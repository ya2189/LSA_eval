chapter
i
whistle
and

sing
as
we
go
there
is
one
thing
in
this
good
old
world
that
is
positively
sure
happiness
is
for
who
to
happy
and
those
who
laugh
happy
everybody
is
eligible
you
me
the
other
fellow
happiness
is
fundamentally
a
state
of
mind
not
a
state
of
body
and
mind
controls
indeed
it
is
possible
to
stand
with
one
foot
on
the
inevitable
banana
peel
of
life
with
both
eyes
peering
into
the
great
beyond
and
still
be
happy
comfortable
and
serene
if
we
will
even
so
much
as
smile
it
all
a
state
of
mind
i
tell
you
and
i
sure
of
what
i
say
why
i
have
taken
up
my
fountain
pen
i
want
to
talk
to
my
friends
you
hosts
of
people
who
have
written
to
me
for
my
recipe
in
moving
pictures
all
i
can
do
is
act
my
part
and
grin
for
you
what
i
say
is
a
matter
of
your
own
inference
but
with
my
pen
i
have
a
means
of
getting
around
the
silent
drama
which
prevents
us
from
organizing
a
with
one
another
in
starting
i
going
to
ask
you
foolish
question
number
do
you
ever
laugh
i
mean
do
you
ever
laugh
right
out
spontaneously
just
as
if
the
police
were
listening
with
drawn
clubs
and
a
finger
on
the
button
connecting
with
the
wagon
well
if
you
do
you
should
off
the
morning
with
a
laugh
and
you
need
worry
about
the
rest
of
the
i
like
to
laugh
it
is
a
tonic
it
braces
me
up
makes
me
feel
fine
and
keeps
me
in
prime
mental
condition
laughter
is
a
physiological
necessity
the
nerve
system
requires
it
the
deep
forceful
chest
movement
in
itself
sets
the
blood
to
racing
thereby
livening
up
the
circulation
which
is
good
for
us
perhaps
you
thought
of
that
perhaps
you
did
realize
that
laughing
automatically
the
blood
blood
and
keeps
it
red
it
does
all
of
that
and
besides
it
relieves
the
tension
from
your
brain
is
more
or
less
a
to
some
it
comes
only
with
practice
but
what
to
hinder
practising
laugh
and
live
long
if
you
had
a
thought
of
dying
laugh
and
grow
well
if
you
sick
and
despondent
laugh
and
grow
fat
if
your
tendency
is
towards
the
lean
and
cadaverous
laugh
and
succeed
if
you
glum
and
unlucky
laugh
and
nothing
can
faze
you
not
even
the
grim
reaper
for
the
man
who
has
laughed
his
way
through
life
has
nothing
to
fear
of
the
future
his
conscience
is
clear
wherein
lies
this
magic
of
laughter
for
magic
it
is
a
something
that
manufactures
a
state
of
felicity
out
of
any
condition
we
got
to
admit
its
charm
automatically
and
inevitably
a
laugh
cheers
us
up
if
we
are
bored
nothing
to
do
just
laugh
that
something
to
do
for
laughter
is
synonymous
with
action
and
action
dispels
gloom
care
trouble
worry
and
all
else
of
the
same
ilk
real
laughter
is
spontaneous
like
water
from
the
spring
it
bubbles
forth
a
creation
of
mingled
action
and
spontaneity
two
magic
potions
in
themselves
the
very
essence
of
laughter
the
unrestrained
emotion
within
us
so
for
me
it
is
to
laugh
why
not
stick
along
the
experiment
hurt
you
all
we
need
is
will
power
and
that
is
a
personal
matter
for
each
individual
to
seek
and
acquire
for
himself
many
of
us
already
possess
it
but
many
of
us
do
not
take
the
average
man
on
the
street
for
example
watch
him
go
plodding
along
no
spring
no
elasticity
no
vim
he
is
in
how
can
he
laugh
when
his
is
all
gone
and
the
in
his
there
any
more
what
he
needs
is
energy
the
power
to
force
himself
into
action
for
him
there
is
no
hope
unless
he
will
take
up
physical
training
in
some
form
that
will
put
him
in
normal
physical
condition
after
that
everything
simplifies
itself
the
brain
responds
to
the
new
blood
in
circulation
and
thus
the
mental
processes
are
ready
to
make
a
fight
against
the
inertia
of
stagnation
which
has
held
them
in
bondage
illustration
you
ever
laugh
and
mind
you
physical
training
does
necessarily
mean
going
to
an
expert
for
advice
one
does
have
to
make
a
mountain
out
of
a
molehill
get
out
in
the
fresh
air
and
walk
briskly
and
do
forget
to
wear
a
smile
while
you
at
it
do
take
it
easy
at
first
and
build
on
your
effort
day
by
day
a
little
this
morning
a
little
more
tonight
the
first
chance
you
have
when
you
sure
of
your
wind
and
heart
get
out
upon
the
country
road
or
hill
and
dale
then
run
run
run
until
you
drop
exhausted
upon
some
grassy
bank
then
laugh
loud
and
long
for
you
on
the
road
to
happiness
try
it
now
do
wait
is
the
day
to
or
if
it
is
night
when
you
run
across
these
lines
drop
this
book
and
trot
yourself
around
the
block
a
few
times
then
come
back
and
you
enjoy
it
more
than
you
would
otherwise
activity
makes
for
happiness
as
nothing
else
will
and
once
you
stir
your
blood
into
little
bubbles
of
energy
you
will
begin
to
think
of
other
means
of
keeping
your
bodily
house
in
order
unless
you
make
a
first
effort
the
chances
are
you
will
do
very
little
real
thinking
of
any
kind
need
pep
to
think
what
an
opportunity
we
miss
when
stripped
at
night
if
we
fail
to
give
our
bodies
a
round
of
exercise
it
is
so
simple
so
easy
and
has
so
much
to
do
with
our
sleep
each
night
and
our
work
next
day
that
to
neglect
to
do
so
is
a
crime
against
nature
and
laugh
man
alive
if
you
are
not
in
the
habit
of
laughing
the
never
miss
a
chance
to
laugh
aloud
smiling
is
better
than
nothing
and
a
chuckle
is
better
still
but
and
out
is
the
real
thing
try
it
now
if
you
dare
and
when
you
done
it
analyze
your
feelings
i
make
this
prediction
if
you
once
start
the
habit
of
exercise
and
couple
with
it
the
habit
of
laughter
even
if
only
for
one
short
week
you
keep
it
up
ever
afterwards
and
by
the
way
friend
reader
do
be
alarmed
the
personal
pronouns
and
give
place
in
succeeding
chapters
to
the
more
congenial
editorial
i
could
resist
the
temptation
to
enjoy
one
brief
spell
of
intimacy
just
for
the
sake
of
good
acquaintance
a
laugh
on
chapter
ii
taking
stock
of
ourselves
experience
is
the
real
teacher
but
the
matter
of
how
we
are
going
to
succeed
in
life
should
not
be
left
to
ordinary
chance
while
we
are
waiting
for
things
to
happen
our
first
duty
is
to
prepare
ourselves
against
untoward
experiences
and
that
is
best
done
by
taking
stock
of
our
mental
and
physical
assets
at
the
very
outset
of
our
journey
what
weaknesses
we
possess
are
excess
baggage
to
be
thrown
away
and
that
is
our
reason
for
taking
stock
so
early
it
is
likely
to
save
us
from
riding
to
a
fall
there
is
one
thing
we
do
want
along
we
will
never
get
anywhere
with
that
nor
with
any
of
its
uncles
aunts
or
cousins
malice
and
in
justice
to
our
own
best
interests
we
should
search
every
crook
and
cranny
of
our
hearts
and
minds
lest
we
venture
forth
with
any
such
impedimenta
there
is
no
excuse
and
we
have
no
one
to
blame
if
we
allow
any
of
them
to
journey
along
with
us
we
know
whether
they
are
there
or
not
just
as
we
would
know
trust
and
were
they
perched
behind
us
on
the
saddle
it
is
idle
to
squeal
if
through
association
with
the
former
we
find
ourselves
ditched
before
we
are
well
under
way
for
it
is
coming
to
us
sooner
or
later
we
might
go
as
some
have
done
through
the
lanes
and
alleys
of
gains
and
luxurious
but
we
would
pay
in
the
end
so
why
not
charge
them
up
to
profit
and
loss
at
the
start
and
kick
them
off
into
the
gutter
where
they
belong
they
are
not
for
us
on
our
eventful
journey
through
life
and
the
time
to
get
rid
of
them
once
and
for
all
is
when
we
are
young
and
mentally
and
physically
vigorous
later
on
when
the
fires
burn
low
and
we
still
have
them
with
us
they
will
be
hard
to
push
aside
to
thine
own
self
be
true
says
the
great
shakespeare
and
how
can
we
be
true
to
our
own
selves
if
we
train
with
inferiors
we
are
known
by
our
companionships
we
will
be
rated
according
to
association
good
or
bad
the
two
will
not
mix
for
long
and
we
will
be
one
sort
of
a
fellow
or
the
other
we
ca
be
both
there
was
a
time
long
years
ago
in
the
days
of
our
grandfathers
when
men
went
to
the
and
later
on
came
back
as
it
were
by
making
a
partial
success
in
life
measured
largely
by
the
money
they
succeeded
in
accumulating
that
was
before
the
system
was
invented
today
things
are
different
questions
are
asked
where
were
you
last
why
did
you
leave
there
have
you
credentials
and
when
we
shake
our
weary
head
and
walk
away
we
fondly
wish
we
had
taken
stock
back
there
when
the
taking
was
good
to
thine
own
self
be
true
and
it
must
follow
as
the
night
the
day
thou
canst
not
then
be
false
to
any
man
when
we
can
analyze
ourselves
and
find
that
we
are
living
up
to
the
quoted
lines
above
we
may
safely
lift
the
limit
from
our
aspirations
right
here
it
is
well
to
say
that
success
is
not
to
be
computed
in
dollars
and
cents
nor
that
the
will
to
achieve
a
successful
life
is
to
be
predicated
upon
the
mere
accumulation
of
wealth
first
of
all
good
health
and
good
minds
then
we
may
laugh
loud
and
long
we
safe
on
first
so
with
these
two
weapons
we
may
dig
down
into
our
aspirations
and
keeping
in
view
that
our
policy
is
that
of
honesty
to
ourselves
and
toward
our
fellow
man
all
we
need
to
do
is
to
go
about
the
program
of
life
cheerfully
and
stout
of
heart
now
we
are
in
a
state
of
we
are
at
the
point
where
vision
starts
along
with
this
vision
must
come
the
courage
of
convictions
in
order
that
we
may
feel
that
our
ideas
are
important
and
because
we
have
such
thoughts
shall
surely
it
has
often
been
noticed
that
when
we
have
had
a
large
conception
and
have
with
force
character
and
strength
of
will
carried
it
into
effect
immediately
thereafter
a
host
of
people
have
been
able
to
say
i
thought
of
that
myself
most
of
us
have
had
the
same
experience
after
reading
of
a
great
discovery
that
we
had
thrown
overboard
because
it
must
not
have
been
worth
while
or
someone
else
would
already
have
thought
of
it
the
man
who
puts
life
into
an
idea
is
acclaimed
a
genius
because
he
does
right
thing
at
the
right
therein
lies
the
difference
between
the
and
a
man
we
all
have
ambitions
but
only
the
few
achieve
a
man
thinks
of
a
good
thing
and
says
now
if
i
only
had
the
money
i
put
that
through
the
word
if
was
a
dent
in
his
courage
with
character
fully
established
his
plan
well
thought
out
he
had
only
to
go
to
those
in
command
of
capital
and
it
would
have
been
forthcoming
he
had
something
that
capital
would
cheerfully
get
behind
if
he
had
the
courage
to
back
up
his
claims
to
fail
was
nothing
less
than
moral
cowardice
will
to
had
not
been
efficient
there
was
a
flaw
in
the
character
after
all
going
back
therefore
to
the
prescription
we
find
that
a
a
an
and
a
of
are
the
essential
elements
of
success
so
when
we
have
conceived
something
for
the
good
of
the
world
and
have
allowed
it
to
go
by
default
we
have
dropped
the
into
the
machinery
of
our
preparedness
we
must
look
about
us
for
a
reason
have
we
fallen
by
the
wayside
of
carelessness
have
we
allowed
ourselves
to
be
discouraged
by
cowardly
ifs
we
lack
the
exactly
so
we
did
have
the
courage
of
our
convictions
life
is
the
one
great
experience
and
those
who
fail
to
win
if
sound
of
body
can
safely
lay
the
blame
to
their
lack
of
mental
equipment
what
does
it
matter
if
disappointments
follow
one
after
the
other
if
we
can
and
try
failures
must
come
to
all
of
us
in
some
degree
but
we
may
rise
from
our
failures
and
win
back
our
losses
if
we
are
only
shrewd
enough
to
realize
that
good
health
sound
mind
and
a
cheerful
spirit
are
necessary
adjuncts
as
tennyson
says
i
held
it
truth
with
him
who
sings
to
one
clear
harp
in
divers
tones
that
men
may
rise
on
of
their
dead
selves
to
higher
things
all
truly
great
men
have
been
healthy
otherwise
they
would
have
fallen
short
of
the
mark
prisons
are
filled
with
nervous
diseased
creatures
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
most
of
these
who
through
ignorance
sifted
through
to
the
bottomless
pits
could
have
saved
themselves
had
they
realized
the
truth
and
taken
stock
of
themselves
of
course
allowing
for
those
who
are
victims
of
circumstantial
evidence
the
prime
necessity
of
life
is
health
with
this
for
mankind
nothing
is
impossible
but
if
we
do
not
make
use
of
this
good
health
it
will
waste
itself
away
and
never
come
back
it
often
disappears
entirely
for
lack
of
interest
on
the
part
of
its
thoughtless
owner
a
little
energy
would
have
saved
the
day
little
pep
and
we
laugh
and
laughter
clings
to
good
health
as
naturally
as
the
needle
clings
to
the
magnet
it
is
the
outward
expression
of
an
unburdened
soul
it
bubbles
forth
as
a
fountain
always
refreshing
always
wholesome
and
sweet
illustration
the
hedge
and
on
his
in
taking
stock
of
ourselves
we
should
not
forget
that
fear
plays
a
large
part
in
the
drama
of
failure
that
is
the
first
thing
to
be
dropped
fear
is
a
mental
deficiency
susceptible
of
correction
if
taken
in
hand
before
it
gains
an
ascendency
over
us
fear
comes
with
the
thought
of
failure
everything
we
think
about
should
have
the
possibility
of
success
in
it
if
we
are
going
to
build
up
courage
we
should
get
into
the
habit
of
reading
looking
at
hearing
associating
with
and
above
all
we
should
cultivate
the
habit
of
mind
of
thinking
clean
and
of
doing
wholesome
things
guard
thyself
that
is
the
slogan
let
us
take
stock
often
and
see
where
we
stand
we
will
not
be
afraid

iii
advantages
of
an
early
start
it
is
the
young
man
who
has
the
best
chance
of
winning
then
why
should
youthfulness
be
made
a
permanent
asset
we
have
recovered
from
the
idea
of
putting
a
man
into
a
sanatorium
just
because
a
few
grey
hairs
show
themselves
in
his
head
we
should
not
ask
him
how
old
he
is
we
should
ask
can
he
the
young
man
may
have
the
advantage
of
years
but
the
older
one
has
the
advantage
of
experience
and
knowledge
now
if
this
older
man
could
carry
along
with
him
that
spirit
of
youth
which
actuated
his
earlier
activities
he
would
be
prepared
against
incapacity
our
fate
hangs
on
how
we
conduct
ourselves
in
youth
the
world
has
great
need
of
the
sober
thoughtful
men
the
fifty
by
right
of
experience
and
knowledge
they
should
become
our
leaders
in
the
shaping
of
our
policies
it
is
all
a
matter
of
how
a
man
comes
through
mentally
physically
and
spiritually
age
should
not
count
against
him
the
first
thought
is
to
keep
healthy
in
fact
we
can
not
harp
on
this
too
much
the
second
requirement
is
confidence
in
ourselves
without
which
our
career
is
short
lived
already
we
perceive
that
one
must
keep
track
of
his
this
breeds
confidence
the
very
fact
that
one
stops
to
probe
into
that
hidden
land
of
thought
shows
that
he
is
keeping
tab
on
himself
with
a
sharp
eye
that
the
stuff
must
fool
the
majority
of
failures
come
as
a
result
of
not
being
able
to
trust
one
self
the
moment
we
doubt
or
acknowledge
that
we
can
not
conquer
a
weakness
then
we
begin
to
go
down
hill
it
is
a
subtle
process
we
hardly
realize
it
at
the
time
but
as
the
days
go
by
the
years
roll
on
the
final
day
of
reckoning
draws
near
and
relentlessly
we
are
swept
along
as
driftwood
toward
the
lonely
beaches
of
obscurity
and
all
because
lacked
we
did
not
realize
it
until
it
was
too
late
we
were
too
busy
with
to
struggle
for
success
most
of
our
troubles
in
later
life
started
with
to
take
hold
of
when
we
were
young
it
may
be
that
we
put
off
making
our
choice
of
something
to
do
if
we
had
been
companionable
to
ourselves
we
might
have
thought
out
the
proper
course
while
taking
long
walks
in
pursuit
of
physical
development
that
would
have
been
a
time
in
which
to
fight
out
the
whole
problem
the
time
when
optimism
and
will
to
are
as
natural
as
the
laughter
of
a
child
or
the
song
of
a
bird
that
was
the
time
when
the
world
appeared
roseate
and
beautiful
when
success
lay
just
beyond
the
turn
of
the
road
when
failure
seemed
something
illusory
and
improbable
then
was
the
time
to
jump
in
with
both
feet
and
big
hearty
to
solve
the
problem
of
what
to
do
and
how
to
go
about
it
it
is
surprising
how
readily
the
world
follows
the
individual
with
confidence
it
is
willing
to
believe
in
him
to
furnish
funds
to
assist
in
any
way
within
its
power
and
that
is
where
the
man
a
is
sure
to
win
for
the
man
who
smiles
has
confidence
in
himself
so
long
as
we
carry
along
with
us
our
atmosphere
of
hearty
good
will
and
enthusiasm
we
know
no
defeat
the
man
who
is
gloomy
taciturn
and
lives
in
a
world
of
doubt
seldom
achieves
more
than
a
bare
living
there
have
been
a
few
who
have
groaned
their
way
through
to
a
competence
but
in
proportion
to
that
overwhelming
number
of
souls
who
carry
cheer
through
life
they
are
as
nothing
mere
drops
in
the
bucket
if
the
truth
were
told
their
success
came
probably
through
mere
chance
and
nothing
else
such
people
are
not
the
ones
for
us
to
endeavor
to
follow
can
not
afford
to
allow
our
visions
to
beginning
early
takes
away
timidity
and
builds
for
success
while
we
are
young
enough
to
enjoy
the
benefits
although
it
is
never
too
late
to
start
a
cheerful
life
we
do
have
to
kill
ourselves
in
the
attempt
there
is
no
necessity
for
throwing
all
caution
to
the
winds
but
we
should
press
our
advantages
with
comes
a
certain
poise
a
certain
dignity
and
kindliness
that
tempers
every
move
with
precision
once
we
get
the
proper
start
we
have
only
to
take
stock
now
and
then
in
order
to
keep
our
machinery
in
a
fine
state
of
repair
if
we
have
chosen
wisely
we
love
our
work
and
stick
to
it
closely
not
forgetting
the
home
duties
and
our
share
in
its
success
right
here
we
run
up
against
the
danger
signal
if
our
business
success
wins
us
away
from
the
hearthstone
of
is
a
quality
of
the
workers
of
the
earth
what
doth
it
profit
a
man
to
win
the
whole
world
if
he
his
own
soul
to
sum
up
the
case
once
we
have
made
up
our
minds
to
win
and
how
we
are
going
to
do
it
the
next
step
is
to
act
is
synonymous
with
the
healthy
man
does
things
the
unhealthy
man
hesitates
and
when
we
get
ready
to
act
we
will
act
with
the
air
of
a
conqueror
we
must
supply
from
our
own
store
our
atmosphere
of
confidence
in
order
to
win
confidence
the
successful
man
is
the
one
who
he
is
and
makes
us
realize
it
it
is
always
worth
while
to
study
the
successes
among
our
acquaintances
are
they
gloomy
morose
and
irritable
if
they
were
to
that
extent
they
would
not
be
successful
on
the
contrary
they
are
robust
confident
individuals
who
have
taken
advantage
of
every
rightful
opportunity
and
possessed
power
to
when
all
about
them
were
in
the
dumps
when
everyone
else
thought
that
there
was
a
chance
to
win
these
fellows
stepped
in
and
took
charge
when
we
interview
the
failures
we
find
that
all
of
them
give
one
excuse
did
have
the
they
may
not
say
it
in
exactly
these
words
but
the
meaning
is
plain
they
ran
through
the
whole
gamut
of
which
is
the
natural
result
of
not
having
started
early
in
the
study
of
self
the
serious
realization
of
their
own
capabilities
illustration
to
pair
with
the
prickly
this
makes
it
easy
to
understand
their
plight
if
we
know
ourselves
we
are
strengthened
that
much
because
we
can
bolster
up
our
weaknesses
we
will
know
enough
to
combat
timidity
we
can
then
know
what
we
are
capable
of
and
thus
become
conscious
of
our
innate
powers
that
only
need
to
be
called
into
action
in
order
to
become
useful
we
can
not
imagine
for
an
instant
a
great
violinist
going
out
on
the
concert
platform
in
ignorance
of
the
condition
of
his
instrument
and
yet
failures
go
out
on
the
stage
of
life
knowing
nothing
of
their
strengths
and
weaknesses
still
expect
to
if
we
are
to
become
successes
we
must
success
in
banish
all
thought
of
losing
success
is
just
as
natural
as
anything
else
it
is
only
a
matter
of
the
mind
anyhow
we
are
all
successes
long
as
we
continue
to
think
is
a
disease
once
it
gets
a
hold
on
us
and
that
is
why
it
is
wise
to
begin
early
to
take
hold
of
affairs
while
we
are
young
superiority
over
our
fellow
man
comes
from
a
superiority
of
mind
and
body
a
healthy
mind
breeds
a
healthy
body
the
most
superficial
study
will
convince
us
of
this
fact
appearance
counts
for
much
in
this
world
we
judge
largely
by
appearances
we
have
time
to
know
everyone
we
meet
intimately
and
as
a
result
must
base
our
opinions
upon
the
fellow
who
comes
in
an
office
with
his
head
hanging
down
between
his
shoulders
and
a
frown
upon
his
face
does
get
far
with
us
we
find
ourselves
looking
over
his
sagging
shoulders
toward
the
individual
behind
him
who
comes
in
with
a
swinging
step
and
the
confidence
born
of
health
and
good
spirits
in
youth
makes
for
in
after
years
this
is
far
from
meaning
that
one
can
be
brazen
and
inclined
towards
freshness
and
get
away
with
it
it
merely
means
the
marshalling
of
forces
command
of
one
and
the
ability
to
make
others
recognize
that
we
are
on
the
map
because
we
belong
there
and
one
of
the
quickest
ways
to
accomplish
this
is
to
have
a
smile
tucked
away
for
instant
use
again
this
does
not
mean
that
we
are
to
carry
round
a
grin
which
we
wear
only
as
we
are
ushered
into
the
presence
of
another
real
smile
or
a
hearty
laugh
is
not
to
be
we
easily
know
the
genuine
from
the
spurious
a
real
laugh
springs
naturally
out
of
a
pure
unadulterated
confidence
and
a
good
physical
condition
what
triumphs
what
splendid
battles
have
been
won
through
the
ability
to
laugh
at
the
right
moment
whenever
we
find
that
we
are
losing
our
ability
to
smile
let
have
no
false
notions
we
are
neglecting
our
physical
well
being
let
us
then
and
there
drop
the
sombre
thoughts
and
get
out
into
the
open
air
run
down
the
street
and
if
possible
out
into
the
country
if
we
see
a
tree
and
have
the
inclination
to
climb
it
well
then
climb
it
if
we
are
sensitive
about
what
our
neighbors
might
say
too
bad
but
we
can
romp
with
easy
grace
if
we
but
knew
how
gladly
our
neighbors
would
emulate
our
gymnastics
if
they
knew
the
value
of
them
the
laugh
would
be
on
us
for
dreading
their
opinion
one
thing
we
do
know
will
envy
us
our
good
health
and
chapter
iv
profiting
by
experience
comes
by
there
is
no
way
we
can
have
experiences
without
passing
directly
through
them
if
we
are
up
and
doing
they
come
thick
and
fast
into
our
lives
some
of
them
weighted
down
by
the
peculiar
twists
and
turns
of
circumstances
others
simple
easily
understood
and
still
others
complicated
to
the
point
of
not
being
understood
at
all
people
are
divided
into
two
classes
who
profit
by
experience
and
those
who
do
the
unfortunate
part
of
it
all
is
that
the
latter
class
is
by
far
the
larger
of
the
two
the
man
of
vigorous
purpose
fine
constitution
and
the
full
knowledge
of
self
sees
through
an
experience
as
clearly
as
through
a
window
the
glass
may
be
foggy
but
he
knows
what
lies
beyond
and
strong
he
seeks
knowledge
through
experience
while
the
weak
man
the
the
inefficient
stands
aside
and
gives
him
the
right
of
way
in
later
years
however
they
bitterly
complain
that
they
were
not
given
the
same
chance
to
succeed
the
man
of
experience
having
long
since
passed
through
the
stages
of
indecision
has
through
careful
learned
to
bridge
difficulties
that
would
make
others
tremble
with
fear
he
knows
that
every
lane
has
a
turning
he
may
not
see
it
at
the
moment
he
may
not
know
where
it
is
that
does
worry
he
picks
up
his
bundle
and
trudges
ahead
confident
that
victory
awaits
him
somewhere
along
the
line
the
fact
that
he
believes
in
himself
sets
him
apart
from
ordinary
mankind
many
great
men
have
been
at
loss
to
understand
why
they
attained
success
it
is
well
nigh
impossible
for
them
to
outline
the
causes
that
led
them
to
the
top
rungs
of
the
ladder
the
reason
is
that
lack
of
of
experiences
was
an
unconscious
one
rather
than
a
conscious
one
however
they
are
willing
to
admit
that
acting
on
the
principle
of
profiting
by
experience
them
with
which
to
proceed
they
soon
came
to
know
opportunity
at
sight
and
had
only
to
look
around
to
find
it
the
young
man
standing
on
the
threshold
of
life
is
from
lack
of
experience
puzzled
over
the
future
he
looks
above
him
and
sees
the
towering
successes
he
reads
in
the
papers
of
the
massive
characters
who
have
risen
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
naturally
he
would
like
to
meet
one
of
these
giants
of
success
and
hear
what
he
has
to
say
the
interview
is
quite
needless
busy
and
profit
by
is
about
all
the
advice
one
man
can
give
to
another
there
is
no
way
to
profit
by
experience
until
we
have
had
experience
so
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
get
busy
and
experience
will
come
as
fast
as
we
can
absorb
it
our
duty
is
to
strive
for
success
and
not
expect
to
attain
it
except
by
successive
steps
a
wholesale
consignment
would
be
our
undoing
quick
successes
through
luck
or
good
fortune
have
not
the
lasting
value
of
those
won
by
virtue
of
knowing
how
of
accomplishing
what
we
started
out
to
do
faith
in
one
self
does
not
come
from
the
outside
it
must
spring
up
naturally
a
healthy
body
and
a
sane
mind
are
the
best
foundations
for
this
the
young
man
who
begins
his
career
with
these
facts
in
mind
is
given
a
running
start
over
his
competitors
poverty
and
failure
are
the
result
of
ignorance
of
the
value
of
worry
anxiety
fear
of
not
doing
the
right
thing
lack
of
insight
into
character
these
too
are
the
result
of
a
lack
of
experience
good
health
is
necessary
to
experience
but
a
majority
neglect
to
take
care
of
it
if
we
are
to
profit
by
what
we
learn
we
have
the
with
which
to
push
forward
we
must
have
every
ounce
of
vitality
we
possess
at
command
ready
for
use
this
we
conserve
for
the
which
we
know
is
coming
new
experiences
are
pushing
us
forward
and
previous
experiences
are
helping
to
move
the
load
experience
tells
us
what
to
do
at
this
point
and
that
and
at
last
puts
its
shoulder
to
the
wheel
and
she
every
mind
is
in
possession
of
an
enormous
amount
of
dormant
power
and
only
experience
can
release
it
into
proper
action
we
often
hear
a
fond
mother
say
that
her
son
is
full
to
bursting
with
the
which
means
that
the
youngster
is
overflowing
with
with
experience
he
could
find
good
use
for
it
but
without
it
this
surplus
may
turn
out
to
be
a
dangerous
possession
young
men
of
this
type
should
be
guarded
most
carefully
and
advised
to
get
busy
in
at
something
worth
while
many
a
bright
fellow
brimming
with
excess
power
has
gone
as
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
into
the
maelstrom
of
vice
because
of
being
held
back
from
he
just
had
to
blow
off
steam
so
he
did
it
in
a
gin
mill
rather
than
a
rolling
mill
this
dynamo
called
the
mind
can
be
trained
to
do
anything
not
only
can
it
be
guided
at
the
start
but
it
can
be
guided
by
all
that
follows
it
can
be
used
for
building
additional
dynamos
to
be
called
into
action
in
times
of
need
this
statement
may
seem
at
first
if
we
think
so
it
is
proof
that
we
have
not
by
our
and
should
get
down
to
stock
taking
before
it
is
too
late
the
practical
man
after
all
is
only
who
takes
advantage
of
he
could
double
and
triple
his
power
if
he
only
realized
how
superficial
the
average
setback
really
is
the
young
man
has
just
as
much
chance
of
being
considered
practical
as
the
older
one
always
provided
that
he
has
a
store
of
experiences
to
profit
by
the
first
of
life
usually
makes
or
breaks
us
for
this
experience
we
need
to
be
prepared
we
must
have
a
that
we
may
bear
defeat
nobly
from
this
is
not
to
be
our
last
kick
our
last
breath
by
a
we
are
going
to
start
all
over
again
after
our
setback
and
we
are
not
going

will
admit
of
no

the
smash
was
a
bad
one
we
will
assume
the
liability
nevertheless
and
get
back
on
the

we
are
out
to
win
and
we
will
and
that
is
what
we

by
taking

from

powers

end
his

by
that
mysterious

as
he
could
make
use
of
it
for
the
good
of
humanity
he
spends
years
of
conscientious
study
and
masters
the

of
it

that
its
uses
are
as
simple
as
his

there
is
no
doubt
in
the
world
but
that
he
had
to
learn
by
experience
he
had
to
go
into
the

and
up
from

there
was
no
other
way
by
which
he
could
come
to
know
how
to
turn
a
deadly
force
into
a
necessity
yet
the
average
man
goes
into
life
with
as
little
knowledge
of
its
forces
as
the
baby
who
puts
its

upon

chapter
v
energy
success
and
laughter
there
are
many
essentials
to
success
but
there
is
one
that
is
of
such
importance
that
without
it
all
the
others
become
as
naught
the
man
who
wins
success
is
invariably
impelled
to
do
the
great
work
allotted
him
by
that
tells
him
he
may
not
know
exactly
what
it
is
but
he
knows
he
possesses
it
and
is
able
to
on
that
accomplishing
things
which
seem
utterly
impossible
to
other
people
this
once
firmly
implanted
in
one
nature
can
not
be
destroyed
or
conquered
and
this
element
is
energy
of
mind
which
rules
the
body
but
where
does
this
come
from
how
do
the
great
minds
generate
this
glorious
means
of
the
answer
is
that
a
healthy
body
it
is
from
birth
and
proper
care
of
the
body
therefore
accentuates
within
their
minds
the
will
to
do
if
the
preceding
chapters
have
been
carefully
read
we
may
readily
believe
that
the
successful
youth
must
start
with
a
wholesome
generous
viewpoint
a
good
constitution
and
a
clean
mind
we
have
had
an
inkling
by
this
time
of
what
one
must
do
to
achieve
success
in
a
world
where
competition
is
keen
we
are
beginning
to
realize
that
these
matters
are
of
vital
importance
and
that
we
are
face
to
face
with
a
problem
energy
is
the
natural
outpouring
of
a
healthy
body
it
must
be
directed
it
must
be
controlled
the
same
as
any
other
living
force
not
only
is
it
a
positive
necessity
to
the
winner
but
it
must
grow
and
become
natural
it
does
not
stand
after
years
of
abuse
it
does
not
spring
up
in
the
night
after
a
long
season
of
neglect
and
all
of
us
possess
it
in
varying
ways
that
fact
ought
to
convince
us
that
we
can
get
hold
of
ourselves
and
build
up
that
which
nature
has
given
us
rather
than
allow
it
to
die
away
we
all
have
a
certain
amount
of
energy
should
we
all
be
we
might
to
a
certain
extent
but
that
does
mean
that
we
shall
all
get
rich
in
the
money
sense
of
the
world
when
we
say
why
should
we
all
be
successes
we
do
not
mean
that
everybody
in
the
world
must
be
greedy
for
money
nor
for
power
and
position
it
does
not
mean
that
we
should
be
selfish
and
eager
to
take
everything
away
from
the
other
fellow
on
the
contrary
it
means
that
with
energy
we
shall
be
successful
to
our
brain
going
back
to
our
second
chapter
we
find
the
phrase
taking
stock
of
ourselves
done
rightly
that
alone
will
inspire
success
now
if
we
are
a
little
farther
along
on
the
way
towards
sane
living
and
the
to
and
we
know
that
after
this
struggle
is
over
the
battle
is
won
we
must
use
the
powers
that
gives
us
the
mere
recognition
of
them
is
power
and
we
must
not
let
them
go
to
waste
energy
is
like
steam
it
can
not
be
generated
under
the
boiling
point
in
other
words
never
produced
it
nor
made
it
a
practical
working
tool
we
must
be
energetic
in
order
to
augment
energy
we
must
have
confidence
along
with
it
the
more
the
merrier
the
greater
the
confidence
in
ourselves
the
greater
the
energy
which
brought
it
about
some
minds
naturally
feel
confident
these
are
the
lucky
ones
the
slender
few
who
have
grasped
life
meaning
at
the
start
by
before
they
were
threatened
with
defeat
success
comes
to
them
as
easily
as
rolling
off
the
proverbial
log
they
come
sweeping
along
conquering
sure
of
themselves
confident
aspiring
true
to
their
inner
selves
ready
for
work
unafraid
of
experiences
and
of
a
smile
when
the
clouds
are
this
does
not
mean
that
these
successes
have
exceptional
ability
if
that
were
the
case
we
would
not
waste
time
either
in
reading
or
writing
about
the
matter
if
we
did
feel
that
we
were
potentially
able
to
become
successes
and
possessed
the
elements
of
victory
in
our
present
not
another
moment
would
be
spent
on
the
subject
the
very
simplicity
of
this
use
of
energy
proves
to
us
that
it
is
a
quality
bubbling
forth
the
least
of
and
the
strongest
it
only
needs
to
be
put
to
work
and
it
becomes
in
the
open
air
sleeping
out
of
doors
taking
the
proper
exercise
looking
wholesomely
upon
life
believing
in
are
all
parts
of
the
sane
existence
which
leads
to
success
and
laughter
we
ought
to
feel
that
everything
in
life
possesses
elements
akin
to
human
feeling
we
should
not
arrogate
to
ourselves
the
sole
right
to
rule
and
reason
and
what
has
this
to
do
with
energy
it
is
only
one
of
the
many
vistas
that
open
to
us
when
we
learn
how
to
laugh
and
live
and
man
alive
we
never
learn
to
laugh
we
will
never
learn
to
we
must
not
forget
that
there
can
be
more
than
one
use
made
of
energy
in
the
same
way
that
electricity
might
be
misused
so
might
energy
be
placed
in
the
wrong
service
we
must
not
waste
any
time
therefore
in
getting
this
energy
of
ours
worked
into
enthusiasm
for
our
life
work
for
our
fellow
man
the
zest
of
we
must
throw
ourselves
into
the
battle
and
carry
the
standard
we
must
leap
to
the
front
not
waiting
for
the
other
fellow
to
show
the
way
spend
your
enthusiasm
freely
and
be
surprised
at
how
it
thrives
on
usage
enthusiasm
being
produced
by
energy
must
of
a
necessity
depend
largely
upon
that
now
the
point
is
how
shall
we
guard
and
keep
fresh
this
element
in
ourselves
we
know
that
the
body
is
producing
this
quality
like
the
steam
engine
we
are
keeping
the
fires
going
by
exercise
wholesome
thinking
and
sincerity
of
purpose
we
are
the
engineers
our
hand
is
on
the
throttle
sharp
turns
lie
ahead
but
our
eyes
look
forward
fearlessly
we
glance
about
us
to
see
that
we
are
in
the
pink
of
condition
we
know
that
our
mind
is
functioning
properly
and
that
the
awakened
confidence
is
already
inherent
in
our
natures
and
stands
beside
us
night
and
day
like
the
officer
upon
the
bridge
of
the
ship
we
are
on
our
way
illustration
little
spin
among
the
out
of
energy
and
enthusiasm
comes
something
else
that
must
not
be
neglected
in
fact
it
must
be
cultivated
and
guarded
from
the
very
beginning
the
mere
possession
of
energy
and
enthusiasm
makes
us
feel
like
laughing
we
want
to
leap
and
jump
and
dance
and
sing
if
we
feel
like
that
do
let
us
be
afraid
to
do
it
out
in
the
air
and
run
like
a
school
boy
jump
ditches
vault
fences
swing
the
arms
never
fail
to
get
next
to
nature
when
responsive
to
the
call
indeed
we
may
woo
this
call
from
within
ourselves
until
it
comes
to
be
second
nature
and
when
we
rise
in
the
morning
let
us
be
determined
that
we
will
start
the
day
with
a
hearty
laugh
anyhow
laugh
because
you
are
alive
laugh
with
everything
yourself
that
is
the
secret
the
ability
to
let
one
self
go
if
we
follow
this
religiously
we
will
be
surprised
how
successful

day
will
be

is
coming
into
its
own
as

greatest
asset
there
was
never
a
day
when
it
was
not
but
in
former
years
this
essential
quality
was
not
listed
under
the
name
had
we
lived
in
the
days
of
our
fathers
youth
we
would
have
heard
about
remarkable
men
men
of
big
caliber
large
character
splendid
presence
and
the
like
but
it
remained
for
our
day
and
generation
to
discover
the
real
word
meaning
the
perfect
combination
possible
of
man
highest
at
least
that
would
be
the
definition
in
its
fullest
sense
of
course
everyone
has
a
certain
personality
and
no
matter
in
what
degree
its
possession
is
valuable
personality
is
an
acorn
so
to
speak
which
may
be
cultivated
into
a
sturdy
oak
personality
is
self
outwardly
it
represents
the
conquest
of
our
weaknesses
and
naturally
impresses
our
strength
of
character
upon
others
with
personality
our
foundation
is
firm
on
this
pedestal
we
may
stand
squarely
and
face
life
with
equanimity
for
such
there
is
no
end
to
achievement
while
good
health
and
youthful
spirit
remain
it
is
impossible
to
come
into
the
presence
of
a
personality
without
becoming
immediately
aware
of
it
it
is
reflected
by
people
of
stature
poor
physiques
homely
as
well
as
men
of
the
highest
physical
development

great
napoleon
was
just

while

men

are
the
last
to
say
die
their
store
of
carries
them
beyond
their
real
span
of
existence
either
in
years
or
achievement

shows
its
mastery

is
filled
with
incidents
where
men
of
personality
have
turned
defeat
into
victory
by
leading
their
soldiers
back
into
the
fray
wholesome
personality
is
the
fulfillment
of
physically
mentally
and
spiritually
but
all
personality
is
not
wholesome
for
it
often

the
face
of
the

therefore
all
personality
is
not
for
the
good
of
the
world
it
is
only
of
the
wholesome
kind
that
we
speak
to

as
possess

is
made
up
of
many
qualities
and
differs

as
man
is
different
from
his

perfect
personality
requires
constant
care
in
its
development
and
constant
guard
for
its
safety
it
can
not
be
purchased
in
the
open
market
it
must
be
built
upon
piece
by
piece
and
everything
we
are
becomes
a
part
of
it
personality
would
be
indeed
imperfect
if
it
did
not
give
us
if
we
neglect
our
physical
poise
we
pull
down
our
mental
poise
likewise
our
spiritual
poise
that
is
why
personality
must
be
kept
constantly
protected
against
encroachment
but
this
can
be
so
fixed
by
purpose
plan
and
power
of
will
that
it
becomes
automatically
safeguarded
once
in
possession
we
have
only
to
make
it
part
of
our
natural
selves
and
it
to
the
last
breath
of
life
then
the
question
is
why
should
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
satisfied
with
an
imperfect
personality
it
only
reflects
back
upon
ourselves
we
often
heard
a
man
say
is
all
right
perhaps
the
personality
in
question
was
untidy
or
that
his
walk
was
that
of
a
laggard
or
that
he
affected
an
egotistical
air
of
superiority
whatever
the
impairment
it
should
have
been
done
away
with
a
man
of
personality
should
never
be
haunted
with
worry
from
the
sneers
of
his
inferiors
because
of
their
own
laxity
some
men
perfect
their
manner
of
speech
to
a
degree
which
takes
it
above
that
of
their
weaker
fellows
others
develop
fine
qualities
which
are
viewed
by
ordinary
individuals
as
affectations
but
which
are
in
reality

days

but
to
those
who
have
the
benefit

backed

have

that
success
of

is
predicated

keeping
in

is
no

at
all
we

make
it
a

physical
action
and
as
keeping
in

means
perfection

the

must

it
will
have
small
chance
of
obtaining
a
grip
on
us
later
is
the
one
quality
with
which
to
crown
our
highest
it
is
final
proof
that
we
are
capable
of
just
thought
and
square
dealing
and
is
proof
positive
that
we
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
wholesome
spirit
which
rules
the
universe
its
possession
is
greater
than
riches
for
its
dividend
is
happiness
and
contentment
and
we
can
not
go
wrong
if
we
so
live
that
we
can
look
any
man
in
the
eye
and
him
the
to
live
in
the
full
sense
means
to
be
alert
whatever
high
moral
plane
we
shall
achieve
must
be
held
against
all
temptation
there
is
no
compromise
is
nothing
less
than
we
only
fool
ourselves
and
soon
find
ourselves
slipping
down
hill
it
will
be
hard
climbing
getting
back
and
what
of
the
wear
and
tear
on
our
ambitions
meanwhile
honesty
does
not
grow
naturally
out
of
a
dull
uninspired
life
it
goes
with
the
energetic
the
forceful
the
dull
soul
who
is
content
to
plod
along
year
after
year
in
the
same
rut
may
be
honest
and
this
one
redeeming
feature
may
be
of
such
inestimable
value
to
him
that
it
sweetens
and
softens
his
entire
days
it
will
bring
him
friends
friends
who
will
excuse
all
other
shortcomings
of
his
it
gives
him
the
unadulterated
trust
of
his
employer
and
it
arouses
a
certain
admiration
among
his
narrow
circle
of
acquaintances
if
this
is
true
with
the
dullard
the
weakling
then
what
must
it
mean
possessed
by
the
we
know
for
instance
how
the
nation
instinctively
turned
to
general
washington
when
it
came
to
choosing
their
president
after
the
revolutionary
war
he
may
have
been
gifted
he
may
have
been
one
of
the
world
greatest
captains
but
the
one
quality
which
endeared
him
to
his
countrymen
was
a
tremendous
moral
superiority
never
told
a
rang
around
the
world
summed
up
his
virtues
amounted
to
those
five
words
some
statesmen
may
have
been
more
astute
but
washington
was
honest
never
told
a
the
people
knew
they
could
trust
this
man
so
they
elected
him
to
fill
the
highest
place
within
their
gift
honesty
with
ourselves
is
the
first
thing
to
remember
unless
we
are
it
will
be
impossible
for
us
to
enter
into
that
spiritual
contentment
enjoyed
by
those
who
honest
with
themselves
if
we
are
untrue
to
ourselves
how
can
we
be
true
to
others
the
framework
of
a
man
moral
being
must
be
that
of
honesty
it
must
become
his
very
nature
and
become
automatic
in
its
processes
it
belongs
to
the
healthy
those
who
keep
themselves
well
through
exercise
and
temperate
it
is
not
a
quality
set
aside
for
the
lucky
few
every
man
woman
and
child
possesses
it
in
some
degree
and
only
its
constant
neglect
trims
it
to
a
minimum
it
is
one
of
those
fundamentals
of
life
one
of
those
powerful
and
moving
forces
that
rule
society
are
either
honest
or
we
are
we
can
not
be
and
get
away
with
it
when
one
stops
to
consider
honesty
even
for
a
moment
its
full
importance
is
realized
for
example
imagine
having
a
dishonest
friend
could
we
go
to
him
with
the
secrets
of
our
heart
could
we
trust
him
would
we
trust
anyone
who
might
turn
traitor
again
suppose
we
were
untrue
to
ourselves
and
the
fact
became
known
could
we
blame
others
if
they
passed
us
up
as
a
companion
never
in
a
thousand
years
must
sleep
in
the
beds
we
prepare
for
men
have
grown
accustomed
through
the
years
to
certain
standards
these
are
now
the
moral
laws
which
control
and
guide
the
destinies
of
entire
races
whole
generations
there
must
have
been
a
good
reason
for
these
laws
or
they
could
never
have
come
into
being
society
does
not
adopt
many
unnecessary
rules
but
among
the
vital
laws
stands
out
in
bold
it
has
become
deeply
imbedded
in
the
minds
of
mankind
that
everyone
must
be
true
to
himself
it
is
taken
for
granted
that
those
who
are
not
would
naturally
be
to
the
reason
for
this
lies
in
the
fact
that
society
will
not
proceed
with
any
course
of
action
without
being
able
to
trust
its
members
the
general
in
charge
of
an
army
would
have
a
hard
time
of
it
if
he
were
unable
to
place
faith
in
the
subordinate
to
whom
he
gave
instructions
that
might
lead
to
a
crisis
in
the
battle
society
would
dash
itself
upon
the
rocks
were
it
not
conscious
that
certain
people
are
courageously
honest
in
these
it
finds
its
to
rise
in
life
means
that
our
fellow
man
believes
in
us
and
wishes
us
to
do
so
without
his
it
would
be
futile
to
arouse
our
own
ambitions
we
could
not
hope
to
win
a
victory
all
alone
and
against
the
great
majority
who
believe
in
certain
standards
and
conditions
we
might
fool
ourselves
into
thinking
that
because
of
some
stroke
of
fortune
we
had
established
an
immunity
for
ourselves
but
some
day
would
tell
us
how
feebly
we
had
succeeded
there
is
only
one
method
only
one
way
rise
through
honesty
and
an
optimistic
belief
in
self
and
let
us
not
plume
ourselves
because
of
our
virtue
honesty
is
our
due
to
ourselves
and
our
fellow
one
of
the
distinctive
elements
in
the
honest
man
is
that
of
laughter
the
ones
who
live
up
to
their
ideals
do
not
feel
that
life
is
such
a
dark
place
after
all
it
may
mean
hard
work
little
play
and
often
delayed
rewards
but
the
fact
that
there
is
a
world
and
that
it
is
filled
with
other
honest
souls
is
reward
enough
to
give
us
courage
to
laugh
as
we
go
along
can
always
afford
to
laugh
when
the
man
who
is
innately
honest
has
no
reason
to
fear
the
snares
of
fortune
he
knows
that
he
can
win
the
trust
of
men
he
knows
that
he
already
has
it
he
has
no
dread
of
looking
into
the
other
fellow
eye
he
knows
where
he
stands
in
life
he
has
won
that
which
he
has
through
struggle
and
he
does
not
intend
to
lose
it
he
does
not
intend
to
fail
can
not
fail
he
can
not
no
matter
how
things
might
go
at
this
moment
or
that
the
next
will
find
him
on
the
rising
tide
of
new
opportunities
chances
his
reputation
travels
before
him
like
the
advance
agent
his
coming
is
heralded
and
he
is
welcomed
into
any
community
it
is
as
though
there
were
only
a
few
honest
men
this
welcome
this
glad
hand
is
always
extended
by
society
to
the
honest
man
as
a
token
of
approval
the
world
work
is
a
tremendous
matter
there
is
always
room
for
another
worker
to
handle
some
part
of
it
and
only
the
true
the
sincere
are
capable
of
doing
this
in
the
proper
way
the
leaders
of
society
in
the
broader
sense
are
those
win
the
faith
of
the
average
we
look
up
to
lincoln
because
we
know
that
he
was
the
one
man
in
a
million
to
accomplish
the
greatest
task
ever
set
before
a
human
being
we
realize
that
he
was
honest
in
the
huge
so
necessary
to
the
accomplishment
of
big
ideals
and
we
know
that
in
order
to
win
some
part
of
that
great
trust
we
must
obey
the
standards
of
honesty
and
decency
that
lie
below
the
surface
and
only
need
to
be
called
to
life
and
action
in
order
to
be
used
and
laughter
will
arouse
that
sense
as
quickly
as
anything
else
the
man
who
is
capable
of
laughing
heartily
is
not
apt
to
be
the
one
who
carries
some
thought
around
with
it
is
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
detect
an
untrue
laugh
the
real
laugh
springs
out
of
the
depths
of
being
and
comes
with
a
ringing
sense
of
security
and
in
one
it
goes
with
the
workman
in
the
early
morning
when
he
swings
along
the
road
to
the
factory
it
accompanies
the
soldier
into
battle
it
arouses
the
clerk
from
lethargy
it
brightens
the
sick
room
it
raises
us
all
to
unexplored
heights
and
as
evidence
of
our
state
of
mind
it
can
only
mean
one
thing
honesty
and
sincerity
no
character
can
exist
without
this
outward
exhibition
of
an
inward
honesty
mere
cultivation
of
laughter
would
eventually
lead
to
the
fact
that
you
are
laughing
enjoying
life
awakens
you
to
a
spirit
of
security
and
a
feeling
of
the
joy
of
living
gloomy
men
are
the
ones
whose
tendency
is
toward
crime
and
trouble
laughing
men
are
the
ones
who
stir
the
world
with
new
desires
and
make
life
worth
living
therefore
we
say
and
illustration
scene
from
his
picture
in
the
papers
chapter
viii
cleanliness
of
body
and
mind
if
we
interview
many
of
life
failures
we
will
find
that
the
overwhelming
majority
went
down
because
of
their
neglect
to
get
out
of
an
environment
that
was
not
stimulating
and
because
their
ambitions
had
grown
rusty
and
inefficient
to
cope
with
depressing
circumstances
the
prisons
and
other
institutions
are
filled
with
people
who
did
not
make
any
attempt
to
get
away
from
the
vicious
surroundings
in
which
they
lived
they
were
like
tadpoles
that
had
never
grown
to
frogs
they
just
kept
swimming
around
in
their
muddy
puddles
and
not
having
grown
legs
with
which
they
could
leap
out
onto
the
banks
and
away
to
other
climes
they
continued
to
swim
in
monotonous
circles
until
they
died
in
other
words
the
failure
is
a
man
who
dwells
in
muddy
atmosphere
all
his
days
who
is
content
to
remain
a
tadpole
and
who
never
attempts
to
take
advantage
of
any
opportunity
he
becomes
unclean
so
to
speak
and
that
is
what
we
mean
by
this
chapter
heading
of
body
and
it
was
not
intended
to
point
out
the
proper
way
to
keep
our
faces
and
hands
clean
or
as
a
sermon
but
rather
to
show
ourselves
that
clean
body
begets
the
clean
the
two
together
constituting
compelling
tendencies
toward
clean
a
move
in
the
direction
of
these
takes
us
out
of
the
rut
of
life
no
matter
what
cause
we
dig
up
with
which
to
explain
our
success
in
life
we
can
not
neglect
this
most
important
one
careful
selection
of
our
and
this
does
mean
that
one
must
be
a
snob
far
from
it
it
only
means
that
the
successful
man
the
man
who
wishes
to
rise
in
life
should
not
spend
his
days
in
the
company
of
who
do
not
possess
of
heart
or
the
will
to
do
the
work
of
the
it
means
that
life
is
too
short
to
hang
around
the
loafing
places
with
the
driftwood
of
humanity
listening
to
their
stories
of
failure
and
drinking
in
with
liquor
some
of
their
bitterness
against
those
who
have
toiled
and
won
the
fruits
of
their
toil
it
means
that
we
will
not
go
out
of
our
way
to
seek
the
friendship
of
men
and
women
who
are
simply
endeavoring
to
gain
happiness
in
life
without
paying
for
it
it
means
that
we
will
do
all
in
our
power
to
win
friends
who
and
by
so
doing
inspire
those
with
whom
they
come
in
contact
such
men
are
naturally
clean
of
mind
and
body
we
must
remember
always
to
live
in
a
world
of
clear
thought
that
will
our
dwelling
in
the
dark
corners
of
life
and
traveling
with
the
débris
of
humanity
will
not
arouse
us
to
action
and
give
us
that
swinging
vigor
of
heart
and
mind
so
necessary
to
the
accomplishment
of
great
things
while
we
will
ever
lend
the
helping
hand
to
those
who
need
it
we
will
naturally
associate
with
those
who
have
vim
and
courage
we
will
not
be
down
by
our
until
we
meet
the
right
kind
we
will
hold
aloof
and
we
will
not
be
morose
and
gloomy
because
it
happens
that
at
this
moment
our
acquaintanceship
does
not
include
these
successes
when
we
have
succeeded
in
doing
something
big
they
will
come
to
us
and
we
think
big
things
we
are
likely
to
do
it
is
all
a
matter
of
the
will
to
do
nothing
succeeds
like
success
said
some
very
wise
man
and
if
there
ever
was
a
phrase
that
rang
with
truth
this
does
it
means
that
the
of
the
courage
that
with
leads
to
and
more
it
means
that
the
thinker
of
these
thoughts
is
living
in
a
clean
wholesome
atmosphere
along
with
those
who
are
determined
and
in
earnest
it
means
that
they
have
caught
the
fervor
of
true
life
a
healthy
contagious
fervor
which
permeates
the
blood
swiftly
once
it
gets
a
hold
and
like
electricity
it
vivifies
and
stirs
the
spirit
with
renewed
energy
after
day
year
after
once
it
wins
us
it
will
stick
with
us
the
success
of
those
about
us
will
shake
our
lethargic
limbs
and
stimulate
us
to
a
desire
to
do
as
they
do
we
will
be
in
a
world
of
clean
thought
and
action
and
our
lives
will
mirror
their
lives
our
thoughts
will
be
filled
with
wholesome
things
and
with
good
health
we
will
win
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
cleanliness
is
morale
of
the
body
and
the
the
man
who
is
careful
of
his
linen
and
who
does
not
neglect
his
morning
plunge
is
not
apt
to
be
gloomy
and
morose
we
notice
him
in
the
car
or
on
the
street
in
the
morning
he
comes
striding
along
fresh
and
full
of
zest
of
his
mind
is
clear
and
unclouded
his
eyes
are
full
of
that
vigorous
light
of
conscientious
desire
to
win
and
do
so
honestly
he
has
none
of
the
hypocritical
elements
in
his
nature
strong
enough
to
rule
him
there
may
be
and
probably
are
many
weaknesses
in
his
character
his
very
strength
consists
in
his
ability
to
them
and
make
them
his
the
man
who
has
taken
his
morning
plunge
and
dressed
himself
agreeable
to
comfort
and
grace
has
his
battles
of
the
day
won
in
advance
he
knows
the
value
of
keeping
himself
in
trim
he
does
it
for
the
sake
of
feelings
our
approval
of
his
appearance
goes
without
saying
if
a
man
thinks
well
of
himself
in
matters
of
appearance
his
general
deportment
is
likely
to
coincide
such
men
never
overdo
they
are
at
ease
with
themselves
and
thus
impart
ease
to
others
who
come
in
contact
with
them
they
have
in
other
words
a
distinction
of
their
own
and
distinction
is
their
they
know
that
the
highest
moral
law
of
nature
is
that
of
cleanliness
that
filthiness
should
not
be
allowed
to
dominate
any
man
ethics
or
physical
condition
they
rule
such
things
out
of
their
lives
a
vast
magnetic
force
comes
out
of
those
friends
of
ours
who
are
and
making
the
world
up
and
take
the
mere
fact
that
we
live
near
to
them
know
them
and
associate
with
them
is
that
we
too
shall
go
through
life
with
clean
minds
and
bodies
they
would
not
tolerate
us
if
we
were
to
slip
into
shoddy
ways
nothing
is
revealed
quicker
to
our
intimates
than
losing
of
the
slipping
into
careless
habits
we
can
not
conceal
it
from
them
we
fool
only
those
who
brush
by
the
loss
of
this
has
a
terrible
effect
upon
the
system
and
every
tendency
toward
success
is
thereby
stunted
and
weakened
have
fallen
into
unclean
ways
it
will
not
be
long
before
we
sink
to
the
bottom
or
else
remain
among
the
vast
crowd
who
have
neither
the
courage
to
fall
nor
the
courage
to
rise
nothing
produces
failure
quicker
than
filthiness
of
mind
and
body
those
who
are
successful
keep
away
from
the
very
thought
of
such
a
condition
they
live
as
much
as
possible
the
they
take
morning
and
evening
exercises
they
read
good
books
attend
good
plays
and
are
continually
in
touch
with
the
finer
developments
of
thought
and
art
in
the
world
their
faces
are
open
and
full
of
sunlight
they
are
determined
that
life
will
not
beat
them
in
a
game
that
only
requires
sureness
of
aim
and
the
ability
to
take
advantage
of
the
thousand
and
one
opportunities
that
surround
them
on

perhaps
no

vital

who
succeeds
the
general
of
an
army
first
looks
to
the
of
his
troops
he
knows
that
with
clean
minds
and

his
soldiers
are
capable
of
doing
big
things
the
battleship
that
efficient
and
instrument
of
war
is
so
immaculate
that
one
could
eat
his
meals
on
its
very
decks
its
officers
are
wholesome
athletic
fellows
its
crew
consists
of
hardy
men
who
live
sanely
and
vigorously
and
who
have
plenty
to
occupy
their
minds
and
if
cleanliness
is
fundamental
in
their
case
why
not
in
our
own
when
we
come
to
analyze
ourselves
we
find
that
we
are
like
a
great
institution
of
some
kind
here
is
the
brain
the
heart
the
lungs
the
stomach
the
nerves
and
the
muscles
each
department
acts
separately
and
yet
is
connected
absolutely
with
all
the
others
the
entire
system
is
under
one
supreme
department
now
if
this
ruling
department
is
kept
clean
and
full
of
kindly
beautiful
thoughts
does
it
not
seem
natural
that
the
rest
will
follow
its
lead
being
so
completely
in
its
power
we
realize
this
and
the
mere
realization
is
something
done
towards
the
accomplishment
of
an
ideal
life
in
a
world
of
cleanliness
and
beauty

finest
tools
in

build
life
into
something
worth

be
run
on
a
system
as
well
as
the
the
stomach
must
not
be
overloaded
with
unnecessary
food
the

roosevelt
perhaps
more
than
any
other
living
man
today
has
given
vitality
to
the
supreme
necessity
of
of
mind
and
he
has
by
reason
of
his
great
prominence
been
able
to
emphasize
these
two
vital
essentials
he
called
a
spade
a
spade
and
his
message
went
far
from
those
who
knew
the
value
of
his
words
came
nods
of
approval
took
from
boyhood
he
has
systematized
his
life
taking
the
exercise
needed
filling
his
mind
with
the
learning
of
the
world
winning
when
others
would
have
failed
profiting
by
experience
allotted
to
him
through
fate
kindly
offices
and
association
with
the
true
what
has
been
the
result
he
has
risen
to
the
very
pinnacle
of
human
endeavor
honors
await
he
has
lived
consistently
and
cleanly
and
he
can
look
any
man
in
the
eye
and
say
honestly
have
lived
as
i
have
it
is
not
necessary
to
become
president
in
order
to
live
sanely
to
gain
from
circumstances
the
fruits
that
are
ours
for
the
asking
and
which
have
fallen
into
roosevelt
hands
with
such
profusion
we
can
not
all
become
presidents
but
we
can
all
a
shining
example
of
mental
and
bodily
just
as
we
plunge
into
the
cold
water
in
the
early
morning
so
should
we
regularly
during
the
day
plunge
into
the
society
of
those
whose
splendid
enthusiasm
is
helping
to
make
the
world
a
better
place
to
live
in
they
are
the
kind
who
go
into
the
struggle
with
heads
high
and
with
clean
hearts
their
eyes
see
beyond
the
daily
toil
of
life
they
are
in
touch
with
the
big
things
and
it
is
up
to
us
to
keep
step
with
them
they
want
us
and
they
will
give
us
the
glad
hand
all
they
want
to
know
is
whether
our
courage
is
equal
to
our
ambitions
and
whether
our
of
life
is
kept
in
good
and
so
we
journey
along
together
in
all
good
nature
not
forgetting
to
laugh
as
we
live

consideration
for
others
consideration
for
others
is
man
noblest
attitude
toward
his
fellow
man
for
every
seed
of
human
kindness
he
plants
flower
blooms
in
the
garden
of
his
own
in
him
who
gives
in
such
a
way
there
is
no
hypocritical
feeling
of
charity
bestowed
his
very
act
disarms
the
thought
it
is
as
natural
for
an
honorable
man
to
show
consideration
to
others
as
it
is
for
him
to
eat
and
sleep
acts
of
kindness
are
the
manifestations
of
gentle
a
refinement
of
character
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
word
what
would
we
do
in
this
world
without
the
helping
hand
the
friendly
word
of
cheer
the
thought
that
others
shared
our
losses
and
cheered
our
victories
if
consideration
for
our
feelings
and
thoughts
did
not
exist
on
this
earth
we
would
never
know
the
depths
of
the
love
of
our
friends
there
would
be
no
such
thing
as
an
earthly
reward
of
merit
we
know
that
no
matter
what
happens
to
us
in
the
battle
of
life
there
will
be
someone
to
cheer
us
on
our
way
we
may
be
strong
and
thoroughly
able
to
rely
upon
ourselves
but
there
comes
a
time
when
we
need
friendship
and
sympathy
society
would
crumble
into
dust
without
these
influences
the
family
circle
would
degenerate
into
a
hollow
mockery
if
consideration
each
for
the
other
was
absent
it
sweetens
and
makes
wholesome
what
otherwise
might
only
be
an
existence
of
monotonous
toil
consideration
for
others
is
milk
of
human
for
what
we
do
for
others
our
recompense
is
the
act
we
should
claim
no
other
reward
observation
brings
to
view
that
they
who
give
in
real
charity
their
acts
from
the
eyes
of
all
save
the
givers
of
this
type
rise
to
the
supreme
heights
of
greatness
it
is
a
part
of
their
wisdom
to
know
what
is
best
to
be
done
and
they
go
about
it
as
a
pleasure
as
well
as
a
duty
consideration
for
others
pays
big
dividends
it
is
a
virtue
that
makes
for
strong
friendships
and
true
affections
those
who
possess
it
have
a
hard
time
hiding
their
light
under
a
bushel
in
teaching
fortitude
to
others
they
partake
of
the
same
knowledge
in
the
hours
of
their
own
affliction
they
retain
their
courage
and
keep
their
minds
unsoured
they
are
the
good
fellows
of
and
their
presence
is
the
signal
for
instantaneous
good
cheer
we
all
know
them
by
their
gentle
knock
at
the
door
in
a
thousand
ways
they
impress
themselves
upon
our
lives
have
entered
into
our
councils
have
given
us
the
right
advice
at
the
right
time
and
when
the
sad
day
comes
along
strong
shoulders
are
there
for
us
to
lean
consideration
for
others
is
apt
to
be
an
inherent
quality
but
like
everything
else
it
can
be
accentuated
or
modified
according
to
our
own
determination
it
is
a
growth
that
should
be
inculcated
in
the
lives
of
the
earlier
the
better
a
child
most
impressionable
age
is
said
to
be
between
its
fourth
and
fifth
years
then
is
the
time
to
teach
it
the
little
niceties
of
life
the
closing
of
a
door
softly
quietly
that
mother
may
not
be
awakened
from
her
nap
tidiness
cleanliness
good
morals
all
of
which
are
to
become
vital
factors
in
a
life
of
consideration
for
others
a
great
many
of
us
have
the
desire
to
be
of
service
to
others
but
holds
us
back
say
for
instance
one
might
see
a
person
in
great
distress
and
because
of
diffidence
withhold
the
proffered
hand
someone
we
known
who
comes
to
the
point
of
penury
but
has
much
to
ask
assistance
we
pass
by
fearful
that
we
might
offend
how
many
times
has
this
happened
to
us
who
knows
but
the
best
friend
we
have
at
this
very
moment
would
give
anything
in
the
world
if
his
pride
would
let
him
bridge
that
distance
between
us
illustration
scene
from
the
americano
matching
wits
for
nevertheless
the
desire
to
do
the
right
thing
was
in
itself
helpful
the
thought
of
doing
something
for
someone
was
a
correct
impulse
and
should
have
been
carried
into
action
early
in
life
we
should
have
started
our
foundation
for
doing
things
in
the
cause
of
others
putting
off
the
time
when
we
shall
begin
to
obey
our
higher
impulses
toward
helpfulness
to
our
fellows
is
but
a
reaction
in
our
own
characters
which
we
want
to
do
but
we
do
as
time
goes
on
we
just
that
all
our
good
intentions
have
gone
to
pave
the
bottomless
pits
containing
our
unfulfilled
heart
promptings
we
meant
well
we
failed
to
we
did
have
the
courage
our
failures
spread
a
gloom
before
us
lost
our
chances
for
a
happy
life
the
man
with
the
ability
to
laugh
has
little
diffidence
about
these
matters
having
confidence
in
himself
and
being
happy
and
alert
he
goes
to
the
friend
in
need
with
courage
and
the
kind
of
help
that
helps
if
he
does
do
it
directly
he
finds
a
way
to
reach
him
through
mutual
friends
he
does
not
go
about
his
kindness
either
he
has
gained
a
sincere
and
beautiful
pleasure
out
of
aiding
an
old
friend
and
he
can
go
on
his
way
rejoicing
that
life
is
worth
living
when
he
has
lived
up
to
its
higher
ideals
consideration
for
others
does
not
necessarily
involve
only
the
big
things
it
is
the
sum
and
total
of
numberless
acts
and
thoughts
that
make
for
friendships
and
kindliness
people
who
are
thoughtful
surely
brighten
the
world
they
are
ever
ready
to
do
some
little
thing
at
the
correct
moment
and
after
a
time
we
begin
to
realize
how
much
their
presence
means
to
us
we
may
not
notice
them
the
first
time
or
the
third
or
the
fifth
but
after
a
while
we
become
conscious
of
their
persistence
and
we
esteem
them
accordingly
such
men
are
the
products
of
straightforward
they
are
never
too
busy
to
exchange
a
pleasant
word
they
do
not
flame
into
anger
on
a
pretext
their
code
of
existence
is
well
ordered
and
filled
to
the
brim
with
lots
to
do
and
lots
to
think
about
the
old
saying
you
want
anything
go
to
a
busy
applies
to
them
in
this
regard
the
busier
men
are
the
more
time
they
seem
to
have
for
another
word
for
consideration
is
service
nothing
brings
a
greater
than
a
service
done
in
an
hour
of
need
or
a
favor
granted
during
a
day
grind
the
generous
man
who
climbs
to
the
top
of
the
ladder
helps
many
others
on
their
way
the
more
he
does
for
someone
else
the
more
he
does
for
the
stronger
he
becomes
the
greater
his
influence
in
his
community
doing
things
for
others
may
not
bring
in
but
it
does
bring
in
such
actions
scorn
a
higher
reward
we
have
only
to
try
out
the
plan
to
learn
the
truth
for
ourselves
a
good
place
to
begin
is
then
or
wherever
life
leads
us
and
in
doing
these
things
we
will
laugh
as
we
go
along
we
will
laugh
and
get
the
most
out
of
living
our
little
kindnesses
when
added
together
constitute
in
time
a
huge
asset
on
the
right
side
of
our
ledger
of
life
we
should
start
the
day
with
something
that
helps
another
get
through
his
day
even
if
it
is
any
more
than
a
smile
and
a
wave
of
the
hand
and
he
will
remember
us
for
it
it
is
said
that
advice
is
cheap
and
for
that
reason
is
given
freely
but
the
proper
kind
of
advice
is
about
as
rare
as
the
proverbial
tooth
in
order
to
give
real
advice
we
must
understand
the
man
who
asks
for
it
if
what
we
say
to
him
is
to
become
of
value
we
must
see
to
it
that
his
mind
is
put
in
proper
shape
to
receive
advice
be
sure
that
he
laughs
or
smiles
at
least
before
we
seriously
take
up
his
case
and
when
we
have
done
our
stunt
in
the
way
of
advice
let
send
him
away
with
a
fine
good
humor
a
friendly
pat
on
the
back
as
he
goes
out
our
doorway
may
mean
a
bracer
to
his
determination
put
it
we
shout
after
him
and
thus
we
have
been
of
real
help
he
needed
sympathy
and
courage
he
needed
a
cheerful
spirit
so
came
to
us
and
we
did
let
him
go
away
until
we
gave
him

of
our

it
is
well
to
make
a
point
of
this
fact
in
this
world
are
many
who
fail
to
profit
by
advice
and
thereby

big
words
and

never
were
designed
for
the
highest
types
of
men
our
great
national
figures
have
almost
without

had
one
quality
which
was
a
keynote
to
their
ultimate
success
this
was
their

are
so
manifold
that
in
order
to
accomplish
what
has
been
placed
in
their
hands
they
must
be
saved
from
interruption
but
the
truly
great
individual
is
never
hidden
away
entirely
from
his
fellow
man
he
never
becomes
such
a
slave
to
detail
that
he
does
not

to
fraternize
with
ordinary
mortals
we
do
not
find
him
concealed
behind
impenetrable
barriers
guarded
and
pampered
by
courtiers
like
unto
a
king
on
his
throne
or
tucked
away
in
some
dark
office
he
wants
to

new
he
is
not
the

to
refuse
to
see
us
at

reasonable
time
we
should
not
confound
however
with

no

to
close
his
brain
to
outside
information
he
is
forced
to
keep
it
open
in
order
to
let
in
continuous
currents
of
new
thought
he
does
want
his
visage
to
and
mantle
as
a
standing
as
shakespeare
aptly
puts
it
therefore
the
windows
of
his
thinking
department
are
kept
open
for
refreshing
draughts
from
the
outside
he
reasons
that
always
there
are
new
guests
new
faces
new
things
to
talk
about
at
the
banquet
board
of
life
illustration
on
local
and
here
is
the
point
if
men
who
carry
on
the
great
industries
of
the
world
find
a
way
to
keep
themselves
democratic
surely
men
of
less
importance
should
be
able
to
do
the
same
the
snob
is
about
as
offensive
a
person
as
could
be
described
he
is
usually
a
hypocrite
or
an
ignoramus
sometimes
both
his
pomposity
is
naturally
repellent
we
easily
become
accustomed
to
dodging
such
characters
the
detriment
is
theirs
not
ours
they
are
left
by
the
wayside
and
sooner
or
later
wake
up
to
the
fact
that
they
stand
alone
in
the
world
the
world
loves
the
man
with
open
this
is
the
usual
spirit
of
the
progressive
citizen
wants
to
and
by
reason
of
his
accessibility
knowledge
is
brought
to
him
no
one
cares
to
take
up
the
task
of
informing
the
egotist
who
already
knows
it
all
such
is
his
inherent
cussedness
that
we
would
rather
let
him
warp
in
the
oven
of
his
own
knowledge
life
is
too
short
to
waste
our
time
in
educating
him
how
can
i
see
mr
says
one
man
to
another
do
try
is
the
answer
he
not
worth
seeing
you
ca
tell
anything
and
this
sort
of
a
chap
misses
the
big
opportunities
just
because
he
chooses
to
build
up
a
reputation
for
being
exclusive
he
digs
himself
a
hole
and
crawls
into
it
pulls
the
hole
in
after
we
can
safely
imagine
him
treating
the
members
of
his
family
as
though
they
were
servants
and
his
employees
as
though
they
were
slaves
he
may
succeed
in
small
things
but
in
the
big
game
of
life
we
may
write
him
down
as
a
failure
if
we
have
a
big
idea
we
take
it
to
a
big
man
man
of
anything
less
is
to
putter
around
aimlessly
the
bigger
he
is
the
more
democratic
he
will
not
look
for
imperfections
in
our
personal
when
we
show
him
the
we
have
discovered
to
be
democratic
is
a
triumph
of
the
soul
tending
to
bring
us
in
close
touch
with
the
throbbing
heart
of
humanity
there
is
no
isolation
for
those
of
unaffected
charm
and
manner
no
barrier
in
the
way
of
friendship
worth
having
it
is
our
lack
of
judgment
if
we
hide
ourselves
so
that
we
can
not
be
approached
no
matter
how
high
we
rise
for
the
sake
of
our
own
brains
we
must
allow
of
to
get
to
us
we
must
not
allow
our
minds
to
become
stagnant
if
we
fail
to
get
into
daily
contact
with
other
people
we
soon
grow
dull
and
uninteresting
even
to
ourselves
great
men
may
have
no
time
to
fritter
away
but
they
have
plenty
of
leisure
for
men
worth
while
pushers
and
the
a
democratic
spirit
does
not
come
to
the
selfish
man
he
is
absorbed
in
himself
and
is
quite
a
hopeless
case
he
is
a
natural
born
faultfinder
and
grouchy
by
nature
for
him
life
holds
no
joy
save
the
one
in
sight
taking
the
big
look
at
the
man
of
this
type
we
can
only
be
sorry
for
him
because
of
his
lack
of
early
training
he
started
off
on
the
wrong
foot
and
thereafter
drifted
along
seldom
do
we
overcome
the
habits
with
which
we
arrive
at
man
estate
those
who
do
are
entitled
to
a
right
hand
seat
among
the
chosen
being
democratic
is
another
phrase
for
being
and
it
means
that
we
ought
to
be
able
to
see
behind
every
face
and
find
the
truth
of
that
individual
existence
it
means
that
life
is
largely
a
matter
of
how
we
look
at
it
and
being
human
is
one
way
to
get
the
proper
slant
at
things
the
human
mind
has
adaptive
and
can
be
molded
into
a
thousand
ways
of
thinking
the
intelligent
man
the
man
who
has
taken
stock
of
himself
is
able
to
smile
and
extend
a
hearty
handclasp
whether
he
feels
or
not
he
does
have
to
look
glum
simply
because
the
world
has
thrown
itself
at
his
feet
he
has
only
to
persevere
and
success
will
come
eventually
we
must
correct
our
failings
as
we
go
along
or
we
will
slip
down
into
the
rut
and
stay
there
it
is
a
simple
matter
to
be
good
natured
and
full
of
the
zest
of
life
if
we
poise
ourselves
right
ourselves
it
is
this
great
soul
quality
which
brings
us
true
friends
and
boosts
us
into
the
fulfillment
of
our
ambitions
then
we
may
truly
and
chapter
xi
by
good
reading
the
character
of
a
man
expresses
itself
by
the
books
he
reads
every
man
since
the
invention
of
printing
has
been
a
close
reader
of
a
few
books
that
stand
out
from
among
the
many
we
read
of
lincoln
devouring
the
few
books
he
had
over
and
over
again
and
studying
from
cover
to
cover
and
word
for
word
the
webster
dictionary
of
his
day
we
know
that
grant
had
his
favorite
volumes
from
which
he
drew
inspiration
and
solace
these
men
made
eternal
friends
of
certain
great
thinkers
and
drank
in
their
learning
with
all
the
fervor
of
their
natures
a
few
good
books
digested
well
do
feed
the
mind
feed
the
mind
that
the
idea
how
shall
we
feed
the
answer
is
easy
with
something
something
that
will
inform
and
inspire
we
can
cram
our
minds
to
the
point
of
indigestion
with
useless
frivolous
information
just
as
easily
as
we
may
cram
our
stomachs
with
certain
foods
that
tear
down
rather
than
build
up
the
habit
of
reading
the
right
sort
of
books
should
begin
early
in
life
and
continue
throughout
our
days
good
books
are
real
and
as
we
read
we
feel
hear
see
and
understand
in
the
way
the
author
did
if
what
is
said
appeals
to
our
way
of
thinking
new
is
unfolded
to
our
vision
filled
to
the
brim
with
things
we
can
think
about
and
add
to
our
stock
of
knowledge
while
we
are
buried
in
its
leaves
we
may
live
over
the
thoughts
that
the
writer
lived
for
the
time
being
he
becomes
as
real
and
vital
to
us
as
the
dearest
friend
we
possess
gradually
as
the
time
passes
by
he
creeps
into
our
affections
until
our
lives
would
not
be
complete
without
the
comradeship
of
his
cherished
book
books
that
become
our
pals
are
not
necessarily
books
of
the
classical
type
little
known
volumes
may
prove
to
have
enough
thought
stored
away
between
their
covers
to
keep
us
interested
all
our
days
the
great
books
will
prove
their
worth
in
a
short
time
no
matter
how
poor
the
binding
how
bad
the
type
or
how
cheap
the
paper
these
things
are
after
all
only
the
outward
manifestations
and
though
we
like
to
see
our
friends
dressed
well
yet
we
know
that
the
clothes
do
not
make
character
unless
there
is
character
there
in
the
first
place
and
so
it
is
with
books
these
little
ungainly
volumes
which
we
purchase
on
the
stands
may
be
the
classics
of
tomorrow
who
knows
we
select
our
library
carefully
no
matter
if
we
live
in
a
tiny
hall
bedroom
on
the
top
floor
of
a
boarding
house
we
have
a
shelf
somewhere
with
a
few
good
books
on
it
emerson
essays
can
be
had
in
one
volume
and
are
well
worth
having
no
other
american
writer
has
been
so
inspiring
so
invigorating
as
this
thinker
of
concord
one
can
not
read
his
essays
without
having
a
desire
to
up
and
it
is
like
a
breath
of
fresh
air
a
tonic
a
stiff
morning
walk
it
stirs
the
mind
to
action
and
inspires
us
to
lift
ourselves
out
of
the
rut
into
which
we
have
fallen
one
returns
to
them
time
after
time
each
reading
opening
up
new
vistas
of
thought
new
lines
of
mental
development
illustration
scene
from
his
picture
in
the
papers
a
man
stomach
is
what
he
eats
a
man
mind
is
what
he
it
goes
without
saying
that
no
healthy
active
mind
could
exist
without
the
companionship
of
shakespeare
nowadays
it
is
possible
to
secure
the
entire
works
of
the
immortal
poet
in
one
volume
there
is
a
special
oxford
university
edition
which
can
be
had
for
a
small
sum
the
type
is
large
the
paper
good
and
there
are
many
notes
to
help
one
over
the
rocky
places
there
is
no
doubt
of
the
truth
of
the
saying
that
a
man
who
reads
shakespeare
consistently
and
with
understanding
needs
no
other
education
like
the
philosopher
emerson
he
boiled
down
the
thoughts
into
terse
sentences
and
one
goes
into
a
new
universe
when
reading
any
of
the
plays
it
is
a
good
thing
to
learn
parts
of
them
by
heart
so
that
we
can
apply
them
to
our
own
lives
they
strengthen
the
mind
their
beauty
lifts
us
into
a
great
realism
of
splendid
thought
and
they
fill
the
heart
with
a
longing
to
do
something
great
such
books
should
become
steady
companions
through
life
no
matter
where
our
duties
call
us
we
should
see
to
it
that
we
do
not
leave
behind
the
thoughts
of
this
master
mind
of
shakespeare
the
very
fact
that
we
have
them
near
us
lifts
us
out
of
the
monotony
of
nothing
to
do
among
the
books
about
america
for
americans
perhaps
roosevelt
winning
of
the
west
is
among
the
best
not
only
has
he
thrown
the
whole
vigor
of
his
interesting
personality
into
the
writing
of
it
but
he
has
given
us
a
vivid
picture
of
the
conquest
of
the
states
by
the
settlers
no
man
could
read
it
without
being
thrilled
at
the
dangers
our
forefathers
faced
at
the
great
courage
they
possessed
at
their
hardihood
their
bulldog
tenacity
the
reading
of
such
a
book
is
like
going
back
over
the
years
and
living
with
them
sharing
their
troubles
and
their
enthusiasms
the
man
who
contemplates
gathering
a
small
library
could
not
afford
to
do
without
the
inspiration
of
what
his
countrymen
have
done
for
him
in
choosing
our
books
we
must
bear
in
mind
one
thing
them
be
let
them
be
of
such
a
nature
that
when
we
read
them
we
will
feel
like
going
out
into
the
world
to
accomplish
something
that
is
probably
the
mission
of
great
books
to
inspire
and
uplift
the
world
greatest
men
have
been
readers
would
they
have
cared
for
books
unless
they
were
inspiring
it
is
said
that
when
napoleon
was
being
taken
to
helena
he
advised
one
of
the
officers
never
to
stop
reading
most
of
the
things
worth
while
are
at
some
time
or
other
stored
away
in
books
by
the
thinkers
every
phase
of
history
every
movement
to
better
mankind
and
lift
it
above
the
drudgery
of
mere
toil
every
beautiful
thought
is
to
be
found
in
them
and
the
better
the
book
the
more
will
be
found
in
it
of
these
very
things
when
we
have
finished
the
day
work
we
can
pull
down
a
volume
from
the
shelf
and
in
a
moment
be
lost
in
an
entirely
different
world
the
man
who
neglects
to
read
surely
misses
the
one
best
means
of
broadening
his
mind
all
books
of
the
better
class
furnish
food
for
thought
and
are
excellent
tools
for
the
man
of
initiative
to
read
means
keeping
in
touch
with
the
big
visions
we
cherish
these
dreams
and
make
them
real
in
plans
of
our
own
aspiration
is
behind
the
pages
of
every
volume
it
was
the
motive
power
which
drove
the
author
to
produce
it
and
it
should
become
a
part
of
the
forces
which
drive
us
on
to
victory
without
such
inspiration
we
grope
as
children
in
the
dark
we
are
without
a
light
to
guide
us
on
our
way
books
by
such
men
as
marden
and
hubbard
are
great
generators
of
the
electricity
of
doing
things
they
have
put
into
words
those
innermost
emotions
which
are
the
instruments
of
success
they
point
out
a
way
we
may
safely
follow
they
loan
us
inspiration
which
causes
us
to
act
for
ourselves
they
give
us
thoughts
that
are
useful
and
practical
which
we
never
would
have
gained
by
virtue
of
our
own
reasoning
power
they
made
it
a
life
work
to
coin
into
phrases
words
that
inspire
out
of
their
large
experience
came
the
logical
sequences
of
cause
and
effect
not
to
profit
by
their
teachings
is
a
crime
against
our
own
prospects
without
them
we
lag
behind
instead
of
progressing
we
look
on
in
wonder
at
what
is
going
on
in
the
world
somehow
we
can
not
connect
ourselves
with
the
big
enterprises
and
all
because
we
failed
to
feed
our
minds
properly
there
is
much
to
be
gained
both
in
pleasure
and
knowledge
by
reading
historical
novels
and
the
lives
of
great
men
the
books
of
sir
walter
scott
and
james
fenimore
cooper
are
rated
among
the
best
in
the
world
grant
autobiography
and
the
personal
stories
of
other
famous
americans
provide
fascinating
material
with
which
to
establish
and
fortify
our
test
for
good
literature
the
tales
of
modern
american
financiers
is
another
field
of
absorbing
interest
the
man
with
small
means
can
provide
himself
with
a
working
library
for
a
very
little
money
books
are
cheap
the
public
library
is
always
nearby
and
there
is
hardly
a
town
of
any
size
but
what
has
one
when
we
purchase
a
book
we
should
be
sure
to
obtain
the
best
edition
and
be
careful
that
it
is
printed
from
good
type
and
on
clear
paper
books
are
likely
to
become
warm
friends
we
should
never
purchase
an
abridged
edition
binding
is
not
such
an
important
factor
although
we
like
to
have
favorite
put
up
in
a
handsome
fashion
with
shakespeare
emerson
roosevelt
scott
cooper
marden
and
hubbard
one
would
have
quite
a
representative
collection
for
a
start
it
would
be
easy
to
expand
the
list
into
many
more
of
course
those
collecting
a
small
library
who
have
a
specialty
will
want
books
dealing
with
the
subjects
in
which
they
are
interested
however
every
practical
library
includes
books
of
inspirational
character
and
if
one
makes
a
study
of
the
books
written
by
great
authors
it
will
be
found
that
all
of
them
profited
by
the
reading
of
books
which
caused
them
to
think
bible
causes
us
to
think
and
no
library
is
complete
without
chapter
xii
physical
and
mental
preparedness
it
is
not
the
object
of
this
chapter
to
deal
with
a
set
course
of
physical
culture
but
rather
to
emphasize
the
necessity
of
keeping
our
physical
house
in
order
there
are
plenty
of
books
on
physical
culture
which
can
be
relied
upon
and
also
any
number
of
physical
instructors
who
are
able
to
advise
and
help
along
a
set
program
there
are
hundreds
of
places
institutions
clubs
and
the
like
which
provide
gymnasiums
and
every
other
facility
for
those
who
determine
to
build
themselves
up
through
consistent
physical
exercise
that
is
all
very
well
to
begin
with
but
afterward
we
must
have
some
simple
methods
of
our
own
which
will
not
make
it
a
hardship
or
a
chore
to
keep
ourselves
in
trim
state
of
physical
it
should
become
a
part
of
our
daily
scheme
to
obey
certain
simple
rules
which
tend
toward
an
instead
of
a
discipline
and
we
should
persevere
in
these
until
they
become
it
is
no
trouble
at
all
to
take
exercise
unconsciously
and
we
only
arrive
at
this
by
turning
into
an
exercise
any
of
our
ordinary
physical
actions
during
the
day
as
we
go
along
for
instance
we
can
sit
down
in
a
chair
and
in
so
doing
can
add
a
certain
amount
of
exercise
to
the
action
itself
also
in
rising
with
very
little
effort
we
can
come
into
the
habit
of
sitting
correctly
posing
the
body
as
it
should
be
holding
the
shoulders
in
proper
position
also
the
chin
so
that
it
becomes
a
hardship
to
sit
improperly
all
of
this
has
to
do
with
in
walking
we
can
go
along
with
a
spring
elasticity
and
vigor
of
motion
which
forces
a
fine
blood
circulation
throughout
the
entire
system
we
can
stoop
over
in
the
act
of
picking
up
some
object
from
the
floor
and
at
the
same
time
make
it
a
matter
of
physical
exercise
and
we
may
take
a
hat
from
the
rack
while
standing
away
from
it
thus
stretching
ourselves
as
it
were
into
a
little
needful
action
putting
on
an
overcoat
or
any
part
of
our
clothing
may
be
done
in
such
a
way
as
to
set
the
blood
to
racing
through
the
body
morning
and
night
upon
getting
up
and
upon
retiring
there
is
every
reason
to
make
it
a
rule
to
exercise
freely
the
morning
exercise
wakes
us
up
and
sits
us
down
finally
at
the
breakfast
table
with
a
zest
for
the
food
set
before
us
the
morning
bath
is
an
agency
for
good
in
this
direction
after
we
have
given
ourselves
a
good
from
head
to
foot
by
the
same
token
exercises
at
night
before
retiring
induces
sound
sleep
and
takes
away
the
strain
of
the
preceding
day
a
very
successful
system
is
that
of
exercising
in
bed
instead
of
immediately
jumping
to
the
floor
in
the
morning
it
is
very
inviting
to
go
through
some
simple
form
of
gymnastics
in
which
the
physical
structure
is
brought
into
play
physical
exercise
is
something
which
can
be
carried
to
extremes
we
can
go
at
the
work
so
intensely
that
we
become
and
develop
some
structural
enlargements
that
we
do
not
need
this
happens
very
often
among
athletes
the
ordinary
man
should
fight
shy
of
such
plans
superfluous
strength
is
only
for
those
who
have
need
of
it
what
we
really
want
is
strength
enough
to
carry
us
through
our
daily
rounds
with
comfort
and
feeling
of
in
a
sense
we
all
live
by
our
wits
and
these
decline
when
not
properly
fed
by
our
general
physical
organization
prize
fighters
are
not
the
longest
lived
people
nor
are
the
professional
athletes
their
calling
requires
extra
building
up
which
would
be
a
positive
handicap
to
the
average
man
whose
manner
of
life
does
require
this
in
other
words
there
are
intemperate
methods
of
exercising
just
as
there
are
of
eating
and
drinking
we
may
easily
go
too
far
again
we
can
sin
just
as
greatly
by
not
going
far
enough
there
was
a
time
when
men
of
forty
were
as
worn
and
old
as
men
of
and
seventy
are
today
as
a
matter
of
fact
nowadays
a
mark
is
no
longer
a
badge
of
senility
when
a
man
has
kept
himself
fit
and
treated
himself
right
we
all
have
friends
who
are
pretty
well
along
in
years
by
virtue
of
their
carefully
planned
physical
training
plus
their
they
are
as
sprightly
and
companionable
as
though
they
were
many
years
younger
we
should
come
to
know
early
in
life
what
a
large
part
plays
in
in
previous
chapters
hearty
laughter
was
extolled
as
one
of
the
very
best
of
exercises
it
is
an
organizer
in
itself
and
opens
up
the
heart
and
lungs
as
nothing
else
will
do
it
makes
the
blood
go
galloping
all
through
the
system
it
is
one
of
the
best
automatic
in
the
business
laughter
takes
the
stress
off
of
the
mind
and
whatever
is
ahead
of
us
for
the
day
that
seems
likely
to
become
a
burden
is
soon
turned
into
an
ordinary
circumstance
we
smile
as
we
go
about
doing
it
a
friend
once
said
to
a
banker
how
do
you
know
when
to
lend
money
the
banker
replied
i
look
a
man
in
the
eye
and
then
do
or
i
the
friend
said
i
would
like
to
borrow
ten
thousand
dollars
now
you
shall
have
it
sir
the
banker
replied
this
meant
that
the
man
who
asked
for
the
loan
was
in
a
state
of
physical
and
mental
preparedness
if
he
had
gone
into
the
office
looking
like
an
animated
tombstone
he
would
have
had
much
of
a
chance
to
borrow
the
ten
thousand
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
hearty
fellow
inspires
confidence
there
is
nothing
coming
to
the
sour
chap
and
that
what
he
usually
gets
and
what
we
get
is
largely
a
matter
of
our
physical
well
being
a
modern
philosopher
observed
that
the
blues
are
the
product
of
bad
livers
and
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
he
was
right
the
problem
of
life
is
to
fill
our
days
with
sunshine
in
so
doing
we
shall
find
that
the
little
graces
are
those
which
will
lend
us
the
most
help
tiny
favors
extended
words
of
encouragement
courtesies
of
all
sorts
unselfish
work
carried
out
in
an
open
manner
true
friendships
and
love
a
hearty
laugh
a
sincere
appreciation
of
the
other
fellow
struggle
to
keep
his
head
above
water
the
conscientious
carrying
out
of
all
tasks
assigned
us
these
are
our
helpmates
and
they
are
the
products
of
our
physical
and
mental
equipment
through
these
we
come
into
our
knack
of
detecting
friends
among
those
who
are
salt
of
the
it
is
impossible
for
the
person
who
desires
good
health
to
obtain
it
or
having
it
to
retain
it
without
consistent
effort
a
watch
will
not
run
without
the
proper
regulation
of
the
mainspring
we
must
keep
up
our
activities
we
have
taken
the
earth
and
are
turning
it
into
something
to
serve
us
therefore
the
need
of
fine
bodily
preparedness
nothing
can
take
the
place
of
achievement
and
it
comes
through
physical
and
mental
efficiency
the
one
must
not
be
neglected
for
the
other
both
must
be
cultivated
and
developed
alike
in
order
that
each
may
help
the
other
happiness
comes
only
to
those
who
take
care
of
themselves
it
is
the
natural
product
of
no
pleasure
can
surpass
that
of
a
conscious
feeling
of
our
strength
of
character
it
is
an
all
important
element
in
men
who
aspire
to
succeed
the
man
who
rises
in
the
morning
from
a
healthy
slumber
and
plunges
into
the
bath
after
some
vigorous
exercise
is
prepared
to
undertake
anything
his
world
seems
fair
and
though
the
sun
may
not
be
shining
literally
it
is
to
all
intents
and
purposes
thus
we
go
swinging
along
with
a
cheery
smile
carrying
the
message
of
hope
and
joy
to
all
those
with
whom
we
come
in
contact
oh
it
fine
to
be
physically
and
mentally
fit
chapter
xiii
and
failure
the
correct
definition
of
is
because
is
comprised
of
an
aggregation
of
vices
large
and
small
and
failure
is
the
logical
sequence
thereof
even
the
habit
of
eating
may
be
cultivated
into
a
vice
indeed
there
are
those
who
gorge
without
restraint
which
in
itself
is
unchaste
and
immoral
we
often
seen
them
as
with
napkin
under
foot
or
tucked
under
the
collar
they
eat
their
way
through
mountains
of
food
and
wash
it
down
as
they
reach
for
more
no
use
to
say
how
and
what
we
feel
when
we
attend
such
performances
it
is
all
right
to
say
look
the
other
way
it
ca
be
it
is
human
nature
to
gaze
upon
horror
sometimes
in
sympathy
but
more
often
in
amazement
sometimes
a
well
staged
scene
of
gormandizing
viewed
from
a
seat
in
the
second
or
third
row
center
of
a
softly
lighted
thick
carpeted
food
emporium
us
the
price
of
our
own
we
no
longer
hunger
on
our
own
account
our
appetite
is
appeased
by
proxy
so
to
speak
and
we
calmly
fix
our
eyes
on
the
big
show
and
for
a
baseball
no
wonder
a
noted
bachelor
of
medicine
declares
people
are
what
they
eat
the
exclamation
point
is
our
own
we
quite
agree
with
our
medical
brother
for
we
have
seen
people
eat
until
we
thought
would
never
be
hungry
again
but
there
is
more
to
than
the
food
specialist
has
to
answer
for
so
we
will
be
on
our
way
for
instance
there
is
surely
he
is
entitled
to
a
short
stanza
we
all
know
him
he
goes
on
the
theory
that
he
has
all
the
spending
money
in
the
world
and
that
long
after
he
is
dead
those
on
whom
he
spent
it
will
remember
his
generosity
vain
hope
whatever
memory
of
him
remains
will
be
of
a
different
kind
those
who
have
been
bored
by
his
gratuitous
attentions
will
take
up
the
threads
of
their
existence
where
they
left
off
when
he
drove
them
away
from
their
usual
haunts
no
longer
will
they
have
to
dodge
down
alleys
and
run
up
strange
stairways
in
an
effort
to
avoid
his
overtures
illustration
fairbanks
in
the
good
when
alive
and
in
full
operation
he
knew
more
about
what
was
best
for
us
than
we
could
possibly
think
of
knowing
left
to
his
own
devices
he
would
have
us
smoke
his
particular
brands
drink
his
labels
eat
his
selections
wear
his
kind
of
a
cravat
overcoat
cap
hat
shoes
and
underwear
and
to
make
his
proposition
sound
business
like
he
would
willingly
pay
the
bills
in
this
little
amusement
we
are
supposed
to
play
the
part
of
receiver
and
his
whatever
may
be
our
verdict
on
this
chap
we
must
keep
in
mind
that
his
inordinate
desire
to
waste
his
substance
was
no
less
than
a
vice
if
for
no
other
reason
than
its
example
upon
others
it
is
just
as
bad
to
be
receiver
as
it
is
to
be
if
we
can
not
build
up
a
reputation
for
generosity
without
becoming
ostentatious
we
might
better
take
lessons
in
refinement
from
someone
to
the
manor
born
there
is
no
desire
to
single
out
and
set
down
by
name
and
number
every
sort
of
of
any
kind
are
and
it
is
easy
to
fall
into
them
if
we
have
not
built
up
our
stamina
to
resist
our
failures
are
usually
traceable
to
ourselves
no
matter
what
excuses
may
be
offered
in
our
behalf
we
know
in
our
own
minds
that
we
are
to
blame
somewhere
along
the
line
of
our
endeavors
we
faltered
we
our
conservatism
reinforced
by
our
strength
of
character
finally
gave
way
at
a
given
point
and
put
the
whole
plant
out
of
business
our
system
of
inspection
had
become
cursory
instead
of
painstaking
everything
had
been
running
along
so
smoothly
we
forgot
that
everything
wear
out
in
time
if
it
is
looked
after
properly
a
previous
chapter
entitled
taking
stock
of
ourselves
has
a
specific
bearing
upon
the
subject
in
hand
it
emphasizes
the
necessity
of
taking
stock
of
ourselves
early
in
life
in
order
that
we
may
know
our
weak
spots
and
take
immediate
steps
to
dig
them
out
by
the
roots
and
replace
them
with
which
thrive
on
and
on
unto
the
last
day
and
that
reminds
us
that
it
is
well
to
take
stock
of
ourselves
every
little
while
even
hardy
perennials
have
to
be
looked
after
the
ground
kept
fertile
and
watered
against
the
draughts
of
forgetfulness
and
neglect
and
so
it
must
be
with
our
mental
and
physical
processes
in
order
that
each
day
of
our
lives
we
may
go
forth
with
renewed
forcefulness
with
every
atom
of
character
in
full
working
order
having
started
off
on
the
right
foot
we
are
less
likely
to
have
trouble
with
our
higher
resolves
during
the
lean
and
hungry
years
of
our
youth
when
we
go
plunging
headlong
toward
the
goal
of
our
ambitions
usually
it
is
not
until
we
come
into
easy
street
that
we
find
that
we
dropped
something
somewhere
along
the
line
which
we
must
replace
at
once
or
we
will
be
laid
up
for
repairs
but
lo
and
behold
easy
street
is
fair
to
look
upon
it
dazzles
the
eye
it
takes
hold
of
the
sensibilities
everybody
wears
sunday
clothes
on
this
street
and
seems
to
be
superlatively
happy
surely
it
would
hurt
to
linger
awhile
and
see
what
is
going
on
why
this
is
the
most
talked
about
street
in
the
world
some
of
the
people
we
have
dealt
with
have
told
us
about
it
they
said
it
was
only
for
a
man
of
means
for
there
could
be
found
the
very
things
for
which
we
strive
in
life
they
told
us
that
the
people
we
would
meet
represented
the
higher
order
of
intelligence
brainy
alert
accomplished
a
grand
thoroughfare
for
those
who
would
know
life
in
the
fullness
thereof
now
it
is
a
fact
that
easy
street
may
be
crossed
and
recrossed
in
safety
every
day
of
our
lives
if
we
do
not
tarry
financial
competence
might
permit
of
it
but
competent
efficiency
demands
that
we
trot
along
get
away
before
we
settle
down
into
its
ways
the
action
we
need
is
not
along
this
brilliant
lane
but
suppose
we
do
take
a
chance
just
to
test
the
serene
confidence
which
we
think
is
so
safely
nailed
down
within
us
the
very
thought
of
it
makes
the
caution
bell
tinkle
in
our
ears
but
caution
is
a
species
of
cowardice
after
all
we
say
a
man
of
may
dare
anything
and
just
at
the
moment
we
waver
who
comes
along
but
our
old
friend
the
well
dressed
carefree
fellow
who
once
told
us
all
about
easy
street
and
invited
us
to
look
in
on
him
sometime
nothing
would
please
him
more
than
to
show
us
the
whole
works
and
here
he
is
shaking
us
by
the
hand
and
pulling
us
along
for
he
is
an
affable
fellow
and
will
not
take
no
for
an
answer
our
struggle
is
feeble
a
huge
chunk
of
our
strength
of
character
falls
off
into
space
then
and
there
even
at
the
gilded
entrance
we
try
again
to
beg
off
to
slip
away
but
will
not
hear
so
together
we
go
through
the
portals
leading
into
a
grandeur
we
had
never
known
beyond
our
experience
and
power
to
believe
is
likely
to
become
the
turning
point
in
our
bill
nye
once
said
when
we
start
down
hill
we
usually
find
everything
greased
for
the
occasion
we
might
add
the
chapter
xiv
living
beyond
our
means
living
beyond
our
means
is
a
big
subject
that
must
be
treated
broadly
for
circumstances
alter
cases
there
is
a
sane
way
to
look
at
every
problem
and
the
matter
of
living
beyond
our
means
is
one
of
the
major
problems
we
have
to
face
if
every
man
was
alike
and
every
avocation
in
life
was
on
a
parity
it
would
be
possible
to
dispose
of
this
subject
in
a
paragraph
but
men
are
not
alike
what
one
could
do
successfully
might
easily
baffle
another
therefore
it
seems
advisable
to
consider
the
subject
by
looking
into
its
depths
to
most
people
debt
is
terrifying
to
some
it
means
nothing
and
thus
we
have
individual
temperament
as
an
angle
from
which
to
consider
living
beyond
our
ability
to
pay
means
going
into
debt
via
the
shortest
route
getting
out
of
debt
means
a
revision
of
our
code
to
the
extent
of
ceasing
to
live
beyond
our
means
and
saving
something
with
which
to
pay
off
what
we
owe
some
men
can
do
this
successfully
others
fail
while
seemingly
trying
their
best
to
succeed
and
still
others
do
nothing
to
stem
the
tide
with
these
it
is
a
matter
of
how
the
tide
serves
if
favoring
winds
should
drive
them
to
opulence
they
would
more
than
likely
pay
up
particularly
those
imbued
with
personal
to
make
good
such
are
the
exigencies
of
life
we
may
as
well
concede
that
a
vast
majority
at
some
time
or
other
find
it
necessary
to
owe
more
than
they
can
readily
pay
emergencies
arise
which
force
us
into
expenses
that
require
credit
and
if
we
have
so
ordered
our
lives
that
when
the
pinch
comes
have
no
credit
the
fact
that
we
pay
out
our
last
dollar
and
go
hungry
to
bed
does
not
bring
us
much
sympathy
thus
it
would
seem
that
to
be
able
to
say
i
pay
as
i
go
or
i
owe
no
man
a
dollar
or
i
never
live
beyond
my
means
is
not
much
of
a
boast
when
after
a
death
in
the
family
or
other
unforeseen
circumstances
we
find
ourselves
broke
and
nowhere
to
turn
for
accommodation
it
has
been
aptly
said
that
can
save
themselves
to
in
other
words
one
may
develop
the
saving
habit
to
such
an
extent
that
laugh
and
live
can
find
no
room
beside
us
on
the
perch
of
our
existence
we
must
admit
that
the
systematic
saver
of
pennies
misses
a
lot
as
he
goes
along
and
with
time
degenerates
into
a
sort
of
kill
joy
in
the
matter
of
regulating
his
family
to
his
way
of
thinking
he
usually
has
an
uphill
job
sons

home
as
soon
as
they
can
daughters

and
breathe
a
sigh
of
relief
leaving
mother
behind
to
slave
on
order
that
the
hoard
may
while
all
of
this
is
true
it
only
represents
extreme
cases
therefore
it
should
not
be
construed
that
this
chapter
is
launched
against
habit
of
rather
its
purpose
is
to
suggest
the
thought
of
not
at
the
expense
of
our
best
plan
would
be
to
save
in
reason
not
forgetting
that
life
is
here
to
enjoy
as
we
go
along
then
too
we
must
have
a
among
our
fellow
mortals
just
the
same
as
a
business
person
must
have
credit
rating
among
financial
institutions
illustration
things
with
sister
from
the
habit
of
happiness
credit
in
business
is
worth
more
than
money
because
it
allows
for
expansion
whereas
money
in
the
bank
is
only
good
far
as
it
many
a
merchant
who
bought
and
sold
for
cash
all
his
life
found
when
he
came
to
enlarge
his
business
that
one
thing
was
lacking
the
fact
that
he
had
always
paid
cash
threw
a
doubt
upon
his
financial
condition
when
he
proposed
to
borrow
he
had
neglected
to
build
up
a
credit
as
he
went
along
the
business
world
only
knew
him
as
a
man
who
paid
cash
and
exacted
cash
taken
at
his
fullest
inventory
he
had
scalped
a
living
out
of
the
world
for
which
he
had
done
but
little
to
make
happier
or
better
one
calamity
might
easily
scuttle
his
prospects
forever
for
instance
a
fire
or
a
bank
failure
and
without
credit
it
would
be
difficult
to
start
over
again
by
all
means
we
must
save
something
for
the
rainy
day
as
we
go
along
and
our
savings
can
be
made
up
of
other
things
than
actual
cash
in
bank
one
item
of
our
savings
is
the
habit
of
up
our
living
beyond
our
means
does
not
incorporate
the
thought
that
in
order
to
save
every
possible
cent
we
should
become
slipshod
and
shabby
carelessness
in
dress
takes
away
from
our
rating
as
nothing
else
will
for
it
has
to
do
with
first
impressions
of
those
with
whom
we
come
in
contact
gentility
pays
dividends
of
the
highest
order
being
as
it
is
a
badge
of
character
neatness
and
it
is
just
as
cheap
in
dollars
and
cents
to
keep
ourselves
respectably
clothed
as
to
indulge
in
shoddy
apparel
under
the
delusion
that
we
have
saved
money
on
the
purchase
price
good
clothing
costing
more
at
the
start
lasts
long
looks
well
as
long
as
it
shoddy
apparel
never
is
anything
else
but
shoddy
and
well
might
it
proclaim
the
shoddy
man
when
we
throw
away
our
opportunity
to
present
a
genteel
appearance
just
for
the
sake
of
the
bank
roll
we
doom
ourselves
to
defeat
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
we
can
not
get
all
we
want
to
know
by
the
mere
reading
of
books
we
must
mingle
with
people
we
must
interchange
thought
that
we
may
crystallize
what
we
know
into
practical
knowledge
so
it
can
be
made
into
tools
to
work
with
while
a
man
of
brains
is
welcome
everywhere
the
matter
of
his
appearance
has
a
lot
to
do
with
how
he
is
received
and
with
whom
he
may
fraternize
is
it
a
pity
we
hear
people
say
that
with
all
his
brains
he
has
sense
enough
to
make
himself
presentable
but
the
worst
phase
of
the
situation
is
that
the
unkempt
man
sooner
or
later
loses
faith
in
himself
and
either
ceases
to
hoard
at
the
expense
of
his
gentility
or
he
gives
up
his
opportunity
to
mingle
with
others
and
lapses
into
habits
consistent
with
miserly
thoughts
the
phrase
happy
is
well
known
and
decidedly
applicable
to
the
subject
of
saving
as
we
go
along
so
that
we
may
avert
the
sorrows
which
follow
in
the
wake
of
beyond
our
it
suggests
a
desirable
middle
course
which
permits
us
to
adopt
a
sane
policy
rather
than
flying
to
an
extreme
it
can
not
be
said
that
we
are
living
beyond
our
means
when
by
reason
of
our
association
with
men
of
affairs
we
need
to
spend
more
money
and
thereby
save
less
in
preparing
ourselves
for
the
larger
opportunities
which
will
naturally
follow
young
men
often
go
through
college
on
their
uppers
so
to
speak
there
is
not
a
cent
which
they
could
honestly
save
as
they
went
along
without
cheating
themselves
the
point
is
that
their
situations
in
life
force
them
to
spend
rather
than
to
save
money
but
in
so
doing
the
real
saving
was
in
the
spending
thereof
enlarged
their
knowledge
and
decreased
their
bank
accounts
for
the
time
what
man
parts
with
in
an
emergency
is
no
license
however
for
him
to
fall
back
into
profligacy
never
should
a
man
entirely
lose
the
idea
of
putting
something
by
the
college
boy
in
this
case
has
simply
invested
his
money
in
an
education
instead
of
a
bank
account
once
on
the
highroad
of
life
with
a
plan
of
action
well
defined
and
a
regular
income
habit
of
putting
money
away
should
become
a
fixed
in
no
other
way
do
we
accumulate
except
by
investment
and
investment
means
putting
away
money
at
interest
or
in
some
project
which
promises
better
returns
if
we
were
to
interview
a
thousand
men
on
the
subject
of
saving
and
draw
upon
their
experiences
we
would
find
that
by
investing
money
at
interest
we
pursue
the
safest
course
far
safer
in
fact
than
the
seeking
of
outside
investments
that
greater
returns
the
latter
invites
the
mind
away
from
the
regular
avocation
and
educates
it
in
time
to
that
are
likely
to
turn
into
the
mind
instead
of
applying
itself
to
the
duty
of
making
the
most
out
of
its
regular
employment
allows
its
interest
to
become
scattered
over
too
broad
a
field
it
is
not
within
the
province
of
all
men
to
become
wealthy
and
after
all
wealth
is
not
the
only
desideratum
the
happiest
of
mortals
are
found
in
the
middle
walks
of
life
and
not
in
the
extremes
the
struggle
should
be
to
escape
the
life
which
saps
our
strength
keeps
our
nerves
on
edge
and
drives
us
away
from
the
chapter
xv
initiative
and
the
late
elbert
hubbard
defined
the
man
with
initiative
as
the
one
who
did
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
without
being
told
at
this
point
it
may
be
definitely
stated
that
such
a
man
would
naturally
be
such
a
man
would
not
lean
on
his
friends
he
would
with
them
he
would
be
found
fighting
his
own
battles
without
crying
for
help
once
a
cub
reporter
was
ordered
by
his
city
editor
to
go
and
interview
a
certain
man
after
an
awkward
pause
the
youngster
inquired
where
can
i
find
him
smiling
scornfully
into
his
eyes
the
city
editor
replied
wherever
he
is
this
would
seem
to
have
been
the
start
and
finish
of
this
newspaper
career
but
quite
the
reverse
was
true
he
took
the
lesson
well
to
heart
thus
starting
himself
on
the
road
to
if
he
had
repeated
the
offense
it
is
likely
he
would
have
lost
his
job
and
also
thereby
spoiling
his
chances
for
a
successful
career
the
fact
that
he
did
not
but
went
on
and
made
of
himself
a
famous
newspaper
man
proves
that
he
lost
no
time
in
developing
and
there
is
no
questioning
the
vast
importance
these
two
words
mean
to
all
of
us
many
a
man
who
did
not
grasp
the
significance
of
initiative
became
a
for
the
rest
of
his
life
many
a
man
also
missed
his
chances
by
doing
as
he
was
and
nothing
more
his
work
ended
there
in
due
course
it
is
inevitable
that
such
a
man
should
become
part
of
the
great
army
of
discontented
who
help
to
block
the
pavements
in
front
of
the
loafing
places
hesitation
vacillation
and
growing
diffidence
take
the
place
of
he
falls
to
the
bottom
like
a
stone
and
there
he
rests
a
drag
anchor
in
the
mire
his
job
gets
the
best
of
him
because
he
lacks
initiative
once
stranded
he
becomes
an
arrant
coward
of
his
own
illustration
scene
from
in
again
out
again
we
must
our
own
otherwise
we
are
children
of
circumstance
what
becomes
of
us
is
a
matter
of
guesswork
we
have
no
hand
in
compelling
our
own
future
is
a
species
of
it
causes
a
man
courage
to
ooze
out
at
his
toes
faster
than
it
comes
into
his
heart
men
often
have
big
ideas
but
having
no
confidence
in
themselves
they
lack
the
power
to
compel
confidence
in
when
they
go
into
the
presence
of
a
man
of
personality
they
lose
their
and
all
of
the
courage
which
drove
them
forward
flies
out
at
the
window
their
weakness
multiplies
with
each
failure
until
finally
the
jig
is
up
impotency
is
very
largely
those
who
have
big
ideas
to
present
expect
to
be
taken
in
on
them
and
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
succeed
along
with
their
scheme
when
a
man
becomes
so
unfortunate
as
to
be
unable
through
diffidence
to
explain
himself
his
big
idea
goes
into
the
waste
basket
and
with
it
all
of
the
hopes
he
has
built
upon
it
nail
has
been
driven
into
his
casket
of
to
such
a
man
all
pity
but
we
will
not
allow
him
to
escape
until
we
have
given
him
a
pat
on
the
back
and
pointed
out
the
right
road
to
travel
we
must
preach
to
him
or
undertake
to
force
him
to
do
anything
but
we
will
at
least
give
him
a
helping
hand
and
show
him
that
there
is
royal
road
to
his
this
man
needs
first
of
all
to
build
upon
his
physique
perhaps
he
has
a
and
likewise
exercise
regular
exercise
should
be
the
first
thing
on
his
program
fresh
air
long
walks
deep
breathing
dumb
bells
boxing
rowing
skating
in
season
wholesome
companionship
day
by
in
the
long
run
boxing
will
become
his
most
efficient
exercise
when
a
man
can
take
a
blow
between
the
eyes
and
come
back
for
more
he
has
begun
to
his
own
that
is
what
he
needs
in
life
battles
the
nerve
to
back
for
after
a
slam
on
the
jaw
that
would
lay
another
man
low
and
when
it
all
said
and
done
and
the
exercise
game
has
become
a
feature
of
his
work
he
must
settle
down
to
plain
food
and
plenty
of
there
is
nothing
in
all
the
world
like
these
things
combined
for
the
upbuilding
and
upholding
of
health
and
courage
our
success
is
a
matter
of
our
courage
a
man
who
can
steel
himself
to
be
knocked
down
and
get
up
immediately
afterwards
and
hand
the
other
fellow
a
ripping
punch
has
added
to
his
own
pep
courage
is
of
the
same
cloth
whether
physical
moral
or
to
build
upon
one
is
to
build
up
the
others
the
human
system
being
constructed
on
such
a
basis
that
if
one
part
is
affected
all
the
rest
follow
suit
a
man
who
is
afraid
of
a
physical
combat
will
readily
match
his
wits
with
his
fellow
man
physical
training
is
therefore
all
important
to
and
our
natural
aim
is
to
make
for
ourselves
a
true
personality
that
does
not
know
defeat
when
we
come
to
an
obstacle
we
must
be
able
to
hurdle
it
it
is
all
very
well
to
say
that
the
longest
way
around
is
the
shortest
way
across
but
it
does
sound
like
initiative
and
there
is
one
thing
about
men
who
rely
upon
themselves
they
make
no
excuses
nor
do
they
puff
up
over
victory
posing
for
applause
is
as
distasteful
to
them
as
standing
for
abuse
all
they
ask
is
a
square
deal
and
the
confidence
of
their
associates
if
they
fall
down
on
a
proposition
they
get
up
and
go
at
it
again
until
success
crowns
their
efforts
such
men
have
a
way
of
defeat
into
how
immeasurably
inferior
to
such
a
spirit
is
the
fellow
who
whines
and
moans
at
every
evil
twist
of
fortune
he
has
no
confidence
in
himself
and
nothing
else
to
do
except
confide
his
woes
to
all
who
will
listen
to
his
cowardly
story
of
defeat
such
men
are
least
useful
in
the
important
work
of
this
world
they
are
the
humdrum
hirelings
the
dumb
followers
the
pitiful
part
of
it
all
is
that
they
could
have
succeeded
had
they
but
taken
stock
of
themselves
when
the
taking
was
good
but
while
there
is
life
there
is
hope
likewise
a
chance
is
up
to
one
of
the
startling
things
about
men
of
initiative
is
the
way
they
come
forward
in
times
of
trouble
we
do
have
to
point
to
andrew
jackson
in
the
war
of
we
can
look
around
us
take
for
example
a
great
fire
have
we
often
read
of
the
brave
fireman
who
sprang
forward
and
by
doing
the
right
thing
instantly
saved
a
multitude
of
lives
well
such
a
man
is
possessed
of
he
is
trained
for
the
hazardous
life
he
leads
when
the
emergency
arose
he
was
ready
in
a
jiffy
to
do
the
work
expected
of
him
it
is
safe
to
say
that
without
training
such
men
would
have
botched
the
job
and
instead
of
being
praised
to
the
skies
would
have
sunk
into
oblivion
under
the
heap
of
public
scorn
sometimes
it
happens
that
a
man
accidentally
becomes
a
hero
but
it
was
no
accident
that
he
was
to
become
he
must
have
had
initiative
he
must
have
had
archibald
butt
was
such
a
man
he
went
down
on
the
the
last
act
of
his
life
was
to
help
women
and
children
into
the
boats
and
calm
their
minds
as
they
were
lowered
away
astor
was
of
the
same
metal
sublimely
oblivious
to
the
terrible
fate
which
hung
over
here
was
initiative
and
in
its
highest
form
and
this
sort
of
man
is
everywhere
the
car
in
which
we
ride
to
work
every
morning
contains
one
or
more
of
them
let
something
happen
and
we
will
see
them
spring
forward
with
a
line
of
action
already
formed
at
their
word
of
command
we
automatically
obey
and
then
when
the
worst
is
over
a
kindly
voice
reassures
us
and
we
go
on
our
way
rejoicing
what
would
the
world
do
without
these
men
history
is
filled
with
the
tales
of
heroes
and
heroines
and
for
every
joan
of
arc
there
are
thousands
upon
thousands
who
have
done
heroic
things
without
a
word
of
praise
moreover
the
really
brave
soul
declines
all
ovation
no
real
hero
claims
reward
have
done
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
is
reward
in
this
quality
of
and
is
not
confined
to
any
race
of
people
but
in
nations
where
personal
liberty
survives
initiative
is
at
its
best
somehow
whenever
the
emergency
man
comes
forth
to
do
and
the
great
world
war
still
raging
as
these
lines
are
penned
has
furnished
untold
thousands
of
examples
of
courageous
action
to
last
until
the
end
of
human
affairs
but
they
will
go
on
and
on
in
multiplied
form
each
day
score
superseding
those
of
the
day
before
it
would
be
bully
to
know
that
we
are
doing
our
share
in
the
of
initiative
and
needed
in
this
world
we
must
keep
moving
the
fellow
who
gets
in
a
rut
through
lack
of
initiative
finds
that
with
advancing
years
it
becomes
harder
and
harder
to
get
out
of
it
so
that
the
best
plan
is
to
make
the
move
now
while
there
is
time
to
succeed
when
we
come
to
think
of
it
there
are
plenty

failure
to
seize
opportunities
there
is
an
old
saying
to
the
effect
that
opportunity
knocks
but
once
at
our
door
and
that
is
all
de
opportunity
knocks
at
some
people
doors
nearly
every
day
of
their
lives
and
is
given
a
royal
welcome
that
what
opportunity
likes
it
goes
often
to
the
home
where
the
latchstring
hangs
on
the
outside
it
like
a
sign
reading
hot
coffee
at
all
hours
day
or
night
very
inviting
very
much
different
however
from
the
abode
whose
windows
shed
no
light
and
whose
door
barred
from
nobody
home
that
the
sign
for
this
door
mister
numbskull
lives
here
and
most
of
the
time
when
anyone
knocks
on
his
door
he
pulls
the
covers
up
over
his
head
to
shut
out
the
noise
he
down
on
his
luck
anyhow
therefore
it
would
be
a
waste
of
good
shoe
leather
for
him
to
be
up
and
puttering
around
if
opportunity
ever
knocked
at
his
door
he
could
say
in
all
truth
that
never
heard
he
had
often
heard
of
opportunity
being
in
the
neighborhood
but
one
thing
is
certain
else
had
invariably
seen
him
he
felt
sure
he
would
know
opportunity
if
ever
he
met
him
face
to
face
and
if
ever
he
did
he
would
have
it
out
with
him
then
and
there
meanwhile
dadgast
the
luck
always
the
fates
pursued
him
with
some
sort
of
hoodoo
and
his
neighbors
well
some
of
them
had
sense
enough
to
keep
their
distance
and
let
him
alone
others
however
had
not
been
considerate
of
the
fact
that
a
jinx
was
on
his
trail
and
were
given
to
making
sarcastic
remarks
concerning
him
and
thus
it
was
that
mister
numbskull
spent
his
days
dodging
his
neighbors
sidestepping
the
highways
and
obscuring
himself
from
the
very
individual
he
wanted
so
much
to
behold
at
last
there
came
a
time
when
in
despair
in
he
took
to
the
woods
and
is
yet
to
be
heard
from
opportunity
still
visits
the
neighborhood
but
the
path
leading
to
mister
numbskull
home
is
grown
up
in
weeds
the
fact
is
that
our
real
opportunity
from
through
experience
built
upon
consecutively
by
continuous
effort
our
vision
expands
and
pounds
its
way
out
through
the
portals
of
our
brain
we
see
the
thing
that
we
ought
to
do
and
go
to
to
the
man
who
see
it
opportunity
did
not
what
we
do
know
does
hurt
us
any
so
runs
the
old
saw
and
here
a
case
where
we
who
did
see
hurt
but
we
did
know
it
for
those
of
us
who
have
vision
there
are
all
sorts
of
opportunities
but
many
of
them
are
not
good
for
us
the
ones
we
make
for
ourselves
are
the
healthy
ones
and
generally
they
are
the
best
for
us
our
own
baby
is
the
one
we
will
take
the
greatest
pride
in
and
enjoy
the
most
then
we
become
masters
of
our
own
destiny
in
a
sense
and
can
be
more
independent
through
having
no
senior
partners
in
the
enterprise
often
our
dreams
bring
forth
a
need
for
many
kinds
of
special
knowledge
and
for
these
we
go
into
the
open
market
offering
opportunity
to
many
others
in
return
for
their
assistance
thus
we
find
that
everything
we
do
is
in
relation
to
other
things
and
dependent
in
part
on
other
people
this
should
make
us
careful
and
a
wee
bit
wary
opportunities
are
widely
divergent
in
nature
through
a
stroke
of
hard
luck
one
might
have
difficulty
in
finding
employment
the
first
opportunity
might
lead
to
a
job
in
a
but
having
fortified
ourselves
by
developing
our
highest
attributes
such
as
honesty
integrity
cleanliness
of
body
and
mind
we
are
able
to
somehow
or
other
pinch
along
until
something
better
shows
itself
principles
are
not
to
be
thrown
away
upon
the
first
provocation
therefore
in
order
to
take
away
the
temptation
we
might
as
well
figure
out
that
a
great
many
employments
in
the
world
do
not
represent
and
therefore
should
not
be
considered
failure
to
seize
such
opportunities
becomes
a
virtue
in
the
same
sense
that
the
failure
to
seize
a
decent
opportunity
becomes
a
shame
often
opportunity
comes
through
meeting
men
of
affairs
who
have
power
and
wealth
at
their
command
these
are
usually
in
connection
with
enterprises
of
the
greater
magnitude
those
of
us
who
have
the
power
to
control
our
destinies
to
a
reasonable
degree
should
not
stand
back
in
our
support
of
these
if
we
have
carefully
built
up
our
initiative
preparedness
in
the
way
of
efficiency
good
health
and
the
will
to
do
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
not
aspire
to
take
a
hand
in
anything
in
which
we
are
confident
we
can
succeed
among
the
men
who
control
the
big
affairs
of
the
business
world
we
find
a
true
democracy
want
the
the
fact
that
he
appears
before
them
neatly
attired
bright
of
eye
and
ready
of
wit
will
surely
count
in
his
favor
in
other
words
we
should
live
up
to
the
opportunity
in
whatever
form
it
presents
itself
after
we
have
accepted
its
responsibilities
to
make
this
perfectly
plain
must
live
up
to

if
we
are
to
be
superintendent
of
a
coal
mine
underneath
the
ground
we
will
put
on
our
overalls
and
jumpers
but
if
we
are
to
be
manager
of
a
grand
opera
house
we
will
appear
in
our
dress
suits
the
thought
is
obvious
but
as
we
journey
along
we
find
many
of
our
fellow
mortals
neglecting
to
live
in
line
with
what
they
are
doing
we
mention
this
fact
hopeful
that
we
will
not
fail
to
seize
our
opportunities
by
setting
up
obstacles
whereby
we
may
become
non
through
lack
of
discernment
opportunity
is
within
ourselves
and
when
we
have
seized
our
rightful
share
then
we
may
look
with
pride
upon
our
endeavor

assuming
responsibilities
those
who
fear
to
assume
responsibility
necessarily
orders
from
the
punishment
fits
the
crime
perfectly
and
being
there
is
no
injustice
it
is
true
that
many
men
possessed
of
great
brain
power
play
second
fiddle
to
men
of
inferior
wisdom
from
sheer
lack
of
forcefulness
on
their
own
part
they
lack
the
full
quality
of
leadership
while
possessing
all
save
one
essential
fear

in
their
hearts
and
spreads
itself
as
a
mantle
of
gloom
over
their
souls
until
finally
they
struggle
no
more
henceforth
they
are
doomed
and
become
the
subject
of
apology

the
part
of
friends
and
relations

all
right
they
say
but
he
suffers
from
he
lacks
something
we
can
not
make
out
just
what
it
is
altogether
too
bad
for
he
is

superior
man

social
we
must
take
our
hats
off
to
those
who
have
the
goodness
of
heart
to
make
allowance
for
our
shortcomings
a
disinterested
listener
however
is
seldom
taken
into
camp
by
such
well
intended
argument
he
knows
that
friend

or
friend
brother
as
the
case
may
be
needs
some
sort
of
swift
kick
that
will
stir
his
combativeness
into
action
that
will
cause
him
to
turn
upon

for

not

at
courage
can
be
built
up
just
the
same
as
any
other
soul
quality
it
is
all
a
matter
of
early
training
as
to
which
we
start
out
with
courage
or

have
a
lot
to
do
with

constitute
the
most
logical
forces
which
tend
toward
the
overdevelopment
of

in
a
child
once
the
seed
is
thoroughly
implanted
the
growth
can
be
depended
upon
how
to
get
rid
of
it
later
is
not
so
easy
to
figure
out
had
the
child
been
born
with
a
clubfoot
these
same
parents
would
have
spent
their
last
dollar
in
an
effort
to
straighten
it
into
natural
condition
they
could
see
the
unshapely
foot
day
by
day
with
their
own
eyes
and
so
could
their
neighbors
but
the
little
brain
struggling
for
courage
with
which
to
combat
its
weakness
needs
must
battle
alone
with
chances

the
mere

this
little
one

it
stumbles

fearful
of

is
disconcerting
to

almost
trace
our

a

we
can
almost

if

illustration
in
some
years
later
when
little
son
runs
breathless
into
the
home
portal
after
being
chased
from
school
by
some
turrible
boys
we
can
hear
this
same
little
mother
as
she
storms
about
the
place
and
tells
what
papa
must
do
about
the
matter
according
to
her
notion
if
teachers
could
not
control
the
criminal
element
among
their
pupils
then
it
was
high
time
for
the
police
to
step
in
never

father
listens
in
silence
and
half
formulates
the
notion
of
going
direct
to
the
parents
and
laying
down
the
law
while
little
son
listens
in
fear
and
trembling
in
anticipation
of
what
is
coming
to
him
if
father
carries
out
his
threat
tall
oaks
from

acorns

the
twig

not

in
the
little
son
is
bound
to
grow
into
manhood
some
day
and
when
he
arrives
he
must
have
one
particular
attribute
somehow
he
will
get
along
if
he
has
that
he
may
also
wear
a
clubfoot
or
a
hunch
back
but
with
courage
as
a
running
mate
he
will
assume
his
responsibilities
and
become
a
force
in
the
world
once
a
great
orator
sat
upon
a
rostrum
listening
to
a
speech
by
a
man
who
cautioned
his
countrymen
against
taking
steps
to
defend
the
national
honor
we
outlive
the
taunts
of
those
who
would
drag
us
into
war
he
bellowed
forth
whereupon
the
orator
jumped
to
his
feet
and
with
clarion
voice
shouted
god
hates
a
coward
and
then
sat
down
again
dazed
at
first
the
vast
throng
sat
stupefied
but
only
for
a
moment
then
as
one
man
they
jumped
to
their
feet
and
by
reason
of
prolonged
cheering
gave
national
impulse
to
a
thought
which
has
since
been
sermonized
from
thousands
of
pulpits
the
orator
had
simply
paraphrased
and
put
pep
into
the
old
biblical
slogan
the
lord
helps
those
who
help
themselves
the
effect
was
electrical
the
whole
country
rallied
to
the
idea
with
the
result
that
we
saved
ourselves
from
war
by
showing
the
solid
front
of
being
ready
and
willing
to
defend
ourselves
everything
that
tends
to
build
up
courage
is
an
asset
in
life
the
more
we
have
of
it
the
further
we
go
and
the
more
interesting
our
lives
become
for
man
of
the
lion
all
things
unfold
and
unto
him
the
timid
must
bring
their
offerings
no
one
of
ordinary
gumption
consults
the
human
flivver
advice
from
him
would
be
unavailing
his
point
of
view
would
be
inadequate
his
ability
to
advise
impotent
we
go
to
the
man
who
does
things
and
say
to
him
here
is
my
little
idea
do
you
want
to
help
me
put
it
over
if
it
is
good
he
does
if
not
his
experience
tells
him
so
for
men
of
courage
are
naturally
possessed
of
large
vision
their
lack
of
fear
has
given
them
over
vast
areas
of
the
world
of
action
they
fail
only
as
their
lights
go
out
forever
with
courage
we
order
our
own
lives
and
take
orders
only
from
those
of
superior
wisdom
this
we
can
never
afford
to
the
courageous
man
of
largest
vision
commands
by
his
power
to
reason
logically
and
therefore
assumes
the
air
of
comradeship
rather
than
overseer
or
boss
only
through
lack
of
moral
and
physical
courage
are
we
to
become
the
slaves
of
these
courage
the
child
of
the
despair
of
born
of

it
links
its
fate
with

the
fears
which
spring
up
before
it

do
such
partnerships
are
sure
of
success
it
is
only
through
lack
of
comradeship
that
love
flies
out
of
the
window
lights
on
a
the
marriage
state
is
a
long
contract
it
should
not
be
stumbled
into
by
man
or
woman
nor
should
we
become
cowardly
to
the
point
of
backing
out
of
it
altogether
love
is
blind
to
the
either
party
to
the
tie
that
binds
has
a
chance
to
know
in
advance
whether
the
venture
is
safe
and
sane
all
a
man
has
to
consider
after
he
knows
his
own
heart
is
that
the
woman
of
his
choice
is
sensible
considerate
and
healthy
other
things
being
equal
he
can
take
the
leap
without
hesitancy
we
borrow
trouble
illustration
the
monk
and
the
to
a
body
of
of
course
there
are
those
who
never
they
do
however
and
when
they
do
they
loan
themselves
to
the
mockery
of
the
marriage
state
there
is
no
time
to
dwell
on
this
thought
for
it
is
just
something
that
goes
on
happening
anyway
and
has
no
bearing
upon
the
advisability
of
wedlock
in
time
between
of
horse
given
a
good
wife
after
his
own
heart
no
manly
man
has
a
righteous
kick
coming
against
the
fates
under
such
circumstances
if
things
go
wrong
he
will
find
the
fault
within
himself
of
course
we
should
to
the
fullest
possible
extent
be
prepared
for
marriage
before
assuming
its
responsibilities
we
should
at
least
have
a
ticket
before
embarking
and
it
is
the
man
duty
to
provide
the
ticket
since
it
is
to
be
a
long
voyage
a
round
trip
is
necessary
in
other
words
a
man
need
be
rich
when
he
marries
but
he
should
not
be
broke
either
lack
of
funds
a
few
days
after
the
honeymoon
is
too
hard
a
test
for
matrimony
to
bear
nobly
it
is
too
much
like
inviting
a
catastrophe
through
lack
of
good
hard
sense
to
begin
with
it
shows
poor
generalship
at
the
very
start
and
there
is
the
liability
of
causing
great
distress
and
hardship
to
a
little
woman
it
would
be
a
sad
blow
to
her
to
find
that
the
man
of
her
choice
was
after
all
just
an
ordinary
fellow
man
without
there
are
four
seasons
in
married
life
spring
summer
fall
and
winter
and
we
are
going
to
need
a
comrade
as
we
go
through
each
of
them
and
the
one
we
want
the
one
we
start
the
gentle
partner
in
all
our
joys
and
sorrows
it
is
she
who
will
stand
back
of
us
when
all
others
fail
when
the
children
come
along
to
bless
our
days
and
inspire
us
to
greater
efforts
we
are
glad
to
look
into
their
happy
smiling
faces
and
find
that
they
resemble
their
mother
their
soft
cheeks
are
like
hers
their
hands
their
dainty
ways
their
caresses
and
when
mama
looks
into
those
same
bright
eyes
they
make
her
think
of
their
daddy
the
fond
affection
bestowed
upon
the
children
by
both
parents
is
but
another
mode
of
expressing
their
regard
for
each
other
springtime
days
these
when
little
tots
climb
up
and
entwine
their
arms
about
our
necks
if
this
were
married
life
only
compensation
it
would
not
prove
in
vain
for
when
the
babies
enter
the
home
the
tie
that
binds
becomes
hard
and
fast
the
man
is
a
manly
to
become
the
father
of
a
babe
is
an
experience
of
the
highest
importance
to
a
young
man
getting
started
it
reinforces
his
courage
doubles
up
his
ambitions
and
him
on
his
he
has
a
new
responsibility
and
it
adds
to
his
strength
of
character
to
assume
it
in
all
its
phases
another
thing
it
brings
comfort
and
joy
to
the
mother
during
the
long
days
while
her
man
is
out
in
the
fray
drives
ennui
out
of
the
household
throughout
our
springtime
and
when
summer
comes
along
new
hopes
dawn
within
us
springtime
had
found
us
up
and
doing
and
when
it
merged
into
the
new
season
we
found
our
aspirations
even
stronger
than
before
children
must
be
educated
and
their
futures
prepared
in
advance
as
far
as
may
be
they
must
not
go
into
the
world
tools
to
work
meanwhile
the
household
teems
with
plans
and
becomes
a
veritable
dreamland
of
youthful
fervor
we
find
that
having
helped
our
children
into
attractive
personalities
they
have
become
magnets
with
which
to
draw
about
us
their
comrades
thus
we
hold
on
to
our
youth
by
virtue
of
our
surroundings
creatures
of
our
thoughtfulness
concerning
in
that
the
fall
season
is
coming
has
no
terrors
for
us
there
will
be
the
weddings
and
plannings
for
new
homes
if
we
have
our
say
and
in
due
course
the
grandchildren
will
come
who
will
favor
grandpa
and
grandma
and
once
again
youth
knocks
at
our
door
there
will
be
no
dread
winter
days
for
us
for
we
have
been
forehanded
we
have
a
crew
on
board
to
chase
away
the
cares
of
old
age
and
try
how
we
will
there
is
no
way
to
forestall
the
operation
of
the
law
of
compensation
we
reap
as
we
sow
the
world
will
be
good
to
those
who
compel
its
respect
by
becoming
the
right
sort
of
citizens
in
time
that
the
chapter
xix
laugh
and
live
again
i
find
it
expedient
to
resort
to
the
personal
pronoun
and
therefore
this
final
chapter
is
to
be
devoted
to
and
there
are
facts
you
may
want
to
know
and
one
of
them
is
whether
or
not
i
live
up
to
my
own
prescription
i
do
it
i
have
kept
myself
happy
and
well
through
keeping
my
physical
department
in
first
class
order
if
that
had
been
left
to
take
care
of
itself
i
would
surely
have
fallen
by
the
wayside
in
other
departments
once
we
sit
down
in
security
the
world
seems
to
us
things
we
do
not
fresh
air
is
my
intoxicant
and
it
keeps
me
in
high
spirits
my
system
does
crave
artificial
stimulation
because
daily
quickens
the
blood
sufficiently
then
too
i
manage
to
that
the
real
elixir
not
always
physical
activity
either
for
i
must
read
good
books
in
order
to
exercise
my
mind
in
other
channels
than
just
my
daily
routine
and
add
to
my
store
of
knowledge
as
well
then
there
is
my
which
must
have
attention
now
and
then
for
this
a
little
solitude
is
helpful
we
have
only
to
sense
the
phenomena
surrounding
us
to
know
that
we
must
have
a
something
to
live
by
which
automatically
keeps
us
on
our
course
the
mystery
of
life
somehow
loses
its
density
we
retain
our
spark
of
all
of
my
life
since
childhood
i
have
held
shakespeare
in
constant
companionship
aside
from
the
bible
which
is
entirely
apart
from
all
other
books
shakespeare
has
no
equal
my
father
partly
from
his
love
for
the
great
poet
and
partly
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
me
to
memorize
accurately
taught
me
to
recite
shakespeare
before
i
was
old
enough
to
know
the
meaning
of
the
words
i
remembered
them
however
and
in
later
years
i
grew
to
know
their
full
significance
then
i
became
an
ardent
follower
of
the
master
philosopher
than
whom
no
greater
interpreter
of
human
emotions
ever
lived
in
the
matter
of
sage
advice
there
has
never
been
his
equal
in
we
find
the
wonderful
words
of
admonition
from
in
his
farewell
speech
to
his
son
as
good
today
as
four
hundred
years
ago
and
they
will
continue
to
be
so
until
the
end
of
time
it
matters
not
how
familiar
we
may
be
with
these
lines
it
is
no
waste
of
time
to
read
them
over
again
once
in
awhile
they
seem
to
fit
the
side
of
perfectly
if
we
have
any
complaint
by
reason
of
their
brusqueness
we
have
only
to
temper
our
interpretation
according
to
our
own
sense
of
justice
in
other
words
if
we
wanted
to
loan
a
now
and
then
we
would
just
go
ahead
and
do
it
meanwhile
to
save
you
the
trouble
of
looking
up
these
lines
here
they
are
in
laugh
and
live
and
these
few
precepts
in
thy
memory
see
thou
charácter
give
thy
thoughts
no
tongue
nor
any
unproportioned
thought
his
act
be
thou
familiar
but
by
no
means
vulgar
the
friends
thou
hast
and
their
adoption
tried
grapple
them
to
thy
soul
with
hoops
of
steel
but
do
not
dull
thy
palm
with
entertainment
of
each
unfledged
comrade
beware
of
entrance
to
a
quarrel
but
being
in
that
the
opposed
may
beware
of
thee
give
every
man
thine
ear
but
few
thy
voice
take
each
man
censure
but
reserve
thy
judgment
costly
thy
habit
as
thy
purse
can
buy
but
not
express
in
fancy
rich
not
gaudy
for
the
apparel
oft
proclaims
the
man
and
they
in
france
of
the
best
rank
and
station
are
of
a
most
select
and
generous
sheaf
in
that
neither
a
borrower
nor
a
lender
be
for
loan
oft
loses
both
itself
and
friend
and
borrowing
dulls
the
edge
of
husbandry
this

all
thine

true
and
it
must
follow
as

night

day
thou
canst

the
time
has
come
to
close
this
little
book
it
has
been
a
great
pleasure
to
write
it
and
a
greater
pleasure
to
hope
that
it
will
be
received
in
the
same
spirit
it
has
been
written
these
are
busy
days
for
all
of
us
we
go
in
a
gallop
most
of
the
time
but
there
comes
the
quiet
hour
when
we
must
sit
still
and
take
stock
i
know
this
from
the
letters
that
come
to
me
asking
my
opinion
on
all
sorts
of
subjects
people
believe
i
am
happy
because
my
laughing
pictures
seem
to
denote
this
fact
it
is
a
in
the
foregoing
chapters
i
have
told
why
if
in
the
telling
i
shall
have
been
instrumental
in
adding
to

shall
ever

of
douglas
fairbanks
young
douglas
fairbanks
star
alike
in
both
the
speakies
and
the
movies
is
well
worth
a
story
he
is
what
every
american
might
be
ought
to
be
and
frequently
is
more
than
any
other
that
comes
to
mind
he
is
possessed
of
the
indomitable
optimism
that
gives
purpose
punch
and
color
to
any
life
no
matter
what
the
odds
he
holds
the
world
record
for
the
standing
broad
grin
there
is
a
minute
of
the
day
that
fails
to
find
him
glad
that
he
alive
nobody
ever
saw
him
with
a
grouch
or
suffering
from
an
attack
of
the
blues
nobody
ever
heard
him
mention
hard
luck
in
connection
with
one
of
his
failures
the
worse
the
breaks
of
the
game
the
gloomier
the
outlook
the
wider
his
grin
he
has
made
cheerfulness
a
habit
and
it
has
paid
him
in
courage
in
bubbling
energy
and
buoyant
resolve
we
are
a
young
nation
and
a
great
nation
judging
from
the
promise
of
the
morning
there
is
nothing
that
may
not
be
asked
of
america
noon
a
land
of
abundance
with
not
an
evil
that
may
not
be
banished
and
yet
there
is
more
whining
in
it
than
in
any
other
country
on
the
face
of
the
globe
if
we
are
to
die
nibbled
to
death
by
ducks
may
well
be
put
on
the
tombstone
little
things
are
permitted
to
bring
about
paroxysms
of
peevishness
even
our
pleasures
have
come
to
be
taken
sadly
we
are
irritable
at
picnics
snarly
at
clambakes
and
bored
to
death
at
dinners
the
government
ought
to
hire
douglas
fairbanks
and
send
him
over
the
country
as
an
agent
of
the
bureau
of
grins
have
him
start
work
in
boston
and
then
rush
him
by
special
train
to
philadelphia
if
the
wealth
of
the
united
states
increased
during
the
last
three
peevish
whining
years
think
what
would
happen
if
we
learned
the
art
of
joyousness
and
gained
the
strength
that
comes
from
good
humor
and
optimism
doug
fairbanks
now
that
he
is
in
the
movies
we
do
have
to
be
formal
is
the
living
breathing
proof
of
the
value
of
a
grin
his
rise
from
obscurity
to
fame
from
poverty
to
wealth
has
no
larger
foundation
than
his
willingness
to
let
the
whole
world
see
every
tooth
in
his
head
good
looks
artistry
bosh
the
fairbanks
features
were
evidently
picked
out
by
a
utilitarian
mother
who
preferred
use
to
ornament
and
as
for
his
acting
critics
of
the
drama
imbued
with
the
traditions
of
booth
and
barrett
have
been
known
to
sob
like
children
after
witnessing
a
fairbanks
performance
it
is
the
joyousness
of
the
man
that
gets
him
over
it
the
per
cent
interest
that
he
takes
in
everything
he
goes
at
that
lies
at
the
back
of
his
success
he
does
nothing
by
halves
is
never
indifferent
never
lackadaisical
at
various
stages
in
his
brief
career
he
has
been
a
shakespearean
actor
wall
street
clerk
hay
steward
on
a
vagabond
and
business
man
knowing
poverty
hunger
and
discomfort
at
times
but
never
losing
the
grin
things
began
to
move
for
him
when
he
left
a
denver
high
school
back
in
for
the
purpose
of
entering
college
as
he
says
a
man
ca
be
too
careful
about
college
he
started
for
princeton
but
met
a
youth
on
the
train
who
was
going
to
harvard
he
took
a
special
course
at
cambridge
just
what
it
was
he
ca
remember
but
at
the
end
of
the
year
it
was
hinted
to
him
that
circus
life
was
more
suited
to
his
talents
particularly
one
with
three
rings
a
friend
however
suggested
the
theatre
and
gave
him
a
card
to
frederick
warde
the
tragedian
warde
fell
for
the
fairbanks
grin
and
as
a
first
part
assigned
him
the
role
of
the
lackey
in
richelieu
what
he
lacked
in
experience
he
made
up
for
in
activity
and
unflagging
merriment
it
got
to
be
so
that
warde
was
almost
afraid
to
touch
the
bell
for
he
never
knew
whether
the
amazing
would
enter
through
the
door
or
come
down
from
the
ceiling
after
the
company
had
done
its
worst
to
richelieu
it
changed
to
shakespearean
repertoire
and
for
one
year
young
fairbanks
engaged
in
what
warde
was
pleased
to
term
a
bout
with
the
immortal
bard
when
friends
of
shakespeare
finally
protested
in
the
name
of
humanity
the
strenuous
douglas
accepted
an
engagement
with
herbert
kelcey
and
effie
shannon
in
her
lord
and
master
five
months
went
by
before
the
two
stars
broke
under
the
strain
and
by
that
time
news
had
come
to
fairbanks
that
wall
street
was
easy
money
other
name
armed
with
his
grin
he
marched
into
the
office
of
de
coppet
doremus
and
when
the
manager
came
out
of
his
trance
shakespeare
worst
enemy
was
holding
down
the
job
of
order
man
the
name
coppet
appealed
to
me
he
explains
he
is
still
remembered
in
that
office
fondly
but
fearfully
he
did
his
work
well
enough
in
fact
there
are
those
who
insist
that
he
invented
scientific
management
how
about
that
i
asked
him
for
it
puzzled
me
well
you
see
it
was
this
way
for
five
days
in
a
week
i
would
say
so
to
my
assistant
no
matter
what
he
suggested
on
saturday
i
would
dash
into
the
manager
office
wag
my
head
knit
my
brow
and
exclaim
we
need
around
here
is
and
once
i
urged
the
purchase
of
a
the
way
he
filled
his
spare
time
was
what
bothered
what
with
his
tumbling
tricks
boxing
wrestling
over
chairs
and
other
small
gaieties
he
mussed
up
routine
to
a
certain
extent
but
he
was
discharged
at
a
point
where
the
firm
was
just
one
jump
ahead
of
nervous
prostration
along
came
jack
beardsley
and
little
owen
two
husky
football
players
with
a
desire
to
see
life
without
the
safety
clutch
the
three
approached
the
officials
of
a
and
by
persistent
claims
to
the
effect
that
they
had
a
way
with
dumb
animals
got
jobs
as
hay
stewards
we
found
the
cows
very
nice
comments
fairbanks
no
one
can
get
me
to
say
a
word
against
them
but
those
stokers
and
those
other
pow
we
had
to
fight
from
one
end
of
the
voyage
to
the
other
and
it
got
so
that
i
bit
myself
in
my
sleep
the
three
of
us
got
eight
shillings
apiece
when
we
landed
at
liverpool
and
tickets
back
but
there
were
several
little
things
about
europe
that
bothered
us
and
we
thought
we
see
what
the
trouble
was
they
hoboed
it
through
england
france
and
belgium
working
at
any
old
job
until
they
gathered
money
enough
to
move
along
whether
it
was
carrying
water
to
english
navvies
or
unloading
from
a
seine
boat
after
three
joyous
months
they
felt
the
call
of
the
cattle
and
came
home
on
another
steamer
back
on
his
native
heath
young
fairbanks
took
a
shot
from
the
hip
at
law
but
missed
then
he
got
a
job
in
a
plant
but
one
day
he
found
that
his
carelessness
had
permitted
fifty
dollars
to
accumulate
and
he
breezed
down
to
cuba
and
yucatan
to
see
what
openings
there
were
for
capital
back
from
that
tramping
trip
he
figured
that
since
he
had
not
annoyed
the
stage
for
some
time
it
certainly
owed
him
something
his
return
to
the
drama
took
place
in
the
rose
of
plymouth
town
a
play
in
which
miss
minnie
dupree
was
the
star
meeting
miss
dupree
i
asked
her
what
sort
of
an
actor
fairbanks
was
in
those
days
well
she
said
judiciously
i
think
that
he
was
about
the
nicest
case
of
vitus
dance
that
ever
came
under
my
notice
william
brady
got
him
next
brady
is
quite
a
dynamo
himself
and
there
was
also
a
time
in
his
life
when
he
managed
james
corbett
the
two
fell
into
each
other
arms
with
a
cry
of
joy
and
for
seven
years
they
touched
off
dramatic
explosions
that
strewed
fat
actors
all
over
the
landscape
and
tore
miles
of
scenery
into
ribbons
some
boy
was
brady
tribute
put
him
in
a
death
scene
and
he
find
a
way
to
break
the
furniture
there
was
never
a
part
that
doug
fairbanks
lay
down
on
to
every
role
he
brought
joy
and
interest
and
enthusiasm
and
the
night
came
inevitably
that
saw
his
name
in
electric
letters
it
is
not
claimed
that
his
work
as
a
star
elevated
the
drama
but
it
may
safely
be
claimed
that
he
never
appeared
in
any
play
that
was
not
wholesome
stimulating
and
helpful
nothing
was
more
natural
than
that
the
movies
should
seek
such
an
actor
and
they
set
the
trap
with
attractive
bait
come
over
to
us
they
said
and
we
let
you
do
anything
you
want
outside
of
poison
gas
and
actual
murder
the
sky
the
limit
without
even
waiting
to
kick
off
his
shoes
doug
fairbanks
made
a
dive
the
movie
magnates
got
what
they
wanted
and
fairbanks
got
what
he
wanted
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
able
to
let
go
with
all
the
force
of
his
dynamic
individuality
and
he
took
full
advantage
of
the
opportunity
in
the
lamb
his
first
adventure
before
the
camera
he
let
a
rattlesnake
crawl
over
him
tackled
a
mountain
lion
a
bunch
of
yaqui
indians
until
they
bellowed
and
operated
a
in
his
picture
in
the
papers
he
was
called
upon
to
run
an
automobile
over
a
cliff
engage
in
a
grueling
go
with
a
professional
pugilist
jump
off
an
atlantic
liner
and
swim
to
the
distant
shore
mix
it
up
in
a
furious
battle
royal
with
a
half
dozen
husky
gunmen
leap
twice
from
swiftly
moving
trains
and
also
to
resist
arrest
by
a
squad
of
jess
willards
dressed
up
in
police
uniforms
the
carried
him
out
to
california
and
among
other
things
threw
him
into
the
heart
of
a
forest
fire
that
had
been
carefully
kindled
in
the
redwood
groves
of
calaveras
county
amid
a
rain
of
burning
pine
tufts
and
with
great
branches
falling
to
the
ground
all
around
him
douggie
was
required
to
dash
in
and
save
the
gallant
sheriff
from
turning
into
a
cinder
hair
and
eyelashes
grew
out
again
however
his
blisters
healed
and
in
a
few
days
he
was
as
good
as
new
the
habit
of
happiness
was
rich
in
stunts
that
would
have
made
even
battling
nelson
turn
to
tatting
with
a
sigh
of
relief
five
gangsters
sicked
on
to
their
work
by
the
villain
waylaid
our
hero
on
the
stairs
and
in
the
that
followed
it
was
his
duty
to
beat
each
and
every
one
of
them
into
a
state
of
coma
he
performed
his
task
so
conscientiously
that
his
hands
were
swollen
for
a
week
not
to
mention
his
eyes
and
nose
as
for
the
five
extra
men
who
posed
as
the
gangsters
all
came
to
the
conclusion
that
was
far
less
strenuous
than
art
and
went
back
to
their
former
jobs
the
good
bad
man
was
a
western
picture
that
contained
a
thrill
to
every
foot
of
film
our
hero
galloped
over
mountains
jumping
from
crag
to
crag
held
up
an
express
train
in
order
to
capture
the
conductor
grappled
with
gigantic
desperadoes
every
few
minutes
shot
up
a
saloon
and
was
dragged
around
for
quite
a
while
at
the
end
of
a
lynching
party
rope

was
one
joyous
round
of

behind

job
as

so
as
to
be

aside
from

regular
duties
he
is
required
to
work
overtime
on
account
of
the
hatred
of
a
who
also
loves
the
girl
five
scoundrels
jump
and
after
manhandling
four
he
drops
from
a
window
to
the
neck
of
the
fifth
and
chokes
him
with
hands
and
legs
after
which
he
carries
the
senseless
wretch
down
the
street
and
gaily
flicks
him
as
it
were
through
a
window
at
the
villain
feet
as
a
tasty
little
finish
and
his
rival
lock
themselves
in
an
empty
room
and
engage
in
a
contest
governed
by
rules
three
days
after
the
combat
by
the
way
the
company
heads
were
pleased
to
announce
that
both
men
were
out
of
danger
unless
set
in
illustration
hoping
the
mystery
of
the
leaping
fish
was
what
is
known
as
a
water
picture
and
doug
as
a
comedy
detective
was
compelled
to
make
a
human
submarine
of
himself
not
to
mention
several
duels
in
the
dark
with
japanese
thugs
and
opium
smugglers
another
day
of
it
he
grinned
and
i
have
grown
fins
manhattan
madness
was
really
nothing
more
than
vitus
dance
set
to
ragtime
our
hero
climbed
up
plunged
through
down
into
dungeons
jumped
from
the
roof
of
a
house
into
a
tree
kicked
his
way
in
and
out
of
secret
closets
and
engaged
in
combats
with
desperate
villains
every
few
minutes
it
is
not
only
the
case
that
doug
fairbanks
made
good
with
the
movie
fans
what
is
more
to
the
point
he
made
good
with
the
bunch
itself
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
the
legitimate
star
going
over
into
pictures
evades
and
avoids
the
rough
stuff
to
some
humble
hardy
double
is
assigned
the
actual
work
of
falling
off
the
cliff
riding
at
full
speed
across
granite
hedges
taking
a
good
hard
punch
in
the
nose
or
plunging
from
the
top
of
the
burning
building
many
an
honest
cowpuncher
taking
his
girl
to
the
show
with
him
to
let
her
see
what
a
daredevil
he
is
has
died
the
death
upon
discovering
that
he
was
merely
doubling
for
some
hero
who
lacked
the
nerve
to
do
the
stunt
himself
doug
fairbanks
is
one
of
the
few
movie
heroes
who
have
never
had
a
double
he
asks
no
man
to
do
that
which
he
is
afraid
to
do
himself
no
fall
is
too
hard
for
him
no
fight
too
furious
no
ride
too
dangerous
there
is
not
a
single
one
of
his
pictures
in
which
he
has
taken
a
chance
of
breaking
his
neck
or
his
bones
but
as
one
observed
he
jes
licks
his
lips
an
asks
for
more
to
be
sure
few
actors
have
brought
such
equipment
to
the
strenuous
work
of
the
movies
fairbanks
in
addition
to
being
blessed
with
a
strong
lithe
body
has
developed
it
by
expert
devotion
to
every
form
of
athletic
sport
he
swims
well
is
a
crack
boxer
a
good
polo
player
a
splendid
wrestler
a
skilful
acrobat
a
fast
runner
and
an
absolutely
fearless
rider
there
is
never
a
picture
during
the
progress
of
which
he
does
not
interpolate
some
sudden
bit
of
business
as
the
result
of
his
quick
wit
and
dynamic
enthusiasm
in
one
play
for
instance
he
was
supposed
to
enter
a
house
at
sight
of
his
sweetheart
beckoning
to
him
from
an
upper
window
as
he
passed
up
the
steps
however
his
roving
eye
caught
sight
of
the
porch
railing
a
and
a
balcony
and
in
a
flash
he
was
scaling
the
facade
of
the
house
like
any
cat
in
another
play
he
was
trapped
on
the
roof
of
a
country
home
suddenly
fairbanks
disregarding
the
plan
of
retreat
indicated
by
the
author
gave
a
wild
leap
into
a
maple
managed
to
catch
a
bough
and
proceeded
to
the
ground
in
a
series
of
convulsive
falls
that
gave
the
director
during
the
picture
some
of
the
action
took
place
about
a
fallen
redwood
that
had
its
great
roots
fully
twenty
feet
into
the
air
climb
up
on
top
of
those
roots
doug
yelled
the
director
instead
of
that
douggie
went
up
to
a
young
sapling
that
grew
at
the
base
of
the
fallen
tree
bending
it
down
to
the
ground
as
an
archer
bends
his
bow
he
gave
a
sudden
spring
and
let
the
tough
birch
catapult
him
to
the
highest
root
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
now
he
grinned
come
back
the
same
way
grinned
the
director
most
legitimate
actors
the
valuation
is
their
own
find
the
movies
rather
dull
time
hangs
very
heavily
upon
their
hands
as
one
remarked
to
me
in
tones
that
were
thick
with
a
divine
despair
absolutely
nothing
for
a
chap
to
do
in
lots
of
the
holes
they
drag
you
to
there
is
even
a
hotel
no
companionship
no
diversion
of
any
kind
and
oftentimes
no
bathtubs
douglas
fairbanks
enters
no
such
complaint
he
draws
upon
the
energy
and
interest
that
ought
to
be
in
every
human
being
and
when
entertainment
is
not
in
sight
he
goes
after
it
when
they
were
making
the
pictures
in
the
carquinez
woods
of
northern
california
he
was
never
seen
around
the
camp
except
when
actually
needed
by
the
camera
man
upon
his
return
from
these
absences
it
was
noticed
that
his
hands
were
usually
bleeding
and
his
clothing
stained
and
torn
what
in
the
name
of
mischief
have
you
been
doing
now
the
director
demanded
on
a
day
when
fairbanks
wardrobe
was
almost
a
total
loss
trappin
chirped
the
star
beating
about
the
woods
bret
harte
in
hand
he
had
managed
to
discover
an
old
woodsman
who
still
held
to
the
ancient
industries
of
his
youth
the
trapper
specialty
was
bob
cats
and
the
bleeding
hands
and
torn
clothes
came
from
doug
earnest
efforts
to
handle
the
varmints
just
as
his
venerable
preceptor
handled
them
out
of
the
experience
at
least
he
brought
an
intimate
knowledge
of
field
forest
and
stream
for
over
the
fire
and
in
their
walks
he
had
pumped
the
old
man
dry
in
the
same
way
he
made
the
good
bad
man
hand
him
over
everything
of
value
that
frontier
life
contained
the
picture
was
taken
out
in
the
mohave
desert
for
the
making
of
it
the
director
had
scoured
the
west
for
riders
and
ropers
and
cowboys
of
the
old
school
he
men
every
one
of
them
and
for
a
time
they
looked
with
dislike
and
suspicion
upon
the
star
but
when
they
saw
that
fairbanks
did
not
ask
for
any
double
and
took
the
hardest
tumble
with
a
grin
they
received
him
into
their
fellowship
with
a
heartfelt
yell
dull
in
the
mohave
desert
why
he
had
to
sit
up
nights
to
keep
even
with
his
engagements
from
one
man
he
learned
from
another
fancy
roping
and
from
others
all
that
there
is
to
know
about
horses
cattle
mountain
and
plain
and
around
the
he
got
stories
of
the
winning
of
the
west
such
as
never
found
their
way
into
histories
when
one
picture
called
for
work
he
did
rest
satisfied
with
learning
just
enough
to
get
by
every
spare
moment
found
him
in
a
clinch
with
the
japanese
expert
mastering
every
secret
perfecting
himself
in
every
hold
same
way
with
boxing
when
no
pugilists
came
handy
he
put
on
the
gloves
with
anyone
willing
to
take
chances
on
a
black
eye
keeping
at
it
until
today
they
have
to
hire
professionals
when
he
figures
in
a
movie
fight
when
they
made
a
water
picture
he
never
stopped
until
he
could
duplicate
every
trick
known
to
the
professor
who
drilled
the
extra
men
he
took
advantage
of
a
biplane
flight
to
make
friends
with
the
aeronaut
and
by
the
time
the
picture
was
done
he
was
as
good
a
driver
as
the
expert
no
matter
where
he
is
or
what
the
job
he
finds
something
of
interest
because
he
goes
upon
the
theory
that
every
minute
is
meant
to
be
lived
maroon
him
at
a
with
five
hours
until
train
time
and
have
the
operator
first
name
in
ten
minutes
and
be
learning
the
morse
alphabet
after
which
he
would
rush
up
to
his
new
friend
house
to
see
the
babies
or
to
pass
judgment
on
a
holstein
calf
or
a
black
minorca
brood
it
is
the
tremendously
human
quality
more
than
anything
else
that
gets
him
across
people
like
him
because
he
likes
them
he
attracts
interest
because
he
takes
interest
talk
with
any
of
the
big
men
in
the
industry
that
is
those
with
brains
and
education
and
they
will
tell
you
that
personality
counts
more
in
pictures
than
it
does
on
the
stage
aitken
president
of
the
triangle
film
corporation
said
to
me
the
screen
is
intimate
the
camera
brings
the
actor
right
into
your
lap
in
the
speaking
drama
and
footlights
change
and
hide
but
not
the
least
flicker
of
expression
is
lost
in
the
picture
it
a
test
of
and
it
takes
a
real
man
or
a
real
woman
to
stand
it
art
is
the
thing
at
all
nor
do
looks
count
for
half
as
much
as
people
suppose
it
what
back
of
the
art
and
the
looks
that
makes
the
hit
and
if
they
have
got
the
artist
and
the
beauty
last
long
we
picked
douglas
fairbanks
as
a
likely
film
star
not
on
account
of
his
stunts
as
the
majority
think
but
because
of
the
splendid
humanness
that
fairly
oozed
out
of
him
illustration
a
lumiere
when
he
is
before
the
camera
or
fooling
with
an
airship
or
a
motor
or
playing
with
children
or
gettin
acquainted
with
a
tramp
or
a
trapper
or
practising
stunts
with
a
rope
or
a
horse
young
fairbanks
fills
in
his
spare
time
writing
scenarios
as
everyone
knows
the
drama
has
been
a
tawdry
thing
for
the
most
part
either
a
rehash
of
old
stage
plays
novels
and
short
stories
or
else
mediocre
originalities
that
epitomized
banality
young
fairbanks
dissented
from
the
established
custom
from
the
very
start
it
all
wrong
he
declared
we
got
to
stand
on
our
own
feet
develop
your
own
dramatists
practically
every
play
in
which
he
has
appeared
sprang
from
his
personal
suggestion
and
in
many
of
them
he
has
collaborated
with
the
scenario
writer
the
three
things
that
he
demands
are
action
wholesomeness
and
sentiment
that
rings
true
never
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
that
douglas
fairbanks
starts
and
finishes
with
mere
good
humor
and
physical
exuberance
there
is
more
to
him
than
his
grin
for
his
mind
is
as
strong
and
vigorous
as
his
body
he
reads
and
thinks
and
behind
his
smile
is
a
quick
and
eager
sympathy
that
takes
account
of
the
sadnesses
of
life
as
well
as
its
promises
the
habit
of
happiness
was
very
much
his
own
idea
and
in
it
he
took
occasion
to
show
a
midnight
the
misery
of
the
slums
and
various
forms
of
social
injustice
it
is
that
he
thinks
himself
called
to
uplift
and
reform
but
as
he
expresses
it
every
little
bit
helps
in
the
last
talk
that
i
had
with
him
he
was
enthusiastic
over
the
future
of
the
movies
as
a
world
force
he
speaks
in
ideas
rather
than
words
for
when
he
feels
that
he
has
indicated
the
thought
he
never
troubles
to
finish
the
particular
sentence
pictures
are
like
music
he
declared
they
speak
a
universal
language
great
industry
just
in
its
infancy
before
long
films
will
pass
from
one
country
to
another
internationalism
why
not
love
hate
grief
ambition
laughter
they
belong
to
one
race
as
much
as
another
all
peoples
understand
them
it
hard
to
hate
people
after
you
know
them
pictures
will
let
us
know
each
other
they
break
down
the
hard
national
lines
that
now
make
for
war
and
suspicion
other
things
followed
for
we
discussed
everything
from
cabbages
to
kings
and
then
i
plumped
the
question
at
him
that
i
had
been
waiting
to
ask
from
the
first
how
do
you
like
the
movies
as
compared
to
the
speaking
drama
come
now
cross
your
heart
and
hope
to
die
when
the
night
comes
down
and
the
lights
go
up
is
there
a
blue
minute
now
and
then
surest
thing
you
know
he
grinned
it
is
because
there
such
a
radical
difference
between
the
and
the
movies
however
he
refers
to
musical
comedy
as
the
screamies
the
play
in
the
theatre
is
largely
a
matter
of
pantomime
you
know
dialogue
is
employed
to
advance
the
actual
plot
only
when
it
is
impossible
or
impracticable
to
do
it
with
dumb
show
and
when
i
think
of
some
of
the
lines
i
been
called
upon
to
spout
i
ca
say
that
i
regret
the
movies
lack
of
dialogue
what
does
hurt
though
he
admitted
is
the
absence
of
response
i
do
mean
applause
but
the
something
that
comes
up
over
the
footlights
to
you
from
the
audience
the
big
something
that
tells
you
instantly
whether
you
have
hit
it
or
missed
whether
you
are
ringing
true
or
false
you
do
get
that
in
the
pictures
your
audience
is
the
director
and
you
know
that
it
will
be
weeks
or
months
before
your
work
is
going
to
get
its
test
but
in
everything
else
the
movie
has
the
talkie
skinned
a
mile
instead
of
mouthing
somebody
else
words
you
are
doing
the
thing
yourself
there
action
and
life
one
day
you
are
in
the
forest
the
next
in
the
desert
the
next
on
the
sea
nonsense
i
exclaimed
i
understand
that
it
all
done
in
a
studio
i
had
the
idea
myself
he
laughed
but
no
more
when
i
was
in
the
i
used
to
hear
a
lot
about
realism
father
must
wash
in
a
real
basin
with
real
water
and
real
soap
there
had
to
be
two
hens
at
least
in
every
barnyard
scene
and
when
lottie
came
home
from
the
cruel
city
she
had
to
have
a
real
baby
in
her
arms
lordy
i
never
knew
what
realism
was
until
i
struck
the
movies
they
gone
crazy
over
it
you
know
was
adapted
from
one
of
bret
stories
and
nothing
would
do
the
director
but
a
trip
up
to
the
carquinez
woods
in
northern
california
a
forest
fire
figured
in
one
of
the
scenes
but
i
never
thought
much
about
it
until
i
saw
them
bringing
up
some
chemical
engines
hose
reels
and
five
or
six
the
idea
i
asked
keep
the
flames
from
spreading
they
told
me
and
let
me
tell
you
it
was
fire
after
i
got
out
of
it
i
felt
like
a
shave
from
a
mexican
barber
what
effect
is
the
movie
going
to
have
on
the
speaking
drama
was
my
next
question
look
at
the
effect
it
had
already
he
said
shaw
is
the
only
playwright
clever
enough
to
write
dialogue
that
will
hold
any
number
of
people
in
the
theatre
the
motion
picture
has
made
the
public
demand
it
has
changed
the
plot
and
progress
of
the
drama
completely
do
you
think
that
a
good
thing
does
it
mean
the
substitution
of
feeling
for
thinking
well
he
answered
slowly
the
world
goes
forward
through
the
heart
rather
than
through
the
head
happiness
to
my
mind
is
emotional
not
mental
and
the
movie
brought
happiness
to
millions
whose
lives
were
formerly
drab
and
sordid
i
love
to
go
into
these
little
halls
in
places
and
see
the
men
women
and
children
packed
there
of
an
evening
theatrical
companies
never
reached
the
villages
and
the
men
had
no
place
but
the
saloon
the
women
no
place
but
the
kitchen
or
the
front
porch
the
camera
has
brought
the
world
to
their
doors
and
life
is
richer
happier
and
better
for
it
take
him
as
he
stands
and
douglas
fairbanks
comes
close
to
being
the
real
thing
men
like
him
as
well
as
women
and
best
proof
of
all
the
kids
adore
him
on
a
recent
visit
to
denver
his
old
home
town
youngsters
followed
him
in
droves
clamoring
for
a
chance
to
feel
his
muscle
the
mayor
no
less
had
him
address
a
public
meeting
the
feature
of
which
by
the
way
was
this
piped
inquiry
from
the
gallery
say
doug
can
youse
whip
william
farnum
and
let
no
one
quarrel
with
this
popularity
it
is
a
good
sign
a
healthful
sign
a
token
that
the
blood
of
america
still
runs
warm
and
red
and
that
chalk
has
not
yet
softened
our
bones
