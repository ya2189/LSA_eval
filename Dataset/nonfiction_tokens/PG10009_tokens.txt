pleasant

of
that
broad
wilderness
lying
between
the
majestic

you

in

of

from
the
labors
of
a
profession
in
which
you

such

you

of

the
author
introductory
there
is
a
broad
sweep
of
country
lying
between
the
lawrence
and
lake
champlain
which
civilization
with
its
improvements
and
its
rush
of
progress
has
not
yet
invaded
it
is
mountainous
rocky
and
for
all
agricultural
purposes
sterile
and
unproductive
it
is
covered
with
dense
forests
and
inhabited
by
the
same
wild
things
save
the
red
man
alone
that
were
there
thousands
of
years
ago
it
abounds
in
the
most
beautiful
lakes
that
the
sun
or
the
stars
ever
shone
upon
i
have
stood
upon
the
immense
boulder
that
forms
the
head
or
summit
of
baldface
mountain
a
lofty
isolated
peak
looming
thousands
of
feet
towards
the
sky
and
counted
upwards
of
twenty
of
these
beautiful
lakes
sleeping
in
quiet
beauty
in
their
forest
beds
surrounded
by
primeval
woods
overlooked
by
rugged
hills
and
their
placid
waters
glowing
in
the
sunlight
it
is
a
high
region
from
which
numerous
rivers
take
their
rise
to
wander
away
through
gorges
and
narrow
valleys
sometimes
rushing
down
rapids
plunging
over
precipices
or
moving
in
deep
sluggish
currents
some
to
ontario
some
to
the
lawrence
some
to
champlain
and
some
to
seek
the
ocean
through
the
valley
of
the
hudson
the
air
of
this
mountain
region
in
the
summer
is
of
the
purest
loaded
always
with
the
freshness
and
the
pleasant
odors
of
the
forest
it
gives
strength
to
the
system
weakened
by
labor
or
reduced
by
the
corrupted
and
debilitating
atmosphere
of
the
cities
it
gives
elasticity
and
buoyancy
to
the
mind
depressed
by
continued
toil
or
the
cares
and
anxieties
of
business
and
makes
the
blood
course
through
the
veins
with
renewed
vigor
and
recuperated
vitality
the
invalid
whose
health
is
impaired
by
excessive
labor
but
who
is
yet
able
to
exercise
in
the
open
air
will
find
a
visit
to
these
beautiful
lakes
and
pleasant
rivers
and
a
fortnight
or
a
month
stay
among
them
vastly
more
efficacious
in
restoring
strength
and
tone
to
his
system
than
all
the
remedial
agencies
of
the
most
skillful
physicians
i
can
speak
understandingly
on
this
subject
and
from
evidences
furnished
by
my
own
personal
experience
and
observation
to
the
sportsman
whether
of
the
forest
or
flood
who
has
a
taste
for
nature
as
god
threw
it
from
his
hand
who
loves
the
mountains
the
old
woods
romantic
lakes
and
wild
forest
streams
this
region
is
peculiarly
inviting
the
lakes
the
rivers
and
the
streams
abound
in
trout
while
abundance
of
deer
feed
on
the
lily
pads
and
grasses
that
grow
in
the
shallow
water
or
the
natural
meadows
that
line
the
shore
the
fish
may
be
taken
at
any
season
and
during
the
months
of
july
and
august
he
will
find
deer
enough
feeding
along
the
margins
of
the
lakes
and
rivers
and
easily
to
be
come
at
to
satisfy
any
reasonable
or
honorable
sportsman
i
have
been
within
fair
shooting
distance
of
twenty
in
a
single
afternoon
while
floating
along
one
of
those
rivers
and
have
counted
upwards
of
forty
in
view
at
the
same
time
feeding
along
the
margin
of
one
of
the
beautiful
lakes
hid
away
in
the
deep
forest
the
scenery
i
have
attempted
to
describe
the
lakes
rivers
mountains
islands
rocks
valleys
and
streams
will
be
found
as
recorded
in
this
volume
the
game
will
be
found
as
i
have
asserted
unless
perchance
an
army
of
sportsmen
may
have
thinned
it
somewhat
on
the
borders
or
driven
it
deeper
into
the
broad
wilderness
spoken
of
i
was
over
a
portion
of
that
wilderness
last
summer
and
found
plenty
of
trout
and
abundance
of
deer
i
heard
the
howl
of
the
wolf
the
scream
of
the
panther
and
the
hoarse
bellow
of
the
moose
and
though
i
did
not
succeed
in
taking
or
even
seeing
any
of
these
latter
animals
yet
i
or
my
companion
slew
a
deer
every
day
after
we
entered
the
forest
and
might
have
slaughtered
half
a
dozen
had
we
been
so
disposed
though
the
excursion
spoken
of
in
the
following
pages
was
taken
four
years
ago
yet
i
found
the
last
summer
small
diminution
of
the
trout
even
in
the
border
streams
and
lakes
of
the
saranac
and
rackett
woods
i
have
visited
portions
of
this
wilderness
at
least
once
every
summer
for
the
last
ten
years
and
i
have
never
yet
been
disappointed
with
my
fortnight
sport
or
failed
to
meet
with
a
degree
of
success
which
abundantly
satisfied
me
at
least
i
have
generally
gone
into
the
woods
weakened
in
body
and
depressed
in
mind
i
have
always
come
out
of
them
with
renewed
health
and
strength
a
perfect
digestion
and
a
buoyant
and
cheerful
spirit
for
myself
i
have
come
to
regard
these
mountains
these
lakes
and
streams
these
old
forests
and
all
this
wild
region
as
my
settled
summer
resort
instead
of
the
discomforts
the
jam
the
excitement
and
the
unrest
of
the
or
the
sea
shore
i
visit
them
for
their
calm
seclusion
their
pure
air
their
natural
cheerfulness
their
transcendent
beauty
their
brilliant
mornings
their
glorious
sunsets
their
quiet
and
repose
i
visit
them
too
because
when
among
them
i
can
take
off
the
armor
which
one
is
compelled
to
wear
and
remove
the
watch
which
one
must
set
over
himself
in
the
crowded
thoroughfares
of
life
because
i
can
whistle
sing
shout
hurrah
and
be
jolly
without
exciting
the
ridicule
or
provoking
the
contempt
of
the
world
in
short
because
i
can
go
back
to
the
days
of
old
and
think
and
act
and
feel
like
a
boy

a
great
institution
it
is
a
great
institution
i
said
or
rather
thought
aloud
one
beautiful
summer
morning
as
my
wife
was
dressing
the
baby
the
little
thing
lay
upon
its
face
across
her
lap
paddling
and
kicking
with
its
little
bare
arms
and
legs
as
such
little
people
are
very
apt
to
do
while
being
dressed
it
was
not
our
baby
we
have
dispensed
with
that
luxury
and
yet
it
was
a
sweet
little
thing
and
nestled
as
closely
in
our
hearts
as
if
it
were
our
own
it
was
our
first
grandchild
the
beginning
of
a
third
generation
so
that
there
is
small
danger
of
our
name
becoming
extinct
a
friend
of
mine
who
unfortunately
has
no
voice
for
song
has
a
most
excellent
wife
and
beautiful
baby
and
can
not
therefore
be
said
to
be
without
music
at
home
it
is
his
first
descendant
and
everybody
knows
that
such
are
just
the
things
of
which
fathers
are
very
apt
to
be
proud
he
was
spending
an
evening
with
a
neighbor
and
was
asked
to
sing
he
declined
of
course
giving
as
a
reason
that
he
never
sang
why
h
said
a
little
girl
of
seven
why
h
do
you
never
sing
to
the
baby
sure
enough
i
wonder
if
there
ever
was
a
civilized
a
human
man
who
never
sang
to
the
baby
i
do
not
believe
that
there
was
ever
such
a
paradox
in
nature
as
a
man
who
had
tossed
the
baby
up
and
down
balanced
it
on
his
hand
given
it
a
ride
on
his
foot
and
yet
never
sang
to
it
i
do
not
care
a
fig
about
melody
of
voice
or
science
in
quavering
i
am
not
talking
about
sweetness
of
tone
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
man
living
even
though
he
have
no
more
voice
than
a
raven
who
is
human
and
yet
never
sang
to
the
baby
always
assuming
that
he
has
one
a
great
institution
i
repeated
half
in
soliloquy
and
half
to
my
wife
what
in
the
world
are
you
talking
about
said
h
as
she
took
a
pin
from
her
mouth
and
fastened
the
band
that
encircled
the
waist
of
the
baby
the
nurse
was
looking
quietly
on
quite
willing
that
her
work
should
be
thus
taken
off
her
hands
will
somebody
tell
me
if
there
ever
was
a
grandmother
especially
one
who
became
such
young
who
could
sit
by
and
see
the
nurse
dress
her
first
or
even
her
tenth
grandchild
while
it
was
a
helpless
little
thing
say
a
foot
or
a
foot
and
a
half
long
the
nurse
is
so
unhandy
she
tumbles
the
baby
about
so
roughly
handles
it
so
awkwardly
she
will
certainly
dress
it
too
loosely
or
too
tight
or
leave
a
pin
that
will
prick
it
or
some
terrible
calamity
will
happen
so
she
takes
possession
of
the
little
thing
and
with
a
hand
guided
by
experience
and
the
instincts
of
affection
puts
its
things
on
in
a
christian
and
comfortable
way
a
great
institution
i
repeated
again
i
do
believe
the
man
has
lost
his
wits
remarked
h
handing
the
baby
to
the
nurse
who
ever
heard
of
a
baby
less
than
three
months
old
being
called
an
institution
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
my
life
i
replied
though
a
much
greater
mistake
might
be
made
what
then
in
the
name
of
goodness
have
you
been
talking
about
inquired
h
the
country
of
course
i
replied
i
had
just
returned
from
a
business
trip
to
vermont
who
ever
thought
that
vermont
would
be
traversed
by
railroads
or
that
the
echoes
which
dwell
among
her
precipices
and
mountain
fastnesses
would
ever
wake
to
the
snort
of
the
iron
horse
who
ever
thought
that
the
locomotive
would
go
screaming
and
thundering
along
the
base
of
the
green
mountains
hurling
its
ponderous
train
loaded
with
human
freight
along
the
narrow
valleys
above
which
mountain
peaks
hide
their
heads
in
the
clouds
how
old
ethan
allen
and
general
stark
old
put
and
the
other
glorious
names
that
enrich
the
pages
of
our
revolutionary
history
would
open
their
eyes
in
astonishment
if
they
could
come
back
from
the
other
side
of
jordan
and
sit
for
a
little
while
on
their
own
tombstones
in
sight
of
the
railroads
and
see
the
trains
as
they
go
rushing
like
a
tornado
along
their
native
valleys
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
morning
all
at
once
to
go
into
the
country
it
was
a
sudden
resolve
but
i
acted
upon
it
going
into
the
country
is
a
very
different
thing
from
what
it
used
to
be
there
is
no
packing
of
trunks
or
taking
leave
of
friends
you
take
your
satchel
or
travelling
bag
kiss
your
wife
in
a
hurry
at
the
door
and
jump
aboard
of
the
cars
the
whistle
sounds
the
locomotive
breathes
hoarsely
for
a
moment
and
you
are
off
like
a
shot
in
ten
minutes
the
suburbs
are
behind
you
the
fields
and
farms
are
flying
to
the
rear
you
dash
through
the
woods
and
see
the
trees
dodging
and
leaping
behind
and
around
each
other
performing
the
dance
of
the
witches
in
most
admired
confusion
in
three
hours
you
are
among
the
hills
of
massachusetts
the
mountains
of
vermont
on
the
borders
of
the
majestic
hudson
in
the
beautiful
valley
of
the
mohawk
a
hundred
miles
from
the
good
city
of
albany
where
you
can
tramp
among
the
wild
or
tame
things
of
nature
to
your
heart
content
i
had
for
the
moment
no
particular
place
in
view
what
i
wanted
was
to
get
outside
of
the
city
among
the
hills
where
i
could
see
the
old
woods
the
streams
the
mountains
and
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
such
as
i
used
to
breathe
i
wanted
to
be
free
and
comfortable
for
a
month
to
lay
around
loose
in
a
promiscuous
way
among
the
hills
where
beautiful
lakes
lay
sleeping
in
their
quiet
loveliness
where
the
rivers
flow
on
their
everlasting
course
through
primeval
forests
where
the
moose
the
deer
the
panther
and
the
wolf
still
range
and
where
the
speckled
trout
sport
in
the
crystal
waters
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
throw
off
the
cares
and
anxieties
of
business
and
visit
that
great
institution
spread
out
all
around
us
by
the
almighty
to
make
men
healthier
wiser
better
i
had
resolved
to
go
into
the
country
that
was
a
fixed
fact
but
where
there
stood
my
rifle
in
one
corner
of
the
room
and
my
fishing
rods
in
the
other
the
sight
of
these
settled
the
matter
i
will
go
to
the
north
i
said
go
to
the
north
said
h
do
tell
me
if
you
got
another
of
your
old
hunting
and
fishing
fits
on
you
again
yes
i
replied
i
felt
it
coming
on
for
a
week
and
i
got
it
bad
very
well
said
my
wife
if
the
fit
is
on
you
there
no
use
in
remonstrating
your
valise
will
be
ready
by
the
morning
train
and
so
the
matter
was
settled
but
i
must
have
a
companion
somebody
to
talk
to
and
with
somebody
who
could
appreciate
the
beauties
of
nature
who
loved
the
old
woods
the
wilderness
and
all
the
wild
things
pertaining
to
them
to
whom
the
forests
the
lakes
and
tall
mountains
the
rivers
and
streams
would
recall
the
long
past
to
whom
the
forest
songs
and
sounds
would
bring
back
the
memories
of
old
and
make
him
a
boy
again
so
i
sallied
out
to
find
him
i
had
scarcely
traversed
a
square
when
i
met
my
friend
the
doctor
with
carpet
bag
in
hand
on
his
way
to
the
depot
whither
away
my
friend
i
inquired
as
we
shook
hands
into
the
country
he
replied
very
well
but
where
into
the
country
he
repeated
do
you
comprehend
into
the
country
by
the
first
train
anywhere
everywhere
all
along
shore
go
with
me
said
i
for
a
month
a
month
bless
your
simple
soul
every
patient
i
got
will
be
well
in
less
than
half
that
time
but
let
them
i
be
avenged
on
them
another
time
but
where
do
go
to
my
old
haunts
in
the
north
i
replied
to
follow
the
stag
to
his
crag
and
to
chase
the
bounding
roe
but
said
he
i
no
rifle
i
got
four
i
no
fishing
rod
i
half
a
dozen
at
your
service
give
me
your
hand
said
he
i
with
you
and
so
the
doctor
was
booked
suppose
said
the
doctor
we
beat
up
smith
and
spalding
and
take
them
along
smith
has
got
one
of
his
old
fits
of
the
hypo
he
sent
for
me
and
i
prescribed
a
frugal
diet
and
the
country
wild
game
and
bleeding
by
the
musquitoes
will
do
him
good
spalding
is
entitled
to
a
holiday
for
he
working
himself
into
dyspepsia
in
this
hot
weather
just
the
thing
i
replied
and
we
started
to
find
smith
and
spalding
we
found
them
and
it
was
settled
that
they
should
go
with
us
for
a
month
among
the
mountains
everybody
knows
smith
the
eccentric
smith
smith
the
bachelor
who
has
an
income
greatly
beyond
his
moderate
expenditures
and
enough
of
capital
to
spoil
as
he
says
the
orphan
children
of
his
sister
by
way
of
saving
them
from
being
thrown
upon
the
cold
world
with
a
fortune
he
declares
he
will
spend
every
dollar
of
it
simply
out
of
regard
for
but
smith
will
do
no
such
thing
and
the
tenderness
with
which
he
is
rearing
the
two
beautiful
little
girls
proves
that
he
will
not
but
smith
has
no
professional
calling
or
business
and
when
his
digestion
troubles
him
he
has
visions
of
the
and
the
potters
field
and
of
two
mendicant
little
girls
while
his
endorsement
would
be
regarded
as
good
at
the
bank
for
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
spalding
as
everybody
within
a
hundred
leagues
of
the
capitol
knows
is
a
lawyer
of
eminence
full
of
always
cheerful
always
instructive
a
troublesome
opponent
at
the
bar
a
man
of
genial
sympathies
and
a
big
heart
if
i
have
given
him
as
well
as
smith
a
de
it
is
out
of
regard
for
their
modesty
we
arranged
to
meet
at
the
cars
the
next
morning
at
six
each
with
a
rifle
and
fishing
rod
to
be
away
for
a
month
among
the
deer
and
the
trout
floating
over
lakes
the
most
beautiful
and
along
rivers
the
pleasantest
that
the
sun
ever
shone
upon
chapter
ii
hurrah
for
the
country
hurrah
hurrah
we
are
in
the
country
the
glorious
country
outside
of
the
thronged
streets
away
from
piled
up
bricks
and
mortar
outside
of
the
clank
of
machinery
the
rumbling
of
carriages
the
roar
of
the
escape
pipe
the
scream
of
the
steam
whistle
the
tramp
tramp
of
moving
thousands
on
the
stone
sidewalks
away
from
the
heated
atmosphere
of
the
city
loaded
with
the
smoke
and
dust
and
gasses
of
furnaces
and
the
ten
thousand
manufactories
of
villainous
smells
we
are
beyond
even
the
meadows
and
green
fields
we
are
here
alone
with
nature
surrounded
by
old
primeval
things
tall
forest
trees
mountain
and
valley
are
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
before
us
stretching
away
for
miles
is
a
beautiful
lake
its
waters
calm
and
placid
giving
back
the
bright
heavens
the
old
woods
the
fleecy
clouds
that
drift
across
the
sky
from
away
down
in
its
quiet
depths
beyond
still
are
mountain
ranges
whose
castellated
peaks
stand
out
in
sharp
and
bold
relief
on
whose
tops
the
beams
of
the
descending
sun
lie
like
a
mantle
of
silver
and
gold
glad
voices
are
ringing
sounds
of
merriment
make
the
evening
joyous
with
the
music
of
the
wild
things
around
us
hark
how
from
away
off
over
the
water
the
voice
of
the
loon
comes
clear
and
musical
and
shrill
like
the
sound
of
a
clarion
and
note
how
it
is
borne
about
by
the
echoes
from
hill
to
hill
hark
again
to
that
clanking
sound
away
up
in
the
air
metallic
ringing
like
the
tones
of
a
bell
it
is
the
call
of
the
cock
of
the
woods
as
he
flies
rising
and
falling
glancing
upward
and
downward
in
his
billowy
flight
across
the
lake
hark
to
that
dull
sound
like
blows
upon
some
soft
hollow
half
sonorous
substance
slow
and
measured
at
first
but
increasing
in
rapidity
until
it
rolls
like
the
beat
of
a
muffled
drum
or
the
low
growl
of
the
thunder
it
is
the
partridge
drumming
upon
his
log
hark
still
again
to
that
quavering
note
resembling
somewhat
the
voice
of
the
when
the
storm
is
gathering
but
not
so
clear
and
shrill
it
is
the
call
of
the
raccoon
as
he
clambers
up
some
old
forest
tree
and
seats
himself
among
the
lowest
of
its
great
limbs
listen
to
the
almost
human
halloo
the
hoo
hohoo
hoo
that
comes
out
from
the
clustering
foliage
of
an
ancient
hemlock
it
is
the
solemn
call
of
the
owl
as
he
sits
among
the
limbs
looking
out
from
between
the
branches
with
his
great
round
grey
eyes
listen
again
and
you
will
hear
the
voice
of
the
catbird
the
brown
thrush
the
chervink
the
little
chickadee
the
wood
robin
the
the
wood
sparrow
and
a
hundred
other
nameless
birds
that
live
and
build
their
nests
and
sing
among
these
old
woods
but
go
a
little
nearer
the
lake
and
you
will
have
a
concert
that
will
drown
all
these
voices
in
its
tumultuous
roar
compared
to
these
feeble
strains
it
is
the
crashing
of
julien
hundred
brazen
instruments
to
the
soft
and
sweet
melody
of
ole
bull
violin
come
with
me
to
this
rocky
promontory
stand
with
me
on
this
boulder
which
forms
the
point
on
either
hand
is
a
little
bay
the
head
of
which
is
hidden
around
among
the
woods
see
over
against
us
on
the
limb
of
that
dead
fir
tree
which
leans
out
over
the
water
is
a
bald
eagle
straightening
with
his
hooked
beak
the
feathers
of
his
wings
and
pausing
now
and
then
to
look
out
over
the
water
for
some
careless
duck
of
which
to
make
prey
see
he
has
leaped
from
his
perch
has
spread
his
broad
pinions
and
is
soaring
upward
towards
the
sky
see
how
he
circles
round
and
round
mounting
higher
and
higher
at
every
gyration
he
is
like
a
speck
in
the
air
but
see
he
is
above
the
mountains
now
and
how
like
an
arrow
he
goes
straight
forward
with
no
visible
motion
to
his
wings
he
has
laid
his
course
for
some
lake
deeper
in
the
wilderness
beyond
that
range
of
hills
and
he
is
there
even
while
we
are
talking
of
his
flight
a
swift
bird
the
swiftest
of
all
the
birds
is
the
eagle
when
he
takes
his
descending
stoop
from
his
place
away
up
in
the
sky
he
cleaves
the
air
like
a
bullet
and
so
swift
is
his
career
that
the
eye
can
scarcely
trace
his
flight
but
hark
all
is
still
now
save
the
piping
notes
of
the
little
peeper
along
the
shore
wait
however
a
moment
there
hear
that
venerable
podunker
off
to
the
right
with
his
deep
bass
like
the
sound
of
a
brazen
serpent
listen
another
deep
voice
on
the
left
has
fallen
in
there
another
right
over
against
us
another
and
another
still
a
dozen
a
hundred
a
thousand
ten
thousand
a
million
of
them
close
by
us
far
off
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
here
there
everywhere
until
above
around
us
all
through
the
woods
all
along
the
shore
all
over
the
lake
is
a
solid
roar
impenetrable
to
any
other
sound
surging
and
swaying
rolling
and
swelling
as
if
all
the
voices
in
the
world
were
concentrated
in
one
stupendous
concert
but
hark
the
roar
is
dying
away
voice
after
voice
drops
out
here
and
there
is
one
laggard
in
the
song
still
dragging
out
the
chorus
now
all
is
still
again
save
the
note
of
the
little
peeper
along
the
shore
in
two
minutes
that
band
will
strike
up
again
the
roar
will
go
bellowing
over
the
lake
through
the
woods
to
be
thrown
from
hill
to
hill
to
die
away
into
silence
again
and
so
it
will
be
through
all
the
long
night
and
until
the
sun
looks
out
from
among
the
tree
tops
in
the
morning
touch
that
solemn
looking
old
croaker
on
yonder
broad
leaf
of
that
pond
lily
with
the
end
of
your
fishing
rod
while
the
music
is
at
the
highest
he
will
send
forth
a
quick
discordant
and
cracked
cry
like
that
of
a
greedy
dog
choked
with
a
bone
as
he
plunges
for
the
bottom
and
note
how
suddenly
that
sound
will
be
repeated
and
how
quick
the
roar
of
the
frogs
will
be
hushed
into
silence
that
is
a
cry
of
alarm
a
note
of
danger
and
every
frog
within
hearing
understands
its
import
is
it
asked
we
are
i
answer
we
are
on
the
lower
saranac
lake
just
on
the
south
point
at
the
entrance
of
the
romantic
little
bay
at
the
head
of
which
stands
martin
lake
house
the
only
human
dwelling
in
sight
of
this
beautiful
sheet
of
water
on
the
point
where
we
now
are
long
ago
was
the
log
shanty
of
a
hunter
and
fisherman
surrounded
by
an
acre
or
two
of
cleared
land
but
its
occupant
moved
deeper
into
the
wilderness
over
on
the
waters
of
the
rackett
many
years
since
the
log
shanty
has
rotted
away
and
a
vigorous
growth
of
brush
and
small
timber
now
covers
what
once
may
have
been
called
a
field
but
the
night
shadows
are
beginning
to
gather
over
the
forest
throwing
a
sort
of
spectral
gloom
among
the
old
woods
giving
a
distorted
look
to
the
trunks
of
the
trees
the
low
bushes
the
turned
up
roots
and
the
boulders
scattered
over
the
ground
see
what
ogre
shapes
these
things
assume
as
the
darkness
deepens
look
at
that
cedar
bush
with
its
dense
foliage
it
is
a
crouching
lion
and
as
its
branches
wave
in
the
gentle
breeze
he
seems
preparing
for
his
leap
and
yonder
boulder
is
a
huge
elephant
the
root
that
comes
out
from
the
crevice
is
his
trunk
and
the
moss
and
lichens
which
hang
down
on
either
side
are
his
pendant
ears
and
see
he
has
a
great
tower
on
his
back
wherein
is
seated
a
warrior
in
his
ancient
armor
grasping
and
spear
beyond
through
that
opening
upon
the
bay
is
a
castle
looming
darkly
against
the
sky
with
massive
towers
and
arched
gateway
such
are
the
forms
which
fancy
gives
to
these
forest
things
in
the
doubtful
twilight
of
a
summer
evening
while
we
have
been
looking
upon
these
unsubstantial
shadows
the
sunlight
has
left
the
mountain
peaks
the
stars
have
come
out
in
the
sky
and
the
moon
has
started
on
her
course
across
the
heavens
let
us
rest
on
our
oars
a
moment
here
in
the
bay
to
view
the
scenery
around
us
as
seen
by
the
mellow
moonlight
so
calm
so
still
so
motionless
are
both
air
and
water
that
we
seem
suspended
between
the
sky
above
sparkling
and
glowing
with
millions
of
bright
stars
and
the
moon
riding
gloriously
on
her
course
and
a
sky
beneath
sparkling
and
glowing
with
like
millions
of
bright
stars
and
the
same
moon
or
its
counterpart
floating
away
down
in
fathomless
depths
below
us
see
how
the
same
hillside
the
same
line
of
forest
trees
the
same
ranges
and
mountain
peaks
are
reflected
back
from
the
stirless
bosom
of
the
lake
there
above
and
just
on
the
upper
line
of
that
tall
peak
looming
darkly
and
majestically
in
the
distance
hangs
a
brilliant
star
sparkling
and
twinkling
like
the
sheen
of
a
diamond
and
right
beneath
away
down
just
as
far
below
the
surface
of
the
water
as
mountain
peak
and
star
are
above
it
is
another
mountain
peak
and
bright
star
twinned
by
the
mirrored
waters
see
away
down
the
lake
that
little
island
with
its
half
dozen
spruce
trees
clustered
together
how
like
a
great
war
vessel
it
looks
with
sails
all
set
as
seen
by
the
uncertain
light
of
the
moon
and
that
other
island
off
to
the
left
with
the
dead
and
barkless
trees
how
like
a
tall
ship
with
bare
masts
riding
at
anchor
it
seems
that
other
island
away
to
the
right
with
its
great
boulders
and
bare
rocks
rising
straight
up
out
of
the
water
is
a
fortification
a
stronghold
surrounded
by
a
wall
of
solid
masonry
and
bristling
with
cannon
we
can
almost
see
the
sentinel
and
hear
his
measured
tramp
as
he
travels
his
lonely
rounds
keeping
watch
out
over
the
waters
see
all
along
the
shore
as
you
look
up
the
bay
towards
the
lake
house
how
the
millions
of
fireflies
flash
their
tiny
torches
upward
and
downward
this
way
and
that
mingling
and
crossing
and
gyrating
and
whirling
a
troubled
and
billowy
sea
of
millions
upon
millions
of
glowing
and
sparkling
gems
reader
were
you
and
i
gifted
with
the
spirit
of
poetry
what
inspiration
would
we
not
gather
from
the
glories
which
surround
us
as
we
float
of
a
summer
evening
over
these
beautiful
lakes
sleeping
away
out
here
in
all
their
virgin
loveliness
among
these
old
primeval
things
but
you
ask
what
inspiration
can
there
be
in
a
moon
and
stars
that
we
see
every
night
when
the
sky
is
cloudless
in
a
desolate
wilderness
the
roar
of
the
frogs
the
hooting
of
owls
these
useless
waters
the
phosphorescent
flash
of
lightning
bugs
these
piled
up
rocks
and
barren
mountains
can
you
grow
corn
on
these
hills
or
make
pastures
of
these
rocky
lowlands
can
you
harness
these
rivers
to
great
waterwheels
or
make
reservoirs
of
these
lakes
can
you
convert
these
old
forests
into
lumber
or
cordwood
can
you
quarry
these
rocks
lay
them
up
with
mortar
into
houses
mills
churches
public
edifices
can
you
make
what
you
call
these
primeval
things
utilitarian
can
you
make
them
minister
to
the
progress
of
civilization
or
coin
them
into
dollars
pshaw
you
have
spoiled
with
your
worldliness
your
greed
for
progress
your
thirst
for
gain
a
pleasant
fancy
a
glorious
dream
as
if
everything
in
the
heavens
on

or

were
to
be
measured
by

and

standard
and

let

row
back
to
the

chapter
iii
the
departure
the
stag
hounds
the
chase
round
lake
from
martin
lake
house
we
were
to
take
our
departure
in
the
morning
we
had
arranged
for
three
boats
and
as
many
stalwart
boatmen
two
of
these
boats
were
for
our
own
conveyance
and
one
for
our
luggage
and
provisions
the
latter
to
be
sent
forward
with
our
tents
in
advance
so
as
to
have
a
home
ready
for
us
always
at
our
coming
when
we
chose
to
linger
by
the
way
these
boatmen
were
all
jolly
and
pleasant
people
with
a
vast
deal
of
practical
sense
and
a
valuable
experience
in
woodcraft
albeit
they
were
rough
and
unpolished
their
hearts
were
in
the
right
place
and
they
commanded
our
respect
always
for
their
kindness
and
attention
to
our
wants
while
they
maintained
at
all
times
that
sturdy
independence
which
enters
so
largely
into
the
character
of
the
border
men
of
our
country
their
boats
are
constructed
of
spruce
or
cedar
boards
of
a
quarter
of
an
inch
in
thickness
as
the
expression
is
upon
knees
of
the
natural
crook
and
weigh
from
ninety
to
one
hundred
and
ten
pounds
each
they
are
carried
around
rapids
or
from
river
to
river
on
the
back
of
the
boatman
in
this
wise
a
yoke
is
provided
such
as
every
man
in
the
country
especially
all
who
have
visited
a
sugar
bush
at
the
season
of
sugar
making
has
seen
at
the
end
of
this
yoke
is
a
round
iron
projection
made
to
fit
into
a
socket
in
the
upper
rave
of
the
boat
the
craft
is
turned
bottom
upwards
the
yoke
adjusted
to
the
shoulders
the
iron
projections
fitted
into
the
sockets
and
the
boatman
marches
off
with
his
boat
like
a
turtle
with
his
shell
upon
his
back
he
will
carry
it
thus
sometimes
half
a
mile
before
stopping
to
rest
with
us
were
to
go
two
staid
and
sober
stag
hounds
grave
in
aspect
and
trained
and
experienced
almost
in
woodcraft
as
their
masters
animals
that
had
been
reared
together
and
who
possessed
the
rare
instinct
of
returning
always
to
the
shanty
from
which
they
started
however
far
the
chase
may
have
led
them
it
was
a
glorious
sound
in
the
old
forests
the
music
of
those
two
hounds
as
their
voices
rang
out
bold
and
free
like
a
bugle
and
went
ringing
through
the
forest
echoing
among
the
mountains
and
dying
away
over
the
lakes
but
of
that
hereafter
our
little
fleet
swung
out
upon
the
water
while
the
sun
was
yet
hanging
like
a
great
torch
among
the
tops
of
the
trees
on
the
eastern
hills
it
was
a
beautiful
morning
so
fresh
so
genial
so
balmy
a
pleasant
breeze
came
sweeping
lazily
over
the
lake
and
went
sighing
and
moaning
among
the
old
forest
trees
all
around
us
were
glad
voices
the
partridge
drummed
upon
his
log
the
squirrels
chattered
as
they
chased
each
other
up
and
down
the
great
trunks
of
the
trees
the
loon
lifted
up
his
clarion
voice
away
out
upon
the
water
the
eagle
and
the
osprey
screamed
as
they
hovered
high
above
us
in
the
air
while
a
thousand
merry
voices
came
from
out
the
old
woods
all
mingling
in
the
harmony
of
nature
gladness
a
loud
and
repeated
hurrah
burst
from
us
all
as
our
oars
struck
the
water
and
sent
our
little
boats
bounding
over
the
rippled
surface
of
the
beautiful
saranac
this
is
a
indeed
a
beautiful
sheet
of
water
the
shores
were
lined
with
a
dense
and
unbroken
forest
stretching
back
to
the
mountains
which
surround
it
the
old
wood
stood
then
in
all
its
primeval
grandeur
just
as
it
grew
the
axe
had
not
harmed
it
nor
had
fire
marred
its
beauty
the
islands
were
covered
with
a
lofty
growth
of
living
timber
clothed
in
the
deepest
green
there
were
not
then
as
now
upon
some
of
them
great
dead
trees
reaching
out
their
long
bare
arms
in
verdureless
desolation
above
a
stinted
undergrowth
and
piled
up
trunks
charred
and
blackened
by
the
fire
that
had
revelled
among
them
but
all
were
green
and
thrifty
and
glorious
in
their
robes
of
beauty
thousands
of
happy
songsters
carolled
gaily
among
their
branches
or
hid
themselves
in
the
dense
foliage
of
their
arms
the
islands
are
a
marked
feature
of
these
northern
lakes
lending
a
peculiar
charm
to
their
quiet
beauty
and
one
day
when
the
iron
horse
shall
go
thundering
through
these
mountain
gorges
the
tourist
will
pause
to
make
a
record
of
their
loveliness
four
or
five
miles
down
the
lake
is
a
beautiful
bay
stretching
for
near
half
a
mile
around
a
high
promontory
almost
reaching
another
bay
winding
around
a
like
promontory
beyond
leaving
a
peninsula
of
five
hundred
acres
joined
to
the
main
land
by
a
narrow
neck
of
some
forty
rods
in
width
our
first
sport
among
the
deer
was
to
be
the
driving
of
this
peninsula
we
stationed
ourselves
on
the
narrow
isthmus
within
a
few
rods
of
each
other
while
a
boatman
went
round
to
the
opposite
side
to
lay
on
the
dogs
we
had
been
at
our
posts
perhaps
half
an
hour
when
we
heard
the
measured
bounds
of
a
deer
as
he
came
crashing
through
the
forest
we
could
see
his
white
flag
waving
above
the
undergrowth
as
he
came
bounding
towards
us
neither
smith
nor
spalding
had
ever
seen
a
deer
in
his
native
woods
and
they
were
by
a
previous
arrangement
to
have
the
first
shot
if
circumstances
should
permit
it
the
noble
animal
came
dashing
proudly
on
his
way
as
if
in
contempt
of
the
danger
he
was
leaving
behind
him
of
the
greater
danger
into
which
he
was
rushing
he
was
entirely
unconscious
until
the
crack
of
smith
rifle
broke
upon
his
astonished
ear
he
was
unharmed
however
and
quick
as
thought
he
wheeled
and
plunged
back
in
the
direction
from
which
he
came
spalding
rifle
as
it
echoed
through
the
forest
with
the
whistling
of
the
ball
in
close
proximity
to
his
head
added
energy
to
his
flight
the
rifles
were
scarcely
reloaded
when
the
deep
baying
of
the
hounds
was
heard
and
two
more
deer
came
crashing
across
the
isthmus
where
we
were
stationed
the
foremost
one
went
down
before
the
unerring
rifle
and
cool
aim
while
the
other
ran
the
gauntlet
of
the
three
other
rifles
horribly
frightened
but
unharmed
away
the
hounds
were
called
off
and
with
our
game
in
one
of
the
boats
we
rowed
back
around
the
promontory
and
passed
on
towards
the
saranac
river
which
connects
by
a
tortuous
course
of
five
miles
the
lower
saranac
with
round
lake
midway
between
these
two
lakes
is
a
fall
or
rather
rapids
down
which
the
river
descends
some
ten
feet
in
five
or
six
rods
through
a
narrow
rocky
channel
around
which
the
boats
had
to
be
carried
while
this
was
being
done
smith
and
spalding
adjusted
their
rods
eager
to
make
up
in
catching
trout
what
they
failed
to
achieve
in
the
matter
of
venison
and
they
succeeded
in
twenty
minutes
they
had
fifteen
beautiful
fish
none
weighing
less
than
half
a
pound
safely
deposited
on
the
broad
flat
rock
at
the
head
of
the
rapids
one
throw
more
said
smith
and
i
done
and
he
cast
his
fly
across
the
still
water
just
above
the
fall
quick
as
thought
it
was
taken
by
a
trout
landing
nets
and
gaff
had
been
sent
forward
with
the
baggage
and
without
these
it
was
an
exciting
and
delicate
thing
to
land
that
fish
the
game
was
to
prevent
him
dashing
away
down
the
rapids
or
diving
beneath
the
shelving
rock
above
the
sharp
edge
of
which
would
have
severed
the
line
like
a
knife
skillfully
and
beautifully
smith
played
him
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
until
at
last
the
fish
turned
his
orange
belly
to
the
surface
and
ceased
to
struggle
he
was
drowned
we
had
in
the
morning
directed
the
boatman
in
charge
of
the
baggage
to
go
on
in
advance
and
erect
our
tents
on
an
island
in
round
lake
when
we
entered
this
beautiful
sheet
of
water
about
four
we
saw
the
white
tents
standing
near
the
shore
of
the
island
with
a
column
of
smoke
curling
gracefully
up
among
the
tall
trees
that
overshadowed
them
when
we
arrived
we
found
everything
in
order
they
were
pitched
in
a
pleasant
spot
looking
out
to
the
west
over
the
water
while
within
were
beds
of
green
boughs
from
the
spruce
and
fir
trees
and
bundles
of
boughs
tied
up
like
faggots
for
pillows
our
first
dinner
in
the
wilderness
was
a
pleasant
one
albeit
the
cookery
was
somewhat
primitive
with
fresh
venison
and
trout
seasoned
with
sweet
salt
pork
we
got
through
with
it
uncomplainingly
this
little
lake
is
a
gem
it
is
as
its
name
purports
round
some
four
miles
in
diameter
surrounded
by
an
amphitheatre
of
hills
beneath
whose
shadows
it
reposes
in
placid
and
quiet
beauty
on
the
northeast
ballface
mountain
rears
its
tall
head
far
above
the
intervening
ranges
while
away
off
in
the
east
mount
marcy
and
mount
seward
stand
out
dim
and
shadowy
against
the
sky
nearer
are
the
keene
ranges
ragged
and
lofty
their
bare
and
rocky
summits
glistening
in
the
sunlight
while
nearer
still
the
hills
rise
sometimes
with
steep
and
ragged
acclivity
and
sometimes
gently
from
the
shore
here
and
there
a
valley
winds
away
among
the
highlands
along
which
the
mountain
streams
come
bounding
down
rapids
or
moving
in
deep
and
sluggish
but
pure
currents
towards
the
lake
the
rugged
and
sublime
with
the
placid
and
beautiful
in
natural
scenery
are
magnificently
mingled
in
the
surroundings
of
this
little
sheet
of
water
chapter
iv
the
doctor
story
a
slippery
fish
a
lawsuit
and
a
compromise
there
seems
to
be
a
law
or
rather
a
habit
pertaining
to
forest
life
into
which
every
one
falls
while
upon
excursions
such
as
ours
stories
occupy
the
place
of
books
and
tales
of
the
marvellous
furnish
a
substitute
for
the
evening
papers
not
that
there
should
be
any
set
rule
or
system
in
regard
to
the
ordering
of
the
matter
but
a
sort
of
spontaneous
movement
an
implied
understanding
growing
out
of
the
necessities
of
the
position
of
isolation
occupied
by
those
who
are
away
from
the
resources
of
civilization
the
doctor
had
a
genius
for
story
telling
or
rather
a
genius
for
invention
which
required
only
a
moderate
development
of
the
organ
of
credulity
on
the
part
of
his
hearers
to
render
him
unrivalled
there
was
an
appearance
of
frank
earnestness
about
his
manner
of
relating
his
adventures
which
however
improbable
or
even
impossible
as
matter
of
fact
they
might
be
commanded
for
the
moment
absolute
credence
they
a
curious
fish
in
the
lawrence
said
the
doctor
as
he
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
meerschaum
and
refilled
it
known
among
the
fishermen
of
that
river
as
the
lawyer
i
have
never
seen
it
among
any
other
of
the
waters
of
this
country
and
never
there
but
once
it
never
bites
at
a
hook
and
is
taken
only
by
or
the
seine
everybody
he
continued
has
visited
the
thousand
islands
or
if
everybody
has
not
he
had
better
go
there
at
once
he
will
find
them
in
the
heat
of
summer
not
only
the
coolest
and
most
healthful
retreat
and
the
pleasantest
scenery
that
the
eye
ever
rested
upon
always
excepting
these
beautiful
lakes
but
the
best
river
fishing
i
know
of
on
this
continent
he
will
not
to
be
sure
take
the
speckled
trout
that
we
find
in
this
region
but
he
will
be
among
the
black
bass
the
pickerel
muscalunge
and
striped
bass
in
the
greatest
abundance
and
ready
to
answer
promptly
any
reasonable
demand
which
he
may
make
upon
them
think
of
reeling
in
a
pickerel
or
a
muscalunge
on
a
line
three
hundred
feet
in
length
playing
him
for
half
an
hour
and
landing
him
safely
in
your
boat
at
last
there
excitement
for
you
worth
talking
about
i
stopped
over
night
at
cape
vincent
last
summer
on
my
way
to
thousand
islands
on
a
fishing
excursion
of
a
week
i
was
acquainted
with
an
old
fisherman
of
that
place
and
agreed
to
go
out
with
him
the
next
morning
to
see
what
luck
he
had
with
the
fish
i
do
think
much
of
that
kind
of
fishing
though
it
is
well
enough
for
those
who
make
a
business
of
it
for
the
works
as
the
old
man
said
while
the
fisherman
sleeps
and
all
he
gets
in
that
way
is
clear
gain
well
i
rose
early
the
next
morning
to
go
out
with
the
old
fisherman
to
his
it
would
have
done
you
good
as
it
did
me
to
see
how
merry
every
living
thing
was
the
birds
how
jolly
they
were
and
how
refreshing
the
breeze
was
that
came
stealing
over
the
water
making
one
feel
as
if
he
would
like
to
shout
and
hurrah
in
the
buoyancy
the
brightness
and
glory
of
the
morning
but
i
am
not
going
to
be
poetical
about
the
sunrise
and
the
singing
birds
we
went
out
upon
the
river
just
as
the
sun
came
up
with
his
great
round
red
face
for
there
was
a
light
smoky
haze
floating
above
the
eastern
horizon
and
threw
his
light
like
a
stream
of
crimson
flame
across
the
water
and
the
meadow
lark
perched
upon
his
fence
stake
the
blackbird
upon
his
alderbush
the
brown
thrush
on
the
topmost
spray
of
the
wild
thorn
and
the
as
he
leaped
from
the
meadow
and
poised
himself
on
his
fluttering
wings
in
mid
air
all
sent
up
a
shout
of
gladness
as
if
hailing
the
god
of
the
morning
we
came
to
the
nets
and
began
to
draw
in
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
fish
there
were
pickerel
from
four
to
ten
pounds
in
weight
white
fish
black
bass
rock
bass
oswego
bass
and
pike
by
the
dozen
and
what
was
a
stranger
to
me
a
queer
looking
specimen
of
the
piscatory
tribes
half
and
half
eel
with
a
cross
of
the
lizard
on
earth
is
that
said
i
to
the
fisherman
said
he
a
species
of
ling
we
call
it
in
these
parts
a
lawyer
said
i
pray
do
know
he
replied
it
because
he
ai
of
much
use
and
is
the
slipriest
fish
that
swims
mark
continued
the
doctor
turning
to
spalding
i
mean
no
personality
i
am
simply
giving
the
old
fisherman
words
not
my
own
proceed
with
the
case
said
spalding
as
he
sent
a
column
of
smoke
curling
upward
from
his
lips
and
with
a
gravity
that
was
refreshing
well
resumed
the
doctor
the
lawyers
were
thrown
by
themselves
and
one
old
fat
fellow
weighing
perhaps
five
or
six
pounds
fixed
his
great
round
glassy
eyes
upon
me
and
opened
his
ugly
mouth
and
i
thought
i
heard
him
say
interrogatively
as
if
demanding
that
the
should
proceed
at
once
said
i
in
reply
out
out
he
answered
out
i
out
of
my
element
out
of
water
out
of
court
and
in
this
hot
dry
atmosphere
almost
out
of
breath
but
what
have
i
been
summoned
here
for
i
demand
a
copy
of
the
complaint
dear
sir
said
i
not
a
member
of
the
court
i
do
belong
to
the
bar
i
not
the
plaintiff
i
not
in
the
profession
nor
on
the
bench
i
neither
sheriff
constable
nor
juror
i
only
a
spectator
in
the
rackett
woods
among
the
lakes
and
streams
of
that
wild
region
with
a
rod
and
fly
i
at
home
with
the
trout
but
ho
he
exclaimed
with
a
chuckle
the
chap
i
was
consulted
about
down
near
the
mouth
of
the
rackett
the
other
day
by
a
country
trout
who
was
on
a
journey
to
visit
his
relatives
in
the
streams
of
canada
he
showed
me
a
hole
in
his
jaw
made
by
your
hook
at
the
mouth
of
the
bog
river
i
filed
a
summons
and
complaint
against
you
for
assault
and
battery
and
beg
to
notify
you
of
the
fact
plead
the
general
issue
said
i
no
such
thing
known
to
the
code
he
replied
deny
the
fact
then
i
exclaimed
wo
do
he
rejoined
complaint
is
put
in
under
oath
and
you
must
answer
by
affidavit
of
the
truth
of
your
denial
you
see
my
dilemma
i
remembered
the
circumstance
of
hooking
a
noble
trout
at
the
place
alleged
and
as
the
affair
has
been
settled
tell
you
how
it
was
at
the
head
of
tupper
lake
one
of
the
most
beautiful
sheets
of
water
that
the
sun
ever
shone
upon
lying
alone
among
the
mountains
surrounded
by
old
primeval
forests
walled
in
by
palisadoes
of
rocks
and
studded
with
islands
the
bog
river
enters
this
river
comes
down
from
the
hills
away
back
in
the
wilderness
sometimes
rushing
with
a
roar
over
rocks
and
through
gorges
sometimes
plunging
down
precipices
and
sometimes
moving
with
a
deep
and
sluggish
current
across
a
broad
sweep
of
table
land
for
several
miles
back
of
the
lake
and
until
a
few
rods
of
the
shore
it
is
a
calm
deep
river
it
then
rushes
down
a
steep
shelving
rock
some
twenty
feet
into
a
great
rocky
basin
then
down
again
over
a
shelving
rock
in
a
fall
of
twenty
feet
into
another
rocky
basin
and
then
again
in
another
fall
of
twenty
or
thirty
feet
over
a
steep
shelving
rock
shooting
with
a
swift
current
far
out
into
the
lake
these
falls
constitute
a
beautiful
cascade
and
their
roar
may
be
heard
of
a
calm
summer
evening
for
miles
out
on
the
placid
water
at
the
foot
of
these
falls
in
the
summer
season
the
trout
congregate
beautiful
large
fellows
from
one
to
three
pounds
in
weight
and
a
fly
trailed
across
the
current
or
over
the
eddies
just
at
its
outer
edge
is
a
thing
at
which
they
are
tolerably
sure
to
rise
well
last
summer
i
was
out
that
way
among
the
lakes
that
lie
sleeping
in
beauty
and
along
the
streams
that
flow
through
the
old
woods
playing
the
savage
and
vagabondizing
in
a
promiscuous
way
the
river
was
low
and
a
broad
rock
smooth
and
bare
sloping
gently
to
the
water
edge
under
which
the
stream
whirled
as
it
entered
the
lake
and
above
which
tall
trees
towered
casting
over
it
a
pleasant
shade
presented
a
tempting
place
to
throw
the
fly
i
cast
over
the
current
and
trailed
along
towards
the
edge
of
the
rock
when
a
rose
from
his
place
down
in
the
deep
water
he
come
head
foremost
nor
glancing
upward
but
rose
square
up
to
the
surface
and
pausing
a
single
instant
darted
forward
like
an
arrow
and
seized
the
fly
well
away
he
plunged
with
the
hook
in
his
jaw
bending
my
elastic
rod
like
a
reed
the
reel
hissing
as
the
line
spun
away
eighty
or
a
hundred
feet
across
the
current
and
far
out
into
the
lake
but
he
was
fast
and
after
struggling
for
a
time
he
partially
surrendered
and
i
reeled
him
in
slowly
and
with
a
sullen
struggling
he
was
drawn
towards
the
shore
sometimes
with
his
head
out
of
water
and
sometimes
diving
towards
the
bottom
at
last
he
caught
sight
of
me
and
with
renewed
energy
he
plunged
away
again
clear
across
the
current
and
out
into
the
lake
but
the
tension
of
the
elastic
rod
working
against
him
steadily
and
always
was
too
much
for
his
strength
and
again
i
reeled
him
in
struggling
still
though
faintly
slowly
but
steadily
i
reeled
him
to
my
hand
he
was
just
by
the
edge
of
the
rock
almost
within
reach
of
my
landing
net
when
with
a
last
desperate
effort
to
escape
he
plunged
towards
the
bottom
made
a
dive
under
the
rock
the
line
came
against
its
edge
slipped
gratingly
for
a
moment
snapped
and
the
fish
was
gone
he
was
a
beautiful
trout
and
beautifully
he
played
he
deserved
freedom
on
account
of
the
energy
with
which
he
struggled
for
it
you
will
see
therefore
that
as
i
said
i
was
in
a
dilemma
the
action
against
me
was
well
brought
i
could
not
deny
the
truth
of
the
facts
charged
against
me
in
the
complaint
in
this
position
of
affairs
three
alternatives
presented
themselves
first
a
denial
of
the
truth
of
the
complaint
but
that
involved
perjury
secondly
admission
of
the
facts
charged
but
that
involved
conviction
and
thirdly
a
compromise
and
the
latter
one
i
adopted
this
thing
be
settled
said
i
to
the
old
lawyer
fish
of
the
lawrence
litigation
me
and
my
four
companions
overboard
place
us
in
and
the
action
shall
be
discontinued
said
i
and
i
reached
down
to
enter
upon
the
performance
of
my
part
of
the
contract
a
moment
said
he
curling
up
his
shaky
tail
costs
who
pays
the
costs
costs
i
replied
pays
his
own
of
course
so
fast
he
exclaimed
quite
so
fast
you
must
pay
the
costs
or
the
suit
goes
on
there
was
something
human
in
the
tenacity
with
which
that
old
clung
to
the
idea
of
costs
there
he
was
gasping
for
breath
his
life
depending
upon
the
result
of
the
negotiation
and
still
he
insisted
upon
the
payment
of
costs
as
a
condition
of
compromise
probably
out
of
regard
for
the
interest
of
his
client
said
spalding
gravely
but
proceed
with
the
case
said
i
resumed
the
doctor
is
the
cost
of
these
five
how
much
for
the
fee
simple
of
the
lot
ai
worth
but
ninepence
he
replied
said
i
a
shilling
york
currency
said
he
and
threw
in
a
sucker
by
way
of
change
more
i
asked
of
the
old
cormorant
lawyer
he
replied
right
so
toss
us
overboard
and
be
quick
for
my
breath
is
getting
a
little
short
i
threw
them
over
one
at
a
time
the
old
fellow
last
and
as
he
slipped
from
my
hand
into
the
river
he
thrust
his
ugly
face
out
of
the
water
and
said
coolly
morning
when
you
come
our
way
again
said
i
a
i
remembered
how
i
in
over
on
long
lake
one
day
and
had
no
inclination
to
drop
in
to
the
lawrence
especially
when
there
are
old
lawyer
fishes
there
to
summon
me
for
assault
and
battery
on
a
trout
doctor
said
hank
martin
one
of
our
boatmen
who
had
been
listening
to
the
doctor
narrative
i
do
want
to
be
considered
or
sassy
but
i
like
to
know
how
much
of
these
kinds
of
stories
we
hired
folks
are
obligated
to
believe
well
replied
the
doctor
there
are
three
of
you
in
all
and
between
you
you
must
make
up
a
reasonable
case
as
spalding
would
say
of
faith
in
everything
you
may
hear
this
you
may
do
by
dividing
it
up
among
you
very
good
said
martin
with
imperturbable
gravity
i
only
wanted
a
fair
understanding
of
the
matter
on
the
start
chapter
a
frightened
animal
trolling
for
trout
the
boatman
story
we
sat
in
front
of
our
tents
enjoying
the
delightful
breeze
that
swept
quietly
over
the
lake
and
watching
the
stars
as
they
stole
out
from
the
depths
the
whippoorwill
piped
away
in
the
old
forests
and
the
frogs
bellowed
like
ten
thousand
buffaloes
along
the
shore
the
roar
of
their
hoarse
voices
went
rolling
over
the
lake
through
the
old
woods
and
surging
up
against
the
mountains
to
be
thrown
back
by
the
echoes
that
dwell
among
the
hills
we
had
knocked
the
ashes
from
our
pipes
and
were
about
retiring
to
our
tents
for
the
night
when
a
long
wake
in
the
water
across
the
line
of
the
moon
reflection
attracted
our
attention
it
was
evidently
made
by
some
animal
swimming
and
the
doctor
and
martin
started
in
pursuit
it
proved
to
be
a
deer
which
was
apparently
making
its
way
to
an
island
midway
across
the
lake
they
had
no
desire
to
slaughter
it
and
they
concluded
to
drive
it
ashore
where
we
were
they
headed
it
in
the
proper
direction
and
followed
the
terrified
animal
as
it
swam
for
life
towards
the
island
on
which
we
were
encamped
we
understood
their
purpose
and
sat
perfectly
silent
the
deer
struck
the
island
directly
in
front
of
our
tent
and
dashed
forward
in
wild
affright
right
through
the
midst
of
us
towards
the
thicket
in
our
rear
glad
to
be
rid
of
his
pursuers
on
the
water
as
he
bounded
past
us
we
sprang
up
and
shouted
and
if
ever
a
dumb
animal
was
astonished
it
was
that
deer
he
leaped
up
a
dozen
feet
into
the
air
bleated
out
in
the
extremity
of
his
terror
and
plunged
madly
forward
as
if
a
whole
legion
of
fiends
were
at
his
tail
the
stag
hounds
which
were
tied
to
a
sapling
by
their
fierce
baying
added
vigor
to
his
flight
we
heard
his
snort
at
every
bound
across
the
island
and
his
plunge
into
the
lake
on
the
other
side
in
the
morning
we
sent
forward
our
boatman
with
the
tents
and
baggage
to
an
island
on
the
upper
saranac
and
coasted
this
pleasant
little
lake
on
the
right
as
you
approach
the
head
is
a
deep
bay
skirted
by
a
natural
meadow
where
the
rank
wild
grass
and
the
pond
lilies
that
grow
along
the
shore
furnish
a
rich
pasture
for
the
deer
we
saw
several
feeding
quietly
like
sheep
on
the
little
plain
and
upon
the
lily
pads
in
the
edge
of
the
water
we
paddled
silently
to
within
a
dozen
rods
of
them
when
as
they
discovered
us
they
dashed
snorting
and
whistling
away
on
the
right
of
this
meadow
and
among
the
tall
forest
trees
are
great
boulders
which
piled
up
and
partly
obscured
by
the
undergrowth
resemble
from
the
lake
the
massive
ruins
of
some
ancient
fortification
we
landed
by
a
spring
which
came
bubbling
up
from
beneath
one
of
these
great
rocks
to
lunch
it
was
a
pleasant
spot
and
while
we
sat
there
dozens
of
small
birds
of
the
size
and
general
appearance
of
the
cuckoo
save
in
their
hooked
beaks
attracted
by
the
scent
of
our
cold
meats
came
hopping
tamely
about
on
the
lower
limbs
of
the
forest
trees
around
us
they
were
called
by
our
boatmen
meat
hawks
and
have
less
fear
of
man
than
any
wild
birds
that
i
have
ever
seen
we
crossed
the
carrying
place
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
around
the
rapids
in
which
distance
the
river
falls
some
sixty
feet
roaring
and
tumbling
down
ledges
and
boiling
in
mad
fury
around
boulders
we
entered
the
upper
saranac
at
the
hour
appointed
and
found
our
tents
pitched
and
a
dinner
of
venison
and
trout
awaiting
us
on
the
island
selected
for
our
encampment
as
the
sun
sank
behind
the
hills
the
breeze
died
away
and
the
lake
lay
without
a
ripple
around
as
so
calm
so
smooth
and
still
that
it
seemed
to
have
sunk
quietly
to
sleep
in
its
forest
bed
the
fish
were
jumping
in
every
direction
and
while
the
rest
of
us
sat
smoking
our
meerchaums
after
dinner
or
rather
supper
smith
rigged
his
trolling
rod
and
having
caught
half
a
dozen
minnows
he
with
martin
rowed
out
upon
the
water
to
troll
for
the
lake
trout
these
are
a
very
different
fish
from
the
speckled
trout
of
the
streams
and
rivers
they
had
none
of
the
golden
specks
of
the
latter
are
of
a
darker
hue
and
much
larger
they
are
dotted
with
brown
spots
like
freckles
upon
the
face
of
a
girl
they
are
shorter
too
in
proportion
to
their
weight
than
the
speckled
trout
they
are
caught
in
these
lakes
weighing
from
three
to
fifteen
pounds
and
instances
have
been
known
of
their
attaining
to
the
weight
of
five
and
twenty
it
is
an
exciting
sport
to
take
one
of
these
large
fellows
on
a
line
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
or
three
hundred
feet
in
length
they
play
beautifully
when
hooked
and
it
requires
a
good
deal
of
coolness
and
skill
to
land
them
safely
in
your
boat
a
trolling
rod
for
these
large
fish
should
be
much
stiffer
and
stronger
than
those
used
for
the
fly
on
the
rivers
and
streams
and
the
reel
should
be
stronger
and
higher
geared
than
the
common
fly
reel
three
hundred
feet
of
line
are
necessary
for
the
fish
if
he
is
a
large
one
will
sometimes
determine
upon
a
long
flight
and
it
will
not
do
to
exhaust
your
line
in
his
career
in
that
case
he
will
snap
it
like
a
an
english
bass
rod
is
the
best
and
with
such
and
a
large
triple
action
reel
the
largest
fish
of
these
lakes
may
be
secured
smith
had
trolled
scarcely
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
his
hook
was
struck
by
a
trout
and
then
commenced
a
struggle
that
was
pleasant
to
witness
no
sooner
had
the
fish
discovered
that
the
hook
was
in
his
jaw
than
away
he
dashed
towards
the
middle
of
the
lake
the
rod
was
bent
into
a
semicircle
but
the
game
was
fast
with
the
butt
firm
between
his
knees
and
his
thumb
pressing
the
reel
the
sportsman
gave
him
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
of
line
when
his
efforts
began
to
relax
and
as
smith
began
to
reel
him
in
a
moment
of
dead
pull
a
holding
back
like
an
obstinate
mule
occurred
the
trout
was
slowly
towed
in
the
direction
of
the
boat
then
as
if
maddened
by
the
force
which
impelled
him
he
dashed
furiously
forward
the
reel
answering
to
his
movements
and
the
line
always
taught
he
rose
to
the
surface
leaping
clear
from
the
water
shaking
his
head
furiously
as
if
to
throw
loose
the
fastenings
from
his
jaw
failing
in
this
down
he
plunged
fifty
feet
straight
towards
the
bottom
making
the
reel
hiss
by
his
mad
efforts
to
escape
still
the
line
was
taught
pressing
always
towing
him
towards
the
boat
at
every
relaxation
at
last
he
rose
to
the
surface
panting
and
exhausted
permitting
himself
to
be
towed
almost
without
an
effort
to
within
twenty
feet
of
his
captors
when
he
saw
them
all
his
fright
and
all
his
energies
too
seemed
to
be
restored
and
away
he
dashed
sciving
through
the
water
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
out
into
the
lake
but
the
hook
was
in
his
jaw
and
he
could
not
escape
after
half
an
hour
of
beautiful
and
exciting
play
he
surrendered
or
was
drowned
and
smith
lifted
him
with
his
landing
net
a
splendid
trout
into
his
boat
by
this
time
the
shadows
of
twilight
were
gathering
over
the
lake
and
he
came
ashore
a
proud
man
was
smith
as
he
lifted
that
fish
from
the
boat
and
handed
it
over
to
the
cook
to
be
dressed
for
breakfast
and
though
we
had
seen
the
whole
performance
from
our
tents
yet
he
gave
us
in
glowing
and
graphic
detail
the
history
of
his
taking
that
trout
captain
said
hank
wood
who
had
been
quietly
whitling
out
a
new
set
of
tent
pins
addressing
smith
you
had
a
good
time
of
it
with
that
trout
but
it
was
nothing
to
an
adventer
of
mine
with
an
old
on
this
lake
five
year
ago
this
summer
how
was
that
inquired
smith
and
we
all
gathered
around
to
hear
hank
wood
story
i
do
know
how
it
is
he
began
as
he
seated
himself
on
the
log
in
front
of
the
tents
with
one
leg
hanging
down
and
the
other
drawn
up
with
the
heel
of
his
boot
caught
on
a
projection
in
the
bark
his
knee
almost
even
with
his
nose
and
his
fingers
locked
across
his
shin
i
do
know
exactly
why
but
the
catching
of
that
trout
makes
me
think
of
an
adventer
i
had
on
this
very
lake
five
year
ago
this
summer
it
is
curious
how
things
will
lay
around
in
a
man
memory
every
now
and
then
startin
up
and
presentin
themselves
ready
to
be
talked
about
reeled
off
as
it
were
and
then
how
quietly
they
coil
themselves
away
to
lay
there
till
some
new
sight
or
sound
or
idea
or
feelin
stirs
into
life
and
they
come
up
again
fresh
and
plain
as
ever
some
people
talk
about
forgotten
things
but
i
do
believe
that
any
matter
that
gets
fairly
anchored
in
a
man
mind
can
ever
be
forgotten
until
age
has
broken
the
power
of
memory
it
is
there
and
will
stay
there
in
spite
of
the
ten
thousand
other
things
that
get
piled
in
on
top
of
it
and
some
day
it
will
come
popping
out
like
a
cork
just
as
good
and
distinct
as
new
but
i
was
talkin
about
an
adventer
i
had
with
a
trout
five
year
ago
here
on
the
upper
saranac
i
was
livin
over
on
the
then
and
came
over
to
these
parts
to
spend
a
week
or
so
and
lay
in
a
store
of
jerked
venison
and
trout
for
the
winter
i
brought
along
a
bag
of
salt
and
two
or
three
kegs
that
would
hold
a
hundred
pound
or
so
apiece
and
filled
too
with
as
beautiful
fellows
as
you
see
in
a
day
drive
the
trout
were
plentier
than
they
are
now
they
been
fished
by
all
the
sportin
men
in
creation
and
they
had
a
chance
to
grow
to
their
nateral
size
you
would
in
them
days
row
across
any
of
these
lakes
in
the
trollin
season
without
hitchin
on
to
an
eight
or
ten
and
now
and
then
to
a
wal
i
was
on
the
upper
saranac
up
towards
the
head
of
the
lake
ten
or
twelve
miles
from
here
trollin
with
an
line
about
as
big
as
a
pipe
stem
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
and
a
hook
to
match
nobody
in
them
days
of
sich
contrivances
as
reels
and
you
held
your
lines
in
your
fingers
and
when
you
hooked
a
fish
you
drew
him
in
hand
over
hand
in
a
human
way
it
was
in
the
latter
part
of
june
and
the
way
the
black
flies
swarmed
along
the
shore
was
a
thing
to
set
anybody
a
scratchin
that
happened
to
be
around
it
was
a
clear
still
mornin
and
the
sun
as
he
went
up
into
the
heavens
blazed
away
and
as
he
walked
across
the
sky
if
he
did
pour
down
his
heat
like
a
furnace
i
would
say
so
i
had
tolerable
good
luck
in
the
forenoon
and
landed
on
a
rocky
island
to
cook
dinner
i
made
such
a
meal
as
a
hungry
man
makes
when
he
out
all
alone
fishin
and
huntin
about
these
waters
and
started
off
across
the
lake
with
my
trollin
line
to
the
length
of
a
hundred
feet
or
more
draggin
through
the
water
behind
me
the
breeze
had
freshened
a
little
and
my
boat
drifted
about
fast
enough
for
trollin
and
feelin
a
little
drowsy
i
tied
the
end
of
the
line
to
the
cleets
across
the
knees
of
the
boat
and
lay
down
in
the
bottom
with
my
hand
out
over
the
side
holdin
the
line
i
had
laid
there
long
when
i
felt
a
twitch
as
if
something
mighty
big
was
medlin
with
the
other
end
of
the
string
i
started
up
and
undertook
to
pull
in
but
you
might
as
well
undertake
to
drag
an
elephant
with
a
thread
i
could
move
him
a
hair
pretty
soon
the
boat
began
to
move
up
the
lake
in
a
way
i
did
at
all
like
at
first
it
went
may
be
three
miles
an
hour
then
five
ten
twenty
forty
sixty
miles
the
hour
round
and
round
the
lake
as
if
hurled
along
by
a
million
of
locomotives
we
went
skiving
around
among
the
islands
into
the
bays
along
the
shore
away
out
across
the
lake
crossing
and
in
every
direction
and
if
there
a
place
about
this
lake
we
did
visit
i
should
like
to
have
somebody
tell
me
where
it
is
you
may
think
it
made
my
hair
stand
out
some
to
find
myself
about
like
a
streak
of
chain
lightnin
and
to
see
the
trees
and
rocks
flyin
like
mad
the
other
way
i
tried
to
untie
the
line
but
it
was
drawn
into
a
knot
so
hard
that
the
old
nick
himself
could
move
it
i
looked
for
my
knife
to
cut
it
but
it
had
somehow
got
overboard
in
our
flight
besides
flyin
about
at
the
rate
of
sixty
mile
an
hour
kept
a
fellow
pretty
busy
holdin
on
keepin
his
place
in
the
boat
after
an
hour
or
two
we
came
to
a
pause
and
the
old
feller
that
was
towin
me
about
walked
up
to
the
surface
and
stickin
his
head
out
of
the
water
mornin
says
he
in
a
very
perlite
sort
of
way
mornin
says
i
back
again
goes
it
says
he
right
says
i
this
way
and
i
take
the
hook
out
of
your
gums
you
for
nothing
says
he
and
he
opened
his
month
like
the
entrance
to
a
railroad
tunnel
and
blame
me
if
he
had
taken
a
double
hitch
of
the
line
around
his
eye
tooth
while
the
hook
hung
harmless
beside
his
jaw
a
little
business
down
in
the
lower
lake
says
he
must
be
movin
and
away
he
bolted
like
a
steam
engine
down
the
lake
when
he
straightened
up
my
hat
flew
more
than
sixty
yards
behind
me
and
the
way
i
came
down
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
was
anything
but
pleasant
away
we
tore
down
towards
the
outlet
the
boat
cuttin
and
plowin
through
the
water
pilin
it
up
in
great
furrows
ten
feet
high
on
each
side
there
is
as
you
know
sixty
feet
fall
between
the
upper
saranac
and
round
lake
and
the
river
goes
boilin
and
roarin
tumblin
and
heavin
down
the
rapids
and
over
the
rocks
pitchin
in
some
places
square
down
a
dozen
feet
among
the
boulders
no
sensible
man
would
think
of
travellin
that
road
in
a
little
craft
like
mine
unless
he
made
up
his
mind
to
see
how
it
would
seem
to
be
drowned
or
smashed
to
pieces
agin
the
rocks
but
right
down
the
rapids
we
went
swifter
than
an
eagle
in
his
stoop
down
over
the
eddies
down
over
the
foamin
surge
down
the
perpendicular
falls
as
if
the
old
nick
himself
was
kickin
us
on
end
how
we
got
down
i
undertake
to
say
but
when
i
got
breath
and
looked
out
over
the
side
of
the
boat
i
saw
the
old
woods
and
rocks
along
the
shore
below
the
falls
rushin
up
stream
like
a
racehorse
wal
we
entered
round
lake
crossed
it
in
five
minutes
and
down
the
river
we
rushed
over
the
little
falls
at
a
bound
and
into
the
lower
saranac
i
got
a
little
used
to
it
by
this
time
and
though
it
was
mighty
hard
work
to
catch
my
breath
in
such
a
wind
as
we
made
by
our
flight
yet
i
managed
to
sit
up
and
look
around
me
it
was
curious
to
see
how
the
islands
on
the
lower
saranac
danced
about
and
how
the
shores
ran
away
behind
while
i
was
looking
at
and
how
the
forest
trees
dodged
and
whirled
and
jumped
about
one
another
as
we
tore
along
after
tearin
about
the
lake
a
spell
we
came
to
something
like
a
halt
and
old
mossyback
stuck
his
head
out
of
water
and
openin
his
great
glassy
eyes
like
the
moon
in
a
mist
do
you
like
that
said
he
in
a
jeerin
sort
of
way
right
said
i
it
while
you
young
i
did
care
about
appearin
skeered
or
uneasy
but
i
have
given
a
couple
of
month
wages
just
then
to
have
been
on
dry
land
said
he
guess
we
be
gittin
towards
home
and
away
he
started
for
the
upper
saranac
and
up
the
river
across
round
lake
and
right
up
over
the
rapids
we
went
two
or
three
times
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
was
a
goner
as
the
water
piled
up
around
me
along
over
the
falls
but
somehow
our
very
speed
made
our
boat
glance
upward
at
such
times
and
skim
along
the
surface
like
a
duck
we
went
boundin
from
hillock
to
hillock
on
the
mad
waters
till
we
entered
the
broad
lake
and
went
skiving
about
again
among
the
islands
all
at
once
he
seemed
to
take
a
notion
to
go
down
towards
the
bottom
so
shortenin
the
line
some
fifty
foot
or
more
he
hoisted
his
great
tail
straight
up
towards
the
sky
and
down
he
went
the
boat
standing
up
on
end
and
somehow
the
waters
did
seem
to
close
above
us
so
rapid
was
our
descent
it
was
tight
work
as
you
may
guess
to
hold
on
under
such
circumstances
but
i
managed
to
keep
my
place
how
deep
we
went
i
wont
undertake
to
say
but
this
much
is
quite
sartin
we
went
down
so
far
that
i
could
see
out
at
the
hole
we
went
in
at
there
are
some
mighty
big
fish
away
down
in
them
parts
you
may
bet
your
life
on
that
trout
that
it
would
be
pleasant
to
handle
we
started
for
daylight
again
the
fish
had
to
stand
out
of
the
way
as
we
rushed
like
an
express
train
towards
the
surface
them
that
did
we
made
a
smash
of
one
bull
head
i
remember
about
twice
as
long
as
one
of
our
boats
was
quick
enough
the
bow
of
the
boat
struck
him
about
in
the
middle
and
cut
him
in
two
like
a
knife
one
old
trout
seemed
to
have
made
up
his
mind
for
a
fight
and
he
chased
us
more
than
two
miles
with
his
jaws
open
like
a
great
pair
of
clamps
as
if
he
a
mind
to
swallow
us
boat
and
all
and
from
the
size
of
the
openin
i
bold
to
say
he
a
done
it
too
if
he
have
caught
us
but
as
we
rounded
an
island
he
run
head
foremost
jam
against
a
rock
that
kind
o
stunned
him
and
he
gave
in
wal
after
we
got
to
the
surface
the
trout
that
was
towin
me
seemed
to
let
on
an
extra
amount
of
steam
for
a
mile
or
so
and
let
me
say
the
way
we
went
was
a
caution
i
travelled
on
the
cars
in
my
day
when
they
made
every
thing
gee
again
but
that
kind
o
was
a
circumstance
to
the
way
we
tore
along
the
water
rose
up
on
either
hand
more
than
twenty
feet
and
went
roarin
and
tumblin
and
hissin
as
if
everything
was
goin
to
smash
all
at
once
the
line
was
thrown
loose
and
the
boat
went
straight
ahead
bows
on
to
one
of
the
small
islands
up
towards
the
head
of
the
lake
and
when
she
struck
i
went
through
the
air
eend
over
eend
clear
across
the
island
more
than
fifteen
rods
into
the
lake
on
the
other
side
human
nater
could
stand
all
that
so
startin
up
i
found
that
while
i
been
layin
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
the
wind
had
ris
and
was
blowin
a
stiff
gale
the
boat
had
drifted
across
the
lake
and
had
struck
broadside
agin
the
shore
and
the
waves
were
makin
a
clean
breach
into
her
at
every
surge
i
soon
got
her
head
on
to
the
waves
and
feelin
something
mighty
lively
at
the
other
eend
of
the
line
hauled
in
a
pshaw
exclaimed
one
of
the
audience
you
only
been
telling
a
dream
in
this
long
yarn
we
been
listening
to
wal
replied
the
narrator
some
people
that
i
told
it
to
have
suspicioned
that
it
might
be
so
but
every
thing
about
it
seemed
so
nateral
that
i
almost
ready
to
make
my
affidavy
that
it
was
sober
fact
one
thing
however
i
always
had
my
doubts
about
i
never
fully
believed
that
was
actually
pitched
over
that
i
hearn
it
said
that
when
a
man
has
eaten
a
hearty
dinner
and
goes
to
sleep
with
the
hot
sun
pourin
right
down
on
him
he
apt
to
see
and
hear
a
good
many
strange
things
before
he
wakes
up
may
be
it
was
so
with
me
chapter
vi
the
upper
saranac
spectacle
ponds
the
accusation
and
the
defence
an
octogenarian
smoker
we
spent
the
next
day
in
rowing
about
the
upper
saranac
exploring
its
beautiful
bays
and
islands
we
took
as
many
trout
in
trolling
occasionally
as
we
needed
for
dinner
and
supper
it
became
an
established
law
among
us
that
we
should
kill
no
more
game
or
fish
than
we
needed
for
supplies
whatever
their
abundance
or
our
temptation
might
be
it
required
some
to
observe
this
law
but
we
kept
it
with
tolerable
strictness
there
were
times
when
we
had
a
large
supply
of
both
venison
and
fish
but
there
were
seven
men
of
us
in
all
and
we
could
despose
of
a
good
deal
of
flesh
and
fish
in
the
hours
we
had
sent
our
boat
with
the
luggage
across
the
indian
carrying
place
a
path
of
a
mile
through
the
forest
to
the
spectacle
ponds
three
little
lakes
from
which
a
stream
known
as
stony
brook
rises
this
stream
is
navigable
for
small
boats
like
ours
five
miles
to
the
rackett
river
these
lakes
contain
from
a
hundred
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
acres
each
at
the
head
of
the
upper
pond
is
a
beautiful
cold
spring
near
which
upon
crossing
the
carrying
place
at
evening
we
found
our
tents
pitched
we
arrived
here
about
sundown
somewhat
wearied
with
our
day
excursion
and
with
appetites
fully
equal
to
a
plentiful
supper
which
was
soon
in
readiness
for
us
you
are
getting
me
into
a
bad
habit
spoiling
my
morals
in
a
physical
sense
said
smith
addressing
us
as
we
sat
after
supper
around
our
i
find
myself
taking
to
the
pipe
out
here
in
these
old
woods
with
a
relish
i
never
have
at
home
it
seems
to
agree
with
me
here
and
i
expect
by
the
time
i
get
back
to
civilization
i
shall
be
as
great
a
smoker
as
the
doctor
or
spalding
if
i
do
i
shall
have
to
pay
for
it
by
indigestion
and
hypochondria
things
that
you
of
the
fat
kine
know
nothing
about
well
replied
the
doctor
you
will
only
have
to
call
on
me
as
you
did
last
month
and
then
send
for
spalding
to
draw
your
will
as
you
did
the
next
day
when
you
were
as
well
as
i
am
excepting
that
kink
in
your
head
about
your
going
to
die
why
the
truth
is
retorted
smith
i
had
made
up
my
mind
after
twelve
hours
consideration
to
take
the
medicine
you
left
and
i
appeal
to
h
here
if
it
was
after
that
anything
more
than
a
reasonable
precaution
to
be
prepared
for
any
contingency
that
might
happen
your
medicines
doctor
and
the
testamentary
disposition
of
a
man
worldly
effects
are
very
natural
associations
very
well
said
the
doctor
you
send
for
me
again
in
a
month
after
our
return
and
in
that
case
it
may
be
that
the
money
you
paid
spalding
for
drawing
your
will
will
not
have
been
thrown
away
but
in
regard
to
the
use
of
the
pipe
i
propose
that
we
call
upon
spalding
for
a
legal
opinion
or
an
argument
in
its
favor
it
his
business
to
defend
criminals
and
i
file
an
accusation
against
smoking
generally
excepting
however
from
the
indictments
the
use
of
the
pipe
as
in
some
sort
a
necessity
on
all
such
excursions
as
ours
i
shall
not
undertake
said
spalding
to
enter
into
a
labored
defence
of
the
use
of
tobacco
in
any
form
i
only
move
for
a
mitigation
of
punishment
and
will
state
the
circumstances
upon
which
i
base
my
appeal
to
the
clemency
of
the
court
the
exception
in
the
indictment
enables
me
to
avoid
the
plea
of
necessity
which
i
should
have
interposed
founded
upon
a
huge
forest
meal
and
the
abundance
as
well
as
impertinence
of
the
musquitoes
of
these
woods
i
called
the
other
day
upon
a
venerable
friend
and
client
who
is
travelling
the
down
hill
of
life
quietly
and
though
with
the
present
summer
he
will
have
accomplished
his
three
score
years
and
ten
his
voice
is
as
cheerful
and
his
heart
as
young
as
they
were
decades
ago
when
his
manhood
was
in
the
glory
and
strength
of
its
prime
i
found
him
sitting
in
his
great
smoking
his
accustomed
pipe
reading
the
evening
papers
he
seemed
to
be
so
calm
and
happy
as
the
smoke
went
wreathing
up
from
his
lips
that
i
could
not
for
the
moment
refrain
from
envying
the
calmness
and
repose
which
were
visible
all
around
him
he
has
smoked
his
morning
and
evening
pipe
in
his
quiet
way
for
nearly
half
a
century
when
engaged
in
the
active
business
of
life
struggling
with
its
cares
and
fighting
its
battles
he
always
took
half
an
hour
in
the
morning
and
as
long
at
evening
to
smoke
his
pipe
and
read
the
news
of
the
day
he
scarcely
ever
when
at
home
under
any
pressure
of
circumstances
omitted
these
two
half
hours
of
repose
or
as
his
excellent
wife
used
to
say
of
she
passed
to
her
rest
years
ago
leaving
behind
her
the
pleasant
odor
of
a
good
name
a
memory
cherished
by
all
who
knew
her
men
denounce
the
use
of
tobacco
and
i
do
not
quarrel
with
them
for
doing
so
say
that
it
is
a
vile
and
a
filthy
habit
be
it
so
i
will
not
now
stop
to
deny
it
say
that
it
is
bad
for
the
constitution
ruinous
to
the
health
be
it
so
i
will
not
gainsay
it
still
i
never
see
an
old
man
seated
in
his
great
arm
chair
with
his
grandchildren
playing
around
him
smoking
his
pipe
and
enjoying
its
to
him
pleasant
perfume
its
soothing
influences
without
regarding
that
same
pipe
as
an
institution
which
i
would
hardly
be
willing
to
banish
entirely
from
the
world
there
is
a
good
deal
of
philosophy
too
in
a
pipe
if
one
will
but
take
the
trouble
to
study
it
great
subjects
for
moralizing
much
food
for
reflection
and
all
this
outside
of
the
physical
enjoyment
the
soothing
influences
of
a
quiet
pipe
when
the
day
is
drawing
to
a
close
and
its
cares
require
some
gentle
force
to
banish
them
away
it
does
not
weaken
the
power
of
thought
nor
stultify
the
brain
it
quiets
the
nerves
makes
a
man
look
in
charity
upon
the
world
and
to
judge
with
a
chastened
lenity
the
shortcomings
of
his
neighbors
it
reconciles
him
to
his
lot
and
sends
him
to
his
pillow
or
about
his
labors
with
a
calm
deliberate
cheerfulness
very
desirable
to
those
who
come
under
the
law
that
requires
people
to
earn
their
bread
by
the
sweat
of
their
brow
i
said
there
is
a
good
deal
of
philosophy
in
a
pipe
and
i
repeat
it
who
can
see
the
smoke
go
wreathing
and
curling
upward
from
his
lips
in
all
sorts
of
fantastic
shapes
spreading
out
thinner
and
thinner
till
it
fades
away
and
is
lost
among
the
invisible
things
of
the
air
without
saying
to
himself
are
the
visions
of
youth
such
the
hopes
the
grand
schemes
of
life
looming
up
in
beautiful
distinctness
before
the
mind
eye
growing
fainter
and
fainter
as
life
wears
away
and
then
disappearing
forever
such
are
the
things
of
this
life
beautiful
as
they
appear
unsubstantial
shadows
all
and
then
as
the
fire
consumes
the
weed
exhausting
itself
upon
the
substance
which
feeds
it
burning
lower
and
lower
till
it
goes
out
for
lack
of
aliment
who
will
not
be
reminded
of
life
itself
the
animated
form
the
body
instinct
with
vitality
changing
and
changing
as
time
sweeps
along
till
the
spirit
that
gave
it
vigor
and
comeliness
and
power
and
beauty
is
called
away
and
it
becomes
at
last
mere
dust
and
ashes
and
then
again
when
the
pipe
itself
falls
from
the
teeth
or
the
table
or
the
mantel
or
the
shelf
as
fall
it
surely
will
sooner
or
later
and
is
broken
and
the
fragments
are
thrown
out
of
the
window
or
swept
out
at
the
door
who
can
fail
to
see
in
this
the
type
of
life
closing
scene
the
body
broken
by
disease
and
death
carried
away
and
hidden
in
the
earth
to
remain
among
the
useless
rubbish
of
the
past
to
be
seen
no
more
forever
yes
yes
there
is
a
great
deal
of
philosophy
in
a
pipe
if
people
will
take
pains
to
study
it
i
have
a
pleasant
time
of
it
once
or
twice
a
year
with
an
old
gentleman
living
away
in
the
country
one
whom
memory
calls
up
from
the
dim
and
shadowy
twilight
of
my
earliest
recollections
as
a
tall
stalwart
man
already
the
head
of
a
family
with
little
children
around
him
those
who
were
then
little
children
have
grown
up
to
be
men
and
women
and
have
drifted
away
upon
the
currents
of
life
themselves
fathers
and
mothers
with
grey
hairs
gathering
upon
their
heads
i
visit
this
venerable
philosopher
in
his
hearty
and
green
old
age
every
summer
i
see
him
now
in
my
mind
eye
sitting
under
the
spreading
branches
of
the
trees
planted
by
himself
half
a
century
ago
which
cast
their
shadows
upon
the
pleasant
lawn
in
front
of
his
dwelling
discussing
politics
morals
history
religion
philosophy
recounting
anecdotes
of
the
early
settlement
of
the
county
of
which
he
was
a
pioneer
and
i
see
how
calmly
and
deliberately
he
smokes
while
he
calls
up
old
memories
from
the
shadowy
past
discoursing
wisely
of
the
present
or
speaking
prophetically
of
the
future
i
saw
him
last
in
july
of
the
past
year
and
he
seemed
to
have
changed
in
nothing
he
had
not
grown
older
in
outward
seeming
his
heart
was
as
warm
and
genial
as
it
was
long
long
ago
and
cheerfulness
calm
and
chastened
marked
as
it
had
for
years
the
conversation
of
a
man
who
felt
that
his
mission
in
life
was
accomplished
said
he
addressing
me
as
a
new
thought
seemed
to
strike
him
head
is
growing
grey
i
never
noticed
it
before
it
is
almost
as
white
as
mine
well
well
he
continued
as
he
tapped
the
thumb
nail
of
his
left
hand
with
the
inverted
bowl
of
his
pipe
knocking
the
ashes
from
it
as
he
spoke
well
it
wo
be
long
until
we
will
have
smoked
our
last
pipe
mine
at
least
will
soon
be
broken
but
what
of
that
years
is
a
long
time
to
live
in
this
world
i
have
had
my
share
of
life
and
of
the
good
pertaining
to
it
and
shall
have
no
right
to
complain
when
my
pipe
is
broken
and
its
ashes
scattered
such
was
the
philosophy
of
an
almost
octogenarian
smoker
i
move
for
a
suspension
of
sentence
said
smith
spalding
defence
of
the
weed
induces
me
to
withdraw
the
indictment
against
it
leaving
punishment
only
for
the
excessive
use
of
it
the
motion
was
carried
unanimously
and
by
way
of
confirming
the
decision
we
all
refilled
our
pipes
and
smoked
till
the
stars
looked
down
in
their
brightness
from
the
fathomless
depths
of
the
sky
chapter
vii
kinks
dirty
dogs
the
barking
dog
that
was
found
dead
in
the
yard
the
dog
that
barked
himself
to
death
the
hallucinations
of
smith
said
spalding
after
we
had
settled
the
matter
of
the
pipes
and
were
enjoying
a
fresh
pull
at
the
weed
as
described
by
the
doctor
remind
me
of
a
slight
attack
of
fever
which
i
had
some
months
ago
and
from
which
i
recovered
partly
through
the
aid
of
the
doctor
medicine
and
partly
through
the
kindness
of
a
young
friend
of
mine
and
of
the
strange
as
you
call
them
which
got
into
my
head
between
the
fever
and
the
doctor
opiates
things
were
strangely
mixed
up
the
real
and
the
unreal
grouped
and
mingled
in
a
manner
that
gave
to
all
the
just
proportions
and
appearance
of
sober
actualities
i
remember
them
as
distinctly
and
they
made
as
deep
and
abiding
impression
upon
my
mind
as
if
i
had
seen
them
all
they
are
impressed
as
palpably
and
indelibly
upon
my
memory
now
as
any
actual
events
of
my
life
well
said
the
doctor
suppose
you
give
us
one
of
these
while
our
pipes
are
being
smoked
out
as
an
to
send
us
all
to
sleep
be
it
understood
then
spalding
began
that
i
like
dogs
in
a
general
way
they
are
plain
dealing
honest
trusty
folk
in
the
aggregate
albeit
there
are
what
tom
benton
calls
dogs
these
however
are
mostly
human
canines
dogs
that
walk
on
two
legs
and
wear
clothes
such
curs
i
like
but
there
are
such
and
they
may
be
seen
and
heard
barking
and
snarling
and
snapping
in
their
envy
at
honest
peoples
heels
every
day
let
them
bark
benton
was
right
they
are
dogs
but
a
dog
that
looks
you
honestly
and
frankly
in
the
face
that
stands
by
his
master
and
friend
in
all
times
of
trial
in
sorrow
as
in
joy
in
adversity
as
in
prosperity
in
dark
days
as
in
bright
days
always
cheerful
always
sincere
earnest
and
truthful
and
so
that
his
kindness
be
met
always
happy
i
like
he
is
your
true
nobility
of
nature
below
the
human
but
there
of
low
degree
dogs
of
neither
genial
instinct
nor
breeding
senseless
animals
that
belie
the
noble
nature
of
their
species
are
living
libels
upon
their
kind
there
was
one
of
these
over
against
my
rooms
at
the
time
of
the
sickness
i
speak
of
i
say
for
thanks
to
the
fates
he
is
among
the
things
that
have
been
he
belongs
to
history
has
been
wiped
out
he
was
a
barking
dog
when
the
moon
was
in
the
sky
he
barked
at
the
moon
when
only
the
stars
shone
out
he
barked
at
the
stars
when
clouds
shut
in
both
moon
and
stars
he
barked
at
the
clouds
and
when
the
darkness
was
so
deep
and
black
as
to
obscure
even
the
clouds
he
barked
at
the
darkness
through
all
the
long
night
he
barked
barked
barked
it
was
not
a
bark
of
defiance
nor
of
alarm
nor
of
astonishment
nor
of
warning
it
was
not
a
note
of
danger
breaking
the
hush
of
midnight
saying
that
thieves
were
abroad
that
murder
was
on
its
stealthy
mission
or
that
the
wolf
was
on
the
walk
it
was
a
senseless
monotonous
idiotic
bow
wow
nothing
more
nothing
less
all
monday
night
as
i
lay
tossing
upon
a
bed
of
pain
when
fever
was
coursing
through
my
veins
and
every
pulse
went
plunging
like
a
steam
engine
from
the
gorged
heart
to
every
extremity
and
my
brain
was
like
molten
lead
i
heard
that
terrible
bark
it
was
my
evil
genius
my
destiny
it
mingled
in
every
feverish
dream
became
the
embodiment
of
every
vision
i
measured
the
periods
of
its
recurrence
by
the
clock
that
stands
in
the
corner
of
our
room
i
counted
the
tickings
of
its
silence
and
i
counted
the
tickings
of
its
continuance
every
swing
of
the
pendulum
became
a
distinct
period
of
existence
minutes
hours
were
nothing
tickings
i
said
and
that
bow
wow
will
be
heard
again
fifteen
tickings
i
said
and
it
will
cease
and
so
i
went
on
until
the
hours
seemed
to
spread
out
into
a
boundless
ocean
of
time
that
dog
somehow
became
mixed
up
with
that
old
family
clock
that
stood
in
the
corner
i
heard
him
scratching
and
climbing
up
among
the
weights
writhing
and
twisting
his
way
among
the
machinery
till
there
looking
out
through
the
face
of
that
old
family
clock
distinct
and
palpable
as
the
sun
at
noonday
or
the
moon
in
a
cloudless
night
i
saw
the
ogre
head
of
that
dog
his
great
glassy
fishy
eyes
his
half
drooping
half
erect
ears
his
slavering
jaws
and
as
he
gazed
in
a
stupid
meaningless
stare
upon
me
uttered
his
everlasting
bow
wow
tell
me
that
the
room
was
dark
that
not
a
ray
of
light
penetrated
the
closed
doors
or
the
curtained
windows
what
of
that
that
dog
head
i
repeat
was
there
i
saw
it
if
i
ever
saw
the
sun
the
moon
or
the
bright
stars
i
saw
it
staring
at
me
through
all
the
gloom
all
the
thick
darkness
and
i
heard
its
terrible
bow
wow
out
i
shouted
in
horror
the
matter
cried
my
wife
springing
up
in
an
ecstasy
of
terror
out
that
dog
i
replied
dog
she
inquired
i
replied
dog
there
in
the
clock
with
his
great
staring
glassy
eyes
drive
him
out
she
lighted
the
gas
and
as
it
flashed
up
there
stood
the
old
clock
the
pendulum
swung
back
and
forth
the
ticking
went
on
and
its
white
face
looked
out
in
calm
serenity
but
the
dog
was
gone
it
was
all
natural
as
life
the
lighting
of
the
gas
had
frightened
the
cur
back
to
his
yard
and
as
the
tick
ceased
his
bow
wow
was
heard
again
and
it
lasted
while
the
pendulum
swung
back
and
forth
just
fifteen
times
i
took
a
cooling
draft
and
counted
in
feverish
agony
and
fifteen
till
the
daylight
came
creeping
in
at
the
windows
filling
with
sepulchral
greyness
the
room
the
barking
ceased
and
i
slept
only
to
dream
of
snarling
curs
and
dogs
for
an
hour
through
all
tuesday
i
lay
tossing
with
pain
fever
was
in
every
pulse
my
brain
was
seething
burning
lava
i
thought
and
dreamed
of
nothing
but
mangy
curs
and
dogs
the
night
gathered
again
and
the
rumbling
of
the
carriages
and
the
thousand
voices
that
break
the
stillness
of
a
thronged
city
died
away
into
silence
the
lights
were
extinguished
but
again
that
horrible
bark
bark
broke
the
hush
of
midnight
and
worse
than
all
the
quickened
senses
of
fever
heard
it
answered
from
away
over
on
arbor
hill
and
again
away
up
in
state
street
and
yet
again
over
in
lydius
and
still
again
away
down
by
the
river
the
east
the
north
the
west
and
the
south
had
a
voice
and
it
was
all
concentrated
in
a
ceaseless
senseless
idiotic
bark
i
counted
again
the
tickings
of
the
clock
and
each
swing
of
the
pendulum
ended
in
a
bark
as
i
lay
there
in
the
silence
and
desolation
the
restless
tossing
anguish
of
fever
those
dogs
gathered
together
in
state
at
the
crossing
of
eagle
just
above
my
and
barked
they
came
under
my
windows
and
barked
they
looked
in
between
the
curtains
and
barked
they
came
into
my
room
and
there
on
the
sofa
on
the
on
the
table
on
the
mantelpiece
on
the
ottoman
on
the
stove
and
on
the
top
of
the
old
clock
was
a
dog
and
each
barked
and
barked
i
saw
them
all
through
the
darkness
plain
as
if
it
were
noonday
they
were
dogs
filthy
brutes
mangy
curs
all
and
there
they
sat
and
barked
at
the
clock
barked
at
the
mirror
at
the
stove
barked
at
one
another
and
at
me
with
the
same
monotonous
meaningless
idiotic
bow
wow
as
of
old
i
had
two
rifles
and
a
sitting
in
the
corner
of
the
parlor
adjoining
our
the
gifts
of
valued
friends
my
wife
wearied
with
the
day
watching
had
sunk
into
slumber
on
the
bed
beside
me
i
woke
her
gently
no
noise
i
said
bring
me
the
guns
do
it
carefully
on
earth
do
you
want
of
the
guns
she
inquired
in
alarm
you
see
those
infernal
dogs
i
answered
me
the
guns
and
i
make
short
work
with
the
howling
curs
husband
said
she
are
no
dogs
here
and
as
she
lighted
the
gas
the
curs
vanished
away
but
i
saw
them
in
the
darkness
it
was
only
when
the
light
flashed
through
the
room
that
they
fled
from
it
and
i
heard
them
barking
in
response
to
each
other
through
all
the
long
night
till
the
dawn
crept
over
the
world
again
years
ago
i
saved
a
boy
from
the
meshes
of
the
law
in
which
his
evil
ways
had
involved
him
i
admonished
him
of
the
end
towards
which
he
was
hastening
i
showed
him
that
the
path
he
was
treading
led
to
destruction
and
he
left
it
as
he
said
forever
he
apprenticed
himself
to
a
useful
trade
and
is
now
an
intelligent
mechanic
out
of
his
time
an
industrious
sober
youth
of
two
and
twenty
supporting
by
his
industry
his
mother
and
sister
in
comfort
and
respectability
he
heard
of
my
sickness
and
on
wednesday
morning
called
to
see
me
proffering
his
services
as
a
nurse
and
watchman
prompted
by
gratitude
for
the
past
i
declined
his
kindness
for
the
present
as
i
told
him
casually
of
the
dog
whose
midnight
barking
was
killing
me
he
called
again
on
thursday
morning
the
barking
had
ceased
he
inquired
if
i
had
been
troubled
with
the
yelping
of
that
senseless
cur
and
i
answered
truly
that
i
had
not
that
i
had
slept
soundly
and
woke
with
a
softened
pulse
and
a
cooled
brain
said
he
thought
you
would
rest
easier
i
looked
into
the
yard
as
i
came
along
and
saw
a
dead
dog
lying
there
i
thought
may
be
he
had
barked
himself
to
death
i
did
not
at
the
time
take
in
the
full
meaning
the
hidden
import
of
his
words
i
dropped
away
into
slumber
and
dreamed
of
the
dog
that
barked
himself
to
death
i
saw
him
vanish
by
piecemeal
at
each
successive
bark
until
nothing
but
his
jaws
were
left
and
as
his
last
bark
was
uttered
these
too
vanished
away
and
then
all
was
still
i
awoke
and
thought
that
a
dose
of
or
a
taste
of
strychnine
administered
with
a
tempting
bit
of
cold
steak
or
a
piece
of
fresh
lamb
or
a
bone
of
mutton
carefully
dropped
in
his
way
might
have
aided
the
operation
be
that
as
it
may
whatever
of
debt
may
have
existed
between
my
young
friend
and
myself
for
past
kind
it
is
all
wiped
out
by
the
news
he
brought
me
that
a
dog
lay
in
the
yard
over
the
way

stony
brook
a
good
time
with
the
trout
rackett
river
lake
a
question
asked
and
answered
the
next
morning
we
started
down
stony
brook
towards
the
rackett
river
intending
to
pitch
our
tents
at
night
on
the
banks
of
lake
miles
distant
before
leaving
the
spectacle
ponds
we
visited
a
little
island
at
the
north
end
of
the
middle
pond
containing
perhaps
half
an
acre
this
island
has
a
few
norway
pines
upon
it
is
of
a
loose
sandy
soil
and
at
the
highest
portion
is
some
twenty
feet
above
the
level
of
the
water
it
is
a
great
resort
for
turtle
in
the
season
of
depositing
their
eggs
we
found
thousands
of
their
eggs
some
on
the
surface
and
some
buried
in
the
sand
and
if
one
in
a
dozen
of
them
brings
forth
a
turtle
there
will
be
no
lack
of
the
animal
in
the
neighborhood
stony
brook
is
a
sluggish
tortuous
stream
large
enough
to
float
our
little
boats
and
goes
meandering
most
of
the
way
for
five
miles
among
natural
meadows
overflowed
at
high
water
or
thinly
timbered
prairie
when
it
enters
the
rackett
i
discovered
on
a
former
visit
to
this
wilderness
when
the
water
was
very
low
a
spring
that
came
boiling
up
near
the
centre
of
the
stream
with
a
volume
large
enough
almost
to
carry
a
mill
it
was
at
a
point
where
a
high
sandy
bluff
along
which
the
stream
swept
terminated
as
we
approached
this
spot
i
suggested
to
spalding
who
was
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
to
prepare
his
rod
and
fly
we
approached
carefully
along
the
willows
on
the
opposite
shore
until
in
a
position
from
which
he
could
throw
in
the
direction
i
indicated
in
the
then
stage
of
the
water
there
was
no
appearance
of
a
spring
or
any
indication
marking
it
as
a
spot
where
the
trout
would
be
at
all
likely
to
congregate
and
spalding
was
half
inclined
to
believe
that
i
was
practising
upon
his
want
of
knowledge
of
the
habits
of
the
fish
of
this
region
i
had
said
nothing
about
the
spring
or
the
habit
of
the
trout
in
gathering
wherever
a
cold
stream
enters
a
river
or
a
spring
comes
gushing
up
in
its
bed
i
do
believe
there
a
trout
within
half
a
mile
of
us
he
said
as
he
adjusted
his
rod
and
fly
never
mind
i
replied
throw
your
fly
across
towards
that
boulder
on
the
bank
and
trail
it
home
and
you
see
well
said
he
here
goes
and
he
threw
in
the
direction
indicated
the
fly
had
scarcely
touched
the
water
when
a
trout
weighing
a
pound
or
over
struck
it
with
a
rush
that
carried
him
clear
out
of
the
water
after
a
little
play
he
was
landed
safely
in
the
boat
and
another
and
another
followed
at
almost
every
throw
not
once
did
the
fly
touch
the
water
that
it
was
not
risen
to
by
a
fish
by
jove
said
spalding
as
he
handed
me
the
to
take
in
his
third
or
fourth
trout
this
is
sport
you
use
the
net
and
trail
them
to
you
let
us
make
hay
while
the
sun
shines
the
other
boat
will
soon
be
along
and
smith
will
be
for
dipping
his
spoon
into
my
dish
i
want
to
astonish
him
when
he
comes
we
had
secured
eight
beautiful
fish
when
the
doctor
and
smith
rounded
the
point
above
us
we
motioned
them
back
and
their
boat
lay
upon
its
oars
spalding
kept
on
throwing
his
fly
and
trailing
the
trout
to
me
to
secure
with
the
hallo
shouted
smith
hold
on
there
fair
play
my
friends
give
me
a
hand
in
and
he
fell
to
adjusting
his
rod
and
flies
keep
back
you
lubber
replied
spalding
what
do
know
about
you
frighten
them
all
away
by
your
awkwardness
no
you
do
shouted
smith
his
rod
now
adjusted
drop
down
boatman
and
we
see
who
is
the
lubber
wait
spalding
do
throw
if
you
are
a
true
man
until
we
can
take
a
fair
start
and
then
the
one
that
comes
out
second
best
pays
the
piper
the
boat
dropped
down
to
the
proper
position
and
the
doctor
who
was
seated
in
the
stern
held
it
in
place
by
pressing
his
paddle
into
the
sand
at
the
bottom
while
the
boatman
handled
the
landing
net
now
exclaimed
smith
as
the
flies
dropped
upon
the
water
together
above
the
cold
spring
there
was
no
lack
of
trout
for
one
rose
to
the
fly
at
every
cast
i
say
said
the
doctor
how
many
have
you
in
your
boat
sixteen
i
replied
after
counting
them
we
got
eight
and
i
bar
any
more
fishing
the
law
has
reached
its
limit
no
wanton
waste
of
the
good
things
of
god
you
know
the
rods
were
unjointed
and
laid
away
and
such
a
string
of
trout
as
we
had
is
rarely
seen
outside
of
the
saranac
woods
we
procured
fresh
grass
in
which
to
lay
our
fish
and
green
boughs
to
cover
them
and
floated
on
down
the
stream
entering
the
rackett
at
nine
the
rackett
is
a
most
beautiful
river
to
me
at
least
it
is
so
for
it
flows
on
its
tortuous
and
winding
way
for
a
hundred
or
more
miles
through
an
unbroken
forest
with
all
the
old
things
standing
in
their
primeval
grandeur
along
its
banks
the
woodman
axe
has
not
marred
the
loveliness
of
its
surroundings
and
no
human
hand
has
for
all
that
distance
been
laid
upon
its
mane
or
harnessed
it
to
the
great
wheel
making
it
a
slave
compelling
it
to
be
utilitarian
to
grind
corn
or
throw
the
shuttle
and
spin
it
moves
on
towards
the
mighty
lawrence
as
wild
and
halterless
and
free
as
when
the
great
spirit
sent
it
forward
on
its
everlasting
flow
the
same
scenery
and
the
same
voices
are
seen
and
heard
along
its
banks
now
as
then
and
while
man
in
his
restlessness
has
changed
almost
everything
else
the
rackett
and
the
things
that
pertained
to
it
when
the
earth
was
young
remain
unchanged
but
this
will
not
be
so
long
civilization
is
pushing
its
way
even
towards
this
wild
and
for
all
agricultural
purposes
sterile
region
and
before
many
years
even
the
rackett
will
be
within
its
circle
when
that
time
shall
have
arrived
where
shall
we
go
to
find
the
woods
the
wild
things
the
old
forests
and
hear
the
sounds
which
belong
to
nature
in
its
primeval
state
whither
shall
we
flee
from
civilization
to
take
off
the
harness
and
be
free
for
a
season
from
the
restraints
the
conventionalities
of
society
and
rest
from
the
hard
struggles
the
cares
and
toils
the
strifes
and
competitions
of
life
had
i
my
way
i
would
mark
out
a
circle
of
a
hundred
miles
in
diameter
and
throw
around
it
the
protecting
aegis
of
the
constitution
i
would
make
it
a
forest
forever
it
should
be
a
misdemeanor
to
chop
down
a
tree
and
a
felony
to
clear
an
acre
within
its
boundaries
the
old
woods
should
stand
here
always
as
god
made
them
growing
on
until
the
earthworm
ate
away
their
roots
and
the
strong
winds
hurled
them
to
the
ground
and
new
woods
should
be
permitted
to
supply
the
place
of
the
old
so
long
as
the
earth
remained
there
is
room
enough
for
civilization
in
regions
better
fitted
for
it
it
has
no
business
among
these
mountains
these
rivers
and
lakes
these
gigantic
boulders
these
tangled
valleys
and
dark
mountain
gorges
let
it
go
where
labor
will
garner
a
richer
harvest
and
industry
reap
a
better
reward
for
its
toil
it
will
be
of
stinted
growth
at
best
here
i
like
these
old
woods
said
a
gentleman
whom
i
met
on
the
rackett
last
year
i
like
them
because
one
can
do
here
just
what
he
pleases
he
can
wear
a
shirt
a
week
have
holes
in
his
pantaloons
and
be
out
at
elbows
go
with
his
boots
unblacked
drink
whisky
in
the
raw
chew
plug
tobacco
and
smoke
a
black
pipe
and
not
lose
his
position
in
society
now
continued
he
tho
i
do
choose
to
do
any
of
these
things
yet
i
love
the
freedom
now
and
then
of
doing
just
all
of
them
if
i
choose
without
human
accountability
the
truth
is
that
it
is
natural
as
well
as
necessary
for
every
man
to
be
a
vagabond
occasionally
to
throw
off
the
restraints
imposed
upon
him
by
the
necessities
and
conventionalities
of
civilization
and
turn
savage
for
a
season
and
what
place
is
left
for
such
transformation
save
these
northern
forests
the
idea
was
somewhat
quaint
but
to
me
it
smacked
of
philosophy
and
i
yielded
it
a
hearty
assent
i
would
consecrate
these
old
forests
these
rivers
and
lakes
these
mountains
and
valleys
to
the
vagabond
spirit
and
make
them
a
place
wherein
a
man
could
turn
savage
and
rest
for
a
fortnight
or
a
month
from
the
toils
and
cares
of
life
we
entered
tupper
lake
towards
six
and
saw
our
white
tents
pitched
upon
the
left
bank
some
half
a
mile
above
the
outlet
where
a
little
stream
cold
almost
as
icewater
comes
down
from
a
spring
a
short
way
back
in
the
forest
this
lake
some
ten
miles
long
and
from
one
to
three
in
width
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
sheets
of
water
that
the
eye
of
man
ever
looked
upon
the
scenery
about
it
is
less
bold
than
that
of
some
of
the
other
lakes
of
this
region
the
hills
rise
with
a
gentle
acclivity
from
the
shore
behind
them
and
far
off
rise
rugged
mountain
ranges
and
further
still
the
lofty
peaks
of
the
adirondacks
loom
up
in
dim
and
shadowy
outline
against
the
sky
from
every
point
and
in
every
direction
are
views
of
placid
and
quiet
beauty
rarely
equalled
valleys
stretching
away
among
the
highlands
gaps
in
the
hills
through
which
the
sunlight
pours
long
after
the
shadows
of
the
forest
have
elsewhere
thrown
themselves
across
the
lake
islands
some
bold
and
rocky
rising
in
barren
desolation
right
up
from
the
deep
water
some
covered
with
a
dense
and
thrifty
growth
of
evergreen
trees
with
a
soil
matchless
in
fertility
and
some
partaking
of
both
the
sterile
and
productive
beautiful
bays
stealing
around
bold
promontories
and
hiding
away
among
the
old
woods
these
are
the
features
of
this
beautiful
sheet
of
water
which
none
see
but
to
admire
none
visit
but
to
praise
and
it
lies
here
all
alone
surrounded
by
the
old
hills
and
forests
bold
bluffs
and
rocky
shores
all
as
god
made
them
with
no
mark
of
the
hand
of
man
about
it
save
in
a
single
spot
on
a
secluded
bay
where
lives
a
solitary
family
in
a
log
house
surrounded
by
an
acre
or
two
from
which
the
forest
has
been
cleared
away
will
somebody
tell
me
said
smith
as
we
sat
on
the
logs
in
front
of
our
tent
after
supper
smudging
away
the
musquitoes
with
our
pipes
will
somebody
tell
me
what
we
came
into
this
wilderness
among
these
musquitoes
and
frogs
and
owls
for
mind
you
i
am
not
discontented
i
enjoy
it
hugely
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
i
do
so
i
desire
to
understand
the
philosophy
of
the
thing
as
the
question
involves
in
some
sense
a
physiological
fact
replied
the
doctor
it
comes
within
the
range
of
my
professional
duties
to
understand
and
be
able
to
answer
it
for
you
must
know
that
the
enjoyments
of
this
region
are
primarily
physical
now
i
a
theory
which
is
this
that
every
man
has
a
certain
amount
of
vagabondism
in
his
composition
that
will
be
pretty
certain
to
break
out
in
spots
occasionally
at
all
events
it
is
so
with
me
and
from
my
observation
of
men
i
am
strong
in
the
faith
that
it
is
so
with
every
one
who
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
human
it
is
all
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
i
come
off
here
enduring
a
heap
of
hardship
and
toil
simply
for
the
love
of
fishing
and
hunting
though
i
confess
to
a
weakness
to
a
certain
extent
that
way
the
charm
of
this
region
consists
in
the
fact
that
it
is
the
best
place
to
play
the
vagabond
and
in
which
to
do
the
savage
for
a
season
that
i
know
of
you
can
go
bareheaded
or
barefooted
without
a
coat
or
neckerchief
get
as
ragged
and
untidy
as
you
please
without
subjecting
yourself
to
remark
or
offending
the
nice
sense
of
propriety
pertaining
to
conventional
life
you
are
not
responsible
for
what
you
say
or
do
provided
always
that
you
do
not
offend
against
the
abstract
rules
of
decency
or
the
requirements
of
natural
decorum
you
can
lay
around
loose
the
lazier
you
are
the
better
the
boatman
in
your
employ
likes
it
if
you
choose
to
drift
leisurely
and
quietly
under
the
shadow
of
the
hills
along
the
shore
examining
the
rocks
that
lie
there
like
a
ruined
wall
or
explore
the
beautiful
and
secluded
bays
that
hide
around
behind
the
bluffs
or
lay
off
under
the
shade
of
the
fir
trees
on
the
islands
or
smoke
your
cigar
or
pipe
by
the
beautiful
spring
that
comes
bubbling
up
by
the
side
of
some
boulder
or
from
beneath
the
tangled
roots
of
some
gnarled
birch
or
maple
you
can
do
any
or
all
of
these
and
have
a
man
to
help
you
for
twelve
shillings
a
day
and
board
or
you
can
do
it
just
about
as
well
alone
you
remember
lonesome
rock
in
the
lower
saranac
a
great
boulder
that
lifts
its
head
some
ten
or
fifteen
feet
above
the
surface
away
out
near
the
middle
of
the
lake
around
which
the
water
is
of
unknown
depth
this
rock
which
is
always
dark
and
bare
is
as
you
will
remember
of
conical
shape
sharp
pointed
at
the
top
and
stands
up
about
the
size
of
a
small
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
do
you
remember
the
account
that
somebody
gives
in
a
ragged
but
terse
kind
of
verse
of
the
in
black
who
as
he
walked
about
and
forward
he
switched
his
long
rail
as
a
gentleman
switches
his
cane
and
of
whose
dress
it
was
facetiously
said
coat
was
red
and
his
breeches
were
blue
with
a
hole
behind
for
his
tail
to
stick
through
another
author
said
of
him
on
one
of
his
fishing
excursions
that
rod
it
was
a
sturdy
mountain
oak
his
line
a
cable
which
no
storm
broke
his
hook
he
baited
with
a
dragon
tail
and
sat
upon
a
rock
and
bob
for
whale
well
like
the
ebony
gentleman
you
can
if
you
choose
sit
upon
lonesome
rock
enjoying
your
meditations
and
bobbing
not
for
whale
for
whatever
other
fish
may
be
found
in
the
lower
saranac
i
believe
there
are
no
whale
but
you
can
bob
for
trout
whether
you
will
catch
any
or
not
will
depend
very
much
on
circumstances
it
is
a
capital
place
to
cast
the
fly
from
or
to
sink
your
hook
with
a
bait
and
if
the
trout
do
not
choose
to
bite
whose
fault
is
that
i
should
like
to
know
and
this
reminds
me
of
an
anecdote
told
me
by
a
gentleman
i
met
in
june
of
last
year
on
the
rackett
river
among
the
black
flies
of
an
adventure
he
met
with
on
lonesome
rock
last
season
he
had
been
trolling
around
the
lake
in
a
boat
alone
without
much
success
and
concluded
he
would
try
deep
fishing
from
this
rock
as
he
had
heard
that
the
trout
were
in
the
habit
of
congregating
around
its
base
so
he
rowed
to
the
rock
and
as
he
supposed
secured
his
boat
and
climbing
up
its
side
seated
himself
on
his
boat
cushion
on
the
top
he
caught
one
fine
fish
at
the
first
throw
and
took
it
for
granted
that
he
was
going
to
have
a
good
time
of
it
among
the
trout
when
he
mounted
the
rock
about
eleven
the
sky
was
overcast
and
he
caught
three
or
four
trout
of
good
size
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
but
the
sun
coming
out
bright
and
clear
the
fish
altered
their
minds
and
refused
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
his
hook
he
finally
concluded
to
give
up
the
business
and
seek
the
cooling
shadows
of
the
forest
trees
along
the
shore
but
his
boat
was
gone
and
upon
looking
around
he
saw
it
drifting
before
a
light
breeze
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
now
when
you
remember
that
all
around
the
lake
was
a
wilderness
save
a
single
spot
at
the
head
of
the
bay
where
house
stands
three
or
four
miles
distant
and
when
you
remember
also
that
no
boat
might
be
passing
during
the
next
hours
you
will
comprehend
that
his
position
was
none
of
the
pleasantest
there
he
sat
upon
the
top
of
his
rock
with
scarcely
room
to
turn
around
with
a
wide
sweep
of
deep
water
between
him
and
the
nearest
land
the
fish
utterly
refusing
to
bite
and
the
sun
blazing
down
upon
him
with
heat
like
a
furnace
as
it
crept
with
its
snail
pace
across
the
sky
at
first
he
was
inclined
to
smile
at
his
ridiculous
situation
all
alone
there
on
the
rock
but
as
the
wind
died
away
and
the
sun
poured
his
burning
rays
right
down
upon
him
and
he
panted
and
sweat
under
its
sweltering
influences
he
began
to
feel
a
little
more
serious
hours
glided
away
and
the
sun
crept
slowly
along
down
the
heavens
but
still
no
boat
made
its
appearance
the
sun
hid
itself
behind
the
hills
on
the
west
and
still
he
was
alone
the
shadows
crept
up
the
mountain
peaks
that
stand
up
like
grim
giants
away
off
in
the
east
and
twilight
began
to
throw
its
grey
mantle
over
the
lake
still
he
was
alone
the
darkness
began
to
gather
around
him
the
forests
along
the
shore
to
lose
their
distinctness
and
to
stand
in
sombre
and
shadowy
outline
above
the
water
still
no
prospect
of
relief
presented
itself
the
twilight
faded
from
the
west
the
stars
stole
out
in
the
heavens
the
milky
way
stretched
its
belt
of
light
across
the
sky
and
there
he
sat
alone
still
on
his
rock
the
night
dews
falling
around
him
and
the
night
voices
of
the
forest
coming
solemnly
out
over
the
water
things
had
now
assumed
a
serious
aspect
he
could
not
stretch
his
limbs
save
by
standing
erect
and
it
seemed
inevitable
that
he
must
watch
the
stars
during
the
night
as
he
had
watched
the
sun
during
the
day
to
sleep
there
was
out
of
the
question
there
was
no
room
for
a
sleeping
posture
and
the
danger
of
rolling
down
the
rock
into
the
water
kept
him
wide
awake
at
length
the
pleasant
sound
of
oars
and
voices
in
jolly
converse
fell
upon
his
ear
and
he
shouted
two
sportsmen
were
returning
from
the
upper
lakes
and
right
welcome
was
the
answer
they
returned
to
his
call
he
was
glad
enough
to
be
released
from
his
rock
upon
which
as
he
said
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
should
be
compelled
to
roost
like
a
turkey
on
the
ridge
of
a
barn
for
the
night
to
go
back
from
this
digression
continued
the
doctor
i
repeat
that
every
man
has
a
vein
of
the
vagabond
a
streak
of
the
savage
in
him
which
can
never
be
clean
wiped
out
educate
him
polish
him
as
you
may
it
will
be
in
him
still
and
he
will
love
to
go
off
into
the
old
woods
at
times
to
lay
around
loose
for
a
season
vagabondising
among
the
wild
and
savage
things
of
the
wilderness
it
is
but
indulging
the
original
instincts
of
our
nature
true
he
will
not
relish
his
savage
ways
a
great
while
his
old
habits
will
lead
him
back
to
civilization
to
the
luxury
of
a
room
the
quiet
of
an
easy
chair
and
the
repose
of
a
soft
bed
in
a
word
to
up
and
shave
and
dress
so
that
when
he
looks
into
a
glass
he
will
see
the
shadow
of
a
gentleman

a
new
sound
in
the
forest
old
sangamo
donkey
spalding
and
martin
went
out
upon
the
lake
after
dark
with
one
of
the
boats
to
hunt
by
torch
light
this
is
done
by
placing
a
lighted
torch
or
a
lamp
upon
a
standard
placed
upright
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
so
high
that
a
man
seated
or
lying
upon
the
bottom
of
the
craft
will
have
his
head
below
it
he
must
himself
be
in
someway
shaded
from
the
light
which
must
be
cast
forward
so
that
both
the
hunter
and
the
boatman
will
be
in
the
shadow
a
very
common
method
is
to
make
a
box
a
foot
or
less
square
open
or
with
a
pane
of
glass
on
one
side
a
stick
three
or
four
feet
long
is
run
through
an
auger
hole
in
the
top
and
bottom
and
wedged
fast
which
forms
a
standard
the
other
end
of
the
stick
is
run
through
a
hole
on
the
little
deck
on
the
forward
part
of
the
boat
and
placed
in
a
socket
formed
for
the
purpose
in
the
bottom
and
is
wedged
at
the
deck
so
as
to
make
it
steady
the
open
or

of
the
box
is
turned
forward
and
a
common
japan
lamp
placed
in
a
socket
prepared
for
it
in
the
box
this
of
course
throws
the
light
forward
while
the
occupants
of
the
boat
are
in
the
shadow
the
hunter
sits
or
more
commonly
lies
at
length
on
a
bed
of
boughs
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
with
his
rifle
so
far
in
front
that
the
light
will
fall
upon
the
forward
sight
an
experienced
boatman
will
paddle
silently
up
to
within
twenty
feet
of
a
deer
that
may
be
feeding
along
the
shore
the
stupid
animal
will
stand
gazing
in
astonishment
at
the
light
until
the

almost
touches

said
cullen
one
of
the
boatmen
as
the
hunters
disappeared
into
the
darkness
is
a
queer
boy
in
his
way
you
will
notice
that
when
he
straightens
up
and
takes
the
kinks
out
of
him
he
stands
six
feet
and
over
in
his
stockings
and
his
arms
hang
down
to
his
knees
he
the
strongest
man
in
these
woods
and
tolerably
active
when
there
occasion
for
it
he
is
a
droll
easy
tempered
chap
and
do
get
angry
at
trifles
he
is
fond
of
a
joke
himself
and
will
stand
having
a
good
many
sticks
poked
at
him
without
getting
riled
but
when
he
does
get
his
back
up
it
well
enough
to
stand
out
of
his
way
and
not
step
on
his
shadow
he
never
struck
a
man
but
once
in
real
earnest
and
that
was
over
in
keeseville
and
on
that
occasion
the
people
said
the
town
clock
had
struck
the
fellow
he
struck
went
eend
over
eend
and
then
went
down
and
when
he
went
down
he
laid
still
he
did
come
to
tine
but
what
i
was
going
to
tell
you
is
that
hank
and
i
were
down
at
plattsburgh
last
fall
and
a
big
fellow
who
had
taken
quite
as
much
red
eye
as
was
for
his
good
undertook
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
hank
and
give
him
a
beating
hank
as
i
said
being
a
peaceable
man
and
much
more
given
to
fun
than
to
fighting
kept
and
avoided
a
scrimmage
as
long
as
he
could
but
his
patience
and
his
temper
at
last
caved
in
and
seizing
his
opponent
by
the
neck
with
his
left
hand
and
thrusting
him
down
upon
the
ground
he
began
very
deliberately
to
cuff
him
with
his
right
in
a
way
that
seemed
anything
but
pleasant
to
the
individual
upon
whom
his
cuffs
were
bestowed
enough
cried
his
assailant
up
enough
enough
your
tongue
you
scoundrel
replied
hank
as
he
kept
on
pommeling
his
enemy
your
tongue
i
tell
you
you
ai
a
judge
of
these
things
i
let
you
know
when
you
got
enough
when
he
given
him
what
he
thought
was
about
right
he
lifted
him
on
to
his
feet
and
holding
him
up
face
to
face
with
himself
a
moment
said
he
at
me
well
so
that
you
know
me
when
i
come
this
way
again
and
when
you
see
my
trail
you
better
travel
some
other
road
speaking
of
plattsburgh
said
the
doctor
reminds
me
of
an
incident
which
occurred
to
a
friend
and
myself
over
in
the
chataugay
woods
between
the
chazy
and
the
upper
chataugay
lakes
i
was
spending
a
few
days
at
plattsburgh
and
hearing
a
good
deal
of
the
trout
and
deer
in
and
about
those
lakes
my
friend
and
myself
concluded
to
pay
them
a
flying
visit
on
the
banks
of
the
chazy
and
near
the
outlet
a
that
is
half
french
and
half
indian
had
built
him
a
log
cabin
and
cleared
about
an
acre
of
land
around
it
his
live
stock
consisted
of
two
homely
lean
and
dogs
and
as
ragged
and
a
donkey
as
could
be
found
in
a
week
travel
the
was
a
sort
of
half
fisherman
and
half
hunter
excelling
in
nothing
unless
it
be
that
he
was
the
laziest
man
this
side
of
the
rocky
mountains
he
succeeded
occasionally
in
killing
a
deer
in
the
forest
and
when
he
did
so
he
would
lead
his
donkey
to
the
place
of
slaughter
and
bring
in
the
carcase
on
the
animal
back
we
were
passing
from
the
chazy
to
bradley
lake
and
had
sat
down
on
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
to
take
a
short
breathing
spell
it
was
a
warm
afternoon
and
the
air
was
calm
not
a
breath
stirred
the
leaves
on
the
old
trees
around
us
the
forest
sounds
were
hushed
save
the
tap
of
the
woodpecker
on
his
hollow
tree
or
an
occasional
drumming
of
a
partridge
on
his
log
it
was
drawing
towards
one
of
those
calm
still
autumnal
evenings
of
which
poets
sing
but
which
are
to
be
met
with
in
all
their
glory
only
among
the
beautiful
lakes
that
lay
sleeping
in
the
wild
woods
and
surrounded
by
old
primeval
things
the
path
wound
round
a
densely
wooded
and
sombre
hollow
the
depths
of
which
the
eye
could
not
penetrate
but
from
out
of
which
came
the
song
of
a
stream
that
went
cascading
down
the
rocks
and
rippling
among
the
loose
boulders
that
lay
in
its
course
beyond
us
through
an
opening
in
the
trees
we
could
see
the
lake
sparkling
and
shining
in
the
evening
sunbeams
and
we
were
talking
about
the
beauty
of
the
view
and
the
calmness
and
repose
that
seemed
resting
upon
all
things
when
of
a
sudden
there
came
up
from
that
shadowy
dell
a
sound
the
most
unearthly
that
ever
broke
upon
the
astonished
ear
of
mortal
man
i
have
heard
the
roar
of
the
lion
of
the
desert
the
yell
of
the
hyena
the
trumpeting
of
the
elephant
the
scream
of
the
panther
the
howl
of
the
wolf
it
was
like
none
of
these
but
if
you
could
imagine
them
all
combined
and
concentrated
into
a
single
sound
and
ushered
together
upon
the
air
from
a
single
throat
shaped
like
the
long
neck
of
some
gigantic
ichthiosaurus
of
the
times
of
old
you
would
have
some
faint
idea
of
the
strange
sounds
that
came
roaring
up
from
that
hollow
way
my
friend
was
a
man
of
courage
and
like
myself
had
been
around
the
world
some
had
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
first
and
last
in
the
woods
was
familiar
with
most
of
the
legitimate
forest
sounds
and
had
heard
all
the
ten
thousand
voices
that
belong
in
the
wilderness
but
we
had
never
before
listened
to
a
noise
like
that
we
looked
to
our
rifles
and
at
one
another
and
it
may
well
be
that
our
hats
sat
somewhat
loosely
upon
our
heads
from
an
involuntary
rising
of
the
hair
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
mysterious
cried
my
friend
in
amazement
that
is
more
than
i
know
i
replied
as
i
placed
a
fresh
cap
on
my
rifle
after
a
few
minutes
the
sounds
were
repeated
and
the
hills
seemed
to
groan
with
affright
as
they
sent
them
back
in
wavy
and
quavering
echoes
from
their
rugged
sides
must
understand
this
said
my
friend
as
he
led
the
way
with
a
cautious
and
stealthy
movement
towards
the
depths
of
the
hollow
whence
the
sounds
came
and
there
by
the
stream
on
a
little
stood
old
sangamo
donkey
by
the
side
of
a
deer
old
sangamo
himself
was
stretched
at
full
length
on
the
bank
fast
asleep
how
he
could
have
slept
on
with
such
an
infernal
roaring
as
that
donkey
made
in
those
old
woods
six
or
eight
miles
outside
of
a
fence
is
more
than
i
can
comprehend
but
he
did
sleep
through
it
all
and
was
wakened
only
by
a
punch
in
the
ribs
with
the
butt
of
my
rifle
instigated
by
pity
for
the
poor
donkey
that
was
being
eaten
up
by
the
flies
we
helped
him
to
load
the
carcass
of
the
deer
on
the
back
of
his
donkey
and
saw
him
move
off
lazily
towards
home
i
have
heard
a
good
many
strange
noises
in
my
day
but
never
on
any
other
occasion
have
i
listened
to
anything
to
be
at
all
compared
with
the
noise
made
by
the
braying
of
old
sangamo
donkey
in
the
chataugay
woods
as
the
doctor
concluded
his
story
the
sharp
crack
of
spalding
rifle
broke
the
stillness
of
the
night
and
went
reverberating
among
the
hills
and
dying
away
over
the
lake
it
was
but
a
short
distance
from
our
camp
in
a
little
bay
hidden
away
around
a
wooded
promontory
below
us
in
a
few
minutes
the
light
was
seen
rounding
the
point
that
hid
the
bay
from
our
view
and
as
the
boat
landed
in
front
of
our
tents
spalding
and
martin
lifted
from
it
a
fine
two
year
old
deer
shot
directly
between
the
eyes
illustration
how
he
could
have
slept
on
with
such
an
infernal
roaring
as
that
donkey
made
in
those
old
woods
six
or
eight
miles
outside
of
a
fence
is
more
than
i
can
there
said
spalding
is
the
biggest
or
what
the
biggest
fool
of
a
deer
in
these
woods
do
you
believe
that
he
stood
perfectly
still
gazing
in
stupid
astonishment
at
our
light
until
we
were
within
a
dozen
feet
of
him
when
i
dropped
him
with
that
ball
between
the
eyes
no
replied
smith
i
really
do
believe
any
such
thing
it
is
true
notwithstanding
your
lack
of
faith
said
spalding
do
you
say
that
as
counsel
or
as
a
gentleman
inquired
smith
look
you
smith
said
spalding
you
are
drawing
a
distinction
not
warranted
by
the
authority
of
the
books
as
if
a
lawyer
could
not
tell
the
truth
like
a
gentleman
i
say
it
as
both
very
well
remarked
smith
then
i
must
believe
it
of
course
but
understand
hank
martin
it
will
be
my
turn
night
and
so
the
matter
was
settled
that
the
next
night
hunting
was
to
be
done
by
smith
h
said
the
doctor
as
i
was
stealing
quietly
out
of
the
tent
in
the
twilight
of
the
next
morning
so
as
not
to
awaken
my
companions
where
now
i
going
to
take
some
trout
for
breakfast
with
our
venison
i
replied
and
where
do
you
propose
to
take
them
he
inquired
come
with
me
and
i
show
you
i
looked
the
place
out
last
evening
and
if
done
sleeping
we
have
some
sport
agreed
said
he
and
we
paddled
around
the
point
into
a
little
bay
at
the
head
of
which
a
small
but
cold
stream
entered
the
lake
the
doctor
sat
in
the
bow
and
having
adjusted
his
rod
i
steered
the
boat
carefully
close
along
the
shore
to
within
reach
of
the
mouth
of
the
brook
and
directed
him
to
cast
across
it
the
moment
his
fly
touched
the
water
half
a
dozen
fish
rose
to
it
together
it
was
eagerly
seized
by
one
weighing
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
pound
which
was
lifted
bodily
into
the
boat
he
caught
as
fast
as
he
could
cast
his
fly
they
were
the
genuine
brook
trout
none
of
them
exceeding
a
quarter
of
a
pound
in
weight
in
half
an
hour
we
had
secured
as
many
as
we
needed
for
breakfast
and
paddled
back
to
take
a
morning
nap
while
the
meal
was
being
prepared
the
sweetest
fish
that
swims
is
the
brook
trout
weighing
from
a
quarter
of
a
pound
down
rolled
in
flour
or
meal
and
fried
brown
they
have
no
equal
the
lake
and
river
trout
weighing
from
two
to
ten
pounds
beautiful
as
they
are
have
not
that
delicacy
of
flavor
which
belongs
to
the
genuine
brook
trout
boiled
when
freshly
caught
they
are
by
no
means
to
be
spoken
lightly
of
they
have
few
equals
cooked
in
that
way
but
as
a
pan
fish
they
are
not
to
be
compared
with
the

covered
with

we
crossed
over
towards
a
deep
bay
on
the
west
shore
to
where
a
stream
comes
cascading
down
the
rocks
and
leaping
into
the
lake
as
if
rejoicing
at
finding
a
in
its
quiet
bosom
the
spot
where
this
stream
enters
is
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
old
forest
trees
that
reach
their
leafy
arms
far
out
from
the
ledges
on
which
they
grow
forming
an
arch
above
and
shutting
out
the
sunlight
here
the
trout
congregate
to
enjoy
the
cool
water
that
comes
down
from
the
hills
above
we
approached
it
carefully
and
smith
by
way
of
experiment
cast
his
fly
across
the
current
where
the
stream
enters
the
lake
it
was
seized
by
a
beautiful
fish
weighing
perhaps
two
pounds
we
did
not
need
him
for
the
place
where
we
proposed
to
pitch
our
tents
for
the
night
would
afford
us
all
the
fish
required
and
after
lifting
him
into
the
boat
with
the
and
releasing
the
hook
from
his
jaw
we
returned
him
to
the
lake
again
two
miles
from
the
head
of
the
lake
on
the
east
side
is
a
deep
bay
at
the
head
of
which
enters
a
little
brook
that
comes
creeping
along
for
a
mile
among
the
tangled
roots
of
ancient
hemlocks
and
spruce
singing
gaily
among
the
loose
stones
sometimes
disappearing
entirely
beneath
bridges
of
moss
and
sometimes
sparkling
in
the
sunlight
on
its
way
to
the
lake
this
little
stream
we
found
swarming
with
speckled
trout
of
the
size
of
minnows
and
at
its
mouth
the
large
trout
congregated
as
we
rounded
one
of
the
points
that
shut
out
the
view
of
this
bay
from
the
lake
we
saw
two
deer
feeding
quietly
upon
the
lily
pads
along
the
shore
some
quarter
of
a
mile
from
us
we
dropped
quietly
back
behind
the
point
where
smith
and
one
of
the
boatmen
prepared
to
take
a
shot
at
them
martin
took
his
seat
in
the
stern
with
his
paddle
and
smith
lay
stretched
at
length
along
the
bottom
of
the
boat
upon
boughs
prepared
for
the
occasion
with
his
rifle
resting
upon
the
forward
end
of
the
boat
it
was
broad
daylight
and
to
paddle
up
within
shooting
distance
of
a
deer
under
such
circumstances
in
plain
view
of
an
animal
the
most
wary
is
a
delicate
job
but
it
may
be
done
i
have
more
than
once
been
thus
paddled
within
thirty
yards
of
a
deer
while
feeding
in
the
water
the
wind
must
be
blowing
from
the
deer
to
the
hunter
or
the
scent
will
alarm
the
animal
and
he
will
go
snorting
and
bounding
away
smith
and
martin
passed
silently
out
into
the
bay
and
moved
slowly
towards
where
the
deer
were
feeding
the
boat
in
which
we
sat
was
permitted
to
float
out
to
a
position
from
which
we
could
see
the
sportsmen
as
they
approached
the
game
slowly
but
steadily
they
moved
the
paddle
remaining
in
the
water
sculling
the
little
craft
along
as
if
it
were
a
log
drifting
in
the
water
the
deer
occasionally
raised
their
heads
looking
all
around
evidently
regarding
the
boat
as
a
harmless
thing
floating
in
from
the
lake
after
gazing
thus
about
them
they
stooped
their
heads
again
and
went
on
feeding
as
if
no
danger
were
near
them
the
hunters
drifted
within
seventy
or
eighty
yards
of
the
game
when
a
column
of
white
smoke
shot
suddenly
up
from
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
the
report
of
smith
rifle
rang
out
sharp
and
clear
over
the
lake
we
saw
where
the
ball
struck
the
water
just
beyond
the
deer
passing
directly
under
its
belly
possibly
high
enough
to
graze
its
body
at
the
flash
and
report
of
the
rifle
the
animal
leaped
high
into
the
air
bounded
in
affright
this
way
and
that
for
a
moment
and
then
straightened
itself
for
the
woods
we
heard
his
snort
as
he
went
crashing
up
the
hillside
reader
should
you
ever
drift
out
to
this
beautiful
lake
you
will
find
on
the
ridge
just
above
where
bog
river
comes
tumbling
and
roaring
and
foaming
over
the
rocks
into
the
lake
the
charred
remains
of
a
campfire
built
against
a
great
log
that
was
once
the
trunk
of
a
tall
forest
tree
if
you
should
visit
it
within
a
year
or
two
you
will
perhaps
notice
some
forked
stakes
standing
a
few
feet
from
the
place
of
the
fire
and
a
bed
of
withered
and
dry
boughs
now
fresh
and
green
well
our
tents
were
stretched
over
those
stakes
those
boughs
were
our
bed
and
those
charred
chunks
are
the
remains
of
our
campfire
that
sent
a
sepulchral
light
among
the
forest
trees
around
the
sounds
that
come
upon
the
ear
during
the
night
in
a
far
off
place
like
this
are
peculiar
the
old
owl
hoots
mournfully
the
frogs
bellow
hoarsely
along
the
reedy
shore
while
the
tree
toads
are
quavering
from
among
the
branches
of
the
scrubby
trees
that
grow
along
the
rocky
banks
the
whippoorwill
pipes
shrilly
in
the
forest
depths
the
breeze
murmurs
among
the
foliage
of
the
tall
old
pines
while
the
everlasting
roar
of
the
waters
as
they
go
tumbling
down
the
rocks
is
always
heard
however
diversified
these
sounds
may
be
they
all
invite
to
repose
they
fall
soothingly
upon
the
ear
and
though
all
are
distinctly
heard
yet
strange
as
it
may
seem
there
is
a
strong
impression
upon
the
mind
of
the
deep
silence
pervading
the
forest
this
impression
is
doubtless
occasioned
by
the
utter
dissimilarity
between
the
voices
one
hears
in
the
day
from
those
which
fall
upon
the
ear
in
the
night
time
the
former
are
all
joyous
and
happy
full
of
gladness
and
merriment
full
of
life
and
animation
the
latter
solemn
deep
profound
lulling
to
the
senses
not
sorrowful
nor
sad
yet
still
such
as
form
a
calm
and
quiet
lullaby
under
the
influence
of
which
one
glides
away
into
slumber
and
sleeps
quietly
until
dawn
then
the
voice
of
gladness
breaks
so
tumultuously
on
the
ear
that
he
must
be
a
sluggard
indeed
who
can
resist
their
wakening
influences
how
beautifully
the
sun
went
down
behind
the
hills
lighting
up
the
western
sky
and
the
fleecy
clouds
floating
in
the
heavens
with
a
blaze
of
glory
throwing
a
mantle
of
silver
over
the
tall
ranges
and
mountain
peaks
that
loomed
up
in
solemn
grandeur
away
in
the
east
and
how
stilly
silently
the
stars
came
out
from
the
depths
above
and
how
brightly
and
truthfully
they
were
given
back
from
away
down
in
depths
beneath
the
placid
waters
we
had
taken
half
a
dozen
beautiful
trout
from
the
foot
of
the
falls
where
the
current
shoots
out
into
the
lake
we
had
eaten
them
too
and
were
sitting
in
front
of
our
tents
smoking
our
evening
pipes
spalding
said
the
doctor
how
i
wish
our
little
boys
were
out
here
with
us
how
they
would
enjoy
themselves
among
these
lakes
and
rivers
it
is
a
hard
lot
that
the
children
of
our
cities
have
in
life
they
struggle
up
to
man
and
womanhood
against
fearful
odds
and
the
wonder
is
that
they
do
not
perish
in
their
infancy
that
they
are
not
blasted
as
the
blossoms
are
when
the
cold
east
wind
sweeps
over
the
earth
you
are
right
my
friend
replied
spalding
i
should
like
to
have
our
little
boys
and
girls
too
for
that
matter
with
us
for
a
few
days
out
here
on
these
lakes
it
would
be
a
lifetime
to
them
measuring
time
by
the
enjoyment
it
would
afford
them
still
their
city
habits
might
make
them
tire
of
this
freedom
in
a
week
you
and
i
enjoy
it
longer
because
it
brings
back
old
memories
and
relieves
us
from
the
toils
of
business
and
the
restraints
of
conventional
life
you
are
right
too
in
saying
that
the
lot
of
our
city
children
is
a
hard
one
to
live
imprisoned
between
long
rows
of
brick
walls
breathing
an
atmosphere
charged
with
the
exhalations
of
ten
thousand
cooking
stoves
the
dust
of
forges
and
the
smoke
of
furnaces
machine
shops
gas
works
filthy
streets
and
the
thousand
other
manufactories
of
villainous
smells
where
the
summer
air
has
no
freshness
no
forest
odors
or
sweetness
gathered
from
fields
of
grain
the
meadows
or
the
pastures
to
tramp
only
on
stone
sidewalks
to
know
nothing
of
the
pleasant
paths
beneath
the
spreading
branches
of
old
primeval
trees
no
soft
grass
for
their
little
feet
to
press
never
to
wander
along
the
streams
or
the
little
brooks
to
be
strangers
always
to
the
beautiful
things
spread
out
everywhere
in
the
country
in
the
summer
time
i
always
feel
sad
when
i
see
the
pale
faces
of
the
little
children
of
the
great
cities
and
marvel
how
so
many
of
them
grow
up
to
be
men
and
women
it
is
a
hard
lot
to
be
cooped
up
in
the
city
vegitating
as
it
were
in
the
shade
where
there
is
no
grass
for
their
little
feet
to
press
no
fences
to
climb
or
fields
to
ramble
over
or
brooks
to
wade
or
running
water
on
which
to
float
chips
and
wherein
to
watch
the
little
chubs
and
shiners
dancing
and
playing
about
or
fresh
pure
air
to
breathe
or
birds
to
listen
to
it
is
a
thousand
pities
that
the
cities
could
not
be
emptied
every
summer
of
their
little
people
into
the
free
and
open
country
where
they
could
run
about
and
sport
and
play
and
have
free
range
and
plenty
of
it
would
make
them
so
much
healthier
and
happier
so
much
more
cheerful
their
voices
of
gladness
would
ring
out
so
much
more
joyously
in
the
morning
and
their
songs
be
so
much
more
sweet
at
night
i
remember
an
anecdote
told
me
of
a
little
child
born
in
the
great
metropolis
who
had
never
until
her
fifth
summer
been
outside
of
the
paved
streets
of
new
york
her
mother
had
friends
residing
in
one
of
the
towns
owning
a
beautiful
farm
overlooking
the
hudson
and
in
early
may
she
paid
them
a
visit
taking
her
little
daughter
with
her
mary
of
course
was
delighted
like
a
bird
freed
from
its
cage
she
flew
about
here
there
everywhere
and
out
among
the
chickens
and
the
pigs
the
turkeys
and
the
lambs
enjoying
to
the
full
the
thousand
new
things
that
her
eyes
rested
upon
all
around
her
and
her
young
spirits
in
wild
commotion
under
the
bracing
influences
of
the
country
air
mother
mother
she
exclaimed
as
she
came
dashing
into
the
parlor
her
beautiful
curls
floating
wildly
over
her
shoulders
and
her
bright
eyes
wide
open
with
wonder
mother
i
mother
come
out
here
quick
and
see
this
funny
tree
all
covered
over
with
and
how
sweet
it
smells
all
around
it
it
was
a
plum
tree
in
full
blossom
that
little
child
had
never
seen
the
beautiful
spring
blossoms
on
the
fruit
trees
i
have
no
children
of
my
own
remarked
smith
and
therefore
may
not
be
regarded
as
the
best
authority
in
regard
to
the
manner
of
treating
or
rearing
children
but
i
have
often
wondered
at
the
very
great
mistakes
people
sometimes
make
in
regard
to
them
there
are
parents
who
mean
no
wrong
and
yet
who
make
no
scruple
of
deceiving
them
in
reply
to
their
simple
questionings
forgetting
or
regardless
of
the
fact
that
a
false
answer
to
their
innocent
inquiries
put
in
good
faith
and
in
the
earnest
pursuit
of
truth
may
plant
an
error
in
their
minds
which
may
take
years
of
experience
and
often
a
painful
amount
of
ridicule
to
eradicate
i
knew
a
little
boy
years
ago
a
thoughtful
philosophic
child
who
speculated
in
his
simplicity
upon
what
he
saw
as
great
philosophers
do
in
their
wisdom
upon
the
various
phenomena
of
nature
his
father
had
a
great
barn
above
which
as
was
the
fashion
long
ago
perched
upon
a
staff
a
few
feet
above
the
ridgepole
was
a
fashioned
out
of
a
piece
of
board
in
the
shape
of
a
rooster
said
the
little
boy
one
day
makes
that
rooster
always
point
his
head
one
way
when
the
cold
wind
blows
and
the
other
way
when
it
is
warm
and
pleasant
always
looks
towards
the
place
where
the
wind
comes
from
replied
the
father
he
gets
too
warm
and
the
sun
is
too
hot
for
him
he
turns
his
tail
to
the
south
and
the
north
wind
is
sure
to
come
down
cold
and
chill
to
cool
him
off
he
call
the
cold
wind
father
and
will
it
come
when
he
looks
that
way
was
the
next
inquiry
replied
his
father
carelessly
that
was
a
wrong
and
a
foolish
answer
that
little
boy
relying
in
his
simple
faith
upon
the
wisdom
and
truthfulness
of
his
father
believed
for
a
long
time
that
the
weathercock
on
the
top
of
the
barn
could
bring
the
cold
north
or
the
warm
south
wind
by
turning
upon
its
perch
he
was
cured
of
his
error
only
by
being
laughed
at
for
his
simplicity
parents
should
never
deceive
their
children
by
a
careless
or
a
wrong
answer
to
the
simple
questions
put
to
them
by
these
little
searchers
after
knowledge
i
remember
said
the
doctor
and
it
is
one
of
the
earliest
incidents
which
my
recollection
has
treasured
that
i
was
out
one
evening
in
autumn
with
a
boy
older
than
myself
gathering
hazel
nuts
the
sun
had
sunk
behind
the
hills
and
the
shadows
of
twilight
were
gathering
in
the
valley
it
was
a
beautiful
and
calm
evening
the
solemn
stillness
of
which
was
only
broken
by
the
tza
of
thousands
of
katydids
among
the
bushes
i
asked
my
companion
what
it
was
that
made
the
noise
i
heard
and
he
supposing
that
i
referred
to
sounds
that
came
up
occasionally
from
the
lake
after
listening
for
a
moment
answered
that
it
was
made
by
the
wild
geese
in
my
simplicity
i
believed
it
and
it
was
not
until
i
caught
the
next
season
a
katydid
while
it
was
in
the
act
of
singing
that
i
discovered
that
the
music
among
the
hazel
bushes
was
not
made
by
the
wild
geese
i
never
respect
a
man
or
woman
said
spalding
whose
heart
does
not
warm
towards
little
children
who
takes
no
pleasure
nor
interest
in
their
society
who
has
no
patience
to
listen
to
their
simple
thoughts
expressed
in
their
simple
way
said
a
little
child
of
four
or
five
years
of
age
one
evening
when
the
summer
air
was
warm
and
the
skies
were
bright
above
as
she
sat
beside
her
mother
on
a
bench
beneath
the
spreading
branches
of
the
tall
old
elms
in
front
of
the
house
what
makes
the
stars
come
out
only
after
the
dark
has
come
down
and
why
do
the
moon
go
up
into
the
sky
like
the
sun
in
the
day
time
i
listened
anxiously
for
the
reply
i
knew
the
kind
heart
of
that
mother
how
truthful
it
was
and
how
earnest
and
pure
in
its
affection
for
its
gentle
and
only
darling
here
upon
my
lap
mary
said
the
mother
i
will
try
and
explain
it
all
so
that
you
will
understand
it
and
she
told
the
little
child
how
god
made
the
sun
to
rule
the
day
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
to
rule
the
night
how
that
the
stars
were
always
in
the
sky
but
how
the
superior
brightness
of
the
sun
put
them
out
in
the
day
time
how
the
stars
that
twinkled
like
little
in
the
heavens
were
great
worlds
a
thousand
times
larger
than
this
earth
made
and
placed
away
up
in
the
sky
by
the
same
great
and
good
god
who
made
the
world
we
live
in
little
mary
was
silent
and
attentive
to
the
simple
lecture
until
it
was
finished
and
then
asked
so
simply
and
confidingly
that
i
could
not
help
smiling
to
think
that
the
mind
of
childhood
should
be
running
upon
a
subject
and
seeking
a
solution
of
the
same
question
which
has
puzzled
the
profoundest
philosophers
through
all
time
said
the
little
one
there
people
in
the
moon
and
in
the
stars
them
great
worlds
that
look
to
us
so
like
candles
in
the
sky
question
my
child
said
the
mother
can
not
answer
believe
said
the
child
that
there
people
in
the
moon
and
in
all
the
stars
asked
her
mother
i
do
believe
god
would
make
such
big
and
beautiful
worlds
without
making
people
to
live
in
them
what
more
has
the
profoundest
philosopher
who
ever
lived
said
to
prove
that
those
mighty
worlds
which
are
seen
in
the
heavens
at
night
that
are
scattered
all
through
the
universe
of
god
rolling
forever
on
their
everlasting
rounds
are
peopled
by
living
moving
sentient
beings
chapter
xi
a
convention
broken
up
in
a
bow
the
chairman
ejected
we
sent
forward
our
boatman
with
the
luggage
early
in
the
morning
up
bog
river
towards
mud
lake
the
source
of
the
right
branch
of
that
river
lying
some
thirty
miles
deeper
in
the
wilderness
counting
the
sinuosities
of
the
stream
and
said
to
be
the
highest
body
of
water
in
all
this
wild
region
we
were
to
spend
the
day
on
tupper
lake
and
follow
him
the
next
morning
our
boatman
built
for
our
accommodation
a
brush
shanty
in
the
place
of
our
tents
we
rowed
about
this
beautiful
sheet
of
water
exploring
its
secluded
bays
and
romantic
islands
trying
experiments
with
the
trout
wherever
a
stream
came
down
from
the
hills
and
trolling
for
lake
trout
while
crossing
the
lake
near
the
shore
on
the
west
bank
perhaps
half
a
mile
from
the
falls
is
one
of
the
coldest
purest
and
most
beautiful
springs
that
i
ever
met
with
it
comes
up
into
a
little
basin
some
six
or
eight
feet
in
diameter
by
two
or
three
in
depth
the
bottom
is
of
loose
white
sand
which
is
all
in
commotion
by
the
constant
boiling
up
of
the
clear
cold
water
from
this
basin
a
little
stream
goes
rippling
and
laughing
to
the
lake
towards
evening
we
returned
to
our
shanty
with
abundance
of
fish
for
supper
and
breakfast
taken
as
i
said
in
simply
trying
experiments
as
to
where
they
were
to
be
found
in
the
greatest
abundance
if
any
sportsman
who
may
drift
out
this
way
is
fond
of
taking
the
speckled
trout
little
fellows
weighing
from
a
quarter
of
a
pound
down
the
same
he
meets
with
in
the
streams
of
vermont
in
massachusetts
in
northern
pennsylvania
and
western
new
york
let
him
provide
himself
with
and
row
to
the
head
of
the
lake
a
short
distance
east
of
where
bog
river
enters
say
from
a
quarter
to
half
a
mile
he
will
find
a
cold
mountain
stream
let
him
rig
for
and
take
to
that
stream
if
he
does
not
fill
his
basket
in
a
little
while
he
may
set
it
down
to
the
score
of
bad
luck
or
some
lack
of
skill
on
his
part
in
taking
them
for
the
brook
trout
are
there
in
abundance
across
the
lake
from
long
island
to
the
right
as
you
go
up
the
lake
is
a
bay
that
goes
away
in
around
a
woody
point
at
the
head
of
this
bay
grindstone
brook
enters
it
is
a
smallish
stream
and
comes
dashing
down
over
shelving
rocks
some
thirty
feet
and
shoots
out
into
the
bay
among
broken
rocks
and
loose
boulders
the
waters
of
this
stream
are
much
colder
than
those
of
the
lake
let
the
sportsman
row
carefully
up
towards
the
mouth
of
this
stream
along
towards
evening
of
a
hot
day
when
the
shadow
of
the
hill
reaches
far
out
over
the
lake
and
cast
his
fly
across
the
little
current
and
if
he
does
not
take
as
beautiful
a
string
of
river
trout
as
can
be
found
in
these
parts
let
him
set
it
down
to
the
score
of
accident
for
the
trout
are
there
in
the
warm
days
of
august
if
he
has
a
curiosity
to
know
what
there
is
above
these
little
falls
let
him
try
his
in
the
brook
just
over
the
ridge
and
he
will
find
out
i
claim
to
have
discovered
these
choice
fishing
places
some
seasons
since
and
have
kept
them
for
my
own
private
use
and
amusement
nobody
seemed
to
know
of
them
when
the
trout
refused
to
be
taken
elsewhere
i
have
always
found
them
here
abundant
greedy
and
ready
to
be
taken
by
any
decently
skillful
effort
i
regard
these
places
as
in
some
sort
my
private
property
and
i
mention
them
privately
and
in
confidence
to
the
reader
trusting
that
my
right
will
be
respected
we
finished
our
evening
meal
while
the
sun
was
yet
above
the
western
hills
and
sat
with
our
pipes
around
a
smudge
made
upon
the
broad
flat
rock
which
recedes
with
a
gentle
acclivity
from
the
shore
where
the
bog
river
enters
the
lake
looking
out
over
the
stirless
waters
it
was
a
beautiful
view
so
calm
so
still
and
placid
and
yet
so
wild
the
islands
seemed
to
stand
out
clear
from
the
water
to
be
lifted
up
as
it
were
from
the
lake
so
perfectly
moveless
and
polished
was
its
surface
on
a
grassy
point
to
the
right
and
a
hundred
rods
distant
two
deer
were
quietly
feeding
while
in
a
little
bay
on
the
left
a
brood
of
young
ducks
were
sporting
and
skimming
along
the
water
in
playful
gyrations
around
their
staid
and
watchful
mother
on
the
outstretched
arm
of
a
dead
tree
on
the
island
before
us
sat
a
bald
eagle
pluming
himself
and
high
above
the
lake
the
osprey
soared
turning
his
piercing
eye
downward
watching
for
his
prey
i
been
thinking
said
smith
as
he
refilled
his
pipe
of
what
the
doctor
was
saying
the
other
evening
about
every
body
having
a
streak
of
the
vagabond
in
him
which
makes
him
relish
an
occasional
tramp
in
the
old
woods
among
the
natural
things
things
that
have
not
been
marred
by
the
barbarisms
so
to
speak
of
civilization
inclined
to
believe
his
theory
to
be
true
but
i
see
a
difficulty
in
its
practical
working
now
suppose
doctor
that
you
and
i
being
out
here
together
vagabondizing
as
you
term
it
and
your
streak
of
the
vagabond
being
twice
as
large
as
mine
you
would
of
course
desire
to
play
the
savage
twice
as
long
as
i
should
there
would
in
that
case
be
a
marring
of
the
harmonies
i
should
be
anxious
to
get
back
to
civilization
while
you
being
rather
in
your
normal
element
would
insist
upon
around
loose
as
you
say
for
mercy
knows
how
long
gentlemen
said
the
doctor
in
reply
only
hear
this
fellow
getting
homesick
already
he
has
no
wife
not
a
child
in
the
world
no
business
nothing
to
call
him
home
save
a
superannuated
pointer
and
an
old
tom
cat
and
yet
he
would
leave
these
glorious
old
woods
these
beautiful
lakes
these
rivers
these
trout
and
deer
and
all
the
glad
music
of
the
wild
things
and
go
back
to
the
dust
the
poisoned
atmosphere
the
eternal
jostling
and
monotonous
noises
of
the
city
truly
a
vagabond
and
a
savage
is
smith
he
afraid
that
his
family
his
mangy
old
pointer
and
dropsical
cat
will
suffer
in
his
absence
i
scorn
to
answer
such
an
accusation
retorted
smith
i
shall
treat
it
with
dignified
contempt
as
i
do
the
doc
medicines
which
i
never
take
but
always
pay
for
just
to
keep
him
from
starving
and
to
make
him
imagine
he
cures
me
but
speaking
of
cats
reminds
me
of
a
certain
matter
which
occurred
not
many
years
ago
the
doctor
here
if
his
testimony
could
be
relied
upon
knows
that
i
used
to
be
troubled
with
indigestion
and
was
sometimes
a
little
nervous
a
nervous
interrupted
the
doctor
why
he
would
be
as
crazy
with
the
hypo
as
a
march
hare
he
would
insist
that
he
was
going
to
die
or
to
the
almshouse
he
has
made
two
or
three
dozen
wills
to
my
certain
knowledge
under
the
firm
conviction
that
he
would
be
in
the
ground
in
a
week
a
nervous
indeed
well
said
smith
we
wo
quarrel
about
the
degree
of
my
nervousness
but
in
regard
to
what
i
was
going
to
say
about
cats
some
years
ago
i
occupied
a
suite
of
rooms
in
the
second
story
of
a
house
rented
by
a
widow
lady
to
whom
i
had
been
under
some
obligations
in
my
boyhood
and
whom
my
mother
always
regarded
as
her
best
friend
smith
supported
the
excellent
old
lady
in
comfort
for
a
decade
under
pretence
of
boarding
with
her
ministering
to
the
last
years
of
her
life
with
the
care
and
affection
of
a
son
the
landlord
of
the
premises
was
the
owner
of
a
block
of
twelve
houses
six
on
pearl
street
and
six
on
broadway
the
lots
meeting
midway
between
the
two
streets
on
the
rear
of
these
lots
are
the
all
under
a
continuous
flat
roof
some
twelve
feet
high
twenty
wide
and
say
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
in
the
rear
of
the
broadway
are
one
story
or
third
parlors
the
roofs
of
which
form
a
continuous
platform
upon
which
you
can
step
from
the
second
story
of
the
houses
well
said
the
doctor
what
of
all
that
there
a
great
deal
of
it
smith
replied
i
do
pretend
to
know
how
many
cats
there
were
in
the
city
of
albany
indeed
i
never
heard
that
they
were
included
in
the
census
i
do
not
undertake
to
say
that
they
congregated
nightly
on
the
roofs
of
those
but
if
there
was
a
cat
in
the
sixth
ward
that
did
have
something
to
say
on
that
roof
every
night
i
should
like
to
make
its
acquaintance
i
am
against
cats
i
regard
them
as
treacherous
ungrateful
animals
and
as
having
very
small
moral
developments
generally
i
am
against
especially
in
the
night
season
when
honest
people
have
a
right
to
their
natural
sleep
i
do
like
to
be
woke
up
when
rounding
a
pleasant
dream
by
their
growling
and
screaming
spitting
and
whining
groaning
and
crying
and
the
hundred
other
nameless
noises
by
which
they
frighten
sleep
from
our
pillows
well
one
night
it
may
have
been
one
or
two
or
three
i
was
awakened
by
the
awfullest
screaming
and
sputtering
growling
and
swearing
that
ever
startled
a
weary
man
from
his
slumbers
i
leaped
out
of
bed
under
the
impression
that
at
least
twenty
little
children
had
fallen
into
as
many
tubs
of
boiling
water
i
threw
open
the
window
and
stepped
out
upon
the
roof
of
the
i
do
intend
to
exaggerate
but
i
honestly
believe
that
there
were
less
than
three
hundred
cats
over
against
me
on
the
roofs
of
the
each
one
of
which
had
a
tail
bigger
than
a
bologna
sausage
his
back
crooked
up
like
an
oxbow
and
his
great
round
eyes
gleaming
fiercely
in
the
moonlight
putting
in
his
very
best
in
the
way
of
catterwauling
two
of
the
largest
one
black
as
night
and
the
other
a
dark
grey
or
brindle
appeared
to
be
particularly
in
earnest
and
the
way
they
scolded
and
screamed
and
swore
at
each
other
was
a
sin
to
hear
i
wo
undertake
to
report
all
they
said
a
decent
regard
for
the
proprieties
of
language
compels
me
to
give
only
a
sketch
of
the
debate
infernal
thief
screamed
the
grey
like
to
know
what
are
out
here
for
this
time
of
night
skulking
and
creeping
and
nosing
about
in
the
dark
poaching
upon
other
people
preserves
well
i
mighty
well
was
the
reply
to
talk
you
growling
and
sputtering
robber
to
come
upon
this
roof
sticking
up
back
and
taking
airs
on
yourself
like
to
know
what
business
got
to
be
prowling
about
and
crowding
yourself
into
honest
people
company
a
regular
tom
cat
i
have
you
know
and
go
where
i
please
and
i
stand
none
of
your
big
talk
and
insolent
looks
hear
the
cowardly
thief
insolent
very
well
tom
cat
very
good
indeed
now
just
take
your
black
skin
off
of
this
roof
or
you
get
what
will
make
you
look
foe
a
month
off
this
roof
i
think
you
said
look
at
this
set
of
ivory
and
these
claws
old
greyback
if
you
want
i
should
leave
this
roof
just
come
and
put
me
off
try
it
on
old
beeswax
yes
yes
try
it
on
once
and
we
see
whose
eyes
will
look
straightest
in
the
morning
come
on
old
humpback
try
it
on
old
sausage
tail
and
then
they
pitched
in
and
such
scratching
and
growling
scolding
and
swearing
and
biting
and
rolling
over
and
over
i
never
happened
to
see
or
hear
before
about
that
time
i
dropped
a
boulder
of
coal
taken
from
the
scuttle
weighing
about
half
a
pound
right
among
them
accidently
of
course
whether
it
hit
any
one
i
ca
positively
affirm
but
i
heard
a
dull
heavy
sound
a
kind
of
as
if
it
had
struck
against
something
soft
and
the
scream
of
one
of
the
belligerents
was
brought
to
a
sudden
stop
by
a
sort
of
hysterical
jerk
as
though
there
had
been
a
sudden
lack
of
wind
to
carry
it
on
it
put
an
end
to
the
disturbance
and
all
the
rioters
save
one
scampered
away
that
one
remained
all
doubled
up
in
a
heap
like
as
if
it
had
the
sick
headache
or
been
attacked
with
a
sudden
inflammation
of
the
bowels
if
any
body
cat
was
found
the
next
morning
with
a
swelled
head
or
a
great
bunch
on
its
side
and
seemed
dumpish
it
my
private
opinion
that
that
the
one
that
lump
of
coal
fell
upon
still
it
do
much
good
in
the
way
of
relieving
me
from
the
annoyance
of
these
cat
conventions
they
continued
to
congregate
nightly
on
that
long
shed
in
the
rear
of
my
rooms
i
wasted
more
wood
upon
them
than
i
could
well
afford
to
spare
i
used
up
all
the
brickbats
i
could
lay
my
hands
on
i
threw
away
something
less
than
a
ton
of
coal
and
on
two
occasions
came
near
being
taken
to
the
for
smashing
a
window
in
the
opposite
block
all
this
proved
of
no
avail
indeed
my
tormentors
began
at
last
to
get
used
to
it
to
regard
it
as
part
of
the
performance
the
matter
was
getting
serious
it
became
evident
that
either
those
cats
or
myself
must
leave
the
premises
i
had
paid
my
rent
in
advance
and
was
therefore
entitled
to
quiet
use
and
enjoyment
according
to
the
terms
of
my
lease
i
made
up
my
mind
to
try
one
more
experiment
so
i
bought
me
a
gun
and
a
quantity
of
powder
and
shot
and
gave
fair
warning
that
i
intended
to
use
them
well
the
moon
came
up
one
night
with
her
great
round
face
and
went
walking
up
the
sky
with
a
queenly
tread
throwing
her
light
like
a
mantle
of
brightness
over
all
the
earth
i
love
the
calm
of
a
moonlight
night
in
the
pleasant
spring
time
and
the
cats
of
our
part
of
the
town
seemed
to
love
it
too
for
they
came
from
every
quarter
from
the
sheds
around
the
national
garden
from
the
stables
the
streets
the
basements
and
the
kitchens
creeping
stealthily
along
the
tops
of
the
fences
and
along
the
sheds
and
clambering
up
the
boards
that
leaned
up
against
the
outbuildings
and
set
themselves
down
scores
or
less
of
them
in
their
old
trysting
place
right
opposite
my
chamber
windows
to
all
this
i
had
in
the
abstract
no
objection
if
a
cat
chooses
to
take
a
quiet
walk
by
moonlight
if
he
chooses
to
go
out
for
his
pleasure
or
his
profit
it
is
no
particular
business
of
mine
and
i
have
a
word
to
say
cats
have
rights
and
i
have
no
disposition
to
interfere
with
them
if
they
choose
to
hold
a
convention
to
discuss
the
affairs
of
they
can
do
it
for
all
me
but
they
must
go
about
it
decently
and
in
order
they
must
talk
matters
over
calmly
there
must
be
no
rioting
no
fighting
they
must
refrain
from
the
use
of
profane
language
they
must
not
swear
there
law
against
all
this
and
i
had
warned
them
long
before
that
i
would
stand
no
such
nonsense
i
told
them
frankly
that
i
let
drive
among
them
some
night
with
a
gun
loaded
with
powder
and
and
i
meant
it
but
those
cats
believe
a
word
i
said
they
believe
i
had
any
powder
and
shot
they
believe
i
had
any
gun
or
knew
how
to
use
it
if
i
had
and
one
great
maltese
with
eyes
like
and
a
tail
like
a
bologna
sausage
grinned
and
sputtered
and
spit
in
derision
and
defiance
of
my
threats
well
said
i
well
tom
cat
very
well
indeed
on
your
head
be
it
tom
cat
try
it
on
tom
cat
and
we
see
who
get
the
worst
of
it
well
as
i
said
the
moon
came
up
one
night
with
her
great
round
face
and
all
the
little
stars
hid
themselves
as
if
ashamed
of
their
twinkle
in
the
splendor
of
her
superior
brightness
i
retired
when
the
rumble
of
the
carriages
in
the
streets
and
the
tramp
on
the
stone
sidewalks
had
ceased
and
the
scream
of
the
eleven
train
had
died
away
into
silence
with
a
quiet
conscience
and
in
the
confidence
that
i
should
find
that
repose
to
which
one
who
has
wronged
no
man
during
the
day
is
justly
entitled
it
may
have
been
midnight
or
one
or
two
when
i
was
awakened
from
a
pleasant
slumber
by
a
babel
of
unearthly
sounds
in
the
rear
of
my
chamber
i
knew
what
those
sounds
meant
for
they
had
cost
me
fuel
enough
to
have
lasted
a
month
i
raised
the
window
and
there
as
of
old
right
opposite
me
on
the
north
end
of
that
long
shed
was
an
assemblage
of
all
the
cats
in
that
part
of
the
town
i
wo
be
precise
as
to
numbers
but
it
is
my
honest
belief
that
there
was
less
than
three
hundred
of
them
and
if
one
among
them
all
was
silent
i
did
not
succeed
in
discovering
which
it
was
there
was
that
same
old
maltese
with
his
saucer
eyes
and
sausage
tail
and
over
against
him
sat
a
monstrous
brindle
and
off
at
the
right
was
an
old
spotted
ratter
and
on
his
left
was
one
black
as
a
wolf
mouth
all
but
his
eyes
which
glared
with
a
sulphurous
and
lurid
brightness
and
dotted
all
around
over
a
space
some
thirty
feet
square
were
dozens
more
of
all
sizes
and
colors
and
growling
and
spitting
and
shrieking
and
swearing
never
before
broke
with
hideous
discord
the
silence
of
midnight
i
loaded
my
gun
by
i
put
plenty
of
powder
and
a
handful
of
shot
into
each
barrel
i
adjusted
the
caps
carefully
and
stepped
out
of
the
window
upon
the
narrow
roof
upon
which
it
opens
i
was
then
just
eighty
feet
from
that
cat
convention
i
addressed
myself
to
the
chairman
the
old
maltese
in
a
distinct
and
audible
voice
and
said
he
recognise
my
right
to
the
floor
but
went
right
on
with
the
business
of
the
meeting
cried
i
more
emphatically
than
before
but
was
answered
only
by
an
extra
shriek
from
the
chairman
and
a
fiercer
scream
from
the
whole
assembly
once
cried
i
again
as
i
brought
my
gun
to
a
present
twice
and
i
aimed
straight
at
the
chairman
covering
half
a
dozen
others
in
the
range
three
times
and
i
let
drive
bang
went
the
barrel
and
bang
went
the
barrel
such
scampering
such
leaping
off
the
shed
such
running
away
over
the
eaves
of
the
outbuildings
over
the
tops
of
the
were
never
seen
before
the
echoes
of
the
firing
had
scarcely
died
away
when
that
whole
assemblage
was
broken
up
and
dispersed
said
i
the
next
morning
to
the
boy
who
did
chores
for
us
seems
to
be
a
cat
asleep
out
on
that
woodshed
go
up
and
scare
it
away
thomas
clambered
upon
the
shed
and
went
up
to
where
that
cat
lay
and
lifting
it
up
by
the
tail
hallood
back
to
me
cat
ca
be
waked
up
it
ca
be
scared
away
its
dead
after
examining
it
for
a
moment
been
a
shootin
on
it
by
thunder
as
he
tossed
it
down
into
the
yard
you
do
say
so
said
i
that
cat
was
the
old
maltese
the
chairman
of
that
convention
i
do
know
where
he
boarded
or
who
claimed
title
to
him
what
i
do
know
is
that
it
cost
me
a
quarter
to
have
him
buried
or
thrown
into
the
river
and
that
i
was
suffered
to
sleep
in
peace
from
the
time
i
made
the
discovery
that
and
lead
are
great
quellers
of
midnight
they
gave
quiet
at
least
and
saved
me
from
the
wickedness
of
the
nightly
use
of
certain
expletives
under
the
excitement
of
the
occasion
which
are
not
to
be
found
in
any
of
the
religious
works
of
the
day
chapter
xii
the
first
chain
op
ponds
shooting
by
turns
sheep
washing
a
plunge
and
a
dive
a
roland
for
an
oliver
we
started
early
the
next
morning
up
bog
river
intending
to
reach
the
first
chain
of
ponds
some
twenty
miles
deeper
in
the
wilderness
as
the
stream
runs
on
the
banks
of
which
our
pioneer
had
been
instructed
to
pitch
our
tents
this
day
journey
it
was
understood
would
be
a
hard
one
as
there
were
eight
carrying
places
varying
from
ten
rods
to
half
a
mile
in
length
the
bog
river
is
a
deep
sluggish
stream
for
five
or
six
miles
above
the
falls
just
at
the
lake
it
goes
creeping
along
among
and
around
immense
boulders
thrown
loose
as
it
were
in
mid
channel
at
this
distance
the
stream
divides
the
right
hand
channel
leading
to
the
two
chains
of
ponds
and
mud
lake
where
it
takes
its
rise
and
the
left
to
round
pond
and
little
tupper
lake
and
a
dozen
other
nameless
sheets
of
water
laying
higher
up
among
the
mountains
our
course
lay
up
the
right
hand
channel
which
for
half
a
mile
above
the
forks
comes
roaring
and
tumbling
through
a
mountain
gorge
plunging
over
falls
and
whirling
and
surging
among
the
boulders
in
a
descent
of
three
of
four
hundred
feet
in
all
around
these
and
seven
other
rapids
of
greater
or
less
extent
our
boats
had
to
be
carried
we
reached
the
lower
chain
of
ponds
within
an
hour
of
sunset
and
found
our
tents
pitched
at
a
pleasant
spot
which
looked
out
over
the
easternmost
one
of
these
beautiful
little
lakelets
there
are
three
of
them
connected
together
by
narrow
passages
or
straits
the
banks
of
which
as
the
boat
glides
along
the
oars
will
touch
they
are
surrounded
by
low
but
pleasant
hills
so
arranged
as
to
form
a
varied
but
delightful
scenery
from
the
western
one
the
hills
rise
from
the
water
with
a
steep
acclivity
covered
with
a
gigantic
growth
of
timber
save
on
the
northern
side
where
a
pleasant
natural
meadow
covered
with
rank
grass
and
a
few
spruce
and
fir
trees
stretches
away
it
contains
about
two
hundred
acres
and
its
waters
are
deep
and
pure
the
middle
one
though
smaller
is
equally
beautiful
skirted
on
three
sides
with
hills
and
on
the
other
by
a
continuation
of
the
same
natural
meadow
the
eastern
one
on
the
western
banks
of
which
our
tents
were
located
on
a
beautiful
little
bay
is
the
prettiest
of
them
all
it
contains
perhaps
six
hundred
acres
and
the
scenery
around
it
is
exceedingly
cheerful
and
pleasant
the
northern
shore
is
bound
by
a
natural
meadow
of
luxuriant
wild
grass
between
which
and
the
water
is
a
hard
sandy
beach
at
low
water
some
thirty
feet
wide
and
extending
between
a
quarter
and
half
a
mile
in
length
as
we
approached
these
ponds
the
river
became
broad
and
shallow
natural
meadows
covered
with
tall
grass
and
weeds
stretching
away
on
either
hand
when
we
came
to
this
portion
of
the
river
the
oars
were
shipped
and
our
took
their
seats
in
the
stern
with
their
paddles
smith
was
in
the
bow
of
one
boat
and
spalding
in
that
of
the
other
each
with
rifle
in
hand
preparatory
to
the
slaughter
of
a
deer
to
provide
us
with
venison
it
was
arranged
that
the
marksman
who
fired
and
failed
to
secure
his
game
should
change
places
with
the
one
behind
him
and
that
thus
the
rotation
should
go
on
till
we
should
bring
down
a
deer
we
knew
that
we
should
see
numbers
of
them
feeding
along
the
margin
of
the
stream
and
upon
the
natural
meadows
that
skirted
the
shore
the
stream
was
winding
and
tortuous
and
at
no
time
could
we
see
more
than
rods
in
advance
of
us
so
crooked
is
its
course
we
were
moving
up
the
stream
cautiously
and
silently
the
boatman
who
had
charge
of
the
craft
in
which
were
smith
and
myself
seated
in
the
stern
paddling
and
smith
himself
seated
in
the
bow
with
rifle
in
hand
ready
for
anything
that
might
turn
up
as
the
boat
rounded
a
point
a
deer
started
out
from
among
the
reeds
on
the
right
and
went
dashing
and
snorting
across
the
river
directly
in
front
of
the
boat
and
five
or
six
rods
ahead
the
water
being
only
about
two
feet
in
depth
smith
blazed
away
at
him
where
the
ball
went
mercy
knows
but
the
deer
dashed
forward
with
accelerated
speed
and
a
louder
whistle
and
went
crashing
up
the
smith
acknowledged
to
a
severe
attack
of
the
buck
fever
it
was
now
my
turn
to
take
the
next
shot
and
changing
places
with
smith
we
went
ahead
in
ten
minutes
a
chance
to
try
my
skill
occurred
but
it
was
a
long
shot
the
game
was
on
the
wing
and
i
had
no
better
success
than
did
my
friend
the
deer
only
increased
the
length
of
his
bounds
and
he
too
went
plunging
through
the
old
woods
snorting
in
astonishment
and
huge
affright
at
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
our
boat
now
fell
back
and
spalding
and
the
doctor
took
the
lead
in
a
short
time
a
deer
was
discovered
feeding
just
ahead
of
us
on
the
lily
pads
along
the
shore
the
boatman
paddled
silently
up
to
within
eight
or
ten
rods
of
him
spalding
sighted
him
long
and
as
he
averred
carefully
with
his
rifle
the
deer
fed
and
fed
on
and
we
waited
anxiously
to
hear
the
crack
of
the
rifle
and
see
the
deer
go
down
but
still
the
boat
glided
on
unnoticed
by
the
animal
that
was
feeding
in
unsuspecting
security
at
length
he
raised
his
head
threw
forward
his
long
ears
gazed
for
a
second
intently
at
his
enemies
and
then
appreciating
his
danger
snorted
like
a
warhorse
and
plunged
in
a
seeming
desperation
of
terror
towards
the
shore
he
had
ran
a
few
rods
when
spalding
let
drive
at
him
as
he
confessed
at
random
the
ball
went
wide
of
the
mark
and
the
game
dashed
with
more
desperate
energy
and
whistling
and
snorting
like
a
locomotive
into
the
brush
that
lined
the
banks
it
was
spalding
third
shot
in
all
his
life
at
a
deer
and
he
insisted
gravely
enough
that
he
did
not
fire
while
the
game
was
standing
broadside
to
him
on
account
of
his
desire
to
give
the
animal
a
chance
for
his
life
the
truth
is
that
spalding
had
a
bad
a
very
bad
attack
of
the
aforesaid
buck
fever
the
doctor
by
rotation
now
became
the
leading
marksman
he
was
cool
and
calm
as
if
going
to
perform
some
delicate
surgical
operation
we
soon
came
in
sight
of
a
buck
feeding
in
a
shallow
pasture
and
the
boat
glided
quietly
within
fifteen
rods
of
it
the
doctor
hand
was
firm
and
his
aim
steady
there
was
about
him
none
of
that
nervous
agitation
which
is
so
apt
to
disturb
the
first
efforts
at
deer
slaying
the
boat
came
to
a
pause
a
moment
when
his
rule
rang
out
quick
and
sharp
waking
the
echoes
of
the
mountains
around
and
reverberating
along
the
shore
at
the
crack
of
the
rifle
the
buck
leaped
high
into
the
air
and
plunged
madly
towards
the
bank
up
which
he
dashed
with
a
prodigious
bound
made
a
single
jump
among
the
tall
grass
and
disappeared
from
the
sight
the
doctor
was
greatly
mortified
supposing
he
had
missed
he
declared
solemnly
that
he
had
taken
steady
and
sure
aim
just
back
of
the
of
the
deer
had
a
perfect
sight
upon
it
and
that
it
did
not
fall
in
its
tracks
could
only
be
owing
to
its
bearing
a
charmed
life
the
boatman
however
knew
that
the
animal
from
its
actions
was
mortally
wounded
he
said
nothing
but
paddled
quietly
to
the
shore
and
there
just
over
the
bank
in
the
tall
grass
and
weeds
lay
the
noble
buck
stone
dead
he
had
gone
down
and
died
without
a
struggle
a
proud
man
was
the
doctor
as
he
passed
his
across
the
throat
of
the
deer
and
gazed
upon
its
broad
antlers
now
in
the
velvet
pointing
to
the
course
of
the
ball
right
through
its
vitals
in
on
one
side
and
out
on
the
other
we
had
venison
for
the
next
hours
and
we
disturbed
the
deer
no
more
that
afternoon
the
deep
baying
of
the
as
we
entered
the
little
lake
apprised
us
of
the
location
of
our
tents
and
we
were
glad
to
reach
them
and
stretch
our
limbs
upon
the
bed
of
boughs
beneath
them
for
the
day
had
been
warm
and
our
journey
a
weary
one
our
pioneer
had
made
the
entire
journey
the
day
before
though
he
had
to
pass
over
all
the
three
times
we
found
that
he
had
killed
two
deer
and
had
the
meat
from
them
cut
into
thin
slips
undergoing
the
process
of
jerking
in
a
bark
smokehouse
erected
near
the
tents
he
had
also
a
beautiful
string
of
trout
ready
for
our
supper
taken
in
a
way
peculiarly
his
own
he
had
used
neither
bait
nor
fly
after
supper
as
we
sat
looking
out
over
the
lake
in
front
of
our
tents
the
doctor
inquired
of
our
pioneer
how
he
had
taken
his
fish
as
he
had
with
him
neither
rod
nor
flies
and
there
was
no
bait
to
be
found
in
the
woods
proper
for
trout
why
said
he
i
got
lonesome
yesterday
all
alone
up
here
in
the
woods
waiting
for
you
and
i
thought
i
take
a
look
around
the
shore
of
the
lake
thinking
i
might
find
a
gold
mine
or
a
pocketful
of
diamonds
or
something
of
that
sort
so
i
took
my
rifle
and
the
two
dogs
and
started
on
an
explorin
voyage
i
did
find
any
gold
but
i
found
just
across
there
by
those
willows
and
alders
a
cold
stream
entered
the
lake
and
right
in
the
mouth
of
it
the
trout
were
lyin
as
thick
as
your
fingers
they
were
fine
little
fellows
as
i
ever
happened
to
see
weighing
about
a
quarter
of
a
pound
each
i
had
a
hook
or
two
and
a
piece
of
twine
in
my
pocket
but
they
were
of
no
sort
of
use
in
common
fishin
for
i
had
no
kind
of
bait
and
get
any
after
thinking
the
matter
over
i
concluded
i
see
if
i
could
bag
some
of
them
in
a
quiet
way
so
i
cut
me
a
long
pole
tied
the
hook
and
line
to
the
end
of
it
and
reaching
out
over
the
water
dropped
quietly
down
among
them
i
let
the
line
drift
gently
up
against
the
one
i
wanted
he
did
seem
to
mind
it
but
was
rather
pleased
as
the
line
tickled
his
sides
after
letting
it
lay
there
a
moment
i
jerked
suddenly
and
up
came
the
trout
clean
over
my
head
on
to
the
flat
rock
behind
me
however
this
might
have
astonished
him
it
did
seem
to
disturb
the
rest
in
that
way
i
caught
all
i
wanted
and
could
have
caught
a
bushel
it
is
a
very
science
way
of
fishin
but
it
answers
when
a
man
is
hungry
and
has
got
any
bait
or
fly
i
scarcely
know
why
said
the
doctor
but
cullen
account
of
catching
his
trout
reminds
me
of
a
circumstance
which
occurred
when
i
was
a
boy
and
which
for
the
moment
made
a
deal
of
sport
i
have
not
probably
thought
of
it
in
twenty
years
but
it
comes
to
me
now
as
fresh
as
though
it
were
the
occurrence
of
yesterday
it
must
be
as
hank
wood
said
the
other
day
that
a
thing
which
gets
fairly
anchored
in
a
man
mind
remains
there
always
and
covered
up
as
it
may
be
by
other
and
later
things
it
can
never
be
forgotten
it
will
come
drifting
back
on
the
current
of
memory
fresh
and
palpable
as
ever
everybody
understands
or
ought
to
understand
how
sheep
are
washed
a
small
yard
is
built
on
the
bank
of
a
stream
adjacent
to
a
deep
place
one
side
of
which
is
open
to
the
water
and
into
which
the
flock
is
crowded
the
washers
take
their
places
in
the
water
where
it
is
three
or
four
feet
deep
and
the
sheep
are
caught
by
others
and
tossed
to
them
where
they
undergo
ablution
an
operation
by
the
way
that
they
do
not
seem
altogether
to
enjoy
to
wash
the
dirt
and
gum
from
their
fleeces
on
such
occasions
it
is
regarded
as
a
lawful
thing
a
standing
and
ancient
practical
joke
to
pitch
any
outsider
who
may
happen
to
indulge
his
curiosity
by
stopping
to
look
on
into
the
stream
if
he
is
verdant
he
will
be
very
likely
to
be
inveigled
into
the
yard
and
in
an
unguarded
moment
be
made
to
take
an
involuntary
dive
head
foremost
into
the
water
a
few
rods
above
the
place
in
which
my
father
washed
his
sheep
was
an
old
dam
the
apron
of
which
remained
and
beneath
which
was
a
basin
some
five
or
six
feet
in
depth
and
thirty
or
forty
feet
in
diameter
filled
of
course
with
water
on
one
occasion
a
man
who
was
employed
to
catch
the
sheep
was
one
of
those
shiftless
lazy
fellows
to
be
found
in
almost
every
neighborhood
who
prefer
smoking
and
telling
stories
in
to
regular
work
and
who
greatly
prefer
odd
jobs
to
consecutive
labor
tom
g
was
one
of
this
genus
full
of
fun
and
mischief
but
without
a
particle
of
real
malice
in
his
composition
as
he
was
busy
throwing
sheep
to
the
washers
a
young
fellow
from
the
neighboring
village
happened
that
way
and
becoming
somewhat
interested
in
the
process
was
seduced
by
tom
g
inside
of
the
yard
to
try
his
hand
at
catching
and
tossing
in
sheep
about
the
second
or
third
one
he
operated
upon
his
treacherous
friend
stumbled
against
him
giving
him
a
tremendous
push
and
with
a
sheep
in
his
arms
he
drove
head
foremost
among
the
washers
the
water
was
cold
and
there
was
a
good
deal
of
puffing
and
blowing
about
the
time
his
head
came
above
the
surface
he
was
a
sensible
chap
and
took
the
joke
as
a
wise
man
should
especially
when
the
odds
are
all
against
him
albeit
it
was
somewhat
rude
he
came
out
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
and
after
joining
in
the
laugh
against
himself
and
taking
off
and
wringing
his
garments
he
wandered
up
to
the
apron
of
the
old
dam
and
stretching
himself
along
the
planks
went
to
looking
anxiously
down
into
the
deep
water
after
a
while
he
seemed
to
have
discovered
something
and
called
out
to
his
friend
below
say
tom
have
you
got
a
fishhook
in
your
pocket
here
is
a
trout
that
will
weigh
two
pounds
and
i
want
to
hook
him
up
now
tom
was
a
fisherman
and
a
big
trout
was
his
weakness
moreover
he
was
never
without
half
a
dozen
hooks
and
lines
in
his
pockets
he
left
his
business
at
once
and
went
up
to
the
apron
to
assist
in
taking
the
trout
a
pole
was
cut
and
a
couple
of
feet
of
line
with
a
hook
attached
was
fastened
a
little
way
from
the
top
and
the
haft
of
the
hook
stuck
into
the
end
so
that
by
a
little
force
it
might
be
removed
and
tom
and
his
friend
got
upon
the
apron
and
stooped
over
to
see
where
the
great
trout
lay
he
is
tom
just
under
the
edge
of
this
rock
tom
stretched
himself
over
to
get
a
view
of
the
fish
when
a
vigorous
shove
from
the
rear
sent
him
like
a
great
frog
plump
towards
the
bottom
of
the
pool
this
was
a
consummation
that
tom
had
not
bargained
for
but
there
was
no
alternative
but
to
swim
for
the
shore
dripping
like
a
rat
from
a
flooded
sewer
that
joke
had
two
points
to
it
and
tom
g
had
the
worst
of
them
your
anecdote
said
smith
reminds
me
of
one
in
which
i
was
an
actor
and
which
was
impressed
upon
my
mind
by
a
process
which
few
boys
are
fond
of
but
which
is
very
apt
to
make
the
impression
durable
fished
for
trout
once
without
line
or
hook
i
got
a
fine
string
of
them
and
myself
into
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
in
the
bargain
on
my
father
farm
as
it
was
when
i
was
a
boy
was
a
stream
that
came
down
through
a
gorge
in
the
mountains
that
bounded
the
pleasant
valley
in
which
that
farm
lay
in
the
spring
freshets
and
the
summer
rains
that
stream
was
a
mighty
and
resistless
torrent
that
came
roaring
and
plunging
down
from
the
plain
above
cascading
and
leaping
down
ledges
and
rushing
though
a
gorge
on
either
side
of
which
precipices
of
solid
rock
stood
straight
up
two
hundred
feet
in
height
it
was
a
goodly
sight
to
see
that
stream
when
its
back
was
up
come
rushing
and
foaming
a
mighty
flood
from
the
deep
and
shadowy
gulf
rolling
in
its
resistless
course
great
boulders
of
tons
upon
tons
in
weight
and
eddying
and
twisting
and
roaring
onward
in
its
furious
course
towards
the
lake
in
the
summer
time
the
drouth
lapped
up
its
waters
and
it
dried
away
to
a
little
brook
trickling
over
the
falls
and
went
winding
a
small
streamlet
around
the
base
of
the
hill
sometimes
it
disappeared
in
the
gravel
or
among
the
loose
stones
save
here
and
there
a
pool
of
narrow
limits
and
shallow
depth
it
was
a
fine
trout
stream
at
times
its
waters
were
cold
and
pure
and
the
brook
trout
loved
to
hide
away
under
the
great
smooth
stones
or
shelving
rocks
and
be
comfortable
in
the
shade
when
the
summer
sun
was
hot
and
fiery
in
the
sky
when
the
creek
was
low
they
would
congregate
in
the
pools
and
still
places
and
in
times
of
extreme
drouth
might
be
seen
huddled
together
in
such
places
in
great
numbers
my
father
though
not
a
member
of
any
church
was
strict
in
his
family
discipline
in
regard
to
the
observance
of
the
sabbath
the
breach
of
which
on
the
part
of
his
children
was
very
apt
to
be
followed
by
consequences
not
the
most
pleasant
in
the
world
for
he
held
that
a
good
switch
was
an
essential
article
of
household
furniture
and
its
occasional
use
a
cardinal
principle
in
the
philosophy
of
family
rule
one
sunday
when
i
was
some
ten
or
eleven
years
old
when
the
old
people
were
gone
to
meeting
and
they
had
to
go
eight
miles
to
find
a
meeting
house
i
with
an
older
brother
tired
of
lying
around
the
house
concluded
to
take
a
stroll
along
up
the
brook
it
was
a
time
of
severe
drouth
and
the
stream
was
dried
up
save
here
and
there
a
small
pool
clear
and
cold
the
bottom
of
which
consisted
of
smooth
and
stones
and
pebbles
in
one
of
these
was
a
number
of
beautiful
speckled
trout
averaging
maybe
a
quarter
of
a
pound
each
in
weight
here
was
a
temptation
too
strong
to
be
resisted
we
had
no
hooks
or
lines
with
us
and
would
not
have
ventured
to
use
them
if
we
had
that
would
have
been
fishing
but
the
taking
of
those
trout
with
our
hands
was
quite
another
matter
so
rolling
our
pants
up
above
our
knees
there
was
no
use
of
talking
about
shoes
and
stockings
such
luxuries
were
not
within
the
range
of
indulgence
to
boys
of
our
age
in
those
days
save
in
the
frosts
and
snows
of
winter
and
stubbed
toes
stone
bruises
and
thorns
in
the
feet
come
floating
along
down
from
the
long
past
like
shadows
of
darkness
on
the
current
of
memory
by
the
way
will
some
rich
man
who
was
reared
in
the
country
in
the
good
old
times
when
boys
went
barefooted
in
the
summer
months
when
chapped
feet
stone
bruises
stubbed
toes
and
thorns
that
pierced
and
festered
in
their
were
the
great
ills
that
deepest
around
human
destiny
solve
for
me
a
problem
of
the
human
mind
will
he
tell
me
whether
in
his
after
life
when
he
was
the
owner
of
broad
acres
fine
houses
piles
of
stocks
in
paying
corporations
and
huge
deposits
in
solvent
banks
he
ever
felt
richer
or
prouder
when
counting
his
gains
and
contemplating
the
aggregate
of
his
wealth
than
he
did
when
he
pulled
on
his
first
pair
of
boots
so
as
i
said
we
rolled
up
our
pants
and
waded
in
for
the
trout
we
caught
a
beautiful
string
of
twenty
or
more
took
them
home
dressed
them
nicely
and
sat
them
carefully
away
in
the
cool
cellar
we
had
a
notion
that
the
greatness
of
the
prize
would
wipe
away
the
offence
by
which
it
was
secured
and
that
the
delicious
breakfast
they
would
afford
would
be
received
as
a
sufficient
atonement
for
the
sin
of
having
taken
them
on
a
sunday
but
we
were
never
more
mistaken
in
our
lives
my
father
went
into
the
cellar
for
some
purpose
in
the
evening
after
his
return
from
meeting
and
discovered
the
trout
an
inquiry
was
instituted
our
dereliction
was
exposed
and
we
were
promised
a
flogging
now
that
was
a
promise
which
while
it
was
rarely
made
was
never
broken
when
my
father
in
his
calm
quiet
way
made
up
his
mind
and
so
expressed
it
that
he
owed
one
of
his
boys
a
flogging
it
became
as
it
were
a
debt
of
honor
what
in
modern
parlance
would
be
termed
a
confidential
debt
and
he
to
whom
it
was
acknowledged
to
be
due
became
a
prefered
creditor
and
was
sure
to
be
paid
well
the
trout
were
eaten
for
breakfast
and
after
the
meal
was
over
my
brother
and
myself
were
duly
paid
off
at
a
hundred
cents
on
the
dollar
with
full
interest
that
flogging
cured
me
of
trout
especially
on
sunday
i
am
never
tempted
to
take
trout
with
my
hands
without
feeling
a
tickling
sensation
about
the
back
and
though
old
recollections
of
the
long
past
of
that
pleasant
stream
and
the
gorge
through
which
it
flowed
with
the
side
hill
covered
with
old
forests
above
it
and
the
green
fields
spread
out
on
the
other
side
of
the
home
of
my
boyhood
the
old
the
cattle
the
sheep
the
old
and
the
thousand
other
things
around
which
memory
loves
to
linger
come
clustering
around
my
heart
yet
conspicuous
among
them
all
is
the
flogging
i
got
for
trout
on
a
sunday
chapter
xiii
a
jolly
time
for
the
deer
hunting
on
the
water
by
daylight
mud
lake
funereal
scenery
a
new
way
of
taking
rabbits
the
negro
and
the
marino
buck
a
collision
as
we
came
down
to
the
lake
in
the
morning
to
perform
our
ablations
we
saw
a
fine
deer
on
the
opposite
shore
feeding
upon
the
pond
lilies
that
grew
along
in
the
shallow
water
it
was
nearly
half
a
mile
from
us
and
while
we
were
looking
at
it
four
others
came
walking
carelessly
out
of
the
tall
grass
upon
the
beach
and
commenced
playing
as
we
have
seen
lambs
do
on
the
sandy
shore
they
would
run
here
and
there
back
and
forth
at
full
speed
along
the
sands
leap
high
into
the
air
kicking
up
their
heels
and
performing
all
the
various
antics
of
which
animals
so
supple
and
active
may
be
supposed
capable
we
saw
one
fellow
leap
with
a
clear
bound
over
two
that
were
standing
looking
out
over
the
water
and
run
some
fifty
rods
up
the
beach
as
if
all
the
hounds
in
christendom
were
at
his
tail
and
then
wheel
gracefully
and
return
with
equal
speed
to
his
companions
when
they
all
commenced
jumping
and
bounding
and
running
up
and
down
along
the
shore
as
if
they
were
out
on
a
regular
spree
and
were
determined
to
be
jolly
after
half
an
hour
of
exceedingly
active
play
they
hoisted
their
white
flags
and
went
bounding
over
the
meadow
into
the
woods
the
deer
that
was
feeding
paid
no
further
attention
to
them
than
to
raise
his
head
and
look
quietly
and
perhaps
contemptuously
at
them
occasionally
while
he
chewed
his
breakfast
that
he
was
picking
up
in
the
shape
of
lily
pads
upon
the
surface
of
the
water
spalding
and
a
boatman
paddled
across
the
lake
to
make
mm
a
morning
call
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
one
skilled
in
the
art
will
paddle
or
scull
one
of
these
light
boats
to
within
a
few
rods
of
a
deer
while
feeding
in
plain
open
sight
provided
always
that
the
wind
blows
the
direction
of
the
animal
and
no
noise
is
made
by
the
boatman
the
deer
will
feed
on
and
the
time
for
paddling
is
while
his
head
is
down
when
he
raises
it
to
look
about
him
in
whatever
position
the
boatman
is
he
must
remain
immovable
if
his
paddle
is
up
it
must
remain
so
not
a
motion
must
be
made
or
the
game
will
be
off
with
a
snort
and
a
rush
for
the
shore
and
the
woods
the
deer
may
and
probably
will
look
with
a
vacant
stare
directly
at
the
approaching
boat
without
its
curiosity
being
in
the
least
excited
and
then
go
to
feeding
again
the
marksman
must
take
his
aim
while
the
game
is
feeding
when
it
raises
its
head
high
in
the
air
throws
forward
its
ears
and
gazes
at
him
for
a
moment
with
a
wild
and
startled
look
then
is
his
time
to
fire
five
seconds
at
the
longest
is
all
that
is
allowed
him
when
he
sees
these
motions
for
within
that
time
with
its
fears
thoroughly
aroused
the
game
will
be
plunging
for
the
shelter
of
the
woods
the
boatman
paddled
spalding
quietly
and
silently
to
within
twelve
or
fifteen
rods
of
the
deer
that
was
feeding
when
a
column
of
white
smoke
shot
suddenly
up
from
the
bow
of
the
boat
the
sharp
crack
of
the
rifle
rung
out
over
the
water
and
the
deer
went
down
spalding
was
a
proud
man
as
he
returned
to
us
with
a
fine
fat
spike
buck
in
his
boat
these
little
lakes
are
probably
miles
from
the
settlements
allowing
for
the
winding
course
of
the
rivers
just
above
where
the
river
enters
is
a
dam
built
of
logs
some
fifteen
feet
high
erected
by
the
lumbermen
the
last
winter
to
hold
back
the
water
so
as
to
float
their
logs
down
from
this
to
tupper
lake
and
so
on
down
the
rackett
to
the
mills
away
below
around
this
dam
is
the
last
carrying
place
between
this
and
mud
lake
over
which
our
boatmen
trudged
with
their
boats
like
great
turtles
with
their
shells
upon
their
backs
this
is
still
called
bog
river
and
though
above
the
dam
to
mud
lake
where
it
takes
its
rise
it
is
deep
and
sluggish
yet
it
is
doing
it
honor
overmuch
to
dignify
it
by
the
name
of
a
river
it
was
large
enough
however
to
float
our
little
craft
we
left
our
here
with
most
of
our
luggage
to
perfect
his
operations
in
the
way
of
jerking
venison
intending
to
return
the
next
day
we
might
have
left
everything
without
a
guard
so
far
as
human
depredations
were
concerned
no
bolts
or
bars
would
be
necessary
for
its
protection
in
the
first
place
nobody
would
visit
the
spot
and
if
they
did
our
property
would
be
perfectly
protected
by
the
law
of
the
woods
it
would
be
doubtless
carefully
inspected
by
any
curious
banter
passing
that
way
but
theft
or
robbery
are
unknown
here
true
a
bottle
of
good
liquor
if
handled
by
a
visitor
might
lose
somewhat
of
its
contents
but
it
would
be
drank
to
the
health
of
the
owner
and
in
a
spirit
of
good
fellowship
and
not
of
theft
all
which
would
be
regarded
by
woodsmen
as
strictly
within
rule
there
being
as
hank
wood
said
no
law
agin
it
we
left
the
first
chain
of
ponds
and
rowed
some
ten
miles
up
the
deep
and
sluggish
but
narrow
channel
of
the
river
startling
every
little
way
a
deer
from
its
propriety
by
our
presence
as
it
was
feeding
along
the
shore
few
sportsmen
ever
visit
this
remote
region
and
it
is
above
the
range
of
the
lumbermen
we
came
to
some
rapids
near
the
outlet
of
the
second
chain
of
ponds
around
which
we
walked
and
up
which
the
boatmen
pushed
their
little
craft
these
rapids
are
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
with
no
great
amount
of
fall
but
still
enough
to
prevent
the
passage
up
them
of
a
loaded
boat
directly
at
the
head
of
these
rapids
is
the
second
chain
of
ponds
three
pleasant
little
lakelets
of
from
two
to
four
hundred
acres
each
surrounded
by
dense
forests
and
shores
in
the
main
walled
in
by
huge
boulders
and
broken
rocks
we
passed
through
these
in
which
were
several
loons
or
great
northern
divers
quietly
floating
and
as
they
watched
us
sending
forth
their
clear
and
clarion
voices
over
the
water
we
took
each
a
passing
shot
at
them
but
with
no
other
effect
than
to
make
them
dive
quicker
and
deeper
and
stay
under
longer
than
usual
at
the
flash
of
our
rifles
they
would
go
down
and
in
a
few
minutes
would
be
again
on
the
surface
sixty
rods
from
us
laughing
aloud
as
it
were
with
their
clear
and
quavering
voices
at
our
impotent
attempts
to
shoot
them
we
left
the
second
chain
of
ponds
by
the
narrow
and
sluggish
inlets
still
the
bog
river
here
so
small
that
the
boatman
oars
spanned
the
narrow
channel
and
as
crooked
a
stream
as
it
is
possible
for
one
to
be
it
flows
for
miles
through
a
low
and
marshy
region
with
dense
alderbushes
clustering
along
the
shore
and
scattering
dead
at
the
top
standing
between
these
and
the
forests
in
the
background
the
bottom
much
of
the
way
is
of
clean
yellow
sand
in
which
are
imbedded
millions
of
clams
resembling
in
every
respect
those
of
the
ocean
beach
some
of
these
we
opened
and
found
the
living
bivalves
in
appearance
precisely
like
their
kindred
of
the
salt
water
i
have
seen
occasionally
muscle
shells
in
other
streams
and
along
the
shores
of
the
lakes
but
i
never
before
saw
any
such
as
these
save
near
the
ocean
where
the
salt
water
ebbs
and
flows
and
not
even
there
in
such
quantities
one
might
gather
barrels
and
barrels
of
them
large
and
apparently
fat
and
yet
there
would
be
hundreds
or
thousands
of
barrels
left
the
mink
the
muskrat
and
other
animals
that
hunt
along
the
water
and
have
a
taste
for
fish
have
a
good
time
of
it
among
them
for
we
saw
bushels
of
shells
in
places
where
the
fish
had
been
extracted
and
devoured
we
arrived
at
mud
lake
towards
evening
and
pitched
our
tent
on
a
little
rise
of
ground
on
the
north
side
a
few
rods
back
from
the
lake
among
a
cluster
of
spruce
and
balsam
and
surrounded
by
a
dense
growth
of
laurel
and
high
whortleberry
bushes
we
saw
a
deer
occasionally
on
our
route
and
the
banks
of
the
stream
in
many
places
were
trodden
up
by
them
like
the
entrance
to
a
why
this
sheet
of
water
should
be
called
mud
lake
is
a
mystery
for
though
gloomy
enough
in
every
other
respect
its
bed
is
of
sand
and
it
is
surrounded
by
a
sandy
beach
from
fifteen
to
forty
feet
wide
it
is
perhaps
four
miles
in
circumference
its
waters
generally
shallow
and
so
covered
with
pond
lilies
and
skirted
with
wild
grass
as
to
form
the
most
luxuriant
pasture
for
the
deer
and
moose
to
be
found
in
all
this
region
of
all
the
lakes
i
have
visited
in
these
northern
wilds
this
is
the
most
gloomy
indeed
it
is
the
only
one
that
does
not
wear
a
cheerful
and
pleasant
aspect
it
seems
to
be
the
highest
water
in
this
portion
of
the
wilderness
lying
as
one
of
our
boatmen
expressed
it
up
on
the
top
of
the
house
in
only
one
direction
could
any
higher
land
be
seen
and
that
was
a
low
hill
on
the
western
shore
not
exceeding
fifty
feet
in
height
there
are
no
tall
mountain
peaks
reaching
their
heads
towards
the
clouds
overlooking
the
waters
no
ranges
stretching
away
into
the
distance
no
gorges
or
spreading
valleys
no
sloping
hillsides
giving
back
the
sunlight
or
along
which
gigantic
shadows
of
the
drifting
clouds
float
all
around
it
are
fir
and
tamarac
and
spruce
of
a
stinted
and
slender
growth
dead
at
the
top
and
with
lichens
and
moss
hanging
down
in
sad
and
draggled
festoons
from
their
desolate
branches
it
is
in
truth
a
gloomy
place
typical
of
desolation
which
it
is
well
to
see
once
but
which
no
one
will
desire
to
visit
a
second
time
we
noticed
on
the
sandy
beach
tracks
of
the
wolf
the
panther
the
moose
and
in
one
place
the
huge
track
of
a
bear
he
must
have
been
of
monstrous
growth
judging
by
the
impression
of
his
great
feet
and
claws
in
the
sand
but
we
saw
none
of
these
animals
and
so
gloomy
is
the
place
so
sepulchral
such
an
air
of
desolation
all
around
that
it
brings
over
the
mind
a
strong
feeling
of
sadness
and
gloom
and
we
resolved
not
to
tarry
beyond
the
nest
morning
even
for
the
chance
of
taking
a
moose
a
panther
or
a
bear
we
pitched
our
tent
as
i
said
a
little
way
back
from
the
lake
near
a
cold
spring
that
came
boiling
up
through
the
white
sand
in
a
little
basin
eight
feet
wide
the
bottom
of
which
like
that
on
the
bank
of
tupper
lake
was
all
in
commotion
boiling
and
bubbling
as
the
water
forced
its
way
up
through
it
i
was
in
the
forward
boat
as
we
approached
the
lake
and
was
surprised
to
see
the
number
of
deer
feeding
upon
the
lily
pads
in
the
shallow
water
and
the
wild
grass
that
grew
along
the
shore
some
stood
midside
in
the
water
some
with
only
the
line
of
their
backs
and
heads
above
it
some
were
close
along
the
shore
feeding
upon
the
grass
that
grew
there
others
still
were
nibbling
at
the
leaves
of
the
moosewood
upon
the
bank
and
one
large
buck
stood
by
the
side
of
a
fir
tree
rubbing
his
neck
up
and
down
against
it
as
if
scratching
himself
against
its
rough
bark
we
had
not
been
discovered
and
waited
for
the
other
boats
to
arrive
great
was
the
astonishment
of
my
companions
when
they
saw
the
number
of
deer
that
were
feeding
in
this
little
lake
neither
of
them
had
ever
seen
the
like
nor
had
i
save
on
one
occasion
and
that
was
in
a
small
lake
the
name
of
which
i
have
forgotten
lying
a
few
miles
beyond
the
head
of
the
upper
saranac
you
see
that
clump
of
low
balsam
trees
on
that
point
yonder
said
my
boatman
as
we
lay
upon
our
oars
pointing
in
the
direction
indicated
well
from
that
spot
three
years
ago
i
shot
a
moose
out
upon
the
bar
there
as
it
was
feeding
upon
the
lily
pads
and
flag
grass
i
had
heard
from
an
old
indian
hunter
about
this
lake
and
the
abundance
of
game
to
be
found
here
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
see
it
so
another
hunter
and
myself
agreed
to
come
up
here
in
july
and
take
a
look
at
matters
and
find
out
whether
the
old
copperhead
told
the
truth
or
not
we
started
about
the
middle
of
july
with
our
rifles
and
provisions
for
a
fortnight
and
came
up
we
saw
any
quantity
of
deer
on
the
way
on
the
second
chain
of
ponds
we
saw
as
we
were
rowing
along
a
large
panther
walk
out
on
to
the
top
of
a
great
boulder
and
look
around
lashing
his
sides
with
his
long
tail
and
then
sit
down
on
his
haunches
with
his
tail
curled
around
his
feet
just
as
seen
a
cat
do
he
was
too
far
off
for
us
to
shoot
him
and
he
saw
us
before
we
got
within
proper
distance
and
stole
away
into
the
woods
and
we
passed
on
as
we
rounded
the
point
just
below
the
lake
there
and
looked
out
upon
the
broad
water
i
saw
the
moose
i
spoke
of
feeding
we
sat
perfectly
still
and
permitted
the
boat
to
drift
back
down
the
stream
until
we
were
out
of
sight
we
then
landed
and
i
crept
carefully
and
silently
to
that
clump
of
fir
trees
i
had
my
own
and
my
companion
rifle
both
properly
loaded
having
got
a
right
position
i
sighted
for
a
vital
part
and
fired
the
animal
rushed
furiously
forward
two
or
three
rods
with
its
head
lowered
as
if
making
a
lunge
at
an
enemy
then
stopped
and
looked
all
around
standing
with
its
back
humped
up
and
its
short
stump
of
a
tail
working
and
writhing
at
a
furious
rate
i
sighted
it
again
with
the
other
rifle
and
pulled
the
animal
plunged
furiously
for
again
for
a
few
rods
stopped
a
moment
and
then
settled
slowly
down
and
fell
over
on
its
side
dead
it
was
a
and
would
weigh
as
killed
five
or
six
hundred
pounds
i
was
a
pretty
proud
man
then
as
that
was
my
first
moose
and
about
as
big
feeling
a
chap
as
was
squire
smith
the
other
day
when
he
brought
down
that
buck
i
have
shot
two
others
here
since
one
at
each
visit
i
have
made
the
season
for
moose
hunting
along
the
water
pastures
was
nearly
over
they
go
back
upon
the
hills
in
august
the
food
there
being
by
that
time
abundant
the
tracks
we
saw
were
old
ones
the
animals
having
passed
there
several
days
previously
i
would
not
have
it
supposed
that
the
moose
are
abundant
in
any
portion
of
this
wilderness
they
have
come
to
be
few
and
far
between
and
exceedingly
wary
at
that
i
could
hear
of
none
having
been
killed
the
present
season
but
that
there
are
some
left
as
well
as
bears
and
wolves
and
panthers
the
tracks
we
saw
gave
unmistakable
evidence
we
saw
no
appearance
of
trout
in
this
lake
or
in
the
outlet
of
it
above
the
upper
chain
of
ponds
the
stream
swarmed
with
chub
and
dace
a
rare
circumstance
with
the
streams
of
this
region
towards
evening
we
saw
numbers
of
little
grey
wood
rabbits
hopping
around
among
the
dense
undergrowth
on
the
ridge
where
our
tents
were
situated
squatting
themselves
down
and
cocking
up
their
long
ears
as
they
paused
occasionally
to
examine
the
strange
visitors
who
had
come
among
them
they
were
very
tame
not
seeming
to
regard
our
presence
as
a
thing
of
much
danger
to
them
seeing
those
rabbits
remarked
smith
reminds
me
of
an
anecdote
of
my
boyhood
which
at
the
time
occasioned
me
an
amount
of
mortification
equalled
only
by
the
amusement
it
affords
me
when
i
think
of
it
in
after
years
on
my
father
farm
was
a
bush
field
a
place
that
had
been
chopped
and
burned
over
and
then
left
to
grow
up
with
bushes
making
an
excellent
cover
for
wild
wood
rabbits
i
had
seen
them
hopping
about
when
i
went
to
turn
away
the
cows
in
the
morning
or
after
them
at
night
i
had
a
longing
to
game
of
them
i
had
a
brother
a
good
deal
older
than
myself
who
was
as
fond
of
a
joke
as
i
was
of
the
rabbits
and
who
was
quite
as
ready
to
make
game
of
me
as
i
was
of
them
so
he
told
me
one
day
to
put
an
apple
on
a
stick
over
their
paths
high
enough
to
be
just
above
their
reach
and
a
handful
of
scotch
snuff
on
a
dry
leaf
on
the
ground
under
it
and
the
rabbits
while
smelling
for
the
apple
would
inhale
the
snuff
and
sneeze
themselves
to
death
in
no
tune
well
i
was
a
child
then
and
simple
enough
to
be
gammoned
by
this
rigmarole
i
set
the
apple
and
the
snuff
but
i
got
no
rabbit
while
i
did
get
laughed
at
hugely
for
my
credulity
this
satisfied
me
that
people
should
never
impose
upon
the
simplicity
of
childhood
i
remember
my
mortification
on
the
occasion
it
was
so
long
ago
that
it
stands
out
by
itself
a
mere
fragment
of
memory
with
beyond
it
a
blank
and
a
wide
gap
out
this
side
it
is
an
isolated
fact
fixed
in
my
recollection
by
the
pain
it
occasioned
me
your
anecdote
of
the
rabbits
said
the
doctor
reminds
me
of
a
story
told
of
a
dutchman
who
discovered
an
owl
on
a
limb
above
him
and
noticed
that
its
face
and
great
round
eyes
followed
him
always
as
he
walked
around
the
tree
without
its
body
moving
at
all
seeing
this
he
concluded
in
his
wisdom
that
he
would
travel
round
the
tree
till
the
owl
twisted
its
head
off
in
watching
him
so
round
and
round
he
went
for
an
hour
and
stopped
only
by
having
the
conviction
forced
upon
his
mind
that
the
owl
had
a
swivel
in
its
neck
strange
remarked
spalding
how
the
hearing
of
one
story
reminds
us
of
another
i
always
admired
the
nights
because
the
stories
contained
in
that
work
hang
together
so
like
a
string
of
onions
or
a
braid
of
seed
corn
the
first
is
a
sort
of
introduction
to
the
second
and
the
second
an
usher
to
the
third
and
so
on
through
the
whole
but
why
the
story
of
the
dutchman
and
the
owl
should
remind
me
of
another
in
which
an
old
negro
and
a
bellicose
ram
were
the
actors
is
a
matter
i
do
not
pretend
to
understand
unless
it
be
the
extreme
absurdity
of
both
a
gentleman
of
my
acquaintance
long
ago
he
was
a
man
when
i
was
a
small
boy
he
was
an
upright
and
a
good
man
he
has
gone
to
his
rest
and
sleeps
in
an
honored
grave
having
upon
the
simple
stone
above
him
no
lying
epitaph
had
an
old
negro
who
rejoiced
in
the
name
of
pompey
and
a
merino
buck
the
latter
a
valiant
animal
that
was
ready
to
fight
with
anybody
or
anything
that
crossed
his
path
between
him
and
the
person
was
an
distinction
an
active
and
irreconcilable
antagonism
that
developed
itself
on
every
possible
occasion
the
old
guinea
man
was
winnowing
wheat
one
day
with
an
fan
did
any
of
you
ever
see
one
of
these
primitive
machines
for
separating
wheat
from
the
chaff
used
by
our
fathers
before
the
fanning
mill
was
invented
it
was
an
ingenious
contrivance
by
which
a
man
with
a
strong
back
and
of
a
strong
constitution
could
clean
some
twenty
bushels
in
a
single
day
while
stooping
over
to
fill
his
fan
with
unwinnowed
grain
the
buck
taking
advantage
of
his
position
came
like
a
catapult
against
him
and
sent
him
like
a
ball
from
a
paixhan
gun
head
foremost
into
the
chaff
great
was
the
astonishment
but
greater
the
wrath
of
pompey
and
dire
the
vengeance
that
he
denounced
against
his
assailant
gathering
himself
up
and
rubbing
the
part
battered
by
the
attack
of
his
enemy
he
retreated
around
the
corner
of
the
barn
and
procuring
a
rock
weighing
some
twenty
pounds
returned
to
the
presence
of
his
foe
who
was
quietly
eating
the
wheat
that
the
negro
had
been
cleaning
evidently
regarding
it
as
the
legitimate
spoils
of
victory
getting
down
on
all
fours
and
managing
to
hold
the
stone
against
his
head
pompey
challenged
his
enemy
to
combat
the
buck
nothing
loth
drew
back
to
a
proper
distance
and
shutting
both
eyes
came
like
a
battering
against
the
stone
on
the
other
side
of
which
was
the
negro
head
as
might
have
been
expected
the
challenger
went
one
way
and
the
challenged
the
other
by
the
recoil
both
knocked
into
insensibility
by
the
concussion
pompey
was
taken
up
for
dead
but
his
wool
and
the
thickness
of
his
scull
saved
him
he
gave
the
buck
a
wide
berth
after
that
he
regarded
him
always
with
a
sort
of
superstitious
awe
never
being
able
to
comprehend
how
he
butted
him
through
that
big
stone
explain
the
matter
to
him
ever
so
scientifically
demonstrate
it
on
the
clearest
principles
of
mechanical
philosophy
still
pompey
would
shake
his
head
and
as
he
walked
away
would
mutter
to
himself
debbil
helps
dat
ram
dere
no
use
in
dis

to
come

chapter
xiv
a
deer
trapped
the
result
of
a
combat
a
question
of
mental
philosophy
discussed
we
returned
the
next
day
to
our
camping
ground
on
the
lower
chain
of
ponds
we
found
our
pioneer
and
his
goods
all
safe
no
visitors
having
passed
that
way
in
our
absence
smith
knocked
over
a
deer
on
our
passage
down
i
have
said
that
just
above
our
camp
was
a
dam
it
was
made
in
this
wise
first
great
logs
were
laid
up
across
the
stream
in
the
same
fashion
as
the
side
of
a
log
house
to
the
height
of
about
twelve
feet
properly
secured
and
upon
these
other
and
smaller
logs
were
laid
side
by
side
transversely
and
sloping
up
the
stream
at
an
angle
of
degrees
like
one
side
of
the
roof
of
a
house
these
long
slender
logs
reached
out
over
and
beyond
those
that
were
laid
up
across
the
stream
the
lower
part
covered
with
brush
and
then
with
earth
so
as
to
make
a
tight
dam
the
upper
ends
even
when
the
dam
was
full
extending
several
feet
above
the
top
water
line
these
logs
or
perhaps
they
had
better
be
called
large
and
long
poles
for
when
compared
with
the
foundation
timbers
they
were
nothing
more
have
of
course
above
where
they
are
covered
with
brush
and
earth
interstices
or
crevices
between
them
on
our
return
and
as
we
came
in
sight
of
the
dam
i
being
in
the
forward
boat
saw
a
small
deer
laying
stretched
out
upon
these
poles
dead
hanging
as
it
were
by
one
foot
my
impression
was
that
it
had
been
shot
and
dragged
up
there
and
left
by
our
pioneer
for
the
present
we
found
however
upon
examination
that
the
deer
had
walked
up
on
the
dam
probably
to
take
a
look
at
what
was
below
and
on
the
other
side
when
his
foot
slipped
down
between
the
poles
and
he
was
caught
as
in
a
trap
his
leg
was
badly
broken
and
nearly
severed
by
his
efforts
to
get
loose
and
the
bark
of
the
poles
was
worn
away
within
reach
of
his
struggles
he
had
died
where
he
thus
got
hung
and
there
he
was
stone
dead
but
not
yet
cold
when
we
found
him
he
was
a
fine
fat
young
deer
and
died
by
one
of
the
thousand
accidents
to
which
the
wild
animals
of
the
forest
as
well
as
man
are
exposed
upon
relating
this
incident
to
an
old
hunter
i
was
told
by
him
that
he
once
while
out
in
the
woods
came
upon
the
skeletons
of
two
large
bucks
that
in
fighting
had
got
their
horns
so
interlocked
and
wedged
together
that
they
could
not
separate
them
and
thus
locked
in
the
death
grapple
they
had
starved
and
died
there
lay
their
bones
the
flesh
eaten
from
them
by
the
beasts
and
carrion
birds
and
bleached
by
the
sun
and
the
storms
the
two
skulls
with
the
horns
still
interlocked
and
the
narrator
told
me
he
had
them
yet
at
home
fast
together
as
he
found
them
as
one
of
the
curiosities
to
be
met
with
in
the
rackett
woods
i
been
thinking
said
spalding
in
his
quiet
way
as
we
sat
towards
evening
looking
out
over
the
pleasant
little
lake
watching
the
shadow
chasing
the
retiring
sunlight
up
the
sides
of
the
opposite
hills
i
been
thinking
how
differently
we
act
and
feel
and
talk
aye
and
think
too
out
here
in
these
old
woods
from
what
we
do
when
at
home
and
surrounded
by
civilization
however
we
four
may
deny
being
old
we
can
not
certainly
claim
to
be
young
we
have
all
reached
the
meridian
of
life
and
though
feeling
few
if
any
of
the
infirmities
of
age
still
our
next
move
will
be
in
the
downhill
direction
yet
notwithstanding
all
this
we
talk
and
act
and
think
and
feel
too
like
boys
i
do
not
speak
this
reproachfully
but
as
a
fact
which
develops
a
curious
attribute
of
the
human
mind
well
replied
the
doctor
while
it
may
be
curious
it
is
exceedingly
natural
we
have
thrown
off
the
restraints
which
society
imposes
upon
us
we
have
thrown
off
the
cares
which
the
business
of
life
heaps
upon
us
we
have
gone
back
for
a
season
to
the
freedom
the
sports
the
sights
the
exercises
which
delighted
our
boyhood
and
can
it
be
called
strange
that
the
feelings
the
thoughts
and
emotions
of
our
youth
should
come
welling
up
from
the
long
past
or
that
with
the
return
of
boyish
emotions
the
language
and
actions
of
boyhood
should
be
indulged
in
again
you
will
find
said
smith
your
old
feelings
of
sobriety
of
thoughtfulness
your
cautiousness
coming
back
just
in
proportion
as
you
tire
of
this
wilderness
life
and
that
by
the
time
you
are
ready
to
return
to
civilization
you
will
have
become
as
staid
sober
and
reflective
men
of
the
world
as
when
you
started
with
as
strict
a
guard
upon
your
expression
of
sentiment
or
opinion
as
ever
it
is
that
of
which
you
speak
remarked
spalding
over
the
emotions
the
sentiments
of
the
heart
stifling
their
expression
and
chaining
down
under
a
placid
exterior
their
manifestations
that
constitutes
one
of
the
broad
distinctions
between
youth
and
manhood
it
is
when
that
guard
is
set
that
the
process
of
fossilization
so
to
speak
begins
and
if
no
relaxing
agency
intervenes
the
heart
becomes
cold
and
hard
even
before
white
hairs
gather
upon
the
head
i
often
imagine
that
if
men
who
really
who
have
the
power
of
analyzation
of
weighing
causes
and
measuring
results
would
dismiss
that
rigid
espionage
over
themselves
would
stand
in
less
awe
of
the
world
in
less
dread
of
its
accusation
of
change
and
with
the
fearless
frankness
of
youth
declare
the
truth
and
stand
boldly
up
for
the
right
as
they
the
understand
it
to
be
without
reference
to
consistency
of
present
views
and
opinions
with
those
of
the
past
the
world
would
be
much
better
off
progress
would
have
vastly
fewer
obstacles
to
contend
against
but
it
is
not
every
man
even
of
those
who
who
in
politics
in
religion
in
science
in
anything
involving
a
possible
charge
of
inconsistency
of
the
desertion
of
a
party
a
sect
or
a
principle
dare
avow
a
change
of
conviction
or
opinion
however
such
change
may
exist
this
should
not
be
so
it
belittles
manhood
and
makes
slaves
and
cowards
of
men
it
is
a
proud
prerogative
this
ability
and
power
of
thinking
it
is
a
priceless
privilege
this
freedom
of
thought
and
opinion
and
he
is
a
craven
who
moves
on
with
the
heedless
and
thoughtless
crowd
conscious
of
error
himself
a
hypocrite
and
a
living
lie
through
fear
of
the
charge
of
the
accusation
of
change
your
opinions
of
says
carlyle
words
hard
as
rocks
and
your
opinions
of
in
words
just
as
hard
even
though
your
opinions
of
may
contradict
your
opinions
of
there
is
a
fund
of
true
wisdom
in
this
beautiful
maxim
if
men
would
appreciate
it
it
would
correct
a
vast
deal
of
error
in
politics
in
religion
in
philosophy
in
the
social
relations
of
life
times
change
and
struggle
against
it
as
they
may
men
convictions
will
change
with
the
times
the
man
who
says
that
his
opinions
never
alter
is
to
me
either
a
knave
or
a
fool
for
a
thinking
man
to
remain
stationary
when
everything
else
is
on
the
move
is
a
simple
impossibility
time
was
when
the
stage
coach
was
the
model
method
of
travelling
it
carried
us
six
sometimes
eight
miles
the
hour
in
comfort
and
safety
but
who
thinks
of
the
lumbering
stage
coach
now
with
its
snail
pace
of
eight
miles
the
hour
when
the
locomotive
with
its
long
train
of
cars
lighted
up
like
the
street
of
a
city
in
motion
rushes
over
the
smooth
rails
literally
with
the
speed
of
the
wind
the
scream
of
the
has
succeeded
the
old
and
the
iron
horse
taken
the
place
of
those
of
flesh
and
blood
change
is
written
in
great
glowing
letters
upon
everything
it
stands
out
in
blazing
capitals
everywhere
all
things
are
on
the
move
forward
and
forward
is
the
word
and
who
would
who
can
stand
still
amidst
the
universal
rush
only
a
century
ago
from
the
valley
through
which
the
majestic
hudson
rolls
its
everlasting
flood
westward
to
the
mighty
mississippi
westward
still
to
the
rocky
mountains
and
yet
westward
to
the
pacific
was
one
vast
wilderness
interminable
forests
standing
in
all
their
primeval
grandeur
and
gloom
boundless
prairies
covered
with
profitless
verdure
over
which
the
silence
of
the
everlasting
past
brooded
and
above
all
these
mountain
peaks
covered
with
perpetual
snows
upon
which
the
eye
of
a
white
man
had
never
looked
stood
piercing
the
sky
from
the
atlantic
coast
to
the
mississippi
that
old
forest
has
been
swept
away
the
broad
prairies
have
been
or
are
being
subjected
to
the
culture
of
human
industry
even
the
rocky
mountains
have
been
overleaped
and
beyond
them
is
a
great
state
already
admitted
into
the
family
of
the
union
and
a
territory
teeming
with
an
adventurous
and
hardy
population
knocking
at
its
door
for
admission
the
march
of
civilization
has
crossed
a
continent
of
more
than
three
thousand
miles
sweeping
away
forests
spreading
out
green
fields
planting
cities
and
towns
making
the
old
wilderness
to
blossom
as
the
rose
scattering
life

all
along
the
road
it
has
travelled
the
great
rivers
that
rolled
in
silence
through
unbroken
forests

become
the
highways
of
trade
upon
whose
bosoms
the
white
sails
of
commerce
are
spread
and
through
whose
waters
countless
steamboats
plough
their
way
these
stupendous

are
the
results
of

energy
and
they
reach
in
their

their
progressive
influence
through
every
vein

of

shaping

by
their

demonstrations
change

so
it

the
long

forward

forward
is
the
word
and
forward
will
be
the
word
for
centuries
to

why
because
all
men
here
in
this

republic
are
free
to

free

free

free

no

gyves
corroded
by

because
thinking
american
men
everywhere
live
in
the

ignoring

defying
the
dead

building
up
the

because

are
fearless
of

as
free

they

as
such
they
will
act
regardless

unchanged
immutable
fixed
as
a
star
always
amidst
the
new
demonstrations
looming
up
like
mountains
everywhere
around
us
man
life
is
short
at
best
a
little
point
of
time
scarcely
discernible
on
the
map
of
ages
his
aspirations
his
hopes
his
ambition
more
transient
than
the
lightning
flash
but
his
opinions
may
tell
for
good
upon
that
little
point
occupied
by
his
generation
and
he
should
them
in
words
hard
as
rocks
they
may
aid
in
illuminating
the
darkness
of
the
present
and
he
should
therefore
them
in
words
hard
as
rocks
they
may
have
some
influence
in
building
up
and
ennobling
human
destiny
in
the
future
and
he
should
therefore
them
in
words
hard
as
rocks
regardless
of
the
contumely
heaped
upon
him
by
little
minds
for
having
thus
spoken
them
what
if
the
ridicule
the
denunciations
of
the
unthinking
the
sensual
the
profligate
the
unreflecting
fools
of
the
world
be
poured
upon
him
what
of
that
may
be
one
of
darkness
and
storm
the
cloud
and
the
storm
will
pass
away
and
the
brightness
and
glory
of
the
sunlight
will
be
all
over
the
earth
let
him
his
opinions
then
of
in
words
hard
as
rocks
and
his
opinions
of
in
words
just
as
hard
let
him
speak
his
opinions
thus
on
all
subjects
within
the
range
of
human
investigation
upon
science
philosophy
politics
religion
morals
and
leave
to
little
minds
to
settle
the
question
of
consistency
or
change
let
his
be
the
flight
towards
the
sun
and
theirs
to
skim
in
darkness
along
the
ground
like
the
course
of
the
mousing
owl
after
it
became
dark
smith
and
martin
went
out
around
the
lake
night
hunting
and
the
rest
retired
to
our
tents
we
heard
the
report
of
smith
rifle
from
time
to
time
and
concluded
that
we
should
have
to
him
for
a
wanton
destruction
of
deer
contrary
to
the
law
we
had
established
for
our
government
on
that
subject
but
on
his
return
we
ascertained
that
though
having
had
several
shots
he
had
succeeded
in
killing
or
according
to
martin
account
even
wounding
but
one
and
that
a
yearling
and
the
poorest
and
leanest
we
had
seen
since
we
entered
the
woods
though
it
was
thus
diminutive
in
size
smith
declared
that
he
had
seen
and
shot
at
some
of
the
largest
deer
that
ever
roamed
the
forest
he
insisted
that
he
had
seen
some
by
the
side
of
which
the
largest
we
had
looked
upon
by
daylight
were
mere
fawns
and
thereupon
he
undertook
to
establish
a
theory
that
the
large
deer
fed
by
night
and
the
smaller
ones
by
day
this
would
have
been
all
well
enough
were
it
not
for
the
fact
understood
by
every
experienced
that
by
the
spectral
and
uncertain
light
of
the
lamp
or
torch
a
deer
when
seen
standing
in
the
water
or
on
the
reedy
banks
is
in
appearance
magnified
to
twice
its
actual
dimensions
to
this
smith
at
last
assented
since
to
deny
the
proposition
involved
the
conclusion
that
he
had
killed
the
wrong
deer
for
the
one
he
shot
at
as
it
stood
in
the
edge
of
the
water
though
much
smaller
than
some
he
had
seen
appeared
greatly
larger
than
the
one
he
killed
chapter

hooking
up
trout
the
left
branch
the
rapids
a
fight
with
a
buck
we
started
down
stream
in
the
morning
towards
the
forks
intending
to
ascend
the
left
branch
to
little
tupper
lake
we
reached
the
forks
at
three
directly
opposite
to
where
the
right
branch
enters
a
small
cold
stream
comes
in
among
a
cluster
of
alder
bushes
on
the
eastern
shore
at
the
mouth
of
this
little
stream
which
one
can
step
across
the
trout
congregate
we
could
see
them
laying
in
shoals
along
the
bottom
but
the
sun
shone
down
bright
and
warm
into
the
clear
water
and
not
a
trout
would
rise
to
the
fly
or
touch
a
bait
we
wanted
some
of
those
trout
and
as
they
refused
to
be
taken
in
a
scientific
way
and
according
to
art
it
was
a
necessity
for
which
we
were
not
responsible
which
impelled
us
to
a
method
of
capture
which
under
ordinary
circumstances
we
should
have
rejected
i
took
off
the
fly
from
my
line
and
fastened
upon
it
half
a
dozen
snells
with
bare
hooks
attached
a
small
sinker
and
dropped
quietly
among
them
a
large
fellow
worked
his
way
lazily
above
where
the
hooks
lay
on
the
bottom
eying
me
as
if
laughing
at
my
folly
in
attempting
to
deceive
him
with
fly
or
bait
i
jerked
suddenly
and
two
of
the
hooks
fastened
into
him
near
the
tail
that
trout
was
astonished
as
were
half
a
dozen
or
more
of
his
fellows
when
they
came
out
of
the
water
tail
foremost
struggling
with
all
their
might
against
so
vulgar
and
undignified
a
manner
of
leaving
their
native
element
we
got
as
beautiful
a
string
in
this
way
as
one
would
wish
to
see
albeit
they
laughed
at
our
best
skill
with
fly
and
bait
and
the
cream
of
the
matter
was
that
we
had
our
pick
of
the
shoal
we
pitched
our
tents
at
the
foot
of
the
second
rapids
on
a
high
bank
the
roar
of
the
water
sounded
deep
and
solemn
among
the
old
woods
as
it
went
roaring
and
tumbling
and
struggling
through
the
gorge
the
night
winds
moaned
and
sighed
among
the
trees
above
us
while
the
night
bird
notes
came
soothingly
from
the
wilderness
around
as
what
a
strange
diversity
of
tastes
exists
among
the
people
of
this
world
of
ours
said
the
doctor
addressing
himself
to
me
as
we
sat
in
front
of
our
tents
listening
to
the
roar
of
the
waters
you
and
i
i
take
it
enjoy
a
fortnight
or
so
among
these
lakes
and
old
forests
with
a
keener
relish
than
spalding
or
smith
here
i
judge
so
because
we
indulge
in
these
trips
every
year
while
this
is
their
first
adventure
of
the
kind
but
even
you
and
i
however
much
we
may
love
the
woods
however
we
may
enjoy
these
occasional
tramps
among
their
shady
solitudes
would
not
enjoy
them
as
a
residence
and
yet
i
have
sometimes
thought
i
should
love
to
spend
the
summers
in
a
forest
home
alone
with
nature
with
my
pen
and
books
a
and
rifle
to
supply
my
wants
and
a
friend
to
talk
with
occasionally
many
years
ago
i
was
out
on
the
western
prairies
some
sixty
days
beyond
the
region
of
bread
we
had
encamped
on
the
banks
of
a
stream
along
which
a
narrow
belt
of
timber
grew
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
has
passed
since
i
took
that
trip
to
look
upon
the
rocky
mountains
there
was
no
gold
region
laying
beyond
them
then
or
rather
the
enterprise
of
the
had
not
discovered
its
existence
and
the
greed
of
the
white
man
had
not
made
the
trail
over
the
mountains
or
through
their
dismal
passes
a
familiar
way
along
in
the
afternoon
we
were
visited
by
a
trapper
who
had
in
his
wanderings
discovered
the
smoke
of
our
camp
fires
he
was
a
iron
man
of
the
solitudes
of
nature
who
had
wandered
away
from
his
home
in
new
england
and
from
civilization
into
that
limitless
wilderness
he
was
glad
to
see
us
inquired
the
news
from
the
outer
world
talked
about
york
state
vermont
the
bay
state
and
then
after
an
hour
converse
as
if
his
social
instincts
and
sympathies
had
been
satisfied
he
shouldered
his
rifle
and
started
off
across
the
plain
towards
a
belt
of
timber
lying
dim
and
shadowy
like
a
low
cloud
upon
the
distant
horizon
i
watched
him
for
an
hour
or
more
as
he
trudged
away
over
the
rolling
prairie
growing
less
and
less
to
the
view
until
he
became
like
a
speck
in
the
distance
and
then
vanished
from
my
sight
there
was
a
solemn
sort
of
feeling
stole
over
me
as
this
lonely
hunter
wended
his
way
into
the
deep
solitudes
of
the
prairies
to
be
alone
with
nature
communing
only
with
himself
and
the
things
scattered
around
him
by
the
great
creator
he
seemed
to
be
contented
and
happy
how
different
were
his
tastes
from
yours
or
mine
my
friends
and
yet
i
felt
as
though
it
would
have
been
easy
for
me
to
have
been
like
him
an
isolated
and
solitary
man
had
circumstances
in
early
life
thrown
me
into
a
position
to
have
followed
the
original
bent
of
my
nature
and
yet
said
spalding
if
you
will
look
into
the
philosophy
of
the
matter
you
will
see
that
this
diversity
of
tastes
as
you
call
it
is
not
so
great
after
all
that
is
that
the
origin
of
the
impulse
which
sends
some
men
away
from
society
among
the
solitudes
of
the
wilderness
and
of
that
which
holds
others
in
constant
communion
with
the
busy
scenes
of
life
is
very
nearly
the
same
it
is
the
love
of
adventure
of
excitement
a
restlessness
for
something
new
a
desire
for
change
this
impulse
is
controlled
shaped
by
circumstances
of
early
life
by
education
and
association
but
the
foundation
of
it
at
last
is
the
thirst
for
excitement
the
love
of
adventure
one
man
wanders
away
into
the
wilderness
in
pursuit
of
it
another
plunges
into
society
in
pursuit
of
the
same
thing
these
hardy
men
who
are
here
with
us
who
were
reared
on
the
borders
of
civilization
enjoy
the
solitudes
of
their
wilderness
quite
as
much
and
upon
the
same
general
theory
as
we
do
the
society
to
which
we
have
been
accustomed
and
they
plunge
alone
into
the
one
with
quite
as
much
zest
as
we
do
into
the
other
in
the
pursuit
of
excitement
here
is
cullen
now
who
has
spent
more
time
alone
in
the
wilderness
than
almost
any
other
man
outside
of
the
trappers
and
hunters
of
the
prairies
of
the
west
i
appeal
to
him
if
it
is
not
rather
a
love
of
adventure
than
of
nature
which
sends
him
on
his
solitary
rambles
in
the
forests
may
be
the
judge
is
right
replied
cullen
as
he
rubbed
the
shavings
of
plug
tobacco
in
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
with
the
ball
of
his
right
while
he
held
his
short
black
pipe
between
his
teeth
preparatory
to
filling
it
may
be
the
judge
is
right
i
rather
think
he
is
and
let
me
tell
you
i
met
with
some
queer
adventures
as
you
call
them
in
these
woods
too
some
that
i
would
have
gone
out
arter
if
i
known
what
they
were
to
been
afore
i
started
been
movin
back
from
what
you
call
civilization
for
five
and
twenty
year
because
i
did
like
to
live
where
people
were
too
thick
and
where
there
was
nothing
but
tame
life
around
me
i
a
kind
of
liking
for
the
deer
and
moose
and
have
any
ill
will
towards
now
and
then
a
wolf
or
a
painter
i
like
a
rifle
better
than
i
do
the
handles
of
a
plow
and
i
rayther
bring
down
a
than
to
raise
an
acre
of
corn
and
i
do
care
who
knows
it
there
a
place
in
the
world
for
just
such
a
man
as
i
am
yet
and
will
be
till
these
old
woods
are
gone
do
you
see
that
said
he
rolling
up
his
pantaloons
to
his
knees
revealing
a
deep
scar
on
both
sides
of
the
calf
of
his
leg
as
if
it
had
been
pierced
by
a
bullet
and
do
you
see
that
as
he
exhibited
another
deep
scar
above
his
knee
and
that
as
he
showed
another
on
his
arm
above
the
elbow
wal
i
reckon
i
had
a
time
of
it
with
the
old
buck
that
made
them
things
on
my
and
on
my
as
they
say
out
west
fifteen
years
ago
i
was
over
on
tupper
lake
shantyin
on
the
high
bank
above
the
rocks
just
at
the
outlet
fishin
and
huntin
and
layin
around
loose
in
a
promiscuous
way
all
alone
by
myself
havin
nobody
along
but
the
old
black
dog
that
you
appealing
to
hank
wood
who
nodded
assent
remember
that
dog
continued
cullen
was
human
in
his
day
and
if
anybody
has
another
like
him
and
wants
a
couple
of
months
lumberin
in
the
place
of
him
i
ready
for
a
trade
he
may
call
at
my
shanty
wal
crop
and
i
had
seen
about
all
there
was
to
be
looked
at
about
tupper
lake
and
havin
hearn
some
pretty
tall
stories
about
the
deer
and
moose
up
about
the
head
of
bog
river
from
an
ingen
who
hunted
that
section
i
mentioned
to
crop
one
mornin
that
we
take
a
trip
into
them
parts
said
he
or
leastwise
he
did
say
a
word
agin
it
and
by
the
wag
of
his
tail
i
understood
him
to
be
agreeable
mud
lake
as
you
discovered
aint
very
near
now
and
it
was
a
good
deal
farther
off
then
the
settlements
had
been
pushed
so
far
into
the
woods
then
as
now
but
we
put
out
crop
and
i
for
mud
lake
we
passed
the
eight
carryin
places
afore
night
and
reached
the
first
chain
of
ponds
while
the
sun
was
hangin
like
a
great
torch
in
the
i
seen
a
good
many
deer
in
my
day
but
the
way
they
stood
around
in
those
ponds
and
in
the
shallow
water
of
the
river
below
among
the
grass
and
pond
lilies
was
a
thing
to
make
a
man
open
his
eyes
i
saw
dozens
of
at
a
time
and
if
it
did
seem
like
a
sheep
paster
i
say
it
i
had
my
pick
out
of
the
lot
and
knocked
over
a
for
provision
for
me
and
crop
i
aint
at
all
poetical
but
if
there
was
ever
a
matter
to
make
a
man
feel
like
stringin
rhymes
that
evenin
that
crop
and
i
spent
on
the
lower
chain
of
ponds
or
little
lakes
on
bog
river
was
a
thing
of
that
sort
the
sun
threw
his
bright
red
light
on
the
tops
of
the
mountains
away
off
to
the
east
spreading
it
all
over
the
lofty
peaks
like
a
golden
shawl
while
the
gorges
and
deep
valleys
around
their
base
rested
in
deep
and
solemn
shadow
the
loon
spoke
out
clear
like
a
bugle
on
the
lakes
and
his
voice
went
echoin
around
among
the
hills
the
frogs
were
out
and
out
jolly
while
the
old
woods
were
full
of
happy
voices
and
merry
songs
as
if
all
nater
was
runnin
over
with
gladness
and
joy
even
the
night
breeze
as
it
sighed
and
moaned
among
the
seemed
to
be
whisperin
to
itself
of
the
joy
and
brightness
and
glory
of
such
an
evenin
as
the
night
gathered
the
moon
in
her
largest
growth
came
up
over
the
hills
and
walked
like
a
queen
up
into
the
sky
and
the
bright
stars
gathered
around
her
twinklin
and
flashin
and
dancin
as
if
in
the
brightness
of
her
presence
away
down
below
the
bottom
of
the
lake
were
other
mountains
and
lakes
another
moon
with
bright
stars
shinin
and
twinklin
around
her
other
broad
heavens
just
as
distinct
and
glorious
as
those
which
arched
above
us
do
laugh
judge
for
me
and
crop
saw
and
heard
all
that
i
been
describin
to
you
and
we
felt
it
too
may
be
quite
as
deeply
as
if
we
been
bred
in
colleges
and
stuffed
with
the
larnin
of
the
books
i
heard
the
cry
of
the
painter
the
howl
of
the
wolf
and
the
hoarse
bellow
of
the
moose
that
night
and
crop
crept
close
alongside
of
me
in
our
and
answered
these
forest
sounds
by
a
low
growl
as
if
sayin
to
himself
that
while
he
rayther
keep
oat
of
a
fight
yet
if
necessary
in
defence
of
his
master
he
was
ready
to
go
in
wal
we
started
on
up
stream
next
mornin
passed
the
second
chain
of
lakes
and
went
along
up
the
crooked
and
windin
course
of
the
stream
till
towards
night
we
came
in
sight
of
mud
lake
that
lake
is
anything
but
handsome
to
my
thinkin
you
saw
it
was
gloomy
and
solemn
enough
situated
as
it
is
away
up
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
higher
than
any
other
waters
i
know
of
in
these
parts
all
about
it
are
fir
and
tamarack
and
spruce
the
lichens
hanging
like
long
grey
hair
away
down
from
their
stinted
branches
while
all
around
low
bushes
grow
and
moss
sometimes
a
foot
thick
covers
the
ground
that
judge
is
the
place
for
black
flies
and
mosquitoes
in
june
the
black
flies
are
all
gone
before
this
time
in
the
summer
but
if
you
a
taken
this
trip
the
latter
part
of
june
you
have
admitted
that
i
tellin
no
lie
if
there
any
place
in
the
round
world
where
mosquitoes
have
longer
bills
or
the
black
flies
swarm
in
mightier
hosts
i
do
know
where
it
is
and
sha
go
there
if
i
happen
to
find
out
its
location
i
a
tolerably
thick
hide
but
if
they
did
bite
me
i
would
say
so
but
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
deer
feedin
on
the
and
grass
in
that
lake
i
they
were
like
sheep
in
a
pasture
and
out
some
fifty
rods
from
the
shore
was
a
great
moose
helpin
himself
to
the
eatables
that
grew
there
i
laid
my
jacket
down
for
crop
to
watch
and
waded
quietly
in
towards
where
the
moose
was
feedin
i
got
within
twelve
or
fifteen
rods
of
him
and
spoke
to
him
with
my
rifle
he
heard
it
you
may
guess
without
knowin
who
or
what
hurt
him
he
plunged
right
towards
me
for
the
shore
but
he
never
got
there
alive
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
scampering
of
the
deer
at
the
sound
of
my
rifle
maybe
there
was
much
splashin
of
the
water
and
whistlin
and
snortin
and
puttin
out
for
the
shore
among
the
next
mornin
i
got
up
just
as
the
sun
was
risin
and
a
little
way
down
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
i
saw
a
buck
wal
he
was
one
of
that
buck
was
the
horns
on
his
head
were
like
an
chair
and
if
they
had
a
dozen
prongs
on
you
may
skin
me
he
was
as
big
as
an
ox
but
a
that
could
match
him
could
brag
of
a
pretty
rapid
growth
i
crept
up
behind
a
little
clump
of
bushes
to
about
fifteen
rods
of
where
he
stood
on
the
sandy
beach
and
sighting
carefully
at
his
head
let
drive
my
gun
hung
fire
a
little
owin
to
the
but
that
buck
went
down
and
after
kickin
a
moment
laid
still
and
i
took
it
for
granted
he
was
dead
so
i
laid
down
my
rifle
and
went
up
to
where
he
was
and
with
my
huntin
knife
in
my
hand
took
hold
of
his
horn
to
raise
his
head
so
as
to
cut
his
throat
if
that
deer
was
dead
he
came
to
life
mighty
quick
for
i
had
no
sooner
touched
him
than
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
with
every
hair
straight
towards
his
head
came
like
a
mad
bull
at
me
in
up
he
overshot
me
and
as
he
made
his
drive
one
prong
went
through
the
calf
of
my
leg
i
plunged
my
knife
into
his
body
and
the
blood
spirted
all
over
me
but
it
was
no
use
he
smashed
down
upon
me
again
and
made
that
hole
in
my
leg
above
the
knee
i
handled
my
knife
in
a
hurry
and
made
more
than
one
hole
in
his
skin
while
he
stuck
a
prong
through
my
arm
i
hollered
for
crop
who
was
watching
the
shanty
as
his
duty
was
the
old
buck
and
i
had
it
rough
and
tumble
sometimes
one
and
sometimes
the
other
and
both
weak
from
loss
of
blood
may
be
we
did
kick
and
tussle
about
and
tear
up
the
sand
on
the
beach
of
the
lake
the
buck
was
game
to
the
backbone
and
had
no
notion
of
givin
in
and
i
had
to
fight
for
it
or
die
so
up
and
down
over
and
over
and
all
around
we
went
for
a
long
time
until
crop
made
up
his
mind
that
my
callin
so
earnestly
meant
something
and
round
the
point
he
came
when
he
saw
what
was
goin
on
you
ought
to
seen
how
went
in
he
did
stop
to
ask
any
questions
but
as
if
possessed
by
all
the
furies
of
creation
he
lit
upon
that
buck
and
the
fight
was
up
he
with
his
teeth
and
i
with
my
knife
settled
the
matter
in
less
than
a
minute
but
judge
let
me
tell
you
that
buck
was
dangerous
and
if
crop
had
been
around
may
be
ther
have
been
the
bones
of
man
and
beast
on
the
sandy
beach
of
mud
lake
i
bound
up
my
wounds
as
well
as
i
could
but
it
was
tough
work
backin
my
bark
canoe
over
the
places
on
bog
river
and
across
the
ingen
carryin
place
and
from
the
upper
saranac
to
bound
lake
with
them
holes
in
my
leg
and
arm
and
the
other
bruises
i
received
when
i
got
out
to
the
settlements
i
was
mighty
glad
to
lay
still
for
six
weeks
and
when
i
got
around
again
i
was
a
good
deal
leaner
than
i
am
now
my
gun
hangin
fire
made
my
bullet
go
wide
of
the
spot
i
aimed
at
it
had
grazed
his
skull
and
stunned
him
for
a
little
time
and
crazed
him
into
the
bargain
i
learned
more
fully
a
fact
that
i
an
idea
of
before
by
my
fight
with
that
deer
and
it
is
this
that
it
best
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
a
furious
buck
with
tall
sharp
horns
on
his
head
he
a
dangerous
animal
to
handle
that
one
of
the
adventures
that
i
went
out
into
the
wilderness
arter
and
found
without
lookin
for
it
and
i
found
a
good
many
others
that
put
me
and
crop
in
a
tight
place
more
than
once
i
backed
him
over
all
the
carryin
places
between
little
tupper
and
the
saranacs
once
when
he
was
too
lame
and
weak
to
walk
and
nussed
him
for
a
month
afterwards
but
that
an
adventer
i
tell
another
time
there
a
deal
of
excitement
as
the
judge
calls
it
outside
of
the
fences
if
people
will
take
the
pains
to
look
for
it
there
chapter
xvi
round
pond
the
pile
driver
a
theory
for
spiritualists
we
put
up
our
tents
the
next
evening
on
a
bold
bluff
near
the
outlet
of
round
pond
a
picturesque
and
pleasant
sheet
of
water
some
eight
or
ten
miles
in
circumference
it
lay
there
still
and
waveless
in
that
calm
summer
evening
as
glassy
and
smooth
as
if
no
breeze
had
ever
stirred
its
surface
all
around
it
were
old
forests
old
hills
and
rocks
and
away
off
in
the
distance
were
the
tall
peaks
of
the
adirondacks
standing
up
grim
solemn
and
shadowy
in
the
distance
these
peaks
are
seen
from
almost
every
direction
they
tower
so
far
above
the
surrounding
highlands
that
they
seem
always
to
be
peering
over
the
intervening
ranges
as
if
holding
an
everlasting
watch
over
the
broad
wilderness
beneath
them
this
lake
is
probably
more
than
a
thousand
feet
above
the
rackett
and
the
river
falls
that
distance
principally
at
the
two
rapids
around
which
our
boats
were
carried
the
rest
of
the
way
it
is
a
deep
sluggish
stream
so
that
the
descent
may
be
reckoned
within
less
than
three
miles
a
ledge
of
rocks
forms
the
lower
boundary
of
the
lake
through
which
the
water
at
some
remote
period
broke
its
way
and
it
goes
roaring
down
rapids
for
of
a
mile
then
moves
in
a
sluggish
current
across
a
plain
of
several
miles
in
extent
then
plunges
down
a
steep
descent
for
over
a
mile
and
a
half
to
subside
again
into
quiet
and
move
on
with
a
sluggish
current
to
plunge
down
the
ledges
again
into
lake
there
are
no
perpendicular
falls
of
more
than
twenty
feet
but
the
water
goes
plunging
and
boiling
and
foaming
down
shelving
rocks
and
eddying
and
whirling
around
immense
boulders
rushing
and
roaring
through
the
gorges
with
a
voice
like
thunder
these
falls
are
all
useless
here
and
probably
will
be
for
centuries
to
come
but
were
they
out
in
the
living
world
in
the
midst
of
civilization
with
a
fertile
and
populous
region
about
them
they
would
soon
be
harnessed
to
great
wheels
and
made
utilitarian
the
clank
of
machinery
would
soon
be
heard
above
the
roar
of
their
waters
they
would
do
an
immensity
of
labor
on
their
returnless
journey
to
the
ocean
but
here
they
are
utterly
valueless
wasting
their
mighty
power
upon
desolate
rocks
rushing
in
mad
and
impotent
fury
forever
through
a
region
of
barrenness
and
sterility
so
far
as
the
uses
of
civilization
are
concerned
a
region
where
the
manufacturer
or
the
agriculturist
will
never
tarry
until
the
world
shall
be
so
full
of
people
that
necessity
will
drive
them
to
the
mountains
to
build
up
the
waste
places
of
the
earth
opposite
and
across
the
bay
from
where
our
tents
were
pitched
i
noticed
that
a
small
stream
entered
the
lake
and
smith
and
myself
crossed
over
to
experiment
among
the
trout
i
knew
would
be
gathered
there
we
were
entirely
successful
for
we
took
one
at
almost
every
throw
i
have
more
than
once
stated
that
the
trout
of
these
lakes
and
rivers
in
the
warm
season
congregate
where
the
cold
streams
enter
and
if
the
sportsman
will
search
out
the
little
brooks
no
matter
how
small
and
cast
his
fly
across
where
their
waters
enter
the
lake
or
river
he
will
be
sure
to
find
trout
in
any
of
the
hot
summer
months
we
returned
to
camp
before
the
sun
went
behind
the
hills
with
our
fish
ready
for
the
pan
and
our
boatmen
provided
us
with
a
meal
of
jerked
venison
pork
and
trout
which
an
epicure
might
envy
and
to
which
a
hard
day
journey
and
an
appetite
sharpened
by
the
bracing
influence
of
the
pure
mountain
air
gave
a
peculiar
relish
it
was
a
pleasant
thing
to
see
the
moon
come
up
from
among
the
trees
that
formed
a
dark
outline
to
the
lake
away
off
to
the
east
and
travel
up
into
the
sky
to
see
how
faithfully
it
was
given
back
from
down
in
the
stirless
waters
and
how
the
stars
twinkled
and
glowed
around
it
in
the
depths
below
as
they
did
in
the
depths
above
there
was
the
moon
and
there
the
stars
all
bright
and
glorious
in
the
heavens
above
and
there
another
moon
and
other
stars
as
bright
and
glorious
down
in
the
vault
below
the
lake
floating
as
it
were
an
almost
viewless
mist
a
shadowy
and
transparent
veil
between
as
we
sat
in
the
greyness
of
twilight
in
front
of
our
tents
a
curious
sound
came
over
the
lake
from
the
opposite
shore
so
like
civilization
that
it
startled
us
for
a
moment
here
we
were
fifty
miles
from
a
house
away
in
the
forest
beyond
the
sound
of
anything
savoring
of
human
agency
and
yet
we
heard
distinctly
what
was
for
all
the
world
like
the
blows
of
an
axe
or
hammer
upon
a
stake
driving
it
into
the
earth
it
had
the
peculiar
ring
which
any
one
will
recognise
who
has
driven
a
stake
into
ground
covered
with
water
by
blows
given
by
the
side
instead
of
the
head
of
an
axe
these
blows
were
given
at
intervals
so
regular
that
we
all
suspended
smoking
certain
that
there
were
other
sportsmen
beside
ourselves
in
the
neighborhood
of
this
lake
who
in
the
world
is
that
asked
smith
of
martin
who
seemed
to
enjoy
our
astonishment
that
replied
martin
is
a
gentleman
known
in
these
parts
as
the
he
visits
all
these
lakes
in
the
summer
season
and
though
as
a
general
thing
he
travels
alone
yet
he
sometimes
has
half
a
dozen
friends
with
him
if
you
listen
a
moment
may
be
you
find
that
he
has
a
friend
in
the
neighborhood
now
who
will
drive
a
pile
in
another
place
sure
enough
in
a
moment
the
same
ringing
blows
came
from
a
reedy
spot
in
a
different
part
of
the
bay
the
bird
that
makes
that
noise
said
martin
is
about
the
homeliest
creature
in
these
woods
it
is
a
small
grey
heron
that
lights
down
among
the
grass
and
weeds
to
hunt
for
small
frogs
and
such
little
fish
as
swim
along
the
shore
when
he
drives
his
pile
he
stands
with
his
neck
and
long
bill
pointed
straight
up
and
pumping
the
air
into
his
throat
sends
it
oat
with
the
strange
sound
you
have
heard
it
is
the
resemblance
of
the
sound
to
that
made
by
driving
a
stake
into
ground
covered
with
water
that
gives
him
his
name
he
an
awkward
filthy
bird
but
he
helps
to
make
up
the
noises
one
hears
in
these
wild
regions
my
first
thought
was
said
smith
that
we
had
got
among
the
spirits
of
the
woods
and
that
they
were
their
indignation
at
our
presence
there
was
something
so
human
about
it
by
the
way
remarked
the
doctor
and
you
remind
me
of
the
subject
what
a
strange
delusion
is
this
spiritualism
to
the
of
which
you
refer
and
how
singular
it
is
that
men
of
strong
natural
sense
and
cultivated
minds
should
be
drawn
into
it
we
all
know
such
their
delusion
too
is
stronger
than
mere
speculative
belief
it
is
a
faith
which
to
them
appears
to
amount
to
absolute
knowledge
they
have
no
doubt
or
hesitancy
on
the
subject
their
convictions
are
perfect
such
that
were
they
as
strong
in
their
faith
as
christians
as
they
are
in
the
reality
of
spiritualism
they
would
be
able
to
move
mountains
i
have
noticed
this
intensity
of
their
faith
said
smith
and
while
i
utterly
reject
the
whole
theory
of
spiritualism
i
could
never
join
in
the
ridicule
of
its
earnest
devotees
there
is
something
that
commands
my
respect
in
this
strong
faith
when
honestly
entertained
however
stupendous
the
error
may
be
to
which
it
clings
there
is
something
to
my
mind
too
solemn
for
derision
in
the
idea
of
communing
with
the
spirits
of
the
departed
or
that
the
time
is
approaching
when
living
men
and
the
souls
of
the
physically
dead
are
to
meet
as
it
were
face
to
face
and
know
each
other
as
they
are
it
is
one
which
i
can
and
do
reject
but
can
not
ridicule
the
world
however
regards
it
differently
and
yet
with
all
the
contempt
and
derision
that
has
been
poured
upon
this
singular
delusion
its
devotees
have
multiplied
beyond
all
precedent
in
the
history
of
the
world
they
number
it
is
said
in
this
country
alone
millions
and
have
some
forty
or
more
newspapers
in
the
exclusive
advocacy
of
their
theory
the
wise
people
of
this
world
said
spalding
that
is
those
who
are
wise
in
their
day
and
generation
laugh
at
the
believers
in
this
modern
theory
of
spiritualism
they
pity
them
too
as
the
unhappy
devotees
of
a
faith
which
sober
reason
and
all
the
experience
of
the
past
prove
to
be
as
unsubstantial
as
the
moonbeams
that
dance
upon
the
waters
at
midnight
still
these
same
devotees
point
to
the
demonstrations
of
what
they
regard
as
living
facts
phenomena
palpable
to
the
senses
things
that
appeal
to
the
eye
the
ear
and
the
touch
and
say
that
these
are
higher
proofs
than
all
the
dogmas
of
philosophy
all
the
observation
and
experience
of
former
times
all
the
logic
of
the
past
and
here
is
the
issue
between
spiritualism
and
the
mass
of
mankind
who
deride
and
condemn
it
now
be
it
known
to
you
that
i
am
no
spiritualist
i
reject
not
all
the
evidences
of
the
phenomena
upon
which
it
is
based
but
i
utterly
deny
that
such
phenomena
are
the
works
of
disembodied
spirits
i
myself
have
seen
what
utterly
confounded
me
and
while
i
reject
all
idea
of
supernatural
agencies
all
interposition
of
departed
spirits
yet
i
have
become
thoroughly
satisfied
that
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
than
are
dreamed
of
in
our
philosophy
these
phenomena
of
which
the
spiritualists
speak
i
will
not
undertake
to
pronounce
all
lies
some
of
them
are
doubtless
impostures
the
work
of
knaves
who
speculate
upon
the
credulity
and
superstitions
which
are
attributes
of
the
human
mind
but
they
are
not
all
such
but
while
i
admit
their
reality
i
insist
that
such
as
are
so
are
the
results
of
natural
laws
which
will
one
day
be
discovered
and
which
will
turn
out
to
be
as
simple
as
the
spirit
which
presides
over
the
telegraph
or
that
which
constitutes
the
life
of
a
steam
engine
there
may
be
and
probably
is
a
great
undiscovered
principle
which
underlays
these
spiritual
manifestations
as
they
are
called
and
mind
is
after
it
looking
for
it
carefully
and
what
mind
has
once
started
in
pursuit
of
earnestly
it
seldom
fails
to
overtake
i
have
sometimes
amused
myself
by
endeavoring
to
furnish
a
theory
for
the
spiritualists
to
stand
upon
based
upon
the
demonstrations
of
the
past
the
evidences
brought
to
light
by
the
researches
of
science
which
at
all
events
should
have
about
it
truth
enough
to
give
color
and
respectability
even
to
an
error
as
stupendous
as
that
of
spiritualism
this
theory
i
have
predicated
upon
the
progress
of
the
material
world
aside
from
animal
life
showing
that
what
may
have
been
impossible
thousands
of
years
ago
may
be
possible
or
about
becoming
possible
now
that
we
are
about
entering
upon
a
new
era
in
the
advancement
of
all
things
towards
perfectability
and
that
the
advent
of
that
era
may
be
marked
by
an
established
communication
between
the
living
and
the
spirits
of
the
departed
science
demonstrates
that
the
material
world
presents
in
its
history
an
illustration
of
the
great
principle
and
theory
of
progress
it
is
quite
certain
that
our
planet
was
once
a
very
different
thing
from
what
it
is
now
it
differed
in
form
in
substance
in
compactness
in
everything
from
its
present
condition
we
do
not
that
it
was
once
wholly
aeriform
mere
gasses
in
combination
too
crude
to
admit
of
solidarity
but
reasoning
back
from
established
facts
the
conclusion
is
almost
irresistible
that
this
earth
now
so
and
solid
so
ponderous
so
ragged
with
mountain
ranges
and
cloud
piercing
peaks
was
once
but
vapor
floating
without
form
through
limitless
space
drifting
as
mere
nebulous
matter
among
the
older
creations
of
god
however
this
may
be
it
is
regarded
as
quite
certain
that
time
was
when
ft
was
entirely
void
of
solidity
void
of
dry
land
with
no
continent
island
or
solid
ground
with
no
living
thing
within
its
circumference
it
was
thus
passing
through
one
of
the
remote
eras
of
its
existence
it
was
then
young
just
emerging
as
it
were
from
nothingness
growing
into
form
assuming
shape
and
gathering
attributes
of
fitness
for
exterior
vitality
preparing
the
way
for
higher
existences
than
mere
inorganic
matter
how
long
this
era
existed
science
has
failed
to
demonstrate
but
it
passed
away
and
solid
land
marked
the
next
era
of
the
earth
progress
it
was
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
absolutely
fatal
to
animal
life
an
atmosphere
which
while
it
stimulated
vegetable
growth
no
living
thing
could
breathe
and
continue
to
live
hence
it
was
that
vegetation
gigantic
almost
beyond
conception
covered
its
surface
fern
which
is
now
a
pigmy
plant
nowhere
higher
than
a
few
feet
grew
tall
and
overshadowing
like
great
oaks
while
oaks
it
is
fair
to
presume
towered
thousands
of
feet
towards
the
sky
these
stupendous
forests
stood
alone
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
no
animals
wandered
through
their
fastnesses
no
birds
sported
amidst
their
mighty
branches
noxious
exhalations
came
steaming
up
from
their
tangled
recesses
and
their
gloomy
shadows
lay
a
mantle
of
darkness
over
dreary
and
lifeless
solitudes
the
storms
raged
and
the
winds
howled
the
sun
travelled
its
daily
rounds
with
its
light
dimmed
and
clouded
by
the
pestilential
vapors
it
exhaled
and
silence
so
far
as
the
sounds
of
animal
life
were
concerned
reigned
supreme
the
stillness
of
the
grave
the
quiet
of
utter
desolation
save
the
voice
of
the
wind
or
the
storm
was
unbroken
all
over
the
face
of
the
earth
onward
and
onward
rolled
this
mighty
orb
on
its
pathway
through
the
heavens
bearing
with
it
no
animal
existences
freighted
with
no
human
hopes
carrying
with
it
nothing
of
human
destiny
man
with
all
his
lofty
aspirations
his
mighty
schemes
his
glory
and
his
pride
was
a
thing
of
the
future
he
had
not
yet
emerged
from
the
eternity
of
the
past
to
grapple
with
the
present
or
encounter
the
retributions
of
the
eternity
which
is
to
come
this
was
the
era
of
gigantic
vegetable
growth
and
it
had
its
uses
for
it
was
preparing
the
way
for
higher
and
more
complicated
existences
as
the
gases
that
surrounded
the
earth
became
consolidated
into
vegetation
as
this
stupendous
growth
decomposed
the
noxious
atmosphere
drawing
from
it
its
grosser
particles
and
working
them
up
into
solid
matter
extracting
from
it
what
was
fatal
to
animal
life
this
earth
entered
upon
another
era
of
its
progress
animal
life
made
its
appearance
it
was
weak
and
feeble
at
first
but
a
step
removed
from
vegetable
matter
the
molusca
the
polypi
and
the
rudest
forms
of
fishes
were
beyond
question
the
first
of
living
things
science
demonstrates
that
the
water
brought
forth
the
first
creations
endowed
with
animal
vitality
how
long
this
era
continued
no
man
can
tell
then
came
the
amphibise
gigantic
animals
of
the
lizard
kind
the
sauruses
that
could
reach
with
their
long
necks
and
ponderous
jaws
across
a
street
and
pick
up
a
man
if
street
and
man
there
had
been
then
came
land
animals
monstrous
in
growth
by
the
side
of
which
the
elephant
dwindles
to
the
diminutive
stature
of
the
dormouse
in
all
these
advances
was
a
succession
of
steps
mounting
higher
and
higher
in
complication
of
structure
each
more
perfect
in
organism
than
its
predecessor
vegetation
itself
became
more
complicated
and
as
it
approached
perfection
lost
its
gigantic
growth
solidarity
compactness
in
all
things
became
the
order
of
nature
the
atmosphere
surrounding
the
earth
became
more
and
more
fitted
for
the
higher
and
more
complicated
animal
organizations
at
last
when
time
was
ripe
for
his
advent
when
the
earth
was
fitted
for
his
residence
and
the
air
for
his
breathing
man
the
last
and
most
perfect
in
his
structure
the
most
delicate
and
finished
in
his
organization
of
all
living
things
made
his
appearance
he
stepped
from
the
hand
of
god
the
only
thinking
reflecting
the
only
intellectual
responsible
being
in
all
the
world
he
stood
at
the
head
of
created
matter
with
all
things
on
the
earth
subject
to
his
will
and
corresponding
to
his
condition
his
attributes
his
necessities
and
his
instincts
thus
this
great
earth
itself
has
been
but
one
continued
illustration
of
the
great
theory
and
principle
of
progress
from
a
beginning
lost
in
the
thick
darkness
of
a
past
eternity
it
has
been
marching
forward
in
a
career
as
as
the
sun
in
his
journeyings
through
the
sky
as
clearly
demonstrable
as
the
growth
of
the
germ
that
starts
from
the
buried
acorn
and
moves
on
to
its
full
development
in
the
great
oak
science
records
with
unerring
certainty
the
progress
of
the
earth
and
of
animal
life
from
the
lowest
existences
in
the
mollusca
and
polypi
up
to
the
superlatively
complicated
and
delicate
structure
of
man
tracing
it
step
by
step
until
it
is
finished
in
the
noblest
work
of
god
a
human
body
coupled
with
an
immortal
soul
and
here
arises
a
question
which
science
has
not
solved
and
to
which
the
philosophy
the
wisdom
the
logic
of
the
past
can
give
no
answer
the
earth
and
the
things
of
the
earth
have
been
moving
forward
marching
on
towards
perfectability
always
is
this
forward
movement
finished
we
have
in
looking
at
the
subject
in
the
light
of
science
a
time
when
there
was
not
on
the
earth
in
the
air
or
in
the
water
any
living
thing
we
have
an
era
when
animal
life
was
but
a
span
removed
from
vegetable
vitality
we
have
an
era
of
gigantic
vegetable
growth
an
era
of
gigantic
but
rude
animal
growth
and
so
on
step
by
step
down
to
the
advent
of
man
the
previous
combinations
of
animal
life
and
vegetable
life
passed
away
with
the
era
in
which
they
flourished
one
class
succeeding
another
each
emerging
from
and
stepping
over
the
annihilation
of
its
predecessor
till
we
come
down
to
the
present
is
there
no
future
progress
for
this
earth
as
a
planet
is
there
to
be
no
other
era
where
man
himself
like
the
sauruses
like
the
mastodon
shall
have
passed
away
to
be
succeeded
by
some
nobler
animal
structure
some
loftier
intelligence
some
more
cunning
invention
of
the
infinite
mind
man
great
in
intellect
powerful
in
mind
gifted
with
reason
and
having
within
him
a
spirit
that
is
immortal
proud
glorious
aspiring
as
he
is
falls
very
far
short
of
perfection
in
every
attribute
of
his
nature
to
say
therefore
that
the
prescience
the
creative
power
of
the
almighty
reached
the
limit
of
its
achievements
in
the
creation
of
man
is
to
impeach
the
omnipotence
of
god
himself
will
any
man
insist
that
the
ingenuity
of
the
almighty
is
exhausted
may
it
not
be
then
that
the
time
will
come
when
some
sentient
beings
as
far
superior
to
man
as
man
is
to
the
animals
of
the
era
of
the
lizards
and
the
amphibia
shall
like
the
geologists
of
the
present
day
be
delving
among
the
rocks
and
rubbish
of
vanished
ages
for
evidences
of
the
existences
of
our
own
proud
species
at
to
them
some
remote
period
of
the
world
progress
if
these
questions
can
not
be
answered
by
the
learned
and
the
wise
if
science
makes
no
response
and
philosophy
furnishes
no
solution
of
them
who
dare
say
that
the
world
is
not
even
now
entering
upon
a
new
era
of
progress
taking
another
step
in
the
forward
movement
may
it
not
be
that
the
time
is
coming
when
the
barrier
between
the
living
and
the
disembodied
spirit
is
to
be
broken
down
when
that
viewless
essence
that
mystery
of
mysteries
the
spirit
of
life
the
immortal
soul
shall
be
permitted
to
come
back
from
the
unknown
country
to
impart
to
the
people
of
this
world
the
wisdom
the
mysteries
and
the
glory
of
the
next
may
not
this
be
the
new
era
that
is
about
opening
in
the
progress
of
all
things
it
may
be
asked
is
it
not
possible
that
a
new
principle
is
about
being
evolved
that
will
admit
of
communication
between
the
living
and
the
physically
dead
may
it
not
be
that
the
world
and
its
surroundings
have
become
so
changed
that
what
was
impossible
thousands
or
even
hundreds
of
years
ago
may
have
become
or
be
about
to
become
possible
now
that
the
same
process
which
carried
this
earth
forward
from
the
beginning
that
so
changed
the
atmosphere
of
old
rendered
it
fit
to
sustain
animal
life
in
its
rudest
structure
that
so
changed
it
again
as
to
make
it
capable
of
sustaining
a
higher
order
of
animal
organism
that
kept
on
changing
and
improving
the
whole
face
of
the
earth
that
so
arranged
organic
matter
as
to
make
this
world
at
last
a
fit
residence
for
man
may
be
going
on
still
approaching
all
things
nearer
and
nearer
to
perfection
until
we
have
arrived
upon
the
threshold
of
an
era
when
living
men
may
commune
with
the
spirits
of
the
physically
dead
an
era
as
yet
but
in
its
dawn
when
the
stupendous
future
can
be
seen
only
as
through
a
glass
darkly
remember
i
do
not
assert
my
faith
in
a
theory
which
is
indicated
by
an
affirmative
answer
to
these
inquiries
for
i
have
none
i
give
the
record
of
the
earth
progress
in
the
past
as
it
is
written
upon
the
rocks
standing
out
upon

to

by

researches
and

by
the
energy
of
science
from
forgotten
and
buried
ages

to

the

we
spent
the

round

looking
into
its
secluded
bays
and
resting
when
the
sun
was
hot
beneath
the
shadows
of
the

old
trees
that
line
the

in
floating
along
the
shore
of
this
beautiful
sheet
of
water
one
can
hardly
help
imagining
that
in
the
broken
rocks
and
rough
stones
piled
up
along
the
margin
of
the
lake
he
sees
the
rains
of
an
ancient
wall
the
mortar
of
which
has
become
disintegrated
by
time
and
the
masonry
fallen
down
he
will
see
at
intervals
what
from
a
little
distance
seems
like
a
solid
wall
of
stone
laid
with
care
and
upon
which
the
lapse
of
centuries
has
wrought
no
change
so
regular
are
the
strata
of
which
it
is
composed
while
an
occasional
boulder
large
as
a
house
and
covered
with
moss
reminds
him
of
the
ruined
tower
of
some
stronghold
he
will
see
as
he
rounds
some
rocky
point
half
a
dozen
of
these
gigantic
boulders
piled
together
leaning
against
each
other
with
great
cavernous
openings
between
through
which
he
can
walk
erect
and
he
involuntarily
looks
around
him
for
the
armor
of
the
ancient
giants
who
piled
up
these
stupendous
rocks
and
walled
in
the
lake
with
these
massive
boulders
as
we
swept
around
a
point
near
the
south
shore
of
the
lake
we
saw
a
deer
at
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
us
feeding
upon
the
lily
pads
that
grew
along
the
shore
spalding
and
myself
were
in
advance
of
our
little
fleet
and
our
boatman
paddled
us
carefully
and
silently
towards
the
animal
using
the
paddle
only
when
its
head
was
down
he
would
feed
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
look
carefully
all
around
him
of
us
he
took
no
particular
notice
although
we
were
within
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
of
him
and
even
when
we
were
within
sixty
yards
he
seemed
to
regard
us
only
as
a
log
floating
upon
the
water
or
something
else
which
might
be
regarded
as
perfectly
harmless
spalding
was
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
when
within
some
eight
rods
of
the
game
we
lay
perfectly
quiet
for
a
moment
when
his
rifle
spoke
out
and
its
voice
rung
and
among
the
surrounding
hills
as
if
a
whole
platoon
of
musketry
were
blazing
all
around
us
the
deer
made
three
or
four
desperate
leaps
in
a
zigzag
direction
and
then
went
down
when
we
got
to
him
he
was
dead
he
was
a
fine
two
year
old
buck
with
spike
horns
and
in
excellent
condition
we
took
his
saddle
and
skin
and
passed
on
from
bound
pond
we
rowed
up
the
inlet
a
broad
and
sluggish
stream
full
of
grass
and
lily
pads
to
little
tapper
lake
we
saw
several
deer
feeding
along
the
shore
that
discovering
us
as
we
rowed
carelessly
along
went
whistling
and
snorting
away
into
the
forest
as
we
approached
the
lake
dark
clouds
gathered
in
the
west
great
ugly
looking
thunderheads
came
rolling
up
from
behind
the
hills
higher
and
higher
perfect
stillness
was
all
around
us
the
leaves
were
moveless
on
the
trees
and
the
voices
of
the
birds
were
hushed
squire
said
martin
to
me
i
thinkin
we
better
go
ashore
and
put
up
our
tents
there
a
mighty
big
storm
over
the
hill
and
be
down
this
way
before
many
minutes
and
we
rowed
to
a
high
point
at
a
small
distance
covered
with
spruce
and
fir
trees
and
put
up
our
tents
on
the

so
as
to
be
sheltered
from
the
wind
as
well
as
the
rain
this
was
the
work
of
only
ten
minutes
but
before
we
had
finished
the
deep
voice
of
the
thunder
came
rolling
over
the
forest
and
we
could
see
the
storm
rising
over
the
hills
in
a
long
black
line
all
across
the
western
sky
the
lightning
darted
down
towards
the
earth
or
across
from
cloud
to
cloud
and
the
thunder
boomed
and
rolled
along
the
heavens
its
deep
rumble
shaking
the
ground
like
an
earthquake
presently
the
hills
were
hidden
from
our
view
we
heard
the
rush
of
the
storm
in
the
forest
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
then
the
splash
of
the
big
drops
on
the
water
and
then
the
wind
and
the
rain
were
upon
us
for
a
few
minutes
i
thought
our
tents
would
have
been
lifted
bodily
from
the
ground
but
the
skill
of
our
pioneer
had
provided
against
the
blast
and
they
remained
standing
safely
over
us
in
a
short
time
the
wind
passed
on
leaving
the
heavy
rain
to
pour
down
in
torrents
and
the
deep
voiced
thunder
to
come
crashing
down
to
the
earth
or
go
rolling
solemnly
and
heavily
along
the
sky
it
rained
for
an
hour
as
it
can
do
only
among
these
mountain
regions
the
clouds
and
the
rain
at
length
swept
on
and
the
bow
of
promise
spanned
the
rear
of
the
retiring
storm
a
new
joy
seemed
to
take
possession
of
the
wild
things
and
gladness
and
merriment
sounded
from
every
direction
in
the
old
woods
a
thin
and
shadowy
mist
hung
like
a
veil
over
the
water
and
a
refreshing
coolness
as
well
as
brightness
and
glory
were
all
around
us
these
storms
of
a
hot
summer
day
in
this
high
region
if
one
is
prepared
for
them
are
full
of
pleasant
interest
they
rise
so
majestically
sweep
along
with
such
power
and
pass
away
so
triumphantly
leaving
behind
them
such
a
calm
sweetness
in
the
air
that
a
journey
to
this
wilderness
would
be
imperfect
in
interest
without
witnessing
them
we
entered
little
tripper
lake
towards
evening
at
the
north
end
and
looking
down
south
one
of
the
most
beautiful
views
imaginable
opened
upon
our
vision
surrounded
by
low
and
undulating
hills
dotted
with
islands
with
long
points
running
far
out
into
the
lake
and
pleasant
little
bays
hiding
around
behind
wooded
promontories
it
presented
a
wild
yet
pleasing
landscape
on
which
a
painter
eye
could
not
rest
but
with
delight
and
which
transferred
to
canvas
would
make
a
picture
of
which
any
artist
might
be
proud
by
the
way
i
wonder
that
our
artists
do
not
summer
among
these
mountains
and
lakes
sketching
and
painting
the
transcendently
beautiful
views
they
everywhere
present
there
is
nothing
like
them
on
all
this
continent
we
talk
about
the
scenery
of
lake
george
it
is
all
tame
and
spiritless
compared
with
what
may
be
seen
here
it
possesses
not
a
tithe
of
the
variety
the
bold
and
grand
the
placid
and
beautiful
all
mingled
and
changing
always
as
you
pass
from
point
to
point
along
these
lakes
why
do
not
the
artists
whose
business
it
is
to
make
the
canvas
speak
drift
out
this
way
and
deal
with
nature
in
all
her
ancient
loveliness
clothed
in
her
primeval
robes
and
smiling
in
her
freshness
and
beauty
as
when
thrown
from
the
hand
of
deity
it
would
repay
them
for
their
labor
and
yield
them
a
rich
harvest
of
gain
we
had
heard
of
the
shanty
in
which
we
were
to
encamp
and
we
rowed
straight
through
the
whole
length
of
the
lake
towards
it
we
reached
it
as
the
sun
was
going
down
and
stowed
away
our
luggage
before
the
darkness
had
gathered
over
the
forest
we
took
possession
by
the
right
of
squatter
sovereignty
the
owner
being
unknown
or
at
all
events
absent
from
the
woods
this
lake
is
one
of
the
few
in
all
this
region
that
i
had
never
visited
before
and
is
next
in
beauty
to
its
namesake
two
days
journey
nearer
to
civilization
it
is
about
twelve
miles
in
length
and
from
one
to
two
miles
in
width
with
many
beautiful
bays
stealing
around
behind
bold
rocky
promontories
and
sleeping
in
quiet
beauty
under
the
shadows
of
the
tall
forest
trees
that
tower
above
their
shores
it
is
dotted
too
with
beautiful
islands
some
rising
with
a
gentle
slope
from
the
water
covered
with
scattering
norway
pines
and
a
dense
undergrowth
of
low
bushes
others
are
covered
with
tall
spruce
fir
and
hemlocks
standing
up
in
stately
and
solemn
grandeur
their
arms
lovingly
intertwined
through
the
everlasting
verdure
of
which
the
sun
never
shines
and
others
still
are
gigantic
rocks
rising
up
out
of
the
deep
water
all
treeless
and
shrubless
remaining
always
in
brown
and
barren
desolation
on
which
the
eagle
and
osprey
devour
their
prey
and
the
flocks
of
gulls
that
frequent
the
lake
to
rest
from
their
almost
ceaseless
flight
civilization
has
not
as
yet
marred
in
anything
this
beautiful
sheet
of
water
even
the
lumberman
has
not
forced
his
way
to
the
majestic
old
pines
that
tower
in
stately
grandeur
above
the
forest
trees
of
a
lesser
growth
not
a
foot
of
laud
has
been
cleared
within
thirty
miles
of
it
the
old
woods
stand
around
it
just
as
god
placed
them
in
all
their
pristine
solemnity
stately
and
motionless
the
wild
things
that
roamed
among
them
in
the
day
of
old
are
there
still
and
the
same
species
of
birds
that
sported
in
their
branches
thousands
of
years
ago
are
there
still
we
heard
the
howl
of
the
wolf
at
night
we
heard
the
scream
of
the
panther
we
saw
the
tracks
of
the
moose
and
where
he
had
fed
on
the
pastures
along
the
shore
we
saw
the
footprints
of
a
huge
bear
in
the
sand
on
the
beach
and
the
were
like
those
that
lead
to
a
it
was
a
pleasant
thing
to
row
along
the
shore
into
the
bays
around
the
islands
and
into
the
creeks
that
came
in
from
other
little
lakes
deeper
in
the
wilderness
the
banks
are
mostly
bold
and
bluff
the
rocks
standing
up
four
or
eight
feet
from
the
water
or
broken
and
fallen
like
an
ancient
wall
here
and
there
is
a
long
stretch
of
beautiful
sandy
beach
on
which
the
tiny
waves
break
with
a
rippling
song
and
from
which
bars
go
out
with
a
gentle
slope
into
the
water
we
intended
to
remain
here
quietly
for
a
few
days
taking
things
easy
rowing
and
fishing
and
hunting
enough
for
exercise
only
there
is
plenty
of
deer
and
trout
and
duck
and
partridge
here
to
be
taken
with
small
labor
there
are
bears
and
wolves
and
panthers
in
the
woods
around
but
these
are
fewer
and
harder
to
be
come
at
than
the
other
game
there
is
an
occasional
moose
too
we
saw
the
tracks
of
all
these
animals
hereabouts
and
we
hoped
to
get
a
shot
at
some
or
all
of
them
before
leaving
the
woods
reader
did
you
ever
hear
the
wolves
howl
in
the
old
woods
of
a
still
night
no
then
you
have
not
heard
the
music
of
the
forest
some
old
forester
will
open
his
jaws
and
send
forth
a
volume
of
sound
so
deep
so
loud
so
changeful
so
undulating
and
variable
in
its
character
that
as
it
rolls
along
the
forest
and
comes
back
in
quavering
echoes
from
the
mountains
you
will
almost
swear
that
his
single
voice
is
an
agglomerate
of
a
thousand
all
mixed
and
mingled
and
rolled
up
into
one
may
be
away
in
the
distance
possibly
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
or
across
a
broad
valley
another
will
open
his
mouth
and
answer
with
a
howl
as
deep
and
wild
and
variable
as
the
first
and
possibly
a
third
and
fourth
one
on
the
right
and
another
on
the
left
will
join
in
the
chorus
until
the
whole
forest
seems
to
be
fall
of
howling
and
noise
and
yet
not
one
of
these
animals
may
be
within
a
mile
of
you
to
a
timid
man
there
is
something
terrific
in
the
howl
of
the
wolves
but
in
truth
they
are
harmless
as
the
deer
quite
as
wild
and
shy
and
full
as
cowardly
in
the
presence
of
a
man
they
will
fly
as
frightened
from
his
approach
unless
possibly
in
the
intense
cold
and
desolation
of
winter
when
driven
together
and
rendered
desperate
by
hunger
they
might
be
emboldened
by
starvation
to
attack
a
man
but
even
this
is
among
the
apocryphal
legends
of
the
wilderness
hearing
them
wolves
howlin
said
hank
martin
as
we
sat
in
the
evening
around
our
camp
fire
reminds
me
of
a
story
mark
shuff
tells
of
his
experience
with
the
critters
but
mind
i
do
pretend
to
swear
to
its
truth
for
i
do
claim
to
know
anything
about
the
facts
myself
i
tell
it
as
mark
told
it
to
me
and
if
it
turns
out
to
be
too
tough
a
yarn
to
take
down
whole
do
lay
it
to
me
you
know
mark
shuff
said
he
appealing
to
me
and
you
may
believe
such
parts
of
it
as
you
may
be
able
to
swallow
and
the
rest
may
be
divided
up
as
the
doctor
said
the
other
day
among
the
company
go
ahead
said
the
doctor
i
take
a
quarter
as
my
share
of
the
story
and
you
may
cut
it
off
of
either
end
or
carve
it
out
of
the
middle
i
take
a
quarter
tough
or
tender
you
may
set
down
a
quarter
to
my
account
said
smith
and
spalding
shall
take
another
very
well
then
said
martin
i
believe
a
quarter
of
it
myself
and
so
the
case
is
made
up
as
the
judge
would
say
well
repeated
martin
you
know
mare
shuff
of
course
i
know
mark
shuff
and
who
that
has
visited
these
lakes
and
woods
do
know
him
he
is
a
stalwart
man
six
feet
in
his
stockings
strong
healthy
and
enduring
as
iron
i
have
had
him
as
a
boatman
and
guide
about
lake
and
the
regions
beyond
it
more
than
once
he
works
at
lumbering
in
the
winter
and
if
there
is
one
among
the
hundreds
i
had
almost
said
thousands
who
make
war
in
the
snowy
season
of
the
year
upon
the
old
pines
of
the
rackett
woods
who
can
swing
an
axe
more
effectually
than
mark
shuff
his
light
is
under
a
bushel
his
fame
obscured
mark
works
hard
for
four
or
five
months
and
lays
around
loose
the
balance
of
the
year
in
the
summer
he
holds
a
cost
as
a
thing
of
ornament
rather
than
use
and
boots
or
shoes
as
luxuries
not
to
be
reckoned
as
among
the
necessaries
of
life
his
hat
as
a
general
thing
is
of
straw
and
minus
a
little
more
than
half
the
brim
he
would
be
out
of
place
and
out
of
uniform
as
well
as
out
of
temper
with
himself
if
he
was
for
any
considerable
length
of
time
without
the
stub
of
a
marvelously
black
pipe
in
his
mouth
filled
with
plug
tobacco
shaved
and
rubbed
in
his
hand
into
a
proper
condition
for
smoking
mark
though
by
no
means
an
intemperate
man
is
fond
of
a
drop
now
and
then
and
when
he
has
just
a
thimbleful
too
much
the
way
he
will
swear
is
emphatically
a
sin
and
yet
he
is
anything
but
quarrelsome
or
contrary
even
when
a
shade
over
the
line
of
strict
sobriety
he
is
a
great
strong
specimen
of
the
genus
homo
a
giant
in
physical
strength
and
were
i
a
wolf
i
would
prefer
letting
him
alone
to
any
man
in
these
parts
when
he
gets
just
the
least
grain
shiny
and
he
never
gets
beyond
that
and
his
oar
goes
a
little
wrong
or
a
twig
brushes
him
ungently
or
his
seat
gets
a
little
hard
he
will
express
his
sense
of
its
improper
deportment
by
incontinently
damning
its
eyes
and
so
forth
as
if
it
were
a
sentient
thing
and
understood
all
his
profane
denunciations
but
with
all
this
mark
never
forgets
to
be
respectful
and
in
his
way
courteous
to
his
employers
he
has
moreover
a
sharp
clear
eye
in
his
head
and
can
see
a
deer
or
any
other
game
as
quick
and
shoot
it
as
far
as
the
best
and
has
as
good
a
knowledge
of
where
they
are
to
be
found
as
any
man
in
these
woods
well
continued
martin
as
he
lighted
his
pipe
by
dipping
it
into
the
embers
and
scooping
up
a
small
coal
well
mark
shuff
and
a
friend
of
his
by
the
name
of
westcott
had
a
shanty
one
winter
over
on
tupper
lake
they
were
trappin
martin
and
mink
and
muskrat
and
wolves
when
they
could
get
one
they
shantied
on
the
outlet
just
at
the
foot
of
the
lake
below
the
high
rocky
bluff
round
which
the
little
bay
there
sweeps
there
was
any
house
then
nearer
than
harriets
town
down
by
the
lower
saranac
but
there
was
a
company
of
lumbermen
having
a
shanty
up
towards
the
head
of
the
lake
near
where
the
bog
river
enters
mark
one
cold
winter
morning
started
on
an
errand
to
the
lumber
shanty
i
speak
of
calculatin
to
return
the
same
evening
the
lake
was
frozen
over
and
he
took
to
the
ice
as
being
the
nearest
and
best
travelin
the
winter
had
set
in
airly
and
the
snow
had
lain
deep
for
months
and
the
game
of
the
woods
had
got
pretty
well
starved
out
mark
take
his
rifle
with
him
of
course
that
he
would
see
no
game
on
the
ice
worth
shootin
and
a
gun
would
only
be
an
incumbrance
to
him
well
he
did
his
errand
at
the
shanties
and
started
for
home
i
do
know
whether
he
took
a
drop
or
not
but
they
generally
keep
a
barrel
of
old
rye
in
the
lumber
shanties
and
my
opinion
is
that
mark
was
invited
to
take
a
horn
in
which
case
i
bold
to
say
the
horn
was
taken
however
that
may
be
mark
started
for
home
along
in
the
afternoon
and
took
to
the
ice
as
he
did
when
he
went
up
in
the
morning
everything
went
right
until
he
got
within
may
be
a
mile
of
home
when
he
heard
from
a
point
of
land
a
little
to
the
left
of
him
a
sharp
fierce
bark
and
turning
that
way
he
saw
a
great
shaggy
wolf
trot
out
from
behind
a
boulder
and
squat
himself
down
on
his
haunches
and
eye
him
as
if
calculating
the
probabilities
of
his
making
a
good
supper
while
mark
was
looking
at
him
feelin
a
little
oneasy
he
heard
another
sharp
bark
and
from
a
point
just
ahead
of
him
another
great
wolf
trotted
out
on
to
the
ice
and
sat
himself
down
eyeing
him
with
suspicious
intensity
in
a
moment
another
came
out
right
opposite
to
him
and
then
another
and
another
until
mark
swears
to
this
day
that
there
were
more
than
a
dozen
of
these
fierce
and
hungry
savages
squatted
on
their
haunches
within
fifty
yards
of
him
mark
as
i
said
had
no
rifle
his
only
weapons
being
a
hunting
knife
and
a
heavy
walking
stick
which
he
carried
in
his
hand
to
say
that
he
was
not
frightened
would
be
stating
what
i
do
believe
to
be
true
and
i
heard
him
tell
how
his
huntin
cap
seemed
to
be
lifted
right
up
on
his
head
as
if
every
hair
pointed
straight
towards
the
sky
he
looked
at
the
wolves
a
moment
and
then
walked
on
but
the
animals
trotted
along
with
him
still
however
keepin
at
a
respectful
distance
those
in
advance
seemed
inclined
to
cross
his
path
as
if
to
turn
him
towards
the
centre
of
the
lake
while
those
behind
went
further
and
further
from
the
shore
as
if
to
surround
him
and
thus
they
travelled
for
near
half
a
mile
mark
making
for
the
open
water
which
in
the
coldest
weather
is
always
to
be
found
near
the
outlet
of
the
lake
determined
if
they
came
to
close
quarters
to
take
to
that
and
swim
for
it
he
had
heard
and
knew
that
almost
every
animal
is
afraid
of
the
voice
of
a
man
so
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
as
he
said
ripped
out
some
select
and
choice
oaths
which
for
a
moment
alarmed
the
wolves
and
they
fell
back
a
few
rods
still
however
keepin
in
a
kind
of
half
circle
around
him
but
it
long
before
they
began
to
gather
in
on
him
again
and
though
his
shoutin
and
swearin
kept
them
at
a
good
distance
yet
they
seemed
to
be
gettin
used
to
it
and
it
did
alarm
them
as
it
did
at
first
mark
had
now
got
within
reach
of
the
water
and
he
felt
comparatively
safe
he
was
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
home
and
cold
as
it
was
he
felt
sure
that
he
could
swim
that
distance
before
being
compelled
to
take
to
the
water
it
occurred
to
him
to
halloo
for
westcott
which
he
did
with
all
his
might
the
wolves
appear
to
care
much
about
his
hallooing
but
kept
along
between
him
and
the
shore
and
before
and
behind
him
the
circle
closer
and
closer
every
ten
rods
and
mark
expected
every
moment
when
they
make
a
rush
on
him
in
which
case
he
made
up
his
mind
to
make
a
dive
into
the
water
along
which
he
was
now
travelin
presently
he
saw
westcott
with
his
rifle
along
the
shore
hid
from
the
kritters
by
a
high
rocky
point
within
some
twenty
rods
of
him
he
felt
all
right
then
for
he
knew
that
when
westcott
pinted
that
rifle
at
anything
something
had
to
come
it
was
a
dangerous
piece
that
rifle
was
when
loaded
and
westcott
was
at
one
end
of
it
mark
was
not
more
than
fifteen
rods
from
the
shore
but
that
ground
was
occupied
by
the
wolves
on
the
right
was
the
water
into
which
he
might
at
any
moment
be
compelled
to
plunge
while
both
before
and
behind
him
his
advance
and
retreat
was
alike
cut
off
he
had
noticed
that
whenever
he
stopped
the
wolves
stopped
as
if
the
time
for
the
rush
had
not
yet
come
and
it
puzzled
him
to
understand
why
they
delayed
the
onset
seeing
westcott
with
his
rifle
mark
determined
to
treat
his
assailants
to
a
choice
lot
of
profane
epithets
and
the
way
he
opened
on
the
cowardly
rascals
he
said
astonished
even
himself
but
while
he
was
thus
swearing
at
his
enemies
he
discovered
as
he
thought
the
reason
why
they
had
not
attacked
him
sooner
a
troop
of
a
dozen
or
more
wolves
broke
cover
some
distance
up
the
lake
and
came
runnin
down
towards
where
he
stood
for
whose
presence
no
doubt
those
around
him
were
waiting
just
then
he
saw
westcott
huntin
cap
above
the
rocks
on
the
point
and
saw
his
poked
out
in
the
direction
of
the
leader
of
the
pack
and
he
knew
that
that
old
time
had
come
mark
let
off
a
fresh
volley
of
profanity
and
as
the
wolves
seemed
preparing
for
a
rush
westcott
rifle
broke
the
frozen
stillness
of
the
woods
and
old
turned
a
summerset
and
went
down
the
astonished
wolves
clustered
together
for
a
moment
in
confusion
and
the
other
barrel
spoke
out
another
of
the
pack
bounded
into
the
air
and
as
he
came
down
kicked
and
thrashed
about
in
a
most
oncommon
way
and
then
laid
still
while
the
way
the
rest
put
out
for
the
point
some
distance
up
the
lake
was
a
thing
to
be
astonished
at
mark
threw
up
his
hat
and
hollered
and
shouted
and
swore
till
the
last
wolf
disappeared
into
the
forest
and
then
shoulderin
one
of
the
dead
kritters
and
westcott
the
other
started
on
home
the
hides
and
the
bounty
on
the
scalps
made
a
good
day
work
of
it
but
mark
swears
to
this
day
that
if
the
last
dozen
of
wolves
had
been
a
little
earlier
or
westcott
a
little
later
he
driven
like
a
buck
to
the
water
cold
as
it
was
and
if
they
been
a
little
earlier
still
he
have
been
a
goner
he
never
goes
far
from
home
since
without
a
rifle
although
with
that
he
has
no
fear
of
wolves
yet
he
concludes
that
a
and
a
stick
are
no
match
for
a
whole
pack
of
the
kritters
when
made
savage
by
the
starvation
of
winter

westcott
rifle
broke
the

of

and
old

turned
a
summerset
and
went
down
the
astonished
wolves

together
for
a

in

and

out
while
we
were
listening
to
the
story
of

and
the

the
old

over
the

made
the

ring
again
with
his
howling
he
was
answered
from
miles
away
down
the
lake
by
another
their
voices
kept
the

echoes
busy
until
we
laid
ourselves
away
in

glad
voices

chapter
xviii
an
exploring
voyage
in
an
alder
swamp
a
beaver
dam
a
fair
shot
and
a
miss
drowning
a
bear
an
unpleasant
passenger
we
started
the
next
morning
on
an
exploring
voyage
round
the
lake
to
look
into
the
bays
and
inlets
try
the
fish
and
deer
and
see
what
we
could
see
generally
we
struck
across
to
an
island
opposite
our
containing
five
or
six
acres
covered
with
a
dense
growth
of
spruce
hemlock
and
fir
with
an
occasional
pine
standing
with
its
tall
head
proudly
above
the
other
forest
trees
while
along
the
ground
the
low
whortleberry
bushes
loaded
with
fruit
now
just
ripening
grew
this
island
is
near
the
south
shore
and
separated
from
it
by
a
narrow
channel
some
twenty
rods
in
width
we
landed
and
were
regaling
ourselves
upon
the
berries
leaving
our
boats
and
guns
on
the
lake
side
of
the
island
we
had
wandered
near
the
centre
of
the
island
when
three
deer
started
up
within
two
rods
of
us
and
rushed
whistling
and
snorting
in
huge
astonishment
across
the
island
in
the
direction
of
the
mainland
and
dashing
wildly
into
the
water
swam
to
the
shore
and
disappeared
into
the
forest
we
in
truth
were
little
less
astonished
than
they
for
we
certainly
expected
no
such
game
to
be
hiding
there
and
when
they
leaped
up
so
suddenly
and
plunged
away
crashing
and
snorting
through
the
brush
it
startled
us
somewhat
but
our
boats
and
guns
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
and
we
could
only
look
on
as
they
swam
boldly
to
the
shore
without
the
power
to
harm
them
at
the
east
end
of
the
lake
a
large
stream
deep
sluggish
and
tortuous
enters
which
we
voted
came
from
a
lake
or
pond
back
at
the
base
of
the
hills
seen
some
three
or
four
miles
distant
in
that
direction
and
while
the
other
boats
passed
in
another
direction
spalding
and
myself
started
upstream
to
explore
it
as
we
advanced
the
alders
and
willows
encroached
more
and
more
upon
the
channel
until
it
became
too
narrow
for
rowing
our
boatman
took
his
paddle
and
seated
in
the
stern
of
our
little
craft
propelled
it
up
stream
for
an
hour
or
more
the
alders
gradually
contracted
the
channel
becoming
narrower
until
we
were
passing
under
a
low
archway
of
branches
covered
with
dense
foliage
through
which
the
sunlight
could
not
penetrate
the
arch
grew
lower
and
lower
and
the
channel
narrower
until
we
at
last
absolutely
stuck
fast
among
the
branches
of
the
alders
which
here
grew
almost
horizontally
over
the
stream
we
could
not
turn
round
and
to
go
further
was
absolutely
impossible
there
was
but
one
mode
of
extrication
and
that
was
to
back
straight
out
the
way
we
had
entered
our
boatman
changed
his
position
to
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
after
much
labor
and
exertion
we
started
down
stream
after
two
hours
of
hard
work
pushing
with
the
oars
and
pulling
by
the
branches
we
emerged
into
daylight
came
out
into
the
open
stream
not
a
little
fatigued
by
our
efforts
to
find
the
imaginary
pond
at
the
base
of
the
mountains
this
stream
with
the
broad
alder
marsh
that
stretches
away
on
either
side
was
doubtless
once
a
beaver
dam
and
we
thought
we
could
discover
where
these
singular
and
sagacious
animals
had
erected
the
structure
that
made
for
them
an
artificial
lake
our
theory
on
this
subject
may
have
been
true
or
false
but
this
much
is
a
fact
that
in
all
this
region
of
lakes
and
rivers
i
have
seen
no
alder
or
other
marsh
of
any
considerable
extent
save
this
in
the
times
of
old
when
the
indian
and
his
brother
the
beaver
lived
quietly
together
before
the
greed
of
the
white
man
had
built
up
a
war
of
extermination
between
them
this
must
have
been
a
glorious
country
for
the
beaver
the
lakes
are
so
numerous
and
the
ponds
and
rivers
so
fitted
for
them
that
they
must
have
had
a
good
time
of
it
here
for
centuries
the
indians
never
disturbed
them
never
made
war
upon
them
their
flesh
was
not
needed
or
fitted
for
food
and
the
value
of
their
fur
was
unknown
tradition
speaking
from
the
dim
and
shadowy
past
tells
us
of
the
vast
numbers
of
these
sagacious
and
harmless
animals
which
congregated
in
these
regions
living
in
undisturbed
quiet
and
happiness
all
the
year
building
their
dams
their
canals
and
cities
on
all
the
ponds
rivers
and
lakes
hereabouts
but
they
are
all
gone
now
i
inquired
if
any
had
been
seen
of
late
years
and
could
hear
of
but
a
single
family
which
some
ten
years
ago
were
said
to
dwell
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
mud
lake
the
highest
and
wildest
of
all
these
mountain
lakes
the
last
of
these
was
taken
four
or
five
years
ago
since
which
no
sign
of
the
beaver
has
been
discovered
they
are
doubtless
all
gone
and
as
this
was
their
last
they
may
be
regarded
as
extinct
on
this
side
of
the
alleghany
ranges
and
probably
on
this
side
of
the
eastern
slopes
of
the
rocky
mountains
like
the
beaver
the
indian
who
turned
against
him
will
soon
be
gone
too
annihilation
is
written
as
the
doom
of
both
the
wild
man
must
pass
away
with
the
woods
and
the
forests
before
the
onward
rush
of
civilization
and
history
will
soon
be
all
that
will
remain
of
the
indian
and
his
ancient
brother
the
beaver
well
be
it
so
and
who
will
regret
it
it
is
a
sad
thing
to
see
a
whole
race
perish
wiped
out
from
the
aggregate
of
human
existence
but
in
this
instance
its
place
will
be
filled
by
a
higher
and
nobler
race
and
the
of
the
savage
and
the
pagan
be
converted
into
cultivated
fields
where
stood
the
wigwam
will
stand
the
where
the
blazed
will
stand
the
halls
of
enlightened
and
christian
legislation
churches
and
and
all
the
accompaniments
of
christianity
and
civilization
will
take
the
place
of
ancient
forests
and
educated
intellectual
cultivated
minds
take
the
place
of
the
rude
untaught
and
unteachable
men
and
women
of
the
woods
as
we
the
lake
we
saw
a
noble
buck
feeding
along
the
shore
a
short
distance
from
us
we
dropped
behind
a
point
of
willows
from
the
outer
edge
of
which
we
would
be
in
shooting
distance
we
paddled
silently
round
the
point
and
there
within
fifteen
rods
of
us
he
stood
broad
side
to
us
presenting
as
beautiful
a
mark
as
a
man
could
wish
i
counted
him
certainly
ours
when
i
drew
upon
him
with
my
rifle
well
i
blazed
away
and
as
i
did
so
he
raised
his
head
suddenly
gazed
in
astonishment
at
us
for
a
moment
with
his
ears
thrown
forward
and
in
an
attitude
of
wildness
and
then
dashed
madly
away
into
the
forest
snorting
like
a
at
every
bound
i
had
not
touched
him
and
i
knew
it
the
moment
i
fired
our
little
boat
was
light
and
rollish
and
just
as
i
pressed
the
trigger
it
rolled
slightly
on
the
water
and
my
ball
passed
over
but
mighty
close
to
the
back
of
that
deer
i
was
mortified
enough
at
this
mishap
for
i
prided
myself
on
my
coolness
and
marksmanship
and
here
was
a
failure
apparently
more
inexcusable
than
any
that
had
occurred
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
deer
was
gone
and
spalding
and
the
boatman
indulged
in
a
hearty
laugh
at
my
expense
some
half
a
mile
up
the
lake
we
saw
a
great
turtle
sunning
himself
on
a
rock
which
was
partly
out
of
water
he
was
twice
as
large
as
any
of
the
kind
i
had
ever
seen
his
shell
was
all
of
two
feet
in
diameter
and
his
scaly
arms
as
they
hung
loosely
over
the
side
of
the
rock
were
as
large
as
the
wrists
of
a
man
he
was
some
six
or
eight
rods
from
us
and
spalding
gave
him
a
shot
with
his
rifle
the
ball
glanced
harmlessly
from
his
massive
shell
against
the
ledge
behind
him
and
starting
from
his
sleep
he
clambered
lazily
and
clumsily
into
the
water
we
threw
out
a
trolling
line
as
we
passed
up
the
lake
but
we
caught
no
trout
along
the
shore
however
we
caught
small
ones
in
plenty
with
the
fly
these
shore
trout
as
i
call
them
seem
to
be
a
distinct
species
differing
in
many
respects
from
the
other
trout
of
the
lakes
or
streams
they
are
uniform
in
size
rarely
exceeding
a
quarter
of
a
pound
in
weight
they
are
of
a
whitish
color
longer
in
proportion
than
the
lake
river
or
brook
trout
have
fewer
specks
upon
them
and
those
not
of
a
golden
hue
but
rather
like
freckles
they
are
found
among
the
broken
rocks
where
the
shores
are
bold
and
bluff
or
near
the
mouths
of
the
cold
brooks
that
come
down
from
the
hills
i
caught
them
at
every
trial
and
whenever
we
wanted
them
for
food
their
flesh
is
white
and
excellent
better
to
my
taste
than
that
of
any
other
fish
of
these
waters
we
rejoined
our
companions
in
a
little
bay
that
lay
quietly
around
a
rocky
promontory
where
we
found
them
enjoying
a
dinner
of
venison
and
trout
under
the
shade
of
some
huge
firtrees
by
the
side
of
a
beautiful
spring
that
came
bubbling
up
in
its
icy
coldness
from
beneath
the
tangled
roots
of
a
stinted
and
gnarled
birch
happily
there
was
enough
for
us
all
and
we
accepted
at
once
the
invitation
extended
to
us
to
dine
towards
evening
we
rowed
back
to
our
shanty
the
breeze
had
entirely
ceased
and
the
lake
lay
still
and
smooth
not
a
wave
agitated
its
surface
not
a
ripple
passed
across
its
stirless
bosom
the
woods
along
the
shore
and
the
mountains
in
the
back
ground
the
glowing
sunlight
upon
the
were
mirrored
back
from
its
quiet
depths
as
if
there
were
other
forests
and
other
mountains
and
hills
glowing
in
the
evening
sunshine
away
down
below
twins
to
those
above
and
around
us
we
saw
on
our
return
along
the
beach
the
track
of
a
bear
in
the
sand
that
had
been
made
during
the
day
and
we
had
some
talk
of
trying
the
scent
of
our
dogs
upon
it
but
it
was
too
near
night
to
allow
of
a
hope
of
securing
him
even
if
the
dogs
could
follow
and
we
gave
up
the
idea
promising
to
attend
to
bruin
case
another
day
as
we
sat
with
our
meerschaums
in
the
evening
speculating
upon
the
chances
of
securing
a
bear
or
a
moose
before
leaving
the
woods
a
wolf
lifted
up
his
voice
on
the
hill
opposite
as
and
made
the
old
forest
ring
again
with
his
howling
he
was
answered
as
in
the
night
previous
from
away
down
the
lake
and
by
another
from
the
hill
back
of
us
and
another
still
from
the
narrow
gorge
above
the
head
of
the
lake
however
discordant
the
music
appeared
to
us
they
seemed
to
enjoy
it
for
they
kept
it
up
at
intervals
during
all
the
early
part
of
the
night
seeing
that
bear
track
and
hearing
the
howl
of
those
wolves
said
the
doctor
reminds
me
of
a
story
i
heard
told
by
an
old
ohio
pilot
whom
i
found
in
drifting
down
that
noble
river
in
a
pirogue
some
five
and
twenty
years
ago
we
tied
up
one
night
by
the
side
of
another
similar
craft
that
had
gone
down
ahead
of
us
the
people
on
board
of
which
had
landed
and
built
a
and
erected
their
tent
they
were
strangers
to
us
but
in
those
days
everybody
you
met
in
the
wilderness
which
skirted
the
upper
ohio
was
your
friend
if
you
chose
to
regard
him
so
i
was
a
mere
boy
then
and
was
in
company
with
my
father
and
three
other
gentlemen
who
owned
a
township
of
land
not
far
from
cincinnati
that
is
not
far
now
considering
the
difference
in
the
mode
of
travelling
between
then
and
now
and
we
were
on
our
way
to
explore
that
township
i
did
not
regard
it
as
of
much
value
then
though
it
has
since
brought
a
heap
of
money
to
its
owners
we
found
the
company
belonging
to
the
other
boat
busily
employed
in
cooking
a
supper
of
venison
and
they
having
in
the
course
of
the
day
killed
two
deer
and
a
bear
that
they
found
swimming
the
river
we
were
invited
to
help
ourselves
an
invitation
which
being
cordially
given
we
as
cordially
accepted
we
had
been
passing
during
most
of
the
day
through
unbroken
forests
standing
up
in
stately
majesty
on
both
sides
of
the
river
and
stretching
back
the
lord
knows
how
far
after
the
darkness
gathered
the
wolves
made
the
wilderness
vocal
with
their
howling
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
heard
them
and
for
that
matter
the
last
until
since
we
have
been
in
these
woods
but
when
that
old
fellow
over
the
lake
lifted
up
his
voice
last
night
i
recognized
it
at
once
i
ca
say
i
admired
it
as
a
musical
performance
then
and
i
do
appreciate
its
harmony
now
if
there
are
those
who
like
it
why
gustibus
and
so
forth
but
i
set
out
to
tell
the
story
that
the
old
ohio
pilot
told
that
night
while
the
travellers
sat
smoking
around
their
and
the
wolves
were
howling
in
the
wilderness
about
us
i
do
not
of
course
vouch
for
its
truth
i
simply
tell
it
as
he
told
it
to
us
he
seemed
to
believe
it
himself
for
he
told
it
with
a
gravity
of
face
and
a
seriousness
of
manner
which
would
ill
comport
with
its
falsity
his
hearers
did
not
seem
to
regard
it
as
passing
belief
but
they
laughed
at
the
idea
of
drowning
a
bear
odd
years
ago
said
the
old
pilot
as
he
lighted
his
pipe
and
seated
himself
on
the
head
of
a
war
a
great
many
people
along
the
ohio
except
ingins
and
bears
and
we
like
to
cultivate
a
very
close
acquaintance
with
either
of
them
for
the
ingins
were
cheatin
deceivin
and
scalpin
critters
and
the
bears
had
an
onpleasant
way
with
that
people
of
delicate
narves
did
like
i
came
out
for
some
people
over
on
the
east
side
of
the
mountains
lookin
land
in
company
with
four
men
who
had
hunted
over
the
country
ohio
war
any
great
shakes
then
but
let
me
tell
you
stranger
it
had
a
mighty
big
pile
of
the
tallest
kind
of
land
around
waitin
to
be
opened
up
to
the
sunlight
it
goin
ahead
now
and
people
are
rushin
matters
in
the
way
of
settlin
of
it
but
you
could
stick
down
a
stake
most
anywhere
in
it
then
and
travel
in
any
direction
a
hundred
miles
climbin
a
fence
we
came
down
the
alleghany
in
two
canoes
and
shantied
on
the
ohio
just
below
where
the
alleghany
empties
itself
into
it
we
hid
our
canoes
and
struck
across
the
country
and
travelled
about
explorin
for
six
weeks
and
when
we
got
back
to
our
shantyin
ground
we
were
tuckered
out
you
may
believe
we
rested
here
a
couple
of
days
layin
around
loose
and
takin
our
comfort
in
a
way
of
our
own
early
one
morning
when
my
companions
were
asleep
i
got
up
and
paddled
across
the
river
after
a
deer
for
we
wanted
venison
for
breakfast
i
got
a
buck
and
was
returnin
when
what
should
i
see
but
a
bear
swimmin
the
ohio
and
i
put
out
in
chase
right
off
i
soon
overhauled
the
critter
and
picked
up
my
rifle
to
give
him
a
settler
when
i
found
that
in
paddlin
i
had
spattered
water
into
the
canoe
the
primin
and
makin
the
gun
of
no
more
use
than
a
stick
i
understand
much
about
the
natur
of
the
beast
then
and
thought
i
run
him
down
and
drown
him
or
knock
him
on
the
head
so
i
put
the
canoe
right
end
on
towards
him
thinkin
to
run
him
under
but
when
the
bow
touched
him
what
did
he
do
but
reach
his
great
paws
up
over
the
side
of
the
canoe
and
begin
to
climb
in
i
had
bargained
for
that
i
felt
mighty
onpleasant
you
may
swear
at
the
prospect
of
sich
a
passenger
i
had
time
to
get
at
him
with
the
rifle
till
he
came
tumblin
into
the
dugout
and
as
he
seated
himself
on
his
stern
showed
as
pretty
a
set
of
ivory
as
a
body
would
wish
to
see
there
we
sat
he
in
one
end
of
the
dugout
and
i
in
the
other
eyein
one
another
in
a
mighty
suspicious
sort
of
way
he
did
seem
inclined
to
come
near
my
end
of
the
dugout
and
i
was
principled
agin
towards
his
i
made
ready
to
take
to
the
water
on
short
notice
but
at
the
same
time
concluded
i
paddle
him
to
the
shore
if
he
allow
me
to
do
it
quietly
i
paddled
away
the
bear
every
now
and
then
grinnin
at
me
skinnin
his
face
till
every
tooth
in
his
head
stood
right
out
and
grumblin
to
himself
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
say
wonder
if
that
chap
good
to
eat
i
did
offer
any
opinion
on
the
subject
i
did
say
a
word
to
him
treatin
him
all
the
time
like
a
gentleman
but
kept
pullin
for
the
shore
when
the
canoe
touched
the
ground
he
clambered
over
the
side
and
climbed
up
the
bank
and
givin
me
an
extra
grin
started
off
into
the
woods
i
pushed
the
dugout
back
suddenly
and
gave
him
as
i
felt
safe
again
a
double
that
seemed
to
astonish
him
for
he
quickened
his
pace
mightily
as
if
quite
as
glad
to
part
company
as
i
was
i
larned
one
thing
stranger
that
mornin
and
it
this
never
to
try

story
climbing
to
avoid
a

an
unexpected
meeting

that
story
said
spalding
reminds
of
a
bear
story
i
shall
do
as
the
doctor
did
tell
it
as
it
was
told
to
me
i
did
not
see
the
bear
but
i
know
the
man
who
was
the
hero
of
it
and
his
brother
told
the
story
in
his
presence
one
day
and
he
made
no
denial
he
at
least
is
estopped
from
disputing
it
and
we
lawyers
call
that
evidence
of
its
truth
it
occurred
a
long
time
ago
when
there
were
fewer
green
fields
in
oswego
county
and
especially
in
the
town
of
mexico
than
there
are
now
the
old
woods
stood
there
in
all
their
primeval
grandeur
the
waves
of
ontario
laved
a
wilderness
shore
and
their
dull
sound
as
they
came
rolling
in
upon
the
rocky
beach
died
away
in
the
solitudes
of
a
gloomy
and
almost
boundless
forest
here
and
there
a
let
in
the
sunlight
and
the
woodman
axe
broke
the
forest
stillness
as
he
battled
against
the
brave
old
trees
the
smoke
of
burning
fallows
was
occasionally
seen
wreathing
in
dense
columns
towards
the
sky
civilization
enterprise
energy
and
new
life
were
just
starting
on
that
career
of
progress
which
has
moved
onward
till
the
wilderness
under
the
influence
of
their
mighty
power
has
been
made
to
blossom
as
the
rose
those
were
pleasant
times
as
we
look
upon
them
now
just
fading
into
the
dim
and
shadowy
past
but
they
were
times
of
toil
and
privation
the
arms
of
the
men
of
those
times
were
nerved
by
the
hope
of
the
future
and
the
spirit
that
sustained
them
was
that
of
faith
in
the
fact
that
the
promise
of
reward
for
their
labor
was
sure
do
the
men
of
the
present
day
ever
think
what
a
gigantic
labor
that
was
of
clearing
away
those
old
forests
contemplate
a
wilderness
reaching
from
the
atlantic
to
the
mississippi
from
the
great
lakes
and
the
majestic
lawrence
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
every
acre
of
which
was
covered
with
tall
trees
which
had
to
be
cut
away
one
by
one
not
with
some
great
machine
which
mowed
them
down
in
broad
swaths
like
the
grass
of
a
meadow
but
by
a
single
arm
and
a
single
axe
talk
about
the
pyramids
the
chinese
wall
the
great
canals
of
the
earth
they
sink
into
utter
insignificance
when
compared
with
the
prodigious
labor
of
clearing
away
the
american
forests
and
spreading
out
green
fields
where
our
fathers
found
only
a
limitless
wilderness
of
woods
the
sons
of
these
men
who
performed
that
labor
in
my
judgment
have
a
better
patent
to
preferment
and
honors
than
those
who
come
from
other
lands
to
claim
their
inheritance
after
it
has
been
thus
perfected
by
such
toil
and
hardships
and
dangers
as
the
history
of
the
world
can
not
parallel
i
think
if
i
remember
rightly
said
the
you
set
out
to
tell
a
bear
story
you
are
now
indulging
in
a
sermon
on
progress
allow
me
to
call
your
attention
to
the
bear
i
appeal
to
the
court
said
spalding
addressing
smith
and
myself
against
this
interruption
the
counsel
will
proceed
said
smith
with
all
the
gravity
of
a
judge
we
hope
the
interruption
will
not
be
repeated
well
said
spalding
resuming
his
narrative
some
fifty
years
ago
two
enterprising
men
brothers
marched
into
the
woods
in
the
town
of
mexico
now
in
oswego
county
with
their
axes
on
their
shoulders
and
stout
hearts
beating
in
their
bosoms
they
located
a
mile
or
more
apart
and
began
a
warfare
such
as
civilization
wages
against
the
old
forest
trees
men
talk
about
courage
on
the
the
facing
of
danger
amid
the
conflict
of
armed
hosts
and
the
crash
of
battle
all
that
is
well
but
what
is
such
courage
stimulated
by
excitement
and
braced
by
the
ignominy
which
follows
the
laggard
in
such
a
strife
to
that
calm
enduring
moral
courage
of
him
who
encounters
the
toil
and
hardships
incident
to
the
settlement
of
a
new
country
and
battles
with
the
dangers
the
long
years
of
privation
which
lie
before
the
pioneer
who
goes
into
the
forest
to
carve
out
a
home
for
himself
and
his
children
how
much
more
noble
is
such
courage
how
infinitely
superior
is
such
a
warfare
one
which
mows
down
forest
trees
instead
of
men
which
creates
green
pastures
broad
meadows
and
fields
of
waving
grain
instead
of
smouldering
cities
and
desolated
homes
how
much
more
pleasant
is
the
sound
of
the
woodman
axe
than
that
of
the
booming
cannon
how
much
more
cheerful
the
smoke
that
goes
up
from
the
burning
fallow
than
that
which
hangs
in
darkness
over
the
desolation
of
the
battle
field
beneath
which
lie
the
dead
in
their
stillness
and
the
wounded
in
their
agony
but
i
am
losing
sight
of
the
bear
exactly
so
said
the
doctor
and
we
have
not
as
yet
had
the
pleasure
of
making
his
acquaintance
suppose
you
give
us
an
introduction
to
the
gentleman
these
interruptions
are
entirely
out
of
order
gravely
remarked
smith
they
must
not
be
repeated
the
counsel
will
proceed
well
resumed
spalding
bowing
deferentially
to
the
court
one
of
these
settlers
started
one
day
across
the
woods
to
visit
his
brother
there
were
few
roads
in
those
times
and
these
were
laid
out
without
much
reference
to
distance
they
went
winding
and
crooking
every
way
to
avoid
this
hill
or
that
creek
or
water
course
or
any
other
impediment
which
nature
may
have
thrown
in
the
way
and
a
blind
footpath
or
a
line
of
marked
trees
was
more
commonly
travelled
from
one
forest
house
to
another
the
forester
was
tramping
cheerfully
along
thinking
doubtless
of
the
good
time
coming
when
his
farm
would
be
shorn
of
all
its
old
woods
when
flocks
and
herds
would
be
grazing
in
luxurious
pastures
tall
grain
waving
in
fields
the
summer
grass
clothing
in
richness
meadows
reclaimed
by
his
labor
from
the
wilderness
and
he
should
be
at
ease
among
his
children
first
settlers
of
a
new
country
think
of
these
things
and
it
is
because
they
think
of
them
that
their
hearts
are
strong
and
buoyant
with
hope
they
live
in
the
future
enduring
the
darkness
and
privation
of
the
present
in
their
faith
in
the
brightness
of
the
years
to
come
thus
they
wait
in
patience
for
while
they
command
success
and
the
end
of
their
toil
is
an
old
age
of
competence
and
in
the
closing
years
of
life
quiet
and
repose
well
he
was
enjoying
these
pleasant
visions
when
he
saw
some
thirty
rods
ahead
of
him
a
huge
bear
with
her
cubs
his
way
as
the
saying
is
in
other
words
coming
directly
towards
him
he
was
no
hunter
and
had
with
him
no
weapon
he
had
heard
strange
stories
of
the
ferocity
of
the
bear
when
her
cubs
were
by
her
side
and
to
say
that
he
was
not
horribly
frightened
would
be
a
departure
from
the
strict
requirements
of
truth
he
had
heard
too
that
a
bear
could
not
climb
a
small
straight
tree
and
could
the
question
then
was
between
climbing
and
running
he
was
not
much
in
a
race
and
he
decided
to
climb
so
selecting
a
perpendicular
ash
sapling
he
started
with
might
and
main
towards
the
top
he
went
up
as
he
supposed
till
he
was
out
of
the
reach
of
the
bear
and
held
on
all
the
time
keeping
his
eye
on
the
animal
and
making
as
little
noise
as
possible
the
bear
doubtless
seeing
that
he
was
beyond
her
reach
passed
on
out
of
sight
and
after
he
remained
till
the
danger
was
over
he
concluded
to
come
down
he
was
astonished
to
find
that
his
efforts
to
descend
were
powerless
he
seemed
to
have
frozen
to
the
tree
upon
looking
around
to
his
utter
amazement
he
found
himself
sitting
on
the
ground
both
legs
and
arms
locked
fast
around
the
tree
he
had
not
climbed
an
inch
and
the
bear
had
not
been
aware
of
his
presence
in
the
woods
that
ash
sapling
was
safe
from
that
day
it
stood
then
in
the
old
forest
the
woodman
axe
spared
it
it
stands
now
in
the
open
field
a
majestic
tree
its
great
trunk
eight
feet
in
circumference
its
long
arms
covered
with
foliage
casting
a
broad
shadow
over
the
pasture
beneath
in
which
cattle
and
sheep
seek
for
coolness
and
ruminate
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
days
it
is
pointed
out
as
the
tree
which
the
man
who
was
frightened
by
a
bear
climb
and
is
referred
to
as
evidence
of
the
truth
of
my
story
as
the
dutchman
proved
the
authenticity
of
his
bible
the
pictures
and
that
said
i
puts
in
mind
of
a
bear
story
which
has
this
merit
over
both
of
yours
it
is
true
i
can
speak
of
it
as
a
thing
of
personal
knowledge
occurring
within
my
own
personal
experience
i
began
the
study
of
law
in
angelica
the
county
seat
of
alleghany
county
and
as
it
was
a
good
many
years
ago
it
is
fair
to
assume
that
i
was
a
good
many
years
younger
than
i
am
now
and
that
the
country
in
that
region
was
younger
too
everybody
knows
that
alleghany
county
is
or
used
to
be
a
great
place
for
whirlwinds
and
tornadoes
if
they
do
not
they
may
understand
and
be
assured
of
the
fact
now
a
few
years
less
than
twelve
ago
a
black
cloud
came
looming
up
in
the
northwest
and
started
on
its
career
towards
the
southeast
as
it
swept
along
it
sent
its
fierce
winds
crashing
and
howling
and
roaring
through
the
old
forests
uprooting
hurling
to
the
ground
and
scattering
everything
that
encountered
its
fury
houses
barns
haystacks
fences
trees
everything
were
prostrated
and
to
this
day
its
track
is
visible
in
the
swath
it
mowed
through
the
old
woods
from
sixty
to
a
hundred
rods
wide
plain
and
distinct
still
for
miles
and
miles
it
was
not
of
that
tornado
however
that
i
propose
to
speak
others
had
preceded
it
and
in
the
country
all
about
angelica
were
what
were
called
these
windfalls
were
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
old
tracks
of
these
whirlwinds
and
tornadoes
that
had
swept
down
the
forest
trees
fire
had
finished
what
the
whirlwind
begun
in
time
had
grown
up
among
the
charred
trunks
of
the
old
pines
and
other
trees
bearing
an
immensity
of
fruit
and
it
was
a
pleasant
resort
for
young
people
one
of
those
windfalls
when
the
blackberries
were
ripe
and
luscious
these
windfalls
were
great
places
too
for
rabbits
partridges
and
small
deer
and
it
was
no
great
thing
to
boast
of
to
kill
a
dozen
or
two
of
the
birds
of
an
afternoon
i
went
out
with
a
friend
one
day
to
one
of
these
windfalls
partly
after
blackberries
and
partly
for
partridges
we
were
both
boys
younger
than
fifteen
then
and
each
possessing
probably
quite
as
much
discretion
as
valor
we
had
separated
a
short
distance
from
each
other
he
to
gather
berries
and
i
with
a
small
in
pursuit
of
game
presently
i
saw
my
friend
crashing
through
the
brush
towards
me
and
also
towards
the
fields
without
his
basket
and
bare
headed
his
hair
standing
straight
up
putting
in
his
very
best
jumps
as
if
a
thousand
tigers
were
at
his
heels
without
heeding
for
a
moment
my
anxious
inquiries
as
to
what
was
the
matter
he
kept
right
on
leaping
the
logs
like
a
deer
looking
neither
to
the
right
hand
nor
the
left
but
with
his
coat
tail
sticking
out
on
a
dead
level
behind
making
a
straight
wake
for
home
fear
is
said
to
be
contagious
and
i
believe
in
the
doctrine
that
it
is
so
i
caught
it
bad
and
without
knowing
what
i
was
afraid
of
i
started
and
if
any
fourteen
year
old
boy
can
make
better
time
than
i
did
on
that
occasion
i
should
like
to
see
him
run
i
kept
possession
of
my
and
came
out
neck
and
neck
with
my
friend
we
scrambled
over
the
outer
fence
and
ran
some
dozen
rods
or
more
in
the
open
field
without
either
of
us
looking
back
then
however
we
made
the
astounding
discovery
that
there
was
nothing
after
us
and
we
both
paused
to
take
breath
and
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
to
ascertain
if
possible
what
had
occasioned
the
race
i
learned
that
my
friend
after
i
left
him
had
gone
into
the
windfall
and
was
standing
upon
the
long
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
picking
berries
when
he
saw
a
few
rods
from
him
towards
the
other
end
of
the
log
on
which
he
was
standing
a
great
black
hand
reach
up
and
bend
down
a
tall
that
was
loaded
with
berries
this
alarmed
him
somewhat
for
whoever
the
great
black
hand
belonged
to
was
concealed
by
the
thick
bushes
and
their
foliage
from
his
view
presently
two
great
black
hands
were
placed
upon
the
log
and
a
huge
black
bear
clambered
lazily
up
and
for
a
second
stood
in
utter
amazement
face
to
face
and
within
fifty
feet
of
my
friend
both
broke
at
the
same
instant
in
affright
my
friend
in
one
direction
and
the
bear
in
the
other
my
friend
for
the
fields
and
the
bear
for
the
deep
woods
and
each
as
anxious
as
fear
could
make
him
to
put
a
belt
of
country
between
them
my
friend
dropped
his
basket
as
he
leaped
from
the
log
it
was
no
time
to
stop
for
a
basket
a
limb
caught
his
hat
and
pulled
it
off
he
had
not
time
to
stop
for
his
hat
the
truth
is
he
was
in
a
hurry
and
something
more
than
a
hat
or
a
basket
was
required
to
stay
his
progress
towards
home
the
squire
story
said
cullen
as
he
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
and
commenced
shaving
a
fresh
supply
of
tobacco
with
his
and
depositing
it
in
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
the
squire
story
reminds
me
of
an
adventer
crop
and
i
met
with
over
towards
regis
lake
a
good
many
year
ago
and
i
state
the
circumstances
of
the
case
as
the
judge
would
say
it
was
an
adventer
that
do
happen
often
leastwise
not
in
the
same
way
it
made
me
understand
some
things
that
i
had
much
idea
of
before
let
me
tell
you
judge
if
you
do
want
a
fight
with
an
animal
that
got
long
claws
and
sharp
teeth
do
come
close
upon
him
onawares
or
may
be
there
be
trouble
give
him
time
to
think
and
ten
to
one
he
take
to
his
heels
most
animals
have
more
confidence
in
their
legs
than
they
have
in
their
teeth
and
claws
and
they
be
very
likely
to
use
if
you
give
time
to
consider
but
if
you
find
a
painter
or
a
bear
takin
a
nap
in
your
path
and
do
want
to
have
a
clinch
with
him
wake
him
up
before
you
get
right
onto
him
or
he
be
very
likely
to
think
he
cornered
and
them
animals
have
onpleasant
ways
with
when
they
in
that
fix
wal
as
i
was
sayin
crop
and
i
was
over
on
regis
lake
in
a
store
of
jerked
venison
and
trappin
martin
and
mink
and
muskrat
and
huntin
wolves
and
sich
other
wild
animals
as
came
in
our
way
the
scalp
of
a
wolf
was
good
for
fifteen
dollars
in
them
days
and
a
backload
of
furs
was
worth
a
heap
of
money
we
had
a
line
of
martin
traps
leadin
back
to
the
hills
and
over
into
a
valley
beyond
where
the
animal
was
plentier
than
they
were
on
our
side
in
passin
along
this
line
we
had
to
round
the
end
of
a
hill
that
terminated
in
a
sharp
point
of
rocks
in
a
deep
gully
at
its
foot
a
stream
went
surgin
over
rapids
the
bank
on
the
side
towards
the
hill
was
may
be
twenty
feet
high
and
a
right
up
and
down
ledge
above
this
ledge
and
between
it
and
the
rocky
point
was
a
narrow
path
only
three
or
four
feet
wide
that
turned
short
around
the
end
of
the
hill
on
the
left
hand
was
the
ledge
and
at
the
bottom
of
it
were
broken
rocks
and
on
the
right
was
a
bluff
point
of
rocks
that
made
up
the
end
of
the
hill
standin
straight
up
may
be
fifty
feet
around
this
point
the
path
turned
sharp
almost
as
your
elbow
i
was
passin
quietly
round
this
pint
lookin
down
into
the
gully
with
crop
at
my
heels
when
on
turnin
the
short
elbow
there
i
stood
face
to
face
and
within
ten
feet
of
a
mighty
big
bear
that
was
travellin
my
way
as
the
judge
said
i
had
no
idee
that
he
was
around
and
i
quite
sartain
he
did
expect
to
meet
a
human
in
such
a
place
of
course
we
were
naterally
astonished
at
seein
one
another
just
then
and
the
meetin
did
seem
to
be
altogether
agreeable
to
either
party
i
ai
easily
scared
when
i
time
to
prepare
for
a
scrimmage
yet
i
free
to
say
i
have
given
a
couple
of
to
been
on
the
other
side
of
the
gully
just
at
that
time
the
bear
seemed
to
expect
me
to
begin
the
fight
for
after
gruntin
out
in
a
very
oncivil
way
his
surprise
at
makin
my
acquaintance
he
reared
himself
up
on
eend
and
with
a
fierce
growl
showed
a
set
of
ivory
that
was
pleasant
to
look
at
i
should
have
been
willin
myself
to
backed
down
and
apologized
for
my
rudeness
in
crossin
his
path
for
i
was
carryin
my
rifle
carelessly
in
my
left
hand
and
our
meetin
was
so
sudden
that
i
scarcely
had
time
to
bring
it
to
bear
upon
the
kritter
i
rather
think
i
should
have
dodged
back
any
how
but
crop
seemed
to
think
his
master
was
in
danger
and
that
he
was
obligated
live
or
die
to
go
in
so
quick
as
a
flash
he
rushed
by
me
and
threw
himself
into
the
very
face
of
the
desperate
brute
crop
made
a
great
mistake
when
he
calculated
he
was
a
match
for
that
bear
for
with
one
cuff
the
animal
sent
him
eend
over
eend
down
the
bank
upon
the
broken
rocks
below
but
the
little
time
that
was
so
occupied
saved
me
a
deal
of
trouble
and
danger
for
it
lasted
just
long
enough
for
me
to
bring
my
rifle
into
position
which
i
did
about
the
quickest
you
may
bet
your
life
on
that
i
run
my
eye
along
the
barrel
sighted
him
between
the
eyes
and
pulled
the
bear
keeled
over
onto
his
back
with
a
jerk
gave
a
spiteful
kick
with
both
hind
feet
and
he
too
went
over
the
ledge
onto
the
sharp
rocks
below
i
looked
over
and
saw
crop
staggerin
to
his
feet
and
lookin
about
in
a
bewildered
way
as
if
not
quite
understandin
how
he
came
there
i
went
round
a
little
way
and
got
down
into
the
gully
where
the
animals
were
i
found
the
bear
stone
dead
and
crop
with
two
ribs
broken
and
his
shoulder
out
of
joint
whinin
and
moanin
piteously
with
pain
i
set
his
shoulder
as
well
as
i
could
and
after
takin
the
skin
off
the
bear
i
backed
him
two
miles
to
my
shanty
it
was
a
fortnight
before
he
the
house
but
he
learned
a
little
piece
of
wisdom
by
that
cuff
that
sent
him
down
the
bank
and
got
a
little
insight
into
the
nater
of
an
angry
bear
illustration
crop
made
a
great
mistake
when
he
calculated
he
was
a
match
for
that

about

you

on
that
chapter
xx
the
chase
on
the
island
the
chase
in
the
lake
the
bear
gambling
for
glory
anecdote
of
noah
and
the
gentleman
who
offered
to
officiate
as
pilot
on
board
the
ark
we
had
as
yet
had
no
use
for
our
dogs
since
we
left
the
saranac
they
had
travelled
quietly
with
us
as
we
moved
from
place
to
place
or
stayed
inactive
at
the
tents
while
we
remained
stationary
the
game
was
so
abundant
that
the
real
difficulty
was
to
restrain
ourselves
from
destroying
more
than
was
needful
for
our
use
we
had
indeed
failed
to
live
strictly
up
to
the
law
we
had
imposed
upon
ourselves
for
we
had
at
all
times
trout
and
venison
beyond
our
present
wants
excusing
ourselves
on
the
ground
that
an
excess
of
supply
was
always
preferable
to
a
scant
commissariat
more
than
one
deer
was
slaughtered
if
the
truth
must
be
told
for
no
better
reason
than
that
given
by
an
irishman
for
smashing
a
bald
head
he
chanced
to
see
at
a
window
it
presented
a
mark
too
tempting
to
be
resisted
the
lake
from
our
camping
ground
we
stationed
two
of
our
boats
between
the
island
and
the
shore
nearest
the
main
land
and
the
other
on
the
opposite
side
and
sent
cullen
upon
the
island
to
beat
for
game
it
was
scarcely
five
minutes
before
the
voices
of
the
dogs
broke
upon
the
stillness
of
the
morning
in
a
simultaneous
and
fierce
cry
as
if
they
had
started
the
game
suddenly
and
fresh
from
his
lair
away
they
went
in
full
cry
across
the
island
the
deer
sweeping
around
the
upper
end
and
returning
on
the
opposite
side
as
if
loth
to
take
to
the
water
but
true
to
their
instincts
the
hounds
followed
making
the
hills
and
the
old
woods
ring
again
with
the
music
of
their
voices
presently
a
noble
buck
broke
cover
directly
opposite
to
where
the
doctor
and
smith
boat
lay
as
our
object
was
rather
to
enjoy
the
music
of
the
chase
than
to
capture
the
deer
they
shouted
and
hallooed
as
he
entered
the
water
and
he
wheeled
back
and
went
tearing
in
huge
affright
through
the
woods
up
the
island
again
still
the
howling
was
upon
his
trail
and
as
he
approached
the
upper
end
he
again
took
to
the
water
to
be
frightened
back
by
martin
and
myself
and
with
renewed
energy
he
bounded
across
to
a
point
stretching
out
into
the
lake
on
the
opposite
side
here
spalding
and
wood
were
stationed
and
they
by
their
shouting
drove
him
back
again
to
the
thickets
by
this
time
the
poor
animal
began
to
appreciate
the
full
peril
of
his
position
for
turn
where
he
would
he
found
an
enemy
in
front
while
the
cry
of
his
pursuers
followed
him
like
his
destiny
thus
far
every
effort
to
escape
by
taking
to
the
water
had
failed
and
he
seemed
to
think
as
martin
expressed
it
that
day
was
breaking
he
essayed
it
again
on
the
land
side
and
was
driven
back
by
us
and
thus
he
coursed
three
times
round
the
island
until
in
desperation
he
plunged
into
the
broad
lake
and
struck
boldly
out
for
the
opposite
shore
three
quarters
of
a
mile
distant
spalding
shouted
to
us
and
when
we
rounded
the
headland
we
saw
that
he
and
wood
had
headed
and
were
driving
him
towards
a
small
island
of
less
than
half
an
acre
covered
only
with
low
bushes
half
a
mile
down
the
lake
we
did
not
propose
to
harm
him
but
we
intended
to
drive
him
upon
that
little
island
and
by
surrounding
it
keep
him
there
for
a
while
by
way
of
experimenting
upon
his
fears
or
rather
as
martin
said
to
see
what
he
would
do
as
he
approached
the
shore
he
bounded
upon
the
island
and
tossing
his
head
from
side
to
side
as
if
looking
for
a
place
of
concealment
or
escape
finding
none
he
dashed
across
to
the
opposite
side
and
plunged
into
the
lake
he
was
met
by
the
doctor
and
smith
and
turned
back
he
rushed
in
another
direction
across
the
island
to
be
headed
by
the
boat
in
which
i
was
seated
and
again
in
another
direction
to
be
headed
by
spalding
thus
met
and
driven
back
at
every
turn
he
at
last
stationed
himself
on
a
high
knoll
near
the
centre
of
the
island
apparently
expecting
that
the
last
struggle
for
life
was
to
be
made
there
we
rested
upon
our
oars
making
no
noise
and
watching
his
movements
the
bushes
were
low
coming
only
up
midside
to
the
animal
he
watched
us
latently
for
half
an
hour
tossing
his
head
up
and
down
looking
first
at
one
then
at
another
as
if
calculating
from
which
the
attack
upon
his
life
was
to
come
at
last
as
if
overcome
by
weariness
or
concluding
that
after
all
there
was
no
real
danger
he
laid
quietly
down
in
answer
to
his
confidence
in
the
harmlessness
of
our
intentions
we
rowed
away
back
to
the
island
where
we
started
him
we
had
not
reached
it
however
when
we
saw
him
enter
the
water
and
swim
to
the
main
land
and
glad
enough
he
seemed
to
be
when
he
had
regained
the
protection
of
his
native
forests
we
took
our
dogs
from
the
island
and
rowed
to
the
broad
channel
of
the
inlet
which
enters
the
lake
on
the
left
hand
side
as
you
look
to
the
south
there
are
two
of
these
inlets
which
enter
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
each
other
each
of
which
comes
down
from
little
lakes
or
ponds
deeper
in
the
wilderness
the
one
we
entered
flows
in
a
tortuous
course
through
a
natural
meadow
stretching
away
on
either
hand
forty
or
fifty
rods
to
a
dense
forest
of
spruce
maple
and
beech
above
which
gigantic
pines
stand
stately
and
tall
in
their
pride
three
miles
from
the
lake
the
hills
approach
each
other
and
the
little
river
comes
plunging
down
through
a
gorge
over
shelving
rocks
and
around
great
boulders
as
if
mad
with
the
obstructions
piled
up
in
its
way
as
we
approached
these
falls
smith
who
sat
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
motioned
to
the
boatman
to
lay
upon
his
oars
and
pointed
to
an
object
partly
concealed
by
some
low
bushes
forty
or
fifty
rods
in
advance
of
us
remaining
perfectly
still
a
moment
we
saw
a
bear
step
out
upon
a
boulder
look
up
and
down
the
stream
and
stretch
his
long
nose
out
over
the
water
as
if
looking
for
a
good
place
to
cross
the
rapids
after
scratching
his
ear
with
one
of
his
hind
feet
and
his
side
with
the
other
he
turned
and
walked
deliberately
from
our
sight
into
the
forest
by
this
time
the
boat
with
the
dogs
came
in
sight
and
we
beckoned
its
occupants
to
come
to
us
one
of
the
hounds
only
had
ever
seen
game
of
this
kind
but
cullen
declared
that
there
was
no
game
that
they
would
not
follow
when
once
fairly
laid
on
we
wanted
that
bear
it
was
the
only
one
we
had
seen
indeed
it
was
the
only
one
i
had
ever
seen
wild
in
the
forest
we
went
to
the
spot
where
we
last
saw
him
and
there
in
the
sand
by
the
side
of
the
boulder
was
his
great
track
almost
like
a
human
foot
cullen
called
the
attention
of
the
dogs
to
it
and
hallooed
them
on
they
took
the
scent
cheerfully
and
with
a
united
and
fierce
cry
they
dashed
away
in
pursuit
they
had
ran
but
a
short
distance
when
they
seemed
to
become
stationary
and
deep
quick
baying
succeeded
the
lengthened
and
ringing
sound
of
their
voices
treed
by
moses
cried
cullen
as
he
dashed
forward
the
rest
of
us
following
as
fast
as
we
could
not
too
fast
said
martin
not
too
fast
there
no
hurry
he
come
down
unless
our
noise
frightens
him
let
us
go
quietly
plenty
of
time
belcher
has
got
his
eye
on
him
and
will
stay
by
him
till
we
come
we
travelled
quietly
and
as
silently
as
we
could
for
near
half
a
mile
and
as
we
rounded
a
low
but
steep
point
of
a
hill
there
sat
bruin
some
twelve
rods
from
us
in
the
forks
of
a
great
birch
tree
forty
feet
from
the
ground
looking
down
in
calm
dignity
upon
the
dogs
that
were
baying
and
leaping
up
against
the
tree
beneath
him
did
anybody
ever
notice
what
a
meek
innocent
look
a
bear
has
when
in
repose
how
hypocritically
he
leers
upon
everything
about
him
as
if
butter
would
not
melt
in
his
mouth
well
such
was
the
look
of
that
bear
as
he
peered
out
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
of
the
great
limbs
between
which
he
was
sitting
secure
as
he
supposed
from
danger
but
he
was
never
more
mistaken
in
his
life
in
watching
the
dogs
he
had
failed
to
discover
us
we
agreed
that
three
should
fire
upon
him
at
once
reserving
the
fourth
charge
for
whatever
contingency
might
happen
smith
the
doctor
and
spalding
sighted
him
carefully
each
with
his
rifle
resting
against
the
side
of
a
tree
and
blazed
away
their
guns
sounding
almost
together
it
was
pitiful
the
scream
of
agony
that
bear
sent
up
it
was
almost
human
in
its
anguish
it
went
ringing
through
the
woods
dying
away
at
last
almost
in
a
human
groan
after
struggling
and
clasping
his
arms
for
a
moment
around
the
great
branch
of
the
tree
his
hold
relaxed
he
reeled
from
side
to
side
and
then
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
with
three
balls
within
an
inch
of
each
other
right
through
his
vitals
he
was
larger
than
a
medium
sized
animal
of
his
species
and
in
excellent
case
the
next
thing
in
order
was
to
transport
him
to
our
boats
this
was
done
by
tying
his
feet
together
then
running
a
long
pole
cut
for
the
purpose
between
them
and
lifting
each
end
upon
the
shoulder
of
a
boatman
he
was
strung
up
as
allen
expressed
it
clear
from
the
ground
they
stumbled
along
as
best
they
could
over
the
rough
ground
and
through
the
tangle
brush
towards
the
river
it
was
a
heavy
load
considering
the
unevenness
of
the
path
and
the
men
were
compelled
to
halt
every
few
rods
to
breathe
we
got
him
safely
to
the
landing
at
last
and
tumbling
him
into
the
bottom
of
one
of
the
boats
started
down
stream
towards
our
shanty
a
proud
trio
were
spalding
smith
and
the
doctor
that
afternoon
returning
with
their
game
across
the
lake
and
they
certainly
had
some
occasion
to
congratulate
themselves
for
this
was
the
first
wild
uncaged
bear
either
of
us
had
ever
seen
and
him
they
had
succeeded
in
capturing
we
dined
that
afternoon
on
a
roasted
sirloin
of
bear
stewed
jerked
venison
fried
trout
and
pork
i
can
not
say
that
i
altogether
relished
the
roast
though
some
of
our
company
took
to
it
hugely
the
truth
is
that
with
some
of
them
venison
and
trout
were
beginning
to
be
somewhat
stale
dishes
they
did
not
relish
fat
pork
and
a
change
therefore
to
roasted
bear
meat
was
peculiarly
acceptable
gentlemen
said
smith
to
the
doctor
and
spalding
as
we
sat
after
our
meal
enjoying
our
pipes
what
say
you
to
selling
out
your
interest
in
that
bear
if
you
open
for
a
bargain
i
make
you
a
proposition
why
the
doctor
replied
there
be
nothing
left
but
the
skin
and
that
will
be
of
no
special
value
except
as
a
trophy
not
exactly
resumed
smith
i
deal
frankly
with
you
gentlemen
there
be
a
good
many
stories
to
be
told
about
the
killing
of
that
bear
and
my
object
is
to
appropriate
the
glory
of
the
achievement
now
it
wont
be
a
matter
to
boast
of
to
say
that
we
three
fired
into
one
bear
and
that
none
of
the
largest
oh
as
to
that
said
the
doctor
i
intend
to
enlarge
upon
the
subject
exaggerating
the
size
of
the
bear
describing
the
terrible
conflict
i
had
with
him
how
i
happened
to
save
myself
by
remembering
my
pistol
how
i
made
the
three
ball
holes
in
him
while
you
and
spalding
were
running
away
and
how
he
bit
me
in
the
arm
and
almost
hugged
me
to
death
while
i
was
trying
to
get
at
the
pistol
i
shall
shine
in
that
bear
story
yes
yes
i
shall
shine
hear
the
cormorant
exclaimed
smith
hear
him
and
he
do
precisely
as
he
says
he
will
only
a
great
deal
worse
we
must
buy
him
out
spalding
we
must
purchase
his
silence
for
our
own
credit
well
gentlemen
replied
spalding
settle
it
between
you
you
are
welcome
to
my
share
of
the
achievement
the
scream
of
mortal
agony
which
that
bear
sent
up
when
our
three
balls
went
crashing
through
its
body
rings
in
my
ears
yet
i
do
feel
quite
so
proud
of
the
shot
as
i
otherwise
should
have
done
you
are
welcome
to
my
share
of
the
glory
spoken
like
a
liberal
and
gentleman
said
smith
well
doctor
name
the
amount
and
nature
of
the
blackmail
you
intend
to
levy
upon
me
but
have
a
conscience
man
have
a
conscience
it
will
be
making
a
great
sacrifice
on
my
part
the
doctor
replied
but
out
of
friendship
for
you
i
make
you
a
proposition
toss
op
a
dollar
and
the
one
that
wins
shall
have
the
honour
of
having
killed
the
bear
and
of
telling
the
story
in
his
own
way
and
the
others
shall
indorse
it
agreed
said
smith
but
if
you
win
i
shall
have
to
borrow
a
conscience
of
spalding
or
some
other
lawyer
for
there
be
need
of
a
pretty
elastic
one
yours
will
answer
i
think
drily
remarked
spalding
it
appears
to
me
gentlemen
said
i
that
i
something
to
say
about
the
killing
of
that
bear
you
exclaimed
the
doctor
what
had
you
to
do
with
it
pray
there
stands
your
rifle
with
the
same
ball
in
it
that
you
placed
there
this
morning
you
have
discharged
your
rifle
notwithstanding
that
i
replied
i
am
entitled
to
a
portion
of
the
glory
as
i
am
chargeable
with
my
share
of
the
responsibility
of
killing
the
bear
i
was
one
of
the
first
who
discovered
him
i
was
among
the
foremost
in
the
pursuit
i
was
present
aiding
and
advising
in
the
manner
of
the
killing
i
had
my
weapon
in
my
hand
and
was
restrained
from
using
it
only
because
you
might
fail
to
accomplish
what
my
reserved
bullet
would
have
made
secure
now
if
this
bear
had
been
human
and
we
were
accused
of
killing
him
i
would
be
regarded
in
the
eye
of
the
law
as
equally
guilty
with
you
i
appeal
to
spalding
if
this
is
not
so
h
is
right
replied
spalding
as
he
sent
a
column
of
smoke
wreathing
upward
from
his
lips
such
is
the
law
we
must
buy
this
fellow
off
smith
said
the
doctor
we
must
buy
him
off
he
an
old
hunter
known
as
such
and
he
take
to
himself
all
the
glory
and
what
is
worse
the
world
will
believe
him
spread
himself
beyond
all
bounds
he
shine
beyond
endurance
upon
the
strength
of
this
bear
we
must
buy
him
off
it
is
against
all
conscience
but
there
is
no
help
for
it
we
must
buy
him
off
an
impudence
in
this
claim
which
reminds
me
of
an
anecdote
related
by
noah
by
noah
asked
smith
interrupting
him
noah
who
what
ignorance
there
is
in
this
world
even
in
these
days
of
educational
enlightenment
remarked
the
doctor
to
spalding
and
myself
now
here
is
a
decently
informed
gentleman
claiming
to
be
a
christian
man
to
have
studied
the
bible
and
do
know
who
noah
was
such
an
instance
of
human
ignorance
in
these
times
is
shocking
oh
i
understand
now
said
smith
he
was
the
gentleman
who
built
the
ark
well
go
on
with
your
anecdote
well
as
i
was
saying
the
doctor
resumed
this
claim
of
h
to
a
share
of
the
glory
of
slaying
the
bear
reminds
me
of
an
anecdote
related
by
noah
soon
after
the
subsidence
of
the
flood
and
it
shows
that
impudence
is
at
least
not
in
its
origin
it
seems
that
there
were
in
the
world
before
as
well
as
after
the
flood
some
very
meddling
impudent
fellows
who
were
always
interfering
with
other
people
business
claiming
a
share
of
other
people
credit
trying
to
make
the
world
believe
that
they
were
great
things
and
persuading
everybody
that
whatever
remarkable
achievement
was
accomplished
occurred
through
their
counsel
and
advice
and
as
a
consequence
claiming
a
large
share
of
all
the
honors
going
well
after
the
rain
had
continued
falling
for
a
number
of
days
and
the
valleys
were
all
full
of
water
and
the
angry
surges
went
roaring
with
the
voice
of
ten
thousand
thunders
high
up
along
the
sides
of
the
hills
one
of
these
pestilent
fellows
deriding
the
miraculous
exhibition
going
on
all
around
him
undertook
in
his
to
lead
the
people
to
a
place
of
safety
so
he
selected
a
lofty
peak
that
shot
up
from
a
range
of
mountains
and
commenced
travelling
up
its
steep
acclivities
but
the
flood
followed
him
roaring
and
boiling
and
heaving
in
its
onward
rush
day
by
day
night
by
night
it
crept
up
and
up
higher
and
higher
until
the
leader
who
scoffed
at
the
supernatural
warning
had
but
a
mighty
small
place
above
the
surge
whereon
to
shelter
himself
from
the
destruction
that
surrounded
him
about
that
time
the
ark
with
noah
and
his
people
all
safe
and
snug

drifting

way
says
the
occupant
of

and
take
us
aboard
the

getting
pretty
bad
and
it

the

the

believe
there
going
to
be
much
of
a
shower
after
all
in

drifted
that

again
the

disappeared
beneath

and
the

were
all
gone
i
give
up
my
claim
said
i
doctor
in
consideration
of
your
anecdote
take
the
glory
of
killing
the
bear
i
see
you
not
disposed
to
give
me
a
place
in
your
ark
so
toss
up
the
dollar
the
dollar
was
tossed
up
and
smith
won
the
glory
chapter
xxi
the
doctor
and
his
wife
on
a
fishing
excursion
the
law
of
the
case
women
the
right
to
the
glory
of
having
killed
the
bear
being
settled
the
doctor
addressing
himself
to
spalding
remarked
there
was
something
in
h
appeal
to
you
about
the
law
of
his
case
that
reminded
me
of
a
little
scene
between
my
wife
and
myself
many
years
ago
when
we
were
both
younger
than
we
are
now
and
certainly
had
never
anticipated
the
dark
years
of
trial
through
which
we
were
unexpectedly
called
upon
to
pass
you
know
that
i
started
in
life
like
smith
here
a
gentleman
of
fortune
calculating
like
him
to
live
at
my
ease
without
troubling
myself
with
the
cares
of
any
particular
business
as
i
passed
along
still
i
thought
or
rather
my
father
thought
that
it
would
be
well
enough
even
for
a
gentleman
to
have
at
least
a
nominal
title
to
some
profession
so
i
studied
the
law
and
was
admitted
as
an
attorney
and
counsellor
of
the
courts
never
intending
to
practise
i
did
not
become
very
profoundly
learned
in
the
profession
still
i
became
to
some
extent
indoctrinated
with
its
mysteries
i
did
not
like
it
and
when
the
necessity
for
some
active
employment
came
looming
up
in
the
distance
i
chose
a
different
calling
and
at
commenced
the
study
of
my
present
profession
this
did
not
occur
until
after
i
had
been
married
some
three
years
i
lived
in
the
country
then
or
rather
summered
there
in
a
beautiful
little
village
in
the
interior
of
the
state
in
a
pleasant
house
which
my
father
built
and
which
as
i
was
his
only
heir
i
supposed
of
course
i
owned
some
half
a
dozen
miles
from
the
village
was
a
fine
trout
stream
to
which
my
wife
and
myself
used
occasionally
to
go
on
a
fishing
excursion
on
such
occasions
we
went
on
horseback
as
the
road
was
somewhat
rough
and
my
wife
was
as
much
at
home
in
the
saddle
as
i
was
this
i
repeat
was
a
good
while
ago
and
we
were
both
a
score
of
years
younger
than
we
are
now
well
i
started
out
alone
one
day
to
visit
this
trout
stream
anticipating
a
good
time
with
its
speckled
and
usually
greedy
inhabitants
i
say
i
was
alone
and
yet
there
was
with
me
all
the
way
and
all
the
time
one
who
can
talk
reason
philosophise
understand
things
as
well
as
you
or
i
and
one
to
all
appearance
as
much
and
distinctly
human
as
you
or
i
impossible
exclaimed
smith
we
ca
go
that
doctor
i
stand
my
quarter
of
that
foolish
man
continued
the
doctor
i
say
i
was
alone
let
me
demonstrate
my
proposition
blackstone
says
and
what
he
says
every
lawyer
will
concede
is
the
end
of
the
law
and
the
beginning
too
for
that
matter
that
when
a
woman
becomes
a
wife
she
loses
her
identity
becomes
nobody
that
her
husband
absorbs
her
existence
as
it
were
as
he
does
her
goods
and
chattels
in
his
own
now
sir
do
you
comprehend
my
wife
was
with
me
and
she
being
according
to
law
nobody
of
course
i
was
alone
you
sir
being
a
law
abiding
man
must
admit
that
my
proposition
is
the
doctrine
of
absorption
as
i
call
it
is
convenient
it
promotes
harmony
of
action
by
subjecting
it
to
the
control
of
a
single
will
thus
avoiding
all
embarrassment
from
a
conflict
of
opinion
between
man
and
wife
so
on
my
way
to
the
trout
stream
i
say
way
for
though
my
wife
was
on
horseback
by
my
side
yet
she
being
according
to
the
best
legal
authorities
nobody
you
see
i
was
alone
i
thought
i
would
enlighten
the
good
lady
in
regard
to
the
true
position
or
rather
the
no
position
at
all
which
she
occupied
our
way
lay
for
a
couple
of
miles
along
an
old
road
towards
a
clearing
which
had
been
abandoned
and
through
which
the
stream
flowed
the
tall
old
trees
spread
their
long
arms
over
us
clothed
in
the
rich
verdure
of
spring
and
the
breeze
so
fresh
and
fragrant
moaned
and
sighed
and
whispered
among
the
leaves
dear
said
i
blandly
as
we
rode
along
the
birds
singing
merrily
among
the
branches
above
us
you
know
that
you
are
nobody
w
i
was
simply
w
then
i
had
not
become
nor
even
dreamed
that
i
should
become
a
doctor
w
did
you
say
nobody
nobody
said
i
perfect
nonentity
you
are
less
even
than
a
legal
fiction
you
said
she
as
she
applied
the
whip
to
her
pony
in
a
way
that
brought
him
with
a
bound
across
the
road
directly
in
front
of
me
she
rode
like
a
belted
knight
obstructing
my
progress
you
w
and
there
was
a
red
spot
on
her
cheek
and
her
eye
sparkled
like
the
sheen
of
a
diamond
us
settle
this
matter
now
i
can
bear
being
of
small
consideration
occupying
very
little
space
in
the
world
but
to
be
stricken
out
of
existence
entirely
to
possess
no
legal
identity
to
be
regarded
as
absolutely
nobody
is
a
thing
i
do
intend
to
stand
mark
that
mr
w
cool
my
dear
said
i
us
argue
this
matter
i
was
calm
for
i
knew
the
law
was
on
my
side
i
had
the
books
and
the
courts
and
the
statutes
all
in
my
favor
i
was
fortified
you
see
the
matter
she
exclaimed
till
it
is
admitted
that
somebody
if
i
nobody
i
ca
be
argued
with
i
ca
reason
nor
talk
now
w
i
a
tongue
truth
said
i
the
authorities
may
say
but
we
will
admit
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
that
you
are
somebody
blackstone
says
on
blackstone
she
exclaimed
do
i
care
for
blackstone
whose
bones
have
been
mouldering
in
the
grave
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
for
what
i
know
do
talk
to
me
about
blackstone
my
dear
you
are
wife
and
blackstone
says
do
care
a
fig
what
blackstone
says
if
i
your
wife
i
am
my
mother
daughter
and
my
brother
sister
and
tommy
mother
and
there
are
four
distinct
individualities
all
centered
in
myself
said
i
again
says
that
blackstone
she
exclaimed
do
believe
he
has
driven
the
wits
out
of
the
man
head
now
look
you
w
you
invited
me
to
ride
with
you
you
now
say
i
am
nobody
very
well
if
nobody
leaves
you
i
suppose
you
wo
be
without
company
for
somebody
certainly
left
home
with
you
this
morning
and
has
rode
with
you
thus
far
so
w
success
to
your
fishing
w
and
she
struck
into
a
gallop
towards
home
said
i
give
up
the
point
i
take
back
all
i
said
my
good
wife
if
blackstone
does
say
a
word
more
about
blackstone
said
she
shaking
her
whip
half
serious
half
playfully
at
me
i
go
with
you
i
go
as
somebody
a
legal
entity
well
said
i
drop
the
argument
the
argument
but
the
fact
w
and
admit
that
blackstone
was
a
goose
and
that
his
law
like
his
logic
is
all
nonsense
when
measured
by
the
standard
of
common
sense
and
practical
fact
admit
that
a
woman
when
she
becomes
a
wife
does
not
become
a
mere
nonentity
or
i
leave
you
to
journey
alone
well
my
dear
let
us
see
if
we
can
not
compromise
this
matter
suppose
we
allow
his
philosophy
to
stand
as
a
general
truth
making
you
an
exception
we
say
that
wives
in
general
are
nobody
but
that
you
shall
be
exempt
from
the
general
rule
and
be
considered
always
hereafter
and
as
between
ourselves
as
somebody
you
see
the
shrewdness
of
my
proposition
firstly
it
saved
blackstone
secondly
it
saved
let
me
down
easy
and
thirdly
it
appealed
to
the
womanly
vanity
of
my
wife
and
it
took
well
she
said
as
she
brought
her
pony
alongside
of
me
and
we
jogged
along
cosily
together
see
no
objection
to
that
other
wives
can
take
care
of
themselves
but
this
compromise
as
between
w
must
be
a
no
nebraska
traps
w
no
kansas
bills
hereafter
it
must
be
a
finality
mind
well
said
i
and
a
robin
that
was
building
its
nest
on
a
limb
that
hung
over
the
road
paused
in
its
labors
and
burst
into
song
and
the
burden
of
its
lay
seemed
to
be
a
compromise
which
in
truth
should
be
a
finality
we
were
successful
in
our
fishing
and
we
followed
the
custom
as
to
bait
we
discarded
the
fly
using
only
the
at
the
foot
of
the
ripples
under
the
old
logs
where
the
water
went
whirling
under
the
cavernous
banks
in
the
eddies
among
the
driftwood
everywhere
we
found
trout
not
large
none
weighing
over
six
ounces
and
few
less
than
three
we
caught
my
basket
full
in
less
then
two
hours
and
then
rode
home
it
was
a
day
of
enjoyment
to
us
you
may
be
sure
and
now
i
appeal
to
you
in
all
seriousness
my
friend
the
doctor
continued
addressing
himself
to
spalding
if
there
is
not
something
due
to
the
wives
and
mothers
of
the
present
generation
is
there
not
some
relaxation
of
the
law
necessary
in
vindication
of
the
civilization
of
the
age
against
the
legal
barbarisms
still
remaining
on
the
statute
books
and
adhered
to
by
the
common
law
in
regard
to
wives
and
mothers
is
the
current
of
progress
to
flow
by
them
for
ever
bearing
no
reforms
which
shall
affect
them
do
not
misunderstand
me
i
am
no
advocate
of
the
practices
of
the
women
who
hold
their
conventions
and
public
meetings
who
unsex
themselves
by
mounting
the
forum
and
throwing
off
the
retiring
modesty
of
the
true
woman
seek
to
secure
notoriety
at
the
price
of
popular
contempt
but
there
are
evils
which
bear
heavily
too
heavily
upon
the
women
even
of
this
country
and
which
for
the
credit
of
the
civilization
of
the
age
should
be
corrected
as
philanthropic
men
we
the
american
people
should
look
into
this
subject
and
regardless
of
jeer
and
scoff
do
what
justice
humanity
and
the
right
demand
of
us
in
regard
to
some
of
the
social
and
legal
inequalities
between
the
sexes
pertaining
to
the
married
state
it
is
one
of
the
mysteries
of
our
system
of
jurisprudence
replied
spalding
that
while
everything
else
is
on
the
move
while
progress
is
written
in
letters
of
living
light
upon
all
other
things
that
remains
stationary
at
least
in
a
comparative
sense
the
world
moves
on
civilization
advances
science
and
the
arts
stride
forward
but
the
law
stands
still
a
principle
which
may
have
been
somewhat
changed
modified
bent
if
you
please
into
an
adaptation
to
the
exigencies
of
the
present
and
a
fitness
for
the
changed
circumstances
of
the
times
in
which
we
live
is
suddenly
thrown
back
into
its
old
position
by
the
exhumation
of
some
from
the
dust
of
ages
made
by
some
judge
away
back
in
the
olden
times
resurrected
by
the
research
of
some
antiquarian
lawyer
who
loves
to
delve
among
the
rubbish
of
past
generations
the
learning
the
wisdom
the
philosophy
of
the
present
is
discarded
and
the
spirits
of
a
lower
civilization
are
conjured
from
the
darkness
of
vanished
centuries
to
settle
rules
for
the
government
of
commerce
personal
conduct
and
the
social
relations
of
the
times
in
which
we
live
there
seems
to
be
something
paradoxical
in
the
idea
that
the
older
the
decision
the
better
the
law
the
more
ancient
the
commentator
the
profounder
the
wisdom
of
his
axioms
this
might
be
well
were
it
true
that
civilization
is
backwards
the
science
of
government
retrograding
in
that
case
it
would
of
course
be
true
that
the
nearer
you
approach
the
fountain
the
purer
the
stream
would
be
but
such
is
not
the
fact
in
all
these
attributes
the
world
is
on
the
advance
the
science
of
government
progressive
and
to
make
the
wisdom
of
centuries
ago
override
the
wisdom
or
overshadow
the
light
of
the
present
is
a
paradox
peculiar
to
our
system
of
jurisprudence
there
are
lawyers
and
judges
who
enjoy
a
high
reputation
whose
fame
rests
upon
their
profound
research
among
the
tomes
of
law
and
whose
glory
consists
in
their
familiarity
with
the
opinions
and
axioms
of
men
who
lived
and
died
so
long
ago
that
their
very
tombs
are
forgotten
this
class
of
lawyers
and
jurists
hold
in
contempt
all
the
learning
the
philosophy
the
practical
wisdom
of
the
present
rejecting
everything
that
is
not
bearded
and
hoary
with
age
seated
in
their
libraries
in
the
midst
of
their
ponderous
octavos
their
roman
and
volumes
they
reject
with
disdain
the
commentators
the
opinions
of
the
jurists
of
the
present
century
and
brushing
away
the
cobwebs
and
dust
from
the
covers
of
their
treasured
relics
of
bygone
ages
they
clasp
them
in
a
loving
embrace
close
to
their
hearts
exclaiming
are
my
jewels
whatever
has
not
the
sanction
of
ancient
authority
is
folly
to
them
worse
than
folly
for
it
is
innovation
and
that
is
rank
impiety
i
remember
an
anecdote
of
the
celebrated
william
wirt
related
to
show
how
ready
his
mind
was
how
instant
in
activity
and
how
suddenly
it
would
flash
with
an
eloquence
superior
to
that
exhibited
by
the
most
elaborate
preparation
he
was
arguing
a
cause
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
laid
down
as
the
basis
of
his
argument
a
principle
to
which
he
desired
to
call
the
particular
attention
of
the
judges
the
opposing
counsel
interrupted
him
calling
for
the
authority
sustaining
his
principle
book
the
book
demanded
his
adversary
and
your
honors
said
wirt
straightening
himself
up
to
his
full
height
am
not
bound
to
grope
my
way
among
the
ruins
of
antiquity
to
stumble
over
obsolete
statutes
or
delve
in
black
letter
law
in
search
of
a
principle
written
in
living
letters
upon
the
heart
of
every
man
if
the
idea
contained
in
this
answer
of
wirt
were
more
fully
appreciated
by
our
modern
jurists
it
would
be
all
the
better
for
the
country
the
common
law
is
said
to
be
the
perfection
of
reason
this
is
doubtless
true
but
it
is
the
perfection
of
the
reason
of
the
present
as
well
as
of
the
past
its
principles
are
elastic
suiting
themselves
to
the
civilization
of
all
ages
they
are
progressive
keeping
pace
with
the
progress
of
all
times
they
are
not
immutable
save
in
the
element
of
right
and
they
therefore
shape
themselves
to
all
circumstances
moving
along
with
the
onward
march
of
trade
the
commerce
the
social
relations
and
business
of
the
people
the
learning
of
the
wisdom
the
philosophy
of
is
profounder
than
that
of
any
preceding
century
and
it
is
folly
to
overthrow
it
by
or
compel
it
to
give
place
to
the
learning
the
wisdom
the
philosophy
of
departed
and
ruder
ages
in
regard
to
your
question
whether
there
is
not
some
relaxation
of
the
law
necessary
in
vindication
of
the
civilization
of
the
age
against
the
legal
barbarisms
remaining
upon
the
statute
book
and
in
the
common
law
in
regard
to
our
wives
i
answer
frankly
that
i
do
not
know
about
that
the
law
as
you
read
it
in
blackstone
and
as
you
expounded
it
to
your
wife
on
your
fishing
excursion
has
been
somewhat
modified
wives
have
been
given
a
by
modern
legislation
and
a
woman
by
becoming
a
wife
does
not
now
cease
to
be
a
legal
entity
the
law
permits
her
to
retain
and
control
her
property
irrespective
of
her
husband
and
she
has
therefore
thus
far
ceased
to
be
but
my
private
opinion
is
that
as
a
general
thing
the
women
of
this
country
get
along
very
well
even
under
the
pressure
of
the
of
which
you
speak
they
manage
one
way
and
another
to
get
the
upper
hand
of
their
legal
lords
law
or
no
law
if
their
existence
in
the
light
of
authority
is
than
a
legal
fiction
they
come
to
be
regarded
or
make
themselves
felt
in
the
world
as
practical
facts
they
are
quite
as
apt
to
be
at
the
top
as
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
notwithstanding
what
about
their
legal
position
there
is
doubtless
a
good
deal
of
abuse
of
authority
on
the
part
of
husbands
but
the
women
get
their
share
of
the
good
that
is
going
in
the
world
as
a
general
thing
if
the
law
is
against
them
they
manage
to
usurp
full
an
even
amount
of
privilege
and
authority
and
keep
along
about
in
line
with
the
other
sex
i
never
knew
an
out
and
out
controversy
between
a
man
and
his
wife
in
which
the
former
did
not
get
the
worst
of
it
in
the
end
and
as
to
the
impositions
which
as
a
melancholy
truth
are
too
frequent
they
are
about
as
much
on
one
side
as
the
other
it
is
not
to
legal
enactments
that
we
must
look
for
the
cure
of
unhappiness
incident
to
the
married
state
but
to
a
reform
in
temper
and
habits
of
life
besides
i
do
not
believe
the
wives
of
this
country
would
accept
of
a
strict
legal
equality
at
all
if
it
were
tendered
them
as
a
finality
i
believe
they
would
prefer
remaining
as
they
are
for
by
being
so
they
are
left
to
the
resources
of
their
own
genius
to
win
by
their
tact
what
is
not
guaranteed
by
law
i
know
that
there
are
a
good
many
people
in
pantaloons
as
well
as
petticoats
who
go
about
laboring
for
the
of
women
as
if
the
heavens
and
earth
were
coming
together
but
those
of
them
who
wear
skirts
generally
have
delicate
white
hands
flowing
curls
flashing
black
eyes
and
the
gift
of
oratory
and
a
desire
to
exhibit
them
all
while
those
in
pantaloons
have
their
hair
combed
smoothly
back
as
if
preparing
to
be
swallowed
by
a
wear
white
cravats
talk
softly
and
show
a
good
deal
of
the
whites
of
their
eyes
from
a
chronic
habit
of
looking
up
towards
the
moon
and
stars
as
a
general
thing
these
latter
are
of
no
practical
use
in
the
world
and
make
as
good
a
tail
to
the
kite
of
the
women
as
anything
else
but
these
people
represent
a
very
small
portion
of
the
american
women
and
until
the
masses
demand
i
rather
think
that
matters
had
better
be
permitted
to
remain
as
they
are

of
themselves
no

a
beautiful
flower
a
new
lake
a
moose
his
capture
a
sumptuous
dinner
we
started
the
next
morning
on
an
exploring
voyage
up
the
stream
which
enters
this
beautiful
lake
some
half
a
mile
west
of
the
one
we
had
looked
into
the
day
before
on
either
hand
as
we
passed
along
the
narrow
channel
was
a
natural
meadow
covered
with
a
luxuriant
growth
of
rank
grass
and
weeds
conspicuous
among
which
was
a
beautiful
flower
the
like
of
which
i
have
never
seen
anywhere
else
i
am
no
botanist
and
therefore
can
not
describe
it
in
the
language
of
the
florist
so
that
the
learned
in
that
beautiful
science
might
classify
it
it
resembles
somewhat
the
wild
lily
in
shape
growing
upon
a
tall
strong
stem
almost
like
the
stem
of
the
flag
the
flower
itself
is
double
and
its
deep
crimson
the
deepest
almost
of
any
flower
i
have
ever
seen
shone
conspicuously
as
it
waved
gracefully
in
the
breeze
above
the
surrounding
vegetation
it
has
one
defect
however
it
is
without
fragrance
i
infer
from
the
fact
that
its
roots
spread
far
out
every
way
and
reach
down
into
the
water
beneath
that
it
can
hardly
be
transferred
to
the
garden
or
become
civilized
it
would
be
a
great
acquisition
to
the
collection
of
the
florist
if
it
could
for
i
know
of
no
flower
that
excels
it
in
richness
of
color
gracefulness
of
appearance
or
in
gorgeousness
of
beauty
we
saw
abundance
of
deer
feeding
quietly
upon
the
narrow
meadows
and
upon
the
lily
pads
on
our
way
we
had
no
inclination
to
injure
them
and
we
let
them
feed
on
some
of
them
were
hugely
astonished
however
at
our
presence
and
dashed
away
whistling
and
snorting
into
the
forest
two
miles
from
the
lake
we
came
to
a
rocky
barrier
down
which
the
stream
came
rushing
and
roaring
for
fifty
or
sixty
rods
in
a
descent
of
perhaps
sixty
feet
in
all
around
these
rapids
the
boats
were
carried
and
we
found
above
them
the
water
deep
and
sluggish
flowing
through
a
dense
forest
the
tall
trees
on
the
banks
stretching
their
leafy
arms
across
the
narrow
channel
forming
above
it
an
arch
delightfully
cool
through
which
the
sunlight
could
scarcely
penetrate
we
followed
this
channel
a
long
way
when
we
came
to
a
little
lake
or
pond
four
or
five
miles
in
circumference
it
was
a
perfect
gem
laying
there
all
alone
so
calm
so
lovely
in
its
solitude
with
no
sign
of
civilization
around
it
no
sound
of
civilization
startling
its
echoes
from
their
sleep
of
ages
no
human
voice
having
perhaps
ever
been
heard
upon
its
shore
since
the
red
man
departed
from
the
of
his
fathers
the
shores
all
around
it
were
bold
and
rocky
save
on
the
western
side
where
a
broad
sandy
beach
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
extent
lay
between
the
water
and
the
shadow
of
the
deep
forest
beyond
a
solitary
island
of
half
a
dozen
acres
covered
with
majestic
pines
and
tall
straight
spruce
trees
rises
near
the
centre
of
the
lake
adding
a
new
charm
to
its
quiet
beauty
the
waters
of
this
little
lake
are
clearer
and
more
transparent
than
those
of
any
other
we
had
seen
we
could
see
the
white
shells
on
its
sandy
bottom
fifteen
feet
below
the
surface
this
peculiarity
induced
us
to
believe
that
we
were
above
the
stratum
of
iron
ore
which
seems
to
underlay
most
of
this
wild
region
coloring
while
it
does
not
render
impure
the
waters
of
most
of
these
lakes
and
rivers
i
have
frequently
in
my
wanderings
in
these
northern
wilds
stumbled
upon
outcropping
orebeds
which
were
they
nearer
market
or
more
accessible
to
the
energy
and
enterprise
of
the
american
people
would
be
capable
of
building
up
gigantic
fortunes
but
they
are
all
valueless
here
and
probably
will
continue
so
for
generations
to
come
we
saw
the
fresh
tracks
of
a
moose
on
the
sandy
beach
tracks
that
had
been
made
that
morning
and
we
concluded
to
spend
the
day
here
in
the
hope
of
securing
one
of
these
gigantic
deer
we
rowed
to
the
island
intending
to
encamp
there
we
entered
a
little
bay
of
half
an
acre
the
points
forming
it
coming
within
a
few
yards
of
each
other
and
the
branches
of
the
trees
intertwining
their
long
arms
lovingly
above
as
we
landed
our
dogs
began
nosing
and
dashing
about
as
if
suddenly
roused
into
excitement
by
the
hot
scent
of
some
animal
that
had
been
disturbed
by
our
coming
they
broke
into
a
simultaneous
cry
and
plunged
like
mad
into
the
thicket
we
pushed
our
boat
back
towards
the
open
water
when
we
heard
the
plunge
of
some
animal
into
the
lake
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
martin
who
was
in
the
leading
boat
with
me
by
a
few
vigorous
pulls
at
the
oar
rounded
the
point
between
us
and
the
spot
where
we
had
heard
the
plunge
and
there
not
ten
rods
from
the
shore
making
for
the
mainland
was
the
game
which
of
all
others
we
most
desired
to
see
a
moose
by
moses
exclaimed
martin
in
huge
excitement
hurrah
hurrah
a
moose
he
ours
he
ca
escape
and
away
he
dashed
in
pursuit
the
other
boats
now
hove
in
sight
and
a
loud
hurrah
went
up
from
each
when
they
saw
the
nature
of
the
game
that
had
been
started
there
was
no
difficulty
in
overtaking
the
animal
desperate
as
were
his
efforts
to
escape
we
shot
past
him
and
turned
him
back
in
a
direction
towards
the
island
again
and
i
picked
up
my
rifle
to
settle
the
matter
do
shoot
him
said
martin
do
shoot
him
yet
he
ca
get
away
and
if
you
kill
him
he
sink
and
if
he
do
we
ca
get
him
into
the
boat
let
us
drive
him
back
to
the
island
the
other
boats
were
by
this
time
up
with
us
every
man
in
a
wild
state
of
excitement
eager
to
be
first
in
at
the
death
we
had
headed
the
animal
towards
the
island
with
our
three
boats
so
arranged
as
that
he
could
swim
in
no
other
direction
without
running
one
of
them
down
the
dogs
had
started
a
deer
that
had
taken
to
the
water
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
look
here
said
i
gentlemen
this
game
is
mine
i
claim
him
by
right
of
discovery
and
my
right
must
not
be
interfered
with
very
well
the
doctor
answered
we
only
take
a
hand
in
his
capture
if
he
likely
to
escape
so
go
ahead
as
we
came
within
a
few
yards
of
the
shore
and
we
could
see
that
the
animal
hoofs
touched
the
bottom
i
aimed
carefully
at
his
head
and
fired
he
made
one
desperate
lunge
forward
and
turned
over
on
his
side
dying
with
scarcely
a
straggle
the
ball
having
passed
directly
through
his
brain
this
was
the
first
and
only
live
moose
i
have
ever
seen
he
was
not
a
large
one
being
probably
a
but
we
should
have
called
him
a
monster
had
we
not
before
that
time
seen
in
various
museums
the
stuffed
skins
of
those
a
quarter
or
a
third
larger
he
would
have
weighed
as
shot
probably
between
five
and
six
hundred
pounds
he
had
made
this
solitary
island
his
home
as
we
ascertained
by
his
spoor
and
other
signs
that
we
found
upon
subsequent
explorations
we
saw
his
bed
but
a
few
rods
from
where
we
landed
and
from
which
our
dogs
had
aroused
him
though
they
in
their
excitement
had
overrun
his
scent
and
dashed
off
after
a
deer
we
had
now
accomplished
one
of
the
objects
of
our
journey
in
this
direction
and
as
the
law
we
had
imposed
upon
ourselves
had
reached
its
limits
prohibiting
our
shooting
another
moose
that
day
even
should
an
opportunity
occur
we
concluded
to
return
to
our
shanty
on
the
lake
below
we
therefore
dressed
our
moose
and
taking
with
us
the
skin
and
hind
quarters
started
down
stream
to
a
late
dinner
on
little
tupper
lake
indeed
there
was
a
sort
of
necessity
for
our
doing
so
we
had
left
our
provisions
there
calculating
to
return
in
the
afternoon
not
having
taken
with
us
even
pepper
or
salt
wherewith
to
season
the
food
which
upon
constraint
we
might
cook
during
our
absence
a
few
crackers
in
the
pockets
of
each
was
all
in
the
provision
line
that
we
had
provided
ourselves
with
and
though
when
we
saw
the
in
the
sand
we
had
concluded
to
rough
it
for
a
single
night
for
the
chance
of
securing
such
rare
game
yet
having
secured
it
that
part
of
our
mission
was
accomplished
and
we
turned
towards
home
on
our
return
to
the
lake
spalding
and
myself
rowed
across
to
the
mouth
of
a
cold
brook
to
procure
a
supply
of
fresh
trout
upon
which
with
our
moose
and
to
dine
this
we
soon
accomplished
and
on
our
arrival
home
we
found
huge
pieces
of
moose
and
bear
roasting
before
a
blazing
fire
the
meat
was
supported
upon
long
sticks
one
end
of
which
was
sharpened
and
the
meat
spitted
upon
it
and
the
other
thrust
into
the
ground
in
a
slanting
direction
so
as
to
bring
the
roasting
pieces
into
a
proper
position
before
the
fire
the
meat
was
removed
occasionally
and
turned
until
the
roasting
process
was
completed
and
then
served
up
on
clean
birch
bark
just
peeled
from
the
trees
in
the
place
of
platters
we
had
tin
plates
knives
and
forks
with
us
also
a
tin
cups
and
tea
of
the
choicest
quality
sugar
pepper
salt
and
pork
the
man
who
can
not
make
a
meal
where
the
viands
present
are
bear
jerked
venison
fresh
trout
and
pork
and
for
drink
the
best
of
tea
and
the
purest
and
coldest
spring
water
had
better
keep
out
of
the
rackett
woods
the
people
whoever
they
were
who
prepared
the
camp
in
which
we
were
domiciled
had
an
eye
to
convenience
and
comfort
the
shanty
was
built
of
logs
on
three
sides
the
crevices
between
which
were
filled
with
moss
and
the
sloping
roof
neatly
covered
with
bark
in
layers
like
an
roof
covered
with
split
shingles
the
front
was
open
and
directly
before
it
was
a
rough
with
jams
made
of
small
boulders
laid
up
with
clay
as
if
intended
for
a
kitchen
this
was
three
or
four
feet
high
and
served
an
excellent
purpose
with
reference
to
our
cookery
and
the
lighting
of
our
shanty
at
night
it
served
also
to
conduct
the
smoke
upward
and
prevented
it
from
being
blown
into
our
faces
as
we
sat
in
front
at
once
of
our
and
our
the
only
things
that
reminded
us
of
civilization
aside
from
what
we
carried
with
us
were
the
innumerable
crickets
that
through
all
the
night
kept
up
their
chirruping
in
the
crevices
of
this
rude
fireplace
there
was
something
and
sociable
in
their
song
these
with
the
shrill
notes
of
the
little
peepers
along
the
shore
were
old
sounds
to
us
familiar
voices
and
they
fell
pleasantly
on
the
ear
we
had
finished
our
meal
and
taken
to
our
pipes
in
the
evening
as
the
sun
went
down
among
the
old
forests
away
off
in
the
west
the
greyness
of
twilight
came
stealing
over
the
water
and
grew
into
darkness
in
the
beautiful
valley
where
that
lake
lay
sleeping
the
stars
stole
out
silently
and
set
their
watch
in
the
sky
and
calmness
and
repose
rested
upon
everything
around
us
i
remember
said
smith
the
first
year
that
i
was
in
college
of
hearing
two
learned
professors
disputing
about
what
sort
of
animal
it
was
that
made
the
piping
noise
we
hear
in
the
marshy
places
and
stagnant
pools
in
the
spring
time
usually
known
as
peepers
one
insisted
that
it
was
a
newt
or
small
lizard
and
i
remember
that
he
went
to
his
library
and
brought
a
volume
which
proved
his
theory
to
be
correct
the
other
denied
the
authority
of
the
author
and
insisted
that
the
peeper
was
a
frog
the
discussion
excited
my
curiosity
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
satisfy
myself
on
the
subject
if
possible
by
occular
demonstration
there
was
a
small
marshy
place
half
a
mile
or
so
from
the
college
grounds
from
which
i
had
heard
in
my
walks
the
music
of
the
peepers
coming
up
every
evening
in
a
loud
and
joyous
chorus
i
watched
by
it
a
number
of
evenings
and
though
there
were
a
plenty
of
peepers
piping
merrily
enough
yet
i
could
not
get
sight
of
one
to
save
me
i
began
to
think
it
was
a
myth
the
viewless
spirit
of
the
bog
that
made
all
the
noises
about
which
the
learned
professors
had
been
disputing
at
last
however
i
got
sight
of
a
peeper
caught
him
in
the
act
and
saw
that
it
was
in
fact
a
little
frog
nothing
more
nothing
less
he
was
not
more
than
three
feet
from
me
and
though
when
i
moved
he
hid
himself
in
the
muddy
water
yet
i
managed
to
capture
and
take
him
home
alive
he
was
a
little
animal
certainly
not
larger
than
a
piece
and
it
was
marvellous
how
a
thing
so
small
could
make
such
a
loud
and
piercing
noise
i
took
him
to
my
room
and
placed
him
in
a
box
in
which
i
fashioned
an
artificial
bog
in
the
hope
that
he
would
confirm
my
testimony
by
his
piping
the
second
evening
as
i
sat
in
my
room
poring
over
the
recitations
of
the
morrow
he
lifted
up
his
voice
loud
shrill
and
clear
as
when
singing
in
his
native
marsh
i
hurried
in
triumph
to
the
learned
disputants
about
his
identity
and
in
their
presence
he
furnished
unanswerable
evidence
that
the
peeper
was
a
frog
and
not
a
newt
i
was
complimented
by
both
the
learned
pundits
as
though
i
had
added
a
great
item
to
the
aggregate
of
human
knowledge
you
do
a
great
thing
my
friend
said
spalding
you
solved
a
mystery
about
which
men
wise
in
the
learning
of
the
books
had
perhaps
been
disputing
for
centuries
what
are
the
peepers
asked
the
naturalist
who
listened
to
their
piping
notes
from
the
marshy
places
in
the
spring
time
it
was
a
matter
of
small
practical
importance
what
they
were
still
it
was
a
question
which
mind
wanted
to
have
solved
its
solution
would
do
no
great
amount
of
good
to
the
world
but
then
it
was
a
mystery
which
it
was
the
business
of
mind
to
lay
bare
and
what
more
has
science
done
in
tracing
the
history
and
progress
of
this
earth
of
ours
as
written
upon
the
rocks
among
which
geology
has
been
so
long
delving
are
the
peepers
asked
the
naturalist
are
newts
little
lizards
answers
a
learned
pandit
are
spirits
of
the
bog
myths
that
hold
their
carnival
in
the
early
grass
of
the
marshy
pools
says
the
theorist
and
poet
who
in
the
idealities
of
a
poetic
fancy
are
frogs
says
a
third
who
is
ready
to
chop
any
amount
of
logic
in
favor
of
his
system
of

hereupon
columns
of
argument
and
pages
of
learned
discussion
have
been
held
over
the
identity
of
the
jolly
peepers
of
the
but
you
discarded
logic
threw
away
argument
and
came
down
to
the
sure
demonstrations
of
sober
fact
you
watched
by
the
marshy
pool
and
caught
the
in
the
act
took
him
flagrante
as
the
lawyers
say
and
thus
ended
the
theoretical
discussion
about
the
you
placed
another
fixed
fact
upon
the
page
of
natural
history
and
how
often
has
the
wisdom
of
the
schools
the
philosophy
of
the
profoundest
theorists
been
overthrown
by
the
simple
demonstrations
of
practical
facts
for
a
thousand
years
the
world
was
in
pursuit
of
the
giant
power
that
lay
hidden
in
heated
vapor
the
steam
that
came
floating
up
from
boiling
water
that
power
eluded
the
grasp
and
baffled
the
research
of
human
genius
which
was
looking
so
earnestly
after
it
until
ingenuity
gave
it
up
and
philosophy
pronounced
it
a
delusion
not
far
from
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
practical
experiment
began
to
develop
the
mysterious
power
of
steam
rudely
and
imperfectly
harnessed
at
first
it
still
made
the
great
wheel
revolve
and
men
talked
about
making
it
a
great
motor
for
mechanical
purposes
philosophy
volunteered
its
demonstrations
of
the
absolute
impossibility
of
such
a
thing
still
human
ingenuity
felt
its
way
carefully
onward
until
the
great
fact
was
developed
that
steam
was
in
truth
capable
of
moving
machinery
was
endowed
almost
with
vitality
and
could
be
made
to
throw
the
shuttle
and
spin
ingenious
men
hinted
that
it
might
be
made
to
propel
in
the
place
of
wind
and
sails
and
thus
be
harnessed
into
the
service
of
commerce
as
it
had
already
been
into
that
of
manufactures
here
again
philosophy
interposed
its
axioms
and
declared
the
scheme
among
the
wild
vagaries
of
a
distempered
fancy
but
years
rolled
on
and
the
tall
ship
that
swung
out
upon
the
broad
ocean
and
moved
forward
when
the
air
was
still
and
calmness
was
on
the
face
of
the
deep
forward
in
the
eye
of
the
wind
forward
in
the
teeth
of
the
storm
that
stopped
not
for
billow
or
blast
gave
the
lie
to
philosophy
and
scattered
the
theory
of
the
wise
like
chaff
the
lightning
that
fierce
spirit
of
the
storm
that
darted
down
on
its
mission
of
destruction
from
the
black
cloud
floating
in
the
sky
became
a
thing
of
interest
to
the
mechanical
world
and
the
question
was
asked
can
not
the
lightning
be
harnessed
into
the
service
of
man
and
be
made
utilitarian
philosophy
sneered
at
the
wild
delusion
but
see
how
that
same
subtle
and
mysterious
agency
has
been
conquered
note
how
truthfully
it
carries
every
word
intrusted
to
its
charge
along
thousands
of
miles
of
the
telegraph
wire
with
a
speed
in
comparison
with
which
sound
is
a
laggard
a
speed
that
annihilates
alike
space
and
time
men
looked
into
a
mirror
and
seeing
their
own
counterpart
a
of
themselves
reflected
there
began
to
ask
may
not
that
shadow
be
fixed
fastened
in
some
way
to
remain
upon
the
polished
surface
that
gives
it
back
even
after
the
original
may
be
mouldering
in
the
grave
here
again
philosophy
laid
its
finger
upon
its
nose
and
winked
facetiously
as
if
it
had
found
a
new
subject
for
ridicule
in
the
stupendous
folly
of
such
an
inquiry
but
from
that
simple
question
rose
up
the
daguerreian
art
an
art
which
fixes
upon
metallic
plates
upon
paper
the
shadow
of
a
man
of
palace
and
cottage
of
mountain
and
field
giving
thus
a
picture
ten
thousand
times
truer
to
nature
than
the
pencil
of
the
cunningest
artist
these
and
a
thousand
other
mighty
triumphs
of
human
ingenuity
have
fought
their
way
onward
to
their
present
position
against
the
fogyism
of
philosophy
the
inertia
of
the
schoolmen
they
have
been
the
sequence
of
cold
resistless
demonstrations
of
experiment
and
fact
the
world
would
stand
still
but
for
the
spirit
of
research
for
the
practical
for
experimental
and
not
theoretical
knowledge
that
is
abroad
it
is
this
spirit
that
moves
the
world
in
all
its
present
matchless
career
of
progress
and
distinguishes
our
era
above
all
others
of
the
world
existence
you
may
be
thankful
my
friend
that
you
have
been
able
to
add
another
fixed
fact
to
the
stock
of
human
knowledge
even
though
it
be
only
that
the
is
a
frog
and
not
a
or
a
but
who
would
suppose
that
such
a
tiny
little
frogling
could
make
such
a
loud
shrill
and
sound
who
would
think
that
a
million
of
such
puny
things
could
make
the
air
of
a
summer
evening
so
full
of
the
music
of
their
songs
i
remember
how
in
my
boyhood
i
listened
to
their
voices
which
came
up
loudest
shrillest
merriest
when
twilight
was
spreading
its
grey
mantle
over
the
earth
while
the
song
of
the
birds
was
hushing
into
silence
and
the
coming
darkness
was
lulling
the
things
of
the
day
into
repose
oh
how
merrily
they
sang
along
the
little
brooklet
that
took
its
rise
in
a
spring
in
the
meadow
and
wended
its
way
among
the
young
grass
just
springing
into
verdure
to
the
beautiful
lake
beyond
their
song
is
in
my
ear
now
and
that
meadow
that
beautiful
lake
the
tall
hills
on
the
summits
of
which
the
departing
sunlight
lingered
the
tall
maples
that
clustered
in
their
conelike
beauty
around
that
gushing
fountain
the
clustered
plum
trees
the
giant
oak
spared
by
the
woodman
axe
when
the
old
forest
was
swept
away
the
fields
the
in
the
and
the
beautiful
creek
that
came
cascading
down
the
shelving
rocks
and
leaping
over
precipices
in
which
the
speckled
trout
sported
all
these
are
before
me
now
a
vision
of
loveliness
all
the
more
dear
because
stamped
upon
the
memory
when
life
was
young
oh
time
time
the
wrecks
that
lie
scattered
in
thy
pathway
that
little
brooklet
and
the
peepers
the
fountain
the
maples
and
the
meadow
are
all
gone
the
brave
old
oak
was
riven
by
the
lightning
the
fields
have
crept
up
to
the
very
summit
of
the
hills
and
even
the
stream
that
came
down
from
the
mountain
has
vanished
away
save
when
the
rains
or
the
melting
snows
send
it
in
a
freshet
over
the
rocks
where
when
i
was
a
boy
it
was
cascading
always
that
beautiful
meadow
too
is
gone
and
the
streets
of
a
modern
village
with
blocks
of
houses
and
stores
and
shops
occupy
the
place
where
i
swung
my
first
scythe
the
old
vanished
years
and
years
ago
a
steamboat
ploughs
its
way
through
that
beautiful
lake
and
the
things
of
my
boyhood
are
but
visions
of
memory
called
up
from
the
long
long
past
not
one
landmark
of
the
olden
time
remains
oh

illustration
old
memories
we
spent
the
following
day
in
drifting
quietly
around
the
lake
floating
lazily
in
the
little
bays
under
the
shadow
of
the
tall
trees
and
lounging
upon
small
islands
gathering
the
whortleberries
which
grew
in
abundance
upon
them
we
filled
our
tin
pails
with
this
delicious
fruit
for
a
dessert
for
our
evening
meal
on
one
of
these
islands
we
found
indications
of
its
being
inhabited
by
wood
rabbits
and
we
sent
cullen
to
the
shanty
for
the
dogs
to
course
them
not
however
with
any
intention
of
capturing
them
but
to
enjoy
the
music
of
the
chase
and
hear
the
voices
of
the
hounds
echoing
over
the
water
we
landed
them
upon
the
island
and
began
beating
for
the
game
the
hounds
understanding
that
their
business
was
the
pursuit
of
deer
and
having
hunted
the
island
over
thoroughly
came
back
to
us
and
sat
quietly
down
upon
their
haunches
as
much
as
to
say
there
was
nothing
there
worth
looking
after
but
we
had
seen
one
of
the
little
animals
that
had
been
roused
from
its
bed
by
the
dogs
and
we
called
their
special
attention
to
the
fact
by
leading
them
to
the
spot
and
bidding
them
to
hunt
him
up
they
understood
our
meaning
and
started
on
the
trail
with
a
loud
and
cheerful
cry
for
half
an
hour
they
coursed
him
round
and
round
the
island
making
the
lake
vocal
with
their
merry
music
we
might
have
shot
the
game
they
were
pursuing
fifty
times
but
we
had
no
design
against
its
life
the
little
fellow
did
not
seem
to
be
greatly
alarmed
for
we
noted
him
often
when
by
doubling
he
had
temporarily
thrown
off
the
dogs
squat
himself
down
and
throw
his
long
ears
back
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
that
had
been
pursuing
him
and
when
the
dogs
straightened
upon
his
trail
and
approached
where
he
sat
he
would
bound
nimbly
away
among
the
thick
bushes
to
double
on
them
again
we
called
off
the
dogs
and
passed
on
to
float
along
under
the
shadow
of
the
forest
trees
and
the
hills
and
take
an
occasional
trout
by
way
of
experiment
among
the
broken
rocks
along
the
shore
we
had
dispatched
cullen
to
the
shanty
to
prepare
dinner
for
us
by
six
at
which
hour
we
were
to
be
at
home
cullen
had
promised
to
use
his
own
expression
to
spread
himself
in
the
preparation
of
this
meal
and
he
kept
his
promise
on
our
return
we
found
a
sirloin
of
moose
roasted
to
a
turn
a
stake
of
broiled
on
the
coals
a
stew
of
jerked
venison
and
as
pleasant
a
dish
of
fried
trout
and
pork
as
an
epicure
could
desire
our
appetites
were
keen
and
we
did
ample
justice
to
his
cookery
this
was
one
of
the
most
delightful
evenings
that
i
have
ever
spent
in
the
northern
woods
there
was
such
a
calm
resting
upon
all
things
such
an
impress
of
repose
upon
forest
and
lake
such
a
cheerful
quiet
and
serenity
all
around
us
that
one
could
scarcely
refrain
from
rejoicing
aloud
in
the
beauty
and
the
glory
of
the
hour
as
the
sun
sank
to
his
rest
behind
the
western
hills
and
the
twilight
began
to
gather
in
the
forest
and
over
the
lake
the
moon
rose
over
the
eastern
high
lands
walking
with
a
queenly
step
up
into
the
sky
casting
a
long
line
of
brilliant
light
across
the
waters
showing
the
shadows
of
the
mountains
in
bold
outline
in
the
depths
below
and
paling
the
stars
by
her
brightness
above
we
all
felt
that
we
were
recruiting
in
strength
so
rapidly
in
these
mountain
regions
where
the
air
was
so
bracing
and
pure
under
the
influence
of
exercise
simple
diet
natural
sleep
and
the
absence
of
the
labors
and
cares
of
business
that
we
were
contented
notwithstanding
the
monotony
that
began
to
mark
our
everyday
proceedings
i
have
been
listening
said
spalding
as
we
sat
upon
the
rude
benches
in
front
of
our
indulging
in
our
usual
season
of
smoking
after
our
meals
to
the
song
of
the
crickets
in
those
rude
jams
and
they
call
up
sad
yet
pleasant
memories
from
the
long
past
of
the
old
log
house
the
quiet
the
crane
in
the
jam
the
great
logs
blazing
upon
the
hearth
of
a
cold
winter
evening
the
house
dog
sleeping
quietly
in
the
corner
and
the
cat
nestled
confidingly
between
his
feet
oh
the
days
of
old
the
days
of
old
these
crickets
call
back
with
these
memories
the
circle
that
gathered
around
the
hearth
of
my
home
when
i
was
young
father
mother
brothers
sisters
playmates
and
friends
how
quietly
some
of
them
grew
old
and
ripe
and
then
dropped
into
the
grave
how
quietly
others
stole
away
in
their
youth
to
the
home
of
the
dead
and
how
the
rest
have
drifted
away
on
the
currents
of
life
and
are
lost
to
me
in
the
mists
and
shadows
of
time
even
the
home
and
the
hearth
are
gone
they
with
time
and
slow
decay
until
at
last
they
were
wiped
out
from
the
things
that
are
the
song
of
the
peepers
is
a
pleasant
memory
and
comes
welling
up
with
a
thousand
cherished
recollections
of
our
vanished
youth
but
the
song
of
the
cricket
that
made
its
home
in
the
jams
of
the
great
stone
is
pleasanter
and
the
memories
that
come
floating
back
with
his
remembered
lay
are
pleasanter
still
he
was
always
there
he
was
not
silent
like
the
insect
through
the
spring
month
and
the
cold
of
winter
piping
only
in
sadness
when
the
still
autumnal
evenings
close
in
their
brightness
and
beauty
over
the
earth
but
he
sang
always
and
his
chirrup
was
heard
at
all
seasons
in
the
winter
the
fire
on
the
hearth
warmed
him
in
the
summer
he
had
a
cool
resting
place
and
he
was
cheerful
and
merry
through
all
the
long
year
and
this
reminds
me
of
an
anecdote
of
a
venerable
minister
who
passed
years
ago
to
his
rest
he
was
a
scotchman
and
when
preaching
to
his
own
congregation
at
salem
in
washington
comity
he
indulged
in
broad
scotch
which
to
those
who
were
accustomed
to
it
was
exceedingly
pleasant
i
was
a
boy
then
and
was
returning
with
my
father
from
a
visit
to
vermont
we
stopped
over
the
sabbath
at
salem
and
attended
worship
in
the
neat
little
church
of
that
pleasant
village
there
were
no
railroads
in
those
days
the
iron
horse
had
not
yet
made
his
advent
and
the
scream
of
the
steam
whistle
had
never
startled
the
echoes
that
dwell
among
the
gorges
of
the
green
mountain
state
oh
progress
progress
i
have
travelled
that
same
route
often
since
more
than
once
within
the
year
and
i
flew
over
in
an
hour
what
was
the
work
of
all
that
cold
winter
day
that
brought
us
at
night
to
that
neat
little
village
of
salem
i
thought
as
i
dashed
with
a
rush
over
the
road
i
once
travelled
so
leisurely
how
change
was
written
upon
everything
how
time
and
progress
had
obliterated
all
the
old
landmarks
leaving
scarcely
anything
around
which
memory
could
cling
well
well
it
is
so
everywhere
all
over
the
world
change
improvement
progress
are
the
words
the
venerable
minister
for
his
locks
were
grey
and
time
had
ploughed
deep
furrows
down
his
cheeks
and
draws
palpable
lines
across
his
brow
was
as
my
memory
paints
him
the
personification
of
earnestness
sincerity
and
truth
the
text
and
the
drift
of
the
sermon
i
have
forgotten
save
the
little
fragment
that
fixed
itself
in
my
memory
by
the
singularity
of
the
figure
by
which
he
illustrated
his
meaning
he
was
speaking
of
the
operation
of
the
holy
spirit
upon
the
human
heart
and
how
gently
it
won
men
from
their
sinful
ways
he
said
was
not
boisterous
like
the
rush
of
the
tempest
it
was
not
fierce
like
the
lightning
it
was
not
loud
like
the
thunder
but
it
was
a
still
sma
voice
like
a
wee
cricket
in
the
wa
i
regard
the
cricket
that
chirruped
in
the
wall
as
an
institution
one
of
the
past
to
be
sure
swept
away
by
the
current
of
progress
whose
course
is
onward
always
over
everything
obliterating
everything
hurling
the
things
of
today
into
history
or
burying
them
in
eternal
oblivion
in
this
country
there
is
nothing
fixed
nothing
stationary
and
never
has
been
since
the
first
white
man
swung
his
axe
against
the
outside
forest
tree
since
the
first
green
field
was
opened
up
to
the
sunlight
from
the
deep
shadows
of
the
old
forests
that
had
stood
there
grand
solemn
and
boundless
since
this
world
was
first
thrown
from
the
hand
of
god
there
will
be
nothing
fixed
for
centuries
to
come
the
tide
of
progress
will
sweep
onward
in
the
future
as
it
has
done
in
the
past
onward
is
the
great
watchword
of
america
and
american
institutions
onward
and
onward
over
the
ancient
forests
onward
over
the
that
stood
in
the
van
of
civilization
over
the
great
over
the
cricket
in
the
wall
over
the
old
house
dog
that
slept
in
the
corner
over
the
loved
faces
that
clustered
around
the
blazing
hearth
in
the
days

chapter

the
accidents
of
life
some
men
achieve
greatness
and
some
have
greatness
thrust
upon
them
a
slide
rattlesnakes
at
the
top
and
an
icy
pool
at
the
bottom
a
fanciful
theory
while
we
sat
thus
conversing
our
boatmen
went
down
along
the
beach
and
around
a
little
point
that
ran
out
into
the
lake
to
bathe
they
were
jolly
but
uncultivated
men
given
to
rudeness
and
profanity
of
speech
when
out
of
our
immediate
presence
and
by
themselves
and
we
heard
from
them
while
they
were
splashing
and
struggling
in
the
water
expressions
somewhat
inelegant
as
well
as
profane
i
have
often
thought
said
spalding
as
we
listened
to
the
rude
and
sometimes
profane
speech
of
our
men
how
vast
the
influence
which
circumstances
or
accident
over
which
men
have
no
control
have
upon
their
conduct
and
destiny
in
this
world
if
not
in
the
next
the
poet
has
well
said
many
a
gem
of
purest
ray
serene
the
dark
unfathomed
caves
of
ocean
bear
and
many
a
flower
is
born
to
blush
unseen
and
waste
its
sweetness
on
the
desert
air
these
rude
men
are
but
testifying
to
the
great
truth
that
man
is
the
creature
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
of
circumstances
that
he
is
great
or
small
polished
or
rude
wise
or
simple
according
to
the
accident
of
his
birth
or
the
surroundings
in
the
midst
of
which
his
journey
of
life
lays
true
there
intellects
that
will
work
themselves
into
position
men
who
will
hew
their
way
upward
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
which
beset
them
as
there
are
others
who
will
plunge
down
to
degradation
and
dishonor
in
defiance
of
tender
rearing
of
education
of
association
and
all
the
allurements
to
an
upward
career
that
can
be
presented
to
the
human
understanding
but
these
are
so
rare
that
they
may
be
properly
regarded
as
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
so
rare
indeed
as
to
prove
its
truth
you
and
i
can
look
around
us
and
from
among
our
acquaintances
select
many
men
and
women
whose
genius
and
solid
understanding
and
whose
virtues
too
have
remained
undeveloped
and
probably
will
do
so
till
they
die
from
lack
of
opportunity
for
their
exercise
accident
seems
to
have
stricken
them
from
their
legitimate
sphere
circumstances
for
which
they
were
not
responsible
and
over
which
they
could
exercise
no
control
have
barred
them
out
from
their
seeming
true
position
in
the
world
and
the
genius
which
was
intended
for
the
daylight
and
the
eagle
flight
towards
the
sun
is
left
to
skim
in
darkness
along
the
ground
like
the
course
of
the
mousing
owl
we
have
all
seen
another
thing
which
baffles
our
philosophy
while
it
proves
the
truth
of
the
theory
of
which
i
am
speaking
we
have
seen
men
and
see
them
every
day
who
from
no
quality
of
heart
or
mind
seem
fitted
to
rise
in
the
world
occupying
commanding
positions
to
which
accident
has
lifted
them
whose
genius
commands
no
admiration
whose
virtues
are
of
a
doubtful
character
and
who
possess
no
one
quality
which
entitles
them
to
our
respect
or
the
respect
of
the
world
as
the
former
are
the
victims
of
circumstance
these
latter
are
its
creatures
both
are
the
sport
of
fortune
the
one
class
its
victims
and
the
other
its
favorites
how
is
all
this
to
be
accounted
for
and
where
rests
the
responsibility
of
failure
and
where
the
credit
of
success
are
there
accidents
floating
about
among
the
paths
marked
out
on
the
chart
of
life
by
the
deity
which
jostle
his
creatures
from
the
destiny
intended
for
them
or
were
men
thrown
loose
upon
the
currents
of
life
to
take
their
chances
of
good
and
evil
to
be
virtuous
or
vile
according
to
the
influences
among
which
they
were
floating
to
be
fortunate
or
otherwise
as
the
means
of
advancing
themselves
drifted
within
their
reach
if
so
where
rests
the
responsibility
i
ask
again
of
failure
and
where
the
credit
of
success
children
are
born
into
the
world
under
strangely
different
influences
one
first
sees
the
light
in
the
haunts
of
vice
and
crime
amidst
the
corruptions
which
fester
away
down
in
the
depths
of
a
great
city
the
influences
which
surround
it
are
only
and
always
evil
they
are
such
in
infancy
in
childhood
in
youth
and
in
manhood
another
is
cradled
under
the
influence
of
intelligences
piety
virtue
having
around
it
always
the
safeguards
of
refined
and
christian
civilization
what
is
the
difference
in
the
degree
of
responsibility
attached
to
the
future
of
these
antipode
beginnings
can
you
tell
me
where
and
how
these
wide
terribly
wide
distinctions
are
to
be
reconciled
when
and
where
the
career
of
these
germs
of
being
starting
from
points
so
wide
asunder
are
to
meet
and
how
the
balances
of
good
and
evil
of
suffering
and
enjoyment
of
sinning
and
retribution
are
to
be
adjusted
at
last
i
have
been
asking
myself
too
while
listening
to
the
speech
of
these
men
so
thoughtlessly
uttered
where
these
profane
epithets
these
impious
expressions
are
to
rest
at
last
who
can
tell
whether
they
do
not
go
jarring
through
the
universe
marring
the
music
of
the
spheres
throwing
discord
into
the
anthems
of
the
morning
stars
when
they
sing
together
a
wail
among
the
glad
voices
of
the
sons
of
god
when
they
shout
for
joy
in
this
world
and
to
the
dulness
of
human
perception
when
the
sound
of
the
impious
words
has
died
away
or
a
smile
comes
back
to
the
face
clouded
by
the
angry
thought
the
effect
seems
to
have
ceased
but
it
may
not
be
so
the
word
or
the
thought
may
be
wandering
for
ages
vibrating
still
away
off
among
the
outer
creations
of
god
the
angel
that
bore
them
at
the
beginning
from
the
lips
or
the
heart
may
be
flying
still
and
generations
and
centuries
may
have
passed
before
his
journeying
with
them
shall
have
ceased
it
is
a
fanciful
idea
that
whatever
we
say
or
think
is
immortal
that
every
word
we
utter
goes
ringing
through
the
universe
forever
that
every
thought
of
the
heart
becomes
a
creation
a
thing
of
vitality
in
some
shape
starting
forward
among
the
things
of
some
sort
of
life
never
to
die
i
have
sometimes
in
my
dreamy
hours
speculated
upon
the
truth
of
such
a
theory
and
reasoned
with
myself
in
favor
of
its
reality
all
i
can
say
in
its
favor
however
is
that
i
can
not
disprove
it
it
may
be
true
or
it
may
not
there
are
other
mysteries
quite
as
incomprehensible
the
results
of
which
we
can
see
without
being
able
to
penetrate
the
darkness
in
which
they
dwell
but
assuming
its
truth
and
appreciating
the
consequences
which
would
follow
we
should
rule
the
tongue
with
a
sterner
sway
and
guard
the
heart
with
a
more
watchful
care
than
is
our
wont
think
of
the
obscene
word
becoming
a
living
entity
the
profane
oath
a
thing
of
life
the
filthy
or
impure
thought
assuming
form
and
vitality
all
starting
forward
to
exist
forever
among
the
creations
of
infinite
purity
who
would
own
one
of
these
ogres
in
comparison
with
the
beautiful
things
of
god
who
would
say
of
the
obscene
word
the
profane
oath
or
the
filthy
or
impious
thought
is
mine
i
made
it
i
am
the
author
of
its
being
its
creator
and
yet
it
may
be
so
if
it
is
there
are
few
of
us
who
have
not
thrown
into
life
much
very
much
to
mar
the
harmonies
of
nature
to
throw
discord
among
the
spheres
your
statement
remarked
smith
that
accident
has
much
to
do
with
making
or
marring
the
fortunes
of
men
is
doubtless
true
men
are
destroyed
by
accident
and
their
lives
are
sometimes
saved
by
it
and
if
you
put
away
metaphysics
come
out
of
the
cloud
in
which
you
have
hid
yourself
in
your
dreamy
speculations
i
will
furnish
you
with
a
case
in
point
showing
that
a
man
may
get
into
a
very
unpleasant
predicament
where
he
runs
a
great
risk
and
gets
some
hard
knocks
and
yet
be
able
to
thank
god
for
it
in
perfect
earnestness
of
spirit
a
case
of
the
kind
came
under
my
own
observation
and
while
there
was
not
much
philosophy
or
abstract
speculation
about
it
there
was
a
great
deal
of
hard
practical
fact
it
happened
when
i
was
a
boy
at
the
old
homestead
in
the
valley
that
stretches
to
the
southwest
from
the
head
of
crooked
lake
that
valley
is
hemmed
in
by
high
and
steep
hills
and
at
the
tune
of
which
i
speak
was
much
more
beautiful
in
my
view
than
it
is
now
there
was
no
village
there
then
and
the
farms
which
stretched
from
hill
to
hill
were
greatly
less
valuable
than
they
are
now
but
the
woods
and
pastures
and
meadows
lay
exactly
in
the
right
places
and
had
among
them
partridges
and
squirrels
and
pigeons
and
cattle
and
sheep
enough
to
make
things
pleasant
besides
there
were
plenty
of
trout
in
those
days
in
the
stream
that
flows
along
through
the
valley
midway
between
the
hills
on
the
north
side
coming
down
through
a
gorge
or
gulf
as
we
used
to
call
it
was
a
stream
which
in
the
dry
season
of
the
year
was
a
little
brook
trickling
over
the
rocks
but
which
in
the
spring
freshets
or
when
the
clouds
emptied
themselves
on
the
mountain
was
a
wild
foaming
roaring
and
resistless
torrent
in
following
this
stream
into
gulf
you
walked
on
a
level
plain
between
walls
of
rock
rising
two
or
three
hundred
feet
on
either
hand
and
a
dozen
or
more
rods
apart
until
you
came
to
falls
down
which
the
stream
rushed
with
a
plunge
and
a
roar
when
its
back
was
up
or
over
which
in
the
dry
season
it
quietly
rippled
these
were
not
perpendicular
but
steep
as
the
roof
of
a
dutch
barn
and
it
was
a
great
feat
to
climb
them
when
the
stream
was
low
ascending
about
fifty
feet
you
came
to
a
broad
flat
rock
large
and
smooth
as
a
parlor
floor
and
which
in
the
summer
season
was
dry
well
one
day
in
company
with
a
boy
who
was
visiting
me
i
went
up
to
the
and
we
concluded
to
climb
the
shelving
rocks
to
the
and
taking
off
our
shoes
and
stockings
entered
upon
the
perilous
ascent
for
such
to
some
extent
it
was
hands
and
feet
fingers
and
toes
were
all
put
in
requisition
my
friend
began
the
ascent
before
i
did
and
was
half
way
up
when
i
started
i
ought
to
have
said
that
at
the
foot
of
the
was
a
basin
worn
away
by
the
torrent
and
in
which
the
water
clear
and
cold
then
stood
to
the
depth
of
three
or
four
feet
we
were
toiling
painfully
up
when
i
heard
a
rush
above
and
in
an
instant
my
friend
came
like
an
arrow
past
me
sliding
down
the
shelving
rocks
on
his
back
or
rather
in
a
posture
his
rear
to
the
rocks
i
wo
undertake
to
say
that
the
fire
flew
as
he
went
by
me
for
the
rocks
were
slate
and
therefore
such
a
phenomenon
was
not
likely
to
occur
but
the
entire
absence
of
the
seat
of
my
friend
pantaloons
and
the
blood
that
trickled
down
to
his
toes
showed
that
the
friction
was
considerable
as
he
passed
me
i
heard
him
exclaim
god
and
the
next
instant
he
plunged
into
the
cold
water
at
the
base
of
the
falls
what
there
was
to
be
thankful
for
in
such
a
descent
over
the
rocks
i
could
not
at
the
time
comprehend
as
the
chances
were
in
favor
of
a
broken
back
or
neck
or
some
other
consummation
equally
out
of
the
range
of
gratitude
in
an
ordinary
way
he
came
up
out
of
the
water
blowing
and
snorting
like
a
porpoise
with
a
cold
in
his
head
and
waded
to
the
shore
down
he
shouted
which
i
did
not
quite
so
far
or
fast
as
he
did
but
fast
enough
to
make
an
involuntary
plunge
head
foremost
into
the
pool
at
the
bottom
the
occasion
of
his
catastrophe
was
this
he
had
ascended
so
near
the
table
rock
that
his
hands
were
upon
it
and
was
lifting
himself
up
when
as
his
eyes
came
above
the
surface
the
edge
upon
which
his
hands
with
most
of
his
weight
rested
gave
way
and
he
started
for
the
basin
below
but
he
had
a
view
of
what
satisfied
him
that
to
this
accident
he
owed
his
life
and
it
was
a
sense
of
gratitude
for
his
escape
that
prompted
the
exclamation
i
heard
as
he
went
bumping
past
me
coiled
on
the
rock
above
and
within
reach
of
his
face
were
several
large
rattlesnakes
and
he
always
insisted
that
one
made
a
spring
at
him
as
his
hands
gave
way
and
he
put
out
for
the
basin
into
which
he
plunged
he
was
a
good
deal
bruised
but
his
escape
from
the
poisonous
reptiles
reconciled
him
to
that
chapter
xxv
headed
towards
home
the
martin
and
sable
hunter
his
cabin
autumnal
scenery
we
concluded
that
we
would
break
up
our
camp
in
the
morning
and
drift
leisurely
back
towards
civilization
we
had
tarried
upon
this
beautiful
lake
until
we
had
explored
its
romantic
nooks
and
we
started
on
our
return
to
our
old
camping
ground
at
the
foot
of
round
pond
we
had
refrained
for
two
days
from
disturbing
the
deer
and
our
supply
of
fresh
venison
was
entirely
exhausted
just
at
the
outlet
of
the
lake
we
were
leaving
is
a
little
bay
towards
the
head
of
which
are
a
great
number
of
boulders
laying
around
loose
scattered
about
like
haycocks
in
a
meadow
only
a
great
many
more
to
the
acre
the
water
about
these
boulders
is
shallow
and
the
and
grasses
make
a
luxuriant
pasture
for
the
deer
among
these
boulders
and
concealed
by
one
of
them
save
when
his
head
was
up
was
a
deer
while
he
fed
we
could
see
nothing
of
him
but
when
he
raised
his
head
to
look
around
him
that
alone
was
visible
above
the
rock
smith
and
myself
were
in
the
leading
boat
he
in
the
bow
with
his
rifle
as
the
current
swept
near
the
rocks
where
the
deer
was
feeding
we
let
our
little
craft
drift
quietly
in
that
direction
as
we
came
within
shooting
distance
say
from
fifteen
to
twenty
rods
smith
adjusted
his
rifle
and
as
the
animal
raised
its
head
above
the
rock
he
sighted
him
carefully
and
fired
it
was
a
beautiful
shot
there
was
nothing
of
the
animal
but
the
head
visible
and
the
bullet
true
to
its
aim
struck
it
square
between
the
eyes
and
it
fell
dead
this
shot
together
with
the
glory
of
killing
the
bear
elated
smith
wonderfully
and
upon
the
strength
of
them
he
assumed
the
championship
of
the
expedition
we
drew
the
deer
into
the
and
sent
forward
our
pioneer
to
erect
our
tents
and
prepare
a
late
dinner
at
our
old
camping
ground
while
we
landed
with
the
dogs
on
the
island
near
the
head
of
round
pond
or
lake
to
course
whatever
game
they
might
find
upon
it
they
soon
burst
into
full
chorus
and
dashed
away
the
island
is
small
containing
only
a
few
acres
and
the
game
could
not
therefore
take
a
wide
range
after
a
single
turn
a
deer
broke
like
a
maddened
from
the
thicket
and
plunging
into
the
lake
struck
boldly
for
the
mainland
five
hundred
yards
distant
we
were
near
by
with
our
two
boats
when
he
took
to
the
water
and
we
thought
we
would
accompany
him
as
an
escort
to
the
shore
so
we
rowed
up
and
with
a
boat
on
each
side
and
within
ten
feet
of
him
as
he
swam
escorted
him
towards
the
forest
we
treated
him
with
great
respect
offering
him
no
indignity
interfering
with
him
in
nothing
and
yet
the
old
fellow
seemed
very
far
from
appreciating
our
politeness
or
relishing
our
company
the
truth
is
he
was
horribly
frightened
and
he
struggled
desperately
to
rid
himself
of
our
association
but
we
stuck
by
him
like
his
destiny
talking
kindly
to
him
endeavoring
to
impress
upon
his
mind
that
we
meant
him
no
harm
indeed
that
we
were
his
friends
but
i
repeat
he
did
not
appreciate
our
politeness
his
feet
touched
the
sand
and
he
bounded
forward
as
much
as
to
say
gentlemen
when
a
simultaneous
yell
from
all
six
of
us
and
the
discharge
of
four
rifles
in
quick
succession
over
him
added
wonderfully
to
the
energy
of
his
flight
he
will
be
likely
to
recognise
us
if
he
ever
meets
us
again
and
if
the
past
furnishes
any
admonitions
to
his
kind
he
will
give
us
a
wide
berth
we
rowed
leisurely
along
the
eastern
shore
and
in
a
deep
bay
found
excellent
fishing
at
the
mouth
of
a
cold
mountain
brook
on
the
banks
of
this
bay
we
found
the
winter
hut
of
a
martin
and
sable
trapper
it
had
an
outer
and
inner
apartment
the
latter
almost
subterranean
the
hut
was
composed
of
small
logs
which
a
single
man
could
lay
up
the
crevices
between
which
were
closely
packed
with
moss
and
the
roof
covered
with
two
or
three
layers
of
bark
the
doorway
was
sawed
through
these
logs
and
a
door
constructed
of
bark
was
made
to
fit
it
a
rude
hearth
of
sandstone
was
built
in
one
corner
and
a
hole
was
open
above
it
to
let
out
the
smoke
against
the
outside
of
this
pen
only
about
ten
feet
square
logs
were
leaned
up
the
ends
of
which
rested
upon
the
ground
the
interstices
between
them
carefully
stopped
with
moss
and
the
whole
covered
with
bark
the
ends
consisted
of
stakes
driven
into
the
ground
and
chinked
with
moss
into
this
sleeping
apartment
a
door
was
cut
from
the
parlor
large
enough
for
a
man
to
pass
by
getting
down
on
while
within
was
a
plentiful
supply
of
boughs
from
the
spruce
and
fir
tree
in
this
hut
now
so
dark
and
in
which
the
air
was
so
dead
and
fetid
a
solitary
trapper
had
wintered
pursuing
his
occupation
of
martin
and
sable
hunting
the
which
if
tolerably
successful
would
yield
him
some
two
or
three
hundred
dollars
the
season
he
carried
into
the
woods
a
bag
of
flour
or
meal
a
few
pounds
of
pork
pepper
salt
and
tea
and
this
with
the
game
he
killed
made
up
his
supply
of
food
with
no
companion
but
his
dog
he
had
probably
spent
two
or
three
months
and
very
possibly
more
in
this
lonely
cabin
we
arrived
at
our
camp
towards
evening
and
dined
sumptuously
on
fresh
venison
and
trout
our
pioneer
had
provided
a
luxurious
bed
of
boughs
within
and
had
fashioned
rude
seats
in
front
of
our
tents
he
had
rolled
the
butt
of
a
huge
tree
which
he
had
felled
to
the
proper
place
against
which
to
kindle
our
and
we
had
a
pleasant
place
to
sit
with
our
pipes
in
the
evening
looking
out
over
the
water
listening
to
the
half
a
dozen
of
which
were
driving
their
stakes
along
the
reedy
shore
with
commendable
diligence
the
sunlight
lay
so
beautifully
on
the
hillsides
and
contrasted
so
admirably
with
the
deep
shadows
of
the
valley
beneath
the
lake
was
so
calm
and
still
the
old
woods
stood
around
so
moveless
and
solemn
that
one
could
scarcely
persuade
himself
that
he
was
not
looking
upon
some
gigantic
picture
the
fanciful
grouping
and
transcendent
coloring
of
some
ingenious
and
winning
artist
the
hillsides
about
these
lakes
remarked
the
doctor
must
be
superlatively
beautiful
in
the
fall
when
the
forest
puts
on
its
autumnal
foliage
they
present
such
a
variety
of
trees
of
so
many
different
kinds
and
the
hills
and
mountains
are
so
admirably
arranged
that
they
must
be
gorgeous
beyond
description
however
we
may
prefer
the
green
and
beauty
of
spring
when
everything
is
so
full
of
vitality
so
buoyant
and
free
yet
the
autumn
scenery
is
the
most
magnificent
of
any
in
the
year
every
season
has
its
charms
said
spalding
even
the
winter
with
its
cold
its
dead
and
cheerless
desolation
has
its
robe
of
chaste
and
peerless
white
which
as
well
as
that
of
the
the
summer
and
the
autumn
has
been
the
theme
of
song
i
agree
with
you
that
in
gorgeousness
of
beauty
there
is
no
season
so
rich
as
the
autumn
has
its
pleasant
scenery
its
genial
days
its
deep
green
its
flowers
and
its
singing
birds
and
these
are
all
the
more
lovely
because
they
follow
so
closely
upon
the
cold
storms
and
bleak
winds
the
chilling
and
blank
desolation
of
winter
we
love
the
spring
because
of
its
freshness
its
pervading
vitality
its
recuperating
influences
everybody
loves
the
everybody
talks
about
the
poets
sing
of
it
orators
praise
it
women
and
brave
men
laud
it
so
that
were
human
and
possessing
human
instincts
and
subject
to
human
frailties
it
would
have
plenty
of
excuse
for
becoming
a
very
vain
personage
somebody
has
called
the
autumnal
days
the
of
the
year
i
have
forgotten
who
he
was
if
i
ever
knew
but
in
my
judgment
he
was
all
wrong
dark
days
there
are
damp
chilly
misty
wet
and
unpleasant
days
in
autumn
days
that
make
one
relish
a
corner
by
an
fire
there
are
gusty
windy
capricious
days
in
autumn
which
nobody
cares
to
praise
when
the
northwest
wind
goes
sweeping
over
the
forest
roaring
among
the
trees
and
whirling
the
sere
leaves
along
the
ground
and
which
to
tell
the
truth
about
them
are
anything
but
pleasant
but
days
be
dark
and
dreary
and
they
serve
to
give
the
sunlight
of
a
bright
a
keener
relish
and
a
lovelier
comparative
beauty
to
call
the
fall
days
the
of
the
year
is
an
absurdity
poetical
i
admit
but
still
an
absurdity
there
is
nothing
sad
in
a
cold
or
a
wet
a
drizzly
a
gusty
or
a
stormy
day
much
there
may
be
that
is
unpleasant
much
that
one
may
be
disposed
to
quarrel
with
but
they
are
anything
but
sad
a
calm
autumnal
day
in
the
country
is
a
great
thing
a
beautiful
thing
a
thing
to
thank
god
for
a
thing
to
make
one
happy
buoyant
of
spirit
full
of
gratitude
to
the
great
creator
a
thing
to
make
one
merry
too
not
with
a
loud
and
boisterous
mirth
but
with
a
heart
full
to
overflowing
with
cheerfulness
and
a
calm
joy
to
see
the
bright
sun
standing
in
his
glory
up
in
the
sky
shedding
his
placid
light
over
the
earth
when
the
air
is
clear
the
winds
hushed
and
the
leaves
are
still
and
moveless
on
the
trees
and
then
to
look
along
the
hillsides
and
mark
the
bright
sunlight
and
the
deep
shadows
the
green
of
the
fir
the
hemlock
and
the
spruce
the
yellow
of
the
birch
the
crimson
of
the
maple
the
dark
brown
of
the
beech
the
grey
of
the
oak
the
silver
glow
of
the
popple
and
the
varying
shades
of
all
these
mingling
and
blending
in
all
the
harmony
of
brilliant
coloring
why
these
hillsides
are
decked
like
a
maiden
in
her
beauty
like
a
bride
robed
for
the
altar
talk
about
springtime
or
summer
green
on
the
hillside
green
in
the
meadows
and
pastures
green
everywhere
all
around
is
changeless
and
everlasting
green
as
if
hillside
and
valley
forest
and
field
had
but
a
single
dress
for
morning
noon
and
night
and
that
only
and
always
green
true
there
is
the
music
of
the
birds
joyous
notes
and
variant
happy
and
hilarious
in
the
but
there
is
no
cricket
under
the
flat
stone
in
the
pasture
his
song
is
not
heard
in
the
stone
wall
or
in
the
corner
of
the
fences
no
music
of
the
katydid
no
tapping
of
the
woodpecker
on
the
hollow
tree
or
the
dead
limb
no
chattering
of
the
squirrel
as
he
gathers
his
winter
store
no
pattering
of
the
faded
leaves
as
they
come
so
quietly
down
from
their
places
no
falling
of
the
ripened
nuts
loosened
from
their
burs
or
shucks
by
the
recent
frosts
all
these
sounds
belong
to
the
calm
autumnal
days
and
while
they
differ
the
whole
heavens
from
the
merry
songs
of
spring
there
is
nothing
sad
about
them
no
no
nothing
sad
i
remember
and
who
that
was
reared
in
the
country
does
not
when
i
was
a
boy
how
i
went
out
in
the
sunny
days
of
autumn
after
the
frosts
had
painted
the
hillsides
to
gather
chestnuts
and
when
the
breeze
rustled
among
the
branches
how
the
nuts
came
rattling
down
and
how
if
the
winds
were
still
i
climbed
into
the
trees
and
shook
their
tops
and
how
the
chestnuts
pattered
to
the
ground
like
a
shower
of
hail
i
remember
the
squirrels
how
they
chattered
and
chased
each
other
up
and
down
the
trees
or
leaped
from
branch
to
branch
gathering
here
and
there
a
nut
and
scudding
away
to
their
store
houses
in
the
hollow
trees
providing
in
this
season
of
plenty
for
the
barrenness
of
the
winter
months
i
remember
too
how
we
gathered
in
those
same
old
autumnal
days
and
by
the
bushel
and
how
pleasant
it
was
in
the
long
cold
winter
evenings
to
sit
around
the
great
old
kitchen
cracking
the
nuts
we
had
gathered
when
the
green
the
yellow
the
crimson
the
brown
the
grey
and
the
pale
leaves
were
on
the
trees
pleasant
evenings
those
seem
to
me
now
as
they
come
floating
down
on
the
current
of
memory
from
the
long
past
and
dear
are
the
faces
of
those
that
made
up
the
tableaux
as
they
were
grouped
around
those
winter
fires
logs
were
blazing
on
the
great
hearth
and
the
pineknots
thrown
at
intervals
on
the
fire
gave
a
bold
and
cheerful
light
throughout
that
capacious
kitchen
i
remember
how
the
winter
wind
went
glancing
over
the
whirling
and
eddying
and
moaning
around
the
corners
hissing
under
the
door
and
sending
its
cold
breath
in
at
every
crevice
and
how
the
windows
rattled
when
the
blast
came
fiercest
and
how
the
smoke
would
sometimes
whirl
down
the
great
chimney
i
remember
well
where
my
father
chair
was
always
placed
and
where
my
mother
sat
of
those
winter
evenings
when
her
household
cares
were
over
for
the
day
plying
her
needle
or
knitting
or
darning
stockings
or
mending
garments
for
such
employment
was
no
dishonor
to
the
matrons
of
those
days
with
these
for
the
leading
figures
i
remember
how
seven
brothers
and
sisters
were
grouped
around
and
how
the
old
house
dog
had
a
place
in
the
corner
and
how
lovingly
the
cat
nestled
between
his
feet
cherished
memories
are
these
pleasant
visions
and
they
come
to
me
often
vivid
as
realities
but
the
dream
vanishes
the
vision
fades
away
and
i
think
of
the
six
pale
still
faces
as
i
saw
them
last
and
of
the
names
that
are
chiseled
upon
the
cold
marble
that
stands
through
the
sunny
the
heat
of
summer
the
autumnal
days
and
the
storms
and
tempests
of
winter
over
the
graves
of
the
dead

a
surprise
a
serenade
a
visit
from
strangers
an
invitation
to
breakfast
a
fashionable
hour
and
a
bountiful
bill
of
fare
the
evening
was
calm
and
the
lake
slept
in
stirless
beauty
before
us
the
shadows
of
the
mountains
reached
far
out
from
the
shore
lieing
like
a
dark
mantle
upon
the
surface
of
the
waters
above
and
beneath
which
the
stars
twinkled
and
glowed
like
the
bright
eyes
of
seraphs
looking
down
from
the
arches
above
and
up
from
the
depths
below
the
moon
in
her
brightness
sailed
majestically
up
into
the
sky
throwing
her
silver
light
across
the
bosom
of
the
lake
millions
of
fireflies
flashed
their
tiny
torches
along
the
reedy
shore
the
solemn
voices
of
the
night
birds
came
from
out
the
forest
the
call
of
the
raccoon
and
the
answer
the
hooting
of
the
owl
and
the
low
murmur
of
the
leaves
stirred
by
the
light
breeze
that
moved
lazily
among
the
old
familiar
music
to
us
were
heard
this
latter
sound
is
always
heard
even
in
the
stillest
and
calmest
nights
there
may
be
no
ripple
upon
the
water
it
may
be
moveless
and
smooth
as
a
mirror
no
breath
of
air
may
sweep
across
its
surface
and
yet
in
the
old
forest
among
the
there
is
always
that
low
ceaseless
murmur
a
soft
whispering
as
if
the
spirits
of
the
woods
were
holding
in
hushed
voices
communion
together
we
had
retired
for
the
night
under
the
cover
of
our
tents
my
companion
had
sunk
into
slumber
and
i
was
just
in
that
dreamy
state
half
sleeping
and
half
awake
which
constitutes
the
very
paradise
of
repose
when
there
came
drifting
across
the
lake
the
faint
and
far
off
strains
of
music
which
to
my
seeming
exceeded
in
sweetness
anything
i
had
ever
heard
they
came
so
soft
and
melodious
floating
so
gently
over
the
water
and
dying
away
so
quietly
in
the
old
woods
that
i
could
scarce
persuade
myself
of
their
reality
for
a
while
i
lay
luxuriating
as
in
the
delusion
of
a
pleasant
dream
as
though
the
melody
that
was
abroad
on
the
air
was
the
voices
of
angels
chanting
their
lullaby
into
the
charmed
ear
of
the
sleeper
presently
smith
raised
his
head
supporting
his
cheek
upon
his
hand
his
elbow
resting
upon
the
ground
and
after
listening
for
a
moment
opened
his
eyes
in
bewilderment
exclaiming
as
he
looked
in
utter
astonishment
about
him
what
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
mysterious
is
that
spalding
and
the
doctor
followed
and
their
amazement
was
equalled
only
by
their
admiration
when
oft
in
the
stilly
night
came
stealing
in
matchless
harmony
over
the
water
a
serenade
from
the
naiads
by
jupiter
exclaimed
smith
a
concert
by
the
genii
of
the
waters
cried
the
doctor
hush
said
spalding
we
are
trespassing
upon
fairy
domain
the
spirits
of
these
old
woods
these
mountains
and
lakes
are
abroad
and
well
may
they
carol
in
their
joyousness
in
a
night
like
this
in
a
little
while
the
music
changed
and
come
the
moonlight
sea
came
swelling
over
the
lake
and
again
it
changed
and
come
mariner
down
in
the
deep
with
me
went
gently
and
swiftly
abroad
on
the
air
the
music
ceased
for
a
moment
and
then
two
manly
voices
of
great
depth
and
power
came
floating
to
our
ears
to
the
words
farewell
to
thee
araby
daughter

ever
lay
under
onan
dark
water
more
pure
in
its
shell
than
thy
spirit
in
thee
that
flesh
and
blood
at
least
exclaimed
the
doctor
and
i
propose
to
ascertain
who
are
treating
as
to
this
charming
serenade
in
the
stillness
of
midnight
we
went
down
to
the
margin
of
the
lake
and
a
few
rods
from
the
shore
lay
a
little
craft
like
our
own
in
which
were
seated
two
gentlemen
the
one
with
a
flute
and
the
other
with
a
violin
they
had
seen
our
campfire
from
their
shanty
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
and
had
crossed
over
to
surprise
us
with
the
melody
of
human
music
and
pleasantly
indeed
it
sounded
in
the
stillness
and
repose
of
that
summer
night
in
that
wild
region
the
echoes
that
dwell
among
those
old
forests
those
hills
and
beautiful
lakes
had
never
been
startled
from
their
slumbers
by
such
sounds
before
and
right
merrily
they
carried
them
from
hill
to
hill
and
through
the
old
woods
and
over
the
calm
surface
of
that
sleeping
lake
and
with
a
joyousness
too
that
told
how
welcome
they
were
among
those
wild
and
primeval
things
after
listening
to
their
music
for
half
an
hour
we
invited
our
new
friends
ashore
we
found
them
to
be
two
young
gentlemen
from
philadelphia
who
had
just
graduated
at
one
of
the
eastern
colleges
and
who
had
concluded
to
spend
a
month
among
these
mountains
and
lakes
before
entering
upon
the
study
of
the
profession
to
which
they
were
to
devote
themselves
they
had
been
close
friends
from
their
childhood
and
during
their
collegiate
course
they
had
cultivated
their
taste
for
music
until
few
mere
amateurs
could
equal
their
skill
upon
their
respective
instruments
or
in
harmony
of
voice
they
were
highly
intelligent
and
courteous
gentlemen
and
if
their
future
shall
equal
the
promise
of
the
present
they
will
make
their
mark
in
the
world
we
accepted
at
parting
their
invitation
to
breakfast
with
them
on
the
morrow
and
at
one
they
left
us
to
return
to
their
shanty
over
the
lake
we
sent
one
of
our
boatmen
to
row
them
home
and
as
they
started
across
the
water
they
treated
us
to
a
concert
to
which
it
was
pleasant
to
listen
there
is
something
surpassingly
sweet
in
the
music
of
the
flute
and
violin
in
the
hands
of
skillful
performers
and
yet
to
my
thinking
it
falls
far
short
of
the
melody
of
the
human
voice
i
have
listened
to
some
of
the
most
celebrated
singers
and
of
the
most
distinguished
performers
but
it
appears
to
me
now
that
i
never
on
any
other
occasion
heard
the
melody
of
the
human
voice
or
instrumental
music
half
so
enchanting
as
that
which
came
floating
over
the
lake
on
that
calm
summer
night
there
was
a
volume
and
compass
about
it
which
can
never
be
reached
in
a
concert
room
it
was
not
loud
but
it
seemed
to
fill
all
the
air
with
its
sweetness
it
came
over
the
senses
like
a
pleasant
dream
as
it
went
swelling
up
to
the
hills
that
skirted
the
lake
floating
away
over
the
water
and
dying
away
in
lengthened
cadence
in
the
old
forests
every
other
sound
was
hushed
the
voices
of
the
were
stilled
even
the
frogs
along
the
shore
suspended
their
bellowing
and
all
nature
seemed
listening
to
the
new
harmony
that
thus
fell
like
enchantment
upon
the
repose
of
midnight
the
music
grew
fainter
and
fainter
as
it
receded
until
only
an
occasional
strain
wavy
and
came
creeping
like
the
voice
of
a
spirit
over
the
water
and
then
it
was
lost
in
the
distance
the
frogs
resumed
their
roaring
the
lifted
up
their
voices
the
raccoon
called
to
his
fellow
and
was
answered
away
off
in
the
forest
the
hammered
away
at
his
stake
the
old
owl
hooted
solemnly
from
his
perch
and
we
retired
to
our
tents
to
talk
over
the
romance
of
our
serenade
and
to
dream
of
ole
bull
and
the
swedish
nightingale
the
morning
broke
bright
and
balmy
a
pleasant
breeze
swept
lazily
over
the
lake
lifting
the
thin
mist
that
hung
like
a
veil
of
gauze
above
the
water
we
left
our
tents
standing
and
crossed
over
to
the
shanty
of
our
friends
of
the
previous
evening
to
breakfast
we
found
them
living
like
princes
their
two
boatmen
had
built
them
a
log
shanty
open
in
front
and
covered
with
bark
so
as
to
be
impervious
to
the
rain
while
within
was
a
luxurious
bed
of
boughs
around
the
campfire
were
benches
of
hewn
slabs
and
a
table
of
the
same
material
a
few
rods
from
the
door
a
beautiful
spring
came
bubbling
up
into
a
little
basin
of
pure
white
sand
the
water
of
which
was
limpid
and
cold
almost
as
they
had
been
here
for
a
week
hunting
and
fishing
they
had
employed
their
leisure
in
jerking
the
venison
they
had
taken
of
which
they
had
some
four
or
five
bushels
and
which
they
intended
to
take
home
with
them
to
serve
together
with
the
skins
of
the
deer
they
had
slain
as
trophies
of
their
success
they
received
us
cordially
and
we
sat
down
to
a
breakfast
which
for
variety
at
least
rivalled
the
elaborate
preparations
of
the
astor
or
the
nicholas
albeit
the
cookery
as
an
abstract
fact
might
have
been
of
the
simplest
we
had
pork
ham
jerked
venison
stew
fresh
trout
broiled
partridge
cold
roast
duck
a
fricassee
of
wood
rabbits
and
broiled
pigeon
upon
our
table
coming
in
courses
or
piled
up
on
great
platters
of
birch
bark
some
on
tin
plates
and
now
and
then
a
choice
bit
on
a
chip
we
had
coffee
and
tea
and
the
purest
of
spring
water
by
way
of
beverage
and
truth
compels
me
to
admit
that
under
the
advice
of
the
doctor
a
drop
or
two
of
old
cognac
may
have
been
added
by
way
of
relish
or
to
temper
the
effect
of
a
hearty
meal
upon
the
delicate
stomachs
of
some
of
the
guests
we
were
exceedingly
fashionable
in
our
time
for
breakfasting
this
morning
and
it
was
eleven
before
we
rose
from
table
the
sun
was
travelling
through
a
cloudless
sky
and
his
brightness
lay
like
a
mantle
of
glory
upon
the
water
while
his
heat
gave
to
the
deep
shadows
of
the
old
trees
whose
long
arms
with
their
clustering
foliage
were
interlocked
above
us
a
peculiar
charm
the
description
which
we
gave
of
the
beautiful
lake
we
had
left
the
day
before
the
story
of
the
moose
and
the
bear
we
had
killed
together
with
our
of
the
shanty
we
had
inhabited
brought
our
friends
to
the
conclusion
to
drift
that
way
for
a
week
or
so
it
was
amusing
to
hear
smith
relate
the
manner
of
capturing
the
bear
the
glory
of
which
achievement
he
had
won
by
the
tossing
up
of
a
dollar
how
he
had
started
out
alone
in
one
of
the
boats
with
his
rifle
to
look
into
a
little
bay
half
a
mile
below
the
shanty
where
be
left
the
rest
of
us
sleeping
after
dinner
and
how
as
he
was
floating
along
under
the
shadow
of
the
hills
at
the
base
of
a
wall
of
rocks
some
forty
feet
high
rising
straight
up
from
the
water
he
heard
something
walking
just
over
the
precipice
and
how
he
picked
up
his
rifle
that
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
to
be
ready
for
any
emergency
and
then
how
astonished
he
was
to
see
a
great
black
bear
walk
out
into
view
along
the
edge
of
the
rocks
above
and
how
carefully
he
sighted
him
and
how
at
the
crack
of
his
rifle
the
animal
came
tumbling
down
the
cliff
and
how
quick
he
reloaded
and
gave
trim
a
settler
in
the
shape
of
a
second
bullet
and
how
he
tugged
and
strained
and
lifted
to
get
him
into
the
boat
and
how
astonished
we
all
were
when
he
returned
with
his
prize
to
camp
while
relating
this
wonderful
achievement
he
winked
at
the
doctor
as
much
as
to
say
fair
play
remember
our
compact
stand
by
me
now
and
the
doctor
did
stand
by
him
boldly
endorsing
with
a
gravity
that
was
refreshing
every
invention
of
smith
prolific
imagination
on
the
subject
of
his
slaughtering
the
bear
we
left
our
new
friends
in
the
afternoon
they
to
start
in
the
morning
for
our
old
on
the
lake
above
and
we
down
the
stream
on
our
retreat
from
the
wilderness
we
came
back
to
our
tents
after
securing
a
string
of
trout
from
the
mouth
of
the
little
stream
across
the
bay
our
evening
meal
was
over
and
we
sat
around
our
campfire
just
as
the
sun
was
hiding
himself
behind
the
western
highlands
when
from
a
little
hollow
in
the
forest
behind
us
and
but
a
short
way
off
we
heard
the
call
of
a
raccoon
martin
started
over
the
ridge
with
the
dogs
and
in
five
minutes
he
hallooed
to
us
to
come
with
our
rifles
for
he
had
the
animal
treed
and
ready
to
be
brought
down
at
a
moment
warning
we
went
over
to
where
he
was
and
sure
enough
away
up
in
the
top
of
a
tall
birch
sat
his
coonship
looking
quietly
down
upon
the
dogs
that
were
baying
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
gentlemen
said
spalding
we
will
not
all
fire
at
this
animal
as
we
did
at
smith
bear
one
bullet
is
enough
for
him
and
if
he
gets
down
among
us
i
think
six
men
will
be
a
match
for
one
so
we
need
not
be
inhuman
through
a
sense
of
danger
whose
shot
shall
he
be
i
move
that
spalding
have
the
first
shot
said
smith
and
the
motion
was
carried
do
i
understand
you
gentlemen
spalding
inquired
adjusting
himself
as
if
preparing
to
bring
down
the
game
that
i
am
to
have
this
first
shot
and
that
no
one
is
to
fire
until
i
have
taken
a
fair
shot
at
him
we
all
answered
yes
are
you
perfectly
agreed
in
this
and
do
you
all
pledge
yourselves
to
abide
the
compact
spalding
inquired
again
bringing
his
rifle
to
a
present
and
looking
up
at
the
game
all
agreed
we
answered
with
one
voice
very
well
gentlemen
said
spalding
shouldering
his
rifle
one
life
saved
anyhow
that
animal
up
there
has
been
in
great
peril
but
he
safe
now
i
do
intend
to
fire
at
him
sooner
than
ten
and
if
i
understand
our
arrangements
we
leave
here
in
the
morning
at
six
sold
by
moses
exclaimed
martin
as
he
broke
out
into
a
roar
that
you
might
have
heard
a
mile
i
thought
the
judge
meant
something
by
the
time
he
wasted
in
talkin
and
gettin
ready
to
shoot
spalding
inquired
smith
do
you
expect
us
to
keep
this
compact
of
course
i
do
he
replied
did
any
of
us
peach
when
you
opened
so
rich
in
the
matter
of
your
bear
did
any
one
break
his
compact
with
you
on
that
subject
absolve
us
from
our
agreement
about
the
bear
and
you
may
take
my
shot
at
that
animal
up
in
the
tree
i
was
born
yesterday
smith
replied
and
i
ca
afford
to
exchange
the
glory
of
killing
the
bear
in
my
own
way
and
baring
three
responsible
endorsers
for
the
honor
of
shooting
a
coon
gentlemen
he
continued
i
move
that
that
coon
be
permitted
to
take
his
own
time
to
descend
from
his
perch
up
in
the
there
and
the
motion
was
carried
unanimously
chapter
xxvii
would
i
were
a
boy
again
we
have
played
the
boy
again
yesterday
and
pretty
well
remarked
smith
as
we
sat
in
front
of
oar
tents
in
the
evening
smoking
our
pipes
and
i
am
half
inclined
to
think
we
have
started
for
home
too
soon
after
all
spalding
moralizing
for
the
last
two
or
three
days
deceived
me
i
thought
as
he
was
becoming
so
serious
he
must
be
getting
tired
of
the
woods
but
his
proposition
yesterday
to
escort
that
deer
to
the
shore
and
frighten
him
almost
to
death
his
jolly
humor
with
our
young
friends
over
the
way
and
the
trick
he
played
on
as
in
regard
to
the
raccoon
this
evening
satisfies
me
that
he
got
a
good
deal
of
the
boy
in
him
yet
we
shall
have
to
retreat
from
the
woods
slower
than
i
thought
to
exhaust
it
if
the
cares
of
business
or
the
duties
of
life
did
not
call
us
back
to
civilization
said
the
doctor
i
could
almost
spend
the
summer
among
these
lakes
only
for
the
luxury
of
feeling
like
a
boy
again
when
i
listen
to
the
glad
voices
of
the
wild
things
around
as
i
can
almost
wish
myself
one
of
them
that
coon
for
instance
interrupted
smith
that
came
so
near
getting
shot
by
his
chattering
i
call
the
gentleman
to
order
said
i
the
doctor
has
the
floor
i
sometimes
think
that
it
is
no
great
thing
after
all
to
be
human
the
doctor
continued
bowing
his
acknowledgments
for
my
protecting
his
right
to
the
floor
mind
is
a
great
thing
but
there
is
more
of
sorrow
anxiety
and
care
clustering
about
it
than
these
wild
things
we
hear
and
see
around
us
suffer
through
their
instincts
reason
knowledge
wisdom
are
great
things
to
stand
at
the
head
of
created
matter
to
be
the
noblest
of
all
the
works
of
god
the
only
created
thing
wearing
the
image
and
stamped
with
the
patent
of
diety
are
proud
things
to
boast
of
but
great
and
glorious
and
proud
as
they
are
they
have
their
balances
of
evil
they
bring
with
them
no
contentment
no
repose
while
they
heap
upon
us
boundless
necessities
and
limitless
wants
we
are
hurried
through
life
too
rapidly
for
the
enjoyment
of
the
present
and
the
good
we
see
in
prospect
is
never
attained
when
we
were
boys
we
longed
to
be
men
with
the
strength
and
intellect
of
men
and
now
that
we
are
men
with
matured
powers
of
body
and
mind
true
to
our
organic
restlessness
and
discontent
we
look
back
with
longing
for
the
feelings
and
emotions
of
our
boyhood
what
a
glorious
thing
it
would
be
if
we
could
always
be
young
not
boys
exactly
but
at
that
stage
of
life
when
the
physical
powers
are
most
active
and
the
heart
most
buoyant
that
to
my
thinking
would
be
a
better
arrangement
than
to
grow
old
even
if
we
live
on
until
we
stumble
at
last
from
mere
infirmity
into
the
grave
looking
forward
in
discontent
one
half
of
our
lives
and
backward
in
equal
discontent
the
other
you
remind
me
said
spalding
of
a
little
incident
simple
in
itself
but
which
at
the
time
made
a
deep
impression
upon
my
mind
and
which
occurred
but
a
few
weeks
ago
returning
from
my
usual
walk
one
morning
my
way
lay
through
the
capitol
park
the
trees
covered
with
their
young
and
fresh
foliage
intertwined
their
arms
lovingly
above
the
gravelled
walks
forming
a
beautiful
arch
above
through
which
the
sun
could
scarcely
look
even
in
the
splendor
of
his
noon
the
birds
sang
merrily
among
the
branches
and
the
odor
of
the
leaves
and
grass
as
the
dews
exhaled
gave
a
freshness
almost
of
the
forest
to
the
morning
air
on
the
walk
before
me
were
two
beautiful
children
a
boy
of
six
and
a
little
girl
of
four
they
were
merry
and
happy
as
the
birds
were
and
with
an
arm
of
each
around
the
waist
of
the
other
they
went
hopping
and
skipping
up
and
down
the
walks
stopping
now
and
then
to
waltz
to
swing
round
and
round
and
then
darting
away
again
with
their
hop
and
skip
too
full
of
hilarity
too
instinct
with
vitality
to
be
for
a
moment
still
the
flush
of
health
was
on
their
cheeks
and
the
warm
light
of
affection
in
their
eyes
they
were
confiding
affectionate
loving
little
children
and
my
heart
warmed
towards
them
as
i
saw
them
waltzing
and
dancing
and
skipping
about
under
the
green
foliage
of
the
trees
said
the
little
girl
as
they
sat
down
on
the
low
railing
of
the
grass
plats
to
breathe
for
a
moment
and
listen
to
the
chirrup
and
songs
of
the
birds
in
the
boughs
above
them
would
you
like
to
be
a
little
bird
little
bird
lizzie
replied
her
brother
should
i
like
to
be
a
little
bird
to
fly
around
among
the
branches
and
the
leaves
upon
the
trees
said
lizzie
among
the
blossoms
when
the
morning
is
warm
and
the
sun
comes
out
bright
and
clear
in
the
sky
oh
they
are
so
happy
the
mornings
aint
always
warm
and
the
sun
do
always
come
up
bright
and
clear
in
the
sky
lizzy
said
her
brother
the
leaves
and
blossoms
aint
always
on
the
trees
the
cold
storms
and
the
winter
come
and
kill
the
blossoms
and
scatter
the
leaves
and
what
would
you
do
then
i
should
like
to
be
a
bird
but
i
like
to
be
a
big
strong
man
like
father
tell
me
what
tune
it
is
said
the
little
boy
addressing
me
i
told
him
and
he
turned
to
his
little
sister
saving
lizzie
we
must
go
mother
said
we
must
be
home
by
seven
and
it
most
that
now
and
he
put
his
arm
lovingly
around
her
neck
and
she
put
hers
around
his
waist
and
they
walked
away
towards
home
talking
about
the
leaves
and
the
blossoms
on
the
trees
the
merry
little
birds
the
bright
sunshine
and
the
pleasant
time
they
had
had
in
the
park
that
morning
it
was
a
pleasant
thing
to
see
those
two
little
children
so
confiding
so
earnest
and
true
in
their
young
affections
clinging
to
each
other
so
closely
as
if
no
shadow
could
ever
come
between
them
or
tarn
their
hearts
from
each
other
how
natural
was
that
simple
question
put
by
that
little
girl
to
her
brother
you
like
to
be
a
little
bird
it
was
the
thought
of
a
pure
young
mind
that
sees
only
the
bright
sunshine
of
whose
life
is
in
the
present
and
to
which
there
is
no
forebodings
of
darkness
in
the
future
there
was
philosophy
too
in
the
answer
of
her
brother
a
simple
but
suggestive
sermon
the
sun
said
he
always
come
up
bright
and
clear
the
mornings
aint
always
warm
the
leaves
and
blossoms
aint
always
on
the
trees
the
cold
storms
and
the
winter
come
and
kill
the
blossoms
and
scatter
the
leaves
and
what
would
you
do
then
to
finite
minds
like
ours
it
would
seem
to
have
been
a
more
beautiful
arrangement
of
nature
could
it
have
been
that
we
could
always
have
the
spring
time
in
its
glory
with
us
if
the
leaves
and
the
blossoms
were
always
young
and
fresh
and
fragrant
if
the
cold
storms
of
winter
could
never
come
to
the
blossoms
and
scatter
the
leaves
if
the
sun
would
always
come
up
bright
and
clear
if
the
birds
were
always
merry
and
their
glad
voices
always
on
the
air
this
world
would
be
a
paradise
then
and
one
older
and
wiser
in
the
learning
of
the
schools
but
not
wiser
or
better
in
the
heart
affections
than
that
little
girl
might
well
wish
to
be
a
little
bird
to
fly
around
among
the
branches
the
green
leaves
and
the
blossoms
on
the
trees
and
yet
what
presumption
in
finite
man
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
or
criticise
the
wisdom
of
the
omnipotent
god
how
know
we
but
that
a
single
change
the
slightest
alteration
of
a
simple
law
would
go
jarring
through
all
the
universe
throwing
everything
into
confusion
and
bringing
utter
chaos
where
now
all
is
order
the
mother
sees
her
little
child
die
she
lays
it
in
its
coffin
and
surrenders
it
to
the
grave
and
her
heart
rebels
against
the
providence
that
snatched
away
her
treasure
in
her
agony
she
appeals
reproachfully
to
heaven
and
asks
am
i
thus
bereaved
foolish
mother
impeach
not
the
wisdom
of
your
bereavement
mysterious
as
it
may
be
know
this
that
in
the
councils
of
eternity
your
sorrows
were
considered
and
the
decree
which
took
from
you
your
darling
was
ordered
in
mercy
pestilence
sweeps
over
the
land
a
wail
is
on
the
air
peace
mourners
be
still
the
pestilence
has
a
mission
of
mercy
mysterious
as
it
may
be
to
us
the
storm
lashes
the
ocean
into
fury
tall
ships
freighted
with
human
souls
go
down
into
its
relentless
depths
a
shriek
of
agony
comes
gurgling
up
from
the
devouring
waters
a
cry
of
woe
is
heard
from
a
thousand
homes
over
the
wrecked
and
the
lost
peace
again
mourners
the
storm
has
a
mission
of
mercy
it
may
never
be
comprehended
by
us
here
but
when
the
veil
shall
be
lifted
as
in
god
good
time
it
doubtless
will
be
we
shall
see
how
the
pestilence
and
the
storm
that
cost
so
many
tears
were
essential
to
the
harmony
of
a
glorious
system
a
perfect
plan
and
that
seeming
sorrow
was
at
last
the
occasion
of
unspeakable
joy
let
no
man
say
that
this
or
that
law
or
operation
of
nature
were
better
changed
until
he
can
fathom
the
designs
of
god
till
he
can
create
a
planet
and
send
it
on
its
everlasting
round
till
he
can
place
a
star
in
the
firmament
till
he
can
breathe
upon
a
statue
the
workmanship
of
his
own
hands
and
be
obeyed
when
he
commands
it
to
walk
forth
a
thing
of
life
till
he
can
dip
his
hand
into
chaos
and
throw
off
worlds
the
storms
of
winter
are
essential
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
brightness
and
glory
the
genial
sunshine
the
pleasant
foliage
the
blossoms
and
the
odors
of
spring
they
have
their
uses
and
chill
and
dreary
and
desolate
as
they
may
be
they
are
parts
of
an
arrangement

by
infinite
goodness
and
omnipotent
wisdom

strong
man
like
father
is
how
like
a
boy
was
this
thirsting
for
the
strength
the
might
and
power
of
manhood
and
this
is
the
aspiration
of
the
young
heart
always
to
be
mature
strong
to
grapple
with
the
cares
and
wrestle
with
the
stern
actualities
of
life
how
little
of
these
does
childhood
know
how
little
does
it
calculate
the
chances
that
when
in
the
long
future
it
shall
have
attained
the
full
strength
and
maturity
of
life
when
manhood
shall
be
in
the
glory
and
strength
of
its
prime
and
it
looks
forward
into
the
dark
cloud
beyond
and
backward
into
the
bright
sunshine
of
the
past
the
aspiration
the
hope
will
change
into
regret
and
the
yearning
of
the

its
silent
depths

boy
again
chapter
xxviii
headed
down
stream
return
to
tupper
lake
the
camp
on
the
island
we
started
down
stream
again
at
six
in
the
morning
intending
if
possible
to
reach
tupper
lake
before
encamping
for
the
night
it
would
make
for
us
a
busy
day
to
accomplish
so
much
but
going
down
stream
and
down
hill
are
very
different
things
from
going
up
as
any
gentleman
may
satisfy
himself
by
rowing
against
a
current
of
two
miles
the
hour
or
toiling
up
an
ascent
of
three
or
four
hundred
feet
to
the
mile
and
then
retracing
his
steps
we
accomplished
more
than
half
the
distance
and
that
over
the
worst
of
the
journey
by
twelve
and
we
halted
for
dinner
and
a
if
there
is
one
thing
in
life
which
can
lay
any
claim
to
being
considered
a
positive
luxury
it
is
a
nap
on
a
mossy
bank
in
the
deep
shadows
of
the
forest
trees
after
a
hearty
meal
of
a
warm
summer
day
there
should
be
in
order
to
its
full
appreciation
a
mixture
of
weariness
with
a
due
proportion
of
laziness
too
much
of
either
detracts
from
the
enjoyment
of
its
beatitudes
to
the
sensation
of
resting
that
weariness
is
leaving
you
and
that
the
process
of
recuperation
is
an
active
living
agency
going
on
all
through
the
system
while
the
natural
love
of
repose
is
being
gratified
as
an
independent
emotion
constitute
the
very
perfection
of
mere
animal
enjoyment
the
musquitoes
at
midday
have
gone
to
their
rest
or
if
a
straggler
comes
buzzing
and
singing
about
your
ears
you
are
lulled
rather
than
disturbed
by
his
song
if
he
takes
his
drop
of
blood
from
your
veins
the
tickling
of
his
tiny
lance
is
but
a
pleasant
titilation
and
you
let
him
feed
on
almost
grateful
for
his
kindness
in
keeping
you
from
sleeping
too
soundly
or
losing
in
utter
oblivion
the
full
extent
of
the
luxury
of
perfect
repose
after
an
hour
rest
we
launched
our
little
fleet
upon
the
river
again
and
while
the
sun
was
yet
above
the
western
highlands
we
stood
upon
the
broad
flat
rock
at
the
mouth
of
bog
river
looking
out
over
tupper
lake
one
of
the
most
beautiful
sheets
of
water
that
the
sun
or
the
stars
ever
looked
upon
our
was
getting
low
and
our
egress
from
the
wilderness
was
therefore
becoming
in
some
sort
a
necessity
there
was
no
lack
of
venison
or
fish
but
these
are
rather
luxuries
than
actual
necessaries
and
they
were
becoming
somewhat
stale
to
as
the
staff
of
life
is
bread
and
of
this
we
had
but
two
days
supply
it
is
entirely
true
that
our
jerked
venison
now
dry
and
hard
as
chips
could
if
necessary
be
made
to
furnish
to
some
extent
a
substitute
still
while
it
is
written
that
man
shall
not
live
by
bread
alone
it
is
equally
the
law
that
he
can
not
very
well
get
along
without
it
we
launched
our
boats
upon
the
lake
and
rowed
to
the
head
of
long
island
where
we
put
up
our
tents
for
the
night
i
have
spoken
so
often
of
the
loveliness
of
the
evenings
on
these
beautiful
lakes
that
to
attempt
a
description
of
the
one
we
enjoyed
on
this
romantic
island
would
be
only
a
tiresome
repetition
but
there
was
a
splendor
about
the
heavens
above
and
their
counterpart
in
the
depths
below
which
i
have
scarcely
ever
seen
equalled
there
was
no
moon
in
the
early
evening
and
so
pure
and
clear
was
the
atmosphere
so
moveless
and
still
the
waters
that
the
stars
seemed
to
come
out
in
vaster
numbers
and
with
an
intenser
glow
and
to
be
reflected
back
from
away
down
in
the
lake
with
a
brighter
refulgence
the
hills
along
the
shore
seemed
to
stand
up
in
bolder
outline
the
bays
to
lay
in
deeper
shadow
while
the
tall
peaks
stood
in
grim
solemnity
like
pillars
supporting
the
mighty
arches
of
the
sky
i
was
asking
myself
said
smith
as
we
sat
looking
out
over
the
water
in
the
evening
or
gazing
down
into
the
glowing
depths
and
listening
to
the
night
voices
faint
and
far
off
in
the
old
forests
as
they
came
floating
over
the
lake
i
was
asking
myself
as
we
journeyed
around
the
falls
and
as
we
stood
on
the
rock
where
the
river
comes
leaping
down
and
plunging
into
the
lake
whether
the
march
of
improvement
would
ever
spread
a
lowell
around
those
falls
or
subject
those
wild
waters
to
the
uses
of
civilization
whether
progress
would
ever
invade
those
mountain
regions
or
the
ingenuity
of
man
ever
discover
uses
for
these
rocks
and
boulders
or
coin
wealth
from
the
sterile
and
sandy
soil
of
this
old
wilderness
hitherto
a
country
like
this
has
been
regarded
of
no
value
save
for
the
timber
which
it
grows
and
when
that
is
exhausted
as
fit
only
to
be
abandoned
to
sterility
and
desolation
but
who
can
tell
whether
there
may
not
be
in
these
boulders
these
rocks
this
sandy
and
unproductive
soil
unknown
wealth
held
in
reserve
to
reward
the
researches
of
science
in
its
utilitarian
explorations
i
am
not
now
speaking
of
gold
or
silver
or
any
other
dross
which
men
have
hitherto
wasted
their
toil
to
accumulate
but
of
new
discoveries
and
new
purposes
to
which
these
now
useless
things
may
be
applied
discoveries
which
may
send
the
tide
of
emigration
surging
up
from
the
valleys
to
mountain
regions
like
these
may
it
not
be
that
science
while
delving
among
the
wrecks
of
vanished
ages
may
stumble
upon
some
new
principle
or
combination
of
the
elements
of
which
these
old
rocks
are
composed
that
shall
give
them
a
value
beyond
that
of
the
richest
lowlands
and
make
them
the
centre
of
a
dense
and
cultivated
population
your
question
answered
spalding
is
suggestive
did
you
ever
think
what
gigantic
strides
the
world
has
made
within
the
memory
of
men
now
living
and
who
are
yet
unwilling
to
be
counted
as
old
look
back
for
only
fifty
years
and
note
what
a
stupendous
leap
it
has
taken
where
then
were
the
iron
roads
over
which
the
locomotive
goes
thundering
on
its
mission
of
civilization
where
the
telegraph
that
mocks
at
time
and
annihilates
space
hark
there
is
a
new
sound
breaking
the
stillness
of
midnight
and
startling
the
mountain
echoes
from
their
sleep
of
ages
it
is
the
scream
of
the
the
snort
of
the
iron
horse
the
thunder
of
his
hoofs
of
steel
rushing
forward
with
the
speed
of
the
wind
shaking
the
ground
like
an
earthquake
as
he
moves
a
new
motor
has
been
harnessed
into
the
service
of
man
and
made
to
fly
with
his
messages
swifter
than
sound
it
is
the
winged
lightning
and
as
it
flashes
along
the
wires
stretched
from
city
to
city
and
across
continents
carries
with
unerring
certainty
every
word
committed
to
its
charge
ocean
steamers
have
made
but
a
ferriage
of
seas
the
photographic
art
has
made
even
the
light
of
the
sun
a
substitute
for
the
pencil
of
the
artist
everywhere
in
all
the
departments
of
science
in
every
branch
of
the
arts
improvement
progress
has
been
going
on
with
a
sublimity
of
achievement
unknown
in
any
age
of
the
past
these
things
are
mighty
motors
which
push
along
civilization
throwing
a
wonderful
energy
into
the
forward
impulse
of
the
world
but
remember
that
though
these
results
are
brought
about
by
the
advance
in
the
mechanic
arts
yet
that
advance
is
based
upon
a
deeper
philosophy
a
profounder
wisdom
than
mere
perfectability
in
those
arts
take
the
it
is
a
great
contrivance
a
wonderful
invention
but
the
greatest
of
all
was
the
discovery
of
the
principle
and
operation
the
practical
phenomena
of
steam
itself
the
telegraphic
machine
was
a
great
invention
but
the
great
thing
was
the
development
of
the
science
of
electricity
the
discovery
of
the
secret
agency
which
sent
forward
the
thought
entrusted
to
it
swifter
than
light
the
daguerrian
instruments
the
metallic
plates
the
prepared
paper
were
great
inventions
but
vastly
greater
was
the
discovery
and
development
of
the
phenomena
and
affinities
of
light
the
mystery
of
solar
influences
there
is
hope
for
the
world
in
all
this
mighty
progress
for
with
it
will
one
day
come
the
development
of
the
true
nature
and
theory
of
government
the
true
solution
of
the
great
theory
of
the
social
compact
the
proper
adjustment
of
the
relations
of
man
to
man
a
right
appreciation
of
the
nature
and
value
of
human
rights
it
is
bringing
forward
the
masses
elevating
the
millions
who
work
it
will
rouse
into
activity
their
innate
energies
and
bring
forth
their
inward
might
it
creates
thought
to
guide
the
hands
that
set
all
this
vast
machinery
in
motion
it
diffuses
and
strengthens
intellectuality
and
the
pride
of
intellectuality
making
of
the
men
who
work
something
more
than
mere
machines
themselves
it
is
developing
and
perfecting
a
mightier
engine
than
any
of
man
invention
one
that
tyrants
can
not
always
control
that
kings
can
not
always
manage
that
engine
is
the
human
mind
like
the
it
is
gathering
power
and
capability
for
the
exercise
of
power
and
the
time
will
come
when
it
will
go
crashing
with
resistless
energy
among
thrones
overturning
despotisms
upheaving
dynasties
sweeping
away
those
false
theories
of
governmental
institutions
which
guarantee
to
one
class
of
people
a
life
of
luxurious
idleness
coupled
with
a
prerogative
to
rule
and
which
dooms
another
class
to
an
hereditary
servitude
changeless
as
fate
and
relentless
as
the
grave
it
will
vindicate
the
rights
and
ennoble
the
destiny
of
the
masses
of
the
people
who
work
but
where
is
this
career
of
progress
to
end
is
there
a
limit
to
this
onward
movement
we
know
that
the
world
has
made
greater
advancement
in
the
present
century
than
it
did
in
the
five
thousand
years
preceding
it
and
that
new
discoveries
in
the
sciences
and
the
arts
are
being
made
every
day
nature
has
been
compelled
and
is
still
being
compelled
to
yield
up
secrets
which
have
been
for
centuries
regarded
as
beyond
the
power
of
human
capacity
to
penetrate
how
is
this
is
the
world
to
go
on
thus
always
is
this
rush
of
progress
to
remain
unchecked
always
if
so
what
mystery
even
of
omnipotent
wisdom
will
remain
unsolved
at
last
what
results
will
not
human
energy
be
able
to
accomplish
is
the
time
to
come
when
man
shall
be
able
to
shape
out
of
clay
fashion
from
wood
or
stone
an
image
of
himself
and
breathing
upon
it
command
it
to
walk
forth
a
thing
of
life
and
be
obeyed
will
he
be
able
to
search
out
a
universal
antidote
to
disease
will
he
discover
the
means
of
supplying
the
human
frame
with
such
recuperative
power
as
will
nullify
the
law
that
prescribes
to
all
flesh
the
dilapidation
and
decay
of
age
of
weakness
and
of
death
will
he
search
out
some
secret
agency
which
will
hold
his
body
in
perpetual
youth
defying
alike
the
attritions
of
age
and
the
ravages
of
disease
will
he
discover
how
it
is
that
time
saps
the
strength
and
steals
away
the
vigor
of
the
human
system
and
a
remedy
for
exhausted
and
wasted
energies
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
advance
a
theory
based
upon
an
affirmative
answer
to
these
inquiries
but
when
we
contemplate
the
stupendous
pace
at
which
the
world
is
moving
forward
who
will
venture
to
assert
where
the
limit
to
this
progress
is
to
be
found
you
tell
me
that
man
can
not
that
he
can
only
combine
into
new
shapes
elements
which
god
has
furnished
to
his
hands
i
do
not
know
this
that
he
not
created
i
admit
but
that
he
has
not
capabilities
as
yet
undeveloped
as
a
creator
i
do
not
know
i
will
not
venture
the
assertion
that
the
time
will
ever
come
when
he
will
have
discovered
wherein
lies
the
mystery
of
life
that
he
will
ever
find
an
antidote
to
disease
that
he
will
search
out
some
recuperative
agency
stronger
than
the
law
of
decay
and
that
will
hold
the
human
system
in
the
perpetual
vigor
and
bloom
and
beauty
of
maturity
i
will
not
assert
that
science
will
at
last
be
carried
to
such
perfection
that
there
shall
be
no
more
infirmities
of
age
that
the
pestilence
will
be
stayed
from
walking
in
the
darkness
and
destruction
from
wasting
at
noonday
that
men
will
cease
to
grow
old
save
in
years
or
that
death
will
be
compelled
to
seek
its
victims
only
through
the
channel
of
accidents
against
which
forecast
will
not
and
science
has
no
opportunity
to
guard
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
i
do
not
know
that
just
such
results
are
beyond
the
capabilities
of
human
progress
measuring
the
future
by
the
past
i
can
not
demonstrate
that
such
results
may
not
one
day
be
attained
the
good
time
of
which
you
speak
said
the
doctor
when
there
shall
be
no
more
infirmity
of
age
no
growing
old
save
in
years
when
there
shall
be
no
wasting
by
disease
through
the
perfectability
of
the
curative
science
or
the
discovery
of
some
recuperative
agency
stronger
than
the
law
of
decay
will
never
come
when
it
is
granted
as
an
abstract
proposition
that
the
capabilities
of
science
are
sufficient
to
counteract
the
mere
wasting
influence
of
time
upon
the
human
system
you
are
met
by
a
great
practical
fact
which
will
overturn
your
theory
the
excesses
of
the
world
are
a
much
more
fruitful
source
of
disease
and
death
than
the
attritions
of
age
there
is
a
constant
struggle
on
the
part
of
nature
to
build
up
and
beautify
to
strengthen
and
recuperate
against
the
results
of
human
excesses
not
one
in
a
million
of
those
who
pass
away
every
year
die
from
the
effects
of
age
as
a
primary
cause
hence
you
must
not
only
perfect
science
but
you
must
perfect
the
morals
and
the
habits
of
the
human
family
before
you
can
exempt
them
from
decay
and
death
the
instincts
of
men
the
appetencies
which
they
possess
in
common
with
the
whole
animal
creation
are
each
made
the
source
of
disease
and
premature
decay
some
men
eat
too
much
some
drink
too
much
some
sleep
too
much
some
waste
their
vital
energies
in
sensual
indulgence
while
all
have
some
vicious
habit
i
mean
with
reference
to
the
preservation
of
life
known
or
unknown
to
the
world
which
sooner
or
later
undermines
the
constitution
and
helps
on
the
work
of
dilapidation
these
excesses
will
always
exist
they
are
inherent
in
the
human
constitution
resulting
from
the
very
nature
of
man
they
are
an
inevitable
sequence
of
his
physical
structure
and
his
intellectual
life
to
avoid
them
implies
absolute
perfectability
in
every
attribute
and
that
makes
him
a
god
until
man
shall
have
become
infinite
in
wisdom
as
well
as
immaculate
in
purity
he
will
continue
to
indulge
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
in
excesses
of
some
sort
and
those
excesses
will
always
be
an
overmatch
when
superadded
to
the
natural
law
of
decay
for
the
recuperative
efforts
of
science
you
must
create
a
radical
reform
in
every
department
of
life
in
business
in
social
habits
in
the
fashions
in
the
mode
of
living
in
everything
before
you
can
hope
to
reach
the
utopia
of
which
you
speak
the
outrages
perpetrated
upon
nature
by
the
conventionalities
of
the
world
alone
would
be
an
insurmountable
barrier
to
the
realization
of
your
idea
the
necessity
for
excessive
labor
to
satisfy
artificial
wants
hews
away
at
one
end
of
society
and
the
indulgence
of
idleness
and
ease
at
the
other
exposure
to
the
elements
to
heat
and
cold
buries
its
millions
and
too
great
seclusion
in
pursuit
of
comfort
in
heated
rooms
and
a
confined
and
corrupted
atmosphere
buries
its
millions
also
lack
of
wholesome
food
fills
thousands
of
graves
and
the
results
of
abundance
fill
other
thousands
lack
of
appropriate
clothing
fitted
for
the
constitution
and
the
seasons
engenders
disease
and
death
and
an
excess
of
the
same
article
fashioned
as
stupendous
folly
only
can
fashion
it
engenders
vastly
more
disease
and
death
there
are
elements
of
decay
and
death
furnished
to
men
and
women
tempting
their
weakness
and
forced
upon
their
adoption
by
the
conventionalities
of
life
every
day
every
hour
and
everywhere
it
is
a
part
of
our
civilization
an
offshoot
of
the
very
progress
of
which
you
speak
a
sort
of
necessity
in
practical
results
at
least
that
men
so
live
as
to
wage
war
against
nature
and
against
themselves
that
they
shall
hurry
themselves
or
be
hurried
by
inevitable
circumstances
into
the
grave
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
you
may
therefore
dismiss
from
your
mind
my
friend
the
fanciful
idea
that
science
will
ever
enable
the
world
to
dispense
with
the
cemeteries
or
that
the
cities
of
the
dead
will
through
its
agency
cease
to
flourish
you
will
find
that
as
science
closes
up
one
avenue
to
the
grave
men
will
force
a
way
to
it
through
another
we
shall
have
to
live
as
our
fathers
lived
be
subject
to
disease
as
they
were
grow
old
as
they
grew
old
and
die
as
they
died
we
must
submit
to
the
law
which
has
written
the
doom
of
decay
upon
all
things
which
has
made
us
mortal
and
when
our
time
comes
we
must
be
content
to
pass
away
as
the
countless
millions
who
preceded
us
have
done
well
said
spalding
as
he
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
and
rose
to
retire
under
the
cover
of
the
tent
for
the
night
be
it
as
you
say
what
matters
it
would
not
live
always
give
to
us
the
hope
of
an
hereafter
a
faith
that
looks
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
and
sees
immortality
a
world
of
glory
beyond
and
what
matters
it
how
soon
the
hour
of
our
departure
shall
come
chapter
xxix
a
mysterious
sound
treed
by
a
moose
angling
for
a
powder
horn
an
unheeded
warning
and
the
consequences
as
spalding
ceased
speaking
there
came
from
away
off
over
the
forest
in
the
direction
of
the
tall
mountain
peaks
a
faint
sound
like
the
boom
of
a
cannon
so
distant
that
it
could
scarcely
be
heard
and
yet
it
was
distinct
and
palpable
to
the
senses
i
say
that
it
came
from
the
direction
of
the
mountains
seen
dim
and
shadowy
in
the
distance
and
yet
none
of
us
were
quite
sure
of
this
we
all
heard
it
but
not
one
of
us
could
assert
that
the
direction
from
which
it
came
was
a
fixed
fact
in
his
mind
there
judge
said
cullen
i
hearn
that
sound
often
among
the
mountains
and
when
i
been
driftin
about
on
these
lakes
it
never
seems
much
louder
or
nearer
it
always
seems
to
come
from
the
mountains
and
yet
you
hear
it
while
shantyin
at
their
base
and
it
sounds
just
as
faint
and
far
off
as
it
did
just
now
what
it
is
or
where
it
comes
from
i
wo
undertake
to
say
the
old
ingins
who
five
and
twenty
year
ago
fished
and
hunted
over
these
regions
told
of
it
as
a
thing
to
wonder
at
and
that
it
was
handed
along
down
from
generation
to
generation
as
one
of
the
mysteries
of
this
wilderness
i
mind
once
i
was
out
among
the
adirondacks
trappin
martin
and
sable
i
shantied
for
a
week
with
crop
under
the
shadow
of
mount
marcy
it
was
twenty
odd
year
ago
and
that
old
mountain
stood
a
good
deal
further
from
a
clearin
than
it
does
now
crop
and
i
had
a
good
many
hard
days
work
that
trip
but
we
got
a
full
pack
of
martin
and
sable
skins
and
two
or
three
wolf
scalps
besides
a
bear
and
a
painter
and
we
did
complain
wal
one
afternoon
we
put
up
a
shanty
in
an
open
spot
two
miles
from
our
regular
campin
ground
and
built
our
fire
for
the
night
there
was
no
moon
and
though
the
stars
shone
out
bright
and
clear
yet
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
forest
it
was
dark
and
gloomy
enough
we
had
eaten
our
supper
and
i
was
my
last
pipe
before
layin
myself
away
when
all
at
once
the
forest
was
lighted
up
like
the
day
it
was
all
the
more
light
from
the
sudden
glare
which
broke
upon
the
darkness
and
there
for
an
instant
stood
the
old
woods
lighted
up
like
noon
every
tree
distinct
every
mountain
every
rock
and
valley
as
perfect
and
plain
to
be
seen
as
if
the
sun
was
standin
right
above
us
in
the
sky
crop
was
as
much
astonished
as
i
was
and
he
crept
to
my
feet
and
trembled
like
a
coward
as
he
crouched
beside
them
i
looked
up
and
flyin
across
the
heavens
was
a
great
ball
of
fire
lookin
for
all
the
world
as
if
the
sun
had
broke
loose
and
was
runnin
away
in
a
fright
a
long
trail
of
light
flashed
and
streamed
along
the
sky
where
it
passed
it
was
out
of
sight
in
a
moment
and
the
fiery
tail
it
left
behind
faded
into
darkness
a
little
while
after
maybe
ten
minutes
after
it
disappeared
that
boomin
sound
came
driftin
down
the
wind
and
i
somehow
it
was
mixed
up
in
some
way
with
that
great
ball
of
fire
that
flew
across
the
sky
maybe
i
was
wrong
but
i
always
it
was
the
bustin
into
pieces
of
that
fiery
thing
that
lighted
up
the
old
woods
that
night
that
broke
the
forest
stillness
like
a
far
off
cannon
i
never
heard
it
so
loud
at
any
other
time
and
when
i
hear
it
now
i
always
say
to
myself
there
goes
another
of
nater
fireballs
into
shivers
i
hearn
it
in
the
daytime
when
the
air
was
still
and
the
forest
voices
were
hushed
but
i
never
at
any
other
time
day
or
night
saw
what
i
suspicioned
occasioned
it
the
ingins
used
to
say
it
came
from
the
mountains
but
it
do
i
hearn
some
folks
pretend
that
it
comes
from
the
bowels
of
the
airth
but
it
do
its
a
thing
of
the
air
and
i
a
notion
it
travels
a
mighty
long
way
from
its
startin
place
afore
it
reaches
us
talkin
about
that
trip
among
the
adirondacks
puts
me
in
mind
of
an
adventer
i
had
with
a
bull
moose
on
one
occasion
among
them
there
are
times
when
sich
an
animal
is
dangerous
i
hearn
tell
of
elephants
gittin
crazy
and
breakin
loose
from
their
keepers
or
killin
them
and
makin
a
general
smash
of
whatever
comes
in
their
way
i
believe
its
so
sometimes
with
a
bull
moose
and
when
the
fit
is
on
the
animal
forgets
its
timid
nater
and
is
bold
and
fierce
as
a
tiger
i
seen
two
sich
in
my
day
one
of
sent
me
into
a
tree
and
the
other
put
me
around
a
great
hemlock
a
dozen
or
twenty
times
a
good
deal
faster
than
i
like
to
travel
in
a
general
way
and
if
i
had
hamstrung
him
with
my
huntin
knife
maybe
he
have
been
chasin
me
round
that
tree
yet
wal
as
i
was
sayin
i
was
out
among
the
adirondacks
one
fall
airly
in
november
i
wounded
a
deer
and
sent
crop
forward
on
his
trail
to
overtake
and
secure
him
it
was
a
big
buck
with
long
horns
and
crop
had
a
pretty
good
general
idea
of
what
sich
things
meant
he
was
cautious
about
cultivatin
too
close
an
acquaintance
with
such
an
animal
unless
something
oncommon
obligated
him
to
do
so
i
heard
him
bayin
a
little
way
over
a
ridge
layin
gist
beyond
where
i
shot
the
buck
i
war
in
any
great
hurry
for
i
knew
crop
would
attend
to
his
case
and
i
i
wipe
out
my
rifle
afore
i
loaded
it
again
i
was
standin
by
the
upturned
roots
of
a
tall
fir
tree
that
had
been
blown
down
and
in
fallin
had
lodged
in
a
crotch
of
a
great
birch
maybe
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
and
broke
off
i
stepped
onto
the
butt
of
the
fallen
spruce
and
was
takin
my
time
to
clean
my
gun
when
i
heard
a
crashin
among
the
brush
on
the
other
side
of
the
ridge
as
if
some
mighty
big
animal
was
comin
my
way
i
walked
pretty
quick
along
up
the
slopin
log
till
i
was
maybe
fifteen
feet
from
the
ground
and
i
saw
crop
comin
over
the
ridge
in
what
the
doctor
would
call
a
high
state
of
narvous
excitement
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
lookin
back
over
his
shoulder
and
his
astonishment
in
a
low
quick
bark
at
every
jump
at
something
he
seemed
to
regard
as
mighty
onpleasant
on
his
trail
i
did
have
to
wait
long
to
find
out
what
it
was
for
about
the
biggest
bull
moose
i
ever
happened
to
see
came
crashin
like
a
after
him
he
was
more
than
two
rods
behind
the
dog
and
if
i
ever
saw
an
ugly
looking
beast
that
moose
was
the
one
every
hair
seemed
to
stand
towards
his
head
and
if
he
was
in
earnest
i
never
saw
an
animal
that
was
he
was
puttin
in
his
best
jumps
and
the
way
he
hurried
up
crop
cakes
was
a
thing
to
be
astonished
at
the
dog
did
see
me
and
seemed
to
be
principled
agin
stoppin
to
inquire
my
whereabouts
he
dashed
under
the
log
where
i
stood
and
the
moose
after
him
like
mad
he
seemed
to
be
expectin
aid
and
comfort
from
me
as
the
papers
say
and
was
wonderin
no
doubt
where
me
and
my
rifle
was
all
this
time
i
called
after
him
but
he
was
in
a
hurry
and
could
stop
for
there
was
a
thing
he
did
care
about
shakin
hands
with
not
three
rods
from
his
tail
he
heard
me
though
and
took
a
circle
round
a
great
boulder
and
the
moose
after
him
and
as
he
got
straightened
my
way
i
called
him
again
and
he
saw
me
he
leaped
onto
the
log
and
came
runnin
up
to
where
i
stood
and
was
mighty
glad
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
them
big
hoofs
and
horns
that
were
after
him
he
was
safe
now
and
he
opened
his
mouth
and
let
off
a
good
deal
of
tall
barkin
at
his
enemy
the
moose
saw
us
and
his
fury
was
the
greater
because
he
could
get
at
us
he
kept
chargin
back
and
forth
under
the
log
we
were
perched
on
and
if
there
was
malice
in
his
eye
i
say
so
when
i
first
saw
him
i
was
standin
with
the
butt
of
my
rifle
on
the
log
my
hand
graspin
the
barrel
and
as
i
caught
it
up
suddenly
to
load
the
string
of
my
caught
between
the
muzzle
and
the
ramrod
broke
and
the
horn
fell
to
the
ground
here
was
a
fix
for
a
hunter
to
be
in
my
rifle
was
empty
and
every
grain
of
powder
i
had
in
the
world
was
in
the
horn
fifteen
feet
below
me
on
the
ground
to
go
down
after
it
was
a
thing
i
was
principled
agin
undertaking
considerin
the
circumstance
of
that
bull
moose
with
his
great
horns
and
the
onpleasant
temper
he
seemed
to
be
in
what
to
do
i
know
i
hollered
and
shouted
at
the
kritter
thinkin
maybe
that
the
voice
of
a
human
might
scare
him
but
it
only
made
him
madder
and
every
time
i
hollered
he
charged
under
the
log
more
furiously
than
before
i
threw
my
huntin
cap
at
him
but
he
pitched
into
it
and
if
he
did
trample
it
into
the
ground
as
if
it
was
a
human
you
may
shoot
me
after
a
while
he
got
tired
of
dashin
back
and
forth
under
the
log
and
took
a
stand
two
or
three
rods
off
and
as
he
eyed
us
shook
his
great
horns
and
stamped
with
his
big
hoofs
as
much
as
to
say
well
gentlemen
i
can
wait
do
hurry
yourselves
take
your
time
but
i
shall
stay
here
as
long
as
you
stay
up
there
and
when
you
do
come
down
we
take
a
turn
that
wo
be
pleasant
to
some
of
us
crop
and
i
took
the
hint
and
sat
still
thinkin
maybe
he
get
over
his
pet
and
move
off
but
he
lean
that
way
at
all
he
seemed
to
made
up
his
mind
to
stay
there
as
long
as
we
stayed
on
the
log
be
the
same
more
or
less
we
sat
there
maybe
an
hour
when
i
happened
to
think
of
a
trollin
line
and
some
fishhooks
i
had
in
my
pocket
and
it
came
across
me
that
possibly
i
might
fish
up
my
powder
horn
so
tyin
half
a
dozen
hooks
to
the
end
of
my
line
i
laid
down
on
the
log
to
angle
for
my
when
i
laid
down
the
old
bull
made
a
pass
under
the
log
as
if
he
expected
me
down
there
and
charged
back
again
as
if
he
was
disappointed
in
not
runnin
agin
me
but
he
saw
no
use
and
took
his
old
stand
agin
i
dropped
down
the
grapnel
and
after
a
great
many
failures
i
hooked
into
the
string
of
the
powder
horn
and
hoisted
away
i
hauled
it
up
mighty
quick
for
the
old
bull
seemed
to
be
suspicions
that
something
was
goin
on
that
might
have
something
to
do
with
his
futer
happiness
and
when
he
got
sight
of
it
the
pass
he
made
was
a
thing
to
stand
out
of
the
way
of
but
he
was
too
late
the
was
safe
and
i
notified
him
as
squire
smith
did
the
cats
to
leave
them
parts
in
just
one
minute
by
the
clock
he
pay
any
attention
to
the
warnin
i
loaded
my
rifle
carefully
and
while
i
was
puttin
on
the
cap
asked
the
gentleman
if
he
calculated
to
move
on
and
let
peaceable
people
alone
he
did
condescend
to
answer
a
word
looking
for
all
the
world
like
a
tiger
in
savageness
well
said
i
as
i
sighted
him
between
the
eyes
your
head
be
it
and
pulled
the
ball
went
crashin
through
his
skull
into
his
brain
and
he
went
down
crop
knew
what
that
meant
he
did
wait
to
run
down
the
log
but
leaped
to
the
ground
and
had
his
teeth
in
the
animal
throat
before
the
echoes
of
my
rifle
were
done
dancin
around
among
the
mountains
i
loaded
my
gun
before
i
came
down
thinkin
maybe
there
might
be
another
bad
tempered
moose
about
but
there
was
crop
and
i
learned
what
we
ought
to
know
before
and
that
was
that
it
a
safe
thing
for
a
hunter
to
have
an
extra
horn
of
powder
in
his
pocket
and
a
loaded
rifle
in
his
hand
when
a
mad
bull
moose
is
on
his
trail
and
that
a
slantin
tree
is
a
good
thing
to
get
onto
at
sich
a
time
chapter
xxx
floating
down
the
rackett
a
black
fox
a
trick
upon
the
martin
trappers
and
its
consequences
we
rose
with
the
dawn
the
next
morning
and
before
the
sun
was
above
the
hills
we
were
on
our
way
down
the
lake
to
separate
as
we
struck
the
rackett
the
doctor
and
smith
to
return
by
the
way
of
keeseville
and
the
champlain
and
spalding
and
myself
to
drift
down
that
pleasant
stream
to
pottsdam
and
thence
to
the
majestic
lawrence
to
spend
a
fortnight
among
the
thousand
islands
of
that
noble
river
near
the
outlet
of
the
lake
is
a
bold
rocky
bluff
rising
right
up
out
of
the
deep
water
twenty
feet
against
which
the
waves
dash
and
around
which
a
romantic
bay
steals
away
to
hide
itself
in
the
old
woods
this
beautiful
bay
is
always
calm
for
even
the
narrow
strait
which
connects
it
with
the
open
water
is
divided
by
a
rocky
but
wooded
island
shutting
out
alike
the
winds
and
the
waves
from
disturbing
its
repose
it
is
surrounded
by
gigantic
forest
trees
whose
shadows
make
it
a
cool
retreat
in
the
heat
of
noon
and
whose
dense
foliage
fills
the
air
with
freshness
and
fragrance
when
the
sun
is
hot
in
the
sky
towards
its
head
a
cold
stream
comes
creeping
around
the
boulders
and
dancing
and
singing
down
the
rocks
from
a
copious
spring
a
short
way
back
in
the
forest
near
where
this
brook
enters
we
landed
at
seven
to
breakfast
we
supplied
ourselves
with
fish
by
casting
across
the
mouth
of
the
little
stream
while
our
boatmen
were
preparing
a
fire
our
sail
of
eight
miles
down
the
lake
furnished
us
with
appetites
which
gave
to
the
beautiful
speckled
trout
we
caught
there
a
peculiar
relish
we
arranged
matters
so
that
the
doctor
and
smith
were
to
return
in
one
boat
to
the
saranacs
while
spalding
and
myself
were
to
move
on
down
the
rackett
with
the
other
two
cullen
and
wood
were
to
go
with
us
to
pottsdam
from
whence
our
route
lay
by
railroad
to
ogdensburgh
we
had
on
entering
the
woods
dispatched
our
baggage
to
the
former
place
to
await
our
arrival
there
at
nine
we
launched
out
upon
the
lake
again
there
are
two
outlets
which
enter
the
rackett
half
a
mile
apart
down
the
right
hand
one
of
which
the
doctor
and
smith
course
lay
and
ours
down
the
left
we
shook
hands
with
our
friends
and
lay
upon
our
oars
while
they
passed
on
towards
home
wishing
them
a
pleasant
voyage
and
a
safe
return
i
say
shouted
smith
as
they
were
about
rounding
a
point
that
would
hide
them
from
our
view
remember
our
compact
about
killing
the
bear
the
glory
of
that
achievement
belongs
to
me
you
know
do
say
a
word
about
it
when
you
get
home
till
you
see
me
i
have
fully
made
up
my
mind
as
to
the
manner
of
capturing
him
and
there
must
be
no
contradictions
on
the
subject
go
ahead
replied
spalding
we
be
careful
of
your
honor
drop
us
a
line
at
cape
vincent
when
you
digested
the
matter
and
stand
by
you
and
our
friends
disappeared
from
our
sight
on
their
voyage
home
and
so
said
spalding
we
are
to
leave
this
beautiful
lake
and
these
old
forests
so
soon
i
could
linger
here
a
month
still
enjoying
these
shady
and
primitive
solitudes
to
you
and
i
the
quiet
which
one
finds
here
is
vastly
more
inviting
than
it
is
to
the
friends
who
have
just
left
us
the
doctor
of
necessity
leads
a
life
of
activity
feeling
physical
weariness
as
the
result
of
his
labors
but
little
of
that
strong
yearning
for
intellectual
repose
which
those
in
your
profession
or
mine
so
often
feel
smith
life
demands
excitement
the
absence
of
the
cares
and
toil
of
business
occasions
a
restlessness
and
desire
of
change
which
makes
him
discontented
here
with
them
the
great
charm
of
this
wild
region
is
its
novelty
they
enjoy
its
beauties
for
a
season
with
peculiar
relish
but
as
these
become
familiar
the
spell
is
broken
and
they
turn
towards
home
without
a
regret
to
you
and
i
there
is
something
beyond
this
we
too
feel
and
appreciate
the
beauty
of
these
lakes
and
mountains
the
and
placid
waters
the
forest
songs
and
wild
scenery
are
pleasant
to
us
but
we
enjoy
them
the
more
from
the
intellectual
relaxation
the
mental
quiet
and
repose
which
we
find
among
them
we
feel
that
we
are
resting
that
the
process
of
recuperation
intellectual
as
well
as
physical
is
going
on
within
us
we
can
almost
trace
its
progress
and
we
feel
that
the
time
spent
by
us
here
is
full
of
profit
as
well
as
pleasure
at
all
events
it
is
so
with
me
and
if
duty
to
others
whose
interests
it
is
my
business
to
serve
did
not
demand
my
return
i
could
enjoy
another
month
here
with
unabated
pleasure
you
have
left
me
little
i
replied
to
add
to
what
you
have
already
said
in
expressing
the
sources
of
my
enjoyment
among
these
beautiful
lakes
fishing
and
hunting
considered
in
the
abstract
are
things
i
care
but
little
about
they
are
pleasant
enough
in
their
way
but
what
brings
me
here
is
the
strong
desire
as
well
as
necessity
for
the
repose
of
which
you
speak
there
is
a
luxury
in
intellectual
rest
when
the
brain
is
wearied
with
protracted
toil
which
far
surpasses
the
mere
animal
enjoyment
which
follows
relaxation
from
physical
labor
that
rest
i
can
not
find
in
society
i
must
seek
it
among
wild
and
primeval
solitudes
where
i
can
be
alone
with
nature
in
her
unadorned
simplicity
away
from
the
barbarisms
so
to
speak
of
civilization
where
i
can
act
and
talk
and
think
as
a
natural
and
not
an
artificial
man
where
i
can
be
off
my
guard
and
free
from
the
weight
of
that
armor
which
the
conventionalities
of
life
the
captions
espionage
of
the
world
compels
us
to
wear
by
the
thousand
enticements
which
society
everywhere
presents
to
lure
us
into
unrest
we
drifted
leisurely
down
the
left
hand
channel
and
entered
the
rackett
bidding
to
the
beautiful
lake
as
a
bend
in
the
river
hid
it
from
our
view
a
mile
below
the
junction
the
river
runs
square
against
a
precipice
some
sixty
feet
in
height
wheeling
off
at
a
right
angle
and
stretching
away
though
a
natural
meadow
on
either
hand
of
hundreds
of
acres
in
extent
at
the
base
of
this
precipice
formed
by
the
rocky
point
of
a
hill
the
water
is
of
unknown
depth
above
and
fifty
feet
from
the
surface
of
the
river
there
are
ledges
of
a
foot
or
two
in
width
like
shelves
along
which
the
fox
the
fisher
and
possibly
the
panther
creep
instead
of
travelling
over
the
high
ridge
extending
back
into
the
forest
as
we
rounded
a
point
which
brought
us
in
view
of
this
precipice
spalding
who
was
in
the
forward
boat
discovered
a
black
object
making
its
way
along
the
face
of
the
rocks
a
signal
for
silence
was
given
and
the
boats
were
permitted
to
float
with
the
current
in
the
direction
of
the
precipice
we
were
forty
rods
distant
and
the
animal
whatever
it
was
had
no
suspicion
of
danger
it
paused
midway
across
the
rocks
looked
about
nosing
out
over
the
water
and
sat
down
upon
its
haunches
as
if
enjoying
the
beauty
of
the
scenery
around
it
in
the
meantime
the
boats
had
drifted
within
twenty
rods
and
spalding
taking
deliberate
aim
fired
at
the
crack
of
the
rifle
the
animal
leapt
dear
of
the
ledge
struck
once
against
the
face
of
the
rock
some
twenty
feet
below
and
then
went
end
over
end
thirty
feet
into
the
river
as
he
struck
the
water
he
commenced
swimming
round
and
round
in
a
circle
evidently
bewildered
by
spalding
bullet
or
the
effect
of
his
involuntary
plunge
down
the
rocks
our
men
bent
to
their
oars
and
had
got
within
five
or
six
rods
of
it
when
it
straightened
up
in
alarm
for
the
shore
hold
on
cullen
said
i
lay
steady
for
a
moment
i
drew
upon
the
animal
and
just
as
it
reached
the
shore
fired
and
it
turned
over
dead
we
found
it
to
be
a
black
fox
that
had
walked
out
upon
the
ledge
and
thus
been
added
another
victim
to
the
indulgence
of
an
idle
curiosity
spalding
bullet
had
grazed
its
belly
raking
off
the
hair
and
graining
the
skin
mine
had
gone
through
its
head
there
judge
said
cullen
as
he
lifted
the
animal
into
the
boat
is
a
kritter
that
is
often
met
with
in
these
parts
and
the
wonder
is
that
he
did
discover
us
as
we
floated
down
the
stream
about
the
cunningest
animal
that
travels
the
woods
he
got
an
eye
that
always
open
a
delicate
ear
and
a
sharp
nose
and
he
keeps
busy
as
a
general
thing
he
never
neglects
their
warnin
but
puts
out
about
the
quickest
whenever
they
notify
him
that
there
an
enemy
about
i
had
a
good
deal
of
trouble
with
them
in
my
day
when
been
out
trappin
martin
they
manage
to
spring
the
trap
and
carry
off
the
bait
when
one
of
them
chaps
gets
on
a
line
of
traps
no
use
in
talkin
the
game
up
and
the
trapper
may
make
up
his
mind
to
get
rid
of
the
varmint
in
some
way
or
locate
in
another
range
of
country
he
find
his
traps
sprung
and
his
bait
gone
or
if
a
martin
has
been
in
ahead
of
the
fox
he
find
only
the
skull
the
end
of
the
tail
the
feet
and
a
few
of
the
larger
bones
and
they
be
picked
mighty
clean
at
that
you
seen
a
martin
trap
or
if
you
have
i
try
and
describe
one
so
that
you
understand
it
a
very
simple
contrivance
and
if
a
martin
was
not
a
good
deal
more
stupid
than
a
goose
he
never
be
caught
in
one
of
them
we
drive
down
a
couple
of
rows
of
little
stakes
plantin
the
stakes
close
together
and
leaving
between
the
rows
a
space
of
six
or
eight
inches
the
rows
are
may
be
a
foot
and
a
half
long
we
then
cut
and
trim
a
long
saplin
say
five
or
six
inches
across
at
the
butt
and
leaving
one
end
on
the
ground
set
the
other
may
be
two
feet
high
with
a
kind
of
figure
four
so
that
when
it
falls
it
will
come
down
between
the
rows
of
stakes
we
fix
the
bait
so
that
a
martin
in
getting
at
it
will
have
to
go
in
between
the
rows
of
stakes
and
displace
the
trap
sticks
when
down
comes
the
pole
upon
him
and
crushes
him
to
death
we
talk
about
a
of
traps
because
we
blaze
a
line
of
trees
sometimes
for
miles
and
set
a
trap
every
twenty
or
thirty
rods
had
a
line
of
a
dozen
miles
or
more
in
my
day
in
a
circle
around
my
campin
ground
in
minding
our
traps
we
follow
the
line
of
marked
trees
from
one
to
the
other
and
so
never
miss
a
trap
nor
get
lost
in
the
woods
i
mind
once
a
good
many
years
ago
crop
and
i
was
over
towards
the
regis
on
a
cruise
after
martin
and
sable
and
anything
else
in
the
way
of
game
we
could
pick
up
i
laid
out
my
arrangements
on
a
pretty
large
scale
and
was
doin
a
little
better
than
midlin
when
i
found
that
my
traps
were
sprung
by
some
animal
that
helped
himself
to
the
bait
without
leavin
his
hide
as
a
consideration
for
settin
of
after
a
few
days
i
found
that
whatever
it
was
understood
the
line
as
well
as
i
did
for
he
took
the
range
regular
and
not
only
stole
the
bait
but
ate
up
half
a
dozen
martin
that
had
given
me
a
claim
on
their
hides
by
springin
my
traps
this
was
a
kind
of
medlin
with
my
private
concerns
that
i
did
like
and
i
was
bound
to
find
out
who
the
interloper
was
and
if
possible
to
make
his
acquaintance
there
was
no
snow
on
the
ground
and
i
could
get
at
his
track
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
watch
for
him
well
one
day
i
spoke
to
crop
to
stay
by
the
shanty
and
take
care
of
the
things
while
i
went
to
find
out
who
it
was
that
was
medlin
with
our
property
and
started
off
on
my
line
of
traps
i
got
up
into
the
crotch
of
a
great
birch
near
one
of
and
sat
there
with
my
rifle
waitin
for
something
to
turn
up
it
was
a
little
after
noon
when
i
got
located
the
sun
travelled
slowly
along
down
towards
the
western
hills
his
bright
light
in
that
calm
november
day
the
rocky
ranges
and
the
bare
heads
of
the
tall
peaks
shine
out
in
a
blaze
of
glory
the
livin
things
of
the
old
woods
were
busy
and
jolly
enough
an
old
owl
came
flying
lazily
out
of
the
thick
branches
of
a
hemlock
and
lightin
within
a
dozen
feet
of
me
opened
his
great
round
eyes
in
astonishment
and
as
the
bright
sunlight
dazzled
him
he
squinted
and
turned
his
face
from
side
to
side
as
if
up
his
mind
that
he
know
me
the
next
time
we
met
he
opened
his
hooked
beak
and
great
red
mouth
and
roared
out
hohoo
hoo
as
much
as
to
say
the
devil
are
you
i
answer
a
word
and
after
a
little
he
flew
back
to
his
shadowy
perch
among
the
dense
foliage
of
the
hemlock
a
black
squirrel
came
hopping
along
with
his
mouth
full
of
beech
nuts
and
running
nimbly
up
the
tree
on
which
i
was
perched
and
out
upon
one
of
the
great
limbs
deposited
his
store
in
a
hollow
he
found
there
he
caught
sight
of
me
as
he
came
back
and
seating
himself
upon
a
branch
not
six
feet
from
my
head
began
chatterin
and
barkin
as
if
givin
me
a
regular
lecter
for
invadin
his
premises
and
takin
possession
of
his
tree
he
did
seem
to
understand
the
matter
at
all
and
i
did
undertake
to
explain
the
reason
of
my
being
there
after
a
little
he
went
off
about
his
business
and
left
me
to
attend
to
mine
a
raccoon
came
nosing
along
stoppin
every
little
way
to
turn
over
the
leaves
or
pull
away
the
dirt
from
a
root
with
his
long
hands
tastin
of
one
thing
and
smellin
of
another
in
a
mighty
dainty
way
when
he
came
to
my
tree
he
seemed
to
think
that
there
might
be
something
among
its
branches
worth
looking
at
so
he
came
clambering
up
its
rough
bark
towards
where
i
sat
he
came
up
on
the
other
side
of
the
tree
from
me
till
he
got
about
even
with
my
and
then
came
round
to
my
side
and
there
we
were
face
to
face
not
two
feet
apart
i
reckon
that
coon
was
astonished
when
our
eyes
met
for
with
a
sort
of
scream
he
let
right
loose
and
dropped
twenty
feet
to
the
ground
like
a
clod
and
the
way
he
waddled
away
into
the
brash
mutterin
and
talkin
to
himself
was
a
thing
to
laugh
at
the
sun
was
may
be
an
hour
high
when
lookin
along
the
line
of
marked
trees
i
saw
a
black
animal
come
trotting
mighty
softly
towards
the
trap
i
was
watchin
i
knew
him
at
once
he
was
a
black
fox
and
i
knew
that
he
was
the
gentleman
that
had
been
makin
free
with
my
property
for
the
last
few
days
he
trotted
up
to
the
trap
and
walked
carefully
around
it
nosin
out
towards
the
bait
but
keepin
out
from
under
the
pole
he
seemed
to
understand
what
that
pole
meant
and
that
if
it
fell
on
him
he
be
very
likely
to
be
hurt
after
a
little
he
trotted
out
to
the
other
end
of
the
pole
and
gettin
on
to
it
walked
carefully
along
to
within
ten
or
twelve
feet
of
the
bait
if
he
begin
jumpin
up
and
down
till
he
sprung
the
trap
you
may
shoot
me
when
he
done
that
job
he
went
back
and
gettin
hold
of
the
bait
with
his
teeth
drew
it
out
and
began
very
cooly
to
eat
it
by
this
time
i
brought
my
rifle
to
bear
upon
the
gentleman
but
i
gave
him
a
little
law
to
see
what
his
next
move
would
be
after
he
finished
the
bait
and
found
there
war
any
more
to
be
come
at
he
stretched
himself
on
his
belly
along
the
ground
and
began
lickin
his
paws
and
passing
them
over
his
cheeks
as
you
seen
a
cat
do
after
washed
his
face
awhile
he
sat
himself
down
on
his
haunches
curled
his
long
bushy
tail
around
his
feet
and
looked
about
as
if
considerin
what
he
should
do
next
just
then
i
paid
my
respects
to
him
and
as
my
rifle
broke
the
stillness
of
the
forest
he
turned
a
double
summerset
and
after
kickin
around
a
little
laid
still
i
came
down
from
my
perch
and
took
the
gentleman
to
the
shanty
and
added
his
hide
to
those
of
the
martins
i
taken
my
traps
disturbed
after
that
and
i
carried
home
a
pack
of
furs
that

two

a
searcher
after

finis
we
floated
quietly
down
the
rackett
carrying
our
boats
around
the
falls
shooting
like
an
arrow
down
the
rapids
or
gliding
along
under
the
shadows
of
the
gigantic
forest
trees
that
line
the
long
calm
reaches
of
that
beautiful
river
we
shook
hands
and
parted
with
our
boatmen
at
the
pleasant
village
of
pottsdam
where
we
arrived
the
second
evening
after
leaving
tupper
lake
we
found
our
baggage
and
it
was
a
pleasant
thing
to
change
our
long
beards
for
shaved
faces
and
our
forest
costume
for
the
garniture
of
the
outer
man
after
the
fashion
of
civilization
we
took
the
cars
for
ogdensburgh
and
the
next
morning
found
us
steaming
up
the
majestic
lawrence
towards
that
paradise
of
fishermen
the
thousand
islands
we
stopped
a
couple
of
days
at
alexandria
bay
and
passed
on
to
cape
vincent
a
beautiful
village
situated
a
mile
or
two
below
where
the
river
takes
its
departure
from
the
broad
lake
beyond
this
pleasant
little
town
is
built
upon
a
wide
sweep
of
tableland
overlooking
the
river
in
front
and
the
open
lake
on
the
west
it
is
accessible
both
by
the
lake
and
river
having
two
or
three
arrivals
and
departures
of
steamboats

railroad
the
great
thoroughfare
between
kingston
and
the
central
portion
of
the
tipper
provinces
and
the
states
it
is
a
delightful
place
in
the
hot
summer
months
with
a
climate
unequalled
for
healthfulness
a
cool
breeze
always
fanning
it
from
the
water
and
in
the
vicinity
the
best
bass
fishing
to
be
found
on
this
continent
opposite
and
just
below
the
town
is
carlton
island
on
which
stand
the
ruins
of
an
old
french
fortification
the
walls
and
trenches
and
the
solitary
chimneys
from
which
the
wooden
barracks
have
rotted
or
been
burned
away
remain
as
melancholy
testimonials
of
the
bloody
strifes
between
the
red
men
of
the
forest
and
the
pioneers
of
civilization
who
were
driving
them
from
the
hunting
grounds
of
their
fathers
the
black
bass
of
the
lawrence
and
ontario
are
the
gamest
fish
that
swim
and
they
are
nowhere
found
in
such
abundance
as
in
the
neighborhood
of
cape
vincent
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
bar
near
the
head
of
carlton
island
we
caught
between
seventy
and
eighty
in
one
afternoon
weighing
from
three
to
five
pounds
each
every
one
of
which
fought
like
a
hero
diving
with
a
plunge
for
the
bottom
skiving
with
a
rush
down
across
or
up
the
river
leaping
clear
from
the
water
and
shaking
his
head
furiously
to
throw
the
hook
loose
from
his
jaw
before
surrendering
to
his
fate
in
wilson
bay

sweet
place
three
miles
from

or
one
and
a
half
by

caught
as
many
more
on
another
afternoon
we
took
a
and
glided
round
lighthouse
point
a
pleasant
drive
of
two
miles
from
the
village
out
into
the
lake
and
steered
for
grenadier
island
five
miles
distant
on
which
we
tented
for
the
night
and
the
bass
we
brought
home
the
next
day
were
something
worth
looking
at
near
the
upper
end
of
long
island
are
other
prolific
bass
shoals
where
the
fisherman
may
enjoy
himself
indeed
he
can
scarcely
go
amiss
in
the
surrounding
waters
the
black
bass
of
the
lawrence
are
not
only
game
fish
but
are
in
excellence
of
flavor
scarcely
excelled
by
any
fish
of
this
country
baked
or
boiled
they
have
few
superiors
and
as
a
pan
fish
are
excelled
only
by
the
of
the
streams
the
season
for
taking
them
commences
in
july
and
continues
through
september
august
is
the
best
month
in
the
year
for
the
bass
fishermen
if
during
that
month
he
will
supply
himself
with
a
strong
a
strong
reel
stout
silk
lines
and
proper
hooks
and
visit
gape
vincent
he
will
find
boatmen
with
a
supply
of
minnows
ready
to
serve
him
and
if
he
fails
to
enjoy
himself
for
a
fortnight
among
the
black
bass
of
the
st
lawrence
and
ontario
he
may
count
himself
as
a
man
who
is
very
hard
to
please
we
spent
a
pleasant
week
at
cape
vincent
and
then
turned
our
faces
homeward
invigorated
in
strength
and
buoyant
in
spirits
to
begin
again
a
round
of
toil
from
which
we
at
least
could
claim
no
further
exemption
h
said
a
friend
of
mine
as
he
stalked
into
my
sanctum
a
few
days
after
my
return
and
seated
himself
at
my
elbow
as
if
for
a
private
and
confidential
talk
did
smith
really
shoot
the
bear
the
skin
of
which
he
brought
home
and
which
he
exhibits
with
such
triumph
tell
me
honestly
as
between
you
and
me
did
he
in
fact
shoot
him
smith
certainly
did
shoot
that
bear
i
replied
but
is
the
marvellous
story
he
tells
about
the
manner
of
killing
him
really
true
that
of
course
i
can
not
tell
i
replied
as
i
have
never
heard
the
story
why
said
my
friend
he
tells
about
a
beautiful
lake
lying
away
back
in
the
northern
wilderness
above
which
mount
marcy
and
mount
seward
and
other
nameless
peaks
of
the
adirondacks
rear
their
tall
heads
to
the
clouds
throwing
back
the
sunlight
in
a
blaze
of
glory
on
which
the
moonbeams
lie
like
a
mantle
of
silver
while
away
down
in
its
fathomless
depths
the
stars
glow
and
sparkle
like
the
sheen
of
a
million
of
diamonds
of
the
old
forests
and
trees
of
fabulous
growth
stretching
away
and
away
on
every
hand
throwing
their
sombre
shadows
far
out
over
the
water
in
whose
tangled
recesses
countless
deer
and
moose
and
panthers
and
bears
range
and
among
whose
branches
birds
of
unknown
melody
carol
that
one
side
of
this
beautiful
lake
is
palisadoed
by
a
wall
of
rocks
stand
straight
up
sixty
feet
high
near
the
top
of
which
is
a
shelf
or
narrow
pathway
along
which
two
men
can
scarcely
walk
abreast
that
he
was
passing
along
this
pathway
one
afternoon
examining
the
rocks
and
looking
for
geological
specimens
below
him
was
a
precipice
of
fifty
feet
against
the
base
of
which
the
waves
when
the
winds
swept
over
the
lake
dashed
around
him
the
birds
that
build
their
nests
in
the
crevices
of
the
rock
were
whirling
and
screaming
while
before
him
lay
the
beautiful
lake
motionless
and
calm
as
if
it
had
fallen
asleep
and
was
slumbering
sweetly
in
its
forest
bed
that
he
was
passing
leisurely
along
with
his
rifle
at
a
trail
admiring
the
transcendent
loveliness
of
the
scenery
around
him
where
the
rugged
and
the
sublime
the
placid
and
the
beautiful
were
so
magnificently
mingled
when
in
turning
a
sharp
angle
a
huge
bear
copy
shouted
the
printer
devil
as
he
came
plunging
down
three
steps
at
a
bound
from
the
compositors
room
above
copy
he
screamed
as
he
dove
into
the
outer
office
where
that
article
was
usually
kept
but
found
none
said
he
as
he
opened
my
door
so
gently
with
a
voice
so
quiet
and
a
look
so
innocent
that
one
might
well
be
excused
for
believing
that
he
had
never
spoken
a
loud
word
in
his
life
h
the
foreman
desired
me
to
ask
you
for
some
copy
you
see
my
friend
said
i
to
the
anxious
inquirer
after
truth
that
i
am
exceedingly
busy
just
now
you
will
excuse
me
therefore
for
referring
you
to
the
doctor
and
spalding
who
know
all
about
the
matter
good
day
and
my
friend
departed
without
finishing
the
story
smith
told
him
about
his
killing
the
bear
i
have
never
heard
the
balance
of
that
story
yet
and
now
reader
a
word
to
you
and
i
have
done
when
the
sun
comes
up
over
the
city
day
after
day
pouring
his
burning
rays
along
the
glimmering
streets
shining
on
and
on
in
a
changeless
glare
till
he
hides
himself
in
the
darkness
again
when
your
strength
wilts
under
the
enervating
influences
of
the
summer
heats
and
you
pant
for
the
forest
breezes
and
the
cooling
streams
remember
that
the
same
wild
region
i
have
been
describing
the
same
pleasant
rivers
beautiful
lakes
tall
mountains
and
primeval
forests
are
there
still
all
inviting
you
to
test
their
recuperative
agencies
the
same
singing
birds
the
fishes
and
the
game
are
there
waiting
your
pleasure
visit
them
when
the
summer
heat
makes
the
cities
a
desolation
give
a
month
to
the
enjoyment
of
a
and
you
will
return
to
your
labors
invigorated
in
strength
buoyant
in
spirit
a
