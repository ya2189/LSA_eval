progressive
morality
an
essay
in
ethics
by
thomas
fowler
president
of
corpus
christi
college
wykeham
professor
of
logic
in
the
university
of
oxford
preface
these
pages
represent
an
attempt
to
exhibit
a
scientific
conception
of
morality
in
a
popular
form
and
with
a
view
to
practical
applications
rather
than
the
discussion
of
theoretical
difficulties
for
this
purpose
it
has
been
necessary
to
study
brevity
and
avoid
controversy
hence
i
have
made
few
references
to
other
authors
and
i
have
almost
altogether
dispensed
with
but
though
i
have
attempted
to
state
rather
than
to
defend
my
views
i
believe
that
they
are
in
the
main
those
which
making
exception
for
a
few
back
eddies
in
the
stream
of
modern
thought
are
winning
their
way
to
general
acceptance
among
the
more
instructed
and
reflective
men
of
our
day
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
state
that
this
essay
is
independent
of
a
much
larger
work
entitled
the
of
morals
on
which
i
was
some
years
ago
engaged
with
my
predecessor
the
late
professor
wilson
owing
to
the
declining
state
of
his
health
during
the
latter
years
of
his
life
that
work
was
at
the
time
of
his
death
left
in
a
condition
which
rendered
its
completion
very
difficult
and
its
publication
probably
undesirable
for
the
present
work
i
am
solely
responsible
though
no
one
can
have
been
brought
into
close
contact
with
so
powerful
a
mind
as
that
of
professor
wilson
without
deriving
from
it
much
stimulus
and
retaining
many
traces
of
its
influence
it
has
long
been
my
belief
that
the
questions
of
theoretical
ethics
would
be
far
less
open
to
dispute
as
well
as
far
more
intelligible
if
they
were
considered
with
more
direct
reference
to
practice
this
little
book
will
i
trust
furnish
an
example
however
slight
and
imperfect
of
such
a
mode
of
treatment

chapter

introduction
the
sanctions
of
conduct
all
reflecting
men
acknowledge
that
both
the
theory
and
the
practice
of
morality
have
advanced
with
the
general
advance
in
the
intelligence
and
civilisation
of
the
human
race
but
if
this
be
so
morality
must
be
a
matter
capable
of
being
reasoned
about
a
subject
of
investigation
and
of
teaching
in
which
the
less
intelligent
members
of
a
community
have
always
something
to
learn
from
the
more
intelligent
and
the
more
intelligent
in
their
turn
have
ever
fresh
problems
to
solve
and
new
material
to
study
it
becomes
then
of
prime
importance
to
every
educated
man
to
ask
what
are
the
data
of
ethics
what
is
the
method
by
which
its
general
principles
are
investigated
what
are
the
considerations
which
the
moralist
ought
to
apply
to
the
solution
of
the
complex
difficulties
of
life
and
action
and
still
in
spite
of
these
obvious
facts
ethical
investigation
or
any
approach
to
an
independent
review
of
the
current
morality
is
always
unpopular
with
the
great
mass
of
mankind
though
the
conduct
of
their
own
lives
is
the
subject
which
most
concerns
men
it
is
that
in
which
they
are
least
patient
of
speculation
nothing
is
so
wounding
to
the
of
a
man
of
indolent
habits
of
mind
as
to
call
in
question
any
of
the
moral
principles
on
which
he
habitually
acts
praise
and
blame
are
usually
apportioned
even
by
educated
men
according
to
vague
and
general
rules
with
little
or
no
regard
to
the
individual
circumstances
of
the
case
and
of
all
innovators
the
innovator
on
ethical
theory
is
apt
to
be
the
most
unpopular
and
to
be
the
least
able
to
secure
impartial
attention
to
his
speculations
and
hence
it
is
that
vague
theories
couched
in
unintelligible
or
only
language
and
almost
totally
inapplicable
to
practice
have
usually
done
duty
for
what
is
called
a
system
of
moral
philosophy
the
authors
or
exponents
of
such
theories
have
the
good
fortune
at
once
to
avoid
odium
and
to
acquire
a
reputation
for
profundity
in
the
following
pages
i
shall
attempt
to
discriminate
morality
properly
so
called
from
other
sanctions
of
conduct
to
determine
the
precise
functions
and
the
ultimate
justification
of
the
moral
sentiment
or
in
other
words
of
the
moral
sanction
to
enquire
how
this
sentiment
has
been
formed
and
how
it
may
be
further
educated
and
improved
to
discover
some
general
test
of
conduct
to
give
examples
of
the
application
of
this
test
to
existing
moral
rules
and
moral
feelings
with
a
view
to
shew
how
far
they
may
be
justified
and
how
far
they
require
extension
or
reformation
as
my
subject
is
almost
exclusively
practical
i
shall
studiously
avoid
mere
theoretical
puzzles
such
as
is
that
of
the
freedom
of
the
will
which
in
whatever
way
resolved
probably
never
influences
and
never
will
influence
any
sane
man
conduct
questions
of
this
kind
will
always
excite
interest
in
the
sphere
of
speculation
and
speculation
is
a
necessity
of
the
cultivated
human
intellect
but
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
they
can
be
profitably
discussed
in
a
treatise
the
aim
of
which
is
simply
to
suggest
principles
for
examining
for
testing
and
if
possible
for
improving
the
prevailing
sentiment
on
matters
of
practical
morals
to
begin
with
the
first
division
of
my
subject
how
is
morality
properly
so
called
discriminated
from
other
sanctions
of
conduct
by
a
sanction
i
may
premise
that
i
mean
any
pleasure
which
attracts
to
as
well
as
any
pain
which
deters
from
a
given
course
of
action
in
books
on
jurisprudence
this
word
is
usually
employed
to
designate
merely
pains
or
penalties
but
this
circumstance
arises
from
the
fact
that
at
least
in
modern
times
the
law
seldom
has
recourse
to
rewards
and
effects
its
ends
almost
exclusively
by
means
of
punishments
when
we
are
considering
conduct
however
in
its
general
aspects
and
not
exclusively
in
its
relations
to
law
we
appear
to
need
a
word
to
express
any
inducement
whether
of
a
pleasureable
or
painful
nature
which
may
influence
a
actions
and
such
a
word
the
term
seems
conveniently
to
supply
taking
the
word
in
this
extended
sense
the
sanctions
of
conduct
may
be
enumerated
as
the
physical
the
legal
the
social
the
religious
and
the
moral
of
the
physical
sanction
familiar
examples
may
be
found
in
the
headache
from
which
a
man
suffers
after
a
night
debauch
the
pleasure
of
relaxation
which
awaits
a
holiday
the
danger
to
life
or
limb
which
is
attendant
on
reckless
exercise
or
the
glow
of
constant
satisfaction
which
rewards
a
healthy
habit
of
life
these
pleasures
and
pains
when
once
experienced
exercise
for
the
future
an
attracting
or
a
deterring
influence
as
the
case
may
be
on
the
courses
of
conduct
with
which
they
have
respectively
become
associated
thus
a
man
who
has
once
suffered
from
a
severe
headache
after
a
will
be
likely
to
exercise
more
discretion
in
future
or
the
prospect
of
agreeable
diversion
at
the
end
of
a
hard
day
work
will
quicken
a
man
efforts
to
execute
his
task
the
legal
sanction
is
too
familiar
to
need
illustration
without
penal
laws
no
society
of
any
size
could
exist
for
a
day
there
are
however
two
characteristics
of
this
sanction
which
it
is
important
to
point
out
one
is
that
it
works
almost
exclusively
by
means
of
penalties
it
would
be
an
endless
and
thankless
business
in
a
society
of
any
size
even
if
it
were
possible
to
attempt
to
reward
the
virtuous
for
their
consideration
in
not
breaking
the
laws
the
cheap
the
effective
indeed
in
most
cases
the
only
possible
method
is
to
punish
the
transgressor
by
a
carefully
devised
and
properly
graduated
system
of
penalties
each
citizen
is
thus
furnished
with
the
strongest
inducement
to
refrain
from
those
acts
which
may
injure
or
annoy
his
neighbour
another
characteristic
of
the
legal
sanction
is
that
though
it
is
professedly
addressed
to
all
citizens
alike
it
actually
affects
the
uneducated
and
lower
classes
far
more
than
the
educated
and
higher
classes
of
society
this
circumstance
arises
partly
from
the
fact
that
persons
in
a
comfortable
position
of
life
are
under
little
temptation
to
commit
the
more
ordinary
crimes
forbidden
by
law
such
as
are
theft
assault
and
the
like
and
partly
from
the
fact
that
their
education
and
associations
make
them
more
amenable
to
the
social
and
in
most
cases
to
the
moral
and
religious
sanctions
about
to
be
described
presently
few
persons
in
what
are
called
the
higher
or
middle
ranks
of
life
have
any
temptation
to
commit
say
an
act
of
theft
and
if
they
experienced
any
such
temptation
they
would
be
at
least
as
likely
to
be
restrained
by
the
consideration
of
what
their
neighbours
would
think
or
say
about
them
even
apart
from
their
own
moral
and
religious
convictions
as
by
the
fear
of
imprisonment
footnote
there
are
a
few
exceptions
to
the
rule
that
the
sanctions
employed
by
the
state
assume
the
form
of
punishments
rather
than
of
rewards
such
are
titles
and
honours
pensions
awarded
for
distinguished
service
rewards
to
informers
but
these
exceptions
are
almost
insignificant
when
compared
with
the
numerous
examples
of
the
general
rule
one
of
the
most
effective
sanctions
in
all
conditions
of
life
but
especially
in
the
upper
and
better
educated
circles
of
a
civilized
society
is
what
may
be
called
the
social
sanction
that
is
to
say
a
regard
for
the
good
opinion
and
a
dread
of
the
evil
opinion
of
those
who
know
us
and
especially
of
those
amongst
whom
we
habitually
live
it
is
one
of
the
characteristics
of
this
sanction
that
it
is
much
more
than
the
legal
sanction
not
only
does
it
extend
to
many
acts
of
a
moral
character
which
are
not
affected
in
most
countries
by
the
legal
sanction
such
as
lying
backbiting
ingratitude
unkindness
cowardice
but
also
to
mere
matters
of
taste
or
fashion
such
as
dress
etiquette
and
even
the
proprieties
of
language
indeed
as
to
the
latter
class
of
actions
there
is
always
considerable
danger
of
the
social
sanction
becoming
too
strong
society
is
apt
to
insist
on
all
men
being
cast
in
one
mould
without
much
caring
to
examine
the
character
of
the
mould
which
it
has
adopted
and
it
frequently
happens
that
a
wholly
disproportionate
value
thus
comes
to
be
attached
to
the
observance
of
mere
rules
of
etiquette
and
as
compared
with
acts
and
feelings
which
really
concern
the
moral
and
social
welfare
of
mankind
there
is
many
a
man
moving
in
good
society
who
would
rather
be
guilty
of
and
even
detected
in
an
act
of
unkindness
or
mendacity
than
be
seen
in
an
unfashionable
dress
or
commit
a
grammatical
solecism
or
a
broach
of
social
etiquette
vulgarity
to
such
men
is
a
worse
reproach
than
hardness
of
heart
or
indifferent
morality
in
these
cases
as
we
shall
see
hereafter
the
social
sanction
requires
to
be
corrected
by
the
moral
and
religious
sanctions
and
it
is
the
special
province
of
the
moral
and
religious
teacher
in
each
generation
to
take
care
that
this
correction
shall
be
duly
and
effectively
applied
the
task
may
from
time
to
time
require
the
drastic
hand
of
the
moral
or
religious
reformer
but
unless
some
one
has
the
courage
to
undertake
it
we
are
in
constant
danger
of
neglecting
the
weightier
matters
of
the
law
while
we
are
busy
with
the
mint
and
cummin
and
anise
of
fashion
and
convention
but
notwithstanding
the
danger
of
exaggeration
and
misapplication
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
vast
importance
and
the
generally
beneficial
results
of
a
keen
sensitiveness
to
the
opinions
of
our
without
the
powerful
aid
of
this
sanction
the
restraints
of
morality
and
religion
would
often
be
totally
ineffective
when
the
social
sanction
operates
not
through
society
generally
but
through
particular
sections
of
society
it
may
be
called
a
law
of
honour
a
term
which
originated
in
the
usages
of
chivalry
in
a
complex
and
civilized
form
of
society
such
as
our
own
there
may
be
many
such
laws
of
honour
and
the
same
individual
may
be
subject
to
several
of
them
thus
each
profession
the
army
the
navy
the
clerical
the
legal
the
medical
the
artistic
the
dramatic
profession
has
its
own
peculiar
code
of
honour
or
rules
of
professional
etiquette
which
its
members
can
only
infringe
on
pain
of
ostracism
or
at
least
of
loss
of
professional
reputation
the
same
is
the
case
with
trades
and
is
specially
exemplified
in
the
instance
of
or
their
mediaeval
prototypes
the
guilds
a
college
or
a
school
again
has
its
own
rules
and
traditions
which
the
tutor
or
undergraduate
the
master
or
boy
can
often
only
violate
at
his
extreme
peril
almost
every
club
institution
and
society
affords
another
instance
in
point
the
class
of
too
that
is
to
say
speaking
roughly
the
upper
and
upper
middle
ranks
of
society
claim
to
have
a
code
of
honour
of
their
own
superior
to
that
of
the
ordinary
citizen
a
breach
of
this
code
is
called
rather
than
wrong
or
immoral
or
unjust
or
unkind
so
far
as
this
code
insists
on
courtesy
of
demeanour
and
delicacy
of
feeling
and
conduct
it
is
a
valuable
complement
to
the
ordinary
rules
of
morality
though
so
far
as
it
fulfils
this
function
it
plainly
ought
not
to
be
the
exclusive
possession
of
one
class
but
ought
to
be
communicated
by
means
of
example
and
education
to
the
classes
who
are
now
supposed
to
be
bereft
of
it
there
are
points
in
this
code
however
such
as
that
the
payment
of
of
honour
should
take
precedence
of
that
of
tradesmen
bills
and
that
less
courtesy
is
due
to
persons
in
an
inferior
station
than
to
those
in
our
own
which
at
least
merit
it
may
indeed
be
said
of
all
these
laws
or
codes
of
honour
that
though
they
have
probably
on
the
whole
a
salutary
effect
in
maintaining
a
high
standard
of
conduct
in
the
various
bodies
or
classes
where
they
obtain
they
require
to
be
constantly
watched
lest
they
should
become
capricious
or
tyrannical
and
specially
lest
they
should
conflict
with
the
wider
interests
of
society
or
the
deeper
instincts
of
morality
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
we
are
before
we
are
and
that
no
claims
of
any
profession
institution
or
class
can
replace
or
supplant
those
of
humanity
and
citizenship
we
see
then
or
rather
we
are
obliged
at
the
present
stage
of
our
enquiry
to
assume
that
the
social
sanction
whether
it
be
derived
from
the
average
sentiment
of
society
at
large
or
from
the
customs
and
opinions
of
particular
aggregates
of
society
requires
constant
correction
at
the
hands
of
the
moralist
the
sentiment
which
it
represents
may
be
only
the
sentiment
of
men
of
average
moral
tone
or
it
may
even
be
that
of
men
of
an
inferior
or
degraded
morality
and
hence
it
often
needs
to
be
tested
by
the
application
of
rules
derived
from
a
higher
standard
both
of
feeling
and
intelligence
nor
is
it
the
moral
standard
only
which
may
be
used
to
correct
the
social
standard
we
may
often
advantageously
have
recourse
to
the
legal
standard
for
the
same
purpose
for
the
laws
of
a
country
express
as
a
rule
the
sentiments
of
the
wisest
and
most
experienced
of
its
citizens
and
hence
we
might
naturally
expect
that
they
would
be
in
advance
of
the
average
moral
sentiment
of
the
people
as
well
as
of
the
social
traditions
of
particular
professions
or
classes
and
this
i
believe
to
be
usually
the
case
for
instances
we
have
to
go
no
further
than
the
comparison
between
the
laws
and
the
popular
or
professional
sentiment
on
bribery
at
elections
on
smuggling
on
evasion
of
taxation
on
fraudulent
business
transactions
on
duelling
on
or
on
gambling
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
confessed
that
as
laws
sometimes
become
antiquated
and
the
leanings
of
lawyers
are
proverbially
conservative
it
occasionally
happens
that
on
some
points
the
average
moral
sentiment
is
in
advance
of
the
law
i
may
select
as
examples
from
comparatively
recent
legal
history
the
continuance
of
religious
disabilities
and
the
excessive
punishment
of
ordinary
or
even
trivial
crimes
and
perhaps
i
may
venture
to
add
as
a
possible
reform
in
the
future
now
largely
demanded
by
popular
sentiment
some
considerable
modifications
of
the
laws
regulating
the
transfer
of
and
the
succession
to
landed
property
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
law
and
the
sentiment
of
society
may
each
be
employed
as
corrective
of
the
other
and
that
consequently
their
comparison
implies
a
higher
standard
than
either
by
means
of
which
each
may
be
tested
and
to
which
each
in
its
turn
may
be
referred
this
higher
or
common
standard
it
will
be
our
business
to
consider
in
a
subsequent
part
of
this
essay
meanwhile
it
may
be
pointed
out
that
in
addition
to
its
function
as
an
occasional
corrective
of
the
legal
sanction
the
social
sanction
subserves
two
great
objects
first
it
largely
complements
the
legal
sanction
being
applicable
to
numberless
cases
which
that
sanction
does
not
and
in
fact
can
not
reach
secondly
the
legal
sanction
even
in
those
cases
which
it
reaches
is
greatly
reinforced
by
the
social
sanction
which
adds
the
pains
arising
from
an
evil
reputation
and
all
the
indefinable
social
inconveniences
which
an
evil
reputation
brings
with
it
to
the
actual
penalties
inflicted
by
the
law
the
religious
sanction
varies
of
course
with
the
different
religious
creeds
and
in
the
more
imperfect
forms
of
religion
by
no
means
always
operates
in
favour
of
morality
but
it
will
be
sufficient
here
to
consider
the
religious
sanction
solely
in
relation
to
christianity
as
enforced
by
the
bible
and
the
church
the
religious
sanctions
of
conduct
are
two
which
i
shall
call
the
higher
and
the
lower
sanctions
by
the
latter
i
mean
the
hope
of
the
divine
reward
or
the
fear
of
the
divine
punishment
either
in
this
world
or
the
next
by
the
former
the
love
of
god
and
that
veneration
for
his
nature
which
irresistibly
inspires
the
effort
to
imitate
his
perfections
the
lower
religious
sanction
is
plainly
the
same
in
kind
with
the
legal
sanction
if
a
man
is
induced
to
do
or
to
refrain
from
doing
a
certain
action
from
fear
of
punishment
the
motive
is
the
same
whether
the
punishment
be
for
a
long
time
or
a
short
one
whether
it
is
to
take
immediate
effect
or
to
be
deferred
for
a
term
of
years
and
similarly
the
same
is
the
case
with
rewards
no
peculiar
merit
as
it
appears
to
me
can
be
claimed
by
a
man
because
he
acts
from
fear
of
divine
punishment
rather
than
of
human
punishment
or
from
hope
of
divine
rewards
rather
than
of
human
rewards
the
only
differences
between
the
two
sanctions
are
that
the
hopes
and
fears
inspired
by
the
religious
sanction
are
to
one
who
believes
in
their
reality
far
more
intense
than
those
inspired
by
the
legal
sanction
the
two
being
related
as
the
temporal
to
the
eternal
and
that
inasmuch
as
god
is
regarded
as
omnipresent
and
omniscient
the
religious
sanction
is
immeasurably
more
than
the
legal
sanction
or
even
than
the
legal
and
the
social
sanctions
combined
thus
the
lower
religious
sanction
is
to
those
who
really
believe
in
it
far
more
effective
than
the
legal
sanction
though
it
is
the
same
in
kind
but
the
higher
religious
sanction
appeals
to
a
totally
different
class
of
motives
the
motives
of
love
and
reverence
rather
than
of
hope
and
fear
in
this
higher
frame
of
mind
we
keep
god
commandments
because
we
love
him
not
because
we
hope
for
his
rewards
or
fear
his
punishments
we
reverence
god
and
therefore
we
strive
to
be
like
him
to
be
perfect
even
as
he
is
perfect
we
have
attained
to
that
state
of
mind
in
which
perfect
love
has
cast
out
fear
and
hence
we
simply
do
good
and
act
righteously
because
god
who
is
the
supreme
object
of
our
love
and
the
supreme
ideal
of
conduct
is
good
and
righteous
there
can
be
no
question
that
in
this
case
the
motives
are
far
loftier
and
purer
than
in
the
case
of
the
legal
and
the
lower
religious
sanctions
but
there
are
few
men
probably
capable
of
these
exalted
feelings
and
therefore
for
the
great
mass
of
mankind
the
external
inducements
to
right
conduct
must
probably
continue
to
be
sought
in
the
coarser
motives
it
may
be
mentioned
before
concluding
this
notice
of
the
religious
sanctions
that
there
is
a
close
affinity
between
the
higher
religious
sanction
and
that
form
of
the
social
sanction
which
operates
through
respect
for
the
good
opinions
of
those
of
our
whom
we
love
reverence
or
admire
but
quite
distinct
from
all
the
sanctions
thus
far
enumerated
there
is
another
sanction
which
is
derived
from
our
own
reflexion
on
our
own
actions
and
the
approbation
or
disapprobation
which
after
such
reflexion
we
bestow
upon
them
there
are
actions
which
on
no
reasonable
estimate
of
probabilities
can
ever
come
to
the
knowledge
of
any
other
person
than
ourselves
but
which
we
look
back
on
with
pleasure
or
regret
it
may
be
said
that
though
in
these
cases
the
legal
and
the
social
sanctions
are
confessedly
excluded
the
sanction
which
really
operates
is
the
religious
sanction
in
either
its
higher
or
its
lower
form
but
it
can
hardly
be
denied
that
even
where
there
is
no
belief
in
god
or
at
least
no
vivid
sense
of
his
presence
nor
any
effective
expectation
of
his
intervention
the
same
feelings
are
experienced
these
feelings
then
appear
to
be
distinct
in
character
from
any
of
the
others
which
we
have
so
far
considered
and
they
constitute
what
may
appropriately
be
called
the
moral
sanction
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
term
it
is
one
of
the
faults
of
bentham
system
that
he
confounds
this
sanction
with
the
social
sanction
speaking
indifferently
of
the
moral
popular
that
is
to
say
social
sanction
but
let
any
one
examine
carefully
for
himself
the
feelings
of
satisfaction
or
dissatisfaction
with
which
he
looks
back
upon
past
acts
of
his
own
life
and
ask
himself
whether
he
can
discover
in
those
feelings
any
reference
to
the
praise
or
blame
of
other
persons
actual
or
possible
there
will
if
i
mistake
not
be
many
of
them
in
which
he
can
discover
no
such
reference
but
in
which
the
feeling
is
simply
that
of
satisfaction
with
himself
for
having
done
what
he
ought
to
have
done
or
dissatisfaction
with
himself
for
having
done
that
which
he
ought
not
to
have
done
whether
these
feelings
admit
of
analysis
and
explanation
is
another
question
and
one
with
which
i
shall
deal
presently
but
of
their
reality
and
distinctness
no
competent
and
impartial
person
on
careful
can
well
doubt
the
answer
then
to
our
first
question
i
conceive
to
be
that
the
moral
sanction
properly
so
called
is
distinguished
from
all
other
sanctions
of
conduct
in
that
it
has
no
regard
to
the
prospect
of
physical
pleasure
or
pain
or
to
the
hope
of
reward
or
fear
of
punishment
or
to
the
estimation
in
which
we
shall
be
held
by
any
other
being
than
ourselves
but
that
it
has
regard
simply
and
solely
to
the
internal
feeling
of
satisfaction
or
dissatisfaction
with
which
on
reflexion
we
shall
look
back
upon
our
own
acts
chapter
ii
the
moral
sanction
or
moral
sentiment
its
functions
and
the
justification
of
its
claims
to
superiority
i
now
proceed
to
consider
more
at
length
what
are
the
precise
functions
of
the
moral
sentiment
or
moral
sanction
and
what
is
the
justification
of
the
weight
which
we
attach
to
it
or
rather
of
the
preference
which
we
assign
to
it
or
feel
that
we
ought
to
assign
to
it
over
all
the
other
sanctions
of
conduct
we
have
already
seen
that
the
moral
sentiment
or
sanction
is
the
feeling
of
satisfaction
or
dissatisfaction
which
we
experience
when
we
reflect
on
our
own
acts
without
any
reference
to
any
external
authority
or
external
opinion
now
it
is
important
to
ask
whether
this
feeling
is
uniformly
felt
on
the
occurrence
of
the
same
acts
or
whether
it
ever
varies
so
that
acts
for
instance
which
are
at
one
time
viewed
with
satisfaction
are
at
another
time
regarded
with
indifference
or
with
positive
dissatisfaction
it
would
seem
as
if
no
man
who
reflects
on
ethical
subjects
and
profits
by
the
observation
and
experience
of
life
could
possibly
answer
this
question
in
any
other
than
one
way
there
must
be
very
few
educated
and
reflective
men
who
have
not
seen
reason
with
advancing
years
to
alter
their
opinion
on
many
of
at
least
the
minor
points
of
morality
in
which
they
were
instructed
as
children
a
familiar
instance
occurs
at
once
in
the
different
way
in
which
most
of
us
view
or
attendance
at
balls
or
theatres
from
the
much
stricter
views
which
prevailed
in
many
respectable
english
households
a
generation
ago
on
the
other
hand
excess
in
eating
and
drinking
is
regarded
with
far
less
indulgence
now
than
it
was
in
the
days
of
our
fathers
and
grandfathers
on
these
points
then
at
least
and
such
as
these
it
must
be
allowed
that
there
is
a
variation
of
moral
sentiment
or
in
other
words
that
the
acts
condemned
or
approved
by
the
moral
sanction
are
not
invariably
the
same
moreover
any
of
us
who
are
accustomed
to
reason
on
moral
questions
and
can
observe
carefully
the
processes
through
which
the
mind
passes
will
notice
that
there
is
constantly
going
on
a
so
to
speak
of
our
ethical
opinions
whether
we
are
reviewing
abstract
questions
of
morality
or
the
specific
acts
of
ourselves
or
others
we
at
one
time
think
ourselves
or
others
more
and
at
another
time
less
blameable
for
the
acts
or
we
come
to
regard
some
particular
class
of
acts
in
a
different
light
from
what
we
used
to
do
either
modifying
our
praise
or
blame
or
in
extreme
cases
actually
substituting
one
for
the
other
but
though
these
facts
are
patent
and
may
be
verified
by
any
one
in
his
experience
either
of
himself
or
others
there
have
actually
been
moralists
who
have
appeared
to
maintain
the
position
that
when
a
man
is
unbiassed
by
passion
or
interest
his
moral
judgments
are
and
must
be
invariably
the
same
this
error
has
undoubtedly
been
largely
fostered
by
the
loose
and
popular
use
of
the
terms
conscience
and
moral
sense
these
terms
and
especially
the
word
conscience
are
often
employed
to
designate
a
sort
of
mysterious
entity
supposed
to
have
been
implanted
in
the
mind
by
god
himself
and
endowed
by
him
with
the
unique
prerogative
of
infallibility
even
so
philosophical
and
sober
a
writer
as
bishop
butler
has
given
some
countenance
to
this
extravagant
supposition
and
to
the
exaggerated
language
which
he
employs
on
the
prerogatives
of
conscience
and
to
the
emphatic
manner
in
which
he
insists
on
the
absolute
if
not
the
infallible
character
of
its
decisions
may
be
traced
much
of
the
misconception
which
still
prevails
on
the
subject
but
we
have
only
to
take
account
of
the
notorious
fact
that
the
consciences
of
two
equally
conscientious
men
may
point
in
entirely
opposite
directions
in
order
to
see
that
the
decisions
of
conscience
can
not
at
all
events
be
credited
with
infallibility
those
who
denounce
and
those
who
defend
religious
persecution
those
who
insist
on
the
removal
and
those
who
insist
on
the
retention
of
religious
disabilities
those
who
are
in
favour
of
and
those
who
are
opposed
to
a
relaxation
of
the
marriage
laws
those
who
advocate
a
total
abstention
from
intoxicating
liquors
and
those
who
allow
of
a
moderate
use
of
them
men
on
both
sides
in
these
controversies
or
at
least
the
majority
of
them
doubtless
act
conscientiously
and
yet
as
they
arrive
at
opposite
conclusions
the
conscience
of
one
side
or
other
must
be
at
fault
there
is
no
act
of
religious
persecution
there
are
few
acts
of
political
or
personal
cruelty
for
which
the
authority
of
conscience
might
not
be
invoked
i
doubt
not
that
queen
mary
acted
as
conscientiously
in
burning
the
reformers
as
they
did
in
promulgating
their
opinions
or
we
do
in
condemning
her
acts
it
is
plain
then
not
only
that
the
decisions
of
conscience
are
not
infallible
but
that
they
must
to
a
very
large
extent
be
relative
to
the
circumstances
and
opinions
of
those
who
form
them
in
any
intelligible
or
tenable
sense
of
the
term
conscience
stands
simply
for
the
aggregate
of
our
moral
opinions
reinforced
by
the
moral
sanction
of
or
that
we
ought
to
act
in
accordance
with
these
opinions
and
that
we
are
acting
wrongly
if
we
act
in
opposition
to
them
is
a
truism
conscience
is
the
only
safe
guide
when
the
moment
of
action
has
arrived
but
it
is
equally
important
to
insist
on
the
fallibility
of
conscience
and
to
urge
men
by
all
means
in
their
power
to
be
constantly
improving
and
instructing
their
consciences
or
in
plain
words
to
review
and
wherever
occasion
offers
to
correct
their
conceptions
of
right
and
wrong
the
honest
man
of
bishop
butler
would
undoubtedly
always
follow
his
conscience
but
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
his
conscience
would
always
guide
him
rightly
and
it
is
quite
certain
that
it
would
often
prompt
him
differently
from
the
consciences
of
other
honest
men
trained
elsewhere
and
under
other
circumstances
to
act
contrary
to
our
opinions
of
right
and
wrong
would
be
treason
to
our
moral
nature
but
it
does
not
follow
that
those
opinions
are
not
susceptible
of
improvement
and
correction
or
that
it
is
not
as
much
our
duty
to
take
pains
to
form
true
opinions
as
to
act
in
accordance
with
our
opinions
when
we
have
formed
them
footnote
i
use
the
expressions
sanction
and
sentiment
as
equivalent
terms
because
the
pleasures
and
pains
which
constitute
the
moral
sanction
are
inseparable
even
in
thought
from
the
moral
feeling
the
moral
feeling
of
or
can
not
even
be
conceived
apart
from
the
pleasures
or
pains
which
are
attendant
on
it
and
by
means
of
which
it
reveals
itself
to
us
it
should
be
noticed
that
the
expression
sentiment
is
habitually
used
in
two
senses
as
the
equivalent
of
the
moral
feeling
only
of
the
entire
moral
process
which
as
we
shall
see
in
the
third
chapter
consists
partly
of
a
judgment
partly
of
a
feeling
it
is
in
the
latter
sense
for
instance
that
we
speak
of
the
moral
sentiment
of
any
given
age
or
country
meaning
the
opinions
then
or
there
prevalent
on
moral
questions
reinforced
by
the
feeling
of
approbation
or
disapprobation
as
however
the
moral
feeling
always
follows
immediately
and
necessarily
on
the
moral
judgment
whenever
that
judgment
pronounces
decisively
for
or
against
an
action
and
always
implies
a
previous
judgment
i
am
here
again
obliged
to
anticipate
the
discussion
in
chapter
the
ambiguity
is
of
no
practical
importance
at
the
present
stage
of
our
enquiry
it
is
almost
needless
to
add
that
the
word
when
used
alone
has
the
double
meaning
of
a
feeling
and
an
opinion
an
ambiguity
which
is
sometimes
not
without
practical
inconvenience
the
terms
and
sense
are
very
convenient
expressions
for
popular
use
provided
we
always
bear
in
mind
that
or
your
or
sense
is
quite
as
essential
a
rule
as
your
or
sense
but
the
scientific
moralist
in
attempting
to
analyse
the
springs
of
moral
action
and
to
detect
the
ultimate
sanctions
of
conduct
would
do
well
to
avoid
these
terms
altogether
the
analysis
of
moral
as
well
as
of
intellectual
acts
is
often
only
obscured
by
our
introducing
the
conception
of
and
in
the
present
instance
it
is
far
better
to
confine
ourselves
to
the
expressions
of
or
disapprobation
or
dissatisfaction
which
we
shall
hereafter
attempt
to
analyse
than
to
feign
or
at
least
assume
certain
or
as
distinct
entities
from
which
such
acts
are
supposed
to
proceed
i
shall
therefore
in
the
sequel
of
this
work
say
little
or
nothing
of
or
sense
not
because
i
think
it
desirable
to
banish
those
words
from
popular
terminology
but
because
i
think
that
in
an
attempt
to
present
the
principles
of
ethics
in
a
scientific
form
they
introduce
needless
complexity
and
obscurity
if
the
statements
thus
far
made
in
this
chapter
be
accepted
it
follows
that
the
feelings
of
and
which
constitute
the
moral
sanction
by
no
means
invariably
supervene
on
acts
of
the
same
kind
even
in
the
case
of
the
same
individual
much
less
in
the
case
of
different
individuals
and
that
the
acts
which
elicit
the
moral
sanction
depend
to
a
considerable
extent
on
the
circumstances
and
education
of
the
person
who
passes
judgment
on
them
the
moral
sanction
therefore
though
it
always
consists
in
the
feelings
of
or
of
satisfaction
or
dissatisfaction
at
one
own
acts
is
neither
uniform
absolute
nor
infallible
but
varies
as
applied
not
only
by
different
individuals
but
by
the
same
individual
at
different
times
in
relation
to
varying
conditions
of
education
temperament
nationality
and
generally
of
circumstances
both
external
and
internal
lastly
it
admits
of
constant
improvement
and
correction
how
then
it
may
be
asked
do
we
justify
the
application
of
this
sanction
and
why
do
we
regard
it
as
not
only
a
legitimate
sanction
of
conduct
but
as
the
most
important
of
all
sanctions
and
in
cases
of
conflict
the
supreme
and
final
sanction
the
answer
to
this
question
is
that
if
we
regard
an
action
as
wrong
no
matter
whether
our
opinion
be
correct
or
not
no
external
considerations
whatsoever
can
compensate
us
for
acting
contrary
to
our
convictions
human
nature
in
its
normal
condition
is
so
constituted
that
the
remorse
felt
when
we
look
back
upon
a
wrong
action
far
outweighs
any
pleasure
we
may
have
derived
from
it
just
as
the
satisfaction
with
which
we
look
back
upon
a
right
action
far
more
than
compensates
for
any
pain
with
which
it
may
have
been
attended
the
sibi
conscia
is
the
highest
reward
which
a
man
can
have
as
on
the
other
hand
the
retrospect
on
base
unjust
or
cruel
actions
constitutes
the
most
acute
of
torments
now
when
a
man
looks
back
upon
his
past
actions
what
he
regards
is
not
so
much
the
result
of
his
acts
as
the
intention
and
the
motives
by
which
the
intention
was
actuated
it
is
not
therefore
what
he
would
now
think
of
the
act
so
much
as
what
he
then
thought
of
it
that
is
the
object
of
his
approbation
or
disapprobation
and
consequently
even
though
his
opinions
as
to
the
nature
of
the
act
may
meanwhile
have
undergone
alteration
he
approves
or
disapproves
of
what
was
his
intention
at
the
moment
of
performing
it
and
of
the
state
of
mind
from
which
it
then
proceeded
it
is
true
that
the
subsequent
results
of
our
acts
and
any
change
in
our
estimate
of
their
moral
character
may
considerably
modify
the
feelings
with
which
we
look
back
upon
them
but
still
in
the
main
it
holds
good
that
the
approval
or
disapproval
with
which
we
regard
our
past
conduct
depends
rather
upon
the
opinions
of
right
and
wrong
which
we
entertained
at
the
moment
of
action
than
those
which
we
have
come
to
entertain
since
to
have
acted
at
any
time
in
a
manner
contrary
to
what
we
then
supposed
to
be
right
leaves
behind
it
a
trace
of
dissatisfaction
and
pain
which
may
at
any
future
time
reappear
to
trouble
and
distress
us
just
as
to
have
acted
in
spite
of
all
conflicting
considerations
in
a
manner
which
we
then
conceived
to
be
right
may
in
after
years
be
a
perennial
source
of
pleasure
and
satisfaction
it
is
characteristic
of
the
pleasures
and
pains
of
reflexion
on
our
past
acts
which
pleasures
and
pains
of
reflexion
may
of
course
connect
themselves
with
other
than
purely
moral
considerations
not
only
that
they
admit
of
being
more
intense
than
any
other
pleasures
and
pains
but
that
whenever
there
is
any
conflict
between
the
moral
sanction
and
any
other
sanction
it
is
to
the
moral
sanction
that
they
attach
themselves
thus
if
a
man
has
incurred
physical
suffering
or
braved
the
penalties
of
the
law
or
the
ill
word
of
society
in
pursuance
of
a
course
of
conduct
which
he
deemed
to
be
right
he
looks
back
upon
his
actions
with
satisfaction
and
the
more
important
the
actions
and
the
clearer
his
convictions
of
right
and
the
stronger
the
inducements
to
act
otherwise
the
more
intense
will
his
satisfaction
be
but
no
such
satisfaction
is
felt
when
a
man
has
sacrificed
his
convictions
of
right
to
avoid
physical
pain
or
to
escape
the
penalties
of
the
law
or
to
conciliate
the
goodwill
of
society
the
feeling
on
the
other
hand
will
be
that
of
dissatisfaction
with
himself
varying
according
to
circumstances
from
regret
to
remorse
and
if
no
similar
remark
has
to
be
made
with
reference
to
the
religious
sanction
it
is
because
in
all
the
higher
forms
of
religion
the
religious
sanction
is
conceived
of
as
applying
to
exactly
the
same
actions
as
the
moral
sanction
what
a
man
himself
deems
right
that
he
conceives
god
to
approve
of
and
what
he
conceives
god
as
disapproving
of
that
he
deems
wrong
but
in
a
religion
in
which
god
was
not
regarded
as
holy
just
and
true
or
in
which
there
was
a
plurality
of
gods
some
good
and
some
evil
i
conceive
that
a
man
would
look
back
with
satisfaction
and
not
with
dissatisfaction
on
those
acts
in
which
he
had
followed
his
own
sense
of
right
rather
than
the
supposed
will
of
the
deity
just
as
when
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
two
he
now
congratulates
himself
on
having
submitted
to
the
claims
of
conscience
rather
than
to
those
of
the
law
the
justification
then
of
that
claim
to
superiority
which
is
asserted
by
the
moral
sanction
consists
i
conceive
in
two
circumstances
first
that
the
pleasures
and
pains
the
feelings
of
satisfaction
and
dissatisfaction
of
and
by
means
of
which
it
works
are
in
the
normally
constituted
mind
far
more
intense
and
durable
than
any
other
pleasures
and
pains
secondly
that
whenever
this
sanction
comes
into
conflict
with
any
other
sanction
its
defeat
is
sure
on
a
careful
retrospect
of
our
acts
to
bring
regret
or
remorse
whereas
its
victory
is
equally
certain
to
bring
pleasure
and
satisfaction
we
arrive
then
at
the
conclusion
that
it
is
the
moral
sanction
which
is
the
distinctive
guide
of
conduct
and
to
which
we
must
look
in
the
last
resort
to
enforce
right
action
while
the
other
sanctions
are
mainly
valuable
in
so
far
as
they
reinforce
the
moral
sanction
or
correct
its
aberrations
a
man
must
ultimately
be
the
judge
of
his
own
conduct
and
as
he
acts
or
does
not
act
according
to
his
own
best
judgment
so
he
will
subsequently
feel
satisfaction
or
remorse
but
these
facts
afford
no
reason
why
he
should
not
take
pains
to
inform
his
judgment
by
all
the
means
which
physical
knowledge
law
society
and
religion
place
at
his
disposal
chapter

analysis
and
formation
of
the
moral
sentiment
its
education
and
improvement
before
proceeding
to
our
third
question
namely
how
the
moral
sentiment
which
is
the
source
of
the
moral
sanction
has
been
formed
and
how
it
may
be
further
educated
and
improved
it
is
desirable
to
discriminate
carefully
between
the
intellectual
and
the
emotional
elements
in
an
act
of
approbation
or
disapprobation
we
sometimes
speak
of
moral
judgment
sometimes
of
moral
feeling
these
expressions
ought
not
to
be
regarded
as
the
symbols
of
rival
theories
on
the
nature
of
the
act
of
moral
approbation
as
has
sometimes
been
the
case
but
as
designating
distinct
parts
of
the
process
or
to
put
the
same
statement
rather
differently
separate
elements
in
the
analysis
hume
whose
treatment
of
this
subject
is
peculiarly
lucid
as
compared
with
that
of
most
writers
on
ethics
after
reviewing
the
reasons
assigned
by
those
authors
respectively
who
resolve
the
act
of
approbation
into
an
act
of
judgment
or
an
act
of
feeling
adds
arguments
on
each
side
and
many
more
might
be
produced
are
so
plausible
that
i
am
apt
to
suspect
they
may
the
one
as
well
as
the
other
be
solid
and
satisfactory
and
that
reason
and
sentiment
concur
in
almost
all
moral
determinations
and
conclusions
the
final
sentence
it
is
probable
which
pronounces
characters
and
actions
amiable
or
odious
praiseworthy
or
blameable
that
which
stamps
on
them
the
mark
of
honour
or
infamy
approbation
or
censure
that
which
renders
morality
an
active
principle
and
constitutes
virtue
our
happiness
and
vice
our
misery
it
is
probable
i
say
that
this
final
sentence
depends
on
some
internal
sense
or
feeling
which
nature
has
made
universal
in
the
whole
species
for
what
else
can
have
an
influence
of
this
nature
but
in
order
to
pave
the
way
for
such
a
sentiment
and
give
a
proper
discernment
of
its
object
it
is
often
necessary
we
find
that
much
reasoning
should
precede
that
nice
distinctions
be
made
just
conclusions
drawn
distant
comparisons
formed
complicated
relations
examined
and
general
facts
fixed
and
ascertained
some
species
of
beauty
especially
the
natural
kinds
on
their
first
appearance
command
our
affection
and
approbation
and
where
they
fail
of
this
effect
it
is
impossible
for
any
reasoning
to
redress
their
influence
or
adapt
them
better
to
our
taste
and
sentiment
but
in
many
orders
of
beauty
particularly
those
of
the
finer
arts
it
is
requisite
to
employ
much
reasoning
in
order
to
feel
the
proper
sentiment
and
a
false
relish
may
frequently
be
corrected
by
argument
and
reflexion
there
are
just
grounds
to
conclude
that
moral
beauty
partakes
much
of
this
latter
species
and
demands
the
assistance
of
our
intellectual
faculties
in
order
to
give
it
a
suitable
influence
on
the
human
mind
footnote
enquiry
concerning
the
principles
of
morals
section
i
this
passage
which
i
have
thought
it
worth
while
to
quote
at
length
exhibits
with
sufficient
clearness
the
respective
provinces
of
reason
and
feeling
in
the
ethical
estimation
of
action
whether
we
are
reviewing
the
actions
of
ourselves
or
of
others
what
we
seem
to
do
in
the
first
instance
is
to
refer
them
to
some
class
or
associate
them
with
certain
actions
of
a
similar
kind
which
are
familiar
to
us
and
then
when
their
character
has
thus
been
determined
they
excite
the
appropriate
feeling
of
approbation
or
disapprobation
praise
or
censure
thus
as
soon
as
we
have
realised
that
a
statement
is
a
lie
or
an
act
is
fraudulent
we
at
once
experience
a
feeling
of
indignation
or
disgust
at
the
person
who
has
made
the
statement
or
committed
the
act
and
in
the
same
way
as
soon
as
we
have
recognised
that
an
act
is
brave
or
generous
we
regard
with
esteem
or
admiration
the
doer
of
it
but
though
the
feeling
of
approbation
or
disapprobation
follows
instantaneously
on
the
act
of
judgment
the
recognition
of
the
character
of
the
action
or
its
reference
to
a
class
which
constitutes
this
act
of
judgment
may
be
and
often
is
a
process
of
considerable
length
and
complexity
take
the
case
of
a
lie
what
did
the
man
really
say
in
what
sense
did
he
employ
the
words
used
what
was
the
extent
of
his
knowledge
at
the
time
that
he
made
the
statement
and
what
was
his
intention
these
and
possibly
other
questions
have
to
be
answered
before
we
are
justified
in
accusing
him
of
having
told
a
lie
when
the
offence
is
not
only
a
moral
but
a
legal
one
the
act
of
determining
the
character
of
the
action
in
question
is
often
the
result
of
a
prolonged
enquiry
extending
over
weeks
or
months
no
sooner
however
is
the
intellectual
process
completed
and
the
action
duly
labelled
as
a
lie
or
a
theft
or
a
fraud
or
an
act
of
cruelty
or
ingratitude
or
the
like
than
the
appropriate
ethical
emotion
is
at
once
excited
the
intellectual
process
may
also
be
exceedingly
rapid
or
even
instantaneous
and
always
is
so
when
we
have
no
doubt
as
to
the
nature
either
of
the
action
or
of
the
intention
or
of
the
motives
but
its
characteristic
as
distinguished
from
the
ethical
emotion
is
that
it
may
take
time
and
except
in
perfectly
clear
cases
or
on
very
sudden
emergencies
requiring
subsequent
action
always
ought
to
do
so
we
are
now
in
a
position
to
see
the
source
of
much
confusion
in
the
ordinary
mode
of
speaking
and
writing
on
the
subject
of
the
moral
faculty
the
moral
judgment
the
moral
feeling
the
moral
sense
the
conscience
and
kindred
terms
the
instantaneous
and
the
apparently
instinctive
authoritative
and
absolute
character
of
the
act
of
moral
approbation
or
disapprobation
attaches
to
the
emotional
and
not
to
the
intellectual
part
of
the
process
when
an
action
has
once
been
pronounced
to
be
right
or
wrong
morally
good
or
evil
or
has
been
referred
to
some
class
of
actions
whose
ethical
character
is
already
determined
the
emotion
of
approval
or
disapproval
is
excited
and
follows
as
a
matter
of
course
there
is
no
reasoning
or
hesitation
about
it
simply
because
the
act
is
not
a
reasoning
act
hence
it
appears
to
be
instinctive
and
becomes
invested
with
those
superior
attributes
of
authoritativeness
absoluteness
and
even
infallibility
which
are
not
unnaturally
ascribed
to
an
act
in
which
there
being
no
process
of
reasoning
there
seems
to
be
no
room
for
error
and
indeed
the
feelings
of
moral
approbation
and
disapprobation
can
never
be
properly
described
as
erroneous
though
they
are
frequently
misapplied
the
error
attaches
to
the
preliminary
process
of
reasoning
reference
or
classification
and
if
this
be
wrongly
conducted
there
is
no
justification
for
the
feeling
which
is
consequent
upon
it
but
instead
of
our
asking
for
the
justification
of
the
feeling
in
the
rational
process
which
has
preceded
it
we
often
unconsciously
justify
our
reasoning
by
the
feeling
and
thus
the
whole
process
assumes
the
unreflective
character
which
properly
belongs
only
to
the
emotional
part
of
it
it
is
the
want
of
a
clear
distinction
between
the
logical
process
which
determines
the
character
of
an
act
the
moral
judgment
and
the
emotion
which
immediately
supervenes
when
the
character
of
the
act
is
determined
the
moral
feeling
that
accounts
for
the
exaggerated
epithets
which
are
often
attributed
to
the
operations
of
the
moral
faculty
and
for
the
haste
and
negligence
in
which
men
are
consequently
encouraged
to
indulge
when
arriving
at
their
moral
decisions
let
it
be
recollected
that
when
we
have
time
for
reflexion
we
can
not
take
too
much
pains
in
forming
our
decisions
upon
conduct
for
there
is
always
a
possibility
of
error
in
our
judgments
but
that
when
our
judgments
are
formed
we
ought
to
give
free
scope
to
the
emotions
which
they
naturally
evoke
and
then
we
shall
develope
a
conscience
so
to
speak
at
once
enlightened
and
sensitive
we
shall
combine
accuracy
and
justness
of
judgment
with
delicacy
and
strength
of
feeling
there
remains
the
question
whether
the
feelings
of
approval
and
disapproval
which
supervene
on
our
moral
judgments
admit
of
any
explanation
or
whether
they
are
to
be
regarded
as
ultimate
facts
of
our
mental
constitution
it
seems
to
me
that
on
a
little
reflexion
we
are
led
to
adopt
the
former
alternative
what
are
the
classes
of
acts
under
their
most
general
aspect
which
elicit
the
feelings
of
moral
approbation
and
disapprobation
they
are
such
as
promote
or
tend
to
promote
the
good
either
of
ourselves
or
of
others
now
the
feelings
of
which
these
classes
of
acts
are
the
direct
object
are
respectively
the
and
the
sympathetic
feelings
or
as
they
have
been
somewhat
uncouthly
called
the
egoistic
and
altruistic
feelings
we
have
a
variety
of
appetites
and
desires
which
centre
in
ourselves
including
what
has
been
called
rational
or
a
desire
for
what
on
cool
reflexion
we
conceive
to
be
our
own
highest
good
on
the
whole
as
well
as
or
a
regard
for
our
own
dignity
and
character
and
for
our
own
opinion
of
ourselves
when
any
of
these
various
appetites
or
desires
are
gratified
we
feel
satisfaction
and
on
the
other
hand
when
they
are
thwarted
we
feel
dissatisfaction
similarly
we
have
a
number
of
affections
of
which
others
are
the
object
some
of
them
of
a
malevolent
or
resentful
but
most
of
them
of
a
benevolent
character
including
a
general
desire
to
confer
all
the
happiness
that
we
can
here
again
we
feel
satisfaction
when
our
affections
are
gratified
and
dissatisfaction
when
they
are
thwarted
now
these
feelings
of
satisfaction
and
dissatisfaction
which
are
called
reflex
feelings
because
they
are
reflected
as
it
were
from
the
objects
of
our
desires
include
though
they
are
by
no
means
coextensive
with
the
feelings
of
moral
approbation
and
disapprobation
when
for
instance
we
gratify
the
appetites
of
hunger
or
thirst
or
our
love
of
curiosity
or
power
we
feel
satisfaction
but
we
can
hardly
be
said
to
regard
the
gratification
of
these
appetites
or
feelings
with
moral
approval
or
disapproval
we
perform
thousands
of
acts
and
see
thousands
of
acts
performed
every
day
which
never
excite
any
moral
feeling
whatever
but
there
are
few
men
in
whom
an
undoubted
act
of
kindness
or
generosity
or
resistance
to
temptation
would
not
at
once
elicit
admiration
or
respect
or
if
they
reflected
on
such
acts
in
their
own
case
of
now
what
are
the
circumstances
which
distinguish
these
acts
which
merely
cause
us
satisfaction
from
those
which
elicit
the
moral
feeling
of
approbation
this
question
is
one
by
no
means
easy
to
answer
and
the
solution
of
it
must
obviously
depend
to
some
extent
on
the
moral
surroundings
and
prepossessions
of
the
person
who
undertakes
to
answer
it
but
attempting
to
take
as
wide
a
survey
as
possible
of
those
acts
which
in
different
persons
elicit
moral
approbation
or
disapprobation
i
will
endeavour
to
discriminate
the
characteristics
which
they
have
in
common
all
those
acts
then
it
seems
to
me
which
elicit
a
distinctively
moral
feeling
have
been
the
result
of
some
conflict
amongst
the
various
desires
and
affections
or
to
adopt
the
more
ordinary
phraseology
of
a
conflict
of
motives
we
neither
approve
nor
disapprove
of
acts
with
regard
to
which
there
seems
to
have
been
little
or
no
choice
which
appear
to
have
resulted
naturally
from
the
circumstances
thus
if
a
man
pays
his
debts
promptly
or
a
man
of
known
poverty
asks
to
have
the
time
of
payment
deferred
we
neither
visit
the
one
with
praise
nor
the
other
with
censure
though
if
their
conduct
were
reversed
we
should
censure
the
former
and
praise
the
latter
the
reason
of
this
difference
of
treatment
is
plain
there
is
not
or
at
least
need
not
be
any
conflict
in
the
case
of
the
man
between
his
own
convenience
or
any
reasonable
gratification
of
his
desires
and
the
satisfaction
of
a
just
claim
hence
in
paying
the
debt
promptly
he
is
only
acting
as
we
might
expect
him
to
act
and
his
conduct
excites
no
moral
feeling
on
our
part
though
if
he
were
to
act
differently
he
would
incur
our
censure
the
poor
man
on
the
other
hand
must
have
put
himself
to
some
inconvenience
and
exercised
some
in
order
to
meet
his
engagement
at
the
exact
time
at
which
the
payment
became
due
and
hence
he
merits
our
praise
though
if
he
had
acted
otherwise
the
circumstances
might
have
excused
him
another
characteristic
of
acts
which
we
praise
or
blame
in
the
case
of
others
or
approve
or
disapprove
on
reflexion
in
our
own
case
seems
to
be
that
they
must
possess
some
importance
the
great
majority
of
our
acts
are
too
trivial
to
merit
any
notice
such
as
is
implied
in
a
moral
judgment
when
a
man
makes
way
for
another
in
the
street
or
refrains
from
eating
or
drinking
more
than
is
good
for
him
neither
he
nor
the
bystander
probably
ever
thinks
of
regarding
the
act
as
a
meritorious
one
it
is
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
though
the
opposite
conduct
might
under
certain
circumstances
be
of
sufficient
importance
to
incur
censure
it
is
impossible
here
as
in
most
other
cases
where
we
speak
of
to
draw
a
definite
line
but
it
may
at
least
be
laid
down
that
an
act
in
order
to
be
regarded
as
moral
or
immoral
must
be
of
sufficient
importance
to
arrest
attention
and
stimulate
reflexion
thus
far
then
we
have
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
acts
which
are
the
objects
of
moral
approbation
and
disapprobation
must
have
a
certain
importance
and
must
be
the
result
of
a
certain
amount
of
conflict
between
different
motives
but
we
have
not
as
yet
attempted
to
detect
any
principle
of
discrimination
between
those
acts
which
are
the
objects
of
praise
or
approbation
and
those
which
are
the
objects
of
censure
or
disapprobation
now
it
seems
to
me
that
such
a
principle
may
be
found
in
the
fact
that
all
those
acts
of
others
which
we
praise
or
those
acts
of
ourselves
which
on
reflexion
we
approve
involve
some
amount
of
sacrifice
whereas
all
those
acts
of
others
which
we
blame
or
those
acts
of
ourselves
which
on
reflexion
we
disapprove
involve
some
amount
of
the
conflict
is
between
a
man
own
lower
and
higher
good
or
between
his
own
good
and
the
greater
good
of
others
or
in
certain
cases
as
we
shall
see
presently
between
the
lesser
good
of
some
reinforced
by
considerations
of
or
partiality
and
the
greater
good
of
others
not
so
reinforced
or
even
occasionally
between
the
pleasure
or
advantage
of
others
and
a
disproportionate
injury
to
himself
and
he
who
in
the
struggle
gives
the
preference
to
the
former
of
these
motives
usually
becomes
the
object
of
censure
or
on
reflexion
of
while
he
who
gives
the
preference
to
the
latter
becomes
the
object
of
praise
or
on
reflexion
of
i
shall
endeavour
to
illustrate
this
position
by
a
few
instances
mostly
taken
from
common
life
we
praise
a
man
who
by
due
economy
makes
decent
provision
for
himself
in
old
age
as
we
blame
a
man
who
fails
to
do
so
quite
apart
from
any
public
or
social
considerations
we
admire
and
applaud
in
the
one
man
the
power
of
and
the
habit
of
foresight
which
enable
him
to
subordinate
his
immediate
gratifications
to
his
larger
interests
in
the
remote
future
and
to
forego
sensual
and
passing
pleasures
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
his
and
personal
independence
in
later
life
and
we
admire
and
applaud
him
still
more
if
to
these
purely
considerations
he
adds
the
social
one
of
wishing
to
avoid
becoming
a
burden
on
his
family
or
his
friends
or
the
public
just
in
the
same
way
we
condemn
the
other
man
who
rather
than
sacrifice
his
immediate
gratification
will
incur
the
risk
of
forfeiting
his
and
independence
in
after
years
as
well
as
of
making
others
suffer
for
his
improvidence
a
man
who
by
the
exercise
of
similar
economy
and
forethought
makes
provision
for
his
family
or
relations
we
esteem
still
more
than
the
man
who
simply
makes
provision
for
himself
because
the
sacrifice
of
passing
pleasures
is
generally
still
greater
and
because
there
is
also
in
this
case
a
total
sacrifice
of
all
interests
except
perhaps
and
reputation
for
the
sake
of
others
similarly
the
man
who
has
a
family
or
relations
dependent
upon
him
and
who
neglects
to
make
future
provision
for
them
deservedly
incurs
our
censure
far
more
than
the
man
who
merely
neglects
to
make
provision
for
himself
because
his
has
to
contend
against
the
full
force
of
the
social
as
well
as
the
higher
motives
and
its
persistence
is
therefore
the
less
excusable
i
will
next
take
the
familiar
case
of
a
trust
voluntarily
undertaken
but
involving
considerable
trouble
to
the
trustee
a
case
of
a
much
more
complicated
character
than
the
last
if
the
trustee
altogether
neglects
or
does
not
devote
a
reasonable
amount
of
attention
to
the
affairs
of
the
trust
there
is
no
doubt
that
besides
any
legal
penalties
which
he
may
incur
he
merits
moral
censure
rather
than
sacrifice
his
own
ease
or
his
own
interests
he
violates
the
obligation
which
he
has
undertaken
and
brings
inconvenience
or
possibly
disaster
to
those
whose
interests
he
has
bound
himself
to
protect
but
the
demands
of
the
trust
may
become
so
excessive
as
to
tax
the
time
and
pains
of
the
trustee
to
a
far
greater
extent
than
could
ever
have
been
anticipated
and
to
interfere
seriously
with
his
other
employments
in
this
case
no
reasonable
person
i
presume
would
censure
the
trustee
for
endeavouring
even
at
some
inconvenience
or
expense
to
the
persons
for
whose
benefit
the
trust
existed
to
release
himself
from
his
obligation
or
to
devolve
part
of
the
work
on
a
professional
adviser
while
however
the
work
connected
with
the
trust
did
not
interfere
with
other
obligations
or
with
the
promotion
of
the
welfare
of
others
no
one
i
imagine
would
censure
the
trustee
for
continuing
to
perform
it
to
his
own
inconvenience
or
disadvantage
if
he
chose
to
do
so
his
neighbours
might
perhaps
say
that
he
was
foolish
but
they
would
hardly
go
to
the
length
of
saying
that
he
acted
wrongly
neither
on
the
other
hand
would
they
be
likely
to
praise
him
as
the
sacrifice
he
was
undergoing
would
be
out
of
proportion
to
the
good
attained
by
it
and
the
interests
of
others
to
which
he
was
postponing
his
own
interests
would
not
be
so
distinctly
greater
as
to
warrant
the
act
of
but
now
let
us
suppose
that
in
attending
to
the
interests
of
the
trust
he
is
neglecting
the
interests
of
others
who
have
a
claim
upon
him
or
impairing
his
own
efficiency
as
a
public
servant
or
a
professional
man
if
the
interests
thus
at
stake
were
plainly
much
greater
than
those
of
the
trust
as
they
might
well
be
the
attitude
of
neutrality
would
soon
be
converted
into
one
of
positive
censure
unless
he
took
means
to
extricate
himself
from
the
difficulty
in
which
he
was
placed
the
supposition
just
made
illustrates
the
fact
that
the
moral
feelings
may
attach
themselves
not
only
to
cases
in
which
the
collision
is
between
a
man
own
higher
and
lower
good
or
between
his
own
good
and
that
of
another
but
also
to
those
in
which
the
competition
is
entirely
between
the
good
of
others
it
may
be
worth
while
to
illustrate
this
last
class
of
cases
by
one
or
two
additional
examples
a
man
tells
a
lie
in
order
to
screen
a
friend
the
act
is
a
purely
social
one
for
he
stands
in
no
fear
of
his
friend
and
expects
no
return
it
might
be
said
that
the
competition
in
this
example
is
between
serving
his
friend
and
wounding
his
own
but
the
consciousness
of
cowardice
and
meanness
which
attends
a
lie
spoken
in
a
man
own
interest
hardly
attaches
to
a
lie
spoken
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
another
and
any
way
a
little
reflexion
might
show
that
the
apparently
benevolent
intention
comes
into
collision
with
a
very
extensive
and
very
stringent
social
obligation
that
of
not
impairing
our
confidence
in
one
assertions
without
maintaining
that
there
are
no
conceivable
circumstances
under
which
a
man
would
be
justified
in
committing
a
breach
of
veracity
it
may
at
least
be
said
that
in
the
lives
of
most
men
there
is
not
likely
to
occur
any
case
in
which
the
greater
social
good
would
not
be
attained
by
the
observation
of
the
general
rule
to
tell
the
truth
rather
than
by
the
recognition
of
an
exception
in
favour
of
a
lie
even
though
that
lie
were
told
for
purely
benevolent
reasons
in
all
those
circumstances
in
which
there
is
a
keen
sense
of
comradeship
as
at
school
or
college
or
in
the
army
or
navy
this
is
a
principle
which
requires
to
be
constantly
kept
in
view
and
to
be
constantly
enforced
the
not
infrequent
breach
of
it
under
such
circumstances
affords
a
striking
illustration
of
the
manner
in
which
the
laws
of
honour
spoken
of
in
the
first
chapter
occasionally
the
wider
social
sentiment
and
even
the
dictates
of
personal
morality
de
is
doubtless
a
noble
sentiment
and
on
the
whole
productive
of
much
good
but
when
it
comes
into
collision
with
the
more
general
rules
of
morality
its
effects
are
simply
pernicious
i
will
next
take
an
example
of
the
conflict
between
two
impulses
each
having
for
its
object
the
good
of
others
from
the
very
familiar
case
of
a
man
having
to
appoint
to
or
vote
in
the
election
to
a
vacant
office
or
situation
the
interests
of
the
public
service
or
of
some
institution
require
that
the
most
competent
candidate
should
be
preferred
but
a
relative
or
a
friend
or
a
political
ally
is
standing
affection
therefore
or
friendship
or
loyalty
to
party
ties
often
dictates
one
course
of
conduct
and
regard
for
the
public
interests
another
when
the
case
is
thus
plainly
stated
there
are
probably
few
men
who
would
seriously
maintain
that
we
ought
to
subordinate
the
wider
to
the
narrower
considerations
and
still
in
practice
there
are
few
men
who
have
the
courage
to
act
constantly
on
what
is
surely
the
right
principle
in
this
matter
and
what
is
worse
still
even
if
they
did
they
would
not
always
be
sustained
by
public
opinion
while
they
would
be
almost
certain
to
be
condemned
by
the
circle
in
which
they
move
so
frequently
do
the
difficulties
of
this
position
recur
that
i
have
often
heard
a
shrewd
friend
observe
that
no
man
who
was
fit
for
the
exercise
of
patronage
would
ever
desire
to
be
entrusted
with
it
the
moral
rule
in
ordinary
cases
is
plain
enough
it
is
to
appoint
or
vote
for
the
candidate
who
is
most
competent
to
fulfil
the
duties
of
the
post
to
be
filled
up
there
are
exceptional
cases
in
which
it
may
be
allowable
slightly
to
modify
this
rule
as
where
it
is
desirable
to
encourage
particular
services
or
particular
nationalities
or
the
like
but
even
in
these
cases
the
rule
of
superior
competency
ought
to
be
the
preponderating
consideration
parliamentary
and
in
a
lesser
degree
municipal
elections
of
course
form
a
class
apart
here
in
the
selection
of
candidates
within
the
party
superior
competency
ought
to
be
the
guiding
consideration
but
in
the
election
itself
the
main
object
being
to
promote
or
prevent
the
passing
of
certain
public
measures
the
elector
quite
rightly
votes
for
those
who
will
give
effect
to
his
opinions
irrespectively
of
personal
qualifications
though
even
in
these
cases
there
might
be
an
amount
of
unfitness
which
would
warrant
neutrality
or
opposition
peculiarly
perplexing
cases
of
competition
between
the
rival
claims
of
others
sometimes
occur
in
the
domain
of
the
resentful
feelings
which
in
their
purified
and
rationalised
form
constitute
the
sense
of
justice
my
servant
or
a
friend
or
a
relative
has
committed
a
theft
shall
i
prosecute
him
a
general
regard
to
the
public
welfare
undoubtedly
demands
that
i
should
do
so
there
are
few
obligations
more
imperative
on
the
individual
citizen
than
that
of
denouncing
and
prosecuting
crime
but
in
the
present
case
there
is
the
personal
tie
involving
the
obligation
of
protection
and
assistance
this
tie
obviously
must
count
for
something
as
a
rival
consideration
no
man
except
under
the
most
extreme
circumstances
would
prosecute
his
wife
or
his
father
or
his
mother
the
question
then
is
how
far
this
consideration
is
to
count
against
the
other
and
much
must
evidently
depend
on
the
degree
of
relationship
or
of
previous
intimacy
the
time
and
amount
and
kind
of
service
and
the
like
a
similar
conflict
of
motives
arises
when
the
punishment
invoked
would
entail
the
culprit
ruin
or
that
of
his
wife
or
family
or
others
who
are
dependent
upon
him
it
is
impossible
in
cases
of
this
kind
to
lay
down
beforehand
any
strict
rules
of
conduct
and
the
rectitude
of
the
decision
must
largely
turn
on
the
experience
skill
and
honesty
of
the
person
who
attempts
to
resolve
the
difficulty
instances
of
the
last
division
where
the
conflict
is
between
the
pleasure
or
advantage
of
others
and
a
disproportionate
injury
to
oneself
are
of
comparatively
infrequent
occurrence
it
is
not
often
that
a
man
hesitates
sufficiently
between
his
own
manifest
disadvantage
and
the
small
gains
or
pleasures
of
his
neighbours
to
make
this
class
of
cases
of
much
importance
to
the
moralist
as
a
rule
we
may
be
trusted
to
take
care
of
ourselves
and
other
people
credit
us
sufficiently
with
this
capacity
not
to
trade
very
much
upon
the
weakness
of
mere
however
much
they
may
trade
upon
our
ignorance
and
folly
the
most
familiar
example
perhaps
of
acts
of
imprudence
of
the
kind
here
contemplated
is
to
be
found
in
the
facility
with
which
some
people
yield
to
social
temptations
as
where
they
drink
too
much
or
bet
or
play
cards
when
they
know
that
they
will
most
likely
lose
their
money
out
of
a
feeling
of
mere
good
fellowship
or
where
from
the
mere
desire
to
amuse
others
they
give
parties
which
are
beyond
their
means
the
gravest
example
is
to
be
found
in
certain
cases
of
seduction
instances
of
men
making
large
and
imprudent
sacrifices
of
money
for
inadequate
objects
are
very
rare
and
are
rather
designated
as
foolish
than
wrong
with
regard
to
all
the
failings
and
offences
which
fall
under
this
head
it
may
be
remarked
that
from
their
false
show
of
generosity
society
is
apt
to
treat
them
too
venially
except
where
they
entail
degradation
or
disgrace
if
it
be
asked
how
actions
of
this
kind
seeing
that
they
are
done
out
of
some
regard
to
others
can
be
described
as
involving
or
the
resistance
to
them
can
be
looked
on
in
the
light
of
sacrifice
it
may
be
replied
that
the
conflict
is
between
a
feeling
of
sociality
or
a
spirit
of
or
the
like
on
the
one
side
and
a
man
or
a
regard
to
his
own
highest
interests
on
the
other
and
that
some
natures
find
it
much
easier
to
yield
to
the
former
than
to
maintain
the
latter
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
spirit
of
sacrifice
may
be
exhibited
in
the
maintenance
against
temptation
of
a
man
own
higher
interests
and
the
spirit
of
in
weakly
yielding
to
a
perverted
sympathy
or
an
exaggerated
regard
for
the
opinions
of
others
before
concluding
this
chapter
there
are
a
few
objections
to
be
met
and
explanations
to
be
made
in
the
first
place
it
may
be
objected
that
the
theory
i
have
adopted
that
the
moral
feeling
is
excited
only
where
there
has
been
a
conflict
of
motives
runs
counter
to
the
ordinary
view
that
acts
proceeding
from
a
virtuous
or
vicious
habit
are
done
without
any
struggle
and
almost
without
any
consciousness
of
their
import
i
do
not
at
all
deny
that
a
habit
may
become
so
perfect
that
the
acts
proceeding
from
it
cease
to
involve
any
struggle
between
conflicting
motives
but
in
this
case
i
conceive
that
our
approbation
or
disapprobation
is
transferred
from
the
individual
acts
to
the
habit
from
which
they
spring
and
that
what
we
really
applaud
or
condemn
is
the
character
rather
than
the
actions
or
at
least
the
actions
simply
as
indicative
of
the
character
and
the
reason
that
we
often
praise
or
blame
acts
proceeding
from
habit
more
than
acts
proceeding
from
momentary
impulse
is
that
we
associate
such
acts
with
a
good
or
evil
character
as
the
case
may
be
and
therefore
include
the
character
as
well
as
the
acts
in
the
judgment
which
we
pass
upon
them
it
may
possibly
have
occurred
to
the
reader
that
in
the
latter
part
of
this
chapter
i
have
been
somewhat
inconsistent
in
referring
usually
to
the
social
sanction
of
praise
and
blame
rather
than
to
the
distinctively
moral
sanction
of
and
i
have
employed
this
language
solely
for
the
sake
of
convenience
and
to
avoid
the
cumbrous
phraseology
which
the
employment
of
the
other
phrases
would
sometimes
have
occasioned
in
a
civilized
and
educated
community
the
social
sentiment
may
on
almost
all
points
except
those
which
involve
obscure
or
delicate
considerations
of
morality
be
taken
to
be
identical
with
the
moral
sentiment
of
the
most
reflective
members
of
the
society
and
hence
in
the
tolerably
obvious
instances
which
i
have
selected
there
was
no
need
to
draw
any
distinction
between
the
two
and
i
have
felt
myself
at
liberty
to
be
guided
purely
by
considerations
of
convenience
all
that
i
have
said
of
the
praise
or
blame
the
applause
or
censure
of
others
of
course
admits
of
being
transferred
to
the
feelings
with
which
on
reflexion
we
regard
our
own
acts
i
am
aware
that
the
expressions
and
lower
good
and
lesser
good
are
more
or
less
vague
but
the
traditional
acceptation
of
the
terms
sufficiently
fixes
their
meaning
to
enable
them
to
serve
as
a
guide
to
moral
conduct
and
moral
feeling
especially
when
modified
by
the
experience
and
reflexion
of
men
who
have
given
habitual
attention
to
the
working
of
their
own
motives
and
the
results
of
their
own
practice
as
i
shall
shew
in
the
next
chapter
any
terms
which
we
employ
to
designate
the
test
of
moral
action
and
the
objects
of
the
moral
feeling
are
indefinite
and
must
depend
to
some
extent
on
the
subjective
interpretation
of
the
individual
all
that
we
can
do
is
to
avail
ourselves
of
the
most
adequate
and
intelligible
terms
that
we
can
find
but
admitting
the
necessary
indefiniteness
of
the
terms
it
may
be
asked
whether
it
can
really
be
meant
as
a
general
proposition
that
the
praise
of
others
and
our
approbation
of
ourselves
on
reflexion
attach
to
acts
in
which
we
subordinate
our
own
good
to
the
greater
good
of
others
however
slight
the
preponderance
of
our
neighbour
good
over
out
own
may
be
if
we
have
to
undergo
an
almost
equal
risk
in
order
to
save
another
or
in
order
to
promote
another
interests
to
forego
interests
almost
as
great
is
not
our
conduct
more
properly
designated
as
weak
or
quixotic
than
noble
or
generous
this
would
not
i
think
be
the
answer
of
mankind
at
large
to
the
question
or
that
of
any
person
whose
moral
sentiments
had
been
developed
under
healthy
influences
when
a
man
at
the
risk
of
his
own
life
saves
another
from
drowning
or
at
a
similar
risk
protects
his
comrade
in
battle
or
rushing
into
the
midst
of
a
fire
attempts
to
rescue
the
helpless
victims
surely
the
feeling
of
the
bystanders
is
that
of
admiration
and
not
of
pity
or
contempt
when
a
man
with
his
life
in
his
hands
goes
forth
on
a
missionary
or
a
philanthropic
enterprise
like
xavier
or
henry
martyn
or
howard
or
livingstone
or
patteson
or
when
a
man
like
frederick
vyner
insists
on
transferring
his
own
chance
of
escape
from
a
murderous
gang
of
brigands
to
his
married
friend
humanity
at
large
rightly
regards
itself
as
his
debtor
and
ordinary
men
feel
that
their
very
nature
has
been
ennobled
and
exalted
by
his
example
but
it
is
not
only
these
acts
of
widely
recognised
heroism
that
exact
a
response
from
mankind
in
many
a
domestic
circle
there
are
men
and
women
who
habitually
sacrifice
their
own
ease
and
comfort
to
the
needs
of
an
aged
or
sick
or
helpless
relative
and
surely
it
is
not
with
scorn
for
their
weakness
that
their
neighbours
who
know
their
privations
regard
them
but
with
sympathy
and
respect
for
their
patience
and
the
pecuniary
risks
and
sacrifices
which
men
are
ready
to
make
for
one
another
in
the
shape
of
sureties
and
bonds
and
loans
and
gifts
are
familiar
to
us
all
and
though
these
are
often
unscrupulously
wrung
from
a
thoughtless
or
yet
there
are
many
instances
in
which
men
knowingly
deliberately
and
at
considerable
danger
or
loss
to
themselves
postpone
their
own
security
or
convenience
to
the
protection
or
relief
of
their
friends
it
is
in
cases
of
this
kind
perhaps
that
the
line
between
weakness
and
generosity
is
most
difficult
to
draw
and
where
a
man
has
others
dependent
on
him
for
assistance
or
support
the
weakness
which
yields
to
the
solicitations
of
a
reckless
or
unscrupulous
friend
may
become
positively
culpable
the
last
class
of
instances
will
be
sufficient
to
shew
that
it
is
not
always
easy
to
determine
where
the
good
of
others
is
greater
than
our
own
nor
is
it
ever
possible
to
determine
this
question
with
mathematical
exactness
men
may
therefore
be
at
least
excused
if
before
sacrificing
their
own
interests
or
pleasures
they
require
that
the
good
of
others
for
which
they
make
the
sacrifice
shall
be
plainly
preponderant
and
even
then
there
is
a
wide
margin
between
the
acts
which
we
praise
for
their
heroism
or
generosity
or
and
those
which
we
condemn
for
their
baseness
or
meanness
or
selfishness
it
must
never
be
forgotten
in
the
treatment
of
questions
of
morality
that
there
is
a
large
number
of
acts
which
we
neither
praise
nor
blame
and
this
is
emphatically
the
case
where
the
competition
is
between
a
man
own
interests
and
those
of
his
neighbours
we
applaud
generosity
we
censure
meanness
but
there
is
a
large
intermediate
class
of
acts
which
can
neither
be
designated
as
generous
nor
mean
it
will
be
observed
that
in
my
enumeration
of
the
classes
of
acts
to
which
praise
and
blame
and
attach
i
have
carefully
drawn
a
distinction
between
the
invariable
connexion
which
obtains
between
certain
acts
and
the
ethical
approval
of
ourselves
or
others
and
the
only
general
connexion
which
obtains
between
the
omission
of
those
acts
and
the
ethical
feeling
of
disapproval
simply
to
fall
short
of
the
ethical
standard
which
we
approve
neither
merits
nor
receives
censure
though
there
is
a
degree
of
deficiency
determined
roughly
by
society
at
large
and
by
each
individual
for
himself
at
which
this
indifference
is
converted
into
positive
condemnation
a
like
neutral
zone
of
acts
which
we
neither
applaud
nor
condemn
of
course
exists
also
in
the
case
of
acts
which
simply
affect
ourselves
or
simply
affect
others
though
it
does
not
seem
to
be
so
extensive
as
in
the
case
where
the
conflict
of
motives
is
between
the
interests
of
others
and
those
of
ourselves
in
determining
the
cases
in
which
we
shall
subordinate
our
own
interests
to
those
of
others
or
do
good
to
others
at
our
own
risk
or
loss
it
is
essential
that
we
should
take
account
of
the
remote
as
well
as
the
immediate
effects
of
actions
and
moreover
that
we
should
enquire
into
their
general
tendencies
or
in
other
words
ask
ourselves
what
would
happen
if
everybody
or
many
people
acted
as
we
propose
to
act
thus
at
first
sight
it
might
seem
as
if
a
rich
man
at
a
comparatively
small
sacrifice
to
himself
might
promote
the
greater
good
of
his
poor
neighbours
by
distributing
amongst
them
what
to
them
would
be
considerable
sums
of
money
if
i
have
ten
thousand
a
year
why
should
i
not
make
fifty
poor
families
happy
by
endowing
them
with
a
hundred
a
year
each
which
to
them
would
be
a
handsome
competency
the
loss
of
five
thousand
a
year
would
be
to
me
simply
an
abridgment
of
superfluous
luxuries
which
i
could
soon
learn
to
dispense
with
while
to
them
the
gain
of
a
hundred
a
year
would
be
the
substitution
of
comfort
for
penury
and
of
case
for
perpetual
struggle
the
answer
is
that
in
the
first
place
i
should
probably
not
in
the
long
run
be
making
these
families
really
happy
the
change
of
circumstances
would
undoubtedly
confer
considerable
pleasure
while
it
continued
to
be
a
novelty
but
their
improved
circumstances
when
they
became
accustomed
to
them
would
soon
be
by
the
produced
by
want
of
employment
while
the
motive
to
exertion
being
removed
and
the
taste
for
luxuries
stimulated
they
or
the
next
generation
would
probably
lapse
again
into
poverty
which
would
be
all
the
more
keenly
felt
for
their
temporary
enjoyment
of
prosperity
moreover
i
should
be
injuring
the
community
at
large
by
withdrawing
a
number
of
persons
from
industrial
employments
and
transferring
them
to
the
classes
again
if
the
five
thousand
a
year
were
withdrawn
not
from
my
personal
expenditure
but
from
industrial
enterprises
in
which
i
was
engaged
i
should
be
actually
depriving
the
families
of
many
workmen
and
artisans
of
the
fruits
of
their
honest
labour
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
a
smaller
number
of
families
to
live
in
sloth
and
indolence
but
now
suppose
the
case
i
have
imagined
to
become
a
general
one
and
that
it
was
a
common
occurrence
for
rich
men
to
dispense
their
superfluous
wealth
amongst
their
poorer
neighbours
without
demanding
any
return
in
labour
or
services
the
result
would
inevitably
be
the
creation
of
a
large
class
of
idle
persons
who
would
probably
soon
become
a
torment
to
themselves
while
their
descendants
often
brought
up
to
no
employment
and
with
an
insufficient
income
to
support
them
would
probably
lapse
into
pauperism
the
effect
on
the
community
at
large
if
the
evil
became
widely
spread
would
be
the
paralysis
of
trade
and
commerce
of
course
i
am
aware
that
these
evils
would
be
to
a
certain
extent
modified
in
practice
by
the
good
sense
of
the
recipients
some
of
whom
might
employ
their
money
on
reproductive
industries
instead
of
on
merely
furnishing
themselves
with
the
means
of
living
at
their
ease
but
that
the
general
tendency
would
be
that
which
i
have
intimated
no
one
i
think
who
is
acquainted
with
the
indolent
propensities
of
human
nature
can
well
doubt
similar
results
might
be
shewn
to
follow
from
an
indiscriminate
distribution
of
charity
on
a
smaller
scale
it
seems
to
refuse
a
shilling
to
a
beggar
or
a
guinea
to
a
charitable
association
when
one
would
hardly
miss
the
sum
at
the
end
of
the
week
or
the
month
but
if
we
could
trace
all
the
consequences
direct
and
remote
of
these
apparent
acts
of
benevolence
we
should
often
see
that
the
small
act
of
sacrifice
on
our
own
part
was
by
no
means
efficacious
in
promoting
the
good
of
the
recipient
and
still
less
of
society
at
large
a
life
of
vagrancy
or
indolence
may
easily
be
made
more
attractive
than
one
of
honest
industry
and
efforts
to
anticipate
all
the
wants
and
misfortunes
of
the
poor
may
often
have
the
effect
of
making
them
careless
of
the
future
and
of
destroying
all
elements
of
independence
and
providence
in
their
character
another
instance
of
the
contrast
between
the
immediate
and
remote
or
apparent
and
real
results
of
acts
of
intended
beneficence
is
to
be
found
in
the
prodigality
with
which
persons
often
distribute
gratuities
amongst
servants
these
gratuities
have
the
immediate
effect
of
giving
gratification
to
the
recipients
and
securing
better
service
to
the
donors
but
they
have
often
the
remote
and
more
permanent
effect
of
rendering
the
recipients
servile
and
corrupt
and
as
in
the
case
of
railway
porters
of
depriving
poorer
or
less
prodigal
persons
of
services
to
which
they
are
equally
entitled
in
adducing
these
illustrations
i
must
not
be
understood
to
be
advocating
or
defending
a
selfish
employment
of
superfluous
wealth
but
to
be
shewing
the
evils
which
may
result
from
an
unenlightened
benevolence
and
the
importance
of
ascertaining
that
the
good
of
others
to
which
we
sacrifice
our
own
interests
or
enjoyments
is
a
real
and
not
merely
an
apparent
good
and
moreover
that
our
conduct
if
it
became
general
would
promote
the
welfare
of
the
community
at
large
and
not
merely
particular
sections
of
it
to
the
injury
of
the
rest
to
sum
up
the
results
of
this
chapter
we
may
repeat
that
we
must
distinguish
carefully
between
the
intellectual
act
of
moral
judgment
or
the
judgment
we
pass
on
matters
of
conduct
and
the
emotional
act
of
moral
feeling
or
the
feeling
which
supervenes
upon
that
judgment
and
that
so
far
as
we
can
give
a
precise
definition
of
the
latter
it
is
an
indirect
or
reflex
form
of
one
or
other
of
the
sympathetic
resentful
or
feelings
occurring
when
on
consideration
we
realise
that
in
matters
involving
a
conflict
of
motives
and
of
sufficient
importance
to
arrest
our
attention
and
stimulate
our
reflexion
one
or
other
of
these
feelings
has
been
gratified
or
thwarted
moreover
that
we
praise
in
the
case
of
others
and
approve
in
our
own
case
all
those
actions
of
the
above
kind
in
which
a
man
subordinates
his
own
lower
to
his
higher
good
or
his
own
good
to
the
greater
good
of
others
or
when
the
interests
only
of
others
are
at
stake
the
lesser
good
of
some
to
the
greater
good
of
others
as
well
as
under
certain
circumstances
those
actions
in
which
he
refuses
to
subordinate
his
own
greater
good
to
the
lesser
good
of
others
while
we
blame
in
the
case
of
others
and
disapprove
in
our
own
case
all
those
actions
of
the
above
kind
in
which
he
manifestly
and
distinctly
for
there
is
a
large
neutral
zone
of
actions
which
we
neither
applaud
nor
condemn
subordinates
his
own
higher
to
his
lower
good
or
the
greater
good
of
others
to
his
own
lesser
good
or
where
the
interests
only
of
others
are
at
stake
the
greater
good
of
some
to
the
lesser
good
of
others
or
lastly
under
certain
circumstances
the
lesser
good
of
others
to
the
greater
good
of
himself
especially
where
that
greater
good
is
the
good
of
his
higher
nature
even
at
the
present
stage
of
our
enquiry
it
must
be
tolerably
evident
to
the
reader
that
moral
progress
if
such
a
fact
exist
will
be
due
mainly
to
the
increasing
accuracy
and
the
extended
applications
of
our
moral
judgments
or
in
other
words
to
the
development
of
the
rational
rather
than
the
emotional
element
in
the
ethical
act
the
moral
feeling
follows
on
the
moral
judgment
and
awards
praise
or
blame
experiences
satisfaction
or
dissatisfaction
in
accordance
with
the
intellectual
decisions
which
have
preceded
it
the
character
of
the
feeling
therefore
as
distinct
from
its
intensity
is
already
determined
for
it
by
a
previous
process
and
its
intensity
is
undoubtedly
greater
amongst
primitive
and
uneducated
men
than
it
is
in
civilized
life
amongst
ourselves
not
only
are
the
feelings
of
approbation
and
disapprobation
themselves
largely
modified
by
the
account
we
take
of
mixed
motives
qualifying
circumstances
and
the
like
but
the
expression
of
them
is
still
further
restrained
by
the
caution
which
the
civilized
man
habitually
practises
in
the
presence
of
others
indeed
great
in
many
respects
as
are
the
advantages
of
this
moderation
and
restraint
there
is
a
certain
danger
that
as
civilisation
advances
the
approval
of
virtue
and
the
disapproval
of
vice
may
cease
to
be
expressed
in
sufficiently
plain
and
emphatic
terms
but
on
the
other
hand
with
the
extension
of
experience
and
the
discipline
of
the
intellectual
faculties
the
moral
judgment
we
may
already
presume
for
the
confirmation
of
this
presumption
i
must
refer
to
the
next
chapter
will
always
be
growing
in
accuracy
receiving
further
applications
and
becoming
a
more
and
more
adequate
representative
of
facts
the
analysis
therefore
of
the
moral
act
with
which
we
have
been
mainly
engaged
in
the
foregoing
chapter
besides
being
essential
to
the
determination
of
any
theoretical
problem
of
ethics
has
a
most
important
practical
bearing
from
the
indication
which
it
affords
of
the
direction
in
which
moral
progress
is
in
the
future
most
likely
to
be
found
it
must
never
be
forgotten
however
that
men
may
know
what
is
right
and
do
what
is
wrong
and
hence
the
due
stimulation
of
the
moral
emotions
so
that
they
may
respond
to
the
improved
moral
judgments
is
at
once
an
indispensable
branch
of
moral
education
and
an
indispensable
condition
of
moral
progress
but
this
is
the
function
not
so
much
of
the
scientific
moralist
as
of
the
parent
the
instructor
of
youth
the
poet
the
dramatist
the
novelist
the
journalist
the
artist
and
above
all
of
the
religious
teacher
chapter
iv
the
moral
test
and
its
justification
the
moral
feeling
as
we
have
seen
follows
immediately
and
necessarily
on
the
moral
judgment
but
what
considerations
guide
the
moral
judgment
our
moral
judgments
as
we
have
also
seen
are
the
result
of
a
logical
process
of
reference
to
a
class
or
of
association
with
similars
this
particular
action
is
like
certain
other
actions
or
belongs
to
a
class
of
actions
which
we
habitually
regard
as
right
or
wrong
and
consequently
as
soon
as
the
reference
or
association
is
made
the
moral
feeling
supervenes
now
in
this
process
there
are
two
possible
sources
of
error
in
the
first
place
the
act
of
reference
or
association
may
be
faulty
and
the
action
may
not
really
belong
to
the
class
to
which
we
refer
or
really
be
like
the
other
actions
with
which
we
associate
it
this
fault
is
one
of
classification
and
can
only
be
remedied
as
all
other
faulty
acts
of
classification
by
learning
to
discriminate
between
the
essential
and
the
marks
of
similarity
and
insisting
on
the
presence
of
the
essential
marks
in
criminal
cases
this
is
one
of
the
functions
of
the
jury
and
unless
they
exercise
great
care
they
may
easily
be
mistaken
as
to
whether
an
alleged
act
of
fraud
theft
assault
was
really
an
act
of
that
kind
but
even
if
the
action
be
referred
to
its
right
head
there
remains
the
second
question
whether
we
are
really
justified
in
regarding
the
class
of
actions
itself
as
right
or
wrong
failure
to
prosecute
for
or
punish
heresy
or
witchcraft
was
at
one
time
regarded
at
least
as
wrong
as
failure
to
punish
or
prosecute
for
theft
or
murder
would
now
be
to
decline
to
fight
a
duel
was
till
quite
recently
to
place
yourself
outside
the
pale
of
gentlemen
a
reluctance
to
sacrifice
herself
on
the
funeral
pile
of
her
dead
husband
was
till
the
practice
of
suttee
was
abolished
by
the
british
government
one
of
the
most
immoral
traits
which
a
brahman
widow
could
exhibit
now
have
we
any
means
of
discriminating
and
if
so
how
do
we
discriminate
between
those
acts
which
are
really
and
those
which
are
only
reputed
right
or
wrong
that
there
is
great
need
of
such
a
test
if
it
can
be
discovered
is
plain
the
wide
divergences
of
opinion
on
matters
of
conduct
in
different
ages
in
different
countries
in
different
classes
of
society
and
even
amongst
men
of
the
same
class
in
the
same
country
and
at
the
same
time
shew
at
once
the
vast
importance
of
ascertaining
some
common
measure
of
actions
and
that
there
is
no
uniform
rule
of
right
and
wrong
to
be
found
in
the
human
mind
itself
if
there
is
such
a
rule
it
must
be
derived
from
some
external
considerations
and
if
there
is
no
such
rule
then
morality
must
be
to
a
large
extent
a
matter
of
prejudice
fancy
and
caprice
now
i
conceive
that
there
is
a
simple
mode
of
ascertaining
whether
there
is
any
test
of
actions
other
than
the
merely
subjective
determinations
of
our
own
minds
or
in
other
words
whether
there
are
any
reasons
or
external
considerations
by
which
the
mind
guides
itself
in
its
decisions
on
matters
of
conduct
do
our
moral
opinions
merely
vary
or
do
they
grow
is
there
any
progress
to
be
traced
in
morality
or
does
it
simply
oscillate
within
certain
limits
round
a
fixed
point
if
some
and
idea
of
right
or
some
universal
sense
were
the
test
of
morality
then
we
might
expect
that
the
moral
decisions
of
all
men
would
be
uniform
or
at
least
approximately
uniform
if
on
the
other
hand
there
were
no
test
at
all
or
what
amounts
to
much
the
same
thing
a
merely
personal
test
then
we
might
expect
that
the
moral
judgments
of
mankind
would
vary
arbitrarily
according
to
the
disposition
and
temperament
of
each
individual
man
but
if
there
be
a
test
derived
from
external
considerations
and
capable
of
being
applied
to
particular
cases
by
the
ordinary
processes
of
reasoning
then
we
may
fairly
expect
that
as
the
opportunities
of
observation
and
experience
increase
the
test
will
be
applied
more
widely
and
more
accurately
and
that
the
science
of
conduct
will
grow
like
all
other
sciences
with
the
advance
of
knowledge
and
of
general
civilisation
now
what
as
a
mutter
of
fact
has
been
the
case
can
anyone
affect
to
doubt
that
the
morality
of
civilized
countries
is
far
higher
and
purer
and
far
better
adapted
to
secure
the
preservation
and
progress
of
society
than
the
customs
of
savage
or
barbaric
tribes
or
however
enamoured
a
man
may
be
of
classical
antiquity
is
there
any
one
who
would
be
prepared
to
change
the
ethical
code
and
the
prevailing
ethical
sentiment
of
modern
times
for
those
of
the
greeks
or
romans
or
again
should
we
be
willing
in
this
respect
to
go
back
three
hundred
or
two
hundred
or
even
one
hundred
years
in
our
own
history
are
not
the
abolition
of
slavery
the
improved
and
improving
treatment
of
captives
taken
in
war
of
women
and
children
of
the
distressed
and
unfortunate
and
even
of
the
lower
animals
alone
sufficient
to
mark
the
difference
between
the
morality
of
earlier
and
of
later
times
i
shall
assume
then
that
there
is
a
test
of
conduct
and
that
this
test
is
of
such
a
character
that
its
continued
application
by
individual
thinkers
or
by
mankind
at
large
consciously
or
is
sufficient
to
account
for
the
existence
of
a
progressive
morality
but
if
so
it
must
be
a
test
which
experience
enables
us
to
apply
with
increasing
accuracy
and
which
is
derived
from
external
considerations
or
in
other
words
from
the
observation
of
the
effects
and
tendencies
of
actions
and
here
i
may
observe
parenthetically
that
to
make
or
reason
or
sense
the
test
of
action
as
for
instance
bishop
butler
appears
to
do
in
the
case
of
conscience
is
even
on
the
supposition
of
the
independent
existence
of
these
to
confound
the
judge
with
the
law
which
governs
his
decisions
the
with
the
rules
in
accordance
with
which
it
operates
limiting
ourselves
therefore
to
a
test
which
is
derived
from
a
consideration
of
the
results
direct
and
indirect
immediate
and
remote
of
our
actions
we
simply
have
to
enquire
what
is
the
characteristic
in
these
results
which
men
have
in
view
when
they
try
to
act
rightly
and
which
they
mistake
ignore
or
lose
sight
of
when
they
act
wrongly
there
are
in
the
main
three
answers
to
this
question
though
they
are
rather
different
modes
i
conceive
of
presenting
the
same
idea
than
distinct
and
independent
explanations
it
may
be
said
that
we
look
to
the
manner
in
which
the
action
will
affect
the
happiness
or
pleasure
of
those
whom
it
concerns
or
their
welfare
or
or
the
development
or
perfection
of
their
character
now
it
seems
to
me
that
these
are
by
no
means
necessarily
antagonistic
modes
of
speaking
and
that
in
attempting
to
determine
the
test
of
right
action
they
are
all
useful
as
complementing
each
other
there
is
however
a
view
of
the
measure
of
actions
which
though
derived
from
external
considerations
is
opposed
to
them
all
and
which
it
may
be
desirable
to
notice
at
once
with
the
object
of
eliminating
it
from
our
enquiry
it
is
that
we
are
only
concerned
with
actions
so
far
as
they
affect
ourselves
and
that
providing
we
observe
the
law
of
the
land
which
will
punish
us
if
we
do
not
observe
it
we
are
under
no
further
obligations
to
our
this
paradox
for
such
it
is
has
mainly
acquired
notoriety
though
the
advocacy
of
hobbes
though
it
has
sometimes
been
ignorantly
attributed
to
bentham
and
other
writers
of
what
is
called
the
utilitarian
school
but
be
this
as
it
may
it
is
so
plainly
inconsistent
with
some
of
the
most
obvious
facts
of
human
nature
and
specially
with
the
existence
of
that
large
and
essential
group
of
emotions
which
we
call
the
sympathetic
feelings
as
well
as
with
the
constitution
of
family
social
and
civic
life
that
it
is
unnecessary
here
further
to
discuss
it
the
views
now
generally
accepted
as
to
the
origin
of
society
in
the
family
or
tribal
relations
are
alike
irreconcileable
with
the
selfish
psychology
from
which
hobbes
educes
his
system
of
morality
and
with
that
of
nature
in
which
every
man
was
at
war
with
every
man
from
which
he
traces
the
growth
of
law
and
government
reverting
therefore
to
those
tests
of
conduct
which
recognise
the
independent
existence
of
social
as
well
as
springs
of
action
i
shall
now
make
some
remarks
on
the
appropriateness
and
adequacy
for
the
purpose
of
designating
such
tests
of
the
three
classes
of
terms
noticed
above
to
begin
with
happiness
or
pleasure
taking
happiness
to
mean
the
balance
of
pleasures
over
pains
and
degrees
of
happiness
the
proportions
of
this
balance
it
will
be
sufficient
if
i
confine
myself
to
the
word
one
statement
then
of
the
test
of
the
morality
or
rightness
of
an
action
is
that
it
should
result
in
a
larger
amount
of
pleasure
than
pain
to
all
those
whom
it
affects
but
it
is
at
once
objected
that
there
is
the
greatest
variety
of
pleasures
and
pains
intellectual
moral
aesthetic
sympathetic
sensual
and
so
on
and
it
is
asked
how
are
we
to
determine
their
respective
values
and
to
strike
the
balance
between
the
conflicting
kinds
how
much
sensual
pleasure
would
compensate
for
the
pangs
of
an
evil
conscience
or
what
amount
of
intellectual
enjoyment
would
allay
the
cravings
of
hunger
or
thirst
the
only
escape
from
this
difficulty
is
frankly
to
acknowledge
that
there
are
some
pleasures
and
pains
which
are
incommensurable
with
one
other
and
that
therefore
where
they
are
concerned
we
must
forego
the
attempt
at
comparison
and
so
act
as
to
compass
the
immeasurably
greater
pleasure
or
avoid
the
immeasurably
greater
pain
especially
is
this
the
case
with
the
pleasures
and
pains
attendant
on
the
exercise
of
the
moral
feelings
a
man
who
is
tormented
with
the
recollection
of
having
committed
a
great
crime
will
as
the
phrase
goes
pleasure
in
nothing
while
similarly
a
man
who
is
enjoying
the
retrospect
of
having
done
his
duty
in
some
important
crisis
will
care
little
for
obloquy
or
even
for
the
infliction
of
physical
suffering
making
this
admission
then
as
well
as
recognising
the
fact
that
our
pleasures
differ
in
quality
as
well
as
in
volume
so
that
the
pleasures
of
the
higher
part
of
our
nature
the
religious
the
intellectual
the
moral
the
aesthetic
the
sympathetic
nature
affect
us
with
a
different
kind
of
enjoyment
from
the
sensual
pleasures
or
those
which
are
derived
from
them
we
may
rightly
regard
the
tendency
to
produce
a
balance
of
pleasure
over
pain
as
the
test
of
the
goodness
of
an
action
and
the
effort
and
intention
to
perform
acts
having
this
tendency
as
the
test
of
the
morality
of
the
agent
but
when
we
enunciate
the
production
of
pleasure
as
our
aim
or
the
balance
of
over
results
as
the
test
of
right
action
we
are
not
always
understood
to
have
admitted
these
explanations
and
consequently
there
is
always
a
danger
of
our
being
supposed
to
degrade
morality
by
identifying
it
with
the
gratification
in
ourselves
and
others
of
the
coarser
and
more
material
impulses
of
our
nature
though
then
if
due
distinctions
and
admissions
be
made
the
tendency
to
produce
in
the
long
run
the
greatest
amount
of
happiness
or
misery
pleasure
or
pain
may
be
taken
as
the
test
of
the
goodness
or
badness
of
an
action
the
phraseology
is
so
misleading
and
so
liable
to
frustrate
the
practical
objects
of
the
moralist
that
it
is
desirable
if
possible
to
find
terms
not
equally
lending
themselves
to
misinterpretation
and
perversion
let
us
now
then
consider
whether
we
are
supplied
with
such
terms
in
the
phrases
or
of
it
is
a
noble
idea
of
human
action
to
suppose
that
its
end
is
the
perfection
of
individual
men
or
the
development
of
their
various
capacities
to
the
utmost
extent
that
is
available
and
yet
as
the
phrases
and
are
apt
too
exclusively
to
suggest
material
and
the
gratification
of
the
more
animal
parts
of
our
nature
so
the
phrases
or
of
are
apt
altogether
to
keep
out
of
sight
these
necessary
of
a
healthy
and
progressive
condition
of
humanity
unless
there
were
some
standard
of
comfortable
living
and
a
constant
effort
not
only
to
maintain
but
to
improve
it
and
unless
some
zest
were
given
to
life
by
the
gratification
of
the
appetites
within
reasonable
limits
and
the
endeavour
to
obtain
the
means
of
indulging
them
men
constituted
as
they
are
would
be
in
danger
of
sinking
into
sloth
squalor
and
indigence
and
to
the
great
mass
of
mankind
the
opportunity
of
developing
and
perfecting
their
higher
nature
would
never
occur
we
seem
therefore
to
require
some
term
which
will
not
only
suggest
the
highest
results
of
moral
endeavour
but
also
the
conditions
which
in
the
case
of
humanity
are
essential
to
the
attainment
of
those
results
moreover
to
a
greater
extent
even
than
the
words
and
the
expressions
and
of
are
in
danger
of
being
supposed
to
imply
an
exclusive
reference
to
self
it
is
true
that
we
can
not
properly
develope
our
characters
much
less
attain
to
all
the
perfection
of
which
they
are
capable
without
quickening
the
moral
feeling
and
giving
larger
scope
to
the
sympathetic
emotions
but
in
the
mere
attempt
to
improve
their
own
nature
men
are
very
apt
to
lose
sight
of
their
relations
to
others
the
phrases
ought
however
to
be
taken
and
usually
are
intended
to
be
taken
to
include
the
effort
to
improve
the
character
of
others
as
well
as
our
own
and
if
this
extension
of
their
meaning
be
well
understood
and
it
is
also
understood
that
the
development
or
perfection
of
character
implies
certain
conditions
of
material
comfort
and
the
gratification
within
reasonable
limits
of
our
appetitive
nature
there
ought
to
be
no
objection
on
the
part
of
the
moralist
to
their
employment
for
the
purpose
of
designating
the
test
of
right
conduct
and
any
way
they
are
useful
as
supplementing
correcting
and
elevating
the
associations
attached
to
the
more
commonly
employed
terms
pleasure
and
happiness
but
are
there
no
terms
by
which
the
somewhat
exclusive
associations
connected
with
the
two
sets
of
phrases
already
examined
may
be
avoided
i
venture
to
suggest
that
such
terms
may
be
found
by
reverting
to
the
old
but
now
usually
discarded
expressions
and
these
words
it
seems
to
me
do
not
primarily
suggest
material
prosperity
like
happiness
nor
the
gratification
of
the
lower
parts
of
our
nature
like
pleasure
nor
the
exclusive
development
of
the
higher
parts
of
our
nature
like
perfection
but
cover
the
whole
ground
of
healthy
human
activity
and
the
conditions
which
are
favourable
to
it
corresponding
too
almost
exactly
with
the
greek
eudaimonia
of
aristotle
they
have
the
advantage
of
venerable
historic
associations
lastly
they
seem
to
have
less
of
a
personal
and
more
of
a
social
reference
than
any
of
the
other
terms
employed
we
speak
i
think
more
naturally
of
the
or
welfare
of
society
than
of
the
happiness
pleasure
or
perfection
of
society
i
can
not
therefore
but
think
that
the
moralist
would
be
wise
in
at
least
trying
the
experiment
of
recurring
to
these
terms
in
place
of
those
which
in
recent
systems
of
ethics
have
usually
superseded
them
if
it
be
said
that
they
are
vague
and
that
different
people
will
attach
different
meanings
to
them
according
to
their
own
prepossessions
and
their
own
theories
of
life
i
can
only
reply
that
this
objection
applies
with
at
least
equal
force
to
any
of
the
other
terms
which
we
have
passed
in
review
and
if
it
be
said
that
our
conceptions
of
and
welfare
are
not
fixed
but
that
our
ideas
of
the
nature
and
proper
proportions
of
their
constituents
are
undergoing
constant
modification
and
growth
i
may
ask
if
this
is
less
the
case
with
regard
to
happiness
or
the
sum
of
pleasures
or
the
balance
of
pleasures
over
pains
or
the
perfection
or
due
development
of
human
character
all
of
which
expressions
indeed
when
properly
qualified
and
explained
i
acknowledge
to
be
the
equivalents
of
those
for
which
i
have
stated
a
preference
and
here
occurs
a
difficulty
with
respect
to
all
these
expressions
and
ideas
if
their
meaning
or
content
is
not
fixed
and
specially
if
they
are
undergoing
a
constant
change
in
the
way
of
growth
with
the
progress
of
reason
and
society
how
can
we
employ
them
as
a
test
of
morality
which
is
itself
also
a
variable
conception
surely
this
is
to
make
one
indefinite
idea
the
gauge
of
another
indefinite
idea
the
answer
to
this
question
will
i
trust
bring
out
clearly
the
nature
of
a
moral
test
as
well
as
the
different
modes
of
its
application
the
ultimate
origin
of
moral
rules
i
conceive
so
far
at
least
as
science
can
trace
them
is
to
be
found
in
the
effort
of
men
to
adapt
themselves
to
the
circumstances
social
and
physical
in
which
they
are
placed
at
first
probably
this
process
of
adaptation
was
almost
automatic
and
unconscious
but
when
men
once
began
consciously
to
adapt
means
to
ends
they
would
soon
begin
to
reflect
on
their
acts
and
to
ask
themselves
the
reasons
why
they
had
selected
this
course
of
conduct
rather
than
another
the
justifying
reasons
of
their
past
acts
like
the
impelling
motives
of
their
future
acts
could
have
reference
to
nothing
but
the
convenience
or
gratification
of
themselves
or
those
amongst
whom
they
lived
and
the
acts
which
they
justified
in
themselves
they
would
approve
of
in
others
here
then
already
we
have
a
test
consciously
applied
to
the
estimation
of
conduct
experience
shews
that
this
or
that
action
promotes
some
object
which
is
included
in
the
narrow
conception
of
entertained
by
the
primitive
man
he
therefore
continues
to
act
in
accordance
with
the
rule
which
prescribes
it
or
the
habit
from
which
it
proceeds
and
in
like
manner
if
he
finds
from
experience
that
the
action
does
not
promote
that
object
and
he
is
free
to
exercise
his
own
choice
he
desists
from
it
and
perhaps
tries
the
experiment
of
substituting
another
now
in
these
cases
it
is
plain
that
any
judgment
which
the
man
exercises
independently
and
apart
from
the
society
of
which
he
is
a
member
is
guided
solely
by
the
consideration
whether
the
course
of
conduct
is
efficacious
in
attaining
its
end
that
end
being
part
of
his
conception
of
the
of
himself
his
family
or
his
tribe
if
he
thinks
about
the
matter
for
himself
at
all
this
is
the
only
consideration
of
which
he
can
take
account
there
are
three
courses
open
to
him
he
need
not
reflect
on
the
action
at
all
but
simply
follow
in
the
wake
of
his
neighbours
and
this
of
course
is
far
the
commonest
case
or
if
there
is
any
divergence
of
opinion
about
it
amongst
his
neighbours
he
may
deliberate
as
to
whose
opinion
it
is
safest
to
follow
or
lastly
he
may
consider
for
himself
whether
the
action
is
really
the
best
means
of
attaining
the
end
aimed
at
that
is
to
say
he
may
test
the
means
by
its
conduciveness
to
the
end
which
is
always
in
some
shape
the
welfare
of
himself
or
others
if
he
follows
the
opinion
of
others
it
is
plain
that
their
opinion
so
far
as
it
has
been
formed
independently
has
been
formed
in
the
manner
above
described
the
only
alternative
therefore
is
between
the
acceptance
of
existing
opinions
without
any
consideration
or
examination
and
their
reference
to
the
conception
of
or
however
else
the
idea
may
be
expressed
as
a
measure
of
their
appropriateness
and
sufficiency
the
idea
of
itself
may
be
inadequate
and
even
in
parts
incorrect
and
as
society
advances
it
is
undoubtedly
undergoing
a
constant
process
of
expansion
and
rectification
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
regard
for
their
own
welfare
or
that
of
others
however
we
may
phrase
it
is
the
only
of
conduct
in
the
light
of
which
men
can
reconsider
and
review
their
rules
unless
they
follow
the
mere
blind
impulses
of
feeling
in
which
case
they
do
not
follow
rules
at
all
but
simply
act
irrationally
or
else
observe
implicitly
the
maxims
of
conduct
which
they
find
prevalent
around
them
they
must
and
can
only
ask
the
question
whether
it
is
possible
to
alter
their
conduct
for
the
better
that
is
to
say
whether
they
can
better
promote
their
own
welfare
or
that
of
others
by
some
modification
of
their
actions
take
the
case
of
slavery
there
was
a
time
when
savage
or
barbaric
tribes
moved
by
a
regard
to
their
own
interests
and
also
we
may
trust
touched
by
some
compassion
for
their
victims
began
to
substitute
for
the
wholesale
butchery
of
their
enemies
defeated
in
war
the
practice
of
retaining
some
or
all
of
them
for
the
purposes
of
domestic
or
agrarian
service
again
there
came
a
time
when
viewed
by
the
side
of
other
forms
of
service
which
had
meanwhile
come
into
existence
slavery
with
its
various
incidents
began
to
shock
the
philanthropic
sentiments
of
the
more
civilized
races
of
mankind
while
the
question
also
began
to
be
raised
whether
was
not
economically
at
a
disadvantage
when
compared
with
free
labour
and
the
result
of
these
combined
considerations
often
aided
by
a
strong
and
enthusiastic
outburst
of
popular
feeling
has
been
the
total
disappearance
of
slavery
amongst
civilized
and
its
almost
total
disappearance
even
amongst
barbaric
or
races
take
too
the
revolting
practice
common
among
many
savage
tribes
past
and
present
of
killing
and
eating
aged
parents
or
other
infirm
members
of
the
tribe
when
engaged
in
war
this
practice
which
at
first
sight
seems
so
utterly
unnatural
was
doubtless
dictated
in
part
at
least
by
the
desire
to
save
their
victims
from
the
worse
fate
of
being
tortured
and
mutilated
by
their
enemies
subsequently
in
the
history
of
some
of
these
tribes
there
has
come
a
time
when
it
has
been
discovered
that
a
more
humane
mode
of
attaining
the
same
object
is
to
build
strong
places
and
leave
the
feebler
folk
at
home
if
we
follow
the
varying
marriage
customs
of
savage
or
barbaric
tribes
we
shall
find
in
the
same
way
that
they
have
always
been
originally
framed
on
reasons
of
convenience
and
that
when
they
have
been
changed
it
has
been
because
different
views
of
including
the
needs
of
purity
closer
attachment
increased
care
of
children
and
the
like
have
begun
to
prevail
in
all
these
examples
which
might
be
multiplied
to
any
extent
it
is
plain
that
changes
of
conduct
are
moulded
and
determined
by
changes
of
opinion
as
to
what
is
best
and
most
suitable
for
the
circumstances
of
the
individual
the
family
the
tribe
or
whatever
the
social
aggregate
may
be
and
i
may
venture
to
affirm
that
wherever
any
change
of
moral
conduct
takes
place
unless
it
be
dictated
by
blind
passion
or
mere
submission
to
authority
enforced
or
voluntary
the
change
is
invariably
due
to
some
change
of
opinion
on
what
constitutes
the
advantage
of
the
persons
whom
it
affects
it
is
true
therefore
that
moral
conduct
varies
and
it
is
true
that
our
conceptions
of
vary
but
the
two
do
not
vary
independently
of
one
another
or
either
of
them
capriciously
increased
experience
of
ourselves
and
of
others
enlarged
observation
of
the
external
world
more
matured
reflexion
are
constantly
expanding
and
rectifying
our
conceptions
of
what
constitutes
human
welfare
and
to
this
constantly
amended
conception
are
readjusted
from
time
to
time
our
conduct
and
our
sentiments
on
the
conduct
both
of
ourselves
and
of
others
in
brief
then
the
conduct
of
men
and
the
sentiments
of
men
on
conduct
vary
with
their
conceptions
of
and
their
conceptions
of
are
determined
by
experience
including
the
opportunity
for
experience
and
reflexion
my
conclusion
may
perhaps
be
illustrated
and
enforced
by
one
further
consideration
it
generally
happens
in
the
progress
of
society
that
after
a
number
of
rules
of
conduct
have
been
accumulated
they
become
enshrined
in
some
sacred
book
some
code
or
at
least
some
constant
and
authoritative
tradition
in
this
manner
they
may
be
stereotyped
for
ages
now
after
a
time
these
rules
especially
if
they
are
numerous
and
minute
become
unsuited
at
least
in
part
to
the
altered
circumstances
of
the
society
and
probably
bear
hardly
on
many
of
the
individuals
composing
it
when
this
condition
of
things
is
beginning
to
be
intolerable
there
often
arises
the
social
reformer
and
what
is
the
course
which
he
pursues
he
endeavours
to
shew
how
unsuitable
the
rules
have
become
to
attain
the
ends
which
they
were
originally
intended
to
compass
in
how
much
better
a
manner
other
rules
would
attain
these
objects
how
grievously
the
present
rules
bear
on
many
classes
and
individuals
in
the
state
how
unequal
they
are
in
their
incidence
at
what
a
disadvantage
they
place
the
community
in
comparison
with
neighbouring
communities
how
easily
they
may
be
altered
and
the
like
in
fact
the
considerations
which
he
urges
may
all
be
included
in
the
one
argument
that
the
existing
rules
are
opposed
to
the
of
the
state
and
that
the
advantages
resulting
from
their
abrogation
will
more
than
compensate
for
any
disturbance
of
existing
relations
which
may
ensue
from
the
change
apart
from
force
or
mere
rant
rhetoric
or
imposture
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
other
resource
the
reformer
has
open
to
him
and
in
those
cases
where
there
is
no
accumulation
of
antiquated
rules
and
no
need
of
the
individual
reformer
but
where
society
at
large
has
the
happy
knack
of
imperceptibly
accommodating
its
practice
and
principles
of
action
to
altered
circumstances
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
is
by
considerations
of
half
conscious
though
the
process
of
application
may
be
that
the
change
is
directed
the
plastic
power
by
which
men
accommodate
their
actions
and
even
their
maxims
of
conduct
to
modifications
in
surrounding
circumstances
is
one
of
the
advantages
which
they
gain
by
the
progress
of
civilisation
in
ancient
society
the
tyranny
of
custom
is
often
almost
absolute
in
modern
society
changes
which
would
otherwise
require
the
drastic
hand
of
the
reformer
are
often
quietly
effected
by
the
gradual
and
almost
imperceptible
action
of
the
people
themselves
it
is
thus
that
the
equity
branch
of
english
law
and
much
of
our
case
law
grew
up
giving
expression
to
changes
which
had
already
occurred
in
the
current
of
popular
opinion
it
is
thus
that
the
obligation
of
to
offer
on
the
slightest
provocation
and
to
accept
without
questioning
a
to
take
each
other
lives
has
in
most
civilized
countries
now
grown
obsolete
having
gradually
become
enfeebled
together
with
the
exaggerated
military
spirit
which
gave
it
birth
it
is
thus
also
that
with
an
increase
of
the
industrial
spirit
with
softened
manners
and
with
that
quickening
of
our
sympathetic
nature
which
has
gradually
been
effected
by
the
teaching
of
christianity
a
strong
sentiment
against
slavery
a
respect
for
human
life
as
such
a
regard
for
the
weak
the
suffering
the
oppressed
and
many
tender
feelings
of
a
similar
kind
have
almost
insensibly
been
developed
as
an
essential
element
in
modern
civilisation
these
considerations
naturally
lead
me
to
notice
the
two
different
ways
in
which
the
test
of
conduct
may
be
and
as
a
fact
is
applied
one
mode
is
the
conscious
and
intentional
application
of
it
by
the
reflective
man
the
other
is
the
and
almost
instinctive
application
of
it
by
the
community
at
large
in
morals
as
in
the
arts
men
almost
without
knowing
it
are
constantly
their
means
to
their
ends
feeling
their
way
to
some
tentative
solution
of
a
new
difficulty
or
a
better
solution
of
an
old
one
shaping
their
conduct
with
reference
to
the
special
needs
of
the
situation
in
which
they
are
placed
it
is
thus
for
the
most
part
that
new
circumstances
develope
new
rules
and
that
the
simple
maxims
of
a
primitive
people
are
gradually
replaced
by
the
multifarious
code
of
law
and
morals
with
which
we
are
now
familiar
the
guiding
principle
throughout
the
process
is
the
conception
of
their
own
good
comprehending
as
it
does
not
only
ease
personal
comfort
and
gratification
of
the
various
appetites
and
desires
which
in
the
early
stages
of
society
are
the
preponderating
considerations
but
also
those
higher
constituents
of
welfare
both
individual
and
social
which
attain
an
importance
as
society
advances
such
as
are
the
development
of
the
moral
the
intellectual
and
the
aesthetic
faculties
the
purification
of
the
religious
sentiments
the
expansion
of
the
sympathetic
feelings
the
diffusion
of
liberty
and
prosperity
the
consolidation
of
national
unity
the
elevation
of
human
life
this
principle
works
throughout
the
community
actuating
some
men
in
its
higher
others
in
its
lower
forms
but
except
where
the
force
of
tradition
or
prejudice
is
too
strong
for
it
invariably
moulding
conduct
into
accordance
with
the
more
complex
requirements
of
advancing
civilisation
its
action
of
course
is
not
wholly
advantageous
growing
needs
and
more
complicated
relations
suggest
to
men
fresh
devices
for
compassing
their
selfish
ends
such
as
the
various
forms
of
fraud
forgery
and
conspiracy
as
well
as
more
enlarged
or
more
effective
schemes
of
beneficence
stricter
or
more
intelligent
applications
of
the
principle
of
justice
and
possibilities
of
higher
and
freer
developments
of
their
faculties
but
on
the
whole
and
setting
aside
as
exceptional
certain
periods
of
retrogression
such
as
the
decline
of
the
roman
empire
the
evolution
of
society
seems
to
be
attended
by
the
progress
of
morality
and
specially
by
the
amelioration
of
social
relations
whether
between
individuals
families
or
states
the
intelligence
that
apprehends
the
greater
good
upon
the
desire
to
attain
it
and
the
result
is
the
combination
of
more
rational
aims
with
a
purer
interest
in
the
pursuit
of
them
this
tendency
in
society
at
large
to
modify
and
its
conduct
in
conformity
with
fuller
and
more
improved
conceptions
of
which
are
themselves
suggested
by
a
growing
experience
is
reinforced
especially
in
the
later
stages
of
civilisation
by
the
consciously
reflective
action
of
philosophers
and
reformers
it
is
the
function
of
these
classes
not
only
to
give
expression
to
the
thoughts
which
are
working
obscurely
in
the
minds
of
other
men
but
also
to
detect
those
aspects
and
bearings
of
conduct
which
are
not
obvious
to
the
general
intelligence
this
task
is
effected
partly
by
tracing
actions
to
their
indirect
and
remote
results
partly
by
more
distinctly
realising
their
results
whether
immediate
or
remote
direct
or
indirect
and
partly
by
generalising
them
that
is
to
say
by
considering
what
would
happen
to
society
if
men
generally
were
to
act
in
that
manner
thus
take
the
case
of
lying
in
primitive
states
of
society
and
even
in
some
more
advanced
nations
no
great
opprobrium
attaches
to
telling
a
lie
in
ancient
greece
for
instance
veracity
by
no
means
occupied
the
same
prominent
position
among
the
virtues
that
it
does
among
ourselves
and
even
now
teutonic
races
are
generally
credited
with
a
peculiar
sensitiveness
on
the
subject
of
truthfulness
this
improved
sentiment
as
regards
veracity
is
no
doubt
partly
due
to
the
realisation
of
its
importance
and
of
the
inconveniences
which
result
from
the
breaches
of
it
especially
in
commercial
affairs
by
the
members
of
a
community
at
large
but
it
must
also
to
a
great
extent
have
been
produced
by
the
definite
teaching
conveyed
in
books
and
by
moral
and
religious
instructors
follow
out
a
lie
to
all
its
consequences
realise
the
feelings
of
the
person
deceived
by
it
when
he
has
discovered
the
deception
above
all
consider
what
would
be
the
result
if
men
were
commonly
to
deceive
one
another
and
no
man
could
place
any
dependence
on
the
information
which
his
neighbour
gave
him
and
then
a
falsehood
excites
very
different
feelings
from
what
it
does
when
regarded
simply
as
an
isolated
act
or
again
take
the
evasion
of
taxes
there
is
probably
even
yet
no
country
in
which
the
popular
sentiment
on
this
subject
is
sufficiently
enlightened
and
severe
a
man
smuggles
a
box
of
cigars
or
evades
paying
a
tax
for
his
dog
or
makes
an
insufficient
return
of
his
income
and
few
of
his
neighbours
if
the
fact
come
to
their
knowledge
think
the
worse
of
him
the
character
and
consequences
of
the
action
are
not
obvious
and
hence
they
do
not
perceive
what
on
reflexion
or
if
guided
by
proper
instruction
they
could
hardly
fail
to
realise
that
the
act
is
really
a
theft
only
practised
on
the
community
at
large
instead
of
on
an
individual
member
of
it
and
that
if
every
one
were
to
act
in
the
same
way
the
collection
of
taxes
and
consequently
the
administration
and
defence
of
the
country
the
maintenance
of
its
army
and
navy
its
police
its
harbours
and
roads
would
become
an
impossibility
and
it
would
quickly
relapse
into
barbarism
other
familiar
instances
of
the
advantage
to
be
derived
from
the
conscious
and
intentional
application
of
the
reasoning
powers
to
matters
of
conduct
may
be
found
in
the
successive
reforms
of
the
penal
code
of
any
civilized
country
or
in
the
abolition
of
slavery
punishment
is
in
all
very
early
stages
of
society
capricious
mostly
unregulated
by
any
definite
customs
or
enactments
and
consequently
often
disproportioned
either
in
the
way
of
excess
or
defect
to
the
character
of
the
offence
as
the
community
advances
in
complexity
and
intelligence
successive
reformers
arise
who
attempt
by
definite
enactment
to
regulate
the
amount
of
punishment
due
to
each
description
of
offence
and
from
time
to
time
to
increase
or
diminish
as
occasion
seems
to
require
the
severity
of
the
existing
code
the
considerations
by
which
at
least
in
our
own
time
these
reforms
are
determined
are
such
as
these
the
adequacy
or
inadequacy
of
the
punishment
to
deter
men
from
the
commission
of
the
offence
the
tendency
of
excessive
punishment
to
produce
a
reaction
of
sentiment
in
favour
of
the
criminal
and
a
reluctance
on
the
part
of
the
judge
or
jury
to
convict
the
superfluous
suffering
inflicted
by
that
part
of
the
punishment
which
is
in
excess
of
the
requirements
of
the
case
due
publicity
and
notoriety
as
a
means
of
warning
others
the
reform
of
the
criminal
himself
and
so
on
all
these
considerations
it
will
be
observed
are
derived
from
tracing
the
effects
of
the
punishment
either
on
the
criminal
himself
or
on
persons
who
are
under
a
similar
temptation
to
commit
the
crime
or
on
the
sentiment
of
society
at
large
or
of
that
portion
of
society
which
is
connected
with
the
administration
of
justice
and
it
is
only
by
the
exercise
of
great
circumspection
and
of
a
keen
intelligence
on
the
part
of
the
statesman
the
jurist
or
the
moralist
that
grave
errors
can
be
avoided
and
an
adequate
estimate
of
the
probable
results
can
be
formed
the
mere
instinct
of
the
community
unmodified
and
uncorrected
by
the
conscious
speculations
of
its
more
thoughtful
members
would
be
in
much
danger
of
either
causing
a
large
amount
of
needless
suffering
to
the
criminal
or
of
seriously
diminishing
the
security
of
society
it
would
almost
certainly
be
guilty
of
grave
inequalities
in
the
apportionment
of
punishment
to
specific
crimes
the
history
of
slavery
similarly
shews
the
importance
of
the
functions
of
the
moralist
and
the
reformer
it
must
have
been
at
the
suggestion
of
some
prominent
member
of
a
tribe
whose
intelligence
was
in
advance
of
that
of
his
fellows
that
men
first
took
to
capturing
their
defeated
enemies
with
a
view
to
future
service
instead
of
slaughtering
them
on
the
field
of
battle
and
we
know
that
in
the
time
of
plato
and
aristotle
there
had
already
arisen
a
strong
sentiment
against
the
enslaving
of
greeks
by
greeks
originating
probably
in
the
instinctive
sympathy
of
race
but
quickened
and
fostered
doubtless
by
the
superior
capacity
which
men
possess
of
realising
suffering
and
misfortune
in
those
who
are
constituted
and
endowed
like
themselves
by
the
new
conception
of
a
unity
and
by
the
vivid
sense
which
on
reflexion
the
citizens
of
each
state
must
have
entertained
of
their
own
liability
to
be
reduced
in
turn
to
the
same
condition
in
modern
times
the
movement
which
has
led
to
the
entire
abolition
of
slavery
in
civilized
countries
owes
much
undoubtedly
to
the
softened
manners
and
wider
sympathies
of
a
society
largely
transformed
by
the
combined
operation
of
christianity
and
culture
but
it
has
been
promoted
to
no
inconsiderable
degree
by
conscious
reflexion
and
direct
argument
social
and
religious
reasons
derived
from
the
community
of
nature
and
origin
in
man
reinforced
by
a
vivid
realisation
of
the
sufferings
of
others
and
appealing
forcibly
to
the
tender
and
sympathetic
feelings
have
with
the
economical
considerations
drawn
from
the
wastefulness
and
comparative
inefficiency
of
slave
labour
and
with
what
may
be
called
the
reason
of
the
hardening
and
debasing
effect
of
on
the
character
of
the
himself
it
will
be
sufficient
in
this
connexion
simply
to
allude
to
the
ideals
of
mercy
purity
humility
and
which
are
pourtrayed
in
the
christian
teaching
and
have
ever
since
the
early
days
of
christianity
exercised
so
vast
and
powerful
an
influence
on
large
sections
of
mankind
there
is
of
course
a
process
of
constant
interaction
going
on
between
the
two
elements
in
the
constitution
of
moral
sentiment
which
i
have
been
attempting
to
describe
the
circumstances
opinions
and
feelings
of
the
society
of
which
he
is
a
member
must
necessarily
contribute
to
determine
the
opinions
and
feelings
the
character
and
aims
of
the
moralist
or
the
reformer
in
turn
the
moralist
or
reformer
modifies
corrects
and
elevates
the
current
moral
sentiment
of
those
who
are
brought
within
the
influence
of
his
work
and
this
result
is
usually
a
permanent
one
when
the
average
moral
sentiment
on
a
particular
point
of
conduct
has
been
consciously
raised
and
the
change
is
fully
realised
it
seldom
happens
that
it
afterwards
recedes
though
the
automatic
or
adaptations
of
society
to
new
needs
and
circumstances
when
regarded
from
a
more
general
point
of
view
are
not
infrequently
found
to
be
regressive
as
well
as
progressive
thus
though
we
may
imagine
the
distinctions
between
the
different
classes
of
society
becoming
more
numerous
or
more
accentuated
as
i
believe
to
have
actually
occurred
in
england
during
the
present
century
or
the
evasion
of
taxation
becoming
more
general
than
it
at
present
is
we
can
hardly
conceive
a
recurrence
to
slavery
or
a
needless
increase
in
the
severity
of
punishments
or
a
revival
of
the
habits
of
the
last
century
when
society
is
fully
aware
of
its
moral
gains
it
is
not
likely
knowingly
to
surrender
them
hence
allowing
for
occasional
oscillations
and
for
possible
exceptions
in
certain
departments
of
conduct
morality
as
a
whole
almost
necessarily
advances
with
the
general
progress
of
intelligence
it
is
not
altogether
easy
to
adjust
the
respective
claims
of
society
at
large
and
of
the
individual
thinker
in
the
constitution
of
moral
theory
or
in
other
words
to
determine
the
limits
within
which
the
speculative
moralist
may
legitimately
endeavour
to
reform
the
existing
moral
sentiment
it
is
plain
that
it
must
be
open
to
the
moralist
and
in
fact
to
every
intelligent
citizen
to
criticize
the
current
morality
or
else
moral
progress
even
if
it
took
place
at
all
would
on
many
points
of
conduct
be
exceedingly
slow
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
equally
plain
that
a
constant
discussion
of
the
accepted
rules
of
conduct
would
weaken
the
moral
sentiment
lessen
the
sense
of
obligation
and
suggest
a
general
uncertainty
as
to
the
validity
of
the
maxims
which
in
their
relations
to
one
another
men
usually
take
for
granted
hence
though
it
would
be
almost
fatal
to
moral
progress
to
discourage
speculation
on
moral
topics
the
moralist
must
always
bear
in
mind
that
his
task
is
one
which
is
not
lightly
to
be
undertaken
and
that
with
an
exception
to
be
noticed
presently
the
presumption
should
always
be
in
favour
of
existing
rules
of
conduct
if
for
no
other
reason
this
presumption
ought
to
be
made
on
the
practical
ground
that
a
disturbance
of
the
moral
sentiment
on
one
point
is
likely
to
weaken
its
force
generally
and
before
we
expose
men
to
this
danger
we
ought
to
have
some
adequate
justification
but
there
is
also
the
speculative
ground
that
any
given
society
and
indeed
mankind
generally
has
been
engaged
for
ages
in
feeling
its
way
instinctively
or
towards
a
solution
of
the
problems
which
the
philosopher
is
attempting
to
solve
consciously
and
of
set
purpose
that
on
the
whole
a
society
has
solved
these
problems
in
the
manner
best
suited
to
its
existing
needs
and
circumstances
may
fairly
be
taken
for
granted
and
even
where
the
ethical
of
the
reformer
is
very
superior
to
the
of
the
society
which
he
wishes
to
reform
he
will
be
wise
in
endeavouring
to
introduce
his
reforms
gradually
and
if
possible
in
connexion
with
principles
already
acknowledged
rather
than
in
attempting
to
effect
a
moral
revolution
the
ultimate
results
of
which
it
may
be
impossible
to
foresee
the
work
of
the
moralist
is
therefore
best
regarded
as
corrective
of
and
supplementary
to
the
work
which
mankind
is
constantly
doing
for
itself
and
not
as
antagonistic
to
it
the
method
is
the
same
in
both
cases
only
it
is
applied
and
merely
as
occasions
suggest
it
in
the
one
case
consciously
and
spontaneously
in
the
other
in
both
cases
alike
the
guiding
principle
whether
of
action
or
of
speculation
upon
action
is
the
adaptation
of
conduct
to
surrounding
circumstances
physical
and
social
with
a
view
to
promote
to
the
utmost
extent
possible
the
of
the
individual
and
of
the
society
of
which
he
is
a
member
where
the
interests
of
the
individual
and
of
the
society
clash
society
that
is
to
say
a
man
usually
approves
as
we
saw
in
the
last
chapter
of
the
sacrifice
of
individual
to
social
interests
a
course
of
conduct
which
is
also
on
reflexion
usually
stamped
by
the
individual
own
approbation
and
hence
we
may
say
briefly
that
their
tendency
to
promote
or
impair
the
welfare
of
society
is
the
test
by
which
in
different
ways
all
actions
are
estimated
alike
by
the
philosopher
in
his
hours
of
speculation
and
by
the
community
at
large
in
the
practical
work
of
life
in
laying
down
the
principle
that
the
presumption
of
the
moralist
should
always
be
in
favour
of
existing
rules
of
conduct
i
intimated
that
there
was
one
exception
to
this
principle
the
exception
includes
all
those
cases
which
are
legitimate
though
not
obvious
applications
of
existing
rules
and
to
which
therefore
the
ordinary
moral
sentiment
does
not
attach
in
the
same
way
that
it
does
to
the
plainer
and
more
direct
applications
thus
if
it
can
be
shewn
as
it
undoubtedly
can
be
that
smuggling
falls
under
the
head
of
stealing
and
holding
out
false
hopes
under
that
of
lying
the
moralist
need
take
no
account
of
the
lax
moral
sentiment
which
exists
with
regard
to
these
practices
though
of
course
in
estimating
the
guilt
of
the
individual
as
distinct
from
the
character
of
the
act
due
allowance
must
be
made
for
his
imperfect
appreciation
of
the
moral
bearings
of
his
conduct
this
exception
as
will
be
found
in
the
next
chapter
covers
and
therefore
at
once
justifies
a
large
proportion
of
the
criticisms
which
in
the
present
advanced
stage
of
morality
when
the
more
fundamental
principles
have
been
already
settled
it
is
still
open
to
us
to
make
it
remains
now
to
enquire
what
is
the
justification
of
the
test
propounded
in
this
chapter
i
do
not
found
it
on
any
external
considerations
whether
of
law
or
revelation
both
of
which
i
conceive
presuppose
morality
but
on
the
very
make
and
constitution
of
our
nature
the
justification
of
the
moral
test
and
the
source
of
the
moral
feeling
are
alike
i
conceive
to
be
discovered
by
an
examination
of
human
nature
and
so
far
as
that
nature
has
a
divine
origin
so
far
is
the
origin
of
morality
divine
whatever
the
ultimate
source
of
morality
may
be
to
us
at
all
events
it
can
only
be
known
as
revealed
or
reflected
in
ourselves
what
then
is
it
in
the
constitution
of
our
nature
which
leads
us
to
aim
at
the
of
ourselves
and
those
around
us
and
to
measure
our
own
conduct
and
that
of
others
by
the
extent
to
which
it
promotes
these
ends
in
answering
this
question
i
must
give
a
brief
account
of
the
ultimate
principles
of
human
nature
though
this
account
has
been
partly
anticipated
in
the
last
chapter
human
nature
in
its
last
analysis
seems
so
far
as
it
is
concerned
with
action
to
consist
of
certain
impulses
or
feelings
and
a
power
of
comparing
with
one
another
the
results
which
follow
from
the
gratification
of
these
feelings
which
power
reacts
upon
the
several
feelings
themselves
by
way
of
intensifying
checking
or
controlling
them
this
power
we
call
reason
the
feelings
themselves
fall
into
two
principal
groups
the
egoistic
or
feelings
which
centre
in
a
man
self
and
are
developed
by
his
personal
needs
and
the
altruistic
or
sympathetic
feelings
which
centre
in
others
and
are
developed
by
the
social
surroundings
in
which
he
finds
himself
placed
these
two
groups
of
feelings
i
conceive
were
independent
of
one
another
from
the
first
or
at
least
as
soon
as
man
could
be
called
man
and
neither
of
them
admits
of
being
resolved
into
the
other
as
the
one
was
developed
by
and
adapted
to
personal
needs
so
the
other
was
developed
by
and
adapted
to
the
manifold
requirements
of
family
or
tribal
life
which
from
the
first
was
inseparable
from
the
life
of
the
individual
intermediate
between
these
two
groups
of
feelings
the
purely
and
the
purely
sympathetic
and
derived
probably
from
the
interaction
of
both
is
another
group
which
may
be
called
the
group
this
group
includes
shame
love
of
reputation
love
of
notoriety
desire
of
fame
and
the
like
but
on
analysis
it
will
be
found
that
all
these
feelings
admit
of
being
referred
to
two
heads
the
love
of
approbation
and
the
fear
of
disapprobation
lastly
if
any
of
our
desires
or
feelings
are
thwarted
by
the
intentional
action
of
other
men
the
result
in
our
minds
is
a
feeling
which
we
call
resentment
and
which
though
it
regards
others
is
unlike
the
sympathetic
feelings
a
malevolent
and
not
a
benevolent
feeling
it
is
important
in
considering
the
economy
of
human
nature
to
notice
that
resentment
as
is
also
the
case
with
the
love
of
cruelty
is
a
secondary
not
a
primary
a
derived
not
an
original
affection
of
our
minds
for
apart
from
the
desire
to
gratify
some
or
sympathetic
feeling
or
disappointment
when
that
desire
is
not
gratified
there
is
i
conceive
no
such
thing
as
in
one
human
being
towards
another
resentment
is
properly
a
reflex
form
of
sympathy
or
arising
when
our
sympathetic
feelings
are
wounded
by
an
injury
done
to
another
or
our
desires
are
frustrated
by
an
injury
done
to
ourselves
when
in
fact
any
emotional
element
in
our
nature
is
by
the
intentional
intervention
of
another
disappointed
of
attaining
its
end
each
of
these
groups
of
feelings
admits
of
being
studied
apart
though
in
the
actual
conduct
of
life
they
are
seldom
found
to
operate
alone
and
each
under
the
continued
action
of
reason
assumes
a
form
or
forms
in
which
its
various
elements
are
brought
into
harmonious
working
with
each
other
so
as
best
to
promote
the
ends
which
the
whole
group
subserves
these
forms
thus
rationalised
or
moralised
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
use
of
such
expressions
are
in
the
case
of
the
feelings
and
rational
in
the
case
of
the
sympathetic
feelings
rational
benevolence
in
the
case
of
the
feelings
a
reasonable
regard
for
the
opinion
of
others
and
in
the
case
of
the
resentful
feelings
a
sense
of
justice
these
higher
forms
of
the
several
groups
of
feelings
themselves
require
to
be
harmonised
before
man
can
satisfy
the
needs
of
his
nature
as
a
whole
and
when
under
the
control
of
reason
they
become
a
rational
desire
for
the
combined
welfare
of
the
individual
and
of
society
or
if
we
choose
to
use
different
but
equivalent
expressions
of
the
individual
considered
as
an
unit
of
society
or
of
society
considered
as
including
the
individual
in
a
settled
state
of
existence
the
interests
of
the
individual
and
of
society
even
leaving
out
of
account
the
pleasures
and
pains
of
the
moral
sanction
are
for
the
most
part
identical
if
an
individual
pursues
a
selfish
course
of
conduct
neglecting
the
interests
and
feelings
of
others
he
is
almost
certain
to
suffer
for
it
in
the
long
run
and
the
prosperity
and
general
of
the
community
in
which
they
live
is
to
citizens
living
a
normal
life
and
pursuing
ordinary
avocations
an
essential
condition
of
their
own
prosperity
and
on
the
other
hand
it
is
by
each
man
attending
to
his
own
business
and
directing
his
efforts
to
the
promotion
of
his
own
interests
or
those
of
his
family
his
firm
or
whatever
may
be
the
smaller
social
aggregate
in
which
his
work
chiefly
lies
that
the
interests
of
the
community
at
large
are
best
secured
men
whose
time
is
mainly
taken
up
with
philanthropic
enterprises
are
very
likely
to
neglect
the
duties
which
lie
immediately
before
them
learn
and
labour
truly
to
get
mine
own
living
and
to
do
my
duty
in
that
state
of
life
unto
which
it
shall
please
god
to
call
me
is
a
very
homely
but
it
is
an
essential
lesson
that
the
great
mass
of
the
citizens
of
a
country
should
lay
it
well
to
heart
and
act
habitually
on
it
is
the
first
condition
of
national
prosperity
of
course
this
primary
regard
to
our
own
interests
or
those
of
the
persons
with
whom
we
are
more
immediately
connected
must
be
limited
by
wider
considerations
a
man
has
duties
not
only
to
himself
and
his
own
family
but
to
his
neighbours
to
the
various
institutions
with
which
he
is
connected
to
his
town
his
country
mankind
at
large
and
even
the
whole
sentient
creation
how
far
these
should
limit
each
other
or
a
man
individual
or
family
interests
is
a
question
by
no
means
easy
to
answer
and
is
the
main
problem
which
each
man
has
to
be
perpetually
solving
for
himself
and
society
at
large
for
us
all
there
is
hardly
any
waking
hour
in
which
we
have
not
to
attempt
to
settle
rival
claims
of
this
kind
and
according
as
we
settle
them
to
our
own
satisfaction
or
not
so
have
we
peace
or
trouble
of
mind
no
one
can
reasonably
deny
that
the
more
immediate
interests
of
the
individual
and
of
the
various
social
aggregates
including
society
at
large
are
frequently
in
conflict
it
seems
to
me
i
must
confess
that
it
is
also
futile
to
deny
that
there
are
occasions
though
such
occasions
may
be
rare
in
which
even
a
interests
in
the
long
run
are
incompatible
with
his
social
duties
to
take
one
or
two
instances
it
may
sometimes
be
for
the
good
of
society
that
a
man
should
speak
out
his
mind
freely
on
some
question
of
private
conduct
or
public
policy
though
his
utterances
may
be
on
the
unpopular
side
or
offend
persons
of
consideration
and
influence
the
man
performs
what
he
conceives
to
be
his
duty
but
he
knows
that
in
doing
so
he
is
sacrificing
his
prospects
or
again
he
is
invited
to
join
in
some
popular
movement
which
he
believes
to
be
of
a
questionable
or
pernicious
tendency
and
because
he
believes
that
to
take
part
in
it
would
be
untrue
to
his
own
convictions
and
possibly
harmful
to
others
he
refrains
from
doing
so
at
the
risk
of
losing
preferment
or
custom
or
patronage
then
we
are
all
familiar
with
the
difficulties
in
which
men
are
often
placed
when
they
have
to
record
a
vote
their
convictions
and
the
claims
of
the
public
service
being
on
one
side
and
their
own
interests
and
prospects
on
the
other
in
all
these
cases
it
is
true
that
if
their
moral
nature
be
in
a
healthy
condition
they
approve
on
reflexion
of
having
taken
the
more
generous
course
while
it
is
often
a
matter
of
regret
if
they
have
sacrificed
their
nobler
impulses
to
their
selfish
interests
and
taking
into
account
these
of
and
it
is
often
the
case
and
is
always
the
case
where
these
feelings
are
very
strong
that
a
man
gains
more
happiness
in
the
long
run
by
following
the
path
of
duty
and
obeying
his
social
impulses
than
by
confining
himself
to
the
narrow
view
which
would
be
dictated
by
a
cool
calculation
of
what
is
most
likely
to
conduce
to
his
own
private
good
but
where
the
moral
feelings
are
not
strong
and
still
more
where
they
are
almost
in
abeyance
i
fear
that
the
theory
that
virtue
and
happiness
are
invariably
coincident
will
hardly
be
supported
by
a
candid
examination
of
facts
to
some
men
i
fear
it
must
be
acknowledged
present
wealth
and
power
and
dignity
are
more
than
a
sufficient
recompense
for
any
remorse
which
they
may
continue
to
feel
for
past
greed
or
lack
of
candour
or
truthfulness
these
considerations
will
serve
to
shew
the
immense
importance
of
moral
education
alike
in
the
family
the
school
and
the
state
if
we
are
to
depend
on
men
acting
rightly
and
with
a
due
regard
to
wider
interests
than
their
own
we
must
take
pains
to
develope
in
them
moral
feelings
sufficiently
strong
and
sensitive
to
make
the
reflexion
on
wrong
or
selfish
acts
more
painful
to
them
than
the
sacrifice
which
is
needed
for
dutiful
and
generous
conduct
so
far
as
society
through
its
various
instruments
of
law
and
opinion
of
education
and
domestic
influences
can
effect
this
object
so
far
will
it
promote
its
own
security
and
advancement
our
adoption
then
of
a
tendency
to
promote
social
welfare
or
as
the
test
of
conduct
is
justified
i
conceive
by
an
examination
of
the
internal
constitution
of
human
nature
and
of
the
conditions
which
are
necessary
to
secure
the
harmonious
working
of
its
various
parts
it
may
be
objected
that
this
test
is
vague
in
its
conception
and
difficult
in
its
application
both
objections
to
a
great
extent
hold
good
if
they
did
not
moral
theory
and
moral
practice
would
be
very
easy
matters
but
as
a
fact
we
know
that
they
are
by
no
means
easy
the
conception
of
social
must
be
more
or
less
vague
because
we
are
constantly
filling
it
up
by
experience
it
is
not
a
fixed
but
a
growing
conception
and
though
we
may
be
certain
of
the
character
and
importance
of
many
of
the
elements
which
have
already
been
detected
in
it
by
the
experience
of
past
generations
it
seems
impossible
to
fix
any
limits
to
its
development
in
the
future
history
of
mankind
man
will
constantly
be
discovering
new
wants
new
and
more
refined
susceptibilities
of
his
nature
and
with
them
his
conception
of
human
must
necessarily
grow
but
though
not
a
fixed
or
final
conception
the
idea
of
social
is
sufficiently
definite
in
each
generation
to
act
as
a
guide
and
incentive
to
conduct
it
is
the
star
gradually
growing
brighter
and
brighter
which
lights
our
path
and
any
way
we
know
that
if
it
were
not
above
us
in
the
heavens
we
should
be
walking
in
the
darkness
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
test
of
social
is
not
always
easy
of
application
even
when
we
know
what
the
good
of
the
community
consists
in
it
is
not
always
easy
to
say
what
course
of
action
will
promote
it
or
what
course
of
action
is
likely
to
retard
it
society
arrives
in
a
comparatively
early
period
of
its
development
at
certain
broad
rules
of
conduct
such
as
those
which
condemn
murder
theft
ingratitude
to
friends
disobedience
to
parents
but
the
more
remote
applications
of
these
rules
the
nicer
shades
of
conduct
such
as
those
relating
to
social
intercourse
the
choice
between
clashing
duties
the
realisation
of
our
obligations
to
the
community
at
large
require
for
their
appreciation
a
large
amount
of
intelligence
and
an
accumulated
stock
of
experience
which
are
not
to
be
found
in
primitive
societies
hence
the
rules
of
conduct
which
at
first
are
few
and
simple
gradually
become
more
numerous
and
complex
nor
have
we
yet
arrived
at
the
time
nor
do
we
seem
to
be
within
any
appreciable
distance
of
it
when
the
code
is
complete
or
even
the
parts
of
it
which
already
exist
are
altogether
free
from
doubt
and
discussion
in
the
simpler
relations
of
life
he
that
runs
may
read
but
with
increasing
complications
comes
increasing
uncertainty
to
remove
as
far
as
may
be
this
uncertainty
from
the
domain
of
conduct
is
the
task
of
advancing
civilisation
and
specially
of
those
members
of
a
community
who
have
sufficient
leisure
education
and
intelligence
to
review
the
motives
and
compare
the
results
of
actions
the
task
has
doubtless
its
special
difficulties
and
the
conclusions
of
the
moralist
will
by
no
means
always
command
assent
but
that
the
art
of
life
is
an
easy
one
who
is
there
at
all
experienced
in
affairs
or
accustomed
to
reflexion
that
will
contend
i
may
here
pause
for
a
moment
in
order
to
emphasise
the
fact
which
is
already
abundantly
apparent
from
what
has
preceded
that
with
ever
widening
and
deepening
conceptions
of
man
is
constantly
learning
to
subordinate
his
individual
interests
to
those
of
society
at
large
or
rather
to
identify
his
interests
with
those
of
the
larger
organism
of
which
he
is
a
part
it
is
thus
that
we
may
justify
the
peculiar
characteristic
of
the
moral
sentiment
indicated
in
the
last
chapter
which
seems
in
all
acts
of
which
it
approves
to
demand
an
element
of
sacrifice
whether
of
the
lower
to
the
higher
self
or
of
the
individual
to
his
fellows
in
order
thoroughly
to
realise
ourselves
we
must
be
conscious
of
our
absorption
or
at
least
of
our
inclusion
in
a
greater
and
grander
system
than
that
of
our
individual
surroundings
in
order
to
find
our
lives
we
must
first
discover
the
art
of
losing
them
chapter
practical
applications
of
the
moral
test
in
this
chapter
i
propose
without
any
attempt
to
be
exhaustive
or
systematic
to
give
some
examples
of
the
manner
in
which
the
test
of
conduct
may
be
applied
to
practical
questions
either
by
extending
existing
rules
to
cases
which
do
not
obviously
fall
under
them
or
by
suggesting
more
refined
maxims
of
conduct
than
those
which
are
commonly
prevalent
in
either
case
i
am
accepting
the
somewhat
invidious
task
of
pointing
out
defects
in
the
commonly
received
theory
or
the
commonly
approved
practice
of
morality
but
if
morality
is
progressive
as
i
contend
that
it
is
and
progresses
by
the
application
to
conduct
of
a
test
which
itself
involves
a
growing
conception
the
best
mode
of
exhibiting
the
application
of
that
test
will
be
in
the
more
recent
acquisitions
or
the
more
subtle
deductions
of
morality
rather
than
in
its
fundamental
rules
or
most
acknowledged
maxims
i
shall
begin
with
a
topic
the
examples
of
which
are
ready
to
hand
and
may
easily
be
multiplied
to
almost
any
extent
by
the
reader
for
himself
the
better
realisation
of
our
duties
to
society
at
large
as
distinct
from
particular
individuals
when
the
primary
mischief
resulting
from
a
wrong
act
falls
upon
individuals
and
especially
upon
our
neighbours
or
those
with
whom
we
are
constantly
associating
it
can
hardly
escape
our
observation
and
even
if
it
does
the
probability
is
that
our
attention
will
be
quickly
called
to
it
by
the
reprobation
of
others
but
when
the
consequences
of
the
act
are
diffused
over
the
whole
community
or
a
large
aggregate
of
persons
so
that
the
effect
on
each
individual
is
almost
imperceptible
we
are
very
apt
to
overlook
the
mischief
resulting
from
it
and
so
not
to
recognise
its
wrongful
character
while
at
the
same
time
from
lack
of
personal
interest
others
fail
to
call
us
to
account
hence
it
is
that
men
almost
without
any
thought
and
certainly
often
without
any
scruple
commit
offences
against
the
public
or
against
corporations
or
societies
or
companies
which
they
would
themselves
deem
it
impossible
for
them
to
commit
against
individuals
and
yet
the
character
of
the
acts
is
exactly
the
same
take
smuggling
a
man
smuggles
cigars
or
tobacco
to
an
amount
by
which
he
saves
himself
twenty
shillings
and
defrauds
the
state
to
the
same
extent
this
is
simply
an
act
of
theft
only
that
the
object
of
the
theft
is
the
community
at
large
and
not
an
individual
so
far
as
the
mischief
or
wrongfulness
of
the
act
goes
apart
from
the
intention
of
the
agent
he
might
as
well
put
his
hands
into
the
pocket
of
one
of
his
and
extract
the
same
amount
of
money
the
twenty
shillings
which
by
evading
payment
of
the
duty
he
has
appropriated
to
his
own
uses
has
been
taken
from
the
rest
of
the
and
he
has
simply
shifted
on
to
them
the
obligation
which
properly
attached
to
himself
sooner
or
later
they
must
make
up
the
deficit
if
many
men
were
to
act
in
the
same
way
the
burden
of
the
honest
would
be
largely
increased
and
if
the
practice
became
general
the
state
would
have
to
resort
to
some
other
mode
of
taxation
or
collect
its
at
a
most
disproportionate
cost
thus
a
little
reflexion
shows
that
smuggling
is
really
theft
and
i
can
not
but
think
that
it
would
be
to
the
moral
as
well
as
the
material
advantage
of
the
community
if
it
were
called
by
that
name
and
were
visited
with
the
same
punishment
as
petty
larceny
exactly
the
same
remarks
of
course
apply
to
the
evasion
of
or
of
rates
or
taxes
of
any
kind
which
are
imposed
by
a
legitimate
authority
travelling
on
a
railway
without
a
ticket
or
in
a
higher
class
or
for
a
greater
distance
than
that
for
which
the
ticket
was
taken
is
similarly
only
a
thinly
disguised
case
of
theft
and
should
be
treated
accordingly
the
sale
or
purchase
of
pirated
editions
of
books
is
another
case
of
the
same
kind
the
persons
from
whom
the
money
is
stolen
being
the
authors
or
publishers
many
paltry
acts
of
pilfering
such
as
the
unauthorised
use
of
or
franks
or
purloining
novels
or
from
a
club
or
plucking
flowers
in
a
public
garden
fall
under
the
same
head
of
real
though
not
always
obvious
thefts
there
is
of
course
a
certain
degree
of
pettiness
which
makes
them
insignificant
but
there
is
always
a
danger
lest
men
should
think
too
lightly
of
acts
of
this
kind
whether
done
by
themselves
or
others
the
best
safeguard
perhaps
against
thoughtless
to
the
community
or
large
social
aggregates
is
to
ask
ourselves
these
two
questions
should
we
commit
this
act
or
what
should
we
think
of
a
man
who
did
commit
it
in
the
case
of
a
private
individual
what
would
be
the
result
if
every
one
who
had
the
opportunity
were
to
do
the
same
many
of
these
acts
would
then
stand
out
in
their
true
light
and
we
should
recognise
that
they
are
not
only
mean
but
criminal
other
but
analogous
instances
of
the
failure
of
men
to
realise
their
obligations
to
society
or
to
large
social
aggregates
are
to
be
found
in
the
careless
and
perfunctory
manner
in
which
persons
employed
by
government
or
by
corporations
or
large
companies
often
perform
their
duties
if
they
were
in
the
service
of
a
private
employer
they
would
at
all
events
realise
even
if
they
did
not
act
on
their
conviction
that
they
were
defrauding
him
by
idling
away
their
time
or
attending
to
their
own
affairs
or
those
of
charities
or
institutions
in
which
they
were
interested
when
they
ought
to
be
attending
to
the
concerns
of
their
employer
but
in
a
government
or
municipal
office
or
the
establishment
of
a
large
company
no
one
in
particular
seems
to
be
injured
by
the
ineffective
discharge
of
their
functions
and
hence
it
does
not
occur
to
them
that
they
are
receiving
their
wages
without
rendering
the
equivalent
of
them
the
inadequate
supervision
which
overlooks
or
condones
this
listlessness
is
of
course
itself
also
the
result
of
a
similar
failure
to
realise
responsibility
the
spirit
in
which
patronage
is
often
administered
affords
an
instance
of
a
similar
kind
if
a
man
were
engaging
a
person
to
perform
some
service
for
himself
or
his
family
or
one
of
his
intimate
friends
he
would
simply
look
to
competency
including
perhaps
moral
character
for
the
special
work
to
be
done
but
when
he
has
to
appoint
to
a
public
post
and
especially
if
he
is
only
one
of
a
board
of
electors
he
is
very
apt
to
think
that
there
is
no
great
harm
in
appointing
or
voting
for
a
relative
or
friend
or
a
person
who
has
some
special
bond
of
connexion
with
him
such
as
that
of
political
party
though
he
may
not
be
the
candidate
best
qualified
for
the
position
and
if
it
does
occur
to
him
that
he
is
acting
wrongly
he
is
more
likely
to
think
of
the
wrong
which
he
is
doing
to
the
individual
who
possesses
the
highest
qualifications
and
to
him
it
is
an
undoubted
wrong
for
it
frustrates
just
expectations
than
of
the
wrong
which
he
is
doing
to
the
community
or
the
institution
which
he
is
depriving
of
the
services
of
the
fittest
man
and
yet
if
he
takes
the
trouble
to
reflect
he
must
see
that
he
is
guilty
of
a
breach
of
trust
that
having
undertaken
a
public
duty
he
has
abused
the
confidence
reposed
in
him
a
vote
given
in
return
for
a
bribe
a
case
which
now
seldom
occurs
except
in
parliamentary
elections
is
open
to
the
same
ethical
objections
as
a
vote
given
on
grounds
of
partiality
and
as
the
motive
which
dictates
the
breach
of
trust
is
purely
selfish
it
incurs
the
additional
reproach
of
meanness
but
why
it
may
be
asked
should
not
a
man
accept
a
bribe
if
on
other
grounds
he
would
vote
for
the
candidate
who
offers
it
simply
because
he
is
encouraging
a
practice
which
would
in
time
deprive
parliament
of
most
of
its
more
competent
members
and
reduce
it
to
an
oligarchy
of
millionaires
as
well
as
degrading
himself
by
a
sordid
act
to
receive
a
present
for
a
vote
even
if
the
vote
be
given
conscientiously
is
to
lend
countenance
to
a
practice
which
must
inevitably
corrupt
the
consciences
and
pervert
the
judgment
of
others
it
hardly
needs
to
be
pointed
out
that
the
man
who
offers
the
bribe
is
acting
still
more
immorally
than
the
man
who
accepts
it
he
is
not
only
causing
others
to
act
immorally
but
as
no
man
can
be
a
proper
judge
of
his
own
competency
he
is
attempting
to
thrust
himself
into
an
office
of
trust
without
any
regard
to
his
fitness
to
fill
it
intimidation
on
the
part
of
the
man
who
practises
it
is
on
the
same
ethical
level
as
bribery
with
respect
to
the
two
points
just
mentioned
but
as
it
appeals
to
the
fears
of
men
instead
of
their
love
of
gain
and
costs
nothing
to
him
who
employs
it
it
is
more
odious
and
deserves
at
the
hands
of
the
law
a
still
more
severe
punishment
to
yield
to
intimidation
is
under
most
circumstances
more
excusable
than
to
yield
to
bribery
for
the
fear
of
losing
what
one
has
is
to
most
men
a
more
powerful
inducement
than
the
hope
of
gaining
what
one
has
not
and
generally
speaking
the
penalty
threatened
by
the
intimidator
is
far
in
excess
of
the
advantage
offered
by
the
briber
as
it
betrays
a
vain
and
grasping
disposition
when
a
man
attempts
to
thrust
himself
into
an
office
to
which
he
is
not
called
by
the
spontaneous
voice
of
his
so
to
refuse
office
when
there
is
an
evident
opportunity
of
doing
good
service
to
the
community
betrays
pride
or
indolence
coupled
with
an
indifference
to
the
public
welfare
in
democratic
communities
there
is
always
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
what
may
be
called
superfine
persons
to
hold
aloof
from
public
and
especially
municipal
life
if
this
sentiment
of
fastidiousness
or
indifference
were
to
spread
widely
and
a
fashion
which
begins
in
one
social
stratum
quickly
permeates
to
those
immediately
below
it
there
would
be
great
danger
as
there
seems
to
be
in
america
of
the
public
administration
becoming
seriously
and
permanently
deteriorated
to
prevent
this
evil
it
is
desirable
to
create
in
every
community
a
strong
sentiment
against
the
practice
of
persons
who
have
the
requisite
means
leisure
and
ability
withholding
themselves
from
public
life
when
invited
by
their
to
take
their
part
in
it
there
may
of
course
be
paramount
claims
of
another
kind
such
as
those
of
science
or
art
or
literature
or
education
but
the
superior
importance
of
these
claims
on
the
individuals
themselves
where
they
obviously
exist
and
where
the
claims
of
the
public
service
are
not
urgent
would
readily
be
allowed
it
seems
to
be
a
rapid
transition
from
cases
of
this
kind
to
suicide
but
amongst
the
many
reasons
moral
and
religious
which
may
be
urged
against
suicide
there
is
one
which
connects
itself
closely
with
the
considerations
which
have
just
been
under
our
notice
as
pointed
out
long
ago
by
aristotle
the
suicide
wrongs
the
state
rather
than
himself
where
a
man
is
still
able
to
do
any
service
to
the
state
in
either
a
private
or
a
public
capacity
he
is
under
a
social
and
therefore
a
moral
obligation
to
perform
that
service
and
consequently
to
withdraw
from
it
by
a
voluntary
death
is
to
desert
the
post
of
duty
this
consideration
of
course
holds
only
where
a
man
life
is
still
of
value
to
society
but
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
where
this
ceases
to
be
the
case
many
other
considerations
often
and
some
always
do
intervene
there
are
few
men
who
have
not
relatives
friends
or
neighbours
who
will
be
pained
even
if
they
are
not
injured
materially
by
an
act
of
suicide
and
wherever
the
injury
is
a
material
one
as
in
the
case
of
leaving
helpless
relatives
unprovided
for
it
becomes
an
act
of
cruelty
then
under
all
circumstances
there
remain
the
evil
example
of
cowardice
and
to
those
who
acknowledge
the
obligations
of
religion
the
sin
of
cutting
short
the
period
of
probation
which
god
has
assigned
us
amongst
duties
to
society
which
are
seldom
fully
realised
in
their
social
aspect
is
the
duty
of
bringing
up
children
in
such
a
manner
as
to
render
them
useful
to
the
state
instead
of
a
burden
upon
it
under
this
head
there
are
two
distinct
cases
that
of
the
rich
and
that
of
the
poor
or
more
precisely
that
of
those
who
are
in
sufficiently
good
circumstances
to
educate
their
children
without
the
assistance
of
the
state
or
of
their
neighbours
and
that
of
those
who
require
such
assistance
in
the
latter
case
it
is
the
duty
of
society
to
with
the
parent
in
giving
the
child
an
education
which
shall
fit
it
for
the
industrial
occupations
of
life
and
hence
the
moral
obligation
on
the
richer
members
of
a
community
to
provide
elementary
schools
aided
by
the
state
or
by
some
smaller
political
aggregate
or
else
by
voluntary
efforts
the
object
of
this
assistance
is
not
so
much
charity
to
the
parent
or
the
individual
children
as
the
prevention
of
crime
and
pauperism
and
the
supply
of
an
orderly
and
competent
industrial
class
in
rendering
the
assistance
whether
it
come
from
public
or
private
funds
great
care
ought
to
be
taken
not
to
weaken
but
rather
to
stimulate
the
interest
of
the
parent
in
the
child
progress
both
by
assigning
to
him
a
share
of
the
responsibility
of
supervision
and
if
possible
by
compelling
him
to
contribute
an
equitable
proportion
of
the
cost
so
largely
if
not
so
fully
are
the
duties
of
the
state
and
of
individuals
of
the
wealthier
classes
in
the
matter
of
educating
the
children
of
the
poor
now
recognised
that
the
dangers
arising
from
a
defective
or
injudicious
education
seem
in
the
immediate
future
to
threaten
the
richer
rather
than
the
poorer
classes
and
the
encouragement
of
luxurious
habits
during
childhood
the
weakened
sense
of
responsibility
on
the
part
of
the
parent
which
is
often
caused
by
the
transference
to
others
of
authority
and
supervision
during
boyhood
or
girlhood
the
undue
stimulation
of
the
love
of
amusement
or
of
the
craving
for
material
comforts
during
the
opening
years
of
manhood
or
womanhood
the
failure
to
create
serious
interests
or
teach
adequately
the
social
responsibilities
which
wealth
and
position
bring
with
them
all
these
mistakes
or
defects
in
the
education
of
the
children
of
the
upper
classes
constitute
a
grave
peril
to
society
unless
they
are
remedied
in
time
it
seems
so
far
as
we
can
forecast
the
future
that
it
is
only
by
all
classes
taking
pains
to
ascertain
their
respective
duties
and
functions
in
sustaining
and
promoting
the
of
the
community
and
making
serious
efforts
to
perform
them
that
the
society
of
the
next
few
generations
can
be
saved
from
constant
convulsions
as
intelligence
expands
and
a
sense
of
the
importance
of
social
becomes
diffused
it
is
almost
certain
that
the
existence
of
a
merely
idle
and
class
will
no
longer
be
tolerated
hence
it
is
as
much
to
the
interests
of
the
wealthier
classes
themselves
as
of
society
at
large
that
their
children
should
be
educated
with
a
full
sense
of
their
social
responsibilities
and
equipped
with
all
the
moral
and
intellectual
aptitudes
which
are
requisite
to
enable
them
to
take
a
lead
in
the
development
of
the
community
of
which
they
are
members
and
here
perhaps
i
may
take
occasion
to
draw
attention
to
the
importance
of
the
acquisition
of
political
knowledge
by
all
citizens
of
the
state
and
especially
by
those
who
belong
to
the
leisured
classes
it
is
a
plain
duty
to
society
that
men
should
not
exercise
political
power
unless
they
have
some
knowledge
of
the
questions
at
issue
the
amount
of
this
knowledge
may
vary
almost
infinitely
from
that
of
the
veteran
statesman
to
that
of
the
newly
enfranchised
elector
but
it
is
within
the
power
of
every
one
who
can
observe
and
reason
to
acquire
some
knowledge
of
at
least
the
questions
which
affect
his
own
employment
and
the
welfare
of
his
own
family
and
neighbourhood
and
unless
he
will
take
thus
much
pains
he
might
surely
have
the
modesty
to
forego
his
vote
to
record
a
vote
simply
to
please
some
one
else
is
only
one
degree
baser
than
to
barter
it
for
money
or
money
worth
and
indeed
it
is
often
only
an
indirect
mode
of
doing
the
same
thing
there
is
a
large
class
of
cases
primarily
affecting
individuals
rather
than
society
at
large
which
if
we
look
a
little
below
the
surface
and
trace
their
results
are
of
a
much
more
pernicious
character
than
is
usually
recognised
and
as
ethical
knowledge
increases
ought
to
incur
far
more
severe
reprobation
than
they
now
do
foremost
amongst
these
is
what
i
may
call
the
current
morality
of
debts
a
man
incurs
a
debt
with
a
tradesman
which
he
has
no
intention
or
no
reasonable
prospect
of
paying
knowing
that
the
tradesman
has
no
grounds
for
suspecting
his
inability
to
pay
the
tradesman
parts
with
the
goods
supposing
that
he
will
receive
the
equivalent
the
customer
carries
them
off
knowing
that
this
equivalent
is
not
and
is
not
likely
to
be
forthcoming
i
confess
that
i
am
entirely
unable
to
distinguish
this
case
from
that
of
ordinary
theft
and
still
there
is
many
a
man
well
received
in
society
who
habitually
acts
in
this
manner
and
whose
practice
must
be
more
than
suspected
by
his
friends
and
associates
he
and
his
friends
would
be
much
astonished
if
he
were
accosted
as
a
thief
and
still
i
can
not
see
how
he
could
reasonably
repudiate
this
title
short
of
this
extreme
case
which
however
is
by
no
means
uncommon
there
are
many
degrees
of
what
may
be
called
criminal
negligence
or
imprudence
in
contracting
debts
as
where
a
man
runs
up
a
large
bill
with
only
a
slender
probability
of
meeting
it
or
a
larger
bill
than
he
can
probably
meet
in
full
or
one
of
which
he
must
defer
the
payment
beyond
a
reasonable
time
in
all
these
cases
which
are
much
aggravated
if
the
goods
obtained
are
luxuries
and
not
necessaries
for
it
is
one
of
the
plainest
duties
of
every
man
who
is
removed
from
absolute
want
to
live
within
his
means
there
is
either
actual
dishonesty
or
a
dangerous
approximation
to
it
and
it
would
be
a
great
advance
in
morality
if
society
were
to
recognise
this
fact
distinctly
and
apportion
its
censures
accordingly
where
the
tradesman
knows
that
he
is
running
a
risk
the
customer
being
also
aware
that
he
knows
it
and
adapts
his
charges
to
the
fact
it
is
a
case
of
meet
greek
and
even
if
the
customer
deserves
reprobation
the
tradesman
certainly
deserves
no
compassion
but
this
is
a
case
outside
the
range
of
honest
dealing
altogether
and
must
be
regulated
by
other
sentiments
and
other
laws
than
those
which
prevail
in
ordinary
commerce
there
is
another
and
to
many
men
only
too
familiar
exception
to
the
ordinary
relation
of
debtor
and
creditor
a
friend
money
of
you
though
it
is
understood
on
both
sides
that
he
will
have
no
opportunity
of
repaying
it
and
that
it
is
virtually
a
gift
here
as
the
creditor
does
not
expect
any
repayment
and
the
debtor
knows
that
he
does
not
there
is
no
act
of
dishonesty
but
the
debtor
by
asking
for
a
loan
and
not
a
gift
evades
the
obligation
of
gratitude
and
reciprocal
service
which
would
attach
to
the
latter
and
thus
takes
a
certain
advantage
of
his
benefactor
in
this
case
it
would
be
far
more
straightforward
even
if
it
involved
some
humiliation
to
use
plain
words
and
to
accept
at
once
the
true
position
of
a
recipient
and
not
affect
the
seeming
one
of
a
borrower
connected
with
the
subject
of
debtor
and
creditor
is
the
ungrounded
notion
to
which
i
have
already
adverted
that
the
payment
of
what
are
called
debts
of
honour
ought
to
take
precedence
of
all
other
pecuniary
obligations
as
these
of
honour
generally
arise
from
bets
or
play
or
loans
contracted
with
friends
the
position
assumed
is
simply
that
debts
incurred
to
members
of
our
own
class
or
persons
whom
we
know
place
us
under
a
greater
obligation
than
debts
incurred
to
strangers
or
persons
belonging
to
a
lower
grade
in
society
as
thus
stated
the
maxim
is
evidently
preposterous
and
indefensible
and
affords
a
good
instance
as
i
have
noticed
in
a
previous
chapter
of
the
subordination
of
the
laws
of
general
morality
to
the
convenience
and
prejudices
of
particular
cliques
and
classes
if
there
is
any
competition
at
all
admissible
between
just
debts
surely
those
which
have
been
incurred
in
return
for
commodities
supplied
have
a
stronger
claim
than
those
arising
from
play
or
bets
which
represent
no
sacrifice
on
the
part
of
the
creditor
another
instance
of
the
class
of
cases
which
i
am
now
considering
is
to
be
found
in
reckless
gambling
men
who
indulge
in
this
practice
are
usually
condemned
as
being
simply
or
foolish
but
if
we
look
a
little
below
the
surface
we
shall
find
that
their
conduct
is
often
highly
criminal
many
a
time
a
man
risks
on
play
or
a
bet
or
a
or
a
transaction
on
the
stock
exchange
the
permanent
welfare
sometimes
even
the
very
subsistence
of
his
wife
and
children
or
others
depending
on
him
or
if
he
loses
he
cuts
short
a
career
of
future
usefulness
or
he
renders
himself
unable
to
develope
or
perhaps
even
to
retain
his
business
or
his
estates
and
so
involves
his
tenants
or
clerks
or
workmen
in
his
ruin
or
perhaps
he
becomes
bankrupt
and
is
thus
the
cause
of
misery
amongst
his
creditors
and
even
if
these
extreme
results
do
not
follow
his
rash
conduct
may
be
the
cause
of
much
minor
suffering
amongst
his
relatives
or
tradesmen
or
dependents
who
may
have
to
forego
many
legitimate
enjoyments
in
consequence
of
his
one
act
of
greed
or
thoughtlessness
while
in
all
cases
he
is
encouraging
by
his
example
a
practice
which
if
not
his
own
ruin
is
certain
to
be
the
ruin
of
others
the
with
which
many
a
man
risks
his
whole
fortune
and
the
welfare
of
all
who
are
dependent
on
him
for
what
would
if
gained
be
no
great
addition
to
his
happiness
is
a
striking
example
of
the
frequent
blindness
of
men
to
all
results
except
those
which
are
removed
but
one
step
from
their
actions
a
gamester
however
sanguine
sees
that
he
may
lose
his
money
but
he
does
not
see
all
the
ill
consequences
to
himself
and
others
which
the
loss
of
his
money
will
involve
hence
an
act
which
if
we
look
to
the
intention
is
often
only
thoughtless
becomes
in
result
criminal
and
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
society
by
its
reprobation
should
make
men
realise
what
the
true
nature
of
such
actions
is
i
pass
now
to
a
case
of
a
different
character
which
has
only
within
recent
years
begun
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
moralist
and
politician
at
all
the
peril
to
life
and
health
ensuing
on
the
neglect
of
sanitary
precautions
a
man
carelessly
neglects
his
drains
or
allows
a
mass
of
filth
to
accumulate
in
his
yard
or
uses
without
testing
its
qualities
or
ascertaining
its
surroundings
after
a
time
a
fever
breaks
out
in
his
household
and
perhaps
communicates
itself
to
his
neighbours
the
result
being
several
deaths
and
much
sickness
and
suffering
these
deaths
and
this
suffering
are
the
direct
result
of
his
negligence
and
though
it
would
doubtless
be
hard
and
unjust
to
call
him
a
murderer
he
is
this
in
effect
of
course
if
notwithstanding
warning
or
reflexion
he
persists
in
his
negligence
with
a
full
consciousness
of
the
results
which
may
possibly
ensue
from
it
he
incurs
a
grave
moral
responsibility
and
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
a
case
more
fit
for
censure
or
even
punishment
nor
are
the
members
of
a
corporation
or
a
board
in
the
administration
of
an
area
of
which
they
have
undertaken
the
charge
less
guilty
under
these
circumstances
than
is
a
private
individual
in
the
management
of
his
own
premises
if
men
were
properly
instructed
in
the
results
of
their
actions
or
pretermissions
in
matters
of
this
nature
and
made
fully
conscious
of
the
responsibility
which
those
results
entail
upon
them
there
would
soon
be
a
marked
decrease
in
physical
suffering
disease
and
premature
deaths
the
average
duration
of
life
in
civilized
countries
has
probably
already
been
lengthened
by
the
increased
knowledge
and
the
increased
sense
of
responsibility
which
have
even
now
been
attained
closely
connected
with
these
considerations
on
the
diminution
of
death
disease
and
suffering
by
improved
sanitary
arrangements
is
the
delicate
subject
of
the
propagation
of
hereditary
disease
it
is
a
commonplace
that
the
most
important
of
all
the
acts
of
life
is
that
on
which
men
and
women
venture
most
thoughtlessly
but
experience
shews
unmistakably
that
there
are
many
forms
of
disease
both
mental
and
bodily
which
are
transmitted
from
the
parents
to
the
children
and
that
consequently
the
marriage
of
a
diseased
parent
or
of
a
parent
with
a
tendency
to
disease
will
probably
be
followed
by
the
existence
of
diseased
children
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
everything
of
course
depends
on
the
amount
of
the
risk
incurred
that
is
to
say
on
the
extent
of
the
evil
and
the
probability
of
its
transmission
the
former
of
these
data
is
supplied
by
common
observation
the
latter
by
the
researches
of
the
pathologist
it
is
for
the
moralist
simply
to
draw
attention
to
the
subject
and
to
insist
on
the
responsibility
attaching
to
a
knowledge
of
it
the
marriages
of
persons
who
are
very
poor
and
have
no
reasonable
prospect
of
bringing
up
children
in
health
decency
and
comfort
are
open
to
similar
considerations
but
as
in
the
last
case
i
must
content
myself
with
simply
adverting
to
the
responsibility
attaching
to
them
and
noting
the
extent
to
which
that
responsibility
is
usually
ignored
in
connexion
with
this
question
it
may
be
added
that
many
of
the
attempts
made
by
people
to
alleviate
poverty
and
distress
have
unfortunately
too
often
the
effect
of
ultimately
aggravating
those
evils
by
diverting
attention
from
their
real
causes
a
not
unnatural
reluctance
to
discuss
or
reflect
on
matters
of
this
delicate
character
combined
with
the
survival
of
maxims
and
sentiments
derived
from
an
entirely
different
condition
of
society
are
doubtless
to
a
great
extent
the
reasons
of
the
backward
condition
of
morality
on
this
subject
the
importance
from
a
social
point
of
view
of
the
careful
education
of
children
with
reference
to
their
future
position
in
life
has
already
been
considered
but
in
connexion
with
the
class
of
duties
i
am
now
treating
i
may
draw
attention
to
the
obligation
under
which
parents
lie
in
this
respect
to
their
children
themselves
the
ancient
morality
which
was
the
product
of
the
patriarchal
form
of
society
when
the
was
still
in
vigour
laid
peculiar
stress
on
the
duties
of
children
to
parents
while
it
almost
ignored
the
reciprocal
duties
of
parents
to
children
when
the
members
of
a
family
were
seldom
separated
and
the
pressure
of
population
had
not
yet
begun
to
be
felt
this
was
the
natural
order
of
ideas
with
respect
to
the
parental
relation
but
now
that
the
common
labour
of
the
household
is
replaced
by
competition
amongst
individuals
and
most
young
men
and
women
have
at
an
early
age
to
leave
their
families
and
set
about
earning
their
own
living
or
carving
out
their
own
career
it
is
obvious
on
reflexion
that
parents
are
guilty
of
a
gross
breach
of
duty
if
they
do
not
use
their
utmost
endeavours
to
facilitate
the
introduction
of
their
children
to
the
active
work
of
life
and
to
fit
them
for
the
circumstances
in
which
they
are
likely
to
be
placed
to
bring
up
a
son
or
daughter
in
idleness
or
ignorance
ought
to
be
as
great
a
reproach
to
a
parent
as
it
is
to
a
child
to
dishonour
its
father
or
mother
and
yet
in
the
upper
and
middle
classes
at
all
events
there
are
many
parents
who
without
incurring
much
reprobation
from
their
friends
prefer
to
treat
their
children
like
playthings
or
pet
animals
rather
than
to
take
the
pains
to
train
them
with
a
view
to
their
future
trials
and
duties
it
ought
to
be
thoroughly
realised
and
as
the
moral
consciousness
becomes
better
adapted
to
the
existing
circumstances
of
society
it
is
to
be
trusted
that
it
will
be
realised
that
parents
have
no
moral
right
to
do
what
they
choose
with
their
children
but
that
they
are
under
a
strict
obligation
both
to
society
and
to
their
children
themselves
so
to
mould
their
dispositions
and
develope
their
faculties
and
inform
their
minds
and
train
their
bodies
as
to
render
them
good
and
useful
citizens
and
honest
and
skilful
men
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
some
day
people
will
regard
with
as
much
surprise
the
notion
that
parents
have
a
right
to
neglect
the
education
of
their
children
as
we
now
regard
with
wonder
when
we
first
hear
of
it
the
maxim
of
archaic
law
that
a
parent
had
a
right
to
put
his
child
to
death
much
of
the
trouble
vexation
and
misery
of
which
men
are
the
cause
to
themselves
is
due
to
cowardice
or
the
false
shame
which
results
from
attaching
undue
importance
to
custom
fashion
or
the
opinion
of
others
even
when
that
opinion
is
not
confirmed
by
their
own
reflexion
shame
is
an
invaluable
protection
to
men
as
a
restraining
feeling
but
the
objects
to
which
it
properly
attaches
are
unkindness
discourtesy
to
others
and
as
regards
ourselves
ignorance
imprudence
intemperance
impurity
and
avoidable
defects
or
misfortunes
while
it
confines
itself
to
objects
such
as
these
it
is
one
of
the
sternest
and
at
the
same
time
most
effective
guardians
of
virtue
and
but
as
soon
as
a
man
begins
to
care
about
what
others
will
say
of
circumstances
not
under
his
own
control
such
as
his
race
his
origin
his
appearance
his
physical
defects
or
his
lack
of
wealth
or
natural
talents
he
may
be
laying
up
for
himself
a
store
of
incalculable
misery
and
is
certainly
enfeebling
his
character
and
impairing
his
chances
of
future
usefulness
it
is
under
the
influence
of
this
motive
for
instance
that
many
a
man
lives
above
his
income
not
for
the
purpose
of
gratifying
any
real
wants
either
of
himself
or
his
family
but
for
the
sake
of
up
appearances
though
he
is
exposing
his
creditors
to
considerable
losses
his
family
to
many
probable
disadvantages
and
himself
to
almost
certain
disgrace
in
the
future
it
is
under
the
influence
of
this
motive
too
that
many
men
in
the
upper
and
middle
classes
rather
than
marry
on
a
modest
income
and
drop
out
of
the
society
of
their
fashionable
acquaintance
form
irregular
sexual
connexions
which
are
a
source
of
injury
to
themselves
and
ruin
to
their
victims
a
circumstance
which
has
probably
contributed
largely
in
recent
times
to
aggravate
the
feeling
of
false
shame
is
the
new
departure
which
in
commercial
communities
has
been
taken
by
the
old
line
which
formed
a
sharp
separation
between
the
nobility
and
all
other
classes
has
been
almost
effaced
and
in
its
place
have
been
substituted
many
shades
of
difference
between
different
grades
of
society
together
with
a
broad
line
of
demarcation
between
what
may
be
called
the
genteel
and
the
ungenteel
classes
it
was
a
certain
advantage
of
the
old
line
that
it
could
not
be
passed
and
hence
though
there
might
be
some
jealousy
felt
towards
the
nobility
as
a
class
there
were
none
of
the
which
attach
to
an
uncertain
position
or
a
futile
effort
to
rise
in
modern
society
on
the
other
hand
there
is
hardly
any
one
whose
position
is
so
fixed
that
he
may
not
easily
rise
above
or
fall
below
it
and
hence
there
is
constant
room
for
social
ambition
social
disappointment
and
social
jealousy
again
the
broad
line
of
gentility
which
now
corresponds
most
closely
with
the
old
distinction
of
nobility
is
determined
by
such
a
number
of
considerations
birth
connexions
means
manners
education
with
the
arbitrary
though
almost
essential
condition
of
not
being
engaged
in
retail
trade
that
those
who
are
just
excluded
by
it
are
apt
to
feel
their
position
somewhat
unintelligible
and
therefore
all
the
more
galling
to
their
pride
and
it
would
be
curious
to
ascertain
what
proportion
of
the
minor
inconveniences
and
vexations
of
modern
life
is
due
to
the
perplexity
on
the
one
side
and
the
soreness
on
the
other
created
by
the
exclusiveness
of
that
these
distinctions
are
an
evil
in
themselves
there
can
i
think
be
no
doubt
men
can
not
of
course
all
know
one
another
much
less
be
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
one
another
and
the
degree
of
their
acquaintance
or
intimacy
will
always
be
largely
dependent
on
community
of
tastes
interests
occupations
and
early
associations
but
these
facts
afford
no
reason
why
one
set
of
men
should
look
down
with
superciliousness
and
disdain
on
another
set
of
men
who
have
not
enjoyed
the
same
early
advantages
or
are
not
at
present
endowed
with
the
same
gifts
or
accomplishments
as
themselves
or
why
they
should
hold
aloof
from
them
when
there
is
any
opportunity
of
common
action
or
social
intercourse
the
pride
of
class
is
eminently
unreasonable
and
in
those
who
profess
to
believe
in
christianity
inconsistent
it
will
always
probably
continue
to
exist
but
we
may
hope
that
it
will
be
progressively
modified
by
the
advance
of
education
by
the
spread
of
social
sympathy
and
by
a
growing
habit
of
reflexion
the
ideal
social
condition
would
be
one
in
which
though
men
continued
to
form
themselves
into
groups
no
one
thought
the
worse
or
the
more
lightly
of
another
because
he
belonged
to
a
different

himself

moralist
in
these
cases

point
out
how
the

is

aggregate
of
men
is
as
such
always
an
ennobling
and
inspiriting
sentiment
and
that
unless
it
plainly
detach
them
from
the
rest
of
the
community
and
is
attended
with
pernicious
consequences
to
society
at
large
it
is
unwise
if
not
reckless
to
seek
to
impair
it
to
descend
to
a
subject
of
less
though
still
of
considerable
importance
i
may
notice
that
cowardice
and
fear
of
people
will
say
lies
at
the
bottom
of
much
charity
and
of
that
facility
with
which
men
often
to
the
injury
of
themselves
or
their
families
if
not
of
the
very
objects
pleaded
for
listen
to
the
solicitations
of
the
inconsiderate
or
interested
it
has
now
become
a
truism
that
enormous
mischief
is
done
by
the
indiscriminate
distribution
of
alms
to
beggars
or
paupers
it
is
no
less
true
though
not
so
obvious
that
much
unintentional
harm
is
often
done
by
subscriptions
for
what
are
called
public
objects
people
ought
to
have
sufficient
mental
independence
to
ask
themselves
what
will
be
the
ultimate
effects
of
subscribing
their
money
and
if
they
honestly
believe
that
those
effects
will
be
pernicious
or
of
doubtful
utility
they
ought
to
have
the
courage
to
refuse
it
there
is
no
good
reason
simply
because
a
man
asks
me
and
i
find
that
others
are
yielding
to
him
why
i
should
subscribe
a
guinea
towards
disfiguring
a
church
or
erecting
an
ugly
and
useless
building
or
extending
pauperism
or
encouraging
the
growth
of
luxurious
habits
or
spreading
opinions
which
i
do
not
believe
and
i
may
be
the
more
emboldened
in
my
refusal
when
i
consider
how
mixed
or
how
selfish
are
often
the
motives
of
those
who
solicit
me
and
that
the
love
of
notoriety
or
the
gratification
of
a
feeling
of
or
a
fussy
restlessness
or
the
craving
for
preferment
is
frequently
quite
as
powerful
an
incentive
of
their
activity
as
a
desire
to
promote
the
objects
explicitly
avowed
there
is
moreover
an
important
consideration
connected
with
this
subject
which
often
escapes
notice
namely
the
extent
to
which
new
and
multiplied
appeals
to
charity
often
interfere
with
older
nearer
and
more
pressing
claims
thus
the
managers
of
the
local
hospital
or
dispensary
or
charity
organisation
have
often
too
good
cause
to
regret
the
enthusiastic
philanthropy
which
is
sending
help
of
questionable
utility
to
distant
parts
of
the
world
people
can
not
subscribe
to
everything
and
they
are
too
apt
to
fall
in
with
the
most
recent
and
most
fashionable
movement
in
venturing
on
these
remarks
i
trust
it
is
needless
to
say
that
i
am
far
from
deprecating
the
general
practice
of
subscribing
to
charities
and
public
objects
a
form
of
which
has
been
rendered
indispensable
by
the
habits
and
circumstances
of
modern
life
i
am
simply
insisting
on
the
importance
and
responsibility
of
ascertaining
whether
the
aims
proposed
are
likely
to
be
productive
of
good
or
evil
and
deprecating
the
cowardice
or
listlessness
which
yields
to
a
solicitation
irrespectively
of
the
merits
of
the
proposal
these
solicitations
often
take
the
offensive
form
which
is
intentionally
embarrassing
to
the
person
solicited
of
an
appeal
to
relieve
the
purveyor
of
the
himself
from
the
obligation
incurred
by
a
the
issue
is
thus
ingeniously
and
unfairly
transferred
from
the
claims
of
the
object
which
it
is
designed
to
promote
to
the
question
of
relieving
a
friend
or
a
neighbour
from
a
heavy
pecuniary
obligation
you
will
never
allow
me
to
pay
all
this
money
myself
but
why
not
unless
i
approve
of
the
object
and
even
if
i
do
why
should
i
increase
my
subscription
on
account
of
an
obligation
voluntarily
incurred
by
you
without
any
encouragement
from
me
in
a
case
of
this
kind
the
ought
to
be
regarded
as
simply
irrelevant
and
the
question
decided
solely
on
the
merits
of
the
result
to
be
attained
of
course
i
must
be
understood
to
be
speaking
here
only
of
those
cases
in
which
the
is
used
as
an
additional
argument
for
eliciting
subscriptions
not
of
those
cases
in
which
for
convenience
sake
or
in
order
to
secure
celerity
of
execution
a
few
wealthy
persons
generously
advance
the
whole
sum
required
for
a
project
being
quite
willing
to
pay
it
themselves
unless
they
meet
with
ready
and
cheerful
in
the
department
of
social
intercourse
there
are
several
applications
of
existing
moral
principles
and
specially
of
the
softer
virtues
of
kindness
courtesy
and
consideration
for
others
the
observance
of
which
would
sensibly
sweeten
our
relations
to
our
and
to
persons
of
a
sensitive
temperament
render
life
far
more
agreeable
and
better
worth
living
than
it
actually
is
a
few
of
these
applications
i
shall
attempt
to
point
out
amongst
savage
races
and
in
the
less
polished
ranks
of
civilized
life
men
who
disagree
or
have
any
grudge
against
one
another
resort
to
physical
blows
or
coarse
invective
in
polite
and
educated
circles
these
weapons
are
replaced
by
sarcasm
and
innuendo
there
are
of
course
many
advantages
gained
by
the
substitution
of
this
more
refined
mode
of
warfare
but
the
mere
fact
that
the
intellectual
skill
which
it
displays
gives
pleasure
to
the
bystanders
and
wins
social
applause
renders
its
employment
far
more
frequent
than
on
cool
reflexion
could
be
justified
by
the
occasions
for
it
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
gives
pain
often
intense
pain
especially
where
the
victim
is
not
ready
enough
to
retaliate
effectively
in
kind
and
there
can
be
no
more
justification
for
inflicting
this
peculiar
kind
of
pain
than
any
other
unless
the
circumstances
are
such
as
to
demand
it
any
one
who
will
take
the
trouble
to
analyse
his
acts
and
motives
will
generally
find
when
he
employs
these
weapons
that
he
is
actuated
not
so
much
by
any
desire
to
reform
the
object
of
his
attack
or
to
deter
by
these
means
him
or
others
from
as
by
a
desire
to
show
off
his
own
cleverness
and
to
leave
behind
him
a
mark
of
his
power
in
the
smart
which
he
inflicts
these
unamiable
motives
are
least
justifiable
when
the
victim
is
a
social
inferior
or
a
person
who
by
his
age
or
position
is
unable
to
retaliate
on
equal
terms
to
vanity
and
cruelty
are
then
added
cowardice
and
though
all
these
vices
may
only
be
displayed
on
a
very
small
scale
they
are
none
the
less
really
present
it
may
be
laid
down
however
difficult
with
our
present
social
habits
it
may
be
to
keep
the
rule
that
sarcasm
should
never
be
employed
except
deliberately
and
as
a
punishment
and
that
for
innuendo
if
justifiable
by
facts
men
should
always
have
the
courage
to
substitute
direct
assertion
of
the
minor
social
vices
one
of
the
commonest
is
a
disregard
in
conversation
of
other
persons
feelings
men
who
lay
claim
to
the
character
of
gentlemen
are
specially
bound
to
shew
their
tact
and
delicacy
of
feeling
by
avoiding
all
subjects
which
have
a
disagreeable
personal
reference
or
are
likely
to
revive
unpleasant
associations
in
the
minds
of
any
of
those
who
are
present
and
yet
these
are
qualities
which
are
often
strangely
conspicuous
by
their
absence
even
in
educated
and
cultivated
society
one
of
the
most
repulsive
and
least
excusable
forms
which
this
indifference
to
other
persons
feelings
takes
is
in
impertinent
curiosity
there
are
some
people
who
for
the
sake
of
satisfying
a
purposeless
curiosity
will
ask
questions
which
they
know
it
can
not
be
agreeable
to
answer
in
all
cases
curiosity
of
this
kind
is
evidence
of
want
of
real
refinement
and
is
a
breach
of
the
finer
rules
of
social
morality
but
when
the
questions
asked
are
intended
to
extract
directly
or
indirectly
unwilling
information
on
a
private
life
or
circumstances
they
assume
the
character
of
sheer
vulgarity
a
man
private
affairs
providing
his
conduct
of
them
does
not
injuriously
affect
society
are
no
one
business
but
his
own
and
much
pain
and
vexation
of
the
smaller
kind
would
be
saved
if
this
very
plain
fact
were
duly
recognised
in
social
intercourse
it
may
be
noticed
in
passing
that
there
still
lingers
on
in
society
a
minor
form
of
persecution
a
sort
of
inquisition
on
a
small
scale
which
consists
in
attempting
to
extract
from
a
man
a
frank
statement
of
his
religious
social
or
political
opinions
though
it
is
known
or
suspected
all
the
time
that
if
he
responds
to
the
invitation
it
will
be
to
his
social
or
material
disadvantage
in
cases
of
this
kind
it
becomes
a
casuistical
question
how
far
a
man
is
called
on
to
disclose
his
real
sentiments
at
the
bidding
of
any
impertinent
questioner
that
the
free
expression
of
opinion
should
be
attended
with
this
danger
is
of
course
a
proof
how
far
removed
we
still
are
from
perfect
intellectual
toleration
impertinent
curiosity
is
offensive
not
only
because
it
shews
an
indifference
to
the
feelings
of
the
person
questioned
but
because
it
savours
of
gratuitous
interference
in
his
affairs
this
quality
it
shares
with
another
of
the
minor
social
vices
the
tendering
of
unasked
for
advice
or
in
brief
impertinent
advice
there
are
certain
circumstances
and
relations
in
which
men
have
the
right
even
if
they
are
not
under
the
obligation
to
give
unsolicited
advice
as
where
a
man
is
incurring
an
unknown
danger
or
foregoing
some
unsuspected
advantage
or
to
their
servants
or
children
or
wards
or
pupils
but
in
all
these
cases
either
the
special
circumstance
or
the
special
relation
implies
superiority
of
knowledge
or
superiority
of
position
on
the
part
of
the
person
tendering
the
advice
and
to
assume
this
superiority
where
it
does
not
plainly
exist
is
an
act
of
impertinence
just
as
the
assumption
of
superiority
wounds
a
man
so
does
the
disposition
to
meddle
in
his
affairs
which
is
generally
founded
on
that
assumption
affect
his
sense
of
independence
and
hence
an
act
which
includes
both
grounds
of
offence
seems
to
be
a
peculiarly
legitimate
object
of
resentment
the
lesson
of
letting
other
people
alone
is
one
which
men
are
slow
to
learn
though
there
are
few
who
in
their
own
case
do
not
resent
any
attack
on
their
liberty
of
judgment
or
action
this
is
emphatically
one
of
the
cases
in
which
we
should
try
to
put
ourselves
in
the
place
of
others
and
act
to
them
as
we
would
that
they
should
act
towards
us
excessive
and
often
criticism
of
others
is
one
of
the
minor
vices
which
seem
to
grow
up
with
advancing
civilisation
and
intelligence
rather
than
to
retreat
before
them
it
seems
as
a
rule
to
prevail
much
more
in
educated
than
in
uneducated
society
the
reason
is
not
difficult
to
find
education
naturally
makes
men
more
fastidious
and
more
keenly
alive
to
the
defects
of
those
with
whom
they
associate
and
then
when
educated
men
converse
together
they
are
apt
merely
from
the
facility
with
which
they
deal
with
language
to
express
in
an
exaggerated
form
the
unfavourable
estimate
which
they
have
formed
of
others
especially
if
this
exaggerated
form
can
be
compressed
into
an
epigram
but
it
requires
little
reflexion
to
see
that
this
keen
and
exaggerated
habit
of
criticism
must
be
productive
of
much
discomfort
in
a
society
in
which
it
is
general
and
that
when
applied
to
literary
work
even
though
it
may
be
a
protection
against
inaccuracy
and
breaches
of
taste
it
must
be
a
great
discouragement
to
the
young
and
repressive
of
much
honest
and
valuable
effort
to
restrain
the
critical
spirit
whether
applied
to
mind
or
conduct
with
proper
limits
it
is
necessary
keeping
these
considerations
in
view
to
ask
how
much
we
can
reasonably
or
profitably
require
of
men
and
above
all
never
to
lose
that
sympathetic
touch
with
others
which
renders
us
as
keenly
alive
to
their
difficulties
as
their
errors
to
their
aspirations
as
their
failure
to
fulfil
them
i
shall
say
nothing
here
of
detraction
backbiting
or
malicious
representation
because
these
are
social
vices
which
are
too
obvious
and
too
generally
acknowledged
to
be
of
any
service
as
illustrations
of
those
extensions
or
new
applications
of
morality
which
i
have
in
view
in
the
present
chapter
i
may
however
notice
in
passing
that
the
invention
or
exaggeration
of
stories
which
have
a
tendency
to
bring
men
into
ridicule
or
contempt
is
a
practice
which
from
the
entertainment
it
affords
is
too
easily
tolerated
by
society
and
usually
fails
to
meet
with
the
reprobation
it
deserves
i
shall
advert
to
only
one
other
topic
namely
the
treatment
of
the
lower
animals
with
rare
exceptions
it
is
only
of
late
that
this
subject
has
been
regarded
as
falling
within
the
sphere
of
ethics
and
it
is
greatly
to
the
credit
of
bentham
that
he
was
amongst
the
first
to
recognise
its
importance
and
to
commend
it
to
the
consideration
of
the
legislator
that
the
lower
animals
as
sentient
beings
have
a
claim
on
our
sympathies
and
that
consequently
we
have
duties
in
respect
of
them
i
can
no
more
doubt
than
that
we
have
duties
in
respect
to
the
inferior
members
of
our
own
race
but
at
the
same
time
considering
their
place
in
the
economy
of
nature
i
can
not
doubt
that
man
has
a
right
within
certain
limits
to
use
them
and
even
to
kill
them
for
his
own
advantage
what
these
limits
are
is
a
question
by
no
means
devoid
of
difficulty
there
are
those
who
maintain
that
we
have
no
right
to
kill
animals
for
food
while
there
are
those
who
without
maintaining
this
extreme
position
hold
that
we
have
no
right
to
cause
them
pain
for
the
purposes
of
our
own
amusement
or
even
for
the
alleviation
of
human
suffering
by
means
of
the
advancement
of
physiological
and
medical
science
it
will
be
seen
that
the
three
questions
here
raised
are
the
legitimacy
of
the
use
of
animal
food
of
field
sports
and
of
vivisection
as
respects
the
first
i
do
not
doubt
that
considering
their
relative
places
in
the
scale
of
being
man
is
morally
justified
in
sacrificing
the
lives
of
the
lower
animals
to
the
maintenance
of
his
own
health
and
vigour
let
alone
the
probability
that
if
he
did
not
they
would
multiply
to
such
an
extent
as
to
endanger
his
existence
and
would
themselves
in
the
aggregate
experience
more
suffering
from
the
privation
caused
by
the
struggle
for
life
than
they
now
do
by
incurring
violent
deaths
at
the
same
time
though
man
may
kill
the
lower
animals
for
his
own
convenience
he
is
bound
not
to
inflict
needless
suffering
on
them
the
torture
of
an
animal
for
no
adequate
purpose
is
absolutely
indefensible
and
the
like
seem
to
me
to
admit
of
no
more
justification
than
the
gladiatorial
shows
are
then
in
the
same
category
the
answer
i
think
depends
on
three
considerations
would
the
animal
be
killed
any
way
either
for
food
or
as
a
beast
of
prey
what
is
the
amount
of
suffering
inflicted
on
it
in
addition
to
that
which
would
be
inflicted
by
killing
it
instantaneously
for
what
purpose
is
this
additional
suffering
inflicted
i
shall
not
attempt
to
apply
these
considerations
in
detail
but
i
shall
simply
state
as
my
opinion
that
amongst
the
results
of
a
legitimate
application
of
them
would
be
the
conclusions
that
worrying
a
dog
or
a
cat
is
altogether
unjustifiable
that
might
be
justified
on
the
ground
that
the
additional
suffering
caused
to
the
fox
is
far
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
beneficial
effects
in
health
and
enjoyment
to
the
hunter
that
shooting
if
the
sportsman
be
skilful
is
one
of
the
most
painless
ways
of
putting
a
bird
or
a
stag
to
death
and
therefore
requires
no
justification
whereas
if
the
sportsman
be
unskilful
the
sufferings
which
he
is
liable
to
cause
through
a
lingering
and
painful
death
ought
to
deter
him
from
practising
his
art
with
regard
to
the
question
of
vivisection
it
seems
to
me
utterly
untenable
and
eminently
inconsistent
on
the
part
of
those
who
eat
animal
food
or
indulge
in
to
maintain
that
under
no
circumstances
is
it
morally
justifiable
to
inflict
pain
on
the
lower
animals
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
causes
or
remedies
of
disease
but
having
once
made
this
admission
i
should
insist
on
the
necessity
of
guarding
it
by
confining
the
power
of
operating
on
the
living
animal
to
persons
duly
authorised
and
by
limiting
it
to
cases
of
research
as
distinct
from
demonstration
those
moreover
who
are
invested
with
this
serious
responsibility
ought
to
feel
morally
bound
to
inflict
no
superfluous
suffering
and
ought
consequently
to
employ
anaesthetics
wherever
they
would
not
unduly
interfere
with
the
conduct
of
the
experiment
to
resort
as
far
as
possible
to
the
lower
rather
than
the
higher
organisms
as
being
less
susceptible
of
pain
and
to
limit
their
experiments
both
in
number
and
duration
as
far
as
is
consistent
with
the
objects
for
which
they
are
permitted
to
perform
them
this
whole
question
however
of
our
relation
to
the
lower
animals
is
one
which
is
fraught
with
much
difficulty
and
supplies
a
good
instance
of
the
range
of
subjects
within
which
the
moral
sentiment
is
probably
in
the
course
of
development
recent
researches
and
still
more
recent
speculations
have
tended
to
impress
us
with
the
nearness
of
our
kinship
to
other
animals
and
hence
our
sympathies
with
them
and
our
interest
in
their
welfare
have
been
sensibly
quickened
the
word
philanthropy
no
longer
expresses
the
most
general
of
the
sympathetic
feelings
and
we
seem
to
require
some
new
term
which
shall
denote
our
with
the
whole
sentient
creation
such
is
a
sample
and
i
must
repeat
that
it
is
intended
only
as
a
sample
of
the
class
of
questions
to
which
as
it
seems
to
me
the
moral
test
still
admits
of
further
application
morality
or
the
science
and
art
of
conduct
had
its
small
beginnings
i
conceive
in
the
primeval
household
and
has
only
attained
its
present
grand
proportions
by
gradual
increments
derived
partly
from
the
operations
of
the
human
intelligence
adapting
itself
to
the
circumstances
in
which
it
is
placed
partly
from
the
conscious
meditations
of
reflective
men
that
it
is
likely
to
advance
in
the
future
as
it
has
done
in
the
past
notwithstanding
the
many
hindrances
to
its
progress
which
confessedly
exist
is
i
think
an
obvious
inference
from
experience
we
may
not
unreasonably
hope
that
there
will
be
a
stricter
sense
of
justice
a
more
complete
realisation
of
duty
more
delicacy
of
feeling
a
greater
refinement
of
manners
more
kindliness
quicker
and
wider
sympathies
in
the
coming
generations
than
there
are
amongst
ourselves
i
have
attempted
in
this
essay
briefly
to
delineate
the
nature
of
the
feelings
on
which
this
progress
depends
and
of
the
considerations
by
which
it
is
guided
as
well
as
to
indicate
some
few
out
of
the
many
directions
which
it
is
likely
to
take
in
the
future
in
the
former
part
of
my
task
i
am
aware
that
i
have
run
counter
to
many
prejudices
of
long
standing
and
that
the
theories
which
i
consider
to
be
alone
consistent
with
the
fact
of
the
progress
of
morality
may
by
some
be
thought
to
impair
its
authority
but
if
morality
has
its
foundations
in
the
constitution
of
human
nature
which
itself
proceeds
from
the
divine
source
of
all
things
i
conceive
that
its
credentials
are
sufficiently
assured
in
the
present
chapter
i
have
in
attempting
to
illustrate
the
possibility
of
future
improvements
in
the
art
and
theory
of
conduct
been
necessarily
led
to
note
some
deficiencies
in
the
existing
moral
sentiment
this
is
always
an
unwelcome
and
invidious
task
men
do
not
like
to
be
reminded
of
their
moral
failings
and
there
is
hardly
any
man
however
critical
he
may
be
of
others
who
in
the
actual
conduct
of
life
does
not
appear
to
delude
himself
with
the
idea
that
his
own
moral
practice
is
perfect
i
appeal
however
from
the
unconscious
assumptions
of
men
to
their
powers
of
reflexion
and
i
ask
each
man
who
reads
this
book
to
consider
carefully
within
himself
whether
on
the
principles
here
set
out
much
of
the
conduct
and
many
of
the
ethical
maxims
which
are
now
generally
accepted
do
not
admit
of
refinement
and
improvement
in
the
sphere
of
morals
as
in
all
other
departments
of
human
activity
we
are
bound
to
do
for
our
successors
what
our
predecessors
were
bound
to
do
and
mostly
did
for
us
transmit
the
heritage
we
have
received
with
all
the
additions
and
adaptations
which
the
new
experiences
and
changing
conditions
of
life
have
rendered
necessary
or
desirable
