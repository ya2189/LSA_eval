by

your
fellow

i
have
been
so
fortunate
as
to
reach
these
happy
shores
providence
has
granted
me
to
behold
that
fair
country
and
that
nation
which
every
lover
of
freedom
desires
to
see
with
his
own
eyes
and
every
freeman
of

is
wont
to
think
of
with
love
and
esteem
your
land
long
since
the
asylum
of
the
persecuted
has
welcomed
me
with
hearty
benevolence
from
the
first
moment
of
my
arrival
to
the
present
time
i
have
received
daily
proofs
of
your
sympathy
full
of
gratitude
and
in
the
hope
of
doing
you
an
acceptable
service
i
can
not
better
employ
the
moments
allowed
me
during
my
stay
among
you
than
by
giving
you
a
faithful
account
of
our
revolution
and
of
its
true
causes
and
motives
as
well
as
of
the
events
of
the
war
by
which
it
was
followed
by
a
brief
statement
of
the
circumstances
which
brought
about
that
revolution
i
wish
to
inform
you
of
the
injustice
and
outrages
which
my
nation
was
compelled
to
endure
during
fourteen
years
in
which
both
its
natural
rights
and
the
constitution
solemnly
guarantied
to
it
were
trampled
under
foot
by
a
true
account
of
the
events
of
the
ensuing
war
you
will
be
enabled
to
convince
yourselves
of
the
means
by
which
small
forces
became
victorious
over
a
colossal
power
as
well
as
of
the
causes
of
the
final
catastrophe
to
which
poland
has
been
doomed
i
am
convinced
that
in
many
respects
my
narrative
will
be
entirely
opposed
to
the
representations
given
in
the
public
papers
for
our
land
like
most
countries
struggling
for
liberty
was
surrounded
by
enemies
rather
than
friends
the
sources
from
which
these
accounts
have
been
drawn
are
first
my
own
recollections
of
events
of
which
i
was
an
secondly
the
reports
of
my
friends
and
comrades
who
were
present
and
lastly
particularly
as
to
the
operations
of
the
detached
corps
the
official
reports
of
the
army
which
have
not
yet
escaped
my
memory
the
same
course
i
have
followed
in
the
design
of
the
plans
which
have
been
traced
partly
from
my
own
recollections
of
positions
and
scenes
at
which
i
was
present
partly
from
the
accurate
reports
of
friends
and
partly
from
public
reports
assisted
by
my
personal
knowledge
of
localities
americans
i
am
neither
an
author
nor
a
scholar
by
profession
but
a
simple
republican
and
soldier
in
such
a
one
you
will
forgive
faults
in
the
form
and
style
of
writing
do
not
then
judge
me
as
a
writer
but
see
in
me
an
unhappy
pole
who
presents
to
your
sympathies
the
picture
of
the
fatal
disasters
of
his
unfortunate
country
and
of
the
manner
in
which
it
strove
to
regain
its
liberty
that
first
and
greatest
of
national
blessings
in
this
hope
of
your
indulgence
i
beg
you
to
accept
this
work
as
a
token
of
my
gratitude
and
as
a
memorial
of
my
short
stay
among
you
as
well
as
an
expression
of
the
great
esteem
with
which
i
shall
always
remain
americans
your
devoted
servant
joseph

to
the
gentlemen
who
have
aided
me
by
the
translation
the
execution
of
the
plates
and
the
publication
of
the
work
i
offer
the
only
recompense
which
they
will
permit
me
to
make
my
heartfelt
thanks
and
i
assure
them
that
in
the
feelings
which
prompt
this
acknowledgment
all
my
comrades
will
participate
the
there
are
difficulties
in
the
way
of
accurate
rules
for
the
pronunciation
of
polish
words
arising
from
the
circumstance
that
some
letters
have
varieties
of
sound
which
are
indicated
by
signs
in
the
polish
alphabet
and
which
can
not
be
represented
in
the
english
thus
the
letter
has
in
addition
to
that
of
the
english
the
sounds
of
and
the
first
indicated
by
a
short
line
and
the
second
by
a
dot
placed
over
the
letter
it
has
therefore
been
thought
more
for
the
convenience
of
readers
who
may
wish
to
know
the
english
pronunciation
of
the
names
which
occur
in
this
work
to
subjoin
an
alphabetical
list
of
them
and
their

such
a
reply
from
napoleon
the

could
never
have
expected
for
who
accompanied
him
so
faithfully
in

his
expeditions

the

and

who
had
fought
for
the
integrity
of
the
french
republic
and
for
the
aggrandizement
of
napoleon
his
cold
reception
of
the
deputies
of
poland
filled
all
patriots
with
sadness
they
were
now
convinced
that
the
good
wishes
of
napoleon
for
poland
were
not
sincere
and
that
through
his
marriage
with
maria
louisa
he
had
come
under
austrian
influence
thus
the
hope
of
territorial
enlargement
and
national
existence
vanished
away
and
napoleon
by
his
indifference
to
the
interests
of
poland
accelerated
his
own
fall
the
burning
of
moscow
which
was
a
chance
that
did
not
enter
into
his
calculations
became
the
turning
point
of
his
fate
the
poles
who
had
contributed
to
his
greatness
did
not
desert
him
in
his
distress
they
were
his
companions
to
the
very
last
half
a

disasters
of

decided
the
fate
of

by
the
congress
of
vienna
the
of
warsaw
was
made
into
a
kingdom
and
subjected
to
the
iron
sceptre
of
russia
at
the
first
moment
of
entering
upon
the
government
of
the
kingdom
the
emperor
alexander
seemed
disposed
to
load
poland
with
benefits
on
his
return
from
paris
he
was
received
by
the
inhabitants
of
warsaw
with
the
most
unfeigned
good
will
and
his
stay
in
that
city
was
marked
by
acts
of
beneficence
the
words
with
which
he
then
addressed
the
representatives
of
the
nation
are
still
in
the
memory
of
every
i
respect
and
love
your
nation
to
these
feelings
on
my
part
in
which
all
europe
partakes
you
are
entitled
by
your
continual
and
disinterested
sacrifices
for
the
prosperity
of
other
nations
i
swear
to
maintain
your
constitution
with
all
the
privileges
guarantied
by
it
and
this
same
constitution
i
promise
to
grant
to
your
brethren
in
the
provinces
which
are
to
be
united
with
you
in
one
kingdom
the
nation
believed
in
these
promises
the
more
readily
as
the
affectionate
deportment
of
the
monarch
seemed
to
confirm
them
during
his
stay
in
warsaw
he
paid
visits
to
several
of
the
most
popular
and
patriotic
families
and
individuals
and
every
where
expressed
himself
in
terms
of
the
highest
esteem
for
the
polish
nation
this
show
of
benevolence
and
the
dreams
of
happiness
with
which
it
inspired
the
people
were
not
however
of
long
duration
before
his
departure
from
warsaw
the
emperor
named
as
viceroy
of
poland
the
old
general
zajaczek
raising
him
to
the
dignity
of
a
prince
and
his
own
brother
the
grand
duke
constantine
as
commander
in
chief
of
the
polish
army
the
appointment
of
these
persons
to
the
supreme
power
was
already
in
direct
opposition
to
all
the
promises
he
had
made
for
zajaczek
through
the
infirmities
of
his
advanced
age
was
unfit
for
the
post
of
viceroy
and
could
be
but
an
instrument
in
russian
hands
while
in
constantine
the
commander
in
chief
of
their
army
the
poles
received
a
tyrant
not
long
after
the
departure
of
alexander
the
encroachments
of
the
russian
cabinet
began
to
be
felt
removals
of
officers
took
place
in
all
the
branches
of
government
in
particular
of
those
known
as
patriots
who
were
supplanted
by
minions
of
russia
men
full
of
ambition
and
intrigue
in
the
first
year
of
the
russian
government
the
bureau
of
police
was
enlarged
and
filled
with
persons
whom
the
nation
despised
the
polish
army
which
had
gathered
laurels
in
so
many
countries
of
the
three
continents
and
which
was
held
in
such
high
estimation
by
the
first
monarch
and
general
in
europe
was
exposed
on
the
very
first
days
of
the
new
government
to
the
insults
of
constantine
there
was
not
an
officer
but
was
grossly
offended
by
the
grand
duke
and
more
than
all
those
who
wore
military
decorations
for
their
merits
no
past
services
were
valued
they
only
exposed
those
who
were
distinguished
by
them
to
greater
persecution
in
the
first
six
months
many
officers
among
whom
was
the
renowned
general
sokolnicki
committed
suicide
and
nearly
one
half
the
officers
and
generals
asked
their
dismission
among
whom
was
general
the
late
dictator
chlopicki
who
preferred
poverty
and
want
to
such
an
ignominious
service
the
polish
army
those
soldiers
animated
by
feelings
of
honor
and
the
love
of
distinction
were
to
be
transformed
into
the
machines
of
despotism
they
who
had
faced
death
in
so
many
battles
who
were
covered
with
wounds
and
who
had
been
called
by
the
greatest
leader
of
his
age
were
now
to
be
beaten
with
the
russian
knout
in
the
first
year
few
days
passed
in
which
some
of
the
soldiers
did
not
commit
suicide
this
prince
who
appeared
not
to
find
victims
enough
for
his
cruelty
in
the
army
began
to
meddle
with
all
the
branches
of
administration
and
to
control
them
soon
the
liberty
of
the
press
was
prohibited
freemasonry
was
interdicted
and
a
bureau
of
spies
was
established
the
chief
in
this
bureau
of
spies
were
rozniecki
the
of
the
city
of
warsaw
lubowidzki
a
man
of
the
name
of
macrot
and
schlee
from
the
documents
found
upon
schlee
and
macrot
it
was
ascertained
that
there
were
in
warsaw
alone
spies
in
the
provinces
their
number
amounted
to
the
expenses
and
salaries
of
these
spies
according
to
accounts
found
among
their
papers
drew
from
the
public
treasury
or
polish
gilders
thus
our
poor
country
instead
of
employing
her
resources
for
the
happiness
of
her
children
was
forced
to
pay
the
mercenaries
hired
to
distress
them
soon
warsaw
and
the
whole
kingdom
became
one
vast
prison
these
spies
endeavoured
to
steal
into
every
company
and
were
present
in
all
public
places
they
tried
to
catch
every
conversation
and
distorted
every
word
spoken
with
however
innocent
an
intention
in
regard
to
the
policy
and
administration
of
the
country
in
order
to
extort
money
they
accused
some
of
the
most
respected
and
honest
persons
who
were
thrown
into
prison
and
many
of
whom
were
never
again
seen
by
their
families
from
the
midst
of
whom
they
had
been
dragged
in
the
in
order
to
conceal
the
crime
from
the
eyes
of
the
world
persons
who
did
not
take
off
their
hats
in
the
streets
before
the
grand
duke
were
compelled
to
draw
barrows
of
mud
upon
the
public
places
there
passed
hardly
a
month
in
which
some
students
were
not
arrested
and
without
any
trial
at
the
mere
denunciation
of
a
hireling
spy
thrown
into
prison
where
they
lingered
for
years
thus
faded
away
in
dungeons
many
fair
and
hopeful
youths
the
flower
of
our
nation
in
warsaw
besides
the
public
gaols
there
were
beneath
almost
all
of
the
barracks
prisons
where
the
victims
of
tyranny
were
tortured
the
very
orangery
of
the
grand
duke
was
transformed
into
a
prison
from
which
some
persons
were
liberated
during
the
revolution
who
had
been
confined
there
for
years
it
was
in
this
prison
that
lukasinski
had
been
kept
for
a
long
time
though
subsequently
bound
to
a
cannon
and
carried
into
russia
in
the
gaols
below
the
barracks
of
the
artillery
many
dead
bodies
were
found
at
the
first
meeting
of
the
diet
when
the
grand
duke
constantine
was
among
the
deputies
from
the
city
of
praga
and
debates
commenced
on
various
subjects
which
concerned
the
welfare
of
the
country
such
as
the
liberty
of
the
press
the
abolition
of
the
central
police
and
the
spies
and
the
deposition
of
several
of
the
higher
officers
for
which
petitions
had
been
sent
to
the
monarch
a
decision
was
promulgated
that
the
diet
should
act
in
subordination
to
the
will
of
the
grand
duke
and
in
order
to
add
force
to
this
decision
the
palace
and
its
galleries
were
surrounded
and
filled
by
guards
all
public
debates
during
the
session
were
prohibited
and
a
ticket
from
the
police
was
required
for
admission
these
tickets
were
distributed
among
russian
generals
officers
of
government
and
their
families
and
creatures
of
the
court
before
such
an
auditory
discussions
of
the
most
sacred
interest
to
the
nation
were
to
take
place
no
patriot
could
behold
without
tears
the
senators
and
fathers
of
the
nations
descendants
of
tarnowski
zamoiski
chodkiewicz
and
kosciusko
sitting
with
sad
and
drooping
countenances
exposed
to
the
scoffing
and
laughter
of
those
minions
of
the
court
the
sacred
halls
were
transformed
into
a
theatre
for
russian
spectators
in
all
the
different
bureaus
spies
held
important
offices
and
thus
those
bureaus
became
scenes
of
the
most
detestable
intrigues
law
and
right
were
trampled
under
foot
and
the
constitution
itself
was
derided
they
used
to
express
themselves
in
the
following
and
similar
terms
is
the
constitution
it
is
an
impediment
to
the
administration
of
the
government
and
the
course
of
justice
the
grand
duke
is
the
best
constitution
a
few
years
had
passed
away
in
this
wretched
state
of
the
nation
when
towards
our
noble
patriots
krzyzanowski
jablonowski
plichta
debek
and
soltyk
conceived
the
idea
of
emancipating
their
country
by
a
revolution
whilst
occupied
with
their
noble
scheme
they
were
most
agreeably
surprised
by
receiving
information
in
of
a
similar
patriotic
union
in
russia
for
throwing
off
the
yoke
of
despotism
their
joy
was
increased
when
they
received
a
summons
from
this
patriotic
union
in
russia
at
the
head
of
which
were
pestel
releiew
bestuzew
kichelbeker
murawiew
and
kachowski
to
join
hands
with
them
this
junction
was
effected
in
kiow
on
the
day
of
the
great
fair
when
prince
jablonowski
became
acquainted
with
some
of
their
members
and
was
initiated
into
their
plans
the
invitation
was
received
by
the
poles
with
delight
accustomed
to
combat
for
liberty
they
offered
with
their
whole
hearts
their
aid
in
the
redemption
of
the
sarmatic
nation
from
the
chains
by
which
they
had
been
so
long
bound
down
soon
after
this
it
was
agreed
to
meet
in
the
town
of
orla
in
the
province
of
little
russia
where
solemn
oaths
were
sworn
to
sacrifice
life
and
property
in
the
cause
resolutions
were
taken
and
the
means
of
their
execution
were
devised
the
russians
promised
to
the
poles
in
case
of
success
the
surrender
of
all
the
provinces
as
far
as
the
frontiers
which
had
established
this
promise
as
well
as
that
of
eternal
friendship
between
the
two
was
sanctioned
by
the
solemnity
of
oaths
the
day
fixed
upon
for
the
breaking
out
of
the
revolution
was
the
anniversary
of
the
accession
of
alexander
in
the
month
of
may
and
in
volhynia
was
the
place
selected
for
the
first
blow
the
reason
for
choosing
this
place
was
that
the
whole
imperial
family
and
the
greater
part
of
the
army
were
to
assemble
there
on
the
great
plain
of
the
dneiper
to
celebrate
the
anniversary
of
the
coronation
this
occasion
was
to
be
improved
to
gain
over
all
the
generals
and
at
the
same
time
to
secure
the
imperial
family
in
the
meeting
at
orla
it
was
required
of
the
poles
that
at
the
moment
of
the
breaking
out
of
the
revolution
they
should
take
the
life
of
the
grand
duke
constantine
to
this
proposition
however
prince
jablonowski
answered
in
these
well
known
words
brother
sarmatians
you
have
summoned
us
to
in
the
holy
work
of
breaking
the
bonds
of
slavery
under
which
our
sarmatic
race
has
so
long
pined
we
come
to
you
with
sincere
hearts
willing
to
sacrifice
our
fortunes
and
lives
rely
my
dear
friends
on
this
our
promise
the
many
struggles
in
which
we
have
already
fought
for
the
sake
of
liberty
may
warrant
our
assertions
brethren
you
demand
of
us
to
murder
the
grand
duke
this
we
can
never
do
the
poles
have
never
stained
their
hands
with
the
blood
of
their
princes
we
promise
you
to
secure
his
person
in
the
moment
of
the
revolution
and
as
he
belongs
to
you
we
shall
deliver
him
into
your
hands
the
patriotic
associations
on
both
sides
endeavored
to
increase
their
party
by
the
initiation
of
many
brave
men
in
the
army
and
in
civil
life
in
lithuania
the
respectable
president
of
the
nobles
downarowicz
and
the
noble
rukiewicz
of
the
lithuanian
corps
with
many
other
officers
were
admitted
into
the
conspiracy
and
among
others
jgelstrom
wigielin
hoffman
and
wielkaniec
all
the
plans
for
the
approaching
revolution
were
arranged
with
the
utmost
circumspection
and
every
circumstance
seemed
to
promise
success
when
the
sudden
death
of
the
emperor
alexander
at
taganrog
in
the
early
part
of
december
darkened
our
bright
hopes
the
news
of
his
death
had
at
first
a
stunning
effect
upon
the
patriotic
club
in
petersburgh
nevertheless
they
resolved
to
act
they
hoped
to
profit
by
the
troubles
between
constantine
and
nicholas
about
the
succession
on
the
of
december
of
the
same
year
the
signal
for
revolt
was
given
in
petersburgh
some
regiments
of
the
guard
were
on
the
side
of
the
patriots
and
with
them
assembled
great
numbers
of
the
people
ready
to
fight
for
liberty
yet
all
this
was
done
without
sufficient
energy
and
without
good
leaders
it
was
unfortunate
that
at
the
time
colonel
pestel
acknowledged
by
all
to
be
a
man
of
great
talents
and
energy
happened
to
be
absent
in
moscow
the
people
assembled
in
their
holy
cause
but
being
without
leaders
began
to
fall
into
disorder
and
a
few
discharges
of
cannon
were
sufficient
to
disperse
them
as
the
grand
duke
constantine
on
account
of
his
marriage
with
a
noble
polish
lady
grudzinska
in
was
obliged
to
renounce
the
throne
of
russia
the
imperial
power
was
by
a
written
document
given
to
the
grand
duke
nicholas
as
the
eldest
in
succession
after
him
some
days
after
the
proclamation
of
nicholas
all
the
prisons
of
the
realm
were
prepared
to
receive
their
new
inmates
petersburgh
moscow
wilna
kiow
bialystok
and
warsaw
were
appointed
for
the
places
of
trial
over
the
whole
of
poland
and
russia
the
sword
of
cruel
revenge
was
suspended
in
petersburgh
the
martyrs
of
liberty
pestel
muraview
releiew
bestuzew
kachowski
were
hung
on
the
gallows
and
more
than
two
hundred
persons
of
the
noblest
families
were
sent
to
siberia
in
wilna
kiow
and
moscow
an
immense
number
were
thrown
into
prison
or
transported
to
siberia
in
bialystok
the
russian
general
wiliaminow
was
appointed
an
inquisitor
this
infamous
character
treated
the
wretched
prisoners
with
the
utmost
cruelty
rukiewicz
jgelstrom
and
wigelin
were
exiled
to
siberia
for
life
in
warsaw
the
grand
duke
himself
undertook
the
business
of
establishing
an
inquisition
over
the
unhappy
prisoners
this
court
was
composed
of
persons
in
the
russian
interest
a
circumstance
the
melancholy
consequences
of
which
soon
became
manifest
senator
soltyk
an
old
man
seventy
years
of
age
was
flogged
with
the
knout
krzyzanowski
unable
to
endure
the
tortures
inflicted
upon
him
committed
suicide
general
procurator
wyezechowski
that
unworthy
son
of
poland
sentenced
all
who
were
condemned
to
death
to
be
hung
on
a
gallows
and
their
bodies
to
be
exposed
upon
the
wheel
this
horrid
sentence
however
was
notwithstanding
all
the
grand
influence
mitigated
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
senate
which
still
contained
many
worthy
men
under
the
presidency
of
the
venerable
woyewode
bilinski
the
infamous
wyezechowski
was
unable
to
oppose
this
virtuous
old
man
whose
powerful
eloquence
was
a
mirror
of
his
noble
heart
president
bilinski
fearless
of
the
threats
of
the
russians
whose
briberies
he
was
accustomed
to
treat
with
disdain
guided
by
the
articles
of
the
criminal
code
altered
the
sentence
of
death
to
a
few
years
imprisonment
this
mitigation
of
the
sentence
was
signed
by
all
the
senators
with
one
exception
after
nicholas
had
ascended
the
throne
over
steps
of
blood
he
was
crowned
in
emperor
of
russia
two
years
after
this
in
he
was
again
crowned
in
warsaw
as
king
of
poland
this
monarch
at
first
intended
not
to
go
through
with
the
ceremony
of
the
coronation
in
warsaw
in
order
to
avoid
the
oath
of
the
constitution
yet
from
fear
of
revolutionary
scenes
he
suffered
himself
to
be
persuaded
to
do
it
and
took
the
oath
like
his
predecessor
and
brother
alexander
to
maintain
the
constitution
and
the
privileges
guarantied
by
it
poland
may
have
suffered
under
alexander
yet
he
loved
the
nation
like
a
friend
as
every
one
of
my
countrymen
will
allow
when
he
was
mistaken
in
his
measures
it
was
that
surrounded
by
bad
men
and
enemies
of
our
nation
he
was
prevented
from
knowing
the
truth
he
was
himself
too
much
engrossed
in
pleasures
to
visit
the
hut
of
the
poor
in
order
to
obtain
information
of
his
condition
poland
forgave
him
all
his
faults
in
the
grateful
recollection
that
he
had
restored
her
to
a
separate
existence
and
respected
the
constitution
far
different
in
our
eyes
appeared
the
present
emperor
nicholas
partaking
of
the
errors
of
his
predecessor
he
exhibited
none
of
his
virtues
alexander
with
a
benignant
countenance
permitted
every
one
to
approach
him
freely
and
his
features
were
never
distorted
by
passion
nicholas
on
the
contrary
seemed
to
terrify
by
his
very
look
his
lowering
and
overbearing
eye
was
the
true
mirror
of
asiatic
despotism
every
movement
was
that
of
command
and
his
imperious
air
was
in
true
harmony
with
the
ruling
passion
of
his
mind
such
a
sovereign
acting
through
the
instrumentality
of
a
brother
like
himself
the
grand
duke
constantine
must
needs
bring
distress
upon
our
country
whole
volumes
might
be
filled
with
the
relation
of
the
atrocities
of
this
government
the
daily
increasing
host
of
spies
in
its
employ
among
whom
even
females
were
found
regarded
nothing
as
sacred
and
mocked
at
the
most
holy
institutions
they
lavished
away
millions
of
the
public
funds
everything
was
permitted
to
them
in
short
the
intention
of
this
government
seemed
to
be
to
plunge
our
country
into
the
deepest
distress
in
order
to
force
us
to
the
abandonment
of
every
national
feeling
and
to
make
us
slaves
of
the
russians
yet
in
this
hope
they
were
deceived
the
more
the
nation
was
oppressed
the
more
its
energy
of
character
was
steeled
and
the
more
the
love
of
country
developed
itself
two
worthy
sons
of
poland
wysocki
and
schlegel
mourning
over
the
martyrdom
of
krzyzanowoski
soltyk
dembek
and
plichta
and
meditating
on
the
distresses
of
their
country
resolved
to
attempt
its
deliverance
by
these
two
young
champions
of
poland
the
first
idea
of
the
revolution
was
conceived
they
communicated
their
hopes
to
several
other
patriots
and
thus
was
formed
the
patriotic
club
this
association
nourishing
in
their
secret
breasts
the
holy
spark
of
liberty
increased
it
soon
to
a
flaming
light
by
which
the
whole
nation
was
led
to
honor
and
glory
these
heroic
men
fearlessly
persevered
in
their
endeavors
during
five
years
exposed
to
the
greatest
dangers
and
amidst
thousands
of
spies
witnesses
of
the
continually
aggravated
oppression
of
their
country
they
became
more
and
more
animated
to
risk
every
thing
for
their
holy
object
while
this
tyrannical
government
was
exulting
in
the
success
of
its
measures
and
the
honor
and
morals
of
our
country
were
fast
declining
the
revolution
of
france
occurred
and
it
instantly
roused
every
mind
to
a
comparison
of
our
state
with
that
of
the
french
who
had
thrown
off
the
yoke
of
a
machiavelian
dynasty
the
three
days
of
july
were
days
of
joy
not
only
to
every
brave
son
of
france
but
to
every
patriotic
heart
in
poland
how
much
were
they
enraptured
who
hitherto
in
secret
had
been
labouring
for
the
redemption
of
their
country
the
happy
result
of
those
glorious
days
was
a
peal
of
terror
to
the
grand
duke
constantine
and
to
the
whole
swarm
of
agents
in
his
tyrannical
sway
it
gave
them
a
presage
of
their
approaching
retribution
yet
instead
of
adopting
milder
measures
and
endeavouring
to
propitiate
the
nation
their
cruelties
went
on
as
before
the
government
had
indeed
advanced
too
far
in
its
barbarous
system
to
draw
back
the
activity
of
the
spies
was
redoubled
from
the
first
reception
of
the
news
of
the
french
revolution
there
did
not
pass
a
day
on
which
some
persons
were
not
imprisoned
in
warsaw
or
the
provinces
on
the
night
of
the
of
september
forty
students
were
seized
in
their
beds
and
carried
to
prison
again
the
new
revolutionary
eruption
of
belgium
cheered
and
encouraged
the
heart
of
every
patriotic
pole
the
hour
for
throwing
off
the
yoke
of
tyranny
was
fast
approaching
the
leaders
of
the
revolution
succeeded
in
communicating
their
sentiments
to
continually
increasing
numbers
many
officers
of
the
regiment
of
the
line
and
of
the
sappers
were
initiated
yet
at
this
very
time
when
the
revolution
was
every
moment
expected
to
break
out
the
russian
despot
in
concert
with
prussia
and
austria
commenced
his
preparations
for
a
war
against
france
and
belgium
the
polish
army
was
destined
to
serve
as
the
vanguard
of
this
expedition
and
modlin
and
warsaw
were
stored
with
large
quantities
of
arms
and
ammunition
from
russia
all
the
regiments
were
completed
and
the
order
for
marching
was
momentarily
expected
these
circumstances
attracted
the
notice
of
our
patriots
and
they
decided
to
accelerate
the
revolution
in
order
to
anticipate
the
march
of
the
army
the
eruption
was
hastened
by
the
following
event
the
citizens
of
warsaw
were
obliged
to
furnish
quarters
for
the
officers
of
the
army
to
lighten
this
burden
and
to
avoid
various
inconveniences
as
well
as
to
accommodate
the
officers
by
an
understanding
with
the
inhabitants
it
was
determined
that
instead
of
furnishing
quarters
a
quartering
tax
should
be
paid
it
was
intended
in
this
regulation
to
proportion
the
tax
to
the
size
of
the
houses
and
consequently
to
the
profit
which
the
proprietors
would
derive
from
letting
them
the
tax
would
in
this
way
be
equalized
because
wherever
levied
it
would
be
attended
by
a
proportionate
compensation
and
it
was
satisfactory
to
the
inhabitants
this
regulation
however
was
executed
in
an
entirely
different
manner
in
many
cases
the
heavier
taxes
were
paid
by
the
poorer
inhabitants
and
indeed
they
had
sometimes
to
provide
quarters
in
addition
to
the
payment
of
the
tax
all
the
persons
employed
by
the
police
as
spies
and
who
had
by
vile
means
acquired
immense
fortunes
and
kept
the
finest
houses
in
warsaw
were
exempt
both
from
the
tax
and
the
providing
of
quarters
the
money
collected
for
the
tax
was
purloined
by
the
commissioners
for
quartering
who
thus
amassed
millions
of
gilders
a
short
time
before
the
revolution
the
gross
impositions
of
this
commission
were
discovered
the
inhabitants
of
warsaw
began
to
murmur
against
it
and
addressed
the
government
for
the
removal
of
the
persons
employed
and
the
substitution
of
others
in
their
places
who
should
be
deserving
of
the
confidence
of
the
citizens
among
others
the
deposition
of
the
president
of
the
city
woyda
was
demanded
and
when
the
government
refused
to
comply
with
the
request
he
was
publicly
insulted
and
flogged
in
the
streets
the
discontent
of
the
citizens
in
particular
of
the
poorer
classes
continued
to
increase
and
of
this
discontent
the
patriots
made
use
in
endeavouring
to
propagate
their
views
of
the
necessity
of
a
revolution
public
opinion
was
from
day
to
day
expressed
more
boldly
papers
were
pasted
up
in
the
streets
with
inscriptions
such
as
these
dwelling
of
the
grand
duke
will
be
let
from
next
new
year
day
with
the
tyrants
away
with
the
barbarians
to
asia
a
great
concourse
of
citizens
assembled
one
evening
before
the
city
hall
and
demanded
the
punishment
of
the
quartering
commissioner
czarnecki
who
in
his
desperation
committed
suicide
the
holy
moment
was
now
fast
approaching
and
warsaw
was
in
anxious
expectation
fear
and
terror
was
painted
in
the
faces
of
the
spies
while
on
the
other
hand
all
true
patriots
were
in
raptures
of
joy
and
waited
impatiently
for
the
moment
to
strike
the
blow
for
several
nights
the
whole
garrison
of
the
city
had
been
under
arms
by
the
orders
of
the
grand
duke
who
tortured
with
the
consciousness
of
so
many
crimes
had
no
rest
and
surrounded
himself
with
large
bodies
of
guards
a
hundred
gens
were
on
horseback
for
many
nights
constantly
bringing
in
their
victims
strong
patroles
of
russian
soldiers
traversed
the
streets
all
was
in
vain
his
mercenaries
could
not
protect
the
tyrant
the
word
was
given
the
oath
was
sworn
to
fight
for
our
sacred
rights
and
the
freedom
of
our
country
an
event
which
served
to
irritate
all
minds
and
hasten
the
revolution
was
the
arrest
and
imprisonment
of
eighty
students
these
brave
young
men
were
assembled
in
a
private
house
in
order
to
pray
to
god
in
secret
for
the
souls
of
their
murdered
ancestors
on
the
anniversary
of
the
storming
of
praga
by
the
bloody
suwarrow
in
when
none
were
spared
and
praga
swam
with
blood
and
was
strewed
with
the
corpses
of
of
its
inhabitants
neither
old
men
women
children
nor
pregnant
mothers
were
spared
by
the
barbarous
russian
soldiers
in
memory
of
this
event
the
patriots
had
every
year
met
for
secret
prayer
since
public
devotions
on
the
occasion
had
been
forbidden
by
the
grand
duke
the
abovementioned
students
with
some
priests
were
in
the
act
of
worship
praying
to
the
almighty
and
honoring
the
memory
of
their
forefathers
when
the
doors
were
broken
open
with
great
violence
and
a
number
of
gens
under
their
captain
jurgaszko
with
a
company
of
russian
soldiers
behind
them
entered
the
apartment
our
brave
youths
continued
their
prayers
upon

yet
in
order
to
make
the
reader
acquainted
with
some
of
them
i
shall
here
state
a
few
in
our
country
the
distilling
and
brewing
of
spirituous
liquors
and
the
planting
of
tobacco
as
well
as
the
sale
of
these
articles
was
a
privilege
of
the
landed
proprietors
warsaw
as
the
capital
and
the
most
populous
city
was
the
best
market
for
these
productions
and
all
the
noblemen
endeavoured
to
bring
their
produce
to
warsaw
for
sale
in
this
manner
they
supplied
themselves
with
money
and
enhanced
the
value
of
their
grain
while
their
liquors
as
well
as
tobacco
could
be
sold
at
very
low
prices
to
the
pecuniary
benefit
of
all
the
laboring
classes
and
the
soldiery
these
advantages
however
soon
became
an
object
of
attention
to
the
government
agents
one
of
their
number
the
jew
nowachowiez
who
by
the
greatest
impositions
had
acquired
an
immense
fortune
devised
a
plan
for
monopolizing
the
production
and
sale
of
every
kind
of
liquor
and
of
tobacco
he
obtained
the
exclusive
right
of
selling
them
and
all
the
noblemen
were
forbidden
to
dispose
of
these
articles
without
his
permission
for
which
a
duty
was
to
be
paid
for
this
monopoly
he
paid
to
the
government
of
polish
gilders
for
which
he
more
than
doubly
indemnified
himself
by
the
enormous
taxes
levied
upon
the
consumers
of
these
articles
this
innovation
so
oppressive
to
the
poorer
classes
and
invented
merely
to
enrich
this
jew
and
his
partners
irritated
all
the
land
proprietors
and
still
more
the
laboring
classes
who
were
suffering
by
it
for
two
years
in
succession
petitions
were
made
for
the
reformation
of
these
abuses
but
the
government
only
insisted
upon
the
prohibition
with
the
greater
severity
nowachowiez
indeed
employed
a
guard
who
wore
uniforms
all
the
environs
of
warsaw
were
filled
with
these
guards
and
the
greatest
excesses
were
committed
by
them
a
poor
after
having
purchased
at
some
distance
from
the
city
some
brandy
and
tobacco
carried
these
articles
at
evening
to
warsaw
on
his
way
he
was
stopped
by
these
men
they
took
all
from
him
and
demanded
a
heavier
fine
than
the
articles
were
worth
as
the
poor
man
was
unable
to
pay
the
fine
they
abused
him
and
were
about
to
carry
him
to
prison
he
succeeded
however
in
making
his
escape
and
as
it
was
in
the
vicinity
of
the
residence
of
a
nobleman
by
the
name
of
biernacki
he
sought
shelter
on
his
estate
the
guards
in
pursuit
entered
the
mansion
of
this
nobleman
biernacki
heard
the
tumult
of
the
guard
seizing
and
roughly
handling
the
poor
man
and
ascertaining
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
he
censured
them
for
their
inhumanity
about
such
a
trifle
in
order
however
to
save
the
man
from
farther
insults
he
retained
him
with
the
intention
of
sending
him
the
next
day
with
a
note
to
nowachowiez
for
his
exculpation
the
very
moment
that
biernacki
was
occupied
in
writing
the
letter
an
officer
of
the
gens
with
four
privates
stepped
in
biernacki
inquired
the
cause
of
this
visit
and
was
told
in
answer
that
he
was
arrested
for
having
protected
a
defrauder
thus
surrounded
by
four
soldiers
this
man
was
publicly
carried
through

with

a

it
is

took
possession

took
the
wheat
from
the
barns
to
feed
their
horses

butchered
the
cattle

the
most
shameful
depredations
and
excesses
were
committed
by
officers

soldiers

of
the
situation
of
the

of
this
nobleman

was
confined
in

and
who
for
a
whole
year
was
in
danger
of
her

from
the
consequences

barbarous
order
of

to

in

found
out

smuggle
these

forced

there
may

mingled
with

impulse
that
of
vengeance
for
the
ignominy
to

feelings
were

colossal
power
dreaded

we
were
not
animated
to

struggle
by
any

desire

conquest

by
a
resolution
to
shake
off
a

by
the
wish
to
preserve
our
civilization
and
to
extend
it

near
the
vistula
the
patriots
were
scattered
over
the
city
ready
to
stir
up
the
people
on
the
appearance
of
the
signal
most
of
them
were
young
men
and
students
some
hundred
and
twenty
students
who
were
to
make
the
beginning
were
assembled
in
the
southern
part
of
warsaw
all
was
ready
at
the
stroke
of
seven
as
soon
as
the
flame
of
the
house
was
seen
reflected
on
the
sky
many
brave
students
and
some
officers
rode
through
the
streets
of
that
part
of
the
city
called
the
old
town
shouting
brethren
the
hour
of
vengeance
has
struck
the
time
to
revenge
the
tortures
and
cruelties
of
fifteen
years
is
come
down
with
the
tyrants
to
arms
brethren
to
arms
our
country
forever
the
excitement
spread
through
this
part
of
the
city
with
incredible
rapidity
the
citizens
flocked
together
from
all
quarters
shouting
with
the
tyrants
poland
forever
at
the
same
time
a
hundred
and
twenty
students
left
their
barrack
which
is
called
the
hotel
of
the
cadets
and
is
situated
in
the
royal
gardens
of
lazienki
under
their
gallant
leaders
wysocki
and
schlegel
and
marched
to
the
quarters
of
the
russian
cavalry
cuirasseurs
hulans
and
hussars
it
was
resolved
to
take
immediate
possession
of
all
the
chief
gates
the
issuing
out
of
the
russian
troops
was
thereby
rendered
very
difficult
and
bloody
as
the
barracks
were
surrounded
by
a
wide
and
deep
moat
over
which
there
were
few
bridges
on
their
arrival
the
cadets
found
the
soldiers
in
the
utmost
confusion
some
were
saddling
their
horses
some
were
leading
them
out
and
others
were
occupied
in
securing
the
magazines
in
short
panic
and
disorder
pervaded
officers
and
men
each
sought
his
own
safety
only
our
young
heroes
took
advantage
of
this
confusion
and
after
firing
a
few
rounds
rushed
with
the
through
the
gates
this
charge
sufficed
a
hundred
and
twenty
of
these
young
poles
after
having
killed
forty
or
fifty
men
with
ball
and
bayonet
dispersed
some
eighteen
hundred
russian
cavalry
cuirasseurs
hulans
and
hussars
mingled
together
joined
in
the
cry
of
terror
and
began
to
seek
concealment
in
garrets
stables
cellars
a
great
number
were
drowned
in
attempting
to
cross
the
canal
in
order
to
escape
into
the
adjoining
gardens
as
the
barracks
were
closely
connected
with
wooden
buildings
filled
with
hay
straw
and
other
combustible
articles
not
a
man
would
have
escaped
had
they
been
fired
the
young
poles
refrained
from
this
in
mercy
the
russians
might
all
have
been
made
prisoners
for
so
great
was
their
panic
that
they
were
not
ashamed
to
beg
for
quarter
on
their
knees
but
these
advantages
were
for
the
time
neglected
the
cadets
abandoned
the
attack
and
hastened
into
the
city
where
their
presence
was
more
necessary
while
their
comrades
were
attacking
the
barracks
some
ten
or
twelve
students
traversed
the
gardens
towards
the
palace
of
the
grand
duke
called
the
belvidere
in
order
to
secure
his
person
some
of
them
guarded
the
passages
on
the
side
of
the
gardens
while
others
penetrated
to
the
tyrant
apartment
but
he
had
escaped
through
a
secret
door
on
the
failure
of
the
party
of
cadets
sent
to
secure
the
person
of
the
grand
duke
they
left
his
apartments
without
in
the
least
disturbing
the
repose
of
his
lady
as
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
they
met
lubowicki
the
of
the
city
coming
to
the
grand
duke
for
instructions
as
soon
as
he
saw
them
he
began
to
cry
for
aid
but
the
next
moment
fell
on
his
knees
and
begged
for
his
life
they
took
him
with
them
intending
to
extract
from
him
all
the
information
he
was
able
to
give
in
the
they
met
the
russian
general
gendre
of
the
grand
duke
with
some
ten
or
twelve
armed
men
they
resolutely
attacked
him
gendre
fell
under
their
bayonets
and
his
followers
fled
the
party
meeting
with
no
farther
obstacles
returned
to
their
friends
whom
they
found
at
the
bridge
of
sobieski
the
company
of
cadets
after
having
finished
their
attack
upon
the
barracks
of
the
russian
cavalry
marched
along
the
high
road
which
traverses
the
park
over
the
bridge
of
sobieski
towards
the
main
avenue
between
the
terraces
of
the
hospital
ujasdow
on
one
side
and
those
of
the
botanical
garden
on
the
other
after
having
arrived
at
this
bridge
they
heard
the
noise
of
horses
in
front
as
of
cavalry
advancing
it
was
in
fact
a
company
of
russian
cuirasseurs
who
were
on
guard
in
this
part
of
the
park
and
who
were
now
hastening
to
save
the
barracks
immediately
a
plan
was
formed
to
receive
them
the
cadets
forming
in
a
line
concealed
themselves
in
the
park
near
the
street
the
cuirasseurs
came
up
they
were
permitted
to
advance
and
were
then
received
with
a
brisk
fire
the
heavy
cavalry
who
could
not
turn
in
this
narrow
road
suffered
severely
sixty
bodies
were
found
on
the
spot
the
rest
fled
in
the
greatest
disorder
from
this
bridge
that
handful
of
brave
young
men
passed
the
street
of
wieyska
and
after
arriving
at
the
barracks
of
radziwil
they
met
a
squadron
of
russian
hussars
returning
from
a
patrol
at
the
same
time
they
heard
the
russian
cavalry
in
pursuit
who
had
gained
time
to
mount
at
their
barracks
this
was
a
critical
moment
but
it
was
met
with
resolution
one
half
threw
themselves
into
the
ditch
in
order
to
receive
the
hussars
and
the
others
formed
a
platoon
and
with
hurrahs
and
the
shout
of
forever
discharged
their
pieces
and
attacked
the
cuirasseurs
in
their
rear
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
the
russians
were
thrown
into
disorder
and
fled
with
the
greatest
precipitaion
leaving
many
dead
behind
them
the
cadets
not
having
lost
a
single
man
in
all
these
skirmishes
arrived
at
the
part
of
the
city
called
the
or
the
new
world
and
the
trzy
zlote
krzyze
the
three
golden
crosses
here
they
found
two
companies
of
polish
light
infantry
and
with
them
the
two
polish
generals
stanislaus
potocki
and
trembicki
who
were
giving
commands
for
restoring
order
by
force
and
for
arresting
the
assembled
inhabitants
the
company
of
cadets
arrived
and
hailed
the
light
infantry
with
the
following
words
are
you
here
to
shed
the
blood
of
your
brethren
have
you
forgotten
the
russian
tyranny
come
to
our
embrace
and
hand
to
hand
let
us
attack
the
tyrants
poland
forever
this
address
was
enough
they
disobeyed
the
commands
of
their
unworthy
generals
and
joined
the
cadets
and
the
populace
when
the
two
generals
had
the
madness
to
reproach
the
soldiers
some
of
the
cadets
went
to
them
and
told
them
in
a
few
words
the
state
of
affairs
and
on
their
knees
and
with
tears
intreated
them
not
to
forsake
the
cause
of
their
country
to
stanislaus
potocki
the
command
of
the
army
was
offered
at
the
same
time
they
were
both
warned
of
the
fatal
consequences
of
their
refusal
it
was
of
no
avail
these
infatuated
men
could
not
see
the
justice
of
the
cause
and
began
to
insult
the
students
upon
this
the
cadets
left
them
and
they
fell
victims
to
the
indignation
of
the
populace
in
this
place
some
gens
who
undertook
to
disperse
the
citizens
were
killed
after
the
union
with
the
two
companies
of
light
infantry
it
was
decided
they
should
both
march
to
the
street
of
szulec
on
the
left
bank
of
the
vistula
endeavor
there
to
assemble
the
citizens
and
establish
a
degree
of
order
and
after
that
to
take
possession
of
the
bridge
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
the
necessary
communications
between
praga
and
warsaw
during
the
night
and
to
defend
it
to
the
last
against
any
attack
of
the
enemy
the
cadets
marched
directly
into
the
city
through
the
singing
patriotic
songs
and
shouting
forever
every
where
the
citizens
answered
their
shouts
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
and
joined
the
ranks
of
those
brave
youths
both
old
and
young
men
and
even
women
left
their
dwellings
in
order
to
increase
the
numbers
of
the
liberators
of
their
country
in
their
passage
through
that
street
this
company
made
prisoners
of
many
russian
generals
officers
c
who
were
on
their
flight
after
advancing
as
far
as
the
palace
of
the
viceroy
they
met
the
polish
general
hauke
and
colonel
mieciszewski
these
worthless
men
accompanied
by
some
gens
were
on
their
way
to
the
grand
duke
in
the
belvidere
some
cadets
stepped
in
their
way
and
exhorted
them
to
dismount
and
surrender
themselves
instead
of
answering
general
hauke
drew
a
pistol
and
wounded
one
of
them
which
act
cost
him
and
his
companion
their
lives
in
the
same
manner
general
siemiontkowski
with
some
gens
and
soldiers
endeavored
to
disperse
and
arrest
the
citizens
assembled
in
the
he
likewise
was
a
russian
instrument
and
was
hated
by
the
nation
whilst
this
company
of
cadets
was
engaged
in
the
south
part
of
the
city
the
regiment
a
battalion
of

had
mounted

were
active
in
another
quarter
this
regiment
as
soon
as
the
signals
were
given
revolted
the
battalion
on
guard
beat
the
at
every
and
the
two
other
battalions
formed
for
the
attack
of
the
russian
infantry
in
their
barracks
called
the
barracks
of
sapieha
the
shouts
of
the
soldiers
and
citizens
advancing
to
the
attack
mingled
with
the
noise
of
the
drums
on
every
side
a
great
number
of
russian
general
officers
and
spies
were
taken
in
their
flight
in
the
street
of
the
little
theatre
and
the
street
of
napoleon
as
soon
as
the
numbers
assembled
would
admit
of
it
divisions
were
detached
to
liberate
the
prisoners
especially
those
in
the
franciscan
and
carmelite
prisons
these
prisons
always
guarded
by
russian
troops
were
stormed
the
russian
soldiers
were
driven
in
and
a
massacre
commenced
in
the
corridors
where
a
great
number
of
them
fell
by
the
bayonet
together
with
many
police
officers
and
turnkeys
the
doors
were
broken
down
and
an
indescribable
scene
took
place
when
the
victims
already
sentenced
perhaps
to
death
or
reserved
for
tortures
were
set
at
liberty
with
tears
in
their
eyes
they
fell
into
the
arms
of
their
deliverers
here
a
father
found
a
son
there
a
son
a
father
many
of
the
emaciated
captives
could
only
creep
to
meet
the
embraces
of
their
brethren
but
what
was
most
shocking
was
the
appearance
of
four
ladies
who
had
been
incarcerated
for
having
resisted
the
brutal
advances
of
certain
russian
generals
they
were
reduced
to
mere
skeletons
there
was
not
one
of
the
spectators
who
did
not
shudder
and
weep
at
the
sight
and
swear
to
avenge
them
a
hundred
and
seventy
students
and
from
forty
to
fifty
older
persons
polish
soldiers
and
citizens

innocent
victims
of

the
battalion
of
sappers

to
attack
the
russian
infantry

the
barracks
of

and
stanislaus
on
their
arrival
there
they
found
some
companies
under
arms
and
summoned
them
to
surrender
instead
of
complying
they
began
to
fire
and
our
soldiers
fell
instantly
upon
them
with
the
they
were
dispersed
in
a
moment
and
many
officers
and
soldiers
were
made
prisoners
so
panic
struck
were
many
of
the
officers
of
the
russian
guard
that
they
did
not
hesitate
to
creep
into
the
cellars
whence
they
were
dragged
out
by
the
legs
the
russians
fled
from
the
barracks
and
the
city
in
the
utmost
disorder
and
took
refuge
beyond
the
powonzki
barrier
after
all
these
successes
the
northern
eastern
and
western
parts
of
the
city
were
occupied
at
about

by
divisions
of
patriot

the
western
part
of
the
city
and
by
them
all
the
public
treasures
and
the
bank
were
secured
one
of
these
parties
composed
of
sappers
met
the
russian
colonel
sass
in
his
flight
as
he
did
not
stop
at
their
challenge
he
was
shot
when
the
city
had
been
nearly
freed
of
the
russians
great
multitudes
hastened
to
the
arsenal
for
arms
and
ammunition
here
they
found
the
polish
general
blummer
who
was
rash
enough
to
resist
he
ordered
his
soldiers
to
fire
on
the
people
but
they
refused
to
obey
and
joined
their
brethren
this
general
was
slain

just
punishment
for
his
murderous
intentions
all
the
apartments
were
immediately
opened
and
more
than
muskets

sabres
and
carbines
were
obtained
they
were
distributed
with
admirable
good
order

commanders
and
sent
to

parts
of

seize
his

papers
this
man
had
hid
himself
in
the
cellar
with
some
of
his
satellites
and
fired
upon
the
patrol
the
consequence
was
that
macrot
and
his
people
were
massacred

two
in
the
morning
the
quiet
of
the
city
was
restored
most
of
the
patriots

in
the
ulica

or
long
street
to
consult
on
the
measures
to
be
adopted
on
the
following
day
and
the
manner
in
which
the
nation
should
be
addressed
by
the
patriotic
party
they
called
to
memory
the
cruelties
of
the
russian
government
and
urged
the
necessity
of
a
revolution
to
prevent
the
decay
of
all
moral
and
national
feeling
they
implored
the
people
to
aid
in
this
holy
cause
yet
at
the
same
time
besought
them
never
to
violate
the
dictates
of
humanity
brethren
they
said
no
one
have
a
right
to
accuse
us
of
cruelty
may
the
sanctity
of
our
cause
never
be
polluted
by
barbarious
passions
having
a
single
end
in
view
national
freedom
and
justice
may
we
prove
lions
in
battle
mild
and
indulgent
to
defenceless
foes
and
repentant
apostates

and
friendship
be
ours

us
forget
private
rancor
and
selfish
interest
children
of
one
mother

dear
poland

us
save
her
from

these
addresses
were
received
by
the
people
with
the
most
fervent
enthusiasm
and
with
cries
of
forever
they
swore
to
fight
for
her
while
a
drop
flowed
in
their
hearts
and
never
to
forsake
the
field
of
valor
or
the
path
of
virtue
the
assembled
multitude
then
knelt
down
before
the
almighty
to
thank
him
for
a
deliverance
accomplished
with
so
little
bloodshed
and
to
implore
a
continuation
of
his
mercies
it
was
a
scene
which
no
description
can
equal
in
the
depth
of
the
night
the
immense
crowds
of
people
kneeling
their
figures
illuminated
by
the
glare
of
the
fires
lighted
in
the
streets
praying
to
god
their
deliverer
presented
a
sight
to
have
touched

they
have
witnessed
it
when
prayers
were
over

were
adopted
for
the
defence

of
the
crowds
who
after
expelling
the
russians
moved
through
the
streets
in
perfect
order
shouting
songs
of

arrangement
was
made
public
about
noon
in
order
to
tranquilize
the
people
the
first
step
taken
by
the
new

was
to
send
deputies
to
the
grand
duke
they
were
instructed
to
demand
whether
he
meant
to
depart
peaceably
or
to
attack
the
city
among
the
deputies
were
lubecki
and
lelewell
they
found
the
grand
duke
encamped
with
his
army
in
the
fields
of

the
deputies
represented
to
constantine
the
consequences
that
would
result
from
an
attack
on
the
city
as
well
in
regard
to
himself
as
to
the
nation
they
informed
him
that
the
army
had
already
joined
the
people
and
proposed
to
him
that
he
should
depart
unmolested
on
a
prescribed
route
they
promised
that
he
should
find
every
possible
accommodation
provided
on
that
route
for
himself
and
his
troops
the
grand
duke
demanded
some
time
for
reflection
and
finally
gave
the
deputies
the
following
answer
in
writing
art
i
the
grand
duke
declares
that
it
was
never
his
intention
to
attack
warsaw
in
case
he
should
find
himself
under
the
necessity
of
so
doing
he
will
give
the
authorities
notice
of
his
intention
hours
before
the
attack

the
deputies
returned
to
warsaw
with
this
answer
at
three
it
was
immediately
published
but
did
not
satisfy
the
people
they
demanded
to
know
the
day
and
hour
of
the
grand
duke
departure
if
he
should
refuse
to
obey
they
declared
that
they
would
attack

was
finally
concluded
to
allow
him
two
days
for
his
necessary
arrangements
and
then
to
send
a
second
deputation
to
insist
on
his
instant
departure
the
provisional
government
immediately
set
about
restoring
order
to
every
department
of
the
administration
the
bureau
of
police
was
abolished
and
a
council
of
citizens
was
substituted

was
compelled
to
leave

persecutions

brought
upon
himself

not
being
sufficiently
in

spirit

guard
was
established

placed

performed

punctuality

to
go
about
the
streets
and
earn
money
by
their
labor
in
addition
to
their
usual
allowance
the
russians
were
so
touched
by
this
generous
treatment
that
they
swore
with
tears
never
to
forget
it
these
details
of
the
first
day
of
our
revolution
for
the
correctness
of
which
i
pledge
myself
may
serve
to
answer
the
accusations
of
some
journalists
who
have
stated
that
the
commencement
of
the
national
struggle
was
marked
with
the
greatest
atrocities
and
that
more
than
forty
field
officers
many
subalterns
and
large
parties
of
privates
were
butchered
for
declining
to
engage
in
the
cause
these
impeachments
of
the
polish
nation
are
unjust
and
false
as
has
been
said
before
the
foreigners
in
warsaw
could
not
sufficiently
praise
the
admirable
order
with
which
our
first
movements
were
conducted
our
enemies
accuse
the
people
of
having
robbed
the
public
i
affirm
that
not
a
gilder
was
lost
neither
public
nor
private
property
was
pillaged
as
the
enemy
was
still
encamped
before
the
city
on
the
first
and
second
of
december
and
had
as

given
no
decisive
answer
respecting
the
time
of
his
departure
the

as
well
as
the

were
still
under

and
upon

the
twelve

it

to

their

many
of
them
had
just
been
rescued
from

issued
a
proclamation

promised
never
to
fight
against
those
to
use

always
loved
he
adduced
his
marriage
with
a
young
polish
lady
as
a
proof
of
his
affection
for
the
nation
at
the
same
time
he
promised
to
entreat
the
emperor
to
grant
an
amnesty
and
to
take
in
general
the
mildest
measures
he
begged
the
poles
to
deal
gently
with
the
russian
prisoners
their
families
the
ladies
and
in
short
with
all
russian
subjects
remaining

too
plainly
that
the

befell

was
owing

the

the
of

if

the

gigantic

could
not
have
come
in

the
equilibrium
of

now
entirely
lost

was

a

policy

the
question

the
independence
of

this
was
the
object

kept
in

him
in

was
assured

all
these
promises
were
published

in
yet
in
the
very
act
of
confirmation
several
privileges
which
the
emperor
had
promised
to
czartoriski
were
retracted
and
this
was
owing
to
the
influence
of
the

the

began
its
session
under
the
guidance
of
very
worthy
persons
the
object
of
this
society
was
to
watch
over
all
the
departments
of
the
administration
to
see
that
the
measures
adopted
were
congenial
with
the
wishes
of
the
people
and
in
the
spirit
of
the
revolution
and
to
promote
fraternity
and
union
throughout
the
nation

desired
to
repress
all
manifestations
of
selfishness
or
ambition
to
discover
and
bring
before
the
people
the
persons
best
qualified
for
public
offices
and
in
short
to
promote
the
best
interests
of
the
nation
with
unwearied
zeal
if
this
club
was
at
times
led
by
the
fervor
of
patriotic
feeling
to
adopt
measures
considered
rigorous
by
many
their
acts
were
never
inconsistent
with
the
love
of
country
or
their
own
views
of
the
national
honor
at
this
time
a
committee
was
also
appointed
for
the
trial
of
the
spies
on
the
morning
of
the
third

the
grand

commenced
his
march
towards
pulawa
according
to
agreement
and
the
polish
regiments
which
had
remained
with
constantine
up
to
this
time
now
returned
to
warsaw
these
troops
were
at
first
regarded
by
the
people
with
feelings
of
indignation
such
feelings
were
however
soon
dissipated
by
the
explanations
which
were
given
they
had
been
misled
by
their
generals
krasynski
and
kornatowski
as
to
general
zimyrski
who
commanded
the
grenadiers
he
was
entirely
blameless
he
had
intended
to
join
the
patriots
at
first
but
was
detained
as
a
prisoner
by
the
russians
the
other
two
generals
persuaded
their
men
that
the
revolutionary
movements
were
only
disturbances
of
the
mob
excited
by
the
students
and
would
quickly
come
to
an
end
they
ought
not
they
told
them
to
forsake
their
legitimate
government
and
the
grand
duke
it
was
impossible
afterwards
for
these
regiments
to
learn
the
truth
as
they
were
closely
surrounded
by
the
russians
and
cut
off
from
all
communication
with
others
early
on
the
third
of
december
when
the
grand
duke
had
resolved
to
depart
he
visited
these
troops
in
person
and
declared
before
them
that
he
left
warsaw
only
to
avoid
useless
bloodshed
and
that
order
would
soon
be
restored
he
requested
them
to
go
with
him
as
they
were
regiments
of
guards
in
whom
the
emperor
had
peculiar
confidence
he
said
you
go
with
us
or
stay
and
unite
with
those
who
have
proved
faithless
to
their
sovereign
with
one
voice
the
whole
corps
exclaimed
will
remain
we
will
join
our
brethren
and
fight
for
the
liberty
of
our
country
we
are
sorry
that
we
could
not
do
so
from
the
beginning
but
we
were
deceived
the
people
who
had
assembled
to
gaze
at
these
unfortunate
men
with
unfavorable
and
unjust
feelings
toward
them
were
disarmed
of
their
resentment
at
the
very
sight
of
them
and
rushed
into
their
embraces
they
were
surrounded
by
the
multitude
and
taken
with
joyful
acclamations
to
the
place
of
the
bank
but
though
the
people
forgave
the
soldiers
their
indignation
remained
unabated
against
their
generals
and
the
greatest
efforts
of
the
leading
patriots
were
required
to
save
krasynski
and
kornatowski
from
their
rage
it
was
dreadful
to
behold
these
generals
riding
with
downcast
looks
not
daring
to
look
on
those
whom
they
had
intended
to
betray
death
would
certainly
have
been
preferable
to
thus
meeting
the
curses
of
a
justly
incensed
people
mothers
held
up
their
children
and
pointing
at
the
two
generals
exclaimed
the
traitors
arriving
at
the
bank
the
people
demanded
that
krasynski
and
kornatowski
should
give
their
reasons
for
having
acted
as
they
had
done
and
as
the
wretched
men
could
say
nothing
in
their
own
defence
a
general
cry
arose
of
to
the
traitors
nothing
but
the
love
of
the
people
for
chlopicki
and
schembeck
who
interceded
could
have
hindered
them
from
carrying
their
wishes
into
immediate
execution
several
excited
individuals
made
their
way
toward
the
culprits
with
pistols
in
their
hands
and
after
aiming
at
them
fired
their
weapons
into
the
air
crying

unworthy
of
a
shot
from
a

hand

to
be
everlastingly
tortured
by
your
consciences
the
unfortunate
men
entreated
that
they
might
be
permitted
to
serve
in
the
ranks
as
privates
they
were
immediately
deprived
of
their
commissions
and
from
that
time
they
lived
in
retirement
during
the
war
the
people
were
this
day
informed
that
prince
adam
czartoriski
had
been
nominated
president
of
the
national
government
that
the
eighteenth
of
december
was
appointed
for
the
opening
of
the
diet
that
till
that
day
the
rights
of
the
emperor
nicholas
would
be
acknowledged
and
that
lubecki
osvowski
and
jezierski
would
be
sent
to
st
petersburgh
as
a
deputation
to
inform
the
emperor
of
all
that
had
happened
they
were
also
to
lay
before
him
the
following
demands
that
all
russian
troops
should
be
withdrawn
from
the
kingdom
forever
that
a
perpetual
conflict
between
the
two
nations
might
be
avoided
that
the
privileges
of
the
constitution
should
be
again
confirmed
in
their
fullest
extent
that
all
the
ancient
polish
provinces
incorporated
with

should
partake
in
the
privileges

appointed
general
sierawski
governor
of
the
city
of
warsaw
and
colonel
count
wonsowicz
chief
of
the

these
officers
were
both
beloved
by
the
people
and
proved
themselves
able
and
zealous
defenders
of

the

sixth

were
remarkable
days
in

thousand

armed

weapons
were
counted
among
them
were
more
than
two
hundred
peasant
girls
with
sickles
these
were
days
of
real
joy
when
all
united
in
the
defence
of

without
distinction
of

was
nominated

sixth
of

the
national
government
notified
chlopicki
of
his
nomination
as
generalissimo
he
replied
that
they
had
no
power
to
place
him
in
that
station
that
in
such
critical
times
the
civil
and
military
power
ought
to
be
vested
in
one
person
and
that
he
felt
himself
entitled
by
his
long
services
to
nominate
himself
dictator
his
powers
he
said
he
would
lay
down
on
the
assemblage
of
the
diet
in
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
he
was
proclaimed
dictator
in
the
champ
de
mars
amidst
the
acclamations
of
an
immense
multitude
after
this
he
took
a
public
oath
to

of

people
and
to
defend
the
rights

privileges

wolicki
requested

with

constantine
coldly
thanked
him
and
immediately
began
to
complain
of
the
poles
in
which
he
was
joined
by
his
lady
he
reproached
the
nation
with
the
benefits
he
had
conferred
on
them
and
seizing
wolicki
violently
by
the
hand
added
for
all
this
they
wanted
to
assassinate
me
when
wolicki
in

most
delicate
manner
represented
that

had
been
entered
with
the
best

toward

greater
exasperation
and
fury
exclaimed
have
chased
me
out
of
the
country
but
i
shall
soon
return
in
his
rage
he
again
seized
wolicki

saying
shall
stay
with

as
a
hostage
for

generals
retained
in

notwithstanding

expostulations
of
wolicki

was
arrested

however
was
not

soon
found

passed
that
night
at

some

wolicki
knew

found
opportunity
to
speak
with
one
of
them
in
the
night
told
him
what
had
befallen
and
desired
him
to
raise
a
false
alarm
as
if
the
poles
were
at
hand
it
was
done
the
citizens
began
to
shout
in
the
streets
and
wolicki
profiting
by
the
fright
and
disorder
of
the
russians
escaped
he
arrived
at
warsaw
on
the
following
day
and
related
his
adventure
which
was
published
as
an
illustration
of
the
grand
duke
perfidy
and
inconsistency
this
conduct
together
with
his
threats
would
have
justified
the
poles
in
pursuing
and
taking
him
with
his
whole
army
prisoners
but
the
nation
generously
suffered
this
opportunity
for
revenge

approached
them
with

shook

with

endeavored

persuade
them
to
return
with
him
said

not

but
set
your
comrades
a
good
example
he
then
offered
them
money
and
other
rewards
indignant
at
his
proposals
the
lancers
replied
we
thank
you
for
the
money
and
promises

but
there
is
no

more
sacred

can
not
forbear
to
record
the
noble
conduct
of
colonel
turno
a
pole
and
to
the
grand
duke
this
officer
had
been
fourteen
years
with
constantine
and
was
one
of
the
few
honest
men
in
his
suite
his
long
endurance
of
his
chief
follies
and
rudeness
could
have
had
no
other
motive
than
the
hope
of
doing
good
to
others
and
preventing
mischief
constantine
loved
him
valued
him
highly
and
was
firmly
convinced
that
turno
would
remain
with
him
what
was
his
surprise
when
at
the
frontier
turno
rode
up
to
take
his
leave
at
first
he
was
unable
to
answer
after
some
time
he
said
with
an
expression
of
heartfelt
grief
and
will
you
leave
me
you
upon
whom
i
had
placed
my
greatest
hopes
whom
i
loved
so
much
who
have
been
with
me
so
long
turno
answered
with
dignity
highness
may
be
assured
that
i
am
sorry
to
part
with
you
i
have
certainly
always
been
your
friend
and
i
am
so
still
i
should
never
leave
you
in
another
cause
no
not
in
the
greatest
distress
on
the
contrary
i
should
be
happy
to
share
every
misfortune
with
you
but
your
highness

circumstances
and
duties
call
me
now
the
highest
and
weightiest
duty
the
duty
a
man
owes
to
his
country
your
highness
i
have
done
all
that
honor
and
duty
commanded
as
your
i
have
accompanied
you
to
the
frontier
that
i
might
be
your
guide
as
long
as
you
should
remain
on
polish
ground
and
preserve
you
from
every
possible
danger
you
need
me
no
longer
you
are
in
your
own
country
and
my
duty
as
your
being
at
an
end
it
is
now
my
sacred
duty
as
a
pole
to
return
at
the
summons
of
my
country

grand
duke
marched
with
his
corps
towards
bialystok
where
he
remained
till
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
in
the
war
he
was
not
ashamed
to
accept
the
command
of
a
corps
of
the
army
and
to
fight
against
those
who
had
treated
him
so
generously
his
promises
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding

suwarrow
had
been
buried
this
altar
was
surrounded
by
more
than
men
who
sent
up
one
voice
to
god
the
twelve
academical
legions
formed
the
innermost
circle
among
whom
those
who
had
been
imprisoned
for
assisting
on
a
similar
occasion
were
conspicuous
in
the
intervals
of
divine
service
and
after
its
termination
several
speeches
were
delivered
one
of
which
was
by
one
of
the
liberated
prisoners
recalling
the
cruelties
perpetrated
by
suwarrow
as
well
as
those
which
we
had
lately
suffered
he
observed
we
were
lately
forbidden
nay
it
was
accounted
a
crime
to
pray
for
our
unfortunate
murdered
ancestors
under
this
free
vault
of
heaven
on
the
grave
of
our
fathers
on
the
soil
moistened
with
their
sacred
blood
which
cries
to
us
for
retribution
in
the
presence
of
their
spirits
hovering
over
us
we
swear
never
to
lay
down
our
arms
till
we
shall
have
avenged
or
fallen
like
them
the
assembled
multitude
then
sung
a
patriotic
hymn
the
sixth
of
december
was
remarkable
for
the
nomination
of
chlopicki
to
the
dictatorship
the
union
of
the
supreme
civil
and
military
powers
in
his
person
the
authority
of
the
provisional
government
was
thus
at
an
end
every
thing
was
referred
to
the
dictator
in
the
afternoon
more
than
persons
assembled
in
the
champ
de
mars
and
the
space
around
it
the
greater
part
of
the
army
too
were
present
chlopicki
came
with
the
senators
and
was
received
by
those
who
had
entrusted
him
with
their
defence
with
shouts
of
joy
his
aspect
was
indeed
venerable
his
silver
head
grown
white
in
the
service
of
poland
bespoke
the
confidence
of
all
the
people
were
informed
by
one
of
the
senators
that
all
the
powers
of
government
had
been
delegated
to
chlopicki
in
order
that
operations
might
be
conducted
with
greater
energy
and
despatch
yet
with
this
restriction
that
his
authority
should
cease
on
the
eighteenth
of
december
this
it
will
be
remembered
was
the
day
fixed
for
the
opening
of
the
diet
to
which
body
all
farther
dispositions
were
referred
the
proclamation
made
chlopicki
himself
addressed
the
people
thus
brethren
the
circumstances
in
which
our
country
is
placed
demand
strict
unity
of
purpose
and
therefore
i
have
thought
it
best
to
accept
the
supreme
power
but
this
is
only
for
a
time
i
shall
resign
it
on
the
meeting
of
the
diet
rely
on
my
experience
which
is
the
fruit
of
long
service
and
on
my
age
which
has
taught
me
the
knowledge
of
mankind
be
assured
that
no
selfish
feeling
has
impelled
me
to
this
step
and
that
i
have
consented
to
take
it
only
to
promote
the
welfare
of
poland
the
truth
of
this
i
call
god
to
may
he
assist
me
to
make
my
promises
good
hail
to
our
dear
country
the
last
sentence
was
clamorously
echoed
by
the
people
with
the
addition
of
its
brave
defender
chlopicki
many
in
the
assembly

subordinate
to
the

on
the
seventh
of
december
the
new
dictator
took
possession
of
the
residence
which
had
been
prepared
for
him
a
guard
of
honor
was
assigned
him
consisting
of
a
company
of
the
academical
legion
the
twelve
companies
of
which
this
legion
was
composed
mounted
guard
in
succession
the
nation
had
conceived
the
highest
hopes
of
chlopicki
they
expected
above
all
the
most
energetic
measures
in
regard
to
the
armament
and
organization
of
the
forces
these
hopes
were
not
fulfilled
at
the
very
commencement
of
his
administration
it
began
to
be
seen
that
this
man
either
from
his
advanced
age
or
the
original
inadequacy
of
his
talents
to
the
demands
of
such
a
situation
would
fail
to
satisfy
the
wants
of
the
nation
indeed
the
union
of
so
many
different
duties
in
the
hands
of
one
individual
demanded
abilities
of
no
ordinary
strength
and
compass
as
might
have
been
expected
the
evident
incapacity
of
chlopicki
early
became
the
occasion
of
dissension
in
the
patriotic
association
already
referred
to
accusations
being
preferred
as
a
matter
of
course
against
those
who
had
been
active
in
procuring
his
investment
with
such
high
powers
the
succeeding
events
will
enable
the
reader
to
decide
for
himself
of
the
justice
of
such
accusations
on
assuming
his
post
the
dictator
adopted
the
following
arrangements
in
regard
to
the
enrollments
of
the
new
forces
and
other
objects
of
military
administration
he
estimated
the
army
already
in
existence
at
men
and
pieces
of
cannon
this
army
was
constituted
as
follows
the
infantry
was
composed
of
nine
regiments
of
two
battalions
each
and
a
battalion
of
sappers
making
a
total
of
men
the
cavalry
was
also
composed
of
nine
regiments
each
regiment
consisting
of
four
squadrons
men
in
all
the
artillery
was
divided
into
nine
battalions
of
eight
pieces
each
in
all
pieces
exclusive
of
the
artillery
in
the
fortresses
of
modlin
and
zamosc
this
force
the
dictator
proposed
to
augment
in
the
following
manner
each
existing
regiment
was
to
receive
a
third
battalion
and
he
intended
to
form
fifteen
new
regiments
of
three
battalions
each
this
would
have
increased
the
total
of
infantry
to
men
without
taking
into
the
account
the
national
guard
of
warsaw
and
the
other
cities
amounting
to
men
the
cavalry
was
to
be
augmented
by
making
a
total
of
to
the
artillery
were
to
be
added
pieces
of
cannon
making
a
total
of
pieces
in
this
estimate
the
dictator
did
not
include
the
aid
that
might
be
calculated
upon
from
the
provinces
of
prussian
austrian
and
russian
poland
the
volunteers
of
every
kind
and
the
regiments
raised
and
equipped
by
the
large
landed
proprietors
for
each
of
the
eight
palatinates
into
which
the
kingdom
was
divided
an
officer
was
appointed
whose
duty
it
was
to
superintend
the
organization
of
the
military
forces
of
which
from
seven
to
eight
thousand
infantry
and
one
thousand
cavalry
were
to
be
furnished
by
each
palatinate
these
officers
were
subordinate
to
two
others
who
had
the
supervision
of
four
palatinates
each
and
bore
the
title
of
these
last
had
the
power
of
appointing
all
the
officers
of
the
new
forces
the
augmentation
of
the
army
was
to
have
been
completed
by
the
twentieth
of
january
but
all
these
arrangements
were
made
on
paper
only
the
government
did
not
press
their
execution
in
fact
such
a
degree
of
negligence
existed
that
in
some
places
where
the
people
assembled
to
be
enrolled
they
found
no
officers
to
receive
them
and
after
waiting
some
time
they
returned
to
their
homes
it
was
in
truth
only
by
the
energy
of
the
nation
which
supplied
the
deficiencies
of
the
administration
that
our
forces
were
ever
in
any
degree
augmented
the
volunteer
force
was
in
an
especial
manner
liberally
furnished
by
the
people
a
similar
state
of
things
existed
with
regard
to
the
fortifications
and
here
again
the
energy
of
the
people
atoned
for
the
negligence
of
the
administration
this
was
especially
the
case
at
warsaw
and
praga
where
all
the
citizens
labored
on
the
works
of
defence
without
distinction
of
age
or
sex
the
construction
of
barricades
in
the
different
streets
of
warsaw
and
of
mines
in
several
parts
of
the
city
was
commenced
by
the
citizens
the
dictator
however
instead
of
occupying
his
attention
with
these
warlike
preparations
devoted
it
to
diplomatic
negociations
and
despatched
emissaries
to
the
neighboring
courts
charged
with
propositions
made
without
the
knowledge
or
the
wish
of
the
nation
and
even
in
some
cases
incompatible
with
its
honor
and
inconsistent
with
the
design
of
the
revolution
all
the
measures
indeed
of
the
dictator
however
well
intended
they
might
have
been
indicated
much
weakness
and
indecision
such
was
the
state
of
affairs
when
an
event
occurred
that
seemed
to
augur
well
for
our
prospects
this
was
the
discovery
of
the
correspondence
between
the
ministers
grabowski
and
lubecki
the
former
being
secretary
of
state
for
poland
and
a
member
of
the
cabinet
at
st
petersburgh
the
latter
minister
of
finance
at
warsaw
this
correspondence
afforded
the
clearest
evidence
that
russia
had
intended
to
declare
war
against
france
and
that
she
was
prepared
to
commence
that
war
in
december
following
these
letters
were
sent
to
paris
in
the
early
part
of
december
by
an
express
and
ought
to
have
convinced
the
french
government
of
the
hostile
intentions
of
russia
they
should
have
satisfied
france
that
our
revolution
and
the
war
that
was
to
follow
were
a
part
of
the
great
struggle
in
which
her
own
existence
was
concerned
the
existing
army
was
through
the
activity
of
the
general
officers
brought
into
such
a
state
by
the
middle
of
december
that
it
could
then
have
taken
the
field
against
the
enemy
the
soldiers
were
eager
for
the
struggle
but
the
delay
of
their
march
gave
color
to
the
supposition
that
an
answer
from
the
emperor
was
waited
for
it
was
even
rumored
that
the
emperor
was
coming
to
warsaw
in
person
all
this
tended
to
damp
the
excitement
of
the
moment
what
then
was
the
astonishment
of
the
nation
when
it
was
found
that
the
monarch
far
from
admitting
the
severity
of
the
oppression
under
which
we
had
suffered
fifteen
years
far
from
giving
a
paternal
audience
to
the
deputies
which
the
nation
had
sent
to
him
and
who
in
its
name
had
presented
the
most
moderate
demands
limited
in
fact
to
the
ratification
and
observance
of
the
constitution
granted
to
us
and
the
union
of
the
polish
provinces
under
one
government
as
had
been
promised
by
alexander
far
from
consenting
to
repair
to
warsaw
as
the
deputies
had
entreated
him
to
do
as
a
father
among
his
children
to
hear
their
complaints
and
satisfy
himself
as
to
their
justice
far
from
all
this
in
a
word
discarding
all
paternal
feelings
he
applied
the
term
to
the
sacred
effort
we
had
been
forced
to
make
by
the
oppression
under
which
we
had
so
long
suffered
the
russian
generals
benkendorf
and
diebitsch
in
a
conversation
of
which
our
revolution
was
the
subject
and
which
took
place
in
an
interview
with
colonel
wielezynski
who
was
one
of
the
deputies
sent
to
the
emperor
spoke
of
a
general
war
as
impending
after
poland
should
be
crushed
colonel
wielezynski
returned
from
st
petersburgh
in
the
latter
part
of
december
bringing
with
him
the
proclamation
which
has
already
been
given
to
the
reader
and
which
being
published
was
received
by
the
people
with
the
utmost
indignation
it
was
an
insult
to
the
honor
and
character
of
the
nation
which
demanded
vengeance
the
day
of
the
promulgation
of
this
document
was
a
day
of
terrible
agitation
the
cry
of
battle
to
battle
was
heard
in
every
quarter
the
nation
demanded
to
be
led
against
the
enemy
at
once
the
word
had
gone
forth
is
no
hope
of
peace
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
people
could
be
restrained
from
rushing
at
once
to
the
field
and
be
persuaded
to
wait
for
a
convocation
of
the
diet
fixed
on
the
of
january
this
delay
was
another
error
for
the
time
which
intervened
was
uselessly
employed
this
diet
in
the
opinion
of
the
nation
could
decide
upon
nothing
short
of
war
upon
a
just
interpretation
of
the
spirit
of
the
emperor
proclamation
no
other
course
could
be
taken
consistently
with
the
national
honor
it
was
in
consequence
of
this
proclamation
of
so
criminatory
so
unjust
so
insulting
a
character
that
nicholas
romanoff
and
his
successors
were
declared
to
have
forfeited
all
claims
to
the
throne
of
poland
and
that
that
throne
was
declared
vacant
the
poles
could
no
longer
submit
to
a
king
who
far
from
being
willing
to
hear
their
complaints
far
from
guarantying
the
rights
secured
by
the
constitution
went
the
length
of
insulting
that
national
honor
to
which
all
history
has
borne
testimony
to
what
a
future
must
poland
under
such
a
king
have
looked
forward
better
were
it
to
risk
the
bloodiest
conflict
nay
to
be
buried
under
the
ruins
of
our
country
than
to
remain
the
vile
slaves
of
a
man
who
relying
on
the
force
which
he
could
control
was
willing
to
take
advantage
of
his
strength
to
be
unjust
the
diet
demanded
of
general
chlopicki
an
account
of
his
trust
in
regard
to
the
military
and
civil
administration
generally
and
in
a
particular
manner
in
regard
to
the
preparation
of
the
forces
the
result
of
this
inquiry
was
to
satisfy
them
that
there
had
been
a
general
negligence
of
his
duties
especially
in
regard
to
the
increase
and
organization
of
the
army
on
examining
the
military
reports
it
was
found
that
only
the
fifth
part
of
the
amount
of
force
ordered
to
be
levied
was
as
yet
enrolled
two
months
had
been
wasted
the
dictator
as
has
been
already
stated
occupied
himself
principally
with
diplomatic
affairs
and
seemed
to
forget
that
the
country
was
to
be
defended
the
diet
saw
that
general
chlopicki
was
hoping
to
finish
the
war
by
conferences
and
that
his
eagerness
for
peace
was
betraying
him
into
a
forgetfulness
of
what
was
due
to
the
national
honor
in
fine
a
correspondence
with
the
emperor
nicholas
was
found
to
have
been
carried
on
by
him
the
dictator
it
was
seen
had
been
equally
neglectful
of
the
different
fortifications
except
at
the
principal
points
praga
zamosc
and
modlin
no
works
of
defence
had
been
constructed
the
important
places
of
serock
and
zegrz
the
former
on
the
narew
and
the
latter
below
the
confluence
of
the
narew
and
the
bug
were
forgotten
as
were
all
the
positions
on
the
great
road
which
leads
from
warsaw
to
brzese
upon
which
or
in
its
vicinity
our
principal
operations
were
to
be
executed
no
point
on
the
frontier
was
strengthened
the
country
was
left
entirely
open
the
diet
considering
all
these
circumstances
resolved
to
send
a
deputation
to
the
dictator
to
demand
of
him
for
the
last
time
what
his
intentions
were
and
to
require
of
him
to
take
the
field
forthwith
as
the
dictator
would
not
submit
himself
to
this
expression
of
the
will
of
the
diet
and
even
opened
to
prince
adam
czartoriski
who
was
one
of
that
deputation
propositions
deemed
inconsistent
with
the
national
honor
the
diet
deprived
him
of
his
trust
the
affairs
of
the
civil
administration
were
confided
as
before
the
dictatorship
to
the
senate
under
the
presidency
of
prince
czartoriski
and
the
command
in
chief
of
the
army
was
given
to
the
prince
michael
radzivil
all
these
powers
were
subordinate
to
the
diet
in
this
manner
ended
the
dictatorship
of
chlopicki
who
afterwards
took
a
place
in
the
suite
of
prince
radzivil
and
was
admitted
into
the
counsels
of
the
administration
of
military
affairs
footnotes
footnote
a
very
important
circumstance
which
either
escaped
the
notice
of
the
dictator
or
was
wilfully
neglected
by
him
respected
the
nomination
and
rank
of
officers
as
the
army
was
to
be
considerably
augmented
a
proportionally
greater
number
of
officers
was
requisite
all
arrangements
upon
this
subject
were
confided
to
the
regimentarz
with
whom
the
important
power
of
making
these
appointments
was
entirely
left
this
course
soon
led
to
trouble
the
regimentarz
not
having
the
power
to
transfer
the
older
officers
of
the
existing
army
excepting
in
cases
where
the
offer
was
made
by
those
officers
were
compelled
to
appoint
new
officers
to
newly
formed
regiments
these
newly
levied
soldiers
were
thus
placed
under
officers
who
were
but
learners
themselves
the
evil
effects
of
this
injudicious
system
were
indeed
sensibly
felt
in
the
first
actions
of
the
campaign
besides
the
evil
here
alluded
to
a
degree
of
jealousy
between
the
old
and
new
officers
resulted
from
the
operation
of
these
arrangements
it
was
natural
for
those
who
were
old
in
service
to
see
with
dissatisfaction
recently
commissioned
officers
placed
above
them
in
rank
instead
then
of
studying
to
preserve
the
utmost
harmony
between
those
who
were
going
forth
together
to
shed
their
blood
in
the
cause
of
their
common
country
that
course
was
in
fact
taken
which
if
it
had
been
designed
to
disturb
this
harmony
would
have
been
deemed
the
most
efficacious
arrangements
for
officering
the
army
might
have
been
made
in
such
a
manner
as
the
following
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
after
dividing
the
officers
into
three
classes
the
first
consisting
of
those
actually
in
service
the
second
of
those
who
had
been
in
service
but
had
given
up
their
commissions
and
were
in
retirement
and
the
third
of
the
newly
commissioned
officers
a
military
commission
might
have
been
formed
who
should
have
before
them
lists
of
officers
showing
their
periods
of
service
this
commission
could
have
designated
the
rank
of
each
upon
an
examination
of
these
lists
placing
the
retired
officers
in
the
grades
in
which
they
stood
at
the
time
of
their
retirement
the
new
regiments
should
have
been
officered
from
the
two
first
classes
advancement
being
made
in
the
grade
of
each
officer
the
third
class
or
the
new
officers
should
have
been
appointed
to
the
vacancies
thus
left
in
the
old
regiments
besides
the
justice
which
such
an
arrangement
would
have
done
to
the
officers
of
older
standing
it
would
have
this
good
effect
the
experienced
officers
would
have
been
more
widely
distributed
through
the
army
and
the
new
regiments
would
have
advanced
more
rapidly
in
organization
and
discipline
general
skrzynecki
clearly
saw
the
defects
of
the
actual
arrangement
but
once
made
it
was
difficult
to
reform
it
he
took
however
every
opportunity
that
offered
to
transfer
the
older
officers
to
advanced
grades
in
the
new
regiments

the

the

of
the

were
unable

incessantly
menaced
by
rebels
who
had
formed
some
illegal
union
among

and
had
gained
an
influence
in

by
separating
from
it
some

named

filling
their
places
with
others
named

who
had
left
warsaw
with
him
to
protect
the
public

from

after

was

dissolved
and
all
its
powers
were
united
in
the
hand
of

general
in

was
spread

inveigle
the
pacific
inhabitants
into
the
power
of

in
this
unfortunate
and
serious
state
of
things
the
cæsarowicz
considered
it
indispensable
to
yield
to
the
request
of
the
government
he
permitted
the
small
body

remained
faithful

him
to

to
insure
as

in

under

the

multitudes

credulous
men
though
already
trembling
in
fear
of
the
chastisement
which
awaits
them
dare
to
think
for
a

of
victory
and
propose
to
us
the

already
you
appreciate
the
sentiments
we
feel
at
the
first
intelligence
of
the
treason
your
response
was
a
new
oath
of
unshaken
fidelity
and
at
this
moment
we
see
but
one
movement
in
the
whole
extent
of
our
vast
empire
but
one
sentiment
animates
all
hearts
the
desire
to
spare
nothing
to
sacrifice
all
even
life
itself
for
the
honor
of
the
emperor
and
the
integrity
of

witness
with
deep
emotion
the
strong
manifestation

the
love

for

might
indeed
answer
you
with
tranquillity
that
new
sacrifices

new
efforts
will
not

necessary

will
be
able

a
decisive
blow
to
bring
to

who
have
dared
to
disturb
her
tranquillity

faithful
troops
who
have
so
recently
distinguished
themselves
by
new
victories
are
already
concentrating
upon
the
western
frontier
of
the

we
are
in
readiness
to
punish
the
perjured
but
we
wish
to
distinguish
the
innocent
from
the
guilty
and
to
pardon
the
weak
who
from
inconsiderateness
or
fear
have
followed
the
current
all

all
the

not
taken

have
proved
by
a
glorious
death
that

the
misguided
compose
no

a
great
part
of
the
army
and
of
the
inhabitants
of

we
have
addressed
ourselves
to
them
by
a
proclamation
on
the
of
this
month
in
which
manifesting
our
just
indignation
against
the
perjured
men
who
have
commenced
this
rebellion
we
gave
orders
to
put
an
end
to
all
illegal
armaments
and
to
restore
every
thing
to
its
former
footing
they
have
yet
time
then
to
repair
the
fault
of
their
compatriots

to
save
the
polish
kingdom
from
the
pernicious
consequences
of
a
blind
criminality

pointing
out
the
only
means
of
safety

make
known
this
manifestation

our
benevolence
toward
our
faithful
subjects
they
will
see
in
it
our
wish
to
protect
the
inviolability
of
the
throne
and
of
the
country

well
as
the
firm
resolution

spare
misguided

justice
without
vengeance
of

in
the
combat

one
of

sent

revolution
has
not

the
merit
of
being
well
timed
you
have
risen
at
the
moment
when
the
whole
force
of
the
empire
was
on
the
march
toward
your
frontiers
to
bring
the
revolutionary
spirits
of
france
and
belgium
to
order
when
the
colonel
observed
that
poland
thought
herself
capable
of
arresting
the
torrent
long
enough
to
give
europe
the
alarm
and
to
prepare
her
for
the
struggle
marshal
diebitsch
answered
what
will
you
gain
by
the
result
we
had
calculated
to
make
our
campaign
on
the
rhine
we
shall
now
make
it
on
the
elbe
or
the
oder
having
crushed
you
first
consider
this
well
footnote
according
to
the
testimony
of
colonel
wielezynski
the
proclamation
of
the
emperor
was
in
entire
contradiction
to
the
sentiments
he
expressed
in
the
conversation
above
mentioned
the
tone
of
that
conversation
was
anything
but
severe
he
even
conceded
that
the
poles
had
just
reason
to
be
discontented
and
admitted
many
of
the
barbarities
of
his
brother
the
grand
duke
constantine
he
promised
colonel
wielezynski
that
he
would
act
with
the
strictest
justice
and
would
consider
it
a
duty
to
inquire
scrupulously
into
and
carefully
distinguish
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
in
regard
to
which
a
manifesto
should
shortly
be
published
as
he
took
leave
of
the
colonel
in
presence
of
diebitsch
and
benkendorf
he
declared
that
he
loved
and
esteemed
the
poles
and
that
these
his
feelings
should
be
the
basis
of
his
course
with
regard
to
them
how
inconsistent
such
language
with
that
of
the
proclamation
footnote
some
letters
of
the
emperor
nicholas
were
found
among
the
papers
of
chlopicki
in
which
the
emperor
expressed
his
thanks
to
him
for
having
taken
the
dictatorship
and
for
the
service
which
he
had
done
to
him
by
the
preservation
of
public
tranquillity
the
emperor
exhorted
him
to
follow
conditions
which
had
been
prescribed
to
him
the
conditions
here
referred
to
could
not
be
found
the
reader
will
permit
me
to
dwell
for
a
moment
upon
the
mode
of
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
emperor
nicholas
which
is
here
indicated
what
conditions
could
nicholas
propose
to
the
dictator
which
the
nation
should
not
know
of
if
those
conditions
were
compatible
with
justice
and
with
the
honor
of
the
nation
why
was
all
this
secrecy
necessary
if
they
were
incompatible
with
justice
and
our
honor
the
dictator
certainly
could
not
have
it
in
his
power
to
make
the
nation
accept
of
them
on
the
contrary
the
nation
who
had
given
him
its
confidence
the
moment
that
it
should
have
been
convinced
that
the
dictator
had
intended
to
compromise
its
honor
would
have
despised
him
as
a
traitor
and
he
would
have
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
its
indignation
to
wish
to
induce
him
on
his
own
responsibility
to
commit
acts
contrary
to
the
honor
of
the
nation
is
to
be
willing
for
selfish
ends
to
induce
him
to
do
that
which
would
render
him
infamous
in
history
is
this
a
course
becoming
a
king
a
conduct
so
insincere
machiavelian
and
even
malignant
is
based
on
the
system
of
intrigue
and
is
in
correspondence
with
the
accustomed
policy
of
the
russian
cabinet
a
policy
which
has
always
brought
divisions
and
misery
upon
the
nations
who
have
been
under
her
power
such
a
system
however
is
far
from
being
ultimately
favorable
to
the
interests
of
russia
herself
for
it
can
never
lead
to
a
sure
result
sooner
or
later
duplicity
will
be
discovered
and
the
more
a
nation
has
been
deceived
the
deeper
will
be
its
determination
of
vengeance
the
letters
referred
to
which
i
believe
are
now
in
the
hands
of
some
of
our
countrymen
will
be
in
the
eyes
of
the

of
the
delay
in
the
preparation
of
the
statement
of
the
force
with
which
the
war
was
actually
commenced
the
dictatorship
had
exercised
a
most
unpropitious
influence
upon
our
affairs
every
movement
had
been
retarded
and
the
most
invaluable
time
was
lost
instead
of
offensive
operations
the
defensive
was
now
necessarily
taken
we
awaited
the
enemy
on
our
native
soil
and
exposed
that
soil
to
his
insults
and
outrages
even
however
at
this
point
the
patriots
called
on
the
government
to
take
the
offensive
but
it
was
too
late
an
immense
russian
army
was
concentrated
upon
our
frontiers
and
was
ready
to
pass
them
our
forces
were
not
strong
enough
to
defend
every
point
against
the
enemy
entrance
it
was
decided
to
keep
our
troops
concentrated
and
presenting
to
him
always
a
narrow
and
recurvated
front
to
lead
the
enemy
to
the
environs
of
warsaw
and
to
give
him
a
decisive
battle
there
on
about
the
of
january
the
prince
radzivil
renewed
the
orders
for
the
most
rapid
organization
of
all
the
different
corps
and
directed
those
corps
which
were
already
organized
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
for
marching
a
division
of
lancers
which
was
in
the
environs
of
siedlce
augmented
by
some
regiments
of
newly
raised
light
cavalry
occupied
as
a
corps
of
observation
all
the
country
between
wlodawa
and
ciechanowiec
and
were
ordered
to
watch
every
movement
of
the
enemy
in
that
region
on
about
the
of
january
the
troops
began
to
leave
warsaw
and
the
other
towns
of
the
department
and
to
concentrate
themselves
upon
a

statement
of
the
existing
army
and
of
the
new

proposed
to
be
levied
the
whole
polish
force
under
the
russian
government
consisted
of
nine

of
two

and
a
battalion
of
sappers
of
men
in
all
nine
regiments
of
four

each
in
all
six

of
eight
pieces
each
and
two
batteries
of
light
artillery
also
of
eight
pieces
each
in
all
pieces
according
to
the
plans
of
the
dictator
the
infantry
was
to
be
augmented
in
the
following
manner
to
each
of
the
existing
regiments
was
to
be
added
a
battalion
of
making
a
total
of
men
he
then
proposed
to
form
fifteen
new
regiments
thus
increasing
the
number
of
regiments
of
infantry
to
each
one
of
the
new
regiments
was
to
be
composed
of
three
battalions
of
men
each
the
total
of
these
new
regiments
would
then
have
been
men
and
the
grand
total
of
the
new
levy
would
be
men
this
body
of
recruits
was
to
be
made
up
from
those
of
the
exempts
their
term
of
service
having
expired
who
were
yet
under
the
age
of
forty
and
from
all
others
under
that
age
and
above
that
of
sixteen
of
this
force
six
thousand
men
was
to
be
furnished
by
warsaw
and
an
equal
number
by
each
of
the
eight
palatinates
besides
this
force
the
enrollment
of
a
national
guard
at
warsaw
of
men
was
ordered
and
in
forming
this
body
no
exemption
was
admitted
except
from
age
or
bodily
infirmity
each
of
the
eight
palatinates
was
also
to
enroll
a
national
guard
of
a
thousand
men
thus
the
whole
national
guard
was
to
consist
of
men
the
cavalry
was
to
be
augmented
as
follows
from
the
whole
it
was
proposed
to
form
a
regiment
of
carabiniers
consisting
of
two
squadrons
of
two
hundred
men
each
to
the
nine
existing
regiments
of
cavalry
it
was
proposed
to
add
as
a
reserve
four
squadrons
of
two
hundred
each
making
in
all
eight
hundred
ten
new
regiments
were
to
be
formed
of
four
squadrons
each
so
that
the
whole
number
of
old
and
new
cavalry
would
be
twenty
regiments
the
whole
augmentation
of
this
army
would
amount
to
the
raising
of
this
force
as
in
the
case
of
the
infantry
was
to
be
equally
divided
between
warsaw
and
each
of
the
eight
palatinates
the
artillery
was
to
be
augmented
by
four

if
we
should
add
to
this
number
the

the
land

at
their
own
expense
detachments
of
volunteers
foreigners
and
detachments
of
partizans
amounting
perhaps
to
the
total
might
be
increased
to
this
force
although
it
would
seem
to
be
disproportionate
to
the
resources
of
the
kingdom
it
was
certainly
possible
to
have
raised
for
the
energy
and
spirit
of
the
people
were
at
the
highest
point
and
every
one
felt
the
importance
of
improving
the
favorable
moment
which
the
general
state
of
europe
and
the
weakness
of
russia
presented
if
the
reader
will
anticipate
the
course
of
events
and
remember
what
a
struggle
against
the
russian
force
of
more
than
men
was
sustained
by
the
only
which
we
actually
brought
into
the
field
he
may
conjecture
what
advantages
might
have
been
expected
from
twice
that
number
which
we
should
certainly
have
brought
to
the
field
had
the
energy
of
the
government
followed
out
its
plans
but
from
the
incapacity
of
the
dictator
for
the
energetic
execution
of
his
trust
these
forces
were
never
raised
and
it
was
soon
seen
that
chlopicki
by
assuming
a
duty
to
which
he
was
unequal
gave
the
first
blow
to
the
rising
fortunes
of
his
country
the
dictator
as
we
have
seen
had
not
even
taken
a
step
towards
the
organization
of
these
forces
and
one
would
have
thought
that
he
had
thrown
out
these
plans
merely
to
blind
the
eyes
of
the
nation
without
having
entertained
the
thought
of
taking
the
field
two
months
passed
away
the
inevitable
moment
of
the
conflict
arrived
and
the
nation
was
obliged
to
march
to
the
fight
with
half
the
force
which
under
an
energetic
administration
it
would
have
wielded
if
we
add
to
this
unfortunate
state
of
things
that
besides
the
threatening
forces
of
our
gigantic
enemy
prussia
and
austria
at
this
late
moment
and
especially
the
former
had
began
to
take
an
attitude
of
hostility
towards
us
and
thus
all
hope
of
sympathy
from
her
neighbors
was
lost
to
poland
the
perilous
nature
of
the
crisis
to
which
the
delay
of
the
dictatorial
government
had
brought
us
thus
unprepared
may
be
imagined
but
poland
did
not
suffer
herself
to
be
discouraged
by
all
these
unpropitious
circumstances
trusting
to
the
righteousness
of
her
cause
she
went
forth

the
contest

to
fall
or
to
be

statement
of
the
forces
with
which
the
war
was
actually
commenced
a
great
exactitude
in
the
computation
of
these
forces
would
be
obviously
impracticable
as
the
precise
number
of
the
detachments
of
volunteers
occasionally
joining
the
army
serving
in
a
particular
locality
only
and
often
perhaps
for
a
limited
period
can
not
be
ascertained
but
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
make
a
pretty
near
approximation
to
the
truth
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
the
forces
were
divided
into
four
divisions
of
infantry
four
of
cavalry
and
twelve
batteries
of
artillery
of
eight
pieces
each
the
whole
infantry
consisted
of
the
nine
existing
regiments
enlarged
by
one
battalion

each
regiment
making
in
all
one
battalion
of
sappers
a
tenth
regiment
of
two
battalions
called
children
of
warsaw
a
battalion
of
volunteers
added
to
the
regiment
different
detachments
of
volunteers

detachments
of
michael
kuszel
and
the
kurpie

foresters
total
of
infantry
the
four
divisions
of
infantry
were
nearly
equal
consisting
of
from
to
men
each
to
each
of
these
divisions
a
corps
of
sappers
was
attached

were
commanded

field
marshal
diebitsch

after
his
retreat

the
detailed
statements
confidently
made
in

the
russian
forces
amounted
to
but
we
reject
one
third
on
the
supposition
that
the
regiments
had
not
been
entirely
completed
if
the
very
thought
of
commencing
a
war
with
such
disproportionate
means
against
so
overwhelming
a
force
should
seem
to
the
reader
to
be
little
better
than
madness
he
will
appreciate
the
energy
and
courage
with
which
it
was
supported
when
he
learns
that
in
from
the
of
february
to
the
of
march
sanguinary
battles
were
fought
with
the
enemy

twice
that
number
of
small
skirmishes

which
as
we
shall
see
that
enemy
was
uniformly
defeated

his
forces
annihilated
footnotes
footnote
the
dictatorship
may
be
said
to
have
been
the
first
of
our
misfortunes
the
dictator
acting
in
contradiction
to
the
spirit
of
the
revolution
did
not
take
advantage
of
that
enthusiasm
with
which
the
revolution
commenced
and
by
which
prodigies
might
have
been
achieved
but
not
only
did
he
neglect
to
make
use
of
that
enthusiasm
or
to
foster
it
he
even
took
measures
which
had
a
tendency
to
repress
it
the
first
fault
with
which
he
was
reproached
by
the
patriotic
club
was
his
having
given
permission
to
the
grand
duke
to
leave
the
kingdom
with
his
corps
taking
with
them
their
arms
and
accoutrements
which
were
really
polish
property
the
retaining
of
the
grand
duke
would
have
been
of
the
greatest
importance
to
us
no
historian
could
have
blamed
such
an
act
for
if
the
justice
of
our
revolution
be
once
acknowledged
every
energetic
and
decisive
act
which
would
favor
its
happy
result
must
also
be
justified
in
the
view
of
history
the
russians
indeed
have
regarded
our
conduct
on
this
point
as
an
indication
of
weakness
and
timidity
rather
than
as
an
act
of
delicacy
and
magnanimity
in
which
light
chlopicki
intended
that
it
should
be
considered
that
same
corps
attached
to
the
grand
duke
consisting
as
we
have
said
of
men
and
cannon
with
the
grand
duke
himself
did
not
regard
it
in
this
light
for
they
fought
against
us
in
the
very
first
battle
another
fault
of
general
chlopicki
was
not
to
have
taken
immediately
the
offensive
passed
the
bug
and
entered
the
brother
provinces
which
had
been
incorporated
with
russia
the
russian
troops
especially
those
in
lithuania
were
not
in
a
state
to
resist
the
first
impetuosity
of
our
national
forces
the
russian
soldiers
as
the
reader
probably
knows
are
not
except
in
the
large
cities
concentrated
in
barracks
as
in
other
states
of
europe
but
are
dispersed
in
quarters
throughout
the
country
in
small
bodies
so
that
sometimes
a
single
regiment
may
be
spread
to
a
circumference
which
may
embrace
eighty
to
a
hundred
villages
with
perhaps
from
ten
to
thirty
soldiers
only
in
each
in
fact
the
soldiers
of
a
company
may
have
often
from
six
to
twelve
miles
march
to
reach
the
quarters
of
their
captain
all
this
made
the
concentration
of
these
forces
an
affair
of
time
and
difficulty
and
one
regiment
after
another
could
have
been
fallen
upon
and
their
whole
forces
annihilated
in
detail
and
that
without
much
effusion
of
blood
besides
this
the
russian
corps
of
lithuania
was
composed
in
part
of
our
brethren
enrolled
in
that
province
and
even
commanded
in
part
by
officers
natives
of
that
province
they
would
of
course
have
united
themselves
with
us
and
the
revolution
would
have
spread
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
to
the
very
borders
of
the
dwina
and
the
dnieper
and
after
this
not
four
millions
alone
but
sixteen
millions
of
poles
would
have
been
united
in
one
cause
at
a
later
period
all
this
was
no
longer
possible
russia
began
to
become
alive
to
the
danger
of
the
occurrence
of
such
a
state
of
things
and
all
the
regiments
with
polish
soldiers
in
their
ranks
were
withdrawn
into
the
interior
and
three
hundred
polish
officers
in
the
russian
service
were
sent
to
take
commands
in
regiments
posted
in
the
regions
about
the
caucasus
in
asia
the
dictator
who
gave
as
a
reason
for
not
having
taken
the
above
course
that
the
neighboring
cabinets
would
have
taken
umbrage
at
it
as
a
violation
of
a
foreign
territory
can
with
difficulty
be
conceived
to
have
really
felt
that
this
would
have
been
the
case
even
if
such
apprehensions
were
well
founded
are
diplomatic
formalities
to
be
regarded
on
an
occasion
like
this
should
we
in
such
a
cause
forbear
from
apprehensions
of
this
kind
to
press
on
to
the
delivery
of
our
brethren
from
the
despotism
under
which
they
were
suffering
but
in
fact
the
true
interests
of
those
cabinets
were
to
be
found
in
what
every
sagacious
observer
of
european
history
has
pointed
out
as
the
great
safeguard
of
europe
the
establishment
of
the
polish
kingdom
as
a
barrier
against
the
threatening
preponderance
of
our
barbarous
enemy
it
was
indeed
ridiculous
to
require
of
the
poles
that
they
should
regard
as
their
only
limits
the
little
kingdom
into
which
the
violence
and
fraud
of
the
combined
sovereigns
had
contracted
them
the
poles
in
entering
those
provinces
would
have
been
still
on
the
soil
of
their
ancient
country
and
in
fact
the
revolution
was
equally
justifiable
at
wilna
kiow
and
smolensk
as
at
warsaw
the
patriots
indeed
who
began
the
latter
did
not
think
of
their
own
sufferings
alone
they
bore
in
mind
also
the
even
greater
sufferings
of
their
brethren
who
were
more
absolutely
in
the
power
of
despotism
it
was
indeed
the
great
end
of
the
patriots
and
of
the
nation
the
union
of
all
the
provinces
of
ancient
poland
which
was
abandoned
by
the
dictator
nothing
else
in
fact
but
the
forcing
of
the
frontiers
would
have
subdued
the
arrogance
of
the
emperor
and
forced
him
to
listen
to
our
claims
the
unanimous
voice
of
sixteen
millions
of
poles
could
not
have
safely
been
despised
this
compulsory
amelioration
of
our
condition
would
have
also
spared
nicholas
the
remorse
with
which
he
must
reflect
on
the
sacrifice
of
nearly
lives
and
the
death
or
suffering
to
which
he
has
condemned
and
is
still
condemning
the
best
spirits
of
poland

liberty
would
have
desired
to
have
brought
together
all
the
autocrats
of
the
world
to
witness
the
animation
with
which
our
national
troops
went
forth
to
engage
in
the
combat
for
liberty
perhaps
they
would
have
been
involuntarily
struck
with
the
conviction
that
this
liberty
must
be
a
blessing
when
men
will
sacrifice
themselves
so
cheerfully
to
achieve
it
when
the
march
was
commenced
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
neighboring
country
left
their
homes
to
witness
the
departure
and
all
the
plains
about
warsaw
and
the
road
sides
between
warsaw
and
siedlce
were
covered
with
people
the
soldiers
in
marching
through
the
streets
of
the
city
passed
between
lines
of
people
composed
of
senators
officers
of
the
government
the
clergy
children
from
the
schools
the
members
of
the
national
guard
and
in
short
an
immense
assembly
of
both
sexes
reaching
even
to
two
miles
beyond
praga
all
the
regiments
passed
in
review
before
the
general
in
chief
and
each
regiment
took
the
oath
to
defend
their
country
to
the
last
drop
of
their
blood
exclamations
such
as
these
were
constantly
uttered
general
if
you
see
us
turn
from
before
the
enemy
point
the
artillery
against
us
and
annihilate
our
ranks
the
fourth
regiment
the
bravest
of
the
brave
knowing
that
our
magazines
were
ill
provided
with
powder
refused
at
first
to
receive
any
cartridges
but
on
the
remonstrance
of
the
chief
they
agreed
to
take
thirty
each
man
half
of
the
complement
for
one
battle
saying
that
they
would
furnish
themselves
afterwards
from
the
russians
they
then
entreated
the
commander
in
chief
never
to
send
them
against
a
smaller
body
of
the
enemy
than
a
division
and
to
use
them
wherever
a
decisive
blow
was
required
dear
general
said
they
we
have
no
powder
but
trust
to
our
bayonets
it
was
truly
affecting
to
witness
the
parting
of
the
soldiers
from
their
friends
and
relatives
fathers
taking
leave
of
children
children
of
fathers
husbands
of
wives
and
to
hear
the
cries
of
sorrow
mingled
with
animating
shouts
and
patriotic
hymns
these
are
moments
of
which
i
am
unequal
to
the
description
but
which
every
freeman
will
form
a
conception
of
moments
of
the
struggle
between
domestic
happiness
and
public
duty
moments
which
show
that
the
love
of
country
is
the
most
powerful
of
all
sentiments
and
that
men
will
sacrifice
every
thing
under
its
impulses

concentrate
themselves

general
points
were
designated
for

of
this
enormous

wlodawa
marshal
diebitsch
on
entering
the
kingdom
published
a
proclamation
to
the
poles
a
copy
of
which
is
given
in
the
note
illustration
those
proclamations
were
published
in
the
latter
part
of
january
the
people
were
disgusted
with
their
promises
and
their
menaces
and
rejecting
all
idea
of
reconciliation
on
such
terms
as
these
proclamations
set
forth
they
entreated
to
be
led
to
the
struggle
in
which
they
had
once
decided
to
engage
preferring
every
sacrifice
to
so
degrading
a
submission
they
demanded
that
an
answer
should
be
sent
to
diebitsch
informing
him
that
they
were
ready
to
meet
him
and
called
upon
the
government
to
commence
hostilities
without
a
delay
the
russian
forces

no
consisting
as
we
have
already
mentioned
of
about
men

the

designated
for
the
entrance
of
the
different

the
russian
corps
embraced
an
extent
of
english
miles
this
space
was
almost
wholly
occupied
by
either
small
or
large
detachments
general
diebitsch
meaning
to
attack
our
centre
at
siedlce
with
a
part
of
his
army
intended
to
outflank
us
with
the
rest
and
to
march
directly
upon
warsaw
and
thus
following
the
plan
of
napoleon
in
the
campaign
of
prussia
in
at
jena
and
auerstacdt
to
cripple
our
front
and
to
put
an
end
to
the
war
in
a
moment
the
plans
of
this
renowned
commander
were
well
understood
by
our
general
officers
and
to
resist
them
it
was
determined
to
contract
our
forces
into
a
line
of
operations
narrow
but
concentrated
and
strong
a
course
which
our
inferiority
of
force
seemed
to
require
this
line
was
posted
as
follows
our
left
wing
consisting
of
the
fourth
division
of
general
szembek
and
a
division
of
cavalry
under
general
uminski
was
in
the
environs
of
pultusk
this
wing
sent
its
reconnoissances
towards
ostrolenka
in
the
environs
of
the
town
of
jadow
was
the
division
of
general
krukowiecki
and
in
the
environs
of
wengrow
the
division
of
general
skrzynecki
with
the
division
of
cavalry
commanded
by
general
lubinski
the
centre
of
our
position
was
about
half
way
between
the
two
latter
places
our
right
wing
was
at
siedlce
and
was
composed
of
the
division
of
infantry
under
general
zymirski
and
the
division
of
cavalry
under
general
stryinski
to
cover
the
right
wing
a
small
corps
under
the
command
of
general
dwernicki
was
posted
at
seroczyn
that
corps
consisted
of
infantry
horse
and
three
pieces
of
cannon
different
patrols
of
cavalry
were
employed
in
observing
the
enemy
along
the
whole
space
between
sokolow
miendzyrzec
and
parczewo
the
rivers
narew
n
bug
b
and
liewiec
l
covered
the
whole
line
of
our
operations
and
made
it
sufficiently
strong
our
centre
especially
was
well
posted
between
jadow
wengrow
and
siedlce
it
was
protected
by
the
great
marshes
formed
by
the
river
lieviec
l
excepting
in
a
few
points
which
were
well
fortified
these
marshes
were
wholly
impassable
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
this
position
was
not
made
still
stronger
by
more
ample
fortifications
besides
making
the
passage
of
this
point
cost
a
more
severe
loss
to
the
enemy
such
fortifications
would
have
enabled
us
to
spare
one
whole
division
for
other
purposes
fortifications
of
positions
should
always
be
the
more
freely
combined
with
tactics
in
proportion
to
the
inferiority
of
a
force
in
the
above
mentioned
position
we
were
to
await
the
first
shock
of
the
enemy
after
which
the
army
was
to
retire
slowly
towards
the
environs
of
praga
and
in
such
a
manner
that
each
corps
should
always
be
on
the
parallel
with
the
rest
in
this
retreat
each
corps
was
required
to
profit
by
every
opportunity
to
cause
the
utmost
loss
to
the
enemy
and
to
harass
him
as
much
as
possible
by
a
retreat
of
this
nature
it
was
intended
to
draw
the
enemy
on
to
the
walls
of
warsaw
and
having
weakened
him
during
such
a
retreat
to
give
him
a
decisive
battle

and
your
fidelity
a
short
time
since
he
gladly
did
justice
to
your
devotedness
and
your
good
will
the
exemplary
conduct
of
all
the
polish
officers
without
exception
who
partook
with
our
armies
the
fatigues
and
the
glory
of
the
turkish
war
had
given
a
high
satisfaction
to
his
majesty
we
accepted
with
pleasure
this
fraternity
of
arms
which
became
a
new
bond
between
the
russian
and
polish
troops
the
best
hope
of
reciprocal
advantages
should
connect
with
that
union
which
was
founded
upon
all
that
is
sacred
in
military
honor
those
hopes
have
been
cruelly
deceived
a
handful
of
young
men
who
have
never
known
the
dangers
of
battle
of
young
officers
who
had
never
passed
through
a
campaign
or
even
a
march
have
shaken
the
fidelity
of
the
brave
the
latter
have
seen
committed
in
their
ranks
the
greatest
of
crimes
the
murder
of
their
commanders
they
have
not
arrested
the
revolt
against
their
legitimate
sovereign
what
unhappy
blindness
what
criminal
condescension
has
been
able
to
induce
these
veterans
to
permit
the
consummation
of
the
greatest
of
offences
and
to
join
themselves
with
those
whose
hands
were
stained
with
blood
can
it
be
possible
that
the
design
of
rendering
a
service
to
their
country
has
been
made
for
a
moment
a
pretext
for
such
conduct
that
country
can
answer
that
for
a
long
period
she
had
never
enjoyed
so
much
happiness
she
had
attained
much
and
she
could
still
hope
much
from
her
fidelity
and
the
support
of
public
order
she
exposes
herself
to
the
loss
of
all
these
advantages
by
engaging
in
an
unequal
struggle
in
revolting
against
a
sovereign
whose
firm
and
energetic
character
is
well
known
and
in
braving
a
power
which
has
never
been
defied
with
impunity

stamp
upon
your
front
the
stain
of
dishonor
put
away
from
you
such
an
ignominy

will
one
day
relate
that
in
the
hope
of
serving
your
country
you
have
been
faithful
and
devoted
to
the
man
who
promised
you
every
thing
and
kept
his
promise
in
nothing
shall
it
also
say
that
paying
with
ingratitude
and
perjury
the
sovereign
who
has
generously
granted
you
every
thing
which
you
had
any
right
to
hope
for
you
have
drawn
down
upon
your
country
new
misfortunes
and
upon
yourselves
an
indelible
disgrace
if
some
grievances
existed
you
should
have
had
confidence
enough
in
the
character
of
our
august
sovereign
to
have
laid
before
him
your
complaints
in
a
legal
manner
and
with
that
frankness
which
characterizes
the
true
soldier
and
i
too
poles
i
speak
the
sincere
language
of
a
soldier
i
have
never
known
any
other
obedient
to
the
orders
of
my
sovereign
i
reiterate
by
his
wishes
all
the
propositions
which
in
his
clemency
he
has
already
made
to
you
by
his
proclamation
of
the
of
december
our
august
sovereign
has
witnessed
with
marked
satisfaction
the
fidelity
of
the
brave
of
the
guard
of
the
greater
part
of
the
grenadiers
of
the
guard
and
of
the
of
the
cavalry
he
does
not
doubt
that
the
greater
part
of
the
troops
cherished
the
desire
to
remain
faithful
to
their
oaths
and
that
many
others
were
hurried
away
only
by
the
impulse
of
the
moment
let
each
one
hasten
to
execute
the
orders
which
are
contained
in
the
proclamation
of
his
majesty
but
if
unforeseen
circumstances
do
not
permit
you
to
follow
the
course
which
has
been
pointed
out
to
you
at

on
the
approach
of
the
faithful
armies
of
our
common
sovereign

your
duties
and
your
oaths
it
is
not
as
enemies
that
the
troops
placed
under
my
command
enter

it
is
on
the
contrary
with
the

all

know
how
to

with
the
constancy
and
courage
which
they
have
ever
manifested
the
resistance
which
men
may
attempt
to
oppose
to
them
men
who
trampling
under
foot
the
sacredness
of
their
oaths

the
laws
of
honor
sacrifice
to
their
ambitious

criminal
projects

myself
with

i
have

as
my
worthy
brothers

from
the
momentary
error
to
which
you
have
been
capable
of
surrendering
yourselves

you
may
in
joining
the
rebellious

them
back
to
their
duties

serve
your
country

by
that
restore
the
happiness
of
your
country

clemency
of
our
august

well

responsibility
which
you
will
take
upon
your
heads
by
a
criminal
obstinacy

yourselves
to
your

still
worthy
to

men
hardened
in

who
can
not

on
the
right
wing
at
minsk
the
tenth
of
february
was
the
first
day
after
an
interval
of
fifteen
years
of
the
encounter
between
the
russian
and
polish
arms
mendzyrzec
was
the
place
in
which
the
first
fire
was
given
and
the
little
skirmish
which
took
place
there
was
of
good
presage
on
the
morning
of
that
day
two
regiments
of
cossacks
showed
themselves
upon
the
plain
before
the
town
on
which
were
posted
two
regiments
of
krakus
or
light
cavalry
and
the
regiment
of
lancers
as
an
advanced
guard
our
cavalry
were
impatient
to
engage
with
the
enemy
and
begged
of
their
commander
to
be
allowed
to
attack
him
when
it
was
seen
that
this
body
of
the
enemy
was
detached
from
his
larger
force
permission
was
given
to
one
of
the
two
new
regiments
of
light
cavalry
supported
by
a
squadron
of
the
old
cavalry
as
a
reserve
to
throw
themselves
upon
the
enemy
in
a
moment
our
cavalry
were
among
the
ranks
of
the
cossacks
both
of
the
enemy
regiments
were
dispersed
and
one
squadron
with
six
officers
were
taken
prisoners
the
enemy
was
not
pursued
our
troops
being
satisfied
with
this
successful
attack
and
with
having
excited
the
first
consternation
in
the
ranks
after
this
skirmish
our
cavalry
in
obedience
to
previous
instructions
retired
to
the
environs
of
siedlce
in
this
town
was
a
little
garrison
consisting
of
a
regiment
of
light
infantry
and
a
detachment
of
riflemen
formed
and
commanded
by
michael
kuszel
on
the
at
about
the
whole
of
the
advanced
guard
of
the
russian
centre
which
was
commanded
by
diebitsch
in
person
reached
the
environs
of
siedlce
and
took
position
there
before
the
night
set
in
other
russian
columns
began
to
place
themselves
upon
the
same
plain
their
advanced
guard
then
recommenced
the
march
throwing
their
tirailleurs
forward
who
began
a
warm
fire
which
was
answered
by
our
own
light
troops
who
were
placed
in
the
faubourgs
and
the
sides
of
the
town
the
brave
detachment
of
kuszel
riflemen
who
were
finely
trained
and
equipped
caused
a
great
loss
to
the
enemy
the
russian
artillery
to
protect
their
tirailleurs
and
the
columns
of
infantry
which
followed
them
commenced
a
heavy
fire
upon
the
faubourgs
occupied
by
our
infantry
this
fire
of
the
russian
artillery
was
ineffectual
but
our
own
fire
as
the
russians
were
exposed
in
an
open
plain
was
very
destructive
the
action
continued
until
dark
when
our
infantry
began
to
evacuate
the
town
and
marched
to
rejoin
the
divisionary
camp
which
was
about
a
mile
in
the
rear
illustration
at
general
zymirski
supposing
that
the
enemy
had
taken
possession
of
the
town
determined
to
make
an
attack
with
two
regiments
upon
the
town
and
the
russian
camp
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
the
regiment
of
the
line
and
the
regiment
of
light
infantry
which
were
designated
for
this
object
fell
with
impetuosity
upon
the
enemy
whom
they
found
in
an
wholly
unprepared
state
a
few
hundred
prisoners
were
the
fruits
of
this
attack
after
which
our
forces
evacuated
the
town
these
little
advantages
gained
in
those
two
days
retarded
the
advance
of
the
enemy
he
remained
inactive
on
the
and
on
the
the
russian
corps
under
the
command
of
general
kreutz
composed
of
men
and
pieces
of
cannon
attacked
the
small
corps
of
observation
on
our
right
under
the
command
of
general
dwernicki
combat
of
stoczek
ii
general
dwernicki
although
aware
of
the
vast
superiority
of
the
enemy
force
yet
trusting
in
the
strength
of
his
own
position
determined
to
meet
his
attack
and
give
him
battle
the
position
of
stoczek
was
strong
in
several
respects
first
from
its
commanding
elevation
secondly
from
the
circumstance
that
the
town
is
protected
by
the
river
swider
which
forms
marshes
that
are
not
passable
but
by
a
dyke
at
a
short
distance
from
the
city
in
the
direction
in
which
the
russian
army
was
approaching
that
dyke
was
defended
by
the
whole
artillery
of
our
corps
consisting
of
three
pieces
and
the
declivity
descending
toward
the
dyke
was
occupied
by
two
companies
of
light
troops
dispersed
in
favorable
positions
as
and
in
such
a
manner
as
to
act
on
the
dyke
general
dwernicki
divided
his
forces
into
the
smallest
possible
bodies
to
give
an
appearance
of
extent
to
his
line
and
thus
mask
his
inferiority
of
force
leaving
a
battalion
of
infantry
to
protect
the
artillery
and
prevent
the
passage
of
the
dyke
which
passage
he
was
sure
that
the
enemy
could
not
possibly
execute
rapidly
and
that
this
small
force
was
sufficient
if
not
to
prevent
at
least
to
retard
it
he
took
the
two
battalions
which
made
the
remainder
of
his
force
and
throwing
them
upon
the
right
bank
a
of
this
river
in
the
forest
where
an
easier
and
safer
passage
was
open
to
the
enemy
he
there
awaited
the
enemy
movements
the
first
step
of
the
russians
was
to
place
all
their
artillery
at
the
nearest
possible
point
to
our
position
and
to
commence
a
warm
fire
upon
the
town
under
this
fire
they
thought
to
effect
the
passage
of
the
dyke
general
dwernicki
ordered
his
artillery
not
to
fire
until
the
russian
columns
should
make
their
appearance
on
the
dyke
and
then
to
open
a
fire
of
grape
upon
them
in
this
manner
some
hours
passed
during
which
the
russian
artillery
kept
up
an
ineffectual
fire
and
the
russian
corps
executed
various
manoeuvres
in
attempting
to
force
the
passage
of
the
dyke
and
in
pushing
their
attack
in
the
direction
of
the
forest
general
kreutz
seeing
that
his
attempts
to
force
the
dyke
were
attended
with
severe
loss
and
thinking
that
in
the
other
direction
the
passage
would
be
much
more
easy
decided
on
a
general
attack
in
that
quarter
he
divided
his
corps
leaving
one
part
before
the
dyke
and
with
the
remainder
advanced
to
the
attack
of
our
right
a
strong
columns
of
russian
infantry
and
cavalry
marched
against
it
as
soon
as
this
manoeuvre
was
observed
by
dwernicki
the
idea
was
conceived
by
him
of
preventing
the
attack
by
throwing
himself
with
the
utmost
impetuosity
upon
the
enemy
before
he
had
taken
a
position
and
while
on
the
march
he
renewed
his
orders
to
defend
with
the
utmost
firmness
the
passage
of
the
dyke
and
taking
all
the
cavalry
with
him
he
passed
over
towards
the
forest
and
with
the
united
force
of
this
cavalry
and
the
infantry
who
were
concealed
in
the
forest
he
threw
himself
upon
the
russian
artillery
and
the
cavalry
which
was
protecting
it
in
a
moment
both
artillery
and
cavalry
were
completely
overthrown
and
dispersed
and
seven
pieces
of
cannon
remained
in
our
hands
the
disorder
communicated
itself
to
the
columns
which
were
on
the
march
who
thought
no
longer
of
following
up
their
attack
but
retreated
as
fast
as
possible
and
in
fact
a
general
and
disorderly
retreat
commenced
the
ruin
of
their
left
wing
caused
a
consternation
in
the
forces
composing
their
right
who
not
knowing
what
had
happened
ceased
their
fire
quitted
their
position
and
joined
in
the
general
retreat
besides
the
killed
and
wounded
more
than
prisoners
with
twenty
officers
were
taken
together
with
a
great
quantity
of
ammunition
baggage
among
which
were
several
voitures
containing
the
chapels
of
the
camp
the
enemy
was
followed
a
short
distance
only
as
the
inferiority
of
our
force
would
not
of
course
admit
of
an
extended
pursuit
and
it
was
an
important
object
also
with
general
dwernicki
not
to
permit
the
enemy
to
discover
that
inferiority
he
contented
himself
therefore
with
having
destroyed
nearly
a
third
part
of
the
enemy
corps
and
with
having
thrown
his
whole
force
into
the
greatest
consternation
this
brilliant
affair
was
the
commencement
of
the
remarkable
career
of
general
dwernicki
and
it
was
a
propitious
opening
for
our
campaign
general
dwernicki
resumed
his
former
position
at
stoczek
where
he
awaited
the
orders
which
the
commander
in
chief
might
issue
on
receiving
the
report
of
what
had
taken
place
to
make
this
position
more
strong
he
ordered
a
barricade
of
trees
to
be
made
at
the
termination
of
the
dyke
and
at
the
other
points
where
the
approach
was
easy
and
in
order
to
keep
a
close
observation
upon
the
enemy
he
sent
patrols
in
the
direction
of
kock
and
zelechow
while
thus
occupied
he
received
orders
to
leave
his
position
immediately
by
a
rapid
march
in
the
direction
of
zelechow
and
macieiowice
then
to
pass
the
vistula
and
meet
the
russian
corps
under
the
command
of
the
prince
wirtemburg
who
after
having
crossed
that
river
at
pulawa
had
made
a
demonstration
on
its
left
bank
and
was
approaching
warsaw
on
receiving
these
orders
general
dwernicki
left
stoczek
on
the
same
night
in
consequence
of
the
enemy
attack
upon
dwernicki
corps
which
covered
our
right
wing
that
wing
was
inclined
and
withdrawn
towards
kaluszyn
in
order
not
to
be
exposed
to
the
enemy
demonstrations
upon
its
flank
or
rear
the
town
of
minsk
was
also
occupied
by
a
detachment
on
the
the
russians
made
a
simultaneous
attack
on
wengrow
and
kaluszyn
but
the
principal
attack
was
intended
to
be
directed
against
kaluszyn
or
rather
the
village
of
boimie
adjoining
it
at
wengrow
the
attack
was
masked
by
a
strong
attack
upon
our
right
wing
the
enemy
had
the
design
of
gaining
the
great
road
to
warsaw
a
plan
which
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
for
us
to
defeat
for
if
he
should
have
succeeded
in
forcing
our
right
wing
he
would
have
cut
off
our
communications
with
the
corps
of
general
skrzynecki
and
krukowiecki
which
were
in
a
more
advanced
position
our
generals
saw
the
necessity
of
the
most
determined
defence
of
the
position
and
general
zymirski
resolved
to
resist
to
the
last
extremity
battle
of
boimie
iii
the
battle
of
boimie
consisted
of
a
persevering
effort
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
to
force
the
passage
of
a
dyke
under
the
protection
of
the
fire
of
a
strong
battery
of
artillery
on
our
side
every
effort
was
directed
to
the
making
of
the
passage
of
that
dyke
as
destructive
as
possible
to
the
enemy
for
this
object
our
arrangements
were
made
as
follows
on
the
night
of
the
we
destroyed
the
bridges
over
the
small
river
of
kostrzyn
which
traverses
the
dyke
or
main
road
in
two
places
not
far
from
the
nearest
bridge
a
defence
of
branches
of
trees
was
thrown
together
which
having
been
well
placed
made
a
good
cover
for
our
marksmen
and
for
a
battalion
of
infantry
which
were
concealed
behind
them
the
fire
of
grape
from
the
enemy
artillery
was
rendered
ineffective
to
a
great
degree
by
this
mass
of
trees
upon
the
nearest
elevations
of
ground
b
general
zymirski
placed
eighteen
pieces
of
cannon
the
fire
of
which
was
concentrated
upon
the
dyke
by
this
means
every
attempt
of
the
enemy
to
the
bridge
was
made
to
cost
him
a
severe
loss
and
was
rendered
ineffectual
the
main
body
of
our
forces
was
placed
without
the
reach
of
the
enemy
artillery
on
the
left
of
our
position
at
the
distance
of
about
half
a
mile
a
small
road
led
to
dobre
and
that
road
was
intersected
by
the
small
river
above
mentioned
the
bridge
which
continued
the
road
over
this
river
was
destroyed
by
us
and
a
small
detachment
placed
there
to
prevent
its
reconstruction
and
its
passage
by
the
enemy
illustration
iii
such
was
the
distribution
of
the
small
force
which
profiting
by
the
strength
of
its
position
was
able
to
meet
the
attacks
of
the
numerous
body
of
the
enemy
commanded
by
marshal
diebitsch
in
person
and
which
were
renewed
during
the
whole
day
the
details
of
the
action
are
as
follows
at
about
on
the
morning
of
the
the
russian
force
commenced
debouching
from
the
forests
which
border
the
main
road
between
mingosy
and
boimie
and
deploying
to
the
right
and
left
took
position
in
a
short
time
the
field
was
covered
with
the
enemy
masses
his
force
consisted
of
twelve
regiments
of
infantry
six
of
cavalry
and
sixty
pieces
of
cannon
it
was
at
about
noon
that
the
enemy
placed
his
artillery
upon
the
heights
a
above
the
bridge
and
commenced
his
fire
after
continuing
for
some
time
this
fire
which
was
but
occasionally
answered
by
our
artillery
the
enemy
sent
several
battalions
in
column
upon
the
bridge
a
part
of
which
force
engaged
in
the
repair
of
the
bridge
and
the
rest
attempted
to
make
the
passage
every
approach
of
the
enemy
was
met
with
a
warm
fire
from
behind
the
defence
of
trees
above
mentioned
and
our
artillery
at
the
same
time
opened
a
destructive
fire
of
grape
upon
the
bridge
the
attempts
of
the
enemy
were
renewed
for
some
hours
in
vain
finding
the
impossibility
of
forcing
this
passage
he
directed
his
efforts
to
that
on
his
right
d
and
sent
a
cloud
of
light
infantry
and
cavalry
to
attempt
to
pass
the
marshes
and
ford
the
stream
but
this
passage
was
equally
impossible
and
several
russian
regiments
who
were
engaged
in
the
attempt
exposed
themselves
to
a
severe
fire
of
platoons
from
our
troops
and
several
staff
officers
of
the
enemy
were
killed
at
the
head
of
those
regiments
in
these
renewed
and
bloody
attempts
the
day
passed
away
and
as
the
night
approached
our
troops
quietly
evacuated
their
position
and
took
another
a
few
miles
in
the
rear
as
to
the
affair
at
wengrow
it
was
only
an
engagement
with
the
rear
guard
of
the
corps
of
general
skrzynecki
that
general
knowing
his
position
to
be
too
far
advanced
decided
to
retire
as
far
as
the
environs
of
dobre
this
retreat
was
so
orderly
that
it
seemed
rather
an
evolution
than
a
retreat
all
the
movements
were
executed
with
perfect
coolness
and
the
alternate
retreat
and
fire
of
the
different
battalions
the
displaying
and
closing
of
the
columns
the
change
of
front
c
were
executed
with
such
precision
that
it
impressed
the
enemy
with
a
certain
degree
of
respect
and
though
three
times
superior
in
force
he
did
not
attempt
to
push
his
attack
in
this
manner
the
corps
arrived
at
the
village
of
makowiec
where
it
took
position
on
the
next
day
with
the
exception
of
a
few
light
skirmishes
between
the
outposts
nothing
of
importance
took
place
the
right
wing
received
on
that
day
the
order
to
fall
back
as
far
as
minsk
some
miles
in
the
rear
of
their
former
position
on
the
evening
of
that
day
the
line
of
operation
of
our
army
was
as
follows
our
left
wing
was
at
zegrz
the
centre
in
the
environs
of
dobre
and
the
right
wing
at
minsk
on
the
the
enemy
attacked
our
centre
at
dobre
and
our
right
at
minsk
it
was
a
day
of
great
bloodshed
along
our
whole
line
but
like
the
preceding
highly
honorable
to
our
arms
battle
of
makowiec
and
dobre
iv
this
battle
is
generally
known
by
the
name
of
the
battle
of
dobre
but
as
it
was
fought
in
two
different
positions
and
with
two
different
plans
of
operation
i
have
given
the
name
of
the
two
general
positions
in
speaking
of
the
battle
general
skrzynecki
was
as
we
have
already
remarked
in
a
position
too
far
in
advance
of
our
right
wing
and
as
the
enemy
on
that
day
had
attacked
as
we
have
also
stated
the
right
wing
and
the
centre
simultaneously
and
could
have
made
as
will
be
seen
by
the
plan
a
demonstration
on
stanislawow
and
thus
have
acted
on
the
rear
of
skrzynecki
which
was
nearest
to
him
that
general
had
two
objects
to
effect
first
to
make
the
attack
of
the
enemy
as
costly
to
him
as
possible
and
next
to
arrange
his
retrograde
movement
in
such
a
manner
as
to
be
able
to
reach
stanislawow
by
night
both
of
these
designs
were
exceedingly
well
executed
upon
each
of
his
positions
he
was
master
of
his
own
movements
and
quitted
them
at
his
own
time
this
affair
of
the
of
february
was
the
occasion
of
the
first
development
of
the
remarkable
talents
of
this
commander
it
was
then
that
he
first
awakened
the
high
expectations
and
gained
the
confidence
of
the
nation
which
soon
after
committed
to
him
the
trust
so
honorably
and
faithfully
executed
by
him
in
regard
to
the
first
position
at
makowiec
the
reader
will
observe
on
examining
the
plan
that
the
polish
forces
were
principally
engaged
in
defending
a
triangular
space
embraced
between
the
two
roads
which
lead
from
wengrow
and
kaluszyn
and
meet
behind
makowiec
this
space
over
which
small
elevations
covered
with
were
scattered
afforded
good
positions
for
artillery
as
well
as
infantry
but
the
principal
advantage
of
this
peculiarity
of
the
ground
was
that
it
concealed
the
inferiority
of
our
forces
in
this
position
the
village
of
makowiec
was
made
a
upon
our
left
wing
and
it
was
defended
by
five
companies
under
the
command
of
colonel
dombrowski
six
pieces
of
artillery
placed
in
the
rear
of
this
village
reached
with
their
fire
the
village
and
the
plain
in
front
of
it
the
russian
position
was
an
open
plain
illustration
makowiec
illustration
the
enemy
commenced
by
an
attack
upon
the
two
roads
from
wengrow
and
kaluszyn
and
as
the
attack
was
met
with
a
strong
resistance
he
began
to
deploy
upon
the
plain
between
the
two
roads
and
to
take
order
of
battle
nearly
russians
with
fifty
or
sixty
pieces
of
cannon
in
a
short
time
were
seen
upon
that
plain
and
commenced
a
terrible
fire
of
artillery
and
musquetry
along
their
whole
line
directed
principally
against
the
village
and
the
wooded
ground
several
battalions
in
column
attempted
an
attack
upon
these
points
those
attacks
were
witnessed
by
colonels
dombrowski
and
boguslawski
with
perfect
indifference
they
even
ordered
our
artillery
not
to
fire
our
tirailleurs
and
all
the
infantry
in
that
position
formed
themselves
into
detached
columns
of
half
battalions
and
the
russian
columns
approached
our
artillery
then
commenced
a
fire
of
grape
and
this
fire
was
a
signal
for
our
columns
with
the
brave
colonels
boguslawski
and
dombrowski
at
their
head
to
leave
their
cover
and
to
throw
themselves
upon
the
enemy
the
regiment
immortalized
itself
in
that
attack
one
of
its
columns
threw
itself
upon
three
of
the
enemy
the
fire
ceased
and
a
terrible
carnage
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
commenced
the
enemy
repeatedly
renewed
his
attacking
force
but
he
found
it
impossible
to
move
our
position
at
about
having
suffered
so
much
from
loss
and
exhaustion
he
discontinued
the
attack
general
skrzynecki
profiting
by
the
cessation
of
the
fire
took
the
opportunity
to
pass
the
liwiec
and
ordered
a
light
fire
of
tirailleurs
to
be
kept
up
under
cover
of
which
his
columns
commenced
executing
the
passage
when
the
greater
part
of
the
corps
had
passed
the
tirailleurs
began
to
make
a
retrograde
movement
and
were
undisturbed
by
the
enemy
six
squadrons
of
cavalry
left
as
a
rear
guard
protected
the
passage
of
the
river
by
the
light
troops
in
this
manner
the
position
was
slowly
evacuated
the
bridge
destroyed
and
by
about
two
the
whole
corps
were
on
the
march
for
dobre
the
six
squadrons
abovenamed
to
which
were
added
nine
pieces
of
light
artillery
prevented
for
a
long
while
the
reconstruction
of
the
bridge
by
the
enemy
and
did
not
quit
their
position
until
the
corps
was
at
a
safe
distance
after
which
they
followed
rapidly
and
overtook
the
corps
at
about
four
and
with
it
took
position
in
order
of
battle
near
dobre
battle
of
dobre
the
position
of
dobre
was
more
advantageous
for
us
than
the
former
it
was
protected
in
front
by
two
ponds
of
considerable
size
which
lost
themselves
at
their
extremities
in
marshy
ground
the
only
passage
which
led
between
those
two
ponds
was
easy
of
defence
and
general
skrzynecki
posted
upon
it
twelve
pieces
of
artillery
of
large
calibre
the
remaining
part
of
this
position
was
like
the
former
covered
with
scattered
clumps
of
the
principal
circumstance
however
which
made
this
position
eligible
was
the
declivity
of
the
ground
inclining
towards
the
marshy
ponds
above
mentioned
general
skrzynecki
collected
all
his
cavalry
upon
his
right
wing
to
hinder
the
enemy
from
gaining
the
road
that
leads
to
minsk
a
the
left
of
his
position
b
he
laid
open
to
the
enemy
the
position
in
that
direction
was
surrounded
by
marshes
upon
which
if
the
enemy
should
advance
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
extricate
himself
without
being
exposed
to
fight
on
the
most
disadvantageous
terms
on
this
oblique
front
general
skrzynecki
awaited
the
approach
of
the
russian
force
in
about
half
an
hour
after
our
position
was
taken
the
enemy
arrived
and
began
to
debouch
between
the
two
ponds
which
he
was
allowed
to
do
under
a
very
light
fire
of
our
artillery
every
manoeuvre
however
upon
our
right
was
met
with
desperate
charges
of
the
bayonet
and
the
fire
of
our
whole
artillery
all
his
attempts
in
that
quarter
were
ineffectual
in
the
repulses
of
these
attacks
two
of
our
bravest
colonels
boguslawski
commander
of
the
regiment
of
infantry
and
ziemiecki
commander
of
the
regiment
of
hulans
the
former
fighting
on
foot
with
his
carbine
in
his
hand
at
the
head
of
his
regiment
were
severely
wounded
at
last
after
these
ineffectual
attempts
on
our
right
the
enemy
fell
into
the
plans
of
general
skrzynecki
and
began
to
act
on
our
left
when
our
commander
hastened
to
take
all
the
advantage
of
the
situation
in
which
the
enemy
were
about
to
expose
themselves
that
the
lateness
of
the
day
permitted
general
skrzynecki
passed
down
the
front
of
our
line
and
addressed
the
soldiers
in
a
few
animating
words
to
prepare
them
to
make
a
general
attack
on
the
enemy
our
forces
were
divided
into
two
parts
the
smaller
of
which
occupied
by
their
attack
the
main
body
of
the
enemy
while
the
larger
threw
itself
upon
the
enemy
right
wing
which
was
at
some
distance
from
the
rest
of
his
forces
and
was
apparently
intending
to
act
on
our
right
wing
and
to
turn
it
in
a
moment
this
body
of
the
enemy
force
was
completely
broken
up
the
fury
of
the
attack
was
such
that
some
russian
battalions
were
entirely
destroyed
it
was
only
the
near
approach
of
night
and
the
inadequacy
of
our
force
for
a
pursuit
which
saved
the
whole
of
the
enemy
corps
from
destruction
for
his
entire
right
wing
took
to
flight
and
a
general
consternation
ensued
the
enemy
lost
on
that
day
according
to
his
own
reports
more
than
men
in
killed
wounded
and
prisoners
on
our
side
the
loss
amounted
to
about
thus
ended
the
memorable
battle
of

night
approached
at
okuniew
the
road
passes
a
marshy
forest
for
more
than
half
a
mile
the
enemy
was
imprudent
enough
to
push
his
columns
upon
this
road
general
skrzynecki
awaited
them
at
a
point
not
far
distant
on
the
opposite
side
the
advanced
guard

imprudently
composed
of
several
regiments
of
cossack
cavalry
had
already
passed
the
dyke
when
the
regiment
threw
themselves
in
columns
upon
them
these
forces
of
the
enemy
were
thrown
into
the
utmost
consternation
their
only
escape
was
into
the
marshes
on
either
side
where
some
hundreds
of
them
were
taken
prisoners
without
resistance
the
arrival
of
the
night
terminated
the
scene
and
saved
this
advanced
guard
of
the
enemy
from
total
destruction
thus
ended
a
sanguinary
day
on
which
in
every
part
of
our
line
our
troops
were
victorious
and
the
enemy
was
subjected
to
immense
losses
our
generals
had
made
the
best
choice
of
their
positions
and
had
profited
by
them
to
the
utmost
the
enemy
loss
on
that
day
in
killed
wounded
and
prisoners
amounted
to
at
least
men
on
our
side
the
loss
did
not
exceed
on
the
night
of
the
our
army
took
the
following
position
vii
our
left
wing
was
between
jablonna
and
zombki
and
sent
out
its
reconnoisances
as
far
as
zagroby
upon
the
narew
n
the
bridge
over
which
at
that
place
they
destroyed
our
centre
was
between
okuniew
and
zombki
our
right
wing
was
at
wavre
after
two
such
bloody
days
as
the
preceding
had
been
for
the
russians
we
can
not
sufficiently
express
our
astonishment
that
marshal
diebitsch
should
have
allowed
his
army
no
repose
but
should
have
again
pushed
his
attack
without
any
new
plan
on
the
and
these
operations
of
diebitsch
without
an
assignable
end
indicated
a
blind
confidence
in
numbers
or
the
headlong
fury
of
a
man
inflamed
by
the
renown
which
he
had
acquired
and
who
was
determined
to
make
the
event
bear
out
as
nearly
as
possible
whatever
sacrifice
it
might
cost
the
rash
boast
which
he
is
said
to
have
made
that
he
would
finish
the
war
in
hours
but
he
sacrificed
his
thousands
in
vain
on
the
an
action
took
place
not
only
with
the
grand
army
under
the
walls
of
warsaw
or
on
the
fields
of
praga
but
also
on
the
left
bank
of
the
vistula
at
swierza
vi
forty
miles
from
warsaw
where
general
dwernicki
beat
prince
wirtemberg
who
as
we
have
already
mentioned
had
passed
the
vistula
at
pulawa

and
was
approaching

viii
ix
at
the
break
of
day
upon
every
point
the
right
wing
the
centre
and
the
left
wing
our
line
was
attacked
we
might
remark
in
regard
to
the
positions
of
the
two
armies
on
that
day
that
our
right
wing
a
which
was
at
wavre
was
unprotected
while
on
the
other
hand
the
left
wing
c
of
the
enemy
opposite
to
it
was
very
advantageously
placed
on
heights
covered
with
wood
between
milosna
and
wavre
our
centre
b
was
better
posted
at
kawenzyn
it
occupied
this
village
which
was
in
a
commanding
position
and
the
declivity
descending
from
it
to
the
plain
of
zombki
our
left
wing
at
bialolenka
was
also
advantageously
covered
by
little
wooded
hills
having
two
dykes
in
front
leading
toward
them
the
russians
on
that
day
directed
their
strongest
attack
upon
our
right
wing
which
occupied
the
weakest
position
with
the
view
of
carrying
this
position
they
sent
against
it
some
forty
battalions
of
infantry
and
some
thirty
squadrons
of
cavalry
supported
by
seventy
pieces
of
artillery
our
position
was
defended
by
a
division
of
about
ten
battalions
of
infantry
and
fifteen
squadrons
of
artillery
supported
by
pieces
of
artillery
this
enormous
disproportion
did
not
discourage
our
soldiers
their
energy
supplied
the
place
of
numbers
the
enemy
commenced
his
attack
by
a
warm
fire
of
light
troops
and
a
fire
from
his
artillery
which
commanded
the
plain
the
skilful
manoeuvres
of
general
zimirski
in
displaying
his
front
contracting
it
dividing
it
into
small
parties
and
withdrawing
or
advancing
as
the
direction
of
the
enemy
artillery
required
and
thus
avoiding
the
effect
of
his
fire
prevented
the
loss
which
it
would
else
have
occasioned
in
this
way
several
hours
were
occupied
when
the
enemy
trusting
to
the
impression
which
he
supposed
his
fire
to
have
made
at
about
ten
sent
forward
twelve
or
more
battalions
d
to
the
charge
general
zimirski
anticipating
this
movement
withdrew
in
order
to
lead
them
on
to
the
plain
between
wavre
and
grokow
sending
to
general
skrzynecki
an
to
inform
him
of
this
manoeuvre
and
to
engage
him
to
send
a
force
of
cavalry
to
act
upon
the
columns
in
flank
general
skrzynecki
who
occupied
as
we
have
stated
the
heights
of
kawenzyn
was
also
warmly
engaged
with
a
brigade
of
the
enemy
and
had
already
observed
this
imprudent
advance
of
the
enemy
in
his
attack
who
had
indeed
gone
beyond
the
line
of
position
in
a
moment
the
order
was
given
for
the
brigade
of
general
kicki
to
throw
themselves
upon
the
enemy
flank
and
as
general
kicki
approached
with
the
ten
squadrons
e
which
composed
his
command
general
zimirski
gave
orders
for
a
general
charge
both
upon
the
cavalry
f
and
infantry
d
the
columns
of
the
enemy
were
carried
away
before
these
charges
and
their
attack
was
wholly
paralyzed
this
onset
which
was
so
successfully
made
forced
the
enemy
h
to
incline
his
position
back
from
kawenzyn
to
milosna
that
manoeuvre
was
decisive
of
the
enemy
fate
and
it
was
well
understood
by
our
generals
general
skrzynecki
by
pushing
forward
the
left
of
his
division
cut
off
the
right
wing
of
the
enemy
from
all
communication
with
his
centre
and
at
about
our
right
wing
and
centre
occupied
their
former
position
at
wavre
including
the
small
forest
of
elders
which
was
between
the
enemy
left
wing
and
centre
and
in
fact
general
skrzynecki
occupied
a
part
also
of
the
great
forest
this
state
of
things
was
to
be
profited
by
and
the
right
wing
of
the
enemy
thus
separated
was
to
be
attacked
before
the
enemy
should
be
able
to
renew
his
attack
upon
kawenzyn
and
the
forest
of
elders
and
our
right
wing
to
execute
this
plan
the
two
divisions
of
krukowiecki
and
szembek
composing
our
left
wing
which
was
fighting
at
bialolenka
ix
received
orders
to
push
a
strong
attack
against
the
enemy
front
at
the
same
moment
that
a
brigade
b
of
division
supported
by
some
pieces
of
cannon
operated
upon
the
road
leading
from
kawenzyn
to
zombki
by
this
manoeuvre
the
enemy
was
menaced
with
being
taken
in
the
rear
the
left
wing
as
we
have
said
was
warmly
engaged
with
the
superior
force
of
the
russians
who
by
placing
some
fifty
pieces
of
cannon
behind
the
two
dykes
above
named
kept
up
a
sweeping
fire
of
grape
upon
our
artillery
and
infantry
which
were
defending
the
passage
of
the
dykes
a
considerable
body
of
the
enemy
had
already
reached
the
hither
side
of
the
dykes
when
general
uminski
with
a
brigade
of
cavalry
d
advanced
to
the
charge
and
at
the
same
time
communicated
the
orders
to
the
two
divisions
to
commence
the
general
attack
under
a
warm
fire
of
grape
our
cavalry
threw
themselves
upon
the
enemy
infantry

had
debouched
over
the
dykes
a
general
charge
commenced

our
cavalry
penetrated
the
enemy

and
regiments
of
chasseurs

themselves
by
their
feats
of
bravery
the
enemy

repulsed
and
began
to
fall
back
and
crowd
upon
the
dykes
and
at
this
moment
their
rout
was
effected
a
brigade
b
from
general
skrzynecki
division
arrived
and
commenced
a
fire
of
grape
upon
the
dykes
over
which
the
enemy
was
flying
in
the
greatest
disorder
their
ranks
were
in
the
utmost
confusion
they
crowded
with
precipitation
upon
the
dykes
exposed
continually
to
our
destructive
fire
by
this
repulse
the
whole
of
the
enemy
right
wing
was
broken
and
they
commenced
a
general
retreat
leaving
a
great
number
of
prisoners
who
either
had
not
reached
the
dykes
or
could
not
get
from
them
amounting
to
perhaps
a
thousand
men

another

to
have
ended
here
towards
night
the

renewed
his
attacks
upon
our

were
feeble

enemy
on
that
day
x
by
continual
charges
of
cavalry
in
which
the
krakus
of
krakowie
were
particularly
distinguished
his
only
plan
upon
that
day
was
to
keep
the
enemy
upon
the
plain
of
ryczywol
during
the
night
he
intended
to
pass
with
the
chief
part
of
his
force
the
river
radomierza
above
ryczywol
and
by
this
course
to
present
himself
to
the
enemy
upon
the
road
which
leads
from
radom
to
ryczywol
the
same
road
in
fact
upon
which
the
enemy
had
advanced
and
attack
him
both
on
his
flank
and
rear
the
vistula
being
on
his
front
in
executing
this
movement
general
dwernicki
left
two
squadrons
of
cavalry
a
one
battalion
of
infantry
a
and
two
pieces
of
cannon
at
the
side
of
the
river
under
the
command
of
colonel
russyian
he
then
quietly
left
his
position
and
crossed
the
river
in
its
fordable
places
about
half
a
league
above
colonel
russyian
who
as
we
have
said
remained
on
the
position
at
ryczywol
was
ordered
to
commence
a
light
fire
of
skirmishers
at
break
of
day
but
to
retrograde
constantly
and
to
allow
the
enemy
an
easy
passage
over
the
bridge
on
the
the
enemy
d
who
had
no
suspicions
of
the
manoeuvre
commenced
in
the
morning
his
debouchment
upon
the
bridge
having
the
expectation
of
engaging
with
our
whole
force
in
a
decisive
battle
upon
the
field
of
ryczywol
his
astonishment
may
be
imagined
when
as
the
day
commenced
he
found
both
upon
his
flank
and
his
rear
a
force
marching
against
him
to
the
attack
b
the
enemy
stopped
passing
the
bridge
and
attempted
to
turn
and
meet
the
attack
but
this
was
not
permitted
him
our
cavalry
threw
themselves
with
impetuosity
upon
that
part
of
his
forces
which
were
attempting
to
place
themselves
in
position
and
our
artillery
which
was
boldly
brought
near
the
enemy
columns
poured
a
terribly
destructive
fire
of
grape
upon
them
the
utmost
consternation
ensued
and
a
general
and
disorderly
flight
was
commenced
in
the
direction
of
nowawies
n
to
which
place
our
corps
continued
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
r
this
day
which
may
be
called
one
of
the
most
brilliant
in
our
war
cost
the
enemy
besides
his
killed
and
wounded
two
thousand
prisoners
with
more
than
twenty
officers
four
standards
ten
pieces
of
cannon
some
hundred
horses
and
about
thirty
chests
with
ammunition
with
officers
baggage
the
prince
wirtemberg
with
the
remains
of
his
corps
retreated
by
forced
marches
to
the
small
town
of
granica
where
he
repassed
the
vistula
and
reached
pulawa
thus
by
a
single
battle
the
whole
country
on
this
side
of
the
vistula
was
cleared
of
the
presence
of
the
enemy
general
dwernicki
permitted
to
his
corps
who
were
really
much
exhausted
by
fighting
and
marching
to
repose
by
a
slow
march
as
far
as
kozienice
where
he
remained
stationary
sending
out
however
his
reconnoisances
as
far
as
pulawa
on
the
of
february
our
main
army
was
engaged
with
the
enemy
the
whole
day
upon
the
same
position
as
on
the
preceding
this
repetition
of
his
attack
without
a
change
of
plan
or
position
was
a
great
weakness
in
the
enemy
on
that
day
feeling
sensibly
the
loss
of
a
part
of
the
great
forest
opposite
kawenzyn
as
well
as
that
of
the
small
forest
of
elders
the
enemy
commenced
his
attack
upon
those
points
some
twenty
battalions
were
incessantly
pushed
forward
to
the
attack
against
which
eight
battalions
on
our
part
kept
an
effectual
stand
for
several
hours
this
day
although
uninteresting
and
indecisive
in
manoeuvres
was
bloody
no
important
blow
was
attempted
by
us
but
every
attack
of
the
enemy
was
met
with
a
vigorous
and
sanguinary
repulse
it
was
a
day
of
glory
for
the
regiment
the
day
on
which
that
celebrated
regiment
though
already
distinguished
began
to
take
its
high
place
in
our
reports
and
on
which
it
fought
with
a
degree
of
valor
that
could
never
have
been
surpassed
without
even
waiting
for
orders
this
brave
regiment
was
seen
constantly
pushing
itself
towards
the
points
of
the
greatest
danger
and
its
companies
were
often
fighting
singly
in
the
very
midst
of
the
thickest
masses
of
the
enemy
by
the
unsuccessful
and
costly
attacks
of
the
enemy
the
whole
day
was
occupied
and
at
its
close
after
the
loss
of
thousands
of
men
he
had
not
gained
a
foot
of
ground
thus
ten
days
had
passed
in
continual
and
bloody
actions
upon
the
same
position
during
which
the
polish
army
had
been
uniformly
successful
and
at
the
end
of
which
the
enemy
discontinued
his
attacks
thus
giving
the
most
convincing
proof
of
the
extent
of
the
losses
he
had
suffered
on
all
points
during
that
period
amounting
in
fact
in
killed
wounded
and
prisoners
to
full
men
in
this
space
of
ten
days
the
whole
russian
army
had
been
engaged
and
that
army
amounted
as
we
have
already
said
and
as
will
be
confirmed
by
all
the
official
reports
to
more
than
infantry
cavalry
and
pieces
of
cannon
to
this
force
was
opposed
a
handful
comparatively
of
poles
consisting
of
infantry
cavalry
and
pieces
of
cannon
a
sixth
part
in
fact
of
the
russian
force
this
memorable
commencement
of
our
war
will
show
to
the
world
what
can
be
effected
by
a
nation
fighting
in
defence
of
its
liberty
and
to
throw
off
an
oppressive
yoke
those
bloody
combats
and
that
enthusiasm
to
which
my
feeble
pen
can
not
render
justice
but
which
some
better
historian
will
present
to
the
world
in
their
true
colors
should
convince
men
that
the
immense
mercenary
forces
which
a
despot
may
lead
on
and
by
which
he
trusts
to
enforce
his
will
may
avail
him
little
his
enormous
masses
are
like
a
heap
of
sand
which
a
little
stone
can
pierce
without
animating
motives
and
therefore
without
energy
a
machine
scarcely
to
be
trusted
that
army
itself
upon
the
slightest
change
of
circumstances
may
become
terrible
to
the
despot
of
whom
and
of
whose
creatures
it
was
to
have
been
made
the
unhappy
sacrifice
the
reader
will
pardon
me
if
i
fatigue
him
with
farther
reflections
upon
this
stage
of
our
affairs
i
shall
not
exaggerate
in
saying
that
this
enormous
mass
of
the
enemy
forces
would
in
an
equal
period
have
been
absolutely
annihilated
if
we
had
then
had
a
commander
in
chief
of
greater
talent
and
a
general
plan
of
operation
differently
arranged
for
the
different
operations
in
detail
were
generally
speaking
perfectly
executed
the
commander
in
chief
prince
radzivil
was
an
individual
of
the
most
estimable
character
but
as
he
afterwards
himself
avowed
not
possessed
of
military
talent
general
chlopicki
who
was
always
near
him
and
who
in
fact
virtually
commanded
if
he
had
in
the
early
part
of
his
life
exhibited
military
talent
in
his
present
advanced
age
had
certainly
lost
much
of
his
energy
and
was
unfit
to
undertake
things
which
demanded
the
most
active
intellect
and
the
most
absolute
devotedness
of
mind
and
body
to
the
cause
we
can
not
too
strongly
express
our
astonishment
that
general
chlopicki
who
had
formed
the
plan
and
a
very
judicious
one
it
was
of
drawing
the
enemy
on
to
the
walls
of
warsaw
to
give
him
there
a
decisive
battle
should
have
neglected
to
fortify
the
natural
positions
upon
his
route
by
which
the
enemy
loss
would
have
been
doubled
or
even
trebled
serock
and
zagroby
vi
situated
upon
points
of
the
greatest
importance
especially
the
first
were
evacuated
by
our
forces
for
the
want
of
proper
defences
not
the
slightest
fortification
was
constructed
at
the
different
passages
of
the
narew
n
the
bug
b
the
liewiec
l
and
the
swider
s
nor
upon
the
region
between
those
rivers
which
was
full
of
forests
and
impenetrable
marshes
and
in
which
proper
fortifications
would
have
presented
the
most
important
obstructions
to
the
enemy
passage
no
concealed
passages
or
through
those
forests
were
constructed
as
they
should
have
been
by
which
a
body
of
troops
could
be
led
in
ambuscade
and
brought
to
act
suddenly
on
the
enemy
flanks
or
otherwise
in
critical
moments
and
with
decisive
effect
such
works
would
have
required
but
little
expense
and
could
have
been
made
by
the
jewish
inhabitants
of
whom
there
are
some
millions
in
poland
twenty
thousand
in
warsaw
alone
and
who
could
have
no
claims
for
exemption
for
they
render
no
service
to
the
country
but
on
the
contrary
lead
a
life
of
profitable
fraud
and
deception
practised
upon
the
inhabitants
the
jews
indeed
with
some
very
few
exceptions
did
not
in
the
least
aid
in
the
war
but
often
frustrated
our
exertions
by
their
espionage
and
there
are
in
fact
instances
of
their
having
fought
against
us
against
those
who
had
given
them
an
asylum
upon
their
soil
in
the
towns
of
nasielsk
and
makow
this
occurred
this
part
of
our
population
who
had
an
equal
interest
with
us
in
the
protection
of
the
country
as
far
as
property
was
concerned
could
have
been
thus
employed
with
perfect
justice
and
propriety
if
by
such
arrangements
a
system
of
fortification
had
been
properly
united
with
tactics
and
all
the
plans
directed
by
a
man
of
talents
and
energy
of
which
examples
were
certainly
to
be
found
in
our
ranks
with
such
troops
to
command
the
reader
will
admit
that
the
russian
forces
could
have
been
soon
driven
back
to
the
frontiers
the
succession
of
victories
which
we
have
described
were
not
the
results
of
any
general
system
they
were
victories
of
detail
executed
with
energy
and
rapidity
and
for
which
we
were
indebted
to
the
generals
of
divisions
and
brigades
the
colonels
of
regiments
these
successes
were
isolated
but
had
they
been
made
to
bear
upon
each
other
their
advantages
would
have
been
much
greater
for
example
the
battle
of
dobre
which
was
so
brilliantly
gained
by
skrzynecki
would
have
caused
the
total
ruin
of
the
corps
opposed
to
him
if
the
division
of
krukowiecki
which
was
in
the
environs
of
jadow
had
come
to
the
aid
of
skrzynecki
during
that
action
and
indeed
this
was
the
expectation
of
skrzynecki
when
he
remained
so
long
upon
the
position
of
makowiec
but
this
division
instead
of
acting
upon
the
rear
of
the
enemy
as
it
might
have
done
having
no
orders
to
this
effect
continued
its
retrograde
march
although
within
the
sound
of
the
cannon
of
that
action
on
the
there
was
not
enough
of
harmony
in
the
operations
of
the
several
divisions
on
that
day
if
those
operations
had
been
directed
from
one
point
as
from
a
centre
the
enemy
who
had
been
guilty
of
extreme
imprudence
in
the
advance
which
he
had
made
into
the
marshy
and
wooded
region
between
stanislawow
okuniew
and
the
great
road
could
have
been
completely
hedged
in

the
manoeuvres
of
general
zimirski
when
the
enemy
made
his
rapid
attack
on
the
morning
of

executed
at
hazard
no
general
order
having
been
given
in
anticipation
of
such
an
attack
these
manoeuvres
were
well
executed
by
general
zimirski
but
if
the
case
had
been
thus
anticipated
by
the
commander
in
chief
and
at
the
commencement
of
the
action
our
right
wing
had
been
withdrawn
to
grochow
a
viii
an
obstinate
defence
of
the
commanding
position
of
kawenzyn
b
being
kept
up
and
the
enemy
had
been
thus
allowed
to
follow
our
right
wing
with
his
left
by
the
same
method
of
operation
which
was
in
fact
executed
by
skrzynecki
and
zimirski
in
concert
but
with
much
larger
forces
the
enemy
could
have
been
attacked
on
his
flank
and
instead
of
the
annihilation
of
his
sixteen
battalions
the
same
fate
would
have
attended
twice
or
thrice
that
number
for
when
a
force
is
taken
by
surprise
in
flank
and
rear
numbers
avail
comparatively
little
in
resistance
indeed
the
greater
the
number
the
greater
is
the
difficulty
of
changing
position
and
the
greater
the
disorder
and
consternation
which
follows
the
russian
army
was
thus
early
inspired
with
terror
at
the
resistance
which
it
had
experienced
and
the
immense
losses
to
which
it
had
been
subjected
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
to
profit
by
this
consternation
but
the
vast
advantages
which
might
have
been
gained
under
such
circumstances
by
some
general
plan
of
offensive
operations
of
bold
and
decisive
character
were
let
pass
footnotes
footnote
i
can
not
pass
over
this
occasion
of
describing
the
manner
in
which
the
nation
received
that
army
which
had
but
a
month
before
left
the
walls
of
warsaw
and
had
after
so
many
glorious
actions
returned
to
give
there
a
decisive
battle
to
the
enemy
and
to
fall
or
conquer
there
before
the
eyes
of
the
nation
those
were
moments
rare
in
history
and
should
be
handed
down
to
posterity
to
demonstrate
to
what
a
height
the
feelings
of
the
nation
were
exalted
and
what
a
unanimity
was
felt
in
the
great
cause
that
warmed
all
hearts
the
thunder
of
the
cannon
which
during
the
rolled
over
the
fields
of
milosna
and
okuniew
was
heard
at
warsaw
and
announced
the
approach
of
the
army
at
nightfall
when
our
first
detachments
began
to
show
themselves
from
the
forests
of
milosna
and
jablonna
and
to
deploy
upon
the
plains
of
wavre
and
bialolenka
the
whole
population
of
warsaw
began
to
leave
the
city
and
go
forth
to
meet
and
hail
their
defenders
the
senate
whose
estimable
president
czartoriski
was
with
the
army
left
the
city
also
in
a
short
time
the
fields
were
covered
with
an
exulting
multitude
when
the
army
took
its
position
and
all
was
quiet
under
the
protection
of
night
the
people
drew
near
and
entered
the
camp
what
a
touching
scene
was
there
presented
here
a
father
and
mother
seek
their
son
who
meeting
them
presses
them
to
his
bosom
there
a
wife
leading
her
children
finds
her
husband
and
their
father
and
throws
herself
into
his
arms
while
the
children
cling
around
the
knees
of
their
delighted
parents
a
melancholy
contrast
was
presented
by
those
who
sought
in
vain
for
son
husband
parent
but
no
complaint
was
heard
the
tears
falling
for
those
who
were
no
more
were
checked
by
the
thought
that
they
had
died
for
their
country
the
senate
in
the
name
of
the
nation
and
in
the
most
touching
language
thanked
the
commander
in
chief
and
his
officers
for
the
services
which
they
had
rendered
to
their
country
and
requested
them
to
communicate
these
sentiments
to
the
whole
army
they
finished
their
address
in
nearly
the
following
terms
brave
compatriots
this
noble
energy
and
in
a
short
time
the
throne
of
despotism
will
fall
and
upon
its
ruins
civilization
and
public
happiness
will
rise
the
people
continued
with
the
army
furnishing
them
with
every
comfort
and
regardless
of
the
fire
which
was
commenced
the
next
day
from
the
enemy
artillery
under
this
fire
vehicles
with
provisions
and
ammunition
were
continually
arriving
from
the
city
and
some
of
them
were
destroyed
by
the
enemy
shot
during
the
actions
before
warsaw
the
inhabitants
made
it
a
duty
to
be
at
hand
to
bear
off
and
succor
the
wounded
and
among
those
who
engaged
in
these
offices
were
some
of
the
most
distinguished
ladies
of
warsaw
the
strangers
who
were
then
there
and
who
witnessed
the
enthusiasm
which
animated
the
people
and
seemed
to
unite
them
into
one
family
exclaimed
that
such
a
nation
could
never
and
ought
never
be
conquered
the
following
days
the
and
of
february
in
which
no
action
took
place
were
devoted
to
thanksgiving
to
god
for
his
favor
in
protecting
the
polish
cause
thus
far
in
all
the
churches
the
people
assembled
to
offer
prayers
for
the
welfare
of
the
country
and
the
army
employed
this
period
of
repose
in
the
same
manner
on
that
field
over
which
the
three
hundred
cannon
of
the
enemy
were
pointed
in
battle
array
while
the
first
line
was
in
position
the
rest
of
the
army
were
engaged
in
these
devotional
exercises
at
each
assemblage
of
troops
the
ministers
of
religion
administered
patriotic
oaths
and
animated
the
soldiers
to
perseverance
in
the
holy
struggle
those
sacred
ceremonies
were
followed
by
hymns
which
were
sung
along
the
whole
line
and
which
mingling
with
the
solemn
sounds
of
the
bells
of
warsaw
tolling
for
the
assembly
of
the
people
in
the
churches
produced
an
indescribably
impressive
effect
these
exercises
ended
in
the
general
shout
of
forever
to
convince
the
russians
that
the
poles
were
not
blindly
fighting
against
them
as
russians
but
for
that
cause
of
civilization
and
happiness
which
was
of
equal
moment
to
themselves
several
hundred
white
flags
were
prepared
with
inscriptions
in
the
russian
language
in
terms
such
as
follows
brother
sarmatians
we
march
to
combat
not
as
your
enemies
but
to
fight
for
your
welfare
as
well
as
our
own
each
regiment
received
from
ten
to
twenty
of
those
flags
which
during
the
combat
were
to
be
distributed
among
the
tirailleurs
and
flankers
they
were
directed
to
throw
them
as
occasion
might
offer
among
the
russian
ranks
many
of
those
volunteers
in
rushing
forward
to
plant
those
flags
among
the
russian
skirmishers
met
their
death
at
the
hands
of
those
whom
they
wished
to
save
from
tyranny
thus
the
poles
had
done
all
that
their
duty
required
of
them
in
this
holy
contest
to
convince
the
world
that
the
general
cause
of
civilization
and
happiness
was
the
great
end
of
their
struggle
they
sought
not
their
own
aggrandizement
by
conquests
from
the
territory
of
another
nation
for
their
ancient
boundaries
are
wide
enough
for
them
they
fought
for
that
liberty
which
they
had
for
ages
possessed
and
that
ancient
liberty
and
those
ancient
limits

the

who

dwernicki
was

had
served
in
the

army
as
he
was
cousin
to
the
present
king
of
wirtemberg
and
nephew
of
the
late
emperor

this
prince
commanded

regiment
of
hulans
of
the
first
of
which
regiments
general
dwernicki
was
colonel
in
this
way
the
prince
was
perfectly
well
known
to
general
dwernicki
and
was
held
by
him
in
very
low
esteem
as
a
man
of
vanity
and
pretension
and
a
tyrant
over
his
subalterns
the
vices
of
his
character
developed
themselves
sufficiently
during
our
revolution
at
the
breaking
out
of
the
revolution
at
warsaw
this
man
was
at
a
small
town
in
the
palatinate
of
lublin
in
which
his
brigade
was
posted
on
the
arrival
of
the
news
of
the
revolution
his
first
care
was
to
secrete
himself
afterwards
finding
that
it
was
impossible
to
keep
concealed
he
began
to
tamper
with
the
brigade
and
tried
to
persuade
his
soldiers
to
adhere
to
the
service
of
the
grand
duke
and
to
refuse
to
join
the
cause
of
their
country
these
false
persuasions
coming
from
him
a
general
in
the
polish
service
in
open
defiance
of
the
will
of
the
nation
and
in
opposition
to
its
holiest
efforts
afforded
a
sufficient
ground
of
accusation
against
him
to
have
brought
him
to
judgment
as
a
traitor
besides
all
this
by
his
tyrannic
conduct
as
a
general
he
had
deserved
severe
treatment
but
all
these
offences
were
forgotten
and
the
nation
spared
him
merely
ordering
him
to
quit
the
country
he
exhibited
his
gratitude
for
this
delicate
treatment
by
departing
for
russia
and
the
polish
provinces
and
pointing
out
for
arrest
some
of
the
most
respectable
citizens
who
were
known
for
their
patriotic
sentiments
he
passed
several
days
at
wlodawa
a
small
frontier
town
between
the
polish
kingdom
and
the
government
of
grodno
there
he
was
guilty
of
the
mean
act
of
intercepting
the
correspondence
between
the
different
patriotic
individuals
this
was
not
enough
in
the
campaign
he
took
the
command
of
a
russian
corps
destined
to
act
in
the
very
palatinate
of
lublin
where
he
had
held
his
polish
command
for
fourteen
years
and
where
all
the
proprietors
had
treated
him
with
the
greatest
kindness
and
delicacy
arriving
there
with
his
corps
he
left
at
every
step
the
traces
of
his
tyranny
on
reaching
pulawa
the
estate
of
the
beloved
czartoriski
the
president
of
the
national
government
the
residence
of
that
family
from
which
he
had
himself
received
so
many
kindnesses
and
in
which
every
virtue
reigned
he
did
not
scruple
to
give
orders
to
burn
the
town
he
did
not
scruple
to
take
the
name
in
history
of
devastator
of

of
that
beautiful
spot
on
which
the
labor
of
ages
had
been
expended
and
which
was
so
celebrated
for
the
charms
with
which
nature
as
well
as
art
had
enriched
it
his
cruelties
were
carried
to
such
a
height
that
he
actually
caused
to
be
beaten
with
the
knout
a
young
lady
a
friend
of
the
princess
czartoriski
who
had
manifested
her
patriotic
sentiments
by
the
sacrifice
of
her
jewels
to
aid
the
cause
of
her
country
even
the
princess
czartoriski
who
was
already
at
an
advanced
age
was
not
spared
the
insults
of
this
gross
man
who
to
put
the
finishing
stroke
to
his
barbarity
on
his
second
visit
to
pulawa
directed
a
fire
of
artillery
upon
the
palace
which
he
knew
was
occupied
only
by
the
princess
and
her
ladies
even
the
russians
themselves
regarded
these
actions
with
abhorrence
in
regard
to
his
military
talents
they
were
of
the
lowest
order
general

of

by
designating

for

many
of

contributed

for
that

was
to

from

received
also
the
attention
of
the
government
when
after
so
many
battles
the
russian
commander
discontinued
his
attacks
it
may
be
supposed
that
besides
the
repose
which
his
army
required
he
had
another
object
viz
to
wait
the
arrival
of
new
corps
consisting
of
men
and
pieces
of
cannon
under
prince
sczachowski
he
evidently
wished
to
concentrate
all
his
small
detachments
and
all
his
reserves
in
order
to
strike
with
his
whole
force
a
decisive
blow
and
the
attempt
was
in
fact
soon
made
our
army
which
in
the
ten
preceding
days
had
lost
about
six
thousand
men
was
reinforced
by
three
regiments
armed
with
pitchforks
amounting
to
about
the
number
we
had
lost
our
whole
army
infantry
and
cavalry
may
have
amounted
to
men
and
with
the
pieces
taken
from
the
enemy
the
russian
army
with
the
new
corps
of
sczachowski
amounted
to
men
and
pieces
of
cannon
deducting
the
artillery
which
had
been
lost
or
dismounted
marshal
diebitsch
before
commencing
hostile
operations
opened
negotiations
and
for
this
purpose
sent
a
general
of
division
witt
with
a
flag
of
truce
to
our
this
general
was
stopped
at
our
advanced
post
whither
general
krukowiecki
was
sent
by
the
commander
in
chief
with
full
powers
to
meet
him
general
witt
commenced
with
expressions
of
the
greatest
sensibility
and
enlarged
much
upon
the
friendship
which
ought
to
exist
between
the
poles
and
the
russians
as
brother
nations
he
then
spoke
in
very
flattering
terms
of
the
heroism
of
the
poles
lamenting
that
it
was
not
displayed
in
a
better
cause
after
much
complimentary
language
he
insensibly
passed
to
the
ideas
of
duty
and
obedience
to
the
monarch
general
krukowiecki
who
understood
perfectly
well
all
these
professions
which
he
knew
to
be
insidious
answered
nearly
in
the
following
laconic
terms
after
the
sad
circumstances
which
have
taken
place
after
the
bloody
combats
to
which
we
have
been
forced
by
the
tyranny
of
fifteen
years
by
the
refusal
of
justice
and
in
fine
by
the
violation
of
our
frontier
and
the
laying
waste
of
our
territory
upon
this
territory
we
can
make
no
arrangements
you
know
well
what
are
the
frontiers
of
poland
upon
the
banks
of
the
dnieper
four
hundred
miles
hence
we
may
enter
into
negotiations
thus
all
was
ready
for
the
sanguinary
battle
of
two
days
which
followed
and
one
memorable
in
the
annals
of
war
it
commenced
by
a
combat
on
the
at
bialolenka
and
ended
on
the
on
the
plain
of
grochow
position
on
the
and
battle
of
bialolenka
the
position
of
the
two
armies
on
the
was
as
follows
the
polish
army
occupied
the
same
ground
as
when
they
ceased
firing
on
the
but
the
force
was
disposed
in
a
different
the
right
wing
was
reinforced
by
the
division
of
general
szembek
and
although
bialolenka
kawenzyn
and
wavre
composed
the
line
of
combat
there
was
this
difference
that
while
before
the
centre
was
at
kawenzyn
and
the
left
wing
at
bialolenka
at
present
the
left
wing
was
at
kawenzyn
the
forces
which
were
at
bialolenka
were
posted
as
a
detached
corps
and
the
centre
of
the
army
was
at
the
forest
of
elders
the
right
wing
occupied
the
space
between
the
great
road
and
the
marshes
of
the
vistula
called
the
marshes
of
goclaw
this
arrangement
made
our
line
more
concentrated
the
first
division
under
krukowiecki
which
was
at
bialolenka
with
the
division
of
cavalry
under
uminski
was
directed
to
observe
the
great
road
from
jablonna
and
all
the
roads
leading
from
radzimin
and
zombki
to
warsaw
between
kawenzyn
and
bialolenka
the
debouchment
of
the
enemy
was
prevented
by
extensive
marshes
the
russian
army
was
upon
the
same
points
as
on
the
their
greatest
force
was
opposed
to
our
right
wing
at
wavre
on
the
afternoon
of
the
the
enemy
attacked
with
impetuosity
the
first
division
at
bialolenka
the
corps
of
the
enemy
which
made
this
attack
was
that
of
the
prince
sczachowski
which
had
recently
joined
the
main
army
and
for
which
marshal
diebitsch
was
supposed
to
have
waited
this
corps
as
was
afterwards
ascertained
had
missed
their
road
and
became
unintentionally
engaged
with
our
forces
on
that
day
the
orders
of
that
corps
were
to
traverse
the
forests
between
radzimin
and
zombki
and
to
join
the
army
without
being
observed
by
our
forces
it
was
the
false
direction
which
they
took
that
brought
on
the
engagement
at
bialolenka
this
battle
consisted
like
the
former
actions
at
this
place
of
an
attempt
by
the
enemy
to
force
the
passage
of
the
dykes
which
were
defended
on
our
side
by
about
eight
battalions
protected
by
some
twenty
pieces
of
cannon
this
small
force
repulsed
the
enemy
in
three
successive
attacks
upon
the
dykes
at
about
another
russian
corps
under
general
pahlen
came
to
the
succor
of
sczachowski
and
as
the
first
corps
attempted
to
pass
the
road
leading
from
radzimin
the
latter
attempted
to
force
the
passage
of
the
two
dykes
leading
from
zombki
and
at
both
points
under
the
cover
of
a
terrible
fire
of
artillery
if
the
reader
will
consider
that
our
small
force
consisting
of
only
eight
battalions
and
fifteen
squadrons
stood
their
ground
against
two
russian
corps
of
nearly
men
and
pieces
of
cannon
the
efforts
which
were
made
on
that
day
may
be
appreciated
our
plan
of
action
consisted
chiefly
in
allowing
a
part
of
the
forces
to
pass
the
dykes
and
then
falling
upon
and
cutting
them
up
by
successive
charges
of
cavalry
and
infantry
supported
by
an
effective
fire
of
artillery
by
such
efforts
this
handful
of
brave
men
repulsed
the
attacks
of
the
enemy
until
night
when
his
attacks
ceased
at
the
approach
of
night
general
krukowiecki
sent
small
reconnoitering
parties
upon
the
roads
from
radzimin
and
zombki
these
patrols
pushing
as
far
as
and
even
beyond
zombki
saw
nothing
of
the
enemy
and
in
fact
learnt
to
their
astonishment
from
the
marauders
whom
they
took
that
the
two
russian
corps
had
quitted
their
position
and
were
on
their
march
across
the
forest
of
kawenzyn
to
join
the
main
army
this
sudden
withdrawal
of
the
enemy
corps
was
an
indication
that
they
had
received
orders
to
join
the
grand
army
and
that
a
general
attack
was
in
contemplation
for
the
next
day
in
expectation
of
this
attack
a
body
of
men
was
sent
during
the
night
to
obstruct
by
defences
the
three
roads
leading
from
radzimin
and
zombki
small
detachments
were
left
on
those
roads

were

their

as
they
were
consisting
only
of
seven
battalions
with
twelve
pieces
of
cannon
they
had
formed
the
determination
to
die
or
conquer
upon
that
ground
they
could
hope
for
no
succor
for
the
whole
line
was
in
expectation
of
a
general
attack
the
brave
generals
krukowiecki
and
malachowski
made
every
effort
to
sustain
the
perseverance
of
their
troops
and
each
of
them
at
the
head
of
their
columns
and
on
foot
threw
themselves
upon
the
enemy
ranks
our
artillery
did
not
answer
that
of
the
russians
but
directed
its
fire
of
grape
wholly
upon
the
columns
which
were
approaching
by
the
unparalleled
bravery
of
our
wing
of
which
every
soldier
seemed
to
have
formed
the
resolution
to
fall
rather
than
yield
a
foot
of
ground
this
tremendous
attack
of
the
enemy
was
sustained
for
several
hours
till
at
last
he
was
obliged
to
slacken
it
during
the
whole
of
this
attack
upon
our
left
wing
the
centre
and
the
right
remained
still
in
their
positions
awaiting
the
expected
attack
it
was
near
ten
when
the
fields
of
wavre
became
as
it
were
in
one
moment
covered
with
the
forces
of
the
enemy
which
issued
out
of
the
cover
of
the
forests
overhanging
the
plain
looking
over
that
plain
between
the
forest
of
elders
and
the
vistula
one
would
have
thought
it
was
an
undivided
mass
of
troops
which
was
in
motion
for
in
that
comparatively
limited
space
the
eye
could
not
distinguish
the
different
divisions
from
each
other
two
hundred
pieces
of
cannon
posted
upon
that
plain
in
a
single
line
commenced
a
fire
which
made
the
earth
tremble
and
which
was
more
terrible
than
the
oldest
officers
had
ever
witnessed
after
having
prolonged
for
some
time
this
tremendous
fire
of
artillery
the
enemy
made
an
attempt
to
carry
our
right
wing
but
in
a
moment
all
our
cavalry
were
collected
there
and
fell
upon
and
overthrew
his
columns
and
his
efforts
were
as
fruitless
here
as
they
had
been
against
our
left
having
been
unsuccessful
in
these
two
attacks
on
the
wings
and
hoping
that
he
had
weakened
our
line
by
the
terrible
fire
of
artillery
which
he
constantly
kept
up
the
russian
commander
collected
the
greater
part
of
his
forces
opposite
the
forest
of
elders
and
it
was
there
that
an
attack
was
commenced
which
presented
a
scene
unheard
of
in
the
annals
of
war
it
could
with
more
propriety
be
called
a
massacre
of
nearly
four
hours
duration
the
russians
brought
together
at
this
point
one
hundred
and
twenty
pieces
of
cannon
posted
in
the
rear
and
on
the
sides
of
that
forest
some
fifty
battalions
were
incessantly
pushed
to
the
attack
with
the
view
to
get
possession
of
that
forest
had
they
been
able
to
effect
this
they
would
have
divided
our
army
into
two
parts
and
thus
could
not
but
have
ensured
its
destruction
it
was
the
consideration
of
this
important
fact
which
prompted
the
horrible
attack
and
the
desperate
resistance
which
it
met
the
brave
skrzynecki
zimirski
boguslawski
czyzewski
and
rohland
defended
this
forest
with
fourteen
battalions
whose
admirably
executed
manoeuvres
the
change
of
front
the
arrangement
of
the
attack
in
columns
and
escalon
the
concentration
of
force
upon
the
points
in
which
the
enemy
line
seemed
to
waver
a
fire
which
was
never
lost
but
was
always
reserved
for
the
closest
approach
of
the
enemy
all
were
executed
with
an
activity
order
and
coolness
never
surpassed
it
was
only
by
such
conduct
that
the
tremendous
attack
of
the
enemy
could
have
been
sustained
for
four
hours
and
that
after
having
nine
times
gained
possession
of
the
forest
he
was
as
often
repulsed
with
an
immense
loss
like
the
infantry
our
artillery
performed
prodigies
all
the
batteries
protected
by
cavalry
which
never
abandoned
them
pushed
themselves
in
advance
even
of
the
line
of
the
skirmishers
and
approached
sometimes
within
a
hundred
feet
of
the
enemy
columns
in
order
to
give
their
fire
with
the
most
infallible
execution
the
battery
of
the
brave
colonel
pientka
which
defended
the
border
of
the
forest
was
so
far
advanced
that
it
was
sometimes
surrounded
by
the
enemy
who
in
his
own
disorder
did
not
become
aware
of
the
advantage
all
the
different
operations
indeed
of
our
artillery
in
this
battle
were
truly
admirable
batteries
now
concentrated
upon
one
point
were
in
a
moment
hurried
to
another
and
distant
one
where
the
enemy
was
wholly
unprepared
for
them
and
was
thrown
into
disorder
by
their
sudden
attack
in
the
early
part
of
the
afternoon
when
the
enemy
after
having
been
several
times
repulsed
renewed
his
attack
with
the
greatest
determination
and
our
division
began
to
give
way
the
four
batteries
of
artillery
of
the
brave
adamski
maslowski
hilderbrand
and
bielak
in
concert
with
that
of
colonel
pientka
advanced
like
cavalry
to
the
charge
and
approaching
close
to
the
russian
columns
opened
a
fire
of
grape
which
spread
destruction
and
disorder
in
their
ranks
our
infantry
thus
animated
to
the
contest
rallied
and
threw
themselves
again
upon
the
enemy
who
then
yielded
before
them
like
the
artillery
and
infantry
our
cavalry
besides
the
different
charges
which
they
executed
with
so
much
bravery
was
manoeuvred
with
the
utmost
skill
by
our
generals
and
was
made
to
fill
the
voids
occasioned
by
the
inferiority
of
our
forces
so
as
always
to
present
to
the
enemy
an
unbroken
line
by
such
manoeuvres
of
the
three
arms
executed
with
the
greatest
determination
in
which
every
commander
performed
his
duty
to
the
utmost
the
enemy
plans
were
continually
disorganized
and
his
enormous
force
which
at
first
sight
would
have
been
supposed
capable
to
have
absolutely
crushed
the
small
army
opposed
to
it
was
in
effect
only
a
great
mass
making
a
continual
oscillation
and
which
seemed
to
trust
to
do
every
thing
by
a
terrible
fire
of
artillery
which
was
always
kept
up
whether
necessary
or
not
thus
it
was
that
fifty
battalions
of
the
enemy
amounting
to
over
men
supported
by
pieces
of
artillery
in
a
concentrated
attack
upon
one
point
the
forest
of
elders
the
decisive
point
of
the
position
were
nine
times
repulsed
from
that
forest
which
was
left
literally
covered
with
their
dead
from
eleven
until
three
these
attacks
continued
through
the
whole
line
the
most
powerful
being
in
the
centre
and
the
destruction
of
life
was
immense
at
the
last
named
hour
our
generals
each
of
whom
we
may
remark
had
had
their
horses
shot
under
them
and
several
of
whom
were
severely
wounded
formed
the
plan
of
giving
the
enemy
a
decisive
blow
their
plan
was
to
withdraw
from
the
fire
the
and
divisions
which
had
suffered
most
and
to
make
a
general
retrograde
movement
in
such
a
form
as
to
have
the
wings
considerably
in
advance
of
the
centre
which
was
to
be
drawn
back
as
far
as
the
obelisk
of
iron
at
which
there
was
a
position
more
commanding
this
plan
had
the
following
objects
the
first
was
to
draw
the
enemy
upon
the
open
plain
the
second
was
to
concentrate
our
force
still
more
and
to
place
it
in
two
lines
the
inner
one
to
be
composed
of
the
whole
of
the
and
a
part
of
the
division
which
were
withdrawn
for
repose
a
third
object
was
to
lead
the
enemy
to
believe
that
a
retrograde
movement
was
forced
upon
us
by
our
losses
and
that
we
felt
ourselves
too
weak
to
continue
the
defence
of
the
forest
to
execute
this
manoeuvre
and
to
enable
the
division
to
retire
without
being
molested
the
artillery
was
left
with
some
twenty
squadrons
of
cavalry
to
protect
the
retrograde
movement
this
artillery
and
cavalry
were
ordered
afterwards
to
evacuate
their
positions
gradually
and
the
former
to
take
post
in
the
centre
under
the
protection
of
the
whole
of
the
cavalry
which
were
in
escalon
and
prepared
for
a
general
attack
the
manoeuvre
was
as
admirably
executed
as
it
was
conceived
the
enemy
had
no
suspicion
of
its
object
but
presuming
it
to
be
a
flight
undertook
to
profit
by
it
it
was
at
this
moment
that
marshal
diebitsch
as
if
sure
of
victory
saw
himself
already
at
warsaw
and
on
the
field
of
battle
he
allowed
these
words
to
escape
him
then
it
appears
that
after
this
bloody
day
i
shall
take
tea
in
the
belvidere
palace
it
was
about
three
that
our
division
in
conformity
with
the
plan
adopted
began
to
retire
by
an
escalon
movement
to
hasten
the
execution
of
this
movement
it
was
ordered
that
the
columns
retiring
in
succession
on
reaching
a
considerable
distance
from
the
enemy
should
quicken
their
pace
as
they
proceeded
in
order
to
form
the
second
line
as
soon
as
possible
and
to
give
space
for
the
operations
of
the
artillery
and
cavalry
it
was
at
this
moment
that
general
zimirski
who
had
lost
several
horses
under
him
and
had
just
placed
himself
upon
a
fresh
horse
to
superintend
this
movement
was
struck
with
a
twelve
pound
ball
in
the
left
shoulder
which
carried
away
his
arm
and
caused
his
death
in
a
few
hours
the
melancholy
loss
of
this
general
was
most
deeply
felt
by
the
whole
army
and
particularly
by
his
own
division
but
it
did
not
interfere
with
the
execution
of
these
orders
the
brave
general
czyzewski
immediately
took
command
of
the
division
and
continued
the
orderly
movement
of
the
division
towards
the
rear
and
he
received
great
support
from
generals
rohland
and
zaluski
as
soon
as
the
last
columns
of
this
force
quitted
the
forest
xii
the
russian
troops
began
to
debouch
from
it
and
our
artillery
commenced
a
terrible
fire
the
brave
colonel
pientka
who
was
still
far
in
advance
checked
the
debouchement
from
the
forest
near
him
seated
with
the
most
perfect
sangfroid
upon
a
disabled
piece
of
artillery
this
brave
officer
directed
an
unremitting
fire
from
his
battery
the
artillery
and
cavalry
after
having
protected
the
retrograde
movement
of
the
centre
still
continued
to
keep
their
ground
to
enable
the
wings
also
to
retire
undisturbed
all
our
forces
were
then
in
movement
and
the
enemy
pressed
on
the
russian
columns
had
already
advanced
beyond
the
position
of
colonel
pientka
but
that
brave
officer
still
kept
up
the
defence
by
this
time
however
the
division
had
already
reached
their
destined
position
and
their
battalions
had
commenced
forming
such
was
the
state
of
things
when
between
kawenzyn
and
the
forest
a
cloud
of
russian
cavalry
was
seen
advancing
to
the
attack
having
at
their
head
five
regiments
of
heavy
cuirassiers
a
force
in
fact
of
some
forty
squadrons
or
between
eight
and
nine
thousand
in
all
colonel
pientka
with
his
artillery
supported
only
by
a
single
regiment
of
mazurs
still
held
his
post
to
give
yet
another
effective
fire
upon
this
advancing
cavalry
which
was
already
between
him
and
skrzynecki
division
and
then
to
save
himself
from
being
cut
off
he
quitted
at
full
gallop
a
post
which
he
had
occupied
for
five
hours
under
the
terrible
fire
of
the
artillery
of
the
enemy
this
rapid
movement
of
pientka
battery
and
the
regiment
of
cavalry
which
attended
him
animated
the
russian
cuirassiers
in
their
advance
and
the
infantry
and
artillery
of
the
enemy
followed
their
cavalry
at
this
moment
chlopicki
was
wounded
by
a
grenade
and
the
army
was
without
a
head
but
generals
skrzynecki
and
czyzewski
had
already
formed
their
divisions
into
squares
and
awaited
the
attack
of
the
enemy
the
russian
cavalry
advanced
upon
the
trot
and
came
in
a
direction
perpendicular
to
the
line
of
our
battery
of
rockets
which
was
posted
between
the
and
divisions
a
suddenly
a
discharge
from
this
battery
was
poured
into
their
ranks
and
enveloped
them
with
flame
and
noise
their
horses
galled
to
madness
by
the
flakes
of
fire
which
were
showered
over
them
became
wholly
ungovernable
and
breaking
away
from
all
control
spread
disorder
in
every
direction
the
ranks
were
soon
in
the
most
utter
confusion
and
in
a
short
time
this
enormous
body
of
cavalry
became
one
disordered
mass
sweeping
along
towards
the
fire
of
our
squares
in
a
very
few
minutes
that
cavalry
was
almost
annihilated
so
nearly
complete
in
fact
was
their
destruction
that
of
a
regiment
of
cuirassiers
which
was
at
the
head
of
the
attacking
force
called
the
regiment
of
albert
and
which
also
bore
the
designation
of
the
inscribed
upon
their
helmets
not
a
man
escaped
the
few
who
were
not
left
dead
upon
the
field
were
taken
prisoners
in
fact
some
hundred
horse
of
that
regiment
were
whirled
along
through
the
intervals
of
our
squares
and
were
left
to
be
taken
prisoners
at
leisure
the
wrecks
of
this
routed
cavalry
closely
pursued
by
our
lancers
carried
along
in
their
flight
the
columns
of
infantry
which
were
following
them
and
a
general
retreat
of
all
the
enemy
forces
commenced
the
battle
was
gained
the
cry
of
forever
arose
along
our
line
and
reached
the
walls
of
warsaw
to
cheer
the
hearts
of
its
anxious
inhabitants
nothing
was
wanting
but
a
skilful
commander
in
chief
to
our
forces
to
have
insured
the
entire
destruction
of
the
russian
army
two
thousand
prisoners
among
them
twenty
officers
of
different
grades
five
pieces
of
cannon
and
upwards
of
a
thousand
horses
were
the
trophies
of
that
immortal
day
the
memory
of
which
will
be
forever
terrible
to
tyrants
it
was
nearly
five
when
the
russian
army
commenced
a
general
flight
and
even
evacuated
its
first
position
which
it
had
occupied
in
the
early
morning
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
order
to
follow
up
the
pursuit
was
wanting
szembek
alone
threw
himself
at
times
with
his
division
among
the
russian
ranks
and
took
a
great
number
prisoners
baggage
and
chests
of
ammunition
according
to
the
declaration
of
general
szembek
if
during
the
retreat
of
the
enemy
a
charge
of
cavalry
and
artillery
had
been
ordered
between
the
left
wing
and
the
centre
of
the
enemy
a
great
part
p
of
that
wing
which
was
considerably
detached
from
the
centre
would
have
been
cut
off
this
could
have
been
easily
done
for
no
part
of
our
little
reserve
was
brought
into
action
during
the
day
and
they
were
eager
to
be
permitted
to
make
the
charge
the
prince
radzivil
after
the
withdrawal
of
general
chlopicki
from
the
army
in
consequence
of
his
wound
found
himself
without
council
and
not
feeling
himself
sufficiently
capable
to
risk
any
bold
manoeuvre
seeing
too
that
the
army
was
much
exhausted
by
the
fighting
of
that
day
and
the
preceding
and
fearing
also
that
the
vistula
might
become
impassable
and
the
bridges
be
endangered
by
the
melting
of
the
ice
in
fine
being
unwilling
to
take
upon
himself
the
great
responsibility
of
attempting
to
pursue
his
advantages
decided
to
give
the
army
an
interval
of
repose
and
to
occupy
the
time
in
it
some
farther
details
and
remarks
upon
this
important
battle
may
not
be
unacceptable
to
the
reader
in
regard
to
position
on
examining
critically
the
position
of
the
polish
army
we
notice
some
great
faults
the
right
wing
was
upon
a
plain
entirely
uncovered
and
exposed
to
the
commanding
fire
of
the
enemy
artillery
all
the
talents
of
the
brave
szembek
were
required
to
prevent
this
wing
from
being
unprofitably
sacrificed
this
same
wing
if
it
had
been
withdrawn
a
thousand
paces
farther
to
the
rear
in
such
a
manner
as
not
to
have
leant
on
the
marshes
of
the
vistula
but
have
occupied
the
small
wooded
hills
on
the
right
of
the
main
road
and
on
a
line
with
the
village
of
grochow
would
have
been
then
in
a
commanding
position
and
safe
from
the
tremendous
fire
of
the
enemy
the
enemy
would
probably
have
then
occupied
the
plain
and
thus
been
disadvantageously
exposed
to
our
fire
his
loss
would
have
been
doubled
and
all
the
charges
of
our
cavalry
and
infantry
would
have
been
much
more
effective
but
what
was
above
all
unpardonable
was
that
with
a
full
knowledge
of
the
intention
to
attack
us
together
with
a
consciousness
of
our
own
inferiority
of
force
and
the
nature
of
our
position
which
was
wanting
in
strength
no
fortifications
whatever
were
erected
although
four
days
and
five
nights
were
passed
in
that
position
during
which
the
national
guard
of
warsaw
and
all
the
unenrolled
population
who
would
have
cheerfully
volunteered
for
the
purpose
could
have
been
employed
in
the
construction
of
works
to
any
desired
extent
in
regard
to
the
centre
we
may
remark
that
it
was
indeed
covered
by
the
forest
of
elders
of
which
it
occupied
a
part
but
the
attack
of
this
forest
by
the
enemy
was
thus
made
necessary
and
their
repulse
cost
us
too
great
sacrifices
but
besides
the
sacrifices
which
the
support
of
such
a
position
required
our
troops
were
so
incessantly
occupied
with
repulse
of
the
successive
attacks
of
the
enemy
that
it
was
impossible
to
attempt
any
decisive
manoeuvre
it
was
not
there
in
fact
as
we
have
seen
that
the
battle
was
decided
but
at
the
obelisk
of
iron
and
by
other
means
the
centre
like
the
right
wing
should
have
been
withdrawn
so
far
as
to
have
been
on
a
line
with
the
village
of
grochow
and
in
such
a
manner
as
to
profit
by
all
the
commanding
positions
between
targowek
and
grochow
upon
which
our
artillery
which
as
the
case
was
were
upon
a
low
and
exposed
position
opposite
the
forest
would
have
been
very
advantageously
posted
in
general
our
whole
position
was
too
extended
reaching
from
kawenzyn
to
the
marshes
of
the
vistula
at
goclaw
it
ought
to
have
been
from
the
beginning
more
concentrated
and
supported
on
the
outermost
circumvallations
of
praga
b
it
could
thus
have
profited
by
the
advantageous
positions
which
adjoin
those
defences
in
consequence
of
this
too
great
extent
of
position
our
forces
remained
in
a
single
line
for
five
hours
in
succession
in
most
dangerous
exposure
in
regard
to
the
evolutions
although
the
details
were
admirably
executed
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
the
left
wing
did
not
yield
a
sufficient
support
to
the
other
bodies
the
communications
with
that
wing
were
not
well
sustained
another
effect
of
the
too
great
extent
of
the
position
the
line
of
the
enemy
was
encumbered
with
artillery
and
there
were
favorable
moments
for
a
general
attack
on
that
artillery
by
our
cavalry
such
opportunities
were
perceived
by
our
generals
of
cavalry
and
the
attack
suggested
by
them
to
the
commander
in
chief
but
nothing
was
done
the
greatest
fault
of
all
however
and
that
which
perhaps
saved
the
russian
army
from
entire
destruction
was
the
neglect
to
follow
up
the
enemy
in
his
retreat
and
by
a
judicious
manoeuvre
to
cut
off
his
right
wing
as
was
perfectly
practicable
by
such
a
manoeuvre
as
it
will
be
seen
was
in
fact
afterwards
successfully
practised
by
skrzynecki
at
wavre
where
a
great
part
of
that
same
force
were
taken
prisoners
the
battle
of
grochow
cost
the
enemy
in
killed
wounded
and
prisoners
according
to
the
reports
published
by
the
russians
themselves
men
on
our
side
the
loss
amounted
to
but
to
give
the
reader
an
idea
of
the
terrible
fire
of
that
day
it
may
be
remarked
that
there
was
not
a
single
general
or
staff
officer
who
had
not
his
horse
killed
or
wounded
under
him
full
two
thirds
of
the
officers
and
perhaps
the
same
proportion
of
the
soldiers
had
their
clothes
pierced
with
balls
and
more
than
a
tenth
part
of
the
army
were
slightly
wounded
though
not
unfitted
for
service
in
this
battle
the
and
divisions
of
infantry
suffered
the
most
and
twenty
of
their
officers
were
mortally
wounded
with
i
would
not
desire
to
present
a
revolting
picture
of
the
horrors
of
a
yet
to
impress
upon
the
reader
how
great
a
scourge
tyranny
is
to
mankind
i
could
wish
to
point
out
to
him
along
the
whole
road
from
kawenzyn
to
the
marshes
of
goclaw
hillocks
of
dead
at
every
step
especially
in
the
forest
of
elders
where
rank
upon
rank
was
seen
prostrate
upon
the
earth
indeed
so
strewed
with
bodies
was
this
forest
that
it
received
from
that
day
the
name
of
forest
of
the
with
the
twilight
our
whole
army
began
to
evacuate
their
position
and
to
cross
the
vistula
to
warsaw
the
passage
of
the
river
occupied
the
whole
night
on
the
morning
of
the
next
day
all
that
remained
of
our
forces
upon
the
right
bank
were
two
battalions
of
infantry
and
pieces
of
cannon
which
were
at
the
of
praga
the
russians
were
well
satisfied
with
our
passage
of
the
vistula
for
they
felt
the
need
of
repose
it
was
at
first
presumed
that
in
a
few
days
the
enemy
would
storm
praga
this
however
was
soon
found
not
to
be
their
intention
and
for
what
cause
we
can
not
conjecture
they
continued
in
a
state
of
complete
inaction
such
then
was
the
end
of
the
grand
operation
of
marshal
diebitsch
with
his
colossal
forces
by
which
it
was
his
purpose
to
put
an
end
to
the
war
in
a
few
days
the
boasted
crosser
of
the
balkan
with
from
to
men
and
pieces
of
cannon
was
not
only
unable
to
crush
as
he
proposed
to
do
an
army
of
scarcely
men
and
cannon
but
was
beaten
by
that
small
army
and
only
escaped
a
total
ruin
from
the
absence
of
a
competent
leader
to
the
polish
forces
such
facts
so
rare
in
history
can
not
be
too
frequently
impressed
upon
the
mind
of
the
reader
and
they
should
be
held
up
to
the
view
of
every
despot
to
teach
him
upon
what
a
frail
foundation
his
confidence
in
numbers
may
rest
and
to
convince
him
that
his
masses
must
melt
away
and
be
dispersed
before
a
people
who
on
their
own
soil
are
resolved
to
throw
off
the
yoke
of
despotism
and
who
fight
for
liberty
with
the
energy
of
despair
the
nation
and
the
army
occupied
this
interval
of
repose
in
giving
thanks
to
providence
for
the
successes
of
the
preceding
day
in
all
the
churches
te
deums
were
sung
as
well
as
in
the
chapels
of
the

warsaw

was
received
by
the
people
with
solemnities
the
senate
accompanied
by
the
inhabitants
repaired
to
the
camp

patriotic
addresses
were
delivered
and
a
public
fete
given
to
the
army
for
three
successive
nights
warsaw
was
illuminated
and
the
inscription
the
defenders
of
their

was
every

seen
unequal
to
the
description
of
these
moments
of
exultation
of
a
people
animated
with
the
recovery
of
their
freedom
i
can
only
say
that
they
were
moments
which
will
live
forever
in
the
heart
of
every
pole

in

it
was
on
that
occasion

the
prince
michael
radziwil
actuated
by
the
noblest
impulses
and
having
a
single
view
to
the
good
of
his
country
abdicated
the
chief
command
surrendering
his
trust
into
the
hands
of
the
national
government
with
the
avowal
that
he
did
not
feel
himself
sufficiently
capable
to
continue
to
hold
so
responsible
a
post
this
step
which
showed
a
great
elevation
of
character

the
nation
with
feelings
of
gratitude

prince
radziwil

admirable
as
was
the
conduct
of
all
our
artillery
every
man
in
which
deserved
a
decoration
yet
among
this
artillery
the
battery
of
colonel
pientka
must
be
distinguished
without
yielding
a
step
of
ground
that
battery
held
its
place
for
five
hours
and
it
often
happened
during
the
battle
that
this
single
battery
was
left
exposed
alone
to
the
fire
of
thirty

forty
of
the

it
was
computed
that
this

alone
caused
a
greater
loss
to
the
enemy
than
the
entire
loss
that
his
whole
artillery
caused
in

ranks

not

in

chiefly
of
grape
which
pientka
kept
up
for
five
hours

at
the
distance
often
of
a

killed
six

were

all
the

much
occupied
to
give
the
ordinary
attention
to
these
duties
on
that
day
several

filled

enemy
had

reflections
were

those
unfortunate

were

be
sacrificed
not
one
of

mass

the
justice

the
cause
for
which
they
were
thus
sacrificed
what
consolation
could
there
be
in
the

agonies
of
suffering
incurred
in
such
a
cause
there
could

consoled
with
the
thought

the
good

his
country

the
deaths
of
the
russian
and
the
polish
soldier
were
thus

what
reward
awaits

he
most
generally
dies

if
he
survives
is
too
much
broken
down
to
be
able
to
gain
a
subsistence
afterwards
the
russian
soldier
besides
the
fatigues
of
the
general
service
is
subject
to
a
private
service
under
any
one

the
merest
subaltern
perhaps
who
far
from
rewarding
him
for
such
services
abuses
him

the
more

pay
of
a
russian
soldier

a
groat

day
and
even
out
of
this
little
pay
his
superiors
exact
a
profit
the
consequence
is
that
the
degree
of
his
misery
is
excessive
and
he
would
be
in
extremity
if
the
proprietors
of
land
where
he
is
quartered
did
not
succor
him
what
other
recompense
is
given
to
these
wretched
men
who
are
thus
led
to
the
sacrifice
of
their
lives
for
the
of
a
despot
who
while
the
soldier
covered
with
wounds
is
groaning
under
his
sufferings
spends
his
time
in
luxurious
enjoyment
and
perhaps
mocks
at
the
abjectness
of
men
who
are
thus
willing
instruments
of
his
pleasure
what
other
recompense
for
all
this
perhaps
to
this
soldier
is
given
a
medal
of
brass
which
if
his
commander
in
a
moment
of
good
humor
as
he
passes
down
the

may
have
addressed
him
with
the
title
of

token

this

awaited
the
polish
soldier
on
his
return

was
received
by
his
countrymen
with

mothers
lifted
their

him

the
following
in
one
of
the
attacks
upon
the
forest
of
elders
when
the

had
gained
possession
of
it

was
an
interruption
to
our
advance
from

cut
across

which
it
was
necessary
to
pass
the

observing
the
effect
of
this
obstruction
poured
a
heavy
fire
of
grape
upon
the
spot
to
add
to
the
confusion
lieutenant
czaykowski
who
commanded
a
platoon
of
grenadiers
of
the
regiment
in
the
attacking
columns
had
passed
with
his
platoon
this
small
ditch
when
he
received

grape
shot
in

he
fell
he
cried
advance

continued
this
cry
regardless

his
suffering

he
lay
prostrate

those
brave
grenadiers
animated
by
this
noble
spirit
pushed
their
attack
with
such
fury
that
they
drove
the
enemy
from

our
artillery

bravely
fought

of

a
battery
posted
near

incidents
of

to
be
mentioned

indicating
how
little

it

often
seen
that

would
drag
themselves

a

by
an
unanimous
voice
to

of

the
hero
of
dobre
general
john
skrzynecki
a
man
of
the
most
devoted
patriotism
of
great
decision
of
character
and
uncommon
military
talent
he
was
above
all
eminently
possessed
of
that
rapidity
of
that
capacity
of
seizing
conjunctures
which
enabled
him
in
the
midst
of
the
most
complicated
movements
to
perceive
and
instantly
to
profit
by
every
advantage
which
offered
itself
this
general
was
in
the
time
of
the
russian
government
and
at
the
commencement
of
our
revolution
colonel
of
the
regiment
of
infantry
of
the
line
a
regiment
by
which
he
was
regarded
with
an
almost
filial
attachment
on
the
enrollment
of
new
forces
after
the
revolution
had
taken
place
he
was
made
general
of
brigade
in
the
month
of
january
before
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
he
was
advanced
to
the
rank
of
general
of
a
division
and
the
command
of
the
division
of
infantry
was
confided
to
him
at
the
head
of
which
division
as
the
reader
already
knows
he
gained
laurels
in
several
brilliant
actions
on
the
at
proclamation
was
made
of
the
abdication
of
the
prince
radzivil
and
the
appointment
of
general
skrzynecki
as
commander
in
chief
of
the
army
the
nation
to
whom
the
great
merit
of
this
officer
was
already
so
well
known
received
this
annunciation
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
no
dissentient
voice
was
heard
even
the
oldest
generals
in
the
service
warmly
applauded
the
choice
general
skrzynecki
on
receiving
the
chief
command
addressed
to
the
army
on
the
of
february
the
following
proclamation
and
brethren
god
has
willed
that
through
your
choice
i
should
be
made
the
instrument
of
his
providence
in
the
important
trust
to
which
i
have
been
designated
the
senate
the
chamber
of
deputies
and
the
national
government
have
honored
me
with
a
difficult
task
which
i
can
not
worthily
execute
but
as
your
valor
and
constancy
shall
second
me
soldiers
we
have
before
us
an
enemy
proud
of
his
former
successes
of
his
strength
in
numbers
and
of
the
influence
which
he
exercises
in
europe
but
if
in
one
point
of
view
his
power
appears
formidable
on
the
other
hand
the
outrages
with
which
the
russian
government
have
oppressed
us
render
that
enemy
so
guilty
in
the
eyes
of
god
and
of
man
that
full
of
confidence
in
providence
and
the
sacredness
of
our
cause
we
can
boldly
measure
our
strength
with
him
we
have
only
to
swear
in
our
hearts
that
we
will
be
faithful
to
that
motto
which
we
so
often
repeat
to
conquer
or
die
for
our
country
and
we
shall
surely
serve
as
an
example
in
the
annals
of
the
world
of
encouragement
to
the
defenders
of
the
sacred
rights
of
the
people
if
we
do
not
succeed
in
conquering
our
powerful
enemy
we
will
not
live
to
submit
to
him
to
him
who
has
violated
in
regard
to
us
every
obligation
of
good
faith
there
is
enough
of
glory
in
the
sacrifice
which
i
call
on
you
to
make
and
in
this
heroic
career
and
so
full
of
danger
i
offer
you
crowns
of
laurel
we
shall
be
sure
to
gain
them
if
you
will
support
me
by
your
valor
your
union
your
subordination
and
your
promptitude
in
performing
the
orders
which
will
be
given
you
the
first
object
upon
which
the
attention
of
the
general
in
chief
was
fixed
was
the
state
of
the
army
even
from
the
first
hour
of
his
investiture
with
the
chief
command
prompt
and
energetic
orders
and
instructions
were
issued
to
form
new
forces
to
complete
those
which
were
already
in
a
state
of
formation
and
to
fill
up
the
ranks
of
the
regiments
which
had
suffered
in
the
late
engagements
during
the
dictatorship
of
chlopicki
and
under
the
command
of
the
prince
radziwil
all
the
arrangements
of
the
military
administration
were
sluggishly
attended
to
as
the
reader
is
well
aware
at
the
time
of
the
battle
of
grochow
there
had
been
only
ten
thousand
new
infantry
levied
and
even
this
infantry
was
neither
well
organized
nor
armed
the
only
armament
of
the
greater
part
of
them
consisted
of
pikes
or
pitchforks
it
was
the
same
with
the
new
cavalry
of
which
the
number
at
the
time
of
that
battle
did
not
amount
to
more
than
three
thousand
six
hundred
and
even
these
forces
were
not
formed
by
the
exertions
of
the
government
but
were
volunteers
in
the
arsenals
the
works
were
not
conducted
with
promptitude
this
department
of
the
military
administration
had
been
made
great
account
of
on
paper
but
was
in
reality
neglected
as
we
have
before
remarked
the
time
was
occupied
in
useless
diplomatic
discussions
while
the
subject
of
the
greatest
importance
the
armament
of
our
forces
was
lost
sight
of
general
skrzynecki
was
well
aware
of
this
neglect
and
soon
gave
a
new
aspect
to
these
matters
from
the
of
march
in
which
he
commenced
the
inspection
of
the
arsenals
he
was
daily
occupied
with
this
duty
entering
into
all
the
details
with
which
he
was
familiarly
acquainted
and
infusing
a
new
vigor
and
promptitude
into
this
essential
department
of
the
military
administration
in
fact
in
the
several
manufactories
of
arms
six
hundred
musquets
per
day
were
soon
made
the
soldiers
who
before
had
but
rarely
seen
their
commander
and
to
the
greater
part
of
whom
indeed
the
former
commander
was
personally
unknown
were
elated
to
meet
their
chief
often
among
them
and
their
enthusiasm
was
augmented
by
the
frequent
words
of
encouragement
with
which
he
took
every
occasion
to
address
them
general
skrzynecki
established
a
new
regulation
in
respect
to
the
conferring
of
orders
of
merit
which
was
that
none
should
be
given
either
to
the
officers
or
the
soldiers
but
upon
the
expressed
consent
and
approbation
of
the
latter
by
thus
submitting
the
conferring
of
these
honors
to
the
judgment
of
the
soldier
he
encouraged
his
destroyed
the
power
of
the
personal
influence
of
the
generals
and
added
much
to
the
value
of
those
honors
as
a
motive
for
exertion
the
time
at
which
skrzynecki
received
the
chief
command
was
indeed
a
happy
period
with
us
and
enthusiasm
was
then
at
the
very
greatest
height
no
stronger
evidence
of
this
could
be
given
than
the
fact
that
the
women
of
poland
actually
formed
three
companies
of
infantry
composed
from
their
own
sex
our
army
was
victorious
and
full
of
energy
and
being
then
at
warsaw
it
enjoyed
all
the
conveniences
which
could
be
required
by
an
army
in
a
state
of
war
their
arms
of
every
kind
were
well
constructed
and
in
good
order
the
russian
army
on
the
other
hand
was
in
a
most
disadvantageous
situation
their
number
had
been
sensibly
diminished
and
was
diminishing
every
day
from
the
difficulty
of
subsistence
and
shelter
situated
as
they
were
in
the
environs
of
praga
which
had
been
sacked
and
burnt
by
themselves
marshal
diebitsch
and
his
army
began
to
be
convinced
by
the
victories
which
had
been
gained
over
them
and
the
firm
resistance
which
they
had
uniformly
met
that
they
were
fighting
with
a
nation
which
had
resolved
to
sacrifice
every
thing
for
liberty
and
independence
and
that
this
war
which
diebitsch
expected
and
even
promised
to
finish
in
a
few
weeks
would
be
long
protracted
and
presented
to
him
as
yet
no
hope
of
a
fortunate
issue
a
certain
degree
of
disorder
also
began
to
take
place
in
the
russian
army
caused
by
the
physical
wants
and
the
severe
treatment
to
which
the
soldiers
were
subjected
their
wounded
and
sick
were
left
neglected
and
were
accumulated
in
great
numbers
in
the
ruined
buildings
of
the
villages
exposed
to
the
open
air
in
the
severe
month
of
february
desertions
too
began
to
take
place
every
day
indeed
small
parties
of
deserters
and
among
them
even
officers
arrived
at
warsaw
those
men
assured
us
that
a
smothered
discontent
pervaded
the
army
they
stated
that
the
soldiers
had
marched
under
the
expectation
that
they
were
to
act
against
the
french
and
belgians
and
not
against
the
poles
whose
revolution
had
been
represented
to
them
as
merely
the
revolt
of
one
or
two
regiments
and
that
seeing
the
true
state
of
things
great
numbers
of
them
desired
even
to
unite
with
us
when
a
favorable
moment
should
offer
these
unfortunate
men
who
were
in
the
most
deplorable
state
with
tears
in
their
eyes
addressed
themselves
to
our
soldiers
in
terms
like
these
poles
do
you
think
that
we
willingly
fight
against
you
what
could
we
do
we
were
compelled
to
march
against
you
by
the
force
of
blows
many
of
our
brethren
gave
out
and
falling
from
exhaustion
on
the
road
have
died
under
the
blows
of
the
knout
these
deserters
stated
also
that
such
a
severity
was
exercised
in
the
regulations
of
the
camp
that
some
officers
were
shot
merely
for
having
spoken
on
political
subjects
and
that
it
was
strictly
forbidden
to
any
persons
to
assemble
together
to
the
number
of
three
or
four
such
information
satisfied
us
that
although
the
russian
army
was
strong
in
numbers
morally
speaking
it
was
weak
our
own
army
began
soon
to
conceive
high
hopes
and
to
dream
of
victory
under
its
brave
chief
at
this
period
with
the
exception
of
prussia
who
had
publicly
manifested
her
hostility
to
our
cause
none
of
the
great
powers
had
directly
injured
us
austria
was
occupied
with
italy
from
france
and
england
the
poles
had
even
cherished
hopes
of
a
favorable
interposition
from
the
former
especially
after
the
intelligence
derived
from
the
correspondence
of
the
two
ministers
lubecki
and
grabowski
found
among
the
papers
of
constantine
which
has
been
presented
to
the
reader
giving
satisfactory
evidence
that
russia
was
in
preparation
for
a
campaign
against
her
and
showing
that
our
cause
was
the
cause
of
france
we
had
certainly
the
right
to
cherish
the
strongest
hopes
but
more
important
still
than
all
these
circumstances
was
the
intelligence
received
of
a
revolution
which
had
broken
out
in
the
russian
department
of
orenburg
under
the
famous
yermolow
and
the
point
of
concentration
of
which
was
to
have
been
the
town
of
samara
situated
on
the
frontier
of
europe
and
asia
the
highest
expectations
were
entertained
of
the
results
of
this
movement
from
our
knowledge
of
the
character
of
this
celebrated
general
and
of
his
great
influence
as
one
of
that
distinguished
family
of
yermolow
perhaps
the
most
influential
in
the
empire
which
in
fact
cherishes
pretensions
to
the
throne
and
of
the
distinction
which
he
had
acquired
as
a
bold
and
firm
leader
in
a
service
of
many
years
his
proclamations
to
the
russians
of
which
a
few
copies
were
found
on
the
persons
of
their
officers
who
were
killed
in
the
battle
of
grochow
were
full
of
energy
and
breathed
the
sentiments
of
a
true
republican
of
one
who
calmly
and
dispassionately
aims
at
the
good
of
his
country
these
proclamations
were
published
in
all
the
gazettes
of
warsaw
on
the
first
of
march
this
general
was
for
a
long
while
governor
of
the
provinces
beyond
the
caucasus
abassia
migretia
imiretia
and
georgia
provinces
which
were
conquered
from
persia
and
turkey
besides
possessing
a
great
degree
of
military
knowledge
yermolow
was
familiar
with
the
duties
of
the
civil
administration
those
provinces
were
happy
under
his
government
he
ameliorated
the
state
of
the
commerce
by
which
they
were
enriched
the
city
of
tiflis
under
him
rapidly
increased
to
a
great
extent
that
city
became
in
fact
a
general
depot
of
all
the
trade
of
armenia
persia
and
turkey
in
asia
this
general
who
could
have
held
a
post
of
greater
distinction
and
nearer
the
throne
asked
for
this
situation
with
the
view
to
be
removed
as
far
as
possible
from
that
court
which
he
despised
and
the
intrigues
of
which
excited
his
abhorrence
out
of
the
reach
of
its
influence
he
could
follow
the
impulses
of
his
heart
and
labor
for
the
happiness
of
his
fellow
men
but
this
separation
was
not
enough
those
intrigues
passed
the
barrier
of
the
caucasus
to
interrupt
him
in
his
benevolent
labors
several
commissions
were
sent
to
make
inquiries
into
his
administration
in
various
departments
yermolow
to
avoid
these
persecutions
sent
in
his
resignation
general
now
marshal
paszkewiczh
filled
his
place
yermolow
on
quitting
his
post
retired
to
his
own
estates
in
the
government
of
orenburg
and
lived
there
quietly
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
the
breaking
out
of
the
revolutions
of
france
belgium
and
at
last
that
of
poland
filled
his
heart
with
joy
he
hoped
that
the
time
was
near
at
hand
when
the
people
would
have
security
for
their
rights
and
would
emerge
from
the
darkness
into
which
despotism
had
plunged
them
he
commenced
the
revolution
in
his
part
of
the
empire
and
as
we
learnt
at
warsaw
sustained
himself
for
a
long
while
against
the
superior
forces
which
were
sent
against
him
he
was
not
however
sufficiently
supported
by
the
people
and
was
too
isolated
to
continue
hostilities
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
he
did
not
commence
this
movement
in
the
provinces
which
border
upon
poland
a
view
of
the
state
of
the
polish
forces
at
the
period
of
appointment
to
the
chief
command
after
the
battle
of
grochow
the
polish
grand
army
was
composed
as
at
the
commencement
of
the
war
of
nine
regiments
of
infantry
each
consisting
of
three
battalions
they
amounted
after
deducting
the
losses
sustained
during
the
campaign
to
about
the
newly
formed
infantry
which
was
in
the
battle
of
grochow
amounted
to
about
from
which
are
to
be
deducted
about
lost
in
that
battle
the
whole
force
of
infantry
then
amounted
to
men
the
cavalry
was
also
composed
of
nine
regiments
each
comprising
four
squadrons
making
after
the
deduction
of
the
losses
by
that
battle
about
in
all
the
cavalry
consisting
of
eighteen
squadrons
can
also
be
estimated
after
the
losses
at
grochow

taken
possession
of
by
the
russians
after

battle
of
grochow
and
was
burnt
by
them
to
the
inhabitants
this
was
a
disaster
but
for
our
defence
it
was
a
most
favorable
circumstance
as
it
left

unprotected

opened

this

on

the

regretted
the

in
regretting
their

they
applauded
the

indeed
felt
this
regret
strongly

on
the

hand
he
was
satisfied
that
he
had
done
his
duty
the
opinion
of
most
of
the
patriots
was
decidedly
expressed
against
general
szembek
who
upon
such
a
point
of
personal
feeling
could
forget
his
duties
to
his
country
and
abandon
the
ranks
of
his

reproached
himself
for
the
sacrifice

he
had
thus
made
the
following
anecdote

show
the
degree
to
which
general
skrzynecki
was
beloved
by
the

and
the
influence
which
his
appointment
to
the

had
on
the
minds
of
the
soldiers
a
soldier
named
golembiewski
of

who
had
been
wounded
in
the
battle
of

had
on
the
day
of

left
the
hospital
convalescent
although
his
wounds
were
not
entirely
healed
skrzynecki
while
inspecting
the
regiment
noticed
him
with
his
head
still
bandaged
and
said
to
him
dear
comrade
why
have
you
left
the
hospital
in
such
a
state
you
had
better
return
immediately
the
soldier
answered
i
have
heard
of
your
courage
and
your
achievements
and
how
much
you
are
beloved
by
the
nation
and
i
could
not
refuse
myself
the
satisfaction
of
being
present
at
the
first
fire
under
your
command
and
in
which
i
hope
that
the
polish
army
will
be
victorious
skrzynecki

the

women
wishing

the
example
of
the
daughters
of
sparta
and
to
form
three
companies
under
the
command
of
several
ladies
of
the
most
distinguished
families
they
proposed

clothing
of

these
patriotic
propositions
however
neither
the
nation

the
general
in
chief
were
willing
to
accept
considering
that
the
fatigues
of
a

would
be
too
trying
to
the
female
constitution

to
satisfy
in
some
degree
the
noble
impulses
of
these
ladies
the
three
companies
were
distributed
among

hospitals
to
take

footnote
to
satisfy
the
reader
that
marshal

had
began
to
be
conscious

his
weakness
the

trifling
circumstances
will
suffice
on
the
first
day
of
march
two
of
our
soldiers
who
had
been
made
prisoners
by
the
russians
returned
to
warsaw
and
presented
themselves
to
the

in

one
of
them
who
was
a
galician
volunteer
on
the
question
being
asked
in
what
way
they
escaped
answered
that
general
diebitsch
himself
dismissed
them
with
a
present
of
four
ducats
each
enjoining
them
to
make
it
known
in
the
army
and
to
say
that
each
soldier
who
should
go
over
to
the
russians
would
receive
a
like
sum
and
in
addition
to
it
a
portion
of
land
sufficient
for
his
maintenance
and
that
moreover
they
should
not
be
forced
to
enter
the
service
of
the
army
he
also
assured
them
that
if
they

accept
these
terms
they
should
be

published
in

order
of
the
day
to
the

this
adoption
of
such
a

sufficiently
the

began
to
feel

the
situation

some
remarks
upon

conduct

which
the
following
is
a
passage
such
conduct
is
reproachful
to
you
and
by
it
you
have
strengthened
the
current
suspicions
of
the
world
that
the
passage
of
the
balkan
which
has
given
you
such
a
name
in
history
was
made
upon
a
bridge
of
gold

if
such
measures
might
have
been
successful
in
turkey
they
will
not
do
in
poland
if
you
do
not
by

know
it
i
can
assure
you
that
every
pole
is
willing
to
sacrifice
his
all
in
the
cause
of
his
country

your
offers

avail
little

to
you

combat
of
pulawa
xiii
the
prince
of
wirtemberg
having
been
beaten
as
the
reader
has
seen
by
general
dwernicki
at
swierza
and
nowawies
was
forced
to
retreat
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
pulawy
and
to
repass
the
vistula
opposite
that
place
the
ice
of
the
river
was
fortunately
for
him
still
strong
enough
to
admit
of
a
passage
upon
its
surface
but
notwithstanding
this
advantage
he
had
been
pursued
by
dwernicki
so
closely
through
the
whole
of
his
line
of
retreat
that
he
daily
lost
great
numbers
of
prisoners
it
was
on
the
night
of
the
of
february
that
this
passage
was
made
by
the
russians
and
pulawy
occupied
by
them
as
the
position
of
that
place
was
strong
and
commanding
general
dwernicki
did
not
think
it
expedient
to
attack
the
enemy
in
front
who
although
beaten
were
still
superior
in
force
he
conceived
the
plan
of
passing
the
vistula
at
a
point
at
some
distance
below
pulawy
and
of
making
an
attack
upon
the
russian
right
wing
on
the
evening
of
the
the
brave
colonel
lagowski
with
infantry
and
two
squadrons
of
cavalry
passed
the
vistula
on
reaching
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
he
threw
himself
into
the
forests
which
surround
pulawy
the
position
of
lagowski
would
have
been
critical
if
the
russians
had
obtained
intelligence
of
this
manoeuvre
but
they
had
no
suspicions
of
it
colonel
lagowski
expecting
that
general
dwernicki
would
soon
make
a
demonstration
in
front
left
the
forest
and
approached
the
town
keeping
up
a
brisk
fire
of
skirmishers
the
russians
surprised
by
this
attack
directed
against
it
as
strong
a
fire
of
artillery
and
infantry
as
its
suddenness
would
allow
but
our
light
troops
succeeded
in
approaching
the
town
and
getting
possession
of
several
houses
keeping
up
a
continued
fire
the
two
squadrons
of
cavalry
which
had
been
sent
to
attack
the
enemy
in
his
rear
threw
themselves
upon
him
at
the
same
time
with
great
impetuosity
the
consternation
of
the
russians
became
general
the
greatest
disorder
soon
followed
and
a
retreat
was
commenced
which
was
attended
with
the
loss
of
several
hundred
men
and
horses
and
four
pieces
of
artillery
the
enemy
in
evacuating
the
town
set
it
on
fire
to
complete
the
barbarities
which
they
had
been
practising
pulawy
a
spot
one
of
the
most
favored
of
nature
and
perhaps
presenting
one
of
the
finest
scenes
in
europe
was
soon
a
mass
of
ruins
the
sight
of
which
filled
the
bosom
of
every
pole
with
regret
and
horror
those
ruins
such
indeed
as
the
whole
country
is
now
filled
with
evidences
of
the
horrible
barbarity
of
the
russians
in
recalling
to
the
minds
of
the
poles
the
lost
beauty
and
magnificence
of
their
country
will
be
a
pledge
of
their
eternal
hatred
of
the
despotism
which
authorized
those
ravages

the
russians
had
gained
already
a
considerable
distance
from
pulawy
before
the
corps
of
general
dwernicki
approached
it
and
of
course
the
whole
glory
of
that
defeat
is
due
to
colonel
lagowski
the
corps
of
general
dwernicki
after
a
short
repose
at
pulawy
renewed
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
on
that
night
in
every
part
of
their
route
the
enemy
stragglers
were
continually
falling
into
their
hands
this
corps
overtook
the
enemy
so
soon
that
in
order
to
save
himself
from
total
destruction
he
was
forced
to
give
battle
battle
of

xiv
xv
general
dwernicki
in
his
pursuit
of
wirtemberg
had
the
intention
of
effecting
the
destruction
of
this
corps
before
they
could
reach
lublin
to
accomplish
this
object
he
took
advantage
of
the
two
roads
which
lead
from
pulawy
to
lublin
remaining
himself
with
the
greater
part
of
his
forces
upon
the
causeway
which
leads
to
lublin
by
konskawola
kurow
and
markuszew
he
sent
a
small
detachment
with
two
pieces
of
cannon
by
the
other
and
smaller
road
which
traversing
the
forest
between
belzyc
and
pulawy
presents
a
shorter
and
more
direct
route
to
lublin
this
road
had
not
been
occupied
by
the
enemy
colonel
lagowski
who
commanded
this
detachment
had
instructions
to
follow
out
this
road
and
to
keep
up
a
constant
communication
with
the
superior
force
under
general
dwernicki
he
was
ordered
to
keep
himself
constantly
abreast
of
the
enemy
at
the
moment
that
he
should
hear
the
fire
of
our
cannon
he
was
directed
to
hasten
to
the
attack
of
the
enemy
on
his
left
wing
or
on
his
rear
as
circumstances
might
direct
this
manoeuvre
was
executed
with
the
utmost
punctuality
the
enemy
pressed
in
upon
the
causeway
by
the
larger
body
under
dwernicki
and
thus
forced
to
give
battle
took
a
position
upon
the
heights
of
the
town
of
kurow
in
doing
which
his
consternation
or
his
inconsiderateness
was
such
that
he
neglected
the
ordinary
means
of
security
and
did
not
occupy
the
roads
which
centre
at
that
place
not
even
that
which
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
for
him
to
occupy
the
one
which
leads
from
belzyc
to
pulawy
in
fact
he
had
even
neglected
to
send
out
reconnoissances
on
any
side
supposing
that
our
entire
force
was
before
him
on
the
causeway
this
battle
commenced
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
march
and
continued
only
a
few
hours

dwernicki
after
reconnoitering
the
enemy
position
which
was
commanding
and
strengthened
in
its
front
by
sixteen
pieces
of
cannon
xv
thought
it
expedient
to
commence
with
a
fire
of
skirmishers
only
under
cover
of
which
he
manoeuvred
his
cavalry
upon
the
russian
wings
with
the
sole
purpose
of
occupying
the
attention
of
the
enemy
until
the
detachment
of
colonel
lagowski
should
make
its
appearance
the
enemy
on
the
other
hand
commenced
a
warm
fire
from
his
artillery
and
threw
forward
his
light
troops
in
every
direction
some
hours
passed
in
this
manner
the
enemy
attempting
from
time
to
time
to
force
our
position
but
the
hour
of
his
destruction
was
approaching
general
dwernicki
perceiving
from
an
elevation
of
ground
the
detachment
of
lagowski
a
advancing
upon
the
enemy
rear
instantaneously
gave
orders
for
the
cavalry
to
concentrate
themselves
the
signal
for
advance
was
then
given
and
the
cavalry
having
formed
on
each
side
of
the
main
road
pressed
forward
and
fell
upon
the
centre
of
the
enemy
at
the
same
moment
a
charge
was
made
by
the
cavalry
of
lagowski
upon
the
enemy
rear
the
disorder
and
consternation
of
the
russian
forces
was
indescribable
in
a
moment
ten
pieces
of
cannon
a
thousand
prisoners
some
hundreds
of
horses
with
many
wagons
of
ammunition
and
baggage
fell
into
our
hands
the
route
was
general
the
enemy
fled
and
his
loss
was
much
increased
by
a
fire
of
grape
from
the
two
pieces
of
artillery
of
colonel
lagowski
which
he
placed
by
the
side
of
the
road
from
kurow
to
lublin
over
which
the
russians
retreated
this
road
was
literally
covered
with
dead
nothing
but
the
coming
on
of
night
saved
the
enemy
from
entire
destruction
after
this
battle
the
forces
of
the
prince
of
wirtemberg
ceased
to
act
as
a
corps
what
remained
of
them
took
the
direction
of
lublin
where
the
corps
of
general
dwernicki
arrived
the
next
day
having
taken
prisoners
during
the
whole
route
the
prince
of
wirtemberg
barely
escaped
from
our
hands
for
he
was
in
quarters
in
that
city
when
our
advanced
detachments
entered
it
and
was
just
able
to
save
himself
by
flight
such
was
the
end
of
this
russian
corps
which
when
it
began
to
act
against
dwernicki
with
his
small
force
of
men
and
ten
pieces
of
cannon
consisted
of
infantry
and
pieces
of
cannon
in
the
course
of
eleven
days
general
dwernicki
gave
battle
to
this
corps
four
separate
times
viz
at
swierza
nowawies
pulawy
and
kurow
and
besides
the
loss
he
caused
them
in
killed
and
wounded
he
took
prisoners
pieces
of
cannon
besides
horses
with
a
great
quantity
of
ammunition
baggage
in
all
these
actions
the
corps
of
general
dwernicki
lost
but
men
in
killed
and
wounded
the
panic
which
had
began
to
prevail
in
the
russian
forces
in
consequence
of
these
disasters
reached
such
a
degree
that
at
times
the
mere
sight
of
our
troops
was
sufficient
to
put
them
to
flight
the
russian
commander
in
chief
deprived
the
prince
of
wirtemberg
of
his
post
and
his
name
was
not
heard
of
during
the
rest
of
the
war
general
dwernicki
by
his
victories
over
this
corps
had
completely
freed
the
department
of
lublin
from
the
presence
of
the
enemy
on
arriving
at
lublin
he
restored
the
authority
of
the
national
government
in
that
place
and
the
region
about
he
made
the
necessary
arrangements
for
reinforcing
his
corps
and
left
for
in
the
environs
of
zamosc
while
these
successful
operations
of
general
dwernicki
in
the
southern
part
of
the

were
in
progress
and
by
this
series
of
victories
he
was
approaching
the
frontiers
of
wolhynia
and
podolia
our
arms
were
not
less
successful
in
the
north
the
brave
colonel
valentin
with
a
small
detachment
of
partizans
fought
the
enemy
with
success
between
modlin
and
pultusk
this
detachment
was
thrown
into
that
region
acting
however
more
particularly
between
the
rivers
wkra
and
orsyca
in
order
to
hold
in
check

was
occupying
with

a
number
of

late
it
was
near
eight
before
he
approached
with
his
division
at
which
time
the
two
divisions
united
left
praga
to
commence
their
attack
but
this
operation
being
thus
retarded
could
not
be
made
effective
the
enemy
seeing
our
movement
had
time
to
prepare
themselves
to
counteract
it
our
forces
having
advanced
a
mile
or
two
upon
the
main
road
commenced
a
fire
of
tirailleurs
and
the
enemy
began
to
retire
as
it
was
designed
to
act
upon
kawenczyn
a
battalion
was
sent
to
attempt
an
attack
on
the
forest
of
elders
well
known
to
the
reader
but
as
the
enemy
was
quite
strong
at
that
point
and
particularly
in
artillery
a
fire
from
which
was
immediately
opened
upon
our
force
the
attack
was
not
made
and
our
battalion
was
ordered
to
withdraw
the
russians
at
about
began
to
show
a
stronger
force
upon
the
plains
of
wawr
their
artillery
also
opened
a
fire
upon
the
main
road
this
fire
had
continued
an
hour
when
our
generals
not
perceiving
that
the
artillery
was
protected
by
cavalry
decided
to
make
a
charge
upon
them
with
the
regiment
of
mazurs
and
the
regiment
of
light
cavalry
this
brigade
of
cavalry
under
the
command
of
the
brave
colonels
blendowski
and
miller
threw
themselves
with
courage
upon
that
artillery
when
at
the
moment
of
the
charge
two
regiments
of
attaman
cossacks
which
were
posted
in
a
wood
adjoining
displayed
their
front
and
advanced
to
charge
our
cavalry
upon
the
flank
and
rear
our
attack
therefore
failed
and
it
was
owing
to
good
fortune
alone
that
by
a
rapid
bending
of
our
flank
this
body
of
cavalry
was
saved
from
total
ruin
this
unfortunate
affair
cost
us
a
heavy
loss
of
men
and
of
both
of
the
brave
colonels
who
commanded
the
attack
at
about
as
the
enemy
began
to
debouch
from
the
great
forest
with
increased
forces
it
was
decided
to
return
to
warsaw
and
thus
ended
this
reconnoissance
which
had
it
been
executed
by
more
skilful
generals
might
have
had
the
best
success
for
all
the
russian
regiments
which
had
advanced
towards
praga
at
a
considerable
distance
from
their
main
forces
might
have
been
taken
a
reprimand
was
publicly
given
to
the
two
generals
gielgud
and
jankowski
for
their
remissness
in
executing
their
instructions
the
only
advantage
which
was
gained
by
this
reconnoissance
was
the
taking
of
a
great
quantity
of
fascines
and
other
materials
prepared
for
a
storm
of
praga
and
the
collection
from
off
the
field

a
considerable
quantity

had
been
left

enemy
after
the

acting
in
concert
with

he
was
to
occupy
the

this
was
the
first
encounter
with
this

impatiently
for
the

to
try
their
strength
with
them
two
young

time
to
display
his

to
make

rushed
upon
him
with
an
impetuous

will
perhaps
be

topographical

some
details
of
this

fortress
of

is
in

with
the
former
river
not
far
from
this
fortress
the
small
river
wkra
also
joins
the
narew
the
fortress
is
thus
situated
between
three
rivers
in
addition
to
this
peculiarity
of
its
situation
in
regard
to
the
rivers
its
commanding
elevation
makes
it
a
point
of
great
strength
opposite
to
it
is
the
small
town
of
but
this
town
is
so
low
that
it
is
commanded
by
the
fortress
and
it
is
besides
too
distant
for
the
erection
of
batteries
by
which
the
latter
could
be
bombarded
with
success
this
post
is
very
important
in

to
tactics

it
is
a
key

position
to
protect
or
to
act
upon
all
operations
between
the

vistula
marshal
diebitsch
considering
these
circumstances
and
seeing
that
an
open
attack
was
scarcely
possible
was
led
to
attempt
negotiation
the
letter
sent
by
the
marshal
was
full
of
flattering
language
in
regard
to
the
heroism
of
the
polish
army
he
permitted
himself
however
to
say
that
it
was
to
be
regretted
that
such
a
degree
of
heroism
was
not
exhibited
in
a
better
cause
that
the
brave
polish
army
was
made
a
sacrifice
of
by
some
ambitious
and
opinionated
men
who
had
forgotten
their
duties
to
their
monarch
and
their
oaths
of
fidelity
from
such
men
as
those
he
wished
to
distinguish
the
count
leduchowski
for
whom
he
had
the
highest
esteem
and
who
he
was
convinced
had
no
desire

that
it

forced
to
take
up
arms
by
the
enormity
of
those
acts
of
tyranny
which
were
not
perhaps
even

whilst
the
division
of
gielgud
and
the
cavalry
of
kicki
were
to
occupy
the
great
road
leading
to
grochow
the
division
under
rybinski
was
to
march
upon
the
right
wing
of
the
enemy
at
kawenczyn
k
this
last
division
was
to
drive
the
enemy
from
his
position
in
as
short
a
time
as
possible
if
the
enemy
forces
at
kawenczyn
were
found
to
be
greatly
superior
to
his
own
general
rybinski
was
directed
to
continue
his
fire
and
await
a
reinforcement
which
should
be
immediately
sent
to
him
if
he
should
be
so
fortunate
as
to
take
kawenczyn
general
rybinski
was
to
send
by
a
small
road
leading
from
this
place
through
the
forest
to
milosna
a
few
battalions
to
that
village
other
battalions
were
to
be
dispersed
in
the
forest
between
that
small
road
and
the
main
road
having
made
those
arrangements
the
position
of
kawenczyn
was
to
be
vigorously
defended
in
order
to
baffle
every
effort
of
the
enemy
to
retake
it
the
accurate
and
prompt
execution
of
this
plan
was
expected
to
effect
the
cutting
off
of
all
the
enemy
forces
which
were
to
be
found
upon
the
field
of
wawr
in
regard
to
the
division
of
gielgud
upon
the
main
road
the
instructions
given
were
that
it
should
not
commence
its
fire
until
apprised
of
general
rybinski
having
gained
possession
of
kawenczyn
this
division
was
till
then
to
limit
its
attention
to
the
object
of
retaining
the
enemy
in
his
position
near
praga
long
enough
to
give
time
for
the
corps
of
general
rybinski
to
occupy
the
above
mentioned
forest
and
to
operate
in
the
enemy
rear
the
moment
for
the
advance
of
the
division
was
to
be
when
the
fire
of
the
light
troops
of
rybinski
should
be
heard
in
the
forest
all
these
dispositions
were
executed
with
the
greatest
exactitude
under
the
protection
of
a
thick
fog
the
division
of
general
rybinski
having
quitted
praga
at
midnight
arrived
as
far
as
the
environs
of
kawenczyn
without
being
in
the
least
disturbed
by
the
enemy
this
skilful
general
had
the
precaution
not
to
attack
the
enemy
until
an
hour
before
in
the
interval
while
resting
in
the
woody
ground
near
kawenczyn
he
sent
forward
a
patrol
with
directions
to
approach
near
enough
to
ascertain
as
far
as
practicable
the
position
the
strength
and
the
nature
of
the
force
of
the
enemy
and
sent
another
patrol
in
the
direction
of
the
forest
of
elders
to
reconnoitre
the
enemy
there
those
patrols
returned
with
the
intelligence
that
the
enemy
force
could
not
be
great
as
they
could
perceive
no
large
detachments
placed
as
advanced
posts
it
was
between
five
and
six
in
the
morning
when
the
first
fire
of
general
rybinski
at
kawenczyn
gave
notice
to
the
division
of
gielgud
at
praga
that
it
was
the
time
to
advance
the
brigade
of
cavalry
under
kicki
with
the
and
regiments
of
lancers
having
with
them
three
pieces
of
cannon
spread
out
their
flankers
and
advanced
slowly
directed
continually
by
the
fire
of
general
rybinski
who
in
the
mean
time
had
pushed
two
battalions
at
the
charge
supported
by
a
few
pieces
of
artillery
and
had
carried
the
enemy
position
by
storm
and
taken
possession
of
kawenczyn
the
enemy
were
instantly
routed
by
this
impetuous
attack
and
lost
three
pieces
of
cannon
the
division
passed
through
kawenczyn
sent
two
battalions
to
milosna
occupied
the
forest
a
in
the
rear
of
the
principal
force
and
commenced
a
fire
when
this
fire
was
heard
by
our
forces
b
upon
the
main
road
they
pushed
forward
and
a
general
and
rapid
advance
was
commenced
under
cover
of
the
thick
fog
two
regiments
of
cossack
cavalry
who
were
posted
in
columns
near
the
obelisk
of
iron
were
borne
down
before
them
a
great
number
of
prisoners
were
taken
on
the
spot
our
brave
lancers
under
kicki
animated
by
this
success
did
not
halt
in
their
attack
they
fell
upon
an
advanced
post
of
russian
artillery
of
three
pieces
near
grochow
and
took
them
before
they
had
time
to
fire
by
seven
or
eight
the
enemy
was
entirely
surrounded
and
his
retreat
by
milosna
was
wholly
cut
off
it
was
with
the
dissipation
of
the
fog
that
we
witnessed
the
confusion
into
which
had
been
thrown
the
whole
advanced
guard
of
giesmar
composed
of
four
regiments
or
sixteen
battalions
of
infantry
eight
squadrons
of
cavalry
and
pieces
of
cannon
the
disorder
of
this
advanced
guard
was
such
that
the
russian
battalions
had
actually
been
firing
against
each
other
and
that
fire
ceased
only
with
the
clearing
up
of
the
fog
the
and
russian
regiments
amounting
to
men
with
all
their
officers
and
colors
were
taken
in
a
body
and
with
them
the
brigadier
general
lewandowski
if
the
fog
had
continued
half
an
hour
longer
so
that
we
could
have
occupied
the
road
to
karczew
the
whole
of
this
advanced
guard
would
have
been
taken
for
what
remained
of
them
saved
themselves
only
by
flying
along
that
road
this
attack
which
was
the
business
of
a
few
hours
forced
the
enemy
to
quit
his
advantageous
position
in
the
commanding
forest
between
wawr
and
milosna
which
he
had
occupied
for
a
month
and
on
which
he
had
constructed
considerable
fortifications
driven
from
this
important
position
he
could
only
expect
to
be
subjected
to
still
greater
losses
at
milosna
three
battalions
of
the
enemy
with
four
pieces
of
cannon
placed
as
an
isolated
detachment
were
dispersed
and
their
cannon
taken
another
isolated
detachment
of
cavalry
of
hussars
and
cossacks
of
posted
at
janowek
met
the
same
fate
and
prisoners
were
taken
in
every
direction
our
two
divisions
pursued
the
enemy
with
unremitted
celerity
and
followed
by
our
main
forces
reached
at
which
place
was
the
corps
of
general
rosen

of
about
men

pieces

marsh
opposite
to

to
attack
him
would
have
had
to
traverse
the
dyke
constructed
over
this
marsh
the
commanders
of
the
two
divisions
considered
it
expedient
to
await
the
arrival
of
our
whole
force
which
approached
some
hours
after
general
skrzynecki
satisfied
that
an
attack
made
over
the
dyke
upon
the
commanding
position
of
the
enemy
on
the
other
side
in
broad
day
would
cost
too
great
a
sacrifice

men
determined
to
amuse
him
by
a
constant
fire
of
our
skirmishers
who
advanced
as
far
as
the
marshy
ground
which
divided
the
two
armies

permit
a
little
before
night
the
general
in

ordered
all
the
cavalry
to
be
brought
together

formed
in
columns
of
attack
with
the
two
squadrons
of
carbiniers
under
the
brave
colonel
sznayder
at
their
head
at
the
approach
of
twilight
he
ordered
these
columns
to
pass
the
dyke
on
a
trot
and
to
throw
themselves
upon
the
enemy
on
the
right
and
left

with
the
sabre

the
cavalry
was
passing
the
dyke
the
artillery
was
to
open
a
general
fire
ceasing
however
when
the
passage
of
the
dyke
should
be
effected
the
order
was
given
and
this
mass
of
cavalry
under
the
fire
of
the
artillery
raised
the
hurrah
and
passed
the
dyke
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
followed
by
our
infantry
having
at
their
head
the
brave
regiment
the
enemy
was
in
such
consternation
that
he
was
not
in
a
state
to
make
a
defence
and
his
whole
battery
was
overthrown
full
three
thousand
prisoners

was
still
in
great
disorder
infantry
cavalry
artillery
and

were
mingled
together
pressing
their
retreat
at

our
cavalry
took
up

upon
some
positions
the
enemy
attempted
to
make
a
stand
but
every
such
attempt
was
thwarted
and
he
was
carried
along
before
our
troops
this
was
the
case
in
the
position
of
minsk
and
of
jendrzeiow
where
two
regiments
of
russian
cavalry
were
routed
by
the
second
regiment
of
chasseurs
it
was
the
same
case
in
the
forest
of
kaluszyn
where
our
artillery
approached
the
russian
and
poured
upon
them
a
fire
of
grape

scattered

ranks

russians

no

in
a
state

into

panic

commenced
a
general
flight
they
were
pursued
by
general
lubinski
as
far
as
kaluszyn
where
night
closed
upon
the
scene
of
destruction
this
day
cost
the
enemy
nearly
as
much
as
the
preceding
besides
their
loss
in
dead

fell
into
our

with
three
standards
four
pieces
of
cannon
and
a
hundred
vehicles
of
baggage
ammunition
c
in
fact
the
whole
baggage
of
the
corps
but
the
most
agreeable
success
of
our
army
on
that
day
was
the
taking
possession
of
the
hospitals
of
minsk
and
jendrzeiow
in
which
as
many
as
two
hundred
of
our
comrades
were
lying
wounded
to
witness
the
joy
of
those
brave
sufferers
was
recompense
enough
for
all
our
fatigues
the
impetuosity
of
our
attack
was
such
that
the
enemy
had
not
time
to
burn
the
magazines
of
milosna
minsk
and
kaluszyn
which
fell
into
our
hands
to
make
a
recapitulation
of
the
loss
of
the
enemy
on
those
two
days
it
was
as
follows
two
of
their
generals
lewandowski
and
szuszerin
taken
prisoners
with
as
many
as
sixty
officers
of
different
grades
soldiers
in
killed
wounded
and
prisoners
pieces
of
cannon
seven
standards
horses
a
great
quantity
of
different
kinds
of
arms
and
implements
and
as
many
as
vehicles
of
various
kinds
the
disasters
of
these
two
russian
corps
were
the
cause
of
the
abandonment
of
the
plan
which
had
been
adopted
by
marshal
diebitsch
of
passing
the
vistula
between
pulawy
and
maceiowice
opposite
kozienice
with
the
greater
part
of
his
army
and
to
execute
which
he
had
left
his
position
on
the
latter
days
of
march
and
had
reached
the
environs
of
ryk
xvi
the
fear
of
losing
those
two
corps
together
with
the
guard
had
led
him
to
return
in
the
direction
of
the
town
of
kock
to
afford
them
succor
after
these
days
so
fortunate
for
us
in
which
the
russian
forces
were
again
driven
from
before
the
walls
of
warsaw
the
position
of
their
army
was
as

their
right
wing
formed
of
the
remains
of
the
corps
of

and
rosen
was
at

advanced
posts
extended
to

the
russian

which
as
we
have
said
had
formed
the
plan
of
joining
their
main
body
and
had
left
ostrolenka
by
the
road
through
wengrow
was
obliged
in
consequence
of
the
successes
of
our
army
to
abandon
that
plan
and
to
retire
again

the
environs

the
corps

this
a
small
corps

the
left
bank
of
the
vistula

command

main
forces
were
acting
with
such
success
the
two
detached
corps
under
generals
uminski

dwernicki
had
also
fought
gloriously
and
gained
important
advantages
the
corps
of
general
dwernicki
spread
terror
in
its
vicinity
and
the
russians
were
compelled
to
send
a
new
corps
against
him
under
the
command
of
general
kreutz
so
that
the
combined
russian
forces
opposed
to
him
amounted
to
men
greatly
superior
as
this
force
was

did
not
dare
to
attack

dwernicki

reinforced
every
day
by
volunteers
coming
from
galicia
and
volhynia
soon
found
himself
at
the
head
of
men
and
pieces
of
cannon
this
corps
in
concert
with
the
garrison
of
zamosc
was
sufficient
to
hold
in
check
all
the
operations
of
the
enemy
in
that
quarter
on
the
of
march

dwernicki
sent
a
reconnoissance

did
not
stay
for
the
approach
of

he
took
possession
of
the
different
batteaux
which
were
prepared
for
and
were
waiting
the
arrival
of
the
russian
force
at
the
distance
of
a
league
from
the
town
passing
the
river
bug
with
his
corps
in
these

he
suddenly
attacked
the
russian
advanced

with
such
success
that
he
took
two
thousand
prisoners
and
six
pieces
of
cannon
and
several
hundred
horses
with
these
trophies
he
returned
and
joined
the
corps
to
their
astonishment
for
they
had
received
but
a
single
report
from
him
and
had
no
expectation
of
such
results
the
rumor
of
the
continual
successes
of
this
corps
of
general
dwernicki
spread
along
the
borders
of
the
dnieper
reached
the
distant
regions
of
our
brethren
in
the
ukraine
and
awakened
in
them
an
ardent
desire
to
unite
themselves
to
our
cause
for
the
continued
and
glorious
advantages
of
this
corps
which
commenced
its
operations
with
infantry
cavalry
and
three
pieces
of
cannon
and
had
nearly
destroyed
two
russian
corps
those
of
kreutz
and
wirtemberg
taking
prisoners
and
thirty
pieces
of
cannon
the
national
government
promoted
its
brave
commander
to
the
rank
of
full
general
of
cavalry
and
honored
him
with
the
surname
of
the
famous
czarnecki
the
ancient
polish
chief
the
general
in
chief
communicated
to
general
dwernicki
his
promotion
with
the
sincere
thanks
of
the
national
government
and
at
the
same
time
sent
him
instructions
and
advice
in
regard
to
the
operations
which
he
was
then
to
follow
the
corps
of
general
dwernicki
was
to
manoeuvre
in
such
a
manner
as
to
menace
continually
the
left
wing
of
the
russian
grand
army
keeping
this
object
in
view
he
was
not
unless
with
the
expectation
of
some
very
extraordinary
advantages
to
remove
himself
very
far
from
the
fortress
of
zamosc
this
place
was
to
serve
as
a
in
every
case
of
sudden
danger
about
this
point
he
was
to
manoeuvre
and
from
thence
he
was
to
push
himself
as
circumstances
might
allow
into
the
environs
of
lublin
and
wlodawa
to
trouble
incessantly
the
above
mentioned
wing
and
even
the
rear
of
the
russian
grand
army
in
this
instruction
of
keeping
himself
near
the
fortress
of
zamosc
and
in
the
palatinate
of
lublin
generally
another
advantage
was
contemplated
viz
that
he
might
receive
daily
accessions
of
volunteers
from
volhynia
and
podolia
our
brethren
in
those
provinces
would
hasten
to
join
themselves
to
his
victorious
eagles
of
which
disposition
indeed
he
received
continual
evidence
and
in
this
manner
his
corps
would
be
gradually
increased
by
such
aid
from
those
provinces
without
attracting
the
attention
of
the
enemy
as
the
provinces
of
volhynia
and
podolia
from
their
geographical
character
having
no
large
forests
were
not
in
a
state
to
carry
on
a
partizan
warfare
as
was
quite
practicable
in
lithuania
and
samogitia
and
also
as
the
russians
had
several
corps
upon
the
frontiers
of
turkey
which
by
being
concentrated
in
that
open
country
might
be
dangerous
to
our
small
forces
general
skrzynecki
was
of
the
opinion
that
general
dwernicki
by
keeping
near
the
frontiers
of
the
above
mentioned
provinces
should
rather
act
by
a
moral
influence
upon
their
inhabitants
than
hazard
certain
advantages
by
entering
them
the
river
wieprz
was
to
be
the
leaning
point
of
his
left
wing
and
the
river
bug
of
his
right
between
those
two
rivers
in
a
woody
and
marshy
region
he
would
find
many
strong
natural
positions
of
such
he
would
take
advantage
and
endeavor
to
strengthen
them
by
different
fortifications
general
dwernicki
in
receiving
these
instructions
was
also
invested
with
full
powers
by
the
national
government
to
institute
a
provisional
administration
over
the
above
provinces
in
case
that
circumstances
should
lead
him
to
establish
a
footing
there
similar
to
that
of
the
kingdom
in
general
and
to
bring
them
into
a
state
to
act
with
effect
in
concert
with
the
rest
of
the
kingdom

so
constantly
in

charge
upon
artillery
that
if
the
artillery
of
the
enemy
began
its
fire
and
the

was
not
ordered
our

were
always
disappointed
this
was
the
case
at
the
battle
of
kurow
on
the
of
march
as
the
enemy
in
that
battle
had
placed
his
artillery
in
a
commanding
position
and
as
general
dwernicki
was
awaiting
the
arrival
of
detachments
under
colonel
lagowski
in
the
direction
of
belzge
he
was
not
disposed
then
to
give
the
order
for
a
charge
but
preferred
to
amuse
the
enemy
by
various
manoeuvres
of
his
cavalry
passing
down
the
front
of
his
lancers
he
observed
that
they
wore
a
look
of
dissatisfaction
on
noticing
this
he
was
astonished
and
demanded
an
explanation
does
this
mean
my
dear
comrades
said
he
are
sad
at
a
moment
when
after
so
many
victories
you
ought
to
be
joyful
the
lancers
replied
general
it
is
an
hour
since
the
artillery
commenced
their
fire
and
you
do
not
allow
us
to
charge
upon
them
the
general
smiling
answered
yourselves
content
you
shall
soon
have
that
satisfaction
and
in
a
short
time
as
the
reader
will
remember
general
dwernicki
seeing
the
detachment
of
colonel
lagowski
approaching
gave
the
order
for
an
attack
upon
the
artillery

in
a
moment
they
were
driven
from
their
position

and
ten
pieces

their
cannon

the
russians
to
whom
the
name
of
dwernicki
was
a
terror
would
speak
of
him

the
following
manner
can
we
make
of
such
a
general
he
performs
no
manoeuvres
and
never
permits
our
artillery
to

generalship
appears
to
lie
only

xiv
the
insurrection
in
dispositions
of
the
lithuanians
at
the
breaking
out
of
our
their
offers
of
were
rejected
by
the
view
of
the
condition
of
lithuania
under
the
russian
scheme
of
the
russian
government
to
destroy
all
polish
national
feeling
in
that
the
insurrection
is
brought
about
by
the
massacre
of
the
patriots
at
capture
of
numerous
towns
by
the
insurgents
and
dispersion
of
their
storm
of
wilno
and
delivery
of
several
partizan
corps
are
their
destination
and
successes
it
had
pleased
providence
thus
far
to
make
the
success
of
our
arms
in
every
point
a
just
chastisement
of
our
enemy
and
encouraged
by
this
success
the
nation
had
begun
to
cherish
the
brightest
hopes
for
the
future
their
confidence
and
exultation
were
complete
when
the
report
was
received
that
our
brethren
in
lithuania
and
samogitia
had
risen
to
break
the
yoke
of
despotism
and
had
openly
commenced
a
revolution
the
certain
confirmation
of
this
happy
intelligence
was
brought
to
the
kingdom
by
one
of
the
students
of
the
university
of
wilno
this
brave
young
man
belonged
to
the
patriotic
club
which
had
been
secretly
formed
there
and
that
club
had
sent
him
to
warsaw
to
carry
the
authentic
intelligence
of
the
insurrection
then
it
was
at
last
that
the
voice
of
liberty
was
heard
upon
the
shores
of
the
baltic
and
at
the
sources
of
the
dwina
and
the
niemen
and
with
this
voice
was
heard
that
of
union
with
ancient
poland
the
brave
inhabitants
of
this
immense
region
animated
with
an
attachment
for
us
the
strength
of
which
ages
had
proved
regarded
themselves
only
as
a
part
of
one
great
family
with
ourselves
almost
within
hearing
of
the
bloody
combats
which
had
been
fought
they
could
not
restrain
themselves
from
joining
in
the
struggle
and
acting
side
by
side
with
us
for
our
common
poland
before
i
enter
upon
the
details
of
this
revolution
in
lithuania
the
reader
will
permit
me
to
refer
him
in
the
appendix
to
a
short
description
of
that
country
and
a
view
of
its
connection
with
poland
which
is
in
general
so
imperfectly
understood
the
lithuanians
of
wilno
knew
four
days
after
the
of
november
that
warsaw
had
given
the
signal
of
a
new
polish
insurrection
a
deputation
was
immediately
sent
by
them
to
the
dictator
chlopicki
announcing
to
him
all
lithuania
and
particularly
the
lithuanian
corps
of
strong
was
ready
to
pass
to
the
side
of
the
but
that
inexplicable
and
lamentable
dictatorship
this
so
great
and
so
generous
the
lithuanians
however
not
despairing
waited
for
a
more
propitious
moment
and
scarcely
was
the
dictatorship
abolished
when
the
national
government
thanks
to
the
thoughtful
care
of
joachim
lelewell
addressed
itself
officially
to
the
lithuanian
committee
every
disposition
was
made
for
a
rising
at
an
appointed
time
which
at
length
arrived
it
would
not
be
in
my
power
to
give
the
reader
a
just
idea
of
the
tyranny
and
persecution
to
which
the
polish
provinces
united
to
russia
were
subjected
if
the
kingdom
was
oppressed
it
has
always
had
some
glimmer
of
constitutional
right
but
in
the
provinces
the
only
constitution
was
absolute
power
those
provinces
abounding
in
resources
and
which
had
they
been
protected
by
free
laws
would
have
been
as
they
formerly
were
the
granary
of
europe
presented
every
where
traces
of
misery
being
exposed
to
the
abuses
of
the
russian
administration
and
its
agents
who
wrung
them
to
the
last
drop
to
enrich
themselves
justice
was
unknown
sometimes
the
governors
or
sprawnaks
men
of
most
depraved
conduct
changed
the
laws
at
their
own
will
and
not
to
obey
that
will
was
to
be
subject
to
be
sent
into
siberia
all
those
provinces
were
submerged
by
the
russian
military
who
were
quartered
in
every
village
and
those
soldiers
receiving
only
the
small
compensation
of
a
groat
a
day
which
was
altogether
insufficient
for
their
subsistence
levied
upon
the
inhabitants
the
means
of
their
support
but
the
cause
of
the
greatest
suffering
in
lithuania
was
that
in
order
to
prevent
all
sympathy
between
the
soldiers
and
peasantry
and
all
national
feeling
in
the
lithuanian
soldiers
most
of
the
levies
from
that
province
were
sent
to
serve
on
the
barbarian
frontiers
of
asia
while
russian
soldiers
were
substituted
for
them
who
were
without
any
sympathy
with
the
inhabitants
and
who
would
be
regardless
of
their
feelings
in
their
deportment
towards
them
and
merciless
in
their
exactions
it
was
not
so
under
alexander
the
arrangement
was
made
by
nicholas
no
idea
can
be
given
of
the
distress
which
it
caused
many
a
family
was
obliged
to
deny
themselves
their
necessary
food
to
supply
the
demands
of
the
military
tyrant
who
was
quartered
upon
them
the
peasantry
in
those
provinces
were
treated
like
brutes
no
civilization
not
the
least
glimmer
of
light
not
a
school
was
permitted
that
poor
race
were
kept
in
a
state
so
degraded
that
the
elements
of
civilization
seemed
to
be
lost
in
them
and
the
possibility
of
their
being
recovered
seemed
almost
hopeless
one
of
the
greatest
evils
was
the
systematic
endeavor
to
destroy
all
national
sympathy
with
poland
the
russians
carried
their
oppression
indeed
so
far
as
to
change
the
religion
of
the
country
and
to
introduce
the
greek
schism
but
through
all
these
persecutions
providence
saved
that
people
from
losing
their
national
sentiments
as
poles
on
the
contrary
they
have
proved
that
neither
time
nor
persecutions
will
ever
destroy
that
attachment
but
will
indeed
rather
strengthen
it
the
late
insurrections
in
lithuania
and
samogitia
which
have
been
so
long
under
the
russian
government
and
the
inhabitants
of
which
hastened
to
take
up
their
arms
at
the
signal
of
our
revolution
afford
a
sufficient
evidence
of
this
attachment
what
deserves
especially
to
be
noticed
is
that
in
lithuania
it
was
the
peasants
and
the
priests
joined
by
the
youths
of
the
academies
who
first
began
the
revolt
and
who
were
the
most
zealous
defenders
of
the
common
cause
that
heroic
people
commenced
the
revolution
without
any
munitions
and
without
any
arms
but
the
implements
of
husbandry
armed
in
most
cases
with
clubs
alone
they
abandoned
all
to
unite
in
our
aid
and
fought
with
courage
and
success
for
nearly
two
months
against
the
different
russian
corps
before
the
corps
of
gielgud
and
chlapowski
arrived
which
instead
of
succoring
them
by
the
misconduct
of
their
generals
sacrificed
the
lithuanians
as
well
as
themselves
and
gave
the
first
downward
impulse
to
our
cause
the
insurrection
of
lithuania
and
samogitia
was
propagated
with
rapidity
through
all
the
departments
of
those
provinces
the
commencement
was
made
in
the
departments
of
osmiany
and
troki
accelerated
by
the
following
circumstance
many
of
the
patriots
for
the
purpose
of
consulting
upon
the
different
arrangements
for
the
revolt
had
secretly
assembled
on
the
last
of
march
at
osmiany
and
held
their
secret
conferences
in
the
church
of
the
place
while
occupied
in
this
manner
a
loud
shouting
was
heard
in
the
town
a
regiment
of
cossacks
had
entered
the
place
and
a
great
part
of
the
regiment
surrounded
the
church
the
doors
were
broken
down
and
the
cossacks
entered
and
sabred
the
unfortunate
men
within
these
sacred
walls
wounded
as
they
were
those
who
survived
the
attack
were
thrown
into
wagons
to
be
carried
to
wilno
but
in
this
the
barbarians
did
not
succeed
a
few
escaped
from
their
bloody
hands
ran
into
the
suburbs
of
the
town
and
collected
the
peasantry
and
on
that
very
night
some
hundreds
of
the
inhabitants
having
been
got
together
osmiany
was
attacked
with
the
greatest
fury
by
the
patriots
several
hundreds
of
cossacks
were
massacred
the
others
took
flight
and
the
poor
prisoners
were
delivered
from
that
moment
the
flame
spread
to
the
departments
of
wilno
wilkomierz
rosseyny
and
szawla
in
a
few
weeks
more
than
twelve
towns
were
taken
by
storm
and
the
russian
garrisons
driven
out
and
dispersed
the
principal
of
these
towns
were
jarbourg
szawla
keydany
wilkomierz
kowno
troki
swienciany
rosienice
and
beysagola
in
a
short
time
more
than
a
thousand
russians
fell
under
the
blows
of
the
lithuanians
and
another
thousand
were
taken
prisoners
the
lithuanians
accoutred
themselves
with
their
arms
some
hundred
horses
and
several
pieces
of
cannon
were
also
taken
the
most
bloody
affair
was
the
storm
of
wilno
on
the
night
of
the
of
april
two
hundred
lithuanians
attacked
this
town
and
fought
with
russian
infantry
nearly
two
regiments
six
squadrons
of
cavalry
and
twelve
pieces
of
cannon
for
the
whole
night
the
lithuanians
pressed
their
attack
with
fury
they
took
the
powder
magazine
and
arsenal
where
they
found
many
arms
but
the
most
consolatory
success
was
the
rescuing
of
some
hundred
patriotic
students
and
proprietors
who
had
been
confined
in
prison
there
for
years
the
battle
of
keydany
and
szerwinty
was
also
severe
and
the
valor
of
the
brave
lithuanians
was
equally
displayed
there
at
keydany
twenty
of
the
brave
youths
of
the
academy
defended
the
bridge
over
the
niewiaza
against
two
squadrons
of
cavalry
while
on
the
other
side
some
hundreds
of
those
brave
youths
made
a
storm
upon
the
city
and
routed
the
garrison
which
consisted
of
three
squadrons
of
hussars
in
a
word
not
quite
lithuanians
armed
in
the
most
defective
manner
commenced
the
struggle
and
drove
out
garrisons
to
the
amount
of
eight
or
ten
thousand
russian
regular
troops
spreading
consternation
throughout
the
whole
of
the
enormous
space
between
the
dwina
and
the
niemen
their
numbers
were
soon
augmented
and
armed
with
weapons
taken
from
the
russians
their
forces
were
afterwards
divided
into
several
small
detached
partizan
corps
which
received
the
following
destination
the
corps
under
the
command
of
consisting
of
about
infantry
and
horse
was
to
observe
the
territory
upon
the
russian
frontier
between
jarbourg
upon
the
niemen
as
far
as
the
frontier
of
courland
this
corps
was
to
interrupt
the
transport
of
provisions
from
the
russian
territory
and
also
to
keep
a
communication
between
the
ports
of
the
baltic
sea
lipawa
and
polonga
so
as
to
secure
a
correspondence
with
foreign
vessels
which
might
arrive
with
ammunition
and
other
aid
for
poland
the
corps
consisted
of
about
infantry
under
the
command
of
and
and
were
to
act
between
uceamy
and
dawgeliszki
there
this
corps
of
partizans
was
to
profit
by
the
strong
positions
which
the
nature
of
the
country
offers
among
its
lakes
and
forests
this
corps
was
to
observe
the
great
road
which
leads
through
that
country
from
st
petersburgh
to
warsaw
and

the
garrison

designated
a
corps
under
the
command

composed
of
nearly
infantry
and

corps

itself
severely
felt

in

besides
these

a
detachment
of
horse
under
the
command
of
this
detachment
was
constantly
in
movement
and
kept
open
the
communications
between
the
other
corps

acted
as
occasion
required
it
was
especially
to
attempt
to
surprise
the
enemy
artillery
which
was
often
sent
in
an
unprotected
state
this
detachment
of
cavalry
with
the
first
named
corps
under
the
command
of
attacked
so
sudden
and
vigorously
the
russian
corps
under
the
command
of
general
szyrman
that
they
were
forced
to
take
refuge
upon
the
prussian
territory
at
memel
the
prussians
received
them
and
afterwards
permitted
them
to
leave
with
their
arms
and
ammunition
this
was
not
the
first
nor
the
last
example
of
such
relief
afforded
to
our
enemy
by
prussia
the
insurrections
of
lithuania
and
samogitia
which
had
begun
so
successfully
and
promised
to
extend
even
to
the
borders
of
the
dnieper
and
the
black
sea
could
not
but
threaten
the
utmost
danger
to
the
russian
forces
which
had
entered
the
kingdom
and
it
was
from
this
moment
that
the
situation
of
the
enemy
became
in
a
high
degree
critical
as
every
military
judge
will
perceive
the
danger
of
their
position
was
still
more
to
be
augmented
by
our
success
in
the
battle
of
iganie
on
the
of

marshal
diebitsch
as
is
known
to
the
reader
was
forced
by
our
victories
of
the
of
march
and
the
of
april
to
abandon
his
plan
of
passing
the
vistula
opposite
to
kozienice

to
think
of
nothing
farther
at
present
than
of
saving
the
two
corps

rosen

giesmar
and
the
guard
he
was
so
far
separated

them
while
between
kock

he
then
was
that
by
a
prompt
diversion
on

he
might

it
was

of
this
that
he
hastened
to
arrive
as
soon
as
possible
to

our

battle
of

xx
xxi
on
the
of
april
the
russian
army
was
nearly
in
the
same
position
as
we
have
last
described
them
the
main
body
under
marshal
diebitsch
were
in
the
environs
of
kock
and
the
combined
corps
of
rosen
and
giesmar
xx
were
upon
the
small
river
kostrzyn
at
boimie
our
army
also
had
not
changed
its
position
the
following
were
the
dispositions
for
the
attack
the
reader
on
examining
the
plan
will
see
that
the
two
corps
opposed
to
our
forces
which
were
at
latowicz
were
too
far
advanced
which
exposed
them
to
be
turned
on
their
left
wing
and
even
taken
in
the
rear
if
our
forces
there
should
succeed
in
driving
back
the
forces
of
the
enemy
on
the
road
from
latowicz
by
wodynie
to
siedlce
to
execute
this
movement
the
order
was
given
that
when
the
first
division
of
infantry
supported
by
pieces
of
cannon
should
commence
the
attack
upon
the
great
road
opposite
boimie
the
third
division
having
with
them
the
brigade
of
cavalry
of
kicki
should
leave
the
position
at
latowicz
before
and
take
the
direction
of
wodynie
to
attack
the
forces
which
it
might
find
there
but
if
those
forces
should
be
found
greatly
superior
the
division
was
to
remain
in
a
strong
position
at
jeruzalem
if
it
should
succeed
in
driving
back
the
enemy
forces
it
was
to
take
the
road
on
the
left
leading
from
wodynie
through
iganie
to
siedlce
every
effort
was
to
be
directed
to
the
point
of
arriving
as
soon
as
possible
upon
the
dyke
at
iganie
which
leads
over
the
marshes
of
the
river
sucha
by
a
prompt
manoeuvre
of
this
kind
the
enemy
could
not
as
we
have
said
escape
being
turned
for
the
better
execution
of
this
plan
the
enemy
was
to
be
harassed
on
the
main
road
in
order
that
general
prondzynski
who
was
to
command
the
expedition
to
wodynie
might
have
time
to
manoeuvre
upon
the
enemy
flank
a
division
of
cavalry
under
the
command
of
general
stryinski
was
to
leave
boimie
and
take
a
direction
on
the
left
towards
the
village
of
gruszki
to
pass
there
the
fords
of
the
river
kostrzyn
and
in
case
of
the
retreat
of
the
enemy
to
fall
upon
his
right
wing
having
issued
these
instructions
and
confided
the
command
of
the
little
corps
which
was
to
act
upon
the
enemy
left
wing
at
wodynie
to
general
prondzynski
the
general
in
chief
left
himself
for
boimie
to
lead
the
attack
in
person
upon
the
main
road
as
was
the
case
in
the
position
at
boimie
to
ii
we
were
separated
from
the
enemy
by
the
marshes
of
the
river
kostrzyn
the
two
ruined
bridges
upon
the
dyke
not
permitting
either
ourselves
or
the
enemy
to
pass
general
skrzynecki
contented
himself
with
opening
a
fire
of
artillery
upon
the
russian
position
in
order
to
occupy
the
attention
of
the
enemy
while
preparations
were
making
to
repair
the
bridges
sufficiently
to
admit
a
passage
the
moment
that
the
work
of
reconstructing
the
bridges
was
to
be
put
in
execution
was
to
be
decided
by
the
time
and
the
direction
in
which
the
fire
of
general
prondzynski
should
be
heard
if
the
latter
general
should
succeed
on
the
enemy
flank
then
of
course
the
bridges
were
to
be
reconstructed
if
not
they
were
to
remain
in
their
present
state
to
obstruct
the
passage
of
the
enemy
several
hours
were
occupied
by
this
fire
of
artillery
and
slight
manoeuvres
of
the
light
troops
when
at
last
between
eight
and
nine
the
fire
of
general
prondzynski
was
heard
who
had
evidently
passed
wodynie
and
had
begun
acting
on
the
enemy
flank
this
was
the
signal
to
commence
repairing
the
bridges
general
skrzynecki
with
his
suite
superintended
the
work
and
several
battalions
were
employed
in
bringing
together
the
materials
a
degree
of
consternation
was
observed
in
the
enemy
forces
in
consequence
of
the
attack
on
his
flank
and
his
columns
began
a
movement
but
his
artillery
continued
in
their
position
and
commenced
a
terrible
fire
upon
our
men
who
were
engaged
in
reconstructing
the
bridges
the
presence
of
mind
however
of
the
general
in
chief
who
exposed
himself
at
the
most
dangerous
points
encouraged
the
men
to
persevere
in
their
labors
under
this
destructive
fire
of
artillery
when
the
fire
on
his
flank
was
at
its
height
the
enemy
began
to
withdraw
his
artillery
and
commenced
a
retreat
by
between
and
no
part
of
the
enemy
forces
were
remaining
upon
the
plain
of
boimie
but
although
the
work
of
repairing
the
bridges
was
pressed
to
the
utmost
it
was
near
two
before
they
could
be
brought
to
such
a
state
as
to
admit
the
passage
of
artillery
and
although
several
battalions
of
the
infantry
had
passed
over
before
this
they
were
not
able
without
too
much
exposure
to
overtake
the
enemy
who
was
in
rapid
retreat
leaving
his
cavalry
as
a
rear
guard
it
was
not
until
the
last
mentioned
hour
that
the
whole
division
passed
the
bridges
and
pressed
forward
at
a
rapid
pace
in
the
pursuit
the
cavalry
advancing
upon
the
trot
while
this
was
taking
place
upon
the
great
road
to
boimie
general
prondzynski
xxi
a
who
according
to
his
instructions
advanced
to
wodynie
found
there
a
division
of
sixteen
squadrons
of
russian
cavalry
whom
he
drove
from
their
position
he
pursued
them
in
the
direction
of
siedlce
and
reached
the
environs
of
iganie
where
he
saw
the
corps
of
rosen
and
giesmar
b
in
full
retreat
at
this
moment
the
position
of
general
prondzynski
was
also
critical
for
as
the
reader
is
already
aware
our
main
army
was
not
in
a
condition
to
follow
the
enemy
on
account
of
the
obstruction
from
the
broken
bridges
if
the
enemy
had
thrown
himself
upon
prondzynski
they
could
have
crushed
him
and
with
their
other
forces
could
have
safely
passed
the
dyke
at
iganie
before
our
main
forces
retarded
as
they
were
could
have
arrived
this
danger
was
perceived
by
prondzynski
and
he
therefore
contented
himself
with
driving
the
division
of
russian
cavalry
c
from
a
position
they
had
taken
upon
the
heights
of
iganie
a
task
which
was
bravely
executed
by
the
cavalry
of
kicki
and
in
which
the
colonel
mycielski
was
wounded
and
occupying
that
position
himself
placing
there
the
brigade
of
romarino
to
defend
it
it
was
between
four
and
five
that
prondzynski
first
perceived
our
lancers
d
advancing
upon
the
main
road
a
great
part
of
the
enemy
particularly
of
their
cavalry
had
not
yet
passed
the
dyke
being
obstructed
by
their
artillery
generals
prondzynski
and
romarino
dismounting
from
their
horses
with
carbines
in
their
hands
placed
themselves
at
the
head
of
their
columns
and
commenced
a
fire
of
artillery
to
apprize
our
advancing
cavalry
of
their
position
at
the
sound
of
this
fire
the
cavalry
of
lubinski
raised
the
hurrah
rushed
forward
and
as
they
approached
near
the
brigade
of
romarino
threw
themselves
at
the
charge
upon
that
portion
of
the
enemy
rear
guard
which
had
not
yet
passed
the
dyke
our
infantry
and
cavalry
thus
fell
simultaneously
upon
them
the
enemy
were
terribly
cut
up
and
the
battle
was
gained
nearly
five
russian
battalions
amounting
to
men
with
their
officers
amounting
to
near
one
hundred
their
standards
and
eight
pieces
of
cannon
of
large
calibre
were
taken
six
regiments
of
cavalry
were
dispersed
many
of
them
were
lost
in
the
marshes
of
the
river
into
which
they
were
driven
and
several
hundred
men
and
horse
were
taken
prisoners
there
in
this
battle
which
may
be
counted
one
of
the
finest
in
the
campaign
the
circumstance
that
our
main
force
was
retarded
by
the
state
of
the
bridges
alone
saved
the
enemy
from
total
ruin
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
the
division
of
cavalry
of
general
stryinski
did
not
improve
its
time
and
effected
nothing
upon
the
right
flank
of
the
enemy
as
the
instructions
contemplated
the
negligence
of
that
general
was
inexcusable
and
the
commander
in
chief
deprived
him
of
his
command
we
lost
in
this
battle
about
five
hundred
men
in
killed
and
wounded
the
brave
general
prondzynski
was
slightly
wounded
before
night
the
two
armies
were
not
at
the
distance
of
a
from
each
other
but
all
was
tranquil
the
disorder
and
consternation
of
the
enemy
may
be
imagined
when
it
is
stated
that
our
columns
took
position
before
their
eyes
on
the
field
of
iganie
without
being
in
the
least
disturbed
by
them
the
reader
will
permit
me
to
fix
his
attention
upon
the
epoch
of
the
battle
of
iganie
which
was
indeed
the
brightest
moment
of
our
war
the
moment
of
the
highest
success
of
the
polish
arms
the
moment
of
the
most
confident
hopes
when
every
pole
in
imagination
saw
his
country
already
restored
to
her
ancient
glory
let
us
then
from
this
point
cast
a
look
backwards
to
the
commencement
of
this
terrible
contest
two
months
before
an
enormous
russian
force
had
invaded
our
country
defended
as
it
was
by
a
mere
handful
of
her
sons
and
any
one
who
had
seen
that
immense
army
enter
upon
our
soil
could
not
but
have
looked
on
poland
with
commiseration
as
about
to
be
instantaneously
annihilated
in
this
expectation
in
fact
all
europe
looked
on
and
at
every
moment
the
world
expected
to
hear
of
the
terrible
catastrophe
to
see
poland
again
in
chains
and
the
russian
arms
reposing
on
the
borders
of
the
rhine
such
in
fact
were
the
expectations
and
even
the
promises
of
marshal
diebitsch
providence
however
willed
otherwise
the
first
shock
of
the
polish
arms
with
the
russians
taught
the
latter
what
was
the
moral
strength
of
patriotism
what
a
nation
can
do
for
love
of
country
and
of
liberty
the
fields
of
siedlce
dobre
and
stoczek
the
first
witnesses
of
our
triumphs
and
the
grave
of
so
many
of
our
enemies
taught
them
to
respect
the
nation
which
they
expected
to
subdue
made
them
repent
the
audacity
of
having
passed
our
frontiers
and
gave
them
a
terrible
presage
of
how
dearly
they
would
have
to
pay
for
this
unjust
invasion
of
our
soil
battle
upon
battle
was
given
in
which
the
enemy
were
uniformly
subjected
to
the
severest
losses
the
two
great
roads
leading
from
different
directions
to
warsaw
on
which
they
had
followed
the
poles
were
covered
with
their
dead
thus
subjected
to
loss
at
every
step
the
enemy
reached
at
last
the
field
of
praga
and
there
collecting
all
his
forces
in
one
body
under
a
tremendous
fire
of
artillery
he
thought
to
overpower
our
small
forces
but
he
failed
to
do
it
the
immortal
day
of
the
of
february
was
nearly
the
destruction
of
his
enormous
force
and
after
fifteen
days
of
severe
fighting
that
great
army
which
was
designed
to
destroy
poland
and
to
make
europe
tremble
was
brought
to
a
state
of
extremity
the
autocrat
and
his
general
blushed
at
the
menaces
which
they
had
uttered
poland
believed
that
the
former
would
reflect
upon
those
bloody
struggles
and
the
immense
losses
which
he
had
suffered
and
would
be
unwilling
to
continue
such
sacrifices
nearly
russians
were
already
sacrificed
how
many
more
lives
might
he
not
still
lose
the
poles
although
conquerors
held
out
the
hand
of
reconciliation
as
the
letters
that
skrzynecki
addressed
to
diebitsch
have
proved
in
those
letters
written
with
the
utmost
cordiality
frankness
and
directness
he
invited
the
russian
commander
to
present
the
real
state
of
things
to
the
monarch
and
to
assure
him
that
the
poles
longed
to
put
an
end
to
this
fraternal
struggle
a
word
of
justice
of
good
will
indicative
of
a
disposition
to
act
for
the
happiness
of
the
nation
and
to
observe
the
privileges
which
the
constitution
granted
a
word
of
this
nature
from
the
lips
of
the
monarch
would
have
disarmed
the
poles
blood
would
have
ceased
to
flow
and
those
arms
outstretched
for
the
fight
would
have
thrown
away
the
sabre
and
would
have
been
extended
towards
him
as
to
a
father
to
him
the
author
of
a
happy
reconciliation
he
would
have
been
immortalized
in
history
and
would
have
taken
a
place
by
the
side
of
titus
far
however
from
that
true
and
noble
course
that
proud
autocrat
as
well
as
his
servant
diebitsch
thought
little
of
the
thousands
of
human
beings
he
was
sacrificing
far
from
such
magnanimous
conduct
he
sent
for
other
thousands
to
be
sacrificed
to
gratify
his
arrogance
and
ambition
he
contrives
new
plans
to
pass
the
vistula
it
was
not
enough
to
have
covered
four
palatinates
with

himself
could
have
reigned
in
tranquillity
by
only
having
been
just
and
good
in
the
execution
of
this
plan
of
destruction
he
was
arrested
and
justly
punished
upon
the
glorious
days
of
the
of
march
and
the
of
april
which
in
conjunction
with
the
recent
revolutions
in
lithuania
and
samogitia
and
the
recent
battle
of
iganie
seemed
to
threaten
the
ruin
of
his
army
the
russian
army
was
now
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
disaffection
being
posted
in
a
devastated
country
and
having
their
resources
for
subsistence
entirely
cut
off
by
the
state
of
lithuania
and
samogitia
in
addition
to
their
immense
losses
in
action
fatigue
sickness
and
other
inconveniences
had
reduced
them
to
a
state
of
extreme
distress
besides
the
influence
of
physical
evils
there
was
a
moral
influence
which
impaired
their
strength
arising
from
a
conviction
which
they
could
not
avoid
feeling
of
the
justice
of
the
polish
cause
the
russian
soldiers
began
also
to
reflect
that
by
thus
serving
the
ends
of
despotism
they
were
only
securing
the
continuance
of
their
own
servitude
these
reflections
were
not
made
by
the
army
alone
but
as
we
were
secretly
advised
by
persons
coming
from
the
interior
of
russia
they
were
made
there
also
and
were
accompanied
with
the
same
sentiments
of
discontent
at
st
petersburgh
as
well
as
at
moscow
various
discontents
were
manifested
and
notices
of
such
must
have
met
the
eye
of
the
reader
in
the
journals
of
the
day
the
senate
of
st
petersburgh
presented
to
the
consideration
of
the
monarch
the
continual
severe
losses
of
the
preceding
years
in
the
wars
with
persia
and
turkey
and
those
of
this
campaign
though
much
underrated
by
them
which
they
had
reason
to
fear
would
be
still
increased
and
which
might
encourage
revolutions
in
all
the
provinces
for
these
reasons
the
senate
took
upon
themselves
to
advise
some
propitiatory
measures
and
some
attempt
by
concessions
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
the
poles
the
party
most
zealous
in
favor
of
such
a
course
was
composed
of
those
who
had
relations
and
friends
exiled
to
siberia
on
account
of
the
revolutionary
movement
of
the
russian
patriots
in
general
not
only
thought
it
a
favorable
moment
to
attempt
to
effect
an
amelioration
of
the
fate
of
those
individuals
but
they
hoped
that
the
restoration
of
their
ancient
constitutional
privileges
and
nationality
to
the
polish
provinces
attached
to
russia
would
authorize
a
claim
for
equal
privileges
to
the
people
of
the
whole
russian
empire
to
these
circumstances
is
to
be
added
that
at
this
time
the
other
cabinets
began
to
feel
dissatisfied
at
the
course
of
russia
and
decidedly
refused
the
requests
of
aid
in
men
and
money
which
she
made
on
the
pretext
of
former
treaties
every
thing
in
fine
seemed
to
promise
a
near
end
of
the
present
difficulties
the
polish
army
to
whom
this
state
of
things
was
well
known
waited
impatiently
for
the
moment
of
a
decisive
contest
one
victory
more
and
the
russians
would
not
be
in
a
state
to
push
their
attempts
farther
nothing
could
then
stop
the
progress
of
our
arms
which
would
rest
on
the
borders
of
the
dnieper
the
only
frontier
known
to
our
ancestors
one
struggle
more
and
the
darkness
of
ages
which
had
hung
over
the
polish
provinces
of
the
north
would
be
dispersed
the
light
of
civilization
would
then
spread
its
rays
as
far
as
the
ural
mountains
and
with
that
civilization
a
new
happiness
would
cheer
those
immense
regions
upon
the
borders
of
the
dnieper
fraternal
nations
would
hold
out
their
hands
towards
us
and
there
would
be
made
the
great
appeal
why
all
this
misery
the
poles
wish
to
deprive
you
of
nothing
nay
they
have
even
sacrificed
their
children
for
your
good
russians
awake
to
a
sense
of
your
condition
you
like
us
are
only
the
unhappy
victims
of
the
relentless
will
of
those
who
find
their
account
in
oppressing
you
and
us
let
us
end
this
struggle
caused
by
despotism
alone
let
it
be
our
common
aim
to
rid
ourselves
of
its
cruel
power
it
is
despotism
alone
that
we
have
any
interest
in
fighting
against
let
us
mark
these
frontiers
which
so
much
fraternal
blood
has
been
shed
to
regain
by
monuments
that
shall
tell
posterity
that
here
ended
forever
the
contest
between
brothers
which
shall
recall
the
disasters
that
despotism
has
caused
and
be
a
memorial
of
eternal
friendship
between
us
and
of
eternal
warning
to
tyranny
a
comparative
view
of
the
force
of
the
two
armies
after
the
battle
of
iganie
the
russian
forces
which
commenced
the
contest
on
the
of
december
amounted
as
has
been
before
stated
to
about
men
and
pieces
of
cannon
that
army
received
two
reinforcements
viz
the
corps
of
general
prince
szachowski
consisting
of
men
and
pieces
of
cannon
and
the
corps
of
the
imperial
guard
consisting
also
of
men
and
pieces
of
cannon
the
whole
russian
force
then
which
had
fought
against
us
amounted
to
men
and
pieces
of
cannon
to
act
against
this
force
our
army
counting
the
reinforcements
of
men
which
it
received
before
the
battle
of
grochow
had
in
service
about
men
and
about
pieces
of
cannon
up
to
the
battle
of
iganie
fifteen
principal
battles
had
been
given
viz
those
of
stoczek
dobre
milosna
swierza
and
nowawies
bialolenka
on
the
and
grochow
on
the
and
nasielsk
pulawy
kurow
wawr
on
the
and
and
iganie
to
these
are
to
be
added
a
great
number
of
small
skirmishes
in
not
one
of
which
could
it
have
been
said
that
the
russians
were
successful
by
their
own
official
reports
after
the
battle
of
grochow
more
than
fifty
thousand
russians
were
du
it
will
not
then
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
their
whole
loss
taking
into
the
account
prisoners
and
those
who
fell
under
the
ravages
of
the
cholera
which
had
begun
to
extend
itself
in
their
army
must
have
amounted
to
between
and
men
from
the
enormous
park
of
artillery
which
the
russians
had
brought
against
us
they
lost
as
many
as
sixty
pieces
it
may
then
be
presumed
that
the
russian
army
remained
at
between
and
men
and
about
pieces
of
cannon
not
estimating
however
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
do
the
number
of
cannon
which
might
have
been
dismounted
our
army
which
was
reorganized
at
warsaw
after
its
losses
was
brought
to
about
the
same
state
as
at
the
commencement
of
the
war
that
is
about
strong
the
artillery
was
now
augmented
to
pieces
although
the
enemy
force
was
still
sufficiently
imposing
the
reader
will
permit
me
to
say
and
in
fact
we
did
reasonably
calculate
thus
that
as
we
had
fought
with
such
success
against
the
enemy
in
his
unimpaired
strength
we
might
with
confidence
promise
ourselves
a
certain
issue
of
the
conflict
in
our
favor
when
with
his
forces
thus
diminished
in
numbers
sick
discouraged
and
discontented
we
could
meet
him
with
the
same
and
even
a
stronger
force
than
that
with
which
we
had
already
been
victorious
animated
too
as
we
now
were
by
the
inspiriting
influence
of
our
past
success
and
aided
by
the
terror
with
which
our
arms
had
inspired
the
enemy

every
military
reader
who
shall
follow
with
strict
attention
the
plans
of
our
general
in
strategy
and
tactics
will
be
astonished
perhaps
that
after
such
victories
as
those
of
the
of
march
and
of
april
he
should
have
abandoned
the
advantages
which
he
might
have
gained
in
following
up
immediately
his
operations
upon
the
two
corps
of
rosen
and
giesmar
and
then
throwing
himself
rapidly
upon
the
superior
forces
of
diebitsch
which
after
those
corps
were
cut
off
could
by
a
simultaneous
diversion
upon
zelechow
and
lukow
have
been
attacked
on
both
sides
and
thrown
into
confusion
although
i
can
not
give
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
this
apparent
fault
it
must
be
considered
that
those
subsequent
events
which
give
a
color
to
the
imputation
could
not
perhaps
have
then
been
reasonably
anticipated
by
the
general
and
the
talent
so
uniformly
displayed
by
skrzynecki
should
force
us
to
suppose
that
there
were
some
conclusive
objections
to
such
a
course
occurring
to
his
mind
which
are
not
now
apparent
to
the

who
directed

of
reconstructing
these

in
person
the
general
and
his

all
labored
with

a

footnote
i
can
not
pretend
to
give
the
reader
an
accurate
idea
of
the
number
of
prisoners
which
were
taken
during
the
first
days
of
april
from
the
battle
of
wawr
to
that
of
iganie
not
a
day
passed
in
which
great
numbers
of
them
with
baggage
and
effects
of
all
kinds
were
not
brought
in
they
must
have
amounted
in
that
interval
to
full
those
prisoners
arrived
generally
without
escort
and
it
was
often
the
case
that
old
men
and
even
women
of
the
peasantry
were
seen
leading
them
or
rather
showing
them
the
way
two
or
three
peasants
perhaps
with
twenty
prisoners
this
continual
influx
of
prisoners
gave
a
name
in
fact
to
that
interval
of
time
which
was
referred
to
as
period
of
the
prisoners
the
inhabitants
of
warsaw
found
an
amusement
in
witnessing
this
continual
arrival
of
the
captured
russians
us
go
to
praga
to
see
the
prisoners
brought
in
was
a
proposition
often
made
as
referring
to
an
ordinary
recreation
which
might
be
counted
on
with
perfect
certainty
if
for
a
half
day
no
prisoners
appeared
the
complaint
would
be
sportively
made
is
mr
john
about
referring
to
skrzynecki
that
he
sends
us
no
prisoners
the
great
number
of
the
prisoners
engaged
the
attention
of
the
national
government
it
was
impossible
to
leave
them
all
at
warsaw
and
they
were
at
first
divided
into
three
parts
one
of
which
remained
in
warsaw
to
work
upon
the
fortifications
and
every
soldier
was
paid
for
his
labor
the
second
part
being
also
employed
upon
wages
labored
on
the
great
roads
leading
from
warsaw
in
a
direction
opposite
to
the
seat
of
the
war
the
third
part
were
dispersed
among
the
farmers
in
the
proportion
of
one
russian
for
three
farmers
and
these
were
also
paid
for
their
labor
at
stated
times
an
assemblage
of
the
prisoners
was
held
in
which
they
were
addressed
in
such
a
manner
as
to
produce
a
moral
effect
upon
them
they
were
instructed
in
the
true
nature
of
their
political
rights
the
real
causes
of
the
contest
were
exhibited
to
them
and
they
were
made
to
be
convinced
that
it
was
for
their
advantage
as
well
as
our
own
that
we
were
fighting
the
greatest
harmony
reigned
between
the
poles
and
their
prisoners
and
i
am
sure
that
those
russians
will
remember
the
days
they
passed
as
prisoners
as
the
happiest
in
their
lives
with
us
their
prison
was
a
state
of
freedom
and
tranquillity
in
which
they
received
a
liberal
reward
for
their
labor

in

thirdly
at

was
the
imperial
guard
consisting
of
men
and

fourthly
in

were
the
combined
corps
of
witt
and
kreutz
consisting
of
men
and
pieces
of
cannon
their
different
scattered
detachments
might
be
counted
at
men
this

of

corps
invited

either
before
it
could
receive

from

composed

surrounded

in

still
farther
at

that
battle
in
fine
the
approach
to
praga
was
so
defended
that
the
enemy
before
reaching
it
would
have
to
pass
three
different
lines
of
fortification
the
general
in
chief
gave
instructions
to
the
governor
of
warsaw
in
regard
to
the
defence
of
the
city
in
which
he
placed
his
chief
trust
upon
the
national
guard
the
guard
counted
it
an
honor
to
be
entrusted
with
this
duty
and
were
unwilling
that
a
single
soldier
of
the
regular
army
should
be
detailed
for
the
service
how
admirably
they
executed
their
noble
resolutions
when
the
occasion
came
is
probably
well
known
to
every
reader
after
his
plans
for
the
defence
of
warsaw
were
communicated
to
the
authorities
of
the
city
he
gave
particular
attention
to
those
points
on
which
he
intended
to
support
all
his
operations
and
relying
on
which
he
could
at
any
time
hazard
the
boldest
attempts
having
thus
made
warsaw
an
axis
upon
which
all
his
operations
could
revolve
he
proceeded
to
arrange
his
attack
in
the
first
place
he
sent
orders
to
general
dwernicki
to
attack
immediately
the
combined
corps
of
generals
witt
and
kreutz
in
this
attack
the
small
corps
of
general
sierawski
was
to
aid
and
the
two
corps
were
to
preserve
a
constant
communication
with
each
other
for
that
object
general
sierawski
was
to
pass
the
vistula
at
kazimierz
and
avoiding
an
engagement
with
the
enemy
to
endeavor
to
join
as
soon
as
possible
the
corps
of
general
dwernicki
who
received
orders
to
leave
zamosc
and
approach
lublin
these
two
corps
were
to
take
such
a
position
that
they
could
at
any
time
retire
upon
zamosc
or
kazimierz
general
dwernicki
was
also
informed
that
a
third
small
corps
would
be
sent
in
the
direction
of
zelechow
and
kock
to
act
in
concert
with
him
on
the
enemy
rear
if
they
should
succeed
in
the
attack
general
dwernicki
was
to
endeavor
to
force
the
enemy
to
take
the
direction
of
pulawy
to
drive
him
into
the
angle
formed
by
the
vistula
v
and
the
wieprz
p
in
fine
so
to
act
as
to
cut
off
those
two
corps
from
all
communication
whatever
with
their
main
body
leaving
the
corps
of
general
sierawski
to
continue
to
observe
them
and
to
push
his
advantages
over
them
dwernicki
himself
was
to
pass
the
wieprz
at
kock
and
from
thence
by
forced
marches
to
leave
in
the
direction
of
radzyn
for
lukow
or
seroczyn
as
circumstances
might
direct
and
according
as
he
should
ascertain
the
position
of
the
enemy
to
be
arrived
at
lukow
or
seroczyn
as
the
case
might
be
he
was
to
await
there
the
orders
of
the
general
in
chief
to
join
in
the
attack
upon
the
main
force
of
the
enemy
under
diebitsch
in
which
attack
he
was
to
act
on
the
enemy
left
wing
the
main
body
of
the
enemy
thus
taken
in
front
and
in
flank
simultaneously
could
not
but
have
been
broken
up
for
all
these
operations
the
general
in
chief
had
destined
fourteen
days
only
on
the
night
of
the
battle
of
iganie
the
general
in
chief
having
decided
upon
the
above
plan
sent
officers
in
every
direction
with
orders
and
instructions
the
officers
sent
to
the
corps
of
general
dwernicki
were
enjoined
to
communicate
their
orders
to
him
with
the
utmost
haste
the
generalissimo
while
making
his
preparations
for
this
last
blow
continued
an
unremitting
observation
upon
all
the
movements
of
the
enemy
even
to
the
minutest
details
and
in
order
that
the
enemy
might
be
constantly
occupied
and
diverted
from
suspecting
our
plans
he
directed
small
attacks
to
be
continually
made
upon
his
front
for
this
object
the
second
division
posted
at
siennica
received
orders
to
advance
to
the
small
town
of
jeruzalem
the
division
in
executing
that
order
fought
the
enemy
for
three
successive
days
the
and
of
april
at
jedlina
wodynie
and
plomieniece
and
always
with
advantage
in
one
of
those
attacks
at
jedlina
a
small
detachment
of
sixteen
krakus
attacked
a
squadron
of
russian
hussars
coming
from
wodynie
dispersed
them
and
took
some
twenty
prisoners
this
division
received
also
the
order
to
communicate
constantly
with
the
corps
of
general
pac
at
zelechow
this
last
general
was
to
send
continual
reconnoissances
towards
kock
to
keep
a
constant
observation
upon
the
russian
corps
of
kreutz
and
witt
of
the
movements
of
those
two
corps
the
generalissimo
was
each
day
to
receive
the
most
accurate
information
in
order
to
be
ready
prepared
to
prevent
at
any
moment
a
junction
which
might
be
attempted
between
those
corps
and
their
main
body
general
skrzynecki
seeing
that
the
enemy
had
fallen
into
his
plan
of
which
indeed
he
could
not
have
had
the
least
suspicion
and
full
of
the
brightest
hopes
waited
impatiently
in
his
strong
position
for
intelligence
from
general
dwernicki
and
the
approach
of
the
moment
for
his
attack
upon
diebitsch
almost
sure
of
the
successful
execution
of
his
admirable
arrangements
what
can
express
his
disappointment
on
hearing
of
the
unfortunate
operations
of
the
corps
of
general
sierawski
and
of
the
defeat
of
that
corps
at
kazimierz
in
the
palatinate
of
lublin
first
defeat
in
the
whole
that
general
in
neglecting
the
instructions
of
the
commander
in
chief
not
to
engage
with
the
enemy
on
account
of
the
inferiority
of
his
own
forces
with
which
forces
in
fact
he
could
not
expect
to
act
but
in
partizan
warfare
approached
lublin
where
the
two
corps
of
kreutz
and
witt
were
supposed
to
be
posted
while
his
orders
were
by
avoiding
those
corps
and
taking
the
most
circuitous
roads
to
endeavor
to
join
as
secretly
and
as
soon
as
possible
the
corps
of
dwernicki
he
was
probably
deceived
by
false
information
as
to
the
direction
of
the
enemy
corps
and
led
to
believe
that
those
two
corps
had
quitted
lublin
to
attack
general
dwernicki
at
zamosc
he
therefore
probably
took
the
direction
of
lublin
with
the
idea
of
acting
upon
the
rear
of
the
enemy
at
the
moment
of
his
attack
upon
dwernicki
in
this
manner
general
sierawski
quitting
kazimierz
arrived
on
the
of
april
at
belzyca
to
his
great
astonishment
he
found
there
a
strong
advanced
guard
of
the
above
mentioned
corps
to
avoid
compromitting
himself
he
engaged
with
this
advanced
guard
when
observing
the
very
superior
force
and
the
advantageous
position
of
the
enemy
he
ordered
a
retreat
which
retreat
was
well
executed
and
without
much
loss
this
general
should
have
continued
his
march
the
whole
night
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
in
order
to
repass
quietly
the
vistula
and
thus
be
protected
from
all
molestation
by
the
enemy
but
for
what
cause
it
is
almost
impossible
to
conjecture
he
awaited
the
enemy
in
order
of
battle
the
next
day
at
serauow
perhaps
finding
himself
in
rather
a
strong
position
he
thought
that
the
corps
of
general
dwernicki
might
arrive
to
his
aid
the
enemy
approached
the
next
day
with
his
whole
force
against
sierawski
and
as
warm
an
action
commenced
as
the
nature
of
the
ground
would
admit
it
being
covered
by
woods
with
patches
of
open
ground
intervening
some
squadrons
of
young
kaliszian
cavalry
led
by
the
general
himself
advanced
to
the
attack
of
the
artillery
which
being
disadvantageously
posted
was
exposed
to
be
captured
that
cavalry
however
by
a
false
direction
of
their
charge
fell
among
the
concealed
masses
of
the
enemy
infantry
and
their
attack
failed
this
unsuccessful
attack
had
unfortunate
results
the
corps
of
general
sierawski
was
obliged
to
evacuate
its
position
and
along
its
whole
retrograde
march
continual
attacks
of
the
enemy
were
pressed
upon
it
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
ground
and
the
extreme
brevity
of
general
sierawski
a
veteran
of
between
sixty
and
seventy
who
at
the
head
of
the
detachments
of
his
rear
guard
always
led
the
charges
against
the
enemy
and
held
him
in
check
was
all
that
saved
the
corps
from
destruction
at
length
the
corps
reached
kazimierz
the
point
which
it
had
left
and
here
again
instead
of
passing
the
vistula
sierawski
awaited
another
attack
from
the
overwhelming
force
of
the
enemy
and
that
too
with
only
the
half
of
his
corps
for
the
other
half
was
sent
to
pass
the
vistula
this
course
was
inexplicable
and
excited
much
remark
in
the
army
on
the
the
russians
reached
kazimierz
the
town
was
vigorously
attacked
by
them
and
their
assaults
were
repeatedly
repulsed
by
the
new
kazimierz
infantry
under
colonel
malachowski
who
with
a
scythe
in
his
hand
marched
at
their
head
but
the
death
of
that
brave
patriot
spread
among
the
ranks
of
those
new
soldiers
a
degree
of
disorder
and
the
city
was
taken
by
the
enemy
we
must
again
thank
general
sierawski
for
having
saved
the
rest
of
the
corps
from
ruin
having
executed
the
evacuation
of
the
town
with
such
order
that
he
passed
the
vistula
at
the
point
of
borowa
not
far
from
kazimierz
without
being
molested
in
the
attempt
he
then
took
a
position
on
the
left
bank
although
the
unfortunate
affairs
of
those
two
days
were
not
attended
by
severe
losses
yet
they
were
deeply
afflictive
to
the
general
in
chief
they
threatened
the
entire
disarrangement
of
his
plans
and
were
followed
by
the
more
important
disasters
of
general
dwernicki
the
latter
general
who
as
is
known
to
the
reader
commenced
his
career
so
gloriously
whose
very
name
indeed
was
a
terror
to
the
russians
and
who
by
his
successive
victories
over
the
three
corps
of
kreutz
wirtemberg
and
rudiger
had
established
the
strongest
claims
upon
the
gratitude
of
his
country
this
general
i
must
repeat
it
with
pain
finished
his
great
career
in
the
most
unfortunate
manner
his
case
should
serve
as
a
strong
example
that
it
is
not
bravery
alone
which
is
required
in
a
great
general
for
in
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
his
equal
but
that
this
bravery
loses
its
value
when
not
united
with
circumspection
the
following
are
the
details
of
the
operations
of
general
dwernicki
plan
xxiii
we
can
not
well
imagine
the
cause
which
induced
that
general
to
quit
zamosc
and
the
important
operations
in
the
palatinate
of
lublin
and
neglecting
all
his
instructions
and
orders
to
have
crossed
the
bug
b
and
entered
the
province
of
volhynia
unless
it
were
the
reception
of
some
certain
news
of
a
fresh
insurrection
in
that
province
and
of
the
collection
of
insurgent
forces
there
who
might
be
waiting
for
his
approach
and
who
needed
his
protection
he
might
perhaps
have
thought
to
be
able
so
to
accelerate
his
movement
as
to
avail
himself
of
such
new
strength
before
a
superior
russian
force
should
arrive
in
that
province
to
crush
such
insurrection
and
disperse
the
insurgents
at
the
moment
when
dwernicki
might
have
conceived
such
a
plan
there
was
in
fact
only
a
corps
of
about
men
and
some
pieces
of
cannon
under
rudiger
in
the
province
this
corps
dwernicki
perhaps
intended
to
attack
in
his
way
and
crush
them
and
then
attaching
the
insurgents
to
his
corps
to
return
to
the
palatinate
or
if
circumstances
might
make
it
expedient
to
follow
up
his
blow
into
the
heart
of
volhynia
in
fine
on
the
of
april
this
general
quitted
the
environs
of
zamosc
taking
the
direction
of
uscilog
where
on
the
evening
of
the
he
passed
the
river
bug
on
the
he
continued
his
march
in
the
direction
of
dubno
where
the
insurgents
were
perhaps
supposed
to
be
awaiting
him
on
the
road
to
that
town
he
received
information
that
the
corps
of
rudiger
had
marched
from
radziwilow
and
was
now
in
the
direction
of
milatyn
general
dwernicki
turned
immediately
from
the
direction
in
which
he
was
marching
to
throw
himself
upon
this
corps
which
he
found
on
its
march
at
the
village
of
boromel
where
without
giving
the
enemy
time
to
take
position
he
attacked
and
overthrew
him
the
enemy
was
routed
and
lost
several
hundred
in
killed
and
prisoners
with
eight
pieces
of
cannon
that
in
this
fine
and
the
last
fine
battle
of
dwernicki
the
russian
corps
was
not
wholly
destroyed
was
owing
to
the
circumstance
that
a
branch
of
the
river
styr
s
over
which
the
bridge
had
been
destroyed
stopped
our
pursuit
the
russians
during
the
night
of
the
evacuated
their
position
and
took
the
road
to
beresteczko
where
they
took
a
new
position
in
regard
to
tactics
the
corps
of
general
rudiger
could
not
have
chosen
a
worse
direction
than
that
of
the
angle
formed
by
the
river
styr
and
the
frontier
of
austria
f
general
dwernicki
by
a
passage
to
the
right
bank
of
the
styr
could
have
cut
off
all
the
enemy
communications
with
his
other
corps
and
could
have
again
fought
him
at
the
greatest
advantage
it
was
here
then
that
our
brave
dwernicki
committed
his
great
fault
and
in
place
of
acting
upon
the
right
bank
of
the
river
where
he
would
have
had
an
open
field
for
the
most
enlarged
operations
he
chose
to
follow
up
the
attack
and
as
he
saw
that
the
enemy
could
not
be
safely
assailed
in
front
on
account
of
his
strong
position
between
two
small
lakes
but
found
that
this
position
was
open
towards
the
frontier
of
austria
there
it
was
that
the
unhappy
idea
occurred
to
him
of
marching
to
the
environs
of
kolodno
on
the
frontier
of
austria
and
attacking
the
enemy
on
that
side
feeling
sure
of
victory
but
general
rudiger
did
not
wait
for
this
attack
perceiving
his
exposed
position
between
the
river
and
the
frontier
he
was
satisfied
with
being
permitted
to
escape
and
declined
battle
upon
observing
that
general
dwernicki
was
manoeuvring
upon
the
frontiers
of
austria
general
rudiger
repassed
the
styr
avoided
the
attack
by
this
manoeuvre
and
was
in
a
situation
to
join
himself
with
all
the
russian
detachments
which
might
come
into
the
province
from
the
heart
of
russia
by
the
different
directions
of
krzemieniece
ostrog
c
and
to
act
with
them
in
surrounding
dwernicki
who
was
confined
in
this
above
described
angle
this
is
what
in
fact
took
place
dwernicki
remained
for
what
reason
we
can
not
conceive
at
kolodno
until
the
of
april
whence
following
along
the
frontiers
of
austria
he
took
the
direction
of
wereszczaki
there
dispersing
a
russian
detachment
he
arrived
on
the
at
knielce
and
wielkie
knowing
that
the
russians
were
observing
him
he
determined
to
remain
there
and
take
advantage
of
a
strong
natural
position
he
wished
in
this
position
to
await
the
enemy
and
give
him
battle
hoping
by
a
victory
to
free
himself
from
the
contracted
space
in
which
he
was
confined
in
fact
on
the
next
day
the
corps
of
general
rudiger
made
its
appearance
having
come
in
the
direction
of
krzemienic
the
battle
commenced
and
in
the
midst
of
the
action
another
russian
corps
was
seen
approaching
in
the
direction
of
proskirow
and
under
the
command
of
general
rott
acting
thus
upon
the
right
wing
and
even
the
rear
of
general
corps
to
avoid
being
turned
general
dwernicki
retired
in
such
a
manner
as
to
lean
his
right
wing
upon
the
austrian
frontier
the
russians
not
regarding
this
passed
that
frontier
and
proceeded
to
push
their
attack
upon
his
flank
this
obliged
general
dwernicki
to
withdraw
his
left
wing
and
indeed
his
whole
front
upon
the
austrian
territory
where
in
fact
the
line
was
not
distinctly
marked
all
the
while
being
engaged
with
the
enemy
the
action
having
continued
thus
for
some
hours
a
detachment
of
austrian
cavalry
under
colonel
fac
approached
and
threw
themselves
between
the
combatants
calling
on
them
to
respect
the
neutrality
of
the
territory
in
this
manner
the
combat
ceased
general
dwernicki
gave
his
parole
to
discontinue
hostilities
and
consented
to
advance
farther
into
the
interior
and
placing
himself
in
camp
waited
the
result
of
the
decision
of
the
austrian
government
upon
what
had
occurred
the
russian
corps
which
had
just
passed
the
frontier
and
which
had
in
fact
entered
it
with
its
whole
force
was
permitted
to
leave
freely
the
first
duty
which
general
dwernicki
thought
imposed
upon
him
in
his
present
situation
was
to
make
a
full
and
true
report
of
what
had
occurred
to
the
national
government
and
the
general
in
chief
which
he
was
permitted
to
do
he
also
sent
a
letter
to
the
commander
in
chief
of
the
austrian
forces
in
gallicia
explaining
how
it
was
that
in
a
necessary
manoeuvre
he
had
passed
over
a
point
of
land
on
the
austrian
territory
without
the
intention
of
occupying
it
having
done
this
he
supposed
that
he
would
be
permitted
to
remain
in
camp
retaining
his
own
arms
those
taken
from
the
enemy
and
his
prisoners
until
conferences
between
the
governments
should
decide
respecting
the
course
to
be
taken
but
the
austrian
government
far
from
giving
such
a
reasonable
permission
collected
a
strong
corps
in
the
environs
of
tarnopol
and
the
austrian
commander
in
chief
demanded
of
general
dwernicki
to
surrender
both
his
own
arms
and
those
taken
from
the
enemy
general
dwernicki
although
this
austrian
corps
was
not
formidable
to
him
yet
being
anxious
to
avoid
the
serious
political
consequences
which
might
possibly
follow
resistance
submitted
to
this
unjust
demand
which
will
be
an
eternal
reproach
to
the
austrian
government
the
austrians
returned
their
arms
to
the
russian
prisoners
whom
they
liberated
and
retained
the
arms
of
the
polish
troops
the
whole
corps
was
conducted
into
the
interior
and
thus
ended
the
career
of
that
important
body
of
our
forces
the
conduct
of
austria
in
regard
to
the
corps
of
dwernicki
i
am
sure
will
excite
the
indignation
of
the
reader
if
general
dwernicki
had
entered
upon
the
austrian
territory
he
was
forced
to
do
it
by
the
russian
corps
which
had
already
passed
the
frontier
and
that
can
not
be
regarded
as
an
intentional
invasion
of
the
frontiers
which
was
done
without
design
and
was
a
mere
transition
over
an
indistinct
line
made
necessary
by
the
position
which
the
enemy
had
taken
such
a
case
certainly
should
have
formed
an
exception
to
a
general
rule
to
the
russian
corps
all
the
prisoners
were
returned
without
any
consent
obtained
from
our
government
to
whom
they
in
fact
belonged
and
should
have
been
considered
as
belonging
until
the
end
of
the
war
it
was
in
this
manner
that
those
intriguing
cabinets
repaid
the
debt
of
gratitude
which
they
owed
to
poland
they
had
forgotten
the
times
of
john
sobieski
who
in
delivered
their
capital
and
their
whole
territory
from
destruction
at
the
hands
of
the
turks
they
had
forgotten
that
they
thus
owe
their
very
existence
to
poland
at
present
regardless
of
all
obligations
of
justice
they
concert
with
our
enemy
for
our
ruin
but
if
by
this
unjust
treatment
of
their
benefactors
the
austrians
may
have
gained
some
temporary
advantages
the
reader
will
acknowledge
that
in
reference
to
their
ultimate
good
they
have
acted
with
a
most
and
mistaken
policy
the
aggrandizement
of
russia
can
never
be
an
advantage
to
austria
there
were
few
more
melancholy
events
in
our
war
than
this
the
disaster
of
this
corps
grievously
paralyzed
all
the
fine
plans
of
the
general
in
chief
it
reinforced
the
russian
superior
force
by
men
for
the
different
corps
of
kreutz
witt
rudiger
and
rott
could
now
rejoin
their
main
army
without
obstruction
to
these
disasters
of
the
two
corps
of
dwernicki
and
sierawski
which
were
deeply
felt
by
the
nation
was
now
to
be
added
the
appearance
of
that
horrible
malady
the
cholera
which
after
the
battle
of
iganie
commenced
its
devastations
in
our
ranks
on
the
night
of
that
battle
several
hundreds
of
our
troops
fell
sick
this
terrible
disease
caused
us
on
the
first
few
days
the
loss
of
nearly
men
but
if
it
was
terrible
with
us
nothing
can
express
the
suffering
it
produced
in
the
russian
camp
aided
by
the
want
of
comfort
in
the
arrangements
of
that
camp
and
the
acid
food
upon
which
the
russian
soldiers
were
habitually
fed
thousands
of
those
wretched
sufferers
were
left
exposed
to
the
open
air
and
died
upon
the
field
the
poles
took
even
more
care
of
them
than
of
their
own
sick
they
were
brought
together
and
transported
to
menie
where
there
was
a
large
convent
which
was
turned
into
an
hospital
for
their
use
the
total
number
of
those
sufferers
may
be
imagined
when
it
is
stated
that
in
that
hospital
and
village
alone
two
thousand
russian
sick
were
reported
footnotes
footnote
this
unfortunate
and
painful
event
should
serve
as
an
impressive
example
which
can
not
be
too
often
brought
to
mind
of
what
disastrous
consequences
may
follow
from
the
neglect
of
observing
a
constant
communication
between
corps
acting
together
and
above
all
the
departing
from
orders
which
are
given
upon

plan
the
absolute
control
of
which
should
belong
to

general
in

had
general
dwernicki
conforming

instructions
acted
only
against
the
corps
of
kreutz

witt
and
in
concert
with
the
corps
of
sierawski
he
would
have
been
apprised
of
that
general
quitting
kazimierz
and
both
of
those
two
corps
could
have
joined
in
the
attack
in

they
would
have

by
another
corps

act
against
the

those

immense
advantages

have
followed
indeed
the

the

which
since
the
last
of
march
had
been
on
the
defensive
from
weakness
or
from
indecision
on
the
of
april
began
to
change
its
position
and
to
take
the
offensive
having
received
intelligence
as
we
may
suppose
of
the
disasters
of
sierawski
and
also
of
the
passage
of

dwernicki

to
pass
the

was
forced
to
retire
on
the
same
day
the
brigade
of
colonel
dembinski
was
attacked
at
jeruzalem
without
any
decisive
result
those
small
attacks
by
the
enemy
served
however
as
an
indication
of
the
intention
of
general
diebitsch
to
take
the
offensive
on
a
larger
scale
to
meet
this
intention
all
our
detachments
received
orders
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
firstly
these
detachments
were
to
concentrate
themselves
upon
a
line
of
operations

and
zelechow
reader
can
refer
to
vi
the
whole
line
in
case
of
attack
on
whatever
quarter
it
might
be
was
to
make
a
retrograde
movement
upon

as
the
field
of
wawr
general
pac
in

who
was
the
farthest
removed
from

was
to
use
the
utmost
vigilance
and
to
make
this
retrograde
movement
in
the
promptest
manner
when
occasion
required
on
the
of

in
fact
marshal
diebitsch
commenced
his
attack
at
two
principal
points
boimie
and
kuflew
upon
the
last
of
these
two
points
he
threw
his
greatest
force
intending
to
pierce
our
line
there
and
by
a
diversion
at
minsk
to
divide
our
forces
besides
the
prevention
of
this
design
the
defence
of
kuflew
was
of
the
greatest
importance
to
us
from
the
circumstance
that
along
the
whole
course
of
the
river
swider
at
latowicz
starygrod
c
were
posted
various
small
detachments

would
have
been

this
combat
deserved

held
up

can
be

were
as

on
the
several
regiments
of
cossacks
appeared
upon
the
heights
of
jeruzalem
they
even
several
times
attempted
to
pass
the
dyke
but
were
repulsed
by
the
fire
of
our
tirailleurs
from
the
it
was
when
strong
columns
of
infantry
began
to
show
themselves
in
the
direction
of
lukowiec
and
plomieniec
in
a
short
time
all
the
heights
of
jeruzalem
were
covered
with
columns
of
infantry
and
they
began
their
descent
to

the
russian
light
troops
began
their
debouchment
and
a
warm
fire
commenced
between
the
russian
infantry
upon

dyke
and
our

tirailleurs

the
russian
artillery
which
remained
upon
the
heights
on
the
other
side
consisting
of
twenty
and
more
pieces
of
large
calibre
poured
for
several
hours
a
heavy
fire
upon
kuflew
where
they
supposed
a
large
force
to
be
placed
but
where
in
fact
besides
the
four
pieces
of
artillery
we
had
but
one
company
of
infantry
under
this
terrible
fire
that
village
was
burnt
to
the
ground
those
attacks
of
the
russian
artillery
and
infantry
continued
for
three
successive
hours
when
colonel
dembinski
being
informed
that
the
small
detachments
at
latowicz
c
above
referred
to
had
evacuated
their
position
and
were
safe
from
being
cut
off
commenced
his
retreat
as
his
instructions

accelerating
his
retreat
he
had
another
object
in

namely
to
lead
the
enemy
in
the
direction
of
the
division
which
was
posted
at
ceglow
and
was
prepared
to
receive
him
our
infantry
and
artillery
had
left
their
position
and
were
on
the
road
when
colonel
dembinski
placing
himself
at
the
head
of
his
cavalry
threw
himself
with
great
boldness
upon
the
columns
of
the
enemy
which
had
debouched
over
the
dyke
and
by
repeated
attacks
kept
them
off
from
our
rear
after
having
passed
the
first
forest
without
molestation
between
ceglow
and
kuflew
colonel
dembinski
took
a
position
between
forests
in
the
environs
of
bady
where
a
part
of
the
division
was
placed
in
expectation
of
the
enemy
in
a
kind
of
ambuscade
here
our
forces
waited
in
vain
until
night
for
the
enemy
who
had
contented
himself
with
having
taken
kuflew
two
squadrons
of
cossacks
whom
he
ventured
to
send
towards
our
position
to
reconnoitre
were
as
soon
as
they
were
seen
fallen
upon
by
our
cavalry
and
either
cut
down
or
made
prisoners
to
the
amount
of
more
than
a
hundred
men
and
horses
with
two
officers
as
the
enemy
attempted
nothing
more
our
forces
during
the
night
evacuated
their
position
agreeably
to
instructions
and
reached
minsk
at
of
the
next
day
at
kuflew
full
men
with
some
twenty
pieces
of
artillery

commanded
by
diebitsch
in
person
were
opposed
to
general
dembinski

had
not
quite
men
and
four
pieces
of
artillery
with
which
force
he
stood
against
the
enemy
for
that
whole
day
the
loss
of
the
russians
was
about
a
thousand
men
and
on
our
own
side
it
was
not

illustration
illustration
the
actions
which
took
place
on
the
same
day
at
boimie
were
without
any
decisive
result
consisting
only
of
a
continued
fire
of
artillery
during
the
night
of
that
day
our
forces
in
every
point
made
a
retrograde
movement
the
general
in
chief
arranged
his
preparations
to
receive
the
enemy
on
the
dividing
his
forces
into
two
parts
the
second
division
under
gielgud
and
the
division
of
cavalry
under
skarzynski
was
to
await
the
enemy
at
minsk
while
the
general
in
chief
with
the
main
body
awaited
him
in
person
at
battle
of
minsk
xxv
the
position
of
minsk
may
be
considered
as
one
of
the
strongest
upon
the
great
road
from
siedlce
to
warsaw
that
town
is
situated
in
a
plain
surrounded
by
an
impenetrable
forest
and
traversed
by
a
small
river
which
falls
into
the
swider
upon
the
side
of
warsaw
where
our
forces
were
placed
are
heights
which
overlook
the
whole
town
and
they
were
particularly
commanding
upon
the
right
of
the
roads
leading
to
warsaw
the
fire
from
those
heights
could
sweep
almost
every
street
of
the
city
and
they
were
occupied
by
pieces
of
artillery
upon
the
side
of
siedlce
and
ceglow
whence
the
enemy
was
approaching
the
whole
plain
was
exposed
to
the
commanding
fire
of
this
artillery
the
town
of
minsk
was
occupied
by
two
battalions
of
our
light
infantry
dispersed
as
sharp
shooters
it
was
when
the
russians
debouched
from
the
forest
commenced
their
advance
and
deployed
upon
the
plain
under
the
fire
of
our
artillery
which
was
opened
immediately
some
fifty
pieces
of
the
enemy
artillery
approached
the
city
took
position
and
commenced
their
fire
as
the
town
was
occupied
by
so
small
a
force
and
so
distributed
as
not
to
be
affected
by
the
enemy
fire
he
was
permitted
to
continue
this
fire
and
our
artillery
reserved
theirs
for
the
moment
when
he
should
make
a
general
advance
to
storm
the
town
this
soon
took
place
an
enormous
mass
of
infantry
advanced
to
the
assault
our
light
troops
evacuated
the
part
of
the
town
beyond
the
river
to
enable
our
artillery
to
open
upon
it
that
part
was
immediately
occupied
by
the
enemy
who
crowded
together
in
the
streets
were
subjected
to
a
fire
which
spread
death
among
their
ranks
the
enemy
hesitated
whether
to
advance
or
retire
and
remained
in
the
utmost
disorder
falling
under
the
fire
of
our
artillery
and
the
torn
and
burning
fragments
of
the
wooden
buildings
which
were
rent
in
pieces
by
that
fire
while
the
enemy
remained
in
this
horrible
suspense
the
brave
colonel
oborski
led
his
regiment
to
the
charge
and
bore
down
all
before
him
a
most
terrible
massacre
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
then
took
place
in
the
square
of
the
church
where
great
masses
of
the
enemy
were
crowded
together
the
russians
were
driven
out
of
the
town
after
a
most
severe
loss
they
were
left
at
liberty
to
take
possession
of
the
same
part
again
but
they
did
not
repeat
their
attacks
upon
the
town
satisfying
themselves
with
concentrating
a
heavy
fire
of
artillery
principally
upon
the
heights
occupied
by
our
own
this
state
of
things
continued
till
three
when
general
gielgud
gave
orders
to
evacuate
the
position
agreeably
to
the
directions
of
the
general
in
chief
sixteen
squadrons
of
cavalry
were
left
to
cover
the
movement
and
in
this
way
our
division
reaching
the
village
of
stoiadly
two
english
miles
distant
took
a
second
position
there
this
new
position
was
advantageous
on
account
of
the
elevation
of
the
ground
our
right
wing
in
particular
was
well
supported
upon
a
thick
marshy
forest
and
was
pushed
forward
far
enough
to
give
a
cross
fire
to
the
enemy
in
case
he
should
try
to
force
the
passage
of
the
great
road
as
the
enemy
was
so
imprudent
after
our
evacuation
as
to
commence
his
debouchment
through
the
town
with
his
cavalry
in
advance
he
exposed
himself
to
a
severe
loss
for
our
artillery
consisting
of
six
pieces
poured
a
destructive
fire
upon
the
main
street
of
the
city
which
led
to
the
only
passage
over
the
river
and
again
after
deploying
under
this
fire
upon
the
plain
he
was
subjected
to
vigorous
charges
from
our
cavalry
under
skarzynski
which
cost
him
a
severe
loss
and
delayed
his
advance
for
more
than
half
an
hour
as
the
space
between
stoiadly
and
minsk
was
a
plain
gently
descending
from
our
side
moist
in
the
lower
parts
and
in
every
way
favorable
for
attacks
by
our
cavalry
their
charges
were
continually
repeated
and
the
combat
on
this
plain
deserved
the
name
of
the
combat
of
cavalry
to
give
the
reader
an
idea
of
these
effective
charges
against
a
cavalry
of
much
superior
force
i
will
merely
state
that
each
squadron
of
the
sixteen
was
engaged
some
three
or
four
successive
times
with
the
enemy
their
horses
were
continually
in
foam
the
regiment
of
zamoyski
the
krakus
and
the
hulans
greatly
distinguished
themselves
the
loss
of
the
enemy
cavalry
of
which
the
greater
part
consisted
of
regiments
of
heavy
dragoons
was
very
great
their
horses
hoofs
sunk
into
the
humid
ground
and
our
krakus
on
their
light
animals
assaulted
them
in
the
very
midst
of
their
ranks
many
staff
and
other
officers
of
the
enemy
were
left
dead
upon
the
field
our
advanced
guard
having
in
this
way
fought
with
such
advantages
against
the
whole
russian
army
at
minsk
and
stoiadly
from
until
the
general
in
chief
ordered
them
to
evacuate
their
position
as
promptly
as
possible
and
retire
to
where
he
awaited
the
enemy
in
order
of
battle
and
where
he
was
desirous
of
meeting
his
attack
before
night
this
movement
was
executed
without
molestation
from
the
russians
our
advanced
guard
passed
the
forests
between
and
stoiadly
and
arrived
at
the
position
of
where
fifty
pieces
of
our
artillery
were
posted
to
receive
the
enemy
and
our
whole
force
took
the
order
of
battle
the
enemy
however
did
not
debouch
from
the
forests
but
remained
on
the
other
side
this
finishes
the
details
of
that
day
and
of
the
battle
of
minsk
in
which
the
early
cessation
of
the
attacks
of
the
enemy
proved
how
much
he
had
suffered
he
had
two
generals
mortally
wounded
general
pahlen
and
the
prince
galiczyn
and
lost
nearly
men
on
our
side
the
loss
was
four
or
five
hundred
only
for
their
conduct
in
this
battle
the
national
government
and
the
general
in
chief
presented
their
thanks
to
the
division
under
gielgud
and
the
division
of
cavalry
under
skarzynski
general
gielgud
was
advanced
to
the
rank
of
general
of
division
and
it
was
perhaps
owing
to
his
skilful
dispositions
and
brave
conduct
on
that
day
that
it
was
not
feared
to
entrust
him
with
the
command
of
the
all
important
expedition
to
lithuania
on
the
and
no
events
took
place
during
the
night
of
the
the
enemy
to
our
astonishment
evacuated
his
position
and
retired
as
far
as
kaluszyn
english
miles
distant
we
can
not
give
the
true
cause
of
this
sudden
and
unexpected
retreat
perhaps
it
was
on
account
of
a
failure
of
provisions
another
cause
might
have
been
the
rumors
which
had
begun
to
take
an
aspect
of
importance
of
the
revolutions
in
lithuania
and
samogitia
the
reader
will
allow
me
to
dwell
for
a
moment
upon
this
extraordinary
movement
of
the
enemy
which
must
be
considered
an
indication
either
of
the
extreme
of
physical
and
moral
weakness
to
which
the
russian
army
was
reduced
or
of
a
great
want
of
generalship
on
the
part
of
marshal
diebitsch
such
a
course
voluntarily
taken
in
the
eyes
of
the
military
critic
is
enough
to
destroy
all
claim
to
military
talent
on
the
part
of
that
commander
such
great
objects
attempted
followed
up
with
so
little
perseverance
and
abandoned
without
an
adequate
cause
would
seem
to
indicate
either
the
absence
of
any
fixed
plan
or
a
degree
of
indecision
inconsistent
with
any
sound
military
pretensions
our
commander
in
chief
felt
sure
that
when
general
diebitsch
attacked
on
the
and
it
was
with
the
view
having
no
longer
any
fear
of
the
corps
of
generals
dwernicki
and
sierawski
and
being
reinforced
by
the
corps
which
had
been
opposed
to
the
former
to
follow
up
his
attack
and
compel
us
to
a
general
battle
whatever
might
have
been
the
result
of
that
battle
it
was
the
only
course
which
a
true
general
could
have
followed
especially
when
his
army
was
in
such
superiority
of
strength
to
one
who
considers
these
circumstances
two
questions
will
arise
first
what
was
the
object
of
commencing
the
attack
secondly
what
was
in
regard
to
tactics
the
cause
of
its
cessation
and
of
that
sudden
retreat
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
find
a
satisfactory
answer
to
either
of
those
questions
our
army
after
this
retreat
of
the
enemy
commenced
anew
its
advance

on

part

our
general
in

decided
to
hostilities
by
small
attacks
which
were
designed
to
mask
the
great
plan
he
intended
to
put
into
execution
the
general
view
which
occupied
our
commander
was
to
continue
the
offensive
to
follow
up
the

not

made
a
vast
change
in

strength
of
the

the
fate
of

gave
a
great
advantage
to
the
enemy
leaving
him
free
to
concentrate
all
his
forces
and

act
in
one
mass
this
advantage
of
the
enemy
was
to
be
met
and
means
were
to
be
taken
to
keep
his
forces
in
detached
bodies
by
giving
occupation
to
each
to
provide
such
means
it
was
next
an
object
to
give
an
important
character
to
the
revolution
in

in

to
make
that
revolution
supply

approached
so
near
the

without
being
perceived
as
even
to
be
on

line
with
him
not
long
before
evening
romarino
having
reached
the
enemy
on
the

c
began
his
attack
and
his
fire
was
a
signal
for
chrzanowski
to
quit
the
forest
thus
suddenly
assaulted
upon
his
two
wings
and
his
rear
the
disorder
of
the
enemy
was
unimaginable
and
he
was
not
in
a
state
to
offer
resistance
the
whole
camp
was
taken
with
all
its
baggage
ammunition
c
and
as
many
as
two
thousand
prisoners

six
pieces

fled
along

purposely
left
open
to
him
general
chrzanowski
contented
himself
with
occupying
the
town
in
which
he
furnished
himself
with
ammunition
from
the
magazines
and
remaining
there
but
a
short
time
left
for
the
environs
of
zamosc
in

fortress
he
deposited
his
prisoners
conformably
to
his
instructions
he
remained
in

near
this
fortress
at

the
general

thus
accomplished
his
object
of
supplying
the
place
of

and
holding
in
check
the
corps
of

and
kreutz
in

it
remained
to
him
to
complete
his
great
plan
by
sending
a
corps
into
lithuania
he
decided
to
remove
the
only
obstacle
to
this
attempt
by
attacking
the
russian
imperial
guard
which
was
somewhat
detached
from
the
russian
grand

the

this

he
was
to
make
in

and
he
was
to
give
to
the
manoeuvre
the
aspect
of
a
reconnoissance
the
object
of
this
change
of
position
was
that
in
the
new
position
he
might
mask
the
movements
of
the
main
body
this
important
disposition
general
uminski
was
directed
to
carry
into
effect
with
the
utmost
prudence
the
enemy
was
to
be
each
day
harassed
but
never
to
be
engaged
with
in
any
decisive
manner
small
detachments
were
to
be
sent
against
the
enemy
along
his
whole
line
and
especially
on
the
first
days
of
the
movement
the
general
in

instructed
general
uminski
to
watch
every
movement
of
the
enemy
and
give
information
of
such
at
if
the
main
body
of
the
russian
force
should
make
an
attack
he
was
to
execute
his
retreat
upon
the
main

as
far
as
the
fortifications

there
he
was
to
act
in

the
other
detachments
left
there
for
the
defence
of
those
fortifications
if
on
the
contrary
the
russian
army
should
make
a
retrograde

general
uminski
was
to
endeavor
by
following
them
to
keep
them
constantly
in

if
circumstances
permitted
the

guard
of
the
russians

general
lubinski
and
the
detachments
left
at
siennica
and
karczew
in
this
moderate
pursuit
of
the
enemy
the
general
was
to
ascertain
whether
their
retrograde
movement
was
a
retreat
or
a
manoeuvre
in
order
to
avoid
every
hazard
general
lubinski
with
his
division
of

was
to
pass
the
right
bank
of
the

and
leaving
small
detachments
at
wyszkow
and
brok
he
was
to
advance
as
far
as
the
environs
of
nar
not
quitting
the
right
bank
of
the
river
all
his
care
was
to
be
devoted
to
the
observing
of
the
enemy
and
to
the
preventing
of
any
sudden
passage
of
the
river
by
him
in
regard
to
his
communications
the
same
instructions
were
given
to
him
as
to
general
uminski
having
given
these
orders
to
the
above
mentioned
corps
general
skrzynecki
with
the
main
force
left
suddenly
the
position
at
kaluszyn
making
a
retrograde
movement
upon
the

through
jablonna
and

arrived
on

on

he
passed
the

at
this
place
leaving
a
brigade
of
infantry
and
cavalry
under
general
dembinski
upon
the
right
bank
with
orders
to
advance
to
ostrolenka
through
the
towns
of
pultusk
magnuszewo
and
rozany
this
detachment
was
not
to
commence
the
attack
on
meeting
the
enemy
but
was
only
to
harass
him
and
keep
him
in
check
and
detain
him
as
near
as
possible
to
serock
if
the
enemy
should
commence
the
retreat
this
corps
was
to
pursue
him
with
the
greatest
activity
in
order
that
at
ostrolenka
where
the
general
in
chief
had
determined
to
attack
him
he
might
be
exposed
between
two
fires
on
the
this
corps
met
the
first
advanced
post
of
the
russian
imperial
guard
at
modzele
which
after
a
slight
engagement
evacuated
its
position
and
retired
being
pursued
by
the
brigade
of
cavalry
under
general
dembinski
they
on
the
commenced
the
passage
of
the
narew
at
ostrolenka
in
attempting
this
passage
the
of
the
enemy
was
overthrown
and
four
regiments
of
the
light
infantry
of
finland
were
taken
prisoners
this
pursuit
by
the
brave
dembinski
was
executed
with
such
rapidity
that
the
corps
of
general
saken
which
made
a
part
of
the
grand
corps
of
the
guard
but
was
a
little
detached
was
completely
cut
off
from
the
main
body
and
forced
to
take
refuge
in
the
palatinate
of
augustow
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
our
main
force
could
not
reach
ostrolenka
having
to
pass
narrow
roads
through
forests
in
which
the
artillery
met
with
much
obstruction
otherwise
the
whole
of
that
imperial
guard
would
have
been
surrounded
with
the
arrival
of
our
main
body
on
the
night
of
the
the
russians
passed
the
narew
but
many
voitures
and
stragglers
fell
into
the
hands
of
our
cavalry
in
the
forest
of
troszyn
the
general
in
chief
having
given
the
corps
a
short
rest
and
having
despatched
a
detachment
under
the
command
of
colonel
sierawski
for
the
pursuit
of
the
corps
of
saken
on
the
same
night
continued
his
march
in
pursuit
of
the
guard
in
the
direction
of
troszyn
on
the
morning
of
the
next
day
arriving
at
this
village
was
found
occupied
by
two
regiments
of
infantry
and
two
of
cavalry
the
latter
covering
the
village
our
regiment
of
lancers
which
were
the
leading
force
leaving
the
forest
and
finding
the
russian
cavalry
in
line
before
that
village
threw
themselves
upon
them
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
the
enemy
cavalry
was
borne
down
before
them
and
pursued
by
our
lancers
into
the
village
but
his
infantry
under
cover
of
the
village
opened
a
terrible
fire
upon
our
cavalry
which
compelled
them
to
retire
and
await
the
arrival
of
the
artillery
at
length
eight
pieces
of
light
artillery
commanded
by
colonel
boehm
arrived
and
commenced
a
vigorous
fire
of
grape
upon
the
village
which
compelled
the
infantry
to
evacuate
it
and
they
were
pursued
with
such
spirit
that
one
battalion
was
taken
and
the
rest
were
dispersed
in
the
forest
on
the
same
day
the
enemy
was
again
pressed
upon
in
his
retreat
in
the
environs
of
xienzopol
especially
on
the
passage
of
the
river
and
marshes
of
kamionka
the
lancers
and
the
battery
of
light
artillery
who
did
not
quit
the
enemy
a
moment
arrived
simultaneously
with
him
at
the
point
of
the
passage
the
enemy
was
obliged
to
debouch
under
the
fire
of
our
artillery
and
the
charges
of
our
cavalry
and
lost
again
several
hundred
in
dead
wounded
and
prisoners
i
can
not
give
the
reader
a
satisfactory
explanation
why
general
skrzynecki
did
not
pursue
the
enemy
on
the
perhaps
he
considered
the
great
fatigue
of
the
army
particularly
the
infantry
which
the
reader
will
of
course
presume
to
have
been
incurred
by
the
forced
march
which
the
distance
passed
over
supposes
another
reason
perhaps
was
that
he
had
sent
from
this
place
the
first
detachment
for
lithuania
wishing
to
be
sure
of
its
safe
passage
to
the
frontiers
the
detachment
in
fact
left
on
that
day
in
the
direction
of
mniszew
and
passed
the
frontier
of
the
kingdom
at
the
village
of
mien
between
ciechanowiec
and
suraz
opposite
brainsk
our
army
having
halted
one
day
at
xienzopol
on
the
evening
of
the
quitted
this
position
to
continue
the
pursuit
of
the
guard
and
overtook
them
in
the
forest
of
menzynin
this
forest
occupied
by
the
russian
was
so
near
the
heights
of
the
village
which
command
the
whole
vicinity
that
it
was
exposed
to
a
fire
of
artillery
from
these
heights
our
generalissimo
placed
his
artillery
on
the
heights
and
directed
a
fire
upon
the
forest
the
infantry
was
ordered
to
take
the
enemy
in
front
in
case
he
should
quit
the
forest
and
the
cavalry
was
to
advance
in
strong
columns
along
the
road
to
cut
off
his
escape
from
the
forest
into
the
road
in
this
they
were
successful
and
took
many
prisoners
thus
continually
pursued
and
subject
to
severe
losses
along
the
whole
route
the
guard
was
again
pressed
at
the
passage
of
the
narew
at
tykocin
the
consternation
and
disorder
of
the
enemy
was
such
that
he
did
not
take
time
to
destroy
the
bridge
our
lancers
commanded
by
the
brave
colonel
langerman
commenced
an
attack
upon
the
russian
cuirassiers
on
the
bridge
itself
the
regiment
of
cuirassiers
was
almost
annihilated
many
being
thrown
from
the
bridge
and
a
great
number
taken
prisoners
having
thus
driven
the
russian
guard
from
the
kingdom
of
which
the
narew
was
the
boundary
general
skrzynecki
commenced
a
retrograde
movement
to
meet
the
demonstration
which
general
diebitsch
might
make
upon
his
rear
on
the
night
of
the
our
army
began
this
movement
having
destroyed
the
several
bridges
of
the
narew
these
then
are
the
details
of
the
operations
upon
the
russian
guard
which
will
be
admitted
to
be
among
the
finest
in
the
history
of
modern
warfare
the
operations
of
napoleon
in
the
campaign
of
italy
the
brilliant
commencement
of
his
career
in
will
be
always
cited
as
the
highest
examples
of
but
i
do
not
think
that
a
finer
and
bolder
plan
of
operations
can
be
found
even
there
in
both
cases
success
was
owing
not
more
to
the
great
military
genius
of
the
leaders
than
to
those
high
moral
impulses
which
must
animate
armies
in
every
contest
for
national
existence
our
army
evacuating
on
the
the
position
at
kaluszyn
from
that
date
to
the
when
the
battle
of
ostrolenka
took
place
had
passed
over
a
distance
of
from
to
miles
which
deducting
the
six
days
occupied
in
action
was
executed
in
eight
days
making
an
average
of
english
miles
per
day
an
extraordinary
and
perhaps
unexampled
effort
the
rapidity
in
fact
with
which
this
movement
was
performed
was
such
that
our
forces
were
on
their
return
before
marshal
diebitsch
commenced
his
march
to
intercept
them
this
object
the
marshal
thought
himself
in
season
to
effect
but
the
reader
will
see
in
the
sequel
how
completely
he
failed
of
it
footnotes
footnote
the
reader
may
be
pleased
with
a
short
biographical
sketch
of
general
chrzanowski
who
distinguished
himself
here
so
much
this
skilful
officer
commenced
his
military
career
in
on
leaving
the
military
school
at
warsaw
as
officer
of
the
corps
of
engineers
in
which
department
he
was
distinguished
for
his
skill
and
industry
in
the
year
during
the
war
of
turkey
the
emperor
nicholas
was
desirous
of
obtaining
the
aid
of
polish
officers
of
engineers
and
chrzanowski
was
among
the
number
chosen
in
this
campaign
his
talents
made
themselves
remarked
and
marshal
diebitsch
gave
him
great
marks
of
confidence
and
placed
him
near
his
person
he
returned
from
the
campaign
as
captain
and
received
several
russian
decorations
in
the
revolution
like
a
worthy
son
of
poland
he
offered
his
services
to
the
common
cause
but
the
dictator
chlopicki
who
among
his
other
faults
had
that
of
either
being
unable
to
appreciate
or
willing
to
disregard
the
merits
of
the
officers
from
among
whom
he
was
to
make
his
appointments
did
not
give
any
important
trust
to
general
chrzanowski
perhaps
it
was
because
chrzanowski
was
among
the
number
of
those
who
were
desirous
of
taking
the
field
without
delay
with
the
glorious
commencement
of
the
era
of
the
command
of
our
estimable
skrzynecki
this
brave
officer
was
advanced
to
the
rank
of
lieutenant
colonel
and
was
placed
in
the
post
of
chef
major
while
in
this
post
he
was
advanced
to
the
rank
of
general
the
generalissimo
who
in
all
his
plans
observed
the
greatest
secrecy
and
his
example
ought
to
be
followed
by
every
good
general
initiated
however
chrzanowski
and
prondzynski
who
succeeded
the
former
as
chef
into
all
his
plans
and
indeed
those
two
brave
generals
were
valuable
counsellors
to
skrzynecki
among
other
qualities
necessary
to
a
great
general
chrzanowski
was
endowed
with
great
coolness
and
presence
of
mind
and
with
a
spirit
of
system
which
he
carried
into
every
thing
which
he
undertook
he
was
seen
in
the
midst
of
the
hottest
fire
with
his
plan
of
the
battle
before
him
referring
the
movements
to
the
plan
and
giving
his
orders
with
the
greatest
sangfroid
imaginable
the
generalissimo
could
not
enough
regret
that
he
had
not
given
him
the
command
of
the
expedition
to
lithuania
in
place
of
gielgud
if
the
skill
and
coolness
of
chrzanowski
could
have
been
united
in
that
expedition
with
the
bold
and
adventurous
enterprise
of
dwernicki

we
will
now
turn
to
take
a
view
of
the
state
of
affairs
in
that
province
the
brave
lithuanians
in
a
series
of
bloody
encounters
had
made
themselves
severely
felt
by
the
enemy
in
the
departments
of
roszyienie
and
szawla
at
about
the
middle
of
the
month
of
may
a
short
time
before
the
battle
of
ostrolenka
the
two
russian
corps
under
malinowski
and
szyrman
were
almost
annihilated
by
the
lithuanian
insurgents
who
night
and
day
falling
upon
them
from
forest
ambuscades
subjected
them
to
immense
losses
those
corps
literally
wandered
about
for
some
time
and
being
unable
to
hold
themselves
in
any
position
were
forced
at
last
to
evacuate
samogitia
in
the
department
of
bialystok
the
little
corps
recently
sent
under
the
command
of
general
chlapowski
began
its
operations
with
great
success
in
the
environs
of
bielsk
that
small
detachment
composed
of
four
squadrons

dispersed
and
what
was
of
much
importance
to
us
in
bielsk
as
well
as
in

several

were
found
in

constantine
was
taken
prisoner
the
corps
of
general
chlapowski
left
bielsk
in
the
direction
of
the
town
of
orla
and
entered
the
forest
of
bialowiek
where
he
received
reinforcements
of
lithuanian
insurgents
on
the
same
day
that
our
main
army
fought
at
ostrolenka
the
of
may
this
little
corps
had
an
engagement
with
the
enemy
in
the
environs
of
narewka
a
considerable
russian
detachment
under
the
command
of
general
rengardt
composed
of
infantry
cavalry
and
five
pieces
of
cannon
in
all
nearly
men
was
posted
near
nasielsk
this
considerable
force
was
attacked
by
our
small
corps
to
which
were
added
some
hundreds
of
insurgents
making
in
all
a
force
of
not
more
than
a
thousand
men
the
russians
were
completely
beaten
in
this
action
full
a
thousand
prisoners
were
taken
and
all
their
artillery
an
important
advantage
of
this
affair
was
the
taking
of
a
great
transport
of
some
hundred
vehicles
with
provisions
destined
for
the
russian
grand
army
by
the
dispersion
and
ruin
of
this
corps
the
department
of
bialystok
was
entirely
cleared
of
the
russians
and
nothing
interrupted
the
formation
and
organization
of
the
insurgent
forces
the
taking
of
bielsk
and
the
affair
of
narewka
will
be
admitted
by
the
reader
to
have
been
above
the
rank
of
ordinary
achievements
and
should
immortalize
the
handful
of
brave
men
which
formed
this
detachment
they
may
be
pointed
at
as
examples
with
many
others
in
this
war
of
how
much
can
be
effected
by
that
prompt
and
energetic
action
which
no
ordinary
motives
will
sustain
while
the
affairs
of
lithuania
and
samogitia
and
those
in
the
department
of
bialystok
wore
this
favorable
aspect
a
new
corps
was
approaching
to
aid
this
propitious
state
of
things
to
protect
the
insurrections
and
as
might
be
confidently
hoped
to
bring
them
to
a
sure
and
happy
result
the
new
force
destined
for
this
object
consisted
of
the
division
reinforced
by
a
squadron
of
cavalry
which
force
quitted
lomza
on
the
for
lithuania
before
returning
to
the
operations
of
the
grand
army
we
will
give
a
short
recapitulation
of
the
forces
which
had
been
sent
into
lithuania
and
samogitia
at
successive
periods
to
support
the
insurrections
in
those
provinces
the
first
corps
under
general
chlapowski
left
on
the
of
may
the
village
of
xienzopol
with
this
destination
to
enter
the
department
of
bialystok
to
occupy
the
forest
of
bialowiez
in
which
were
collected
the
forces
of
the
revolted
lithuanians
with
the
view
to
organize
these
forces
from
that
position
to
act
on
the
russian
communications
and
if
circumstances
might
allow
it
to
make
an
approach
upon
wilno
this
little
corps
as
we
have
seen
was
composed
of
infantry
volunteers
mounted
the
regiment
of
lancers
consisting
of
horsemen
and
two
pieces
of
light
artillery
the
second
corps
under
the
command
of
colonel
sierakowski
left
a
few
days
before
that
of
general
chlapowski
with
the
view
as
we
have
also
seen
to
follow
and
observe
the
division
of
general
saken
who
had
been
cut
off
by
general
skrzynecki
from
the
russian
guard
and
compelled
to
remain
on
the
right
bank
of
the
narew
this
corps
consisted
of
two
battalions
of
infantry
of
the
regiment
recently
formed
amounting
to
men
two
squadrons
of
horse
of
plock
also
recently
formed
in
all
and
two
pieces
of
cannon
this
corps
in
the
execution
of
its
instructions
obtained
several
advantages
over
general
saken
near
stavisk
colonel
sierakowski
then
advanced
to
the
environs
of
the
little
town
of
graiewo
where
he
took
a
strong
position
and
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
corps
of
general
gielgud
the
third
corps
under
the
command
of
general
gielgud
being
the
second
division
left
the
town
of
lomza
on
the
of
may
it
was
composed
of
battalions
of
infantry
consisting
of
men
squadrons
of
cavalry
of
men
sappers
and
pieces
of
cannon
the
total
force
of
these
three
corps
was
then
as
follows
pieces
men
besides
these
forces
which
were
detached
from
the
grand
army
there
were
formed
in
lithuania
several
regiments
of
infantry
and
cavalry
which
we
shall
designate
in
the
sequel
but
which
did
not
commence
active
service
until
the
battle
of
wilno
to
return
to
the
main
army
such
was
the
rapidity
with
which
the
operations
of
general
skrzynecki
upon
the
russian
guard
were
executed
that
as
we
have
said
he
was
on
his
retrograde
march
after
having
driven
that
guard
beyond
the
frontiers
before
marshal
diebitsch
received
intelligence
of
his
operations
it
was
then
that
the
russian
commander
having
no
hope
of
saving
the
guard
conceived
the
plan
of
attempting
by
a
prompt
diversion
towards
ostrolenka
to
cut
off
the
communication
of
our
army
with
warsaw
xxix
with
this
view
he
evacuated
his
position
at
sucha
and
mordy
passed
by
sokolow
crossed
the
river
bug
at
granne
entered
into
the
russian
province
of
bialystok
passed
through
a
corner
of
this
department
on
the
of
may
and
crossing
the
little
river
nurzec
r
at
ciechanowiec
entered
again
into
the
polish
territory
and
occupied
the
road
of
czyzew
and
zambrowo
without
any
delay
he
pushed
his
advanced
guard
as
far
as
czyzew
general
lubinski
was
then
at
nur
this
little
town
was
at
the
same
distance
from
ostrolenka
as
czyzew
but
the
communications
with
ostrolenka
were
more
difficult
czyzew
being
on
a
principal
road
the
enemy
observing
this
circumstance
and
taking
it
for
granted
that
lubinski
was
cut
off
from
the
main
army
sent
an
with
a
flag
of
truce
to
summon
him
to
surrender
this
summons
was
rejected
after
the
departure
of
the
general
lubinski
commenced
his
march
and
though
it
was
practicable
for
him
to
reach
ostrolenka
by
a
direct
route
yet
thinking
it
possible
that
czyzew
was
not
occupied
by
a
very
strong
force
and
that
he
might
profit
by
the
approach
of
night
he
determined
to
march
at
once
upon
the
latter
place
and
to
attack
the
russian
advanced
guard
there
this
bold
thought
was
executed
with
perfect
success
on
reaching
czyzew
he
found
two
regiments
of
cavalry
encamped
and
wholly
unprepared
for
an
attack
they
had
not
even
an
upon
the
road
to
nur
he
made
a
charge
which
threw
them
into
complete
disorder
and
compelled
them
to
retreat
with
the
loss
of
a
great
number
in
killed
and
wounded
and
four
to
five
hundred
prisoners
it
was
to
be
regretted
that
the
necessity
under
which
general
lubinski
was
placed
of
reaching
ostrolenka
as
soon
as
possible
did
not
permit
him
to
profit
farther
by
these
advantages
on
the
next
day
the
the
of
our
main
army
consisting
of
the
brigade
of
general
wengierski
was
attacked
at
by
the
russians
on
the
side
of
zambrowo
near
kleczkowo
a
village
situated
at
the
distance
of
three
leagues
from
ostrolenka
on
the
left
bank
of
the
narew
general
diebitsch
being
under
the
conviction
that
he
had
encountered
the
whole
polish
force
at
kleczkowo
consolidated
his
strength
there
and
determined
to
come
to
action
and
by
so
doing
give
time
for
another
corps
to
advance
in
the
direction
of
czyzew
and
occupy
ostrolenka
by
which
movement
he
trusted
that
our
army
would
be
cut
off
from
warsaw
and
forced
to
retire
to
lomza
the
russian
commander
presuming
on
the
celerity
of
his
movements
was
so
confident
of
meeting
our
whole
army
at
this
point
that
nothing
could
exceed
his
surprise
on
learning
that
our
army
had
already
passed
the
town
and
that
it
was
only
the
which
was
before
him
in
order
to
lose
no
time
he
commenced
an
immediate
attack
on
the
thus
posted
at
kleczkowo
our
general
in
chief
who
was
then
at
troszyn
on
hearing
the
fire
of
the
russians
at
kleczkowo
immediately
repaired
thither
and
profiting
by
the
fine
position
of
that
place
which
commanded
the
marshy
plain
on
the
side
of
the
enemy
passable
only
by
a
dyke
the
bridge
over
which
had
been
demolished
by
our
troops
ordered
general
wengierski
to
sustain
himself
in
that
position
until
night
in
vain
the
russian
cavalry
and
infantry
attempted
to
pass
this
dyke
at
each
approach
they
were
uniformly
driven
back
by
a
destructive
fire
of
grape
from
our
artillery
in
vain
were
sixteen
pieces
of
their
artillery
employed
to
silence
this
fire
our
position
was
too
commanding
to
be
affected
by
them
the
brigade
of
general
wengierski
having
held
out
in
this
position
with
the
greatest
determination
against
a
vastly
superior
force
for
nine
hours
left
the
place
at
night
in
the
greatest
order
and
followed
the
main
army
on
the
next
day
the
of
may
our
army
evacuated
ostrolenka
passed
the
river
narew
and
took
upon
the
right
bank
of
that
river
opposite
to
ostrolenka
a
new
position
leaving
the
bridge
partly
destroyed
but
in
such
a
state
that
the
russian
infantry
might
pass
it
slowly
not
long
after
we
had
occupied
our
position
the
enemy
commenced
debouching
over
this
bridge
battle
of
ostrolenka
xxx
the
battle
of
ostrolenka
which
cost
us
the
lives
of
two
brave
generals
kicki
and
henry
kaminski
was
in
point
of
tactics
simply
the
passage
of
the
river
we
may
presume
that
the
intention
of
general
diebitsch
was
by
passing
the
narew
at
this
point
to
send
at
the
same
time
a
corps
to
serock
in
order
to
cut
off
our
army
and
place
it
between
two
fires
at
the
russian
infantry
under
the
protection
of
a
most
terrible
fire
from
pieces
of
artillery
placed
in
a
very
strong
position
on
the
left
bank
of
the
narew
commenced
as
we
have
said
the
passage
of
the
river
general
skrzynecki
not
wishing
absolutely
to
prevent
this
passage
placed
but
sixteen
cannon
in
advantageous
positions
on
slight
elevations
of
ground
designed
to
prevent
the
repairing
of
the
bridge
and
the
consequent
rapid
passage
of
the
enemy
infantry
the
powerful
russian
artillery
attempted
without
success
to
silence
these
few
pieces
their
fire
was
equally
harmless
to
the
main
army
a
for
the
latter
was
withdrawn
to
an
advantageous
position
our
artillery
on
the
other
hand
was
used
with
great
effect
being
brought
to
bear
directly
upon
the
bridge
during
these
operations
the
advanced
guard
with
all
the
baggage
and
ammunition
of
the
army
received
the
order
to
take
up
the
march
towards
warsaw
at
our
artillery
received
orders
to
evacuate
their
position
and
the
skirmishers
were
ordered
to
advance
on
the
cessation
of
the
fire
of
the
artillery
the
light
troops
commenced
a
warm
fire
upon
the
columns
of
russian
infantry
which
had
already
passed
the
bridge
the
enemy
profiting
by
the
withdrawal
of
our
artillery
commenced
repairing
the
bridge
to
afford
a
passage
for
large
masses
of
infantry
and
artillery
a
strong
russian
column
after
passing
the
bridge
took
a
direction
to
the
left
to
throw
itself
into
the
forest
which
borders
on
the
narew
at
the
distance
of
a
quarter
of
a
league
from
the
bridge
and
by
occupying
that
forest
and
the
communications
which
traverse
it
they
thought
to
commence
an
attack
upon
our
right
wing
to
have
permitted
this
would
have
much
deranged
our
dispositions
the
polish
commander
observing
that
a
great
body
of
the
russian
infantry
had
already
passed
the
bridge
and
that
this
strong
column
had
been
sent
to
occupy
the
forest
ordered
general
lubinski
to
send
forward
a
brigade
of
cavalry
to
charge
upon
this
column
on
its
march
and
at
the
same
time
ordered
general
kaminski
with
a
division
of
infantry
to
make
a
charge
upon
the
russian
infantry
near
the
bridge
these
two
attacks
were
executed
with
great
promptness
and
spirit
and
were
successful
the
column
which
the
cavalry
attacked
on
its
march
to
the
forest
was
dispersed
with
the
loss
of
more
than
a
hundred
men
left
on
the
field
the
attack
of
the
division
of
general
kaminski
was
equally
fortunate
the
russian
columns
on
receiving
his
charge
fell
back
upon
the
bridge
or
concealed
themselves
under
the
banks
of
the
river
these
two
attacks
cost
us
the
lives
of
the
two
generals
kaminski
and
kicki
who
threw
themselves
upon
the
enemy
at
the
head
of
their
respective
columns
their
loss
was
deeply
regretted
by
the
army
and
the
nation
although
the
result
of
these
attacks
was
favorable
to
us
yet
the
general
in
chief
considering
the
terribly
destructive
fire
of
the
russian
artillery
which
commanded
the
whole
plain
near
the
bridge
decided
that
the
repetition
of
them
would
cost
us
too
severe
a
loss
and
commanded
both
the
cavalry
and
infantry
to
withdraw
to
their
former
position
and
to
cease
firing
at
the
firing
on
both
sides
had
entirely
ceased
profiting
by
this
interval
the
polish
army
pursued
its
route
and
the
russian
infantry
again
commenced
debouching
upon
the
bridge
at
dusk
nearly
the
whole
polish
army
was
on
the
march
to
warsaw
and
one
division
only
xxxi
remained
on
our
position
on
the
part
of
the
russian
army
we
may
suppose
that
nearly
two
divisions
had
passed
the
bridge
when
our
general
in
chief
wishing
to
profit
by
the
obscurity
of
the
night
in
order
to
subject
the
enemy
to
still
greater
losses
conceived
the
bold
idea
of
advancing
our
artillery
so
near
the
russian
columns
as
to
pour
upon
them
a
fire
of
general
skrzynecki
himself
approached
colonel
boehm
and
taking
the
command
of
the
twelve
pieces
of
light
artillery
under
him
led
them
in
person
to
the
distance
of
within
three
hundred
paces
of
the
enemy
and
brought
forward
at
the
same
time
two
regiments
of
cavalry
for
the
support
of
this
artillery
placing
this
little
detachment
in
a
very
advantageous
position
behind
small
elevations
of
ground
he
commanded
colonel
boehm
to
commence
firing
the
russian
columns
were
thrown
into
confusion
by
this
unexpected
and
terrible
fire
and
it
may
be
imagined
that
their
loss
was
immense
enclosed
as
they
were
within
a
narrow
space
on
the
bank
and
on
the
bridge
every
discharge
of
the
artillery
was
with
effect
and
by
the
testimony
of
the
prisoners
taken
their
loss
must
have
amounted
to
an
entire
brigade
without
estimating
those
who
left
the
field
wounded
and
those
who
fell
into
the
river
on
our
side
this
attack
cost
us
only
the
loss
of
two
officers
of
the
artillery
although
this
detachment
was
exposed
to
the
fire
of
the
whole
russian
artillery
our
battery
fired
but
three
rounds
when
the
general
gave
the
order
to
withdraw
and
follow
the
main
army
a
to
warsaw
these
are
the
details
of
the
battle
of
ostrolenka
in
which
the
loss
on
the
enemy
side
was
from
to
men
and
on
our
side
the
two
general
officers
above
mentioned
with
about
men
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
of

that
those

ought
to
satisfy
him
that
his

he
would
do
well
to
lay
down

replied
that
although
such
might
be
his
situation
he
could
not
think
of
surrendering
himself
without
a
struggle

to
satisfy
the
that
this
was
not
his
individual
feeling
alone

that
it
was
partaken
by
the
whole

his
soldiers
he
would
present
him
to
them

enable
him
to
satisfy
himself
personally

this
address
was
interrupted

indignation
from

they
commanded
him
to

the
question
might
be
asked
by

whether
this

was
necessary

did
not
pursue
his

to
warsaw
as
he
could
have
done
without

to

this

they
arrived

through
szczuczyn

graiewo
in

last
town
they
were
joined
by
the
little
corps

as
we
have
already
remarked
had
been
employed
in
observing

occupying
an
advantageous
position

xxxii
i
have
divided
this
battle
into
two
different
periods
marked
by
the
two
different
positions
which
the
enemy
successively
took
on
examining
the
plan
of
the
first
position
of
the
russians
it
will
be
at
once
seen
that
they
had
no
knowledge
of
the
arrival
of
our
corps
they
supposed
that
they
were
acting
against
the
corps
of
colonel
sierakowski
alone
and
they
had
conceived
the
design
of
him
on
the
morning
of
the
our
whole
corps
quitting
the
little
town
of
graiewo
met
at
the
distance
of
about
a
quarter
of
a
league
the
russian
flankers
against
whom
our
own
were
immediately
sent
out
the
russian
cavalry
began
to
retire
our
columns
continued
their
march
slowly
having
the
forces
of
colonel
sierakowski
in
front
as
an
advanced
guard
and
we
thus
arrived
at
the
lake
of
raygrod
the
advanced
guard
meeting
only
small
detachments
of
the
russian
cavalry
which
retired
as
we
approached
on
reaching
the
lake
our
advanced
guard
were
fired
upon
by
the
russian
skirmishers
concealed
in
the
woods
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
which
bordered
upon
the
causeway
colonel
sierakowski
received
orders
to
engage
with
them
he
sent
forward
his
own
light
troops
and
placed
two
cannons
upon
the
causeway
with
which
he
commenced
a
fire
upon
the
woods
the
russian
infantry
instantly
evacuated
the
woods
and
allowed
our
skirmishers
to
occupy
them
by
this
manoeuvre
the
russians
intended
to
lead
on
our
forces
with
the
view
to
attack
them
on
their
flank
and
even
to
surround
them
by
sending
detachments
to
the
right
and
left
as
will
be
seen
on
the
plan
in
a
short
time
our
larger
force
under
general
gielgud
commenced
debouching
between
the
two
lakes
a
strong
column
of
our
infantry
took
a
direction
towards
the
forest
to
the
left
and
another
column
to
that
on
the
right
to
dislodge
the
enemy
if
he
should
be
found
to
have
occupied
either
at
the
same
time
our
artillery
to
the
number
of
fourteen
pieces
taking
a
position
at
the
side
of
the
causeway
opposite
to
that
of
the
enemy
commenced
firing
the
whole
of
our
cavalry
and
the
greater
part
of
our
infantry
remained
in
the
centre
and
constituted
a
formidable
front
in
a
few
moments
after
these
dispositions
were
made
a
brisk
fire
of
tirailleurs
was
commenced
on
our
left
wing
a
the
russian
centre
b
suffering
from
the
fire
of
our
artillery
and
taken
by
surprise
at
the
unexpected
strength
of
our
forces
began
to
waver
this
was
a
signal
for
our
advance
colonel
pientka
who
commanded
the
artillery
gave
the
order
a
strong
column
of
three
battalions
of
infantry
commenced
the
hurrah
and
charged
with
the
bayonet
upon
the
wavering
columns
of
the
enemy
at
the
same
time
general
dembinski
gave
the
order
to
our
cavalry
to
charge
upon
that
of
the
enemy
on
the
right
and
left
the
first
squadron
of
the
lancers
of
poznan
received
the
order
to
throw
themselves
forward
and
fall
upon
the
breaking
columns
of
the
enemy
the
greatest
consternation
and
disorder
began
to
exist
in
the
russian
ranks
it
was
no
longer
a
retreat
it
was
a
flight
this
squadron
of
lancers
commanded
by
the
brave
major
mycielski
performed
prodigies
of
valor
they
entered
the
town
simultaneously
with
the
russian
columns
cutting
down
immense
numbers
of
the
enemy
and
taking
many
prisoners
this
squadron
courageously
remained
in
the
streets
of
the
city
exposed
to
the
fire
of
the
enemy
infantry
who
had
occupied
the
houses
until
the
arrival
of
our
own
infantry
in
this
exposed
situation
they
lost
their
commander
these
several
attacks
which
did
not
occupy
two
hours
caused
an
immense
loss
to
the
enemy
three
entire
battalions
which
formed
their
right
wing
c
consisting
of
men
were
taken
prisoners
with
three
superior
officers
and
fourteen
of
a
lower
grade
by
the
entry
of
our
forces
the
enemy
were
driven
from
the
town
and
took
another
position
d
upon
elevated
ground
on
the
opposite
side
of
a
small
stream
near
the
town
this
position
was
strong
and
commanded
the
town
and
the
whole
of
the
other
side
of
the
stream
general
saken
would
certainly
have
remained
long
in
this
position
if
our
right
wing
under
colonel
koss
had
not
as
we
shall
see
succeeded
in
passing
the
stream
at
a
higher
point
and
acted
on
his
flank
the
russian
general
as
soon
as
he
had
established
himself
in
his
new
position
commenced
a
fire
upon
the
town
which
was
returned
by
our
artillery
it
was
during
this
fire
that
colonel
koss
succeeded
in
passing
the
stream
at
a
quarter
of
a
league
above
the
city
on
the
right
this
was
effected
by
demolishing
the
buildings
in
the
vicinity
and
making
a
passage
for
the
artillery
from
their
materials
general
saken
seeing
his
left
wing
thus
menaced
evacuated
his
position
in
which
as
we
have
said
but
for
this
attack
on
his
flank
he
could
have
well
supported
himself
for
some
time
at
the
russians
commenced
their
retreat
upon
the
road
to
kowno
and
thus
terminated
a
battle
of
the
most
advantageous
character
for
us
and
with
which
begins
an
important
era
in
our
affairs
by
this
battle
the
polish
forces
had
made
the
acquisition
of
great
advantages
both
in
respect
to
strategy
and
tactics
and
the
highest
hopes
might
reasonably
be
cherished
in
regard
to
the
future
it
was
as
it
were
a
return
of
the
state
of
things
brought
about
by
the
victory
of
iganie
and
which
menaced
the
enemy
with
total
ruin
our
main
army
was
then
near
to
warsaw
composed
of
a
force
of
considerable
strength
and
which
under
the
command
of
skrzynecki
had
been
victorious
in
every
battle
new
troops
had
been
formed
there
neither
provisions
nor
forage
had
failed
for
they
were
constantly
sent
from
warsaw
to
the
army
in
whatever
quarter
it
might
be
the
russian
army
was
in
the
mean
while
suffering
under
all
the
disadvantages
which
we
have
before
described
wearied
and
discouraged
by
the
disasters
of
the
campaign
posted
in
regions
which
they
had
devastated
and
therefore
suffering
from
scarcity
without
hospitals
for
their
sick
and
their
wounded
for
the
towns
which
contained
them
had
been
destroyed
and
with
the
cholera
ravaging
their
ranks
that
army
was
in
the
most
precarious
situation
the
communications
between
the
russian
provinces
and
the
army
were
entirely
cut
off
by
the
polish
lithuanian
corps
they
received
their
provisions
exclusively
from
prussia
and
but
for
this
assistance
of
prussia
no
one
can
doubt
that
diebitsch
would
have
been
before
this
under
the
necessity
of
withdrawing
from
the
country
the
reader
will
also
remember
that
at
this
time
the
brave
and
skilful
general
chrzanowski
had
obtained
repeated
advantages
over
rudiger
in
the
environs
of
zamosc
and
that
the
little
corps
of
general
chlapowski
which
had
entered
on
the
of
may
the
russian
department
of
bialystok
was
acting
with
great
advantages
from
the
baltic
to
the
black
sea
the
provinces
of
podolia
volhynia
ukraine
as
well
as
lithuania
and
samogitia
containing
a
population
of
twelve
millions
of
inhabitants
were
in
a
state
of
excitement
and
would
soon
have
risen
in
the
holy
cause
they
were
waiting
only
the
arrival
of
our
victorious
troops
it
can
not
but
be
assumed
therefore
that
if
general
gielgud
at
the
head
of
the
polish
corps
in
lithuania
had
acted
with
promptness
and
energy
the
most
happy
results
would
have
been
achieved
it
is
therefore
with
the
deepest
chagrin
that
i
have
to
record
that
from
the
moment
of
the
termination
of
the
fortunate
battle
of
raygrod
all
the
operations
of
general
gielgud
were
not
only
deficient
in
energy
but
altogether
wrongly
planned
the
first
fault
which
he
committed
was
not
continuing
to
press
the
attack
upon
general
saken
after
he
had
retired
from
raygrod
under
the
pretext
that
the
soldiers
were
fatigued
the
corps
was
encamped
this
pretext
was
groundless
for
the
soldiers
themselves
demanded
to
be
led
in
pursuit
of
the
enemy
in
this
camp
we
passed
the
whole
night
and
left
it
xxxiii
at
the
hour
of
nine
the
following
morning
having
given
fifteen
hours
to
the
retreating
enemy
we
continued
our
march
to
kowno
through
the
duchy
of
augustow
on
the
of
may
we
arrived
at
suwalki
its
capital
and
remained
there
a
day
and
a
night
without
any
conceivable
reason
the
enemy
profiting
by
the
slowness
of
our
movements
escaped
the
certain
destruction
with
which
he
had
been
threatened
on
the
of
june
we
arrived
at
kalwaryia
and
at
that
town
our
corps
was
very
uselessly
divided
into
two
parts
the
larger
under
general
gielgud
took
the
road
to
gielgudyszki
on
the
niemen
to
pass
the
river
at
that
point
general
dembinski
with
the
remainder
of
the
corps
continued
on
the
main
road
and
on
the
of
june
arrived
at
alexota
this
separation
of
our
forces
into
two
bodies
to
pass
the
niemen
at
gielgudyszki
was
not
recommended
by
any
conceivable
advantage
and
indeed
operated
much
to
our
injury
this
plan
of
operations
was
also
in
opposition
to
the
instructions
not
only
of
the
general
in
chief
but
of
the
national
government
and
obstructed
the
rapid
execution
of
the
great
designs
of
the
campaign
in
any
plan
for
the
occupation
of
a
foreign
country
the
first
object
should
be
to
get
possession
of
the
principal
towns
for
at
those
points
are
chiefly
concentrated
both
the
moral
and
physical
resources
of
the
country
of
lithuania
the
town
of
wilno
is
the
capital
against
it
all
our
plans
should
have
been
directed
and
in
fact
the
instructions
of
the
government
to
general
gielgud
were
all
to
this
effect
by
a
prompt
occupation
of
that
city
we
should
have
unquestionably
reaped
the
greatest
advantages
as
wilno
was
the
residence
of
the
principal
officers
of
the
government
of
the
province
it
would
have
been
there
that
all
the
arrangements
could
best
be
made
for
a
provisional
administration
and
for
the
convocation
of
a
conventional
diet
of
the
people
in
regard
also
to
the
formation
of
new
forces
wilno
was
the
place
that
presented
the
greatest
facilities
taking
all
these
circumstances
into
view
it
must
be
conceded
that
after
the
battle
of
raygrod
the
first
object
of
general
gielgud
ought
to
have
been
to
march
upon
and
to
occupy
wilno
with
the
utmost
promptness
with
this
view
his
course
should
have
been
after
masking
his
movement
at
kowno
to
have
passed
the
niemen
n
at
rumszyski
a
village
which
was
about
sixteen
english
miles
above
kowno
and
in
the
direction
of
wilno
while
gielgudyszki
on
the
other
hand
was
miles
below
kowno
and
from
rumszyski
and
out
of
the
direction
of
wilno
with
the
exception
of
that
of
general
saken
no
other
russian
force
was
interposed
between
us
and
wilno
indeed
the
corps
of
general
chlapowski
with
which
he
had
traversed
the
department
of
bialystok
was
at
that
moment
between
kowno
and
wilno
and
had
we
passed
at
rumszyski
we
should
have
been
within
but
one
day
march
of
him
it
is
evident
then
that
wilno
would
have
fallen
into
our
hands
without
a
blow
all
these
advantages
were
sacrificed
by
making
the
passage
at
gielgudyszki
general
saken
meeting
with
no
interruption
thus
escaped
a
second
time
and
marched
from
kowno
to
wilno
at
the
same
time
several
other
russian
corps
began
to
concentrate
themselves
at
wilno
the
corps
of
general
dembinski
having
maintained
a
moderate
fire
upon
kowno
for
two
days
in
order
to
mask
our
movements
from
the
enemy
marched
for
gielgudyszki
to
follow
the
other
corps
in
the
passage
of
the
river
at
that
point
on
the
of
june
our
troops
thus
entered
the
province
of
lithuania
an
interesting
day
for
us
thus
engaged
in
the
effort
to
this
dissevered
portion
of
our
country
to
its
ancient
parent
the
manner
in
which
the
inhabitants
of
every
village
received
us
expressive
of
the
warmest
satisfaction
showed
that
they
regarded
us
as
brothers
this
reception
deeply
affected
both
soldiers
and
officers
they
hailed
us
as
their
deliverers
and
it
is
now
a
mournful
reflection
that
owing
to
the
misconduct
of
our
commanders
that
enthusiasm
instead
of
leading
to
happy
results
proved
in
the
end
only
an
aggravation
of
their
misfortunes
leaving
the
corps
of
general
gielgud
upon
the
niemen
we
will
return
again
to
the
operations
of
the
grand
army
and
of
the
different
detached
corps
our
main
body
which
after
the
battle
of
ostrolenka
retired
towards
warsaw
was
now
at
praga
where
the
of
the
commander
in
chief
were
fixed
general
skrzynecki
during
the
repose
of
the
army
occupied
himself
with
its
in
the
environs
of
zamosc
the
corps
of
general
chrzanowski
in
which
the
brave
general
romarino
commanded
a
brigade
was
sufficient
to
keep
the
different
russian
corps
in
check
on
the
of
june
the
russian
army
which
up
to
the
present
time
continued
in
the
environs
of
ostrolenka
on
the
left
bank
of
the
narew
commenced
its
operations
upon
the
right
bank
of
that
river
a
considerable
corps
amounting
to
men
passed
that
river
in
the
neighborhood
of
prasnysz
the
principal
object
of
this
corps
was
not
to
hostilities
but
to
protect
the
large
transports
of
provisions
which
were
sent
daily
from
prussia
in
the
environs
of
brzesc
was
the
corps
of
general
kreutz
the
russian
army
thus
fed
by
prussia
remained
inactive
in
their
position
at
ostrolenka
during
which
interval
and
while
he
was
perhaps
contriving
new
plans
for
our
subjugation
occurred
the
sudden
death
of
marshal
diebitsch
he
died
at
kleczkowo
not
far
from
ostrolenka
on
the
of
june
the
provisional
command
of
the
russian
army
was
taken
by
general
toll
if
the
reader
should
examine
closely
the
operations
of
the
two
armies
after
the
battle
of
ostrolenka
he
will
perhaps
be
astonished
at
their
inactivity
he
will
however
acknowledge
that
the
blame
of
that
inactivity
can
not
rest
upon
the
polish
side
the
retreat
which
we
made
was
necessary
first
for
the
sake
of
the
of
the
army
secondly
for
the
object
of
leading
the
enemy
to
the
environs
of
praga
which
were
in
a
state
of
devastation
and
generally
into
the
region
between
the
bug
and
the
liwiec
where
he
would
not
be
able
to
support
himself
and
in
this
manner
to
force
him
either
to
attack
the
fortifications
of
praga
to
attempt
a
passage
of
the
vistula
or
to
evacuate
the
country
that
either
of
the
two
first
would
be
attempted
while
the
insurrections
in
lithuania
and
samogitia
c
were
in
progress
and
after
our
success
at
raygrod
was
hardly
to
have
been
expected
for
the
one
would
cost
too
great
a
sacrifice
of
men
and
the
other
would
be
attended
with
too
much
hazard
if
then
the
russian
forces
undertook
nothing
it
was
a
consequence
of
their
critical
situation
we
can
in
fact
safely
assume
that
it
was
their
intention
to
evacuate
the
country
for
to
have
obtained
sufficient
supplies
by
their
own
means
was
almost
impracticable
when
therefore
this
army
remained
there
it
was
only
because
it
was
fed
by
prussia
who
did
not
scruple
openly
to
succor
the
enemy
in
his
perilous
position
by
sending
enormous
transports
by
the
roads
of
neydenburg
and
mlawa
it
was
those
transports
which
saved
the
russian
army
from
the
utmost
extremity
i
leave
to
the
reader
to
judge
then
whether
it
was
with
one
enemy
alone
that
the
poles
had
to
contend
the
prussian
government
which
arrested
all
the
volunteers
who
were
passing
through
its
territory
to
augment
our
ranks
and
which
stopped
all
the
aids
of
money
and
arms
sent
to
us
by
the
generous
friends
of
liberty
in
other
countries
took
every
occasion
to
aid
and
protect
our
enemy
if
that
government
has
satisfied
its
own
inhuman
will
by
this
interference
to
injure
a
cause
so
sacred
as
that
of
the
poles
they
have
unintentionally
aided
that
cause
by
raising
its
merit
in
the
eyes
of
the
present
and
future
ages
who
will
know
with
what
difficulties
we
had
to
struggle
in
return
for
these
good
offices
of
the
prussian
government
the

will
only
say
przyidzie

one
has
his
turn
if
the
two
main
armies
were
at
rest
it
was
not
so
with
the
corps
in
the
palatinate
of
lublin
where
general
chrzanowski
beat
on
the
of
june
general
rudiger
between
zamosc
and
uchania
and
took
from
him
numerous
prisoners
general
rudiger
was
forced
by
this
action
to
retire
to
lublin
and
to
cease
offensive
operations
general
chrzanowski
then
prepared
to
surprise
this
corps
with
the
aid
of
the
garrison
of
zamosc
it
was
on
the
of
june
that
after
being
apprized
of
the
continual
victories
of
general
chrzanowski
the
general
in
chief
concluded
to
hostilities
his
plan
was
to
act
in
concert
with
this
corps
and
to
crush
the
enemy
in
all
the
southern
parts
of
the
kingdom
he
would
afterwards
have
to
do
only
with
the
russian
main
army
which
had
commenced
passing
the
narew
and
entering
into
the
palatinate
of
plock
to
keep
its
communications
open
with
prussia
and
where
it
would
have
been
in
a
manner
cooped
up
between
the
narew
and
the
vistula
with
insurrectionized
lithuania
in
its
rear
and
our
army
in
its
front
or
flank
according
as
that
army
should
operate
at
stanislawow
at
wyskow
or
at
ostrolenka
it
was
here
again
that
our
commander
in
chief
felt
his
hopes
renewed
confiding
always
in
the
fortunate
result
of
the
operations
in
lithuania
which
had
so
happily
commenced
but
he
was
to
be
again
mournfully
disappointed
by
the
pusillanimity
of
the
generals
to
whom
the
expedition
to
lithuania
had
been
entrusted

allow
me
to
give
some
details

was
indeed
of
an
extraordinary
character

continue

push
their

threw
themselves

entered
the

was
full
of
the

infantry
far
from
being
discouraged
by
this
overwhelming
force
the
brave
poznanians
penetrated
the
different
streets

continued
their
attack
on
the
enemy
on
every
side
but
the
russian
infantry
protected
themselves
within
the
houses
and
behind
the
walls
and
commenced
a
fire
of
musquetry
which
fell
like
hail
upon
this
brave
handful
of
lancers
so
that
it
would
have
been
thought
that
not

the

was

at

early
age
to

in

that
an
inferior

it
discovered
the

last
degree
of
carelessness

sending

escaped

detachment
consisting
of
the
regiment
of
lancers
and
five
pieces

artillery
to
make
reconnoissances
in

direction

hundred
of
insurgent
cavalry
of

also
arrived
at

from

that
we
commenced

as
from
this
point
begins
an
era
in

it
may
be
well
to
give
a
new

infantry
consisted
of
battalions
of
infantry
amounting
in
all
to
nearly
men
including

of
sappers
our
cavalry
of
squadrons
amounting
to
about
and
our
artillery
of
pieces
of
cannon
to
these
forces
we
might
add
a
detachment
of
men
and
horse
acting
independently
as
a
corps
of
partizans
under
colonel
zaliwski
this
corps
of
colonel
zaliwski
was
formed
in
the
duchy
of
augustow
with
the
destination
to
operate
there
upon
all
the
demonstrations
of
the
enemy
on
his
communications
his
magazines
his
baggage
his
transportations
of
provisions
c
and
when
it
is
considered
that
this
officer
remained
for
four
months
thus
successfully
employed
and
exposed
to
the
enemy
forces
on
all
sides
a
particular
acknowledgment
is
due
to
him
for
his
meritorious
services
in
the
above
enumeration
we
have
of
course
excluded
the
force
of
general
szymanowski
which
as
we
have
stated
received
another
destination
with
the
forces
which
we
have
enumerated
general
gielgud
left
zeymy
on
the
of
june
the
operations
on
wilno
were
planned
for
an
attack
on
two
sides
and
with
that
view
general
dembinski
was
detached
with
a
small
corps
of
infantry
cavalry
and
pieces
of
cannon
this
general
was
to
attack
wilno
on
the
road
from
wilkomierz
to
that
city
at
the
same
time
that
the
larger
force
made
the
attack
on
the
road
from
kowno
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
wiliia
this
plan
demanded
the
most
exact
communication
between
the
two
attacking
corps
that
communication
was
not
observed
and
in
fact
as
it
will
be
seen
the
plan
itself
was
not
executed
the
corps
of
general
dembinski
reached
wieprz
on
the
river
swieta
on
the
of
june
on
the
next
day
it
passed
that
river
and
arrived
at
szerwinty
from
thence
after
resting
for
a
few
hours
the
corps
marched
to
myszogola
where
it
passed
the
night
on
the
leaving
this
village
after
a
march
of
two
leagues
the
corps
began
to
meet
with
small
detachments
of
the
enemy
circassian
cavalry
general
dembinski
gave
the
order
to
throw
forward
the
flankers
the
circassians
commenced
a
retreating
fire
and
thus
engaged
with
them
we
approached
within
a
league
of
wilno
taking
a
position
at
or
the
tavern
of
the
bishop
a
large
public
house
surrounded
by
small
dwellings
and
which
was
in
rather
a
commanding
situation
on
the
general
dembinski
sent
parties
of
cavalry
to
the
right
as
far
as
the
river
wiliia
w
and
to
the
left
as
far
as
kalwaria
to
make
reconnoissances
and
advanced
with
the
body
of
the
corps
in
the
centre
for
the
same
object
in
these
reconnoissances
a
constant
fire
of
flankers
was
kept
up
with
which
the
whole
day
was
occupied
it
was
a
great
fault
in
general
dembinski
to
have
commenced
this
fire
without
having
any
intelligence
of
the
situation
of
the
corps
of
general
gielgud
with
which
he
was
to
act
in
concert
on
the
morning
of
the
same
day
in
fact
on
which
general
dembinski
was
thus
employed
the
corps
of
general
gielgud
was
at
the
distance
of
english
miles
from
him
by
these
imprudent
reconnoissances
general
dembinski
laid
open
all
his
forces
to
the
knowledge
of
the
enemy
of
this
fault
the
enemy
took
advantage
on
the
next
day
on
the
at
sunrise
clouds
of
circassian
cavalry
made
their
appearance
and
commenced
attacks
upon
our
flanks
endeavoring
to
turn
them
several
columns
of
russian
infantry
then
approached
and
manoeuvred
upon
our
centre
on
which
also
pieces
of
russian
artillery
of
large
calibre
commenced
firing
other
columns
of
cavalry
manoeuvred
upon
our
wings
as
far
as
we
could
judge
the
enemy
forces
amounted
to
about
men
general
dembinski
seeing
the
strength
of
the
enemy
and
appreciating
his
own
danger
gave
orders
for
a
retreat
which
was
commenced
under
a
terrible
fire
from
the
enemy
artillery
and
from
his
flankers
who
harassed
us
on
every
side
the
retreat
was
executed
in
the
greatest
order
as
far
as
myszogola
a
distance
of
miles
from
our
position
with
the
loss
only
of
some
fifty
cavalry
on
arriving
at
myszogola
general
dembinski
concerned
at
receiving
no
intelligence
from
general
gielgud
sent
an
officer
with
a
report
of
what
had
occurred
that
officer
found
general
gielgud
with
his
corps
at
oyrany
occupied
in
making
the
passage
of
the
wiliia
at
that
place
the
report
of
general
dembinski
as
we
can
assert
from
personal
knowledge
gave
a
faithful
description
of
the
occurrences
of
the
preceding
days
and
contained
a
request
that
in
case
he
dembinski
was
expected
to
maintain
the
position
in
which
he
then
was
general
gielgud
must
send
him
reinforcements
of
infantry
and
artillery
the
report
finished
with
the
suggestion
that
it
would
be
under
all
circumstances
the
course
most
expedient
to
his
forces
with
those
of
general
gielgud
upon
the
receipt
of
this
report
to
which
general
gielgud
gave
little
attention
orders
were
sent
to
general
dembinski
to
depart
for
podbrzeze
eight
miles
to
the
left
of
the
road
which
leads
from
wilkomierz
to
wilno
the
pretext
of
this
order
was
to
attack
wilno
on
the
side
of
kalwaryi
and
to
pass
the
river
wiliia
at
that
point
thus
instead
of
being
allowed
to
unite
his
corps
with
that
of
general
gielgud
as
he
had
proposed
general
dembinski
was
ordered
to
remove
to
a
still
greater
distance
a
disposition
for
which
we
can
conceive
no
possible
motive
on
the
of
june
the
day
on
which
general
gielgud
commenced
his
attack
on
wilno
general
dembinski
was
thus
employed
on
his
march
without
an
object
to
podbrzeze
battle
of
wilno
xxxv
the
battle
of
wilno
was
in
point
of
tactics
simply
a
strong
attack
upon
the
russian
centre
a
with
the
view
by
forcing
it
to
pass
on
to
the
occupation
of
the
city
the
adoption
of
such
a
plan
supposes
an
ignorance
of
the
nature
of
the
position
of
the
enemy
and
of
the
strength
of
his
forces
indeed
any
plan
of
attacking
this
city
on
its
strongest
side
that
toward
kowno
was
almost
impossible
of
execution
illustration
illustration
the
battle
commenced
on
the
morning
of
the
of
june
the
enemy
was
dislodged
from
his
first
position
which
was
about
one
mile
from
the
city
their
retreat
was
caused
by
a
spirited
charge
by
the
regiment
of
lancers
upon
the
russian
artillery
and
the
columns
of
infantry

the
enemy
on
quitting
this

after
driving
the
russians
from
their
first
position
our
artillery
was
brought
forward
and
placed
opposite
the
enemy
centre
this
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
great
fault
at
the
same
time
that
our
artillery
was
thus
disposed
our
left
wing
received
orders
to
attack
the
right
wing
of
the
enemy
the
columns
of
our
infantry
composed
in
part
from
the
new
lithuanian
levies
threw
themselves
with
such
fury
upon
the
enemy
that
they
did
not
give
them
even
time
to
fire
but
fought
them
hand
to
hand
an
immense
slaughter
ensued
and
the
russians
began
to
give
way
before
this
desperate
assault
but
at
this
very
moment
our
artillery
who
could
not
sustain
themselves
under
the
overpowering
fire
of
the
enemy
from
his
commanding
position
began
to
fall
back
and
gave
time
to
the
russians
to
send
fresh
bodies
of
infantry
to
support
their
right
wing
our
left
wing

unable
to
sustain
a
conflict

the
reinforced
strength

the
enemy

apprehensive
of
being
cut
off
to
which
hazard
they
were
exposed
by

began
to
give
way
also

upon
that
a
retreat
commenced
along
our
whole

the
cavalry
the
cavalry
both
old
and
new
performed
prodigies
of
valor
in
executing
this
duty
single
squadrons
were
obliged
to
make
charges
against
whole
regiments
of
the
enemy
who
constantly
pressed
upon
us
with
the
object
of
throwing
our
forces
into
disorder
all
the
efforts
of
the
enemy
were
thwarted
by
this
determined
bravery
the
russians
themselves
have
borne
testimony
to
the
unparalleled
efforts
of
our
cavalry
on
that
occasion
our
lancers
seemed
to
feel
the
imminent
danger
of
permitting
the
russian
cavalry
to
fall
upon
our
ranks
and
they
fought
with
the
energy
of
desperation
they
repelled
the
attacks
of
a
cavalry
three
times
superior
in
force
and
which
was
in
part
composed
of
regiments
of
the
imperial
guard
the
enemy
having
been
thus
foiled
in
his
attacks
our
forces
repassed
in
safety
the
bridge
of
oyrany
leaving
it
destroyed
the
battle
of
wilno
so
disastrous
to
us
was
our
greatest
fault
in
the
expedition
to
lithuania
and
it
was
the
first
of
a
series
of
disasters
the
evil
consequences
of
this
battle
did
not
rest
with
ourselves
they
fell
heavily
upon
the
inhabitants
of
wilno
whose
hopes
of
acting
in
concert
with
us
were
disappointed
at
the
sound
of
our
cannon
a
revolt
of
the
inhabitants
was
commenced
and
after
the
repulse
of
our
forces
arrests
and
imprisonments
of
course
followed
this
unfortunate
battle
in
fine
disorganized
all
the
plans
of
the
main
army
and
had
a
most
discouraging
effect
upon
the
spirits
both
of
the
army
and
the
nation
an
attack
upon
wilno
at
a
time
when
all
the
enemy
forces
were
concentrated
there
should
only
have
been
made
upon
the
basis
of
the
most
extensive
and
carefully
adjusted
combinations
a
successful
attack
on
wilno
would
have
been
a
difficult
achievement
even
by
a
force
equal
to
that
of
the
enemy
when
the
strong
positions
of
the
place
are
considered
what
then
shall
we
say
of
an
attack
with
a
force
amounting
to
but
one
third
of
that
of
the
enemy
and
made
also
in
broad
day
upon
the
most
defensible
point
of
the
enemy
position
but
as
if
these
disadvantages
were
not
enough
general
dembinski
after
having
been
compromitted
at
myszggola
instead
of
being
enabled
to
aid
in
this
attack
was
by
the
orders
of
general
gielgud
at
the
very
moment
of
the
attack
marching
in
the
direction
of
podbrzeze
xxxiv
and
was
also
by
this
separation
exposed
even
to
be
cut
off
by
the
enemy
who
could
easily
have
done
it
by
sending
a
detachment
for
this
object
on
the
road
from
wilno
to
wilkomierz
this
succession
of
inconceivable
faults
arrested
the
attention
of
the
corps
and
created
a
universal
dissatisfaction
the
removal
of
general
gielgud
and
the
substitution
of
general
chlapowski
in
the
chief
command
who
had
distinguished
himself
so
much
in
the
departments
of
bialystok
and
grodno
was
loudly
called
for
general
chlapowski
was
unwilling
to
take
the
chief
command
but
to
satisfy
the
wishes
of
the
corps
he
consented
to
take
the
office
of
chef
major
a
post
in
which
he
was
virtually
chief
having
the
exclusive
responsibility
of
every
operation
to
this
arrangement
general
gielgud
readily
consented
it
took
effect
on
the
evening
of
the
from
that
day
general
chlapowski
was
the
director
of
all
our
operations
after
all
these
disasters
which
had
both
morally
and
physically
weakened
us
and
with
a
clear
knowledge
of
the
amount
of
the
strength
our
leaders
should
have
been
satisfied
that
it
must
be
out
of
the
question
with
us
to
act
any
longer
on
the
offensive
and
that
our
whole
plan
of
operations
on
samogitia
ought
to
be
abandoned
we
will
give
the
reader
an
exposition
of
the
views
of
a
great
majority
of
the
officers
of
the
corps
upon
this
point
formed
even
during
the
battle
of
wilno
it
was
near
on
the
and
when
our
line
was
commencing
their
retreat
that
colonel
valentin
with
several
other
officers
addressed
themselves
to
general
gielgud
represented
to
him
the
disastrous
situation
in
which
we
were
placed
and
proposed
to
him
a
plan
of
operations
adapted
to
our
new
circumstances
there
was
in
their
opinion
but
one
course
to
pursue
this
was
to
abandon
our
whole
plan
of
operations
between
the
rivers
niemen
dwina
and
wiliia
the
space
enclosed
between
these
rivers
the
baltic
sea
and
the
prussian
territory
was
a
dangerous
position
for
us
as
it
contracted
our
movements
and
at
the
same
time
exposed
us
to
being
surrounded
by
the
superior
forces
of
the
enemy
colonel
valentin
designated
as
the
most
eligible
line
of
operations
the
space
between
kowno
and
lida
from
this
oblique
line
we
could
at
any
moment
menace
wilno
he
proposed
to
occupy
kowno
and
to
fortify
that
town
as
well
as
alexota
and
lida
in
the
very
strongest
manner
on
this
line
we
should
have
been
in
a
situation
to
profit
by
any
advantageous
opportunities
which
the
negligence
of
the
enemy
might
leave
to
us
of
acting
upon
wilno
and
if
we
might
not
be
fortunate
enough
to
surprise
that
city
we
should
at
least
compel
the
russians
to
keep
a
strong
force
within
its
walls
as
a
garrison
the
town
of
lida
touches
upon
the
great
forest
of
bialowiez
it
is
situated
at
the
meeting
of
three
great
roads
viz
those
from
poland
from
volhynia
and
from
the
province
of
black
russia
a
circumstance
in
its
position
which
made
it
a
place
of
great
importance
the
communications
of
the
town
with
the
neighboring
forest
were
extremely
easy
and
this
forest
colonel
valentin
designed
a
place
of
concentration
for
all
the
insurgent
forces
of
lithuania
and
the
other
provinces
he
proposed
to
fortify
in
the
strongest
manner
all
the
roads
which
concentrated
here
and
thus
to
make
the
position
difficult
and
dangerous
of
access
to
the
enemy
this
forest
which
is
more
than
one
hundred
and
twenty
english
miles
in
length
and
from
thirty
to
sixty
in
breadth
reaches
the
great
road
which
passes
by
bielsk
from
warsaw
to
st
petersburgh
and
moscow
and
extends
northwards
to
the
environs
of
wilno
by
means
of
prompt
operations
according
as
circumstances
might
direct
our
forces
could
act
upon
each
of
these
roads
and
could
obstruct
all
the
communications
of
the
enemy
with
st
petersburgh
and
moscow
colonel
valentin
in
proposing
this
plan
also
gave
much
weight
to
the
consideration
that
our
main
army
under
general
skrzynecki
was
victorious
in
the
vicinity
of
warsaw
and
that
general
chrzanowski
was
with
a
corps
in
the
environs
of
zamosc
having
been
victorious
over
rudiger
and
on
the
point
of
entering
into
volhynia
with
this
latter
corps
a
junction
could
easily
be
effected
and
the
two
corps
could
act
in
concert
for
the
support
of
the
insurrections
which
might
occur
in
all
the
provinces
between
the
dnieper
and
the
black
sea
and
even
if
all
these
great
advantages
which
we
should
have
been
justified
in
counting
upon
had
not
been
attained
we
should
at
least
have
compelled
the
enemy
to
retain
a
great
body
of
forces
in
lithuania
and
thus
have
hindered
him
from
reinforcing
his
main
army

induced
by
these
events
from
these
melancholy
occurrences
in
lithuania
let
us
turn
to
follow
the
operations
of
the
grand
army
on
the
and
of
june
a
division
of
infantry
under
the
command
of
general
muhlberg
left
praga
and
took
the
direction
of
the
environs
of
stanislawow
and
jadow
in
the
latter
place
this
division
surprised
a
strong
detachment
of
the
enemy
in
camp
and
took
many
prisoners
thence
they
were
instructed
to
follow
the
left
bank
of
the
liwiec
as
far
as
the
environs
of
kaluszyn
and
even
to
zelechow
clearing
each
bank
of
the
presence
of
the
enemy
this
division
was
then
to
join
itself
with
the
division
of
cavalry
of
general
jankowski
which
on
that
day
left
for
kock
those
two
divisions
combined
were
to
endeavor
to
act
upon
the
different
corps
of
the
enemy
which
were
pressed
by
the
corps
of
general
chrzanowski
the
latter
general
had
commenced
the
offensive
on
the
and
had
driven
the
corps
of
general
rudiger
from
its
position
at
and
compelled
it
to
retreat
to
lublin
continually
pursued
by
him
on
the
he
took
that
town
by
storm
the
enemy
was
obliged
to
evacuate
it
in
disorder
leaving
a
great
number
killed
wounded
and
prisoners
and
to
take
the
direction
of
kock
the
corps
of
rudiger
would
have
been
inevitably
destroyed
if
another
russian
corps
of
strong
had
not
marched
to
its
aid
general
chrzanowski
apprized
of
the
arrival
of
this
reinforcement
quitted
the
pursuit
for
a
more
favorable
moment
and
to
avoid
an
engagement
with
this
combined
force
of
the
enemy
as
well
as
to
escort
the
prisoners
which
he
had
taken
at
lublin
to
a
place
of
safety
he
repassed
the
vistula
at
pulawy
he
had
scarce
reached
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
when
he
received
the
intelligence
that
the
division
of
general
jankowski
reinforced
by
a
brigade
of
infantry
was
approaching
kock
where
was
already
the
corps
of
general
rudiger
and
whither
the
corps
of
general
keisarow
above
mentioned
was
hastening
to
join
him
in
order
therefore
to
take
between
the
two
fires
all
the
forces
which
might
be
collected
at
kock
general
chrzanowski
promptly
repassed
the
river
reached
the
environs
of
kock
and
waited
impatiently
for
the
attack
of
general
jankowski
in
the
opposite
direction
but
jankowski
delayed
his
movement
and
allowed
the
corps
of
kiesarow
to
join
rudiger
the
following
are
the
details
of
this
expedition
as
they
were
related
by
an
officer
of
the
division
of
muhlberg
and
which
exhibit
satisfactory
evidence
of
treason
on
the
part
of
general
jankowski
issue
of
this
expedition
which
could
have
had
the
most
brilliant
results
has
filled
us
with
grief
and
indignation
we
were
marching
in
the
utmost
haste
upon
kock
with
the
hope
of
beating
rudiger
on
our
route
at
stoczek
for
our
misfortune
we
were
joined
by
the
division
of
cavalry
under
general
jankowski
who
then
took
the
command
we
ought
to
have
passed
the
wieprz
to
meet
rudiger
and
cut
him
off
suddenly
news
was
brought
to
us
that
the
enemy
had
passed
the
wieprz
at
lysobyki
with
infantry
sixteen
squadrons
of
cavalry
and
ten
pieces
of
cannon
general
jankowski
then
called
a
council
of
war
at
which
the
following
plans
were
adopted
general
turno
was
to
attack
the
enemy
in
the
direction
of
sorokomla
and
general
jankowski
was
to
come
to
his
support
at
the
first
sound
of
his
cannon
the
brigade
of
general
romarino
detached
from
the
corps
of
general
chrzanowski
and
destined
to
act
as
an
independent
corps
was
to
act
upon
the
left
wing
and
general
bukowski
with
a
brigade
of
cavalry
upon
the
right
wing
of
the
enemy
by
bialobrzegi
this
plan
which
in
the
conviction
of
all
our
officers
would
have
exterminated
the
corps
of
general
rudiger
and
the
execution
of
which
was
reserved
to
general
jankowski
came
to
nothing
turno
trusting
in
the
faithful
execution
of
the
plan
attacked
the
enemy
with
courage
and
vigor
he
was
sure
of
receiving
support
on
three
sides
he
made
head
against
the
enemy
for
six
hours
while
generals
jankowski
and
bukowski
at
the
distance
of
about
three
miles
from
him
hearing
and
even
seeing
the
fire
of
the
action
remained
in
a
state
of
complete
inaction
nay
more
a
russian
detachment
took
possession
almost
before
their
eyes
of
the
ammunition
and
baggage
of
a
whole
regiment
and
they
did
not
stir
to
prevent
it
general
turno
fought
with
bravery
and
sangfroid
notwithstanding
that
none
came
to
his
support
and
did
not
retire
till
he
received
orders
to
do
so
the
whole
corps
was
indignant
at
the
conduct
of
jankowski
and
his
bukowski
who
had
evidently
acted
the
part
of
traitors
general
skrzynecki
was
deeply
afflicted
with
the
sad
result
of
an
expedition
which
based
upon
infallible
calculations
had
promised
the
very
surest
success
the
event
was
of
the
most
disastrous
consequence
to
us
if
the
corps
of
general
rudiger
had
been
crushed
as
it
certainly
could
have
been
the
combined
corps
of
chrzanowski
muhlberg
and
jankowski
could
have
acted
upon
all
the
corps
of
the
enemy
which
might
be
found
between
the
wieprz
the
swider
and
the
liwiec
as
those
corps
were
quite
distant
from
their
main
army
which
was
now
upon
the
right
of
the
narew
and
as
they
were
even
without
a
free
communication
with
each
other
they
could
have
each
been
beaten
in
detail
by
a
prompt
action
on
our
part
i
leave
to
the
reader
to
decide
whether
after
we
should
have
obtained
such
successes
over
these
detached
corps
we
could
not
have
acted
with
certain
success
against
the
russian
main
army
the
corps
of
general
rudiger
which
thus
escaped
its
fate
left
for
the
environs
of
lukow
whither
it
was
followed
by
general
chrzanowski
the
corps
of
general
jankowski
returned
in
the
direction
of
macieiowiec
and
laskarzew
and
the
division
of
general
muhlberg
returned
to
minsk
the
general
in
chief
deprived
generals
jankowski
and
bukowski
of
their
command
and
ordered
them
to
be
tried
by
a
but
other
and
even
more
affecting
disasters
were
awaiting
us
poland
which
had
been
so
often
made
a
sacrifice
of
through
her
own
generosity
and
confidence
now
nourished
upon
her
bosom
the
monsters
who
were
plotting
her
destruction
on
the
of
june
general
skrzynecki
received
information
of
a
conspiracy
which
had
for
its
object
the
delivering
up
of
warsaw
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
by
liberating
and
arming
the
russian
prisoners
several
generals
of
whom
distrust
had
been
felt
and
who
had
been
deprived
of
their
commands
when
the
revolution
broke
out
having
been
known
as
the
vile
instruments
of
the
former
government
were
at
the
bottom
of
this
plot
of
this
painful
intelligence
general
skrzynecki
immediately
apprized
the
national
government
who
relying
on
his
report
caused
to
be
arrested
general
hurtig
former
commander
of
the
fortress
of
zamosc
and
a
base
instrument
of

the
russian
chamberlain
fenshawe
a
mr
lessel
and
a
russian
lady
named
bazanow
generals
jankowski
and
bukowski
were
also
implicated
in
the
conspiracy
this
band
of
traitors
intended
to
get
possession
of
the
arsenal
to
arm
the
russian
prisoners
and
to
destroy
the
bridges
in
order
to
cut
off
all
communication
with
the
army
which
was
then
on
the
right
bank
of
the
vistula
and
the
russian
army
advertised
of
this
movement
was
then
to
pass
to
the
left
bank
of
the
vistula
at
plock
or
dobzyn
and
take
possession
of
warsaw
those
traitors
succeeded
in
setting
at
large
a
great
number
of
russian
prisoners
at
czenstochowa
what
a
terror
must
poor
poland
have
been
to
the
russian
cabinet
which
did
not
find
it
enough
to
have
deluged
her
with
their
immense
forces
and
to
have
engaged
all
the
neighboring
cabinets
to
aid
them
against
her
but
must
go
farther
and
by
the
employment
of
such
vile
means
attempt
to
kindle
hostilities
in
her
interior
and
to
subject
her
at
the
same
time
to
a
civil
and
an
external
war
they
had
good
cause
for
these
desperate
attempts
from
the
earliest
stage
of
the
conflict
they
had
seen
that
the
poles
nerved
by
the
consciousness
of
the
justice
of
their
cause
were
capable
of
crushing
the
force
which
they
had
sent
to
execute
the
will
of
the
despot
unable
to
meet
us
in
the
open
field
they
must
invent
some
new
method
no
matter
how
base
to
accomplish
their
end
it
was
through
the
instrumentality
of
their
intrigues
that
the
dictatorship
was
prolonged
it
was
by
such
intrigues
that
the
apple
of
discord
was
thrown
into
our
national
congress
and
even
into
the
ranks
of
that
handful
of
brave
men
who
had
sworn
to
sacrifice
themselves
in
the
cause
of
their
country
they
employed
their
vile
accomplices
to
betray
us
and
they
succeeded
the
discovery
of
this
extensive
treason
struck
the
people
with
consternation
and
dismay
it
drove
them
to
a
state
bordering
on
desperation
when
poland
had
sent
and
was
sending
her
sons
and
even
her
daughters
to
the
field
of
death
when
she
was
sacrificing
every
thing
to
achieve
her
deliverance
and
was
awaiting
the
fruits
of
such
sacrifices
sure
if
not
to
conquer
at
least
to
fall
with
honor
she
sees
that
all
is
in
vain
that
her
holy
purposes
are
mocked
at
and
that
all
her
noble
efforts
are
thwarted
can
we
be
surprised
then
at
the
state
of
the
popular
mind
which
ensued
the
state
of
feeling
which
these
events
caused
was
aggravated
by
the
reflection
that
the
surveillance
of
certain
individuals
of
whom
distrust
had
been
already
entertained
had
been
more
than
once
demanded
and
that
from
an
early
period
it
was
urged
upon
the
government
that
the
russian
prisoners
particularly
those
of
distinction
should
be
carefully
watched
and
prevented
from
holding
free
communication
together
or
with
others
so
far
however
from
such
care
having
been
taken
the
very
jews
were
permitted
to
communicate
with
them
constantly
and
to
bring
them
intelligence
of
the
events
of
the
war
can
it
be
wondered
then
that
the
neglect
of
these
repeated
warnings
and
the
tremendous
consequences
which
had
well
nigh
followed
this
neglect
should
have
weighed
upon
the
minds
of
the
people
and
have
even
brought
the
national
government
itself
into
suspicion
it
was
in
fact
from
this
moment
that
the
nation
began
first
to
look
with
dissatisfaction
and
distrust
upon
that
government
upon
prince
czartoriski
its
head
and
even
upon
the
general
in
chief
himself
the
melancholy
news
of
the
treason
of
jankowski
filled
the
minds
of
the
patriots
with
bitter
anticipations
they
naturally
foreboded
that
if
such
treasons
could
be
perpetrated
in
the
grand
army
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
general
in
chief
the
danger
might
be
still
greater
in
the
more
distant
corps
their
forebodings
were
but
too
well
justified
by
the
events
which
took
place
in
lithuania

intelligence
of
which
was
soon

passage
of

much
importance
to
three

and
a
squadron
of
cavalry
all
of
them
newly

that
too
without

three

by

in

even
by

why
then

owing
in

fortune
that
all
these

not

were
all
proper

it

broken
up
wilno
would
have
been
ours
and
all
such
arrangements
could
have
been
made
there
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
in
that
event
the
brave
lithuanians
would
have
come
in
from
all
sides
and
crowded
our
ranks
without
waiting
for
any
appeal
to
be
made
to
them
but
at
present
a
new
crisis
had
arrived
we
had
fought
the
battle
of
wilno
with
a
disastrous
result
the
enemy
had
become
acquainted
with
the
inferiority
of
our
forces
and
had
begun
to
understand
the
errors
of
our
commander
and
was
prepared
to
take
advantage
of
them
in
fine
the
lithuanians
themselves
witnessing
all
this
gross
mismanagement
became
disgusted
and
after
having
once
so
cheerfully
tendered
their
began
at
length
to
discover
that
they
were
sacrificing
themselves
in
vain
and
that
the
fate
of
the
inhabitants
of
wilno
would
await
them
this
people
as
we
have
already
stated
had
commenced
their
insurrection
two
months
before
they
had
hopes
of
any
assistance
from
our
forces
and
badly
armed
as
they
were
they
had
maintained
a
partizan
warfare
during
this
period
with
uniform
success
we
can
therefore
have
no
reason
to
reproach
them
if
after
the
misconduct
which
was
exhibited
before
their
eyes
they
began
to
be
reluctant
to
join
their
forces
to
our
own
and
chose
to
reserve
the
sacrifice
of
their
exertions
and
their
lives
for
some
other
occasion
when
there
might
be
some
hope
of
useful
results
the
six
or
seven
days
which
we
passed
thus
at
keydany
and
wilkomierz
seemed
as
if
designed
to
invite
the
enemy
to
pursue
his
advantages
and
to
lead
him
to
the
idea
of
surrounding
our
forces
the
enemy
fortunately
for
us
did
not
improve
the
opportunity
which
we
presented
him
but
remained
inactive
this
inactivity
whether
it
arose
from
the
imbecility
of
his
commanders
or
whatever
other
cause
afforded
us
an
opportunity
of
changing
our
plans
and
of
extricating
ourselves
from
the
dangerous
position
in
which
we
were
placed
but
instead
of
this
we
awaited
his
attack
on
the
the
enemy
commenced
an
attack
upon
every
point
at
wilkomierz
wieprz
janow
and
kowno
with
his
whole
force
a
corps
of
russians
with
cannon
commenced
the
attack
on
kowno
defended
as
we
have
said
by
new
troops
from
morning
until
night
the
defence
was
sustained
with
great
courage
the
contest
was
for
the
first
half
of
the
day
in
the
town
itself
and
the
rest
of
the
day
was
spent
in
disputing
the
passage
of
the
bridge
over
the
wiliia
the
russians
occupying
all
the
houses
upon
the
banks
of
the
river
and
the
neighboring
heights
commenced
a
terrible
fire
of
artillery
and
musquetry
upon
the
bridge
which
was
defended
by
a
body
of
infantry
almost
without
ammunition
at
nightfall
colonel
kikiernicki
seeing
that
the
russian
cavalry
had
found
means
of
fording
the
river
ordered
a
retreat
but
remained
himself
at
the
head
of
a
single
company
defending
the
bridge
until
he
learnt
that
the
rest
of
the
corps
had
passed
the
town
of
sloboda
and
had
gained
the
heights
which
are
behind
the
town
upon
that
bridge
fell
the
captain
of
this
company
zabiello
a
lithuanian
he
was
shot
in
the
act
of
cutting
away
the
bridge
with
his
own
hands
this
company
after
having
thus
sustained
their
post
at
the
bridge
with
the
greatest
bravery
commenced
their
retreat
the
russian
cavalry
having
succeeded
in
fording
the
river
had
already
commenced
acting
in
their
rear
at
the
same
time
the
russian
columns
of
infantry
were
debouching
upon
the
bridge
colonel
kikiernicki
perceiving
his
situation
animated
his
little
corps
to
make
the
desperate
effort
of
breaking
through
the
russian
cavalry
and
of
gaining
sloboda
his
spirit
was
seconded
by
his
brave
followers
and
this
company
of
one
hundred
men
raising
the
hurrah
forced
a
passage
through
the
enemy
cavalry
gained
sloboda
and
under
cover
of
night
succeeded
in
joining
their
comrades
in
this
effort
colonel
kikiernicki
fell
wounded
and
was
made
prisoner
by
the
enemy
the
detachment
having
lost
one
half
of
their
numbers
in
the
sanguinary
attack
to
which
the
mismanagement
of
our
general
had
exposed
them
took
the
road
to
janow
in
this
manner
ended
the
attack
on
kowno
and
the
russians
took
possession
of
that
important
post
which
might
be
regarded
as
the
key
to
all
our
communications
with
poland
there
can
be
no
excuse
for
not
having
fortified
kowno
it
is
a
town
containing
ten
or
twelve
thousand
inhabitants
of
which
one
half
perhaps
were
jews
but
they
could
have
been
employed
in
the
construction
of
the
works
it
was
also
most
favorably
situated
for
defence
being
surrounded
by
heights
on
every
side
on
the
same
day
sanguinary
skirmishes
took
place
at
janow
wieprz
and
wilkomierz
the
two
first
towns
were
abandoned
in
the
attack
on
wilkomierz
which
was
successfully
repelled
an
action
took
place
in
which
the
lancers
of
poznan
and
plock
threw
themselves
upon
the
flank
of
russian
cavalry
and
after
causing
severe
loss
took
about
eighty
prisoners
consisting
of
circassians
general
dembinski
on
the
night
of
the
learning
that
our
positions
of
janow
and
wieprz
were
abandoned
quitted
wilkomierz
on
the
next
day
and
took
the
road
to
szawla
xxxiv
although
the
occupation
by
the
enemy
of
the
town
of
kowno
and
the
interruption
of
our
whole
line
of
operations
on
the
swienta
and
wiliia
made
our
situation
very
perilous
yet
it
was
still
possible
to
avoid
the
disasters
which
followed
and
to
effect
a
return
to
poland
by
concentrating
all
our
forces
at
keydany
we
could
have
effected
a
passage
of
the
niemen
in
the
same
manner
as
we
had
already
done
in
the
direction
of
gielgudyszki
which
would
have
left
the
enemy
in
our
rear
while
on
the
other
side
of
the
niemen
the
enemy
were
not
in
force
enough
to
prevent
our
passage
but
instead
of
doing
this
as
if
to
insure
our
ruin
a
small
detachment
consisting
of
four
squadrons
of
cavalry
and
the
sappers
under
the
command
of
colonel
koss
were
sent
to
make
a
bridge
over
the
niemen
this
measure
is
perfectly
inexplicable
scarcely
had
this
detachment
arrived
at
the
river
and
commenced
the
erection
of
the
bridge
when
they
were
attacked
on
two
sides
by
the
cuirassiers
and
the
artillery
of
the
enemy
they
were
saved
only
by
the
judicious
conduct
of
colonel
koss
who
threw
himself
into
the
protection
of
the
neighboring
forest
and
succeeded
in
rejoining
the
corps
the
loss
which
we
incurred
by
this
expedition
of
all
our
implements
for
the
construction
of
bridges
was
irreparable
from
this
time
the
enemy
did
not
for
a
moment
lose
sight
of
us
and
throwing
his
superior
forces
upon
the
great
road
which
leads
from
keydany
through
rosseyny
to
szawla
forced
us
to
take
that
direction
which
was
the
most
dangerous
for
us
as
the
field
of
operation
for
our
forces
was
continually
becoming
more
and
more
contracted
combat
of
rosseyny
the
cause
of
this
action
which
it
would
have
been
most
desirable
to
have
avoided
was
a
strong
attack
by
the
enemy
upon
the
of
general
chlapowski
which
was
marching
on
the
road
to
szawla
to
avoid
exposing
the
to
a
great
loss
or
even
to
the
chance
of
it
the
command
was
given
to
take
position
and
the
corps
was
placed
in
order
of
battle
the
battle
of
rosseyny
which
lasted
scarcely
four
hours
was
very
sanguinary
and
highly
honorable
to
the
polish
arms
the
object
of
the
enemy
on
this
occasion
was
to
surround
our
left
wing
as
soon
as
he
perceived
that
our
corps
had
taken
position
and
was
arranged
in
order
of
battle
the
enemy
brought
forward
his
artillery
consisting
of
pieces
of
cannon
and
commenced
a
heavy
fire
upon
our
centre
this
fire
did
not
cause
a
great
loss
for
our
position
being
elevated
the
shot
struck
too
low
to
be
effective
a
few
moments
after
this
fire
of
artillery
was
commenced
a
strong
column
of
russian
cavalry
showed
itself
on
our
right
wing
this
column
had
with
it
a
body
of
light
artillery
which
commenced
fire
also
on
our
left
wing
which
was
supported
upon
a
marsh
and
for
that
reason
in
little
expectation
of
an
attack
but
a
small
force
was
collected
this
wing
was
composed
of
a
battalion
of
infantry
and
the
regiment
of
lancers
these
troops
had
been
placed
on
this
wing
to
repose
from
the
combats
and
fatigues
of
the
day
and
night
preceding
in
which
they
had
acted
as
the
brave
lancers
however
at
the
first
sight
of
the
enemy
demanded
of
the
general
to
be
permitted
to
make
a
charge
this
permission
being
given
at
the
first
discharge
of
the
russian
artillery
our
soldiers
threw
themselves
with
impetuosity
upon
both
the
cavalry
and
the
artillery
of
the
enemy
the
capture
of
sixty
prisoners
and
the
spiking
of
three
cannon
were
the
fruits
of
this
brilliant
attack
it
was
the
last
charge
of
that
brave
regiment
our
centre
was
not
less
fortunate
than
our
left
wing
our
artillery
being
better
placed
than
that
of
the
enemy
several
of
his
pieces
were
dismounted
and
his
fire
began
to
slacken
for
some
hours
a
light
fire
of
tirailleurs
was
continued
on
both
sides
when
our
generals
seeing
that
the
enemy
did
not
renew
the
attack
gave
orders
to
evacuate
the
position
and
to
resume
the
march
for
szawla
on
the
same
night
the
corps
arrived
at
cytowiany
there
our
forces
were
joined
by
the
corps
of
general
rohland
which
had
had
a
bloody
skirmish
at
beysagola
xxxiv
on
the
same
day
on
which
general
dembinski
was
also
attacked
at
poniewieze
the
corps
of
general
chlapowski
left
the
next
day
for
the
attack
of
szawla
which
was
occupied
by
a
russian
garrison
the
corps
of
general
dembinski
which
as
we
have
already
stated
was
marching
by
another
route
upon
szawla
arrived
there
at
on
the
that
general
considering
the
smallness
of
the
russian
garrison
in
this
town
consisting
only
of
four
battalions
of
infantry
and
six
pieces
of
cannon
after
waiting
a
short
time
for
the
arrival
of
the
corps
of
general
chlapowski
concluded
to
send
a
summons
by
colonel
miroszewski
to
the
russian
commandant
proposing
to
him
to
surrender
and
save
a
useless
effusion
of
blood
the
russian
colonel
kurow
would
not
accept
of
these
friendly
propositions
and
compelled
general
dembinski
to
order
an
attack
a
very
moderate
one
however
as
he
was
in
hopes
that
the
arrival
of
our
superior
forces
would
soon
convince
the
russian
commander
that
a
defence
would
be
useless
in
fact
the
corps
of
general
chlapowski
arrived
at
about
at
a
village
about
four
miles
from
szawla
where
he
was
met
by
an
officer
sent
by
general
dembinski
with
a
report
of
the
circumstances
which
had
taken
place
indeed
the
sound
of
the
cannon
and
musquetry
ought
already
to
have
satisfied
general
chlapowski
that
general
dembinski
was
engaged
in
the
attack
but
instead
of
hastening
to
his
assistance
he
went
into
camp
and
thus
remained
until
two
hours
past
midnight
at
two
then
of
the
morning
of
the
the
corps
took
up
the
march
and
arrived
by
before
szawla
attack
on
szawla
on
examining
the
plan
of
this
battle
and
considering
the
smallness
of
the
russian
garrison
in
szawla
we
can
not
but
be
satisfied
that
the
town
ought
to
have
been
taken
at
the
first
assault
and
it
will
seem
almost
incredible
that
after
having
occupied
four
hours
in
an
unsuccessful
attack
we
should
have
at
last
quitted
our
position
on
arriving
on
the
plain
before
szawla
the
two
corps
were
placed
in
order
of
battle
the
force
of
general
dembinski
changed
its
position
and
formed
our
left
wing
we
commenced
a
fire
of
artillery
from
the
right
wing
and
the
centre
at
the
same
time
throwing
forward
our
skirmishers
the
enemy
had
made
an
entrenchment
round
the
whole
town
behind
which
his
infantry
was
concealed
and
upon
the
right
of
the
town
he
had
constructed
a
redoubt
on
the
sides
of
the
town
against
which
the
right
wing
and
centre
were
posted
a
general
fire
of
musquetry
and
artillery
was
commenced
under
the
cover
of
which
our
light
troops
endeavored
to
take
possession
of
the
ramparts
general
szymanowski
and
colonel
pientka
who
were
the
only
general
officers
who
were
actively
engaged
in
this
battle
seeing
that
this
attack
of
the
light
troops
upon
the
russian
infantry
thus
safely
entrenched
was
very
destructive
to
us
and
would
prolong
the
attack
ordered
two
battalions
of
infantry
under
colonel
jeroma
and
piwecki
to
make
an
assault
protected
by
two
pieces
of
cannon
and
a
squadron
of
the
regiment
of
lancers
this
order
was
executed
with
the
greatest
determination
our
artillery
having
fired
two
rounds
of
grape
the
two
battalions
of
infantry
entered
the
city
at
the
charge
and
regardless
of
the
terrible
fire
from
the
windows
of
the
houses
they
reached
the
of
the
town
the
enemy
was
in
consternation
and
the
taking
of
a
hundred
prisoners
by
us
showed
the
disorder
into
which
he
had
already
fallen
if
but
two
other
battalions
had
been
sent
to
support
those
which
had
entered
the
town
the
attack
would
have
ended
here
but
this
was
neglected
and
the
latter
were
remaining
in
their
dangerous
situation
while
the
rest
of
our
forces
were
uselessly
engaged
and
received
no
orders
the
bold
idea
of
the
brave
colonel
pientka
of
forcing
the
attack
was
no
where
seconded
the
corps
of
general
dembinski
remained
wholly
inactive
although
officers
were
occasionally
sent
by
him
to
general
chlapowski
for
orders
by
this
fault
the
battalions
who
had
entered
the
city
were
exposed
to
the
superior
forces
of
the
enemy
who
falling
upon
them
from
all
sides
forced
them
to
quit
the
city
leaving
among
their
dead
the
brave
colonels
jeroma
and
piwecki
and
nearly
one
half
of
their
whole
number
with
the
retreat
of
these
brave
battalions
all
our
forces
commenced
evacuating
their
position
we
can
not
tell
for
what
reason
the
enemy
did
not
attack
us
on
the
contrary
he
was
well
satisfied
with
the
cessation
of
hostilities
on
our
part
at
our
corps
recommenced
its
march
these
are
the
details
of
the
battle
or
rather
the
attack
of
szawla
which
town
we
quitted
after
investing
it
for
nearly
five
hours
and
after
having
sustained
a
severe
loss
in
men
and
officers
a
sacrifice
which
was
owing
to
our
most
defective
and
arrangements
on
this
same
day
we
were
again
unfortunate
in
the
loss
of
all
our
baggage
and
several
wagons
of
ammunition
which
were
sent
forward
by
a
road
on
our
right
and
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
light
circassian
cavalry
of
the
enemy
this
battle
discovered
an
extreme
of
negligence
in
our
commander
in
chief
with
the
knowledge
that
the
enemy
was
pursuing
us
in
the
rear
and
on
each
side
we
remained
uselessly
encamped
during
the
night
of
the
which
we
ought
to
have
employed
in
the
attack
the
true
course
should
have
been
to
have
set
fire
to
the
place
which
would
have
required
only
the
agency
of
a
few
bold
men
this
town
indeed
deserved
no
better
fate
for
it
was
inhabited
almost
exclusively
by
hostile
jews
when
the
general
welfare
is
at
risk
there
should
be
no
hesitation
in
sacrificing
the
convenience
of
individuals
if
we
compare
the
consequences
of
having
burnt
this
town
and
of
having
attacked
it
we
shall
see
that
by
the
former
course
we
should
have
compelled
the
jews
to
fly
with
their
effects
and
the
russian
garrison
to
surrender
without
any
effusion
of
blood
while
by
attacking
it
we
lost
nearly
one
thousand
men
without
any
advantage
whatever
in
regard
to
the
attack
the
surrounding
of
the
town
was
a
great
fault
for
neither
the
fire
of
the
artillery
nor
of
the
light
troops
could
be
effective
as
the
russian
artillery
was
in
a
dominant
position
and
was
concealed
within
the
city
as
their
infantry
was
behind
their
entrenchments
the
skirmishers
in
approaching
the
city
fell
without
having
harmed
the
enemy
the
plan
of
colonel
pientka
of
masking
the
attack
on
one
side
and
forcing
the
attack
upon
the
other
at
a
single
point
was
well
conceived
but
failed
as
we
have
seen
by
the
want
of
support
at
about
ten
the
flanking
parties
of
the
russian
cavalry
began
to
show
themselves
on
each
side
of
us
upon
the
road
to
wilkomierz
and
on
that
of
cytowiany
our
corps
was
already
on
the
march
for
kurszany
the
regiment
of
lancers
and
the
light
artillery
were
designated
as
a
this
taking
advantage
of
a
small
defile
which
presented
a
favorable
position
took
post
there
and
sustained
themselves
for
some
hours
against
an
attack
from
the
russian
advanced
guard
thus
protecting
the
march
of
our
main
body
which
was
executed
with
the
greatest
order
the
lancers
and
light
artillery
then
evacuated
their
position
by
a
retreat
at
full
speed
which
by
taking
advantage
of
the
windings
of
the
road
and
the
vicinity
of
the
forests
they
were
able
to
effect
with
inconsiderable
loss
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
we
arrived
at
kurszany
on
the
next
day
we
remained
some
hours
in
that
place
to
hold
a
council
of
war
general
chlapowski
proposed
to
divide
our
forces
into
three
corps
each
to
act
independently
this
arrangement
was
carried
into
effect
and
our
forces
were
thus
distributed
the
corps
under
general
chlapowski
with
which
general
gielgud
remained
consisted
of
five
battalions
of
infantry
amounting
to
men
four
squadrons
of
the
regiment
of
lancers
and
two
squadrons
of
kaliszian
cavalry
in
all
horse
and
an
artillery
consisting
of
pieces
of
cannon
this
corps
received
the
destination
to
march
for
rosseyny
leaving
the
enemy
on
the
right
and
from
thence
directly
for
kowno
and
by
this
unsuspected
march
to
surprise
the
last
important
position
by
that
means
the
communication
between
us
and
poland
would
be
and
to
protect
this
communication
was
to
be
the
principal
employment
of
that
corps
the
corps
under
the
command
of
generals
rohland
and
szymanowski
was
composed
of
eight
battalions
of
infantry
amounting
to
about
men
all
the
cavalry
which
was
recently
formed
in
lithuania
consisting
of
nearly
horse
and
an
artillery
commanded
by
the
brave
colonel
pientka
consisting
of
pieces
of
cannon
this
corps
was
directed
to
march
upon
polonga
a
port
on
the
baltic
it
had
been
rumored
that
two
french
vessels
with
arms
funds
and
ammunition
together
with
a
small
body
of
volunteers
were
cruising
near
that
port
after
they
should
have
received
these
expected
supplies
the
corps
was
directed
to
march
towards
the
dwina
and
by
following
along
the
banks
of
that
river
to
observe
and
interrupt
the
communications
between
the
forces
of
the
enemy
in
lithuania
and
the
province
of
courland
the
corps
under
general
dembinski
was
composed
of
three
battalions
of
infantry
of
the
regiment
recently
formed
consisting
of
about
men
two
squadrons
of
the
lancers
of
poznan
two
squadrons
of
the
lancers
of
plock
and
one
squadron
of
the
regiment
of
hulans
in
all
about
cavalry
and
seven
pieces
of
artillery
this
corps
received
orders
to
march
for
the
environs
of
szawla
traversing
the
forests
and
leaving
the
enemy
on
the
right
from
thence
to
take
a
direction
to
wilkomierz
and
thence
to
the
environs
of
wilno
and
to
attack
that
city
if
circumstances
might
allow
of
it
and
then
to
manoeuvre
in
the
department
of
minsk
and
in
the
forests
of
bialystok
acting
there
in
support
of
the
insurrection
and
collecting
the
forces
of
the
insurgents
an
important
object
of
this
corps
was
to
support
a
communication
with
the
corps
of
general
chlapowski
this
plan
the
reader
will
observe
was
in
many
of
its
points
the
same
with
that
suggested
by
colonel
valentin
a
proper
reflection
upon
all
these
arrangements
would
convince
any
one
that
much
more
loss
than
advantage
was
to
be
anticipated
from
them
this
subdivision
of
the
force
was
in
fact
a
visionary
scheme
many
officers
openly
declared
their
opinions
to
this
effect
and
urged
that
in
our
critical
situation
almost
surrounded
as
we
were
by
a
hostile
force
so
superior
to
our
own
we
ought
not
to
form
any
new
projects
but
profiting
by
the
concentration
of
our
forces
to
redouble
the
rapidity
of
our
march
and
taking
advantage
of
the
forests
and
covered
roads
to
reach
poland
as
soon
as
possible
this
would
indeed
be
attended
with
difficulties
but
it
would
still
be
much
easier
of
execution
and
much
more
proper
to
be
attempted
than
the
plan
which
we
have
detailed
such
views
however
were
not
regarded
the
project
was
highly
colored
and
the
most
brilliant
successes
were
promised
to
follow
it
the
separation
of
the
corps
was
accordingly
ordered
and
our
fate
was
sealed

of

three
subdivisions

the
corps
took
the
road
designated
for
it
from
this
moment
commences
a
new
epoch
in
our
operations
in
lithuania
and
we
shall
give
a
separate
detail
of
the
proceedings
of
each
of
these
corps
commencing
with
that
of
general
rohland
which
was
in
the
line
of
the
pursuit
and
was
followed
by
his
whole
force
this
corps
quitting
kurszany
took
the
road
for
telze
on
the
night
of
the
it
arrived
at
powenduny
and
the
lake
of
worna
upon
the
road
it
was
joined
by
colonel
koss
who
had
been
sent
as
we
have
said
with
his
detachment
from
keydany
to
construct
a
bridge
over
the
niemen
and
who
had
extricated
himself
from
the
exposed
situation
in
which
this
attempt
had
placed
him
as
the
position
was
advantageous
and
as
our
soldiers
had
need
of
repose
after
their
fatiguing
march
we
remained
there
the
whole
night
on
the
next
day
at
sunrise
our
camp
was
alarmed
by
the
approach
of
the
circassian
cavalry
of
the
enemy
our
generals
decided
to
wait
the
enemy
attack
in
their
eligible
position
and
that
day
was
one
of
most
brilliant
success
we
will
present
to
the
reader
full
details
of
the
events
of
that
day
for
they
were
of
an
extremely
interesting
character
the
manoeuvres
of
all
our
forces
were
admirable
but
those
of
the
cavalry
were
indeed
extraordinary
the
reader
will
be
astonished
to
find
how
much
was
done
by
a
cavalry
fatigued
their
accoutrements
in
disorder
and
almost
without
ammunition
against
a
cavalry
like
that
of
the
enemy
well
mounted
with
fresh
horses
and
in
every
respect
in
perfect
order
combat
of
powenduny
and
worna
the
battle
commenced
at
sunrise
as
we
have
already
mentioned
with
an
attack
from
two
squadrons
of
circassian
cavalry
those
squadrons
turned
our
outer
guard
and
came
in
contact
with
our
tirailleurs
who
received
them
with
a
warm
and
unexpected
fire
these
tirailleurs
were
concealed
in
the
forest
and
the
circassians
halted
and
commenced
a
fire
of
carbines
in
return
our
fire
could
not
but
be
attended
with
great
loss
to
the
enemy
and
they
were
forced
to
retire
in
this
retreat
our
own
cavalry
which
was
at
powenduny
and
which
had
debouched
by
a
covered
road
and
taken
position
entirely
surrounded
these
two
squadrons
and
attacking
them
on
all
sides
causing
a
severe
loss
and
taking
forty
prisoners
an
hour
after
the
russians
renewed
the
attack
strong
columns
of
infantry
and
cavalry
passed
through
a
little
village
which
is
on
the
road
from
kurszany
to
powenduny
the
russian
artillery
took
positions
upon
the
declivity
of
the
heights
adjoining
that
village
and
commenced
a
fire
upon
our
cavalry
at
the
same
time
several
columns
of
the
russian
infantry
threw
themselves
into
the
on
the
right
of
our
position
while
a
strong
detachment
composed
of
infantry
artillery
and
cavalry
was
pushed
forward
upon
our
right
wing
with
the
design
to
turn
our
flank
and
by
surrounding
us
to
cut
off
our
communications
with
worna
this
detachment
after
losing
several
hours
in
attempting
to
act
upon
us
under
the
obstacles
which
were
presented
by
the
marshy
nature
of
the
ground
returned
without
having
effected
any
thing
our
generals
seeing
the
superior
force
of
the
enemy
ordered
our
cavalry
to
retire
and
to
place
themselves
in
the
rear
of
our
artillery
which
occupied
heights
commanding
the
whole
vicinity
and
arrested
by
an
incessant
fire
for
more
than
four
hours
the
advance
of
the
enemy
after
our
cavalry
had
retired
the
tirailleurs
began
to
evacuate
the
wood
and
concentrating
themselves
upon
the
road
to
powenduny
retired
also
after
having
destroyed
the
bridge
which
crosses
a
small
marshy
stream
intersecting
the
road
and
burnt
a
faubourg
which
adjoins
powenduny
and
was
near
this
bridge
such
was
the
state
of
things
when
at
about
ten
a
flag
was
announced
from
the
russian
commander
it
was
brought
by
an
of
general
delinghausen
the
proposition
borne
by
this
flag
was
that
we
should
surrender
on
the
ground
that
we
were
engaged
with
the
whole
of
the
russian
force
amounting
to
nearly
men
and
that
that
force
had
already
occupied
the
road
to
worna
the
only
communication
which
remained
to
us
this
proposition
was
followed
by
the
usual
considerations
the
wish
to
prevent
the
needless
effusion
of
blood
it
was
declined
and
the
returned
to
the
russian
but
in
a
short
time
appeared
again
with
a
renewal
of
the
proposition
general
szymanowski
who
received
the
persisted
in
his
refusal
adding
that
knew
the
duties
of
a
soldier
duties
which
were
doubly
obligatory
upon
one
who
is
fighting
in
the
cause
of
liberty
and
in
the
defence
of
the
country
of
his
ancestors
after
the
departure
of
the
the
order
was
given
to
the
artillery
and
infantry
to
their
fire
at
the
same
time
arrangements
were
made
for
the
continuation
of
our
march
to
worna
at
about
our
columns
of
infantry
and
a
part
of
the
cavalry
and
artillery
quitted
their
position
and
took
up
the
march
for
worna
after
a
short
time
there
remained
but
one
battalion
of
infantry
and
three
squadrons
of
cavalry
the
cavalry
was
employed
to
mask
the
withdrawing
of
the
remaining
artillery
after
our
corps
had
by
a
march
arranged
in
the
manner
we
have
described
reached
a
point
sufficiently
distant
from
our
first
position
the
battalion
of
light
infantry
which
remained
in
that
position
was
ordered
to
withdraw
as
far
as
certain
mills
keeping
up
a
retreating
fire
after
passing
those
mills
the
tirailleurs
received
orders
to
run
at
full
speed
to
rejoin
the
corps
and
to
occupy
the
adjoining
forests
while
the
cavalry
were
ordered
to
take
post
at
the
mills
to
cover
this
movement
and
afterwards
to
retire
slowly
pass
a
small
village
which
was
on
the
road
and
on
the
opposite
side
of
that
village
to
await
the
approach
of
the
enemy
this
manoeuvre
was
well
executed
by
both
the
infantry
and
cavalry
the
latter
placing
themselves
on
rather
an
open
space
behind
the
village
to
await
the
enemy
after
some
time
six
squadrons
of
the
light
russian
cavalry
consisting
of
hussars
and
circassians
passed
through
the
village
and
seeing
the
small
number
of
our
cavalry
gave
the
hurrah
and
threw
themselves
upon
them
our
cavalry
expecting
this
attack
received
orders
to
quit
their
position
with
promptness
in
order
to
lead
the
russian
cavalry
upon
the
fire
of
our
infantry
who
were
concealed
in
the
woods
the
russian
cavalry
presuming
that
this
was
a
disorderly
retreat
followed
with
impetuosity
while
our
cavalry
threw
themselves
on
one
side
to
pass
a
ford
which
had
been
designated
for
that
object
and
thus
left
the
enemy
exposed
in
a
mass
to
the
fire
of
our
tirailleurs
the
manoeuvre
cost
the
russians
two
hundred
men
by
the
acknowledgment
of
officers
who
were
made
prisoners
after
having
caused
this
severe
loss
to
the
enemy
our
infantry
and
cavalry
retired
slowly
to
occupy
their
third
position
and
the
enemy
did
not
follow
a
short
time
after
we
quitted
our
second
position
the
russian
cavalry
showed
themselves
again
general
szymanowski
remained
with
two
companies
of
the
regiment
of
the
line
to
defend
the
passage
of
the
third
village
against
the
enemy
and
to
give
time
to
our
cavalry
to
take
a
third
position
this
general
for
nearly
an
hour
resisted
the
attack
of
a
strong
force
of
cavalry
but
commenced
evacuating
the
position
on
the
approach
of
considerable
bodies
of
the
russian
infantry
withdrawing
through
the
forests
the
russian
cavalry
seeing
that
the
village
was
abandoned
by
our
infantry
began
to
debouch
through
it
it
was
an
act
of
the
greatest
imprudence
in
the
russian
cavalry
unsupported
by
either
infantry
or
artillery
to
advance
thus
upon
a
plain
surrounded
by
forests
in
which
they
might
have
supposed
infantry
and
even
cavalry
to
be
concealed
two
squadrons
of
our
cavalry
commenced
a
fire
in
order
to
harass
them
and
draw
them
on
to
the
middle
of
the
plain
afterwards
those
two
squadrons
wheeling
about
laid
open
the
russian
cavalry
to
the
fire
of
our
artillery
which
was
posted
on
a
little
elevation
and
concealed
by
this
fire
of
our
artillery
was
effective
the
enemy
cavalry
began
to
waver
general
szymanowski
observing
this
ordered
an
immediate
attack
by
our
whole
cavalry
consisting
of
twelve
squadrons
this
attack
was
made
with
great
impetuosity
sixteen
hussars
with
two
officers
were
taken
prisoners
and
forty
or
fifty
were
left
killed
or
wounded
on
the
field
after
this
the
corps
recommenced
its
march
to
worna
leaving
two
battalions
of
the
regiment
of
infantry
as
a
in
the
forests
which
border
on
that
road
the
successes
which
we
had
thus
obtained
in
our
three
first
positions
were
over
the
advanced
guard
of
the
enemy
but
in
the
fourth
position
arranged
by
the
brave
and
skilful
colonel
koss
and
in
which
our
successes
were
even
greater
we
had
to
encounter
the
whole
body
of
the
russian
forces
in
lithuania
which
according
to
some
of
our
prisoners
were
to
be
estimated
at
and
by
others
at
men
with
pieces
of
artillery
under
the
command
of
the
several
russian
generals
kreutz
tolstoy
szyrman
delinghausen
and
saken
the
town
of
worna
is
surrounded
by
two
large
lakes
in
such
a
manner
that
the
only
communication
with
that
town
to
the
west
is
by
a
neck
of
land
separating
the
extremities
of
those
two
lakes
the
town
is
situated
upon
an
elevated
ground
which
overlooks
the
whole
vicinity
on
our
left
wing
was
a
forest
that
reached
one
of
the
lakes
this
forest
was
occupied
by
two
battalions
of
infantry
our
right
wing
leaned
upon
the
other
lake
all
our
artillery
remained
in
the
centre
and
occupied
the
heights
near
worna
when
our
arrangements
were
completed
we
heard
the
fire
of
the
two
battalions
composing
our
who
were
engaged
while
withdrawing
with
the
russian
infantry
strong
columns
of
the
infantry
which
were
following
these
battalions
began
to
debouch
from
the
forest
and
to
deploy
upon
the
plains
before
worna
those
columns
were
followed
by
the
enemy
artillery
pieces
of
which
took
post
on
the
side
of
the
road
and
immediately
opened
a
fire
upon
our
centre
at
the
same
time
a
warm
fire
of
skirmishers
was
commenced
on
each
side
our
artillery
which
was
very
advantageously
placed
without
replying
to
that
of
the
enemy
opened
a
fire
upon
the
columns
of
the
enemy
infantry
before
night
the
whole
russian
forces
had
deployed
upon
the
plain
and
a
powerful
attack
on
their
side
was
expected
but
instead
of
this
we
were
astonished
to
find
that
their
fire
began
to
slacken
perhaps
owing
to
a
heavy
rain
which
had
just
began
to
fall
our
commander
with
the
view
to
profit
by
this
rain
and
the
approach
of
darkness
after
an
interval
of
not
more
than
ten
minutes
ordered
the
two
battalions
which
remained
in
the
forests
on
our
left
to
make
a
sudden
charge
with
the
bayonet
upon
the
right
wing
of
the
enemy
these
battalions
under
the
command
of
the
brave
colonel
michalowski
performed
prodigies
of
valor
in
this
charge
and
bore
down
all
before
them
colonel
koss
at
the
same
time
taking
the
command
of
the
cavalry
and
addressing
a
few
exciting
words
to
them
led
them
upon
the
centre
of
the
enemy
at
the
charge
the
consternation
of
the
russians
was
extreme
a
great
part
of
their
cavalry
was
found
dismounted
for
they
had
not
the
least
expectation
of
an
attack
their
artillery
fled
and
abandoned
their
cannon
the
utmost
disorder
followed
and
a
vast
number
of
the
enemy
fell
upon
the
field
according
to
the
testimony
of
prisoners
the
consternation
was
at
such
a
height
that
we
might
have
put
their
whole
corps
to
rout
our
forces
however
could
not
follow
up
these
advantages
for
the
obscurity
of
the
night
and
our
own
weakness
made
it
impossible
we
were
content
with
having
reduced
the
strength
of
the
enemy
by
the
great
losses
we
had
occasioned
and
we
continued
our
route
towards
the
seaport
of
polonga
agreeably
to
our
orders
where
we
were
looking
for
reinforcements
and
where
our
generals
believed
that
the
corps
of
general
chlapowski
would
join
and
act
with
us
upon
some
new
plan
on
the
morning
of
the
we
arrived
at
retow
the
battle
of
powenduny
and
worna
in
which
we
had
beaten
the
russians
in
four
positions
and
which
cost
the
enemy
more
than
a
thousand
men
including
prisoners
and
wounded
renewed
our
hopes
we
were
expecting
as
we
have
said
new
accessions
of
strength
at
polonga
and
we
were
not
without
hope
that
our
other
corps
under
dembinski
and
chlapowski
who
could
not
have
been
far
distant
finding
that
we
had
been
thus
engaged
and
so
successfully
with
the
whole
force
of
the
enemy
would
change
their
plan
of
operations
and
attack
him
in
his
rear
or
his
flank
to
this
end
in
fact
on
the
very
morning
of
that
battle
after
our
first
successes
we
sent
two
officers
in
the
direction
of
dembinski
and
chlapowski
to
apprize
them
of
the
circumstances
in
which
we
were
placed
and
especially
to
inform
them
of
the
important
fact
that
the
whole
force
of
the
enemy
were
before
us
with
these
hopes
awakened
in
our
minds
our
disappointment
may
be
imagined
on
learning
at
retow
that
the
corps
of
general
chlapowski
had
passed
through
that
place
on
the
day
before
in
a
rapid
march
towards
the
prussian
frontier
during
the
battle
of
powenduny
therefore
the
corps
of
general
chlapowski
was
at
the
distance
of
only
from
us
he
heard
our
fire
during
the
whole
day
but
instead
of
marching
to
our
support
which
as
we
afterwards
learnt
his
officers
and
even
his
soldiers
loudly
called
upon
him
to
do
he
declined
doing
it
answering
their
appeals
in
the
following
terms
what
do
you
ask
of
me
gentlemen
i
can
assure
you
that
the
corps
of
general
rohland
on
whom
the
whole
force
of
the
enemy
has
fallen
is
destroyed
the
baggage
of
his
officers
have
passed
through
retow
all
is
lost
and
surrounded
as
we
are
on
all
sides
by
the
enemy
it
only
remains
for
us
to
seek
at
once
the
frontiers
of
prussia
and
to
throw
ourselves
upon
the
protection
of
that
power
generals
rohland
and
szymanowski
on
receiving
the
unwelcome
intelligence
of
the
course
which
general
chlapowski
had
adopted
concluded
to
change
their
plan
of
operations
and
instead
of
going
to
polonga
to
follow
the
march
of
general
chlapowski
to
endeavor
to
join
him
as
soon
as
possible
and
by
exhibiting
to
him
the
unimpaired
strength
of
our
corps
which
he
had
believed
to
be
annihilated
to
induce
him
to
abandon
the
project
of
crossing
the
prussian
frontier
and
to
make
some
farther
attempts
in
junction
with
us
with
this
view
after
resting
a
few
hours
at
retow
we
left
by
a
forced
march
for
gorzdy
a
small
town
near
the
prussian
frontier
at
which
we
hoped
to
overtake
the
corps
of
general
chlapowski
and
at
which
we
arrived
on
the
next
day
at
noon
but
it
was
already
too
late
the
greater
part
of
the
corps
of
chlapowski
and
gielgud
had
passed
the
frontier
at
the
village
of
czarna
about
a
half
league
from
the
former
place
and
an
inconsiderable
part
only
of
the
corps
which
had
not
yet
passed
over
could
unite
with
us
the
other
part
were
already
advanced
a
considerable
distance
within
the
prussian
territory
and
having
been
disarmed
were
placed
under
a
guard
of
prussian
sentinels
such
was
the
end
of
the
corps
of
generals
chlapowski
and
gielgud
composed
of
our
best
troops
and
which
had
performed
such
feats
of
valor
in
so
many
battles
those
brave
soldiers
were
led
against
their
will
into
the
territory
of
a
foreign
nation
to
seek
a
protection
of
which
they
themselves
had
not
even
dreamed
this
step
which
every
historian
of
our
revolution
will
record
with
horror
when
it
was
seen
how
totally
without
justification
it
was
awakened
the
disgust
and
indignation
of
all
the
part
of
the
corps
of
general
chlapowski
which
was
already
in
the
prussian
territory
when
they
saw
the
corps
of
general
rohland
which
they
had
been
made
to
believe
was
destroyed
continuing
its
march
in
an
entire
state
and
even
with
nearly
russian
prisoners
in
its
train
and
hearing
too
the
animating
shouts
which
naturally
burst
from
their
comrades
as
they
came
in
view
of
them
and
who
called
on
them
to
rejoin
them
fell
into
a
state
of
the
utmost
exasperation
a
great
number
rushed
forward
and
breaking
through
the
prussian
guard
unarmed
as
they
were
reached
our
side
of
the
frontier
the
brave
commander
of
the
light
artillery
who
was
already
on
the
prussian
territory
with
his
battery
profiting
by
the
circumstance
that
his
horses
were
not
yet
unharnessed
returned
and
joined
our
corps
with
five
pieces
of
cannon
both
officers
and
soldiers
surrounded
general
gielgud
and
loudly
demanded
some
explanation
of
this
state
of
things
that
general
betrayed
the
utmost
confusion
and
seemed
wholly
at
a
loss
to
satisfy
these
demands
his
manner
indeed
was
such
as
to
encourage
the
suspicions
of
treason
which
his
previous
conduct
had
but
too
well
justified
at
this
moment
one
of
his
officers
in
a
frenzy
of
patriotic
indignation
advanced
towards
him
drew
a
pistol
from
his
side
and
exclaiming
is
the
reward
of
a
traitor
shot
him
through
the
heart
after
this
sad
event
general
chlapowski
was
sought
after
and
the
same
fate
would
have
probably
awaited
him
had
he
not
succeeded
in
concealing
himself
a
scene
of
great
confusion
then
took
place
throughout
the
corps
general
rohland
and
the
other
officers
exerted
themselves
to
tranquillize
the
soldiers
reminding
them
that
our
situation
was
critical
and
that
the
russians
were
pressing
upon
us
these
appeals
had
the
effect
of
restoring
quiet
and
at
about
the
corps
of
general
rohland
joined
by
a
part
of
that
of
chlapowski
took
up
the
march
in
the
direction
of
yurburg
in
order
to
pass
the
niemen
there
and
attempt
to
reach
poland
at
night
we
arrived
at
wierzbna
after
having
marched
four
miles
from
the
spot
where
the
prussian
frontier
was
passed
by
general
chlapowski
we
were
met
by
an
of
general
kreutz
sent
with
a
flag
of
truce
and
bearing
a
letter
to
general
rohland
which
was
read
aloud
containing
propositions
to
surrender
and
setting
forth
the
circumstances
under
which
we
were
placed
in
declining
the
proposition
general
rohland
among
other
expressions
used
the
following
strength
of
your
forces
is
well
known
to
us
we
have
seen
them
at
powenduny
and
worna
if
providence
protected
us
there
it
will
still
protect
us
and
turning
towards
the
officers
of
his
suite
he
added
look
on
my
grey
hairs
they
have
become
blanched
in
a
service
of
thirty
years
under
the
polish
eagles
and
during
that
whole
period
i
have
endeavored
to
keep
the
path
of
honor
and
duty
permit
me
in
my
old
age
to
continue
in
that
path
the
answer
having
been
communicated
to
the
corps
the
cry
of
life
to
rohland
burst
forth
on
every
side
the
departed
and
we
continued
our
route
having
passed
the
night
at
wierzbna
we
arrived
on
the
noon
of
the
next
day
the
at
at
which
place
we
put
to
flight
a
squadron
of
russian
cavalry
posted
there
before
reaching
that
town
and
at
the
distance
of
about
a
half
league
from
it
our
cavalry
had
a
small
skirmish
with
four
squadrons
of
the
russian
light
cavalry
this
cavalry
fell
upon
a
small
detachment
of
our
sappers
which
had
been
detailed
for
the
object
of
destroying
a
bridge
upon
a
branch
of
the
main
road
at
the
distance
of
about
a
mile
from
it
the
sappers
in
withdrawing
kept
up
a
fire
and
thus
drew
the
enemy
on
till
our
cavalry
falling
upon
them
dispersed
them
causing
a
considerable
loss
and
taking
several
prisoners
on
arriving
at
our
commander
sent
a
reconnoitering
party
in
the
direction
of
yurburg
in
order
to
ascertain
if
any
of
the
enemy
forces
were
there
and
considering
the
strong
position
of
he
decided
to
remain
there
and
to
await
the
result
of
this
reconnoissance
our
forces
were
placed
in
order
of
battle
to
await
the
enemy
in
case
he
should
choose
to
make
an
attack
remaining
for
two
hours
in
this
position
we
were
astonished
that
the
enemy
did
not
show
himself
and
a
platoon
of
cavalry
sent
in
the
direction
of
the
enemy
to
observe
him
returned
with
the
intelligence
that
he
was
at
the
distance
of
two
miles
from
us
four
hours
had
thus
passed
when
the
arrival
of
a
prussian
officer
upon
the
frontier
was
announced
who
requested
an
interview
with
our
general
general
rohland
accompanied
with
a
party
of
officers
went
to
receive
him
the
prussian
officer
was
an
of
the
commandant
general
of
the
forces
on
this
part
of
the
frontier
general
kraft
we
believe
the
officer
after
some
complimentary
language
presented
a
letter
from
his
commander
which
was
filled
with
expressions
of
respect
and
good
will
and
in
which
it
was
proposed
that
in
consideration
of
our
position
surrounded
as
we
were
by
a
force
so
much
superior
to
our
own
and
in
a
state
of
destitution
in
respect
to
arms
and
ammunition
we
should
accept
the
offer
which
the
prussian
government
had
authorised
him
to
make
in
order
to
save
the
useless
effusion
of
the
blood
of
so
many
brave
men
and
throw
ourselves
upon
the
protection
of
its
territory
where
we
would
be
convinced
of
the
cordial
disposition
of
that
government
towards
us
adding
that
our
sojourn
there
would
be
short
and
that
we
should
soon
be
allowed
to
return
to
our
firesides
as
was
the
case
with
the
russian
soldiers
who
had
sought
the
same
protection
we
have
already
mentioned
that
several
detachments
of
russian
soldiers
who
had
before
sought
the
protection
of
prussia
had
been
allowed
to
return
with
their
arms
and
ammunition
our
generals
on
being
thus
apprised
of
the
liberal
intentions
of
the
prussian
government
which
were
confirmed
by
the
personal
representations
of
the
officer
who
brought
the
letter
reflecting
on
the
deplorable
state
of
our
soldiers
fatigued
and
weakened
by
so
many
forced
marches
the
greater
part
of
the
infantry
being
without
covering
to
their
feet
which
were
lacerated
with
wounds
the
greater
part
of
the
cavalry
almost
without
horses
for
their
animals
were
so
broken
down
and
chafed
by
unremitted
use
as
to
be
unfit
for
service
both
artillery
and
infantry
nearly
destitute
of
ammunition
a
great
quantity
of
which
had
been
thrown
into
the
river
by
the
orders
of
generals
gielgud
and
chlapowski
on
passing
the
frontier
considering
also
the
assurance
which
had
been
made
that
we
could
return
to
our
country
and
hoping
therefore
to
be
able
to
renew
their
services
to
that
country
at
some
more
favorable
period
presented
these
circumstances
to
the
whole
corps
and
solicited
the
opinion
of
the
soldiers
upon
the
question
of
acceding
to
the
propositions
of
the
prussian
government
the
soldiers
manifesting
their
entire
confidence
in
the
judgment
and
the
honor
of
their
officers
signified
their
assent
to
the
acceptance
of
the
propositions
influenced
strongly
by
the
assurance
of
being
allowed
to
return
to
their
country
in
consequence
of
this
assent
a
protocol
was
prepared
that
night
and
signed
by
our
generals
and
by
several
prussian
officers
on
the
other
part
who
came
over
for
that
object
on
the
morning
of
the
next
day
we
passed
the
frontier
and
marched
into
the
prussian
territory
and
by
that
act
the
operations
of
the
lithuanian
corps
were
ended

frenzy
of
indignation
which
such
an
experience
had
justified
they
allowed
themselves
to
be
carried
away
by
their
feelings
and
to
be
guilty
of
acts
of
severity
it
can
scarcely
be
wondered
at
immediately
after
the
arrival
of
the
sad
news
from
lithuania
the
nation
demanded
explanations
of
the
generalissimo
they
demanded
to
know
how
he
could
have
given
the
command
of
so
important
an
expedition
to
a
man
like
gielgud
one
who
had
never
been
esteemed
by
the
nation
or
the
army
and
who
had
not
even
the
reputation
of
a
general
of
talent
how
could
an
expedition
which
demanded
the
very
highest
talents
and
the
most
undoubted
patriotism
have
been
confided
to
a
man
like
him
with
him
had
been
associated
general
chlapowski
who
was
the
of
the
grand
duke
constantine
that
circumstance
alone
they
justly
considered
should
have
been
enough
to
suggest
suspicion
and
to
have
at
least
indicated
the
expediency
of
keeping
him
near
the
eye
of
the
commander
in
chief
and
subject
to
his
constant
observation
such
were
the
complaints
of
the
people
and
they
went
to
the
heart
of
the
commander
in
chief
and
the
president
of
the
national
government
for
they
were
conscious
but
too
late
of
their
justice
the
russian
army
the
command
of
which
on
the
death
of
general
diebitsch
was
taken
by
general
count
paszkewicz
and
the
main
body
of
which
remained
in
a
state
of
inaction
at
ostrolenka
having
no
longer
any
apprehensions
from
lithuania
could
now
act
with
freedom
and
the
offensive
was
recommenced
under
the
command
of
its
new
chief
who
decided
to
pass
the
vistula
and
to
act
upon
the
left
bank
i
may
be
allowed
to
detain
the
attention
of
the
reader
a
moment
upon
this
passage
of
the
vistula
by
paszkewicz
a
manoeuvre
of
which
so
much
boast
has
been
made
and
to
consider
whether
it
is
really
to
be
regarded
as
a
great
and
bold
step
or
one
of
necessity
what
was
the
state
of
the
russian
army
after
the
battle
of
ostrolenka
a
month
had
passed
and
that
army
had
not
made
a
single
movement
but
was
kept
there
merely
to
be
fed
by
prussia
was
not
this
inactivity
an
infallible
evidence
of
weakness
does
it
not
show
that
alarmed
by
the
prospects
in
lithuania
it
was
in
a
state
of
hesitation
not
daring
to
advance
into
the
kingdom
and
holding
itself
in
readiness
to
evacuate
it
on
an
occasion
of
necessity
which
indeed
seemed
near
at
hand
in
this
period
of
hesitation
the
new
general
arrives
from
the
regions
of
the
caucasus
he
must
do
something
the
question
presents
itself
to
him
what
course
is
best
to
be
taken
his
army
now
reinforced
by
the
corps
which
had
been
in
lithuania
amounted
to
perhaps
near
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
although
this
force
was
considerable
yet
to
attack
the
fortifications
of
praga
which
as
is
known
to
the
reader
had
been
augmented
and
which
the
russian
army
in
their
primitive
and
unimpaired
strength
had
never
had
the
temerity
to
attack
was
out
of
the
question
what
other
course
could
he
take
unless
he
could
submit
to
continue
in
this
state
of
inactivity
but
to
pass
the
vistula
and
under
the
assistance
of
prussia
to
make
his
attempts
against
warsaw
on
the
other
side
a
step
however
which
he
never
would
have
dared
to
have
taken
without
that
assistance
this
is
the
natural
explanation
of
that
boasted
plan
in
which
we
can
see
nothing
but
an
almost
necessary
movement
encouraged
by
a
reliance
on
prussia
in
the
first
days
of
the
month
of
june
the
russian
army
began
to
approach
the
vistula
in
order
to
execute
the
passage
their
march
was
in
three
principal
columns
and
was
arranged
in
the
following
manner
general
witt
commanding
the
columns
of
the
left
wing
took
the
direction
of
sochoczyn
the
centre
under
marshal
paszkewicz
left
for
sonk
and
luberacz
passing
the
river
wkra
at
maluszyn
the
column
of
the
right
consisting
of
the
imperial
guard
under
the
command
of
the
grand
duke
michael
marched
from
makow
by
ciechanow
and
racionz
general
pablen
commanded
the
advanced
guard
a
considerable
train
of
ammunition
with
provisions
for
twenty
days
and
a
park
of
artillery
of
reserve
formed
the
fourth
column
and
followed
the
imperial
guard
detached
posts
towards
modlin
and
serock
covered
this
march
on
the
left
one
regiment
of
dragoons
remained
at
pultusk
this
combined
force
consisted
of
men
and
three
hundred
pieces
of
cannon
besides
these
forces
there
were
in
the
kingdom
the
corps
of
general
rudiger
at
kaluszyn
and
that
of
general
rott
at
zamosc
those
two
corps
might
now
number
about
men
and
some
thirty
pieces
of
cannon
opposed
to
these
forces
we
had
an
army
of
men
a
hundred
and
twenty
pieces
of
cannon
not
counting
the
national
guard
of
warsaw
and
the
garrisons
of
the
two
fortresses
of
modlin
and
zamosc
the
plan
of
our
generalissimo
was
to
throw
himself
upon
the
detached
corps
of
the
enemy
under
rott
and
rudiger
and
afterwards
to
act
upon
his
main
body
for
this
end
an
attack
was
ordered
upon
the
corps
of
rudiger
which
was
beaten
in
the
environs
of
minsk
by
the
corps
of
general
chrzanowski
in
successive
actions
on
the
and
of
july
a
third
part
of
his
corps
being
destroyed
a
thousand
prisoners
four
pieces
of
cannon
and
all
his
baggage
taken
he
was
forced
to
retire
behind
kaluszyn
after
these
new
advantages
the
general
in
chief
prepared
to
act
upon
the
rear
of
the
russian
main
army
and
to
attack
them
while
engaged
in
the
passage
of
the
vistula
which
he
supposed
they
would
attempt
either
at
plock
or
between
plock
and
modlin
but
as
he
was
afterwards
apprized
that
the
russians
were
to
attempt
the
passage
at
a
much
more
distant
point
from
warsaw
and
beyond
his
reach
while
on
the
right
bank
he
thought
it
most
expedient
to
pass
the
vistula
at
warsaw
and
to
operate
against
the
enemy
on
the
other
side
the
russian
army
thus
passed
the
vistula
without
being
intercepted
between
the
and
the
of
july
having
reached
the
left
bank
the
enemy
took
the
direction
of
lowicz
where
on
the
the
of
general
paszkewicz
were
established
and
whither
our
army
marched
to
meet
him
at
this
important
moment
when
the
operations
of
the
enemy
had
taken
a
new
face
and
seemed
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
by
his
near
approach
to
warsaw
to
menace
the
utmost
danger
made
more
threatening
in
their
imaginations
by
the
recent
discovery
of
the
conspiracy
of
jankowski
and
the
news
of
the
misfortunes
in
lithuania
at
this
anxious
moment
the
nation
demanded
a
council
of
war
and
called
on
the
national
government
to
make
an
inquisition
into
the
conduct
of
the
general
in
chief
to
demand
of
him
full
explanations
of
his
purposes
and
a
submission
of
all
his
plans
of
operation
to
the
examination
of
such
a
council
such
a
council
of
war
was
instituted
by
the
government
and
directed
to
be
attached
to
the
person
of
the
general
and
to
be
initiated
into
all
his
designs
in
order
to
be
enabled
to
tranquillize
and
the
minds
of
the
nation
which
had
so
naturally
become
distrustful
and
suspicious
after
the
events
which
had
taken
place
the
council
having
been
organized
and
having
taken
an
oath
of
secrecy
general
skrzynecki
laid
before
them
all
the
plans
of
operation
that
he
had
hitherto
followed
as
well
as
those
which
he
had
in
contemplation
and
gave
a
full
exposition
of
the
reasons
for
each
this
council
then
published
to
the
nation
an
address
announcing
their
entire
confidence
in
the
patriotic
intentions
of
the
general
in
chief
and
assuring
them
that
the
crisis
was
by
no
means
as
dangerous
as
they
apprehended
by
these
proceedings
the
minds
of
the
people
were
much
tranquillized
and
this
tranquillity
was
increased
by
the
arrival
of
the
corps
of
general
dembinski
from
lithuania
after
its
glorious
retreat
which
arrival
not
only
cheered
them
by
the
addition
which
it
brought
to
our
forces
but
by
the
more
encouraging
accounts
than
had
before
been
received
which
it
gave
of
the
state
of
lithuania
authorizing
some
hope
of
a
renewal
of
the
insurrection
in
that
province
at
a
more
propitious
hour
footnotes
footnote
a
few
details
of
the
history
of
the
two
generals
who
were
the
cause
of
these
fatal
disasters
may
gratify
the
curiosity
of
the
reader
general
gielgud
was
born
in
lithuania
at
gielgudyszki
the
place
at
which
he
crossed
the
niemen
in
passing
over
his
early
life
which
presents
nothing
noticeable
he
commenced
his
military
career
in
when
napoleon
entered
lithuania
in
a
moment
of
patriotic
fervor
he
formed
a
small
detachment
at
his
own
expense
and
joined
the
ranks
of
the
supposed
deliverer
of
poland
and
this
perhaps
was
the
most
act
of
his
life
during
the
campaign
of
and
he
was
in
no
way
distinguished
either
for
good
or
bad
conduct
at
the
end
of
the
russian
campaign
in
he
was
made
colonel
as
during
that
year
poland
came
under
the
russian
government
our
army
was
subjected
to
a
change
of
organization
and
as
many
officers
of
high
rank
who
were
in
independent
circumstances
gave
up
their
commands
gielgud
then
obtained
the
rank
of
general
at
about
the
age
of
thirty
this
rapid
advancement
as
was
natural
to
a
man
of
weak
character
inspired
him
with
an
extreme
of
arrogance
and
pretension
qualities
which
were
encouraged
in
his
intercourse
with
the
russian
generals
with
whom
he
was
much
associated
it
was
this
arrogance
which
uniformly
lost
him
the
esteem
of
those
under
his
command
when
the
revolution
broke
out
general
gielgud
was
at
the
town
of
radom
and
his
life
was
in
great
danger
from
the
suspicions
of
which
he
was
naturally
the
object
but
he
was
protected
by
some
of
the
patriots
on
the
assurances
which
he
gave
of
his
patriotic
dispositions
still
however
the
military
demanded
his
removal
from
his
post
and
in
fact
for
some
weeks
he
was
without
command
the
dictator
chlopicki
whose
modes
of
action
were
as
the
reader
knows
too
often
inexplicable
restored
him
to
his
command
persuading
himself
that
he
was
one
of
the
best
of
patriots
and
that
if
his
exterior
was
offensive
he
was
right
at
heart
in
the
war
having
first
commanded
a
brigade
and
afterwards
a
division
while
he
was
attached
to
the
grand
army
his
conduct
was
not
marked
by
any
very
great
faults
indeed
in
the
battle
of
minsk
he
performed
his
part
well
it
was
such
occasional
exhibitions
of
good
conduct
which
kept
him
in
some
consideration
after
having
taken
command
of
the
corps
of
lithuania
and
when
he
was
removed
from
the
observation
of
the
army
he
exhibited
himself
in
his
true
character
he
was
giddy
with
the
distinction
and
feeling
himself
the
absolute
master
of
his
own
conduct
he
gave
himself
up
to
all
the
suggestions
of
his
vanity
his
first
act
of
folly
was
to
surround
himself
with
a
numerous
suite
it
was
in
number
four
times
that
of
the
commander
in
chief
in
which
suite
those
individuals
were
held
in
greatest
esteem
who
were
most
fertile
in
resources
for
amusement
it
was
to
this
love
of
personal
gratification
that
we
can
attribute
those
delays
which
were
sacrificing
the
cause
of
the
country
at
gielgudyszki
the
general
gave
a
to
his
officers
and
it
is
not
impossible
that
it
was
a
motive
of
mere
personal
ostentation
which
induced
him
to
make
the
passage
of
the
niemen
at
that
place
by
which
two
days
march
were
given
to
the
retreating
enemy
time
was
allowed
him
to
concentrate
his
forces
in
wilno
and
that
capital
was
lost
to
us
this
general
was
never
seen
to
share
the
privations
fatigues
and
exposure
of
his
subalterns
in
his
personal
deportment
he
neglected
the
true
means
of
gaining
the
confidence
and
attachment
of
his
troops
on
the
eve
of
a
battle
in
moments
of
danger
and
anxiety
it
is
cheering
to
the
soldier
to
see
the
face
of
his
commander
and
to
hear
from
him
a
few
words
of
encouragement
these
are
apparent
trifles
but
they
are
in
reality
of
most
serious
consequence
they
are
the
secret
keys
by
which
every
thing
can
be
obtained
from
the
soldier
the
personal
attachment
of
the
soldier
to
his
commander
is
worth
more
than
the
finest
combinations
in
strategy
and
tactics
the
commander
who
succeeds
in
gaining
the
affection
of
the
soldier
inspires
him
with
a
new
impulse
for
exertion
to
his
other
motives
is
added
the
dread
of
forfeiting
the
confidence
and
esteem
of
a
friend
and
perhaps
with
the
mass
of
an
army
such
a
motive
would
yield
to
no
other
in
efficiency
to
the
modes
of
conduct
which
would
have
secured
this
result
general
gielgud
was
an
entire
stranger
instead
of
freely
approaching
the
soldier
and
endeavoring
to
gain
his
attachment
he
treated
him
with
uniform
coldness
and
reserve
it
is
on
the
whole
a
matter
of
just
surprise
that
a
man
with
such
glaring
faults
of
character
should
have
been
appointed
to
so
responsible
a
trust
general
chlapowski
commenced
his
military
career
also
in
in
the
russian
war
he
advanced
to
the
rank
of
officer
and
was
made
camp
of
prince
poniatowski
while
in
this
situation
he
advanced
to
the
rank
of
a
staff
officer
in
which
rank
he
left
the
army
in
and
retired
to
his
estates
in
the
grand
duchy
of
pozen
where
he
married
the
sister
of
the
princess
of
lowicz
the
wife
of
the
grand
duke
constantine
the
entrance
of
this
general
into
the
revolutionary
ranks
excited
considerable
surprise
but
as
he
joined
himself
to
the
squadrons
of
pozen
which
were
formed
of
the
bravest
and
most
patriotic
materials
there
was
no
distrust
felt
of
him
his
successes
in
traversing
the
department
of
bialystok
entitled
him
to
the
highest
praise
it
was
this
fine
expedition
which
gained
him
the
confidence
of
the
lithuanian
corps
and
after
the
battle
of
wilno
they
were
unanimous
in
inviting
him
to
take
the
chief
command
the
nominal
command
as
we
have
related
he
declined
but
took
a
post
which
gave
him
the
superintendence
of
all
the
operations
while
he
was
thus
in
the
direction
of
affairs
the
greatest
faults
as
we
have
seen
were
committed
for
which
no
adequate
explanation
can
be
given
we
will
recapitulate
some
of
they
were
the
sending
of
the
sappers
to
build
the
bridge
over
the
niemen
the
attack
on
szawla
his
not
succoring
general
rohland
in
the
combat
of
powenduny
the
inexplicable
secrecy
which
he
kept
upon
his
intention
of
passing
the
prussian
frontier
having
left
kurszany
for
that
object
whilst
all
his
officers
were
given
to
understand
that
the
separation
of
the
corps
at
that
place
was
with
the
view
of
marching
to
act
in
the
environs
of
kowno
these
are
points
upon
which
this
officer
has
yet
to
answer
at
the
bar
of
his
country
chlapowski
was
a
more
dangerous
person
even
than
gielgud
for
gielgud
was
a
man
of
such
undisguised
arrogance
that
he
repelled
the
confidence
of
others
but
chlapowski
with
all
the
faults
of
gielgud
had
an
exterior
of
dissimulation
which
won
insensibly
upon
those
who
had
not
thoroughly
studied
his
character
but
none
who
had
observed
and
known
him
well
could
ever
yield
him
their
esteem

of
their
capture
of
the
documents
showing
the
influence
exercised
by
the
cabinets
in
discouraging
active
conclusion
the
corps
of
general
dembinski
had
been
more
fortunate
than
those
of
chlapowski
and
rohland
that
general
quitting
kurszany
on
the
of
july
returned
in
obedience
to
the
orders
which
we
have
detailed
by
means
of
the
forests
to
the
environs
of
szawla
leaving
the
enemy
upon
the
right
and
without
being
observed
by
him
he
having
advanced
with
his
whole
force
in
the
direction
of
worna
under
the
belief
that
our
undivided
forces
were
in
that
position
this
corps
traversed
the
country
between
szawla
and
rosseyny
and
arrived
during
the
night
of
the
at
janow
where
they
dispersed
a
squadron
of
the
cavalry
and
took
fifty
prisoners
and
passed
there
the
river
wiliia
without
interruption
from
thence
they
left
for
the
environs
of
kowno
where
not
far
from
rumszyski
on
the
they
met
a
brigade
of
russian
infantry
which
was
on
the
march
from
wilno
to
the
frontier
of
poland
general
dembinski
attacked
this
brigade
with
such
impetuosity
that
they
were
thrown
into
the
greatest
consternation
two
cannons
and
several
prisoners
were
taken
the
great
forests
by
which
the
russians
were
able
to
effect
their
escape
alone
saved
this
brigade
from
entire
destruction
having
thus
opened
their
road
they
took
the
direction
of
the
town
of
lida
passing
the
niemen
not
far
from
that
place
afterwards
they
threw
themselves
into
the
forests
of
bialystok
and
in
these
forests
the
corps
was
reinforced
by
a
considerable
number
of
lithuanian
insurgent
cavalry
which
had
been
acting
with
great
advantages
over
the
enemy
by
cutting
off
his
transports
of
ammunition
and
other
modes
of
harassing
him
during
the
whole
of
our
campaign
this
force
was
under
the
command
of
colonel
general
dembinski
quitted
the
forests
in
the
environs
of
orla
and
leaving
the
town
of
bielsk
on
his
right
passed
through
the
town
of
bocki
near
which
he
surprised
and
dispersed
a
regiment
of
cossacks
and
took
several
prisoners
and
among
them
a
number
of
officers
in
the
environs
of
siemiatycze
where
the
corps
arrived
on
the
of
june
they
were
arrested
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
large
body
of
troops
general
dembinski
halted
and
placed
his
forces
in
order
of
battle
sending
his
flankers
in
advance
on
the
other
side
the
same
movement
was
made
the
flanking
parties
of
the
opposite
forces
approached
each
other
but
what
was
the
astonishment
of
the
two
corps
at
seeing
the
tirailleurs
in
place
of
firing
upon
each
other
rushing
into
each
other
arms
and
rending
the
air
with
patriotic
exclamations
the
corps
which
was
thus
met
by
that
of
general
dembinski
was
the
corps
of
general
rozycki
which
had
been
sent
from
our
grand
army
to
reinforce
the
corps
of
general
gielgud
the
reader
will
now
call
to
mind
the
plan
of
operations
proposed
by
colonel
valentin
after
the
battle
of
wilno
and
the
arrival
of
this
reinforcement
at
the
very
spot
which
was
to
have
been
the
point
of
concentration
aggravates
the
regret
that
his
plans
were
not
adopted
nothing
could
exceed
the
satisfaction
of
the
two
corps
at
thus
meeting
general
rozycki
learning
the
disastrous
circumstances
which
had
occurred
changed
his
plan
of
operation
and
decided
to
unite
himself
with
the
corps
of
general
dembinski
and
to
return
with
it
to
the
grand
army
the
junction
of
these
two
corps
had
scarcely
taken
place
when
a
cloud
of
dust
in
the
direction
of
bielsk
announced
the
march
of
another
body
of
troops
a
small
reconnoissance
sent
in
that
direction
returned
with
the
intelligence
that
it
was
the
russian
corps
under
golowkin
our
generals
considering
all
circumstances
determined
not
to
engage
with
them
and
continued
their
march
towards
poland
passing
at
night
the
river
bug
they
then
took
the
direction
of
wengrow
and
kaluszyn
and
by
that
route
arrived
at
warsaw
toward
the
end
of
the
month
of
july
the
corps
of
general
dembinski
which
had
traversed
more
than
four
hundred
miles
in
about
twenty
days
from
its
departure
from
kurszany
in
the
midst
of
detachments
of
the
enemy
was
received
by
the
nation
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
the
president
of
the
senate
prince
adam
czartoriski
the
generalissimo
skrzynecki
with
all
the
officers
of
government
followed
by
an
immense
body
of
citizens
met
him
at
the
distance
of
a
half
league
from
the
city
and
he
was
greeted
with
an
address
expressive
of
the
thanks
of
the
nation
for
his
courageous
and
persevering
exertions
it
ended
in
the
following
terms
general
and
brethren
in
arms
you
will
be
a
living
reproach
to
those
who
forgetting
their
sacred
duties
have
by
their
misconduct
forced
their
countrymen
to
lay
down
their
arms
and
seek
the
protection
of
another
nation
to
commemorate
the
brave
exertions
of
this
corps
and
to
transmit
these
events
to
posterity
the
address
above
referred
to
was
ordered
to
be
enregistered
in
the
volumes
of
the
public
laws
a
printed
copy
was
also
given
to
each
soldier
of
the
corps
at
the
same
time
a
commission
was
appointed
to
inquire
into
the
conduct
of
generals
gielgud
and
chlapowski
when
we
consider
the
manner
in
which
the
russian
army
after
their
passage
of
the
vistula
passed
the
interval
between
the
of
july
the
day
of
their
arrival
at
lowicz
and
the
of
august
we
shall
be
at
a
loss
to
account
for
their
inaction
if
general
paszkewicz
was
in
a
condition
to
take
warsaw
he
could
gain
nothing
by
this
repose
nay
every
moment
of
delay
might
increase
the
difficulties
he
would
have
to
overcome
why
then
all
this
delay
what
could
have
prevented
us
from
reinforcing
our
ranks
strengthening
the
fortifications
of
warsaw
and
even
sending
another
corps
however
small
into
lithuania
to
support
a
new
insurrection
such
a
corps
could
have
easily
made
its
way
even
in
the
midst
of
the
russian
detached
corps
remaining
on
the
other
side
of
the
vistula
and
indeed
those
corps
so
imprudently
left
there
could
have
been
beaten
in
detail
by
our
forces
if
these
circumstances
are
well
considered
the
reader
will
be
satisfied
that
this
manoeuvre
of
passing
the
vistula
though
in
appearance
so
threatening
to
us
was
in
reality
a
most
imprudent
step
on
the
enemy
part
and
exposed
him
to
the
most
imminent
danger
many
detailed
considerations
might
be
given
upon
this
point
but
as
they
would
occupy
much
space
and
would
withdraw
us
too
far
from
the
purpose
of
this
narrative
we
must
leave
them
to
abler
pens
the
general
view
however
which
we
have
taken
of
the
position
of
the
enemy
will
be
enough
to
awaken
the
astonishment
of
the
reader
that
the
event
of
the
contest
should
have
arrived
so
suddenly
and
so
fatally
to
us
we
are
therefore
led
to
present
some
reflections
upon
what
seems
to
us
to
have
been
the
true
causes
of
the
disastrous
issue
of
the
struggle
we
may
in
the
first
place
be
permitted
to
remark
that
the
removal
of
our
army
from
warsaw
to
lowicz
to
meet
the
enemy
there
does
not
appear
to
have
been
a
fortunate
disposition
by
it
some
twenty
days
were
spent
in
indecisive
manoeuvres
against
a
superior
force
if
during
that
interval
in
place
of
marching
to
meet
the
enemy
the
army
had
been
concentrated
in
the
environs
of
warsaw
and
employed
in
constructing
fortifications
upon
the
great
roads
leading
to
warsaw
from
blonie
nadarzyn
piaseczno
and
kalwaryia
as
a
first
line
of
defence
and
in
strengthening
the
great
fortifications
of
warsaw
then
leaving
half
of
our
force
to
defend
these
fortifications
we
might
have
crossed
the
vistula
with
the
other
half
and
acted
upon
all
the
detached
corps
of
the
enemy
on
the
right
bank
and
have
besides
intercepted
all
the
reinforcements
for
the
main
army
of
paszkewicz
our
communications
also
with
the
provinces
being
thus
opened
and
their
territory
freed
from
the
presence
of
the
enemy
we
should
have
again
been
enabled
to
avail
ourselves
of
their
i
can
not
but
think
that
if
such
a
plan
of
operation
had
been
adopted
for
which
in
fact
there
was
ample
time
in
the
interval
above
named
an
altogether
different
turn
would
have
been
given
to
our
affairs
if
the
objection
should
be
made
that
the
delay
which
actually
occurred
could
not
have
been
reasonably
anticipated
and
that
paszkewicz
might
have
immediately
advanced
to
the
attack
of
warsaw
still
without
entering
for
the
present
into
more
detailed
considerations
in
support
of
my
opinion
it
will
be
enough
to
answer
that
if
hours
merely
were
to
be
had
those
hours
should
have
been
employed
in
fortification
rather
than
manoeuvring
for
it
was
not
at
lowicz
but
under
the
walls
of
warsaw
that
the
enemy
were
to
be
fought
as
it
was
at
warsaw
then
that
the
decisive
encounter
must
inevitably
have
taken
place
would
it
not
have
been
the
most
judicious
course
to
have
confined
our
operations
on
the
left
bank
of
the
vistula
to
the
strengthening
of
the
defences
of
warsaw
to
have
in
fact
adopted
in
regard
to
the
enemy
who
had
now
transferred
his
strength
to
the
left
bank
of
the
vistula
the
same
course
of
operations
which
we
had
hitherto
pursued
against
him
while
he
was
in
occupation
of
the
right
in
short
to
have
made
of
warsaw
another
praga
our
course
of
operations
should
in
fact
have
been
just
reversed
to
correspond
with
the
change
which
the
enemy
passage
of
the
vistula
had
made
in
our
relative
positions
while
he
was
on
the
right
bank
the
region
on
the
left
of
the
river
was
open
to
us
and
there
were
our
resources
but
now
that
he
was
acting
with
his
main
army
on
the
left
bank
it
should
have
been
our
aim
by
annihilating
his
detached
corps
to
have
opened
to
our
operations
the
whole
region
of
the
right
which
was
far
more
extensive
than
the
other
and
which
besides
had
the
advantage
to
us
of
being
contiguous
to
the
insurrectionary
provinces
in
case
of
an
attack
on
warsaw
which
of
course
could
not
be
an
affair
of
a
few
days
only
that
part
of
our
forces
operating
on
the
right
bank
could
be
withdrawn
in
ample
season
to
present
our
whole
strength
to
the
enemy
in
its
defence
since
i
have
allowed
myself
to
make
the
above
remarks
in
regard
to
the
plans
of
the
general
in
chief
i
must
also
be
permitted
to
add
that
at
that
period
of
inquietude
and
distrust
the
presence
of
the
commander
in
chief
and
of
the
president
of
the
national
government
at
warsaw
was
of
the
utmost
importance
that
presence
was
continually
needed
to
act
on
the
minds
of
the
people
to
preserve
union
and
tranquillity
and
to
discover
and
bring
to
exemplary
punishment
the
traitors
who
had
been
plotting
the
ruin
of
their
country
in
short
to
encourage
the
patriotic
and
to
alarm
the
treacherous
if
those
two
individuals
so
deservedly
beloved
and
honored
by
the
nation
had
been
present
we
doubt
whether
those
melancholy
scenes
at
warsaw
on
the
and
of
august
when
some
forty
persons
who
were
under
conviction
of
treason
perished
by
the
hands
of
the
people
would
ever
have
taken
place
revolting
as
those
scenes
were
we
must
yet
consider
whether
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
will
not
afford
some
palliation
for
them
deserted
by
those
who
had
been
the
objects
of
their
profoundest
attachment
and
confidence
haunted
by
the
recollections
of
the
terrible
disasters
which
had
been
incurred
and
which
they
could
attribute
to
nothing
short
of
treason
seeing
twenty
days
again
sacrificed
during
which
the
russian
corps
from
lithuania
were
permitted
to
pass
the
vistula
that
of
kreutz
at
plock
and
that
of
rudiger
at
pulawy
and
join
their
main
army
in
fine
seeing
this
immense
russian
force
approaching
the
capital
from
which
perhaps
they
were
expecting
a
repetition
of
all
the
atrocities
of
suwarow
remembering
the
thousands
of
victims
which
these
traitors
had
already
sacrificed
and
reflecting
on
the
thousands
whom
they
had
plotted
to
sacrifice
can
it
be
wondered
that
in
those
moments
of
despair
that
people
should
have
yielded
to
their
impulses
of
indignation
and
have
chosen
rather
to
sacrifice
at
once
those
convicted
traitors
than
permit
them
to
live
and
perhaps
be
the
instruments
of
the
vengeance
of
the
conqueror
abandoned
thus
by
those
who
should
have
been
near
to
tranquillize
them
the
people
took
that
justice
into
their
own
hands
which
the
government
had
neglected
to
execute
and
with
their
suspicions
operated
upon
by
this
accumulation
of
disasters
they
went
to
the
degree
of
demanding
the
removal
from
their
posts
of
prince
czartoriski
and
the
general
in
chief
such
are
i
think
the
true
explanations
of
those
acts
so
serious
in
their
consequences
and
which
have
created
so
much
surprise
the
removal
of
skrzynecki
from
the
chief
command
was
certainly
one
of
the
most
deplorable
results
of
this
disordered
state
of
the
minds
of
the
people
for
who
could
so
well
meet
the
exigencies
of
the
time
as
he
familiar
with
every
detail
engaged
in
the
midst
of
events
and
possessing
the
entire
confidence
of
the
army
it
was
in
this
period
of
distrust
and
suspicion
that
the
russian
army
which
seemed
to
have
been
waiting
only
for
such
a
moment
received
the
intelligence
from
some
traitors
yet
undiscovered
within
the
walls
of
warsaw
that
the
time
had
arrived
for
their
attack
it
was
undoubtedly
directed
by
such
intelligence
that
they
made
their
attack
on
warsaw
at
the
moment
when
the
greater
part
of
our
army
had
been
sent
by
its
new
commander
prondzynski
to
act
on
the
right
bank
of
the
vistula
against
the
corps
of
golowkin
which
was
menacing
praga
the
city
thus
defended
by
the
national
guard
and
a
small
part
of
the
army
alone
and
distracted
by
the
divisions
which
russian
intrigues
had
fomented
fell
after
a
bloody
defence
and
the
fate
of
poland
was
decided
we
have
stated
our
belief
that
the
fatal
events
which
hastened
the
catastrophe
might
have
been
prevented
by
the
mere
presence
at
the
capital
of
the
heads
of
the
army
and
the
national
government
at
those
trying
moments
which
brought
on
that
disordered
state
of
the
public
mind
of
this
error
we
can
not
readily
acquit
them
upright
and
patriotic
as
we
know
their
intentions
to
have
been
but
upon
the
other
point
that
mysterious
inaction
of
our
forces
for
so
considerable
a
period
there
is
an
important
light
thrown
in
the
following
extracts
from
the
correspondence
of
the
prince
czartoriski
with
the
french
minister
of
the
exterior
read
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
on
the
of
september
by
the
venerable
general
lafayette
and
in
the
extracts
from
his
remarks
and
those
of
general
lamarque
made
on
that
occasion
and
which
have
probably
before
met
the
eye
of
the
reader
extract
from
the
letter
of
prince
czartoriski
we
relied
upon
the
magnanimity
and
the
wisdom
of
the
cabinets
trusting
to
them
we
have
not
availed
ourselves
of
all
the
resources
which
were
at
our
command
both
exterior
and
interior
to
secure
the
approbation
of
the
cabinets
to
deserve
their
confidence
and
to
obtain
their
support
we
have
never
departed
from
the
strictest
moderation
by
which
moderation
indeed
we
have
paralyzed
many
of
the
efforts
which
might
have
saved
us
in
those
latter
days
but
for
the
promises
of
the
cabinets
should
have
been
able
to
strike
a
blow
which
perhaps
would
have
been
we
thought
that
it
was
necessary
to
temporize
to
leave
nothing
to
chance
and
we
have
at
last
seen
the
certainty
at
the
present
moment
that
there
is
nothing
but
chance
that
can
save
us
it
be
said
that
the
promises
here
referred
to
might
have
been
only
an
affair
of
the
gazettes
i
answer
that
i
have
demanded
explanations
of
the
polish
legation
and
here
is
the
reply
which
i
have
obtained
in
answer
to
the
letter
which
we
have
received
from
you
general
we
hasten
to
assure
you
that
it
was
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
who
engaged
us
on
the
of
july
to
send
a
messenger
to
warsaw
whose
travelling
expenses
were
advanced
by
the
minister
that
the
object
of
this
messenger
was
as
his
excellency
the
count
sebastiani
told
us
to
induce
our
government
to
wait
two
months
longer
for
that
was
the
time
necessary
for
the
negociations
that
the
circular
of
our
minister
of
foreign
affairs
dated
the
of
august
signed
by
the
minister
ad
interim
audne
horodyski
and
also
another
circular
of
the
of
the
same
month
signed
by
the
new
minister
of
foreign
affairs
theodore
morawski
came
to
our
hands
by
the
post
of
the
current
that
they
are
the
same
circulars
which
we
at
first
officially
communicated
to
the
count
sebastiani
on
the
of
september
and
which
we
immediately
after
addressed
to
the
journals
where
they
appeared
on
the
and
and
that
those
two
circulars
in
fact
explain
the
effect
which
the
mission
of
the
above
envoy
produced
at
warsaw
le
kniazewiecz
l
plater
the
november
can
it
be
true
that
this
heroic
nation
who
offered
her
bosom
to
the
lance
of
the
tartars
only
to
serve
as
a
buckler
for
us
is
to
fall
because
she
has
followed
the
counsels
which
france
and
england
have
given
her
thus
then
is
to
be
explained
the
inaction
of
her
army
at
the
moment
when
it
ought
to
have
taken
a
decisive
step
thus
is
to
be
explained
the
irresolution
of
the
generalissimo
who
from
the
first
moment
had
showed
so
much
audacity
and
skill
we
may
now
know
why
he
did
not
profit
by
the
passage
of
the
vistula
which
divided
the
army
of
the
enemy
to
give
him
battle
either
on
one
bank
or
the
other
the
minister
rejects
with
indignation
this
imputation
of
complicity
he
declares
formally
that
he
had
made
no
promise
that
he
had
given
no
hope
that
he
had
fixed
no
honorable
poles
whom
i
have
seen
this
morning
affirm
the
contrary
our
colleague
lafayette
will
give
you
details
almost
official
on
this
subject
session
of
the
september
will
ask
this
without
the
least
expectation
of
receiving
a
reply
but
only
to
render
a
just
homage
to
the
conduct
of
the
poles
and
of
their
government
i
will
ask
if
it
is
true
that
the
poles
were
urged
by
the
french
government
by
the
english
ministers
and
by
the
french
ambassador
at
london
to
use
moderation
and
not
to
risk
a
battle
because
the
measures
which
those
powers
were
to
take
in
behalf
of
poland
would
not
be
delayed
but
for
two
months
and
that
in
two
months
poland
would
enter
into
the
great
family
of
those
two
months
have
expired
and
i
state
this
here
to
render
justice
to
the
conduct
of
the
polish
government
the
polish
army
and
its
chief
who
may
have
thought
that
on
his
giving
a
general
battle
to
prevent
the
passage
of
the
vistula
they
could
thwart
the
good
intentions
of
the
french
and
english
government
in
this
respect
i
think
that
this
will
be
considered
a
fair
procedure
towards
messieurs
the
ministers
to
whom
the
questions
shall
be
addressed
on
monday
to
apprize
them
that
this
is
one
of
those
which
will
be
then
submitted
to
them
these
documents
will
be
for
the
present
age
and
for
posterity
an
explanation
of
the
true
causes
of
the
ruin
of
poland
she
fell
not
by
the
enormous
forces
of
her
enemy
but
by
his
perfidious
intrigues
we
can
not
accuse
france
or
england
and
indeed
no
pole
does
accuse
them
for
although
we
may
have
some
enemies
in
those
countries
yet
we
can
not
conceive
of
the
existence
of
any
causes
of
hostility
towards
us
by
which
those
nations
can
be
actuated
they
were
blinded
by
the
promises
of
russia
by
the
solemn
assurances
which
she
gave
that
she
would
soon
arrange
every
thing
in
the
most
favorable
manner
for
poland
in
this
web
of
intrigue
were
those
cabinets
entangled
who
would
else
have
followed
the
common
dictates
of
humanity
in
succoring
poland
while
she
was
thus
deceiving
the
cabinets
russia
was
doing
her
utmost
to
sow
distrust
and
disunion
among
our
people
it
was
her
intrigues
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
traitors
whom
she
had
gained
for
her
accomplices
that
caused
the
estrangement
of
the
nation
from
skrzynecki
who
having
a
true
polish
heart
had
repelled
all
her
vile
attempts
to
shake
his
integrity
and
who
by
his
talent
and
energy
had
so
often
defeated
and
might
still
defeat
the
enormous
masses
which
she
had
sent
against
us
those
intrigues
succeeded
and
russia
gained
her
end
in
overwhelming
poland
with
misery
not
reflecting
that
by
so
doing
she
was
bringing
misfortunes
upon
her
own
head
russia
by
a
liberal
concession
to
poland
of
her
national
rights
could
have
been
truly
great
not
to
speak
of
the
influence
of
the
polish
institutions
upon
the
happiness
of
her
own
people
her
true
stability
and
strength
could
in
no
way
be
so
well
secured
as
by
the
independent
existence
of
poland
they
who
have
labored
for
our
destruction
were
not
then
true
russians
they
were
the
enemies
of
their
country
and
of
humanity
heartless
calculators
acting
with
a
single
view

their
own
personal
aggrandizement

equally

enemies

if
notwithstanding
the
many
good
works
recently
published
upon
poland
the
history
of
that
country
is
still
but
imperfectly
known
to
the
rest
of
the
world
it
may
be
said
that
the
history
of
lithuania
is
almost
absolutely
unknown
to
the
people
of
the
west
it
is
generally
thought
that
it
has
always
composed
an
integral
part
of
the
russian
empire
and
that
it
was
only
occasionally
that
it
has
held
relations
with
ancient
poland
a
false
impression
and
one
which
the
public
journals
have
but
too
frequently
assisted
in
propagating
the
truth
is
that
for
five
hundred
years
lithuania
has
voluntarily
associated
herself
with
the
destinies
of
ancient
poland
and
it
is
only
with
shame
and
reluctance
that
she
has
borne
the
russian
yoke
but
that
which
is
of
great
importance
at
present
to
consider
is
the
ancient
sympathy
which
has
constantly
united
the
two
people
there
is
a
common
spirit
of
nationality
which
notwithstanding
the
studiously
contrived
disintegration
of
their
territory
has
always
animated
the
lithuanians
and
the
poles
a
most
important
fact
for
it
is
on
this
fraternity
of
feeling
and
community
of
opinion
between
the
ancient
polish
provinces
that
the
salvation
of
modern
poland
essentially
depends
we
will
endeavor
by
presenting
to
the
reader
the
following
extracts
from
the
work
of
leonard
chodzko
to
throw
some
light
upon
the
political
history
of
this
interesting
portion
of
the
slavian
race
a
long
time
a
distinct
power
and
governed
by
its
grand
dukes
united
for
the
first
time
with
poland
in
the
year
and
making
in
an
integral
part
of
the
republic
of

lithuania
from
that
epoch
to
that
of
formed
in
the
political
state
the

composed
of

of

cavalier
at
full
speed
with

raised
over

this
cavalier
of
lithuania
joined
with
the
white
eagle
of
poland
figured
inseparably
upon
the
arms
of
the
republic
upon
the
national
standards
the
public
edifices
and
the
coins
up
to
the
moment
when
foreign
force
and
domestic
treason
struck
a
liberticide
blow
at
that
union
which
ages
has
consecrated
in
for
a
moment
those
fraternal
arms
were
united
but
separated
again
they
once
more
floated
upon
every
banner
after
the
memorable
date
of
the
of
november
according
to
ancient
traditions
towards
the
year
there
landed
on
the
coast
of
samogitia
between
memel
polonga
and
libau
a
colony
of
italians
who
introduced
into
that
country
a
certain
degree
of
civilization
and
from
thence
came
that
multitude
of
latin
words
which
are
to
be
remarked
in
the
lithuanian
language
from
these
italian
families
arose
several
sovereign
dynasties
which
governed
lithuania
and
samogitia
of
this
origin
were
without
doubt
the
gerules
or
herules
who
formerly
governed
lithuania
this
people
is
the
same
which
in
the
fifth
century
invaded
italy
with
odacre
and
returning
on
their
steps
spread
themselves
upon
the
shores
of
the
baltic
which
embrace
at
the
present
day
oriental
prussia
lithuania
samogitia
and
courland
lithuanians
though
subjugated
first
by
the
russians
did
not
fail
to
make
their
strength
soon
felt
by
their
invaders
in
the
century
when
the
tartars
ravaged
on
one
side
the
russian
states
the
lithuanians
on
the
other
side
took
possession
of
grodno
brzesc
and
drohyczyn
and
did
not
stop
till
they
reached
the
banks
of
the
prypec
and
the
town
of
mozyr
in
the
north
their
victorious
arms
were
pushed
as
far
as
the
dwina
and
the
city
of
polock
in
the
year
the
russians
under
declared
war
upon
lithuania
but
they
were
beaten
near
the
river
tasiolda
and
the
lithuanians
augmented
their
possessions
by
the
occupation
of
pinsk

turow

the
first
who
took
the
title
of

over
this

but
the
greatest
power
of

dates
from
the
fourteenth

to
crush
the
russian
power

distressed

gédymin
perished
upon
the
field
of
battle
by
the

to

were
in

province

the

pitched
battle

extended
the
territory
of

as
far
as
the
banks
of

the
black
sea
to
form
an
idea
of
the
extent
of
the
lithuanian

to
point
out

where
instead

he
gave
them

muscovite
power
subjugating

this
however
could
have
no
effect
upon

daily
acquired
new
strength

subsequently
to

first
union
of

that
when
the

the

should
elect
their

alliance
concluded

renewed

was
added
explicitly
that
the
lithuanians
should
not
elect
their
grand
duke
without
the
concurrence
of
the
poles
nor
the
poles
their
king
without
that
of
the
lithuanians
in
the
knights
militant
submitted
themselves
and
the
part
of
livonia
which
remained
with
them
to
the
domination
of
the
king
of
poland
as
grand
duke
of
lithuania
the
new
duke
of
courland
became
also
his
feudatory
in
fine
in
under
the
poles
and
lithuanians
held
a
diet
at
lublin
in
which
the
grand
duchy
was
limited
to
the
kingdom
of
poland
so
that
they
thereafter
formed
but
one
body
subject
to
one
prince
who
was
conjointly
elected
by
the
two
nations
under
the
double
title
of
king
of
poland
and
grand
duke
of
lithuania
it
was
agreed
also
that
the
diet
should
be
always
held
at
warsaw
that
the
two
people
should
have
the
same
senate
the
same
chamber
of
deputies
that
their
coins
should
be
of
the
same
designation
that
in
fine
their
alliances
their
auxiliary
troops
and
every
thing
should
be
in
common
the
campaigns
of
moskow
under
sigismond
iii
wladislaz
iv
and
etienne
batory
amply
proved
that
the
lithuanians
were
worthy
of
calling
the
poles
brethren
for
they
were
found
ready
for
every
sacrifice
when
the
general
good
of
the
country
was
in
question
in
the
laws
of
and
it
was
ruled
that
each
third
diet
should
be
held
in
lithuania
at
grodno
the
diets
of
convocation
and
of
election
and
coronation
were
excepted
however
from
this
rule
in
the
polish
and
lithuanian
laws
received
an
equal
force
and
authority
the
epoch
of
the
regeneration
of
poland
the
lithuanians
gave
the
most
convincing
proofs
of
their
devotedness
to
the
polish
cause
in
the
last
years
of
the
existence
of
poland
in
effect
when
they
became
satisfied
that
for
the
common
interest
and
to
give
more
consistency
to
the
new
form
of
government
which
it
was
proposed
to
establish
at
the
diet
of
it
was
necessary
to
strengthen
still
more
the
relations
between
lithuania
and
the
crown
that
is
to
say
between
little
and
great
poland
so
as
to
form
out
of
the
three
provinces
a
single
powerful
state
and
to
obliterate
totally
all
the
distinctions
which
had
before
existed
between
the
poles
and
the
lithuanians
they
made
a
voluntary
sacrifice
of
the
privileges
which
they
had
held
with
great
pertinacity
and
renounced
without
hesitation
that
of
having
a
separate
army
and
treasury
consenting
to
unite
themselves
under
a
single
administration
with
the
two
other
provinces
whole
world
was
witness
to
the
heroism
which
the
lithuanians
displayed
in
the
glorious
confederation
of
bar
from
to
in
the
campaigns
of
and
against
foreign
rapacity
when
kosciuszko
a
lithuanian
by
birth
covered
with
imperishable
laurels
the
chains
of
poland
the
lithuanians
fell
but
they
fell
with
the
whole
of
poland
and
were
buried
in
the
common
ruin
how
nobly
have
not
the
lithuanians
been
seen
to
figure
among
the
brave
polish
patriots
who
sought
in
france
in
italy
and
in
turkey
some
chances
of
restoration
for
a
country
which
had
been
the
victim
of
foreign
ambition
and
how
many
of
them
have
not
been
found
under
the
banners
of
dombrowski
in
italy
and
under
those
of
kniaziewiez
upon
the
danube

we
not
seen

the
years

hastening
to

themselves
under
the
banners
of
the

in
their
joy
was
extreme
when
they
thought
that
their
political
existence
was
at
last
about
to
be
renewed

was
seen
the
cavalier
of
lithuania
united
with
the
white
eagle
decorating
the
flags
planted
on
the
walls
of
wilno
but
the
disastrous
retreat
of
the
french
army
struck
a
mortal
blow
to
the
destinies
of
those
countries

proclaimed
in
the
diets
of
warsaw

preserved
silence
respecting
the
lot
of
the
grand

we
will
henceforth
proceed

to
accomplish
the
difficult
perilous
but
just
and
sacred
work
the
restoration
of
our
country
the
manifesto
of
the
diet
in
explaining
the
cause
of
our
rising
gave
an
account
of
our
sentiments
as
well
as
yours
scarcely
had
we
risen
in
arms
provided
with
but
few
means
and
uncertain
what
course
to
pursue
before
we
showed
to
the
world
and
to
the
emperor
nicholas
that
the
same
spirit
animated
us
and
that
we
were
desirous
to
become
as
we
had
formerly
been
but
one
and
the
same
nation
the
emperor
nicholas
did
not
wish
to
consecrate
the
tomb
of
his
brother
by
a
monument
which
during
the
life
time
of
alexander
would
have
sealed
the
glory
of
his
reign
he
did
not
wish
to
regard
us
as
poles
bowed
down
with
injuries
as
citizens
of
a
free
and
independent
country
and
would
treat
with
us
only
as
slaves
who
had
rebelled
against
russia
we
have
arrested
we
have
driven
back
the
threatening
phalanxes
of
his
different
corps
of
the
forces
of
which
our
army
was
composed
some
fought
here
against
the
main
body
of
the
enemy
others
penetrated
into
your
provinces
to
call
forth
our
brethren
to
range
themselves
under
the
national
banner
you
did
not
wait
for
this
appeal
at
the
very
commencement
of
the
insurrection
many
of
your
citizens
explained
their
sentiments
and
their
wishes
in
the
national
assembly
and
some
raised
regiments
dignified
by
the
names
of
your
provinces
in
fine
whole
districts
of
lithuania
and
volhynia
rose
the
partition
of
poland
has
been
denominated
a
crime
by
the
unanimous
voice
of
europe
and
who
at
this
day
will
revoke
such
a
decision
who
will
venture
to
come
forward
as
the
champion
against
it
undoubtedly
none
and
we
have
the
hope
that
europe
will
hasten
to
recognize
our
independence
as
soon
as
we
have
proved
by
our
courage
our
perseverance
our
union
our
moderate
and
noble
conduct
that
we
deserve
to
be
a
free
nation
this
revolution
is
only
a
consequence
of
our
oppression
and
our
misfortunes
it
was
the
wish
of
our
hearts
and
arises
from
the
nature
of
our
history
which
displays
our
determination
from
the
very
beginning
and
proves
that
our
rising
was
not
of
foreign
prompting
it
is
not
civil
war
it
is
not
tainted
with
the
blood
of
our
brethren
we
have
not
overturned
social
institutions
in
order
to
raise
up
new
ones
at
hazard
it
is
a
war
of
independence
the
most
just
of
wars
this
is
the
character
of
our
revolution
which
is
at
once
mild
but
firm
which
with
one
arm
conquers
the
enemy
and
with
the
other
raises
and
ennobles
the
needy
peasant
we
admire
england
and
france
we
wish
to
be
like
them
a
civilized
nation
but
without
ceasing
to
be
poles
nations
can
not
and
ought
not
to
change
the
elements
of
their
existence
each
has
its
climate
industry
religion
manners
character
education
and
history
from
these
different
elements
spring
the
feelings
or
passions
which
display
themselves
in
revolutions
and
the
circumstances
proper
to
be
adopted
in
their
future
conduct
individuality
strongly
expressed
forms
the
power
of
a
people
we
have
preserved
ours
in
the
midst
of
slavery
love
of
country
prepared
to
make
every
sacrifice
courage
piety
and
gentleness
formed
the
character
of
our
forefathers
these
qualities
also
are
ours
the
patriots
of
warsaw
triumphed
without
chiefs
and
without
law
yet
with
what
crime
can
they
be
charged
an
army
of
men
and
in
short
the
whole
kingdom
rose
as
if
by
enchantment
and
how
did
they
conduct
themselves
towards
the
grand
duke
constantine
that
prince
who
for
fifteen
years
had
shown
himself
destitute
of
regard
or
pity
for
our
feelings
and
liberties
was
in
our
power
but
he
knew
the
nation
and
just
to
it
for
once
only
he
intrusted
his
person
and
his
army
to
our
honor
at
the
moment
of
alarm
we
did
not
listen
to
the
voice
of
public
vengeance
but
respected
the
prince
and
his
troops
without
taking
advantage
of
our
superiority
our
battalions
who
had
awaited
with
a
firm
determination
all
the
forces
of
russia
allowed
to
pass
through
their
ranks
the
fallen
enemy
whose
safety
was
guaranteed
by
the
national
honor
the
generosity
of
the
nation
has
been
proved
by
many
isolated
facts
and
europe
admires
our
moderation
as
much
as
our
valor
brethren
equal
admiration
still
awaits
us
without
delay
then
come
forward
with
the
whole
of
your
force
simultaneously
and
act
as
one
man
in
peace
and
in
war
it
is
the
people
who
are
the
source
of
all
power
to
the
people
then
direct
your
views
and
your
affections
children
worthy
of
your
fathers
you
will
act
like
them
you
will
break
the
odious
bonds
and
you
will
cement
a
holy
alliance
by
reciprocal
benefits
and
by
gratitude
in
other
countries
it
is
by
force
and
force
alone
that
the
people
recover
their
liberties
here
those
liberties
are
received
as
the
gift
of
their
brethren
a
generous
just
and
necessary
deed
will
become
the
act
only
of
your
own
choice
and
you
will
proclaim
to
the
people
their
independence
and
the
return
of
the
polish
eagles
to
their
native
soil
our
fields
will
lose
nothing
in
cultivation
and
value
when
they
are
tilled
by
the
industry
of
brave
men
you
will
be
ennobled
in
the
eyes
of
civilized
europe
and
your
country
will
gain
millions
of
who
like
our
brave
peasants
will
fly
to
the
defence
of
their
liberty
and
drive
back
a
power
whose
character
is
that
only
of
slavery
do
not
forget
brethren
and
fellow
citizens
that
the
greek
religion
is
professed
by
a
great
part
of
the
people
toleration
is
one
of
the
qualities
of
civilization
the
clergy
the
churches
and
religion
shall
be
placed
under
the
protection
of
the
government
and
will
lend
you
their
assistance
in
carrying
this
measure
of
justice
into
effect
the
address
goes
on
to
enlarge
upon
the
respect
paid
by
polish
noblemen
to
religious
rites
and
feelings
and
calls
on
the
people
on
this
occasion
to
follow
their
example
also
to
send
deputies
from
the
different
provinces
to
the
national
congress
it
then
goes
on
to
describe
the
vast
power
of
russia
and
the
difficulties
to
be
encountered
much
in
the
same
manner
as
the
proclamation
of
skrzynecki
and
concludes
thus
god
hath
already
wrought
prodigies
for
us
god
and
not
the
emperor
of
russia
will
be
our
judge
he
will
decide
he
will
decide
who
hath
committed
perjury
who
has
been
the
victim
of
oppression
and
who
ought
to
obtain
the
victory
we
have
already
fought
with
success
in
the
name
of
the
god
of
our
fathers
and
we
will
fight
till
at
length
we
have
accomplished
the
ends
of
justice
all
the
nations

of
the

when
we
shall
have
finished
this
terrible
and
unequal
contest
we
will
invite
the
powers

to
form
themselves
into

will

the
satisfaction

one
among

arrival
of
this

at

was
celebrated
with
great
solemnity
an
idea
of
it

be
formed
from
the
recital
which
is
given
in
the
de
since
the
triumphal
passage
of

veteran
of

lyons
has
seen
nothing
so
magnificent
as
the
great
movement
of

the

was
the
signal
from
eighty
to
a
hundred
thousand
souls
marched
before
the

upon

from
far
beyond
the
faubourgs
having
reached
the
entrance
of
the
city
escorted
by
the
elite
of
its
inhabitants
the
poles
found
themselves
in
the
midst
of
an
immense
crowd
who
made
the
air
ring
with
their
cries
of
enthusiasm
and
sympathy
from
thence
to

experienced
extreme
difficulty

with

a
universal
enthusiasm
the
french
embraced
their
noble
guests
and
it
was
a
touching
spectacle
this
assembly
electrified
by
the
most
pure
emotions
of
the
soul
and
in
which
tears
flowed
from
every
eye
it
was
affecting
to
see
the
physiognomies
of
the
brave
poles
during
this
solemnity
many
of
them
understood
the
french
language
and
tears
flowed
down
their
cheeks
at
each
of
the
allusions
which
the
orators
made
to
their
absent
country
their
crushed
revolution
the
young
heroine
seated
by
the
side
of
the
president
and
who
excited
a
profound
and
general
interest
could
hardly
suppress
the
sobs
which
oppressed
her
the
most
perfect
order
reigned
through
the
whole
fete
not
a
gendarme
was
present
and
no
excess
of
the
slightest
kind
occurred
this
countless
multitude
was
calm
notwithstanding
the
violence

the

proved
how
little

understand

no
iv
the
following
extract
from
the
london
courier
of
april
in
reference
to
the
recent
imperial
manifesto
which
converts
poland
into
a
province
of
russia
may
serve
to
confirm
the
remarks
which
we
have
made
in
the
text
on
the
system
of
deception
practised
by
the
emperor
nicholas
towards
the
cabinets
both
of
england
and
france
on
the
subject
of
poland
perceive
that
the
manifesto
of
the
emperor
of
russia
relative
to
poland
which
we
gave
on
saturday
has
excited
general
indignation
in
france
as
well
as
in
this
country
perhaps
as
the
poles
are
not
of
a
character
to
be
awed
into
submission
by
the
power
of
their
oppressors
whilst
the
slightest
chance
of
emancipation
is
open
to
them
it
is
better
for
the
cause
of
humanity
that
they
should
be
tied
hand
and
foot
in
the
bonds
of
slavery
than
that
any
opportunity
should
be
afforded
them
of
again
saturating
the
soil
of
poland
with
the
blood
of
its
best
and
bravest
patriots
if
life
with
disgrace
be
better
than
death
without
dishonor
the
destruction
of
the
nationality
of
poland
may
not
be
so
great
an
evil
as
the
world
at
large
imagine
if
the
utter
impossibility
of
successful
revolt
be
clearly
shown
the
poles
may
at
length
wear
their
fetters
without
resorting
to
vain
attempts
to
shake
them
off
and
the
monarch
who
has
enslaved
them
may
gradually
witness
the
extinction
of
mind
in
proportion
as
he
coerces
and
binds
the
body
but
what
a
sad
disgrace
it
is
upon
the
government
and
people
of
this
country
to
have
neglected
in
proper
season
the
means
of
securing
to
the
brave
and
unfortunate
people
of
poland
a
nationality
which
would
have
given
to
them
the
form
and
substance
of
liberty
without
involving
the
necessity
of
a
rupture
with
the
power
which
has
conquered
them
is
it
not
true
that
at
a
time
when
the
and
generous
portion
of
the
people
of
this
country
were
calling
upon
the
government
to
exercise
the
influence
and
power
of
the
british
crown
on
behalf
of
the
poles
the
reply
was
can
not
go
to
war
with
the
emperor
of
russia
for
foreign
interests
we
can
not
insist
upon
his
evacuating
poland
and
leaving
the
country
in
a
state
of
complete
independence
but
we
will
use
our
good
offices
towards
obtaining
favorable
terms
for
the
insurgents
and
we
have
already
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
the
emperor
nicholas
has
declared
that
the
nationality
of
poland
shall
in
no
case
be
forfeited
and
that
in
all
other
respects
the
world
shall
be
astonished
at
the
extent
of
his
generosity
towards
the
vanquished
there
a
member
of
the
government
or
any
other
person
who
will
tell
us
that
such
language
as
this
was
not
made
publicly
and
privately
in
parliament
and
out
of
parliament
in
the
newspapers
and
out
of
the
newspapers
and
that
the
sole
excuse
for
was
not
the
real
or
pretended
belief
that
the
nationality
of
poland
would
be
respected
and
the
conduct
of
the
emperor
nicholas
be
full
of
generosity
and
magnanimity
gracious
god
and
are
we
come
to
such
a
pass
that
the
sovereign
of
a
country
can
laugh
at
the
honor
and
dignity
of
the
british
name
is
all
the
respect
that
he
can
show
to
the
good
offices
of
the
british
government
in
behalf
of
a
people
to
be
found
in
empty
professions
and
unmeaning
declarations
and
are
we
to
put
up
tamely
with
one
of
the
greatest
insults
that
ever
was
inflicted
upon
the
government
of
the
country
was
it
for
this
that
we
conciliated
the
autocrat
of
the
north
on
the
belgian
question
and
is
all
the
return
of
our
concessions
a
bold
and
naked
defiance
of
our
power
and
a
determination
to
convince
the
world
that
the
days
of
british
influence
are
passed
forever
perhaps
we
shall
be
told
even
now
of
the
magnanimous
intentions
of
the
emperor
of
russia
but
the
cheat
is
too
stale
every
body
knows
not
only
that
we
have
truckled
to
russia
in
vain
but
that
to
deception
she
has
added
insult
and
that
at
this
moment
there
is
a
russian
ambassador
in
town
with
instructions
to
cajole
the
government
on
the
belgian
question
and
to
withhold
the
ratification
of
the
treaty
until
after
the
passing
or
rejecting
of
the
reform
bill
when
the
emperor
may
be
enabled
by
a
change
of
government
to
dispense
with
it
but
we
are
tired
of
the
subject
the
more
we
look
at
it
the
more
we
feel
disgraced
we
blame
not
this
or
that
minister
for
the
intentions
of
the
government
towards
poland
we
firmly
believe
were
kind
in
the
extreme
but
we
blush
for
the
country
at
large
in
having
purchased
the
chance
of
peace
at
the
sacrifice
of
honor
no
the
following
is
the
imperial
manifesto
referred
to
in
the
preceding
article
as
it
appears
in
the
berlin
state
gazette
under
the
head
of
warsaw
march
the
grace
of
god
nicholas
i
emperor
of
russia
king
of
poland
etc
when
by
our
manifesto
of
last
year
we
announced
to
our
faithful
subjects
the
march
of
our
troops
into
the
kingdom
of
poland
which
was
momentarily
snatched
from
the
lawful
authority
we
at
the
same
time
informed
them
of
our
intention
to
fix
the
future
fate
of
this
country
on
a
durable
basis
suited
to
its
wants
and
calculated
to
promote
the
welfare
of
our
whole
empire
now
that
an
end
has
been
put
by
force
of
arms
to
the
rebellion
in
poland
and
that
the
nation
led
away
by
agitators
has
returned
to
its
duty
and
is
restored
to
tranquillity
we
deem
it
right
to
carry
into
execution
our
plan
with
regard
to
the
introduction
of
the
new
order
of
things
whereby
the
tranquillity
and
union
of
the
two
nations
which
providence
has
entrusted
to
our
care
may
be
forever
guarded
against
new
attempts
poland
conquered
in
the
year
by
the
victorious
arms
of
russia
obtained
by
the
magnanimity
of
our
illustrious
predecessor
the
emperor
alexander
not
only
its
national
existence
but
also
special
laws
sanctioned
by
a
constitutional
charter
these
favors
however
would
not
satisfy
the
eternal
enemies
of
order
and
lawful
power
obstinately
persevering
in
their
culpable
projects
they
ceased
not
one
moment
to
dream
of
a
separation
between
the
two
nations
subject
to
our
sceptre
and
in
their
presumption
they
dared
to
abuse
the
favors
of
the
restorer
of
their
country
by
employing
for
the
destruction
of
his
noble
work
the
very
laws
and
liberties
which
his
mighty
arm
had
generously
granted
them
bloodshed
was
the
consequence
of
this
crime
the
tranquillity
and
happiness
which
the
kingdom
of
poland
had
enjoyed
to
a
degree
till
then
unknown
vanished
in
the
midst
of
civil
war
and
a
general
devastation
all
these
evils
are
now
passed
the
kingdom
of
poland
again
subject
to
our
sceptre
will
regain
tranquillity
and
again
flourish
in
the
bosom
of
peace
restored
to
it
under
the
auspices
of
a
vigilant
government
hence
we
consider
it
one
of
our
most
sacred
duties
to
watch
with
paternal
care
over
the
welfare
of
our
faithful
subjects
and
to
use
every
means
in
our
power
to
prevent
the
recurrence
of
similar
catastrophes
by
taking
from
the
the
power
of
disturbing
public
tranquillity
as
it
is
moreover
our
wish
to
secure
to
the
inhabitants
of
poland
the
continuance
of
all
the
essential
requisites
for
the
happiness
of
individuals
and
of
the
country
in
general
namely
security
of
persons
and
property
liberty
of
conscience
and
all
the
laws
and
privileges
of
towns
and
communes
so
that
the
kingdom
of
poland
with
a
separate
administration
adapted
to
its
wants
may
not
cease
to
form
an
integral
part
of
our
empire
and
that
the
inhabitants
of
this
country
may
henceforward
constitute
a
nation
united
with
the
russians
by
sympathy
and
fraternal
sentiments
we
have
according
to
these
principles
ordained
and
resolved
this
day
by
a
new
organic
statute
to
introduce
a
new
