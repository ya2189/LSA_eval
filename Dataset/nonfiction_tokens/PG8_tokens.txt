lincoln
second
inaugural
address
march
fellow
countrymen
at
this
second
appearing
to
take
the
oath
of
the
presidential
office
there
is
less
occasion
for
an
extended
address
than
there
was
at
the
first
then
a
statement
somewhat
in
detail
of
a
course
to
be
pursued
seemed
fitting
and
proper
now
at
the
expiration
of
four
years
during
which
public
declarations
have
been
constantly
called
forth
on
every
point
and
phase
of
the
great
contest
which
still
absorbs
the
attention
and
engrosses
the
energies
of
the
nation
little
that
is
new
could
be
presented
the
progress
of
our
arms
upon
which
all
else
chiefly
depends
is
as
well
known
to
the
public
as
to
myself
and
it
is
i
trust
reasonably
satisfactory
and
encouraging
to
all
with
high
hope
for
the
future
no
prediction
in
regard
to
it
is
ventured
on
the
occasion
corresponding
to
this
four
years
ago
all
thoughts
were
anxiously
directed
to
an
impending
civil
war
all
dreaded
it
all
sought
to
avert
it
while
the
inaugural
address
was
being
delivered
from
this
place
devoted
altogether
to
saving
the
union
without
war
insurgent
agents
were
in
the
city
seeking
to
destroy
it
without
war
seeking
to
dissolve
the
union
and
divide
effects
by
negotiation
both
parties
deprecated
war
but
one
of
them
would
make
war
rather
than
let
the
nation
survive
and
the
other
would
accept
war
rather
than
let
it
perish
and
the
war
came
of
the
whole
population
were
colored
slaves
not
distributed
generally
over
the
union
but
localized
in
the
southern
part
of
it
these
slaves
constituted
a
peculiar
and
powerful
interest
all
knew
that
this
interest
was
somehow
the
cause
of
the
war
to
strengthen
perpetuate
and
extend
this
interest
was
the
object
for
which
the
insurgents
would
rend
the
union
even
by
war
while
the
government
claimed
no
right
to
do
more
than
to
restrict
the
territorial
enlargement
of
it
neither
party
expected
for
the
war
the
magnitude
or
the
duration
which
it
has
already
attained
neither
anticipated
that
the
cause
of
the
conflict
might
cease
with
or
even
before
the
conflict
itself
should
cease
each
looked
for
an
easier
triumph
and
a
result
less
fundamental
and
astounding
both
read
the
same
bible
and
pray
to
the
same
god
and
each
invokes
his
aid
against
the
other
it
may
seem
strange
that
any
men
should
dare
to
ask
a
just
assistance
in
wringing
their
bread
from
the
sweat
of
other
men
faces
but
let
us
judge
not
that
we
be
not
judged
the
prayers
of
both
could
not
be
answered
that
of
neither
has
been
answered
fully
the
almighty
has
his
own
purposes
woe
unto
the
world
because
of
offenses
for
it
must
needs
be
that
offenses
come
but
woe
to
that
man
by
whom
the
offense
cometh
if
we
shall
suppose
that
american
slavery
is
one
of
those
offenses
which
in
the
providence
of
god
must
needs
come
but
which
having
continued
through
his
appointed
time
he
now
wills
to
remove
and
that
he
gives
to
both
north
and
south
this
terrible
war
as
the
woe
due
to
those
by
whom
the
offense
came
shall
we
discern
therein
any
departure
from
those
divine
attributes
which
the
believers
in
a
living
god
always
ascribe
to
him
fondly
do
we
hope
fervently
do
we
pray
that
this
mighty
scourge
of
war
may
speedily
pass
away
yet
if
god
wills
that
it
continue
until
all
the
wealth
piled
by
the
bondsman
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
of
unrequited
toil
shall
be
sunk
and
until
every
drop
of
blood
drawn
by
the
lash
shall
be
paid
by
another
drawn
with
the
sword
as
was
said
three
thousand
years
ago
so
still
it
must
be
said
the
judgments
of
the
lord
are
true
and
righteous
altogether
with
malice
toward
none
with
charity
for
all
with
firmness
in
the
right
as
god
gives
us
to
see
the
right
let
us
strive
on
to
finish
the
work
we
are
in
to
bind
up
the
nation
wounds
to
care
for
him
who
shall
have
borne
the
battle
and
for
his
widow
and
his
orphan
to
do
all
which
may
achieve
and
cherish
a
just
and
lasting
peace
among
ourselves
and
with
all
nations
