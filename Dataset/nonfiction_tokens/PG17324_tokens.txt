macedonia
and
the
empires
of
the
west
were
only
waiting
their
opportunity
to
lay
hold
of
it
by
its
position
it
formed
a
kind
of
where
most
of
the
military
nations
of
the
ancient
world
were
bound
sooner
or
later
to
come
violently
into
collision
confined
between
the

desert
syria
offers
the
only
route
of
easy
access
to

army
marching
northwards

pass
through
it

to
reach
the
object
of
their
cupidity
it
might
perhaps
have
escaped
this
fatal
consequence
of
its
position
had
the
formation
of
the
country
permitted
its
tribes
to
mass
themselves
together
and
oppose
a
compact
body
to
the
invading
hosts
but
the
range
of
mountains
which
forms
its
backbone
subdivides
it
into
isolated
districts
and
by
thus
restricting
each
tribe
to
a
narrow
existence
maintained
among
them

mutual
antagonism

and
the
which
divide

down

as
a

of

these

are
not
yet
determined
with
the
accuracy
desirable
the
egyptians
knew
it
in
early
times
by
the
name
of
aûnrati
or
araûnti
it
is
mentioned
in
assyrian
inscriptions
under
the
name
of
arantû
all
are
agreed
in
acknowledging
that
this
name
is
not
semitic
and
an
aryan
origin
is
attributed
to
it
but
without
convincing
proof
according
to
strabo
xvi
ii
it
was
originally
called
typhon
and
was
only
styled
orontes
after
a
certain
orontes
had
built
the
first
bridge
across
it
the
name
of
axios
which
it
sometimes
bears
appears
to
have
been
given
to
it
by
greek
colonists
in
memory
of
a
river
in
macedonia
this
is
probably
the
origin
of
the
modern
name
of
asi
and
the
meaning
which
arab
tradition
attaches
to
the
latter
term
probably
comes
from
a
popular
etymology
which
likened
axios
to
asi
the
identification
was
all
the
easier
since
it
justifies
the
epithet
by
the
violence
of
its
current
the
litâny
rises
a
short
distance
from
the
orontes
it
flows
at
first
through
a
wide
and
fertile
plain
which
soon
contracts
however
and
forces
it
into
a
channel
between
the
spurs
of
the
lebanon
and
the
galilæan
hills
the
water
thence
makes
its
way
between
two
cliffs
of
perpendicular
rock
the
ravine
being
in
several
places
so
narrow
that
the
branches
of
the
trees
on
the
opposite
sides
interlace

an
active
man
could
readily
leap
across
it

to

we
may
summarise
the
physical
characteristics
of

by
saying
that
nature
has
divided
the
country
into
five
or
six
regions
of
unequal
area
isolated
by
rivers
and
mountains
each
one
of
which
however
is
admirably
suited
to
become
the
seat
of
a
separate
independent
state

the
north
we
have
the
country
of
the
two
rivers
the
naharaim
extending
from
the
orontes
to
the

and
the

even
as

lebanon
lie

its
two
unequal
neighbours

of

to
the
south
is
the
varied
collection
of
provinces
bordering
the
valley
of

the
naharaim
of
the
egyptians
was
first
identified
with
mesopotamia
it
was
located
between
the
orontes
and
the
balikh
or
the
euphrates

maspero
this
opinion
is
now
adopted
by
the

of

differences

at

to
assert
with

approach
to
accuracy
what
peoples
inhabited
these
different
regions
towards
the
fourth
millennium
before
our
era
wherever
excavations
are
made
relics
are
brought
to

a
very
ancient
in

we
find
stone
weapons

implements
besides
pottery
often
elegant
in
contour

for
the
most

coarse
in

of
the

fashioned
them

study
of
the
geographical
nomenclature

about
the
xvith

the
existence
at
all

at

of

of
which
might
have
been
buried
in
that
tomb
but
once
across
the
orontes
other
forms
present
themselves
which
reveal
no
affinities
to
these
languages
but
are
apparently
connected
with
one
or
other
of
the
dialects
of
asia
minor
the
tenacity
with
which
the
once
given
cling
to
the
soil
leads
us
to
believe
that
a
certain
number
at
least
of
those
we
know
in
syria
were
in
use
there
long
before
they
were
noted
down
by
the
egyptians
and
that
they
must
have
been
heirlooms
from
very
early
peoples
as
they
take
a
semitic
or
form
according
to
their
geographical
position
we
may
conclude
that
the
centre
and
south
were
colonized
by
semites
and
the
north
by
the
immigrant
tribes
from
beyond
the
taurus
facts
are
not
wanting
to
support
this
conclusion
and
they
prove
that
it
is
not
so
entirely
arbitrary
as
we
might
be
inclined
to
believe

meaning
which
is
the
discovery

threw
doubt
on
the
reading
of
the

akharru
some
thought
that
it
ought
to
be
kept
in
any

others
with
more
or
less
certainty
think
that
it
should
be
replaced
by
amuru
amurru
the
country
of
the
amorites
but
the
question
has
now
been
settled
by
babylonian
contract
and
law
tablets
of
the
period
of
khaminurabi
in
which
the
name
is
written
ki
hommel
originated
the
idea
that
martu
might
be
an
abbreviation
of
amartu
that
is
amar
with
the
feminine
termination
of
nouns
in
the
canaanitish
dialect
martu
would
thus
actually
signify
country
of
the
probably
even
at
that
date
they
called
the
north
khati
and
amurru
the
land
of
the
amorites
the
scattered
references
in
their
writings
seem
to
indicate
frequent
intercourse
with
these
countries
and
that
too
as
a
matter
of
course
which
excited
no
surprise
among
their
contemporaries
a
journey
from
lagash
to
the
mountains
of
tidanum
and
to
gubin
or
to
the
lebanon
and
beyond
it
to
byblos
meant
to
them
no
voyage
of
discovery
armies
undoubtedly
followed
the
routes
already
frequented
by
caravans
and
flotillas
of
trading
boats
and
the
time
came
when
kings
desired
to
rule
as
sovereigns
over
nations
with
whom
their
subjects
had
peaceably
traded
the
name
of
the
khati
khatti
is
found
in
the
of
which
is
supposed
to
contain
an
extract
from
the
annals
of
sargon
and
naramsin
as
however
the
text
which
we
possess
of
it
is
merely
a
copy
of
the
time
of
assurbanipal
it
is
possible
that
the
word
khati
is
merely
the
translation
of
a
more
ancient
term
perhaps
martu
winckler
thinks
it
to
be
included
in
lesser
armenia
and
the
melitônê
of
classical
authors
gubin
is
probably
the
kûpûna
kûpnû
of
the
egyptians
the
byblos
of
phoenicia
amiaud
had
proposed
a
most
unlikely
identification
with
koptos
in
egypt
in
the
time
of
king
of
ur
mention
is
found
of
simurru
zimyra
it
does
not
appear
however
that
the
ancient
rulers
of
lagash
ever
extended
their
dominion
so
far
the
governors
of
the
northern
cities
on
the
other
hand
showed
themselves
more
energetic
and
inaugurated
that
march
westwards
which
sooner
or
later
brought
the
peoples
of
the
euphrates
into
collision
with
the
dwellers
on
the
nile
for
the
first
babylonian
empire
without
doubt
comprised
part
if
not
the
whole
of
syria
it
is
only
since
the
discovery
of
the
tel
tablets
that
the
fact
of
the
dominant
influence
of
chaldæa
over
syria
and
of
its
conquest
has
been
definitely
realized
it
is
now
clear
that
the
state
of
things
of
which
the
tablets
discovered
in
egypt
give
us
a
picture
could
only
be
explained
by
the
hypothesis
of
a
babylonish
supremacy
of
long
duration
over
the
peoples
situated
between
the
euphrates
and
the
mediterranean
among
the
most
celebrated
names
in
ancient
history
that
of
babylon
is
perhaps
the
only
one
which
still
suggests
to
our
minds
a
sense
of
vague
magnificence
and
undefined
dominion
cities
in
other
parts
of
the
world
it
is
true

rivalled
babylon
in
magnificence
and
power
egypt
could
boast
of
more
than
one
such
city
and
their
ruins
to
this
day
present
to
our
gaze
more
monuments
worthy
of
admiration
than
babylon
ever
contained
in
the
days
of
her
greatest
prosperity
the
pyramids
of
memphis
and
the
colossal
statues
of
thebes
still
stand
erect
while
the
ziggurâts
and
the
palaces
of
chaldæa
are
but
mounds
of
clay
crumbling
into
the
plain
but
the
egyptian
monuments
are
visible
and
tangible
objects
we
can
calculate
to
within
a
few
inches
the
area
they
cover
and
the
elevation
of
their
summits
and
the
very
precision
with
which
we
can
gauge
their
enormous
size
tends
to
limit
and
lessen
their
effect
upon
us
how
is
it
possible
to
give
free
rein
to
the
imagination
when
the
subject
of
it
is
strictly
limited
by
exact
and
determined
measurements
at
babylon
on
the
contrary
there
is
nothing
remaining

flight
of

at

a

so
closely
hemmed
in

of
bel
we
may
surmise
with
all
probability
that
the
history
of
babylon
in
early
times
resembled
in
the
main
that
of
the
egyptian
thebes
it
was
a
small
seigneury
in
the
hands
of
petty
princes
ceaselessly
at
war
with
petty
neighbours
bloody
struggles
with
alternating
successes
and
reverses
were
carried
on
for
centuries
with
no
decisive
results

the
day
came
when
some
more
energetic

fortunate
dynasty
at
length
crushed
its
rivals
and
united
under
one
rule
first
all
the
kingdoms
of
northern
and
finally
those
of
southern
chaldæa
the
lords
of
babylon
had
ordinarily
a
twofold
function
religious
and
military
the
priest
at
first
taking
precedence
of
the
soldier
but
gradually
yielding
to
the
latter
as
the
town
increased
in
power
they
were
merely
the
priestly
representatives
or
administrators
of
babel
and
their
authority
was
not
considered
legitimate

officially
confirmed
by
the
god
each
ruler
was
obliged
to
go
in
state
to
the
temple
of
bel
merodach
within
a
year
of
his
accession
there
he
had
to
take
the
hands
of
the
divine
statue
just
as
a
vassal
would
do
homage
to
his
liege
and
those
only
of
the
native
sovereigns
or
the
foreign
conquerors
could
legally
call
themselves
kings
of
babylon

had
not

performed
this
rite

renewed
it
annually

meaning
of
the
ceremony
in
which
the
kings
of
babylon
the
hands
of

been
given
by
winckler
tiele

it
very
aptly
with
the
rite
performed
by
the
egyptian
kings
at
heliopolis
for
example
when
they
entered
alone
the
sanctuary
of
râ
and
there
contemplated
the
god
face

the
rite
was
probably
repeated
annually
at
the
time
of
the
zakmuku
that
is
the
new

festival
sargon
the
elder
had
lived
in
babylon
and
had
built
himself
a
palace
there

the
tradition
of

times

to
this
city
the
glory
of
having
been
the
capital

to
late
times
was
connected
with
cruel
practices
generations
after
the
advent
to
power
of
the
abbasside
caliphs
his
faithful
worshippers
continued
to
sacrifice
to
him
human
victims
whose
heads
prepared
according
to
the
ancient
rite
were
accustomed
to
give
oracular
responses
the
government
of
the
surrounding
country
was
in
the
hands
of
princes
who
were
merely
vicegerents
chaldæan
civilization
before
the
beginnings
of
history
had
more
or
less
laid
hold
of
them
and
made
them
willing
subjects
to
the
kings
of
babylon
without
seeking
to
specify
exactly
which
were
the
doctrines
introduced
into
harranian
religion
subsequently
to
the
christian
era
we
may
yet
affirm
that
the
base
of
this
system
of
faith
was
merely
a
very
distorted
form
of
the
ancient
chaldæan
worship
practised
in
the
town
only
one
vicegerent
of
mesopotamia
is
known
at
present
and
he
belongs
to
the
assyrian
epoch
his
seal
is
preserved
in
the
british
museum
the
importance
of
harran
in
the
development
of
the
history
of
the
first
chaldæan
empire
was
pointed
out
by
winckler
but
the
theory
according
to
which
this
town
was
the
capital
of
the
kingdom
called
by
the
chaldæan
and
assyrian
scribes
kingdom
of
the
world
is
justly
combated
by
tiele
these
sovereigns
were
probably
at
the
outset
somewhat
obscure
personages
without
much
prestige
being
sometimes
independent
and
sometimes
subject
to
the
rulers
of
neighbouring
states
among
others
to
those
of
agadê
in
later
times
when
babylon
had
attained
to
universal
power
and
it
was
desired
to
furnish
her
kings
with
a
continuous
history
the
names
of
these
earlier
rulers
were
sought
out
and
added
to
those
of
such
foreign
princes
as
had
from
time
to
time
enjoyed
the
sovereignty
over
them
thus
forming
an
interminable
list
which
for
materials
and
authenticity
would
well
compare
with
that
of
the
thinite
pharaohs
this
list
has
come
down
to
us
incomplete
and
its
remains
do
not
permit
of
our
determining
the
exact
order
of
reigns
or
the
status
of
the
individuals
who
composed
it
we
find
in
it
in
the
period
immediately
subsequent
to
the
deluge
mention
of
mythical
heroes
followed
by
names
which
are
still
such
as
sargon
the
elder
the
princes
of
the
series
were
however
for
the
most
part
real
beings
whose
memories
had
been
preserved
by
tradition
or
whose
monuments
were
still
existing
in
certain
localities
towards
the
end
of
the
xxvth
century
before
our
era
however
a
dynasty
rose
into
power
of
which
all
the
members
come
within
the
range
of
history
this
dynasty
which
is
known
to
us
in
its
entirety
by
the
two
lists
of
smith
and
by
pinches
was
legitimately
composed
of
only
eleven
kings
and
was
known
as
the
babylonian
dynasty
although
sayce
suspects
it
to
be
of
arabian
origin
it
is
composed
as
follows
illustration
table
the
dates
of
this
dynasty
are
not
fixed
with
entire
certainty
the
first
of
them
sumuabîm
has
left
us
some
contracts
bearing
the
dates
of
one
or
other
of
the
fifteen
years
of
his
reign
and
documents
of
public
or
private
interest
abound
in
proportion
as
we
follow
down
the
line
of
his
successors
sumulaîlu
who
reigned
after
him
was
only
distantly
related
to
his
predecessor
but
from
sumulaîlu
to
the
kingly
power
was
transmitted
from
father
to
son
without
a
break
for
nine
generations
if
we
may
credit
the
testimony
of
the
official
lists
simulaîlu
also
written
whom
pinches
has
found
in
a
contract
tablet
associated
with
pungunila
as
king
was
not
the
son
of
sumuabîm
since
the
lists
do
not
mention
him
as
such
he
must
however
have
been
connected
with
some
sort
of
relationship
or
by
marriage
with
his
predecessor
since
both
are
placed
in
the
same
dynasty
a
few
contracts
of
sumulaîlu
are
given
by
meissner
samsuiluna
calls
him
forefather
the
fifth
king
before
hommel
believes
that
the
order
of
the
dynasties
has
been
reversed
and
that
the
first
upon
the
lists
we
possess
was
historically
the
second
he
thus
places
the
babylonian
dynasty
between
and
his
opinion
has
not
been
generally
adopted
but
every
assyriologist
dealing
with
this
period
proposes
a
different
date
for
the
reigns
in
this
dynasty
to
take
only
one
characteristic
example
khammurabi
is
placed
by
oppert
in
the
year
by
murdter
in
by
winckler
in
and
by
peiser
in
and
by
carl
niebuhr
in
contemporary
records
however
prove
that
the
course
of
affairs
did
not
always
run
so
smoothly
they
betray
the
existence
of
at
least
one
usurper
immêru
who
even
if
he
did
not
assume
the
royal
titles
enjoyed
the
supreme
power
for
several
years
between
the
reigns
of
zabu
and
abilsin
the
lives
of
these
rulers
closely
resembled
those
of
their
contemporaries
of
southern
chaldæa
they
dredged
the
ancient
canals
or
constructed
new
ones
they
restored
the
walls
of
their
fortresses
or
built
fresh
strongholds
on
the
frontier
they
religiously
kept
the
festivals
of
the
divinities
belonging
to
their
terrestrial
domain
to
whom
they
annually
rendered
solemn
homage
sumulaîlu
had
built
six
such
large
strongholds
of
brick
which
were
repaired
by
samsuiluna
five
generations
later
a
contract
of
sinmuballit
is
dated
the
year
in
which
he
built
the
great
wall
of
a
strong
place
the
name
of
which
is
unfortunately
illegible
on
the
fragment
which
we
possess
they
repaired
the
temples
as
a
matter
of
course
and
enriched
them
according
to
their
means
we
even
know
that
zabu
the
third
in
order
of
the
line
of
sovereigns
occupied
himself
in
building
the
sanctuary
eulbar
of
anunit
in
sippara
there
is
evidence
that
they
possessed
the
small
neighbouring
kingdoms
of
kishu
sippara
and
kuta
and
that
they
had
consolidated
them
into
a
single
state
of
which
babylon
was
the
capital
to
the
south
their
possessions
touched
upon
those
of
the
kings
of
uru
but
the
frontier
was
constantly
shifting
so
that
at
one
time
an
important
city
such
as
nippur
belonged
to
them
while
at
another
it
fell
under
the
dominion
of
the
southern
provinces
perpetual
war
was
waged
in
the
narrow
borderland
which
separated
the
two
rival
states
resulting
apparently
in
the
balance
of
power
being
kept
tolerably
equal
between
them
under
the
immediate
successors
of
the
obscure
sumulaîlu
zabum
the
usurper
immeru
abîlsin
and
sinmuballit
until
the
reign
of
khammurabi
the
son
of
sinmuballit
who
finally
made
it
incline
to
his
side
the
struggle
in
which
he
was
engaged
and
which
after
many
vicissitudes
he
brought
to
a
successful
issue
was
the
more
decisive
since
he
had
to
contend
against
a
skilful
and
energetic
adversary
who
had
considerable
forces
at
his
disposal
was
in
reality
of
elamite
race
and
as
he
held
the
province
of
yamutbal
in
appanage
he
was
enabled
to
muster
in
addition
to
his
chaldæan
battalions
the
army
of
foreigners
who
had
conquered
the
maritime
regions
at
the
mouth
of
the
tigris
and
the
euphrates
none
of
these
facts
are
as
yet
historically
proved
we
may
however
conjecture
with
some
probability
what
was
the
general
state
of
things
when
we
remember
that
the
first
kings
of
babylon
were
contemporaries
of
the
last
independent
sovereigns
of
southern
chaldæa
the
name
of
this
prince
has
been
read
in
several
ways
hammurabi
khammurabi
by
the
earlier
assyriologists
subsequently
hammuragash
khammuragash
as
being
of
elamite
or
cossoan
extraction
the
reading
khammurabi
is
at
present
the
prevailing
one
the
bilingual
list
published
by
pinches
makes
khammurabi
an
equivalent
of
the
semitic
names
rapashtum
hence
halévy
concluded
that
khammurabi
was
a
series
of
ideograms
and
that
kimtarapashtum
was
the
true
reading
of
the
name
his
proposal
partially
admitted
by
hommel
furnishes
us
with
a
mixed
reading
of
khammurapaltu
amraphel
hommel
is
now
convinced
of
the
identity
of
the
amraphel
of
xiv
i
with
te
sayce
moreover
adopts
the
reading
khammurabi
and
assigns
to
him
an
arabian
origin
the
part
played
by
this
prince
was
pointed
out
at
an
early
date
by
menant
recent
discoveries
have
shown
the
important
share
which
he
had
in
developing
the
chaldæan
empire
and
have
increased
his
reputation
with
assyriologists
the
name
of
this
king
has
been
the
theme
of
heated
discussions
it
was
at
first
pronounced
aradsin
ardusin
or
zikarsin
it
is
now
read
in
several
different
ways
rimsin
or
eriaku
riaku
rimagu
others
have
made
a
distinction
between
the
two
forms
and
have
made
out
of
them
the
names
of
two
different
kings
they
are
all
variants
of
the
same
name
i
have
adopted
the
form
rimsin
which
is
preferred
by
a
few
assyriologists
the
tablets
recently
discovered
by
pinches
referring
to
and
tudkhula
which
he
has
published
in
a
paper
road
before
the
victoria
institute
have
shown
that
the
true
reading
is
the
elamite
name
of
the
god
was
changed
by
some
of
his
subjects
into
the
babylonian
mercy
o
just
as
abêsukh
the
hebrew
father
of
was
transformed
into
the
babylonian
ebisum

it
was
not
the
first

the
affairs

neighbours

of

kings
khumbaba

ferocious

oppressed
uruk

with

as

measured
forces
with

with
no
decisive
issue
from
time
to

they
obtained
an
advantage

we
find
recorded
in

annals

only
by

reveals
to
us
a
mysterious
world
full
of
strange
names
and

over

presided

deity
who
was
called
shushinak

possibly
khumba

was
concealed
in
a
sanctuary
inaccessible
to
the
profane
but
it
was
dragged
from
thence
by
assurbanipal
of
nineveh
in
the
viith
century
this
deity
was
associated
with

were
divided
into

triads
shumudu
lagamaru
partikira
ammankasibar
uduran

of
these
names
the
least
repellent
ammankasibar
may
possibly
be
the
memnon
of
the
greeks
the
dwelling
of
these
divinities
was
near
susa
in
the
depths
of
a
sacred
forest
to
which
the
priests
and
kings
alone
had
access
their
images
were
brought
out
on
certain
days
to
receive
solemn
homage
and
were
afterwards
carried
back
to

by

the
elamite
armies
were
well
organized
and
under
a
skilful
general
became
irresistible
in
other
respects
the
elamites
closely
resembled
the
chaldæans
pursuing
the
same
industries
and
having
the
same
agricultural
and
commercial
instincts
in
the
absence
of
any
and
inscriptions
peculiar
to
this
people
we
may
glean
from
the
monuments
of
lagash
and
babylon
a
fair
idea
of
the
extent
of
their
civilization
in
its
earliest
stages
is
an
adjective
derived
from
the
name
of
the
town
of
susa
the
real
name
of
the
god
was
probably
kept
secret
and
rarely
uttered
the
names
which
appear
by
the
side
of
shushinak
in
the
text
published
by
rawlinson
as
equivalents
of
the
babylonian
ninip
perhaps
represent
different
deities
we
may
well
ask
whether
the
deity
may
not
be
the
khumba
umma
ummân
who
recurs
so
frequently
in
the
names
of
men
and
places
and
who
has
hitherto
never
been
met
with
alone
in
any
formula
or
dedicatory
tablet
the
cities
of
the
euphrates
therefore
could
have
been
sensible
of
but
little
change
when
the
chances
of
war
transferred
them
from
the
rule
of
their
native
princes
to
that
of
an
elamite
the
struggle
once
over
and
the
resulting
evils
repaired
as
far
as
practicable
the
people
of
these
towns
resumed
their
usual
ways
hardly
conscious
of
the
presence
of
their
foreign
ruler
the
victors
for
their
part
became
assimilated
so
rapidly
with
the
vanquished
that
at
the
close
of
a
generation
or
so
the
conquering
dynasty
was
regarded
legitimate
and
national
one
loyally
attached
to
the
traditions
and
religion
of
its
adopted
country

year

the
close

the
detention
of
their
goddess
and
a
hymn
of
lamentation
probably
composed
for
the
occasion
by

of

it
would

forced
to

shake
off

conceded

ability
for
he
claims
in

the
possession
of

whole
of

the
submission
of

is
evident
from
the
title

martu

the
west
assumed
by
several
of
the
elamite
princes
of
of
the
present
work
in
order
to
extend
his
authority
beyond
the
euphrates
it
was
necessary
for
the
king
of
elam
to
be
first
of
all
master
of
babylon
in
the
early
days
of
assyriology
it
was
supposed
that
this
period
of
elamite
supremacy
coincided
with
the
median
dynasty
of
berosus
his
preamble
contains
the
titles
martu
of
syria
of
the
word
seems
properly
to
mean
and
the
literal
translation
of
the
full
title
would
probably
be
of
syria
of
yamutbal
whence
the
secondary
meanings
lord
prince
which
have
been
provisionally
accepted
by
most
assyriologists
tiele
and
winckler
after
him
have
suggested
that
martu
is
here
equivalent
to
yamutbal
and
that
it
was
merely
used
to
indicate
the
western
part
of
elam
winckler
afterwards
rejected
this
hypothesis
and
has
come
round
to
the
general
opinion
he
obtained
a
victory
over
siniddinam
and
having
dethroned
him
placed
the
administration
of
the
kingdom
in
the
hands
of
his
own
son
eimsin
this
prince
who
was
at
first
a
feudatory
afterwards
associated
in
the
government
with
his
father
and
finally
sole
monarch
after
the
death
married
a
princess
of
chaldæan
blood
and
by
this
means
legitimatized
his
usurpation
in
the
eyes
of
his
subjects
his
domain
which
lay
on
both
sides
of
the
tigris
and
of
the
euphrates
comprised
besides
the
principality
of
yamutbal
all
the
towns
dependent
on
sumer

repaired
the
brickwork
in
the
temple
of

at

embellished
the

caused

was
out
of

and
the

threatened
to

he
pulled
it
down
and
rebuilt
it
carrying
it
to
such
a
height
that
its
summit
the
merodach
had
delegated
to
him
the

of

had
raised
him
to
the
rank
of

at
babylon
close
to
the
great

which
served
as

by
frequent
gifts
the
tradition
has
come
down
to
us
of
the
granary
for
wheat
which
he
built
at
babylon
the
sight
of
which
alone
rejoiced
the
heart
of
the

did

the

he
could
count
on
their
gratitude
in
securing
for
him
the
obedience
and
thus
prevent
the
outbreak
of
a
revolt
he
had
indeed
before
him
a
difficult
task
in
attempting
to
allay
the
ills
which
had
been
growing
during
centuries
of
civil
discord
and
foreign
conquest
the
irrigation
of
the
country
demanded
constant
attention
and
from
earliest
times
its
sovereigns
had
directed
the
work
with
real
solicitude
but
owing
to
the
breaking
up
of
the
country
into
small
states
their
respective
resources
could
not
be
combined
in
such
general
operations
as
were
needed
for
controlling
the
inundations
and
effectually
remedying
the
excess
or
the
scarcity
of

khammurabi
witnessed
the
damage
done
to
the
whole
province
of
umliyash
by
one
of
those
terrible
floods
which
still
sometimes
ravage
the
regions
of
the
lower
tigris
and
possibly
it
may
have
been
to
prevent
the
recurrence
of
such
a
disaster
that
he
undertook
the
work
of
canalization
contracts
dated
the
year
of
an
inundation
which
laid
waste
umliyash
cf
in
our

the
inundation
of

which
in
a

night
destroyed
half

of

and
in
which
fifteen
thousand
persons
lost
their
lives
either
by
drowning
or
by
the
collapse
of
their
houses
he
was
the
first
that
we
know
of
who
attempted
to
organize
and
reduce
to
a
single
system
the
complicated
network
of
ditches
and
channels
which
intersected
the
territory
belonging
to
the
great
cities
between
babylon
and
the

already
more
than
half
a

previously
siniddinam

enlarged

canalized
down
to

as
far
as
the

which
the

then
penetrated

of

this
canal
of
khammurabi
ran
from
a
little
south
of
babylon
joining
those
of
siniddinam
and
rimsin
and
probably
cutting
the
alluvial
plain
in
its
entire
length
it
drained
the
stagnant
marshes
on
either
side
along
its
course
and
by
its
fertilising
effects
the
dwellers
on
its
banks
were
enabled
to
reap
full
harvests
from
the

which
previously
had
been

separates

the
neighbourhood
of

khammurabi
did
not
rest
contented
with
these
a
system
of
secondary
canals
doubtless
completed
the
whole
scheme
of
irrigation
which
he
had
planned
after
the
achievement
of
his
conquest
and
his
successors
had
merely
to
keep
up
his
work
in
order
to
ensure
an
unrivalled
prosperity
to
the
empire
delattre
is
of
opinion
that
the
canal
dug
by
khammurabi
is
the
arakhtu
of
later
epochs
which
began
at
babylon
and
extended
as
far
as
the
larsa
canal
it
must
therefore
be
approximately
identified
with
the
of
the
present
day
which
joins
the
canal
of
siniddinam
the
canal
which
khammurabi
caused
to
be
dug
or
dredged
may
be
the
or
canal
which
ran
from
the
tigris
to
the
euphrates
passing
sippar
on
the

the
digging
of
this
canal
is
mentioned
in
a
contract
their
efforts
in
this
direction
were
not
unsuccessful
samsuîluna
the
son
of
khammurabi
added
to
the
existing
system
two
or
three
fresh
canals
one
at
least
of
which
still
bore
his
name
nearly
fifteen
centuries
later
it
is
mentioned
in
the
documents
of
the
second
assyrian
empire
in
the
time
of
assurbanipal
and
it
is
possible
that
traces
of
it
may
still
be
found
at

abîshukh

the

found
under
the
form
of

erroneously
read
samdiusatana
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
have
contracts
of
that
time
in
which
a
royal
name
is
plainly
written
as
samsusatana
we
should
know
nothing
of
these
kings
had
not
the
scribes
of
those
times
been
in
the
habit
of
dating
the
contracts
of
private
individuals
by
reference
to
important
national
events
they
appear
to
have
chosen
by
preference
incidents
in
the
religious
life
of
the
country
as
for
instance
the
restoration
of
a
temple
the
annual
enthronisation
of
one
of
the
great
divinities
such
as
shamash
merodach
ishtar
or
nana
as
the
eponymous
god
of
the
current
year
the
celebration
of
a
solemn
festival
or
the
consecration
of
a
statue
while
a
few
scattered
allusions
to
works
of
fortification
show
that
meanwhile
the
defence
of
the
country
was
jealously
watched
over
these
sovereigns
appear
to
have
enjoyed
long
reigns
the
shortest
extending
over
a
period
of
five
and
twenty
years
and
when
at
length
the
death
of
any
king
occurred
he
was
immediately
replaced
by
his
son
the
acts
and
the
judicial
documents
which
have
come
down
to
us
betraying
no
confusion
or
abnormal
delay
in
the
course
of
affairs
we
may
therefore
conclude
that
the
last
century
and
a
half
of
the
dynasty
was
a
period
of
peace
and
of
material
prosperity
chaldæa
was
thus
enabled
to
fully
reap
the
advantage
of
being
united
under
the
rule
of
one
individual
it
is
quite
possible
that
those
cities
uru
larsa
ishin
uruk
and
nippur
which
had
played
so
important
a
part
in
the
preceding
centuries
suffered
from
the
loss
of
their
prestige
and
from
the
blow
dealt
to
their
traditional
pretensions

to
be
up

this

they
had
claimed
the
privilege
of
controlling
the
history
of
their
country
and
they
had
bravely
striven
among
themselves
for
the
supremacy
over
the
southern
states
but
the
revolutions
which
had
raised
each
in
turn
to
the
zenith
of
power
had
never
exalted
any
one
of
them
to
such
an
eminence
as
to
deprive
its
rivals
of
all
hope
of
supplanting
it
and
of
enjoying
the
highest
place
the
rise
of
babylon
destroyed
the
last
chance
which
any
of
them
had
of
ever
becoming
the
capital
the
new
city
was
so
favourably
situated
and
possessed
so
much
wealth
and
so
many
soldiers
while
its
kings
displayed
such
tenacious
energy
that
its
neighbours
were
forced
to
bow
before
it
and
resign
themselves
to
the
subordinate
position
of
leading
provincial
towns
they
gave
a
loyal
obedience
to
the
officers
sent
them
from
the
north
and
sank
gradually
into
obscurity
the
loss
of
their
political
supremacy
being
somewhat
compensated
for
by
the
religious
respect
in
which
they
were
always
held
their
ancient
divinities
nana
sin
anu
and
ra
were
adopted
if
we
may
use
the
term
by
the
babylonians
who
claimed
the
protection
of
these
gods
as
fully
as
they
did
that
of
merodach
or
of
nebo
and
prided
themselves
on
amply
supplying
all
their
needs
as
the
inhabitants
of
babylon
had
considerable
resources
at
their
disposal
their
appeal
to
these
deities
might
be
regarded
as
productive
of
more
substantial
results
than
the
appeal
of
a
merely
local
kinglet
the
increase
of
the
national
wealth
and
the
concentration
under
one
head
of
armies
hitherto
owning
several
chiefs
enabled
the
rulers
not
of
babylon
or
larsa
alone
but
of
the
whole
of
chaldæa
to
offer
an
invincible
resistance
to
foreign
enemies
and
to
establish
their
dominion
in
countries
where
their
ancestors
had
enjoyed
merely
a
precarious
sovereignty
hostilities
never
completely
ceased
between
elam
and
babylon
if
arrested
for
a
time
they
broke
out
again
in
some
frontier
disturbance
at
times
speedily
suppressed
but
at
others
entailing
violent
consequences
and
ending
in
a
regular
war
no
document
furnishes
us
with
any
detailed
account
of
these
outbreaks
but
it
would
appear
that
the
balance
of
power
was
maintained
on
the
whole
with
tolerable
regularity
both
kingdoms
at
the
close
of
each
generation
finding
themselves
in
much
the
same
position
as
they
had
occupied
at
its
commencement

two
empires

separated

to
north

probably
fell
ordinarily
under
chaldæan
jurisdiction
umliyash
was
included
in
the
original
domain
of
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
was
evacuated
by
his
descendants
there
is
every
probability
that
they
possessed
the
plain
east
of
the
tigris
comprising
nineveh
and
arbela
and
that
the
majority
of
the
civilized
peoples
scattered
over
the
lower
slopes
of
the
kurdish
mountains
rendered
them
homage
they
kept
the
mesopotamian
under
their
suzerainty
and
we
may
affirm
without
exaggeration
that
their
power
extended
northwards
as
far
as
mount
masios
and
westwards
to
the
middle
course
of
the
euphrates
at
what
period
the
chaldæans
first
crossed
that
river
is
as
yet
unknown
many
of
their
rulers

their
inscriptions

the
title
of
suzerains

have
no
evidence
for
denying
their
pretensions
proclaims
himself
of
martu
lord
of
the
countries
of
the
west
and
we
are
in
the
possession
of
several
facts
which
suggest
the
idea
of
a
great
blamite
empire
with
a
dominion
extending
for
some
period
over
western
asia
the
existence
of
which
was
vaguely
hinted
at
by
the
greeks
who
attributed
its
glory
to
the
fabulous

contemporary
records
are
still
wanting

show

distant
possessions
from
one
of
his
predecessors
such
as
for
instance
or
whether
he
won
them
himself
at
the
point
of
the
sword
but
a
fragment
of
an
old
chronicle
inserted
in
the
hebrew
scriptures
speaks
distinctly
of
another
elamite
who
made
war
in
person
almost
up
to
the
egyptian
frontier
this
is
the
chedorlaomer
who
helped
eimsin
against
hammurabi
but
was
unable
to
prevent
his
overthrow
we
know
that
to
herodotus
susa
was
the
city
of
memnon
and
that
strabo
attributes
its
foundation
to
tithonus

of

in
the
main
fact
with
the
other
assyriologists
on
the
other
hand
the
majority
of
modern
biblical
critics
have
absolutely
refused
to
credit
the
story
in
genesis
sayce
thinks
that
the
bible
story
rests
on
an
historic
basis
and
his
view
is
strongly
confirmed
by
of
a
chaldæan
document
which
mentions
and
two
of
his
allies
the
hebrew
historiographer
reproduced
an
authentic
fact
from
the
chronicles
of
babylon
and
connected
it
with
one
of
the
events
in
the
life
of
abraham
the
very
late
date
generally
assigned
to
xiv
in
no
way
diminishes
the
intrinsic
probability
of
the
facts
narrated
by
the
chaldæan
document
which
is
preserved
to
us
in
the
pages
of
the
hebrew
book
in
the
thirteenth
year
of

of

in

by
the

character

a
hebrew
or
babylonian
scribe
who
had
no
other
means
of
telling
the
true
pronunciation
of
a
mentioned
in
the
story
of
this
campaign
would
have
been
quite
as
much
at
a
loss
as
any
modern
scholar
to
say
whether
he
ought
to
transcribe
the
word
as
or
as
some
scribes
read
it
others
preferred
xiii
in
deut
ii
it
is
stated
that
the
zamzummîm
lived
in
the
country
of
ammon
sayce
points
out
that
we
often
find
the
variant
am
for
the
character
usually
read
or
the
name
khammurabi
for
instance
is
often
found
written
ammurabi
the
ham
in
the
narrative
of
genesis
would
therefore
be
identical
with
the
land
of
ammon
in
deuteronomy
and
the
difference
between
the
spelling
of
the
two
would
be
due
to
the
fact
that
the
document
reproduced
in
the
xiviith
chapter
of
genesis
had
been
originally
copied
from
a
cuneiform
tablet
in
which
the
name
of
the
place
was
expressed
by
the
sign
in
the
mean
time
the
kings
of
the
five
towns
had
concentrated
their
troops
in
the
vale
of
siddîm
and
were
there
resolutely
awaiting
they
were
however
completely
routed
some
of
the
fugitives

swallowed
up
in
the
pits
of

with
which
the
soil
abounded

adding
that
he
was
overtaken
near
the
sources
of
the
jordan
by
the
patriarch
abraham
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
identify
the
three
vassals
of
with
kings
mentioned
on
the
chaldæan
monuments
tidcal
or
if
we
adopt
the
septuagint
variant
thorgal
has
been
considered
by
some
as
the
bearer
of
a
sumorian
name
chief
son
while
others
put
him
on
one
side
as
not
having
been
a
babylonian
pinches
sayce
and
hommel
identify
him
with
tudkhula
an
ally
of
against
khammurabi
schrader
was
the
first
to
suggest
that
amraphel
was
really
khammurabi
and
emended
the
amraphel
of
the
biblical
text
into
amraphi
or
amrabi
in
order
to
support
this
identification
halévy
while
on
the
whole
accepting
this
theory
derives
the
name
from
the
pronunciation
kimtarapashtum
or
kimtarapaltum
which
he
attributes
to
the
name
generally
read
khammurabi
and
in
this
he
is
partly
supported
by
hommel
who
reads
after
his
victory
over
khammurabi
assumed
the
title
of
king
of
martu
which
we
find
still
borne
by
ammisatana
sixty
years
later
we
see
repeated
here
almost
exactly
what
took
place
in
ethiopia
at
the
time
of
its
conquest
by
egypt
merchants
had
prepared
the
way
for
military
occupation
and
the
civilization
of
babylon
had
taken
hold
on
the
people
long
before
its
kings
had
become
sufficiently
powerful
to
claim
them
as
vassals
the
empire
may
be
said
to
have
been
virtually
established
from
the
day
when
the
states
of
the
middle
and
lower
euphrates
formed
but
one
kingdom
in
the
hands
of
a
single
ruler
we
must
not
however
imagine
it
to
have
been
a
compact
territory
divided
into
provinces
under
military
occupation
ruled
by
a
uniform
code
of
laws
and
statutes
and
administered
throughout
by
functionaries
of
various
grades
who
received
their
orders
from
babylon
or
susa
according
as
the
chances
of
war
favoured
the
ascendency
of
chaldæa
or
elam
it
was
in
reality
a
motley
assemblage
of
tribes
and
principalities
whose
sole
bond
of
union
was
subjection
to
a
common
yoke
it
is
indeed
the
sole
title
which
he
attributes
to
himself
on
a
stone
tablet
now
in
the
british
museum
in
an
inscription
by
this
prince
copied
probably
about
the
time
of
nabonidus
by
the
scribe
belushallîm
he
is
called
of
the
vast
land
of
they
were
under
obligation
to
pay
tribute
and
furnish
military
contingents
and
show
other
external
marks
of
obedience
but
their
particular
constitution
customs
and
religion
were
alike
respected
they
had
to
purchase
at
the
cost
of
a
periodical
ransom
the
right
to
live
in
their
own
country
after
their
own
fashion
and
the
head
of
the
empire
forbore
all
interference
in
their
affairs
except
in
cases
where
the
internecine
quarrels
and
dissensions
threatened
the
security
of
his
suzerainty
their
subordination
lasted
as
best
it
could
sometimes
for
a
year
or
for
ten
years
at
the
end
of
which
period
they
would
neglect
the
obligations
of
their
vassalage
or
openly
refuse
to
fulfil
them
a
revolt
would
then
break
out
at
one
point
or
another
and
it
was
necessary
to
suppress
it
without
delay
to
prevent
the
bad
example
from
spreading
far
and
wide
the
empire
was
maintained
by
perpetual
and
its
extent
varied
with
the
energy
shown
by
its
chiefs
or
with
the
resources
which
were
for
the
moment
available
separated
from
the
confines
of
the
empire
by
only
a
narrow
isthmus
egypt
loomed
on
the
horizon
and
appeared
to
beckon
to
her
rival
her
natural
fertility
the
industry
of
her
inhabitants
the
stores
of
gold
and
perfumes
which
she
received
from
the
heart
of
ethiopia
were
well
known
by
the
passage
to
and
fro
of
her
caravans
and
the
recollection
of
her
treasures
must
have
frequently
provoked
the
envy
of
asiatic
courts
egypt
had
however
strangely
declined
from
her
former
greatness
and
the
line
of
princes
who
governed
her
had
little
in
common
with
the
pharaohs
who
had
rendered
her
name
so
formidable
under
the
xiith
dynasty
she
was
now
under
the
rule
of
the
xoites
whose
influence
was
probably
confined
to
the
delta
and
extended
merely
in
name
over
the
said
and
nubia
the
feudal
lords
ever
ready
to
reassert
their
independence
as
soon
as
the
central
power
waned
shared
between
them
the
possession
of
the
nile
valley
below
memphis
the
princes
of
thebes
who
were
probably
descendants
of
usirtasen
owned
the
largest
fiefdom
and
though
some
slight
scruple
may
have
prevented
them
from
donning
the
pschënt
or
placing
their
names
within
a
cartouche
they
assumed
notwithstanding
the
plenitude
of
royal
power
a
favourable
opportunity
was
therefore
offered
to
an
invader
and
the
chaldæans
might
have
attacked
with
impunity
a
people
thus
divided
among
themselves
they
stopped
short
however
at
the
southern
frontier
of
syria
or
if
they
pushed
further
forward
it
was
without
any
important
result
distance
from
or
possibly
reiterated
attacks
of
the
elamites
prevented
them
from
placing
in
the
field
an
adequate
force
for
such
a
momentous
undertaking
what
they
had
not
dared
to
venture
others
more
audacious
were
to
accomplish
at
this
juncture
so
runs
the
egyptian
record
came
to
us
a
king
named
timaios
under
this
king
then
i
know
not
wherefore
the
god
caused
to
blow
upon
us
a
baleful
wind
and
in
the
face
of
all
probability
bands
from
the
east
people
of
ignoble
race
came
upon
us
unawares
attacked
the
country
and
subdued
it
easily
and
without
the
theory
that
the
divisions
of
egypt
under
the
xivth
dynasty
and
the
discords
between
its
feudatory
princes
were
one
of
the
main
causes
of
the
success
of
the
shepherds
is
now
admitted
to
be
correct
it
is
possible
that
they
owed
this
rapid
victory
to
the
presence
in
their
armies
of
a
factor
hitherto
unknown
to
the
african
the
and
before
the
horse
and
his
driver
the
egyptians
gave
way
in
a
body
the
invaders
appeared
as
a
cloud
of
locusts
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
towns
and
temples
were
alike
pillaged
burnt
and
ruined
they
massacred
all
they
could
of
the
male
population
reduced
to
slavery
those
of
the
women
and
children
whose
lives
they
spared
and
then
proclaimed
as
king
salatis
one
of
their
chiefs
he
established
a
semblance
of
regular
government
chose
memphis
as
his
capital
and
imposed
a
tax
upon
the
vanquished
two
perils
however
immediately
threatened
the
security
of
his
triumph
in
the
south
the
theban
lords
taking
matters
into
their
own
hands
after
the
downfall
of
the
xoites
refused
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
salatis
and
organized
an
obstinate
resistance
in
the
north
he
had
to
take
measures
to
protect
himself
against
an
attack
of
the
chaldæans
or
of
the
élamites
who
were
oppressing
chaldæa
the
horse
was
unknown
or
at
any
rate
had
not
been
employed
in
egypt
prior
to
the
invasion
we
find
it
however
in
general
use
immediately
after
the
expulsion
of
the
shepherds
see
the
tomb
of
pihiri
moreover
all
historians
agree
in
admitting
that
it
was
introduced
into
the
country
under
the
rule
of
the
shepherds
the
use
of
the
in
chaldæa
at
an
epoch
prior
to
the
hyksôs
invasion
is
proved
by
a
fragment
of
the
vulture
stele
it
is
therefore
natural
to
suppose
that
the
hyksôs
used
the
chariot
in
war
and
that
the
rapidity
of
their
conquest
was
due
to
it
the
name
salatis
var
saitôs
seems
to
be
derived
from
a
semitic
word
siialît
chief
governor
this
was
the
title
which
joseph
received
when
pharaoh
gave
him
authority
over
the
whole
of
egypt
xli
salatis
may
not
therefore
have
been
the
real
name
of
the
first
hyksôs
king
but
his
title
which
the
egyptians
misunderstood
and
from
which
they
evolved
a
proper
name
uhlemann
has
indeed
deduced
from
this
that
manetho
being
familiar
with
the
passage
referring
to
joseph
had
forged
the
name
of
salatis
ebers
imagined
that
he
could
decipher
the
egyptian
form
of
this
name
on
the
colossus
of
where
naville
has
since
read
with
certainty
the
name
of
a
pharaoh
of
the
xiiith
and
xivth
dynasties
nahsiri
the
text
of
manetho
speaks
of
taxes
which
he
imposed
on
the
high
and
low
lands
which
would
seem
to
include
the
thebaid
in
the
kingdom
it
is
however
stated
in
the
next
few
pages
that
the
successors
of
salatis
waged
an
incessant
war
against
the
egyptians
which
can
only
refer
to
hostilities
against
the
thebans
we
are
forced
therefore
to
admit
either
that
manetho
took
the
title
of
lord
of
the
high
and
low
lands
which
belonged
to
salatis
literally
or
that
the
thebans
after
submitting
at
first
subsequently
refused
to
pay
tribute
thus
provoking
a
war
manetho
here
speaks
of
assyrians
this
is
an
error
which
is
to
be
explained
by
the
imperfect
state
of
historical
knowledge
in
greece
at
the
time
of
the
macedonian
supremacy
we
need
not
for
this
reason
be
led
to
cast
doubt
upon
the
historic
value
of
the
narrative
we
must
remember
the
suzerainty
which
the
kings
of
babylon
exercised
over
syria
and
read
where
manetho
has
written
in
herodotus
is
the
regular
term
for
and
babylonia
is
called
land
of
the
from
the
natives
of
the
delta
who
were
temporarily
paralysed
by
their
reverses
he
had
for
the
moment
little
to
fear
restricting
himself
therefore
to
establishing
forts
at
the
strategic
points
in
the
nile
valley
in
order
to
keep
the
thebans
in
check
he
led
the
main
body
of
his
troops
to
the
frontier
on
the
isthmus
pacific
immigrations
had
already
introduced
asiatic
settlers
into
the
delta
and
thus
prepared
the
way
for
securing
the
supremacy
of
the
new
rulers
in
the
midst
of
these
strangers
and
on
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
town
of
in
the
nome
a
place
connected
by
tradition
with
the
myth
of
osiris
and
typhon
salatis
constructed
an
immense
entrenched
camp
capable
of
sheltering
two
hundred
and
forty
thousand
men
he
visited
it
yearly
to
witness
the
military
manoeuvres
to
pay
his
soldiers
and
to
preside
over
the
distribution
of
rations
this
permanent
garrison
protected
him
from
a
chaldæan
invasion
a
not
unlikely
event
as
long
as
syria
remained
under
the
supremacy
of
the
babylonian
kings
it
furnished
his
successors
also
with
an
inexhaustible
supply
of
trained
soldiers
thus
enabling
them
to
complete
the
conquest
of
lower
egypt
years
elapsed
before
the
princes
of
the
south
would
declare
themselves
vanquished
and
five

a
perpetual
warfare

of
tearing
up

very
these

kings
who
were
continually
under
arms
against
the
barbarians
were
subsequently
classed
in
a
dynasty

themselves
the
xvth
of
manetho
but
they
at
last
succumbed
to
the
invader
and
asses
became
master
of
the
entire
country
his
successors
in
their
turn
formed

dynasty

to
the
rocks
of
the
first
cataract
the
egyptians
who
witnessed
the
advent
of
this
asiatic
people
called
them
by
the
general
term
amûû
asiatics
or
monâtiû
the
men
of
the
desert
they
had
already
given
the
bedouin
the
opprobrious
epithet
of
shaûsû
pillagers
or
robbers
which
aptly
described
them
and
they
subsequently
applied
the
same
name
to
the
intruders
hiq
shaûsû
from
which
the
greeks
derived
their
word
hyksôs
or
hykoussôs
for
this
people
the
meaning
of
the
term
was
discovered
by
de
rougé
who
translated
it
and
applied
it
to
the
hyksôs
from
thence
it
passed
into
the
works
of
all
the
egyptologists
who
concerned
themselves
with
this
question
but
has
not
been
universally
accepted
as
the
meaning
of
the
word
it
is
generally
agreed
that
it
was
a
generic
term
indicating
the
races
with
which
their
conquerors
were
supposed
to
be
connected
and
not
the
particular
term
of
which
word
would
be
the
literal
translation
the
name
seems
in
fact
to
be
derived
from
a
word
which
meant
rob
the
name
shausu
shosu
was
not
used
by
the
egyptians
to
indicate
a
particular

was

of
all
bedouins
and
in

of
all
the
marauding
tribes
who
infested
the
desert
or
the
mountains
the
shausu
most
frequently
referred
to
on
the
monuments
are
those
from
the
desert
between
egypt
and
syria
but
there
is
a
reference
in
the
time
of
ramses
to
those
from
the
lebanon
and
the
valley
of
orontes
krall
finds
an
allusion
to
them
in
a
word
in
ii
which
is
generally
translated
by
a
generic
expression
manetho
declares
that
the
people
were
called
hyksôs
from
which
means
in
the
sacred
language
and
which
means
in
the
popular
language
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
word
means
the
classical
language
of
egypt
or
as
manetho
styles
it
the
in
the
idiom
of
the
old
religious
historical
and
literary
texts
which
in
later
ages
the
populace
no
longer
understood
shôs
on
the
contrary
belongs
to
the
spoken
language
of
the
later
time
and
does
not
occur
in
the
ancient
inscriptions
so
that
explanation
is
valueless
there
is
but
one
material
fact
to
be
retained
from
his
evidence
and
that
is
the
name
or
given
by
its
inventors
to
the
alien
kings
and
rosellini
were
the
first
to
identify
these
shôs
with
the
shaûsû
whom
they
found
represented
on
the
monuments
and
their
opinion
adopted
by
some
seems
to
me
an
extremely
plausible
one
the
egyptians
at
a
given
moment
bestowed
the
generic
name
of
shaûsû
on
these
strangers
just
as
they
had
given
those
of
amûû
and
manâtiû
the
texts
or
writers
from
whom
manetho
drew
his
information
evidently
mentioned
certain
kings
other
passages
or
the
same
passages
wrongly
interpreted
were
applied
to
the
race
and
were
rendered
taken
from
the
shaûsû
a
substantive
derived
from
the
root
being
substituted
for
the
noun
josephus
declares
on
the
authority
of
manetho
that
some
manuscripts
actually
suggested
this
derivation
a
fact
which
is
easily
explained
by
the
custom
of
the
egyptian
record
offices
i
may
mention
in
passing
that
mariette
recognised
in
the
element
an
egyptian
word
and
in
the
name
of
king
mîrmâshâû
which
he
read
mîrshôsû
an
equivalent
of
the
title
shôsû
but
we
are
without
any
clue
as
to
their
real
name
language
or
origin
the
writers
of
classical
times
were
unable
to
come
to
an
agreement
on
these
questions
some
confounded
the
hyksôs
with
the
phoenicians
others
regarded
them
as
arabs
modern
scholars
have
put
forward
at
least
a
dozen
contradictory
hypotheses
on
the
matter
the
hyksôs
have
been
asserted
to
have
been
canaanites
elamites
hittites
accadians
scythians
the
last
opinion
found
great
favour
with
the
learned
as
long
as
they
could
believe
that
the
sphinxes
discovered
by
mariette
represented
apôphis
or
one
of
his
predecessors
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
monuments
present
all
the
characteristics
of
the
mongoloid
type
of
countenance
the
small
and
slightly
oblique
eyes
the
arched
but
somewhat
flattened
nose
the
pronounced
cheekbones
and
jaw
the
salient
chin
and
full
lips
slightly
depressed
at
the
corners
these
peculiarities
are
also
observed
in
the
three
heads
found
at
damanhur
in
the
colossal
torso
dug
up
at
in
the
fayum
in
the
twin
figures
of
the
nile
removed
to
the
bulaq
museum
from
tanis
and
upon
the
remains
of
a
statue
in
the
collection
at
the
villa
ludovisi
in
rome
the
same
foreign
type
of
face
is
also
found
to
exist
among
the
present
inhabitants
of
the
villages
scattered
over
the
eastern
part
of
the
delta
particularly
on
the
shores
of
lake
menzaleh
and
the
conclusion
was
drawn
that
these
people
were
the
direct
descendants
of
the
hyksôs
manetho
takes
them
to
be
phoenicians
but
he
adds
that
certain
writers
thought
them
to
be
arabs
brugsch
favours
this
latter
view
but
the
arab
legend
of
a
conquest
of
egypt
by
sheddâd
and
the
adites
is
of
recent
origin
and
was
inspired
by
traditions
in
regard
to
the
hyksôs
current
during
the
byzantine
epoch
we
can
not
therefore
allow
it
to
influence
us
we
must
wait
before
expressing
a
definite
opinion
in
regard
to
the
facts
which
glaser
believes
he
has
obtained
from
the
minoan
inscriptions
which
date
from
the
time
of
the
hyksôs
mariette
who
was
the
first
to
describe
these
curious
monuments
recognised
in
them
all
the
incontestable
characteristics
of
a
semitic
type
and
the
correctness
of
his
view
was
at
first
universally
admitted
later
on
hamy
imagined
that
he
could
distinguish
traces
of
mongolian
influences
and
er
lenormant
and
then
mariette
himself
came
round
to
this
view
it
has
recently
been
supported
in
england
by
flower
and
in
germany
by
virchow
this
theory
was
abandoned
however
when
it
was
ascertained
that
the
sphinxes
of
san
had
been
carved
many
centuries
before
the
invasion
for
amenemhâît
a
king
of
the
xiith
dynasty
in
spite
of
the
facts
we
possess
the
problem
therefore
still
remains
unsolved
and
the
origin
of
the
hyksôs
is
as
mysterious
as
ever
we
gather
however
that
the
third
millennium
before
our
era
was
repeatedly
disturbed
by
considerable
migratory
movements
the
expeditions
far
afield
of
elamite
and
chaldæan
princes
could
not
have
taken
place
without
seriously
perturbing
the
regions
over
which
they
passed
they
must
have
encountered
by
the
way
many
nomadic
or
unsettled
tribes
whom
a
slight
shock
would
easily
displace
an
impulse
once
given
it
needed
but
little
to
accelerate
or
increase
the
movement
a
collision
with
one
horde
reacted
on
its
neighbours
who
either
displaced
or
carried
others
with
them
and
the
whole
multitude
gathering
momentum
as
they
went
were
precipitated
in
the
direction
first
given
the
hyksôs
invasion
has
been
regarded
as
a
natural
result
of
the
elamite
conquest
a
tradition
picked
up
by
herodotus
on
his
travels
relates
that
the
phoenicians
had
originally
peopled
the
eastern
and
southern
shores
of
the
persian
gulf
it
was
also
said
that
indathyrses
a
scythian
king
had
victoriously
scoured
the
whole
of
asia
and
had
penetrated
as
far
as
egypt
either
of
these
invasions
may
have
been
the
cause
of
the
syrian
migration
in
comparison
with
the
meagre
information
which
has
come
down
to
us
under
the
form
of
legends
it
is
provoking
to
think
how
much
actual
fact
has
been
lost
a
tithe
of
which
would
explain
the
cause
of
the
movement
and
the
mode
of
its
execution
the
least
improbable
hypothesis
is
that
which
attributes
the
appearance
of
the
shepherds
about
the
xxiiird
century
to
the
arrival
in
naharaim
of
those
khati
who
subsequently
fought
so
obstinately
against
the
armies
both
of
the
pharaohs
and
the
ninevite
kings
they
descended
from
the
mountain
region
in
which
the
halys
and
the
euphrates
take
their
rise
and
if
the
bulk
of
them
proceeded
no
further
than
the
valleys
of
the
taurus
and
the
amanos
some
at
least
must
have
pushed
forward
as
far
as
the
provinces
on
the
western
shores
of
the
dead
sea
the
most
adventurous
among
them
reinforced
by
the
canaanites
and
other
tribes
who
had
joined
them
on
their
southward
course
crossed
the
isthmus
of
suez
and
finding
a
people
weakened
by
discord
experienced
no
difficulty
in
replacing
the
native
dynasties
by
their
own
barbarian
chiefs
it
was
to
the
exodus
of
this
race
in
the
last
analysis
that
the
invasion
of
the
shepherds
may
be
attributed
a
certain
number
of
commentators
are
of
opinion
that
the
wars
attributed
to
indathyrses
have
been
confounded
with
what
herodotus
tells
of
the
exploits
of
madyes
and
are
nothing
more
than
a
distorted
remembrance
of
the
great
scythian
invasion
which
took
place
in
the
latter
half
of
the
viith
century
at
the
present
time
those
scholars
who
admit
the
turanian
origin
of
the
hyksôs
are
of
opinion
that
only
the
nucleus
of
the
race
the
royal
tribe
was
composed
of
mongols
while
the
main
body
consisted
of

of

of

by

from

that
it
was
more
to

interest
to
exploit
the
country
than
to
pillage
it

however
none

was

were

the

than
the

a

down
to

would
seem
to
have
been
recopied
if

in

of
apôphis
il
aûsirrî
if
we
only
possessed
more
monuments
or
documents
treating
of
this
period
we
should
doubtless
perceive
that
their
sojourn
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
was
instrumental
in
causing
a
speedy
change
in
the
appearance
and
character
of
the
hyksôs
the
strangers
retained
to
a
certain
extent
their
coarse
countenances
and
rude
manners
they
showed
no
aptitude
for
tilling
the
soil
or
sowing
grain
but
delighted
in
the
marshy
expanses
of
the
delta
where
they
gave
themselves
up
to
a
life
of
hunting
and
of
tending
cattle
the
nobles
among
them
clothed
and
schooled
after
the
egyptian
fashion
and
holding
fiefs
or
positions
at
court
differed
but
little
from
the
native
feudal
chiefs
we
see
here
a
case
of
what
generally
happens
when
a
horde
of
barbarians
settles
down
in
a
highly
organised
country
which
by
a
stroke
of
fortune
they
may
have
conquered
as
soon
as
the
hyksôs
had
taken
complete
possession
of
egypt
egypt
in
her
turn
took
possession
of
them
and
those
who
survived
the
enervating
effect
of
her
civilization
were
all
but
transformed
into
egyptians
if
in
the
time
of
the
native
pharaohs
asiatic
tribes
had
been
drawn
towards
egypt
where
they
were
treated
as
subjects
or
almost
as
slaves
the
attraction
which
she
possessed
for
them
must
have
increased
in
intensity
under
the
shepherds
they
would
now
find
the
country
in
the
hands
of
men
of
the
same
races
as
themselves
egyptianised
it
is
true
but
not
to
such
an
extent
as
to
have
completely
lost
their
own
language
and
the
knowledge
of
their
own
extraction
such
immigrants
were
the
more
readily
welcomed
since
there
lurked
a
feeling
among
the
hyksôs
that
it
was
necessary
to
strengthen
themselves
against
the
slumbering
hostility
of
the
indigenous
population
the
royal
palace
must
have
more
than
once
opened
its
gates
to
asiatic
counsellors
and
favourites
canaanites
and
bedouin
must
often
have
been
enlisted
for
the
camp
at
avaris
invasions
famines
civil
wars
all
seem
to
have
conspired
to
drive
into
egypt
not
only
isolated
individuals
but
whole
families
and
tribes
that
of
the
or
israelites
who
entered
the
country
about
this
time
has
since
acquired
a
unique
position
in
the
history
they
belonged
to
that
family
of
semitic
extraction
which
we
know
by
the
monuments
and
tradition
to
have
been
scattered
in
ancient
times
along
the
western
shores
of
the
persian
gulf
and
on
the
banks
of
the
euphrates
those
situated
nearest
to
chaldæa
and
to
the
sea
probably
led
a
settled
existence
they
cultivated
the
soil
they
employed
themselves
in
commerce
and
industries
their
vessels
from
dilmun
from
mâgan
and
from
milukhkha
coasted
from
one
place
to
another
and
made
their
way
to
the
cities
of
sumer
and
accad
they
had
been
civilized
from
very
early
times
and
some
of
their
towns
were
situated
on
islands
so
as
to
be
protected
from
sudden
incursions
other
tribes
of
the
same
family
occupied
the
interior
of
the
continent
they
lived
in
tents
and
delighted
in
the
unsettled
life
of
nomads
there
appeared
to
be
in
this
distant
corner
of
arabia
an
inexhaustible
reserve
of
population
which
periodically
overflowed
its
borders
and
spread
over
the
world
it
was
from
this
very
region
that
we
see
the
kashdim
the
true
chaldæans
issuing
ready
armed
for
combat
a
people
whose
name
was
subsequently
used
to
denote
several
tribes
settled
between
the
lower
waters
of
the
tigris
and
the
euphrates
it
was
there
among
the
marshes
on
either
side
of
these
rivers
that
the
aramoans
established
their
first
settlements
after
quitting
the
desert
there
also
the
oldest
legends
of
the
race
placed
the
cradle
of
the
phoenicians
it
was
even
believed
about
the
time
of
alexander
that
the
earliest
ruins
attributable
to
this
people
had
been
discovered
on
the
bahrein
islands
the
largest
of
which
tylos
and
arados
bore
names
resembling
the
two
great
ports
of
tyre
and
arvad
we
are
indebted
to
tradition
for
the
cause
of
their
emigration
and
the
route
by
which
they
reached
the
mediterranean
the
occurrence
of
violent
earthquakes
forced
them
to
leave
their
home
they
travelled
as
far
as
the
lake
of
syria
where
they
halted
for
some
time
then
resuming
their
march
did
not
rest
till
they
had
reached
the
sea
where
they
founded
sidon
the
question
arises
as
to
the
position
of
the
lake
of
syria
on
whose
shores
they
rested
some
believing
it
to
be
the
and
the
environs
of
babylon
others
the
lake
of
bambykês
near
the
euphrates
the
emigrants
doubtless
having
followed
up
the
course
of
that
river
and
having
approached
the
country
of
their
destination
on
its
frontier
another
theory
would
seek
to
identify
the
lake
with
the
waters
of
merom
the
lake
of
galilee
or
the
dead
sea
in
this
case
the
horde
must
have
crossed
the
neck
of
the
arabian
peninsula
from
the
euphrates
to
the
jordan
through
one
of
those
long
valleys
sprinkled
with
oases
which
afforded
an
occasional
route
for
caravans
several
writers
assure
us
that
the
phoenician
tradition
of
this
exodus
was
misunderstood
by
herodotus
and
that
the
sea
which
they
remembered
on
reaching
tyre
was
not
the
persian
gulf
but
the
dead
sea
if
this
had
been
the
case
they
need
not
have
hesitated
to
assign
their
departure
to
causes
mentioned
in
other
documents
the
bible
tells
us
that
soon
after
the
invasion
of
the
anger
of
god
being
kindled
by
the
wickedness
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
he
resolved
to
destroy
the
five
cities
situated
in
the
valley
of
siddim
a
cloud
of
burning
brimstone
broke
over
them
and
consumed
them
when
the
fumes
and
smoke
as
a
furnace
had
passed
away
the
very
site
of
the
towns
had
disappeared
previous
to
their
destruction
the
lake
into
which
the
jordan
empties
itself
had
had
but
a
restricted
area
the
subsidence
of
the
southern
plain
which
had
been
occupied
by
the
impious
cities
doubled
the
size
of
the
lake
and
enlarged
it
to
its
present
dimensions
the
earthquake
which
caused
the
phoenicians
to
leave
their
ancestral
home
may
have
been
the
result
of
this
cataclysm
and
the
sea
on
whose
shores
they
sojourned
would
thus
be
our
dead
sea
they
would
thus
have
arrived
at
the
shores
of
lake
merom
or
at
the
shores
either
of
the
dead
sea
or
of
the
lake
of
gennesareth
the
arab
traditions
speak
of
an
itinerary
which
would
have
led
the
emigrants
across
the
desert
but
they
possess
no
historic
value
is
so
far
as
these
early
epochs
are
concerned
xix
the
whole
of
this
episode
belongs
to
the
jehovistic
narrative
one
fact
however
appears
to
be
certain
in
the
midst
of
many
hypotheses
and
that
is
that
the
phoenicians
had
their
origin
in
the
regions
bordering
on
the
persian
gulf
it
is
useless
to
attempt
with
the
inadequate
materials
as
yet
in
our
possession
to
determine
by
what
route
they
reached
the
syrian
coast
though
we
may
perhaps
conjecture
the
period
of
their
arrival
herodotus
asserts
that
the
tyrians
placed
the
date
of
the
foundation
of
their
principal
temple
two
thousand
three
hundred
years
before
the
time
of
his
visit
and
the
erection
of
a
sanctuary
for
their
national
deity
would
probably
take
place
very
soon
after
their
settlement
at
tyre
this
would
bring
their
arrival
there
to
about
the
xxviiith
century
before
our
era
the
elamite
and
babylonian
conquests
would
therefore
have
found
the
phoenicians
already
established
in
the
country
and
would
have
had
appreciable
effect
upon
them
the
question
now
arises
whether
the
belonged
to
the
group
of
tribes
which
included
the
phoenicians
or
whether
they
were
of
chaldæan
race
their
national
traditions
leave
no
doubt
upon
that
point
they
are
regarded
as
belonging
to
an
important
race
which
we
find
dispersed
over
the
country
of
in
northern
mesopotamia
near
the
base
of
mount
masios
and
extending
on
both
sides
of
the
euphrates
the
country
of
is
situated
between
the
euphrates
and
the
upper
reaches
of
the
khabur
on
both
sides
of
the
balikh
and
is
usually
explained
as
the
or
of
aram
though
the
etymology
is
not
certain
the
word
seems
to
be
preserved
in
that
of
near
harrân
their
earliest
chiefs
bore
the
names
of
towns
or
of
peoples
n
akhor
peleg
and
serug
all
were
descendants
of
arphaxad
and
it
was
related
that
terakh
the
direct
ancestor
of
the
israelites
had
dwelt
in
the
ur
or
uru
of
the
chaldæans
he
is
said
to
have
had
three
sons
abraham
nakhôr
and
harân
harân
begat
lot
but
died
before
his
father
in
his
own
country
abraham
and
nakhor
both
took
wives
but
wife
remained
a
long
time
barren
then
terakh
with
his
son
abraham
his
grandson
lot
the
son
of
harân
and
his
sarah
went
forth
from
ur
of
the
chaldees
to
go
into
the
land
of
canaan
nakhôr
has
been
associated
with
the
ancient
village
of
khaura
or
with
the
ancient
village
of
to
the
south
of
anah
peleg
probably
corresponds
with
phalga
or
phaliga
which
was
situated
at
the
mouth
of
the
khabur
serug
with
the
present
sarudj
in
the
neighbourhood
of
edessa
and
the
other
names
in
the
genealogy
were
probably
borrowed
from
as
many
different
localities
the
site
of
arphaxad
is
doubtful
as
is
also
its
meaning
its
second
element
is
undoubtedly
the
name
of
the
chaldæans
but
the
first
is
interpreted
in
several
ways
of
the
chaldæans
of
the
the
similarity
of
sound
was
the
cause
of
its
being
for
a
long
time
associated
with
the
arrapakhitis
of
classical
times
the
tendency
is
now
to
recognise
in
it
the
country
nearest
to
the
ancient
domain
of
the
chaldæans
babylonia
proper
has
long
been
sought
for
in
the
north
either
at
orfa
in
accordance
with
the
tradition
of
the
syrian
churches
still
existing
in

in

certain

of

placed
by
ammianus
marcellinus
between
nisibis
and
the
tigris
at
the
present
day
halévy
still
looks
for
it
on
the
syrian
bank
of
the
euphrates
to
the
of
thapsacus
proposal
to
identify
it
with
the
town
of
uru
has
been
successively
accepted
by
nearly
all
assyriologists
sayce
remarks
that
the
worship
of
sin
which
was
common
to
both
towns
established
a
natural
link
between
them
and
that
an
inhabitant
of
uru
would
have
felt
more
at
home
in
harrân
than
in
any
other
town
the
names
of
sarah
and
abraham
or
rather
the
earlier
form
abram
have
been
found
the
latter
under
the
form
abirâmu
in
the
contracts
of
the
first
chaldæan
empire
and
they
came
unto
kharân
and
dwelt
there
and
terakh
died
in
kharân
it
is
a
question
whether
kharân
is
to
be
identified
with
harrân
in
mesopotamia
the
city
of
the
god
sin
or
which
is
more
probable
with
the
syrian
town
of
haurân
in
the
neighbourhood
of
damascus
the
tribes
who
crossed
the
euphrates
became
subsequently
a
somewhat
important
people
they
called
themselves
or
were
known
by
others
as
the
or
hebrews
the
people
from
beyond
the
river
and
this
appellation
which
we
are
accustomed
to
apply
to
the
children
of
israel
only
embraced
also
at
the
time
when
the
term
was
most
extended
the
ammonites
moabites
edomites
ishmaelites
midianites
and
many
other
tribes
settled
on
the
borders
of
the
desert
to
the
east
and
south
of
the
dead
sea
xi
in
the
opinion
of
most
critics
verses
form
part
of
the
document
which
was
the
basis
of
the
various
narratives
still
traceable
in
the
bible
it
is
thought
that
the
remaining
verses
bear
the
marks
of
a
later
redaction
or
that
they
may
be
additions
of
a
later
date
the
most
important
part
of
the
text
that
relating
the
migration
from
to
kharân
belongs
therefore
to
the
very
oldest
part
of
the
national
tradition
and
may
be
regarded
as
expressing
the
knowledge
which
the
hebrews
of
the
times
of
the
kings
possessed
concerning
the
origin
of
their
race
the
most
ancient
interpretation
identified
this
nameless
river
with
the
euphrates
an
identification
still
admitted
by
most
critics
others
prefer
to
recognise
it
as
being
the
jordan
halévy
prefers
to
identify
it
with
one
of
the
rivers
of
damascus
probably
the
abana
these
peoples
all
traced
their
descent
from
abraham
the
son
of
terakh
but
the
children
of
israel
claimed
the
privilege
of
being
the
only
legitimate
issue
of
his
marriage
with
sarah
giving
naïve
or
derogatory
accounts
of
the
relations
which
connected
the
others
with
their
common
ancestor
ammon
and
moab
were
for
instance
the
issue
of
the
incestuous
union
of
lot
and
his
daughters
midian
and
his
sons
were
descended
from
keturah
who
was
merely
a
concubine
ishmael

the
son
of
an
egyptian
slave
while
the
esau
had
sold
his
birthright
and
the
primacy
of
the
edomites
to
his
brother
jacob
and
consequently
to
the
israelites
for
a
dish
of
lentils
abraham
left
kharân
at
the
command
of
jahveh
his
god
receiving
from
him
a
promise
that
his
posterity
should
be
blessed
above
all
others
abraham
pursued
his
way
into
the
heart
of
canaan
till
he
reached
shechem
and
there
under
the
oaks
of
moreh
jahveh
appearing
to
him
a
second
time
announced
to
him
that
he
would
give
the
whole
land
to
his
posterity
as
an
inheritance
abraham
virtually
took
possession
of
it
and
wandered
over
it
with
his
flocks
building
altars
at
shechem
bethel
and
mamre
the
places
where
god
had
revealed
himself
to
him
treating
as
his
equals
the
native
chiefs
abîmelech
of
gerar
and
melchizedek
of
jerusalem
and
granting
the
valley
of
the
jordan
as
a
place
of
pasturage
to
his
nephew

flocks
had
increased
immensely
his
nomadic
instinct

led
him
into

was
here
robbed

meeting
with
melchizedek
after
the
victory
over

and
the
agreement
with
abîmelech
about

the
mention
of
the

of
abraham
with
abîmelech
belongs
to
the
oldest
part
of
the
national
tradition
and
is
given
to
us
in
the
jehovistic
narrative
many
critics
have
questioned
the
historical
existence
of
melchizedek
and
believed
that
the
passage
in
which
he
is
mentioned
is
merely
a
kind
of
parable
intended
to
show
the
head
of
the
race

to
the

the
information
however
furnished
by
the
tablets
about
the
ancient
city
of

character
of
its
early
kings
have
determined

historical
personage

out
in

and
succeeded
in

god
jahveh
not

favoured
him
on
every
occasion
but
expressed
his
will
to
extend
over
descendants
his
sheltering
protection
he
made

lo
an
horror
of

fell
upon

a

from
on

said
to
him
of

that
thy

in

themselves
before

he

the

came
from

herself

laugh
there
is
a

many
critics
see
in
the
life
of
isaac
a
colourless
copy
of
that
of

others
on

contrary
consider
that
the
primitive
episodes
belonged
to
the
former
and
that
the

portions
of

shameless
advances

accused

being
cast
into

he
astonished
his
companions
in
misfortune
by

skill
in
reading
dreams

was
summoned
to
court
to
interpret
to
the
king
his
dream
of
the
seven
lean
kine
who
had
devoured
the
seven
fat
kine
which
he
did
by
representing
the
latter
as
seven
years
of
abundance
of
which
the
crops
should
be
swallowed
up
by
seven
years

joseph

he
stored
up
the
surplus
of

abundant
harvests
and
as
soon
as

broke
out
distributed
the
corn
to
the
people
in
exchange
for
their
silver
and
gold
and
for
their
flocks

fields
hence
it
was
that
the
whole
of
the
nile
valley
with
the
exception
of
the
lands
belonging
to
the

gradually
passed
into
the
possession

treasury
meanwhile
his
brethren
who
also
suffered
from
the
famine
came
down
into
egypt
to
buy
corn
joseph
revealed
himself
to
them
pardoned
the
wrong
they
had
done
him
and
presented
them
to

had
served
as
their
the
broad
but
scantily
watered
wadys
separating
the
cultivated
lands
from
the
desert
were
to
them
a
patrimony
which
they
shared
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
neighbouring
towns
every
year
in
the
spring
they
led
their
flocks
to
browse
on
the
thin
herbage
growing
in
the
bottoms
of
the
valleys
removing
them
to
another
district
only
when
the
supply
of
fodder
was
exhausted
the
women

and
devoted
themselves
to

they
suckled
beyond
the
usual

the
men
lived
like
the
bedouin
periods
of
activity
alternating
regularly
with
times
of
idleness
and
the
daily
routine
with
its
simple
duties
and
casual
work
often
gave
place
to
quarrels
for
the
possession
of
some
rich
pasturage
or
some
well
a
comparatively
ancient
tradition
relates
that
the
hebrews
arrived
in
egypt
during
the
reign
of
aphôbis
a
hyksôs
king
doubtless
one
of
the
apôpi
and
possibly
the
monarch
who
restored
the
monuments
of
the
theban
pharaohs
and
engraved
his
name
on
the
sphinxes
of

the

obtained
is
that
which
down

frequently
visited

find
there
an
uncertain
hospitality
the
year
xvii
of
apôphis
has
been
pointed
out
as
the
date
of
their
arrival
and
this
combination
probably
proposed
by
some
learned
jew
of
alexandria
was
adopted
by
christian
chroniclers
it
is
unsupported
by
any
fact
of
egyptian
history
but
it
rests
on
a
series
of
calculations
founded
on
the
information
contained
in
the
bible
starting
from
the
assumption
that
the
exodus
must
have
taken
place
under
ahmosîs
and
that
the
children
of
israel
had
been
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
it
was
found
that
the
beginning
of
their
sojourn
fell
under
the
reign
of
the
apôphis
mentioned
by
josephus
and
to
be
still
more
correct
in
the
xviith
year
of
that
prince
the
tribes
of
the
isthmus
of
suez
are
now
in
fact
constantly
shifting
from
one
continent
to
another
and
their
encampments
in
any
place
are
merely
temporary
the
lord
of
the
soil
must
if
he
desire
to
keep
them
within
his
borders
treat
them
with
the
greatest
prudence
and
tact
should
the
government
displease
them
in
any
way
or
appear
to
curtail
their
liberty
they
pack
up
their
tents

in

by
the

of

were
few
in
number
but
a
series
of
forts

these
were
mere
perched
on
the
summit
of
some
eminence
and
surrounded
by
a
strip
of

the

not

the

have
inherited
the
royal
domain
just
as
they
found
it
at
the
close
of
the
xivth
dynasty
but
doubtless
the
whole
delta
from
avaris
to
sais
and
from
memphis
to
buto
was
their
personal
appanage
their

authority
probably
extended

than
the

and
their
supremacy
over

fiefs
of

at

precarious
the
turbulent
lords
who
shared
among
them
the
possession
of
the
valley
had
never
lost
their
proud
or
rebellious
spirit
and
under

under
the

their
obedience
to

the

displayed

by
their

lost

ascendency
which
it

over

dynasty
and
the
arrival
of

relegating

unceremoniously
to
a
second
rank

not
discouraged
it
or
lowered
its
royal
prestige
in

eyes
or
in
those
of

the

around

citadel
and
their
resources
combined
with
its
own

it
as
formidable
a
power
as
that
of
the
masters
of
the
delta
if
we
had
fuller
information
as
to
the
history
of
this
period
we
should
doubtless
see
that
the
various
theban
princes
took
occasion
as
in
the
heracleopolitan
epoch
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
their
sovereign
lord
and
did
not
allow
themselves
to
be
discouraged
by
any
check
the
length
of
time
during
which
egypt
was
subject
to
asiatic
rule
is
not
fully
known
historians
are
agreed
in
recognizing
the
three
epochs
referred
to
in
the
narrative
of
manetho
as
corresponding
with
the
conquest
and
the
six
first
hyksôs
kings
including
the
xvth
theban
dynasty
the
complete
submission
of
egypt
to
the
xvith
foreign
dynasty
the
war
of
independence
during
the
xviith
dynasty
which
consisted
of
two
parallel
series
of
kings
the
one
shepherds
pharaohs
the
other
thebans
there
has
been
considerable
discussion
as
to
the
duration
of
the
oppression
the
best
solution
is
still
that
given
by
erman
according
to
whom
the
xvth
dynasty
lasted
the
xvith
and
the
xviith
years
or
in
all
years
the
invasion
must
therefore
have
taken
place
about
or
about
the
time
when
the
elamite
power
was
at
its
highest
the
advent
of
the
xvith
dynasty
would
fall
about
and
the
commencement
of
the
war
of
independence
between
and
the
period
of
hegemony
attributed
by
the
chronicles
to
the
hyksôs
of
the
xvith
dynasty
was
not
probably
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
years
of
perfect
tranquillity
or
of
undisputed
authority
in
inscribing
their
sole
names
on
the
lists
the
compilers
denoted
merely
the
shorter
or
longer
period
during
which
their
theban
vassals
failed
in
their
rebellious
efforts
and
did
not
dare
to
assume
openly
the
title
or
ensigns
of
royalty
a
certain
apôphis
probably
the
same
who
took
the
prsenomen
of
aqnûnrî
was
reigning
at
tanis
when
the
decisive
revolt
broke
out
and
saqnûnrî
tiûâa
who
was
the
leader
on
the
occasion
had
no
other
title
of
authority
over
the
provinces
of
the
south
than
that
of
or
regent
we
are
unacquainted
with
the
cause
of
the
outbreak
or
with
its
sequel
and
the
egyptians
themselves
seem
to
have
been
not
much
better
informed
on
the
subject
than
ourselves
they
gave
free
flight
to
their
fancy
and
accommodated
the
details
to
their
taste
not
shrinking
from
the
introduction
of
daring
fictions
into
the
account
a
romance
which
was
very
popular
with
the
literati
four
or
five
hundred
years
later
asserted
that
the
real
cause
of
the
war
was
a
kind
of
religious
quarrel
happened
that
the
land
of
egypt
belonged
to
the
and
as
there
was
no
supreme
king
at
that
time
it
happened
then
that
king
saqnûnrî
was
regent
of
the
city
of
the
south
and
that
the
of
the
city
of
râ
were
under
the
rule
of
in
avaris
the
whole
land
tribute
to
the
latter
in
manufactured
products
and
the
north
did
the
same
in
all
the
good
things
of
the
delta
now
the
king
took
to
himself
sûtkhû
for
lord
and
he
did
not
serve
any
other
god
in
the
whole
land
except
sûtkhû
and
he
built
a
temple
of
excellent
and
everlasting
work
at
the
gate
of
the
king
and
he
arose
every
morning
to
sacrifice
the
daily
victims
and
the
chief
vassals
were
there
with
garlands
of
flowers
as
it
was
accustomed
to
be
done
for
the
temple
of
having
finished
the
temple
he
thought
of
imposing
upon
the
thebans
the
cult
of
his
god
but
as
he
shrank
from
employing
force
in
such
a
delicate
matter
he
had
recourse
to
stratagem
he
took
counsel
with
his
princes
and
generals
but
they
were
unable
to
propose
any
plan
the
college
of
diviners
and
scribes
was
more
complaisant
a
messenger
go
to
the
regent
of
the
city
of
the
south
to
tell
him
the
king
commands
thee
the
hippopotami
which
are
in
the
pool
of
the
town
are
to
be
exterminated
in
the
pool
in
order
that
slumber
may
come
to
me
by
day
and
by
he
will
not
be
able
to
reply
good
or
bad
and
thou
shalt
send
him
another
messenger
the
king
commands
thee
the
chief
of
the
south
does
not
reply
to
my
message
let
him
serve
no
longer
any
god
but
sûtkhû
but
if
he
replies
to
it
and
will
do
that
which
i
tell
him
to
do
then
i
will
impose
nothing
further
upon
him
and
i
will
not
in
future
bow
before
any
other
god
of
the
whole
land
than
amonrâ
king
of
the
gods
another
pharaoh
of
popular
romance
nectanebo
possessed
at
a
much
later
date
mares
which
conceived
at
the
neighing
of
the
stallions
of
babylon
and
his
friend
lycerus
had
a
cat
which
went
forth
every
night
to
wring
the
necks
of
the
cocks
of
memphis
the
hippopotami
of
the
theban
lake
which
troubled
the
rest
of
the
king
of
tanis
were
evidently
of
close
kin
to
these
extraordinary
animals
found
in
a
popular
story
which
came
in
later
times
to
be
associated
with
the
traditions
connected
with
æsop
the
sequel
is
unfortunately
lost
we
may
assume
however
without
much
risk
of
error
that
saqnûnrî
came
forth
safe
and
sound
from
the
ordeal
that
apôpi
was
taken
in
his
own
trap
and
saw
himself
driven
to
the
dire
extremity
of
giving
up
sûtkhû
for
amonrâ
or
of
declaring
war
he
was
likely
to
adopt
the
latter
alternative
and
the
end
of
the
manuscript
would
probably
have
related
his
defeat

and
misery
are
few
in
number

it
is
a
fortunate
circumstance
if
some
insignificant
object
tarns
up
which
would
elsewhere
be
passed
over
as
unworthy
of
notice
one
of
the
officials
of
tiûâa
has
left
us
his
writing
palette
on
which
the
cartouches
of
his
master
are
incised
with
a
rudeness
baffling
description
we
have
also
information
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
a
son
tûaû
who
accompanied
this
same
pharaoh
in
his
expeditions

the
gîzeh

proud
of
having
in
its
possession
the
i
wooden

this

placed
on

mummy
of

aqhorû

to

pyramid
on
the
border
of

at
his
death
the
series
of
rulers
was
broken

are

to
classify
sakhontinibrî
hotpûrî
manhotpûrî
eâhotpû
hotpûrî

mentioned
in

during

xxth

of
which
are
found
in
most
european
museums

of
these
fragments
preserved
in
the
louvre

is
made
of
tomb
certainly
situated
at

scarabs
of
this
king

he
executed
in
the

the
xivth
year

in
a
passage
of
the
story
as
being
the
date
of
the
death
of

born
under

these
two
kings
belong
as
far
as
we
are
able
to
judge
to
the
middle
of
the
xviith
dynasty
i
am
inclined
to
place
beside
them
the
pharaoh
nûbhotpûrî
of
whom
we
possess
a
few
rather
coarse
scarabs

we
proceed

becomes
more
plentiful

reigns

part
which
the
princesses
of
older
times
played
in
the
transmission
of
power
had
from
the
xiith
dynasty
downward
considerably
increased
in
importance
and
threatened
to
overshadow
that
of
the
princes
the
question
presents
itself
whether
during
these
centuries
of
perpetual
warfare
there
had
not
been
a
moment
when
all
the
males
of
the
family
having
perished
the
women
alone
were
left
to
perpetuate
the
solar
race
on
the
earth
and
to
keep
the
succession
unbroken
as
soon
as
the
veil
over
this
period
of
history
begins
to
be
lifted
we
distinguish
among
the
personages
emerging
from
the
obscurity
as
many
queens
as
kings
presiding
over
the
destinies
of
egypt
the
sons
took
precedence
of
the
daughters
when
both
were
the
offspring
of
a
brother
and
sister
born
of
the
same
parents
and
when
consequently
they
were
of
equal
rank
but
on
the
other
hand
the
sons
forfeited
this
equality
when
there
was
any
inferiority
in
origin
on
the
maternal
side
and
their
prospect
of
succession
to
the
throne
diminished
in
proportion
to
their
remoteness
from
the
line
of
râ
in
the
latter
case
all
their
sisters
born
of
marriages
which
to
us
appear
incestuous
took
precedence
of
them
and
the
eldest
daughter
became
the
legitimate
pharaoh
who
sat
in
the
seat
of
horus
on
the
death
of
her
father
or
even
occasionally
during
his
lifetime
the
prince
whom
she
married
governed
for
her
and
discharged
those
royal
duties
which
could
be
legally
performed
by
a
man
only
such
as
offering
worship
to
the
supreme
gods
commanding
the
army
and
administering
justice
but
his
wife
never
ceased
to
be
sovereign
and
however
small
the
intelligence
or
firmness
of
which
she
might
be
possessed
her
husband
was
obliged
to
leave
to
her
at
all
events
on
certain
occasions
the
direction
of
affairs

ahmosisa
must
have
been
about
years
of

ascended

was

likeness
alone
would
proclaim
the
affinity
even
if
we
were
ignorant
of
the
close
relationship
which
united
these
two
pharaohs
ahmosis
seems
to
have
been
a
strong
active
warlike
man
he
was
successful
in
all
the
wars
in
which
we
know
him
to
have
been
engaged
and
he
ousted
the
shepherds
from
the
last
towns
occupied
by
them
it
is
possible
that
modern
writers
have
exaggerated
the
credit
due
to
ahmosis
for
expelling
the
hyksôs
he
found
the
task
already
half
accomplished
and
the
warfare
of
his
forefathers
for
at
least
a
century
must
have
prepared
the
way
for
his
success
if
he
appears
to
have
played
the
most
important
in
the
history
of
the
deliverance
it
is
owing
to
our
ignorance
of
the
work
of
others
and
he
thus
benefits
by
the
oblivion
into
which
their
deeds
have
passed
taking
this
into
consideration
we
must
still
admit
that
the
shepherds
even
when
driven
into
avaris
were
not
adversaries
to
be
despised
forced
by
the
continual
pressure
of
the
egyptian
armies
into
this
corner
of
the
delta
they
were
as
a
compact
body
the
more
able
to
make
a
protracted
resistance
against
very
superior
forces
here
again
my
description
is
taken
from
the
present
appearance
of
the
mummy
which
is
now
in
the
gîzeh
museum
it
is
evident
from
the
inspection
which
i
have
made
that
ahmosis
was
about
fifty
years
old
at
the
time
of
his
death
and
allowing
him
to
have
reigned
years
he
must
have
been
or
when
he
came

is
therefore
not
without

that

we
are

of

there
were
no

even

we

have

observe
the

broke
out
on
the
accession
of
ahmosis
and
continued
during
the
first
five
years
of
his
reign
one
of
his
lieutenants
the
namesake
who
belonged
to
the
family
of
the
lords
of
nekhabît
has
left
us
an
account
in
one
of
the
inscriptions
in
his
tomb
of
the
numerous
exploits
in
which
he
took
part
side
by
side
with
his
royal
master
and
thus
thanks
to
this
fortunate
record
of
his
vanity
we
are
not
left
in
complete
ignorance
of
the
events
which
took
place
during
this
crucial
struggle
between
the
asiatic
settlers
and
their
former
subjects
nekhabît
had
enjoyed
considerable
prosperity
in
the
earlier
ages
of
egyptian
history
marking
as
it
did
the
extreme
southern
limit
of
the
kingdom
and
forming
an
outpost
against
the
barbarous
tribes
of
nubia
as
soon
as
the
progress
of
conquest
had
pushed
the
frontier
as
far
south
as
the
first
cataract
it
declined
in
importance
and
the
remembrance
of
its
former
greatness
found
an
echo
only
in
proverbial
expressions
or
in
titles
used
at
the
pharaonic
court
the
nomes
situated
to
the
south
of
thebes
unlike
those
of
middle
egypt
did
not
comprise
any
extensive
fertile
or
territory
calculated
to
enrich
its
possessors
or
to
afford
sufficient
support
for
a
large
population
they
consisted
of
long
strips
of
alluvial
soil
shut
in
between
the
river
and
the
mountain
range
but
above
the
level
of
the
inundation
and
consequently
difficult
to
irrigate
this
is
evident
from
passage
in
the
biography
of
where
it
is
stated
that
after
the
taking
of
avaris
the
king
passed
into
asia
in
the
year

the
first
few
lines
of
the
inscription

to
refer
to
four
successive
campaigns

years
of
warfare
up
to
the
taking
of
avaris
and
to
a
fifth
year
spent
in
pursuing
the
shepherds

syria
the
vulture
of
nekhabît
is
used
to
indicate
the
south
while
the
urseus
of
buto
denotes
the
extreme
north
the
title
of
nekhnît
which
is
hypothetically
supposed
to
refer
to
a
judicial
function
is
none
the
less
associated
with
the
expression
tekhnît
as
an
indication
of
the
south
and
therefore
can
be
traced
to
the
prehistoric
epoch
when
nekhabît
was
the
primary
designation
of

a

which
would
bring
into

such
as
those
of

the

would
naturally
centre

which
would

of

the

of

led
an
obscure
existence
during
the
whole

of
the
memphite

his
son
ahmosi
having
approached
the
end
of
his
career
cut
a
tomb
for
himself
in
the
hill
which
overlooks
the
northern
side
of
the
town
he
relates
on
the
walls
of
his
sepulchre
for
the
benefit
of
posterity
the
most
praiseworthy
actions
of
his
long
life
he
had
scarcely
emerged
from
childhood
when
he
was
called
upon
to
act
for
his
father
and
before
his
marriage
he
was
appointed
to
the
command
of
the
barque
from
thence
he
was
promoted
to
the
ship
and
on
account
of
his
activity
he
was
chosen
to
escort
his
namesake
the
king
on
foot
whenever
he
drove
in
his
chariot
he
repaired
to
his
post
at
the
moment
when
the
decisive
war
against
the
hyksôs
broke
out
there
are
still
some
doubts
as
to
the
descent
of
this
ahmosi
some
authorities
hold
that
babai
was
the
name
of
his
father
and
abîna
that
of
his
grandfather
others
think
that
babai
was
his
father
and
abîna
his
mother
others
again
make
out
babai
and
abîna
to
be
variants
of
the
same
name
probably
a
semitic
one
borne
by
the
father
of
ahmosi
the
majority
of
modern
egyptologists
including
myself
regard
this
last
hypothesis
as
being
the
most
probable
one
the
tradition
current
in
the
time
of
the
ptolemies
reckoned
the
number
of
men
under
the
command
of
king
ahmosis
when
he
encamped
before
avaris
at
this
immense
multitude
failed
to
bring
matters
to
a
successful
issue
and
the
siege
dragged
on
indefinitely
the
king
afc
length
preferred
to
treat
with
the
shepherds
and
gave
them
permission
to
retreat
into
syria
safe
and
sound
together
with
their
wives
their
children
and
all
their
goods
this
account
however
in
no
way
agrees
with
the
all
too
brief
narration
of
events
furnished
by
the
inscription
in
the
tomb
the
army
to
which
egypt
really
owed
its
deliverance
was
not
the
undisciplined
rabble
of
later
tradition
but
on
the
contrary
consisted
of
troops
similar
to
those
which
subsequently
invaded
syria
some
to
in
number
fully
equipped
and
ably
officered
supported
moreover
by
a
fleet
ready
to
transfer
them
across
the
canals
and
arms
of
the
river
in
a
vigorous
condition
and
ready
for
the
battle
it
may
be
pointed
out
that
ahmosi
son
of
abîna
was
a
sailor
and
a
leader
of
sailors
that
he
passed
from
one
vessel
to
another
until
he
was
at
length
appointed
to
the
command
of

of
the
most
important
ships

elsewhere
drawn
attention
to
campaigns
conducted
in
this
manner
under
the
horacleopolitan
dynasties
and
we
shall
see
that
the
ethiopian
conquerors
adopted
the
same
mode
of
transit
in
the
course
of
their
invasion
of
egypt
as
soon
as
this
fleet
arrived
at
the
scene
of
hostilities
the
engagement
began
conducted
the
manouvres
under
the
eye
and
soon
gave
such
evidence
of
his
capacity
that
he
was
transferred
by
royal
favour

the

a
vessel
with
a
high
freeboard

was
shortly
afterwards
appointed

post

division

off
for
duty
on
the
river

which
ran
under
the
walls
of

fortress
two
successive
and
vigorous
attacks
made
in
this
quarter
were
barren
of
important
results
succeeded
in
each
of
the
attacks
in
killing
an
enemy
bringing
back
as
trophies
a
hand
of
each
of
his
victims
and
his
prowess
made
known
to
the
king
by
one
of
the
heralds
twice
procured
for
him
gold
of
valour
probably
in
the
form
of
collars
chains
or
bracelets

of

recognised

which
had

the

condition
on

the
three
monuments
which
have
come
down
to
us
are
sufficiently
complementary
to
one
another
to
enable
us
to
restore
nearly
the
whole
of
the
original
text
the
expedition
having
accomplished
its
purpose
the
egyptians
returned
home
with
their
spoil
and
did
not
revisit
asia
for
a
long
period
if
the
hyksôs
generals
had
fostered
in
their
minds
the
idea
that
they
could
recover
their
lost
ground
and
easily
upon
the
possession
of
their
african
domain
this
reverse
must
have
cruelly
disillusioned
them
they
must
have
been
forced
to
acknowledge
that
their
power
was
at
an
end
and
to
renounce
all
hope
of
returning
to
the
country
which
had
so
summarily
ejected
them
the
majority
of
their
own
people
did
not
follow
them
into
exile
but
remained
attached
to
the
soil
on
which
they
lived
and
the
tribes
which
had
successively
settled
down
beside
them
including
the
themselves
no
longer
dreamed
of
a
return
to
their
fatherland
the
condition
of
these
people
varied
according
to
their
locality
those
who
had
taken
up
a
position
in
the
plain
of
the
delta
were
subjected
to
actual
slavery
ahmosis
destroyed
the
camp
at
avails
quartered
his
officers
in
the
towns
and
constructed
forts
at
strategic
points
or
rebuilt
the
ancient
citadels
to
resist
the
incursions
of
the
bedouin
the
vanquished
people
in
the
delta
hemmed
in
as
they
were
by
a
network
of
fortresses
were
thus
reduced
to
a
rabble
of
serfs
to
be
taxed
and
subjected
to
the
without
mercy
but
further
north
the
fluctuating
population
which
roamed
between
the
sebennytic
and
pelusiac
branches
of
the
nile
were
not
exposed
to
such
rough
treatment
the
marshes
of
the
afforded
them
a
safe
retreat
in
which
they
could
take
refuge
at
the
first
threat
of
exactions
on
the
part
of
the
royal
emissaries
secure
within
dense
thickets
upon
islands
approached
by
interminable
causeways
often
covered
with
water
or
by
long
tortuous
canals
concealed
in
the
thick
growth
of
reeds
they
were
able
to
defy
with
impunity
the
efforts
of
the
most
disciplined
troops
and
treason
alone
could
put
them
at
the
mercy
of
their
foes
most
of
the
pharaohs
felt
that
the
advantages
to
be
gained
by
conquering
them
would
be
outweighed
by
the
difficulty
of
the
enterprise
all
that
could
result
from
a
campaign
would
be
the
destruction
of
one
or
two
villages
the
acquisition
of
a
few
hundred
refractory
captives
of
some
cattle
and
a
trophy
of
nets
and
boats
the
kings
therefore
preferred
to
keep
a
close
watch
over
these
undisciplined
hordes
and
as
long
as
their
depredations
were
kept
within
reasonable
limits
they
were
left
unmolested
to
their
wild
and
precarious
life
the
asiatic
invasion
had
put
a
sudden
stop
to
the
advance
of
egyptian
rule
in
the
vast
plains
of
the
upper
nile
the
theban
princes
to
whom
nubia
was
directly
subject
had
been
too
completely
engrossed
in
the
wars
against
their
hereditary
enemy
to
devote
much
time
to
the
continuation
of
that
work
of
colonization
in
the
south
which
had
been
carried
on
so
vigorously
by
their
forefathers
of
the
xiith
and
xiiith
dynasties
the
inhabitants
of
the
nile
valley
as
far
as
the
second
cataract
rendered
them
obedience
but
without
any
change
in
the
conditions
and
mode
of
their
daily
life
which
appear
to
have
remained
unaltered
for
centuries
the
temples
of
usirtasen
and
amenemhaît
were
allowed
to
fall
into
decay
one
after
another
the
towns
waned
in
prosperity
and
were
unable
to
keep
their
buildings
and
monuments
in
repair
the
inundation
continued
to
bring
with
it
periodically
its
fleet
of
boats
which
the
sailors
of
kûsh
had
laden
with
timber
gum
tusks
and
gold
dust
from
time
to
time
a
band
of
bedouin
from
uaûaît
or
mazaiû
would
suddenly
bear
down
upon
some
village
and
carry
off
its
spoils
the
nearest
garrison
would
be
called
to
its
aid
or
on
critical
occasions
the
king
himself
at
the
head
of
his
guards
would
fall
on
the
marauders
and
drive
them
back
into
the
mountains
ahrnosis
being
greeted
on
his
return
from
syria
by
the
news
of
such
an
outbreak
thought
it
a
favourable
moment
to
impress
upon
the
nomadic
tribes
of
nubia
the
greatness
of
his
conquest
on
this
occasion
it
was
the
people
of
khonthanûnofir
settled
in
the
wadys
east
of
the
nile
above
semneh
which
required
a
lesson
the
army
which
had
just
expelled
the
hyksôs
was
rapidly
conveyed
to
the
opposite
borders
of
the
country
by
the
fleet
the
two
ahmosi
of
nekhabît
occupying
the
highest
posts
the
egyptians
as
was
customary
landed
at
the
nearest
point
to
the
territory
and
succeeded
in
killing
a
few
of
the
rebels
brought
back
two
prisoners
and
three
hands
for
which
he
was
rewarded
by
a
gift
of
two
female
bedouin
slaves
besides
the
of
this
victory
in
the
south
following
on
such
decisive
success
in
the
north
filled
the
heart
of
the
pharaoh
with
pride
and
the
view
taken
of
it
by
those
who
surrounded
him
is
evident
even
in
the
brief
sentences
of
the
narrative
he
is
described
as
descending
the
river
on
the
royal
galley
elated
in
spirit
and
flushed
by
his
triumph
in
nubia
which
had
followed
so
closely
on
the
deliverance
of
the
delta
but
scarcely
had
he
reached
thebes
when
an
unforeseen
catastrophe
turned
his
confidence
into
alarm
and
compelled
him
to
retrace
his
steps
it
would
appear
that
at
the
very
moment
when
he
was
priding
himself
on
the
successful
issue
of
his
ethiopian
expedition
one
of
the
sudden
outbreaks
which
frequently
occurred
in
those
regions
had
culminated
in
a
sudanese
invasion
of
egypt
we
are
not
told
the
name
of
the
rebel
leader
nor
those
of
the
tribes
who
took
part
in
it
the
egyptian
people
threatened
in
a
moment
of
such
apparent
security
by
this
inroad
of
barbarians
regarded
them
as
a
fresh
incursion
of
the
hyksôs
and
applied
to
these
southerners
the
opprobrious
term
of
already
used
to
denote
their
asiatic
conquerors
the
enemy
descended
the
nile
committing
terrible
atrocities
and
polluting
every
sanctuary
of
the
theban
gods
which
came
within
their
reach
they
had
reached
a
spot
called
tentoâ
before
they
fell
in
with
the
egyptian
troops
again
distinguished
himself
in
the
engagement
the
vessel
which
he
commanded
probably
the
in
ran
alongside
the
chief
galliot
of
the
sudanese
fleet
and
took
possession
of
it
after
a
struggle
in
which
ahmosi
made
two
of
the
sailors
prisoners
with
his
own
hand
the
king
generously
rewarded
those
whose
valour
had
thus
turned
the
day
in
his
favour
for
the
danger
had
appeared
to
him
critical
he
allotted
to
every
man
on
board
the
victorious
vessel
five
slaves
and
five
ancra
of
land
situated
in
his
native
province
of
each
respectively
the
invasion
was
not
without
its
natural
consequences
to
egypt
itself
the
name
of
this
locality
does
not
occur
elsewhere
it
would
seem
to
refer
not
to
a
village
but
rather
to
a
canal
or
the
branch
of
a
river
or
a
harbour
somewhere
along
the
nile
i
am
unable
to
locate
it
definitely
but
am
inclined
to
think
we
ought
to
look
for
it
if
not
in
egypt
itself
at
any
rate
in
that
part
of
nubia
which
is
nearest
to
egypt
revillout
taking
up
a
theory
which
had
been
abandoned
by
chabas
recognising
in
this
expedition
an
offensive
incursion
of
the
shepherds
suggests
that
tantoâ
may
be
the
modern
tantah
in
the
delta
a
certain
titiânu
who
appears
to
have
been
at
the
head
of
a
powerful
faction
rose
in
rebellion
at
some
place
not
named
in
the
narrative
but
in
the
rear
of
the
army
the
rapidity
with
which
ahmosis
repulsed
the
nubians
and
turned
upon
his
new
enemy
completely
baffled
the
plans
and
he
and
his
followers
were
cut
to
pieces
but
the
danger
had
for
the
moment
been
serious
it
was
if
not
the
last
expedition
undertaken
in
this
reign
at
least
the
last
commanded
by
the
pharaoh
in
person
by
his
activity
and
courage
ahmosis
had
well
earned
the
right
to
pass
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
peace
the
wording
of
the
text
is
so
much
condensed
that
it
is
difficult
to
be
sure
of
its
moaning
modern
scholars
agree
with
brugsch
that
titiânu
is
the
name
of
a
man
but
several
egyptologists
believe
its
bearer
to
have
been
chief
of
the
ethiopian
tribes
while
others
think
him
to
have
been
a
rebellious
egyptian
prince
or
a
king
of
the
shepherds
or
give
up
the
task
of
identification
in
despair
the
tortuous
wording
of
the
text
and
the
expressions
which
occur
in
it
seem
to
indicate
that
the
rebel
was
a
prince
of
the
royal
blood
and
even
that
the
name
he
bears
was
not
his
real
one
later
on
we
shall
find
that
on
a
similar
occasion
the
official
documents
refer
to
a
prince
who
took
part
in
a
plot
against
ramses
iii
by
the
fictitious
name
of
pentauîrît
titiânu
was
probably
a
nickname
of
the
same
kind
inserted
in
place
of
the
real
name
it
seems
that
in
cases
of
high
treason
the
criminal
not
only
lost
his
life
but
his
name
was
proscribed
both
in
this
world
and
in
the
next
a
revival
of
military
greatness
always
entailed
a
renaissance
in
art
followed
by
an
age
of
building
activity
the
claims
of
the
gods
upon
the
spoils
of
war
must
be
satisfied
before
those
of
men
because
the
victory
and
the
booty
obtained
through
it
were
alike
owing
to
the
divine
help
given
in
battle
a
tenth
therefore
of
the
slaves
cattle
and
precious
metals
was
set
apart
for
the
service
of
the
gods
and
even
fields
towns
and
provinces
were
allotted
to
them
the
produce
of
which
was
applied
to
enhance
the
importance
of
their
cult

to
repair
and
enlarge
their
temples
the

never
completely
lost
the
technical
knowledge
of
their
calling

the
ancient

furnished
them
with
various
types
of
models
which
they
had
but
to
copy
faithfully
in

to
revive
their
old
traditions
a
few
years
after
this
revival
a
new
school
sprang
up
whose
originality
became
daily
more
patent
and
whose
leaders
soon
showed
themselves
to
be
in
no
way
inferior
to
the
masters
of
the
older
schools
ahmosis
could
not
be
accused
of
ingratitude
to
the
gods
as
soon
as
his
wars
allowed
him
the
necessary
leisure
he
began
his
work
of
the
accession
to

of
the
great
theban
families

been
of
little
advantage
to

its
pharaohs

the
sovereignty
of
the
whole

not

to
abandon
their

only
returning

the
decadence

power
had
set
in
the
honour
of
furnishing
rulers

often
devolved
on

the

reaped

little
benefit
from
the
fact
this

however
the
tide

was
to
be
turned
the

showed
themselves
to

ahmosis
could
not
be
accused
of
ingratitude
to
the
gods
as
soon
as
his
wars
allowed
him
the
necessary
leisure
he
began
his
work
of
the
accession
to
power
of
the
great
theban
families
had
been
of
little
advantage
to
thebes
itself
its
pharaohs
on
assuming
the
sovereignty
of
the
whole
valley
had
not
hesitated
to
abandon
their
native
city
and
had
made
heracleopolis
the
fayum
or
even
memphis
their
seat
of
government
only
returning
to
thebes
in
the
time
of
the
xiiith
dynasty
when
the
decadence
of
their
power
had
set
in
the
honour
of
furnishing
rulers
for
its
country
had
often
devolved
on
thebes
but
the
city
had
reaped
but
little
benefit
from
the
fact
this
time
however
the
tide
of
fortune
was
to
be
turned
illustration
painting
in
tomb
of
the
kings
thebes
the
other
cities
of
egypt
had
come
to
regard
thebes
as
their
metropolis
from
the
time
when
they
had
learned
to
rally
round
its
princes
to
wage
war
against
the
hyksôs
it
had
been
the
last
town
to
lay
down
arms
at
the
time
of
the
invasion
and
the
first
to
take
them
up
again
in
the
struggle
for
liberty
thus
the
egypt
which
vindicated
her
position
among
the
nations
of
the
world
was
not
the
egypt
of
the
memphite
dynasties
it
was
the
great
egypt
of
the
amenemhâîts
and
the
usirtasens
still
further
aggrandised
by
recent
victories
thebes
was
her
natural
capital
and
its
kings
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
suitable
position
from
whence
to
command
effectually
the
whole
empire
situated
at
an
equal
distance
from
both
frontiers
the
pharaoh
residing
there
on
the
outbreak
of
a
war
either
in
the
north
or
south
had
but
half
the
length
of
the
country
to
traverse
in
order
to
reach
the
scene
of
action
ahmosis
spared
no
pains
to
improve
the
city
but
his
resources
did
not
allow
of
his
embarking
on
any
very
extensive
schemes
he
did
not
touch
the
temple
of
amon
and
if
he
undertook
any
buildings
in
its
neighbourhood
they
must
have
been
minor
edifices
he
could
indeed
have
had
but
little
leisure
to
attempt
much
else
for
it
was
not
till
the
xxiind
year
of
his
reign
that
he
was
able
to
set
seriously
to
work
in
the
inscription
of
the
year
âhmosis
expressly
states
that
he
opened
new
chambers
in
the
quarries
of
tûrah
for
the
works
in
connection
with
the
theban
amon
as
well
as
for
those
of
the
temple
of
the
memphite
phtah
an
opportunity
then
occurred
to
revive
a
practice
long
fallen
into
disuse
under
the
foreign
kings
and
to
set
once
more
in
motion
an
essential
part
of
the
machinery
of
egyptian
administration
the
quarries
of
turah
as
is
well
known
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
furnishing
the
finest
materials
to
the
royal
architects
nowhere
else
could
be
found
limestone
of
such
whiteness
so
easy
to
cut
or
so
calculated
to
lend
itself
to
the
carving
of
delicate
inscriptions
and
the
commoner
veins
had
never
ceased
to
be
worked
by
private
enterprise
gangs
of
quarrymen
being
always
employed
as
at
the
present
day
in
cutting
small
stone
for
building
purposes
or
in
ruthlessly
chipping
it
to
pieces
to
burn
for
lime
in
the
kilns
of
the
neighbouring
villages
but
the
finest
veins
were
always
kept
for
state
purposes
contemporary
chroniclers
might
have
formed
a
very
just
estimate
of
national
prosperity
by
the
degree
of
activity
shown
in
working
these
royal
preserves
when
the
amount
of
stone
extracted
was
lessened
prosperity
was
on
the
wane
and
might
be
pronounced
to
be
at
its
lowest
ebb
when
the
noise
of
the
hammer
finally
ceased
to
be
heard

the

the
precise
site
is
at

we
see
however
that
it
was
in
this
place
when
wo
observe
that
ahmosis
was
worshipped
by
the
servants
of
the
necropolis
amongst
the
kings
and
princes
of
his
family
who
were
buried
at
his
priests
and
the

of
his
cult
are
mentioned
on
a
stele
in
the
museum
at
turin

on
a

is

as
a
god
along
with
osiris

isis
on
a
stele

the
lyons

from

had
probably
during
one
of
his
journeys
across

made
a
donation
to
the
temple
of
that
city

that
he
should

him

us
that
pharaoh
thûtmosis
iv
several
times
sent
one
of
his
messengers
to

for
the
purpose
of
presenting

to

of

of
one
of
those
enormous
caryatides
which
we
sometimes
find
adorning
the
front
of
a
temple
we
may
perhaps
attribute
to
the
influence
of
nofrîtari
the
lack
of
zest
evinced
by
amenôthes
for
expeditions
into
syria
even
the
most
energetic
kings
had
always
shrunk
from
penetrating
much
beyond
the
isthmus
those
who
ventured
so
far
as
to
work
the
mines
of
sinai
had
nevertheless
felt
a
secret
fear
of
invading
asia
proper
a
dread
which
they
never
succeeded
in
overcoming
when
the
raids
of
the
bedouin
obliged
the
egyptian
sovereign
to
cross
the
frontier
into
their
territory
he
would
retire
as
soon
as
possible
without
attempting
any
permanent
conquest
after
the
expulsion
of
the
hyksôs
ahmosis
seemed
inclined
to
pursue
a
less
timorous
course
he
made
an
advance
on
sharûhana
and
pillaged
it
and
the
booty
he
brought
back
ought
to
have
encouraged
him
to
attempt
more
important
expeditions
but
he
never
returned
to
this
region
and
it
would
seem
that
when
his
first
enthusiasm
had
subsided
he
was
paralysed
by
the
same
fear
which
had
fallen
on
his
ancestors
nofrîtari
may
have
counselled
her
son
not
to
break
through
the
traditions
which
his
father
had
so
strictly
followed
for
amenôthes
confined
his
campaigns
to
africa
and
the
traditional
there
he
embarked
for
the
land
of
kûsh
on
the
vessel
of
the
purpose
of
enlarging
the
frontiers
of
it
was
we
may
believe
a
thoroughly
conventional
campaign
conducted
according
to
the
strictest
precedents
of
the
xiith
dynasty
the
pharaoh
as
might
be
expected
came
into
personal
contact
with
the
enemy
and
slew
their
chief
with
his
own
hand
the
barbarian
warriors
sold
their
lives
dearly
but
were
unable
to
protect
their
country
from
pillage
the
victors
carrying
off
whatever
they
could
seize
men
women
and
cattle
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
had
led
the
army
some
distance
into
the
desert
as
far
as
a
called
the
instead
of
retracing
his
steps
to
the
nile
squadron
and
returning
slowly
by
boat
amenôthes
resolved
to
take
a
short
cut
homewards
ahmosi
conducted
him
back
overland
in
two
days
and
was
rewarded
for
his
speed
by
the
gift
of
a
quantity
of
gold
and
two
female
slaves
an
incursion
into
libya
followed
quickly
on
the
ethiopian
campaign

the
tribe
of
the
kihaka
settled
between
lake
mareotis
and
the
oasis
of
amon
had
probably
attacked
in
an
audacious
manner
the
western
provinces
of
the
delta
a
raid
was
organized
against
them
and
the
issue
was
commemorated
by
a
small
wooden
stele
on
which
we
see
the
victor
represented
as
brandishing
his
sword
over
a
barbarian
lying
prostrate
at
his
feet
the
exploits
of
amenôthes
appear
to
have
ended
with
this
raid
for
we
possess
no
monument
recording
any
further
victory
gained
by
him
this
however
has
not
prevented
his
contemporaries
from
celebrating
him
as
a
conquering
and
king
he
is
portrayed
standing
erect
in
his
chariot
ready
to
charge
or
as
carrying
off
two
barbarians
whom
he
holds
half
suffocated
in
his
sinewy
arms
or
as
gleefully
smiting
the
princes
of
foreign
lands
he
acquitted
himself
of
the
duties
of
the
chase
as
became
a
true
pharaoh
for
we
find
him
depicted
in
the
act
of
seizing
a
lion
by
the
tail
and
raising
him
suddenly
in
previous
to
despatching
him
these
are
indeed
but
conventional
pictures
of
war
to
which
we
must
not
attach
an
undue
importance
egypt
had
need
of
repose
in
order
to
recover
from
the
losses
it
had
sustained
during
the
years
of
struggle
with
the
invaders
if
amenôthes
courted
peace
from
preference
and
not
from
political
motives
his
own
generation
profited
as
much
by
his
indolence
as
the
preceding
one
had
gained
by
the
energy
of
ahrnosis
the
towns
in
his
reign
resumed
their
ordinary
life
agriculture
flourished
and
commerce
again
followed
its
accustomed
routes
egypt
increased
its
resources
and
was
thus
able
to
prepare
for
future
conquest
the
taste
for
building
had
not
as
yet
sufficiently
developed
to
become
a
drain
upon
the
public
treasury
we
have
however
records
showing
that
amenôthes
excavated
a
cavern

the
mountain
of
ibrîm

to

the

concluded
from
this
fact
that
amenôthes
had
begun
extensive
works
for
enlarging
the
temple
of
amon

with
greater
probability
that
the
colossus
formerly
stood
at
the
entrance
to
the
xiith
dynasty
temple

was
removed
to
its
present
position
by
thûtmosis

metamorphosed

similarly
represented
as
osiris
the
protector
of
the
necropolis

depicted
as
such

the
sombre
colour
of
the
funerary
divinities

image
moreover
together
with
those
of
the
other
gods
was
used
to
decorate
the
interiors
of
coffins
and
to
protect
the
mummies
of
his
devotees
wiedemann
has
collected
several
examples
to
which
it
would
be
easy
to
add
others
the
names
of
the
king
are
in

so
little
removed
from

in

daughter
born

was
given
in

to
thûtmosis
one
of
her
brothers
the
son
of
a
mere
concubine
by
name
sonisonbû
ahmasi
like
her
ancestor
nofrîtari
had
therefore
the
right
to
exercise
all
the
royal
functions
and
she
might
have
claimed
precedence
of
her
husband
whether
from
conjugal
affection
or
from
weakness
of
character
she
yielded
however
the
priority
to
thûtmosis
and
allowed
him
to
assume
the
sole
government
ahhotpû
ii
may
be
seen
beside
her
husband
on
several
monuments
the
proof
that
she
was
full
sister
of
amenôthes
is
furnished
by
the
title
of
which
is

her
daughter
àhmasi
this
princess
would
not
have
taken
precedence
of
her
brother

husband
thûtmosis

was
the
son
of
an
inferior
wife
had
she
not
been
the
daughter
of
the
only
legitimate
spouse
of
amenôthes
i
the
marriage
had
already
taken
place
before
the
accession
of
thûtmosis
as
ahmasi
figures
in
a
document
dated
the
first
year
of
his
reign
the
absence
of
any
cartouche
shows
that
sonisonbû
did
not
belong
to
the
royal
family
and
the
very
form
of
the
name
points
her
out
to
have
been
of
the
middle
classes
and
merely
a
concubine
the
accession
of
her
son
however
ennobled
her
and
he
represents
her
as
a
queen
on
the
walls
of
the
temple
at
deîr
even
then
he
merely
styles
her
mother
the
only
title
she
could
really
claim
as
her
inferior
position
in

the

the
of

the

really
the
protocol
of
the
king
as
we
find
it
on
the
monuments
with
his
two
horus
names
and
his
solar
titles
the
copy
of
the
letter
which
has
come
down
to
us
is
addressed
to
the
commander
of
elephantine
hence
the
mention
of
the
gods
of
that
town
the
names
of
the
divinities
must
have
been
altered
to
suit
each
district
to
which
the
order
to
offer
sacrifices
for
the
prosperity
of
the
new
sovereign
was
sent
the
new
king
was
tall
in
stature
well
knit
and
capable
of
enduring
the
fatigues
of
war
without
flagging
his
statues
represent
him
as
having
a
full
round
face
long
nose
square
chin
rather
thick
lips
and
a
smiling
but
firm
expression
thûtmosis
brought
with
him
on
ascending
the
throne
the
spirit
of
the
younger
generation
who
born
shortly
after
the
deliverance
from
the
hyksôs
had
grown
up
in
the
peaceful
days
of
amenôthes
and
elated
by
the
easy
victories
obtained
over
the
nations
of
the
south
were
inspired
by
ambitions
unknown
to
the
egyptians
of
earlier
times
to
this
younger
race
africa
no
longer
offered
a
sufficiently
wide
or
attractive
field
the
whole
country
was
their
own
as
far
as
the
confluence
of
the
two
niles
and
the
theban
gods
were
worshipped
at
napata
no
less
devoutly
than
at
thebes
itself
what
remained
to
be
conquered
in
that
direction
was
scarcely
worth
the
trouble
of
reducing
to
a
province
or
of
annexing
as
a
colony
it
comprised
a
number
of
tribes
hopelessly
divided
among
themselves
and
consequently
in
spite
of
their
renowned
bravery
without
power
of
resistance
light
columns
of
troops
drafted
at
intervals
on
either
side
of
the
river
ensured
order
among
the
submissive
or
despoiled
the
refractory
of
their
possessions
in
cattle
slaves
and
precious
stones
thûtmosis
had
to
repress
however
very
shortly
after
his
accession
a
revolt
of
these
borderers
at
the
second
and
third
cataracts
but
they
were
easily
overcome
in
a
campaign
of
a
few
duration
in
which
the
two
âhmosis
of
took
an
honourable
part
there
was
as
usual
an
encounter
of
the
two
fleets
in
the
middle
of
the
river
the
young
king
himself
attacked
the
chief
pierced
him
with
his
first
arrow
and
made
a
considerable
number
of
prisoners
thûtmosis
had
the
corpse
of
the
chief
suspended
as
a
trophy
in
front
of
the
royal
ship
and
sailed
northwards
towards
thebes
where
however
he
was
not
destined
to
remain
long
an
ample
field
of
action
presented
itself
to
him
in
the
affording
scope
for
great
exploits
as
profitable
as
they
were
glorious
that
this
expedition
must
be
placed
at
the
beginning
of
the
reign
in

facts

by
maritime
trade
and
caravan
traffic
had
amassed

wealth
the
country
had
been
previously
subdued
by
the
chaldæans
who
still
exercised
an
undisputed
influence
over
it
and
it
was
but
natural
that
the
conquerors
of
the
hyksôs
should
act
in
their
turn
as
invaders
the
incursion
of
asiatics
into
egypt
thus
provoked
a
reaction
which
issued
in
an
egyptian
invasion
of
asiatic
soil
thûtmosis
and
his
contemporaries
had
inherited
none
of
the
instinctive
fear
of
penetrating
into
syria
which
influenced
ahmosis
and
his
successor
the
theban
legions
were
perhaps
slow
to
advance
but
once
they
had
trodden
the
roads
of
palestine
they
were
not
likely
to
forego
the
delights
of
conquest
from
that
time
forward
there
was
perpetual
warfare
and
pillaging
expeditions
from
the
plains
of
the
blue
nile
to
those
of
the
euphrates
so
that
scarcely
a
year
passed
without
bringing
to
the
city
of
amon
its
tribute
of
victories
and
riches
gained
at
the
point
of
the
sword
one
day
the
news
would
be
brought
that
the
amorites
or
the
khâti
had
taken
the
field
to
be
immediately
followed
by
the
announcement
that
their
forces
had
been
shattered

the
valour
of
the
egyptian

city
with
the
flower
of
his
generals
and
veterans
the
chiefs
whom
he
had
taken

sometimes
with
his
own
hand
would
be
conducted
through
the
streets
and
then
led
to
die
at
the
foot
of
the
altars
while
fantastic
processions
of
richly
clothed
captives
beasts
led
by
halters
and
slaves
bending
under
the
weight
of
the
spoil
would
stretch
in

endless

and

meanwhile
the
timihû
roused
by
some
unknown
cause
would
attack
the
outposts
stationed
on
the
frontier
or
news
would
come
that
the
peoples
of
the
sea
had
landed
on
the
western
side
of
the
delta
the
pharaoh
had
again
to
take
the
field
invariably
with
the
same
speedy
and
successful
issue
the
libyans
seemed
to
fare
no
better
than
the
syrians
and
before
long
those
who
had
survived
the
defeat
would
be
paraded
before
the
theban
citizens
previous
to
being
sent
to
join
the
asiatic
prisoners
in
the
mines
or
quarries
their
blue
eyes
and
fair
hair
showing
from
beneath
strangely
shaped
helmets
while
their
white
skins
tall
stature
and
tattooed
bodies
excited
for
a
few
hours
the
interest
and
mirth
of
the
idle
crowd
at
another
time
one
of
the
customary
raids
into
the
land
of
kûsh
would
take
place
consisting
of
a
rapid
march
across
the
sands
of
the
ethiopian
desert
and
a
cruise
along
the
coasts
of
pûanîfc
this
would
be
followed
by
another
triumphal
procession
in
which
fresh
elements
of
interest
would
appear
heralded
by
flourish
of
trumpets
and
roll
of
drums
pharaoh
would

shoulders
of

heavily
chained
or
coupled

such
a

it
was
impossible
for
them
to
move
without
grotesque
contortions
while
the
acclamations
of

without

still
afford
matter
for
discussion
amid
the
many
conflicting
opinions
it
behoves
us
to
remember
that
gulkishar
the
only
prince
of
this
dynasty
whose

we

calls
himself
of
the
country
of
the
that
is
to
say
of
the
marshy
country
at
the
mouth
of
the
euphrates
this
simple
fact
directs
us
to
seek
the
cradle
of
the
family
in
those
districts
of
southern
chaldæa
sayce
rejects
this
identification
on
philological
and
chronological
grounds
and
sees
in
gulkishar
of
the
a
vassal
kaldâ
prince
this
unexpected
revolution
of
affairs
did
not
by
any
means
restore
to
the
cities
of
lower
chaldæa
the
supreme
authority
which
they
once
possessed
babylon
had
made
such
good
use
of
its
centuries
of
rule
that
it
had
gained
upon
its
rivals
and
was
not
likely
now
to
fall
back
into
a
secondary
place
henceforward
no
matter
what
dynasty
came
into
power
as
soon
as
the
fortune
of
war
had
placed
it
upon
the
throne
babylon
succeeded
in
adopting
it

the

the

hommel
believed
he
had
discovered
in

an

was
followed
during

four
next
centuries
by
a
dynasty
of
ten
princes
in
uninterrupted
succession
their
rule
was
introduced
and
maintained
without
serious
opposition
the
small
principalities
of
the

theirs
by

the

we
have

be
content
to
remain
in

the

two
of
these
princes
melamkurkurra

eâgamîl
were
not
connected
with
each
other
and
had
no
direct

the
shortness
of
their
reigns
presents
a
striking
contrast
with
the
length
of
those
preceding
them
and
probably
indicates
a
period
of
war
or
revolution
when
these
princes
disappeared
we

not
how
or
why
about
the

they
were

it

a
rugged
and
unattractive
country
protected
by
nature
and
easy
to
defend
made
up
as
it
was
of
narrow
tortuous
valleys
of
plains
of
moderate
extent
but
of
rare
fertility
of
mountain
chains
whose
grim
sides
were
covered
with
forests
and
whose
peaks
were
during
half
the

and
of
rivers
or
more
correctly
speaking
torrents
for
the
rains
and
the
melting
of
the
snow
rendered
them
impassable
in
spring

autumn
the
entrance
to
this
region
was
by
two
or
three

an
enemy
were
unwilling
to
incur
the
loss
of
time
and
men
needed
to
carry
these

force
he
had
to
make
a
detour
by
narrow
along

the
assailants
were
obliged
to
advance

best
they
could

the
assaults

foe
concealed
among
the
rocks
and

entrenched
behind

natural
rampart

frequent
and
unexpected
raids
upon

place

these
tribes
were
governed
by
numerous
chiefs
acknowledging
a
single
king
whose
will
was
supreme
over
nearly
the
whole
country
some
of
them
had
a
slight
veneer
of
chaldæan
civilization
while
among
the
rest
almost
every
stage
of
barbarism
might
be
found
the
remains
of
their
language
show
that
it
was
remotely
allied
to
the
dialect
of
susa
and
contained
many
semitic
words
what
is
recorded
of
their
religion
reaches
us
merely
at
second
hand
and
the
groundwork
of
it
has
doubtless
been
modified
by
the
babylonian
scribes
who
have
transmitted
it
to
us
it
was
thus
in
the
time
of
alexander
and
his
successors
and
the
information
given
by
the
classical
historians
about
this
period
is
equally
applicable
to
earlier
times
as
we
may
conclude
from
the
numerous
passages
from
assyrian
inscriptions
which
have
been
collected
by
fr
delitzsch
delitzsch
conjectures
that
or
had
become
a
kind
of
proper
name
analogous
to
the
term
employed
by
the
egyptians
a
certain
number
of
cossæan
words
has
been
preserved
and
translated
some
in
one
of
the
royal
babylonian
lists
and
some
on
a
tablet
in
the
british
museum
discovered
and
interpreted
by
fr
delitzsch
several
assyriologists
think
that
they
showed
a
marked
affinity
with
the
idiom
of
the
susa
inscriptions
and
with
that
of
the
achæmenian
inscriptions
of
the
second
type
others
deny
the
proposed
connection
or
suggest
that
the
cossæan
language
was
a
semitic
dialect
related
to
the
oppert
who
was
the
first
to
point
out
the
existence
of
this
dialect
thirty
years

it
to

elamite
he
still
persists
in
his
opinion
and
has
published
several
notes
in

of

been
studied
by

insists
on
the
influence

merely
the
names
of
chaldæan
divinities
slightly
disguised
in
the
writing
they
worshipped
twelve
great
gods
of
whom
the
chief
kashshu
the
lord
of

the
principal
tribe
and
possibly
to
the
whole
race
shûmalia
queen
of
the
snowy
heights

enthroned
beside

and
the
divinities
next
in

sakh

represented
both

khala
answering

the
existence
of

is
proved
by
the
name
of
kashshunadinakhé
ashshur
also
bore
a
name
identical
with

of

worshippers
she
is
mentioned
in

to

the

frequenter
of

called
shimalia
in

but
delitzsch
has
restored
her
name

slightly
mutilated

of
her
statues

taken
by

where
the

translates
it

an

mutilated
and
only
the
initial

restored
halévy
considers
khala
or
khali
as
a
harsh
form
of
gula
if
this
is
the
case
the
cossæans
must
have
borrowed
the
name
and
perhaps
the
goddess
herself
from
their
chaldæan
neighbours

corresponded
both
to

youth
eager
to

have
been
often

to
quit

the
cossæan
king
who

was
named
gandish
and
the
few
inscriptions
we
possess
of
his
reign
are
cut
with
a
clumsiness
that
betrays
the
barbarism

these
sovereigns

from
some
forgotten
historian
of

that
the
cossæans
formerly

able
to
place
as
many
as

thousand
archers
in

in
the
wars
which
they

on

conclusions
have

denied

the
eyes
of

cossæans
who
saw
in
him
kharbê

turgu
the
recognised
patron
of
their
royal
family
for
this
reason
gandish
and
his
successors
regarded
bel
with
peculiar
devotion
these
kings
did
all
they
could
for
the
decoration
and
endowment
of
the
ancient
temple
of
ekur
which
had
been
somewhat
neglected
by
the
sovereigns
of
purely
babylonian
extraction
and
this
devotion
to
one
of
the
most
venerated
chaldæan
sanctuaries
contributed
largely
towards
their
winning
the
hearts
of
the
conquered
people
hilpreoht
calls
attention
on
this
point
to
the
fact
that
no
one
has
yet
discovered
at
nippur
a
single
consecrated
by
any
king
of
the
two
first
babylonian
dynasties
the
cossæan
rule
over
the
countries
of
the
euphrates
was
doubtless
similar
in
its
beginnings
to
that
which
the
hyksôs
exercised
at
first
over
the
nomes
of
egypt
the
cossæan
kings
did
not
merely
bring
with
them
an
army
to
protect
their
persons
or
to
occupy
a
small
number
of
important
posts
they
were
followed
by
the
whole
nation
and
spread
themselves
over
the
entire
country
the
bulk
of
the
invaders
instinctively
betook
themselves
to
districts
where
if
they
could
not
resume
the
kind
of
life
to
which
they
were
accustomed
in
their
own
land
they
could
at
least
give
full
rein
to
their
love
of
a
free
and
wild
existence
as
there
were
no
mountains
in
the
country
they
turned
to
the
marshes
and
like
the
hyksôs
in
egypt
made
themselves
at
home
about
the
mouths
of
the
rivers
on
the
low
lands
and
on
the
sandy
islets
of
the
lagoons
which
formed
an
undefined
borderland
between
the
alluvial
region
and
the
persian
gulf
the
covert
afforded
by
the
thickets
furnished
scope
for
the
chase
which
these
hunters
had
been
accustomed
to
pursue
in
the
depths
of
their
native
forests
while
fishing
on
the
other
hand
supplied
them
with
an
additional
element
of
food
when
their
depredations
drew
down
upon
them
reprisals
from
their
neighbours
the
mounds
occupied
by
their
fortresses
and
surrounded
by
muddy
swamps
offered
them
almost
as
secure
retreats
as
their
former
strongholds
on
the
lofty
sides
of
the
zagros
they
made
alliances
with
the
native
aramæans
with
those
kashdi
properly
called
chaldæans
whose
name
we
have
imposed
upon
all
the
nations
who
from
a
very
early
date
bore
rule
on
the
banks
of
the
lower
euphrates
here
they
formed
themselves
into
a
state
karduniash
whose
princes
at
times
rebelled
against
all
external
authority
and
at
other
times
acknowledged
the
sovereignty
of
the
babylonian
monarchs
the
state
of
karduniash
whose
name
appears
for
the
first
time
on
the
monuments
of
the
cossæan
period
has
been
localised
in
a
somewhat
vague
manner
in
the
south
of
babylonia
in
the
country
of
the
kashdi
and
afterwards
formally
identified
with
the
of
the
and
with
the
principality
which
was
called
in
the
assyrian
period
in
the
tablets
the
name
is
already
applied
to
the
entire
country
occupied
by
the
cossæan
kings
or
their
descendants
that
is
to
say
to
the
whole
of
babylonia
sargon
ii
at
that
time
distinguishes
between
an
upper
and
a
lower
karduniash
and
in
consequence
the
earliest
assyriologists
considered
it
as
an
assyrian
designation
of
babylon
or
of
the
district
surrounding
it
an
opinion
which
was
opposed
by
delitzsch
as
he
believed
it
to
be
an
indigenous
term
which
at
first
indicated
the
district
round
babylon
and
afterwards
the
whole
of
babylonia
from
one
frequent
spelling
of
the
name
the
meaning
appears
to
have
been
of
to
this
delitzsch
preferred
the
translation
of
from
an
erroneous
different
reading

a
cossæan
name
which
the
assyrians
translated
as
they
did
buriash

winckler
rejects
the
ancient
etymology
and
proposes
to
divide
the
word
as

to

in
it
a
cossæan
translation
of
the
expression

of
the
caldæans

side

another
foreign
element
which
while

its
homogeneity
did
not
destroy
its
natural
character
those
cossæan
tribes
who
had
not
quitted
their
own
country
retained
their
original
barbarism
but
the
hope
of
plunder
constantly
drew
them
from
their
haunts
and
they
attacked
and
devastated
the
cities
of
the
plain
unhindered
by
the
thought
that
they
were

of
their
armies
while
others
remained
at

and

themselves
in
the
of
the
kings
halévy
has
at

proved
that
the
khabiri
mentioned
in
the
tel
tablets
were
cossæans
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
sayce
who
makes

grouped
round
hebron
which
max
müller
seems
to
accept
winckler
returning
to
an
old
opinion

them
to
have
been
hebrews
to
the
last
they
were
an
undisciplined
militia
dangerous
and
difficult
to
please
one
day
they
would
hail
their
chiefs
with
acclamations
to
kill
them
the
next
in
one
of
those
sudden
outbreaks
in
which
they
were
accustomed
to
make
and
unmake
their
kings
the
first
invaders
were
not
long
in
acquiring
by
means
of
daily
intercourse
with
the
old
inhabitants
the
new
civilization
sooner
or
later
they
became
blended
with
the
natives
losing
all
their
own
peculiarities
with
the
exception
of
their
outlandish
names
a
few
heroic
legends
and
the
worship
of
two
or
three
gods
shûmalia
shugab
and
shukamuna
this
is
the
opinion
of
hommel
supported
by
the
testimony
of
the
in
this
latter
document
the
cossæans
are
found
revolting
against
king
kadashmankharbé
and
replacing
him
on
the
throne
by
a
certain
nazibugash
who
was
of
obscure
origin
pr
delitzsch
and
schrader
compare
their
name
with
that
of
kush
who
appears
in
the
bible
as
the
father
of
nimrod
x
hommel
and
sayce
think
that
the
history
of
nimrod
is
a
reminiscence
of
the
cossæan
rule
jensen
is
alone
in
his
attempt
to
attribute
to
the
cossæans
the
first
idea
of
the
epic
of
gilgames
as
in
the
case
of
the
hyksôs
in
africa
the
barbarian
conquerors
thus
became
merged
in
the
more
civilized
people
which
they
had
subdued
this
work
of
assimilation
seems
at
first
to
have
occupied
the
whole
attention
of
both
races
for
the
immediate
successors
of
gandish
were
unable
to
retain
under
their
rule
all
the
provinces
of
which
the
empire
was
formerly
composed
they
continued
to
possess
the
territory
situated
on
the
middle
course
of
the
euphrates
as
far
as
the
mouth
of
the
balikh
but
they
lost
the
region
extending
to
the
east
of
the
khabur
at
the
foot
of
the
masios
and
in
the
upper
basin
of
the
tigris
the
vicegerents
of
assur
also
withdrew
from
them
and
declaring
that
they
owed
no
obedience
excepting
to
the
god
of
their
city
assumed
the
royal
dignity
the
first
four
of
these
kings
whose
names
have
come
down
to
us
sulili
belkapkapu
adasi
and
belbâni
appear
to
have
been
but
indifferent
rulers
but
they
knew
bow
to
hold
their
own
against
the
attacks
of
their
neighbours
and
when
after
a
century
of
weakness
and
inactivity
babylon
reasserted
herself
and
endeavoured
to
recover
her
lost
territory
they
had
so
completely
established
their
independence
that
every
attack
on
it
was
unsuccessful
the
cossæan
king
at
that
time
an
active
and
enterprising
prince
whose
name
was
held
in
honour
up
to
the
days
of
the
ninevite
supremacy
was
agumkakrimê
the
son
of
tassigurumash
these
four
names
do
not
so
much
represent
four
consecutive
reigns
as
two
separate
traditions
which
were
current
respecting
the
beginnings
of
assyrian
royalty
the
most
ancient
of
them
gives
the
chief
place
to
two
personages
named
belkapkapu
and
sulili
this
tradition
has
been
transmitted
to
us
by
rammânnirâri
because
it
connected
the
origin
of
his
race
with
these
kings
the
second
tradition
placed
a
certain
belbâni
the
son
of
adasi
in
the
room
of
belkapkapu
and
sulili
esarhaddon
made
use
of
it
in
order
to
ascribe
to
his
own
family
an
antiquity
at
least
equal
to
that
of
the
family
to
which
rammânnirâri
iii
belonged
each
king
appropriated
from
the
ancient
popular
traditions
those
names
which
seemed
to
him
best
calculated
to
enhance
the
prestige
of
his
dynasty
but
we
can
not
tell
how
far
the
personages
selected
enjoyed
an
authentic
historical
existence
it
is
best
to
admit
them
at
least
provisionally
into
the
royal
series
without
trusting
too
much
to
what
is
related
of
them
the
tablet
discovered
by
pinches
is
broken
after
the
fifth
king
of
the
dynasty
the
inscription
of
agumkakrimê
containing
a
genealogy
of
this
prince
which
goes
back
as
far
as
the
fifth
generation
has
led
to
the
restoration
of
the
earlier
part
of
the
list
as
follows
gandish
gaddash
adumitasii
gandê
tassigurumash
agumrabi

son
agumkakrimê
a
guyashi

and
the
four

him
obedience
on
the
other
hand
elam
revolted
from
its
allegiance
assur
resisted
him
and
if
he
still
exercised
some
semblance
of
authority
over
northern
syria
it
was
owing
to
a
traditional
respect
which
the
towns
of
that
country
voluntarily
rendered
to
him
but
which
did
not
involve
either
subjection
or
control
the
people
of
khâni
still
retained
possession
of
the
statues
of
merodach
and
of
his
consort
zarpanit
which
had
been
stolen
we
know
not
how
some
time
previously
from
chaldæa
agumkakrimê
recovered
them
and
replaced
them
in
their
proper
temple
this
was
an
important
event
and
earned
him
the
good
will
of
the
priests
the
translation
and
complexioned
is
uncertain
jensen
interprets
the
epithet
to
mean
guti
stupid
foolish
culpable
the
guti
held
both
banks
of
the
lower
zab
in
the
mountains
on
the
east
of

delitzsch
has
placed
padan
and
alman
in
the
mountains

the
east
of
the
diyâleh
jensen
places
them
in
the
chain
of
the

the

by
delitzsch
in
the

in

accounts
of
the
assyrian
campaigns
that
is
to
say
in
the
amanos
between
the
euphrates
and
the
bay
of
alexandretta
he
is
inclined
to
regard
the
name
as
a
form
of
that
of
the
khâti
the
king
reorganised
public
worship
he
caused
new
fittings
for
the
temples
to
be
made
to
take
the
place
of
those
which
had
disappeared
and
the
inscription
which
records
this
work
enumerates
with
satisfaction
the
large
quantities
of
crystal
jasper
and
which
he
lavished
on
the
sanctuary
the
utensils
of
silver
and
gold
which
he
dedicated
together
with
the
of
wrought
bronze
decorated
with
monsters
and
religious
emblems
this
restoration
of
the
statues
so
flattering
to
the
national
pride
and
piety
would
have
been
exacted
and
insisted
upon
by
a
khammurabi
at
the
point
of
the
sword
but
agumkakrimê
doubtless
felt
that
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
run
the
risk
of
war
he
therefore
sent
an
embassy
to
the
khâni
and
such
was
the
prestige
which
the
name
of
babylon
still
possessed
from
the
deserts
of
the
caspian
to
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
that
he
was
able
to
obtain
a
concession
from
that
people
which
he
would
probably
have
been
powerless
to
extort
by
force
of
arms
we
do
not
possess
the
original
of
the
inscription
which
tells
us
of
these
facts
but
merely
an
early
copy
strictly
speaking
one
might
suppose
that
a
war
took
place
but
most
assyriologists
declare
unhesitatingly
that
there
was
merely
an
embassy
and
a
diplomatic
negotiation
the
egyptians
had
therefore
no
need
to
anticipate
chaldæan
interference
when
forsaking
their
ancient
traditions
they
penetrated
for
the
first
time
into
the
heart
of
syria
not
only
was
babylon
no
longer
supreme
there
but
the
coalition
of
those
cities
on
which
she
had
depended
for
help
in
subduing
the
west
was
partially
dissolved
and
the
foreign
princes
who
had
succeeded
to
her
patrimony
were
so
far
conscious
of
their
weakness
that
they
voluntarily
kept
aloof
from
the
countries
in
which
previous
to
their
advent
babylon
had
held
undivided
sway
the
egyptian
conquest
of
syria
had
already
begun
in
the
days
of
agumkakrimê
and
it
is
possible
that
dread
of
the
pharaoh
was
one
of
the
chief
causes
which
influenced
the
cossæans
to
return
a
favourable
answer
to
the
khâni
thûtmosis
on
entering
syria
encountered
therefore
only
the
native
levies
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
in
spite
of
their
renowned
courage
they
were
not
likely
to
prove
formidable
adversaries
in
egyptian
estimation
not
one
of
the
local
syrian
dynasties
was
sufficiently
powerful
to
collect
all
the
forces
of
the
country
around
its
chief
so
as
to
oppose
a
compact
body
of
troops
to
the
attack
of
the
african
armies
the
whole
country
consisted
of
a
collection
of
petty
states
a
complex
group
of
peoples
and
territories
which
even
the
egyptians
themselves
never
completely
succeeded
in
disentangling
they
classed
the
inhabitants
however
under
three
or
four
very
comprehensive
names
kharû
zahi
lotanû
and
kefâtiû
all
of
which
frequently
recur
in
the
inscriptions
but
without
having
always
that
exactness
of
meaning
we
look
for
in
geographical
terms
as
was
often
the
case
in
similar
circumstances
these
names
were
used
at
first
to
denote
the
districts
close
to
the
egyptian
frontier
with
which
the
inhabitants
of
the
delta
had
constant
intercourse
the
kefâtiû
seem
to
have
been
at
the
outset
the
people
of
the
more
especially
of
the
region
occupied
later
by
the
phoenicians
but
all
the
tribes
with
whom
the
phoenicians
came
in
contact
on
the
asiatic
and
european
border
were

later

originally
identified
with
the
inhabitants
of

subsequently
with
those
of
cilicia

the
decree
of
canopus

them

zahi
originally
comprised
that
portion
of
the
desert
and
of
the
maritime
plain
on
the
of
egypt
which
was
coasted
by
the
fleets
or
traversed
by
the
armies
of
egypt
as
they
passed
to
and
fro
between
syria
and
the
banks
of
the
nile
this
region
had
been
ravaged
by
ahmosis
during
his
raid
upon
sharuhana
the
year
after
the
fall
of
avaris
to
the
of
zahi
lay
kharû
it
included
the
greater
part
of
mount
seir
whose
wadys
thinly
dotted
over
with
oases
were
inhabited
by
tribes
of
more
or
less
stationary
habits
the
approaches
to
it
were
protected
by
a
few
towns
or
rather
fortified
villages
built
in
the
neighbourhood
of
springs
and
surrounded
by
cultivated
fields
and
gardens
but
the
bulk
of
the
people
lived
in
tents
or
in
caves
on
the
the
egyptians
constantly
confounded
those
khauri
whom
the
hebrews
in
found
scattered
among
the
children
of
edom
with
the
other
tribes
of
bedouin

designated

beyond
to
the
north
of
kharû
and
to
the
of
zahi
among
the
hills
which
separate
the
from
the
jordan
the
name
of
lotanû
or
rotanû
has
been
assigned
by
brugsch
to
the
assyrians
but
subsequently
by
connecting
it
more
ingeniously
than
plausibly
with
the
assyrian
he
extended
it
to
all
the
peoples
of
the
north
we
now
know
that
in
the
texts
it
denotes
the
whole
of
syria
and
more
generally
all
the
peoples
dwelling
in
the
basins
of
the
orontes
and
the
euphrates
the
attempt
to
connect
the
name
rotanû
or
lotanû
with
that
of
the
edomite
tribe
of
lotan
xxxvi
was
first
made
by
de
saulcy
it
was
afterwards
taken
up
by
haigh
and
adopted
by
renan
as
it
was
more
remote
from
the
isthmus
and
formed
the
egyptian
horizon
in
that
direction
all
the
new
countries
with
which
the
egyptians
became
acquainted
beyond
its
northern
limits
were
by
degrees
included
under
the
one
name
of
lotanû
and
this
term
was
extended
to
comprise
successively
the
entire
valley
of
the
jordan
then
that
of
the
orontes
and
finally
even
that
of
the
euphrates
lotanû
became
thenceforth
a
vague
and
fluctuating
term
which
the
egyptians
applied
indiscriminately
to
widely
differing
asiatic
nations
and
to
which
they
added
another
indefinite
epithet
when
they
desired
to
use
it
in
a
more
limited
sense
that
part
of
syria
nearest
to
egypt
being
in
this
case
qualified
as
upper
lotanû
while
the
towns
and
kingdoms
further
north
were
described
as
being
in
lower
lotanû
in
the
same
way
the
terms
zahi
and
kharû
were
extended
to
cover
other
and
more
northerly
regions
zahi
was
applied
to
the
coast
as
far
as
the
mouth
of
the
nahr
and
to
the
country
of
the
lebanon
which
lay
between
the
mediterranean
and
the
middle
course
of
the
orontes
kharû
ran
parallel
to
zahi
but
comprised
the
mountain
district
and
came
to
include
most
of
the
countries
which
were
at
first
ranged
under
upper
lotanû
it
was
never
applied
to
the
region
beyond
the
neighbourhood
of
mount
tabor
nor
to
the
provinces
the
three
names
in
their
wider
sense
preserved
the
same
relation
to
each
other
as
before
zahi
lying
to
the
west
and
of
kharû
and
lower
lotanû
to
the
north
of
kharû
and
of
zahi
but
the
extension
of
meaning
did
not
abolish
the
old
conception
of
their
position
and
hence
arose
confusion
in
the
minds
of
those
who
employed
them
the
scribes
for
instance
who
registered
in
some
theban
temple
the
victories
of
the
pharaoh
would
sometimes
write
zahi
where
they
should
have
inscribed
kharû
and
it
is
a
difficult
matter
for
us
always
to
detect
their
mistakes
it
would
be
unjust
to
blame
them
too
severely
for
their
inaccuracies
for
what
means
had
they
of
determining
the
relative
positions
of
that
confusing
collection
of
states
with
which
the
egyptians
came
in
contact
as
soon
as
they
had
set
foot
on
syrian
soil
a
choice
of
several
routes
into
asia
possessing
unequal
advantages
was
open
to
the
traveller

the
most
direct
of
them
passed
through

old
entrenchments

from
the
ked
sea
to
the
marshes
of

the
isthmus
and
beyond
these
forming
an
additional
defence
was
a
canal
on
the
banks

a
fortress
was
constructed
this
was
occupied
by
the
troops

guarded
the
frontier

was
allowed

the

met
so
satisfactorily
all
political

commercial
requirements
that
the
administrators
of
the
pharaohs
never
troubled
themselves
to
discover
the
various
elements
concealed
beneath
the
term
we
are
however
able
at
the
present
time
to
distinguish
among
them
several
groups
of
peoples
and
languages
all
belonging
to
the
same
family
but
possessing
distinctive
characteristics
the
kinsfolk
of
the
hebrews
the
children
of
ishmael
and
edom
the
moabites
and
ammonites
who
were
all
qualified
as
shaûsû

spread
over
the
region
to
the
south
and
east
of
the
dead
sea
partly
in
the
desert
and
partly
on
the
confines
of
the
cultivated
land
the
canaanites
were
not
only
in
possession
of
the
coast
from
gaza
to
a
point
beyond
the
nahr
but
they
also
occupied
almost
the
whole
valley
of
the
jordan
besides
that
of
the
litâny
and
perhaps
that
of
the
upper
orontes
there
were
aramaean
settlements
at
damascus
in
the
plains
of
the
lower
orontes
and
in

i
use
the
term
canaanite
with
the
meaning
most
frequently
attached
to
it
according
to
the
hebrew
use
x
this
word
is
found
several
times
in
the
egyptian
texts
under
the
forms
kinakhna
kinakhkhi
and
probably
kûnakhaîû
in
the
cuneiform
texts
of
tel
as
far
as
i
know
the
term
aramæan
is
not
to
be
found
in
any
egyptian
text
of
the
time
of
the
pharaohs
the
only
known
example
of
it
is
a
error
corrected
by
chabas
max
müller
very
justly
observes
that
the
mistake
is
itself
a
proof
of
the
existence
of
the
name
and
of
the
acquaintance
of
the
egyptians
with
it
the
country
beyond
the
aramaean
territory
including
the
slopes
of
the
amanos
and
the
deep
valleys
of
the
taurus
was
inhabited
by
peoples
of
various
origin
the
most
powerful
of
these
the
khâti
were
at
this
time
slowly
forsaking
the
mountain
region
and
spreading
by
degrees
over
the
country
between
the
afrîn
and
the
euphrates
the
canaanites
were
the
most
numerous
of
all
these
groups
and
had
they
been
able
to
amalgamate
under
a
single
king
or
even
to
organize
a
lasting
confederacy
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
egyptian
armies
to
have
broken
through
the
barrier
thus
raised
between
them
and
the
rest
of
asia
but
unfortunately
so
far
from
showing
the
slightest
tendency
towards
unity
or
concentration
the
canaanites
were
more
hopelessly
divided
than
any
of
the
surrounding
nations
their
mountains
contained
nearly
as
many
states
as
there
were
valleys
while
in
the
plains
each
town
represented
a
separate
government
and
was
built
on
a
spot
carefully
selected
for
purposes
of
defence
the
land
indeed
was
chequered
with
these
petty
states
and
so
closely
were
they
crowded
together
that
a
horseman
travelling
at
leisure
could
easily
pass
through
two
or
three
of
them
in
a
journey
thûtmosis
iii
shows
that
at
any
rate
they
were
established
in
these
regions
about
the
xvith
century
the
egyptian
pronunciation
of
their
name
is
with
the
feminine
but
the
tel
texts
employ
the
vocalisation
which
must
be
more
correct
than
that
of
the
egyptians
the
form
seems
to
me
to
be
explicable
by
an
error
of
popular
etymology
egyptian
ethnical
appellations
in
formed
their
plural
by
so
that
if
were
taken
for
a
plural
it
would
naturally
have
suggested
to
the
scribes
the
form
for
the
singular
thûtmosis
speaking
to
his
soldiers
tells
them
that
all
the
chiefs
the
projecting
spur
of
some
mountain
or
on
a
solitary
and
more
or
less
irregularly
shaped
eminence
in
the
midst
of
a
plain
and
the
means
of
defence
in
the
country
are
shut
up
in
megiddo
so
that
take
it
is
to
take
a
thousand
cities
this
is
evidently
a
hyperbole
in
the
mouth
of
the
conqueror
but
the
exaggeration
itself
shows
how
numerous
were
the
chiefs
and
consequently
the
small
states
in
central
and
southern
syria
not
only
were
the
royal
cities
fenced
with
walls
but
many
of
the
surrounding
villages
were
fortified
while
the
or
built
at
the
bends
of
the
roads
at
the
fords
over
the
rivers
and
at
the
openings
of
the
ravines
all
testified
to
the
insecurity
of
the
times
and
the
aptitude
for
shown
by
the
inhabitants
this
canaanite
word
was
borrowed
by
the
egyptians
from
the
syrians
at
the
beginning
of
their
asiatic
wars
they
employed
it
in
forming
the
names

military
posts

they
established

the
engineer
in
syria
however
the
positions
suitable
for
the
construction
of
fortresses
hardly
ever
lent
themselves
to
a
symmetrical
plan
the
usual
sites
had
to
be
adapted
in
each
case
to
suit
the
particular
configuration
of
the
ground
illustration
the
walled
city
of
dapûr
in
galilee
drawn
by
from
a
photograph
taken
at
karnak
by
beato
it
was
usually
a
mere
wall
of
stone
or
dried
brick
with
towers
at
intervals
the
wall
measuring
from
nine
to
twelve
feet
thick
at
the
base
and
from
thirty
to
feet
high
thus
rendering
an
assault
by
means
of
portable
ladders
nearly
impracticable
this
is
at
least
the
result
of
investigations
made
by
modern
engineers
who
have
studied
these
questions
of
military
archæology
the
gateway
had
the
appearance
of
a
fortress
in
itself
it
was
composed
of
three
large
blocks
of
masonry
forming
a
face
considerably
higher
than
the
adjacent
curtains
and
pierced
near
the
top
with
square
openings
furnished
with
mantlets
so
as
to
give
both
a
front
and
flank
view
of
the
assailants
the
wooden
doors
in
the
receded
face
were
covered
with
metal
and

most
of
the
canaanite
towns
taken
by

in
the
campaign
of
his
viiith
year
were
fortified
in
this
manner
it
must
have
been
the
usual
method
of
fortification
as
it
seems
to
have
served
as
a
type
for
conventional
representation
and
was
sometimes
used
to
denote
cities
which
had
fortifications

another
kind

represented
in
this
way
while
a
picture
on
another
monument
which
is
reproduced
in
the
illustration
on
page
represents
what
seems
to
have
been
the
particular
form
of
its
encompassing
walls
the
building
was
strong
enough
not
only
to
defy
the
bands
of
adventurers
who
roamed
the
country
but
was
able
to
resist
for
an
indefinite
time
the
operations
of
a
regular
siege
sometimes
however
the
inhabitants
when
constructing
their
defences
did
not
confine
themselves
to
this
rudimentary
plan
but
threw
up
earthworks
round
the
selected
site
on
the
most
exposed
side
they
raised
an
advance
wall
not
exceeding
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
in
height
at
the
left
extremity
of
which
the
entrance
was
so
placed
that
the
assailants
in
endeavouring
to
force
their
way
through
were
obliged
to
expose
an
unprotected
flank
to
the
defenders
by
this
arrangement
it
was
necessary
to
break
through
two
lines
of
fortification
before
the
place
could
be
entered
supposing
the
enemy
to
have
overcome
these
first
obstacles
they
would
find
themselves
at
their
next
point
of
attack
confronted
with
a
citadel
which
contained
in
addition
to
the
sanctuary
of
the
principal
god
the
palace
of
the
sovereign
himself
this
also
had
a
double
enclosing
wall
and
massively
built
gates
which
could
be
forced
only
at
the
expense
of
fresh
losses
unless
the
cowardice
or
treason
of
the
garrison
made
the
assault
an
easy
one
the
type
of

based
on
a

of
the
invading
hosts
not
a

is
to
be

they
may
have
been
razed
to
the
ground

one
of
those
destructive
revolutions
to
which
the
country
was
often
exposed

their
remains
may
lie
hidden

the
heaps
of
ruins
which
thirty
centuries
of
change
have
raised
over
them
the
only
remains
of
a
canaanite
fortification
which
can
be
assigned
to
the
egyptian
period
are
those
which
professor
petrie
brought
to
light
in
the
ruins
of
tell
and
in
which
he
rightly
recognised
the
remains
of
lachish

records
of
victories
graven
on
the
walls
of
the
theban
temples
furnish
it
is
true
a
general
conception
of
their
appearance
but
the
notions
of
them
which
we
should
obtain
from
this
source
would
be
of
a
very
confused
character
had
not
one
of
the
last
of
the
conquering
pharaohs
ramses
taken
it
into
his
head
to
have
one
built
at
thebes
itself
to
contain
within
it
in
addition
to
his
funerary
chapel
accommodation
for
the
attendants
assigned
to
the
conduct
of
his
worship
in
the
greek
and
roman
period
a
portion
of
this
fortress
was
demolished
but
the
external
wall
of
defence
still
exists
on
the
eastern
side
together
with
the
gate
which
is
commanded
on
the
right
by
a
projection
of
the
and
flanked
by
two
rectangular
in
shape
and
having
roofs
which
jut
out
about
a
yard
beyond
the
wall
of
support
having
passed
through
these
obstacles
we
find
ourselves
face
to
face
with
a
of
cut
stone
nearly
square
in
form
with
two
projecting
wings
the
court
between
their
walls
being
made
to
contract
gradually
from
the
point
of
approach
by
a
series
of
abutments
a
careful
examination
of
the
place
indeed
reveals
more
than
one
arrangement
which
the
limited
knowledge
of
the
egyptians
would
hardly
permit
us
to
expect
we
discover
for
instance
that
the
main
body
of
the
building
is
made
to
rest
upon
a
sloping
which
rises
to
a
height
of
some
sixteen
feet
this
served
two
purposes
it
increased
in
the
first
place
the
strength
of
the
defence
against
sapping
and
in
the
second
it
caused
the
weapons
launched
by
the
enemy
to
rebound
with
violence
from
its
inclined
surface
thus
serving
to
keep
the
assailants
at
a
distance
the
whole
structure
has
an
imposing
look
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
royal
architects
charged
with
carrying
out
their
idea
brought
to
their
task
an
attention
to
detail
for
which
the
people
from
whom
the
plan
was
borrowed
had
no
capacity
and
at
the
same
time
preserved
the
arrangements
of
their
model
so
faithfully
that
we
can
readily
realise

it
must
have
been

some
score
of
low

miserable
hovels

us
an

in
a
striking
manner

any
other
small
modern

gathers
the

its

the

we
have
seen
that
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
it
was
used
by
the
babylonians
to
denote
all
syria
if
the

given
by

cuneiform
inscriptions
to

really
means
fortress

we
should
have
in
this
fact
a
proof
that
this
people
were
in
actual
possession
of
the
damascene
syria

must
have
been
taken
from

pilgrims

to

they
never

so

in

the
confusion
must
already
have
been

if
we
are
to

from

of
them
carried
away
by

movement

led
to
the
invasion
of

hyksôs

settled
around

the
rugged
nature
of
the

served
to
protect

from

very
early
times

are
described
as
dwelling

majority
of
commentators
have
been
indisposed
to
admit
the
existence
of
southern
hittites
this
name

is
alleged
having
been
introduced
into
the
biblical
around

through
a
misconception
of
the
original
documents

the
term
hittite
was
the
equivalent
of
canaanite

section

had
established
themselves
within

others
had
settled
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
southern
hittites
in
such
numbers
that
their
name
in
the
hebrew
scriptures
was
at
times
employed
to
designate
the
western
mountainous
region
about
the
dead
sea

has
established
the
fact
that
the
term
amorite
as
well
as
the
parallel
word
canaanite
was
the
designation
of
the
inhabitants
of
palestine

the

to
the
prevailing
tradition
in

the
latter
to
that
which
was
current
in

this
view
confirms
the
conclusion
which
may
be
drawn
from
the
egyptian
monuments
as
to
the
power
of
expansion
and
the
diffusion
of
the
people
these
were
the
amorites

the
tribe
of
dan
at
a
later
period
could
not
dislodge
from

had
been
allotted

us
everywhere
under
different

names
with
representations
of
a
people
of
high
stature
in
youth
but
with
a
fatal
tendency
to
obesity

age

heads
are

associated
with
their
efforts
after
true
and
exact
representation
a
certain
caustic
humour
which
impelled
them
often
to
substitute
for
a
portrait
a
more
or
less
jocose
caricature
of
their
adversaries
on
the
walls
of
the
pylons
and
in
places
where
the
majesty
of
a
god
restrained
them
from
departing

contented
themselves
with
exaggerating

followed
behind

which
his

had
been
subjected

chaldæa
were
identical
the
syrian
princes
are
there
represented
as
employing
the
cuneiform
character
in
their
correspondence
being
accompanied
by
scribes
brought
up
after
the
chaldæan
manner
we
shall
see
later
on
that
the
king
of
the
khati
who
represented
in
the
time
of
ramses
ii
the
type
of
an
accomplished
syrian
had
attendants
similar
to
those
of
the
chaldæan
kings
from
all
that
we
can
gather
in
short
from
the
silence
as
well
as
from
the
misunderstandings
of
the
egyptian
chroniclers
syria
stands
before
us
as
a
fruitful
and
civilized
country
of
which
one
might
be
thankful
to
be
a
native
in
spite
of
continual
wars
and
frequent
revolutions
the
religion
of
the
syrians
was
subject
to
the
same
influences
as
their
customs
we
are
as
yet
far
from
being
able
to
draw
a
complete
picture
of
their
theology
but
such
knowledge
as
we
do
possess
recalls
the
same
names
and
the
same
elements
as
are
found
in
the
religious
systems
of
chaldæa
the
myths
it
is
true
are
still
vague
and
misty
at
least
to
our
modern
ideas
the
general
characteristics
of
the
principal
divinities
alone
stand
out
and
seem
fairly
well
defined
as
with
the
other
semitic
races
the
deity
in
a
general
sense
the
primordial
type
of
the
godhead
was
called
or
and
his
feminine
counterpart
but
we
find
comparatively
few
cities
in
which
these
nearly
abstract
beings
enjoyed
the
veneration
of
the
faithful
the
gods
of
syria
like
those
of
egypt
and
of
the
countries
watered
by
the
euphrates
were
feudal
princes
distributed
over
the
surface
of
the
earth
their
number
corresponding
with
that
of
the
independent
states
each
nation
each
tribe
each
city
worshipped
its
own
lord
or
its
master
and
each
of
these
was
designated
by
a
special
title
to
distinguish
him
from
neighbouring
or
masters
the
frequent
occurrence
of
the
term
or
in
names
of
towns
in
southern
syria
seems
to
indicate
pretty
conclusively
that
the
inhabitants
of
these
countries
used
this
term
by
preference
to
designate
their
supreme
god
similarly
we
meet
with
it
in
aramaic
names
and
later
on
among
the
nabathseans
it
predominates
at
byblos
and
berytus
in
phoenicia
and
among
the
aramaic
peoples
of
north
syria
in
the
samalla
country
for
instance
during
the
viiith
century
the
extension
of
this
term
to
syrian
countries
is
proved
in
the
israelitish
epoch
by
canaanitish
names
such
as
adonizedek
and
adonibezek
or
jewish
names
such
as
adonijah
adonikam
movers
tried
to
prove
that
there
was
one
particular
god
named
baal
and
his
ideas
popularised
in
prance
by
de
vogiié
prevailed
for
some
time
since
then
scholars
have
gone
back
to
the
view
of
münter
and
of
the
writers
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
who
regarded
the
term
baal
as
a
common
epithet
applicable
to
all
gods
the
baal
who
ruled
at
zebub
was
styled
of
zebub
or
and
the
baal
of
hermon
who
was
an
ally
of
gad
goddess
of
fortune
was
sometimes
called
or
of
hermon
sometimes
or
of
gad
the
baal
of
shechem
at
the
time
of
the
israelite
invasion
was
of
the
doubtless
in
memory
of
some
agreement
which
he
had
concluded
with
his
worshippers
in
regard
to
the
conditions
of
their
allegiance
was
worshipped
at
ekxon
during
the
philistine
supremacy

the
mountain
of
baniâs
where
the
jordan
has
one
of
its
sources
and
the
town

the
variant
occurs
several
times
in
the
biblical
books
like
only
occurs
so
far
as
we
know
at
present
in
the
hebrew
scriptures
where
by
the
way
the
first
element
baal
is
changed
to

and
children
from
the
tomb
of

by
from
coloured
sketches
by
prisse
the
prevalent
conception
of
the
essence
and
attributes
of
these
deities
was
not
the
same
in
all
their
sanctuaries
but
the
more
exalted
among
them
were
regarded
as
personifying
the
sky
in
the
daytime
or
at
night
the
atmosphere
the
light
or
the
sun
shamash
as
creator
and
prime
mover
of
the

appears
under
the
name
or
in
the
samalla
inscriptions
of
the
viiith
century
it
is
so
far
a
unique
instance
among
the
semites
we
find
the
term
applied
in
the
bible
to
the
national
god
of
the
ammonites
under
the
forms
molech
mikôm
and
especially
with
the
article
the
real
name
hidden
beneath
this
epithet
was
probably
or
and
strictly
speaking
the
god
moloch
only
exists
in
the
imagination
of
scholars
the
epithet
was
used
among
the
oanaanites
in
the
name
melchizedek
a
similar
form
to
adonizedek
abimelech
ahimelech
it
was
in
current
use
among
the
phoenicians
in
reference
to
the
god
of
tyre
or
melkarth
and
in
many
proper
names
such
as
melekiathon
baalmelek
bodmalek
not
to
mention
the
god
milichus
worshipped
in
spain
who
was
really
none
other
than
melkarth
resheph
has
been
vocalised
in
deference
to
the
egyptian
orthography
rashupu
it
was
a
name
common
to
a
whole
family
of
lightning
and
and
de
rougé
pointed
out
long
ago
the
passage
in
the
great
inscription
of
ramses
iii
at
in
which
the
soldiers
who
man
the
chariots
are
compared
to
the
rashupu
the
rabbinic
hebrew
still
employs
this
plural
form
in
the
sense
of
the
phoenician
inscriptions
contain
references
to
several
local
rashufs
the
way
in
which
this
god
is
coupled
with
the
goddess
qodshu
on
the
egyptian
stelæ
leads
me
to
think
that
at
the
epoch
now
under
consideration
he
was
specially
worshipped
by
the
amorites
just
as
his
equivalent
hadad
was
by
the
inhabitants
of
damascus
neighbours
of
the
amorites
and
perhaps
themselves
amorites
rammânu
dagon
patron
god
of
fishermen
and
husbandmen
seems
to
have
watched
over
the
fruitfulness
of
the
sea
and
the
land
we
are
beginning
to
learn
the
names
of
the
races
whom
they
specially
protected
rashuf
the
amorites
hadad
and
rimmon
the
aramæans
of
damascus
dagon
the
peoples
of
the
coast
between
ashkelon
and
the
forest
of
carmel
rashûf
is
the
only
one
whose
appearance
is
known
to
us
he
possessed
the
restless
temperament
usually
attributed
to
the
and
was
accordingly
pictured
as
a
soldier
armed
with
javelin
and
mace
bow
and
buckler
a
head
with
pointed
horns
surmounts
his
helmet
and
sometimes
it
may
be
serves
him
as
a
cap
hadad
and
rimmon
are
represented
in
by
one
and
the
same
ideogram
which
may
be
read
either
hadad
or
eammânu
the
identity
of
the
expressions
employed
shows
how
close
the
connection
between
the
two
divinities
must
have
been
even
if
they
were
not
similar
in
all
respects
from
the
hebrew
writings
we
know
of
the
temple
of
rimmon
at
damascus
and
that
one
of
the
kings
of
that
city
was
called
tabrimmôn
is
xv
while
hadad
gave
his
name
to
no
less
than
ten
kings
of
the
same
city
even
as
late
as
the
roman
epoch
kingship
over
the
other
gods
was
still
attributed
both
to
rimmon
and
to
hadad
but
this
latter
was
identified
with
the
sun
the
documents
which
we
possess
in
regard
to
dagon
date
from
the
hebrew
epoch
and
represent
him
as
worshipped
by
the
philistines
we
know
however
from
the
tel
tablets
of
a
dagantakala
a
name
which
proves
the
presence
of
the
god
among
the
canaanites
long
before
the
philistine
invasion
and
we
find
two
one
in
the
plain
of
judah
the
other
in
the
tribe
of
asher
philo
of
byblos
makes
dagon
a
phoenician
deity
and
declares
him
to
be
the
genius
of
fecundity
master
of
grain
and
of
labour
the
representation
of
his
statue
which
appears
on
the
roman
coins
of
abydos
reminds
us
of
the
of
chaldæa
each
god
had
for
his
complement
a
goddess
who
was
proclaimed
of
the
city
or
of
heaven
just
as
the
god
himself
was
recognised
as
or
as
a
rule
the
goddess
was
contented
with
the
generic
name
of
astartê
but
to
this
was
often
added
some
epithet
which
lent
her
a
distinct
personality
and
prevented
her
from
being
confounded
with
the
astartês
of
neighbouring
cities
her
companions
or
rivals
among
goddesses
to
whom
the
title
referred
we
have
the
goddess
of
byblos
also
the
goddess
of
berytus
or
beyrut
the
epithet
of
heaven
applied
to
the
phoenician
astartê
by
hebrew
vii
xliv
and
classic
writers
the
egyptians
when
they
adopted
these
oanaanitish
goddesses
preserved
the
title
and
called
each
of
them
pit
of
in
the
phoenician
inscriptions
their
names
are
frequently
preceded
by
the
word
rabbat
my
lady
the
hebrew
writers
frequently
refer
to
the
canaanite
goddesses
by
the
general
title
or
and
a
town
in
northern
syria
bore
the
significant
name
of
istarâti
ishtars
the
ashtarôth
a
name
which
finds
a
parallel
in
anathôth
anats
a
title
assumed
by
a
town
of
the
tribe
of
benjamin
similarly
the
chaldæans
called
their
goddesses
by
the
plural
of
ishtar
the
inscription
on
an
egyptian
amulet
in
the
louvre
tells
us
of
a
personage
of
the
xxth
dynasty
who
from
his
name
rabrabîna
must
have
been
of
syrian
origin
and
who
styled
himself

a
sphinx
drawn

thus
she
would
be
styled
the
astartê
ashtoreth
naamah
or
the
astartê
ashtoreth
qarnaîm
because
of
the
lunar
crescent
which
appears
on
her
forehead
as
a
sort
of
she
was
the
goddess
of
good
luck
and
was
called
gad
she
was
anat

asîti
the
chaste
and
the
warlike
the
astartê
gave
her
name
to
a
city
beyond
the
jordan
of
which
she
was
probably
the
eponymous
goddess

she
would
seem
to
be
represented
on
the
curious
monument
called
by
the
arabs
stone
of
job
which
was
discovered
by
schumacher
in
the
centre
of
the
hauran
it
was
an
analogous
goddess

egyptians
sometimes
identified
with
their
hâthor

whom
they
represented
as
crowned

the
goddess
of

known
to
us
in
connection
with
the
aramæans
we
find
mention
made
of
her
by
the
hebrew
writers
and
geographical
names
such
as
and
prove
that
she
must
have
been
worshipped
at
a
very
early
date
in
the
canaanite
countries
anat

anaîti
or
aniti
has
been
found
in
a
phoenician
inscription
which
enables
us
to
reconstruct
the
history
of
the
goddess
her
worship
was
largely
practised
among
the
canaanites
as
is
proved
by
the
existence
in
the
hebrew
epoch
of
several
towns
such
as
anoth
anathôth
at
least
one
of
which
is
mentioned
in
the
egyptian
geographical
lists

appearance

known
to
us
as
she
is
represented
in
egyptian
dress
on
several
stelæ
of
the
xixth
and
xxth
dynasties
her
name
like
that
of

had
become
a
generic
term

plural
form

a
whole
group
of

at

on
a
stele
of

she
enters
into
the
composition

a
compound
name
perhaps
goddess
of
asiti
is
enflamed
with
anger
which
we
find
on
a
monument
in
the
vienna
museum
max
müller
makes
her
out
to
have
been
a
divinity
of
the
desert
and
the
place
in
which
the
picture
representing
her
was
found
would
seem
to
justify
this
hypothesis
the
egyptians
connected
her
as
well
as
the
other
astartês
with
owing
to
her
cruel
and
warlike
character

the
statues
sometimes
represent
her
as
a
sphinx
with
a
head

more
often
as
a
woman
standing
on
a
lion
passant
either
nude
or
encircled
round
the
hips
by
merely
a
girdle

hands
filled
with
flowers

with

features
framed
in
a
mass

heavy
tresses

faithful
type
of
the
priestesses
who
devoted
themselves
to
her
service
the
she
was
the
goddess
of
love
in
its
animal
or
rather
in
its
purely
physical
aspect
and
in
this
capacity
was
styled
qaddishat
the
holy
like
the
hetairæ
of
her
family
qodshu
the
amorite
capital
was
consecrated
to
her
service
and
she
was
there
associated
with
rashuf
the
qaddishat

know
to
us
from
the
egyptian
monuments
referred
to
above
the
name
was
sometimes
written
qodshû
like
that
of
the
town
de
bougé
argued
from
this
that
qaddishat
must
have
been
the
eponymous
divinity
of
qodshû
and
that
her
real
name
was
kashit
or
kesh
he
recalls
however
the
played
by
the
qedeshoth
and
admits
that
holy
here
means
the
but
she
often
comes
before
us
as
a
warlike
amazon
brandishing
a
club
lance
or
shield
mounted
on
horseback
like
a
soldier
and
wandering
through
the
desert
in
quest
of
her
prey
this
dual
temperament
rendered
her
a
goddess
of
uncertain
attributes
and
of
violent
contrasts
at
times
reserved
and
chaste
at
other
times
shameless
and
dissolute
but
always
cruel
always
barren
for
the
countless
multitude
of
her
excesses
for
ever
shut
her
out
from
motherhood
she
conceives
without
ceasing

never
brings
forth

a

popular
tale
preserved
in

to

this
conception
of
the
syrian
goddesses
had
already
become
firmly
established
at
the
period
with
which
we
are
dealing
for
an
egyptian
magical
formula
defines
anîti

as
great
goddesses

not

by

that

held
sacred

the

to
be

so
frequently
referred
to
by
the
hebrew
prophets
and
which
we
find
in
the
country
of
moab
according
to
the
mesha
inscription
and
in
the
many
of
them
seem
to
have
served
for
canaanitish
places
of
worship
before
they
were
resorted
to
by
the
children
of
israel
the
worship
of
these
gods
involved
the
performance
of
ceremonies
more
bloody
and
licentious
even
than
those
practised
by
other
races
the
baalim
thirsted
after
blood
nor
would
they
be
satisfied
with
any
common
blood
such
as
generally
contented
their
brethren
in
chaldæa
or
egypt
they
imperatively
demanded
human
as
well
as
animal
sacrifices
among
several
of
the
syrian
nations
they
had
a
prescriptive
right
to
the
firstborn
male
of
each
family
this
right
was
generally
commuted
either
by
a
money
payment
or
by
subjecting
the
infant
to
circumcision
this
fact
is
proved
in
so
far
as
the
hebrew
people
is
concerned
by
the
texts
of
the
pentateuch
and
of
the
prophets
amongst
the
moabites
also
it
was
his
eldest
son
whom
king
mosha
took
to
offer
to
his
god
we
find
the
same
custom
among
other
syrian
races
philo
of
byblos
tells
us
in
fact
that
god
of
byblos
sacrificed
his
firstborn
son
and
set
the
example
of
this
kind
of
offering
redemption
by
a
payment
in
money
was
the
case
among
the
hebrews
as
also
the
substitution
of
an
animal
in
the
place
of
a
child
as
to
redemption
by
circumcision
cf
the
story
of
moses
and
zipporah
where
the
mother
saves
her
son
from
jahveh
by
circumcising
him
circumcision
was
practised
among
the
syrians
of
palestine
in
the
time
of
herodotus
at
important
junctures
however
this
pretence
of
bloodshed
would
fail
to
appease
them
and
the
death
of
the
child
alone
availed
indeed
in
times
of
national
danger
the
king
and
nobles
would
furnish
not
merely
a
single
victim
but
as
many
as
the
priests
chose
to
demand
while
they
were
being
burnt
alive
on
the
knees
of
the
statue
or
before
the
sacred
emblem
their
cries
of
pain
were
drowned
by
the
piping
of
flutes
or
the
blare
of
trumpets
the
parents
standing
near
the
altar
without
a
sign
of
pity
and
dressed
as
for
a
festival
the
ruler
of
the
world
could
refuse
nothing
to
prayers
backed
by
so
precious
an
offering
and
by
a
purpose
so
determined
to
move
him
such
sacrifices
were
however
the
exception
and
the
shedding
of
their
own
blood
by
his
priests
sufficed
as
a
rule
for
the
daily
wants
of
the
god
seizing
their
knives
they
would
slash
their
arms
and
breasts
with
the
view
of
compelling
by
this
offering
of
their
own
persons
the
good
will
of
the
baalim
if
we
may
credit
tertullian
the
custom
of
offering
up
children
as
sacrifices
lasted
down
to
the
proconsulate
of
tiberius
for
the
hebraic
epoch
the
scene
where
the
priests
of
baal
in
a
trial
of
power
with
elijah
before
ahab
offered
up
sacrifices
on
the
highest
point
of
carmel
and
finding
that
their
offerings
did
not
meet
with
the
usual
success
themselves
with
knives
and
lancets
till
the
blood
gushed
out
upon
the
astartês
of
all
degrees
and
kinds
were
hardly
less
cruel
they
imposed
frequent
flagellations
and
sometimes
even
emasculation
on
their
devotees
around
the
majority
of
these
goddesses
was
gathered
an
infamous
troop
of
profligates
of
and
courtesans
the
temples
bore
little
resemblance
to
those
of
the
regions
of
the
lower
euphrates
nowhere
do
we
find
traces
of
those
which
serve
to
produce
the
peculiar
jagged
outline
characteristic
of
chaldæan
cities
the
syrian
edifices
were
stone
buildings
which
included
in
addition
to
the
halls
and
courts
reserved
for
religious
rites
for
the
priesthood
and
storehouses
for
provisions
though
not
to
be
compared
in
size
with
the
sanctuaries
of
thebes
they
yet
answered
the
purpose
of
strongholds
in
time
of
need
and
were
capable
of
resisting
the
attacks
of
a
victorious
foe
a
numerous
staff
consisting
of
priests
male
and
female
singers
porters
butchers
slaves
and
artisans
was
assigned
to
each
of
these
temples
here
the
god
was
accustomed
to
give
forth
his
oracles
either
by
the
voice
of
his
prophets
or
by
the
movement
of
his
statues
the
greater
number
of
the
festivals
celebrated
in
them
were
closely
connected
with
the
pastoral
and
agricultural
life
of
the
country
they
inaugurated
or
brought
to
a
close
the
principal
operations
of
the
year
the
sowing
of
seed
the
harvest
the
vintage
the
shearing
of
the
sheep
at
shechem
when
the
grapes
were
ripe
the
people
flocked
out
of
the
town
into
the
vineyards
returning
to
the
temple
for
religious
observances
and
sacred
banquets
when
the
fruit
had
been
trodden
in
the
winepress
the
story
of
abimelech
gives
us
some
idea
of
what
the
canaanite
temple
of
at
shechem
was
like
as
to
the
regular
organisation
of
we
possess
only
documents
of
a
comparatively
late
period
it
is
probable
that
the
vintage
festival
celebrated
at
shiloh
in
the
time
of
the
judges
dated
back
to
a
period
of
canaanite
history
prior
to
the
hebrew
invasion
to
the
time
of
the
egyptian
supremacy
in
times
of
extraordinary
distress
such
as
a
prolonged
drought
or
a
famine
the
priests
were
wont
to
ascend
in
solemn
procession
to
the
high
places
in
order
to
implore
the
pity
of
their
divine
masters
from
whom
they
strove
to
extort
help
or
to
obtain
the
rain
by
their
dances
their
lamentations
and
the
shedding
of
their
blood
in
the
hebraic
period
the
scene
where
the
priests
of
baal
go
up
to
the
top
of
mount
carmel
with
the
prophet
elijah
almost
everywhere
but
especially
in
the
regions
east
of
the
jordan
were
monuments
which
popular
piety
surrounded
with
a
superstitious
reverence
such
were
the
isolated
boulders
or
as
we
should
call
them
reared
on
the
summit
of
a
knoll
or
on
the
edge
of
a
tableland
dolmens
formed
of
a
flat
slab
placed
on
the
top
of
two
roughly
hewn
supports
cromlechs
or
that
is
to
say
stone
circles
in
the
centre
of
which
might
be
found
a
we
know
not
by
whom
were
set
up
these
monuments
there
nor
at
what
time
the
fact
that
they
are
in
no
way
different
from
those
which
are
to
be
met
with
in
western
europe
and
the
north
of
africa
has
given
rise
to
the
theory
that
they
were
the
work
of
some
one
primeval
race
which
wandered
ceaselessly
over
the
ancient
world
a
few
of
them
may
have
marked
the
tombs
of
some
forgotten
personages
the
discovery
of
human
bones
beneath
them
confirming
such
a
conjecture
while
others
seem
to
have
been
holy
places
and
altars
from
the
beginning
the
nations
of
syria
did
not
in
all
cases
recognise
the
original
purpose
of
these
monuments
but
regarded
them
as
marking
the
seat
of
an
ancient
divinity
or
the
precise
spot
on
which
he
had
at
some
time
manifested
himself
when
the
children
of
israel
caught
sight
of
them
again
on
their
return
from
egypt
they
at
once
recognised
in
them
the
work
of
their
patriarchs
the
dolmen
at
shechem
was
the
altar
which
abraham
had
built
to
the
eternal
after
his
arrival
in
the
country
of
canaan
isaac
had
raised
that
at
beersheba
on
the
very
spot
where
jehovah
had
appeared
in
order
to
renew
with
him
the
covenant
that
he
had
made
with
abraham
one
might
almost
reconstruct
a
map
of
the
wanderings
of
jacob
from
the
altars
which
he
built
at
each
of
his
principal
at
gilead
galeed
at
ephrata
at
bethel
and
at
shechem
each
of
such
still
existing
objects
probably
had
a
history
of
its
own
connecting
it
inseparably
with
some
event
in
the
local
annals
the
heap
of
stones
at
galeed
in
aramaic
heap
of
witness
marked
the
spot
where
laban
and
jacob
were
reconciled
the

the
way
to
ephrata

tomb
of

worship
they
were

were

the

at
times

jacob
rested
his
head
on

night
in

jehovah
appeared

him
in
a
dream
in
phoenicia
there
was
a
legend
which
told
how
usôos
set
up
two
stellæ
to
the
elements

wind
and
fire
and
how
he
offered
the
blood
of
the
animals

had
killed
in
the
chase
as
a
libation
men
and
beasts
were
supposed
to
be
animated
during
their
lifetime
by
a
breath
or
soul
which
ran
in
their
veins
along
with
their
blood
and
served
to
move
their
limbs
the
man
therefore
who
drank
blood
or
ate
bleeding
flesh
assimilated
thereby
the
soul
which
inhered
in
it
after
death
the
fate
of
this
soul
was
similar
to
that
ascribed
to
the
spirits
of
the
departed
in
egypt
and
chaldæa
the
inhabitants
of
the
ancient
world
were
always
accustomed
to
regard
the
surviving
element
in
man
as
something
restless
and
unhappy
a
weak
and
pitiable
double
doomed
to
hopeless
destruction
if
deprived
of
the
succour
of
the
living
they
imagined
it
as
taking
up
its
abode
near
the
body
wrapped
in
a
lethargy
or
else
as
dwelling
with
the
other
departed
spirits
in
some
dismal
and
gloomy
kingdom
hidden
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth

chaldæan
allât

palestine

it
wasted
away
a
prey

sullen
melancholy

the
sway

inexorable
deities

idea

of

date

fix

do
we
meet

which
after
the
vicissitudes

thirty
centuries
still
retain
something
of

the
necropolis

adlûn
the
last
rearrangement
of
which

period
but
which
externally
bears
so
strong
a
resemblance
to
an
egyptian
necropolis
of
the
xviiith
or
xixth
dynasty
that
we
may
without
violating
the
probabilities
trace
its
origin
back
to
the
time
of
the
pharaonic
conquest
in
this
case
the
doors
were
placed
in
rows
on
a
sort
of
façade
similar
to
that
of
the
egyptian
generally
without
any

were
not

funeral

all

forbidden

they
were
again
required
for
the
purposes

on
these
occasions
of
sad
necessity
those
whom
mouth
of

had
dreaded
the
visits
of
the
living
and
resorted
to
every
means
afforded
by
their
religion
to
protect
themselves
from
them
their
inscriptions
declare
repeatedly
that
neither
gold
nor
silver
nor
any
object
which
could
excite
the
greed
of
robbers
was
to
be
found
within
their
graves

threaten
any
one
who
should
dare
to
deprive
them
of
such
articles
of
little
value
as
belonged
to
them

to
turn
them
out
of
their
chambers
in
order
to
make
room
for
others
with
all
sorts
of
vengeance
divine
and
human
these
imprecations
have
not
however
availed
to
save
them
from
the
desecration
the
danger
of
which
they
foresaw
and
there
are
few
of
their
tombs
which
were
not
occupied
by
a
succession
of
tenants

therefore
must
have
exercised
influence
on
individual
syrians
and
on
their
belief

although
we
are
forced
to
allow
the
existence
of
such
influence
we
can
not
define
precisely
the
effects
produced
by
it
only
on
the
coast
and
in
the
phoenician
cities
do
the
local
religions
seem
to
have
become
formulated
at
a
fairly
early
date
and
crystallised
under
pressure
of
this
influence
into
cosmogonie

creator
of

though
the
character
of

him

him
as
lord
of
the

to
put
an
end
to
their

it
was
thought
that
chaos
existed
at
the
beginning
but
chaos
of
a
dark
and

nature
over
which
a
breath
floated
without
affecting
it
this
chaos
had
no
ending
and
it
was
thus
for
centuries
and
then
the
breath
became
enamoured
of
its
own
principles
and
brought
about
a
change
in
itself
and
this
change
was
called
desire
now
desire
was
the
principle
which
created
all
things
and
the
breath
knew
not
its
own
the
breath
and
chaos
therefore
became
united

the
clay
was
born

from
this
clay
sprang
all
the
seed
of
creation

classed
the
temple

byblos
among
the
phoenician
temples
of
the
old
order
which
were
almost
as
ancient
as
the
temples

egypt

it
is
probable
that
from
the
egyptian
epoch
onwards
the
plan
of
this
temple
must
have
been
that
shown
on
the
coins
the
cloister
arcades
ought
however
to
be
represented
by
pillars
or
by
columns
supporting
architraves
and
the
fact
of
their
presence
leads
me
to
the
conclusion
that
the
temple
did
not
exist
in
the
form
known
to
us
at
a
date
earlier

he
burnt
his

on
the

as
an
expiatory
victim

from
that
time
forward
the

took
advantage

then
her
grief
triumphed

ransomed
by

rose
from
the
tomb
his
love
no

less
passionate
than
it
had
been
before
the

this
is
nothing
else
than
the
chaldæan
legend
of
ishtar
and
dûmûzi
presented
in
a
form
more
fully
symbolical
of
the
yearly
marriage

the

of
this
legend
from
the
very
earliest
times
we
know
the
precise
spot
where
the
goddess
first
caught
sight
of
her
lover
where
she
unveiled
herself
before
him
and
where
at
the
last
she
buried
his
mutilated
body
and
chanted
her
lament
for
the
dead
a
river
which
flows
southward
not
far
off

called
the
adonis
and
the
valley
watered
by
it
was
supposed
to
have
been
the
scene
of
this
tragic
idyll
the

near
aphaka
at
the
base
of
a
narrow
amphitheatre
issuing
from
the
entrance
of
an
irregular
grotto

shape
of
which
had
at
some
remote
period
been
altered
by
the
hand
of
man

three
cascades
it
bounds
into
a
sort
of
circular
basin
where
it
gathers
to
itself
the
waters
of
the
neighbouring
springs
then
it
dashes
onwards
under
the
single
arch
of
a
roman
bridge

descends
in
a
series
of
waterfalls

indeed
there
must
have
been
as
many
different
traditions
on
the
subject
as
there
were
celebrated
sanctuaries
at
the
summer
solstice
the
season
when
the
wild
boar
had
ripped
open
the
divine
hunter
and
the
summer
had
already
done
damage
to

the
priests
were
accustomed
to
prepare
a
painted
wooden
image
of
a
corpse
made
ready
for
burial
which
they
hid
in
what
were
called
the
gardens
of
adonis
pots
filled
with
earth
in
which
wheat
and
barley
lettuce
and
fennel
were
sown
these
were
set
out
at
the
door
of

house

in

courts
of

the
sprouting
plants
had
to

scorching
effect

shorn
their
garments
in
rags
their
faces
torn
with
their
nails
their
breasts
and
arms
scarified
with
knives
went
about
over
hill
and
dale
in
search
of
their
idol
giving
utterance
to
cries
of
despair
and
to
endless
appeals
lord
ah
lord
what
is
become
of
thy
once
having
found
the
image
they
brought
it
to
the
feet
of
the

washed
it
while
displaying
its
wound
anointed
it
with
unguents
wrapped
it
in

shroud
placed
it
on
a
catafalque
and
after
expressing
around
the
bier
their
feelings
of
desolation
according
to
the
rites
observed
at
fanerais
placed
it
solemnly
in
the
tomb
theocritus
has
described
in
his
fifth
idyll
the
laying
out
and
burial
of
adonis
as
it
was
practised
at
alexandria
in
egypt
in
the
iiird
century
before
our
era
the
close
and
dreary
summer
passes
away
with
the
first
days
of

autumnal
rains
begin
to
fall
upon

hills
and
washing
away
the
ochreous
earth
lying
upon
the
slopes
descend
in
muddy
torrents
into
the
hollows
of
the
valleys
the
adonis
river
begins
to
swell
with
the
ruddy
waters
which
on
reaching
the
sea
do
not
readily
blend
with
it
the
wind
from
the
offing
drives
the
river
water
back
upon
the
coast
and
forces
it
to
cling
for
a
long
time
to
the
shore
where
it
forms
a
kind
of
crimson
fringe
this
was
the
blood
of
the
hero
and
the
sight
of
this
precious
stream
stirred
up
anew
the
devotion
of
the
people
who
donned
once
more
their
weeds
of
mourning
until
the
priests
were
able
to
announce
to
them
that
by
virtue
of
their
supplications
adonis
was
brought
back
from
the
shades
into
new
life
shouts
of
joy
immediately
broke
forth
and
the
people
who
had
lately
sympathized
with
the
mourning
goddess
in
her
tears
and
cries
of
sorrow
now
joined
with
her
in
expressions
of
mad
and
amorous
delight
wives
and
virgins
all
the
women
who
had
refused
during
the
week
of
mourning
to
make
a
sacrifice
of
their
hair
were
obliged
to
atone
for
this
fault
by
putting
themselves
at
the
disposal
of
the
strangers
whom
the
festival
had
brought
together
the
reward
of
their
service
becoming
the
property
of
the
sacred
treasury
the
same
phenomenon

in

it
on

the

berytus

found
by
hincks
in
the
egyptian
texts
under
the
form
bîrutu
beîrutu
it
occurs
frequently
in
the
tel

the

lykos
runs
like
a

of
natural
fosse
along

steep
headland
it
forms
at
the
present
time
a
torrent
fed
by
the
melting
snows
of
mount
sannin
and
is
entirely
unnavigable
it
was
better
circumstanced
formerly
in
this
respect
and
even
in
the
early
years
of
the
boman
conquest
sailors
from
arvad
arados
were
accustomed
to
sail
up
it
as
far
as
one
of
the
passes
of

lebanon
leading
into
berytus
was
installed
at
the
base
of
a
great
headland
which
stands
out
boldly
into

and
forms
the
most
striking
promontory
to
be
met
with
in
these
regions
from

to
the
vicinity
of
arvad
the
port
is
nothing
but
an
open
creek
with
a
petty
roadstead
but
it
has
the
advantage
of
a
good
supply
of
fresh
water
which
pours
down
from
the
numerous
springs
to
which
it
is

for
its
name
according
to
ancient
legends
it
was
given
by
el
to
one
of
his
offspring
called
poseidon
by
the
greeks
the
name
beyrut
has
been
often
derived
from
a
phconician
word
signifying

which
may
have
been
applied
to
the
pine

the
phoenicians
themselves
derived
it
from

desired
to
take
possession
of

frustrated
in

the

of
the

extended
as
far
as
the

an
old
legend
narrates
that
its
patron
fought
in
ancient
times
with
the
deity
of
that
river

stones
at
him
to
prevent
his
becoming

north
the
bar
formed
of

and
the
dunes
which
contract
the
entrance
were
regarded
as
evidences
of
this
conflict
the
poet
nonnus
has
preserved
a
highly
embellished
account
of
this
rivalry
where
adonis
is
called
dionysos
the
original
name
appears
to
have
been
tamur

remote

six

hundred

less
than
that
of

course

it
was
as
effective
as
a
broader
channel
to
stop
the
movement
of
an
army
a
fleet
alone
would
have
a
chance
of
taking
the
city
by
surprise
or
of
capturing
it
after
a
lengthened
siege
according
to
the
writers
who
were
contemporary
with
alexander
the
strait
was
stadia
wide
nearly
mile
or
paces
about
mile
at
the
period
when
the
macedonians
undertook
the
siege
of

the

renan
thinks
the

be
nearly
a

we
should
perhaps
do
well
to
reduce

over

the
phoenicians
took
naturally
to
agriculture
and
carried
it
to
such
a
high
state
of
perfection
as
to
make
it
an
actual
science
to
which
the
neighbouring
peoples
of
the
mediterranean
were
glad
to
accommodate
their
modes
of
culture
in
later
times
their
taste
for
agriculture
and
the
comparative
perfection
of
their
modes
of
culture
are
proved
by
the
greatness
of
the
remains
still
to
be
observed
phoenicians
constructed
a
winepress
a
trough
to
last
for
their
colonists
at
carthage
carried
with
them
the
same
clever
methods
and
the
romans
borrowed
many
excellent
things
in
the
way
of
agriculture
from
carthaginian
books
especially
from
those
of
mago
among
no
other
people
was
the
art
of
irrigation
so
successfully
practised
and
from
such
a
narrow
strip
of
territory
as
belonged
to
them
no
other
cultivators
could
have
gathered
such
abundant
harvests
of
wheat
and
barley
and
such
supplies
of
grapes
olives
and
other
fruits
from
arvad
to
tyre
and
even
beyond
it
the
littoral
region
and
the
central
parts
of
the
valleys
presented
a
long
ribbon
of
verdure
of
varying
breadth
where
fields
of
corn
were
blended
with
gardens
and
orchards
and
shady
woods
the
whole
region
was
independent
and
the
inhabitants
having
no
need
to
address
themselves
to
their
neighbours
in
the
interior
or
to
send
their
children
to
seek
their
fortune
in
distant
lands
to
insure
prosperity
nothing
was
needed
but
a
slight
exercise
of
labour
and
freedom
from
the
devastating
influence
of
war
the
position
of
the
country
was
such
as
to
secure
it
from
attack
and
from
the
conflicts
which
laid
waste
the
rest
of
syria
along
almost
the
entire
eastern
border
of
the
country
the
lebanon
was
a
great
wall
of
defence
running
parallel
to
the
coast
strengthened
at
each
extremity
by
the
additional
protection
of
the
rivers
nahr
and
litany
its
slopes
were
further
defended
by
the
forest
which
with
its
lofty
trees
and
brushwood
added
yet
another
barrier
to
that
afforded
by
rocks
and
snow
or
paths
led
here
and
there
in
tortuous
courses
from
one
side
of
the
mountain
to
the
other
near
the
middle
of
the
country
two
roads
practicable
in
all
seasons
secured
communications
between
the
littoral
and
the
plain
of
the
interior
they
branched
off
on
either
side
from
the
central
road
in
the
neighbourhood
of
tabakhi
south
of
qodshu
and
served
the
needs
of
the
wooded
province
of
magara
this
region
was
inhabited
by
pillaging
tribes
which
the
egyptians
called
at
one
time
lamnana
the
libanites
at
others
shausu
using
for
them
the
same
appellation
as
that
which
they
bestowed
upon
the
bedouin
of
the
desert
magara
is
mentioned
in
the

chabas
has
identified
it
with
the
plain
of
macra
which
strabo
places
in
syria
in
the
neighbourhood
of
eloutheros
the
name
lamnana
is
given
in
a
picture
of
the
campaigns
of
seti
i
the
roads
through
this
province
ran
under
the
dense
shade
afforded
by
oaks
cedars
and
cypresses
in
an
obscurity
favourable
to
the
habits
of
the
wolves
and
hyamas
which
infested
it
and
even
of
those
lions
known
to
asia
at
the
time
and
then
proceeding
in
its
course
crossed
the
ridge
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
called
shaua
which
is
probably
the
sannîn
of
our
times
while
one
of
these
roads
running
north
along
the
lake
of
yamuneh
and
through
the
gorge
of
akura
then
proceeded
along
the
to
byblos
the
other
took
a
southern
direction
and
followed
the
nahr
to
the
sea
this
is
the
road
pointed
out
by
renan
as
the
easiest
but
least
known
of
those
which
cross
the
lebanon
the
remains
of
an
assyrian
inscription
graven
on
the
rocks
near
aîn
asafîr
show
that
it
was
employed
from
a
very
early
date
and
renan
thought
that
it
was
used
by
the
armies
which
came
from
the
upper
valley
of
the
orontes
towards
the
mouth
of
the
latter
a
wall
of
rock
opposes
the
progress
of
the
river
and
leaves
at
length
but
a
narrow
and
precipitous
defile
for
the
passage
of
its
waters
a
pathway
cut
into
the
cliff
at
a
very
remote
date
leads
almost
perpendicularly
from
the
bottom
of
the
precipice
to
the
summit
of
the
promontory
commerce
followed
these
short
and
direct
routes
but
invading
hosts
very
rarely
took
advantage
of
them
although
they
offered
access
into
the
very
heart
of
phoenicia
invaders
would
encounter
here
in
fact
a
little
known
and
broken
country
lending
itself
readily
to
surprises
and
ambuscades
and
should
they
reach
the
foot
of
the
lebanon
range
they
would
find
themselves
entrapped
in
a
region
of
slippery
defiles
with
steep
paths
at
intervals
cut
into
the
rock
and
almost
inaccessible
to
chariots
or
horses
and
so
narrow
in
places
that
a
handful
of
resolute
men
could
have
held
them
for
a
long
time
against
whole
battalions
the
enemy
preferred
to
make
for
the
two
natural
breaches
at
the
respective
extremities
of
the
line
of
defence
and
for
the
two
insular
cities
which
flanked
the
approaches
to
them
tyre
in
the
case
of
those
coming
from
egypt
arvad
and
simyra
for
assailants
from
the
euphrates
the
arvadians
bellicose
by
nature
would
offer
strong
resistance
to
the
invader
and
not
permit
themselves
to
be
conquered
without
a
brave
struggle
with
the
enemy
however
powerful
he
might
be
when
the
disproportion
of
the
forces
which
they
could
muster
against
the
enemy
convinced
them
of
the
folly
of
attempting
an
open
conflict
their
offered
them
a
refuge
where
they
would
be
safe
from
any
attacks
thûtmosis
iii
was
obliged
to
enter
on
a
campaign
against
arvad
in
the
year
in
the
year
and
probably
twice
in
the
following
years
under
amenôthes
iii
and
iv
we
see
that
these
people
took
part
in
all
the
intrigues
directed
against
egypt
they
were
the
allies
of
the
khati
against
ramses
ii
in
the
campaign
of
the
year
and
later
on
we
find
them
involved
in
most
of
the
wars
against
assyria
sometimes
the
burning
and
pillaging
of
their
property
on
the
mainland
might
reduce
them
to
throw
themselves
on
the
mercy
of
their
foes
but
such
submission
did
not
last
long
and
they
welcomed
the
slightest
occasion
for
regaining
their
liberty
conquered
again
and
again
on
account
of
the
smallness
of
their
numbers
they
were
never
discouraged
by
their
reverses
and
phoenicia
owed
all
its
military
history
for
a
long
period
to
their
prowess
the
tyrians
were
of
a
more
accommodating
nature
and
there
is
no
evidence
at
least
during
the
early
centuries
of
their
existence
of
the
display
of
those
obstinate
and
blind
transports
of
bravery
by
which
the
arvadians
were
carried
away
no
campaign
against
tyre
is
mentioned
in
any
of
the
egyptian
annals
the
expedition
of
thûtmosis
iii
against
senzauru
was
directed
against
a
town
of
mentioned
in
the
tel
tablets
with
the
orthography
zinzar
the
of
times
the
shaizar
of
the
arab
chronicles
on
the
contrary
the
tel
tablets
contain
several
passages
which
manifest
the
fidelity
of
tyre
and
its
governors
to
the
king
of
egypt
their
foreign
policy
was
reduced
to
a
simple
arithmetical
question
which
they
discussed
in
the
light
of
their
industrial
or
commercial
interests
as
soon
as
they
had
learned
from
a
short
experience
that
a
certain
pharaoh
had
at
his
disposal
armies
against
which
they
could
offer
no
serious
opposition
they
at
once
surrendered
to
him
and
thought
only
of
obtaining
the
greatest
profit
from
the
vassalage
to
which
they
were
condemned
the
obligation
to
pay
tribute
did
not
appear
to
them
so
much
in
the
light
of
a
burthen
or
a
sacrifice
as
a
means
of
purchasing
the
right
to
go
to
and
fro
freely
in
egypt
or
in
the
countries
subject
to
its
influence
the
commerce
acquired
by
these
privileges
recouped
them
more
than
a
hundredfold
for
all
that
their
overlord
demanded
from
them
the
other
cities
of
the
coast
sidon
berytus
byblos
usually
followed
the
example
of
tyre
whether
from
mercenary
motives
or
from
their
naturally
pacific
disposition
or
from
a
sense
of
their
impotence
and
the
same
intelligent
resignation
with
which
as
we
know
they
accepted
the
supremacy
of
the
great
egyptian
empire
was
doubtless
displayed
in
earlier
centuries
in
their
submission
to
the
babylonians
their
records
show
that
they
did
not
accept
this
state
of
things
merely
through
cowardice
or
indolence
for
they
are
represented
as
ready
to
rebel
and
shake
off
the
yoke
of
their
foreign
master
when
they
found
it
incompatible
with
their
practical
interests
but
their
resort
to
war
was
exceptional
they
generally
preferred
to
submit
to
the
powers
that
be
and
to
accept
from
them
as
if
on
lease
the
strip
of
at
the
base
of
the
lebanon
which
served
as
a
site
for
their
warehouses
and
dockyards
thus
they
did
not
find
the
yoke
of
the
stranger
irksome
the
sea
opening
up
to
them
a
realm
of
freedom
and
independence
which
compensated
them
for
the
limitations
of
both
territory
and
liberty
imposed
upon
them
at
home
the
epoch
which
was
marked
by
their
first
venture
on
the
mediterranean
and
the
motives
which
led
to
it
were
alike
unknown
to
them
the
gods
had
taught
them
navigation
and
from
the
beginning
of
things
they
had
taken
to
the
sea
as
fishermen
or
as
explorers
in
search
of
new
lands
they
were
not
driven
by
poverty
to
leave
their
continental
abode
or
inspired
thereby
with
a
zeal
for
distant
cruises
they
had
at
home
sufficient
corn
and
wine
oil
and
fruits
to
meet
all
their
needs
and
even
to
administer
to
a
life
of
luxury
and
if
they
lacked
cattle
the
abundance
of
fish
within
their
reach
compensated
for
the
absence
of
according
to
one
of
the
cosmogonies
of
sanchoniathon
khusôr
who
has
been
identified
with
hephsestos
was
the
inventor
of
the

was
the
first
among
men
and
gods
who
taught
navigation
according
to
another
legend
melkarth
showed
the
tyrians
how
to
make
a
raft
from
the
branches
of
a
fig
tree
while
the
construction
of
the
first
ships
is
elsewhere
ascribed
to
the
nor
was
it
the
number
of
commodiously
situated
ports
on
their
coast
which
induced
them
to
become
a
seafaring
people
for
their
harbours
were
badly
protected
for
the
most
part
and
offered
no
shelter
when
the
wind
set
in
from
the
north
the
rugged
shore
presenting
little
resource
against
the
wind
and
waves
in
its
narrow
and
shallow
havens
it
was
the
nature
of
the
country
itself
which
contributed
more
than
anything
else
to
make
them
mariners
the
precipitous
mountain
masses
which
separate
one
valley
from
another
rendered
communication
between
them
difficult
while
they
served
also
as
for
robbers
commerce
endeavoured
to
follow
therefore
the
in
preference
to
the
devious
ways
of
this
region
and
it
accomplished
its
purpose
the
more
readily
because
the
common
occupation
of
had
familiarised
the
people
with
every
nook
and
corner
on
the
coast
the
continual
wash
of
the
surge
had
worn
away
the
bases
of
the
limestone
cliffs
and
the
superincumbent
masses
tumbling
down
into
the
sea
formed
lines
of
rocks
hardly
rising
above
the
which
fringed
the
headlands
with
perilous
reefs
against
which
the
waves
broke
continuously
at
the
slightest
wind
it
required
some
bravery
to
approach
them
and
no
little
skill
to
steer
one
of
the
frail
boats
which
these
people
were
accustomed
to
employ
from
the
earliest
times
scatheless
amid
the
breakers
the
coasting
trade
was
attracted
from
arvad
successively
to
berytus
sidon
and
tyre
and
finally
to
the
other
towns
of
the
coast
it
was
in
full
operation
doubtless
from
the
vith
egyptian
dynasty
onwards
when
the
pharaohs
no
longer
hesitated
to
embark
troops
at
the
mouth
of
the
nile
for
speedy
transmission
to
the
provinces
of
southern
syria
and
it
was
by
this
coasting
route
that
the
tin
and
amber
of
the
north
succeeded
in
reaching
the
interior
of
egypt
the
trade
was
originally
it
would
seem
in
the
hands
of
those
mysterious
kefâtiu
of
whom
the
name
only
was
known
in
later
times
when
the
phoenicians
established
themselves
at
the
foot
of
the
lebanon
they
had
probably
only
to
take
the
place
of
their
predecessors
and
to
follow
the
beaten
tracks
which
they
had
already
made
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
they
took
to
a
seafaring
life
soon
after
their
arrival
in
the
country
and
that
they
adapted
themselves
and
their
civilization
readily
to
the
exigencies
of
a
maritime
career
connexion
between
phoenicia
and
greece
was
fully
established
at
the
outbreak
of
the
egyptian
wars
and
we
may
safely
assume
their
existence
in
the
centuries
immediately
preceding
the
second
millennium
before
our
era
in
their
towns
as
in
most
there
was
a
considerable
foreign
element
both
of
slaves
and
freemen
but
the
egyptians
confounded
them
all
under
one
name
kefâtiu
whether
they
were
cypriotes
asiatics
or
europeans
or
belonged
to
the
true
tyrian
and
sidonian
race
the
costume
of
the
kafîti
was
similar
to
that
worn
by
the
people
of
the
interior
the
with
or
without
a
long
upper
garment
while
in
tiring
the
hair
they
adopted
certain
refinements
specially
a
series
of
curls
which
the
men
arranged
in
the
form
of
an
aigrette
above
their
foreheads
this
motley
collection
of
races
was
ruled
over
by
an
oligarchy
of
merchants
and
shipowners
whose
functions
were
hereditary
and
who
usually
paid
homage
to
a
single
king
the
representative
of
the
tutelary
god
and
absolute
master
of
the
city
under
the
egyptian
supremacy
the
local
princes
did
not
assume
the
royal
title
in
the
despatches
which
they
addressed
to
the
kings
of
egypt
but
styled
themselves
governors
of
their
cities
the
industries
pursued
in
phoenicia
were
somewhat
similar
to
those
of
other
parts
of
syria
the
stuffs
vases
and
ornaments
made
at
tyre
and
sidon
could
not
be
distinguished
from
those
of
hamath
or
of
carchemish
illustration
one
of
the
kafîti
from
the
tomb
of
rakhmirî
drawn
by
from
the
coloured
sketches
by
prisse
in
the
natural
hist
museum
all
manufactures
bore
the
impress
of
babylonian
influence
and
their
implements
weights
measures
and
system
of
exchange
were
the
same
as
those
in
use
among
the
chaldæans
the
products
of
the
country
were
however
not
sufficient
to
freight
the
fleets
which
sailed
from
phoenicia
every
year
bound
for
all
parts
of
the
known
world
and
additional
supplies
had
to
be
regularly
obtained
from
neighbouring
peoples
who
thus
became
used
to
pour
into
tyre
and
sidon
the
surplus
of
their
manufactures
or
of
the
natural
wealth
of
their
country
the
phoenicians
were
also
accustomed
to
send
caravans
into
regions
which
they
could
not
reach
in
their
caracks
and
to
establish
trading
stations
at
the
fords
of
rivers
or
in
the
passes
over
mountain
ranges
we
know
of
the
existence
of
such
emporia
at
laish
near
the
sources
of
the
jordan
at
thapsacus
and
at
nisibis
and
they
must
have
served
the
purpose
of
a
series
of
posts
on
the
great
highways
of
the
world
the
settlements
of
the
phoenicians
always
assumed
the
character
of
colonies
and
however
remote
they
might
be
from
their
fatherland
the
colonists
never
lost
the
manners
and
customs
of
their
native
country
they
collected
together
into
their
or
storehouses
such
wares
and
commodities
as
they
could
purchase
in
their
new
localities
and
transmitting
them
periodically
to
the
coast
shipped
them
thence
to
all
parts
of
the
world
not
only
were
they
acquainted
with
every
part
of
the
mediterranean
but
they
had
even
made
voyages
beyond
its
limits
in
the
absence
however
of
any
specific
records
of
their
naval
enterprise
the
routes
they
followed
must
be
a
subject
of
conjecture
they
were
accustomed
to
relate
that
the
gods
after
having
instructed
them
in
the
art
of
navigation
had
shown
them
the
way
to

and
dying
in
the

of
illyria
in
short
wherever
the
phoenicians
had
obtained
a
footing
their
audacious
activity
made
such
an
indelible
impression
upon
the
mind
of
the
native
inhabitants
that
they
never
forgot
those
vigorous
men
with
pale
faces
and
dark
beards
and
soft
and
specious
speech
who
appeared
at
intervals
in
their
large
and
swift
sailing
vessels
they
made
their
way
cautiously
along
the
coast
usually
keeping
in
sight
of
land
making
sail
when
the
wind
was
favourable
or
taking
to
the
oars
for
days
together
when

demanded
it
anchoring
at
night
under
the
shelter
of
some
headland
or
in
bad
weather
hauling
their
vessels
up
the
beach
until
the
morrow
they
did
not
shrink
when
it
was
necessary
from
trusting
themselves
to
the
open
sea
directing
their
course
by
the
in
this
manner
they
often
traversed
long
distances
out
of
sight
of
land
and
they
succeeded
in
making
in
a
short
time
voyages
previously
deemed
long
and
costly
the
greeks
for
this
reason
called
it
phonikê
the
phoenician
star
ancient
writers
refer
to
the
use
which
the
phoenicians
made
of
the
to
guide
them
in
navigation
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
they
were
as
much
merchants
as
pirates
indeed
they
hardly
knew
themselves
and
their
peaceful
or
warlike
attitude
towards
vessels
which
they
encountered
on
the
seas
or
towards
the
people
whose
countries
they
frequented
was
probably
determined
by
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
if
on
arrival
at
a
port
they
felt
themselves
no
match
for
the
natives
the
instinct
of
the
merchant
prevailed
and
that
of
the
pirate
was
kept
in
the
background
they
landed
peaceably
gained
the
good
will
of
the
native
chief
and
his
nobles
by
small
presents
and
spreading
out
their
wares
contented
themselves
if
they
could
do
no
better
with
the
usual
advantage
obtained
in
an
exchange
of
goods
the
manner
in
which
the
phoenicians
plied
their
trade
is
strikingly
described
in
the
in
the
part
where
eumaios
relates
how
he
was
carried
off
by
a
sidonian
vessel
and
sold
as
a
slave
cf
the
passage
which
mentions
the
ravages
of
the
greeks
on
the
coast
of
the
delta
herodotus
recalls
the
rape
of
io
daughter
of
inachos
by
the
phoenicians
who
carried
her
and
her
companions
into
egypt
on
the
other
hand
during
one
of
their
egyptian
expeditions
they
had
taken
two
priestesses
from
thebes
and
had
transported
one
of
them
to
dodona
the
other
into
libya
they
were
never
in
a
hurry
and
would
remain
in
one
spot
until
they
had
exhausted
all
the
resources
of
the
country
while
they
knew
to
a
nicety
how
to
display
their
goods
attractively
before
the
expected
customer
their
wares
comprised
weapons
and
ornaments
for
men
axes
swords
incised
or
damascened
daggers
with
hilts
of
gold
or
ivory
bracelets
necklaces
amulets
of
all
kinds
enamelled
vases
stuffs
dyed
purple
or
embroidered
with
gay
colours
at
times
the
natives
whose
cupidity
was
excited
by
the
exhibition
of
such
valuables
would
attempt
to
gain
possession
of
them
either
by
craft
or
by
violence
they
would
kill
the
men
who
had
landed
or
attempt
to
surprise
the
vessel
during
the
night
but
more
often
it
was
the
phoenicians
who
took
advantage
of
the
friendliness
or
the
weakness
of
their
hosts

they
would
turn
treacherously
upon
the
unarmed
crowd
when
absorbed
in
the
interest
of
buying
and
selling
robbing
and
killing
the
old
men
they
would
make
prisoners
of
the
young
and
strong
the
women
and
children
carrying
them
off
to
sell
them
in
those
markets
where
slaves
were
known
to
fetch
the
highest
price
this
was
a
recognised
trade
but
it
exposed
the
phoenicians
to
the
danger
of
reprisals
and
made
them
objects
of
an
undying
hatred
when
on
these
distant
expeditions
they
were
subject
to
trivial
disasters
which
might
lead
to
serious
consequences
a
mast
might
break
an
oar
might
damage
a
portion
of
the
bulwarks
a
storm
might
force
them
to
throw
overboard
part
of
their
cargo
or
their
provisions
in
such
predicaments
they
had
no
means
of
repairing
the
damage
and
unable
to
obtain
help
in
any
of
the
places
they
might
visit
their
prospects
were
of
a
desperate
character
they
soon
therefore
learned
the
necessity
of
establishing
cities
of
refuge
at
various
points
in
the
countries
with
which
they
traded
stations
where
they
could
go
to
refit
and
revictual
their
vessels
to
fill
up
the
complement
of
their
crews
to
take
in
new
freight
and
if
necessary
pass
the
winter
or
wait
for
fair
weather
before
continuing
their
voyage
for
this
purpose
they
chose
by
preference
islands
lying
within
easy
distance
of
the
mainland
like
their
native
cities
of
tyre
and
arvad
but
possessing
a
good
harbour
or
roadstead
if
an
island
were
not
available
they
selected
a
peninsula
with
a
narrow
isthmus
or
a
rock
standing
at
the
extremity
of
a
promontory
which
a
handful
of
men
could
defend
against
any
attack
and
which
could
be
seen
from
a
considerable
distance
by
their
pilots
most
of
their
stations
thus
happily
situated
became
at
length
important
towns
they
were
frequented
by
the
natives
from
the
interior
who
allied
themselves
with
the
and
furnished
them
not
only
with
objects
of
trade
but
with
soldiers
sailors
and
recruits
for
their
army
and
such
was
the
rapid
spread
of
these
colonies
that
before
long
the
mediterranean
was
surrounded
by
an
almost
unbroken
chain
of
phoenician
strongholds
and
trading
stations

we
have
no
direct
information
from
any
existing
monument
to
show
us
what
these
vessels
were
like
but
we
are
familiar
with
the
construction
of
the
galleys
which
formed
the
fleets
of
the
pharaohs
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
the
art
of
shipbuilding
had
made
considerable
progress
since
the
times
of
the
memphite
kings
prom
the
period
when
egypt
aspired
to
become
one
of
the
great
powers
of
the
world
she
doubtless
endeavoured
to
bring
her
naval
force
to
the
same
pitch
of
perfection
as
her
land
forces
could
boast
of
and
her
fleets
probably
consisted
of
the
best
vessels
which
the
dockyards
of
that
day
could
turn
out
phoenician
vessels
of
this
period
may
therefore
be
regarded
with
reason
as
constructed
on
lines
similar
to
those
of
the
egyptian
ships
differing
from
them
merely
in
the
minor
details
of
the
shape
of
the
hull
and
manner
of
rigging
the
hull
continued
to
be
built
long
and
narrow
rising
at
the
stem
and
stern
the
bow
was
terminated
by
a
sort
of
hook
to
which
in
time
of
peace
a
bronze
ornament
was
attached
fashioned
to
represent
the
head
of
a
divinity
gazelle
or
bull
while
in
time
of
war
this
was
superseded
by
a
metal
made
fast
to
the
hull
by
several
turns
of
stout
rope
the
blade
rising
some
couple
of
yards
above
the
level
of
the
deck
the
poop
was
ornamented
with
a
projection
firmly
attached
to
the
body
of
the
vessel
but
curved
inwards
and
terminated
by
an
open
an
upper
deck
surrounded
by
a
wooden
rail
was
placed
at
the
bow
and
stern
to
serve
as
forecastle
and
quarterdecks
respectively
and
in
order
to
protect
the
vessel
from
the
danger
of
heavy
seas
the
ship
was
strengthened
by
a
structure
to
which
we
find
nothing
analogous
in
the
shipbuilding
of
classical
times
an
enormous
cable
attached
to
the
gammonings
of
the
bow
rose
obliquely
to
a
height
of
about
a
couple
of
yards
above
the
deck
and
passing
over
four
small
crutched
masts
was
made
fast
again
to
the
gammonings
of
the
stern
the
hull
measured
from
the
blade
of
the
to
the
some
twenty
to
five
and
twenty
yards
but
the
lowest
part
of
the
hold
did
not
exceed
five
feet
in
depth
there
was
no
cabin
and
the
ballast
arms
provisions
and
occupied
the
open
hold
to
get
a
clear
idea
of
the
details
of
this
structure
we
have
only
to
compare
the
appearance
of
ships
with
and
without
a
in
the
scenes
at
thebes
representing
the
celebration
of
a
festival
at
the
return
of
the
fleet
glaser
thinks
that
there
were
cabins
for
the
crew
under
the
deck
and
he
recognises
in
the
sixteen
oblong
marks
on
the
sides
of
the
vessels
at
deîr
so
many
as
there
could
not
have
been
space
for
so
many
cabins
i
had
concluded
that
these
were
ports
for
oars
to
be
used
in
time
of
battle
but
on
further
consideration
i
saw
that
they
represented
the
ends
of
the
beams
supporting
the
deck
the
bulwarks
were
raised
to
a
height
of
some
two
feet
and
the
thwarts
of
the
rowers
ran
up
to
them
on
both
the
port
and
starboard
sides
leaving
an
open
space
in
the
centre
for
the
bales
of
merchandise
soldiers
slaves
and
additional
passengers
a
double
set
of
and
a
single
mast
completed
the
equipment
the
latter
which
rose
to
a
height
of
some
feet
was
placed
amidships
and
was
held
in
an
upright
position
by
stays
the
masthead
was
surmounted
by
two
arrangements
which
answered
respectively
to
the
top
and
of
the
masts
of
a
galley
there
were
no
shrouds
on
each
side
from
the
masthead
to
the
rail
but
in
place
of
them
two
stays
ran
respectively
to
the
bow
and
stern
the
single
was
extended
between
two
yards
some
sixty
to
seventy
feet
long
and
each
made
of
two
pieces
spliced
together
at
the
centre
the
upper
yard
was
straight
while
the
lower
curved
upward
at
the
ends
the
yard
was
hoisted
and
lowered
by
two
halyards
which
were
made
fast
aft
at
the
feet
of
the
steersmen
the
yard
was
kept
in
its
place
by
two
lifts
which
came
down
from
the
masthead
and
were
attached
respectively
about
eight
feet
from
the
end
of
each
when
the
yard
was
hauled
up
it
was
further
supported
by
six
auxiliary
lifts
three
being
attached
to
each
the
lower
yard
made
fast
to
the
mast
by
a
knot
was
secured
by
sixteen
lifts
which
like
those
of
the
upper
yard
worked
through
the
one
of
the
exhibits

the
water

the
time
the
fleet
was
at
anchor
at
puanît
as
we
do
not
find
any
vessel
towing
one
after
her
we
naturally
conclude
that
the
boat
must
have
been
stowed
on
board

species
of

a
sailor
was
placed
on

properly
speaking
a
square
block
of
wood
containing
the
sheaves
on
which
the
halyards
travelled

apparatus
had
no
sheaves
and
answers
to
the

the
masts
of
a
galley
only
in
its
serving
the
same
purpose
the
crew
comprised
thirty
rowers
fifteen
on
each
side
four
two
steersmen
a
pilot
at
the
bow
who
signalled
to
the
men
at
the
helm
the
course
to
steer
a
captain
and
a
governor
of
the
slaves
who
formed
together
with
ten
soldiers
a
total
of
some
fifty
men
in
time
of
battle
as
the
rowers
would
be
exposed
to
the
missiles
of
the
enemy
the
bulwarks
were
further
heightened
by
a
mantlet
behind
which
the
oars
could
be
freely
moved
while
the
bodies
of
the
men
were
fully
protected
their
heads
alone
being
visible
above
it
the
soldiers
were
stationed
as
follows
two
of
them
took
their
places
on
the
forecastle
a
third
was
perched
on
the
masthead
in
a
sort
of
cage
improvised
on
the
bars
forming
the
top
while
the
remainder
were
posted
on
the
deck
and
poop
from
which
positions
and
while
waiting
for
the
order
to
board
they
could
pour
a
continuous
volley
of
arrows
on
the
archers
and
sailors
of
the
enemy
i
have
made
this
calculation
from
an
examination
of
the
scenes
in
which
ships
are
alternatively
represented
as
at
anchor
and
under
weigh
i
know
of
vessels
of
smaller
size
and
consequently
with
a
smaller
crew
but
i
know
of
none
larger
or
more
fully
manned
the
details
are
taken
from
the
only
representation
of
a
naval
battle
which
we
possess
up
to
this
moment
viz
that
of
which
i
shall
have
occasion
to
speak
further
on
in
connection
with
the
reign
of
ramses
iii
the
first
colony
of
which
the
phoenicians
made
themselves
masters
was
that
island
of
cyprus
whose
low
lurid
outline
they
could
see
on
fine
summer
evenings
in
the
glow
of
the
western
sky
some
hundred
and
ten
miles
in

and
in
breadth
it
is
driven
like
a

into
the
angle
which

makes
with
the

throws
out
to

narrow
strip
of

all
found
here
a
congenial
habitat
while
a
profusion
everywhere
of
flowers
which
saturated
the
air
with
their
penetrating
odours
spring
violets
anemones
the
lily
hyacinth
crocus
narcissus
and
wild
rose
led
the
greeks
to
bestow
upon
the
island
the
designation
of
balmy
mines
also
contributed
their
share
to
the
riches
of
which
the
island
could
boast
iron
in
small
quantities
alum
asbestos
agate
and
other
precious
stones
are
still
to
be
found
there
and
in
ancient
times
the
neighbourhood
of
tamassos
yielded
copper
in
such
quantities
that
the
romans
were
accustomed
to
designate
this
metal
by
the
name
and
the
word
passed
from
them
into
all
the
languages
of
europe
it
is
not
easy
to
determine
the
race
to
which
the
first
inhabitants
of
the
island
belonged
if
we
are
not
to
see
in
them
a
branch
of
the
kefâtiu
who
frequented
the
asiatic
shores
of
the
mediterranean
from
a
very
remote
period
in
the
time
of
egyptian
supremacy
they
called
their
country
asi
and
this
name
inclines
one
to
connect
the
people
with
the
ægeans
an
examination
of
the
objects
found
in
the
most
ancient
tombs
of
the
island
seems
to
confirm
this
opinion
these
consist
for
the
most
part
of
weapons
and
implements
of
stone
knives
hatchets
hammers
and
and
mingled
with
these
rude
objects
a
score
of
different
kinds
of
pottery
chiefly
and
of
coarse
design
pitchers
with
contorted
bowls
shallow
buckets
especially
of
the
variety
provided
with
spouts
and
with
pairs
of
rudimentary
handles
was
at
first
sought
for
on
the
asiatic
continent
at
is
on
the
euphrates
or
in
palestine
the
discovery
of
the
canopic
decree
allows
us
to
identify
it
with
cyprus
and
this
has
now
been
generally
done
the
reading
is
still
maintained
by
some
illustration
map
of
cyprus
the
pottery
is
red
or
black
in
colour
and
the
ornamentation
of
it
consists
of
incised
geometrical
designs
copper
and
bronze
where
we
find
examples
of
these
metals
do
not
appear
to
have
been
employed
in
the
manufacture
of
ornaments
or
but
usually
in
making
daggers
there
is
no
indication
anywhere
of
foreign
influence
and
yet
cyprus
had
already
at
this
time
entered
into
relations
with
the
civilized
nations
of
the
continent
according
to
chaldæan
tradition
it
was
conquered
about
the
year
by
sargon
of
agadê
without
insisting
upon
the
reality
of
this
conquest
which
in
any
case
must
have
been
ephemeral
in
its
nature
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
island
was
subjected
from
an
early
period
to
the
influence
of
the
various
peoples
which
lived
one
after
another
on
the
slopes
of
the
lebanon
popular
legend
attributes
to
king
kinyras
and
to
the
giblites
the
people
of
byblos
the
establishment
of
the
first
phoenician
colonies
in
the
southern
region
of
the
island
one
of
them
being
at
paphos
where
the
worship
of
adonis
and
astartê
continued
to
a
very
late
date
the
natives
preserved
their
own
language
and
customs
had
their
own
chiefs
and
maintained
their
national
independence
while
constrained
to
submit
at
the
same
time
to
the
presence
of
phoenician
colonists
or
merchants
on
the
coast
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
mines
in
the
mountains
the
trading
centres
of
these
settlers
kition
amathus
solius
golgos
and
tamassos
were
soon
however
converted
into
strongholds
which
ensured
to
phonicia
the
monopoly
of
the
immense
wealth
contained
in
the
island
an
examination
into
the
origin
of
the
cypriotes
formed
part
of
the
original
scheme
of
this
work
together
with
that
of
the
monuments
of
the
various
races
scattered
along
the
coast
of
asia
minor
and
the
islands
of
the
ægean
but
i
have
been
obliged
to
curtail
it
in
order
to
keep
within
the
limits
i
had
proscribed
for
myself
and
i
have
merely
epitomised
as
briefly
as
possible
the
results
of
the
researches
undertaken
in
those
regions
during
the
last
few
years
the
phoenician
origin
of
these
towns
is
proved
by
passages
from
classical
writers
the
date
of
the
colonisation
is
uncertain
but
with
the
knowledge
we
possess
of
the
efficient
vessels
belonging
to
the
various
phoenician
towns
it
would
seem
difficult
not
to
allow
that
the
coasts
at
least
of
cyprus
must
have
been
partially
occupied
at
the
time
of
the
egyptian
invasions
tyre
and
sidon
had
no
important
centres
of
industry
on
that
part
of
the
canaanite
coast
which
extended
to
the
south
of
carmel
and
egypt
even
in
the
time
of
the
shepherd
kings
would
not
have
tolerated
the
existence
on
her
territory
of
any
great
emporium
not
subject
to
the
immediate
supervision
of
her
official
agents
we
know
that
the
libyan
cliffs
long
presented
an
obstacle
to
inroads
into
egyptian
territory
and
baffled
any
attempts
to
land
to
the
westwards
of
the
delta
the
phoenicians
consequently
turned
with
all
the
greater
ardour
to
those
northern
regions
which
for
centuries
had
furnished
them
with
most
valuable
products
bronze
tin
amber
and
iron
both
native
and
wrought
a
little
to
the
north
of
the
orontes
where
the
syrian
border
is
crossed
and
asia
minor
begins
the
coast
turns
due
west
and
runs
in
that
direction
for
a
considerable
distance
the
phoenicians
were
accustomed
to
trade
along
this
region
and
we
may
attribute
perhaps
to
them
the
foundation
of
those
obscure
cities
kibyra
masura
euskopus
sylion
mygdalê
and
all
of
which
preserved
their
apparently
semitic
names
down
to
the
time
of
the
roman
epoch
the
whole
of
the
important
island
of
rhodes
fell
into
their
power
and
its
three
ports
ialysos
and
kamiros
afforded
them
a
base
of
operations
for
further
colonisation
on
leaving
rhodes
the
choice
of
two
routes
presented
itself
to
them
to
the
they
could
see
the
distant
outline
of
karpathos
and
on
the
far
horizon
behind
it
the
summits
of
the
cretan
chain
crete
itself
bars
on
the
south
the
entrance
to
the
ægean
and
is
almost
a
little
continent
and
no
direct
evidence
exists
to
lead
us
to
attribute
the
foundation
of
these
towns
to
the
phoenicians
but
the
semitic
origin
of
nearly
all
the
names
is
an
uncontested
fact
illustration
the
murex
trunculus
it
is
made
up
of
fertile
valleys
and
mountains
clothed
with
forests
and
its
inhabitants
could
employ
themselves
in
mines
and
fisheries
the
phoenicians
effected
a
settlement
on
the
coast
at
itanos
at
kairatos
and
at
arados
and
obtained
possession
of
the
peak
of
cythera
where
it
is
said
they
raised
a
sanctuary
to
astartê
if
on
leaving
rhodes
they
had
chosen
to
steer
due
north
they
would
soon
have
come
into
contact
with
numerous
rocky
islets
scattered
in
the
sea
between
the
continents
of
asia
and
europe
which
would
have
furnished
them
with
as
many
stations

easy
of
attack

more
readily
defended
than
posts
on
the
mainland
of
these
the
giblites
occupied

while
the
sidonians
chose
oliaros
and

we
find
traces
of
them
in
every
island
where
any
natural
product
such
as
metals
sulphur
alum
earth
emery
medicinal
plants
and
shells
for
producing
dyes
offered
an
attraction
the
purple
used
by
the
tyrians
for
dyeing
is
secreted
by
several
varieties
of
molluscs
common
in
the
eastern
mediterranean

most
esteemed
by
the
dyers
were
the

the
detritus

quantities
in

phoenician
towns
the

was
secreted
in
the
head
of
the
shellfish
to
obtain
it
the
shell
was
broken
by
a
blow
from
a
hammer
and
the
small
quantity
of
slightly
yellowish
liquid
which
issued
from
the
fracture
was
carefully
collected
and
stirred
about
in
salt
water
for
three
days

the

strained
through
a

to
free
it
from
the
particles
of
flesh
still
floating
in
it

the

no

by
the

the
fact

they
worked

obstacle

their
progress
in
another
narrow
channel

more
the
character

of
a
strait
it
was
with
difficulty
that
they
could
make
their
way
against
the
violence
of
its
current
which
either
tended
to
drive
their
vessels
on
shore
or
to
dash
them
against
the
reefs
which
hampered
the
navigation
of
the
channel
when
however
they
succeeded
in
making
the
passage
safely
they
found
themselves
upon

vast
and

to
designate

they
traded

the

if
inferior
to
the

possessed
an
independent
and
growing
civilization

which
are

would
have
satisfied
the
luxurious
princes
who
reigned
in
such
ancient
cities
as
troy
and

who
wanted
the
best
industrial
products
of

costly

rare
furniture
ornate
and
weapons
articles
of

curious

as
would
have
been
found
in
use
among
the
sovereigns
and
nobles
of
memphis

of
babylon
for
articles
to
offer
in
exchange
they
were
not

roughly
worked
products
of
their
own
country
their
craftsmen
though
less
successful
in
general
technique
than
their
oriental
contemporaries
exhibited
considerable
artistic
intelligence
and
an
extraordinary
manual
skill
accustomed
at
first
merely
to
copy
the
objects
sold
to
them
by
the
phoenicians
they
soon
developed
a
style
of
their
own
the
mycenaean
dagger
in
the
illustration
on

though
several
centuries
later
in
date
than
that
of
the
pharaoh
ahmosis
appears
to
be
traceable
to
this
ancient
source
of
inspiration
although
it
gives
evidence
of
new
elements
in
its
method
of
decoration
and
in
its
greater
freedom
of
treatment
the
inhabitants
of
the
valleys
of
the
nile
and
of
the
orontes
and
probably
also
those
of
the
euphrates
and
tigris
agreed
in
the
high
value
they
set
upon
these
artistic
objects
in
gold
silver
and
bronze
brought
to
them
from
the
further
shores
of
the
mediterranean
which
while
reproducing
their
own
designs
modified
them
to
a
certain
extent
for
just
as
we
now
imitate
types
of
ornamental
work
in
vogue
among
nations
less
civilized
than
ourselves
so
the
iegean
people
set
themselves
the
task
through
their
potters
and
engravers
of
reproducing
exotic
models
the
phoenician
traders
who
exported
to
greece
large
consignments
of
objects
made
under
various
influences
in
their
own
workshops
or
purchased
in
the
bazaars
of
the
ancient
world
brought
back
as
a
return
cargo
an
equivalent
number
of
works
of
art
bought
in
the
towns
of
the
west
which
eventually
found
their
way
into
the
various
markets
of
asia
and
africa
these
energetic
merchants
were
not
the
first
to
ply
this
profitable
trade
of
maritime
carriers
for
from
the
time
of
the
memphite
empire
the
products
of
northern
regions
had
found
their
way
through
the
intermediation
of
the
haûinibû
as
far
south
as
the
cities
of
the
delta
and
the
thebaid
but
this
commerce
could
not
be
said
to
be
either
regular
or
continuous
the
transmission
was
carried
on
from
one
neighbouring
tribe
to
another
and
the
syrian
sailors
were
merely
the
last
in
a
long
chain
of
intermediaries
a
tribal
war
a
migration
the
caprice
of
some
chief
being
sufficient
to
break
the
communication
and
even
cause
the
suspension
of
transit
for
a
considerable
period
the
phoenicians
desired
to
provide
against
such
risks
by
undertaking
themselves
to
fetch
the
objects
from
their
respective
sources
or
where
this
was
not
possible
from
the
ports
nearest
the
place
of
their
manufacture
reappearing
with
each
returning
year
in
the
localities
where
they
had
established
emporia
they
accustomed
the
natives
to
collect
against
their
arrival
such
products
as
they
could
profitably
use
in
bartering
with
one
or
other
of
their
many
customers
they
thus
established
on
a
fixed
line
of
route
a
kind
of
maritime
trading
service
which
placed
all
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
in
direct
communication
with
each
other
and
promoted
the
blending
of
the
youthful
west
with
the

we

that
he
came
into
contact
with
the
army
of

which
was
under
the
command
of
a
single
general
perhaps
the
king
of
mitanni
himself
or
one
of
the
lieutenants
of
the
king
of
who
had
collected
together
most
of
the
petty
princes
of
the
northern
country
to
resist
the
advance
of
the
intruder
the
contest
was
hotly
fought
out
on
both
sides

victory
at

remained
with
the
invaders
and
innumerable
prisoners
fell
into

the
conqueror
wished
to
be
recognised
henceforth
as
the
frontier
of
his
empire
he
thebes
with
immense
booty
by
which
gods
as
well
as
men
profited
for
he
consecrated
a
part
of
it
to
the
embellishment
of
the
temple
of
amon
and
the
sight
of
the
spoil
undoubtedly
removed
the
lingering
prejudices
which
the
people
had
cherished
against
expeditions
beyond
the
isthmus
thûtmosis
was
held
up
by
his
subjects
to
the
praise
of
posterity
as
having
come
into
actual
contact
with
that
country
and
its
people
which
had
hitherto
been
known
to
the
egyptians
merely
through
the
more
or
less
veracious
tales
of
exiles
and
travellers
the
aspect
of
the
great
river
of
the
naharaim
which
could
be
compared
with
the
nile
for
the
volume
of
its
waters
excited
their
admiration
they
were
however
puzzled
by
the
fact
that
it
flowed
from
north
to
south
and
even
were
accustomed
to
joke
at
the
necessity
of
reversing
the
terms
employed
in
egypt
to
express
going
up
or
down
the
river
this
first
syrian
campaign
became
the
model
for
most
of
those
subsequently
undertaken
by
the
pharaohs
it
took
the
form
of
a
bold
advance
of
troops
directed
from
zalû
towards
the
in
a
diagonal
line
through
the
country
who
routed
on
the
way
any
armies
which
might
be
opposed
to
them
carrying
by
assault
such
towns
as
were
easy
of
capture
while
passing
by
others
which
seemed
strongly
defended
pillaging
burning
and
slaying
on
every
side
there
was
no
suspension
of
hostilities
no
going
into
winter
quarters
but
a
triumphant
return
of
the
expedition
at
the
end
of
four
or
five
months
with
the
probability
of
having
to
begin
fresh
operations
in
the
following
year
should
the
vanquished
break
out
into
revolt
from
the
account
of
the
campaigns
of
amenôthes
i
thought
we
might
conclude
that
this
pharaoh
wintered
in
syria
at
least
once
but
the
text
does
not
admit
of
this
interpretation
and
we
must
therefore
for
the
present
give
up
the
idea
that
the
pharaohs
ever
spent
more
than
a
few
months
of
the
year
on
hostile
territory
the
troops
employed
in
these
campaigns
were
superior
to
any
others
hitherto
put
into
the
field
the
egyptian
army
inured
to
war
by
its
long
struggle
with
the
and
kept
in
training
since
the
reign
of
âhmosis
by
having
to
repulse
the
perpetual
incursions
of
the
ethiopian
or
libyan
barbarians
had
no
difficulty
in
overcoming
the
syrians
not
that
the
latter
were
wanting
in
courage
or
discipline
but
owing
to
their
limited
supply
of
recruits
and
the
political
disintegration
of
the
country
they
could
not
readily
place
under
arms
such
enormous
numbers
as
those
of
the
egyptians
egyptian
military
organisation
had
remained
practically
unchanged
since
early
times
the
army
had
always
consisted
firstly
of
the
militia
who
held
fiefs
and
were
under
the
obligation
of
personal
service
either
to
the
prince
of
the
nome
or
to
the
sovereign
secondly
of
a
permanent
force
which
was
divided
into
two
corps
distributed
respectively
between
the
and
the
delta
those
companies
which
were
quartered
on
the
frontier
or
about
the
king
either
at
thebes
or
at
one
of
the
royal
residences
were
bound
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
to
muster
for
a
campaign
at
any
given
moment
the
number
of
natives
liable
to
be
levied
when
occasion
required
by
or
as
we
should
say
by
classes
may
have
amounted
to
over
a
hundred
thousand
men
but
they
were
never
all
called
out
and
it
does
not
appear
that
the
army
on
active
service
ever
contained
more
than
thirty
thousand
men
at
a
time
and
probably
on
ordinary
occasions
not
much
more
than
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
the
only
numbers
which
we
know
are
those
given
by
herodotus
for
the
saïte
period
which
are
evidently
exaggerated
coming
down
to
modern
times
we
see
that
from
to
had
nearly
men
in
syria
egypt
and
the
sudan
and
in
at
the
time
when
the
treaties
imposed
upon
him
the
obligation
of
reducing
his
army
to
men
it
still
contained
we
shall
probably
not
be
far
wrong
in
estimating
the
total
force
which
the
pharaohs
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
lords
of
the
whole
valley
of
the
nile
and
of
part
of
asia
had
at
their
disposal

or
men

however
were
never
all
called
out
at
once
we
have
no
direct
information
respecting
the
armies
acting
in
syria

only
know
that
at
the

against
him
chariots

three

a

at
the

at
men
at
luxor
at
so
that
the
syrian
army
probably
contained
about
men
it
would
seem
that
the
egyptian
army
was
less
numerous
and
i
estimate
it
with
great
hesitation
at
about
or
men
it
was
considered
a
powerful
army

long
education
was
necessary
for
which
there
were
special
schools
of
instruction

those
who
were
destined
to
enter

were
sent
to
these
schools
when
little
more
than
children
to
each
man
as
soon
as
he
had
thoroughly
mastered
all
the
difficulties
of
the
profession
a
regulation
chariot
and
pair
of
horses
were
granted
for
which
he
was
responsible
to
the
pharaoh
or
to
his
generals

he
might
then
return
to
his
home

warrior
took
precedence
of

were

the

together
with

nobles

enlisted

egyptian
ever
willingly
trusted
himself
to
the
back
of

it
was
only
in
the
thick
of
a
battle
when
his
chariot
was
broken

seemed
no
other
way
of
escaping
from

mêlée

a
warrior
would
venture
to
mount

acted
as

used
neither
nor

were
provided
with
reins
with
which
to
guide
their

times
to

egyptian
civilization
had
already
penetrated
among
these
tribes
and
as
far
as
dress
and
demeanour
were
concerned
their
chiefs
differed
in
no
way
from
the
great
lords
who
formed

of

innate
taste
for

colours

betrayed

was
arranged
in
short
curls

to
have
frequently

her

appears
to
have
closely

stiffened

until
the
age

the
women
wrapped
themselves
in
a

garment

in
a

their

grass
on
the
back
supported
by
a
leather
band
which
passed
across
the
forehead
one
characteristic
of
all
these
tribes
was
their
love
of
singing
and
dancing
and
their
use
of
the
drum
and
cymbals
they
were
active
and
industrious
and
carefully
cultivated
the
rich
soil
of
the
plain

themselves
to
the
raising
of
cattle

of
oxen

horns
they
were

with

one

took
precedence
of
him

by

descent
she
had
a

us
that
she
was
wife
of
thûtmosis

mother
of
thûtmosis
ii
hâtshopsîtû
herself
was
not
however
of
purely
divine
descent
her
maternal
ancestor
sonisonbû
had
not
been
a
scion
of
the
royal
house
and
this
flaw
in
her
pedigree
threatened
to
mar
in
her
case
the
sanctity
of
the
solar
blood
according
to
egyptian
belief
this
defect
of
birth
could
only
be
remedied
by
a
miracle
and
the
ancestral
god
becoming
incarnate
in
the
earthly
father
at
the
moment
of
conception
had
to
condescend
to
infuse
fresh
virtue
into
his
race
in
this
manner
a
similar
instance
of
divine
substitution
is
known
to
us
in
the
case
of
two
other
sovereigns
viz
amenôthes
whose
father
titmosis
was
born
under
conditions
analogous
to
those
attending
the
birth
of
thûtmosis

we
know
how
greatly
puzzled
the
early
egyptologists
were
by
this
manner
of
depicting
the
queen
and
how
champollion
in
striving
to
explain
the
monuments
of
the
period
was
driven
to
suggest
the
existence
of
a
regent
amenenthes
the
male
counterpart
and
husband
of
hâtshopsîtû
whose
name
he
read
amense
this
hypothesis
adopted
by
rosellini
with
some
slight
modifications
was
rejected
by
birch
this
latter
writer
pointed
out
the
identity
of
the
two
personages
separated
by
champollion
and
proved
them
to
be
one
and
the
same
queen
the
amenses
of
manetho
he
called
her
hc
but
he
made
her
out
to
be
a
sister
of
amenôthes
associated
on
the
throne
with
her
brothers
thûtmosis
and
thûtmosis
il
and
regent
at
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
thûtmosis
iii
hineks
tried
to
show
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
thûtmosis
the
wife
of
thûtmosis
ii
and
the
sister
of
thûtmosis
iii
it
is
only
quite
recently
that
her
true
descent
and
place
in
the
family
tree
has
been
recognised
she
was
not
the
sister
but
the
aunt
of
thûtmosis
iii
the
queen
called
by
birch
the
latter
part
of
her
name
being
dropped
and
the
royal
prenomen
being
joined
to
her
own
name
was
subsequently
styled
or
hatasû
and
this
form
is
still
adopted
by
some
writers
the
true
reading
is
hâtshopsîtû
or
hâtshopsîtû
then
hâtshopsîû
or
hâtshepsîû
as
naville
has
pointed
out
her
father
united
her
while
still
young
to
her
brother
thûtmosis
who
appears
to
have
been
her
junior
and
this
fact
doubtless
explains
the
very
subordinate
part
which
he
plays
beside
the
queen
when
thûtmosis
died
egyptian
etiquette
demanded
that
a
man
should
be
at
the
head
of
affairs
and
this
youth
succeeded
his
father
in
office
but
hâtshopsîtû
while
relinquishing
the
semblance
of
power
and
the
externals
of
pomp
to
her
husband
kept
the
direction
of
the
state
entirely
in
her
own
hands
the
portraits
of
her
which
have
been
preserved
represent
her
as
having
refined
features
with
a
proud
and
energetic
expression
the
oval
of
the
face
is
elongated
the
cheeks
a
little
hollow
and
the
eyes
deep
set
under
the
arch
of
the
brow
while
the
lips
are
thin
and
tightly
closed
it
is
evident
from
the
expressions
employed
by
thûtmosis
in
associating
his
daughter
with
himself
on
the
throne
that
she
was
unmarried
at
the
time
and
naville
thinks
that
she
married
her
brother
thûtmosis
ii
after
the
death
of
her
father
it
appears
to
me
more
probable
that
thûtmosis
married
her
to
her
brother
after
she
had
been
raised
to
the
throne
with
a
view
to
avoiding
complications
which
might
have
arisen
in
the
royal
family
after
his
own
death
the
inscription
at
which
has
furnished
mariette
with
the
hypothesis
that
thûtmosis
and
thûtmosis
il
reigned
simultaneously
proves
that
the
person
mentioned
in
it
a
certain
penaîti
flourished
under
both
these
pharaohs
but
by
no
means
shows
that

architects
of

who
laid
there
the
foundations
of
a
building
which
was
destined
to
be
unique
in
the
world
its

consisted
of
an
avenue

running
between

it
reached

workmanship

the
finest
examples
of
this

thûtmosis
scarcely
did
more
than
lay
the
foundations
of
this
magnificent
building
but
his
mummy
was
buried
in
it
with
great
pomp
to
remain
there
until
a
period
of
disturbance
and
general
insecurity
obliged
those
in
charge
of
the
necropolis
to
remove
the
body
together
with
those
of

some
securer
the
king
was
already
advanced
in
age
at
the
time
of
his
death
being
over
fifty
years
old
to
judge
by
the
incisor
teeth
which
are
worn
and
corroded
by
the
impurities
of
which
the
egyptian
bread
was
full
both
de
rougé
and
mariette
were
opposed
to
the
view
that
the
temple
was
founded
by
thûtmosis
and
naville
agrees
with
them
judging
from
the
many
new
texts
discovered
by
naville
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
thûtmosis
began
the
structure
but
from
plans
it
would
appear
which
had
not
been
so
fully
developed
as
they
afterwards
became
prom
indications
to
be
found
here
and
there
in
the
inscriptions
of
the
ramesside
period
i
am
not
moreover
inclined
to
regard
deîr
as
the
funerary
chapel
of
tombs
which
were
situated
in
some
unknown
place
elsewhere
but
i
believe
that
it
included
the
of
thûtmosis
thûtmosis
queen
hâtshopsîtû
and
of
numerous
representatives
of
their
family
indeed
it
is
probable
that
thûtmosis
iii
and
his
children
found
here
also
their
last
illustration

of
the
mummy
of
thûtmosis
i
drawn
by
boudier
from
a

taken
by

the
body
though
small
and
emaciated
shows
evidence
of
unusual
muscular
strength
the
head
is
bald
the
features
are
refined
and
the
mouth
still
bears
an
expression
characteristic
of
shrewdness
and
cunning
the
coffin
of
thûtmosis
was
usurped
by
the
pinozmû
son
of
piônkhi
and
the
mummy
was
lost
i
fancy
i
have
discovered
it
in
mummy
no
of
which
the
head
presents
a
striking
resemblance
to
those
of
thûtmosis
ii
and
iii
thûtmosis
ii
carried
on
the
works
begun
by
his
father
but
did
not
long
survive
him
the
mask
on
his
coffin
represents
him
with
a
smiling
and
amiable
countenance
and
with
the
fine
pathetic
eyes
which
show
his
descent
from
the
pharaohs
of
the
xiith
dynasty
the

this

thinks
that
could
not
have
been
free
from
complicity
in
the
premature
death
of
thûtmosis
ii
but
i
am
inclined
to
believe
from
the
marks
of
disease
found
on
the
skin
of
his
mummy
that
the
queen
was
innocent
of
the
crime
here
ascribed
to

bey

bear
the
same
expression
which
indeed
is
that
of
the
mummy
itself
he
resembles
thûtmosis
but
his
features
are
not
so
marked
and
are
characterised
by
greater
gentleness
he
had
scarcely
reached
the
age
of
thirty
when
he
fell
a
victim
to
a
disease
of
which
the
process
of
embalming
could
not
remove
the
traces
the
skin
is
scabrous
in
patches
and
covered
with
scars
while
the
upper
part
of
the
skull
is
bald
the
body
is
thin
and
somewhat
shrunken
and
appears
to
have
lacked
vigour
and
muscular
power
by
his
marriage
with
his
sister
thûtmosis
left
daughters
only
but
he
had
one
son
also
a
thûtmosis
by
a
woman
of
low
birth
perhaps
merely

this
child
her
successor

his
youth
and
humble
parentage
could
not
excite
her
jealousy
she
betrothed
him
to
her
one
surviving
daughter
hâtshopsîtû
and
having
thus
settled
the
succession
in
the
male
line
she
continued
to
rule
alone
in
the
name
of
her
nephew
who
was
still
a
minor
as
she
had
done
formerly

king
in

the
absence
of
princely
titles
while
it
shows
the
humble
extraction
of
the
lady
isis
explains
at
the
same
time
the
somewhat
obscure
relations
between
hâtshopsîtû
and
her
nephew
her
reign
was
a
prosperous
one
but
whether
the
flourishing
condition
of
things
was
owing
to
the
ability
of
her
political
administration
or
to
her
fortunate
choice
of
ministers
we
are
unable
to
tell
she
pressed
forward
the
work
of
building
with
great
activity
under
the
direction
of
her
architect
sanmût
not
only
at
deîr
but
at
karnak
and
indeed
everywhere
in
thebes
the
plans
of
the
building
had
been
arranged
under
thûtmosis
and
their
execution
had
been
carried
out
so
quickly
that
in
many
cases
the
queen
had
merely
to
see
to
the
sculptural
ornamentation
on
the
all
but
completed
walls
this
work
however
afforded
her
sufficient
excuse
according
to
egyptian
custom
to

by

believed
that
its

were
the

was
indeed
the
part

i
hold
with

have

afford
anchorage
to
several
vessels

permit

their
performing

only

at

shown
from

reliefs
that
the
egyptians
must
have
landed
not
on

was
at

in
the
estuary
of

of

as
we
may
infer
those
of
other
oriental
nations
generally
for
we
may
be
tolerably
sure
that
when
the
phoenicians
ventured
into
the
distant
parts
of
the
mediterranean
it
was
after
a
similar
fashion
that
they
managed
and
armed
their

the
natural

of
the
asiatic

greek
coast
on
which

effected
a

differed
widely
from
those
of

the
phoenician
navigators
were
themselves
provided
with
similar
objects
of
exchange
and
in
their
commercial
dealings
with
the

the
methods
of
procedure
of
the
european
traders
were
doubtless
similar
to
those
of
the
egyptians

the
barbarians

sea
hâtshopsîtû
reigned
for
at
least
eight
years
after
this
memorable
expedition
and
traces
of
her
further
activity
are
to
be
observed
in
every
part
of
the
nile
valley
she
even
turned
her
attention
to
the
delta
and
began
the
task
of
reorganising
this
part
of
her
kingdom
which
had
been
much
neglected
by
her
predecessors
the
wars
between
the
theban
princes
and
the
lords
of
avaris
had
lasted
over
a
century
and
during
that
time
no
one
had
had
either
sufficient
initiative
or
leisure
to
superintend
the
public
works
which
were
more
needed
here
than
in
any
other
part
of
egypt
the
canals
were
silted
up
with
mud
the
marshes
and
the
desert
had
encroached
on
the
cultivated
lands
the
towns
had
become
impoverished
and
there
were
some
provinces
whose
population
consisted
solely
of
shepherds
and
bandits
hâtshopsîtû
desired
to
remedy
these
evils
if
only
for
the
purpose
of
providing
a
practicable
road
for
her
armies
marching
to
zalû
for
syria
this
follows
from
the
great
inscription
at
which
is
commonly
interpreted
as
proving
that
the
kings
still
held
sway
in
egypt
in
the
reign
of
thûtmosis
and
that
they
were
driven
out
by
him
and
his
aunt
it
seems
to
me
that
the
queen
is
simply
boasting
that
she
had
repaired
the
monuments
which
had
been
injured
by
the
shepherds
during
the
time
they
sojourned
in
egypt
in
the
land
of
avaris
up
to
the
present
time
no
trace
of
these
restorations
has
been
found
on
the
sites
the
expedition
to
pûanît
being
mentioned
in
lines
they
must
be
of
later
date
than
the
year
ix
of
hâtshopsîtû
and
thûtmosis
iii
she
also
turned
her
attention
to
the
mines
of
sinai
which
had
not
been
worked
by
the
egyptian
kings
since
the
end
of
the
xiith
dynasty
in
the
year
xvi
an
officer
of
the
household
was
despatched
to
the
wady
magharah
the
site
of
the
ancient
works
with
orders
to
inspect
the
valleys
examine
the
veins
and
restore
there
the
temple
of
the
goddess
hâthor
having
accomplished
his
mission
he
returned
bringing
with
him
a
consignment
of
those
blue
and
green
stones
which
were
so
highly
esteemed
by
the
egyptians
meanwhile
thûtmosis
iii
was
approaching
manhood
and
his
aunt
the
queen
instead
of
abdicating
in
his
favour
associated
him
with
herself
more
frequently
in
the
external
acts
of
government
the
account
of
the
youth
of
thûtmosis

as

it
out
to
be
from
an
inscription
of
this
king
the
exile
of
the
royal
child
at
bûto
his
long
sojourn
in
the
marshes
his
triumphal
return
must
all
be
rejected
brugsch
accepted
as
actual
history
a
poetical
passage
where
the
king
identifies
himself
with
horus
son
of
isis
and
goes
so
far
as
to
attribute
to
himself
the
adventures
of
the
god
she
was
forced
to
yield
him
precedence
in
those
religious
ceremonies
which
could
be
performed
by
a
man
only
such
as
the
dedication
of
one
of
the
city

of
ombos
and
the
foundation
and
marking
out
of
a
temple

but
for
the
most
part
she
obliged
him
to
remain
in
the
background
and
take
a
secondary
place
beside
her
we
are
unable
to
determine
the
precise
moment
when
this
dual
sovereignty
came
to
an
end
it
was
still
existent
in
the
xvith
year
of
the
reign
but
it
had
ceased
before
the
xxiind
year
death
alone
could
take
the
sceptre
from
the
hands
that
held
it
and
thûtmosis
had
to
curb
his
impatience
for
many
a
long
day
before
becoming
the
real
master
of
egypt
he
was
about
years
of
age
when
this
event
took
place
and
he
immediately
revenged
himself
for
the
long
repression
he
had
undergone
by
endeavouring
to
destroy
the
very
remembrance
of
her
whom
he
regarded
as
a
usurper
every
portrait
of
her
that
he
could
deface
without
exposing
himself
to
being
accused
of
sacrilege
was
cut
away
and
he
substituted
for
her
name
either
that
of
thûtmosis
or
of
thûtmosis
ii

a
complete
political
change
was
effected
both
at
home
and
abroad
from
the
first
day
of
his
accession
to
power
hâtshopsîtû
had
been
averse
to
war
during
the
whole
of
her
reign
there
had
not
been
a
single
campaign
undertaken
beyond
the
isthmus
of
suez
and
by
the
end
of
her
life
she
had
lost
nearly
all
that
her
father
had
gained
in
syria
the
people
of
kharu
had
shaken
off
the
yoke
probably
at
the
instigation
of
the
king
of
the
amorites
and
nothing
remained
to
egypt
of
the
asiatic
province
but
gaza
sharûhana
and
the
neighbouring
villages
the
young
king
set
out
with
his
army
in
the
latter
days
of
the
year
xxii
he
reached
gaza
on
the
of
the
month
of
pakhons
in
time
to
keep
the
anniversary
of
his
coronation
in
that
town
and
to
inaugurate
the
year
of
his
reign
by
festivals
in
honour
of
his
father
amon
they
lasted
the
usual
length
of
time
and
all
the
departments
of
state
took
part
in
them
but
it
was
not
a
propitious
moment
for
lengthy
ceremonies
de
rougé
thought
that
he
had
discovered
in
a
slightly
damaged
inscription
bearing
upon
the
pûanît
expedition
the
mention
of
a
tribute
paid
by
the
lotanû
there
is
nothing
in
the
passage
cited
but
the
mention
of
the
usual
annual
dues
paid
by
the
chiefs
of
pûanît
and
of
the
ilîm
this
is
at
least
what
may
be
inferred
from
the
account
of
the
campaign
where
the
prince
of
qodshû
a
town
of
the
amaûru
amorites
figures
at
the
head
of
the
coalition
formed
against
thûtmosis
iii
this
is
the
conclusion
to
be
adopted
from
the
beginning
of
the
inscription
of
thûtmosis
iii
during
the
duration
of
these
same
years
the
country
of
the
lotanû
was
in
discord
until
other
times
succeeded
them
when
the
people
who
were
in
the
town
of
sharûhana
from
the
town
of
yûrza
to
the
most
distant
regions
of
the
earth
succeeded
in
making
a
revolt
against
his
the
account
of
this
campaign
has
been
preserved
to
us
on
a
wall
adjoining
the
granite
sanctuary
at
karnak
the
king
left
gaza
the
following
day
the
of
pakhons
he
marched
but
slowly
at
first
following
the
usual
caravan
route
and
despatching
troops

levy
contributions
on
the

as

and
harîlu
on
the
day
he
had
not
proceeded
further
than
yahmu
where
he
received
information
which
caused
him
to
push
quickly
forward
the
lord
of
qodshû
had
formed
an
alliance
with
the
syrian
princes
on
the
borders
of
naharaim
and
had
extorted
from
them
promises
of
help
he
had
already
gone
so
far
as
to
summon
contingents
from
the
upper
orontes
the
litany
and
the
upper
jordan
and
was
concentrating
them
at
megiddo
where
he
proposed
to
stop
the
way
of
the
invading
army
thûtmosis
called
together
his
principal
officers
and
having
imparted
the
news
to
them
took
counsel
with
them
as
to
a
plan
of
attack
three
alternative
routes
were
open
to
him
the
most
direct
approached
the
position
on
the
front
crossing
mount
carmel
by
the
saddle
now
known
as
the
umm
but
the
great
drawback
attached
to
this
route
was
its
being
so
restricted
that
the
troops
would
be
forced
to
advance
in
too
thin
a
file
and
the
head
of
the
column
would
reach
the
plain
and
come
into
actual
conflict
with
the
enemy
while
the
would
only
be
entering
the
defiles
in
the
neighbourhood
of
aluna
the
second
route
bore
a
little
to
the
east
crossing
the
mountains
beyond
dutîna
and
reaching
the
plain
near
taânach
but
it
offered
the
same
disadvantages
as
the
other
the
third
road
ran
north
of
to
meet
the
great
highway
which
cuts
the
of
nablûs
skirting
the
foot
of
tabor
near
jenîn
a
little
to
the
north
of
megiddo
it
was
not
so
direct
as
the
other
two
but
it
was
easier
for
troops
and
the
generals
advised
that
it
should
be
followed
the
king
was
so
incensed
that
he
was
tempted
to
attribute
their
prudence
to
cowardice
my
life
by
the
love
that
râ
hath
for
me
by
the
favour
that
i
enjoy
from
my
master

by
the
perpetual
youth
of
my

ye
have
spoken

that
will
follow
my

will
be
said
among
the
vile
enemies
detested

not
his

we

whithersoever
thou
goest
as
it
befitteth
a
servant
to
follow
his
the
word
of
command
was
given
to
the
men
thûtmosis
himself
led
the
vanguard
and
the
whole
army
horsemen
and
followed
in
single
file
wending
their
way
through
the
thickets
which
covered
the
southern
slopes
of
mount
carmel
the
position
of
the
towns
mentioned
and
of
the
three
roads
has
been
discussed
by
de
rougé
also
by
de
saulcy
who
fixed
the
position
of
yahmu
at
and
showed
that
the
egyptian
army
must
have
passed
through
the
defiles
of
umm

disagreed
with
this
opinion
in
certain
respects
and
identified
aluna
aruna
at
first
with
arrabeh
and
afterwards
with
arraneh
he
thought
that
thûtmosis
came
out
upon

placed

entered
the
wild
defiles
through
which
it
was
necessary
to
pass
in
order
to
reach
the
enemy
the
king
had
taken
precautionary
measures
against
any
possible
attempt
of
the
natives
to
cut
the
main
column
during
this
crossing
of
the
mountains
his
position
might
at
any
moment
have
become
a
critical
one
had
the
allies
taken
advantage
of
it
and
attacked
each
battalion
as
it
issued
on
to
the
plain
before
it

but
the
prince
of
qodshû
either
from
ignorance
of
his
movements
or
confident
of
victory
in
the
open
declined
to
take
the
initiative
towards
one

the
afternoon

egyptians
found
themselves

side
of

close
to

thûtmosis
announced
his

enemy
on

morrow
a
council
of

was
held
to
decide
on
the
position

on

the
citizens
fearing

closed

of

naturally
shrink

this
return
to
an
aggressive
policy
on
the
part
of
the
egyptians
after
the
weakness
they
had
exhibited
during
the
later
period
of
regency
seriously
disconcerted
the
asiatic
sovereigns
they
had
vainly
flattered
themselves
that
the
invasion
of
thûtmosis
was
merely
the
caprice
of
an
adventurous
prince
and
they
hoped
that
when
his
love
of
enterprise
had
expended
itself
egypt
would
permanently
withdraw
within
her
traditional
boundaries
and
that
the
relations
of
elam
with
babylon
carchemish
with
qodshû
and
the
barbarians
of
the
persian
gulf
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
iranian
would
resume
their
former
course
this
vain
delusion
was
dispelled
by
the
advent
of
a
new
thûtmosis
who
showed
clearly
by
his
actions
that
he
intended
to
establish
and
maintain
the
sovereignty
of
egypt
over
the
western
dependencies
at
least
of
the
ancient
chaldæan
empire
that
is
to
say
over
the
countries
which
bordered
the
middle
course
of
the
euphrates
and
the
coasts
of
the
mediterranean
the
audacity
of
his
marches
the
valour
of
his
men
the
facility
with
which
in
a
few
hours
he
had
crushed
the
assembled
forces
of
half
syria
left
no
room
to
doubt
that
he
was
possessed
of
personal
qualities
and
material
resources
sufficient
to
carry
out
projects
of
the
most
ambitious
character
babylon
enfeebled
by
the
perpetual
dissensions
of
its
cossæan
princes
was
no
longer
in
a
position
to
contest
with
him

little
authority
she
still
retained
over
the
peoples
of
naharaim
or
of
protected
by
the
distance
which
separated
her
from
the
nile
valley
she
preserved
a
sullen
neutrality
while
assyria
hastened
to
form
a
peaceful
alliance
with
the
invading
power
again
and
again
its
kings
sent
to
thûtmosis
presents
in
proportion
to
their
resources
and
the
pharaoh
naturally
treated
their
advances
as
undeniable
proofs
of
their
voluntary
vassalage
each
time
that
he
received
from
them
a
gift
of
metal
or
he
proudly
recorded
their
tribute
in
the
annals
of
his
reign
and
if
in
exchange
he
sent
them
some
egyptian
product
it
was
in
smaller
quantities
as
might
be
expected
from
a
lord
to
his
vassal

may
be
mentioned
here
that

not
occur

only
that

princess

the
king
would
place
in
his
harem

graciously
pass
on
to
one
of
his
children

when
on
the
other
hand
an
even
distant
relative
of
the
pharaoh
was
asked
in
marriage
for
some
king
on
the
banks
of
the
tigris
or
euphrates
the
request
was
met
with
a
disdainful
negative
the
daughters
of
the
sun
were
of
too
noble
a
race
to
stoop
to
such
alliances
and
they
would
count
it
a
humiliation
to
be
sent
in

to
a
foreign
court
