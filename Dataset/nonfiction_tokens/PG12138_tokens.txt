colonial
attempts
to
found
a
college
the
state
of
maryland
has
been
almost
extravagantly
liberal
in
bestowing
charters
on
colleges
and
professional
schools
over
forty
such
charters
have
been
given
by
the
legislature
and
in
many
cases
the
result
has
proved
that
the
gift
of
a
charter
was
not
warranted
by
the
stability
of
the
institution
to
which
was
thus
granted
the
power
of
conferring
degrees
in
many
other
cases
however
the
institutions
have
grown
and
flourished
and
have
had
an
honorable
history
collegiate
education
in
maryland
did
not
begin
until
after
the
revolution
in
the
colonial
period
there
was
no
demand
for
it
sufficient
to
warrant
the
establishment
of
a
seat
of
higher
learning
for
this
state
of
things
there
were
several
causes
the
majority
of
the
early
settlers
were
planters
and
frontiersmen
having
little
need
for
an
extended
education
and
desiring
it
still
less
of
the
wealthier
classes
some
were
like
the
english
gentry
caring
for
little
else
than
sport
and
others
who
did
desire
the
advantages
of
a
culture
higher
than
that
obtainable
from
a
village
schoolmaster
or
a
private
tutor
found
it
elsewhere
they
went
over
to
william
and
mary
college
in
virginia
across
the
ocean
to
england
or
in
case
of
some
catholics
like
charles
carroll
to
the
institutions
on
the
continent
of
europe
but
though
no
college
was
established
in
colonial
times
there
was
no
lack
of
plans
and
attempts
for
one
in
while
as
yet
harvard
was
the
only
american
college
there
was
read
and
passed
in
the
upper
house
of
the
assembly
an
act
for
the
founding
and
erecting
of
a
school
or
college
within
this
province
for
the
education
of
youth
in
learning
and
virtue
the
lower
house
amended
and
passed
the
bill
but
the
plan
seems
never
to
have
progressed
further
according
to
the
bill
the
lord
proprietor
was
to
set
out
his
declaration
of
what
privileges
and
immunities
shall
be
enjoyed
by
the
schollars
and
the
tutors
or
school
masters
were
to
be
of
the
reformed
church
of
england
or
if
two
in
number
to
be
the
one
for
the
catholick
and
other
for
the
children
a
second
collegiate
plan
was
brought
before
the
legislature
in
but
having
passed
the
upper
house
was
seemingly
not
acted
on
by
the
lower
this
proposed
college
was
intended
to
be
placed
at
annapolis
and
was
to
offer
instruction
in
theology
law
medicine
and
the
higher
branches
of
a
collegiate
education
the
governor
of
the
colony
was
to
be
its
chancellor
and
provision
was
made
for
a
faculty
of
five
under
whom
students
were
to
be
instructed
in
everything
from
their
alphabet
upwards
a
third
unsuccessful
attempt
to
secure
the
founding
of
a
college
was
made
in
and
a
fourth
in
when
contrary
to
the
earlier
course
of
events
the
rock
on
which
the
project
was
shipwrecked
was
found
in
the
upper
house
the
college
was
to
be
placed
at
annapolis
to
occupy
governor
bladen
mansion
and
to
have
a
faculty
of
seven
masters
who
were
to
be
provided
with
five
servants
the
expense
was
to
be
defrayed
from
the
colonial
treasury
in
case
a
tax
to
be
levied
on
bachelors
should
prove
insufficient
for
the
purpose
the
failure
of
these
projects
did
not
dampen
the
zeal
of
the
advocates
of
higher
education
in
we
find
william
eddis
surveyor
of
customs
at
annapolis
writing
that
the
legislature
of
the
province
had
determined
to
fit
up
governor
bladen
mansion
and
to
endow
and
form
a
college
for
the
education
of
youth
in
every
liberal
and
useful
branch
of
science
which
college
conducted
under
excellent
regulations
will
shortly
preclude
the
necessity
of
crossing
the
atlantic
for
the
completion
of
a
classical
and
polite
education
the
gathering
storm
of
war
however
drew
men
attention
away
from
this
project
the
first
university
of
maryland
the
rev
william
smith
head
of
what
is
now
the
university
of
pennsylvania
being
out
of
employment
on
account
of
the
revocation
of
that
college
charter
was
called
as
pastor
in
chestertown
on
the
eastern
shore
in
to
add
to
his
income
he
conceived
the
idea
of
opening
a
school
for
instruction
in
higher
branches
of
education
as
a
nucleus
for
his
school
he
took
an
old
academy
the
kent
county
school
and
beginning
the
work
of
teaching
was
so
successful
that
in
the
legislature
on
his
application
granted
the
school
a
charter
as
maryland
first
college
to
it
the
name
of
was
given
in
honorable
and
perpetual
memory
of
his
excellency
general
george
washington
smith
was
so
earnest
and
zealous
in
the
presentation
of
the
claims
of
the
college
that
in
five
years
he
had
raised
from
the
people
of
the
eastern
shore
all
seemed
propitious
for
the
college
in
the
first
class
graduated
and
the
first
degrees
ever
granted
in
maryland
were
conferred
at
the
same
time
the
of
the
college
building
was
laid
and
in
general
washington
himself
visited
the
college
smith
prepared
a
three
years
curriculum
for
the
institution
equal
to
that
of
any
college
of
the
day
and
similar
to
the
one
used
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania
but
the
western
shore
could
not
endure
that
the
educational
success
of
its
rival
section
of
the
state
should
so
far
outstrip
its
own
in
the
early
days
of
the
state
the
sections
were
nearly
equal
in
importance
and
the
prevailing
dualism
of
the
political
system
invaded
the
field
of
education
in
two
years
after
the
founding
of
washington
college
was
chartered
it
was
to
be
placed
at
annapolis
and
in
it
was
merged
the
old
county
academy
king
william
school
founded
some
eighty
years
before
by
the
same
act
the
two
colleges
were
united
in
the
of
this
university
was
modeled
on
the
english
type
the
governor
was
to
be
its
chancellor
and
the
governing
body
was
to
be
the
convocation
of
the
university
of
maryland
the
convocation
was
to
be
composed
of
seven
members
of
the
board
of
visitors
and
governors
and
two
of
the
faculty
of
each
college
it
was
to
establish
ordinances
for
the
government
of
the
colleges
to
cause
a
uniformity
in
the
manners
and
literature
to
receive
appeals
from
the
students
and
to
confer
the
higher
degrees
and
honors
of
the
university
its
meetings
were
to
be
annual
and
to
be
held
alternately
at
each
college
on
its
commencement
day
the
provisions
of
the
act
were
never
carried
out
two
fruitless
attempts
were
made
to
hold
sessions
of
convocation
in
and
and
then
nothing
was
even
attempted
so
thoroughly
was
the
project
forgotten
that
the
legislature
of
in
withdrawing
the
state
appropriations
from
the
two
colleges
did
not
even
mention
the
university
and
in
though
the
old
charter
had
never
been
repealed
there
was
no
hesitation
in
bestowing
the
name
of
university
of
maryland
on
a
second
institution
the
two
colleges
which
constituted
this
first
university
are
still
existing
and
doing
good
work
the
elder
washington
college
lost
smith
in
by
his
return
to
philadelphia
and
to
his
old
position
there
he
was
succeeded
by
rev
colin
ferguson
a
native
of
kent
county
and
educated
at
edinburgh
university
under
him
the
college
continued
to
flourish
until
the
withdrawal
of
the
state
appropriation
in
the
constitutionality
of
this
withdrawal
is
questionable
as
the
original
grant
was
to
be
paid
annually
forever
but
the
state
refused
to
permit
itself
to
be
sued
by
the
college
and
some
years
later
on
increasing
its
appropriation
to
the
college
the
legislature
required
a
release
of
all
claims
on
the
state
under
the
original
act
by
the
act
of
the
activity
of
the
college
was
paralyzed
and
its
usefulness
much
impaired
it
had
not
yet
become
strong
enough
to
stand
alone
and
when
the
helping
hand
of
the
state
was
taken
away
it
was
almost
obliged
to
close
its
doors
to
students
since
that
time
the
state
has
renewed
its
grants
to
the
college
and
has
greatly
aided
it
in
performing
its
functions
but
from
the
disastrous
effects
of
the
act
of
the
institution
has
never
fully
recovered
indeed
from
to
nothing
but
a
grammar
school
seems
to
have
been
maintained
in
the
college
building
in
the
latter
year
however
the
college
was
since
the
legislature
had
granted
it
a
lottery
of
a
year
later
rev
francis
waters
became
principal
and
under
his
able
leadership
the
college
bid
fair
to
regain
its
old
position
but
in
a
second
great
misfortune
overtook
it
on
january
the
college
building
was
discovered
to
be
on
fire
and
in
spite
of
the
most
zealous
efforts
was
entirely
consumed
after
this
misfortune
the
college
proper
seems
to
have
been
suspended
a
second
time
and
only
a
grammar
school
maintained
with
one
instructor
the
classes
were
conducted
in
a
building
intended
originally
for
a
rectory
until
that
was
destroyed
by
fire
in
when
the
school
was
again
moved
richard
ringgold
the
principal
of
the
school
from
to
seems
to
have
been
a
man
of
ability
and
under
him
the
number
of
students
so
much
increased
that
in
it
was
resolved
to
rebuild
the
college
on
the
old
site
and
to
revive
the
college
course
as
a
result
the
present
main
building
was
erected
the
laid
with
imposing
ceremonies
on
may
and
the
college
was
reopened
in
its
own
edifice
on
january
in
a
class
of
four
was
graduated
and
in
two
additional
buildings
were
erected
one
for
the
principal
residence
and
the
other
for
dormitories
and
recitation
rooms
the
college
continued
prosperous
during
the
second
administration
of
rev
dr
waters
from
to
but
in
the
presidency
of
his
successor
rev
andrew
sutton
came
the
civil
war
depriving
the
college
of
its
southern
constituency
and
distracting
men
minds
from
learning
after
the
rebellion
an
unfortunate
selection
of
teachers
and
laxness
of
discipline
caused
the
college
to
lose
still
more
ground
and
wm
rivers
principal
from
to
had
much
to
do
to
build
it
up
again
he
was
a
faithful
and
diligent
teacher
and
under
him
the
moral
tone
of
the
college
was
improved
and
the
course
of
instruction
enlarged
the
present
head
reid
is
still
further
advancing
the
cause
of
the
institution
and
a
new
career
of
prosperity
seems
opening
before
maryland
oldest
college
and
the
only
one
on
the
eastern
shore
of
the
chesapeake
bay
john
college
like
its
sister
institution
founded
on
a
basis
started
out
under
even
fairer
auspices
it
was
granted
by
the
state
governor
bladen
mansion
and
four
acres
of
land
surrounding
it
was
made
heir
to
the
funds
of
king
school
and
secured
from
private
beneficence
in
the
first
two
years
of
its
history
the
bladen
mansion
now
known
as
mcdowell
hall
was
repaired
and
enlarged
and
on
august
bishop
carroll
was
elected
president
of
the
board
of
visitors
and
governors
and
john
mcdowell
accepted
the
professorship
of
mathematics
after
unsuccessful
attempts
to
obtain
a
principal
from
england
mcdowell
was
chosen
to
that
position
in
the
following
year
and
continued
in
office
until
the
state
withdrew
its
aid
to
the
college
in
he
was
a
man
of
great
learning
and
was
very
successful
at
john
and
later
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania
as
provost
under
him
john
flourished
greatly
and
many
men
of
a
national
reputation
were
enrolled
among
its
students
from
the
time
the
first
class
graduated
in
the
same
disaster
fell
on
john
as
on
washington
college
the
legislature
withdrew
the
annual
grant
given
by
the
state
the
same
doubt
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
withdrawal
existed
here
and
the
state
confirmed
its
position
in
the
same
way
by
increasing
its
appropriation
in
on
condition
of
the
college
accepting
it
in
full
satisfaction
of
all
claims
against
the
state
under
the
original
charter
of
late
years
maryland
has
been
quite
generous
to
john
but
it
has
never
quite
recovered
the
station
and
prestige
it
lost
by
the
taking
away
of
the
state
grant
in
in
the
first
despair
over
the
act
of
the
legislature
the
visitors
and
governors
voted
to
discontinue
the
college
but
their
courage
soon
returned
and
the
rev
bethel
judd
elected
principal
in
was
able
to
graduate
a
class
in
after
his
withdrawal
in
matters
were
in
a
disturbed
state
for
some
years
and
no
classes
were
graduated
until
when
rev
henry
davis
the
father
of
maryland
famous
orator
henry
winter
davis
was
principal
after
that
year
there
were
no
graduates
until
when
rev
william
rafferty
was
head
of
the
college
the
struggle
for
existence
was
a
hard
one
and
the
wonder
is
that
the
college
succeeded
as
well
as
it
did
with
however
began
a
third
and
more
successful
period
in
the
history
of
john
in
that
year
the
rev
hector
humphreys
then
only
years
of
age
was
chosen
president
he
was
a
native
of
connecticut
and
a
graduate
of
yale
college
in
and
was
called
to
john
from
the
professorship
of
ancient
languages
at
washington
trinity
college
in
his
native
state
the
effect
of
his
energy
and
devotion
was
soon
recognized
and
largely
through
his
efforts
was
passed
the
compromise
of
the
curriculum
was
enlarged
the
instruction
made
more
thorough
and
classes
were
yearly
graduated
with
but
six
exceptions
until
his
death
in
his
energy
was
very
great
his
learning
wide
and
accurate
in
after
travelling
about
the
state
in
the
interests
of
the
college
he
succeeded
in
raising
about
which
were
used
in
the
erection
of
a
second
building
for
the
college
which
most
appropriately
has
since
been
called
by
his
name
during
his
administration
the
professors
houses
were
also
built
as
was
pinkney
hall
a
third
building
for
the
use
of
the
college
humphreys
also
secured
cabinets
and
philosophical
apparatus
for
the
college
and
gave
instruction
in
political
economy
latin
and
greek
chemistry
geology
natural
philosophy
astronomy
composition
elocution
evidences
of
christianity
moral
and
intellectual
philosophy
rhetoric
and
logic
verily
an
encyclopaedic
man
of
vast
industry
only
four
years
after
humphreys
death
the
war
of
the
rebellion
broke
out
and
john
unlike
the
temple
of
janus
closed
its
doors
at
the
rumors
of
war
the
buildings
were
used
as
an
hospital
and
not
until
was
the
college
again
reopened
with
the
educator
henry
barnard
at
its
head
in
less
than
a
year
he
resigned
to
become
the
first
united
states
commissioner
of
education
and
neither
he
nor
his
successor
james

was

until
was
able
to
graduate
a
class
since
the
beginning
of
the

james
garnett
ll
the
succession
of
classes
has
been
unbroken
and
the
college
has
steadily
advanced
in
reputation
and
usefulness
garnett
made
the
english
department
especially
excellent
and
after
ten
years
faithful
service
resigned

the

his
successor
made
a
departure
from
the

resigned

the
four

administration

has
been
a
most
successful
one
and
john

and
reputation
the
second
university
of
maryland
most
universities
have
developed
from
a
college
the
university
of
maryland
differs
from
them
for
it
originated
in
a
medical
school
in
john
davidge
of
baltimore
began
a
private
class
in
medicine
and
was
so
successful
in
it
that
in
he
associated
with
himself
drs
james
cocke
and
john
shaw
and
these
three
obtained
from
the
legislature
a
charter
for
the
school
under
the
name
of
the
college
of
medicine
of
maryland
there
was
made
a
close
connection
between
the
college
of
medicine
and
the
state
medical
and
chirurgical
faculty
and
its
board
of
medical
examiners
were
made
members
of
the
board
of
trustees
of
the
college
the
legislature
also
granted
the
college
a
lottery
of
lectures
which
had
been
carried
on
at
the
professors
houses
were
begun
in
at
a
building
on
the
corner
of
fayette
chatham
street
and
mcclellan
alley
and
the
first
class
consisting
of
five
received
its
degrees
in
as
the
school
grew
and
nourished
the
ideas
of
its
founders
become
more
extensive
and
in
a
long
act
was
passed
authorizing
the
college
for
the
promotion
of
medical
knowledge
to
constitute
appoint
and
annex
to
itself
the
other
three
colleges
or
faculties
viz
the
faculty
of
divinity
the
faculty
of
law
and
the
faculty
of
the
arts
and
sciences
and
that
the
four
faculties
or
colleges
thus
united
shall
be
and
they
are
hereby
constituted
an
university
by
the
name
and
under
the
title
of
the
university
of
maryland
the
connection
with
the
medical
and
chirurgical
faculty
was
severed
and
the
members
of
the
four
faculties
under
the
name
of
the
regents
of
the
university
of
maryland
were
to
have
full
powers
over
the
university
and
be
permitted
to
hold
property
not
exceeding
in
yearly
value
each
faculty
was
allowed
to
appoint
its
own
professors
and
lecturers
to
choose
a
dean
and
to
exercise
such
powers
as
the
regents
shall

together
with
three
of
the
principals
of
any
three
academies
or
colleges
of
the
state
such
a
strangely
formed
and
loosely
united
body
could
not
succeed
as
a
more
homogeneous
and
closely
compacted
one
would
have
done
the
university
was
founded
on
the
most
liberal
plan
for
the
benefit
of
students
of
every
country
and
every
religious
denomination
who
shall
be
freely
admitted
to
equal
privileges
and
advantages
of
education
and
to
all
the
honors
of
the
university
according
to
their
merit
without
requiring
or
enforcing
any
religious
or
civil
test
urging
their
attendance
upon
any
particular
plan
of
religious
worship
or
service
with
these
broad
powers
and
provisions
the
faculty
of
phisick
late
of
the
college
of
medicine
of
maryland
convened
and
by
the
authority
vested
in
it
by
said
charter
and
with
the
advice
and
recommendations
of
learned
men
of
the
several
professions
of
divinity
law
and
the
arts
and
sciences
proceeded
to
annex
to
itself
the
other
three
faculties
on
april
the
hon
robert
smith
formerly
united
states
secretary
of
state
was
chosen
the
first
provost
and
the
organization
of
the
regents
was
completed
a
lottery
of
was
granted
the
university
in
and
another
of
in
from
the
proceeds
of
these
lotteries
and
other
sources
was
built
the
building
of
the
medical
department
on
the
corner
of
lombard
and
greene
streets
it
was
modelled
on
the
pantheon
at
rome
and
when
built
is
said
to
have
been
without
an
equal
in
america
the
medical
school
grew
extremely
fast
a
loan
of
from
the
state
in
enabled
it
to
build
a
practice
hall
and
purchase
a
fine
collection
for
its
museum
and
the
university
hospital
across
the
street
was
opened
in
in
the
number
of
students
in
attendance
on
lectures
amounted
to
the
other
faculties
took
no
active
steps
for
some
time
and
not
until
did
the
regents
urge
them
to
proceed
to
deliver
lectures
as
soon
as
possible
and
to
lay
before
the
regents
annually
a
report
as
to
their
progress
and
condition
in
possibly
on
account
of
this
vote
david
hoffman
began
the
instruction
in
the
faculty
of
law
his
school
being
known
as
the
maryland
law
institute
he
published
part
of
his
lecture
notes
in
a
book
called
and
continued
lecturing
about
ten
years
after
his
withdrawal
the
law
school
was
given
up
but
the
organization
of
the
faculty
was
still
maintained
the
faculty
of
theology
reported
in
no
active
organization
of
the
faculty
has
ever
been
attempted
and
in
view
of
the
character
of
the
department
contemplated
by
the
charter
none
seems
desirable
its
only
activity
was
a
course
or
two
of
lectures
on
the
evidences
of
christianity
delivered
before
the
medical
students
about
by
the
rev
william
wyatt
professor
of
theology
a
nominal
organization
of
the
faculty
was
kept
up
however
until
the
prosperity
of
the
medical
department
was
destroyed
by
the
effort
of
some
of
its
professors
discontented
with
being
prohibited
from
having
private
classes
to
have
the
legislature
do
away
with
the
regents
and
replace
them
with
a
board
of
trustees
in
whom
should
vest
the
property
as
early
as
november
the
regents
feared
trouble
and
obtained
from
william
wirt
john
purviance
and
daniel
webster
a
legal
opinion
that
their
position
was
inexpugnable
with
this
conclusion
the
legislature
did
not
agree
and
on
march
an
act
was
passed
abolishing
the
regents
and
appointing
a
board
of
trustees
in
their
place
the
trustees
by
decree
of
the
courts
obtained
control
of
the
property
and
forced
the
professors
to
accept
them
as
the
legal
authority
so
matters
went
on
for
twelve
years
until
in
the
trustees
appointed
a
professor
personally
objectionable
to
some
of
the
others
who
resigned
their
positions
under
the
trustees
and
opened
a
separate
medical
school
in
the
indian
queen
hotel
at
the
corner
of
baltimore
and
hanover
streets
few
students
attended
either
school
for
the
quarrel
frightened
them
away
and
the
baltimore
students
largely
attended
the
regents
school
feeling
ran
high
at
one
time
the
regents
took
possession
of
the
university
buildings
by
force
and
bloodshed
was
feared
the
board
of
regents
reorganized
with
ashton
alexander
as
provost
and
employed
distinguished
counsel
to
plead
the
case
for
them
in
the
courts
the
legislature
authorized
the
court
of
appeals
to
try
the
suit
and
maryland
dartmouth
college
case
was
decided
in
june
entirely
in
favor
of
the
regents
the
court
held
that
the
act
of
was
void
since
it
was
a
judicial
act
a
sentence
that
condemned
without
a
hearing
the
legislature
has
no
right
without
the
assent
of
a
corporation
to
alter
its
charter
or
take
from
it
any
of
its
franchises
or
property
the
trustees
would
not
yield
at
once
and
in
march
presented
a
petition
to
the
legislature
praying
it
not
to
pass
an
act
requiring
them
to
give
up
the
property
to
the
regents
the
memorial
was
referred
to
a
joint
committee
which
reported
a
bill
restoring
the
property
to
the
regents
the
bill
was
enacted
and
the
regents
have
since
ruled
during
the
supremacy
of
the
trustees
the
faculty
of
the
arts
and
sciences
was
organized
they
contemplated
activity
in
and
issued
a
circular
which
drew
down
on
them
the
wrath
of
professor
hoffman
inasmuch
as
they
contemplated
instruction
not
intended
by
the
charter
the
founders
he
said
intended
that
instruction
should
be
conveyed
by
lectures
and
that
no
other
form
of
instruction
should
be
allowed
the
discussion
which
followed
seems
to
show
that
he
had
the
idea
of
having
work
carried
on
like
that
done
by
graduate
students
but
nothing
was
done
apparently
until
baltimore
college
was
annexed
in
that
institution
was
chartered
on
january
and
was
the
development
of
an
academy
kept
by
james
priestley
the
first
president
on
paul
lane
paul
street
it
was
hoped
that
it
would
together
with
the
other
valuable
seminaries
of
education
in
the
same
city
and
in
the
state
become
adequate
to
the
wants
and
wishes
of
our
citizens
and
from
the
proceeds
of
a
lottery
the
grant
of
which
was
an
easy
way
for
a
state
to
be
benevolent
a
plain
but
convenient
building
was
erected
on
mulberry
street
it
is
very
doubtful
if
it
ever
graduated
any
students
and
we
learn
in
that
the
celebrity
and
in
some
cases
the
superior
existing
advantages
of
other
institutions
have
prevented
the
accomplishment
of
this
object
still
a
school
had
been
kept
up
continuously
and
from
time
to
time
we
catch
glimpses
of
its
lectures
in
january
a
joint
petition
of
the
trustees
of
the
university
of
maryland
and
of
baltimore
college
to
the
legislature
proposed
the
charter
of
baltimore
college
shall
be
surrendered
to
the
state
on
the
condition
that
the
property
belonging
to
the
college
shall
be
invested
in
the
trustees
of
the
university
of
maryland
the
petition
was
granted
and
in
we
learn
that
the
baltimore
college
has
now
been
merged
in
the
university
of
maryland
and
constitutes
the
chair
of
ancient
languages
on
october
the
trustees
issued
a
prospectus
from
which
we
learn
that
it
was
intended
to
maintain
an
institution
on
the
most
enlarged
scale
of
usefulness
and
responsibility
and
that
there
was
a
necessity
for
the
proposed
organization
of
a
department
in
the
university
of
maryland
exclusively
collegiate
in
its
system
requiring
an
advanced
state
of
classical
and
scientific
attainments
for
admission
to
its
lectures
calculated
to
conduct
its
pupils
through
the
highest
branches
of
a
liberal
education
and
to
afford
them
advantages
similar
to
what
may
be
obtained
in
the
distant
universities
of
this
country
and
europe
a
course
of
study
equal
to
that
of
any
college
of
the
country
was
announced
and
a
brilliant
faculty
appointed
but
the
time
was
not
yet
come
for
a
great
college
in
baltimore
and
the
institution
languished
away
in
the
commissioners
of
public
schools
petitioned
to
have
it
transferred
to
the
city
as
a
high
school
and
in
it
had
only
one
teacher
and
scholars
a
mere
boys
school
in
it
was
reorganized
as
the
school
of
letters
under
the
faculty
of
arts
and
sciences
with
rev
dalrymple
formerly
of
the
episcopal
theological
seminary
at
alexandria
as
its
head
on
paper
the
course
was
fairly
complete
and
the
faculty
an
able
one
and
there
were
graduates
in
and
the
course
was
to
be
a
three
years
one
for
the
studies
of
freshman
year
will
be
pursued
in
the
preparatory
department
where
experience
has
shown
they
may
be
attended
with
greater
advantage
gradually
students
fell
off
it
became
a
mere
boys
school
and
finally
dalrymple
was
all
that
was
left
of
the
school
of
letters
and
the
faculty
of
the
arts
and
sciences
and
at
his
death
both
formally
became
extinct
with
the
restoration
of
the
property
to
the
regents
the
classes
in
the
medical
school
increased
to
a
size
somewhat
like
that
attained
in
years
previous
to
although
owing
to
the
opening
of
new
schools
they
never
quite
equalled
it
during
the
war
of
the
rebellion
the
school
suffered
from
the
loss
of
southern
patronage
but
at
its
close
students
came
back
and
the
school
took
on
fresh
life
it
has
always
been
in
the
front
rank
first
of
all
american
medical
schools
it
recognized
gynecology
as
a
separate
branch
of
instruction
and
it
was
second
in
making
practical
anatomy
a
compulsory
study
with
the
session
of
it
will
require
a
three
years
graded
course
of
all
candidates
for
degrees
in
the
hon
john
kennedy
statesman
and
author
was
chosen
provost
and
on
his
death
in
the
hon
teackle
wallis
was
made
his
successor
and
he
now
fills
the
office
with
honor
the
faculty
of
law
revived
the
law
school
in
the
beginning
of
with
a
class
of
an
efficient
faculty
has
caused
a
steady
increase
until
in
there
were
students
in
the
three
years
course
the
instruction
is
given
by
lectures
examinations
and
in
the
law
department
moved
from
its
former
quarters
in
the
old
baltimore
college
building
on
mulberry
street
to
a
new
building
erected
for
it
on
the
university
property
on
lombard
street
next
to
the
building
of
the
medical
department
in
the
university
of
maryland
obtained
from
the
legislature
authority
to
open
a
dental
department
in
the
first
dental
lectures
in
america
had
been
delivered
before
the
medical
students
of
the
university
and
it
was
quite
fitting
that
there
should
be
a
dental
school
connected
with
it
the
first
class
numbered
the
last
and
in
eight
years
there
have
been
graduates
this
fact
and
the
further
one
that
twice
has
it
been
found
necessary
to
make
large
additions
to
the
buildings
of
the
department
on
green
street
adjoining
those
of
the
medical
school
will
show
how
rapid
has
been
its
growth
the
university
has
at
present
flourishing
departments
of
medicine
law
and
dentistry
and
worthily
maintains
the
reputation
of
thorough
and
careful
training
which
it
has
gained
in
its
history
of
eighty
years
cokesbury
college
in
maryland
was
the
first
methodist
church
in
america
and
it
was
natural
that
here
too
should
be
the
first
methodist
college
in
the
world
there
was
no
permanent
organization
of
this
denomination
in
the
united
states
until
john
wesley
on
the
petition
of
the
american
churches
consecrated
rev
thomas
coke
superintendent
for
the
united
states
in
coke
sailed
directly
from
england
and
arrived
in
new
york
on
november
he
thence
traveled
southward
and
on
the
of
the
same
month
met
francis
asbury
at
dover
delaware
at
this
first
meeting
coke
suggested
the
founding
of
an
institution
for
higher
education
to
be
under
the
patronage
of
the
methodist
church
this
was
not
a
new
idea
to
asbury
for
four
years
previous
to
this
meeting
john
dickins
had
made
the
same
suggestion
to
him
the
earlier
idea
had
contemplated
only
a
school
on
the
plan
of
wesley
at
knightwood
england
and
for
that
purpose
a
subscription
had
been
opened
in
north
carolina
in
coke
suggestion
to
have
a
college
was
favorably
received
and
at
the
famous
christmas
conference
at
baltimore
in
the
church
was
formally
organized
with
coke
and
asbury
as
bishops
and
the
first
methodist
college
was
founded
thus
the
denomination
which
has
increased
to
be
the
largest
in
the
united
states
recognized
the
paramount
importance
of
education
at
its
very
foundation
to
the
new
institution
the
name
of
cokesbury
was
given
in
honor
of
the
two
bishops
from
whose
names
the
title
was
compounded
for
this
college
collections
were
yearly
taken
amounting
in
to
and
implying
great
by
the
struggling
churches
with
wealth
as
early
as
january
only
two
weeks
after
the
college
was
decided
on
its
managers
were
able
to
report
that
had
been
subscribed
a
sum
that
put
the
enterprise
on
a
firm
footing
the
site
was
next
to
be
chosen
and
abingdon
in
harford
county
was
pitched
upon
of
the
methodists
in
the
union
in
over
were
in
maryland
and
hence
it
had
the
best
claim
for
the
college
and
the
beauty
of
the
situation
of
abingdon
charmed
coke
so
much
that
he
determined
upon
placing
the
college
there
it
was
also
a
place
easy
of
access
being
on
the
direct
stage
line
from
baltimore
to
philadelphia
and
near
the
chesapeake
bay
bishop
coke
the
most
zealous
advocate
of
the
college
contracted
for
the
building
materials
but
was
prevented
from
being
present
at
the
laying
of
the
bishop
asbury
however
was
present
and
preached
a
sermon
on
psalms
verses
to
in
this
sermon
he
dwelt
on
the
importance
of
a
thoroughly
religious
education
and
looked
forward
to
the
effects
which
would
result
to
the
generality
to
come
from
the
streams
which
should
spring
from
this
opening
fountain
of
sanctified
learning
the
building
was
built
of
brick
one
hundred
feet
in
length
and
forty
in
width
faced
east
and
west
and
stood
on
the
summit
and
centre
of
six
acres
of
land
with
an
equal
proportion
of
ground
on
each
side
it
was
said
to
be
in
architecture
fully
equal
if
not
superior
to
anything
of
the
kind
in
the
country
dormitory
accommodations
were
provided
in
the
building
but
it
was
intended
that
as
many
of
the
students
as
possible
shall
be
lodged
and
boarded
in
the
town
of
abingdon
among
our
pious
friends
gardening
working
in
wood
in
a
building
called
the
taberna
lignaria
bathing
under
supervision
of
a
master
walking
and
riding
were
the
only
outdoor
exercises
permitted
the
students
were
prohibited
from
indulging
in
anything
which
the
world
calls
play
let
this
rule
be
observed
with
the
strictest
nicety
for
those
who
play
when
they
are
young
will
play
when
they
are
old
in
the
bishops
issued
a
plan
for
erecting
a
college
intended
to
advance
religion
in
america
it
is
quite
long
and
many
of
its
provisions
are
very
quaint
from
it
we
learn
that
cokesbury
is
intended
to
receive
for
education
and
board
the
sons
of
the
elders
and
preachers
of
the
methodist
episcopal
church
poor
orphans
and
the
sons
of
the
subscribers
and
other
friends
it
will
be
expected
that
all
our
friends
who
send
their
children
to
the
college
will
if
they
be
able
pay
a
moderate
sum
for
their
education
and
board
the
others
will
be
taught
and
boarded
and
if
our
finances
allow
it
clothed
gratis
the
institution
is
also
intended
for
the
benefit
of
our
young
men
who
are
called
to
preach
that
they
may
receive
a
measure
of
that
improvement
which
is
highly
expedient
as
a
preparation
for
public
service
teachers
of
ancient
languages
and
of
english
will
be
provided
and
no
necessary
branch
of
literature
shall
be
omitted
above
all
especial
care
shall
be
taken
that
due
attention
be
paid
to
the
religion
and
morals
of
the
children
and
to
the
exclusion
of
all
such
as
continue
of
an
ungovernable
temper
the
expense
of
such
an
undertaking
will
be
very
large
and
the
best
means
we
could
think
of
at
our
late
conference
to
accomplish
our
design
was
to
desire
the
assistance
of
all
those
in
every
place
who
wish
well
to
the
cause
of
god
the
students
will
be
instructed
in
english
latin
greek
logic
rhetoric
history
geography
natural
philosophy
and
astronomy
to
these
languages
and
sciences
shall
be
added
when
the
finances
of
our
college
will
admit
of
it
the
hebrew
french
and
german
languages
but
our
first
object
shall
be
to
answer
the
designs
of
education
by
forming
the
minds
of
the
youth
through
divine
aid
to
wisdom
and
holiness
by
instilling
into
their
minds
the
principles
of
true
religion
speculative
experimental
and
practical
and
training
them
in
the
ancient
way
that
they
may
be
rational
spiritual
christians
we
have
consented
to
receive
children
of
seven
years
of
age
as
we
wish
to
have
the
opportunity
of
teaching
young
idea
how
to
shoot
and
gradually
forming
their
minds
through
the
divine
blessing
almost
from
their
infancy
to
holiness
and
heavenly
wisdom
as
well
as
human
learning
we
shall
rigidly
insist
on
their
rising
early
in
the
morning
five
and
we
are
convinced
by
constant
observation
and
experience
that
it
is
of
vast
importance
both
to
body
and
mind
we
prohibit
play
in
the
strongest
terms
and
in
this
we
have
the
two
greatest
writers
on
the
subject
that
perhaps
any
age
has
produced
locke
and
rousseau
of
our
sentiments
for
though
the
latter
was
essentially
mistaken
in
his
religious
system
yet
his
wisdom
in
other
respects
and
extensive
genius
are
indisputably
acknowledged
the
employments
therefore
which
we
have
chosen
for
the
recreation
of
the
students
are
such
as
are
of
greatest
public
utility
agriculture
and
architecture
in
conformity
to
this
sentiment
one
of
the
completest
poetic
pieces
of
antiquity
the
georgics
of
virgil
is
written
on
the
subject
of
husbandry
by
the
perusal
of
which
and
submission
to
the
above
regulations
the
students
may
delightfully
unite
the
theory
and
practice
together
there
is
something
extremely
ludicrous
in
the
idea
of
making
the
average
student
delight
in
spending
his
leisure
hours
in
farming
by
means
of
a
study
of
the
georgics
in
the
original
but
we
can
hardly
laugh
at
these
men
they
were
too
much
in
earnest
to
return
to
the
circular
the
four
guineas
a
year
for
tuition
we
are
persuaded
can
not
be
lowered
if
we
give
the
students
that
finished
education
which
we
are
determined
they
shall
have
and
though
our
principal
object
is
to
instruct
them
in
the
doctrines
spirit
and
practice
of
christianity
yet
we
trust
that
our
college
will
in
due
time
send
forth
men
that
will
be
a
blessing
to
their
country
in
every
laudable
office
and
employment
of
life
thereby
uniting
the
two
greatest
ornaments
of
human
beings
which
are
too
often
separated
and
as
soon
as
the
building
was
under
roof
a
preparatory
school
was
opened
and
the
trustees
applied
to
john
wesley
for
a
president
he
suggested
a
rev
heath
and
this
suggestion
was
accepted
on
december
his
inauguration
occurred
a
year
later
and
was
a
grand
affair
asbury
presided
on
each
of
the
three
days
of
the
ceremony
and
his
text
on
the
second
day
o
man
of
god
there
is
death
in
the
pot
was
looked
on
by
the
superstitious
in
time
to
come
as
a
presage
of
disaster
the
faculty
was
filled
up
and
all
seemed
to
bid
fair
for
prosperity
but
heath
remained
in
charge
of
the
college
less
than
a
year
resigning
because
of
certain
charges
of
insufficiency
which
seem
rather
trival
another
professor
left
to
go
into
business
and
soul
was
tried
by
these
heavy
tidings
the
good
bishop
was
indefatigable
in
his
care
of
cokesbury
his
visits
were
frequent
and
while
there
he
was
very
active
examining
the
pupils
preaching
and
arranging
the
affairs
both
temporal
and
spiritual
abingdon
became
a
centre
of
methodism
families
moved
there
to
enjoy
the
educational
advantages
and
the
conference
regularly
visited
the
college
coming
over
from
baltimore
for
that
purpose
jacob
hall
of
abingdon
was
the
second
president
and
had
under
him
a
faculty
of
three
professors
and
a
chaplain
the
school
prospered
and
had
public
exhibitions
of
its
students
proficiency
from
time
to
time
it
is
doubtful
if
sufficient
care
was
exercised
in
the
expenditure
of
money
and
in
december
the
trustees
felt
obliged
to
contract
a
loan
of
the
charitable
contributions
fell
off
and
asbury
was
forced
to
go
from
house
to
house
in
baltimore
through
the
snow
and
cold
begging
money
for
the
support
of
the
poor
orphans
at
cokesbury
the
instruction
was
good
and
asbury
could
write
to
coke
then
in
england
that
one
promising
young
man
has
gone
forth
into
the
ministry
another
is
ready
and
several
have
been
under
awakenings
none
so
healthy
and
orderly
as
our
children
and
some
promise
great
talents
for
learning
still
all
was
not
well
there
and
on
october
he
found
matters
in
a
poor
state
at
college
in
debt
and
our
employes
in
arrears
a
year
later
matters
were
desperate
and
the
good
bishop
wrote
that
we
now
make
a
sudden
and
dead
pause
we
mean
to
incorporate
and
breathe
and
take
some
better
plan
if
we
can
not
have
a
christian
school
a
school
under
christian
discipline
and
pious
teachers
we
will
have
none
the
project
of
incorporation
was
not
favored
by
some
who
feared
that
the
college
would
not
be
thereby
so
directly
under
the
control
of
the
conference
but
was
carried
through
and
the
charter
bears
date
december
by
it
the
institution
was
allowed
to
have
an
income
not
exceeding
how
a
charter
was
to
avoid
increased
indebtedness
does
not
appear
and
the
college
debt
had
so
increased
that
the
conference
in
decided
to
suspend
the
collegiate
department
and
have
only
an
english
free
school
kept
in
the
buildings
misfortunes
never
come
singly
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
burn
the
buildings
had
been
made
in
the
fall
of
and
now
on
december
a
completely
successful
one
was
made
and
the
building
and
its
contents
were
consumed
rewards
to
discover
the
incendiary
were
offered
in
vain
and
asbury
writes
we
have
a
second
and
confirmed
report
that
cokesbury
college
is
consumed
to
ashes
a
sacrifice
of
in
about
ten
years
if
any
man
should
give
me
to
do
and
suffer
again
what
i
have
done
for
that
house
i
would
not
do
it
the
lord
called
not
whitefield
nor
the
methodists
to
build
colleges
i
wished
only
for
schools
coke
wanted
a
college
i
feel
distressed
at
the
loss
of
the
library
asbury
despaired
but
coke
did
not
and
going
to
work
he
raised
from
his
friends
after
the
determination
was
made
to
move
the
college
to
baltimore
the
church
there
gave
and
a
house
to
house
solicitation
brought
in
more
a
building
originally
erected
for
balls
and
assemblies
was
purchased
and
fitted
up
it
stood
next
the
old
light
street
methodist
church
and
a
school
was
opened
therein
on
may
the
high
course
planned
for
girls
is
especially
noticeable
at
this
early
period
the
school
opened
with
promises
of
success
and
within
a
month
there
were
nearly
scholars
fatality
pursued
the
enterprise
however
and
a
year
to
a
day
from
the
burning
of
the
first
building
this
second
one
was
reduced
to
ashes
with
the
adjoining
church
and
several
houses
asbury
writes
rather
philosophically
i
conclude
god
loveth
the
people
of
baltimore
and
he
will
keep
them
poor
to
make
them
pure
but
even
coke
gave
up
hope
at
this
new
disaster
and
it
was
twenty
years
before
a
second
methodist
college
was
attempted
asbury
college
this
was
the
second
methodist
college
in
the
world
and
was
organized
in
the
year
of
bishop
asbury
death
after
a
year
or
two
of
successful
work
a
charter
was
applied
for
and
it
was
granted
to
the
college
february
the
president
samuel
jennings
a
methodist
local
preacher
was
a
rather
remarkable
man
coming
from
new
jersey
graduating
at
rutgers
and
settling
in
the
practice
of
the
medical
profession
in
virginia
he
was
converted
by
the
preaching
of
asbury
and
was
persuaded
by
him
some
years
later
to
move
to
baltimore
and
take
the
leadership
of
the
new
enterprise
he
was
said
to
be
at
one
time
the
only
methodist
preacher
with
a
collegiate
education
and
was
well
adapted
to
the
task
from
his
administrative
ability
and
wide
learning
around
him
he
gathered
an
undenominational
faculty
of
four
professors
and
began
the
life
of
the
institution
in
a
large
brick
building
on
the
corner
of
park
avenue
and
franklin
street
in
march
the
tells
us
that
there
were
one
hundred
and
seventy
students
and
that
the
asbury
college
has
probably
exceeded
in
its
progress
considering
the
short
time
it
has
been
established
any
literary
institution
in
the
country
in
that
spring
a
class
was
graduated
and
yet
only
a
few
months
later
bangs
wrote
that
the
college
continued
for
a
short
time
and
then
greatly
to
the
disappointment
and
mortification
of
its
friends
went
down
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
up
and
asbury
college
lives
only
in
the
recollection
of
those
who
rejoiced
over
its
rise
and
mourned
over
its
fall
this
statement
is
not
absolutely
correct
it
is
probable
that
there
was
some
catastrophe
and
possibly
jennings
then
began
to
break
away
from
the
methodist
episcopal
church
which
he
left
entirely
when
the
methodist
protestant
church
was
formed
in
still
some
sort
of
an
organization
was
kept
up
under
the
old
name
for
does
not
good
hezekiah
niles
of
register
fame
tell
us
of
examinations
and
exhibitions
he
witnessed
in
the
early
spring
of
at
which
time
prodigies
of
learning
and
cramming
were
exhibited
and
do
we
not
find
in
a
pamphlet
published
by
jennings
entitled
remarks
on
the
subject
of
education
to
which
are
added
the
general
rules
of
the
school
under
the
appellation
of
asbury
college
apparently
the
college
had
passed
entirely
out
of
the
control
of
the
church
and
having
lowered
its
grade
was
now
little
more
than
jennings
private
school
the
school
was
then
situated
on
the
corner
of
charles
and
baltimore
streets
and
in
when
we
catch
the
last
glimpse
of
it
another
removal
had
taken
it
to
the
corner
of
south
and
fayette
streets
it
was
then
merely
a
day
school
and
doubtless
soon
perished
so
the
second
methodist
college
failed
as
the
first
had
done
and
another
was
added
to
the
many
abortive
attempts
to
found
a
college
in
maryland
other
extinct
colleges
three
other
attempts
to
found
colleges

a
passing
notice

at
the
corner
of

and
north

and
was
charted
as
a
college
in
the

constructed
by
the
baltimore
branch
of
the
united
states
bank
in
during
an
epidemic
of
yellow
fever
in
the
city
people
feared
to
come
into
town
to
transact
business
and
so
a
suburban
banking
house
was
built
this
building
was
bought
by
the
rev
frederick
hall
in
and
in
it
a
school
was
begun
which
was
later
expanded
into
the
college
the
institution
lasted
some
ten
years
and
is
worthy
of
note
from
the
fact
that
among
the
teachers
were
two
young
yale
graduates
who
afterwards
obtained
considerable
renown
professor
elias

and

dutton
college
of
was
situated
in
washington
county
and
was
originally
intended
by
its
founder
bishop
whittingham
as
a
preparatory
school
it
was
opened
in
october
with
rev
kerfoot
afterwards
bishop
of
pittsburg
as
principal
and
had
such
speedy
and
encouraging
success
that
it
was
chartered
as
a
college
in
under
the
control
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
the
college
prospered
greatly
under
bishop
kerfoot
able
management
and
was
kept
up
during
the
war
of
the
rebellion
in
spite
of
the
loss
of
southern
students
a
large
portion
of
the
entire
number
in
however

of
the
confederate

invaded
maryland
and
took
kerfoot
and

prisoners
and
the
college
thus
forcibly
discontinued
was
never
again
reorganized
was
chartered
by
the
legislature
on
march
and
was
situated
on
lexington
street
between
north
and
calvert
it
was
originally
intended
to
combine
the
baltimore
preparatory
schools
and
to
furnish
boys
graduating
from
them
the
means
of
completing
their
education
without
leaving
the
city
there
was
an
enormous
list
of
trustees
and
the
unwieldy
character
of
the
board
coupled
with
the
irregular
habits
of
the
president
made
the
failure
of
the
enterprise
inevitable
still
it
offered
in
its
catalogues
a
good
course
of
study
and
gave
exhibitions
at
which
polyglot
orations
were
delivered
the
late
perley

was
the
life
of
the
institution
and
after
several
classes
had
graduated
the
university
finally
ceased
to
be
when
lovejoy
accepted
a
position
as
professor
in
the
baltimore
city
college
roman
catholic

maryland
has
been
the
cradle
of
the
roman
catholic
church
in
america
as
well
as
of
the
methodist
and
the
presbyterian
the
centenary
of
the
consecration
of
john
carroll
as
the
first
roman
catholic
bishop
in
the
united
states
occurred
little
more
than
a
year
ago
a
few
months
after
bishop
carroll
consecration
he
received
from
the
superior
of
the
order
of
sulpice
an
offer
to
found
a
seminary
in
baltimore
for
the
education
of
priests
this
offer
was
accepted
and
on
july
four
sulpician
priests
arrived
in
baltimore
they
soon
bought
a
house
known
as
one
mile
tavern
with
four
acres
of
land
and
there
they
opened
mary
on
the
first
sunday
in
october
the
seminary
still
occupies
the
same
site
at
the
corner
of
paca
and
mary
streets
the
number
of
the
candidates
for
the
priesthood
who
entered
the
seminary
was
disappointing
from
its
smallness
and
in
order
to
procure
clerics
an
academy
was
opened
in
the
rooms
of
the
seminary
on
august
this
was
presided
over
by
rev
wm
du
bourg
and
proved
so
successful
as
to
demand
a
separate
building
accordingly
the
of
mary
college
was
laid
on
april
at
bishop
carroll
request
no
american
boys
were
admitted
for
a
time
and
only
spaniards
and
french
were
received
in
however
the
college
was
opened
to
all
day
scholars
or
boarders
without
reference
to
birth
or
religion
this
step
roused
some
opposition
and
many
communications
upon
the
subject
appeared
in
the
newspapers
which
were
afterwards
collected
in
pamphlet
form
the
students
soon
became
numerous
and
the
institution
grew
to
such
an
extent
that
in
january
it
was
chartered
as
university
on
august
the
first
class
was
graduated
in
that
year
there
were
students
new
buildings
were
erected
and
a
superb
botanical
garden
was
laid
out
the
chapel
built
soon
after
the
incorporation
was
said
to
be
the
most
beautiful
in
the
united
states
the
rev
william
du
bourg
the
president
was
a
man
of
great
ability
and
the
reputation
of
the
college
rapidly
spread
many
prominent
men
roman
catholics
and
protestants
were
graduated
from
mary
but
the
sulpicians
felt
that
their
vocation
was
to
educate
young
men
exclusively
for
the
priesthood
and
not
for
secular
life
and
they
finally
closed
mary
college
in
in
order
to
devote
all
their
energies
to
the
theological
seminary
which
has
continued
its
prosperous
career
to
this
present
day
a
second
roman
catholic
college
was
formed
by
the
sulpicians
in
at
emmittsburg
frederick
county
it
was
begun
by
rev
john
dubois
and
was
soon
chartered
as
saint
mary
the
exercises
were
first
held
in
a
log
house
with
a
handful
of
pupils
who
increased
to
within
five
years
with
the
growth
of
the
institution
came
the
demand
for
larger
accommodations
better
buildings
were
erected
and
a
large
stone
edifice
was
undertaken
in
when
nearly
ready
for
occupancy
it
was
destroyed
by
fire
but
father
dubois
did
not
despair
and
aided
by
the
people
of
the
vicinity
at
once
began
a
new
building
in
he
was
appointed
bishop
of
new
york
and
in
the
same
year
the
connection
of
the
college
with
the
sulpician
order
was
terminated
although
originally
intended
chiefly
as
a
place
for
the
education
of
clerics
mt
mary
has
ever
kept
in
view
the
preparation
of
students
for
a
secular
life
and
many
of
its
graduates
have
been
distinguished
in
state
as
well
as
in
church
in
rev
john
mccaffrey
became
president
and
under
his
able
control
the
college
prospered
until
during
this
period
the
jubilee
of
the
institution
was
celebrated
with
great
ceremony
in
the
civil
war
injured
the
college
greatly
and
the
declaration
of
peace
found
it
burdened
with
a
heavy
load
of
debt
for
twenty
years
the
struggle
went
on
and
it
was
doubtful
all
the
time
whether
the
college
could
survive
finally
william
bryne
at
his
leaving
the
presidency
in
was
able
to
report
that
the
institution
was
placed
on
a
firm
financial
basis
as
to
the
future
and
that
the
debt
had
been
reduced
to
the
present
president
rev
edward
allen
has
still
further
diminished
the
debt
by
more
than
half
and
the
attendance
has
been
largely
increased
through
his
efficient
administration
a
third
roman
catholic
college
is
situated
in
howard
county
near
ellicott
city
it
is
situated
on
land
given
by
charles
carroll
of
carroll
ton
and
was
chartered
on
february
its
name
being
taken
from
that
of
its
founder
and
of
the
great
archbishop
of
milan
the
institution
was
placed
under
the
control
of
the
society
of
sulpice
and
was
established
exclusively
for
the
education
of
pious
young
men
of
the
catholic
persuasion
for
the
ministry
of
the
gospel
the
was
laid
by
the
venerable
charles
carroll
on
july
but
for
want
of
funds
to
carry
on
the
work
successfully
the
institution
was
not
opened
until
the
fall
of
the
first
president
rev
jenkins
began
the
institution
with
four
pupils
and
at
his
death
in
the
number
had
grown
to
since
the
closing
of
mary
college
in
charles
has
been
used
by
the
sulpicians
as
preparatory
to
mary
seminary
to
supply
the
want
of
a
college
to
which
baltimore
boys
of
roman
catholic
families
could
go
without
leaving
home
was
opened
in
september
it
is
under
the
control
of
the
jesuits
and
has
confined
itself
to
receiving
day
scholars
the
fifth
and
last
roman
catholic
college
was
chartered
in
it
is
situated
near
ellicott
city
as
is
charles
and
is
under
the
supervision
of
the
brothers
of
the
christian
schools
it
prepares
youth
for
the
various
duties
and
occupations
of
life
with
great
thoroughness
and
has
ever
been
noted
especially
for
the
attention
paid
to
the
development
of
the
body
as
well
as
the
mind
of
its
pupils
westeen
maryland
college
in
fayette
buell
began
an
academy
for
boys
and
girls
at
westminster
carroll
county
and
in
the
spring
of
he
proposed
to
the
conference
of
the
methodist
protestant
church
of
which
he
was
a
member
that
the
school
should
be
chartered
as
a
college
and
taken
under
the
church
patronage
this
proposition
was
not
acceded
to
but
buell
went
on
with
his
plan
confidence
in
the
rev
ward
one
of
the
teachers
in
buell
school
induced
two
of
his
friends
to
lend
the
enterprise
and
the
of
the
college
building
was
laid
on
september
the
college
opened
a
year
later
with
pupils
in
february
buell
found
himself
so
much
in
debt
that
he
appealed
to
the
conference
to
take
the
property
off
his
hands
this
was
done
and
a
board
of
trustees
appointed
by
the
conference
was
incorporated
by
the
legislature
on
march
the
next
fall
the
institution
reopened
with
rev
ward
as
president
in
which
office
he
continued
for
seventeen
years
these
were
years
of
trouble
and
severe
work
to
make
the
college
a
success
there
was
no
endowment
and
only
by
the
most
strenuous
efforts
was
the
college
saved
on
several
occasions
from
being
overwhelmed
with
debt
still
in
spite
of
all
disadvantages
good
work
was
done
and
valuable
experience
was
gained
the
college
has
been
a
one
from
the
first
and
connected
with
it
was
a
department
of
biblical
literature
for
such
as
intended
to
become
clergymen
until
a
separate
theological
school
was
opened
in
during
ward
administration
new
buildings
were
erected
and
at
his
resignation
in
he
left
the
institution
ready
to
be
made
still
more
efficient
by
his
successor
rev
thomas
lewis
succeeded
as
president
and
while
he
has
caused
the
work
and
equipment
of
the
college
to
be
further
enlarged
he
has
also
been
successful
in
paying
off
the
last
dollar
of
the
debt
that
had
hung
over
it
so
long
as
an
incubus
female
education
baltimore
female
so
long
presided
over
by
brooks
was
the
pioneer
institution
in
maryland
for
the
higher
education
of
women
founded
in
it
long
had
a
prosperous
existence
but
finally
was
obliged
to
close
its
doors
in
june
on
account
of
the
withdrawal
of
the
grant
formerly
given
by
the
state
besides
this
institution
there
was
no
successful
attempt
in
maryland
to
found
a
college
for
female
education
until
the
college
of
was
chartered
in
it
was
founded
by
the
methodist
episcopal
church
in
honor
of
the
centenary
of
its
organized
existence
in
this
country
and
is
denominational
but
not
sectarian
for
it
beautiful
buildings
adjoining
the
first
methodist
church
have
been
erected
on
paul
street
much
of
the
money
for
its
endowment
was
given
by
the
present
president
the
rev
goucher
and
largely
through
his
influence
was
it
able
to
open
its
doors
to
students
on
september
it
has
determined
very
sensibly
to
grant
no
degrees
save
to
those
thoroughly
fitted
to
receive
them
and
so
has
had
no
graduates
up
to
the
present
its
growth
under
the
care
of
hopkins
its
first
president
was
great
in
numbers
and
endowment
and
the
prospects
are
now
fair
for
this
baltimore
woman
college
taking
high
rank
among
similar
institutions
conclusion
to
a
superficial
observer
from
a
distance
it
sometimes
seems
as
if
university
education
in
maryland
began
with
the
foundation
of
the
johns
hopkins
university
a
sketch
of
which
follows
from
the
pen
of
its
honored
president
our
study
into
the
history
of
education
in
the
state
however
has
shown
us
that
maryland
instead
of
being
one
of
the
latest
of
the
united
states
to
conceive
the
university
idea
was
in
fact
one
of
the
very
earliest
and
that
her
institutions
have
a
history
of
which
they
need
not
be
ashamed
though
their
work
has
not
been
so
widely
known
as
some
others
and
though
the
bright
promise
of
morning
in
many
cases
has
not
been
followed
by
the
full
development
of
noontide
the
patient
labors
of
william
smith
of
hector
humphreys
of
francis
asbury
of
john
dubois
and
of
many
others
have
been
far
from
lost
wherein
they
failed
they
gained
valuable
experience
for
their
successors
and
wherein
they
succeeded
they
helped
to
instil
into
the
minds
and
hearts
of
the
citizens
the
principles
of
science
and
good
morals

the

taken
as
the
date
of
the
foundation
of
the
johns
hopkins
university
as
in
that
year
its
doors
were
opened
for
the
reception
of
students
on
the
of
february
the
plans
of
the
university
were
publicly
made
known
and
consequently
birthday
has
since
been
observed
as
an
anniversary
or
commemoration
day
but
in
reality
the
trustees
were
organized
nine
years
before
the
founder
johns
hopkins
as
he
saw
the
end
of
life
approaching
although
he
continued
in
active
business
for
several
years
afterwards
determined
to
bestow
a
large
part
of
his
fortune
upon
two
institutions
which
he
proposed
to
establish
a
university
and
a
hospital
these
establishments
were
to
be
managed
by
separate
boards
of
trustees
citizens
of
baltimore
whom
he
selected
for
their
integrity
wisdom
and
public
spirit
in
order
that
the
two
boards
might
be
closely
allied
the
founder
was
careful
that
a
majority
of
the
trustees
of
one
corporation
should
also
be
a
majority
of
the
trustees
of
the
other
corporation
and
in
a
letter
which
he
left
as
the
final
expression
of
his
wishes
he
declared
it
to
be
his
constant
wish
and
purpose
that
the
hospital
should
ultimately
form
a
part
of
the
medical
school
of
the
university
the
hospital
was
opened
for
the
reception
of
patients
in
may
and
a
volume
which
was
prepared
in
the
following
year
by

gives
a
full
description
of
the
buildings
with
other
papers
illustrative
of
the
history
and
purposes
of
that
great
charity
but
as
the
medical
school
which
is
to
form
the
bond
of
union
between
the
two
establishments
has
not
yet
been
organized
the
following
statements
will
only
refer
to
those
opportunities
which
are
here
provided
for
the
study
of
science
and
literature
in
the
faculty
commonly
known
as
the
faculty
of
philosophy
and
the
liberal
arts
before
speaking
of
his
gifts
a
few
words
should
be
devoted
to
the
memory
of
johns
hopkins
this
man
whose
name
is
now
renowned
in
the
annals
of
american
philanthropy
acquired
his
fortune
by
slow
and
sagacious
methods
he
was
born
in
anne
arundel
county
maryland
not
far
from
the
city
of
annapolis
of
a
family
which
for
several
generations
had
adhered
to
the
views
of
the
society
of
friends
his
ancestors
were
among
the
earliest
settlers
of
the
colony
while
still
a
boy
johns
hopkins
came
to
baltimore
without
any
capital
but
good
health
the
good
habits
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
and
unusual
capacity
for
a
life
of
industrious
enterprise
he
began
on
the
lowest
round
of
the
ladder
of
fortune
and
by
his
economy
fidelity
sagacity
and
perseverance
he
rose
to
independence
and
influence
he
was
called
to
many
positions
of
financial
responsibility
among
the
most
important
being
that
of
president
of
the
merchants
national
bank
and
that
of
a
director
in
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
company
he
was
a
man
of
positive
opinions
in
political
affairs
yet
he
never
entered
political
life
and
although
he
contributed
to
the
support
of
educational
and
benevolent
societies
he
was
not
active
in
their
management
in
the
latter
part
of
his
life
he
dwelt
during
the
winter
in
a
large
mansion
still
standing
on
the
north
side
of
saratoga
street
west
of
north
charles
street
and
during
the
summer
on
an
estate
called
clifton
in
baltimore
county
in
both
these
places
he
exercised
hospitality
without
ostentation
he
bought
a
large
library
and
many
oil
paintings
which
are
now
preserved
in
a
memorial
room
at
the
hospital
nevertheless
his
pursuits
were
wholly
mercantile
and
his
time
and
strength
were
chiefly
devoted
to
the
business
in
which
he
was
engaged
first
as
a
wholesale
grocer
and
afterwards
as
a
capitalist
interested
in
many
and
diverse
financial
undertakings
more
than
once
in
time
of
commercial
panic
he
lent
his
credit
to
the
support
of
individuals
and
firms
with
a
liberality
which
entitled
him
to
general
gratitude
he
died
in
baltimore
december
at
the
age
of
years
he
had
never
married
after
providing
for
his
near
relations
he
gave
the
principal
part
of
his
estate
to
the
two
institutions
which
bear
his
name
the
johns
hopkins
university
and
the
johns
hopkins
hospital
each
of
them
received
property
estimated
in
round
numbers
at
three
and
a
half
million
dollars
the
gift
to
the
university
included
his
estate
of
clifton
three
hundred
and
thirty
acres
of
land
fifteen
thousand
shares
of
the
common
stock
of
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
and
other
securities
which
were
valued
at
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
many
persons
have
expressed
surprise
that
hopkins
should
have
made
so
large
an
investment
in
one
corporation
but
the
stock
of
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
was
free
from
taxation
for
many
years
it
paid
a
dividend
of
ten
per
cent
per
annum
and
the
managers
of
whom
he
was
one
confidently
anticipated
that
a
large
stock
dividend
would
be
declared
at
an
early
day
hopkins
not
only
gave
to
the
university
all
the
common
stock
that
he
held
in
this
corporation
he
also
advised
that
the
trustees
should
not
dispose
of
it
nor
of
the
stock
accruing
thereon
by
way
of
increment
or
dividend
in
view
of
the
vibrations
to
which
this
stock
was
subjected
during
the
fifteen
years
subsequent
to
the
death
of
hopkins
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
it
was
his
will
that
linked
the
fortune
of
the
great
educational
institution
which
he
founded
to
the
fortune
of
another
corporation
in
which
he
had
the
highest
confidence
fortunately
the
crisis
into
which
this
union
led
has
been
successfully

they
entered
with
a
definite
purpose
on
the
work
for
which
they
were
associated
they
collected
a
small
but
excellent

were
favored
with
innumerable
suggestions

recommendations
from
those
who
knew
much
about
education

from
those
who
knew
little
and
they
invited
several
scholars

give

the

johns
hopkins
university
present
the
first
detailed
account
of
their
trust
of
the
difficulties
attending
the
discharge
of
their
duty
of
the
nice
balancing
of
judgment
of
the
careful
investigation
and
continued
labor
called
for
in
the
organization
of
the
university
this
is
not
the
place
to
speak
but
for
the
board
of
trustees
i
may
be
allowed
to
claim
the
credit
of
entire
devotion
to
the
work
and
a
sincere
desire
to
make
of
the
university
all
that
the
public
could
expect
from
the
generous
foundation
happily
our
action
is
unfettered
and
where
mistakes
occur
as
occur
they
must
the
will
and
power
are
at
hand
to
correct
them
we
may
say
that
the
university
birth
takes
place
today
and
i
do
not
think
it
mere
sentiment
should
we
dwell
with
interest
upon
its
concurrence
with
the
centennial
year
of
our
national
birth
and
the
birthday
of
him
who
led
the
nation
from
the
throes
of
battle
to
maturity
and
peace
but
it
is
not
my
province
to
detain
you
from
the
exercises
which
are
to
follow
i
am
happy
to
state
that
we
have
among
us
one
who
represents
the
highest
type
of
american
education
and
one
who
from
the
beginning
has
sympathized
with
counselled
and
aided
us
i
know
you
anticipate
me
as
i
announce
the
distinguished

cordially
greets
the

welcomes
a
worthy

an

strong
in
material

and
in
high

i
congratulate
you
gentlemen
trustees
of
the
johns
hopkins
university
upon
the
noble
work
which
is
before
you
a
great
property
an
important
part
of
the
fruit
of
a
long
life
devoted
with
energy
and
sagacity
to
the
accumulation
of
riches
has
been
placed
in
your
hands
upon
conditions
as
magnanimous
as
they
are
wise
to
be
used
for
the
public
benefit
in
providing
for
coming
generations
the
precious
means
of
liberal
culture
your
board
has
great
powers
it
must
hold
and
manage
the
property
of
the
university
make
all
appointments
fix
all
salaries
and
while
leaving
both
legislative
and
administrative
details
to
the
several
faculties
which
it
will
create
it
must
also
prescribe
the
general
laws
of
the
university
your
cares
and
labor
will
grow
heavy
as
time
goes
on
but
in
accordance
with
an
admirable
usage
fortunately
established
in
this
country
you
will
serve
without
other
compensation
than
the
public
consideration
which
will
justly
attach
to
your
office
and
the
happy
sense
of
being
useful
the
actuating
spirit
of
your
board
will
be
a
spirit
of
scrupulous
fidelity
to
every
trust
reposed
in
you
and
of
untiring
zeal
in
promoting
the
welfare
of
the
university
and
the
advancement
of
learning
judged
by
its
disinterestedness
its
beneficence
and
its
permanence
your
function
is
as
pure
and
high
as
any
that
the
world
knows
or
in
all
time
has
known
may
the
work
which
you
do
in
the
discharge
of
your
sacred
trust
be
regarded
with
sympathetic
and
expectant
forbearance
by
the
present
generation
and
with
admiration
and
gratitude
by
posterity
the
university
which
is
to
take
its
rise
in
the
splendid
benefaction
of
johns
hopkins
must
be
unsectarian
none
other
could
as
appropriately
be
established
in
the
city
named
for
the
catholic
founder
of
a
colony
to
which
all
christian
sects
were
welcomed
or
in
the
state
in
which
religious
toleration
was
expressly
declared
in
the
name
of
the
government
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
christian
world
there
is
a
too
common
opinion
that
a
college
or
university
which
is
not
denominational
must
therefore
be
irreligious
but
the
absence
of
sectarian
control
should
not
be
confounded
with
lack
of
piety
a
university
whose
officers
and
students
are
divided
among
many
sects
need
no
more
be
irreverent
and
irreligious
than
the
community
which
in
respect
to
diversity
of
creeds
it
resembles
it
would
be
a
fearful
portent
if
thorough
study
of
nature
and
of
man
in
all
his
attributes
and
works
such
as
befits
a
university
led
scholars
to
impiety
but
it
does
not
on
the
contrary
such
study
fills
men
with
humility
and
awe
by
bringing
them
on
every
hand
face
to
face
with
inscrutable
mystery
and
infinite
power
the
whole
work
of
a
university
is
uplifting
refining
and
spiritualizing
it
embraces
whatsoever
touches
life
with
upward
impulse
be
he
nowhere
else
god
is
in
all
that
liberates
and
lifts
in
all
that
humbles
sweetens
and
consoles
a
university
can
not
be
built
upon
a
sect
unless
indeed
it
be
a
sect
which
includes
the
whole
of
the
educated
portion
of
the
nation
this
university
will
not
demand
of
its
officers
and
students
the
creed
or
press
upon
them
the
doctrine
of
any
particular
religious
organization
but
none
the
less
i
should
better
say
all
the
more
it
can
exert
through
teachers
a
strong
moral
and
religious
influence
it
can
implant
in
the
young
breasts
of
its
students
exalted
sentiments
and
a
worthy
ambition
it
can
infuse
into
their
hearts
the
sense
of
honor
of
duty
and
of
responsibility
i
congratulate
the
city
of
baltimore
mayor
that
in
a
few
generations
she
will
be
the
seat
of
a
rich
and
powerful
university
to
her
citizens
its
grounds
and
buildings
will
in
time
become
objects
of
interest
and
pride
the
libraries
and
other
collections
of
a
university
are
storehouses
of
the
knowledge
already
acquired
by
mankind
from
which
further
invention
and
improvement
proceed
they
are
great
possessions
for
any
intelligent
community
the
tone
of
society
will
be
sensibly
affected
by
the
presence
of
a
considerable
number
of
highly
educated
men
whose
quiet
and
simple
lives
are
devoted
to
philosophy
and
teaching
to
the
exclusion
of
the
common
objects
of
human
pursuit
the
university
will
hold
high
the
standards
of
public
duty
and
public
spirit
and
will
enlarge
that
cultivated
class
which
is
distinguished
not
by
wealth
merely
but
by
refinement
and
spirituality
i
felicitate
the
state
of
maryland
whose
chief
magistrate
honors
this
assembly
with
his
presence
upon
the
establishment
within
her
borders
of
an
independent
institution
of
the
highest
education
the
elementary
school
is
not
more
necessary
to
the
existence
of
a
free
state
than
the
university
the
public
school
system
depends
upon
the
institutions
of
higher
education
and
could
not
be
maintained
in
real
efficiency
without
them
the
function
of
colleges
universities
and
professional
schools
is
largely
a
public
function
their
work
is
done
primarily
indeed
upon
individuals
but
ultimately
for
the
public
good
they
help
powerfully
to
form
and
mould
aright
the
public
character
and
that
public
character
is
the
foundation
of
everything
which
is
precious
in
the
state
including
even
its
material
prosperity
in
training
men
thoroughly
for
the
learned
professions
of
law
and
medicine
this
university
will
be
of
great
service
to
maryland
and
the
neighboring
states
during
the
past
forty
years
the
rules
which
governed
admission
to
these
honorable
and
confidential
professions
have
been
carelessly
relaxed
in
most
of
the
states
of
the
union
and
we
are
now
suffering
great
losses
and
injuries
both
material
and
moral
in
consequence
of
thus
thoughtlessly
abandoning
the
safer
ways
of
our
fathers
it
is
for
the
strong
universities
of
the
country
to
provide
adequate
means
of
training
young
men
well
for
the
learned
professions
and
to
set
a
high
standard
for
professional
degrees
president
gilman
this
distinguished
assembly
has
come
together
to
give
you
i
welcome
you
to
arduous
duties
and
grave
responsibilities
in
the
natural
course
of
life
you
will
not
see
any
large
part
of
the
real
fruits
of
your
labors
for
to
build
a
university
needs
not
years
only
but
generations
but
though
unfinished
will
weigh
on
the
doer
and
anxieties
will
sometimes
oppress
you
great
privileges
are
nevertheless
attached
to
your
office
it
is
a
precious
privilege
that
in
your
ordinary
work
you
will
have
to
do
only
with
men
of
refinement
and
honor
it
is
a
glad
and
animating
sight
to
see
successive
ranks
of
young
men
pressing
year
by
year
into
the
battle
of
life
full
of
hope
and
courage
and
each
year
better
armed
and
equipped
for
the
strife
it
is
a
privilege
to
serve
society
and
the
country
by
increasing
the
means
of
culture
but
above
all
you
will
have
the
great
happiness
of
devoting
yourself
for
life
to
a
noble
public
work
without
reserve
or
stint
or
thought
of
self
looking
for
no
advancement
for
nothing
again
knowing
well
by
experience
the
nature
of
the
charge
which
you
this
day
publicly
assume
familiar
with
its
cares
and
labors
its
hopes
and
fears
its
trials
and
its
triumphs
i
give
you
joy
of
the
work
to
which
you
are
called
and
welcome
you
to
a
service
which
will
task
your
every
power
the
true
greatness
of
states
lies
not
in
territory
revenue
population
commerce
crops
or
manufactures
but
in
immaterial
or
spiritual
tilings
in
the
purity
fortitude
and
uprightness
of
their
people
in
the
poetry
literature
science
and
art
which
they
give
birth
to
in
the
moral
worth
of
their
history
and
life
with
nations
as
with
individuals
none
but
moral
supremacy
is
immutable
and
forever
beneficent
universities
wisely
directed
store
up
the
intellectual
capital
of
the
race
and
become
fountains
of
spiritual
and
moral
power
therefore
our
whole
country
may
well
rejoice
with
you
that
you
are
auspiciously
founding
here
a
worthy
seat
of
learning
and
piety
here
may
young
feet
shunning
the
sordid
paths
of
low
desire
and
worldly
ambition
walk
humbly
in
the
steps
of
the
illustrious
dead
the
poets
artists
philosophers
and
statesmen
of
the
past
here
may
fresh
minds
explore
new
fields
and
increase
the
sum
of
knowledge
here
from
time
to
time
may
great
men
be
trained
up
to
be
leaders
of
the
people
here
may
the
irradiating
light
of
genius
sometimes
flash
out
to
rejoice
mankind
above
all
here
may
many
generations
of
manly
youth
learn
righteousness
inaugural
address
of
the
first
president
in
his
inaugural
address
the
president
of
the
johns
hopkins
university
after
a
grateful
reference
to
the
founder
and
his
generosity
and
a
reminder
that
the
endowment
large
as
it
appears
is
not
large
when
compared
with
the
acquisitions
of
many
other
institutions
called
attention
to
some
of
the
special
distinctions
of
this
gift
among
them
were
named
the
freedom
from
conditions
the
absence
of
political
or
ecclesiastical
control
the
connection
with
an
endowed
hospital
the
geographical
advantages
of
baltimore
and
the
timeliness
of
the
foundation
five
agencies
for
the
promotion
of
superior
instruction
were
next
briefly
discussed
universities
learned
academies
colleges
technical
schools
and
museums
the
object
of
these
paragraphs
was
to
suggest
the
distinctive
idea
of
the
university
and
to
show
that
while
forms
and
methods
vary
in
different
countries
the
freedom
for
investigation
the
obligation
to
teach
and
the
careful
bestowal
of
academic
honors
are
always
understood
to
be
among
the
university
functions
wherever
a
strong
university
is
established
learned
societies
colleges
technical
schools
and
museums
are
clustered
it
is
the
sun
and
they
are
the
planets
twelve
points
were
then
enumerated
on
which
there
is
a
consensus
so
general
that
further
discussion
seemed
needless
all
sciences
are
worthy
of
promotion
or
in
other
words
it
is
useless
to
dispute
whether
literature
or
science
should
receive
most
attention
or
whether
there
is
any
essential
difference
between
the
old
and
the
new
education
religion
has
nothing
to
fear
from
science
and
science
need
not
be
afraid
of
religion
religion
claims
to
interpret
the
word
of
god
and
science
to
reveal
the
laws
of
god
the
interpreters
may
blunder
but
truths
are
immutable
eternal
and
never
in
conflict
remote
utility
is
quite
as
worthy
to
be
thought
of
as
immediate
advantage
those
ventures
are
not
always
most
sagacious
that
expect
a
return
on
the
morrow
it
sometimes
pays
to
send
our
argosies
across
the
seas
to
make
investments
with
an
eye
to
slow
but
sure
returns
so
it
is
always
in
the
promotion
of
science
as
it
is
impossible
for
any
university
to
encourage
with
equal
freedom
all
branches
of
learning
a
selection
must
be
made
by
enlightened
governors
and
that
selection
must
depend
on
the
requirements
and
deficiencies
of
a
given
people
in
a
given
period
there
is
no
absolute
standard
of
preference
what
is
more
important
at
one
time
or
in
one
place
may
be
less
needed
elsewhere
and
otherwise
individual
students
can
not
pursue
all
branches
of
learning
and
must
be
allowed
to
select
under
the
guidance
of
those
who
are
appointed
to
counsel
them
nor
can
able
professors
be
governed
by
routine
teachers
and
pupils
must
be
allowed
great
freedom
in
their
method
of
work
recitations
lectures
examinations
laboratories
libraries
field
exercises
travel
are
all
legitimate
means
of
culture
the
best
scholars
will
almost
invariably
be
those
who
make
special
attainments
on
the
foundation
of
a
broad
and
liberal
culture
the
best
teachers
are
usually
those
who
are
free
competent
and
willing
to
make
original
researches
in
the
library
and
the
laboratory
the
best
investigators
are
usually
those
who
have
also
the
responsibilities
of
instruction
gaining
thus
the
incitement
of
colleagues
the
encouragement
of
pupils
the
observation
of
the
public
universities
should
bestow
their
honors
with
a
sparing
hand
their
benefits
most
freely
a
university
can
not
be
created
in
a
day
it
is
a
slow
growth
the
university
of
berlin
has
been
quoted
as
a
proof
of
the
contrary
that
was
indeed
a
quick
success
but
in
an
old
compact
country
crowded
with
learned
men
eager
to
assemble
at
the
prussian
court
it
was
a
change
of
base
rather
than
a
sudden
development
the
object
of
the
university
is
to
develop
character
to
make
men
it
misses
its
aim
if
it
produces
learned
pedants
or
simple
artisans
or
cunning
sophists
or
pretentious
practitioners
its
purport
is
not
so
much
to
impart
knowledge
to
the
pupils
as
to
whet
the
appetite
exhibit
methods
develop
powers
strengthen
judgment
and
invigorate
the
intellectual
and
moral
forces
it
should
prepare
for
the
service
of
society
a
class
of
students
who
will
be
wise
thoughtful
progressive
guides
in
whatever
department
of
work
or
thought
they
may
be
engaged
universities
easily
fall
into
ruts
almost
every
epoch
requires
a
fresh
start
if
these
twelve
points
are
conceded
our
task
is
simplified
though
it
is
still
difficult
it
is
to
apply
these
principles
to
baltimore
in
we
are
trying
to
do
this
with
no
controversy
as
to
the
relative
importance
of
letters
and
science
the
conflicts
of
religion
and
science
or
the
relation
of
abstractions
and
utilities
our
simple
aim
is
to
make
scholars
strong
bright
useful
and
true
proceeding
to
speak
of
the
johns
hopkins
university
the
speaker
then
announced
that
at
first
the
faculty
of
philosophy
would
alone
be
organized
where
instruction
would
be
given
in
language
mathematics
ethics
history
and
science
the
medical
faculty
would
not
long
be
delayed
that
of
jurisprudence
would
come
in
time
that
of
theology
is
not
now
proposed
the
next
paragraphs
of
the
address
will
be
given
without
abbreviation
who
shall
our
teachers
be
this
question
the
public
has
answered
for
us
for
i
believe
there
is
scarcely
a
preeminent
man
of
science
or
letters
at
home
or
abroad
who
has
not
received
a
popular
nomination
for
the
vacant
professorships
some
of
these
candidates
we
shall
certainly
secure
and
their
names
will
be
one
by
one
made
known
but
i
must
tell
you
in
domestic
confidence
that
it
is
not
an
easy
task
to
transplant
a
tree
which
is
deeply
rooted
it
is
especially
hard
to
do
so
in
our
soil
and
climate
though
a
migratory
people
our
college
professors
are
fixtures
such
local
college
attachments
are
not
known
in
germany
and
the
promotions
which
are
frequent
in
germany
are
less
thought
of
here
when
we
think
of
calling
foreign
teachers
we
encounter
other
difficulties
many
are
reluctant
to
cross
the
sea
and
others
are
by
reason
of
their
lack
of
acquaintance
with
our
language
and
ways
unavailable
besides
we
may
as
well
admit
that
london
paris
leipsic
berlin
and
vienna
afford
facilities
for
literary
and
scientific
growth
and
influence
far
beyond
what
our
country
affords
hence
it
is
probable
that
among
our
own
countrymen
our
faculty
will
be
chiefly
found
i
wrote
not
long
ago
to
an
eminent
physicist
presenting
this
problem
in
social
mechanics
for
which
i
asked
his
solution
we
can
not
have
a
great
university
without
great
professors
we
can
not
get
great
professors
till
we
have
a
great
university
help
us
from
the
dilemma
let
me
tell
his
answer
your
difficulty
he
says
applies
only
to
old
men
who
are
great
these
you
can
rarely
move
but
the
young
men
of
genius
talent
learning
and
promise
you
can
draw
they
should
be
your
strength
the
young
americans
of
talent
and
promise
there
is
our
strength
and
a
noble
company
they
are
we
do
not
ask
from
what
college
or
what
state
or
what
church
they
come
but
what
do
they
know
and
what
can
they
do
and
what
do
they
want
to
find
out
in
the
biographies
of
eminent
scholars
it
is
curious
to
observe
how
many
indicated
in
youth
preeminent
ability
isaac
casaubon
whose
name
in
the
sixteenth
century
shed
lustre
on
the
learned
circles
of
geneva
montpellier
paris
london
and
oxford
began
as
professor
of
greek
at
the
age
of
and
heinsius
his
leyden
contemporary
at
eighteen
it
was
at
the
age
of
that
linnaeus
first
published
his
cuvier
was
appointed
a
professor
in
paris
at
and
a
few
months
later
a
member
of
the
institute
james
kent
the
great
commentator
on
american
law
began
his
lectures
in
columbia
college
at
the
age
of
henry
was
not
far
from
thirty
years
of
age
when
he
made
his
researches
in
and
dana
great
work
on
mineralogy
was
first
published
before
he
was
years
old
and
about
four
years
after
he
graduated
at
new
haven
look
at
the
harvard
lists
everett
was
appointed
professor
of
greek
at
benjamin
peirce
of
mathematics
at
and
agassiz
was
not
yet
forty
when
he
came
to
this
country
for
fifty
years
yale
college
rested
on
three
men
selected
in
their
youth
by
dwight
and
almost
simultaneously
set
at
work
day
was
silliman
and
kingsley
when
they
began
their
professorial
lives
the
university
of
virginia
early
in
its
history
attracted
foreign
teachers
who
were
all
young
men
we
shall
hope
to
secure
a
strong
staff
of
young
men
appointing
them
because
they
have
twenty
years
before
them
selecting
them
on
evidence
of
their
ability
increasing
constantly
their
emoluments
and
promoting
them
because
of
their
merit
to
successive
posts
as
scholars
fellows
assistants
adjuncts
professors
and
university
professors
this
plan
will
give
us
an
opportunity
to
introduce
some
of
the
features
of
the
english
fellowship
and
the
german
system
of
or
in
other
words
to
furnish
positions
where
young
men
desirous
of
a
university
career
may
have
a
chance
to
begin
sure
at
least
of
a
support
while
waiting
for
promotion
our
plans
begin
but
do
not
end
here
as
men
of
distinction
who
have
won
the
highest
rank
in
their
callings
are
known
to
be
free
we
shall
invite
them
to
come
among
us
if
we
would
maintain
a
university
great
freedom
must
be
allowed
both
to
teachers
and
scholars
this
involves
freedom
of
methods
to
be
employed
by
the
instructors
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
freedom
of
courses
to
be
selected
by
the
students
but
this
freedom
is
based
on
laws
two
of
which
can
not
be
too
distinctly
or
too
often
enunciated
a
law
which
should
govern
the
admission
of
pupils
is
this
that
before
they
win
this
privilege
they
must
have
been
matured
by
the
long
preparatory
discipline
of
superior
teachers
and
by
the
systematic
laborious
and
persistent
pursuit
of
fundamental
knowledge
and
a
second
law
which
should
govern
the
work
of
professors
is
this
that
with
unselfish
devotion
to
the
discovery
and
advancement
of
truth
and
righteousness
they
renounce
all
other
preferment
so
that
like
the
greatest
of
all
teachers
they
may
promote
the
good
of
mankind
i
see
no
advantage
in
our
attempting
to
maintain
the
traditional
of
the
american
colleges
it
has
never
existed
in
the
university
of
virginia
it
is
modified
though
not
nominally
given
up
at
harvard
it
is
not
an
important
characteristic
of
michigan
and
cornell
it
is
not
known
in
the
english
french
or
german
universities
it
is
a
collegiate
rather
than
a
university
method
if
parents
or
students
desire
us
to
mark
out
prescribed
courses
either
classical
or
scientific
lasting
four
years
it
will
be
easy
to
do
so
but
i
apprehend
that
many
students
will
come
to
us
excellent
in
some
branches
of
a
liberal
education
and
deficient
in
others
good
perhaps
in
greek
latin
and
mathematics
deficient
in
chemistry
physics
zoology
history
political
economy
and
other
progressive
sciences
i
would
give
to
such
candidates
on
examination
credit
for
their
attainments
and
assign
them
in
each
study
the
place
for
which
they
are
fitted
a
proficient
in
plato
may
be
a
tyro
in
euclid
moreover
i
would
make
attainments
rather
than
time
the
condition
of
promotion
and
i
would
encourage
every
scholar
to
go
forward
rapidly
or
go
forward
slowly
according
to
the
fleetness
of
his
foot
and
his
freedom
from
impediment
in
other
words
i
would
have
our
university
seek
the
good
of
individuals
rather
than
of
classes
the
sphere
of
a
university
is
sometimes
restricted
by
its
walls
or
is
limited
to
those
who
are
enrolled
on
its
lists
there
are
three
particulars
in
which
we
shall
aim
at
extramural
influence
first
as
an
examining
body
ready
to
examine
and
confer
degrees
or
other
academic
honors
on
those
who
are
trained
elsewhere
next
as
a
teaching
body
by
opening
to
educated
persons
whether
enrolled
as
students
or
not
such
lectures
as
they
may
wish
to
attend
under
certain
restrictions
on
the
plan
of
the
lectures
in
the
high
seminaries
of
paris
and
finally
as
in
some
degree
at
least
a
publishing
body
by
encouraging
professors
and
lecturers
to
give
to
the
world
in
print
the
results
of
their
researches
what
are
we
aiming
at
an
enduring
foundation
a
slow
development
first
local
then
regional
then
national
influence
the
most
liberal
promotion
of
all
useful
knowledge
the
special
provision
of
such
departments
as
are
elsewhere
neglected
in
the
country
a
generous
affiliation
with
all
other
institutions
avoiding
interferences
and
engaging
in
no
rivalry
the
encouragement
of
research
the
promotion
of
young
men
and
the
advancement
of
individual
scholars
who
by
their
excellence
will
advance
the
sciences
they
pursue
and
the
society
where
they
dwell
no
words
could
indicate
our
aim
more
fitly
than
those
by
which
john
henry
newman
expresses
his
idea
of
the
university
in
a
page
glowing
with
enthusiasm
to
which
i
delight
to
revert
what
will
be
our
agencies
a
large
staff
of
teachers
abundance
of
instruments
apparatus
diagrams
books
and
other
means
of
research
and
instruction
good
laboratories
with
all
the
requisite
facilities
accessory
influences
coming
both
from
baltimore
and
washington
funds
so
unrestricted
charter
so
free
schemes
so
elastic
that
as
the
world
goes
forward
our
plans
will
be
adjusted
to
its
new
requirements
what
will
be
our
methods
liberal
advanced
instruction
for
those
who
want
it
distinctive
honors
for
those
who
win
them
appointed
courses
for
those
who
need
them
special
courses
for
those
who
can
take
no
other
a
combination
of
lectures
recitations
laboratory
practice
field
work
and
private
instruction
the
largest
discretion
allowed
to
the
faculty
consistent
with
the
purposes
in
view
and
finally
an
appeal
to
the
community
to
increase
our
means
to
strengthen
our
hands
to
supplement
our
deficiencies
and
especially
to
surround
our
scholars
with
those
social
domestic
and
religious
influences
which
a
corporation
can
at
best
imperfectly
provide
but
which
may
be
abundantly
enjoyed
in
the
homes
the
churches
and
the
private
associations
of
an
enlightened
christian
city
of
baltimore
and
this
great
undertaking
does
not
rest
upon
the
trustees
alone
the
whole
community
has
a
share
in
it
however
strong
our
purposes
they
will
be
modified
inevitably
by
the
opinions
of
enlightened
men
so
let
parents
and
teachers
incite
the
youth
of
this
commonwealth
to
high
aspirations
let
wise
and
judicious
counsellors
continue
their
helpful
suggestions
sure
of
being
heard
with
grateful
consideration
let
skilful
writers
avoiding
captionsness
on
the
one
hand
and
compliment
on
the
other
uphold
or
refute
or
amend
the
tenets
here
announced
let
the
guardians
of
the
press
diffuse
widely
a
knowledge
of
the
benefits
which
are
here
provided
let
men
of
means
largely
increase
the
usefulness
of
this
work
by
their
timely
gifts
at
the
moment
there
is
nothing
which
seems
to
me
so
important
in
this
region
and
indeed
in
the
entire
land
as
the
promotion
of
good
secondary
schools
preparatory
to
the
universities
there
are
old
foundations
in
maryland
which
require
to
be
made
strong
and
there
is
room
for
newer
enterprises
of
various
forms
every
large
town
should
have
an
efficient
academy
or
high
school
and
men
of
wealth
can
do
no
greater
service
to
the
public
than
by
liberally
encouraging
in
their
various
places
of
abode
the
advanced
instruction
of
the
young
none
can
estimate
too
highly
the
good
which
came
to
england
from
the
endowment
of
lawrence
sheriff
at
rugby
and
of
queen
elizabeth
school
at
westminster
or
the
value
to
new
england
of
the
phillips
foundations
in
exeter
and
and
over
every
contribution
made
by
others
to
this
new
university
will
enable
the
trustees
to
administer
with
greater
liberality
their
present
funds
special
foundations
may
be
affiliated
with
our
trust
for
the
encouragement
of
particular
branches
of
knowledge
for
the
reward
of
merit
for
the
construction
of
buildings
and
each
gift
like
the
new
recruits
of
an
army
will
be
more
efficient
because
of
the
place
it
takes
in
an
organized
and
efficient
company
it
is
a
great
satisfaction
in
this
world
of
changes
and
pecuniary
loss
to
remember
what
safe
investments
have
been
made
at
harvard
and
yale
and
other
old
colleges
where
dollar
for
dollar
is
still
shown
for
every
gift
the
atmosphere
of
maryland
seems
favorable
to
such
deeds
of
piety
hospitality
and
to
men
george
calvert
the
first
lord
baltimore
comes
here
returns
to
england
and
draws
up
a
charter
which
becomes
memorable
in
the
annals
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
for
which
he
deserves
to
be
ranked
as
bancroft
says
among
the
most
wise
and
benevolent
lawgivers
of
all
ages
among
the
liberals
of
none
was
bolder
than
charles
carroll
of

john
eager
howard
the
hero
of

almost
equally
worthy
of
gratitude
for
the
liberality
of
his
public

john

which
gives

a
noble
rank

while

lays
a
foundation
for
learning
and

which
we
celebrate
the
closing
sentences
of
the
discourse
were
addressed
to
the
young
men
of
baltimore
and
to
the
trustees
the
faculty
one
of
the
earliest
duties
which
devolved
upon
the
president
and
trustees
after
deciding
upon
the
general
scope
of
the
university
was
to
select
a
staff
of
teachers
by
whose
assistance
and
counsel
the
details
of
the
plan
should
be
worked
out
it
would
hardly
be
right
in
this
place
to
recall
the
distinctive
merits
of
the
able
and
learned
scholars
who
have
formed
the
academic
staff
during
the
first
fourteen
years
but
perhaps
the
writer
may
be
allowed
to
pay
in
passing
a
tribute
of
gratitude
and
respect
to
those
who
entered
the
service
of
the
university
at
its
beginning
to
their
suggestions
their
enthusiasm
their
learning
and
above
all
their
freedom
from
selfish
aims
and
from
petty
jealousies
must
be
attributed
in
a
great
degree
the
early
distinction
of
this
institution
they
came
from
widely
distant
places
they
had
been
trained
by
widely
different
methods
they
had
widely
different
intellectual
aptitudes
but
their
diversities
were
unified
by
their
devotion
to
the
university
in
which
they
were
enlisted
and
by
their
desire
to
promote
its
excellence
this
spirit
has
continued
till
the
present
time
and
has
descended
to
those
who
have
from
time
to
time
joined
the
ranks
so
that
it
may
be
emphatically
said
that
the
union
of
the
faculty
has
been
the
key
to
its
influence
the
first
requisite
of
success
in
any
institution
is
a
staff
of
eminent
teachers
each
of
whom
gives
freely
the
best
of
which
he
is
capable
the
best
varies
with
the
individual
one
may
be
an
admirable
lecturer
or
teacher
another
a
profound
thinker
a
third
a
keen
investigator
another
a
skilful
experimenter
the
next
a
man
of
great
acquisitions
one
may
excel
by
his
industry
another
by
his
enthusiasm
another
by
his
learning
another
by
his
genius
but
every
member
of
a
faculty
should
be
distinguished
by
some
uncommon
attainments
and
by
some
special
aptitudes
while
the
faculty
as
a
whole
should
be
united
and
cooperative
each
professor
according
to
his
subject
and
his
talents
should
have
his
own
best
mode
of
working
adjusted
to
and
controlled
by
the
exigencies
of
the
institution
with
which
he
is
associated

william

henry

kelly
william
halsted
in
selecting
a
staff
of
teachers
the
trustees
have
endeavored
to
consider
especially
the
devotion
of
the
candidate
to
some
particular
line
of
study
and
the
certainty
of
his
eminence
in
that
specialty
the
power
to
pursue
independent
and
original
investigation
and
to
inspire
the
young
with
enthusiasm
for
study
and
research
the
willingness
to
coöperate
in
building
up
a
new
institution
and
the
freedom
from
tendencies
toward
ecclesiastical
or
sectional
controversies
they
announced
that
they
would
not
be
governed
by
denominational
or
geographical
considerations
in
the
appointment
of
any
teacher
but
would
endeavor
to
select
the
best
person
whose
services
they
could
secure
in
the
position
to
be
filled
irrespective
of
the
place
where
he
was
born
or
the
college
in
which
he
was
trained
or
the
religious
body
with
which
he
might
be
enrolled
it
is
obvious
that
in
addition
to
the
qualifications
above
mentioned
regard
has
always
been
paid
to
those
personal
characteristics
which
can
not
be
rigorously
defined
but
which
can
not
be
overlooked
if
the
ethical
as
well
as
the
intellectual
character
of
a
professorial
station
is
considered
and
if
the
social
relations
of
a
teacher
to
his
colleagues
his
pupils
and
their
friends
are
to
be
harmoniously
maintained
the
professor
in
a
university
teaches
as
much
by
his
example
as
by
his
precepts
besides
the
resident
professors
it
has
been
the
policy
of
the
university
to
enlist
from
time
to
time
the
services
of
distinguished
scholars
as
lecturers
on
those
subjects
to
which
their
studies
have
been
particularly
directed
during
the
first
few
years
the
number
of
such
lecturers
was
larger
and
the
duration
of
their
visits
was
longer
than
it
has
been
recently
when
the
faculty
was
small
the
need
of
the
occasional
lecturer
was
more
apparent
for
obvious
reasons
than
it
has
been
in
later
days
still
the
university
continues
to
invite
the
cooperation
of
professors
and
the
proximity
of
baltimore
to
washington
makes
it
particularly
easy
to
engage
learned
gentlemen
from
the
capital
to
give
occasional
lectures
upon
their
favorite
studies
recently
a
lectureship
of
poetry
has
been
founded
by
and
turnbull
of
baltimore
in
memory
of
a
son
who
is
no
longer
living
and
an
annual
course
may
be
expected
from
writers
of
distinction
who
are
known
either
as
poets
or
as
critics
or
as
historians
of
poetry
the
first
lecturer
on
this
foundation
will
be
stedman
of
new
york
the
second
professor
jebb
of
cambridge
another
lectureship
has
been
instituted
by
eugene

with
the
object
of
promoting
the
purposes
of
the
young
men

association
the

a

distinction
between
collegiate
and
university
courses
from
the
opening
of
the
university
until
now
a
sharp
distinction
has
been
made
between
the
methods
of
university
instruction
and
those
of
collegiate
instruction
in
the
third
annual
report
september
the
views
which
had
been
announced
at
the
opening
of
the
university
are
expanded
and
are
illustrated
by
the
action
of
the
trustees
and
the
faculty
during
the
first
two
years
the
terms
university
and
college
have
been
so
frequently
interchanged
in
this
country
that
their
significance
is
liable
to
be
confounded
and
it
may
be
worth
while
once
more
at
least
to
call
attention
to
the
distinction
which
is
recognized
among
us
by
the
college
is
understood
a
place
for
the
orderly
training
of
youth
in
those
elements
of
learning
which
should
underlie
all
liberal
and
professional
culture
the
ordinary
conclusion
of
a
college
course
is
the
bachelor
degree
usually
but
not
necessarily
the
college
provides
for
the
ecclesiastical
and
religious
as
well
as
the
intellectual
training
of
its
scholars
its
scheme
admits
but
little
choice
frequent
daily
drill
in
languages
mathematics
and
science
with
compulsory
attendance
and
frequent
formal
examinations
is
the
discipline
to
which
each
student
is
submitted
this
work
is
simple
methodical
and
comparatively
inexpensive
it
is
understood
and
appreciated
in
every
part
of
this
country
in
the
university
more
advanced
and
special
instruction
is
given
to
those
who
have
already
received
a
college
training
or
its
equivalent
and
who
now
desire
to
concentrate
their
attention
upon
special
departments
of
learning
and
research
libraries
laboratories
and
apparatus
require
to
be
liberally
provided
and
maintained
the
holders
of
professorial
chairs
must
be
expected
and
encouraged
to
advance
by
positive
researches
the
sciences
to
which
they
are
devoted
and
arrangements
must
be
made
in
some
way
to
publish
and
bring
before
the
criticism
of
the
world
the
results
of
such
investigations
primarily
instruction
is
the
duty
of
the
professor
in
a
university
as
it
is
in
a
college
but
university
students
should
be
so
mature
and
so
well
trained
as
to
exact
from
their
teachers
the
most
advanced
instruction
and
even
to
quicken
and
inspire
by
their
appreciative
responses
the
new
investigations
which
their
professors
undertake
such
work
is
costly
and
complex
it
varies
with
time
place
and
teacher
it
is
always
somewhat
remote
from
popular
sympathy
and
liable
to
be
depreciated
by
the
ignorant
and
thoughtless
but
it
is
by
the
influence
of
universities
with
their
comprehensive
libraries
their
costly
instruments
their
stimulating
associations
and
helpful
criticisms
and
especially
their
great
professors
indifferent
to
popular
applause
superior
to
authoritative
dicta
devoted
to
the
discovery
and
revelation
of
truth
that
knowledge
has
been
promoted
and
society
released
from
the
fetters
of
superstition
and
the
trammels
of
ignorance

academic
degree
and
who
have
here
engaged
in
advanced
studies
those
who
have
entered
as
candidates
for

bachelors
degree
and
those
who
have
pursued
special
courses
without
reference
to
degrees
the
whole
number
of
persons
enrolled
in
these
three
classes
during
the
first
fourteen
years
is
fifteen
hundred
and
seven
hundred
and
three
persons
have
pursued
undergraduate
courses
and
nine
hundred
and

have
followed

many
of
those
who
entered
as
undergraduates
have
continued
as
graduates
and
have
proceeded
to
the
degree
of
doctor
of
philosophy
these
students
have
come
from
nearly
every
state
in
the
union
and
not
a
few
of
them
have
come
from
foreign
lands
many
of
those
who
received
degrees
before
coming
here
were
graduates
of
the
principal
institutions
of
this
country
the
degree
of
doctor
of

has
been
awarded
after
three
years
or
more
of
graduate
studies
to
one
hundred
and
persons
and

of

at
the
end
of
their
collegiate
course
two
degrees
and
two
only
have
been
opened
to
the
students
of
this
university
believing
that
the
manifold
forms
in
which
the
baccalaurate
degree
is
conferred
are
confusing
the
public
and
that
they
tend
to
lessen
the
respect
for
academic
titles
the
authorities
of
the
johns
hopkins
university
determined
to
bestow
upon
all
those
who
complete
their
collegiate
courses
the
title
of
bachelor
of
arts
this
degree
is
intended
to
indicate
that
its
possessor
has
received
a
liberal
education
or
in
other
words
that
he
has
completed
a
prolonged
and
systematic
course
of
studies
in
which
languages
mathematics
sciences
history
and
philosophy
have
been
included
the
amount
of
time
devoted
to
each
of
these
various
subjects
varies
according
to
individual
needs
and
preference
but
all
the
combinations
are
supposed
to
be
equally
difficult
and
honorable
seven
such
combinations
or
groups
of
studies
have
been
definitely
arranged
and
the
group
system
thus
introduced
combines
many
of
the
advantages
of
the
elective
system
with
many
of
the
advantages
of
a
fixed
curriculum
the
undergraduate
has
his
choice
among
many
different
lines
of
study
but
having
made
this
determination
he
is
expected
to
follow
the
sequence
prescribed
for
him
by
his
teachers
he
may
follow
the
old
classical
course
or
he
may
give
decided
preference
to
mathematics
and
physics
or
he
may
select
a
group
of
studies
antecedent
to
the
studies
of
a
medical
school
or
he
may
pursue
a
scientific
course
in
which
chemistry
predominates
or
he
may
lay
a
foundation
for
the
profession
of
law
by
the
study
of
history
and
political
science
or
he
may
give
to
modern
languages
the
preference
accorded
in
the
first
group
to
the
ancient
classics
in
making
his
selection
and
indeed
in
prosecuting
the
career
of
an
undergraduate
he
has
the
counsel
of
some
member
of
the
faculty
who
is
called
his
adviser
while
each
course
has
its
predominant
studies
each
comprises
in
addition
the
study
of
french
and
german
and
at
least
one
branch
of
science
usually
chemistry
or
physics
with
laboratory
exercises
the
degree
of
doctor
of
philosophy
is
offered
to
those
who
continue
their
studies
in
a
university
for
three
years
or
more
after
having
attained
the
baccalaureate
degree
their
attention
must
be
given
to
studies
which
are
included
in
the
faculty
of
philosophy
and
the
liberal
arts
and
not
to
the
professional
faculties
of
law
medicine
and
theology
students
who
have
graduated
in
other
institutions
of
repute
may
offer
themselves
as
candidates
for
this
degree
in
addition
to
the
requirements
above
mentioned
the
student
must
show
his
proficiency
in
one
principal
subject
and
in
two
that
are
secondary
and
must
submit
himself
to
rigid
examinations
first
written
and
then
oral
he
must
also
present
a
thesis
which
must
gain
the
approval
of
the
special
committee
to
which
it
may
be
referred
and
must
subsequently
be
printed
all
these
requisitions
are
enforced
by
a
faculty
which
is
known
as
the
board
of
university
studies
as
an
encouragement
to
the
systematic
prosecution
of
university
studies
the
degree
of
doctor
of
philosophy
in
this
university
is
offered
under
the
following
conditions
a
board
of
university
studies
is
constituted
for
the
purpose
of
guiding
the
work
of
those
who
may
become
candidates
for
this
degree
the
time
of
study
is
a
period
of
at
least
three
years
of
distinctive
university
work
in
the
philosophical
faculty
it
is
desirable
that
the
student
accepted
as
a
candidate
should
reside
here

before
he
is
graduated
in
definite
courses
of
study
at
this

before
he
can

he
must
satisfy
the

that

education
that

knowledge
of
french

he

name
his
principal

the

reserves
the
right
to
say
in

case
whether
the
antecedent
training
has
been
satisfactory
and
if
any
of
the
years

whether
they
may
be
regarded
as
spent

study
pursued

to
university

in
the
conditions
which
are

below
it
will
appear
that
there
are
several
tests
of
the
proficiency
of
the
candidate
in
addition
to
the
constant
observation
of
his
instructors
a
carefully
prepared
thesis
must
be
presented
by
the
candidate
on
a
subject
approved
by
his
chief
adviser
and
this
thesis
must
receive
the
approbation
of
the
board
there
are
private
examinations
of
the
candidate
both
in
his
chief
subject
and
in
the
subordinate
subjects
if
these
tests
are
successfully
passed
there
is
a
final
oral
examination
in
the
presence
of
the

an
indication
of

by
richard

cambridge
university
i
am
requested
to
furnish
information
with
reference
to
the
university
extension
movement
in
england
it
will
be
desirable
that
side
by
side
with
the
facts
i
should
put
the
ideas
of
the
movement
for
in
matters
like
these
the
ideas
are
the
inspiration
of
the
work
the
ideas
moreover
are
the
same
for
all
whereas
the
detailed
methods
must
vary
with
different
localities
the
idea
of
the
movement
is
its
soul
the
practical
working
is
no
more
than
the
body
but
body
and
soul
alike
are
subject
to
growth
and
so
it
has
been
in
the
present
case
the
english
university
extension
movement
was
in
no
sense
a
carefully
planned
scheme
put
forward
as
a
feat
of
institutional
symmetry
it
was
the
product
of
a
simple
purpose
pursued
through
many
years
amid
varying
external
conditions
in
which
each
modification
was
suggested
by
circumstances
and
tested
by
experience
and
with
the
complexity
of
our
operations
our
animating
ideas
have
been
striking
deeper
and
growing
bolder
speaking
then
up
to
date
i
would
define
the
root
idea
of
extension
in
the
following
simple
formula
university
education
for
the
whole
nation
organized
on
a
basis
of
itinerant
teachers
but
every
clause
in
this
defining
formula
will
need
explanation
and
defence
the
term
extension
has
no
doubt
grown
up
from
the
circumstance
that
the
movement
in
england
was
started
and
directed
by
the
universities
which
have
controlled
its
operations
by
precisely
the
same
machinery
by
which
they
manage
every
other
department
of
university
business
i
do
not
know
that
this
is
an
essential
feature
of
the
movement
the
london
branch
presents
an
example
of
a
flourishing
organization
directed
by
a
committee
formed
for
the
purpose
though
this
committee
at
present
acts
in
concert
with
three
universities
i
can
conceive
the
new
type
of
education
managed
apart
from
any
university
superintendence
only
i
should
look
upon
such
severance
as
a
far
more
serious
evil
for
the
universities
than
for
the
popular
movement
but
i
use
the
term
education
for
the
further
purpose
of
defining
the
type
of
instruction
offered
it
is
thus
distinguished
from
school
education
being
moulded
to
meet
the
wants
of
adults
it
is
distinguished
from
the
technical
training
necessary
for
the
higher
handicrafts
or
for
the
learned
professions
it
is
no
doubt
to
the
busy
classes
that
the
movement
addresses
itself
but
we
make
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
our
education
will
not
help
them
in
their
business
except
that
the
mind
not
being
built
in
compartments
it
is
impossible
to
stimulate
one
set
of
faculties
without
the
stimulus
reacting
upon
all
the
rest
the
education
that
is
properly
associated
with
universities
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
leading
up
to
anything
beyond
but
is
an
end
in
itself
and
applies
to
life
as
a
whole
and
the
foundation
for
university
extension
is
a
change
subtle
but
clear
that
may
be
seen
to
be
coming
over
the
attitude
of
the
public
mind
to
higher
education
varying
in
intensity
in
different
localities
but
capable
of
being
encouraged
where
it
is
least
perceptible
a
change
by
which
education
is
ceasing
to
be
regarded
as
a
thing
proper
to
particular
classes
of
society
or
particular
periods
of
life
and
is
coming
to
be
recognized
as
one
of
the
permanent
interests
of
life
side
by
side
with
such
universal
interests
as
religion
and
politics
for
persons
of
leisure
and
means
such
growing
demand
can
be
met
by
increased
activity
of
the
universities
university
extension
is
to
be
the
university
of
the
busy
my
definition
puts
the
hope
of
extending
university
education
in
this
sense
to
the
whole
nation
without
exception
i
am
aware
that
to
some
minds
such
indiscriminate
extension
will
seem
like
an
educational
communism
on
a
par
with
benevolent
schemes
for
redistributing
the
wealth
of
society
so
as
to
give
everybody
a
comfortable
income
all
round
but
it
surely
ought
not
to
be
necessary
to
explain
that
in
proposing
a
universal
system
of
education
we
are
not
meaning
that
what
each
individual
draws
from
the
system
will
be
the
same
in
all
cases
in
this
as
in
every
other
public
benefit
that
which
each
person
draws
from
it
must
depend
upon
that
which
he
brings
to
it
university
extension
may
be
conceived
as
a
stream
flowing
from
the
high
ground
of
universities
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
country
from
this
stream
each
individual
helps
himself
according
to
his
means
and
his
needs
one
takes
but
a
cupful
another
uses
a
bucket
a
third
claims
to
have
a
cistern
to
himself
every
one
suits
his
own
capacity
while
our
duty
is
to
see
that
the
stream
is
pure
and
that
it
is
kept
running
the
truth
is
that
the
purpose
of
university
extension
will
seem
visionary
or
practicable
according
to
the
conception
formed
of
education
as
to
what
in
education
is
essential
and
what
accidental
if
i
am
asked
whether
i
think
of
porters
miners
dock
or
agricultural
laborers
women
with
families
and
constant
home
duties
as
classes
of
people
who
can
be
turned
into
economists
physicists
literary
critics
art
connoisseurs
i
admit
that
i
have
no
such
idea
but
i
do
believe
or
rather
from
my
experience
in
england
i
know
that
all
such
classes
can
be
in
economic
scientific
literary
and
artistic
questions
and
i
say
boldly
that
to
interest
in
intellectual
pursuits
is
the
essential
of
education
in
comparison
with
which
all
other
educational
purposes
must
be
called
secondary
i
do
not
consider
that
a
child
has
been
taught
to
read
unless
he
has
been
made
to
like
reading
i
find
it
difficult
to
think
of
a
man
as
having
received
a
classical
education
if
the
man
however
scholarly
leaves
college
with
no
interest
in
classical
literature
such
as
will
lead
him
to
go
on
reading
for
himself
in
education
the
interest
is
the
life
if
a
system
of
instruction
gives
discipline
method
and
even
originating
power
without
rousing
a
lasting
love
for
the
subject
studied
the
whole
process
is
but
a
mental
galvanism
generating
a
delusive
activity
that
ceases
when
the
connection
between
instructor
and
pupil
is
broken
off
but
if
a
teacher
makes
it
his
first
business
to
stir
up
an
interest
in
the
matter
of
study
the
education
becomes
when
teacher
and
pupil
have
parted
and
the
subject
becomes
its
own
educator
if
then
it
be
conceded
that
the
essence
of
education
is
to
interest
does
it
not
seem
a
soberly
practical
purpose
that
we
should
open
up
to
the
whole
nation
without
exception
an
interest
in
intellectual
pursuits
i
take
my
stand
on
the
broad
moral
ground
that
every
human
being
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
has
two
sides
to
his
life
his
work
and
his
leisure
to
be
without
work
in
life
is
selfishness
and
sloth
but
if
a
man
or
woman
is
so
entangled
in
routine
duties
as
never
to
command
leisure
we
have
a
right
to
say
to
such
persons
that
they
are
leading
an
immoral
life
such
an
individual
has
no
claim
to
the
title
of
a
working
man
he
is
a
slave
it
may
be
cruel
circumstances
that
have
thus
absorbed
him
in
business
but
that
does
not
alter
the
fact
slavery
was
a
misfortune
rather
than
a
fault
to
those
who
suffered
it
but
in
any
case
to
be
content
with
slavery
is
a
crime
once
get
society
to
recognize
the
duty
of
leisure
and
there
is
immediately
a
scope
for
such
institutions
as
university
extension
that
exist
for
the
purpose
of
giving
intellectual
interests
for
such
leisure
time
the
movement
is
thus
one
of
the
greatest
movements
for
the
of
the
masses
with
a
large
section
of
the
people
there
is
at
the
present
moment
no
conception
of
in
life
except
that
of
rising
out
of
one
social
rank
into
another
this
last
is
of
course
a
perfectly
legitimate
ambition
but
it
is
outside
the
present
discussion
university
extension
knows
nothing
of
social
distinctions
it
has
to
do
with
a
far
more
important
mode
of
in
life
that
of
rising
in
the
rank
to
which
a
man
happens
to
belong
at
the
moment
whether
it
be
the
rank
in
which
he
started
or
any
other
there
is
a
saying
that
all
men
are
equal
after
dinner
and
it
is
true
that
while
in
the
material
wealth
we
seek
in
our
working
hours
equality
is
a
chimera
yet
in
the
intellectual
pursuits
that
belong
to
leisure
there
is
no
bar
to
the
equality
of
all
except
the
difference
of
individual
capacity
and
desire
macaulay
tells
of
the
dutch
farmers
who
worked
in
the
fields
all
day
and
at
night
read
the
georgics
in
the
original
scotch
and
american
universities
are
largely
attended
by
students
who
have
had
to
engage
in
menial
duties
all
the
summer
in
order
to
gain
funds
for
their
high
education
during
the
winter
and
every
university
extension
lecturer
highly
trained
specialist
as
he
is
will
testify
how
his
work
has
continually
brought
him
into
contact
with
persons
of
the
humblest
social
condition
whom
a
moment
conversation
has
made
him
recognize
as
his
intellectual
equals
no
one
has
any
difficulty
in
understanding
that
in
religious
intercourse
and
experience
all
classes
stand
upon
an
equality
and
i
have
spoken
of
the
foundation
for
the
university
extension
movement
as
being
the
growing
recognition
of
education
as
a
permanent
human
interest
akin
to
religion
the
experience
of
a
few
years
has
sufficiently
demonstrated
the
possibility
of
arousing
such
interest
to
make
it
universal
is
no
more
than
a
practical
question
of
time
money
and
methods
but
no
doubt
when
we
come
to
the
main
difficulty
of
the
movement
is
the
diversity
of
the
classes
it
seeks
to
approach
diversity
in
individual
capacity
in
leisure
means
and
previous
training
opposite
policies
have
been
urged
upon
us
some
have
said
whatever
you
do
you
must
never
lower
the
standard
let
the
extension
movement
present
outside
the
universities
precisely
the
same
education
as
the
universities
themselves
are
giving
however
long
you
may
have
to
wait
for
its
acceptance
on
the
other
hand
it
has
been
urged
you
must
go
first
where
you
are
most
needed
be
content
with
a
makeshift
education
until
the
people
are
ready
for
something
better
the
movement
has
accepted
neither
of
these
policies
but
has
made
a
distinction
between
two
elements
of
university
training
method
and
curriculum
so
far
as
method
is
concerned
we
have
considered
that
we
are
bound
to
be
not
less
thorough
but
more
thorough
if
possible
than
the
universities
themselves
in
proportion
as
our
clients
work
under
peculiar
difficulties
but
in
the
matter
of
curriculum
we
have
felt
it
our
first
duty
to
be
elastic
and
to
offer
little
or
much
as
may
in
each
case
be
desired
accordingly
we
have
elaborated
an
educational
unit
the
three
months
course
of
instruction
in
a
single
subject
this
unit
course
we
have
used
all
the
resources
we
could
command
for
making
as
thorough
in
method
as
possible
where
more
than
this
is
desired
we
arrange
that
more
in
a
combination
or
series
of
such
unit
courses
the
instruction
can
thus
be
taken
by
retail
or
wholesale
but
in
all
cases
it
must
be
administered
on
the
same
rigorous
method
the
key
to
the
whole
system
is
thus
the
unit
course
of
three
instruction
in
a
single
subject
the
method
of
such
a
course
is
conveyed
by
the
technical
terms
lecture
syllabus
exercises
class
the
lectures
are
addressed
to
audiences
as
miscellaneous
as
the
congregation
of
a
church
or
the
people
in
a
street
car
and
it
is
the
duty
of
the
teacher
to
attract
such
miscellaneous
audiences
as
well
as
to
hold
and
instruct
them
those
who
do
nothing
more
than
simply
attend
the
lectures
will
at
least
have
gained
the
education
of
continuous
interest
it
is
something
to
have
one
attention
kept
upon
the
same
subject
for
three
months
together
but
it
may
be
assumed
that
in
every
such
audience
there
will
be
a
nucleus
of
students
by
which
term
we
simply
mean
persons
willing
to
do
some
work
between
one
lecture
and
another
the
lectures
are
delivered
no
oftener
than
once
a
week
for
the
idea
is
not
that
the
lectures
convey
the
actual
instruction
great
part
of
which
is
better
obtained
from
books
but
the
office
of
the
lecture
is
to
throw
into
prominence
the
salient
points
of
the
study
and
rouse
the
hearers
to
read
for
themselves
the
course
of
instruction
is
laid
down
in
the
syllabus
a
document
of
perhaps
thirty
or
forty
pages
sold
for
a
trifling
sum
by
referring
for
details
to
the
pages
of
books
this
pamphlet
can
be
made
to
serve
as
a
for
the
whole
course
making
the
teacher
independent
in
his
order
of
exposition
of
any
other
the
syllabus
assists
the
general
audience
in
following
the
lectures
without
the
distraction
of
taking
notes
and
guides
the
reading
and
thinking
of
the
students
during
the
week
the
syllabus
contains
a
set
of
on
each
lecture
these
exercises
unlike
examination
questions
or
are
not
tests
of
memory
but
are
intended
to
train
the
student
to
work
for
himself
they
are
thus
to
be
done
under
the
freest
conditions
at
home
with
full
leisure
and
all
possible
access
to
books
notes
or
help
from
other
persons
the
written
answers
are
sent
to
the
lecturer
for
marginal
comment
and
returned
by
him
at
the
this
class
is
a
second
meeting
for
students
and
others
at
which
no
formal
lecture
is
given
but
there
is
free
talk
on
points
suggested
to
the
teacher
by
the
exercises
he
has
received
the
usual
experience
is
that
it
is
more
interesting
than
the
lecture
this
weekly
routine
of
lecture
exercise
and
class
goes
on
for
a
period
of
twelve
weeks
there
is
then
an
in
the
work
of
the
course
held
for
students
who
desire
to
take
it
certificates
are
given
by
the
university
but
it
is
an
important
arrangement
that
these
certificates
are
awarded
on
the
result
of
the
weekly
exercises
and
the
final
examination
the
subjects
treated
have
been
determined
by
the
demand
literature
stands
at
the
head
in
popularity
history
with
economy
is
but
little
behind
all
the
physical
sciences
have
been
freely
asked
for
art
constitutes
a
department
of
work
but
it
is
not
the
movement
has
no
function
to
train
artists
but
to
make
audiences
and
visitors
to
more
intelligent
it
will
be
observed
that
the
great
study
known
as
is
not
mentioned
in
this
list
but
it
is
an
instructive
fact
that
a
considerable
number
of
the
courses
in
literature
have
been
on
subjects
of
greek
and
latin
literature
treated
in
english
and
some
of
these
have
been
at
once
the
most
successful
in
numbers
and
the
most
technical
in
treatment
i
am
not
without
hope
that
our
english
university
extension
may
react
upon
our
english
universities
and
correct
the
vicious
conception
of
classical
studies
which
gives
to
the
great
mass
of
university
men
a
more
or
less
scholarly
hold
upon
ancient
languages
without
any
interest
whatever
in
ancient
literatures
this
university
extension
method
claims
to
be
an
advance
on
existing
systems
partly
because
under
no
circumstances
does
it
ever
give
lectures
unaccompanied
by
a
regular
plan
of
reading
and
exercises
for
students
these
exercises
moreover
are
designed
not
for
mental
drill
but
for
stimulus
to
original
work
the
association
of
students
with
a
general
audience
is
a
gain
to
both
parties
many
persons
follow
regularly
the
instruction
of
the
class
who
have
not
participated
in
the
exercises
moreover
the
students
by
their
connection
with
the
popular
audience
are
saved
from
the
academic
bias
which
is
the
besetting
sin
of
teachers
more
human
interest
is
drawn
into
the
study
the
same
effect
follows
from
the
miscellaneous
character
of
the
students
who
contribute
exercises
high
university
graduates
experts
in
special
pursuits
deeply
cultured
individuals
who
have
never
before
had
any
field
in
which
to
exhibit
the
fruits
of
their
culture
as
well
as
persons
whose
spelling
and
writing
would
pass
muster
nowhere
else
or
casual
visitors
from
the
world
of
business
or
young
men
and
women
fresh
from
school
or
even
children
writing
in
round
text
all
these
classes
may
be
represented
in
a
single
week
work
and
the
papers
sent
in
will
vary
in
elaborateness
from
a
scrawl
on
a
to
a
magazine
article
or
treatise
i
have
received
an
exercise
of
such
a
character
that
the
student
considerately
furnished
me
with
an
index
i
remember
one
longer
still
but
as
this
hailed
from
a
lunatic
asylum
i
will
quote
it
only
for
illustrating
the
diversity
of
the
spheres
reached
by
the
movement
study
participated
in
by
such
diverse
classes
can
not
but
have
an
which
is
to
teachers
and
students
one
of
the
main
attractions
of
the
movement
but
we
shall
be
expected
to
judge
our
system
by
results
and
so
far
as
the
unit
courses
are
concerned
we
have
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
very
few
persons
fail
in
our
final
examinations
and
yet
examiners
report
that
the
standard
in
university
extension
is
substantially
the
same
as
that
in
the
universities
our
pass
students
being
on
a
par
with
pass
men
in
the
universities
our
students
of
reaching
the
standard
of
honors
schools
personally
i
attach
high
importance
to
results
which
can
never
be
expressed
in
statistics
we
are
in
a
position
to
assert
that
a
successful
course
perceptibly
influences
the
of
a
locality
for
the
period
it
lasts
librarians
volunteer
reports
of
an
entirely
changed
demand
for
books
and
we
have
even
assurances
that
the
character
of
conversation
at
teas
has
undergone
marked
alteration
i
may
be
permitted
an
anecdote
illustrating
the
impression
made
upon
the
universities
themselves
i
once
heard
a
brilliant
university
lecturer
who
had
had
occasional
experience
of
extension
teaching
describe
a
course
of
investigation
which
had
interested
him
with
an
eye
to
business
i
asked
him
if
he
would
not
give
it
in
an
extension
course
he
became
grave
well
no
he
replied
i
have
not
thought
it
out
sufficiently
for
that
and
when
he
saw
my
look
of
surprise
he
added
you
know
anything
goes
down
in
college
but
when
i
have
to
face
your
mature
classes
i
must
know
my
ground
well
i
believe
the
impression
thus
suggested
is
not
uncommon
amongst
experts
who
really
know
the
movement
our
results
are
much
less
satisfactory
when
we
turn
to
the
other
side
of
our
system
and
enquire
as
to
curriculum
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
larger
part
of
our
local
centres
can
only
take
unit
courses
there
may
be
often
a
considerable
interval
between
one
course
and
another
or
where
courses
are
taken
regularly
the
necessity
of
meeting
popular
interest
involves
a
distracting
variety
of
subjects
while
an
appreciable
portion
of
our
energies
have
to
be
taken
up
with
preliminary
rather
intended
to
illustrate
the
working
of
the
movement
than
as
possessing
any
high
educational
value
the
most
important
advance
from
the
unit
course
is
the
affiliation
system
of
cambridge
university
by
this
a
town
that
becomes
regularly
affiliated
has
arranged
for
it
a
series
of
unit
courses
put
together
upon
proper
sequence
of
educational
topics
and
covering
some
three
or
four
years
students
satisfying
the
lecturers
and
examiners
in
this
extended
course
are
recognized
as
affiliated
and
can
at
any
time
enter
the
university
with
the
status
of
second
year
men
the
local
work
being
accepted
in
place
of
one
year
residence
and
study
apart
from
this
the
steps
in
our
educational
ladder
other
than
the
first
are
still
in
the
stage
of
prophecy
but
it
is
universally
recognized
that
this
drawback
is
a
matter
solely
of
funds
once
let
the
movement
command
endowment
and
the
localities
will
certainly
demand
the
wider
curriculum
that
the
universities
are
only
too
anxious
to
supply
the
third
point
in
our
definition
was
that
the
movement
was
to
be
organized
on
a
basis
of
itinerant
teachers
this
differentiates
university
extension
from
local
colleges
from
correspondence
teaching
and
from
the
systems
of
which
chautauqua
is
the
type
the
chief
function
of
a
university
is
to
teach
and
university
extension
must
stand
or
fall
with
its
teachers
it
may
or
may
not
be
desirable
on
other
grounds
to
multiply
universities
but
there
is
no
necessity
for
it
on
grounds
of
popular
education
the
itinerancy
being
a
sufficient
means
of
bringing
any
university
into
touch
with
the
people
as
a
whole
and
the
adoption
of
such
a
system
seems
to
be
a
natural
step
in
the
evolution
of
universities
in
the
middle
ages
the
whole
body
of
those
who
sought
a
liberal
education
were
to
be
found
crowded
into
the
limits
of
university
towns
where
alone
were
teachers
to
listen
to
and
manuscripts
to
copy
the
population
of
such
university
centres
then
numbered
hundreds
where
it
numbers
tens
the
first
university
extension
was
the
invention
of
printing
which
sent
the
books
itinerating
through
the
country
and
reduced
to
a
fraction
the
actual
attendance
at
the
university
while
it
vastly
increased
the
circle
of
the
educated
the
time
has
now
come
to
send
teachers
to
follow
the
books
the
ideas
of
the
university
being
circulated
through
the
country
as
a
whole
while
residence
at
a
university
is
reserved
as
the
apex
only
of
the
university
system
an
itinerancy
implies
central
and
local
management
and
travelling
lecturers
who
connect
the
two
the
central
management
is
a
university
or
its
equivalent
this
is
responsible
for
the
educational
side
of
the
movement
and
negotiates
for
the
supply
of
its
courses
of
instruction
at
a
fixed
price
per
course
the
local
management
may
be
in
the
hands
of
a
committee
formed
for
the
purpose
or
of
some
local
institution
such
as
a
scientific
or
literary
club
or
institute
which
may
care
to
connect
itself
with
the
universities
on
the
local
management
devolves
the
raising
funds
for
the
university
fee
and
for
local
expenses
as
well
as
the
duty
of
putting
the
advantages
of
the
course
offered
before
the
local
community
the
widest
diversity
of
practice
prevails
in
reference
to
modes
of
raising
funds
a
considerable
part
of
the
cost
will
be
met
by
the
tickets
of
those
attending
the
lectures
the
prices
of
which
i
have
known
to
vary
from
a
shilling
to
a
guinea
for
the
unit
course
while
admission
to
single
lectures
has
varied
from
a
penny
to
half
a
crown
but
all
experience
goes
to
show
that
only
a
part
of
this
cost
can
be
met
in
this
way
individual
courses
may
bring
in
a
handsome
profit
but
taking
account
over
various
terms
and
various
districts
we
find
that
not
more
than
of
the
total
cost
will
be
covered
by
ticket
money
and
even
this
is
estimated
on
the
assumption
that
no
more
than
the
unit
course
is
aimed
at
while
even
for
this
the
choice
of
subjects
and
the
chance
of
continuity
of
subject
from
term
to
term
are
seriously
limited
by
the
consideration
of
meeting
cost
as
far
as
possible
from
fees
university
extension
is
a
system
of
higher
education
and
higher
education
has
no
market
value
but
needs
the
help
of
endowment
but
the
present
age
is
no
way
behind
past
ages
in
the
number
of
generous
citizens
it
exhibits
as
ready
to
help
good
causes
the
millionaire
who
will
take
up
university
extension
will
leave
a
greater
mark
on
the
history
of
his
country
than
even
the
pious
founder
of
university
scholarships
and
chairs
and
even
if
individuals
fail
us
we
have
the
common
purse
of
the
public
or
the
nation
to
fall
back
upon
the
itinerant
lecturers
not
less
than
the
university
and
the
local
management
have
responsibility
for
the
progress
of
the
cause
an
extension
lecturer
must
be
something
more
than
a
good
teacher
something
more
even
than
an
attractive
lecturer
he
must
be
imbued
with
the
ideas
of
the
movement
and
ever
on
the
watch
for
opportunities
of
putting
them
forward
it
is
only
the
lecturer
who
can
maintain
in
audiences
the
feeling
that
they
are
not
simply
receiving
entertainment
or
instruction
which
they
have
paid
for
but
that
they
are
taking
part
in
a
public
work
and
are
responsible
for
giving
their
locality
a
worthy
place
in
a
national
scheme
of
university
education
the
lecturer
again
must
mediate
between
the
local
and
the
central
management
always
ready
to
assist
local
committees
with
suggestions
from
the
experience
of
other
places
and
equally
attentive
to
bringing
the
special
wants
of
different
centres
before
the
university
authorities
the
movement
is
essentially
a
teaching
movement
and
it
is
to
the
body
of
teachers
i
look
for
the
discovery
of
the
further
steps
in
the
development
of
popular
education
for
such
a
purpose
lecturers
and
directors
alike
must
be
imbued
with
the
missionary
spirit
for
university
extension
is
a
missionary
university
not
content
with
supplying
culture
but
seeking
to
stimulate
the
demand
for
it
this
is
just
the
point
in
which
education
in
the
past
has
shown
badly
in
comparison
with
religion
or
politics
when
a
man
is
touched
with
religious
ideas
he
seeks
to
make
converts
when
he
has
views
on
political
questions
he
agitates
to
make
his
views
prevail
culture
on
the
other
hand
has
been
only
too
often
cherished
as
a
badge
of
exclusiveness
instead
of
the
very
consciousness
of
superior
education
being
felt
as
a
responsibility
which
could
only
be
satisfied
by
efforts
to
educate
others
to
infuse
a
missionary
spirit
into
culture
is
not
the
least
purpose
of
university
extension
i
can
not
resist
the
temptation
to
carry
forward
this
thought
from
the
present
into
the
future
in
university
extension
so
described
may
we
not
see
a
germ
for
the
university
of
the
future
i
have
made
the
foundation
of
our
movement
the
growing
conception
of
education
as
a
permanent
interest
of
adult
life
side
by
side
with
religion
and
politics
the
change
is
at
best
only
beginning
it
tasks
the
imagination
to
conceive
all
it
will
imply
when
it
is
complete
to
me
it
appears
that
this
expanding
view
of
education
is
the
third
of
the
three
great
waves
of
change
the
succession
of
which
has
made
up
our
modern
history
there
was
a
time
when
religion
itself
was
identified
with
a
particular
class
the
clergy
alone
thinking
out
what
the
rest
of
the
nation
simply
accepted
then
came
the
series
of
revolutions
popularly
summed
up
as
the
reformation
by
which
the
whole
adult
nation
claimed
to
think
for
itself
in
matters
of
religion
and
the
special
profession
of
the
clergy
became
no
more
than
a
single
element
in
the
religious
life
of
the
nation
again
there
has
been
in
the
past
a
distinct
governing
class
to
which
the
rest
of
society
submitted
until
a
series
of
political
revolutions
lifted
the
whole
adult
population
into
using
the
services
of
political
experts
but
making
public
progress
the
interest
of
all
before
the
more
quiet
changes
of
the
present
age
the
conception
of
an
isolated
learned
class
is
giving
way
before
the
ideal
of
a
national
culture
in
which
universities
will
still
be
centres
for
educational
experts
while
university
extension
offers
liberal
education
to
all
until
educationally
the
whole
adult
population
will
be
just
as
much
within
the
university
as
politically
the
adult
population
is
within
the
constitution
it
would
appear
then
that
the
university
of
such
a
future
would
be
by
no
means
a
repetition
of
existing
types
such
as
oxford
or
cambridge
harvard
or
johns
hopkins
these
institutions
would
exist
and
be
more
flourishing
than
ever
but
they
would
all
be
merged
in
a
wider
of
england
or
of
america
and
just
as
the
state
means
the
whole
nation
acting
in
its
political
capacity
through
municipal
or
national
institutions
so
the
university
would
mean
the
whole
adult
nation
acting
in
its
educational
capacity
through
whatever
institutions
might
be
found
desirable
such
a
university
would
never
be
chartered
no
building
could
ever
house
it
no
royal
personage
or
president
of
the
united
states
would
ever
be
asked
to
inaugurate
it
the
very
attempt
to
found
it
would
imply
misconception
of
its
essential
character
it
would
be
no
more
than
a
floating
aggregation
of
voluntary
associations
like
the
companies
of
which
a
nation
commerce
is
made
up
such
associations
would
not
be
organized
but
would
simply
tend
to
coöperate
because
of
their
common
object
each
association
would
have
its
local
and
its
central
side
formed
for
the
purpose
of
mediating
between
the
wants
of
a
locality
and
the
educational
supply
offered
by
universities
or
similar
central
institutions
no
doubt
such
a
scheme
is
widely
different
from
the
ideal
education
of
european
countries
so
highly
organized
from
above
that
the
minister
of
education
can
look
at
his
watch
and
know
at
any
moment
all
that
is
being
done
throughout
the
country
on
the
contrary
the
genius
of
the
race
leans
towards
it
has
been
the
mission
of
the
race
in
the
past
to
develop
in
religion
and
politics
it
remains
to
crown
this
work
with
the
application
of
the
voluntary
system
to
liberal
education
in
indulging
this
piece
of
speculation
i
have
had
a
practical
purpose
before
me
if
what
i
have
described
be
a
reasonable
forecast
for
the
university
of
the
future
does
it
not
follow
that
university
extension
as
the
germ
of
it
presents
a
field
for
the
very
highest
academic
ambition
to
my
mind
it
appears
that
existing
types
of
university
have
reached
a
point
where
further
development
in
the
same
direction
would
mean
decline
in
english
universities
the
ideal
is
scholarship
is
a
good
thing
and
we
produce
it
but
the
system
which
turns
out
a
few
good
scholars
every
year
passes
over
the
heads
of
the
great
mass
of
university
students
without
having
awakened
them
to
any
intellectual
life
the
universities
are
producing
good
articles
but
with
a
terrible
waste
of
raw
material
the
other
main
type
of
university
enthrones
as
its
summum
bonum
possibly
research
is
as
good
a
purpose
as
a
man
can
set
before
him
but
it
is
not
the
sole
aim
in
life
and
when
one
contemplates
the
band
of
recruits
added
each
year
to
the
army
of
investigators
and
the
choice
of
ever
minuter
fields
not
to
say
lanes
and
alleys
of
research
one
is
led
to
doubt
whether
research
is
not
one
of
the
disintegrating
forces
of
society
and
whether
ever
increasing
specialisation
must
not
mean
a
perpetual
narrowing
of
human
sympathies
in
the
intellectual
leaders
of
mankind
both
types
of
university
appear
to
me
to
present
the
phenomena
of
a
country
suffering
from
the
effects
of
overproduction
where
the
energies
of
workers
had
been
concentrated
upon
adding
to
the
sum
of
wealth
and
all
too
little
attention
had
been
given
to
the
distribution
of
that
wealth
through
the
different
ranks
of
the
community
just
at
this
point
the
university
extension
movement
appears
to
recall
academic
energy
from
production
to
distribution
suggesting
that
devotion
to
physics
economics
art
can
be
just
as
truly
shown
by
raising
new
classes
of
the
people
to
an
interest
in
physical
and
economic
and
aesthetic
pursuits
as
by
adding
to
the
discoveries
of
science
or
increasing
the
mass
of
art
products
to
the
young
graduate
conscious
that
he
has
fairly
mastered
the
teaching
of
the
past
and
that
he
has
within
him
powers
to
make
advances
i
would
suggest
the
question
whether
even
for
the
highest
powers
there
is
any
worthier
field
than
to
work
through
university
extension
towards
the
university
of
the
future
