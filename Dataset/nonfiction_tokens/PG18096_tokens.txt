preface
this
is
the
first
attempt
to
write
the
history
of
smoking
in
this
country
from
the
social
point
of
view
there
have
been
many
books
written
about
tobacco
fairholt
history
of
tobacco
and
the
tobacco
of
andrew
steinmetz
are
still
valuable
authorities
but
hitherto
no
one
has
told
the
story
of
the
fluctuations
of
fashion
in
respect
of
the
practice
of
smoking
much
that
is
fully
and
well
treated
in
such
a
work
as
history
is
ignored
in
the
following
pages
i
have
tried
to
confine
myself
strictly
to
the
changes
in
the
attitude
of
society
towards
smoking
and
to
such
historical
and
social
sidelights
as
serve
to
illuminate
that
theme
the
was
popular
among
every
section
of
society
in
this
country
in
an
amazingly
short
space
of
time
after
smoking
was
first
practised
for
pleasure
and
retained
its
ascendancy
for
no
inconsiderable
period
signs
of
decline
are
to
be
observed
during
the
latter
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
in
the
course
of
its
successor
smoking
fell
more
and
more
under
the
ban
of
fashion
early
in
the
nineteenth
century
had
reached
its
nadir
from
the
social
point
of
view
then
came
the
introduction
of
the
cigar
and
the
revival
of
smoking
in
the
circles
from
which
it
had
long
been
almost
entirely
absent
the
practice
was
hedged
about
and
obstructed
by
a
host
of
restrictions
and
conventions
but
as
the
nineteenth
century
advanced
the
triumphant
progress
of
tobacco
became
more
and
more
marked
the
introduction
of
the
cigarette
completed
what
the
cigar
had
begun
barriers
and
prejudices
crumbled
and
disappeared
with
increasing
rapidity
until
at
the
present
day
in
england
by
pipe
or
cigar
or
cigarette
is
more
general
more
continuous
and
more
free
from
conventional
restrictions
than
at
any
period
since
the
early
days
of
its
triumph
in
the
first
decades
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
tracing
and
recording
of
this
social
history
of
the
touching
as
it
does
so
many
interesting
points
and
details
of
domestic
manners
and
customs
has
been
a
task
of
peculiar
pleasure
to
me
it
has
been
a
labour
of
love
but
no
one
can
be
more
conscious
of
the
many
imperfections
of
these

i

to

nicot
and
englishmen
to
raleigh
dean
hole
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
smoke
of
herbs
and
leaves
of
various
kinds
was
inhaled
in
this
country
and
in
europe
generally
long
before
tobacco
was
ever
heard
of
on
this
side
the
atlantic
but
whatever
smoking
of
this
kind
took
place
was
medicinal
and
not
social
many
instances
have
been
recorded
of
the
finding
of
pipes
resembling
those
used
for
in
elizabethan
times
in
positions
and
in
circumstances
which
would
seem
to
point
to
much
greater
antiquity
of
use
than
the
form
of
the
pipes
supports
but
some
at
least
of
these
finds
will
not
bear
the
interpretation
which
has
been
put
upon
them
and
in
other
cases
the
presence
of
pipes
could
reasonably
be
accounted
for
otherwise
than
by
associating
them
with
the
antiquity
claimed
for
them
in
any
case
the
entire
absence
of
any
allusions
whatever
to
smoking
in
any
shape
or
form
in
our
literature
or
in
mediæval
or
earlier
art
is
sufficient
proof
that
from
the
social
point
of
view
smoking
did
not
then
exist
the
inhaling
of
the
smoke
of
dried
herbs
for
medicinal
purposes
whether
through
a
funnel
or
otherwise
had
nothing
in
it
akin
to
the
smoking
of
tobacco
for
both
individual
and
social
pleasure
and
therefore
lies
outside
the
scope
of
this
book
it
may
further
be
added
that
though
the
use
of
tobacco
was
known
and
practised
on
the
continent
of
europe
for
some
time
before
smoking
became
common
in
england
it
was
taken
to
spain
from
mexico
by
a
physician
about
and
jean
nicot
about
the
same
time
sent
tobacco
seeds
to
france
yet
such
use
was
exclusively
for
medicinal
purposes
the
smoking
of
tobacco
in
england
seems
from
the
first
to
have
been
much
more
a
matter
of
pleasure
than
of
hygiene
who
first
smoked
a
pipe
of
tobacco
in
england
the
honour
is
divided
among
several
claimants
it
has
often
been
stated
that
captain
william
middleton
or
myddelton
son
of
richard
middleton
governor
of
denbigh
castle
a
captain
price
and
a
captain
koet
were
the
first
who
smoked
publicly
in
london
and
that
folk
flocked
from
all
parts
to
see
them
and
it
is
usually
added
that
pipes
were
not
then
invented
so
they
smoked
the
twisted
leaf
or
cigars
this
account
first
appeared
in
one
of
the
volumes
of
pennant
tour
in
wales
but
the
late
professor
arber
long
ago
pointed
out
that
the
remark
as
to
the
mode
of
smoking
by
cigars
and
not
by
pipes
was
simply
pennant
speculation
the
authority
for
the
rest
of
the
story
is
a
paper
in
the
sebright
which
in
an
account
of
william
middleton
has
the
remark
it
is
sayed
that
he
with
captain
thomas
price
of
plâsyollin
and
one
captain
koet
were
the
first
who
smoked
or
as
they
called
it
drank
tobacco
publickly
in
london
and
that
the
londoners
flocked
from
all
parts
to
see
them
no
date
is
named
and
no
further
particulars
are
available
another
elizabethan
who
is
often
said
to
have
smoked
the
first
pipe
in
england
is
ralph
lane
the
first
governor
of
virginia
who
came
home
with
drake
in
lane
is
said
to
have
given
sir
walter
raleigh
an
indian
pipe
and
to
have
shown
him
how
to
use
it
there
is
no
original
authority
however
for
the
statement
that
lane
first
smoked
tobacco
in
england
and
moreover
he
was
not
the
first
english
visitor
to
virginia
to
return
to
this
country
one
captain
philip
amadas
accompanied
captain
barlow
who
commanded
on
the
occasion
of
first
voyage
of
discovery
when
the
country
was
formally
taken
possession
of
and
named
virginia
in
honour
of
queen
elizabeth
this
was
early
in
the
two
captains
reached
england
in
september
bringing
with
them
the
natives
of
whom
king
james
i
in
his
to
tobacco
speaks
as
some
two
or
three
savage
men
who
were
brought
in
together
with
this
savage
custome
of
smoking
it
is
extremely
improbable
that
captains
amadas
and
barlow
when
reporting
to
raleigh
on
their
expedition
did
not
also
make
him
acquainted
with
the
indian
practice
of
smoking
this
would
be
two
years
before
the
return
of
ralph
lane
but
certainly
pipes
were
smoked
in
england
before
the
plant
was
introduced
into
europe
as
we
have
seen
about
and
it
was
under
cultivation
in
england
by
in
the
edition
of
chronicles
it
is
stated
that
tobacco
was
first
brought
and
made
known
by
sir
john
hawkins
about
the
year
but
not
used
by
englishmen
in
many
years
after
there
is
only
one
reference
to
tobacco
in
hawkins
description
of
his
travels
in
the
account
of
his
second
voyage
he
says
the
floridians
when
they
travel
have
a
kinde
of
herbe
dryed
which
with
a
cane
and
an
earthen
cup
in
the
end
with
fire
and
the
dried
herbs
put
together
do
smoke
thoro
the
cane
the
smoke
thereof
which
smoke
satisfieth
their
hunger
and
therewith
they
live
foure
or
five
days
without
meat
or
drinke
smoking
was
thus
certainly
known
to
hawkins
in
but
much
reliance
can
not
be
placed
on
the
statement
in
the
stow
of
that
he
first
made
known
the
practice
in
this
country
because
that
statement
appears
in
no
earlier
edition
of
the
chronicles
moreover
as
opposed
to
the
allegation
that
tobacco
was
not
used
by
englishmen
in
many
years
after
there
is
the
remark
by
william
harrison
in
his
chronologie
that
in
the
taking
in
of
the
smoke
of
the
indian
herbe
called
tobacco
by
an
instrument
formed
like
a
little
ladell
whereby
it
passeth
from
the
mouth
into
the
head
and
stomach
is
gretlie
taken
up
and
used
in
england
the
little
ladell
describes
the
early
form
of
the
with
small
and
very
shallow
bowl
king
james
in
his
reference
to
the
first
author
of
what
he
calls
this
abuse
clearly
had
sir
walter
raleigh
in
view
and
it
is
raleigh
with
whom
in
the
popular
mind
the
first
pipe
of
tobacco
smoked
in
england
is
usually
associated
the
tradition
is
crystallized
in
the
story
of
the
schoolboy
who
being
asked
what
do
you
know
about
sir
walter
raleigh
replied
sir
walter
raleigh
introduced
tobacco
into
england
and
when
smoking
it
in
this
country
said
to
his
servant
ridley
we
are
lighting
a
candle
in
england
which
by
god
blessing
will
never
be
put
out
the
truth
probably
is
that
whoever
actually
smoked
the
first
pipe
it
was
raleigh
who
brought
the
practice
into
common
use
it
is
highly
probable
also
that
raleigh
was
initiated
in
the
art
of
smoking
by
thomas
hariot
this
was
made
clear
i
think
by
the
late
brushfield
in
the
second
of
the
valuable
papers
on
matters
connected
with
the
life
and
achievements
of
sir
walter
which
he
contributed
under
the
title
of
raleghana
to
the
transactions
of
the
devonshire
association
hariot
was
sent
out
by
raleigh
for
the
specific
purpose
of
inquiring
into
and
reporting
upon
the
natural
productions
of
virginia
he
returned
in
and
in
published
the
results
of
his
researches
in
a
thin
quarto
with
an
extremely
title
beginning
a
briefe
and
true
report
of
the
new
found
land
of
virginia
and
continuing
for
a
further
words
in
this
report
hariot
says
of
the
tobacco
plant
there
is
an
herbe
which
is
sowed
a
part
by
itselfe
and
is
called
by
the
inhabitants
vppówoc
in
the
west
indies
it
hath
divers
names
according
to
the
severall
places
and
countries
where
it
groweth
and
is
used
the
spaniardes
generally
call
it
tobacco
the
leaves
thereof
being
dried
and
brought
into
powder
they
use
to
take
the
fume
or
smoke
thereof
by
sucking
it
through
pipes
made
of
claie
into
their
stomacke
and
heade
from
whence
it
purgeth
superfluous
fleame
and
other
grosse
humors
openeth
all
the
pores
and
passages
of
the
body
by
which
meanes
the
use
thereof
not
only
preserveth
the
body
from
obstructions
but
if
also
any
be
so
that
they
have
not
beane
of
too
long
continuance
in
short
time
breaketh
them
wherby
their
bodies
are
notably
preserved
in
health
and
know
not
many
greevous
diseases
wherewithall
wee
in
england
are
oftentimes
afflicted
so
far
hariot
report
regarded
tobacco
from
the
medicinal
point
of
view
only
but
it
is
important
to
note
that
he
goes
on
to
describe
his
personal
experience
of
the
practice
of
smoking
in
words
that
suggest
the
pleasurable
nature
of
the
experience
he
says
we
ourselves
during
the
time
we
were
there
used
to
suck
it
after
their
maner
as
also
since
our
returne
and
have
found
maine
manie
rare
and
wonderful
experiments
of
the
vertues
thereof
of
which
the
relation
woulde
require
a
volume
by
itselfe
the
use
of
it
by
so
manie
of
late
men
and
women
of
great
calling
as
else
and
some
learned
physitians
also
is
sufficient
witness
who
can
doubt
that
hariot
in
reporting
direct
to
sir
walter
raleigh
showed
his
employer
how
to
suck
it
after
their
maner
all
the
evidence
agrees
that
whoever
taught
raleigh
it
was
example
that
brought
smoking
into
notice
and
common
use
long
before
his
death
in
it
had
become
fashionable
as
we
shall
see
in
all
ranks
of
society
he
is
said
to
have
smoked
a
pipe
on
the
morning
of
his
execution
before
he
went
to
the
scaffold
a
tradition
which
is
quite
credible
every
one
knows
the
legend
of
the
water
or
beer
thrown
over
sir
walter
by
his
servant
when
he
first
saw
his
master
smoking
and
imagined
he
was
on
fire
the
story
was
first
associated
with
raleigh
by
a
writer
in
in
a
magazine
called
the
according
to
this
yarn
sir
walter
usually
indulged
himself
in
smoaking
secretly
two
pipes
a
day
at
which
time
he
order
a
simple
fellow
who
waited
to
bring
him
up
a
tankard
of
old
ale
and
nutmeg
always
laying
aside
the
pipe
when
he
heard
his
servant
coming
on
this
particular
occasion
however
the
pipe
was
not
laid
aside
in
time
and
the
simple
fellow
imagining
his
master
was
on
fire
as
he
saw
the
smoke
issuing
from
his
mouth
promptly
put
the
fire
out
by
sousing
him
with
the
contents
of
the
tankard
one
difficulty
about
this
story
is
the
alleged
secrecy
of
raleigh
indulgence
in
tobacco
there
seems
to
be
no
imaginable
reason
why
he
should
not
have
smoked
openly
later
versions
turn
the
ale
into
water
and
otherwise
vary
the
story
but
the
story
was
a
stock
jest
long
before
it
was
associated
with
raleigh
the
earliest
example
of
it
occurs
in
the
jests
attributed
to
richard
tarleton
the
famous
comic
performer
of
the
elizabethan
stage
who
died
in
the
year
of
the
armada
tarlton
jests
appeared
in
and
the
story
in
question
which
is
headed
how
tarlton
tooke
tobacco
at
the
first
comming
up
of
it
runs
as
follows
tarlton
as
other
gentlemen
used
at
the
first
comming
up
of
tobacco
did
take
it
more
for
fashion
sake
than
otherwise
and
being
in
a
roome
set
between
two
men
overcome
with
wine
and
they
never
seeing
the
like
wondered
at
it
and
seeing
the
vapour
come
out
of
nose
cryed
out
fire
fire
and
threw
a
cup
of
wine
in
face
make
no
more
stirre
quoth
tarlton
the
fire
is
quenched
if
the
sheriffes
come
it
will
turne
to
a
fine
as
the
custome
is
and
drinking
that
againe
fie
sayes
the
other
what
a
stinke
it
makes
i
am
almost
poysoned
if
it
offend
saies
tarlton
let
every
one
take
a
little
of
the
smell
and
so
the
savour
will
quickly
goe
but
tobacco
whiffes
made
them
leave
him
to
pay
all
in
the
early
days
of
smoking
the
smoker
was
very
generally
said
to
drink
tobacco
another
early
example
of
the
story
occurs
in
barnaby
rich
irish
hubbub
where
a
certain
welchman
coming
newly
to
london
and
for
the
first
time
seeing
a
man
smoking
extinguished
the
fire
with
a
bowle
of
beere
which
he
had
in
his
hand
various
places
are
traditionally
associated
with
raleigh
first
pipe
the
most
surprising
claim
perhaps
is
that
of
penzance
for
which
there
is
really
no
evidence
at
all
miss
courtney
writing
in
the
says
there
is
a
myth
that
sir
walter
raleigh
landed
at
penzance
quay
when
he
returned
from
virginia
and
on
it
smoked
the
first
tobacco
ever
seen
in
england
but
for
this
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
the

according
to
edward
hutton
in

in

sir
walter
raleigh
smoked
his

of

according

it
was
in
this
room
that
sir
walter
smoked
his
first
pipe
when
visiting
his
friend
the
owner
of
the
mansion

henry
long
another
tradition
gives
the
old
pied
bull
at
islington
long
since
demolished
as
the
scene
of
the
momentous
event
it
is
said
in
its
earlier
days
to
have
been
a
country
house
of
sir
walter
and
according
to
legend
it
was
in
his
in
this
house
that
he
had
his
first
pipe
hone
in
the
first
volume
of
the
every
day
book
tells
how
he
and
some
friends
visited
this
pied
bull
then
in
a
very
decayed
condition
and
smoked
their
pipes
in
the
in
memory
of
sir
walter
from
the
recently
published
biography
of
william
hone
by
hackwood
we
learn
that
the
jovial
party
consisted
of
william
hone
george
cruikshank
joseph
goodyear
and
david
sage
who
jointly
signed
a
humorous
memorandum
of
their
proceedings
on
the
occasion
from
which
it
appears
that
each
of
us
smoked
a
pipe
that
is
to
say
each
of
us
one
or
more
pipes
or
less
than
one
pipe
and
the
undersigned
george
cruikshank
having
smoked
pipes
innumerable
or
more
or
less
and
that
several
pots
of
porter
in
aid
of
the
said
smoking
were
consumed
followed
by
bowls
of
negus
made
from
port
wine
per
bottle
duty
knocked
off
lately
and
other
ingredients
speeches
were
made
and
toasts
proposed
and
altogether
the
four
who
desired
to
have
the
gratification
of
saying
hereafter
that
we
had
smoked
a
pipe
in
the
same
room
that
the
man
who
first
introduced
tobacco
smoked
in
himself
seem
to
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
themselves
wherever
raleigh
is
known
to
have
lived
or
lodged
we
are
sure
to
find
the
tradition
flourishing
that
there
he
smoked
his
first
pipe
the
assertion
has
been
made
of
his
birthplace
hayes
barton
although
it
is
very
doubtful
if
he
ever
visited
the
place
after
his
parents
left
it
some
years
before
their
son
had
become
acquainted
with
tobacco
and
also
with
more
plausibility
of
his
home
at
youghal
in
the
south
of
ireland
froude
in
one
of
his
short
studies
quotes
a
legend
to
the
effect
that
raleigh
smoked
on
a
rock
below
the
manor
house
of
greenaway
on
the
river
dart
which
was
the
home
of
the
first
husband
of
katherine
champernowne
afterwards
raleigh
wife
and
devonshire
have
adopted
the
story
perhaps
the
most
likely
scene
of
raleigh
first
experiments
in
the
art
of
smoking
was
durham
house
which
stood
where
the
adelphi
terrace
and
the
streets
between
it
and
the
strand
now
stand
this
was
in
the
occupation
of
sir
walter
for
twenty
years
and
he
was
probably
resident
there
when
hariot
returned
from
virginia
to
make
his
report
and
instruct
his
employer
in
the
management
of
a
pipe
walter
thornbury
in
his
haunted
london
referring
to
the
story
of
the
servant
throwing
the
ale
over
his
smoking
master
says
there
is
a
doubtful
old
legend
about
raleigh
first
pipe
the
scene
of
which
may
be
not
unfairly
laid
at
durham
house
where
raleigh
lived
the
ale
story
is
mythical
but
it
is
highly
probable
that
sir
walter
first
pipes
were
smoked
in
durham
house
brushfield
quotes
hepworth
dixon
in
her
majesty
tower
as
drawing
an
imaginary
and
yet
probable
picture
of
him
and
his
companions
at
a
window
of
this
very
house
overlooking
the
highway
requires
no
effort
of
the
fancy
to
picture
these
three
men
shakespeare
bacon
and
raleigh
as
lounging
in
a
window
of
durham
house
puffing
the
new
indian
weed
from
silver
bowls
discussing
the
highest
themes
in
poetry
and
science
while
gazing
on
the
and
the
river
the
darting
barges
of
dame
and
cavalier
and
the
distant
pavilions
of
paris
garden
and
the
globe
this
is
a
pure
effort
of
the
fancy
so
far
as
bacon
and
shakespeare
are
concerned
shakespeare
absolute
silence
about
tobacco
forbids
us
to
assume
that
he
smoked
but
of
raleigh
the
picture
may
be
true
enough
the
house
had
as
aubrey
tells
us
a
little
turret
that
looked
into
and
over
the
thames
and
had
the
prospect
which
is
as
pleasant
perhaps
as
any
in
the
world
and
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
the
owner
of
the
noble
house
did
not
often
smoke
a
contemplative
pipe
in
the
window
of
that
pleasant
turret
the
only
mention
made
of
tobacco
by
raleigh
himself
occurs
in
a
testamentary
note
made
a
little
while
before
his
execution
in
referring
to
the
tobacco
remaining
on
his
ship
after
his
last
voyage
he
wrote
sir
lewis
stukely
sold
all
the
tobacco
at
plimouth
of
which
for
the
most
part
of
it
i
gave
him
a
fift
part
of
it
as
also
a
role
for
my
lord
admirall
and
a
role
for
himself
i
desire
that
hee
may
give
his
account
for
the
tobacco
as
showing
how
closely
sir
walter
name
was
associated
with
it
long
after
his
death
brushfield
quotes
the
following
entry
from
the
diary
of
the
great
earl
of
cork
sent
by
travers
to
my
infirme
cozen
roger
vaghan
a
pott
of
sir
walter
raleighes
tobackoe
in
the
wallace
collection
at
hertford
house
is
a
pouch
or
case
labelled
as
having
belonged
to
and
been
used
by
sir
walter
raleigh
this
pouch
contains
several
clay
pipes
it
was
perhaps
this
same
pouch
or
case
which
once
upon
a
time
figured
in
ralph
thoresby
museum
at
leeds
and
is
described
by
thoresby
himself
in
his
ducatus
leodiensis
curiously
enough
a
few
years
ago
when
excavations
were
being
made
around
the
foundations
of
raleigh
house
at
youghal
a
clay
was
dug
up
which
in
size
shape
was
exactly
like
the
pipes
in
the
wallace
exhibit
raleigh
lived
and
no
doubt
smoked
in
the
youghal
house
so
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
bowl
found
belonged
to
one
of
the
pipes
actually
smoked
by
him
in
the
garden
of
the
youghal
house
by
the
way
they
used
to
show
the
tree
perhaps
still
do
so
under
which
raleigh
was
sitting
smoking
his
pipe
when
his
servant
drenched
him
thus
the
tradition
which
as
we
have
seen
dates
from
only
has
obtained
two
local
habitations
youghal
and
durham
house
on
the
adelphi
site
in
november
a
curiously
shaped
pipe
was
put
up
for
sale
in
stevens
auction
room
covent
garden
which
was
described
as
that
which
raleigh
smoked
on
the
scaffold
the
pipe
in
question
was
said
to
have
been
given
by
the
doomed
man
to
bishop
andrewes
in
whose
family
it
remained
for
many
years
and
it
was
stated
to
have
been
in
the
family
of
the
owner
who
sent
it
for
sale
for
some
years
the
pipe
was
of
wood
constructed
in
four
pieces
of
strange
shape
rudely
carved
with
dogs
heads
and
faces
of
red
indians
according
to
legend
it
had
been
presented
to
raleigh
by
the
indians
the
auctioneer
stevens
remarked
that
unfortunately
a
parchment
document
about
the
pipe
was
lost
some
years
ago
and
declared
if
we
could
only
produce
the
parchment
the
pipe
would
fetch
in
the
end
however
it
was
knocked
down
at
guineas
the
form
and
make
of
the
first
pipe
is
a
matter
i
do
not
propose
to
go
into
here
but
in
connexion
with
the
first
pipe
smoked
in
this
country
aubrey
interesting
statements
must
be
given
writing
in
the
time
of
charles
ii
he
said
that
he
had
heard
his
grandfather
say
that
at
first
one
pipe
was
handed
from
man
to
man
round
about
the
table
they
had
first
silver
pipes
the
ordinary
sort
made
use
of
a
walnut
shell
and
a
straw
surely
a
very
unsatisfactory
pipe
tobacco
in
those
earliest
days
he
says
was
sold
for
its
weight
in
silver
i
have
heard
some
of
our
old
yeomen
neighbours
say
that
when
they
went
to
malmesbury
or
chippenham
market
they
culled
out
their
biggest
shillings
to
lay
in
the
scales
against
the
tobacco
ii
tobacco
triumphant
smoking
fashionable
and
universal
tobacco
engages
both
sexes
all
ages
the
poor
as
well
as
the
wealthy
from
the
court
to
the
cottage
from
childhood
to
dotage
both
those
that
are
sick
and
the
healthy
this
chapter
and
the
next
deal
with
the
history
of
smoking
during
the
first
fifty
years
after
its
introduction
as
a
social
habit
roughly
to
the
use
of
tobacco
spread
with
extraordinary
rapidity
among
all
classes
of
society
during
the
latter
part
of
queen
elizabeth
reign
and
through
the
early
decades
of
the
seventeenth
century
were
in
full
blast
tobacco
was
triumphant
perhaps
the
most
noteworthy
thing
about
smoking
at
this
period
from
the
social
point
of
view
was
its
fashionableness
one
of
the
marked
characteristics
of
the
gallant
the
beau
or
dandy
or
swell
of
the
time
was
his
devotion
to
tobacco
earle
says
that
a
gallant
was
one
that
was
born
and
shaped
for
his
clothes
but
clothes
were
only
a
part
of
his
equipment
bishop
hall
satirizing
the
young
man
of
fashion
in
describes
the
delicacies
with
which
he
was
accustomed
to
indulge
his
appetite
and
adds
that
having
eaten
he
quaffs
a
whole
tunnel
of
tobacco
smoke
and
old
robert
burton

satirically
enumerating
the
accomplishments
of
a
complete
a
gentleman
names
to
take
tobacco
with
a
grace
with
hawking
riding
hunting
dicing
and
the
like
the
qualifications
for
a
gallant
were
described
by
another
writer
in
as
to
make
good
faces
to
take
tobacco
well
to
spit
well
to
laugh
like
a
waiting
gentlewoman
to
lie
well
to
blush
for
nothing
to
looke
big
upon
little
fellowes
to
scoffe
with
a
grace
and
for
a
neede
to
ride
prettie
and
well
a
curious
feature
of
among
fashionable
smokers
of
the
period
was
the
practice
of
passing
a
pipe
from
one
to
another
after
the
fashion
of
the
loving
cup
there
is
a
scene
in
greene
tu
quoque
laid
in
a
fashionable
ordinary
where
the
london
gallants
meet
as
usual
and
one
says
to
a
companion
who
is
smoking
please
you
to
impart
your
smoke
very
willingly
sir
says
the
smoker
number
two
takes
a
whiff
or
two
and
courteously
says
in
good
faith
a
pipe
of
excellent
vapour
the
owner
of
the
pipe
then
explains
that
it
is
the
best
the
house
yields
whereupon
the
other
immediately
depreciates
it
saying
affectedly
had
you
it
in
the
house
i
thought
it
had
been
your
own
is
not
so
good
now
as
i
took
it
for
another
writer
of
this
time
speaks
of
one
pipe
of
tobacco
sufficing
three
or
four
men
at
once
the
rich
young
gallant
carried
about
with
him
his
tobacco
apparatus
often
of
gold
or
silver
in
the
form
of
wherewith
to
lift
a
live
coal
to
light
his
pipe
ladle
for
the
cold
snuffe
into
the
nosthrill
and
sometimes
the
was
of
ivory
and
occasionally
a
gallant
would
have
set
in
his
box
so
that
when
he
took
it
out
to
obtain
tobacco
he
could
at
the
same
time
have
a
view
of
his
own
delectable
person
when
our
gallant
went
to
dine
at
the
ordinary
according
to
the
custom
of
the
time
he
brought
out
these
possessions
and
smoked
while
the
dinner
was
being
served
before
dinner
after
taking
a
few
turns
up
and
down
paul
walk
in
the
old
cathedral
he
might
look
into
the
booksellers
shops
and
pipe
in
mouth
inquire
for
the
most
recent
attack
upon
the
divine
weed
the
contemporary
tobacco
literature
was
abundant
or
drop
into
an
apothecary
which
was
usually
a
also
and
there
meet
his
in
the
afternoon
the
gallant
might
attend
what
dekker
calls
a
by
which
may
possibly
have
been
meant
a
or
more
probably
the
gathering
after
dinner
at
one
of
the
many
ordinaries
in
the
neighbourhood
of
paul
cathedral
of
tobacconists
as
smokers
were
then
called
to
discuss
the
merits
of
their
respective
pipes
and
of
the
various
kinds
of
tobacco
whether
your
cane
or
your
pudding
be
sweetest
of
course
he
often
bragged
like
julio
in
day
law
trickes
tobacco
the
best
in
europe
cost
me
ten
crownes
an
ounce
by
this
vapour
an
amusing
example
of
the
bragging
tobacconist
is
pictured
for
us
in
ben
jonson
bobadil
bobadil
may
perhaps
be
somewhat
of
an
exaggerated
caricature
but
it
is
probable
that
the
dramatist
in
drawing
him
simply
exaggerated
the
characteristic
traits
of
many
smokers
of
the
day
this
hero
drawing
tobacco
from
his
pocket
declares
that
it
is
all
that
is
left
of
seven
pounds
which
he
had
bought
only
yesterday
was
a
consumption
of
seven
pounds
of
tobacco
in
eight
days
is
a
pretty
tall
order
then
he
goes
on
to
brag
of
its
quality
your
right
trinidado
and
to
assert
that
he
had
been
in
the
indies
where
the
herb
grows
and
where
he
himself
and
a
dozen
other
gentlemen
had
for
the
space
of
weeks
known
no
other
nutriment
than
the
fume
of
tobacco
this
again
was
tolerably
steep
even
for
this
braggart
he
continues
with
more
bombast
in
praise
of
the
medicinal
virtues
of
the
herb
virtues
which
were
then
very
firmly
and
widely
believed
in
and
is
replied
to
by
cob
the
who
with
equal
exaggeration
on
the
other
side
denounces
tobacco
and
declares
that
four
people
had
died
in
one
house
from
the
use
of
it
in
the
preceding
week
and
that
one
had
voided
a
bushel
of
soot
the
properly
accomplished
gallant
not
only
professed
to
be
curiously
learned
in
pipes
and
tobacco
but
his
knowledge
of
prices
and
their
fluctuations
of
the
apothecaries
and
other
shops
where
the
herb
was
sold
and
of
the
latest
and
most
fashionable
ways
of
inhaling
and
exhaling
the
smoke
was
like
weller
knowledge
of
london
extensive
and
peculiar
it
was
knowledge
of
this
kind
that
gained
for
a
gallant
reputation
and
respect
by
no
means
to
be
acquired
by
mere
scholarship
and
learning
the
satirical
dekker
might
class
tobacconists
with
perfumers
young
country
gentlemen
and
fools
but
he
bears
invaluable
witness
to
the
devotion
of
the
fashionable
men
of
the
day
to
the
costlye
and
smoak
it
was
customary
for
a
man
to
carry
a
case
of
pipes
about
with
him
in
a
play
of
everie
woman
in
her
humour
there
is
an
inventory
of
the
contents
of
a
gentleman
pocket
with
a
value
given
for
each
item
which
displays
certainly
a
curious
assortment
of
articles
first
comes
a
brush
and
comb
worth
fivepence
and
next
a
worth
three
halfpence
with
these
aids
to
vanity

a

valued
at
fourpence
half
an
ounce
of

valued
at
sixpence
and
three
pence
in

or
as
it
is
quaintly
worded
in
money
and
golde
satirists
of
course
made
fun
of
the

pocketful
of

his

is
on

the
smoke
flyeth
so
fast
from
his
mouth
it
may
be
noted
by
the
way
that
the

no
hesitation
about
smoking
in
the

of

dekker
suggests
probably
with
truth
that
one
reason
why
the
young
gallant
liked
to
push
his
way
to
a
stool
on
the
stage
notwithstanding
the

and
hisses
of
the
opposed
rascality

must
have
been
the

produced
by

ben
jonson
has
given
us
an
amusing
picture
of
the
behaviour
of
gallants
on
the
elizabethan
stage
in
his
cynthia
revels
in
this
scene
a
child
thus
mimics
the
obtrusive
beau
now
sir
suppose
i
am
one
of
your
genteel
auditors
that
am
come
in
having
paid
my
money
at
the
door
with
much
ado
and
here
i
take
my
place
and
sit
downe
i
have
my
three
sorts
of
tobacco
in
my
pocket
my
light
by
me
and
thus
i
begin
this
light
i
wonder
that
any
man
is
so
mad
to
come
to
see
these
rascally
tits
play
here
they
do
act
like
so
many
wrens
not
the
fifth
part
of
a
good
face
amongst
them
all
and
then
their
musick
is
abominable
able
to
stretch
a
man
ears
worse
than
ten
pillories
and
their
ditties
most
lamentable
things
like
the
pitiful
fellows
that
make
them
poets
by
this
vapour
a
were
not
for
tobacco
i
think
the
very
smell
of
them
would
poison
me
i
should
not
dare
to
come
in
at
their
gates
a
man
were
better
visit
fifteen
jails
or
a
dozen
or
two
hospitals
than
once
adventure
to
come
near
them
and
the
young
rascal
who
at
each
pause
marked
by
a
dash
had
puffed
his
pipe
no
doubt
blowing
an
extra
large
cloud
when
he
swore
by
this
vapour
turns
to
his
companions
and
says
how
well
and
they
pronounce
his
mimicry
excellent
smoking
was
not
confined
to
the
auditors
on
the
stage
who
paid
sixpence
each
for
a
stool
there
was
the
lords
room
over
the
stage
which
seems
to
have
corresponded
with
the
modern
stage
boxes
the
price
of
admission
to
which
appears
to
have
been
a
shilling
where
the
pipe
was
also
in
full
blast
dekker
tells
how
a
gallant
at
a
new
play
would
take
a
place
in
the
twelve
penny
room
next
the
stage
because
the
lords
and
you
may
seem
to
be
hail
fellow
well
met
and
jonson
in
every
man
out
of
his
humour
speaks
of
one
who
pretended
familiarity
with
courtiers
that
he
talked
of
them
as
if
he
had
taken
tobacco
with
them
over
the
stage
in
the
lords
room
among
the
general
audience
of
the
theatre
smoking
seems
to
have
been
usual
also
the
among
those
present
few
of
whom
were
men
must
have
suffered
by
the
practice
in
that
admirable
burlesque
comedy
by
beaumont
and
fletcher
the
knight
of
the
burning
pestle
the
citizen
wife
addressing
herself
either
to
the
gallants
on
the
stage
or
to
her
sitting
around
her
exclaims
fy
this
stinking
tobacco
kills
men
would
there
were
none
in
england
now
i
pray
gentlemen
what
good
does
this
stinking
tobacco
do
you
nothing
i
warrant
you
make
chimneys
a
your
faces
but
many
women
viewed
tobacco
differently
as
we
shall
see
in
the
chapter
on
smoking
by
women
moreover
this
good
woman
herself
in
the
epilogue
to
the
burlesque
invites
the
gentlemen
whom
she
has
before
abused
for
smoking
to
come
to
her
house
where
she
will
entertain
them
with
a
pottle
of
wine
and
a
pipe
of
tobacco
hentzner
the
german
traveller
who
visited
london
in
speaks
of
smoking
being
customary
among
the
audience
at
plays
who
were
also
supplied
with
fruits
such
as
apples
pears
and
nuts
according
to
the
season
carried
about
to
be
sold
as
well
as
ale
and
wine
he
was
struck
with
the
universal
prevalence
of
the
not
only
at
plays
but
everywhere
else
he
says
the
english
are
constantly
smoking
tobacco
and
then
he
proceeds
to
describe
how
they
did
it
they
have
pipes
on
purpose
made
of
clay
into
the
further
end
of
which
they
put
the
herb
so
dry
that
it
may
be
rubbed
into
powder
and
putting
fire
to
it
they
draw
the
smoak
into
their
mouths
which
they
puff
out
again
through
their
nostrils
like
funnels
along
with
it
plenty
of
phlegm
and
defluxions
from
the
head
this
suggests
that
the
unpleasant
and
quite
unnecessary
habit
of
spitting
was
common
with
these
early
smokers
a
suggestion
which
is
amply
supported
by
other
contemporary
evidence
tobacco
was
smoked
by
all
classes
and
in
almost
all
places
it
was
smoked
freely
in
the
streets
in
some
verses
prefixed
to
an
edition
of
skelton
elinour
rumming
which
appeared
in
the
ghost
of
skelton
who
was
to
king
henry
viii
was
made
to
say
that
he
constantly
saw
smoking
i
walked
between
westminster
hall
and
the
church
of
saint
paul
and
so
thorow
the
citie
where
i
saw
and
did
pitty
my
country
men
cases
with
faces
sucking
and
drinking
a
filthie
weede
was
sometimes
curiously
combined
with
other
trades
a
fleet
street
tobacconist
of
this
time
was
also
a
dealer
in
worsted
stockings
a
mercer
of
mansfield
who
died
at
the
beginning
of
and
who
apparently
carried
on
business
also
at
southwell
had
a
considerable
stock
of
tobacco
in
the
inventory
of
all
his
cattalles
and
goods
which
is
dated
january
there
is
included
it
in
tobacco
nineteen
pounds
worth
of
tobacco
considering
the
then
value
of
money
was
no
small
stock
for
a
to
carry
but
the
apothecaries
were
the
most
usual
salesmen
and
their
shops
and
the
ordinaries
were
the
customary
day
for
the
more
fashionable
smokers
the
taverns
and
inns
however
were
also
filled
with
smoke
and
taverns
were
frequented
by
men
of
all
social
grades
dekker
speaks
of
the
gallant
leaving
the
tavern
at
night
when
the
spirit
of
wine
and
tobacco
walkes
in
his
train
on
the
occasion
of
the
accession
of
james
i
when
london
was
given
up
to
rejoicing
and
revelry
we
are
told
that
tobacconists
smokers
filled
up
whole
tavernes
king
james
himself
is
an
unwilling
witness
to
the
popularity
of
tobacco
he
tells
us
that
a
man
could
not
heartily
welcome
his
friend
without
at
once
proposing
a
smoke
it
had
become
he
says
a
point
of
and
he
that
would
refuse
to
take
a
pipe
among
his
fellows
was
accounted
peevish
and
no
good
company
yea
he
continues
with
rising
indignation
the
mistress
can
not
in
a
more
mannerly
kind
entertain
her
servant
than
by
giving
him
out
of
her
fair
hand
a
pipe
of
tobacco
smoking
was
soon
as
common
in
the
country
as
in
london
on
wednesday
april
in
the
course
of
a
debate
in
the
house
of
commons
sir
william
stroud
who
seems
to
have
been
a
worthy
disciple
of
that
king
james
i
moved
that
he
would
have
tobacco
banished
wholly
out
of
the
kingdom
and
that
it
may
not
be
brought
in
from
any
part
nor
used
amongst
us
and
sir
grey
palmes
said
that
if
tobacco
be
not
banished
it
will
overthrow
men
in
england
for
now
it
is
so
common
that
he
hath
seen
ploughmen
take
it
as
they
are
at
plough
perhaps
this
terrible
picture
of
a
ploughman
smoking
as
he
followed
his
lonely
furrow
did
not
impress
the
house
so
much
as
sir
grey
evidently
thought
it
would
at
all
events
tobacco
was
not
banished
peers
and
squires
and
parsons
and
peasants
alike
smoked
the
parson
of
thornton
in
buckinghamshire
was
so
devoted
to
tobacco
that
when
his
supply
of
the
weed
ran
short
he
is
said
to
have
cut
up
the
and
smoked
them
this
is
dated
about
in
the
description
of
the
famous
country
squire
hastings
who
was
remarkable
for
keeping
up
old
customs
in
the
early
years
of
the
seventeenth
century
we
read
of
how
his
hall
tables
were
littered
with
hawks
hoods
bells
old
hats
with
their
crowns
thrust
in
full
of
pheasants
eggs
tables
dice
cards
and
store
of
sir
francis
vere
in
the
account
of
his
services
by
sea
and
land
which
he
wrote
about
mentions
that
on
an
expedition
to
the
azores
in
the
earl
of
essex
waiting
for
news
of
the
enemy
at
michael
called
for
tobacco
and
so
on
horseback
with
those
noblemen
and
gentlemen
on
foot
beside
him
took
tobacco
whilst
i
was
telling
his
lordship
of
the
men
i
had
sent
forth
and
orders
i
had
given
presently
came
the
sound
of
guns
which
made
his
lordship
cast
his
pipe
from
him
and
listen
to
the
shooting
another
famous
nobleman
lord
herbert
of
cherbury
herbert
on
whose
every
part
truth
might
spend
all
her
voice
fame
all
her
art
was
a
smoker
as
we
know
from
a
very
curious
passage
in
his
autobiography
he
appears
to
have
smoked
not
so
much
for
pleasure
as
for
supposed
reasons
of
health
it
is
well
known
he
wrote
to
those
that
wait
in
my
chamber
that
the
shirts
waistcoats
and
other
garments
i
wear
next
my
body
are
sweet
beyond
what
either
can
easily
be
believed
or
hath
been
observed
in
any
else
which
sweetness
also
was
found
to
be
in
my
breath
above
others
before
i
used
to
take
tobacco
which
towards
my
latter
time
i
was
forced
to
take
against
certain
rheums
and
catarrhs
that
trouble
me
which
yet
did
not
taint
my
breath
for
any
long
time
the
autobiography
was
written
about
so
as
lord
herbert
did
not
smoke
till
towards
the
latter
part
of
his
life
he
died
in
he
clearly
was
not
one
of
those
who
took
to
tobacco
in
the
first
enthusiasm
for
the
new
indulgence
when
robert
earl
of
essex
and
henry
earl
of
southampton
were
tried
for
high
treason
in
westminster
hall
on
february
the
members
of
the
house
of
lords
who
with
the
judges
formed
the
court
if
we
may
believe
the
french
ambassador
of
the
time
behaved
in
a
remarkable
and
unseemly
manner
in
a
letter
to
monsieur
de
rohan
the
ambassador
declared
that
while
the
earls
and
the
counsel
were
pleading
their
lordships
guzzled
and
smoked
and
that
when
they
gave
their
votes
condemning
the
two
earls
they
were
stupid
with
eating
and
yvres
de
tabac
drunk
with
smoking
this
was
probably
quite
untrue
as
a
representation
of
what
actually
took
place
but
it
would
hardly
have
been
written
had
smoking
not
been
a
common
practice
among
noble
lords
queen
elizabeth
secretary
of

sir
robert

to

a
curious
scene
took
place
at
oxford
in
when
king
james
visited
the
university
two
subjects
were
debated
by
learned
dons
before
his
majesty
and
one
of
them
at
his
own
suggestion
was
whether
the
frequent
use
of
tobacco
is
good
for
healthy
men
among
those
who
spoke
were
doctors
ailworth
gwyn
gifford
and
cheynell
the
discussion
needless
to
say
being
conducted
in
the
presence
of
the
author
of
the
counterblaste
to
tobacco
was
not
favourable
to
the
herb
the
king
summed
up
in
a
speech
which
hopelessly
begged
the
question
while
it
contained
plenty
of
strong
denunciation
after
his
majesty
had
spoken
one
learned
doctor
cheynell
who
is
described
by
the
recorder
isaac
wake
the
public
orator
of
the
university
as
second
to
none
of
the
doctors
had
the
courage
to
rise
and
with
a
pipe
held
forth
in
his
hand
to
speak
both
wittily
and
eloquently
in
favour
of
tobacco
from
the
medicinal
point
of
view
praising
it
to
the
skies
says
wake
as
of
virtue
beyond
all
other
remedial
agents
his
wit
pleased
both
the
king
and
the
whole
assembly
whom
it
moved
to
laughter
but
when
he
had
finished
his
majesty
made
a
lengthy
rejoinder
in
which
he
said
some
curious
things
he
objected
to
the
medicinal
use
of
tobacco
and
quite
agreed
with
previous
speakers
that
such
a
use
must
have
arisen
among
barbarians
and
indians
who
he
went
on
to
say
had
as
much
knowledge
of
medicine
as
they
had
of
civilized
customs
if
he
argued
there
were
men
whose
bodies
were
benefited
by
this
did
not
so
much
redound
to
the
credit
of
tobacco
as
it
did
reflect
upon
the
depraved
condition
of
such
men
that
their
bodies
should
have
sunk
to
the
level
of
those
of
barbarians
so
as
to
be
affected
by
remedies
such
as
were
effective
on
the
bodies
of
barbarians
and
indians
his
majesty
kindly
suggested
that
doctors
who
believed
in
tobacco
as
a
remedial
agent
should
take
themselves
and
their
medicine

pollution

it
would
seem
that
the

not

the

sometimes

thus

distinguished
from
other

in
the

of

probably
of
late

the

she
bestows
upon

miss

one
with
the
satisfaction
caused
by
a
thing
that
is
exactly
right
and
with
admiration
for
the
art
and
skill
of
a
true
artist
these

indeed
for

a
digression
however
which
has
carried
us
far
away
from
the
early
years
of
the
seventeenth
century
it
is
pretty
clear
that
not
a
few
of
the

were
great
rascals

let
us
into
some
of

of
adulteration
the
treatment
of

the

the

in

the
leaves

and
of

have
often
been
used
as
a
substitute
for
tobacco
in
modern
days
a
correspondent
of
and
in
said
that
when
he
was
a
boy
he
knew
an
old
calvinist
minister
who
used
to
smoke
a
dried
mixture
of
the
leaves
of
horehound
yarrow
and
foot
intermingled
with
a
small
quantity
of
tobacco
he
said
it
was
a
very
good
substitute
for
the
genuine
article
similar
mixtures
or
the
leaves
of
coltsfoot
alone
have
often
been
smoked
in
bygone
days
by
folk
who
could
not
afford
to
smoke
tobacco
only
the
number
of
shops
where
tobacco
was
sold
in
the
early
days
of
its
triumph
seems
to
have
been
extraordinary
barnaby
rich
one
of
the
most
prolific
parents
of
pamphlets
in
an
age
of
prolific
writers
wrote
a
satire
on
the
honestie
of
this
age
which
was
printed
in
in
this
production
rich
declares
that
every
fellow
who
came
into
an
and
called
for
his
pot
must
have
his
pipe
also
for
tobacco
was
then
a
commodity
as
much
sold
in
every
tavern
inn
and
as
wine
ale
or
beer
he
goes
on
to
say
that
shops
grocers
shops
and
chandlers
shops
were
almost
never
without
company
who
from
morning
to
night
were
still
taking
tobacco
and
what
a
number
there
are
besides
he
adds
that
doe
keepe
houses
set
open
shoppes
that
have
no
other
trade
to
live
by
but
by
the
selling
of
tobacco
rich
says
he
had
been
told
that
a
list
had
been
recently
made
of
all
the
houses
that
traded
in
tobacco
in
and
near
about
london
and
that
if
a
man
might
believe
what
was
confidently
reported
there
were
found
to
be
upwards
of
houses
that
lived
by
that
trade
but
he
could
not
say
whether
the
apothecaries
and
chandlers
shops
where
tobacco
was
also
sold
were
included
in
that
number
he
proceeds
to
calculate
what
the
annual
expenditure
on
smoke
must
be
the
number
of
seems
very
large
and
is
perhaps
exaggerated
round
numbers
are
apt
to
be
over
rather
than
under
the
mark
another
proof
of
the
extraordinary
popularity
of
the
new
habit
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
by
the
seventeenth
year
of
the
reign
of
james
i
the
of
tobacco
that
is
by
the
society
of
had
become
so
very
numerous
and
considerable
a
body
that
they
were
incorporated
by
royal
charter
and
bore
on
their
shield
a
tobacco
plant
in
full
blossom
the
society
motto
was
happily
chosen
let
brotherly
love
continue
a
further
witness
to
the
prevalence
of
smoking
and
to
the
enormous
number
of
shops
is
camden
the
antiquary
in
his
annales
he
remarks
with
curious
detail
that
since
its
introduction
that
indian
plant
called
tobacco
or
nicotiana
is
growne
so
frequent
in
use
and
of
such
price
that
many
nay
the
most
part
with
an
insatiable
desire
doe
take
of
it
drawing
into
their
mouth
the
smoke
thereof
which
is
of
a
strong
scent
through
a
pipe
made
of
earth
and
venting
of
it
againe
through
their
nose
some
for
wantownesse
or
rather
fashion
sake
and
other
for
health
sake
insomuch
that
tobacco
shops
are
set
up
in
greater
number
than
either
alehouses
or
tavernes
one
result
of
the
herb
popularity
was
found
in
frequent
attempts
by
tradesmen
of
various
kinds
to
sell
it
without
being
duly
licensed
to
do
so
bell
in
his
valuable
book
on
fleet
street
in
seven
centuries
mentions
the
arrest
of
a
fleet
street
grocer
by
the
star
chamber
for
unlicensed
trading
in
tobacco
he
also
quotes
from
the
dunstan
wardmote
register
of
several
cases
of
complaint
against
unlicensed
traders
and
others
four
men
were
presented
for
selling
ale
and
tobacco
unlicensed
and
for
annoying
the
judges
of
serjeants
inn
whose
chambers
are
near
adjoyning
two
other
men
one
of
them
hailing
from
the
notorious
ram
alley
were
presented
for
annoying
the
judges
at
serjeants
inn
with
the
stench
and
smell
of
their
tobacco
which
looks
as
if
the
judges
were
of
king
james

about
smoking

of

for
keeping

the
great
disturbance
of
all
the
inhabitants
and
neighbours
near
adjoining

notorious
in
sundry
ways

mentions
that
in

against
timothy

and
john
barker
of

for
keeping
their
open
all
night
and
fyers
in
the
same
without
any
chimney
and
suffering
hot
waters
spirits
and
selling
also
without
licence
to
the
great
disquietness
and
annoyance
of
that
neighbourhood
there
were
sad
goings
on
of
many
kinds
in
ram
alley
it
is
uncertain
when
licences
were
first
issued
for
the
sale
of
tobacco
probably
they
were
issued
in
london
some
time
before
it
was
considered
necessary
to
license
dealers
in
other
parts
of
the
country
among
the

of

that
it

hancock
says
in
his
book
on
that
old
town
a
mercer
and
a
hosier
were
selected
it
would
seem
from
one
example
i
have
noted
as
if
in
some
places
smoking
were
not
allowed
in
in
the
of
stephen
church
and
parish
norwich
the
income
for

on
one
occasion
received
by
way
of
fine
from
one
edmond
nockals
for
selling
a
pot
of
beer
wanting
in
measure
contrary
to
the
law
and
another
sovereign
from
william
howlyns
for
a
like
offence
this
is
right
and
intelligible
enough
but
on
another
occasion
in
the
same
year
each
of
these
men
who
presumably
were
keepers
had
to
pay
a
substantial
sum
considering
the
then
value
of
money
for
the
same
offence
and
for
suffering
parishioners
to
smoke
in
his
house
i
have
been
unable
to
obtain
any
information
as
to
why
a
publican
should
have
been
fined
an
additional
for
the
heinous
offence
of
allowing
a
brother
parishioner
to
smoke
in
his
house
penalties
for
offences
of
this
fanciful
kind
were
not
common
in
england
but
in
puritan
new
england
they
were
abundant
in
the
early
days
of
the
american
colonies
the
use
of
the
creature
called
tobacko
was
by
no
means
encouraged
in
connecticut
a
man
was
permitted
by
the
law
to
smoke
once
if
he
went
on
a
journey
of
ten
miles
but
not
more
than
once
a
day
and
by
no
means
in
another
man
house
it
could
hardly
have
been
difficult
to
evade
so
absurd
a
regulation
as
this
it
has
been
already
stated
that
the
elizabethan
gallant
was
acquainted
with
the
most
fashionable
methods
of
inhaling
and
exhaling
the
smoke
of
tobacco
a
singular
feature
of
the
enthusiasm
for
tobacco
in
the
early
years
of
the
seventeenth
century
was
the
existence
of
professors
of
the
art
of
smoking
some
of
the
apothecaries
whose
shops
were
in
most
repute
for
the
quality
of
the
tobacco
kept
took
pupils
and
taught
them
the
slights
as
tricks
with
the
pipe
were
called
these
included
exhaling
the
smoke
in
little
globes
rings
and
so
forth
the
invaluable
ben
jonson
in
the
preliminary
account
of
the
characters
in
his
every
man
out
of
his
humour
describes
one
sogliardo
as
an
essential
clown
yet
so
enamoured
of
the
name
of
a
gentleman
that
he
will
have
it
though
he
buys
it
he
comes
up
every
term
to
learn
to
take
tobacco
and
see
new
motions
sogliardo
was
accustomed
to
hire
a
private
room
to
practise
in
the
fashionable
way
was
to
expel
the
smoke
through
the
nose
in
a
play
by
field
of
a
foolish
nobleman
is
asked
by
some
boon
companions
in
a
tavern
will
your
lordship
take
any
tobacco
when
another
sneers
he
can
not
put
it
through
his
nose
his
lordship
was
apparently
not
well
versed
in
the
slights
taking
tobacco
was
clearly
an
accomplishment
to
be
studied
seriously
shift
a
professor
of
the
art
in
jonson
play
puts
up
a
bill
in
paul
the
recognized
centre
for
advertisements
and
commercial
business
of
every
kind
in
which
he
offers
to
teach
any
young
gentleman
newly
come
into
his
inheritance
who
wishes
to
be
as
exactly
qualified
as
the
best
of
the
gallants
are
to
entertain
the
most
gentlemanlike
use
of
tobacco
as
first
to
give
it
the
most
exquisite
perfume
then
to
know
all
the
delicate
sweet
forms
for
the
assumption
of
it
as
also
the
rare
corollary
and
practice
of
the
cuban
ebolition
euripus
and
whiff
which
he
shall
receive
or
take
in
here
at
london
and
evaporate
at
uxbridge
or
farther
if
it
please
him
taking
the
whiff
it
has
been
suggested
may
have
been
either
a
swallowing
of
the
smoke
or
a
retaining
it
in
the
throat
for
a
given
space
of
time
but
what
may
be
meant
by
the
cuban
ebolition
or
the
euripus
is
perhaps
best
left
to
the
imagination
ebolition
is
simply
a
variant
of
ebullition
and
ebullition
as
applied
with
burlesque
intent
to
rapid
smoking
the
vapour
bubbling
rapidly
from
the
is
intelligible
enough
but
why
cuban
euripus
was
the
name
in
ancient
geography
of
the
channel
between
eubœa
negropont
and
the
mainland
a
passage
which
was
celebrated
for
the
violence
and
uncertainty
of
its
currents
and
hence
the
name
was
occasionally
applied
by
our
older
writers
to
any
strait
or
having
like
characteristics
the
use
of
the
word
in
connexion
with
tobacco
may
like
that
of
ebolition
have
some
reference
to
furious
smoking
but
the
meaning
is
not
clear
if
one
contemporary
writer
may
be
believed
some
of
these
early
smokers
acquired
the
art
of
emitting
the
smoke
through
their
ears
but
a
healthy
scepticism
is
permissible
here
the
accomplished
shift
promises
a
pupil
in
the
art
of
taking
tobacco
that
if
he
pleases
to
be
a
practitioner
he
shall
learn
in
a
fortnight
to
take
it
plausibly
in
any
ordinary
theatre
or
the
tiltyard
if
need
be
in
the
most
popular
assembly
that
is
the
tiltyard
adjoined
whitehall
palace
and
was
the
frequent
scene
of
sports
in
which
queen
elizabeth
took
the
greatest
delight
here
took
place
not
only
tilting
properly
so
called
but
performances
and
dancing
and
other
diversions
which
her
majesty
held
in
high
favour
consequently
the
tiltyard
was
constantly
the
scene
of
courtly
gatherings
and
if
smoking
were
permitted
on
such
occasions
as
shift
boasting
promises
would
appear
to
indicate
then
it
may
be
reasonably
inferred
that
queen
elizabeth
did
not
entertain
the
objections
to
the
new
practice
that
her
successor
king
james
set
forth
with
such
vehemence
in
his
famous
counterblaste
to
tobacco
there
is
however
no
positive
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
to
show
what
the
attitude
of
the
virgin
queen
towards
tobacco
really
was
a
tradition
as
to
her
smoking
herself
on
one
occasion
is
referred
to
in
a
subsequent
chapter
that
on
smoking
by
women
although
tobacco
was
in
such
general
use
it
yet
had
plenty
of
enemies
it
was
extravagantly
abused
and
extravagantly
praised
robert
burton
of
anatomy
of
melancholy
fame
like
many
other
writers
of
his
time
was
prepared
to
admit
the
medicinal
value
of
the
herb
though
he
detested
the
general
habit
of
smoking
tobacco
was
supposed
in
those
days
to
be
good
for
a
surprising
variety
of
ailments
and
diseases
but
to
explore
that
little
section
of
popular
medicine
would
be
foreign
to
my
purpose
burton
believed
in
tobacco
as
medicine
but
with
regard
to
habitual
smoking
he
was
a
worthy
follower
of
king
james
the
strength
of
whose
language
he
sought
to
emulate
and
exceed
when
he
denounced
the
common
taking
of
tobacco
by
most
men
which
take
it
as
tinkers
do
ale
as
a
plague
a
mischief
a
violent
purger
of
goods
lands
health
hellish
devilish
and
damned
tobacco
the
ruin
and
overthrow
of
body
and
soul
no
could
wish
for
a
more
denunciation
than
that
thomas
dekker
to
whose
pictures
of
london
social
life
at
the
opening
of
the
seventeenth
century
we
are
so
much
indebted
for
information
both
with
regard
to
smoking
and
in
respect
of
many
other
matters
of
interest
was
himself
an
enemy
of
tobacco
he
politely
refers
to
that
great
tobacconist
the
prince
of
smoake
and
darkness
don
pluto
and
in
another
place
addresses
tobacco
as
thou
beggarly
monarche
of
indians
and
setter
up
of
and
proceeds
in
a
like
strain
of
abuse
one
of
the
most
curious
of
the
early
publications
on
tobacco
in
which
an
attempt
is
made
to
hold
the
balance
fairly
between
the
legitimate
use
and
the
licentious
abuse
of
the
herb
is
tobias
venner
tract
with
the
title
a
brief
and
accurate
treatise
concerning
the
taking
of
the
fume
of
tobacco
which
very
many
in
these
dayes
doe
too
licenciously
use
in
which
the
immoderate
irregular
and
unseasonable
use
thereof
is
reprehended
and
the
true
nature
and
best
manner
of
using
it
perspicuously
demonstrated
venner
described
himself
as
a
doctor
of
physic
in
bath
and
his
tract
was
published
in
london
in
venner
says
that
tobacco
is
of
ineffable
force
for
the
rapid
healing
of
wounds
cuts
sores
and
so
on
by
external
application
but
thinks
little
of
its
use
for
any
other
purpose
like
others
of
his
school
he
attacks
the
licentious
tobacconists
smokers
who
spend
and
consume
not
only
their
time
but
also
their
health
wealth
and
witts
in
taking
of
this
loathsome
and
unsavorie
fume
he
admits
the
popularity
of
the
herb
but
expresses
his
own
personal
objection
to
the
detestable
savour
or
smack
that
it
leaveth
behind
upon
the
taking
of
it
from
which
one
is
inclined
to
surmise
that
the
doctor
first
pipe
was
not
an
entire
success
with
an
evident
desire
to
be
fair
venner
notwithstanding
his
dislike
of
the
savour
refuses
to
condemn
tobacco
utterly
because
of
what
he
considers
its
valuable
medicinal
qualities
and
he
goes
so
far
as
to
give
precepts
in
the
use
of
tobacco
the
sixth
is
that
you
drink
not
between
the
taking
of
the
fumes
as
our
idle
and
smoakie
tobacconists
are
wont
there
must
be
no
alliance
in
short
between
the
pipe
and
the
cheerful
glass
the
tenth
and
last
precept
is
that
you
goe
not
abroad
into
the
aire
presently
immediately
upon
the
taking
of
the
fume
but
rather
refrain
therefrom
the
space
of
halfe
an
houre
or
more
especially
if
the
season
be
cold
or
moist
the
suggestion
that
the
smoker
when
he
has
finished
his
pipe
shall
wait
for
half
an
hour
or
so
before
he
ventures
into
the
outer
air
is
very
quaint
venner
goes
on
to
give
a
terrible
catalogue
of
the
ills
that
will
befall
the
smoker
who
uses
tobacco
contrary
to
the
order
and
way
i
have
set
down
it
is
a
dreadful
list
which
may
possibly
have
frightened
a
few
nervous
smokers
but
probably
it
had
no
greater
effect
than
the
terrible
curse
in
the
jackdaw
of
rheims
another
tract
which
may
be
classed
with
venner
treatise
was
the
nepenthes
or
the
vertues
of
tobacco
by
william
barclay
which
was
published
at
edinburgh
in
this
is
sometimes
referred
to
and
quoted
as
by
fairholt
as
if
it
were
a
defence
of
but
barclay
enlarges
mainly
on
the
medicinal
virtues
of
the
herb
if
tabacco
he
says
were
used
physically
and
with
discretion
there
were
no
medicament
in
the
worlde
comparable
to
it
and
again
in
tabacco
there
is
nothing
which
is
not
medicine
the
root
the
stalke
the
leaves
the
seeds
the
smoake
the
ashes
the
doctor
gives
sundry
directions
for
administering
tobacco
to
be
used
in
infusion
in
decoction
in
substance
in
smoke
in
salt
but
barclay
clearly
does
not
sympathize
with
its
indiscriminate
use
for
pleasure
as
concerning
the
smoke
he
says
it
may
be
taken
more
frequently
and
for
the
said
effects
but
always
fasting
and
with
emptie
stomack
not
as
the
english
abusers
do
which
make
a
of
their
skull
more
fit
to
be
carried
under
his
arme
that
selleth
at
paris
a
to
blacke
mens
shooes
then
to
carie
the
braine
of
him
that
can
not
walke
can
not
ryde
except
the
tabacco
pype
be
in
his
mouth
he
goes
on
to
say
that
he
was
once
in
company
with
an
english
merchant
in
normandy
betweene
rowen
and
who
was
a
merry
fellow
but
was
constantly
wanting
a
coal
to
kindle
his
tobacco
the
frenchman
wondered
and
i
laughed
at
his
intemperancie
it
is
a
little
curious
considering
the
devotion
of
men
of
letters
to
tobacco
that
in
their
early
days
so
many
of
the
men
who
wrote
on
the
subject
attacked
the
social
use
of
tobacco
with
violence
and
virulence
perhaps
they
followed
the
lead
of
the
british
solomon
king
james
i
their
titles
are
characteristic
of
their
style
a
writer
named
deacon
published
in
a
quarto
entitled
tobacco
tortured
in
the
filthy
fumes
of
tobacco
refined
but
joshua
sylvester
had
easily
surpassed
this
when
he
wrote
his
tobacco
battered
and
the
pipes
shattered
about
their
eares
that
idely
idolize
so
base
and
barbarous
a
weed
or
at
least
overlove
so
loathsome
a
vanity
by
a
volley
of
holy
shot
thundered
from
mount
helicon
controversialists
of
that
period
rejoiced
in
titles
and
in
praise
or
abuse
deacon
as
the
title
of
his
book
just
quoted
shows
was
very
fond
of
alliteration
and
one
sentence
of
his
diatribe
may
be
quoted
he
warned
his
readers
that
was
very
pernicious
unto
their
bodies
too
profluvious
for
many
of
their
purses
and
most
pestiferous
to
the
publike
state
much
may
be
forgiven
however
to
the
introducer
of
so
charming
a
term
of
abuse
as
profluvious
book
takes
the
form
of
a
dialogue
and
after
nearly
pages
of
argument
in
which
the
unfortunate
herb
gets
no
mercy
one
of
the
interlocutors
a
trader
in
tobacco
is
so
convinced
of
the
iniquity
of
his
trade
and
of
his
own
parlous
state
if
he
continue
therein
that
he
declares
that
the
two
hundred
pounds
worth
of
this
beastly
tobacco
which
he
owns
shall
presently
packe
to
the
fire
or
else
be
sent
swimming
down
the
thames
many
good
folk
would
seem
to
have
associated
smoking
with
idling
in
the
rules
of
the
grammar
school
at
chigwell
essex
which
was
founded
in
it
is
prescribed
that
the
master
must
be
a
man
of
sound
religion
neither
a
papist
nor
a
puritan
of
a
grave
behaviour
and
sober
and
honest
conversation
no

to
the
fancy
some
amusing
strategic
evasions
and
manœuvres
on
the
part
of
the
conditional
legatee
and
his
watchful
relations
a
converse
view
of
smoking
may
be
seen
in
izaak
walton
life
of
sir
henry
wotton
who
died
in
walton
says
that
wotton
obtained
relief
to
some
extent
from
asthma
by
leaving
off
smoking
which
he
had
practised
somewhat
immoderately
many
thoughtful
men
the
italics
are
mine
tobacco
as
has
been
said
was
praised
as
well
as
abused
extravagantly
much
absurdity
was
written
in
glorification
of
the
medicinal
and
therapeutic
properties
of
tobacco
but
a
more
sensible
note
was
struck
by
some
lauders
of
the
weed
marston
wrote
in
tobacco
sacke
and
sleepe
the
tide
of
sorrow
backward
an
ingenious
lover
of
his
pipe
declared
ironically
in
the
same
year
that
he
had
found
three
bad
qualities
in
tobacco
for
it
made
a
man
a
thief
which
meant
danger
a
good
fellow
which
meant
cost
and
a
niggard
the
name
of
which
is
hateful
it
makes
him
a
theefe
he
continued
for
he
will
steale
it
from
his
father
a
good
fellow
for
he
will
give
the
smoake
to
a
beggar
a
niggard
for
he
will
not
part
with
his
box
to
an
emperor
a
character
in
one
of
chapman
plays
calls
tobacco
the
gentleman
saint
and
the
soldier
idol
a
bard
of
barten
holiday
wrote
a
poem
of
eight
stanzas
with
chorus
to
each
in
praise
of
tobacco
in
which
he
showed
with
a
touch
of
burlesque
that
the
herb
was
a
musician
a
lawyer
a
physician
a
traveller
a
critic
an
ignis
fatuus
and
a
whiffler
a
braggart
the
first
verse
may
suffice
as
a
specimen
a
musician
and
in
a
pipe
delighteth
it
descends
in
a
close
through
the
organ
of
the
nose
with
a
relish
that
these
are
merely
a
few
examples
of
both
the
praise
and
the
abuse
which
were
lavished
upon
tobacco
at
this
early
stage
in
the
history
of
smoking
it
would
be
easy
to
fill
many
pages
with
the
like
testimonials
and
denunciations
especially
the
latter
from
writers
of
the
early
decades
of
the
seventeenth
century
perhaps
the
most
curious
thing
in
connexion
with
the
immense
number
of
allusions
to
smoking
in
the
literature
of
the
period
is
that
there
is
no
mention
whatever
of
tobacco
or
smoking
in
the
plays
of
william
shakespeare
as
edmund
spenser
in
the
faerie
queene
speaks
of
soveraine
weede
divine
it
may
be
presumed
that
he
was
a
smoker
iv
cavalier
and
roundhead
smokers
a
custom
lothsome
to
the
eye
hatefull
to
the
nose
harmefull
to
the
braine
dangerous
to
the
lungs
and
in
the
blacke
stinking
fume
thereof
nearest
resembling
the
horrible
stigian
smoke
of
the
pit
that
is
bottomelesse
james
i
counterblaste
to
the
social
history
of
smoking
from
the
point
of
view
of
fashion
during
the
period
covered
by
this
and
the
next
two
chapters
may
be
summarized
in
a
sentence
through
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
smoking
maintained
its
hold
upon
all
classes
of
society
but
in
the
later
decades
there
are
distinct
signs
that
the
habit
was
becoming
less
universal
and
it
seems
pretty
clear
that
by
the
time
of
queen
anne
smoking
though
still
extensively
practised
in
many
classes
of
society
was
to
a
considerable
extent
out
of
vogue
among
those
most
amenable
to
the
dictates
of
fashion
it
is
certain
that
the
armies
of
the
parliament
were
great
smokers
for
the
finds
of
pipes
on
the
sites
of
their
camps
have
been
numerous
a
considerable
number
of
pipes
of
the
caroline
period
with
the
usual
small
elongated
bowls
were
found
in
at
chichester
in
the
course
of
excavating
the
foundations
of
the
old
swan
inn
east
street
for
building
the
present
branch
of
the
london
and
county
bank
we
know
also
that
the
roundhead
soldiers
smoked
in
circumstances
that
did
them
no
credit
in
the
account
of
the
trial
of
charles
i
written
by
george
bates
principal
physician
to
his
majesty
and
to
charles
ii
also
we
read
that
when
the
sentence
of
the
court
presided
over
by
bradshaw
condemning
the
king
to
death
by
severing
his
head
from
his
body
had
been
read
the
soldiers
treated
the
fallen
monarch
with
great
indignity
and
barbarity
they
spat
on
his
clothes
as
he
passed
by
and
even
in
his
face
and
they
blew
the
smoak
of
tobacco
a
thing
which
they
knew
his
majesty
hated
in
his
sacred
mouth
throwing
their
broken
pipes
in
his
way
as
he
passed
along
time
brought
its
revenges
the
dead
protector
was
not
treated
too
respectfully
by
his
soldiery
evelyn
describing
cromwell
superb
funeral
says
that
the
soldiers
in
the
procession
were
drinking
and
taking
tobacco
in
the
streets
as
they
went
whether
the
use
of
tobacco
prevailed
as
generally
among
the
cavalier
forces
is
less
certain
but
as
king
charles
hated
the
weed
courtiers
may
have
frowned
upon
its
use
one
distinguished
cavalier
however
either
smoked
his
pipe
or
proposed
to
do
so
on
a
historic
occasion
in
markham
life
of
the
great
lord
fairfax
there
is
a
lively
account
of
how
the
duke
then
marquis
of
newcastle
with
his
brother
charles
cavendish
drove
in
a
coach
and
six
to
the
field
of
marston
moor
on
the
afternoon
before
the
battle
his
grace
was
in
a
very
bad
humour
he
applied
to
rupert
says
markham
for
orders
as
to
the
disposal
of
his
own
most
noble
person
and
was
told
that
there
would
be
no
battle
that
night
and
that
he
had
better
get
into
his
coach
and
go
to
sleep
which
he
accordingly
did
but
the
decision
as
to
battle
or
no
battle
did
not
rest
with
prince
rupert
cromwell
attacked
the
royal
army
with
the
most
disastrous
results
to
the
king
cause
his
grace
of
newcastle
woke
up
left
his
coach
and
fought
bravely
being
according
to
his
duchess
the
last
to
ride
off
the
fatal
field
leaving
his
coach
and
six
behind
him
so
far
markham
but
according
to
another
account
when
rupert
told
him
that
there
would
be
no
battle
the
duke
betook
himself
to
his
coach
lit
his
pipe
and
making
himself
very
comfortable
fell
asleep
the
original
authority
however
for
the
whole
story
is
to
be
found
in
a
paper
of
notes
by
clarendon
on
the
affairs
of
the
north
preserved
among
his
mss
in
this
paper
clarendon
writes
the
marq
asked
the
prince
what
he
would
do
his
highness
answered
will
charge
them
morninge
my
lord
asked
him
whether
he
were
sure
the
enimy
would
not
fall
on
them
sooner
he
answered
and
the
marquisse
thereupon
going
to
his
coach
hard
by
and
callinge
for
a

of
tobacco
before
he
could
take
it
the
enimy
charged
and
instantly
all
the
prince
horse
were
routed
gardiner
evidently
follows
this
account
for
his
version
of
the
story
is
newcastle
strolled
towards
his
coach
to
solace
himself
with
a
pipe
before
he
had
time
to
take
a
whiff
the
battle
had
begun
the
incident
was
made
the
subject
of
a
picture
by
ernest
crofts
which
was
exhibited
at
the
royal
academy
in
it
shows
the
duke
leaning
out
of
his
carriage
window
with
his
pipe
in
his
hand
among
the
documents
in
the
possession
of
the
society
of
antiquaries
of
scotland
there
is
a
letter
patent
under
the
great
seal
of
charles
i
in
granted
for
the
purpose
of
correcting
the
irregular
sales
and
restraining
the
immoderate
use
of
tobacco
in
scotland
the
letter
states
that
tobacco
was
used
on
its
first
introduction
as
a
medicine
but
had
since
been
so
largely
indulged
in
and
was
frequently
of
such
bad
quality
as
not
only
to
injure
the
health
but
deprave
the
morals
of
the
king
subjects
these
were
sentiments
worthy
of
king
james
matthew
livingstone
who
has
calendared
this
document
says
that
the
king
therein
proceeds
in
order
to
prevent
such
injurious
results
of
the
use
of
tobacco
to
appoint
sir
james
leslie
and
thomas
dalmahoy
to
enjoy
for
seven
years
the
sole
power
of
appointing
licensed
vendors
of
the
commodity
these
vendors
after
due
examination
as
to
their
fitness
were
to
be
permitted
on
payment
of
certain
compositions
and
an
annual
rent
in
augmentation
of
the
king
revenue
to
sell
tobacco
in
small
quantities
the
letter
further
directs
that
the
licensees
so
appointed
shall
become
bound
to
sell
only
sound
tobacco
an
admirable
provision
if
a
trifle
difficult
to
enforce
and
to
keep
good
order
in
their
houses
and
shops
the
latter
clause
adds
livingstone
would
almost
suggest
that
the
tobacco
was
to
be
sold
for
consumption
on
the
premises
as
i
have
no
doubt
it
was
and
that
the
smokers
were
probably
in
the
habit
at
their
symposiums
of
using
even
as
they
may
still
i
dare
say
other
indulgences
not
so
soothing
in
their
effects
as
the
coveted
weed
a
suggestion
for
which
there
seems
little
foundation
in
the
clause
to
which
livingstone
refers
one
inference
at
least
may
be
fairly
drawn
i
think
from
this
document
and
that
is
that
smoking
was
very
popular
north
as
well
as
south
of
the
tweed
tobacco
was
certainly
cheap
in
scotland
the
following
entries
are
from
a
account
of
household
expenses
kept
by
the
minister
of
the
parish
of
eastwood
near
glasgow
the
rev
william
hamilton
they
cover
two
months
only
and
show
that
the
minister
was
a
furious
smoker
the
prices
given
are
in
scots
currency
the
pound
scots
being
worth
about
twenty
pence
sterling
maii
it
to
andro

it
may
perhaps
be
interesting
to
compare
with
these
prices
from
which
apparently
it
may
be
inferred
that
near
glasgow
tobacco
could
be
bought
for
some
a
pound
which
seems
incredibly
cheap

occasional
expenditure
upon
tobacco

a
worthy
citizen

few
years
earlier
extracts
from
the
financial
diary
of
this
good
man
whose
name
was
john
hayne
and
who
was
an
extensive
dealer
in
serges
and
woollen
goods
generally
as
well
as
in
a
smaller
degree
of
cotton
goods
also
were
printed
some
years
ago
with
copious
annotations
by
the
late
brushfield
in
this
diary
covering
the
years
there
are
some
forty
entries
concerning
the
purchase
of
what
is
always
save
in
one
case
called
tobacka
these
entries
give
valuable
information
as
to
the
prices
of
the
two
chief
kinds
of
tobacco
one
was
imported
from
spanish
america
which
up
to
hayne
calls
varinaes
and
after
that
date
spanish
the
other
was
imported
from
english
colonies
chiefly
from
virginia
the
varinaes
kind
brushfield
suggests
was
obtained
from
varina
near
the
foot
of
the
range
of
mountains
forming
the
west
boundary
of
venezuela
and
watered
by
a
branch
of
the
orinoco
river
hayne
also
notes
the
purchase
of
tertudoes
tobacco
but
what
that
may
have
been
i
can
not
say
from
the
various
entries
relating
respectively
to
varinaes
or
spanish
tobacco
and
to
virginia
tobacco
it
is
clear
that
the
former
ranged
in
price
from
to
per
while
the
latter
was
from
to
per
lb
there
is
one
entry
of
perfumed
tobacka
oz
of
which
were
bought
at
the
very
high
price
of
the
variations
in
price
of
both
spanish
and
virginia
tobacco
were
largely
due
to
the
frequent
changes
in
the
amount
of
the
duty
thereon
in
king
james
i
newly
come
to
the
throne
and
full
of
iconoclastic
fervour
against
the
weed
raised
the
duty
to
per
lb
in
addition
to
the
original
duty
of
on
march
there
was
a
grant
to
a
licensed
importer
of
the
late
imposition
of
per
lb
on
tobacco
which
shows
that
there
must
have
been
considerable
fluctuation
between
and
while
in
september
the
duty
stood
at
through
james
reign
much
dissatisfaction
was
expressed
about
the
importation
of
spanish
tobacco
and
the
outcome
of
this
may
probably
be
seen
in
the
proclamations
issued
by
the
king
in
his
last
two
years
forbidding
the
importation
buying
or
selling
tobacco
which
was
not
of
the
proper
growth
of
the
colonies
of
virginia
and
the
somers
islands
these
proclamations
were
several
times
confirmed
by
charles
i
the
latest
being
on
january
but
they
do
not
seem
to
have
had
much
effect
hayne
diary
contains
one
or
two
entries
relating
to
requisites
in
september
he
spent
on
a
new
spring
to
his
tobacka
tonges
these
were
the
tongs
used
for
lifting
a
live
coal
to
light
the
pipe
to
which
i
have
referred
on
a
previous
page
on
the
last
day
of
hayne
paid
drakes
man
for
doz
from
the
various
entries
in
the
diary
relating
to
the
purchase
of
tobacco
it
seems
clear
that
there
was
no
shop
in
exeter
devoted
specially
or
exclusively
to
the
sale
of
the
weed
hayne
bought
his
supplies
from
four
of
the
leading
goldsmiths
of
the
city
who
can
be
identified
by
the
fact
that
he
had
dealings
with
them
in
their
own
special
wares
also
from
two
drapers
one
grocer
and
four
other
tradesmen
on
a
single
occasion
each
whose
particular
occupations
are
unknown
but
to
turn
from
this
worthy
exeter
citizen
to
more
famous
names
i
do
not
know
of
any
good
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
cromwell
smoked
although
he
is
said
to
have
taken
an
occasional
pipe
while
considering
the
offer
of
the
crown
but
john
milton
certainly
did
the
account
of
how
the
blind
poet
passed
his
days
after
his
retirement
from
public
office
was
first
told
by
his
contemporary
richardson
and
has
since
been
repeated
by
all
his
biographers
his
placid
day
ended
early
the
poet
took
his
frugal
supper
at
eight
and
at
nine
having
smoked
a
pipe
and
drunk
a
glass
of
water
he
went
to
bed
apparently
this
modest
allowance
of
a
daily
evening
pipe
was
the
extent
of
milton
indulgence
in
tobacco
he
knew
nothing
of
what
most
smokers
regard
as
the
best
pipe
of
the
day
the
pipe
it
is
somewhat
singular
that
the
puritans
who
denounced
most
amusements
and
pleasures
and
who
frowned
upon
most
of
the
occupations
or
diversions
that
make
for
gaiety
and
the
enjoyment
of
life
did
not
as
puritans
denounce
the
use
of
tobacco
one
or
two
of
their
writers
abused
it
roundly
but
these
were
not
representative
of
puritan
feeling
on
the
subject
the
explanation
doubtless
is
that
the
practice
of
smoking
was
so
very
general
and
so
much
a
matter
of
course
among
men
of
all
ranks
and
of
all
opinions
that
the
mouths
of
puritans
were
closed
so
to
speak
by
their
own
pipes
a
precisian
however
could
take
his
tobacco
with
a
difference
the
diarist
abraham
de
la
pryme
says
that
he
had
heard
of
a
presbyterian
minister
who
was
so
precise
that
he
would
not
as
much
as
take
a
pipe
of
tobacco
before
that
he
had
first
sayed
grace
over
it
george
wither
one
of
the
most
noteworthy
of
the
poets
who
took
the
side
of
the
parliament
was
confined
in
newgate
after
the
restoration
and
found
comfort
in
his
pipe
some
of
the
puritan
colonists
in
america
took
a
strong
line
on
the
subject
under
the
famous
blue
laws
of
it
was
ordered
by
the
general
court
of
connecticut
that
no
one
under
was
to
smoke
nor
any
other
that
hath
not
already
accustomed
himself
to
the
use
thereof
and
no
smoker
could
enjoy
his
pipe
unless
he
obtained
a
doctor
certificate
that
tobacco
would
be
usefull
for
him
and
allso
that
he
hath
received
a
lycense
from
the
courte
for
the
same
but
the
unhappy
smoker
having
passed
the
doctor
and
obtained
his
licence
was
still
harassed
by
restrictions
for
it
was
ordered
that
no
man
within
the
colony
after
the
publication
of
the
order
should
take
any
tobacco
publicly
in
the
streett
highwayes
or
any
or
uppon
training
dayes
in
any
open
places
under
the
penalty
of
for
each
offence
against
this
order
the
ingenuities
of
petty
tyranny
are
ineffable
it
is
said
that
these
blue
laws
are
not
authentic
but
if
they
are
not
literally
true
they
are
certainly
well
invented
for
most
of
them
can
be
paralleled
and
illustrated
by
laws
and
regulations
of
undoubted
authenticity
alice
morse
earle
in
her
interesting
book
abounding
in
curious
information
on
the
sabbath
in
puritan
new
england
says
that
the
use
of
tobacco
was
absolutely
forbidden
under
any
circumstances
on
the
sabbath
within
two
miles
of
the
which
since
at
that
date
all
the
houses
were
clustered
round
the
was
equivalent
to
not
smoking
it
at
all
on
the
lord
day
if
the
law
were
obeyed
but
wicked
backsliders
existed
poor
slaves
of
habit
who
were
in
duxbury
fixed
for
each
offence
and
in
portsmouth
not
only
were
fined
but
to
their
shame
be
it
told
set
as
in
the
portsmouth
cage
in
sandwich
and
in
boston
the
fine
for
tobacco
in
the
was
for
each
drink
which
i
take
to
mean
chewing
tobacco
rather
than
smoking
it
many
men
were
fined
for
thus
drinking
and
solacing
the
weary
hours
though
doubtless
they
were
as
sly
and
kept
themselves
as
unobserved
as
possible
four
yarmouth
men
old
perhaps
who
loved
their
pipe
were
in
fined
each
for
smoking
tobacco
around
the
end
of
the
silly
yarmouth
men
to
fancy
to
escape
detection
by
hiding
around
the
corner
of
the
church
and
to
think
that
the
had
no
nose
when
he
was
so
on
weekdays
many
new
england
puritans
probably
smoked
as
their
friends
in
old
england
did
a
contemporary
painting
of
a
group
of
puritan
divines
over
the
mantelpiece
of
parson
lowell
of
newbury
shows
them
well
provided
with
and
tobacco
and
pipes
one
parson
the
rev
bradstreet
of
the
first
church
of
charlestown
was
very
unconventional
in
his
attire
he
seldom
wore
a
coat
but
generally
appeared
in
a
plaid
gown
and
was
always
seen
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
john
eliot
the
noble
preacher
and
missionary
to
the
indians
warmly
denounced
both
the
wearing
of
wigs
and
the
smoking
of
tobacco
but
his
denunciations
were
ineffectual
in
both
matters
heads

to
be
adorned
with

country
tobacco
is
said
to
have
invaded
even
the
house
of
commons
itself
burn
in
his
descriptive
catalogue
of
london
tokens
writes
about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
it
was
ordered
that
no
member
of
the
house
do
presume
to
smoke
tobacco
in
the
gallery
or
at
the
table
of
the
house
sitting
as
committees
i
do
not
know
what
the
authority
for
this
order
may
be
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
smoking
was
practised
in
the
precincts
of
the
house
in
mercurius
pragmaticus
december
the
writer
says
on
december
speaking
of
the
excluded
members
col
pride
standing
sentinell
at
the
door
denyed
entrance
and
caused
them
to
retreat
into
the
lobby
where
they
used
to
drink
ale
and
tobacco
there
is
a
curious
entry
in
thomas
burton
diary
of
the
proceedings
of
cromwell
parliament
which
suggests
that
there
may
then
have
been
the
luxury
of
a
members
burton
was
a
member
of
the
parliaments
of
oliver
and
richard
cromwell
from
to
and
made
a
practice
for
which
historical
students
have
been
and
are
much
his
debtors
of
taking
notes
of
the
debates
as
he
sat
in
the
house
members
sometimes
objected
to
and
protested
against
this
but
burton
quietly
went
on
using
his
pencil
and
though
his
summaries
of
speeches
are
often
difficult
to
follow
argument
and
sense
suffering
by
compression
he
has
preserved
much
very
valuable
matter
referring
to
a
debate
on
january
on
an
attempt
to
go
behind
the
previously
passed
act
of
oblivion
the
diarist
records
that
sir
john
reynolds
had
numbered
the
house
and
said
at
rising
there
were
at
the
least
besides
tobacconists
this
can
only
mean
that
there
were
at
least
members
actually
present
in
the
house
when
it
rose
not
counting
the
tobacconists
or
smokers
who
were
enjoying
their
pipes
not
in
the
chamber
itself
but
in
some
conveniently
adjoining
place
which
may
have
been
a
room
for
the
purpose
or
may
simply
have
been
the
lobby
referred
to
above
in
the
extract
from
mercurius
pragmaticus
it
seems
likely
that
richard
cromwell
was
a
smoker
in
long
after
he
had
retired
into
private
life
and
had
ample
leisure
for
blowing
clouds
he
sent
to
a
friend
a
boxe
of
tobacco
which
was
described
as
bod
den
best
virginnea
in
a
letter
to
his
daughter
elizabeth
dated
january
there
is
a
reference
to
this
same
dealer
whom
he
describes
as
adam
bodden
bacconist
in
george
yard
lumber
lombard
street
the
allusion
is
worth
noting
as
a
very
early
instance
of
the
colloquial
trick
of
abbreviation
familiar
in
later
days
in
such
forms
as
baccy
and
bacca
and
their
compounds
v
smoking
in
the
restoration
period
the
indian
weed
withered
quite
green
at
noon
cut
down
at
night
shows
thy
decay
all

hay
thus
think
then

george

the
year
that
restored
charles
ii
to
his
throne
restored
a
gaiety
and
brightness
not
to
say
frivolity
of
tone
that
had
long
been
absent
from
english
life
the
following
song
in
praise
of
tobacco
taken
from
a
collection
which
was
printed
in
is
touched
with
the
spirit
of
the
time
though
it
is
really
founded
on
and
to
no
small
extent
taken
from
some
verses
in
praise
of
tobacco
written
by
samuel
rowlands
in
his
knave
of
clubs
feed
on
flesh
is
gluttony
it
maketh
men
fat
like
swine
but
is
not

a
frugal
man
that
on

for
to
foul
his
fingers

to

his

in
a
box
and
roast
meat
in

the
cause
wherefore
few
rich
men

prove
disputants
in
schools
is
that
their
fathers
fed
on
flesh
and
they
begat
fat
fools
this
fulsome
feeding
cloggs
the
brain
and
doth
the
stomach
choak
but
he
a
brave
spark
that
can
dine
with
one
light
dish
of
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
king
charles
smoked
nor
what
his
personal
attitude
towards
tobacco
may
have
been
his
majesty
was
pleased
however
in
a
letter
to
cambridge
university
officially
to
condemn
smoking
by
parsons
as
at
the
same
time
he
condemned
the
practice
of
and
of
by
the
clergy
but
the
royal
frown
was
without
effect
wigs
soon
covered
nearly
every
clerical
head
from
the
bench
of
bishops
downwards
and
it
is
very
doubtful
indeed
whether
a
single
parson
put
his
pipe
out
clouds

dined

he
sat
at
the

of

between
the

two
chaplains
and
when
dinner
was
finished
sheldon
we
are
told
retired
to

eachard
went
with
the

and
another
convive
to
their
lodgings
to
drink
and
smoak

the
restored
king
did
not
himself
smoke
tobacco
was
far
from
unknown
at
the
palace
of
whitehall
we
get
a
curious
glimpse
of
one
aspect
of
life
there
in
the
picture
which
lilly
the
notorious
astrologer
paints
in
his
story
of
his
arrest
in
january
he
was
taken
to
whitehall
at
night
and
kept
in
a
large
room
with
some
sixty
other
prisoners
till
daylight
when
he
was
transferred
to
the
guardroom
which
he
says
i
thought
to
be
hell
some
therein
were
sleeping
others
swearing
others
smoaking
tobacco
in
the
chimney
of
the
room
i
believe
there
was
two
bushels
of
broken
tobacco
pipes
almost
half
one
load
of
ashes
what
would
the
king
grandfather
the
author
of
the
counterblaste
have
said
could
he
have
imagined
such
a
spectacle
within
the
palace
walls
general
monk
to
whom
charles
ii
owed
so
much
is
said
to
have
indulged
in
the
unpleasant
habit
of
chewing
tobacco
and
to
have
been
imitated
by
others
but
the
practice
can
never
have
been
common
tobacco
was
still
the
symbol
of
winstanley
who
was
an
enemy
of
what
he
called
this
heathenish
weed
and
who
thought
the
folly
of
smoking
might
never
have
spread
so
much
if
stringent
means
of
prevention
had
been
exercised
yet
had
to
declare
in
that
tobacco
it
self
is
by
few
taken
now
as
medicinal
it
is
grown
a
and
fallen
from
a
physician
to
a
complement
no
that
without
burnt
pipes
tobacco
and
his
at
the
time
of
the
restoration
which
were
considered
suitable
to
the
occasion
were
made
in
large
numbers
the
outside
of
the
lid
bore
a
portrait
of
the
royal
martyr
within
the
lid
was
a
picture
of
the
restored
king
his
majesty
king
charles
ii
while
on
the
inside
of
the
bottom
of
the

was

against
a

a

his

and
about
his
neck

halter
tied
to

while
beside
him
was
pictured
the

another
form
of

is
described
in
an
advertisement
in
the
of

this
was
a

had
either
been
taken
out

although
smoking
was
general
among

yet
attacks
on
tobacco
were
occasionally
heard
from
pulpits
a
lancashire
preacher
named
thomas
jollie
who
was
one
of
the
ministers
ejected
from
church
livings
by
the
act
of
uniformity
has
left
a
manuscript
diary
relating
to
his
religious
work
in
it
under
date
he
mentions
that
he
had
spoken
against
the
inordinate
affection
to
and
the
immoderate
use
of
tobacco
which
did
caus
much
trouble
in
some
of
my
hearers
and
some
reformation
did
follow
he
then
goes
on
to
record
two
remarkable
examples
of
such
reformation
examples
he
says
which
did
stirr
me
up
in
that
case
more
than
ordinary
the
one
i
had
from
my
reverend
brother
robert
whittaker
concerning
a
professor
a
person
who
professed
to
have
been
converted
who
could
not
follow
his
calling
without
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
but
that
text
isaiah
coming
into
his
mind
hee
layd
aside
his
taking
of
tobacco
the
other
instance
was
of
a
profane
person
living
nigh
haslingdon
who
was
but
poor
and
took
up
his
time
in
the
trade
of
smoking
and
also
spent
what
should
reliev
his
poor
family
this
man
dreamed
that
he
was
taking
tobacco
and
that
the
devill
stood
by
him
filling
one
pipe
upon
another
for
him
in
the
morning
hee
fell
to
his
old
cours
notwithstanding
thinking
it
was
but
a
dream
but
when
hee
came
to
take
his
pipe
hee
had
such
an
apprehension
that
the
devill
did
indeed
stand
by
him
and
doe
the
office
as
hee
dreamed
that
hee
was
struck
speechless
for
a
time
and
when
hee
came
to
himself
hee
threw
his
tobacco
in
the
fire
and
his
pipes
at
the
walls
resolving
never
to
meddle
more
with
it
soe
much
money
as
was
formerly
wasted
by
the
week
in
to
serving
his
family
afterward
weekly
among
the
many
medicinal
virtues
attributed
to
tobacco
was
its
supposed
value
as
a
preservative
from
contagion
at
times
of
plague
hearne
the
antiquary
writing
early
in
said
that
he
had
been
told
that
in
the
great
plague
of
london
of
none
of
those
who
kept
tobacconists
shops
suffered
from
it
and
this
belief
no
doubt
enhanced
the
medical
reputation
of
the
weed
i
have
also
seen
it
stated
that
during
the
cholera
epidemics
of
and
not
one
london
tobacconist
died
from
that
disease
but
good
authority
for
the
statement
seems
to
be
lacking
hutton
in
his
history
of
derby
says
that
when
that
town
was
visited
by
the
plague
in
that
at
the
the
having
their
mouths
primed
with
tobacco
as
a
preservative
brought
their
provisions
it
was
observed
that
this
cruel
affliction
never
attempted
the
premises
of
a
tobacconist
a
tanner
or
a
shoemaker
whatever
ground
there
may
have
been
for
the
belief
in
the
prophylactic
effect
of
smoking
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
in
the
seventeenth
century
it
was
firmly
held
howell
in
one
of
his
familiar
letters
dated
january
says
that
the
smoke
of
tobacco
is
one
of
the
wholesomest
sents
that
is
against
all
contagious
airs
for
it
overmasters
all
other
smells
as
king
james
they
say
found
true
when
being
once
a
hunting
a
showr
of
rain
drave
him
into
a
pigsty
for
shelter
wher
he
caus
a
pipe
full
to
be
taken
of
purpose
but
here
howell
is
certainly
drawing
the
one
can
not
imagine
the
author
of
the
counterblaste
countenancing
the
use
of
tobacco
under
any
circumstances
at
the
time
of
the
great
plague
all
kinds
of
nostrums
were
sold
and
recommended
as
preservatives
or
as
cures
most
of
these
perished
with
the
occasion
that
called
them
forth
but
the
names
of
some
have
been
preserved
in
a
rare
quarto
tract
which
was
published
in
the
plague
year
entitled
a
brief
treatise
of
the
nature
causes
signes
preservation
from
and
cure
of
the
pestilence
collected
by
kemp
of
arts
in
the
list
of
devices
for
purifying
infected
air
it
is
stated
that
the
american
or
tobacco
is
very
excellent
for
this
purpose
and
an
excellent
defence
against
bad
air
being
smoked
in
a
pipe
either
by
itself
or
with
nutmegs
shred
and
rew
seeds
mixed
with
it
especially
if
it
be
nosed
which
i
suppose
means
if
the
smoke
be
exhaled
through
the
nose
for
it
cleanseth
the
air
and
choaketh
suppresseth
and
disperseth
any
venomous
vapour
kemp
warms
to
his
subject
and
proceeds
with
a
panegyric
that
must
be
quoted
in
full
it
hath
singular
and
contrary
effects
it
is
good
to
warm
one
being
cold
and
will
cool
one
being
hot
all
ages
all
sexes
all
constitutions
young
and
old
men
and
women
the
sanguine
the
cholerick
the
melancholy
the
phlegmatick
take
it
without
any
manifest
inconvenience
it
quencheth
thirst
and
yet
will
make
one
more
able
and
fit
to
drink
it
abates
hunger
and
yet
will
get
one
a
good
stomach
it
is
agreeable
with
mirth
or
sadness
with
feasting
and
with
fasting
it
will
make
one
rest
that
wants
sleep
and
will
keep
one
waking
that
is
drowsie
it
hath
an
offensive
smell
to
some
and
is
more
desirable
than
any
perfume
to
others
that
it
is
a
most
excellent
preservative
both
experience
and
reason
do
teach
it
corrects
the
air
by
fumigation
and
it
avoids
corrupt
humours
by
salivation
for
when
one
takes
it
either
by
chewing
it
in
the
leaf
or
smoaking
it
in
the
pipe
the
humors
are
drawn
and
brought
from
all
parts
of
the
body
to
the
stomach
and
from
thence
rising
up
to
the
mouth
of
the
tobacconist

to

helme
of
a
sublimatory
are
voided
and
spitten
out
when
plague
was
abroad
even
children
were
compelled
to
smoke
at
the
time
of
the
dreadful
visitation
of
all
the
boys
at
eton
were
obliged
to
smoke
in
school
every
morning
one
of
these
juvenile
smokers
a
certain
tom
rogers
years
afterwards
declared
to
hearne
the
oxford
antiquary
that
he
never
was
whipped
so
much
in
his
life
as
he
was
one
morning
for
not
smoking
times
have
changed
at
eton
since
this
martyr
received
his
whipping
it
is
sometimes
stated
that
at
this
time
smoking
was
generally
practised
in
schools
and
that
at
a
stated
hour
each
morning
lessons
were
laid
aside
and
masters
and
scholars
alike
produced
their
pipes
and
proceeded
to
smoke
tobacco
but
i
know
of
no
authority
for
this
wider
statement
it
seems
to
have
grown
out
of
hearne
record
of
the
practice
at
eton
the
belief
in
the
prophylactic
power
of
tobacco
was
however
very
generally
held
when
samuel
pepys
on
june
for
the
first
time
saw
several
houses
marked
with
the
ominous
red
cross
and
the
words
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
chalked
upon
the
doors
he
felt
so
ill
at
ease
that
he
was
obliged
to
buy
some
roll
tobacco
to
smell
and
chew
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
pepys
even
smoked
which
considering
his
proficiency
in
the
arts
of
is
perhaps
a
little
surprising
defoe
in
his
fictitious
but
graphic
journal
of
the
plague
year
in
london
says
that
the
sexton
of
one
of
the
london
parishes
who
personally
handled
a
large
number
of
the
victims
never
had
the
distemper
at
all
but
lived
about
twenty
years
after
it
and
was
sexton
of
the
parish
to
the
time
of
his
death
this
man
according
to
defoe
never
used
any
preservative
against
the
infection
other
than
holding
garlic
and
rue
in
his
mouth
and
smoking
tobacco
when
excavations
were
in
progress
early
in
preparatory
to
the
construction
of
kingsway
and
aldwych
they
included
the
removal
of
bodies
from
the
of
clement
danes
and
and
among
the
bones
were
found
a
couple
of
the
curious
called
because
they
are
supposed
to
have
been
used
as
a
protection
against
infection
by
those
whose
office
it
was
to
bury
the
dead
these
pipes
have
been
dug
up
from
time
to
time
in
numbers
so
large
that
one
antiquary
syer
cuming
has
ventured
to
infer
that
almost
every
person
who
ventured
from
home
invoked
the
protection
of
tobacco
these
pipes
were
largely
made
in
holland
of
imported
from
england
to
the
disgust
and
loss
of
english
in
the
company
of
makers
petitioned
parliament
to
forbid
the
export
of
tobacco
pipe
clay
since
by
the
manufacture
of
pipes
in
holland
their
trade
is
much
damaged
further
they
asked
for
the
confirmation
of
their
charter
of
government
so
as
to
empower
them
to
regulate
abuses
as
many
persons
engage
in
the
trade
without
licence
the
company
request
was
granted
but
in
the
next
year
they
again
found
it
necessary
to
come
to
parliament
showing
the
great
improvement
in
their
trade
since
their
incorporation
james
i
and
their
threatened
ruin
because
cooks
bakers
and
keepers
and
others
make
pipes
but
so
unskilfully
that
they
are
brought
into
disesteem
they
request
to
be
comprehended
in
the
statute
of
labourers
of
elizabeth
so
that
none
may
follow
the
trade
who
have
not
been
apprentices
seven
years
making
was
a
flourishing
industry
at
this
period
and
throughout
the
seventeenth
and
following
century
in
most
of
the
chief
provincial
towns
and
cities
as
well
as
in
london
old
english
says
cooper
are
exceedingly
interesting
as
most
of
them
are
branded
with
the
maker
initials
monograms
and
designs
were
stamped
or
moulded
upon
the
bowls
and
on
the
stems
but
more
generally
upon
the
spur
or
flat
heel
of
the
pipe
many
pipes
display
on
the
heels
various
forms
of
lines
hatched
and
milled
which
were
perhaps
the
earliest
marks
of
identification
adopted
by
the
in
a
careful
examination
of
the
monograms
we
are
able
to
identify
the
makers
of
certain
pipes
found
in
quantities
at
various
places
by
reference
to
the
freeman
and
burgess
rolls
and
parish
registers
during
the
latter
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
english
pipes
were
presented
by
colonists
in
america
to
the
indians
they
subsequently
became
valuable
as
objects
of
barter
or
part
purchase

in
exchange
for
land
in
one
hundred
and
twenty
pipes
and
one
hundred

were
given
for
a
strip
of
country
near
timber
creek
in
new

william
penn
the
founder
of

purchased
a
tract
of
land
and
pipes
were
included
in
the
articles

traveller
sorbière
who

that
the
english
were
naturally
lazy
and
spent
half
their
time
in
taking
tobacco
they
smoked
after
meals
he
observed
and
conversed
for
a
long
time
there
is
scarce

he
wrote
but
a
tradesman
goes
to
the
or
tavern
to
smoke
with
some
of
his
friends
and
therefore
public
houses
are
numerous
here

business
goes
on
but
slowly
in
the
shops
but
curiously
enough
he
makes
no
mention
of
a
little
later
they
were
too
common
and
too
much
frequented
to
be
overlooked
an
english
writer
on
thrift
in
said
that
it
was
customary
for
a
mechanic
tradesman
to
go
to
the
or
in
the
morning
to
drink
his
draught
and
there
he
would
spend
twopence
and
consume
an
hour
in
smoking
and
talking
spending
several
hours
of
the
evening
in
similar
fashion
country
gentlemen
smoked
just
as
much
as
town

and
tradesmen

earl

to
thomas

of

probably
soon
after

which
it
retained
with
good

long
as
it
stood

should
like
to
know
on

authority
sir

these

were
known
in
later
days
as
the
floor
being
flagged
for
safety
sake
and
the
in
many
a

the
scene

conviviality

no

abundant
smoking

arrival
of
coffee

the
establishment

new
field

the

was
opened

soon
followed
and
in
a
short
time
the
new
beverage
had
captured
the
town
and
had
been
opened
in
every
direction
they
sold
many
things
besides
coffee
and
served
a
variety
of
purposes
but
primarily
they
were
temples
of
talk
and
the
buzz
of
conversation
and
the
smoke
of
tobacco
alike
filled
the
rooms

this

granger
long
ago
remarked
that
most
of
the
eminent
divines
and
bishops
of
the
day
contributed
very
practically
to
the
payment
of
this
revolutionary
debt
by
their
large
consumption
of
tobacco
he
mentions
isaac
barrow
barlow
of
lincoln
who
was
as
regular
in
smoking
tobacco
as
at
his
meals
and
had
a
high
opinion
of
its
virtues
aldrich
and
other
celebrated
persons
who
flourished
about
this
time
and
gave
much
into
that
practice
one
of
the
best
known
of
these
celebrated
persons
was
gilbert
burnet
bishop
of
salisbury
from
and
historian
of
his
own
times
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
an
inveterate
smoker
and
was
caricatured
with
a
long
clay
stuck
through
the
brim
of
the
shovel
hat
on
the
breadth
of
which
king
william
once
made
remark
the
bishop
replied
that
the
hat
was
of
a
shape
suited
to
his
dignity
whereupon
the
king
caustically
said

but
there
is
no
evidence
that
dryden
smoked
the
was
his
symbol
of
authority
budding
wits
thought
themselves
highly
distinguished
if
they
could
obtain
the
honour
of
being
allowed
to
take
a
pinch
from
it
of
aldrich
who
was
dean
of
christ
church
oxford
and
who
wrote
a
curious
catch
not
more
difficult
to
sing
than
diverting
to
hear
to
be
sung
by
four
men
smoaking
their
pipes
an
anecdote
has
often
been
related
which
illustrates
his
devotion
to
the
weed
a
bet
was
made
by
one
undergraduate
and
taken
by
another
that
at
whatever
time
however
early
the
dean
might
be
visited
in
his
own
den
he
would
be
found
smoking
as
soon
as
the
bet
had
been
made
the
dean
was
visited
the
pair
explained
the
reason
for
their
call
when
aldrich
who
must
have
been
a
man
said
your
friend
has
lost
i
am
not
smoking
only
filling
my
pipe
john
philips
the
author
of
cyder
and
the
splendid
shilling
was
an
undergraduate
at
christ
church
during
aldrich
term
of
office
and
no
doubt
learned
to
smoke
in
an
atmosphere
so
favourable
to
tobacco
in
his
splendid
shilling
which
dates
from
about
philips
says
of
the
happy
man
with
a
shilling
in
his
pocket
he
smokes
and
laughs
at
merry
tale
or
pun
ambiguous
or
conundrum
but
the
poor
shillingless
wretch
can
only
at
home
in
garret
vile
and
with
a
warming
puff
regale
chill
fingers
or
from
tube
as
black
as
or
jet
exhale
mundungus
the
miserable
creature
though
without
a
shilling
yet
possessed
a
clay
it
is
significant
that
the
writer
of
a
life
of
philips
which
was
prefixed
to
an
edition
of
his
poems
which
was
published
in
after
mentioning
that
smoking
was
common
at
oxford
in
the
days
of
aldrich
says
apologetically
it
is
no
wonder
therefore
that
he
philips
fell
in
with
the
general
taste
he
has
descended
to
sing
its
praises
in
more
than
one
place
by
as
we
shall
see
smoking
was
quite
unfashionable
and
consequently
it
was
necessary
to
explain
how
it
was
that
a
poet
could
descend
so
low
as
to
sing
the
praises
of
tobacco
other
men
of
the
late
seventeenth
century
were
tobacconists
in
the
old
sense
of
the
word
sir
isaac
newton
is
said
to
have
smoked
immoderately
and
a
familiar
anecdote
represents
him
as
using
for
the
purposes
of
a
in
a
fit
of
the
little
finger
of
a
lady
sitting
beside
him
whom
he
admired
but
the
truth
of
this
legend
is
open
to
doubt
thomas
hobbes
who
lived
to
be
ninety
was
accustomed
to
dine
at
after
which
he
smoked
a
pipe
and
then
lay
down
and
took
a
nap
of
about
half
an
hour
no
doubt
he
would
have
attributed
the
length
of
his
days
to
the
regularity
of
his
habits
izaak
walton
who
also
lived
to
be
ninety
as
the
lover
of
the
placid
and
contemplative
life
deserved
to
do
loved
his
pipe
though
he
seldom
mentions
smoking
in
the
compleat
angler
sir
samuel
garth
poet
and
physician
once
known
to
fame
as
the
author
of
the
dispensary
was
another
as
is
shown
by
his
verses
quoted
at
the
head
of
this
chapter
dudley
the
fourth
lord
north
began
to
smoke
in
and
says
jessopp
the
habit
grew
upon
him
the
frequent
entries
for
pipes
and
tobacco
showing
that
he
became
more
and
more
addicted
to
this
indulgence
probably
it
afforded
him
some
solace
in
the
dreadful
malady
from
which
he
suffered
so
long
even
the
staid
quakers
smoked
george
fox
position
in
regard
to
tobacco
was
curious
he
did
not
smoke
himself
but
on
one
occasion
he
was
offered
a
pipe
by
a
jesting
youth
who
thought
thereby
to
shock
so
saintly
a
person
fox
says
in
his
journal
i
lookt
upon
him
to
bee
a
forwarde
bolde
lad
and
tobacco
i
did
not
take
butt
i
saw
hee
had
a
flashy
empty
notion
of
religion
soe
i
took
his
pipe
and
putt
it
to
my
mouth
and
gave
it
to
him
again
to
stoppe
him
lest
his
rude
tongue
should
say
i
had
not
unity
with
ye
creation
the
incident
is
curious
but
testifies
to
fox
tolerance
and
breadth
of
outlook
many
of
his
followers
smoked
sometimes
apparently
to
such
an
extent
as
to
cause
scandal
among
their
brethren
the
following
is
an
entry
in
the
minutes
of
the
friends
monthly
meeting
at
hardshaw
lancashire
of
mo
it
being
considered
that
the
too
frequent
use
of
smoking
tobacco
is
inconsistent
with
friends
holy
profession
it
is
desired
that
such
as
have
occasion
to
make
use
thereof
take
it
privately
neither
too
publicly
in
their
own
houses
nor
by
the
highways
streets
or
in
alehouses
or
elsewhere
tending
to
the
abetting
the
common
excess
another
lancashire
monthly
meeting
penketh
under
date
mo
suggested
that
friends
were
not
to
smoke
during
their
labour
or
occupation
but
to
leave
their
work
and
take
it
privately
a
suggestion
which
clearly
proceeded
from
the
smug
propriety
of
these
recommendations
to
enjoy
a
smoke
in
private
is
delightful
at
the
quarterly
meeting
of
aberdeen
friends
in
a
weighty
paper
containing
several
heads
of
solid
advyces
and
counsells
to
friends
sent
by
irish
quakers
was
read
these
counsels
abound
with
amusingly
prim
suggestions
among
them
is
the
warning
to
take
heed
of
being
overcome
with
strong
drink
or
tobacco
which
many
by
custome
are
brought
into
bondag
to
the
creature
the
aberdeen
friends
themselves
a
little
later
were
greatly
concerned
at
the
increasing
indulgence
in
superfluous
apparell
and
in
vain
recreations
among
the
young
ones
and
in
they
issued
a
paper
dealing
in
great
detail
with
matters
of
dress
and
deportment
among
a
hundred
other
things
treated
with
minutest
particularity
the
desire
is
expressed
that
all
idle
and
needless
smoaking
of
tobacco
be
forborn
william
penn
did
not
like
tobacco
and
was
often
annoyed
by
it
in
america
clarkson
his
biographer
relates
that
on
one
occasion
penn
called
to
see
some
old
friends
at
burlington
who
had
been
smoking
but
who
in
consideration
for
his
feelings
had
put
their
pipes
away
penn
smelt
the
tobacco
and
noticing
that
the
pipes
were
concealed
said
well
friends
i
am
glad
that
you
are
at
last
ashamed
of
your
old
practice
not
entirely
so
replied
one
of
the
company
but
we
preferred
laying
down
our
pipes
to
the
danger
of
offending
a
weaker
brother
many
of
the
used
in
the
latter
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
were
imported
from
holland
they
were
long
or
oval
and
were
usually
made
of
brass
they
can
be
easily
identified
by
their
engraved
subjects
and
dutch
inscriptions
an
example
in
the
colchester
museum
is
made
of
copper
and
brass
with
embossed
designs
and
inscriptions
representing
commerce
on
the
base
and
lid
it
has
engraved
on
the
sides
the
name
and
address
of
its
owner
barnabas
barker
wyvenhoe
essex
the
similar
boxes
later
made
in
england
usually
had
embossed
ornamentation
the
local
authorities
in
our
eastern
counties
seem
to
have
had
some
curious
ideas
of
their
own
as
to
where
tobacco
should
or
should
not
be
smoked
in
a
previous
chapter
we
have
seen
that
at
norwich
keepers
were
fined
for
permitting
smoking
in
their
houses
at
methwold
suffolk
the
folk
improved
upon
this
the
of
the
manor
of
methwold
contain
the
following
entry
made
at
a
court
held
on
october
we
agree
that
any
person
that
is
taken
smoakeinge
tobacco
in
the
street
shall
forfitt
one
shillinge
for
every
time
so
taken
and
itt
shall
be
lawfull
for
the
petty
constabbles
to
distrane
for
the
same
for
to
be
putt
to
the
uses
abovesaid
to
the
use
of
the
town
wee
present
nicholas
baker
for
smoakeinge
in
the
street
and
doe
amerce
him
the
same
rule
is
repeated
at
courts
held
in
the
years
and
but
no
other
fine
is
mentioned
at
any
subsequent
courts
the
good
folk
at
methwold
may
have
been
adepts
at
petty
tyranny
but
such
an
absurd
regulation
must
soon
have
become
a
dead
letter
while
we
are
in
the
eastern
counties
we
may
note
that
in
there
died
at
ely
an
apothecary
named
henry
crofts
who
owned
among
some
other
unusual
items
in
his
inventory
casks
of
brandy
and
tobacco
which
shows
that
even
at
that
date
when
regular
tobacconists
shops
for
the
sale
of
tobacco
had
long
been
common
the
old
business
connexion
between
apothecaries
and
tobacco
still
occasionally
existed
the
clay
pipes
called
aldermen
with
longer
stems
than
their
predecessors
tipped
with
glaze
came
into
use
towards
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
they
must
not
be
confused
with
the
much
longer
churchwarden
or
yard
of
clay
which
was
not
in
vogue
till
the
early
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
towards
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
signs
may
be
detected
of
some
waning
in
the
universal
popularity
of
tobacco
there
are
hints
of
change
in
the
records
of
city
and
other
companies
tobacco
had
always
figured
prominently
in
the
provision
for
trade
feasts
in
the
chester
company
of
barbers
surgeons
wax
and
tallow
chandlers
a
remarkably
comprehensive
organization
paid
for
sack
beere
and
tobacco
at
the
talbot
on
luke
day
october
on
the
occasion
of
a
dinner
given
to
the
company
by
one
richard
walker
and
similar
expenditure
was
common
among
both
london
and
provincial
companies
the
of
the
skinners
company
of
london
show
that
in
preparation
for
their
annual
election
dinner
in
the
cook
appeared
before
the
court
and
produced
a
bill
of
fare
which
with
some
alterations
was
agreed
to
the
butler
then
appeared
and
undertook
to
provide
knives
salt
glasses
sauces
and
everything
needfull
for
and
if
he
gives
content
then
to
have
he
provides
all
things
but
pipes
tobacco
candles
and
beer
which
apparently
fell
to
the
lot
of
some
other
caterer
but
so
early
as
there
is
a
sign
of
change
of
custom
a
change
that
is
in
the
direction
of
restricting
and
limiting
the
hitherto
unbounded
freedom
granted
to
the
use
of
tobacco
the
london
society
of
apothecaries
on
august
held
a
meeting
for
the
election
of
a
master
and
an
upper
warden
and
from
the
minutes
of
this
meeting
we
learn
that
by
general
consent
it
was
forbidden
henceforward
to
smoke
in
the
court
room
while
dining
or
sitting
under
penalty
of
half
a
crown
the
more
fashionable
folk
of
the
restoration
era
and
later
began
to
leave
off
if
not
to
disdain
the
up
to
about
smoking
had
been
permitted
in
the
public
rooms
at
bath
but
when
nash
then
took
charge
tobacco
was
banished
public
or
at
least
fashionable
taste
had
begun
to
change
and
nash
correctly
interpreted
and
led
it
sorbière
who
has
been
quoted
in
the
previous
chapter
remarked
in
that
people
of
quality
did
not
use
tobacco
so
much
as
others
and
towards
the
end
of
the
century
and
in
queen
anne
time
the
tendency
was
for
tobacco
to
go
out
of
fashion
this
did
not
much
affect
its
general
use
but
the
tendency
with
exceptions
no
doubt
was
to
restrict
the
use
of
tobacco
to
the
clergy
to
country
squires
to
merchants
and
tradesmen
and
to
the
humbler
ranks
of
society
to
limit
it
in
short
to
the
middle
and
lower
classes
of
the
social
commonwealth
as
then
organized
in
the
extraordinary
record
of
inanity
which
addison
printed
as
the
diary
of
a
citizen
in
the
of
march
the
devotion
of
the
worthy
retired
tradesman
to
tobacco

that

could
be
well
studied
at
the
he
was
probably
not
a

himself
for
he
goes
on
to
say
that
in
other
respects
the
are
loathsome
full
of
smoke
like
a
guardroom
and
as
much
crowded
he
further
observed
that
it
was
common
to
see
the
clergy
of
london
in
and
even
in
taverns
with
pipes
in
their
mouths

sneeringly

some
going
some
coming
some
scribbling
some
talking
some
drinking

smoking

jingling
and
the
whole

stinking
of
tobacco

a
dutch
scoot
or
a

each
of

stuck
in

took
a
different

to

ralph
thoresby
the
leeds
antiquary
tells
a
strange
story
he
declares
that
one
evening
which
he
spent
with
his
brother
at
garraway
february
he
was
surprised
to
see
his
brother
sickly
child
of
three
years
old
fill
its
pipe
of
tobacco
and
smoke
it
as
as
a
man
of
three
score
after
that
a
second
and
a
third
pipe
without
the
least
concern
as
it
is
said
to
have
done
above
a
year
ago
a
child
of
two
years
of
age
smoking
three
pipes
in
succession
is
a
picture
a
little
difficult
to
accept
as
true
as
this
is
the
only
reference
to
tobacco
in
the
whole
of
his
diary
it
is
not
likely
that
thoresby
was
himself
a
smoker
at
the
entrance
was
the
bar
presided
over
by
the
predecessors
of
the
modern
barmaids
grumbled
at
in
a
as
idols
who
there
received
homage
from
their
admirers
and
who
paid
more
attention
to
customers
who
flirted
with
them
than
to
more
visitors
they
are
described
by
tom
brown
as
a
charming
phillis
or
two
who
invited
you
by
their
amorous
glances
into
their
smoaky
territories
admission
cost
little
there
you
might
see
wits
who
spending
farthings
four
sit
smoke
and
warm
themselves
an
the
allusions
in
the
to
smoking
in
the
are
frequent
sometimes
says
addison
in
his
title
character
in
the
first
number
of
the
paper
sometimes
i
smoak
a
pipe
at
child
and
whilst
i
seem
attentive
to
nothing
but
the
the
conversation
of
every
table
in
the
room
and
here
is
a
vignette
of
life
in
from
no
of
the
i
was
yesterday
in
a
not
far
from
the
royal
exchange
where
i
observed
three
persons
in
close
conference
over
a
pipe
of
tobacco
upon
which
having
filled
one
for
my
own
use
i
lighted
it
at
the
little
wax
candle
that
stood
before
them
and
after
having
thrown
in
two
or
three
whiffs
amongst
them
sat
down
and
made
one
of
the
company
i
need
not
tell
my
reader
that
lighting
a
man
pipe
at
the
same
candle
is
looked
upon
among
as
an
overture
to
conversation
and
friendship
from
the
very
beginning
smoking
has
induced
and
fostered
a
spirit
of
comradeship
sir
roger
de
coverley
as
a
typical
country
squire
was
naturally
a
smoker
he
presented
his
friend
the
spectator
the
silent
gentleman
with
a
made
by
will
wimble
telling
him
that
will
had
been
busy
all
the
early
part
of
the
winter
in
turning
great
quantities
of
them
and
had
made
a
present
of
one
to
every
gentleman
in
the
county
who
had
good
principles
and
smoked
when
sir
roger
was
driving
in
a
he
called
upon
the
coachman
to
stop
and
when
the
man
came
to
the
window
asked
him
if
he
smoked
while
sir
companion
was
wondering
what
this
would
end
in
the
knight
bid
his
jehu
to
stop
by
the
way
at
any
good
tobacconist
and
take
in
a
roll
of
their
best
virginia
and
when
he
visited
squire
near
gray
inn
gate
his
first
act
was
to
call
for
a
clean
pipe
a
paper
of
tobacco
a
dish
of
coffee
a
newspaper
and
a
wax
candle
and
all
the
boys
in
the
ran
to
serve
him
the
wax
candle
was
of
course
a
convenience
in
matchless
days
for
the
paper
of
tobacco
was
the
equivalent
of
what
is
now
vulgarly
called
a
screw
of
tobacco
the
practice
of
selling
tobacco
in
small
paper
packets
was
common
and
moralists
naturally
had
something
to
say
about
the
fate
of
an
work
when
the
leaves
of
his
books
found
their
ultimate
use
as
wrappers
for
the
weed
for
as
no
mortal
author
says
addison
in
the
ordinary
fate
and
vicissitude
of
things
knows
to
what
use
his
works
may
some
time
or
other
be
applied
a
man
may
often
meet
with
very
celebrated
names
in
a
paper
of
tobacco
i
have
lighted
my
pipe
more
than
once
with
the
writings
of
a
prelate
addison
and
steele
smoked
and
so
did
prior
who
seems
to
have
had
a
weakness
at
times
for
low
company
after
spending
an
evening
with
oxford
bolingbroke
pope
and
swift
it
is
recorded
that
he
would
go
and
smoke
a
pipe
and
drink
a
bottle
of
ale
with
a
common
soldier
and
his
wife
in
long
acre
before
he
went
to
bed
some
of
poems
as
thackeray
caustically
remarks
smack
not
a
little
of
the
conversation
of
his
long
acre
friends
pope
for
awhile
attended
the
symposium
at
button
where
addison
was
the
centre
of
the
coterie
he
describes
himself
as
sitting
with
them
till
two
in
the
morning
over
punch
and
burgundy
amid
the
fumes
of
tobacco
but
such
a
way
of
life
did
not
suit
his
sickly
constitution
and
he
soon
withdrew
it
is
not
likely
that
he
smoked
the
attractions
and
the
atmosphere
of
provincial
were
much
the
same
as
those
of
the
london
resorts
a
german
gentleman
who
visited
cambridge
in
july
and
august
remarked
that
in
the
in
that
town
in
the
morning
and
after
in
the
afternoon
you
could
meet
the
chief
professors
and
doctors
who
read
the
papers
over
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
pipe
of
tobacco
one
of
the
learned
doctors
took
the
german
visitor
to
the
weekly
meeting
of
a
music
club
in
one
of
the
colleges
here
were
assembled
bachelors
masters
and
doctors
of
music
of
the
university
no
professionals
were
employed
who
performed
vocal
and
instrumental
music
to
their
mutual
gratification
though
apparently
not
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
visitor
who
records
his
opinion
that
the
music
was
very
poor
it
lasted
he
says
till
there
was
besides
smoking
and
drinking
of
wine
though
we
did
not
do
much
of
either
at
the
reckoning
was
called
for
and
each
person
paid
there
was
clearly
no
prejudice
against
smoking

in

for
the
year

when
it
was
rumoured
in
may
of
that
year
that
a
certain
house
opposite
one
of
the
colleges
was
haunted
strange
noises
being
heard
in
it
several
scholars
of
the
college
said
come
fetch
us
a
good
pitcher
of
ale
and
tobacco
and
pipes
and
sit
up
and
see
this
spirit
the
ale
was
duly
provided
the
pipes
were
lit
and
the
courageous
smokers
spent
the
night
in
the
house
sitting
singing
and
drinking
there
till
morning
but
alas
they
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
smoking
was
still
popular
also
at
oxford
a
in
her
academia
or
the
humours
of
oxford
speaks
indeed
of
undergraduates
who
when
they
could
not
get
tobacco
did
much
as
the
parson
of
thornton
is
reputed
to
have
done
as
already
related
in

ii

condescended
to
smoke

tobacco
in

time
still
maintained
its
hold
over
large
classes
of
the
people
and
was
still
dominant
in
most
places
of
public
resort
but
there
were
signs
of
change
in
various
directions
as
we
have
seen
and
smoking
had
to
a
large
extent
ceased
to
be
fashionable

evelyn
fewer
still
there
is
little
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
the
gallants
of
the
restoration
court
smoked
but
considering
the
foppery
of
their
attire
and
manners
it
seems
almost
certain
that
tobacco
was
not
in
favour
among
them
the
beaux
with
their
full
wigs
they
carried
combs
of
ivory
or
tortoiseshell
in
their
pockets
with
which
they
publicly
combed
their
flowing
locks
their
dandy
canes
and
scented
laced
handkerchiefs
were
not
the
men
to
enjoy
the
flavour
of
tobacco
in
a
pipe
they
were
still
but
they
did
not
smoke
the
indian
weed
retained
its
empire
over
the
men
and
women
of
fashion
by
changing
its
form
the
beaux
were
the
devotees
of
snuff
the
deftly
handled
pinch
pleasantly
titillated
their
nerves
and
the
dexterous
use
of
the
moreover
could
also
serve
the
purposes
of
vanity

displaying
the
beautiful
whiteness
of
the
hand
and
the
splendour
of
the
rings
upon
the
fingers
the
curled
darlings
of
the
late
seventeenth
century
and
the
pretty
fellows
of
queen
anne
time
did
not
forswear
tobacco
but
they
abjured
smoking
was
universal
in
the
fashionable
world
among
both
men
and
women
and
the
development
of
this
habit
made

unfashionable

tobacco
had
entered
on
a
period
destined
to
be
of
long
duration
when
smoking
was
to
a
very
large
extent
under
a
social
ban
was
unfashionable
that
is
to
say
was
not
practised
by
men
of
fashion
and
was
for
the
most
part
regarded
as
low
or
provincial
from
the
time
named
until
well
into
the
reign
of
queen
victoria
the
social
taboo
was
by
no
means
universal
some
of
the
exceptions
will
be
noted
in
these
pages
but
speaking
broadly
the
general
almost
universal
smoking
of
tobacco
which
had
been
characteristic
of
the
earlier
decades
of
the
seventeenth
century
did
not
again
prevail
until
within
living
memory
throughout
the
eighteenth
century
the
use
of
tobacco
for
smoking
was
largely
confined
to
the
middle
and
humbler
classes
of
society
to
smoke
was
characteristic
of
the
cit
of
the
country
squire
of
the
clergy
especially
of
the
country
parsons
and
of
those
of
lower
social
status
but
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
then
as
since
the
dictates
of
fashion
and
the
conventions
of
society
were
little
regarded
by
many
artists

of

the

the
flattery
of
imitation
in
this
respect
as
in

the
of

there

to
show
that

respects

was
to

little

the
freeborn
whig
from
which
it
may
not
unreasonably
be
surmised
that
the

was
a
tory
and
however
little
enthusiasm
there
may
have
been
at
oxford
in
those
days
for
learning
and

there
was
plenty
of
life
in
political
animosities
another
witness
to
the
dons
love
of

is
thomas

in
his
progress
of
discontent
written
in

fond

godley
in
his
oxford
in
the
eighteenth
century
gives
an
excellent
english
version
of
the
latin
original
of
one
of
the
christ
church
carmina
quadragesmalia
which
affords
much
the
same
picture
of
the
daily
life
of
an
oxford
fellow
in
the
days
when
george
i
was
king
this
good
man
lives
strictly
by
rule
and
each
returning
day
swerves
a
hairbreadth
from
the
same
old
way
always
within
the
memory
of
men
he
risen
at
eight
and
gone
to
bed
at
ten
the
same
old
cat
his
college
room
partakes
the
same
old
scout
his
bed
each
morning
makes
on
mutton
roast
he
daily
dines
in
state

perished
to
supply
his
plate

just
one
turn
to
catch
the
westering
sun
then
reads
the
paper
as
he
always
done
soon
cracks
in
the
same
old
jokes
drinking
three
glasses
ere
three
pipes
he
smokes
and
what
he
did
while
charles
our
throne
did
fill
george
heir
you
find
him
doing
it
seems
to
have
been
taken
for
granted
that
country
parsons
smoked
smoking
was
universal
among
their
male
parishioners
from
the
squire
to
the
labourer
when
he
could
afford
it
so
that
it
was
only
natural
that
the
parson
with
little
to
do
and
in
those
days
not
too
much
inclination
to
do
it
should
be
as
fond
of
his
pipe
as
the
rest
of
the
world
around
him
in
a
of
there
is
an
account
of
a
country
gentleman
entertaining
one
evening
the
vicar
of
the
parish
and
the
host
as
a
matter
of
course
proceeds
to
order
a
bottle
of
wine
with
pipes
and
tobacco
to
be
placed
on
the
table
the
vicar
forthwith
filled
his
pipe
and
drank
very
cordially
to
my
friend
his
host
one
can
not
doubt
that
laurence
sterne
that
most
remarkable
of
country
parsons
smoked
his
my
uncle
toby
is
among
the
immortals
and
toby
without
his
pipe
is
unimaginable
the
most
famous
of
country
clergymen
of
the
early
georgian
period
is
of
course
fielding
lovable
and
immortal
parson
adams
throughout
joseph
andrews
the
parson
smokes
at
every
opportunity
at
his
first
appearance
on
the
scene
in
the
inn
kitchen
he
calls
for
a
pipe
of
tobacco
before
taking
his
place
at
the
fireside
the
next
morning
when
he
fails
to
obtain
a
desired
loan
from
the
landlord
adams
extremely
dejected
at
his
disappointment
immediately
applies
to
his
pipe
his
constant
friend
and
comfort
in
his
affliction
and
leans
over
the
rails
of
the
gallery
overlooking
the
devoting
himself
to
meditation
assisted
by
the
inspiring
fumes
of
tobacco
later
on
in
the
parlour
of
the
country
justice
of
the
peace
who
condemned
his
prisoners
before
he
had
taken
the
depositions
of
the
witnesses
against
them
and
who
by
the
way
also
lit
his
pipe
while
his
clerk
performed
this
necessary
duty
adams
when
his
character
has
been
cleared
sits
down
with
the
company
and
takes
a
cheerful
glass
and
applies
himself
vigorously
to
smoking
a
few
hours
later
when
the
parson
fanny
and
their
guide
are
driven
by
a
storm
of
rain
to
take
shelter
in
a
wayside
adams
immediately
procured
himself
a
good
fire
a
toast
and
ale
and
a
pipe
and
began
to
smoke
with
great
content
utterly
forgetting
everything
that
had
happened
in
the
same
inn
after
slipslop
has
appeared
and
disappeared
adams
smokes
three
pipes
and
takes
a
comfortable
nap
in
a
great
chair
so
leaving
the
lovers
joseph
and
fanny
to
enjoy
a
delightful
time
together
at
another
inn
a
country
squire
is
discovered
smoking
his
pipe
by
the
door
and
the
parson
promptly
joins
him
again
he
smokes
before
he
goes
to
bed
and
before
he
breakfasts
the
next
morning
and
when
he
goes
into
the
inn
garden
with
the
host
who
is
willing
to
trust
him
both
host
and
parson
light
their
pipes
before
beginning
to
gossip
farther
on
when
the
hospitable
wilson
takes
the
weary
wayfarers
in
parson
adams
loses
no
time
in
filling
himself
with
ale
as
fielding
puts
it
and
lighting
his
pipe
the
menfolk
wilson
adams
and
joseph
have
to
spend
the
night
seated
round
the
fire
but
apparently
adams
is
the
only
one
who
seeks
the
solace
of
tobacco
it
is
significant
that
wilson
in
telling
the
story
of
his
dissipated
early
life
classes
smoking
with
singing
holloaing
wrangling
drinking
toasting
and
other
diversions
of
jolly
companions
there
is
no
mention
of
parson
trulliber
pipe
but
that
and
lover
can
hardly
have
been
a
both
the
other
clerical
characters
who
appear
in
the
book
the
roman
catholic
priest
who
makes
an
equivocal
appearance
in
the
eighth
chapter
of
the
third
book
and
parson
barnabas
who
thinks
that
his
own
sermons
are
at
least
equal
to
tillotson
smoke
their
pipes
the
other
smokers
in
joseph
andrews
are
the
surgeon
and
the
exciseman
who
early
in
the
story
are
found
sitting
in
the
inn
kitchen
with
parson
barnabas
smoking
their
pipes
over
some
syderand
the
mysterious
cup
being
a
mixture
of
cider
and
something
spirituous
and
joseph
father
old
gaffer
andrews
who
appears
at
the
end
of
the
story
and
complains
bitterly
that
he
wants
his
pipe
not
having
had
a
whiff
that
morning
fielding
himself
smoked
his
pipe
when
his
play
the
wedding
day
was
produced
by
garrick
in
various
suggestions
were
made
to
the
author
as
to
the
excision
of
certain
passages
and
the
modification
of
one
of
the
scenes
garrick
pressed
for
certain
omissions
but
no
damn
them
said
fielding
if
the
scene
is
not
a
good
one
let
them
find
that
out
and
then
according
to
murphy
he
retired
to
the
where
during
the
progress
of
the
play
he
smoked
his
pipe
and
drank
champagne
presently
he
heard
the
sound
of
hissing
and
when
garrick
came
in
and
explained
that
the
audience
had
hissed
the
scene
he
had
wished
to
have
modified
all
fielding
said
was
oh
damn
them
they
found
it
out
have
they
simon
fraser
lord
lovat
the
crafty
old
jacobite
who
took
part
in
the
rising
of
and
who
was
executed
on
tower
hill
in
was
a
smoker
the
pipe
which
he
was
reported
to
have
smoked
on
the
evening
before
his
execution
together
with
his
and
a
canvas
were
for
many
years
in
the
possession
of
the
society
of
cogers
the
famous
debating
society
of
fleet
street
it
has
sometimes
been
said
that
swift
smoked
but
this
is
a
mistake
he
had
a
fancy
for
taking
tobacco
in
a
slightly
different
way
from
the
fashionable
mode
of
taking
snuff
he
told
stella
that
he
had
left
off
snuff
altogether
and
then
in
the
very
next
sentence
remarked
that
he
had
a
noble
roll
of
tobacco
for
grating
very
good
and
in
a
later
letter
to
stella
may
he
asked
if
she
still
snuffed
and
went
on
to
say
in
sentences
that
seem
to
contradict
one
another
i
have
left
it
off
and
when
anybody
offers
me
their
box
i
take
about
a
tenth
part
of
what
i
used
to
do
then
just
smell
to
it
and
privately
fling
the
rest
away
i
keep
to
my
tobacco
still
as
you
say
but
even
much
less
of
that
than
formerly
only
mornings
and
evenings
and
very
seldom
in
the
day
one
might
infer
from
this
that
he
smoked
but
this
swift
never
did
his
practice
was
to
snuff
up
cut
and
dried
tobacco
which
was
sometimes
just
coloured
with
spanish
snuff
this
he
did
all
his
life
but
as
the
mixture
he
took
was
not
technically
snuff
he
never
owned
that
he
took
snuff
another
cleric
of
the
period
well
known
to
fame
who
took
snuff
but
also
loved
his
pipe
was
samuel
wesley
rector
of
epworth
lincolnshire
from
to
he
not
only
smoked
his
pipe
but
sang
its
praises
these
raw
mornings
when
i
freezing
ripe
what
can
compare
with
a
primed
cocked
and
toucht
better
heat
a
man
than
ten
bath
faggots
or
scotch
samuel
greater
son
john
wesley
did
not
share
the
parental
love
of
a
pipe
he
spoke
of
the
use
of
tobacco
as
an
uncleanly
and
unwholesome
and
described
snuffing
as
a
silly
nasty
dirty
custom
the
london
clergy
seem
to
have
smoked
at
one
time
as
a
matter
of
course
at
their
gatherings
at
sion
college
their
headquarters

entry
in
the
records
under

february
relating
to
a

meeting

maddocks
the
messenger
for
attendinge
and
pipes
how
long
pipes
continued
to
be
concomitants
of
the
meetings
of
the
college
general
court
i
can
not
say
but
smoking
and
the
annual
dinners
were
long
associated
at
the
anniversary
feast
in
there
were
two
tables
to
provide
for
the
total
number
of
guests
being
about
thirty
and
two
corses
to
each
the
cost
of
the
food
as
canon
pearce
tells
us
in
his
excellent
and
entertaining
book
on
the
college
and
its
library
was
or
rather
more
than
a
head
the
bill
for
wines
and
tobacco
amounted
to
five
guineas
or
about
a
head
and
for
this
modest
sum
the
thirty
convives
enjoyed
eleven
gallons
of
red
oporto
one
of
white
lisbon
and
three
of
mountain
to
the
accompaniment
of
two
pounds
of
tobacco
at
the
pound
smoked
in
half
a
groce
of
pipes
at
the
examples
and
illustrations
which
have
been
given
so
far
in
this
chapter
relate
to
tradesmen
and
merchants
country
gentlemen
and

other
professional
men

read
in
fielding
amelia
of
a
doctor
who
in
the
evening
smoked
his
as
the
phrase
is
and
among
the
rest
of
the
people
of
equal
or
lower
social
standing
smoking
was
as
generally
practised
as
in
the
preceding
century
handel
i
may
note
enjoyed
his
pipe
burney
when
a
schoolboy
at
chester
was
extremely
curious
to
see
so
extraordinary
a
man
so
when
handel
went
through
that
city
in
on
his
way
to
ireland
young
burney
watched
him
narrowly
as
long
as
he
remained
in
chester
and
among
other
things
had
the
felicity
of
seeing
the
great
man
smoke
a
pipe
over
a
dish
of
coffee
at
the
exchange
which
was
under
the
old
town
hall
that
stood
opposite
the
present
king
school
and
in
front
of
the
present
town
hall
gonzales
in
his
voyage
to
great
britain
says
that
the
use
of
tobacco
was
very
universal
and
indeed
not
improper
for
so
moist
a
climate
he
tells
us
that
though
the
taverns
were
very
numerous
yet
the
were
much
more
so
these
were
visited
by
the
inferior
tradesmen
mechanics
journeymen
porters
coachmen
carmen
servants
and
others
whose
pockets
were
not
equal
to
the
price
of
a
glass
of
wine
which
apparently
was
the
more
usual
thing
to
call
for
at
a
tavern
properly
so
called
in
the
men
of
the
various
classes
and
occupations
enumerated
says
the
traveller
would
sit
promiscuously
in
common
dirty
rooms
with
large
fires
and
clouds
of
tobacco
where
one
that
is
not
used
to
them
can
scarce
breathe
or
see
the
antiquary
hearne
has
left
on
record
an
account
of
a
curious
smoking
match
held
at
oxford
in
it
began
at
two
in
the
afternoon
of
september
on
a
scaffold
specially
erected
for
the
purpose
over
against
the
theatre
in
oxford
just
at
finmore
an
alehouse
the
conditions
were
that
any
one
man
or
woman
who
could
smoke
out
three
ounces
of
tobacco
first
without
drinking
or
going
off
the
stage
should
have
many
tryed
continues
hearne
and
thought
that
a
journeyman
taylour
of
peter
in
the
east
would
have
been
victor
he
smoking
faster
than
and
being
many
pipes
before
the
rest
but
at
last
he
was
so
sick
that
was
thought
he
would
have
dyed
and
an
old
man
that
had
been
a
souldier
and
smoaked
gently
came
off
conqueror
smoaking
the
three
ounces
quite
out
and
he
told
one
from
whom
i
had
it
that
after
it
he
smoaked
or
pipes
the
same
evening
the
old
soldier
was
a
veteran
another
foreign
visitor
to
england
the
abbé
le
blanc
who
was
over
here
about
found
english
customs
rather
trying
even
at
table
he
says
where
they
serve
desserts
they
do
but
show
them
and
presently
take
away
everything
even
to
the
tablecloth
by
this
the
english
whom
politeness
does
not
permit
to
tell
the
ladies
their
company
is
troublesome
give
them
notice
to
retire
the
table
is
immediately
covered
with
mugs
bottles
and
glasses
and
often
with
pipes
of
tobacco
all
things
thus
disposed
the
ceremony
of
toasts
begins
the
frowns
and
remonstrances
of
quarterly
and
monthly
meetings
of
friends
had
not
succeeded
in
putting
the
quakers
pipes
out
in
a
list
of
sea
stores
put
on
board
a
vessel
called
by
the
name
of
charming
which
brought
a
party
of
friends
across
the
atlantic
from
philadelphia
in
we
find
in
samuel
new
chest
tobacco
a
hamper
a
barrel
a
box
of
pipes
the
provident
samuel
was
well
found
for
a
long
voyage
the
were
the
men
of
fashion
and
those
who
followed
them
in
preferring
the
to
the
pipe
sometimes
apparently
they
chewed
a
of
pokes
fun
at
the
pretty
young
men
who
take
pains
to
appear
manly
but
alas
the
methods
they
pursue
like
most
mistaken
applications
rather
aggravate
the
calamity
their
drinking
and
raking
only
makes
them
look
like
old
maids
their
swearing
is
almost
as
shocking
as
it
would
be
in
the
other
sex
their
chewing
tobacco
not
only
offends
but
makes
us
apprehensive
at
the
same
time
that
the
poor
things
will
be
sick
as
they
certainly
well
deserved
to
be
to
chew
might
be
manly
but
it
will
be
observed
that
smoking
is
not
mentioned
no
reputation
for
manliness
could
be
achieved
by
even
the
affectation
of
a
pipe
similarly
in
man
of
taste
various
fashionable
tastes
are
described

there
is

if
they

crowds
remain
who
still
its
worth
proclaim
while
some
for
pleasure
smoke
and
some
for
the
satirist
wrote
truly
that
after
all
the
fashionable
abstainers
had
been
deducted
crowds
remained
who
smoked
as
heartily
as
their
predecessors
of
a
century
earlier
the
populace
was
still
on
the
side
of
tobacco
this
was
well
shown
in
when
sir
robert
walpole
proposed
special
excise
duties
on
tobacco
and
brought
a
bill
into
parliament
which
would
have
given
his
excisemen
powers
of
inquisition
which
were
much
resented
by
the
people
generally
the
controversy
produced
a
host
of
squibs
and
caricatures
most
of
which
were
directed
against
the
measure
the
bill
was
defeated
in
and
great
and
general
were
the
rejoicings
when
the
news
reached
derby
on
april
in
that
year
the
dealers
in
tobacco
caused
all
the
bells
in
the
derby
churches
to
be
rung
and
we
may
be
sure
that
this
rather
unusual
performance
was
highly
popular
the
withdrawal
of
the
odious
duty
was
further
celebrated
by
caricatures
and
poetical
chants
of
triumph
one
of
the
leading
opponents
of
the
bill
had
been
a
puffing
tobacconist
named
bradley
who
was
accustomed
to
describe
his
wares
as
the
best
in
christendom
and
when
the
bill
was
defeated
portrait
was
published
for
popular
circulation
above
these
lines

man
who
when
a
gloomy
band
of
vile
excisemen
threatened
all
the

to
deliver

william
cowper
from
a
letter
to
the
rev
john
newton
may
smoking
has
gone
out
said
johnson
in
talk
at
andrews
one
day
in
to
be
sure
he
continued
it
is
a
shocking
thing
blowing
smoke
out
of
our
mouths
into
other
people
mouths
eyes
and
noses
and
having
the
same
thing
done
to
us
yet
i
can
not
account
why
a
thing
which
requires
so
little
exertion
and
yet
preserves
the
mind
from
total
vacuity
should
have
gone
out
johnson
did
not
trouble
himself
to
think
of
how
much
the
vagaries
of
fashion
account
for
stranger
vicissitudes
in
manners
and
customs
than
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
nor
did
he
probably
foresee
how
slowly
but
surely
the
taste
for
smoking
even
in
the
circles
most
influenced
by
fashion
would
revive
boswell
tells
us
that
although
the
sage
himself
never
smoked
yet
he
had
a
high
opinion
of
the
practice
as
a
sedative
influence
and
hawkins
heard
him
say
on
one
occasion
that
insanity
had
grown
more
frequent
since
smoking
had
gone
out
of
fashion
which
shows
that
even
johnson
could
fall
a
victim
to
the
hoc
propter
fallacy
more
than
one
writer
of
recent
days
has
absurdly
misrepresented
johnson
as
a
smoker
the
author
of
a
book
on
tobacco
published
a
few
years
ago
wrote
johnson
smoked
like
a
furnace
a
grotesquely
untrue
statement
and
all
his
friends
goldsmith
reynolds
garrick
were
his
companions
in
reynolds
we
know
they
talk
of
their
raphaels
corregios
and
stuff
he
shifted
his
trumpet
and
only
took
johnson
and
all
his
company
took
snuff
as
every
one
in
the
fashionable
world
and
a
great
many
others
outside
that
charmed
circle
did
but
johnson
did
not
smoke
and
i
doubt
whether
any
of
the
others
did
there
is
ample
evidence
apart
from
johnson
dictum
that
in
the
latter
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
smoking
had
gone
out
in
climenson
passages
from
the
diaries
of
lybbe
powys
we
hear
of
a
bundle
of
papers
at
hardwick
house
near
whitchurch
oxon
which
bears
the
unvarnished
title
dick
debts
this
dick
was
a
captain
richard
powys
who
had
a
commission
in
the
guards
and
died
at
the
early
age
of
in
the
year
this
list
of
debts
it
appears
gives
the
most
complete
catalogue
of
the
expenses
of
a
dandy
of
the
court
of
george
ii
consisting
chiefly
of
swords
buckles
lace
valenciennes
and
point
gold
and
canes
tavern
bills
and
chair
hire
but
in
all
the
ample
detail
of
captain
powys
list
of
extravagances
there
is
nothing
directly
or
indirectly
relating
to
smoking
the
beaux
of
the
time
did
not
smoke
in
the
whole
sixteen
volumes
of
walpole
correspondence
as
so
admirably
edited
by
toynbee
there
is
scarcely
a
mention
of
tobacco
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
other
collections
of
letters
of
the
same
period
the
selwyn
letters
the
delany
correspondence
and
so
on
neither
walpole
nor
any
member
of
the
world
in
which
he
lived
would
appear
to
have
smoked
in
miss
burney
evelina
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
book
there
is
no
mention
whatever
of
tobacco
or
of
smoking
apparently
the
vulgar
branghtons
were
not
vulgar
enough
to
smoke
such
use
of
tobacco
was
considered
low
and
was
confined
to
the
classes
of
society
indicated
in
the
preceding
chapter
one
of
the
characters
in
macklin
love
à

is
described
as

goes
to

but
his

contains
no
reference

rowlandson
himself
smoked
and
so
did
his
brother
caricaturist
gillray
angelo
says
that
they
would
sometimes
meet
at
such
resorts
of
the
low
as
the
bell
the
coal
hole
or
the
coach
and
horses
and
would
enter
into
the
common
chat
of
the
room
smoke
and
drink
together
and
then
sometimes
early
sometimes
late
shake
hands
at
the
door
look
up
at
the
stars
say
it
is
a
pretty
night
and
depart
one
for
the
adelphi
the
other
to
james
street
each
to
his
bachelor
bed
but
outside
the
fashionable
world
pipes
were
still
in
full
blast
and
in
many
places
of
resort
the
atmosphere
was
as
beclouded
with
as
in
earlier
days
grosley
in
his
tour
to
london
says
that
there
were
regular
clubs
which
were
held
in
and
taverns
at
fixed
days
and
hours
when
wine
beer
tea
pipes
and
tobacco
helped
to
amuse
the
company
angelo
gives
some
lively
pictures
of
scenes
of
this
kind
in
the
london
of
about
the
turk
head
in
gerrard
street
was
the
for
a
knot
of
worthies
principally
of
luke
or
the
children
of
thespis
and
mostly
votaries
of
bacchus
as
the
old
who
loved
a
little
fine
writing
describes
them
and
here
they
sat
he
says
taking
their
punch
and
smoking
the
prevailing
custom
of
the
time
about
the
same
time
an
evening
resort
for
purposes
mostly
vicious
was
the
famous
dog
and
duck
in
george
fields
the
long
room
says
angelo
if
i
may
depend
on
my
memory
was
on
the
ground
floor
and
all
the
benches
were
filled
with
motley
groups
eating
drinking
and
smoking
angelo
also
mentions
the
picnic
society
a
celebrated
resort
of
fashion
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
where
the
odour
of
tobacco
never
penetrated
it
afforded
he
says
in
his
fine
way
a
sort
of
antipodeal
contrast
to
these
smoking
tavern
clubs
of
the
old
city
of
trinobantes
the
same
writer
speaks
of
a
certain
monsieur
liviez
whom
he
met
in
paris
in
who
had
been
one
of
the
first
dancers
at
the
italian
opera
house
and
de
at
drury
lane
theatre
this
gentleman
was
addicted
to
loved
good
eating
and
good
and
ample
drinking
and
moreover
kept
late
hours
smoked
his
pipe
and
drank
oceans
of
punch
coleridge
in
the
biographia
literaria
gives
an
amusing
account
of
his
own
experience
of
an
attempt
to
smoke
in
company
with
a
party
of
tradesmen
in
he
was
travelling
about
the
country
endeavouring
to
secure
subscriptions
to
the
periodical
publication
he
had
started
called
at
birmingham
one
day
he
dined
with
a
worthy
tradesman
who
after
dinner
importuned
him
to
smoke
a
pipe
with
him
and
two
or
three
other
of
the
same
rank
the
remainder
of
the
moving
story
must
be
told
in
coleridge
own
words
i
objected
he
says
both
because
i
was
engaged
to
spend
the
evening
with
a
minister
and
his
friends
and
because
i
had
never
smoked
except
once
or
twice
in
my
and
then
it
was
herb
tobacco
mixed
with
oronooko
on
the
assurance
however
that
the
tobacco
was
equally
mild
and
seeing
too
that
it
was
of
a
yellow
colour
not
forgetting
the
lamentable
difficulty
i
have
always
experienced
in
saying
and
in
abstaining
from
what
the
people
about
me
were
doing
i
took
half
a
pipe
filling
the
lower
half
of
the
bole
with
salt
i
was
soon
however
compelled
to
resign
it
in
consequence
of
a
giddiness
and
distressful
feeling
in
my
eyes
which
as
i
had
drunk
but
a
single
glass
of
ale
must
i
knew
have
been
the
effect
of
the
tobacco
soon
after
deeming
myself
recovered
i
sallied
forth
to
my
engagement
but
the
walk
and
the
fresh
air
brought
on
all
the
symptoms
again
and
i
had
scarcely
entered
the
and
opened
a
small
pacquet
of
letters
which
he
had
received
from
bristol
for
me
ere
i
sank
back
on
the
sofa
in
a
sort
of
swoon
rather
than
sleep
fortunately
i
had
found
just
time
enough
to
inform
him
of
the
confused
state
of
my
feelings
and
of
the
occasion
for
here
and
thus
i
lay
my
face
like
a
wall
that
is
deathly
pale
and
with
the
cold
drops
of
perspiration
running
down
it
from
my
forehead
while
one
after
another
there
dropped
in
the
different
gentlemen
who
had
been
invited
to
meet
and
spend
the
evening
with
me
to
the
number
of
from
fifteen
to
twenty
as
the
poison
of
tobacco
acts
but
for
a
short
time
i
at
length
awoke
from
insensibility
and
looked
round
on
the
party
my
eyes
dazzled
by
the
candles
which
had
been
lighted
in
the
interim
by
way
of
relieving
my
embarrassment
one
of
the
gentlemen
began
the
conversation
with
you
seen
a
paper
mr
coleridge
i
replied
rubbing
my
eyes
am
far
from
convinced
that
a
christian
is
permitted
to
read
either
newspapers
or
any
other
works
of
merely
political
and
temporary
interest
this
remark
so
ludicrously
inapposite
to
or
rather
incongruous
with
the
purpose
for
which
i
was
known
to
have
visited
birmingham
and
to
assist
me
in
which
they
were
all
met
produced
an
involuntary
and
general
burst
of
laughter
and
seldom
indeed
have
i
passed
so
many
delightful
hours
as
i
enjoyed
in
that
room
from
the
moment
of
that
laugh
till
an
early
hour
the
next
morning
all
well
that
ends
well
but
one
can
not
help
wondering
what
kind
of
tobacco
it
was
that
the
birmingham
tradesman
used
a
half
pipeful
of
which
had
such
a
deadly
effect
but
perhaps
the
effect
was
due
to
the
salt
not
to
the
tobacco
in
the
year
after
that
which
witnessed
coleridge
adventure
in
a
with
a
history
was
the
subject
of
a
legal
decision
this
box
made
of
common
horn
and
small
enough
to
be
carried
in
the
pocket
was
bought
for
fourpence
by
an
overseer
of
the
poor
in
the
time
of
queen
anne
and
was
presented
by
him
in
to
the
society
of
past
overseers
of
the
parish
of
margaret
westminster
in
the
society
in
memory
of
the
donor
ornamented
the
lid
with
a
silver
rim
and
at
intervals
thereafter
additions
were
made
to
an
extraordinary
extent
to
the
box
and
its
casings
hogarth
engraved
within
the
lid
in
a
bust
of
the
victor
of
culloden
gradually
the
horn
box
was
enshrined
within
one
case
after
another
usually
silver
lined
with
velvet
each
case
bearing
inscribed
plates
commemorating
persons
or
events
a
past
overseer
who
detained
the
box
in
had
to
give
it
back
after
three
years
of
litigation
a
case
of
octagon
shape
records
the
triumph
of
justice
and
lord
chancellor
loughborough
pronouncing
his
decree
for
the
restitution
of
the
box
on
march
in
later
days
many
and
various
additions
have
been
made
to
the
many
coverings
of
the
box
recording
public
events
of
interest
notwithstanding
the
unfashionableness
of
tobacco
there
were
still
some
noteworthy
smokers
to
be
found
among
the
clergy
sumner
head
master
of
harrow
who
died
in
was
devoted
to
his
pipe
the
greatest
of
clerical
tobacconists
of
late
eighteenth
century
and
early
nineteenth
century
date
was
the
once
famous
parr
it
was
from
him
that
sumner
learned
to
smoke
when
he
and
parr
got
together
sumner
was
in
the
habit
of
refilling
his
pipe
again
and
again
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
unobserved
at
the
same
time
begging
parr
not
to
depart
till
he
had
finished
his
pipe
in
order
that
he
might
detain
him
we
are
told
in
the
evening
as
long
as
possible
parr
was
not
a
model
smoker
he
was
brutally
overbearing
towards
other
folk
and
would
accept
no
invitation
except
on
the
understanding
that
he
might
smoke
when
and
where
he
liked
it
was
his
invariable
practice
wherever
he
might
be
visiting
to
smoke
a
pipe
as
soon
as
he
had
got
out
of
bed
his
biographer
says
the
ladies
were
obliged
to
bear
his
tobacco
or
to
give
up
his
company
and
at
hatton
now
and
then
he
was
the
tyrant
of
the
fireside
parr
was
capable
of
smoking
twenty
pipes
in
an
evening
and
described
himself
as
rolling
volcanic
fumes
of
tobacco
to
the
ceiling
while
he
worked
at
his
desk
at
a
dinner
which
was
given
at
trinity
college
cambridge
to
the
duke
of
gloucester
as
chancellor
of
the
university
when
the
cloth
was
removed
parr
at
once
started
his
pipe
and
began
says
one
who
was
present
blowing
a
cloud
into
the
faces
of
his
neighbours
much
to
their
annoyance
and
causing
royalty
to
sneeze
by
the
stimulating
stench
of
mundungus
it
is
surprising
that
people
were
willing
to
put
up
with
such
bad
manners
as
parr
was
accustomed
to
exhibit
but
his
reputation
was
then
great
and
he
traded
upon
it
parr
is
said
on
one
occasion
to
have
called
for
a
pipe
after
taking
a
meal
at
a
called
the
bush
at
bristol
when
the
waiter
told
him
that
smoking
was
not
allowed
at
the
bush
parr
persisted
but
the
authorities
at
the
inn
were
firm
in
their
refusal
to
allow
anything
so
vulgar
as
smoking
on
their
premises
whereupon
parr
is
said
to
have
exclaimed
why
man
i
smoked
in
the
of
every
nobleman
in
england
the
duchess
of
devonshire
said
i
could
smoke
in
every
room
in
her
house
but
her
and
here
in
this
dirty
of
bristol
you
forbid
smoking
amazing
bring
me
my
bill
the
learned
doctor
exaggerated
no
doubt
as
regards
the
facilities
given
him
for
smoking
for
it
was
his
overbearing
way
not
to
ask
for
leave
to
smoke
but
to
smoke
wherever
he
went
whether
invited
to
do
so
or
not
but
the
story
shows
the
prejudice
against
smoking
which
was
found
in
many
places
as
a
result
of
the
attitude
of
the
fashionable
world
towards
tobacco
johnstone
parr
biographer
referring
to
his
hero
failure
to
obtain
preferment
to
the
episcopal
bench
about
the
year
says
his
pipe
might
be
deemed
in
these
fantastic
days
a
degradation
at
the
table
of
the
palace
or
the
castle
but
his
noble
hospitality
combined
with
his
habits
of
sobriety
whether
tobacco
fumigated
his
table
or
not
would
have
filled
his
hall
with
the
learned
and
the
good
a
portrait
of
parr
hangs
in
the
combination
room
in
john
cambridge
originally
it
represented
him
faithfully
with
a
long
clay
between
hand
and
mouth
but
for
some
unknown
reason
the
pipe
has
been
painted
out
a
famous
crony
of
parr
the
learned
porson
was
another
devotee
of
tobacco
in
november
parr
wrote
to
burney
the
books
may
be
consulted
and
porson
shall
do
it
and
he
will
do
it
i
know
his
price
when
he
bargains
with
me
two
bottles
instead
of
one
six
pipes
instead
of
two
burgundy
instead
of
claret
liberty
to
sit
till
five
in
the
morning
instead
of
sneaking
into
bed
at
one
these
are
his
terms
and
these
few
lines
it
may
be
added
give
a
graphic
picture
of
porson
according
to
maltby
porson
once
remarked
that
when
smoking
began
to
go
out
of
fashion
learning
began
to
go
out
of
fashion
also
which
shows
what
nonsense
a
learned
man
could
talk
another
famous
parson
the
rev
john
newton
was
a
smoker
and
so
was
cowper
other
clerical
friend
that
learned
and
able
dissenter
the
rev
william
bull
whose
whole
mien
and
bearing
were
so
dignified
that
on
two
occasions
he
was
mistaken
for
a
bishop
cowper
appreciated
snuff
but
did
not
care
for
smoking
and
when
he
wrote
to
unwin
describing
his
friend
in
terms
of
admiration
he
concluded
such
a
man
is
bull
but
he
smokes
tobacco
nothing
is
perfection
est
ab
omni
parte
beatum
bull
however
was
not
excessive
in
his
smoking
for
his
daily
allowance
was
but
three
pipes
in
his
garden
at
newport
pagnell
bull
showed
cowper
a
nook
in
which
he
had
placed
a
bench
where
he
said
he
found
it
very
refreshing
to
smoke
his
pipe
and
meditate
here
he
sits
wrote
cowper
with
his
back
against
one
brick
wall
and
his
nose
against
another
which
must
you
know
be
very
refreshing
and
greatly
assist
meditation
cowper
aversion
from
tobacco
could
not
have
been
very
strong
for
he
encouraged
his
friend
to
smoke
in
the
famous
summer
house
at
olney
which
was
the
poet
outdoor
study
bull
smoked
orinoco
tobacco
which
he
carried
in
one
of
the
which
in
those
days
were
much
more
commonly
used
than
pouches
and
this
box
on
one
occasion
he
accidentally
left
behind
him
at
olney
cowper
returned
it
to
him
with
the
rhymed
epistle
dated
june
and
beginning
reading
verse
be
your
delight
is
mine
as
much
or
more
to
write
but
what
we
would
so
weak
is
man
lies
oft
remote
from
what
we
he
describes
the
box
and
its
contents
in
lines
which
show
not
only
tolerance
but
appreciation
of
tobacco
from
which
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
infer
that
cowper
first
view
of
his
as
a
drawback
as
shown
in
his
letter
to
unwin
quoted
above
had
been
modified
by
neighbourhood
and
custom
it
might
have
been
well
for
the
poet
himself
if
he
had
learned
to
smoke
a
social
pipe
with
his
friend
bull
the
appreciative
lines
run
thus

verses
to

wipe
refers
to
a
passage
in
the
poem
entitled
conversation
which
cowper
had
written
in
the
previous
year
in
this
passage
tobacco
is
abused
in
terms
which
cowper
clearly
felt
to
need
modification
after
his
personal
intercourse
with
such
a
smoker
as
his
friend
bull
in
describing
in
conversation
the
manner
in
which
a
story
is
sometimes
told
the
poet
says

solemn
interposing

a
time
enough
the
dozing

again
such
often
like

so
admire
important
triflers
have
more
smoke
than
cowper
then
goes
on
to
attack
tobacco
in
lines
which
show
how
unpopular
smoking
at
that
date
was
with
ladies
and
which
have
since
often
been
quoted
by
with
grateful
appreciation

to
poison
vermin
that
infest
his
plants
but
are
we
so
to
wit
and
beauty
blind
as
to
despise
the
glory
of
our
kind
and
show
the
softest
minds
and
fairest
forms
as
little
mercy
as
the
grubs
and
worms
notwithstanding
this
satiric
wipe
it
is
not
likely
that
cowper
would
have
had
much
sympathy
with
john
wesley
who
in
his
detestation
of
what
had
been
his
father
solace
at
epworth
forbade
his
preachers
either
to
smoke
or
to
take
snuff
in
the
first
two
or
three
decades
of
the
nineteenth
century
smoking
reached
its
nadir
no
dandy
smoked
if
some
witnesses
may
be
believed
smoking
had
almost
died
out
even
at
oxford
archdeacon
denison
wrote
in
his
memories
when
i
went
up
to
oxford
there
were
two
things
unknown
in
christ
church
and
i
believe
very
generally
in
oxford
smoking
and
slang
but
one
can
not
help
fancying
that
the
archdeacon
memory
was
not
quite
trustworthy
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
that
there
was
ever
a
time
when
the
slang
of
the
day
was
not
current
on
the
lips
of
young
oxford
or
that
so
long
as
tobacco
was
procurable
it
did
not
find
its
way
into
college
rooms
if
smoking
had
died
out
at
oxford
its
decline
must
have
been
rapid
when
a
certain
young
john
james
was
an
undergraduate
of
queen
to
he
and
his
correspondents
spoke
severely
of
the
miserable
condition
of
fellows
who
under
the
liberal
pretence
of
educating
youth
spend
half
their
lives
in
smoking
tobacco
and
reading
the
newspapers
about
the
older
or
more
of
the
fellows
at
new
college
not
liking
the
then
newly
introduced
luxury
of
turkey
carpets
says
cox
in
his
recollections
of
oxford
often
adjourned
to
smoke
their
pipe
in
a
little
room
opposite
to
the
senior
now
appropriated
to
other
uses
but
then
kept
as
a
a
rhodes
a
fellow
of
worcester
college
who
was
elected
esquire
bedel
in
medicine
and
arts
in
had
a
very
peculiar
way
of
enjoying
his
tobacco
cox
says
on
one
occasion
when
i
had
to
call
upon
him
i
found
him
drinking
rum
and
water
and
enjoying
what
he
called
his
luxury
the
fumes
of
tobacco
not
through
a
pipe
or
in
the
shape
of
a
cigar
but
in
a
dish
smoking
had
certainly
not
died
out
at
cambridge
even
at
the
time
when
denison
was
at
oxford
according
to
the
gradus
ad
cantabrigium
the
cambridge
smart
man
habit
was
to
dine
in
the
evening
at
his
own
rooms
or
at
those
of
a
friend
and
afterwards
blows
a
cloud
puffs
at
a
segar
and
drinks
copiously
the
spelling
of
segar
shows
that
cigars
were
then
somewhat
of
a
novelty
when
tennyson
was
an
undergraduate
at
cambridge
he
and
his
companions
all
smoked
at
the
meetings
of
the
apostles
the
little
group
of
friends
which
included
the
future
laureate
much
coffee
was
drunk
much
tobacco
smoked
dons
smoked
as
well
as
undergraduates
at
queens
the
in
tennyson
time
had
still
a
sanded
floor
and
the
table
was
set
handsomely
forth
with
long
as
the
poet
told
palgrave
when
the

visited
cambridge
in
george
pryme
in
his
autobiographic
recollections
states
that
in
smoking
was
allowed
in
the
trinity
after
supper
in
the
twelve
days
of
christmas
when
a
few
old
men
availed
themselves
of
it
which
looks
as
if
tobacco
were
not
very
popular
just
then
at
trinity
with
the
wine
pipes
and
the
large
silver
were
laid
on
the

had
its
ups

downs
at
the

from
the
set

the
main
current

we

from
the
invaluable
gunning

at

about

was
going
out
of

among

i

a
custom
which
of
course
you
have
learnt
and
will
be
able
to
keep
me
in
countenance
but
no
dandies
or
young
men
of
fashion
smoked
tobacco
save
in
the
disguise
of
snuff
was
tabooed
smoking
was
frowned
upon
even
in
places
where
hitherto
it
had
been
allowed
in

authorities
of

college
ordered
that
coffee

be

in

after

on
that

the
use
of
tobacco
for
smoking
as
i
have
said
had
reached
its
nadir
in
the
fashionable
world
that
is
to
say
but
the
dawn
follows
the
darkest
hour
and
the
revival
of
smoking
was
at
hand
thanks
to
the
cigar
ix
signs
of
revival
some
sigh
for
this
and
that
my
wishes
do
go
far
the
world
may
wag
at
will
so
i
have
my
cigar
thomas
hood
the
revival
of
smoking
among
those
who
were
most
amenable
to
the
dictates
of
fashion
and
among
whom
consequently
tobacco
had
long
been
in
bad
odour
came
by
way
of
the
cigar
in
the
preceding
chapters
all
the
references
to
and
illustrations
of
smoking
have
been
concerned
with
pipes
until
the
early
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
use
of
cigars
was
practically
unknown
in
this
country
the
earliest
notices
of
cigars
in
english
books
occur
in
accounts
of
travel
in
spain
and
portugal
and
in
the
spanish
colonies
and
in
such
notices
the
phonetic
spelling
of
segar
often
occurs
a
few
folk
still
cling
to
this
spelling
there
was
a
in
the
strand
till
quite
recently
and
i
saw
the
notice
segars
the
other
day
over
a
small
in
york
which
has
no
authority
and
on
etymological
grounds
is
indefensible
the
derivation
of
cigar
is
not
altogether
clear
but
the
probabilities
are
strongly
in
favour
of
its
connexion
with
cigarra
the
spanish
name
for
the
cicada
the
insect
familiar
in
the
southern
countries
of
europe
and
the
subject
of
frequent
allusions
by
the
ancient
writers
of
greece
and
rome
as
well
as
by
modern
scribes
a
spanish
lexicographer
of
authority
says
that
the
cigar
has
the
form
of
a
cicada
of
paper
and
on
the
whole
it
is
highly
probable
that
the
likeness
of
the
roll
of
to
the
cylindrical
body
of
the
insect
was
the
reason
that
the
cigarro
was
so
called
there
is
no
warrant
of
any
kind
for
segar
the
earliest
mention
of
cigars
in
english
occurs
in
a
book
dated
a
traveller
in
spanish
america
named
cockburn
whose
narrative
was
published
in
that
year
describes
how
he
met
three
friars
at
nicaragua
who
he
says
gave
us
some
seegars
to
smoke
these
are
leaves
of
tobacco
rolled
up
in
such
manner
that
they
serve
both
for
a
pipe
and
tobacco
itself
they
know
no
other
way
here
for
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
throughout
new
spain
cheroots
seem
to
have
been
known
somewhat
earlier
the
earliest
mention
of
them
is
dated
about
sir
james
murray
in
the
great
oxford

the

the
condemnation
of
as
a
mean
method
of
taking
tobacco
has
an
odd
look
in
the
light
of
modern
habits
and
customs
the
use
of
cigars
in
this
country
began
to
come
in
early
in
the
last
century
and
by
at
least
they
were
being
freely
if
privately
smoked
it
is
probable
that
the
reduction
of
the
duty
on
cigars
from
to
a
in
had
its
effect
in
making
cigars
more
popular
croker
in
commenting
on
johnson
saying
that
smoking
had
gone
out
said
the
taste
for
smoking
however
has
revived
probably
from
the
military
habits
of
europe
during
the
french
wars
but
instead
of
the
sober
sedentary
pipe
the
ambulatory
cigar
is
chiefly
used
croker
shrewd
suggestion
was
probably
not
far
wide
of
the
truth
it
is
quite
likely
if
not
highly
probable
that
the
revival
of
smoking
in
the
shape
of
the
cigar
was
directly
connected
with
the
experiences
of
british
officers
in
spain
and
portugal
during
the
peninsular
war
one
of
the
earliest
must
have
been
that
remarkable
clergyman

have

under

where
he
said
the

even
was

few

sir
walter
scott
often
smoked
cigars
though
he
seems
to
have
regarded
it
in
the
light
of
an
indulgence
to
be
for
in
his
journal
july
he
noted
when
i
had
finished
my
bit
of
dinner
and
was
in
a
quiet
way
smoking
my
cigar
over
a
glass
of

comes
with
a
summons
to

him
to

where
it
seems
i
was
engaged
i
was
totally
out
of
case
to
attend
his
summons
redolent
as
i
was
of
tobacco
but
i
am
vexed
at
the
circumstance
it
looks
careless
and
what
is
worse
affected
and
the
justice
is
an
old
friend
moreover
tobacco
in
any
form
was
suspect
a
man
might
smoke
a
cigar
but
he
must
not
take
the
odour
into
the
of
even
an
old
friend
a
few
years
earlier
in
november
scott
had
written
in
his
journal
that
after
dinner
he
usually
smoked
a
couple
of
cigars
which
operated
as
a
sedative
to
drive
the
cold
winter
away
and
drown
the
fatigues
of
the
i
smoked
a
good
deal
he
continued
about
twenty
years
ago
when
at
ashestiel
but
coming
down
one
morning
to
the
parlour
i
found
as
the
room
was
small
and
confined
that
the
smell
was
unpleasant
and
laid
aside
the
use
of
the
for
many
years
but
was
again
led
to
use
it
by
the
example
of
my
son
a
hussar
officer
and
my
an
oxford
student
i
could
lay
it
aside
i
laugh
at
the
dominion
of
custom
in
this
and
many
things
make
the
giants
first
and
do
not

student

in

that
smoking
was
very
generally
unknown
in

in

a
very
untrustworthy
recorder
scott
remark
was
that
of

to

a

on

the
lines
are
indeed
almost
the
only

in

which
from

cheers
the

admire

give

a
cigar
how
far
these
lines
really
represent
the
poet
own
sentiments
and
whether
he
habitually
smoked
either
cigar
or
pipe
is
another
matter
other
men
of
letters
of
the
time
were
zealous
adherents
of
the
pipe
one
of
these
was
the
poet
campbell
from
to
he
was
editor
of
the
monthly
and
is
reputed
to
have
been
so
very
unbusinesslike
in
his
methods
that
there
was
always
difficulty
in
getting
proofs
corrected
and
returned
in
good
time
on
one
occasion
as
reported
by
a
member
of
the
firm
that
printed
the
magazine
a
proof
had
been
lost
and
the
poet
was
informed
that
the
article
must
go
to
press
next
day
uncorrected
campbell
sent
word
that
he
would
look
in
in
the
morning
and
correct
it
preparations
were
duly
made
to
receive
him
he
was
shown
into
the
best
room
and
left
with
the
proof
on
his
table
after
a
while
he
rang
the
bell
and
said
i
could
do
this
much
better
if
i
had
a
pipe
thereupon
pipe
and
tobacco
were
procured
and
taken
in
to
him
campbell
tore
open
the
paper
containing
the
tobacco
and
with
a
slightly
contemptuous
expression
exclaimed
ugh
i
rather
it
had
been
shag
charles
lamb
was
a
heavy
he
smoked
too
much
regretted
it
but
continued
to
smoke
not
wisely
but
too
well
he
came
home
very
smoky
and
drinky
last
night
says
his
sister
of
him
when
sending
some
books
to
coleridge
at
keswick
in
november
lamb
wrote
if
you
find
the
miltons
in
certain
parts
dirtied
and
soiled
with
a
crumb
of
right
gloucester
blacked
in
the
candle
my
usual
supper
or
peradventure
a
stray
ash
of
tobacco
wafted
into
the
crevices
look
to
that
passage
more
especially
depend
upon
it
it
contains
good
matter
to
lamb
a
book
read
best
over
a
pipe
the
following
year
he
wrote
to
coleridge
what
do
you
think
of
smoking
i
want
your
sober
noon
of
it
i
generally
am
eating
my
dinner
about
the
time
i
should
determine
it
morning
is
a
girl
and
ca
smoke
she
no
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
and
night
is
so
evidently
he
ca
be
a
very
upright
judge
maybe
the
truth
is
that
pipe
is
wholesome
pipes
toothsome
pipes
noisome
pipes
fulsome
pipes
quarrelsome
and
that
the
o
but
that
is
deciding
rather
upon
rhyme
than
reason
after
all
our
instincts
may
be
best
it
is
clear
from
one
or
two
references
that
lamb
and
coleridge
had
been
accustomed
to
smoke
together
at
their
meetings
in
early
days
at
the
salutation
and
cat
with
less
disastrous
results
to
coleridge
it
is
to
be
hoped
than
those
which
followed
his
birmingham
smoke
as
set
forth
in
the
preceding
chapter
in
lamb
wrote
to
wordsworth
now
i
have
bid
farewell
to
my
enemy
tobacco
i
shall
perhaps
set
nobly
to
work
forthwith
he
set
to
work
on
the
farce
which
some
months
later
was
produced
at
drury
lane
and
was
promptly
damned
after
its
failure
lamb
wrote
to
hazlitt
we
are
determined
not
to
be
cast
down
i
am
going
to
leave
off
tobacco
and
then
we
must
thrive
a
smoky
man
must
write
smoky
farces
but
lamb
and
his
pipe
were
not
to
be
parted
by
even
repeated
resolutions
to
leave
off
smoking
it
was
years
after
this
that
he
met
macready
at
talfourd
and
by
way
probably
of
saying
something
to
shock
macready
whose
personality
could
hardly
have
been
sympathetic
to
him
uttered
the
remarkable
wish
that
the
last
breath
he
drew
in
might
be
through
a
pipe
and
exhaled
in
a
pun
it
was
in
that
lamb
published
the
collection
of
his
writings
in
two
volumes
which
contained
the
farewell
to
tobacco
written
in
and
referred
to
in
the
letter
of
that
year
to
wordsworth
quoted
above
its
phrases
of
mingled
abuse
and
affection
are
familiar
to
lovers
of
lamb
parr
is
reported
to
have
once
asked
lamb
how
he
could
smoke
so
much
and
so
fast
and
lamb
is
said
to
have
replied
i
toiled
after
it
sir
as
some
men
toil
after
virtue
but
if
all
accounts
are
true
parr
far
outsmoked
lamb
if
the
essayist
discontinued
or
modified
his
smoking
habits
he
made
up
for
it
by
devotion
to
snuff
a
devotion
which
his
sister
shared
a
large
usually
lay
on
the
table
between
them
and
they
pushed
it
one
to
the
other
but
it
is
time
to
return
to
the
cigar
and
the
changing
attitude
of
fashion
towards
smoking
there
would
appear
to
have
been
some
smokers
who
disliked
the
cigars
angelo
seems
from
various
passages
in
his
reminiscences
to
have
been
a
smoker
and
to
have
been
very
frequently
in
the
company
of
smokers
yet
he
could
write
there
are
few
things
which
after
a
foreign
tour
more
forcibly
remind
us
that
we
are
again
in
england
than
the
superiority
of
our
there
is
something
very
exhilarating
in
being
carried
through
the
air
with
rapidity
considering
the
rate
at
which
now
travel
in
and
just
before
a
place
on
the
box
or
front
of
a
prime
is
indeed
a
considerable
treat
but
alas
no
human
enjoyment
is
free
from
alloy
a
jew
pedlar
or
mendicant
foreigner
with
his
cigar
in
his
mouth
has
it
in
his
power
to
turn
the
draft
of
sweet
air
into
a
cup
of
bitterness
perhaps
objection
was
more
to
the
quality
of
the
cigar
that
would
be
smoked
by
a
jew
pedlar
or
mendicant
foreigner
than
to
the
cigar
itself
yet
going
on
to
describe
a
journey
to
hastings
sitting
on
the
roof
in
front
beside
an
acquaintance
he
says
notwithstanding
the
enjoyment
of
dashing
along
anecdote
and
jest
going
merrily
on
we
had
the
annoyance
of
a
coxcomb
perched
on
the
box
infecting
the
fresh
air
which
heaven
had
sent
us
with
the
smoke
of
his
abominable
cigar
which
looks
as
if
his
real
objection
was
to
as
such
the
fashionable
dislike
of
appears
in
the
pages
of
another
descriptive
writer
the
once
well
known
willis
the
american
author
of
many
books
of
travel
and
gossip
in
his
pencillings
by
the
way
writing
in
july
willis
describes
the
prevalence
of
smoking
in
vienna
among
all
the
nationalities
that
thronged
that
cosmopolitan
capital
it
is
he
says
like
a
fancy
ball
hungarians
poles
croats
wallachians
jews
moldavians
greeks
turks
all
dressed
in
their
national
and
stinking
costumes
promenade
up
and
down
smoking
all
and
none
exciting
the
slightest
observation
every
third
window
is
a
and
they
presumably
the
pipes
show
by
their
splendour
and
variety
the
expensiveness
of
the
passion
some
of
them
are
marked
dollars
the
streets
reek
with
you
never
catch
a
breath
of
untainted
air
within
the
glacis
your
hotel
your
café
your
coach
your
friend
are
all
redolent
of
the
same
disgusting
odour
in
the
following
year
describing
a
large
at
the
duke
of
gordon
in
scotland
willis
says
that
when
the
ladies
left
the
table
the
gentlemen
closed
up
and
conversation
assumed
a
merrier
cast
then
coffee
and
liqueurs
were
brought
in
when
the
wines
began
to
be
circulated
more
slowly
and
at
eleven
there
was
a
general
move
to
the
the
dinner
began
at
seven
so
the
guests
had
been
four
hours
at
table
but
smoking
is
not
mentioned
and
it
is
quite
certain
from
willis
silence
on
the
subject
the
disgusting
odour
would
surely
have
disturbed
him
that
no
single
member
of
the

so
far
come
in
again
that
a
considerable
proportion
of
the

of
the
house

were
smokers
macaulay
has
drawn
for
us
the
not
very
attractive
picture
of
the
of
the
old
house
of
commons
before
the
fire
of
in
a
letter
to
his
sister
dated
in
the
summer
of
i
have
left
sir
francis
burdett
on
his
legs
he
wrote
and
repaired
to
the
a
large
wainscoted
uncarpeted
place
with
tables
covered
with
green
baize
and
writing
materials
on
a
full
night
it
is
generally
thronged
towards
twelve
with
smokers
it
is
then
a
perfect
cloud
of
fume
there
have
i
seen
tell
it
not
to
the
west
indians
buxton
blowing
fire
out
of
his
mouth
my
father
will
not
believe
it
at
present
however
all
the
doors
and
windows
are
open
and
the
room
is
pure
enough
from
tobacco
to
suit
my
father
himself
in
july
he
again
dated
a
letter
to
his
sisters
from
the
house
of
commons
i
am
writing
here
he
says
at
eleven
at
night
in
this
filthiest
of
all
filthy
atmospheres
with
the
smell
of
tobacco
in
my
nostrils
reject
not
my
letter
though
it
is
redolent
of
cigars
and
genuine
pigtail
for
this
is
the
room
room
but
i
think
i
describe
it
in
rhyme
that
smells
of
tobacco
and
chloride
of
lime
the
smell
of
tobacco
was
always
the
same
but
the
chloride
was
bought
since
the
cholera
came
the
mention
of
pigtail
shows
that
the
house
contained
as
well
as
a
few
days
later
he
wrote
again
to
his
sisters
but
this
time
from
the
library
where
he
says
we
are
in
a
far
better
atmosphere
than
in
the
whence
i
wrote
to
you
last
week
one
wonders
why
macaulay
who
apparently
did
not
smoke
himself
and
who
though
somewhat
more
tolerant
of
tobacco
than
his
father
zachary
macaulay
evidently
did
not
like
the
atmosphere
of
the
chose
to
write
there
when
the
library
where
he
must
surely
have
felt
more
at
home
was
available

actually
smoked

that
he
possessed
two
of

and
had
come
across
another
in
a
dealer
shop
of
a
somewhat
peculiar
make
about
which
he
wished
to
get
information
it
is
of
the
ordinary
shape
he
wrote
but
differs
from
any
i
have
previously
seen
in
this
respect
that
it
works
with
a
sixpence
and
not
with
a
penny
or
halfpenny
it
is
engraved
with
the
usual
lines
except
that
the
user
is
asked
to
put
sixpence
in
the
till
and
then
to
shut
down
the
lid
under
penalty
of
a
fine
of
a
shilling
what
could
it
have
been
used
for
that
was
worth
sixpence
a
time
other
uncommon
features
are
that
the
money
portion
is
shallow
and
that
the
part
for
the
tobacco
extends
the
whole
length
of
the
box
i
should
say
that
the
box
is
much
smaller
than
any
others
i
have
ever
seen
no
information
as
to
the
use
of
this
curious
box
was
forthcoming
from
any
of
the
learned
and
ingenious
correspondents
of
and
and
a
problem
which
they
can
not
solve
may
not
unreasonably
be
regarded
as
insoluble
readers
of
dickens
are
familiar
with
the
drawing
by
cruikshank
which
illustrates
the
chapter
on
scotland
yard
in
dickens
sketches
by
boz
which
was
written
before
it
shows
the
sitting
round
the
fire
shouting
out
some
sturdy
chorus
and
smoking
long
clays
here
wrote
dickens
in
a
dark
of
ancient
appearance
cheered
by
the
glow
of
a
mighty
fire
sat
the
lusty
quaffing
large
draughts
of
barclay
best
and
puffing
forth
volumes
of
smoke
which
wreathed
heavily
above
their
heads
and
involved
the
room
in
a
thick
dark
cloud
these
good
folk
and
others
of
their
kin
had
never
been
affected
by
any
change
of
fashion
in
respect
of
smoking
in
another
of
the
sketches
the
amusing
at
ramsgate
when
poor
cymon
tuggs
is
hid
behind
the
curtain
half
dead
with
fear
he
hears
captain
waters
call
for
brandy
and
cigars
the
cigars
were
introduced
the
captain
was
a
professed
smoker
so
was
the
lieutenant
so
was
joseph
tuggs
poor
cymon
on
the
other
hand
was
one
of
those
who
could
never
smoke
without
feeling
it
indispensably
necessary
to
retire
immediately
and
never
could
smell
smoke
without
a
strong
disposition
to
cough
consequently
as
the
apartment
was
small
the
door
closed
and
the
smoke
powerful
poor
cymon
was
soon
compelled
to
cough
which
precipitated
the
catastrophe
it
is
noticeable
that
dickens
speaks
of
the
three
worthies
as
smokers
a
remark
which
suggests
that
such
men
who
would
take
cigars
as
a
matter
of
course
and
for
enjoyment
and
not
merely
out
of
a
complimentary
acquiescence
in
some
one
else
wish
were
comparatively
rare
other
illustrations
of
folk
who
smoked
not
cigars
but
pipes
may
be
drawn
from
pickwick
which
was
published
in
at
the
very
beginning
when
pickwick
calls
a
cab
at
saint
the
first
cab
is
fetched
from
the
where
he
had
been
smoking
his
first
pipe
at

pickwick
makes
notes
on
the
four
towns
of
strood
rochester
chatham
and
brompton
where
the
military
were
present
in
strength
and
hence
the
observant
gentleman
noted
the
consumption
of
tobacco
in
these
towns
must
be
very
great
and
the
smell
which
pervades
the
streets
must
be
exceedingly
delicious
to
those
who
are
extremely
fond
of
smoking
on
the
evening
of
the
election
at
eatanswill
tupman
and
snodgrass
resort
to
the
commercial
room
of
the
peacock
inn
where
the
atmosphere
was
redolent
of
the
fumes
of
which
had
communicated
a
rather
dingy
hue
to
the
whole
room
and
more
especially
to
the
dusty
red
curtains
which
shaded
the
windows
here
among
others
were
the
man
with
a
clay
pipe
the
very
man
behind
a
cigar
and
the
man
with
a
black
eye
who
slowly
filled
a
large
dutch
pipe
with
most
capacious
bowl
tupman
and
snodgrass
were
of
the
company
and
smoked
cigars
sam
weller
father
smoked
his
pipe
philosophically
if
flies
in
a
passion
and
breaks
his
pipe
he
steps
out
and
gets
another
then
she
screams
wery
loud
and
falls
into
and
he
smokes
wery
comfortably
she
comes
to
agin
what
better
example
could
there
be
of
philosophy
when
pickwick
and
sam
look
in
at
old
weller
house
of
call
off
cheapside
they
find
the
boxes
full
of
stage
coachmen
drinking
and
smoking
and
among
them
is
the
old
gentleman
himself
smoking
with
great
vehemence
after
having
given
his
son
valuable
parental
advice
weller
senior
refilled
his
pipe
from
a
tin
box
he
carried
in
his
pocket
and
lighting
his
fresh
pipe
from
the
ashes
of
the
old
one
commenced
smoking
at
a
great
rate
a
little
later
when
pickwick
hunts
up
perker
clerk
lowten
and
joins
the
jovial
circle
at
the
magpie
and
stump
he
finds
on
his
right
hand
a
gentleman
in
a
checked
shirt
and
mosaic
studs
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
who
expresses
the
hope
that
the
newcomer
does
not
find
this
sort
of
thing
disagreeable
not
in
the
least
replied
pickwick
i
like
it
very
much
although
i
am
no
smoker
myself
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
say
i
was
interposes
another
gentleman
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
it
board
and
lodging
to
me
is
smoke
pickwick
glances
at
the
speaker
and
thinks
that
if
it
were
washing
too
it
would
be
all
the
better
later
again
when
the
couple
o
sawbones
the
medical
students
ben
allen
and
bob
sawyer
make
their
first
appearance
on
the
scene
they
are
discovered
in
the
morning
seated
by
wardle
kitchen
fire
smoking
cigars
and
it
is
significant
of
how
smoking
out
of
doors
was
then
regarded
that
dickens
going
on
to
describe
sawyer
in
detail
refers
to
that
sort
of
slovenly
smartness
and
swaggering
gait
which
is
peculiar
to
young
gentlemen
who
smoke
in
the
streets
by
day
shout
and
scream
in
the
same
by
night
call
waiters
by
their
christian
names
and
do
various
other
acts
and
deeds
of
an
equally
facetious
description
apparently
in
the
only
person
who
would
allow
himself
to
be
seen
smoking
in
the
street
was
of
the
kind
naturally
inclined
to
do
the
other
objectionable
things
mentioned
the
same
idea
runs
through
the
allusions
to
tobacco
in

undeniably
vulgar

the

in
fact
to
trace
tobacco
through
the
pages
of

is
to
realize
vividly
how
vulgar
if
not
vicious
an
accomplishment
smoking
was
considered
by
the
fashionable
world
and
how
popular
it
was
among

the

was
an
abomination
to
the

the
reverend
gentleman

liking

faithful
to
the
traditional

for

but
smoking

in

about

and
greenhouses
where
they
were
good
for

plants
and
which
were
obviously
places
to
which
a

betake
himself

shocks

lamb
farewell
to
the
social

towards

for

was
curious
the
development
of
among
those
classes
from
which
tobacco
had
long
been
practically
banished
and
the
natural
consequent
spread
downwards
of
the
use
of

in

invariable
law
of
fashion
together
with
the
continued
devotion
to
the
pipe
among
those
whose
love
of
tobacco
had
never
slackened
made
smoking
a
much
more
general
practice
than
it
had
been
for
some
generations
it
is
somewhat
significant
that

after
the
other
his
wretched
wife
sitting
patiently
by
from
sunset
till
some
time
after
daybreak
the
tastes
however
were
catholic
a
little
later
in
the
book
the
reader
finds
him
when
encamped
in
the
back
parlour
of
the
old
man
shop
smoking
pipe
after
pipe
and
compelling
that
knavish
attorney
sampson
brass
to
do
the
same
always
caused
brass
great
internal
discomposure
and
annoyance
but
this
made
no
difference
to
quilp
who
insisted
on
his
friend
continuing
to
smoke
while
he
inquired
is
it
good
brass
is
it
nice
is
it
fragrant
do
you
feel
like
the
grand
turk
but
quilp
and
brass
were
not
in
society
notwithstanding
that
the
number
of
smokers
had
so
largely
increased
and
was
continually
increasing
smoking
was
regarded
socially
as
something
of
a
vice
to
be
practised
in
inconvenient
places
and
not
too
publicly
there
were
still
plenty
of
active
opponents
and
denouncers
of
tobacco
one
of
the
most
distinguished
was
the
great
duke
of
wellington
who
abominated
smoking
and
was
annoyed
by
the
increase
of
among
officers
of
the
army
in
the
early
he
issued
a
general
order
no
which
contained
a
paragraph
that
would
have
delighted
the
heart
of
king
james
i
it
ran
thus
the
has
been
informed
that
the
practice
of
smoking
by
the
use
of
pipes
cigars
or
cheroots
has
become
prevalent
among
the
officers
of
the
army
which
is
not
only
in
itself
a
species
of
intoxication
occasioned
by
the
fumes
of
tobacco
but
undoubtedly
occasions
drinking
and
tippling
by
those
who
acquire
the
habit
and
he
intreats
the
officers
commanding
regiments
to
prevent
smoking
in
the
mess
rooms
of
their
several
regiments
and
in
the
adjoining
apartments
and
to
discourage
the
practice
among
the
officers
of
junior
rank
in
their
regiments
the
duke
prejudices
were
stronger
than
his
facts
the
statement
not
very
grammatically
expressed
that
the
practice
of
smoking
was
itself
a
species
of
intoxication
was
absurd
enough
but
the
allegation
introduced
by
a
undoubtedly
that
smoking
occasioned
drinking
was
directly
contrary
to
fact
it
was
the
introduction
of
smoking
that
largely
helped
to
kill
the
bad
old
practice
of
continued
drinking
perhaps
the
best
reflection
of
and
comment
upon
the
attitude
of
society
towards
smoking
is
to
be
found
in
the
ironical
satirical
pages
of
thackeray
let
the
reader
turn
to
the
confessions
of
george
the
papers
first
appeared
in
for
and
he
will
find
how
smoking
was
regarded
at
that
date
and
what
thackeray
speaking
through
the
puppet
thought
of
it
george
starts
by
saying
i
am
not
in
the
first
place
what
is
called
a
ladies
man
having
contracted
an
irrepressible
habit
of
smoking
after
dinner
which
has
obliged
me
to
give
up
a
great
deal
of
the
dear
creatures
society
nor
can
i
go
much
to
for
the
same
reason
the
ladies
had
a
keen
scent
for
the
abominable
odour
of
tobacco
and
distrusted
the
men
who
smoked
here
is
or
thackeray
comment
on
it
what
is
this
smoking
that
it
should
be
considered
a
crime
i
believe
in
my
heart
that
women
are
jealous
of
it
as
of
a
rival
they
speak
of
it
as
of
some
secret
awful
vice
that
seizes
upon
a
man
and
makes
him
a
pariah
from
genteel
society
i
would
lay
a
guinea
that
many
a
lady
who
has
just
been
kind
enough
to
read
the
above
lines
lays
down
the
book
after
this
confession
of
mine
that
i
am
a
smoker
and
says
the
vulgar
wretch
and
passes
on
to
something
else
he
goes
on
to
prophesy
and
for
once
the
most
gratuitous
of
follies
has
been
justified
by
the
event
that
tobacco
will
conquer
look
over
the
wide
world
he
says
to
the
ladies
and
see
that
your
adversary
has
overcome
it
germany

been
puffing
for
three
score
years
france

do
you
think
you
can
keep
the
enemy
out
of
england
psha
look
at
his
progress
ask
the
have
they
or
not
are
they
not
obliged
to
yield
to
the
general
want
of
the
age
in
spite
of
the
resistance
of
the
old
women
on
the
committees
i
for
my
part
do
not
despair
to
see
a
bishop
lolling
out
of
the
with
a
cheroot
in
his
mouth
or
at
any
rate
a
pipe
stuck
in
his
the
flight
of
fancy
in
the
last
sentence
has
hardly
yet
been
fulfilled
but
i
saw
many
years
ago
a
distinguished
man
of
letters
the
late
francis
turner
palgrave
of
golden
treasury
fame
who
was
an
inveterate
smoker
sitting
on
one
of
the
cane
benches
by
the
door
of
the
athenæum
club
smoking
a
short
clay
pipe
thackeray
does
not
appear
to
have
realized
that
tobacco
was
not
invading
england
for
the
first
but
for
the
second
time
nor
did
he
foresee
that
the
ladies
to
whom
he
addressed
his
impassioned
defence
of
smoking
would
not
only
submit
to
the
conqueror
but
would
themselves
be
found
among
his
joyous
devotees
george
recounts
how
as
a
boy
he
was
flogged
for
smoking
and
how
at
oxford
smoking
among
other
villainies
led
to
his
rustication
later
his
tobacco
combined
with
insolence
to
his
colonel
conducted
him
out
of
the
army
into
the
retirement
of
civil
life
and
so
on
and
so
on
there
is
of
course
an
element
of
exaggeration
in
all
this
but
experiences
and
reflections
throw
much
light
on
the
social
history
of
smoking
in
the
early
decades
of
the
nineteenth
century
harry
furniss
in
the
preface
to
his
edition
of
thackeray
has
an
admirably
terse
and
pertinent
paragraph
on
this
aspect
of
the
papers
he
says
no
gentleman
in
those
days
was
seen
smoking
even
a
in
the
streets
cigarettes
were
practically
unheard
of
in
england
and
outside
one
private
pipes
were
tabooed
men
in
society
slunk
into
their
or
when
there
was
no
into
the
kitchen
or
servants
hall
after
the
domestics
had
retired
a
was
worn
in
the
place
of
their
ordinary
evening
coat
and
their
massive
head
of
hair
was
protected
by
a
gorgeously
decorated
thus
the
odour
of
tobacco
was
not
brought
into
the
the
fear
of
the
odour
of
was
extraordinary
buckmaster
in
his
reminiscences
describes
the
famous
debating
society
at
cogers
hall
and
says
that
after
one
night
at
the
cogers
it
took
three
days
on
a
common
to
purify
your
clothes
from
the
smoke
the
journalists
and
bohemians
who
met
at
the
cogers
were
above
or
below
the
dictates
of
fashion
and
smoking
was
always
a
feature
of
their
gatherings
the
yard
of
clay
is
provided
gratis
for
members
and
it
is
to
its
almost
universal
use
says
peter
rayleigh
in
his
book
on
the
cogers
and
fleet
street
that
cogers
owe
their
existence
in
the
present
quarters
once
upon
a
time
the
cogers
to
a
room
where
carpets
covered
the
floors
the
chairs
were
upholstered
and
the
tables
had
finely
polished
marble
tops
the
hot
pipes
and
smouldering
matches
stained
the
table
tops
and
burnt
the
carpets
so
that
they
had
the
option
of
abandoning
either
the
pipe
or
the
quarters
old
customs
die
hard
with
cogers
and
they
stuck
to
their
pipe
the
pipe
is
a
feature
in
all
illustrations
of
cogerian
meetings
the
influence
of
the
court
was
wholly
against
smoking
both
queen
victoria
and
the
prince
consort
detested
it
so
tobacco
was
taboo
wherever
the
court
was
the
late
lady
dorothy
nevill
who
lived
to
see
the
new
triumph
of
tobacco
said
that
she
thought
the
greatest
minor
change
in
social
habits
which
she
had
witnessed
was
that
in
the
attitude
assumed
towards
smoking
which
in
her
youth
and
even
later
was
except
in
certain
circumstances
regarded
as
little
less
than
a
heinous
crime
lady
dorothy
remarked
that
in
country
houses
were
absolutely
unknown
but
that
was
not
quite
correct
as
we
shall
see
in
the
experiences
of
professor
von
holtzendorff
to
be
mentioned
directly
and
that
such
gentlemen
as
wished
to
smoke
after
the
ladies
had
gone
to
bed
used
as
a
matter
of
course
to
go
either
to
the
servants
hall
or
to
the
in
the
stables
where
at
night
some
sort
of
rough
preparation
was
generally
made
for
their
accommodation
well
do
i
remember
the
immense
care
which
devotees
of
tobacco
used
to
take
when
sallying
forth
in
the
country
to
enjoy
it
not
to
allow
the
faintest
whiff
of
smoke
to
penetrate
into
the
hall
as
they
lit
their
cigars
at
the
door
in
dickens
wrote
i
generally
take
a
cigar
after
dinner
when
alone
the
reservation
in
the
last
three
words
may
be
noted
in
the
book
of
snobs
major
wellesley
ponto
goes
to
smoke
a
cigar
in
the
stables
ponto
had
no
with
lord
gules
who
is
described
as
a
very
young
short
and
nobleman
who
can
not
have
left
the
nursery
very
long
later
ponto
and
gules
resume
smoking
operations
in
the
now
vacant
kitchen
even
so
late
as
the
attitude
towards
smoking
was
still
much
the
same
in
some
quarters
in
that
year
a
german
scholar
professor
franz
von
holtzendorff
paid
a
visit
to
a
country
gentleman
house
in
gloucestershire
hardwicke
court
later
he
printed
an
account
of
his
experiences
a
translation
of
which
was
published
in
this
country
in
when
the
professor
arrived
his
host
the
first
greeting
over
at
once
pointed
out
to
him
a
secluded
apartment
the
one
which
he
thought
it
most
important
for
a
german
to
know
namely
the
according
to
his
idea
continued
the
professor
every
german
has
three
national
characteristics
smoking
singing
and
the
first
and
only
idea
in
which
i
found
him
led
astray
by
an
abstract
theory
later
his
hostess
explaining
to
him
the
method
and
routine
of
life
in
an
english
said
that
the
ladies
retired
about
eleven
while
the
gentlemen
finished
their
day
work
in
the
the
secluded
apartment
or
enjoyed
a
cigar
at
the
but
a
smoke
in
the
was
only
allowed
if
that
room
was
not
near
the
or
in
the
hall
close
by
you
must
have
often
been
surprised
she
continued
that
we
english
ladies
have
such
an
invincible
repugnance
to
tobacco
smoke
but
there
is
no
dispensation
from
our
rule
of
abstinence
except
in
those
rooms
which
my
husband
has
already
pointed
out
to
you
the
professor
after
luncheon
was
pressed
by
the
squire
who
on
any
other
occasion
would
never
waste
time
in
smoking
and
only
filled
his
short
clay
pipe
at
the
end
of
his
day
work
to
come
to
his
as
regards
this
room
the
professor
drily
remarked
i
thought
i
had
noticed
that
even
the
was
stopped
up
in
order
to
preserve
the
ladies
delicate
nerves
from
every
disagreeable
sensation
after
dinner
again
when
the
ladies
had
left
the
table
the
gentlemen
passed
the
bottles
of
port
sherry
and
claret
with
the
regularity
of
planets
from
hand
to
hand
but
no
one
dreamed
of
smoking
that
was
reserved
for
the
secluded
apartment
after
the
ladies
had
gone
to
bed
neither
host
nor
guest
imagined
what
a
revolution
another
generation
or
so
would
make
in
these
social
habits
in
the
the
pipes
smoked
were
mostly
clays
there
were
the
long
clays
or
churchwardens
to
be
smoked
in
hours
of
ease
and
leisure
and
the
short
clays
cutties
which
could
be
smoked
while
a
man
was
at
work
milo
a
tobacconist
in
the
strand
and
inderwick
whose
shop
was
near
leicester
square
were
famous
for
their
pipes
which
could
be
bought
for
apiece

in
praise
of

old
black
pipe

i
am
indebted
for
this
quotation
to
a
correspondent
of
and
september
another
correspondent
of
the
same
journal
colonel
prideaux
also
replying
to
a
query
of
mine
wrote
before
pipes
came
into
common
use
clay
pipes
were
of
necessity
smoked
by
all
classes
when
i
matriculated
at
oxford
at
the
easter
of
university
men
used
to
be
rather
particular
about
the
pipes
they
smoked
the
finest
were
made
in
france
and
the
favourite
brand
was
saint
omer
i
do
not
know
if
this
kind
is
still
smoked
but
it
was
made
of
a
soft
clay
that
easily
coloured
in
taverns
of
course
the
churchwarden
beloved
of
carlyle
and
tennyson
was
usually
smoked
to
the
accompaniment
of
shandygaff
at
simpson
fish
ordinary
at
billingsgate
these
pipes
were
always
placed
on
the
table
after
dinner
together
with
screws
of
shag
tobacco
and
a
smoking
parliament
moistened
with
hot
or
cold
punch
according
to
the
season
was
generally
held
during
the
following
hour
of
course
in
those
days
no
one
ever
thought
of
smoking
a
pipe
in
the
presence
of
ladies
colonel
harold
malet
at
the
same
time
wrote
when
i
was
a
cadet
at
sandhurst
in
milo
cutty
pipes
were
quite
the
thing
and
the
selection
by
cadets
of
a
good
one
out
of
a
fresh
consignment
packed
in
sawdust
was
eagerly
watched
by
the
of
course
we
were
imitating
our
parents
it
was
no
doubt
these
cutty
pipes
which
are
referred
to
in
one
of
the
sporting
books
of
robert
surtees
as
the
clay
pipes
of
gentility
in
a
private
letter
to
me
which
i
am
privileged
to
quote
colonel
prideaux
adds
some
further
particulars
as
to
the
social
attitude
of
early
victorian
days
towards
tobacco
particulars
which
are
the
more
valuable
and
interesting
as
being
supplied
from
personal
recollection
of
those
now
somewhat
distant
days
the
colonel
writes
when
i
was
a
young
man
people
never
thought
of
smoking
in
what
call
the
the
principal
reason
being
that
the
occupation
of
these
rooms
was
shared
by
ladies
and
it
was
form
not
by
the
way
a
contemporary
expression
to
smoke
while
in
the
company
of
the
fairer
half
of
creation
consequently
men
had
either
to
indulge
in
the
practice
out
of
doors
or
else
as
you
say
sneak
away
to
the
kitchen
when
the
servants
had
gone
to
bed
and
puff
up
the
chimney
it
was
only
in
large
houses
that
a
billiard
room
could
be
found
and
even
in
a
billiard
room
a
pipe
or
cigar
was
if
ladies
were
present
while
could
no
more
be
found
in
houses
than
both
cutties
and
churchwardens
were
smoked
but
the
latter
of
course
were
not
adapted
for
persons
engaged
in
active
pursuits
and
were
essentially
of
what
i
may
call
a
sedentary
nature
you
could
not
even
walk
while
holding
a
long
churchwarden
in
your
mouth
and
consequently
the
short
clay
was
most
favoured
by
young
men
at
sandhurst
and
the
universities
labourers
smoked
short
clays
when
out
of
doors
and
churchwardens
when
they
rested
from
their
labours
and
took
their
ease
in
their
inn
in
the
evenings
furniss
in
the
paragraph
quoted
on
a
previous
page
says
no
gentleman
in
those
days
was
seen
smoking
even
a
in
the
streets
the
nearest
approach
to
this
seems
to
have
been
smoking
on
club
steps
thackeray
in
the
seventeenth
chapter
of
the
book
of
snobs
speaks
of
dandies
smoking
their
cigars
upon
the
steps
of
white
most
fashionable
of
clubs
and
in
an
earlier
chapter
of
young
ensign
famish
lounging
and
smoking
on
the
steps
of
the
union
jack
club
with
half
a
dozen
other
young
rakes
of
the
fourth
or
fifth
order
two
of
thackeray
own
drawings
in
the
book
of
snobs
in
chapters
three
and
nine
show
men
one
civil
the
other
military
smoking
cigars
out
of
doors
but
as
these
were
no
doubt
arrant
snobs
the
drawings
may
be
accepted
as
proof
of
statement
in
this
same
book
thackeray
says
ironically
think
of
that
den
of
abomination
which
i
am
told
has
been
established
in
clubs

satirist

very
familiar

the
little
the
garrick
the
original
garrick
was
at
king
street
covent
garden
where
the
club
was
founded
in
it
had
formerly
been
a
quiet
family
hotel
but
apparently
was
not
furnished
with
a
for
one
of
the
first
acts
of

they
obtained

and
comfortable

that
this
room
which
was
reached
by
a
long
passage
from
the
was
not
a
cheerful
apartment
by
daylight
and
when
empty
but
which
at
night
and
full
was
thought
the
most
cheerful
apartment
in
town
at
other
clubs
of
more
fashion
perhaps
but
certainly
of
less
made
their
way
more
slowly
at
white
smoking
was
not
allowed
at
all
till
the
alfred
club
founded
in
which
lord
byron
described
as
pleasant
a
little
too
sober
and
literary
perhaps
but
on
the
whole
a
decent
resource
on
a
rainy
day
and
which
sir
william
fraser
called
a
sort
of
minor
athenæum
owed
its
death
in
if
report
be
true
to
a
dispute
about
smoking
one
section
of
the
members
wished
for
an
improved
they
called
the
existing
room
which
was
at
the
top
of
the
house
an
infamous
hole
while
the
more
and
more
influential
members
objected
to
any
improvement
the
latter
carried
the
day
but
the
consequent
loss
of
members
ruined
the
club
which
soon
after
ceased
to
exist
this
secession
must
have
been
subsequent
to
that
of
the
bishops
of
whom
at
one
time
many
were
members
but
who
left
it
is
said
because
of
the
introduction
of
a
the
growth
of
was
rapid
steinmetz
in
his
book
on
tobacco
published
in
remarked
that
no
way
of
using
tobacco
had
made
a
more
striking
advance
in
england
within
the
preceding
twenty
years
than
cigars
for
a
long
time
it
had
been
confined
in
this
country
to
the
richer
class
of
smokers
but
when
he
wrote
it
was
in
universal
use
the
wonder
is
that
with
so
many
men
smoking
cigars
the
old
domestic
and
club
restrictions
as
pilloried
in
thackeray
pages
were
maintained
so
long
in
leech
had
an
admirably
drawn
sketch
in
of
paterfamilias
in
the
absence
of
his
wife
giving
a
little
dinner
beside
him
sits
his
small
son
and
on
either
side
of
the
table
sit
two
of
his
cronies
one
has
a
cigar
in
his
hand
and
is
blowing
a
cloud
of
smoke
while
the
other
is
selecting
a
weed
the
host
is
just
lighting
his
cigar
as
the
maid
enters
with
a
tray
of
decanters
and
glasses
and
with
disgust
written
plainly
on
her
face
the
objectionable
child
beside
him
says
lor
pa
are
you
going
to
smoke
my
eye
wo
you
catch
it
when
ma
comes
home
for
making
the
curtains
smell
another
witness
to
the
rapid
development
of
is
captain
gronow
the
author
of
the
reminiscences
gronow
says
that
the
famous
surgeon
sir
astley
cooper
on
one
occasion
perceiving
that
he
was
fond
of
smoking
cautioned
him
against
that
habit
telling
him
that
it
would
sooner
or
later
be
the
cause
of
his
death
this
must
have
been
before
when
sir
astley
died
writing
in
the
gronow
said
if
sir
astley
were
now
alive
he
would
find
everybody
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
men
smoke
nowadays
whilst
they
are
occupied
in
working
or
hunting
riding
in
carriages
or
otherwise
employed
which
shows
how
the
prejudice
against
outdoor
smoking
was
then
breaking
down
during
the
experience
of
a
long
life
however
continued
gronow
i
never
knew
but
one
person
of
whom
it
was
said
that
smoking
was
the
cause
of
his
death
he
was
the
son
of
an
irish
earl
and
an
attaché
at
our
embassy
in
paris
but
alas
i
have
known
thousands
who
have
been
carried
off
owing
to
their
love
of
the
bottle
thackeray
as
the
satirist
of
the
foolish
social
prejudices
against
smoking
was
naturally
an
inveterate
smoker
himself
he
died
in
and
so
hardly
saw
the
beginning
of
a
change
in
the
attitude
of
society
towards
the
pestilent
weed
but
he
was
one
of
the
many
men
of
letters
and
artists
who
despising
the
conventions
of
society
were
largely
instrumental
in
breaking
down
stupid
restrictions
and
in
overcoming
senseless
prejudices
and
were
thus
heralds
of
freedom
charles
keene
attitude
was
that
of
many
artists
he
smoked
a
little
jacobean
clay
pipe
in
his
overlooking
the
strand
and
did
not
care
in
the
least
what
the
world
might
think
or
not
think
about
that
or
any
other
subject
those
who
smoked
pipes
at
cambridge
continued
to
smoke
pipes
afterwards
whatever
society
might
do
spedding
who
spent
his
life
on
the
elucidation
of
bacon
was
one
of
the
apostles
and
he
continued
a
to
the
end
in
we
hear
of
tennyson
being
in
london
with
him
and
smoking
all
the
day
lady
ritchie
in
tennyson
and
his
friends
says
i
can
remember
vaguely
on
one
occasion
through
a
cloud
of
smoke
looking
across
a
darkening
room
at
the
noble
grave
head
of
the
poet
laureate
he
was
sitting
with
my
father
in
the
twilight
after
some
family
meal
in
the
old
house
in
kensington
thackeray
was
a
but
tennyson
was
a
devotee
of
the
pipe
it
was
on
this
occasion
as
the
poet
himself
reminded
thackeray
daughter
that
while
the
novelist
was
speaking
lady
ritchie
little
sister
looked
up
suddenly
from
the
book
over
which
she
had
been
absorbed
saying
in
her
sweet
childish
voice
why
do
you
not
write
books
like
nickleby
tennyson
wrote
in
memoriam
at
shawell
rectory
near
lutterworth
leicestershire
the
rector
was
a
elmhirst
a
native
of
the
lincolnshire
village
the
latest
historian
of
lutterworth
says
that
the
great
puffs
of
tobacco
smoke
with
which
he
tennyson
mellowed
his
thoughts
proved
insufferable
to
his
host
and
he
was
accordingly
turned
out
into
elmhirst
workshop
in
the
garden
which
in
consequence
became
the
birthplace
of
one
of
the
gems
of
english
literature
about
when
tennyson
often
dined
at
the
old
cock
by
temple
bar
and
at
other
taverns
the
perfect
dinner
for
his
taste
says
his
son
was
a
a
potato
a
cut
of
cheese
a
pint
of
port
and
afterwards
a
pipe
never
a
cigar
when
the
kingsleys
paid
the
tennysons
a
visit
about
charles
kingsley
so
the
laureate
told
his
son
talked
as
usual
on
all
sorts
of
topics
and
walked
hard
up
and
down
the
study
for
hours
smoking
furiously
and
affirming
that
tobacco
was
the
only
thing
that
kept
his
nerves
quiet
the
late
laureate
alfred
austin
once
asked
tennyson
after
reading
a
passage
in
dorothy
wordsworth
journal
that
william
had
gone
to
bed
very
tired
with
writing
the
prelude
if
he
had
ever
felt
tired
by
writing
poetry
i
think
not
said
the
poet
but
tired
with
the
accompaniment
of
too
much
smoking
kingsley
devotion
to
smoke
seems
to
have
surprised
tennyson
who
was
no
light
smoker
himself
the
most
curious
story
illustrating
kingsley
love
of
tobacco
is
that
told
in
the
life
of
archbishop
benson
by
his
son
benson
one
day
about
the
year
the
future
archbishop
was
walking
with
the
rector
of
eversley
in
a
remote
part
of
the
parish
on
a
common
when
kingsley
suddenly
said
i
must
smoke
a
pipe
and
forthwith
went
to
a
and
felt
about
in
it
for
a
time
presently
he
produced
a
clay
churchwarden
pipe
which
he
lighted
and
solemnly
smoked
as
he
walked
putting
it
when
he
had
done
into
a
hole
among
some
tree
roots
and
telling
my
father
that
he
had
a
of
pipes
in
several
places
in
the
parish
to
meet
the
exigencies
of
a
sudden
desire
for
tobacco
if
this
story
did
not
appear
in
the
life
of
an
archbishop
some
scepticism
on
the
part
of
the
reader
might
be
excused
carlyle
as
every
one
knows
was
a
great
smoker
the
story
is
familiar
it
may
be
true
that
one
evening
he
and
tennyson
sat
in
solemn
silence
smoking
for
hours
one
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
and
that
when
the
visitor
rose
to
go
carlyle
as
he
bade
him
said
man
alfred
we
hae
had
a
graund
nicht
come
again
soon
tennyson
own
devotion
to
tobacco
led
on
at
least
one
occasion
to
a
peculiar
and
somewhat
questionable
proceeding
rossetti
had
a
temporary
acquaintance
with
the
poet
and
in
the
reminiscences
which
he
published
in
he
told
a
curious
anecdote
concerning
him
which
was
new
to
print
rossetti
told
on
the
authority
of
woolner
how
in
the
course
of
a
trip
with
friends
to
italy
tobacco
such
as
tennyson
could
smoke
gave
out
at
some
particular
city
whereupon
the
poet
packed
up
his
portmanteau
and
returned
home
breaking
up
the
party
the
late
joseph
knight
who
reviewed
rossetti
volumes
in
the
vouched
for
the
truth
of
this
relation
which
he
had
heard
not
only
from
woolner
but
also
from
tennyson
brother
septimus
in
more
fashionable
circles
the
mere
possession
of
a
pipe
might
be
looked
at
askance
robertson
comedy
society
was
produced
in
and
in
it
tom
stylus
a
somewhat
bohemian
journalist
has
the
misfortune
in
a
fashionable
when
pulling
out
his
handkerchief
to
bring
out
his
pipe
with
it
from
his
pocket
the
vulgar
thing
falls
upon
the
floor
and
tom
is
ashamed
to
claim
his
property
and
so
acknowledge
his
ownership
of
a
pipe
he
presently
calls
a
footman
who
comes
with
a
tray
and
picks
up
the
offending
briar
with
the
tongs
and
carries
it
off
with
an
air
of
ineffable
disgust
undergraduates
like
men
of
letters
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
the
conventional
attitude
of
society
towards
tobacco
and
pipes
maintained
their
popularity
in
college
rooms
thackeray
in
the
book
of
snobs
describes
youths
at
a
university
as
drinking
bad
wines
telling
bad
stories
singing
bad
songs
over
and
over
again
milk
punch
smoking
ghastly
headache
frightful
spectacle
of
next
morning
and
smell
of
tobacco
but
the
satirist
is
often
tempted
to
be
epigrammatic
at
the
expense
of
accuracy
and
this
picture
is
at
least
too
highly
coloured
in
the
recently
published
memoir
of
j
john
willis
clark
some
reminiscences
of
the
late
registrary
are
included
and
j
does
not
recognize
thackeray
picture
as
quite
true
of
the
wines
of
his
undergraduate
day
about
they
may
he
says
have
bad
stories
and
sung
bad
songs
as
thackeray
says
in
his
of
snobs
i
can
only
say
that
i
never
heard
either
the
one
or
the
other
but
certainly
there
was
noise
and
there
was
smoke
plenty
of
it
conversation
there
was
none
says
j
only
a
noise
then
came
smoke
in
a
short
time
the
atmosphere
became
dense
the
dessert
and
the
wine
came
to
an
end
and
it
was
chapel
time
mercifully
one
story
clark
tells
of
an
extraordinary
attempt
to
smoke
referring
to
the
compulsory
chapels
he
says
that
as
a
rule
everybody
behaved
with
propriety
whether
they
regarded
the
attendance
as
irksome
or
otherwise
but
he
admits
corner
as
the
space
at
the
east
end
on
each
side
of
the
altar
was
called
may
occasionally
have
effectually
sheltered
but
when
a
young
snob
went
so
far
as
to
light
a
cigar
there
he
had
the
pleasure
of
finishing
it
in
the
country
for
he
was
rusticated
it
was
on
a
cognate
occasion
in
jesus
college
in
which
cobblers
wax
played
a
prominent
part
that
corrie
dismissed
the
culprit
after
a
severe
lecture
with
these
admirable
words
conduct
sir
is
what
a
christian
would
call
profane
and
a
gentleman
vulgar
at
oxford
in
november
the
and
proctors
issued
the
following
notice
which
shows
that
an
occasional
outbreak
of
bad
manners
might
happen
on
the
isis
as
on
the
cam
whereas
complaints
have
been
made
that
some
undergraduate
members
of
the
university
are
in
the
habit
of
smoking
at
and
otherwise
creating
annoyance
they
are
hereby
cautioned
against
the
repetition
of
such
ungentlemanlike
conduct
there
was
plenty
of
smoking
among
undergraduates
at
oxford
in
those
days
as
may
be
seen
in
such
books
as
the
adventures
of
verdant
green
and
hughes
tom
brown
at
oxford
both
of
which
date
from
when
tom
after
a
thought
of
going
out
there
was
a
wine
party
at
one
of
his
acquaintance
rooms
or
he
could
go
and
smoke
a
cigar
in
the
or
at
any
one
of
a
dozen
other
places
cigars
were
the
fashionable
form
of
smoke
when
tom
offers
his
box
to
captain
hardy
that
worthy
son
says
you
might
as
well
give
him
a
glass
of
absinthe
he
is
churchwarden
at
home
and
smoke
anything
but
a
long
clay
with
which
the
old
sailor
was
accordingly
supplied
a
striking
example
of
the
attitude
of
the
century
days
towards
tobacco
may
be
found
in
connexion
with
railways
and
railway
travelling
in
the
early
days
of
such
travel
there
were
no
smoking
compartments
and
indeed
smoking
was
strictly
forbidden
practically
everywhere
on
railway
premises
relics
of
this
time
may
still
be
seen
in
many
stations
and
on
many
platforms
in
the
shape
of
somewhat
dingy
placards
announcing
that
smoking
is
strictly
forbidden
and
that
the
penalty
is
so
much
nowadays
the
incense
from
pipes
and
cigars
and
cigarettes
curls
freely
round
these
obsolete
notices
and
helps
to
make
them
still
dingier
if
you
wanted
to
smoke
when
travelling
you
had
either
to
contrive
to
get
a
compartment
to
yourself
or
to
arrange
terms
with
your
in
a
of
leech
drew
a
scene
wherein
figures
one
of
those
precocious
youngsters
of
a
type
he
loved
to
draw
a
railway
porter
says
to
his
mate
as
the
two
gaze
at
the
back
of
this
small
swell
with
his
cane
and
what
does
he
say
bill
why
he
says
he
must
have
a
compartment
to
hisself
because
he
ca
get
on
without
his
smoke
another
drawing
in
a
of
points
the
same
moral
it
represents
an
elderly
party
and
a
fast
etonian
seated
side
by
side
in
a
compartment
the
latter
has
a
cigar
in
one
hand
and
with
the
other
offers
coins
to
his
neighbour
the
explanation
is
as
follows
really
sir
i
am
the
manager
of
the
line
sir
i
must
inform
you
that
if
you
persist
in
smoking
you
will
be
fined
forty
shillings
sir
well
old
boy
i
must
have
my
smoke
so
you
may
as
well
take
your
forty
shillings
now
tobacco
was
always
popular
in
the
army
and
even
the
strongest
of
would
have
felt
that
there
was
at
least
something
if
not
much
to
be
said
for
the
abused
weed
when
in
times
of
campaigning
suffering
it
played
so
beneficent
a
part
in
soothing
and
comforting
weary
and
wounded
men
the
period
covered
by
this
chapter
included
both
the
crimean
war
and
the
indian
mutiny
and
every
one
knows
how
the
soldiers
in
the
crimea
and
in
india
alike
craved
for
tobacco
as
for
one
of
the
greatest
of
luxuries
and
how
even
an
occasional
smoke
cheered
and
encouraged
and
sustained
suffering
humanity
the
late
norman
kerr
who
was
no
friend
to
ordinary
everyday
smoking
wrote
there
are
occasions
such
as
in
the
trenches
during
military
operations
when
worn
out
with
exposure
and
fatigue
or
when
exhausted
by
slow
starvation
with
no
food
in
prospect
when
a
pipe
or
cigar
will
be
a
welcome
and
valuable
friend
in
need
resting
the
weary
limbs
cheering
the
fainting
heart
allaying
the
gnawing
hunger
of
the
empty
stomach
sir
forrest
in
his
book
on
the
indian
mutiny
tells
how
at
the
siege
of
lucknow
as
the
month
of
august
advanced
the
tea
and
sugar
except
a
small
store
kept
for
invalids
were
exhausted
the
tobacco
also
was
gone
and
europeans
and
natives
suffered
greatly
from
the
want
of
it
the
soldiers
yearned
for
a
pipe
after
a
hard
day
work
and
smoked
dry
leaves
as
the
only
substitute
they
could
obtain
rees
in
his
diary
of
the
same
siege
noted
i
have
given
up
smoking
tobacco
and
have
taken
to
and
and
guava
instead
which
the
poor
soldiers
are
also
constantly
using
the
is
better
known
perhaps
as
the
margosa
it
yields
a
bitter
oil
and
is
supposed
to
possess
febrifugal
properties
among
the
general
mass
of
the
population
in
the
early
victorian
period
smoking
though
certainly
not
so
as
now
was
yet
very
common
it
is
highly
probable
that
one
of
the
things
which
led
to
the
great
increase
in
which
took
place
from
this
time
onwards
was
the
introduction
of
the
briar
pipe
the
earliest
example
of
the
use
of
a
wooden
pipe
i
have
met
with
is
dated
but
this
was
not
in
england
many
years
ago
the
late
munby
pointed
out
that
smollett
in
one
of
his
letters
dated
march
giving
an
account
of
his
journey
from
nice
to
turin
describes
how
he
ascended
the
mountain
brovis
and
on
the
top
thereof
met
a
quixotic
figure
whom
he
thus
pictures
he
was
very
tall
meagre
and
yellow
with
a
long
hooked
nose
and
twinkling
eyes
his
head
was
cased
in
a
woollen
nightcap
over
which
he
wore
a
flapped
hat
he
had
a
silk
handkerchief
about
his
neck
and
his
mouth
was
furnished
with
a
short
wooden
pipe
from
which
he
discharged
wreathing
clouds
of
this
scarecrow
turned
out
to
be
an
italian
marquis
and
no
doubt
the
singularity
of
his
smoking
apparatus
was
of
a
piece
with
the
singularity
of
his
attire
munby
after
this
reference
to
smollett
adventure
proceeded
to
claim
the
honour
of
having
helped
to
bring
the
use
of
wooden
pipes
into
england
in
the
year
he
wrote
meerschaums
and
clays
were
the
rule
at
both
the
english
universities
and
in
all
shops
throughout
the
land
and
the
art
of
making
pipes
of
wood
was
either
obsolete
it
had
never
been
introduced
or
wholly
but
a
college
friend
of
mine
a
norfolk
squire
possessed
a
gardener
who
was
of
an
inventive
turn
though
he
was
not
a
scotchman
this
man
conceived
and
wrought
out
the
idea
of
making
pipes
of
cutting
the
bowl
out
of
a
thick
stem
and
the
tube
out
of
a
thinner
one
growing
from
the
bowl
so
that
the
whole
pipe
was
in
one
piece
is
too
soft
so
that
the
pipes
did
not
last
long
but
they
were
a
valuable
discovery
and
the
young
squire
friends
bought
them
eagerly
at
eighteenpence
apiece
this
experiment
in
the
direction
of
wooden
pipes
was
interesting
and
deserves
to
be
remembered
but
it
was
not
long
before
the
briar
was
introduced
and
carried
everything
before
it
it
was
about
that
the
use
of
the
root
of
the
white
heath
a
native
of
the
south
of
france
corsica
and
some
other
localities
for
the
purpose
of
making
was
introduced
into
this
country
the
word
brier
or
briar
has
no
connexion
whatever
with
the
prickly
thorny
briar
which
bears
the
lovely
wild
rose
it
is
derived
from
the
french
heath
the
root
of
the
white
heath
being
the
material
known
as
briar
or
brier
and
at
first
as
bruyer
the
oxford
dictionary
quotes
an
advertisement
from
the
trade
of
so
recent
a
date
as
february
of
a
heath
pipe
in
bruyer
wood
the
briar
pipe
not
only
soon
drove
the
clay
largely
out
of
use
but
immensely
increased
the
number
of
bulwer
lytton
may
not
have
known
the
briar
but
he
wrote
enthusiastically
of
the
pipe
every
smoker
knows
the
glowing
tribute
he
paid
to
it
in
his
night
and
morning
which
appeared
in
it
is
terser
and
more
to
the
point
than
most
panegyrics
a
pipe
it
is
a
great
soother
a
pleasant
comforter
blue
devils
fly
before
its
honest
breath
it
ripens
the
brain
it
opens
the
heart
and
the
man
who
smokes
thinks
like
a
sage
and
acts
like
a
samaritan

henry
leigh
the
social
history
of
smoking
in
later
victorian
days
is
marked
by
the
triumph
of
the
cigarette
the
introduction
of
the
cigar
as
we
have
seen
brought
about
the
revival
of
smoking
from
the
point
of
view
of
fashion
in
the
early
decades
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
the
coming
of
the
cigarette
completed
what
the
cigar
had
begun
the
earliest
references
for
the
word
cigarette
in
the
oxford
dictionary
are
dated
and
but
both
refer
to
the
smoking
of
cigarettes
abroad
in
france
and
italy
the
quotation
is
from
a
book
by
romer
in
which
she
says
the
beggars
in
the
streets
have
paper
cigars
called
cigarettes
in
their
mouths
the
wording
here
would
seem
to
show
that
cigarettes
were
not
then
familiar
to
english
people
laurence
oliphant
who
was
both
a
man
of
letters
and
a
man
of
fashion
is
generally
credited
with
the
introduction
into
english
society
of
the
cigarette
but
it
is
difficult
to
suggest
even
an
approximate
date
writing
from
boulogne
to
wills
in
september
dickens
says
i
have
nearly
exhausted
the
cigarettes
i
brought
here
and
proceeds
to
give
directions
for
some
to
be
sent
to
him
from
london
this
is
the
earliest
reference
i
have
found
to
in
england
but
it
is
possible
that
by
cigarettes
dickens
meant
not
what
we
now
know
as
such
but
simply
small
cigars
hyndman
in
his
record
of
an
adventurous
life
says
that
when
he
was
living
as
a
pupil
about
the
year
with
the
rector
of
oxburgh
his
included
edward
abbott
of
salonica
who
poor
fellow
was
battered
to
pieces
by
the
turks
with
iron
staves
torn
from
palings
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
now
so
popular
was
then
almost
unknown
and
abbott
who
always
smoked
the
finest
turkish
tobacco
which
he
rolled
up
into
cigarettes
for
himself
was
the
first
devotee
of
this
habit
i
encountered
fairholt
in
his
book
on
tobacco
which
was
published
in
mentions
cigarettes
as
being
smoked
in
spain
and
south
and
central
america
but
makes
no
reference
to
their
use
in
this
country
the
late
lady
dorothy
nevill
said
that
although
cigarettes
are
a
modern
invention
she
believed
that
they
already
existed
in
a
slightly
different
form
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
when
old
peninsular
officers
used
to
smoke
tobacco
rolled
up
tight
in
a
piece
of
paper
they
called
this
a
and
i
fancy
it
was
much
the
same
thing
as
a
cigarette
but
if
this
were
so
the
habit
must
have
died
out
long
before
the
cigarette
as
we
now
know
it
came
into
vogue
it
may
fairly
be
concluded
i
think
that
although
about
there
may
have
been
an
occasional
in
england
like
the
edward
abbott
of
hyndman
reminiscences
yet
it
was
not
until
a
little
later
date
that
the
small
rolls
of
tobacco
became
at
all
common
among
englishmen
and
it
is
quite
likely
that
the
credit
or
discredit
as
the
reader
pleases
of
bringing
them
into
general
and
especially
into
fashionable
use
has
been
rightly
given
to
laurence
oliphant
cigarettes
were
perhaps
in
fashion
in
in
puck
which
was
published
in
that
year
ouida
who
is
hardly
an
unimpeachable
authority
on
the
ways
and
customs
of
fashionable
folk
though
she
loved
to
paint
fancy
pictures
of
their
sayings
and
doings

most
fashionable

it

years
or
more
ago
the
late
andrew
lang
wrote
an
article
entitled
enchanted
cigarettes
which
began
to
dream
our
literary
projects
balzac
says
is
like
enchanted
cigarettes
but
when
we
try
to
tackle
our
projects
to
make
them
real
the
enchantment
disappears
we
have
to
till
the
soil
to
sow
the
weed
to
gather
the
leaves
and
then
the
cigarettes
must
be
manufactured
while
there
may
be
no
market
for
them
after
all
probably
most
people
have
enjoyed
the
fragrance
of
these
cigarettes
and
have
brooded
over
much
which
they
will
never
put
on
paper
here

some
of
ashes
of
the
weeds
of
my

of

no

to

the
late
bishop
mandell
creighton
of

was
an
incessant
smoker
of

herbert
paul
in

on

bishop
says
that
those
who
went
to
see
him
at
fulham
on
a
sunday
afternoon
always
found
him
if
they
found
him
at
all
leisurely
chatty
hospitable
and
apparently
without
a
care
in

world
there
was
the

there
were

side
view
of
another
in
the
of
samuel
butler
the
author
of
erewhon
creighton
after
reading
butler
alps
and
sanctuaries
had
asked
the
author
to
come
and
see
him
butler
was
in
doubt
whether
or
not
to
go
and
consulted
his
clerk
alfred
on
the
matter
that
wise
counsellor
asked
to
look
at
the
bishop
letter
and
then
said
i
see
sir
there
is
a
crumb
of
tobacco
in
it
i
think
you
can
go
apart
from
however
the
use
of
tobacco
grew
steadily
during
the
later
victorian
period
in
for
there
was
a
burlesque
dialogue
between
uncle
and
nephew
entitled
cupid
and
the
uncle
thinks
the
younger
men
smoke
too
much
and
declares
that
tobacco
has
destroyed
the
susceptibility
which
in
my
time
made
youngsters
fall
in
love
as
they
often
did
with
a
girl
without
a
penny
no
fellow
can
fall
in
love
when
he
has
continually
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
if
he
ever
feels
inclined
to
when
it
would
be
imprudent
why
he
lights
his
pipe
and
very
soon
smokes
the
idea
of
such
folly
out
of
his
head
not
so
when
i
was
of
your
age
besides
a
few
old
farmers
churchwardens
and
overseers
and
such
nobody
then
ever
smoked
but
labourers
and
the
lower
orders
cads
as
you
now
say
smoking
was
thought
vulgar
young
men
never
smoked
at
all
to
smoke
in
the
presence
of
a
lady
was
an
inconceivable
outrage
yet
now
i
see
you
and
your
friends
walking
alongside
of
one
another
sisters
smoking
a
short
pipe
down
the
street
the
girls
like
it
says
nepos
in
my

ladies
would
have
fainted
at
the
bare

of
such
an
enormity
the

ends
as

in
the

one
of
the
ideals
of

by

to
approve
of

over
the
house
while
one
of
the
ideals
of
a
husband
by
a
spinster
is
not
to
smoke
or
use

prelections
of
course
are
not
to
be
taken
too
seriously
they
all
necessarily
have
the
exaggeration
of
caricature
but
at
the
same
time
they
are
all
significant
and
for
the
social
historian
are
invaluable
was
advancing
victoriously
all
along
the
line
absurd
old
conventions
and
ridiculous
restrictions
had
to
give

or
were
broken
through
in

direction
the

and
grudgingly
became
more
and
more
numerous
the
practice
of
smoking
out
of
doors
which
the
early
victorians
held
in
particular
abhorrence
became
common
at
least
so
far
as
cigars
and
cigarettes
were
concerned
lady
dorothy
nevill
whose
memory
covered
so
large
a
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
said
in
the
leaves
from
her
which
was
published
in
that
to
smoke
in
hyde
park
even
up
to
comparatively
recent
years
was
looked
upon
as
absolutely
unpardonable
while
smoking
anywhere
with
a
lady
would
in
the
earlier
days
have
been
classed
as
an
almost
disgraceful
social
crime
the
first
gentleman
of
whom
lady
dorothy
heard
as
having
been
seen
smoking
a
cigar
in
the
park
was
the
duke
of
sutherland
and
the
lady
who
told
her
spoke
of
it
as
if
she
had
been
present
at
an
earthquake
pipes
were
and
are
still
looked
at
askance
in
many
places
where
the
smoking
of
cigars
and
cigarettes
is
freely
allowed
and
fashion
frowned
on
the
pipe
in
street
or
park
of
course
what
one
might
do
in
the
country
and
what
one
might
do
in
town
were
two
quite
different
things
the
following
story
was
told
nearly
twenty
years
ago
of
the
late
duke
of
devonshire
an
american
tourist
began
talking
one
day
to
a
man
who
was
smoking
outside
an
inn
on
the
chatsworth
estate
and
taking
the
man
for
the
expressed
his
admiration
of
the
duke
of
domain
quite
a
place
is
it
said
the
american
yes
a
pleasant
place
enough
returned
the
englishman
the
fellow
who
owns
it
must
be
worth
a
mint
of
money
said
the
american
through
his
yes
he
comfortably
off
agreed
the
other
i
wonder
if
i
could
get
a
look
at
the
old
chap
said
the
stranger
after
a
short
silence
i
should
like
to
see
what
sort
of
a
bird
he
is
puff
puff
went
the
english
cigar
and
then
said
the
english
voice
trying
hard
to
control
itself
if
you
puff
look
hard
puff
puff
in
this
direction
you
puff
puff
can
tell
in
a
minute
you
you
faltered
the
american
getting
up
why
i
thought
you
were
the
landlord
well
so
i
am
said
the
duke
though
i
do
perform
the
duties
i
stay
here
he
added
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
to
be
looked
at
among
the
chief
strongholds
of
the
old
ideas
and
prejudices
were
some
of
the
clubs
at
the
athenæum

only
used
to
be
a
combined
in
the
basement
it
was
but
a
few
years
ago
that
an
attic
story
was
added
to
the
building

now
reach
more
comfortable
quarters

of
a

of

was
much
perturbation
the
older
members
bitterly
opposing
the
proposal
a
general
meeting
was
held
to
decide
the
question
says
ralph
nevill
in
his
london
clubs
when
a
number
of
old
gentlemen
who
had
not
been
seen
in

goes
on
in
burlesque
strain
to

of
the
joys
of

when
he
lies
in
idleness
by
the
streams
in
breathless
summer
comforted
by
a
bath
just
taken
or
when
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
is
worn
out
by
revising
endless

hastens
to

does
my
grand

sake
of
its
excellent
savour

the
many
sweet
smokes
of
the
past
my
pipe
keeps
its
hold
on
my
favour
tho
now
it
is
blackening
but
although
many
pipes
were
smoked
at
the
universities
there
were
occasionally
to
be
found
odd
survivals
of
old
prejudices
shipley
in
his
recent
memoir
of
john
willis
clark
the
cambridge
registrary
says
that
even
in
the
of
the
last
century
there
was
an
elderly
don
at
cambridge
who
once
rebuked
a
junior
fellow
who
was
smoking
a
pipe
in
the
wilderness
with
the
remark
no
christian
gentleman
smokes
a
pipe
or
if
he
does
he
smokes
a
cigar
the
perpetrator
of
this
bull
was
the
same
parson
who
married
late
in
life
and
returning
to
his
church
after
a
honeymoon
of
six
weeks
publicly
thanked
god
for
weeks
of
unalloyed
connubial
bliss

calverley
tobacco
is
once
more
triumphant
the
cycle
of
three
hundred
years
is
complete
since
the
early
decades
of
the
seventeenth
century
smoking
has
never
been
so
generally
practised
nor
so
smiled
upon
by
fashion
as
it
is
at
the
present
time
men
in
their
attitude
towards
tobacco
have
always
been
divisible
into
three
classes
those
who
respected
and
followed
and
obeyed
the
conventions
of
society
and
the
dictates
of
fashion
and
smoked
or
did
not
smoke
in
accordance
therewith
those
who
knew
those
conventions
but
disregarded
them
and
smoked
as
and
what
they
pleased
and
those
who
neither
knew
nor
cared
whether
such
conventions
existed
or
what
fashion
might
say
but
smoked
as
and
what
and
when
and
where
they
pleased
at
the
present
time
the
three
classes
tend
to
combine
into
one
there
are
it
is
true
a
few
conventions
and
restrictions
left
but
they
are
not
very
strong
and
will
probably
disappear
one
of
these
days
there
is
also
of
course
and
always
has
been
a
fourth
class
of
men
who
for
one
reason
or
another
quite
apart
from
what
fashion
may
say
or
do
do
not
smoke
at
all
perhaps
the
most
absurd
and
unmeaning
of
the
restrictions
that
remain
is
that
which
at
certain
times
and
in
certain
places
admits
the
smoking
of
cigars
and
cigarettes
and
forbids
the
smoking
of
pipes
the
idea
appears
to
be
that
a
pipe
is
vulgar
there
are
few
restaurants
now
in
which
smoking
is
not
allowed
after
dinner
but
the
understanding
is
that
cigars
and
cigarettes
only
shall
be
smoked
in
some
places
of
resort
there
are
notices
exhibited
which
specifically
prohibit
the
smoking
of
pipes
why
at
a
smoking
concert
where
few
pipes
are
smoked
anyone
looking
the
smoke
of
burning
can
at
once
realize
how
much
greater
is
the
volume
of
smoke
from
cigars
and
cigarettes
than
would
result
from
the
smoking
of
a
like
number
of
pipes
it
can
not
therefore
be
that
pipes
are
barred
because
of
a
supposed
greater
effect
upon
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
the
only
conclusion
the
observer
can
come
to
is
that
the
fashionable
attitude
towards
pipes
is
one
of
the
last
relics
of
the
old
social
attitude
the
attitude
of
georgian
and
early
victorian
days
towards
smoking
of
any
kind
the
cigar
and
the
cigarette
were
first
introduced
among
the
upper
classes
of
society
and
their
use
has
spread
downward
they
have
broken
down
many
barriers
and
in
many
places
and
under
many
and
divers
conditions
the
pipe
has
followed
triumphantly
in
their
wake
but
the
last
ditch
of
the
old
prejudice
has
been
found
in
the
convention
which
in
certain
places
and
at
certain
times
admits
the
cigar
and
cigarette
of
fashionable
origin
but
bars
the
entry
of
the
plebeian
pipe
the
pipe
which
for
two
centuries
was
practically
the
only
mode
of
smoking
used
or
known
an
article
which
appeared
in
the
of
february
may
be
regarded
as
a
sign
of
the
times
it
was
entitled
a
plea
for
the
pipe
by
one
who
smokes
it
i
should
like
said
the
writer
of
all
degrees
to
ask
themselves
whether
the
time
has
not
really
arrived
to
enter
a
protest
against
the
convention
which
forces
the
pipe
into
a
position
of
inferiority
and
exalts
to
a
pinnacle
of
undeserved
the
cigar
and
still
more
the
cigarette
why
should
it
be
considered
a
mark
of
vulgarity
of
plebeianism
to
inhale
through
the
stem
of
a
briar
and
the
of
good
breeding
to
finger
a
cigar
or
dally
with
that
triviality
and
travesty
of
the
adoration
of
my
lady
nicotine
a
cigarette
to
these
questions
there
can
be
but
one
answer
and
the
future
there
can
be
little
doubt
will
emphasize
that
answer
and
abolish
the
unmeaning
convention
the
prejudice
against
the
pipe
is
not
confined
to
places
of
indoor
resort
there
are
many
men
who
smoke
pipes
within
doors
who
yet
would
not
care
to
be
seen
in
london
smoking
a
pipe
in
the
street
or
in
the
park
in
some
circumstances
this
is
quite
intelligible
the
writer
of
the
article
remarked
with
much
force
and
good
sense
that
apart
from
social
environment
there
is
a
certain
affinity
between
pipes
and
clothes
it
is
considered
form
for
a
man
in
a
and
silk
hat
to
be
seen
smoking
a
pipe
in
the
streets
if
you
are
wearing
a
bowler
hat
and
a
lounge
suit
you
may
walk
along
with
a
briar
protruding
from
your
lips
and
no
one
will
think
ill
of
you
if
you
are
a
son
of
toil
garbed
in
your
habit
as
you
work
there
is
nothing
incongruous
in
a
clay
or
a
which
for
convenience
you
carry
upside
down
not
so
very
long
ago
it
was
considered
unseemly
to
smoke
a
pipe
at
all
in
the
street
unless
you
belonged
to
the
humbler
orders
who
inhale
their
nicotine
through
the
stem
of
a
clay
and
expectorate
with
a
greater
sense
of
freedom
than
of
responsibility
at
a
few
clubs
there
are
still
some
curious
and
rather
unmeaning
restrictions
a
particularly
absurd
rule
that
maintains
its
ground
here
and
there
is
that
which
forbids
smoking
in
the
library
of
a
club
what
more
appropriate
place
could
there
be
for
the
thoughtful
consumption
of
tobacco
than
among
the
books
but
after
due
allowance
has
been
made
for
a
few
minor
restrictions
of
this
kind
the
fact
remains
that
smoking
has
triumphed
socially
all
along
the
line
in
clubland
we
have
travelled
far
from
the
days
when
a
committee
man
could
declare
that
no
gentleman
smoked
to
the
time
when
for
example
the
large
at
brooks
is
one
of
the
finest
rooms
in
one
of
the
most
famous
and
exclusive
of
clubs
this
splendid
room
in
the
days
of
gambling
was
the
grand
subscription
room
the
gambling
room
of
georgian
times
it
still
retains
two
of
the
old
gaming
tables
now
this
magnificent
apartment
with
its
splendid
barrelled
ceiling
which
a
architectural
writer
stanley
ramsey
describes
as
probably
the
finest
room
of
its
kind
in
london
is
the
temple
of
saint
nicotine
the
strangers
in
the
same
club
formerly
the
is
another
beautiful
and
delightfully
decorated
apartment
similar
transformations
have
been
witnessed
in
other
clubs
barry
original
plan
for
the
travellers
club
erected
in
shows
no
on
the
ground
floor
it
was
probably
some
inconvenient
apartment
of
no
account
the
early
travellers
did
smoke
for
theodore
hook
satirizing
them
and
the
club
rule
that
no
person
was
eligible
as
a
member
who
had
not
travelled
out
of
the
british
islands
to
a
distance
of
at
least
miles
from
london
in
a
direct
line

in

mall
and
smoke
cigars
so
cosily
and
dream
they
climb
the
highest
alps
or
rove
the
plains
of
moselai
the
world
for
them
has
nothing
new
they
have
explored
all
parts
of
it
and
now
they
are
and
they
sit
and
look
at

the
front
to
the
gardens
of
carlton
house

and
is
divided
into
three
bays
by
the
projection
of
square
piers
another
sign
of
the
complete
change
which
has
come
over
the
attitude
of
most
folk
towards
tobacco
is
to
be
seen
in
the
permission
of
smoking
at
meetings
of
committees
and
councils
where
not
so
long
ago
such
an
indulgence
would
have
been
regarded
as
an
outrage
many
of
the
committees
of
municipal
councils
and
other
public
bodies
now
permit
smoking
while
business
is
proceeding
it
has
even
become
usual
for
members
of
the
house
of
commons
to
smoke
in
committee
rooms
when
the
sitting
is
private
and
cigars
and
cigarettes
and
pipes
are
now
lighted
in
the
lobby
the
moment
that
the
house
has
risen
a
very
thin
line
thus
separates
the
legislative
chamber
itself
from
the
conquering
weed
a
further
step
forward
or
backward
according
to
each
judgment
was
taken
on
july
when
smoking
was
allowed
at
the
sitting
of
the
standing
committee
on
scottish
bills
one
of
the
committees
which
does
not
conduct
its
business
in
private
on
this
occasion
after
the
luncheon
interval
two
members
entered
the
committee
room
smoking
one
a
cigarette
the
other
a
cigar
the
former
was
soon
finished
but
the
latter
continued
to
shed
its
fragrance
on
the
room
naturally
the
chairman
arthur
henderson
was
appealed
to
he
gave
a
diplomatic
reply
it
had
been
held
he
said
by
two
chairmen
that
smoking
was
not
in
order
at
the
public
sessions
of
a
standing
committee
and
of
course
if
his
ruling
were
formally
asked
he
would
be
bound
to
follow
precedent
he
said
this
with
a
suavity
and
a
smile
which
disarmed
any
possible
objector
nobody
raised
the
formal
point
of
order
so
other
members
lighted
up
and
the
proceedings
went
on
peacefully
to
the
appointed
hour
of
closing
yet
another
sign
of
the
times
was
the
permission
given
not
so
very
long
ago
to
the
drivers
of
to
smoke
while
driving
fares
a
development
regarding
which
there
may
well
be
two
opinions
the
number
of
nowadays
is
legion
but
to
a
very
large
number
of
tobacconists
in
the
old
sense
of
the
word
a
pipe
remains
the
most
satisfactory
of
smokes
a
cigar
or
a
cigarette
is
and
it
is
not
the
pipe
renders
its
service
again
and
again
and
yet
remains
a
steadfast
companion
over
a
pipe
is
a
phrase
of
more
meaning
than
over
a
cigarette
discussions
are
best
conducted
over
a
pipe
no
one
can
get
too
excited
or
in
argument
no
one
can
neglect
the
observance
of
the
amenities
of
conversation
who
talks
thoughtfully
between
the
pulls
at
his
pipe
who
has
to
pause
now
and
again
to
refill
to
strike
a
light
to
knock
out
the
ashes
or
to
perform
one
of
those
numberless
little
acts
of
devotion
at
the
shrine
of
nicotine
which
fill
up
the
pauses
and
conduce
to
reflection
the
indians
were
wise
in
their
generation
when
they
made
the
circulation
of
the
pipe
an
essential
part
of
their
a
conference
founded
on
the
mutual
consumption
of
tobacco
was
likely
not
as
the
frivolous
would
say
to
end
in
smoke
but
to
lead
to
solid
and
lasting
results
the
fact
is
squire
said
sam
slick
the
moment
a
man
takes
a
pipe
he
becomes
a
philosopher
the
pipe
says
thackeray
draws
wisdom
from
the
lips
of
the
philosopher
and
shuts
up
the
mouth
of
the
foolish
it
generates
a
style
of
conversation
contemplative
thoughtful
benevolent
and
unaffected
may
i
die
if
i
abuse
that
kindly
weed
which
has
given
me
so
much
pleasure
and
what
more
fitting
emblem
of
peace
could
be
chosen
than
the
calumet
the
proffered
pipe
tobacco
whatever
its
enemies
may
have
said
or
may
yet
say
is
the
friend
of
peace
the
foe
of
strife
and
the
promoter
of
geniality
and
good
fellowship
battle
whose
serious
energies
were
all
given
to
the
great
game
of
whist
unbent
her
mind
we
are
told
over
a
book
most
men
unbend
over
a
pipe
even
if
the
book
is
an
accompaniment
to
the
solitary
man
the
tube
is
an
invaluable
companion
if
he
happen
once
in
a
way
to
have
nothing
special
to
do
and
plenty
of
time
in
which
to
do
it
he
naturally
fills
his
pipe
as
he
draws
the
on
to
the
hearthrug
and
knows
not
that
he
is
lonely
if
he
have
a
difficult
problem
to
solve
he
just
as
naturally
attacks
it
over
a
pipe
it
is
true
that
as
the
ring
themselves
above
his
head
his
mind
may
wander
off
into
devious
paths
of
reverie
and
the
problem
be
utterly
forgotten
well
that
is
at
least
something
for
which
to
be
grateful
for
the
paths
of
reverie
are
the
paths
of
pleasantness
and
peace
and
problems
can
usually
afford
to
wait
over
a
pipe
why
the
words
bring
up
innumerable
pleasant
associations
the
angler
having
caught
the
coveted
prize
refills
his
pipe
and
with
the
satisfied
sense
of
duty
done
as
the
rings
curl
upward
he
reviews
the
struggle
and
glows
again
with
victory
at
the
end
of
any
day
occupation
especially
one
of
pleasurable
toil
whether
it
be
shooting
or
hunting
or
walking
or
what
not
what
can
be
pleasanter
than
to
let
the
mind
meander
through
the
course
of
the
day
proceedings
over
a
pipe
there
is
much
wisdom
in
robert
louis
stevenson
remarks
in
virginibus
puerisque
lastly
and
this
is
perhaps
the
golden
rule
no
woman
should
marry
a
teetotaller
or
a
man
who
does
not
smoke
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
this
tabagie
as
michelet
calls
it
spreads
over
all
the
world
michelet
rails
against
it
because
it
renders
you
happy
apart
from
thought
or
work
to
provident
women
this
will
seem
no
evil
influence
in
married
life
whatever
keeps
a
man
in
the
front
garden
whatever
checks
wandering
fancy
and
all
inordinate
ambition
whatever
makes
for
lounging
and
contentment
makes
just
so
surely
for
domestic
happiness
nothing
is
more
marked
in
the
change
in
the
social
attitude
towards
tobacco
than
the
revolution
which
has
taken
place
in
woman
view
of
smoking
the
history
of
smoking
by
women
is
dealt
with
separately
in
the
next
chapter
but
here
it
may
be
noted
that
most
of
the
old
intolerance
of
tobacco
has
disappeared
to
smoke
in
hyde
park
said
the
late
lady
dorothy
nevill
in
even
up
to
comparatively
recent
years
was
looked
upon
as
absolutely
unpardonable
while
smoking
anywhere
with
a
lady
would
have
been
classed
as
an
almost
disgraceful
social
crime
women
do
not
nowadays
shun
the
smell
of
smoke
as
they
did
in
early
victorian
days
as
if
it
were
the
most
dreadful
of
odours
they
are
tolerant
of
smoking
in
their
presence
in
public
places
in
restaurants
in
fact
wherever
men
and
women
congregate
to
a
degree
that
would
have
horrified
extremely
their
mothers
and
grandmothers
it
is
only
within
the
last
few
years
that
visits
to
and
theatres
of
varieties
have
been
socially
possible
to
ladies
men
go
largely
because
they
can
smoke
during
the
performance
women
go
largely
because
they
have
ceased
to
consider
as
a
thing
to
be
rigidly
avoided
and
therefore
have
no
hesitation
in
accompanying
their
menfolk
the
observant
visitor
to
the
promenade
concerts
annually
given
in
the
queen
hall
langham
place
will
notice
that
but
one
small
section
of
the
grand
circle
is
reserved
for
while
smoking
is
freely
allowed
with
no
absurd
ban
on
the
friendly
pipe
in
every
other
part
of
the
great
auditorium
floor
circle
and
balcony
there
are
still
some
people
who
share
the
duke
of
delusion
that
smoking
promotes
drinking
although
experience
proves
the
contrary
and
historic
evidence
especially
as
regards
drinking
after
dinner
shows
that
it
was
the
introduction
of
the
cigar
followed
by
that
of
the
cigarette
which
absolutely
killed
the
old
bad
habits
the
salvation
army
do
not
enforce
total
abstinence
from
tobacco
as
well
as
from
alcoholic
drinks
as
a
condition
of
membership
or
soldiership
but
a
member
of
the
army
must
be
a
before
he
can
hold
any
office
in
its
rank
or
be
a
bandsman
or
a
member
of
a
songster
brigade
and
in
other
religious
organizations
there
are
yet
a
few
of
the
unco
guid
who
look
askance
at
pipe
or
cigarette
as
if
it
were
a
device
of
the
devil
but
the
numbers
of
these
misguided
folk
become
fewer
every
year
smoking
in
the
after
dinner
is
now
so
general
that
people
are
apt
to
forget
that
this
particular
development
is
of
no
great
age
it
is
not
yet
however
universal
a
valued
correspondent
tells
me
that
he
knows
a
house
where
tobacco
is
still
kept
out
of
the
and
smoke
indulged
in
elsewhere
after
wine
this
habit
must
now
be
pretty
rare
the
chief
legitimate
objection
to
cigarette
smoking
was
well
stated
some
years
ago
by
the
late
andrew
wilson
i
think
cigarettes
are
apt
to
prove
injurious
he
said
because
a
man
will
smoke
far
too
much
when
he
indulges
in
this
form
of
the
weed
and
because
i
think
it
is
generally
admitted
that
cigarettes
are
apt
to
produce
evil
effects
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
amount
of
tobacco
which
is
apparently
consumed
excess
can
equally
be
found
among
cigar
and
the
late
chancellor
parish
in
his
dictionary
of
the
sussex
dialect
tells
a
delightful
story
of
a
sussex
rustic
holiday
may
be
you
knows
mass
master
the
distinctive
title
of
a
married
labourer
pilbeam
no
doänt
ye
well
he
was
a
very
marn
was
mass
pilbeam
a
very
marn
he
says
to
he
mistus
one
day
he
says
is
a
long
time
says
he
sence
i
took
a
holiday
so
cardenly
nex
marnin
he
laid
abed
till
purty
nigh
seven
and
then
he
brackfustes
and
then
he
goos
down
to
the
shop
and
buys
fower
ounces
of
barca
and
he
sets
hisself
down
on
the
maxon
manure
heap
and
there
he
set
and
there
he
smoked
and
smoked
and
smoked
all
the
whole
day
long
for
says
he
is
a
long
time
sence
i
had
a
holiday
ah
he
was
a
very
marn
a
very
marn
indeed
some
men
seem
to
act
upon
mark
twain
principle
of
never
smoking
when
asleep
or
at
meals
and
never
refraining
at
any
other
time
but
excess
is
there
is
no
good
reason
why
anyone
for
social
or
any
other
reasons
should
look
askance
at
the
reasonable
use
of
tobacco
but
used
in
moderation
what
evils
let
me
ask
i
again
quote
andrew
wilson
calm
good
sense
are
to
be
found
in
the
train
of
the
a
man
does
get
delirium
tremens
even
if
he
smokes
more
than
is
good
for
him
he
does
become
a
debased
mortal
there
is
nothing
about
tobacco
which
makes
a
man
beat
his
wife
or
assault
his
rather
the
reverse
in
fact
for
tobacco
is
a
soother
and
a
quietener
of
the
passions
and
many
a
man
i
daresay
has
been
prevented
from
doing
rash
things
in
the
way
of
retaliation
when
he
has
lit
his
pipe
and
had
a
good
think
over
his
affairs
whenever
anybody
counterblasts
against
tobacco
i
feel
as
did
my
old
friend
wilkie
collins
when
somebody
told
him
that
to
smoke
was
a
wrong
thing
dear
sir
said
the
great
novelist
your
objections
to
tobacco
only
increase
the
relish
with
which
i
look
forward
to
my
next
cigar
xiii
smoking
by
women
ladies
when
pipes
are
brought
affect
to
swoon
they
love
no
smoke
except
the
smoke
of
town
isaac
hawkins
browne
a
story
is
told
of
sir
walter
raleigh
by
john
aubrey
which
seems
to
imply
that
at
first
women
not
only
did
not
smoke
but
that
they
disliked
smoking
by
men
aubrey
says
that
raleigh
standing
in
a
stand
at
sir
poyntz
parke
at
acton
tooke
a
pipe
of
tobacco
which
made
the
ladies
quitt
it
till
he
had
done
but
this
objection
whether
general
or
not
soon
vanished
for
as
we
have
seen
in
a
previous
chapter
the
gallant
of
elizabethan
and
jacobean
days
made
a
practice
of
smoking
in
his
lady
presence
it
seems
certain
moreover
that
some
women
at
least
smoked
very
soon
after
the
introduction
of
tobacco
but
it
is
not
easy
to
find
direct
evidence
though
there
are
sundry
traditions
and
allusions
which
suggest
that
the
practice
was
not
unknown
there
is
a
tradition
that
queen
elizabeth
herself
once
smoked
with
unpleasant
results
campbell
in
his
history
of
virginia
says
that
raleigh
having
offered
her
majesty
some
tobacco
to
smoke
after
two
or
three
whiffs
she
was
seized
with
a
nausea
upon
observing
which
some
of
the
earl
of
leicester
faction
whispered
that
sir
walter
had
certainly
poisoned
her
but
her
majesty
in
a
short
while
recovering
made
the
countess
of
nottingham
and
all
her
maids
smoke
a
whole
pipe
out
among
them
the
queen
had
no
selfish
desire
to
monopolize
the
novel
sensations
caused
by
smoking
an
writer
oldys
in
his
life
of
sir
walter
raleigh
declares
that
tobacco
soon
became
of
such
vogue
in
queen
elizabeth
court
that
some
of
the
great
ladies
as
well
as
noblemen
therein
would
not
scruple
to
take
a
pipe
sometimes
very
sociably
but
these
stories
rest
on
vague
tradition
and
probably
have
no
foundation
in
fact
king
james
i
in
his
famous
to
tobacco
hinted
that
the
husband
by
his
indulgence
in
the
habit
might
reduce
thereby
his
delicate
wholesome
and
cleane
complexioned
wife
to
that
extremitie
that
either
shee
must
also
corrupt
her
sweete
breath
therewith
or
else
resolve
to
live
in
a
perpetuall
stinking
torment
his
style
was
forcible
if
not
elegant
there
are
also
one
or
two
references
in
the
early
dramatists
in
ben
jonson
every
man
in
his
humour
for
instance
which
was
first
acted
in
six
years
before
king
james
blew
his
royal
cob
the
says
that
he
would
have
any
man
or
woman
that
should
but
deal
with
a
immediately
whipped
prynne
in
his
attack
on
the
stage
declared
that
women
smoked
pipes
in
theatres
but
the
truth
of
this
statement
may
well
be
doubted
the
habit
was
probably
far
from
general
among
women
although
joshua
sylvester
a
doughty
opponent
of
the
weed
was
pleased
to
declare
that
fooles
of
all
sexes
haunt
it
tobacco
the
ballads
of
the
period
abound
in
rough
woodcuts
in
which
tavern
scenes
are
often
figured
wherein
pewter
pots
and
are
shown
lying
on
the
table
or
in
the
hands
or
at
the
mouths
of
the
male
carousers
men
and
women
are
figured
together
but
it
would
be
very
hard
to
find
a
woman
in
one
of
these
rough
cuts
with
a
pipe
in
her
hand
or
at
her
mouth
an
example
in
the
shirburn
ballads
lies
before
me
the
cut
which
is
very
rough
heads
a
bacchanalian
ballad
characteristic
of
the
elizabethan
period
called
a
knotte
of
good
fellows
and
beginning
hither
mine
host
come
hither
come
hither
mine
host
come
hither
i
pray
thee
mine
host
give
us
a
pot
and
a
tost
and
let
us
drinke
all
the
scene
is
a
tavern
interior
around
the
table
are
four
men
and
a
woman
while
a
boy
approaches
carrying
two
huge
measures
of
ale
one
man
is
smoking
furiously
while
on
the
table
lie
three
other
pipes
one
for
each
man
and
sundry
pots
and
glasses
the
woman
is
plainly
a
convivial
soul
but
there
is
no
pipe
for
her
and
such
provision
was
no
doubt
unusual
there
is
direct
evidence
too
besides
the
story
in
the
first
paragraph
of
this
chapter
that
women
disliked
the
prevalence
of
smoking
in
marston
antonio
and
mellinda
rosaline
when
asked
by
her
uncle
when
she
will
marry
makes
the
spirited
reply
faith
kind
uncle
when
men
abandon
jealousy
forsake
taking
of
tobacco
and
cease
to
wear
their
beards
so
rudely
long
oh
to
have
a
husband
with
a
mouth
continually
smoking
with
a
bush
of
furs
on
the
ridge
of
his
chin
readie
still
to
flop
into
his
foaming
chops
is
more
than
most
intolerable
and
similar
indications
of
dislike
to
smoking
could
be
quoted
from
other
plays
on
the
other
hand
it
is
certain
that
from
comparatively
early
in
the
seventeenth
century
there
were
to
be
found
here
and
there
women
who
smoked
on
the
of
middleton
comedy
the
roaring
girle
is
a
picture
of
the
heroine
moll
cutpurse
in
man
apparel
smoking
a
pipe
from
which
a
great
cloud
of
smoke
is
issuing
in
the
record
of
an
early
libel
action
brought
in
the
court
of
the
archdeacon
of
essex
some
domestic
scenes
of
are
vividly
represented
we
need
not
trouble
about
the
libel
action
but
two
of
the
were
a
certain
george
thresher
who
sold
beer
and
tobacco
at
his
shopp
in
romford
and
a
good
friend
and
customer
of
his
named
elizabeth
savage
who
sad
to
say
was
described
as
much
given
to
stronge
drincke
and
tobacco
in
the
course
of
the
trial
on
june
mistress
savage
had
to
tell
her
tale
part
of
which
is
reported
as
follows
george
thresher
kept
a
shoppe
in
romford
and
sold
tobacco
there
she
came
divers
tymes
to
his
shoppe
to
buy
tobacco
there
and
sometimes
with
company
of
her
acquaintance
did
take
tobacco
and
drincke
beere
in
the
hall
of
george
thresher
house
sometimes
with
the
said
george
and
sometimes
with
his
father
and
his
brothers
and
sometimes
shee
hath
had
a
joint
of
meat
and
a
cople
of
chickens
dressed
there
and
shee
and
they
and
some
other
of
her
freinds
have
dined
there
together
and
paid
their
share
for
their
dinner
shee
being
many
times
more
willing
to
dine
there
than
at
an
inne
or
taverne
elizabeth
was
evidently
of
a
sociable
turn
and
though
she
turned
her
nose
up
at
a
tavern
there
seems
to
have
been
little
difference
between
these
festive
dinners
at
thresher
shopp
where
mistress
savage
indulged
her
taste
for
ale
and
tobacco
and
similar
pleasures
at
an
inn
or
tavern
some
of
the
references
to
women
smokers
occur
in
curious
connexions
when
one
george
glapthorne
of
whittlesey
was
returned
to
parliament
for
the
isle
of
ely
in
his
return
was
petitioned
against
and
among
other
charges
it
was
said
that
just
before
the
election
in
a
certain
martin
he
had
promised
to
give
martin
a
roll
of
tobacco
and
had
also
undertaken
to
grant
her
husband
a
licence
to
brew
thus
unduly
influencing
and
corrupting
the
electors
women
smokers
were
not
confined
to
any
one
class
of
society
the
rev
giles
moore
rector
of
horsted
keynes
sussex
made
a
note
in
his
journal
and
account
book
in
of
tobacco
for
my
wyfe
as
from
other
entries
in
moore
account
book
we
know
that
two
ounces
cost
him
one
shilling
we
may
wonder
what
moore
was
going
to
do
with
her
there
is
no
other
reference
to
tobacco
for
her
in
the
journal
and
account
book
possibly
she
was
not
a
smoker
at
all
but
needed
the
tobacco
for
some
medicinal
purpose
there
is
ample
evidence
to
show
that
in
the
seventeenth
century
extraordinary
medicinal
virtues
continued
to
be
attributed
to
the
divine
weed
in
some
letters
of
the
appleton
family
printed
some
time
ago
from
the
originals
in
the
bodleian
library
there
is
a
curious
letter
undated
but
of
or
from
susan
crane
the
widow
of
sir
robert
crane
who
was
the
second
wife
of
isaac
appleton
of
buckman
vall
norfolk
writing
to
her
husband
isaac
appleton
at
his
chamber
in
grayes
inn
as
his
afextinat
wife
the
good
susan
whose
spelling
is
marvellous
tells
her
sweet

i

all
the
tobakcre
you
left
mee
i
pray
send
mee
sum
this
weeke
and
some
angelleco
ceedd
and
sum
cerret
sed
how
much
tobacco
appleton
had
provisioned
his
wife
with
can
not
be
known
but
it
looks
as
if
she
were
a
regular
smoker
and
did
not
care
to
be
long
without
a
supply
in
edmond
howes
who
edited
stow
chronicles
and
continued
them
onto
the
end
of
this
present
yeare
wrote
that
tobacco
was
at
this
day
commonly
used
by
most
men
and
many
women
anything
like
general
smoking
by
women
in
the
seventeenth
century
would
appear
to
have
been
confined
to
certain
parts
of
the
country
celia
fiennes
who
travelled
about
england
on
horseback
in
the
reign
of
william
and
mary
tells
us
that
at
austell
in
cornwall
austins
she
calls
it
she
disliked
the
custome
of
the
country
which
is
a
universal
smoaking
both
men
women
and
children
have
all
their
pipes
of
tobacco
in
their
mouths
and
soe
sit
round
the
fire
smoaking
which
was
not
delightful
to
me
when
i
went
down
to
talk
with
my
landlady
for
information
of
any
matter
and
customes
amongst
them
what
would
king
james
have
thought
of
these
depraved
cornish
folk
other
witnesses
bear
testimony
to
the
prevalence
of
smoking
among
women
in
the
west
of
england
dunton
in
that
which
was
a
kind
of
early
forerunner
of
and
alluded
to
by
the
good
women
and
children
in
the
west
misson
the
french
traveller
who
was
here
in
after
remarking
that
tabacco
is
very
much
used
in
england
says
that
the
very
women
take
it
in
abundance
particularly
in
the
western
counties
but
why
the
women
what
occasion
is
there
for
that
we
wonder
that
in
certain
places
it
should
be
common
for
women
to
take
tabacco
and
why
should
we
wonder
at
it
the
women
of
devonshire
and
cornwall
wonder
that
the
women
of
middlesex
do
take
tabacco
and
why
should
they
wonder
at
it
in
truth
our
wonderments
are
very
pleasant
things
and
with
that
sage
and
satisfactory
conclusion
to
his
catechism
we
may
leave
misson
though
he
goes
on
to
philosophize
about
the
effect
of
smoking
by
the
english
clergy
upon
their
theology
another
french
visitor
to
our
shores
jorevin
whose
rare
book
of
travels
was
published
at
paris
in
was
wandering
in
the
west
of
england
about
the
year
and
in
the
course
of
his
journey
stayed
at
the
stag
inn
at
worcester
where
he
found
he
had
to
make
himself
quite
at
home
with
the
family
of
his
hostess
he
tells
us
that
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
the
landladies
sup
with
strangers
and
passengers
and
if
they
have
daughters
these
also
are
of
the
company
to
entertain
the
guests
at
table
with
pleasant
conceits
where
they
drink
as
much
as
the
men
but
what
quite
disgusted
our
visitor
was
that
when
one
drinks
the
health
of
any
person
in
company
the
custom
of
the
country
does
not
permit
you
to
drink
more
than
half
the
cup
which
is
filled
up
and
presented
to
him
or
her
whose
health
you
have
drunk
moreover
the
supper
being
finished
they
set
on
the
table
half
a
dozen
pipes
and
a
packet
of
tobacco
for
smoking
which
is
a
general
custom
as
well
among
women
as
men
who
think
that
without
tobacco
one
can
not
live
in
england
because
say
they
it
dissipates
the
evil
humours
of
the
brain
although
according
to
misson
the
women
of
devon
and
cornwall
might
wonder
why
the
women
of
middlesex
did
not
take
tobacco
it
is
certain
that
london
and
its
neighbourhood
did
contain
at
least
a
few
female
smokers
tom
brown
often
dubbed
the
facetious
but
to
whom
a
sterner
epithet
might
well
be
applied
writing
about
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
mentions
a
vintner
wife
who
having
made
her
pile
as
might
be
said
nowadays
retires
to
a
little
at
hampstead
where
she
drinks
sack
too
plentifully
smokes
tobacco
in
an
and
snores
away
the
remainder
of
her
life
and
the
same
writer
was
responsible
for
a
satirical
letter
to
an
old
lady
that
smoak
tobacco
which
shows
that
the
practice
was
not
general
for
the
letter
begins
madam
tho
the
world
censures
you
for
smoaking
brown
advised
her
to
continue
the
innocent
diversion
because
first
it
was
good
for
the
toothache
the
constant
persecutor
of
old
ladies
and
secondly
it
was
a
great
help
to
meditation
which
is
the
reason
i
suppose
he
continues
that
recommends
it
to
your
parsons
the
generality
of
whom
can
no
more
write
a
sermon
without
a
pipe
in
their
mouths
than
a
concordance
in
their
hands
from
the
evidence
so
far
adduced
it
may
fairly
be
concluded
i
think
that
during
the
seventeenth
century
smoking
was
not
fashionable
or
indeed
anything
but
rare
among
the
women
of
the
more
classes
while
among
women
of
humbler
rank
it
was
an
occasional
and
in
a
few
districts
a
fairly
general
habit
the
same
conclusion
holds
good
for
the
eighteenth
century
among
women
of
the
lowest
class
smoking
was
probably
common
enough
in
amelia
a
woman
of
the
lowest
character
is
spoken
of
as
smoking
tobacco
drinking
punch
talking
obscenely
and
swearing
and
cursing
which
accomplishments
are
all
carefully
noted
because
none
of
them
would
be
applicable
to
the
ordinary
respectable
female
the
fine
lady
disliked
tobacco
the
author
of
a
pipe
of
tobacco
in
dodsley
collection
to
which
reference
has
already
been
made
wrote
when
pipes
are
brought
affect
to
swoon
they
love
no
smoke
except
the
smoke
of
town
citronia
vows
it
has
an
odious
stink
she
will
not
smoke
ye
gods
but
she
will
drink
and
the
same
writer
describes
tobacco
as
by
ladies
hated
hated
by
the
beaux
although
the
fine
lady
may
have
affected
to
swoon
at
the
sight
of
pipes
and
belles
generally
like
the
beaux
may
have
disdained
tobacco
as
vulgar
yet
there
were
doubtless
still
to
be
found
here
and
there
respectable
women
who
occasionally
indulged
in
a
smoke
in
an
early
addison
gives
the
rules
of
a
twopenny
club
erected
in
this
place
for
the
preservation
of
friendship
and
good
neighbourhood
which
met
in
a
little
and
was
frequented
by
artisans
and
mechanics
rule
ii
was
every
member
shall
fill
his
pipe
out
of
his
own
box
and
rule
vii
was
if
any
member
brings
his
wife
into
the
club
he
shall
pay
for
whatever
she
drinks
or
smokes
in
one
of
the
valuable
volumes
issued
by
the
georgian
society
of
dublin
a
year
or
two
ago
mahaffy
writing
on
the
century
society
of
the
irish
capital
quotes
an
advertisement
by
a
dublin
tobacconist
of
mild
pigtail
for
ladies
which
suggests
the
alarming
question
did
irish
ladies
chew
it
has
sometimes
been
supposed
that
the
companion
of
swift
stella
rebecca
dingley
was
addicted
to
smoking
in
the
letters
which
make
up
the
famous
journal
to
stella
there
are
several
references
by
swift
to
the
presents
of
tobacco
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
sending
to
dingley
on
september
he
wrote
i
have
the
finest
piece
of
brazil
tobacco
for
dingley
that
ever
was
born
in
the
following
month
he
again
had
a
great
piece
of
brazil
tobacco
for
the
same
lady
and
again
in
november
i
have
made
delaval
promise
to
send
me
some
brazil
tobacco
from
portugal
for
you
madam
dingley
in
december
swift
was
expressing
his
hope
that
dingley
tobacco
had
not
spoiled
the
chocolate
which
he
had
sent
for
stella
in
the
same
parcel
and
three
months
later
he
wrote
no
news
of
your
box
i
hope
you
have
it
and
are
this
minute
drinking
the
chocolate
and
that
the
smell
of
the
brazil
tobacco
has
not
affected
it
the
explanation
of
all
this
tobacco
for
mistress
dingley
is
to
be
found
in
swift
letter
to
stella
of
october
then
there
the
miscellany
he
writes
an
apron
for
stella
a
pound
of
chocolate
without
sugar
for
stella
a
fine
of
ivory
given
me
by
john
for
dingley
and
a
large
roll
of
tobacco
which
she
must
hide
or
cut
shorter
out
of
modesty
and
four
pair
of
spectacles
for
the
lord
knows
who
the
tobacco
was
clearly
not
for
smoking
but
for
dingley
to
operate
upon
with
the
and
so
supply
herself
with
snuff
a
luxury
which
in
those
days
was
as
much
enjoyed
and
as
universally
used
by
women
as
by
men
even
quakeresses
sometimes
smoked

of

in

is
still
extant
in
those
days
atlantic
passages
were
long
and
might
last
for
an
indefinite
period
and
passengers
provisioned
themselves
accordingly
on
this
occasion
the
passage
though
stormy
was
very
quick
for
it
lasted
only
days
the
list
of
provisions
taken
is
truly
formidable
it
includes
all
sorts
of
eatables
and
drinkables
in
astonishing
quantities
the

the
history
of
smoking
by
women
through
victorian
days
need
not
detain
us
long
there
have
always
been
among
the
women
of
the
poorer
classes
up
to
the
middle
of
the
last
century
smoking
was
very
common
among
the
women
of
northumberland
and
the
scottish
border
nor
has
the
practice
by
any
means
yet
died
out
in
may
a
woman
who
was
charged
with
drunkenness
at
the
west
ham
police
court
laid
the
blame
for
her
condition
on
her
pipe
she
said
she
had
smoked
it
for
twenty
years
and
it
always
makes
me
giddy
the
writer
in
august
saw
a
woman
seated
by
the
roadside
in
county
down
ireland
calmly
smoking
a
large
briar
pipe
it
is
not
so
very
long
ago
that
an
english
traveller
heard
a
courteously
ask
a
scottish
who
had
entered
a
of
the
train
whether
she
objected
to
smoking
the
good
woman
slowly
produced
a
cutty
pipe
and
as
she
began
to
cut
up
a
fill
from
a
tobacco
replied
na
na
laddie
i
come
in

for
a

of
jane
garbutt
widow
garbutt
had
been
twice
married
her

having
been
sailors
during
the
napoleonic
wars
the
old
woman
said
the
journal
had
dwindled
into
a
small
compass
but
she
was
free
from
pain
retaining
all
her
faculties
to
the
last
and
enjoying
her
pipe
about
a
year
ago
the
writer
of
this
notice
paid
her
a
visit
and
took
her
as
a
a
present
of
tobacco
which
ingredient
of
bliss
was
always
acceptable
from
her
visitors
asking
of
her
the
question
how
long
she
had
smoked
her
reply
was
nigh
a
hundred
years
in
there
died
at
buxton
at
the
age
of
a
woman
named
pheasy
molly
who
had
been
for
many
years
an
inveterate
smoker
her
death
was
caused
by
the
accidental
ignition
of
her
clothes
as
she
was
lighting
her
pipe
at
the
fire
she
had
burned
herself
more
than
once
before
in
performing
the
same
operation
but
her
pipe
she
was
bound
to
have
and
so
met
her
end
the
old
irishwomen
who
were
once
a
familiar
feature
of
london
as
sellers
of
apples
and
other
small
wares
at
street
corners
were
often
hardened
smokers
and
so
were
and
doubtless
still
are
many
of
the
gipsy
women
who
tramp
the
country
an
old
seven
dials
ballad
has
the
following
choice
stanza
first
i
saw
miss
bailey
was
on
a
saturday
at
the
corner
pin
she
was
drinking

smoking

up
to
about
the
middle
of
queen
victoria
reign
female
smoking
in
the
nineteenth
century
in
england
may
be
said
to
have
been
pretty
well
confined
to
women
of
the
classes
and
type
already
mentioned
respectable
folk
in
the
middle
and
upper
classes
would
have
been
horrified
at
the
idea
of
a
pipe
or
a
cigar
between
feminine
lips
and
cigarettes
had
been
used
by
men
for
a
long
time
before
it
began
to
be
whispered
that
here
and
there
a
lady
who
was
usually
considered
dreadfully
fast
for
her
pains
was
accustomed
to
venture
upon
a

related
in

life
of

which
shows
how
entirely
unknown
was
smoking
among

of

classes
in
england
some
ten
years
after

daughter
both
english
who
admired
him
greatly
and
whom
he
had
previously
known
at
genoa
the
younger
lady
conversation
would
have
shocked
the
prim
maids
and
matrons
of
that
day
she
asked
dickens
if
he
had
ever
read
such
infernal
trash
as
gore
and
exclaimed
oh
god
what
a
sermon
we
had
here
last
sunday
dickens
and
his
two
daughters
who
were
decidedly
in
the
way
as
we
agreed
afterwards
dined
by
invitation
with
the
mother
and
daughter
the
daughter
asked
him
if
he
smoked
yes
said
dickens
i
generally
take
a
cigar
after
dinner
when
i
alone
thereupon
said
the
young
lady
i
give
you
a
good
when
we
go
upstairs
but
the
sequel
must
be
told
in
the
novelist
own
inimitable
style
well
sir
he
wrote
in
due
course
we
went
upstairs
and
there
we
were
joined
by
an
american
lady
residing
in
the
same
hotel
also
a
daughter
american
lady
married
at
sixteen
american
daughter
sixteen
now
often
mistaken
for
sisters
when
that
was
over
the
younger
of
our
entertainers
brought
out
a
and
gave
me
a
cigar
made
of
negrohead
she
said
which
would
quell
an
elephant
in
six
whiffs
the
box
was
full
of
cigarettes
good
large
ones
made
of
pretty
strong
tobacco
i
always
smoke
them
here
and
used
to
smoke
them
at
genoa
and
i
knew
them
well
when
i
lighted
my
cigar
daughter
lighted
hers
at
mine
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
in
conversation
with
me
put
out
her
stomach
folded
her
arms
and
with
her
pretty
face
cocked
up
sideways
and
her
cigarette
smoking
away
like
a
manchester
cotton
mill
laughed
and
talked
and
smoked
in
the
most
gentlemanly
manner
i
ever
beheld
mother
immediately
lighted
her
cigar
american
lady
immediately
lighted
hers
and
in
five
minutes
the
room
was
a
cloud
of
smoke
with
us
four
in
the
centre
pulling
away
bravely
while
american
lady
related
stories
of
her
upstairs
and
described
different
kinds
of
pipes
but
even
this
was
not
all
for
presently
two
frenchmen
came
in
with
whom
and
the
american
lady
daughter
sat
down
to
whist
the
frenchmen
smoked
of
course
they
were
really
modest
gentlemen
and
seemed
dismayed
and
daughter
played
for
the
next
hour
or
two
with
a
cigar
continually
in
her
mouth
never
out
of
it
she
certainly
smoked
six
or
eight
mother
gave
in
soon
i
think
she
only
did
it
out
of
vanity
american
lady
had
been
smoking
all
the
morning
i
took
no
more
and
daughter
and
the
frenchmen
had
it
all
to
themselves
conceive
this
in
a
great
hotel
with
not
only
their
own
servants
but
half
a
dozen
waiters
coming
constantly
in
and
out
i
showed
no
atom
of
surprise
but
i
never
so
surprised
so
ridiculously
taken
aback
in
my
life
for
in
all
my
experience
of
of
one
kind
and
another
i
never
saw
a
woman
not
a
basket
woman
or
a
gipsy
smoke
before
this
last
remark
is
highly
significant
forster
says
that
dickens
lived
to
have
larger
and
wider
experience
but
there
was
enough
to
startle
as
well
as
amuse
him
in
the
scene
described
the
words
cigar
and
cigarette
are
used
indifferently
by
the
novelist
but
it
seems
clear
from
the
description
and
from
the
number
smoked
by
the
lady
in
an
hour
or
two
that
it
was
a
cigarette
and
not
a
cigar
properly
so
called
which
was
never
out
of
her
mouth
the
ladies
who
so
surprised
dickens
were
english
and
american
but
at
the
period
in
question
the
early
of
the
last
century
one
of
the
freaks
of
fashion
at
paris
was
the
giving
of
luncheon
parties
for
ladies
only
at
which
cigars
were
handed
round
the
first
hints
of
feminine
smoking
in
england
may
be
traced
like
so
many
other
changes
in
fashion
in
the
pages
of
in
folk
were
alarmed
and
shocked
at
a
sudden
and
outburst
of
bloomerism
imported
from
the
united
states
of
course
it
was
at
once
suggested
that
women
who
would
go
so
far
as
to
imitate
masculine
attire
and
to
emancipate
themselves
from
the
usual
conventions
of
feminine
dress
would
naturally
seek
to
imitate
men
in
other
ways
also
leech
had
a
picture
of
a
quiet
smoke
in
which
depicted
five
ladies
in
short
wide
skirts
and
bloomers
in
a
tobacconist
shop
two
smoking
cigars
and
one
a
pipe
while
one
of
the
inferior
animals
behind
the
counter
was
selling
tobacco
but
this
was
satire
and
hardly
had
much
relation
to
fact
it
was
not
until
the
of
the
last
century
that
by
women
began
to
creep
in
mortimer
collins
writing
in
in
a
curious
outburst
against
the
use
of
tobacco
by
young
men
said
when
one
hears
of
sly
cigarettes
between
feminine
lips
at
croquet
parties
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
since
that
date
has
become
increasingly
popular
among
women
and
the
term
sly
has
long
ceased
to
be
applicable
punch
for
had
an
amusing
skit
on
a
ladies
to
which
punch
acted
as
coach
after
breakfast
the
reading
ladies
lounged
on
the
lawn
with
cigarettes
what
queen
victoria
who
hated
tobacco
and
banished
it
from
her
presence
and
from
her
abodes
as
far
as
she
could
would
have
thought
and
said
of
the
extent
to
which
is
indulged
in
now
by
women
is
a
question
quite
unanswerable
yet
queen
victoria
once
received
a
present
of
pipes
and
tobacco
by
the
hands
of
sir
richard
burton
the
queen
had
sent
a
damask
tent
a
silver
pipe
and
two
silver
trays
to
the
king
of
dahomey
that
potentate
told
sir
richard
that
the
tent
was
very
handsome
but
too
small
that
the
silver
pipe
did
not
smoke
so
well
as
his
old
red
clay
with
a
wooden
stem
and
that
though
he
liked
the
trays
very
much
he
thought
them
hardly
large
enough
to
serve
as
shields
he
hoped
that
the
next
gifts
would
include
a
carriage
and
pair
and
a
white
woman
both
of
which
he
would
appreciate
very
much
however
he
sent
gifts
in
return
to
her
britannic
majesty
and
among
them
were
a
west
african
state
umbrella
a
selection
of
highly
coloured
clothing
materials
and
some
native
pipes
and
tobacco
for
the
queen
to
smoke
many
royal
ladies
of
europe
contemporaries
of
queen
victoria
and
her
son
have
had
the
reputation
of
being
confirmed
smokers
among
them
may
be
named
carmen
sylva
the
poetess
queen
of
roumania
the
dowager
tsaritsa
of
russia
the
late
empress
of
austria
king
mother
formerly
of
spain
the
dowager
queen
margherita
of
italy
and
amélie
of
portugal
it
is
of
course
well
known
that
austrian
and
russian
ladies
generally
are
fond
of
on
russian
railways
it
is
not
unusual
to
find
a
compartment
labelled
for
ladies
who
do
not
smoke
the
newspapers
reported
not
long
ago
from
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
that
the
smart
women
of
chicago
had
substituted
cigars
for
cigarettes
according
to
an
interview
with
a
chicago
hotel
proprietor
the
fair
smokers
select
their
cigars
as
men
do
either
black
and
strong
or
light
according
to
taste
how
in
the
world
else
could
they
select
them
it
is
not
likely
however
that
will
become
popular
among
women
for
one
thing
it
leaves
too
strong
and
too
clinging
an
odour
on
the
clothes
one
of
the
latest
announcements
however
in
the
fashion
pages
of
the
newspapers
is
the
advent
of
smoking
jackets
for
ladies
we
are
informed
in
the
usual
style
of
such
pages
that
the
woman
has
begun
to
consider
the
little
indispensable
this
jacket
we
are
told
is
a
very
different
matter
to
the
braided
velvet
coats
which
were
donned
by
our
masculine
forbears
in
the
days
of
long
drooping
cavalry
moustaches
tightly
buttoned
and
flexible
canes
the
feminine
of
is
worn
with
entrancing
little
evening
or
frocks
and
represents
a
compromise
between
a
cloak
and
a
coat
being
exquisitely
draped
and
fashioned
of
the
softest
and
most
attractive
of
the
season
beautiful
fabrics
there
are
still
many
good
people
nowadays
who
are
shocked
at
the
idea
of
women
smoking
and
to
them
may
be
commended
the
words
of
bishop
formerly
of
ripon
who
arrived
in
new
york
early
in
to
deliver
a
series
of
lectures
at
harvard
university
the
american
newspapers
reported
him
as
saying
with
reference
to
this
subject
many
women
in
england
who
are
well
thought
of
smoke
i
do
not
attempt
to
enter
into
the
ethical
part
of
this
matter
but
this
much
i
say
if
men
find
it
such
a
pleasure
to
smoke
why
women
there
are
many
colours
in
the
rainbow
so
there
are
many
tastes
in
people
what
may
be
a
pleasure
to
men
may
be
given
to
women
when
we
find
women
smoking
as
they
do
in
some
branches
of
society
the
mere
pleasure
of
that
habit
must
be
accepted
as
belonging
to
both
sexes
xiv
smoking
in

for
thy
sake
tobacco
i
would
do
anything
but
die
charles
lamb
farewell
to
the
use
of
tobacco
in
churches
forms
a
curious
if
short
chapter
in
the
social
history
of
smoking
the
earliest
reference
to
such
a
practice
occurs
in
when
pope
innocent
xii
excommunicated
all
such
persons
as
were
found
taking
snuff
or
using
tobacco
in
any
form
in
the
church
of
peter
at
rome
and
again
in
pope
urban
viii
issued
a
bull
against
the
use
of
tobacco
in
churches
in
england
it
would
seem
as
if
some
of
the
early
smokers
in
the
fulness
of
their
enthusiasm
for
the
new
indulgence
went
so
far
as
to
smoke
in
church
when
king
james
i
was
about
to
visit
cambridge
the
of
the
university
put
forth
sundry
regulations
in
connexion
with
the
royal
visit
in
which
may
be
found
the
following
passage
that
noe
graduate
scholler
or
student
of
this
universitie
presume
to
resort
to
any
inn
taverne
alehowse
or
at
any
tyme
dureing
the
aboade
of
his
majestie
here
nor
doe
presume
to
take
tobacco
in
marie
church
or
in
trinity
colledge
hall
uppon
payne
of
finall
expellinge
the
universitie
evidently
the
intention
was
to
make
things
pleasant
for
the
royal
foe
of
tobacco
during
his
visit
it
would
appear
to
be
a
fair
inference
from
the
wording
of
this
prohibition
that
when
the
king
was
not
at
cambridge
graduates
and
scholars
and
students
could
resume
their
liberty
to
resort
to
inns
taverns
and
and
presumably
to
take
tobacco
in
mary
church
without
question
the
prohibition
in
the
regulation
quoted
of
smoking
in
church
referred
it
may
be
noted
to
the
act
which
was
held
therein
candidates
for
degrees
or
graduates
to
display
their
proficiency
publicly
maintained
theses
and
this
performance
was
termed
keeping
or
holding
an
act
it
is
of
course
conceivable
that
the
prohibition
so
far
as
the
church
and
trinity
college
hall
were
concerned
was
against
the
taking
of
snuff
rather
than
against
smoking
but
the
phrase
to
take
tobacco
was
at
that
time
quite
commonly
applied
to
smoking
and
considering
the
extraordinary
and
immoderate
use
of
tobacco
soon
after
its
introduction
it
is
not
in
the
least
incredible
that
pipes
were
lighted
at
least
occasionally
even
in
sacred
buildings
sometimes
tobacco
was
used
in
church
for
disinfecting
or
deodorizing
purposes
the
churchwardens
accounts
of
peter
barnstaple
for
contain
the
entry
pd
for
tobacco
and
frankincense
burnt
in
the
church
sprigs
of
juniper
pitch
and
sweete
wood
in
combination
with
incense
were
often
used
for
the
same
purpose
smoking
it
may
safely
be
asserted
was
never
practised
commonly
in
english
churches
even
in
our
own
day
people
have
been
observed
smoking
not
during
service
time
but
in
passing
through
the
building
in
church
in
some
of
the
south
american
states
and
nearer
home
in
holland
but
in
england
such
desecration
has
been
occasional
only
and
quite
exceptional
one
need
not
be
much
surprised
at
any
instance
of
lack
of
reverence
in
english
churches
during
the
eighteenth
century
and
a
few
instances
can
be
given
of
church
smoking
in
that
era
blackburn
archbishop
of
york
was
a
great
smoker
on
one
occasion
he
was
at
mary
church
nottingham
for
a
confirmation
the
story
of
what
happened
was
told
long
afterwards
in
a
letter
written
in
december
by
john
disney
rector
of
swinderby
lincolnshire
the
grandson
of
the
disney
who
at
the
time
of
the
archbishop
visit
to
mary
was
incumbent
of
that
church
this
letter
was
addressed
to
james
granger
and
was
published
in
granger
correspondence
the
anecdote
which
you
mention
wrote
the
disney
of
swinderby
is
i
believe
unquestionably
true
the
affair
happened
in
mary
church
at
nottingham
when
archbishop
blackbourn
of
york
was
there
on
a
visitation
the
archbishop
had
ordered
some
of
the
apparitors
or
other
attendants
to
bring
him
pipes
and
tobacco
and
some
liquor
into
the
vestry
for
his
refreshment
after
the
fatigue
of
confirmation
and
this
coming
to
disney
ears
he
forbad
them
being
brought
thither
and
with
a
becoming
spirit
remonstrated
with
the
archbishop
upon
the
impropriety
of
his
conduct
at
the
same
time
telling
his
grace
that
his
vestry
should
not
be
converted
into
a
another
clerical
worthy
the
famous
parr
an
inveterate
smoker
was
accustomed
to
do
what
disney
prevented
archbishop
blackburn
from
doing
he
smoked
in
his
vestry
at
hatton
this
he
did
before
the
sermon
while
the
congregation
were
singing
a
hymn
and
apparently
both
parties
were
pleased
for
parr
would
say
my
people
like
long
hymns
but
i
prefer
a
long
clay
robert
hall
the
famous
baptist
preacher
having
once
upon
a
time
strongly
denounced
smoking
as
an
odious
custom
learned
to
smoke
himself
as
a
result
of
his
acquaintance
with
parr
parr
was
such
a
continual
smoker
that
anyone
who
came
into
his
company
if
he
had
never
smoked
before
had
to
learn
the
use
of
a
pipe
as
a
means
of
hall
who
became
a
heavy
smoker
is
said
to
have
smoked
in
his
vestry
at
intervals
in
the
service
he
probably
found
some
relief
in
tobacco
from
the
severe
internal
pains
with
which
for
many
years
he
was
afflicted
ditchfield
in
his
entertaining
book
on
the
parish
clerk
tells
a
story
of
a
lincolnshire
curate
who
was
a
great
smoker
and
who
like
parr
was
accustomed
to
retire
to
the
vestry
before
the
sermon
and
there
smoke
a
pipe
while
the
congregation
sang
a
psalm
one
sunday
says
ditchfield
he
had
an
extra
pipe
and
joshua
the
clerk
told
him
that
the
people
were
getting
impatient
them
sing
another
psalm
said
the
curate
have
sir
replied
the
clerk
let
them
sing
the
hundred
and
nineteenth
replied
the
curate
at
last
he
finished
his
pipe
and
began
to
put
on
the
black
gown
but
its
folds
were
troublesome
and
he
could
not
get
it
on
think
the
devil
in
the
gown
muttered
the
curate
think
he
be
dryly
replied
old
joshua
the
same
writer
in
his
companion
volume
on
the
old
time
parson
mentions
that
the
vicar
of
codrington
in
found
that
it
was
actually
customary
for
people
to
play
cards
on
the
communion
table
and
that
when
they
chose
the
churchwardens
they
used
to
sit
in
the
sanctuary
smoking
and
drinking
the
clerk
gravely
saying
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
that
such
had
been
their
custom
for
the
last
sixty
years
although
probably
the
conduct
of
the
codrington
parishioners
was
unusual
it
is
certain
that
in
the
seventeenth
century
smoking
at
meetings
held
not
in
the
church
itself
but
in
the
vestry
was
common
the
churchwardens
accounts
of
mary
leicester
record
the
expenditure
in
beer
and
tobacco
from
first
to
last
in
those
of
alphege
london
wall
for
there
are
the
entries
for
pipes
and
tobaccoe
in
the
vestry
and
for
a
grosse
of
pipes
at
severall
times
in
the
next
century
however
the
practice
was
modified
the
alphege
accounts
for
have
the
entry
ordered
that
there
be
no
smoaking
nor
drinking
for
the
future
in
the
vestry
room
during
the
time
business
is
doing
on
pain
of
forfeiting
one
shilling
assention
day
excepted
from
this
it
would
seem
fair
to
infer
that
there
was
no
objection
to
the

on

day
for
some
inscrutable
reason
there
was
no
prohibition
at
all
of
smoaking
and
drinking
readers
of
sir
walter
scott
will
remember
in
the
heart
of
midlothian
one
curious
instance
of
smoking
in
church
in
a
scottish
presbyterian
church
too
jeanie
deans
beloved
reuben
butler
was
about
to
be
ordained
to
the
charge
of
the
parish
of
knocktarlitie
dumbartonshire
the
congregation
were
duly
seated
after
prayers
douce
david
deans
occupying
a
seat
among
the
elders
and
the
officiating
minister
had
read
his
text
preparatory
to
the
delivery
of
his
hour
and
a
quarter
sermon
the
redoubtable
duncan
of
knockdunder
was
making
his
preparations
also
for
the
sermon
after
rummaging
the
leathern
purse
which
hung
in
front
of
his
petticoat
he
produced
a
short
made
of
iron
and
observed
almost
aloud
hae
forgotten
my
spleuchan
lachlan
gang
doon
to
the
clachan
and
bring
me
up
a
pennyworth
of
twist
six
arms
the
nearest
within
reach
presented
with
an
obedient
start
as
many
to
the
man
of
office
he
made
choice
of
one
with
a
nod
of
acknowledgment
filled
his
pipe
lighted
it
with
the
assistance
of
his
and
smoked
with
infinite
composure
during
the
whole
time
of
the
sermon
when
the
discourse
was
finished
he
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
replaced
it
in
his
sporran
returned
the
or
spleuchan
to
its
owner
and
joined
in
the
prayers
with
decency
and
attention
david
deans
however
did
not
at
all
approve
this
irreverence
it
didna
become
a
wild
indian
he
said
much
less
a
christian
and
a
gentleman
to
sit
in
the
kirk
puffing
as
if
he
were
in
a
the
date
of
the
incident
was
but
whether
sir
walter
had
any
authority
in
fact
for
this
characteristic
performance
of
knockdunder
or
not
it
is
certain
that
any
such
occurrence
in
a
scottish
kirk
must
have
been
extremely
rare
knockdunder
pipe
according
to
scott
was
made
of
iron
this
was
an
infrequent
material
for
but
there
are
a
few
examples
in
museums
in
the
belfast
museum
there
is
a
cast
iron
about
eighteen
inches
long
with
it
are
shown
another
very
short
also
of
cast
iron
the
bowl
of
a
brass
pipe
and
a
pipe
about
six
inches
in
length
made
of
sheet
iron
another
instance
of
smoking
in
church
taken
from
historical
fact
and
not
from
fiction
is
associated
with
the
church
of
hayes
in
middlesex
the
parish
registers
of
that
village
bear
witness
to
repeated
disputes
between
the
parson
and
and
the
parishioners
generally
in
in
it
was
noted
that
a
sermon
had
been
preached
after
a
funeral
to
a
noisy
congregation
on
another
occasion
says
the
register
the
ringers
and
other
inhabitants
disturbed
the
service
from
the
beginning
of
prayers
to
the
end
of
the
sermon
by
ringing
the
bells
and
going
into
the
gallery
to
spit
below
while
at
yet
another
time
a
fellow
came
into
church
with
a
pot
of
beer
and
a
pipe
and
remained
smoking
in
his
own
pew
until
the
end
of
the
sermon
going
to
church
at
hayes
in
those
days
must
have
been
quite
an
exciting
experience
no
one
knew
what
might
happen
next
in
remote
english
and
welsh
parishes
men
seem
occasionally
to
have
smoked
in
churches
without
any
intention
of
being
irreverent
and
without
any
consciousness
that
they
were
doing
anything
unusual
canon
atkinson
in
his
delightful
book
forty
years
in
a
moorland
parish
tells
how
when
he
first
went
to
danby
in
cleveland
then
very
remote
from
the
great
world
and
had
to
take
his
first
funeral
he
found
inside
the
church
the
parish
clerk
who
was
also
parish
schoolmaster
by
the
way
sitting
in
the
sunny
embrasure
of
the
west
window
with
his
hat
on
and
comfortably
smoking
his
pipe
a
correspondent
of
the
in
mentioned
that
his
mother
had
told
him
how
she
remembered
seeing
smoking
in
a
welsh
church
about
the
communion
table
stood
in
the
aisle
and
the
farmers
were
in
the
habit
of
putting
their
hats
upon
it
and
when
the
sermon
began
they
lit
their
pipes
and
smoked
but
without
any
idea
of
irreverence
in
an
essex
church
about
a
visitor
had
pointed
out
to
him
various
nooks
in
the
gallery
where
short
pipes
were
stowed
away
which
he
was
informed
the
old
men
smoked
during
service
and
several
of
the
pews
in
the
body
of
the
church
contained
triangular
wooden
spittoons
filled
with
sawdust
a
clergyman
has
put
it
on
record
that
when
he
went
in
as
to
an
norfolk
village
at
his
first
early
celebration
he
arrived
in
church
about
and
he
says
to
my
amazement
saw
five
old
men
sitting
round
the
stove
in
the
nave
with
their
hats
on
smoking
their
pipes
i
expostulated
with
them
quite
quietly
but
they
left
the
church
before
service
and
never
came
again
i
discovered
afterwards
that
they
had
been
regular
communicants
and
that
my
predecessor
always
distributed
the
offertory
to
the
poor
present
immediately
after
the
service
when
these
men
in
the
course
of
my
remonstrance
found
that
i
was
not
going
to
continue
the
custom
they
no
longer
cared
to
be
communicants
nowadays
if
smoking
takes
place
in
church
at
all
it
can
only
be
done
with
intentional
irreverence
and
it
is
painful
to
think
that
even
at
the
present
day
there
are
people
in
whom
a
feeling
of
reverence
and
decency
is
so
far
lacking
as
to
lead
them
to
desecrate
places
of
worship
the
vicar
of
lancaster
at
his
easter
vestry
meeting
in
complained
of
visitors
to
the
parish
church
who
ate
their
lunch
smoked
and
wore
their
hats
while
looking
round
the
building
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
that
these
people
were
unconscious
of
the
impropriety
of
their
conduct
xv
tobacconists
signs
i
would
enjoin
every
shop
to
make
use
of
a
sign
which
bears
some
affinity
to
the
wares
in
which
it
deals
addison
april
were
one
of
the
most
conspicuous
features
of
the
streets
of
old
london
in
days
when
the
numbering
of
houses
was
unknown
the
use
of
signs
was
indispensable
for
identification
and
greatly
must
they
have
contributed
to
the
quaint
and
picturesque
appearance
of
the
streets
some
projected
far
over
the
narrow
roadway
competition
to
attract
attention
and
custom
is
no
modern
novelty
some
were
fastened
to
posts
or
pillars
in
front
of
the
houses
by
the
time
of
charles
ii
the
overhanging
signs
had
become
a
nuisance
and
a
danger
and
in
the
seventh
year
of
that
king
reign
an
act
was
passed
providing
that
no
sign
should
hang
across
the
street
but
that
all
should
be
fixed
to
the
balconies
or
fronts
or
sides
of
houses
this
act
was
not
strictly
obeyed
and
large
numbers
of
signs
were
hung
over
the
doors
while
many
others
were
affixed
to
the
fronts
of
the
houses
eventually
in
the
second
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
signs
gradually
disappeared
and
the
streets
were
numbered
there
were
occasional
survivals
which
are
to
be
found
to
this
day
such
as
the
barber
pole
accompanied
sometimes
by
the
brass
basin
of
the
the
glorified
canister
of
a
grocer
or
the
golden
leg
of
a
hosier
and
inn
signs
have
never
failed
us
but
by
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
most
of
the
old
trade
signs
which
flaunted
themselves
in
the
streets
had
disappeared
the
sellers
of
tobacco
naturally
hung
out
their
signs
like
other
tradesfolk
signs
in
their
early
days
were
no
doubt
chosen
to
intimate
the
trades
of
those
who
used
them
and
in
the
days
when
it
was
considered
the
right
and
natural
thing
for
a
son
to
be
brought
up
to
his
father
trade
and
to
succeed
him
therein
they
long
remained
appropriate
and
intelligible
later
as
we
shall
see
they
became
meaningless
in
many
cases
but
in
the
days
when
first
came
into
vogue
the
signs
chosen
naturally
had
some
reference
to
the
trade
they
indicated
and
one
of
the
earliest
used
was
the
sign
of
the
black
boy
in
allusion
to
the
association
of
the
negro
with
tobacco
cultivation
the
black
boy
existed
as
a
before
tobacco
triumph
for
henry
machyn
in
his
diary
so
early
as
december
mentions
a
goldsmith
dwellying
at
the
sene
of
the
blake
boy
in
the
cheep
but
the
early
sellers
of
tobacco
soon
fastened
on
this
appropriate
sign
the
earliest
reference
to
such
use
may
be
found
in
ben
jonson
bartholomew
fair
where
in
the
first
scene
humphrey
waspe
says
i
thought
he
would
have
run
mad
o
the
black
boy
in
bucklersbury
that
takes
the
scurvy
roguy
tobacco
there
later
the
black
boy
like
other
once
significant
signs
became
meaningless
and
was
used
in
connexion
with
various
trades
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
a
bookseller
at
the
sign
of
the
black
boy
on
london
bridge
was
advertising
defoe
robinson
crusoe
another
bookseller
traded
at
the
black
boy
in
paternoster
row
in
linendrapers
hatters
pawnbrokers
and
other
tradesmen
all
used
the
same
sign
at
various
dates
in
the
eighteenth
century
but
side
by
side
with
this
indiscriminate
and
unnecessary
use
of
the
sign
there
existed
a
continuous
association
of
the
black
boy
with
the
tobacco
trade
a
tobacconist
named
milward
lived
at
the
black
boy
in
redcross
street
barbican
in
and
many
old
tobacco
papers
show
a
black
boy
or
sometimes
two
smoking
holden
macmichael
in
his
papers
on
the
london
signs
says
skinner
of
the
tobacconist
opposite
the
law
courts
in
the
strand
possessed
about
the
year
two
signs
of
the
boy
appertaining
no
doubt
to
the
old
house
of
skinner
on
holborn
hill
of
the
front
of
which
there
is
an
illustration
in
the
archer
collection
in
the
print
department
of
the
british
museum
where
the
black
boy
and
are
depicted
outside
the
premises
the
black
boy
indeed
continued
in
use
by
tobacconists
until
the
nineteenth
century
was
well
advanced
a
tobacconist
had
a
shop
uppon
wapping
wall
in
at
the
sign
of
the
black
boy
and
pelican
other
significant
early
tobacconists
signs
were
sir
walter
raleigh
the
virginian
and
the
tobacco
roll
sir
walter
as
the
reputed
introducer
of
tobacco
was
naturally
chosen
as
a
sign
and
his
portrait
adorns
several
in
the
banks
collection
the
american
indians
represented
under
the
figure
of
the
virginian
and
the
negroes
were
hopelessly
confused
by
the
early
tobacconists
with
results
which
were
sometimes
surprising
from
an
ethnological
point
of
view
as
the
first
tobacco
imported
into
this
country
came
from
virginia
a
supposed
virginian
was
naturally
adopted
as
a
sign
at
an
early
date
an
indian
or
a
negro
or
a
figure
which
was
a
combination
of
both
was
commonly
represented
wearing
a
kilt
or
a
girdle
of
tobacco
leaves
a
feathered
and
smoking
a
pipe
a
dating
from
about
the
time
of

tobacconist

sixty
years
or
so
ago
a
wooden
figure
representing
a
negro
with
a
gilt
and
band
with
feathered
head
and
sometimes
with
a
tobacco
roll
was
still
a
frequent
ornament
of
tobacconists
shops
the
tobacco
roll
either
alone
or
in
various
combinations
was
one
of
the
commonest
of
early
tobacconists
signs
and
was
in
constant
use
for
a
couple
of
centuries
it
may
still
be
occasionally
seen
at
the
present
time
in
the
form
of
the
twist
with
alternate
brown
or
black
and
yellow
coils
which
up
to
quite
a
recent
date
was
a
tolerably
frequent
adornment
of
tobacconists
shops
but
is
now
rare
this
roll
represented
what
was
called
spun
or
twist
tobacco
dekker
in
james
i
time
speaks
of
roll
tobacco
the
youngster
who
mimics
the
in
jonson
cynthia
revels
as
described
in
chapter
ii
page
says
that
he
has
three
sorts
of
tobacco
in
his
pocket
which
probably
means
that
it
was
customary
to
mix
for
smoking
purposes
tobacco
of
the
three
usual
kinds
roll
or
pudding
leaf
and
cane
one
would
have
thought
that
a
representation
of
the
tobacco
plant
itself
would
have
been
a
more
natural
and
comprehensive
sign
than
one
particular
preparation
of
the
herb
yet
representations
of
the
plant
were
rare
while
those
of
the
compressed
tobacco
known
as
pudding
or
roll
in
the
form
of
a
tobacco
roll
as
described
above
were
very
frequently
used
as
signs
from
the
examples
given
in
burn
descriptive
catalogue
of
london
tokens
of
the
seventeenth
century
it
is
clear
that
the
tobacco
roll
was
a
warm
favourite
three
tobacco
rolls
was
also
used
as
a
sign
in
there
was
a
tobacco
roll

tradesmen
a

of

it
may
be
noted
was
a
common
form
of
payment
to
the
fleet
parsons
for
their
scoundrelly
services
pennant
writing

how
these

hung

of
a
male
and
female
hand
conjoined
with
the
legend
written
below

performed

walked
the

a
squalid
profligate
figure
clad
in
a

plaid

with
a
fiery
face
and
ready
to
couple
you
for
a
dram
of
gin
or
roll
of
tobacco
combinations
of
the
roll
in
tobacconists
signs
occur
occasionally
in
there
was
a
tobacco
roll
and
sugar
loaf
at
gray
inn
gate
holborn
in
james
barnes
issued
a
farthing
token
from
the
sugar
loaf
and
three
tobacco
rolls
in
the
poultry
london
the
sugar
loaf
was
the
principal
grocer
sign
and
so
when
it
is
found
in
combination
with
the
tobacco
roll
at
this
time
it
may
reasonably
be
assumed
that
the
proprietor
of
the
business
was
a
grocer
who
was
also
a
tobacconist
before
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
however
the
signs
were
ceasing
to
have
any
necessary
association
with
the
trade
carried
on
under
them
and
tobacconists
are
found
with
which
had
no
reference
in
any
way
to
tobacco
for
instance
to
take
a
few
examples
from
the
late
hilton
price
lists
of
signs
of
old
london
from
cheapside
and
adjacent
streets

note
of
the

of
the

that

the

of

so
forth
and
next
the
absurd
custom
by
which
young

at

added
their
own

to
those
of
the
masters
under
whom
they

the

goes
on

say
in

i
would
enjoin

to
make
use
of
a

bears
some

deals
what
can

to

the
few
examples

tobacconists
more
than
most
tradesmen
seem
to
have
continued
to

signs
that
had
at
least
some
relevance
to
their
trade
abel
drugger
was
a
a
in
ben
jonson
play
of
the
alchemist
so
that
it
is
not
very
surprising
to
find
the
name
used
occasionally
as
a
tobacconist
sign
towards
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
one
peter
cockburn
traded
as
a
tobacconist
at
the
sign
of
the
abel
drugger
in
fenchurch
street
and
informed
the
public
on
the
advertising
papers
in
which
he
wrapped
up
his
tobacco
for
customers
that
he
had
formerly
been
shopman
at
the

notice
which
has
preserved

name
of
another

literature

were
the

pipes
two
tobacco
pipes

five
tobacco
pipes
at
edinburgh
in

there
were
tobacconists

two

the
older

larwood
that
the

says
that
a

a
frequent
among
dealers
in
snuff
was
the
crown
and
rasp
the
oldest
method
of
taking
snuff
says
larwood
in
the
history
of
signboards
was
to
scrape
it
with
a
rasp
from
the
dry
root
of
the
tobacco
plant
the
powder
was
then
placed
on
the
back
of
the
hand
and
so
snuffed
up
hence
the
name
of
rasped
for
a
kind
of
snuff
and
the
common
tobacconist
sign
of
la
carotte
the
golden
root
in
france
became
in
english
rappee
familiar
in
days
as
the
name
for
a
coarse

and
ranker

the
rasps
for

continues
larwood
were
carried
in
the
waistcoat
pocket
and
soon
became
articles
of
luxury
being
carved
in
ivory
and
variously
enriched
some
of
them
in
ivory
and
inlaid
wood
may
be
seen
at
the
hotel
cluny
in
paris
and
an
engraving
of
such
an
object
occurs
in
vol
xiii
one
of
the
first
was
the
or
box
at
the
back
of
which
was
a
little
space
for
a
piece
of
the
root
whilst
a
small
iron
rasp
was
contained
in
the
middle
when
a
pinch
was
wanted
the
root
was
drawn
a
few
times
over
the
iron
rasp
and
so
the
snuff
was
produced
and
could
be
offered
to
a
friend
with
much
more
grace
than
under
the
process
with
the
the
tobacconists
sign
that
for
very
many
years
was
in
most
general
use
was
the
figure
of
a
highlander
which
may
still
perhaps
be
found
in
one
or
two
places
but
which
was
not
at
all
an
unusual
sight
in
the
streets
of
london
and
other
towns
some
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
most
men
of
middle
age
can
remember
when
the
highlander
was
the
usual
ornament
to
the
entrance
of
a
tobacconist
shop
but
all
have
disappeared
from
london
streets
save
two
i
say
two
on
the
authority
of
lucas
who
gives
it
in
his
wanderer
in
london
as
the
number
of
the
survivors
but
only
one
is
known
to
me
this
is
the
famous
old
wooden
highlander
which
stood
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
on
guard
at
a
tobacconist
shop
in
tottenham
court
road
about
the
end
of
it
was
announced
that
the
shop
was
to
be
demolished
and
that
the
figure
was
for
sale
the
announcement
created
no
small
stir
and
it
was
said
that
the
offers
for
the
highlander
ran
up
to
a
surprising
figure
he
was
bought
ultimately
by
a
neighbouring
furnishing
firm
and
now
stands
on
duty
not
far
from
his
ancient
post
though
no
can
help
feeling
the
incongruity
between
the
emblem
of
the
and
his
present
surroundings
of
linoleum
and
sich
where
lucas
second
survivor
may
be
is
unknown
to
me
not
so
many
years
ago
a
wooden
highlander
as
a
tobacconist
sign
was
a
conspicuous
figure
in
knightsbridge
and
there
was
another
in
the
westminster
bridge
road
but
edax
has
consumed
them
with
all
their
brethren
in
a
few
provincial
towns
a
wooden
highlander
may
still
be
found
at
the
door
of
tobacco
shops
but
they
are
probably
destined
to
early
disappearance
in
one
still
stood
guard
a
tall
figure
in
full
costume
outside
a
tobacconist
shop
in
cheltenham
and
may
still
be
there
there
is
a
highlander
of
oak
in
the
costume
of
the
black
watch
still
standing
i
believe
in
the
doorway
of
a
tobacco
shop
at
heliers
jersey
it
is
traditionally
said
to
have
been
originally
the
of
a
war
vessel
which
was
wrecked
on
the
alderney
coast
another
survivor
may
be
seen
at
the
door
of
a
shop
belonging
to
churchman
tobacco
manufacturers
in
westgate
street
ipswich
a
correspondent
of
notes
and
queries
describes
it
as
a
very
fine
specimen
in
excellent
condition
and
adds
churchman
informs
me
that
it
belonged
to
his
grandfather
who
established
the
business
in
ipswich
in
and
he
believed
it
was
quite
hundred
year
old
at
that
time
one
of
the
earliest
known
examples
of
these
highlanders
as
tobacconists
signs
is
that
which
was
placed
at
the
door
of
a
shop
in
coventry
street
which
was
opened
in
under
the
sign
of
the
highlander
thistle
and
crown
this
is
said
to
have
been
a
favourite
place
of
resort
of
the
jacobites
in
his
nicotine
and
its
rariora
mr
broadley
gives
the
card
dated
of
william
kebb
at
ye
highlander
ye
corner
of
pall
mall
facing
james
haymarket
and
says
that
the
highlander
was
a
favourite
tobacconist
sign
for
years
i
have
been
unable
however
to
find
evidence
of
such
a
prolonged
period
of
favour
i
know
of
no
certain
reference
to
the
highlander
as
a
tobacconist
sign
the
figure
was
usually
made
with
a
snuff
mull
in
his
hand
the
highlander
being
always
credited
with
a
great
love
and
a
great
capacity
for
but
one
curious
example
was
furnished
not
only
with
a
mull
but
with
a
implement
of
unknown
use
arthur
denman
writing
in
and
april
said
i
have
a
very
neat
little
genuine
specimen
of
the
old
tobacconist
sign
of
a
highlander
with
his
it
is
in
high
and
it
differs
from
those
usually
met
with
in
that
under
the
left
arm
is
an
implement
almost
exactly
like
a
this
bat
has
a
gilt
knob
to
the
handle
and
on
the
shoulder
of
it
are
three
chevrons
in
gold
without
doubt
a
sergeant
stripes
on
the
exposed
side
of
the
bat
is
what
would
appear
to
represent
a
loose
strip
of
wood
this
strip
is
nearly
of
the
width
of
the
instrument
and
extends
up
the
middle
about
of
the
length
of
the
body
of
it
i
can
only
guess
that
the
bat
was
at
some
time
primarily
an
emblem
of
a
sergeant
office
and
secondarily
used
for
the
infliction
of
chastisement
on
clumsy
or
disorderly
recruits
and
perhaps
it
was
equivalent
to
the
of
german
armies
with
which
sergeants
drove
lagging
warriors
into
the
fray
but
is
there
any
record
of
such
an
accoutrement
as
being
that
of
a
sergeant
in
the
british
army
and
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
loose
strip
unless
it
was
to
cause
the
blow
administered
to
resound
as
much
as
to
hurt
as
does
the
wand
of
harlequin
in
a
booth
these
questions
received
no
answers
from
the
learned
correspondents
of
the
most
useful
and
omniscient
of
weekly
papers
personally
i
much
doubt
denman
suggested
explanations
of
his
highlander
curious
implement
there
is
no
evidence
that
a
sergeant
in
the
british
army
ever
carried
a
implement
either
as
a
sign
of
office
or
to
be
used
for
disciplinary
or
punitive
purposes
like
the
canes
of
the
german
sergeants
of
long
ago
it
would
seem
to
be
more
likely
that
this
particular
figure
was
of
unusual
perhaps
unique
make
and
had
some
special
local
or
individual
significance
wherever
or
for
whom
it
was
first
made
and
used
which
has
now
been
forgotten
after
the
suppression
of
the
jacobite
uprising
of
the
english
government
made
war
on
scottish
nationality
and
among
other
measures
the
wearing
of
the
highland
dress
was
forbidden
by
parliament
on
this
occasion
the
following
paragraph
appeared
in
the
newspapers
of
the
time
we
hear
that
the
dapper
wooden
highlanders
who
guard
so
heroically
the
doors
of
intend
to
petition
the
legislature
in
order
that
they
may
be
excused
from
complying
with
the
act
of
parliament
with
regard
to
their
change
of
dress
alledging
that
they
have
ever
been
faithful
subjects
to
his
majesty
having
constantly
supplied
his
guards
with
a
pinch
out
of
their
mulls
when
they
marched
by
them
and
so
far
from
engaging
in
any
rebellion
that
they
have
never
entertained
a
rebellious
thought
whence
they
humbly
hope
that
they
shall
not
be
put
to
the
expense
of
buying
new
cloaths
this
is
not
a
very
humorous
production
but
at
least
it
bears
witness
to
the
common
occurrence
in
of
the
highlander
figure
at
the
shops
of
snuff
and
the
highlander
as
he
existed
within
living
memory
at
many
shop
doors
and
as
he
still
exists
at
a
few
was
and
is
the
survivor
of
many
similar
wooden
figures
as
trade
signs
the
wooden
figure
of
a
negro
or
indian
with
gilt
and
feathered
head
has
already
been
mentioned
as
an
old
tobacconist
sign
in
early
georgian
days
a
tobacconist
named
john
bowden
who
dealt
in
all
kinds
of
snuff
and
also
in
aloe
pigtail
and
wild
tobacco
with
all
sorts
of
perfumer
goods
wholesale
and
retail
traded
at
the
sign
of
the
highlander
and
black
boy
in
threadneedle
street
london
at
york
in
this
present
year
i
came
upon
a
brightly
painted
wooden
figure
of
napoleon
in
full
uniform
and
in
hand
standing
at
the
door
of
a
small
another
class
of
sign
or
emblem
was
represented
by
the
wooden
midshipman
which
many
of
us
have
seen
in
leadenhall
street
and
which
dickens
made
famous
in
dombey
and
son
sometimes
the
wooden
figure
of
a
sailor
stood
outside
with
such
signs
as
the
jolly
sailor
and
a
black
doll
was
long
a
familiar
token
of
the
loathly
shop
kept
by
the
tradesmen
mysteriously
known
as
marine
store
dealers
images
of
this
kind
sometimes
stood
at
the
door
or
in
many
cases
were
placed
on
brackets
or
swung
from
the
lintels
sir
walter
scott
said
that
in
london
a
scotchman
would
walk
half
a
mile
farther
to
purchase
his
ounce
of
snuff
where
the
sign
of
the
highlander
announced
a
north
briton
dickens
little
figure
which
adorned
old
sol
gills
shop
thrust
itself
out
above
the
pavement
right
leg
foremost
with
shoe
buckles
and
flapped
waistcoat
very
much
unlike
the
real
thing
and
bore
at
its
right
eye
the
most
offensively
disproportionate
piece
of
machinery
but
this
was
only
one
of
many
little
timber
midshipmen
in
obsolete
naval
uniforms
eternally
employed
outside
the
of
nautical
in
taking
observations
of
the
all
have
disappeared

with
the
black
dolls
of
the
rag
shops
and
many
other
figures
a
stray
highlander
or
two
or
other
figure
may
survive
here
and
there
but
with
very
few
exceptions
indeed
the
once
abundant
tobacconists
signs
have
disappeared
from
our
