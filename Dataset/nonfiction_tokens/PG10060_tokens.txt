preface
the
contents
of
the
present
volume
with
three
exceptions
are
either
popular
lectures
or
addresses
delivered
to
scientific
bodies
with
which
i
have
been
officially
connected
i
am
not
sure
which
gave
me
the
more
trouble
for
i
have
not
been
one
of
those
fortunate
persons
who
are
able
to
regard
a
popular
lecture
as
a
mere
unworthy
of
being
ranked
among
the
serious
efforts
of
a
philosopher
and
who
keep
their
fame
as
scientific
hierophants
unsullied
by
attempts
at
least
of
the
successful
sort
to
be
understanded
of
the
people
on
the
contrary
i
found
that
the
task
of
putting
the
truths
learned
in
the
field
the
laboratory
and
the
museum
into
language
which
without
bating
a
jot
of
scientific
accuracy
shall
be
generally
intelligible
taxed
such
scientific
and
literary
faculty
as
i
possessed
to
the
uttermost
indeed
my
experience
has
furnished
me
with
no
better
corrective
of
the
tendency
to
scholastic
pedantry
which
besets
all
those
who
are
absorbed
in
pursuits
remote
from
the
common
ways
of
men
and
become
habituated
to
think
and
speak
in
the
technical
dialect
of
their
own
little
world
as
if
there
were
no
other
if
the
popular
lecture
thus
as
i
believe
finds
one
moiety
of
its
justification
in
the
of
the
lecturer
it
surely
finds
the
other
half
in
its
effect
on
the
auditory
for
though
various
sadly
comical
experiences
of
the
results
of
my
own
efforts
have
led
me
to
entertain
a
very
moderate
estimate
of
the
purely
intellectual
value
of
lectures
though
i
venture
to
doubt
if
more
than
one
in
ten
of
an
average
audience
carries
away
an
accurate
notion
of
what
the
speaker
has
been
driving
at
yet
is
that
not
equally
true
of
the
oratory
of
the
hustings
of
the
house
of
commons
and
even
of
the
pulpit
yet
the
children
of
this
world
are
wise
in
their
generation
and
both
the
politician
and
the
priest
are
justified
by
results
the
living
voice
has
an
influence
over
human
action
altogether
independent
of
the
intellectual
worth
of
that
which
it
utters
many
years
ago
i
was
a
guest
at
a
great
city
dinner
a
famous
orator
endowed
with
a
voice
of
rare
flexibility
and
power
a
born
actor
ranging
with
ease
through
every
part
from
refined
comedy
to
tragic
unction
was
called
upon
to
reply
to
a
toast
the
orator
was
a
very
busy
man
a
charming
conversationalist
and
by
no
means
despised
a
good
dinner
and
i
imagine
rose
without
having
given
a
thought
to
what
he
was
going
to
say
the
rhythmic
roll
of
sound
was
admirable
the
gestures
perfect
the
earnestness
impressive
nothing
was
lacking
save
sense
and
occasionally
grammar
when
the
speaker
sat
down
the
applause
was
terrific
and
one
of
my
neighbours
was
especially
enthusiastic
so
when
he
had
quieted
down
i
asked
him
what
the
orator
had
said
and
he
could
not
tell
me
that
sagacious
person
john
wesley
is
reported
to
have
replied
to
some
one
who
questioned
the
propriety
of
his
adaptation
of
sacred
words
to
extremely
secular
airs
that
he
did
not
see
why
the
devil
should
be
left
in
possession
of
all
the
best
tunes
and
i
do
not
see
why
science
should
not
turn
to
account
the
peculiarities
of
human
nature
thus
exploited
by
other
agencies
all
the
more
because
science
by
the
nature
of
its
being
can
not
desire
to
stir
the
passions
or
profit
by
the
weaknesses
of
human
nature
the
most
zealous
of
popular
lecturers
can
aim
at
nothing
more
than
the
awakening
of
a
sympathy
for
abstract
truth
in
those
who
do
not
really
follow
his
arguments
and
of
a
desire
to
know
more
and
better
in
the
few
who
do
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
popularization
of
science
whether
by
lecture
or
essay
has
its
drawbacks
success
in
this
department
has
its
perils
for
those
who
succeed
the
people
who
fail
take
their
revenge
as
we
have
recently
had
occasion
to
observe
by
ignoring
all
the
rest
of
a
man
work
and
glibly
labelling
him
a
more
popularizer
if
the
falsehood
were
not
too
glaring
they
would
say
the
same
of
faraday
and
helmholtz
and
kelvin
on
the
other
hand
of
the
affliction
caused
by
persons
who
think
that
what
they
have
picked
up
from
popular
exposition
qualifies
them
for
discussing
the
great
problems
of
science
it
may
be
said
as
the
radical
toast
said
of
the
power
of
the
crown
in
bygone
days
that
it
has
increased
is
increasing
and
ought
to
be
diminished
the
oddities
of
english
as
she
is
spoke
might
be
abundantly
paralleled
by
those
of
science
as
she
is
misunderstood
in
the
sermon
the
novel
and
the
leading
article
and
a
collection
of
the
grotesque
travesties
of
scientific
conceptions
in
the
shape
of
essays
on
such
trifles
as
the
nature
of
life
and
the
origin
of
all
things
which
reach
me
from
time
to
time
might
well
be
bound
up
with
them
the
tenth
essay
in
this
volume
unfortunately
brought
me
i
will
not
say
into
collision
but
into
a
position
of
critical
remonstrance
with
regard
to
some
charges
of
physical
heterodoxy
brought
by
my
distinguished
friend
lord
kelvin
against
british
geology
as
president
of
the
geological
society
of
london
at
that
time
i
thought
i
might
venture
to
plead
that
we
were
not
such
heretics
as
we
seemed
to
be
and
that
even
if
we
were
recantation
would
not
affect
the
question
of
evolution
i
am
glad
to
see
that
lord
kelvin
has
just
reprinted
his
reply
to
my
plea
and
i
refer
the
reader
to
it
i
shall
not
presume
to
question
anything
that
on
such
ripe
consideration
lord
kelvin
has
to
say
upon
the
physical
problems
involved
but
i
may
remark
that
no
one
can
have
asserted
more
strongly
than
i
have
done
the
necessity
of
looking
to
physics
and
mathematics
for
help
in
regard
to
the
earliest
history
of
the
globe
see
pp
and
of
this
volume
footnote
lectures
and
ii
macmillan
and
co
and
i
take
the
opportunity
of
repeating
the
opinion
that
whether
what
we
call
geological
time
has
the
lower
limit
assigned
to
it
by
lord
kelvin
or
the
higher
assumed
by
other
philosophers
whether
the
germs
of
all
living
things
have
originated
in
the
globe
itself
or
whether
they
have
been
imported
on
or
in
meteorites
from
without
the
problem
of
the
origin
of
those
successive
faunae
and
florae
of
the
earth
the
existence
of
which
is
fully
demonstrated
by
paleontology
remains
exactly
where
it
was
for
i
think
it
will
be
admitted
that
the
germs
brought
to
us
by
meteorites
if
any
were
not
ova
of
elephants
nor
of
crocodiles
not
nor
acorns
not
even
eggs
of
and
corals
but
only
those
of
the
lowest
forms
of
animal
and
vegetable
life
therefore
since
it
is
proved
that
from
a
very
remote
epoch
of
geological
time
the
earth
has
been
peopled
by
a
continual
succession
of
the
higher
forms
of
animals
and
plants
these
either
must
have
been
created
or
they
have
arisen
by
evolution
and
in
respect
of
certain
groups
of
animals
the
established
facts
of
paleontology
leave
no
rational
doubt
that
they
arose
by
the
latter
method
in
the
second
place
there
are
no
data
whatever
which
justify
the
biologist
in
assigning
any
even
approximately
definite
period
of
time
either
long
or
short
to
the
evolution
of
one
species
from
another
by
the
process
of
variation
and
selection
in
the
ninth
of
the
following
essays
i
have
taken
pains
to
prove
that
the
change
of
animals
has
gone
on
at
very
different
rates
in
different
groups
of
living
beings
that
some
types
have
persisted
with
little
change
from
the
paleozoic
epoch
till
now
while
others
have
changed
rapidly
within
the
limits
of
an
epoch
in
see
below
in
vol
and
again
in
i
argued
not
as
a
matter
of
speculation
but
from
paleontological
facts
the
bearing
of
which
i
believe
up
to
that
time
had
not
been
shown
that
any
adequate
hypothesis
of
the
causes
of
evolution
must
be
consistent
with
progression
stationariness
and
retrogression
of
the
same
type
at
different
epochs
of
different
types
in
the
same
epoch
and
that
darwin
hypothesis
fulfilled
these
conditions
according
to
that
hypothesis
two
factors
are
at
work
variation
and
selection
next
to
nothing
is
known
of
the
causes
of
the
former
process
nothing
whatever
of
the
time
required
for
the
production
of
a
certain
amount
of
deviation
from
the
existing
type
and
as
respects
selection
which
operates
by
extinguishing
all
but
a
small
minority
of
variations
we
have
not
the
slightest
means
of
estimating
the
rapidity
with
which
it
does
its
work
all
that
we
are
justified
in
saying
is
that
the
rate
at
which
it
takes
place
may
vary
almost
indefinitely
if
the
famous
root
of
florida
which
kills
white
pigs
but
not
black
ones
were
abundant
and
certain
in
its
action
black
pigs
might
be
substituted
for
white
in
the
course
of
two
or
three
years
if
on
the
other
hand
it
was
rare
and
uncertain
in
action
the
white
pigs
might
linger
on
for
centuries

on
a
piece
of
chalk
if
a
well
were
sunk
at
our
feet
in
the
midst
of
the
city
of
norwich
the
diggers
would
very
soon
find
themselves
at
work
in
that
white
substance
almost
too
soft
to
be
called
rock
with
which
we
are
all
familiar
as
chalk
not
only
here
but
over
the
whole
county
of
norfolk
the
might
carry
his
shaft
down
many
hundred
feet
without
coming
to
the
end
of
the
chalk
and
on
the
where
the
waves
have
pared
away
the
face
of
the
land
which
breasts
them
the
scarped
faces
of
the
high
cliffs
are
often
wholly
formed
of
the
same
material
northward
the
chalk
may
be
followed
as
far
as
yorkshire
on
the
south
coast
it
appears
abruptly
in
the
picturesque
western
bays
of
dorset
and
breaks
into
the
needles
of
the
isle
of
wight
while
on
the
shores
of
kent
it
supplies
that
long
line
of
white
cliffs
to
which
england
owes
her
name
of
albion
were
the
thin
soil
which
covers
it
all
washed
away
a
curved
band
of
white
chalk
here
broader
and
there
narrower
might
be
followed
diagonally
across
england
from
lulworth
in
dorset
to
flamborough
head
in
yorkshire
a
distance
of
over
miles
as
the
crow
flies
from
this
band
to
the
north
sea
on
the
east
and
the
channel
on
the
south
the
chalk
is
largely
hidden
by
other
deposits
but
except
in
the
weald
of
kent
and
sussex
it
enters
into
the
very
foundation
of
all
the
counties
attaining
as
it
does
in
some
places
a
thickness
of
more
than
a
thousand
feet
the
english
chalk
must
be
admitted
to
be
a
mass
of
considerable
magnitude
nevertheless
it
covers
but
an
insignificant
portion
of
the
whole
area
occupied
by
the
chalk
formation
of
the
globe
much
of
which
has
the
same
general
characters
as
ours
and
is
found
in
detached
patches
some
less
and
others
more
extensive
than
the
english
chalk
occurs
in
ireland
it
stretches
over
a
large
part
of
france
the
chalk
which
underlies
paris
being
in
fact
a
continuation
of
that
of
the
london
basin
it
runs
through
denmark
and
central
europe
and
extends
southward
to
north
africa
while
eastward
it
appears
in
the
crimea
and
in
syria
and
may
be
traced
as
far
as
the
shores
of
the
sea
of
aral
in
central
asia
if
all
the
points
at
which
true
chalk
occurs
were
circumscribed
they
would
lie
within
an
irregular
oval
about
miles
in
long
diameter
the
area
of
which
would
be
as
great
as
that
of
europe
and
would
many
times
exceed
that
of
the
largest
existing
inland
sea
the
mediterranean
thus
the
chalk
is
no
unimportant
element
in
the
masonry
of
the
crust
and
it
impresses
a
peculiar
stamp
varying
with
the
conditions
to
which
it
is
exposed
on
the
scenery
of
the
districts
in
which
it
occurs
the
undulating
downs
and
rounded
coombs
covered
with
turf
of
our
inland
chalk
country
have
a
peacefully
domestic
and
suggesting
prettiness
but
can
hardly
be
called
either
grand
or
beautiful
but
on
our
southern
coasts
the
cliffs
many
hundred
feet
high
with
vast
needles
and
pinnacles
standing
out
in
the
sea
sharp
and
solitary
enough
to
serve
as
perches
for
the
wary
cormorant
confer
a
wonderful
beauty
and
grandeur
upon
the
chalk
headlands
and
in
the
east
chalk
has
its
share
in
the
formation
of
some
of
the
most
venerable
of
mountain
ranges
such
as
the
lebanon
what
is
this
component
of
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
whence
did
it
come
you
may
think
this
no
very
hopeful
inquiry
you
may
not
unnaturally
suppose
that
the
attempt
to
solve
such
problems
as
these
can
lead
to
no
result
save
that
of
entangling
the
inquirer
in
vague
speculations
incapable
of
refutation
and
of
verification
if
such
were
really
the
case
i
should
have
selected
some
other
subject
than
a
piece
of
chalk
for
my
discourse
but
in
truth
after
much
deliberation
i
have
been
unable
to
think
of
any
topic
which
would
so
well
enable
me
to
lead
you
to
see
how
solid
is
the
foundation
upon
which
some
of
the
most
startling
conclusions
of
physical
science
rest
a
great
chapter
of
the
history
of
the
world
is
written
in
the
chalk
few
passages
in
the
history
of
man
can
be
supported
by
such
an
overwhelming
mass
of
direct
and
indirect
evidence
as
that
which
testifies
to
the
truth
of
the
fragment
of
the
history
of
the
globe
which
i
hope
to
enable
you
to
read
with
your
own
eyes
let
me
add
that
few
chapters
of
human
history
have
a
more
profound
significance
for
ourselves
i
weigh
my
words
well
when
i
assert
that
the
man
who
should
know
the
true
history
of
the
bit
of
chalk
which
every
carpenter
carries
about
in
his
pocket
though
ignorant
of
all
other
history
is
likely
if
he
will
think
his
knowledge
out
to
its
ultimate
results
to
have
a
truer
and
therefore
a
better
conception
of
this
wonderful
universe
and
of
man
relation
to
it
than
the
most
learned
student
who
is
in
the
records
of
humanity
and
ignorant
of
those
of
nature
the
language
of
the
chalk
is
not
hard
to
learn
not
nearly
so
hard
as
latin
if
you
only
want
to
get
at
the
broad
features
of
the
story
it
has
to
tell
and
i
propose
that
we
now
set
to
work
to
spell
that
story
out
together
we
all
know
that
if
we
burn
chalk
the
result
is
quicklime
chalk
in
fact
is
a
compound
of
carbonic
acid
gas
and
lime
and
when
you
make
it
very
hot
the
carbonic
acid
flies
away
and
the
lime
is
left
by
this
method
of
procedure
we
see
the
lime
but
we
do
not
see
the
carbonic
acid
if
on
the
other
hand
you
were
to
powder
a
little
chalk
and
drop
it
into
a
good
deal
of
strong
vinegar
there
would
be
a
great
bubbling
and
fizzing
and
finally
a
clear
liquid
in
which
no
sign
of
chalk
would
appear
here
you
see
the
carbonic
acid
in
the
bubbles
the
lime
dissolved
in
the
vinegar
vanishes
from
sight
there
are
a
great
many
other
ways
of
showing
that
chalk
is
essentially
nothing
but
carbonic
acid
and
quicklime
chemists
enunciate
the
result
of
all
the
experiments
which
prove
this
by
stating
that
chalk
is
almost
wholly
composed
of
carbonate
of
lime
it
is
desirable
for
us
to
start
from
the
knowledge
of
this
fact
though
it
may
not
seem
to
help
us
very
far
towards
what
we
seek
for
carbonate
of
lime
is
a
substance
and
is
met
with
under
very
various
conditions
all
sorts
of
limestones
are
composed
of
more
or
less
pure
carbonate
of
lime
the
crust
which
is
often
deposited
by
waters
which
have
drained
through
limestone
rocks
in
the
form
of
what
are
called
stalagmites
and
stalactites
is
carbonate
of
lime
or
to
take
a
more
familiar
example
the
fur
on
the
inside
of
a
is
carbonate
of
lime
and
for
anything
chemistry
tells
us
to
the
contrary
the
chalk
might
be
a
kind
of
gigantic
fur
upon
the
bottom
of
the
which
is
kept
pretty
hot
below
let
us
try
another
method
of
making
the
chalk
tell
us
its
own
history
to
the
unassisted
eye
chalk
looks
simply
like
a
very
loose
and
open
kind
of
stone
but
it
is
possible
to
grind
a
slice
of
chalk
down
so
thin
that
you
can
see
through
it
until
it
is
thin
enough
in
fact
to
be
examined
with
any
magnifying
power
that
may
be
thought
desirable
a
thin
slice
of
the
fur
of
a
kettle
might
be
made
in
the
same
way
if
it
were
examined
microscopically
it
would
show
itself
to
be
a
more
or
less
distinctly
laminated
mineral
substance
and
nothing
more
but
the
slice
of
chalk
presents
a
totally
different
appearance
when
placed
under
the
microscope
the
general
mass
of
it
is
made
up
of
very
minute
granules
but
imbedded
in
this
matrix
are
innumerable
bodies
some
smaller
and
some
larger
but
on
a
rough
average
not
more
than
a
hundredth
of
an
inch
in
diameter
having
a
shape
and
structure
a
cubic
inch
of
some
specimens
of
chalk
may
contain
hundreds
of
thousands
of
these
bodies
compacted
together
with
incalculable
millions
of
the
granules
the
examination
of
a
transparent
slice
gives
a
good
notion
of
the
manner
in
which
the
components
of
the
chalk
are
arranged
and
of
their
relative
proportions
but
by
rubbing
up
some
chalk
with
a
brush
in
water
and
then
pouring
off
the
milky
fluid
so
as
to
obtain
sediments
of
different
degrees
of
fineness
the
granules
and
the
minute
rounded
bodies
may
be
pretty
well
separated
from
one
another
and
submitted
to
microscopic
examination
either
as
opaque
or
as
transparent
objects
by
combining
the
views
obtained
in
these
various
methods
each
of
the
rounded
bodies
may
be
proved
to
be
a
calcareous
fabric
made
up
of
a
number
of
chambers
communicating
freely
with
one
another
the
chambered
bodies
are
of
various
forms
one
of
the
commonest
is
something
like
a
raspberry
being
formed
of
a
number
of
nearly
globular
chambers
of
different
sizes
congregated
together
it
is
called
and
some
specimens
of
chalk
consist
of
little
else
than
and
granules
let
us
fix
our
attention
upon
the
it
is
the
spoor
of
the
game
we
are
tracking
if
we
can
learn
what
it
is
and
what
are
the
conditions
of
its
existence
we
shall
see
our
way
to
the
origin
and
past
history
of
the
chalk
a
suggestion
which
may
naturally
enough
present
itself
is
that
these
curious
bodies
are
the
result
of
some
process
of
aggregation
which
has
taken
place
in
the
carbonate
of
lime
that
just
as
in
winter
the
rime
on
our
windows
simulates
the
most
delicate
and
elegantly
arborescent
foliage
proving
that
the
mere
mineral
water
may
under
certain
conditions
assume
the
outward
form
of
organic
bodies
so
this
mineral
substance
carbonate
of
lime
hidden
away
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
has
taken
the
shape
of
these
chambered
bodies
i
am
not
raising
a
merely
fanciful
and
unreal
objection
very
learned
men
in
former
days
have
even
entertained
the
notion
that
all
the
formed
things
found
in
rocks
are
of
this
nature
and
if
no
such
conception
is
at
present
held
to
be
admissible
it
is
because
long
and
varied
experience
has
now
shown
that
mineral
matter
never
does
assume
the
form
and
structure
we
find
in
fossils
if
any
one
were
to
try
to
persuade
you
that
an
which
is
also
chiefly
composed
of
carbonate
of
lime
had
crystallized
out
of
i
suppose
you
would
laugh
at
the
absurdity
your
laughter
would
be
justified
by
the
fact
that
all
experience
tends
to
show
that
are
formed
by
the
agency
of
oysters
and
in
no
other
way
and
if
there
were
no
better
reasons
we
should
be
justified
on
like
grounds
in
believing
that
is
not
the
product
of
anything
but
vital
activity
happily
however
better
evidence
in
proof
of
the
organic
nature
of
the
than
that
of
analogy
is
forthcoming
it
so
happens
that
calcareous
skeletons
exactly
similar
to
the
of
the
chalk
are
being
formed
at
the
present
moment
by
minute
living
creatures
which
flourish
in
multitudes
literally
more
numerous
than
the
sands
of
the
over
a
large
extent
of
that
part
of
the
earth
surface
which
is
covered
by
the
ocean
the
history
of
the
discovery
of
these
living
and
of
the
part
which
they
play
in
rock
building
is
singular
enough
it
is
a
discovery
which
like
others
of
no
less
scientific
importance
has
arisen
incidentally
out
of
work
devoted
to
very
different
and
exceedingly
practical
interests
when
men
first
took
to
the
sea
they
speedily
learned
to
look
out
for
shoals
and
rocks
and
the
more
the
burthen
of
their
ships
increased
the
more
imperatively
necessary
it
became
for
sailors
to
ascertain
with
precision
the
depth
of
the
waters
they
traversed
out
of
this
necessity
grew
the
use
of
the
lead
and
sounding
line
and
ultimately
which
is
the
recording
of
the
form
of
coasts
and
of
the
depth
of
the
sea
as
ascertained
by
the
upon
charts
at
the
same
time
it
became
desirable
to
ascertain
and
to
indicate
the
nature
of
the
since
this
circumstance
greatly
affects
its
goodness
as
holding
ground
for
anchors
some
ingenious
tar
whose
name
deserves
a
better
fate
than
the
oblivion
into
which
it
has
fallen
attained
this
object
by
arming
the
bottom
of
the
lead
with
a
lump
of
grease
to
which
more
or
less
of
the
sand
or
mud
or
broken
shells
as
the
case
might
be
adhered
and
was
brought
to
the
surface
but
however
well
adapted
such
an
apparatus
might
be
for
rough
nautical
purposes
scientific
accuracy
could
not
be
expected
from
the
armed
lead
and
to
remedy
its
defects
especially
when
applied
to
sounding
in
great
depths
lieut
brooke
of
the
american
navy
some
years
ago
invented
a
most
ingenious
machine
by
which
a
considerable
portion
of
the
superficial
layer
of
the
can
be
scooped
out
and
brought
up
from
any
depth
to
which
the
lead
descends
in
lieut
brooke
obtained
mud
from
the
bottom
of
the
north
atlantic
between
newfoundland
and
the
azores
at
a
depth
of
more
than
feet
or
two
miles
by
the
help
of
this
sounding
apparatus
the
specimens
were
sent
for
examination
to
ehrenberg
of
berlin
and
to
bailey
of
west
point
and
those
able
microscopists
found
that
this
mud
was
almost
entirely
composed
of
the
skeletons
of
living
organisms
the
greater
proportion
of
these
being
just
like
the
already
known
to
occur
in
the
chalk
thus
far
the
work
had
been
carried
on
simply
in
the
interests
of
science
but
lieut
brooke
method
of
sounding
acquired
a
high
commercial
value
when
the
enterprise
of
laying
down
the
between
this
country
and
the
united
states
was
undertaken
for
it
became
a
matter
of
immense
importance
to
know
not
only
the
depth
of
the
sea
over
the
whole
line
along
which
the
cable
was
to
be
laid
but
the
exact
nature
of
the
bottom
so
as
to
guard
against
chances
of
cutting
or
fraying
the
strands
of
that
costly
rope
the
admiralty
consequently
ordered
captain
dayman
an
old
friend
and
shipmate
of
mine
to
ascertain
the
depth
over
the
whole
line
of
the
cable
and
to
bring
back
specimens
of
the
bottom
in
former
days
such
a
command
as
this
might
have
sounded
very
much
like
one
of
the
impossible
things
which
the
young
prince
in
the
fairy
tales
is
ordered
to
do
before
he
can
obtain
the
hand
of
the
princess
however
in
the
months
of
june
and
july
my
friend
performed
the
task
assigned
to
him
with
great
expedition
and
precision
without
so
far
as
i
know
having
met
with
any
reward
of
that
kind
the
specimens
or
atlantic
mud
which
he
procured
were
sent
to
me
to
be
examined
and
reported

soundings
in
the
north
atlantic
ocean
between
ireland
and
newfoundland
made
in
published
by
order
of
the
lords
commissioners
of
the
admiralty
they
have
since
formed
the
subject
of
an
elaborate
memoir
by
parker
and
jones
published
in
the
for
the
result
of
all
these
operations
is
that
we
know
the
contours
and
the
nature
of
the
covered
by
the
north
atlantic
for
a
distance
of
miles
from
east
to
west
as
well
as
we
know
that
of
any
part
of
the
dry
land
it
is
a
prodigious
plain
one
of
the
widest
and
most
even
plains
in
the
world
if
the
sea
were
drained
off
you
might
drive
a
waggon
all
the
way
from
valentia
on
the
west
coast
of
ireland
to
trinity
bay
in
newfoundland
and
except
upon
one
sharp
incline
about
miles
from
valentia
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
it
would
even
be
necessary
to
put
the
skid
on
so
gentle
are
the
ascents
and
descents
upon
that
long
route
from
valentia
the
road
would
lie
for
about
miles
to
the
point
at
which
the
bottom
is
now
covered
by
fathoms
of
then
would
come
the
central
plain
more
than
a
thousand
miles
wide
the
inequalities
of
the
surface
of
which
would
be
hardly
perceptible
though
the
depth
of
water
upon
it
now
varies
from
to
feet
and
there
are
places
in
which
mont
blanc
might
be
sunk
without
showing
its
peak
above
water
beyond
this
the
ascent
on
the
american
side
commences
and
gradually
leads
for
about
miles
to
the
newfoundland
shore
almost
the
whole
of
the
bottom
of
this
central
plain
which
extends
for
many
hundred
miles
in
a
north
and
south
direction
is
covered
by
a
fine
mud
which
when
brought
to
the
surface
dries
into
a
greyish
white
friable
substance
you
can
write
with
this
on
a
blackboard
if
you
are
so
inclined
and
to
the
eye
it
is
quite
like
very
soft
grayish
chalk
examined
chemically
it
proves
to
be
composed
almost
wholly
of
carbonate
of
lime
and
if
you
make
a
section
of
it
in
the
same
way
as
that
of
the
piece
of
chalk
was
made
and
view
it
with
the
microscope
it
presents
innumerable
embedded
in
a
granular
matrix
thus
this
sea
mud
is
substantially
chalk
i
say
substantially
because
there
are
a
good
many
minor
differences
but
as
these
have
no
bearing
on
the
question
immediately
before
us
which
is
the
nature
of
the
of
the
chalk
it
is
unnecessary
to
speak
of
them
of
every
size
from
the
smallest
to
the
largest
are
associated
together
in
the
atlantic
mud
and
the
chambers
of
many
are
filled
by
a
soft
animal
matter
this
soft
substance
is
in
fact
the
remains
of
the
creature
to
which
the
shell
or
rather
skeleton
owes
its
existence
and
which
is
an
animal
of
the
simplest
imaginable
description
it
is
in
fact
a
mere
particle
of
living
jelly
without
defined
parts
of
any
kind
without
a
mouth
nerves
muscles
or
distinct
organs
and
only
manifesting
its
vitality
to
ordinary
observation
by
thrusting
out
and
retracting
from
all
parts
of
its
surface
long
filamentous
processes
which
serve
for
arms
and
legs
yet
this
amorphous
particle
devoid
of
everything
which
in
the
higher
animals
we
call
organs
is
capable
of
feeding
growing
and
multiplying
of
separating
from
the
ocean
the
small
proportion
of
carbonate
of
lime
which
is
dissolved
in
and
of
building
up
that
substance
into
a
skeleton
for
itself
according
to
a
pattern
which
can
be
imitated
by
no
other
known
agency
the
notion
that
animals
can
live
and
flourish
in
the
sea
at
the
vast
depths
from
which
apparently
living
have
been
brought
up
does
not
agree
very
well
with
our
usual
conceptions
respecting
the
conditions
of
animal
life
and
it
is
not
so
absolutely
impossible
as
it
might
at
first
sight
appear
to
be
that
the
of
the
atlantic
do
not
live
and
die
where
they
are
found
as
i
have
mentioned
the
soundings
from
the
great
atlantic
plain
are
almost
entirely
made
up
of
with
the
granules
which
have
been
mentioned
and
some
few
other
calcareous
shells
but
a
small
percentage
of
the
chalky
mud
perhaps
at
most
some
five
per
cent
of
it
is
of
a
different
nature
and
consists
of
shells
and
skeletons
composed
of
silex
or
pure
flint
these
silicious
bodies
belong
partly
to
the
lowly
vegetable
organisms
which
are
called
and
partly
to
the
minute
and
extremely
simple
animals
termed
it
is
quite
certain
that
these
creatures
do
not
live
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
but
at
its
surface
where
they
may
be
obtained
in
prodigious
numbers
by
the
use
of
a
properly
constructed
net
hence
it
follows
that
these
silicious
organisms
though
they
are
not
heavier
than
the
lightest
dust
must
have
fallen
in
some
cases
through
fifteen
thousand
feet
of
water
before
they
reached
their
final
on
the
ocean
floor
and
considering
how
large
a
surface
these
bodies
expose
in
proportion
to
their
weight
it
is
probable
that
they
occupy
a
great
length
of
time
in
making
their
burial
journey
from
the
surface
of
the
atlantic
to
the
bottom
but
if
the
and
diatoms
are
thus
rained
upon
the
bottom
of
the
sea
from
the
superficial
layer
of
its
waters
in
which
they
pass
their
lives
it
is
obviously
possible
that
the
may
be
similarly
derived
and
if
they
were
so
it
would
be
much
more
easy
to
understand
how
they
obtain
their
supply
of
food
than
it
is
at
present
nevertheless
the
positive
and
negative
evidence
all
points
the
other
way
the
skeletons
of
the
are
so
remarkably
solid
and
heavy
in
proportion
to
their
surface
as
to
seem
little
fitted
for
floating
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
are
not
to
be
found
along
with
the
diatoms
and
in
the
uppermost
stratum
of
the
open
ocean
it
has
been
observed
again
that
the
abundance
of
in
proportion
to
other
organisms
of
like
kind
increases
with
the
depth
of
the
sea
and
that
are
larger
than
those
which
live
in
shallower
parts
of
the
sea
and
such
facts
negative
the
supposition
that
these
organisms
have
been
swept
by
currents
from
the
shallows
into
the
deeps
of
the
atlantic
it
therefore
seems
to
be
hardly
doubtful
that
these
wonderful
creatures
live
and
die
at
the
depths
in
which
they
are
found
footnote
during
the
cruise
of
commanded
by
sir
leopold
in
living
were
brought
up
clinging
to
the
lowest
part
of
the

a
depth
of
fathoms
midway
between
cape

and
the
rockall

ascertained
that
the

this
point
consisted
of
the
ordinary
ooze
and
that
the
stomachs
of
the
were
full
of
this
discovery
removes
all
objections
to
the
existence
of
living
at
great
depths
which
are
based
upon
the
supposed
difficulty
of
maintaining
animal
life
under
such
conditions
and
it
throws
the
burden
of
proof
upon
those
who
object
to
the
supposition
that
the
live
and
die
where
they
are
found
however
the
important
points
for
us
are
that
the
living
are
exclusively
marine
animals
the
skeletons
of
which
abound
at
the
bottom
of
deep
seas
and
that
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
reason
for
believing
that
the
habits
of
the
of
the
chalk
differed
from
those
of
the
existing
species
but
if
this
be
true
there
is
no
escaping
the
conclusion
that
the
chalk
itself
is
the
dried
mud
of
an
ancient
deep
sea
in
working
over
the
soundings
collected
by
captain
dayman
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
many
of
what
i
have
called
the
granules
of
that
mud
were
not
as
one
might
have
been
tempted
to
think
at
first
the
more
powder
and
waste
of
but
that
they
had
a
definite
form
and
size
i
termed
these
bodies
and
doubted
their
organic
nature
wallich
verified
my
observation
and
added
the
interesting
discovery
that
not
unfrequently
bodies
similar
to
these
coccoliths
were
aggregated
together
into
spheroids
which
lie
termed
so
far
as
we
knew
these
bodies
the
nature
of
which
is
extremely
puzzling
and
problematical
were
peculiar
to
the
atlantic
soundings
but
a
few
years
ago
sorby
in
making
a
careful
examination
of
the
chalk
by
means
of
thin
sections
and
otherwise
observed
as
ehrenberg
had
done
before
him
that
much
of
its
granular
basis
possesses
a
definite
form
comparing
these
formed
particles
with
those
in
the
atlantic
soundings
he
found
the
two
to
be
identical
and
thus
proved
that
the
chalk
like
the
surroundings
contains
these
mysterious
coccoliths
and
coccospheres
here
was
a
further
and
most
interesting
confirmation
from
internal
evidence
of
the
essential
identity
of
the
chalk
with
modern
mud
coccoliths
and
coccospheres
are
found
as
the
chief
constituents
of
both
and
testify
to
the
general
similarity
of
the
conditions
under
which
both
have
been
formed
footnote
i
have
recently
traced
out
the
development
of
the
coccoliths
from
a
diameter
of
of
an
inch
up
to
their
largest
size
which
is
about
and
no
longer
doubt
that
they
are
produced
by
independent
organisms
which
like
the
live
and
die
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
the
evidence
furnished
by
the
hewing
facing
and
superposition
of
the
stones
of
the
pyramids
that
these
structures
were
built
by
men
has
no
greater
weight
than
the
evidence
that
the
chalk
was
built
by
and
the
belief
that
those
ancient
were
terrestrial
and
creatures
like
ourselves
is
not
better
based
than
the
conviction
that
the
lived
in
the
sea
but
as
our
belief
in
the
building
of
the
pyramids
by
men
is
not
only
grounded
on
the
internal
evidence
afforded
by
these
structures
but
gathers
strength
from
multitudinous
collateral
proofs
and
is
clinched
by
the
total
absence
of
any
reason
for
a
contrary
belief
so
the
evidence
drawn
from
the
that
the
chalk
is
an
ancient
is
fortified
by
innumerable
independent
lines
of
evidence
and
our
belief
in
the
truth
of
the
conclusion
to
which
all
positive
testimony
tends
receives
the
like
negative
justification
from
the
fact
that
no
other
hypothesis
has
a
shadow
of
foundation
it
may
be
worth
while
briefly
to
consider
a
few
of
these
collateral
proofs
that
the
chalk
was
deposited
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
the
great
mass
of
the
chalk
is
composed
as
we
have
seen
of
the
skeletons
of
and
other
simple
organisms
imbedded
in
granular
matter
here
and
there
however
this
hardened
mud
of
the
ancient
sea
reveals
the
remains
of
higher
animals
which
have
lived
and
died
and
left
their
hard
parts
in
the
mud
just
as
the
oysters
die
and
leave
their
shells
behind
them
in
the
mud
of
the
present
seas
there
are
at
the
present
day
certain
groups
of
animals
which
are
never
found
in
fresh
waters
being
unable
to
live
anywhere
but
in
the
sea
such
are
the
corals
those
corallines
which
are
called
those
creatures
which
fabricate
the
and
are
called
the
pearly
and
all
animals
allied
to
it
and
all
the
forms
of
and
not
only
are
all
these
creatures
confined
to
salt
water
at
the
present
day
but
so
far
as
our
records
of
the
past
go
the
conditions
of
their
existence
have
been
the
same
hence
their
occurrence
in
any
deposit
is
as
strong
evidence
as
can
be
obtained
that
that
deposit
was
formed
in
the
sea
now
the
remains
of
animals
of
all
the
kinds
which
have
been
enumerated
occur
in
the
chalk
in
greater
or
less
abundance
while
not
one
of
those
forms
of
which
are
characteristic
of
fresh
water
has
yet
been
observed
in
it
when
we
consider
that
the
remains
of
more
than
three
thousand
distinct
species
of
aquatic
animals
have
been
discovered
among
the
fossils
of
the
chalk
that
the
great
majority
of
them
are
of
such
forms
as
are
now
met
with
only
in
the
sea
and
that
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
any
one
of
them
inhabited
fresh
water
the
collateral
evidence
that
the
chalk
represents
an
ancient
acquires
as
great
force
as
the
proof
derived
from
the
nature
of
the
chalk
itself
i
think
you
will
now
allow
that
i
did
not
overstate
my
case
when
i
asserted
that
we
have
as
strong
grounds
for
believing
that
all
the
vast
area
of
dry
land
at
present
occupied
by
the
chalk
was
once
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
as
we
have
for
any
matter
of
history
whatever
while
there
is
no
justification
for
any
other
belief
no
less
certain
it
is
that
the
time
during
which
the
countries
we
now
call
england
france
germany
poland
russia
egypt
arabia
syria
were
more
or
less
completely
covered
by
a
deep
sea
was
of
considerable
duration
we
have
already
seen
that
the
chalk
is
in
places
more
than
a
thousand
feet
thick
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
it
must
have
taken
some
time
for
the
skeletons
of
animalcules
of
a
hundredth
of
an
inch
in
diameter
to
heap
up
such
a
mass
as
that
i
have
said
that
throughout
the
thickness
of
the
chalk
the
remains
of
other
animals
are
scattered
these
remains
are
often
in
the
most
exquisite
state
of
preservation
the
valves
of
the
are
commonly
adherent
the
long
spines
of
some
of
the
which
would
be
detached
by
the
smallest
jar
often
remain
in
their
places
in
a
word
it
is
certain
that
these
animals
have
lived
and
died
when
the
place
which
they
now
occupy
was
the
surface
of
as
much
of
the
chalk
as
had
then
been
deposited
and
that
each
has
been
covered
up
by
the
layer
of
mud
upon
which
the
creatures
imbedded
a
little
higher
up
have
in
like
manner
lived
and
died
but
some
of
these
remains
prove
the
existence
of
reptiles
of
vast
size
in
the
chalk
sea
these
lived
their
time
and
had
their
ancestors
and
descendants
which
assuredly
implies
time
reptiles
being
of
slow
growth
there
is
more
curious
evidence
again
that
the
process
of
covering
up
or
in
other
words
the
deposit
of
skeletons
did
not
go
on
very
fast
it
is
demonstrable
that
an
animal
of
the
cretaceous
sea
might
die
that
its
skeleton
might
lie
uncovered
upon
the
long
enough
to
lose
all
its
outward
coverings
and
appendages
by
putrefaction
and
that
after
this
had
happened
another
animal
might
attach
itself
to
the
dead
and
naked
skeleton
might
grow
to
maturity
and
might
itself
die
before
the
calcareous
mud
had
buried
the
whole
cases
of
this
kind
are
admirably
described
by
sir
charles
lyell
he
speaks
of
the
frequency
with
which
geologists
find
in
the
chalk
a
fossilized
to
which
is
attached
the
lower
valve
of
a
this
is
a
kind
of
with
a
shell
composed
of
two
pieces
of
which
as
in
the
oyster
one
is
fixed
and
the
other
free
the
upper
valve
is
almost
invariably
wanting
though
occasionally
found
in
a
perfect
state
of
preservation
in
the
white
chalk
at
some
distance
in
this
case
we
see
clearly
that
the
first
lived
from
youth
to
age
then
died
and
lost
its
spines
which
were
carried
away
then
the
young
adhered
to
the
bared
shell
grew
and
perished
in
its
turn
after
which
the
upper
valve
was
separated
from
the
lower
before
the
echinus
became
enveloped
in
chalky
mud
a
specimen
in
the
museum
of
practical
geology
in
london
still
further
prolongs
the
period
which
must
have
elapsed
between
the
death
of
the
urchin
and
its
burial
by
the
for
the
outward
face
of
the
valve
of

is
attached
to

itself
overrun
by
an
incrusting
coralline
which
spreads
thence
over
more
or
less
of
the
surface
of
the
it
follows
that
after
the
upper
valve
of
the
fell
off
the
surface
of
the
attached
valve
must
have
remained
exposed
long
enough
to
allow
of
the
growth
of
the
whole
coralline
since
corallines
do
not
live
embedded
in
mud
footnote
of
by
sir
charles
lyell
bart
p
the
progress
of
knowledge
may
one
day
enable
us
to
deduce
from
such
facts
as
these
the
maximum
rate
at
which
the
chalk
can
have
accumulated
and
thus
to
arrive
at
the
minimum
duration
of
the
chalk
period
suppose
that
the
valve
of
the
upon
which
a
coralline
has
fixed
itself
in
the
way
just
described
is
so
attached
to
the
that
no
part
of
it
is
more
than
an
inch
above
the
face
upon
which
the
rests
then
as
the
coralline
could
not
have
fixed
itself
if
the
had
been
covered
up
with
chalk
mud
and
could
not
have
lived
had
itself
been
so
covered
it
follows
that
an
inch
of
chalk
mud
could
not
have
accumulated
within
the
time
between
the
death
and
decay
of
the
soft
parts
of
the
and
the
growth
of
the
coralline
to
the
full
size
which
it
has
attained
if
the
decay
of
the
soft
parts
of
the
the
attachment
growth
to
maturity
and
decay
of
the
and
the
subsequent
attachment
and
growth
of
the
coralline
took
a
year
which
is
a
low
estimate
enough
the
accumulation
of
the
inch
of
chalk
must
have
taken
more
than
a
year
and
the
deposit
of
a
thousand
feet
of
chalk
must
consequently
have
taken
more
than
twelve
thousand
years
the
foundation
of
all
this
calculation
is
of
course
a
knowledge
of
the
length
of
time
the
and
the
coralline
needed
to
attain
their
full
size
and
on
this
head
precise
knowledge
is
at
present
wanting
but
there
are
circumstances
which
tend
to
show
that
nothing
like
an
inch
of
chalk
has
accumulated
during
the
life
of
a
and
on
any
probable
estimate
of
the
length
of
that
life
the
chalk
period
must
have
had
a
much
longer
duration
than
that
thus
roughly
assigned
to
it
thus
not
only
is
it
certain
that
the
chalk
is
the
mud
of
an
ancient
bottom
but
it
is
no
less
certain
that
the
chalk
sea
existed
during
an
extremely
long
period
though
we
may
not
be
prepared
to
give
a
precise
estimate
of
the
length
of
that
period
in
years
the
relative
duration
is
clear
though
the
absolute
duration
may
not
be
definable
the
attempt
to
affix
any
precise
date
to
the
period
at
which
the
chalk
sea
began
or
ended
its
existence
is
baffled
by
difficulties
of
the
same
kind
but
the
relative
age
of
the
cretaceous
epoch
may
be
determined
with
as
great
ease
and
certainty
as
the
long
duration
of
that
epoch
you
will
have
heard
of
the
interesting
discoveries
recently
made
in
various
parts
of
western
europe
of
flint
implements
obviously
worked
into
shape
by
human
hands
under
circumstances
which
show
conclusively
that
man
is
a
very
ancient
denizen
of
these
regions
it
has
been
proved
that
the
whole
populations
of
europe
whose
existence
has
been
revealed
to
us
in
this
way
consisted
of
savages
such
as
the
esquimaux
are
now
that
in
the
country
which
is
now
france
they
hunted
the
reindeer
and
were
familiar
with
the
ways
of
the
mammoth
and
the
bison
the
physical
geography
of
france
was
in
those
days
different
from
what
it
is
now
the
river
somme
for
instance
having
cut
its
bed
a
hundred
feet
deeper
between
that
time
and
this
and
it
is
probable
that
the
climate
was
more
like
that
of
canada
or
siberia
than
that
of
western
europe
the
existence
of
these
people
is
forgotten
even
in
the
traditions
of
the
oldest
historical
nations
the
name
and
fame
of
them
had
utterly
vanished
until
a
few
years
back
and
the
amount
of
physical
change
which
has
been
effected
since
their
day
renders
it
more
than
probable
that
venerable
as
are
some
of
the
historical
nations
the
workers
of
the
chipped
flints
of
hoxne
or
of
amiens
are
to
them
as
they
are
to
us
in
point
of
antiquity
but
if
we
assign
to
these
hoar
relics
of
generations
of
men
the
greatest
age
that
can
possibly
be
claimed
for
them
they
are
not
older
than
the
drift
or
boulder
clay
which
in
comparison
with
the
chalk
is
but
a
very
juvenile
deposit
you
need
go
no
further
than
your
own
for
evidence
of
this
fact
at
one
of
the
most
charming
spots
on
the
coast
of
norfolk
cromer
you
will
see
the
boulder
clay
forming
a
vast
mass
which
lies
upon
the
chalk
and
must
consequently
have
come
into
existence
after
it
huge
boulders
of
chalk
are
in
fact
included
in
the
clay
and
have
evidently
been
brought
to
the
position
they
now
occupy
by
the
same
agency
as
that
which
has
planted
blocks
of
syenite
from
norway
side
by
side
with
them
the
chalk
then
is
certainly
older
than
the
boulder
clay
if
you
ask
how
much
i
will
again
take
you
no
further
than
the
same
spot
upon
your
own
coasts
for
evidence
i
have
spoken
of
the
boulder
clay
and
drift
as
resting
upon
the
chalk
that
is
not
strictly
true
interposed
between
the
chalk
and
the
drift
is
a
comparatively
insignificant
layer
containing
vegetable
matter
but
that
layer
tells
a
wonderful
history
it
is
full
of
stumps
of
trees
standing
as
they
grew
are
there
with
their
cones
and
with
their
nuts
there
stand
the
stools
of
oak
and
yew
trees
beeches
and
alders
hence
this
stratum
is
appropriately
called
the
it
is
obvious
that
the
chalk
must
have
been
upheaved
and
converted
into
dry
land
before
the
timber
trees
could
grow
upon
it
as
the
bolls
of
some
of
these
trees
are
from
two
to
three
feet
in
diameter
it
is
no
less
clear
that
the
dry
land
thus
formed
remained
in
the
same
condition
for
long
ages
and
not
only
do
the
remains
of
stately
oaks
and
firs
testify
to
the
duration
of
this
condition
of
things
but
additional
evidence
to
the
same
effect
is
afforded
by
the
abundant
remains
of
elephants
rhinoceroses
hippopotamuses
and
other
great
wild
beasts
which
it
has
yielded
to
the
zealous
search
of
such
men
as
the
rev
gunn
when
you
look
at
such
a
collection
as
he
has
formed
and
bethink
you
that
these
elephantine
bones
did
veritably
carry
their
owners
about
and
these
great
grinders
crunch
in
the
dark
woods
of
which
the
bed
is
now
the
only
trace
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
that
they
are
as
good
evidence
of
the
lapse
of
time
as
the
annual
rings
of
the
tree
stumps
thus
there
is
a
writing
upon
the
wall
of
cliffs
at
cromer
and
whoso
runs
may
read
it
it
tells
us
with
an
authority
which
can
not
be
impeached
that
the
ancient
of
the
chalk
sea
was
raised
up
and
remained
dry
land
until
it
was
covered
with
forest
stocked
with
the
great
game
the
spoils
of
which
have
rejoiced
your
geologists
how
long
it
remained
in
that
condition
can
not
be
said
but
the
whirligig
of
time
brought
its
revenges
in
those
days
as
in
these
that
dry
land
with
the
bones
and
teeth
of
generations
of
elephants
hidden
away
among
the
gnarled
roots
and
dry
leaves
of
its
ancient
trees
sank
gradually
to
the
bottom
of
the
icy
sea
which
covered
it
with
huge
masses
of
drift
and
boulder
clay
such
as
the
walrus
now
restricted
to
the
extreme
north
paddled
about
where
birds
had
twittered
among
the
topmost
twigs
of
the
how
long
this
state
of
things
endured
we
know
not
but
at
length
it
came
to
an
end
the
upheaved
glacial
mud
hardened
into
the
soil
of
modern
norfolk
forests
grew
once
more
the
wolf
and
the
beaver
replaced
the
reindeer
and
the
elephant
and
at
length
what
we
call
the
history
of
england
dawned
thus
you
have
within
the
limits
of
your
own
county
proof
that
the
chalk
can
justly
claim
a
very
much
greater
antiquity
than
even
the
oldest
physical
traces
of
mankind
but
we
may
go
further
and
demonstrate
by
evidence
of
the
same
authority
as
that
which
testifies
to
the
existence
of
the
father
of
men
that
the
chalk
is
vastly
older
than
adam
himself
the
book
of
genesis
informs
us
that
adam
immediately
upon
his
creation
and
before
the
appearance
of
eve
was
placed
in
the
garden
of
eden
the
problem
of
the
geographical
position
of
eden
has
greatly
vexed
the
spirits
of
the
learned
in
such
matters
but
there
is
one
point
respecting
which
so
far
as
i
know
no
commentator
has
ever
raised
a
doubt
this
is
that
of
the
four
rivers
which
are
said
to
run
out
of
it
euphrates
and
hiddekel
are
identical
with
the
rivers
now
known
by
the
names
of
euphrates
and
tigris
but
the
whole
country
in
which
these
mighty
rivers
take
their
origin
and
through
which
they
run
is
composed
of
rocks
which
are
either
of
the
same
age
as
the
chalk
or
of
later
date
so
that
the
chalk
must
not
only
have
been
formed
but
after
its
formation
the
time
required
for
the
deposit
of
these
later
rocks
and
for
their
upheaval
into
dry
land
must
have
elapsed
before
the
smallest
brook
which
feeds
the
swift
stream
of
the
great
river
the
river
of
babylon
began
to
flow
thus
evidence
which
can
not
be
rebutted
and
which
need
not
be
strengthened
though
if
time
permitted
i
might
indefinitely
increase
its
quantity
compels
you
to
believe
that
the
earth
from
the
time
of
the
chalk
to
the
present
day
has
been
the
theatre
of
a
series
of
changes
as
vast
in
their
amount
as
they
were
slow
in
their
progress
the
area
on
which
we
stand
has
been
first
sea
and
then
land
for
at
least
four
alternations
and
has
remained
in
each
of
these
conditions
for
a
period
of
great
length
nor
have
these
wonderful
metamorphoses
of
sea
into
land
and
of
land
into
sea
been
confined
to
one
corner
of
england
during
the
chalk
period
or
cretaceous
epoch
not
one
of
the
present
great
physical
features
of
the
globe
was
in
existence
our
great
mountain
ranges
pyrenees
alps
himalayas
andes
have
all
been
upheaved
since
the
chalk
was
deposited
and
the
cretaceous
sea
flowed
over
the
sites
of
sinai
and
ararat
all
this
is
certain
because
rocks
of
cretaceous
or
still
later
date
have
shared
in
the
elevatory
movements
which
gave
rise
to
these
mountain
chains
and
may
be
found
perched
up
in
some
cases
many
thousand
feet
high
upon
their
flanks
and
evidence
of
equal
cogency
demonstrates
that
though
in
norfolk
the
rests
directly
upon
the
chalk
yet
it
does
so
not
because
the
period
at
which
the
forest
grew
immediately
followed
that
at
which
the
chalk
was
formed
but
because
an
immense
lapse
of
time
represented
elsewhere
by
thousands
of
feet
of
rock
is
not
indicated
at
cromer
i
must
ask
you
to
believe
that
there
is
no
less
conclusive
proof
that
a
still
more
prolonged
succession
of
similar
changes
occurred
before
the
chalk
was
deposited
nor
have
we
any
reason
to
think
that
the
first
term
in
the
series
of
these
changes
is
known
the
oldest
preserved
to
us
are
sands
and
mud
and
pebbles
the
wear
and
tear
of
rocks
which
were
formed
in
still
older
oceans
but
great
as
is
the
magnitude
of
these
physical
changes
of
the
world
they
have
been
accompanied
by
a
no
less
striking
series
of
modifications
in
its
living
inhabitants
all
the
great
classes
of
animals
beasts
of
the
field
fowls
of
the
air
creeping
things
and
things
which
dwell
in
the
waters
flourished
upon
the
globe
long
ages
before
the
chalk
was
deposited
very
few
however
if
any
of
these
ancient
forms
of
animal
life
were
identical
with
those
which
now
live
certainly
not
one
of
the
higher
animals
was
of
the
same
species
as
any
of
those
now
in
existence
the
beasts
of
the
field
in
the
days
before
the
chalk
were
not
our
beasts
of
the
field
nor
the
fowls
of
the
air
such
as
those
which
the
eye
of
men
has
seen
flying
unless
his
antiquity
dates
infinitely
further
back
than
we
at
present
surmise
if
we
could
be
carried
back
into
those
times
we
should
be
as
one
suddenly
set
down
in
australia
before
it
was
colonized
we
should
see
mammals
birds
reptiles
fishes
insects
snails
and
the
like
clearly
recognizable
as
such
and
yet
not
one
of
them
would
be
just
the
same
as
those
with
which
we
are
familiar
and
many
would
be
extremely
different
from
that
time
to
the
present
the
population
of
the
world
has
undergone
slow
and
gradual
but
incessant
changes
there
has
been
no
grand
catastrophe
no
destroyer
has
swept
away
the
forms
of
life
of
one
period
and
replaced
them
by
a
totally
new
creation
but
one
species
has
vanished
and
another
has
taken
its
place
creatures
of
one
type
of
structure
have
diminished
those
of
another
have
increased
as
time
has
passed
on
and
thus
while
the
differences
between
the
living
creatures
of
the
time
before
the
chalk
and
those
of
the
present
day
appear
startling
if
placed
side
by
side
we
are
led
from
one
to
the
other
by
the
most
gradual
progress
if
we
follow
the
course
of
nature
through
the
whole
series
of
those
relics
of
her
operations
which
she
has
left
behind
it
is
by
the
population
of
the
chalk
sea
that
the
ancient
and
the
modern
inhabitants
of
the
world
are
most
completely
connected
the
groups
which
are
dying
out
flourish
side
by
side
with
the
groups
which
are
now
the
dominant
forms
of
life
thus
the
chalk
contains
remains
of
those
strange
flying
and
swimming
reptiles
the
pterodactyl
the
ichthyosaurus
and
the
plesiosaurus
which
are
found
in
no
later
deposits
but
abounded
in
preceding
ages
the
chambered
shells
called
ammonites
and
belemnites
which
are
so
characteristic
of
the
period
preceding
the
cretaceous
in
like
manner
die
with
it
but
amongst
these
fading
remainders
of
a
previous
state
of
things
are
some
very
modern
forms
of
life
looking
like
yankee
pedlars
among
a
tribe
of
red
indians
crocodiles
of
modern
type
appear
bony
fishes
many
of
them
very
similar
to
existing
species
almost
supplant
the
forms
of
fish
which
predominate
in
more
ancient
seas
and
many
kinds
of
living
fish
first
become
known
to
us
in
the
chalk
the
vegetation
acquires
a
modern
aspect
a
few
living
animals
are
not
even
distinguishable
as
species
from
those
which
existed
at
that
remote
epoch
the
of
the
present
day
for
example
is
not
different
specifically
from
that
of
the
chalk
and
the
same
maybe
said
of
many
other
i
think
it
probable
that
critical
and
unprejudiced
examination
will
show
that
more
than
one
species
of
much
higher
animals
have
had
a
similar
longevity
but
the
only
example
which
i
can
at
present
give
confidently
is
the
lampshell
caput
which
lives
in
our
english
seas
and
abounded
as
of
authors
in
the
chalk
the
longest
line
of
human
ancestry
must
hide
its
diminished
head
before
the
pedigree
of
this
insignificant
we
englishmen
are
proud
to
have
an
ancestor
who
was
present
at
the
battle
of
hastings
the
ancestors
of
caput
may
have
been
present
at
a
battle
of
in
that
part
of
the
sea
which
when
the
chalk
was
forming
flowed
over
the
site
of
hastings
while
all
around
has
changed
this
has
peacefully
propagated
its
species
from
generation
to
generation
and
stands
to
this
day
as
a
living
testimony
to
the
continuity
of
the
present
with
the
past
history
of
the
globe
up
to
this
moment
i
have
stated
so
far
as
i
know
nothing
but
authenticated
facts
and
the
immediate
conclusions
which
they
force
upon
the
mind
but
the
mind
is
so
constituted
that
it
does
not
willingly
rest
in
facts
and
immediate
causes
but
seeks
always
after
a
knowledge
of
the
remoter
links
in
the
chain
of
causation
taking
the
many
changes
of
any
given
spot
of
the
earth
surface
from
sea
to
land
and
from
land
to
sea
as
an
established
fact
we
can
not
refrain
from
asking
ourselves
how
these
changes
have
occurred
and
when
we
have
explained
them
as
they
must
be
explained
by
the
alternate
slow
movements
of
elevation
and
depression
which
have
affected
the
crust
of
the
earth
we
go
still
further
back
and
ask
why
these
movements
i
am
not
certain
that
any
one
can
give
you
a
satisfactory
answer
to
that
question
assuredly
i
can
not
all
that
can
be
said
for
certain
is
that
such
movements
are
part
of
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
inasmuch
as
they
are
going
on
at
the
present
time
direct
proof
may
be
given
that
some
parts
of
the
land
of
the
northern
hemisphere
are
at
this
moment
insensibly
rising
and
others
insensibly
sinking
and
there
is
indirect
but
perfectly
satisfactory
proof
that
an
enormous
area
now
covered
by
the
pacific
has
been
deepened
thousands
of
feet
since
the
present
inhabitants
of
that
sea
came
into
existence
thus
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
a
reason
for
believing
that
the
physical
changes
of
the
globe
in
past
times
have
been
effected
by
other
than
natural
causes
is
there
any
more
reason
for
believing
that
the
concomitant
modifications
in
the
forms
of
the
living
inhabitants
of
the
globe
have
been
brought
about
in
other
ways
before
attempting
to
answer
this
question
let
us
try
to
form
a
distinct
mental
picture
of
what
has
happened
in
some
special
case
the
crocodiles
are
animals
which
as
a
group
have
a
very
vast
antiquity
they
abounded
ages
before
the
chalk
was
deposited
they
throng
the
rivers
in
warm
climates
at
the
present
day
there
is
a
difference
in
the
form
of
the
joints
of
the
and
in
some
minor
particulars
between
the
crocodiles
of
the
present
epoch
and
those
which
lived
before
the
chalk
but
in
the
cretaceous
epoch
as
i
have
already
mentioned
the
crocodiles
had
assumed
the
modern
type
of
structure
notwithstanding
this
the
crocodiles
of
the
chalk
are
not
identically
the
same
as
those
which
lived
in
the
times
called
older
tertiary
which
succeeded
the
cretaceous
epoch
and
the
crocodiles
of
the
older
tertiaries
are
not
identical
with
those
of
the
newer
tertiaries
nor
are
these
identical
with
existing
forms
i
leave
open
the
question
whether
particular
species
may
have
lived
on
from
epoch
to
epoch
but
each
epoch
has
had
its
peculiar
crocodiles
though
all
since
the
chalk
have
belonged
to
the
modern
type
and
differ
simply
in
their
proportions
and
in
such
structural
particulars
as
are
discernible
only
to
trained
eyes
how
is
the
existence
of
this
long
succession
of
different
species
of
crocodiles
to
be
accounted
for
only
two
suppositions
seem
to
be
open
to
us
either
each
species
of
crocodile
has
been
specially
created
or
it
has
arisen
out
of
some
form
by
the
operation
of
natural
causes
choose
your
hypothesis
i
have
chosen
mine
i
can
find
no
warranty
for
believing
in
the
distinct
creation
of
a
score
of
successive
species
of
crocodiles
in
the
course
of
countless
ages
of
time
science
gives
no
countenance
to
such
a
wild
fancy
nor
can
even
the
perverse
ingenuity
of
a
commentator
pretend
to
discover
this
sense
in
the
simple
words
in
which
the
writer
of
genesis
records
the
proceedings
of
the
fifth
and
six
days
of
the
creation
on
the
other
hand
i
see
no
good
reason
for
doubting
the
necessary
alternative
that
all
these
varied
species
have
been
evolved
from
existing
crocodilian
forms
by
the
operation
of
causes
as
completely
a
part
of
the
common
order
of
nature
as
those
which
have
effected
the
changes
of
the
inorganic
world
few
will
venture
to
affirm
that
the
reasoning
which
applies
to
crocodiles
loses
its
force
among
other
animals
or
among
plants
if
one
series
of
species
has
come
into
existence
by
the
operation
of
natural
causes
it
seems
folly
to
deny
that
all
may
have
arisen
in
the
same
way
a
small
beginning
has
led
us
to
a
great
ending
if
i
were
to
put
the
bit
of
chalk
with
which
we
started
into
the
hot
but
obscure
flame
of
burning
hydrogen
it
would
presently
shine
like
the
sun
it
seems
to
me
that
this
physical
metamorphosis
is
no
false
image
of
what
has
been
the
result
of
our
subjecting
it
to
a
jet
of
fervent
though
nowise
brilliant
thought
it
has
become
luminous
and
its
clear
rays
penetrating
the
abyss
of
the
remote
past
have
brought
within
our
ken
some
stages
of
the
evolution
of
the
earth
and
in
the
shifting
without
haste
but
without
rest
of
the
land
and
sea
as
in
the
endless
variation
of
the
forms
assumed
by
living
beings
we
have
observed
nothing
but
the
natural
product
of
the
forces
originally
possessed
by
the
substance
of
the
universe
ii
the
problems
of
the
deep
sea
on
the
of
december
an
eighteen
gun
corvette
of
tons
burden
sailed
from
portsmouth
harbour
for
a
three
or
perhaps
four
years
cruise
no
ever
left
that
famous
port

with
so
singular
an
equipment

of
the
eighteen
pounders
of

enable
her
to
speak
with

haply
devoid
of
any
respect

she
is

could

has
been

it

seem
as

nothing

of

most
improbable
contingencies
could
prevent
the
from
doing
splendid
work
and
opening
up
a
new
era
in
the
history
of
scientific
voyages
the
dispatch
of
this
expedition
is
the
culmination
of
a
series
of
such
enterprises
gradually
increasing
in
magnitude
and
importance
which
the
admiralty
greatly
to
its
credit
has
carried
out
for
some
years
past
and
the
history
of
which
is
given
by
wyville
thomson
in
the
beautifully
illustrated
volume
entitled
the
depths
of
the
sea
published
since
his
departure
in
the
spring
of
the
year
my
friend
carpenter
at
that
time
one
of
the
of
the
royal
society
was
with
me
in
ireland
where
we
were
working
out
together
the
structure
and
development
of
the
crinoids
i
had
long
previously
had
a
profound
conviction
that
the
land
of
promise
for
the
naturalist
the
only
remaining
region
where
there
were
endless
novelties
of
extraordinary
interest
ready
to
the
hand
which
had
the
means
of
gathering
them
was
the
bottom
of
the
deep
sea
i
had
even
had
a
glimpse
of
some
of
these
treasures
for
i
had
seen
the
year
before
with
sars
the

which
i
have
already
mentioned
dredged
by
his

at

islands
i
propounded
my
views
to
my
and
we
discussed
the
subject
many
times
over
our
microscopes
i
strongly
urged
carpenter
to
use
his
influence
at
to
induce
the
admiralty
probably
through
the
council
of
the
royal
society
to
give
us
the
use
of
a
vessel
properly
fitted
with
dredging
gear
and
all
necessary
scientific
apparatus
that
many
heavy
questions
as
to
the
state
of
things
in
the
depths
of
the
ocean
which
were
still
in
a
state
of
uncertainty
might
be
definitely
settled
after
full
consideration
carpenter
promised
his
hearty
operation
and
we
agreed
that
i
should
write
to
him
on
his
return
to
london
indicating
generally
the
results
which
i
anticipated
and
sketching
out
what
i
conceived
to
be
a
promising
line
of
inquiry
the
council
of
the
royal
society
warmly
supported
the
proposal
and
i
give
here
in
chronological
order
the
short
and
eminently
satisfactory
correspondence
which
led
to
the
admiralty
placing
at
the
disposal
of
carpenter
and
myself
the
gunboat

the
command
of

plain
men
may
be

to

why
wyville
thomson
not
being
a
cynic
should
relegate
the
land
of
promise
to
the
bottom
of
the
deep
sea
they
may
still
more
wonder
what
manner
of

the
expects
to
find

their
perplexity
may
well
rise
to
its
maximum
when
they
seek
to
divine
the
manner
in
which
that
milk
and
honey
are
to
be
got
out
of
so
inaccessible
a
canaan
i
will
therefore
endeavour
to
give
some
answer
to
these
questions
in
an
order
the
reverse
of
that
in
which
i
have
stated
them
apart
from
hooks
and
lines
and
ordinary
nets
fishermen
have
from
time
immemorial
made
use
of
two
kinds
of
implements
for
getting
at
creatures
which
live
beyond
these
are
the
dredge
and
the
trawl
the
dredge
is
used
by
imagine
a
large
bag
the
mouth
of
which
has
the
shape
of
an
elongated
parallelogram
and
is
fastened
to
an
iron
frame
of
the
same
shape
the
two
long
sides
of
this
rim
being
fashioned
into
scrapers
chains
attach
the
ends
of
the
frame
to
a
stout
rope
so
that
when
the
bag
is
dragged
along
by
the
rope
the
edge
of
one
of
the
scrapers
rests
on
the
ground
and
scrapes
whatever
it
touches
into
the
bag
the
takes
one
of
these
machines
in
his
boat
and
when
he
has
reached
the
the
dredge
is
tossed
overboard
as
soon
as
it
has
sunk
to
the
bottom
the
rope
is
paid
out
sufficiently
to
prevent
it
from
pulling
the
dredge
directly
upwards
and
is
then
made
fast
while
the
boat
goes
ahead
the
dredge
is
thus
dragged
along
and
scrapes
oysters
and
other
and
plants
stones
and
mud
into
the
bag
when
the
dredger
judges
it
to
be
full
he
hauls
it
up
picks
out
the
oysters
throws
the
rest
overboard
and
begins
again
dredging
in
shallow
water
say
ten
to
twenty
fathoms
is
an
easy
operation
enough
but
the
deeper
the
dredger
goes
the
heavier
must
be
his
vessel
and
the
stouter
his
tackle
while
the
operation
of
hauling
up
becomes
more
and
more
laborious
dredging
in
fathoms
is
very
hard
work
if
it
has
to
be
carried
on
by
manual
labour
but
by
the
use
of
the
to
supply
power
and
of
the
contrivances
known
as
accumulators
to
diminish
the
risk
of
snapping
the
dredge
rope
by
the
rolling
and
pitching
of
the
vessel
the
dredge
has
been
worked
deeper
and
deeper
until
at
last
on
the
of
july
being
in
the
bay
of
biscay
captain
calver
her
commander
performed
the
unprecedented
feat
of
dredging
in
fathoms
or
feet
a
depth
nearly
equal
to
the
height
of
mont
blanc
the
dredge
was
rapidly
hauled
on
deck
at
one
in
the
morning
of
the
after
an
absence
of
hours
and
a
journey
of
upwards
of
eight
statute
miles
with
a
hundred
weight
and
a
half
of
solid
contents
footnote
the
emotional
side
of
the
scientific
nature
has
its
singularities
many
persons
will
call
to
mind
a
certain
tenderness
over
his
watch
the
little
creature
which
was
so
singularly
lost
and
found
again
but
wyville
thomson
surpasses
the
owner
of
the
watch
in
his
towards
a
this
little
engine
was
the
comfort
of
our
lives
once
or
twice
it
was
overstrained
and
then
we
pitied
the
willing
little
thing
panting
like
an
overtaxed
horse
the
trawl
is
a
sort
of
net
for
catching
those
fish
which
habitually
live
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
such
as
soles
plaice
turbot
and
gurnett
the
mouth
of
the
net
may
be
thirty
or
forty
feet
wide
and
one
edge
of
its
mouth
is
fastened
to
a
beam
of
wood
of
the
same
length
the
two
ends
of
the
beam
are
supported
by
curved
pieces
of
iron
which
raise
the
beam
and
the
edge
of
the
net
which
is
fastened
to
it
for
a
short
distance
while
the
other
edge
of
the
mouth
of
the
net
trails
upon
the
ground
the
closed
end
of
the
net
has
the
form
of
a
great
pouch
and
as
the
beam
is
dragged
along
the
fish
roused
from
the
bottom
by
the
sweeping
of
the
net
readily
pass
into
its
mouth
and
accumulate
in
the
pouch
at
its
end
after
drifting
with
the
tide
for
six
or
seven
hours
the
trawl
is
hauled
up
the
marketable
fish
are
picked
out
the
others
thrown
away
and
the
trawl
sent
overboard
for
another
operation
more
than
a
thousand
sail
of
trawlers
are
constantly
engaged
in
sweeping
the
seas
around
our
coast
in
this
way
and
it
is
to
them
that
we
owe
a
very
large
proportion
of
our
supply
of
fish
the
difficulty
of
trawling
like
that
of
dredging
rapidly
increases
with
the
depth
at
which
the
operation
is
performed
and
until
the
other
day
it
is
probable
that
trawling
at
so
great
a
depth
as
fathoms
was
something
unheard
of
but
the
first
news
from
the
opens
up
new
possibilities
for
the
trawl
wyville
thomson
writes
nature
march
for
the
first
two
or
three
hauls
in
very
deep
water
off
the
coast
of
portugal
the
dredge
came
up
filled
with
the
usual
ooze
tenacious
and
uniform
throughout
and
the
work
of
hours
in
sifting
gave
the
very
smallest
possible
result
we
were
extremely
anxious
to
get
some
idea
of
the
general
character
of
the
fauna
and
particularly
of
the
distribution
of
the
higher
groups
and
after
various
suggestions
for
modification
of
the
dredge
it
was
proposed
to
try
the
ordinary
trawl
we
had
a
compact
trawl
with
a
beam
on
board
and
we
sent
it
down
off
cape
vincent
at
a
depth
of
fathoms
the
experiment
looked
hazardous
but
to
our
great
satisfaction
the
trawl
came
up
all
right
and
contained
with
many
of
the
larger
invertebrate
several
fishes
after
the
first
attempt
we
tried
the
trawl
several
times
at
depths
of
and
finally
fathoms
and
always
with
success
to
the
of
the
mediterranean
who
seek
the
precious
red
coral
which
grows
firmly
fixed
to
rocks
at
a
depth
of
sixty
to
eighty
fathoms
both
the
dredge
and
the
trawl
would
be
useless
they
therefore
have
recourse
to
a
sort
of
frame
to
which
are
fastened
long
bundles
of
loosely
netted
hempen
cord
and
which
is
lowered
by
a
rope
to
the
depth
at
which
the
hempen
cords
can
sweep
over
the
surface
of
the
rocks
and
break
off
the
coral
which
is
brought
up
entangled
in
the
cords
a
similar
contrivance
has
arisen
out
of
the
necessities
of
exploration
in
the
course
of
the
dredging
of
the
it
was
frequently
found
that
while
few
objects
of
interest
were
brought
up
within
the
dredge
many
living
creatures
came
up
sticking
to
the
outside
of
the
and
even
to
the
first
few
fathoms
of
the
the
mouth
of
the
dredge
doubtless
rapidly
filled
with
mud
and
thus
the
things
it
should
have
brought
up
were
shut
out
to
remedy
this
inconvenience
captain
calver
devised
an
arrangement
not
unlike
that
employed
by
the
fishers
he
fastened
half
a
dozen
swabs
such
as
are
used
for
drying
decks
to
the
dredge
a
swab
is
something
like
what
a
would
be
if
its
twigs
were
made
of
long
coarse
hempen
yarns
these
dragged
along
after
the
dredge
over
the
surface
of
the
mud
and
entangled
the
creatures
living
there
multitudes
of
which
twisted
up
in
the
strands
of
the
swabs
were
brought
to
the
surface
with
the
dredge
a
further
improvement
was
made
by
attaching
a
long
iron
bar
to
the
bottom
of
the
dredge
bag
and
fastening
large
bunches
of
hemp
to
the
end
of
this
bar
these
tangles
bring
up
immense
quantities
of
such
animals
as
have
long
arms
or
spines
or
prominences
which
readily
become
caught
in
the
hemp
but
they
are
very
destructive
to
the
fragile
organisms
which
they
imprison
and
now
that
the
trawl
can
be
successfully
worked
at
the
greatest
depths
it
may
be
expected
to
supersede
them
at
least
wherever
the
ground
is
soft
enough
to
permit
of
trawling
it
is
obvious
that
between
the
dredge
the
trawl
and
the
tangles
there
is
little
chance
for
any
organism
except
such
as
are
able
to
burrow
rapidly
to
remain
safely
at
the
bottom
of
any
part
of
the
sea
which
the
undertakes
to
explore
and
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
scientific
exploration
we
have
a
fair
chance
of
learning
what
the
population
of
the
depths
of
the
sea
is
like
in
the
most
widely
different
parts
of
the
world
and
now
arises
the
next
question
the
means
of
exploration
being
fairly
adequate
what
forms
of
life
may
be
looked
for
at
these
vast
depths
the
systematic
study
of
the
distribution
of
living
beings
is
the
most
modern
branch
of
biological
science
and
came
into
existence
long
after
morphology
and
physiology
had
attained
a
considerable
development
this
naturally
does
not
imply
that
from
the
time
men
began
to
observe
natural
phenomena
they
were
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
the
animals
and
plants
of
one
part
of
the
world
are
different
from
those
in
other
regions
or
that
those
of
the
hills
are
different
from
those
of
the
plains
in
the
same
region
or
finally
that
some
marine
creatures
are
found
only
in
the
shallows
while
others
inhabit
the
deeps
nevertheless
it
was
only
after
the
discovery
of
america
that
the
attention
of
naturalists
was
powerfully
drawn
to
the
wonderful
differences
between
the
animal
population
of
the
central
and
southern
parts
of
the
new
world
and
that
of
those
parts
of
the
old
world
which
lie
under
the
same
parallels
of
latitude
so
far
back
as
abraham
mylius
in
his
treatise
de
animalium
origine
et
migratione
populorum
argues
that
since
there
are
innumerable
species
of
animals
in
america
which
do
not
exist
elsewhere
they
must
have
been
made
and
placed
there
by
the
deity
buffon
no
less
forcibly
insists
upon
the
difference
between
the
faunae
of
the
old
and
new
world
but
the
first
attempt
to
gather
facts
of
this
order
into
a
whole
and
to
coordinate
them
into
a
series
of
generalizations
or
laws
of
geographical
distribution
is
not
a
century
old
and
is
contained
in
the
specimen
zoologiae
geographicae
quadrupedum
domicilia
et
migrationes
sistens
published
in
by
the
learned
brunswick
professor
eberhard
zimmermann
who
illustrates
his
work
by
what
he
calls
a
tabula
zoographica
which
is
the
oldest
distributional
map
known
to
me
in
regard
to
matters
of
fact
zimmermann
chief
aim
is
to
show
that
among
terrestrial
mammals
some
occur
all
over
the
world
while
others
are
restricted
to
particular
areas
of
greater
or
smaller
extent
and
that
the
abundance
of
species
follows
temperature
being
greatest
in
warm
and
least
in
cold
climates
but
marine
animals
he
thinks
obey
no
such
law
the
arctic
and
atlantic
seas
he
says
are
as
full
of
fishes
and
other
animals
as
those
of
the
tropics
it
is
therefore
clear
that
cold
does
not
affect
the
dwellers
in
the
sea
as
it
does
land
animals
and
that
this
must
be
the
case
follows
from
the
fact
that
sea
water
propter
varias
quas
continet
bituminis
spiritusque
particulas
freezes
with
much
more
difficulty
than
fresh
water
on
the
other
hand
the
heat
of
the
equatorial
sun
penetrates
but
a
short
distance
below
the
surface
of
the
ocean
moreover
according
to
zimmermann
the
incessant
disturbance
of
the
mass
of
the
sea
by
winds
and
tides
so
mixes
up
the
warm
and
the
cold
that
life
is
evenly
diffused
and
abundant
throughout
the
ocean
in
risso
in
his
work
on
the
ichthyology
of
nice
laid
the
foundation
of
what
has
since
been
termed
bathymetrical
distribution
or
distribution
in
depth

showing
that
regions
of
the

of
different

could
be
distinguished

inhabit

on
the
normandy

about
malo
where
their
observations
were
made
into
four
zones
each
characterized
by
its
peculiar
invertebrate
inhabitants
beyond
the
fourth

they
distinguish
a
fifth
which
is
never
uncovered
and
is
inhabited
by
oysters
scallops
and
large
starfishes
and
other
animals
beyond
this
they

to
think
that

on

hand
the

this

and
the

region
from

in
the
deeper
waters
of
the
aegean
sea
between
the
shore
and
a
depth
of
fathoms
forbes
was
able
to
make
out
no
fewer
than
eight
zones
of
life
in
the
course
of
which
the
number
and
variety
of
forms
gradually
diminished
until
beyond
fathoms
life
disappeared
altogether
hence
it
appeared
as
if
descent
in
the
sea
had
much
the
same
effect
on
life
as
ascent
on
land
recent
investigations
appear
to
show
that
forbes
was
right
enough
in
his
classification
of
the
facts
of
distribution
in
depth
as
they
are
to
be
observed
in
the
aegean
and
though
at
the
time
he
wrote
one
or
two
observations
were
extant
which
might
have
warned
him
not
to
generalize
too
extensively
from
his
aegean
experience
his
own
dredging
work
was
so
much
more
extensive
and
systematic
than
that
of
any
other
naturalist
that
it
is
not
wonderful
he
should
have
felt
justified
in
building
upon
it
nevertheless
so
far
as
the
limit
of
the
range
of
life
in
depth
goes
forbes
conclusion
has
been
completely
negatived
and
the
greatest
depths
yet
attained
show
not
even
an
approach
to
a
zero
of
life
during
the
several
cruises
of
ships
and
in
the
years
and
says
wyville
thomson
hauls
of
the
dredge
were
taken
in
the
atlantic
at
depths
beyond
fathoms
and
sixteen
at
depths
beyond
fathoms
and
in
all
cases
life
was
abundant
in
we
took
two
casts
in
depths
greater
than
fathoms
in
both
of
these
life
was
abundant
and
with
the
deepest
cast
fathoms
off
the
month
of
the
bay
of
biscay
we
took
living
and
characteristic
examples
of
all
the
five
invertebrate
kingdoms
and
thus
the
question
of
the
existence
of
abundant
animal
life
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
has
been
finally
settled
and
for
all
depths
for
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
depth
anywhere
exceeds
between
three
and
four
thousand
fathoms
and
if
there
be
nothing
in
the
conditions
of
a
depth
of
fathoms
to
prevent
the
full
development
of
a
varied
fauna
it
is
impossible
to
suppose
that
even
an
additional

would

essay
on

between
the

of

and

of
the
british
isles
and
the
geological
changes
which
have
affected
their
area
especially
during
the
epoch
of
the
northern
drift
to
which
reference
has
already
been
made
he
put
forth
a
most
pregnant
suggestion
in
certain
parts
of
the
sea
bottom
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
british
islands
as
in
the
clyde
district
among
the
hebrides
in
the
moray
firth
and
in
the
german
ocean
there
are
depressed
areas
forming
a
kind
of
submarine
valleys
the
centres
of
which
are
from
to
fathoms
or
more
deep
these
depressions
are
inhabited
by
assemblages
of
marine
animals
which
differ
from
those
found
over
the
adjacent
and
shallower
region
and
resemble
those
which
are
met
with
much
farther
north
on
the
norwegian
coast
forbes
called
these
scandinavian
detachments
northern
outliers
how
did
these
isolated
patches
of
a
northern
population
get
into
these
deep
places
to
explain
the
mystery
forbes
called
to
mind
the
fact
that
in
the
epoch
which
immediately
preceded
the
present
the
climate
was
much
colder
whence
the
name
of
glacial
epoch
applied
to
it
and
that
the
shells
which
are
found
fossil
or
in
deposits
of
that
age
are
precisely
such
as
are
now
to
be
met
with
only
in
the
scandinavian
or
still
more
arctic
regions
undoubtedly
during
the
glacial
epoch
the
general
population
of
our
seas
had
universally
the
northern
aspect
which
is
now
presented
only
by
the
northern
outliers
just
as
the
vegetation
of
the
land
down
to
the
had
the
northern
character
which
is
at
present
exhibited
only
by
the
plants
which
live
on
the
tops
of
our
mountains
but
as
the
glacial
epoch
passed
away
and
the
present
climatal
conditions
were
developed
the
northern
plants
were
able
to
maintain
themselves
only
on
the
bleak
heights
on
which
southern
forms
could
not
compete
with
them
and
in
like
manner
forbes
suggested
that
after
the
glacial
epoch
the
northern
animals
then
inhabiting
the
sea
became
restricted
to
the
deeps
in
which
they
could
hold
their
own
against
invaders
from
the
south
better
fitted
than
they
to
flourish
in
the
warmer
waters
of
the
shallows
thus
depth
in
the
sea
corresponded
in
its
effect
upon
distribution
to
height
on
the
land
the
same
idea
is
applied
to
the
explanation
of
a
similar
anomaly
in
the
fauna
of
the
aegean
in
the
deepest
of
the
regions
of
depth
of
the
aegean
the
representation
of
a
northern
fauna
is
maintained
partly
by
identical
and
partly
by
representative
forms
the
presence
of
the
latter
is
essentially
due
to
the
law
of
representation
of
parallels
of
latitude
by
zones
of
depth
whilst
that
of
the
former
species
depended
on
their
transmission
from
their
parent
seas
during
a
former
epoch
and
subsequent
isolation
that
epoch
was
doubtless
the
newer
pliocene
or
glacial
era
when
the
and
other
northern
forms
now
extinct
in
the
mediterranean
and
found
fossil
in
the
sicilian
tertiaries
ranged
into
that
sea
the
changes
which
there
destroyed
the
glacial
forms
did
not
affect
those
living
in
the
depths
and
which
still
survive

in

at

time
and
the
desirableness
of
solving

put
in

among

was
one
of
surpassing
interest
the

you
have
a

and
which
we
at
once
recognised
as
a
degraded
type
of
the
an

hitherto
regarded
as
extinct

attained
its
maximum
in

observations
place
it
beyond
a
doubt
that
animal
life
is
abundant
in
the
ocean
at
depths
varying
from
to
fathoms
that
the
forms
at
these
great
depths
differ
greatly
from
those
met
with

that
at

are
closely
allied
to

would
seem
to
be
directly
descended
from
the

early
tertiaries

think
the
latter
result
might
almost
have
been
anticipated
and
probably
further
investigation
will
largely
add
to
this
class
of
data

will
give
us
an
opportunity

testing
our
determinations

the
zoological
position

some
fossil
types

an
examination

the
main
cause
of
the
destruction

the
extreme
modification
of
animal
types
appear
to
be
change
of

depending

at

no

that

biology
in

long
run
rests
upon
physics
and
the
first
condition
for
arriving
at
a
sound
theory
of
distribution
in
the
deep

is
the
precise
ascertainment
of
the
conditions

in

words
a
full
knowledge
of
all
those
phenomena
which
are
embraced
under
the
head
of
the
physical
geography
of
the
ocean
excellent
work
has
already
been
done
in
this
direction
chiefly
under
the
superintendence
of
carpenter
by
the

some
data

as

down
to
its

point
instead
of
expanding

reaches
its

as

does
the
truth
has
been
steadily
ignored
by
even
the

authorities
in

the
erroneous
conclusions
deduced

have
been

of
the
first
results

the
careful
ascertainment
of
the
temperature
at
different
depths
by
means
of
thermometers
specially
contrived
for
the
avoidance
of
the
errors
produced
by

was
the
proof
that
below
fathoms
in
the
atlantic
down
to
the
greatest
depths
yet
sounded
the
water
has
a
temperature
always
lower
than
whatever
be
the
temperature
of
the
water
at
the
surface
and
that
this
low
temperature
of
the
deepest
water
is
probably
the
universal
rule
for
the
depths
of
the
open
ocean
is
shown
among
others
by
captain
chimmo
recent
observations
in
the
indian
ocean
between
ceylon
and
sumatra
where
the
surface
water
ranging
from
the
temperature
at
the
bottom
at
a
depth
of
to
fathoms
was
only
from
to
fahr
as
the
mean
temperature
of
the
superficial
layer
of
the
crust
of
the
earth
may
be
taken
at
about
it
follows
that
the
bottom
layer
of
the
deep
sea
in
temperate
and
hot
latitudes
is
on
the
average
much
colder
than
either
of
the
bodies
with
which
it
is
in
contact
for
the
temperature
of
the
earth
is
constant
while
that
of
the
air
rarely
falls
so
low
as
that
of
the
bottom
water
in
the
latitudes
in
question
and
even
when
it
does
has
time
to
affect
only
a
comparatively
thin
stratum
of
the
surface
water
before
the
return
of
warm
weather
how
does
this
apparently
anomalous
state
of
things
come
about
if
we
suppose
the
globe
to
be
covered
with
a
universal
ocean
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
the
cold
of
the
regions
towards
the
poles
must
tend
to
cause
the
superficial
water
of
those
regions
to
contract
and
become
specifically
heavier
under
these
circumstances
it
would
have
no
alternative
but
to
descend
and
spread
over
the
sea
bottom
while
its
place
would
be
taken
by
warmer
water
drawn
from
the
adjacent
regions
thus
deep
cold
currents
and
superficial
warmer
currents
would
be
set
up
and
as
the
former
would
have
a
less
velocity
of
rotation
from
west
to
east
than
the
regions
towards
which
they
travel
they
would
not
be
due
southerly
or
northerly
currents
but
in
the
northern
hemisphere
and
in
the
southern
while
by
a
parity
of
reasoning
the
warm
currents
would
be
in
the
northern
hemisphere
and
easterly
in
the
southern
hence
as
a
current
has
the
same
direction
as
a
wind
the
direction
of
the
northern
current
in
the
part
of
its
course
would
pretty
nearly
coincide
with
that
of
the
winds
the
freezing
of
the
surface
of
the
polar
sea
would
not
interfere
with
the
movement
thus
set
up
for
however
bad
a
conductor
of
heat
ice
may
be
the
unfrozen
immediately
in
contact
with
the
undersurface
of
the
ice
must
needs
be
colder
than
that
further
off
and
hence
will
constantly
tend
to
descend
through
the
subjacent
warmer
water
in
this
way
it
would
seem
inevitable
that
the
surface
waters
of
the
northern
and
southern
frigid
zones
must
sooner
or
later
find
their
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
rest
of
the
ocean
and
there
accumulate
to
a
thickness
dependent
on
the
rate
at
which
they
absorb
heat
from
the
crust
of
the
earth
below
and
from
the
surface
water
above
if
this
hypothesis
be
correct
it
follows
that
if
any
part
of
the
ocean
in
warm
latitudes
is
shut
off
from
the
influence
of
the
cold
polar
underflow
the
temperature
of
its
deeps
should
be
less
cold
than
the
temperature
of
corresponding
depths
in
the
open
sea
now
in
the
mediterranean
nature
offers
a
remarkable
experimental
proof
of
just
the
kind
needed
it
is
a
landlocked
sea
which
runs
nearly
east
and
west
between
the
and
parallels
of
north
latitude
roughly
speaking
the
average
temperature
of
the
air
over
it
is
fahr
in
july
and
in
january
this
great
expanse
of
water
is
divided
by
the
peninsula
of
italy
including
sicily
continuous
with
which
is
a
submarine
elevation
carrying
less
than
feet
of
water
which
extends
from
sicily
to
cape
bon
in
africa
into
two
great
pools
an
eastern
and
a
western
the
eastern
pool
rapidly
deepens
to
more
than
feet
and
sends
off
to
the
north
its
comparatively
shallow
branches
the
adriatic
and
the
aegean
seas
the
western
pool
is
less
deep
though
it
reaches
some
feet
and
just
as
the
western
end
of
the
eastern
pool
communicates
by
a
shallow
passage
not
a
sixth
of
its
greatest
depth
with
the
western
pool
so
the
western
pool
is
separated
from
the
atlantic
by
a
ridge
which
runs
between
capes
trafalgar
and
spartel
on
which
there
is
hardly
feet
of
water
all
the
water
of
the
mediterranean
which
lies
deeper
than
about
fathoms
therefore
is
shut
off
from
that
of
the
atlantic
and
there
is
no
communication
between
the
cold
layer
of
the
atlantic
below
fathoms
and
the
mediterranean
under
these
circumstances
what
is
the
temperature
of
the
mediterranean
everywhere
below
feet
it
is
about
fahr
and
consequently
at
its
greatest
depths
it
is
some
warmer
than
the
corresponding
depths
of
the
atlantic
it
seems
extremely
difficult
to
account
for
this
difference
in
any
other
way
than
by
adopting
the
views
so
strongly
and
ably
advocated
by
carpenter
that
in
the
existing
distribution
of
land
and
water
such
a
circulation
of
the
water
of
the
ocean
does
actually
occur
as
theoretically
must
occur
in
the
universal
ocean
with
which
we
started
it
is
quite
another
question
however
whether
this
theoretic
circulation
true
cause
as
it
may
be
is
competent
to
give
rise
to
such
movements
of
in
mass
as
those
currents
which
have
commonly
been
regarded
as
northern
extensions
of
the
i
shall
not
venture
to
touch
upon
this
complicated
problem
but
i
may
take
occasion
to
remark
that
the
cause
of
a
much
simpler
phenomenon
the
stream
of
atlantic
water
which
sets
through
the
straits
of
gibraltar
eastward
at
the
rate
of
two
or
three
miles
an
hour
or
more
does
not
seem
to
be
so
clearly
made
out
as
is
desirable
the
facts
appear
to
be
that
the
water
of
the
mediterranean
is
very
slightly
denser
than
that
of
the
atlantic
to
and
that
the
deep
water
of
the
mediterranean
is
slightly
denser
than
that
of
the
surface
while
the
deep
water
of
the
atlantic
is
if
anything
lighter
than
that
of
the
surface
moreover
while
a
rapid
superficial
current
is
setting
in
always
save
in
exceptionally
violent
easterly
winds
through
the
straits
of
gibraltar
from
the
atlantic
to
the
mediterranean
a
deep
undercurrent
together
with
variable
side
currents
is
setting
out
through
the
straits
from
the
mediterranean
to
the
atlantic
carpenter
adopts
without
hesitation
the
view
that
the
cause
of
this
indraught
of
atlantic
water
is
to
be
sought
in
the
much
more
rapid
evaporation
which
takes
place
from
the
surface
of
the
mediterranean
than
from
that
of
the
atlantic
and
thus
by
lowering
the
level
of
the
former
gives
rise
to
an
indraught
from
the
latter
but
is
there
any
sound
foundation
for
the
three
assumptions
involved
here
firstly
that
the
evaporation
from
the
mediterranean
as
a
whole
is
much
greater
than
that
from
the
atlantic
under
corresponding
parallels
secondly
that
the
rainfall
over
the
mediterranean
makes
up
for
evaporation
less
than
it
does
over
the
atlantic
and
thirdly
supposing
these
two
questions
answered
affirmatively
are
not
these
sources
of
loss
in
the
mediterranean
fully
covered
by
the
prodigious
quantity
of
fresh
water
which
is
poured
into
it
by
great
rivers
and
submarine
springs
consider
that
the
water
of
the
ebro
the
rhine
the
po
the
danube
the
don
the
dnieper
and
the
nile
all
flow
directly
or
indirectly
into
the
mediterranean
that
the
volume
of
fresh
water
which
they
pour
into
it
is
so
enormous
that
fresh
water
may
sometimes
be
baled
up
from
the
surface
of
the
sea
off
the
delta
of
the
nile
while
the
land
is
not
yet
in
sight
that
the
water
of
the
black
sea
is
half
fresh
and
that
a
current
of
three
or
four
miles
an
hour
constantly
streams
from
it
mediterraneanwards
through
the
bosphorus
consider
in
addition
that
no
fewer
than
ten
submarine
springs
of
fresh
water
are
known
to
burst
up
in
the
mediterranean
some
of
them
so
large
that
admiral
smyth
calls
them
subterranean
rivers
of
amazing
volume
and
force
and
it
would
seem
on
the
face
of
the
matter
that
the
sun
must
have
enough
to
do
to
keep
the
level
of
the
mediterranean
down
and
that
possibly
we
may
have
to
seek
for
the
cause
of
the
small
superiority
in
saline
contents
of
the
mediterranean
water
in
some
condition
other
than
solar
evaporation
again
if
the
gibraltar
indraught
is
the
effect
of
evaporation
why
does
it
go
on
in
winter
as
well
as
in
summer
all
these
are
questions
more
easily
asked
than
answered
but
they
must
be
answered
before
we
can
accept
the
gibraltar
stream
as
an
example
of
a
current
produced
by
indraught
with
any
comfort
the
mediterranean
is
not
included
in
the
route
but
she
will
visit
one
of
the
most
promising
and
little
explored
of
hydrographical
regions
the
north
pacific
between
polynesia
and
the
asiatic
and
american
shores
and
doubtless
the
store
of
observations
upon
the
currents
of
this
region
which
she
will
accumulate
when
compared
with
what
we
know
of
the
north
atlantic
will
throw
a
powerful
light
upon
the
present
obscurity
of
the
problem
iii

some
of
the
results

the

the
important
problems
connected

the

history

the
solution

which
there
was
every
reason
to
hope
the

furnish
important
contributions

expectation
then
expressed

not
been
disappointed

to
the

communicated

have
made
admirable
use
of
their
great
opportunities
and
that
on
the
return
of
the
expedition
in
their
performance
will
be
fully
up
to
the
level
of
their
promise
indeed
i
am
disposed
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
nothing
more
came
of
the
expedition
than
has
hitherto
been
yielded
by
her
exploration
of
the
nature
of
the
sea
bottom
at
great

a
full

equivalent
of
the
trouble

expense
of
her

would
have
been
obtained

among
the
scientific
instructions
for
the
voyage

up
by
a
committee
of

royal
society
however
there
is
a
remarkable
letter
from
von
humboldt
to
lord
minto
then
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
in
which
among
other
things
he
dwells
upon
the
significance
of
the
researches
into
the
microscopic
composition
of
rocks
and
the
discovery
of
the
great
share
which
microscopic
organisms
take
in
the
formation
of
the
crust
of
the
earth
at
the
present
day
made
by
ehrenberg
in
the
years
ehrenberg
in
fact
had
shown
that
the
extensive
beds
of
or
tripoli
which
occur
in
various
parts
of
the
world
and
notably
at
bilin
in
bohemia
consisted
of
accumulations
of
the
silicious
cases
and
skeletons
of
sponges
and
he
had
proved
that
similar
deposits
were
being
formed
by
in
the
pools
of
the
thiergarten
in
berlin
and
elsewhere
and
had
pointed
out
that
if
it
were
commercially
worth
while
might
be
manufactured
by
a
process
of
observations
conducted
at
cuxhaven
in
had
revealed
the
existence
at
the
surface
of
the
waters
of
the
baltic
of
living
diatoms
and
of
the
same
species
as
those
which
in
a
fossil
state
constitute
extensive
rocks
of
tertiary
age
at
caltanisetta
zante
and
oran
on
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
moreover
in
the
beds
of
bilin
ehrenberg
had
traced
out
the
metamorphosis
effected
apparently
by
the
action
of
percolating
water
of
the
primitively
loose
and
friable
deposit
of
organized
particles
in
which
the
silex
exists
in
the
hydrated
or
soluble
condition
the
silex
in
fact
undergoes
solution
and
slow
redeposition
until
in
ultimate
result
the
excessively
sand
each
particle
of
which
is
a
skeleton
becomes
converted
into
a
dense
opaline
stone
with
only
here
and
there
an
indication
of
an
organism
from
the
consideration
of
these
facts
ehrenberg
as
early
as
the
year
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
rocks
altogether
similar
to
those
which
constitute
a
large
part
of
the
crust
of
the
earth
must
be
forming
at
the
present
day
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
he
threw
out
the
suggestion
that
even
where
no
trace
of
organic
structure
is
to
be
found
in
the
older
rocks
it
may
have
been
lost
by
metamorphosis

inaccessible
that
i
make
no
apology
for
quoting
them
at

the
waters
and
the
ice
of
the
south
polar
ocean
were
alike
found
to
abound
with
microscopic
vegetables
belonging
to
the
order
though
much
too
small
to
be
discernible
by
the
naked
eye
they
occurred
in
such
countless
myriads
as
to
stain
the
berg
and
the
pack
ice
wherever
they
were
washed
by
the
swell
of
the
sea
and
when
enclosed
in
the
congealing
surface
of

they
imparted
to
the
brash
and
pancake
ice
a
pale
ochreous
colour
in
the
open

northward
of
the

this
order
though
no
doubt
almost
universally
present
generally
eludes
the
search
of
the
naturalist
except
when
its
species
are
congregated
amongst
that
mucous
scum
which
is
sometimes
seen
floating
on
the
waves
and
of
whose
real
nature
we
are
ignorant
or
when
the
coloured
contents
of
the
marine
animals
who
feed
on
these
algae
are
examined

the

however
of
the
belt
of

which
encircles
the

between
the
parallels
of

and
in
the

comprised
between
that
belt
and
the
highest
latitude
ever
attained
by
man
this
vegetation
is
very
conspicuous
from
the
contrast
between
its
colour
and
the
white
snow
and
ice
in
which
it
is
imbedded
insomuch
that
in
the
eightieth
degree
all
the
surface
ice
carried
along
by
the
currents
the
sides
of
every
berg
and
the
base
of
the
great
victoria
barrier
itself
within
reach
of
the
swell
were
tinged
brown
as
if
the
polar
waters
were
charged
with
oxide
of
iron
as
the
majority
of
these
plants
consist
of
very
simple
vegetable
cells
enclosed
in
indestructible
silex
as
other
algae
are
in
carbonate
of
lime
it
is
obvious
that
the
death
and
decomposition
of
such
multitudes
must
form
sedimentary
deposits
proportionate
in
their
extent
to
the
length
and
exposure
of
the
coast
against
which
they
are
washed
in
thickness
to
the
power
of
such
agents
as
the
winds
currents

which
sweep
them
more
energetically
to
certain
positions
and
in
purity
to
the
depth
of
the

of

hence
we
detected
their
remains
along

icebound

the
depths
of
the
adjacent

and
fathoms

perpendicular
wall
of

between
one
and
two
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
the

the
bottom
of
the
ocean
was
covered
with
a
stratum
of
pure
white
or
green
mud
composed
principally
of
the
silicious
shells
of
the
these
on
being
put
into
water
rendered
it
cloudy
like
milk
and
took
many
hours
to
subside
in
the
very
deep
water
off
victoria
and
land
this
mud
was
particularly
pure
and
fine
but
towards
the
shallow
shores
there
existed
a
greater
or
less
admixture
of
disintegrated
rock
and
sand
so
that
the
organic
compounds
of
the
bottom
frequently
bore
but
a
small
proportion
to
the
inorganic
the
universal
existence
of
such
an
invisible
vegetation
as
that
of
the
antarctic
ocean
is
a
truly
wonderful
fact
and
the
more
from
its
not
being
accompanied
by
plants
of
a
high
order
during
the
years
we
spent
there
i
had
been
accustomed
to
regard
the
phenomena
of
life
as
differing
totally
from
what
obtains
throughout
all
other
latitudes
for
everything
living
appeared
to
be
of
animal
origin
the
ocean
swarmed
with
and
particularly
entomostracous
small
whales
and
porpoises
the
sea
abounded
with
penguins
and
seals
and
the
air
with
birds
the
animal
kingdom
was
ever
present
the
larger
creatures
preying
on
the
smaller
and
these
again
on
smaller
still
all
seemed
carnivorous
the
herbivorous
were
not
recognised
because
feeding
on
a
microscopic
herbage
of
whose
true
nature
i
had
formed
an
erroneous
impression
it
is
therefore
with
no
little
satisfaction
that
i
now
class
the
with
plants
probably
maintaining
in
the
south
polar
ocean
that
balance
between
the
vegetable
and
the
animal
kingdoms
which
prevails
over
the
surface
of
our
globe
nor
is
the
sustenance
and
nutrition
of
the
animal
kingdom
the
only
function
these
minute
productions
may
perform
they
may
also
be
the
purifiers
of
the
vitiated
atmosphere
and
thus
execute
in
the
antarctic
latitudes
the
office
of
our
trees
and
grass
turf
in
the
temperate
regions
and
the
broad
leaves
of
the
palm
in
the
tropics
with
respect
to
the
distribution
of
the
hooker
remarks
there
is
probably
no
latitude
between
that
of
spitzbergen
and
victoria
land
where
some
of
the
species
of
either
country
do
not
exist
iceland

north
and
south

the
south

islands
all
possess
antarctic
the
silicious
coats
of
species
only
known
living
in
the
waters
of
the
south
polar
ocean
have
during
past
ages
contributed
to
the
formation
of
rocks
and
thus
they
outlive
several
successive
creations
of
organized
beings
the
phonolite
stones
of
the
rhine
and
the
tripoli
stone
contain
species
identical
with
what
are
now
contributing
to
form
a
sedimentary
deposit
and
perhaps
at
some
future
period
a
bed
of
rock
extending
in
one
continuous
stratum
for
measured
miles
i
allude
to
the
shores
of
the
victoria
barrier
along
whose
coast
the
soundings
examined
were
invariably
charged
with
diatomaceous
remains
constituting
a
bank
which
stretches
miles
north
from
the
base
of
victoria
barrier
while
the
average
depth
of
water
above
it
is
fathoms
or
feet
again
some
of
the
antarctic
species
have
been
detected
floating
in
the
atmosphere
which
overhangs
the
wide
ocean
between
africa
and
america
the
knowledge
of
this
marvellous
fact
we
owe
to
darwin
who
when
he
was
at
sea
off
the
cape
de
verd
islands
collected
an
impalpable
powder
which
fell
on
captain
fitzroy
ship
he
transmitted
this
dust
to
ehrenberg
who
ascertained
it
to
consist
of
the
silicious
coats
chiefly
of
american
which
were
being
wafted
through
the
upper
region
of
the
air
when
some
meteorological
phenomena
checked
them
in
their
course
and
deposited
them
on
the
ship
and
surface
of
the
ocean
the
existence
of
the
remains
of
many
species
of
this
order
and
amongst
them
some
antarctic
ones
in
the
volcanic
ashes
pumice
and
scoriae
of
active
and
extinct
volcanoes
those
of
the
mediterranean
sea
and
ascension
island
for
instance
is
a
fact
bearing
immediately
upon
the
present
subject
mount
erebus
a
volcano
feet
high
of
the
first
class
in
dimensions
and
energetic
action
rises
at
once
from
the
ocean
in
the
degree
of
south
latitude
and
abreast
of
the
bank
which
reposes
in
part
on
its
base
hence
it
may
not
appear
preposterous
to
conclude
that
as
vesuvius
receives
the
waters
of
the
mediterranean
with
its
fish
to
eject
them
by
its
crater
so
the
subterranean
and
subaqueous
forces
which
maintain
mount
erebus
in
activity
may
occasionally
receive
organic
matter
from
the
bank
and
disgorge
it
together
with
those
volcanic
products
ashes
and
pumice
along
the
shores
of
graham
land
and
the
south
shetland
islands

have
a

of

similar
nature
with
those
of

and
barrier
and
the
sea
and
ice
as
full
of
this
was
not
only
proved
by
the
deep

lead
but
by
the
examination
of
bergs
which
once
stranded
had
floated
off
and
become
reversed
exposing
an
accumulation
of

and
the

made
by
wyville
thomson
and
his
colleagues
in
every
respect
confirm
those
of

on
the
of
february
lat

and
march

long
the
sounding
instrument
came
up
filled
with
a
very
fine
paste
which
scarcely
effervesced
with
acid
and
dried
into
a
very
light
impalpable
white
powder
this
when
examined
under
the
microscope
was
found
to
consist
almost
entirely
of
the
frustules
of
diatoms
some
of
them
wonderfully
perfect
in
all
the
details
of
their
ornament
and
many
of
them
broken
up
the
species
of
diatoms
entering
into
this
deposit
have
not
yet
been
worked
up
but
they
appear
to
be
referable
chiefly
to
the
genera
coscinodiscus
choetoceros
and
with
fragments
of
the
separated
rods
of
a
singular
silicious
organism
with
which
we
were
unacquainted
and
which
made
up
a
large
proportion
of
the
finer
matter
of
this
deposit
mixed
with
the
diatoms
there
were
a
few
small
some
of
the
tests
and
spicules
of
radiolarians
and
some
sand
particles
but
these
foreign
bodies
were
in
too
small
proportion
to
affect
the
formation
as
consisting
practically
of
diatoms
alone
on
the
of
february
in
lat
a
little
to
the
north
of
the
heard
islands
the
dragging
a
few
fathoms
below
the
surface
came
up
nearly
filled
with
a
pale
yellow
gelatinous
mass
this
was
found
to
consist
entirely
of
diatoms
of
the
same
species
as
those
found
at
the
bottom
by
far
the
most
abundant
was
the
little
bundle
of
silicious
rods
fastened
together
loosely
at
one
end
separating
from
one
another
at
the
other
end
and
the
whole
bundle
loosely
twisted
into
a
spindle
the
rods
are
hollow
and
contain
the
characteristic
endochrome
of
the
like
the
ooze
then
which
it
succeeds
to
the
southward
in
a
band
apparently
of
no
great
width
the
materials
of
this
silicious
deposit
are
derived
entirely
from
the
surface
and
intermediate
depths
it
is
somewhat
singular
that
diatoms
did
not
appear
to
be
in
such
large
numbers
on
the
surface
over
the
diatom
ooze
as
they
were
a
little
further
north
this
may
perhaps
be
accounted
for
by
our
not
having
struck
their
belt
of
depth
with
the
or
it
is
possible
that
when
we
found
it
on
the
of
february
the
bottom
deposit
was
really
shifted
a
little
to
the
south
by
the
warm
current
the
excessively
fine
flocculent
of
the
diatoms
taking
a
certain
time
to
sink
the
belt
of
diatom
ooze
is
certainly
a
little
further
to
the
southward
in
long
in
the
path
of
the
reflux
of
the
agulhas
current
than
in
long
all
along
the
edge
of
the
everywhere
in
fact
to
the
south
of
the
two
stations
on
the
of
february
on
our
southward
voyage
and
on
the
of
march
on
our
return
we
brought
up
fine
sand
and
grayish
mud
with
small
pebbles
of
quartz
and
felspar
and
small
fragments
of
slate
gneiss
and
granite
this
deposit
i
have
no
doubt
was
derived
from
the
surface
like
the
others
but
in
this
case
by
the
melting
of
icebergs
and
the
precipitation
of
foreign
matter
contained
in
the
ice
we
never
saw
any
trace
of
gravel
or
sand
or
any
material
necessarily
derived
from
land
on
an
iceberg
several
showed
vertical
or
irregular
fissures
filled
with
discoloured
ice
or
snow
but
when
looked
at
closely
the
discoloration
proved
usually
to
be
very
slight
and
the
effect
at
a
distance
was
usually
due
to
the
foreign
material
filling
the
fissure
reflecting
light
less
perfectly
than
the
general
surface
of
the
berg
i
conceive
that
the
upper
surface
of
one
of
these
great
tabular
southern
icebergs
including
by
far
the
greater
part
of
its
bulk
and
culminating
in
the
portion
exposed
above
the
surface
of
the
sea
was
formed
by
the
piling
up
of
successive
layers
of
snow
during
the
period
amounting
perhaps
to
several
centuries
during
which
the
was
slowly
forcing
itself
over
the
low
land
and
out
to
sea
over
a
long
extent
of
gentle
slope
until
it
reached
a
depth
considerably
above
fathoms
when
the
lower
specific
weight
of
the
ice
caused
an
upward
strain
which
at
length
overcame
the
cohesion
of
the
mass
and
portions
were
rent
off
and
floated
away
if
this
be
the
true
history
of
the
formation
of
these
icebergs
the
absence
of
all
land
in
the
portion
exposed
above
the
surface
of
the
sea
is
readily
understood
if
any
such
exist
it
must
be
confined
to
the
lower
part
of
the
berg
to
that
part
which
has
at
one
time
or
other
moved
on
the
floor
of
the
the
icebergs
when
they
are
first
dispersed
float
in
from
to
fathoms
when
therefore
they
have
been
drifted
to
latitudes
of
or
the
bottom
of
the
berg
just
reaches
the
layer
at
which
the
temperature
of
the
water
is
distinctly
rising
and
it
is
rapidly
melted
and
the
mud
and
pebbles
with
which
it
is
more
or
less
charged
are
precipitated
that
this
precipitation
takes
place
all
over
the
area
where
the
icebergs
are
breaking
up
constantly
and
to
a
considerable
extent
is
evident
from
the
fact
of
the
soundings
being
entirely
composed
of
such
deposits
for
the
diatoms
and
radiolarians
are
present
on
the
surface
in
large
numbers
and
unless
the
deposit
from
the
ice
were
abundant
it
would
soon
be
covered
and
masked
by
a
layer
of
the
exuvia
of
surface
organisms
the
observations
which
have
been
detailed
leave
no
doubt
that
the
antarctic
sea
bottom
from
a
little
to
the
south
of
the
fiftieth
parallel
as
far
as
is
being
covered
by
a
fine
deposit
of
silicious
mud
more
or
less
mixed
in
some
parts
with
the
of
polar
lands
and
with
the
ejections
of
volcanoes
the
silicious
particles
which
constitute
this
mud
are
derived
in
part
from
the
diatomaceous
plants
and
radiolarian
animals
which
throng
the
surface
and
in
part
from
the
spicula
of
sponges
which
live
at
the
bottom
the
evidence
respecting
the
corresponding
arctic
area
is
less
complete
but
it
is
sufficient
to
justify
the
conclusion
that
an
essentially
similar
silicious
cap
is
being
formed
around
the
northern
pole
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
constituent
particles
of
this
mud
may
agglomerate
into
a
dense
rock
such
as
that
formed
at
oran
on
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
which
is
made
up
of
similar
materials
moreover
in
the
case
of
freshwater
deposits
of
this
kind
it
is
certain
that
the
action
of
percolating
water
may
convert
the
originally
soft
and
friable
sandstone
into
a
dense
opaline
stone
the
silicious
organized
skeletons
being
dissolved
and
the
silex
in
an
amorphous
state
whether
such
a
metamorphosis
as
this
occurs
in
submarine
deposits
as
well
as
in
those
formed
in
fresh
water
does
not
appear
but
there
seems
no
reason
to
doubt
that
it
may
and
hence
it
may
not
be
hazardous
to
conclude
that
very
ordinary
metamorphic
agencies
may
convert
these
polar
caps
into
a
form
of
quartzite
in
the
great
intermediate
zone
occupying
some
of
latitude
which
separates
the
circumpolar
arctic
and
antarctic
areas
of
silicious
deposit
the
diatoms
and
of
the
surface
water
and
the
sponges
of
the
bottom
do
not
die
out
and
so
far
as
some
forms
are
concerned
do
not
even
appear
to
diminish
in
total
number
though
on
a
rough
estimate
it
would
appear
that
the
proportion
of
to
diatoms
is
much
greater
than
in
the
colder
seas
nevertheless
the
composition
of
the
mud
of
this
intermediate
zone
is
entirely
different
from
that
of
the
circumpolar
regions
the
first
exact
information
respecting
the
nature
of
this
mud
at
depths
greater
than
fathoms
was
given
by
ehrenberg
in
the
account
which
he
published
in
the
monatsberichte
of
the
berlin
academy
for
the
year
of
the
soundings
obtained
by
lieut
berryman
of
the
united
states
navy
in
the
north
atlantic
between
newfoundland
and
the
azores
observations
which
confirm
those
of
ehrenberg
in
all
essential
respects
have
been
made
by
professor
bailey
myself
wallich
carpenter
and
professor
wyville
thomson
in
their
earlier
cruises
and
the
continuation
of
the
ooze
over
the
south
pacific
has
been
proved
by
the
recent
work
of
the
by
which
it
is
also
shown
for
the
first
time
that
in
passing
from
the
equator
to
high
southern
latitudes
the
number
and
variety
of
the
diminishes
and
even
the
become
dwarfed
and
this
result
it
will
be
observed
is
in
entire
accordance
with
the
fact
already
mentioned
that
in
the
sea
of
kamschatka
the
mud
was
found
by
bailey
to
contain
no
calcareous
organisms
thus
in
the
whole
of
the
intermediate
zone
the
silicious
deposit
which
is
being
formed
there
as
elsewhere
by
the
accumulation
of
spicula
and
diatoms
is
obscured
and
overpowered
by
the
immensely
greater
amount
of
calcareous
sediment
which
arises
from
the
aggregation
of
the
skeletons
of
dead
the
similarity
of
the
deposit
thus
composed
of
a
large
percentage
of
carbonate
of
lime
and
a
small
percentage
of
silex
to
chalk
regarded
merely
as
a
kind
of
rock
which
was
first
pointed
out
by
ehrenberg
is
now
admitted
on
all
hands
nor
can
it
be
reasonably
doubted
that
ordinary
metamorphic
agencies
are
competent
to
convert
the
modern
chalk
into
hard
limestone
or
even
into
crystalline
marble
footnote
the
following
passages
in
ehrenberg
memoir
on
organisms
in
the
chalk
which
are
still
are
conclusive
the
dawning
period
of
the
existing
living
organic
creation
if
such
a
period
is
distinguishable
which
is
doubtful
can
only
be
supposed
to
have
existed
on
the
other
side
of
and
below
the
chalk
formation
and
thus
either
the
chalk
with
its
widespread
and
thick
beds
must
enter
into
the
series
of
newer
formations
or
some
of
the
accepted
four
great
geological
periods
the
quaternary
tertiary
and
secondary
formations
contain
organisms
which
still
live
it
is
more
probable
in
the
proportion
of
to
that
the
transition
or
primary
period
is
not
different
but
that
it
is
only
more
difficult
to
examine
and
understand
by
reason
of
the
gradual
and
prolonged
chemical
decomposition
and
metamorphosis
of
many
of
its
organic
constituents
by
the
and
secondary
are
not
distinguishable
from
tertiary
formations
and
from
what
has
been
said
it
is
possible
that
at
this
very
day
rock
masses
are
forming
in
the
sea
and
being
raised
by
volcanic
agencies
the
constitution
of
which
on
the
whole
is
altogether
similar
to
that
of
the
chalk
the
chalk
remains
distinguishable
by
its
organic
remains
as
a
formation
but
not
as
a
kind
of
rock
ehrenberg
appears
to
have
taken
it
for
granted
that
the
and
other
which
are
found
in
the
mud
live
at
the
great
depths
in
which
their
remains
are
found
and
he
supports
this
opinion
by
producing
evidence
that
the
soft
parts
of
these
organisms
are
preserved
and
may
be
demonstrated
by
removing
the
calcareous
matter
with
dilute
acids
in
the
evidence
for
and
against
this
conclusion
appeared
to
me
to
be
insufficient
to
warrant
a
positive
conclusion
one
way
or
the
other
and
i
expressed
myself
in
my
report
to
the
admiralty
on
captain
dayman
soundings
in
the
following
terms
when
we
consider
the
immense
area
over
which
this
deposit
is
spread
the
depth
at
which
its
formation
is
going
on
and
its
similarity
to
chalk
and
still
more
to
such
rocks
as
the
marls
of
caltanisetta
the
question
whence
are
all
these
organisms
derived
becomes
one
of
high
scientific
interest
three
answers
have
suggested
themselves
in
accordance
with
the
prevalent
view
of
the
limitation
of
life
to
comparatively
small
depths
it
is
imagined
either
that
these
organisms
have
drifted
into
their
present
position
from
shallower
waters
or
that
they
habitually
live
at
the
surface
of
the
ocean
and
only
fall
down
into
their
present
position
i
conceive
that
the
first
supposition
is
negatived
by
the
extremely
marked
zoological
peculiarity
of
the
fauna
had
the
been
drifted
into
their
present
position
from
shallow
water
we
should
find
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
characteristic
inhabitants
of
shallow
waters
mixed
with
them
and
this
would
the
more
certainly
be
the
case
as
the
large
so
abundant
in
the
soundings
are
in
proportion
to
their
size
more
solid
and
massive
than
almost
any
other
but
the
fact
is
that
the
proportion
of
other
is
exceedingly
small
nor
have
i
found
as
yet
in
the
deposits
any
such
matters
as
fragments
of
molluscous
shells
of
which
abound
in
shallow
waters
and
are
quite
as
likely
to
be
drifted
as
the
heavy
again
the
relative
proportions
of
young
and
fully
formed
seem
inconsistent
with
the
notion
that
they
have
travelled
far
and
it
seems
difficult
to
imagine
why
had
the
deposit
been
accumulated
in
this
way
should
so
almost
entirely
represent
the
the
second
hypothesis
is
far
more
feasible
and
is
strongly
supported
by
the
fact
that
many
radiolaria
and
are
well
known
to
live
at
the
surface
of
the
ocean
macdonald
surgeon
of
now
in
the
pacific
has
lately
sent
home
some
very
valuable
observations
on
living
forms
of
this
kind
met
with
in
the
stomachs
of
oceanic
mollusks
and
therefore
certainly
inhabitants
of
the
superficial
layer
of
the
ocean
but
it
is
a
singular
circumstance
that
only
one
of
the
forms
figured
by
macdonald
is
at
all
like
a
and
there
are
some
peculiarities
about
even
this
which
make
me
greatly
doubt
its
affinity
with
that
genus
the
form
indeed
is
not
unlike
that
of
a
but
it
is
provided
with
long
radiating
processes
of
which
i
have
never
seen
any
trace
in
did
they
exist
they
might
explain
what
otherwise
is
a
great
objection
to
this
view
how
is
it
conceivable
that
the
heavy
should
maintain
itself
at
the
surface
of
the
water
if
the
organic
bodies
in
the
soundings
have
neither
been
drifted
nor
have
fallen
from
above
there
remains
but
one
alternative
they
must
have
lived
and
died
where
they
are
important
objections
however
at
once
suggest
themselves
to
this
view
how
can
animal
life
be
conceived
to
exist
under
such
conditions
of
light
temperature
pressure
and
aeration
as
must
obtain
at
these
vast
depths
to
this
one
can
only
reply
that
we
know
for
a
certainty
that
even
very
animals
do
continue
to
live
at
a
depth
of
and
fathoms
inasmuch
as
they
have
been
dredged
up
thence
and
that
the
difference
in
the
amount
of
light
and
heat
at
and
at
fathoms
is
probably
so
to
speak
very
far
less
than
the
difference
in
complexity
of
organisation
between
these
animals
and
the
humbler
and
of
the
soundings
i
confess
though
as
yet
far
from
regarding
it
proved
that
the
live
at
these
depths
the
balance
of
probabilities
seems
to
me
to
incline
in
that
direction
and
there
is
one
circumstance
which
weighs
strongly
in
my
mind
it
may
be
taken
as
a
law
that
any
genus
of
animals
which
is
found
far
back
in
time
is
capable
of
living
under
a
great
variety
of
circumstances
as
regards
light
temperature
and
pressure
now
the
genus
is
abundantly
represented
in
the
cretaceous
epoch
and
perhaps
earlier
i
abstain
however
at
present
from
drawing
any
positive
conclusions
preferring
rather
to
await
the
result
of
more
extended
observations

surrounded
by
a

gives

dots

can
now
be
no

therefore
that
live
at

top
of

but
the
question
may
still
be
raised
whether
they
do
not
also
live
at
the
bottom
in
favour
of
this
view
it
has
been
urged
that
the
shells
of
the
of
the
surface
never
possess
such
thick
walls
as
those
which
are
fouled
at
the
bottom
but
i
confess
that
i
doubt
the
accuracy
of
this
statement
again
the
occurrence
of
minute
in
all
stages
of
development
at
the
greatest
depths
is
brought
forward
as
evidence
that
they
live
but
considering
the
extent
to
which
the
surface
organisms
are
devoured
without
discrimination
of
young
and
old
by
and
the
like
it
is
not
wonderful
that
shells
of
all
ages
should
be
among
the
rejectamenta
nor
can
the
presence
of
the
soft
parts
of
the
body
in
the
shells
which
form
the
ooze
and
the
fact
if
it
be
one
that
animals
living
at
the
bottom
use
them
as
food
be
considered
as
conclusive
evidence
that
the
live
at
the
bottom
such
as
die
at
the
surface
and
even
many
of
those
which
are
swallowed
by
other
animals
may
retain
much
of
their
protoplasmic
matter
when
they
reach
the
depths
at
which
the
temperature
sinks
to
or
fahrenheit
where
decomposition
must
become
exceedingly
slow
another
consideration
appears
to
me
to
be
in
favour
of
the
view
that
the
and
their
allies
are
essentially
surface
animals
this
is
the
fact
brought
out
by
the
work
that
they
have
a
southern
limit
of
distribution
which
can
hardly
depend
upon
anything
but
the
temperature
of
the
surface
water
and
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
this
southern
limit
occurs
at
a
lower
latitude
in
the
antarctic
seas
than
it
does
in
the
north
atlantic
according
to
wallich
the
north
atlantic
sea
bed
is
the
prevailing
form
in
the
deposits
between
the
faroe
islands
and
iceland
and
between
iceland
and
east
greenland
or
in
other
words
in
a
region
of
the
which
lies
altogether
north
of
the
parallel
of
while
in
the
southern
seas
the

dwarfed
and
almost
disappear
between
and
on
the
other
hand
in
the
sea
of
kamschatka
the
have
vanished
in
so
that
the
persistence
of
the
ooze
in
high
latitudes
in
the
north
atlantic
would
seem
to
depend
on
the
northward
curve
of
the
isothermals
peculiar
to
this
region
and
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
the
formation
of
ooze
can
be
affected
by
this
climatal
peculiarity
unless
it
be
effected
by
surface
animals
whatever
may
be
the
mode
of
life
of
the
to
which
the
calcareous
element
of
the
chalk
owes
its
existence
the
fact
that
it
is
the
chief
and
most
widely
spread
material
of
the

the
intermediate
zone
throughout
both
the
atlantic
and
pacific
oceans
and
the
indian

from
a
few
hundred
to
over
two
thousand

established

it
is
not

is
now
taking
place

pourtalès
an
officer
of
the
united
states
coast
survey
which
has
done
so
much
for
scientific
hydrography
observed
that
the
mud
forming
the
at
depths
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
fathoms
in
off
the
coast
of
florida
was
a
mixture
in
about
equal
proportions
of
and
black
sand
probably
greensand
as
it
makes
a
green
mark
when
crushed
on
paper
professor
bailey
examining
these
grains
microscopically
found
that
they
were
casts
of
the
interior
cavities
of
consisting
of
a
mineral
known
as
which
is
a
silicate
of
iron
and
alumina
in
these
casts
the
minutest
cavities
and
finest
tubes
in
the
foraminifer
were
sornetilnes
reproduced
in
solid
counterparts
of
the
glassy
mineral
while
the
calcareous
original
had
been
entirely
dissolved
away
contemporaneously
with
these
observations
the
indefatigable
ehrenberg
had
discovered
that
the
greensands
of
the
geologist
were
largely
made
up
of
casts
of
a
similar
character
and
proved
the
existence
of
at
a
very
ancient
geological
epoch
by
discovering
such
casts
in
a
greensand
of
lower
silurian
age
which
occurs
near
petersburg
subsequently
parker
and
jones
discovered
similar
casts
in
process
of
formation
the
original
shell
not
having
disappeared
in
specimens
of
the
of
the
australian
seas
brought
home
by
the
late
professor
jukes
and
the
has
observed
a
deposit
of
a
similar
character
in
the
course
of
the
agulhas
current
near
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
in
some
other
localities
not
yet
defined
it
would
appear
that
this
infiltration
of
shells
with
does
not
take
place
at
great
depths
but
rather
in
what
may
be
termed
a
sublittoral
region
ranging
from
a
hundred
to
three
hundred
fathoms
it
can
not
be
ascribed
to
any
local
cause
for
it
takes
place
not
only
over
large
areas
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
the
coast
of
florida
but
in
the
south
atlantic
and
in
the
pacific
but
what
are
the
conditions
which
determine
its
occurrence
and
whence
the
silex
the
iron
and
the
alumina
with
perhaps
potash
and
some
other
ingredients
in
small
quantity
of
which
the
is
composed
proceed
is
a
point
on
which
no
light
has
yet
been
thrown
for
the
present
we
must
be
content
with
the
fact
that
in
certain
areas
of
the
intermediate
zone
greensand
is
replacing
and
representing
the
primitively
silicious
ooze
the
investigation
of
the
deposits
which
are
now
being
formed
in
the
basin
of
the
mediterranean
by
the
late
professor
edward
forbes
by
professor
williamson
and
more
recently
by
carpenter
and
a
comparison
of
the
results
thus
obtained
with
what
is
known
of
the
surface
fauna
have
brought
to
light
the
remarkable
fact
that
while
the
surface
and
the
shallows
abound
with
and
other
calcareous
shelled
organisms
the
indications
of
life
become
scanty
at
depths
beyond
or
fathoms
while
almost
all
traces
of
it
disappear
at
greater
depths
and
at
to
fathoms
the
bottom
is
covered
with
a
fine
clay
carpenter
has
discussed
the
significance
of
this
remarkable
fact
and
he
is
disposed
to
attribute
the
absence
of
life
at
great
depths
partly
to
the
absence
of
any
circulation
of
the
water
of
the
mediterranean
at
such
depths
and
partly
to
the
exhaustion
of
the
oxygen
of
the
water
by
the
organic
matter
contained
in
the
fine
clay
which
he
conceives
to
be
formed
by
the
finest
particles
of
the
mud
brought
down
by
the
rivers
which
flow
into
the
mediterranean
however
this
may
be
the
explanation
thus
offered
of
the
presence
of
the
fine
mud
and
of
the
absence
of
organisms
which
ordinarily
live
at
the
bottom
does
not
account
for
the
absence
of
the
skeletons
of
the
organisms
which
undoubtedly
abound
at
the
surface
of
the
mediterranean
and
it
would
seem
to
have
no
application
to
the
remarkable
fact
discovered
by
the
that
in
the
open
atlantic
and
pacific
oceans
in
the
midst
of
the
great
intermediate
zone
and
thousands
of
miles
away
from
the
embouchure
of
any
river
the
at
depths
approaching
to
and
beyond
fathoms
no
longer
consists
of
ooze
but
of
an
excessively
fine
red
clay
professor
thomson
gives
the
following
account
of
this
capital
discovery
according
to
our
present
experience
the
deposit
of
ooze
is
limited
to
water
of
a
certain
depth
the
extreme
limit
of
the
pure
characteristic
formation
being
placed
at
a
depth
of
somewhere
about
fathoms
crossing
from
these
shallower
regions
occupied
by
the
ooze
into
deeper
soundings
we
find
universally
that
the
calcareous
formation
gradually
passes
into
and
is
finally
replaced
by
an
extremely
fine
pure
clay
which
occupies
speaking
generally
all
depths
below
fathoms
and
consists
almost
entirely
of
a
silicate
of
the
red
oxide
of
iron
and
alumina
the
transition
is
very
slow
and
extends
over
several
hundred
fathoms
of
increasing
depth
the
shells
gradually
lose
their
sharpness
of
outline
and
assume
a
kind
of
look
and
a
brownish
colour
and
become
more
and
more
mixed
with
a
fine
amorphous
powder
which
increases
steadily
in
proportion
until
the
lime
has
almost
entirely
disappeared
this
brown
matter
is
in
the
finest
possible
state
of
subdivision
so
fine
that
when
after
sifting
it
to
separate
any
organisms
it
might
contain
we
put
it
into
jars
to
settle
it
remained
for
days
in
suspension
giving
the
water
very
much
the
appearance
and
colour
of
chocolate
in
indicating
the
nature
of
the
bottom
on
the
charts
we
came
from
experience
and
without
any
theoretical
considerations
to
use
three
terms
for
soundings
in
deep
water
two
of
these
gl
oz
and
r
were
very
definite
and
indicated
formations
with
apparently
but
few
characters
in
common
but
we
frequently
got
soundings
which
we
could
not
exactly
call
ooze
or
clay
and
before
we
were
fully
aware
of
the
nature
of
these
we
were
in
the
habit
of
indicating
them
as
ooze
gr
oz
we
now
recognise
the
ooze
as
an
intermediate
stage
between
the
ooze
and
the
red
clay
we
find
that
on
one
side
as
it
were
of
an
ideal
line
the
red
clay
contains
more
and
more
of
the
material
of
the
calcareous
ooze
while
on
the
other
the
ooze
is
mixed
with
an
increasing
proportion
of
clay
although
we
have
met
with
the
same
phenomenon
so
frequently
that
we
were
at
length
able
to
predict
the
nature
of
the
bottom
from
the
depth
of
the
soundings
with
absolute
certainty
for
the
atlantic
and
the
southern
sea
we
had
perhaps
the
best
opportunity
of
observing
it
in
our
first
section
across
the
atlantic
between
teneriffe
and
thomas
the
first
four
stations
on
this
section
at
depths
from
to
fathoms
show
ooze
from
the
last
of
these
which
is
about
miles
from
teneriffe
the
depth
gradually
increases
to
fathoms
at
and
fathoms
at
miles
from
teneriffe
the
bottom
in
these
two
soundings
might
have
been
called
ooze
for
although
its
nature
has
altered
entirely
from
the
ooze
the
red
clay
into
which
it
is
rapidly
passing
still
contains
a
considerable
admixture
of
carbonate
of
lime
the
depth
goes
on
increasing
to
a
distance
of
miles
from
teneriffe
when
it
reaches
fathoms
there
the
clay
is
pure
and
smooth
and
contains
scarcely
a
trace
of
lime
from
this
great
depth
the
bottom
gradually
rises
and
with
decreasing
depth
the
grey
colour
and
the
calcareous
composition
of
the
ooze
return
three
soundings
in
and
fathoms
on
the
rise
gave
highly
characteristic
examples
of
the
formation
passing
from
the
middle
plateau
of
the
atlantic
into
the
western
trough
with
depths
a
little
over
fathoms
the
red
clay
returned
in
all
its
purity
and
our
last
sounding
in
fathoms
before
reaching
sombrero
restored
the
ooze
with
its
peculiar
associated
fauna
this
section
shows
also
the
wide
extension
and
the
vast
geological
importance
of
the
red
clay
formation
the
total
distance
from
teneriffe
to
sombrero
is
about
miles
proceeding
from
east
to
west
we
have
about
miles
of
volcanic
mud
and
sand
ooze
red
clay
ooze
red
clay
ooze
giving
a
total
of
miles
of
red
clay
to
miles
of
ooze
the
nature
and
origin
of
this
vast
deposit
of
clay
is
a
question
of
the
very
greatest
interest
and
although
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
is
in
the
main
solved
yet
some
matters
of
detail
are
still
involved
in
difficulty
my
first
impression
was
that
it
might
be
the
most
minutely
divided
material
the
ultimate
sediment
produced
by
the
disintegration
of
the
land
by
rivers
and
by
the
action
of
the
sea
on
exposed
coasts
and
held
in
suspension
and
distributed
by
ocean
currents
and
only
making
itself
manifest
in
places
unoccupied
by
the
ooze
several
circumstances
seemed
however
to
negative
this
mode
of
origin
the
formation
seemed
too
uniform
wherever
we
met
with
it
it
had
the
same
character
and
it
only
varied
in
composition
in
containing
less
or
more
carbonate
of
lime
again
the
were
gradually
becoming
more
and
more
convinced
that
all
the
important
elements
of
the
ooze
lived
on
the
surface
and
it
seemed
evident
that
so
long
as
the
condition
on
the
surface
remained
the
same
no
alteration
of
contour
at
the
bottom
could
possibly
prevent
its
accumulation
and
the
surface
conditions
in
the
were
very
uniform
a
moderate
current
of
a
very
equal
temperature
passing
continuously
over
elevations
and
depressions
and
everywhere
yielding
to
the
the
in
the
same
proportion
the
swarms
with
pelagic
and
in
moderate
depths
the
shells
of
these
are
constantly
mixed
with
the
ooze
sometimes
in
number
sufficient
to
make
up
a
considerable
portion
of
its
bulk
it
is
clear
that
these
shells
must
fall
in
equal
numbers
upon
the
red
clay
but
scarcely
a
trace
of
one
of
them
is
ever
brought
up
by
the
dredge
on
the
red
clay
area
it
might
be
possible
to
explain
the
absence
of
animals
living
on
the
bottom
on
the
supposition
that
the
nature
of
the
deposit
was
injurious
to
them
but
then
the
idea
of
a
current
sufficiently
strong
to
sweep
them
away
is
negatived
by
the
extreme
fineness
of
the
sediment
which
is
being
laid
down
the
absence
of
surface
shells
appears
to
be
intelligible
only
on
the
supposition
that
they
are
in
some
way
removed
we
conclude
therefore
that
the
clay
is
not
an
additional
substance
introduced
from
without
and
occupying
certain
depressed
regions
on
account
of
some
law
regulating
its
deposition
but
that
it
is
produced
by
the
removal
by
some
means
or
other
over
these
areas
of
the
carbonate
of
lime
which
forms
probably
about
per
cent
of
the
material
of
the
ooze
we
can
trace
indeed
every
successive
stage
in
the
removal
of
the
carbonate
of
lime
in
descending
the
slope
of
the
ridge
or
plateau
where
the
ooze
is
forming
to
the
region
of
the
clay
we
find
first
that
the
shells
of
pteropods
and
other
surface
which
are
constantly
falling
on
the
bottom
are
absent
or
if
a
few
remain
they
are
brittle
and
yellow
and
evidently
decaying
rapidly
these
shells
of
decompose
more
easily
and
disappear
sooner
than
the
smaller
and
apparently
more
delicate
shells
of
rhizopods
the
smaller
now
give
way
and
are
found
in
lessening
proportion
to
the
larger
the
coccoliths
first
lose
their
thin
outer
border
and
then
disappear
and
the
clubs
of
the
rhabdoliths
get
worn
out
of
shape
and
are
last
seen
under
a
high
power
as
infinitely
minute
cylinders
scattered
over
the
field
the
larger
are
attacked
and
instead
of
being
vividly
white
and
delicately
sculptured
they
become
brown
and
worn
and
finally
they
break
up
each
according
to
its
fashion
the
of
fall
into
pieces
which
quickly
disappear
and
a
thick
rough
crust
breaks
away
from
the
surface
of
leaving
a
thin
inner
sphere
at
first
beautifully
transparent
but
soon
becoming
opaque
and
crumbling
away
in
the
meantime
the
proportion
of
the
amorphous
clay
to
the
calcareous
elements
of
all
kinds
increases
until
the
latter
disappear
with
the
exception
of
a
few
scattered
shells
of
the
larger
which
are
still
found
even
in
the
most
characteristic
samples
of
the
clay
there
seems
to
be
no
room
left
for
doubt
that
the
red
clay
is
essentially
the
insoluble
residue
the
as
it
were
of
the
calcareous
organisms
which
form
the
ooze
after
the
calcareous
matter
has
been
by
some
means
removed
an
ordinary
mixture
of
calcareous
with
the
shells
of
pteropods
forming
a
fair
sample
of
ooze
from
near
thomas
was
carefully
washed
and
subjected
by
buchanan
to
the
action
of
weak
acid
and
he
found
that
there
remained
after
the
carbonate
of
lime
had
been
removed
about
per
cent
of
a
reddish
mud
consisting
of
silica
alumina
and
the
red
oxide
of
iron
this
experiment
has
been
frequently
repeated
with
different
samples
of
ooze
and
always
with
the
result
that
a
small
proportion
of
a
red
sediment
remains
which
possesses
all
the
characters
of
the
red
clay
it
seems
evident
from
the
observations
here
recorded
that
which
we
have
hitherto
looked
upon
as
essentially
the
product
of
the
disintegration
of
older
rocks
may
be
under
certain
circumstances
an
organic
formation
like
chalk
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
an
area
on
the
surface
of
the
globe
which
we
have
shown
to
be
of
vast
extent
although
we
are
still
far
from
having
ascertained
its
limits
is
being
covered
by
such
a
deposit
at
the
present
day
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
associating
such
a
formation
with
the
fine
smooth
homogeneous
clays
and
schists
poor
in
fossils
but
showing
tubes
and
tracks
and
bunches
of
doubtful
branching
things
such
as
oldhamia
silicious
sponges
and
peculiar
shrimps
such
formations
more
or
less
metamorphosed
are
very
familiar
especially
to
the
student
of
palaeozoic
geology
and
they
often
attain
a
vast
thickness
one
is
inclined
from
the
great
resemblance
between
them
in
composition
and
in
the
general
character
of
the
included
fauna
to
suspect
that
these
may
be
organic
formations
like
the
modern
red
clay
of
the
atlantic
and
southern
sea
accumulations
of
the
insoluble
ashes
of
shelled
creatures
the
dredging
in
the
red
clay
on
the
of
march
was
usually
rich
the
bag
contained
examples
those
with
calcareous
shells
rather
stunted
of
most
of
the
characteristic
groups
of
the
southern
sea
including
euplectella
pterocrinus
brisinga
ophioglypha
and
one
or
two
this
is
however
very
rarely
the
case
generally
the
red
clay
is
barren
or
contains
only
a
very
small
number
of
forms
it
must
be
admitted
that
it
is
very
difficult
at
present
to
frame
any
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
mode
of
origin
of
this
singular
deposit
of
red
clay
i
can
not
say
that
the
theory
put
forward
tentatively
and
with
much
reservation
by
professor
thomson
that
the
calcareous
matter
is
dissolved
out
by
the
relatively
fresh
water
of
the
deep
currents
from
the
antarctic
regions
appears
satisfactory
to
me
nor
do
i
see
my
way
to
the
acceptance
of
the
suggestion
of
carpenter
that
the
red
clay
is
the
result
of
the
decomposition
of
greensand
at
present
there
is
no
evidence
that
greensand
casts
are
ever
formed
at
great
depths
nor
has
it
been
proved
that
is
decomposable
by
the
agency
of
water
and
carbonic
acid
i
think
it
probable
that
we
shall
have
to
wait
some
time
for
a
sufficient
explanation
of
the
origin
of
the
abyssal
red
clay
no
less
than
for
that
of
the
sublittoral
greensand
in
the
intermediate
zone
but
the
importance
of
the
establishment
of
the
fact
that
these
various
deposits
are
being
formed
in
the
ocean
at
the
present
day
remains
the
same
whether
its
be
understood
or
not
for
suppose
the
globe
to
be
evenly
covered
with
sea
to
a
depth
say
of
a
thousand
fathoms
then
whatever
might
be
the
mineral
matter
composing
the
little
or
no
deposit
would
be
formed
upon
it
the
abrading
and
denuding
action
of
water
at
such
a
depth
being
exceedingly
slight
next
imagine
sponges
and
diatomaceous
plants
such
as
those
which
now
exist
in
the
to
be
introduced
they
would
be
distributed
according
to
the
same
laws
as
at
present
the
sponges
and
possibly
some
of
the
covering
the
bottom
while
other
with
the
and
would
increase
and
multiply
in
the
surface
waters
in
accordance
with
the
existing
state
of
things
the
and
diatoms
would
have
a
universal
distribution
the
latter
gathering
most
thickly
in
the
polar
regions
while
the
would
be
largely
if
not
exclusively
confined
to
the
intermediate
zone
and
as
a
consequence
of
this
distribution
a
bed
of
chalk
would
begin
to
form
in
the
intermediate
zone
while
caps
of
silicious
rock
would
accumulate
on
the
circumpolar
regions
suppose
further
that
a
part
of
the
intermediate
area
were
raised
to
within
two
or
three
hundred
fathoms
of
the
surface
for
anything
that
we
know
to
the
contrary
the
change
of
level
might
determine
the
substitution
of
greensand
for
the
chalk
while
on
the
other
hand
if
part
of
the
same
area
were
depressed
to
three
thousand
fathoms
that
change
might
determine
the
substitution
of
a
different
silicate
of
alumina
and
iron
namely
clay
for
the
chalk
that
would
otherwise
be
formed
if
the
hypothesis
that
the
red
clay
is
the
residue
left
by
dissolved
skeletons
is
correct
then
all
these
deposits
alike
would
be
directly
or
indirectly
the
product
of
living
organisms
but
just
as
a
silicious
deposit
may
be
metamorphosed
into
opal
or
quartzite
and
chalk
into
marble
so
known
metamorphic
agencies
may
metamorphose
clay
into
schist
slate
gneiss
or
even
granite
and
thus
by
the
agency
of
the
lowest
and
simplest
of
organisms
our
imaginary
globe
might
be
covered
with
strata
of
all
the
chief
kinds
of
rock
of
which
the
known
crust
of
the
earth
is
composed
of
indefinite
thickness
and
extent
the
bearing
of
the
conclusions
which
are
now
either
established
or
highly
probable
respecting
the
origin
of
silicious
calcareous
and
clayey
rocks
and
their
metamorphic
derivatives
upon
the
archaeology
of
the
earth
the
elucidation
of
which
is
the
ultimate
object
of
the
geologist
is
of
no
small
importance
a
hundred
years
ago
the
singular
insight
of
linnaeus
enabled
him
to
say
that
fossils
are
not
the
children
but
the
parents
of
rocks
and
the
whole
effect
of
the
discoveries
made
since
his
time
has
been
to
compile
a
larger
and
larger
commentary
upon
this
text
it
is
at
present
a
perfectly
tenable
hypothesis
that
all
siliceous
and
calcareous
rocks
are
either
directly
or
indirectly
derived
from
material
which
has
at
one
time
or
other
formed
part
of
the
organized
framework
of
living
organisms
whether
the
same
generalization
may
be
extended
to
aluminous
rocks
depends
upon
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
the
facts
respecting
the
red
clay
areas
brought
to
light
by
the
if
we
accept
the
view
taken
by
wyville
thomson
and
his
colleagues
that
the
red
clay
is
the
residuum
left
after
the
calcareous
matter
of
the
ooze
has
been
dissolved
away
then
clay
is
as
much
a
product
of
life
as
limestone
and
all
known
derivatives
of
clay
may
have
formed
part
of
animal
bodies

long

the

the
hypothesis
as
i
may
term
it
must
be
accepted
with
reserve
and
provisionally
but
at
present
i
can
not
but
think
that
it
is
more
probable
than
any
other
suggestion
which
has
been
made
accepting
it
provisionally
we
arrive
at
the
remarkable
result
that
all
the
chief
known
constituents
of
the
crust
of
the
earth
may
have
formed
part
of
living
bodies
that
they
may
be
the
ash
of
protoplasm
that
the
are
not
only
temporis
but
and
consequently
that
the
time
during
which
life
has
been
active
on
the
globe
may
be
indefinitely
greater
than
the
period
the
commencement
of
which
is
marked
by
the
oldest
known
rocks
whether
fossiliferous
or
unfossiliferous
and
thus
we
are
led
to
see
where
the
solution
of
a
great
problem
and
apparent
paradox
of
geology
may
lie
satisfactory
evidence
now
exists
that
some
animals
in
the
existing
world
have
been
derived
by
a
process
of
gradual
modification
from
forms
it
is
undeniable
for
example
that
the
evidence
in
favour
of
the
derivation
of
the
horse
from
the
later
tertiary
and
that
of
the
from
is
as
complete
and
cogent
as
such
evidence
can
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
and
the
further
investigations
into
the
history
of
the
tertiary
mammalia
are
pushed
the
greater
is
the
accumulation
of
evidence
having
the
same
tendency
so
far
from
palaeontology
lending
no
support
to
the
doctrine
of
evolution
as
one
sees
constantly
asserted
that
doctrine
if
it
had
no
other
support
would
have
been
irresistibly
forced
upon
us
by
the
palaeontological
discoveries
of
the
last
twenty
years
if
however
the
diverse
forms
of
life
which
now
exist
have
been
produced
by
the
modification
of
less
divergent
forms
the
recent
and
extinct
species
taken
as
a
whole
must
fall
into
series
which
must
converge
as
we
go
back
in
time
hence
if
the
period
represented
by
the
rocks
is
greater
than
or
with
that
during
which
life
has
existed
we
ought
somewhere
among
the
ancient
formations
to
arrive
at
the
point
to
which
all
these
series
converge
or
from
which
in
other
words
they
have
diverged
the
primitive
undifferentiated
protoplasmic
living
things
whence
the
two
great
series
of
plants
and
animals
have
taken
their
departure
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
amount
of
convergence
of
series
in
relation
to
the
time
occupied
by
the
deposition
of
geological
formations
is
extraordinarily
small
of
all
animals
the
higher
are
the
most
complex
and
among
these
the
carnivores
and
hoofed
animals
are
highly
differentiated
nevertheless
although
the
different
lines
of
modification
of
the
and
those
of
the
respectively
approach
one
another
and
although
each
group
is
represented
by
less
differentiated
forms
in
the
older
tertiary
rocks
than
at
the
present
day
the
oldest
tertiary
rocks
do
not
bring
us
near
the
primitive
form
of
either
if
in
the
same
way
the
convergence
of
the
varied
forms
of
reptiles
is
measured
against
the
time
during
which
their
remains
are
preserved
which
is
represented
by
the
whole
of
the
tertiary
and
mesozoic
formations
the
amount
of
that
convergence
is
far
smaller
than
that
of
the
lines
of
mammals
between
the
present
time
and
the
beginning
of
the
tertiary
epoch
and
it
is
a
broad
fact
that
the
lower
we
go
in
the
scale
of
organization
the
fewer
signs
are
there
of
convergence
towards
the
primitive
form
from
whence
all
must
have
diverged
if
evolution
be
a
fact
nevertheless
that
it
is
a
fact
in
some
cases
is
proved
and
i
for
one
have
not
the
courage
to
suppose
that
the
mode
in
which
some
species
have
taken
their
origin
is
different
from
that
in
which
the
rest
have
originated
what
then
has
become
of
all
the
marine
animals
which
on
the
hypothesis
of
evolution
must
have
existed
in
myriads
in
those
seas
wherein
the
many
thousand
feet
of
cambrian
and
laurentian
rocks
now
devoid
or
almost
devoid
of
any
trace
of
life
were
deposited
sir
charles
lyell
long
ago
suggested
that
the
azoic
character
of
these
ancient
formations
might
be
due
to
the
fact
that
they
had
undergone
extensive
metamorphosis
and
readers
of
the
principles
of
geology
will
be
familiar
with
the
ingenious
manner
in
which
he
contrasts
the
theory
of
the
gnome
who
is
acquainted
only
with
the
interior
of
the
earth
with
those
of
ordinary
philosophers
who
know
only
its
exterior
the
metamorphism
contemplated
by
the
great
modern
champion
of
rational
geology
is
mainly
that
brought
about
by
the
exposure
of
rocks
to
subterranean
heat
and
where
no
such
heat
could
be
shown
to
have
operated
his
opponents
assumed
that
no
metamorphosis
could
have
taken
place
but
the
formation
of
greensand
and
still
more
that
of
the
red
clay
if
the
hypothesis
be
correct
affords
an
insight
into
a
new
kind
of
metamorphosis
not
igneous
but
aqueous
by
which
the
primitive
nature
of
a
deposit
may
be
masked
as
completely
as
it
can
be
by
the
agency
of
heat
and
as
wyville
thomson
suggests
in
the
passage
i
have
quoted
above
it
further
enables
us
to
assign
a
new
cause
for
the
occurrence
so
puzzling
hitherto
of
thousands
of
feet
of
unfossiliferous
schists
and
slates
in
the
midst
of
formations
deposited
in
seas
which
certainly
abounded
in
life
if
the
great
deposit
of
red
clay
now
forming
in
the
eastern
valley
of
the
atlantic
were
metamorphosed
into
slate
and
then
upheaved
it
would
constitute
an
azoic
rock
of
enormous
extent
and
yet
that
rock
is
now
forming
in
the
midst
of
a
sea
which
swarms
with
living
beings
the
great
majority
of
which
are
provided
with
calcareous
or
silicious
shells
and
skeletons
and
therefore
are
such
as
up
to
this
time
we
should
have
termed
eminently
preservable
thus
the
discoveries
made
by
the
expedition
like
all
recent
advances
in
our
knowledge
of
the
phenomena
of
biology
or
of
the
changes
now
being
effected
in
the
structure
of
the
surface
of
the
earth
are
in
accordance
with
and
lend
strong
support
to
that
doctrine
of
uniformitarianism
which
fifty
years
ago
was
held
only
by
a
small
minority
of
english
geologists
lyell
scrope
and
de
la
beche
but
now
thanks
to
the
labours
of
the
first
two
and
mainly
to
those
of
sir
charles
lyell
has
gradually
passed
from
the
position
of
a
heresy
to
that
of
catholic
doctrine
applied
within
the
limits
of
the
time
registered
by
the
known
fraction
of
the
crust
of
the
earth
i
believe
that
uniformitarianism
is
unassailable
the
evidence
that
in
the
enormous
lapse
of
time
between
the
deposition
of
the
lowest
laurentian
strata
and
the
present
day
the
forces
which
have
modified
the
surface
of
the
crust
of
the
earth
were
different
in
kind
or
greater
in
the
intensity
of
their
action
than
those
which
are
now
occupied
in
the
same
work
has
yet
to
be
produced
such
evidence
as
we
possess
all
tends
in
the
contrary
direction
and
is
in
favour
of
the
same
slow
and
gradual
changes
occurring
then
as
now
but
this
conclusion
in
nowise
conflicts
with
the
deductions
of
the
physicist
from
his
no
less
clear
and
certain
data
it
may
be
certain
that
this
globe
has
cooled
down
from
a
condition
in
which
life
could
not
have
existed
it
may
be
certain
that
in
so
cooling
its
contracting
crust
must
have
undergone
sudden
convulsions
which
were
to
our
earthquakes
as
an
earthquake
is
to
the
vibration
caused
by
the
periodical
eruption
of
a
geyser
but
in
that
case
the
earth
must
like
other
respectable
parents
have
sowed
her
wild
oats
and
got
through
her
turbulent
youth
before
we
her
children
have
any
knowledge
of
her
so
far
as
the
evidence
afforded
by
the
superficial
crust
of
the
earth
goes
the
modern
geologist
can
repeat
the
saying
of
hutton
we
find
no
vestige
of
a
beginning
no
prospect
of
an
end
however
he
will
add
with
hutton
but
in
thus
tracing
back
the
natural
operations
which
have
succeeded
each
other
and
mark
to
us
the
course
of
time
past
we
come
to
a
period
in
which
we
can
not
see
any
further
and
if
he
seek
to
peer
into
the
darkness
of
this
period
he
will
welcome
the
light
proffered
by
physics
and
mathematics
iv
yeast
it
has
been
known
from
time
immemorial
that
the
sweet
liquids
which
may
be
obtained
by
expressing
the
juices
of
the
fruits
and
stems
of
various
plants
or
by
steeping
malted
barley
in
hot
water
or
by
mixing
honey
with
water
are
liable
to
undergo
a
series
of
very
singular
changes
if
freely
exposed
to
the
air
and
left
to
themselves
in
warm
weather
however
clear
and
pellucid
the
liquid
may
have
been
when
first
prepared
however
carefully
it
may
have
been
freed
by
straining
and
filtration
from
even
the
finest
visible
impurities
it
will
not
remain
clear
after
a
time
it
will
become
cloudy
and
turbid
little
bubbles
will
be
seen
rising
to
the
surface
and
their
abundance
will
increase
until
the
liquid
hisses
as
if
it
were
simmering
on
the
fire
by
degrees
some
of
the
solid
particles
which
produce
the
turbidity
of
the
liquid
collect
at
its
surface
into
a
scum
which
is
blown
up
by
the
emerging
into

thick
foamy
froth
another
moiety
sinks
to
the
bottom
and
accumulates
as
a
muddy
sediment
or
lees

this
action
has
continued
with
more
or
less
violence
for
a
certain
time
it
gradually
moderates
the
evolution
of
bubbles
slackens
and
finally
comes
to
an
end
scum
and
lees
alike
settle
at
the
bottom
and
the
fluid
is
once
more
clear
and
transparent
but
it
has
acquired
properties
of
which
no
trace
existed
in
the
original
liquid
instead
of
being
a
mere
sweet
fluid
mainly
composed
of
sugar
and
water
the
sugar
has
more
or
less
completely
disappeared
and
it
has
acquired
that
peculiar
smell
and
taste
which
we
call
spirituous
instead
of
being
devoid
of
any
obvious
effect
upon
the
animal
economy
it
has
become
possessed
of
a
very
wonderful
influence
on
the
nervous
system
so
that
in
small
doses
it
exhilarates
while
in
larger
it
stupefies
and
may
even
destroy
life
moreover
if
the
original
fluid
is
put
into
a
still
and
heated
moderately
the
first
and
last
product
of
its
distillation
is
simple
water
while
when
the
altered
fluid
is
subjected
to
the
same
process
the
matter
which
is
first
condensed
in
the
receiver
is
found
to
be
a
clear
volatile
substance
which
is
lighter
than
water
has
a
pungent
taste
and
smell
possesses
the
intoxicating
powers
of
the
fluid
in
an
eminent
degree
and
takes
fire
the
moment
it
is
brought
in
contact
with
a
flame
the
alchemists
called
this
volatile
liquid
which
they
obtained
from
wine
spirits
of
wine
just
as
they
called
hydrochloric
acid
spirits
of
salt
and
as
we
to
this
day
call
refined
turpentine
spirits
of
turpentine
as
the
spiritus
or
breath
of
a
man
was
thought
to
be
the
most
refined
and
subtle
part
of
him
the
intelligent
essence
of
man
was
also
conceived
as
a
sort
of
breath
or
spirit
and
by
analogy
the
most
refined
essence
of
anything
was
called
its
spirit
and
thus
it
has
come
about
that
we
use
the
same
word
for
the
soul

we
even

another

and
its
origin
is
not
less
singular
the
dutch
physician
van
helmont
lived
in
the
latter
part
of
the
sixteenth
and
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
in
the
transition
period
between
alchemy
and
chemistry
and
was
rather
more
alchemist
than
chemist
appended
to

is
a

robert
boyle
speaks
of
a
fine
powder
as
alcohol
and
so
late
as
the
middle
of
the
last
century
the
english
lexicographer
nathan
bailey
defines
alcohol
as
the
pure
substance
of
anything
separated
from
the
more
gross
a
very
fine
and
impalpable
powder
or
a
very
pure
spirit
but
by
the
time
of
the
publication
of
lavoisier
traité
elémentaire
de
chimie
in
the
term
alcohol
alkohol
or
alkool
for
it
is
spelt
in
all
three
ways
which
van
helmont
had
applied
primarily
to
a
fine
powder
and
only
secondarily
to
spirits
of
wine
had
lost
its
primary
meaning
altogether
and
from
the
end
of
the
last
century
until
now
it
has
i
believe
been
used
exclusively
as
the
denotation
of
spirits
of
wine
and
bodies
chemically
allied
to
that
substance
the
process
which
gives
rise
to
alcohol
in
a
saccharine
fluid
is
known
tones
as
fermentation
a
term
based
upon
the
apparent
boiling
up
or
effervescence
of
the
fermenting
liquid
and
of
latin
origin
our
teutonic
cousins
call
the
same
process
gähren
gäsen
göschen
and
gischen
but
oddly
enough
we
do
not
seem
to
have
retained
their
verb
or
their
substantive
denoting
the
action
itself
though
we
do
use
names
identical
with
or
plainly
derived
from
theirs
for
the
scum
and
lees
these
are
called
in
low
german
gäscht
and
gischt
in
saxon
gest
gist
and
yst
whence
our
yeast
again
in
low
german
and
in
there
is
another
name
for
yeast
having
the
form
barm
or
beorm
and
in
the
midland
counties
barm
is
the
name
by
which
yeast
is
still
best
known
in
high
german
there
is
a
third
name
for
yeast
hefe
which
is
not
represented
in
english
so
far
as
i
know
all
these
words
are
said
by
philologers
to
be
derived
from
roots
expressive
of
the
intestine
motion
of
a
fermenting
substance
thus
hefe
is
derived
from
heben
to
raise
barm
from
beren
or
bären
to
bear
up
yeast
yst
and
gist
have
all
to
do
with
seething
and
foam
with
yeasty
waves
and
gusty
breezes
the
same
reference
to
the
swelling
up
of
the
fermenting
substance
is
seen
in
the
terms
levure
and
leaven
it
is
highly
creditable
to
the
ingenuity
of
our
ancestors
that
the
peculiar
property
of
fermented
liquids
in
virtue
of
which
they
make
glad
the
heart
of
man
seems
to
have
been
known
in
the
remotest
periods
of
which
we
have
any
record
all
savages
take
to
alcoholic
fluids
as
if
they
were
to
the
manner
born
our
vedic
forefathers
intoxicated
themselves
with
the
juice
of
the
soma
noah
by
a
not
unnatural
reaction
against
a
superfluity
of
water
appears
to
have
taken
the
earliest
practicable
opportunity
of
qualifying
that
which
he
was
obliged
to
drink
and
the
ghosts
of
the
ancient
egyptians
were
solaced
by
pictures
of
banquets
in
which
the
passes
round
graven
on
the
walls
of
their
tombs
a
knowledge
of
the
process
of
fermentation
therefore
was
in
all
probability
possessed
by
the
prehistoric
populations
of
the
globe
and
it
must
have
become
a
matter
of
great
interest
even
to
primaeval
to
study
the
methods
by
which
fermented
liquids
could
be
surely
manufactured
no
doubt
it
was
soon
discovered
that
the
most
certain
as
well
as
the
most
expeditious
way
of
making
a
sweet
juice
ferment
was
to
add
to
it
a
little
of
the
scum
or
lees
of
another
fermenting
juice
and
it
can
hardly
be
questioned
that
this
singular
excitation
of
fermentation
in
one
fluid
by
a
sort
of
infection
or
inoculation
of
a
little
ferment
taken
from
some
other
fluid
together
with
the
strange
swelling
foaming
and
hissing
of
the
fermented
substance
must
have
always
attracted
attention
from
the
more
thoughtful
nevertheless
the
commencement
of
the
scientific
analysis
of
the
phenomena
dates
from
a
period
not
earlier
than
the
first
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
at
this
time
van
helmont
made
a
first
step
by
pointing
out
that
the
peculiar
hissing
and
bubbling
of
a
fermented
liquid
is
due
not
to
the
evolution
of
common
air
which
he
as
the
inventor
of
the
term
gas
calls
gas
ventosum
but
to
that
of
a
peculiar
kind
of
air
such
as
is
occasionally
met
with
in
caves
mines
and
wells
and
which
he
calls
gas
sylvestre
but
a
century
elapsed
before
the
nature
of
this
gas
sylvestre
or
as
it
was
afterwards
called
fixed
air
was
clearly
determined
and
it
was
found
to
be
identical
with
that
deadly
by
which
the
lives
of
those
who
descend
into
old
wells
or
mines
or
brewers
vats
are
sometimes
suddenly
ended
and
with
the
poisonous
aëriform
fluid
which
is
produced
by
the
combustion
of
charcoal
and
now
goes
by
the
name
of
carbonic
acid
gas
during
the
same
time
it
gradually
became
evident
that
the
presence
of
sugar
was
essential
to
the
production
of
alcohol
and
the
evolution
of
carbonic
acid
gas
which
are
the
two
great
and
conspicuous
products
of
fermentation
and
finally
in
the
italian
chemist
fabroni
made
the
capital
discovery
that
the
yeast
ferment
the
presence
of
which
is
necessary
to
fermentation
is
what
he
termed
a
substance
that
is
a
body
which
gives
of
ammoniacal
salts
when
it
is
burned
and
is
in
other
ways
similar
to
the
gluten
of
plants
and
the
albumen
and
casein
of
animals
these
discoveries
prepared
the
way
for
the
illustrious
frenchman
lavoisier
who
first
approached
the
problem
of
fermentation
with
a
complete
conception
of
the
nature
of
the
work
to
be
done
the
words
in
which
he
expresses
this
conception
in
the
treatise
on
elementary
chemistry
to
which
reference
has
already
been
made
mark
the
year
as
the
commencement
of
a
revolution
of
not
less
moment
in
the
world
of
science
than
that
which
simultaneously
burst
over
the
political
world
and
soon
engulfed
lavoisier
himself
in
one
of
its
mad
eddies
we
may
lay
it
down
as
an
incontestable
axiom
that
in
all
the
operations
of
art
and
nature
nothing
is
created
an
equal
quantity
of
matter
exists
both
before
and
after
the
experiment
the
quality
and
quantity
of
the
elements
remain
precisely
the
same
and
nothing
takes
place
beyond
changes
and
modifications
in
the
combinations
of
these
elements
upon
this
principle
the
whole
art
of
performing
chemical
experiments
depends
we
must
always
suppose
an
exact
equality
between
the
elements
of
the
body
examined
and
those
of
the
products
of
its
analysis
hence
since
from
must
of
grapes
we
procure
alcohol
and
carbonic
acid
i
have
an
undoubted
right
to
suppose
that
must
consists
of
carbonic
acid
and
alcohol
from
these
premisses
we
have
two
modes
of
ascertaining
what
passes
during
vinous
fermentation
either
by
determining
the
nature
of
and
the
elements
which
compose
the
fermentable
substances
or
by
accurately
examining
the
products
resulting
from
fermentation
and
it
is
evident
that
the
knowledge
of
either
of
these
must
lead
to
accurate
conclusions
concerning
the
nature
and
composition
of
the
other
from
these
considerations
it
became
necessary
accurately
to
determine
the
constituent
elements
of
the
fermentable
substances
and
for
this
purpose
i
did
not
make
use
of
the
compound
juices
of
fruits
the
rigorous
analysis
of
which
is
perhaps
impossible
but
made
choice
of
sugar
which
is
easily
analysed
and
the
nature
of
which
i
have
already
explained
this
substance
is
a
true
vegetable
oxyd
with
two
bases
composed
of
hydrogen
and
carbon
brought
to
the
state
of
an
oxyd
by
means
of
a
certain
proportion
of
oxygen
and
these
three
elements
are
combined
in
such
a
way
that
a
very
slight
force
is
sufficient
to
destroy
the
equilibrium
of
their
connection
after
giving
the
details
of
his
analysis
of
sugar
and
of
the
products
of
fermentation
lavoisier
continues
the
effect
of
the
vinous
fermentation
upon
sugar
is
thus
reduced
to
the
mere
separation
of
its
elements
into
two
portions
one
part
is
oxygenated
at
the
expense
of
the
other
so
as
to
form
carbonic
acid
while
the
other
part
being
disoxygenated
in
favour
of
the
latter
is
converted
into
the
combustible
substance
called
alkohol
therefore
if
it
were
possible
to
alkohol
and
carbonic
acid
together
we
ought
to
form
sugar
footnote
of
by
lavoisier
translated
by
robert
kerr
second
edition
pp
thus
lavoisier
thought
he
had
demonstrated
that
the
carbonic
acid
and
the
alcohol
which
are
produced
by
the
process
of
fermentation
are
equal
in
weight
to
the
sugar
which
disappears
but
the
application
of
the
more
refined
methods
of
modern
chemistry
to
the
investigation
of
the
products
of
fermentation
by
pasteur
in
proved
that
this
is
not
exactly
true
and
that
there
is
a
deficit
of
from
to
per
cent
of
the
sugar
which
is
not
covered
by
the
alcohol
and
carbonic
acid
evolved
the
greater
part
of
this
deficit
is
accounted
for
by
the
discovery
of
two
substances
glycerine
and
succinic
acid
of
the
existence
of
which
lavoisier
was
unaware
in
the
fermented
liquid
but
about
per
cent
still
remains
to
be
made
good
according
to
pasteur
it
has
been
appropriated
by
the
yeast
but
the
fact
that
such
appropriation
takes
place
can
not
be
said
to
be
actually
proved
however
this
may
be
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
constituent
elements
of
fully
per
cent
of
the
sugar
which
has
vanished
during
fermentation
have
simply
undergone
rearrangement
like
the
soldiers
of
a
brigade
who
at
the
word
of
command
divide
themselves
into
the
independent
regiments
to
which
they
belong
the
brigade
is
sugar
the
regiments
are
carbonic
acid
succinic
acid
alcohol
and
glycerine
from
the
time
of
fabroni
onwards
it
has
been
admitted
that
the
agent
by
which
this
surprising
rearrangement
of
the
particles
of
the
sugar
is
effected
is
the
yeast
but
the
first
thoroughly
conclusive
evidence
of
the
necessity
of
yeast
for
the
fermentation
of
sugar
was
furnished
by
appert
whose
method
of
preserving
perishable
articles
of
food
excited
so
much
attention
in
france
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
in
his
mémoire
sur
la
fermentation
alludes
to
appert
method
of
preserving
unfermented
for
an
indefinite
time
by
simply
boiling
the
wort
and
closing
the
vessel
in
which
the
boiling
fluid
is
contained
in
such
a
way
as
thoroughly
to
exclude
air
and
he
shows
that
if
a
little
yeast
be
introduced
into
such
wort
after
it
has
cooled
the
wort
at
once
begins
to
ferment
even
though
every
precaution
be
taken
to
exclude
air
and
this
statement
has
since
received
full
confirmation
from
pasteur
footnote
de
on
the
other
hand
schwann
schroeder
and
dutch
and
pasteur
have
amply
proved
that
air
may
be
allowed
to
have
free
access
to
without
exciting
fermentation
if
only
efficient
precautions
are
taken
to
prevent
the
entry
of
particles
of
yeast
along
with
the
air
thus
the
truth
that
the
fermentation
of
a
simple
solution
of
sugar
in
water
depends
upon
the
presence
of
yeast
rests
upon
an
unassailable
foundation
and
the
inquiry
into
the
exact
nature
of
the
substance
which
possesses
such
a
wonderful
chemical
influence
becomes
profoundly
interesting
the
first
step
towards
the
solution
of
this
problem
was
made
two
centuries
ago
by
the
patient
and
painstaking
dutch
naturalist
leeuwenhoek
who
in

at

of
his

the

full

satisfactory
investigation
the
main
conclusions
at
which
they
arrived
are
these
the
globular
or
oval
corpuscles
which
float
so
thickly
in
the
yeast
as
to
make
it

the

great
rapidity
by
giving
off
minute

soon
attain
the

of
their
parent

then
either
become
detached
or
remain
united
forming
the
compound
globules
of
which
leeuwenhoek
speaks
though
the
constancy
of
their
arrangement
in
sixes
existed
only
in
the
worthy
dutchman
imagination
it
was
very
soon
made
out
that
these
yeast
organisms
to
which
turpin
gave
the
name
of
were
more
nearly
allied
to
the
lower
fungi
than
to
anything
else
indeed
turpin
and
subsequently
berkeley
and
hoffmann
believed
that
they
had
traced
the
development
of
the
into
the
and
very
common
mould
the
other
observers
have
not
succeeded
in
verifying
these
statements
and
my
own
observations
lead
me
to
believe
that
while
the
connection
between
and
the
moulds
is
a
very
close
one
it
is
of
a
different
nature
from
that
which
has
been
supposed
i
have
never
been
able
to
trace
the
development
of
into
a
true
mould
but
it
is
quite
easy
to
prove
that
species
of
true
mould
such
as
when
sown
in
an
appropriate
nidus
such
as
a
solution
of
tartrate
of
ammonia
and
in
water
with
or
without
sugar
give
rise
to
similar
in
all
respects
to
except
that
they
are
on
the
average
smaller
moreover
bail
has
observed
the
development
of
a
larger
than
from
a
a
mould
allied
to
it
follows
therefore
that
the
or
organisms
of
yeast
are
veritable
plants
and
conclusive
experiments
have
proved
that
the
power
which
causes
the
rearrangement
of
the
molecules
of
the
sugar
is
intimately
connected
with
the
life
and
growth
of
the
plant
in
fact
whatever
arrests
the
vital
activity
of
the
plant
also
prevents
it
from
exciting
fermentation
such
being
the
facts
with
regard
to
the
nature
of
yeast
and
the
changes
which
it
effects
in
sugar
how
are
they
to
be
accounted
for
before
modern
chemistry
had
come
into
existence
stahl
stumbling
with
the
stride
of
genius
upon
the
conception
which
lies
at
the
bottom
of
all
modern
views
of
the
process
put
forward
the
notion
that
the
ferment
being
in
a
state
of
internal
motion
communicated
that
motion
to
the
sugar
and
thus
caused
its
resolution
into
new
substances
and
lavoisier
as
we
have
seen
adopts
substantially
the
same
view
but
fabroni
full
of
the
then
novel
conception
of
acids
and
bases
and
double
decompositions
propounded
the
hypothesis
that
sugar
is
an
oxide
with
two
bases
and
the
ferment
a
carbonate
with
two
bases
that
the
carbon
of
the
ferment
unites
with
the
oxygen
of
the
sugar
and
gives
rise
to
carbonic
acid
while
the
sugar
uniting
with
the
nitrogen
of
the
ferment
produces
a
new
substance
analogous
to
opium
this
is
decomposed
by
distillation
and
gives
rise
to
alcohol
next
in
thénard
propounded
a
hypothesis
which
partakes
somewhat
of
the
nature
of
both
stahl
and
fabroni
views
i
do
not
believe
with
lavoisier
he
says
that
all
the
carbonic
acid
formed
proceeds
from
the
sugar
how
in
that
case
could
we
conceive
the
action
of
the
ferment
on
it
i
think
that
the
first
portions
of
the
acid
are
due
to
a
combination
of
the
carbon
of
the
ferment
with
the
oxygen
of
the
sugar
and
that
it
is
by
carrying
off
a
portion
of
oxygen
from
the
last
that
the
ferment
causes
the
fermentation
to
commence
the
equilibrium
between
the
principles
of
the
sugar
being
disturbed
they
combine
afresh
to
form
carbonic
acid
and
alcohol
the
three
views
here
before
us
may
be
familiarly
exemplified
by
supposing
the
sugar
to
be
a
according
to
stahl
the
ferment
is
somebody
who
knocks
the
table
and
shakes
the
down
according
to
fabroni
the
ferment
takes
out
some
cards
but
puts
others
in
their
places
according
to
thénard
the
ferment
simply
takes
a
card
out
of
the
bottom
story
the
result
of
which
is
that
all
the
others
fall
as
chemistry
advanced
facts
came
to
light
which
put
a
new
face
upon
stahl
hypothesis
and
gave
it
a
safer
foundation
than
it
previously
possessed
the
general
nature
of
these
phenomena
may
be
thus
stated
a
body
a
without
giving

or
taking
from
another
body
b
any
material

causes
b
to
decompose
into
other
substances
c
d
e
the
sum
of
the
weights
of
which
is
equal
to
the
weight
of
b
which
decomposes
thus
bitter
almonds
contain
two
substances
amygdalin
and
synaptase
which
can
be
extracted
in
a
separate
state
from
the
bitter
almonds
the
amygdalin
thus
obtained
if
dissolved
in
water
undergoes
no
change
but
if
a
little
synaptase
be
added
to
the
solution
the
amygdalin
splits
up
into
bitter
almond
oil
prussic
acid
and
a
kind
of
sugar
a
short
time
after
cagniard
de
la

discovered
the
yeast
plant
liebig
struck
with
the
similarity
between
this
and
other
such
processes
and
the
fermentation
of
sugar
put
forward
the
hypothesis
that
yeast
contains
a
substance
which
acts
upon
sugar
as
synaptase
acts
upon
amygdalin
and
as
the
synaptase
is
certainly
neither
organized
nor
alive
but
a
mere
chemical
substance
liebig
treated
cagniard
de
la
discovery
with
no
small
contempt
and
from
that
time
to
the
present
has
steadily
repudiated
the
notion
that
the
decomposition
of
the
sugar
is
in
any
sense
the
result
of
the
vital
activity
of
the
but
though
the
notion
that
the
is
a
creature
which
eats
sugar
and
excretes

acid

alcohol

is
not
unjustly
ridiculed
in
the
most
surprising
paper
that
ever
made
its
appearance
in
a
grave
scientific
journal
may
be
untenable
the
fact
that
the
are
alive
and
that
yeast
does
not
excite
fermentation
unless
it
contains
living
stands
fast
moreover
of
late
years
the
essential
participation
of
living
organisms
in
fermentation
other
than
the
alcoholic
has
been
clearly
made
out

is
at

but
without
presuming
to

which
leads
us
into
the
very
arcana
of
chemistry
the
present
state
of
speculation
upon
the
of
the
yeast
plant
in
producing
fermentation
is
represented
on
the
one
hand
by
the
stahlian
doctrine
supported
by
liebig
according
to
which
the
atoms
of
the
sugar
are
shaken
into
new
combinations
either
directly
by
the
or
indirectly
by
some
substance
formed
by
them
and
on
the
other
hand
by
the
thénardian
doctrine
supported
by
pasteur
according
to
which
the
yeast
plant
assimilates
part
of
the
sugar
and
in
so
doing
disturbs
the
rest
and
determines
its
resolution
into
the
products
of
fermentation
perhaps
the
two
views
are
not
so
much
opposed
as
they
seem
at
first
sight
to
be
but
the
interest
which
attaches
to
the
influence
of
the
yeast
plants
upon
the
medium
in
which
they
live
and
grow
does
not
arise
solely
from
its
bearing
upon
the
theory
of
fermentation
so
long
ago
as
turpin
compared

almost
at
the

time
and
probably
equally
guided
by
his
study
of
yeast
schwann
was
engaged
in
those
remarkable
investigations
into
the
form
and
development
of
the
ultimate
structural
elements
of
the
tissues
of
animals
which
led
him
to
recognise
their
fundamental
identity
with
the
ultimate
structural
elements
of
vegetable
organisms
the
yeast
plant
is
a
mere
sac
or
cell
containing
a
matter
and
schwann
microscopic
analysis
resolved
all
living
organisms
in
the
long
run
into
an
aggregation
of
such
sacs
or
cells
variously
modified
and
tended
to
show
that
all
whatever
their
ultimate
complication
begin
their
existence
in
the
condition
of
such
simple
cells
in
his
famous
mikroskopische

schwann
speaks
of
as
a
cell
and
in
a
remarkable
note
to
the
passage
in
which
he
refers
to
the
yeast
plant
schwann
says
i
have
been
unable
to
avoid
mentioning
fermentation
because
it
is
the
most
fully
and
exactly
known
operation
of
cells
and
represents
in
the
simplest
fashion
the
process
which
is
repeated
by
every
cell
of
the
living
body
in
other
words
schwann
conceives
that
every
cell
of
the
living
body
exerts
an
influence
on
the
matter
which
surrounds
and
permeates
it
analogous
to
that
which
a
exerts
on
the
saccharine
solution
by
which
it
is
bathed
a
wonderfully
suggestive
thought
opening
up
views
of
the
nature
of
the
chemical
processes
of
the
living
body
which
have
hardly
yet
received
all
the
development
of
which
they
are
capable
kant
defined
the
special
peculiarity
of
the
living
body
to
be
that
the
parts
exist
for
the
sake
of
the
whole
and
the
whole
for
the
sake
of
the
parts
but
when
turpin
and
schwann
resolved
the
living
body
into
an
aggregation
of
cells
each
like
a
leading
its
own
life
and
having
its
own
laws
of
growth
and
development
the
aggregation
being
dominated
and
kept
working
towards
a
definite
end
only
by
a
certain
harmony
among
these
units
or
by
the
superaddition
of
a
controlling
apparatus
such
as
a
nervous
system
this
conception
ceased
to
be
tenable
the
cell
lives
for
its
own
sake
as
well
as
for
the
sake
of
the
whole
organism
and
the
cells
which
float
in
the
blood
live
at
its
expense
and
profoundly
modify
it
are
almost
as
much
independent
organisms
as
the
which
float
in
schwann
burdened
his
enunciation
of
the
cell
theory
with
two
false
suppositions
the
one
that
the
structures
he
called
nucleus
and
are
essential
to
a
cell
the
other
that
cells
are
usually
formed
independently
of
other
cells
but
in
it
was
a
vast
and
clear
gain
to
arrive
at
the
conception
that
the
vital
functions
of
all
the
higher
animals
and
plants
are
the
resultant
of
the
forces
inherent
in
the
innumerable
minute
cells
of
which
they
are
composed
and
that
each
of
them
is
itself
an
equivalent
of
one
of
the
lowest
and
simplest
of
independent
living
beings
the
footnote
later
investigations
have
thrown
an
entirely
new
light
upon
the
structure
and
the
functional
importance
of
the
nucleus
and
have
proved
that
schwann
did
not
its
importance

purely
morphological
investigations

schwann

we
have

at
the
notion
of
the
fundamental
unity

led
up
to
the
conception

the
fundamental

composition
so
far
back

from

in
this
that
in

the

a

rare

a

i
suppose
this
would
have
been
a
recurrence
to
the
base
philosophy
of
the
eighteenth
century
which
liked
to

before
it

and
to
understand
before
it
criticised

winds
up
his
paper
with
the
following
paragraph
footnote
subsequently
published
under
the
title
of
as
regards
protoplasm
in
short
the
whole
position
of
huxley
that
all
organisms
consist
alike
of
the
same
which
is
for
its
part
due
only
to

must
be
pronounced
untenable
nor
less
untenable
the

the

three
distinct
assertions
concerning
my
views
and
just
the
same
number
of
utter
misrepresentations
of
them
that
which
i
have
numbered
turns
on
the
ambiguity
of
the
word

for
a
discussion
of
which
i
would
refer
stirling
to
a
great
hero
of
archbishop
whately
statement
number
is
in
my
judgment
absurd
and
certainly
i
have
never
said
anything
resembling
it
while
as
to
number
one
great
object
of
my
essay
was
to
show
that
what
is
called
materialism
has
no
sound
philosophical
basis
as
we
have
seen
the
study
of
yeast
has
led
investigators
face
to
face
with
problems
of
immense
interest
in
pure
chemistry
and
in
animal
and
vegetable
morphology
its
physiology
is
not
less
rich
in
subjects
for
inquiry
take
for
example
the
singular
fact
that
yeast
will
increase
indefinitely
when
grown
in
the
dark
in
water
containing
only
tartrate
of
ammonia
a
small
percentage
of
mineral
salts
and
sugar
out
of
these
materials
the
will
manufacture
nitrogenous
protoplasm
cellulose
and
fatty
matters
in
any
quantity
although
they
are
wholly
deprived
of
those
rays
of
the
sun
the
influence
of
which
is
essential
to
the
growth
of
ordinary
plants
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
speculation
lately
as
to
how
the
living
organisms
buried
beneath
two
or
three
thousand
fathoms
of
water
and
therefore
in
all
probability
almost
deprived
of
light
live
if
any
of
them
possess
the
same
powers
as
yeast
and
the
same
capacity
for
living
without
light
is
exhibited
by
some
other
fungi
there
would
seem
to
be
no
difficulty
about
the
matter
of
the
pathological
bearings
of
the
study
of
yeast
and
other
such
organisms
i
have
spoken
elsewhere
it
is
certain
that
in
some
animals
devastating
epidemics
are
caused
by
fungi
of
low
order
similar
to
those
of
which
is
a
sort
of
offshoot
it
is
certain
that
such
diseases
are
propagated
by
contagion
and
infection
in
just
the
same
way
as
ordinary
contagious
and
infectious
diseases
are
propagated
of
course
it
does
not
follow
from
this
that
all
contagious
and
infectious
diseases
are
caused
by
organisms
of
as
definite
and
independent
a
character
as
the
but
i
think
it
does
follow
that
it
is
prudent
and
wise
to
satisfy
one
self
in
each
particular
case
that
the
germ
theory
can
not
and
will
not
explain
the
facts
before
having
recourse
to
hypotheses
which
have
no
equal
support
from
analogy
v
on
the
formation
of
coal
the
lumps
of
coal
in
a
very
often
have
a
roughly
cubical
form
if
one
of
them
be
picked
out
and
examined
with
a
little
care
it
will
be
found
that
its
six
sides
are
not
exactly
alike
two
opposite
sides
are
comparatively
smooth
and
shining
while
the
other
four
are
much
rougher
and
are
marked
by
lines
which
run
parallel
with
the
smooth
sides
the
coal
readily
splits
along
these
lines
and
the
split
surfaces
thus
formed
are
parallel
with
the
smooth
faces
in
other
words
there
is
a
sort
of
rough
and
incomplete
stratification
in
the
lump
of
coal
as
if
it
were
a
book
the
leaves
of
which
had
stuck
together
very
closely
sometimes
the
faces
along
which
the
coal
splits
are
not
smooth
but
exhibit
a
thin
layer
of
dull
substance
which
is
known
as
mineral
charcoal
occasionally
one
of
the
faces
of
a
lump
of
coal
will
present
impressions
which
are
obviously
those
of
the
stem
or
leaves
of
a
plant
but
though
hard
mineral
masses
of
pyrites
and
even
fine
mud
may
occur
here
and
there
neither
sand
nor
pebbles
are
met
with
when
the
coal
burns
the
chief
ultimate
products
of
its
combustion
are
carbonic
acid
water
and
ammoniacal
products
which
escape
up
the
chimney
and
a
greater
or
less
amount
of
residual
earthy
salts
which
take
the
form
of
ash
these
products
are
to
a
great
extent
such
as
would
result
from
the
burning
of
so
much
wood
these
properties
of
coal
may
be
made
out
without
any
very
refined
appliances
but
the
microscope
reveals
something
more
black
and
opaque
as
ordinary
coal
is
slices
of
it
become
transparent
if
they
are
cemented
in
canada
balsam
and
rubbed
down
very
thin
in
the
ordinary
way
of
making
thin
sections
of
bodies
but
as
the
thin
slices
made
in
this
way
are
very
apt
to
crack
and
break
into
fragments
it
is
better
to
employ
marine
glue
as
the
cementing
material
by
the
use
of
this
substance
slices
of
considerable
size
and
of
extreme
thinness
and
transparency
may
be
obtained
footnote
my
assistant
in
the
museum
of
practical
geology
newton
invented
this
excellent
method
of
obtaining
thin
slices
of
coal
now
let
us
suppose
two
such
slices
to
be
prepared
from
our
lump
of
coal
one
parallel
with
the
bedding
the
other
perpendicular
to
it
and
let
us
call
the
one
the
horizontal
and
the
other
the
vertical
section
the
horizontal
section
will
present
more
or
less
rounded
yellow
patches
and
streaks
scattered
irregularly
through
the
dark
brown
or
blackish
ground
substance
while
the
vertical
section
will
exhibit
mere
elongated
bars
and
granules
of
the
same
yellow
materials
disposed
in
lines
which
correspond
roughly
with
the
general
direction
of
the
bedding
of
the
coal
this
is
the
microscopic
structure
of
an
ordinary
piece
of
coal
but
if
a
great
series
of
coals
from
different
localities
and
seams
or
even
from
different
parts
of
the
same
seam
be
examined
this
structure
will
be
found
to
vary
in
two
directions
in
the
anthracitic
or
which
burn
like
coke
the
yellow
matter
diminishes
and
the
ground
substance
becomes
more
predominant
blacker
and
more
opaque
until
it
becomes
impossible
to
grind
a
section
thin
enough
to
be
translucent
while
on
the
other
hand
in
such
as
the
coal
of
the
neighbourhood
of
bradford
which
burns
with
much
flame
the
coal
is
of
a
far
lighter
colour
and
transparent
sections
are
very
easily
obtained
in
the
browner
parts
of
this
coal
sharp
eyes
will
readily
detect
multitudes
of
curious
little
bodies
of
a
yellowish
brown
colour
embedded
in
the
dark
brown
ground
substance
on
the
average
these
little
brown
bodies
may
have
a
diameter
of
about
of
an
inch
they
lie
with
their
flat
surfaces
nearly
parallel
with
the
two
smooth
faces
of
the
block
in
which
they
are
contained
and
on
one
side
of
each
there
may
be
discerned
a
figure
consisting
of
three
straight
linear
marks
which
radiate
from
the
centre
of
the
disk
but
do
not
quite
reach
its
circumference
in
the
horizontal
section
these
disks
are
often
converted
into
more
or
less
complete
rings
while
in
the
vertical
sections
they
appear
like
thick
hoops
the
sides
of
which
have
been
pressed
together
the
disks
are
therefore
flattened
bags
and
favourable
sections
show
that
the
marking
is
the
expression
of
three
clefts
which
penetrate
one
wall
of
the
bag
the
sides
of
the
bags
are
sometimes
closely
approximated
but
when
the
bags
are
less
flattened
their
cavities
are
usually
filled
with
numerous
irregularly
rounded
hollow
bodies
having
the
same
kind
of
wall
as
the
large
ones
but
not
more
than
one
of
an
inch
in
diameter
in
favourable
specimens
again
almost
the
whole
ground
substance
appears
to
be
made
up
of
similar
bodies
more
or
less
carbonized
or
blackened
and
in
these
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
with
the
exception
of
patches
of
mineral
charcoal
here
and
there
the
whole
mass
of
the
coal
is
made
up
of
an
accumulation
of
the
larger
and
of
the
smaller
sacs
but
in
one
and
the
same
slice
every
transition
can
be
observed
from
this
structure
to
that
which
has
been
described
as
characteristic
of
ordinary
coal
the
latter
appears
to
rise
out
of
the
former
by
the
and
increasing
carbonization
of
the
larger
and
the
smaller
sacs
and
in
the
anthracitic
coals
this
process
appears
to
have
gone
to
such
a
length
as
to
destroy
the
original
structure
altogether
and
to
replace
it
by
a
completely
carbonized
substance
thus
coal
may
be
said
speaking
broadly
to
be
composed
of
two
constituents
firstly
mineral
charcoal
and
secondly
coal
proper
the
nature
of
the
mineral
charcoal
has
long
since
been
determined
its
structure
shows
it
to
consist
of
the
remains
of
the
stems
and
leaves
of
plants
reduced
a
little
more
than
their
carbon
again
some
of
the
coal
is
made
up
of
the
crushed
and
flattened
bark
or
outer
coat
of
the
stems
of
plants
the
inner
wood
of
which
has
completely
decayed
away
but
what
i
may
term
the
saccular
matter
of
the
coal
which
either
in
its
primary
or
in
its
degraded
form
constitutes
by
far
the
greater
part
of
all
the
bituminous
coals
i
have
examined
is
certainly
not
mineral
charcoal
nor
is
its
structure
that
of
any
stem
or
leaf
hence
its
real
nature
is
at
first
by
no
means
apparent
and
has
been
the
subject
of
much
discussion
the
first
person
who
threw
any
light
upon
the
problem
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
discover
was
the
geologist
professor
morris
it
is
now
years
since
he
carefully
described
and
figured
the
bodies
or
larger
sacs
as
i
have
called
them
in
a
note
appended
to
the
famous
paper
on
the
coalbrookdale
published
at
that
time
by
the
present
president
of
the
geological
society
prestwich
with
much
sagacity
professor
morris
divined
the
real
nature
of
these
bodies
and
boldly
affirmed
them
to
be
the
of
a
plant
allied
to
the
living
but
discovery
sometimes
makes
a
long
halt
and
it
is
only
a
few
years
since
carruthers
determined
the
plant
or
rather
one
of
the
plants
which
produces
these
by
finding
the
discoidal
sacs
still
adherent
to
the
leaves
of
the
fossilized
cone
which
produced
them
he
gave
the
name
of
to
the
plant
of
which
the
cones
form
a
part
the
branches
and
stem
of
this
plant
are
not
yet
certainly
known
but
there
is
no
sort
of
doubt
that
it
was
closely
allied
to
the
the
remains
of
which
abound
in
the
coal
formation
the
were
shrubs
and
trees
which
put
one
more
in
mind
of
an
than
of
any
other
familiar
plant
and
the
ends
of
the
fruiting
branches
were
terminated
by
cones
or
catkins
somewhat
like
the
bodies
so
named
in
a
fir
or
a
willow
these
conical
fruits
however
did
not
produce
seeds
but
the
leaves
of
which
they
were
composed
bore
upon
their
surfaces
sacs
full
of
spores
or
sporangia
such
as
those
one
sees
on
the
under
surface
of
a
bracken
leaf
now
it
is
these
sporangia
of
the
lepidodendroid
plant
which
were
identified
by
carruthers
with
the
free
sporangia
described
by
professor
morris
which
are
the
same
as
the
large
sacs
of
which
i
have
spoken
and
more
than
this
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
small
sacs
are
the
spores
which
were
originally
contained
in
the
sporangia
the
living
are
for
the
most
part
insignificant
and
creeping
herbs
which
superficially
very
closely
resemble
true
mosses
and
none
of
them
reach
more
than
two
or
three
feet
in
height
but
in
their
essential
structure
they
very
closely
resemble
the
earliest
lepidodendroid
trees
of
the
coal
their
stems
and
leaves
are
similar
so
are
their
cones
and
no
less
like
are
the
sporangia
and
spores
while
even
in
their
size
the
spores
of
the
and
those
of
the
existing
or
very
closely
approach
one
another
thus
the
singular
conclusion
is
forced
upon
us
that
the
greater
and
the
smaller
sacs
of
the
and
other
coals
in
which
the
primitive
structure
is
well
preserved
are
simply
the
sporangia
and
spores
of
certain
plants
many
of
which
were
closely
allied
to
the
existing
mosses
and
if
as
i
believe
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
ordinary
coal
is
nothing
but
saccular
coal
which
has
undergone
a
certain
amount
of
that
alteration
which
if
continued
would
convert
it
into
anthracite
then
the
conclusion
is
obvious
that
the
great
mass
of
the
coal
we
burn
is
the
result
of
the
accumulation
of
the
spores
and
of
plants
other
parts
of
which
have
furnished
the
carbonized
stems
and
the
mineral
charcoal
or
have
left
their
impressions
on
the
surfaces
of
the
layer
of
the
multitudinous
speculations
which
at
various
times
have
been
entertained
respecting
the
origin
and
mode
of
formation
of
coal
several
appear
to
be
negatived
and
put
out
of
court
by
the
structural
facts
the
significance
of
which
i
have
endeavoured
to
explain
these
facts
for
example
do
not
permit
us
to
suppose
that
coal
is
an
accumulation
of
peaty
matter
as
some
have
held
again
the
late
professor
quekett
was
one
of
the
first
observers
who
gave
a
correct
description
of
what
i
have
termed
the
saccular
structure
of
coal
and
rightly
perceiving
that
this
structure
was
something
quite
different
from
that
of
any
known
plant
he
imagined
that
it
proceeded
from
some
extinct
vegetable
organism
which
was
peculiarly
abundant
amongst
the
plants
but
this
explanation
is
at
once
shown
to
be
untenable
when
the
smaller
and
the
larger
sacs
are
proved
to
be
spores
or
sporangia
some
once
more
have
imagined
that
coal
was
of
submarine
origin
and
though
the
notion
is
amply
and
easily
refuted
by
other
considerations
it
may
be
worth
while
to
remark
that
it
is
impossible
to
comprehend
how
a
mass
of
light
and
resinous
spores
should
have
reached
the
bottom
of
the
sea
or
should
have
stopped
in
that
position
if
they
had
got
there
at
the
same
time
it
is
proper
to
remark
that
i
do
not
presume
to
suggest
that
all
coal
must
needs
have
the
same
structure
or
that
there
may
not
be
coals
in
which
the
proportions
of
wood
and
spores
or
are
very
different
from
those
which
i
have
examined
all
i
repeat
is
that
none
of
the
coals
which
have
come
under
my
notice
have
enabled
me
to
observe
such
a
difference
but
according
to
principal
dawson
who
has
so
sedulously
examined
the
fossil
remains
of
plants
in
north
america
it
is
otherwise
with
the
vast
accumulations
of
coal
in
that
country
the
true
coal
says
dawson
consists
principally
of
the
flattened
bark
of
sigillarioid
and
other
trees
intermixed
with
leaves
of
ferns
and
and
other
herbaceous
and
with
fragments
of
decayed
wood
constituting
charcoal
all
these
materials
having
manifestly
alike
grown
and
accumulated
where
we
find
them
footnote
edition
p
when
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
principal
dawson
in
london
last
summer
i
showed
him
my
sections
of
coal
and
begged
him
to
some
of
the
american
coals
on
his
return
to
canada
with
an
eye
to
the
presence
of
spores
and
sporangia
such
as
i
was
able
to
show
him
in
our
english
and
scotch
coals
he
has
been
good
enough
to
do
so
and
in
a
letter
dated
september
he
informs
me
that
indications
of
are
rare
except
in
certain
coarse
shaly
coals
and
portions
of
coals
and
in
the
roofs
of
the
seams
the
most
marked
case
i
have
yet
met
with
is
the
shaly
coal
referred
to
as
containing
in
my
paper
on
the
conditions
of
accumulation
of
coal
journal
of
the
geological
society
vol
xxii
pp
and
the
purer
coals
certainly
consist
principally
of
cubical
tissues
with
some
true
woody
matter
and
the
are
chiefly
in
the
coarse
and
shaly
layers
this
is
my
old
doctrine
in
my
two
papers
in
the
journal
of
the
geological
society
and
i
see
nothing
to
modify
it
your
observations
however
make
it
probable
that
the
frequent
in
the
cannels
are
dawson
results
are
the
more
remarkable
as
the
numerous
specimens
of
british
coal
from
various
localities
which
i
have
examined
tell
one
tale
as
to
the
predominance
of
the
spore
and
sporangium
element
in
their
composition
and
as
it
is
exactly
in
the
finest
and
purest
coals
such
as
the
coal
of
lowmoor
that
the
spores
and
sporangia
obviously
constitute
almost
the
entire
mass
of
the
deposit
coal
such
as
that
which
has
been
described
is
always
found
in
sheets
or
seams
varying
from
a
fraction
of
an
inch
to
many
feet
in
thickness
enclosed
in
the
substance
of
the
earth
at
very
various
depths
between
beds
of
rock
of
different
kinds
as
a
rule
every
seam
of
coal
rests
upon
a
thicker
or
thinner
bed
of
clay
which
is
known
as
these
alternations
of
beds
of
coal
clay
and
rock
may
be
repeated
many
times
and
are
known
as
the
and
in
some
regions
as
in
south
wales
and
in
nova
scotia
the
attain
a
thickness
of
twelve
or
fourteen
thousand
feet
and
enclose
eighty
or
a
hundred
seams
of
coal
each
with
its
and
separated
from
those
above
and
below
by
beds
of
sandstone
and
shale
the
position
of
the
beds
which
constitute
the
is
infinitely
diverse
sometimes
they
are
tilted
up
vertically
sometimes
they
are
horizontal
sometimes
curved
into
great
basins
sometimes
they
come
to
the
surface
sometimes
they
are
covered
up
by
thousands
of
feet
of
rock
but
whatever
their
present
position
there
is
abundant
and
conclusive
evidence
that
every
was
once
a
surface
soil
not
only
do
carbonized
frequently
abound
in
these
but
the
stools
of
trees
the
trunks
of
which
are
broken
off
and
confounded
with
the
bed
of
coal
have
been
repeatedly
found
passing
into
radiating
roots
still
embedded
in
the
on
many
parts
of
the
coast
of
england
what
are
commonly
known
as
submarine
forests
are
to
be
seen
at
low
water
they
consist
for
the
most
part
of
short
stools
of
oak
beech
and
still
fixed
by
their
long
roots
in
the
bed
of
blue
clay
in
which
they
originally
grew
if
one
of
these
submarine
forest
beds
should
be
gradually
depressed
and
covered
up
by
new
deposits
it
would
present
just
the
same
characters
as
an
of
the
coal
if
the
and
of
the
ancient
world
were
substituted
for
the
oak
or
the
beech
of
our
own
times
in
a
tropical
forest
at
the
present
day
the
trunks
of
fallen
trees
and
the
stools
of
such
trees
as
may
have
been
broken
by
the
violence
of
storms
remain
entire
for
but
a
short
time
contrary
to
what
might
be
expected
the
dense
wood
of
the
tree
decays
and
suffers
from
the
ravages
of
insects
more
swiftly
than
the
bark
and
the
traveller
setting
his
foot
on
a
prostrate
trunk
finds
that
it
is
a
mere
shell
which
breaks
under
his
weight
and
lands
his
foot
amidst
the
insects
or
the
reptiles
which
have
sought
food
or
refuge
within
the
trees
of
the
coal
forests
present
parallel
conditions
when
the
fallen
trunks
which
have
entered
into
the
composition
of
the
bed
of
coal
are
identifiable
they
are
mere
double
shells
of
bark
flattened
together
in
consequence
of
the
destruction
of
the
woody
core
and
sir
charles
lyell
and
principal
dawson
discovered
in
the
hollow
stools
of
coal
trees
of
nova
scotia
the
remains
of
snails
millipedes
and
creatures
embedded
in
a
deposit
of
a
different
character
from
that
which
surrounded
the
exterior
of
the
trees
thus
in
endeavouring
to
comprehend
the
formation
of
a
seam
of
coal
we
must
try
to
picture
to
ourselves
a
thick
forest
formed
for
the
most
part
of
trees
like
gigantic
mosses
and
with
here
and
there
some
that
had
more
resemblance
to
our
existing
yews
and
we
must
suppose
that
as
the
seasons
rolled
by
the
plants
grew
and
developed
their
spores
and
seeds
that
they
shed
these
in
enormous
quantities
which
accumulated
on
the
ground
beneath
and
that
every
now
and
then
they
added
a
dead
frond
or
leaf
or
at
longer
intervals
a
rotten
branch
or
a
dead
trunk
to
the
mass
a
certain
proportion
of
the
spores
and
seeds
no
doubt
fulfilled
their
obvious
function
and
carried
by
the
wind
to
unoccupied
regions
extended
the
limits
of
the
forest
many
might
be
washed
away
by
rain
into
streams
and
be
lost
but
a
large
portion
must
have
remained
to
accumulate
like
or
acorns
beneath
the
trees
of
a
modern
forest
but
in
this
case
it
may
be
asked
why
does
not
our
english
coal
consist
of
stems
and
leaves
to
a
much
greater
extent
than
it
does
what
is
the
reason
of
the
predominance
of
the
spores
and
in
it
a
ready
answer
to
this
question
is
afforded
by
the
study
of
a
living
shake
it
upon
a
piece
of
paper
and
it
emits
a
cloud
of
fine
dust
which
falls
over
the
paper
and
is
the
lycopodium
powder
now
this
powder
used
to
be
and
i
believe
still
is
employed
for
two
objects
which
seem
at
first
sight
to
have
no
particular
connection
with
one
another
it
is
or
was
employed
in
making
lightning
and
in
making
pills
the
coats
of
the
spores
contain
so
much
resinous
matter
that
a
pinch
of
lycopodium
powder
thrown
through
the
flame
of
a
candle
burns
with
an
instantaneous
flash
which
has
long
done
duty
for
lightning
on
the
stage
and
the
same
character
makes
it
a
capital
coating
for
pills
for
the
resinous
powder
prevents
the
drug
from
being
wetted
by
the
saliva
and
thus
bars
the
nauseous
flavour
from
the
sensitive
papilla
of
the
tongue
but
this
resinous
matter
which
lies
in
the
walls
of
the
spores
and
sporangia
is
a
substance
not
easily
altered
by
air
and
water
and
hence
tends
to
preserve
these
bodies
just
as
the
bituminized
cerecloth
preserves
an
egyptian
mummy
while
on
the
other
hand
the
merely
woody
stem
and
leaves
tend
to
rot
as
fast
as
the
wood
of
the
mummy
coffin
has
rotted
thus
the
mixed
heap
of
spores
leaves
and
stems
in
the
forest
would
be
persistently
searched
by
the
action
of
air
and
rain
the
leaves
and
stems
would
gradually
be
reduced
to
little
but
their
carbon
or
in
other
words
to
the
condition
of
mineral
charcoal
in
which
we
find
them
while
the
spores
and
sporangia
remained
as
a
comparatively
unaltered
and
compact
residuum
there
is
indeed
tolerably
clear
evidence
that
the
coal
must
under
some
circumstances
have
been
converted
into
a
substance
hard
enough
to
be
rolled
into
pebbles
while
it
yet
lay
at
the
surface
of
the
earth
for
in
some
seams
of
coal
the
courses
of
rivulets
which
must
have
been
living
water
while
the
stratum
in
which
their
remains
are
found
was
still
at
the
surface
have
been
observed
to
contain
rolled
pebbles
of
the
very
coal
through
which
the
stream
has
cut
its
way
the
structural
facts
are
such
as
to
leave
no
alternative
but
to
adopt
the
view
of
the
origin
of
such
coal
as
i
have
described
which
has
just
been
stated
but
happily
the
process
is
not
without
analogy
at
the
present
day
i
possess
a
specimen
of
what
is
called
white
coal
from
australia
it
is
an
inflammable
material
burning
with
a
bright
flame
and
having
much
the
consistence
and
appearance
of
which
i
am
informed
covers
a
considerable
area
it
consists
almost
entirely
of
a
compacted
mass
of
spores
and
but
the
fine
particles
of
blown
sand
which
are
scattered
through
it
show
that
it
must
have
accumulated
subaërially
upon
the
surface
of
a
soil
covered
by
a
forest
of
cryptogamous
plants
probably
as
regards
this
important
point
of
the
subaërial
region
of
coal
i
am
glad
to
find
myself
in
entire
accordance
with
principal
dawson
who
bases
his
conclusions
upon
other
but
no
less
forcible
considerations
in
a
passage
which
is
the
continuation
of
that
already
cited
he
writes
the
microscopical
structure
and
chemical
composition
of
the
beds
of
cannel
coal
and
earthy
bitumen
and
of
the
more
highly
bituminous
and
carbonaceous
shale
show
them
to
have
been
of
the
nature
of
the
fine
vegetable
mud
which
accumulates
in
the
ponds
and
shallow
lakes
of
modern
swamps
when
such
tine
vegetable
sediment
is
mixed
as
is
often
the
case
with
clay
it
becomes
similar
to
the
bituminous
limestone
and
bituminous
shales
of
the
a
few
of
the
which
support
beds
of
coal
are
of
the
nature
of
the
vegetable
mud
above
referred
to
but
the
greater
part
are
in
composition
with
little
vegetable
matter
and
bleached
by
the
drainage
from
them
of
water
containing
the
products
of
vegetable
decay
they
are
in
short
loamy
or
clay
soils
and
must
have
been
sufficiently
above
water
to
admit
of
drainage
the
absence
of
sulphurets
and
the
occurrence
of
carbonate
of
iron
in
connection
with
them
prove
that
when
they
existed
as
soils
and
not
percolated
them
the
coal
and
the
fossil
forests
present
many
evidences
of
subaërial
conditions
most
of
the
erect
and
prostrate
trees
had
become
hollow
shells
of
bark
before
they
were
finally
embedded
and
their
wood
had
broken
into
cubical
pieces
of
mineral
charcoal
and
crept
into
them
and
they
became
dens
or
traps
for
reptiles
large
quantities
of
mineral
charcoal
occur
on
the
surface
of
all
the
large
beds
of
coal
none
of
these
appearances
could
have
been
produced
by
subaqueous
action
though
the
roots
of
the
bear
more
resemblance
to
the
rhizomes
of
certain
aquatic
plants
yet
structurally
they
are
absolutely
identical
with
the
roots
of
cycads
which
the
stems
also
resemble
further
the
grew
on
the
same
soils
which
supported
conifers
and
which
could
not
have
grown
in
water
again
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
some
and
there
is
a
remarkable
absence
from
the
coal
measures
of
any
form
of
properly
aquatic
vegetation
the
occurrence
of
marine
or
animals
in
the
roofs
of
beds
or
even
in
the
coal
itself
affords
no
evidence
of
subaqueous
accumulation
since
the
same
thing
occurs
in
the
case
of
modern
submarine
forests
for
these
and
other
reasons
some
of
which
are
more
fully
stated
in
the
papers
already
referred
to
while
i
admit
that
the
areas
of
coal
accumulation
were
frequently
submerged
i
must
maintain
that
the
true
coal
is
a
subaërial
accumulation
by
vegetable
growth
on
soils
wet
and
swampy
it
is
true
but
not
submerged
i
am
almost
disposed
to
doubt
whether
it
is
necessary
to
make
the
concession
of
wet
and
swampy
otherwise
there
is
nothing
that
i
know
of
to
be
said
against
this
excellent
conspectus
of
the
reasons
for
believing
in
the
subaërial
origin
of
coal
but
the
coal
accumulated
upon
the
area
covered
by
one
of
the
great
forests
of
the
carboniferous
epoch
would
in
course
of
time
have
been
wasted
away
by
the
small
but
constant
wear
and
tear
of
rain
and
streams
had
the
land
which
supported
it
remained
at
the
same
level
or
been
gradually
raised
to
a
greater
elevation
and
no
doubt
as
much
coal
as
now
exists
has
been
destroyed
after
its
formation
in
this
way
what
are
now
known
as
coal
districts
owe
their
importance
to
the
fact
that
they
were
areas
of
slow
depression
during
a
greater
or
less
portion
of
the
carboniferous
epoch
and
that
in
virtue
of
this
circumstance
mother
earth
was
enabled
to
cover
up
her
vegetable
treasures
and
preserve
them
from
destruction
wherever
a
now
exists
there
must
formerly
have
been
free
access
for
a
great
river
or
for
a
shallow
sea
bearing
sediment
in
the
shape
of
sand
and
mud
when
the
area
became
slowly
depressed
the
waters
must
have
spread
over
it
and
have
deposited
their
burden
upon
the
surface
of
the
bed
of
coal
in
the
form
of
layers
which
are
now
converted
into
shale
or
sandstone
then
followed
a
period
of
rest
in
which
the
superincumbent
shallow
waters
became
completely
filled
up
and
finally
replaced
by
fine
mud
which
settled
down
into
a
new
and
furnished
the
soil
for
a
fresh
forest
growth
this
flourished
and
heaped
up
its
spores
and
wood
into
coal
until
the
stage
of
slow
depression
recommenced
and
in
some
localities
as
i
have
mentioned
the
process
was
repeated
until
the
first
of
the
alternating
beds
had
sunk
to
near
three
miles
below
its
original
level
at
the
surface
of
the
earth
in
reflecting
on
the
statement
thus
briefly
made
of
the
main
facts
connected
with
the
origin
of
the
coal
formed
during
the
carboniferous
epoch
two
or
three
considerations
suggest
themselves
in
the
first
place
the
great
phantom
of
geological
time
rises
before
the
student
of
this
as
of
all
other
fragments
of
the
history
of
our
earth
springing
irrepressibly
out
of
the
facts
like
the
djin
from
the
jar
which
the
fishermen
so
incautiously
opened
and
like
the
djin
again
being
vaporous
shifting
and
indefinable
but
unmistakably
gigantic
however
modest
the
bases
of
one
calculation
may
be
the
minimum
of
time
assignable
to
the
coal
period
remains
something
stupendous
principal
dawson
is
the
last
person
likely
to
be
guilty
of
exaggeration
in
this
matter
and
it
will
be
well
to
consider
what
he
has
to
say
about
it
the
rate
of
accumulation
of
coal
was
very
slow
the
climate
of
the
period
in
the
northern
temperate
zone
was
of
such
a
character
that
the
true
conifers
show
rings
of
growth
not
larger
nor
much
less
distinct
than
those
of
many
of
their
modern
congeners
the
and
were
not
as
often
supposed
composed
wholly
or
even
principally
of
lax
and
soft
tissues
or
necessarily
the
former
had
it
is
true
a
very
thick
inner
bark
but
their
dense
woody
axis
their
thick
and
nearly
imperishable
outer
bark
and
their
scanty
and
rigid
foliage
would
indicate
no
very
rapid
growth
or
decay
in
the
case
of
the
the
variations
in
the
in
different
parts
of
the
trunk
the
intercalation
of
new
ridges
at
the
surface
representing
that
of
new
woody
wedges
in
the
axis
the
transverse
marks
left
by
the
stages
of
upward
growth
all
indicate
that
several
years
must
have
been
required
for
the
growth
of
stems
of
moderate
size
the
enormous
roots
of
these
trees
and
the
condition
of
the
must
have
exempted
them
from
the
danger
of
being
overthrown
by
violence
they
probably
fell
in
successive
generations
from
natural
decay
and
making
every
allowance
for
other
materials
we
may
safely
assert
that
every
foot
of
thickness
of
pure
bituminous
coal
implies
the
quiet
growth
and
fall
of
at
least
fifty
generations
of
and
therefore
an
undisturbed
condition
of
forest
growth
enduring
through
many
centuries
further
there
is
evidence
that
an
immense
amount
of
loose
parenchymatous
tissue
and
even
of
wood
perished
by
decay
and
we
do
not
know
to
what
extent
even
the
most
durable
tissues
may
have
disappeared
in
this
way
so
that
in
many
we
may
have
only
a
very
small
part
of
the
vegetable
matter
produced
undoubtedly
the
force
of
these
reflections
is
not
diminished
when
the
bituminous
coal
as
in
britain
consists
of
accumulated
spores
and
cases
rather
than
of
stems
but
suppose
we
adopt
principal
assumption
that
one
foot
of
coal
represents
fifty
generations
of
coal
plants
and
further
make
the
moderate
supposition
that
each
generation
of
coal
plants
took
ten
years
to
come
to
maturity
then
each
thickness
of
coal
represents
five
hundred
years
the
superimposed
beds
of
coal
in
one
may
amount
to
a
thickness
of
fifty
or
sixty
feet
and
therefore
the
coal
alone
in
that
field
represents
x
years
but
the
actual
coal
is
but
an
insignificant
portion
of
the
total
deposit
which
as
has
been
seen
may
amount
to
between
two
and
three
miles
of
vertical
thickness
suppose
it
be
feet
which
is
times
the
thickness
of
the
actual
coal
is
there
any
reason
why
we
should
believe
it
may
not
have
taken
times
as
long
to
form
i
know
of
none
but
in
this
case
the
time
which
the

affording
a
definite
chronology
of

such
calculations
as
these
are
of
no
value
but
they
have
much
use
in
fixing
one
attention
upon
a
possible
minimum
a
man
may
be
puzzled
if
he
is
asked
how
long
rome
took
but
he
is
proverbially
safe
if
he
affirms
it
not
to
have
been
built
in
a
day
and
our
geological
calculations
are
all
at
present
pretty
much
on
that
footing
a
second
consideration
which
the
study
of
the
coal
brings
prominently
before
the
mind
of
any
one
who
is
familiar
with
palaeontology
is
that
the
coal
flora
viewed
in
relation
to
the
enormous
period
of
time
which
it
lasted
and
to
the
still
vaster
period
which
has
elapsed
since
it
flourished
underwent
little
change
while
it
endured
and
in
its
peculiar
characters
differs
strangely
little
from
that
which
at
present
exist
the
same
species
of
plants
are
to
be
met
with
throughout
the
whole
thickness
of
a
and
the
youngest
are
not
sensibly
different
from
the
oldest
but
more
than
this
notwithstanding
that
the
carboniferous
period
is
separated
from
us
by
more
than
the
whole
time
represented
by
the
secondary
and
tertiary
formations
the
great
types
of
vegetation
were
as
distinct
then
as
now
the
structure
of
the
modern
furnishes
a
complete
explanation
of
the
fossil
remains
of
the
and
the
fronds
of
some
of
the
ancient
ferns
are
hard
to
distinguish
from
existing
ones
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
remembered
that
there
is
nowhere
in
the
world
at
present
any
which
bears
more
than
a
rough
analogy
with
a
the
types
may
remain
but
the
details
of
their
form
their
relative
proportions
their
associates
are
all
altered
and
the
forest
of
tasmania
or
new
zealand
gives
one
only
a
faint
and
remote
image
of
the
vegetation
of
the
ancient
world
once
more
an
lesson
of
geological
history
at
whatever
point
its
study
is
taken
up
the
lesson
of
the
almost
infinite
slowness
of
the
modification
of
living
forms
the
lines
of
the
pedigrees
of
living
things
break
off
almost
before
they
begin
to
converge
finally
yet
another
curious
consideration
let
us
suppose
that
one
of
the
stupid
labyrinthodonts
which
pottered
with
much
belly
and
little
leg
like
falstaff
in
his
old
age
among
the
forests
could
have
had
thinking
power
enough
in
his
small
brain
to
reflect
upon
the
showers
of
spores
which
kept
on
falling
through
years
and
centuries
while
perhaps
not
one
in
ten
million
fulfilled
its
apparent
purpose
and
reproduced
the
organism
which
gave
it
birth
surely
he
might
have
been
excused
for
moralizing
upon
the
thoughtless
and
wanton
extravagance
which
nature
displayed
in
her
operations
but
we
have
the
advantage
over
our
predecessor
or
possibly
ancestor
and
can
perceive
that
a
certain
vein
of
thrift
runs
through
this
apparent
prodigality
nature
is
never
in
a
hurry
and
seems
to
have
had
always
before
her
eyes
the
adage
keep
a
thing
long
enough
and
you
will
find
a
use
for
it
she
has
kept
her
beds
of
coal
many
millions
of
years
without
being
able
to
find
much
use
for
them
she
has
sent
them
down
beneath
the
sea
and
the
could
make
nothing
of
them
she
has
raised
them
up
into
dry
land
and
laid
the
black
veins
bare
and
still
for
ages
and
ages
there
was
no
living
thing
on
the
face
of
the
earth
that
could
see
any
sort
of
value
in
them
and
it
was
only
the
other
day
so
to
speak
that
she
turned
a
new
creature
out
of
her
workshop
who
by
degrees
acquired
sufficient
wits
to
make
a
fire
and
then
to
discover
that
the
black
rock
would
burn
i
suppose
that
nineteen
hundred
years
ago
when
julius
caesar
was
good
enough
to
deal
with
britain
as
we
have
dealt
with
new
zealand
the
primaeval
briton
blue
with
cold
and
woad
may
have
known
that
the
strange
black
stone
of
which
he
found
lumps
here
and
there
in
his
wanderings
would
burn
and
so
help
to
warm
his
body
and
cook
his
food
saxon
dane
and
norman
swarmed
into
the
land
the
english
people
grew
into
a
powerful
nation
and
nature
still
waited
for
a
full
return
of
the
capital
she
had
invested
in
the
ancient
the
eighteenth
century
arrived
and
with
it
james
watt
the
brain
of
that
man
was
the
spore
out
of
which
was
developed
the
modern
and
all
the
prodigious
trees
and
branches
of
modern
industry
which
have
grown
out
of
this
but
coal
is
as
much
an
essential
condition
of
this
growth
and
development
as
carbonic
acid
is
for
that
of
a
wanting
coal
we
could
not
have
smelted
the
iron
needed
to
make
our
engines
nor
have
worked
our
engines
when
we
had
got
them
but
take
away
the
engines
and
the
great
towns
of
yorkshire
and
lancashire
vanish
like
a
dream
manufactures
give
place
to
agriculture
and
pasture
and
not
ten
men
can
live
where
now
ten
thousand
are
amply
supported
thus
all
this
abundant
wealth
of
money
and
of
vivid
life
is
interest
upon
her
investment
in
and
the
like
so
long
ago
but
what
becomes
of
the
coal
which
is
burnt
in
yielding
this
interest
heat
comes
out
of
it
light
comes
out
of
it
and
if
we
could
gather
together
all
that
goes
up
the
chimney
and
all
that
remains
in
the
grate
of
a
we
should
find
ourselves
in
possession
of
a
quantity
of
carbonic
acid
water
ammonia
and
mineral
matters
exactly
equal
in
weight
to
the
coal
but
these
are
the
very
matters
with
which
nature
supplied
the
which
made
the
coal
she
is
paid
back
principal
and
interest
at
the
same
time
and
she
straightway
invests
the
carbonic

the
water
and
the
ammonia
in
new
forms
of
life

with
them

vi
on
the
border
territory
between
the
animal
and
the
vegetable
kingdoms
in
the
whole
history
of
science
there
is
nothing
more
remarkable
than
the
rapidity
of
the
growth
of
biological
knowledge
within
the
last
century
and
the
extent
of
the
modification
which
has
thereby
been
effected
in
some
of
the
fundamental
conceptions
of
the
naturalist
in
the
second
edition
of
the
règne
animal
published
in
cuvier
devotes
a
special
section
to
the
division
of
organised
beings
into
animals
and
vegetables
in
which
the
question
is
treated
with
that
comprehensiveness
of
knowledge
and
clear
critical
judgment
which
characterise
his
writings
and
justify
us
in
regarding
them
as
representative
expressions
of
the
most
extensive
if
not
the
profoundest
knowledge
of
his
time
he
tells
us
that
living
beings
have
been
subdivided
from
the
earliest
times
into
which
possess
sense
and
motion
and
which
are
devoid
of
these
functions
and
simply
vegetate
although
the
roots
of
plants
direct
themselves
towards
moisture
and
their
leaves
towards
air
and
light
although
the
parts
of
some
plants
exhibit
oscillating
movements
without
any
perceptible
cause
and
the
leaves
of
others
retract
when
touched
yet
none
of
these
movements
justify
the
ascription
to
plants
of
perception
or
of
will
from
the
mobility
of
animals
cuvier
with
his
characteristic
partiality
for
teleological
reasoning
deduces
the
necessity
of
the
existence
in
them
of
an
alimentary
cavity
or
reservoir
of
food
whence
their
nutrition
may
be
drawn
by
the
vessels
which
are
a
sort
of
internal
roots
and
in
the
presence
of
this
alimentary
cavity
he
naturally
sees
the
primary
and
the
most
important
distinction
between
animals
and
plants
following
out
his
teleological
argument
cuvier
remarks
that
the
organisation
of
this
cavity
and
its
appurtenances
must
needs
vary
according
to
the
nature
of
the
aliment
and
the
operations
which
it
has
to
undergo
before
it
can
be
converted
into
substances
fitted
for
absorption
while
the
atmosphere
and
the
earth
supply
plants
with
juices
ready
prepared
and
which
can
be
absorbed
immediately
as
the
animal
body
required
to
be
independent
of
heat
and
of
the
atmosphere
there
were
no
means
by
which
the
motion
of
its
fluids
could
be
produced
by
internal
causes
hence
arose
the
second
great
distinctive
character
of
animals
or
the
circulatory
system
which
is
less
important
than
the
digestive
since
it
was
unnecessary
and
therefore
is
absent
in
the
more
simple
animals
animals
further
needed
muscles
for
locomotion
and
nerves
for
sensibility
hence
says
cuvier
it
was
necessary
that
the
chemical
composition
of
the
animal
body
should
be
more
complicated
than
that
of
the
plant
and
it
is
so
inasmuch
as
an
additional
substance
nitrogen
enters
into
it
as
an
essential
element
while
in
plants
nitrogen
is
only
accidentally
joined
with
he
three
other
fundamental
constituents
of
organic
beings
carbon
hydrogen
and
oxygen
indeed
he
afterwards
affirms
that
nitrogen
is
peculiar
to
animals
and
herein
he
places
the
third
distinction
between
the
animal
and
the
plant
the
soil
and
the
atmosphere
supply
plants
with
water
composed
of
hydrogen
and
oxygen
air
consisting
of
nitrogen
and
oxygen
and
carbonic
acid
containing
carbon
and
oxygen
they
retain
the
hydrogen
and
the
carbon
exhale
the
superfluous
oxygen
and
absorb
little
or
no
nitrogen
the
essential
character
of
vegetable
life
is
the
exhalation
of
oxygen
which
is
effected
through
the
agency
of
light
animals
on
the
contrary
derive
their
nourishment
either
directly
or
indirectly
from
plants
they
get
rid
of
the
superfluous
hydrogen
and
carbon
and
accumulate
nitrogen
the
relations
of
plants
and
animals
to
the
atmosphere
are
therefore
inverse
the
plant
withdraws
water
and
carbonic
acid
from
the
atmosphere
the
animal
contributes
both
to
it
respiration
that
is
the
absorption
of
oxygen
and
the
exhalation
of
carbonic
acid
is
the
specially
animal
function
of
animals
and
constitutes
their
fourth
distinctive
character
thus
wrote
cuvier
in
but
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
decades
of
this
century
the
greatest
and
most
rapid
revolution
which
biological
science
has
ever
undergone
was
effected
by
the
application
of
the
modern
microscope
to
the
investigation
of
organic
structure
by
the
introduction
of
exact
and
easily
manageable
methods
of
conducting
the
chemical
analysis
of
organic
compounds
and
finally
by
the
employment
of
instruments
of
precision
for
the
measurement
of
the
physical
forces
which
are
at
work
in
the
living
economy
that
the
contents
which
we
now
term
protoplasm
of
the
cells
of
certain
plants
such
as
the
are
in
constant
and
regular
motion
was
made
out
by
bonaventura
corti
a
century
ago
but
the
fact
important
as
it
was
fell
into
oblivion
and
had
to
be
rediscovered
by
treviranus
in
robert
brown
noted
the
more
complex
motions
of
the
protoplasm
in
the
cells
of
in
and
now
such
movements
of
the
living
substance
of
plants
are
well
known
to
be
some
of
the
most
phenomena
of
vegetable
life
agardh
and
other
of
the
botanists
of
cuvier
generation
who
occupied
themselves
with
the
lower
plants
had
observed
that
under
particular
circumstances
the
contents
of
the
cells
of
certain
were
set
free
and
moved
about
with
considerable
velocity
and
with
all
the
appearances
of
spontaneity
as
locomotive
bodies
which
from
their
similarity
to
animals
of
simple
organisation
were
called
zoospores
even
as
late
as
however
a
botanist
of
schleiden
eminence
dealt
very
sceptically
with
these
statements
and
his
scepticism
was
the
more
justified
since
ehrenberg
in
his
elaborate
and
comprehensive
work
on
the
had
declared
the
greater
number
of
what
are
now
recognised
as
locomotive
plants
to
be
animals
at
the
present
day
innumerable
plants
and
free
plant
cells
are
known
to
pass
the
whole
or
part
of
their
lives
in
an
actively
locomotive
condition
in
no
wise
distinguishable
from
that
of
one
of
the
simpler
animals
and
while
in
this
condition
their
movements
are
to
all
appearance
as
spontaneous
as
much
the
product
of
volition
as
those
of
such
animals
hence
the
teleological
argument
for
cuvier
first
diagnostic
character
the
presence
in
animals
of
an
alimentary
cavity
or
internal
pocket
in
which
they
can
carry
about
their
nutriment
has
broken
down
so
far
at
least
as
his
mode
of
stating
it
goes
and
with
the
advance
of
microscopic
anatomy
the
universality
of
the
fact
itself
among
animals
has
ceased
to
be
predicable
many
animals
of
even
complex
structure
which
live
parasitically
within
others
are
wholly
devoid
of
an
alimentary
cavity
their
food
is
provided
for
them
not
only
ready
cooked
but
ready
digested
and
the
alimentary
canal
become
superfluous
has
disappeared
again
the
males
of
most
rotifers
have
no
digestive
apparatus
as
a
german
naturalist
has
remarked
they
devote
themselves
entirely
to
the
minnedienst
and
are
to
be
reckoned
among
the
few
realisations
of
the
byronic
ideal
of
a
lover
finally
amidst
the
lowest
forms
of
animal
life
the
speck
of
gelatinous
protoplasm
which
constitutes
the
whole
body
has
no
permanent
digestive
cavity
or
mouth
but
takes
in
its
food
anywhere
and
digests
so
to
speak
all
over
its
body
but
although
cuvier
leading
diagnosis
of
the
animal
from
the
plant
will
not
stand
a
strict
test
it
remains
one
of
the
most
constant
of
the
distinctive
characters
of
animals
and
if
we
substitute
for
the
possession
of
an
alimentary
cavity
the
power
of
taking
solid
nutriment
into
the
body
and
there
digesting
it
the
definition
so
changed
will
cover
all
animals
except
certain
parasites
and
the
few
and
exceptional
cases
of
animals
which
do
not
feed
at
all
on
the
other
hand
the
definition
thus
amended
will
exclude
all
ordinary
vegetable
organisms
cuvier
himself
practically
gives
up
his
second
distinctive
mark
when
he
admits
that
it
is
wanting
in
the
simpler
animals
the
third
distinction
is
based
on
a
completely
erroneous
conception
of
the
chemical
differences
and
resemblances
between
the
constituents
of
animal
and
vegetable
organisms
for
which
cuvier
is
not
responsible
as
it
was
current
among
contemporary
chemists
it
is
now
established
that
nitrogen
is
as
essential
a
constituent
of
vegetable
as
of
animal
living
matter
and
that
the
latter
is
chemically
speaking
just
as
complicated
as
the
former
starchy
substances
cellulose
and
sugar
once
supposed
to
be
exclusively
confined
to
plants
are
now
known
to
be
regular
and
normal
products
of
animals
amylaceous
and
saccharine
substances
are
largely
manufactured
even
by
the
highest
animals
cellulose
is
widespread
as
a
constituent
of
the
skeletons
of
the
lower
animals
and
it
is
probable
that
amyloid
substances
are
universally
present
in
the
animal
organism
though
not
in
the
precise
form
of
starch
moreover
although
it
remains
true
that
there
is
an
inverse
relation
between
the
green
plant
in
sunshine
and
the
animal
in
so
far
as
under
these
circumstances
the
green
plant
decomposes
carbonic
acid
and
exhales
oxygen
while
the
animal
absorbs
oxygen
and
exhales
carbonic
acid
yet
the
exact
researches
of
the
modern
chemical
investigators
of
the
physiological
processes
of
plants
have
clearly
demonstrated
the
fallacy
of
attempting
to
draw
any
general
distinction
between
animals
and
vegetables
on
this
ground
in
fact
the
difference
vanishes
with
the
sunshine
even
in
the
case
of
the
green
plant
which
in
the
dark
absorbs
oxygen
and
gives
out
carbonic
acid
like
any
animal
on
the
other
hand
those
plants
such
as
the
fungi
which
contain
no
chlorophyll
and
are
not
green
are
always
so
far
as
respiration
is
concerned
in
the
exact
position
of
animals
they
absorb
oxygen
and
give
out
carbonic
acid
footnote
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
living
plants
like
living
animals
always
respire
and
in
respiring
absorb
oxygen
and
give
off
carbonic
acid
but
that
in
green
plants
exposed
to
daylight
or
to
the
electric
light
the
quantity
of
oxygen
evolved
in
consequence
of
the
decomposition
of
carbonic
acid
by
a
special
apparatus
which
green
plants
possess
exceeds
that
absorbed
in
the
concurrent
respiratory
process
thus
by
the
progress
of
knowledge
cuvier
fourth
distinction
between
the
animal
and
the
plant
has
been
as
completely
invalidated
as
the
third
and
second
and
even
the
first
can
be
retained
only
in
a
modified
form
and
subject
to
exceptions
but
has
the
advance
of
biology
simply
tended
to
break
down
old
distinctions
without
establishing
new
ones
with
a
qualification
to
be
considered
presently
the
answer
to
this
question
is
undoubtedly
in
the
affirmative
the
famous
researches
of
schwann
and
schleiden
in

following
years

modern
science
of
histology

organisms

by
the
microscope

that
day

rapid
improvement
of

of
investigation

energy
of
a

of
accurate
observers

greater
and
greater
breadth
and
firmness
to
schwann
great
generalisation
that
a
fundamental
unity
of
structure
obtains
in
animals
and
plants
and
that
however
diverse
may
be
the
fabrics
or
of
which
their
bodies
are
composed
all
these
varied
structures
result
from
the
metamorphosis
of
morphological
units
termed
in
a
more
general
sense
than
that
in
which
the
word
cells
was
at
first
employed
which
are
not
only
similar
in
animals
and
in
plants
respectively
but
present
a
close
resemblance
when
those
of
animals
and
those
of
plants
are
compared
together
the
contractility
which
is
the
fundamental
condition
of
locomotion
has
not
only
been
discovered
to
exist
far
more
widely
among
plants
than
was
formerly
imagined
but
in
plants
the
act
of
contraction
has
been
found
to
be
accompanied
as
burdon
sanderson
interesting
investigations
have
shown
by
a
disturbance
of
the
electrical
state
of
the
contractile
substance
comparable
to
that
which
was
found
by
du
bois
reymond
to
be
a
concomitant
of
the
activity
of
ordinary
muscle
in
animals
again
i
know
of
no
test
by
which
the
reaction
of
the
leaves
of
the
sundew
and
of
other
plants
to
stimuli
so
fully
and
carefully
studied
by
darwin
can
be
distinguished
from
those
acts
of
contraction
following
upon
stimuli
which
are
called
reflex
in
animals
on
each
lobe
of
the
bilobed
leaf
of
venus
are
three
delicate
filaments
which
stand
out
at
right
angle
from
the
surface
of
the
leaf
touch
one
of
them
with
the
end
of
a
fine
human
hair
and
the
lobes
of
the
leaf
instantly
close
together
in
virtue
of
an
act
of
contraction
of
part
of
their
substance
just
as
the
body
of
a
snail
contracts
into
its
shell
when
one
of
its
horns
is
irritated
footnote
darwin
p
the
reflex
action
of
the
snail
is
the
result
of
the
presence
of
a
nervous
system
in
the
animal
a
molecular
change
takes
place
in
the
nerve
of
the
tentacle
is
propagated
to
the
muscles
by
which
the
body
is
retracted
and
causing
them
to
contract
the
act
of
retraction
is
brought
about
of
course
the
similarity
of
the
acts
does
not
necessarily
involve
the
conclusion
that
the
mechanism
by
which
they
are
effected
is
the
same
but
it
suggests
a
suspicion
of
their
identity
which
needs
careful
testing
the
results
of
recent
inquiries
into
the
structure
of
the
nervous
system
of
animals
converge
towards
the
conclusion
that
the
nerve
fibres
which
we
have
hitherto
regarded
as
ultimate
elements
of
nervous
tissue
are
not
such
but
are
simply
the
visible
aggregations
of
vastly
more
attenuated
filaments
the
diameter
of
which
dwindles
down
to
the
limits
of
our
present
microscopic
vision
greatly
as
these
have
been
extended
by
modern
improvements
of
the
microscope
and
that
a
nerve
is
in
its
essence
nothing
but
a
linear
tract
of
specially
modified
protoplasm
between
two
points
of
an
organism
one
of
which
is
able
to
affect
the
other
by
means
of
the
communication
so
established
hence
it
is
conceivable
that
even
the
simplest
living
being
may
possess
a
nervous
system
and
the
question
whether
plants
are
provided
with
a
nervous
system
or
not
thus
acquires
a
new
aspect
and
presents
the
histologist
and
physiologist
with
a
problem
of
extreme
difficulty
which
must
be
attacked
from
a
new
point
of
view
and
by
the
aid
of
methods
which
have
yet
to
be
invented
thus
it
must
be
admitted
that
plants
may
be
contractile
and
locomotive
that
while
locomotive
their
movements
may
have
as
much
appearance
of
spontaneity
as
those
of
the
lowest
animals
and
that
many
exhibit
actions
comparable
to
those
which
are
brought
about
by
the
agency
of
a
nervous
system
in
animals
and
it
must
be
allowed
to
be
possible
that
further
research
may
reveal
the
existence
of
something
comparable
to
a
nervous
system
in
plants
so
that
i
know
not
where
we
can
hope
to
find
any
absolute
distinction
between
animals
and
plants
unless
we
return
to
their
mode
of
nutrition
and
inquire
whether
certain
differences
of
a
more
occult
character
than
those
imagined
to
exist
by
cuvier
and
which
certainly
hold
good
for
the
vast
majority
of
animals
and
plants
are
of
universal
application
a
bean
may
be
supplied
with
water
in
which
salts
of
ammonia
and
certain
other
mineral
salts
are
dissolved
in
due
proportion
with
atmospheric
air
containing
its
ordinary
minute
dose
of
carbonic
acid
and
with
nothing
else
but
sunlight
and
heat
under
these
circumstances
unnatural
as
they
are
with
proper
management
the
bean
will
thrust
forth
its
radicle
and
its
plumule
the
former
will
grow
down
into
roots
the
latter
grow
up
into
the
stem
and
leaves
of
a
vigorous
and
this
plant
will
in
due
time
flower
and
produce
its
crop
of
beans
just
as
if
it
were
grown
in
the
garden
or
in
the
field
the
weight
of
the
nitrogenous
protein
compounds
of
the
oily
starchy
saccharine
and
woody
substances
contained
in
the
plant
and
its
seeds
will
be
vastly
greater
than
the
weight
of
the
same
substances
contained
in
the
bean
from
which
it
sprang
but
nothing
has
been
supplied
to
the
bean
save
water
carbonic
acid
ammonia
potash
lime
iron
and
the
like
in
combination
with
phosphoric
sulphuric
and
other
acids
neither
protein
nor
fat
nor
starch
nor
sugar
nor
any
substance
in
the
slightest
degree
resembling
them
has
formed
part
of
the
food
of
the
bean
but
the
weights
of
the
carbon
hydrogen
oxygen
nitrogen
phosphorus
sulphur
and
other
elementary
bodies
contained
in
the
plant
and
in
the
seeds
which
it
produces
are
exactly
equivalent
to
the
weights
of
the
same
elements
which
have
disappeared
from
the
materials
supplied
to
the
bean
during
its
growth
whence
it
follows
that
the
bean
has
taken
in
only
the
raw
materials
of
its
fabric
and
has
manufactured
them
into
the
bean
has
been
able
to
perform
this
great
chemical
feat
by
the
help
of
its
green
colouring
matter
or
chlorophyll
for
it
is
only
the
green
parts
of
the
plant
which
under
the
influence
of
sunlight
have
the
marvellous
power
of
decomposing
carbonic
acid
setting
free
the
oxygen
and
laying
hold
of
the
carbon
which
it
contains
in
fact
the
bean
obtains
two
of
the
absolutely
indispensable
elements
of
its
substance
from
two
distinct
sources
the
watery
solution
in
which
its
roots
are
plunged
contains
nitrogen
but
no
carbon
the
air
to
which
the
leaves
are
exposed
contains
carbon
but
its
nitrogen
is
in
the
state
of
a
free
gas
in
which
condition
the
bean
can
make
no
use
of
it
and
the
chlorophyll
is
the
apparatus
by
which
the
carbon
is
extracted
from
the
atmospheric
carbonic
acid
the
leaves
being
the
chief
laboratories
in
which
this
operation
is
effected
footnote
i
purposely
assume
that
the
air
with
which
the
bean
is
supplied
in
the
case
stated
contains
no
ammoniacal
salts
footnote
the
recent
researches
of
pringsheim
have
raised
a
host
of
questions
as
to
the
exact
share
taken
by
chlorophyll
in
the
chemical
operations
which
are
effected
by
the
green
parts
of
plants
it
may
be
that
the
chlorophyll
is
only
a
constant
concomitant
of
the
actual
deoxidising
apparatus
the
great
majority
of
conspicuous
plants
are
as
everybody
knows
green
and
this
arises
from
the
abundance
of
their
chlorophyll
the
few
which
contain
no
chlorophyll
and
are
colourless
are
unable
to
extract
the
carbon
which
they
require
from
atmospheric
carbonic
acid
and
lead
a
parasitic
existence
upon
other
plants
but
it
by
no
means
follows
often
as
the
statement
has
been
repeated
that
the
manufacturing
power
of
plants
depends
on
their
chlorophyll
and
its
interaction
with
the
rays
of
the
sun
on
the
contrary
it
is
easily
demonstrated
as
pasteur
first
proved
that
the
lowest
fungi
devoid
of
chlorophyll
or
of
any
substitute
for
it
as
they
are
nevertheless
possess
the
characteristic
manufacturing
powers
of
plants
in
a
very
high
degree
only
it
is
necessary
that
they
should
be
supplied
with
a
different
kind
of
raw
material
as
they
can
not
extract
carbon
from
carbonic
acid
they
must
be
furnished
with
something
else
that
contains
carbon
tartaric
acid
is
such
a
substance
and
if
a
single
spore
of
the
commonest
and
most
troublesome
of
moulds
be
sown
in
a
saucerful
of
water
in
which
tartrate
of
ammonia
with
a
small
percentage
of
phosphates
and
sulphates
is
contained
and
kept
warm
whether
in
the
dark
or
exposed
to
light
it
will
in
a
short
time
give
rise
to
a
thick
crust
of
mould
which
contains
many
million
times
the
weight
of
the
original
spore
in
protein
compounds
and
cellulose
thus
we
have
a
very
wide
basis
of
fact
for
the
generalisation
that
plants
are
essentially
characterised
by
their
manufacturing
capacity
by
their
power
of
working
up
mere
mineral
matters
into
complex
organic
compounds
contrariwise
there
is
a
no
less
wide
foundation
for
the
generalisation
that
animals
as
cuvier
puts
it
depend
directly
or
indirectly
upon
plants
for
the
materials
of
their
bodies
that
is
either
they
are
herbivorous
or
they
eat
other
animals
which
are
herbivorous
but
for
what
constituents
of
their
bodies
are
animals
thus
dependent
upon
plants
certainly
not
for
their
horny
matter
nor
for
chondrin
the
proximate
chemical
element
of
cartilage
nor
for
gelatine
nor
for
syntonin
the
constituent
of
muscle
nor
for
their
nervous
or
biliary
substances
nor
for
their
amyloid
matters
nor
necessarily
for
their
fats
it
can
be
experimentally
demonstrated
that
animals
can
make
these
for
themselves
but
that
which
they
can
not
make
but
must
in
all
known
cases
obtain
directly
or
indirectly
from
plants
is
the
peculiar
nitrogenous
matter
protein
thus
the
plant
is
the
ideal
of
the
living
world
the
worker
who
produces
the
animal
the
ideal
aristocrat
who
mostly
occupies
himself
in
consuming
after
the
manner
of
that
noble
representative
of
the
line
of
zähdarm
whose
epitaph
is
written
in
sartor
resartus
here
is
our
last
hope
of
finding
a
sharp
line
of
demarcation
between
plants
and
animals
for
as
i
have
already
hinted
there
is
a
border
territory
between
the
two
kingdoms
a
sort
of
the
inhabitants
of
which
certainly
can
not
be
discriminated
and
brought
to
their
proper
allegiance
in
any
other
way
some
months
ago
professor
tyndall
asked
me
to
examine
a
drop
of
infusion
of
hay
placed
under
an
excellent
and
powerful
microscope
and
to
tell
him
what
i
thought
some
organisms
visible
in
it
were
i
looked
and
observed
in
the
first
place
multitudes
of
moving
about
with
their
ordinary
intermittent
spasmodic
wriggles
as
to
the
vegetable
nature
of
these
there
is
now
no
doubt
not
only
does
the
close
resemblance
of
the
to
unquestionable
plants
such
as
the
and
the
lower
forms
of
justify
this
conclusion
but
the
manufacturing
test
settles
the
question
at
once
it
is
only
needful
to
add
a
minute
drop
of
fluid
containing
to
water
in
which
tartrate
phosphate
and
sulphate
of
ammonia
are
dissolved
and
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
the
clear
fluid
becomes
milky
by
reason
of
their
prodigious
multiplication
which
of
course
implies
the
manufacture
of
living
out
of
these
merely
saline
matters
but
other
active
organisms
very
much
larger
than
the
attaining
in
fact
the
comparatively
gigantic
dimensions
of
of
an
inch
or
more
incessantly
crossed
the
field
of
view
each
of
these
had
a
body
shaped
like
a
pear
the
small
end
being
slightly
incurved
and
produced
into
a
long
curved
filament
or
of
extreme
tenuity
behind
this
from
the
concave
side
of
the
incurvation
proceeded
another
long
cilium
so
delicate
as
to
be
discernible
only
by
the
use
of
the
highest
powers
and
careful
management
of
the
light
in
the
centre
of
the
body
a
clear
round
space
could
occasionally
be
discerned
but
not
always
and
careful
watching
showed
that
this
clear
vacuity
appeared
gradually
and
then
shut
up
and
disappeared
suddenly
at
regular
intervals
such
a
structure
is
of
common
occurrence
among
the
lowest
plants
and
animals
and
is
known
as
a
the
little
creature
thus
described
sometimes
propelled
itself
with
great
activity
with
a
curious
rolling
motion
by
the
lashing
of
the
front
cilium
while
the
second
cilium
trailed
behind
sometimes
it
anchored
itself
by
the
hinder
cilium
and
was
spun
round
by
the
working
of
the
other
its
motions
resembling
those
of
an
anchor
buoy
in
a
heavy
sea
sometimes
when
two
were
in
full
career
towards
one
another
each
would
appear
dexterously
to
get
out
of
the
other
way
sometimes
a
crowd
would
assemble
and
jostle
one
another
with
as
much
semblance
of
individual
effort
as
a
spectator
on
the
grands
mulets
might
observe
with
a
telescope
among
the
specks
representing
men
in
the
valley
of
chamounix
the
spectacle
though
always
surprising
was
not
new
to
me
so
my
reply
to
the
question
put
to
me
was
that
these
organisms
were
what
biologists
call
and
though
they
might
be
animals
it
was
also
possible
that
they
might
like
the
be
plants
my
friend
received
my
verdict
with
an
expression
which
showed
a
sad
want
of
respect
for
authority
he
would
as
soon
believe
that
a
sheep
was
a
plant
naturally
piqued
by
this
want
of
faith
i
have
thought
a
good
deal
over
the
matter
and
as
i
still
rest
in
the
lame
conclusion
i
originally
expressed
and
must
even
now
confess
that
i
can
not
certainly
say
whether
this
creature
is
an
animal
or
a
plant
i
think
it
may
be
well
to
state
the
grounds
of
my
hesitation
at
length
but
in
the
first
place
in
order
that
i
may
conveniently
distinguish
this
monad
from
the
multitude
of
other
things
which
go
by
the
same
designation
i
must
give
it
a
name
of
its
own
i
think
though
for
reasons
which
need
not
be
stated
at
present
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
it
is
identical
with
the
species
as
defined
by
the
eminent
french
microscopist
dujardin
though
his
magnifying
power
was
probably
insufficient
to
enable
him
to
see
that
it
is
curiously
like
a
much
larger
form
of
monad
which
he
has
named
i
shall
therefore
call
it
not
but
i
have
been
unable
to
devote
to
my
the
prolonged
study
needful
to
work
out
its
whole
history
which
would
involve
weeks
or
it
may
be
months
of
unremitting
attention
but
i
the
less
regret
this
circumstance
as
some
remarkable
observations
recently
published
by
dallinger
and
drysdale
on
certain
monads
relate
in
part
to
a
form
so
similar
to
my
that
the
history
of
the
one
may
be
used
to
illustrate
that
of
the
other

and

each
swam
away
by
itself
a
complete
provided
with
its
two
cilia
sometimes
the
constriction
took
a
longitudinal
direction
with
the
same
ultimate
result
in
each
case
the
process
occupied
not
more
than
six
or
seven
minutes
at
this
rate
a
single
would
give
rise
to
a
thousand
like
itself
in
the
course
of
an
hour
to
about
a
million
in
two
hours
and
to
a
number
greater
than
the
generally
assumed
number
of
human
beings
now
living
in
the
world
in
three
hours
or
if
we
give
each
an
enjoyment
of
individual
existence
the
same
result
will
be
obtained
in
about
a
day
the
apparent
suddenness
of
the
appearance
of
multitudes
of
such
organisms
as
these
in
any
nutritive
fluid
to
which
one
obtains
access
is
thus
easily
explained
during
these
processes
of
multiplication
by
fission
the
remains
active
but
sometimes
another
mode
of
fission
occurs
the
body
becomes
rounded
and
quiescent
or
nearly
so
and
while
in
this
resting
state
divides
into
two
portions
each
of
which
is
rapidly
converted
into
an
active
a
still
more
remarkable
phenomenon
is
that
kind
of
multiplication
which
is
preceded
by
the
union
of
two
monads
by
a
process
which
is
termed
two
active
become
applied
to
one
another
and
then
slowly
and
gradually
coalesce
into
one
body
the
two
nuclei
run
into
one
and
the
mass
resulting
from
the
conjugation
of
the
two
thus
fused
together
has
a
triangular
form
the
two
pairs
of
cilia
are
to
be
seen
for
some
time
at
two
of
the
angles
which
answer
to
the
small
ends
of
the
conjoined
monads
but
they
ultimately
vanish
and
the
twin
organism
in
which
all
visible
traces
of
organisation
have
disappeared
falls
into
a
state
of
rest
sudden
like
movements
of
its
substance
next
occur
and
in
a
short
time
the
apices
of
the
triangular
mass
burst
and
give
exit
to
a
dense
yellowish
glairy
fluid
filled
with
minute
granules
this
process
which
it
will
be
observed
involves
the
actual
confluence
and
mixture
of
the
substance
of
two
distinct
organisms
is
effected
in
the
space
of
about
two
hours
the
authors
whom
i
quote
say
that
they
can
not
express
the
excessive
minuteness
of
the
granules
in
question
and
they
estimate
their
diameter
at
less
than
of
an
inch
under
the
highest
powers
of
the
microscope
at
present
applicable
such
specks
are
hardly
discernible
nevertheless
particles
of
this
size
are
massive
when
compared
to
physical
molecules
whence
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
each
small
as
it
is
may
have
a
molecular
structure
sufficiently
complex
to
give
rise
to
the
phenomena
of
life
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
by
patient
watching
of
the
place
at
which
these
infinitesimal
living
particles
were
discharged
our
observers
assured
themselves
of
their
growth
and
development
into
new
monads
in
about
four
hours
from
their
being
set
free
they
had
attained
a
sixth
of
the
length
of
the
parent
with
the
characteristic
cilia
though
at
first
they
were
quite
motionless
and
in
four
hours
more
they
had
attained
the
dimensions
and
exhibited
all
the
activity
of
the
adult
these
inconceivably
minute
particles
are
therefore
the
germs
of
the
and
from
the
dimensions
of
these
germs
it
is
easily
shown
that
the
body
formed
by
conjugation
may
at
a
low
estimate
have
given
exit
to
thirty
thousand
of
them
a
result
of
a
matrimonial
process
whereby
the
contracting
parties
without
a
metaphor
become
one
flesh
enough
to
make
a
malthusian
despair
of
the
future
of
the
universe
i
am
not
aware
that
the
investigators
from
whom
i
have
borrowed
this
history
have
endeavoured
to
ascertain
whether
their
monads
take
solid
nutriment
or
not
so
that
though
they
help
us
very
much
to
fill
up
the
blanks
in
the
history
of
my
their
observations
throw
no
light
on
the
problem
we
are
trying
to
solve
is
it
an
animal
or
is
it
a
plant
undoubtedly
it
is
possible
to
bring
forward
very
strong
arguments
in
favour
of
regarding
as
a
plant
for
example
there
is
a
fungus
an
obscure
and
almost
microscopic
mould
termed
like
many
other
fungi
the
are
parasitic
upon
other
plants
and
this
particular
happens
to
have
attained
much
notoriety
and
political
importance
in
a
way
not
without
a
parallel
in
the
career
of
notorious
politicians
namely
by
reason
of
the
frightful
mischief
it
has
done
to
mankind
for
it
is
this
which
is
the
cause
of
the
potato
disease
and
therefore
doubtless
of
exclusively
saxon
origin
though
not
accurately
known
to
be
so
brought
about
the
irish
famine
the
plants
afflicted
with
the
malady
are
found
to
be
infested
by
a
mould
consisting
of
fine
tubular
filaments
termed
which
burrow
through
the
substance
of
the
potato
plant
and
appropriate
to
themselves
the
substance
of
their
host
while
at
the
same
time
directly
or
indirectly
they
set
up
chemical
changes
by
which
even
its
woody
framework
becomes
blackened
sodden
and
withered
in
structure
however
the
is
as
much
a
mould
as
the
common
and
just
as
the
multiplies
by
the
breaking
up
of
its
hyphoe
into
separate
rounded
bodies
the
spores
so
in
the
certain
of
the
hyphoe
grow
out
into
the
air
through
the
interstices
of
the
superficial
cells
of
the
potato
plant
and
develop
spores
each
of
these
hyphoe
usually
gives
off
several
branches
the
ends
of
the
branches
dilate
and
become
closed
sacs
which
eventually
drop
off
as
spores
the
spores
falling
on
some
part
of
the
same
potato
plant
or
carried
by
the
wind
to
another
may
at
once
germinate
throwing
out
tubular
prolongations
which
become
hyphoe
and
burrow
into
the
substance
of
the
plant
attacked
but
more
commonly
the
contents
of
the
spore
divide
into
six
or
eight
separate
portions
the
coat
of
the
spore
gives
way
and
each
portion
then
emerges
as
an
independent
organism
which
has
the
shape
of
a
bean
rather
narrower
at
one
end
than
the
other
convex
on
one
side
and
depressed
or
concave
on
the
opposite
from
the
depression
two
long
and
delicate
cilia
proceed
one
shorter
than
the
other
and
directed
forwards
close
to
the
origin
of
these
cilia
in
the
substance
of
the
body
is
a
regularly
pulsating
contractile
vacuole
the
shorter
cilium
vibrates
actively
and
effects
the
locomotion
of
the
organism
while
the
other
trails
behind
the
whole
body
rolling
on
its
axis
with
its
pointed
end
forwards
the
eminent
botanist
de
bary
who
was
not
thinking
of
our
problem
tells
us
in
describing
the
movements
of
these
zoospores
that
as
they
swim
about
foreign
bodies
are
carefully
avoided
and
the
whole
movement
has
a
deceptive
likeness
to
the
voluntary
changes
of
place
which
are
observed
in
microscopic
animals
after
swarming
about
in
this
way
in
the
moisture
on
the
surface
of
a
leaf
or
stem
which
film
though
it
may
be
is
an
ocean
to
such
a
fish
for
half
an
hour
more
or
less
the
movement
of
the
zoospore
becomes
slower
and
is
limited
to
a
slow
turning
upon
its
axis
without
change
of
place
it
then
becomes
quite
quiet
the
cilia
disappear
it
assumes
a
spherical
form
and
surrounds
itself
with
a
distinct
though
delicate
membranous
coat
a
protuberance
then
grows
out
from
one
side
of
the
sphere
and
rapidly
increasing
in
length
assumes
the
character
of
a
hypha
the
latter
penetrates
into
the
substance
of
the
potato
plant
either
by
entering
a
stomate
or
by
boring
through
the
wall
of
an
epidermic
cell
and
ramifies
as
a
mycelium
in
the
substance
of
the
plant
destroying
the
tissues
with
which
it
comes
in
contact
as
these
processes
of
multiplication
take
place
very
rapidly
millions
of
spores
are
soon
set
free
from
a
single
infested
plant
and
from
their
minuteness
they
are
readily
transported
by
the
gentlest
breeze
since
again
the
zoospores
set
free
from
each
spore
in
virtue
of
their
powers
of
locomotion
swiftly
disperse
themselves
over
the
surface
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
infection
once
started
soon
spreads
from
field
to
field
and
extends
its
ravages
over
a
whole
country
however
it
does
not
enter
into
my
present
plan
to
treat
of
the
potato
disease
instructively
as
its
history
bears
upon
that
of
other
epidemics
and
i
have
selected
the
case
of
the
simply
because
it
affords
an
example
of
an
organism
which
in
one
stage
of
its
existence
is
truly
a
monad
indistinguishable
by
any
important
character
from
our
and
extraordinarily
like
it
in
some
respects
and
yet
this
monad
can
be
traced
step
by
step
through
the
series
of
metamorphoses
which
i
have
described
until
it
assumes
the
features
of
an
organism
which
is
as
much
a
plant
as
is
an
oak
or
an
elm
moreover
it
would
be
possible
to
pursue
the
analogy
farther
under
certain
circumstances
a
process
of
conjugation
takes
place
in
the
two
separate
portions
of
its
protoplasm
become
fused
together
surround
themselves
with
a
thick
coat
and
give
rise
to
a
sort
of
vegetable
egg
called
an
after
a
period
of
rest
the
contents
of
the
oospore
break
up
into
a
number
of
zoospores
like
those
already
described
each
of
which
after
a
period
of
activity
germinates
in
the
ordinary
way
this
process
obviously
corresponds
with
the
conjugation
and
subsequent
setting
free
of
germs
in
the
but
it
may
be
said
that
the
is
after
all
a
questionable
sort
of
plant
that
it
seems
to
be
wanting
in
the
manufacturing
power
selected
as
the
main
distinctive
character
of
vegetable
life
or
at
any
rate
that
there
is
no
proof
that
it
does
not
get
its
protein
matter
ready
made
from
the
potato
plant
let
us
therefore
take
a
case
which
is
not
open
to
these
objections
there
are
some
small
plants
known
to
botanists
as
members
of
the
genus
which
without
being
truly
parasitic
grow
upon
certain
as
lichens
grow
upon
trees
the
little
plant
has
the
form
of
an
elegant
green
star
the
branching
arms
of
which
are
divided
into
cells
its
greenness
is
due
to
its
chlorophyll
and
it
undoubtedly
has
the
manufacturing
power
in
full
degree
decomposing
carbonic
acid
and
setting
oxygen
free
under
the
influence
of
sunlight
but
the
protoplasmic
contents
of
some
of
the
cells
of
which
the
plant
is
made
up
occasionally
divide
by
a
method
similar
to
that
which
effects
the
division
of
the
contents
of
the
spore
and
the
severed
portions
are
then
set
free
as
active
zoospores
each
is
oval
and
is
provided
at
one
extremity
with
two
long
active
cilia
propelled
by
these
it
swims
about
for
a
longer
or
shorter
time
but
at
length
comes
to
a
state
of
rest
and
gradually
grows
into
a
moreover
as
in
the
conjugation
may
take
place
and
result
in
an
oospore
the
contents
of
which
divide
and
are
set
free
as
monadiform
germs
if
the
whole
history
of
the
zoospores
of
and
of
were
unknown
they
would
undoubtedly
be
classed
among
monads
with
the
same
right
as
why
then
may
not
be
a
plant
even
though
the
cycle
of
forms
through
which
it
passes
shows
no
terms
quite
so
complex
as
those
which
occur
in
and
and
in
fact
there
are
some
green
organisms
in
every
respect
characteristically
plants
such
as
and
the
common
or
globe
animalcule
which
run
through
a
cycle
of
forms
of
just
the
same
simple
character
as
those
of
the
name
of
is
applied
to
certain
microscopic
green
bodies
each
of
which
consists
of
a
protoplasmic
central
substance
invested
by
a
structureless
sac
the
latter
contains
cellulose
as
in
ordinary
plants
and
the
chlorophyll
which
gives
the
green
colour
enables
the
to
decompose
carbonic
acid
and
fix
carbon
as
they
do
two
long
cilia
protrude
through
the
and
effect
the
rapid
locomotion
of
this
monad
which
in
all
respects
except
its
mobility
is
characteristically
a
plant
under
ordinary
circumstances
the
multiplies
by
simple
fission
each
splitting
into
two
or
into
four
parts
which
separate
and
become
independent
organisms
sometimes
however
the
divides
into
eight
parts
each
of
which
is
provided
with
four
instead
of
two
cilia
these
zoospores
conjugate
in
pairs
and
give
rise
to
quiescent
bodies
which
multiply
by
division
find
eventually
pass
into
the
active
state
thus
so
far
as
outward
form
and
the
general
character
of
the
cycle
of
modifications
through
which
the
organism
passes
in
the
course
of
its
life
are
concerned
the
resemblance
between
and
is
of
the
closest
description
and
on
the
face
of
the
matter
there
is
no
ground
for
refusing
to
admit
that
may
be
related
to
as
the
colourless
fungus
is
to
the
green
alga
may
be
compared
to
a
hollow
sphere
the
wall
of
which
is
made
up
of
coherent
chlamydomonads
and
which
progresses
with
a
rotating
motion
effected
by
the
paddling
of
the
multitudinous
pairs
of
cilia
which
project
from
its
surface
each
moreover
possesses
a
red
pigment
spot
like
the
simplest
form
of
eye
known
among
animals
the
methods
of
fissive
multiplication
and
of
conjugation
observed
in
the
monads
of
this
locomotive
globe
are
essentially
similar
to
those
observed
in
and
though
a
hard
battle
has
been
fought
over
it
is
now
finally
surrendered
to
the
botanists
thus
there
is
really
no
reason
why
may
not
be
a
plant
and
this
conclusion
would
be
very
satisfactory
if
it
were
not
equally
easy
to
show
that
there
is
really
no
reason
why
it
should
not
be
an
animal
for
there
are
numerous
organisms
presenting
the
closest
resemblance
to
and
like
it
grouped
under
the
general
name
of
monads
which
nevertheless
can
be
observed
to
take
in
solid
nutriment
and
which
therefore
have
a
virtual
if
not
an
actual
mouth
and
digestive
cavity
and
thus
come
under
cuvier
definition
of
an
animal
numerous
forms
of
such
animals
have
been
described
by
ehrenberg
dujardin
james
clark
and
other
writers
on
the
indeed
in
another
infusion
of
hay
in
which
my
occurred
there
were
innumerable
such
infusorial
animalcules
belonging
to
the
species
footnote
excellently
described
by
stein
almost
all
of
whose
statements
i
have
verified
specimens
of
this
animalcule
attain
a
length
of
between
or
of
an
inch
so
that
it
may
have
ten
times
the
length
and
a
thousand
times
the
mass
of
a
in
shape
it
is
not
altogether
unlike
the
small
end
however
is
not
produced
into
one
long
cilium
but
the
general
surface
of
the
body
is
covered
with
small
actively
vibrating
ciliary
organs
which
are
only
longest
at
the
small
end
at
the
point
which
answers
to
that
from
which
the
two
cilia
arise
in
there
is
a
conical
depression
the
mouth
and
in
young
specimens
a
tapering
filament
which
reminds
one
of
the
posterior
cilium
of
projects
from
this
region
the
body
consists
of
a
soft
granular
protoplasmic
substance
the
middle
of
which
is
occupied
by
a
large
oval
mass
called
the
nucleus
while
at
its
hinder
end
is
a
contractile
vacuole
conspicuous
by
its
regular
rhythmic
appearances
and
disappearances
obviously
although
the
is
not
a
monad
it
differs
from
one
only
in
subordinate
details
moreover
under
certain
conditions
it
becomes
quiescent
incloses
itself
in
a
delicate
case
or
and
then
divides
into
two
four
or
more
portions
which
are
eventually
set
free
and
swim
about
as
active
but
this
creature
is
an
unmistakable
animal
and
may
be
fed
as
easily
as
one
feeds
chickens
it
is
only
needful
to
diffuse
very
finely
ground
carmine
through
the
water
in
which
they
live
and
in
a
very
short
time
the
bodies
of
the
are
stuffed
with
the
granules
of
the
pigment
and
if
this
were
not
sufficient
evidence
of
the
animality
of
there
comes
the
fact
that
it
is
even
more
similar
to
another
animalcule
than
it
is
to
a
monad
but
is
so
huge
a
creature
compared
with
those
hitherto
discussed
it
reaches
of
an
inch
or
more
in
length
that
there
is
no
difficulty
in
making
out
its
organisation
in
detail
and
in
proving
that
it
is
not
only
an
animal
but
that
it
is
an
animal
which
possesses
a
somewhat
complicated
organisation
for
example
the
surface
layer
of
its
body
is
different
in
structure
from
the
deeper
parts
there
are
two
contractile
vacuoles
from
each
of
which
radiates
a
system
of
canals
and
not
only
is
there
a
conical
depression
continuous
with
a
tube
which
serve
as
mouth
and
gullet
but
the
food
ingested
takes
a
definite
course
and
refuse
is
rejected
from
a
definite
region
nothing
is
easier
than
to
feed
these
animals
and
to
watch
the
particles
of
indigo
or
carmine
accumulate
at
the
lower
end
of
the
gullet
from
this
they
gradually
project
surrounded
by
a
ball
of
water
which
at
length
passes
with
a
jerk
oddly
simulating
a
gulp
into
the
pulpy
central
substance
of
the
body
there
to
circulate
up
one
side
and
down
the
other
until
its
contents
are
digested
and
assimilated
nevertheless
this
complex
animal
multiplies
by
division
as
the
monad
does
and
like
the
monad
undergoes
conjugation
it
stands
in
the
same
relation
to
on
the
animal
side
as
does
on
the
plant
side
start
from
either
and
such
an
insensible
series
of
gradations
leads
to
the
monad
that
it
is
impossible
to
say
at
any
stage
of
the
progress
where
the
line
between
the
animal
and
the
plant
must
be
drawn
there
is
reason
to
think
that
certain
organisms
which
pass
through
a
monad
stage
of
existence
such
as
the
are
at
one
time
of
their
lives
dependent
upon
external
sources
for
their
protein
matter
or
are
animals
and
at
another
period
manufacture
it
or
are
plants
and
seeing
that
the
whole
progress
of
modern
investigation
is
in
favour
of
the
doctrine
of
continuity
it
is
a
fair
and
probable
speculation
though
only
a
speculation
that
as
there
are
some
plants
which
can
manufacture
protein
out
of
such
apparently
intractable
mineral
matters
as
carbonic
acid
water
nitrate
of
ammonia
metallic
and
earthy
salts
while
others
need
to
be
supplied
with
their
carbon
and
nitrogen
in
the
somewhat
less
raw
form
of
tartrate
of
ammonia
and
allied
compounds
so
there
may
be
yet
others
as
is
possibly
the
case
with
the
true
parasitic
plants
which
can
only
manage
to
put
together
materials
still
better
prepared
still
more
nearly
approximated
to
protein
until
we
arrive
at
such
organisms
as
the
and
the
which
are
as
much
animal
as
vegetable
in
structure
but
are
animal
in
their
dependence
on
other
organisms
for
their
food
the
singular
circumstance
observed
by
meyer
that
the
of
yeast
though
an
indubitable
plant
still
flourishes
most
vigorously
when
supplied
with
the
complex
nitrogenous
substance
pepsin
the
probability
that
the
is
nourished
directly
by
the
protoplasm
of
the
and
the
wonderful
facts
which
have
recently
been
brought
to
light
respecting
insectivorous
plants
all
favour
this
view
and
tend
to
the
conclusion
that
the
difference
between
animal
and
plant
is
one
of
degree
rather
than
of
kind
and
that
the
problem
whether
in
a
given
case
an
organism
is
an
animal
or
a
plant
may
be
essentially
insoluble
vii
a
lobster
or
the
study
of
zoology
natural
history
is
the
name
familiarly
applied
to
the
study
of
the
properties
of
such
natural
bodies
as
minerals
plants
and
animals
the
sciences
which
embody
the
knowledge
man
has
acquired
upon
these
subjects
are
commonly
termed
natural
sciences
in
contradistinction
to
other
called
physical
sciences
and
those
who
devote
themselves
especially
to
the
pursuit
of
such
sciences
have
been
and
are
commonly
termed
naturalists
linnaeus
was
a
naturalist
in
this
wide
sense
and
his
systema
naturae
was
a
work
upon
natural
history
in
the
broadest
acceptation
of
the
term
in
it
that
great
methodising
spirit
embodied
all
that
was
known
in
his
time
of
the
distinctive
characters
of
minerals
animals
and
plants
but
the
enormous
stimulus
which
linnaeus
gave
to
the
investigation
of
nature
soon
rendered
it
impossible
that
any
one
man
should
write
another
systema
naturae
and
extremely
difficult
for
any
one
to
become
even
a
naturalist
such
as
linnaeus
was
great
as
have
been
the
advances
made
by
all
the
three
branches
of
science
of
old
included
under
the
title
of
natural
history
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
zoology
and
botany
have
grown
in
an
enormously
greater
ratio
than
mineralogy
and
hence
as
i
suppose
the
name
of
natural
history
has
gradually
become
more
and
more
definitely
attached
to
these
prominent
divisions
of
the
subject
and
by
naturalist
people
have
meant
more
and
more
distinctly
to
imply
a
student
of
the
structure
and
function
of
living
beings
however
this
may
be
it
is
certain
that
the
advance
of
knowledge
has
gradually
widened
the
distance
between
mineralogy
and
its
old
associates
while
it
has
drawn
zoology
and
botany
closer
together
so
that
of
late
years
it
has
been
found
convenient
and
indeed
necessary
to
associate
the
sciences
which
deal
with
vitality
and
all
its
phenomena
under
the
common
head
of
biology
and
the
biologists
have
come
to
repudiate
any
with
their
the
mineralogists
certain
broad
laws
have
a
general
application
throughout
both
the
animal
and
the
vegetable
worlds
but
the
ground
common
to
these
kingdoms
of
nature
is
not
of
very
wide
extent
and
the
multiplicity
of
details
is
so
great
that
the
student
of
living
beings
finds
himself
obliged
to
devote
his
attention
exclusively
either
to
the
one
or
the
other
if
he
elects
to
study
plants
under
any
aspect
we
know
at
once
what
to
call
him
he
is
a
botanist
and
his
science
is
botany
but
if
the
investigation
of
animal
life
be
his
choice
the
name
generally
applied
to
him
will
vary
according
to
the
kind
of
animals
he
studies
or
the
particular
phenomena
of
animal
life
to
which
he
confines
his
attention
if
the
study
of
man
is
his
object
he
is
called
an
anatomist
or
a
physiologist
or
an
ethnologist
but
if
he
dissects
animals
or
examines
into
the
mode
in
which
their
functions
are
performed
he
is
a
comparative
anatomist
or
comparative
physiologist
if
he
turns
his
attention
to
fossil
animals
he
is
a
palaeontologist
if
his
mind
is
more
particularly
directed
to
the
specific
description
discrimination
classification
and
distribution
of
animals
he
is
termed
a
zoologist
for
the
purpose
of
the
present
discourse
however
i
shall
recognise
none
of
these
titles
save
the
last
which
i
shall
employ
as
the
equivalent
of
botanist
and
i
shall
use
the
term
zoology
is
denoting
the
whole
doctrine
of
animal
life
in
contradistinction
to
botany
which
signifies
the
whole
doctrine
of
vegetable
life
employed
in
this
sense
zoology
like
botany
is
divisible
into
three
great
but
subordinate
sciences
morphology
physiology
and
distribution
each
of
which
may
to
a
very
great
extent
be
studied
independently
of
the
other
zoological
morphology
is
the
doctrine
of
animal
form
or
structure
anatomy
is
one
of
its
branches
development
is
another
while
classification
is
the
expression
of
the
relations
which
different
animals
bear
to
one
another
in
respect
of
their
anatomy
and
their
development
zoological
distribution
is
the
study
of
animals
in
relation
to
the
terrestrial
conditions
which
obtain
now
or
have
obtained
at
any
previous
epoch
of
the
earth
history
zoological
physiology
lastly
is
the
doctrine
of
the
functions
or
actions
of
animals
it
regards
animal
bodies
as
machines
impelled
by
certain
forces
and
performing
an
amount
of
work
which
can
be
expressed
in
terms
of
the
ordinary
forces
of
nature
the
final
object
of
physiology
is
to
deduce
the
facts
of
morphology
on
the
one
hand
and
those
of
distribution
on
the
other
from
the
laws
of
the
molecular
forces
of
matter
such
is
the
scope
of
zoology
but
if
i
were
to
content
myself
with
the
enunciation
of
these
dry
definitions
i
should
ill
exemplify
that
method
of
teaching
this
branch
of
physical
science
which
it
is
my
chief
business
to
recommend
let
us
turn
away
then
from
abstract
definitions
let
us
take
some
concrete
living
thing
some
animal
the
commoner
the
better
and
let
us
see
how
the
application
of
common
sense
and
common
logic
to
the
obvious
facts
it
presents
inevitably
leads
us
into
all
these
branches
of
zoological
science
i
have
before
me
a
lobster
when
i
examine
it
what
appears
to
be
the
most
striking
character
it
presents
why
i
observe
that
this
part
which
we
call
the
tail
of
the
lobster
is
made
up
of
six
distinct
hard
rings
and
a
seventh
terminal
piece
if
i
separate
one
of
the
middle
rings
say
the
third
i
find
it
carries
upon
its
under
surface
a
pair
of
limbs
or
appendages
each
of
which
consists
of
a
stalk
and
two
terminal
pieces
so
that
i
can
represent
a
transverse
section
of
the
ring
and
its
appendages
upon
the
diagram
board
in
this
way
if
i
now
take
the
fourth
ring
i
find
it
has
the
same
structure
and
so
have
the
fifth
and
the
second
so
that
in
each
of
these
divisions
of
the
tail
i
find
parts
which
correspond
with
one
another
a
ring
and
two
appendages
and
in
each
appendage
a
stalk
and
two
end
pieces
these
corresponding
parts
are
called
in
the
technical
language
of
anatomy
homologous
parts
the
ring
of
the
third
division
is
the
homologue
of
the
ring
of
the
fifth
the
appendage
of
the
former
is
the
homologue
of
the
appendage
of
the
latter
and
as
each
division
exhibits
corresponding
parts
in
corresponding
places
we
say
that
all
the
divisions
are
constructed
upon
the
same
plan
but
now
let
us
consider
the
sixth
division
it
is
similar
to
and
yet
different
from
the
others
the
ring
is
essentially
the
same
as
in
the
other
divisions
but
the
appendages
look
at
first
as
if
they
were
very
different
and
yet
when
we
regard
them
closely
what
do
we
find
a
stalk
and
two
terminal
divisions
exactly
as
in
the
others
but
the
stalk
is
very
short
and
very
thick
the
terminal
divisions
are
very
broad
and
flat
and
one
of
them
is
divided
into
two
pieces
i
may
say
therefore
that
the
sixth
segment
is
like
the
others
in
plan
but
that
it
is
modified
in
its
details
the
first
segment
is
like
the
others
so
far
as
its
ring
is
concerned
and
though
its
appendages
differ
from
any
of
those
yet
examined
in
the
simplicity
of
their
structure
parts
corresponding
with
the
stem
and
one
of
the
divisions
of
the
appendages
of
the
other
segments
can
be
readily
discerned
in
them
thus
it
appears
that
the
lobster
tail
is
composed
of
a
series
of
segments
which
are
fundamentally
similar
though
each
presents
peculiar
modifications
of
the
plan
common
to
all
but
when
i
turn
to
the
forepart
of
the
body
i
see
at
first
nothing
but
a
great
shell
called
technically
the
carapace
ending
in
front
in
a
sharp
spine
on
either
side
of
which
are
the
curious
compound
eyes
set
upon
the
ends
of
stout
movable
stalks
behind
these
on
the
under
side
of
the
body
are
two
pairs
of
long
feelers
or
antennae
followed
by
six
pairs
of
jaws
folded
against
one
another
over
the
mouth
and
five
pairs
of
legs
the
foremost
of
these
being
the
great
pinchers
or
claws
of
the
lobster
it
looks
at
first
a
little
hopeless
to
attempt
to
find
in
this
complex
mass
a
series
of
rings
each
with
its
pair
of
appendages
such
as
i
have
shown
you
in
the
abdomen
and
yet
it
is
not
difficult
to
demonstrate
their
existence
strip
off
the
legs
and
you
will
find
that
each
pair
is
attached
to
a
very
definite
segment
of
the
under
wall
of
the
body
but
these
segments
instead
of
being
the
lower
parts
of
free
rings
as
in
the
tail
are
such
parts
of
rings
which
are
all
solidly
united
and
bound
together
and
the
like
is
true
of
the
jaws
the
feelers
and
the
stalks
every
pair
of
which
is
borne
upon
its
own
special
segment
thus
the
conclusion
is
gradually
forced
upon
us
that
the
body
of
the
lobster
is
composed
of
as
many
rings
as
there
are
pairs
of
appendages
namely
twenty
in
all
but
that
the
six
hindmost
rings
remain
free
and
movable
while
the
fourteen
front
rings
become
firmly
soldered
together
their
backs
forming
one
continuous
shield
the
carapace
unity
of
plan
diversity
in
execution
is
the
lesson
taught
by
the
study
of
the
rings
of
the
body
and
the
same
instruction
is
given
still
more
emphatically
by
the
appendages
if
i
examine
the
outermost
jaw
i
find
it
consists
of
three
distinct
portions
an
inner
a
middle
and
an
outer
mounted
upon
a
common
stem
and
if
i
compare
this
jaw
with
the
legs
behind
it
or
the
jaws
in
front
of
it
i
find
it
quite
easy
to
see
that
in
the
legs
it
is
the
part
of
the
appendage
which
corresponds
with
the
inner
division
which
becomes
modified
into
what
we
know
familiarly
as
the
leg
while
the
middle
division
disappears
and
the
outer
division
is
hidden
under
the
carapace
nor
is
it
more
difficult
to
discern
that
in
the
appendages
of
the
tail
the
middle
division
appears
again
and
the
outer
vanishes
while
on
the
other
hand
in
the
foremost
jaw
the
called
mandible
the
inner
division
only
is
left
and
in
the
same
way
the
parts
of
the
feelers
and
of
the
can
be
identified
with
those
of
the
legs
and
jaws
but
whither
does
all
this
tend
to
the
very
remarkable
conclusion
that
a
unity
of
plan
of
the
same
kind
as
that
discoverable
in
the
tail
or
abdomen
of
the
lobster
pervades
the
whole
organisation
of
its
skeleton
so
that
i
can
return
to
the
diagram
representing
any
one
of
the
rings
of
the
tail
which
i
drew
upon
the
board
and
by
adding
a
third
division
to
each
appendage
i
can
use
it
as
a
sort
of
scheme
or
plan
of
any
ring
of
the
body
i
can
give
names
to
all
the
parts
of
that
figure
and
then
if
i
take
any
segment
of
the
body
of
the
lobster
i
can
point
out
to
you
exactly
what
modification
the
general
plan
has
undergone
in
that
particular
segment
what
part
has
remained
movable
and
what
has
become
fixed
to
another
what
has
been
excessively
developed
and
metamorphosed
and
what
has
been
suppressed
but
i
imagine
i
hear
the
question
how
is
all
this
to
be
tested
no
doubt
it
is
a
pretty
and
ingenious
way
of
looking
at
the
structure
of
any
animal
but
is
it
anything
more
does
nature
acknowledge
in
any
deeper
way
this
unity
of
plan
we
seem
to
trace
the
objection
suggested
by
these
questions
is
a
very
valid
and
important
one
and
morphology
was
in
an
unsound
state
so
long
as
it
rested
upon
the
mere
perception
of
the
analogies
which
obtain
between
fully
formed
parts
the
unchecked
ingenuity
of
speculative
anatomists
proved
itself
fully
competent
to
spin
any
number
of
contradictory
hypotheses
out
of
the
same
facts
and
endless
morphological
dreams
threatened
to
supplant
scientific
theory
happily
however
there
is
a
criterion
of
morphological
truth
and
a
sure
test
of
all
homologies
our
lobster
has
not
always
been
what
we
see
it
it
was
once
an
egg
a
semifluid
mass
of
yolk
not
so
big
as
a
pin
head
contained
in
a
transparent
membrane
and
exhibiting
not
the
least
trace
of
any
one
of
those
organs
the
multiplicity
and
complexity
of
which
in
the
adult
are
so
surprising
after
a
time
a
delicate
patch
of
cellular
membrane
appeared
upon
one
face
of
this
yolk
and
that
patch
was
the
foundation
of
the
whole
creature
the
clay
out
of
which
it
would
be
moulded
gradually
investing
the
yolk
it
became
subdivided
by
transverse
constrictions
into
segments
the
forerunners
of
the
rings
of
the
body
upon
the
ventral
surface
of
each
of
the
rings
thus
sketched
out
a
pair
of
prominences
made
their
appearance
the
rudiments
of
the
appendages
of
the
ring
at
first
all
the
appendages
were
alike
but
as
they
grew
most
of
them
became
distinguished
into
a
stem
and
two
terminal
divisions
to
which
in
the
middle
part
of
the
body
was
added
a
third
outer
division
and
it
was
only
at
a
later
period
that
by
the
modification
or
absorption
of
certain
of
these
primitive
constituents
the
limbs
acquired
their
perfect
form
thus
the
study
of
development
proves
that
the
doctrine
of
unity
of
plan
is
not
merely
a
fancy
that
it
is
not
merely
one
way
of
looking
at
the
matter
but
that
it
is
the
expression
of
natural
facts
the
legs
and
jaws
of
the
lobster
may
not
merely
be
regarded
as
modifications
of
a
common
type
in
fact
and
in
nature
they
are
so
the
leg
and
the
jaw
of
the
young
animal
being
at
first
indistinguishable
these
are
wonderful
truths
the
more
so
because
the
zoologist
finds
them
to
be
of
universal
application
the
investigation
of
a
polype
of
a
snail
of
a
fish
of
a
horse
or
of
a
man
would
have
led
us
though
by
a
less
easy
path
perhaps
to
exactly
the
same
point
unity
of
plan
everywhere
lies
hidden
under
the
mask
of
diversity
of
structure
the
complex
is
everywhere
evolved
out
of
the
simple
every
animal
has
at
first
the
form
of
an
egg
and
every
animal
and
every
organic
part
in
reaching
its
adult
state
passes
through
conditions
common
to
other
animals
and
other
adult
parts
and
this
leads
me
to
another
point
i
have
hitherto
spoken
as
if
the
lobster
were
alone
in
the
world
but
as
i
need
hardly
remind
you
there
are
myriads
of
other
animal
organisms
of
these
some
such
as
men
horses
birds
fishes
snails
slugs
oysters
corals
and
sponges
are
not
in
the
least
like
the
lobster
but
other
animals
though
they
may
differ
a
good
deal
from
the
lobster
are
yet
either
very
like
it
or
are
like
something
that
is
like
it
the
cray
fish
the
rock
lobster
and
the
prawn
and
the
shrimp
for
example
however
different
are
yet
so
like
lobsters
that
a
child
would
group
them
as
of
the
lobster
kind
in
contradistinction
to
snails
and
slugs
and
these
last
again
would
form
a
kind
by
themselves
in
contradistinction
to
cows
horses
and
sheep
the
cattle
kind
but
this
spontaneous
grouping
into
kinds
is
the
first
essay
of
the
human
mind
at
classification
or
the
calling
by
a
common
name
of
those
things
that
are
alike
and
the
arranging
them
in
such
a
manner
as
best
to
suggest
the
sum
of
their
likenesses
and
unlikenesses
to
other
things
those
kinds
which
include
no
other
subdivisions
than
the
sexes
or
various
breeds
are
called
in
technical
language
species
the
english
lobster
is
a
species
our
cray
fish
is
another
our
prawn
is
another
in
other
countries
however
there
are
lobsters
cray
fish
and
prawns
very
like
ours
and
yet
presenting
sufficient
differences
to
deserve
distinction
naturalists
therefore
express
this
resemblance
and
this
diversity
by
grouping
them
as
distinct
species
of
the
same
genus
but
the
lobster
and
the
cray
fish
though
belonging
to
distinct
genera
have
many
features
in
common
and
hence
are
grouped
together
in
an
assemblage
which
is
called
a
family
more
distant
resemblances
connect
the
lobster
with
the
prawn
and
the
crab
which
are
expressed
by
putting
all
these
into
the
same
order
again
more
remote
but
still
very
definite
resemblances
unite
the
lobster
with
the
woodlouse
the
king
crab
the
water
flea
and
the
barnacle
and
separate
them
from
all
other
animals
whence
they
collectively
constitute
the
larger
group
or
class
but
the
exhibit
many
peculiar
features
in
common
with
insects
spiders
and
centipedes
so
that
these
are
grouped
into
the
still
larger
assemblage
or
province
and
finally
the
relations
which
these
have
to
worms
and
other
lower
animals
are
expressed
by
combining
the
whole
vast
aggregate
into
the
of
if
i
had
worked
my
way
from
a
sponge
instead
of
a
lobster
i
should
have
found
it
associated
by
like
ties
with
a
great
number
of
other
animals
into
the
if
i
had
selected
a
polype
or
a
coral
the
members
of
what
naturalists
term
the
would
have
grouped
themselves
around
my
type
had
a
snail
been
chosen
the
inhabitants
of
all
univalve
and
bivalve
land
and
water
shells
the
lamp
shells
the
squids
and
the
would
have
gradually
linked
themselves
on
to
it
as
members
of
the
same
of
and
finally
starting
from
man
i
should
have
been
compelled
to
admit
first
the
ape
the
rat
the
horse
the
dog
into
the
same
class
and
then
the
bird
the
crocodile
the
turtle
the
frog
and
the
fish
into
the
same
of
and
if
i
had
followed
out
all
these
various
lines
of
classification
fully
i
should
discover
in
the
end
that
there
was
no
animal
either
recent
or
fossil
which
did
not
at
once
fall
into
one
or
other
of
these
in
other
words
every
animal
is
organised
upon
one
or
other
of
the
five
or
more
plans
the
existence
of
which
renders
our
classification
possible
and
so
definitely
and
precisely
marked
is
the
structure
of
each
animal
that
in
the
present
state
of
our
knowledge
there
is
not
the
least
evidence
to
prove
that
a
form
in
the
slightest
degree
transitional
between
any
of
the
two
groups
annulosa
and
either
exists
or
has
existed
during
that
period
of
the
earth
history
which
is
recorded
by
the
geologist
nevertheless
you
must
not
for
a
moment
suppose
because
no
such
transitional
forms
are
known
that
the
members
of
the
are
disconnected
from
or
independent
of
one
another
on
the
contrary
in
their
earliest
condition
they
are
all
similar
and
the
primordial
germs
of
a
man
a
dog
a
bird
a
fish
a
beetle
a
snail
and
a
polype
are
in
no
essential
structural
respects
distinguishable
footnote
the
different
grouping
necessitated
by
later
knowledge
does
not
affect
the
principle
of
the
in
this
broad
sense
it
may
with
truth
be
said
that
all
living
animals
and
all
those
dead
faunae
which
geology
reveals
are
bound
together
by
an
unity
of
organisation
of
the
same
character
though
not
equal
in
degree
to
that
which
enables
us
to
discern
one
and
the
same
plan
amidst
the
twenty
different
segments
of
a
lobster
body
truly
it
has
been
said
that
to
a
clear
eye
the
smallest
fact
is
a
window
through
which
the
infinite
may
be
seen
turning
from
these
purely
morphological
considerations
let
us
now
examine
into
the
manner
in
which
the
attentive
study
of
the
lobster
impels
us
into
other
lines
of
research
lobsters
are
found
in
all
the
european
seas
but
on
the
opposite
shores
of
the
atlantic
and
in
the
seas
of
the
southern
hemisphere
they
do
not
exist
they
are
however
represented
in
these
regions
by
very
closely
allied
but
distinct
forms
the
and
the
capensis
so
that
we
may
say
that
the
european
has
one
species
of
the
american
another
the
african
another
and
thus
the
remarkable
facts
of
geographical
distribution
begin
to
dawn
upon
us
again
if
we
examine
the
contents
of
the
earth
crust
we
shall
find
in
the
latter
of
those
deposits
which
have
served
as
the
great
burying
grounds
of
past
ages
numberless
animals
but
none
so
similar
to
our
living
lobster
as
to
make
zoologists
sure
that
they
belonged
even
to
the
same
genus
if
we
go
still
further
back
in
time
we
discover
in
the
oldest
rocks
of
all
the
remains
of
animals
constructed
on
the
same
general
plan
as
the
lobster
and
belonging
to
the
same
great
group
of
but
for
the
most
part
totally
different
from
the
lobster
and
indeed
from
any
other
living
form
of
crustacean
and
thus
we
gain
a
notion
of
that
successive
change
of
the
animal
population
of
the
globe
in
past
ages
which
is
the
most
striking
fact
revealed
by
geology
consider
now
where
our
inquiries
have
led
us
we
studied
our
type
morphologically
when
we
determined
its
anatomy
and
its
development
and
when
comparing
it
in
these
respects
with
other
animals
we
made
out
its
place
in
a
system
of
classification
if
we
were
to
examine
every
animal
in
a
similar
manner
we
should
establish
a
complete
body
of
zoological
morphology
again
we
investigated
the
distribution
of
our
type
in
space
and
in
time
and
if
the
like
had
been
done
with
every
animal
the
sciences
of
geographical
and
geological
distribution
would
have
attained
their
limit
but
you
will
observe
one
remarkable
circumstance
that
up
to
this
point
the
question
of
the
life
of
these
organisms
has
not
come
under
consideration
morphology
and
distribution
might
be
studied
almost
as
well
if
animals
and
plants
were
a
peculiar
kind
of
crystals
and
possessed
none
of
those
functions
which
distinguish
living
beings
so
remarkably
but
the
facts
of
morphology
and
distribution
have
to
be
accounted
for
and
the
science
the
aim
of
which
it
is
to
account
for
them
is
physiology
let
us
return
to
our
lobster
once
more
if
we
watched
the
creature
in
its
native
element
we
should
see
it
climbing
actively
the
submerged
rocks
among
which
it
delights
to
live
by
means
of
its
strong
legs
or
swimming
by
powerful
strokes
of
its
great
tail
the
appendages
of
the
sixth
joint
of
which
are
spread
out
into
a
broad
propeller
seize
it
and
it
will
show
you
that
its
great
claws
are
no
mean
weapons
of
offence
suspend
a
piece
of
carrion
among
its
haunts
and
it
will
greedily
devour
it
tearing
and
crushing
the
flesh
by
means
of
its
multitudinous
jaws
suppose
that
we
had
known
nothing
of
the
lobster
but
as
an
inert
mass
an
organic
crystal
if
i
may
use
the
phrase
and
that
we
could
suddenly
see
it
exerting
all
these
powers
what
wonderful
new
ideas
and
new
questions
would
arise
in
our
minds
the
great
new
question
would
be
how
does
all
this
take
place
the
chief
new
idea
would
be
the
idea
of
adaptation
to
purpose
the
notion
that
the
constituents
of
animal
bodies
are
not
mere
unconnected
parts
but
organs
working
together
to
an
end
let
us
consider
the
tail
of
the
lobster
again
from
this
point
of
view
morphology
has
taught
us
that
it
is
a
series
of
segments
composed
of
homologous
parts
which
undergo
various
modifications
beneath
and
through
which
a
common
plan
of
formation
is
discernible
but
if
i
look
at
the
same
part
physiologically
i
see
that
it
is
a
most
beautifully
constructed
organ
of
locomotion
by
means
of
which
the
animal
can
swiftly
propel
itself
either
backwards
or
forwards
but
how
is
this
remarkable
propulsive
machine
made
to
perform
its
functions
if
i
were
suddenly
to
kill
one
of
these
animals
and
to
take
out
all
the
soft
parts
i
should
find
the
shell
to
be
perfectly
inert
to
have
no
more
power
of
moving
itself
than
is
possessed
by
the
machinery
of
a
mill
when
disconnected
from
its
or
but
if
i
were
to
open
it
and
take
out
the
viscera
only
leaving
the
white
flesh
i
should
perceive
that
the
lobster
could
bend
and
extend
its
tail
as
well
as
before
if
i
were
to
cut
off
the
tail
i
should
cease
to
find
any
spontaneous
motion
in
it
but
on
pinching
any
portion
of
the
flesh
i
should
observe
that
it
underwent
a
very
curious
change
each
fibre
becoming
shorter
and
thicker
by
this
act
of
contraction
as
it
is
termed
the
parts
to
which
the
ends
of
the
fibre
are
attached
are
of
course
approximated
and
according
to
the
relations
of
their
points
of
attachment
to
the
centres
of
motions
of
the
different
rings
the
bending
or
the
extension
of
the
tail
results
close
observation
of
the
opened
lobster
would
soon
show
that
all
its
movements
are
due
to
the
same
cause
the
shortening
and
thickening
of
these
fleshy
fibres
which
are
technically
called
muscles
here
then
is
a
capital
fact
the
movements
of
the
lobster
are
due
to
muscular
contractility
but
why
does
a
muscle
contract
at
one
time
and
not
at
another
why
does
one
whole
group
of
muscles
contract
when
the
lobster
wishes
to
extend
his
tail
and
another
group
when
he
desires
to
bend
it
what
is
it
originates
directs
and
controls
the
motive
power
experiment
the
great
instrument
for
the
ascertainment
of
truth
in
physical
science
answers
this
question
for
us
in
the
head
of
the
lobster
there
lies
a
small
mass
of
that
peculiar
tissue
which
is
known
as
nervous
substance
cords
of
similar
matter
connect
his
brain
of
the
lobster
directly
or
indirectly
with
the
muscles
now
if
these
communicating
cords
are
cut
the
brain
remaining
entire
the
power
of
exerting
what
we
call
voluntary
motion
in
the
parts
below
the
section
is
destroyed
and
on
the
other
hand
if
the
cords
remaining
entire
the
brain
mass
be
destroyed
the
same
voluntary
mobility
is
equally
lost
whence
the
inevitable
conclusion
is
that
the
power
of
originating
these
motions
resides
in
the
brain
and
is
propagated
along
the
nervous
cords
in
the
higher
animals
the
phenomena
which
attend
this
transmission
have
been
investigated
and
the
exertion
of
the
peculiar
energy
which
resides
in
the
nerves
has
been
found
to
be
accompanied
by
a
disturbance
of
the
electrical
state
of
their
molecules
if
we
could
exactly
estimate
the
signification
of
this
disturbance
if
we
could
obtain
the
value
of
a
given
exertion
of
nerve
force
by
determining
the
quantity
of
electricity
or
of
heat
of
which
it
is
the
equivalent
if
we
could
ascertain
upon
what
arrangement
or
other
condition
of
the
molecules
of
matter
the
manifestation
of
the
nervous
and
muscular
energies
depends
and
doubtless
science
will
some
day
or
other
ascertain
these
points
physiologists
would
have
attained
their
ultimate
goal
in
this
direction
they
would
have
determined
the
relation
of
the
motive
force
of
animals
to
the
other
forms
of
force
found
in
nature
and
if
the
same
process
had
been
successfully
performed
for
all
the
operations
which
are
carried
on
in
and
by
the
animal
frame
physiology
would
be
perfect
and
the
facts
of
morphology
and
distribution
would
be
deducible
from
the
laws
which
physiologists
had
established
combined
with
those
determining
the
condition
of
the
surrounding
universe
there
is
not
a
fragment
of
the
organism
of
this
humble
animal
whose
study
would
not
lead
us
into
regions
of
thought
as
large
as
those
which
i
have
briefly
opened
up
to
you
but
what
i
have
been
saying
i
trust
has
not
only
enabled
you
to
form
a
conception
of
the
scope
and
purport
of
zoology
but
has
given
you
an
imperfect
example
of
the
manner
in
which
in
my
opinion
that
science
or
indeed
any
physical
science
may
be
best
taught
the
great
matter
is
to
make
teaching
real
and
practical
by
fixing
the
attention
of
the
student
on
particular
facts
but
at
the
same
time
it
should
be
rendered
broad
and
comprehensive
by
constant
reference
to
the
generalisations
of
which
all
particular
facts
are
illustrations
the
lobster
has
served
as
a
type
of
the
whole
animal
kingdom
and
its
anatomy
and
physiology
have
illustrated
for
us
some
of
the
greatest
truths
of
biology
the
student
who
has
once
seen
for
himself
the
facts
which
i
have
described
has
had
their
relations
explained
to
him
and
has
clearly
comprehended
them
has
so
far
a
knowledge
of
zoology
which
is
real
and
genuine
however
limited
it
may
be
and
which
is
worth
more
than
all
the
mere
reading
knowledge
of
the
science
he
could
ever
acquire
his
zoological
information
is
so
far
knowledge
and
not
mere
hearsay
and
if
it
were
nay
business
to
fit
you
for
the
certificate
in
zoological
science
granted
by
this
department
i
should
pursue
a
course
precisely
similar
in
principle
to
that
which
i
have
taken
i
should
select
a
sponge
a
polype
or
a
a
mussel
a
lobster
a
fowl
as
types
of
the
five
primary
divisions
of
the
animal
kingdom
i
should
explain
their
structure
very
fully
and
show
how
each
illustrated
the
great
principles
of
zoology
having
gone
very
carefully
and
fully
over
this
ground
i
should
feel
that
you
had
a
safe
foundation
and
i
should
then
take
you
in
the
same
way
but
less
minutely
over
similarly
selected
illustrative
types
of
the
classes
and
then
i
should
direct
your
attention
to
the
special
forms
enumerated
under
the
head
of
types
in
this
syllabus
and
to
the
other
facts
there
mentioned
that
would
speaking
generally
be
my
plan
but
i
have
undertaken
to
explain
to
you
the
best
mode
of
acquiring
and
communicating
a
knowledge
of
zoology
and
you
may
therefore
fairly
ask
me
for
a
more
detailed
and
precise
account
of
the
manner
in
which
i
should
propose
to
furnish
you
with
the
information
i
refer
to
my
own
impression
is
that
the
best
model
for
all
kinds
of
training
in
physical
science
is
that
afforded
by
the
method
of
teaching
anatomy
in
use
in
the
medical
schools
this
method
consists
of
three
elements
lectures
demonstrations
and
examinations
the
object
of
lectures
is
in
the
first
place
to
awaken
the
attention
and
excite
the
enthusiasm
of
the
student
and
this
i
am
sure
may
be
effected
to
a
far
greater
extent
by
the
oral
discourse
and
by
the
personal
influence
of
a
respected
teacher
than
in
any
other
way
secondly
lectures
have
the
double
use
of
guiding
the
student
to
the
salient
points
of
a
subject
and
at
the
same
time
forcing
him
to
attend
to
the
whole
of
it
and
not
merely
to
that
part
which
takes
his
fancy
and
lastly
lectures
afford
the
student
the
opportunity
of
seeking
explanations
of
those
difficulties
which
will
and
indeed
ought
to
arise
in
the
course
of
his
studies
what
books
shall
i
read
is
a
question
constantly
put
by
the
student
to
the
teacher
my
reply
usually
is
none
write
your
notes
out
carefully
and
fully
strive
to
understand
them
thoroughly
come
to
me
for
the
explanation
of
anything
you
can
not
understand
and
i
would
rather
you
did
not
distract
your
mind
by
reading
a
properly
composed
course
of
lectures
ought
to
contain
fully
as
much
matter
as
a
student
can
assimilate
in
the
time
occupied
by
its
delivery
and
the
teacher
should
always
recollect
that
his
business
is
to
feed
and
not
to
cram
the
intellect
indeed
i
believe
that
a
student
who
gains
from
a
course
of
lectures
the
simple
habit
of
concentrating
his
attention
upon
a
definitely
limited
series
of
facts
until
they
are
thoroughly
mastered
has
made
a
step
of
immeasurable
importance
but
however
good
lectures
may
be
and
however
extensive
the
course
of
reading
by
which
they
are
followed
up
they
are
but
accessories
to
the
great
instrument
of
scientific
teaching
demonstration
if
i
insist
unweariedly
nay
fanatically
upon
the
importance
of
physical
science
as
an
educational
agent
it
is
because
the
study
of
any
branch
of
science
if
properly
conducted
appears
to
me
to
fill
up
a
void
left
by
all
other
means
of
education
i
have
the
greatest
respect
and
love
for
literature
nothing
would
grieve
me
more
than
to
see
literary
training
other
than
a
very
prominent
branch
of
education
indeed
i
wish
that
real
literary
discipline
were
far
more
attended
to
than
it
is
but
i
can
not
shut
my
eyes
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
men
who
have
had
a
purely
literary
and
those
who
have
had
a
sound
scientific
training
seeking
for
the
cause
of
this
difference
i
imagine
i
can
find
it
in
the
fact
that
in
the
world
of
letters
learning
and
knowledge
are
one
and
books
are
the
source
of
both
whereas
in
science
as
in
life
learning
and
knowledge
are
distinct
and
the
study
of
things
and
not
of
books
is
the
source
of
the
latter
all
that
literature
has
to
bestow
may
be
obtained
by
reading
and
by
practical
exercise
in
writing
and
in
speaking
but
i
do
not
exaggerate
when
i
say
that
none
of
the
best
gifts
of
science
are
to
be
won
by
these
means
on
the
contrary
the
great
benefit
which
a
scientific
education
bestows
whether
is
training
or
as
knowledge
is
dependent
upon
the
extent
to
which
the
mind
of
the
student
is
brought
into
immediate
contact
with
facts
upon
the
degree
to
which
he
learns
the
habit
of
appealing
directly
to
nature
and
of
acquiring
through
his
senses
concrete
images
of
those
properties
of
things
which
are
and
always
will
be
but
approximatively
expressed
in
human
language
our
way
of
looking
at
nature
and
of
speaking
about
her
varies
from
year
to
year
but
a
fact
once
seen
a
relation
of
cause
and
effect
once
demonstratively
apprehended
are
possessions
which
neither
change
nor
pass
away
but
on
the
contrary
form
fixed
centres
about
which
other
truths
aggregate
by
natural
affinity
therefore
the
great
business
of
the
scientific
teacher
is
to
imprint
the
fundamental
irrefragable
facts
of
his
science
not
only
by
words
upon
the
mind
but
by
sensible
impressions
upon
the
eye
and
ear
and
touch
of
the
student
in
so
complete
a
manner
that
every
term
used
or
law
enunciated
should
afterwards
call
up
vivid
images
of
the
particular
structural
or
other
facts
which
furnished
the
demonstration
of
the
law
or
the
illustration
of
the
term
now
this
important
operation
can
only
be
achieved
by
constant
demonstration
which
may
take
place
to
a
certain
imperfect
extent
during
a
lecture
but
which
ought
also
to
be
carried
on
independently
and
which
should
be
addressed
to
each
individual
student
the
teacher
endeavouring
not
so
much
to
show
a
thing
to
the
learner
as
to
make
him
see
it
for
himself
i
am
well
aware
that
there
are
great
practical
difficulties
in
the
way
of
effectual
zoological
demonstrations
the
dissection
of
animals
is
not
altogether
pleasant
and
requires
much
time
nor
is
it
easy
to
secure
an
adequate
supply
of
the
needful
specimens
the
botanist
has
here
a
great
advantage
his
specimens
are
easily
obtained
are
clean
and
wholesome
and
can
be
dissected
in
a
private
house
as
well
as
anywhere
else
and
hence
i
believe
the
fact
that
botany
is
so
much
more
readily
and
better
taught
than
its
sister
science
but
be
it
difficult
or
be
it
easy
if
zoological
science
is
to
be
properly
studied
demonstration
and
consequently
dissection
must
be
had
without
it
no
man
can
have
a
really
sound
knowledge
of
animal
organisation
a
good
deal
may
be
done
however
without
actual
dissection
on
the
student
part
by
demonstration
upon
specimens
and
preparations
and
in
all
probability
it
would
not
be
very
difficult
were
the
demand
sufficient
to
organise
collections
of
such
objects
sufficient
for
all
the
purposes
of
elementary
teaching
at
a
comparatively
cheap
rate
even
without
these
much
might
be
effected
if
the
zoological
collections
which
are
open
to
the
public
were
arranged
according
to
what
has
been
termed
the
typical
principle
that
is
to
say
if
the
specimens
exposed
to
public
view
were
so
selected
that
the
public
could
learn
something
from
them
instead
of
being
as
at
present
merely
confused
by
their
multiplicity
for
example
the
grand
ornithological
gallery
at
the
british
museum
contains
between
two
and
three
thousand
species
of
birds
and
sometimes
five
or
six
specimens
of
a
species
they
are
very
pretty
to
look
at
and
some
of
the
cases
are
indeed
splendid
but
i
will
undertake
to
say
that
no
man
but
a
professed
ornithologist
has
ever
gathered
much
information
from
the
collection
certainly
no
one
of
the
tens
of
thousands
of
the
general
public
who
have
walked
through
that
gallery
ever
knew
more
about
the
essential
peculiarities
of
birds
when
he
left
the
gallery
than
when
he
entered
it
but
if
somewhere
in
that
vast
hall
there
were
a
few
preparations
exemplifying
the
leading
structural
peculiarities
and
the
mode
of
development
of
a
common
fowl
if
the
types
of
the
genera
the
leading
modifications
in
the
skeleton
in
the
plumage
at
various
ages
in
the
mode
of
nidification
and
the
like
among
birds
were
displayed
and
if
the
other
specimens
were
put
away
in
a
place
where
the
men
of
science
to
whom
they
are
alone
useful
could
have
free
access
to
them
i
can
conceive
that
this
collection
might
become
a
great
instrument
of
scientific
education
the
last
implement
of
the
teacher
to
which
i
have
adverted
is
examination
a
means
of
education
now
so
thoroughly
understood
that
i
need
hardly
enlarge
upon
it
i
hold
that
both
written
and
oral
examinations
are
indispensable
and
by
requiring
the
description
of
specimens
they
may
be
made
to
supplement
demonstration
such
is
the
fullest
reply
the
time
at
my
disposal
will
allow
me
to
give
to
the
question
how
may
a
knowledge
of
zoology
be
best
acquired
and
communicated
but
there
is
a
previous
question
which
may
be
moved
and
which
in
fact
i
know
many
are
inclined
to
move
it
is
the
question
why
should
teachers
be
encouraged
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
this
or
any
other
branch
of
physical
science
what
is
the
use
it
is
said
of
attempting
to
make
physical
science
a
branch
of
primary
education
is
it
not
probable
that
teachers
in
pursuing
such
studies
will
be
led
astray
from
the
acquirement
of
more
important
but
less
attractive
knowledge
and
even
if
they
can
learn
something
of
science
without
prejudice
to
their
usefulness
what
is
the
good
of
their
attempting
to
instil
that
knowledge
into
boys
whose
real
business
is
the
acquisition
of
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
these
questions
are
and
will
be
very
commonly
asked
for
they
arise
from
that
profound
ignorance
of
the
value
and
true
position
of
physical
science
which
infests
the
minds
of
the
most
highly
educated
and
intelligent
classes
of
the
community
but
if
i
did
not
feel
well
assured
that
they
are
capable
of
being
easily
and
satisfactorily
answered
that
they
have
been
answered
over
and
over
again
and
that
the
time
will
come
when
men
of
liberal
education
will
blush
to
raise
such
questions
i
should
be
ashamed
of
my
position
here
without
doubt
it
is
your
great
and
very
important
function
to
carry
out
elementary
education
without
question
anything
that
should
interfere
with
the
faithful
fulfilment
of
that
duty
on
your
part
would
be
a
great
evil
and
if
i
thought
that
your
acquirement
of
the
elements
of
physical
science
and
your
communication
of
those
elements
to
your
pupils
involved
any
sort
of
interference
with
your
proper
duties
i
should
be
the
first
person
to
protest
against
your
being
encouraged
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
but
is
it
true
that
the
acquisition
of
such
a
knowledge
of
science
as
is
proposed
and
the
communication
of
that
knowledge
are
calculated
to
weaken
your
usefulness
or
may
i
not
rather
ask
is
it
possible
for
you
to
discharge
your
functions
properly
without
these
aids
what
is
the
purpose
of
primary
intellectual
education
i
apprehend
that
its
first
object
is
to
train
the
young
in
the
use
of
those
tools
wherewith
men
extract
knowledge
from
the
succession
of
phenomena
which
pass
before
their
eyes
and
that
its
second
object
is
to
inform
them
of
the
fundamental
laws
which
have
been
found
by
experience
to
govern
the
course
of
things
so
that
they
may
not
be
turned
out
into
the
world
naked
defenceless
and
a
prey
to
the
events
they
might
control
a
boy
is
taught
to
read
his
own
and
other
languages
in
order
that
he
may
have
access
to
infinitely
wider
stores
of
knowledge
than
could
ever
be
opened
to
him
by
oral
intercourse
with
his
fellow
men
he
learns
to
write
that
his
means
of
communication
with
the
rest
of
mankind
may
be
indefinitely
enlarged
and
that
he
may
record
and
store
up
the
knowledge
he
acquires
he
is
taught
elementary
mathematics
that
he
may
understand
all
those
relations
of
number
and
form
upon
which
the
transactions
of
men
associated
in
complicated
societies
are
built
and
that
he
may
have
some
practice
in
deductive
reasoning
all
these
operations
of
reading
writing
and
ciphering
are
intellectual
tools
whose
use
should
before
all
things
be
learned
and
learned
thoroughly
so
that
the
youth
may
be
enabled
to
make
his
life
that
which
it
ought
to
be
a
continual
progress
in
learning
and
in
wisdom
but
in
addition
primary
education
endeavours
to
fit
a
boy
out
with
a
certain
equipment
of
positive
knowledge
he
is
taught
the
great
laws
of
morality
the
religion
of
his
sect
so
much
history
and
geography
as
will
tell
him
where
the
great
countries
of
the
world
are
what
they
are
and
how
they
have
become
what
they
are
without
doubt
all
these
are
most
fitting
and
excellent
things
to
teach
a
boy
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
omit
any
of
them
from
any
scheme
of
primary
intellectual
education
the
system
is
excellent
so
far
as
it
goes
but
if
i
regard
it
closely
a
curious
reflection
arises
i
suppose
that
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
the
child
of
any
roman
citizen
was
taught
just
these
same
things
reading
and
writing
in
his
own
and
perhaps
the
greek
tongue
the
elements
of
mathematics
and
the
religion
morality
history
and
geography
current
in
his
time
furthermore
i
do
not
think
i
err
in
affirming
that
if
such
a
christian
roman
boy
who
had
finished
his
education
could
be
transplanted
into
one
of
our
public
schools
and
pass
through
its
course
of
instruction
he
would
not
meet
with
a
single
unfamiliar
line
of
thought
amidst
all
the
new
facts
he
would
have
to
learn
not
one
would
suggest
a
different
mode
of
regarding
the
universe
from
that
current
in
his
own
time
and
yet
surely
there
is
some
great
difference
between
the
civilisation
of
the
fourth
century
and
that
of
the
nineteenth
and
still
more
between
the
intellectual
habits
and
tone
of
thought
of
that
day
and
this
and
what
has
made
this
difference
i
answer
fearlessly
the
prodigious
development
of
physical
science
within
the
last
two
centuries
modern
civilisation
rests
upon
physical
science
take
away
her
gifts
to
our
own
country
and
our
position
among
the
leading
nations
of
the
world
is
gone
for
it
is
physical
science
only
that
makes
intelligence
and
moral
energy
stronger
than
brute
force
the
whole
of
modern
thought
is
steeped
in
science
it
has
made
its
way
into
the
works
of
our
best
poets
and
even
the
mere
man
of
letters
who
affects
to
ignore
and
despise
science
is
unconsciously
impregnated
with
her
spirit
and
indebted
for
his
best
products
to
her
methods
i
believe
that
the
greatest
intellectual
revolution
mankind
has
yet
seen
is
now
slowly
taking
place
by
her
agency
she
is
teaching
the
world
that
the
ultimate
court
of
appeal
is
observation
and
experiment
and
not
authority
she
is
teaching
it
to
estimate
the
value
of
evidence
she
is
creating
a
firm
and
living
faith
in
the
existence
of
immutable
moral
and
physical
laws
perfect
obedience
to
which
is
the
highest
possible
aim
of
an
intelligent
being
but
of
all
this
your
old
stereotyped
system
of
education
takes
no
note
physical
science
its
methods
its
problems
and
its
difficulties
will
meet
the
poorest
boy
at
every
turn
and
yet
we
educate
him
in
such
a
manner
that
he
shall
enter
the
world
as
ignorant
of
the
existence
of
the
methods
and
facts
of
science
as
the
day
he
was
born
the
modern
world
is
full
of
artillery
and
we
turn
out
our
children
to
do
battle
in
it
equipped
with
the
shield
and
sword
of
an
ancient
gladiator
posterity
will
cry
shame
on
us
if
we
do
not
remedy
this
deplorable
state
of
things
nay
if
we
live
twenty
years
longer
our
own
consciences
will
cry
shame
on
us
it
is
my
firm
conviction
that
the
only
way
to
remedy
it
is
to
make
the
elements
of
physical
science
an
integral
part
of
primary
education
i
have
endeavoured
to
show
you
how
that
may
be
done
for
that
branch
of
science
which
it
is
my
business
to
pursue
and
i
can
but
add
that
i
should
look
upon
the
day
when
every
schoolmaster
throughout
this
land
was
a
centre
of
genuine
however
rudimentary
scientific
knowledge
as
an
epoch
in
the
history
of
the
country
but
let
me
entreat
you
to
remember
my
last
words
addressing
myself
to
you
as
teachers
i
would
say
mere
book
learning
in
physical
science
is
a
sham
and
a
delusion
what
you
teach
unless
you
wish
to
be
impostors
that
you
must
first
know
and
real
knowledge
in
science
means
personal
acquaintance
with
the
facts
be
they
few
or
many
footnote
it
has
been
suggested
to
me
that
these
words
may
be
taken
to
imply
a
discouragement
on
my
part
of
any
sort
of
scientific
instruction
which
does
not
give
an
acquaintance
with
the

hand

this

not
my
meaning
the
ideal
of
scientific
teaching
is
no
doubt
a
system
by
which
the
scholar
sees
every
fact
for
himself
and
the
teacher
supplies
only
the
explanations
circumstances
however
do
not
often
allow
of
the
attainment
of
that
ideal
and
we
must
put
up
with
the
next
best
system
one
in
which
the
scholar
takes
a
good
deal
on
trust
from
a
teacher
who
knowing
the
facts
by
his
own
knowledge
can
describe
them
with
so
much
vividness
as
to
enable
his
audience
to
form
competent
ideas
concerning
them
the
system
which
i
repudiate
is
that
which
allows
teachers
who
have
not
come
into
direct
contact
with
the

the

a

and
i
shall
try
to
give
some
notion
of
the
fruits
both
intellectual
and
practical
which
we
owe
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
working
out
by
seven
generations
of
patient
and
laborious
investigators
of
the
thought
which
arose
more
than
two
centuries
ago
in
the
mind
of
a
sagacious
and
observant
italian
naturalist
it
is
a
matter
of
everyday
experience
that
it
is
difficult
to
prevent
many
articles
of
food
from
becoming
covered
with
mould
that
fruit
sound
enough
to
all
appearance
often
contains
grubs
at
the
core
that
meat
left
to
itself

putrefy

the
philosophers
of
antiquity
interrogated
as
to
the
cause
of
these
phenomena
were
provided
with
a
ready
and
a
plausible
answer
it
did
not
enter
their
minds
even
to
doubt
that
these
low
forms
of
life
were
generated
in
the
matters

which
they
made
their

from

the
proposition
that
life
may
and
does
proceed
from
that
which
has
no
life
then
was
held
alike
by
the
philosophers
the
poets
and
the
people
of
the
most
enlightened
nations
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
and
it
remained
the
accepted
doctrine
of
learned
and
unlearned
europe
through
the
middle
ages
down
even
to
the
seventeenth
century
it
is
commonly
counted
among
the
many
merits
of
our
great
countryman
harvey
that
he
was
the
first
to
declare
the
opposition
of
fact
to
venerable
authority
in
this
as
in
other
matters
but
i
can
discover
no
justification
for
this
widespread
notion
after
careful
search
through
the
exercitationes

the
most
that
appears
clear
to
me
is
that
harvey
believed
all
animals
and
plants
to
spring
from
what
he
terms
a
a
phrase
which
may
nowadays
be
rendered
a
vegetative
germ
and
this
he
says
is
or
not
he
is
careful
to
add
that
it
necessarily
has
the
shape
of
an
egg
but
because
it
has
the
constitution
and
nature
of
one
that
this
must
needs
in
all
cases
proceed
from
a
living
parent
is
nowhere
expressly
maintained
by
harvey
though
such
an
opinion
may
be
thought
to
be
implied
in
one
or
two
passages
while
on
the
other
hand
he
does
more
than
once
use
language
which
is
consistent
only
with
a
full
belief
in
spontaneous
or
equivocal
generation
in
fact
the
main
concern
of
harvey
wonderful
little
treatise
is
not
with
generation
in
the
physiological
sense
at
all
but
with
development
and
his
great
object
is
the

francesco
redi
a
man
of
the
widest
knowledge
and
most
versatile
abilities
distinguished
alike
as
scholar
poet
physician
and
naturalist
who
just
two
hundred
and
two
years
ago
published
his
esperienze
intorno
alla
generazione
insetti
and
gave
to
the
world
the
idea
the
growth
of
which
it
is
my
purpose
to
trace
redi
book
went
through
five
editions
in
twenty
years
and
the
extreme
simplicity
of
his
experiments
and
the
clearness
of
his
arguments
gained
for
his
views
and
for
their
consequences
almost
universal
acceptance
redi
did
not
trouble
himself
much
with
speculative
considerations
but
attacked
particular
cases
of
what
was
supposed
to
be
spontaneous
generation
experimentally
here
are
dead
animals
or
pieces
of
meat
says
he
i
expose
them
to
the
air
in
hot
weather
and
in
a
few
days
they
swarm
with
maggots
you
tell
me
that
these
are
generated
in
the
dead
flesh
but
if
i
put
similar
bodies
while
quite
fresh
into
a
jar
and
tie
some
fine
gauze
over
the
top
of
the
jar
not
a
maggot
makes
its
appearance
while
the
dead
substances
nevertheless
putrefy
just
in
the
same
way
as
before
it
is
obvious
therefore
that
the
maggots
are
not
generated
by
the
corruption
of
the
meat
and
that
the
cause
of
their
formation
must
be
a
something
which
is
kept
away
by
gauze
but
gauze
will
not
keep
away
aëriform
bodies
or
fluids
this
something
must
therefore
exist
in
the
form
of
solid
particles
too
big
to
get
through
the
gauze
nor
is
one
long
left
in
doubt
what
these
solid
particles
are
for
the
blowflies
attracted
by
the
odour
of
the
meat
swarm
round
the
vessel
and
urged
by
a
powerful
but
in
this
case
misleading
instinct
lay
eggs
out
of
which
maggots
are
immediately
hatched
upon
the
gauze
the
conclusion
therefore
is
unavoidable
the
maggots
are
not
generated
by
the
meat
but
the
eggs
which
give
rise
to
them
are
brought
through
the
air
by
the
flies
these
experiments
seem
almost
childishly
simple
and
one
wonders
how
it
was
that
no
one
ever
thought
of
them
before
simple
as
they
are
however
they
are
worthy
of
the
most
careful
study
for
every
piece
of
experimental
work
since
done
in
regard
to
this
subject
has
been
shaped
upon
the
model
furnished
by
the
italian
philosopher
as
the
results
of
his
experiments
were
the
same
however
varied
the
nature
of
the
materials
he
used
it
is
not
wonderful
that
there
arose
in
redi
mind
a
presumption
that
in
all
such
cases
of
the
seeming
production
of
life
from
dead
matter
the
real
explanation
was
the
introduction
of
living
germs
from
without
into
that
dead
matter
and
thus
the
hypothesis
that
living
matter
always
arises
by
the
agency
of
living
matter
took
definite
shape
and
had
henceforward
a
right
to
be
considered
and
a
claim
to
be
refuted
in
each
particular
case
before
the
production
of
living
matter
in
any
other
way
could
be
admitted
by
careful
reasoners
it
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
refer
to
this
hypothesis
so
frequently
that
to
save
circumlocution
i
shall
call
it
the
hypothesis

prefers
the

indeed
he
regards
these

the

gives

looks
upon

it
is
of
great
importance
to
apprehend
redi
position
rightly
for
the
lines
of
thought
he
laid
down
for
us
are
those
upon
which
naturalists
have
been
working
ever
since
clearly
he
held
as
against
and
i
shall
immediately
proceed
in
the
first
place
to
inquire
how
far
subsequent
investigation
has
borne
him
out
in
so
doing
but
redi
also
thought
that
there
were
two
modes
of
biogenesis
by
the
one
method
which
is
that
of
common
and
ordinary
occurrence
the
living
parent
gives
rise
to
offspring
which
passes
through
the
same
cycle
of
changes
as
itself
like
gives
rise
to
like
and
this
has
been
termed
by
the
other
mode
the
living
parent
was
supposed
to
give
rise
to
offspring
which
passed
through
a
totally
different
series
of
states
from
those
exhibited
by
the
parent
and
did
not
return
into
the
cycle
of
the
parent
this
is
what
ought
to
be
called
the
offspring
being
altogether
and
permanently
unlike
the
parent
the
term
heterogenesis
however
has
unfortunately
been
used
in
a
different
sense
and
has
therefore
substituted
for
it
which
means
the
generation
of
something
foreign
after
discussing
hypothesis
of
universal
biogenesis
then
i
shall
go
on
to
ask
how
far
the
growth
of
science
justifies
his
other
hypothesis
of
xenogenesis
the
progress
of
the
hypothesis
of
biogenesis
was
triumphant
and
unchecked
for
nearly
a
century
the
application
of
the
microscope
to
anatomy
in
the
hands
of
grew
leeuwenhoek
swammerdam
lyonnet
vallisnieri
réaurnur
and
other
illustrious
investigators
of
nature
of
that
day
displayed
such
a
complexity
of
organisation
in
the
lowest
and
minutest
forms
and
everywhere
revealed
such
a
prodigality
of
provision
for
their
multiplication
by
germs
of
one
sort
or
another
that
the
hypothesis
of
abiogenesis
began
to
appear
not
only
untrue
but
absurd
and
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
needham
and
buffon
took
up
the
question
it
was
almost
universally
discredited

writing

but
the
skill
of
the
microscope
makers
of
the
eighteenth
century
soon
reached
its
limit
a
microscope
magnifying
diameters
was
a
of
the
opticians
of
that
day
and
at
the
same
time
by
no
means
trustworthy
but
a
magnifying
power
of
diameters
even
when
definition
reaches
the
exquisite
perfection
of
our
modern
achromatic
lenses
hardly
suffices
for
the
mere
discernment
of
the
smallest
forms
of
life
a
speck
only
of
an
inch
in
diameter
has
at
ten
inches
from
the
eye
the
same
apparent
size
as
an
object
of
an
inch
in
diameter
when
magnified
times
but
forms
of
living
matter
abound
the
diameter
of
which
is
not
more
than
of
an
inch
a
filtered
infusion
of
hay
allowed
to
stand
for
two
days
will
swarm
with
living
things
among
which
any
which
reaches
the
diameter
of
a
human
red
corpuscle
or
about
of
an
inch
is
a
giant
it
is
only
by
bearing
these
facts
in
mind
that
we
can
deal
fairly
with
the
remarkable
statements
and
speculations
put
forward
by
buffon
and
needham
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
a
portion
of
any
animal
or
vegetable
body
is
infused
in
water
it
gradually
softens
and
disintegrates
and
as
it
does
so
the
water
is
found
to
swarm
with
minute
active
creatures
the
infusorial
animalcules
none
of
which
can
be
seen
except
by
the
aid
of
the
microscope
while
a
large
proportion
belong
to
the
category
of
smallest
things
of
which
i
have
spoken
and
which
must
have
looked
like
mere
dots
and
lines
under
the
ordinary
microscopes
of
the
eighteenth
century
led
by
various
theoretical
considerations
which
i
can
not
now
discuss
but
which
looked
promising
enough
in
the
lights
of
their
time
buffon
and
needham
doubted
the
applicability
of
redi
hypothesis
to
the
infusorial
animalcules
and
needham
very
properly
endeavoured
to
put
the
question
to
an
experimental
test
he
said
to
himself
if
these
infusorial
animalcules
come
from
germs
their
germs
must
exist
either
in
the
substance
infused
or
in
the
water
with
which
the
infusion
is
made
or
in
the
superjacent
air
now
the
vitality
of
all
germs
is
destroyed
by
heat
therefore
if
i
boil
the
infusion
cork
it
up
carefully
cementing
the
cork
over
with
mastic
and
then
heat
the
whole
vessel
by
heaping
hot
ashes
over
it
i
must
needs
kill
whatever
germs
are
present
consequently
if
hypothesis
hold
good
when
the
infusion
is
taken
away
and
allowed
to
cool
no
animalcules
ought
to
be
developed
in
it
whereas
if
the
animalcules
are
not
dependent
on
germs
but
are
generated
from
the
infused
substance
they
ought
by
and
by
to
make
their
appearance
needham
found
that
under
the
circumstances
in
which
he
made
his
experiments
animalcules
always
did
arise
in
the
infusions
when
a
sufficient
time
had
elapsed
to
allow
for
their
development
in
much
of
his
work
needham
was
associated
with
buffon
and
the
results
of
their
experiments
fitted
in
admirably
with
the
great
french
naturalist
hypothesis
of
organic
molecules
according
to
which
life
is
the
indefeasible
property
of
certain
indestructible
molecules
of
matter
which
exist
in
all
living
things
and
have
inherent
activities
by
which
they
are
distinguished
from
not
living
matter
each
individual
living
organism
is
formed
by
their
temporary
combination
they
stand
to
it
in
the
relation
of
the
particles
of
water
to
a
cascade
or
a
whirlpool
or
to
a
mould
into
which
the
water
is
poured
the
form
of
the
organism
is
thus
determined
by
the
reaction
between
external
conditions
and
the
inherent
activities
of
the
organic
molecules
of
which
it
is
composed
and
as
the
stoppage
of
a
whirlpool
destroys
nothing
but
a
form
and
leaves
the
molecules
of
the
water
with
all
their
inherent
activities
intact
so
what
we
call
the
death
and
putrefaction
of
an
animal
or
of
a
plant
is
merely
the
breaking
up
of
the
form
or
manner
of
association
of
its
constituent
organic
molecules
which
are
then
set
free
as
infusorial
animalcules
it
will
be
perceived
that
this
doctrine
is
by
no
means
identical
with
with
which
it
is
often
confounded
on
this
hypothesis
a
piece
of
beef
or
a
handful
of
hay
is
dead
only
in
a
limited
sense
the
beef
is
dead
ox
and
the
hay
is
dead
grass
but
the
organic
molecules
of
the
beef
or
the
hay
are
not
dead
but
are
ready
to
manifest
their
vitality
as
soon
as
the
bovine
or
herbaceous
shrouds
in
which
they
are
imprisoned
are
rent
by
the
macerating
action
of
water
the
hypothesis
therefore
must
be
classified
under
xenogenesis
rather
than
under
abiogenesis
such
as
it
was
i
think
it
will
appear
to
those
who
will
be
just
enough
to
remember
that
it
was
propounded
before
the
birth
of
modern
chemistry
and
of
the
modern
optical
arts
to
be
a
most
ingenious
and
suggestive
speculation
but
the
great
tragedy
of
science
the
slaying
of
a
beautiful
hypothesis
by
an
ugly
fact
which
is
so
constantly
being
enacted
under
the
eyes
of
philosophers
was
played
almost
immediately
for
the
benefit
of
buffon
and
needham
once
more
an
italian
the
abbé
spallanzani
a
worthy
successor
and
representative
of
redi
in
his
acuteness
his
ingenuity
and
his
learning
subjected
the
experiments
and
the
conclusions
of
needham
to
a
searching
criticism
it
might
be
true
that
needham
experiments
yielded
results
such
as
he
had
described
but
did
they
bear
out
his
arguments
was
it
not
possible
in
the
first
place
he
had
not
completely
excluded
the
air
by
his
corks
and
mastic
and
was
it
not
possible
in
the
second
place
that
he
had
not
sufficiently
heated
his
infusions
and
the
superjacent
air
spallanzani
joined
issue
with
the
english
naturalist
on
both
these
pleas
and
he
showed
that
if
in
the
first
place
the
glass
vessels
in
which
the
infusions
were
contained
were
hermetically
sealed
by
fusing
their
necks
and
if
in
the
second
place
they
were
exposed
to
the
temperature
of
boiling
water
for
of
an
hour
no
animalcules
ever
made
their
appearance
within
them
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
experiments
and
arguments
of
spallanzani
furnish
a
complete
and
a
crushing
reply
to
those
of
needham
but
we
all
too
often
forget
that
it
is
one
thing
to
refute
a
proposition
and
another
to
prove
the
truth
of
a
doctrine
which
implicitly
or
explicitly
contradicts
that
proposition
and
the
advance
of
science
soon
showed
that
though
needham
might
be
quite
wrong
it
did
not
follow
that
spallanzani
was
quite
right

the
birth
of
the
latter
half
of
the
eighteenth

grew
apace
and
soon
found
herself
face
to
face
with
the
great
problems
which
biology
had
vainly
tried
to
attack
without
her
help
the
discovery
of
oxygen
led
to
the
laying
of
the
foundations
of
a
scientific
theory
of
respiration
and
to
an
examination
of
the
marvellous
interactions
of
organic
substances
with
oxygen
the
presence
of
free
oxygen
appeared
to
be
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
existence
of
life
and
of
those
singular
changes
in
organic
matters
which
are
known
as
fermentation
and
putrefaction
the
question
of
the
generation
of
the
infusory
animalcules
thus
passed
into
a
new
phase
for
what
might
not
have
happened
to
the
organic
matter
of
the
infusions
or
to
the
oxygen
of
the

in
spallanzani

security
was
there
that
the
development
of
life
which
ought
to
have
taken
place
had
not
been
checked
or
prevented
by
these
changes
the
battle
had
to
be
fought
again
it
was
needful
to
repeat
the
experiments
under
conditions
which
would
make
sure
that
neither
the
oxygen
of
the
air
nor
the
composition
of
the
organic
matter
was
altered
in
such
a
manner
as
to
interfere
with
the
existence
of
life
schulze
and
schwann
took
up
the
question
from
this
point
of
view
in
and
the
passage
of
air
through
glass
tubes
or
through
strong
sulphuric
acid
does
not
alter
the
proportion
of
its
oxygen
while
it
must
needs
arrest
or
destroy
any
organic
matter
which
may
be
contained
in
the
air
these
experimenters
therefore
contrived
arrangements
by
which
the
only
air
which
should
come
into
contact
with
a
boiled
infusion
should
be
such
as
had
either
passed
through
tubes
or
through
strong
sulphuric
acid
the
result
which
they
obtained
was
that
an
infusion
so
treated
developed
no
living
things
while
if
the
same
infusion
was
afterwards
exposed
to
the
air
such
things
appeared
rapidly
and
abundantly
the
accuracy
of
these
experiments
has
been
alternately
denied
and
affirmed
supposing
then
to
be
accepted
however
all
that
they
really
proved
was
that
the
treatment
to
which
the
air
was
subjected
destroyed
that
was
essential
to
the
development
of
life
in
the
infusion
this
something
might
be
gaseous
fluid
or
solid
that
it
consisted
of
germs
remained
only
an
hypothesis
of
greater
or
less
probability
contemporaneously
with
these
investigations
a
remarkable
discovery
was
made
by
cagniard
de
la
tour
he
found
that
common
yeast
is
composed
of
a
vast
accumulation
of
minute
plants
the
fermentation
of
must
or
of
wort
in
the
fabrication
of
wine
and
of
beer
is
always
accompanied
by
the
rapid
growth
and
multiplication
of
these
thus
fermentation
in
so
far
as
it
was
accompanied
by
the
development
of
microscopical
organisms
in
enormous
numbers
became
assimilated
to
the
decomposition
of
an
infusion
of
ordinary
animal
or
vegetable
matter
and
it
was
an
obvious
suggestion
that
the
organisms
were
in
some
way
or
other
the
causes
both
of
fermentation
and
of
putrefaction
the
chemists
with
berzelius
and
liebig
at
their
head
at
first
laughed
this
idea
to
scorn
but
in
a
man
then
very
young
who
has
since
performed
the
unexampled
feat
of
attaining
to
high
eminence
alike
in
mathematics
physics
and
physiology
i
speak
of
the
illustrious
helmholtz
reduced
the
matter
to
the
test
of
experiment
by
a
method
alike
elegant
and
conclusive
helmholtz
separated
a
putrefying
or
a
fermenting
liquid
from
one
which
was
simply
putrescible
or
fermentable
by
a
membrane
which
allowed
the
fluids
to
pass
through
and
become
intermixed
but
stopped
the
passage
of
solids
the
result
was
that
while
the
putrescible
or
the
fermentable
liquids
became
impregnated
with
the
results
of
the
putrescence
or
fermentation
which
was
going
on
on
the
other
side
of
the
membrane
they
neither
putrefied
in
the
ordinary
way
nor
fermented
nor
were
any
of
the
organisms
which
abounded
in
the
fermenting
or
putrefying
liquid
generated
in
them
therefore
the
cause
of
the
development
of
these
organisms
must
lie
in
something
which
can
not
pass
through
membranes
and
as
helmholtz
investigations
were
long
antecedent
to
graham
researches
upon
colloids
his
natural
conclusion
was
that
the
agent
thus
intercepted
must
be
a
solid
material
in
point
of
fact
helmholtz
experiments
narrowed
the
issue
to
this
that
which
excites
fermentation
and
putrefaction
and
at
the
same
time
gives
rise
to
living
forms
in
a
fermentable
or
putrescible
fluid
is
not
a
gas
and
is
not
a
diffusible
fluid
therefore
it
is
either
a
colloid
or
it
is
matter
divided
into
very
minute
solid
particles
the
researches
of
schroeder
and
dusch
in
and
of
schroeder
alone
in
cleared
up
this
point
by
experiments
which
are
simply
refinements
upon
those
of
redi
a
lump
of
is
physically
speaking
a
pile
of
many
thicknesses
of
a
very
fine
gauze
the
fineness
of
the
meshes
of
which
depends
upon
the
closeness
of
the
compression
of
the
wool
now
schroeder
and
dusch
found
that
in
the
case
of
all
the
putrefiable
materials
which
they
used
except
milk
and
yolk
of
egg
an
infusion
boiled
and
then
allowed
to
come
into
contact
with
no
air
but
such
as
had
been
filtered
through
neither
putrefied
nor
fermented
nor
developed
living
forms
it
is
hard
to
imagine
what
the
fine
sieve
formed
by
the
could
have
stopped
except
minute
solid
particles
still
the
evidence
was
incomplete
until
it
had
been
positively
shown
first
that
ordinary
air
does
contain
such
particles
and
secondly
that
filtration
through
arrests
these
particles
and
allows
only
physically
pure
air
to
pass
this
demonstration
has
been
furnished
within
the
last
year
by
the
remarkable
experiments
of
professor
tyndall
it
has
been
a
common
objection
of
abiogenists
that
if
the
doctrine
of
biogeny
is
true
the
air
must
be
thick
with
germs
and
they
regard
this
as
the
height
of
absurdity
but
nature
occasionally
is
exceedingly
unreasonable
and
professor
tyndall
has
proved
that
this
particular
absurdity
may
nevertheless
be
a
reality
he
has
demonstrated
that
ordinary
air
is
no
better
than
a
sort
of
stirabout
of
excessively
minute
solid
particles
that
these
particles
are
almost
wholly
destructible
by
heat
and
that
they
are
strained
off
and
the
air
rendered
optically
pure
by
its
being
passed
through
it
remains
yet
in
the
order
of
logic
though
not
of
history
to
show
that
among
these
solid
destructible
particles
there
really
do
exist
germs
capable
of
giving
rise
to
the
development
of
living
forms
in
suitable
menstrua
this
piece
of
work
was
done
by
pasteur
in
those
beautiful
researches
which
will
ever
render
his
name
famous
and
which
in
spite
of
all
attacks
upon
them
appear
to
me
now
as
they
did
seven
years
ago
to
be
models
of
accurate
experimentation
and
logical
reasoning
he
strained
air
through
and
found
as
schroeder
and
dusch
had
done
that
it
contained
nothing
competent
to
give
rise
to
the
development
of
life
in
fluids
highly
fitted
for
that
purpose
but
the
important
further
links
in
the
chain
of
evidence
added
by
pasteur
are
three
in
the
first
place
he
subjected
to
microscopic
examination
the
which
had
served
as
strainer
and
found
that
sundry
bodies
clearly
recognisable
as
germs
were
among
the
solid
particles
strained
off
secondly
he
proved
that
these
germs
were
competent
to
give
rise
to
living
forms
by
simply
sowing
them
in
a
solution
fitted
for
their
development
and
thirdly
he
showed
that
the
incapacity
of
air
strained
through
wool
to
give
rise
to
life
was
not
due
to
any
occult
change
effected
in
the
constituents
of
the
air
by
the
wool
by
proving
that
the
might
be
dispensed
with
altogether
and
perfectly
free
access
left
between
the
exterior
air
and
that
in
the
experimental
flask
if
the
neck
of
the
flask
is
drawn
out
into
a
tube
and
bent
downwards
and
if
after
the
contained
fluid
has
been
carefully
boiled
the
tube
is
heated
sufficiently
to
destroy
any
germs
which
may
be
present
in
the
air
which
enters
as
the
fluid
cools
the
apparatus
may
be
left
to
itself
for
any
time
and
no
life
will
appear
in
the
fluid
the
reason
is
plain
although
there
is
free
communication
between
the
atmosphere
laden
with
germs
and
the
germless
air
in
the
flask
contact
between
the
two
takes
place
only
in
the
tube
and
as
the
germs
can
not
fall
upwards
and
there
are
no
currents
they
never
reach
the
interior
of
the
flask
but
if
the
tube
be
broken
short
off
where
it
proceeds
from
the
flask
and
free
access
be
thus
given
to
germs
falling
vertically
out
of
the
air
the
fluid
which
has
remained
clear
and
desert
for
months
becomes
in
a
few
days
turbid
and
full
of
life

remain

an
indefinite

i
have
sought
in
vain
for
any
explanation
of
these
facts
except
the
obvious
one
that
the
air
contains
germs
competent
to
give
rise
to
such
as
those
with
which
the
first
solution
has
been
knowingly

purposely
inoculated

i
have
not

been

meet

any
advocate

seriously
maintains
that
the

tartrate
of

under
no
influence
but
that
of
free
access
of

and
the

give
rise
to

but
the
alternative
is
to
admit
that
these
arise
from
germs
in
the
air
and
if
they
are
thus
propagated
the
burden
of
proof
that
other
like
forms
are
generated
in
a
different
manner
must
rest
with
the
assertor
of
that
proposition
footnote
infusion
of
hay
treated
in
the
same
way
yields
similar
results
but
as
it
contains
organic
matter
the
argument
which
follows
can
not
be
based
upon
it
to
sum
up
the
effect
of
this
long
chain
of
evidence
it
is
demonstrable
that
a
fluid
eminently
fit
for
the
development
of
the
lowest
forms
of
life
but
which
contains
neither
germs
nor
any
protein
compound
gives
rise
to
living
things
in
great
abundance
if
it
is
exposed
to
ordinary
air
while
no
such
development
takes
place
if
the
air
with
which
it
is
in
contact
is
mechanically
freed
from
the
solid
particles
which
ordinarily
float
in
it
and
which
may
be
made
visible
by
appropriate
means
it
is
demonstrable
that
the
great
majority
of
these
particles
are
destructible
by
heat
and
that
some
of
them
are
germs
or
living
particles
capable
of
giving
rise
to
the
same
forms
of
life
as
those
which
appear
when
the
fluid
is
exposed
to
unpurified
air
it
is
demonstrable
that
inoculation
of
the
experimental
fluid
with
a
drop
of
liquid
known
to
contain
living
particles
gives
rise
to
the
same
phenomena
as
exposure
to
unpurified
air
and
it
is
further
certain
that
these
living
particles
are
so
minute
that
the
assumption
of
their
suspension
in
ordinary
air
presents
not
the
slightest
difficulty
on
the
contrary
considering
their
lightness
and
the
wide
diffusion
of
the
organisms
which
produce
them
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
that
they
should
not
be
suspended
in
the
atmosphere
in
myriads
thus
the
evidence
direct
and
indirect
in
favour
of
for
all
known
forms
of
life
must
i
think
be
admitted
to
be
of
great
weight
on
the
other
side
the
sole
assertions
worthy
of
attention
are
that
hermetically
sealed
fluids
which
have
been
exposed
to
great
and
continued
heat
have
sometimes
exhibited
living
forms
of
low
organisation
when
they
have
been
opened
the
first
reply
that
suggests
itself
is
the
probability
that
there
must
be
some
error
about
these
experiments
because
they
are
performed
on
an
enormous
scale
every
day
with
quite
contrary
results
meat
fruits
vegetables
the
very
materials
of
the
most
fermentable
and
putrescible
infusions
are
preserved
to
the
extent
i
suppose
i
may
say
of
thousands
of
tons
every
year
by
a
method
which
is
a
mere
application
of
spallanzani
experiment
the
matters
to
be
preserved
are
well
boiled
in
a
tin
case
provided
with
a
small
hole
and
this
hole
is
soldered
up
when
all
the
air
in
the
case
has
been
replaced
by
steam
by
this
method
they
may
be
kept
for
years
without
putrefying
fermenting
or
getting
mouldy
now
this
is
not
because
oxygen
is
excluded
inasmuch
as
it
is
now
proved
that
free
oxygen
is
not
necessary
for
either
fermentation
or
putrefaction
it
is
not
because
the
tins
are
exhausted
of
air
for
and
live
as
pasteur
has
shown
without
air
or
free
oxygen
it
is
not
because
the
boiled
meats
or
vegetables
are
not
putrescible
or
fermentable
as
those
who
have
had
the
misfortune
to
be
in
a
ship
supplied
with
unskilfully
closed
tins
well
know
what
is
it
therefore
but
the
exclusion
of
germs
i
think
that
abiogenists
are
bound
to
answer
this
question
before
they
ask
us
to
consider
new
experiments
of
precisely
the
same
order
and
in
the
next
place
if
the
results
of
the
experiments
i
refer
to
are
really
trustworthy
it
by
no
means
follows
that
abiogenesis
has
taken
place
the
resistance
of
living
matter
to
heat
is
known
to
vary
within
considerable
limits
and
to
depend
to
some
extent
upon
the
chemical
and
physical
qualities
of
the
surrounding
medium
but
if
in
the
present
state
of
science
the
alternative
is
offered
us
either
germs
can
stand
a
greater
heat
than
has
been
supposed
or
the
molecules
of
dead
matter
for
no
valid
or
intelligible
reason
that
is
assigned
are
able
to
arrange
themselves
into
living
bodies
exactly
such
as
can
be
demonstrated
to
be
frequently
produced
in
another
way
i
can
not
understand
how
choice
can
be
even
for
a
moment
doubtful
but
though
i
can
not
express
this
conviction
of
mine
too
strongly
i
must
carefully
guard
myself
against
the
supposition
that
i
intend
to
suggest
that
no
such
thing
as
abiogenesis
ever
has
taken
place
in
the
past
or
ever
will
take
place
in
the
future
with
organic
chemistry
molecular
physics
and
physiology
yet
in
their
infancy
and
every
day
making
prodigious
strides
i
think
it
would
be
the
height
of
presumption
for
any
man
to
say
that
the
conditions
under
which
matter
assumes
the
properties
we
call
vital
may
not
some
day
be
artificially
brought
together
all
i
feel
justified
in
affirming
is
that
i
see
no
reason
for
believing
that
the
feat
has
been
performed
yet
and
looking
back
through
the
prodigious
vista
of
the
past
i
find
no
record
of
the
commencement
of
life
and
therefore
i
am
devoid
of
any
means
of
forming
a
definite
conclusion
as
to
the
conditions
of
its
appearance
belief
in
the
scientific
sense
of
the
word
is
a
serious
matter
and
needs
strong
foundations
to
say
therefore
in
the
admitted
absence
of
evidence
that
i
have
any
belief
as
to
the
mode
in
which
the
existing
forms
of
life
have
originated
would
be
using
words
in
a
wrong
sense
but
expectation
is
permissible
where
belief
is
not
and
if
it
were
given
me
to
look
beyond
the
abyss
of
geologically
recorded
time
to
the
still
more
remote
period
when
the
earth
was
passing
through
physical
and
chemical
conditions
which
it
can
no
more
see
again
than
a
man
can
recall
his
infancy
i
should
expect
to
be
a
witness
of
the
evolution
of
living
protoplasm
from
not
living
matter
i
should
expect
to
see
it
appear
under
forms
of
great
simplicity
endowed
like
existing
fungi
with
the
power
of
determining
the
formation
of
new
protoplasm
from
such
matters
as
ammonium
carbonates
oxalates
and
tartrates
alkaline
and
earthy
phosphates
and
water
without
the
aid
of
light
that
is
the
expectation
to
which
analogical
reasoning
leads
me
but
i
beg
you
once
more
to
recollect
that
i
have
no
right
to
call
my
opinion
anything
but
an
act
of
philosophical
faith
so
much
for
the
history
of
the
progress
of
redi
great
doctrine
of
biogenesis
which
appears
to
me
with
the
limitations
i
have
expressed
to
be
victorious
along
the
whole
line
at
the
present
day
as
regards
the
second
problem
offered
to
us
by
redi
whether
xenogenesis
obtains
side
by
side
with
homogenesis
whether
that
is
there
exist
not
only
the
ordinary
living
things
giving
rise
to
offspring
which
run
through
the
same
cycle
as
themselves
but
also
others
producing
offspring
which
are
of
a
totally
different
character
from
themselves
the
researches
of
two
centuries
have
led
to
a
different
result
that
the
grubs
found
in
galls
are
no
product
of
the
plants
on
which
the
galls
grow
but
are
the
result
of
the
introduction
of
the
eggs
of
insects
into
the
substance
of
these
plants
was
made
out
by
vallisnieri
réaumur
and
others
before
the
end
of
the
first
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
tapeworms
bladderworms
and
flukes
continued
to
be
a
stronghold
of
the
advocates
of
xenogenesis
for
a
much
longer
period
indeed
it
is
only
within
the
last
thirty
years
that
the
splendid
patience
of
von
siebold
van
beneden
leuckart
küchenmeister
and
other
helminthologists
has
succeeded
in
tracing
every
such
parasite
often
through
the
strangest
wanderings
and
metamorphoses
to
an
egg
derived
from
a
parent
actually
or
potentially
like
itself
and
the
tendency
of
inquiries
elsewhere
has
all
been
in
the
same
direction
a
plant
may
throw
off
bulbs
but
these
sooner
or
later
give
rise
to
seeds
or
spores
which
develop
into
the
original
form
a
polype
may
give
rise
to
medusae
or
a
pluteus
to
an
echinoderm
but
the
medusa
and
the
echinoderm
give
rise
to
eggs
which
produce
polypes
or
glutei
and
they
are
therefore
only
stages
in
the
cycle
of
life
of
the
species
but
if
we
turn
to
pathology
it
offers
us
some
remarkable
approximations
to
true
xenogenesis
as
i
have
already
mentioned
it
has
been
known
since
the
time
of
vallisnieri
and
of
réaumur
that
galls
in
plants
and
tumours
in
cattle
are
caused
by
insects
which
lay
their
eggs
in
those
parts
of
the
animal
or
vegetable
frame
of
which
these
morbid
structures
are
outgrowths
again
it
is
a
matter
of
familiar
experience
to
everybody
that
mere
pressure
on
the
skin
will
give
rise
to
a
corn
now
the
gall
the
tumour
and
the
corn
are
parts
of
the
living
body
which
have
become
to
a
certain
degree
independent
and
distinct
organisms
under
the
influence
of
certain
external
conditions
elements
of
the
body
which
should
have
developed
in
due
subordination
to
its
general
plan
set
up
for
themselves
and
apply
the
nourishment
which
they
receive
to
their
own
purposes
from
such
innocent
productions
as
corns
and
warts
there
are
all
gradations
to
the
serious
tumours
which
by
their
mere
size
and
the
mechanical
obstruction
they
cause
destroy
the
organism
out
of
which
they
are
developed
while
finally
in
those
terrible
structures
known
as
cancers
the
abnormal
growth
has
acquired
powers
of
reproduction
and
multiplication
and
is
only
morphologically
distinguishable
from
the
parasitic
worm
the
life
of
which
is
neither
more
nor
less
closely
bound
up
with
that
of
the
infested
organism
if
there
were
a
kind
of
diseased
structure
the
histological
elements
of
which
were
capable
of
maintaining
a
separate
and
independent
existence
out
of
the
body
it
seems
to
me
that
the
shadowy
boundary
between
morbid
growth
and
xenogenesis
would
be
effaced
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
progress
of
discovery
has
almost
brought
us
to
this
point
already
i
have
been
favoured
by
simon
with
an
early
copy
of
the
last
published
of
the
valuable
reports
on
the
public
health
which
in
his
capacity
of
their
medical
officer
he
annually
presents
to
the
lords
of
the
privy
council
the
appendix
to
this
report
contains
an
introductory
essay
on
the
intimate
pathology
of
contagion
by
which
is
one
of
the
clearest
most
comprehensive
and
discussions
of
a
great
question
which
has
come
under
my
notice
for
a
long
time
i
refer
you
to
it
for
details
and
for
the
authorities
for
the
statements
i
am
about
to
make
you
are
familiar
with
what
happens
in
vaccination
a
minute
cut
is
made
in
the
skin
and
an
infinitesimal
quantity
of
vaccine
matter
is
inserted
into
the
wound
within
a
certain
time
a
vesicle
appears
in
the
place
of
the
wound
and
the
fluid
which
distends
this
vesicle
is
vaccine
matter
in
quantity
a
hundred
or
a
thousandfold
that
which
was
originally
inserted
now
what
has
taken
place
in
the
course
of
this
operation
has
the
vaccine
matter
by
its
irritative
property
produced
a
mere
blister
the
fluid
of
which
has
the
same
irritative
property
or
does
the
vaccine
matter
contain
living
particles
which
have
grown
and
multiplied
where
they
have
been
planted
the
observations
of
chauveau
extended
and
confirmed
by
sanderson
himself
appear
to
leave
no
doubt
upon
this
head
experiments
similar
in
principle
to
those
of
helmholtz
on
fermentation
and
putrefaction
have
proved
that
the
active
element
in
the
vaccine
lymph
is
and
consists
of
minute
particles
not
exceeding
of
an
inch
in
diameter
which
are
made
visible
in
the
lymph
by
the
microscope
similar
experiments
have
proved
that
two
of
the
most
destructive
of
epizootic
diseases
and
glanders
are
also
dependent
for
their
existence
and
their
propagation
upon
extremely
small
living
solid
particles
to
which
the
title
of
is
applied
an
animal
suffering
under
either
of
these
terrible
diseases
is
a
source
of
infection
and
contagion
to
others
for
precisely
the
same
reason
as
a
tub
of
fermenting
beer
is
capable
of
propagating
its
fermentation
by
infection
or
contagion
to
fresh
wort
in
both
cases
it
is
the
solid
living
particles
which
are
efficient
the
liquid
in
which
they
float
and
at
the
expense
of
which
they
live
being
altogether
passive
now
arises
the
question
are
these
microzymes
the
results
of
or
of
are
they
capable
like
the
of
yeast
of
arising
only
by
the
development
of
germs
or
may
they
be
like
the
constituents
of
a
the
results
of
a
modification
and
individualisation
of
the
tissues
of
the
body
in
which
they
are
found
resulting
from
the
operation
of
certain
conditions
are
they
parasites
in
the
zoological
sense
or
are
they
merely
what
virchow
has
called
heterologous
growths
it
is
obvious
that
this
question
has
the
most
profound
importance
whether
we
look
at
it
from
a
practical
or
from
a
theoretical
point
of
view
a
parasite
may
be
stamped
out
by
destroying
its
germs
but
a
pathological
product
can
only
be
annihilated
by
removing
the
conditions
which
give
rise
to
it
it
appears
to
me
that
this
great
problem
will
have
to
be
solved
for
each
zymotic
disease
separately
for
analogy
cuts
two
ways
i
have
dwelt
upon
the
analogy
of
pathological
modification
which
is
in
favour
of
the
xenogenetic
origin
of
microzymes
but
i
must
now
speak
of
the
equally
strong
analogies
in
favour
of
the
origin
of
such
pestiferous
particles
by
the
ordinary
process
of
the
generation
of
like
from
like
it
is
at
present
a
fact
that
certain
diseases
both
of
plants
and
of
animals
which
have
all
the
characters
of
contagious
and
infectious
epidemics
are
caused
by
minute
organisms
the
smut
of
wheat
is
a
instance
of
such
a
disease
and
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
and
the
fall
under
the
same
category
among
animals
insects
are
wonderfully
liable
to
the
ravages
of
contagious
and
infectious
diseases
caused
by
microscopic
in
autumn
it
is
not
uncommon
to
see
flies
motionless
upon
a
with
a
sort
of
magic
circle
in
white
drawn
round
them
on
microscopic
examination
the
magic
circle
is
found
to
consist
of
innumerable
spores
which
have
been
thrown
off
in
all
directions
by
a
minute
fungus
called
the
filaments
of
which
stand
out
like
a
pile
of
velvet
from
the
body
of
the
fly
these
filaments
are
connected
with
others
which
fill
the
interior
of
the
fly
body
like
so
much
fine
wool
having
eaten
away
and
destroyed
the
viscera
this
is
the
condition
of
the
if
traced
back
to
its
earliest
stages
in
flies
which
are
still
active
and
to
all
appearance
healthy
it
is
found
to
exist
in
the
form
of
minute
corpuscles
which
float
in
the
blood
of
the
fly
these
multiply
and
lengthen
into
filaments
at
the
expense
of
the
fly
substance
and
when
they
have
at
last
killed
the
patient
they
grow
out
of
its
body
and
give
off
spores
healthy
flies
shut
up
with
diseased
ones
catch
this
mortal
disease
and
perish
like
the
others
a
most
competent
observer
cohn
who
studied
the
development
of
the
very
carefully
was
utterly
unable
to
discover
in
what
manner
the
smallest
germs
of
the
got
into
the
fly
the
spores
could
not
be
made
to
give
rise
to
such
germs
by
cultivation
nor
were
such
germs
discoverable
in
the
air
or
in
the
food
of
the
fly
it
looked
exceedingly
like
a
case
of
abiogenesis
or
at
any
rate
of
xenogenesis
and
it
is
only
quite
recently
that
the
real
course
of
events
has
been
made
out
it
has
been
ascertained
that
when
one
of
the
spores
falls
upon
the
body
of
a
fly
it
begins
to
germinate
and
sends
out
a
process
which
bores
its
way
through
the
fly
skin
this
having
reached
the
interior
cavities
of
its
body
gives
off
the
minute
floating
corpuscles
which
are
the
earliest
stage
of
the
the
disease
is
contagious
because
a
healthy
fly
coming
in
contact
with
a
diseased
one
from
which
the
filaments
protrude
is
pretty
sure
to
carry
off
a
spore
or
two
it
is
infectious
because
the
spores
become
scattered
about
all
sorts
of
matter
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
slain
flies
the
silkworm
has
long
been
known
to
be
subject
to
a
very
fatal
and
infectious
disease
called
the
audouin
transmitted
it
by
inoculation
this
disease
is
entirely
due
to
the
development
of
a
fungus
in
the
body
of
the
caterpillar
and
its
contagiousness
and
infectiousness
are
accounted
for
in
the
same
way
as
those
of
the
but
of
late
years
a
still
more
serious
epizootic
has
appeared
among
the
silkworms
and
i
may
mention
a
few
facts
which
will
give
you
some
conception
of
the
gravity
of
the
injury
which
it
has
inflicted
on
france
alone
the
production
of
silk
has
been
for
centuries
an
important
branch
of
industry
in
southern
france
and
in
the
year
it
had
attained
such
a
magnitude
that
the
annual
produce
of
the
french
sericulture
was
estimated
to
amount
to
a
tenth
of
that
of
the
whole
world
and
represented
a
value
of
francs
or
nearly
five
millions
sterling
what
may
be
the
sum
which
would
represent
the
of
all
the
industries
connected
with
the
working
up
of
the
raw
silk
thus
produced
is
more
than
i
can
pretend
to
estimate
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
city
of
lyons
is
built
upon
french
silk
as
much
as
manchester
was
upon
american
cotton
before
the
civil
war
silkworms
are
liable
to
many
diseases
and
even
before
a
peculiar
epizootic
frequently
accompanied
by
the
appearance
of
dark
spots
upon
the
skin
whence
the
name
of
pébrine
which
it
has
received
had
been
noted
for
its
mortality
but
in
the
years
following
this
malady
broke
out
with
such
extreme
violence
that
in
the
was
reduced
to
a
third
of
the
amount
which
it
had
reached
in
and
up
till
within
the
last
year
or
two
it
has
never
attained
half
the
yield
of
this
means
not
only
that
the
great
number
of
people
engaged
in
silk
growing
are
some
thirty
millions
sterling
poorer
than
they
might
have
been
it
means
not
only
that
high
prices
have
had
to
be
paid
for
imported
silkworm
eggs
and
that
after
investing
his
money
in
them
in
paying
for
and
for
attendance
the
cultivator
has
constantly
seen
his
silkworms
perish
and
himself
plunged
in
ruin
but
it
means
that
the
looms
of
lyons
have
lacked
employment
and
that
for
years
enforced
idleness
and
misery
have
been
the
portion
of
a
vast
population
which
in
former
days
was
industrious
and
in
the
gravity
of
the
situation
caused
the
french
academy
of
sciences
to
appoint
commissioners
of
whom
a
distinguished
naturalist
de
quatrefages
was
one
to
inquire
into
the
nature
of
this
disease
and
if
possible
to
devise
some
means
of
staying
the
plague
in
reading
the
report
made
by
de
quatrefages
in
it
is
exceedingly
interesting
to
observe
that
his
elaborate
study
of
the
pébrine
forced
the
conviction
upon
his
mind
that
in
its
mode
of
occurrence
and
propagation
the
disease
of
the
silkworm
is
in
every
respect
comparable
to
the
cholera
among
mankind
but
it
differs
from
the
cholera
and
so
far
is
a
more
formidable
malady
in
being
hereditary
and
in
being
under
some
circumstances
contagious
as
well
as
infectious

p
the
italian
naturalist
filippi
discovered
in
the
blood
of
the
silkworms
affected
by
this
strange
disorder
a
multitude
of
cylindrical
corpuscles
each
about
of
an
inch
long
these
have
been
carefully
studied
by
lebert
and
named
by
him
for
the
reason
that
in
subjects
in
which
the
disease
is
strongly
developed
the
corpuscles
swarm
in
every
tissue
and
organ
of
the
body
and
even
pass
into
the
undeveloped
eggs
of
the
female
moth
but
are
these
corpuscles
causes
or
mere
concomitants
of
the
disease
some
naturalists
took
one
view
and
some
another
and
it
was
not
until
the
french
government
alarmed
by
the
continued
ravages
of
the
malady
and
the
inefficiency
of
the
remedies
which
had
been
suggested
despatched
pasteur
to
study
it
that
the
question
received
its
final
settlement
at
a
great
sacrifice
not
only
of
the
time
and
peace
of
mind
of
that
eminent
philosopher
but
i
regret
to
have
to
add
of
his
health
but
the
sacrifice
has
not
been
in
vain
it
is
now
certain
that
this
devastating
pébrine
is
the
effect
of
the
growth
and
multiplication
of
the
in
the
silkworm
it
is
contagious
and
infectious
because
the
corpuscles
of
the
pass
away
from
the
bodies
of
the
diseased
caterpillars
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
alimentary
canal
of
healthy
silkworms
in
their
neighbourhood
it
is
hereditary
because
the
corpuscles
enter
into
the
eggs
while
they
are
being
formed
and
consequently
are
carried
within
them
when
they
are
laid
and
for
this
reason
also
it
presents
the
very
singular
peculiarity
of
being
inherited
only
on
the
mother
side
there
is
not
a
single
one
of
all
the
apparently
capricious
and
unaccountable
phenomena
presented
by
the
pébrine
but
has
received
its
explanation
from
the
fact
that
the
disease
is
the
result
of
the
presence
of
the
microscopic
organism
such
being
the
facts
with
respect
to
the
pébrine
what
are
the
indications
as
to
the
method
of
preventing
it
it
is
obvious
that
this
depends
upon
the
way
in
which
the
is
generated
if
it
may
be
generated
by
abiogenesis
or
by
xenogenesis
within
the
silkworm
or
its
moth
the
extirpation
of
the
disease
must
depend
upon
the
prevention
of
the
occurrence
of
the
conditions
under
which
this
generation
takes
place
but
if
on
the
other
hand
the
is
an
independent
organism
which
is
no
more
generated
by
the
silkworm
than
the
mistletoe
is
generated
by
the
or
the
oak
on
which
it
grows
though
it
may
need
the
silkworm
for
its
development
in
the
same
way
as
the
mistletoe
needs
the
tree
then
the
indications
are
totally
different
the
sole
thing
to
be
done
is
to
get
rid
of
and
keep
away
the
germs
of
the
as
might
be
imagined
from
the
course
of
his
previous
investigations
pasteur
was
led
to
believe
that
the
latter
was
the
right
theory
and
guided
by
that
theory
he
has
devised
a
method
of
extirpating
the
disease
which
has
proved
to
be
completely
successful
wherever
it
has
been
properly
carried
out
there
can
be
no
reason
then
for
doubting
that
among
insects
contagious
and
infectious
diseases
of
great
malignity
are
caused
by
minute
organisms
which
are
produced
from
germs
or
by
homogenesis
and
there
is
no
reason
that
i
know
of
for
believing
that
what
happens
in
insects
may
not
take
place
in
the
highest
animals
indeed
there
is
already
strong
evidence
that
some
diseases
of
an
extremely
malignant
and
fatal
character
to
which
man
is
subject
are
as
much
the
work
of
minute
organisms
as
is
the
pébrine
i
refer
for
this
evidence
to
the
very
striking
facts
adduced
by
professor
lister
in
his
various
publications
on
the
antiseptic
method
of
treatment
it
appears
to
me
impossible
to
rise
from
the
perusal
of
those
publications
without
a
strong
conviction
that
the
lamentable
mortality
which
so
frequently
dogs
the
footsteps
of
the
most
skilful
operator
and
those
deadly
consequences
of
wounds
and
injuries
which
seem
to
haunt
the
very
walls
of
great
hospitals
and
are
even
now
destroying
more
men
than
die
of
bullet
or
bayonet
are
due
to
the
importation
of
minute
organisms
into
wounds
and
their
increase
and
multiplication
and
that
the
surgeon
who
saves
most
lives
will
be
he
who
best
works
out
the
practical
consequences
of
the
hypothesis
of
redi
i
commenced
this
address
by
asking
you
to
follow
me
in
an
attempt
to
trace
the
path
which
has
been
followed
by
a
scientific
idea
in
its
long
and
slow
progress
from
the
position
of
a
probable
hypothesis
to
that
of
an
established
law
of
nature
our
survey
has
not
taken
us
into
very
attractive
regions
it
has
lain
chiefly
in
a
land
flowing
with
the
abominable
and
peopled
with
mere
grubs
and
mouldiness
and
it
may
be
imagined
with
what
smiles
and
shrugs
practical
and
serious
contemporaries
of
redi
and
of
spallanzani
may
have
commented
on
the
waste
of
their
high
abilities
in
toiling
at
the
solution
of
problems
which
though
curious
enough
in
themselves
could
be
of
no
conceivable
utility
to
mankind
nevertheless
you
will
have
observed
that
before
we
had
travelled
very
far
upon
our
road
there
appeared
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
fields
laden
with
a
harvest
of
golden
grain
immediately
convertible
into
those
things
which
the
most
solidly
practical
men
will
admit
to
have
value
money
and
life
the
direct
loss
to
france
caused
by
the
pébrine
in
seventeen
years
can
not
be
estimated
at
less
than
fifty
millions
sterling
and
if
we
add
to
this
what
redi
idea
in
pasteur
hands
has
done
for
the
and
for
the
and
try
to
capitalise
its
value
we
shall
find
that
it
will
go
a
long
way
towards
repairing
the
money
losses
caused
by
the
frightful
and
calamitous
war
of
this
autumn
and
as
to
the
equivalent
of
redi
thought
in
life
how
can
we
the
value
of
that
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
epidemic
and
epizootic
diseases
and
consequently
of
the
means
of
checking
or
eradicating
them
the
dawn
of
which
has
assuredly
commenced
looking
back
no
further
than
ten
years
it
is
possible
to
select
three
and
in
which
the
total
number
of
deaths
from
fever
alone
amounted
to
ninety
thousand
that
is
the
return
of
killed
the
maimed
and
disabled
being
left
out
of
sight
why
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
list
of
killed
in
the
present
bloodiest
of
all
wars
will
not
amount
to
more
than
this
but
the
facts
which
i
have
placed
before
you
must
leave
the
least
sanguine
without
a
doubt
that
the
nature
and
the
causes
of
this
scourge
will
one
day
be
as
well
understood
as
those
of
the
pébrine
are
now
and
that
the
massacre
of
our
innocents
will
come
to
an
end
and
thus
mankind
will
have
one
more
admonition
that
the
people
perish
for
lack
of
knowledge
and
that
the
alleviation
of
the
miseries
and
the
promotion
of
the
welfare
of
men
must
be
sought
by
those
who
will
not
lose
their
pains
in
that
diligent
patient
loving
study
of
all
the
multitudinous
aspects
of
nature
the
results
of
which
constitute
exact
knowledge
or
science
it
is
the
justification
and
the
glory
of
this
great
meeting
that
it
is
gathered
together
for
no
other
object
than
the
advancement
of
the
moiety
of
science
which
deals
with
those
phenomena
of
nature
which
we
call
physical

its
endeavours
be
crowned
with
a
full
measure
of
success

to
face
facts
and
to
learn
the
exact
quantity
and
quality
of
his
solid
and
reliable
possessions
the
man
of
science
does
well
sometimes
to
imitate
this
procedure
and
forgetting
for
the
time
the
importance
of
his
own
small
winnings
to
examine
the
common
stock
in
trade
so
that
he
may
make
sure
how
far
the
stock
of
bullion
in
the
cellar
on
the
faith
of
whose
existence
so
much
paper
has
been
circulating
is
really
the
solid
gold
of
truth
the
anniversary
meeting
of
the
geological
society
seems
to
be
an
occasion
well
suited
for
an
undertaking
of
this
kind
for
an
inquiry
in
fact
into
the
nature
and
value
of
the
present
results
of
palaeontological
investigation
and
the
more
so
as
all
those
who
have
paid
close
attention
to
the
late
multitudinous
discussions
in
which
palaeontology
is
implicated
must
have
felt
the
urgent
necessity
of
some
such
scrutiny
first
in
order
as
the
most
definite
and
unquestionable
of
all
the
results
of
palaeontology
must
be
mentioned
the
immense
extension
and
impulse
given
to
botany
zoology
and
comparative
anatomy
by
the
investigation
of
fossil
remains
indeed
the
mass
of
biological
facts
has
been
so
greatly
increased
and
the
range
of
biological
speculation
has
been
so
vastly
widened
by
the
researches
of
the
geologist
and
palaeontologist
that
it
is
to
be
feared
there
are
naturalists
in
existence
who
look
upon
geology
as
brindley
regarded
rivers
rivers
said
the
great
engineer
were
made
to
feed
canals
and
geology
some
seem
to
think
was
solely
created
to
advance
comparative
anatomy
were
such
a
thought
justifiable
it
could
hardly
expect
to
be
received
with
favour
by
this
assembly
but
it
is
not
justifiable
your
favourite
science
has
her
own
great
aims
independent
of
all
others
and
if
notwithstanding
her
steady
devotion
to
her
own
progress
she
can
scatter
such
rich
alms
among
her
sisters
it
should
be
remembered
that
her
charity
is
of
the
sort
that
does
not
impoverish
but
blesseth
him
that
gives
and
him
that
takes
regard
the
matter
as
we
will
however
the
facts
remain
nearly
species
of
animals
and
plants
have
been
added
to
the
systema
naturae
by
palaeontological
research
this
is
a
living
population
equivalent
to
that
of
a
new
continent
in
mere
number
equivalent
to
that
of
a
new
hemisphere
if
we
take
into
account
the
small
population
of
insects
as
yet
found
fossil
and
the
large
proportion
and
peculiar
organisation
of
many
of
the
vertebrata
but
beyond
this
it
is
perhaps
not
too
much
to
say
that
except
for
the
necessity
of
interpreting
palaeontological
facts
the
laws
of
distribution
would
have
received
less
careful
study
while
few
comparative
anatomists
and
those
not
of
the
first
order
would
have
been
induced
by
mere
love
of
detail
as
such
to
study
the
minutiae
of
osteology
were
it
not
that
in
such
minutiae
lie
the
only
keys
to
the
most
interesting
riddles
offered
by
the
extinct
animal
world
these
assuredly
are
great
and
solid
gains
surely
it
is
matter
for
no
small
congratulation
that
in
half
a
century
for
palaeontology
though
it
dawned
earlier
came
into
full
day
only
with
cuvier
a
subordinate
branch
of
biology
should
have
doubled
the
value
and
the
interest
of
the
whole
group
of
sciences
to
which
it
belongs
but
this
is
not
all
allied
with
geology
palaeontology
has
established
two
laws
of
inestimable
importance
the
first
that
one
and
the
same
area
of
the
earth
surface
has
been
successively
occupied
by
very
different
kinds
of
living
beings
the
second
that
the
order
of
succession
established
in
one
locality
holds
good
approximately
in
all
the
first
of
these
laws
is
universal
and
irreversible
the
second
is
an
induction
from
a
vast
number
of
observations
though
it
may
possibly
and
even
probably
have
to
admit
of
exceptions
as
a
consequence
of
the
second
law
it
follows
that
a
peculiar
relation
frequently
subsists
between
series
of
strata
containing
organic
remains
in
different
localities
the
series
resemble
one
another
not
only
in
virtue
of
a
general
resemblance
of
the
organic
remains
in
the
two
but
also
in
virtue
of
a
resemblance
in
the
order
and
character
of
the
serial
succession
in
each
there
is
a
resemblance
of
arrangement
so
that
the
separate
terms
of
each
series
as
well
as
the
whole
series
exhibit
a
correspondence
succession
implies
time
the
lower
members
of
an
undisturbed
series
of
sedimentary
rocks
are
certainly
older
than
the
upper
and
when
the
notion
of
age
was
once
introduced
as
the
equivalent
of
succession
it
was
no
wonder
that
correspondence
in
succession
came
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
correspondence
in
age
or
contemporaneity
and
indeed
so
long
as
relative
age
only
is
spoken
of
correspondence
in
succession
correspondence
in
age
it
is
contemporaneity
but
it
would
have
been
very
much
better
for
geology
if
so
loose
and
ambiguous
a
word
as
contemporaneous
had
been
excluded
from
her
terminology
and
if
in
its
stead
some
term
expressing
similarity
of
serial
relation
and
excluding
the
notion
of
time
altogether
had
been
employed
to
denote
correspondence
in
position
in
two
or
more
series
of
strata
in
anatomy
where
such
correspondence
of
position
has
constantly
to
be
spoken
of
it
is
denoted
by
the
word
homology
and
its
derivatives
and
for
geology
which
after
all
is
only
the
anatomy
and
physiology
of
the
earth
it
might
be
well
to
invent
some
single
word
such
as
homotaxis
similarity
of
order
in
order
to
express
an
essentially
similar
idea
this
however
has
not
been
done
and
most
probably
the
inquiry
will
at
once
be
made
to
what
end
burden
science
with
a
new
and
strange
term
in
place
of
one
old
familiar
and
part
of
our
common
language
the
reply
to
this
question
will
become
obvious
as
the
inquiry
into
the
results
of
palaeontology
is
pushed
further
those
whose
business
it
is
to
acquaint
themselves
specially
with
the
works
of
palaeontologists
in
fact
will
be
fully
aware
that
very
few
if
any
would
rest
satisfied
with
such
a
statement
of
the
conclusions
of
their
branch
of
biology
as
that
which
has
just
been
given
our
standard
repertories
of
palaeontology
profess
to
teach
us
far
higher
things
to
disclose
the
entire
succession
of
living
forms
upon
the
surface
of
the
globe
to
tell
us
of
a
wholly
different
distribution
of
climatic
conditions
in
ancient
times
to
reveal
the
character
of
the
first
of
all
living
existences
and
to
trace
out
the
law
of
progress
from
them
to
us
it
may
not
be
unprofitable
to
bestow
on
these
professions
a
somewhat
more
critical
examination
than
they
have
hitherto
received
in
order
to
ascertain
how
far
they
rest
on
an
irrefragable
basis
or
whether
after
all
it
might
not
be
well
for
palaeontologists
to
learn
a
little
more
carefully
that
scientific
ars
artium
the
art
of
saying
i
do
know
and
to
this
end
let
us
define
somewhat
more
exactly
the
extent
of
these
pretensions
of
palaeontology
every
one
is
aware
that
professor
bronn
untersuchungen
and
professor
pictet
traité
de
paléontologie
are
works
of
standard
authority
familiarly
consulted
by
every
working
palaeontologist
it
is
desirable
to
speak
of
these
excellent
books
and
of
their
distinguished
authors
with
the
utmost
respect
and
in
a
tone
as
far
as
possible
removed
from
carping
criticism
indeed
if
they
are
specially
cited
in
this
place
it
is
merely
in
justification
of
the
assertion
that
the
following
propositions
which
may
be
found
implicitly
or
explicitly
in
the
works
in
question
are
regarded
by
the
mass
of
palaeontologists
and
geologists
not
only
on
the
continent
but
in
this
country
as
expressing
some
of
the
established
results
of
palaeontology
thus
animals
and
plants
began
their
existence
together
not
long
after
the
commencement
of
the
deposition
of
the
sedimentary
rocks
and
then
succeeded
one
another
in
such
a
manner
that
totally
distinct
faunae
and
florae
occupied
the
whole
surface
of
the
earth
one
after
the
other
and
during
distinct
epochs
of
time
a
geological
formation
is
the
sum
of
all
the
strata
deposited
over
the
whole
surface
of
the
earth
during
one
of
these
epochs
a
geological
fauna
or
flora
is
the
sum
of
all
the
species
of
animals
or
plants
which
occupied
the
whole
surface
of
the
globe
during
one
of
these
epochs
the
population
of
the
earth
surface
was
at
first
very
similar
in
all
parts
and
only
from
the
middle
of
the
tertiary
epoch
onwards
began
to
show
a
distinct
distribution
in
zones
the
constitution
of
the
original
population
as
well
as
the
numerical
proportions
of
its
members
indicates
a
warmer
and
on
the
whole
somewhat
tropical
climate
which
remained
tolerably
equable
throughout
the
year
the
subsequent
distribution
of
living
beings
in
zones
is
the
result
of
a
gradual
lowering
of
the
general
temperature
which
first
began
to
be
felt
at
the
poles
it
is
not
now
proposed
to
inquire
whether
these
doctrines
are
true
or
false
but
to
direct
your
attention
to
a
much
simpler
though
very
essential
preliminary
question
what
is
their
logical
basis
what
are
the
fundamental
assumptions
upon
which
they
all
logically
depend
and
what
is
the
evidence
on
which
those
fundamental
propositions
demand
our
assent
these
assumptions
are
two
the
first
that
the
commencement
of
the
geological
record
is
coëval
with
the
commencement
of
life
on
the
globe
the
second
that
geological
contemporaneity
is
the
same
thing
as
chronological
synchrony
without
the
first
of
these
assumptions
there
would
of
course
be
no
ground
for
any
statement
respecting
the
commencement
of
life
without
the
second
all
the
other
statements
cited
every
one
of
which
implies
a
knowledge
of
the
state
of
different
parts
of
the
earth
at
one
and
the
same
time
will
be
no
less
devoid
of
demonstration
the
first
assumption
obviously
rests
entirely
on
negative
evidence
this
is
of
course
the
only
evidence
that
ever
can
be
available
to
prove
the
commencement
of
any
series
of
phenomena
but
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
recollected
that
the
value
of
negative
evidence
depends
entirely
on
the
amount
of
positive
corroboration
it
receives
if
wishes
to
prove
an
it
is
of
no
use
for
him
to
get
a
thousand
witnesses
simply
to
swear
that
they
did
not
see
him
in
such
and
such
a
place
unless
the
witnesses
are
prepared
to
prove
that
they
must
have
seen
him
had
he
been
there
but
the
evidence
that
animal
life
commenced
with
the
flags
would
seem
to
be
exactly
of
this
unsatisfactory
uncorroborated
sort
the
cambrian
witnesses
simply
swear
they
seen
anybody
their
way
upon
which
the
counsel
for
the
other
side
immediately
puts
in
ten
or
twelve
thousand
feet
of
devonian
sandstones
to
make
oath
they
never
saw
a
fish
or
a
mollusk
though
all
the
world
knows
there
were
plenty
in
their
time
but
then
it
is
urged
that
though
the
devonian
rocks
in
one
part
of
the
world
exhibit
no
fossils
in
another
they
do
while
the
lower
cambrian
rocks
nowhere
exhibit
fossils
and
hence
no
living
being
could
have
existed
in
their
epoch
to
this
there
are
two
replies
the
first
that
the
observational
basis
of
the
assertion
that
the
lowest
rocks
are
nowhere
fossiliferous
is
an
amazingly
small
one
seeing
how
very
small
an
area
in
comparison
to
that
of
the
whole
world
has
yet
been
fully
searched
the
second
that
the
argument
is
good
for
nothing
unless
the
unfossiliferous
rocks
in
question
were
not
only
in
the
geological
sense
but
in
the
chronological
sense
to
use
the
illustration
again
if
a
man
wishes
to
prove
he
was
in
neither
of
two
places
a
and
b
on
a
given
day
his
witnesses
for
each
place
must
be
prepared
to
answer
for
the
whole
day
if
they
can
only
prove
that
he
was
not
at
a
in
the
morning
and
not
at
b
in
the
afternoon
the
evidence
of
his
absence
from
both
is
nil
because
he
might
have
been
at
b
in
the
morning
and
at
a
in
the
afternoon
thus
everything
depends
upon
the
validity
of
the
second
assumption
and
we
must
proceed
to
inquire
what
is
the
real
meaning
of
the
word
contemporaneous
as
employed
by
geologists
to
this
end
a
concrete
example
may
be
taken
the
lias
of
england
and
the
lias
of
germany
the
cretaceous
rocks
of
britain
and
the
cretaceous
rocks
of
southern
india
are
termed
by
geologists
contemporaneous
formations
but
whenever
any
thoughtful
geologist
is
asked
whether
he
means
to
say
that
they
were
deposited
synchronously
he
says
no
only
within
the
same
great
epoch
and
if
in
pursuing
the
inquiry
he
is
asked
what
may
be
the
approximate
value
in
time
of
a
great
epoch
whether
it
means
a
hundred
years
or
a
thousand
or
a
million
or
ten
million
years
his
reply
is
i
can
not
tell
if
the
further
question
be
put
whether
physical
geology
is
in
possession
of
any
method
by
which
the
actual
synchrony
or
the
reverse
of
any
two
distant
deposits
can
be
ascertained
no
such
method
can
be
heard
of
it
being
admitted
by
all
the
best
authorities
that
neither
similarity
of
mineral
composition
nor
of
physical
character
nor
even
direct
continuity
of
stratum
are
proofs
of
the
synchronism
of
even
approximated
sedimentary
strata
while
for
distant
deposits
there
seems
to
be
no
kind
of
physical
evidence
attainable
of
a
nature
competent
to
decide
whether
such
deposits
were
formed
simultaneously
or
whether
they
possess
any
given
difference
of
antiquity
to
return
to
an
example
already
given
all
competent
authorities
will
probably
assent
to
the
proposition
that
physical
geology
does
not
enable
us
in
any
way
to
reply
to
this
question
were
the
british
cretaceous
rocks
deposited
at
the
same
time
as
those
of
india
or
are
they
a
million
of
years
younger
or
a
million
of
years
older
is
palaeontology
able
to
succeed
where
physical
geology
fails
standard
writers
on
palaeontology
as
has
been
seen
assume
that
she
can
they
take
it
for
granted
that
deposits
containing
similar
organic
remains
are
synchronous
at
any
rate
in
a
broad
sense
and
yet
those
who
will
study
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
chapters
of
sir
henry
de
la
beche
remarkable
researches
in
theoretical
geology
published
now
nearly
thirty
years
ago
and
will
carry
out
the
arguments
there
most
luminously
stated
to
their
logical
consequences
may
very
easily
convince
themselves
that
even
absolute
identity
of
organic
contents
is
no
proof
of
the
synchrony
of
deposits
while
absolute
diversity
is
no
proof
of
difference
of
date
sir
henry
de
la
beche
goes
even
further
and
adduces
conclusive
evidence
to
show
that
the
different
parts
of
one
and
the
same
stratum
having
a
similar
composition
throughout
containing
the
same
organic
remains
and
having
similar
beds
above
and
below
it
may
yet
differ
to
any
conceivable
extent
in
age
edward
forbes
was
in
the
habit
of
asserting
that
the
similarity
of
the
organic
contents
of
distant
formations
was
evidence
not
of
their
similarity
but
of
their
difference
of
age
and
holding
as
he
did
the
doctrine
of
single
specific
centres
the
conclusion
was
as
legitimate
as
any
other
for
the
two
districts
must
have
been
occupied
by
migration
from
one
of
the
two
or
from
an
intermediate
spot
and
the
chances
against
exact
coincidence
of
migration
and
of
imbedding
are
infinite
in
point
of
fact
however
whether
the
hypothesis
of
single
or
of
multiple
specific
centres
be
adopted
similarity
of
organic
contents
can
not
possibly
afford
any
proof
of
the
synchrony
of
the
deposits
which
contain
them
on
the
contrary
it
is
demonstrably
compatible
with
the
lapse
of
the
most
prodigious
intervals
of
time
and
with
the
interposition
of
vast
changes
in
the
organic
and
inorganic
worlds
between
the
epochs
in
which
such
deposits
were
formed
on
what
amount
of
similarity
of
their
faunae
is
the
doctrine
of
the
contemporaneity
of
the
european
and
of
the
north
american
silurians
based
in
the
last
edition
of
sir
charles
lyell
elementary
geology
it
is
stated
on
the
authority
of
a
former
president
of
this
society
the
late
daniel
sharpe
that
between
and
per
cent
of
the
species
of
silurian
mollusca
are
common
to
both
sides
of

us
double
the

number
and
suppose
that

of
the

are

to
the
north

the
british

sixty
per
cent
of

in

is
then
proof
of
contemporaneity

suppose
that
a
million
or
two
of
years
hence
when
britain
has
made
another
dip
beneath
the
sea
and
has
come
up
again
some
geologist
applies
this
doctrine
in
comparing
the
strata
laid
bare
by
the
upheaval
of
the
bottom
say
of
george
channel
with
what
may
then
remain
of
the
suffolk
crag
reasoning
in
the
same
way
he
will
at
once
decide
the
suffolk
crag
and
the
george
channel
beds
to
be
contemporaneous
although
we
happen
to
know
that
a
vast
period
even
in
the
geological
sense
of
time
and
physical
changes
of
almost
unprecedented
extent
separate
the
two
but
if
it
be
a
demonstrable
fact
that
strata
containing
more
than
or
per
cent
of
species
of
mollusca
in
common
and
comparatively
close
together
may
yet
be
separated
by
an
amount
of
geological
time
sufficient
to
allow
of
some
of
the
greatest
physical
changes
the
world
has
seen
what
becomes
of
that
sort
of
contemporaneity
the
sole
evidence
of
which
is
a
similarity
of
facies
or
the
identity
of
half
a
dozen
species
or
of
a
good
many
genera
and
yet
there
is
no
better
evidence
for
the
contemporaneity
assumed
by
all
who
adopt
the
hypothesis
of
universal
faunae
and
florae
of
a
universally
uniform
climate
and
of
a
sensible
cooling
of
the
globe
during
geological
time
there
seems
then
no
escape
from
the
admission
that
neither
physical
geology
nor
palaeontology
possesses
any
method
by
which
the
absolute
synchronism
of
two
strata
can
be
demonstrated
all
that
geology
can
prove
is
local
order
of
succession
it
is
mathematically
certain
that
in
any
given
vertical
linear
section
of
an
undisturbed
series
of
sedimentary
deposits
the
bed
which
lies
lowest
is
the
oldest
in
many
other
vertical
linear
sections
of
the
same
series
of
course
corresponding
beds
will
occur
in
a
similar
order
but
however
great
may
be
the
probability
no
man
can
say
with
absolute
certainty
that
the
beds
in
the
two
sections
were
synchronously
deposited
for
areas
of
moderate
extent
it
is
doubtless
true
that
no
practical
evil
is
likely
to
result
from
assuming
the
corresponding
beds
to
be
synchronous
or
strictly
contemporaneous
and
there
are
multitudes
of
accessory
circumstances
which
may
fully
justify
the
assumption
of
such
synchrony
but
the
moment
the
geologist
has
to
deal
with
large
areas
or
with
completely
separated
deposits
the
mischief
of
confounding
that
homotaxis
or
similarity
of
arrangement
which
be
demonstrated
with
synchrony
or
identity
of
date
for
which
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
proof
under
the
one
common
term
of
contemporaneity
becomes
incalculable
and
proves
the
constant
source
of
gratuitous
speculations
for
anything
that
geology
or
palaeontology
are
able
to
show
to
the
contrary
a
devonian
fauna
and
flora
in
the
british
islands
may
have
been
contemporaneous
with
silurian
life
in
north
america
and
with
a
carboniferous
fauna
and
flora
in
africa
geographical
provinces
and
zones
may
have
been
as
distinctly
marked
in
the
palaeozoic
epoch
as
at
present
and
those
seemingly
sudden
appearances
of
new
genera
and
species
which
we
ascribe
to
new
creation
may
be
simple
results
of
migration
it
may
be
so
it
may
be
otherwise
in
the
present
condition
of
our
knowledge
and
of
our
methods
one
verdict
not
proven
and
not
provable
must
be
recorded
against
all
the
grand
hypotheses
of
the
palaeontologist
respecting
the
general
succession
of
life
on
the

the
order
and
nature
of
terrestrial
life

us
with
most
valuable
topographical
records

lies
to

come
when
these
obligations
will
be
repaid
tenfold
and
when
the
maze
of
the
world
past

through
which
the
pure
geologist
and
the
pure
palaeontologist
find
no
guidance
will
be
securely
threaded
by
the
clue
furnished
by
the
naturalist
all
who
are
competent
to
express
an
opinion
on
the
subject
are
at
present
agreed
that
the
manifold
varieties
of
animal
and
vegetable
form
have
not
either
come
into
existence
by
chance
nor
result
from
capricious
exertions
of
creative
power
but
that
they
have
taken
place
in
a
definite
order
the
statement
of
which
order
is
what
men
of
science
term
a
natural
law
whether
such
a
law
is
to
be
regarded
as
an
expression
of
the
mode
of
operation
of
natural
forces
or
whether
it
is
simply
a
statement
of
the
manner
in
which
a
supernatural
power
has
thought
fit
to
act
is
a
secondary
question
so
long
as
the
existence
of
the
law
and
the
possibility
of
its
discovery
by
the
human
intellect
are
granted
but
he
must
be
a
philosopher
who
believing
in
that
possibility
and
having
watched
the
gigantic
strides
of
the
biological
sciences
during
the
last
twenty
years
doubts
that
science
will
sooner
or
later
make
this
further
step
so
as
to
become
possessed
of
the
law
of
evolution
of
organic
forms
of
the
unvarying
order
of
that
great
chain
of
causes
and
effects
of
which
all
organic
forms
ancient
and
modern
are
the
links
and
then
if
ever
we
shall
be
able
to
begin
to
discuss
with
profit
the
questions
respecting
the
commencement
of
life
and
the
nature
of
the
successive
populations
of
the
globe
which
so
many
seem
to
think
are
already
answered
the
preceding
arguments
make
no
particular
claim
to
novelty
indeed
they
have
been
floating
more
or
less
distinctly
before
the
minds
of
geologists
for
the
last
thirty
years
and
if
at
the
present
time
it
has
seemed
desirable
to
give
them
more
definite
and
systematic
expression
it
is
because
palaeontology
is
every
day
assuming
a
greater
importance
and
now
requires
to
rest
on
a
basis
the
firmness
of
which
is
thoroughly
well
assured
among
its
fundamental
conceptions
there
must
be
no
confusion
between
what
is
certain
and
what
is
more
or
less
probable
but
pending
the
construction
of
a
surer
foundation
than
palaeontology
now
possesses
it
may
be
instructive
assuming
for
the
nonce
the
general
correctness
of
the
ordinary
hypothesis
of
geological
contemporaneity
to
consider
whether
the
deductions
which
are
ordinarily
drawn
from
the
whole
body
of
palaeontological
facts
are
justifiable

the

the
ancient

is
greater
but
still
singularly
small
no
fossil
animal
is
so
distinct
from
those
now
living
as
to
require
to
be
arranged
even
in
a
separate
class
from
those
which
contain

it
is
only
when
we
come
to
the
orders
which
may
be
roughly
estimated
at
about
a
hundred
and
thirty
that
we
meet
with
fossil
animals
so
distinct
from
those
now

for
themselves
and
these
do
not
amount
on
the
most
liberal
estimate
to
more
than
about
per

there
is

there
are
at

pterosauria

and
perhaps
another

there
is

no

of

the
ordinal
distinctness
of
the
toxodontia
being
doubtful
the
objection
that
broad
statements
of
this
kind
after
all
rest
largely
on

evidence
is
obvious
but
it
has
less

might

from

us
through

time
no
species
ordinally
distinct

diversity
of

enormous
lapse
of

indicated
by
the
accumulation

strata
the
only
circumstance
to
be
wondered
at
is
not
that
the
changes
of
life
as
exhibited
by
positive
evidence
have
been
so
great
but
that
they
have
been
so
small
be
they
great
or
small
however
it
is
desirable
to
attempt
to
estimate
them
let
us
therefore
take
each
great
division
of
the
animal
world
in
succession
and
whenever
an
order
or
a
family
can
be
shown
to
have
had
a
prolonged
existence
let
us
endeavour
to
ascertain
how
far
the
later
members
of
the
group
differ
from
the
earlier
ones
if
these
later
members
in
all
or
in
many
cases
exhibit
a
certain
amount
of
modification
the
fact
is
so
far
evidence
in
favour
of
a
general
law
of
change
and
in
a
rough
way
the
rapidity
of
that
change
will
be
measured
by
the
demonstrable
amount
of
modification
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
recollected
that
the
absence
of
any
modification
while
it
may
leave
the
doctrine
of
the
existence
of
a
law
of
change
without
positive
support
can
not
possibly
disprove
all
forms
of
that
doctrine

it
may
afford
a
sufficient
refutation
of

of
them

not

several
of

an

i
have
referred
to
the
coelacanthini
comprising
the

as
affording
an
example
of

it
is
most
remarkable
to
note
the
smallness
of
the
differences
between
any
of

affecting
at
most
the
proportions
of

of

in
what
respect
is
the
of

more
embryonic

than
of

to
turn
to
the
higher
vertebrata
in

sense
are
the
liassic
chelonia
inferior
to
those
which
now
exist
how
are
the
cretaceous
ichthyosauria
plesiosauria
or
pterosauria
less
embryonic
or
more
differentiated

than
those
of

or
lastly
in
what
circumstance
is
the
more
embryonic
or
of
a
more
generalised
type
than
the
modern
opossum
or
a
or
a
than
a
modern
or
these
examples
might
be
almost
indefinitely
multiplied
but
surely
they
are
sufficient
to
prove
that
the
only
safe
and
unquestionable
testimony
we
can
procure
positive
evidence
fails
to
demonstrate
any
sort
of
progressive
modification
towards
a
less
embryonic
or
less
generalised
type
in
a
great
many
groups
of
animals
of
geological
existence
in
these
groups
there
is
abundant
evidence
of
variation
none
of
what
is
ordinarily
understood
as
progression
and
if
the
known
geological
record
is
to
be
regarded
as
even
any
considerable
fragment
of
the
whole
it
is
inconceivable
that
any
theory
of
a
necessarily
progressive
development
can
stand
for
the
numerous
orders
and
families
cited
afford
no
trace
of
such
a
process
but
it
is
a
most
remarkable
fact
that
while
the
groups
which
have
been
mentioned
and
many
besides
exhibit
no
sign
of
progressive
modification
there
are
others
with
them
under
the
same
conditions
in
which
more
or
less
distinct
indications
of
such
a
process
seems
to
be
traceable
among
such
indications
i
may
remind
you
of
the
predominance
of
holostome
gasteropoda
in
the
older
rocks
as
compared
with
that
of
siphonostone
gasteropoda
in
the
later
a
case
less
open
to
the
objection
of
negative
evidence
however
is
that
afforded
by
the
tetrabranchiate
cephalopoda
the
forms
of
the
shells
and
of
the
septal
sutures
exhibiting
a
certain
increase
of
complexity
in
the
newer
genera
here
however
one
is
met
at
once
with
the
occurrence
of
and
at
the
two
ends
of
the
series
and
of
the
fact
that
one
of
the
simplest
genera
is
that
which
now
exists
the
crinoidea
in
the
abundance
of
stalked
forms
in
the
ancient
formations
as
compared
with
their
present
rarity
seem
to
present
us
with
a
fair
case
of
modification
from
a
more
embryonic
towards
a
less
embryonic
condition
but
then
on
careful
consideration
of
the
facts
the
objection
arises
that
the
stalk
calyx
and
arms
of
the
palaeozoic
crinoid
are
exceedingly
different
from
the
corresponding
organs
of
a
larval
and
it
might
with
perfect
justice
be
argued
that
and
for
example
depart
to
the
full
as
widely
in
one
direction
from
the
stalked
embryo
of
as
itself
does
in
the
other
the
echinidea
again
are
frequently
quoted
as
exhibiting
a
gradual
passage
from
a
more
generalised
to
a
more
specialised
type
seeing
that
the
elongated
or
oval
spatangoids
appear
after
the
spheroidal
echinoids
but
here
it
might
be
argued
on
the
other
hand
that
the
spheroidal
echinoids
in
reality
depart
further
from
the
general
plan
and
from
the
embryonic
form
than
the
elongated
spatangoids
do
and
that
the
peculiar
dental
apparatus
and
the
pedicellariae
of
the
former
are
marks
of
at
least
as
great
differentiation
as
the
petaloid
ambulacra
and
semitae
of
the
latter
once
more
the
prevalence
of
macrurous
before
brachyurous
podophthalmia
is
apparently
a
fair
piece
of
evidence
in
favour
of
progressive
modification
in
the
same
order
of
crustacea
and
yet
the
case
will
not
stand
much
sifting
seeing
that
the
macrurous
podophthalmia
depart
as
far
in
one
direction
from
the
common
type
of
podophthalmia
or
from
any
embryonic
condition
of
the
brachyura
as
the
brachyura
do
in
the
other
and
that
the
middle
terms
between
macrura
and
brachyura
the
anomura
are
little
better
represented
in
the
older
mesozoic
rocks
than
the
brachyura
are
none
of
the
cases
of
progressive
modification
which
are
cited
from
among
the
invertebrata
appear
to
me
to
have
a
foundation
less
open
to
criticism
than
these
and
if
this
be
so
no
careful
reasoner
would
i
think
be
inclined
to
lay
very
great
stress
upon
them
among
the
vertebrata
however
there
are
a
few
examples
which
appear
to
be
far
less
open
to
objection
it
is
in
fact
true
of
several
groups
of
vertebrata
which
have
lived
through
a
considerable
range
of
time
that
the
endoskeleton
more
particularly
the
spinal
column
of
the
older
genera
presents
a
less
ossified
and
so
far
less
differentiated
condition
than
that
of
the
younger
genera
thus
the
devonian
ganoids
though
almost
all
members
of
the
same
as
and
presenting
numerous
important
resemblances
to
the
existing
genus
which
possesses
biconclave
vertebrae
are
for
the
most
part
wholly
devoid
of
ossified
vertebral
centra
the
mesozoic
lepidosteidae
again
have
at
most
biconcave
vertebrae
while
the
existing
has
salamandroid
opisthocoelous
vertebrae
so
none
of
the
palaeozoic
sharks
have
shown
themselves
to
be
possessed
of
ossified
vertebrae
while
the
majority
of
modern
sharks
possess
such
vertebrae
again
the
more
ancient
crocodilia
and
lacertilia
have
vertebrae
with
the
articular
facets
of
their
centra
flattened
or
biconcave
while
the
modern
members
of
the
same
group
have
them
procoelous
but
the
most
remarkable
examples
of
progressive
modification
of
the
vertebral
column
in
correspondence
with
geological
age
are
those
afforded
by
the
pycnodonts
among
fish
and
the
labyrinthodonts
among
amphibia
the
late
able
ichthyologist
heckel
pointed
out
the
fact
that
while
the
pycnodonts
never
possess
true
vertebral
centra
they
differ
in
the
degree
of
expansion
and
extension
of
the
ends
of
the
bony
arches
of
the
vertebrae
upon
the
sheath
of
the
notochord
the
carboniferous
forms
exhibiting
hardly
any
such
expansion
while
the
mesozoic
genera
present
a
greater
and
greater
development
until
in
the
tertiary
forms
the
expanded
ends
become
suturally
united
so
as
to
form
a
sort
of
false
vertebra

to
whose
luminous
researches
we
are

for
our

of
the

of

older
labyrinthodonts

proved
that
the
carboniferous
had
very
imperfectly
developed
vertebral

the

had
the

parts
completely
ossified
footnote

this

evidence
lies
before
me
of
the

of
a

and
evenness
of

the

have
also
been
cited
as
exemplifications
of
a
law
of
progressive
development
but
i
know
of
no
other
cases
based
on
positive
evidence
which
are
worthy
of
particular
notice
what
then
does
an
impartial
survey
of
the
positively
ascertained
truths
of
palaeontology
testify
in
relation
to
the
common
doctrines
of
progressive
modification
which
suppose
that
modification
to
have
taken
place
by
a
necessary
progress
from
more
to
less
embryonic
forms
or
from
more
to
less
generalised
types
within
the
limits
of
the
period
represented
by
the
fossiliferous
rocks
it
negatives
those
doctrines
for
it
either
shows
us
no
evidence
of
any
such
modification
or
demonstrates
it
to
have
been
very
slight
and
as
to
the
nature
of
that
modification
it
yields
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
the
earlier
members
of
any
group
were
more
generalised
in
structure
than
the
later
ones
to
a
certain
extent
indeed
it
may
be
said
that
imperfect
ossification
of
the
vertebral
column
is
an
embryonic
character
but
on
the
other
hand
it
would
be
extremely
incorrect
to
suppose
that
the
vertebral
columns
of
the
older
vertebrata
are
in
any
sense
embryonic
in
their
whole
structure
obviously
if
the
earliest
fossiliferous
rocks
now
known
are
coëval
with
the
commencement
of
life
and
if
their
contents
give
us
any
just
conception
of
the
nature
and
the
extent
of
the
earliest
fauna
and
flora
the
insignificant
amount
of
modification
which
can
be
demonstrated
to
have
taken
place
in
any
one
group
of
animals
or
plants
is
quite
incompatible
with
the
hypothesis
that
all
living
forms
are
the
results
of
a
necessary
process
of
progressive
development
entirely
comprised
within
the
time
represented
by
the
fossiliferous
rocks
contrariwise
any
admissible
hypothesis
of
progressive
modification
must
be
compatible
with
persistence
without
progression
through
indefinite
periods
and
should
such
an
hypothesis
eventually
be
proved
to
be
true
in
the
only
way
in
which
it
can
be
demonstrated
viz
by
observation
and
experiment
upon
the
existing
forms
of
life
the
conclusion
will
inevitably
present
itself
that
the
palaeozoic
mesozoic
and
cainozoic
faunae
and
florae
taken
together
bear
somewhat
the
same
proportion
to
the
whole
series
of
living
beings
which
have
occupied
this
globe
as
the
existing
fauna
and
flora
do
to
them
such
are
the
results
of
palaeontology
as
they
appear
and
have
for
some
years
appeared
to
the
mind
of
an
inquirer
who
regards
that
study
simply
as
one
of
the
applications
of
the
great
biological
sciences
and
who
desires
to
see
it
placed
upon
the
same
sound
basis
as
other
branches
of
physical
inquiry
if
the
arguments
which
have
been
brought
forward
are
valid
probably
no
one
in
view
of
the
present
state
of
opinion
will
be
inclined
to
think
the
time
wasted
which
has
been
spent
upon
their
elaboration
x
geological
reform
a
great
reform
in
geological
speculation
seems
now
to
have
become
necessary
it
is
quite
certain
that
a
great
mistake
has
been
made
that
british
popular
geology
at
the
present
time
is
in
direct
opposition
to
the
principles
of
natural
philosophy
footnote
on
geological
time
by
sir
thomson
of
the
geological
society
of
vol
iii
in
reviewing
the
course
of
geological
thought
during
the
past
year
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
those
matters
to
which
i
might
most
fitly
direct
your
attention
in
the
address
which
it
now
becomes
my
duty
to
deliver
from
the
presidential
chair
the
two
somewhat
alarming
sentences
which
i
have
just
read
and
which
occur
in
an
able
and
interesting
essay
by
an
eminent
natural
philosopher
rose
into
such
prominence
before
my
mind
that
they
eclipsed
everything
else
it
surely
is
a
matter
of
paramount
importance
for
the
british
geologists
some
of
them
very
popular
geologists
too
here
in
solemn
annual
session
assembled
to
inquire
whether
the
severe
judgment
thus
passed
upon
them
by
so
high
an
authority
as
sir
william
thomson
is
one
to
which
they
must
plead
guilty
or
whether
they
are
prepared
to
say
not
guilty
and
appeal
for
a
reversal
of
the
sentence
to
that
higher
court
of
educated
scientific
opinion
to
which
we
are
all
amenable
as
your
for
the
time
being
i
thought
i
could
not
do
better
than
get
up
the
case
with
a
view
of
advising
you
it
is
true
that
the
charges
brought
forward
by
the
other
side
involve
the
consideration
of
matters
quite
foreign
to
the
pursuits
with
which
i
am
ordinarily
occupied
but
in
that
respect
i
am
only
in
the
position
which
is
nine
times
out
of
ten
occupied
by
counsel
who
nevertheless
contrive
to
gain
their
causes
mainly
by
force
of
and
aided
by
some
training
in
other
intellectual
exercises
nerved
by
such
precedents
i
proceed
to
put
my
pleading
before
you
and
the
first
question
with
which
i
propose
to
deal
is
what
is
it
to
which
sir
thomson
refers
when
he
speaks
of
geological
speculation
and
british
popular
geology
i
find
three
more
or
less
contradictory
systems
of
geological
thought
each
of
which
might
fairly
enough
claim
these
appellations
standing
side
by
side
in
britain
i
shall
call
one
of
them
catastrophism
another
uniformitarianism
the
third
evolutionism
and
i
shall
try
briefly
to
sketch
the
characters
of
each
that
you
may
say
whether
the
classification
is
or
is
not
exhaustive
by
catastrophism
i
mean
any
form
of
geological
speculation
which
in
order
to
account
for
the
phenomena
of
geology
supposes
the
operation
of
forces
different
in
their
nature
or
immeasurably
different
in
power
from
those
which
we
at
present
see
in
action
in
the
universe
the
mosaic
cosmogony
is
in
this
sense
catastrophic
because
it
assumes
the
operation
of
power
the
doctrine
of
violent
upheavals
and
cataclysms
in
general
is
catastrophic
so
far
as
it
assumes
that
these
were
brought
about
by
causes
which
have
now
no
parallel
there
was
a
time
when
catastrophism
might
have
claimed
the
title
of
british
popular
geology
and
assuredly
it
has
yet
many
adherents
and
reckons
among
its
supporters
some
of
the
most
honoured
members
of
this
society
by
uniformitarianism
i
mean
especially
the
teaching
of
hutton
and
of
lyell
that
great
though
incomplete
work
the
theory
of
the
earth
seems
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
most
remarkable
contributions
to
geology
which
is
recorded
in
the
annals
of
the
science
so
far
as
the
world
is
concerned
uniformitarianism
lies
there
not
only
in
germ
but
in
blossom
and
fruit
if
one
asks
how
it
is
that
hutton
was
led
to
entertain
views
so
far
in
advance
of
those
prevalent
in
his
time
in
some
respects
while
in
others
they
seem
almost
curiously
limited
the
answer
appears
to
me
to
be
plain
hutton
was
in
advance
of
the
geological
speculation
of
his
time
because
in
the
first
place
he
had
amassed
a
vast
store
of
knowledge
of
the
facts
of
geology
gathered
by
personal
observation
in
travels
of
considerable
extent
and
because
in
the
second
place
he
was
thoroughly
trained
in
the
physical
and
chemical
science
of
his
day
and
thus
possessed
as
much
as
any
one
in
his
time
could
possess
it
the
knowledge
which
is
requisite
for
the
just
interpretation
of
geological
phenomena
and
the
habit
of
thought
which
fits
a
man
for
scientific
inquiry
it
is
to
this
thorough
scientific
training
that
i
ascribe
hutton
steady
and
persistent
refusal
to
look
to
other
causes
than
those
now
in

but
other
influences
were
at
work
upon
hutton
beside
those
of
a
mind
logical
by
nature
and
scientific
by
sound
training
and
the
peculiar
turn
which
his
speculations
took
seems
to
me
to
be
unintelligible
unless
these
be
taken
into
account
the
arguments
of
the
french
astronomers
and
mathematicians
which
at
the
end
of
the
last
century
were
held
to
demonstrate
the
existence
of
a
compensating
arrangement
among
the
celestial
bodies
whereby
all
perturbations
eventually
reduced
themselves
to
oscillations
on
each
side
of
a
mean
position
and
the
stability
of
the
solar
system
was
secured
had
evidently
taken
strong
hold
of
mind
in
those
oddly
constructed
periods
which
seem
to
have
prejudiced
many
persons
against
reading
his
works
but
which
are
full
of
that
peculiar
if
unattractive
eloquence
which
flows
from
mastery
of
the
subject
hutton
says
we
have
now
got
to
the
end
of
our
reasoning
we
have
no
data
further
to
conclude
immediately
from
that
which
actually
is
but
we
have
got
enough
we
have
the
satisfaction
to
find
that
in
nature
there
is
wisdom
system
and
consistency
for
having
in
the
natural
history
of
this
earth
seen
a
succession
of
worlds
we
may
from
this
conclude
that
there
is
a
system
in
nature
in
like
manner
as
from
seeing
revolutions
of
the
planets
it
is
concluded
that
there
is
a
system
by
which
they
are
intended
to
continue
those
revolutions
but
if
the
succession
of
worlds
is
established
in
the
system
of
nature
it
is
in
vain
to
look
for
anything
higher
in
the
origin
of
the
earth
the
result
therefore
of
this
physical
inquiry
is
that
we
find
no
vestige

no

yet
another
influence
worked
strongly
upon
hutton
like
most
philosophers
of
his
age
he
coquetted
with
those
final
causes
which
have
been
named
barren
virgins
but
which
might
be
more
fitly
termed
the
of
philosophy
so
constantly
have
they
led
men
astray
the
final
cause
of
the
existence
of
the
world
is
for
hutton
the
production
of
life
and
intelligence
we
have
now
considered
the
globe
of
this
earth
as
a
machine
constructed
upon
chemical
as
well
as
mechanical
principles
by
which
its
different
parts
are
all
adapted
in
form
in
quality
and
in
quantity
to
a
certain
end
an
end
attained
with
certainty
or
success
and
an
end
from
which
we
may
perceive
wisdom
in
contemplating
the
means
employed
but
is
this
world
to
be
considered
thus
merely
as
a
machine
to
last
no
longer
than
its
parts
retain
their
present
position
their
proper
forms
and
qualities
or
may
it
not
be
also
considered
as
an
organised
body
such
as
has
a
constitution
in
which
the
necessary
decay
of
the
machine
is
naturally
repaired
in
the
exertion
of
those
productive
powers
by
which
it
had
been
formed
this
is
the
view
in
which
we
are
now
to
examine
the
globe
to
see
if
there
be
in
the
constitution
of
this
world
a
reproductive
operation
by
which
a
ruined
constitution
may
be
again
repaired

it

me

of

shown
how
unjust
was
the
insinuation

it
would
not
be
unjust
to
say
that
he
persistently
in
practice
shut
his
eyes
to
the
existence
of
that
prior
and
different
state
of
things
which
in
theory
he
admitted
and
in
this
aversion
to
look
beyond
the
veil
of
stratified

lyell
follows
him
hutton
and
lyell

agree
in
their
indisposition

a
step
beyond
the
period
recorded
in
the
most
ancient
strata
now

is
for
hutton
the
point
in
which
we
can
not
see
any
farther

lyell
tells
us
the

may
find
good
reasons
for
ascribing
the

form
to
the
original
fluidity
of
the
mass
in
times
long
antecedent
to
the
first
introduction
of
living
beings
into
the

the
geologist
must
be
content
to
regard
the
earliest
monuments

it
is
his
task
to
interpret
as
belonging
to
a
period
when
the

as
great
as

conceive

the

precisely
the

we
call
its
anatomy

its

the
series
of
changes
which
it
passes
through
to
acquire
its
complete
structure
then
i
find
that
the
living
being
has
certain
powers
resulting
from
its
own
activities
and
the
interaction
of
these
with
the
activities
of
other
things
the
knowledge
of
which
is

beyond
this

living

has
a
position

is
its

these

the
body
of
ascertainable
facts
which
constitute
the
of
the
living

but
these
facts
have
their
causes
and
the
ascertainment
of
these
causes
is
the
doctrine
of
aetiology
if
we
consider
what
is
knowable
about
the
earth
we
shall
find
that
such
if
i
may
so
translate
the
word
geology
falls
into
the
same
categories
what
is
termed
stratigraphical
geology
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
anatomy
of
the
earth
and
the
history
of
the
succession
of
the
formations
is
the
history
of
a
succession
of
such
anatomies
or
corresponds
with
development
as
distinct
from
generation
the
internal
heat
of
the
earth
the
elevation
and
depression
of
its
crust
its
belchings
forth
of
vapours
ashes
and

are
its
activities
in
as
strict
a
sense
as
are

and
the

products

the

winds
of
the
are
as
much
the
results
of
the
reaction
between
these
inner
activities
and
outward
forces
as
are
the
budding
of
the
leaves
in
spring
and
their
falling
in
autumn
the
effects
of
the
interaction
between
the
organisation
of
a
plant
and
the
solar
light
and
heat
and
as
the
study
of
the
activities
of
the
living
being
is
called
its
physiology
so
are
these
phenomena
the
of
an
analogous
telluric
physiology
to
which
we
sometimes
give
the
name
of
meteorology
sometimes
that
of
physical
geography
sometimes
that
of
geology
again
the
earth
has
a
place
in
space
and
in
time
and
relations
to
other
bodies
in
both
these
respects
which
constitute
its
distribution
this
subject
is
usually
left
to
the
astronomer
but
a
knowledge
of
its
broad
outlines
seems
to
me
to
be
an
essential
constituent
of
the
stock
of
geological
ideas
all
that
can
be
ascertained
concerning
the
structure
succession
of
conditions
actions
and
position
in
space
of
the
earth
is
the
matter
of
fact
of
its
natural
history
but
as
in
biology
there
remains
the
matter
of
reasoning
from
these
facts
to
their
causes
which
is
just
as
much
science
as
the
other
and
indeed
more
and
this
constitutes
geological
aetiology
having
regard
to
this
general
scheme
of
geological
knowledge
and
thought
it
is
obvious
that
geological
speculation
may
be
so
to
speak
anatomical
and
developmental
speculation
so
far
as
it
relates
to
points
of
stratigraphical
arrangement
which
are
out
of
reach
of
direct
observation
or
it
may
be
physiological
speculation
so
far
as
it
relates
to
undetermined
problems
relative
to
the
activities
of
the
earth
or
it
may
be
distributional
speculation
if
it
deals
with
modifications
of
the
earth
place
in
space
or
finally
it
will
be
aetiological
speculation
if
it
attempts
to
deduce
the
history
of
the
world
as
a
whole
from
the
known
properties
of
the
matter
of
the
earth
in
the
conditions
in
which
the
earth
has
been
placed
for
the
purposes
of
the
present
discourse
i
may
take
this
last
to
be
what
is
meant
by
geological
speculation
now
uniformitarianism
as
we
have
seen
tends
to
ignore
geological
speculation
in
this
sense
altogether
the
one
point
the
catastrophists
and
the
uniformitarians
agreed
upon
when
this
society
was
founded
was
to
ignore
it
and
you
will
find
if
you
look
back
into
our
records
that
our
revered
fathers
in
geology
plumed
themselves
a
good
deal
upon
the
practical
sense
and
wisdom
of
this
proceeding
as
a
temporary
measure
i
do
not
presume
to
challenge
its
wisdom
but
in
all
organised
bodies
temporary
changes
are
apt
to
produce
permanent
effects
and
as
time
has
slipped
by
altering
all
the
conditions
which
may
have
made
such
mortification
of
the
scientific
flesh
desirable
i
think
the
effect
of
the
stream
of
cold
water
which
has
steadily
flowed
over
geological
speculation
within
these
walls
has
been
of
doubtful
beneficence

supposes
a

set

must
result

reclaiming
more

what

in

details
of
kant
speculations
whether
cosmological
or
specially
telluric
in
their
application
but
for
all
that
he
seems
to
me
to
have
been
the
first
person
to
frame
a
complete
system
of
geological
speculation
by
founding
the
doctrine
of
evolution
with
as
much
truth
as
hutton
kant
could
say
i
take
things
just
as
i
find
them
at
present
and
from
these
i
reason
with
regard
to
that
which
must
have
been
like
hutton
he
is
never
tired
of
pointing
out
that
in
nature
there
is
wisdom
system
and
consistency
and
as
in
these
great
principles
so
in
believing
that
the
cosmos
has
a
reproductive
operation
by
which
a
ruined
constitution
may
be
repaired
he
forestalls
hutton
while
on
the
other
hand
kant
is
true
to
science
he
knows
no
bounds
to
geological
speculation
but
those
of
the
intellect
he
reasons
back
to
a
beginning
of
the
present
state
of
things
he
admits
the
possibility
of
an
end
i
have
said
that
the
three
schools
of
geological
speculation
which
i
have
termed
catastrophism
uniformitarianism
and
evolutionism
are
commonly
supposed
to
be
antagonistic
to
one
another
and
i
presume
it
will
have
become
obvious
that
in
my
belief
the
last
is
destined
to
swallow
up
the
other
two
but
it
is
proper
to
remark
that
each
of
the
latter
has
kept
alive
the
tradition
of
precious
truths
catastrophism
has
insisted
upon
the
existence
of
a
practically
unlimited
bank
of
force
on
which
the
theorist
might
draw
and
it
has
cherished
the
idea
of
the
development
of
the
earth
from
a
state
in
which
its
form
and
the
forces
which
it
exerted
were
very
different
from
those
we
now
know
that
such
difference
of
form
and
power
once
existed
is
a
necessary
part
of
the
doctrine
of
evolution
uniformitarianism
on
the
other
hand
has
with
equal
justice
insisted
upon
a
practically
unlimited
bank
of
time
ready
to
discount
any
quantity
of
hypothetical
paper
it
has
kept
before
our
eyes
the
power
of
the
infinitely
little
time
being
granted
and
has
compelled
us
to
exhaust
known
causes
before
flying
to
the
unknown
to
my
mind
there
appears
to
be
no
sort
of
necessary
theoretical
antagonism
between
catastrophism
and
uniformitarianism
on
the
contrary
it
is
very
conceivable
that
catastrophes
may
be
part
and
parcel
of
uniformity
let
me
illustrate
my
case
by
analogy
the
working
of
a
clock
is
a
model
of
uniform
action
good
means
uniformity
of
action
but
the
striking
of
the
clock
is
essentially
a
catastrophe
the
hammer
might
be
made
to
blow
up
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
or
turn
on
a
deluge
of
water
and
by
proper
arrangement
the
clock
instead
of
marking
the
hours
might
strike
at
all
sorts
of
irregular
periods
never
twice
alike
in
the
intervals
force
or
number
of
its
blows
nevertheless
all
these
irregular
and
apparently
lawless
catastrophes
would
be
the
result
of
an
absolutely
uniformitarian
action
and
we
might
have
two
schools
of
one
studying
the
hammer
and
the
other
the
pendulum
still
less
is
there
any
necessary
antagonists
between
either
of
these
doctrines
and
that
of
evolution
which
embraces
all
that
is
sound
in
both
catastrophism
and
uniformitarianism
while
it
rejects
the
arbitrary
assumptions
of
the
one
and
the
as
arbitrary
limitations
of
the
other
nor
is
the
value
of
the
doctrine
of
evolution
to
the
philosophic
thinker
diminished
by
the
fact
that
it
applies
the
same
method
to
the
living
and
the
world
and
embraces
in
one
stupendous
analogy
the
growth
of
a
solar
system
from
molecular
chaos
the
shaping
of
the
earth
from
the
nebulous
of
its
youth
through
innumerable
changes
and
immeasurable
ages
to
its
present
form
and
the
development
of
a
living
being
from
the
shapeless
mass
of
protoplasm
we
term
a
germ
i
do
not
know
whether
evolutionism
can
claim
that
amount
of
currency
which
would
entitle
it
to
be
called
british
popular
geology
but
more
or
less
vaguely
it
is
assuredly
present
in
the
minds
of
most
geologists
such
being
the
three
phases
of
geological
speculation
we
are
now
in
position
to
inquire
which
of
these
it
is
that
sir
william
thomson
calls
upon
us
to
reform
in
the
passages
which
i
have
cited
it
is
obviously
uniformitarianism
which
the
distinguished
physicist
takes
to
be
the
representative
of
geological
speculation
in
general
and
thus
a
first
issue
is
raised
inasmuch
as
many
persons
and
those
not
the
least
thoughtful
among
the
younger
geologists
do
not
accept
strict
uniformitarianism
as
the
final
form
of
geological
speculation
we
should
say
if
hutton
and
playfair
declare
the
course
of
the
world
to
have
been
always
the
same
point
out
the
fallacy
by
all
means
but
in
so
doing
do
not
imagine
that
you
are
proving
modern
geology
to
be
in
opposition
to
natural
philosophy
i
do
not
suppose
that
at
the
present
day
any
geologist
would
be
found
to
maintain
absolute
uniformitarianism
to
deny
that
the
rapidity
of
the
rotation
of
the
earth
be
diminishing
that
the
sun
be
waxing
dim
or
that
the
earth
itself
be
cooling
most
of
us
i
suspect
are
gallios
who
care
for
none
of
these
things
being
of
opinion
that
true
or
fictitious
they
have
made
no
practical
difference
to
the
earth
during
the
period
of
which
a
record
is
preserved
in
stratified
deposits
the
accusation
that
we
have
been
running
counter
to
the
of
natural
philosophy
therefore
is
devoid
of
foundation
the
only
question
which
can
arise
is
whether
we
have
or
have
not
been
tacitly
making
assumptions
which
are
in
opposition
to
certain
conclusions
which
may
be
drawn
from
those
principles
and
this
question
subdivides
itself
into
two
the
first
are
we
really
contravening
such
conclusions
the
second
if
we
are
are
those
conclusions
so
firmly
based
that
we
may
not
contravene
them
i
reply
in
the
negative
to
both
these
questions
and
i
will
give
you
my
reasons
for
so
doing
sir
william
thomson
believes
that
he
is
able
to
prove
by
physical
reasonings
that
the
existing
state
of
things
on
the
earth
life
on
the
earth
all
geological
history
showing
continuity
of
life
must
be
limited
within
some
such
period
of
time
as
one
hundred
million
years
the
first
inquiry
which
arises
plainly
is
has
it
ever
been
denied
that
this
period
be
enough
for
the
purposes
of
geology
the
discussion
of
this
question
is
greatly
embarrassed
by
the
vagueness
with
which
the
assumed
limit
is
i
will
not
say
defined
but
indicated
some
such
period
of
past
time
as
one
hundred
million
years
now
does
this
mean
that
it
may
have
been
two
or
three
or
four
hundred
million
years
because
this
really
makes
all
the
difference
footnote
sir
william
thomson
implies
that
the
precise
time
is
of
no
consequence
the
principle
is
the
same
but
as
the
principle
is
admitted
the
whole
discussion
turns
on
its
practical
results
i
presume
that
feet
may
be
taken
as
a
full
allowance
for
the
total
thickness
of
stratified
rocks
containing
traces
of
life
divided
by
consequently
the
deposit
of
feet
of
stratified
rock
in
years
means
that
the
deposit
has
taken
place
at
the
rate
of
of
a
foot
or
say
of
an
inch
per
annum
well
i
do
not
know
that
any
one
is
prepared
to
maintain
that
even
making
all
needful
allowances
the
stratified
rocks
may
not
have
been
formed
on
the
average
at
the
rate
of
of
an
inch
per
annum
i
suppose
that
if
such
could
be
shown
to
be
the
limit
of
we
could
put
up
with
the
allowance
without
feeling
that
our
speculations
had
undergone
any
revolution
and
perhaps
after
all
the
qualifying
phrase
some
such
period
may
not
necessitate
the
assumption
of
more
than
or
or
of
an
inch
of
deposit
per
year
which
of
course
would
give
us
still
more
ease
and
comfort
but
it
may
be
said
that
it
is
biology
and
not
geology
which
asks
for
so
much
time
that
the
succession
of
life
demands
vast
intervals
but
this
appears
to
me
to
be
reasoning
in
a
circle
biology
takes
her
time
from
geology
the
only
reason
we
have
for
believing
in
the
slow
rate
of
the
change
in
living
forms
is
the
fact
that
they
persist
through
a
series
of
deposits
which
geology
informs
us
have
taken
a
long
while
to
make
if
the
geological
clock
is
wrong
all
the
naturalist
will
have
to
do
is
to
modify
his
notions
of
the
rapidity
of
change
accordingly
and
i
venture
to
point
out
that
when
we
are
told
that
the
limitation
of
the
period
during
which
living
beings
have
inhabited
this
planet
to
one
two
or
three
hundred
million
years
requires
a
complete
revolution
in
geological
speculation
the
rests
on
the
maker
of
the
assertion
who
brings
forward
not
a
shadow
of
evidence
in
its
support
thus
if
we
accept
the
limitation
of
time
placed
before
us
by
sir
thomson
it
is
not
obvious
on
the
face
of
the
matter
that
we
shall
have
to
alter
or
reform
our
ways
in
any
appreciable
degree
and
we
may
therefore
proceed
with
much
calmness
and
indeed
much
indifference
as
to
the
result
to
inquire
whether
that
limitation
is
justified
by
the
arguments
employed
in
its
support
these
arguments
are
three
in
i
the
first
is
based
upon
the
undoubted
fact
that
the
tides
tend
to
retard
the
rate
of
the
earth
rotation
upon
its
axis
that
this
must
be
so
is
obvious
if
one
considers
roughly
that
the
tides
result
from
the
pull
which
the
sun
and
the
moon
exert
upon
the
sea
causing
it
to
act
as
a
sort
of
break
upon
the
rotating
solid
earth
kant
who
was
by
no
means
a
mere
abstract
philosopher
but
a
good
mathematician
and
well
versed
in
the
physical
science
of
his
time
not
only
proved
this
in
an
essay
of
exquisite
clearness
and
intelligibility
now
more
than
a
century
old
but
deduced
from
it
some
of
its
more
important
consequences
such
as
the
constant
turning
of
one
face
of

towards
the

that
tendency
which
is
all
with
which
we

at

concerned
the
facts
bearing
on
this
point
appear
to
stand
as
follows
it
is
a
matter
of
observation
that
the
moon
mean
motion
is
and
has
for
the
last
years
been
undergoing
an
acceleration
relatively
to
the
rotation
of
the
earth
of
course
this
may
result
from
one
of
two
causes
the
moon
may
really
have
been
moving
more
swiftly
in
its
orbit
or
the
earth
may
have
been
rotating
more
slowly
on
its
axis
laplace
believed
he
had
accounted
for
this
phenomenon
by
the
fact
that
the
eccentricity
of
the
earth
orbit
has
been
diminishing
throughout
these
years
this
would
produce
a
diminution
of
the
mean
attraction
of
the
sun
on
the
moon
or
in
other
words
an
increase
in
the
attraction
of
the
earth
on
the
moon
and
consequently
an
increase
in
the
rapidity
of
the
orbital
motion
of
the
latter
body
laplace
therefore
laid
the
responsibility
of
the
acceleration
upon
the
moon
and
if
his
views
were
correct
the
tidal
retardation
must
either
be
insignificant
in
amount
or
be
counteracted
by
some
other
agency
our
great
astronomer
adams
however
appears
to
have
found
a
flaw
in
laplace
calculation
and
to
have
shown
that
only
half
the
observed
retardation
could
be
accounted
for
in
the
way
he
had
suggested
there
remains
therefore
the
other
half
to
be
accounted
for
and
here
in
the
absence
of
all
positive
knowledge
three
sets
of
hypotheses
have
been

that
the

is

tidal
retardation

thomson
and
tait
work
out
this
suggestion
and
on
a
certain
assumption
as
to
the
proportion
of
retardations
due
to
the
sun
and
moon
find
the
earth
may
lose
seconds
of
time
in
a
century
from
this
cause
footnote
sir
thomson
p
but
dufour
suggests
that
the
retardation
of
the
earth
which
is
hypothetically
assumed
to
exist
may
be
due
in
part
or
wholly
to
the
increase
of
the
moment
of
inertia
of
the
earth
by
meteors
falling
upon
its
surface
this
suggestion
also
meets
with
the
entire
approval
of
sir
thomson
who
shows
that
accumulating
at
the
rate
of
one
foot
in
years
would
account
for
the
remainder
of
retardation
footnote
p
thirdly
sir
thomson
brings
forward
an
hypothesis
of
his
own
with
respect
to
the
cause
of
the
hypothetical
retardation
of
the
rotation
let
us
suppose
ice
to
melt
from
the
polar
regions
round
each
pole
we
may
say
to
the
extent
of
something
more
than
a
foot
thick
enough
to
give
foot
of
water
over
those
areas
or
of
a
foot
of
water
if
spread
over
the
whole
globe
which
would
in
reality
raise
the
by
only
some
such
undiscoverable
difference
as
of
an
inch
or
an
inch
this
or
the
reverse
which
we
believe
might
happen
any
year
and
could
certainly
not
be
detected
without
far
more
accurate
observations
and
calculations
for
the
mean
than
any
hitherto
made
would
slacken
or
quicken
the
earth
rate
as
a
timekeeper
by
tenth
of
a
second
per
year
footnote
i
do
not
presume
to
throw
the
slightest
doubt
upon
the
accuracy
of
any
of
the
calculations
made
by
such
distinguished
mathematicians
as
those
who
have
made
the
suggestions
i
have
cited
on
the
contrary
it
is
necessary
to
my
argument
to
assume
that
they
are
all
correct
but
i
desire
to
point
out
that
this
seems
to
be
one
of
the
many
cases
in
which
the
admitted
accuracy
of
mathematical
process
is
allowed
to
throw
a
wholly
inadmissible
appearance
of
authority
over
the
results
obtained
by
them
mathematics
may
be
compared
to
a
mill
of
exquisite
workmanship
which
grinds
you
stuff
of
any
degree
of
fineness
but
nevertheless
what
you
get
out
depends
upon
what
you
put
in
and
as
the
grandest
mill
in
the
world
will
not
extract
from
peascods
so
pages
of
formulae
will
not
get
a
definite
result
out
of
loose
data
in
the
present
instance
it
appears
to
be
admitted
that
it
is
not
absolutely
certain
after
all
whether
the
moon
mean
motion
is
undergoing
acceleration
or
the
earth
rotation
retardation
and
yet
this
is
the
key
of
the
whole
position
footnote
it
will
be
understood
that
i
do
not
wish
to
deny
that
the
earth
rotation
undergoing
retardation
if
the
rapidity
of
the
earth
rotation
is
diminishing
it
is
not
certain
how
much
of
that
retardation
is
due
to
tidal
friction
how
much
to
meteors
how
much
to
possible
excess
of
melting
over
accumulation
of
polar
ice
during
the
period
covered
by
observation
which
amounts
at
the
outside
to
not
more
than
years
the
effect
of
a
different
distribution
of
land
and
water
in
modifying
the
retardation
caused
by
tidal
friction
and
of
reducing
it
under
some
circumstances
to
a
minimum
does
not
appear
to
be
taken
into
account
during
the
miocene
epoch
the
polar
ice
was
certainly
many
feet
thinner
than
it
has
been
during
or
since
the
glacial
epoch
sir
thomson
tells
us
that
the
accumulation
of
something
more
than
a
foot
of
ice
around
the
poles
which
implies
the
withdrawal
of
say
an
inch
of
water
from
the
general
surface
of
the
sea
will
cause
the
earth
to
rotate
quicker
by
of
a
second
per
annum
it
would
appear
therefore
that
the
earth
may
have
been
rotating
throughout
the
whole
period
which
has
elapsed
from
the
commencement
of
the
glacial
epoch
down
to
the
present
time
one
or
more
seconds
per
annum
quicker
than
it
rotated
during
the
miocene
epoch
but
according
to
sir
thomson
calculation
tidal
retardation
will
only
account
for
a
retardation
of
in
a
century
or
say
of
a
second
per
annum
thus
assuming
that
the
accumulation
of
polar
ice
since
the
miocene
epoch
has
only
been
sufficient
to
produce
ten
times
the
effect
of
a
coat
of
ice
one
foot
thick
we
shall
have
an
accelerating
cause
which
covers
all
the
loss
from
tidal
action
and
leaves
a
balance
of
of
a
second
per
annum
in
the
way
of
acceleration
if
tidal
retardation
can
be
thus
checked
and
overthrown
by
other
temporary
conditions
what
becomes
of
the
confident
assertion
based
upon
the
assumed
uniformity
of
tidal
retardation
that
ten
thousand
million
years
ago
the
earth
must
have
been
rotating
more
than
twice
as
fast
as
at
present
and
therefore
that
we
geologists
are
in
direct
opposition
to
the
principles
of
natural
philosophy
if
we
spread
geological
history
over
that
time
ii
the
second
argument
is
thus
stated
by
sir
thomson
an
article
by
myself
published
in
magazine
for
march
on
the
age
of
the
sun
heat
explains
results
of
investigation
into
various
questions
as
to
possibilities
regarding
the
amount
of
heat
that
the
sun
could
have
dealing
with
it
as
you
would
with
a
stone
or
a
piece
of
matter
only
taking
into
account
the
sun
dimensions
which
showed
it
to
be
possible
that
the
sun
may
have
already
illuminated
the
earth
for
as
many
as
one
hundred
million
years
but
at
the
same
time
rendered
it
almost
certain
that
he
had
not
illuminated
the
earth
for
five
hundred
millions
of
years
the
estimates
here
are
necessarily
very
vague
but
yet
vague
as
they
are
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
possible
upon
any
reasonable
estimate
founded
on
known
properties
of
matter
to
say
that
we
can
believe
the
sun
has
really
illuminated
the
earth
for
five
hundred
million
years
footnote
p
i
do
not
wish
to
hansardise
sir
william
thomson
by
laying
much
stress
on
the
fact
that
only
fifteen
years
ago
he
entertained
a
totally
different
view
of
the
origin
of
the
sun
heat
and
believed
that
the
energy
radiated
from
year
to
year
was
supplied
from
year
to
year
a
doctrine
which
would
have
suited
hutton
perfectly
but
the
fact
that
so
eminent
a
physical
philosopher
has
thus
recently
held
views
opposite
to
those
which
he
now
entertains
and
that
he
confesses
his
own
estimates
to
be
very
vague
justly
entitles
us
to
disregard
those
estimates
if
any
distinct
facts
on
our
side
go
against
them
however
i
am
not
aware
that
such
facts
exist
as
i
have
already
said
for
anything
i
know
one
two
or
three
hundred
millions
of
years
may
serve
the
needs
of
geologists
perfectly
well
iii
the
third
line
of
argument
is
based
upon
the
temperature
of
the
interior
of
the
earth
sir
thomson
refers
to
certain
investigations
which
prove
that
the
present
thermal
condition
of
the
interior
of
the
earth
implies
either
a
heating
of
the
earth
within
the
last
years
of
as
much
as
or
a
greater
heating
all
over
the
surface
at
some
time
further
back
than
years
and
then
proceeds
thus
now
are
geologists
prepared
to
admit
that
at
some
time
within
the
last
years
there
has
been
all
over
the
earth
so
high
a
temperature
as
that
i
presume
not
no
geologist
no
geologist
would
for
a
moment
admit
the
hypothesis
that
the
present
state
of
underground
heat
is
due
to
a
heating
of
the
surface
at
so
late
a
period
as
years
ago
if
that
is
not
admitted
we
are
driven
to
a
greater
heat
at
some
time
more
than
years
ago
a
greater
heating
all
over
the
surface
than
fahrenheit
would
kill
nearly
all
existing
plants
and
animals
i
may
safely
say
are
modern
geologists
prepared
to
say
that
all
life
was
killed
off
the
earth
or
years
ago
for
the
uniformity
theory
the
further
back
the
time
of
high
is
put
the
better
but
the
further
back
the
time
of
heating
the
hotter
it
must
have
been
the
best
for
those
who
draw
most
largely
on
time
is
that
which
puts
it
furthest
back
and
that
is
the
theory
that
the
heating
was
enough
to
melt
the
whole
but
even
if
it
was
enough
to
melt
the
whole
we
must
still
admit
some
limit
such
as
fifty
million
years
one
hundred
million
years
or
two
or
three
hundred
million
years
ago
beyond
that
we
can
not
go
footnote
p
it
will
be
observed
that
the
limit
is
once
again
of
the
vaguest
ranging
from
years
to
and
the
reply
is
once
more
that
for
anything
that
can
be
proved
to
the
contrary
one
or
two
hundred
million
years
might
serve
the
purpose
even
of
a
thoroughgoing
huttonian
uniformitarian
very
well
but
if
on
the
other
hand
the
or
years
appear
to
be
insufficient
for
geological
purposes
we
must
closely
criticise
the
method
by
which
the
limit
is
reached
the
argument
is
simple
enough
the
earth
to
be
nothing
but
a
cooling
mass
the
quantity
of
heat
lost
per
year
the
rate
of
cooling
to
have
been
uniform
multiplied
by
any
given
number
of
years
will
be
given
the
minimum
temperature
that
number
of
years
ago
but
is
the
earth
nothing
but
a
cooling
mass
like
a
jar
such
as
is
used
in
carriages
or
a
globe
of
sandstone
and
has
its
cooling
been
uniform
an
affirmative
answer
to
both
these
questions
seems
to
be
necessary
to
the
validity
of
the
calculations
on
which
sir
thomson
lays
so
much
stress
nevertheless
it
surely
may
be
urged
that
such
affirmative
answers
are
purely
hypothetical
and
that
other
suppositions
have
an
equal
right
to
consideration
for
example
is
it
not
possible
that
at
the
prodigious
temperature
which
would
seem
to
exist
at
miles
below
the
surface
all
the
metallic
bases
may
behave
as
mercury
does
at
a
red
heat
when
it
refuses
to
combine
with
oxygen
while
nearer
the
surface
and
therefore
at
a
lower
temperature
they
may
enter
into
combination
as
mercury
does
with
oxygen
a
few
degrees
below
its
and
so
give
rise
to
a
heat
totally
distinct
from
that
which
they
possess
as
cooling
bodies
and
has
it
not
also
been
proved
by
recent
researches
that
the
quality
of
the
atmosphere
may
immensely
affect
its
permeability
to
heat
and
consequently
profoundly
modify
the
rate
of
cooling
the
globe
as
a
whole
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
denied
that
such
conditions
may
exist
and
may
so
greatly
affect
the
supply
and
the
loss
of
terrestrial
heat
as
to
destroy
the
value
of
any
calculations
which
leave
them
out
of
sight
my
functions
as
your
advocate
are
at
an
end
i
speak
with
more
than
the
sincerity
of
a
mere
advocate
when
i
express
the
belief
that
the
case
against
us
has
entirely
broken
down
the
cry
for
reform
which
has
been
raised
without
is
superfluous
inasmuch
as
we
have
long
been
reforming
from
within
with
all
needful
speed
and
the
critical
examination
of
the
grounds
upon
which
the
very
grave
charge
of
opposition
to
the
principles
of
natural
philosophy
has
been
brought
against
us
rather
shows
that
we
have
exercised
a
wise
discrimination
in
declining
for
the
present
to
meddle
with
our
foundations
xi
palaeontology
and
the
doctrine
of
evolution
it
is
now
eight
years
since
in
the
absence
of
the
late
leonard
horner
who
then
presided
over
us
it
fell
to
my
lot
as
one
of
the
secretaries
of
this
society
to
draw
up
the
customary
annual
address
i
availed
myself
of
the
opportunity
to
endeavour
to
take
stock
of
that
portion
of
the
science
of
biology
which
is
commonly
called
palaeontology
as
it
then
existed
and
discussing
one
after
another
the
doctrines
held
by
palaeontologists
i
put
before
you
the
results
of
my
attempts
to
sift
the
from
the
hypothetical
or
the
doubtful
permit
me
briefly
to
recall
to
your
minds
what
those
results
were
the
living
population
of
all
parts
of
the
earth
surface
which
have
yet
been
examined
has
undergone
a
succession
of
changes
which
upon
the
whole
have
been
of
a
slow
and
gradual
character
when
the
fossil
remains
which
are
the
evidences
of
these
successive
changes
as
they
have
occurred
in
any
two
more
or
less
distant
parts
of
the
surface
of
the
earth
are
compared
they
exhibit
a
certain
broad
and
general
parallelism
in
other
words
certain
forms
of
life
in
one
locality
occur
in
the
same
general
order
of
succession
as
or
are
with
similar
forms
in
the
other
locality
homotaxis
is
not
to
be
held
identical
with
synchronism
without
independent
evidence
it
is
possible
that
similar
or
even
identical
faunae
and
florae
in
two
different
localities
may
be
of
extremely
different
ages
if
the
term
age
is
used
in
its
proper
chronological
sense
i
stated
that
geographical
provinces
or
zones
may
have
been
as
distinctly
marked
in
the
palaeozoic
epoch
as
at
present
and
those
seemingly
sudden
appearances
of
new
genera
and
species
which
we
ascribe
to
new
creation
may
be
simple
results
of
migration
the
opinion
that
the
oldest
known
fossils
are
the
earliest
forms
of
life
has
no
solid
foundation
if
we
confine
ourselves
to
positively
ascertained
facts
the
total
amount
of
change
in
the
forms
of
animal
and
vegetable
life
since
the
existence
of
such
forms
is
recorded
is
small
when
compared
with
the
lapse
of
time
since
the
first
appearance
of
these
forms
the
amount
of
change
is
wonderfully
small
moreover
in
each
great
group
of
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
there
are
certain
forms
which
i
termed
persistent
types
which
have
remained
with
but
very
little
apparent
change
from
their
first
appearance
to
the
present
time
in
answer
to
the
question
what
then
does
an
impartial
survey
of
the
positively
ascertained
truths
of
palaeontology
testify
in
relation
to
the
common
doctrines
of
progressive
modification
which
suppose
that
modification
to
have
taken
place
by
a
necessary
progress
from
more
to
less
embryonic
forms
from
more
to
less
generalised
types
within
the
limits
of
the
period
represented
by
the
fossiliferous
rocks
i
reply
it
negatives
these
doctrines
for
it
either
shows
us
no
evidence
of
such
modification
or
demonstrates
such
modification
as
has
occurred
to
have
been
very
slight
and
as
to
the
nature
of
that
modification
it
yields
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
the
earlier
members
of
any
group
were
more
generalised
in
structure
than
the
later
ones
i
think
that
i
can
not
employ
my
last
opportunity
of
addressing
you
officially
more
properly
i
may
say
more
dutifully
than
in
revising
these
old
judgments
with
such
help
as
further
knowledge
and
reflection
and
an
extreme
desire
to
get
at
the
truth
may
afford
me
with
respect
to
the
first
proposition
i
may
remark
that
whatever
may
be
the
case
among
the
physical
geologists
catastrophic
palaeontologists
are
practically
extinct
it
is
now
no
part
of
recognised
geological
doctrine
that
the
species
of
one
formation
all
died
out
and
were
replaced
by
a
set
in
the
next
formation
on
the
contrary
it
is
generally
if
not
universally
agreed
that
the
succession
of
life
has
been
the
result
of
a
slow
and
gradual
replacement
of
species
by
species
and
that
all
appearances
of
abruptness
of
change
are
due
to
breaks
in
the
series
of
deposits
or
other
changes
in
physical
conditions
the
continuity
of
living
forms
has
been
unbroken
from
the
earliest
times
to
the
present
day
the
use
of
the
word
homotaxis
instead
of
synchronism
has
not
so
far
as
i
know
found
much
favour
in
the
eyes
of
geologists
i
hope
therefore
that
it
is
a
love
for
scientific
caution
and
not
mere
personal
affection
for
a
bantling
of
my
own
which
leads
me
still
to
think
that
the
change
of
phrase
is
of
importance
and
that
the
sooner
it
is
made
the
sooner
shall
we
get
rid
of
a
number
of
pitfalls
which
beset
the
reasoner
upon
the
facts
and
theories
of
geology
one
of
the
latest
pieces
of
foreign
intelligence
which
has
reached
us
is
the
information
that
the
austrian
geologists
have
at
last
succumbed
to
the
weighty
evidence
which
barrande
has
accumulated
and
have
admitted
the
doctrine
of
colonies
but
the
admission
of
the
doctrine
of
colonies
implies
the
further
admission
that
even
identity
of
organic
remains
is
no
proof
of
the
synchronism
of
the
deposits
which
contain
them
the
discussions
touching
the
which
commenced
in
have
abundantly
justified
the
fourth
proposition
in
the
oldest
record
of
life
was
in
the
cambrian
rocks
but
if
the
be
as
principal
dawson
and
carpenter
have
shown
so
much
reason
for
believing
the
remains
of
a
living
being
the
discovery
of
its
true
nature
carried
life
back
to
a
period
which
as
sir
william
logan
has
observed
is
as
remote
from
that
during
which
the
cambrian
rocks
were
deposited
as
the
cambrian
epoch
itself
is
from
the
tertiaries
in
other
words
the
ascertained
duration
of
life
upon
the
globe
was
nearly
doubled
at
a
stroke
the
significance
of
persistent
types
and
of
the
small
amount
of
change
which
has
taken
place
even
in
those
forms
which
can
be
shown
to
have
been
modified
becomes
greater
and
greater
in
my
eyes
the
longer
i
occupy
myself
with
the
biology
of
the
past
consider
how
long
a
time
has
elapsed
since
the
miocene
epoch
yet
at
that
time
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
every
important
group
in
every
order
of
the
was
represented
even
the
comparatively
scanty
eocene
fauna
yields
examples
of
the
orders
insectivora
and
of
under
both
the
ruminant
and
the
porcine
modifications
of
and
or
if
we
go
back
to
the
older
half
of
the
mesozoic
epoch
how
truly
surprising
it
is
to
find
every
order
of
the
except
the
represented
while
some
groups
such
as
the
and
the
more
specialised
than
any
which
now
exist
abounded
there
is
one
division
of
the
which
offers
especially
important
evidence
upon
this
point
inasmuch
as
it
bridges
over
the
gap
between
the
mesozoic
and
the
palaeozoic
formations
often
supposed
to
be
of
such
prodigious
magnitude
extending
as
it
does
from
the
bottom
of
the
carboniferous
series
to
the
top
of
the
trias
if
not
into
the
lias
i
refer
to
the
labyrinthodonts
as
the
address
of
was
passing
through
the
press
i
was
able
to
mention
in
a
note
the
discovery
of
a
large
labyrinthodont
with
vertebrae
in
the
edinburgh
since
that
time
eight
or
ten
distinct
genera
of
labyrinthodonts
have
been
discovered
in
the
carboniferous
rocks
of
england
scotland
and
ireland
not
to
mention
the
american
forms
described
by
principal
dawson
and
professor
cope
so
that
at
the
present
time
the
labyrinthodont
fauna
of
the
carboniferous
rocks
is
more
extensive
and
diversified
than
that
of
the
trias
while
its
chief
types
so
far
as
osteology
enables
us
to
judge
are
quite
as
highly
organised
thus
it
is
certain
that
a
comparatively
highly
organised
vertebrate
type
such
as
that
of
the
labyrinthodonts
is
capable
of
persisting
with
no
considerable
change
through
the
period
represented
by
the
vast
deposits
which
constitute
the
carboniferous
the
permian
and
the
triassic
formations
the
very
remarkable
results
which
have
been
brought
to
light
by
the
sounding
and
dredging
operations
which
have
been
carried
on
with
such
remarkable
success
by
the
expeditions
sent
out
by
our
own
the
american
and
the
swedish
governments
under
the
supervision
of
able
naturalists
have
a
bearing
in
the
same
direction
these
investigations
have
demonstrated
the
existence
at
great
depths
in
the
ocean
of
living
animals
in
some
cases
identical
with
in
others
very
similar
to
those
which
are
found
fossilised
in
the
white
chalk
the
cyatholiths
coccospheres
discoliths
in
the
one
are
absolutely
identical
with
those
in
the
other
there
are
identical
or
closely
analogous
species
of
sponges
echinoderms
and
brachiopods
off
the
coast
of
portugal
there
now
lives
a
species
of
which
doubtless
leaves
its
bones
and
scales
here
and
there
in
the
atlantic
ooze
as
its
predecessor
left
its
spoils
in
the
mud
of
the
sea
of
the
cretaceous
epoch
many
years
ago
i
ventured
to
speak
of
the
atlantic
mud
as
modern
chalk
and
i
know
of
no
fact
inconsistent
with
the
view
which
professor
wyville
thomson
has
advocated
that
the
modern
chalk
is
not
only
the
lineal
descendant
of
the
ancient
chalk
but
that
it
remains
so
to
speak
in
the
possession
of
the
ancestral
estate
and
that
from
the
cretaceous
period
if
not
much
earlier
to
the
present
day
the
deep
sea
has
covered
a
large
part
of
what
is
now
the
area
of
the
atlantic
but
if
and
and
not
to
mention
other
forms
of
animals
and
of
plants
thus
bridge
over
the
interval
between
the
present
and
the
mesozoic
periods
is
it
possible
that
the
majority
of
other
living
things
underwent
a
into
something
new
and
strange
all
at
once
footnote
see
an
article
in
the
for
on
chalk
ancient
and
modern
thus
far
i
have
endeavoured
to
expand
and
to
enforce
by
fresh
arguments
but
not
to
modify
in
any
important
respect
the
ideas
submitted
to
you
on
a
former
occasion
but
when
i
come
to
the
propositions
touching
progressive
modification
it
appears
to
me
with
the
help
of
the
new
light
which
has
broken
from
various
quarters
that
there
is
much
ground
for
softening
the
somewhat
severity
with
which
in
i
dealt
with
a
doctrine
for
the
truth
of
which
i
should
have
been
glad
enough
to
be
able
to
find
a
good
foundation
so
far
indeed
as
the
and
the
lower
are
concerned
the
facts
and
the
conclusions
which
are
to
be
drawn
from
them
appear
to
me
to
remain
what
they
were
for
anything
that
as
yet
appears
to
the
contrary
the
earliest
known
marsupials
may
have
been
as
highly
organised
as
their
living
congeners
the
permian
lizards
show
no
signs
of
inferiority
to
those
of
the
present
day
the
labyrinthodonts
can
not
be
placed
below
the
living
salamander
and
triton
the
devonian
ganoids
are
closely
related
to
and
to
but
when
we
turn
to
the
higher
the
results
of
recent
investigations
however
we
may
sift
and
criticise
them
seem
to
me
to
leave
a
clear
balance
in
favour
of
the
doctrine
of
the
evolution
of
living
forms
one
from
another
nevertheless
in
discussing
this
question
it
is
very
necessary
to
discriminate
carefully
between
the
different
kinds
of
evidence
from
fossil
remains
which
are
brought
forward
in
favour
of
evolution
every
fossil
which
takes
an
intermediate
place
between
forms
of
life
already
known
may
be
said
so
far
as
it
is
intermediate
to
be
evidence
in
favour
of
evolution
inasmuch
as
it
shows
a
possible
road
by
which
evolution
may
have
taken
place
but
the
mere
discovery
of
such
a
form
does
not
in
itself
prove
that
evolution
took
place
by
and
through
it
nor
does
it
constitute
more
than
presumptive
evidence
in
favour
of
evolution
in
general
suppose
a
b
c
to
be
three
forms
while
b
is
intermediate
in
structure
between
a
and
then
the
doctrine
of
evolution
offers
four
possible
alternatives
a
may
have
become
c
by
way
of
b
or
c
may
have
become
a
by
way
of
b
or
a
and
c
may
be
independent
modifications
of
b
or
a
b
and
c
may
be
independent
modifications
of
some
unknown
take
the
case
of
the
pigs
the
and
the
ruminants
the
are
intermediate
between
the
first
and
the
last
but
this
does
not
tell
us
whether
the
ruminants
have
come
from
the
pigs
or
the
pigs
from
ruminants
or
both
from
or
whether
pigs
ruminants
and
alike
may
not
have
diverged
from
some
common
stock
but
if
it
can
be
shown
that
a
b
and
c
exhibit
successive
stages
in
the
degree
of
modification
or
specialisation
of
the
same
type
and
if
further
it
can
be
proved
that
they
occur
in
successively
newer
deposits
a
being
in
the
oldest
and
c
in
the
newest
then
the
intermediate
character
of
b
has
quite
another
importance
and
i
should
accept
it
without
hesitation
as
a
link
in
the
genealogy
of
i
should
consider
the
burden
of
proof
to
be
thrown
upon
any
one
who
denied
c
to
have
been
derived
from
a
by
way
of
b
or
in
some
closely
analogous
fashion
for
it
is
always
probable
that
one
may
not
hit
upon
the
exact
line
of
filiation
and
in
dealing
with
fossils
may
mistake
uncles
and
nephews
for
fathers
and
sons
i
think
it
necessary
to
distinguish
between
the
former
and
the
latter
classes
of
intermediate
forms
as
and
when
i
apply
the
former
term
i
merely
mean
to
say
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
form
b
so
named
is
intermediate
between
the
others
in
the
sense
in
which
the
is
intermediate
between
the
pigs
and
the
ruminants
without
either
affirming
or
denying
any
direct
genetic
relation
between
the
three
forms
involved
when
i
apply
the
latter
term
on
the
other
hand
i
mean
to
express
the
opinion
that
the
forms
a
b
and
c
constitute
a
line
of
descent
and
that
b
is
thus
part
of
the
lineage
of
from
the
time
when
cuvier
wonderful
researches
upon
the
extinct
mammals
of
the
paris
gypsum
first
made
intercalary
types
known
and
caused
them
to
be
recognised
as
such
the
number
of
such
forms
has
steadily
increased
among
the
higher
not
only
do
we
now
know
numerous
intercalary
forins
of
but
gaudry
great
monograph
upon
the
fossils
of
pikermi
which
strikes
me
as
one
of
the
most
perfect
pieces
of
palaeontological
work
i
have
seen
for
a
long
time
shows
us
among
the
primates
as
an
intercalary
form
between
the
and
the
and
among
the
and
as
intercalary
or
perhaps
linear
types
between
the
and
the
hardly
any
order
of
the
higher
stands
so
apparently
separate
and
isolated
from
the
rest
as
that
of
the
though
a
careful
consideration
of
the
structure
of
the
pinnipede
or
seals
shows
in
them
many
an
approximation
towards
the
still
more
completely
marine
mammals
the
extinct
however
presents
us
with
an
intercalary
form
between
the
type
of
the
seals
and
that
of
the
whales
the
skull
of
this
great
eocene
in
fact
shows
by
the
narrow
and
prolonged
interorbital
region
the
extensive
union
of
the
parietal
bones
in
a
sagittal
suture
the
nasal
bones
the
distinct
and
large
incisors
implanted
in
premaxillary
bones
which
take
a
full
share
in
bounding
the
fore
part
of
the
gape
the
molar
teeth
with
triangular
and
serrated
crowns
not
exceeding
five
on
each
side
in
each
jaw
and
the
existence
of
a
deciduous
dentition
its
close
relation
with
the
seals
while
on
the
other
hand
the
produced
rostral
form
of
the
snout
the
long
symphysis
and
the
low
coronary
process
of
the
mandible
are
approximations
to
the
cetacean
form
of
those
parts
the
scapula
resembles
that
of
the
cetacean
but
the
spinous
fossa
is
larger
and
more
as
is
the
humerus
which
differs
from
that
of
the
in
presenting
true
articular
surfaces
for
the
free
jointing
of
the
bones
of
the
in
the
apparently
complete
absence
of
hinder
limbs
and
in
the
characters
of
the
vertebral
column
the
lies
on
the
cetacean
side
of
the
boundary
line
so
that
upon
the
whole
the
zeuglodonts
transitional
as
they
are
are
conveniently
retained
in
the
cetacean
order
and
the
publication
in
of
van
beneden
memoir
on
the
miocene
and
pliocene
furnished
much
better
means
than
anatomists
previously
possessed
of
fitting
in
another
link
of
the
chain
which
connects
the
existing
with
the
teeth
are
much
more
numerous
although
the
molars
exhibit
the
zeuglodont
double
fang
the
nasal
bones
are
very
short
and
the
upper
surface
of
the
rostrum
presents
the
groove
filled
up
during
life
by
the
prolongation
of
the
ethmoidal
cartilage
which
is
so
characteristic
of
the
majority
of
the
it
appears
to
me
that
just
as
among
the
existing
the
walruses
and
the
eared
seals
are
intercalary
forms
between
the
fissipede
carnivora
and
the
ordinary
seals
so
the
zeuglodonts
are
intercalary
between
the
as
a
whole
and
the
whether
the
zeuglodonts
are
also
linear
types
in
their
relation
to
these
two
groups
can
not
be
ascertained
until
we
have
more
definite
knowledge
than
we
possess
at
present
respecting
the
relations
in
time
of
the
and
thus
far
we
have
been
concerned
with
the
intercalary
types
which
occupy
the
intervals
between
families
or
orders
of
the
same
class
but
the
investigations
which
have
been
carried
on
by
professor
gegenbaur
professor
cope
and
myself
into
the
structure
and
relations
of
the
extinct
reptilian
forms
of
the
or
and
have
brought
to
light
the
existence
of
intercalary
forms
between
what
have
hitherto
been
always
regarded
as
very
distinct
classes
of
the
vertebrate
namely
and
whatever
inferences
may
or
may
not
be
drawn
from
the
fact
it
is
now
an
established
truth
that
in
many
of
these
the
hind
limbs
and
the
pelvis
are
much
more
similar
to
those
of
birds
than
they
are
to
those
of
reptiles
and
that
these
or
were
more
or
less
completely
bipedal
when
i
addressed
you
in
i
should
have
been
bold
indeed
had
i
suggested
that
palaeontology
would
before
long
show
us
the
possibility
of
a
direct
transition
from
the
type
of
the
lizard
to
that
of
the
ostrich
at
the
present
moment
we
have
in
the
the
intercalary
type
which
proves
that
transition
to
be
something
more
than
a
possibility
but
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
any
of
the
genera
of
with
which
we
are
at
present
acquainted
are
the
actual
linear
types
by
which
the
transition
from
the
lizard
to
the
bird
was
effected
these
very
probably
are
still
hidden
from
us
in
the
older
formations
let
us
now
endeavour
to
find
some
cases
of
true
linear
types
or
forms
which
are
intermediate
between
others
because
they
stand
in
a
direct
genetic
relation
to
them
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
find
clear
and
unmistakable
evidence
of
filiation
among
fossil
animals
for
in
order
that
such
evidence
should
be
quite
satisfactory
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
be
acquainted
with
all
the
most
important
features
of
the
organisation
of
the
animals
which
are
supposed
to
be
thus
related
and
not
merely
with
the
fragments
upon
which
the
genera
and
species
of
the
palaeontologist
are
so
often
based
gaudry
has
arranged
the
species
of
proboscidea
and
in
their
order
of
filiation
from
their
earliest
appearance
in
the
miocene
epoch
to
the
present
time
and
professor
rütimeyer
has
drawn
up
similar
schemes
for
the
oxen
and
other
with
what
i
am
disposed
to
think
is
a
fair
and
probable
approximation
to
the
order
of
nature
but
as
no
one
is
better
aware
than
these
two
learned
acute
and
philosophical
biologists
all
such
arrangements
must
be
regarded
as
provisional
except
in
those
cases
in
which
by
a
fortunate
accident
large
series
of
remains
are
obtainable
from
a
thick
and
widespread
series
of
deposits
it
is
easy
to
accumulate
probabilities
hard
to
make
out
some
particular
case
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
stand
rigorous
criticism
after
much
search
however
i
think
that
such
a
case
is
to
be
made
out
in
favour
of
the
pedigree
of
the
horses
the
genus
is
represented
as
far
back
as
the
latter
part
of
the
miocene
epoch
but
in
deposits
belonging
to
the
middle
of
that
epoch
its
place
is
taken
by
two
other
genera
and
and
in
the
lowest
miocene
and
upper
eocene
only
the
last
genus
occurs
a
species
of
was
referred
by
cuvier
to
the
under
the
name
of
the
are
in
fact
very
similar
in
shape
and
in
pattern
and
in
the
absence
of
any
thick
layer
of
cement
to
those
of
some
species
of
especially
which
has
been
formed
into
a
separate
genus
by
pomel
but
in
the
fact
that
there
are
only
six
sized
grinders
in
the
lower
jaw
the
first
premolar
being
very
small
that
the
anterior
grinders
are
as
large
as
or
rather
larger
than
the
posterior
ones
that
the
second
premolar
has
an
anterior
prolongation
and
that
the
posterior
molar
of
the
lower
jaw
has
as
cuvier
pointed
out
a
posterior
lobe
of
much
smaller
size
and
different
form
the
dentition
of
departs
from
the
type
of

on

he
takes
great
pains
to
distinguish
the

the

of
a
new

it
is
precisely
the
which
is
the
type
of

thus
though

to
me
to
have
a

it
seems
most
convenient
to
adopt
again
the
skeleton
of

extremely

christol
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
description
of
the
bones
of
the
horse
or
the
ass
current
in
veterinary
works
would
fit
those
of
and
in
a
general
way
this
may
be
true
enough
but
there
are
some
most
important
differences
which
indeed
are
justly
indicated
by
the
same
careful
observer
thus
the
ulna
is
complete
throughout
and
its
shaft
is
not
a
mere
rudiment
fused
into
one
bone
with
the
radius
there
are
three
toes
one
large
in
the
middle
and
one
small
on
each
side
the
femur
is
quite
like
that
of
a
horse
and
has
the
characteristic
fossa
above
the
external
condyle
in
the
british
museum
there
is
a
most
instructive
specimen
of
the
showing
that
the
fibula
was
represented
by
the
external
malleolus
and
by
a
flat
tongue
of
bone
which
extends
up
from
it
on
the
outer
side
of
the
tibia
and
is
closely
ankylosed
with
the
latter
bone
the
hind
toes
are
three
like
those
of
the
fore
leg
and
the
middle
metatarsal
bone
is
much
less
compressed
from
side
to
side
than
that
of
the
horse
footnote
i
am
indebted
to
gervais
for
a
specimen
which
indicates
that
the
fibula
was
complete
at
any
rate
in
some
cases
and
for
a
very
interesting
ramps
of
a
mandible
which
shows
that
as
in
the
the
hindermost
of
the
lower
jaw
was
devoid
of
the
posterior
lobe
which
exists
in
the
hindermost
true
molar
in
the
the
teeth
nearly
resemble
those
of
the
horses
though
the
crowns
of
the
grinders
are
not
so
long
like
those
of
the
horses
they
are
abundantly
coated
with
cement
the
shaft
of
the
ulna
is
reduced
to
a
mere
style
ankylosed
throughout
nearly
its
whole
length
with
the
radius
and
appearing
to
be
little
more
than
a
ridge
on
the
surface
of
the
latter
bone
until
it
is
carefully
examined
the
front
toes
are
still
three
but
the
outer
ones
are
more
slender
than
in
and
their
hoofs
smaller
in
proportion
to
that
of
the
middle
toe
they
are
in
fact
reduced
to
mere
and
do
not
touch
the
ground
in
the
leg
the
distal
end
of
the
fibula
is
so
completely
united
with
the
tibia
that
it
appears
to
be
a
mere
process
of
the
latter
bone
as
in
the
horses
in
finally
the
crowns
of
the
become
longer
and
their
patterns
are
slightly
modified
the
middle
of
the
shaft
of
the
ulna
usually
vanishes
and
its
proximal
and
distal
ends
ankylose
with
the
radius
the
phalanges
of
the
two
outer
toes
in
each
foot
disappear
their
metacarpal
and
metatarsal
bones
being
left
as
the
splints
the
has
large
depressions
on
the
face
in
front
of
the
orbits
like
those
for
the
larmiers
of
many
ruminants
but
traces
of
these
are
to
be
seen
in
some
of
the
fossil
horses
from
the
sewalik
hills
and
as
leidy
recent
researches
show
they
are
preserved
in
when
we
consider
these
facts
and
the
further
circumstance
that
the
hipparions
the
remains
of
which
have
been
collected
in
immense
numbers
were
subject
as
gaudry
and
others
have
pointed
out
to
a
great
range
of
variation
it
appears
to
me
impossible
to
resist
the
conclusion
that
the
types
of
the
of
the
and
of
the
ancient
horses
constitute
the
lineage
of
the
modern
horses
the
being
the
intermediate
stage
between
the
other
two
and
answering
to
b
in
my
former
illustration
the
process
by
which
the
has
been
converted
into
is
one
of
specialisation
or
of
more
and
more
complete
deviation
from
what
might
be
called
the
average
form
of
an
ungulate
mammal
in
the
horses
the
reduction
of
some
parts
of
the
limbs
together
with
the
special
modification
of
those
which
are
left
is
carried
to
a
greater
extent
than
in
any
other
hoofed
mammals
the
reduction
is
less
and
the
specialisation
is
less
in
the
and
still
less
in
the
but
yet
as
compared
with
other
mammals
the
reduction
and
specialisation
of
parts
in
the
remain
great
is
it
not
probable
then
that
just
as
in
the
miocene
epoch
we
find
an
ancestral
equine
form
less
modified
than
so
if
we
go
back
to
the
eocene
epoch
we
shall
find
some
quadruped
related
to
the
as
is
related
to
and
consequently
departing
less
from
the
average
form
i
think
that
this
desideratum
is
very
nearly
if
not
quite
supplied
by
remains
of
which
occur
abundantly
in
some
parts
of
the
upper
and
middle
eocene
formations
the
patterns
of
the
of
are
similar
to
those
of
and
their
crowns
are
as
thinly
covered
with
cement
but
the
grinders
diminish
in
size
forwards
and
the
last
lower
molar
has
a
large
hind
lobe
convex
outwards
and
concave
inwards
as
in
the
ulna
is
complete
and
much
larger
than
in
any
of
the
while
it
is
more
slender
than
in
most
of
the
true
it
is
fixedly
united
but
not
ankylosed
with
the
radius
there
are
three
toes
in
the
fore
limb
the
outer
ones
being
slender
but
less
attenuated
than
in
the
the
femur
is
more
like
that
of
the
than
that
of
the
horse
and
has
only
a
small
depression
above
its
outer
condyle
in
the
place
of
the
great
fossa
which
is
so
obvious
in
the
the
fibula
is
distinct
but
very
slender
and
its
distal
end
is
ankylosed
with
the
tibia
there
are
three
toes
on
the
hind
foot
having
similar
proportions
to
those
on
the
fore
foot
the
principal
metacarpal
and
metatarsal
bones
are
flatter
than
they
are
in
any
of
the
and
the
metacarpal
bones
are
longer
than
the
metatarsals
as
in
the
in
its
general
form
resembles
a
very
small
and
slender
horse
and
is
totally
unlike
the
reluctant
creature
depicted
in
cuvier
restoration
of
his
in
the
ossemens
fossiles
footnote
such
at
least
is
the
conclusion
suggested
by
the
proportions
of
the
skeleton
figured
by
cuvier
and
de
blainville
but
perhaps
something
between
a
horse
and
an
agouti
would
be
nearest
the
mark
it
would
be
hazardous
to
say
that
is
the
exact
radical
form
of
the
equine
quadrupeds
but
i
do
not
think
there
can
be
any
reasonable
doubt
that
the
latter
animals
have
resulted
from
the
modification
of
some
quadruped
similar
to
we
have
thus
arrived
at
the
middle
eocene
formation
and
yet
have
traced
back
the
horses
only
to
a
stock
but
these
forms
no
less
than
the
equine
quadrupeds
themselves
present
rudiments
of
the
two
other
toes
which
appertain
to
what
i
have
termed
the
average
quadruped
if
the
expectation
raised
by
the
splints
of
the
horses
that
in
some
ancestor
of
the
horses
these
splints
would
be
found
to
be
complete
digits
has
been
verified
we
are
furnished
with
very
strong
reasons
for
looking
for
a
no
less
complete
verification
of
the
expectation
that
the
avus
of
the
horse
must
have
had
a
atavus
at
some
earlier
period
no
such
atavus
however
has
yet
made
its
appearance
among
the
few
middle
and
older
eocene
which
are
known
another
series
of
closely
affiliated
forms
though
the
evidence
they
afford
is
perhaps
less
complete
than
that
of
the
equine
series
is
presented
to
us
by
the
of
the
eocene
epoch
the
of
the
miocene
and
the
or
deer
of
the
present
day
the
have
no
incisors
in
the
upper
jaw
and
only
six
on
each
side
of
each
jaw
while
the
canine
is
moved
up
to
the
outer
incisor
and
there
is
a
diastema
in
the
lower
jaw
there
are
four
complete
toes
on
the
hind
foot
but
the
middle
metatarsals
usually
become
sooner
or
later
ankylosed
into
a
cannon
bone
the
navicular
and
the
cuboid
unite
and
the
distal
end
of
the
fibula
is
ankylosed
with
the
tibia
in
and
the
upper
incisors
are
fully
developed
there
are
seven
grinders
the
teeth
form
a
continuous
series
without
a
diastema
the
metatarsals
the
navicular
and
cuboid
and
the
distal
end
of
the
fibula
remain
free
in
the
also
the
second
metacarpal
is
developed
but
is
much
shorter
than
the
third
while
the
fifth
is
absent
or
rudimentary
in
this
respect
it
resembles
this
circumstance
and
the
peculiar
pattern
of
the
upper
molars
in
lead
me
to
hesitate
in
considering
it
as
the
actual
ancestor
of
the
modern
if
has
a
fore
foot
though
i
am
inclined
to
suspect
that
it
resembles
it
will
be
a
better
representative
of
the
oldest
forms
of
the
traguline
series
but
occurs
in
the
middle
eocene
and
is
in
fact
the
oldest
known
artiodactyle
mammal
where
then
must
we
look
for
its
ancestor
if
we
follow
down
other
lines
of
recent
and
tertiary
the
same
question
presents
itself
the
pigs
are
traceable
back
through
the
miocene
epoch
to
the
upper
eocene
where
they
appear
in
the
two
forms
of
and
but
appears
to
have
had
only
two
toes
again
all
the
great
groups
of
the
ruminants
the
antilopidoe
and
are
represented
in
the
miocene
epoch
and
so
are
the
camels
the
upper
eocene
which
is
intercalary
between
the
pigs
and
the
has
only
two
or
at
most
three
toes
among
the
scanty
mammals
of
the
lower
eocene
formation
we
have
the
perissodactyle
represented
by
and
suppose
for
a
moment
for
the
sake
of
following
out
the
argument
that
represents
the
primary
stock
of
the
perissodactyles
and
that
of
the
artiodactyles
though
i
am
far
from
saying
that
such
is
the
case
then
we
find
in
the
earliest
fauna
of
the
eocene
epoch
to
which
our
investigations
carry
us
the
two
divisions
of
the
completely
differentiated
and
no
trace
of
any
common
stock
of
both
or
of
predecessors
to
either
with
the
case
of
the
horses
before
us
justifying
a
belief
in
the
production
of
new
animal
forms
by
modification
of
old
ones
i
see
no
escape
from
the
necessity
of
seeking
for
these
ancestors
of
the
beyond
the
limits
of
the
tertiary
formations
i
could
as
soon
admit
special
creation
at
once
as
suppose
that
the
perissodactyles
and
artiodactyles
had
no
ancestors
and
when
we
consider
how
large
a
portion
of
the
tertiary
period
elapsed
before
was
converted
into
it
is
difficult
to
escape
the
conclusion
that
a
large
proportion
of
time
anterior
to
the
tertiary
period
must
have
been
expended
in
converting
the
common
stock
of
the
into
perissodactyles
and
artiodactyles
the
same
moral
is
inculcated
by
the
study
of
every
other
order
of
tertiary
monodelphous
each
of
these
orders
is
represented
in
the
miocene
epoch
the
eocene
formation
as
i
have
already
said
contains
insectivora
rodentia
ungulata
and
but
the
are
extreme
modifications
of
the
just
as
the
are
extreme
modifications
of
the
carnivorous
type
and
therefore
it
is
to
my
mind
incredible
that
monodelphous
and
should
not
have
been
abundantly
developed
along
with
in
the
mesozoic
epoch
but
if
this
be
the
case
how
much
further
back
must
we
go
to
find
the
common
stock
of
the
monodelphous
as
to
the
if
we
may
trust
the
evidence
which
seems
to
be
afforded
by
their
very
scanty
remains
a
hypsiprymnoid
form
existed
at
the
epoch
of
the
trias
contemporaneously
with
a
carnivorous
form
at
the
epoch
of
the
trias
therefore
the
must
have
already
existed
long
enough
to
have
become
differentiated
into
carnivorous
and
herbivorous
forms
but
the
are
lower
forms
than
the
which
last
are
intercalary
between
the
and
the
to
what
point
of
the
palaeozoic
epoch
then
must
we
upon
any
rational
estimate
relegate
the
origin
of
the
the
investigation
of
the
occurrence
of
the
classes
and
of
the
orders
of
the
in
time
points
in
exactly
the
same
direction
if
as
there
is
great
reason
to
believe
true
birds
existed
in
the
triassic
epoch
the
ornithoscelidous
forms
by
which
reptiles
passed
into
birds
must
have
preceded
them
in
fact
there
is
even
at
present
considerable
ground
for
suspecting
the
existence
of
in
the
permian
formations
but
in
that
case
lizards
must
be
of
still
earlier
date
and
if
the
very
small
differences
which
are
observable
between
the
of
the
older
mesozoic
formations
and
those
of
the
present
day
furnish
any
sort
of
approximation
towards
an
estimate
of
the
average
rate
of
change
among
the
it
is
almost
appalling
to
reflect
how
far
back
in
palaeozoic
times
we
must
go
before
we
can
hope
to
arrive
at
that
common
stock
from
which
the
lacertilia
and
which
had
attained
so
great
a
development
in
the
triassic
epoch
must
have
been
derived
the
and
tell
the
same
story
there
is
not
a
single
class
of
vertebrated
animals
which
when
it
first
appears
is
represented
by
analogues
of
the
lowest
known
members
of
the
same
class
therefore
if
there
is
any
truth
in
the
doctrine
of
evolution
every
class
must
be
vastly
older
than
the
first
record
of
its
appearance
upon
the
surface
of
the
globe
but
if
considerations
of
this
kind
compel
us
to
place
the
origin
of
vertebrated
animals
at
a
period
sufficiently
distant
from
the
upper
silurian
in
which
the
first
elasmobranchs
and
ganoids
occur
to
allow
of
the
evolution
of
such
fishes
as
these
from
a
vertebrate
as
simple
as
the
i
can
only
repeat
that
it
is
appalling
to
speculate
upon
the
extent
to
which
that
origin
must
have
preceded
the
epoch
of
the
first
recorded
appearance
of
vertebrate
life
such
is
the
further
commentary
which
i
have
to
offer
upon
the
statement
of
the
chief
results
of
palaeontology
which
i
formerly
ventured
to
lay
before
you
but
the
growth
of
knowledge
in
the
interval
makes
me
conscious
of
an
omission
of
considerable
moment
in
that
statement
inasmuch
as
it
contains
no
reference
to
the
bearings
of
palaeontology
upon
the
theory
of
the
distribution
of
life
nor
takes
note
of
the
remarkable
manner
in
which
the
facts
of
distribution
in
present
and
past
times
accord
with
the
doctrine
of
evolution
especially
in
regard
to
land
animals
that
connection
between
palaeontology
and
geology
and
the
present
distribution
of
terrestrial
animals
which
so
strikingly
impressed
darwin
thirty
years
ago
as
to
lead
him
to
speak
of
a
law
of
succession
of
types
and
of
the
wonderful
relationship
on
the
same
continent
between
the
dead
and
the

has
recently
received
much
elucidation
from
the
researches

in

labours
of

has
been
instructively
discussed
in
the
thoughtful
and
ingenious
work

the
paper

the

probably
produced
by

well
worthy

the
most
careful
study

propose
to
lay
before
you
as
briefly
as
i
can
the
ideas
to
which
a
long
consideration
of
the
subject
has
given
rise
in
my
mind
if
the
doctrine
of
evolution
is
sound
one
of
its
immediate
consequences
clearly
is
that
the
present
distribution
of
life
upon
the
globe
is
the
product
of
two
factors
the
one
being
the
distribution
which
obtained
in
the
immediately
preceding
epoch
and
the
other
the
character
and
the
extent
of
the
changes
which
have
taken
place
in
physical
geography
between
the
one
epoch

the
other

to
put
the
matter
in
another
way
the
fauna
and
flora
of
any
given
area
in
any
given
epoch
can
consist
only
of
such
forms
of
life
as
are
directly
descended
from
those
which
constituted
the
fauna
and
flora
of
the
same
area
in
the
immediately
preceding
epoch
unless
the
physical
geography
under
which
i
include
climatal
conditions
of
the
area
has
been
so
altered
as
to
give
rise
to
immigration
of
living
forms
from
some
other
area
the
evolutionist
therefore
is
bound
to
grapple
with
the
following
problem
whenever
it
is
clearly
put
before
him
here
are
the
faunae
of
the
same
area
during
successive
epochs
show
good
cause
for
believing
either
that
these
faunae
have
been
derived
from
one
another
by
gradual
modification
or
that
the
faunae
have
reached
the
area
in
question
by
migration
from
some
area
in
which
they
have
undergone
their
development
i
propose
to
attempt
to
deal
with
this
problem
so
far
as
it
is
exemplified
by
the
distribution
of
the
terrestrial
and
i
shall
endeavour
to
show
you
that
it
is
capable
of
solution
in
a
sense
entirely
favourable
to
the
doctrine
of
evolution
i
have
elsewhere
stated
at
length
the
reasons
which
lead
me
to
recognise
four
primary
distributional
provinces
for
the
terrestrial
in
the
present
world
namely
first
the
or
province
secondly
the
province
including
australia
tasmania
and
the
negrito
islands
thirdly
or
south
america
north
america
as
far
as
mexico
and
fourthly
the
rest
of
the
world
or
in
which
province
america
north
of
mexico
constitutes
one
africa
south
of
the
sahara
a
second
hindostan
a
third
and
the
remainder
of
the
old
world
a
fourth
footnote
on
the
classification
and
distribution
of
the
alectoromorphoe
of
the
zoological
now
the
truth
which
darwin
perceived
and
promulgated
as
the
law
of
the
succession
of
types
is
that
in
all
these
provinces
the
animals
found
in
pliocene
or
later
deposits
are
closely
affined
to
those
which
now
inhabit
the
same
provinces
and
that
conversely
the
forms
characteristic
of
other
provinces
are
absent
north
and
south
america
perhaps
present
one
or
two
exceptions
to
the
last
rule
but
they
are
readily
susceptible
of
explanation
thus
in
australia
the
later
tertiary
mammals
are
marsupials
possibly
with
the
exception
of
the
dog
and
a
rodent
or
two
as
at
present
in
the
later
tertiary
fauna
exhibits
numerous
and
varied
forms
of
platyrrhine
apes
rodents
cats
dogs
stags
and
opossums
but
as
at
present
no
catarrhine
apes
no
lemurs
no
oxen
antelopes
rhinoceroses
nor
other
than
opossums
and
in
the
widespread
arctogaeal
province
the
pliocene
and
later
mammals
belong
to
the
same
groups
as
those
which
now
exist
in
the
province
the
law
of
succession
of
types
therefore
holds
good
for
the
present
epoch
as
compared
with
its
predecessor
does
it
equally
well
apply
to
the
pliocene
fauna
when
we
compare
it
with
that
of
the
miocene
epoch
by
great
good
fortune
an
extensive
mammalian
fauna
of
the
latter
epoch
has
now
become
known
in
four
very
distant
portions
of
the
arctogaeal
province
which
do
not
differ
greatly
in
latitude
thus
falconer
and
cautley
have
made
known
the
fauna
of
the
and
the
perim
islands
gaudry
that
of
attica
many
observers
that
of
central
europe
and
france
and
leidy
that
of
nebraska
on
the
eastern
flank
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
results
are
very
striking
the
total
miocene
fauna
comprises
many
genera
and
species
of
catarrhine
apes
of
bats
of
of
arctogaeal
types
of
of
of
equine
rhinocerotic
and
tapirine
quadrupeds
of
cameline
bovine
antilopine
cervine
and
traguline
ruminants
of
pigs
and
hippopotamuses
of
and
among
other
with
allied
to
the
aretogaeal
and
and
not
to
the
edentates
the
only
type
present
in
the
miocene
but
absent
in
the
existing
fauna
of
eastern
arctogaea
is
that
of
the
which
however
remains
in
north
america
but
it
is
very
remarkable
that
while
the
miocene
fauna
of
the
arctogaeal
province
as
a
whole
is
of
the
same
character
as
the
existing
fauna
of
the
same
province
as
a
whole
the
component
elements
of
the
fauna
were
differently
associated
in
the
miocene
epoch
north
america
possessed
elephants
horses
rhinoceroses
and
a
great
number
and
variety
of
ruminants
and
pigs
which
are
absent
in
the
present
indigenous
fauna
europe
had
its
apes
elephants
rhinoceroses
tapirs
giraffes
hyaenas
great
cats
edentates
and
marsupials
which
have
equally
vanished
from
its
present
fauna
and
in
northern
india
the
african
types
of
hippopotamuses
giraffes
and
elephants
were
mixed
up
with
what
are
now
the
asiatic
types
of
the
latter
and
with
camels
and
semnopithecine
and
pithecine
apes
of
no
less
distinctly
asiatic
forms
in
fact
the
miocene
mammalian
fauna
of
europe
and
the
himalayan
regions
contains
associated
together
the
types
which
are
at
present
separately
located
in
the
and
indian
of
arctogaea
now
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
on
other
grounds
that
both
hindostan
south
of
the
ganges
and
africa
south
of
the
sahara
were
separated
by
a
wide
sea
from
europe
and
north
asia
during
the
middle
and
upper
eocene
epochs
hence
it
becomes
highly
probable
that
the
similarities
and
no
less
remarkable
differences
between
the
present
faunae
of
india
and
south
africa
have
arisen
in
some
such
fashion
as
the
following
some
time
during
the
miocene
epoch
possibly
when
the
himalayan
chain
was
elevated
the
bottom
of
the
nummulitic
sea
was
upheaved
and
converted
into
dry
land
in
the
direction
of
a
line
extending
from
abyssinia
to
the
mouth
of
the
ganges
by
this
means
the
dekhan
on
the
one
hand
and
south
africa
on
the
other
became
connected
with
the
miocene
dry
land
and
with
one
another
the
miocene
mammals
spread
gradually
over
this
intermediate
dry
land
and
if
the
condition
of
its
eastern
and
western
ends
offered
as
wide
contrasts
as
the
valleys
of
the
ganges
and
arabia
do
now
many
forms
which
made
their
way
into
africa
must
have
been
different
from
those
which
reached
the
dekhan
while
others
might
pass
into
both
these
that
there
was
a
continuity
of
dry
land
between
europe
and
north
america
during
the
miocene
epoch
appears
to
me
to
be
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
fact
that
many
genera
of
terrestrial
mammals
such
as
hystrix
elephas
mastodon
equus
hipparion
anchitherium
rhinoceros
cervus
amphicyon
and
are
common
to
the
miocene
formations
of
the
two
areas
and
have
as
yet
been
found
except
perhaps
in
no
deposit
of
earlier
age
whether
this
connection
took
place
by
the
east
or
by
the
west
or
by
both
sides
of
the
old
world
there
is
at
present
no
certain
evidence
and
the
question
is
immaterial
to
the
present
argument
but
as
there
are
good
grounds
for
the
belief
that
the
australian
province
and
the
indian
and
were
separated
by
sea
from
the
rest
of
arctogaea
before
the
miocene
epoch
so
it
has
been
rendered
no
less
probable
by
the
investigations
of
carrick
moore
and
professor
duncan
that
columbia
was
separated
by
sea
from
north
america
during
a
large
part
of
the
miocene
epoch
it
is
unfortunate
that
we
have
no
knowledge
of
the
miocene
mammalian
fauna
of
the
australian
and
provinces
but
seeing
that
not
a
trace
of
a
platyrrhine
ape
of
a
procyonine
carnivore
of
a
characteristically
rodent
of
a
sloth
an
armadillo
or
an
has
yet
been
found
in
miocene
deposits
of
arctogaea
i
can
not
doubt
that
they
already
existed
in
the
miocene
province
nor
is
it
less
probable
that
the
characteristic
types
of
australian
mammalia
were
already
developed
in
that
region
in
miocene
times
but
presents
difficulties
from
which
australia
is
free
and
are
now
indigenous
in
south
america
as
they
are
in
arctogaea
and
among
the
pliocene
mammals
the
arctogaeal
genera
mastodon
and
are
numbered
are
these
postmiocene
immigrants
or
praemiocene
natives
still
more
perplexing
are
the
strange
and
interesting
forms
macrauchenia
and
a
new
anoplotherioid
mammal
which
cunningham
sent
over
to
me
some
time
ago
from
patagonia
i
confess
i
am
strongly
inclined
to
surmise
that
these
last
at
any
rate
are
remnants
of
the
population
of
before
the
miocene
epoch
and
were
not
derived
from
arctogaea
by
way
of
the
north
and
east
the
fact
that
this
immense
fauna
of
miocene
arctogaea
is
now
fully
and
richly
represented
only
in
india
and
in
south
africa
while
it
is
shrunk
and
depauperised
in
north
asia
europe
and
north
america
becomes
at
once
intelligible
if
we
suppose
that
india
and
south
africa
had
but
a
scanty
mammalian
population
before
the
miocene
immigration
while
the
conditions
were
highly
favourable
to
the
new
comers
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
these
new
regions
offered
themselves
to
the
miocene
ungulates
as
south
america
and
australia
offered
themselves
to
the
cattle
sheep
and
horses
of
modern
colonists
but
after
these
great
areas
were
thus
peopled
came
the
glacial
epoch
during
which
the
excessive
cold
to
say
nothing
of
depression
and
must
have
almost
depopulated
all
the
northern
parts
of
arctogaea
destroying
all
the
higher
mammalian
forms
except
those
which
like
the
elephant
and
rhinoceros
could
adjust
their
coats
to
the
altered
conditions
even
these
must
have
been
driven
away
from
the
greater
part
of
the
area
only
those
miocene
mammals
which
had
passed
into
hindostan
and
into
south
africa
would
escape
decimation
by
such
changes
in
the
physical
geography
of
arctogaea
and
when
the
northern
hemisphere
passed
into
its
present
condition
these
lost
tribes
of
the
miocene
fauna
were
hemmed
by
the
himalayas
the
sahara
the
red
sea
and
the
arabian
deserts
within
their
present
boundaries
now
on
the
hypothesis
of
evolution
there
is
no
sort
of
difficulty
in
admitting
that
the
differences
between
the
miocene
forms
of
the
mammalian
fauna
and
those
which
exist
at
present
are
the
results
of
gradual
modification
and
since
such
differences
in
distribution
as
obtain
are
readily
explained
by
the
changes
which
have
taken
place
in
the
physical
geography
of
the
world
since
the
miocene
epoch
it
is
clear
that
the
result
of
the
comparison
of
the
miocene
and
present
faunae
is
distinctly
in
favour
of
evolution
indeed
i
may
go
further
i
may
say
that
the
hypothesis
of
evolution
explains
the
facts
of
miocene
pliocene
and
recent
distribution
and
that
no
other
supposition
even
pretends
to
account
for
them
it
is
indeed
a
conceivable
supposition
that
every
species
of
rhinoceros
and
every
species
of
hyaena
in
the
long
succession
of
forms
between
the
miocene
and
the
present
species
was
separately
constructed
out
of
dust
or
out
of
nothing
by
supernatural
power
but
until
i
receive
distinct
evidence
of
the
fact
i
refuse
to
run
the
risk
of
insulting
any
sane
man
by
supposing
that
he
seriously
holds
such
a
notion
let
us
now
take
a
step
further
back
in
time
and
inquire
into
the
relations
between
the
miocene
fauna
and
its
predecessor
of
the
upper
eocene
formation
here
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
our
materials
for
forming
a
judgment
are
nothing
to
be
compared
in
point
of
extent
or
variety
with
those
which
are
yielded
by
the
miocene
strata
however
what
we
do
know
of
this
upper
eocene
fauna
of
europe
gives
sufficient
positive
information
to
enable
us
to
draw
some
tolerably
safe
inferences
it
has
yielded
representatives
of
of
of
of
of
artiodactyle
and
perissodactyle
and
of
marsupials
no
australian
type
of
marsupial
has
been
discovered
in
the
upper
eocene
strata
nor
any
edentate
mammal
the
genera
except
perhaps
in
the
case
of
some
of
the
and
are
different
from
those
of
the
miocene
epoch
but
present
a
remarkable
general
similarity
to
the
miocene
and
recent
genera
in
several
cases
as
i
have
already
shown
it
has
now
been
clearly
made
out
that
the
relation
between
the
eocene
and
miocene
forms
is
such
that
the
eocene
form
is
the
less
specialised
while
its
miocene
ally
is
more
so
and
the
specialisation
reaches
its
maximum
in
the
recent
forms
of
the
same
type
so
far
as
the
upper
eocene
and
the
miocene
mammalian
faunae
are
comparable
their
relations
are
such
as
in
no
way
to
oppose
the
hypothesis
that
the
older
are
the
progenitors
of
the
more
recent
forms
while
in
some
cases
they
distinctly
favour
that
hypothesis
the
period
in
tine
and
the
changes
in
physical
geography
represented
by
the
nummulitic
deposits
are
undoubtedly
very
great
while
the
remains
of
middle
eocene
and
older
eocene
mammals
are
comparatively
few
the
general
facies
of
the
middle
eocene
fauna
however
is
quite
that
of
the
upper
the
older
eocene
mammalian
fauna
contains
bats
two
genera
of
three
genera
of
probably
all
perissodactyle
and
a
didelphid
marsupial
all
these
forms
except
perhaps
the
bat
and
the
opossum
belong
to
genera
which
are
not
known
to
occur
out
of
the
lower
eocene
formation
the
appears
to
have
been
allied
to
the
miocene
and
later
tapirs
while
in
its
skull
and
dentition
curiously
partakes
of
both
artiodactyle
and
perissodactyle
characters
the
third
trochanter
upon
its
femur
and
its
hind
foot
however
appear
definitely
to
fix
its
position
in
the
latter
division
there
is
nothing
then
in
what
is
known
of
the
older
eocene
mammals
of
the
arctogaeal
province
to
forbid
the
supposition
that
they
stood
in
an
ancestral
relation
to
those
of
the
calcaire
grossier
and
the
gypsum
of
the
paris
basin
and
that
our
present
fauna
therefore
is
directly
derived
from
that
which
already
existed
in
arctogaea
at
the
commencement
of
the
tertiary
period
but
if
we
now
cross
the
frontier
between
the
cainozoic
and
the
mesozoic
faunae
as
they
are
preserved
within
the
arctogaeal
area
we
meet
with
an
astounding
change
and
what
appears
to
be
a
complete
and
unmistakable
break
in
the
line
of
biological
continuity
among
the
twelve
or
fourteen
species
of
which
are
said
to
have
been
found
in
the
purbecks
not
one
is
a
member
of
the
orders
rodentia
or
which
are
so
well
represented
in
the
tertiaries
no
are
certainly
known
nor
any
marsupials
thus
there
is
a
vast
negative
difference
between
the
cainozoic
and
the
mesozoic
mammalian
faunae
of
europe
but
there
is
a
still
more
important
positive
difference
inasmuch
as
all
these
mammalia
appear
to
be
marsupials
belonging
to
australian
groups
and
thus
appertaining
to
a
different
distributional
province
from
the
eocene
and
miocene
marsupials
which
are
so
far
as
the
imperfect
materials
which
exist
enable
a
judgment
to
be
formed
the
same
law
appears
to
have
held
good
for
all
the
earlier
mesozoic
of
the
stonesfield
slate
mammals
one
has
a
definitely
australian
character
one
may
be
either
dasyurid
or
didelphine
of
a
third
nothing
can
at
present
be
said
the
two
mammals
of
the
trias
also
appear
to
belong
to
australian
groups
every
one
is
aware
of
the
many
curious
points
of
resemblance
between
the
marine
fauna
of
the
european
mesozoic
rocks
and
that
which
now
exists
in
australia
but
if
there
was
this
australian
facies
about
both
the
terrestrial
and
the
marine
faunae
of
mesozoic
europe
and
if
there
is
this
unaccountable
and
immense
break
between
the
fauna
of
mesozoic
and
that
of
tertiary
europe
is
it
not
a
very
obvious
suggestion
that
in
the
mesozoic
epoch
the
australian
province
included
europe
and
that
the
arctogaeal
province
was
contained
within
other
limits
the
arctogaeal
province
is
at
present
enormous
while
the
australian
is
relatively
small
why
should
not
these
proportions
have
been
different
during
the
mesozoic
epoch
thus
i
am
led
to
think
that
by
far
the
simplest
and
most
rational
mode
of
accounting
for
the
great
change
which
took
place
in
the
living
inhabitants
of
the
european
area
at
the
end
of
the
mesozoic
epoch
is
the
supposition
that
it
arose
from
a
vast
alteration
of
the
physical
geography
of
the
globe
whereby
an
area
long
tenanted
by
cainozoic
forms
was
brought
into
such
relations
with
the
european
area
that
migration
from
the
one
to
the
other
became
possible
and
took
place
on
a
great
scale
this
supposition
relieves
us
at
once
from
the
difficulty
in
which
we
were
left
some
time
ago
by
the
arguments
which
i
used
to
demonstrate
the
necessity
of
the
existence
of
all
the
great
types
of
the
eocene
epoch
in
some
antecedent
period
it
is
this
mesozoic
continent
which
may
well
have
lain
in
the
neighbourhood
of
what
are
now
the
shores
of
the
north
pacific
ocean
which
i
suppose
to
have
been
occupied
by
the
mesozoic
and
it
is
in
this
region
that
i
conceive
they
must
have
gone
through
the
long
series
of
changes
by
which
they
were
specialised
into
the
forms
which
we
refer
to
different
orders
i
think
it
very
probable
that
what
is
now
south
america
may
have
received
the
characteristic
elements
of
its
mammalian
fauna
during
the
mesozoic
epoch
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
general
nature
of
the
change
which
took
place
at
the
end
of
the
mesozoic
epoch
in
europe
was
the
upheaval
of
the
eastern
and
northern
regions
of
the
mesozoic
into
a
westward
extension
of
the
mesozoic
continent
over
which
the
mammalian
fauna
by
which
it
was
already
peopled
gradually
spread
this
invasion
of
the
land
was
prefaced
by
a
previous
invasion
of
the
cretaceous
sea
by
modern
forms
of
mollusca
and
fish
it
is
easy
to
imagine
how
an
analogous
change
might
come
about
in
the
existing
world
there
is
at
present
a
great
difference
between
the
fauna
of
the
polynesian
islands
and
that
of
the
west
coast
of
america
the
animals
which
are
leaving
their
spoils
in
the
deposits
now
forming
in
these
localities
are
widely
different
hence
if
a
gradual
shifting
of
the
deep
sea
which
at
present
bars
migration
between
the
easternmost
of
these
islands
and
america
took
place
to
the
westward
while
the
american
side
of
the
was
gradually
upheaved
the
palaeontologist
of
the
future
would
find
over
the
pacific
area
exactly
such
a
change
as
i
am
supposing
to
have
occurred
in
the
area
at
the
close
of
the
mesozoic
period
an
australian
fauna
would
be
found
underlying
an
american
fauna
and
the
transition
from
the
one
to
the
other
would
be
as
abrupt
as
that
between
the
chalk
and
lower
tertiaries
and
as
the
of
the
newly
formed
extension
of
the
american
continent
gave
rise
to
rivers
and
lakes
the
mammals
mired
in
their
mud
would
differ
from
those
of
like
deposits
on
the
australian
side
just
as
the
eocene
mammals
differ
from
those
of
the
purbecks
how
do
similar
reasonings
apply
to
the
other
great
change
of
life
that
which
took
place
at
the
end
of
the
palaeozoic
period
in
the
triassic
epoch
the
distribution
of
the
dry
land
and
of
terrestrial
vertebrate
life
appears
to
have
been
generally
similar
to
that
which
existed
in
the
mesozoic
epoch
so
that
the
triassic
continents
and
their
faunae
seem
to
be
related
to
the
mesozoic
lands
and
their
faunae
just
as
those
of
the
miocene
epoch
are
related
to
those
of
the
present
day
in
fact
as
i
have
recently
endeavoured
to
prove
to
the
society
there
was
an
arctogaeal
continent
and
an
arctogaeal
province
of
distribution
in
triassic
times
as
there
is
now
and
the
and
which
constituted
that
fauna
were
i
doubt
not
the
progenitors
of
the
and
of
the
whole
mesozoic
epoch
looking
at
the
present
terrestrial
fauna
of
australia
it
appears
to
me
to
be
very
probable
that
it
is
essentially
a
remnant
of
the
fauna
of
the
triassic
or
even
of
an
earlier
age
in
which
case
australia
must
at
that
time
have
been
in
continuity
with
the
arctogaeal
continent
footnote
since
this
address
was
read
krefft
has
sent
us
news
of
the
discovery
in
australia
of
a
freshwater
fish
of
strangely
palaeozoic
aspect
and
apparently
a
ganoid
intermediate
between
and
the
now
but
now
comes
the
further
inquiry
where
was
the
highly
differentiated
sauropsidan
fauna
of
the
trias
in
palaeozoic
times
the
supposition
that
the
dinosaurian
crocodilian
dicynodontian
and
to
plesiosaurian
types
were
suddenly
created
at
the
end
of
the
permian
epoch
may
be
dismissed
without
further
consideration
as
a
monstrous
and
unwarranted
assumption
the
supposition
that
all
these
types
were
rapidly
differentiated
out
of
in
the
time
represented
by
the
passage
from
the
palaeozoic
to
the
mesozoic
formation
appears
to
me
to
be
hardly
more
credible
to
say
nothing
of
the
indications
of
the
existence
of
dinosaurian
forms
in
the
permian
rocks
which
have
already
been
obtained
for
my
part
i
entertain
no
sort
of
doubt
that
the
reptiles
birds
and
mammals
of
the
trias
are
the
direct
descendants
of
reptiles
birds
and
mammals
which
existed
in
the
latter
part
of
the
palaeozoic
epoch
but
not
in
any
area
of
the
present
dry
land
which
has
yet
been
explored
by
the
geologist
this
may
seem
a
bold
assumption
but
it
will
not
appear
unwarrantable
to
those
who
reflect
upon
the
very
small
extent
of
the
earth
surface
which
has
hitherto
exhibited
the
remains
of
the
great
mammalian
fauna
of
the
eocene
times
in
this
respect
the
permian
land
vertebrate
fauna
appears
to
me
to
be
related
to
the
triassic
much
as
the
eocene
is
to
the
miocene
terrestrial
reptiles
have
been
found
in
permian
rocks
only
in
three
localities
in
some
spots
of
france
and
recently
of
england
and
over
a
more
extensive
area
in
germany
who
can
suppose
that
the
few
fossils
yet
found
in
these
regions
give
any
sufficient
representation
of
the
permian
fauna
it
may
be
said
that
the
carboniferous
formations
demonstrate
the
existence
of
a
vast
extent
of
dry
land
in
the
present
area
and
that
the
supposed
terrestrial
palaeozoic
vertebrate
fauna
ought
to
have
left
its
remains
in
the
especially
as
there
is
now
reason
to
believe
that
much
of
the
coal
was
formed
by
the
accumulation
of
spores
and
sporangia
on
dry
land
but
if
we
consider
the
matter
more
closely
i
think
that
this
apparent
objection
loses
its
force
it
is
clear
that
during
the
carboniferous
epoch
the
vast
area
of
land
which
is
now
covered
by
must
have
been
undergoing
a
gradual
depression
the
dry
land
thus
depressed
must
therefore
have
existed
as
such
before
the
carboniferous
epoch
in
other
words
in
devonian
times
and
its
terrestrial
population
may
never
have
been
other
than
such
as
existed
during
the
devonian
or
some
previous
epoch
although
much
higher
forms
may
have
been
developed
elsewhere
again
let
me
say
that
i
am
making
no
gratuitous
assumption
of
inconceivable
changes
it
is
clear
that
the
enormous
area
of
polynesia
is
on
the
whole
an
area
over
which
depression
has
taken
place
to
an
immense
extent
consequently
a
great
continent
or
assemblage
of
subcontinental
masses
of
land
must
have
existed
at
some
former
time
and
that
at
a
recent
period
geologically
speaking
in
the
area
of
the
pacific
but
if
that
continent
had
contained
mammals
some
of
them
must
have
remained
to
tell
the
tale
and
as
it
is
well
known
that
these
islands
have
no
indigenous
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
none
existed
thus
midway
between
australia
and
south
america
each
of
which
possesses
an
abundant
and
diversified
mammalian
fauna
a
mass
of
land
which
may
have
been
as
large
as
both
put
together
must
have
existed
without
a
mammalian
inhabitant
suppose
that
the
shores
of
this
great
land
were
fringed
as
those
of
tropical
australia
are
now
with
belts
of
mangroves
which
would
extend
landwards
on
the
one
side
and
be
buried
beneath
littoral
deposits
on
the
other
side
as
depression
went
on
and
great
beds
of
mangrove
lignite
might
accumulate
over
the
sinking
land
let
upheaval
of
the
whole
now
take
place
in
such
a
manner
as
to
bring
the
emerging
land
into
continuity
with
the
or
australian
continent
and
in
course
of
time
it
would
be
peopled
by
an
extension
of
the
fauna
of
one
of
these
two
regions
just
as
i
imagine
the
european
permian
dry
land
to
have
been
peopled
i
see
nothing
whatever
against
the
supposition
that
distributional
provinces
of
terrestrial
life
existed
in
the
devonian
epoch
inasmuch
as
barrande
has
proved
that
they
existed
much
earlier
i
am
aware
of
no
reason
for
doubting
that
as
regards
the
grades
of
terrestrial
life
contained
in
them
one
of
these
may
have
been
related
to
another
as
new
zealand
is
to
australia
or
as
australia
is
to
india
at
the
present
day
analogy
seems
to
me
to
be
rather
in
favour
of
than
against
the
supposition
that
while
only
ganoid
fishes
inhabited
the
fresh
waters
of
our
devonian
land
and
or
even
higher
forms
may
have
existed
though
we
have
not
yet
found
them
the
earliest
carboniferous
now
known
such
as
are
so
highly
specialised
that
i
can
by
no
means
conceive
that
they
have
been
developed
out
of
piscine
forms
in
the
interval
between
the
devonian
and
the
carboniferous
periods
considerable
as
that
is
and
i
take
refuge
in
one
of
two
alternatives
either
they
existed
in
our
own
area
during
the
devonian
epoch
and
we
have
simply
not
yet
found
them
or
they
formed
part
of
the
population
of
some
other
distributional
province
of
that
day
and
only
entered
our
area
by
migration
at
the
end
of
the
devonian
epoch
whether
and
existed
along
with
them
is
to
me
at
present
a
perfectly
open
question
which
is
just
as
likely
to
receive
an
affirmative
as
a
negative
answer
from
future
inquirers
let
me
now
gather
together
the
threads
of
my
argumentation
into
the
form
of
a
connected
hypothetical
view
of
the
manner
in
which
the
distribution
of
living
and
extinct
animals
has
been
brought
about
i
conceive
that
distinct
provinces
of
the
distribution
of
terrestrial
life
have
existed
since
the
earliest
period
at
which
that
life
is
recorded
and
possibly
much
earlier
and
i
suppose
with
darwin
that
the
progress
of
modification
of
terrestrial
forms
is
more
rapid
in
areas
of
elevation
than
in
areas
of
depression
i
take
it
to
be
certain
that
labyrinthodont
existed
in
the
distributional
province
which
included
the
dry
land
depressed
during
the
carboniferous
epoch
and
i
conceive
that
in
some
other
distributional
provinces
of
that
day
which
remained
in
the
condition
of
stationary
or
of
increasing
dry
land
the
various
types
of
the
terrestrial
and
of
the
were
gradually
developing
the
permian
epoch
marks
the
commencement
of
a
new
movement
of
upheaval
in
our
area
which
dry
land
existed
in
north
america
europe
asia
and
africa
as
it
does
now
into
this
great
new
continental
area
the
mammals
birds
and
reptiles
developed
during
the
palaeozoic
epoch
spread
and
formed
the
great
triassic
arctogaeal
province
but
at
the
end
of
the
triassic
period
the
movement
of
depression
recommenced
in
our
area
though
it
was
doubtless
balanced
by
elevation
elsewhere
modification
and
development
checked
in
the
one
province
went
on
in
that
elsewhere
and
the
chief
forms
of
mammals
birds
and
reptiles
as
we
know
them
were
evolved
and
peopled
the
mesozoic
continent
i
conceive
australia
to
have
become
separated
from
the
continent
as
early
as
the
end
of
the
triassic
epoch
or
not
much
later
the
mesozoic
continent
must
i
conceive
have
lain
to
the
east
about
the
shores
of
the
north
pacific
and
indian
oceans
and
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
it
continued
along
the
eastern
side
of
the
pacific
area
to
what
is
now
the
province
of
the
characteristic
fauna
of
which
is
probably
a
remnant
of
the
population
of
the
latter
part
of
this
period
towards
the
latter
part
of
the
mesozoic
period
the
movement
of
upheaval
around
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
once
more
recommenced
and
was
very
probably
accompanied
by
a
depression
around
those
of
the
pacific
the
vertebrate
fauna
elaborated
in
the
mesozoic
continent
moved
westward
and
took
possession
of
the
new
lands
which
gradually
increased
in
extent
up
to
and
in
some
directions
after
the
miocene
epoch
it
is
in
favour
of
this
hypothesis
i
think
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
persistence
of
a
general
uniformity
in
the
positions
of
the
great
masses
of
land
and
water
from
the
devonian
period
or
earlier
to
the
present
day
the
four
great
oceans
atlantic
pacific
arctic
and
antarctic
may
have
occupied
their
present
positions
and
only
their
coasts
and
channels
of
communication
have
undergone
an
incessant
alteration
and
finally
the
hypothesis
i
have
put
before
you
requires
no
supposition
that
the
rate
of
change
in
organic
life
has
been
either
greater
or
less
in
ancient
times
than
it
is
now
nor
any
assumption
either
physical
or
biological
which
has
not
its
justification
in
analogous
phenomena
of
existing
nature
i
have
now
only
to
discharge
the
last
duty
of
my
office
which
is
to
thank
you
not
only
for
the
patient
attention
with
which
you
have
listened
to
me
so
long
but
also
for
the
uniform
kindness
with
which
for
the
past
two
years
you
have
rendered
my
endeavours
to
perform
the
important
and
often
laborious
functions
of
your
president
a
pleasure
instead
of
a
burden
