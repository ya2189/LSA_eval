preface
the
following
course
is
intended
to
give
in
as
simple
a
way
as
possible
the
essentials
of
synthetic
projective
geometry
while
in
the
main
the
theory
is
developed
along
the
track
laid
out
by
the
great
masters
of
the
subject
it
is
believed
that
there
has
been
a
slight
smoothing
of
the
road
in
some
places
especially
will
this
be
observed
in
the
chapter
on
involution
the
author
has
never
felt
satisfied
with
the
usual
treatment
of
that
subject
by
means
of
circles
and
anharmonic
ratios
a
purely
projective
notion
ought
not
to
be
based
on
metrical
foundations
metrical
developments
should
be
made
there
as
elsewhere
in
the
theory
by
the
introduction
of
infinitely
distant
elements
the
author
has
departed
from
the
custom
of
writing
in
parallel
columns
each
theorem
and
its
dual
he
has
not
found
that
it
conduces
to
sharpness
of
vision
to
try
to
focus
his
eyes
on
two
things
at
once
those
who
prefer
the
usual
method
of
procedure
can
of
course
develop
the
two
sets
of
theorems
side
by
side
the
author
has
not
found
this
the
better
plan
in
actual
teaching
as
regards
nomenclature
the
author
has
followed
the
lead
of
the
earlier
writers
in
english
and
has
called
the
system
of
lines
in
a
plane
which
all
pass
through
a
point
a
of
instead
of
a
of
as
later
writers
seem
inclined
to
do
for
a
point
considered
as
made
up
of
all
the
lines
and
planes
through
it
he
has
ventured
to
use
the
term
as
being
the
natural
dualization
of
the
usual
term
he
has
also
rejected
the
term
of
an
and
has
not
used
the
customary
terms
for
classifying
and
he
has
found
that
all
these
terms
are
very
confusing
to
the
student
who
inevitably
tries
to
connect
them
in
some
way
with
the
conic
sections
enough
examples
have
been
provided
to
give
the
student
a
clear
grasp
of
the
theory
many
are
of
sufficient
generality
to
serve
as
a
basis
for
individual
investigation
on
the
part
of
the
student
thus
the
third
example
at
the
end
of
the
first
chapter
will
be
found
to
be
very
fruitful
in
interesting
results
a
correspondence
is
there
indicated
between
lines
in
space
and
circles
through
a
fixed
point
in
space
if
the
student
will
trace
a
few
of
the
consequences
of
that
correspondence
and
determine
what
configurations
of
circles
correspond
to
intersecting
lines
to
lines
in
a
plane
to
lines
of
a
plane
pencil
to
lines
cutting
three
skew
lines
he
will
have
acquired
no
little
practice
in
picturing
to
himself
figures
in
space
the
writer
has
not
followed
the
usual
practice
of
inserting
historical
notes
at
the
foot
of
the
page
and
has
tried
instead
in
the
last
chapter
to
give
a
consecutive
account
of
the
history
of
pure
geometry
or
at
least
of
as
much
of
it
as
the
student
will
be
able
to
appreciate
who
has
mastered
the
course
as
given
in
the
preceding
chapters
one
is
not
apt
to
get
a
very
wide
view
of
the
history
of
a
subject
by
reading
a
hundred
biographical
footnotes
arranged
in
no
sort
of
sequence
the
writer
moreover
feels
that
the
proper
time
to
learn
the
history
of
a
subject
is
after
the
student
has
some
general
ideas
of
the
subject
itself
the
course
is
not
intended
to
furnish
an
illustration
of
how
a
subject
may
be
developed
from
the
smallest
possible
number
of
fundamental
assumptions
the
author
is
aware
of
the
importance
of
work
of
this
sort
but
he
does
not
believe
it
is
possible
at
the
present
time
to
write
a
book
along
such
lines
which
shall
be
of
much
use
for
elementary
students
for
the
purposes
of
this
course
the
student
should
have
a
thorough
grounding
in
ordinary
elementary
geometry
so
far
as
to
include
the
study
of
the
circle
and
of
similar
triangles
no
solid
geometry
is
needed
beyond
the
little
used
in
the
proof
of
theorem
and
except
in
certain
metrical
developments
of
the
general
theory
there
will
be
no
call
for
a
knowledge
of
trigonometry
or
analytical
geometry
naturally
the
student
who
is
equipped
with
these
subjects
as
well
as
with
the
calculus
will
be
a
little
more
mature
and
may
be
expected
to
follow
the
course
all
the
more
easily
the
author
has
had
no
difficulty
however
in
presenting
it
to
students
in
the
freshman
class
at
the
university
of
california
the
subject
of
synthetic
projective
geometry
is
in
the
opinion
of
the
writer
destined
shortly
to
force
its
way
down
into
the
secondary
schools
and
if
this
little
book
helps
to
accelerate
the
movement
he
will
feel
amply
repaid
for
the
task
of
working
the
materials
into
a
form
available
for
such
schools
as
well
as
for
the
lower
classes
in
the
university
the
material
for
the
course
has
been
drawn
from
many
sources
the
author
is
chiefly
indebted
to
the
classical
works
of
reye
cremona
steiner
poncelet
and
von
staudt
acknowledgments
and
thanks
are
also
due
to
professor
walter
eells
of
the
naval
academy
at
annapolis
for
his
searching
examination
and
keen
criticism
of
the
manuscript
also
to
professor
herbert
ellsworth
slaught
of
the
university
of
chicago
for
his
many
valuable
suggestions
and
to
professor
woods

who
have
tried
out

i
correspondence
definition
of
correspondence
given
any
two
sets
of
individuals
if
it
is
possible
to
set
up
such
a
correspondence
between
the
two
sets
that
to
any
individual
in
one
set
corresponds
one
and
only
one
individual
in
the
other
then
the
two
sets
are
said
to
be
in
with
each
other
this
notion
simple
as
it
is
is
of
fundamental
importance
in
all
branches
of
science
the
process
of
counting
is
nothing
but
a
setting
up
of
a
correspondence
between
the
objects
to
be
counted
and
certain
words
in
the
mind
many
savage
peoples
have
discovered
no
better
method
of
counting
than
by
setting
up
a
correspondence
between
the
objects
to
be
counted
and
their
fingers
the
scientist
who
busies
himself
with
naming
and
classifying
the
objects
of
nature
is
only
setting
up
a
correspondence
between
the
objects
and
certain
words
which
serve
not
as
a
means
of
counting
the
objects
but
of
listing
them
in
a
convenient
way
thus
he
may
be
able
to
marshal
and
array
his
material
in
such
a
way
as
to
bring
to
light
relations
that
may
exist
between
the
objects
themselves
indeed
the
whole
notion
of
language
springs
from
this
idea
of
correspondence
consequences
of
correspondence
the
most
useful
and
interesting
problem
that
may
arise
in
connection
with
any
correspondence
is
to
determine
just
what
relations
existing
between
the
individuals
of
one
assemblage
may
be
carried
over
to
another
assemblage
in
correspondence
with
it
it
is
a
favorite
error
to
assume
that
whatever
holds
for
one
set
must
also
hold
for
the
other
magicians
are
apt
to
assign
magic
properties
to
many
of
the
words
and
symbols
which
they
are
in
the
habit
of
using
and
scientists
are
constantly
confusing
objective
things
with
the
subjective
formulas
for
them
after
the
physicist
has
set
up
correspondences
between
physical
facts
and
mathematical
formulas
the
interpretation
of
these
formulas
is
his
most
important
and
difficult
task
in
mathematics
effort
is
constantly
being
made
to
set
up
correspondences
between
simple
notions
and
more
complicated
ones
or
between
the
fields
of
research
and
fields
less
known
thus
by
means
of
the
mechanism
employed
in
analytic
geometry
algebraic
theorems
are
made
to
yield
geometric
ones
and
vice
versa
in
geometry
we
get
at
the
properties
of
the
conic
sections
by
means
of
the
properties
of
the
straight
line
and
cubic
surfaces
are
studied
by
means
of
the
plane
figure
fig
figure
fig
correspondence
and
enumeration
if
a
correspondence
has
been
set
up
between
the
objects
of
one
set
and
the
objects
of
another
set
then
the
inference
may
usually
be
drawn
that
they
have
the
same
number
of
elements
if
however
there
is
an
infinite
number
of
individuals
in
each
of
the
two
sets
the
notion
of
counting
is
necessarily
ruled
out
it
may
be
possible
nevertheless
to
set
up
a
correspondence
between
the
elements
of
two
sets
even
when
the
number
is
infinite
thus
it
is
easy
to
set
up
such
a
correspondence
between
the
points
of
a
line
an
inch
long
and
the
points
of
a
line
two
inches
long
for
let
the
lines
fig
be
and
join
and
and
let
these
joining
lines
meet
in
for
every
point
on
a
point
may
be
found
on
by
joining
to
and
noting
the
point
where
meets
similarly
a
point
may
be
found
on
for
any
point
on
the
correspondence
is
clearly
but
it
would
be
absurd
to
infer
from
this
that
there
were
just
as
many
points
on
as
on
in
fact
it
would
be
just
as
reasonable
to
infer
that
there
were
twice
as
many
points
on
as
on
for
if
we
bend
into
a
circle
with
center
at
fig
we
see
that
for
every
point
on
there
are
two
points
on
thus
it
is
seen
that
the
notion
of
correspondence
is
more
extensive
than
the
notion
of
counting
and
includes
the
notion
of
counting
only
when
applied
to
finite
assemblages
correspondence
between
a
part
and
the
whole
of
an
infinite
assemblage
in
the
discussion
of
the
last
paragraph
the
remarkable
fact
was
brought
to
light
that
it
is
sometimes
possible
to
set
the
elements
of
an
assemblage
into
correspondence
with
a
part
of
those
elements
a
reflection
will
convince
one
that
this
is
never
possible
when
there
is
a
finite
number
of
elements
in
the
we
may
take
this
property
as
our
definition
of
an
infinite
assemblage
and
say
that
an
infinite
assemblage
is
one
that
may
be
put
into
correspondence
with
part
of
itself
this
has
the
advantage
of
being
a
positive
definition
as
opposed
to
the
usual
negative
definition
of
an
infinite
assemblage
as
one
that
can
not
be
counted
infinitely
distant
point
we
have
illustrated
above
a
simple
method
of
setting
the
points
of
two
lines
into
correspondence
the
same
illustration
will
serve
also
to
show
how
it
is
possible
to
set
the
points
on
a
line
into
correspondence
with
the
lines
through
a
point
thus
for
any
point
on
the
line
there
is
a
line
through
we
must
assume
the
line
extended
indefinitely
in
both
directions
however
if
we
are
to
have
a
point
on
it
for
every
line
through
and
even
with
this
extension
there
is
one
line
through
according
to
postulate
which
does
not
meet
the
line
and
which
therefore
has
no
point
on
to
correspond
to
it
in
order
to
smooth
out
this
discrepancy
we
are
accustomed
to
assume
the
existence
of
an
point
on
the
line
and
to
assign
this
point
as
the
corresponding
point
of
the
exceptional
line
of
with
this
understanding
then
we
may
say
that
we
have
set
the
lines
through
a
point
and
the
points
on
a
line
into
correspondence
this
correspondence
is
of
such
fundamental
importance
in
the
study
of
projective
geometry
that
a
special
name
is
given
to
it
calling
the
totality
of
points
on
a
line
a
and
the
totality
of
lines
through
a
point
a
of
we
say
that
the
and
the
pencil
related
as
above
are
in
or
that
they
are
axial
pencil
fundamental
forms
a
similar
correspondence
may
be
set
up
between
the
points
on
a
line
and
the
planes
through
another
line
which
does
not
meet
the
first
such
a
system
of
planes
is
called
an
and
the
three
the
pencil
of
rays
and
the
axial
called
the
fact
that
they
may
all
be
set
into
correspondence
with
each
other
is
expressed
by
saying
that
they
are
of
the
same
order
it
is
usual
also
to
speak
of
them
as
of
the
first
order
we
shall
see
presently
that
there
are
other
assemblages
which
can
not
be
put
into
this
sort
of
correspondence
with
the
points
on
a
line
and
that
they
will
very
reasonably
be
said
to
be
of
a
higher
order
perspective
position
we
have
said
that
a
and
a
pencil
of
rays
are
in
perspective
position
if
each
ray
of
the
pencil
goes
through
the
point
of
the
which
corresponds
to
it
two
pencils
of
rays
are
also
said
to
be
in
perspective
position
if
corresponding
rays
meet
on
a
straight
line
which
is
called
the
axis
of
perspectivity
also
two
are
said
to
be
in
perspective
position
if
corresponding
points
lie
on
straight
lines
through
a
point
which
is
called
the
center
of
perspectivity
a
and
an
axial
pencil
are
in
perspective
position
if
each
plane
of
the
pencil
goes
through
the
point
on
the
which
corresponds
to
it
and
an
axial
pencil
and
a
pencil
of
rays
are
in
perspective
position
if
each
ray
lies
in
the
plane
which
corresponds
to
it
and
finally
two
axial
pencils
are
perspectively
related
if
corresponding
planes
meet
in
a
plane
projective
relation
it
is
easy
to
imagine
a
more
general
correspondence
between
the
points
of
two
than
the
one
just
described
if
we
take
two
perspective
pencils
and
then
a
perspective
to
will
be
in
correspondence
with
a
perspective
to
but
corresponding
points
will
not
in
general
lie
on
lines
which
all
pass
through
a
point
two
such
are
said
to
be
or
simply
projective
to
each
other
similarly
two
pencils
of
rays
or
of
planes
are
projectively
related
to
each
other
if
they
are
perspective
to
two
perspective
this
idea
will
be
generalized
later
on
it
is
important
to
note
that
between
the
elements
of
two
projective
fundamental
forms
there
is
a
correspondence
and
also
that
this
correspondence
is
in
general
that
is
by
taking
two
elements
of
one
form
sufficiently
close
to
each
other
the
two
corresponding
elements
in
the
other
form
may
be
made
to
approach
each
other
arbitrarily
close
in
the
case
of
this
continuity
is
subject
to
exception
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
point
at
infinity
correspondence
it
might
be
inferred
that
any
infinite
assemblage
could
be
put
into
correspondence
with
any
other
such
is
not
the
case
however
if
the
correspondence
is
to
be
continuous
between
the
points
on
a
line
and
the
points
on
a
plane
consider
two
lines
which
lie
in
different
planes
and
take
points
on
one
and
points
on
the
other
the
number
of
lines
joining
the
points
of
one
to
the
points
jof
the
other
is
clearly
if
we
symbolize
the
totality
of
points
on
a
line
by
infinity
then
a
reasonable
symbol
for
the
totality
of
lines
drawn
to
cut
two
lines
would
be
infinity
clearly
for
every
point
on
one
line
there
are
infinity
lines
cutting
across
the
other
so
that
the
correspondence
might
be
called
infinity
thus
the
assemblage
of
lines
cutting
across
two
lines
is
of
higher
order
than
the
assemblage
of
points
on
a
line
and
as
we
have
called
the
an
assemblage
of
the
first
order
the
system
of
lines
cutting
across
two
lines
ought
to
be
called
of
the
second
order
infinitudes
of
different
orders
now
it
is
easy
to
set
up
a
correspondence
between
the
points
in
a
plane
and
the
system
of
lines
cutting
across
two
lines
which
lie
in
different
planes
in
fact
each
line
of
the
system
of
lines
meets
the
plane
in
one
point
and
each
point
in
the
plane
determines
one
and
only
one
line
cutting
across
the
two
given
the
line
of
intersection
of
the
two
planes
determined
by
the
given
point
with
each
of
the
given
lines
the
assemblage
of
points
in
the
plane
is
thus
of
the
same
order
as
that
of
the
lines
cutting
across
two
lines
which
lie
in
different
planes
and
ought
therefore
to
be
spoken
of
as
of
the
second
order
we
express
all
these
results
as
follows
if
the
infinitude
of
points
on
a
line
is
taken
as
the
infinitude
of
the
first
order
then
the
infinitude
of
lines
in
a
pencil
of
rays
and
the
infinitude
of
planes
in
an
axial
pencil
are
also
of
the
first
order
while
the
infinitude
of
lines
cutting
across
two
skew
lines
as
well
as
the
infinitude
of
points
in
a
plane
are
of
the
second
order
if
we
join
each
of
the
points
of
a
plane
to
a
point
not
in
that
plane
we
set
up
a
correspondence
between
the
points
in
a
plane
and
the
lines
through
a
point
in
space
the
infinitude
of
lines
through
a
point
in
space
is
of
the
second
if
to
each
line
through
a
point
in
space
we
make
correspond
that
plane
at
right
angles
to
it
and
passing
through
the
same
point
we
see
that
infinitude
of
planes
through
a
point
in
space
is
of
the
second
if
to
each
plane
through
a
point
in
space
we
make
correspond
the
line
in
which
it
intersects
a
given
plane
we
see
that
infinitude
of
lines
in
a
plane
is
of
the
second
this
may
also
be
seen
by
setting
up
a
correspondence
between
the
points
on
a
plane
and
the
lines
of
that
plane
thus
take
a
point
not
in
the
plane
join
any
point
of
the
plane
to
through
draw
a
plane
at
right
angles
to
this
meets
the
given
plane
in
a
line
which
may
be
taken
as
corresponding
to
the
point
another
very
important
method
of
setting
up
a
correspondence
between
lines
and
points
in
a
plane
will
be
given
later
and
many
weighty
consequences
will
be
derived
from
it
plane
system
and
point
system
the
plane
considered
as
made
up
of
the
points
and
lines
in
it
is
called
a
and
is
a
fundamental
form
of
the
second
order
the
point
considered
as
made
up
of
all
the
lines
and
planes
passing
through
it
is
called
a
and
is
also
a
fundamental
form
of
the
second
order
if
now
we
take
three
lines
in
space
all
lying
in
different
planes
and
select
points
on
the
first
points
on
the
second
and
points
on
the
third
then
the
total
number
of
planes
passing
through
one
of
the
selected
points
on
each
line
will
be
it
is
reasonable
therefore
to
symbolize
the
totality
of
planes
that
are
determined
by
the
infinity
points
on
each
of
the
three
lines
by
infinity
and
to
call
it
an
infinitude
of
the
order
but
it
is
easily
seen
that
every
plane
in
space
is
included
in
this
totality
so
that
totality
of
planes
in
space
is
an
infinitude
of
the
third
consider
now
the
planes
perpendicular
to
these
three
lines
every
set
of
three
planes
so
drawn
will
determine
a
point
in
space
and
conversely
through
every
point
in
space
may
be
drawn
one
and
only
one
set
of
three
planes
at
right
angles
to
the
three
given
lines
it
follows
therefore
that
totality
of
points
in
space
is
an
infinitude
of
the
third
space
system
space
of
three
dimensions
considered
as
made
up
of
all
its
planes
and
points
is
then
a
fundamental
form
of
the
order
which
we
shall
call
a
lines
in
space
if
we
join
the
twofold
infinity
of
points
in
one
plane
with
the
twofold
infinity
of
points
in
another
plane
we
get
a
totality
of
lines
of
space
which
is
of
the
fourth
order
of
infinity
totality
of
lines
in
space
gives
then
a
fundamental
form
of
the
fourth
correspondence
between
points
and
numbers
in
the
theory
of
analytic
geometry
a
correspondence
is
assumed
to
exist
between
points
on
a
line
and
numbers
in
order
to
justify
this
assumption
a
very
extended
definition
of
number
must
be
made
use
of
a
correspondence
is
then
set
up
between
points
in
the
plane
and
pairs
of
numbers
and
also
between
points
in
space
and
sets
of
three
numbers
a
single
constant
will
serve
to
define
the
position
of
a
point
on
a
line
two
a
point
in
the
plane
three
a
point
in
space
etc
in
the
same
theory
a
correspondence
is
set
up
between
loci
in
the
plane
and
equations
in
two
variables
between
surfaces
in
space
and
equations
in
three
variables
etc
the
equation
of
a
line
in
a
plane
involves
two
constants
either
of
which
may
take
an
infinite
number
of
values
from
this
it
follows
that
there
is
an
infinity
of
lines
in
the
plane
which
is
of
the
second
order
if
the
infinity
of
points
on
a
line
is
assumed
to
be
of
the
first
in
the
same
way
a
circle
is
determined
by
three
conditions
a
sphere
by
four
etc
we
might
then
expect
to
be
able
to
set
up
a
correspondence
between
circles
in
a
plane
and
points
or
planes
in
space
or
between
spheres
and
lines
in
space
such
indeed
is
the
case
and
it
is
often
possible
to
infer
theorems
concerning
spheres
from
theorems
concerning
lines
and
vice
versa
it
is
possibilities
such
as
these
that
give
to
the
theory
of
correspondence
its
great
importance
for
the
mathematician
it
must
not
be
forgotten
however
that
we
are
considering
only
correspondences
it
is
perfectly
possible
to
set
up
a
correspondence
between
the
points
of
a
line
and
the
points
of
a
plane
or
indeed
between
the
points
of
a
line
and
the
points
of
a
space
of
any
finite
number
of
dimensions
if
the
correspondence
is
not
restricted
to
be
continuous
elements
at
infinity
a
final
word
is
necessary
in
order
to
explain
a
phrase
which
is
in
constant
use
in
the
study
of
projective
geometry
we
have
spoken
of
the
point
at
infinity
on
a
straight
fictitious
point
only
used
to
bridge
over
the
exceptional
case
when
we
are
setting
up
a
correspondence
between
the
points
of
a
line
and
the
lines
through
a
point
we
speak
of
it
as
a
point
and
not
as
points
because
in
the
geometry
studied
by
euclid
we
assume
only
one
line
through
a
point
parallel
to
a
given
line
in
the
same
sense
we
speak
of
all
the
points
at
infinity
in
a
plane
as
lying
on
a
line
the
line
at
infinity
because
the
straight
line
is
the
simplest
locus
we
can
imagine
which
has
only
one
point
in
common
with
any
line
in
the
plane
likewise
we
speak
of
the
plane
at
infinity
because
that
seems
the
most
convenient
way
of
imagining
the
points
at
infinity
in
space
it
must
not
be
inferred
that
these
conceptions
have
any
essential
connection
with
physical
facts
or
that
other
means
of
picturing
to
ourselves
the
infinitely
distant
configurations
are
not
possible
in
other
branches
of
mathematics
notably
in
the
theory
of
functions
of
a
complex
variable
quite
different
assumptions
are
made
and
quite
different
conceptions
of
the
elements
at
infinity
are
used
as
we
can
know
nothing
experimentally
about
such
things
we
are
at
liberty
to
make
any
assumptions
we
please
so
long
as
they
are
consistent
and
serve
some
useful
purpose
problems
since
there
is
a
threefold
infinity
of
points
in
space
there
must
be
a
sixfold
infinity
of
pairs
of
points
in

each
pair
of
points
determines
a

why
then
is
there
not
a

of
lines
in

if
there
is

why
is
it

there

ii
relations
between
fundamental
forms
in
correspondence
with
each
other
seven
fundamental
forms
in
the
preceding
chapter
we
have
called
attention
to
seven
fundamental
forms
the
the
pencil
of
rays
the
axial
pencil
the
plane
system
the
point
system
the
space
system
and
the
system
of
lines
in
space
these
fundamental
forms
are
the
material
which
we
intend
to
use
in
building
up
a
general
theory
which
will
be
found
to
include
ordinary
geometry
as
a
special
case
we
shall
be
concerned
not
with
measurement
of
angles
and
areas
or
line
segments
as
in
the
study
of
euclid
but
in
combining
and
comparing
these
fundamental
forms
and
in
generating
new
forms
by
means
of
them
in
problems
of
construction
we
shall
make
no
use
of
measurement
either
of
angles
or
of
segments
and
except
in
certain
special
applications
of
the
general
theory
we
shall
not
find
it
necessary
to
require
more
of
ourselves
than
the
ability
to
draw
the
line
joining
two
points
or
to
find
the
point
of
intersections
of
two
lines
or
the
line
of
intersection
of
two
planes
or
in
general
the
common
elements
of
two
fundamental
forms
projective
properties
our
chief
interest
in
this
chapter
will
be
the
discovery
of
relations
between
the
elements
of
one
form
which
hold
between
the
corresponding
elements
of
any
other
form
in
correspondence
with
it
we
have
already
called
attention
to
the
danger
of
assuming
that
whatever
relations
hold
between
the
elements
of
one
assemblage
must
also
hold
between
the
corresponding
elements
of
any
assemblage
in
correspondence
with
it
this
false
assumption
is
the
basis
of
the
proof
by
analogy
so
much
in
vogue
among
speculative
theorists
when
it
appears
that
certain
relations
existing
between
the
points
of
a
given
do
not
necessitate
the
same
relations
between
the
corresponding
elements
of
another
in
correspondence
with
it
we
should
view
with
suspicion
any
application
of
the
proof
by
analogy
in
realms
of
thought
where
accurate
judgments
are
not
so
easily
made
for
example
if
in
a
given
three
points
and
are
taken
such
that
is
the
middle
point
of
the
segment
it
does
not
follow
that
the
three
points
in
a
perspective
to
will
be
so
related
relations
between
the
elements
of
any
form
which
do
go
over
unaltered
to

theorem
we
consider
first
the
following
beautiful
theorem
due
to
desargues
and
called
by
his
name
two
triangles
and
are
so
situated
that
the
lines

all
meet
in
a
point
then
the
pairs
of
sides
and
and
and
all
meet
on
a
straight
line

let
the
lines
and
meet
in
the

conceive
of
the
figure
as
in
space
so
that
is
the
vertex
of
a
trihedral
angle
of
which
the
given
triangles
are
plane
sections
the
lines
and
are
in
the
same
plane
and
must
meet
when
produced
their
point
of
intersection
being
clearly
a
point
in
the
plane
of
each
triangle
and
therefore
in
the
line
of
intersection
of
these
two
planes
call
this
point
by
similar
reasoning
the
point
of
intersection
of
the
lines
and
must
lie
on
this
same
line
as
well
as
the
point
of

therefore
the
points

all
lie
on
the
same
line
if
now
we
consider
the
figure

plane

points

still
all
lie
on
a
straight
line
which
proves
the
theorem
the
converse
is
established
in
the
same
manner
fundamental
theorem
concerning
two
complete
quadrangles
this
theorem
throws
into
our
hands
the
following
fundamental
theorem
concerning
two
complete
quadrangles
a
being
defined
as
the
figure
obtained
by
joining
any
four
given
points
by
straight
lines
in
the
six
possible
ways
two
complete
quadrangles
and
so
related
that
all
meet
in
a
point
all
meet
in
a
point
and
meet
in
a
point
on
the
line
then
the
lines
and
also
meet
in
a
point
on
the
line
figure
fig
for
by
the
converse
of
the
last
theorem
and
all
meet
in
a
point
fig
also
and
meet
in
a
point
and
therefore
in
the
same
point
thus
and
meet
in
a
point
and
so
by
theorem
itself
and
are
on
a
straight
line
importance
of
the
theorem
the
importance
of
this
theorem
lies
in
the
fact
that
and
being
given
an
indefinite
number
of
quadrangles
my
be
found
such
that
and
meet
in
and
in
with
passing
through
indeed
the
lines
and
may
be
drawn
arbitrarily
through
and
any
line
through
may
be
used
to
determine
and
by
joining
these
two
points
to
the
points
and
are
determined
then
the
line
joining
and
found
in
this
way
must
pass
through
the
point
already
determined
by
the
quadrangle
three
points
given
in
order
serve
thus
to
determine
a
fourth
point
in
a
complete
quadrangle
the
line
joining
any
two
points
is
called
the
to
the
line
joining
the
other
two
points
the
result
of
the
preceding
paragraph
may
then
be
stated
as
follows
given
three
points
in
a
straight
line
if
a
pair
of
opposite
sides
of
a
complete
quadrangle
pass
through
and
another
pair
through
and
one
of
the
remaining
two
sides
goes
through
then
the
other
of
the
remaining
two
sides
will
go
through
a
fixed
point
which
does
not
depend
on
the
quadrangle
employed
four
harmonic
points
four
points
related
as
in
the
preceding
theorem
are
called
harmonic
the
point
is
called
the
harmonic
of
with
respect
to
and
since
and
play
exactly
the
same
rôle
in
the
above
construction
is
also
the
fourth
harmonic
of
with
respect
to
and
and
are
called
conjugates
with
respect
to
and
we
proceed
to
show
that
and
are
also
harmonic
conjugates
with
respect
to
and
is
that
it
is
possible
to
find
a
quadrangle
of
which
two
opposite
sides
shall
pass
through
two
through
and
of
the
remaining
pair
one
through
and
the
other
through
figure
fig
let
be
the
intersection
of
and
fig
join
to
and
the
joining
lines
cut
out
on
the
sides
of
the
quadrangle
four
points
consider
the
quadrangle
one
pair
of
opposite
sides
passes
through
one
through
and
one
remaining
side
through
therefore
the
other
remaining
side
must
pass
through
similarly
passes
through
and
and
pass
through
the
quadrangle
therefore
has
two
opposite
sides
through
two
through
and
the
remaining
pair
through
and
and
are
thus
harmonic
conjugates
with
respect
to
and
we
may
sum
up
the
discussion
therefore
as
follows
if
and
are
harmonic
conjugates
with
respect
to
and
then
and
are
harmonic
conjugates
with
respect
to
and
importance
of
the
notion
the
importance
of
the
notion
of
four
harmonic
points
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
is
a
relation
which
is
carried
over
from
four
points
in
a
to
the
four
points
that
correspond
to
them
in
any
perspective
to
to
prove
this
statement
we
construct
a
quadrangle
such
that
and
pass
through
and
through
through
and
through
take
now
any
point
not
in
the
plane
of
the
quadrangle
and
construct
the
planes
determined
by
and
all
the
seven
lines
of
the
figure
cut
across
this
set
of
planes
by
another
plane
not
passing
through
this
plane
cuts
out
on
the
set
of
seven
planes
another
quadrangle
which
determines
four
new
harmonic
points
on
the
lines
joining
to
but
may
be
taken
as
any
point
since
the
original
quadrangle
may
be
taken
in
any
plane
through
and
further
the
points
are
the
intersection
of
by
any
line
we
have
then
the
remarkable
theorem
any
point
is
joined
to
four
harmonic
points
and
the
four
lines
thus
obtained
are
cut
by
any
fifth
the
four
points
of
intersection
are
again
four
harmonic
lines
we
are
now
able
to
extend
the
notion
of
harmonic
elements
to
pencils
of
rays
and
indeed
to
axial
pencils
for
if
we
define
harmonic
as
four
rays
which
pass
through
a
point
and
which
pass
one
through
each
of
four
harmonic
points
we
have
the
theorem
harmonic
lines
are
cut
by
any
transversal
in
four
harmonic
four
harmonic
planes
we
also
define
harmonic
as
four
planes
through
a
line
which
pass
one
through
each
of
four
harmonic
points
and
we
may
show
that
harmonic
planes
are
cut
by
any
plane
not
passing
through
their
common
line
in
four
harmonic
lines
and
also
by
any
line
in
four
harmonic
for
let
the
planes
α
β
γ
δ
which
all
pass
through
the
line
pass
also
through
the
four
harmonic
points
so
that
α
passes
through
etc
then
it
is
clear
that
any
plane
π
through
will
cut
out
four
harmonic
lines
from
the
four
planes
for
they
are
lines
through
the
intersection
of
with
the
plane
π
and
they
pass
through
the
given
harmonic
points
any
other
plane
σ
cuts
in
a
point
and
cuts
α
β
γ
δ
in
four
lines
that
meet
π
in
four
points
lying
on
and
respectively
and
are
thus
four
harmonic
hues
further
any
ray
cuts
α
β
γ
δ
in
four
harmonic
points
since
any
plane
through
the
ray
gives
four
harmonic
lines
of
intersection
these
results
may
be
put
together
as
follows
any
two
assemblages
of
points
rays
or
planes
perspectively
related
to
each
other
four
harmonic
elements
of
one
must
correspond
to
four
elements
of
the
other
which
are
likewise
if
now
two
forms
are
perspectively
related
to
a
third
any
four
harmonic
elements
of
one
must
correspond
to
four
harmonic
elements
in
the
other
we
take
this
as
our
definition
of
projective
correspondence
and
say
definition
of
projectivity
fundamental
forms
are
protectively
related
to
each
other
when
a
correspondence
exists
between
the
elements
of
the
two
and
when
four
harmonic
elements
of
one
correspond
to
four
harmonic
elements
of
the
figure
fig
correspondence
between
harmonic
conjugates
given
four
harmonic
points
if
we
fix
and
then
and
vary
together
in
a
way
that
should
be
thoroughly
understood
to
get
a
clear
conception
of
their
relative
motion
we
may
fix
the
points
and
of
the
quadrangle
fig
then
as
describes
the
the
point
describes
the
perspective
to
it
projecting
again
from
we
get
a
on
perspective
to
the
and
thus
projective
to
the
project
the
from
and
we
get
a
on
again
which
is
projective
to
the
for
every
point
we
have
thus
one
and
only
one
point
and
conversely
in
other
words
we
have
set
up
a
correspondence
between
the
points
of
a
single
which
is
also
a
projective
correspondence
because
four
harmonic
points
correspond
to
four
harmonic
points
we
may
note
also
that
the
correspondence
is
here
characterized
by
a
feature
which
does
not
always
appear
in
projective
correspondences
namely
the
same
process
that
carries
one
from
to
will
carry
one
back
from
to
again
this
special
property
will
receive
further
study
in
the
chapter
on
involution
it
is
seen
that
as
approaches
also
approaches
as
moves
from
toward
moves
from
in
the
opposite
direction
passing
through
the
point
at
infinity
on
the
line
and
returns
on
the
other
side
to
meet
at
again
in
other
words
as
traverses

the
rest
of
the
line

all
positions
of

at
or
and
are
separated
from
each

harmonic
conjugate
of
the

it
is
natural
to
inquire
what
position
of
corresponds
to
the
infinitely
distant
position
of
we
have
proved
that
the
particular
quadrangle
employed
is
of
no
consequence
we
shall
therefore
avail
ourselves
of
one
that
lends
itself
most
readily
to
the
solution
of
the
problem
we
choose
the
point
so
that
the
triangle
is
isosceles
fig
since
is
supposed
to
be
at
infinity
the
line
is
parallel
to
therefore
the
triangles
and
are
equal
and
the
triangle
is
also
isosceles
the
triangles
and
are
therefore
equal
and
the
line
bisects
the
angle
is
therefore
the
middle
point
of

we
have
the
theorem

of
the

this
theorem
is
the

between
the
general
protective
theorems
which
we
have
been
considering
so
far
and
the
metrical
theorems
of
ordinary
geometry
up
to
this
point

have
said
nothing
about

the

of

which
depends
on

nothing
to
do
with
magnitudes
at
all
not
until
the
notion
of
an
infinitely
distant
point
is
brought
in
is
any
mention
made
of
distances
or
directions
we
have
been
able
to
make
all
of
our
constructions
up
to
this
point
by
means
of
the
straightedge
or
ungraduated
ruler
a
construction
made
with
such
an
instrument
we
shall
call
a
construction
it
requires
merely
that
we
be
able
to
draw
the
line
joining
two
points
or
find
the
point
of
intersection
of
two
lines
parallels
and
it
might
be
thought
that
drawing
a
line
through
a
given
point
parallel
to
a
given
line
was
only
a
special
case
of
drawing
a
line
joining
two
points
indeed
it
consists
only
in
drawing
a
line
through
the
given
point
and
through
the
infinitely
distant
point
on
the
given
line
it
must
be
remembered
however
that
the
expression
infinitely
distant
point
must
not
be
taken
literally
when
we
say
that
two
parallel
lines
meet
at
infinity
we
really
mean
that
they
do
not
meet
at
all
and
the
only
reason
for
using
the
expression
is
to
avoid
tedious
statement
of
exceptions
and
restrictions
to
our
theorems
we
ought
therefore
to
consider
the
drawing
of
a
line
parallel
to
a
given
line
as
a
different
accomplishment
from
the
drawing
of
the
line
joining
two
given
points
it
is
a
remarkable
consequence
of
the
last
theorem
that
a
parallel
to
a
given
line
and
the
of
a
given
segment
are
equivalent
data
for
the
construction
is
reversible
and
if
we
are
given
the
middle
point
of
a
given
segment
we
can
construct
a
line
parallel
to
that
segment
thus
given
that
is
the
middle
point
of
we
may
draw
any
two
lines
through
and
any
line
through
cutting
them
in
points
and
join
and
to
and
get
the
points
and
on
the
two
lines
through
then
is
parallel
to
bisection
of
a
given
segment
and
the
drawing
of
a
line
parallel
to
the
segment
are
equivalent
data
when
linear
construction
is
it
is
not
difficult
to
give
a
linear
construction
for
the
problem
to
divide
a
given
segment
into
equal
parts
given
only
a
parallel
to
the
segment
this
is
simple
enough
when
is
a
power
of
for
any
other
number
such
as
divide
any
segment
on
the
line
parallel
to
into
equal
parts
by
a
repetition
of
the
process
just
described
take
of
these
and
join
the
first
to
and
the
last

let
these
joining
lines
meet

to
all
the
other
points
other
problems
of
a
similar
sort
are
given
at
the
end
of
the
chapter
numerical
relations
since
three
points
given
in
order
are
sufficient
to
determine
a
fourth
as
explained
above
it
ought
to
be
possible
to
reproduce
the
process
numerically
in
view
of
the
correspondence
which
exists
between
points
on
a
line
and
numbers
a
correspondence
which
to
be
sure
we
have
not
established
here
but
which
is
discussed
in
any
treatise
on
the
theory
of
point
sets
we
proceed
to
discover
what
relation
between
four
numbers
corresponds
to
the
harmonic
relation
between
four
points
figure
fig
let
be
four
harmonic
points
fig
and
let
be
four
harmonic
lines
assume
a
line
drawn
through
parallel
to
meeting
in
and
in
then
and
the
infinitely
distant
point
on
are
four
harmonic
points
and
therefore
is
the
middle
point
of
the
segment
then
since
the
triangle
is
similar
to
the
triangle
we
may
write
the
proportion
ad
also
from
the
similar
triangles
and
we
have
cb
sd
from
these
two
proportions
we
have
remembering
that
formula
the
minus
sign
being
given
to
the
ratio
on
account
of
the
fact
that
and
are
always
separated
from
and
so
that
one
or
three
of
the
segments
must
be
negative
writing
the
last
equation
in
the
form
ab
ad
and
using
the
fundamental
relation
connecting
three
points
on
a
line
rq
pq
which
holds
for
all
positions
of
the
three
points
if
account
be
taken
of
the
sign
of
the
segments
the
last
proportion
may
be
written
cb

ab

ab

so
that
and
are
three
quantities
in
hamonic
progression
since
the
difference
between
the
first
and
second
is
to
the
first
as
the
difference
between
the
second
and
third
is
to
the
third
also
from
this
last
proportion
comes
the
familiar
relation

which
is
convenient
for

computation
of

the
corresponding
relations
between
the
trigonometric
functions
of
the
angles
determined
by

harmonic
lines
are
not
difficult
to
obtain
but
as
we
shall
not
need
them
in
building
up
the
theory
of
projective
geometry
we
will
not
discuss
them
here

who
have
a
slight
acquaintance
with
trigonometry
may
read
in

combination

forms
figure
fig
superposed
fundamental
forms
elements
we
have
seen
that
two
projective
may
be
superposed
upon
the
same
straight
line
this
happens
for
example
when
two
pencils
which
are
projective
to
each
other
are
cut
across
by
a
straight
line
it
is
also
possible
for
two
projective
pencils
to
have
the
same
center
this
happens
for
example
when
two
projective
are
projected
to
the
same
point
similarly
two
projective
axial
pencils
may
have
the
same
axis
we
examine
now
the
possibility
of
two
forms
related
in
this
way
having
an
element
or
elements
that
correspond
to
themselves
we
have
seen
indeed
that
if
and
are
harmonic
conjugates
with
respect
to
and
then
the
described
by
is
projective
to
the
described
by
and
that
and
are
points
consider
more
generally
the
case
of
two
pencils
perspective
to
each
other
with
axis
of
perspectivity
fig
cut
across
them
by
a
line
we
get
thus
two
projective
superposed
on
the
same
line
and
a
reflection
serves
to
show
that
the
point
of
intersection
and
corresponds
to
itself
in
the
two
also
the
point
where
intersects
the
line
joining
the
centers
of
the
two
pencils
is
seen
to
correspond
to
itself
it
is
thus
possible
for
two
projective
superposed
upon
the
same
line
to
have
two
points
clearly
and
may
fall
together
if
the
line
joining
the
centers
of
the
pencils
happens
to
pass
through
the
point
of
intersection
of
the
lines
and
figure
fig
we
may
also
give
an
illustration
of
a
case
where
two
superposed
projective
have
no
points
at
all
thus
we
may
take
two
lines
revolving
about
a
fixed
point
and
always
making
the
same
angle
a
with
each
other
fig
they
will
cut
out
on
any
line
in
the
plane
two
which
are
easily
seen
to
be
projective
for
given
any
four
rays
which
are
harmonic
the
four
corresponding
rays
must
also
be
harmonic
since
they
make
the
same
angles
with
each
other
four
harmonic
points
correspond
therefore
to
four
harmonic
points
it
is
clear
however
that
no
point
can
coincide
with
its
corresponding
point
for
in
that
case
the
lines
and
would
coincide
which
is
impossible
if
the
angle
between
them
is
to
be
constant
fundamental
theorem
postulate
of
continuity
we
have
thus
shown
that
two
projective
superposed
one
on
the
other
may
have
two
points
one
point
or
no
point
at
all
corresponding
to
themselves
we
proceed
to
show
that
two
projective
superposed
upon
the
same
straight
line
have
more
than
two
points
they
must
have
an
infinite
number
and
every
point
corresponds
to
itself
that
is
the
two
are
not
essentially
if
three
points
and
are
then
the
harmonic
conjugate
of
with
respect
to
and
must
also
correspond
to
itself
for
four
harmonic
points
must
always
correspond
to
four
harmonic
points
in
the
same
way
the
harmonic
conjugate
of
with
respect
to
and
must
correspond
to
itself
combining
new
points
with
old
in
this
way
we
may
obtain
as
many
points
as
we
wish
we
show
further
that
every
point
on
the
line
is
the
limiting
point
of
a
finite
or
infinite
sequence
of
points
thus
let
a
point
lie
between
and
construct
now
the
fourth
harmonic
of
with
respect
to
and
may
coincide
with
in
which
case
the
sequence
is
closed
otherwise
lies
in
the
stretch
or
in
the
stretch
if
it
lies
in
the
stretch
construct
the
fourth
harmonic
of
with
respect
to
and
this
point
may
coincide
with
in
which
case
as
before
the
sequence
is
closed
if
lies
in
the
stretch
we
construct
the
fourth
harmonic
of
with
respect
to
etc
in
each
step
the
region
in
which
lies
is
diminished
and
the
process
may
be
continued
until
two
points
are
obtained
on
either
side
of
and
at
distances
from
it
arbitrarily
small
we
now
assume
explicitly
the
fundamental
postulate
that
the
correspondence
is
that
is
that
distance
between
two
points
in
one
may
be
made
arbitrarily
small
by
sufficiently
diminishing
the
distance
between
the
corresponding
points
in
the
suppose
now
that
is
not
a
point
but
corresponds
to
a
point
at
a
fixed
distance
from
as
noted
above
we
can
find
points
arbitrarily
close
to
and
it
appears
then
that
we
can
take
a
point
as
close
to
as
we
wish
and
yet
the
distance
between
the
corresponding
points
and
approaches
as
a
limit
and
not
zero
which
contradicts
the
postulate
of
continuity
it
follows
also
that
two
projective
pencils
which
have
the
same
center
may
have
no
more
than
two
rays
unless
the
pencils
are
identical
for
if
we
cut
across
them
by
a
line
we
obtain
two
projective
superposed
on
the
same
straight
line
which
may
have
no
more
than
two
points
the
same
considerations
apply
to
two
projective
axial
pencils
which
have
the
same
axis
projective
having
a
point
in
common
consider
now
two
projective
lying
on
different
lines
in
the
same
plane
their
common
point
may
or
may
not
be
a
point
if
the
two
are
perspectively
related
then
their
common
point
is
evidently
a
point
the
converse
is
also
true
and
we
have
the
very
important
theorem
in
two
protective
the
point
of
intersection
corresponds
to
itself
then
the
are
in
perspective
figure
fig
let
the
two
be
and
fig
let
and
and
be
corresponding
points
and
let
also
the
point
of
intersection
of
and
correspond
to
itself
let
and
meet
in
the
point
take
as
the
center
of
two
pencils
one
perspective
to
and
the
other
perspective
to
in
these
two
pencils
coincides
with
its
corresponding
ray
with
its
corresponding
ray
and
with
its
corresponding
ray
the
two
pencils
are
thus
identical
by
the
preceding
theorem
and
any
ray
must
coincide
with
its
corresponding
ray
corresponding
points
of
and
therefore
all
lie
on
lines
through
the
point
an
entirely
similar
discussion
shows
that
in
two
projective
pencils
the
line
joining
their
centers
is
a
ray
then
the
two
pencils
are
perspectively
a
similar
theorem
may
be
stated
for
two
axial
pencils
of
which
the
axes
intersect
very
frequent
use
will
be
made
of
these
fundamental
theorems
of
the
second
order
the
question
naturally
arises
what
is
the
locus
of
points
of
intersection
of
corresponding
rays
of
two
projective
pencils
which
are
not
in
perspective
position
this
locus
which
will
be
discussed
in
detail
in
subsequent
chapters
is
easily
seen
to
have
at
most
two
points
in
common
with
any
line
in
the
plane
and
on
account
of
this
fundamental
property
will
be
called
a
of
the
second

any
line

the
plane
of
the
two
pencils
will
be
cut
by
them
in
two
projective
which
have
at
most
two
points
such
a
point
is
clearly
a
point
of
intersection
of
corresponding
rays
of
the
two
pencils
this
locus
degenerates
in
the
case
of
two
perspective
pencils
to
a
pair
of
straight
lines

of
which
is
the
axis
of
perspectivity

the
other
the

may
be
considered
as
the
point
of

similar
investigations
may
be
made
concerning
the
system
of
lines
joining
corresponding
points
of

projective

we
project
the
to
any
point
in
the
plane
we
obtain
two
projective
pencils
having
the

center
at
most
two
pairs
of
rays

present
themselves
such
a
ray
is
clearly
a
line
joining
two
corresponding
points
in
the
two
the
result
may
be
stated
as
follows
system
of
rays
joining
corresponding
points
in
two
protective
has
at
most
two
rays
in
common
with
any
pencil
in
the
for
that
reason
the
system
of
rays
is
called
pencil
of
rays
of
the
second
in
the
case
of
two

this
system
of
rays
degenerates
into
two
pencils
of
rays
of
the
first
order
one
of
which
has
its
center
at
the
center
of

of
the

may
be
considered
as
joining

easily
be
obtained
by

thus
generating

called

it
in

cuts
it

study
first
the
of

we
have
shown
in
the
last
chapter
that
the
locus
of

of

of

is
a
of
the
second
order
that
is
it
has
at

two
points
in

with
any
line
in
the

it
is
clear
first
of
all
that
the
centers
of
the
pencils
are
points
of
the
locus
for
to
the
line
considered
as
a
ray

correspond

of
which
meets
it
in

by
the

argument
is
then
a
point
where
corresponding

meet
any

will
meet
it
in
one

the

by
choosing

the

may
be
made
to
differ
in

as
we
please
we
have
then
the
important
theorem

determination
of
the

we
now
show
that
is
possible
to
assign
arbitrarily
the
position
of
three
points
and
on
the
locus
besides
the
points
and
but
these

this
statement
is
equivalent
to
the
following
three
pairs
of
corresponding

in
two
projective
pencils
it
is
possible
to
find
a
ray
of

which
corresponds
to

we
proceed
then
to
the
solution
of
the
fundamental
problem
three

of

and
of
two

and
to
find
the
ray
of

as
a

to

as
a
perspective
to

are
projectively
related
to
each
other
since
and
are
by
hypothesis
so
related
but
their
point
of
intersection
is
a
point
since
and
were
supposed
to
be
corresponding
rays
it
follows
that
and
are
in
perspective
position
and
that
lines
through
corresponding
points
all
pass
through
a
point
the
center
of
perspectivity
the
position
of
which
will
be
determined
by
any
two
such
lines
but
the
intersection
of
with
and
the
intersection
of
with

corresponding
points
on

and
the
line
joining
them
is
clearly
itself
similarly
joins
two
corresponding
points
on

so
the
center
of

of

is
the
intersection
of

to
find

note
the
point

to
and
get
the
point
where
this
line
meets
and
are
corresponding
points
on
and
and
must
therefore
pass
through
the
intersection
of
and
is
thus
another
point
on
the
locus
in
the
same
manner
any
number
of
other
points
may
be
obtained
the
lines
and
might
have
been
drawn
in
any
direction
through
avoiding
of
course
the
line
for
and
the
line
for
and
the
center
of
perspectivity
would
be
easily
obtainable
but
the
above
construction
furnishes
a
simple
and
instructive
figure
an
equally
simple
one
is
obtained
by
taking
for
and
for
lines
joining
four
points
of
the
locus
to
a
fifth
suppose
that
the
points
and
are
fixed
and
that
four
points
and
are
taken
on
the
locus
at
the
intersection
with
it
of
any
four
harmonic
rays
through
these
four
harmonic
rays
give
four
harmonic
points
on
the
fixed
ray
these
in
turn
project
through
the
fixed
point
into
four
harmonic
points
on
the
fixed
line
these
last
four
harmonic
points
give
four
harmonic
rays
therefore
the
four
points
which
project
to
in
four
harmonic
rays
also
project
to
in
four
harmonic
rays
but
may
be
any
point
on
the
locus
and
so
we
have
the
very
important
theorem
points
which
are
on
the
locus
and
which
project
to
a
fifth
point
of
the
locus
in
four
harmonic
rays
project
to
any
point
of
the
locus
in
four
harmonic
the
theorem
may
also
be
stated
thus
locus
of
points
from
which
four
given
points
are
seen
along
four
harmonic
rays
is
a
of
the
second
order
through
a
further
theorem
of
prime
importance
also
follows
two
points
on
the
locus
may
be
taken
as
the
centers
of
two
projective
pencils
which
will
generate
the
theorem
the
points
and
may
thus
be
considered
as
chosen
arbitrarily
on
the
locus
and
the
following
remarkable
theorem
follows
at
once
six
points
on
the
of
the
second
order
if
we
the
intersection
of
with
the
intersection
of
with
the
intersection
of
with
and
are
on
a
straight
figure
fig
to
get
the
notation
to
correspond
to
the
figure
we
may
take
fig
and
if
we
make
and
the
points
and
are
interchanged
but
the
line
is
left
unchanged
it
is
clear
that
one
point
may
be
named
arbitrarily
and
the
other
five
named
in
different
ways
but
since
as
we
have
seen
two
different
assignments
of
names
give
the
same
line
it
follows
that
there
can
not
be
more
than
different
lines
obtained
in
this
way
from
a
given
set
of
six
points
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
number
obtained
in
this
way
is
in
general
the
above
theorem
which
is
of
cardinal
importance
in
the
theory
of
the
of
the
second
order
is
due
to
pascal
and
was
discovered
by
him
at
the
age
of
sixteen
it
is
no
doubt
the
most
important
contribution
to
the
theory
of
these
loci
since
the
days
of
apollonius
if
the
six
points
be
called
the
vertices
of
a
hexagon
inscribed
in
the
curve
then
the
sides
and
may
be
appropriately
called
a
pair
of
opposite
sides
theorem
then
may
be
stated
as
follows
three
pairs
of
opposite
sides
of
a
hexagon
inscribed
in
a
of
the
second
order
meet
in
three
points
on
a
harmonic
points
on
a
of
the
second
order
before
proceeding
to
develop
the
consequences
of
this
theorem
we
note
another
result
of
the
utmost
importance
for
the
higher
developments
of
pure
geometry
which
follows
from
the
fact
that
if
four
points
on
the
locus
project
to
a
fifth
in
four
harmonic
rays
they
will
project
to
any
point
of
the
locus
in
four
harmonic
rays
it
is
natural
to
speak
of
four
such
points
as
four
harmonic
points
on
the
locus
and
to
use
this
notion
to
define
projective
correspondence
between
of
the
second
order
or
between
a
of
the
second
order
and
any
fundamental
form
of
the
first
order
thus
in
particular
the
of
the
second
order
σ
is
said
to
be
to
the
pencil
when
every
ray
on
goes
through
the
point
on
σ
which
corresponds
to
it
determination
of
the
locus
it
is
now
clear
that
five
points
arbitrarily
chosen
in
the
plane
are
sufficient
to
determine
a
of
the
second
order
through
them
two
of
the
points
may
be
taken
as
centers
of
two
projective
pencils
and
the
three
others
will
determine
three
pairs
of
corresponding
rays
of
the
pencils
and
therefore
all
pairs
if
four
points
of
the
locus
are
given
together
with
the
tangent
at
one
of
them
the
locus
is
likewise
completely
determined
for
if
the
point
at
which
the
tangent
is
given
be
taken
as
the
center
of
one
pencil
and
any
other
of
the
points
for
then
besides
the
two
pairs
of
corresponding
rays
determined
by
the
remaining
two
points
we
have
one
more
pair
consisting
of
the
tangent
at
and
the
ray
similarly
the
curve
is
determined
by
three
points
and
the
tangents
at
two
of
them
circles
and
conics
as
of
the
second
order
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
that
a
circle
is
a
of
the
second
order
indeed
take
any
point
on
the
circle
and
draw
four
harmonic
rays
through
it
they
will
cut
the
circle
in
four
points
which
will
project
to
any
other
point
of
the
curve
in
four
harmonic
rays
for
by
the
theorem
concerning
the
angles
inscribed
in
a
circle
the
angles
involved
in
the
second
set
of
four
lines
are
the
same
as
those
in
the
first
set
if
moreover
we
project
the
figure
to
any
point
in
space
we
shall
get
a
cone
standing
on
a
circular
base
generated
by
two
projective
axial
pencils
which
are
the
projections
of
the
pencils
at
and
cut
across
now
by
any
plane
and
we
get
a
conic
section
which
is
thus
exhibited
as
the
locus
of
intersection
of
two
projective
pencils
it
thus
appears
that
a
conic
section
is
a
of
the
second
order
it
will
later
appear
that
a
of
the
second
order
is
a
conic
section
in
the
future
therefore
we
shall
refer
to
a
of
the
second

v

second
order
pencil
of
rays
of
the
second
order
defined
if
the
corresponding
points
of
two
projective
be
joined
by
straight
lines
a
system
of
lines
is
obtained
which
is
called
a
pencil
of
rays
of
the
second
order
this
name
arises
from
the
fact
easily
shown
that
at
most
two
lines
of
the
system
may
pass
through
any
arbitrary
point
in
the
plane
for
if
through
any
point
there
should
pass
three
lines
of
the
system
then
this
point
might
be
taken
as
the
center
of
two
projective
pencils
one
projecting
one
and
the
other
projecting
the
other
since
now
these
pencils
have
three
rays
of
one
coincident
with
the
corresponding
rays
of
the
other
the
two
are
identical
and
the
two
are
in

position
which
was
not
supposed
figure
fig
tangents
to
a
circle
to
get
a
clear
notion
of
this
system
of
lines
we
may
first
show
that
the
tangents
to
a
circle
form
a
system
of
this
kind
for
take
any
two
tangents
and
to
a
circle
and
let
and
be
the
points
of
contact
fig
let
now
be
any
third
tangent
with
point
of
contact
at
and
meeting
and
in
and
respectively
join
and
to
the
center
of
the
circle
tangents
from
any
point
to
a
circle
are
equal
and
therefore
the
triangles
and
are
equal
as
also
are
the
triangles
and
therefore
the
angle
is
constant
being
equal
to
half
the
constant
angle
this
being
true
if
we
take
any
four
harmonic
points
on
the
line
they
will
project
to
in
four
harmonic
lines
and
the
tangents
to
the
circle
from
these
four
points
will
meet
in
four
harmonic
points
because
the
lines
from
these
points
to
inclose
the
same
angles
as
the
lines
from
the
points
on
the
on
is
therefore
projective
to
the
on
thus
the
tangents
to
a
circle
are
seen
to
join
corresponding
points
on
two
projective
and
so
according
to
the
definition
form
a
pencil
of
rays
of
the
second
order
tangents
to
a
conic
if
now
this
figure
be
projected
to
a
point
outside
the
plane
of
the
circle
and
any
section
of
the
resulting
cone
be
made
by
a
plane
we
can
easily
see
that
the
system
of
rays
tangent
to
any
conic
section
is
a
pencil
of
rays
of
the
second
order
the
converse
is
also
true
as
we
shall
see
later
and
a
pencil
of
rays
of
the
second
order
is
also
a
set
of
lines
tangent
to
a
conic
section
the
and
are
themselves
lines
of
the
system
for
to
the
common
point
of
the
two
considered
as
a
point
of
must
correspond
some
point
of
and
the
line
joining
these
two
corresponding
points
is
clearly
itself
similarly
for
the
line
determination
of
the
pencil
we
now
show
that
is
possible
to
assign
arbitrarily
three
lines
and
of
the
system
besides
the
lines
and
but
if
these
three
lines
are
chosen
the
system
is
completely
this
statement
is
equivalent
to
the
following
three
pairs
of
corresponding
points
in
two
projective
it
is
possible
to
find
a
point
in
one
which
corresponds
to
any
point
of
the
we
proceed
then
to
the
solution
of
the
fundamental
problem
three
pairs
of
points
and
of
two
projective
and
to
find
the
point
of
which
corresponds
to
any
given
point
of
figure
fig
on
the
line
joining
and
take
two
points
and
as

of

respectively
fig
the
figure
will
be
much
simplified
if
we
take
on
and
on
and
are
corresponding
rays
of
and
and
the
two
pencils
are
therefore
in
perspective
position
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
that
the
axis
of
perspectivity
is
the
line
joining
and
given
any
point
on
to
find
the
corresponding
point
on
we
proceed
as
follows
join
to
and
note
where
the
joining
line
meets
join
this
point
to
this
last
line
meets
in
the
desired
point
we
have
now
in
this
figure
six
lines
of
the
system
and
fix
now
the
position
of
and
and
take
four
lines
of
the
system
which
meet
in
four
harmonic
points
these
points
project
to
giving
four
harmonic
points
on
these
again
project
to
giving
four
harmonic
points
on
it
is
thus
clear
that
the
rays
cut
out
two
projective
on
any
two
lines
of
the
system
thus
and
are
not
special
rays
and
any
two
rays
of
the
system
will
serve
as
the
to
generate
the

will
not
have
failed
to
note
the
remarkable
similarity
between
the
theorems
of
this
chapter
and
those
of
the
preceding
he
will
have
noted
that
points
have
replaced
lines
and
lines
have
replaced
points
that
points
on
a
curve
have
been
replaced
by
tangents
to
a
curve
that
pencils
have
been
replaced
by
and
that
a
conic
considered
as
made
up
of
a
succession
of
points
has
been
replaced
by
a
conic
considered
as
generated
by
a
moving
tangent

wonderful

theorems
have
been
noted
as
special
cases
of

theorems
a

inscribed
in
a
conic
two
pairs
of
opposite
sides
and
the
tangents
at
opposite
vertices
intersect
in
four
points

of
which
lie

straight

circumscribed
about
a
conic
the
lines
joining
two
pairs
of
opposite
vertices
and
the
lines
joining
two
opposite
points
of
contact
are
four
lines
which
meet
in
a
figure

a

the
quadrilateral
inscribed
in
the
conic

determines
the
four
harmonic
points
which
project
from
in
to
the
four
harmonic
points
now
the
tangents
at
and
meet
in
a
point
on
the
line
the
line
is
thus
determined
entirely
by
the
point
for
if
we
draw
any
line
through
it
meeting
the
conic
in
and
and
construct
the
harmonic
conjugate
of
with
respect
to
and
and
also
the
two
tangents
at
and
which
meet
in
the
point
then
is
the
line
in
question
it
thus
appears
that
the
line
may
be
any
line
whatever
through
and
since
are
four
harmonic
points
we
may
describe
the
line
as
the
locus
of
points
which
are
harmonic
conjugates
of
with
respect
to
the
two
points
where
any
line
through
meets
the
curve
furthermore
since
the
tangents
at
and
meet
on
this
same
line
it
appears
as
the
locus
of
intersections
of
pairs
of
tangents
drawn
at
the
extremities
of
chords
through
this
important
line
which
is
completely
determined
by
the
point

called
the
of
with
respect
to
the
conic
and
the
point
is
called
the
of
the
line
with
respect
to
the
conic
if
a
point
is
on
the
polar
of
then
it
is
harmonically
conjugate
to
with
respect
to
the
two
intersections
and
of
the
line
with
the
conic
but
for
the
same
reason
is
on
the
polar
of
we
have
then
the
fundamental
theorem
one
point
lies
on
the
polar
of
a
second
then
the
second
lies
on
the
polar
of
the
conjugate
points
and
lines
such
a
pair
of
points
are
said
to
be
with
respect
to
the
conic
similarly
lines
are
said
to
be
to
each
other
with
respect
to
the
conic
if
one
and
consequently
each
passes
through
the
pole

given
a

if
it
is
within
the
conic
that
is
if
no
tangents
may
be
drawn
from
to
the

we
may
construct
its
polar
line
by
drawing
through
it
any
two
chords
and
joining
the
two
points
of
intersection
of
the
two
pairs
of
tangents
at
their
extremities
if
the
point
is
outside

we
may
draw
the

tangents
and
construct

in
fig
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
that
is
a
triangle
that
is
each
vertex
is
the
pole
of
the
opposite
side
for
are
four
harmonic
points
and
they
project
to
in
four
harmonic
rays
the
line
therefore
meets
the
line
in
a
point
on
the
polar
of
being
separated
from
harmonically
by
the
points
and
similarly
the
line
meets
in
a
point
on
the
polar
of

therefore
is
the
polar
of
similarly
is
the
polar
of

therefore
is
the
pole

and
polar
projectively
related
another
very
important
theorem
comes
directly
from
fig
a
point
moves
along
a
straight
line
its
polar
with
respect
to
a
conic
revolves
about
a
fixed
point
and
describes
a
pencil
projective
to
the
described
by
for
fix
the
points
and
and
let
the
point
move
along
the
line
then
the
is
projective
to
the
pencil
and
since
moves
along
the
conic
the
pencil
is
projective
to
the
pencil
which
in
turn
is
projective
to
the
which
finally
is
projective
to
the
pencil
which
is
the
polar
of
duality
we
have
then
in
the
pole
and
polar
relation
a
device
for
setting
up
a
correspondence
between
the
points
and
lines
of
the
correspondence
which
may
be
called
projective
because
to
four
harmonic
points
or
lines
correspond
always
four
harmonic
lines
or
points
to
every
figure
made
up
of
points
and
lines
will
correspond
a
figure
made
up
of
lines
and
points
to
a
of
the
second
order
which
is
a
conic
considered
as
a
corresponds
a
pencil
of
rays
of
the
second
order
which
is
a
conic
considered
as
a
the
name
is
used
to
describe
this
sort
of
correspondence
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
dual
relation
is
subject
to
the
same
exceptions
as
the
correspondence
is
and
must
not
be
appealed
to
in
cases
where
the
correspondence
breaks
down
we
have
seen
that
there
is
in
euclidean
geometry
one
and
only
one
ray
in
a
pencil
which
has
no
point
in
a
perspective
to
it
for
a
corresponding
point
namely
the
line
parallel
to
the
line
of
the
any
theorem
therefore
that
involves
explicitly
the
point
at
infinity
is
not
to
be
translated
into
a
theorem
concerning
lines
further
in
the
pencil
the
angle
between
two
lines
has
nothing
to
correspond
to
it
in
a
perspective
to
the
pencil
any
theorem
therefore
that
mentions
angles
is
not
translatable
into
another
theorem
by
means
of
the
law
of
duality
now
we
have
seen
that
the
notion
of
the
infinitely
distant
point
on
a
line
involves
the
notion
of
dividing
a
segment
into
any
number
of
equal
other
words
of
if
therefore
we
call
any
theorem
that
has
to
do
with
the
line
at
infinity
or
with
the
measurement
of
angles
a
theorem
and
any
other
kind
a
theorem
we
may
put
the
case
as
follows
projective
theorem
involves
another
theorem
dual
to
it
obtainable
by
interchanging
everywhere
the
words
and
theorems
the
theorems
of
this
chapter
will
be
found
upon
examination
to
be
that
is
no
new
theorem
results
from
applying
the
process
indicated
in
the
preceding
paragraph
it
is
therefore
useless
to
look
for
new
results
from
the
theorem
on
the
circumscribed
quadrilateral
derived
from
which
is
itself
clearly
the
dual
of
theorem
and
in
fact
was
first
discovered
by
dualization
of
it
should
not
be
inferred
from
the
above
discussion
that
correspondences
may
not
be
devised
that
will
control
certain
of
the
metrical
relations
a
very
important
one
may
be
easily
found
that
leaves
angles
unaltered
the
relation
called

ratios
between
corresponding

unaltered

be

shown

it
is
clear
that
we
might
have
deemed
six
rays
in
involution
as
six
rays
which
pass
through
a
point
and
also
through
six
points
in
involution
while
this
would
have
been
entirely
in
accord
with
the
treatment
which
was
given
the
corresponding
problem
in
the
theory
of
harmonic
points
and
lines
it
is
more
satisfactory
from
an
aesthetic
point
of
view
to
build
the
theory
of
lines
in
involution
on
its
own
base
the
student
can
show
by
methods
entirely
analogous
to
those
used
in
the
second
chapter
that
involution
is
a
projective
property
that
is
six
rays
in
involution
are
cut
by
any
transversal
in
six
points
in
involution
pencils
of
rays
of
the
second
order
in
involution
we
may
also
extend
the
notion
of
involution
to
pencils
of
rays
of
the
second
order
thus
tangents
to
a
conic
are
in
involution
when
they
are
corresponding
rays
of
two
protective
pencils
of
the
second
order
superposed
upon
the
same
conic
and
when
they
correspond
to
each
other
we
have
then
the
theorem
intersections
of
corresponding
rays
of
a
pencil
of
the
second
order
in
involution
are
all
on
a
straight
line
and
the
intersection
of
any
two
tangents
when
joined
to
the
intersection
of
the
corresponding
tangents
gives
a
line
which
passes
through
a
fixed
point
the
pole
of
the
line
with
respect
to
the
involution
of
rays
determined
by
a
conic
we
have
seen
in
the
theory
of
poles
and
polars
that
if
a
point
moves
along
a
line
then
the
polar
of
revolves
about
a
point
this
pencil
cuts
out
on
another
projective
also
to
since
the
polar
of
passes
through
the
polar
of
also
passes
through
so
that
the
correspondence
between
and
is
double
the
two
are
therefore
in
involution
and
the
double
points
if
any
exist
are
the
points
where
the
line
meets
the
conic
a
similar
involution
of
rays
may
be
found
at
any
point
in
the
plane
corresponding
rays
passing
each
through
the
pole
of
the
other
we
have
called
such
points
and
rays
with
respect
to
the
conic
we
may
then
state
the
following
important
theorem
conic
determines
on
every
line
in
its
plane
an
involution
of
points
corresponding
points
in
the
involution

connect
the
projective
theory
of
involution
with
the
metrical
as
usual
by
the
introduction
of
the
elements
at
infinity
in
an
involution
of
points
on
a
line
the
point
which
corresponds
to
the
infinitely
distant
point
is
called
the
of
the
involution
since
corresponding
points
in
the
involution
have
been
shown
to
be
harmonic

with
respect
to
the
double
points
the
center
is

between
the
double
points
when
they
exist

we
draw
as
usual
through
and
any
two

and
cut
them
by
a
line
parallel
to
in
the
points
and
join
these
points
to
and
thus
determining
on
and
the
points
and
meets
in
the
center
of
the
involution
fundamental
metrical
theorem
from
the
figure
we
see
that
the
triangles
and
are
similar
being
the
intersection
of
km
and
ln
also
the
triangles
and
are
similar
we
thus
have
pk

and
pm
ol

whence
pk
pm

pn
in
the

way
from
the
similar
triangles
and
and
also
and
we
obtain
pk
pm
on
ol
pn
pl
and
this
with
the
preceding
gives
at
once
the
fundamental
theorem
which
is
sometimes
taken
also
as
the
definition
of
involution
ob
or
in
words
product
of
the
distances
from
the
center
to
two
corresponding
points
in
an
involution
of
points
is
existence
of
double
points
clearly
according
as
the
constant
is
positive
or
negative
the
involution
will
or
will
not
have
double
points
the
constant
is
the
square
root
of
the
distance
from
the
center
to
the
double
points
if
and
lie
both
on
the
same
side
of
the
center
the
product
is
positive
and
if
they
lie
on
opposite
sides
it
is
negative
take
the
case
where
they
both
lie
on
the
same
side
of
the
center
and
take
also
the
pair
of
corresponding
points
then
since
ob
it
can
not
happen
that
and
are
separated
from
each
other
by
and
this
is
evident
enough
if
the
points
are
on
opposite
sides
of
the
center
if
the
pairs
are
on
the
same
side
of
the
center
and
lies
between
and
so
that
is
greater
say
than
but
less
than
then
by
the
equation
ob
we
must
have
also
less
than
and
greater
than
a
similar
discussion
may
be
made
for
the
case
where
and
lie
on
opposite
sides
of
the
results
may
be
stated
as
follows
without
any
reference
to
the
center
two
pairs
of
points
in
an
involution
of
points
if
the
points
of
one
pair
are
separated
from
each
other
by
the
points
of
the
other
pair
then
the
involution
has
no
double
points
if
the
points
of
one
pair
are
not
separated
from
each
other
by
the
points
of
the
other
pair
then
the
involution
has
two
double
an
entirely
similar
criterion
decides
whether
an
involution

way
in
which

an
involution

may
be
constructed

exist

from

lay

elementary
geometry
we
have
one
double
point

is
at
an
equal
distance
on
the
other
side
of
this
simple
and
effective
method
of
constructing
an
involution
of
points
is
often
taken
as
the
basis
for
the
theory
of
involution
in
projective
geometry
however
the
circle
which
is
not
a
figure
that
remains
unaltered
by
projection
and
is
essentially
a
metrical
notion
ought
not
to
be
used
to
build
up
the
purely
projective
part
of
the
theory
it
ought
to
be
mentioned
that
the
theory
of
analytic
geometry
indicates
that
the
circle
is
a
special
conic

that
happens
to
pass
through

points

the

method
of
obtaining
a
in
involution
is
then
nothing
but
a
special
case
of
the
general
theorem
of
the
last
chapter
which
asserted
that

of

through
four

will
cut

in
an
involution
of

there
is
no
one
ray
which
may
be
distinguished
from
all
the
others
as
the
point
at
infinity
is
distinguished
from
all
other
points
on
a
line
there
is
one
pair
of
rays
however
which
does
differ
from
all
the
others
in
that
for
this
particular
pair
the
angle
is
a
right
angle
this
is
most
easily
shown
by
using
the
construction
that
employs
circles
as
indicated
above
the
centers
of
all
the
circles

and
lie
on
the

and
draw
the
circle
with

goes

this

cuts
out
two
points
and
in
the
involution
the
rays

are
clearly
at
right
angles

inscribed
in
a
semicircle

therefore
the
involution

points
is
projected

we
have
found
two
corresponding
rays
which
are
at
right
angles
to
each
other
given
now
any
involution
of
rays
with
center
we
may
cut
across
it
by
a
straight
line
and
proceed
to
find
the
two
points
and
clearly
there
will
be
only
one
such
pair
unless
the
perpendicular
bisector
of
coincides
with
the
line
in
this
case
every
ray
is
at
right
angles
to
its
corresponding
ray
and
the
involution
is
called
axes
of
conics
at
the
close
of
the
last
chapter
we
gave
the
theorem
conic
determines
at
every
point
in
its
plane
an
involution
of
rays
corresponding
rays
being
conjugate
with
respect
to
the
conic
the
double
rays
if
any
exist
are
the
tangents
from
the
point
to
the
in
particular
taking
the
point
as
the
center
of
the
conic
we
find
that
conjugate
diameters
form
a
system
of
rays
in
involution
of
which
the
asymptotes
if
there
are
any
are
the
double
rays
also
conjugate
diameters
are
harmonic
conjugates
with
respect
to
the
asymptotes
by
the
theorem
of
the
last
paragraph
there
are
two
conjugate
diameters
which
are
at
right
angles
to
each
other
these
are
called
axes
in
the
case
of
the
parabola
where
the
center
is
at
infinity
and
on
the
curve
there
are
properly
speaking
no
conjugate
diameters
while
the
line
at
infinity
might
be
considered
as
conjugate
to
all
the
other
diameters
it
is
not
possible
to
assign
to
it
any
particular
direction
and
so
it
can
not
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
defining
an
axis
of
a
parabola
there
is
one
diameter
however
which
is
at
right
angles
to
its
conjugate
system
of
chords
and
this
one
is
called
the
of
the
parabola
the
circle
also
furnishes
an
exception
in
that
every
diameter
is
an
axis
the
involution
in
this
case
is
circular
every
ray
being
at
right
angles
to
its
conjugate
ray
at
the
center
points
at
which
the
involution
determined
by
a
conic
is
circular
it
is
an
important
problem
to
discover
whether
for
any
conic
other
than
the
circle
it
is
possible
to
find
any
point
in
the
plane
where
the
involution
determined
as
above
by
the
conic
is
circular
we
shall
proceed
to
the
curious
problem
of
proving
the
existence
of
such
points
and
of
determining
their
number
and
situation
we
shall
then
develop
the
important
properties
of
such
points
it
is
clear
in
the
first
place
that
such
a
point
can
not
be
on
the
outside
of
the
conic
else
the
involution
would
have
double
rays
and
such
rays
would
have
to
be
at
right
angles
to
themselves
in
the
second
place
if
two
such
points
exist
the
line
joining
them
must
be
a
diameter
and
indeed
an
axis
for
if
and
were
two
such
points
then
since
the
conjugate
ray
at
to
the
line
must
be
at
right
angles
to
it
and
also
since
the
conjugate
ray
at
to
the
line
must
be
at
right
angles
to
it
the
pole
of
must
be
at
infinity
in
a
direction
at
right
angles
to
the
line
is
then
a
diameter
and
since
it
is
at
right
angles
to
its
conjugate
diameter
it
must
be
an
axis
from
this
it
follows
also
that
the
points
we
are
seeking
must
all
lie
on
one
of
the
two
axes
else
we
should
have
a
diameter
which
does
not
go
through
the
intersection
of
all
center
of
the
conic
at
least
one
axis
therefore
must
be
free
from
any
such
points
figure

let
now
be
a
point
on
one
of
the
axes

and
draw
any
ray
through
it

as
as
revolves
about
its
pole
moves
along
a
line
at
right
angles

lies
on

as
is
seen
by
taking
at
right
angles
to
the
axis
on
which
lies
the
center
of
this
pencil
may
be
called
and
thus
we
have
paired
the
point
with
the
point
by
moving
the
point
along
the
axis
and
by
keeping
the
ray
parallel
to
a
fixed
direction
we
may
see
that
the
and
the
are
projective
also
the
correspondence
is
double
and
by
starting
from
the
point
we
arrive
at
the
point
therefore
the
and
are
in
involution
and
if
only
the
involution
has
double
points
we
shall
have
found
in
them
the
points
we
are
seeking
for
it
is
clear
that
the
rays
through
and
the
corresponding
rays
through
are
conjugate
normals
and
if
and
coincide
we
shall
have
a
point
where
all
rays
are
at
right
angles
to
their
conjugates
we
shall
now
show
that
the
involution
thus
obtained
on
one
of
the
two
axes
must
have
double
points

of
the

of

we
know
that
on
one
axis
no
such
points
as
we
are
seeking
can
lie
the
involution
of
points
on
this
axis
can
therefore
have
no
double
points
nevertheless
let
and
be
two
pairs
of

on

then
we
know
that

are
separated
from
each

by

draw
a
circle
on
as
a

and
one
on
as
a

these
must
intersect
in
two
points
and
and
since
the
center
of
the
conic
is
the
center
of
the
involution
as
is
easily
seen
it
follows
that
and
are
on
the
other
axis
of
the
conic
moreover
and
are
conjugate
normal
rays
since

inscribed
in
a
semicircle
and
the
two

go
one
through
and
the
other
through
the
involution

points
therefore
projects
to
the
two
points

in
two
pencils
of
rays
in
involution
which
have
for
corresponding
rays
conjugate
normals
to
the
conic
we
may
then
say
are
two
and
only
two
points
of
the
plane
where
the
involution
determined
by
the
conic
is
circular
these
two
points
lie
on
one
of
the
axes
at
equal
distances
from
the

the
inside

the
above
discussion
applies
only
to
the
central
conics
apart
from
the
circle
in
the

the
two
foci
fall
together
at
the
center
in
the
case
of
the
parabola
that
part
of
the
investigation
which
proves
the
existence
of
two
foci
on
one
of
the
axes
will
not
hold
as
we
have
but
one
axis
it
is
seen
however
that
as
moves
to
infinity
carrying
the
line
with
it
becomes
the
line
at
infinity
which
for
the
parabola
is
a
tangent
line
its
pole
is
thus
at
infinity
and
also
the
point
so
that
and
fall
together
at

therefore
one
focus
of
the

is
at

there
must
therefore
be

therefore
harmonic

the

of
synthetic

ancient
results
the
theory
of
synthetic
projective
geometry
as
we
have
built
it
up
in
this
course
is
less
than
a
century
old
this
is
not
to
say
that
many
of
the
theorems
and
principles
involved
were
not
discovered
much
earlier
but
isolated
theorems
do
not
make
a
theory
any
more
than
a
pile
of
bricks
makes
a
building
the
materials
for
our
building
have
been
contributed
by
many
different
workmen
from
the
days
of
euclid
down
to
the
present
time
thus
the
notion
of
four
harmonic
points
was
familiar
to
the
ancients
who
considered
it
from
the
metrical
point
of
view
as
the
division
of
a
line
internally
and
externally
in
the
same
ratio
the
involution
of
six
points
cut
out
by
any
transversal
which
intersects
the
sides
of
a
complete
quadrilateral
as
studied
by
pappus
but
these
notions
were
not
made
the
foundation
for
any
general
theory
taken
by
themselves
they
are
of
small
consequence
it
is
their
relation
to
other
theorems
and
sets
of
theorems
that
gives
them
their
importance
the
ancients
were
doubtless
familiar
with
the
theorem

a

a

they
had
no
glimpse
of
the
wonderful
law
of
duality
of
which
this
theorem
is
a
simple
example
the
principle
of
projection
by
which
many
properties
of
the
conic
sections
may
be
inferred
from
corresponding
properties
of
the
circle
which
forms
the
base
of
the

from
which
they
are

so
natural
to
modern
not
to
have
occurred
to
the
greeks
the
ellipse
the
hyperbola
and
the
parabola
were
to
them
entirely
different
curves
to
be
treated
separately
with
methods
appropriate
to
each
thus
the
focus
of
the
ellipse
was
discovered
some
five
hundred
years
before
the
focus
of
the
parabola
it
was
not
till
that
verner
of

undertook
to
demonstrate
the
properties
of
the
conic
sections
by

of
the

connecting
the
great
mass
of
material
dug
out
by
the

thus
in
the
great
astronomer
kepler
introduced
the
notion
that
parallel
lines
should
be
considered
as
meeting
at
an
infinite
distance
and
that
a
parabola
is
at
once
the
limiting
case
of
an
ellipse
and
of
a
hyperbola
he
also
attributes
to
the
parabola
a
blind
focus
at

on
the

desargues
in
desargues
an
architect
of
lyons
published
a
little
treatise
on
the
conic
sections
in
which
appears
the
theorem
upon
which
we
have
founded
the
theory
of
four
harmonic
points
desargues
however
does
not
make
use
of
it
for
that
purpose
four
harmonic
points
are
for
him
a
special
case
of
six
points
in
involution
when
two
of
the
three
pairs
coincide
giving
double
points
his
development
of
the
theory
of
involution
is
also
different
from
the
purely
geometric
one
which
we
have
adopted
and
is
based
on
the
theorem
that
the
product
of
the
distances
of
two
conjugate
points
from
the
center
is
constant
he
also
proves
the
projective
character
of
an
involution
of
points
by
showing
that
when
six
lines
pass
through
a
point
and
through
six
points
in
involution
then
any
transversal
must
meet
them
in
six
points
which
are
also
in
involution
poles
and
polars
in
this
little
treatise
is
also
contained
the
theory
of
poles
and
polars
the
polar
line
is
called
a
the
harmonic
properties
of
poles
and
polars
are
given
but
desargues
seems
not
to
have
arrived
at
the
metrical
properties
which
result
when
the
infinite
elements
of
the

are
introduced
thus
he
says
when
the
is

an

is
unimaginable
theorem
concerning
conics
through
four
points
we
find
in
this
little
book
the
beautiful
theorem
concerning
a
quadrilateral
inscribed
in
a
conic
section
which
is
given
by
his
name
in
the
theorem
is
not
given
in
terms
of
a
system
of
conics
through
four
points
for
desargues
had
no
conception
of
any
such
system
he
states
the
theorem
in
effect
as
follows
a
simple
quadrilateral
inscribed
in
a
conic
section
every
transversal
meets
the
conic
and
the
four
sides
of
the
quadrilateral
in
six
points
which
are
in
extension
of
the
theory
of
poles
and
polars
to
space
as
an
illustration
of
his
remarkable
powers
of
generalization
we
may
note
that
desargues
extended
the
notion
of
poles
and
polars
to
space
of
three
dimensions
for
the
sphere
and
for
certain
other
surfaces
of
the
second
degree
this
is
a
matter
which
has
not
been
touched
on
in
this
book
but
the
notion
is
not
difficult
to
grasp
if
we
draw
through
any
point
in
space
a
line
to
cut
a
sphere
in
two
points
and
and
then
construct
the
fourth
harmonic
of
with
respect
to
and
the
locus
of
this
fourth
harmonic
for
various
lines
through
is
a
plane
called
the
of
with
respect
to
the
sphere
with
this
definition
and
theorem
one
can
easily
find
dual
relations
between
points
and
planes
in
space
analogous
to
those
between
points
and
lines
in
a
plane
desargues
closes
his
discussion
of
this
matter
with
the
remark
similar
properties
may
be
found
for
those
other
solids
which
are
related
to
the
sphere
in
the
same
way
that
the
conic
section
is
to
the
circle
it
should
not
be
inferred
from
this
remark
however
that
he
was
acquainted
with
all
the
different
varieties
of
surfaces
of
the
second
order
the
ancients
were
well
acquainted
with
the
surfaces
obtained
by
revolving
an
ellipse
or
a
parabola
about
an
axis
even
the
hyperboloid
of
two
sheets
obtained
by
revolving
the
hyperbola
about
its
major
axis
was
known
to
them
but
probably
not
the
hyperboloid
of
one
sheet
which
results
from
revolving
a
hyperbola
about
the
other
axis
all
the
other
solids
of
the
second
degree
were
probably
unknown
until
their
discovery
by
euler
desargues
had
no
conception
of
the
conic
section
of
the
locus
of
intersection
of
corresponding
rays
of
two
projective
pencils
of

seems
to
have
tried
to
describe
the

means
of
a
pair
of
compasses
moving
one
leg
back
and
forth
along
a
straight
line

holding
it

reception
of
work
strange
to
say
immortal

was
heaped
with
the
most
violent
abuse
and
held
up
to
ridicule
and

incredible
errors
enormous
mistakes
and

really
it

impossible
for
anyone
who
is
familiar
with
the
science
concerning
which
he
wishes
to
retail
his
thoughts
to
keep
from

such
were
the
comments
of
reviewers
and
critics
nor
were
his
detractors
altogether
ignorant
and
uninstructed
men
in
spite
of
the
devotion
of

and
in

of
the
admiration
and

of

like
descartes
fermat
mersenne
and
roberval
his
book
disappeared
so
completely
that
two
centuries
after
the
date
of
its
publication
when
the
french
geometer
chasles
wrote
his
history
of
geometry
there
was
no
means
of
estimating
the
value
of
the
work
done
by
desargues
six
years
later
however
in
chasles
found
a
manuscript
copy
of
the
made
by
pupil
de
la
hire
conservatism
in
time
it
is
not
necessary
to
suppose
that
this
effacement
of
work
for
two
centuries
was
due
to
the
savage
attacks
of
his
critics
all
this
was
in
accordance
with
the
fashion
of
the
time
and
no
man
escaped
bitter
denunciation
who
attempted
to
improve
on
the
methods
of
the
ancients
those
were
days
when
men
refused
to
believe
that
a
heavy
body
falls
at
the
same
rate
as
a
lighter
one
even
when
galileo
made
them
see
it
with
their
own
eyes
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
of
pisa
could
they
not
turn
to
the
exact
page
and
line
of
aristotle
which
declared
that
the
heavier
body
must
fall
the
faster
i
have
read
writings
from
end
to
end
many
times
wrote
a
jesuit
provincial
to
the
mathematician
and
astronomer
christoph
scheiner
at
ingolstadt
whose
telescope
seemed
to
reveal
certain
mysterious
spots
on
the
sun
and
i
can
assure
you
i
have
nowhere
found
anything
similar
to
what
you
describe
go
my
son
and
tranquilize
yourself
be
assured
that
what
you
take
for
spots
on
the
sun
are
the
faults
of
your
glasses
or
of
your
eyes
the
dead
hand
of
aristotle
barred
the
advance
in
every
department
of
research
physicians
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
discoveries
about
the
circulation
of
the
blood
nature
is
accused
of
tolerating
a
vacuum
exclaimed
a
priest
when
pascal
began
his
experiments
on
the
to
show
that
the
column
of
mercury
in
a
glass
tube
varied
in
height
with
the
pressure
of
the
atmosphere
style
of
writing
nevertheless
authority
counted
for
less
at
this
time
in
paris
than
it
did
in
italy
and
the
tragedy
enacted
in
rome
when
galileo
was
forced
to
deny
his
inmost
convictions
at
the
bidding
of
a
brutal
inquisition
could
not
have
been
staged
in
france
moreover
in
the
little
company
of
scientists
of
which
desargues
was
a
member
the
utmost
liberty
of
thought
and
expression
was
maintained
one
very
good
reason
for
the
disappearance
of
the
work
of
desargues
is
to
be
found
in
his
style
of
writing
he
failed
to
heed
the
very
good
advice
given
him
in
a
letter
from
his
warm
admirer
descartes
you
may
have
two
designs
both
very
good
and
very
laudable
but
which
do
not
require
the
same
method
of
procedure
the
one
is
to
write
for
the
learned
and
show
them
some
new
properties
of
the
conic
sections
which
they
do
not
already
know
and
the
other
is
to
write
for
the
curious
unlearned
and
to
do
it
so
that
this
matter
which
until
now
has
been
understood
by
only
a
very
few
and
which
is
nevertheless
very
useful
for
perspective
for
painting
architecture
shall
become
common
and
easy
to
all
who
wish
to
study
them
in
your
book
if
you
have
the
first
idea
then
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
necessary
to
avoid
using
new
terms
for
the
learned
are
already
accustomed
to
using
those
of
apollonius
and
will
not
readily
change
them
for
others
though
better
and
thus
yours
will
serve
only
to
render
your
demonstrations
more
difficult
and
to
turn
away
your
readers
from
your
book
if
you
have
the
second
plan
in
mind
it
is
certain
that
your
terms
which
are
french
and
conceived
with
spirit
and
grace
will
be
better
received
by
persons
not
preoccupied
with
those
of
the
ancients
but
if
you
have
that
intention
you
should
make
of
it
a
great
volume
explain
it
all
so
fully
and
so
distinctly
that
those
gentlemen
who
can
not
study
without
yawning
who
can
not
distress
their
imaginations
enough
to
grasp
a
proposition
in
geometry
nor
turn
the
leaves
of
a
book
to
look
at
the
letters
in
a
figure
shall
find
nothing
in
your
discourse
more
difficult
to
understand
than
the
description
of
an
enchanted
palace
in
a
fairy
story
the
point
of
these
remarks
is
apparent
when
we
note
that
desargues
introduced
some
seventy
new
terms
in
his
little
book
of
which
only
one
has
survived
curiously
enough
this
is
the
one
term
singled
out
for
the
sharpest
criticism
and
ridicule
by
his
reviewer
de
beaugrand
that
descartes
knew
the
character
of
audience
better
than
he
did
is
also
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
de
beaugrand
exhausted
his
patience
in
reading
the
first
ten
pages
of
the
book
lack
of
appreciation
of
desargues
methods
entirely
different
from
the
analytic
methods
just
then
being
developed
by
descartes
and
fermat
seem
to
have
been
little
understood
between
you
and
me
wrote
descartes
to
mersenne
i
can
hardly
form
an
idea
of
what
he
may
have
written
concerning
conics
desargues
seems
to
have
boasted
that
he
owed
nothing
to
any
man
and
that
all
his
results
had
come
from
his
own
mind
his
favorite
pupil
de
la
hire
did
not
realize
the
extraordinary
simplicity
and
generality
of
his
work
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
the
only
one
of
all
his
associates
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
methods
of
desargues
should
be
a
lad
of
sixteen
years
pascal
and
his
theorem
one
does
not
have
to
believe
all
the
marvelous
stories
of
admiring
sisters
to
credit
him
with
wonderful
precocity
we
have
the
fact
that
in
when
he
was
sixteen
years
old
he
published
a
little
placard
or
poster
entitled
essay
pour
les
conique
in
which
his
great
theorem
appears
for
the
first
time
his
manner
of
putting
it
may
be
a
little
puzzling
to
one
who
has
only
seen
it
in
the
form
given
in
this
book
and
it
may
be
worth
while
for
the
student
to
compare
the
two
methods
of
stating
it
it
is
given
as
follows
if
in
the
plane
of
we
draw
through
the
two
lines
and
and
through
the
point
the
two
lines
and
and
let
be
the
intersection
of
and
the
intersection
of
and
the
intersection
of
and
is
the
intersection
of
and
and
the
intersection
of
and
and
if
through
two
of
the
four
points
which
are
not
in
the
same
straight
line
with
and
such
as
and
we
pass
the
circumference
of
a
circle
cutting
the
lines
in
the
points
i
say
that
the
lines
are
of
the
same
order
by
lines
of
the
same
order
pascal
means
lines
which
meet
in
the
same
point
or
are
parallel
by
projecting
the
figure
thus
described
upon
another
plane
he
is
able
to
state
his
theorem
for
the
case
where
the
circle
is
replaced
by
any
conic
section
it
must
be
understood
that
the
essay
was
only
a
résumé
of
a
more
extended
treatise
on
conics
which
owing
partly
to
extreme
youth
partly
to
the
difficulty
of
publishing
scientific
works
in
those
days
and
also
to
his
later
morbid
interest
in
religious
matters
was
never
published
leibniz
examined
a
copy
of
the
complete
work
and
has
reported
that
the
great
theorem
on
the
mystic
hexagram
was
made
the
basis
of
the
whole
theory
and
that
pascal
had
deduced
some
four
hundred
corollaries
from
it
this
would
indicate
that
here
was
a
man
able
to
take
the
unconnected
materials
of
projective
geometry
and
shape
them
into
some
such
symmetrical
edifice
as
we
have
unfortunately
for
science
early
death
prevented
the
further
development
of
the
subject
at
his
hands
in
the
essay
pascal
gives
full
credit
to
desargues
saying
of
one
of
the
other
propositions
we
prove
this
property
also
the
original
discoverer
of
which
is
desargues
of
lyons
one
of
the
greatest
minds
of
this
age
and
i
wish
to
acknowledge
that
i
owe
to
him
the
little
which
i
have
discovered
this
acknowledgment
led
descartes
to
believe
that
theorem
should
also
be
credited
to
desargues
but
in
the
scientific
club
which
the
young
pascal
attended
in
company
with
his
father
who
was
also
a
scientist
of
some
reputation
the
theorem
went
by
the
name
of
pascalia
and
remarks
do
not
seem
to
have
been
taken
seriously
which
indeed
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
seeing
that
he
was
in
the
habit
of
giving
scant
credit
to
the
work
of
other
scientific
investigators
than
himself
de
la
hire
and
his
work
de
la
hire
added
little
to
the
development
of
the
subject
but
he
did
put
into
print
much
of
what
desargues
had
already
worked
out
not
fully
realizing
perhaps
how
much
was
his
own
and
how
much
he
owed
to
his
teacher
writing
in
he
says
i
have
just
read
for
the
first
time
little
treatise
and
have
made
a
copy
of
it
in
order
to
have
a
more
perfect
knowledge
of
it
it
was
this
copy
that
saved
the
work
of
his
master
from
oblivion
de
la
hire
should
be
credited
among
other
things
with
the
invention
of
a
method
by
which
figures
in
the
plane
may
be
transformed
into
others
of
the
same
order
his
method
is
extremely
interesting
and
will
serve
as
an
exercise
for
the
student
in
synthetic
projective
geometry
it
is
as
follows
two
parallel
lines
and
and
select
a
point
in
their
plane
through
any
point
of
the
plane
draw
a
line
meeting
in
and
in
draw
a
line
through
parallel
to
and
let
it
meet
in
the
point
it
may
be
shown
that
the
point
thus
obtained
does
not
depend
at
all
on
the
particular
ray
used
in
determining
it
so
that
we
have
set
up
a
correspondence
between
the
points
and
in
the
the
student
may
show
that
as
describes
a
describes
a
projective
to
it
as
describes
a
conic
describes
another
conic
this
sort
of
correspondence
is
called
a
it
will
be
found
that
the
points
on
the
line
transform
into
themselves
as
does
also
the
single
point
points
on
the
line
transform
into
points
on
the
line
at
infinity
the
student
should
remove
the
metrical
features
of
the
construction
and
take
instead
of
two
parallel
lines
and
any
two
lines
which
may
meet
in
a
finite
part
of
the
plane
the
collineation
is
a
special
one
in
that
the
general
one
has
an
invariant
triangle
instead
of
an
invariant
point
and
line
descartes
and
his
influence
the
history
of
synthetic
projective
geometry
has
little
to
do
with
the
work
of
the
great
philosopher
descartes
except
in
an
indirect
way
the
method
of
algebraic
analysis
invented
by
him
and
the
differential
and
integral
calculus
which
developed
from
it
attracted
all
the
interest
of
the
mathematical
world
for
nearly
two
centuries
after
desargues
and
synthetic
geometry
received
scant
attention
during
the
rest
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
for
the
greater
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
is
difficult
for
moderns
to
conceive
of
the
richness
and
variety
of
the
problems
which
confronted
the
first
workers
in
the
calculus
to
come
into
the
possession
of
a
method
which
would
solve
almost
automatically
problems
which
had
baffled
the
keenest
minds
of
antiquity
to
be
able
to
derive
in
a
few
moments
results
which
an
archimedes
had
toiled
long
and
patiently
to
reach
or
a
galileo
had
determined
experimentally
such
was
the
happy
experience
of
mathematicians
for
a
century
and
a
half
after
descartes
and
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
along
with
this
enthusiastic
pursuit
of
new
theorems
in
analysis
should
come
a
species
of
contempt
for
the
methods
of
the
ancients
so
that
in
his
preface
to
his
méchanique
analytique
published
in
lagrange
boasts
one
will
find
no
figures
in
this
work
but
at
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
field
opened
up
to
research
by
the
invention
of
the
calculus
began
to
appear
so
thoroughly
explored
that
new
methods
and
new
objects
of
investigation
began
to
attract
attention
lagrange
himself
in
his
later
years
turned
in
weariness
from
analysis
and
mechanics
and
applied
himself
to
chemistry
physics
and
philosophical
speculations
this
state
of
mind
says
darboux
we
find
almost
always
at
certain
moments
in
the
lives
of
the
greatest
scholars
at
any
rate
after
lying
fallow
for
almost
two
centuries
the
field
of
pure
geometry
was
attacked
with
almost
religious
enthusiasm
newton
and
maclaurin
but
in
hastening
on
to
the
epoch
of
poncelet
and
steiner
we
should
not
omit
to
mention
the
work
of
newton
and
maclaurin
although
their
results
were
obtained
by
analysis
for
the
most
part
nevertheless
they
have
given
us
theorems
which
fall
naturally
into
the
domain
of
synthetic
projective
geometry
thus
organic
method
of
generating
conic
sections
is
closely
related
to
the
method
which
we
have
made
use
of
in
chapter
iii
it
is
as
follows
two
angles
and
of
given
magnitudes
turn
about
their
respective
vertices
and
in
such
a
way
that
the
point
of
intersection
of
one
pair
of
arms
always
lies
on
a
straight
line
the
point
of
intersection
of
the
other
pair
of
arms
will
describe
a
the
proof
of
this
is
left
to
the
student
another
method
of
generating
a
conic
is
due
to
maclaurin
the
construction
which
we
also
leave
for
the
student
to
justify
is
as
follows
a
triangle
move
in
such
a
way
that
its
sides
and
turn
around
three
fixed
points
respectively
while
two
of
its
vertices
slide
along
two
fixed
lines
and
respectively
then
the
remaining
vertex
will
describe
a
descriptive
geometry
and
the
second
revival
the
second
revival
of
pure
geometry
was
again
to
take
place
at
a
time
of
great
intellectual
activity
the
period
at
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
and
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
is
adorned
with
a
glorious
list
of
mighty
names
among
which
are
gauss
lagrange
legendre
laplace
monge
carnot
poncelet
cauchy
fourier
steiner
von
staudt
möbius
abel
and
many
others
the
renaissance
may
be
said
to
date
from
the
invention
by
monge
of
the
theory
of
descriptive
geometry
is
concerned
with
the
representation
of
figures
in
space
of
three
dimensions
by
means
of
space
of
two
dimensions
the
method
commonly
used
consists
in
projecting
the
space
figure
on
two
planes
a
vertical
and
a
horizontal
plane
being
most
convenient
the
projections
being
made
most
simply
for
metrical
purposes
from
infinity
in
directions
perpendicular
to
the
two
planes
of
projection
these
two
planes
are
then
made
to
coincide
by
revolving
the
horizontal
into
the
vertical
about
their
common
line
such
is
the
method
of
descriptive
geometry
which
in
the
hands
of
monge
acquired
wonderful
generality
and
elegance
problems
concerning
fortifications
were
worked
so
quickly
by
this
method
that
the
commandant
at
the
military
school
at
mézières
where
monge
was
a
draftsman
and
pupil
viewed
the
results
with
distrust
monge
afterward
became
professor
of
mathematics
at
mézières
and
gathered
around
him
a
group
of
students
destined
to
have
a
share
in
the
advancement
of
pure
geometry
among
these
were
hachette
brianchon
dupin
chasles
poncelet
and
many
others
duality
homology
continuity
contingent
relations
analytic
geometry
had
left
little
to
do
in
the
way
of
discovery
of
new
material
and
the
mathematical
world
was
ready
for
the
construction
of
the
edifice
the
activities
of
the
group
of
men
that
followed
monge
were
directed
toward
this
end
and
we
now
begin
to
hear
of
the
great
unifying
notions
of
duality
homology
continuity
contingent
relations
and
the
like
the
devotees
of
pure
geometry
were
beginning
to
feel
the
need
of
a
basis
for
their
science
which
should
be
at
once
as
general
and
as
rigorous
as
that
of
the
analysts
their
dream
was
the
building
up
of
a
system
of
geometry
which
should
be
independent
of
analysis
monge
and
after
him
poncelet
spent
much
thought
on
the
principle
of
continuity
afterwards
discussed
by
chasles
under
the
name
of
the
principle
of
contingent
relations
to
get
a
clear
idea
of
this
principle
consider
a
theorem
in
geometry
in
the
proof
of
which
certain
auxiliary
elements
are
employed
these
elements
do
not
appear
in
the
statement
of
the
theorem
and
the
theorem
might
possibly
be
proved
without
them
in
drawing
the
figure
for
the
proof
of
the
theorem
however
some
of
these
elements
may
not
appear
or
as
the
analyst
would
say
they
become
imaginary
no
matter
says
the
principle
of
contingent
relations
the
theorem
is
true
and
the
proof
is
valid
whether
the
elements
used
in
the
proof
are
real
or
imaginary
poncelet
and
cauchy
the
efforts
of
poncelet
to
compel
the
acceptance
of
this
principle
independent
of
analysis
resulted
in
a
bitter
and
perhaps
fruitless
controversy
between
him
and
the
great
analyst
cauchy
in
his
review
of
great
work
on
the
projective
properties
of
figures
cauchy
says
in
his
preliminary
discourse
the
author
insists
once
more
on
the
necessity
of
admitting
into
geometry
what
he
calls
the
of
we
have
already
discussed
that
principle
and
we
have
found
that
that
principle
is
properly
speaking
only
a
strong
induction
which
can
not
be
indiscriminately
applied
to
all
sorts
of
questions
in
geometry
nor
even
in
analysis
the
reasons
which
we
have
given
as
the
basis
of
our
opinion
are
not
affected
by
the
considerations
which
the
author
has
developed
in
his
traité
des
propriétés
projectives
des
figures
although
this
principle
is
constantly
made
use
of
at
the
present
day
in
all
sorts
of
investigations
careful
geometricians
are
in
agreement
with
cauchy
in
this
matter
and
use
it
only
as
a
convenient
working
tool
for
purposes
of
exploration
the
correspondence
between
geometric
forms
and
algebraic
analysis
is
subject
to
many
and
important
exceptions
the
field
of
analysis
is
much
more
general
than
the
field
of
geometry
and
while
there
may
be
a
clear
notion
in
analysis
to
correspond
to
every
notion
in
geometry
the
opposite
is
not
true
thus
in
analysis
we
can
deal
with
four
coördinates
as
well
as
with
three
but
the
existence
of
a
space
of
four
dimensions
to
correspond
to
it
does
not
therefore
follow
when
the
geometer
speaks
of
the
two
real
or
imaginary
intersections
of
a
straight
line
with
a
conic
he
is
really
speaking
the
language
of
algebra
from
the
algebra
it
is
the
height
of
absurdity
to
try
to
distinguish
between
the
two
points
in
which
a
line
to
meet
a
conic
the
work
of
poncelet
but
right
to
the
title
the
father
of
modern
geometry
does
not
stand
or
fall
with
the
principle
of
contingent
relations
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
considered
this
principle
the
most
important
of
all
his
discoveries
his
reputation
rests
on
more
solid
foundations
he
was
the
first
to
study
figures
which
is
in
effect
the
collineation
described
in
where
corresponding
points
lie
on
straight
lines
through
a
fixed
point
he
was
the
first
to
give
by
means
of
the
theory
of
poles
and
polars
a
transformation
by
which
an
element
is
transformed
into
another
of
a
different
sort
transformations
will
sometimes
generalize
a
theorem
but
the
transformation
discovered
by
poncelet
may
throw
a
theorem
into
one
of
an
entirely
different
aspect
the
principle
of
duality
first
stated
in
definite
form
by
gergonne
the
editor
of
the
mathematical
journal
in
which
poncelet
published
his
researches
was
based
by
poncelet
on
his
theory
of
poles
and
polars
he
also
put
into
definite
form
the
notions
of
the
infinitely
distant
elements
in
space
as
all
lying
on
a
plane
at
infinity
the
debt
which
analytic
geometry
owes
to
synthetic
geometry
the
reaction
of
pure
geometry
on
analytic
geometry
is
clearly
seen
in
the
development
of
the
notion
of
the
of
a
curve
which
is
the
number
of
tangents
that
may
be
drawn
from
a
point
in
a
plane
to
a
given
curve
lying
in
that
plane
if
a
point
moves
along
a
conic
it
is
easy
to
the
student
is
recommended
to
furnish
the
the
polar
line
with
respect
to
a
conic
remains
tangent
to
another
conic
this
may
be
expressed
by
the
statement
that
the
conic
is
of
the
second
order
and
also
of
the
second
class
it
might
be
thought
that
if
a
point
moved
along
a
cubic
curve
its
polar
line
with
respect
to
a
conic
would
remain
tangent
to
another
cubic
curve
this
is
not
the
case
however
and
the
investigations
of
poncelet
and
others
to
determine
the
class
of
a
given
curve
were
afterward
completed
by
plücker
the
notion
of
geometrical
transformation
led
also
to
the
very
important
developments
in
the
theory
of
invariants
which
geometrically
are
the
elements
and
configurations
which
are
not
affected
by
the
transformation
the
anharmonic
ratio
of
four
points
is
such
an
invariant
since
it
remains
unaltered
under
all
projective
transformations
steiner
and
his
work
in
the
work
of
poncelet
and
his
contemporaries
chasles
brianchon
hachette
dupin
gergonne
and
others
the
anharmonic
ratio
enjoyed
a
fundamental
rôle
it
is
made
also
the
basis
of
the
great
work
of
steiner
who
was
the
first
to
treat
of
the
conic
not
as
the
projection
of
a
circle
but
as
the
locus
of
intersection
of
corresponding
rays
of
two
projective
pencils
steiner
not
only
related
to
each
other
in
correspondence
and
pencils
and
all
the
other
fundamental
forms
but
he
set
into
correspondence
even
curves
and
surfaces
of
higher
degrees
this
new
and
fertile
conception
gave
him
an
easy
and
direct
route
into
the
most
abstract
and
difficult
regions
of
pure
geometry
much
of
his
work
was
given
without
any
indication
of
the
methods
by
which
he
had
arrived
at
it
and
many
of
his
results
have
only
recently
been
verified
von
staudt
and
his
work
to
complete
the
theory
of
geometry
as
we
have
it
it
only
remained
to
free
it
from
its
dependence
on
the
semimetrical
basis
of
the
anharmonic
ratio
this
work
was
accomplished
by
von
staudt
who
applied
himself
to
the
restatement
of
the
theory
of
geometry
in
a
form
independent
of
analytic
and
metrical
notions
the
method
which
has
been
used
in
chapter
ii
to
develop
the
notion
of
four
harmonic
points
by
means
of
the
complete
quadrilateral
is
due
to
von
staudt
his
work
is
characterized
by
a
most
remarkable
generality
in
that
he
is
able
to
discuss
real
and
imaginary
forms
with
equal
ease
thus
he
assumes
a
correspondence
between
the
points
and
lines
of
a
plane
and
defines
a
conic
as
the
locus
of
points
which
lie
on
their
corresponding
lines
and
a
pencil
of
rays
of
the
second
order
as
the
system
of
lines
which
pass
through
their
corresponding
points
the
and
pencil
of
the
second
order
may
be
real
or
imaginary
but
his
theorems
still
apply
an
illustration
of
a
correspondence
of
this
sort
where
the
conic
is
imaginary
is
given
in
of
the
first
chapter
in
defining
conjugate
imaginary
points
on
a
line
von
staudt
made
use
of
an
involution
of
points
having
no
double
points
his
methods
while
elegant
and
powerful
are
hardly
adapted
to
an
elementary
course
but
reye
and
others
have
done
much
toward
simplifying
his
presentation
recent
developments
it
would
be
only
confusing
to
the
student
to
attempt
to
trace
here
the
later
developments
of
the
science
of
protective
geometry
it
is
concerned
for
the
most
part
with
curves
and
surfaces
of
a
higher
degree
than
the
second
purely
synthetic
methods
have
been
used
with
marked
success
in
the
study
of
the
straight
line
in
space
the
struggle
between
analysis
and
pure
geometry
has
long
since
come
to
an
end
each
has
its
distinct
advantages
and
the
mathematician
who
cultivates
one
at
the
expense
of
the
other
will
never
attain
the
results
that
he
would
attain
if
both
methods
were
equally
ready
to
his
hand
pure
geometry
has
to
its
credit
some
of
the
finest
discoveries
in
mathematics
and
need
not
apologize
for
having
been
born
the
day
of
its
usefulness
has
not
passed
with
the
invention
of
abridged
notation
and
of
short
methods
in
analysis
while
we
may
be
certain
that
any
geometrical
problem
may
always
be
stated
in
analytic
form
it
does
not
follow
that
that
statement
will
be
simple
or
easily
interpreted
for
many
mathematicians
the
geometric
intuitions
are
weak
and
for
such
the
method
will
have
little
attraction
on
the
other
hand
there
will
always
be
those
for
whom
the
subject
will
have
a
peculiar
will
follow
with
delight
the
curious
and
unexpected
relations
between
the
forms
of
space
there
is
a
corresponding
pleasure
doubtless
for
the
analyst
in
tracing
the
marvelous
connections
between
the
various
fields
in
which
he
wanders
and
it
is
as
absurd
to
shut
eyes
to
the
beauties
in
one
as
it
is
to
ignore
those
in
the
other
let
us
cultivate
geometry
then
says
darboux
without
wishing
in
all
points
to
equal
it
to
its
rival
besides
if
we
were
tempted
to
neglect
it
it
would
not
be
long
in
finding
in
the
applications
of
mathematics
as
once
it
has
already
done
the
means
of
renewing
its
life
and
of
developing
itself
anew

the
more
general
notion
of
which
includes
the
harmonic
ratio
as
a
special
case
was
also
known
to
the
ancients
while
we
have
not
found
it
necessary
to
make
use
of
the
anharmonic
ratio
in
building
up
our
theory
it
is
so
frequently
met
with
in
treatises
on
geometry
that
some
account
of
it
should
be
given
consider
any
four
points
on
a
line
and
join
them
to
any
point
not
on
that
line
then
the
triangles
having
all
the
same
altitude
are
to
each
other
as
their
bases
also
since
the
area
of
any
triangle
is
one
half
the
product
of
any
two
of
its
sides
by
the
sine
of
the
angle
included
between
them
we
have
formula
now
the
fraction
on
the
right
would
be
unchanged
if
instead
of
the
points
we
should
take
any
other
four
points
lying
on
any
other
line
cutting
across
in
other
words
fraction
on
the
left
is
unaltered
in
value
if
the
points
are
replaced
by
any
other
four
points
perspective
to
again
the
fraction
on
the
left
is
unchanged
if
some
other
point
were
taken
instead
of
in
other
words
fraction
on
the
right
is
unaltered
if
we
replace
the
four
lines
by
any
other
four
lines
perspective
to
the
fraction
on
the
left
is
called
the
of
the
four
points
the
fraction
on
the
right
is
called
the
of
the
four
lines
the
anharmonic
ratio
of
four
points
is
sometimes
written
so
that
formula
if
we
take
the
points
in
different
order
the
value
of
the
anharmonic
ratio
will
not
necessarily
remain
the
same
the
different
ways
of
writing
them
will
however
give
not
more
than
six
different
values
for
the
anharmonic
ratio
for
by
writing
out
the
fractions
which
define
them
we
can
find
that
abcd
badc
cdab
dcba
if
we
write
abcd
it
is
not
difficult
to
show
that
the
six
values
are
formula
the
proof
of
this
we
leave
to
the
student
if
are
four
harmonic
points
see
fig
and
a
quadrilateral
is
constructed
such
that
and
pass
through
and
through
through
and
through
then
projecting
from
upon
we
have
abcd
komd
where
is
the
intersection
of
with
but
projecting
again
the
points
from
back
upon
the
line
we
have
komd
cbad
from
this
we
have
abcd
cbad
or
formula
whence
or
but
it
is
easy
to
see
that
implies
that
two
of
the
four
points
coincide
for
four
harmonic
points
therefore
the
six
values
of
the
anharmonic
ratio
reduce
to
three
namely
formula
and
incidentally
we
see
that
if
an
interchange
of
any
two
points
in
an
anharmonic
ratio
does
not
change
its
value
then
the
four
points
are
harmonic
figure
fig
many
theorems
of
projective
geometry
are
succinctly
stated
in
terms
of
anharmonic
ratios
thus
the
ratio
of
any
four
elements
of
a
form
is
equal
to
the
anharmonic
ratio
of
the
corresponding
four
elements
in
any
form
projectively
related
to
it
the
anharmonic
ratio
of
the

joining
any
four
fixed

on
a

to

the

from
which
four
points
in
a
plane
are
seen
along
four
rays
of
constant
anharmonic
ratio
is
a

we
leave
these
theorems
for
the

who
may
also
justify
the
following
solution
of
the
problem
