whom
it
is
the
author
great
privilege
to
collaborate
as
in
defending
and
vindicating
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
the
principles
and
mandates
of
its
constitution
by
the
earl
of
i
have
been
greatly
honoured
by
your
invitation
to
take
the
chair
on
this
interesting
occasion
it
gives
me
special
pleasure
to
be
able
to
introduce
to
this
distinguished
audience
my
friend
beck
of
the
united
states
it
is
a
great
and
responsible
office
but
long
before
he
held
it
he
was
known
to
the
english
public
and
to
english
readers
as
the
author
who
perhaps
more
than
any
other
writer
in
our
language
contributed
a
statement
of
the
allied
case
in
the
great
war
which
produced
effects
far
beyond
the
country
in
which
it
was
written
or
the
public
to
which
it
was
first
addressed
beck
approached
that
great
theme
in
the
spirit
of
a
great
judge
he
marshalled
his
arguments
with
the
skill
of
a
great
advocate
and
the
combination
of
these
qualities
qualities
highly
appreciated
everywhere
but
nowhere
more
than
in
this
hall
and
among
a
gray
inn
audience
has
given
an
character
to
his
work
he
comes
before
us
in
a
different
character
he
is
neither
judge
nor
advocate
but
historian
and
he
offers
to
guide
us
through
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
important
enterprises
in
which
our
common
race
has
ever
been
engaged
the
framers
of
the
american
constitution
were
faced
with
an
entirely
new
problem
so
far
at
all
events
as
the
world
was
concerned
and
though
they
founded
their
doctrines
upon
the
english
traditions
of
law
and
liberty
they
had
to
deal
with
circumstances
which
none
of
their
british
progenitors
had
to
face
and
they
showed
a
masterly
spirit
in
adapting
the
ideas
of
which
they
were
the
heirs
to
a
new
country
and
new
conditions
the
result
is
one
of
the
greatest
pieces
of
constructive
statesmanship
ever
accomplished
we
who
belong
to
the
british
empire
are
at
this
moment
engaged
under
very
different
circumstances
in
welding
slowly
and
gradually
the
scattered
fragments
of
the
british
empire
into
an
organic
whole
which
must
from
the
very
nature
of
its
geographical
situation
have
a
constitution
as
different
from
that
of
the
british
isles
as
the
constitution
of
the
british
isles
is
different
from
that
of
the
american
states
but
all
three
spring
from
one
root
all
three
are
carried
out
by
men
of
like
political
ideals
all
three
are
destined
to
promote
the
cause
of
ordered
liberty
throughout
the
world
in
the
meanwhile
we
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
can
not
do
better
than
study
under
the
most
favourable
and
fortunate
conditions
the
story
of
the
great
constitutional
adventure
which
has
given
us
the
united
states
of
america

chairman
on
the
occasion
of
the
delivery
on
june
in
gray
inn
of
the
first
of
the
lectures
herein
reprinted
by
sir
john
simon
i
have
the
privilege
and
the
honour
of
adding
a
few
words
to
express
our
thanks
to
the
of
the
united
states
for
this
memorable
course
of
lectures
they
are
memorable
alike
for
their
subject
and
their
form
alike
for
the
place
in
which
we
are
met
and
for
the
man
who
has
so
generously
given
of
his
time
and
learning
for
our
instruction
beck
is
always
a
welcome
visitor
to
our
shores
and
nowhere
is
he
more
welcome
than
in
these
ancient
inns
of
court
which
are
the
home
and
source
of
law
for
americans
and
englishmen
alike
in
contemplating
the
edifice
reared
by
the
fathers
of
the
american
constitution
we
take
pride
in
remembering
that
it
was
built
upon
british
foundations
by
men
many
of
whom
were
trained
in
the
english
courts
and
when
beck
lectures
on
this
subject
to
us
our
interest
and
our
sympathy
are
redoubled
by
the
thought
that
whatever
differences
there
may
be
between
the
old
world
and
the
new
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
ourselves
are
the
sons
of
a
common
mother
and
jointly
inherit
the
treasure
of
the
common
law
and
we
can
not
part
with
beck
on
this
occasion
without
a
personal
word
plato
records
a
saying
of
socrates
that
the
dog
is
a
true
philosopher
because
philosophy
is
love
of
knowledge
and
a
dog
while
growling
at
strangers
always
welcomes
the
friends
that
he
knows
and
the
british
public
often
greets
its
visitors
with
a
touch
of
this
canine
philosophy
we
regard
beck
not
as
a
casual
visitor
but
as
a
firm
friend
to
whom
we
owe
much
he
has
been
here
again
and
again
and
we
hope
will
often
repeat
his
visits
and
englishmen
will
never
forget
how
at
a
crisis
in
our
fate
james
beck
profoundly
influenced
the
judgment
of
the
neutral
world
and
vindicated
by
his
masterly
and
sympathetic
argument
the
justice
of
our
cause
footnote
address
of
sir
john
simon
on
the
conclusion
on
june
of
the
three
lectures
herein
printed
this
book
is
a
result
of
three
lectures
which
were
delivered
in
the
hall
of
gray
inn
london
on
june
and
respectively
under
the
auspices
and
on
the
invitation
of
the
university
of
london
the
invitation
originated
with
the
university
of
manchester
which
through
its
then
ramsay
muir
two
years
ago
graciously
invited
me
to
visit
manchester
and
explain
american
political
institutions
to
the
undergraduates
subsequently
i
was
greatly
honoured
when
the
universities
of
cambridge
edinburgh
and
london
joined
in
the
invitation
unfortunately
for
me
for
i
greatly
valued
the
privilege
of
explaining
the
institutions
of
my
country
to
the
undergraduates
of
these
great
universities
my
political
duties
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
visit
england
prior
to
june
about
which
time
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
which
my
official
duties
largely
preoccupy
my
time
adjourns
for
the
summer
any
dates
after
june
were
inconvenient
to
the
first
three
universities
but
it
was
my
good
fortune
that
the
university
of
london
was
able
to
carry
out
the
plan
and
that
it
had
the
cordial
of
that
venerable
inn
of
court
gray
inn
one
of
the
noblest
nurseries
of
legal
training
thus
i
was
privileged
to
address
at
once
an
academic
and
a
professional
audience
i
came
to
england
for
this
purpose
as
a
labour
of
love
i
had
no
anticipation
of
success
for
i
feared
that
the
interest
in
the
of
my
lectures
would
be
very
slight
my
surprise
and
gratification
increased
on
the
occasion
of
each
lecture
as
the
audiences
grew
in
numbers
and
distinction
many
leading
jurists
and
statesmen
took
more
than
a
mere
complimentary
interest
and
some
of
them
although
pressed
with
social
and
public
duties
honoured
me
with
their
attendance
at
all
three
lectures
how
can
i
adequately
express
my
appreciation
of
the
great
honour
thus
done
me
by
the
earl
of
balfour
the
lord
chancellor
lord
justice
atkin
the
of
the
university
of
london
and
many
other
leaders
in
academic
and
legal
circles
not
to
forget
the
chief
justice
of
the
united
states
who
paid
me
the
great
compliment
of
attending
the
last
lecture
to
one
and
nil
of
my
auditors
my
heartfelt
thanks
i
also
must
not
fail
to
acknowledge
the
generous
space
given
in
the
british
press
to
these
lectures
and
the
even
more
generous
allusions
to
them
in
the
editorial
columns
an
especial
acknowledgment
is
due
to
viscount
burnham
and
daily
for
their
generous
interest
in
this
book
the
good
cause
of
friendship
has
no
better
friend
than
lord
burnham
this
experience
has
convinced
me
that
now
more
than
ever
before
there
is
in
england
a
deep
interest
in
american
institutions
and
their
history
this
is
as
it
should
be
for
for
better
or
worse
england
and
america
will
play
together
a
great
part
in
the
future
history
of
the
world
in
double
harness
they
are
destined
to
pull
the
heavy
load
of
the
world
problems
therefore
these
in
equity
must
know
each
other
better
and
what
is
more
as
i
was
revising
the
proofs
of
these
lectures
in
beautiful
chamonix
the
prospectus
of
the
association
reached
me
in
which
its
honorary
secretary
and
my
good
friend
charles
sarolea
took
occasion
to
make
the
following
suggestion
to
his
british
compatriots
to
remove
those
causes
of
estrangement
to
avoid
a
fateful
catastrophe
in
other
words
to
bring
about
a
cordial
understanding
america
the
first
condition
must
be
an
understanding
america
such
an
understanding
or
even
the
atmosphere
in
which
such
an
understanding
may
grow
has
still
to
be
created
it
is
indeed
passing
strange
that
in
these
days
of
cheap
books
and
free
education
america
should
be
almost
a
that
we
should
know
next
to
nothing
of
american
history
of
the
american
constitution
of
american
practical
politics
of
the
american
mentality
we
scarcely
read
american
newspapers
or
american
books
even
such
masters
of
classical
prose
as
francis
parkman
perhaps
the
greatest
historian
who
has
used
the
english
language
as
his
vehicle
are
almost
unknown
to
the
average
reader
our
students
do
not
visit
american
universities
as
they
used
before
the
war
to
visit
german
universities
the
consequence
is
that
again
and
again
we
are
running
the
risk
of
perpetrating
the
most
grotesque
errors
of
judgment
of
committing
the
most
serious
political
blunders
in
defiance
of
american
public
opinion
the
success
of
my
gray
inn
lectures
convinces
me
that
sarolea
underestimates
the
interest
in
america
and
its
history
in
england
however
the
episode
which
is
treated
in
these
lectures
is
as
he
says
not
only
in
england
but
even
in
the
united
states
it
is
amazing
how
little
is
known
in
america
of
the
facts
given
in
my
second
lecture
the
american
student
after
rejoicing
in
the
victory
at
yorktown
and
the
end
of
the
war
of
independence
generally
skips
about
eight
years
to
mid
his
interest
in
the
history
of
his
own
country
recommences
with
the
inauguration
of
president
washington
students
of
history
in
both
countries
thus
miss
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
instructive
chapters
of
american
history
and
indeed
of
any
history
i
have
ventured
to
add
to
my
gray
inn
lectures
another
address
which
i
delivered
as
the
annual
address
at
the
session
of
the
american
bar
association
in
cincinnati
ohio
on
august
i
do
so
because
it
has
a
direct
bearing
on
the
decay
of
the
spirit
of
constitutionalism
both
in
america
and
elsewhere
it
discusses
a
great
of
our
age
for
which
i
fear
no
written
constitution
however
wise
is
an
adequate
remedy
it
was
published
in
condensed
form
in
the
issue
of
the
for
october
and
an
acknowledgment
is
due
to
its
courteous
editor
for
permission
to
republish
it
i
have
forborne
in
these
lectures
to
make
more
than
a
passing
reference
to
the
league
of
nations
and
the
great
conference
which
framed
it
tempting
as
the
obvious
analogy
was
the
reader
who
studies
the
appendices
will
see
that
the
covenant
of
the
league
more
nearly
resembles
the
articles
of
confederation
than
the
constitution
of
i
only
mention
the
subject
to
suggest
that
the
reader
of
these
lectures
will
better
understand
why
the
american
people
take
the
written
obligations
of
the
league
so
seriously
and
literally
we
have
been
trained
for
nearly
a
century
and
a
half
to
measure
the
validity
and
obligations
of
laws
and
executive
acts
in
courts
of
justice
and
to
apply
the
plain
import
of
the
constitution
our
constant
inquiry
is
is
it
so
nominated
in
that
compact
in
europe
and
especially
england
constitutionalism
is
largely
a
spirit
of
great
objectives
and
ideals
therefore
while
in
these
nations
the
literal
obligations
of
articles
x
xi
xv
and
xvi
of
the
covenant
of
the
league
are
not
taken
rigidly
we
in
america
pursuant
to
our
habit
of
constitutionalism
interpret
these
clauses
as
we
do
those
of
our
constitution
and
we
ask
ourselves
are
we
ready
to
promise
to
do
that
which
these
articles
literally
import
join
for
example
in
a
commercial
social
and
even
military
war
against
any
nation
that
is
deemed
an
aggressor
however
remote
the
cause
of
the
war
may
be
to
us
are
we
prepared
to
say
that
in
the
event
of
a
war
or
threatened
danger
of
war
the
supreme
council
of
the
league
may
take
any
action
it
deems
wise
and
effectual
to
maintain
peace
this
is
a
very
serious
committal
other
nations
may
not
take
it
so
literally
but
with
our
adherence
to
a
written
constitution
as
a
solemn
contractual
obligation
we
do
this
is
said
in
no
spirit
of
hostility
to
the
league
but
only
to
explain
the
american
point
of
view
since
i
delivered
these
lectures
i
took
a
short
trip
to
the
continent
and
while
sojourning
in
geneva
made
a
visit
to
the
offices
of
the
league
all
i
there
saw
greatly
interested
me
and
i
could
have
nothing
but
a
feeling
of
admiration
for
the
effective
and
useful
administrative
work
which
the
league
is
doing
the
men
who
framed
the
covenant
of
the
league
tried
to
do
under
more
difficult
but
not
dissimilar
conditions
what
the
framers
of
the
american
constitution
did
in
in
both
cases
the
aim
was
high
the
great
purpose
meritorious
those
americans
who
for
the
reasons
stated
are
not
in
sympathy
with
the
structural
form
and
political
objectives
of
the
league
are
not
lacking
in
sympathy
for
its
admirable
administrative
work
in
the
activities
of
civilized
nations
for
the
common
good
in
any
study
of
a
world
constitution
the
example
of
those
who
framed
the
american
constitution
can
be
studied
with
profit

of

purpulei

ornament
any

for

in
this
and
two
succeeding
addresses
to
the
genesis
formulation
and
the
fundamental
political
philosophy
of
the
constitution
of
the

the
occasion
gives
me
peculiar
satisfaction
not
only
in
the
opportunity
to
thank
my
fellow
benchers
of
the
inn
for
their
graciousness
in
granting
the
use
of
this
noble
hall
for
this
purpose
but
also
because
the
delivery
of
these
addresses
now
enables
me
to
be
for
the
moment
in
fact
as
in
honorary
title
a
bencher
or
reader
of
this
society
if
i
needed
any
justification
for
addresses
which
i
was
graciously
invited
to
deliver
under
the
auspices
of
the
university
of
london
an
honour
which
i
also
gratefully
acknowledge
it
would
lie
in
the
fact
that
we
are
to
consider
one
of
the
supremely
great
achievements
of
the
race
it
is
in
that
aspect
that
i
shall
treat
my
theme
for
as
a
philosophical
or
juristic
discussion
of

my
addresses
will
be
neither
as
deep
as
a
well
nor
as
wide
as
a
church
door
my
auditors
will
bear
in
mind
that
i
must
limit
each
address
to
the
duration
of
an
hour
and
that
i
can
not
go
deeply
or
exhaustively
into
a
subject
that
has
challenged
the
admiring
comment
and
profound
consideration
of
the
intellectual
world
for
nearly
a
century
and
a
half
if
england
and
america
are
to
act
together
in
the
coming
time
and
the
destinies
of
the
world
are
to
a
very
large
extent
in
their
keeping
then
they
must
know
each
other
better
and
to
this
end
they
must
take
a
greater
interest
in
each
other
history
and
political
institutions

principal
purpose
in
these
lectures
is
to
deepen
the
interest
of
this
great
nation
in
one
of
the
very
greatest
and
achievements
of
our
common
race
americans
have
never
lacked
interest
in
english
history
for
however
broad
the
stream
of
our
national
life
how
could
we
ignore
its
chief
source
but
is
there
in
england
an
equal
interest
in
the
history
of
america
whose
origin
and
development
constitute
one
of
the
most
dramatic
and
significant
dramas
ever
played
upon
the
stage
of
this
wide
and
universal
theatre
of
man
it
is
true
that
thackeray
in
his
gave
us
in
fiction
the
finest
picture
of
our
colonial
life
and
the
late
and
deeply
lamented
lord
bryce
wrote
one
of
the
best
commentaries
upon
our
institutions
in
american
in
more
recent
years
two
of
the
most
moving
portraits
of
our
hamilton
and
lincoln
are
due
to
your
oliver
and
lord
charnwood
we
gratefully
recognize
this
and
yet
how
many
educated
englishmen
have
studied
that
little
known
chapter
of
our
history
which
gave
to
the
progress
of
mankind
a
contribution
to
political
science
which
your
gladstone
praised
as
the
greatest
ever
struck
off
at
a
given
time
by
the
brain
and
purpose
of
man
if
peace
hath
her
victories
no
less
renown
than
war
this
achievement
may
well
justify
your
study
and
awaken
your
admiration
for
as
i
have
already
said
and
can
not
too
strongly
emphasize
it
was
the
work
of
the
race
of
men
who
shortly
before
they
entered
upon
this
great
work
of
constructive
statecraft
were
citizens
of
your
empire
the
conditions
of
colonial
development
had
profoundly
stimulated
in
these
english
pioneers
the
sense
and
genius
for
constitutionalism
in
his
speech
on
conciliation
with
america
of
march
edmund
burke
showed
his
characteristically
philosophic
comprehension
of
this
powerful
constitutional
conscience
of
the
then
american
subjects
of
the
empire
after
stating
that
in
no
other
country
in
the
world
was
law
so
generally
studied
and
referring
to
the
fact
that
as
many
copies
of
blackstone
commentaries
had
been
sold
in
america
as
in
england
he
added
this
study
renders
men
acute
inquisitive
dexterous
prompt
in
attack
ready
in
defence
full
of
resources
in
other
countries
the
people
more
simple
and
of
a
less
mercurial
cast
judge
of
an
ill
principle
in
government
only
by
an
actual
grievance
here
they
anticipate
the
evil
and
judge
of
the
pressure
of
the
grievance
by
the
badness
of
the
principle
moreover
these
hardy
pioneers
were
the
privileged
heirs
of
the
great
political
traditions
of
england
while
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
very
much
more
than
an
adaptation
of
the
british
constitution
yet
its
underlying
spirit
was
that
of
the
english
speaking
race
and
the
common
law
behind
the
framers
of
the
constitution
as
they
entered
upon
their
momentous
task
were
the
mighty
shades
of
simon
de
montfort
coke
sandys
bacon
eliot
hampden
lilburne
milton
shaftesbury
and
locke
could
there
be
a
better
illustration
of
sir
frederick
pollock
noble
tribute
to
the
genius
of
the
common
law
remember
that
our
lady
the
common
law
is
not
a
but
a
bountiful
sovereign
whose
service
is
freedom
the
destinies
of
the
world
are
bound
up
with
her
fortunes
and
migrations
and
its
conquests
are
justified
by
her
works
another
reason
makes
the
consideration
of
the
subject
not
only
interesting
but
opportune
these
are
the
times
that
try
men
souls
it
is
a
time
of
sifting
when
men
of
all
nations
in
civilization
in
these
critical
days
are
again
testing
the
value
even
of
those
political
institutions
which
have
the
sanction
of
the
past
society
is
in
a
state
of
flux
everywhere
the
foundations
of
governmental
structures
seem
to
be
settling
let
us
hope
and
pray
upon
a
foundation
and
when
the
seismic
convulsion
of
the
world
war
is
taken
into
account
it
is
not
surprising
that
this
is
so
while
the
storm
is
not
yet
past
and
the
waves
have
not
wholly
subsided
it
is
natural
that
everywhere
thoughtful
men
as
true
mariners
are
taking
their
reckonings
to
know
where
they
are
and
whether
the
frail
bark
of
human
institutions
is
still
sufficiently
seaworthy
to
keep
afloat
moreover
the
patent
evidences
of
weakness
in
the
international
organization
that
we
call
civilization
the
imperative
need
of
ending
the
spirit
of
moral
anarchy
and
the
urgent
necessity
of
rebuilding
the
shattered
ruins
of
the
social
edifice
on
surer
foundations
by
the
integration
of
the
nations
if
possible
into
some
new
form
of
world
organization
gives
peculiar
interest
in
these
terrible
days
to
the
manner
in
which
the
american
people
solved
a
similar
problem
more
than
a
century
ago
then
as
now
a
world
war
had
ended
then
as
now
half
the
world
was
prostrated
by
the
wounds
of
fratricidal
strife
as
washington
said
the
whole
world
was
in
an
uproar
and
he
added
that
the
task
was
to
steer
safely
between
scylla
and
charybdis
the
problem
then
as
now
was
not
only
to
make
the
world
safe
for
democracy
but
to
make
democracy
for
which
there
is
no
alternative
safe
for
the
world
the
thirteen
colonies
in
while
small
and
relatively
unimportant
were
however
a
little
world
in
themselves
and
relatively
to
their
numbers
and
resources
this
problem
which
they
confronted
and
solved
differed
in
degree
but
not
in
kind
from
that
which
now
confronts
civilization
impoverished
in
resources
exhausted
by
the
loss
of
the
flower
of
their
youth
demoralized
by
the
reaction
from
feverish
strife
the
forces
of
disintegration
had
set
in
in
the
united
states
between
and
law
and
order
had
almost
perished
and
the
provisional
government
had
been
reduced
to
impotence
a
few
wise
and
noble
spirits
true
faithfuls
and
great
hearts
led
a
despondent
people
out
of
the
slough
of
despond
till
their
feet
were
again
on
firm
ground
and
their
faces
turned
towards
the
delectable
mountains
of
peace
justice
and
liberty
let
it
be
emphasized
that
they
did
this
not
by
seeking
more
power
but
by
imposing
restraints
upon
themselves
that
spirit
of
is
the
essence
of
the
american
constitution
so
enduring
was
their
achievement
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
the
oldest
comprehensive
written
form
of
government
now
existing
in
the
world
few
if
any
forms
of
government
have
better
withstood
the
mad
spirit
of
innovation
or
more
effectively
proved
their
merit
by
the
arduous
greatness
of
things
done
for
this
reason
as
the
nations
of
the
world
are
now
trying
in
a
cosmic
form
and
under
similar
conditions
to
do
that
which
the
founders
of
the
american
republic
in
did
in
a
microcosmic
form
a
short
narration
of
that
earlier
achievement
may
not
be
unprofitable
in
this
day
and
generation
when
we
are
blindly
groping
towards
some
common
basis
for
international
one
of
england
greatest
prime
ministers
william
pitt
shortly
after
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
prophetically
said
that
it
would
be
the
admiration
of
the
future
ages
and
the
pattern
for
future
constitution
building
time
has
verified
his
prediction
for
constitution
making
has
been
since
the
american
constitution
was
adopted
a
continuous
industry
the
american
constitution
has
been
the
classic
model
for
the
federated
state
lieber
estimated
that
three
hundred
and
fifty
constitutions
were
made
in
the
first
sixty
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
in
the
constituent
states
of
the
american
union
one
hundred
and
three
new
constitutions
were
promulgated
in
the
first
century
of
the
united
states
have
you
a
copy
of
the
french
constitution
was
asked
of
a
bookseller
during
the
second
french
empire
and
the
characteristically
witty
gallic
reply
was
we
do
not
deal
in
periodical
literature
constitutions
as
governmental
panaceas
have
come
and
gone
but
it
can
be
said
of
the
american
constitution
paraphrasing
the
noble
tribute
of
johnson
to
the
immortal
fame
of
shakespeare
that
the
stream
of
time
which
has
washed
away
the
dissoluble
fabric
of
many
other
paper
constitutions
has
left
almost
untouched
its
adamantine
strength
excepting
the
first
ten
amendments
which
were
virtually
a
part
of
the
original
charter
only
nine
others
have
been
adopted
in
more
than
one
hundred
and
thirty
years
a
constitution
while
primarily
for
the
distribution
of
governmental
powers
is
in
its
last
analysis
a
formal
expression
of
adherence
to
that
which
in
modern
times
has
been
called
the
higher
law
and
which
in
ancient
times
was
called
natural
law
the
jurisprudence
of
every
nation
has
with
more
or
less
clearness
recognized
the
existence
of
certain
primal
and
fundamental
laws
which
are
superior
to
the
laws
statutes
or
conventions
of
living
generations
the
original
use
of
the
term
was
to
import
the
superiority
of
the
imperial
edict
to
the
laws
of
the
comitia
all
nations
have
recognized
this
higher
law
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
if
we
turn
to
the
writings
of
the
most
intellectual
race
in
ancient
time
and
possibly
in
recorded
history
the
greeks
we
shall
see
the
higher
law
vindicated
with
incomparable
power
in
the
moral
philosophy
of
its
three
greatest
dramatists
aeschylus
sophocles
and
euripides
how
was
it
better
expressed
than
by
antigone
when
she
was
asked
whether
she
had
transgressed
the
laws
of
the
state
and
replied
yes
for
that
law
was
not
from
zeus
nor
did
justice
dweller
with
the
gods
below
establish
it
among
men
nor
deemed
i
that
thy
decree
mere
mortal
that
thou
art
could
override
those
unwritten
and
unfailing
mandates
which
are
not
of
or
yesterday
but
ever
live
and
no
one
knows
their
birthtide
five
centuries
later
the
greatest
of
the
roman
lawyers
and
orators
cicero
spoke
in
the
same
terms
of
a
higher
law
which
was
never
written
and
which
we
are
never
taught
which
we
never
team
by
reading
but
which
was
drawn
by
nature
herself
the
roman
jurists
gave
it
express
recognition
they
always
recognized
the
distinction
between
or
the
law
of
the
state
and
the
or
the
law
of
nature
they
nobly
conceived
that
human
society
was
a
single
unit
and
that
it
was
governed
by
a
law
that
was
both
antecedent
and
paramount
to
the
law
of
rome
thus
the
idea
of
a
higher
law
transcending
the
power
of
a
living
generation
and
therefore
eternal
as
justice
itself
became
lodged
in
our
system
of
jurisprudence
nor
was
the
common
law
wanting
in
a
recognition
of
a
higher
law
that
would
curb
the
power
of
king
or
parliament
for
its
earlier
masters
including
four
chief
justices
coke
hobart
holt
and
popham
supported
the
doctrine
as
laid
down
by
coke
that
the
judiciary
had
the
power
to
nullify
a
law
if
it
were
against
common
right
and
reason
coke
reports
this
view
as
to
the
limitation
of
government
and
the
denial
of
its
omnipotence
was
powerfully
accentuated
in
america
by
the
very
conditions
of
its
colonization
the
good
yeomen
of
england
who
journeyed
to
america
went
in
the
spirit
of
the
noble
and
intrepid
kent
when
turning
his
back
upon
king
lear
temporary
injustice
he
said
that
he
would
shape
his
old
course
in
a
country
new
was
it
strange
that
the
early
colonists
as
they
braved
the
hardships
and
perils
of
a
dangerous
voyage
only
to
be
confronted
in
the
wilderness
by
disease
famine
and
massacre
should
fall
back
for
their
own
government
upon
these
primal
verities
of
human
society
and
claim
not
only
their
inherited
rights
as
englishmen
but
also
the
peculiar
privileges
of
pioneers
in
an
unconquered
wilderness
this
spirit
of
constitutionalism
in
america
which
culminated
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
had
its
institutional
origin
in
the
spacious
days
of
queen
elizabeth
that
wonderful
age
which
gave
to
the
world
not
only
shakespeare
spenser
and
jonson
but
also
drake
frobisher
and
raleigh
was
the
reaction
to
the
renaissance
the
spirit
of
man
had
a
new
birth
and
was
breaking
away
from
the
too
rigid
bonds
of
ancient
custom
and
authority
among
the
notable
but
little
known
leaders
of
that
time
was
sir
edwin
sandys
the
leading
spirit
of
the
london
or
virginia
company
he
was
a
liberal
when
to
be
such
was
an
extra
hazardous
risk
he
was
the
son
of
a
liberal
for
his
father
a
great
prelate
had
been
sent
to
the
tower
for
preaching
in
defence
of
lady
jane
grey
the
son
sir
edwin
was
the
foe
of
monopolies
and
in
the
same
parliament
that
impeached
the
great
genius
of
this
inn
francis
bacon
sandys
advocated
the
then
novel
proposition
that
accused
prisoners
should
have
the
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel
to
which
the
strange
objection
was
made
that
it
would
subvert
the
administration
of
justice
as
early
as
he
had
boldly
declared
in
parliament
that
even
the
king
authority
rested
upon
the
clear
understanding
that
there
were
reciprocal
conditions
which
neither
ruler
nor
subject
could
violate
with
impunity
he
might
not
too
fancifully
be
called
the
father
of
american
constitutionalism
for
he
caused
a
constitution
possibly
the
first
time
that
that
word
was
ever
applied
to
a
comprehensive
scheme
of
government
to
be
drafted
for
the
little
colony
of
virginia
in
and
amplified
in
speaking
in
this
venerable
hall
whose
very
walls
eloquently
remind
us
of
the
mighty
genius
of
francis
bacon
it
is
interesting
to
recall
that
these
two
charters
of
government
which
were
the
beginning
of
constitutionalism
in
america
and
therefore
the
germ
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
were
put
in
legal
form
for
royal
approval
by
lord
bacon
himself
thus
the
immortal
treasurer
of
this
inn
is
directly
linked
with
the
development
of
constitutional
freedom
in
america
bacon
became
a
member
of
the
council
for
the
virginia
company
in
his
deep
interest
in
it
is
attested
in
the
dedication
to
him
by
william
strachey
in
of
the
latter
of
travaile
into
virginia
in
his
speech
in
the
house
of
commons
on
january
bacon
saw
a
vision
of
the
future
and
predicted
the
growth
of
america
when
he
said
this
kingdom
now
first
in
his
majesty
times
hath
gotten
a
lot
or
portion
in
the
new
world
by
the
plantation
of
virginia
and
the
summer
islands
and
certainly
it
is
with
the
kingdoms
on
earth
as
it
is
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
sometimes
a
grain
of
mustard
seed
proves
a
great
tree
truly
the
mustard
seed
of
virginia
did
become
a
great
tree
in
the
american
commonwealth
one
of
bacon
nephews
also
of
the
inns
of
court
nathaniel
bacon
became
the
first
liberal
leader
in
the
colonies
and
led
the
first
revolt
against
colonial
misrule
he
was
probably
of
gray
inn
for
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
a
bacon
studying
in
any
inn
than
the
one
to
which
the
great
bacon
had
given
so
much
loving
care
due
to
these
charters
on
july
the
little
remnant
of
colonists
whom
disease
and
famine
had
left
untouched
were
summoned
to
meet
in
the
church
at
jamestown
to
form
the
first
parliamentary
assembly
in
america
the
of
the
fruitful
mother
of
parliaments
it
was
due
to
sandys
not
only
that
the
first
permanent
english
settlement
in
the
western
world
was
planted
at
jamestown
in
but
that
a
later
group
of
adventurers
for
such
they
called
themselves
destined
to
be
more
famous
were
driven
by
chance
of
wind
and
wave
to
land
on
the
coast
of
massachusetts
thus
was
established
not
only
the
beginning
of
colonial
empire
still
one
of
the
most
beneficent
forces
in
the
world
but
also
the
principle
of
local
which
in
the
western
world
was
destined
to
develop
the
american
commonwealth
the
compact
signed
in
the
cabin
of
the
while
not
in
strictness
a
constitution
like
the
virginia
charter
was
yet
destined
to
be
a
landmark
of
history
sandys
suffered
for
his
convictions
for
the
party
of
reaction
convinced
king
james
that
virginia
was
a
nest
of
sedition
and
the
arbitrary
ruler
in
the
reorganization
of
the
london
company
gave
a
pointed
admonition
by
saying
choose
the
devil
if
you
will
but
not
sir
edwin
sandys
in
he
was
committed
to
the
tower
and
only
released
after
the
house
of
commons
had
made
a
vigorous
protest
against
his
incarceration
his
successor
as
treasurer
of
the
london
company
was
shakespeare
patron
the
earl
of
southampton
and
it
is
not
a
fanciful
conjecture
to
assume
that
when
the
news
of
the
disaster
which
befell
one
of
the
fleets
of
the
london
company
on
the
island
of
bermuda
reached
england
it
inspired
shakespeare
to
write
his
incomparable
sea
idyl
if
so
this
lovely
drama
was
shakespeare
unconscious
apostrophe
to
america
for
in
ariel
seeking
to
be
free
can
be
symbolized
her
awakening
spirit
while
prospero
with
his
thaumaturgic
achievements
suggests
a
constructive
genius
which
in
a
little
more
than
a
century
has
made
one
of
the
least
of
the
nations
one
of
the
greatest
bacon
sandys
southampton
and
the
liberal
leaders
of
the
house
of
commons
had
implanted
in
the
ideas
of
the
colonists
the
spirit
of
constitutionalism
which
was
destined
to
influence
profoundly
the
whole
development
of
the
american
colonies
and
finally
to
culminate
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
later
struggle
in
the
long
parliament
the
fall
of
charles
i
and
more
especially
the
deposition
of
james
ii
the
accession
of
william
of
orange
and
the
substitution
for
the
stuart
claim
of
divine
right
that
of
the
supremacy
of
the
people
in
parliament
naturally
had
their
reaction
in
the
western
world
in
intensifying
the
spirit
of
constitutionalism
in
the
growing
american
commonwealth
the
colonial
history
was
therefore
increasingly
marked
by
a
spirit
of
individualism
a
natural
partiality
for
local
rule
and
a
tenacious
adherence
to
their
special
privileges
whether
granted
to
crown
colonies
like
new
hampshire
new
york
new
jersey
virginia
the
two
carolinas
and
georgia
or
proprietary
governments
like
maryland
delaware
and
pennsylvania
or
charter
governments
such
as
massachusetts
rhode
island
and
connecticut
in
the
three
colonies
last
named
formal
corporate
charters
were
granted
by
the
crown
which
in
themselves
were
constitutions
in
embryo
and
the
colonists
thus
acquired
written
rights
as
to
the
government
of
their
internal
affairs
upon
the
maintenance
of
which
they
jealously
insisted
thus
arose
the
spirit
in
america
which
treated
constitutional
rights
not
so
much
as
special
privileges
granted
by
plenary
sovereignty
but
as
contractual
obligations
which
could
be
enforced
in
the
courts
against
the
sovereign
all
this
developed
in
the
colonists
a
powerful
sense
of
constitutional
morality
and
its
pertinency
to
my
present
theme
lies
in
the
fact
that
when
each
of
the
thirteen
colonies
became
at
the
conclusion
of
the
war
of
independence
a
separate
and
independent
nation
they
were
more
concerned
in
establishing
a
central
government
to
limit
its
authority
and
to
maintain
local
than
they
were
to
give
to
the
nation
the
powers
which
it
needed
they
carried
their
constitutionalism
to
extremes
which
nearly
made
a
strong
and
efficient
central
government
an
impossibility
nothing
was
less
desired
by
them
than
a
unified
government
it
was
destined
to
be
wrung
from
their
hard
necessities
the
constitution
was
the
reflex
action
of
two
opposing
tendencies
the
one
the
imperative
need
of
an
efficient
central
government
and
the
other
the
passionate
attachment
to
local
between
the
colonies
had
been
a
matter
of
long
discussion
and
earnest
debate
and
primarily
resulted
from
the
necessity
of
defence
against
a
common
foe
the
french
in
canada
and
the
indians
of
the
forest
in
four
of
the
new
england
colonies
united
in
a
league
to
defend
themselves
in
william
penn
made
the
first
suggestion
for
a
union
of
all
the
colonies
in
a
council
was
held
at
albany
at
the
instance
of
the
crown
to
provide
the
means
for
the
defence
against
france
in
canada
and
it
was
then
that
franklin
submitted
the
first
concrete
form
for
a
union
of
the
colonies
into
a
permanent
alliance
it
was
in
advance
of
the
times
for
conservative
as
it
was
it
was
unfortunately
opposed
both
by
the
crown
and
the
colonies
themselves
the
time
was
not
ripe
for
any
such
union
and
the
reason
was
apparent
the
colonies
differed
very
much
in
the
character
of
their
populations
in
the
nature
of
their
economic
interests
and
in
their
political
antecedents
they
were
not
wholly
of
the
english
race
many
nations
in
europe
had
already
contributed
to
the
population
for
example
new
york
was
partly
dutch
and
in
pennsylvania
there
was
a
considerable
element
of
the
swedes
germans
and
swiss
moreover
the
colonists
were
as
widely
separated
from
each
other
measured
by
the
facilities
of
locomotion
as
are
the
most
remote
nations
of
the
world
only
a
few
men
ever
found
occasion
to
leave
their
colony
to
journey
to
another
and
most
men
never
left
from
birth
to
death
the
community
in
which
they
lived
outside
of
the
few
scattered
communities
in
the
different
colonies
there
was
an
almost
unbroken
wilderness
with
few
wagon
roads
and
in
places
only
a
bridle
path
the
only
methods
of
communication
were
the
letters
and
still
fewer
newspapers
which
were
carried
by
post
riders
often
through
an
almost
trackless
wilderness
obviously
a
working
government
could
not
easily
be
constituted
between
peoples
of
different
religions
races
and
economic
interests
who
for
the
most
part
never
met
each
other
face
to
face
and
with
whom
frequent
communication
was
impossible
the
differences
between
the
colonies
and
the
with
respect
to
internal
taxation
slowly
developed
into
an
issue
of
constitutionalism
rather
than
of
legislative
policy
as
in
england
the
immediate
question
affected
the
power
of
the
crown
to
give
to
the
customs
inspectors
the
power
to
make
general
searches
and
seizures
to
enforce
the
navigation
laws
in
james
otis
of
massachusetts
made
a
fateful
speech
before
the
colonial
legislature
in
which
asserting
the
illegality
of
the
search
warrants
on
the
ground
that
they
violated
the
constitutional
rights
of
englishmen
to
protection
in
their
own
homes
he
asserted
that
acts
of
parliament
which
violated
the
sanctity
of
the
home
were
void
and
that
more
specifically
they
violated
the
charter
granted
to
massachusetts
asserting
the
doctrine
which
at
that
time
was
the
doctrine
of
the
english
common
law
as
stated
by
coke
and
three
other
chief
justices
he
said
to
say
the
parliament
is
absolute
and
arbitrary
is
a
contradiction
the
parliament
can
not
make
two
and
two
five
omnipotency
can
not
do
it
parliaments
are
in
all
cases
to
declare
what
is
for
the
good
of
the
whole
but
it
is
not
the
declaration
of
parliament
that
makes
it
so
there
must
be
in
every
instance
a
higher
authority
god
should
an
act
of
parliament
be
against
any
of
his
natural
laws
which
are
immutably
true
their
declaration
would
be
contrary
to
eternal
truth
equity
and
justice
and
consequently
void
and
so
it
would
be
adjudged
by
the
parliament
itself
when
convinced
of
their
mistake
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
in
the
reaction
from
the
tyranny
of
the
stuarts
your
country
abandoned
this
principle
of
the
common
law
by
substituting
for
the
omnipotence
of
the
crown
the
omnipotence
of
parliament
while
in
my
country
the
somewhat
vague
and
unworkable
principle
of
the
common
law
which
gave
the
judiciary
the
power
to
invalidate
an
act
of
the
legislature
when
against
natural
reason
and
justice
was
developed
into
the
great
principle
without
which
institutions
in
an
heterogeneous
and
widely
scattered
democracy
would
be
unworkable
namely
that
the
powers
of
government
are
strictly
defined
and
that
neither
the
executive
the
legislative
nor
the
judicial
departments
of
the
government
can
go
beyond
the
precise
limits
established
by
the
fundamental
law
like
the
common
law
the
constitution
was
thus
the
result
of
a
slow
evolution
gladstone
in
his
remark
gave
an
erroneous
impression
when
he
said
as
the
british
constitution
is
the
most
subtle
organism
which
has
proceeded
from
progressive
history
so
the
american
constitution
is
the
most
wonderful
work
ever
struck
off
at
a
given
time
by
the
brain
and
purpose
of
man
this
assumes
that
the
constitution
sprang
like
minerva
armed
from
the
brain
of
the
american
people
whereas
it
was
as
much
the
result
of
a
slow
laborious
and
painful
evolution
as
was
the
british
constitution
probably
gladstone
so
understood
the
development
of
the
american
constitution
and
recognized
that
its
framing
was
only
the
culmination
of
an
evolution
of
many
years
when
the
constitutional
struggle
between
the
colonies
and
the
parliament
became
acute
the
necessity
of
a
union
for
a
common
defence
became
imperative
as
early
as
july
franklin
recommended
the
convening
of
a
general
congress
so
that
the
colonies
would
act
together
his
suggestion
was
introduced
in
the
virginia
house
of
burgesses
in
may
and
as
a
result
there
met
in
philadelphia
on
september
of
that
year
the
first
continental
congress
styled
by
themselves
the
delegates
appointed
by
the
good
people
of
these
colonies
nothing
was
further
from
their
purpose
than
to
form
a
central
government
or
to
separate
from
england
this
congress
only
met
as
a
conference
of
representatives
of
the
colonies
to
defend
what
they
conceived
to
be
their
constitutional
rights
before
the
second
continental
congress
met
in
the
following
year
the
accidental
clash
at
lexington
and
concord
had
taken
place
and
as
the
congress
again
a
momentous
change
had
taken
place
which
was
in
fact
the
beginning
of
the
american
commonwealth
the
congress
became
by
force
of
circumstances
a
provisional
government
and
as
such
it
might
well
have
claimed
plenary
powers
to
meet
an
immediate
exigency
so
indisposed
were
they
to
separate
from
england
or
to
substitute
for
its
rule
that
of
a
new
government
that
the
continental
congress
when
it
then
involuntarily
took
over
the
government
of
america
failed
to
exercise
any
adequate
power
it
remained
simply
a
conference
without
real
power
each
colony
had
one
vote
and
the
rule
of
unanimity
prevailed
even
its
decisions
were
largely
advisory
for
they
amounted
to
little
more
than
recommendations
to
the
constituent
states
as
to
what
measures
should
be
taken
each
colony
complied
with
the
recommendation
in
its
discretion
and
in
its
own
way
notwithstanding
this
fatal
lack
of
authority
the
continental
congress
then
actually
engaged
in
civil
war
created
an
army
and
through
its
committees
entered
into
negotiations
with
foreign
nations
to
support
the
former
it
issued
paper
money
with
the
disastrous
result
that
could
be
readily
anticipated
while
it
had
a
presiding
officer
it
had
no
executive
and
the
new
nation
which
was
hardly
conscious
of
its
own
birth
had
no
judiciary
had
this
government
assumed
the
plenary
powers
which
provisional
governments
must
under
similar
circumstances
necessarily
assume
it
would
have
been
better
for
the
cause
of
the
colonists
for
want
of
an
efficient
central
government
the
civil
administration
of
the
infant
nation
was
marked
by
a
weakness
and
incapacity
that
defeated
washington
plans
and
nearly
broke
his
spirit
washington
little
army
was
the
victim
of
the
gross
incapacity
of
an
impotent
government
the
soldiers
came
and
went
not
as
the
general
commanded
but
as
the
various
colonies
permitted
the
tragedy
of
valley
forge
when
the
little
army
nearly
starved
to
death
and
literally
the
soldiers
could
be
tracked
over
the
snows
by
their
bleeding
unshod
feet
was
not
due
to
lack
of
clothing
and
provisions
but
to
the
gross
incapacity
of
a
headless
government
that
if
it
had
had
the
wisdom
to
act
lacked
the
authority
the
situation
was
one
of
chaos
the
colonies
recruited
their
own
contingents
paid
such
taxes
as
they
pleased
which
grew
increasingly
less
and
the
congress
had
no
coercive
power
to
enforce
its
policies
either
with
reference
to
internal
or
external
affairs
this
situation
was
so
clearly
recognized
that
immediately
after
the
declaration
of
independence
on
july
the
draft
of
a
constitution
was
proposed
to
give
the
central
government
more
effective
power
but
although
the
necessity
was
manifest
and
most
urgent
the
articles
of
confederation
which
were
then
drafted
in
were
never
finally
adopted
by
the
requisite
number
of
states
until
march
when
the
war
was
nearly
over
as
the
result
proved
they
marked
only
a
very
small
advance
over
the
existing
government
for
the
constituent
states
were
still
too
jealous
of
each
other
and
too
hostile
to
the
creation
of
a
central
government
to
form
a
truly
effective
government
the
founders
of
the
republic
could
only
learn
from
their
errors
but
it
is
their
great
merit
that
they
had
the
ability
to
profit
in
the
stern
school
of
experience
of
which
franklin
has
said
that
it
is
a
dear
school
but
fools
will
learn
in
no
other
the
founders
of
the
republic
were
not
fools
and
while
they
did
not
as
gladstone
seems
to
intimate
have
the
inspired
wisdom
to
develop
a
wonderful
constitution
by
sheer
intuition
unaided
by
experience
they
did
have
the
ability
to
make
of
their
very
errors
the
to
a
higher
destiny
by
the
articles
of
confederation
which
as
stated
became
effective
in
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
was
vested
in
the
new
government
which
was
also
given
the
power
to
create
admiralty
courts
regulate
coinage
maintain
an
army
and
navy
borrow
money
and
emit
bills
of
credit
but
the
great
limitation
was
that
in
all
other
respects
the
constituent
states
retained
absolute
power
especially
with
reference
to
commerce
and
taxation
all
that
the
central
government
could
do
was
to
requisition
the
states
to
furnish
food
supplies
and
the
states
were
then
left
to
impose
the
taxes
and
if
necessary
to
enforce
their
payment
in
their
own
way
with
the
inevitable
result
that
they
vied
with
each
other
in
the
struggle
to
evade
them
the
confederation
had
no
direct
power
over
the
citizens
of
the
several
states
moreover
the
congress
could
not
levy
any
taxes
or
indeed
pass
any
measure
unless
nine
out
of
the
thirteen
states
agreed
and
the
constitution
could
not
be
amended
except
by
unanimous
vote
while
the
congress
could
select
a
presiding
officer
to
serve
for
one
year
yet
he
had
no
real
executive
authority
during
the
recess
of
the
congress
a
committee
of
thirteen
consisting
of
one
delegate
from
each
state
had
powers
but
not
greater
than
the
congress
which
they
represented
such
a
government
would
have
been
fatal
to
any
people
and
so
it
nearly
proved
to
be
to
the
infant
nation
two
circumstances
saved
them
from
the
consequences
of
such
incapacity
one
was
the
invaluable
aid
of
france
and
the
other
the
personality
of
george
washington
of
this
great
leader
one
of
the
noblest
that
ever
lived
in
the
tide
of
time
it
is
only
necessary
to
quote
the
fine
tribute
paid
to
him
by
the
greatest
of
the
victorian
novelists
in
his
what
a
constancy
what
a
magnanimity
what
a
surprising
persistence
against
fortune
washington
the
chief
of
a
nation
in
arms
doing
battle
with
distracted
parties
calm
in
the
midst
of
conspiracy
serene
against
the
open
foe
before
him
and
the
darker
enemies
at
his
back
washington
inspiring
order
and
spirit
into
troops
hungry
and
in
rags
stung
by
ingratitude
but
betraying
no
anger
and
every
ready
to
forgive
in
defeat
invincible
magnanimous
in
conquest
and
never
so
sublime
as
on
that
day
when
he
laid
down
his
victorious
sword
and
sought
his
noble
retirement
here
indeed
is
a
character
to
admire
and
revere
a
life
without
a
stain
a
fame
without
a
flaw
a
year
after
the
articles
of
confederation
had
been
adopted
the
war
came
to
an
end
by
a
preliminary
treaty
on
november
now
follows
the
least
known
chapter
in
american
history
it
was
a
period
of
travail
of
which
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
present
american
nation
were
born
the
government
slowly
succumbed
from
its
own
weakness
to
its
inevitable
death
only
the
shreds
and
patches
of
authority
were
left
gradually
the
union
fell
apart
of
the
continental
congress
only
fifteen
members
representing
seven
colonies
remained
to
transact
the
affairs
of
the
new
nation
the
army
which
previously
to
the
termination
of
the
war
had
dissolved
by
the
hundreds
was
now
unpaid
and
in
a
stale
of
revolt
measure
after
measure
was
proposed
in
congress
to
raise
money
to
pay
the
interest
on
the
bonded
indebtedness
which
was
in
arrears
and
to
provide
funds
for
the
most
necessary
expenses
but
these
failed
in
congress
for
the
want
of
the
necessary
nine
votes
or
if
enacted
the
states
treated
the
requisitions
with
indifference
the
currency
of
the
united
states
had
fallen
almost
as
low
as
the
austrian
kronen
and
men
derisively
plastered
the
walls
of
their
houses
with
the
worthless
paper
of
the
continental
congress
adequate
authority
no
longer
remained
to
carry
out
the
terms
of
the
treaties
with
england
and
france
and
they
were
nullified
by
the
failure
of
the
infant
nation
to
comply
with
its
own
obligations
and
the
consequent
refusal
of
the
other
contracting
parties
to
comply
with
theirs
the
government
made
a
call
upon
the
states
to
raise
for
the
most
vital
needs
but
only
was
actually
received
then
congress
asked
the
states
to
vest
in
it
the
power
to
levy
a
tax
of
five
per
cent
on
imports
for
a
limited
period
but
after
waiting
two
years
for
the
action
of
the
states
less
than
nine
concurred
the
states
were
then
asked
to
pledge
their
own
internal
revenue
for
years
to
meet
the
national
indebtedness
but
this
could
only
be
done
by
unanimous
consent
and
while
twelve
states
concurred
rhode
island
refused
and
the
measure
was
defeated
it
was
again
the
infinite
folly
of
the
which
prior
to
the
great
partition
condemned
poland
to
chronic
anarchy
the
impotence
of
the
new
government
which
was
still
sitting
in
philadelphia
can
be
measured
by
the
fact
that
on
june
word
came
that
eighty
soldiers
were
on
their
way
to
philadelphia
to
demand
relief
they
stacked
their
arms
in
front
of
the
state
house
where
the
congress
was
then
sitting
and
refused
to
disband
when
requested
by
alexander
hamilton
as
the
representative
of
the
congress
to
do
so
when
congress
appealed
to
the
government
of
pennsylvania
for
protection
it
was
advised
that
the
pennsylvania
militia
was
likewise
insubordinate
the
congress
then
hastily
fled
by
night
and
became
a
fugitive
the
impotence
of
the
confederation
can
be
measured
by
the
fact
that
in
the
last
fourteen
months
of
its
existence
its
receipts
were
less
than
while
the
interest
on
the
foreign
debt
alone
was
over
and
the
interest
on
the
internal
debt
was
greater
in
the
absence
of
any
government
and
in
the
period
of
general
prostration
it
was
not
unnatural
that
the
spirit
of
bolshevism
grew
with
alarming
rapidity
it
even
permeated
the
officers
of
the
army
in
march
an
anonymous
communication
was
sent
to
washington
officers
to
meet
in
secret
conference
to
take
some
action
possibly
to
overthrow
the
government
a
copy
fell
into
washington
hands
and
while
he
forbade
the
assemblage
of
the
officers
under
the
anonymous
call
he
himself
directed
the
officers
to
assemble
he
unexpectedly
appeared
at
the
meeting
and
being
no
speaker
he
had
reduced
his
appeal
to
writing
as
he
adjusted
his
spectacles
to
read
it
he
pathetically
said
i
have
not
only
grown
gray
but
blind
in
your
service
he
then
made
a
touching
appeal
to
them
not
to
increase
by
example
the
spreading
spirit
of
revolt
the
very
sight
of
their
old
commander
turned
the
hearts
of
the
revolting
element
and
the
officers
remained
loyal
to
their
noble
leader
where
the
spirit
of
disaffection
was
thus
found
in
high
places
it
naturally
prevailed
more
widely
among
the
masses
who
had
been
driven
to
frenzy
by
their
sufferings
this
culminated
in
a
revolt
in
massachusetts
under
the
leadership
of
an
old
soldier
named
shays
and
it
spread
with
such
rapidity
that
not
only
did
of
the
people
join
in
attempting
to
overthrow
the
remnant
of
established
authority
in
massachusetts
but
it
rapidly
spread
to
other
states
the
offices
of
government
and
the
courthouses
were
seized
the
collection
of
debts
was
forbidden
and
private
property
was
forcibly
appropriated
to
meet
the
common
needs
chaos
had
come
again
it
filled
washington
heart
with
disgust
and
despair
after
surrendering
his
commission
to
the
pitiful
remnant
of
the
government
he
had
retired
to
mount
vernon
and
for
a
time
declined
to
act
further
as
the
leader
of
his
people
thus
in
october
he
wrote
james
warren
of
massachusetts
the
war
as
you
have
very
justly
observed
has
terminated
most
advantageously
for
america
and
a
fair
field
is
presented
to
our
view
but
i
confess
to
you
freely
my
dear
sir
that
i
do
not
think
we
possess
wisdom
or
justice
enough
to
cultivate
it
properly
illiberality
jealousy
and
local
policy
mix
too
much
in
all
our
public
councils
for
good
government
of
the
union
in
a
word
the
confederation
appears
to
me
to
be
little
more
than
a
shadow
without
the
substance
and
congress
a
nugatory
body
their
ordinances
being
little
attended
to
by
such
policy
as
this
the
wheels
of
government
are
clogged
and
our
brightest
prospects
and
that
high
expectation
which
was
entertained
of
us
by
the
wondering
world
are
turned
into
astonishment
and
from
the
high
ground
on
which
we
stood
we
are
descending
into
the
vale
of
confusion
and
darkness
again
he
wrote
to
george
mason
i
have
seen
without
despondency
even
for
a
moment
the
hours
which
america
has
styled
its
gloomy
ones
but
i
have
beheld
no
day
since
the
commencement
of
hostilities
that
i
thought
our
liberties
in
such
imminent
danger
as
at
present
indeed
we
are
verging
so
fast
to
destruction
that
i
am
feeling
that
sense
to
which
i
have
been
a
stranger
until
within
these
three
months
again
in
he
writes
i
think
often
of
our
situation
and
view
it
with
concern
from
the
high
ground
we
stood
upon
from
the
plain
path
which
invited
our
footsteps
to
be
so
fallen
so
lost
is
mortifying
but
everything
of
virtue
has
in
a
degree
taken
its
departure
from
our
land
what
gracious
god
is
man
that
there
should
be
such
inconsistency
and
perfidiousness
in
his
conduct
it
was
but
the
other
day
that
we
were
shedding
our
blood
to
obtain
the
constitutions
under
which
we
now
live
and
now
we
are
unsheathing
our
swords
to
overturn
them
the
thing
is
so
unaccountable
that
i
hardly
know
how
to
realize
it
or
to
persuade
myself
that
i
am
not
under
an
illusion
of
a
dream
it
was
however
the
darkest
hour
before
the
dawn
and
again
it
was
washington
who
became
his
country
saviour
in
some
commissioners
from
the
states
of
virginia
and
maryland
visited
mount
vernon
to
pay
their
respects
to
the
commander
after
conferring
with
him
upon
the
chaos
of
the
times
they
decided
to
issue
a
call
for
a
general
conference
of
the
representatives
of
the
states
to
be
held
on
september
at
annapolis
maryland
to
discuss
how
far
the
states
themselves
could
agree
on
common
regulations
of
commerce
at
the
appointed
time
the
delegates
assembled
from
virginia
pennsylvania
delaware
new
york
and
new
jersey
and
finding
themselves
too
few
in
number
to
achieve
the
great
objective
the
convention
contented
itself
by
issuing
another
call
drafted
by
alexander
hamilton
then
under
thirty
years
of
age
to
all
the
states
to
send
delegates
to
a
convention
to
be
held
in
philadelphia
on
the
second
monday
in
may
to
take
into
consideration
the
situation
of
the
united
states
to
devise
such
further
provisions
as
should
appear
to
them
necessary
to
render
the
constitution
of
the
federal
government
adequate
to
the
exigencies
of
the
union
the
dying
congress
tardily
approved
of
this
suggestion
but
finally
on
january
grudgingly
adopted
a
resolution
that
it
is
expedient
that
on
the
second
monday
in
may
next
a
convention
of
delegates
who
shall
have
been
appointed
by
the
several
states
be
held
at
philadelphia
the
sole
and
express
purpose
of
revising
the
articles
of
and
reporting
to
congress
and
the
several
legislatures
such
alterations
and
provisions
therein
as
shall
agreed
to
in
and
conformed
to
by
the
states
render
the
federal
constitution
adequate
to
the
exigency
of
the
government
and
the
preservation
of
the
union
it
will
be
noted
by
the
italicized
portions
of
the
resolution
that
this
impotent
body
thus
vainly
attempted
to
cling
to
the
shadow
of
its
vanished
authority
by
stating
that
the
proposed
constitutional
convention
should
merely
revise
the
worthless
articles
of
confederation
and
that
such
amendments
should
not
have
validity
until
adopted
by
congress
as
well
as
by
the
people
of
the
several
states
how
this
mandate
was
disregarded
and
how
the
convention
was
formed
and
proceeded
to
create
a
new
government
with
a
new
constitution
and
how
it
achieved
its
mighty
work
will
be
the
subject
of
the
next
lecture
anticipating
the
masterly
ability
with
which
a
seemingly
impotent
and
dying
nation
plucked
from
the
nettle
of
danger
the
flower
of
safety
let
me
conclude
this
first
address
by
quoting
the
words
of
de
tocqueville
in
his
remarkable
work
in
where
he
says
the
federal
government
condemned
to
impotence
by
its
constitution
and
no
longer
sustained
by
the
presence
of
common
danger
was
already
on
the
verge
of
destruction
when
it
officially
proclaimed
its
inability
to
conduct
the
government
and
appealed
to
the
constituent
authority
of
the
nation
it
is
a
novelty
in
the
history
of
a
society
to
see
a
calm
and
scrutinizing
eye
turned
upon
itself
when
apprised
by
the
legislature
that
the
wheels
of
government
are
stopped
to
see
it
carefully
examine
the
extent
of
the
field
and
patiently
wait
for
two
years
until
a
remedy
was
discovered
which
it
voluntarily
adopted
without
having
ever
wrung
a
tear
or
a
drop
of
blood
from
mankind
the
great
now
follows
a
notable
and
yet
little
known
scene
in
the
drama
of
history
it
reveals
a
people
who
without
shedding
a
drop
of
blood
calmly
and
deliberately
abolished
one
government
substituted
another
and
erected
it
upon
foundations
which
have
hitherto
proved
enduring
even
the
superstructure
slowly
erected
upon
these
foundations
has
suffered
little
change
in
the
most
changing
period
of
the
history
and
until
recently
its
additions
few
in
number
have
varied
little
from
the
plans
of
the
original
architects
the
constitution
is
not
a
ruined
parthenon
but
rather
as
one
of
those
gothic
masterpieces
against
which
the
storms
of
passionate
strife
have
beaten
in
vain
the
foundations
were
laid
at
a
time
when
disorder
was
rampant
and
anarchy
widely
prevalent
as
i
have
already
shown
in
my
first
lecture
credit
was
gone
business
paralysed
lawlessness
triumphant
and
not
only
between
class
and
class
but
between
state
and
state
there
were
acute
controversies
and
an
alarming
disunity
of
spirit
to
weld
thirteen
jealous
and
discordant
states
demoralized
by
an
exhausting
war
into
a
unified
and
efficient
nation
against
their
wills
was
a
seemingly
impossible
task
frederick
the
great
had
said
that
a
federal
union
of
widely
scattered
communities
was
impossible
its
final
accomplishment
has
blinded
the
world
to
the
essential
difficulty
of
the
problem
the
time
was
may
the
place
the
state
house
in
philadelphia
a
little
town
of
not
more
than
people
and
at
that
time
as
remote
measured
by
the
facilities
of
communication
to
the
centres
of
civilization
as
is
now
vladivostok
the
in
this
drama
though
few
in
numbers
were
however
worthy
of
the
task
had
originally
been
offered
or
given
credentials
for
each
state
was
permitted
to
send
as
many
delegates
as
it
pleased
inasmuch
as
the
states
were
to
vote
in
the
convention
as
units
of
these
the
greatest
actual
attendance
was
and
at
the
end
of
the
convention
a
saving
remnant
of
only
remained
to
finish
a
work
which
was
to
immortalize
its
participants
while
this
notable
group
of
men
contained
a
few
merchants
financiers
farmers
doctors
educators
and
soldiers
of
the
remainder
at
least
were
lawyers
and
of
these
many
had
been
justices
of
the
local
courts
and
executive
officers
of
the
commonwealths
four
had
studied
in
the
inner
temple
at
least
five
in
the
middle
temple
one
at
oxford
under
the
tuition
of
blackstone
and
two
in
scottish
universities
few
of
them
were
inexperienced
in
public
affairs
for
of
the
original
members
had
been
members
of
the
first
or
second
continental
congresses
and
eight
had
already
helped
to
frame
the
constitutions
of
their
respective
states
at
least
were
college
graduates
of
whom
nine
were
graduates
of
princeton
three
of
yale
two
of
harvard
four
of
william
and
mary
and
one
each
from
the
universities
of
oxford
columbia
glasgow
and
edinburgh
a
few
already
enjoyed
fame
notably
doctor
franklin
possibly
the
most
versatile
genius
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
universally
known
and
honoured
as
a
scientist
philosopher
and
diplomat
and
george
washington
whose
fame
even
at
that
day
had
filled
the
world
with
the
noble
purity
of
his
character
it
was
a
convention
of
comparatively
young
men
the
average
age
being
little
above
forty
franklin
was
the
oldest
member
being
then
dayton
the
youngest
being
with
the
exception
of
franklin
and
washington
most
of
the
potential
personalities
in
the
convention
were
under
forty
thus
james
madison
who
contributed
so
largely
to
the
plan
that
he
is
sometimes
called
the
father
of
the
constitution
was
charles
pinckney
who
unaided
submitted
the
first
concrete
draft
of
the
constitution
was
only
and
alexander
hamilton
who
was
destined
to
take
a
leading
part
in
securing
its
ratification
by
his
powerful
oratory
and
his
very
able
commentaries
in
the
federalist
papers
was
only
thirty
above
all
they
were
a
group
of
gentlemen
of
substance
and
honour
who
could
debate
for
four
months
during
the
depressing
weather
of
a
hot
summer
without
losing
their
tempers
except
momentarily
and
this
despite
vital
differences
and
who
showed
that
genius
for
toleration
and
reconciliation
of
conflicting
views
inspired
by
a
common
fidelity
to
a
great
objective
that
is
the
highest
mark
of
statesmanship
they
represented
the
spirit
of
representative
government
at
its
best
in
avoiding
the
cowardice
of
and
the
low
cunning
of
demagogues
all
apparently
were
inspired
by
a
fine
spirit
of
selfish
ambition
was
conspicuously
absent
they
differed
at
times
heatedly
but
always
as
gentlemen
of
candour
and
honour
the
very
secrecy
of
their
deliberations
of
which
i
shall
presently
speak
is
ample
proof
how
indifferent
they
were
to
popular
applause
and
the
ardor
prava
the
convention
had
been
slow
in
assembling
ample
notice
had
been
given
that
it
would
convene
on
may
but
when
that
day
arrived
a
mere
handful
of
the
delegates
less
than
a
quorum
had
assembled
the
virginia
delegation
six
in
number
and
forming
probably
the
ablest
delegation
from
any
state
arriving
in
time
and
failing
to
find
a
quorum
then
assembled
employed
the
period
of
waiting
in
submitting
to
the
pennsylvania
delegation
the
outlines
of
a
plan
for
the
new
constitution
the
plan
was
largely
the
work
of
james
madison
and
how
long
it
had
been
in
preparation
can
not
be
definitely
stated
it
is
clear
that
four
years
before
a
philadelphia
merchant
one
peletiah
webster
had
published
a
brochure
proposing
a
scheme
of
dual
sovereignty
under
which
the
citizens
would
owe
a
double
allegiance
one
to
the
constituent
states
within
the
sphere
of
their
reserved
powers
and
one
to
a
federated
government
within
the
sphere
of
its
delegated
powers
leagues
of
states
had
often
existed
but
a
league
which
within
a
prescribed
sphere
would
have
direct
authority
over
the
citizens
of
the
constituent
states
without
however
abolishing
the
authority
of
such
states
as
to
their
reserved
sphere
of
power
was
a
novel
theory
how
far
the
virginia
project
had
been
influenced
by
webster
suggestion
is
not
clear
but
it
is
certain
that
before
the
convention
met
pennsylvania
and
virginia
two
of
the
most
powerful
states
were
committed
to
it
the
suggestion
was
a
radical
one
for
the
states
with
few
exceptions
were
chiefly
insistent
upon
the
preservation
of
their
sovereignty
and
while
they
were
willing
to
amend
the
articles
of
confederation
by
giving
fuller
authority
to
the
central
government
such
as
it
was
the
suggestion
of
subordinating
the
states
to
a
new
sovereign
power
whose
authority
within
circumscribed
limits
was
to
be
supreme
was
opposed
to
all
their
conventions
and
traditions
washington
however
had
warmly
welcomed
the
creation
of
a
strong
central
government
and
his
correspondence
with
the
leading
men
of
the
colonies
for
some
years
previously
had
been
burdened
with
arguments
to
convince
them
that
a
mere
league
of
states
would
not
suffice
to
create
a
stable
nation
to
george
washington
soldier
and
statesman
is
due
above
all
men
the
ideal
of
a
federated
union
for
without
his
influence
that
of
a
noble
and
unselfish
leader
the
great
result
would
probably
never
have
been
secured
while
still
waiting
for
the
convention
to
meet
and
while
discussing
what
was
expedient
and
practicable
when
they
did
meet
washington
one
day
said
to
a
group
of
delegates
who
were
considering
the
acute
nature
of
the
crisis
it
is
too
probable
that
no
plan
that
we
propose
will
be
adopted
perhaps
another
dreadful
conflict
is
to
be
sustained
if
to
please
the
people
we
offer
what
we
ourselves
disapprove
how
can
we
afterwards
defend
our
work
let
us
raise
a
standard
to
which
the
wise
and
just
can
repair
the
event
is
in
the
hand
of
god
noble
words
fit
to
be
written
in
letters
of
gold
over
the
portal
of
every
legislature
of
the
world
and
it
was
in
this
spirit
that
the
convention
finally
convened
on
may
when
the
delegates
from
nine
states
had
assembled
washington
was
unanimously
elected
the
presiding
officer
of
the
convention
it
began
by
adopting
rules
of
order
and
the
most
significant
of
these
was
the
provision
for
secrecy
no
copy
should
be
taken
of
any
entry
on
the
journal
or
even
permission
given
to
inspect
it
without
leave
of
the
convention
and
nothing
spoken
in
the
house
be
printed
or
otherwise
published
or
communicated
without
leave
the
yeas
and
nays
should
not
be
recorded
the
rule
of
secrecy
was
enlarged
by
an
unwritten
understanding
that
even
when
the
convention
had
adjourned
no
disclosure
should
be
made
of
its
proceedings
during
the
life
of
its
members
when
after
nearly
four
months
the
convention
adjourned
the
secret
had
been
kept
and
no
one
knew
even
the
concrete
result
of
its
deliberations
until
the
constitution
itself
and
nothing
else
was
offered
to
the
approval
of
the
people
the
upon
which
the
state
house
fronted
was
covered
with
earth
to
deaden
the
noise
of
traffic
and
sentries
were
posted
at
every
means
of
ingress
and
egress
to
prevent
any
intrusion
upon
the
privacy
of
the
convention
the
members
were
not
photographed
daily
for
the
pictorial
press
nor
did
any
cinema
register
their
entrance
into
the
simple
colonial
hall
where
they
were
to
meet
notwithstanding
this
limitation
for
no
conference
or
assembly
can
proceed
with
its
labours
until
its
members
are
photographed
for
the
curiosity
of
the
public
these
gentlemen
less
intent
upon
their
appearance
than
their
task
were
to
accomplish
a
work
of
enduring
importance
the
extreme
care
which
was
taken
to
preserve
this
secrecy
inviolate
and
its
purpose
were
indicated
in
an
incident
handed
down
by
tradition
one
of
the
members
dropped
a
copy
of
a
proposition
then
before
the
convention
for
consideration
and
it
was
found
by
another
of
the
delegates
and
handed
to
general
washington
at
the
conclusion
of
the
session
washington
arose
and
sternly
reprimanded
the
member
for
his
carelessness
by
saying
i
must
entreat
gentlemen
to
be
more
careful
lest
our
transactions
get
into
the
newspapers
and
disturb
the
public
repose
by
premature
speculations
i
know
not
whose
paper
it
is
but
there
it
is
it
down
on
the
let
him
who
owns
it
take
it
he
then
bowed
picked
up
his
hat
and
left
the
room
with
such
evidences
of
annoyance
that
like
no
delegate
was
willing
to
admit
the
ownership
of
the
paper
the
thought
suggests
itself
how
different
the
result
at
versailles
and
genoa
might
have
been
had
there
been
the
same
reasonable
provisions
for
discussion
and
action
uninfluenced
by
too
premature
public
comment
of
the
day
in
these
days
when
representative
government
has
degenerated
into
government
by
a
fleeting
public
opinion
the
price
we
pay
for
such
government
by
for
and
of
the
press
is
too
often
the
inability
of
representatives
to
do
what
they
deem
wise
and
just
at
the
close
of
the
convention
its
records
were
committed
into
the
keeping
of
washington
with
instructions
to
retain
the
journal
and
other
papers
subject
to
order
of
congress
if
ever
formed
under
the
constitution
even
the
journal
consisted
of
little
more
than
daily
memoranda
from
which
the
minutes
ought
to
have
been
but
never
were
made
and
these
fragmentary
records
of
the
proceedings
of
a
convention
which
had
been
in
continuous
session
for
nearly
four
months
were
never
published
until
the
year
or
years
after
the
close
of
the
convention
thus
the
american
people
knew
nothing
of
their
greatest
convention
until
a
generation
later
and
then
only
a
few
bones
of
the
mastodon
were
exhibited
to
their
curious
gaze
the
members
of
the
convention
kept
its
secrets
inviolate
for
many
years
with
few
exceptions
the
great
secrets
of
the
convention
died
with
them
only
one
james
madison
left
a
comprehensive
statement
of
the
more
formal
proceedings
with
this
notable
exception
only
a
few
anecdotes
handed
down
by
tradition
escaped
oblivion
the
first
of
the
number
to
break
the
pledge
of
secrecy
was
robert
yates
chief
justice
of
new
york
who
in
published
his
recollections
but
as
he
had
left
the
convention
a
few
months
after
it
began
his
notes
ceased
with
the
of
july
the
world
would
thus
have
been
for
ever
ignorant
of
the
details
of
one
of
the
most
remarkable
conventions
in
the
annals
of
mankind
had
it
not
been
that
one
of
the
ablest
of
their
number
james
madison
regularly
attended
the
sessions
and
kept
notes
from
day
to
day
of
the
debates
while
he
was
not
a
stenographer
he
had
a
gift
for
condensing
a
speech
and
fairly
representing
its
substance
he
jealously
guarded
his
journal
of
the
convention
until
his
death
its
very
existence
was
known
to
few
he
died
in
and
four
years
later
the
government
purchased
the
manuscript
from
his
widow
then
for
the
first
time
the
curtain
was
measurably
raised
upon
the
proceedings
of
a
convention
which
had
created
as
we
now
know
one
of
the
greatest
nations
in
history
years
after
the
close
of
the
convention
and
when
nearly
every
one
of
its
participants
were
dead
madison
journal
was
first
published
when
was
a
great
secret
better
kept
grateful
as
posterity
must
be
for
this
inestimable
gift
of
great
human
enterprise
yet
even
careful
journal
fills
one
with
the
deepest
regret
that
this
wonderful
debate
which
lasted
for
nearly
four
months
between
men
of
no
ordinary
ability
could
not
have
been
preserved
to
the
world
two
or
three
of
the
speeches
which
madison
gives
in
his
journal
are
complete
for
when
doctor
franklin
spoke
he
reduced
his
remarks
to
writing
and
gave
a
copy
to
madison
but
of
the
other
speeches
only
a
fragrant
remains
thus
that
admirable
crichton
alexander
hamilton
addressed
the
convention
in
a
speech
that
lasted
five
hours
in
which
he
stated
his
philosophy
of
government
but
of
that
only
a
short
condensation
and
possibly
not
even
an
accurate
fragment
remains
without
this
extraordinary
provision
for
secrecy
which
is
so
opposed
to
modern
democratic
conventions
and
which
so
little
resembles
the
famous
point
as
to
open
covenants
openly
arrived
at
the
convention
could
not
have
accomplished
its
great
work
for
these
wise
men
realized
that
a
statesman
can
not
act
wisely
under
the
observation
of
a
gallery
and
especially
when
the
gallery
compels
him
by
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
to
work
as
it
directs
i
recognize
that
public
opinion
often
temporarily
uninformed
but
in
the
end
generally
right
does
often
save
the
democracies
of
the
world
from
the
selfish
ends
of
and
misguided
leadership
but
given
noble
and
wise
representatives
they
work
best
when
least
influenced
by
the
fleeting
passions
of
the
day
it
is
evident
that
if
the
framers
of
the
constitution
had
met
as
similar
conventions
have
within
recent
years
met
at
versailles
and
genoa
with
the
world
as
their
gallery
and
with
the
representatives
of
the
press
as
an
integral
part
of
the
conference
they
would
have
accomplished
nothing
the
probability
is
that
the
convention
would
not
have
lasted
a
month
if
their
immediate
purpose
had
been
to
placate
current
opinion
it
may
be
doubted
whether
such
a
convention
if
called
either
in
your
country
or
mine
could
achieve
like
results
for
in
this
day
of
unlimited
publicity
when
men
divide
not
as
individuals
but
in
powerful
and
organized
groups
a
constitutional
convention
would
i
fear
prove
a
witches
cauldron
of
class
legislation
and
demagoguery
is
it
not
possible
that
modern
democracy
is
in
danger
of
strangulation
by
its
methods
and
ideals
again
the
words
of
washington
suggest
themselves
if
to
please
the
people
we
offer
what
we
ourselves
disapprove
how
can
we
afterwards
defend
our
work
let
us
raise
a
standard
to
which
the
wise
and
just
can
repair
working
with
a
sad
sincerity
and
with
despair
in
their
hearts
this
little
band
of
men
wrought
a
work
of
surpassing
importance
and
if
they
did
not
receive
the
immediate
plaudits
of
the
living
generation
their
shades
can
at
least
solace
themselves
with
the
reflection
that
posterity
has
acclaimed
their
work
as
one
of
the
greatest
political
achievements
of
man
the
rules
of
order
and
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
thus
determined
the
convention
opened
by
an
address
by
randolph
of
virginia
in
which
he
submitted
in
the
form
of
fifteen
points
nearly
the
number
of
the
fatal
fourteen
the
outlines
for
a
new
government
he
himself
in
his
opening
speech
summarized
the
propositions
by
candidly
confessing
that
they
were
not
intended
for
a
federal
government
thereby
meaning
a
mere
league
of
states
but
a
strong
consolidated
union
upon
this
radical
change
the
convention
was
to
argue
earnestly
and
at
times
bitterly
for
many
a
weary
day
the
plan
provided
for
a
national
legislature
of
which
the
lower
branch
should
be
elected
by
the
people
and
the
upper
branch
by
the
lower
branch
upon
the
nomination
of
the
legislatures
of
the
states
this
legislature
should
enjoy
all
the
legislative
rights
given
to
the
federation
and
there
followed
the
sweeping
grant
that
it
could
legislate
in
all
cases
to
which
the
separate
states
are
incompetent
or
in
which
the
harmony
of
the
united
states
may
be
interrupted
by
the
exercise
of
individual
legislation
with
power
to
negative
all
laws
passed
by
the
several
states
contravening
in
the
opinion
of
the
national
legislature
the
articles
of
the
union
a
national
executive
was
proposed
together
with
a
national
judiciary
and
these
two
bodies
were
given
authority
to
examine
every
act
of
the
national
legislature
before
it
shall
operate
and
every
act
of
a
particular
legislature
before
a
negative
thereon
shall
be
final
this
marked
an
immense
advance
over
the
articles
of
confederation
under
which
there
was
no
national
executive
or
judiciary
and
under
which
the
legislature
had
no
direct
power
over
the
citizens
of
the
states
and
could
only
impose
duties
upon
the
states
themselves
by
the
concurrence
of
nine
of
the
thirteen
hardly
had
randolph
submitted
the
virginia
plan
when
charles
pinckney
of
south
carolina
a
young
man
of
years
of
age
with
the
courage
of
youth
submitted
to
the
house
a
draft
of
the
future
federal
government
curiously
enough
it
did
not
differ
in
principle
from
the
virginia
plan
but
was
more
specific
and
concrete
in
stating
the
powers
which
the
federal
government
should
exercise
and
many
of
its
provisions
were
embodied
in
the
final
draft
indeed
pinckney
plan
was
the
future
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
embryo
and
when
it
is
read
and
contrasted
with
the
document
which
has
so
justly
won
the
acclaim
of
men
throughout
the
world
it
is
amazing
that
so
young
a
man
should
have
anticipated
and
reduced
to
a
concrete
and
effective
form
many
of
the
most
novel
features
of
the
federal
government
as
the
only
copy
of
pinckney
plan
was
furnished
years
afterwards
to
madison
for
his
journal
it
is
possible
that
some
of
its
wisdom
was
of
the
variety
having
received
the
two
plans
the
convention
then
went
on
may
into
a
committee
of
the
whole
to
consider
the
fifteen
propositions
in
the
virginia
plan
they
wisely
concluded
to
determine
abstract
ideas
first
and
concrete
forms
later
apparently
for
the
time
being
little
attention
was
paid
to
pinckney
plan
and
this
may
have
been
due
to
the
hostile
attitude
of
the
older
members
of
the
convention
to
the
presumption
of
his
youth
then
ensued
a
very
remarkable
debate
on
the
immediate
propositions
and
the
principles
of
government
which
underlay
them
which
lasted
for
two
weeks
on
june
the
committee
rose
even
the
fragments
of
this
debate
which
may
well
have
been
one
of
the
most
notable
in
history
indicate
the
care
with
which
the
members
had
studied
governments
of
ancient
and
modern
times
there
were
many
points
of
difference
but
chief
of
them
which
nearly
resulted
in
the
collapse
of
the
convention
was
the
inevitable
difficulty
which
always
arises
in
the
formation
of
a
league
of
states
or
an
association
of
nations
between
the
great
and
the
little
states
the
five
larger
states
had
a
population
that
was
nearly
twice
as
great
as
the
remaining
eight
states
thus
virginia
population
was
nearly
as
great
as
georgia
moreover
the
states
differed
greatly
in
their
material
wealth
and
power
nevertheless
all
of
them
entered
the
convention
as
independent
sovereign
nations
and
the
smaller
nations
contended
that
the
equality
in
suffrage
and
political
power
which
prevailed
in
the
convention
in
which
each
state
large
or
small
voted
as
a
unit
should
and
must
be
preserved
in
the
future
government
to
this
the
larger
states
were
quite
unwilling
to
yield
and
when
the
committee
rose
they
reported
in
substance
the
virginia
plan
with
the
proviso
that
representation
in
the
proposed
congress
should
be
according
to
some
equitable
ratio
of
representation
on
june
the
small
states
presented
their
draft
which
was
afterwards
known
as
the
new
jersey
plan
because
it
was
introduced
by
patterson
of
that
state
it
only
contemplated
an
amendment
to
the
existing
constitution
and
an
amplification
of
the
powers
of
the
impotent
confederation
its
chief
advance
over
the
existing
government
was
that
it
provided
for
a
federal
executive
and
a
federal
judiciary
but
otherwise
the
government
remained
a
mere
league
of
states
in
which
the
central
government
could
generally
act
only
by
the
vote
of
nine
states
and
in
which
their
power
was
exhausted
when
they
requested
the
states
to
enforce
the
decrees
its
chief
advance
over
the
articles
of
confederation
in
addition
to
the
creation
of
an
executive
was
an
assertion
that
the
acts
of
congress
shall
be
the
supreme
law
of
the
respective
states
and
that
the
judiciary
of
the
several
states
shall
be
bound
thereby
in
their
decisions
and
that
if
any
state
or
any
body
of
men
in
any
state
shall
oppose
or
prevent
the
carrying
into
execution
of
such
acts
or
treaties
the
federal
executive
shall
be
authorized
to
call
forth
the
power
of
the
confederated
states
to
enforce
and
compel
obedience
to
such
acts
or
an
observance
of
such
treaties
while
this
was
some
advance
toward
a
truly
national
government
it
yet
left
the
national
executive
dependent
upon
the
constituent
states
for
if
they
failed
to
respond
to
the
call
above
stated
the
national
government
had
no
direct
power
over
their
citizens
the
new
jersey
plan
precipitated
a
crisis
and
thereafter
and
for
many
days
the
argument
proceeded
only
to
increase
in
bitterness
on
june
alexander
hamilton
who
agreed
with
no
one
else
addressed
the
convention
for
the
first
time
he
spoke
for
five
hours
and
reviewed
exhaustively
the
virginia
and
new
jersey
plans
and
possibly
the
pinckney
draft
even
the
fragment
of
the
speech
as
taken
in
by
madison
shows
that
it
was
a
masterly
argument
he
stated
his
belief
that
the
british
government
was
the
best
in
the
world
and
that
he
doubted
much
whether
anything
short
of
it
would
do
in
america
he
praised
the
british
constitution
quoting
monsieur
necker
as
saying
that
it
was
the
only
government
in
the
world
which
unites
government
strength
with
individual
security
he
analysed
and
explained
your
constitution
as
it
then
was
and
advocated
an
elective
monarchy
in
form
though
not
in
name
it
is
true
that
he
called
the
executive
a
governor
and
not
a
king
but
the
governor
was
to
serve
for
life
and
was
given
not
only
a
negative
on
all
laws
about
to
be
passed
but
even
the
execution
of
all
duly
enacted
laws
was
in
his
discretion
the
governor
with
the
consent
of
the
senate
was
to
make
war
conclude
all
treaties
make
all
appointments
pardon
all
offences
with
the
full
power
through
his
negative
of
saying
what
laws
should
be
passed
and
which
enforced
hamilton
governor
would
have
been
not
dissimilar
to
louis
xiv
and
could
have
said
with
him
the
senate
also
served
for
life
and
the
only
concession
which
hamilton
made
to
democracy
was
an
elective
house
of
representatives
thinly
veiled
his
plan
contemplated
an
elective
king
with
greater
powers
than
those
of
george
iii
an
imitation
house
of
lords
and
a
popular
house
of
commons
with
a
limited
tenure
hamilton
plan
was
never
taken
seriously
and
so
far
as
the
records
show
was
never
afterwards
considered
his
admirers
have
given
great
praise
to
his
work
in
the
federal
convention
his
real
contribution
lay
in
the
fact
that
when
the
constitution
was
finally
drafted
and
offered
to
the
people
while
he
regarded
it
as
a
wretched
makeshift
to
use
his
own
expression
yet
he
was
broad
and
patriotic
enough
to
surrender
his
own
views
and
advocate
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
in
so
doing
he
fought
a
valorous
fight
secured
the
acquiescence
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
without
its
ratification
the
constitution
would
never
have
been
adopted
hamilton
later
thought
better
of
the
constitution
and
its
successful
beginning
is
due
in
large
measure
to
his
genius
for
constructive
administration
as
the
debate
proceeded
the
crisis
precipitated
by
the
seemingly
insoluble
differences
between
the
great
and
little
states
became
more
acute
the
smaller
states
contended
that
the
convention
was
transgressing
its
powers
and
they
demanded
that
the
credentials
of
the
various
members
be
read
in
this
there
was
technical
accuracy
for
the
delegates
had
been
appointed
to
revise
the
articles
of
confederation
and
not
to
adopt
a
new
constitution
a
majority
of
the
convention
however
insisted
upon
the
convention
proceeding
with
the
consideration
of
a
new
constitution
and
their
views
prevailed
it
speaks
well
for
the
honour
of
the
delegates
that
although
their
differences
became
so
acute
as
to
lead
at
times
to
bitter
expressions
neither
side
divulged
them
to
the
outside
public
the
smaller
states
could
easily
have
ended
the
convention
by
an
appeal
to
public
opinion
which
was
not
then
prepared
for
a
consolidated
union
but
they
were
loyal
enough
to
fight
out
their
quarrels
within
the
walls
of
the
convention
hall
at
times
the
debate
became
bitter
in
the
extreme
james
wilson
a
delegate
of
pennsylvania
and
a
scotchman
by
birth
and
education
turning
to
the
representatives
of
the
little
states
passionately
said
will
you
abandon
a
country
to
which
you
are
bound
by
so
many
strong
and
enduring
ties
should
the
event
happen
it
will
neither
stagger
my
sentiments
nor
duty
if
the
minority
of
the
people
refuse
to
coalesce
with
the
majority
on
just
and
proper
principles
if
a
separation
must
take
place
it
could
never
happen
on
better
grounds
he
referred
to
the
demand
of
the
larger
states
that
representation
should
be
proportioned
to
the
population
to
this
bedford
of
delaware
as
heatedly
replied
we
have
been
told
with
a
dictatorial
air
that
this
is
the
last
moment
for
a
fair
trial
in
favour
of
good
government
it
will
be
the
last
indeed
if
the
propositions
reported
by
the
committee
go
forth
to
the
people
the
large
states
dare
not
dissolve
the
convention
if
they
do
the
small
ones
will
find
some
foreign
ally
of
more
honour
and
good
faith
who
will
take
them
by
the
hand
and
do
them
justice
finally
the
smaller
states
gave
their
ultimatum
to
the
larger
states
that
unless
representation
in
both
branches
of
the
proposed
legislature
should
be
on
the
basis
of
equality
each
state
whether
large
or
small
having
one
vote
they
would
forthwith
leave
the
convention
an
says
that
at
that
moment
washington
who
was
in
the
chair
gave
old
doctor
franklin
a
significant
look
franklin
arose
and
moved
an
adjournment
for
hours
with
the
understanding
that
the
delegates
should
confer
with
those
with
whom
they
disagreed
rather
than
with
those
with
whom
they
agreed
a
recess
was
taken
and
when
the
convention
on
july
a
vote
was
taken
as
to
equality
of
representation
in
the
senate
and
resulted
in
a
tie
vote
it
was
then
decided
to
appoint
a
committee
of
eleven
one
from
each
state
to
consider
the
question
and
this
committee
reported
three
days
later
on
july
in
favour
of
proportionate
representation
in
the
house
and
equal
representation
in
the
senate
this
suggestion
which
finally
saved
the
situation
was
due
to
that
wise
old
utilitarian
philosopher
franklin
again
a
vehement
and
passionate
debate
followed
vague
references
were
made
to
the
sword
as
the
only
method
of
solving
the
difference
on
july
the
committee
again
reported
maintaining
the
principle
of
their
recommendation
while
modifying
its
details
and
the
debate
then
turned
upon
the
question
to
what
extent
the
negro
slaves
should
count
in
estimating
population
for
the
purposes
of
proportionate
representation
in
the
lower
house
various
suggestions
were
made
to
base
representation
upon
wealth
or
taxation
and
not
upon
population
for
several
days
the
debate
lasted
during
very
heated
weather
but
on
the
night
of
july
the
temperature
dropped
and
with
it
the
emotional
temperature
of
the
delegates
some
days
previous
namely
june
when
the
debates
were
becoming
so
bitter
that
it
seemed
unlikely
that
the
convention
could
continue
doctor
franklin
erroneously
supposed
by
many
to
be
an
atheist
made
the
following
solemn
and
beautiful
appeal
to
their
better
natures
he
said
the
small
progress
we
have
made
after
four
or
five
weeks
close
attendance
and
continual
reasonings
with
each
other
our
different
sentiments
on
almost
every
question
several
of
the
last
producing
as
many
noes
as
ayes
is
methinks
a
melancholy
proof
of
the
imperfection
of
the
human
understanding
we
indeed
seem
to
feel
our
own
want
of
political
wisdom
since
we
have
been
running
about
in
search
of
it
we
have
gone
back
to
ancient
history
for
models
of
government
and
examined
the
different
forms
of
those
republics
which
having
been
formed
with
the
seeds
of
their
own
dissolution
now
no
longer
exist
and
we
have
viewed
modern
states
all
around
europe
but
find
none
of
their
constitutions
suitable
to
our
circumstances
in
this
situation
of
this
assembly
groping
as
it
were
in
the
dark
to
find
political
truth
and
scarce
able
to
distinguish
it
when
presented
to
us
how
has
it
happened
sir
that
we
have
not
hitherto
once
thought
of
humbly
applying
to
the
father
of
lights
to
illuminate
our
understandings
and
have
we
now
forgotten
that
powerful
friend
or
do
we
imagine
that
we
no
longer
need
his
assistance
i
have
lived
sir
a
long
time
and
the
longer
i
live
the
more
convincing
proofs
i
see
of
this
truth
that
governs
in
the
affairs
of
and
if
a
sparrow
can
not
fall
to
the
ground
without
his
notice
is
it
probable
that
an
empire
can
rise
without
his
aid
we
have
been
assured
sir
in
the
sacred
writings
that
the
lord
build
the
house
they
labour
in
vain
that
build
it
i
firmly
believe
this
and
i
also
believe
that
without
his
concurring
aid
we
shall
succeed
in
this
political
building
no
better
than
the
builders
of
babel
we
shall
be
divided
by
our
little
partial
local
interests
our
projects
will
be
confounded
and
we
ourselves
shall
become
a
reproach
and
byword
down
to
future
ages
and
what
is
worse
mankind
may
hereafter
from
this
unfortunate
instance
despair
of
establishing
governments
by
human
wisdom
and
leave
it
to
chance
war
and
conquest
i
therefore
beg
leave
to
move
that
henceforth
prayers
imploring
the
assistance
of
heaven
and
its
blessings
on
our
deliberations
be
held
in
this
assembly
every
morning
before
we
proceed
to
business
and
that
one
or
more
of
the
clergy
of
this
city
be
requested
to
officiate
in
that
service
it
may
surprise
my
audience
to
know
the
sequel
the
resolution
was
voted
down
partly
on
the
ground
that
if
it
became
known
to
the
public
that
the
convention
had
finally
resorted
to
prayers
it
might
cause
undue
alarm
but
also
because
the
convention
was
by
that
time
so
low
in
funds
that
as
one
of
the
members
said
it
did
not
have
enough
money
to
pay
a
clergyman
his
fees
for
the
service
i
suspect
that
their
controlling
reason
was
their
indisposition
to
break
their
rule
of
secrecy
by
contact
with
the
outer
world
until
their
work
was
completed
perhaps
they
thought
that
god
helps
those
who
help
themselves
on
july
the
compromise
was
finally
adopted
of
recognizing
the
claims
of
the
larger
states
to
proportionate
representation
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
recognizing
the
claims
of
the
smaller
states
by
according
to
them
equal
representation
in
the
senate
this
great
result
was
not
effected
without
the
first
break
in
the
convention
for
the
delegates
from
new
york
left
in
disgust
and
never
returned
with
the
exception
of
hamilton
who
occasionally
attended
subsequent
sessions
such
was
the
great
concession
that
was
made
to
secure
the
constitution
and
the
only
respect
in
which
the
constitution
can
not
be
amended
is
that
by
express
provision
the
equality
of
representation
in
the
senate
shall
never
be
disturbed
thus
it
is
that
some
states
which
have
less
population
than
some
of
the
wards
in
the
city
of
new
york
have
as
many
votes
in
the
senate
as
the
great
state
of
new
york
it
is
unquestionably
a
palpable
negation
of
majority
rule
for
as
no
measure
can
become
a
law
without
the
concurrence
of
the
senate
now
numbering
senators
a
combination
of
the
little
states
whoso
aggregate
population
is
not
a
fifth
of
the
american
people
can
defeat
the
will
of
the
remaining
pennsylvania
and
new
york
with
nearly
of
the
entire
population
of
the
united
states
have
only
four
votes
in
votes
in
the
senate
fortunately
political
alignments
have
rarely
been
between
the
greater
and
the
smaller
states
exclusively
their
equality
in
the
senate
was
a
big
price
to
pay
for
the
union
but
as
the
event
has
shown
not
too
great
the
convention
next
turned
its
attention
to
the
executive
and
the
manner
of
its
selection
and
upon
this
point
there
was
the
widest
contrariety
of
view
but
fortunately
without
the
acute
feeling
that
the
relative
power
of
the
states
had
occasioned
then
the
judiciary
article
was
taken
up
and
there
was
much
earnest
discussion
as
to
whether
the
new
constitution
should
embody
the
french
idea
of
giving
to
the
judiciary
in
conjunction
with
the
executive
a
revisory
power
over
legislation
three
times
the
convention
voted
upon
this
dangerous
proposition
and
on
one
occasion
it
was
only
defeated
by
a
single
vote
fortunately
the
good
sense
of
the
convention
rejected
a
proposition
that
had
caused
in
france
constant
conflicts
between
the
executive
and
the
judiciary
by
substituting
the
right
of
the
president
to
veto
congressional
legislation
with
the
right
of
congress
by
a
vote
of
each
house
to
override
the
veto
and
secondly
by
an
implied
power
in
the
judiciary
to
annul
congressional
or
state
legislation
not
on
the
grounds
of
policy
but
on
the
sole
ground
of
inconsistency
with
the
paramount
law
of
the
constitution
in
this
adjustment
the
influence
of
montesquieu
was
evident
these
and
many
practical
details
had
resulted
in
an
expansion
of
the
fifteen
proposals
of
the
virginia
plan
to
having
thus
determined
the
general
principles
that
should
guide
them
in
their
labours
the
convention
on
july
appointed
a
committee
on
detail
to
embody
these
propositions
in
the
formal
draft
of
a
constitution
and
adjourned
until
august
to
await
its
report
that
report
when
finally
completed
covered
seven
folio
pages
and
was
found
to
consist
of
a
preamble
and
articles
embodying
sections
the
draft
did
not
slavishly
follow
the
virginia
propositions
for
the
committee
embodied
some
valuable
suggestions
which
had
occurred
to
them
in
their
deliberations
nevertheless
it
substantially
put
the
virginia
plan
into
a
workable
plan
which
proved
to
be
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
embryo
when
the
committee
on
detail
had
made
its
report
on
august
the
convention
proceeded
for
over
a
month
to
debate
it
with
the
most
minute
care
every
day
for
five
weeks
for
five
hours
each
day
the
members
studied
and
debated
with
meticulous
care
every
sentence
of
the
proposed
constitution
time
does
not
suffice
even
for
the
barest
statement
of
the
many
interesting
questions
which
were
thus
discussed
but
they
nearly
ran
the
whole
gamut
of
constitutional
government
many
fanciful
ideas
were
suggested
but
with
unvarying
good
sense
they
were
rejected
some
of
the
results
were
under
the
circumstances
curious
for
example
although
it
was
a
convention
of
comparatively
young
men
and
although
the
convention
could
have
taken
into
account
the
many
successful
young
men
in
public
life
in
europe
as
for
example
william
pitt
they
put
a
disqualification
upon
age
by
providing
that
a
representative
must
be
years
of
age
a
senator
thirty
years
of
age
and
a
president
years
of
age
when
it
was
suggested
that
young
men
could
learn
by
admission
to
public
life
the
sententious
reply
was
made
that
while
they
could
they
ought
not
to
have
their
education
at
the
public
expense
the
debates
proceeded
however
in
better
temper
and
almost
the
only
question
that
again
gave
rise
to
passionate
argument
was
that
of
slavery
the
extreme
southern
states
declared
that
they
would
never
accept
the
new
plan
except
the
right
to
import
slaves
be
untouched
this
question
was
finally
compromised
by
agreeing
that
the
importation
of
slaves
should
end
after
the
year
it
however
left
the
slave
population
then
existing
in
a
state
of
bondage
and
for
this
necessary
compromise
the
nation
years
later
was
to
pay
dearly
by
one
of
the
most
destructive
civil
wars
in
the
annals
of
mankind
august
was
now
drawing
to
a
close
the
convention
had
been
in
session
for
more
than
three
months
of
its
work
the
public
knew
nothing
and
this
notwithstanding
the
acute
interest
which
the
american
people
not
merely
facing
the
peril
of
anarchy
but
actually
suffering
from
it
must
have
taken
in
the
convention
its
vital
importance
was
not
while
its
builders
like
all
master
builders
did
build
better
than
they
knew
yet
it
can
not
be
said
that
they
the
importance
of
their
labours
as
one
of
their
number
gouveneur
morris
said
the
whole
human
race
will
be
affected
by
the
proceedings
of
this
convention
after
it
adjourned
one
of
its
greatest
participants
james
wilson
of
pennsylvania
said
after
the
lapse
of
six
thousand
years
since
the
creation
of
the
world
america
now
presents
the
first
instance
of
a
people
assembled
to
say
deliberately
and
calmly
and
to
decide
leisurely
and
peaceably
on
the
form
of
government
by
which
they
will
bind
themselves
and
their
posterity
in
the
absence
of
any
authentic
information
the
rumour
spread
through
the
colonies
that
the
convention
was
about
to
reconstitute
a
monarchy
by
inviting
the
second
son
of
george
iii
the
bishop
of
osnaburg
to
be
king
of
the
united
states
and
these
rumours
became
so
persistent
as
to
evoke
from
the
silent
convention
a
denial
there
is
some
reason
to
believe
that
a
minority
of
the
convention
did
see
in
the
restoration
of
a
constitutional
monarchy
the
only
solution
of
the
problem
on
september
the
committee
had
finally
considered
and
after
modifications
approved
the
draft
of
the
committee
on
detail
and
a
new
committee
was
thereupon
appointed
to
revise
the
style
of
and
arrange
the
articles
that
had
been
agreed
to
by
the
house
this
committee
was
one
of
exceptional
strength
there
were
william
samuel
johnson
a
graduate
of
oxford
and
a
friend
of
his
great
namesake
samuel
johnson
alexander
hamilton
gouveneur
morris
a
brilliant
mind
with
an
unusual
gift
for
lucid
expression
james
madison
a
true
scholar
in
politics
and
rufus
king
an
orator
who
in
the
inflated
language
of
the
day
was
ranked
among
the
luminaries
of
the
present
age
the
convention
then
adjourned
to
await
the
final
revision
of
the
draft
by
the
committee
on
style
on
september
the
committee
reported
while
it
is
not
certain
it
is
believed
that
its
work
was
largely
that
of
gouveneur
morris
september
the
printed
copies
of
the
report
of
the
committee
on
style
were
ready
and
three
more
days
were
spent
by
the
convention
in
carefully
comparing
each
article
and
section
of
this
final
draft
on
september
the
work
of
drafting
the
constitution
was
regarded
as
ended
and
it
was
adopted
and
ordered
to
be
engrossed
for
signing
it
may
be
interesting
at
this
point
to
give
the
result
of
their
labours
as
measured
in
words
and
if
the
framers
of
the
constitution
deserve
the
plaudits
of
posterity
in
no
other
respect
they
do
in
the
remarkable
which
those
results
revealed
the
convention
had
been
in
session
for
continuous
days
probably
they
had
consumed
over
hours
in
debate
if
their
debates
had
been
fully
reported
they
would
probably
have
filled
at
least
fifty
volumes
and
yet
the
net
result
of
their
labours
consisted
of
about
words
sentences
and
about
distinct
provisions
as
the
late
lord
bryce
speaking
in
this
age
of
unbridled
expression
both
oral
and
printed
so
well
has
said
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
including
the
amendments
may
be
read
aloud
in
minutes
it
is
about
half
as
long
as
saint
paul
epistle
to
the
corinthians
and
as
long
as
the
irish
land
act
of
history
knows
few
instruments
which
in
so
few
words
lay
down
equally
momentous
rules
on
a
vast
range
of
matters
of
the
highest
importance
and
complexity
even
including
the
nineteen
amendments
the
constitution
after
one
hundred
and
years
of
development
does
not
exceed
words
what
admirable
possibly
single
opinions
of
the
supreme
court
could
be
cited
which
are
as
long
as
the
whole
document
of
which
they
are
interpreting
a
single
phrase
this
does
not
argue
that
the
constitution
is
an
obscure
document
for
it
would
be
difficult
to
cite
any
political
document
in
the
annals
of
mankind
that
was
so
simple
and
lucid
in
expression
there
is
nothing
johnsonese
about
its
style
every
word
is
a
word
of
plain
speech
the
ordinary
meaning
of
which
even
the
man
in
the
street
knows
no
tautology
is
to
be
found
and
no
attempt
at
ornate
expression
it
is
a
model
of
simplicity
and
as
it
flows
through
the
reaches
of
history
it
will
always
excite
the
admiration
of
those
who
love
clarity
and
not
rhetorical
excesses
one
can
say
of
it
as
horace
said
of
his
favourite
spring
fons
bandusiae
splendidior
vitro
dulce
digne
mero
non
sine
if
i
be
asked
why
if
this
be
true
it
has
required
many
lengthy
opinions
of
the
supreme
court
in
the
volumes
of
its
reports
to
interpret
its
meaning
the
answer
is
that
as
with
the
simple
sayings
of
the
great
galilean
whose
words
have
likewise
been
the
subject
of
unending
commentary
the
question
is
not
one
of
clarity
but
of
adaptation
of
the
meaning
to
the
conditions
of
human
life
moreover
as
with
the
sayings
of
the
master
or
the
unequalled
verse
of
shakespeare
questions
of
construction
are
more
due
to
the
commentators
than
to
the
text
itself
on
september
the
convention
met
for
the
last
time
the
document
was
engrossed
and
laid
before
the
members
for
signature
of
the
members
who
had
attended
only
remained
of
those
a
number
were
unwilling
to
sign
as
individuals
while
the
members
had
not
been
unconscious
of
the
magnitude
of
their
labours
they
were
quite
insensible
of
the
magnitude
of
their
achievement
few
there
were
of
the
convention
who
were
enthusiastic
about
this
result
indeed
as
the
document
was
ready
for
signature
it
became
a
grave
question
whether
the
remnant
which
remained
had
sufficient
faith
in
their
own
work
to
subscribe
their
names
and
if
they
failed
to
do
so
its
adoption
by
the
people
would
have
been
impossible
it
was
then
that
doctor
franklin
rendered
one
of
the
last
and
greatest
services
of
his
life
with
ingratiating
wit
and
with
all
the
impressiveness
that
his
distinguished
career
inspired
franklin
thus
spoke
i
confess
that
there
are
several
parts
of
this
constitution
which
i
do
not
at
present
approve
but
i
am
not
sure
i
shall
never
approve
them
for
having
lived
long
i
have
experienced
many
instances
of
being
obliged
by
better
information
or
fuller
consideration
to
change
opinions
even
on
important
subjects
which
i
once
thought
right
but
found
to
be
otherwise
it
is
therefore
that
the
older
i
grow
the
more
apt
i
am
to
doubt
my
own
judgment
and
to
pay
more
respect
to
the
judgment
of
others
most
men
indeed
as
well
as
most
sects
in
religion
think
themselves
in
possession
of
all
truth
and
that
wherever
others
differ
from
them
it
is
so
far
error
steele
a
protestant
in
a
dedication
tells
the
pope
that
the
only
difference
between
our
churches
in
their
opinions
of
the
certainty
of
their
doctrines
is
the
church
of
rome
is
infallible
and
the
church
of
england
is
never
in
the
wrong
but
though
many
private
persons
think
almost
as
highly
of
their
own
infallibility
as
of
that
of
their
sect
few
express
it
so
naturally
as
a
certain
french
lady
who
in
a
dispute
with
her
sister
said
do
know
how
it
happens
sister
but
i
meet
with
nobody
but
myself
that
always
in
the
right
a
que
moi
qui
a
toujours
in
these
sentiments
sir
i
agree
to
this
constitution
with
all
its
faults
if
they
are
such
because
i
think
a
general
government
necessary
for
us
and
there
is
no
form
of
government
but
what
may
be
a
blessing
to
the
people
if
well
administered
and
i
believe
further
that
this
is
likely
to
be
well
administered
for
a
course
of
years
and
can
only
end
in
despotism
as
other
forms
have
done
before
it
when
the
people
shall
become
so
corrupted
as
to
need
despotic
government
being
incapable
of
any
other
i
doubt
too
whether
any
other
convention
we
can
obtain
may
be
able
to
make
a
better
constitution
for
when
you
assemble
a
number
of
men
to
have
the
advantage
of
their
joint
wisdom
you
inevitably
assemble
with
those
men
all
their
prejudices
their
passions
their
errors
of
opinion
their
local
interests
and
their
selfish
views
from
such
an
assembly
can
a
perfect
production
be
expected
it
therefore
astonishes
me
sir
to
find
this
system
approaching
so
near
to
perfection
as
it
does
thus
i
consent
sir
to
this
constitution
because
i
expect
no
better
and
because
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
not
the
best
the
opinions
i
have
had
of
its
errors
i
sacrifice
to
the
public
good
i
have
never
whispered
a
syllable
of
them
abroad
within
these
walls
they
were
born
and
here
they
shall
die
if
every
one
of
us
in
returning
to
our
constituents
were
to
report
the
objections
he
has
had
to
it
and
endeavour
to
gain
partisans
in
support
of
them
we
might
prevent
its
being
generally
received
and
thereby
lost
all
the
salutary
effects
and
great
advantages
resulting
naturally
in
our
favour
among
foreign
nations
as
well
as
among
ourselves
from
our
real
or
apparent
unanimity
on
the
whole
sir
i
can
not
help
expressing
a
wish
that
every
member
of
the
convention
who
may
still
have
objections
to
it
would
with
me
on
this
occasion
doubt
a
little
of
his
own
infallibility
and
to
make
manifest
our
unanimity
put
his
name
to
this
instrument
truly
this
spirit
of
doctor
franklin
could
be
profitably
invoked
in
this
day
and
generation
when
nations
are
so
intolerant
of
the
ideas
of
other
nations
as
the
members
moved
by
franklin
humorous
and
yet
moving
appeal
came
forward
to
subscribe
their
names
franklin
drew
the
attention
of
some
of
the
members
to
the
fact
that
on
the
back
of
the
president
chair
was
the
half
disk
of
a
sun
and
with
his
love
of
metaphor
he
said
that
painters
had
often
found
it
difficult
to
distinguish
in
their
art
a
rising
from
a
setting
sun
he
then
prophetically
added
i
have
often
and
often
in
the
course
of
the
sessions
and
the
vicissitudes
of
my
hopes
and
fears
in
its
issues
looked
at
that
behind
the
president
without
being
able
to
tell
whether
it
was
rising
or
setting
but
now
at
length
i
have
the
happiness
to
know
that
it
is
a
rising
and
not
a
setting
sun
time
has
verified
the
genial
doctor
prediction
the
career
of
the
new
nation
thus
formed
has
hitherto
been
a
rising
and
not
a
setting
sun
he
had
in
his
sixty
years
of
conspicuously
useful
citizenship
and
perhaps
no
nation
ever
had
a
more
untiring
and
unselfish
servant
done
more
than
any
american
to
develop
the
american
commonwealth
but
like
moses
he
was
destined
to
see
the
promised
land
only
from
afar
for
the
new
government
had
hardly
been
inaugurated
before
franklin
died
as
full
of
years
as
honours
prophetic
as
was
his
vision
he
could
never
have
anticipated
the
reality
of
for
this
nation
thus
deliberately
formed
in
the
light
of
reason
and
without
blood
or
passion
is
by
common
consent
one
of
the
greatest
and
i
trust
i
may
add
one
of
the
noblest
republics
of
all
time
the
political
philosophy
of
the
in
my
last
address
i
left
doctor
franklin
predicting
to
the
discouraged
remnant
of
the
constitutional
convention
that
the
nation
then
formed
would
be
a
rising
sun
in
the
constellation
of
the
nations
the
sun
however
was
destined
to
rise
through
a
bank
of
dark
and
murky
clouds
for
the
constitution
could
not
take
effect
until
it
was
ratified
by
nine
of
the
thirteen
states
and
when
it
was
submitted
to
the
people
who
selected
state
conventions
for
the
purpose
of
ratifying
or
rejecting
the
proposed
plan
of
government
a
bitter
controversy
at
once
ensued
between
two
political
parties
then
in
process
of
formation
one
called
the
constitution
ratified
without
controversy
in
the
remaining
ten
the
struggle
was
long
and
arduous
and
nearly
a
year
passed
before
the
requisite
nine
states
gave
their
assent
two
of
the
states
refused
to
become
parts
of
the
new
nation
even
after
it
began
and
three
years
passed
before
the
thirteen
states
were
under
the
constitution
it
could
not
have
been
ratified
had
there
not
been
an
assurance
that
there
would
be
immediate
amendments
to
provide
a
bill
of
rights
to
safeguard
the
individual
thus
came
into
existence
the
first
ten
amendments
to
the
constitution
with
their
perpetual
guaranty
of
the
fundamental
rights
of
religion
freedom
of
speech
and
of
the
press
the
right
of
assemblage
the
immunity
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
and
similar
guarantees
of
fundamental
individual
rights
distrustful
as
the
american
people
were
of
the
new
constitution
they
yet
had
the
political
sagacity
to
prefer
its
imperfections
whatever
they
imagined
them
to
be
to
the
mad
spirit
of
innovation
and
in
order
that
the
great
instrument
should
not
through
the
excesses
of
party
passion
or
the
temporary
caprices
of
fleeting
generations
speedily
become
a
mere
scrap
of
paper
they
very
wisely
provided
that
no
amendment
should
in
the
future
be
made
unless
it
was
proposed
by
at
least
of
the
senate
and
the
house
of
representatives
and
ratified
by
of
the
states
through
their
legislatures
or
through
special
conventions
this
was
only
one
of
many
striking
negations
of
the
principle
of
majority
rule
as
a
result
of
this
provision
if
we
count
the
first
ten
amendments
as
virtually
part
of
the
original
document
only
nine
amendments
have
been
adopted
in
years
and
of
these
excepting
the
amendments
which
ended
slavery
as
the
result
of
the
civil
war
only
the
last
three
passed
in
recent
years
partly
through
the
relaxing
influence
of
the
world
war
mark
a
serious
departure
from
the
basic
principles
of
the
constitution
this
stability
is
the
more
remarkable
when
we
recall
the
profound
and
revolutionary
change
that
has
taken
place
in
the
social
life
of
man
since
the
constitution
was
adopted
it
was
framed
at
the
very
end
of
the
age
of
humanity
the
industrial
revolution
which
has
more
profoundly
affected
man
in
the
last
century
and
a
half
than
all
the
changes
which
had
theretofore
taken
place
in
the
life
of
man
since
the
was
only
then
beginning
measured
in
terms
of
mechanical
power
men
when
the
constitution
was
formed
were
lilliputians
as
compared
with
the
brobdingnagians
of
our
day
when
man
outflies
the
eagle
outswims
the
fish
and
by
his
conquest
and
utilization
of
the
invisible
forces
of
nature
has
become
the
superman
and
yet
the
constitution
of
is
in
most
of
its
essential
principles
still
the
constitution
of
this
surely
marks
it
as
a
marvel
in
statecraft
and
can
only
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
constitution
was
developed
by
a
people
who
as
children
brave
and
free
of
the
great
had
a
real
genius
for
and
its
essential
element
the
spirit
of
while
it
is
true
that
the
of
the
instrument
has
suffered
almost
as
little
change
as
the
nicene
creed
yet
it
would
be
manifest
error
to
suggest
that
in
its
development
by
practical
application
the
constitution
has
not
undergone
great
changes
the
first
and
greatest
of
all
its
expounders
chief
justice
marshall
said
in
one
of
his
greatest
opinions
that
the
constitution
was
intended
to
endure
for
ages
to
come
and
consequently
to
be
to
the
various
crises
of
human
affairs
to
have
prescribed
the
means
by
which
government
should
in
all
future
times
execute
its
powers
would
have
been
to
change
entirely
the
character
of
the
instrument
and
to
give
it
the
properties
of
a
legal
code
it
would
have
been
an
unwise
attempt
to
provide
by
immutable
rules
for
exigencies
which
if
foreseen
at
all
must
have
been
foreseen
dimly
and
can
best
be
provided
for
as
they
occur
in
this
great
purpose
of
enumerating
rather
than
defining
the
powers
of
government
its
framers
were
supremely
wise
while
it
was
marvellously
sagacious
in
what
it
provided
it
was
wise
to
the
point
of
inspiration
in
what
it
left
unprovided
nothing
is
more
admirable
than
the
of
men
who
venturing
upon
an
untried
experiment
and
after
debating
for
four
months
upon
the
principles
of
government
were
content
to
embody
their
conclusions
in
not
more
than
four
thousand
words
to
this
we
owe
the
elasticity
of
the
instrument
its
vitality
is
due
to
the
fact
that
by
usage
judicial
interpretation
and
when
necessary
formal
amendment
it
can
be
thus
adapted
to
the
changes
of
the
most
progressive
age
in
history
and
that
a
people
have
administered
the
constitution
who
in
the
process
of
such
adaptation
have
generally
shown
the
same
spirit
of
conservative
as
did
the
men
who
framed
it
the
constitution
is
neither
on
the
one
hand
a
gibraltar
rock
which
wholly
resists
the
ceaseless
washing
of
time
or
circumstance
nor
is
it
on
the
other
hand
a
sandy
beach
which
is
slowly
destroyed
by
the
erosion
of
the
waves
it
is
rather
to
be
likened
to
a
floating
dock
which
while
firmly
attached
to
its
moorings
and
not
therefore
the
caprice
of
the
waves
yet
rises
and
falls
with
the
tide
of
time
and
circumstance
while
in
its
practical
adaptation
to
this
complex
age
the
men
who
framed
it
if
they
could
revisit
the
glimpses
of
the
moon
would
as
little
recognize
their
own
handiwork
as
their
own
nation
yet
they
would
still
be
able
to
find
in
successful
operation
the
essential
principles
which
they
embodied
in
the
document
more
than
a
century
ago
its
success
is
also
due
to
the
fact
that
its
framers
were
little
influenced
by
the
spirit
of
doctrinarianism
they
were
not
empiricists
but
very
practical
men
this
is
the
more
remarkable
because
they
worked
in
a
period
of
an
emotional
fermentation
of
human
thought
the
intellect
of
man
had
broken
into
a
violent
eruption
like
that
of
a
seemingly
extinct
volcano
from
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
until
the
end
of
the
french
revolution
the
masses
everywhere
were
influenced
by
the
emotional
and
at
times
hysterical
abstractions
of
the
french
encyclopedists
and
that
these
had
influenced
thought
in
the
american
colonies
is
readily
shown
in
the
preamble
of
the
declaration
of
independence
with
its
unqualified
assertion
of
the
equality
of
men
and
the
absolute
right
of
the
declaration
sought
in
its
noble
idealism
to
make
the
world
safe
for
democracy
but
the
constitution
attempted
the
greater
task
of
making
democracy
safe
for
the
world
by
inducing
a
people
to
impose
upon
themselves
salutary
restraints
upon
majority
rule
fortunately
the
framers
of
the
constitution
had
learned
a
rude
and
terrible
lesson
in
the
anarchy
that
had
followed
the
war
of
independence
they
were
not
so
much
concerned
about
the
rights
of
man
as
about
his
duties
and
their
great
purpose
was
to
substitute
for
the
visionary
idealism
of
a
rampant
individualism
the
authority
of
law
of
the
hysteria
of
that
time
which
was
about
to
culminate
in
the
french
revolution
there
is
no
trace
in
the
constitution
they
were
less
concerned
about
rousseau
social
contract
than
to
restore
law
and
order
hard
realities
and
not
generous
and
impossible
abstractions
interested
them
they
had
suffered
grievously
for
more
than
ten
years
from
misrule
and
had
a
distaste
for
mere
of
which
they
had
had
a
satiety
for
the
constitution
in
which
there
is
not
a
wasted
word
is
as
cold
and
dry
a
document
as
a
problem
in
mathematics
or
a
manual
of
parliamentary
law
its
mandates
have
the
simplicity
and
directness
of
the
ten
commandments
and
like
the
decalogue
it
consists
more
of
what
shall
not
be
done
than
what
shall
be
done
in
this
freedom
from
empiricism
and
sturdy
adherence
to
the
realities
of
life
it
can
be
profitably
commended
to
all
nations
which
may
attempt
a
similar
task
while
the
constitution
apparently
only
deals
with
the
practical
and
essential
details
of
government
yet
underlying
these
simply
but
wonderfully
phrased
delegations
of
power
is
a
broad
and
accurate
political
philosophy
which
goes
far
to
state
the
law
and
the
prophets
of
free
government
these
essential
principles
of
the
constitution
may
be
briefly
summarized
as
follows
first
is
representative
nothing
is
more
striking
in
the
debates
of
the
convention
than
the
distrust
of
its
members
with
few
exceptions
of
what
they
called
democracy
by
this
term
they
meant
the
power
of
the
people
to
legislate
directly
and
without
the
intervention
of
chosen
representatives
they
believed
that
the
utmost
concession
that
could
be
safely
made
to
democracy
was
the
power
to
select
suitable
men
to
legislate
for
the
common
good
and
nothing
is
more
striking
in
the
constitution
than
the
care
with
which
they
sought
to
remove
the
powers
of
legislation
from
the
action
of
the
people
nowhere
in
the
instrument
is
there
a
suggestion
of
the
initiative
or
referendum
even
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
could
not
be
directly
proposed
by
the
people
in
the
exercise
of
their
residual
power
or
adopted
by
them
as
previously
said
it
could
only
be
proposed
by
of
the
house
and
the
senate
and
then
could
only
become
effective
if
ratified
by
of
the
states
acting
not
by
a
popular
vote
but
through
their
chosen
representatives
either
in
their
legislatures
or
special
conventions
thus
they
denied
the
power
of
a
majority
to
alter
even
the
form
of
government
moreover
they
gave
to
the
president
the
power
to
nullify
laws
passed
by
a
majority
of
the
house
and
senate
by
his
simple
veto
and
yet
fearful
of
an
unqualified
power
of
the
president
in
this
respect
they
provided
that
the
veto
itself
should
be
vetoed
if
of
the
senate
and
house
concurred
in
such
action
moreover
the
great
limitations
of
the
constitution
which
forbid
the
majority
or
even
the
whole
body
of
the
house
and
senate
to
pass
laws
either
for
want
of
authority
or
because
they
impair
fundamental
rights
of
individuals
are
as
emphatic
a
negation
of
an
absolute
democracy
as
can
be
found
in
any
form
of
government
measured
by
conventions
of
democracy
the
constitution
is
an
undemocratic
document
the
framers
believed
in
representative
government
to
which
they
gave
the
name
republicanism
as
the
antithesis
to
democracy
the
members
of
the
senate
were
to
be
selected
by
state
legislatures
and
the
president
himself
was
as
originally
planned
to
be
selected
by
an
electoral
college
similar
to
the
college
of
cardinals
the
debates
are
full
of
utterances
which
explain
this
attitude
of
mind
gerry
said
the
evils
we
experience
flow
from
the
excesses
of
democracy
the
people
are
the
dupes
of
pretended
patriots
randolph
the
author
of
the
virginia
plan
observed
that
the
general
object
of
the
constitution
was
to
provide
a
cure
for
the
evils
under
which
the
united
states
laboured
that
in
tracing
these
evils
to
their
origin
every
man
had
found
it
in
the
tribulation
and
follies
of
democracy
that
some
check
therefore
was
to
be
sought
for
against
this
tendency
of
our
government
alexander
hamilton
remarked
on
june
that
the
members
most
tenacious
of
republicanism
were
as
loud
as
any
in
declaiming
against
the
evils
of
democracy
he
added
give
all
the
power
to
the
many
and
they
will
oppress
the
few
give
all
the
power
to
the
few
and
they
will
oppress
the
many
both
ought
therefore
to
have
the
power
that
each
may
defend
itself
against
the
other
perhaps
the
attitude
of
the
members
is
thus
best
expressed
by
james
madison
in
the
of
the
federalist
papers
a
pure
democracy
by
which
i
mean
a
state
consisting
of
a
small
number
of
citizens
who
assemble
and
administer
the
government
in
person
can
admit
of
no
cure
for
the
mischiefs
of
faction
such
democracies
have
ever
been
spectacles
of
turbulence
and
contention
and
have
often
been
found
incompatible
with
the
personal
security
and
rights
of
property
and
have
generally
been
as
short
in
their
lives
as
they
have
been
violent
in
their
deaths
undoubtedly
the
framers
of
the
constitution
in
thus
limiting
popular
rule
did
not
take
sufficient
account
of
the
genius
of
an
people
a
few
of
their
number
recognized
this
franklin
a
man
believed
in
democracy
and
doubted
the
efficacy
of
the
constitution
unless
it
was
like
a
pyramid
upon
the
will
of
the
people
colonel
mason
of
virginia
who
was
also
of
the
jeffersonian
school
of
political
philosophy
said
notwithstanding
the
oppression
and
injustice
experienced
among
us
from
democracy
the
genius
of
the
people
is
in
favour
of
it
and
the
genius
of
the
people
must
be
consulted
in
this
they
were
true
prophets
for
the
american
people
have
refused
to
limit
democracy
as
narrowly
and
rigidly
as
the
framers
of
the
constitution
clearly
intended
the
most
notable
illustration
of
this
is
the
selection
of
the
president
it
was
never
contemplated
that
the
people
should
directly
select
the
president
but
that
a
chosen
body
of
electors
should
with
careful
deliberation
make
this
momentous
choice
while
in
form
the
system
persists
to
this
day
from
the
very
beginning
the
electors
simply
vote
as
the
people
who
select
them
desire
it
should
here
be
noted
that
thomas
jefferson
the
great
democrat
and
draftsman
of
the
declaration
of
independence
was
not
a
member
of
the
convention
during
its
sessions
he
was
in
france
he
was
instrumental
in
securing
the
first
ten
amendments
and
the
subsequent
adaptation
of
the
constitution
to
meet
the
democratic
instincts
of
the
american
people
is
largely
due
to
his
great
leadership
moreover
the
spirit
of
representative
government
has
greatly
changed
since
the
constitution
was
adopted
the
ideal
of
the
earlier
time
was
that
so
nobly
expressed
by
edmund
burke
in
his
address
to
the
electors
of
bristol
for
the
framers
believed
that
a
representative
held
a
judicial
position
of
the
most
sacred
character
and
that
he
should
vote
as
his
judgment
and
conscience
dictated
without
respect
to
the
wishes
of
his
constituents
and
notably
in
the
last
half
century
the
contrary
belief
due
largely
to
jefferson
political
ideals
has
so
influenced
american
politics
that
the
representatives
of
the
people
either
in
the
legislature
or
the
executive
departments
of
the
government
are
considered
by
the
masses
as
only
the
mouthpieces
of
the
people
who
select
them
and
to
ignore
their
wishes
is
regarded
as
virtually
a
betrayal
of
a
trust
and
the
negation
of
democracy
for
this
change
in
attitude
there
has
been
much
justification
for
in
my
country
as
elsewhere
the
people
do
not
always
select
their
best
men
as
representatives
and
with
the
imperfections
of
human
nature
there
has
been
so
much
of
ignorance
and
at
times
venality
that
the
instinct
of
the
people
is
to
take
the
conduct
of
affairs
into
their
own
hands
on
the
other
hand
this
change
of
attitude
has
led
in
many
instances
to
government
by
organized
minorities
for
with
the
division
of
the
masses
into
political
parties
it
is
easy
for
an
organized
minority
to
hold
the
balance
of
power
and
thus
impress
its
will
upon
majorities
time
may
yet
vindicate
the
theory
of
the
framers
that
the
limit
of
democracy
is
the
selection
of
true
and
tried
representatives
second
and
most
novel
principle
of
the
constitution
is
its
dual
form
of
this
did
constitute
a
unique
contribution
to
the
science
of
politics
this
was
early
recognized
by
de
tocqueville
one
of
the
most
acute
students
of
the
constitution
who
said
that
it
was
based
upon
a
wholly
novel
theory
which
may
be
considered
a
great
discovery
in
modern
political
science
previous
to
the
constitution
it
had
not
been
thought
possible
to
divide
sovereignty
or
at
least
to
have
two
different
sovereignties
moving
as
planets
in
the
same
orbit
therefore
all
previous
federated
governments
had
been
based
upon
the
plan
that
a
league
could
only
effect
its
will
through
the
constituent
states
and
that
the
citizens
in
these
states
owed
no
direct
allegiance
to
the
league
but
only
to
the
states
of
which
they
were
members
the
constitution
however
developed
the
idea
of
a
dual
citizenship
while
the
people
remained
citizens
of
their
respective
states
in
the
sphere
of
government
which
was
reserved
to
the
states
yet
they
directly
became
citizens
of
the
central
government
and
as
such
ceased
to
be
citizens
of
the
several
states
in
the
sphere
of
government
delegated
to
the
central
power
and
this
allegiance
was
enforced
by
the
direct
action
of
the
central
government
on
the
citizens
as
individuals
thus
has
been
developed
one
of
the
most
intricately
complex
governmental
systems
in
the
world
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
this
division
of
jurisdiction
was
quite
feasible
for
geographically
the
various
states
were
widely
separated
and
the
lack
of
economic
contact
made
it
easy
for
each
government
to
function
without
serious
conflict
the
framers
however
did
not
sufficiently
reckon
with
the
mechanical
changes
in
society
that
were
then
beginning
they
did
not
anticipate
and
could
not
have
anticipated
the
centripetal
influences
of
steam
and
electricity
which
have
woven
the
american
people
into
an
indissoluble
unit
for
commercial
and
many
other
purposes
as
a
result
many
laws
of
the
federal
government
in
their
incidences
in
this
complex
age
directly
impinge
upon
rights
of
the
state
governments
and
and
the
practical
application
of
the
constitution
has
required
a
very
subtle
adaptation
of
a
form
of
government
which
was
enacted
in
a
primitive
age
to
a
form
of
government
of
a
complex
age
take
for
example
the
power
over
commerce
according
to
the
constitution
the
federal
government
had
plenary
power
over
foreign
commerce
and
commerce
the
states
but
the
power
over
commerce
a
state
was
reserved
to
state
governments
this
presupposed
the
power
of
government
to
divide
commerce
into
two
compartments
or
at
least
to
regard
the
two
spheres
of
power
as
parallel
lines
that
would
never
meet
whereas
with
the
coming
of
the
railroad
steamship
and
the
telegraph
commerce
has
become
so
unified
that
the
parallel
lines
have
become
lines
of
interlacing
zigzags
to
adapt
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution
to
these
changed
conditions
has
required
in
the
highest
degree
the
constructive
genius
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
in
a
series
of
very
remarkable
decisions
which
are
contained
in
volumes
of
the
official
reports
that
great
tribunal
has
tried
to
draw
a
line
between
and
domestic
commerce
as
nearly
to
the
original
plans
of
the
framers
as
it
was
possible
but
obviously
there
has
been
so
much
adaptation
to
make
this
possible
that
if
washington
franklin
madison
and
hamilton
could
revisit
the
nation
they
created
they
would
not
recognize
their
own
handiwork
for
the
same
reason
the
dual
system
of
government
has
been
profoundly
modified
by
the
great
elemental
forces
of
our
mechanical
age
so
that
the
scales
which
try
to
hold
in
nice
equipoise
the
federal
government
on
the
one
hand
and
the
states
on
the
other
have
been
greatly
disturbed
originally
the
states
were
the
powerful
political
entities
and
the
central
government
a
mere
agent
for
certain
specific
purposes
but
in
the
development
of
the
constitution
the
nation
has
naturally
become
of
overshadowing
importance
while
the
states
have
relatively
steadily
diminished
in
power
and
prestige
these
inevitable
tendencies
in
american
politics
are
called
centralization
and
while
for
nearly
a
century
a
great
political
party
bitterly
contested
its
steady
progress
due
to
the
centripetal
influences
above
indicated
yet
the
contest
was
long
since
abandoned
as
a
hopeless
one
and
the
struggle
is
rather
to
keep
so
far
as
possible
the
inevitable
tendency
measurably
in
check
nevertheless
it
would
be
erroneous
to
suggest
that
the
dual
system
of
government
is
a
failure
it
still
endures
in
providing
a
large
measure
of
authority
to
the
states
in
their
purely
domestic
concerns
and
in
a
country
that
extends
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
and
from
the
lakes
to
the
gulf
whose
northern
border
is
not
very
far
from
the
arctic
circle
and
whose
southern
border
is
not
many
degrees
from
the
equator
there
are
such
differences
in
the
habits
conventions
and
ideals
of
the
people
that
without
this
dual
form
of
government
the
constitution
would
long
since
have
broken
down
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
success
with
which
the
framers
of
the
constitution
reconciled
national
supremacy
and
efficiency
with
local
is
one
of
the
great
achievements
in
the
history
of
mankind
third
principle
was
the
guaranty
of
individual
liberty
through
constitutional
this
marked
another
great
contribution
of
america
to
the
science
of
government
in
all
previous
government
building
the
state
was
regarded
as
a
sovereign
which
could
grant
to
individuals
or
classes
out
of
its
plenary
power
certain
privileges
or
exemptions
which
were
called
liberties
thus
the
liberties
which
the
barons
wrung
from
king
john
at
runnymede
were
virtually
exemptions
from
the
power
of
government
our
fathers
did
not
believe
in
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
in
the
sense
of
absolute
power
nor
did
they
believe
in
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
in
that
sense
the
word
sovereignty
will
not
be
found
in
the
constitution
or
the
declaration
of
independence
they
believed
that
each
individual
as
a
responsible
moral
being
had
certain
inalienable
rights
which
neither
the
state
nor
the
people
could
rightfully
take
from
him
this
conception
of
individualism
enforced
in
courts
of
law
against
executives
and
legislatures
was
wholly
new
and
is
the
distinguishing
characteristic
of
american
constitutionalism
as
to
such
reserved
rights
guaranteed
by
constitutional
limitations
and
largely
by
the
first
ten
amendments
to
the
constitution
a
man
by
virtue
of
his
inherent
and
dignity
as
a
human
soul
has
rights
such
as
freedom
of
the
press
liberty
of
speech
property
rights
and
religious
freedom
which
even
one
hundred
millions
of
people
can
not
rightfully
take
from
him
without
amending
the
constitution
the
framers
did
not
believe
that
the
oil
of
anointing
that
was
supposed
to
sanctify
the
monarch
and
give
him
infallibility
had
fallen
upon
the
multitudinous
tongue
of
the
people
to
give
it
either
infallibility
or
omnipotence
they
believed
in
individualism
they
were
animated
by
a
sleepless
jealousy
of
governmental
power
they
believed
that
the
greater
such
power
the
greater
the
danger
of
its
abuse
they
felt
that
the
individual
could
generally
best
work
out
his
own
salvation
and
that
his
constant
prayer
to
government
was
that
of
diogenes
to
alexander
keep
out
of
my
sunlight
the
worth
and
dignity
of
the
human
soul
the
free
competition
of
man
and
man
the
nobility
of
labour
the
right
to
work
free
from
the
tyranny
of
state
or
class
this
was
their
gospel
socialism
was
to
them
abhorrent
this
theory
of
government
gave
a
new
dignity
to
manhood
it
said
to
the
state
there
is
a
limit
to
your
power
thus
far
and
no
further
and
here
shall
thy
proud
waves
be
stayed
allied
to
this
doctrine
of
limited
governmental
powers
even
by
a
majority
is
the
fourth
principle
of
an
independent
it
is
the
balance
wheel
of
the
constitution
and
to
function
it
must
be
beyond
the
possibility
of
attack
and
destruction
my
country
was
founded
upon
the
rock
of
property
rights
and
the
sanctity
of
contracts
both
the
nation
and
the
several
states
are
forbidden
to
impair
the
obligation
of
contracts
or
take
away
life
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law
the
guarantee
is
as
old
as
magna
charta
for
due
process
of
law
is
but
a
paraphrase
of
the
law
of
the
land
without
which
no
freeman
could
be
deprived
of
his
liberties
or
possessions
due
process
of
law
means
that
there
are
certain
fundamental
principles
of
liberty
not
defined
or
even
enumerated
in
the
constitution
but
having
their
sanction
in
the
free
and
enlightened
conscience
of
just
men
and
that
no
man
can
be
deprived
of
life
liberty
or
property
except
in
conformity
with
these
fundamental
decencies
of
liberty
to
protect
these
even
against
the
will
of
a
majority
however
large
the
judiciary
was
given
unprecedented
powers
it
threw
about
the
individual
the
solemn
circle
of
the
law
it
made
the
judiciary
the
final
conscience
of
the
nation
your
nation
cherishes
the
same
primal
verities
of
liberty
but
with
you
the
people
in
parliament
is
the
final
judge
we
however
are
not
content
that
a
majority
of
the
legislature
shall
override
inviolable
individual
rights
about
which
the
judiciary
is
empowered
to
throw
the
solemn
circle
of
the
law
this
august
power
has
won
the
admiration
of
the
world
and
by
many
is
regarded
as
a
novel
contribution
to
the
science
of
government
the
idea
however
was
not
wholly
novel
as
previously
shown
four
chief
justices
of
england
had
declared
that
an
act
of
parliament
if
against
common
right
and
reason
could
be
treated
as
null
and
void
while
in
france
the
power
of
the
judiciary
to
refuse
efficacy
to
a
law
unless
sanctioned
by
the
judiciary
had
been
the
cause
of
a
long
struggle
for
at
least
three
centuries
between
the
french
monarch
and
the
courts
of
france
however
in
england
the
doctrine
of
the
common
law
yielded
to
the
later
doctrine
of
the
omnipotence
of
parliament
while
in
france
the
revisory
power
of
the
judiciary
was
terminated
by
the
french
revolution
the
united
states
however
embodied
it
in
its
form
of
government
and
thus
made
the
judiciary
and
especially
the
supreme
court
the
balance
wheel
of
the
constitution
without
such
power
the
constitution
could
never
have
lasted
for
neither
executive
officers
nor
legislatures
are
good
judges
of
the
extent
of
their
own
powers
nothing
more
strikingly
shows
the
spirit
of
unity
which
the
constitution
brought
into
being
than
the
unbroken
success
with
which
the
supreme
court
has
discharged
this
difficult
and
most
delicate
duty
the
president
is
the
of
the
army
and
the
navy
and
can
call
them
to
his
aid
the
legislature
has
almost
unlimited
power
through
its
control
of
the
public
purse
the
states
have
their
power
reinforced
by
armed
forces
and
some
of
them
are
as
great
in
population
and
resources
as
many
of
the
nations
of
europe
the
supreme
court
however
has
only
one
officer
to
execute
its
decrees
called
the
united
states
marshal
and
yet
without
sword
or
purse
and
with
only
a
high
sheriff
to
enforce
its
mandates
when
the
supreme
court
says
to
a
president
or
to
a
congress
or
to
the
authorities
of
a
great
and
in
some
respects
sovereign
state
that
they
must
do
this
or
must
refrain
from
doing
that
the
mandate
is
at
once
obeyed
here
indeed
is
the
american
ideal
of
a
government
of
laws
and
not
of
men
most
strikingly
realized
and
if
the
american
constitution
as
formulated
and
developed
had
done
nothing
else
than
to
establish
in
this
manner
the
supremacy
of
law
even
as
against
the
overwhelming
sentiment
of
the
people
it
would
have
justified
the
encomium
of
gladstone
it
must
be
added
however
that
in
one
respect
this
function
of
the
judiciary
has
had
an
unfortunate
effect
in
lessening
rather
than
developing
in
the
people
the
sense
of
constitutional
morality
in
your
country
the
power
of
parliament
is
omnipotent
and
yet
in
its
legislation
it
voluntarily
observes
these
great
fundamental
decencies
of
liberty
which
in
the
american
constitution
are
protected
by
formal
guarantees
this
can
only
be
true
because
either
your
representatives
in
parliament
have
a
deep
sense
of
constitutional
morality
or
that
the
constituencies
which
select
them
have
so
much
sense
of
constitutional
justice
that
their
representatives
dare
not
disregard
these
fundamental
decencies
of
liberty
in
the
united
states
however
the
confidence
that
the
supreme
court
will
itself
protect
these
guaranties
of
liberty
has
led
to
a
diminution
of
the
sense
of
constitutional
morality
both
in
the
people
and
their
representatives
it
abates
the
vigilance
which
is
said
to
be
ever
the
price
of
liberty
laws
are
passed
which
transgress
the
limitations
of
the
constitution
without
adequate
discussion
as
to
their
unconstitutional
character
for
the
reason
that
the
determination
of
this
fact
is
erroneously
supposed
to
be
the
exclusive
function
of
the
judiciary
the
judiciary
contrary
to
the
common
supposition
has
no
plenary
power
to
nullify
unconstitutional
laws
it
can
only
do
so
when
there
is
an
irreconcilable
and
indubitable
repugnancy
between
a
law
and
the
constitution
but
obviously
laws
can
be
passed
from
motives
that
are
and
there
is
a
wide
sphere
of
political
discretion
in
which
many
acts
can
be
done
which
while
politically
are
not
juridically
unconstitutional
for
this
reason
the
undue
dependence
upon
the
judiciary
to
nullify
every
law
which
either
in
form
necessary
operation
or
motive
transgresses
the
constitution
has
so
far
lessened
the
vigilance
of
the
people
to
protect
their
own
constitution
as
to
lead
to
its
serious
impairment
fifth
fundamental
principle
was
a
system
of
governmental
checks
and
the
founders
of
the
republic
were
not
enamoured
of
power
as
they
viewed
human
history
the
worst
evils
of
government
were
due
to
excessive
concentration
of
power
which
like
othello
jealousy
makes
the
meat
it
feeds
on
this
system
of
checks
and
balances
again
illustrates
that
the
constitution
is
the
great
negation
of
unrestrained
democracy
the
framers
believed
that
a
people
was
best
governed
that
was
least
governed
therefore
their
purpose
was
not
so
much
to
promote
efficiency
in
legislation
as
to
put
a
brake
upon
precipitate
action
time
does
not
suffice
to
state
the
intricate
system
of
checks
and
balances
whereby
the
legislature
acts
as
a
check
upon
the
executive
and
the
executive
upon
the
legislature
and
the
supreme
court
upon
both
when
the
republic
was
small
and
its
public
affairs
were
few
this
system
of
checks
and
balances
worked
admirably
but
when
the
nation
is
one
of
the
greatest
in
the
world
and
its
public
affairs
are
of
the
most
important
and
complicated
character
and
often
require
speedy
action
it
may
be
questioned
whether
the
system
is
not
now
an
undue
brake
upon
governmental
efficiency
and
does
require
some
modification
to
ensure
efficiency
indeed
it
is
a
serious
question
with
many
thoughtful
americans
whether
the
growth
of
the
united
states
has
not
put
an
excessive
strain
upon
its
governmental
machinery
this
system
was
in
part
due
to
the
confident
belief
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
in
the
montesquieu
doctrine
of
the
division
of
government
into
three
independent
departments
legislative
executive
and
judicial
but
experience
has
shown
how
difficult
it
is
to
apply
this
doctrine
in
its
literal
rigidity
one
result
of
the
doctrine
was
the
mistaken
attempt
to
keep
the
legislative
and
the
executive
as
far
apart
as
possible
the
cabinet
system
of
parliamentary
government
was
not
adopted
while
the
president
can
appear
before
congress
and
express
his
views
his
cabinet
is
without
such
right
in
practice
the
gulf
is
bridged
by
constant
contact
between
the
cabinet
and
the
committees
of
congress
but
this
does
not
wholly
secure
speedy
and
efficient
between
the
two
departments
as
i
speak
a
movement
is
in
progress
with
the
sanction
of
president
harding
to
permit
members
of
his
cabinet
to
appear
in
congress
and
thus
defend
directly
and
in
person
the
policies
of
the
executive
this
separation
of
the
two
departments
which
causes
so
much
friction
has
been
emphasized
by
one
feature
of
the
constitution
which
again
marks
its
distrust
of
democracy
namely
the
fixed
tenure
of
office
the
constitution
did
not
intend
that
public
officials
should
rise
or
fall
with
the
fleeting
caprices
of
a
constituency
it
preferred
to
give
the
president
and
the
members
of
congress
a
fixed
term
of
office
and
however
unpopular
they
might
become
temporarily
they
should
have
the
right
and
the
opportunity
to
proceed
even
with
unpopular
policies
and
thus
challenge
the
final
verdict
of
the
people
if
a
parliamentary
form
of
government
immediately
responsive
to
current
opinion
as
registered
in
elections
is
the
great
desideratum
then
the
fixed
tenure
of
offices
is
the
vulnerable
of
our
form
of
government
in
other
countries
the
executive
can
not
survive
a
vote
of
want
of
confidence
by
the
legislature
in
america
the
president
who
is
merely
the
executive
of
the
legislative
will
continues
for
his
prescribed
term
though
he
may
have
wholly
lost
the
confidence
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
in
congress
while
this
makes
for
stability
in
administration
and
keeps
the
ship
of
state
on
an
even
keel
yet
it
also
leads
to
the
fatalism
of
our
democracy
and
often
the
native
hue
of
its
resolution
is
thus
sicklied
with
the
pale
cast
of
thought
take
a
striking
instance
i
am
confident
that
after
the
sinking
of
the
the
united
states
would
have
entered
the
world
war
if
president
wilson
tenure
of
power
had
then
depended
upon
a
vote
of
confidence
sixth
fundamental
principle
is
the
joint
power
of
the
senate
and
the
executive
over
the
foreign
relations
of
the
i
need
not
dwell
at
length
upon
this
unique
feature
of
our
constitutional
system
for
since
the
versailles
treaty
the
world
has
become
well
acquainted
with
our
peculiar
system
under
which
treaties
are
made
and
war
is
declared
or
terminated
nothing
excepting
the
principle
of
local
rule
was
of
deeper
concern
to
the
framers
of
the
constitution
when
it
was
framed
it
was
the
accepted
principle
of
all
other
nations
that
the
control
of
the
foreign
relations
of
the
government
was
the
exclusive
prerogative
of
the
executive
in
your
country
the
only
limitation
upon
that
power
was
the
control
of
parliament
over
the
purse
of
the
nation
and
some
of
the
great
struggles
in
your
history
related
to
the
attempt
of
the
crown
to
exact
money
to
carry
on
the
wars
without
a
parliament
grant
the
framers
were
unwilling
to
lodge
any
such
power
in
the
executive
however
great
his
powers
in
other
respects
this
was
primarily
due
to
the
conception
of
the
states
that
then
prevailed
while
they
had
created
a
central
government
for
certain
specified
purposes
they
yet
regarded
themselves
as
sovereign
nations
and
their
representatives
in
the
senate
were
in
a
sense
their
ambassadors
they
were
as
little
inclined
to
permit
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
make
treaties
or
declare
war
at
will
in
their
behalf
as
the
european
nations
would
be
to
vest
a
similar
authority
in
the
league
of
nations
it
was
therefore
first
proposed
that
the
power
to
make
treaties
and
appoint
diplomatic
representatives
should
be
vested
exclusively
in
the
senate
but
as
that
body
was
not
always
in
session
this
plan
was
so
far
modified
as
to
give
the
president
who
is
always
acting
the
power
to
treaties
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
as
to
making
war
the
framers
were
not
willing
to
entrust
the
power
even
to
the
president
and
the
senators
and
it
was
therefore
expressly
provided
that
only
congress
could
take
this
momentous
step
here
again
the
theory
of
the
constitution
was
necessarily
somewhat
modified
in
practical
administration
for
under
the
power
of
nominating
diplomatic
representatives
negotiating
treaties
and
in
general
of
executing
the
laws
of
the
nation
the
principle
was
soon
evolved
that
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
was
primarily
the
function
of
the
president
with
the
limitation
that
the
senate
must
concur
in
diplomatic
appointments
and
in
the
validity
of
treaties
and
that
only
both
houses
of
congress
could
jointly
declare
war
this
cumbrous
system
necessarily
required
that
the
president
in
conducting
the
foreign
relations
of
the
government
should
keep
in
touch
with
the
senate
and
such
was
the
accepted
procedure
throughout
the
history
of
the
nation
until
president
wilson
saw
fit
to
ignore
the
senate
even
when
the
senate
had
indicated
its
dissent
in
advance
to
some
of
his
policies
at
the
versailles
conference
i
suppose
that
since
that
conference
no
part
of
our
constitutional
system
has
caused
more
adverse
comment
in
europe
than
this
system
it
often
handicaps
the
united
states
from
taking
a
speedy
and
effectual
part
in
international
negotiations
although
if
the
president
and
the
senate
be
in
harmony
and
collaborate
in
this
joint
responsibility
there
is
no
necessary
reason
why
this
should
be
so
i
share
the
view
of
many
americans
that
this
provision
of
the
constitution
was
wise
and
salutary
especially
at
this
time
when
the
united
states
has
taken
such
an
important
position
in
the
councils
of
civilization
the
president
is
a
very
powerful
executive
and
his
tenure
while
short
is
fixed
generally
he
is
elected
by
little
more
than
a
majority
of
the
people
and
sometimes
through
the
curious
workings
of
the
electoral
college
system
he
has
been
only
the
choice
of
a
minority
of
the
electorate
for
these
reasons
the
framers
of
the
constitution
were
unwilling
to
vest
in
the
president
exclusively
the
immeasurable
power
of
pledging
the
faith
and
resources
of
the
nation
and
of
declaring
war
the
heterogeneous
character
of
our
population
especially
emphasizes
the
wisdom
of
this
course
for
it
would
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
an
american
president
to
make
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
with
any
nation
or
declare
war
against
another
nation
without
running
counter
to
the
racial
interests
and
passions
of
a
substantial
part
of
the
american
nation
for
better
or
worse
the
united
states
has
limited
but
not
destroyed
as
the
world
war
showed
its
freedom
to
antagonize
powerful
nations
from
whose
people
it
has
drawn
large
numbers
of
its
own
citizenship
the
domestic
harmony
of
the
nation
requires
that
before
the
united
states
assumes
treaty
obligations
or
makes
war
such
policy
shall
represent
the
largely
preponderating
sentiment
of
its
people
and
nothing
could
more
effectually
secure
this
end
than
to
require
the
president
before
making
a
treaty
to
secure
the
assent
of
of
the
senate
and
a
majority
of
both
houses
of
congress
before
making
war
while
this
may
lead
as
it
has
in
recent
years
to
temporary
and
regrettable
embarrassments
yet
in
the
long
run
it
is
not
only
better
for
the
united
states
but
it
is
even
to
the
best
interests
of
other
nations
for
in
this
way
they
are
safeguarded
against
the
possible
action
of
an
executive
with
whom
racial
instincts
might
still
be
very
influential
in
your
country
where
the
government
of
the
day
is
subject
to
immediate
dismissal
for
want
of
confidence
such
power
over
foreign
relations
can
be
safely
entrusted
to
a
few
men
but
in
the
united
states
with
its
fixed
tenures
of
office
a
president
could
pledge
the
faith
and
involve
his
nation
in
war
against
the
interests
and
will
of
the
people
suppose
the
president
had
unlimited
power
over
our
foreign
relations
and
that
within
the
next
ten
years
an
american
whose
parents
were
born
in
any
european
nation
was
elected
on
purely
domestic
issues
he
could
with
his
assured
four
years
of
power
bring
about
a
new
alignment
of
nations
and
shake
the
political
equilibrium
of
the
world
the
constitution
wisely
refused
to
grant
such
a
power
hence
the
provision
for
the
concurrence
of
the
legislative
representatives
of
the
nation
at
all
events
it
constitutes
a
system
which
as
the
last
presidential
election
showed
the
american
people
will
not
willingly
forgo
it
is
true
that
this
system
makes
it
difficult
for
the
united
states
to
participate
effectively
in
the
main
purpose
of
the
league
of
nations
to
enforce
peace
by
joint
action
at
geneva
but
to
ask
the
united
states
to
surrender
a
vital
part
of
its
constitutional
system
upon
which
its
domestic
peace
so
largely
depends
in
order
to
promote
the
league
seems
to
me
as
unreasonable
as
it
would
be
to
ask
your
country
to
abolish
the
crown
to
which
it
is
sincerely
attached
as
a
vital
part
of
its
system
as
a
contribution
towards
international
you
would
not
surrender
such
an
integral
part
of
your
system
and
therefore
it
is
not
reasonable
to
expect
a
similar
sacrifice
on
our
part
even
though
the
meritorious
purposes
of
the
league
be
freely
recognized
i
have
thus
summarized
briefly
and
most
inadequately
some
of
the
essential
principles
of
the
constitution
i
have
only
been
able
to
suggest
very
impressionistically
what
they
are
and
the
lessons
to
be
drawn
from
them
if
i
were
able
to
deliver
a
dozen
addresses
on
the
subject
in
this
historic
hall
and
with
this
indulgent
audience
i
would
not
scratch
even
the
surface
to
understand
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
you
must
not
only
read
the
text
but
the
thousands
of
opinions
rendered
in
the
last
years
by
the
supreme
court
in
its
great
task
of
interpreting
this
wonderful
document
few
documents
have
been
the
subject
of
more
extended
commentaries
the
four
thousand
words
have
been
meticulously
examined
through
intellectual
microscopes
in
judicial
opinions
textbooks
and
other
commentaries
which
are
as
thick
as
autumnal
leaves
that
strow
the
brooks
in
vallombrosa
one
can
say
of
this
document
as
furness
in
his
variorum
edition
of
says
of
the
words
of
that
character
no
words
by
him
let
fall
no
syllable
by
him
uttered
but
has
been
caught
up
and
pondered
as
no
words
except
those
of
holy
writ
but
what
of
its
future
and
how
long
will
the
constitution
wholly
resist
the
washing
of
time
and
circumstance
lord
macaulay
once
ventured
the
prediction
that
the
constitution
would
prove
unworkable
as
soon
as
there
were
no
longer
large
areas
of
undeveloped
land
and
when
the
united
states
became
a
nation
of
great
cities
that
period
of
development
has
arrived
in
only
per
cent
of
the
american
population
lived
in
the
cities
and
the
remainder
were
still
on
the
farms
over
per
cent
are
crowded
in
one
hundred
great
cities
lord
macaulay
added
i
believe
america
fate
is
only
deferred
by
physical
causes
institutions
purely
democratic
will
sooner
or
later
destroy
liberty
or
civilization
or
both
the
american
constitution
is
all
sail
and
no
anchor
in
this
last
commentary
lord
macaulay
was
clearly
mistaken
as
i
have
shown
the
constitution
is
not
purely
democratic
it
is
amazing
that
so
great
a
mind
should
have
so
little
understood
that
more
than
any
other
constitution
that
of
america
imposes
powerful
restraints
on
democracy
the
experience
of
a
century
and
a
quarter
has
shown
that
while
the
anchor
may
at
times
drag
yet
it
measurably
holds
the
ship
of
state
to
its
ancient
moorings
the
american
constitution
still
remains
in
its
essential
principles
and
still
enjoys
not
only
the
confidence
but
the
affection
of
the
great
and
varied
people
whom
it
rules
to
the
latter
this
remarkable
achievement
must
be
attributed
rather
than
to
any
inherent
strength
in
parchment
or
red
seals
for
in
a
democracy
the
living
soul
of
any
constitution
must
be
such
belief
of
the
people
in
its
wisdom
and
justice
if
it
should
perish
it
would
yet
have
enjoyed
a
life
and
growth
of
which
any
nation
or
age
might
be
justly
proud
moreover
it
could
claim
with
truth
if
it
finally
perished
that
it
had
been
subjected
to
conditions
for
which
it
was
never
intended
and
that
some
of
its
essential
principles
had
been
ignored
the
constitution
is
something
more
than
a
written
formula
of
government
it
is
a
great
spirit
it
is
a
high
and
noble
assertion
and
indeed
vindication
of
the
morality
of
government
it
renders
unto
caesar
the
political
state
the
things
that
are
caesar
but
in
safeguarding
the
fundamental
moral
rights
of
the
people
it
renders
unto
god
the
things
that
are
god
in
concluding
i
can
not
refrain
from
again
reminding
you
that
this
consummate
work
of
statecraft
was
the
work
of
the
race
and
that
your
people
can
therefore
justly
share
in
the
pride
which
it
awakens
it
is
not
only
one
of
the
great
achievements
of
that
but
also
one
of
the
great
monuments
of
human
progress
it
illustrates
the
possibilities
of
true
democracy
in
its
best
estate
when
the
moral
anarchy
out
of
which
it
was
born
is
called
to
mind
it
can
be
truly
said
that
while
sown
in
weakness
it
was
raised
in
power
to
the
succeeding
ages
it
will
be
a
flaming
beacon
and
everywhere
men
who
are
confronted
with
the
acute
problems
of
this
complex
age
can
take
encouragement
from
the
fact
that
a
small
and
weak
people
when
confronted
with
similar
problems
had
the
strength
and
will
to
impose
restraint
upon
themselves
by
peacefully
proclaiming
in
the
simple
words
of
the
noble
preamble
to
the
constitution
we
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
order
to
form
a
more
perfect
union
establish
justice
ensure
domestic
tranquillity
provide
for
the
common
defence
promote
the
general
welfare
and
secure
the
blessings
of
liberty
to
ourselves
and
our
posterity
do
ordain
and
establish
this
constitution
for
the
united
states
of
america
note
the
words
ordain
and
establish
they
imply
perpetuity
they
make
no
provision
for
the
secession
of
any
state
even
if
it
deems
itself
aggrieved
by
federal
action
and
yet
the
right
to
secede
was
urged
for
many
years
but
lincoln
completed
the
work
of
washington
franklin
madison
and
hamilton
by
establishing
that
a
government
for
the
people
by
the
people
and
of
the
people
should
not
perish
from
the
earth
the
revolt
against
where
there
is
no
vision
the
people
perish
but
he
that
keepeth
the
law
happy
is
he
proverbs
xxix
one
of
the
most
quoted
and
also
proverbs
of
the
wise
solomon
says
as
translated
in
the
authorized
version
where
there
is
no
vision
the
people
perish
what
solomon
actually
said
was
where
there
is
no
vision
the
people
off
the
translator
thus
confused
an
effect
with
a
cause
what
was
the
vision
to
which
the
wise
man
referred
the
rest
of
the
proverb
which
is
rarely
quoted
explains
where
there
is
no
vision
the
people
cast
off
restraint
he
that
keepeth
the
law
happy
is
the
vision
then
is
the
authority
of
law
and
solomon
warning
is
that
to
which
the
great
and
noble
founder
of
pennsylvania
william
penn
many
centuries
later
gave
utterance
when
he
said
that
government
is
free
to
the
people
under
it
where
the
laws
rule
and
the
people
are
a
party
to
those
laws
and
all
the
rest
is
tyranny
oligarchy
and
confusion
it
is
my
present
purpose
to
discuss
the
moral
psychology
of
the
present
revolt
against
the
spirit
of
authority
too
little
consideration
has
been
paid
by
the
legal
profession
to
questions
of
moral
psychology
these
have
been
left
to
metaphysicians
and
ecclesiastics
and
yet
to
paraphrase
the
saying
of
the
master
the
laws
were
made
for
man
and
not
man
for
the
laws
and
if
the
science
of
the
law
ignores
the
study
of
human
nature
and
attempts
to
conform
man
to
the
laws
rather
than
the
laws
to
man
then
its
development
is
a
very
partial
and
imperfect
one
let
me
first
be
sure
of
my
premises
is
there
in
this
day
and
generation
a
spirit
of
lawlessness
greater
or
different
than
that
that
has
always
characterized
human
society
such
spirit
of
revolt
against
authority
has
always
existed
even
when
the
penalty
of
death
was
visited
upon
nearly
all
offences
against
life
and
property
blackstone
tells
us
book
iv
chap
i
that
in
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
a
capital
offence
to
cut
down
a
cherry
tree
in
an
orchard
a
drastic
penalty
which
should
increase
our
admiration
for
george
washington
courage
and
veracity
we
are
apt
to
see
the
past
in
a
golden
haze
which
obscures
our
vision
thus
we
think
of
william
penn
holy
experiment
on
the
banks
of
the
delaware
as
the
realization
of
sir
thomas
more
dream
of
utopia
and
yet
pennsylvania
was
somewhat
intemperately
called
in
the
greatest
refuge
for
pirates
and
rogues
in
america
and
penn
himself
wrote
about
that
time
that
he
had
heard
of
no
place
which
was
more
overrun
with
wickedness
than
his
city
of
brotherly
love
where
things
were
so
openly
committed
in
defiance
of
law
and
virtue
facts
so
foul
that
i
am
forbid
by
common
modesty
to
relate
them
conceding
that
lawlessness
is
not
a
novel
phenomenon
is
not
the
present
time
characterized
by
an
exceptional
revolt
against
the
authority
of
law
the
statistics
of
our
criminal
courts
show
in
recent
years
an
unprecedented
growth
in
crimes
thus
in
the
federal
courts
pending
criminal
indictments
have
increased
from
in
the
year
to
over
in
the
year
while
this
abnormal
increase
is
in
part
due
to
sumptuary
legislation
for
approximately
cases
now
pending
arise
under
the
prohibition
statutes
yet
eliminating
these
there
yet
remains
an
increase
in
nine
years
of
over
per
cent
in
the
comparatively
narrow
sphere
of
the
federal
criminal
jurisdiction
i
have
been
unable
to
get
the
data
from
the
state
courts
but
the
growth
of
crimes
can
be
measured
by
a
few
illustrative
statistics
thus
the
losses
from
burglaries
which
have
been
repaid
by
casualty
companies
have
grown
in
amount
from
in
to
over
in
and
in
a
like
period
embezzlements
have
increased
it
is
notorious
that
the
thefts
from
the
mails
and
express
companies
and
other
carriers
have
grown
to
enormous
proportions
the
of
railroad
trains
is
now
of
frequent
occurrence
and
is
not
confined
to
the
unsettled
sections
of
the
country
not
only
in
the
united
states
but
even
in
europe
such
crimes
of
violence
are
of
increasing
frequency
and
a
recent
dispatch
from
berne
under
date
of
august
stated
that
the
famous
international
expresses
of
europe
were
now
run
under
a
military
guard
the
streets
of
our
cities
once
reasonably
secure
from
crimes
of
violence
have
now
become
the
field
of
operations
for
the
and
highwayman
the
days
of
dick
turpin
and
jack
sheppard
have
returned
with
this
serious
difference
that
the
turpins
and
sheppards
of
our
day
are
not
dependent
upon
the
horse
but
have
the
powerful
automobile
to
facilitate
their
crimes
and
make
sure
their
escape
thus
in
chicago
alone
automobiles
were
stolen
in
a
single
year
once
murder
was
an
infrequent
and
abnormal
crime
in
our
large
cities
it
is
of
almost
daily
occurrence
in
new
york
in
there
were
murders
and
only
convictions
in
and
convictions
in
chicago
in
there
were
and
convictions
when
the
crime
wave
was
at
its
height
a
year
ago
the
police
authorities
in
more
than
one
american
city
confessed
their
impotence
to
impose
effective
restraints
life
and
property
had
seemingly
become
almost
as
insecure
as
during
the
middle
ages
footnote
the
reader
will
bear
in
mind
that
these
words
were
spoken
in
august
unquestionably
the
situation
has
greatly
improved
during
the
present
year
as
to
the
subtler
and
more
insidious
crimes
against
the
political
state
it
is
enough
to
say
that
graft
has
become
a
science
in
city
state
and
nation
losses
by
such
misapplication
of
public
funds
piled
pelion
on
ossa
no
longer
run
in
the
millions
but
the
hundreds
of
millions
our
city
governments
are
in
many
instances
foul
cancers
on
the
body
politic
and
for
us
to
boast
of
having
solved
the
problem
of
local
is
as
fatuous
as
for
a
strong
man
to
exult
in
his
health
when
his
body
is
covered
with
running
sores
it
has
been
estimated
that
the
annual
profits
from
violations
of
the
prohibition
laws
have
reached
men
who
thus
violate
these
laws
for
sordid
gain
are
not
likely
to
obey
other
laws
and
the
respect
for
law
among
all
classes
steadily
diminishes
as
our
people
become
familiar
with
and
tolerant
to
wholesale
criminality
whether
the
moral
and
economic
results
of
prohibition
overbalance
this
rising
wave
of
crime
time
will
tell
let
us
note
the
significant
fact
that
this
spirit
of
revolt
against
authority
is
not
confined
to
the
political
state
and
therefore
its
causes
lie
beyond
that
sphere
of
human
action
human
life
is
governed
by
all
manner
of
laws
laws
of
art
of
social
intercourse
of
literature
music
business
all
evolved
by
custom
and
imposed
by
the
collective
will
of
society
here
we
find
the
same
revolt
against
tradition
and
authority
in
music
its
fundamental
canons
have
been
thrown
aside
and
discord
has
been
substituted
for
harmony
as
its
ideal
its
culmination
jazz
is
a
musical
crime
if
the
forms
of
dancing
and
music
are
symptomatic
of
an
age
what
shall
be
said
of
the
universal
craze
to
indulge
in
crude
and
clumsy
dancing
to
the
vile
discords
of
jazz
music
the
cry
of
the
time
is
on
with
the
dance
let
joy
be
unrefined
in
the
plastic
arts
the
laws
of
form
and
the
criteria
of
beauty
have
been
swept
aside
by
the
futurists
cubists
vorticists
tactilists
and
other
aesthetic
bolsheviki
in
poetry
where
beauty
of
rhythm
melody
of
sound
and
nobility
of
thought
were
once
regarded
as
the
true
tests
we
now
have
in
freak
forms
of
poetry
the
exaltation
of
the
grotesque
and
brutal
hundreds
of
poets
are
feebly
echoing
the
barbaric
yawp
of
walt
whitman
without
the
redeeming
merit
of
his
occasional
sublimity
of
thought
in
commerce
the
revolt
is
against
the
purity
of
standards
and
the
integrity
of
business
morals
who
can
question
that
this
is
the
age
of
the
sham
and
the
counterfeit
science
is
prostituted
to
deceive
the
public
by
cloaking
the
increasing
deterioration
in
quality
of
merchandise
the
blatant
medium
of
advertising
has
become
so
mendacious
as
to
defeat
its
own
purpose
in
the
recent
deflation
in
commodity
values
there
was
widespread
welching
among
business
men
who
had
theretofore
been
classed
as
reputable
of
course
i
recognize
that
a
far
greater
number
kept
their
contracts
even
when
it
brought
them
to
the
verge
of
ruin
but
when
in
the
history
of
american
business
was
there
such
a
volume
of
broken
faith
as
in
the
drastic
deflation
of
in
the
greater
sphere
of
social
life
we
find
the
same
revolt
against
the
institutions
which
have
the
sanction
of
the
past
social
laws
which
mark
the
decent
restraints
of
print
speech
and
dress
have
in
recent
decades
been
increasingly
disregarded
the
very
foundations
of
the
great
and
primitive
institutions
of
mankind
like
the
family
the
church
and
the
state
have
been
shaken
nature
itself
is
defied
thus
the
fundamental
difference
of
sex
is
disregarded
by
social
and
political
movements
which
ignore
the
permanent
differentiation
of
social
function
ordained
by
nature
all
these
are
but
illustrations
of
the
general
revolt
against
the
authority
of
the
past
a
revolt
that
can
be
measured
by
the
change
in
the
fundamental
presumption
of
men
with
respect
to
the
value
of
human
experience
in
all
former
ages
all
that
was
in
the
past
was
presumptively
true
and
the
burden
was
upon
him
who
sought
to
change
it
the
human
mind
apparently
regards
the
lessons
of
the
past
as
presumptively
false
and
the
burden
is
upon
him
who
seeks
to
invoke
them
lest
i
be
accused
of
undue
pessimism
let
me
cite
as
a
witness
one
who
of
all
men
is
probably
best
equipped
to
express
an
opinion
upon
the
moral
state
of
the
world
i
refer
to
the
venerable
head
of
that
religious
organization
which
with
its
trained
representatives
in
every
part
of
the
world
is
probably
better
informed
as
to
its
spiritual
state
than
any
other
organization
footnote
reference
is
to
the
late
pope
benedict
speaking
last
christmas
eve
in
an
address
to
the
college
of
cardinals
the
venerable
pontiff
gave
expression
to
an
estimate
of
present
conditions
which
should
have
attracted
far
greater
attention
than
it
apparently
did
the
pope
said
that
five
plagues
were
now
afflicting
humanity
the
first
was
the
unprecedented
challenge
to
authority
the
second
an
equally
unprecedented
hatred
between
man
and
man
the
third
was
the
abnormal
aversion
to
work
the
fourth
the
excessive
thirst
for
pleasure
as
the
great
aim
of
life
the
fifth
a
gross
materialism
which
denied
the
reality
of
the
spiritual
in
human
life
the
accuracy
of
this
indictment
will
commend
itself
to
men
who
like
myself
are
not
of
pope
benedict
communion
i
trust
that
i
have
already
shown
that
the
challenge
to
authority
is
universal
and
is
not
confined
to
that
of
the
political
state
even
in
the
narrower
confine
of
the
latter
the
fires
of
revolution
are
either
violently
burning
or
at
least
smouldering
two
of
the
oldest
empires
in
the
world
which
together
have
more
than
half
of
its
population
china
and
russia
are
in
a
welter
of
anarchy
while
many
lesser
nations
are
in
a
stage
of
submerged
revolt
if
the
revolt
were
confined
to
autocratic
governments
we
might
see
in
it
merely
a
reaction
against
tyranny
but
even
in
the
most
stable
of
democracies
and
among
the
most
enlightened
peoples
the
underground
rumblings
of
revolution
may
be
heard
the
government
of
italy
has
been
preserved
from
overthrow
not
alone
by
its
constituted
authorities
but
by
a
band
of
resolute
men
called
the
fascisti
who
have
taken
the
law
into
their
own
hands
as
did
the
vigilance
committees
in
western
mining
camps
to
put
down
worse
disorders
even
england
the
mother
of
democracies
and
the
most
stable
of
all
governments
in
the
maintenance
of
law
has
been
shaken
to
its
very
foundations
in
the
last
three
years
when
powerful
groups
of
men
attempted
to
seize
the
state
by
the
throat
and
compel
submission
to
their
demands
by
threatening
to
starve
the
community
this
would
be
serious
enough
if
it
were
only
the
struggle
between
capital
and
labour
and
had
only
involved
the
conditions
of
manual
toil
but
the
insurrection
against
the
political
state
in
england
was
more
political
than
it
was
economic
it
marked
on
the
part
of
millions
of
men
a
portentous
decay
of
belief
in
representative
government
and
its
chosen
organ
the
ballot
box
great
and
powerful
groups
had
suddenly
discovered
and
it
may
be
the
most
portentous
political
discovery
of
the
twentieth
century
that
the
power
involved
in
their
control
over
the
necessaries
of
life
as
compared
with
the
power
of
the
voting
franchise
was
as
a
centimetre
cannon
to
the
bow
and
arrow
the
end
sought
to
be
attained
namely
the
nationalization
of
the
basic
industries
and
even
the
control
of
the
foreign
policy
of
great
britain
vindicated
the
truth
of
the
british
prime
minister
statement
that
these
great
strikes
involved
something
more
than
a
mere
struggle
over
the
conditions
of
labour
and
that
they
were
essentially
seditious
attempts
against
the
life
of
the
state
footnote
i
am
here
speaking
of
the
conditions
of
i
appreciate
the
great
improvement
which
seems
to
me
to
justify
the
patience
of
lloyd
george
nor
were
they
altogether
unsuccessful
for
when
the
armies
of
lenin
and
trotsky
were
at
the
gates
of
warsaw
in
the
summer
of
the
attempts
of
the
governments
of
england
and
belgium
to
afford
assistance
to
the
embattled
poles
were
paralysed
by
the
labour
groups
of
both
countries
who
threatened
a
general
strike
if
those
two
nations
joined
with
france
in
aiding
poland
to
resist
a
possibly
greater
menace
to
western
civilization
than
has
occurred
since
attila
and
his
huns
stood
on
the
banks
of
the
marne
of
greater
significance
to
the
welfare
of
civilization
is
the
complete
subversion
during
the
world
war
of
nearly
all
the
international
laws
which
had
been
slowly
built
up
in
a
thousand
years
these
principles
as
codified
by
the
two
hague
conventions
were
immediately
swept
aside
in
the
fierce
struggle
for
existence
and
civilized
man
with
his
liquid
fire
and
poison
gas
and
his
deliberate
attacks
upon
undefended
cities
and
their
women
and
children
waged
war
with
the
unrelenting
ferocity
of
primitive
times
surely
this
fierce
war
of
extermination
which
caused
the
loss
of
three
hundred
billion
dollars
in
property
and
thirty
millions
of
human
lives
did
mark
for
the
time
being
the
twilight
of
civilization
the
hands
on
the
dial
of
time
had
been
put
back
temporarily
let
us
hope
and
pray
a
thousand
years
nor
will
many
question
the
accuracy
of
the
second
count
in
pope
benedict
indictment
the
war
to
end
war
only
ended
in
unprecedented
hatred
between
nation
and
nation
class
and
class
and
man
and
man
victors
and
vanquished
are
involved
in
a
common
ruin
and
if
in
this
deluge
of
blood
which
has
submerged
the
world
there
is
a
mount
ararat
upon
which
the
ark
of
a
truer
and
better
peace
can
find
refuge
it
has
not
yet
appeared
above
the
troubled
surface
of
the
waters
still
less
can
one
question
the
closely
related
third
and
fourth
counts
in
pope
benedict
indictment
namely
the
unprecedented
aversion
to
work
when
work
is
most
needed
to
reconstruct
the
foundations
of
prosperity
or
the
excessive
thirst
for
pleasure
which
preceded
accompanied
and
now
has
followed
the
most
terrible
tragedy
in
the
annals
of
mankind
the
true
spirit
of
work
seems
to
have
vanished
from
millions
of
men
that
spirit
of
which
shakespeare
made
his
orlando
speak
when
he
said
of
his
true
servant
adam
o
good
old
man
how
well
in
thee
appears
the
constant
service
of
the
antique
world
when
service
sweat
for
duty
not
for
meed
the
of
our
industrial
civilization
has
been
shattered
work
for
work
sake
as
the
most
glorious
privilege
of
human
faculties
has
gone
both
as
an
ideal
and
as
a
potent
spirit
the
conception
of
work
as
a
degrading
servitude
to
be
done
with
reluctance
and
grudging
inefficiency
seems
to
be
the
ideal
of
millions
of
men
of
all
classes
and
in
all
countries
the
spirit
of
work
is
of
more
than
sentimental
importance
it
may
be
said
of
it
as
hamlet
says
of
death
the
readiness
is
all
all
of
us
are
conscious
of
the
fact
that
given
a
love
of
work
and
the
capacity
for
it
seems
almost
illimitable
as
witness
napoleon
with
his
power
or
shakespeare
who
in
twenty
years
could
write
more
than
twenty
masterpieces
on
the
other
hand
given
an
aversion
to
work
and
the
less
a
man
does
the
less
he
wants
to
do
or
is
seemingly
capable
of
doing
the
great
evil
of
the
world
is
this
aversion
to
work
as
the
mechanical
era
diminished
the
element
of
physical
exertion
in
work
we
would
have
supposed
that
man
would
have
sought
expression
for
his
physical
faculties
in
other
ways
on
the
contrary
the
whole
history
of
the
mechanical
era
is
a
persistent
struggle
for
more
pay
and
less
work
and
it
has
culminated
in
ruin
for
there
is
not
a
nation
in
civilization
which
is
not
now
in
the
throes
of
economic
distress
and
many
of
them
are
on
the
verge
of
ruin
in
my
judgment
the
economic
catastrophe
of
is
far
greater
than
the
catastrophe
of
the
results
of
these
two
tendencies
measured
in
the
statistics
of
productive
industry
are
literally
appalling
thus
in
italy
according
to
statistics
of
her
minister
of
labour
lost
days
of
work
because
of
strikes
alone
from
july
to
september
many
great
factories
were
in
the
hands
of
revolutionary
communists
a
full
third
of
these
strikes
had
for
their
end
political
and
not
economic
purposes
in
germany
the
progressive
revolt
of
labour
against
work
is
thus
measured
by
competent
authority
there
were
lost
in
strikes
in
working
days
in
and
in
even
in
our
own
favoured
land
the
same
phenomena
are
observable
in
the
state
of
new
york
alone
for
there
was
a
loss
due
to
strikes
of
over
working
days
in
all
countries
the
losses
by
such
cessations
from
labour
are
little
as
compared
with
those
due
to
the
spirit
which
in
england
is
called
or
the
shirking
of
performance
of
work
and
of
sabotage
which
means
the
deliberate
destruction
of
machinery
in
operation
everywhere
the
phenomenon
has
been
observed
that
with
the
highest
wages
known
in
the
history
of
modern
times
there
has
been
an
unmistakable
lessening
of
efficiency
and
that
with
an
increase
in
the
number
of
workers
there
has
been
a
decrease
in
output
thus
the
transportation
companies
in
the
united
states
have
seriously
made
a
claim
against
the
united
states
government
for
damages
to
their
roads
amounting
to
claimed
to
be
due
to
the
inefficiency
of
labour
during
the
period
of
governmental
operation
accompanying
this
indisposition
to
work
efficiently
has
been
a
mad
desire
for
pleasure
such
as
if
it
existed
in
like
measure
in
preceding
ages
has
not
been
seen
within
the
memory
of
living
man
man
has
danced
upon
the
verge
of
a
social
abyss
and
as
previously
suggested
the
dancing
has
both
in
form
and
in
accompanying
music
lost
its
former
grace
and
reverted
to
the
primitive
forms
of
crude
vulgarity
which
gives
the
spectators
the
maximum
of
emotional
expression
with
the
minimum
of
mental
effort
had
not
been
eclipsed
by
the
splendour
of
a
dempsey
or
a
carpentier
of
the
last
count
in
pope
benedict
indictment
i
shall
say
but
little
it
is
more
appropriate
for
the
members
of
that
great
and
noble
profession
which
is
more
intimately
concerned
with
the
spiritual
advance
of
mankind
it
is
enough
to
say
that
while
the
church
as
an
institution
continues
to
exist
the
belief
in
the
supernatural
and
even
in
the
spiritual
has
been
supplanted
in
the
souls
of
millions
of
men
by
a
gross
and
debasing
materialism
if
my
reader
agrees
with
me
in
my
premises
then
we
are
not
likely
to
disagree
in
the
conclusion
that
the
causes
of
these
grave
symptoms
are
not
ephemeral
or
superficial
but
must
have
their
origin
in
some
and
change
in
human
society
if
there
is
to
be
a
remedy
we
must
first
diagnose
this
malady
of
the
human
soul
for
example
let
us
not
lay
the
flattering
unction
to
our
souls
that
this
spirit
is
solely
the
reaction
of
the
great
war
the
present
weariness
and
lassitude
of
human
spirit
and
the
disappointment
and
disillusion
as
to
the
aftermath
of
the
harvest
of
blood
may
have
aggravated
but
they
could
not
cause
the
symptoms
of
which
i
speak
for
the
very
obvious
reason
that
all
these
symptoms
were
in
existence
and
apparent
to
a
few
discerning
men
for
decades
before
the
war
indeed
it
is
possible
that
the
world
war
far
from
causing
the
of
the
age
was
in
itself
but
one
of
its
many
symptoms
undoubtedly
there
are
many
contributing
causes
which
have
swollen
the
turbid
tide
of
this
revolution
against
the
spirit
of
authority
thus
the
multiplicity
of
laws
does
not
tend
to
develop
a
spirit
this
fact
has
often
been
noted
thus
napoleon
on
the
eve
of
the
brumaire
complained
that
france
with
a
thousand
folios
of
law
was
a
lawless
nation
unquestionably
the
political
state
suffers
in
authority
by
the
abuse
of
legislation
and
especially
by
the
appeal
to
law
to
curb
evils
that
are
best
left
to
individual
conscience
in
this
age
of
democracy
the
average
individual
is
too
apt
to
recognize
two
constitutions
one
the
constitution
of
the
state
and
the
second
an
unwritten
constitution
to
him
of
higher
authority
under
which
he
believes
that
no
law
is
obligatory
which
he
regards
as
in
excess
of
the
true
powers
of
government
of
this
latter
spirit
the
widespread
violation
of
the
prohibition
law
is
a
familiar
illustration
a
race
of
individualists
obey
reluctantly
when
they
obey
at
all
any
laws
which
they
regard
as
unreasonable
or
vexatious
indeed
they
are
increasingly
opposed
to
any
law
which
affects
their
selfish
interests
thus
many
good
women
are
involuntary
smugglers
they
deny
the
authority
of
the
state
to
impose
a
tax
upon
a
paquin
gown
the
law
delays
and
laxity
in
administration
breed
a
spirit
of
contempt
and
too
often
invite
men
to
take
the
law
into
their
own
hands
these
causes
are
so
familiar
that
their
statement
is
a
commonplace
proceeding
to
deeper
and
less
recognized
causes
some
would
attribute
this
spirit
of
lawlessness
to
the
rampant
individualism
which
began
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
which
has
steadily
and
naturally
grown
with
the
advance
of
democratic
institutions
undoubtedly
the
excessive
emphasis
upon
the
rights
of
man
which
marked
the
political
upheaval
of
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
and
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
has
contributed
to
this
malady
of
the
age
men
talked
and
still
talk
loudly
of
their
rights
but
too
rarely
of
their
duties
and
yet
if
we
were
to
attribute
the
malady
merely
to
excessive
individualism
we
would
again
err
in
mistaking
a
symptom
for
a
cause
to
diagnose
truly
this
malady
we
must
look
to
some
cause
that
is
coterminous
in
time
with
the
disease
itself
and
which
has
been
operative
throughout
civilization
we
must
seek
some
widespread
change
in
social
conditions
for
man
essential
nature
has
changed
but
little
and
the
change
must
therefore
be
of
environment
i
know
of
but
one
such
change
that
is
sufficiently
widespread
and
to
account
adequately
for
this
malady
of
our
time
beginning
with
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
continuing
throughout
the
nineteenth
a
prodigious
transformation
has
taken
place
in
the
environment
of
man
which
has
done
more
to
revolutionize
the
conditions
of
human
life
than
all
the
changes
that
had
taken
place
in
the
preceding
years
which
science
has
attributed
to
man
life
on
the
planet
up
to
the
period
of
watt
discovery
of
steam
vapour
as
a
motive
power
these
conditions
so
far
as
the
principal
facilities
of
life
were
substantially
those
of
the
civilization
which
developed
eighty
centuries
ago
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
and
later
on
the
euphrates
man
had
indeed
increased
his
conquest
over
nature
in
later
centuries
by
a
few
mechanical
inventions
such
as
gunpowder
telescope
magnetic
needle
spinning
jenny
and
but
the
characteristic
of
all
those
inventions
with
the
exception
of
gunpowder
was
that
they
still
remained
a
subordinate
auxiliary
to
the
physical
strength
and
mental
skill
of
man
in
other
words
man
still
dominated
the
machine
and
there
was
still
full
play
for
his
physical
and
mental
faculties
moreover
all
the
inventions
of
preceding
ages
from
the
first
fashioning
of
the
flint
to
the
and
the
press
were
all
conquests
of
the
tangible
and
visible
forces
of
nature
with
watt
utilization
of
steam
vapour
as
a
motive
power
man
suddenly
passed
into
a
new
and
portentous
chapter
of
his
varied
history
thenceforth
he
was
to
multiply
his
powers
a
thousandfold
by
the
utilization
of
the
invisible
powers
of
nature
such
as
vapour
and
electricity
this
prodigious
change
in
his
powers
and
therefore
his
environment
has
proceeded
with
speed
man
has
suddenly
become
the
superman
like
the
giants
of
the
ancient
fable
he
has
stormed
the
very
ramparts
of
divine
power
or
like
prometheus
he
has
stolen
fire
of
omnipotent
forces
from
heaven
itself
for
his
use
his
voice
can
now
reach
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
and
taking
wing
in
his
aeroplane
he
can
fly
in
one
swift
flight
from
nova
scotia
to
england
or
he
can
leave
lausanne
and
resting
upon
the
icy
summit
of
mont
blanc
thus
like
the
herald
mercury
on
a
hill
he
can
again
plunge
into
the
void
and
thus
outfly
the
eagles
themselves
in
thus
acquiring
from
the
forces
of
nature
almost
illimitable
power
he
has
minimized
the
necessity
for
his
own
physical
exertion
or
even
mental
skill
the
machine
now
not
only
acts
for
him
but
too
often
for
him
is
it
surprising
that
so
portentous
a
change
should
have
fevered
his
brain
and
disturbed
his
mental
equilibrium
a
new
ideal
which
he
proudly
called
progress
obsessed
him
the
ideal
of
quantity
and
not
quality
his
practical
religion
became
that
of
acceleration
and
facilitation
to
do
things
more
quickly
and
easily
and
thus
to
minimize
exertion
became
his
great
objective
less
and
less
he
relied
upon
the
initiative
of
his
own
brain
and
muscle
and
more
and
more
he
put
his
faith
in
the
power
of
machinery
to
relieve
him
of
labour
the
evil
of
our
age
is
that
its
values
are
all
false
it
overrates
speed
it
underrates
sureness
it
overrates
the

underrates
the

it
overrates
automatic

it

it
underrates
individual
responsibility
we
glory
in
the
fact
that
we
can
talk
a
thousand
miles
but
we
ignore
the
greater
question
whether
when
we
thus
stentor
we
have
anything
worth
saying
we
have
now
made
the
serene
spaces
of
the
upper
heavens
our
media
to
transmit
market
reports
and
sporting
news
music
and
worse
oratory
and
in
the
meantime
the
great
masters
of
thought
homer
and
shakespeare
bach
and
beethoven
remain
unbidden
on
our
library
shelves
what
a
sordid
vanity
fair
is
our
modern
civilization
this
incalculable
multiplication
of
power
has
intoxicated
man
the
lust
has
obsessed
him
without
regard
to
whether
it
be
constructive
or
destructive
quantity
not
quality
becomes
the
great
objective
man
consumes
the
treasures
of
the
earth
faster
than
he
produces
them
deforesting
its
surface
and
disembowelling
its
hidden
wealth
as
he
feverishly
multiplied
the
things
he
desired
even
more
feverishly
he
multiplied
his
wants
to
gain
these
man
sought
the
congested
centres
of
human
life
while
the
world
as
a
whole
is
not
the
leading
countries
of
civilization
were
subjected
to
this
tremendous
pressure
europe
which
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
barely
numbered
people
suddenly
grew
nearly
millions
left
the
farms
to
gather
into
the
cities
to
exploit
their
new
and
seemingly
easy
conquest
over
nature
in
the
united
states
as
recently
as
only
per
cent
of
the
people
were
crowded
in
the
cities
per
cent
remained
upon
the
farms
and
still
followed
that
occupation
which
of
all
occupations
still
preserves
in
its
integrity
the
dominance
of
human
labour
over
the
machine
per
cent
of
the
population
is
in
the
cities
and
with
many
of
them
existence
is
both
feverish
and
artificial
while
they
have
employment
many
of
them
do
not
themselves
work
but
spend
their
lives
in
watching
machines
work
the
result
has
been
a
minute
subdivision
of
labour
that
has
denied
to
many
workers
the
true
significance
and
physical
benefit
of
labour
the
direct
results
of
this
excessive
tendency
to
specialization
whereby
not
only
the
work
but
the
worker
becomes
divided
into
mere
fragments
are
threefold
hobson
in
his
work
on
john
ruskin
thus
classifies
them
in
the
first
place
due
to
the
confinement
to
a
single
action
in
which
the
elements
of
human
skill
or
strength
are
largely
eliminated
secondly
in
the
assimilation
of
man
to
a
machine
whereby
seemingly
the
machine
dominates
man
and
not
man
the
machine
and
thirdly
in
that
work
became
dissociated
in
the
mind
of
the
worker
with
any
complete
or
satisfying
achievement
the
worker
does
not
see
the
fruit
of
his
travail
and
can
not
therefore
be
truly
satisfied
to
spend
one
life
in
opening
a
valve
to
make
a
part
of
a
pin
is
as
ruskin
pointed
out
demoralizing
in
its
tendencies
the
clerk
who
only
operates
an
adding
machine
has
little
opportunity
for
thus
millions
of
men
have
lost
both
the
opportunity
for
real
physical
exertion
the
incentive
to
work
in
the
joyous
competition
of
skill
and
finally
the
reward
of
work
in
the
sense
of
achievement
more
serious
than
this
however
has
been
the
destructive
effort
of
quantity
the
great
object
of
the
mechanical
age
at
the
expense
of
quality
take
for
example
the
no
one
can
question
the
immense
advantages
which
have
flowed
from
the
increased
facility
for
transmitting
ideas
but
may
it
not
be
true
that
the
thousandfold
increase
in
such
transmission
by
the
rotary
press
has
also
tended
to
muddy
the
current
thought
of
the
time
true
it
is
that
the
has
piled
up
great
treasures
of
human
knowledge
which
make
this
age
the
richest
in
accessible
information
i
am
not
speaking
of
knowledge
but
rather
of
the
current
thought
of
the
living
generation
i
gravely
question
whether
it
has
the
same
clarity
as
the
brain
of
the
generation
which
fashioned
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
our
fathers
could
not
talk
over
the
telephone
for
three
thousand
miles
but
have
we
surpassed
them
in
thoughts
of
enduring
value
washington
and
franklin
could
not
travel
sixty
miles
an
hour
in
a
railroad
train
or
twice
that
speed
in
an
aeroplane
but
does
it
follow
that
they
did
not
travel
to
as
good
purpose
as
we
who
scurry
to
and
fro
like
the
ants
in
a
disordered
unquestionably
man
of
has
a
thousand
ideas
suggested
to
him
by
the
newspaper
and
the
library
where
our
ancestors
had
one
but
have
we
the
same
spirit
of
calm
inquiry
and
do
we
the
facts
we
know
as
wisely
as
our
ancestors
did
athens
in
the
days
of
pericles
had
but
thirty
thousand
people
and
few
mechanical
inventions
but
she
produced
philosophers
poets
and
artists
whose
work
after
more
than
twenty
centuries
still
remain
the
despair
of
the
imitators
shakespeare
had
a
theatre
with
the
ground
as
its
floor
and
the
sky
as
its
ceiling
but
new
york
which
has
fifty
theatres
and
annually
spends
in
the
box
offices
of
its
varied
amusement
resorts
has
rarely
in
two
centuries
produced
a
play
that
has
lived
man
has
a
cinematographic
brain
a
thousand
images
are
impressed
daily
upon
the
screen
of
his
consciousness
but
they
are
as
fleeting
as
moving
pictures
in
a
cinema
theatre
the
american
press
prints
every
year
over
issues
no
one
can
question
its
educational
possibilities
for
the
best
of
all
colleges
is
potentially
the
university
of
gutenberg
if
it
printed
only
the
truth
its
value
would
be
infinite
but
who
can
say
in
what
proportions
of
this
vast
volume
of
printed
matter
is
the
true
and
the
false
the
framers
of
the
constitution
had
few
books
and
fewer
newspapers
their
thoughts
were
few
and
simple
but
what
they
lacked
in
quantity
they
made
up
in
unsurpassed
quality
before
the
beginning
of
the
present
mechanical
age
the
current
of
living
thought
could
be
likened
to
a
mountain
stream
which
though
confined
within
narrow
banks
yet
had
waters
of
transparent
clearness
may
not
the
current
thought
of
our
time
be
compared
with
the
mighty
mississippi
in
the
period
of
a
spring
freshet
its
banks
are
wide
and
its
current
is
swift
but
the
turbid
stream
that
flows
onward
is
one
of
muddy
swirls
and
eddies
and
overflows
its
banks
to
their
destruction
the
great
indictment
however
of
the
present
age
of
mechanical
power
is
that
it
has
largely
destroyed
the
spirit
of
work
the
great
enigma
which
it
propounds
to
us
and
which
like
the
riddle
of
the
sphinx
we
will
solve
or
be
destroyed
is
this
the
increase
in
the
potential
of
human
power
through
thermodynamics
been
accompanied
by
a
corresponding
increase
in
the
potential
of
human
character
to
this
life
and
death
question
a
great
french
philosopher
le
bon
writing
in
replied
that
the
one
unmistakable
symptom
of
human
life
was
the
increasing
deterioration
in
human
character
and
a
great
physicist
has
described
the
symptom
as
the
progressive
enfeeblement
of
the
human
will
in
a
famous
book
written
at
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
max
nordau
as
a
pathologist
explains
this
tendency
by
arguing
that
our
complex
civilization
has
placed
too
great
a
strain
upon
the
limited
nervous
organization
of
man
a
great
financier
the
elder
morgan
once
said
of
an
existing
financial
condition
that
it
was
suffering
from
undigested
securities
and
paraphrasing
him
is
it
not
possible
that
man
is
suffering
from
undigested
achievements
and
that
his
salvation
must
lie
in
adaptation
to
a
new
environment
which
measured
by
any
standard
known
to
science
is
a
thousandfold
greater
in
this
year
of
grace
than
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
no
one
would
be
mad
enough
to
urge
such
a
retrogression
as
the
abandonment
of
machinery
would
involve
indeed
it
would
be
impossible
for
in
speaking
of
its
evils
i
freely
recognize
that
not
only
would
civilization
perish
without
its
beneficent
aid
but
that
every
step
forward
in
the
history
of
man
has
been
coincident
with
and
in
large
part
attributable
to
a
new
mechanical
invention
but
suppose
the
development
of
machinery
should
reach
a
stage
where
all
human
labour
was
eliminated
what
would
be
the
effect
on
man
the
answer
is
contained
in
an
experiment
which
sir
john
lubbock
made
with
a
tribe
of
ants
originally
the
most
voracious
and
militant
of
their
species
yet
when
denied
the
opportunity
for
exercise
and
freed
from
the
necessity
of
foraging
for
their
food
in
three
generations
they
became
anaemic
and
perished
take
from
man
the
opportunity
of
work
and
the
sense
of
pride
in
achievement
and
you
have
taken
from
him
the
very
life
of
his
existence
robert
burns
could
sing
as
he
drove
his
ploughshare
through
the
fields
of
ayr
millions
who
simply
watch
an
automatic
infallible
machine
which
requires
neither
strength
nor
skill
do
not
sing
at
their
work
but
too
many
curse
the
fate
which
has
chained
them
like
ixion
to
a
soulless
machine
the
evil
is
even
greater
the
specialization
of
our
modern
mechanical
civilization
has
caused
a
submergence
of
the
individual
into
the
group
or
class
man
is
fast
ceasing
to
be
the
unit
of
human
society
groups
are
becoming
the
new
units
this
is
true
of
all
classes
of
men
the
employer
as
well
as
the
employee
the
true
justification
for
the
american
statutes
including
the
sherman
law
lies
not
so
much
in
the
realm
of
economics
as
in
that
of
morals
with
the
submergence
of
the
individual
whether
he
be
capitalist
or
into
a
group
there
has
followed
the
dissipation
of
moral
responsibility
a
mass
morality
has
been
substituted
for
individual
morality
and
unfortunately
group
morality
generally
intensifies
the
vices
more
than
the
virtues
of
man
possibly
the
greatest
result
of
the
mechanical
age
is
this
spirit
of
organization
its
merits
are
manifold
and
do
not
require
statement
but
they
have
blinded
us
to
the
demerits
of
excessive
organization
we
are
now
beginning
to
see
slowly
but
surely
that
a
faculty
of
organization
which
as
such
submerged
the
spirit
of
individualism
is
not
an
unmixed
good
indeed
the
moral
lesson
of
the
tragedy
of
germany
is
the
demoralizing
influence
of
organization
carried
to
the
power
no
nation
was
ever
more
highly
organized
than
this
modern
state
physically
intellectually
and
spiritually
it
had
become
a
highly
developed
machine
its
dominating
mechanical
spirit
so
submerged
the
individual
that
in
the
paradox
was
observed
of
an
enlightened
nation
that
was
seemingly
destitute
of
a
conscience
what
was
true
of
germany
however
was
true
although
in
lesser
degree
of
all
civilized
nations
in
all
of
them
the
individual
had
been
submerged
in
group
formations
and
the
effect
upon
the
character
of
man
has
been
destructive
of
his
nobler
self
this
may
explain
the
paradox
of
progress
it
may
be
likened
to
a
great
wheel
which
from
the
increasing
domination
of
mechanical
forces
developed
an
speed
until
by
centrifugal
action
it
went
off
its
bearings
in
and
caused
an
unprecedented
catastrophe
as
man
slowly
pulls
himself
out
of
that
gigantic
wreck
and
recovers
consciousness
he
begins
to
realize
that
speed
is
not
necessarily
progress
of
all
this
the
nineteenth
century
in
its
exultant
pride
in
its
conquest
of
the
invisible
forces
was
almost
blind
it
not
only
accepted
progress
as
an
unmistakable
fact
mistaking
however
acceleration
and
facilitation
for
progress
but
in
its
mad
folly
believed
in
an
immutable
law
of
progress
which
working
with
the
blind
forces
of
machinery
would
propel
man
forward
a
few
men
however
standing
on
the
mountain
ranges
of
human
observation
saw
the
future
more
clearly
than
did
the
mass
emerson
carlyle
ruskin
samuel
butler
and
max
nordau
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
in
our
time
ferrero
all
pointed
out
the
inevitable
dangers
of
the
excessive
mechanization
of
human
society
the
prophecies
were
unhappily
as
little
heeded
as
those
of
cassandra
one
can
see
the
tragedy
of
the
time
as
a
few
saw
it
in
comparing
the
first
of
alfred
tennyson
written
in
with
its
abiding
faith
in
the
increasing
purpose
of
the
ages
and
its
roseate
prophecies
of
the
golden
age
when
the
would
throb
no
longer
and
the
battle
flags
be
furled
in
the
parliament
of
man
and
the
federation
of
the
world
and
the
later
written
sixty
years
later
when
the
great
spiritual
poet
of
our
time
gave
utterance
to
the
dark
pessimism
which
flooded
his
soul
gone
the
cry
of
forward
lost
within
a
growing
gloom
lost
or
only
heard
in
silence
from
the
silence
of
a
tomb
half
the
marvels
of
my
morning
triumphs
over
time
and
space
staled
by
frequence
shrunk
by
usage
into
commonest
commonplace
evolution
ever
climbing
after
some
ideal
good
and
reversion
ever
dragging
evolution
in
the
mud
is
it
well
that
while
we
range
with
science
glorying
in
the
time
city
children
soak
and
blacken
soul
and
sense
in
city
slime
am
i
unduly
pessimistic
i
fear
that
this
is
the
case
with
most
men
who
like
dante
have
crossed
their
fiftieth
year
and
find
themselves
in
a
dark
and
sombre
wood
my
reader
will
probably
subject
me
to
the
additional
reproach
that
i
suggest
no
remedy
there
are
many
palliatives
for
the
evils
which
i
have
discussed
to
rekindle
in
men
the
love
of
work
for
work
sake
and
the
spirit
of
discipline
which
the
lost
sense
of
human
solidarity
once
inspired
would
do
much
to
solve
the
problem
for
work
is
the
greatest
moral
force
in
the
world
but
i
must
frankly
add
that
i
have
neither
the
time
nor
the
qualifications
to
discuss
the
solution
of
this
grave
problem
if
we
of
this
generation
can
only
recognize
that
the
evil
exists
then
the
situation
is
not
past
remedy
for
man
has
never
yet
found
himself
in
a
blind
alley
of
negation
he
is
still
master
of
his
soul
and
captain
of
his
fate
and
to
me
the
most
encouraging
sign
of
the
times
is
the
persistent
evidence
of
contemporary
literature
that
thoughtful
men
now
recognize
that
much
of
our
boasted
progress
was
as
unreal
as
a
rainbow
while
the
temper
of
the
times
seems
for
the
moment
pessimistic
it
merely
marks
the
recognition
of
man
of
an
abyss
whose
existence
he
barely
suspected
but
over
which
his
indomitable
courage
will
yet
carry
him
i
have
faith
in
the
inextinguishable
spark
of
the
divine
which
is
in
the
human
soul
and
which
our
complex
mechanical
civilization
has
not
extinguished
of
this
the
world
war
was
in
itself
a
proof
all
the
horrible
resources
of
mechanics
and
chemistry
were
utilized
to
coerce
the
human
soul
and
all
proved
ineffectual
never
did
men
rise
to
greater
heights
of
or
show
a
greater
fidelity
even
unto
death
millions
went
to
their
graves
as
to
their
beds
for
an
ideal
and
when
that
is
possible
this
pandora
box
of
modern
civilization
which
contained
all
imaginable
evils
as
well
as
benefits
also
leaves
hope
behind
i
am
reminded
of
a
remark
that
the
great
roumanian
statesman
taku
jonescu
made
during
the
peace
conference
at
paris
when
asked
his
views
as
to
the
future
of
civilization
he
replied
judged
by
the
light
of
reason
there
is
but
little
hope
but
i
have
faith
in
inextinguishable
impulse
to
live
happily
that
can
not
be
affected
by
any
change
in
man
environment
for
even
when
the
retreated
from
the
advance
of
the
polar
cap
which
once
covered
europe
with
arctic
desolation
he
not
only
defied
the
elements
but
showed
even
then
the
love
of
the
sublime
by
beautifying
the
walls
of
his
icy
prison
with
those
mural
decorations
which
were
the
beginning
of
art
assuredly
the
man
of
with
the
rich
heritage
of
countless
ages
can
do
no
less
he
has
but
to
diagnose
the
evil
and
he
will
then
in
some
way
meet
it
but
what
can
law
do
in
this
warfare
against
the
blind
forces
of
nature
it
is
easy
to
exaggerate
the
value
of
all
political
institutions
for
they
are
generally
on
the
surface
of
human
life
and
do
not
reach
down
to
the
deep
of
human
nature
but
the
law
can
do
something
to
protect
the
soul
of
man
from
destruction
by
the
soulless
machine
it
can
defend
the
spirit
of
individualism
it
must
champion
the
human
soul
in
its
right
to
exercise
freely
the
faculties
of
mind
and
body
we
must
defend
the
right
to
work
against
those
who
would
either
destroy
or
degrade
it
we
must
defend
the
right
of
every
man
not
only
to
join
with
others
in
protecting
his
interests
whether
he
is
a
brain
worker
or
a
hand
worker
for
without
the
right
of
combination
the
individual
would
often
be
the
victim
of
giant
forces
but
we
must
vindicate
the
equal
right
of
an
individual
if
he
so
wills
to
depend
upon
his
own
strength
the
tendency
of
group
morality
to
standardize
man
and
thus
reduce
all
men
to
the
dead
level
of
an
average
mediocrity
is
one
that
the
law
should
combat
its
protection
should
be
given
to
those
of
superior
skill
and
diligence
who
ask
the
due
rewards
of
such
superiority
any
other
course
to
use
the
fine
phrase
of
thomas
jefferson
in
his
first
inaugural
is
to
take
from
the
mouth
of
labour
the
bread
it
has
earned
of
this
spirit
one
of
the
noblest
expressions
is
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
magna
charta
has
not
wholly
escaped
the
destructive
tendencies
of
a
mechanical
age
it
was
framed
at
the
very
end
of
the
age
and
at
a
time
when
the
spirit
of
individualism
was
in
full
flower
the
hardy
pioneers
who
with
their
axes
made
straight
the
pathway
of
an
advancing
civilization
were
sturdy
men
who
need
not
be
undervalued
to
us
of
the
mechanical
age
the
prairie
schooner
which
met
the
elemental
forces
of
nature
with
the
proud
challenge
pike
peak
or
bust
produced
as
fine
a
type
of
manhood
as
the
age
which
travels
either
in
ford
fliver
or
the
more
luxurious
the
constitution
was
framed
in
the
period
that
marked
the
passing
of
the
primitive
age
and
the
dawn
of
the
day
of
the
machine
watt
had
recently
discovered
the
potency
of
steam
vapour
as
a
motive
power
but
its
only
use
at
first
was
for
pumping
water
out
of
the
mines
when
the
framers
of
the
constitution
met
in
high
convention
in
philadelphia
in
the
summer
of
a
connecticut
yankee
john
fitch
was
then
also
working
in
philadelphia
upon
his
steamboat
but
twenty
years
were
to
pass
before
the
prow
of
the
was
to
part
the
waters
of
the
hudson
and
nearly
a
half
century
before
transportation
was
to
be
revolutionized
by
the
utilization
of
watt
invention
in
the
locomotive
of
the
wonders
of
the
steamship
the
railroad
the
telegraphic
cable
the
wireless
the
gasoline
engine
and
a
thousand
other
mechanical
miracles
the
framers
of
the
american
constitution
did
not
even
dream
the
greatest
and
noblest
purpose
of
the
constitution
was
not
alone
to
hold
in
nicest
equipose
the
relative
powers
of
the
nation
and
the
states
but
also
to
maintain
in
the
scales
of
justice
a
true
equilibrium
between
the
rights
of
government
and
the
rights
of
an
individual
it
did
not
believe
that
the
state
was
omnipotent
or
infallible
and
yet
it
proclaimed
its
authority
within
wise
and
just
limits
it
defended
the
integrity
of
the
human
soul
in
other
governments
these
fundamental
decencies
of
liberty
rest
upon
the
conscience
of
the
legislature
under
the
american
constitution
they
are
part
of
the
fundamental
law
and
as
such
enforceable
by
judges
sworn
to
defend
the
integrity
of
the
individual
as
fully
as
the
integrity
of
the
state
when
did
a
nobler
vision
inspire
men
in
the
political
annals
of
mankind
without
that
vision
to
restrain
each
succeeding
generation
of
americans
from
the
tempting
excesses
of
political
power
the
american
commonwealth
with
its
great
heterogeneous
democracy
would
probably
perish
that
vision
still
remains
as
an
ideal
with
the
american
people
and
still
leads
them
to
achievements
for
in
all
the
mad
changes
of
a
frenzied
hour
they
have
not
yet
lost
faith
in
or
love
for
the
constitution
of
the
fathers
that
vision
will
remain
with
them
as
long
and
no
longer
as
there
is
in
their
hearts
a
conscious
and
willing
acquiescence
in
its
wisdom
and
justice
obviously
it
can
have
no
inherent
vigour
to
perpetuate
itself
if
it
ceases
to
be
of
the
spirit
of
the
people
then
the
yellow
parchment
whereon
it
is
inscribed
can
avail
nothing
when
that
parchment
was
last
taken
from
the
safe
in
the
state
department
the
ink
in
which
it
had
been
engrossed
nearly
years
ago
was
found
to
have
faded
all
who
believe
in
constitutional
government
must
hope
that
this
is
not
a
portentous
symbol
the
american
people
must
write
the
compact
not
with
ink
upon
parchment
but
with
letters
of
living
light
to
use
webster
phrase
upon
their
hearts
again
the
solemn
warning
of
the
wise
man
of
old
recurs
to
us
where
there
is
no
vision
the
people
perish
but
he
that
keepeth
the
law
happy
is
he
