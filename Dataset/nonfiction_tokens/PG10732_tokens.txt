a
further
selection
from
brought
together
under
a

which
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
original
and
does
not
claim
to
apply
to
every
chapter
in
the
volume
the
first
essay
is
in
the
main
a
rendering
of
the
philosopher
remarks
under
the
heading
of
zur

with
certain
parts
of
another

entitled
zur

der
bejahung
und
verneinung

such
omissions
as
i
have
made
are
directed
chiefly
by
the
desire
to
avoid
repeating
arguments
already
familiar
to
readers
of
the
other
volumes
in
this
series
the
on
sums
up
views
expressed
at
length
in
the
philosopher
chief
work
and
treated
again
in
the
the
in
this
and
the
previous
volume
practically
exhaust
the
chapter
of
the
original
which
bears
this
title
the
essay
on
must
not
be
taken
in
jest
it
expresses
schopenhauer
serious
convictions
and
as
a
penetrating
observer
of
the
faults
of
humanity
he
may
be
allowed
a
hearing
on
a
question
which
is
just
now
receiving
a
good
deal
of
attention
among
us
on
the
sufferings
of
the
world
unless
is
the
direct
and
immediate
object
of
life
our
existence
must
entirely
fail
of
its
aim
it
is
absurd
to
look
upon
the
enormous
amount
of
pain
that
abounds
everywhere
in
the
world
and
originates
in
needs
and
necessities
inseparable
from
life
itself
as
serving
no
purpose
at
all
and
the
result
of
mere
chance
each
separate
misfortune
as
it
comes
seems
no
doubt
to
be
something
exceptional
but
misfortune
in
general
is
the
rule
i
know
of
no
greater
absurdity
than
that
propounded
by
most
systems
of
philosophy
in
declaring
evil
to
be
negative
in
its
character
evil
is
just
what
is
positive
it
makes
its
own
existence
felt
leibnitz
is
particularly
concerned
to
defend
this
absurdity
and
he
seeks
to
strengthen
his
position
by
using
a
palpable
and
paltry
sophism
it
is
the
good
which
is
negative
in
other
words
happiness
and
satisfaction
always
imply
some
desire
fulfilled
some
state
of
pain
brought
to
an
end
footnote
cf
leibnitz
argued
that
evil
is
a
negative
quality
the
absence
of
good
and
that
its
active
and
seemingly
positive
character
is
an
incidental
and
not
an
essential
part
of
its
nature
cold
he
said
is
only
the
absence
of
the
power
of
heat
and
the
active
power
of
expansion
in
freezing
water
is
an
incidental
and
not
an
essential
part
of
the
nature
of
cold
the
fact
is
that
the
power
of
expansion
in
freezing
water
is
really
an
increase
of
repulsion
amongst
its
molecules
and
schopenhauer
is
quite
right
in
calling
the
whole
argument
a
sophism
this
explains
the
fact
that
we
generally
find
pleasure
to
be
not
nearly
so
pleasant
as
we
expected
and
pain
very
much
more
painful
the
pleasure
in
this
world
it
has
been
said
outweighs
the
pain
or
at
any
rate
there
is
an
even
balance
between
the
two
if
the
reader
wishes
to
see
shortly
whether
this
statement
is
true
let
him
compare
the
respective
feelings
of
two
animals
one
of
which
is
engaged
in
eating
the
other
the
best
consolation
in
misfortune
or
affliction
of
any
kind
will
be
the
thought
of
other
people
who
are
in
a
still
worse
plight
than
yourself
and
this
is
a
form
of
consolation
open
to
every
one
but
what
an
awful
fate
this
means
for
mankind
as
a
whole
we
are
like
lambs
in
a
field
disporting
themselves
under
the
eye
of
the
butcher
who
chooses
out
first
one
and
then
another
for
his
prey
so
it
is
that
in
our
good
days
we
are
all
unconscious
of
the
evil
fate
may
have
presently
in
store
for
us
sickness
poverty
mutilation
loss
of
sight
or
reason
no
little
part
of
the
torment
of
existence
lies
in
this
that
time
is
continually
pressing
upon
us
never
letting
us
take
breath
but
always
coming
after
us
like
a
taskmaster
with
a
whip
if
at
any
moment
time
stays
his
hand
it
is
only
when
we
are
delivered
over
to
the
misery
of
boredom
but
misfortune
has
its
uses
for
as
our
bodily
frame
would
burst
asunder
if
the
pressure
of
the
atmosphere
was
removed
so
if
the
lives
of
men
were
relieved
of
all
need
hardship
and
adversity
if
everything
they
took
in
hand
were
successful
they
would
be
so
swollen
with
arrogance
that
though
they
might
not
burst
they
would
present
the
spectacle
of
unbridled
folly
nay
they
would
go
mad
and
i
may
say
further
that
a
certain
amount
of
care
or
pain
or
trouble
is
necessary
for
every
man
at
all
times
a
ship
without
ballast
is
unstable
and
will
not
go
straight
certain
it
is
that
worry
and
form
the
lot
of
almost
all
men
their
whole
life
long
but
if
all
wishes
were
fulfilled
as
soon
as
they
arose
how
would
men
occupy
their
lives
what
would
they
do
with
their
time
if
the
world
were
a
paradise
of
luxury
and
ease
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
where
every
jack
obtained
his
jill
at
once
and
without
any
difficulty
men
would
either
die
of
boredom
or
hang
themselves
or
there
would
be
wars
massacres
and
murders
so
that
in
the
end
mankind
would
inflict
more
suffering
on
itself
than
it
has
now
to
accept
at
the
hands
of
nature
in
early
youth
as
we
contemplate
our
coming
life
we
are
like
children
in
a
theatre
before
the
curtain
is
raised
sitting
there
in
high
spirits
and
eagerly
waiting
for
the
play
to
begin
it
is
a
blessing
that
we
do
not
know
what
is
really
going
to
happen
could
we
foresee
it
there
are
times
when
children
might
seem
like
innocent
prisoners
condemned
not
to
death
but
to
life
and
as
yet
all
unconscious
of
what
their
sentence
means
nevertheless
every
man
desires
to
reach
old
age
in
other
words
a
state
of
life
of
which
it
may
be
said
it
is
bad
and
it
will
be
worse
and
so
on
till
the
worst
of
all
if
you
try
to
imagine
as
nearly
as
you
can
what
an
amount
of
misery
pain
and
suffering
of
every
kind
the
sun
shines
upon
in
its
course
you
will
admit
that
it
would
be
much
better
if
on
the
earth
as
little
as
on
the
moon
the
sun
were
able
to
call
forth
the
phenomena
of
life
and
if
here
as
there
the
surface
were
still
in
a
crystalline
state
again
you
may
look
upon
life
as
an
unprofitable
episode
disturbing
the
blessed
calm
of
and
in
any
case
even
though
things
have
gone
with
you
tolerably
well
the
longer
you
live
the
more
clearly
you
will
feel
that
on
the
whole
life
is
disappointment
nay
a
if
two
men
who
were
friends
in
their
youth
meet
again
when
they
are
old
after
being
separated
for
a
the
chief
feeling
they
will
have
at
the
sight
of
each
other
will
be
one
of
complete
disappointment
at
life
as
a
whole
because
their
thoughts
will
be
carried
back
to
that
earlier
time
when
life
seemed
so
fair
as
it
lay
spread
out
before
them
in
the
rosy
light
of
dawn
promised
so
much
and
then
performed
so
little
this
feeling
will
so
completely
predominate
over
every
other
that
they
will
not
even
consider
it
necessary
to
give
it
words
but
on
either
side
it
will
be
silently
assumed
and
form
the
of
all
they
have
to
talk
about
he
who
lives
to
see
two
or
three
generations
is
like
a
man
who
sits
some
time
in
the
conjurer
booth
at
a
fair
and
witnesses
the
performance
twice
or
thrice
in
succession
the
tricks
were
meant
to
be
seen
only
once
and
when
they
are
no
longer
a
novelty
and
cease
to
deceive
their
effect
is
gone
while
no
man
is
much
to
be
envied
for
his
lot
there
are
countless
numbers
whose
fate
is
to
be
deplored
life
is
a
task
to
be
done
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
say
it
means
that
the
man
has
done
his
task
if
children
were
brought
into
the
world
by
an
act
of
pure
reason
alone
would
the
human
race
continue
to
exist
would
not
a
man
rather
have
so
much
sympathy
with
the
coming
generation
as
to
spare
it
the
burden
of
existence
or
at
any
rate
not
take
it
upon
himself
to
impose
that
burden
upon
it
in
cold
blood
i
shall
be
told
i
suppose
that
my
philosophy
is
comfortless
because
i
speak
the
truth
and
people
prefer
to
be
assured
that
everything
the
lord
has
made
is
good
go
to
the
priests
then
and
leave
philosophers
in
peace
at
any
rate
do
not
ask
us
to
accommodate
our
doctrines
to
the
lessons
you
have
been
taught
that
is
what
those
rascals
of
sham
philosophers
will
do
for
you
ask
them
for
any
doctrine
you
please
and
you
will
get
it
your
university
professors
are
bound
to
preach
optimism
and
it
is
an
easy
and
agreeable
task
to
upset
their
theories
i
have
reminded
the
reader
that
every
state
of
welfare
every
feeling
of
satisfaction
is
negative
in
its
character
that
is
to
say
it
consists
in
freedom
from
pain
which
is
the
positive
element
of
existence
it
follows
therefore
that
the
happiness
of
any
given
life
is
to
be
measured
not
by
its
joys
and
pleasures
but
by
the
extent
to
which
it
has
been
free
from
suffering
from
positive
evil
if
this
is
the
true
standpoint
the
lower
animals
appear
to
enjoy
a
happier
destiny
than
man
let
us
examine
the
matter
a
little
more
closely
however
varied
the
forms
that
human
happiness
and
misery
may
take
leading
a
man
to
seek
the
one
and
shun
the
other
the
material
basis
of
it
all
is
bodily
pleasure
or
bodily
pain
this
basis
is
very
restricted
it
is
simply
health
food
protection
from
wet
and
cold
the
satisfaction
of
the
sexual
instinct
or
else
the
absence
of
these
things
consequently
as
far
as
real
physical
pleasure
is
concerned
the
man
is
not
better
off
than
the
brute
except
in
so
far
as
the
higher
possibilities
of
his
nervous
system
make
him
more
sensitive
to
every
kind
of
pleasure
but
also
it
must
be
remembered
to
every
kind
of
pain
but
then
compared
with
the
brute
how
much
stronger
are
the
passions
aroused
in
him
what
an
immeasurable
difference
there
is
in
the
depth
and
vehemence
of
his
emotions
and
yet
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
all
to
produce
the
same
result
in
the
end
namely
health
food
clothing
and
so
on
the
chief
source
of
all
this
passion
is
that
thought
for
what
is
absent
and
future
which
with
man
exercises
such
a
powerful
influence
upon
all
he
does
it
is
this
that
is
the
real
origin
of
his
cares
his
hopes
his
fears
emotions
which
affect
him
much
more
deeply
than
could
ever
be
the
case
with
those
present
joys
and
sufferings
to
which
the
brute
is
confined
in
his
powers
of
reflection
memory
and
foresight
man
possesses
as
it
were
a
machine
for
condensing
and
storing
up
his
pleasures
and
his
sorrows
but
the
brute
has
nothing
of
the
kind
whenever
it
is
in
pain
it
is
as
though
it
were
suffering
for
the
first
time
even
though
the
same
thing
should
have
previously
happened
to
it
times
out
of
number
it
has
no
power
of
summing
up
its
feelings
hence
its
careless
and
placid
temper
how
much
it
is
to
be
envied
but
in
man
reflection
comes
in
with
all
the
emotions
to
which
it
gives
rise
and
taking
up
the
same
elements
of
pleasure
and
pain
which
are
common
to
him
and
the
brute
it
develops
his
susceptibility
to
happiness
and
misery
to
such
a
degree
that
at
one
moment
the
man
is
brought
in
an
instant
to
a
state
of
delight
that
may
even
prove
fatal
at
another
to
the
depths
of
despair
and
suicide
if
we
carry
our
analysis
a
step
farther
we
shall
find
that
in
order
to
increase
his
pleasures
man
has
intentionally
added
to
the
number
and
pressure
of
his
needs
which
in
their
original
state
were
not
much
more
difficult
to
satisfy
than
those
of
the
brute
hence
luxury
in
all
its
forms
delicate
food
the
use
of
tobacco
and
opium
spirituous
liquors
fine
clothes
and
the
thousand
and
one
things
than
he
considers
necessary
to
his
existence
and
above
and
beyond
all
this
there
is
a
separate
and
peculiar
source
of
pleasure
and
consequently
of
pain
which
man
has
established
for
himself
also
as
the
result
of
using
his
powers
of
reflection
and
this
occupies
him
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
value
nay
almost
more
than
all
his
other
interests
put
together
i
mean
ambition
and
the
feeling
of
honor
and
shame
in
plain
words
what
he
thinks
about
the
opinion
other
people
have
of
him
taking
a
thousand
forms
often
very
strange
ones
this
becomes
the
goal
of
almost
all
the
efforts
he
makes
that
are
not
rooted
in
physical
pleasure
or
pain
it
is
true
that
besides
the
sources
of
pleasure
which
he
has
in
common
with
the
brute
man
has
the
pleasures
of
the
mind
as
well
these
admit
of
many
gradations
from
the
most
innocent
trifling
or
the
merest
talk
up
to
the
highest
intellectual
achievements
but
there
is
the
accompanying
boredom
to
be
set
against
them
on
the
side
of
suffering
boredom
is
a
form
of
suffering
unknown
to
brutes
at
any
rate
in
their
natural
state
it
is
only
the
very
cleverest
of
them
who
show
faint
traces
of
it
when
they
are
domesticated
whereas
in
the
case
of
man
it
has
become
a
downright
scourge
the
crowd
of
miserable
wretches
whose
one
aim
in
life
is
to
fill
their
purses
but
never
to
put
anything
into
their
heads
offers
a
singular
instance
of
this
torment
of
boredom
their
wealth
becomes
a
punishment
by
delivering
them
up
to
misery
of
having
nothing
to
do
for
to
escape
it
they
will
rush
about
in
all
directions
traveling
here
there
and
everywhere
no
sooner
do
they
arrive
in
a
place
than
they
are
anxious
to
know
what
amusements
it
affords
just
as
though
they
were
beggars
asking
where
they
could
receive
a
dole
of
a
truth
need
and
boredom
are
the
two
poles
of
human
life
finally
i
may
mention
that
as
regards
the
sexual
relation
a
man
is
committed
to
a
peculiar
arrangement
which
drives
him
obstinately
to
choose
one
person
this
feeling
grows
now
and
then
into
a
more
or
less
passionate
love
which
is
the
source
of
little
pleasure
and
much
suffering
footnote
i
have
treated
this
subject
at
length
in
a
special
chapter
of
the
second
volume
of
my
chief
work
it
is
however
a
wonderful
thing
that
the
mere
addition
of
thought
should
serve
to
raise
such
a
vast
and
lofty
structure
of
human
happiness
and
misery
resting
too
on
the
same
narrow
basis
of
joy
and
sorrow
as
man
holds
in
common
with
the
brute
and
exposing
him
to
such
violent
emotions
to
so
many
storms
of
passion
so
much
convulsion
of
feeling
that
what
he
has
suffered
stands
written
and
may
be
read
in
the
lines
on
his
face
and
yet
when
all
is
told
he
has
been
struggling
ultimately
for
the
very
same
things
as
the
brute
has
attained
and
with
an
incomparably
smaller
expenditure
of
passion
and
pain
but
all
this
contributes
to
increase
the
measures
of
suffering
in
human
life
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
pleasures
and
the
pains
of
life
are
made
much
worse
for
man
by
the
fact
that
death
is
something
very
real
to
him
the
brute
flies
from
death
instinctively
without
really
knowing
what
it
is
and
therefore
without
ever
contemplating
it
in
the
way
natural
to
a
man
who
has
this
prospect
always
before
his
eyes
so
that
even
if
only
a
few
brutes
die
a
natural
death
and
most
of
them
live
only
just
long
enough
to
transmit
their
species
and
then
if
not
earlier
become
the
prey
of
some
other
animal
whilst
man
on
the
other
hand
manages
to
make
natural
death
the
rule
to
which
however
there
are
a
good
many
exceptions
the
advantage
is
on
the
side
of
the
brute
for
the
reason
stated
above
but
the
fact
is
that
man
attains
the
natural
term
of
years
just
as
seldom
as
the
brute
because
the
unnatural
way
in
which
he
lives
and
the
strain
of
work
and
emotion
lead
to
a
degeneration
of
the
race
and
so
his
goal
is
not
often
reached
the
brute
is
much
more
content
with
mere
existence
than
man
the
plant
is
wholly
so
and
man
finds
satisfaction
in
it
just
in
proportion
as
he
is
dull
and
obtuse
accordingly
the
life
of
the
brute
carries
less
of
sorrow
with
it
but
also
less
of
joy
when
compared
with
the
life
of
man
and
while
this
may
be
traced
on
the
one
side
to
freedom
from
the
torment
of
and
it
is
also
due
to
the
fact
that
in
any
real
sense
is
unknown
to
the
brute
it
is
thus
deprived
of
any
share
in
that
which
gives
us
the
most
and
best
of
our
joys
and
pleasures
the
mental
anticipation
of
a
happy
future
and
the
inspiriting
play
of
phantasy
both
of
which
we
owe
to
our
power
of
imagination
if
the
brute
is
free
from
care
it
is
also
in
this
sense
without
hope
in
either
case
because
its
consciousness
is
limited
to
the
present
moment
to
what
it
can
actually
see
before
it
the
brute
is
an
embodiment
of
present
impulses
and
hence
what
elements
of
fear
and
hope
exist
in
its
nature
and
they
do
not
go
very
far
arise
only
in
relation
to
objects
that
lie
before
it
and
within
reach
of
those
impulses
whereas
a
man
range
of
vision
embraces
the
whole
of
his
life
and
extends
far
into
the
past
and
future
following
upon
this
there
is
one
respect
in
which
brutes
show
real
wisdom
when
compared
with
us
i
mean
their
quiet
placid
enjoyment
of
the
present
moment
the
tranquillity
of
mind
which
this
seems
to
give
them
often
puts
us
to
shame
for
the
many
times
we
allow
our
thoughts
and
our
cares
to
make
us
restless
and
discontented
and
in
fact
those
pleasures
of
hope
and
anticipation
which
i
have
been
mentioning
are
not
to
be
had
for
nothing
the
delight
which
a
man
has
in
hoping
for
and
looking
forward
to
some
special
satisfaction
is
a
part
of
the
real
pleasure
attaching
to
it
enjoyed
in
advance
this
is
afterwards
deducted
for
the
more
we
look
forward
to
anything
the
less
satisfaction
we
find
in
it
when
it
comes
but
the
brute
enjoyment
is
not
anticipated
and
therefore
suffers
no
deduction
so
that
the
actual
pleasure
of
the
moment
comes
to
it
whole
and
unimpaired
in
the
same
way
too
evil
presses
upon
the
brute
only
with
its
own
intrinsic
weight
whereas
with
us
the
fear
of
its
coming
often
makes
its
burden
ten
times
more
grievous
it
is
just
this
characteristic
way
in
which
the
brute
gives
itself
up
entirely
to
the
present
moment
that
contributes
so
much
to
the
delight
we
take
in
our
domestic
pets
they
are
the
present
moment
personified
and
in
some
respects
they
make
us
feel
the
value
of
every
hour
that
is
free
from
trouble
and
annoyance
which
we
with
our
thoughts
and
preoccupations
mostly
disregard
but
man
that
selfish
and
heartless
creature
misuses
this
quality
of
the
brute
to
be
more
content
than
we
are
with
mere
existence
and
often
works
it
to
such
an
extent
that
he
allows
the
brute
absolutely
nothing
more
than
mere
bare
life
the
bird
which
was
made
so
that
it
might
rove
over
half
of
the
world
he
shuts
up
into
the
space
of
a
cubic
foot
there
to
die
a
slow
death
in
longing
and
crying
for
freedom
for
in
a
cage
it
does
not
sing
for
the
pleasure
of
it
and
when
i
see
how
man
misuses
the
dog
his
best
friend
how
he
ties
up
this
intelligent
animal
with
a
chain
i
feel
the
deepest
sympathy
with
the
brute
and
burning
indignation
against
its
master
we
shall
see
later
that
by
taking
a
very
high
standpoint
it
is
possible
to
justify
the
sufferings
of
mankind
but
this
justification
can
not
apply
to
animals
whose
sufferings
while
in
a
great
measure
brought
about
by
men
are
often
considerable
even
apart
from
their
agency
and
so
we
are
forced
to
ask
why
and
for
what
purpose
does
all
this
torment
and
agony
exist
there
is
nothing
here
to
give
the
will
pause
it
is
not
free
to
deny
itself
and
so
obtain
redemption
there
is
only
one
consideration
that
may
serve
to
explain
the
sufferings
of
animals
it
is
this
that
the
will
to
live
which
underlies
the
whole
world
of
phenomena
must
in
their
case
satisfy
its
cravings
by
feeding
upon
itself
this
it
does
by
forming
a
gradation
of
phenomena
every
one
of
which
exists
at
the
expense
of
another
i
have
shown
however
that
the
capacity
for
suffering
is
less
in
animals
than
in
man
any
further
explanation
that
may
be
given
of
their
fate
will
be
in
the
nature
of
hypothesis
if
not
actually
mythical
in
its
character
and
i
may
leave
the
reader
to
speculate
upon
the
matter
for
himself

between
the

and
the
ethics
of
the
hindoos
there
is
a
glaring
contrast
in
the
one
case
with
the
exception
it
must
be
confessed
of
plato
the
object
of
ethics
is
to
enable
a
man
to
lead
a
happy
life
in
the
other
it
is
to
free
and
redeem
him
from
life
altogether
as
is
directly
stated
in
the
very
first
words
of
the
allied
with
this
is
the
contrast
between
the
greek
and
the
christian
idea
of
death
it
is
strikingly
presented
in
a
visible
form
on
a
fine
antique
sarcophagus
in
the
gallery
of
florence
which
exhibits
in
relief
the
whole
series
of
ceremonies
attending
a
wedding
in
ancient
times

the
formal
offer
to
the
evening
when

lights

happy
couple

compare
with
that
the
christian
coffin
draped
in
mournful
black
and
surmounted
with
a
crucifix
how
much
significance
there
is
in
these
two
ways
of
finding
comfort
in
death
they
are
opposed
to
each
other
but
each
is
right
the
one
points
to
the
of
the
will
to
live
which
remains
sure
of
life
for
all
time
however
rapidly
its
forms
may
change
the
other
in
the
symbol
of
suffering
and
death
points
to
the
of
the
will
to
live
to
redemption
from
this
world
the
domain
of
death
and
devil
and
in
the
question
between
the
affirmation
and
the
denial
of
the
will
to
live
christianity
is
in
the
last
resort
right
the
contrast
which
the
new
testament
presents
when
compared
with
the
old
according
to
the
ecclesiastical
view
of
the
matter
is
just
that
existing
between
my
ethical
system
and
the
moral
philosophy
of
europe
the
old
testament
represents
man
as
under
the
dominion
of
law
in
which
however
there
is
no
redemption
the
new
testament
declares
law
to
have
failed
frees
man
from
its
dominion
and
in
its
stead
preaches
the
kingdom
of
grace
to
be
won
by
faith
love
of
neighbor
and
entire
sacrifice
of
self
this
is
the
path
of
redemption
from
the
evil
of
the
world
the
spirit
of
the
new
testament
is
undoubtedly
asceticism
however
your
protestants
and
rationalists
may
twist
it
to
suit
their
purpose
asceticism
is
the
denial
of
the
will
to
live
and
the
transition
from
the
old
testament
to
the
new
from
the
dominion
of
law
to
that
of
faith
from
justification
by
works
to
redemption
through
the
mediator
from
the
domain
of
sin
and
death
to
eternal
life
in
christ
means
when
taken
in
its
real
sense
the
transition
from
the
merely
moral
virtues
to
the
denial
of
the
will
to
live
my
philosophy
shows
the
metaphysical
foundation
of
justice
and
the
love
of
mankind
and
points
to
the
goal
to
which
these
virtues
necessarily
lead
if
they
are
practised
in
perfection
at
the
same
time
it
is
candid
in
confessing
that
a
man
must
turn
his
back
upon
the
world
and
that
the
denial
of
the
will
to
live
is
the
way
of
redemption
it
is
therefore
really
at
one
with
the
spirit
of
the
new
testament
whilst
all
other
systems
are
couched
in
the
spirit
of
the
old
that
is
to
say
theoretically
as
well
as
practically
their
result
is
judaism
mere
despotic
theism
in
this
sense
then
my
doctrine
might
be
called
the
only
true
christian
philosophy
however
paradoxical
a
statement
this
may
seem
to
people
who
take
superficial
views

that
this
view
of
life
will
enable
us
to
contemplate
the
imperfections
of
the
great
majority
of
men
their
moral
and
intellectual
deficiencies
and
the
resulting
base
type
of
countenance
without
any
surprise
to
say
nothing
of
indignation
for
we
shall
never
cease
to
reflect
where
we
are
and
that
the
men
about
us
are
beings
conceived
and
born
in
sin
and
living
to
atone
for
it
that
is
what
christianity
means
in
speaking
of
the
sinful
nature
of
man
the
word
to
whatever
folly
men
commit
be
their
shortcomings
or
their
vices
what
they
may
let
us
exercise
forbearance
remembering
that
when
these
faults
appear
in
others
it
is
our
follies
and
vices
that
we
behold
they
are
the
shortcomings
of
humanity
to
which
we
belong
whose
faults
one
and
all
we
share
yes
even
those
very
faults
at
which
we
now
wax
so
indignant
merely
because
they
have
not
yet
appeared
in
ourselves
they
are
faults
that
do
not
lie
on
the
surface
but
they
exist
down
there
in
the
depths
of
our
nature
and
should
anything
call
them
forth
they
will
come
and
show
themselves
just
as
we
now
see
them
in
others
one
man
it
is
true
may
have
faults
that
are
absent
in
his
fellow
and
it
is
undeniable
that
the
sum
total
of
bad
qualities
is
in
some
cases
very
large
for
the
difference
of
individuality
between
man
and
man

the

this
may
perhaps
sound
strange
but
it
is
in
keeping
with
the
facts
it
puts
others
in
a
right
light
and
it
reminds
us
of
that
which
is
after
all
the
most
necessary
thing
in
life
the
tolerance
patience
regard
and
love
of
neighbor
of
which
everyone
stands
in
need
and
which
therefore
every
man
owes
to
his
fellow
the
vanity
of
existence
this
vanity
finds
expression
in
the
whole
way
in
which
things
exist
in
the
infinite
nature
of
time
and
space
as
opposed
to
the
finite
nature
of
the
individual
in
both
in
the
present
moment
as
the
only
mode
of
actual
existence
in
the
interdependence
and
relativity
of
all
things
in
continual
becoming
without
ever
being
in
constant
wishing
and
never
being
satisfied
in
the
long
battle
which
forms
the
history
of
life
where
every
effort
is
checked
by
difficulties
and
stopped
until
they
are
overcome
time
is
that
in
which
all
things
pass
away
it
is
merely
the
form
under
which
the
will
to
live
the
and
therefore
imperishable
has
revealed
to
it
that
its
efforts
are
in
vain
it
is
that
agent
by
which
at
every
moment
all
things
in
our
hands
become
as
nothing
and
lose
any
real
value
they
possess
that
which
exists
no
more
it
exists
as
little
as
that
which
has
been
but
of
everything
that
exists
you
must
say
in
the
next
moment
that
it
has
been
hence
something
of
great
importance
now
past
is
inferior
to
something
of
little
importance
now
present
in
that
the
latter
is
a
and
related
to
the
former
as
something
to
nothing
a
man
finds
himself
to
his
great
astonishment
suddenly
existing
after
thousands
and
thousands
of
years
of
he
lives
for
a
little
while
and
then
again
comes
an
equally
long
period
when
he
must
exist
no
more
the
heart
rebels
against
this
and
feels
that
it
can
not
be
true
the
crudest
intellect
can
not
speculate
on
such
a
subject
without
having
a
presentiment
that
time
is
something
ideal
in
its
nature
this
ideality
of
time
and
space
is
the
key
to
every
true
system
of
metaphysics
because
it
provides
for
quite
another
order
of
things
than
is
to
be
met
with
in
the
domain
of
nature
this
is
why
kant
is
so
great
of
every
event
in
our
life
we
can
say
only
for
one
moment
that
it
for
ever
after
that
it
every
evening
we
are
poorer
by
a
day
it
might
perhaps
make
us
mad
to
see
how
rapidly
our
short
span
of
time
ebbs
away
if
it
were
not
that
in
the
furthest
depths
of
our
being
we
are
secretly
conscious
of
our
share
in
the
exhaustible
spring
of
eternity
so
that
we
can
always
hope
to
find
life
in
it
again
consideration
of
the
kind
touched
on
above
might
indeed
lead
us
to
embrace
the
belief
that
the
greatest
is
to
make
the
enjoyment
of
the
present
the
supreme
object
of
life
because
that
is
the
only
reality
all
else
being
merely
the
play
of
thought
on
the
other
hand
such
a
course
might
just
as
well
be
called
the
greatest
for
that
which
in
the
next
moment
exists
no
more
and
vanishes
utterly
like
a
dream
can
never
be
worth
a
serious
effort
the
whole
foundation
on
which
our
existence
rests
is
the
present
the
present
it
lies
then
in
the
very
nature
of
our
existence
to
take
the
form
of
constant
motion
and
to
offer
no
possibility
of
our
ever
attaining
the
rest
for
which
we
are
always
striving
we
are
like
a
man
running
downhill
who
can
not
keep
on
his
legs
unless
he
runs
on
and
will
inevitably
fall
if
he
stops
or
again
like
a
pole
balanced
on
the
tip
of
one
finger
or
like
a
planet
which
would
fall
into
its
sun
the
moment
it
ceased
to
hurry
forward
on
its
way
unrest
is
the
mark
of
existence
in
a
world
where
all
is
unstable
and
nought
can
endure
but
is
swept
onwards
at
once
in
the
hurrying
whirlpool
of
change
where
a
man
if
he
is
to
keep
erect
at
all
must
always
be
advancing
and
moving
like
an
acrobat
on
a
rope
in
such
a
world
happiness
in
inconceivable
how
can
it
dwell
where
as
plato
says
becoming
and
never
is
the
sole
form
of
existence
in
the
first
place
a
man
never
is
happy
but
spends
his
whole
life
in
striving
after
something
which
he
thinks
will
make
him
so
he
seldom
attains
his
goal
and
when
he
does
it
is
only
to
be
disappointed
he
is
mostly
shipwrecked
in
the
end
and
comes
into
harbor
with
masts
and
rigging
gone
and
then
it
is
all
one
whether
he
has
been
happy
or
miserable
for
his
life
was
never
anything
more
than
a
present
moment
always
vanishing
and
now
it
is
over
at
the
same
time
it
is
a
wonderful
thing
that
in
the
world
of
human
beings
as
in
that
of
animals
in
general
this
manifold
restless
motion
is
produced
and
kept
up
by
the
agency
of
two
simple
impulses
hunger
and
the
sexual
instinct
aided
a
little
perhaps
by
the
influence
of
boredom
but
by
nothing
else
and
that
in
the
theatre
of
life
these
suffice
to
form
the
of
how
complicated
a
machinery
setting
in
motion
how
strange
and
varied
a
scene
on
looking
a
little
closer
we
find
that
inorganic
matter
presents
a
constant
conflict
between
chemical
forces
which
eventually
works
dissolution
and
on
the
other
hand
that
organic
life
is
impossible
without
continual
change
of
matter
and
can
not
exist
if
it
does
not
receive
perpetual
help
from
without
this
is
the
realm
of
and
its
opposite
would
be
infinite
exposed
to
no
attack
from
without
and
needing
nothing
to
support

some
timeless
changeless
state
one
and
undiversified
the
negative
knowledge
of
which
forms
the
dominant
note
of
the
platonic
philosophy
it
is
to
some
such
state
as
this
that
the
denial
of
the
will
to
live
opens
up
the
way
the
scenes
of
our
life
are
like
pictures
done
in
rough
mosaic
looked
at
close
they
produce
no
effect
there
is
nothing
beautiful
to
be
found
in
them
unless
you
stand
some
distance
off
so
to
gain
anything
we
have
longed
for
is
only
to
discover
how
vain
and
empty
it
is
and
even
though
we
are
always
living
in
expectation
of
better
things
at
the
same
time
we
often
repent
and
long
to
have
the
past
back
again
we
look
upon
the
present
as
something
to
be
put
up
with
while
it
lasts
and
serving
only
as
the
way
towards
our
goal
hence
most
people
if
they
glance
back
when
they
come
to
the
end
of
life
will
find
that
all
along
they
have
been
living
they
will
be
surprised
to
find
that
the
very
thing
they
disregarded
and
let
slip
by
unenjoyed
was
just
the
life
in
the
expectation
of
which
they
passed
all
their
time
of
how
many
a
man
may
it
not
be
said
that
hope
made
a
fool
of
him
until
he
danced
into
the
arms
of
death
then
again
how
insatiable
a
creature
is
man
every
satisfaction
he
attains
lays
the
seeds
of
some
new
desire
so
that
there
is
no
end
to
the
wishes
of
each
individual
will
and
why
is
this
the
real
reason
is
simply
that
taken
in
itself
will
is
the
lord
of
all
worlds
everything
belongs
to
it
and
therefore
no
one
single
thing
can
ever
give
it
satisfaction
but
only
the
whole
which
is
endless
for
all
that
it
must
rouse
our
sympathy
to
think
how
very
little
the
will
this
lord
of
the
world
really
gets
when
it
takes
the
form
of
an
individual
usually
only
just
enough
to
keep
the
body
together
this
is
why
man
is
so
very
miserable
life
presents
itself
chiefly
as
a
task
the
task
i
mean
of
subsisting
at
all
sa
if
this
is
accomplished
life
is
a
burden
and
then
there
comes
the
second
task
of
doing
something
with
that
which
has
been
won
of
warding
off
boredom
which
like
a
bird
of
prey
hovers
over
us
ready
to
fall
wherever
it
sees
a
life
secure
from
need
the
first
task
is
to
win
something
the
second
to
banish
the
feeling
that
it
has
been
won
otherwise
it
is
a
burden
human
life
must
be
some
kind
of
mistake
the
truth
of
this
will
be
sufficiently
obvious
if
we
only
remember
that
man
is
a
compound
of
needs
and
necessities
hard
to
satisfy
and
that
even
when
they
are
satisfied
all
he
obtains
is
a
state
of
painlessness
where
nothing
remains
to
him
but
abandonment
to
boredom
this
is
direct
proof
that
existence
has
no
real
value
in
itself
for
what
is
boredom
but
the
feeling
of
the
emptiness
of
life
if
life
the
craving
for
which
is
the
very
essence
of
our
being
were
possessed
of
any
positive
intrinsic
value
there
would
be
no
such
thing
as
boredom
at
all
mere
existence
would
satisfy
us
in
itself
and
we
should
want
for
nothing
but
as
it
is
we
take
no
delight
in
existence
except
when
we
are
struggling
for
something
and
then
distance
and
difficulties
to
be
overcome
make
our
goal
look
as
though
it
would
satisfy
us
an
illusion
which
vanishes
when
we
reach
it
or
else
when
we
are
occupied
with
some
purely
intellectual
interest
when
in
reality
we
have
stepped
forth
from
life
to
look
upon
it
from
the
outside
much
after
the
manner
of
spectators
at
a
play
and
even
sensual
pleasure
itself
means
nothing
but
a
struggle
and
aspiration
ceasing
the
moment
its
aim
is
attained
whenever
we
are
not
occupied
in
one
of
these
ways
but
cast
upon
existence
itself
its
vain
and
worthless
nature
is
brought
home
to
us
and
this
is
what
we
mean
by
boredom
the
hankering
after
what
is
strange
and
uncommon
an
innate
and
ineradicable
tendency
of
human
nature
shows
how
glad
we
are
at
any
interruption
of
that
natural
course
of
affairs
which
is
so
very
tedious
that
this
most
perfect
manifestation
of
the
will
to
live
the
human
organism
with
the
cunning
and
complex
working
of
its
machinery
must
fall
to
dust
and
yield
up
itself
and
all
its
strivings
to
extinction
this
is
the
naïve
way
in
which
nature
who
is
always
so
true
and
sincere
in
what
she
says
proclaims
the
whole
struggle
of
this
will
as
in
its
very
essence
barren
and
unprofitable
were
it
of
any
value
in
itself
anything
unconditioned
and
absolute
it
could
not
thus
end
in
mere
nothing
if
we
turn
from
contemplating
the
world
as
a
whole
and
in
particular
the
generations
of
men
as
they
live
their
little
hour
of
and
then
are
swept
away
in
rapid
succession
if
we
turn
from
this
and
look
at
life
in
its
small
details
as
presented
say
in
a
comedy
how
ridiculous
it
all
seems
it
is
like
a
drop
of
water
seen
through
a
microscope
a
single
drop
teeming
with
or
a
speck
of
cheese
full
of
mites
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
how
we
laugh
as
they
bustle
about
so
eagerly
and
struggle
with
one
another
in
so
tiny
a
space
and
whether
here
or
in
the
little
span
of
human
life
this
terrible
activity
produces
a
comic
effect
it
is
only
in
the
microscope
that
our
life
looks
so
big
it
is
an
indivisible
point
drawn
out
and
magnified
by
the
powerful
lenses
of
time
and
space
on
suicide
as
far
as
i
know
none
but
the
votaries
of
monotheistic
that
is
to
say
jewish
religions
look
upon
suicide
as
a
crime
this
is
all
the
more
striking
inasmuch
as
neither
in
the
old
nor
in
the
new
testament
is
there
to
be
found
any
prohibition
or
positive
disapproval
of
it
so
that
religious
teachers
are
forced
to
base
their
condemnation
of
suicide
on
philosophical
grounds
of
their
own
invention
these
are
so
very
bad
that
writers
of
this
kind
endeavor
to
make
up
for
the
weakness
of
their
arguments
by
the
strong
terms
in
which
they
express
their
abhorrence
of
the
practice
in
other
words
they
declaim
against
it
they
tell
us
that
suicide
is
the
greatest
piece
of
cowardice
that
only
a
madman
could
be
guilty
of
it
and
other
insipidities
of
the
same
kind
or
else
they
make
the
nonsensical
remark
that
suicide
is
when
it
is
quite
obvious
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
to
which
every
man
has
a
more
unassailable
title
than
to
his
own
life
and
person
suicide
as
i
have
said
is
actually
accounted
a
crime
and
a
crime
which
especially
under
the
vulgar
bigotry
that
prevails
in
england
is
followed
by
an
ignominious
burial
and
the
seizure
of
the
property
and
for
that
reason
in
a
case
of
suicide
the
jury
almost
always
brings
in
a
verdict
of
insanity
now
let
the
reader
own
moral
feelings
decide
as
to
whether
or
not
suicide
is
a
criminal
act
think
of
the
impression
that
would
be
made
upon
you
by
the
news
that
some
one
you
know
had
committed
the
crime
say
of
murder
or
theft
or
been
guilty
of
some
act
of
cruelty
or
deception
and
compare
it
with
your
feelings
when
you
hear
that
he
has
met
a
voluntary
death
while
in
the
one
case
a
lively
sense
of
indignation
and
extreme
resentment
will
be
aroused
and
you
will
call
loudly
for
punishment
or
revenge
in
the
other
you
will
be
moved
to
grief
and
sympathy
and
mingled
with
your
thoughts
will
be
admiration
for
his
courage
rather
than
the
moral
disapproval
which
follows
upon
a
wicked
action
who
has
not
had
acquaintances
friends
relations
who
of
their
own
free
will
have
left
this
world
and
are
these
to
be
thought
of
with
horror
as
criminals
most
emphatically
no
i
am
rather
of
opinion
that
the
clergy
should
be
challenged
to
explain
what
right
they
have
to
go
into
the
pulpit
or
take
up
their
pens
and
stamp
as
a
crime
an
action
which
many
men
whom
we
hold
in
affection
and
honor
have
committed
and
to
refuse
an
honorable
burial
to
those
who
relinquish
this
world
voluntarily
they
have
no
biblical
authority
to
boast
of
as
justifying
their
condemnation
of
suicide
nay
not
even
any
philosophical
arguments
that
will
hold
water
and
it
must
be
understood
that
it
is
arguments
we
want
and
that
we
will
not
be
put
off
with
mere
phrases
or
words
of
abuse
if
the
criminal
law
forbids
suicide
that
is
not
an
argument
valid
in
the
church
and
besides
the
prohibition
is
ridiculous
for
what
penalty
can
frighten
a
man
who
is
not
afraid
of
death
itself
if
the
law
punishes
people
for
trying
to
commit
suicide
it
is
punishing
the
want
of
skill
that
makes
the
attempt
a
failure
the
ancients
moreover
were
very
far
from
regarding
the
matter
in
that
light
pliny
says
is
not
so
desirable
a
thing
as
to
be
protracted
at
any
cost
whoever
you
are
you
are
sure
to
die
even
though
your
life
has
been
full
of
abomination
and
crime
the
chief
of
all
remedies
for
a
troubled
mind
is
the
feeling
that
among
the
blessings
which
nature
gives
to
man
there
is
none
greater
than
an
opportune
death
and
the
best
of
it
is
that
every
one
can
avail
himself
of
it
and
elsewhere
the
same
writer
declares
even
to
god
are
all
things
possible
for
he
could
not
compass
his
own
death
if
he
willed
to
die
and
yet
in
all
the
miseries
of
our
earthly
life
this
is
the
best
of
his
gifts
to
man
nay
in
massilia
and
on
the
isle
of
ceos
the
man
who
could
give
valid
reasons
for
relinquishing
his
life
was
handed
the
cup
of
hemlock
by
the
magistrate
and
that
too
in
public
and
in
ancient
times
how
many
heroes
and
wise
men
died
a
voluntary
death
aristotle
it
is
true
declared
suicide
to
be
an
offence
against
the
state
although
not
against
the
person
but
in
stobaeus
exposition
of
the
peripatetic
philosophy
there
is
the
following
remark
good
man
should
flee
life
when
his
misfortunes
become
too
great
the
bad
man
also
when
he
is
too
and
similarly
he
will
marry
and
beget
children
and
take
part
in
the
affairs
of
the
state
and
generally
practice
virtue
and
continue
to
live
and
then
again
if
need
be
and
at
any
time
necessity
compels
him
he
will
depart
to
his
place
of
refuge
in
the
tomb
and
we
find
that
the
stoics
actually
praised
suicide
as
a
noble
and
heroic
action
as
hundreds
of
passages
show
above
all
in
the
works
of
seneca
who
expresses
the
strongest
approval
of
it
as
is
well
known
the
hindoos
look
upon
suicide
as
a
religious
act
especially
when
it
takes
the
form
of
by
widows
but
also
when
it
consists
in
casting
oneself
under
the
wheels
of
the
chariot
of
the
god
at
juggernaut
or
being
eaten
by
crocodiles
in
the
ganges
or
being
drowned
in
the
holy
tanks
in
the
temples
and
so
on
the
same
thing
occurs
on
the
stage
that
mirror
of
life
for
example
in
de
la
a
celebrated
chinese
play
almost
all
the
noble
characters
end
by
suicide
without
the
slightest
hint
anywhere
or
any
impression
being
produced
on
the
spectator
that
they
are
committing
a
crime
and
in
our
own
theatre
it
is
much
the
same
palmira

instance
in
or
mortimer
in
othello
countess
terzky

hamlet

the
meditation
of
a
criminal
he
merely
declares
that
if
we
had
any
certainty
of
being
annihilated
by
it
death
would
be
infinitely
preferable
to
the
world

it

and
the
of
the
by
the
late
david
hume
basle
sold
by
james
decker
in
my
chief
work
i
have
explained
the
only
valid
reason
existing
against
suicide
on
the
score
of
mortality
it
is
this
that
suicide
thwarts
the
attainment
of
the
highest
moral
aim
by
the
fact
that
for
a
real
release
from
this
world
of
misery
it
substitutes
one
that
is
merely
apparent
but
from
a
to
a
is
a
far
cry
and
it
is
as
a
crime
that
the
clergy
of
christendom
wish
us
to
regard
suicide
the
inmost
kernel
of
christianity
is
the
truth
that
suffering
is
the
real
end
and
object
of
life
hence
christianity
condemns
suicide
as
thwarting
this
end
whilst
the
ancient
world
taking
a
lower
point
of
view
held
it
in
approval
nay
in
honor
but
if
that
is
to
be
accounted
a
valid
reason
against
suicide
it
involves
the
recognition
of
asceticism
that
is
to
say
it
is
valid
only
from
a
much
higher
ethical
standpoint
than
has
ever
been
adopted
by
moral
philosophers
in
europe
if
we
abandon
that
high
standpoint
there
is
no
tenable
reason
left
on
the
score
of
morality
for
condemning
suicide
the
extraordinary
energy
and
zeal
with
which
the
clergy
of
monotheistic
religions
attack
suicide
is
not
supported
either
by
any
passages
in
the
bible
or
by
any
considerations
of
weight
so
that
it
looks
as
though
they
must
have
some
secret
reason
for
their
contention
may
it
not
be
this
that
the
voluntary
surrender
of
life
is
a
bad
compliment
for
him
who
said
that
things
were
very
if
this
is
so
it
offers
another
instance
of
the
crass
optimism
of
these
religions
denouncing
suicide
to
escape
being
denounced
by
it
footnote
schopenhauer
refers
to
welt
als
wille
und
vol
where
the
reader
may
find
the
same
argument
stated
at
somewhat
greater
length
according
to
schopenhauer
moral
freedom
the
highest
ethical
aim
is
to
be
obtained
only
by
a
denial
of
the
will
to
live
far
from
being
a
denial
suicide
is
an
emphatic
assertion
of
this
will
for
it
is
in
fleeing
from
the
pleasures
not
from
the
sufferings
of
life
that
this
denial
consists
when
a
man
destroys
his
existence
as
an
individual
he
is
not
by
any
means
destroying
his
will
to
live
on
the
contrary
he
would
like
to
live
if
he
could
do
so
with
satisfaction
to
himself
if
he
could
assert
his
will
against
the
power
of
circumstance
but
circumstance
is
too
strong
for
him
it
will
generally
be
found
that
as
soon
as
the
terrors
of
life
reach
the
point
at
which
they
outweigh
the
terrors
of
death
a
man
will
put
an
end
to
his
life
but
the
terrors
of
death
offer
considerable
resistance
they
stand
like
a
sentinel
at
the
gate
leading
out
of
this
world
perhaps
there
is
no
man
alive
who
would
not
have
already
put
an
end
to
his
life
if
this
end
had
been
of
a
purely
negative
character
a
sudden
stoppage
of
existence
there
is
something
positive
about
it
it
is
the
destruction
of
the
body
and
a
man
shrinks
from
that
because
his
body
is
the
manifestation
of
the
will
to
live
however
the
struggle
with
that
sentinel
is
as
a
rule
not
so
hard
as
it
may
seem
from
a
long
way
off
mainly
in
consequence
of
the
antagonism
between
the
ills
of
the
body
and
the
ills
of
the
mind
if
we
are
in
great
bodily
pain
or
the
pain
lasts
a
long
time
we
become
indifferent
to
other
troubles
all
we
think
about
is
to
get
well
in
the
same
way
great
mental
suffering
makes
us
insensible
to
bodily
pain
we
despise
it
nay
if
it
should
outweigh
the
other
it
distracts
our
thoughts
and
we
welcome
it
as
a
pause
in
mental
suffering
it
is
this
feeling
that
makes
suicide
easy
for
the
bodily
pain
that
accompanies
it
loses
all
significance
in
the
eyes
of
one
who
is
tortured
by
an
excess
of
mental
suffering
this
is
especially
evident
in
the
case
of
those
who
are
driven
to
suicide
by
some
purely
morbid
and
exaggerated
no
special
effort
to
overcome
their
feelings
is
necessary
nor
do
such
people
require
to
be
worked
up
in
order
to
take
the
step
but
as
soon
as
the
keeper
into
whose
charge
they
are
given
leaves
them
for
a
couple
of
minutes
they
quickly
bring
their
life
to
an
end
when
in
some
dreadful
and
ghastly
dream
we
reach
the
moment
of
greatest
horror
it
awakes
us
thereby
banishing
all
the
hideous
shapes
that
were
born
of
the
night
and
life
is
a
dream
when
the
moment
of
greatest
horror
compels
us
to
break
it
off
the
same
thing
happens
suicide
may
also
be
regarded
as
an
experiment
a
question
which
man
puts
to
nature
trying
to
force
her
to
an
answer
the
question
is
this
what
change
will
death
produce
in
a
man
existence
and
in
his
insight
into
the
nature
of
things
it
is
a
clumsy
experiment
to
make
for
it
involves
the
destruction
of
the
very
consciousness
which
puts
the
question
and
awaits
the
answer
immortality
a
dialogue
footnote
the
word
immortality
does
not
occur
in
the
original
nor
would
it
in
its
usual
application
find
a
place
in
vocabulary
the
word
he
uses
is
but
i
have
preferred
because
that
word
is
commonly
associated
with
the
subject
touched
upon
in
this
little
debate
if
any
critic
doubts
the
wisdom
of
this
preference
let
me
ask
him
to
try
his
hand
at
a
short
concise
and
at
the
same
time
popularly
intelligible
rendering
of
the
german
original
which
runs
thus

tell
me
now
in
one
word
what
shall
i
be
after
my
death
and
mind
you
be
clear
and
precise
all
and
nothing
i
thought
so
i
gave
you
a
problem
and
you
solve
it
by
a
contradiction
that
a
very
stale
trick
yes
but
you
raise
transcendental
questions
and
you
expect
me
to
answer
them
in
language
that
is
only
made
for
immanent
knowledge
it
no
wonder
that
a
contradiction
ensues
what
do
you
mean
by
transcendental
questions
and
immanent
knowledge
i
heard
these
expressions
before
of
course
they
are
not
new
to
me
the
professor
was
fond
of
using
them
but
only
as
predicates
of
the
deity
and
he
never
talked
of
anything
else
which
was
all
quite
right
and
proper
he
argued
thus
if
the
deity
was
in
the
world
itself
he
was
immanent
if
he
was
somewhere
outside
it
he
was
transcendent
nothing
could
be
clearer
and
more
obvious
you
knew
where
you
were
but
this
kantian
rigmarole
wo
do
any
more
it
antiquated
and
no
longer
applicable
to
modern
ideas
why
had
a
whole
row
of
eminent
men
in
the
metropolis
of
german
learning
aside
german
humbug
he
means
the
mighty
schleiermacher
for
instance
and
that
gigantic
intellect
hegel
and
at
this
time
of
day
we
abandoned
that
nonsense
i
should
rather
say
we
so
far
beyond
it
that
we
ca
put
up
with
it
any
more
what
the
use
of
it
then
what
does
it
all
mean
transcendental
knowledge
is
knowledge
which
passes
beyond
the
bounds
of
possible
experience
and
strives
to
determine
the
nature
of
things
as
they
are
in
themselves
immanent
knowledge
on
the
other
hand
is
knowledge
which
confines
itself
entirely
with
those
bounds
so
that
it
can
not
apply
to
anything
but
actual
phenomena
as
far
as
you
are
an
individual
death
will
be
the
end
of
you
but
your
individuality
is
not
your
true
and
inmost
being
it
is
only
the
outward
manifestation
of
it
it
is
not
the
but
only
the
phenomenon
presented
in
the
form
of
time
and
therefore
with
a
beginning
and
an
end
but
your
real
being
knows
neither
time
nor
beginning
nor
end
nor
yet
the
limits
of
any
given
individual
it
is
everywhere
present
in
every
individual
and
no
individual
can
exist
apart
from
it
so
when
death
comes
on
the
one
hand
you
are
annihilated
as
an
individual
on
the
other
you
are
and
remain
everything
that
is
what
i
meant
when
i
said
that
after
your
death
you
would
be
all
and
nothing
it
is
difficult
to
find
a
more
precise
answer
to
your
question
and
at
the
same
time
be
brief
the
answer
is
contradictory
i
admit
but
it
is
so
simply
because
your
life
is
in
time
and
the
immortal
part
of
you
in
eternity
you
may
put
the
matter
thus
your
immortal
part
is
something
that
does
not
last
in
time
and
yet
is
indestructible
but
there
you
have
another
contradiction
you
see
what
happens
by
trying
to
bring
the
transcendental
within
the
limits
of
immanent
knowledge
it
is
in
some
sort
doing
violence
to
the
latter
by
misusing
it
for
ends
it
was
never
meant
to
serve
look
here
i
sha
give
twopence
for
your
immortality
unless
i
to
remain
an
individual
well
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
satisfy
you
on
this
point
suppose
i
guarantee
that
after
death
you
shall
remain
an
individual
but
only
on
condition
that
you
first
spend
three
months
of
complete
unconsciousness
i
shall
have
no
objection
to
that
but
remember
if
people
are
completely
unconscious
they
take
no
account
of
time
so
when
you
are
dead
it
all
the
same
to
you
whether
three
months
pass
in
the
world
of
consciousness
or
ten
thousand
years
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
believing
what
is
told
you
when
you
awake
so
far
then
you
can
afford
to
be
indifferent
whether
it
is
three
months
or
ten
thousand
years
that
pass
before
you
recover
your
individuality
yes
if
it
comes
to
that
i
suppose
you
right
and
if
by
chance
after
those
ten
thousand
years
have
gone
by
no
one
ever
thinks
of
awakening
you
i
fancy
it
would
be
no
great
misfortune
you
would
have
become
quite
accustomed
to
after
so
long
a
spell
of
it
following
upon
such
a
very
few
years
of
life
at
any
rate
you
may
be
sure
you
would
be
perfectly
ignorant
of
the
whole
thing
further
if
you
knew
that
the
mysterious
power
which
keeps
you
in
your
present
state
of
life
had
never
once
ceased
in
those
ten
thousand
years
to
bring
forth
other
phenomena
like
yourself
and
to
endow
them
with
life
it
would
fully
console
you
indeed
so
you
think
you
quietly
going
to
do
me
out
of
my
individuality
with
all
this
fine
talk
but
i
up
to
your
tricks
i
tell
you
i
wo
exist
unless
i
can
have
my
individuality
i
not
going
to
be
put
off
with
powers
and
what
you
call
i
ca
do
without
my
individuality
and
i
give
it
up
you
mean
i
suppose
that
your
individuality
is
such
a
delightful
thing
so
splendid
so
perfect
and
beyond
compare
that
you
ca
imagine
anything
better
are
you
ready
to
exchange
your
present
state
for
one
which
if
we
can
judge
by
what
is
told
us
may
possibly
be
superior
and
more
endurable
do
you
see
that
my
individuality
be
it
what
it
may
is
my
very
self
to
me
it
is
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
god
is
god
and
i
am
want
to
exist
that
the
main
thing
i
do
care
about
an
existence
which
has
to
be
proved
to
be
mine
before
i
can
believe
it
think
what
you
doing
when
you
say
i
want
to
exist
it
is
not
you
alone
that
says
this
everything
says
it
absolutely
everything
that
has
the
faintest
trace
of
consciousness
it
follows
then
that
this
desire
of
yours
is
just
the
part
of
you
that
is
the
part
that
is
common
to
all
things
without
distinction
it
is
the
cry
not
of
the
individual
but
of
existence
itself
it
is
the
intrinsic
element
in
everything
that
exists
nay
it
is
the
cause
of
anything
existing
at
all
this
desire
craves
for
and
so
is
satisfied
with
nothing
less
than
existence
in
general
not
any
definite
individual
existence
no
that
is
not
its
aim
it
seems
to
be
so
only
because
this
desire
this
attains
consciousness
only
in
the
individual
and
therefore
looks
as
though
it
were
concerned
with
nothing
but
the
individual
there
lies
the
illusion
an
illusion
it
is
true
in
which
the
individual
is
held
fast
but
if
he
reflects
he
can
break
the
fetters
and
set
himself
free
it
is
only
indirectly
i
say
that
the
individual
has
this
violent
craving
for
existence
it
is
will
to
which
is
the
real
and
direct
aspirant
alike
and
identical
in
all
things
since
then
existence
is
the
free
work
nay
the
mere
reflection
of
the
will
where
existence
is
there
too
must
be
will
and
for
the
moment
the
will
finds
its
satisfaction
in
existence
itself
so
far
i
mean
as
that
which
never
rests
but
presses
forward
eternally
can
ever
find
any
satisfaction
at
all
the
will
is
careless
of
the
individual
the
individual
is
not
its
business
although
as
i
have
said
this
seems
to
be
the
case
because
the
individual
has
no
direct
consciousness
of
will
except
in
himself
the
effect
of
this
is
to
make
the
individual
careful
to
maintain
his
own
existence
and
if
this
were
not
so
there
would
be
no
surety
for
the
preservation
of
the
species
from
all
this
it
is
clear
that
individuality
is
not
a
form
of
perfection
but
rather
of
limitation
and
so
to
be
freed
from
it
is
not
loss
but
gain
trouble
yourself
no
more
about
the
matter
once
thoroughly
recognize
what
you
are
what
your
existence
really
is
namely
the
universal
will
to
live
and
the
whole
question
will
seem
to
you
childish
and
most
ridiculous
you
childish
yourself
and
most
ridiculous
like
all
philosophers
and
if
a
man
of
my
age
lets
himself
in
for
a
talk
with
such
fools
it
is
only
because
it
amuses
me
and
passes
the
time
i
more
important
business
to
attend
to
so
further
psychological
observations
there
is
an
unconscious
propriety
in
the
way
in
which
in
all
european
languages
the
word
is
commonly
used
to
denote
a
human
being
the
real
meaning
of
is
such
as
actors
were
accustomed
to
wear
on
the
ancient
stage
and
it
is
quite
true
that
no
one
shows
himself
as
he
is
but
wears
his
mask
and
plays
his
part
indeed
the
whole
of
our
social
arrangements
may
be
likened
to
a
perpetual
comedy
and
this
is
why
a
man
who
is
worth
anything
finds
society
so
insipid
while
a
blockhead
is
quite
at
home
in
it
reason
deserves
to
be
called
a
prophet
for
in
showing
us
the
consequence
and
effect
of
our
actions
in
the
present
does
it
not
tell
us
what
the
future
will
be
this
is
precisely
why
reason
is
such
an
excellent
power
of
restraint
in
moments
when
we
are
possessed
by
some
base
passion
some
fit
of
anger
some
covetous
desire
that
will
lead
us
to
do
things
whereof
we
must
presently
repent
comes
from
the
heart
from
the
head
and
neither
feeling
is
quite
within
our
control
for
we
can
not
alter
our
heart
its
basis
is
determined
by
motives
and
our
head
deals
with
objective
facts
and
applies
to
them
rules
which
are
immutable
any
given
individual
is
the
union
of
a
particular
heart
with
a
particular
head
hatred
and
contempt
are
diametrically
opposed
and
mutually
exclusive
there
are
even
not
a
few
cases
where
hatred
of
a
person
is
rooted
in
nothing
but
forced
esteem
for
his
qualities
and
besides
if
a
man
sets
out
to
hate
all
the
miserable
creatures
he
meets
he
will
not
have
much
energy
left
for
anything
else
whereas
he
can
despise
them
one
and
all
with
the
greatest
ease
true
genuine
contempt
is
just
the
reverse
of
true
genuine
pride
it
keeps
quite
quiet
and
gives
no
sign
of
its
existence
for
if
a
man
shows
that
he
despises
you
he
signifies
at
least
this
much
regard
for
you
that
he
wants
to
let
you
know
how
little
he
appreciates
you
and
his
wish
is
dictated
by
hatred
which
can
not
exist
with
real
contempt
on
the
contrary
if
it
is
genuine
it
is
simply
the
conviction
that
the
object
of
it
is
a
man
of
no
value
at
all
contempt
is
not
incompatible
with
indulgent
and
kindly
treatment
and
for
the
sake
of
one
own
peace
and
safety
this
should
not
be
omitted
it
will
prevent
irritation
and
there
is
no
one
who
can
not
do
harm
if
he
is
roused
to
it
but
if
this
pure
cold
sincere
contempt
ever
shows
itself
it
will
be
met
with
the
most
truculent
hatred
for
the
despised
person
is
not
in
a
position
to
fight
contempt
with
its
own
weapons
melancholy
is
a
very
different
thing
from
bad
humor
and
of
the
two
it
is
not
nearly
so
far
removed
from
a
gay
and
happy
temperament
melancholy
attracts
while
bad
humor
repels
hypochondria
is
a
species
of
torment
which
not
only
makes
us
unreasonably
cross
with
the
things
of
the
present
not
only
fills
us
with
groundless
anxiety
on
the
score
of
future
misfortunes
entirely
of
our
own
manufacture
but
also
leads
to
unmerited
for
what
we
have
done
in
the
past
hypochondria
shows
itself
in
a
perpetual
hunting
after
things
that
vex
and
annoy
and
then
brooding
over
them
the
cause
of
it
is
an
inward
morbid
discontent
often
with
a
naturally
restless
temperament
in
their
extreme
form
this
discontent
and
this
unrest
lead
to
suicide
any
incident
however
trivial
that
rouses
disagreeable
emotion
leaves
an
in
our
mind
which
for
the
time
it
lasts
prevents
our
taking
a
clear
objective
view
of
the
things
about
us
and
tinges
all
our
thoughts
just
as
a
small
object
held
close
to
the
eye
limits
and
distorts
our
field
of
vision
what
makes
people
is
this
that
each
man
has
or
fancies
he
has
as
much
as
he
can
bear
in
his
own
troubles
hence
if
a
man
suddenly
finds
himself
in
an
unusually
happy
position
it
will
in
most
cases
result
in
his
being
sympathetic
and
kind
but
if
he
has
never
been
in
any
other
than
a
happy
position
or
this
becomes
his
permanent
state
the
effect
of
it
is
often
just
the
contrary
it
so
far
removes
him
from
suffering
that
he
is
incapable
of
feeling
any
more
sympathy
with
it
so
it
is
that
the
poor
often
show
themselves
more
ready
to
help
than
the
rich
at
times
it
seems
as
though
we
both
wanted
and
did
not
want
the
same
thing
and
felt
at
once
glad
and
sorry
about
it
for
instance
if
on
some
fixed
date
we
are
going
to
be
put
to
a
decisive
test
about
anything
in
which
it
would
be
a
great
advantage
to
us
to
come
off
victorious
we
shall
be
anxious
for
it
to
take
place
at
once
and
at
the
same
time
we
shall
tremble
at
the
thought
of
its
approach
and
if
in
the
meantime
we
hear
that
for
once
in
a
way
the
date
has
been
postponed
we
shall
experience
a
feeling
both
of
pleasure
and
of
annoyance
for
the
news
is
disappointing
but
nevertheless
it
affords
us
momentary
relief
it
is
just
the
same
thing
if
we
are
expecting
some
important
letter
carrying
a
definite
decision
and
it
fails
to
arrive
in
such
cases
there
are
really
two
different
motives
at
work
in
us
the
stronger
but
more
distant
of
the
two
being
the
desire
to
stand
the
test
and
to
have
the
decision
given
in
our
favor
and
the
weaker
which
touches
us
more
nearly
the
wish
to
be
left
for
the
present
in
peace
and
quiet
and
accordingly
in
further
enjoyment
of
the
advantage
which
at
any
rate
attaches
to
a
state
of
hopeful
uncertainty
compared
with
the
possibility
that
the
issue
may
be
unfavorable
in
my
head
there
is
a
permanent
and
whenever
i
take
any
step
or
come
to
any
decision
though
i
may
have
given
the
matter
mature
consideration
it
afterwards
attacks
what
i
have
done
without
however
being
each
time
necessarily
in
the
right
this
is
i
suppose
only
a
form
of
rectification
on
the
part
of
the
spirit
of
scrutiny
but
it
often
reproaches
me
when
i
do
not
deserve
it
the
same
thing
no
doubt
happens
to
many
others
as
well
for
where
is
the
man
who
can
help
thinking
that
after
all
it
were
better
not
to
have
done
something
that
he
did
with
great
deliberation
tam
dextro
pede
concipis
ut
te
conatus
non
poeniteat
votique
why
is
it
that
is
an
expression
of
contempt
and
that
extraordinary
denote
approbation
why
is
everything
that
is
common
contemptible
in
its
original
meaning
denotes
that
which
is
peculiar
to
all
men
shared
equally
by
the
whole
species
and
therefore
an
inherent
part
of
its
nature
accordingly
if
an
individual
possesses
no
qualities
beyond
those
which
attach
to
mankind
in
general
he
is
a
man
is
a
much
milder
word
and
refers
rather
to
intellectual
character
whereas
has
more
of
a
moral
application
what
value
can
a
creature
have
that
is
not
a
whit
different
from
millions
of
its
kind
millions
do
i
say
nay
an
infiniture
of
creatures
which
century
after
century
in
flow
nature
sends
bubbling
up
from
her
inexhaustible
springs
as
generous
with
them
as
the
smith
with
the
useless
sparks
that
fly
around
his
anvil
it
is
obviously
quite
right
that
a
creature
which
has
no
qualities
except
those
of
the
species
should
have
to
confine
its
claim
to
an
existence
entirely
within
the
limits
of
the
species
and
live
a
life
conditioned
by
those
limits
in
various
passages
of
my
works
i
have
argued
that
whilst
a
lower
animal
possesses
nothing
more
than
the
generic
character
of
its
species
man
is
the
only
being
which
can
lay
claim
to
possess
an
individual
character
but
in
most
men
this
individual
character
comes
to
very
little
in
reality
and
they
may
be
almost
all
ranged
under
certain
classes
sont
des
their
thoughts
and
desires
like
their
faces
are
those
of
the
species
or
at
any
rate
those
of
the
class
to
which
they
belong
and
accordingly
they
are
of
a
trivial
common
character
and
exist
by
the
thousand
you
can
usually
tell
beforehand
what
they
are
likely
to
do
and
say
they
have
no
special
stamp
or
mark
to
distinguish
them
they
are
like
manufactured
goods
all
of
a
piece
footnote
der
als
wille
und
vol
p
if
then
their
nature
is
merged
in
that
of
the
species
how
shall
their
existence
go
beyond
it
the
curse
of
vulgarity
puts
men
on
a
par
with
the
lower
animals
by
allowing
them
none
but
a
generic
nature
a
generic
form
of
existence
anything
that
is
high
or
great
or
noble
must
then
as
a
mater
of
course
and
by
its
very
nature
stand
alone
in
a
world
where
no
better
expression
can
be
found
to
denote
what
is
base
and
contemptible
than
that
which
i
have
mentioned
as
in
general
use
namely
will
as
the
is
the
foundation
of
all
being
it
is
part
and
parcel
of
every
creature
and
the
permanent
element
in
everything
will
then
is
that
which
we
possess
in
common
with
all
men
nay
with
all
animals
and
even
with
lower
forms
of
existence
and
in
so
far
we
are
akin
to
everything
so
far
that
is
as
everything
is
filled
to
overflowing
with
will
on
the
other
hand
that
which
places
one
being
over
another
and
sets
differences
between
man
and
man
is
intellect
and
knowledge
therefore
in
every
manifestation
of
self
we
should
as
far
as
possible
give
play
to
the
intellect
alone
for
as
we
have
seen
the
will
is
the
part
of
us
every
violent
exhibition
of
will
is
common
and
vulgar
in
other
words
it
reduces
us
to
the
level
of
the
species
and
makes
us
a
mere
type
and
example
of
it
in
that
it
is
just
the
character
of
the
species
that
we
are
showing
so
every
fit
of
anger
is
something
every
unrestrained
display
of
joy
or
of
hate
or
fear
in
short
every
form
of
emotion
in
other
words
every
movement
of
the
will
if
it
so
strong
as
decidedly
to
outweigh
the
intellectual
element
in
consciousness
and
to
make
the
man
appear
as
a
being
that
rather
than
in
giving
way
to
emotion
of
this
violent
kind
the
greatest
genius
puts
himself
on
a
level
with
the
commonest
son
of
earth
contrarily
if
a
man
desires
to
be
absolutely
uncommon
in
other
words
great
he
should
never
allow
his
consciousness
to
be
taken
possession
of
and
dominated
by
the
movement
of
his
will
however
much
he
may
be
solicited
thereto
for
example
he
must
be
able
to
observe
that
other
people
are
badly
disposed
towards
him
without
feeling
any
hatred
towards
them
himself
nay
there
is
no
surer
sign
of
a
great
mind
than
that
it
refuses
to
notice
annoying
and
insulting
expressions
but
straightway
ascribes
them
as
it
ascribes
countless
other
mistakes
to
the
defective
knowledge
of
the
speaker
and
so
merely
observes
without
feeling
them
this
is
the
meaning
of
that
remark
of
gracian
that
nothing
is
more
unworthy
of
a
man
than
to
let
it
be
seen
that
he
is
one
mayor
desdoro

un

dar
muestras
de
que
es
and
even
in
the
drama
which
is
the
peculiar
province
of
the
passions
and
emotions
it
is
easy
for
them
to
appear
common
and
vulgar
and
this
is
specially
observable
in
the
works
of
the
french
tragic
writers
who
set
no
other
aim
before
themselves
but
the
delineation
of
the
passions
and
by
indulging
at
one
moment
in
a
vaporous
kind
of
pathos
which
makes
them
ridiculous
at
another
in
epigrammatic
witticisms
endeavor
to
conceal
the
vulgarity
of
their
subject
i
remember
seeing
the
celebrated
mademoiselle
rachel
as
maria
stuart
and
when
she
burst
out
in
fury
against
elizabeth
though
she
did
it
very
well
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
a
washerwoman
she
played
the
final
parting
in
such
a
way
as
to
deprive
it
of
all
true
tragic
feeling
of
which
indeed
the
french
have
no
notion
at
all
the
same
part
was
incomparably
better
played
by
the
italian
ristori
and
in
fact
the
italian
nature
though
in
many
respects
very
different
from
the
german
shares
its
appreciation
for
what
is
deep
serious
and
true
in
art
herein
opposed
to
the
french
which
everywhere
betrays
that
it
possesses
none
of
this
feeling
whatever
the
noble
in
other
words
the
uncommon
element
in
the
drama
nay
what
is
sublime
in
it
is
not
reached
until
the
intellect
is
set
to
work
as
opposed
to
the
will
until
it
takes
a
free
flight
over
all
those
passionate
movements
of
the
will
and
makes
them
subject
of
its
contemplation
shakespeare
in
particular
shows
that
this
is
his
general
method
more
especially
in
hamlet
and
only
when
intellect
rises
to
the
point
where
the
vanity
of
all
effort
is
manifest
and
the
will
proceeds
to
an
act
of
is
the
drama
tragic
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
it
is
then
that
it
reaches
its
highest
aim
in
becoming
really
sublime
every
man
takes
the
limits
of
his
own
field
of
vision
for
the
limits
of
the
world
this
is
an
error
of
the
intellect
as
inevitable
as
that
error
of
the
eye
which
lets
us
fancy
that
on
the
horizon
heaven
and
earth
meet
this
explains
many
things
and
among
them
the
fact
that
everyone
measures
us
with
his
own
standard
generally
about
as
long
as
a
tailor
tape
and
we
have
to
put
up
with
it
as
also
that
no
one
will
allow
us
to
be
taller
than
himself
a
supposition
which
is
once
for
all
taken
for
granted
there
is
no
doubt
that
many
a
man
owes
his
good
fortune
in
life
solely
to
the
circumstance
that
he
has
a
pleasant
way
of
smiling
and
so
wins
the
heart
in
his
favor
however
the
heart
would
do
better
to
be
careful
and
to
remember
what
hamlet
put
down
in
his
tablets
one
may
smile
and
smile
and
be
a
everything
that
is
really
fundamental
in
a
man
and
therefore
genuine
works
as
such
unconsciously
in
this
respect
like
the
power
of
nature
that
which
has
passed
through
the
domain
of
consciousness
is
thereby
transformed
into
an
idea
or
picture
and
so
if
it
comes
to
be
uttered
it
is
only
an
idea
or
picture
which
passes
from
one
person
to
another
accordingly
any
quality
of
mind
or
character
that
is
genuine
and
lasting
is
originally
unconscious
and
it
is
only
when
unconsciously
brought
into
play
that
it
makes
a
profound
impression
if
any
like
quality
is
consciously
exercised
it
means
that
it
has
been
worked
up
it
becomes
intentional
and
therefore
matter
of
affectation
in
other
words
of
deception
if
a
man
does
a
thing
unconsciously
it
costs
him
no
trouble
but
if
he
tries
to
do
it
by
taking
trouble
he
fails
this
applies
to
the
origin
of
those
fundamental
ideas
which
form
the
pith
and
marrow
of
all
genuine
work
only
that
which
is
innate
is
genuine
and
will
hold
water
and
every
man
who
wants
to
achieve
something
whether
in
practical
life
in
literature
or
in
art
must
the
rules
without
knowing
men
of
very
great
capacity
will
as
a
rule
find
the
company
of
very
stupid
people
preferable
to
that
of
the
common
run
for
the
same
reason
that
the
tyrant
and
the
mob
the
grandfather
and
the
grandchildren
are
natural
allies
that
line
of
ovid
cum
spectent
animalia
cetera
can
be
applied
in
its
true
physical
sense
to
the
lower
animals
alone
but
in
a
metaphorical
and
spiritual
sense
it
is
alas
true
of
nearly
all
men
as
well
all
their
plans
and
projects
are
merged
in
the
desire
of
physical
enjoyment
physical
they
may
indeed
have
personal
interests
often
embracing
a
very
varied
sphere
but
still
these
latter
receive
their
importance
entirely
from
the
relation
in
which
they
stand
to
the
former
this
is
not
only
proved
by
their
manner
of
life
and
the
things
they
say
but
it
even
shows
itself
in
the
way
they
look
the
expression
of
their
physiognomy
their
gait
and
gesticulations
everything
about
them
cries
out

it
is
not
to
them
it
is
only
to
the
nobler
and
more
highly
endowed
natures
men
who
really
think
and
look
about
them
in
the
world
and
form
exceptional
specimens
of
humanity

no
one
knows
what
capacities
for
doing
and
suffering
he
has
in
himself
until
something
comes
to
rouse
them
to
activity
just
as
in
a
pond
of
still
water
lying
there
like
a
mirror
there
is
no
sign
of
the
roar
and
thunder
with
which
it
can
leap
from
the
precipice
and
yet
remain
what
it
is
or
again
rise
high
in
the
air
as
a
fountain
when
water
is
as
cold
as
ice
you
can
have
no
idea
of
the
latent
warmth
contained
in
it
why
is
it
that
in
spite
of
all
the
mirrors
in
the
world
no
one
really
knows
what
he
looks
like
a
man
may
call
to
mind
the
face
of
his
friend
but
not
his
own
here
then
is
an
initial
difficulty
in
the
way
of
applying
the
maxim
this
is
partly
no
doubt
to
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
it
is
physically
impossible
for
a
man
to
see
himself
in
the
glass
except
with
face
turned
straight
towards
it
and
perfectly
motionless
where
the
expression
of
the
eye
which
counts
for
so
much
and
really
gives
its
whole
character
to
the
face
is
to
a
great
extent
lost
but
with
this
physical
impossibility
there
seems
to
me
to
be
an
ethical
impossibility
of
an
analogous
nature
and
producing
the
same
effect
a
man
can
not
look
upon
his
own
reflection
as
though
the
person
presented
there
were
to
him
and
yet
this
is
necessary
if
he
is
to
take
objective
in
the
last
resort
an
objective
view
means
a
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
individual
as
a
moral
being
that
that
which
he
is
contemplating
is
and
unless
he
can
take
this
point
of
view
he
will
not
see
things
in
a
really
true
light
which
is
possible
only
if
he
is
alive
to
their
actual
defects
exactly
as
they
are
instead
of
that
when
a
man
sees
himself
in
the
glass
something
out
of
his
own
egotistic
nature
whispers
to
him
to
take
care
to
remember
that
is
no
stranger
but
himself
that
he
is
looking
and
this
operates
as
a
me
tang
and
prevents
him
taking
an
objective
view
it
seems
indeed
as
if
without
the
leaven
of
a
grain
of
malice
such
a
view
were
impossible
footnote

according
as
a
man
mental
energy
is
exerted
or
relaxed
will
life
appear
to
him
either
so
short
and
petty
and
fleeting
that
nothing
can
possibly
happen
over
which
it
is
worth
his
while
to
spend
emotion
that
nothing
really
matters
whether
it
is
pleasure
or
riches
or
even
fame
and
that
in
whatever
way
a
man
may
have
failed
he
can
not
have
lost
much
or
on
the
other
hand
life
will
seem
so
long
so
important
so
all
in
all
so
momentous
and
so
full
of
difficulty
that
we
have
to
plunge
into
it
with
our
whole
soul
if
we
are
to
obtain
a
share
of
its
goods
make
sure
of
its
prizes
and
carry
out
our
plans
this
latter
is
the
immanent
and
common
view
of

it
is
what

he
speaks
of
the
serious

of
looking
at
things

the

is
the

this
condition
of
mind
is
due
to
the
intellect
having
got
the
upper
hand
in
the
domain
of
consciousness
where
freed
from
the
mere
service
of
the
will
it
looks
upon
the
phenomena
of
life
objectively
and
so
can
not
fail
to
gain
a
clear
insight
into
its
vain
and
futile
character
but
in
the
other
condition
of
mind
will
predominates
and
the
intellect
exists
only
to
light
it
on
its
way
to
the
attainment
of
its
desires
a
man
is
great
or
small
according
as
he
leans
to
the
one
or
the
other
of
these
views
of
life
people
of
very
brilliant
ability
think
little
of
admitting
their
errors
and
weaknesses
or
of
letting
others
see
them
they
look
upon
them
as
something
for
which
they
have
duly
paid
and
instead
of
fancying
that
these
weaknesses
are
a
disgrace
to
them
they
consider
they
are
doing
them
an
honor
this
is
especially
the
case
when
the
errors
are
of
the
kind
that
hang
together
with
their
qualities
sine
quibus
or
as
george
sand
said
défauts
de
ses
contrarily
there
are
people
of
good
character
and
irreproachable
intellectual
capacity
who
far
from
admitting
the
few
little
weaknesses
they
have
conceal
them
with
care
and
show
themselves
very
sensitive
to
any
suggestion
of
their
existence
and
this
just
because
their
whole
merit
consists
in
being
free
from
error
and
infirmity
if
these
people
are
found
to
have
done
anything
wrong
their
reputation
immediately
suffers
with
people
of
only
moderate
ability
modesty
is
mere
honesty
but
with
those
who
possess
great
talent
it
is
hypocrisy
hence
it
is
just
as
becoming
in
the
latter
to
make
no
secret
of
the
respect
they
bear
themselves
and
no
disguise
of
the
fact
that
they
are
conscious
of
unusual
power
as
it
is
in
the
former
to
be
modest
valerius
maximus
gives
some
very
neat
examples
of
this
in
his
chapter
on
fiducia
not
to
go
to
the
theatre
is
like
making
one
toilet
without
a
mirror
but
it
is
still
worse
to
take
a
decision
without
consulting
a
friend
for
a
man
may
have
the
most
excellent
judgment
in
all
other
matters
and
yet
go
wrong
in
those
which
concern
himself
because
here
the
will
comes
in
and
deranges
the
intellect
at
once
therefore
let
a
man
take
counsel
of
a
friend
a
doctor
can
cure
everyone
but
himself
if
he
falls
ill
he
sends
for
a
colleague
in
all
that
we
do
we
wish
more
or
less
to
come
to
the
end
we
are
impatient
to
finish
and
glad
to
be
done
but
the
last
scene
of
all
the
general
end
is
something
that
as
a
rule
we
wish
as
far
off
as
may
be
every
parting
gives
a
foretaste
of
death
every
coming
together
again
a
foretaste
of
the
resurrection
this
is
why
even
people
who
were
indifferent
to
each
other
rejoice
so
much
if
they
come
together
again
after
twenty
or
thirty
years
separation
intellects
differ
from
one
another
in
a
very
real
and
fundamental
way
but
no
comparison
can
well
be
made
by
merely
general
observations
it
is
necessary
to
come
close
and
to
go
into
details
for
the
difference
that
exists
can
not
be
seen
from
afar
and
it
is
not
easy
to
judge
by
outward
appearances
as
in
the
several
cases
of
education
leisure
and
occupation
but
even
judging
by
these
alone
it
must
be
admitted
that
many
a
man
has
degree
of
at
least
ten
times
as
high
as
another
in
other
words
exists
ten
times
as
much
i
am
not
speaking
here
of
savages
whose
life
is
often
only
one
degree
above
that
of
the
apes
in
their
woods
consider
for
instance
a
porter
in
naples
or
venice
in
the
north
of
europe
solicitude
for
the
winter
months
makes
people
more
thoughtful
and
therefore
reflective
look
at
the
life
he
leads
from
its
beginning
to
its
end
driven
by
poverty
living
on
his
physical
strength
meeting
the
needs
of
every
day
nay
of
every
hour
by
hard
work
great
effort
constant
tumult
want
in
all
its
forms
no
care
for
the
morrow
his
only
comfort
rest
after
exhaustion
continuous
quarreling
not
a
moment
free
for
reflection
such
sensual
delights
as
a
mild
climate
and
only
just
sufficient
food
will
permit
of
and
then
finally
as
the
metaphysical
element
the
crass
superstition
of
his
church
the
whole
forming
a
manner
of
life
with
only
a
low
degree
of
consciousness
where
a
man
hustles
or
rather
is
hustled
through
his
existence
this
restless
and
confused
dream
forms
the
life
of
how
many
millions
such
men
only
just
so
much
as
is
necessary
to
carry
out
their
will
for
the
moment
they
never
reflect
upon
their
life
as
a
connected
whole
let
alone
then
upon
existence
in
general
to
a
certain
extent
they
may
be
said
to
exist
without
really
knowing
it
the
existence
of
the
mobsman
or
the
slave
who
lives
on
in
this
unthinking
way
stands
very
much
nearer
than
ours
to
that
of
the
brute
which
is
confined
entirely
to
the
present
moment
but
for
that
very
reason
it
has
also
less
of
pain
in
it
than
ours
nay
since
all
pleasure
is
in
its
nature
negative
that
is
to
say
consists
in
freedom
from
some
form
of
misery
or
need
the
constant
and
rapid
interchange
between
setting
about
something
and
getting
it
done
which
is
the
permanent
accompaniment
of
the
work
they
do
and
then
again
the
augmented
form
which
this
takes
when
they
go
from
work
to
rest
and
the
satisfaction
of
their
needs
all
this
gives
them
a
constant
source
of
enjoyment
and
the
fact
that
it
is
much
commoner
to
see
happy
faces
amongst
the
poor
than
amongst
the
rich
is
a
sure
proof
that
it
is
used
to
good
advantage
passing
from
this
kind
of
man
consider
next
the
sober
sensible
merchant
who
leads
a
life
of
speculation
thinks
long
over
his
plans
and
carries
them
out
with
great
care
founds
a
house
and
provides
for
his
wife
his
children
and
descendants
takes
his
share
too
in
the
life
of
a
community
it
is
obvious
that
a
man
like
this
has
a
much
higher
degree
of
consciousness
than
the
former
and
so
his
existence
has
a
higher
degree
of
reality
then
look
at
the
man
of
learning
who
investigates
it
may
be
the
history
of
the
past
he
will
have
reached
the
point
at
which
a
man
becomes
conscious
of
existence
as
a
whole
sees
beyond
the
period
of
his
own
life
beyond
his
own
personal
interests
thinking
over
the
whole
course
of
the
world
history
then
finally
look
at
the
poet
or
the
philosopher
in
whom
reflection
has
reached
such
a
height
that
instead
of
being
drawn
on
to
investigate
any
one
particular
phenomenon
of
existence
he
stands
in
amazement
existence
this
great
sphinx
and
makes
it
his
problem
in
him
consciousness
has
reached
the
degree
of
clearness
at
which
it
embraces
the
world
itself
his
intellect
has
completely
abandoned
its
function
as
the
servant
of
his
will
and
now
holds
the
world
before
him
and
the
world
calls
upon
him
much
more
to
examine
and
consider
it
than
to
play
a
part
in
it
himself
if
then
the
degree
of
consciousness
is
the
degree
of
reality
such
a
man
will
be
said
to
exist
most
of
all
and
there
will
be
sense
and
significance
in
so
describing
him
between
the
two
extremes
here
sketched
and
the
intervening
stages
everyone
will
be
able
to
find
the
place
at
which
he
himself
stands
we
know
that
man
is
in
general
superior
to
all
other
animals
and
this
is
also
the
case
in
his
capacity
for
being
trained
mohammedans
are
trained
to
pray
with
their
faces
turned
towards
mecca
five
times
a
day
and
they
never
fail
to
do
it
christians
are
trained
to
cross
themselves
on
certain
occasions
to
bow
and
so
on
indeed
it
may
be
said
that
religion
is
the
of
the
art
of
training
because
it
trains
people
in
the
way
they
shall
think
and
as
is
well
known
you
can
not
begin
the
process
too
early
there
is
no
absurdity
so
palpable
but
that
it
may
be
firmly
planted
in
the
human
head
if
you
only
begin
to
inculcate
it
before
the
age
of
five
by
constantly
repeating
it
with
an
air
of
great
solemnity
for
as
in
the
case
of
animals
so
in
that
of
men
training
is
successful
only
when
you
begin
in
early
youth
noblemen
and
gentlemen
are
trained
to
hold
nothing
sacred
but
their
word
of
honor
to
maintain
a
zealous
rigid
and
unshaken
belief
in
the
ridiculous
code
of
chivalry
and
if
they
are
called
upon
to
do
so
to
seal
their
belief
by
dying
for
it
and
seriously
to
regard
a
king
as
a
being
of
a
higher
order
again
our
expressions
of
politeness
the
compliments
we
make
in
particular
the
respectful
attentions
we
pay
to
ladies
are
a
matter
of
training
as
also
our
esteem
for
good
birth
rank
titles
and
so
on
of
the
same
character
is
the
resentment
we
feel
at
any
insult
directed
against
us
and
the
measure
of
this
resentment
may
be
exactly
determined
by
the
nature
of
the
insult
an
englishman
for
instance
thinks
it
a
deadly

be
told
that
he
is
no
gentleman
or
still
worse
that
he
is

you

him
a

a

there
are

particular

while
they
have
little

to
boast
of
in
anything

will
not

your
money
but
he
will
lay

on
everything
of
yours
that
he
can
enjoy
without
having
to

a
man
of
business
will
often
deceive
you
without

he
will
absolutely
refuse
to
commit
a
theft
imagination
is
strong
in
a
man
when
that
particular
function
of
the
brain
which
enables
him
to
observe
is
roused
to
activity
without
any
necessary
excitement
of
the
senses
accordingly
we
find
that
imagination
is
active
just
in
proportion
as
our
senses
are
not
excited
by
external
objects
a
long
period
of
solitude
whether
in
prison
or
in
a
sick
room
quiet
twilight
darkness
these
are
the
things
that
promote
its
activity
and
under
their
influence
it
comes
into
play
of
itself
on
the
other
hand
when
a
great
deal
of
material
is
presented
to
our
faculties
of
observation
as
happens
on
a
journey
or
in
the
of
the
world
or
again
in
broad
daylight
the
imagination
is
idle
and
even
though
call
may
be
made
upon
it
refuses
to
become
active
as
though
it
understood
that
that
was
not
its
proper
time
however
if
the
imagination
is
to
yield
any
real
product
it
must
have
received
a
great
deal
of
material
from
the
external
world
this
is
the
only
way
in
which
its
storehouse
can
be
filled
the
phantasy
is
nourished
much
in
the
same
way
as
the
body
which
is
least
capable
of
any
work
and
enjoys
doing
nothing
just
in
the
very
moment
when
it
receives
its
food
which
it
has
to
digest
and
yet
it
is
to
this
very
food
that
it
owes
the
power
which
it
afterwards
puts
forth
at
the
right
time
opinion
is
like
a
pendulum
and
obeys
the
same
law
if
it
goes
past
the
centre
of
gravity
on
one
side
it
must
go
a
like
distance
on
the
other
and
it
is
only
after
a
certain
time
that
it
finds
the
true
point
at
which
it
can
remain
at
rest
by
a
process
of
contradiction
distance
in
space
makes
things
look
small
and
therefore
free
from
defect
this
is
why
a
landscape
looks
so
much
better
in
a
contracting
mirror
or
in
a
than
it
is
in
reality
the
same
effect
is
produced
by
distance
in
time
the
scenes
and
events
of
long
ago
and
the
persons
who
took
part
in
them
wear
a
charming
aspect
to
the
eye
of
memory
which
sees
only
the
outlines
and
takes
no
note
of
disagreeable
details
the
present
enjoys
no
such
advantage
and
so
it
always
seems
defective
and
again
as
regards
space
small
objects
close
to
us
look
big
and
if
they
are
very
close
we
may
be
able
to
see
nothing
else
but
when
we
go
a
little
way
off
they
become
minute
and
invisible
it
is
the
same
again
as
regards
time
the
little
incidents
and
accidents
of
every
day
fill
us
with
emotion
anxiety
annoyance
passion
as
long
as
they
are
close
to
us
when
they
appear
so
big
so
important
so
serious
but
as
soon
as
they
are
borne
down
the
restless
stream
of
time
they
lose
what
significance
they
had
we
think
no
more
of
them
and
soon
forget
them
altogether
they
were
big
only
because
they
were
near
and
are
not
ideas
of
the
mind
but
affections
of
the
will
and
so
they
do
not
lie
in
the
domain
of
memory
we
can
not
recall
our
joys
and
sorrows
by
which
i
mean
that
we
can
not
renew
them
we
can
recall
only
the
that
accompanied
them
and
in
particular
the
things
we
were
led
to
say
and
these
form
a
gauge
of
our
feelings
at
the
time
hence
our
memory
of
joys
and
sorrows
is
always
imperfect
and
they
become
a
matter
of
indifference
to
us
as
soon
as
they
are
over
this
explains
the
vanity
of
the
attempt
which
we
sometimes
make
to
revive
the
pleasures
and
the
pains
of
the
past
pleasure
and
pain
are
essentially
an
affair
of
the
will
and
the
will
as
such
is
not
possessed
of
memory
which
is
a
function
of
the
intellect
and
this
in
its
turn
gives
out
and
takes
in
nothing
but
thoughts
and
ideas
which
are
not
here
in
question
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
in
bad
days
we
can
very
vividly
recall
the
good
time
that
is
now
no
more
but
that
in
good
days
we
have
only
a
very
cold
and
imperfect
memory
of
the
bad
we
have
a
much
better
memory
of
actual
objects
or
pictures
than
for
mere
ideas
hence
a
good
imagination
makes
it
easier
to
learn
languages
for
by
its
aid
the
new
word
is
at
once
united
with
the
actual
object
to
which
it
refers
whereas
if
there
is
no
imagination
it
is
simply
put
on
a
parallel
with
the
equivalent
word
in
the
mother
tongue
mnemonics
should
not
only
mean
the
art
of
keeping
something
indirectly
in
the
memory
by
the
use
of
some
direct
pun
or
witticism
it
should
rather
be
applied
to
a
systematic
theory
of
memory
and
explain
its
several
attributes
by
reference
both
to
its
real
nature
and
to
the
relation
in
which
these
attributes
stand
to
one
another
there
are
moments
in
life
when
our
senses
obtain
a
higher
and
rarer
degree
of
clearness
apart
from
any
particular
occasion
for
it
in
the
nature
of
our
surroundings
and
explicable
rather
on
physiological
grounds
alone
as
the
result
of
some
enhanced
state
of
susceptibility
working
from
within
outwards
such
moments
remain
indelibly
impressed
upon
the
memory
and
preserve
themselves
in
their
individuality
entire
we
can
assign
no
reason
for
it
nor
explain
why
this
among
so
many
thousand
moments
like
it
should
be
specially
remembered
it
seems
as
much
a
matter
of
chance
as
when
single
specimens
of
a
whole
race
of
animals
now
extinct
are
discovered
in
the
layers
of
a
rock
or
when
on
opening
a
book
we
light
upon
an
insect
accidentally
crushed
within
the
leaves
memories
of
this
kind
are
always
sweet
and
pleasant
it
occasionally
happens
that
for
no
particular
reason
scenes
suddenly
start
up
in
the
memory
this
may
in
many
cases
be
due
to
the
action
of
some
hardly
perceptible
odor
which
accompanied
those
scenes
and
now
recurs
exactly
same
as
before
for
it
is
well
known
that
the
sense
of
smell
is
specially
effective
in
awakening
memories
and
that
in
general
it
does
not
require
much
to
rouse
a
train
of
ideas
and
i
may
say
in
passing
that
the
sense
of
sight
is
connected
with
the
understanding
the
sense
of
hearing
with
the
reason
and
as
we
see
in
the
present
case
the
sense
of
smell
with
the
memory
touch
and
taste
are
more
material
and
dependent
upon
contact
they
have
no
ideal
side

it
must
also
be
reckoned
among
the
peculiar
attributes
of
memory
that
a
slight
state
of
intoxication
often
so
greatly
enhances
the
recollection
of
past
times
and
scenes
that
all
the
circumstances
connected
with
them
come
back
much
more
clearly
than
would
be
possible
in
a
state
of
sobriety
but
that
on
the
other
hand
the
recollection
of
what
one
said
or
did
while
the
intoxication
lasted
is
more
than
usually
imperfect
nay
that
if
one
has
been
absolutely
tipsy
it
is
gone
altogether
we
may
say
then
that
whilst
intoxication
enhances
the
memory
for
what
is
past
it
allows
it
to
remember
little
of
the
present
men
need
some
kind
of
external
activity
because
they
are
inactive
within
contrarily
if
they
are
active
within
they
do
not
care
to
be
dragged
out
of
themselves
it
disturbs
and
impedes
their
thoughts
in
a
way
that
is
often
most
ruinous
to
them
i
am
not
surprised
that
some
people
are
bored
when
they
find
themselves
alone
for
they
can
not
laugh
if
they
are
quite
by
themselves
the
very
idea
of
it
seems
folly
to
them
are
we
then
to
look
upon
laughter
as
merely
o
signal
for
others
a
mere
sign
like
a
word
what
makes
it
impossible
for
people
to
laugh
when
they
are
alone
is
nothing

c
natural
such
as
commonly
accompanies
any
lively
talk
is
a
language
of
its
own
more
widespread
even
than
the
language
of
words
so
far
i
mean
as
it
is
independent
of
words
and
alike
in
all
nations
it
is
true
that
nations
make
use
of
it
in
proportion
as
they
are
vivacious
and
that
in
particular
cases
amongst
the
italians
for
instance
it
is
supplemented
by
certain
peculiar
gestures
which
are
merely
conventional
and
therefore
possessed
of
nothing
more
than
a
local
value
in
the
universal
use
made
of
it
gesticulation
has
some
analogy
with
logic
and
grammar
in
that
it
has
to
do
with
the
form
rather
than
with
the
matter
of
conversation
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
distinguishable
from
them
by
the
fact
that
it
has
more
of
a
moral
than
of
an
intellectual
bearing
in
other
words
it
reflects
the
movements
of
the
will
as
an
accompaniment
of
conversation
it
is
like
the
bass
of
a
melody
and
if
as
in
music
it
keeps
true
to
the
progress
of
the
treble
it
serves
to
heighten
the
effect
in
a
conversation
the
gesture
depends
upon
the
form
in
which
the
is
conveyed
and
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that
whatever
that
may
be
with
a
recurrence
of
the
form
the
very
same
gesture
is
repeated
so
if
i
happen
to
see
from
my
window
say
two
persons
carrying
on
a
lively
conversation
without
my
being
able
to
catch
a
word
i
can
nevertheless
understand
the
general
nature
of
it
perfectly
well
i
mean
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
being
said
and
the
form
it
takes
there
is
no
mistake
about
it
the
speaker
is
arguing
about
something
advancing
his
reasons
then
limiting
their
application
then
driving
them
home
and
drawing
the
conclusion
in
triumph
or
he
is
recounting
his
experiences
proving
perhaps
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
how
much
he
has
been
injured
but
bringing
the
clearest
and
most
damning
evidence
to
show
that
his
opponents
were
foolish
and
obstinate
people
who
would
not
be
convinced
or
else
he
is
telling
of
the
splendid
plan
he
laid
and
how
he
carried
it
to
a
successful
issue
or
perhaps
failed
because
the
luck
was
against
him
or
it
may
be
he
is
saying
that
he
was
completely
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
or
that
he
was
quick
in
seeing
some
traps
set
for
him
and
that
by
insisting
on
his
rights
or
by
applying
a
little
force
he
succeeded
in
frustrating
and
punishing
his
enemies
and
so
on
in
hundreds
of
cases
of
a
similar
kind
strictly
speaking
however
what
i
get
from
gesticulation
alone
is
an
abstract
notion
of
the
essential
drift
of
what
is
being
said
and
that
too
whether
i
judge
from
a
moral
or
an
intellectual
point
of
view
it
is
the
quintessence
the
true
substance
of
the
conversation
and
this
remains
identical
no
matter
what
may
have
given
rise
to
the
conversation
or
what
it
may
be
about
the
relation
between
the
two
being
that
of
a
general
idea
or
to
the
individuals
which
it
covers
as
i
have
said
the
most
interesting
and
amusing
part
of
the
matter
is
the
complete
identity
and
solidarity
of
the
gestures
used
to
denote
the
same
set
of
circumstances
even
though
by
people
of
very
different
temperament
so
that
the
gestures
become
exactly
like
words
of
a
language
alike
for
every
one
and
subject
only
to
such
small
modifications
as
depend
upon
variety
of
accent
and
education
and
yet
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
these
standing
gestures
which
every
one
uses
are
the
result
of
no
convention
or
collusion
they
are
original
and
innate
a
true
language
of
nature
consolidated
it
may
be
by
imitation
and
the
influence
of
custom
it
is
well
known
that
it
is
part
of
an
actor
duty
to
make
a
careful
study
of
gesture
and
the
same
thing
is
true
to
a
somewhat
smaller
degree
of
a
public
speaker
this
study
must
consist
chiefly
in
watching
others
and
imitating
their
movements
for
there
are
no
abstract
rules
fairly
applicable
to
the
matter
with
the
exception
of
some
very
general
leading
principles
such
as
to
take
an
example
that
the
gesture
must
not
follow
the
word
but
rather
come
immediately
before
it
by
way
of
announcing
its
approach
and
attracting
the
hearer
attention
englishmen
entertain
a
peculiar
contempt
for
gesticulation
and
look
upon
it
as
something
vulgar
and
undignified
this
seems
to
me
a
silly
prejudice
on
their
part
and
the
outcome
of
their
general
prudery
for
here
we
have
a
language
which
nature
has
given
to
every
one
and
which
every
one
understands
and
to
do
away
with
and
forbid
it
for
no
better
reason
than
that
it
is
opposed
to
that
thing
gentlemanly
feeling
is
a
very
questionable
proceeding
on
education
the
human
intellect
is
said
to
be
so
constituted
that
arise
by
abstraction
from
and
therefore
come
after
them
in
point
of
time
if
this
is
what
actually
occurs
as
happens
in
the
case
of
a
man
who
has
to
depend
solely
upon
his
own
experience
for
what
he
learns
who
has
no
teacher
and
no
book
such
a
man
knows
quite
well
which
of
his
particular
observations
belong
to
and
are
represented
by
each
of
his
general
ideas
he
has
a
perfect
acquaintance
with
both
sides
of
his
experience
and
accordingly
he
treats
everything
that
comes
in
his
way
from
a
right
standpoint
this
might
be
called
the
method
of
education
contrarily
the
method
is
to
hear
what
other
people
say
to
learn
and
to
read
and
so
to
get
your
head
crammed
full
of
general
ideas
before
you
have
any
sort
of
extended
acquaintance
with
the
world
as
it
is
and
as
you
may
see
it
for
yourself
you
will
be
told
that
the
particular
observations
which
go
to
make
these
general
ideas
will
come
to
you
later
on
in
the
course
of
experience
but
until
that
time
arrives
you
apply
your
general
ideas
wrongly
you
judge
men
and
things
from
a
wrong
standpoint
you
see
them
in
a
wrong
light
and
treat
them
in
a
wrong
way
so
it
is
that
education
perverts
the
mind
this
explains
why
it
so
frequently
happens
that
after
a
long
course
of
learning
and
reading
we
enter
upon
the
world
in
our
youth
partly
with
an
artless
ignorance
of
things
partly
with
wrong
notions
about
them
so
that
our
demeanor
savors
at
one
moment
of
a
nervous
anxiety
at
another
of
a
mistaken
confidence
the
reason
of
this
is
simply
that
our
head
is
full
of
general
ideas
which
we
are
now
trying
to
turn
to
some
use
but
which
we
hardly
ever
apply
rightly
this
is
the
result
of
acting
in
direct
opposition
to
the
natural
development
of
the
mind
by
obtaining
general
ideas
first
and
particular
observations
last
it
is
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse
instead
of
developing
the
child
own
faculties
of
discernment
and
teaching
it
to
judge
and
think
for
itself
the
teacher
uses
all
his
energies
to
stuff
its
head
full
of
the
thoughts
of
other
people
the
mistaken
views
of
life
which
spring
from
a
false
application
of
general
ideas
have
afterwards
to
be
corrected
by
long
years
of
experience
and
it
is
seldom
that
they
are
wholly
corrected
this
is
why
so
few
men
of
learning
are
possessed
of
such
as
is
often
to
be
met
with
in
people
who
have
had
no
instruction
at
all
acquire
a
knowledge
of
the
might
be
defined
as
the
aim
of
all
education
and
it
follows
from
what
i
have
said
that
special
stress
should
be
laid
upon
beginning
to
acquire
this
knowledge
the
right
as
i
have
shown
this
means
in
the
main
that
the
particular
observation
of
a
thing
shall
precede
the
general
idea
of
it
further
that
narrow
and
circumscribed
ideas
shall
come
before
ideas
of
a
wide
range
it
means
therefore
that
the
whole
system
of
education
shall
follow
in
the
steps
that
must
have
been
taken
by
the
ideas
themselves
in
the
course
of
their
formation
but
whenever
any
of
these
steps
are
skipped
or
left
out
the
instruction
is
defective
and
the
ideas
obtained
are
false
and
finally
a
distorted
view
of
the
world
arises
peculiar
to
the
individual
himself
a
view
such
as
almost
everyone
entertains
for
some
time
and
most
men
for
as
long
as
they
live
no
one
can
look
into
his
own
mind
without
seeing
that
it
was
only
after
reaching
a
very
mature
age
and
in
some
cases
when
he
least
expected
it
that
he
came
to
a
right
understanding
or
a
clear
view
of
many
matters
in
his
life
that
after
all
were
not
very
difficult
or
complicated
up
till
then
they
were
points
in
his
knowledge
of
the
world
which
were
still
obscure
due
to
his
having
skipped
some
particular
lesson
in
those
early
days
of
his
education
whatever
it
may
have
been
like
whether
artificial
and
conventional
or
of
that
natural
kind
which
is
based
upon
individual
experience
it
follows
that
an
attempt
should
be
made
to
find
out
the
strictly
natural
course
of
knowledge
so
that
education
may
proceed
methodically
by
keeping
to
it
and
that
children
may
become
acquainted
with
the
ways
of
the
world
without
getting
wrong
ideas
into
their
heads
which
very
often
can
not
be
got
out
again
if
this
plan
were
adopted
special
care
would
have
to
be
taken
to
prevent
children
from
using
words
without
clearly
understanding
their
meaning
and
application
the
fatal
tendency
to
be
satisfied
with
words
instead
of
trying
to
understand
things
to
learn
phrases
by
heart
so
that
they
may
prove
a
refuge
in
time
of
need
exists
as
a
rule
even
in
children
and
the
tendency
lasts
on
into
manhood
making
the
knowledge
of
many
learned
persons
to
consist
in
mere
verbiage
however
the
main
endeavor
must
always
be
to
let
particular
observations
precede
general
ideas
and
not
as
is
usually
and
unfortunately
the
case
as
though
a
child
should
come
feet
foremost
into
the
world
or
a
verse
be
begun
by
writing
down
the
rhyme
the
ordinary
method
is
to
imprint
ideas
and
opinions
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
on
the
mind
of
the
child
before
it
has
had
any
but
a
very
few
particular
observations
it
is
thus
that
he
afterwards
comes
to
view
the
world
and
gather
experience
through
the
medium
of
those
ideas
rather
than
to
let
his
ideas
be
formed
for
him
out
of
his
own
experience
of
life
as
they
ought
to
be
a
man
sees
a
great
many
things
when
he
looks
at
the
world
for
himself
and
he
sees
them
from
many
sides
but
this
method
of
learning
is
not
nearly
so
short
or
so
quick
as
the
method
which
employs
abstract
ideas
and
makes
hasty
generalizations
about
everything
experience
therefore
will
be
a
long
time
in
correcting
preconceived
ideas
or
perhaps
never
bring
its
task
to
an
end
for
wherever
a
man
finds
that
the
aspect
of
things
seems
to
contradict
the
general
ideas
he
has
formed
he
will
begin
by
rejecting
the
evidence
it
offers
as
partial
and
nay
he
will
shut
his
eyes
to
it
altogether
and
deny
that
it
stands
in
any
contradiction
at
all
with
his
preconceived
notions
in
order
that
he
may
thus
preserve
them
uninjured
so
it
is
that
many
a
man
carries
about
a
burden
of
wrong
notions
all
his
life
long
crotchets
whims
fancies
prejudices
which
at
last
become
fixed
ideas
the
fact
is
that
he
has
never
tried
to
form
his
fundamental
ideas
for
himself
out
of
his
own
experience
of
life
his
own
way
of
looking
at
the
world
because
he
has
taken
over
his
ideas
from
other
people
and
this
it
is
that
makes
him
as
it
makes
how
many
others
so
shallow
and
superficial
instead
of
that
method
of
instruction
care
should
be
taken
to
educate
children
on
the
natural
lines
no
idea
should
ever
be
established
in
a
child
mind
otherwise
than
by
what
the
child
can
see
for
itself
or
at
any
rate
it
should
be
verified
by
the
same
means
and
the
result
of
this
would
be
that
the
child
ideas
if
few
would
be
and
accurate
it
would
learn
how
to
measure
things
by
its
own
standard
rather
than
by
another
and
so
it
would
escape
a
thousand
strange
fancies
and
prejudices
and
not
need
to
have
them
eradicated
by
the
lessons
it
will
subsequently
be
taught
in
the
school
of
life
the
child
would
in
this
way
have
its
mind
once
for
all
habituated
to
clear
views
and
knowledge
it
would
use
its
own
judgment
and
take
an
unbiased
estimate
of
things
and
in
general
children
should
not
form
their
notions
of
what
life
is
like
from
the
copy
before
they
have
learned
it
from
the
original
to
whatever
aspect
of
it
their
attention
may
be
directed
instead
therefore
of
hastening
to
place
and
books
alone
in
their
hands
let
them
be
made
acquainted
step
by
step
with
with
the
actual
circumstances
of
human
life
and
above
all
let
care
be
taken
to
bring
them
to
a
clear
and
objective
view
of
the
world
as
it
is
to
educate
them
always
to
derive
their
ideas
directly
from
real
life
and
to
shape
them
in
conformity
with
it
not
to
fetch
them
from
other
sources
such
as
books
fairy
tales
or
what
people
say
then
to
apply
them
to
real
life
for
this
will
mean
that
their
heads
are
full
of
wrong
notions
and
that
they
will
either
see
things
in
a
false
light
or
try
in
vain
to
the
to
suit
their
views
and
so
enter
upon
false
paths
and
that
too
whether
they
are
only
constructing
theories
of
life
or
engaged
in
the
actual
business
of
it
it
is
incredible
how
much
harm
is
done
when
the
seeds
of
wrong
notions
are
laid
in
the
mind
in
those
early
years
later
on
to
bear
a
crop
of
prejudice
for
the
subsequent
lessons
which
are
learned
from
real
life
in
the
world
have
to
be
devoted
mainly
to
their
extirpation
unlearn
the
was
the
answer
according
to
diogenes
laertius
antisthenes
gave
when
he
was
asked
what
branch
of
knowledge
was
most
necessary
and
we
can
see
what
he
meant
footnote
vi
no
child
under
the
age
of
fifteen
should
receive
instruction
in
subjects
which
may
possibly
be
the
vehicle
of
serious
error
such
as
philosophy
religion
or
any
other
branch
of
knowledge
where
it
is
necessary
to
take
large
views
because
wrong
notions
imbibed
early
can
seldom
be
rooted
out
and
of
all
the
intellectual
faculties
judgment
is
the
last
to
arrive
at
maturity
the
child
should
give
its
attention
either
to
subjects
where
no
error
is
possible
at
all
such
as
mathematics
or
to
those
in
which
there
is
no
particular
danger
in
making
a
mistake
such
as
languages
natural
science
history
and
so
on
and
in
general
the
branches
of
knowledge
which
are
to
be
studied
at
any
period
of
life
should
be
such
as
the
mind
is
equal
to
at
that
period
and
can
perfectly
understand
childhood
and
youth
form
the
time
for
collecting
materials
for
getting
a
special
and
thorough
knowledge
of
the
individual
and
particular
things
in
those
years
it
is
too
early
to
form
views
on
a
large
scale
and
ultimate
explanations
must
be
put
off
to
a
later
date
the
faculty
of
judgment
which
can
not
come
into
play
without
mature
experience
should
be
left
to
itself
and
care
should
be
taken
not
to
anticipate
its
action
by
inculcating
prejudice
which
will
paralyze
it
for
ever
on
the
other
hand
the
memory
should
be
specially
taxed
in
youth
since
it
is
then
that
it
is
strongest
and
most
tenacious
but
in
choosing
the
things
that
should
be
committed
to
memory
the
utmost
care
and
forethought
must
be
exercised
as
lessons
well
learnt
in
youth
are
never
forgotten
this
precious
soil
must
therefore
be
cultivated
so
as
to
bear
as
much
fruit
as
possible
if
you
think
how
deeply
rooted
in
your
memory
are
those
persons
whom
you
knew
in
the
first
twelve
years
of
your
life
how
indelible
the
impression
made
upon
you
by
the
events
of
those
years
how
clear
your
recollection
of
most
of
the
things
that
happened
to
you
then
most
of
what
was
told
or
taught
you
it
will
seem
a
natural
thing
to
take
the
susceptibility
and
tenacity
of
the
mind
at
that
period
as
the
of
education
this
may
be
done
by
a
strict
observance
of
method
and
a
systematic
regulation
of
the
impressions
which
the
mind
is
to
receive
but
the
years
of
youth
allotted
to
a
man
are
short
and
memory
is
in
general
bound
within
narrow
limits
still
more
so
the
memory
of
any
one
individual
since
this
is
the
case
it
is
to
fill
the
memory
with
what
is
essential
and
material
in
any
branch
of
knowledge
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
the
decision
as
to
what
is
essential
and
material
should
rest
with
the
masterminds
in
every
department
of
thought
their
choice
should
be
made
after
the
most
mature
deliberation
and
the
outcome
of
it
fixed
and
determined
such
a
choice
would
have
to
proceed
by
sifting
the
things
which
it
is
necessary
and
important
for
a
man
to
know
in
general
and
then
necessary
and
important
for
him
to
know
in
any
particular
business
or
calling
knowledge
of
the
first
kind
would
have
to
be
classified
after
an
encyclopaedic
fashion
in
graduated
courses
adapted
to
the
degree
of
general
culture
which
a
man
may
be
expected
to
have
in
the
circumstances
in
which
he
is
placed
beginning
with
a
course
limited
to
the
necessary
requirements
of
primary
education
and
extending
upwards
to
the
subjects
treated
of
in
all
the
branches
of
philosophical
thought
the
regulation
of
the
second
kind
of
knowledge
would
be
left
to
those
who
had
shown
genuine
mastery
in
the
several
departments
into
which
it
is
divided
and
the
whole
system
would
provide
an
elaborate
rule
or
canon
for
intellectual
education
which
would
of
course
have
to
be
revised
every
ten
years
some
such
arrangement
as
this
would
employ
the
youthful
power
of
the
memory
to
best
advantage
and
supply
excellent
working
material
to
the
faculty
of
judgment
when
it
made
its
appearance
later
on
a
man
knowledge
may
be
said
to
be
mature
in
other
words
it
has
reached
the
most
complete
state
of
perfection
to
which
he
as
an
individual
is
capable
of
bringing
it
when
an
exact
correspondence
is
established
between
the
whole
of
his
abstract
ideas
and
the
things
he
has
actually
perceived
for
himself
this
will
mean
that
each
of
his
abstract
ideas
rests
directly
or
indirectly
upon
a
basis
of
observation
which
alone
endows
it
with
any
real
value
and
also
that
he
is
able
to
place
every
observation
he
makes
under
the
right
abstract
idea
which
belongs
to
it
maturity
is
the
work
of
experience
alone
and
therefore
it
requires
time
the
knowledge
we
derive
from
our
own
observation
is
usually
distinct
from
that
which
we
acquire
through
the
medium
of
abstract
ideas
the
one
coming
to
us
in
the
natural
way
the
other
by
what
people
tell
us
and
the
course
of
instruction
we
receive
whether
it
is
good
or
bad
the
result
is
that
in
youth
there
is
generally
very
little
agreement
or
correspondence
between
our
abstract
ideas
which
are
merely
phrases
in
the
mind
and
that
real
knowledge
which
we
have
obtained
by
our
own
observation
it
is
only
later
on
that
a
gradual
approach
takes
place
between
these
two
kinds
of
knowledge
accompanied
by
a
mutual
correction
of
error
and
knowledge
is
not
mature
until
this
coalition
is
accomplished
this
maturity
or
perfection
of
knowledge
is
something
quite
independent
of
another
kind
of
perfection
which
may
be
of
a
high
or
a
low
order
the
perfection
i
mean
to
which
a
man
may
bring
his
own
individual
faculties
which
is
measured
not
by
any
correspondence
between
the
two
kinds
of
knowledge
but
by
the
degree
of
intensity
which
each
kind
attains
for
the
practical
man
the
most
needful
thing
is
to
acquire
an
accurate
and
profound
knowledge
of
ways
of
the
but
this
though
the
most
needful
is
also
the
most
wearisome
of
all
studies
as
a
man
may
reach
a
great
age
without
coming
to
the
end
of
his
task
whereas
in
the
domain
of
the
sciences
he
masters
the
more
important
facts
when
he
is
still
young
in
acquiring
that
knowledge
of
the
world
it
is
while
he
is
a
novice
namely
in
boyhood
and
in
youth
that
the
first
and
hardest
lessons
are
put
before
him
but
it
often
happens
that
even
in
later
years
there
is
still
a
great
deal
to
be
learned
the
study
is
difficult
enough
in
itself
but
the
difficulty
is
doubled
by
which
represent
a
state
of
things
in
life
and
the
world
such
as
in
fact
does
not
exist
youth
is
credulous
and
accepts
these
views
of
life
which
then
become
part
and
parcel
of
the
mind
so
that
instead
of
a
merely
negative
condition
of
ignorance
you
have
positive
error
a
whole
tissue
of
false
notions
to
start
with
and
at
a
later
date
these
actually
spoil
the
schooling
of
experience
and
put
a
wrong
construction
on
the
lessons
it
teaches
if
before
this
the
youth
had
no
light
at
all
to
guide
him
he
is
now
misled
by
a
still
more
often
is
this
the
case
with
a
girl
they
have
both
had
a
false
view
of
things
foisted
on
them
by
reading
novels
and
expectations
have
been
aroused
which
can
never
be
fulfilled
this
generally
exercises
a
baneful
influence
on
their
whole
life
in
this
respect
those
whose
youth
has
allowed
them
no
time
or
opportunity
for
reading
novels
those
who
work
with
their
hands
and
the
like
are
in
a
position
of
decided
advantage
there
are
a
few
novels
to
which
this
reproach
can
not
be
addressed
nay
which
have
an
effect
the
contrary
of
bad

and
foremost
to
give
an
example
and
the
other
works
of
le
sage
or
rather
their
spanish
originals
further
vicar
of
and
to
some
extent
sir

scott
novels
may
be
regarded
as
a
satirical
exhibition
of
the
error
to
which
i
am
referring
of
women
schiller
poem
in
honor
of

der
is
the
result
of
much
careful
thought
and
it
appeals
to
the
reader
by
its
antithetic
style
and
its
use
of
contrast
but
as
an
expression
of
the
true
praise
which
should
be
accorded
to
them
it
is
i
think
inferior
to
these
few
words
of
jouy
women
the
beginning
of
our
life
would
be
helpless
the
middle
devoid
of
pleasure
and
the
end
of
the
same
thing
is
more
feelingly
expressed

first
of

spring
from

your
first
small
words

taught
you
from
her
lips
your
first
tears

by
her
and
your
last
sighs
too
often
breathed
out
in
a
woman
hearing
when
men
have
shrunk
from
the
ignoble
care
of
watching
the
last
hour
of
him
who
led

these
two
passages
indicate
the
right
standpoint
for
the
appreciation
of
women
you
need
only
look
at
the
way
in
which
she
is
formed
to
see
that
woman
is
not
meant
to
undergo
great
labor
whether
of
the
mind
or
of
the
body
she
pays
the

by
what

and
care
for

and
by
submission
to
her

to

she
should

the
keenest
sorrows
and
joys
are
not

is
she
called
upon
to
display
a

of

the

happier

unhappier
women
are
directly
fitted
for
acting
as
the
nurses
and
teachers
of
our
early
childhood
by
the
fact
that
they
are
themselves
childish
frivolous
and
in
a
word
they
are
big
children
all
their
life
long
a
kind
of
intermediate
stage
between
the
child
and
the
man
who
is
man
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
see
how
a
girl
will
fondle
a
child
for
days
together
dance
with
it
and
sing
to
it
and
then
think
what
a
man
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
could
do
if
he
were
put
in
her
place
with
young
girls
nature
seems
to
have
had
in
view
what
in
the
language
of
the
drama
is
called
striking
as
for
a
few
years
she
dowers
them
with
a
wealth
of
beauty
and
is
lavish
in
her
gift
of
charm
at
the
expense
of
all
the
rest
of
their
life
so
that
during
those
years
they
may
capture
the
fantasy
of
some
man
to
such
a
degree
that
he
is
hurried
away
into
undertaking
the
honorable
care
of
them
in
some
form
or
other
as
long
as
they
live
a
step
for
which
there
would
not
appear
to
be
any
sufficient
warranty
if
reason
only
directed
his
thoughts
accordingly
nature
has
equipped
woman
as
she
does
all
her
creatures
with
the
weapons
and
implements
requisite
for
the
safeguarding
of
her
existence
and
for
just
as
long
as
it
is
necessary
for
her
to
have
them
here
as
elsewhere
nature
proceeds
with
her
usual
economy
for
just
as
the
female
ant
after
fecundation
loses
her
wings
which
are
then
superfluous
nay
actually
a
danger
to
the
business
of
breeding
so
after
giving
birth
to
one
or
two
children
a
woman
generally
loses
her
beauty
probably
indeed
for
similar
reasons
and
so
we
find
that
young
girls
in
their
hearts
look
upon
domestic
affairs
or
work
of
any
kind
as
of
secondary
importance
if
not
actually
as
a
mere
jest
the
only
business
that
really
claims
their
earnest
attention
is
love
making
conquests
and
everything
connected
with
this
dress
dancing
and
so
on
the
nobler
and
more
perfect
a
thing
is
the
later
and
slower
it
is
in
arriving
at
maturity
a
man
reaches
the
maturity
of
his
reasoning
powers
and
mental
faculties
hardly
before
the
age
of
a
woman
at
eighteen
and
then
too
in
the
case
of
woman
it
is
only
reason
of
a
sort
very
niggard
in
its
dimensions
that
is
why
women
remain
children
their
whole
life
long
never
seeing
anything
but
what
is
quite
close
to
them
cleaving
to
the
present
moment
taking
appearance
for
reality
and
preferring
trifles
to
matters
of
the
first
importance
for
it
is
by
virtue
of
his
reasoning
faculty
that
man
does
not
live
in
the
present
only
like
the
brute
but
looks
about
him
and
considers
the
past
and
the
future
and
this
is
the
origin
of
prudence
as
well
as
of
that
care
and
anxiety
which
so
many
people
exhibit
both
the
advantages
and
the
disadvantages
which
this
involves
are
shared
in
by
the
woman
to
a
smaller
extent
because
of
her
weaker
power
of
reasoning
she
may
in
fact
be
described
as
intellectually
because
while
she
has
an
intuitive
understanding
of
what
lies
quite
close
to
her
her
field
of
vision
is
narrow
and
does
not
reach
to
what
is
remote
so
that
things
which
are
absent
or
past
or
to
come
have
much
less
effect
upon
women
than
upon
men
this
is
the
reason
why
women
are
more
often
inclined
to
be
extravagant
and
sometimes
carry
their
inclination
to
a
length
that
borders
upon
madness
in
their
hearts
women
think
that
it
is
men
business
to
earn
money
and
theirs
to
spend
it
if
possible
during
their
husband
life
but
at
any
rate
after
his
death
the
very
fact
that
their
husband
hands
them
over
his
earnings
for
purposes
of
housekeeping
strengthens
them
in
this
belief
however
many
disadvantages
all
this
may
involve
there
is
at
least
this
to
be
said
in
its
favor
that
the
woman
lives
more
in
the
present
than
the
man
and
that
if
the
present
is
at
all
tolerable
she
enjoys
it
more
eagerly
this
is
the
source
of
that
cheerfulness
which
is
peculiar
to
women
fitting
her
to
amuse
man
in
his
hours
of
recreation
and
in
case
of
need
to
console
him
when
he
is
borne
down
by
the
weight
of
his
cares
it
is
by
no
means
a
bad
plan
to
consult
women
in
matters
of
difficulty
as
the
germans
used
to
do
in
ancient
times
for
their
way
of
looking
at
things
is
quite
different
from
ours
chiefly
in
the
fact
that
they
like
to
take
the
shortest
way
to
their
goal
and
in
general
manage
to
fix
their
eyes
upon
what
lies
before
them
while
we
as
a
rule
see
far
beyond
it
just
because
it
is
in
front
of
our
noses
in
cases
like
this
we
need
to
be
brought
back
to
the
right
standpoint
so
as
to
recover
the
near
and
simple
view
then
again
women
are
decidedly
more
sober
in
their
judgment
than
we
are
so
that
they
do
not
see
more
in
things
than
is
really
there
whilst
if
our
passions
are
aroused
we
are
apt
to
see
things
in
an
exaggerated
way
or
imagine
what
does
not
exist
the
weakness
of
their
reasoning
faculty
also
explains
why
it
is
that
women
show
more
sympathy
for
the
unfortunate
than
men
do
and
so
treat
them
with
more
kindness
and
interest
and
why
it
is
that
on
the
contrary
they
are
inferior
to
men
in
point
of
justice
and
less
honorable
and
conscientious
for
it
is
just
because
their
reasoning
power
is
weak
that
present
circumstances
have
such
a
hold
over
them
and
those
concrete
things
which
lie
directly
before
their
eyes
exercise
a
power
which
is
seldom
counteracted
to
any
extent
by
abstract
principles
of
thought
by
fixed
rules
of
conduct
firm
resolutions
or
in
general
by
consideration
for
the
past
and
the
future
or
regard
for
what
is
absent
and
remote
accordingly
they
possess
the
first
and
main
elements
that
go
to
make
a
virtuous
character
but
they
are
deficient
in
those
secondary
qualities
which
are
often
a
necessary
instrument
in
the
formation
of
it
footnote
in
this
respect
they
may
be
compared
to
an
animal
organism
which
contains
a
liver
but
no
here
let
me
refer
to
what
i
have
said
in
my
treatise
on
foundation
of
hence
it
will
be
found
that
the
fundamental
fault
of
the
female
character
is
that
it
has
sense
of
this
is
mainly
due
to
the
fact
already
mentioned
that
women
are
defective
in
the
powers
of
reasoning
and
deliberation
but
it
is
also
traceable
to
the
position
which
nature
has
assigned
to
them
as
the
weaker
sex
they
are
dependent
not
upon
strength
but
upon
craft
and
hence
their
instinctive
capacity
for
cunning
and
their
ineradicable
tendency
to
say
what
is
not
true
for
as
lions
are
provided
with
claws
and
teeth
and
elephants
and
boars
with
tusks
bulls
with
horns
and
cuttle
fish
with
its
clouds
of
inky
fluid
so
nature
has
equipped
woman
for
her
defence
and
protection
with
the
arts
of
dissimulation
and
all
the
power
which
nature
has
conferred
upon
man
in
the
shape
of
physical
strength
and
reason
has
been
bestowed
upon
women
in
this
form
hence
dissimulation
is
innate
in
woman
and
almost
as
much
a
quality
of
the
stupid
as
of
the
clever
it
is
as
natural
for
them
to
make
use
of
it
on
every
occasion
as
it
is
for
those
animals
to
employ
their
means
of
defence
when
they
are
attacked
they
have
a
feeling
that
in
doing
so
they
are
only
within
their
rights
therefore
a
woman
who
is
perfectly
truthful
and
not
given
to
dissimulation
is
perhaps
an
impossibility
and
for
this
very
reason
they
are
so
quick
at
seeing
through
dissimulation
in
others
that
it
is
not
a
wise
thing
to
attempt
it
with
them
but
this
fundamental
defect
which
i
have
stated
with
all
that
it
entails
gives
rise
to
falsity
faithlessness
treachery
ingratitude
and
so
on
perjury
in
a
court
of
justice
is
more
often
committed
by
women
than
by
men
it
may
indeed
be
generally
questioned
whether
women
ought
to
be
sworn
in
at
all
from
time
to
time
one
finds
repeated
cases
everywhere
of
ladies
who
want
for
nothing
taking
things
from
when
no
one
is
looking
and
making
off
with
them
nature
has
appointed
that
the
propagation
of
the
species
shall
be
the
business
of
men
who
are
young
strong
and
handsome
so
that
the
race
may
not
degenerate
this
is
the
firm
will
and
purpose
of
nature
in
regard
to
the
species
and
it
finds
its
expression
in
the
passions
of
women
there
is
no
law
that
is
older
or
more
powerful
than
this
woe
then
to
the
man
who
sets
up
claims
and
interests
that
will
conflict
with
it
whatever
he
may
say
and
do
they
will
be
unmercifully
crushed
at
the
first
serious
encounter
for
the
innate
rule
that
governs
women
conduct
though
it
is
secret
and
unformulated
nay
unconscious
in
its
working
is
this
are
justified
in
deceiving
those
who
think
they
have
acquired
rights
over
the
species
by
paying
little
attention
to
the
individual
that
is
to
us
the
constitution
and
therefore
the
welfare
of
the
species
have
been
placed
in
our
hands
and
committed
to
our
care
through
the
control
we
obtain
over
the
next
generation
which
proceeds
from
us
let
us
discharge
our
duties
but
women
have
no
abstract
knowledge
of
this
leading
principle
they
are
conscious
of
it
only
as
a
concrete
fact
and
they
have
no
other
method
of
giving
expression
to
it
than
the
way
in
which
they
act
when
the
opportunity
arrives
and
then
their
conscience
does
not
trouble
them
so
much
as
we
fancy
for
in
the
darkest
recesses
of
their
heart
they
are
aware
that
in
committing
a
breach
of
their
duty
towards
the
individual
they
have
all
the
better
fulfilled
their
duty
towards
the
species
which
is
infinitely
greater
footnote
a
more
detailed
discussion
of
the
matter
in
question
may
be
found
in
my
chief
work

als

ch
and
since
women
exist
in
the
main
solely
for
the
propagation
of
the
species
and
are
not
destined
for
anything
else
they
live
as
a
rule
more
for
the
species
than
for
the
individual
and
in
their
hearts
take
the
affairs
of
the
species
more
seriously
than
those
of
the
individual
this
gives
their
whole
life
and
being
a
certain
levity
the
general
bent
of
their
character
is
in
a
direction
fundamentally
different
from
that
of
man
and
it
is
this
to
which
produces
that
discord
in
married
life
which
is
so
frequent
and
almost
the
normal
state
the
natural
feeling
between
men
is
mere
indifference
but
between
women
it
is
actual
enmity
the
reason
of
this
is
that
which
in
the
case
of
men
does
not
go
beyond
the
confines
of
their
own
particular
pursuit
but
with
women
embraces
the
whole
sex
since
they
have
only
one
kind
of
business
even
when
they
meet
in
the
street
women
look
at
one
another
like
guelphs
and
ghibellines
and
it
is
a
patent
fact
that
when
two
women
make
first
acquaintance
with
each
other
they
behave
with
more
constraint
and
dissimulation
than
two
men
would
show
in
a
like
case
and
hence
it
is
that
an
exchange
of
compliments
between
two
women
is
a
much
more
ridiculous
proceeding
than
between
two
men
further
whilst
a
man
will
as
a
general
rule
always
preserve
a
certain
amount
of
consideration
and
humanity
in
speaking
to
others
even
to
those
who
are
in
a
very
inferior
position
it
is
intolerable
to
see
how
proudly
and
disdainfully
a
fine
lady
will
generally
behave
towards
one
who
is
in
a
lower
social
rank
i
do
not
mean
a
woman
who
is
in
her
service
whenever
she
speaks
to
her
the
reason
of
this
may
be
that
with
women
differences
of
rank
are
much
more
precarious
than
with
us
because
while
a
hundred
considerations
carry
weight
in
our
case
in
theirs
there
is
only
one
namely
with
which
man
they
have
found
favor
as
also
that
they
stand
in
much
nearer
relations
with
one
another
than
men
do
in
consequence
of
the
nature
of
their
calling
this
makes
them
endeavor
to
lay
stress
upon
differences
of
rank
it
is
only
the
man
whose
intellect
is
clouded
by
his
sexual
impulses
that
could
give
the
name
of
fair
to
that
and
race
for
the
whole
beauty
of
the
sex
is
bound
up
with
this
impulse
instead
of
calling
them
beautiful
there
would
be
more
warrant
for
describing
women
as
the
sex
neither
for
music
nor
for
poetry
nor
for
fine
art
have
they
really
and
truly
any
sense
or
susceptibility
it
is
a
mere
mockery
if
they
make
a
pretence
of
it
in
order
to
assist
their
endeavor
to
please
hence
as
a
result
of
this
they
are
incapable
of
taking
a
objective
in
anything
and
the
reason
of
it
seems
to
me
to
be
as
follows
a
man
tries
to
acquire
mastery
over
things
either
by
understanding
them
or
by
forcing
them
to
do
his
will
but
a
woman
is
always
and
everywhere
reduced
to
obtaining
this
mastery
namely
through
a
man
and
whatever
direct
mastery
she
may
have
is
entirely
confined
to
him
and
so
it
lies
in
woman
nature
to
look
upon
everything
only
as
a
means
for
conquering
man
and
if
she
takes
an
interest
in
anything
else
it
is
simulated
a
mere
roundabout
way
of
gaining
her
ends
by
coquetry
and
feigning
what
she
does
not
feel
hence
even
rousseau
declared
have
in
general
no
love
for
any
art
they
have
no
proper
knowledge
of
any
and
they

no
one
who
sees
at
all
below
the
surface
can
have
failed
to
remark
the
same
thing
you
need
only
observe
the
kind
of
attention
women
bestow
upon
a
concert
an
opera
or
a
play
the
childish
simplicity
for
example
with
which
they
keep
on
chattering
during
the
finest
passages
in
the
greatest
masterpieces
if
it
is
true
that
the
greeks
excluded
women
from
their
theatres
they
were
quite
right
in
what
they
did
at
any
rate
you
would
have
been
able
to
hear
what
was
said
upon
the
stage
in
our
day
besides
or
in
lieu
of
saying
a
woman
keep
silence
in

it
would
be
much
to
the
point
to
say
a
woman
keep
silence
in

this
might
perhaps
be
put
up
in
big
letters
on
the
curtain
and
you
can
not
expect
anything
else
of
women
if
you
consider
that
the
most
distinguished
intellects
among
the
whole
sex
have
never
managed
to
produce
a
single
achievement
in
the
fine
arts
that
is
really
great
genuine
and
original
or
given
to
the
world
any
work
of
permanent
value
in
any
sphere
this
is
most
strikingly
shown
in
regard
to
painting
where
mastery
of
technique
is
at
least
as
much
within
their
power
as
within
ours
and
hence
they
are
diligent
in
cultivating
it
but
still
they
have
not
a
single
great
painting
to
boast
of
just
because
they
are
deficient
in
that
objectivity
of
mind
which
is
so
directly
indispensable
in
painting
they
never
get
beyond
a
subjective
point
of
view
it
is
quite
in
keeping
with
this

ordinary
women
have
no

she

up

to

it

just
because
there

the

why
not
as
well
as
and
the
laws
of
marriage
prevailing
in
europe
consider
the
woman
as
the
equivalent
of
the
man
start
that
is
to
say
from
a
wrong
position
in
our
part
of
the
world
where
monogamy
is
the
rule
to
marry
means
to
halve
one
rights
and
double
one
duties
now
when
the
laws
gave
women
equal
rights
with
man
they
ought
to
have
also
endowed
her
with
a
masculine
intellect
but
the
fact
is
that
just
in
proportion
as
the
honors
and
privileges
which
the
laws
accord
to
women
exceed
the
amount
which
nature
gives
is
there
a
diminution
in
the
number
of
women
who
really
participate
in
these
privileges
and
all
the
remainder
are
deprived
of
their
natural
rights
by
just
so
much
as
is
given
to
the
others
over
and
above
their
share
for
the
institution
of
monogamy
and
the
laws
of
marriage
which
it
entails
bestow
upon
the
woman
an
unnatural
position
of
privilege
by
considering
her
throughout
as
the
full
equivalent
of
the
man
which
is
by
no
means
the
case
and
seeing
this
men
who
are
shrewd
and
prudent
very
often
scruple
to
make
so
great
a
sacrifice
and
to
acquiesce
in
so
unfair
an
arrangement
consequently
whilst
among
polygamous
nations
every
woman
is
provided
for
where
monogamy
prevails
the
number
of
married
women
is
limited
and
there
remains
over
a
large
number
of
women
without
stay
or
support
who
in
the
upper
classes
vegetate
as
useless
old
maids
and
in
the
lower
succumb
to
hard
work
for
which
they
are
not
suited
or
else
become
de
whose
life
is
as
destitute
of
joy
as
it
is
of
honor
but
under
the
circumstances
they
become
a
necessity
and
their
position
is
openly
recognized
as
serving
the
special
end
of
warding
off
temptation
from
those
women
favored
by
fate
who
have
found
or
may
hope
to
find
husbands
in
london
alone
there
are
prostitutes
what
are
they
but
the
women
who
under
the
institution
of
monogamy
have
come
off
worse
theirs
is
a
dreadful
fate
they
are
human
sacrifices
offered
up
on
the
altar
of
monogamy
the
women
whose
wretched
position
is
here
described
are
the
inevitable
to
the
european
lady
with
her
arrogance
and
pretension
polygamy
is
therefore
a
real
benefit
to
the
female
sex
if
it
is
taken
as
a
whole
and
from
another
point
of
view
there
is
no
true
reason
why
a
man
whose
wife
suffers
from
chronic
illness
or
remains
barren
or
has
gradually
become
too
old
for
him
should
not
take
a
second
the
motives
which
induce
so
many
people
to
become
converts
to
mormonism
appear
to
be
just
those
which
militate
against
the
unnatural
institution
of
monogamy
footnote
the
mormons
have
recently
given
up
polygamy
and
received
the
american
franchise
in

moreover
the
bestowal
of

rights
upon
women
has
imposed
upon
them
unnatural
duties
and
nevertheless
a
breach
of
these
duties
makes
them
unhappy
let
me
explain
a
man
may
often
think
that
his
social
or
financial
position
will
suffer
if
he
marries
unless
he
makes
some
brilliant
alliance
his
desire
will
then
be
to
win
a
woman
of
his
own
choice
under
conditions
other
than
those
of
marriage
such
as
will
secure
her
position
and
that
of
the
children
however
fair
reasonable
fit
and
proper
these
conditions
may
be
and
the
woman
consents
by
foregoing
that
undue
amount
of
privilege
which
marriage
alone
can
bestow
she
to
some
extent
loses
her
honor
because
marriage
is
the
basis
of
civic
society
and
she
will
lead
an
unhappy
life
since
human
nature
is
so
constituted
that
we
pay
an
attention
to
the
opinion
of
other
people
which
is
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
value
on
the
other
hand
if
she
does
not
consent
she
runs
the
risk
either
of
having
to
be
given
in
marriage
to
a
man
whom
she
does
not
like
or
of
being
landed
high
and
dry
as
an
old
maid
for
the
period
during
which
she
has
a
chance
of
being
settled
for
life
is
very
short
and
in
view
of
this
aspect
of
the
institution
of
monogamy
profoundly
learned
treatise
is
well
worth
reading
for
it
shows
that
amongst
all
nations
and
in
all
ages
down
to
the
lutheran
reformation
concubinage
was
permitted
nay
that
it
was
an
institution
which
was
to
a
certain
extent
actually
recognized
by
law
and
attended
with
no
dishonor
it
was
only
the
lutheran
reformation
that
degraded
it
from
this
position
it
was
seen
to
be
a
further
justification
for
the
marriage
of
the
clergy
and
then
after
that
the
catholic
church
did
not
dare
to
remain
in
the
matter
there
is
no
use
arguing
about
polygamy
it
must
be
taken
as
existing
everywhere
and
the
only
question
is
as
to
how
it
shall
be
regulated
where
are
there
then
any
real
monogamists
we
all
live
at
any
rate
for
a
time
and
most
of
us
always
in
polygamy
and
so
since
every
man
needs
many
women
there
is
nothing
fairer
than
to
allow
him
nay
to
make
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
provide
for
many
women
this
will
reduce
woman
to
her
true
and
natural
position
as
a
subordinate
being
and
the
that
monster
of
european
civilization
and
stupidity
will
disappear
from
the
world
leaving
only
but
no
more
of
whom
europe
is
now
full
in
india
no
woman
is
ever
independent
but
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
mamu
she
stands
under
the
control
of
her
father
her
husband
her
brother
or
her

it
is
to
be
sure
a
revolting
thing
that
a
widow
should
immolate
herself
upon
her

but
it
is
also
revolting
that
she
should
spend
her

toiled
his
whole

ch

the
first
love
of
a
mother
for
her
child
is
with
the
lower
animals
as
with
men
of
a
purely
character
and
so
it
ceases
when
the
child
is
no
longer
in
a
physically
helpless
condition
after
that
the
first
love
should
give
way
to
one
that
is
based
on
habit
and
reason
but
this
often
fails
to
make
its
appearance
especially
where
the
mother
did
not
love
the
father
the
love
of
a
father
for
his
child
is
of
a
different
order
and
more
likely
to
last
because
it
has
its
foundation
in
the
fact
that
in
the
child
he
recognizes
his
own
inner
self
that
is
to
say
his
love
for
it
is
metaphysical
in
its
origin
in
almost
all
nations
whether
of
the
ancient
or
the
modern
world
even
amongst

hottentots

inherited
by
the
male
descendants

it
is
only
in
europe
that
a
departure
has
taken
place

not
amongst
the
nobility
however
that
the
property
which
has
cost
men
long
years
of
toil
and
effort
and
been
won
with
so
much
difficulty
should
afterwards
come
into
the
hands
of
women
who
then
in
their
lack
of
reason
squander
it
in
a
short
time
or
otherwise
fool
it
away
is
a
grievance
and
a
wrong
as
serious
as
it
is
common
which
should
be
prevented
by
limiting
the
right
of
women
to
inherit
in
my
opinion
the
best
arrangement
would
be
that
by
which
women
whether
widows
or
daughters
should
never
receive
anything
beyond
the
interest
for
life
on
property
secured
by
mortgage
and
in
no
case
the
property
itself
or
the
capital
except
where
all
male
descendants
fail
the
people
who
make
money
are
men
not
women
and
it
follows
from
this
that
women
are
neither
justified
in
having
unconditional
possession
of
it
nor
fit
persons
to
be
entrusted
with
its
administration
when
wealth
in
any
true
sense
of
the
word
that
is
to
say
funds
houses
or
land
is
to
go
to
them
as
an
inheritance
they
should
never
be
allowed
the
free
disposition
of
it
in
their
case
a
guardian
should
always
be
appointed
and
hence
they
should
never
be
given
the
free
control
of
their
own
children
wherever
it
can
be
avoided
the
vanity
of
women
even
though
it
should
not
prove
to
be
greater
than
that
of
men
has
this
much
danger
in
it
that
it
takes
an
entirely
material
direction
they
are
vain
i
mean
of
their
personal
beauty
and
then
of
finery
show
and
magnificence
that
is
just
why
they
are
so
much
in
their
element
in
society
it
is
this
too
which
makes
them
so
inclined
to
be
extravagant
all
the
more
as
their
reasoning
power
is
low

an
extreme
dislike
to
disturbance
in
any
form
as
something
that
breaks
in
upon
and
distracts
their
thoughts
above
all
have
they
been
averse
to
that
violent
interruption
that
comes
from
noise
ordinary
people
are
not
much
put
out
by
anything
of
the
sort
the
most
sensible
and
intelligent
of
all
nations
in
europe
lays
down
the
rule
as
the
eleventh
commandment
noise
is
the
most
impertinent
of
all
forms
of
interruption
it
is
not
only
an
interruption
but
also
a
disruption
of
thought
of
course
where
there
is
nothing
to
interrupt
noise
will
not
be
so
particularly
painful
occasionally
it
happens
that
some
slight
but
constant
noise
continues
to
bother
and
distract
me
for
a
time
before
i
become
distinctly
conscious
of
it
all
i
feel
is
a
steady
increase
in
the
labor
of
thinking
just
as
though
i
were
trying
to
walk
with
a
weight
on
my
foot
at
last
i
find
out
what
it
is
let
me
now
however
pass
from
genus
to
species
the
most
inexcusable
and
disgraceful
of
all
noises
is
the
cracking
of
whips
a
truly
infernal
thing
when
it
is
done
in
the
narrow
resounding
streets
of
a
town
i
denounce
it
as
making
a
peaceful
life
impossible
it
puts
an
end
to
all
quiet
thought
that
this
cracking
of
whips
should
be
allowed
at
all
seems
to
me
to
show
in
the
clearest
way
how
senseless
and
thoughtless
is
the
nature
of
mankind
no
one
with
anything
like
an
idea
in
his
head
can
avoid
a
feeling
of
actual
pain
at
this
sudden
sharp
crack
which
paralyzes
the
brain
rends
the
thread
of
reflection
and
murders
thought
every
time
this
noise
is
made
it
must
disturb
a
hundred
people
who
are
applying
their
minds
to
business
of
some
sort
no
matter
how
trivial
it
may
be
while
on
the
thinker
its
effect
is
woeful
and
disastrous
cutting
his
thoughts
asunder
much
as
the
executioner
axe
severs
the
head
from
the
body
no
sound
be
it
ever
so
shrill
cuts
so
sharply
into
the
brain
as
this
cursed
cracking
of
whips
you
feel
the
sting
of
the
lash
right
inside
your
head
and
it
affects
the
brain
in
the
same
way
as
touch
affects
a
sensitive
plant
and
for
the
same
length
of
time
with
all
due
respect
for
the
most
holy
doctrine
of
utility
i
really
can
not
see
why
a
fellow
who
is
taking
away
a
of
gravel
or
dung
should
thereby
obtain
the
right
to
kill
in
the
bud
the
thoughts
which
may
happen
to
be
springing
up
in
ten
thousand
heads
the
number
he
will
disturb
one
after
another
in
half
an
hour
drive
through
the
town
hammering
the
barking
of
dogs
and
the
crying
of
children
are
horrible
to
hear
but
your
only
genuine
assassin
of
thought
is
the
crack
of
a
whip
it
exists
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
every
pleasant
moment
of
quiet
thought
that
any
one
may
now
and
then
enjoy
if
the
driver
had
no
other
way
of
urging
on
his
horse
than
by
making
this
most
abominable
of
all
noises
it
would
be
excusable
but
quite
the
contrary
is
the
case
this
cursed
cracking
of
whips
is
not
only
unnecessary
but
even
useless
its
aim
is
to
produce
an
effect
upon
the
intelligence
of
the
horse
but
through
the
constant
abuse
of
it
the
animal
becomes
habituated
to
the
sound
which
falls
upon
blunted
feelings
and
produces
no
effect
at
all
the
horse
does
not
go
any
faster
for
it
you
have
a
remarkable
example
of
this
in
the
ceaseless
cracking
of
his
whip
on
the
part
of
a
while
he
is
proceeding
at
a
slow
pace
on
the
lookout
for
a
fare
if
he
were
to
give
his
horse
the
slightest
touch
with
the
whip
it
would
have
much
more
effect
supposing
however
that
it
were
absolutely
necessary
to
crack
the
whip
in
order
to
keep
the
horse
constantly
in
mind
of
its
presence
it
would
be
enough
to
make
the
hundredth
part
of
the
noise
for
it
is
a
fact
that
in
regard
to
sight
and
hearing
animals
are
sensitive
to
even
the
faintest
indications
they
are
alive
to
things
that
we
can
scarcely
perceive
the
most
surprising
instances
of
this
are
furnished
by
trained
dogs
and
canary
birds
it
is
obvious
therefore
that
here
we
have
to
do
with
an
act
of
pure
wantonness
nay
with
an
impudent
defiance
offered
to
those
members
of
the
community
who
work
with
their
heads
by
those
who
work
with
their
hands
that
such
infamy
should
be
tolerated
in
a
town
is
a
piece
of
barbarity
and
iniquity
all
the
more
as
it
could
easily
be
remedied
by
a
to
the
effect
that
every
lash
shall
have
a
knot
at
the
end
of
it
there
can
be
no
harm
in
drawing
the
attention
of
the
mob
to
the
fact
that
the
classes
above
them
work
with
their
heads
for
any
kind
of
headwork
is
mortal
anguish
to
the
man
in
the
street
a
fellow
who
rides
through
the
narrow
alleys
of
a
populous
town
with
unemployed
or
and
keeps
on
cracking
a
whip
several
yards
long
with
all
his
might
deserves
there
and
then
to
stand
down
and
receive
five
really
good
blows
with
a
stick
all
the
philanthropists
in
the
world
and
all
the
legislators
meeting
to
advocate
and
decree
the
total
abolition
of
corporal
punishment
will
never
persuade
me
to
the
contrary
there
is
something
even
more
disgraceful
than
what
i
have
just
mentioned
often
enough
you
may
see
a
carter
walking
along
the
street
quite
alone
without
any
horses
and
still
cracking
away
incessantly
so
accustomed
has
the
wretch
become
to
it
in
consequence
of
the
unwarrantable
toleration
of
this
practice
a
man
body
and
the
needs
of
his
body
are
now
everywhere
treated
with
a
tender
indulgence
is
the
thinking
mind
then
to
be
the
only
thing
that
is
never
to
obtain
the
slightest
measure
of
consideration
or
protection
to
say
nothing
of
respect
carters
porters
messengers
these
are
the
beasts
of
burden
amongst
mankind
by
all
means
let
them
be
treated
justly
fairly
indulgently
and
with
forethought
but
they
must
not
be
permitted
to
stand
in
the
way
of
the
higher
endeavors
of
humanity
by
wantonly
making
a
noise
how
many
great
and
splendid
thoughts
i
should
like
to
know
have
been
lost
to
the
world
by
the
crack
of
a
whip
if
i
had
the
upper
hand
i
should
soon
produce
in
the
heads
of
these
people
an
indissoluble
association
of
ideas
between
cracking
a
whip
and
getting
a
whipping
let
us
hope
that
the
more
intelligent
and
refined
among
the
nations
will
make
a
beginning
in
this
matter
and
then
that
the
germans
may
take
example
by
it
and
follow
suit
meanwhile
i
may
quote
what
thomas
hood
says
of
them
a
musical
nation
they
are
the
most
noisy
i
ever
met
that
they
are
so
is
due
to
the
fact
not
that
they
are
more
fond
of
making
a
noise
than
other
people
they
would
deny
it
if
you
asked
them
but
that
their
senses
are
obtuse
consequently
when
they
hear
a
noise
it
does
not
affect
them
much
it
does
not
disturb
them
in
reading
or
thinking
simply
because
they
do
not
think
they
only
smoke
which
is
their
substitute
for
thought
the
general
toleration
of
unnecessary
noise
the
slamming
of
doors
for
instance
a
very
unmannerly
and
thing
is
direct
evidence
that
the
prevailing
habit
of
mind
is
dullness
and
lack
of
thought
in
germany
it
seems
as
though
care
were
taken
that
no
one
should
ever
think
for
mere
noise
to
mention
one
form
of
it
the
way
in
which
drumming
goes
on
for
no
purpose
at
all
footnote
according
to
a
notice
issued
by
the
society
for
the
protection
of
animals
in
munich
the
superfluous
whipping
and
the
cracking
of
whips
were
in
december
positively
forbidden
in
nuremberg
footnote
in
the
finally
as
regards
the
literature
of
the
subject
treated
of
in
this
chapter
i
have
only
one
work
to
recommend
but
it
is
a
good
one
i
refer
to
a
poetical
epistle
in
by
the
famous
painter
bronzino
entitled
romori
a
messer
luca
it
gives
a
detailed
description
of
the
torture
to
which
people
are
put
by
the
various
noises
of
a
small
italian
town
written
in
a
tragicomic
style
it
is
very
amusing
the
epistle
may
be
found
in
burlesche
del
berni
aretino
ed
vol
apparently
published
in
utrecht
in
a
few
parables
in
a
field
of
ripening
corn
i
came
to
a
place
which
had
been
trampled
down
by
some
ruthless
foot
and
as
i
glanced
amongst
the
countless
stalks
every
one
of
them
alike
standing
there
so
erect
and
bearing
the
full
weight
of
the
ear
i
saw
a
multitude
of
different
flowers
red
and
blue
and
violet
how
pretty
they
looked
as
they
grew
there
so
naturally
with
their
little
foliage
but
thought
i
they
are
quite
useless
they
bear
no
fruit
they
are
mere
weeds
suffered
to
remain
only
because
there
is
no
getting
rid
of
them
and
yet
but
for
these
flowers
there
would
be
nothing
to
charm
the
eye
in
that
wilderness
of
stalks
they
are
emblematic
of
poetry
and
art
which
in
civic
life
so
severe
but
still
useful
and
not
without
its
fruit
play
the
same
part
as
flowers
in
the
corn
there
are
some
really
beautifully
landscapes
in
the
world
but
the
human
figures
in
them
are
poor
and
you
had
not
better
look
at
them
the
fly
should
be
used
as
the
symbol
of
impertinence
and
audacity
for
whilst
all
other
animals
shun
man
more
than
anything
else
and
run
away
even
before
he
comes
near
them
the
fly
lights
upon
his
very
nose
two
chinamen
traveling
in
europe
went
to
the
theatre
for
the
first
time
one
of
them
did
nothing
but
study
the
machinery
and
he
succeeded
in
finding
out
how
it
was
worked
the
other
tried
to
get
at
the
meaning
of
the
piece
in
spite
of
his
ignorance
of
the
language
here
you
have
the
astronomer
and
the
philosopher
wisdom
which
is
only
theoretical
and
never
put
into
practice
is
like
a
double
rose
its
color
and
perfume
are
delightful
but
it
withers
away
and
leaves
no
seed
no
rose
without
a
thorn
yes
but
many
a
thorn
without
a
rose
a
stood
in
full
bloom
and
behind
it
a
straight
fir
raised
its
dark
and
tapering
head
at
the
thousands
of
gay
blossoms
which
cover
me
said
the
have
you
to
show
in
comparison
needles
that
is
replied
the
fir
when
winter
comes
you
will
be
bared
of
your
glory
and
i
shall
be
as
i
am
once
as
i
was
botanizing
under
an
oak
i
found
amongst
a
number
of
other
plants
of
similar
height
one
that
was
dark
in
color
with
tightly
closed
leaves
and
a
stalk
that
was
very
straight
and
stiff
when
i
touched
it
it
said
to
me
in
firm
tones
me
alone
i
am
not
for
your
collection
like
these
plants
to
which
nature
has
given
only
a
single
year
of
life
i
am
a
little
so
it
is
with
a
man
whose
influence
is
to
last
for
hundreds
of
years
as
a
child
as
a
youth
often
even
as
a
man
nay
his
whole
life
long
he
goes
about
among
his
fellows
looking
like
them
and
seemingly
as
unimportant
but
let
him
alone
he
will
not
die
time
will
come
and
bring
those
who
know
how
to
value
him
the
man
who
goes
up
in
a
balloon
does
not
feel
as
though
he
were
ascending
he
only
sees
the
earth
sinking
deeper
under
him
there
is
a
mystery
which
only
those
will
understand
who
feel
the
truth
of
it
your
estimation
of
a
man
size
will
be
affected
by
the
distance
at
which
you
stand
from
him
but
in
two
entirely
opposite
ways
according
as
it
is
his
physical
or
his
mental
stature
that
you
are
considering
the
one
will
seem
smaller
the
farther
off
you
move
the
other
greater
nature
covers
all
her
works
with
a
varnish
of
beauty
like
the
tender
bloom
that
is
breathed
as
it
were
on
the
surface
of
a
peach
or
a
plum
painters
and
poets
lay
themselves
out
to
take
off
this
varnish
to
store
it
up
and
give
it
us
to
be
enjoyed
at
our
leisure
we
drink
deep
of
this
beauty
long
before
we
enter
upon
life
itself
and
when
afterwards
we
come
to
see
the
works
of
nature
for
ourselves
the
varnish
is
gone
the
artists
have
used
it
up
and
we
have
enjoyed
it
in
advance
thus
it
is
that
the
world
so
often
appears
harsh
and
devoid
of
charm
nay
actually
repulsive
it
were
better
to
leave
us
to
discover
the
varnish
for
ourselves
this
would
mean
that
we
should
not
enjoy
it
all
at
once
and
in
large
quantities
we
should
have
no
finished
pictures
no
perfect
poems
but
we
should
look
at
all
things
in
that
genial
and
pleasing
light
in
which
even
now
a
child
of
nature
sometimes
sees
them
some
one
who
has
not
anticipated
his
aesthetic
pleasures
by
the
help
of
art
or
taken
the
charms
of
life
too
early
the
cathedral
in
mayence
is
so
shut
in
by
the
houses
that
are
built
round
about
it
that
there
is
no
one
spot
from
which
you
can
see
it
as
a
whole
this
is
symbolic
of
everything
great
or
beautiful
in
the
world
it
ought
to
exist
for
its
own
sake
alone
but
before
very
long
it
is
misused
to
serve
alien
ends
people
come
from
all
directions
wanting
to
find
in
it
support
and
maintenance
for
themselves
they
stand
in
the
way
and
spoil
its
effect
to
be
sure
there
is
nothing
surprising
in
this
for
in
a
world
of
need
and
imperfection
everything
is
seized
upon
which
can
be
used
to
satisfy
want
nothing
is
exempt
from
this
service
no
not
even
those
very
things
which
arise
only
when
need
and
want
are
for
a
moment
lost
sight
of
the
beautiful
and
the
true
sought
for
their
own
sakes
this
is
especially
illustrated
and
corroborated
in
the
case
of
institutions
whether
great
or
small
wealthy
or
poor
founded
no
matter
in
what
century
or
in
what
land
to
maintain
and
advance
human
knowledge
and
generally
to
afford
help
to
those
intellectual
efforts
which
ennoble
the
race
wherever
these
institutions
may
be
it
is
not
long
before
people
sneak
up
to
them
under
the
pretence
of
wishing
to
further
those
special
ends
while
they
are
really
led
on
by
the
desire
to
secure
the
emoluments
which
have
been
left
for
their
furtherance
and
thus
to
satisfy
certain
coarse
and
brutal
instincts
of
their
own
thus
it
is
that
we
come
to
have
so
many
charlatans
in
every
branch
of
knowledge
the
charlatan
takes
very
different
shapes
according
to
circumstances
but
at
bottom
he
is
a
man
who
cares
nothing
about
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
and
only
strives
to
gain
the
semblance
of
it
that
he
may
use
it
for
his
own
personal
ends
which
are
always
selfish
and
material
every
hero
is
a
samson
the
strong
man
succumbs
to
the
intrigues
of
the
weak
and
the
many
and
if
in
the
end
he
loses
all
patience
he
crushes
both
them
and
himself
or
he
is
like
gulliver
at
lilliput
overwhelmed
by
an
enormous
number
of
little
men
a
mother
gave
her
children
aesop
fables
to
read
in
the
hope
of
educating
and
improving
their
minds
but
they
very
soon
brought
the
book
back
and
the
eldest
wise
beyond
his
years
delivered
himself
as
follows
is
no
book
for
us
it
much
too
childish
and
stupid
you
ca
make
us
believe
that
foxes
and
wolves
and
ravens
are
able
to
talk
we
got
beyond
stories
of
that
in
these
young
hopefuls
you
have
the
enlightened
rationalists
of
the
future
a
number
of
porcupines
huddled
together
for
warmth
on
a
cold
day
in
winter
but
as
they
began
to
prick
one
another
with
their
quills
they
were
obliged
to
disperse
however
the
cold
drove
them
together
again
when
just
the
same
thing
happened
at
last
after
many
turns
of
huddling
and
dispersing
they
discovered
that
they
would
be
best
off
by
remaining
at
a
little
distance
from
one
another
in
the
same
way
the
need
of
society
drives
the
human
porcupines
together
only
to
be
mutually
repelled
by
the
many
prickly
and
disagreeable
qualities
of
their
nature
the
moderate
distance
which
they
at
last
discover
to
be
the
only
tolerable
condition
of
intercourse
is
the
code
of
politeness
and
fine
manners
and
those
who
transgress
it
are
roughly
told
in
the
english
phrase
keep
their
by
this
arrangement
the
mutual
need
of
warmth
is
only
very
moderately
satisfied
but
then
people
do
not
get
pricked
a
man
who
has
some
heat
in
himself
prefers
to
remain
outside
where
he
will
neither
prick
other
people
nor
get
pricked
himself
