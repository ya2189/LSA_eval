good
food
depends
as
largely
upon
the
judgment
of
the
cook
as
upon
the
materials
used
these
recipes
and
household
hints
are
written
very
plainly
for
those
who
have
had
no
experience
no

and
possibly
have
little

are
very
simple
not
expensive
and
if

it
is
the

introduction
the

mother
used
to
make
consist
of
old
fashioned
recipes
which
have
been
for
the
most
part
handed
down
by
word
of
mouth
from
one
generation
to
another
extending
over
a
period
of
nearly
one
hundred
years
the
author
a
new
england
woman
has
during
her
life
tested
out
in
her
own
kitchen
the
greater
part
of
these
recipes
which
represent
the
best
cookery
of
those
times
this
material
was
originally
published
in
where
it
obtained
such
recognition
as
seemed
to
warrant
its
preservation
in
book
form
the
original
material
has
accordingly
been
amplified
and

you
will
be

with
the

i
have
tried
this
for
forty
years
to
prevent
button
holes
from

holes
in

or
any
material
which
frays
place
a
piece
of
lawn
of
two
thicknesses
underneath
and
work
through
this
another
way
is
to
make
four
stitchings
in
the
goods
the
length
of
the
button
hole
cut
between
these
leaving
two
stitchings
each

of
the

making
a
silk
stitch
a
crescent
shaped
piece
of
the

material
as
your

under

it
will
wear
longer
and
when
the
outside
wears
out
it
looks
neater
than
a
patch
if
the
waist
is
lined
put
this
between
the
lining
and
the
outside
make

look
turn
hot

up
rest
these
on
two
pieces
of

or
hold
in

put
over
them
a
piece
of
wet
cloth
then
lay
the
velvet
on
this
brush
with
a
whisk
broom
the
steam
from
the
wet
cloth
will
raise
the
nap
and
take
out
the

skins
as
a
if
you
wish
for
a
bright
yellow
save
your
onion
skins
they
will
color
white

a
very
bright

this
is
a
good
color
for
braided

such
as
people
used
to
make

when
applied
dry
with

better
than

because
of
the

not
allow
a

this
often
looks
clean
and
pure
but
fill
a

then
show
