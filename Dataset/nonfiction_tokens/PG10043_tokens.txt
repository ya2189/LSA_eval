preface
the
extraordinary
excitement
arising
from
the
reports
of
the
discovery
of
gold
in
the
klondyke
region
in
the
great
canadian
northwest
is
not
surprising
to
one
who
through
personal
residence
and
practical
experience
is
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
locality
having
recently
returned
for
a
temporary
stay
after
a
somewhat
successful
experience
i
have
received
applications
for
information
in
numbers
so
great
that
it
far
exceeds
my
ability
and
the
time
at
my
disposal
to
make
direct
replies
i
have
therefore
arranged
with
the
american
technical
book
vesey
street
new
york
city
for
the
issue
of
this
brief
description
preparatory
to
the
publication
of
my
larger
book
klondyke
facts
a
book
of
pages
with
illustrations
and
maps
in
which
will
be
found
a
vast
fund
of
practical
information
statistics
and
all
particulars
sought
for
by
those
who
intend
emigrating
to
this
wonderful
country
it
is
impossible
to
tell
the
truth
of
these
recent
discoveries
of
gold
but
while
i
can
only
briefly
describe
the
territory
in
this
small
work
it
shall
be
my
endeavor
to
give
the
intending
prospector
in
the
large
work
above
mentioned
as
many
facts
as
possible
and
these
may
thoroughly
be
relied
upon
as
from
one
who
has
lived
continuously
in
those
regions
since
joseph

chapter
klondyke
klondyke
the
word
and
place
that
has
startled
the
civilized
world
is
a
series
of
thriving
mining
camps
on
the
yukon
river
and
its
tributaries
in
the
canadian
northwest
territories
prior
to
august
this
section
of
the
country
had
never
been
heard
of
it
was
on
this
day
that
a
man
named
henderson
discovered
the
first
gold
on
the
first
day
of
the
following
month
the
writer
commenced
erecting
the
first
house
in
this
region
and
called
the
place
dawson
city
now
the
central
point
of
the
mining
camps
dawson
city
is
now
the
most
important
point
in
the
new
mining
regions
its
population
in
june
exceeded
by
june
next
it
can
not
be
less
than
it
has
a
stores
churches
of
the
presbyterian
baptist
methodist
and
roman
catholic
denominations
it
is
the
headquarters
of
the
canadian
northwest
mounted
police
perfect
law
and
order
is
it
is
at
dawson
city
that
the
prospector
files
his
claims
with
the
government
gold
commissioner
in
the
recording
offices
dawson
city
faces
on
one
of
the
banks
of
the
yukon
river
and
now
occupies
about
a
mile
of
the
bank
it
is
at
the
junction
of
the
klondyke
river
with
the
yukon
river
it
is
here
where
the
most
valuable
mining
claims
are
being
operated
on
a
scale
of
profit
that
the
world
has
hitherto
never
known
the
entire
country
surrounding
is
teeming
with
mineral
wealth
copper
silver
and
coal
can
be
found
in
large
quantities
but
little
or
no
attention
is
now
being
paid
to
these
valuable
minerals
as
every
one
is
engaged
in
and
working
the
extraordinary
placer
mining
claims
already
located
the
entire
section
is
given
up
to
placer
mining
very
few
claims
had
been
filed
for
quartz
mining
the
fields
of
gold
will
not
be
exhausted
in
the
near
future
no
man
can
tell
what
the
end
will
be
from
january
to
april
about
were
taken
out
of
the
few
placer
claims
then
being
worked
this
was
done
in
a
territory
not
exceeding
forty
square
miles
all
these
claims
are
located
on
klondyke
river
and
the
little
tributaries
emptying
into
it
and
the
districts
are
known
as
big
bonanza
gold
bottom
and
honker
i
have
asked
old
and
experienced
miners
at
dawson
city
who
mined
through
california
in
bonanza
days
and
some
who
mined
in
australia
what
they
thought
of
the
klondyke
region
and
their
reply
has
invariably
been
the
world
never
saw
so
vast
and
rich
a
find
of
gold
as
we
are
working
now
dawson
city
is
destined
to
be
the
greatest
mining
camp
in
the
history
of
mining
operations
chapter
ii
klondyke
facts
there
is
a
great
popular
error
in
reference
to
the
climate
of
the
gold
regions
many
reports
have
appeared
in
the
newspapers
which
are
misleading
it
has
been
even
stated
that
the
cold
is
excessive
almost
throughout
the
year
this
is
entirely
a
i
have
found
i
have
suffered
more
from
winter
cold
in
northern
new
york
than
i
ever
did
in
alaska
or
the
canadian
northwest
i
have
chopped
wood
in
my
in
front
of
my
door
at
dawson
city
when
the
thermometer
was
degrees
below
zero
and
i
suffered
no
inconvenience
we
account
for
this
from
the
fact
that
the
air
is
very
dry
it
is
a
fact
that
you
do
not
feel
this
low
temperature
as
much
as
you
would
below
zero
in
the
east
we
usually
have
about
three
feet
of
snow
in
winter
and
it
is
as
dry
as
sawdust
as
we
have
no
winter
thaws
no
crust
forms
on
the
snow
therefore
we
travel
from
the
various
points
that
may
be
necessary
with
snowshoes
these
may
be
purchased
from
the
indians
in
the
vicinity
of
dawson
city
at
from
to
per
pair
according
to
the
quality
the
winter
days
are
very
short
in
this
region
there
are
only
two
hours
from
sunrise
to
sunset
the
sun
rises
and
sets
away
in
the
south
but
there
is
no
pitch
darkness
the
twilight
lasts
all
night
and
the
northern
lights
are
very
common
then
in
summer
it
is
exactly
the
other
way
the
day
there
in
july
is
about
twenty
hours
long
the
sun
rising
and
setting
in
the
north
a
great
deal
has
been
said
about
the
short
seasons
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
miner
can
work
months
in
the
year
when
in
that
region
spring
opens
about
may
and
the
ice
commences
to
break
up
about
that
time
the
yukon
river
is
generally
clear
of
ice
about
may
the
best
part
of
the
miner
work
commences
then
and
lasts
till
about
october
the
winter
commences
in
october
but
the
miner
keeps
on
working
through
the
winter
the
rainy
season
commences
in
the
latter
part
of
august
and
lasts
two
or
three
weeks
a
fall
of
two
feet
of
snow
is
considered
heavy
there
is
a
wide
difference
in
the
quantity
of
snow
that
accumulates
on
the
coast
and
the
ranges
in
the
interior
where
the
principal
mining
claims
are
located
while
the
fall
of
snow
on
the
coast
is
heavy
the
depth
of
snow
as
far
down
as
the
yukon
stewart
and
klondyke
rivers
is
inconsiderable
in
my
new
work
on
this
territory
entitled
klondyke
facts
i
deal
more
largely
on
the
climate
of
this
region
there
are
still
good
diggings
at
circle
city
in
alaska
but
nearly
all
the
miners
have
left
for
klondyke
not
being
satisfied
with
the
pay
dirt
which
they
were
working
i
know
at
least
good
claims
in
circle
city
fort
cudahy
or
as
it
is
sometimes
called
forty
mile
creek
is
now
practically
exhausted
as
a
mining
camp
and
the
miners
have
left
for
other
diggings
there
will
undoubtedly
be
new
and
valuable
diggings
discovered
very
quickly
along
this
region
as
it
is
certain
that
this
enormous
territory
is
rich
in
districts
the
entire
country
is
teeming
with
mineral
wealth
when
mining
operations
commence
on
coal
it
will
be
specially
valuable
for
steamers
on
the
various
rivers
and
greatly
assist
transportation
facilities
in
the
next
few
years
there
will
certainly
be
recorded
the
most
marvellous
discoveries
in
this
territory
usually
thought
to
be
only
a
land
of
snow
and
ice
and
fit
only
to
be
classed
with
the
arctic
regions
it
is
marvellous
to
state
that
for
some
years
past
we
have
been
finding
gold
in
occasional
places
in
this
territory
but
from
the
poverty
of
the
people
no
effort
was
made
to
prospect
among
the
places
reported
it
is
my
belief
that
the
greatest
finds
of
gold
will
be
made
in
this
territory
it
is
safe
to
say
that
not
per
cent
of
all
the
gold
discovered
so
far
has
been
on
united
states
soil
the
great
mass
of
the
work
has
been
done
on
the
northwest
territory
which
is
under
the
canadian
government
it
is
possible
however
that
further
discoveries
will
be
made
on
american
soil
but
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
most
valuable
discoveries
will
be
further
east
and
south
of
the
present
claims
and
would
advise
prospectors
to
work
east
and
south
of
klondyke
the
yukon
river
and
its
tributaries
what
the
amazon
is
to
south
america
the
mississippi
to
the
central
portion
of
the
united
states
the
yukon
is
to
alaska
it
is
a
great
inland
highway
which
will
make
it
possible
for
the
explorer
to
penetrate
the
mysterious
fastnesses
of
that
still
unknown
region
the
yukon
has
its
source
in
the
rocky
mountains
of
british
columbia
and
the
coast
range
mountains
in
southeastern
alaska
about
miles
from
the
city
of
juneau
which
is
the
present
metropolis
of
alaska
but
it
is
only
known
as
the
yukon
river
at
the
point
where
the
pelly
river
the
branch
that
heads
in
british
columbia
meets
with
the
lewes
river
which
heads
in
southeastern
alaska
this
point
of
confluence
is
at
fort
selkirk
in
the
northwest
territory
about
miles
of
the
klondyke
the
yukon
proper
is
miles
in
length
from
fort
selkirk
it
flows
miles
just
touching
the
arctic
circle
thence
southward
for
a
distance
of
miles
where
it
empties
into
behring
sea
it
drains
more
than
square
miles
of
territory
and
discharges
more
water
into
behring
sea
than
does
the
mississippi
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
at
its
mouth
it
is
sixty
miles
wide
about
miles
inland
it
widens
out
from
one
to
ten
miles
a
thousand
islands
send
the
channel
in
as
many
different
directions
only
natives
who
are
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
river
are
entrusted
with
the
piloting
of
boats
up
the
stream
during
the
season
of
low
water
even
at
the
season
of
high
water
it
is
still
so
shallow
as
not
to
be
navigable
anywhere
by
seagoing
vessels
but
only
by
boats
with
a
carrying
capacity
of
four
to
five
hundred
tons
the
draft
of
steamers
on
the
yukon
should
not
exceed
three
and
a
half
feet
the
yukon
district
which
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
canadian
government
and
in
which
the
bulk
of
the
gold
has
been
found
has
a
total
area
approximately
of
square
miles
of
which
square
miles
are
included
in
the
watershed
of
the
yukon
illustrating
this
so
that
it
may
appeal
with
definiteness
to
the
reader
it
may
be
said
that
this
territory
is
greater
by
square
miles
than
the
area
of
great
britain
and
is
nearly
three
times
that
of
all
the
new
england
states
combined
a
further
fact
must
be
borne
in
mind
the
yukon
river
is
absolutely
closed
to
navigation
during
the
winter
months
in
the
winter
the
asserts
his
dominion
and
locks
up
all
approaches
with
impenetrable
ice
and
the
summer
is
of
the
briefest
it
endures
only
for
twelve
to
fourteen
weeks
from
about
the
first
of
june
to
the
middle
of
september
then
an
unending
panorama
of
extraordinary
picturesqueness
is
unfolded
to
the
voyager
the
banks
are
fringed
with
flowers
carpeted
with
the
moss
or
tundra
birds
countless
in
numbers
and
of
infinite
variety
in
plumage
sing
out
a
welcome
from
every
treetop
pitch
your
tent
where
you
will
in
midsummer
a
bed
of
roses
a
clump
of
poppies
and
a
bunch
of
bluebells
will
adorn
your
camping
but
high
above
this
paradise
of
almost
tropical
exuberance
giant
glaciers
sleep
in
the
summit
of
the
mountain
wall
which
rises
up
from
a
bed
of
roses
by
september
everything
is
changed
the
bed
of
roses
has
disappeared
before
the
icy
breath
of
the
winter
king
which
sends
the
thermometer
down
sometimes
to
seventy
degrees
below
freezing
point
the
birds
fly
to
the
southland
and
the
bear
to
his
sleeping
chamber
in
the
mountains
every
stream
becomes
a
sheet
of
ice
mountain
and
valley
alike
are
covered
with
snow
till
the
following
may
that
part
of
the
basin
of
the
yukon
in
which
gold
in
greater
or
less
quantities
has
actually
been
found
lies
partly
in
alaska
and
partly
in
british
territory
it
covers
an
area
of
some
square
miles
but
so
far
the
infinitely
richest
spot
lies
some
one
hundred
miles
east
of
the
american
boundary
in
the
region
drained
by
the
klondyke
and
its
tributaries
this
is
some
three
hundred
miles
by
river
from
circle
city
we
have
described
some
of
the
beauties
of
the
yukon
basin
in
the
summer
season
but
this
radiant
picture
has
its
obverse
side
horseflies
gnats
and
mosquitoes
add
to
the
joys
of
living
throughout
the
entire
length
of
the
yukon
valley
the
horsefly
is
larger
and
more
poignantly
assertive
than
the
insect
which
we
know
by
that
name
in
dressing
or
undressing
it
has
a
pleasant
habit
of
detecting
any
bare
spot
in
the
body
and
biting
out
a
piece
of
flesh
leaving
a
wound
which
a
few
days
later
looks
like
an
incipient
boil
schwatka
reports
that
one
of
his
party
so
bitten
was
completely
disabled
for
a
week
the
moment
of
infliction
he
adds
was
hard
to
believe
that
one
was
not
disabled
for
life
the
mosquitoes
according
to
the
same
authority
are
equally
distressing
they
are
especially
fond
of
cattle
but
without
any
reciprocity
of
affection
to
the
general
terms
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
and
the
growth
of
muscles
most
used
to
the
detriment
of
others
says
the
lieutenant
in
an
unusual
burst
of
humor
band
of
cattle
inhabiting
this
district
in
the
far
future
would
be
all
tail
and
no
body
unless
the
mosquitoes
should
experience
a
change
of
numbers
i
am
indebted
to
wm
ogilvie
for
the
following
valuable
information
relative
to
the
yukon
district
the
yukon
district
comprises
speaking
generally
that
part
of
the
northwest
territories
lying
west
of
the
water
shed
of
the
mackenzie
river
most
of
it
is
drained
by
the
yukon
river
and
its
tributaries
it
covers
a
distance
of
about
miles
along
the
river
from
the
coast
range
of
mountains
in
campbell
established
fort
selkirk
at
the
confluence
of
the
pelly
and
lewes
rivers
it
was
plundered
and
destroyed
in
by
the
coast
indians
and
only
the
ruins
now
exist
of
what
was
at
one
time
the
most
important
post
of
the
hudson
bay
company
to
the
west
of
the
rocky
mountains
in
the
far
north
in
the
hudson
bay
company
officer
was
expelled
from
fort
yukon
by
the
united
states
government
they
haying
ascertained
by
astronomical
observations
that
the
post
was
not
located
in
british
territory
the
officer
thereupon
ascended
the
porcupine
to
a
point
which
was
supposed
to
be
within
british
jurisdiction
where
he
established
rampart
house
but
in
turner
of
the
united
states
coast
survey
found
it
to
be
miles
within
the
lines
of
the
united
states
consequently
in
the
post
was
moved
miles
further
up
the
river
to
be
within
british
territory
the
next
people
to
enter
the
country
for
trading
purposes
were
harper
and
mcquestion
they
have
been
trading
in
the
country
since
and
have
occupied
numerous
posts
all
along
the
river
the
greater
number
of
which
have
been
abandoned
harper
is
now
located
as
a
trader
at
fort
selkirk
with
joseph
ladue
under
the
firm
name
of
harper
ladue
and
mcquestion
is
in
the
employ
of
the
alaska
commercial
company
at
circle
city
which
is
the
distributing
point
for
the
vast
regions
surrounding
birch
creek
alaska
in
a
number
of
miners
entered
the
yukon
country
by
the
taiya
pass
it
is
still
the
only
route
used
to
any
extent
by
the
miners
and
is
shorter
than
the
other
passes
though
not
the
lowest
in
lieutenant
schwatka
crossed
this
same
pass
and
descended
the
lewes
and
yukon
rivers
to
the
ocean
the
explorers
found
that
in
proximity
to
the
boundary
line
there
existed
extensive
and
valuable
placer
gold
mines
in
which
even
then
as
many
as
three
hundred
miners
were
at
work
ogilvie
determined
by
a
series
of
lunar
observations
the
point
at
which
the
yukon
river
is
intersected
by
the
meridian
and
marked
the
same
on
the
ground
he
also
determined
and
marked
the
point
at
which
the
western
affluent
of
the
yukon
known
as
forty
mile
creek
is
crossed
by
the
same
meridian
line
that
point
being
situated
at
a
distance
of
about
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
creek
this
survey
proved
that
the
place
which
had
been
selected
as
the
most
convenient
owing
to
the
physical
conformation
of
the
region
from
which
to
distribute
the
supplies
imported
for
the
various
mining
camps
and
from
which
to
conduct
the
other
business
incident
to
the
mining
operations
a
place
situate
at
the
confluence
of
the
forty
mile
creek
and
the
yukon
and
to
which
the
name
of
fort
cudahy
has
been
given
is
well
within
canadian
territory
the
greater
proportion
of
the
mines
then
being
worked
ogilvie
found
to
be
on
the
canadian
side
of
the
international
boundary
line
but
he
reported
the
existence
of
some
mining
fields
to
the
south
the
exact
position
of
which
with
respect
to
the
boundary
he
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
fix
the
number
of
persons
engaged
in
mining
in
the
locality
mentioned
has
steadily
increased
year
by
year
since
the
date
of
ogilvie
survey
and
it
is
estimated
that
at
the
commencement
of
the
past
season
not
less
than
one
thousand
men
were
so
employed
incident
to
this
mineral
development
there
must
follow
a
corresponding
growth
in
the
volume
of
business
of
all
descriptions
particularly
the
importation
of
dutiable
goods
and
the
occupation
of
tracts
of
the
public
lands
for
mining
purposes
which
according
to
the
mining
regulations
are
subject
to
the
payment
of
certain
prescribed
dues
and
charges
the
alaska
commercial
company
for
many
years
subsequent
to
the
retirement
of
the
hudson
bay
company
had
a
practical
monopoly
of
the
trade
of
the
yukon
carrying
into
the
country
and
delivering
at
various
points
along
the
river
without
regard
to
the
international
boundary
line
or
the
customs
laws
and
regulations
of
canada
such
articles
of
commerce
as
were
required
for
the
prosecution
of
the
fur
trade
and
latterly
of
placer
mining
these
being
the
only
two
existing
industries
with
the
discovery
of
gold
however
came
the
organization
of
a
competing
company
known
as
the
north
american
transportation
and
trading
company
having
its
headquarters
in
chicago
and
its
chief
trading
and
distributing
post
at
cudahy
this
company
has
been
engaged
in
this
trade
for
over
three
years
and
during
the
past
season
despatched
two
ocean
steamers
from
san
francisco
to
michael
at
the
mouth
of
the
yukon
the
merchandise
from
which
was
at
the
last
mentioned
point
transhipped
into
river
steamers
and
carried
to
points
inland
but
chiefly
to
the
distributing
centre
within
canadian
territory
importations
of
considerable
value
consisting
of
the
immediately
requisite
supplies
of
the
miners
and
their
tools
also
reach
the
canadian
portion
of
the
yukon
district
from
juneau
in
the
united
states
by
way
of
the
taiya
inlet
the
mountain
passes
and
the
chain
of
waterways
leading
therefrom
to
cudahy
upon
none
of
these
importations
had
any
duty
been
collected
except
a
sum
of
paid
to
inspector
constantine
in
by
the
north
american
transportation
and
trading
company
and
others
and
it
is
safe
to
conclude
especially
when
it
is
remembered
that
the
country
produces
none
of
the
articles
consumed
within
it
except
fresh
meat
that
a
large
revenue
was
being
lost
to
the
public
exchequer
under
the
then
existing
conditions
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
officially
and
authoritatively
the
condition
of
affairs
to
which
the
correspondence
referred
to
in
the
next
preceding
paragraph
relates
the
honorable
the
president
of
the
privy
council
during
the
spring
of
despatched
inspector
charles
constantine
of
the
northwest
mounted
police
force
accompanied
by
sergeant
brown
to
fort
cudahy
and
the
mining
camps
in
its
vicinity
the
report
made
by
constantine
on
his
return
established
the
substantial
accuracy
of
the
representations
already
referred
to
the
value
of
the
total
output
of
gold
for
the
season
of
he
estimated
at
the
facts
recited
clearly
establish
first
that
the
time
had
arrived
when
it
became
the
duty
of
the
government
of
canada
to
make
more
efficient
provision
for
the
maintenance
of
order
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
and
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
yukon
country
especially
in
that
section
of
it
in
which
placer
mining
for
gold
is
being
prosecuted
upon
such
an
extensive
scale
situated
near
to
the
boundary
separating
the
northwest
territories
from
the
possessions
of
the
united
states
in
alaska
and
second
that
while
such
measures
as
were
necessary
to
that
end
were
called
for
in
the
interests
of
humanity
and
particularly
for
the
security
and
safety
of
the
lives
and
property
of
the
canadian
subjects
of
her
majesty
resident
in
that
country
who
are
engaged
in
legitimate
business
pursuits
it
was
evident
that
the
revenue
justly
due
to
the
government
of
canada
under
its
customs
excise
and
land
laws
and
which
would
go
a
long
way
to
pay
the
expenses
of
government
was
being
lost
for
the
want
of
adequate
machinery
for
its
collection
accordingly
in
june
last
a
detachment
of
twenty
members
of
the
mounted
police
force
including
officers
was
detailed
for
service
in
that
portion
of
the
northwest
territories
the
officer
in
command
in
addition
to
the
magisterial
and
other
duties
he
is
required
to
perform
by
virtue
of
his
office
and
under
instructions
from
the
department
of
mounted
police
was
duly
authorized
to
represent
where
necessary
and
until
other
arrangements
can
be
made
all
the
departments
of
the
government
having
interests
in
that
region
particularly
he
is
authorized
to
perform
the
duties
of
dominion
lands
agent
collector
of
customs
and
collector
of
inland
revenue
at
the
same
time
instructions
were
given
william
ogilvie
the
surveyor
referred
to
as
having
with
dawson
been
entrusted
with
the
conduct
of
the
first
government
expedition
to
the
yukon
to
proceed
again
to
that
district
for
the
purpose
of
continuing
and
extending
the
work
of
determining
the
meridian
of
laying
out
building
lots
and
mining
claims
and
generally
of
performing
such
duties
as
may
be
entrusted
to
him
from
time
to
time
ogilvie
qualifications
as
a
surveyor
and
his
previous
experience
as
explorer
of
this
section
of
the
northwest
peculiarly
fit
him
for
the
task
footnote
the
detachment
was
made
up
as
follows
inspector
constantine
officer
commanding
yukon
detachment
police
inspector
strickland
assistant
surgeon
wills
staff
sergeants
corporals
constables
as
it
appears
quite
certain
from
the
report
made
by
ogilvie
on
his
return
to
ottawa
in
and
from
the
report
of
constantine
that
the
operations
of
the
miners
are
being
conducted
upon
streams
which
have
their
sources
in
the
united
states
territory
of
alaska
and
flow
into
canada
on
their
way
to
join
the
yukon
and
as
doubtless
some
of
the
placer
diggings
under
development
are
situated
on
the
united
states
side
of
the
boundary
it
is
highly
desirable
both
for
the
purpose
of
settling
definitely
to
which
country
any
land
occupied
for
mining
or
other
purposes
actually
belongs
and
in
order
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
and
officers
of
the
united
states
and
canada
for
both
civil
and
criminal
purposes
may
be
established
that
the
determination
of
the
meridian
west
of
greenwich
from
the
point
of
its
intersection
with
the
yukon
as
marked
by
ogilvie
in
for
a
considerable
distance
south
of
the
river
and
possibly
also
for
some
distance
to
the
north
should
be
proceeded
with
at
once
ogilvie
instructions
require
him
to
go
on
with
the
survey
with
all
convenient
speed
but
in
order
that
this
work
may
be
effective
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
object
in
view
the
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
necessary
correspondence
is
in
progress
through
the
proper
authorities
with
a
view
to
obtaining
this
it
may
be
mentioned
that
a
united
states
surveyor
has
also
determined
the
points
at
which
the
yukon
river
and
forty
mile
creek
are
intersected
by
the
meridian
routes
distances
and
transportation
after
considerable
experience
i
have
decided
that
the
best
route
for
a
man
to
take
to
the
gold
regions
is
from
seattle
washington
to
juneau
alaska
and
then
to
dawson
city
by
the
pass
and
waterways
and
i
will
therefore
describe
this
route
more
in
detail
than
any
of
the
others
i
am
devoting
a
special
chapter
to
the
outfit
for
travellers
and
will
therefore
deal
in
this
chapter
with
the
route
only
the
traveller
having
paid
his
fare
to
seattle
should
on
arrival
there
have
not
less
than
this
is
the
minimum
sum
necessary
to
pay
his
fare
from
seattle
to
juneau
purchase
his
outfit
and
supplies
for
one
year
and
pay
his
necessary
expenses
in
the
gold
region
for
that
length
of
time
i
think
it
deplorable
that
so
many
are
starting
at
this
time
for
the
i
do
not
recommend
starting
before
march
i
will
return
at
that
time
to
my
claims
on
the
klondyke
if
it
were
wise
to
go
sooner
i
should
certainly
go
the
reason
march
is
best
is
that
the
season
is
better
then
if
a
man
has
only
say
and
wants
to
do
his
own
packing
over
the
taiya
pass
it
gives
him
time
to
do
it
by
starting
march
as
he
will
then
be
in
juneau
april
i
fear
a
great
deal
of
hardship
for
those
who
started
out
so
as
to
reach
juneau
for
winter
travel
of
course
while
i
say
is
sufficient
to
go
to
dawson
city
a
man
should
take
or
even
more
if
possible
as
he
will
have
many
opportunities
to
invest
the
surplus
while
prices
will
undoubtedly
advance
at
dawson
city
owing
to
the
large
influx
of
people
i
do
not
think
the
advance
will
be
excessive
it
has
never
been
the
policy
of
the
two
trading
companies
to
take
advantage
of
the
miners
the
traveller
having
arrived
in
juneau
from
seattle
a
journey
of
miles
by
water
immediately
purchases
his
complete
outfit
as
described
in
another
chapter
he
then
loses
no
time
in
leaving
juneau
for
dyea
taking
a
small
steamboat
which
runs
regularly
to
this
port
via
the
lynn
canal
dyea
has
recently
been
made
a
customs
port
of
entry
and
the
head
of
navigation
this
side
of
the
taiya
pass
the
distance
between
juneau
and
dyea
is
about
one
hundred
miles
from
dyea
which
is
the
he
packs
his
outfit
to
the
foot
of
the
taiya
pass
the
length
of
which
to
the
summit
is
about
miles
he
must
now
carry
his
outfit
up
the
pass
which
he
generally
does
in
two
or
more
trips
according
to
the
weight
of
his
outfit
unless
he
is
able
to
hire
indians
or
mules
but
so
far
there
are
very
few
indians
to
be
hired
and
still
fewer
mules
he
now
starts
for
lake
lindeman
from
the
head
of
the
pass
a
distance
of
eight
miles
the
distance
from
dyea
to
lake
lindeman
being
miles
at
lake
lindeman
he
commences
to
make
his
boat
for
which
he
has
brought
the
proper
supplies
in
his
outfit
with
the
exception
of
the
timber
which
he
finds
at
lake
lindeman
he
spends
one
week
at
lake
lindeman
making
his
boat
and
getting
ready
for
the
long
trip
down
the
waterways
to
dawson
city
the
heart
of
the
klondyke
region
the
trip
through
lake
lindeman
is
short
the
lake
being
only
five
miles
long
at
the
foot
of
the
lake
he
must
portage
to
lake
bennet
the
portage
however
being
very
short
less
than
a
mile
lake
bennet
is
miles
long
while
going
through
this
lake
the
traveller
crosses
the
boundary
between
british
columbia
and
the
northwest
territory
after
going
down
lake
bennet
the
traveller
comes
to
caribou
crossing
about
four
miles
long
which
takes
him
to
lake
tagish
twenty
miles
in
length
after
leaving
tagish
he
finds
himself
in
mud
or
marsh
lake
miles
long
then
into
the
lynx
river
on
which
he
continues
for
miles
till
he
comes
to
miles
canyon
of
a
mile
long
immediately
on
leaving
miles
canyon
he
has
three
miles
of
what
is
called
bad
river
work
which
while
not
hazardous
is
dangerous
from
the
swift
current
and
from
being
very
rocky
great
care
has
to
be
taken
in
going
down
this
part
of
the
river
he
now
finds
himself
in
white
horse
canyon
the
rapids
of
which
are
of
a
mile
in
length
and
one
of
the
most
dangerous
places
on
the
trip
a
man
is
here
guarded
by
a
sign
keep
a
good
lookout
no
stranger
or
novice
should
try
to
run
the
white
horse
rapids
alone
in
a
boat
he
should
let
his
boat
drop
down
the
river
guided
by
a
rope
with
which
he
has
provided
himself
in
his
outfit
and
which
should
be
feet
long
it
would
be
better
if
the
traveller
should
portage
here
the
miners
having
constructed
a
portage
road
on
the
west
side
and
put
down
in
some
places
on
which
they
roll
their
boats
over
they
have
also
made
some
windlasses
with
which
they
haul
their
boat
up
the
hill
till
they
are
at
the
foot
of
the
canyon
the
white
horse
canyon
is
very
rocky
and
dangerous
and
the
current
extremely
swift
after
leaving
the
white
horse
canyon
he
goes
down
the
river
to
the
head
of
lake
labarge
a
distance
of
miles
he
can
sit
down
and
steer
with
the
current
as
he
is
going
down
the
stream
all
the
way
it
is
for
this
reason
that
in
returning
from
the
diggings
he
should
take
another
route
of
which
he
will
get
full
particulars
before
leaving
dawson
therefore
i
do
not
take
the
time
to
give
a
full
description
of
the
return
trip
via
the
yukon
to
michael
he
now
goes
through
lake
labarge
for
miles
till
he
strikes
the
lewes
river
this
taking
him
down
to
hootalinqua
he
is
now
in
the
lewes
river
which
takes
him
for
miles
to
big
salmon
river
and
from
big
salmon
river
miles
to
little
salmon
river
the
current
all
this
time
taking
him
down
at
the
rate
of
five
miles
an
hour
of
course
in
the
canyons
it
is
very
much
swifter
the
little
salmon
river
takes
him
to
five
finger
rapids
a
distance
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
in
the
five
finger
rapids
the
voyage
should
be
made
on
the
right
side
of
the
river
going
with
the
current
these
rapids
are
considered
safe
by
careful
management
but
the
novice
will
already
have
had
sufficient
experience
in
guiding
his
boat
before
reaching
them
from
five
finger
rapids
the
traveller
goes
six
miles
below
down
the
lewes
to
the
rink
rapids
on
going
through
the
rink
rapids
he
continues
on
the
lewes
river
to
fort
selkirk
the
trading
post
of
harper
and
ladue
where
the
pelly
and
lewes
at
their
junction
form
the
headwaters
of
the
yukon
you
are
now
at
the
head
of
the
yukon
river
and
the
worst
part
of
your
trip
is
over
you
now
commence
to
go
down
the
yukon
and
after
a
trip
of
miles
you
are
in
the
white
river
you
keep
on
the
white
river
for
ten
miles
to
the
stewart
river
and
then
miles
to
fort
ogilvie
you
are
now
only
forty
miles
from
dawson
city
your
journey
is
now
almost
ended
after
a
trip
on
the
yukon
you
arrive
at
dawson
city
where
the
klondyke
empties
in
the
yukon
all
through
this
trip
you
have
been
going
through
a
mountainous
country
the
trees
there
being
pine
a
small
amount
of
spruce
cottonwood
and
birch
you
have
not
seen
much
game
if
any
as
it
is
growing
scarce
along
that
line
of
river
and
very
hard
to
find
the
traveller
had
therefore
better
make
preparation
to
depend
on
the
provisions
he
has
brought
with
him
if
he
has
stopped
to
fish
he
may
have
been
successful
in
catching
whitefish
grayling
and
lake
trout
along
the
lakes
and
rivers
the
total
journey
from
seattle
to
dawson
city
has
taken
about
two
months
in
connection
with
this
trip
from
juneau
to
dawson
city
it
is
perhaps
better
to
give
the
reader
the
benefit
of
the
trip
of
william
stewart
who
writes
from
lake
lindeman
may
as
follows
we
arrived
here
at
the
south
end
of
the
lake
last
night
by
boat
we
have
had
an
awful
time
of
it
the
taiya
pass
is
not
a
pass
at
all
but
a
climb
right
over
the
mountains
we
left
juneau
on
thursday
the
twentieth
on
a
little
boat
smaller
than
the
ferry
at
ottawa
there
were
over
sixty
aboard
all
in
one
room
about
ten
by
fourteen
there
was
baggage
piled
up
in
one
end
so
that
the
was
only
about
eight
by
eight
we
went
aboard
about
three
in
the
afternoon
and
went
ashore
at
dyea
at
seven
friday
night
we
got
the
indians
to
pack
all
our
stuff
up
to
the
summit
but
about
fifty
pounds
each
i
had
pounds
and
my
gun
we
left
dyea
an
indian
village
sunday
but
only
got
up
the
river
one
mile
we
towed
all
the
stuff
up
the
river
seven
miles
and
then
packed
it
to
sheep
camp
we
reached
sheep
camp
about
seven
at
night
on
the
queen
birthday
a
beautiful
time
we
had
i
can
tell
you
climbing
hills
with
fifty
pounds
on
our
backs
it
would
not
be
so
bad
if
we
could
strap
it
on
rightly
we
left
sheep
camp
next
morning
at
four
and
reached
the
summit
at
seven
it
was
an
awful
climb
an
angle
of
about
degrees
we
could
keep
our
hands
touching
the
trail
all
the
way
up
it
was
blowing
and
snowing
up
there
we
paid
off
the
indians
and
got
some
sleighs
and
sleighed
the
stuff
down
the
hill
this
hill
goes
down
pretty
swift
and
then
drops
at
an
angle
of
degrees
for
about
forty
feet
and
we
had
to
our
sleighs
and
let
them
go
there
was
an
awful
fog
and
we
could
not
see
where
we
were
going
some
fellows
helped
us
down
with
the
first
load
or
there
would
have
been
nothing
left
of
us
when
we
let
a
sleigh
go
from
the
top
it
jumps
about
fifty
feet
clear
and
comes
down
in
pieces
we
loaded
up
the
sleighs
with
some
of
our
stuff
about
two
hundred
and
pounds
each
and
started
across
the
lakes
the
trail
was
awful
and
we
waded
through
water
and
slush
two
and
three
feet
deep
we
got
to
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
at
about
eight
at
night
done
out
we
left
there
that
night
and
pushed
on
again
until
morning
we
got
to
the
bottom
of
an
awful
hill
and
packed
all
our
stuff
from
there
to
the
hill
above
the
lake
we
had
about
two
and
a
half
miles
over
hills
in
snow
and
slush
i
carried
about
five
hundred
pounds
over
that
part
of
the
trail
we
had
to
get
dogs
to
bring
the
stuff
down
from
the
summit
to
the
head
of
the
canyon
we
worked
two
days
bringing
the
stuff
over
from
the
canyon
to
the
hill
above
the
lake
saturday
we
worked
all
day
packing
down
the
hill
to
the
lake
and
came
here
on
a
scow
we
were
out
yesterday
morning
cutting
down
trees
to
build
a
boat
the
timber
is
small
and
i
do
think
we
can
get
more
than
stuff
it
rained
all
afternoon
and
we
could
do
anything
there
are
about
fifty
boats
of
all
sorts
on
lake
bennet
which
is
about
half
a
mile
from
here
i
have
long
rubber
boots
up
to
the
hips
and
i
did
not
have
them
on
coming
from
the
summit
down
but
i
have
worn
them
ever
since
we
met
barwell
and
lewis
of
ottawa
they
were
out
looking
for
knees
for
their
boats
they
left
ottawa
six
weeks
ago
and
have
not
got
any
farther
than
we
have
there
was
a
little
going
here
and
they
have
their
lumber
sawn
we
have
it
that
warm
some
days
here
that
you
would
fairly
roast
and
the
next
day
you
would
be
looking
for
your
overcoat
everybody
here
seems
to
be
taking
in
enough
food
to
do
them
a
couple
of
years
we
are
now
in
canadian
territory
after
we
passed
the
summit
i
will
have
to
catch
somebody
going
through
to
dyea
to
give
him
this
letter
but
i
do
know
how
long
before
i
can
get
any
one
going
through
this
is
the
last
you
will
hear
from
me
until
i
get
down
to
the
klondyke
stewart
adds
i
wrote
this
in
the
tent
at
at
night
during
twilight
if
you
take
this
trip
in
winter
however
you
have
to
purchase
a
sled
at
juneau
and
sled
it
over
the
frozen
waterways
to
dawson
city
for
the
benefit
of
my
readers
in
canada
and
for
parties
leaving
for
the
great
northwest
territory
for
the
gold
fields
i
take
pleasure
in
quoting
the
following
description
of
a
canadian
route
canadians
should
awaken
to
the
fact
that
they
have
emphatically
inside
track
to
their
own
gold
fields
a
route
not
half
the
distance
largely
covered
by
railways
and
steamboats
with
supply
stations
at
convenient
intervals
all
the
way
by
this
route
the
can
be
reached
in
two
months
or
six
weeks
and
the
cost
of
travel
is
ridiculously
cheap
nearly
anybody
can
afford
to
go
even
now
and
by
the
spring
it
should
be
fitted
out
for
the
accommodation
of
any
amount
of
traffic
the
details
of
the
information
in
the
following
article
are
given
by
heming
the
artist
who
accompanied
whitney
in
his
journey
towards
the
barren
lands
and
the
data
may
be
accepted
as
correct
as
they
were
secured
from
the
hudson
bay
officials
the
details
of
the
inland
canadian
route
briefly
are
as
follows
by
to
calgary
and
thence
north
by
rail
to
edmonton
from
there
by
stage
to
athabasca
landing
miles
then
there
is
a
continuous
waterway
for
canoe
travel
to
fort
macpherson
at
the
mouth
of
the
mackenzie
river
from
which
point
the
peel
river
lies
southward
to
the
gold
region
the
exact
figures
are
as
follows
miles
edmonton
to
athabasca
landing
to
port
mcmurray
fort
chippewyan
smith
landing
fort
smith
fort
resolution
fort
providence
fort
simpson
fort
wrigley
fort
norman
fort
good
hope
fort
macpherson
total
there
are
only
two
portages
on
this
route
of
any
size
that
from
edmonton
to
athabasca
landing
over
which
there
is
a
stage
and
wagon
line
and
at
smith
landing
sixteen
miles
over
which
the
hudson
bay
company
has
a
tramway
there
are
four
or
five
other
portages
of
a
few
hundred
yards
but
with
these
exceptions
there
is
a
fine
down
grade
water
route
all
the
way
it
is
the
old
hudson
bay
trunk
line
to
the
north
that
has
been
in
use
for
nearly
a
century
wherever
there
is
a
lake
or
a
long
stretch
of
deep
water
river
navigation
the
company
has
small
freight
steamers
which
ply
back
and
forward
during
the
summer
between
the
portage
points
or
shallows
with
comparatively
little
expenditure
the
company
or
the
government
can
improve
the
facilities
along
the
line
so
that
any
amount
of
freight
or
any
number
of
passengers
can
be
taken
into
the
gold
region
at
less
than
half
the
time
and
cost
that
it
takes
americans
to
reach
it
from
port
michael
at
the
mouth
of
the
yukon
to
the
klondyke
exclusive
of
the
steamer
trip
of
miles
from
seattle
to
port
michael
canadians
can
leave
here
on
a
monday
at
and
reach
edmonton
on
friday
at
from
that
point
a
party
of
three
men
with
a
canoe
should
reach
fort
macpherson
easily
in
from
to
days
provided
they
are
young
fellows
with
experience
in
that
sort
of
travel
they
will
need
to
take
canoes
from
here
unless
they
propose
to
hire
indians
with
large
birch
bark
canoes
to
carry
them
birch
bark
canoes
can
be
secured
of
any
size
up
to
the
big
ones
manned
by
ten
indians
that
carry
three
tons
but
birch
barks
are
not
reliable
unless
indians
are
taken
along
to
doctor
them
and
keep
them
from
getting
the
hudson
bay
company
will
also
contract
to
take
freight
northward
on
their
steamers
until
the
close
of
navigation
travellers
to
the
gold
mines
leaving
now
would
probably
reach
fort
macpherson
before
navigation
closed
the
letter
from
rev
stringer
the
missionary
published
in
the
spectator
on
july
shows
that
the
ice
had
only
commenced
to
run
in
the
peel
river
which
is
the
water
route
from
fort
macpherson
into
the
gold
region
on
september
last
year
any
canadians
who
are
anxious
to
get
into
the
klondyke
ahead
of
the
americans
can
leave
between
now
and
august
reach
fort
macpherson
and
if
winter
comes
on
they
can
exchange
their
canoes
for
dog
trains
and
reach
the
klondyke
without
half
the
difficulty
that
would
be
experienced
on
the
alaska
route
the
great
advantage
of
the
inland
route
is
that
it
is
an
organized
line
of
communication
travellers
need
not
carry
any
more
food
than
will
take
them
from
one
hudson
bay
post
to
the
next
and
then
there
is
abundance
of
fish
and
wild
fowl
en
route
they
can
also
be
in
touch
with
such
civilization
as
prevails
up
there
can
always
get
assistance
at
the
posts
and
will
have
some
place
to
stay
should
they
fall
sick
or
meet
with
an
accident
if
they
are
lucky
enough
to
make
their
pile
in
the
klondyke
they
can
come
back
by
the
dog
sled
route
during
the
winter
there
is
one
winter
mail
to
fort
macpherson
in
winter
dogs
for
teams
can
be
purchased
at
nearly
any
of
the
line
of
hudson
bay
posts
that
form
a
chain
of
on
the
trip
parties
travelling
alone
will
not
need
to
employ
guides
until
they
get
near
fort
macpherson
and
from
there
on
to
the
klondyke
as
the
rest
of
the
route
from
edmonton
is
so
well
defined
having
been
travelled
for
years
that
no
guides
are
required
you
do
need
a
couple
of
thousand
dollars
to
start
for
klondyke
by
the
edmonton
route
all
you
need
is
a
good
constitution
some
experience
in
boating
and
camping
and
about
suppose
a
party
of
three
decide
to
start
first
they
will
need
to
purchase
a
canoe
about
or
less
ticket
from
hamilton
to
edmonton
second
class
ditto
cost
of
food
at
edmonton
for
three
men
for
two
months
should
consist
of
pork
flour
tea
and
freight
on
canoe
to
edmonton
total
for
three
men
from
hamilton
to
fort
macpherson
provided
they
travel
on
the
will
be
these
figures
are
furnished
by
heming
who
has
been
over
the
route
miles
north
of
edmonton
and
got
the
rest
of
his
data
from
the
hudson
bay
officials
if
three
men
chip
in
each
they
would
have
a
margin
of
over
for
purchasing
their
tools
and
for
transport
from
fort
macpherson
to
the
klondyke
this
is
how
it
may
be
done
on
the
cheap
though
heming
considers
it
ample
for
any
party
starting
this
summer
prices
will
likely
rise
on
the
route
when
the
rush
begins
if
the
hudson
bay
people
are
alive
to
their
interests
they
will
forward
a
large
amount
of
supplies
for
fort
macpherson
immediately
and
make
it
the
base
of
supplies
for
the
klondyke
during
the
coming
winter
parties
should
consist
of
three
men
each
as
that
is
the
crew
of
a
canoe
it
will
take
pounds
of
food
to
carry
three
men
over
the
route
passengers
on
the
are
entitled
to
carry
pounds
of
baggage
the
paddling
is
all
down
stream
except
when
they
turn
south
up
peel
river
and
sails
should
be
taken
as
there
is
often
a
favorable
wind
for
days
there
are
large
scows
on
the
line
manned
by
ten
men
each
and
known
as
heads
they
are
like
canal
boats
but
are
punted
along
and
are
used
by
the
hudson
bay
people
for
taking
forward
supplies
to
the
forts
the
return
trip
to
the
united
states
is
usually
made
by
the
yukon
steamers
from
dawson
city
direct
to
michael
via
the
yukon
and
anvik
river
thence
by
ocean
steamer
from
michael
to
san
francisco
the
following
letter
is
interesting
to
the
prospector
as
showing
the
difficulties
to
overcome
up
the
taiya
pass
to
lake
lindeman
july
a
letter
has
been
received
from
george
mcleod
one
of
the
members
of
the
winnipeg
party
of
gold
hunters
that
left
here
recently
for
the
yukon
he
wrote
from
lake
lindeman
under
date
of
july
and
states
that
the
party
expected
to
leave
on
the
journey
from
the
river
a
week
later
they
had
a
fine
boat
with
a
freight
capacity
of
two
tons
about
completed
the
real
work
of
the
expedition
started
when
the
small
steamer
which
conveyed
the
party
from
juneau
arrived
at
dyea
the
men
had
to
transfer
their
goods
to
a
lighter
one
mile
from
shore
each
man
looking
after
his
own
packages
after
getting
everything
ashore
the
party
was
organized
for
ascent
of
the
mountain
pass
which
at
the
hardest
point
is
feet
above
sea
level
mcleod
and
his
chum
to
save
time
and
money
too
engaged
indians
to
pack
their
supplies
over
the
mountains
but
they
had
to
carry
their
own
bedding
and
grub
to
keep
them
on
the
road
it
is
fifteen
miles
to
the
summit
of
the
pass
and
the
party
made
twelve
miles
the
first
day
going
into
camp
at
night
tired
from
climbing
over
rocks
stumps
logs
and
hills
working
through
rivers
and
creeks
and
pushing
their
way
through
brush
at
the
end
of
twelve
miles
they
thought
they
had
gone
fifty
on
the
second
day
out
they
began
to
scale
the
summit
of
the
mountain
hill
after
hill
confronted
them
each
one
being
steeper
than
the
last
there
was
snow
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
rain
was
falling
and
this
added
greatly
to
the
difficulties
of
the
ascent
in
many
places
the
men
had
to
crawl
on
their
hands
and
knees
so
precipitous
was
the
mountain
side
time
after
time
the
men
would
slip
back
several
inches
but
they
recovered
themselves
and
went
at
it
again
finally
the
summit
was
gained
mcleod
being
the
first
of
the
party
to
reach
the
top
after
resting
and
changing
their
clothes
the
descent
was
commenced
mcleod
and
his
chums
purchased
sleighs
on
which
they
loaded
their
goods
and
hauled
for
five
miles
this
was
extremely
laborious
work
and
the
men
were
so
used
up
working
in
the
scorching
sun
that
they
were
compelled
to
work
at
nights
and
sleep
during
the
day
two
days
after
the
descent
began
the
sleighs
were
abandoned
and
the
men
packed
the
goods
for
three
miles
and
a
half
they
were
fortunate
in
securing
the
services
of
a
man
who
had
two
horses
to
convey
the
goods
to
lake
lindeman
mcleod
says
the
worry
in
getting
over
the
pass
is
terrible
and
he
has
no
desire
to
repeat
the
experience
he
advises
all
who
go
in
to
have
their
goods
packed
all
the
way
from
dyea
to
lake
lindeman
it
costs
or
cents
per
pound
for
packing
mcleod
expected
that
klondyke
would
not
be
reached
before
july
i
think
it
specially
valuable
for
the
reader
to
give
him
the
approximate
distances
to
fort
cudahy
which
is
below
dawson

various

this
table
of

has
been
prepared
by
james
ogilvie
and
i
also
give
a
number
of

will

keeping

reached

here
the

were
slaughtered
and
the
meat
floated
down
on

where
it
retailed
at

it
is
proposed
to

travelled
over
by

and
bounds
the

can
not
be
followed
the
ice
being
too
much
broken
so
that
any

will
have
to
be
overland
a
thorough
exploration
is
now
being
made
of
all
the
passes
at
the
head
of
lynn
canal
and
of
the
upper
waters
of
the
yukon
in
a
few
months
it
is
expected
that
the
best
routes
for
reaching
the
district
from
lynn
canal
will
be
definitely
known
it
is
said
by
those
familiar
with
the
locality
that
the
storms
which
rage
in
the
upper
altitudes
of
the
coast
range
during
the
greater
part
of
the
time
from
october
to
march
are
terrific
a
man
caught
in
one
of
them
runs
the
risk
of
losing
his
life
unless
he
can
reach
shelter
in
a
short
time
during
the
summer
there
is
nearly
always
a
wind
blowing
from
the
sea
up
chatham
strait
and
lynn
canal
which
lie
in
almost
a
straight
line
with
each
other
and
at
the
head
of
lynn
canal
are
chilkat
and
chilkoot
inlets
the
distance
from
the
coast
down
these
channels
to
the
open
sea
is
about
miles
the
mountains
on
each
side
of
the
water
confine
the
currents
of
air
and
deflect
inclined
currents
in
the
direction
of
the
axis
of
the
channel
so
that
there
is
nearly
always
a
strong
wind
blowing
up
the
channel
coming
from
the
sea
this
wind
is
heavily
charged
with
moisture
which
is
precipitated
when
the
air
currents
strike
the
mountains
and
the
fall
of
rain
and
snow
is
consequently
very
heavy
in
chilkat
inlet
there
is
not
much
shelter
from
the
south
wind
which
renders
it
unsafe
for
ships
calling
there
capt
hunter
told
me
he
would
rather
visit
any
other
part
of
the
coast
than
chilkat
to
carry
the
survey
from
the
island
across
to
chilkoot
inlet
i
had
to
get
up
on
the
mountains
north
of
haines
mission
and
from
there
could
see
both
inlets
owing
to
the
bad
weather
i
could
get
no
observation
for
azimuth
and
had
to
produce
the
survey
from
pyramid
island
to
taiya
inlet
by
reading
the
angles
of
deflection
between
the
courses
at
taiya
inlet
i
got
my
first
observation
and
deduced
the
azimuths
of
my
courses
up
to
that
point
taiya
inlet
has
evidently
been
the
valley
of
a
glacier
its
sides
are
steep
and
smooth
from
glacial
action
and
this
with
the
wind
almost
constantly
blowing
landward
renders
getting
upon
the
shore
difficult
some
long
sights
were
therefore
necessary
the
survey
was
made
up
to
the
head
of
the
inlet
on
the
of
june
preparations
were
then
commenced
for
taking
the
supplies
and
instruments
over
the
coast
range
of
mountains
to
the
head
of
lake
lindeman
on
the
lewes
river
commander
newell
kindly
aided
me
in
making
arrangements
with
the
indians
and
did
all
he
could
to
induce
them
to
be
reasonable
in
their
demands
this
however
neither
he
nor
any
one
else
could
accomplish
they
refused
to
carry
to
the
lake
for
less
than
per
hundred
pounds
and
as
they
had
learned
that
the
expedition
was
an
english
one
the
second
chief
of
the
chilkoot
indians
recalled
some
memories
of
an
old
quarrel
which
the
tribe
had
with
the
english
many
years
ago
in
which
an
uncle
of
his
was
killed
and
he
thought
we
should
pay
for
the
loss
of
his
uncle
by
being
charged
an
exorbitant
price
for
our
packing
of
which
he
had
the
sole
control
commander
newell
told
him
i
had
a
permit
from
the
great
father
at
washington
to
pass
through
his
country
safely
that
he
would
see
that
i
did
so
and
if
the
indians
interfered
with
me
they
would
be
punished
for
doing
so
after
much
talk
they
consented
to
carry
our
stuff
to
the
summit
of
the
mountain
for
per
hundred
pounds
this
is
about
of
the
whole
distance
includes
all
the
climbing
and
all
the
woods
and
is
by
far
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
way
on
the
of
june
indians
men
women
and
children
started
for
the
summit
i
sent
two
of
my
party
with
them
to
see
the
goods
delivered
at
the
place
agreed
upon
each
carrier
when
given
a
pack
also
got
a
ticket
on
which
was
inscribed
the
contents
of
the
pack
its
weight
and
the
amount
the
individual
was
to
get
for
carrying
it
they
were
made
to
understand
that
they
had
to
produce
these
tickets
on
delivering
their
packs
but
were
not
told
for
what
reason
as
each
pack
was
delivered
one
of
my
men
receipted
the
ticket
and
returned
it
the
indians
did
not
seem
to
understand
the
import
of
this
a
few
of
them
pretended
to
have
lost
their
tickets
and
as
they
could
not
get
paid
without
them
my
assistant
who
had
duplicates
of
every
ticket
furnished
them
with
receipted
copies
after
examining
their
packs
while
they
were
packing
to
the
summit
i
was
producing
the
survey
and
i
met
them
on
their
return
at
the
foot
of
the
cañon
about
eight
miles
from
the
coast
where
i
paid
them
they
came
to
the
camp
in
the
early
morning
before
i
was
up
and
for
about
two
hours
there
was
quite
a
hubbub
when
paying
them
i
tried
to
get
their
names
but
very
few
of
them
would
give
any
indian
name
nearly
all
after
a
little
reflection
giving
some
common
english
name
my
list
contained
little
else
than
jack
tom
joe
charlie
some
of
which
were
duplicated
three
and
four
times
i
then
found
why
some
of
them
had
pretended
to
lose
their
tickets
at
the
summit
three
or
four
who
had
thus
acted
presented
themselves
twice
for
payment
producing
first
the
receipted
ticket
afterwards
the
one
they
claimed
to
have
lost
demanding
pay
for
both
they
were
much
taken
aback
when
they
found
that
their
duplicity
had
been
discovered
these
indians
are
perfectly
heartless
they
will
not
render
even
the
smallest
aid
to
each
other
without
payment
and
if
not
to
each
other
much
less
to
a
white
man
i
got
one
of
them
whom
i
had
previously
assisted
with
his
pack
to
take
me
and
two
of
my
party
over
a
small
creek
in
his
canoe
after
putting
us
across
he
asked
for
money
and
i
gave
him
half
a
dollar
another
man
stepped
up
and
demanded
pay
stating
that
the
canoe
was
his
to
see
what
the
result
would
be
i
gave
to
him
the
same
amount
as
to
the
first
immediately
there
were
three
or
four
more
claimants
for
the
canoe
i
dismissed
them
with
a
blessing
and
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
wade
the
next
creek
while
paying
them
i
was
a
little
apprehensive
of
trouble
for
they
insisted
on
crowding
into
my
tent
and
for
myself
and
the
four
men
who
were
with
me
to
have
attempted
to
eject
them
would
have
been
to
invite
trouble
i
am
strongly
of
the
opinion
that
these
indians
would
have
been
much
more
difficult
to
deal
with
if
they
had
not
known
that
commander
newell
remained
in
the
inlet
to
see
that
i
got
through
without
accident
while
making
the
survey
from
the
head
of
tide
water
i
took
the
azimuths
and
altitudes
of
several
of
the
highest
peaks
around
the
head
of
the
inlet
in
order
to
locate
them
and
obtain
an
idea
of
the
general
height
of
the
peaks
in
the
coast
range
as
it
does
not
appear
to
have
been
done
before
i
have
taken
the
opportunity
of
naming
all
the
peaks
the
positions
of
which
i
fixed
in
the
above
way
the
names
and
altitudes
appear
on
my
map
while
going
up
from
the
head
of
canoe
navigation
on
the
taiya
river
i
took
the
angles
of
elevation
of
each
station
from
the
preceding
one
i
would
have
done
this
from
tide
water
up
but
found
many
of
the
courses
so
short
and
with
so
little
increase
in
height
that
with
the
instrument
i
had
it
was
inappreciable
from
these
angles
i
have
computed
the
height
of
the
summit
of
the
taiya
pass
above
the
head
of
canoe
navigation
as
it
appeared
to
me
in
june
and
find
it
to
be
feet
what
depth
of
snow
there
was
i
can
not
say
the
head
of
canoe
navigation
i
estimate
at
about
feet
above
tide
water
dawson
gives
it
as
feet
footnote
the
distance
from
the
head
of
taiya
inlet
to
the
summit
of
the
pass
is
miles
and
the
whole
length
of
the
pass
to
lake
lindeman
is
miles
healy
and
wilson
dealers
in
general
merchandise
and
miners
supplies
at
taiya
have
a
train
of
pack
horses
carrying
freight
from
the
head
of
lynn
canal
to
the
summit
they
hope
to
be
able
to
take
freight
through
to
lake
lindeman
with
their
horses
during
the
present
season
i
determined
the
descent
from
the
summit
to
lake
lindeman
by
carrying
the
aneroid
from
the
lake
to
the
summit
and
back
again
the
interval
of
time
from
start
to
return
being
about
eight
hours
taking
the
mean
of
the
readings
at
the
lake
start
and
return
and
the
single
reading
at
the
summit
the
height
of
the
summit
above
the
lake
was
found
to
be
feet
while
making
the
survey
from
the
summit
down
to
the
lake
i
took
the
angles
of
depression
of
each
station
from
the
preceding
one
and
from
these
angles
i
deduced
the
difference
of
height
which
i
found
to
be
feet
or
feet
more
than
that
found
by
the
aneroid
this
is
quite
a
large
difference
but
when
we
consider
the
altitude
of
the
place
the
sudden
changes
of
temperature
and
the
atmospheric
conditions
it
is
not
more
than
one
might
expect
while
at
juneau
i
heard
reports
of
a
low
pass
from
the
head
of
chilkoot
inlet
to
the
head
waters
of
lewes
river
during
the
time
i
was
at
the
head
of
taiya
inlet
i
made
inquiries
regarding
it
and
found
that
there
was
such
a
pass
but
could
learn
nothing
definite
about
it
from
either
whites
or
indians
as
capt
moore
who
accompanied
me
was
very
anxious
to
go
through
it
and
as
the
reports
of
the
taiya
pass
indicated
that
no
wagon
road
or
railroad
could
ever
be
built
through
it
while
the
new
pass
appeared
from
what
little
knowledge
i
could
get
of
it
to
be
much
lower
and
possibly
feasible
for
a
wagon
road
i
determined
to
send
the
captain
by
that
way
if
i
could
get
an
indian
to
accompany
him
this
i
found
would
be
difficult
to
do
none
of
the
chilkoots
appeared
to
know
anything
of
the
pass
and
i
concluded
that
they
wished
to
keep
its
existence
and
condition
a
secret
the
tagish
or
stick
indians
as
the
interior
indians
are
locally
called
are
afraid
to
do
anything
in
opposition
to
the
wishes
of
the
chilkoots
so
it
was
difficult
to
get
any
of
them
to
join
capt
moore
but
after
much
talk
and
encouragement
from
the
whites
around
one
of
them
named
jim
was
induced
to
go
he
had
been
through
this
pass
before
and
proved
reliable
and
useful
the
information
obtained
from
capt
moore
exploration
i
have
incorporated
in
my
plan
of
the
survey
from
taiya
inlet
but
it
is
not
as
complete
as
i
would
have
liked
i
have
named
this
pass
white
pass
in
honor
of
the
late
hon
thos
white
minister
of
the
interior
under
whose
authority
the
expedition
was
organized
commencing
at
taiya
inlet
about
two
miles
south
of
its
north
end
it
follows
up
the
valley
of
the
shkagway
river
to
its
source
and
thence
down
the
valley
of
another
river
which
capt
moore
reported
to
empty
into
the
takone
or
windy
arm
of
bove
lake
schwatka
dawson
says
this
stream
empties
into
taku
arm
and
in
that
event
capt
moore
is
mistaken
capt
moore
did
not
go
all
the
way
through
to
the
lake
but
assumed
from
reports
he
heard
from
the
miners
and
others
that
the
stream
flowed
into
windy
arm
and
this
also
was
the
idea
of
the
indian
jim
from
what
i
could
gather
from
his
remarks
in
broken
english
and
chinook
capt
moore
estimates
the
distance
from
tide
water
to
the
summit
at
about
miles
and
from
the
summit
to
the
lake
at
about
to
miles
he
reports
the
pass
as
thickly
timbered
all
the
way
through
the
timber
line
on
the
south
side
of
the
taiya
pass
as
determined
by
barometer
reading
is
about
feet
above
the
sea
while
on
the
north
side
it
is
about
feet
below
the
summit
this
large
difference
is
due
i
think
to
the
different
conditions
in
the
two
places
on
the
south
side
the
valley
is
narrow
and
deep
and
the
sun
can
not
produce
its
full
effect
the
snow
also
is
much
deeper
there
owing
to
the
quantity
which
drifts
in
from
the
surrounding
mountains
on
the
north
side
the
surface
is
sloping
and
more
exposed
to
the
sun
rays
on
the
south
side
the
timber
is
of
the
class
peculiar
to
the
coast
and
on
the
north
that
peculiar
to
the
interior
the
latter
would
grow
at
a
greater
altitude
than
the
coast
timber
it
is
possible
that
the
summit
of
white
pass
is
not
higher
than
the
timber
line
on
the
north
of
the
taiya
pass
or
about
feet
above
tide
water
and
it
is
possibly
even
lower
than
this
as
the
timber
in
a
valley
such
as
the
white
pass
would
hardly
live
at
the
same
altitude
as
on
the
open
slope
on
the
north
side
capt
moore
has
had
considerable
experience
in
building
roads
in
mountainous
countries
he
considers
that
this
would
be
an
easy
route
for
a
wagon
road
compared
with
some
roads
he
has
seen
in
british
columbia
assuming
his
distances
to
be
correct
and
the
height
of
the
pass
to
be
probably
about
correctly
indicated
the
grades
would
not
be
very
steep
and
a
railroad
could
easily
be
carried
through
if
necessary
after
completing
the
survey
down
to
the
lake
i
set
about
getting
my
baggage
down
too
of
all
the
indians
who
came
to
the
summit
with
packs
only
four
or
five
could
be
induced
to
remain
and
pack
down
to
the
lake
although
i
was
paying
them
at
the
rate
of
per
hundred
pounds
after
one
trip
down
only
two
men
remained
and
they
only
in
hopes
of
stealing
something
one
of
them
appropriated
a
pair
of
boots
and
was
much
surprised
to
find
that
he
had
to
pay
for
them
on
being
settled
with
i
could
not
blame
them
much
for
not
caring
to
work
as
the
weather
was
very
disagreeable
it
rained
or
snowed
almost
continuously
after
the
indians
left
i
tried
to
get
down
the
stuff
with
the
aid
of
my
own
men
but
it
was
slavish
and
unhealthy
labor
and
after
the
first
trip
one
of
them
was
laid
up
with
what
appeared
to
be
inflammatory
rheumatism
the
first
time
the
party
crossed
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
and
this
brought
on
snow
blindness
the
pain
of
which
only
those
who
have
suffered
from
this
complaint
can
realize
i
had
two
sleds
with
me
which
were
made
in
juneau
specially
for
the
work
of
getting
over
the
mountains
and
down
the
lakes
on
the
ice
with
these
i
succeeded
in
bringing
about
a
ton
and
to
the
lakes
but
found
that
the
time
it
would
take
to
get
all
down
in
this
way
would
seriously
interfere
with
the
programme
arranged
with
dawson
to
say
nothing
of
the
suffering
of
the
men
and
myself
and
the
liability
to
sickness
which
protracted
physical
exertion
under
such
uncomfortable
conditions
and
continued
suffering
from
snow
blindness
expose
us
to
i
had
with
me
a
white
man
who
lived
at
the
head
of
the
inlet
with
a
tagish
indian
woman
this
man
had
a
good
deal
of
influence
with
the
tagish
tribe
of
whom
the
greater
number
were
then
in
the
neighborhood
where
he
resided
trying
to
get
some
odd
jobs
of
work
and
i
sent
him
to
the
head
of
the
inlet
to
try
and
induce
the
tagish
indians
to
undertake
the
transportation
offering
them
per
hundred
pounds
in
the
meantime
capt
moore
and
the
indian
jim
had
rejoined
me
i
had
their
assistance
for
a
day
or
two
and
jim
presence
aided
indirectly
in
inducing
the
indians
to
come
to
my
relief
the
tagish
are
little
more
than
slaves
to
the
more
powerful
coast
tribes
and
are
in
constant
dread
of
offending
them
in
any
way
one
of
the
privileges
which
the
coast
tribes
claim
is
the
exclusive
right
to
all
work
on
the
coast
or
in
its
vicinity
and
the
tagish
are
afraid
to
dispute
this
claim
when
my
white
man
asked
the
tagish
to
come
over
and
pack
they
objected
on
the
grounds
mentioned
after
considerable
ridicule
of
their
cowardice
and
explanation
of
the
fact
that
they
had
the
exclusive
right
to
all
work
in
their
own
country
the
country
on
the
side
of
the
north
side
of
the
coast
range
being
admitted
by
the
coast
indians
to
belong
to
the
tagish
tribe
just
as
the
coast
tribes
had
the
privilege
of
doing
all
the
work
on
the
coast
side
of
the
mountains
and
that
one
of
their
number
was
already
working
with
me
unmolested
and
likely
to
continue
so
nine
of
them
came
over
and
in
fear
and
trembling
began
to
pack
down
to
the
lake
after
they
were
at
work
for
a
few
days
some
of
the
chilkoots
came
out
and
also
started
to
work
soon
i
had
quite
a
number
at
work
and
was
getting
my
stuff
down
quite
fast
but
this
good
fortune
was
not
to
continue
owing
to
the
prevailing
wet
cold
weather
on
the
mountains
and
the
difficulty
of
getting
through
the
soft
wet
snow
the
indians
soon
began
to
quit
work
for
a
day
or
two
at
a
time
and
to
gamble
with
one
another
for
the
wages
already
earned
many
of
them
wanted
to
be
paid
in
full
but
this
i
positively
refused
knowing
that
to
do
so
was
to
have
them
all
apply
for
their
earnings
and
leave
me
until
necessity
compelled
them
to
go
to
work
again
i
once
for
all
made
them
distinctly
understand
that
i
would
not
pay
any
of
them
until
the
whole
of
the
stuff
was
down
as
many
of
them
had
already
earned
from
twelve
to
fifteen
dollars
each
to
lose
which
was
a
serious
matter
to
them
they
reluctantly
resumed
work
and
kept
at
it
until
all
was
delivered
this
done
i
paid
them
off
and
set
about
getting
my
outfit
across
the
lake
which
i
did
with
my
own
party
and
the
two
peterborough
canoes
which
i
had
with
me
these
two
canoes
travelled
about
miles
by
rail
and
about
miles
by
steamship
before
being
brought
into
service
they
did
considerable
work
on
chilkoot
and
tagish
inlets
and
were
then
packed
over
to
the
head
of
lewes
river
lake
lindeman
from
where
they
were
used
in
making
the
survey
of
lewes
and
yukon
rivers
in
this
work
they
made
about
landings
they
were
then
transported
on
sleighs
from
the
boundary
on
the
yukon
to
navigable
water
on
the
porcupine
in
the
spring
of
they
descended
the
latter
river
heavily
loaded
and
through
much
rough
water
to
the
mouth
of
bell
river
and
up
it
to
mcdougall
pass
they
were
then
carried
over
the
pass
to
poplar
river
and
were
used
in
going
down
the
latter
to
peel
river
and
thence
up
mackenzie
river
miles
or
exclusive
of
railway
and
ship
carriage
they
were
carried
about
miles
and
did
about
miles
of
work
for
the
expedition
making
in
all
about
landings
in
no
easy
manner
and
going
through
some
very
bad
water
i
left
them
at
fort
chipewyan
in
fairly
good
condition
and
with
a
little
painting
they
would
go
through
the
same
ordeal
again
after
getting
all
my
outfit
over
to
the
foot
of
lake
lindeman
i
set
some
of
the
party
to
pack
it
to
the
head
of
lake
bennet
i
employed
the
rest
of
the
party
in
looking
for
timber
to
build
a
boat
to
carry
my
outfit
of
provisions
and
implements
down
the
river
to
the
vicinity
of
the
international
boundary
a
distance
of
about
miles
it
took
several
days
to
find
a
tree
large
enough
to
make
plank
for
the
boat
i
wanted
as
the
timber
around
the
upper
end
of
the
lake
is
small
and
scrubby
my
boat
was
finished
on
the
evening
of
the
of
july
and
on
the
i
started
a
portion
of
the
party
to
load
it
and
go
ahead
with
it
and
the
outfit
to
the
cañon
they
had
instructions
to
examine
the
cañon
and
if
necessary
to
carry
a
part
of
the
outfit
past
it
in
any
case
enough
to
support
the
party
back
to
the
coast
should
accident
necessitate
such
procedure
with
the
rest
of
the
party
i
started
to
carry
on
the
survey
which
may
now
be
said
to
have
fairly
started
ahead
on
the
lakes
this
proved
tedious
work
on
account
of
the
stormy
weather
in
the
summer
months
there
is
nearly
always
a
wind
blowing
in
from
the
coast
it
blows
down
the
lakes
and
produces
quite
a
heavy
swell
this
would
not
prevent
the
canoes
going
with
the
decks
on
but
as
we
had
to
land
every
mile
or
so
the
rollers
breaking
on
the
generally
flat
beach
proved
very
troublesome
on
this
account
i
found
i
could
not
average
more
than
ten
miles
per
day
on
the
lakes
little
more
than
half
of
what
could
be
done
on
the
river
the
survey
was
completed
to
the
cañon
on
the
of
july
there
i
found
the
party
with
the
large
boat
had
arrived
on
the
having
carried
a
part
of
the
supplies
past
the
cañon
and
were
awaiting
my
arrival
to
run
through
it
with
the
rest
in
the
boat
before
doing
so
however
i
made
an
examination
of
the
cañon
the
rapids
below
it
particularly
the
last
rapid
of
the
series
called
the
white
horse
by
the
miners
i
found
would
not
be
safe
to
run
i
sent
two
men
through
the
cañon
in
one
of
the
canoes
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
boat
and
to
be
ready
in
case
of
an
accident
to
pick
us
up
every
man
in
the
party
was
supplied
with
a
so
that
should
a
casualty
occur
we
would
all
have
floated
those
in
the
canoe
got
through
all
right
but
they
would
not
have
liked
to
repeat
the
trip
they
said
the
canoe
jumped
about
a
great
deal
more
than
they
thought
it
would
and
i
had
the
same
experience
when
going
through
in
the
boat
the
passage
through
is
made
in
about
three
minutes
or
at
the
rate
of
about
miles
an
hour
if
the
boat
is
kept
clear
of
the
sides
there
is
not
much
danger
in
high
water
but
in
low
water
there
is
a
rock
in
the
middle
of
the
channel
near
the
upper
end
of
the
cañon
that
renders
the
passage
more
difficult
i
did
not
see
this
rock
myself
but
got
my
information
from
some
miners
i
met
in
the
interior
who
described
it
as
being
about
yards
down
from
the
head
and
a
little
to
the
west
of
the
middle
of
the
channel
in
low
water
it
barely
projects
above
the
surface
when
i
passed
through
there
was
no
indication
of
it
either
from
the
bank
above
or
from
the
boat
the
distance
from
the
head
to
the
foot
of
the
cañon
is
of
a
mile
there
is
a
basin
about
midway
in
it
about
yards
in
diameter
this
basin
is
circular
in
form
with
steep
sloping
sides
about
feet
high
the
lower
part
of
the
cañon
is
much
rougher
to
run
through
than
the
upper
part
the
fall
being
apparently
much
greater
the
sides
are
generally
perpendicular
about
to
feet
high
and
consist
of
basalt
in
some
places
showing
hexagonal
columns
the
white
horse
rapids
are
about
of
a
mile
long
they
are
the
most
dangerous
rapids
on
the
river
and
are
never
run
through
in
boats
except
by
accident
they
are
confined
by
low
basaltic
banks
which
at
the
foot
suddenly
close
in
and
make
the
channel
about
yards
wide
it
is
here
the
danger
lies
as
there
is
a
sudden
drop
and
the
water
rashes
through
at
a
tremendous
rate
leaping
and
seething
like
a
cataract
the
miners
have
constructed
a
portage
road
on
the
west
side
and
put
down
rollways
in
some
places
on
which
to
shove
their
boats
over
they
have
also
made
some
windlasses
with
which
to
haul
their
boats
up
hill
notably
one
at
the
foot
of
the
cañon
this
roadway
and
windlasses
must
have
cost
them
many
hours
of
hard
labor
should
it
ever
be
necessary
a
tramway
could
be
built
past
the
cañon
on
the
east
side
with
no
great
difficulty
with
the
exception
of
the
five
finger
rapids
these
appear
to
be
the
only
serious
rapids
on
the
whole
length
of
the
river
five
finger
rapids
are
formed
by
several
islands
standing
in
the
channel
and
backing
up
the
water
so
much
as
to
raise
it
about
a
foot
causing
a
swell
below
for
a
few
yards
the
islands
are
composed
of
conglomerate
rock
similar
to
the
cliffs
on
each
side
of
the
river
whence
one
would
infer
that
there
has
been
a
fall
here
in
past
ages
for
about
two
miles
below
the
rapids
there
is
a
pretty
swift
current
but
not
enough
to
prevent
the
ascent
of
a
steamboat
of
moderate
power
and
the
rapids
themselves
i
do
not
think
would
present
any
serious
obstacle
to
the
ascent
of
a
good
boat
in
very
high
water
warping
might
be
required
six
miles
below
these
rapids
are
what
are
known
as
rapids
this
is
simply
a
barrier
of
rocks
which
extends
from
the
westerly
side
of
the
river
about
half
way
across
over
this
barrier
there
is
a
ripple
which
would
offer
no
great
obstacle
to
the
descent
of
a
good
canoe
on
the
easterly
sides
there
is
no
ripple
and
the
current
is
smooth
and
the
water
apparently
deep
i
tried
with
a
foot
paddle
but
could
not
reach
the
bottom
on
the
of
august
i
met
a
party
of
miners
coming
out
who
had
passed
stewart
river
a
few
days
before
they
saw
no
sign
of
dawson
having
been
there
this
was
welcome
news
for
me
as
i
expected
he
would
have
reached
that
point
long
before
i
arrived
on
account
of
the
many
delays
i
had
met
with
on
the
coast
range
these
miners
also
gave
me
the
pleasant
news
that
the
story
told
at
the
coast
about
the
fight
with
the
indians
at
stewart
river
was
false
and
stated
substantially
what
i
have
already
repeated
concerning
it
the
same
evening
i
met
more
miners
on
their
way
out
and
the
next
day
met
three
boats
each
containing
four
men
in
the
crew
of
one
of
them
was
a
son
of
capt
moore
from
whom
the
captain
got
such
information
as
induced
him
to
turn
back
and
accompany
them
out
next
day
the
i
got
to
the
mouth
of
the
pelly
and
found
that
dawson
had
arrived
there
on
the
the
doctor
also
had
experienced
many
delays
and
had
heard
the
same
story
of
the
indian
uprising
in
the
interior
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
he
was
in
no
immediate
want
of
provisions
the
fear
of
which
had
caused
me
a
great
deal
of
uneasiness
on
the
way
down
the
river
as
it
was
arranged
between
us
in
victoria
that
i
was
to
take
with
me
provisions
for
his
party
to
do
them
until
their
return
to
the
coast
the
doctor
was
so
much
behind
the
time
arranged
to
meet
me
that
he
determined
to
start
for
the
coast
at
once
i
therefore
set
about
making
a
short
report
and
plan
of
my
survey
to
this
point
and
as
i
was
not
likely
to
get
another
opportunity
of
writing
at
such
length
for
a
year
i
applied
myself
to
a
correspondence
designed
to
satisfy
my
friends
and
acquaintances
for
the
ensuing
twelve
months
this
necessitated
three
days
hard
work
on
the
morning
of
the
the
doctor
left
for
the
outside
world
leaving
me
with
a
feeling
of
loneliness
that
only
those
who
have
experienced
it
can
realize
i
remained
at
the
mouth
of
the
pelly
during
the
next
day
taking
magnetic
and
astronomical
observations
and
making
some
measurements
of
the
river
on
the
i
resumed
the
survey
and
reached
white
river
on
the
here
i
spent
most
of
a
day
trying
to
ascend
this
river
but
found
it
impracticable
on
account
of
the
swift
current
and
shallow
and
very
muddy
water
the
water
is
so
muddy
that
it
is
impossible
to
see
through
of
an
inch
of
it
the
current
is
very
strong
probably
eight
miles
or
more
per
hour
and
the
numerous
bars
in
the
bed
are
constantly
changing
place
after
trying
for
several
hours
the
base
men
succeeded
in
doing
about
half
a
mile
only
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
useless
to
try
to
get
up
this
stream
to
the
boundary
with
canoes
had
it
proved
feasible
i
had
intended
making
a
survey
of
this
stream
to
the
boundary
to
discover
more
especially
the
facilities
it
offered
for
the
transport
of
supplies
in
the
event
of
a
survey
of
the
international
boundary
being
undertaken
i
reached
stewart
river
on
the
here
i
remained
a
day
taking
magnetic
observations
and
getting
information
from
a
miner
named
mcdonald
about
the
country
up
that
river
mcdonald
had
spent
the
summer
up
the
river
prospecting
and
exploring
his
information
will
be
given
in
detail
further
on
fort
reliance
was
reached
on
the
of
september
and
forty
mile
river
river
of
schwatka
on
the
in
the
interval
between
fort
reliance
and
forty
mile
river
there
were
several
days
lost
by
rain
at
forty
mile
river
i
made
some
arrangements
with
the
traders
there
harper
mcquestion
about
supplies
during
the
winter
and
about
getting
indians
to
assist
me
in
crossing
from
the
yukon
to
the
head
of
the
porcupine
or
perhaps
on
to
the
peel
river
i
then
made
a
survey
of
the
forty
mile
river
up
to
the
cañon
i
found
the
canon
would
be
difficult
of
ascent
and
dangerous
to
descend
and
therefore
concluded
to
defer
further
operations
until
the
winter
and
until
after
i
had
determined
the
longitude
of
my
winter
post
near
the
boundary
when
i
would
be
in
a
much
better
position
to
locate
the
intersection
of
the
international
boundary
with
this
river
a
point
important
to
determine
on
account
of
the
number
and
richness
of
the
mining
claims
on
the
river
i
left
forty
mile
river
for
the
boundary
line
between
alaska
and
the
northwest
territories
on
the
september
and
finished
the
survey
to
that
point
on
the
i
then
spent
two
days
in
examining
the
valley
of
the
river
in
the
vicinity
of
the
boundary
to
get
the
most
extensive
view
of
the
horizon
possible
and
to
find
a
tree
large
enough
to
serve
for
a
transit
stand
before
leaving
toronto
i
got
foster
to
make
large
brass
plates
with
v
on
them
which
could
be
screwed
firmly
to
a
stump
and
thus
be
made
to
serve
as
a
transit
stand
i
required
a
stump
at
least
inches
in
diameter
to
make
a
base
large
enough
for
the
plates
when
properly
placed
for
the
transit
in
a
search
which
covered
about
four
miles
of
the
river
bank
on
both
sides
i
found
only
one
tree
as
large
as
inches
i
mention
this
fact
to
give
an
idea
of
the
size
of
the
trees
along
the
river
in
this
vicinity
i
had
this
stump
enlarged
by
firmly
fixing
pieces
on
the
sides
so
as
to
bring
it
up
to
the
requisite
size
this
done
i
built
around
the
stump
a
small
transit
house
of
the
ordinary
form
and
then
mounted
and
adjusted
my
transit
meanwhile
most
of
the
party
were
busy
preparing
our
winter
quarters
and
building
a
magnetic
observatory
as
i
had
been
led
to
expect
extremely
low
temperatures
during
the
winter
i
adopted
precautionary
measures
so
as
to
be
as
comfortable
as
circumstances
would
permit

our
stay

more
than
fifty

sixty
yards
wide
and
two
or
three
feet
deep
and
is
so
swift
and
rough
that
navigation
is
out
of
the
question
lake
lindeman
is
about
five
miles
long

it
is
about
half

about
midway
in
its
length
an
arm
comes
in
from
the
west
which
schwatka
appears
to
have
mistaken
for
a
river
and
named

this
arm

down
to

to
be
longer

a
half
miles

the
water

about

it
is
joined
by
what
the
miners
have
called
the
windy
arm
one
of
the
tagish
indians
informed
me
they
called
it
takone
lake
here
the
lake
expands
to
a
width
of
about
two
miles
for
a
distance
of
some
three
miles
when
it
suddenly
narrows
to
about
half
a
mile
for
a
distance
of
a
little
over
a
mile
after
which
it
widens
again
to
about
a
mile
and
a
half
or
more
ten
miles
from
the
head
of
the
lake
it
is
joined
by
the
taku
arm
from
the

this
arm
must
be
of
considerable
length
as
it
can
be
seen
for
a
long
distance
and
its
valley
can
be
traced
through
the
mountains
much
farther
than
the
lake
itself
can
be
seen
it
is
apparently
over
a
mile
wide
at
its
mouth
or
junction
dawson
includes
bove
lake
and
these
two
arms
under
the
common
name
of
tagish
lake
this
is
much
more
simple
and
comprehensive
than
the
various
names
given
them
by
travellers
these
waters
collectively
are
the
fishing
and
hunting
grounds
of
the
tagish
indians
and
as
they
are
really
one
body
of
water
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
not
be
all
included
under
one
name
from
the
junction
with
the
taku
arm
to
the
north
end
of
the
lake
the
distance
is
about
six
miles
the
greater
part
being
over
two
miles
wide
the
west
side
is
very
flat
and
shallow
so
much
so
that
it
was
impossible
in
many
places
to
get
our
canoes
to
the
shore
and
quite
a
distance
out
in
the
lake
there
was
not
more
than
feet
of
water
the
members
of
my
party
who
were
in
charge
of
the
large
boat
and
outfit
went
down
the
east
side
of
the
lake
and
reported
the
depth
about
the
same
as
i
found
on
the
west
side
with
many
large
rocks
they
passed
through
it
in
the
night
in
a
rainstorm
and
were
much
alarmed
for
the
safety
of
the
boat
and
provisions
it
would
appear
that
this
part
of
the
lake
requires
some
improvement
to
make
it
in
keeping
with
the
rest
of
the
water
system
with
which
it
is
connected
where
the
river
debouches
from
it
it
is
about
yards
wide
and
for
a
short
distance
not
more
than
or
feet
deep
the
depth
is
however
soon
increased
to
feet
or
more
and
so
continues
down
to
what
schwatka
calls
marsh
lake
the
miners
call
it
mud
lake
but
on
this
name
they
do
not
appear
to
be
agreed
many
of
them
calling
the
lower
part
of
tagish
or
bove
lake
mud
lake
on
account
of
its
shallowness
and
flat
muddy
shores
as
seen
along
the
west
side
the
side
nearly
always
travelled
as
it
is
more
sheltered
from
the
prevailing
southerly
winds
the
term
mud
lake
is
however
not
applicable
to
this
lake
as
only
a
comparatively
small
part
of
it
is
shallow
or
muddy
and
it
is
nearly
as
inapplicable
to
marsh
lake
as
the
latter
is
not
markedly
muddy
along
the
west
side
and
from
the
appearance
of
the
east
shore
one
would
not
judge
it
to
be
so
as
the
banks
appear
to
be
high
and
gravelly
marsh
lake
is
a
little
over
nineteen
miles
long
and
averages
about
two
miles
in
width
i
tried
to
determine
the
width
of
it
as
i
went
along
with
my
survey
by
taking
azimuths
of
points
on
the
eastern
shore
from
different
stations
of
the
survey
but
in
only
one
case
did
i
succeed
as
there
were
no
prominent
marks
on
that
shore
which
could
be
identified
from
more
than
one
place
the
piece
of
river
connecting
tagish
and
marsh
lakes
is
about
five
miles
long
and
averages
to
yards
in
width
and
as
already
mentioned
is
deep
except
for
a
short
distance
at
the
head
on
it
are
situated
the
only
indian
houses
to
be
found
in
the
interior
with
any
pretension
to
skill
in
construction
they
show
much
more
labor
and
imitativeness
than
one
knowing
anything
about
the
indian
in
his
native
state
would
expect
the
plan
is
evidently
taken
from
the
indian
houses
on
the
coast
which
appear
to
me
to
be
a
poor
copy
of
the
houses
which
the
hudson
bay
company
servants
build
around
their
trading
posts
these
houses
do
not
appear
to
have
been
used
for
some
time
past
and
are
almost
in
ruins
the
tagish
indians
are
now
generally
on
the
coast
as
they
find
it
much
easier
to
live
there
than
in
their
own
country
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
they
make
in
their
own
country
is
taken
from
them
by
the
coast
indians
so
that
there
is
little
inducement
for
them
to
remain
the
lewes
river
where
it
leaves
marsh
lake
is
about
yards
wide
and
averages
this
width
as
far
as
the
cañon
i
did
not
try
to
find
bottom
anywhere
as
i
went
along
except
where
i
had
reason
to
think
it
shallow
and
there
i
always
tried
with
my
paddle
i
did
not
anywhere
find
bottom
with
this
which
shows
that
there
is
no
part
of
this
stretch
of
the
river
with
less
than
six
feet
of
water
at
medium
height
at
which
stage
it
appeared
to
me
the
river
was
at
that
time
from
the
head
of
lake
bennet
to
the
cañon
the
corrected
distance
is
miles
all
of
which
is
navigable
for
boats
drawing
feet
or
more
add
to
this
the
westerly
arm
of
lake
bennet
and
the
takone
or
windy
arm
of
tagish
lake
each
about
fifteen
miles
in
length
and
the
taku
arm
of
the
latter
lake
of
unknown
length
but
probably
not
less
than
thirty
miles
and
we
have
a
stretch
of
water
of
upwards
of
one
hundred
miles
in
length
all
easily
navigable
and
as
has
been
pointed
out
easily
connected
with
taiya
inlet
through
the
white
pass
no
streams
of
any
importance
enter
any
of
these
lakes
so
far
as
i
know
a
river
called
by
schwatka
mcclintock
river
enters
marsh
lake
at
the
lower
end
from
the
east
it
occupies
a
large
valley
as
seen
from
the
westerly
side
of
the
lake
but
the
stream
is
apparently
unimportant
another
small
stream
apparently
only
a
creek
enters
the
angle
of
the
lake
it
is
not
probable
that
any
stream
coming
from
the
east
side
of
the
lake
is
of
importance
as
the
strip
of
country
between
the
lewes
and
teslintoo
is
not
more
than
thirty
or
forty
miles
in
width
at
this
point
the
taku
arm
of
tagish
lake
is
so
far
with
the
exception
of
reports
from
indians
unknown
but
it
is
equally
improbable
that
any
river
of
importance
enters
it
as
it
is
so
near
the
source
of
the
waters
flowing
northwards
however
this
is
a
question
that
can
only
be
decided
by
a
proper
exploration
the
cañon
i
have
already
described
and
will
only
add
that
it
is
of
a
mile
long
about
feet
wide
with
perpendicular
banks
of
basaltic
rock
from
to
feet
high
below
the
cañon
proper
there
is
a
stretch
of
rapids
for
about
a
mile
then
about
half
a
mile
of
smooth
water
following
which
are
the
white
horse
rapids
which
are
of
a
mile
long
and
unsafe
for
boats
the
total
fall
in
the
cañon
and
succeeding
rapids
was
measured
and
found
to
be
feet
were
it
ever
necessary
to
make
this
part
of
the
river
navigable
it
will
be
no
easy
task
to
overcome
the
obstacles
at
this
point
but
a
tram
or
railway
could
with
very
little
difficulty
be
constructed
along
the
east
side
of
the
river
past
the
cañon
for
some
distance
below
the
white
horse
rapids
the
current
is
swift
and
the
river
wide
with
many
gravel
bars
the
reach
between
these
rapids
and
lake
labarge
a
distance
of
and
a
half
miles
is
all
smooth
water
with
a
strong
current
the
average
width
is
about
yards
there
is
no
impediment
to
navigation
other
than
the
swift
current
and
this
is
no
stronger
than
on
the
lower
part
of
the
river
which
is
already
navigated
nor
is
it
worse
than
on
the
saskatchewan
and
red
rivers
in
the
more
eastern
part
of
our
territory
about
midway
in
this
stretch
the
tahkeena
river
joins
the
lewes
this
river
is
apparently
about
half
the
size
of
the
latter
its
waters
are
muddy
indicating
the
passage
through
a
clayey
district
i
got
some
indefinite
information
about
this
river
from
an
indian
who
happened
to
meet
me
just
below
its
mouth
but
i
could
not
readily
make
him
understand
me
and
his
replies
were
a
compound
of
chinook
tagish
and
signs
and
therefore
largely
unintelligible
from
what
i
could
understand
with
any
certainty
the
river
was
easy
to
descend
there
being
no
bad
rapids
and
it
came
out
of
a
lake
much
larger
than
any
i
had
yet
passed
footnote
the
tahkeena
was
formerly
much
used
by
the
chilkat
indians
as
a
means
of
reaching
the
interior
but
never
by
the
miners
owing
to
the
distance
from
the
sea
to
its
head
here
i
may
remark
that
i
have
invariably
found
it
difficult
to
get
reliable
or
definite
information
from
indians
the
reasons
for
this
are
many
most
of
the
indians
it
has
been
my
lot
to
meet
are
expecting
to
make
something
and
consequently
are
very
chary
about
doing
or
saying
anything
unless
they
think
they
will
be
well
rewarded
for
it
they
are
naturally
very
suspicions
of
strangers
and
it
takes
some
time
and
some
knowledge
of
their
language
to
overcome
this
suspicion
and
gain
their
confidence
if
you
begin
at
once
to
ask
questions
about
their
country
without
previously
having
them
understand
that
you
have
no
unfriendly
motive
in
doing
so
they
become
alarmed
and
although
you
may
not
meet
with
a
positive
refusal
to
answer
questions
you
make
very
little
progress
in
getting
desired
information
on
the
other
hand
i
have
met
cases
where
either
through
fear
or
hope
of
reward
they
were
only
too
anxious
to
impart
all
they
knew
or
had
heard
and
even
more
if
they
thought
it
would
please
their
hearer
i
need
hardly
say
that
such
information
is
often
not
at
all
in
accordance
with
the
facts
i
have
several
times
found
that
some
act
of
mine
when
in
their
presence
has
aroused
either
their
fear
superstition
or
cupidity
as
an
instance
on
the
bell
river
i
met
some
indians
coming
down
stream
as
i
was
going
up
we
were
ashore
at
the
time
and
invited
them
to
join
us
they
started
to
come
in
but
very
slowly
and
all
the
time
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
us
i
noticed
that
my
shot
gun
was
lying
at
my
feet
loaded
and
picked
it
up
to
unload
it
as
i
knew
they
would
be
handling
it
after
landing
this
alarmed
them
so
much
that
it
was
some
time
before
they
came
in
and
i
do
think
they
would
have
come
ashore
at
all
had
they
not
heard
that
a
party
of
white
men
of
whom
we
answered
the
description
were
coming
through
that
way
they
had
learned
this
from
the
hudson
bay
company
officers
and
concluded
we
were
the
party
described
to
them
after
drinking
some
of
our
tea
and
getting
a
supply
for
themselves
they
became
quite
friendly
and
communicative
i
cite
these
as
instances
of
what
one
meets
with
who
comes
in
contact
with
indians
and
of
how
trifles
affect
them
a
sojourn
of
two
or
three
days
with
them
and
the
assistance
of
a
common
friend
would
do
much
to
disabuse
them
of
such
ideas
but
when
you
have
no
such
aids
you
must
not
expect
to
make
much
progress
lake
labarge
is
miles
long
in
the
upper
thirteen
it
varies
from
three
to
four
miles
in
width
it
then
narrows
to
about
two
miles
for
a
distance
of
seven
miles
when
it
begins
to
widen
again
and
gradually
expands
to
about
two
and
or
three
miles
the
lower
six
miles
of
it
maintaining
the
latter
width
the
survey
was
carried
along
the
western
shore
and
while
so
engaged
i
determined
the
width
of
the
upper
wide
part
by
triangulation
at
two
points
the
width
of
the
narrow
middle
part
at
three
points
and
the
width
of
the
lower
part
at
three
points
dawson
on
his
way
out
made
a
track
survey
of
the
eastern
shore
the
western
shore
is
irregular
in
many
places
being
indented
by
large
bays
especially
at
the
upper
and
lower
ends
these
bays
are
as
a
rule
shallow
more
especially
those
at
the
lower
end
just
above
where
the
lake
narrows
in
the
middle
there
is
a
large
island
it
is
three
and
miles
long
and
about
half
a
mile
in
width
it
is
shown
on
schwatka
map
as
a
peninsula
and
called
by
him
richtofen
rocks
how
he
came
to
think
it
a
peninsula
i
can
not
understand
as
it
is
well
out
in
the
lake
the
nearest
point
of
it
to
the
western
shore
is
upwards
of
half
a
mile
distant
and
the
extreme
width
of
the
lake
here
is
not
more
than
five
miles
which
includes
the
depth
of
the
deepest
bays
on
the
western
side
it
is
therefore
difficult
to
understand
that
he
did
not
see
it
as
an
island
the
upper
half
of
this
island
is
gravelly
and
does
not
rise
very
high
above
the
lake
the
lower
end
is
rocky
and
high
the
rock
being
of
a
bright
red
color
at
the
lower
end
of
the
lake
there
is
a
large
valley
extending
northwards
which
has
evidently
at
one
time
been
the
outlet
of
the
lake
dawson
has
noted
it
and
its
peculiarities
his
remarks
regarding
it
will
be
found
on
pages
of
his
report
entitled
district
and
northern
portion
of
british
columbia
published
in
the
width
of
the
lewes
river
as
it
leaves
the
lake
is
the
same
as
at
its
entrance
about
yards
its
waters
when
i
was
there
were
murky
this
is
caused
by
the
action
of
the
waves
on
the
shore
along
the
lower
end
of
the
lake
the
water
at
the
upper
end
and
at
the
middle
of
the
lake
is
quite
clear
so
much
so
that
the
bottom
can
be
distinctly
seen
at
a
depth
of
or
feet
the
wind
blows
almost
constantly
down
this
lake
and
in
a
high
wind
it
gets
very
rough
the
miners
complain
of
much
detention
owing
to
this
cause
and
certainly
i
can
not
complain
of
a
lack
of
wind
while
i
was
on
the
lake
this
lake
was
named
after
one
mike
labarge
who
was
engaged
by
the
western
union
telegraph
company
exploring
the
river
and
adjacent
country
for
the
purpose
of
connecting
europe
and
america
by
telegraph
through
british
columbia
and
alaska
and
across
behring
strait
to
asia
and
thence
to
europe
this
exploration
took
place
in
but
it
does
not
appear
that
labarge
then
nor
for
some
years
after
saw
the
lake
called
by
his
name
the
successful
laying
of
the
atlantic
cable
in
put
a
stop
to
this
project
and
the
exploring
parties
sent
out
were
recalled
as
soon
as
word
could
be
got
to
them
it
seems
that
labarge
had
got
up
as
far
as
the
pelly
before
he
received
his
recall
he
had
heard
something
of
a
large
lake
some
distance
further
up
the
river
and
afterwards
spoke
of
it
to
some
traders
and
miners
who
called
it
after
him
after
leaving
lake
labarge
the
river
for
a
distance
of
about
five
miles
preserves
a
generally
uniform
width
and
an
easy
current
of
about
four
miles
per
hour
it
then
makes
a
short
turn
round
a
low
gravel
point
and
flows
in
exactly
the
opposite
of
its
general
course
for
a
mile
when
it
again
turns
sharply
to
its
general
direction
the
current
around
this
curve
and
for
some
distance
below
it
in
all
four
or
five
miles
is
very
swift
i
timed
it
in
several
places
and
found
it
from
six
to
seven
miles
an
hour
it
then
moderates
to
four
or
five
and
continues
so
until
the
teslintoo
river
is
reached
and
seven
tenths
miles
from
lake
labarge
the
average
width
of
this
part
of
the
river
is
about
yards
and
the
depth
is
sufficient
to
afford
passage
for
boats
drawing
at
least
feet
it
is
as
a
rule
crooked
and
consequently
a
little
difficult
to
navigate
the
teslintoo
was
so
called
by
dawson
this
according
to
information
obtained
by
him
being
the
indian
name
it
is
called
by
the
miners
or
hotalinqua
and
was
called
by
schwatka
who
appears
to
have
bestowed
no
other
attention
to
it
the
newberry
although
it
is
apparently
much
larger
than
the
lewes
this
was
so
apparent
that
in
my
interim
reports
i
stated
it
as
a
fact
owing
to
circumstances
already
narrated
i
had
not
time
while
at
the
mouth
to
make
any
measurement
to
determine
the
relative
size
of
the
rivers
but
on
his
way
out
dawson
made
these
measurements
and
his
report
before
referred
to
gives
the
following
values
of
the
cross
sections
of
each
stream
lewes
feet
teslintoo
feet
in
the
same
connection
he
states
that
the
lewes
appeared
to
be
about
foot
above
its
lowest
summer
level
while
the
teslintoo
appeared
to
be
at
its
lowest
level
assuming
this
to
be
so
and
taking
his
widths
as
our
data
it
would
reduce
his
cross
section
of
the
lewes
to
feet
owing
however
to
the
current
in
the
lewes
as
determined
by
dawson
being
just
double
that
of
the
teslintoo
the
figures
being
and
miles
per
hour
respectively
the
discharge
of
the
lewes
taking
these
figures
again
in
feet
and
of
the
teslintoo
feet
to
reduce
the
lewes
to
its
lowest
level
the
doctor
says
would
make
its
discharge
feet
footnote
the
limited
amount
of
prospecting
that
has
been
done
on
this
river
is
said
to
be
very
satisfactory
fine
gold
having
been
found
in
all
parts
of
the
river
the
lack
of
supplies
is
the
great
drawback
to
its
development
and
this
will
not
be
overcome
to
any
extent
until
by
some
means
heavy
freight
can
be
brought
over
the
coast
range
to
the
head
of
the
river
indeed
owing
to
the
difficulties
attending
access
and
transportation
the
great
drawback
to
the
entire
yukon
district
at
present
is
the
want
of
heavy
mining
machinery
and
the
scarcity
of
supplies
the
government
being
aware
of
the
requirements
and
possibilities
of
the
country
has
undertaken
the
task
of
making
preliminary
surveys
for
trails
and
railroads
and
no
doubt
in
the
near
future
the
avenue
for
better
and
quicker
transportation
facilities
will
be
opened
up
the
water
of
the
teslintoo
is
of
a
dark
brown
color
similar
in
appearance
to
the
ottawa
river
water
and
a
little
turbid
notwithstanding
the
difference
of
volume
of
discharge
the
teslintoo
changes
completely
the
character
of
the
river
below
the
junction
and
a
person
coming
up
the
river
would
at
the
forks
unhesitatingly
pronounce
the
teslintoo
the
main
stream
the
water
of
the
lewes
is
blue
in
color
and
at
the
time
i
speak
of
was
somewhat
dirty
not
enough
so
however
to
prevent
one
seeing
to
a
depth
of
two
or
three
feet
at
the
junction
of
the
lewes
and
teslintoo
i
met
two
or
three
families
of
the
indians
who
hunt
in
the
vicinity
one
of
them
could
speak
a
little
chinook
as
i
had
two
men
with
me
who
understood
his
jargon
perfectly
with
their
assistance
i
tried
to
get
some
information
from
him
about
the
river
he
told
me
the
river
was
easy
to
ascend
and
presented
the
same
appearance
eight
days
journey
up
as
at
the
mouth
then
a
lake
was
reached
which
took
one
day
to
cross
the
river
was
then
followed
again
for
half
a
day
to
another
lake
which
took
two
days
to
traverse
into
this
lake
emptied
a
stream
which
they
used
as
a
highway
to
the
coast
passing
by
way
of
the
taku
river
he
said
it
took
four
days
when
they
had
loads
to
carry
from
the
head
of
canoe
navigation
on
the
teslintoo
to
salt
water
on
the
taku
inlet
but
when
they
come
light
they
take
only
one
to
two
days
he
spoke
also
of
a
stream
entering
the
large
lake
from
the
east
which
came
from
a
distance
but
they
did
not
seem
to
know
much
about
it
and
considered
it
outside
their
country
if
their
time
intervals
are
approximately
accurate
they
mean
that
there
are
about
miles
of
good
river
to
the
first
lake
as
they
ought
easily
to
make
miles
a
day
on
the
river
as
i
saw
it
the
lake
takes
one
day
to
traverse
and
is
at
least
miles
long
followed
by
say
of
river
which
brings
us
to
the
large
lake
which
takes
two
days
to
cross
say
or
more
in
all
about
miles
say
to
the
head
of
canoe
navigation
while
the
distance
from
the
head
of
lake
bennet
to
the
junction
is
only
assuming
the
course
of
the
teslintoo
to
be
nearly
south
it
is
a
little
to
the
east
of
it
and
throwing
out
every
fourth
mile
for
bends
the
remainder
gives
us
in
arc
three
degrees
and
a
quarter
of
latitude
which
deducted
from
the
latitude
of
the
junction
gives
us
or
nearly
the
latitude
of
juneau
to
make
sure
that
i
understood
the
indian
aright
and
that
he
knew
what
he
was
speaking
about
i
got
him
to
sketch
the
river
and
lake
as
he
described
them
on
the
sand
and
repeat
the
same
several
times
i
afterwards
met
boswell
his
brother
and
another
miner
who
had
spent
most
of
the
summer
on
the
river
prospecting
and
from
them
i
gathered
the
following
the
distance
to
the
first
and
only
lake
which
they
saw
they
put
at
miles
and
the
lake
itself
they
call
at
least
miles
long
as
it
took
them
four
days
to
row
in
a
light
boat
from
end
to
end
the
portage
to
the
sea
they
did
not
appear
to
know
anything
about
but
describe
a
large
bay
on
the
east
side
of
the
lake
into
which
a
river
of
considerable
size
entered
this
river
occupies
a
wide
valley
surrounded
by
high
mountains
they
thought
this
river
must
head
near
liard
river
this
account
differs
materially
from
that
given
by
the
indian
and
to
put
them
on
their
guard
i
told
them
what
he
had
told
me
but
they
still
persisted
in
their
story
which
i
find
differs
a
good
deal
from
the
account
they
gave
dawson
as
incorporated
in
his
report
many
years
ago
sixteen
i
think
a
man
named
monroe
prospected
up
the
taku
and
learned
from
the
indians
something
of
a
large
lake
not
far
from
that
river
he
crossed
over
and
found
it
and
spent
some
time
in
prospecting
and
then
recrossed
to
the
sea
this
man
had
been
at
forty
mile
river
and
i
heard
from
the
miners
there
his
account
of
the
appearance
of
the
lake
which
amounted
generally
to
this
the
boswells
did
not
know
anything
about
it
it
was
unfortunate
the
boswells
did
not
remain
at
forty
mile
all
winter
as
by
a
comparison
of
recollections
they
might
have
arrived
at
some
correct
conclusion
conflicting
as
these
descriptions
are
one
thing
is
certain
this
branch
if
it
has
not
the
greater
discharge
is
the
longer
and
more
important
of
the
two
and
offers
easy
and
uninterrupted
navigation
for
more
than
double
the
distance
which
the
lewes
does
the
cañon
being
only
ninety
miles
above
the
mouth
of
the
teslintoo
the
boswells
reported
it
as
containing
much
more
useful
timber
than
the
lewes
which
indeed
one
would
infer
from
its
lower
altitude
assuming
this
as
the
main
river
and
adding
its
length
to
the
below
the
junction
gives
upward
of
miles
of
river
fully
of
which
runs
through
a
very
mountainous
country
without
an
impediment
to
navigation
some
indefinite
information
was
obtained
as
to
the
position
of
this
river
in
the
neighborhood
of
marsh
lake
tending
to
show
that
the
distance
between
them
was
only
about
thirty
or
forty
miles
between
the
teslintoo
and
the
big
salmon
so
called
by
the
miners
or
by
schwatka
the
distance
is
and
miles
in
which
the
lewes
preserves
a
generally
uniform
width
and
current
for
a
few
miles
below
the
teslintoo
it
is
a
little
over
the
ordinary
width
but
then
contracts
to
about
two
hundred
yards
which
it
maintains
with
little
variation
the
current
is
generally
from
four
to
five
miles
per
hour
the
big
salmon
i
found
to
be
about
one
hundred
yards
wide
near
the
mouth
the
depth
not
more
than
four
or
five
feet
and
the
current
so
far
as
could
be
seen
sluggish
none
of
the
miners
i
met
could
give
me
any
information
concerning
this
stream
but
dawson
was
more
fortunate
and
met
a
man
who
had
spent
most
of
the
summer
of
prospecting
on
it
his
opinion
was
that
it
might
be
navigable
for
small
steamers
for
many
miles
the
valley
as
seen
from
the
mouth
is
wide
and
gives
one
the
impression
of
being
occupied
by
a
much
more
important
stream
looking
up
it
in
the
distance
could
be
seen
many
high
peaks
covered
with
snow
as
the
date
was
august
it
is
likely
they
are
always
so
covered
which
would
make
their
probable
altitude
above
the
river
feet
or
more
dawson
in
his
report
incorporates
fully
the
notes
obtained
from
the
miners
i
will
trespass
so
far
on
these
as
to
say
that
they
called
the
distance
to
a
small
lake
near
the
head
of
the
river
miles
from
the
mouth
this
lake
was
estimated
to
be
four
miles
in
length
another
lake
about
miles
above
this
was
estimated
to
be
miles
long
and
its
upper
end
distant
only
about
eight
miles
from
the
teslintoo
these
distances
if
correct
make
this
river
much
more
important
than
a
casual
glance
at
it
would
indicate
this
however
will
be
more
fully
spoken
of
under
its
proper
head
just
below
the
big
salmon
the
lewes
takes
a
bend
of
nearly
a
right
angle
its
course
from
the
junction
with
the
tahkeena
to
this
point
is
generally
a
little
east
of
north
at
this
point
it
turns
to
nearly
west
for
some
distance
its
course
between
here
and
its
confluence
with
the
pelly
is
and
i
may
add
it
preserves
this
general
direction
down
to
the
confluence
with
the
porcupine
the
river
also
changes
in
another
respect
it
is
generally
wider
and
often
expands
into
what
might
be
called
lakes
in
which
are
islands
some
of
the
lakes
are
of
considerable
length
and
well
timbered
to
determine
which
channel
is
the
main
one
that
is
which
carries
the
greatest
volume
of
water
or
is
best
available
for
the
purposes
of
navigation
among
these
islands
would
require
more
time
than
i
could
devote
to
it
on
my
way
down
consequently
i
can
not
say
more
than
that
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
that
a
channel
giving
six
feet
or
more
of
water
could
easily
be
found
whenever
in
the
main
channel
i
had
reason
to
think
the
water
shallow
i
tried
it
with
my
paddle
but
always
failed
to
find
bottom
which
gives
upward
of
six
feet
of
course
i
often
found
less
than
this
but
not
in
what
i
considered
the
main
channel
and
a
quarter
miles
below
the
big
salmon
the
little
salmon
the
daly
of
schwatka
enters
the
lewes
this
river
is
about
yards
wide
at
the
mouth
and
not
more
than
two
or
three
feet
in
depth
the
water
is
clear
and
of
a
brownish
hue
there
is
not
much
current
at
the
mouth
nor
as
far
as
can
be
seen
up
the
stream
the
valley
which
from
the
mouth
does
not
appear
extensive
bears
for
some
distance
when
it
appears
to
turn
more
to
the
east
six
or
seven
miles
up
and
apparently
on
the
north
side
some
high
cliffs
of
red
rock
apparently
granite
can
be
seen
it
is
said
that
some
miners
have
prospected
this
stream
but
i
could
learn
nothing
definite
about
it
lewes
river
makes
a
turn
here
to
the
and
runs
in
that
direction
six
miles
when
it
again
turns
to
the
for
seven
miles
and
then
makes
a
short
sharp
turn
to
the
south
and
west
around
a
low
sandy
point
which
will
at
some
day
in
the
near
future
be
cut
through
by
the
current
which
will
shorten
the
river
three
or
four
miles
eight
miles
below
little
salmon
river
a
large
rock
called
the
nest
stands
up
in
a
gravel
slope
on
the
easterly
bank
of
the
river
it
rises
about
five
hundred
feet
above
the
river
and
is
composed
of
a
light
gray
stone
what
the
character
of
this
rock
is
i
could
not
observe
as
i
saw
it
only
from
the
river
which
is
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
on
the
westerly
side
of
the
river
there
are
two
or
three
other
isolated
masses
of
apparently
the
same
kind
of
rock
one
of
them
might
be
appropriately
called
a
mountain
it
is
from
the
eagle
nest
and
distant
from
it
about
three
miles
miles
below
eagle
nest
rock
nordenskiold
river
enters
from
the
west
it
is
an
unimportant
stream
being
not
more
than
one
hundred
and
twenty
feet
wide
at
the
mouth
and
only
a
few
inches
deep
the
valley
as
far
as
can
be
seen
is
not
extensive
and
being
very
crooked
it
is
hard
to
tell
what
its
general
direction
is
the
lewes
between
the
little
salmon
and
the
nordenskiold
maintains
a
width
of
from
two
to
three
hundred
yards
with
an
occasional
expansion
where
there
are
islands
it
is
serpentine
in
its
course
most
of
the
way
and
where
the
nordenskiold
joins
it
is
very
crooked
running
several
times
under
a
hill
named
by
schwatka
tantalus
butte
and
in
other
places
leaving
it
for
a
distance
of
eight
miles
the
distance
across
from
point
to
point
is
only
half
a
mile
below
this
to
five
finger
rapids
from
the
fact
that
five
large
masses
of
rock
stand
in
the
river
assumes
its
ordinary
straightness
and
width
with
a
current
from
four
to
five
miles
per
hour
i
have
already
described
five
finger
rapids
i
do
not
think
they
will
prove
anything
more
than
a
slight
obstruction
in
the
navigation
of
the
river
a
boat
of
ordinary
power
would
probably
have
to
help
herself
up
with
windlass
and
line
in
high
water
below
the
rapids
for
about
two
miles
the
current
is
strong
probably
six
miles
per
hour
but
the
water
seems
to
be
deep
enough
for
any
boat
that
is
likely
to
navigate
it
six
miles
below
this
as
already
noticed
rink
rapids
are
situated
they
are
of
no
great
importance
the
westerly
half
of
the
stream
only
being
obstructed
the
easterly
half
is
not
in
any
way
affected
the
current
being
smooth
and
the
water
deep
below
five
finger
rapids
about
two
miles
a
small
stream
enters
from
the
east
it
is
called
by
dawson
tatshun
river
it
is
not
more
than
or
feet
wide
at
the
mouth
and
contains
only
a
little
clear
brownish
water
here
i
met
the
only
indians
seen
on
the
river
between
teslintoo
and
stewart
rivers
they
were
engaged
in
catching
salmon
at
the
mouth
of
the
tatshun
and
were
the
poorest
and
most
unintelligent
indians
it
has
ever
been
my
lot
to
meet
it
is
needless
to
say
that
none
of
our
party
understood
anything
they
said
as
they
could
not
speak
a
word
of
any
language
but
their
own
i
tried
by
signs
to
get
some
information
from
them
about
the
stream
they
were
fishing
in
but
failed
i
tried
in
the
same
way
to
learn
if
there
were
any
more
indians
in
the
vicinity
but
again
utterly
failed
i
then
tried
by
signs
to
find
out
how
many
days
it
took
to
go
down
to
pelly
river
but
although
i
have
never
known
these
signs
to
fail
in
eliciting
information
in
any
other
part
of
the
territory
they
did
not
understand
they
appeared
to
be
alarmed
by
our
presence
and
as
we
had
not
yet
been
assured
as
to
the
rumor
concerning
the
trouble
between
the
miners
and
indians
we
felt
a
little
apprehensive
but
being
able
to
learn
nothing
from
them
we
had
to
put
our
fears
aside
and
proceed
blindly
between
five
finger
rapids
and
pelly
river
and
a
no
streams
of
any
importance
enter
the
lewes
in
fact
with
the
exception
of
the
tatshun
it
may
be
said
that
none
at
all
enter
about
a
mile
below
rink
rapids
the
river
spreads
out
into
a
expanse
with
many
islands
this
continues
for
about
three
miles
when
it
contracts
to
something
like
the
usual
width
but
bars
and
small
islands
are
very
numerous
all
the
way
to
pelly
river
about
five
miles
above
pelly
river
there
is
another
expanse
filled
with
islands
the
river
here
for
three
or
four
miles
is
nearly
a
mile
wide
and
so
numerous
and
close
are
the
islands
that
it
is
impossible
to
tell
when
floating
among
them
where
the
shores
of
the
river
are
the
current
too
is
swift
leading
one
to
suppose
the
water
shallow
but
i
think
even
here
a
channel
deep
enough
for
such
boats
as
will
navigate
this
part
of
the
river
can
be
found
schwatka
named
this
group
of
islands
ingersoll
islands
at
the
mouth
of
the
pelly
the
lewes
is
about
half
a
mile
wide
and
here
too
there
are
many
islands
but
not
in
groups
as
at
ingersoll
islands
about
a
mile
below
the
pelly
just
at
the
ruins
of
fort
selkirk
the
yukon
was
found
to
be
yards
wide
about
being
ten
feet
deep
with
a
current
of
about
four
and
miles
per
hour
the
remaining
third
was
more
than
half
taken
up
by
a
bar
and
the
current
between
it
and
the
south
shore
was
very
slack
pelly
river
at
its
mouth
is
about
two
hundred
yards
wide
and
continues
this
width
as
far
up
as
could
be
seen
dawson
made
a
survey
and
examination
of
this
river
which
will
be
found
in
his
report
already
cited
yukon
district
and
northern
british
columbia
just
here
for
a
short
distance
the
course
of
the
yukon
is
nearly
west
and
on
the
south
side
about
a
mile
below
the
mouth
of
the
lewes
stands
all
that
remains
of
the
only
trading
post
ever
built
by
white
men
in
the
district
this
post
was
established
by
robert
campbell
for
the
bay
company
in
the
summer
of
it
was
first
built
on
the
point
of
land
between
the
two
rivers
but
this
location
proving
untenable
on
account
of
flooding
by
ice
jams
in
the
spring
it
was
in
the
season
of
moved
across
the
river
to
where
the
ruins
now
stand
it
appears
that
the
houses
composing
the
post
were
not
finished
when
the
indians
from
the
coast
on
chilkat
and
chilkoot
inlets
came
down
the
river
to
put
a
stop
to
the
competitive
trade
which
campbell
had
inaugurated
and
which
they
found
to
seriously
interfere
with
their
profits
their
method
of
trade
appears
to
have
been
then
pretty
much
as
it
is
now
very
onesided
what
they
found
it
convenient
to
take
by
force
they
took
and
what
it
was
convenient
to
pay
for
at
their
own
price
they
paid
for
rumors
had
reached
the
post
that
the
coast
indians
contemplated
such
a
raid
and
in
consequence
the
native
indians
in
the
vicinity
remained
about
nearly
all
summer
unfortunately
they
went
away
for
a
short
time
and
during
their
absence
the
coast
indians
arrived
in
the
early
morning
and
surprised
campbell
in
bed
they
were
not
at
all
rough
with
him
but
gave
him
the
privilege
of
leaving
the
place
within
hours
after
which
he
was
informed
that
he
was
liable
to
be
shot
if
seen
by
them
in
the
locality
they
then
pillaged
the
place
and
set
fire
to
it
leaving
nothing
but
the
remains
of
the
two
chimneys
which
are
still
standing
this
raid
and
capture
took
place
on
the
august
campbell
dropped
down
the
river
and
met
some
of
the
local
indians
who
returned
with
him
but
the
robbers
had
made
their
escape
i
have
heard
that
the
local
indians
wished
to
pursue
and
overtake
them
but
to
this
campbell
would
not
consent
had
they
done
so
it
is
probable
not
many
of
the
raiders
would
have
escaped
as
the
superior
local
knowledge
of
the
natives
would
have
given
them
an
advantage
difficult
to
estimate
and
the
confidence
and
spirit
derived
from
the
aid
and
presence
of
a
white
man
or
two
would
be
worth
much
in
such
a
conflict
campbell
went
on
down
the
river
until
he
met
the
outfit
for
his
post
on
its
way
up
from
fort
yukon
which
he
turned
back
he
then
ascended
the
pelly
crossed
to
the
liard
and
reached
fort
simpson
on
the
mackenzie
late
in
october
campbell
first
visit
to
the
site
of
fort
selkirk
was
made
in
under
instructions
from
sir
george
simpson
then
governor
of
the
hudson
bay
company
he
crossed
from
the
head
waters
of
the
liard
to
the
waters
of
the
pelly
it
appears
the
pelly
where
he
struck
it
was
a
stream
of
considerable
size
for
he
speaks
of
its
appearance
when
he
first
saw
it
from
banks
the
name
given
the
bank
from
which
he
first
beheld
it
as
a
river
in
the
distance
in
june
he
descended
the
pelly
to
its
confluence
with
the
larger
stream
which
he
named
the
here
he
found
many
families
of
the
native
indians
indians
he
called
them
these
people
conveyed
to
him
as
best
they
could
by
word
and
sign
the
dangers
that
would
attend
a
further
descent
of
the
river
representing
that
the
country
below
theirs
was
inhabited
by
a
tribe
of
fierce
cannibals
who
would
assuredly
kill
and
eat
them
this
so
terrified
his
men
that
he
had
to
return
by
the
way
he
came
pursued
as
he
afterwards
learned
by
the
indians
who
would
have
murdered
himself
and
party
had
they
got
a
favorable
opportunity
thus
it
was
not
until
that
he
could
establish
what
he
says
he
all
along
believed
the
pelly
and
yukon
were
identical
this
he
did
by
descending
the
river
to
where
the
porcupine
joins
it
and
where
in
fort
yukon
was
established
by
murray
for
the
hudson
bay
company
with
reference
to
the
tales
told
him
by
the
indians
of
bad
people
outside
of
their
country
i
may
say
that
mackenzie
tells
pretty
much
the
same
story
of
the
indians
on
the
mackenzie
when
he
discovered
and
explored
that
river
in
he
had
the
advantage
of
having
indians
along
with
him
whose
language
was
radically
the
same
as
that
of
the
people
he
was
coming
among
and
his
statements
are
more
explicit
and
detailed
everywhere
he
came
in
contact
with
them
they
manifested
first
dread
of
himself
and
party
and
when
friendship
and
confidence
were
established
they
nearly
always
tried
to
detain
him
by
representing
the
people
in
the
direction
he
was
going
as
unnaturally
bloodthirsty
and
cruel
sometimes
asserting
the
existence
of
monsters
with
supernatural
powers
as
at
manitou
island
a
few
miles
below
the
present
fort
good
hope
and
the
people
on
a
very
large
river
far
to
the
west
of
the
mackenzie
probably
the
yukon
they
described
to
him
as
monsters
in
size
power
and
cruelty
in
our
own
time
after
the
intercourse
that
there
has
been
between
them
and
the
whites
more
than
a
suspicion
of
such
unknown
cruel
people
lurks
in
the
minds
of
many
of
the
indians
it
would
be
futile
for
me
to
try
to
ascribe
an
origin
for
these
fears
my
knowledge
of
their
language
and
idiosyncrasies
being
so
limited
nothing
more
was
ever
done
in
the
vicinity
of
fort
selkirk
by
the
hudson
bay
company
after
these
events
and
in
the
company
was
ordered
by
capt
charles
raymond
who
represented
the
united
states
government
to
evacuate
the
post
at
fort
yukon
he
having
found
that
it
was
west
of
the
meridian
the
post
was
occupied
by
the
company
however
for
some
time
after
the
receipt
of
this
order

was
built

was

company
better
known
in
the
yukon
valley
as
captain
healy
company
has
established
a
number
of
posts
on
the
river
on
many
maps
of
alaska
a
place
named
house
is
shown
on
or
near
the
upper
waters
of
stewart
river
i
made
enquiries
of
all
whom
i
thought
likely
to
know
anything
concerning
this
post
but
failed
to
elicit
any
information
showing
that
there
ever
had
been
such
a
place
i
enquired
of
reid
who
was
in
the
company
service
with
campbell
at
fort
selkirk
and
after
whom
i
thought
possibly
the
place
had
been
called
but
he
told
me
he
knew
of
no
such
post
but
that
there
was
a
small
lake
at
some
distance
in
a
northerly
direction
from
fort
selkirk
where
fish
were
procured
a
sort
of
shelter
had
been
made
at
that
point
for
the
fishermen
and
a
few
furs
might
have
been
obtained
there
but
it
was
never
regarded
as
a
trading
post
below
fort
selkirk
the
yukon
river
is
from
five
to
six
hundred
yards
broad
and
maintains
this
width
down
to
white
river
a
distance
of
miles
islands
are
numerous
so
much
so
that
there
are
very
few
parts
of
the
river
where
there
are
not
one
or
more
in
sight
many
of
them
are
of
considerable
size
and
nearly
all
are
well
timbered
bars
are
also
numerous
but
almost
all
are
composed
of
gravel
so
that
navigators
will
not
have
to
complain
of
shifting
sand
bars
the
current
as
a
general
thing
is
not
so
rapid
as
in
the
upper
part
of
the
river
averaging
about
four
miles
per
hour
the
depth
in
the
main
channel
was
always
found
to
be
more
than
six
feet
from
pelly
river
to
within
twelve
miles
of
white
river
the
general
course
of
the
river
is
a
little
north
of
west
it
then
turns
to
the
north
and
the
general
course
as
far
as
the
site
of
fort
reliance
is
due
north
white
river
enters
the
main
river
from
the
west
at
the
mouth
it
is
about
two
hundred
yards
wide
but
a
great
part
of
it
is
filled
with
the
main
volume
of
water
being
confined
to
a
channel
not
more
than
one
hundred
yards
in
width
the
current
is
very
strong
certainly
not
less
than
eight
miles
per
hour
the
color
of
the
water
bears
witness
to
this
as
it
is
much
the
muddiest
that
i
have
ever
seen
footnote
the
white
river
very
probably
flows
over
volcanic
deposits
as
its
sediments
would
indicate
no
doubt
this
would
account
for
the
discoloration
of
its
waters
the
volcanic
ash
appears
to
cover
a
great
extent
of
the
upper
yukon
basin
drained
by
the
lewes
and
pelly
rivers
very
full
treatment
of
the
subject
is
given
by
dawson
in
his
report
entitled
yukon
district
and
northern
portion
of
british
columbia
i
had
intended
to
make
a
survey
of
part
of
this
river
as
far
as
the
international
boundary
and
attempted
to
do
so
but
after
trying
for
over
half
a
day
i
found
it
would
be
a
task
of
much
labor
and
time
altogether
out
of
proportion
to
the
importance
of
the
end
sought
and
therefore
abandoned

as
far
as
can
be

about

then
appears
to
bear
to
the
it
is
about
two
miles
wide
where
it
joins
the
pelly
valley
and
apparently
keeps
the
same
width
as
far
as
it
can
be
seen
harper
of
the
firm
of
harper
ladue
went
up
this
river
with
sleds
in
the
fall
of
a
distance
of
fifty
or
sixty
miles
he
describes
it
as
possessing
the
same
general
features
all
the
way
up
with
much
clay
soil
along
its
banks
its
general
course
as
sketched
by
him
on
a
map
of
mine
is
for
a
distance
of
about
thirty
miles
a
little
thence
thirty
or
miles
when
it
deflects
to
the
running
along
the
base
of
a
high
mountain
ridge
if
the
courses
given
are
correct
it
must
rise
somewhere
near
the
head
of
forty
mile
river
and
if
so
its
length
is
not
at
all
in
keeping
with
the
volume
of
its
discharge
when
compared
with
the
known
length
and
discharge
of
other
rivers
in
the
territory
harper
mentioned
an
extensive
flat
south
of
the
mountain
range
spoken
of
across
which
many
high
mountain
peaks
could
be
seen
one
of
these
he
thought
must
be
mount
elias
as
it
overtopped
all
the
others
but
as
mount
elias
is
about
one
hundred
and
eighty
miles
distant
his
conclusion
is
not
tenable
from
his
description
of
this
mountain
it
must
be
more
than
twice
the
height
of
the
highest
peaks
seen
anywhere
on
the
lower
river
and
consequently
must
be
ten
or
twelve
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
he
stated
that
the
current
in
the
river
was
very
swift
as
far
as
he
ascended
and
the
water
muddy
the
water
from
this
river
though
probably
not
a
fourth
of
the
volume
of
the
yukon
discolors
the
water
of
the
latter
completely
and
a
couple
of
miles
below
the
junction
the
whole
river
appears
almost
as
dirty
as

ten
miles
the
river
spreads
out
to
a

and
upwards

of
islands
and
bars
the
survey
was
carried
down
the
easterly
shore
and

passed
through

afforded
water
enough
to

while
at

i
was
fortunate
enough
to
meet
a
miner
who
had
spent
the
whole
of
the
summer
of
on
the
river
and
its
branches
prospecting
and
exploring
he
gave
me
a
good
deal
of
information
of
which
i
give
a
summary
he
is
a
native
of
new
brunswick
alexander
mcdonald
by
name
and
has
spent
some
years
mining
in
other
places
but
was
very
reticent
about
what
he
had
made
or
found
sixty
or
seventy
miles
up
the
stewart
a
large
creek
enters
from
the
south
which
he
called
rose
bud
creek
or
river
and
thirty
or
forty
miles
further
up
a
considerable
stream
flows
from
the
which
appears
to
be
beaver
river
as
marked
on
the
maps
of
that
part
of
the
country
from
the
head
of
this
stream
he
floated
down
on
a
raft
taking
five
days
to
do
so
he
estimated
his
progress
at
forty
or
fifty
miles
each
day
which
gives
a
length
of
from
two
hundred
to
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
this
is
probably
an
unless
the
stream
is
very
crooked
which
he
stated
was
not
the
case
as
much
of
his
time
would
be
taken
up
in
prospecting
i
should
call
thirty
miles
or
less
a
closer
estimate
of
his
progress
this
river
is
from
fifty
to
eighty
yards
wide
and
was
never
more
than
four
or
five
feet
deep
often
being
not
more
than
two
or
three
the
current
he
said
was
not
at
all
swift
above
the
mouth
of
this
stream
the
main
river
is
from
one
hundred
to
one
hundred
and
thirty
yards
wide
with
an
even
current
and
clear
water
sixty
or
seventy
miles
above
the
branch
another
large
branch
joins
which
is
possibly
the
main
river
at
the
head
of
it
he
found
a
lake
nearly
thirty
miles
long
and
averaging
a
mile
and
a
half
in
width
which
he
called
mayhew
lake
after
one
of
the
partners
in
the
firm
of
harper
mcquestion
thirty
miles
or
so
above
the
forks
on
the
other
branch
there
are
falls
which
mcdonald
estimated
to
be
from
one
to
two
hundred
feet
in
height
i
met
several
parties
who
had
seen
these
falls
and
they
corroborate
this
estimate
of
their
height
mcdonald
went
on
past
the
falls
to
the
head
of
this
branch
and
found
terraced
gravel
hills
to
the
west
and
north
he
crossed
them
to
the
north
and
found
a
river
flowing
northward
on
this
he
embarked
on
a
raft
and
floated
down
it
for
a
day
or
two
thinking
it
would
turn
to
the
west
and
join
the
stewart
but
finding
it
still
continuing
north
and
acquiring
too
much
volume
to
be
any
of
the
branches
he
had
seen
while
passing
up
the
stewart
he
returned
to
the
point
of
his
departure
and
after
prospecting
among
the
hills
around
the
head
of
the
river
he
started
westward
crossing
a
high
range
of
mountains
composed
principally
of
shales
with
many
thin
seams
of
what
he
called
quartz
ranging
from
one
to
six
inches
in
thickness
on
the
west
side
of
this
range
he
found
a
river
flowing
out
of
what
he
called
mayhew
lake
and
crossing
this
got
to
the
head
of
beaver
river
which
he
descended
as
before
mentioned
it
is
probable
the
river
flowing
northwards
on
which
he
made
a
journey
and
returned
was
a
branch
of
peel
river
he
described
the
timber
on
the
gravel
terraces
of
the
watershed
as
small
and
open
he
was
alone
in
this
unknown
wilderness
all
summer
not
seeing
even
any
of
the
natives
there
are
few
men
so
constituted
as
to
be
capable
of
isolating
themselves
in
such
a
manner
judging
from
all
i
could
learn
it
is
probable
a
steamboat
could
navigate
nearly
all
of
stewart
iver
and
its
tributaries
from
stewart
river
to
the
site
of
fort
reliance

three
quarters
of

but
there
are
many
expansions
where
it
is
over
a
mile
in
breadth
however
in
these
places
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
waterway
is
wider
than
at
other
parts
of
the
river
the
islands
being
so
large

numerous
in

the

i
received

has
a
station
here
which
was
for
some
years
in
charge
of
mcquestion
there
are
also
several
blacksmith
shops
restaurants
billiard
halls
bakeries
an
opera
house
and
so
on
rather
more
than
half
a
mile
below
forty
mile
townsite
the
town
of
cudahy
was
founded
on
the
north
side
of
forty
mile
river
in
the
summer
of
it
is
named
after
a
well
known
member
of
the
north
american
transportation
and
trading
company
in
population
and
extent
of
business
the
town
bears
comparison
with
its
neighbor
across
the
river
the
opposition
in
trade
has
been
the
means
of
very
materially
reducing
the
cost
of
supplies
and
living
the
north
american
transportation
and
trading
company
has
erected
a
and
some
large
warehouses
fort
constantine
was
established
here
immediately
upon
the
arrival
of
the
mounted
police
detachment
in
the
latter
part
of
july
it
is
described
further
on
in
an
extract
from
inspector
constantine
supplementary
report
for
the
year
forty
mile
river
is
one
hundred
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
wide
at
the
mouth
and
the
current
is
generally
strong
with
many
small
rapids
eight
miles
up
is
the
cañon
it
is
hardly
entitled
to
that
distinctive
name
being
simply
a
crooked
contraction
of
the
river
with
steep
rocky
banks
and
on
the
north
side
there
is
plenty
of
room
to
walk
along
the
beach
at
the
lower
end
of
the
cañon
there
is
a
short
turn
and
swift
water
in
which
are
some
large
rocks
these
can
not
generally
be
seen
and
there
is
much
danger
of
striking
them
running
down
in
a
boat
at
this
point
several
miners
have
been
drowned
by
their
boats
being
upset
in
collision
with
these
rocks
it
is
no
great
distance
to
either
shore
and
one
would
think
an
ordinary
swimmer
would
have
no
difficulty
in
reaching
land
but
the
coldness
of
the
water
soon
benumbs
a
man
completely
and
renders
him
powerless
in
the
summer
of
an
indian
from
tanana
with
his
family
was
coming
down
to
trade
at
the
post
at
the
mouth
of
forty
mile
river
his
canoe
struck
on
these
rocks
and
upset
and
he
was
thrown
clear
of
the
canoe
but
the
woman
and
children
clung
to
it
in
the
rough
water
he
lost
sight
of
them
and
concluded
that
they
were
lost
it
is
said
he
deliberately
drew
his
knife
and
cut
his
throat
thus
perishing
while
his
family
were
hauled
ashore
by
some
miners
the
chief
of
the
band
to
which
this
indian
belonged
came
to
the
post
and
demanded
pay
for
his
loss
which
he
contended
was
occasioned
by
the
traders
having
moved
from
belle
isle
to
forty
mile
thus
causing
them
to
descend
this
dangerous
rapid
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
had
there
not
been
so
many
white
men
in
the
vicinity
he
would
have
tried
to
enforce
his
demand
the
length
of
the
cañon
is
about
a
mile
above
it
the
river
up
to
the
boundary
is
generally
smooth
with
swift
current
and
an
occasional
ripple
the
amount
of
water
discharged
by
this
stream
is
considerable
but
there
is
no
prospect
of
navigation
it
being
so
swift
and
broken
by
small
rapids
from
forty
mile
river
to
the
boundary
the
yukon
preserves
the
same
general
character
as
between
fort
reliance
and
forty
mile
the
greatest
width
being
about
half
a
mile
and
the
least
about
a
quarter
fifteen
miles
below
forty
mile
river
a
large
mass
of
rock
stands
on
the
east
bank
this
was
named
by
schwatka
rock
but
is
known
to
the
traders
as
old
woman
rock
a
similar
mass
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
being
known
as
old
man
rock
the
origin
of
these
names
is
an
indian
legend
of
which
the
following
is
the
version
given
to
me
by
the
traders
in
remote
ages
there
lived
a
powerful
shaman
pronounced
tshaumen
by
the
indians
this
being
the
local
name
for
what
is
known
as
medicine
man
among
the
indians
farther
south
and
east
the
tshaumen
holds
a
position
and
exercises
an
influence
among
the
people
he
lives
with
something
akin
to
the
wise
men
or
magi
of
olden
times
in
the
east
in
this
powerful
being
locality
there
lived
a
poor
man
who
had
the
great
misfortune
to
have
an
inveterate
scold
for
a
wife
he
bore
the
infliction
for
a
long
time
without
murmuring
in
hopes
that
she
would
relent
but
time
seemed
only
to
increase
the
affliction
at
length
growing
weary
of
the
unceasing
torment
he
complained
to
the
tshaumen
who
comforted
him
and
sent
him
home
with
the
assurance
that
all
would
soon
be
well
shortly
after
this
he
went
out
to
hunt
and
remained
away
for
many
days
endeavoring
to
get
some
provisions
for
home
use
but
without
avail
he
returned
weary
and
hungry
only
to
be
met
by
his
wife
with
a
more
than
usually
violent
outburst
of
scolding
this
so
provoked
him
that
he
gathered
all
his
strength
and
energy
for
one
grand
effort
and
gave
her
a
kick
that
sent
her
clean
across
the
river
on
landing
she
was
converted
into
the
mass
of
rock
which
remains
to
this
day
a
memorial
of
her
viciousness
and
a
warning
to
all
future
scolds
the
metamorphosis
was
effected
by
the
tshaumen
but
how
the
necessary
force
was
acquired
to
send
her
across
the
river
here
about
half
a
mile
wide
or
whether
the
kick
was
administered
by
the
tshaumen
or
the
husband
my
narrator
could
not
say
he
was
altogether
at
a
loss
to
account
for
conversion
of
the
husband
into
the
mass
of
rock
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
nor
can
i
offer
any
theory
unless
it
is
that
he
was
by
astonishment
at
the
result
such
legends
as
this
would
be
of
interest
to
ethnologists
if
they
could
be
procured
direct
from
the
indians
but
repeated
by
men
who
have
little
or
no
knowledge
of
the
utility
of
legendary
lore
and
less
sympathy
with
it
they
lose
much
of
their
value
between
forty
mile
river
and
the
boundary
line
no
stream
of
any
size
joins
the
yukon
in
fact
there
is
only
one
stream
which
some
of
the
miners
have
named
sheep
creek
but
as
there
is
another
stream
further
down
the
river
called
by
the
same
name
i
have
named
it
coal
creek
it
is
five
miles
below
forty
mile
and
comes
in
from
the
east
and
is
a
large
creek
but
not
at
all
navigable
on
it
some
extensive
coal
seams
were
seen
which
will
be
more
fully
referred
to
further
on
at
the
boundary
the
river
is
somewhat
contracted
and
measures
only
feet
across
in
the
winter
but
in
summer
at
ordinary
water
level
it
would
be
about
one
hundred
feet
wider
immediately
below
the
boundary
it
expands
to
its
usual
width
which
is
about
feet
the
area
of
the
cross
section
measured
is
feet
the
sectional
area
of
the
teslintoo
as
determined
by
dawson
and
already
referred
to
is
feet
that
of
the
lewes
at
the
teslintoo
from
the
same
authority
is
feet
had
the
above
been
reduced
to
the
level
at
which
the
water
ordinarily
stands
during
the
summer
months
instead
of
to
the
height
at
which
it
stood
in
the
middle
of
september
when
it
was
almost
at
its
lowest
the
sectional
area
would
have
been
at
least
per
cent
more
and
at
spring
flood
level
about
double
the
above
area
it
is
a
difficult
matter
to
determine
the
actual
discharge
at
the
place
of
the
owing
to
the
irregularity
in
the
depth
and
current
the
latter
being
in
the
deep
channel
at
the
east
side
when
i
tried
it
in
september
approximately
miles
per
hour
while
on
the
bar
in
midstream
it
was
not
more
than
miles
per
hour
and
between
the
bar
and
the
westerly
shore
there
was
very
little
current
the
river
above
this
for
some
miles
was
no
better
for
the
purpose
of
measurement
at
the
boundary
it
is
narrow
and
clear
of
bars
and
islands
for
some
miles
but
here
i
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
determine
the
rate
of
the
current
before
the
river
froze
up
and
after
it
froze
the
drift
ice
was
jammed
and
piled
so
high
that
it
would
have
been
an
almost
endless
task
to
cut
holes
through
it
the
current
from
the
boundary
down
to
the
confluence
with
the
porcupine
is
said
to
be
strong
and
much
the
same
as
that
above
from
the
porcupine
down
for
a
distance
of
five
or
six
hundred
miles
it
is
called
medium
and
the
remainder
easy
from
stewart
river
to
the
mouth
of
the
yukon
is
about
miles
and
the
only
difficult
place
in
all
this
distance
is
the
part
near
the
confluence
with
the
porcupine
which
has
evidently
been
a
lake
in
past
ages
but
is
now
filled
with
islands
it
is
said
that
the
current
here
is
swift
and
the
channels
generally
narrow
rendering
navigation
difficult

advice
to
beginners
men
who
are
thinking
of
going
to
the
klondyke
regions
and
taking
a
trip
of
this
character
for
the
first
time
will
do
well
to
carefully
read
the
chapter
on
outfit
for
miners
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
take
anything
except
what
is
necessary
the
trip
is
a
long
arduous
one
and
a
man
should
not
add
one
pound
of
baggage
to
his
outfit
that
can
be
dispensed
with
i
have
known
men
who
have
loaded
themselves
up
with
rifles
revolvers
and
this
is
entirely
unnecessary
revolvers
will
get
you
into
trouble
and
there
is
no
use
of
taking
them
with
you
as
large
game
of
any
character
is
rarely
found
on
the
trip
i
have
prospected
through
this
region
for
some
years
and
have
only
seen
one
moose
you
will
not
see
any
large
game
whatever
on
your
trip
from
juneau
to
dawson
city
therefore
do
not
take
any
firearms
along
you
will
find
a
list
of
the
implements
for
the
miner
in
the
chapter
on
outfit
for
miners
the
miners
here
are
a
very
mixed
class
of
people
they
represent
many
nationalities
and
come
from
all
climates
their
lives
are
certainly
not
enviable
the
regulation
miner
cabin
is
by
with
walls
six
feet
high
and
gables
eight
feet
in
height
the
roof
is
heavily
earthed
and
the
cabin
is
generally
kept
very
warm
two
or
sometimes
three
or
four
men
will
live
in
a
house
of
this
size
the
ventilation
is
usually
bad
the
windows
being
very
small
those
miners
who
do
not
work
their
claims
during
the
winter
confine
themselves
to
these
small
huts
most
of
the
time
very
often
they
become
indolent
and
careless
only
eating
those
things
which
are
most
easily
cooked
or
prepared
during
the
busy
time
in
summer
when
they
are
shovelling
in
they
work
hard
and
for
long
hours
sparing
little
time
for
eating
and
much
less
for
cooking
this
manner
of
living
is
quite
common
amongst
beginners
and
soon
leads
to
debility
and
sometimes
to
scurvy
old
miners
have
learned
from
experience
to
value
health
more
than
gold
and
they
therefore
spare
no
expense
in
procuring
the
best
and
most
varied
outfit
of
food
that
can
be
obtained
in
a
cold
climate
such
as
this
where
it
is
impossible
to
get
fresh
vegetables
and
fruits
it
is
most
important
that
the
best
substitutes
for
these
should
be
provided
nature
helps
to
supply
these
wants
by
growing
cranberries
and
other
wild
fruits
in
abundance
but
men
in
summer
are
usually
too
busy
to
avail
themselves
of
these
the
diseases
met
with
in
this
country
are
dyspepsia
anaemia
scurvy
caused
by
improperly
cooked
food
sameness
of
diet
overwork
want
of
fresh
vegetables
overheated
and
badly
ventilated
houses
rheumatism
pneumonia
bronchitis
enteritis
cystitis
and
other
acute
diseases
from
exposure
to
wet
and
cold
debility
and
chronic
diseases
due
to
excesses
men
coming
to
klondyke
should
be
sober
strong
and
healthy
they
should
be
practical
men
able
to
adapt
themselves
quickly
to
their
surroundings
special
care
should
be
taken
to
see
that
their
lungs
are
sound
that
they
are
free
from
rheumatism
and
rheumatic
tendency
and
that
their
joints
especially
knee
joints
are
strong
and
have
never
been
weakened
by
injury
synovitis
or
other
disease
it
is
also
very
important
to
consider
their
temperaments
men
should
be
of
cheerful
hopeful
dispositions
and
willing
workers
those
of
sullen
morose
natures
although
they
may
be
good
workers
are
very
apt
as
soon
as
the
novelty
of
the
country
wears
off
to
become
dissatisfied
pessimistic
and
melancholy
chapter
iv
outfit
for
miners
in
giving
any
advice
for
outfits
for
miners
i
should
first
state
that
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
purchase
anything
whatever
before
arriving
at
juneau
alaska
this
has
been
a
supply
point
for
that
region
for
upwards
of
ten
years
and
and
supply
companies
carry
in
stock
exactly
what
is
necessary
for
the
miners
you
will
find
that
their
prices
are
reasonable
considering
the
difference
in
cost
of
transportation
at
any
point
you
might
decide
to
purchase
from
in
the
united
states
in
fact
it
is
the
saving
of
money
to
buy
in
juneau
in
the
matter
of
clothing
of
course
it
must
be
left
to
the
individual
taste
and
means
of
the
purchaser
but
the
miners
usually
adopt
the
native
costume
of
the
region
the
boots
are
generally
made
by
the
coast
indians
and
are
of
different
varieties
the
water
boot
is
made
of
seal
and
walrus
it
is
important
to
take
a
pair
of
rubber
boots
along
additional
boots
can
be
purchased
at
dawson
city
the
native
boots
cost
from
two
to
five
dollars
a
pair
trousers
are
generally
made
from
siberian
fawn
skins
and
the
skin
of
the
marmot
or
the
ground
squirrel
the
outer
garments
are
generally
made
of
the
marmot
skin
the
people
at
dawson
city
who
are
not
engaged
in
mining
such
as
clerks
generally
wear
these
garments
good
warm
flannels
are
important
everything
in
the
way
of
underwear
is
made
of
flannel
such
as
shirts
the
cost
of
flannel
shirts
at
dawson
city
is
rubber
boots
at
dawson
city
are
to
a
pair
blankets
and
robes
are
used
for
bedding
and
should
be
purchased
at
juneau
wolf
skins
make
the
best
robes
good
ones
cost
apiece
but
cheaper
ones
can
be
obtained
from
the
bear
mink
and
red
fox
and
arctic
hare
warm
socks
are
made
from
the
skin
of
the
arctic
hare
if
you
have
any
delay
at
juneau
you
will
probably
be
asked
to
take
trips
to
the
giant
glaciers
but
my
advice
is
to
stay
in
juneau
until
the
steamer
is
ready
to
start
for
dyea
you
will
need
all
the
rest
you
can
get
before
starting
up
the
pass
in
the
matter
of
provisions
the
following
is
a
list
which
is
considered
sufficient
to
last
a
man
on
his
trip
from
juneau
to
dawson
city
pounds
of
flour
pounds
of
bacon
beans
butter
vegetables
cans
of
condensed

tea
pounds
of
coffee
pound
of
salt
pounds
of
corn
meal
a
small

should
be
taken

kettle
yukon
stove
bean
pot
plates
tin
drinking
cup
tea
pot
knife
and
fork
large
and
small
cooking
pan
the
following
tools
should
he
brought
as
part
of
the
outfit
these
will
be
found
absolutely
necessary
to
build
a
boat
at

whip
saw
saw
axe
hatchet
pounds
of
assorted
nails
pound
of
oakum
pounds
of

juneau
sled
it
is
also
necessary
to
have
one
good
duck
tent
and
a
rubber
blanket
a
good
piece
of
mosquito
netting
will
not
be
heavy
and
will
also
be
very
great
comfort
on
the
trip
do
not
forget
to
put
in
a
good
supply
of
matches
and
take
a
small
supply
of
fishing
tackle
hooks
etc
it
is
very
important
that
you
have
a
pair
of
snow
glasses
to
guard
against
snow
blindness
it
will
be
interesting
to
know
the
prices
at
dawson
city
for
supplies
when
i
left
in
june
flour
was
sold
in
pound
bags
at
a

the
reports
already
received
of
the
finds
of
gold
seem
beyond
belief
but
the
greater
part
of
them
are
actual
facts
and
the
following
came
under
my
personal
observation
alexander
mcdonald
on
claim
no
eldorado
on
the
klondyke
started
drifting
on
his
claim
with
four
men
the
men
agreed
to
work
the
claim
on
shares
the
agreement
being
that
they
should
work
on
shares
by
each
receiving
half
of
what
they
could
get
out
the
five
together
took
out
in
days
the
ground
dug
up
was
found
to
measure
but
square
feet
this
was
an
exceptional
find
the
men
are
of
course
working
the
claim
and
had
square
feet
on
the
claim
still
to
work
out
when
i
left
for
the
east
people
in
the
east
or
elsewhere
can
hardly
realize
what
a
small
space
a
mining
claim
is
in
this
vast
and
comparatively
unexplored
territory
william
leggatt
on
claim
no
eldorado
together
with
william
gates
and
a
miner
named
shoots
purchased
their
claim
from
a
miner
named
stewart
and
his
partner
for
the
sum
of
they
did
not
have
money
to
make
the
payment
in
cash
but
made
a
first
payment
of
with
the
agreement
to
pay
the
balance
of
the
purchase
price
prior
to
july
they
sunk
a
shaft
and
commenced
taking
out
per
day
they
worked
the
pay
dirt
until
about
may
when
they
found
that
they
had
taken
out
and
the
space
of
the
claim
worked
was
only
square
a
young
man
who
went
to
the
klondyke
recently
writes
that
he
is
taking
out
a
day
from
his
claim
it
is
stated
on
good
authority
that
one
claim
yielded
in
feet
up
and
down
the
stream
clarence
berry
bought
out
his
two
partners
paying
one
and
the
other
and
has
taken
up
from
the
winter
dump
alone
peter
wiborg
has
purchased
more
ground
he
purchased
his
partner
interest
in
a
claim
paying
a
man
by
the
name
of
wall
has
all
he
thinks
he
wants
and
is
coming
out
he
sold
his
interests
for
nearly
all
the
gold
is
found
in
the
creek
bed
on
the
bed
rock
but
there
are
a
few
good
bench
diggings
perhaps
the
most
interesting
reading
in
the
is
the
letters
written
by
men
in
the
klondyke
to
friends
in
juneau
here
is
one
from
casey

friend
george
do
pay
any
attention
to
what
any
one
says
but
come
in
at
your
earliest
opportunity
my
god
it
is
appalling
to
hear
the
truth
but
nevertheless
the
world
has
never
produced
its
equal
before
well
come
that
all
your
friend
casey
burt
shuler
writing
from
klondyke
under
date
of
june
says
we
have
been
here
but
a
short
time
and
we
all
have
money
provisions
are
much
higher
than
they
were
two
years
ago
and
clothing
is
clean
out
of
sight
one
of
the
boats
was
lost
in
the
spring
and
there
will
be
a
shortage
of
provisions
again
this
fall
there
is
nothing
that
a
man
could
eat
or
wear
that
he
can
not
get
a
good
price
for
rubber
boots
are
worth
from
an
ounce
of
gold
to
a
pair
the
price
of
flour
has
been
raised
from
to
as
it
was
being
freighted
from
forty
mile
big
money
can
be
made
by
bringing
a
small
outfit
over
the
trail
this
fall
wages
have
been

day
all

though
a
reduction
to

attempted
but
the

here

a

that
is
eighteen
miles
long

as
far
as
is

without
a

there
are
not
enough
