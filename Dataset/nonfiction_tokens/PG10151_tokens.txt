charles
horne
the
three
centuries
which
follow
the
downfall
of
the
empire
of
charlemagne
laid
the
foundations
of
modern
europe
and
made
of
it
a
world
wholly
different
politically
socially
and
religiously
from
that
which
had
preceded
it
in
the
careers
of
greece
and
rome
we
saw
exemplified
the
results
of
two
sharply
opposing
tendencies
of
the
aryan
mind
the
one
toward
individualism
and
separation
the
other
toward
and
union
in
the
time
of
charlemagne
splendid
successes
it
appeared
settled
that
the
second
of
these
tendencies
was
to
guide
the
teutonic
aryans
that
the
europe
of
the
future
was
to
be
a
single
empire
ever
pushing
out
its
borders
as
rome
had
done
ever
subduing
its
weaker
neighbors
until
the
teutonic
peace
should
be
substituted
for
the
shattered
roman
peace
soldiers
should
be
needed
only
for
the
duties
of
police
and
a
whole
civilized
world
again
obey
the
rule
of
a
single
man
instead
of
this
the
race
has
since
followed
a
destiny
of
separation
europe
is
divided
into
many
countries
each
of
them
a
vast
camp
bristling
with
armies
and
arsenals
civilization
has
continued
by
war
even
to
our
own
day
and
during
at
least
seven
hundred
of
the
years
that
followed
charlemagne
mankind
made
no
greater
progress
in
the
arts
and
sciences
than
the
ancients
had
sometimes
achieved
in
a
single
century
we
do
indeed
believe
that
at
last
we
have
entered
on
an
age
of
rapid
advance
that
individualism
has
justified
itself
the
wider
personal
liberty
of
is
worth
all
that
the
race
has
suffered
for
it
yet
the
retardation
of
wellnigh
a
thousand
years
has
surely
been
a
giant
price
to
pay
downfall
of
charlemagne
empire
this
mighty
change
in
the
course
of
teutonic
destiny
this
breakdown
of
the
frankish
empire
was
wrought
by
two
destroying
forces
one
from
within
one
from
without
from
within
came
the
insubordination
the
still
savage
love
of
combat
the
natural
turbulence
of
the
race
it
is
conceivable
that
had
charlemagne
been
followed
on
the
throne
by
a
son
and
then
a
grandson
as
mighty
as
he
and
his
immediate
ancestors
the
course
of
the
whole
broad
earth
would
have
been
altered
the
franks
would
have
grown
accustomed
to
obey
further
conquest
abroad
would
have
insured
peace
at
home
the
imperial
power
would
have
become
strong
as
in
roman
days
when
the
most
feeble
emperors
could
not
be
shaken
but
the
descendants
of
charlemagne
sank
into
a
decline
he
himself
had
directed
the
fighting
energy
of
the
franks
against
foreign
enemies
his
son
and
successor
had
no
taste
for
war
and
so
allowed
his
idle
subjects
time
to
quarrel
with
him
and
with
one
another
the
next
generation
under
the
grandsons
of
charlemagne
devoted
their
entire
lives
to
repeated
and
furious
civil
wars
in
which
the
empire
fell
apart
the
flower
of
the
frankish
race
perished
and
the
strength
of
its
dominion
was
sapped
to
nothingness
footnote
see
of
frankish
page
there
were
three
of
these
grandsons
and
when
their
struggle
had
left
them
thoroughly
exhausted
they
divided
the
empire
into
three
their
treaty
of
verdun
is
often
quoted
as
beginning
the
modern
kingdoms
of
germany
france
and
italy
the
division
was
in
some
sense
a
natural
one
emphasized
by
differences
of
language
and
of
race
italy
was
peopled
by
descendants
of
the
ancient
italians
with
a
thin
intermingling
of
goths
and
lombards
france
held
gauls
with
a
very
considerable
percentage
of
the
frankish
blood
while
germany
was
far
more
barbaric
than
the
other
regions
its
people
whether
frank
or
saxon
were
all
pure
teuton
and
still
spoke
in
their
teutonic
or
german
tongue
the
franks
themselves
however
did
not
regard
this
as
a
breaking
of
their
empire
they
looked
on
it
as
merely
a
family
affair
an
arrangement
made
for
the
convenience
of
government
among
the
descendants
of
the
great
charles
so
firm
had
been
that
mighty
hero
grasp
upon
the
national
imagination
that
the
franks
accepted
as
matter
of
course
that
his
family
should
bear
rule
and
rallied
round
the
various
worthless
members
of
it
with
rather
pathetic
loyalty
fighting
for
them
one
against
the
other
reuniting
and
redividing
the
various
fragments
of
the
empire
until
the
feeble
carlovingian
race
died
out
completely
it
is
thus
evident
that
there
was
a
strong
tendency
toward
union
among
the
franks
but
there
was
also
an
outside
influence
to
disrupt
their
empire
charlemagne
had
not
carried
far
enough
their
career
of
conquest
he
subdued
the
teutons
within
the
limits
of
germany
but
he
did
not
reach
their
weaker
scandinavian
brethren
to
the
north
the
danes
and
norsemen
he
chastised
the
avars
a
vague
people
east
of
germany
but
he
could
not
make
provision
against
future
asiatic
swarms
he
humbled
the
arabs
in
spain
but
he
did
not
break
their
african
dominion
from
all
these
sources
as
the
franks
grew
weaker
instead
of
stronger
their
lands
became
exposed
to
new
invasion
the
last
invaders
let
us
take
a
moment
to
trace
the
fortunes
of
these
outside
races
though
the
main
destiny
of
the
future
still
lay
with
teutonic
europe
in
speaking
of
the
followers
of
mahomet
we
might
perhaps
at
this
period
better
drop
the
term
arabs
and
call
them
saracens
they
were
thus
known
to
the
christians
and
their
conquests
had
drawn
in
their
train
so
many
other
peoples
that
in
truth
there
was
little
pure
arab
blood
left
among
them
the
saracens
then
had
begun
to
lose
somewhat
of
their
intense
fanaticism
feuds
broke
out
among
them
different
chiefs
established
different
kingdoms
or
caliphates
whose
dominion
became
political
rather
than
religious
spain
had
one
ruler
egypt

asia
a
third
in
the
eleventh
century
an
army
of
saracens
invaded
india
and
added
that
strange
and
ancient
land
to
their
domain
europe
they
had
failed
to
conquer
but
their
fleets
commanded
the
mediterranean
they
held
all
its
islands
sicily
crete
sardinia

they
plundered
the

the
wave

remnants

population
visigoths
romans
and
still
older
peoples

their
way
down
from
their
secret
mountain
retreats

while
the
saracens
were
thus
laying
waste
the
frankish
empire
along
its
mediterranean
coasts
a
more
dangerous
enemy
was
assailing
it
from
the
east
toward
the
end
of
the
ninth
century
the
magyars
an
asiatic
turanian
people
burst
on
europe
as
the
huns
had
done
five
centuries
before
indeed
the
christians
called
these
later
comers
huns
also
and
told
of
them
the
same
extravagant
tales
of
terror
the
land
which
the
magyars
settled
was
called
hungary
they
dwell
there
and
possess
it
even
to
this
day
the
only
instance
of
a
turanian
people
having
permanently
established
themselves
in
an
aryan
continent
and
at
the
expense
of
aryan
neighbors
from
hungary
the
magyars
soon
advanced
to
the
german
border
line
and
made
fierce
plundering
inroads
upon
the
more
civilized
regions
beyond
they
came
on
horseback
so
that
the
slower
teutons
could
never
gather
quickly
enough
to
resist
them
the
marauding
parties
as
they
learned
the
wealth
and
weakness
of
this
new
land
grew
bigger
until
at
length
they
were
armies
and
defeated
the
german
franks
in
pitched
battles
and
spread
desolation
through
all
the
country
they
returned
now
every
year
their
ravages
extended
even
to
the
rhine
and
to
the
ancient
gallic
land
beyond
the
frankish
empire
seemed
doomed
to
reënact
in
a
smaller
far
more
savage
way
the
fate
of
rome
yet
more
widespread
in
destruction
more
important
in
result
than
the
raids
of
either
saracens
or
magyars
were
those
of
the
scandinavians
or
northmen
these
the
latest
and
perhaps
therefore
the
finest
flower
of
the
teutonic
stock
are
closer
to
us
and
hence
better
known
than
the
early
goths
or
franks
shut
off
in
their
cold
northern
peninsulas
and
islands
they
had
grown
more
slowly
it
may
be
than
their
southern
brethren
now
they
burst
suddenly
on
the
world
with
spectacular
dramatic
effect
wild
fierce
and
splendid
conquerors
as
keen
of
intellect
and
quick
of
wit
as
they
were
strong
of
arm
and
daring
of
adventure
we
see
them
first
as
pirates
venturing
even
in
charlemagne
time
to
plunder
the
german
and
french
coasts
one
tribe
of
them

a

empire
year
after
year
their
little
ships
plunder
the
undefended
french
coast
until
it
is
abandoned
to
them
and
becomes
a
desert
they
build
winter
camps
at
the
river
mouths
so
that
in
the
spring
they
need
lose
less
time

can
hurry
inland

they
venture
hundreds
of
miles
up

winding
waterways
paris
is
twice
attacked
by
them
and
must
fight
for
life
they
penetrate
so
far
up
the
loire
as
to
burn
orleans
it
was
under
stress
of
all
these
assaults
that
the
franks
grown
too
feeble
to
defend
themselves
as
charlemagne
would
have
done
by
marching
out
and
pursuing
the
invaders
to
their
own
homes
developed
instead
a
system
of
defence
which
made
the
middle
ages
what
they
were
all
central
authority
seemed
lost
each
little
community
was
left
to
defend
itself
as
best
it
might
so
the
local
chieftain
built
himself
a
rude
fortress
which
in
time
became
a
towered
castle
and
thither
the
people
fled
in
time
of
danger
each
man
looked
up
to
and
swore
faith
to
this
his
own
chief
his
immediate
protector
and
took
little
thought
of
a
distant
and
feeble
king
or
emperor
occasionally
of
course
a
stronger
lord
or
king
bestirred
himself
and
demanded
homage
of
these
various
petty
chieftains
they
gave
him
such
service
as
they
wished
or
as
they
must
this
was
the
feudal
system
footnote
see
its
frankish
birth
and
english
the
inclination
of
each
lesser
lord
was
obviously
to
assert
as
much
independence
as
he
could
he
naturally
objected
to
paying
money
or
service
without
benefit
received
and
he
could
see
no
good
that
this
overlord
did
for
him
or
for
his
district
it
seemed
likely
at
this
time
that
instead
of
being
divided
into
three
kingdoms
the
frankish
empire
would
split
into
thousands
of
little
castled
states
that
is
it
seemed
so
after
the
various
marauding
nations
were
disposed
of
the
northmen
were
pacified
by
presenting
them
outright
with
the
coast
lands
they
had
most
harried
their
great
leader
rolf
accepted
the
territory
with
some
vague
and
promise
of
vassalage
to
the
french
king
and
with
a
very
firmly
held
determination
that
he
would
let
no
pirates
ravage
his
land
or
cross
it
to
reach
others
so
the
french
coast
became
normandy
and
the
northmen
learned
the
tongue
and
manners
of
their
new
home
and
softened
their
harsh
name
to
norman
even
as
they
softened
their
harsh
ways
and
rapidly
became
the
most
able
and
most
cultured
of
frenchmen
as
for
the
saracens
being
unprogressive
and
no
longer
enthusiastic
they
grew
ever
feebler
while
the
italian
cities
being
aryan
and
left
to
themselves
grew
strong
at
length
their
fleets
met
those
of
the
saracens
on
equal
terms
and
defeated
them
and
gradually
wrested
from
them
the
control
of
the
mediterranean
invaders
were
thus
everywhere
met
as
they
came
locally
there
was
no
general
gathering
of
the
frankish
forces
against
them
the
repulse
of
the
huns
proved
the
hardest
matter
of
all
fortunately
for
the
germans
their
line
of
carlovingian
emperors
died
out
so
the
various
dukes
and
counts
practically
each
an
independent
sovereign
met
and
elected
a
king
from
among
themselves
not
really
to
rule
them
but
to
enable
them
to
unite
against
the
huns
after
their
first
elected
king
had
been
soundly
beaten
by
one
of
his
dukes
he
died
and
in
their
next
choice
they
had

of

themselves
strong

try
again

henry
son
otto
the
great
repeated
the
chastisement
he
then
formed
a
boundary
colony
or
from
which
sprang
austria
and
this
border
kingdom
was
always
able
to
keep
the
weakened
huns
in
check
at
the
same
time
there
was
growing
up
in
russia
a
slavic
civilization
which
received
christianity
from
the
south
as
it
had
received
teutonic
dominion
from
the
north
and
so
developed
along
very
similar
lines
to
western
europe
the
russian
states
served
as
a
barrier
against
later
asiatic
hordes
and
this
combined
with
the
civilizing
of
the
last
remnants
of
the
scandinavians
in
the
north
and
the
fading
of
saracenic
power
in
the
south

the
tottering
civilization
of
the
west
free
from
further
barbarian
invasion

shall
find
destruction
threatened
again
in

ages
by
tartar
and
by
turk
but
the
intruders
never
reach
beyond
the
frontier
the
teutons
and
the
ancients
with
whom
they
had
assimilated
were
left
to
work
out
their
own
problems
all
the
ingredients

the

been

does
it
appear
possible
with

that
our

will
ever
again
be
even
menaced
by

chronologists
frequently
adopt
as
a
convenient
for
this
modern
development
the
year
in
which
otto
the
great
conqueror
of
the
huns
felt
himself
strong
enough
to
march
a
german
army
to
rome
and
assume
there
the
title
of
emperor
which
had
been
long
in
abeyance
to
be
sure
there
was
still
an
emperor
of
the
east
in
constantinople
but
nobody
thought
of
him
and
to
be
sure
the
power
of
otto
and
the
later
emperors
was
purely
german
with
scarce
a
pretence
of
extending
beyond
their
own
country
and
sometimes
italy
yet
here
was
at
least
one
restored
influence
that
made
toward
unity
and
by
its
own
devious
and
erratic
ways
toward
peace
it
must
not
be
supposed
of
course
that
there
was
no
more
war
but
as
it
became
a
private
affair
between
relatives
or
at
least
acquaintances
its
ravages
were
greatly
reduced
it
was
accepted
as
the
pastime
of
gentlemen
the
sport
of
kings
and
though
we
may
quote
the
phrases
with
kindling
sarcasm
yet
they
open
a
very
different
vision
from
that
of
the
older
inroads
by
unknown
hordes
frenzied
with
the
passion
and
the
purpose
of
the
brute
the
usefulness
of
the
common
people
was
recognized
and
they
were
allowed
to
continue
to
live
and
cultivate
the
ground
while
all
the
great
dukes
and
even
the
lesser
nobles
having
secured
as
many
castles
as
possible
intrenched
themselves
in
their
strongholds
and
defied
all
comers
they
asserted
their
right
of
private
war
and
attacked
each
other
upon
every
conceivable
provocation
whether
it
were
the
disputed
succession
to
some
vast
estate
or
the
ravage
spread
by
a
reckless
cow
in
a
foreign
field
indeed
it
is
not
always
easy
to
distinguish
these
private
wars
from
mere
robberies
or
plundering
expeditions
and
it
is
not
probable
that
the
wild
barons
exercised
any
very
delicate
discrimination
even
otto
the
great
had
little
real
influence
or
authority
over
such
lords
as
these
his
immediate
successors
found
themselves
with
even
less
in
short
it
was
the
golden
age
of
feudalism
of
the
individual
feudal
lords

italy
there
was
no
central
authority
whatever
nor
among
the
little
christian
states
gradually
arising

france

the
title
of
king
was

a
name
france
was
really
composed
of
a
dozen
or
more
independent
counties
and
dukedoms
for
a
while
its
lords
elected
a
king
as
the
germans
did
and
gradually
the
title
became
hereditary
in
the
capet
family
the
counts
of
paris
who
had
fought
most
valiantly
against
the
northmen
but
the
entire
power
of
these
kings
lay
in
their
own
estates
in
the
fact
that
they
were
counts
of
paris
and
by
marriage
or
by
force
were
slowly
adding
new
possessions
to
their
old
any
other
noble
might
have
been
equally
fortunate
in
his
investments
and
wrested
from
them
their
purely
honorary
title

there
was
more

ages
had
sustained

helped
it

the
mightiest
has
been
left
to
speak
of
last
it
was
christianity
a
christianity
which
had
by
now
taken
definite
form
as
the
roman
catholic
church
strongest
of
all
the
institutions
bequeathed
by
the
ancient
empire
to
her
conquerors
was
this
church
indeed
it
has
been
said
that
rome
had
influenced
christianity
quite
as
much
as
christianity
did
rome
the
romans
insisted
on
the
laying
out
of
exact
doctrines
and
creeds
on
the
building
of
a
definite
organization
a
priesthood
a
hierarchy
they
lent
the
weight
of
law
to
what
had
been
but
individual
belief
and
impulse
thus
the
church
grew
hard
and
strong
in
the
same
manner
that
the
early
emperors
had
ordered
the
persecution
of
christianity
so
the
later
ones
ordered
the
persecution
of
heathendom
nor
had
the
church
grown
civilized
or
christian
enough
to
oppose
this
method
of
conversion
luckily
for
all
parties
however
the
heathen
were
scarce
sufficiently
enthusiastic
to
insist
on
martyrdom
and
so
the
persecuting
spirit
which
man
ultimately
imparted
to
even
the
purest
of
religions
remained
latent
with
the
downfall
of
rome
there
came
another
interval
in
which
the
church
was
weak
and
was
trampled
on
by
barbarians
and
was
heroic
then
the
bishops
of
rome
joined
forces
with
pépin
and
charlemagne
christianity
became
physically
powerful
again
the
saxons
were
converted

the
sword
so
also
in
henry
the
fowler
time
were
the
slavic
wends
these
roman
bishops
or
popes
were
accepted
unquestioned
throughout
western
europe
as
the
leaders
of
a
militant
christianity
a
position
never
after
denied
them
until
the
sixteenth
century
in
the
east
however
the
bishops
of
constantinople
insisted
on
an
equal

not
higher
authority

so

broke
apart

christianity
undoubtedly
did
great
good
its
teachings
though
applied
by
often
fallible
instruments
and
in
blundering
ways
yet
never
completely
lost
sight
of
their
own
higher
meanings
of
mercy
and
peace
from
the
abbey
of
cluny
originated
that
quaint
mediaeval
idea
of
the
truce
of
god
by
which
nobles
were
very
widely
persuaded
to
restrict
their
private
wars
to
the
middle
of
the
week
and
reserve
at
least
friday
saturday
and
sunday
as
days
of
brotherly
love
and
religious
devotion
the
church
also
from
very
early
days
founded
monasteries
wherein
learning
and
the
knowledge
of
the
past
were
kept
alive
where
pity
continued
to
exist
where
the
oppressed
found
refuge
it
is
from
these
monasteries
that
all
the
arts
and
scholarship
of
the
eleventh
century
begin
dimly
to
emerge
moreover
the
fact
that
the
teutons
were
all
of
a
common
religion
undoubtedly
held
them
much
closer
together
made
them
more
merciful
among
themselves
more
nearly
a
unit
against
the
outside
world
perhaps
in
this
respect
more
important
even
than
the
religion
was
the
church
that
is
the
hierarchy
the
vast
army
of
monks
and
priests
abbots
and
bishops
spread
over
all
kingdoms
yet
looking
always
toward
rome
here
at
least
was
one
common
centre
for
western
civilization
one
mighty
influence
that
all
men
acknowledged
that
all
to
some
faint
extent
obeyed
the
growth
of
the
papacy
the
power
thus
concentrating
in
the
roman
papacy
made
the
office
one
to
attract
eager
ambition
it
has
a
political
history
of
its
own
at
first
the
christian
populace
that
continued
to
dwell
in
rome
despite
the
repeated
spoliations
elected
from
among
themselves
their
own
pope
or
bishop
regarding
him
not
only
as
their
spiritual
guide
but
as
their
earthly
leader
and
protector
also
naturally
in
their
distress
they
chose
the
very
ablest
man
they
could
their
wisest
and
their
noblest
it
was
no
pleasant
task
being
pope
in
those
dark
days
and
sometimes
the
bravest
shrank
from
the
position
but
centuries
of
war
and
developed
a
roman
populace
more
fierce
and
savage
and
degenerate
while
the
growing
importance
of
their
pope
beyond
the
city
walls
brought
wealth
and
splendor
to
his
office
the
result
was
that
some
very
unsaintly
popes
were
elected
amid
unseemly
squabbles
the
conditions
surrounding
the
high
office
became
so
bad
that
they
were
felt
as
a
disgrace
throughout
all
christendom
and
in
the
german
emperor
henry
iii
took
upon
himself
to
depose
three
fiercely
contending
romans
each
claiming
to
be
pope
he
appointed
in
their
stead
a
candidate
of
his
own
not
a
dweller
in
the
city
at
all
but
a
german
henry
therefore
must
have
considered
the
duties
of
the
pope
as
bishop
of
the
romans
to
be
far
less
important
than
his
duties
as
head
of
the
church
outside

so
necessary
had
this
interference
by

as
he
continued
to
appoint
pope
after
pope
churchmen
realized
that
in
the
hands
of
an
evil
emperor
this
method
of
securing
their
head
might
prove
quite
as
dangerous
and
unsatisfactory
as
the
former
one
so
the
church
took
the
matter
in
hand
and
declared
that
a
conclave
of
its
own
highest
officials
should
thereafter
choose
the
man
who
was
to
lead
them
under
this
surely
more
suitable
arrangement

papal
office
rose
at
once
in
dignity
it
was
held
for
a
time
by
true
leaders
earnest
prelates
of
the
highest
worth
and
ability
we
have
said
that
the
rank
of
the
bishop
of
rome
as
head
of
the
church
had
never
been
seriously
questioned
among
the
teutons
but
now
the
popes
asserted
a
political
authority
as
well
they
regarded
themselves
theoretically
as
supreme
heads
of
the
entire
christian
world
they
claimed
and
even
partly
exercised
the
right
to
create
and
depose
kings
and
emperors
to
such
a
supremacy
as
this
however
the
teutons
were
still
too
rude
and
warlike
to
submit
much
is
made
of
the
fact
that
the
emperor
henry
iv
was
compelled
to
come
as
a
suppliant
to
pope
gregory
at
canossa
but
this
submission
was
only
forced
on
him
by
quarrels
with
his
barons
who
welcomed
the
pope
as
a
chance
ally
it
proved
the
power
of
feudalism
rather
than
that
of
religion
still
we
may
trace
here
the
beginnings
of
a
later
day
when
spirit
was
really
to
dominate
bodily
force
when

feudalism
its
frankish
birth
and
english
development
ninth
to
twelfth
century
william
stubbs
that
social
system
however
varying
in
different
times
and
places
in
which
ownership
of
land
is
the
basis
of
authority
is
known
in
history
as
feudalism
from
the
time
of
clovis
the
frankish
king
who
died
in
the
progress
of
the
franks
in
civilization
was
slow
and
for
more
than
two
centuries
they
spent
their
energies
mainly
in
useless
wars
but
charles
martel
and
his
son
pépin
the
short
the
latter
dying
in
built
up
a
kingdom
which
charlemagne
erected
into
a
powerful
empire
under
the
predecessors
of
charlemagne
the
beginnings
of
feudalism
which
are
very
obscure
may
be
said
vaguely
to
appear
charles
martel
had
to
buy
the
services
of
his
nobles
by
granting
them
lands
and
although
he
and
pépin
strengthened
the
royal
power
which
charlemagne
still
further
increased
under
the
weak
rulers
who
followed
them
the
forces
of
the
incipient
feudalism
again
became
active
and
the
state
was
divided
into
petty
countships
and
dukedoms
almost
independent
of
the
king
the
gift
of
land
by
the
king
in
return
for
feudal
services
was
called
a
feudal
grant
and
the
land
so
given
was
termed
a
feud
or
fief
in
the
course
of
time
fiefs
became
hereditary
lands
were
also
sometimes
usurped
or
otherwise
obtained
by
subjects
who
thereby
became
feudal
lords
by
a
process
called
subinfeudation
lands
were
granted
in
parcels
to
other
men
by
those
who
received
them
from
the
king
or
otherwise
and
by
these
lower
landholders
to
others
again
and
as
the
first
recipient
became
the
vassal
of
the
king
and
the
suzerain
of
the
man
who
held
next
below
him
there
was
created
a
regular
descending
scale
of
such
vassalage
and
suzerainty
in
which
each
man
allegiance
was
directly
due
to
his
feudal
lord
and
not
to
the
king
himself
from
the
king
down
to
the
lowest
landholder
all
were
bound
together
by
obligation
of
service
and
defence
the
lord
to
protect
his
vassal
the
vassal
to
do
service
to
his
lord
these
are
the
essential
features
of
the
social
system
which
from
its
early
growth
under
the
later
carlovingians
in
the
ninth
century
spread
over
europe
and
reached
its
highest
development
in
the
twelfth
century
at
a
time
midway
between
these
periods
it
was
carried
by
the
norman
conquest
into
england
the
history
of
this
system
of
distinctly
frankish
origin
a
knowledge
of
which
is
absolutely
essential
to
a
proper
understanding
of
history
and
the
evolution
of
our
present
social
system
is
told
by
stubbs
with
that
discernment
and
thoroughness
of
analysis
which
have
given
him
his
rank
as
one
of
the
few
masterly
writers
in
this
field
feudalism
had
grown
up
from
two
great
sources
the
and
the
practice
of
commendation
and
had
been
specially
fostered
on
gallic
soil
by
the
existence
of
a
subject
population
which
admitted
of
any
amount
of
extension
in
the
methods
of
dependence
the
beneficiary
system
originated
partly
in
gifts
of
land
made
by
the
kings
out
of
their
own
estates
to
their
kinsmen
and
servants
with
a
special
undertaking
to
be
faithful
partly
in
the
surrender
by
of
their
estates
to
churches
or
powerful
men
to
be
received
back
again
and
held
by
them
as
tenants
for
rent
or
service
by
the
latter
arrangement
the
weaker
man
obtained
the
protection
of
the
stronger
and
he
who
felt
himself
insecure
placed
his
title
under
the
defence
of
the
church
by
the
practice
of
commendation
on
the
other
hand
the
inferior
put
himself
under
the
personal
care
of
a
lord
but
without
altering
his
title
or
divesting
himself
of
his
right
to
his
estate
he
became
a
vassal
and
did
homage
the
placing
of
his
hands
between
those
of
his
lord
was
the
typical
act
by
which
the
connection
was
formed
and
the
oath
of
fealty
was
taken
at
the
same
time
the
union
of
the
beneficiary
tie
with
that
of
commendation
completed
the
idea
of
feudal
obligation
the
twofold
engagement
that
of
the
lord
to
defend
and
that
of
the
vassal
to
be
faithful
a
third
ingredient
was
supplied
by
the
grants
of
immunity
by
which
in
the
frank
empire
as
in
england
the
possession
of
land
was
united
with
the
right
of
judicature
the
dwellers
on
a
feudal
property
were
placed
under
the
tribunal
of
the
lord
and
the
rights
which
had
belonged
to
the
nation
or
to
its
chosen
head
were
devolved
upon
the
receiver
of
a
fief
the
rapid
spread
of
the
system
thus
originated
and
the
assimilation
of
all
other
tenures
to
it
may
be
regarded
as
the
work
of
the
tenth
century
but
as
early
as
charles
the
bald
recognized
the
hereditary
character
of
all
benefices
and
from
that
year
the
growth
of
strictly
feudal
jurisprudence
may
be
held
to
date
the
system
testifies
to
the
country
and
causes
of
its
birth
the
beneficium
is
partly
of
roman
partly
of
german
origin
in
the
roman
system
the
usufruct
the
occupation
of
land
belonging
to
another
person
involved
no
diminution
of
status
in
the
germanic
system
he
who
tilled
land
that
was
not
his
own
was
imperfectly
free
the
reduction
of
a
large
roman
population
to
dependence
placed
the
two
classes
on
a
level
and
conduced
to
the
wide
extension
of
the
institution
commendation
on
the
other
hand
may
have
had
a
gallic
or
celtic
origin
and
an
analogy
only
with
the
roman
clientship
the
german
which
seems
to
have
ultimately
merged
its
existence
in
one
or
other
of
these
developments
is
of
course
to
be
carefully
distinguished
in
its
origin
from
them
the
tie
of
the
benefice
or
of
commendation
could
be
formed
between
any
two
persons
whatever
none
but
the
king
could
have
but
the
comitatus
of
history
preserved
a
more
distinct
existence
and
this
perhaps
was
one
of
the
causes
that
distinguished
the
later
system
most
definitely
from
the
feudalism
of
the
frank
empire
the
process
by
which
the
machinery
of
government
became
feudalized
although
rapid
was
gradual
the
weakness
of
the
carlovingian
kings
and
emperors
gave
room
for
the
speedy
development
of
disruptive
tendencies
in
a
territory
so
extensive
and
so
little
consolidated
the
duchies
and
counties
of
the
eighth
and
ninth
centuries
were
still
official
magistracies
the
holders
of
which
discharged
the
functions
of
imperial
judges
or
generals
such
officers
were
of
course
men
whom
the
kings
could
trust
in
most
cases
franks
courtiers
or
kinsmen
who
at
an
earlier
date
would
have
been
or
antrustions
and
who
were
provided
for
by
feudal
benefices
the
official
magistracy
had
in
itself
the
tendency
to
become
hereditary
and
when
the
benefice
was
recognized
as
heritable
the
provincial
governorship
became
so
too
but
the
provincial
governor
had
many
opportunities
of
improving
his
position
especially
if
he
could
identify
himself
with
the
manners
and
aspirations
of
the
people
he
ruled
by
marriage
or
inheritance
he
might
accumulate
in
his
family
not
only
the
old
allodial
estates
which
especially
on
german
soil
still
continued
to
subsist
but
the
traditions
and
local
loyalties
which
were
connected
with
the
possession
of
them
so
in
a
few
years
the
frank
magistrate
could
unite
in
his
own
person
the
beneficiary
endowment
the
imperial
deputation
and
the
headship
of
the
nation
over
which
he
presided
and
then
it
was
only
necessary
for
the
central
power
to
be
a
little
weakened
and
the
independence
of
duke
or
count
was
limited
by
his
homage
and
fealty
alone
that
is
by
obligations
that
depended
on
conscience
only
for
their
fulfilment
it
is
in
germany
that
the
disruptive
tendency
most
distinctly
takes
the
political
form
saxony
and
bavaria
assert
their
national
independence
under
swabian
and
saxon
dukes
who
have
identified
the
interests
of
their
subjects
with
their
own
in
france
where
the
ancient
tribal
divisions
had
been
long
obsolete
and
where
the
existence
of
the
allod
involved
little
or
no
feeling
of
loyalty
the
process
was
simpler
still
the
provincial
rulers
aimed
at
practical
rather
than
political
sovereignty
the
people
were
too
weak
to
have
any
aspirations
at
all
the
disruption
was
due
more
to
the
abeyance
of
central
attraction
than
to
any
centrifugal
force
existing
in
the
provinces
but
the
result
was
the
same
feudal
government
a
graduated
system
of
jurisdiction
based
on
land
tenure
in
which
every
lord
judged
taxed
and
commanded
the
class
next
below
him
of
which
abject
slavery
formed
the
lowest
and
irresponsible
tyranny
the
highest
grade
and
private
war
private
coinage
private
prisons
took
the
place
of
the
imperial
institutions
of
government
this
was
the
social
system
which
william
the
conqueror
and
his
barons
had
been
accustomed
to
see
at
work
in
france
one
part
of
it
the
feudal
tenure
of
land
was
perhaps
the
only
kind
of
tenure
which
they
could
understand
the
king
was
the
original
lord
and
every
title
issued
mediately
or
immediately
from
him
the
other
part
the
governmental
system
of
feudalism
was
the
point
on
which
sooner
or
later
the
duke
and
his
barons
were
sure
to
differ
already
the
incompatibility
of
the
system
with
the
existence
of
the
strong
central
power
had
been
exemplified
in
normandy
where
the
strength
of
the
dukes
had
been
tasked
to
maintain
their
hold
on
the
castles
and
to
enforce
their
own
high
justice
much
more
difficult
would
england
be
to
retain
in
norman
hands
if
the
new
king
allowed
himself
to
be
fettered
by
the
french
system
on
the
other
hand
the
norman
barons
would
fain
rise
a
step
in
the
social
scale
answering
to
that
by
which
their
duke
had
become
a
king
and
they
aspired
to
the
same
independence
which
they
had
seen
enjoyed
by
the
counts
of
southern
and
eastern
france
nor
was
the
aspiration
on
their
part
altogether
unreasonable
they
had
joined
in
the
conquest
rather
as
sharers
in
the
great
adventure
than
as
mere
vassals
of
the
duke
whose
birth
they
despised
as
much
as
they
feared
his
strength
william
however
was
wise
and
wary
as
well
as
strong
while
by
the
insensible
process
of
custom
or
rather
by
the
mere
assumption
that
feudal
tenure
of
land
was
the
only
lawful
and
reasonable
one
the
frankish
system
of
tenure
was
substituted
for
the
the
organization
of
government
on
the
same
basis
was
not
equally
a
matter
of
course
the
conqueror
himself
was
too
strong
to
suffer
that
organization
to
become
formidable
in
his
reign
but
neither
the
brutal
force
of
william
rufus
nor
the
heavy
and
equal
pressure
of
the
government
of
henry
i
could
extinguish
the
tendency
toward
it
it
was
only
after
it
had
under
stephen
broken
out
into
anarchy
and
plunged
the
whole
nation
in
misery
when
the
great
houses
founded
by
the
barons
of
the
conquest
had
suffered
forfeiture
or
extinction
when
the
normans
had
become
englishmen
under
the
legal
and
constitutional
reforms
of
henry
ii
that
the
royal
authority
in
close
alliance
with
the
nation
was
enabled
to
put
an
end
to
the
evil
william
the
conqueror
claimed
the
crown
of
england
as
the
chosen
heir
of
edward
the
confessor
it
was
a
claim
which
the
english
did
not
admit
and
of
which
the
normans
saw
the
fallacy
but
which
he
himself
consistently
maintained
and
did
his
best
to
justify
in
that
claim
he
saw
not
only
the
justification
of
the
conquest
in
the
eyes
of
the
church
but
his
great
safeguard
against
the
jealous
and
aggressive
host
by
whose
aid
he
had
realized
it
therefore
immediately
after
the
battle
of
hastings
he
proceeded
to
seek
the
national
recognition
of
its
validity
he
obtained
it
from
the
divided
and
dismayed
with
no
great
trouble
and
was
crowned
by
the
archbishop
of
york
the
most
influential
and
patriotic
among
them
binding
himself
by
the
constitutional
promises
of
justice
and
good
laws
standing
before
the
altar
at
westminster
in
the
presence
of
the
clergy
and
people
he
promised
with
an
oath
that
he
would
defend
god
holy
churches
and
their
rulers
that
he
would
moreover
rule
the
whole
people
subject
to
him
with
righteousness
and
royal
providence
would
enact
and
hold
fast
right
law
and
utterly
forbid
rapine
and
unrighteous
judgments
the
form
of
election
and
acceptance
was
regularly
observed
and
the
legal
position
of
the
new
king
completed
before
he
went
forth
to
finish
the
conquest
had
it
not
been
for
this
the
norman
host
might
have
fairly
claimed
a
division
of
the
land
such
as
the
danes
had
made
in
the
ninth
century
but
to
the
people
who
had
recognized
william
it
was
but
just
that
the
chance
should
be
given
them
of
retaining
what
was
their
own
accordingly
when
the
lands
of
all
those
who
had
fought
for
harold
were
confiscated
those
who
were
willing
to
acknowledge
william
were
allowed
to
redeem
theirs
either
paying
money
at
once
or
giving
hostages
for
the
payment
that
under
this
redemption
lay
the
idea
of
a
new
title
to
the
lands
redeemed
may
be
regarded
as
questionable
the
feudal
lawyer
might
take
one
view
and
the
plundered
proprietor
another
but
if
charters
of
confirmation
or
regrant
were
generally
issued
on
the
occasion
to
those
who
were
willing
to
redeem
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
as
soon
as
the
feudal
law
gained
general
acceptance
these
would
be
regarded
as
conveying
a
feudal
title
what
to
the
english
might
be
a
mere
payment
of
or
composition
for
a
recognized
offence
might
to
the
normans
seem
equivalent
to
forfeiture
and
restoration
but
however
this
was
the
process
of
confiscation
and
redistribution
of
lands
under
the
new
title
began
from
the
moment
of
the
coronation
the
next
few
years
occupied
in
the
reduction
of
western
and
northern
england
added
largely
to
the
stock
of
divisible
estates
the
tyranny
of
odo
of
bayeux
and
william
fitzosbern
which
provoked
attempts
at
rebellion
in
the
stand
made
by
the
house
of
godwin
in
devonshire
in
the
attempts
of
mercia
and
northumbria
to
shake
off
the
normans
in
and
the
last
struggle
for
independence
in
in
which
edwin
and
morcar
finally
fell
the
conspiracy
of
the
norman
earls
in
in
consequence
of
which
waltheof
perished
all
tended
to
the
same
result
after
each
effort
the
royal
hand
was
laid
on
more
heavily
more
and
more
land
changed
owners
and
with
the
change
of
owners
the
title
changed
the
complicated
and
unintelligible
irregularities
of
the
tenures
were
exchanged
for
the
simple
and
uniform
feudal
theory
the
fifteen
hundred
of
take
the
place
of
the
countless
of

and
the
loose
unsystematic
arrangements
which
had
grown
up
in
the
confusion
of
title
tenure
and
jurisdiction
were
replaced
by
systematic
custom
the
change
was
effected
without
any
legislative
act
simply
by
the
process
of
transfer
under
circumstances
in
which
simplicity
and
uniformity
were
an
absolute
necessity
it
was
not
the
change
from
allodial
to
feudal
so
much
as
from
confusion
to
order
the
actual
amount
of
dispossession
was
no
doubt
greatest
in
the
higher
ranks
the
smaller
owners
may
to
a
large
extent
have
remained
in
a
mediatized
position
on
their
estates
but
even
with
all
its
fulness
and
accuracy
can
not
be
supposed
to
enumerate
all
the
changes
of
the
twenty
eventful
years
that
followed
the
battle
of
hastings
it
is
enough
for
our
purpose
to
ascertain
that
a
universal
assimilation
of
title
followed
the
general
changes
of
ownership
the
king
of
is
the
supreme
landlord
all
the
land
of
the
nation
the
old
folkland
has
become
the
king
and
all
private
land
is
held
mediately
or
immediately
of
him
all
holders
are
bound
to
their
lords
by
homage
and
fealty
either
actually
demanded
or
understood
to
be
demandable
in
every
case
of
transfer
by
inheritance
or
otherwise
the
result
of
this
process
is
partly
legal
and
partly
constitutional
or
political
the
legal
result
is
the
introduction
of
an
elaborate
system
of
customs
tenures
rights
duties
profits
and
jurisdictions
the
constitutional
result
is
the
creation
of
several
intermediate
links
between
the
body
of
the
nation
and
the
king
in
the
place
of
or
side
by
side
with
the
duty
of
allegiance
on
the
former
of
these
points
we
have
very
insufficient
data
for
we
are
quite
in
the
dark
as
to
the
development
of
feudal
law
in
normandy
before
the
invasion
and
may
be
reasonably
inclined
to
refer
some
at
least
of
the
peculiarities
of
english
feudal
law
to
the
leaven
of
the
system
which
it
superseded
nor
is
it
easy
to
reduce
the
organization
described
in
to
strict
conformity
with
feudal
law
as
it
appears
later
especially
with
the
general
prevalence
of
military
tenure
the
growth
of
knighthood
is
a
subject
on
which
the
greatest
obscurity
prevails
and
the
most
probable
explanation
of
its
existence
in
england
the
theory
that
it
is
a
translation
into
norman
forms
of
the
of
the
law
can
only
be
stated
as
probable
between
the
picture
drawn
in
and
the
state
of
affairs
which
the
charter
of
henry
i
was
designed
to
remedy
there
is
a
difference
which
the
short
interval
of
time
will
not
account
for
and
which
testifies
to
the
action
of
some
skilful
organizing
hand
working
with
neither
justice
nor
mercy
hardening
and
sharpening
all
lines
and
points
to
the
perfecting
of
a
strong
government
it
is
unnecessary
to
recapitulate
here
all
the
points
in
which
the
institutions
were
already
approaching
the
feudal
model
it
may
be
assumed
that
the
actual
obligation
of
military
service
was
much
the
same
in
both
systems
and
that
even
the
amount
of
land
which
was
bound
to
furnish
a
mounted
warrior
was
the
same
however
the
conformity
may
have
been
produced
the
of
the
english
earl
or
was
in
close
resemblance
with
the
of
the
norman
count
or
knight
but
however
close
the
resemblance
something
was
now
added
that
made
the
two
identical
the
change
of
the
heriot
to
the
relief
implies
a
suspension
of
ownership
and
carries
with
it
the
custom
of
livery
of
seisin
the
heriot
was
the
payment
of
a
debt
from
the
dead
man
to
his
lord
his
son
succeeded
him
by
allodial
right
the
relief
was
paid
by
the
heir
before
he
could
obtain
his
father
lands
between
the
death
of
the
father
and
livery
of
seisin
to
the
son
the
right
of
the
overlord
had
entered
the
ownership
was
to
a
certain
extent
resumed
and
the
succession
of
the
heir
took
somewhat
of
the
character
of
a
new
grant
the
right
of
wardship
also
became
in
the
same
way
a
reëntry
by
the
lord
on
the
profits
of
the
estate
of
the
minor
instead
of
being
as
before
a
protection
by
the
head
of
the
kin
of
the
indefeasible
rights
of
the
heir
which
it
was
the
duty
of
the
whole
community
to
maintain
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
military
tenure
the
most
prominent
feature
of
historical
feudalism
was
itself
introduced
by
the
same
gradual
process
which
we
have
assumed
in
the
case
of
the
feudal
usages
in
general
we
have
no
light
on
the
point
from
any
original
grant
made
by
the
conqueror
to
a
lay
follower
but
judging
by
the
grants
made
to
the
churches
we
can
not
suppose
it
probable
that
such
gifts
were
made
on
any
expressed
condition
or
accepted
with
a
distinct
pledge
to
provide
a
certain
contingent
of
knights
for
the
king
service
the
obligation
of
national
defence
was
incumbent
as
of
old
on
all
and
the
customary
service
of
one
fully
armed
man
for
each
five
hides
of
land
was
probably
the
rate
at
which
the
newly
endowed
follower
of
the
king
would
be
expected
to
discharge
his
duty
the
wording
of
the
survey
does
not
imply
that
in
this
respect
the
new
military
service
differed
from
the
old
the
land
is
marked
out
not
into
knights
fees
but
into
hides
and
the
number
of
knights
to
be
furnished
by
a
particular
feudatory
would
be
ascertained
by
inquiring
the
number
of
hides
that
he
held
without
apportioning
the
particular
acres
that
were
to
support
the
particular
knight
it
would
undoubtedly
be
on
the
estates
of
the
lay
vassals
that
a
more
definite
usage
would
first
be
adopted
and
knights
bound
by
feudal
obligations
to
their
lords
receive
a
definite
estate
from
them
our
earliest
information
however
on
this
as
on
most
points
of
tenure
is
derived
from
the
notices
of
ecclesiastical
practice
lanfranc
we
are
told
turned
the
the
tenants
of
his
archiepiscopal
estates
into
knights
for
the
defence
of
the
country
he
enfeoffed
a
certain
number
of
knights
who
performed
the
military
service
due
from
the
archiepiscopal
barony
this
had
been
done
before
the
survey
and
almost
necessarily
implies
that
a
like
measure
had
been
taken
by
the
lay
vassals
lanfranc
likewise
maintained
ten
knights
to
answer
for
the
military
service
due
from
the
convent
of
christ
church
which
made
over
to
him
in
consideration
of
the
relief
land
worth
two
hundred
pounds
annually
the
value
of
the
knight
fee
must
already
have
been
fixed
at
twenty
pounds
a
year
in
the
reign
of
william
rufus
the
abbot
of
ramsey
obtained
a
charter
which
exempted
his
monastery
from
the
service
of
ten
knights
due
from
it
on
festivals
substituting
the
obligation
to
furnish
three
knights
to
perform
service
on
the
north
of
the
thames
a
proof
that
the
lands
of
that
house
had
not
yet
been
divided
into
knights
fees
in
the
next
reign
we
may
infer
from
the
favor
granted
by
the
king
to
the
knights
who
defended
their
lands
that
is
by
the
hauberk
that
their
demesne
lands
shall
be
exempt
from
pecuniary
taxation
that
the
process
of
definite
military
infeudation
had
largely
advanced
but
it
was
not
even
yet
forced
on
the
clerical
or
monastic
estates
when
in
the
abbot
of
milton
in
dorset
was
questioned
as
to
the
number
of
knights
fees
for
which
he
had
to
account
he
replied
that
all
the
services
due
from
his
monastery
were
discharged
out
of
the
demesne
but
he
added
that
in
the
reign
of
henry
i
during
a
vacancy
in
the
abbacy
bishop
roger
of
salisbury
had
enfeoffed
two
knights
out
of
the
abbey
lands
he
had
however
subsequently
reversed
the
act
and
had
restored
the
lands
whose
tenure
had
been
thus
altered
to
their
original
condition
of
estate
or
socage
the
very
term
the
new
feoffment
which
was
applied
to
the
fees
created
between
the
death
of
henry
i
and
the
year
in
which
the
account
preserved
in
the
of
the
exchequer
was
taken
proves
that
the
process
was
going
on
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
and
that
the
form
in
which
the
knights
fees
appear
when
called
on
by
henry
ii
for
scutage
was
most
probably
the
result
of
a
series
of
compositions
by
which
the
great
vassals
relieved
their
lands
from
a
general
burden
by
carving
out
particular
estates
the
holders
of
which
performed
the
services
due
from
the
whole
it
was
a
matter
of
convenience
and
not
of
tyrannical
pressure
the
statement
of
ordericus
vitalis
that
the
conqueror
distributed
lands
to
his
knights
in
such
fashion
that
the
kingdom
of
england
should
have
forever
sixty
thousand
knights
and
furnish
them
at
the
king
command
according
to
the
occasion
must
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
many
numerical
exaggerations
of
the
early
historians
the
officers
of
the
exchequer
in
the
twelfth
century
were
quite
unable
to
fix
the
number
of
existing
knights
fees
it
can
not
even
be
granted
that
a
definite
area
of
land
was
necessary
to
constitute
a
knight
fee
for
although
at
a
later
period
and
in
local
computations
we
may
find
four
or
five
hides
adopted
as
a
basis
of
calculation
where
the
extent
of
the
particular
knight
fee
is
given
exactly
it
affords
no
ground
for
such
a
conclusion
in
the
we
find
knights
fees
of
two
hides
and
a
half
of
two
hides
of
four
five
and
six
hides
geoffrey
ridel
states
that
his
father
held
one
hundred
and
and
a
for
which
the
service
of
fifteen
knights
was
due
but
that
no
knights
fees
had
been
carved
out
of
it
the
obligation
lying
equally
on
every
carucate
the
archbishop
of
york
had
far
more
knights
than
his
tenure
required
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
the
conclusion
that
the
extent
of
a
knight
fee
was
determined
by
rent
or
valuation
rather
than
acreage
and
that
the
common
quantity
was
really
expressed
in
the
twenty
the
twenty
pounds
worth
of
annual
value
which
until
the
reign
of
edward
i
was
the
qualification
for
knighthood
it
is
most
probable
that
no
regular
account
of
the
knights
fees
was
ever
taken
until
they
became
liable
to
taxation
either
in
the
form
of
under
henry
i
or
in
that
of
scutage
under
his
grandson
the
facts
however
which
are
here
adduced
preclude
the
possibility
of
referring
this
portion
of
the
feudal
innovations
to
the
direct
legislation
of
the
conqueror
it
may
be
regarded
as
a
secondary
question
whether
the
knighthood
here
referred
to
was
completed
by
the
investiture
with
knightly
arms
and
the
honorable
accolade
the
ceremonial
of
knighthood
was
practised
by
the
normans
whereas
the
evidence
that
the
english
had
retained
the
primitive
practice
of
investing
the
youthful
warrior
is
insufficient
yet
it
would
be
rash
to
infer
that
so
early
as
this
if
indeed
it
ever
was
the
case
every
possessor
of
a
knight
fee
received
formal
initiation
before
he
assumed
his
spurs
but
every
such
analogy
would
make
the
process
of
transition
easier
and
prevent
the
necessity
of
any
general
legislative
act
of
change
it
has
been
maintained
that
a
formal
and
definitive
act
forming
the
initial
point
of
the
feudalization
of
england
is
to
be
found
in
a
clause
of
the
laws
as
they
are
called
of
the
conqueror
which
directs
that
every
freeman
shall
affirm
by
covenant
and
oath
that
he
will
be
faithful
to
king
william
within
england
and
without
will
join
him
in
preserving
his
lands
and
honor
with
all
fidelity
and
defend
him
against
his
enemies
but
this
injunction
is
little
more
than
the
demand
of
the
oath
of
allegiance
which
had
been
taken
to
the
kings
and
is
here
required
not
of
every
feudal
dependent
of
the
king
but
of
every
freeman
or
freeholder
whatsoever
in
that
famous
council
of
salisbury
of
which
was
summoned
immediately
after
the
making
of
the
survey
we
learn
from
the
that
there
came
to
the
king
all
his
witan
and
all
the
landholders
of
substance
in
england
whose
vassals
soever
they
were
and
they
all
submitted
to
him
and
became
his
men
and
swore
oaths
of
allegiance
that
they
would
be
faithful
to
him
against
all
others
in
this
act
have
been
seen
the
formal
acceptance
and
date
of
the
introduction
of
feudalism
but
it
has
a
very
different
meaning
the
oath
described
is
the
oath
of
allegiance
combined
with
the
act
of
homage
and
obtained
from
all
whoever
their
feudal
lord
might
be
it
is
a
measure
of
precaution
taken
against
the
disintegrating
power
of
feudalism
providing
a
direct
tie
between
the
sovereign
and
all
freeholders
which
no
inferior
relation
existing
between
them
and
the
mesne
lords
would
justify
them
in
breaking
the
real
importance
of
the
passage
as
bearing
on
the
date
of
the
introduction
of
feudal
tenure
is
merely
that
it
shows
the
system
to
have
already
become
consolidated
all
the
of
the
kingdom
had
already
become
somehow
or
other
vassals
either
of
the
king
or
of
some
tenant
under
him
the
lesson
may
be
learned
from
the
fact
of
the
survey
the
introduction
of
such
a
system
would
necessarily
have
effects
far
wider
than
the
mere
modification
of
the
law
of
tenure
it
might
be
regarded
as
a
means
of
consolidating
and
concentrating
the
whole
machinery
of
government
legislation
taxation
judicature
and
military
defence
were
all
capable
of
being
organized
on
the
feudal
principle
and
might
have
been
so
had
the
moral
and
political
results
been
in
harmony
with
the
legal
but
its
tendency
when
applied
to
governmental
machinery
is
disruptive
the
great
feature
of
the
conqueror
policy
is
his
defeat
of
that
tendency
guarding
against
it
he
obtained
recognition
as
the
king
of
the
nation
and
so
far
as
he
could
understand
them
and
the
attitude
of
the
nation
allowed
he
maintained
the
usages
of
the
nation
he
kept
up
the
popular
institutions
of
the
hundred
court
and
the
shire
court
he
confirmed
the
laws
which
had
been
in
use
in
king
days
with
the
additions
which
he
himself
made
for
the
benefit
as
he
especially
tells
us
of
the
english
we
are
told
on
what
seems
to
be
the
highest
legal
authority
of
the
next
century
that
he
issued
in
his
fourth
year
a
commission
of
inquiry
into
the
national
customs
and
obtained
from
sworn
representatives
of
each
county
a
declaration
of
the
laws
under
which
they
wished
to
live
the
compilation
that
bears
his
name
is
very
little
more
than
a
reissue
of
the
code
of
canute
and
this
proceeding
helped
greatly
to
reconcile
the
english
people
to
his
rule
although
the
oppressions
of
his
later
years
were
far
heavier
than
the
measures
taken
to
secure
the
immediate
success
of
the
conquest
all
the
troubles
of
the
kingdom
after
in
his
sons
reigns
as
well
as
in
his
own
proceeded
from
the
insubordination
of
the
normans
not
from
the
attempts
of
the
english
to
dethrone
the
king
very
early
they
learned
that
if
their
interest
was
not
the
king
at
least
their
enemies
were
his
enemies
hence
they
are
invariably
found
on
the
royal
side
against
the
feudatories
this
accounts
for
the
maintenance
of
the
national
force
of
defence
over
and
above
the
feudal
army
the
of
the
english
the
general
armament
of
the
men
of
the
counties
and
hundreds
was
not
abolished
at
the
conquest
but
subsisted
even
through
the
reigns
of
william
rufus
and
henry
i
to
be
reformed
and
reconstituted
under
henry
ii
and
in
each
reign
it
gave
proof
of
its
strength
and
faithfulness
the
itself
retained
the
ancient
form
the
bishops
and
abbots
formed
a
chief
part
of
it
instead
of
being
as
in
normandy
so
insignificant
an
element
that
their
very
participation
in
deliberation
has
been
doubted
the
king
sat
crowned
three
times
in
the
year
in
the
old
royal
towns
of
westminster
winchester
and
gloucester
hearing
the
complaints
of
his
people
and
executing
such
justice
as
his
knowledge
of
their
law
and
language
and
his
own
imperious
will
allowed
in
all
this
there
is
no
violent
innovation
only
such
gradual
essential
changes
as
twenty
eventful
years
of
new
actors
and
new
principles
must
bring
however
insensibly
the
people
themselves
passing
away
and
being
replaced
by
their
children
may
be
educated
to
endurance
it
would
be
wrong
to
impute
to
the
conqueror
any
intention
of
deceiving
the
nation
by
maintaining
its
official
forms
while
introducing
new
principles
and
a
new
race
of
administrators
what
he
saw
required
change
he
changed
with
a
high
hand
but
not
the
less
surely
did
the
change
of
administrators
involve
a
change
of
custom
both
in
the
church
and
in
the
state
the
bishops
ealdormen
and
sheriffs
of
english
birth
were
replaced
by
normans
not
unreasonably
perhaps
considering
the
necessity
of
preserving
the
balance
of
the
state
with
the
change
of
officials
came
a
sort
of
amalgamation
or
duplication
of
titles
the
ealdorman
or
earl
became
the
or
count
the
sheriff
became
the
the
office
in
each
case
receiving
the
name
of
that
which
corresponded
most
closely
with
it
in
normandy
itself
with
the
amalgamation
of
titles
came
an
importation
of
new
principles
and
possibly
new
functions
for
the
norman
count
and
viscount
had
not
exactly
the
same
customs
as
the
earls
and
sheriffs
and
this
ran
up
into
the
highest
grades
of
organization
the
king
court
of
counsellors
was
composed
of
his
feudal
tenants
the
ownership
of
land
was
now
the
qualification
for
the
witenagemot
instead
of
wisdom
the
earldoms
became
fiefs
instead
of
magistracies
and
even
the
bishops
had
to
accept
the
status
of
barons
there
was
a
very
certain
danger
that
the
mere
change
of
persons
might
bring
in
the
whole
machinery
of
hereditary
magistracies
and
that
king
and
people
might
be
edged
out
of
the
administration
of
justice
taxation
and
other
functions
of
supreme
or
local
independence
against
this
it
was
most
important
to
guard
as
the
conqueror
learned
from
the
events
of
the
first
year
of
his
reign
when
the
severe
rule
of
odo
and
william
fitzosbern
had
provoked
herefordshire
ralph
guader
roger
montgomery
and
hugh
of
avranches
filled
the
places
of
edwin
and
morcar
and
the
brothers
of
harold
but
the
conspiracy
of
the
earls
in
opened
william
eyes
to
the
danger
of
this
proceeding
and
from
that
time
onward
he
governed
the
provinces
through
sheriffs
immediately
dependent
on
himself
avoiding
the
foreign
plan
of
appointing
hereditary
counts
as
well
as
the
english
custom
of
ruling
by
viceregal
ealdormen
he
was
however
very
sparing
in
giving
earldoms
at
all
and
inclined
to
confine
the
title
to
those
who
were
already
counts
in
normandy
or
in
france
to
this
plan
there
were
some
marked
exceptions
which
may
be
accounted
for
either
on
the
ground
that
the
arrangements
had
been
completed
before
the
need
of
watchfulness
was
impressed
on
the
king
by
the
treachery
of
the
normans
or
on
that
of
the
exigencies
of
national
defence
in
these
cases
he
created
or
suffered
the
continuance
of
great
palatine
jurisdictions
earldoms
in
which
the
earls
were
endowed
with
the
superiority
of
whole
counties
so
that
all
the
held
feudally
of
them
in
which
they
received
the
whole
profits
of
the
courts
and
exercised
all
the
regalia
or
royal
rights
nominated
the
sheriffs
held
their
own
councils
and
acted
as
independent
princes
except
in
the
owing
of
homage
and
fealty
to
the
king
two
of
these
palatinates
the
earldom
of
chester
and
the
bishopric
of
durham
retained
much
of
their
character
to
our
own
days
a
third
the
palatinate
of
bishop
odo
in
kent
if
it
were
really
a
jurisdiction
of
the
same
sort
came
to
an
end
when
odo
forfeited
the
confidence
of
his
brother
and
nephew
a
fourth
the
earldom
of
shropshire
which
is
not
commonly
counted
among
the
palatine
jurisdictions
but
which
possessed
under
the
montgomery
earls
all
the
characteristics
of
such
a
dignity
was
confiscated
after
the
treason
of
robert
of
belesme
by
henry
i
these
had
been
all
founded
before
the
conspiracy
of
they
were
also
like
the
later
lordships
of
the
marches
a
part
of
the
national
defence
chester
and
shropshire
kept
the
welsh
marches
in
order
kent
was
the
frontier
exposed
to
attacks
from
picardy
and
durham
the
patrimony
of
cuthbert
lay
as
a
sacred
boundary
between
england
and
scotland
northumberland
and
cumberland
were
still
a
debatable
ground
between
the
two
kingdoms
chester
was
held
by
its
earls
as
freely
by
the
sword
as
the
king
held
england
by
the
crown
no
lay
vassal
in
the
county
held
of
the
king
all
of
the
earl
in
shropshire
there
were
only
five
lay
tenants
besides
roger
montgomery
in
kent
bishop
odo
held
an
enormous
proportion
of
the
manors
but
the
nature
of
his
jurisdiction
is
not
very
clear
and
its
duration
is
too
short
to
make
it
of
much
importance
if
william
founded
any
earldoms
at
all
after
which
may
be
doubted
he
did
it
on
a
very
different
scale
the
hereditary
sheriffdoms
he
did
not
guard
against
with
equal
care
the
norman
viscounties
were
hereditary
and
there
was
some
risk
that
the
english
ones
would
become
so
too
and
with
the
worst
consequences
for
the
english
counties
were
much
larger
than
the
bailiwicks
of
the
norman
viscount
and
the
authority
of
the
sheriff
when
he
was
relieved
from
the
company
of
the
ealdorman
and
was
soon
to
lose
that
of
the
bishop
would
have
no
check
except
the
direct
control
of
the
king
if
william
perceived
this
it
was
too
late
to
prevent
it
entirely
some
of
the
sheriffdoms
became
hereditary
and
continued
to
be
so
long
after
the
abuse
had
become
constitutionally
dangerous
the
independence
of
the
greater
feudatories
was
still
further
limited
by
the
principle
which
the
conqueror
seems
to
have
observed
of
avoiding
the
accumulation
in
any
one
hand
of
a
great
number
of
contiguous
estates
the
rule
is
not
without
some
important
exceptions
and
it
may
have
been
suggested
by
the
diversity
of
occasions
on
which
the
fiefs
were
bestowed
but
the
result
is
one
which
william
must
have
foreseen
an
insubordinate
baron
whose
strength
lay
in
twelve
different
counties
would
have
to
rouse
the
suspicions
and
perhaps
to
defy
the
arms
of
twelve
powerful
sheriffs
before
he
could
draw
his
forces
to
a
head
in
his
manorial
courts
scattered
and
unconnected
he
could
set
up
no
central
tribunal
nor
even
force
a
new
custom
upon
his
tenants
nor
could
he
attempt
oppression
on
any
extensive
scale
by
such
limitation
the
people
were
protected
and
the
central
power
secured
yet
the
changes
of
ownership
even
thus
guarded
wrought
other
changes
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
norman
baron
when
he
had
received
his
fief
proceeded
to
carve
it
out
into
demesne
and
tenants
land
as
if
he
were
making
a
new
settlement
in
an
uninhabited
country
he
might
indeed
build
his
castle
and
enclose
his
chase
with
very
little
respect
to
the
rights
of
his
weaker
neighbors
but
he
did
not
attempt
any
such
radical
change
as
the
legal
theory
of
the
creation
of
manors
seems
to
presume
the
name
manor
is
of
norman
origin
but
the
estate
to
which
it
was
given
existed
in
its
essential
character
long
before
the
conquest
it
received
a
new
name
as
the
shire
also
did
but
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
was
created
by
this
change
the
local
jurisdictions
of
the
thegns
who
had
grants
of
and
or
who
exercised
judicial
functions
among
their
free
neighbors
were
identical
with
the
manorial
jurisdictions
of
the
new
owners
it
may
be
conjectured
with
great
probability
that
in
many
cases
the
weaker
freemen
who
had
either
willingly
or
under
constraint
attended
the
courts
of
their
great
neighbors
were
now
under
the
general
infusion
of
feudal
principle
regarded
as
holding
their
lands
of
them
as
lords
it
is
not
less
probable
that
in
a
great
number
of
grants
the
right
to
suit
and
service
from
small
passed
from
the
king
to
the
receiver
of
the
fief
as
a
matter
of
course
but
it
is
certain
that
even
before
the
conquest
such
a
proceeding
was
not
uncommon
edward
the
confessor
had
transferred
to
augustine
monastery
a
number
of
allodiaries
in
kent
and
every
such
measure
in
the
case
of
a
church
must
have
had
its
parallel
in
similar
grants
to
laymen
the
manorial
system
brought
in
a
number
of
new
names
and
perhaps
a
duplication
of
offices
the
of
the
old
thegn
or
of
the
ancient
township
was
replaced
as
president
of
the
courts
by
a
norman
steward
or
seneschal
and
the
of
the
old
system
by
the
bailiff
of
the
new
but
the
gerefa
and
bydel
still
continued
to
exist
in
a
subordinate
capacity
as
the
or
reeve
and
the
and
when
the
lord
steward
takes
his
place
in
the
county
court
the
reeve
and
four
men
of
the
township
are
there
also
the
common
of
the
township
may
be
treated
as
the
lord
waste
but
the
townsmen
do
not
lose
their
customary
share
the
changes
that
take
place
in
the
state
have
their
resulting
analogies
in
every
village
but
no
new
england
is
created
new
forms
displace
but
do
not
destroy
the
old
and
old
rights
remain
although
changed
in
title
and
forced
into
symmetry
with
a
new
legal
and
theory
the
changes
may
not
seem
at
first
sight
very
oppressive
but
they
opened
the
way
for
oppression
the
forms
they
had
introduced
tended
under
the
spirit
of
norman
legality
and
feudal
selfishness
to
become
hard
realities
and
in
the
profound
miseries
of
stephen
reign
the
people
learned
how
completely
the
new
theory
left
them
at
the
mercy
of
their
lords
nor
were
all
the
reforms
of
his
successor
more
stringent
or
the
struggles
of
the
century
that
followed
a
whit
more
impassioned
than
were
necessary
to
protect
the
english
yeoman
from
the
men
who
lived
upon
his
strength
in
attempting
thus
to
estimate
the
real
amount
of
change
introduced
by
the
feudalism
of
the
conquest
many
points
of
further
interest
have
been
touched
upon
to
which
it
is
necessary
to
recur
only
so
far
as
to
give
them
their
proper
place
in
a
more
general
view
of
the
reformed
organization
the
norman
king
is
still
the
king
of
the
nation
he
has
become
the
supreme
landlord
all
estates
are
held
of
him
mediately
or
immediately
but
he
still
demands
the
allegiance
of
all
his
subjects
the
oath
which
he
exacted
at
salisbury
in
and
which
is
embodied
in
the
form
already
quoted
was
a
modification
of
the
oath
taken
to
edmund
and
was
intended
to
set
the
general
obligation
of
obedience
to
the
king
in
its
proper
relation
to
the
new
tie
of
homage
and
fealty
by
which
the
tenant
was
bound
to
his
lord
all
men
continued
to
be
primarily
the
king
men
and
the
public
peace
to
be
his
peace
their
lords
might
demand
their
service
to
fulfil
their
own
obligations
but
the
king
could
call
them
to
the
summon
them
to
his
courts
and
tax
them
without
the
intervention
of
their
lords
and
to
the
king
they
could
look
for
protection
against
all
foes
accordingly
the
king
could
rely
on
the
help
of
the
bulk
of
the
free
people
in
all
struggles
with
his
feudatories
and
the
people
finding
that
their
connection
with
their
lords
would
be
no
excuse
for
unfaithfulness
to
the
king
had
a
further
inducement
to
adhere
to
the
more
permanent
institutions
in
the
department
of
law
the
direct
changes
introduced
by
the
conquest
were
not
great
much
that
is
regarded
as
peculiarly
norman
was
developed
upon
english
soil
and
although
originated
and
systematized
by
norman
lawyers
contained
elements
which
would
have
worked
in
a
very
different
way
in
normandy
even
the
vestiges
of
carlovingian
practice
which
appear
in
the
inquests
of
the
norman
reigns
are
modified
by
english
usage
the
great
inquest
of
all
the
survey
may
owe
its
principle
to
a
foreign
source
the
oath
of
the
reporters
may
be
norman
but
the
machinery
that
furnishes
the
jurors
is
native
the
king
barons
inquire
by
the
oath
of
the
sheriff
of
the
shire
and
of
all
the
barons
and
their
frenchmen
and
of
the
whole
hundred
the
priest
the
reeve
and
six
of
every
township
the
institution
of
the
collective
frank
pledge
which
recent
writers
incline
to
treat
as
a
norman
innovation
is
so
distinctly
colored
by
english
custom
that
it
has
been
generally
regarded
as
purely
indigenous
if
it
were
indeed
a
precaution
taken
by
the
new
rulers
against
the
avoidance
of
justice
by
the
absconding
or
harboring
of
criminals
it
fell
with
ease
into
the
usages
and
even
the
legal
terms
which
had
been
common
for
other
similar
purposes
since
the
reign
of
athelstan
the
trial
by
battle
which
on
clearer
evidence
seems
to
have
been
brought
in
by
the
normans
is
a
relic
of
old
teutonic
jurisprudence
the
absence
of
which
from
the
courts
is
far
more
curious
than
its
introduction
from
abroad
the
organization
of
jurisdiction
required
and
underwent
no
great
change
in
these
respects
the
norman
lord
who
undertook
the
office
of
sheriff
had
as
we
have
seen
more
unrestricted
power
than
the
sheriffs
of
old
he
was
the
king
representative
in
all
matters
judicial
military
and
financial
in
his
shire
and
had
many
opportunities
of
tyrannizing
in
each
of
those
departments
but
he
introduced
no
new
machinery
from
him
or
from
the
courts
of
which
he
was
the
presiding
officer
appeal
lay
to
the
king
alone
but
the
king
was
often
absent
from
england
and
did
not
understand
the
language
of
his
subjects
in
his
absence
the
administration
was
intrusted
to
a
a
regent
or
lieutenant
of
the
kingdom
and
the
convenience
being
once
ascertained
of
having
a
minister
who
could
in
the
whole
kingdom
represent
the
king
as
the
sheriff
did
in
the
shire
the
judiciar
became
a
permanent
functionary
this
however
can
not
be
certainly
affirmed
of
the
reign
of
the
conqueror
who
when
present
at
christmas
easter
and
whitsuntide
held
great
courts
of
justice
as
well
as
for
other
purposes
of
state
and
the
legal
importance
of
the
office
belongs
to
a
later
stage
the
royal
court
containing
the
of
the
crown
both
lay
and
clerical
and
entering
into
all
the
functions
of
the
witenagemot
was
the
supreme
council
of
the
nation
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
which
the
king
legislated
taxed
and
judged
in
the
one
authentic
monument
of
william
jurisprudence
the
act
which
removed
the
bishops
from
the
secular
courts
and
recognized
their
spiritual
jurisdictions
he
tells
us
that
he
acts
with
the
common
council
and
counsel
of
the
archbishops
bishops
abbots
and
all
the
princes
of
the
kingdom
the
ancient
summary
of
his
laws
contained
in
the
is
entitled
william
king
of
the
english
with
his
princes
enacted
after
the
conquest
of
and
the
same
form
is
preserved
in
the
tradition
of
his
confirming
the
ancient
laws
reported
to
him
by
the
representatives
of
the
shires
the
enumerates
the
classes
of
men
who
attended
his
great
courts
there
were
with
him
all
the
great
men
over
all
england
archbishops
and
bishops
abbots
and
earls
thegns
and
knights
the
great
suit
between
lanfranc
as
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
odo
as
earl
of
kent
which
is
perhaps
the
best
reported
trial
of
the
reign
was
tried
in
the
county
court
of
kent
before
the
king
representative
gosfrid
bishop
of
coutances
whose
presence
and
that
of
most
of
the
great
men
of
the
kingdom
seem
to
have
made
it
a
witenagemot
the
archbishop
pleaded
the
cause
of
his
church
in
a
session
of
three
days
on
pennenden
heath
the
aged
bishop
ethelric
was
brought
by
the
king
command
to
declare
the
ancient
customs
of
the
laws
and
with
him
several
other
englishmen
skilled
in
ancient
laws
and
customs
all
these
good
and
wise
men
supported
the
archbishop
claim
and
the
decision
was
agreed
on
and
determined
by
the
whole
county
the
sentence
was
laid
before
the
king
and
confirmed
by
him
here
we
have
probably
a
good
instance
of
the
principle
universally
adopted
all
the
lower
machinery
of
the
court
was
retained
entire
but
the
presence
of
the
norman
justiciar

himself
to
be
lacking
in
those
qualities
which
his
responsibilities

the
wants

demanded

had
great
obstacles

it

charles
found
it
a
task
far
beyond
his
abilities
to
construct
a
state
upon
foundations
of
unity
he
bore
many
titles
and
held
several
crowns
but
his
actual
dominion
was
narrowly
restricted
and
his
nominal
subjects
were
in
a
state
of
political
subdivision
almost
amounting
to
dismemberment

futile
efforts
during

let
us
leave
louis
the
debonair
his
traditional
name
although
it
is
not
an
exact
rendering
of
that
which
was
given
him
by
his
contemporaries
they
called
him
louis
the
pious
and
so
indeed
he
was
sincerely
and
even
scrupulously
pious
but
he
was
still
more
weak
than
pious
as
weak
in
heart
and
character
as
in
mind
as
destitute
of
ruling
ideas
as
of
strength
of
will
fluctuating
at
the
mercy
of
transitory
impressions
or
surrounding
influences
or
positional
embarrassments
the
name
of
is
suited
to
him
it
expresses
his
moral
worth
and
his
political
incapacity
both
at
once
as
king
of
aquitaine
in
the
time
of
charlemagne
louis
made
himself
esteemed
and
loved
his
justice
his
suavity
his
probity
and
his
piety
were
pleasing
to
the
people
and
his
weaknesses
disappeared
under
the
strong
hand
of
his
father
when
he
became
emperor
he
began
his
reign
by
a
reaction
against
the
excesses
real
or
supposed
of
the
preceding
reign
charlemagne
morals
were
far
from
regular
and
he
troubled
himself
but
little
about
the
license
prevailing
in
his
family
or
his
palace
at
a
distance
he
ruled
with
a
tight
and
heavy
hand
louis
established
at
his
court
for
his
sisters
as
well
as
his
servants
austere
regulations
he
restored
to
the
subjugated
saxons
certain
of
the
rights
of
which
charlemagne
had
deprived
them
he
sent
out
everywhere
his
commissioners
with
orders
to
listen
to
complaints
and
redress
grievances
and
to
mitigate
his
father
rule
which
was
rigorous
in
its
application
and
yet
insufficient
to
repress
disturbance
notwithstanding
its
preventive
purpose
and
its
watchful
supervision
almost
simultaneously
with
his
accession
louis
committed
an
act
more
serious
and
compromising
he
had
by
his
wife
hermengarde
three
sons
lothair
pépin
and
louis
aged
respectively
nineteen
eleven
and
eight
in
louis
summoned
at
the
general
assembly
of
his
dominions
and
there
while
declaring
that
neither
to
those
who
were
wisely
minded
nor
to
himself
did
it
appear
expedient
to
break
up
for
the
love
he
bare
his
sons
and
by
the
will
of
man
the
unity
of
the
empire
preserved
by
god
himself
he
had
resolved
to
share
with
his
eldest
son
lothair
the
imperial
throne
lothair
was
in
fact
crowned
emperor
and
his
two
brothers
pépin
and
louis
were
crowned
king
in
order
that
they
might
reign
after
their
father
death
and
under
their
brother
and
lord
lothair
to
wit
pépin
over
aquitaine
and
a
great
part
of
southern
gaul
and
of
burgundy
louis
beyond
the
rhine
over
bavaria
and
the
divers
peoples
in
the
east
of
germany
the
rest
of
gaul
and
of
germany
as
well
as
the
kingdom
of
italy
was
to
belong
to
lothair
emperor
and
head
of
the
frankish
monarchy
to
whom
his
brothers
would
have
to
repair
year
by
year
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
him
and
receive
his
instructions
the
kingdom
the
most
considerable
of
the
three
remained
under
the
direct
government
of
louis
the
debonair
and
at
the
same
time
of
his
son
lothair
sharing
the
title
of
emperor
the
two
other
sons
pépin
and
louis
entered
notwithstanding
their
childhood
upon
immediate
possession
the
one
of
aquitaine
and
the
other
of
bavaria
under
the
superior
authority
of
their
father
and
their
brother
the
joint
emperors
charlemagne
had
vigorously
maintained
the
unity
of
the
empire
for
all
that
he
had
delegated
to
two
of
his
sons
pépin
and
louis
the
government
of
italy
and
aquitaine
with
the
title
of
king
louis
the
debonair
while
regulating
beforehand
the
division
of
his
dominion
likewise
desired
as
he
said
to
maintain
the
unity
of
the
empire
but
he
forgot
that
he
was
no
charlemagne
it
was
not
long
before
numerous
mournful
experiences
showed
to
what
extent
the
unity
of
the
empire
required
personal
superiority
in
the
emperor
and
how
rapid
would
be
the
decay
of
the
fabric
when
there
remained
nothing
but
the
title
of
the
founder
in
pope
stephen
iv
came
to
france
to
consecrate
louis
the
debonair
emperor
many
a
time
already
the
popes
had
rendered
the
frankish
kings
this
service
and
honor
the
franks
had
been
proud
to
see
their
king
charlemagne
protecting
adrian
i
against
the
lombards
then
crowned
emperor
at
rome
by
leo
iii
and
then
having
his
two
sons
pépin
and
louis
crowned
at
rome
by
the
same
pope
kings
respectively
of
italy
and
of
aquitaine
on
these
different
occasions
charlemagne
while
testifying
the
most
profound
respect
for
the
pope
had
in
his
relations
with
him
always
taken
care
to
preserve
together
with
his
political
greatness
all
his
personal
dignity
but
when
in
the
franks
saw
louis
the
pious
not
only
go
out
of
rheims
to
meet
stephen
iv
but
prostrate
himself
from
head
to
foot
and
rise
only
when
the
pope
held
out
a
hand
to
him
the
spectators
felt
saddened
and
humiliated
at
the
sight
of
their
emperor
in
the
posture
of
a
penitent
monk
several
insurrections
burst
out
in
the
empire
the
first
among
the
basques
of
aquitaine
the
next
in
italy
where
bernard
son
of
pépin
having
after
his
father
death
become
king
in
with
the
consent
of
his
grandfather
charlemagne
could
not
quietly
see
his
kingdom
pass
into
the
hands
of
his
cousin
lothair
at
the
orders
of
his
uncle
louis
these
two
attempts
were
easily
repressed
but
the
third
was
more
serious
it
took
place
in
brittany
among
those
populations
of
armorica
who
were
still
buried
in
their
woods
and
were
excessively
jealous
of
their
independence
in
they
took
for
king
one
of
their
principal
chieftains
named
morvan
and
not
confining
themselves
to
a
refusal
of
all
tribute
to
the
king
of
the
franks
they
renewed
their
ravages
upon
the
frankish
territories
bordering
on
their
frontier
louis
was
at
that
time
holding
a
general
assembly
of
his
dominions
at
and
count
lantbert
commandant
of
the
marches
of
brittany
came
and
reported
to
him
what
was
going
on
a
frankish
monk
named
ditcar
happened
to
be
at
the
assembly
he
was
a
man
of
piety
and
sense
a
friend
of
peace
and
moreover
with
some
knowledge
of
the
breton
king
morvan
as
his
monastery
had
property
in
the
neighborhood
him
the
emperor
commissioned
to
convey
to
the
king
his
grievances
and
his
demands
after
some
journey
the
monk
passed
the
frontier
and
arrived
at
a
vast
space
enclosed
on
one
side
by
a
noble
river
and
on
all
the
others
by
forests
and
swamps
hedges
and
ditches
in
the
middle
of
this
space
was
a
large
dwelling
which
was
morvan
ditcar
found
it
full
of
warriors
the
king
having
no
doubt
some
expedition
on
hand
the
monk
announced
himself
as
a
messenger
from
the
emperor
of
the
franks
the
style
of
announcement
caused
some
confusion
at
first
to
the
briton
who
however
hastened
to
conceal
his
emotion
under
an
air
of
and
joyousness
to
impose
upon
his
comrades
the
latter
were
got
rid
of
and
the
king
remained
alone
with
the
monk
who
explained
the
object
of
his
mission
he
descanted
upon
the
power
of
the
emperor
louis
recounted
his
complaints
and
warned
the
briton
kindly
and
in
a
private
capacity
of
the
danger
of
his
situation
a
danger
so
much
the
greater
in
that
he
and
his
people
would
meet
with
the
less
consideration
seeing
that
they
kept
up
the
religion
of
their
pagan
forefathers
morvan
gave
attentive
ear
to
this
sermon
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
and
his
foot
tapping
it
from
time
to
time
ditcar
thought
he
had
succeeded
but
an
incident
supervened
it
was
the
hour
when
morvan
wife
was
accustomed
to
come
and
look
for
him
ere
they
retired
to
the
nuptial
couch
she
appeared
eager
to
know
who
the
stranger
was
what
he
had
come
for
what
he
had
said
what
answer
he
had
received
she
preluded
her
questions
with
oglings
and
caresses
she
kissed
the
knees
the
hands
the
beard
and
the
face
of
the
king
testifying
her
desire
to
be
alone
with
him
o
king
and
glory
of
the
mighty
britons
dear
spouse
of
mine
what
tidings
bringeth
this
stranger
is
it
peace
or
is
it
war
this
stranger
answered
morvan
with
a
smile
is
an
envoy
of
the
franks
but
bring
he
peace
or
bring
he
war
is
the
affair
of
men
alone
as
for
thee
content
thee
with
thy
woman
duties
thereupon
ditcar
perceiving
that
he
was
countered
said
to
morvan
sir
king
is
time
that
i
return
tell
me
what
answer
i
am
to
take
back
to
my
sovereign
leave
me
this
night
to
take
thought
thereon
replied
the
breton
chief
with
a
wavering
air
when
the
morning
came
ditcar
presented
himself
once
more
to
morvan
whom
he
found
up
but
still
half
drunk
and
full
of
very
different
sentiments
from
those
of
the
night
before
it
required
some
effort
stupefied
and
tottering
as
he
was
with
the
effects
of
wine
and
the
pleasures
of
the
night
to
say
to
ditcar
go
back
to
thy
king
and
tell
him
from
me
that
my
land
was
never
his
and
that
i
owe
him
naught
of
tribute
or
submission
let
him
reign
over
the
franks
as
for
me
i
reign
over
the
britons
if
he
will
bring
war
on
me
he
will
find
me
ready
to
pay
him
back
the
monk
returned
to
louis
the
debonair
and
rendered
account
of
his
mission
war
was
resolved
upon
and
the
emperor
collected
his
troops
alemannians
saxons
thuringians
burgundians
and
aquitanians
without
counting
franks
or
they
began
their
march
moving
upon
vannes
louis
was
at
their
head
and
the
empress
accompanied
him
but
he
left
her
already
ill
and
fatigued
at
angers
the
franks
entered
the
country
of
the
britons
searched
the
woods
and
morasses
found
no
armed
men
in
the
open
country
but
encountered
them
in
scattered
and
scanty
companies
at
the
entrance
of
all
the
defiles
on
the
heights
commanding
pathways
and
wherever
men
could
hide
themselves
and
await
the
moment
for
appearing
unexpectedly
the
franks
heard
them
from
amid
the
heather
and
the
brushwood
uttering
shrill
cries
to
give
warning
one
to
another
or
to
alarm
the
enemy
the
franks
advanced
cautiously
and
at
last
arrived
at
the
entrance
of
the
thick
wood
which
surrounded
morvan
abode
he
had
not
yet
set
out
with
the
pick
of
the
warriors
he
had
about
him
but
at
the
approach
of
the
franks
he
summoned
his
wife
and
his
domestics
and
said
to
them
defend
ye
well
this
house
and
these
woods
as
for
me
i
am
going
to
march
forward
to
collect
my
people
after
which
to
return
but
not
without
booty
and
spoils
he
put
on
his
armor
took
a
javelin
in
each
hand
and
mounted
his
horse
thou
seest
said
he
to
his
wife
these
javelins
i
brandish
i
will
bring
them
back
to
thee
this
very
day
dyed
with
the
blood
of
franks
farewell
setting
out
he
pierced
followed
by
his
men
through
the
thickness
of
the
forest
and
advanced
to
meet
the
franks
the
battle
began
the
large
numbers
of
the
franks
who
covered
the
ground
for
some
distance
dismayed
the
britons
and
many
of
them
fled
seeking
where
they
might
hide
themselves
morvan
beside
himself
with
rage
and
at
the
head
of
his
most
devoted
followers
rushed
down
upon
the
franks
as
if
to
demolish
them
at
a
single
stroke
and
many
fell
beneath
his
blows
he
singled
out
a
warrior
of
inferior
grade
toward
whom
he
made
at
a
gallop
and
insulting
him
by
word
of
mouth
after
the
ancient
fashion
of
the
celtic
warriors
cried
frank
i
am
going
to
give
thee
my
first
present
a
present
which
i
have
been
keeping
for
thee
a
long
while
and
which
i
hope
thou
wilt
bear
in
mind
and
launched
at
him
a
javelin
which
the
other
received
on
his
shield
proud
briton
replied
the
frank
i
have

into

galloped
down
upon
morvan
who
clad
though
he
was
in
a
coat
of
mail
fell
pierced
by
the
thrust
of
a
lance
the
frank
had
but
time
to
dismount
and
cut
off
his
head
when
he
fell

wounded
by

of

young
warriors

not
without
having
in
his
turn
dealt
the
other
his
deathblow
it
spreads
on
all
sides
that
morvan
is
dead

the
franks
come
thronging
to
the
scene
of
the
encounter
there
is
picked
up
and
passed
from

all
bloody
and
fearfully
disfigured

the
monk
is
called
to
see
it
and
to
say
whether
it
is
that
of
morvan
but
he
has
to
wash
the
mass
of
disfigurement
and
to
partially
adjust
the
hair
before
he
can
pronounce
that
it
is
really
morvan

on
arriving
at
angers
louis
found
the
empress
hermengarde
dying
and
two
days
afterward
she
was
dead
he
had
a
tender
heart
which
was
not
proof
against
sorrow
and
he
testified
a
desire
to
abdicate
and
turn
monk
but
he
was
dissuaded
from
his
purpose
for
it
was
easy
to
influence
his
resolutions
a
little
later
he
was
advised
to
marry
again
and
he
yielded

princesses

introduced
and
he
chose

times

the
passion
for
ruling
louis
during
his
expedition
into
brittany
had
just
witnessed
the
fatal
result
of
a
woman
empire
over
her
husband
he
was
destined
himself
to
offer
a
more
striking
and
more
example
of
it
in
he
had
by
his
new
empress
judith
a
son
whom
he
called
charles
and
who
was
hereafter
to
be
known
as
charles
the

the
source
of
his

woes
his
birth
could
not
fail
to
cause
and
mistrust
in
louis
three
sons
by
hermengarde
who
were
already
kings
they
had
but
a
short
time
previously
received
the
first
proof
of
their
father
weakness
in
louis
repenting
of
his
severity
toward
his
nephew
bernard
of
italy
whose
eyes
he
had
caused
to
be
put
out
as
a
punishment
for
rebellion
and
who
had
died
in
consequence
considered
himself
bound
to
perform
at
attigny
in
the
church
and
before
the
people
a
solemn
act
of
penance
which
was
creditable
to
his
honesty
and
piety
but
the
details
left
upon
the
minds
of
the
beholders
an
impression
unfavorable
to
the
emperor
dignity
and
authority
in
during
an
assembly
held
at
worms
he
yielding
to
his
wife
entreaties
and
doubtless
also
to
his
own
yearnings
toward
his
youngest
son
set
at
naught
the
solemn
act
whereby
in
he
had
shared
his
dominions
among
his
three
elder
sons
and
took
away
from
two
of
them
in
burgundy
and
alemannia
some
of
the
territories
he
had
assigned
to
them
and
gave
them
to
the
boy
charles
for
his
share
lothair
pépin
and
louis
thereupon
revolted
court
rivalries
were
added
to
family
differences
the
emperor
had
summoned
to
his
side
a
young
southron
bernard
by
name
duke
of
septimania
and
son
of
count
william
of
toulouse
who
had
gallantly
fought
the
saracens
he
made
him
his
chief
chamberlain
and
his
favorite
counsellor
bernard
was
bold
ambitious
vain
imperious
and
restless
he
removed
his
rivals
from
court
and
put
in
their
places
his
own
creatures
he
was
accused
not
only
of
abusing
the
emperor
favor
but
even
of
carrying
on
a
guilty
intrigue
with
the
empress
judith
there
grew
up
against
him
and
by
consequence
against
the
emperor
the
empress
and
their
youngest
son
a
powerful
opposition
in
which
certain
ecclesiastics
and
among
them
wala
abbot
of
corbie
and
but
lately
one
of
the
privy
counsellors
of
charlemagne
joined
eagerly
some
had
at
heart
the
unity
of
the
empire
which
louis
was
breaking
up
more
and
more
others
were
concerned
for
the
spiritual
interests
of
the
church
which
louis
in
spite
of
his
piety
and
by
reason
of
his
weakness
often
permitted
to
be
attacked
thus
strengthened
the
conspirators
considered
themselves
certain
of
success
they
had
the
empress
judith
carried
off
and
shut
up
in
the
convent
of
radegonde
at
poitiers
and
louis
in
person
came
to
deliver
himself
up
to
them
at
compiègne
where
they
were
assembled
there
they
passed
a
decree
to
the
effect
that
the
power
and
title
of
emperor
were
transferred
from
louis
to
lothair
his
eldest
son
that
the
act
whereby
a
share
of
the
empire
had
but
lately
been
assigned
to
charles
was
annulled
and
that
the
act
of
which
had
regulated
the
partition
of
louis
dominions
after
his
death
was
once
more
in
force
but
soon
there
was
a
burst
of
reaction
in
favor
of
the
emperor
lothair
two
brothers
jealous
of
his
late
elevation
made
overtures
to
their
father
the
ecclesiastics
were
a
little
ashamed
at
being
mixed
up
in
a
revolt
the
people
felt
pity
for
the
poor
honest
emperor
and
a
general
assembly
meeting
at
nimeguen
abolished
the
acts
of
compiègne
and
restored
to
louis
his
title
and
his
power
but
it
was
not
long
before
there
was
revolt
again
originating
this
time
with
pépin
king
of
aquitaine
louis
fought
him
and
gave
aquitaine
to
charles
the
bald
the
alliance
between
the
three
sons
of
hermengarde
was
at
once
renewed
they
raised
an
army
the
emperor
marched
against
them
with
his
and
the
two
hosts
met
between
colmar
and
bâle
in
a
place
called
champ
the
field
of
red
negotiations
were
set
on
foot
and
louis
was
called
upon
to
leave
his
wife
judith
and
his
son
charles
and
put
himself
under
the
guardianship
of
his
elder
sons
he
refused
but
just
when
the
conflict
was
about
to
commence
desertion
took
place
in
army
most
of
the
prelates
laics
and
who
had
accompanied
him
passed
over
to
the
camp
of
lothair
and
the
field
of
red
became
the
field
of
falsehood
champ
du
louis
left
almost
alone
ordered
his
attendants
to
withdraw
being
unwilling
he
said
that
any
one
of
them
should
lose
life
or
limb
on
his
account
and
surrendered
to
his
sons
they
received
him
with
great
demonstrations
of
respect
but
without
relinquishing
the
prosecution
of
their
enterprise
lothair
hastily
collected
an
assembly
which
proclaimed
him
emperor
with
the
addition
of
divers
territories
to
the
kingdoms
of
aquitaine
and
bavaria
and
three
months
afterward
another
assembly
meeting
at
compiègne
declared
the
emperor
louis
to
have
forfeited
the
crown
for
having
by
his
faults
and
incapacity
suffered
to
sink
so
sadly
low
the
empire
which
had
been
raised
to
grandeur
and
brought
into
unity
by
charlemagne
and
his
predecessors
louis
submitted
to
this
decision
himself
read
out
aloud
in
the
church
of
médard
at
soissons
but
not
quite
unresistingly
a
confession
in
eight
articles
of
his
faults
and
laying
his
baldric
upon
the
altar
stripped
off
his
royal
robe
and
received
from
the
hands
of
ebbo
archbishop
of
rheims
the
gray
vestment
of
a
penitent
lothair
considered
his
father
dethroned
for
good
and
himself
henceforth
sole
emperor
but
he
was
mistaken
for
years
longer
the
scenes
which
have
just
been
described
kept
repeating
themselves
again
and
again
rivalries
and
secret
plots
began
once
more
between
the
three
victorious
brothers
and
their
partisans
popular
feeling
revived
in
favor
of
louis
a
large
portion
of
the
clergy
shared
it
several
counts
of
neustria
and
burgundy
appeared
in
arms
in
the
name
of
the
deposed
emperor
and
the
seductive
and
able
judith
came
afresh
upon
the
scene
and
gained
over
to
the
cause
of
her
husband
and
her
son
a
multitude
of
friends
in
two
assemblies
one
meeting
at
denis
and
the
other
at
thionville
annulled
all
the
acts
of
the
assembly
of
compiègne
and
for
the
third
time
put
louis
in
possession
of
the
imperial
title
and
power
he
displayed
no
violence
in
his
use
of
it
but
he
was
growing
more
and
more
irresolute
and
weak
when
in
the
second
of
his
rebellious
sons
pépin
king
of
aquitaine
died
suddenly
louis
ever
under
the
sway
of
judith
speedily
convoked
at
worms
in
once
more
and
for
the
last
time
a
general
assembly
whereat
leaving
his
son
louis
of
bavaria
reduced
to
his
kingdom
in
eastern
europe
he
divided
the
rest
of
his
dominions
into
two
nearly
equal
parts
separated
by
the
course
of
the
meuse
and
the
rhone
between
these
two
parts
he
left
the
choice
to
lothair
who
took
the
eastern
portion
promising
at
the
same
time
to
guarantee
the
western
portion
to
his
younger
brother
charles
louis
the
germanic
protested
against
this
partition
and
took
up
arms
to
resist
it
his
father
the
emperor
set
himself
in
motion
toward
the
rhine
to
reduce
him
to
submission
but
on
arriving
close
to
mayence
he
caught
a
violent
fever
and
died
on
the
of
june
at
the
castle
ingelheim
on
a
little
island
in
the
river
his
last
acts
were
a
fresh
proof
of
his
goodness
toward
even
his
rebellious
sons
and
of
his
solicitude
for
his
he
sent
to
louis
the
germanic
his
pardon
and
to
lothair
the
golden
crown
and
sword
at
the
same
time
bidding
him
fulfil
his
father
wishes
on
behalf
of
charles
and
judith
there
is
no
telling
whether
in
the
credulousness
of
his
good
nature
louis
had
at
his
dying
hour
any
great
confidence
in
the
appeal
he
made
to
his
son
lothair
and
in
the
impression
which
would
be
produced
on
his
other
son
louis
of
bavaria
by
the
pardon
bestowed
the
prayers
of
the
dying
are
of
little
avail
against
violent
passions
and
barbaric
manners
scarcely
was
louis
the
debonair
dead
when
lothair
was
already
conspiring
against
young
charles
and
was
in
secret
alliance
for
his
despoilment
with
pépin
ii
the
late
king
of
aquitaine
son
who
had
taken
up
arms
for
the
purpose
of
seizing
his
father
kingdom
in
the
possession
of
which
his
grandfather
louis
had
not
been
pleased
to
confirm
him
charles
suddenly
learned
that
his
mother
judith
was
on
the
point
of
being
besieged
in
poitiers
by
the
aquitanians
and
in
spite
of
the
friendly
protestations
sent
to
him
by
lothair
it
was
not
long
before
he
discovered
the
plot
formed
against
him
he
was
not
wanting
in
shrewdness
or
energy
and
having
first
provided
for
his
safety
he
set
about
forming
an
alliance
in
the
cause
of
their
common
interests
with
his
other
brother
louis
the
germanic
who
was
equally
in
danger
from
the
ambition
of
lothair
the
historians
of
the
period
do
not
say
what
negotiator
was
employed
by
charles
on
this
distant
and
delicate
mission
but
several
circumstances
indicate
that
the
empress
judith
herself
undertook
it
that
she
went
in
quest
of
the
king
of
bavaria
and
that
it
was
she
who
with
her
accustomed
grace
and
address
determined
him
to
make
common
cause
with
his
youngest
against
their
eldest
brother
divers
incidents
retarded
for
a
whole
year
the
outburst
of
this
family
plot
and
of
the
war
of
which
it
was
the
precursor
the
position
of
the
young
king
charles
appeared
for
some
time
a
very
bad
one
but
certain
chieftains
says
the
historian
nithard
faithful
to
his
mother
and
to
him
and
having
nothing
more
to
lose
than
life
or
limb
chose
rather
to
die
gloriously
than
to
betray
their
king
the
arrival
of
louis
the
germanic
with
his
troops
helped
to
swell
the
forces
and
increase
the
confidence
of
charles
and
it
was
on
the
of
june
exactly
a
year
after
the
death
of
louis
the
debonair
that
the
two
armies
that
of
lothair
and
pépin
on
the
one
side
and
that
of
charles
the
bald
and
louis
the
germanic
on
the
other
stood
face
to
face
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
village
of
fontenailles
six
leagues
from
auxerre
on
the
rivulet
of
audries
never
according
to
such
evidence
as
is
forthcoming
since
the
battle
on
the
plains
of
châlons
against
the
huns
and
that
of
poitiers
against
the
saracens
had
so
great
masses
of
men
been
engaged
there
would
be
nothing
untruthlike
says
that
scrupulous
authority
fauriel
in
putting
the
whole
number
of
combatants
at
three
hundred
thousand
and
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
either
of
the
two
armies
was
much
less
numerous
than
the
other
however
that
may
be
the
leaders
hesitated
for
four
days
to
come
to
blows
and
while
they
were
hesitating
the
old
favorite
not
only
of
louis
the
debonair
but
also
according
to
several
chroniclers
of
the
empress
judith
held
himself
aloof
with
his
troops
in
the
vicinity
having
made
equal
promise
of
assistance
to
both
sides
and
waiting
to
govern
his
decision
for
the
prospect
afforded
by
the
first
conflict
the
battle
began
on
the
of
june
at
daybreak
and
was
at
first
in
favor
of
lothair
but
the
troops
of
charles
the
bald
recovered
the
advantage
which
had
been
lost
by
those
of
louis
the
germanic
and
the
action
was
soon
nothing
but
a
terribly
simple
scene
of
carnage
between
enormous
masses
of
men
charging
hand
to
hand
again
and
again
with
a
front
extending
over
a
couple
of
leagues
before
midday
the
slaughter
the
plunder
the
spoliation
of
the
dead
all
was
over
the
victory
of
charles
and
louis
was
complete
the
victors
had
retired
to
their
camp
and
there
remained
nothing
on
the
field
of
battle
but
corpses
in
thick
heaps
or
a
long
line
according
as
they
had
fallen
in
the
disorder
of
flight
or
steadily
fighting
in
their
ranks

appeared
a
decisive

made
zealous
efforts
to
continue
the
struggle
he
scoured
the
countries
wherein
he
hoped
to
find
partisans
to
the
saxons
he
promised
the
unrestricted
reëstablishment
of
their
pagan
worship
and
several
of
the
saxon
tribes
responded
to
his
appeal
louis
the
germanic
and
charles
the
bald
having
information
of
these
preliminaries
resolved
to
solemnly
renew
their
alliance
and
seven
months
after
their
victory
at
fontenailles
in
february
they
repaired
both
of
them
each
with
his
army
to
argentaria
on
the
right
bank
of
the
rhine
between
bâle
and
strasburg
and
there
at
an
meeting
louis
first
addressing
the
chieftains
about
him
in
the
german
tongue
said
ye
all
know
how
often
since
our
father
death
lothair
hath
attacked
us
in
order
to
destroy
us
this
my
brother
and
me
having
never
been
able
as
brothers
and
christians
or
in
any
just
way
to
obtain
peace
from
him
we
were
constrained
to
appeal
to
the
judgment
of
god
lothair
was
beaten
and
retired
whither
he
could
with
his
following
for
we
restrained
by
paternal
affection
and
moved
with
compassion
for
christian
people
were
unwilling
to
pursue
them
to
extermination
neither
then
nor
aforetime
did
we
demand
aught
else
save
that
each
of
us
should
be
maintained
in
his

he
rebelling
against
the
judgment
of

ceaseth
not
to
attack
us
as
enemies
this
my

and
me
and
he
destroyeth
our
peoples
with
fire
and

as
we
trow
that
ye
doubt
the

of

we
have
resolved

afresh
by
this
oath
in

led
thereto
by
no
prompting
of
wicked
covetousness

only
that

charles
repeated
this
speech
word
for
word
to
his
own
troops
in
the
romance
language
in
that
idiom
derived
from
a
mixture
of
latin
and
of
the
tongues
of
ancient
gaul
and
spoken
thenceforth
with
varieties
of
dialect
and
pronunciation
in
nearly
all
parts
of
frankish
gaul
after
this
address
louis
pronounced
and
charles
repeated
after
him
each
in
his
own
tongue
the
oath
couched
in
these
terms
for
the
love
of
god
for
the
christian
people
and
for
our
common
weal
from
this
day
forth
and
so
long
as
god
shall
grant
me
power
and
knowledge
i
will
defend
this
my
brother
and
will
be
an
aid
to
him
in
everything
as
one
ought
to
defend
his
brother
provided
that
he
do
likewise
unto
me
and
i
will
never
make
with
lothair
any
covenant
which
may
be
to
my
knowledge
to
the
damage
of
this
my
brother
when
the
two
brothers
had
thus
sworn
the
two
armies
officers
and
men
took
in
their
turn
a
similar
oath
going
bail
in
a
mass
for
the
engagements
of
their
kings
then
they
took
up
their
quarters
all
of
them
for
some
time
between
worms
and
mayence
and
followed
up
their
political
proceeding
with
military
fêtes
precursors
of
the
knightly
tournaments
of
the
middle
ages
a
place
of
meeting
was
fixed
says
the
contemporary
historian
nithard
at
a
spot
suitable
for
this
kind
of
exercises
here
were
drawn
up
on
one
side
a
certain
number
of
combatants
saxons
vasconians
austrasians
or
britons
there
were
ranged
on
the
opposite
side
an
equal
number
of
warriors
and
the
two
divisions
advanced
each
against
the
other
as
if
to
attack
one
of
them
with
their
bucklers
at
their
backs
took
to
flight
as
if
to
seek
in
the
main
body
shelter
against
those
who
were
pursuing
them
then
suddenly
facing
about
they
dashed
out
in
pursuit
of
those
before
whom
they
had
just
been
flying
this
sport
lasted
until
the
two
kings
appearing
with
all
the
youth
of
their
suites
rode
up
at
a
gallop
brandishing
their
spears
and
chasing
first
one
lot
and
then
the
other
it
was
a
fine
sight
to
see
so
much
temper
among
so
many
valiant
folk
for
great
as
was
the
number
and
the
mixture
of
different
nationalities
no
one
was
insulted
or
maltreated
though
the
contrary
is
often
the
case
among
men
in
small
numbers
and
known
one
to
another
after
four
or
five
months
of
tentative
measures
or
of
incidents
which
taught
both
parties
that
they
could
not
either
of
them
hope
to
completely
destroy
their
opponents
the
two
allied
brothers
received
at
verdun
whither
they
had
repaired
to
concert
their
next
movement
a
messenger
from
lothair
with
peaceful
proposals
which
they
were
unwilling
to
reject
the
principal
was
that
with
the
exception
of
italy
aquitaine
and
bavaria
to
be
secured
without
dispute
to
their
then
possessors
the
frankish
empire
should
be
divided
into
three
portions
that
the
arbiters
elected
to
preside
over
the
partition
should
swear
to
make
it
as
equal
as
possible
and
that
lothair
should
have
his
choice
with
the
title
of
emperor
about
the
three
brothers
met
on
an
island
of
the
saône
near
châlons
where
they
began
to
discuss
the
questions
which
divided
them
but
it
was
not
till
more
than
a
year
after
in
august
that
assembling
all
three
of
them
with
their
umpires
at
verdun
they
at
last
came
to
an
agreement
about
the
partition
of
the
frankish
empire
save
the
three
countries
which
it
had
been
beforehand
agreed
to
accept

all
the
provinces

he
was
already
in

besides
on

rhine
the
towns
of

and

with
the
territory
appertaining
to

the
eastern

with

a
special

subordinated
to
the
general
government
of
the
empire
but
distinct
from
it

this
last
remnant
of
their
nationality
and
became
integral

of
frankish

which
fell
by
partition
to
charles

and
formed
one
and
the

designs
the

of

by

of

frankish
and
christian
masters
of

the

of
still
retained
a
certain
value
in
the
minds
of
the
people
and
still
remained
an
object
of
ambition
to
princes
but
the
empire
was
completely
abolished
and
in
its
stead
sprang
up
three
kingdoms
independent
one
of
another
without
any
necessary
connection
or
relation
one
of
the
three
was
thenceforth
france
in
this
great
event
are
comprehended
two
facts
the
disappearance
of
the
empire
and
the
formation
of
the
three
kingdoms
which
took
its
place
the
first
is
easily
explained
the
resuscitation
of
the
roman
empire
had
been
a
dream
of
ambition
and
ignorance
on
the
part
of
a
great
man
but
a
barbarian
political
unity
and
central
absolute
power
had
been
the
essential
characteristics
of
that
empire
they
became
introduced
and
established
through
a
long
succession
of
ages
on
the
ruins
of
the
splendid
roman
republic
destroyed
by
its
own
dissensions
under
favor
of
the
still
great
influence
of
the
old
roman
senate
though
fallen
from
its
high
estate
and
beneath
the
guardianship
of
the
roman
legions
and
imperial
praetorians
not
one
of
these
conditions
not
one
of
these
forces
was
to
be
met
with
in
the
roman
world
reigned
over
by
charlemagne
the
nation
of
the
franks
and
charlemagne
himself
were
but
of
yesterday
the
new
emperor
had
neither
ancient
senate
to
hedge
at
the
same
time
that
it
obeyed
him
nor
old
bodies
of
troops
to
support
him
political
unity
and
absolute
power
were
repugnant
alike
to
the
intellectual
and
the
social
condition
to
the
national
manners
and
personal
sentiments
of
the
victorious
barbarians
the
necessity
of
placing
their
conquests
beyond
the
reach
of
a
new
swarm
of
barbarians
and
the
personal
ascendency
of
charlemagne
were
the
only
things
which
gave
his
government
a
momentary
gleam
of
success
in
the
way
of
unity
and
of
factitious
despotism
under
the
name
of
empire
in
charlemagne
had
made
territorial
security
an
accomplished
fact
but
the
personal
power
he
had
exercised
disappeared
with
him
the
new
community
recovered
under
the
mighty
but
gradual
influence
of
christianity
its
proper
and
natural
course
producing
disruption
into
different
local
communities
and
bold
struggles
for
individual
liberties
either
one
with
another
or
against
whosoever
tried
to
become
their
master
as
for
the
second
fact
the
formation
of
the
three
kingdoms
which
were
the
issue
of
the
treaty
of
verdun
various
explanations
have
been
given
of
it
this
distribution
of
certain
peoples
of
western
europe
into
three
distinct
and
independent
groups
italians
germans
and
french
has
been
attributed
at
one
time
to
a
diversity
of
histories
and
manners
at
another
to
geographical
causes
and
to
what
is
called
the
rule
of
natural
frontiers
and
oftener
still
to
a
spirit
of
nationality
and
to
differences
of
language
let
none
of
these
causes
be
gainsaid
they
all
exercised
some
sort
of
influence
but
they
are
all
incomplete
in
themselves
and
far
too
redolent
of
theoretical
system
it
is
true
that
germany
france
and
italy
began
at
that
time
to
emerge
from
the
chaos
into
which
they
had
been
plunged
by
barbaric
invasion
and
the
conquests
of
charlemagne
and
to
form
themselves
into
quite
distinct
nations
but
there
were
in
each
of
the
kingdoms
of
lothair
of
louis
the
germanic
and
of
charles
the
bald
populations
widely
differing
in
race
language
manners
and
geographical
affinity
and
it
required
many
great
events
and
the
lapse
of
many
centuries
to
bring
about
the
degree
of
national
unity
they
now
possess
to
say
nothing
touching
the
agency
of
individual
and
independent
forces
which
is
always
considerable
although
so
many
men
of
intellect
ignore
it
in
the
present
day
what
would
have
happened
had
any
one
of
the
three
new
kings
lothair
or
louis
the
germanic
or
charles
the
bald
been
a
second
charlemagne
as
charlemagne
had
been
a
second
charles
martel
who
can
say
that
in
such
a
case
the
three
kingdoms
would
have
taken
the
form
they
took
in
happily
or
unhappily
it
was
not
so
none
of
charlemagne
successors
was
capable
of
exercising
on
the
events
of
his
time
by
virtue
of
his
brain
and
his
own
will
any
notable
influence
attempts
at
foreign
invasion
of
france
were
renewed
very
often
and
in
many
parts
of
territory
during
the
whole
duration
of
the
carlovingian
dynasty
and
even
though
they
failed
they
caused
the
population
of
the
kingdom
to
suffer
from
cruel
ravages
charlemagne
even
after
his
successes
against
the
different
barbaric
invaders
had
foreseen
the
evils
which
would
be
inflicted
on
france
by
the
most
formidable
and
most
determined
of
them
the
northmen
coming
by
sea
and
landing
on
the
coast
the
most
closely
contemporaneous
and
most
given
to
detail
of
his
chroniclers
the
monk
of
gall
tells
in
prolix
and
pompous
but
evidently
heartfelt
and
sincere
terms
the
tale
of
the
great
emperor
farsightedness
charles
who
was
ever
astir
says
he
arrived
by
mere
hap
and
unexpectedly
in
a
certain
town
of
narbonnese
gaul
while
he
was
at
dinner
and
was
as
yet
unrecognized
of
any
some
corsairs
of
the
northmen
came
to
ply
their
piracies
in
the
very
port
when
their
vessels
were
descried
they
were
supposed
to
be
jewish
traders
according
to
some
african
according
to
others
and
british
in
the
opinion
of
others
but
the
gifted
monarch
perceiving
by
the
build
and
lightness
of
the
craft
that
they
bare
not
merchandise
but
foes
said
to
his
own
folk
vessels
be
not
laden
with
merchandise
but
manned
with
cruel
foes
at
these
words
all
the
franks
in
rivalry
one
with
another
run
to
their
ships
but
uselessly
for
the
northmen
indeed
hearing
that
yonder
was
he
whom
it
was
still
their
wont
to
call
charles
the
feared
lest
all
their
fleet
should
be
taken
or
destroyed
in
the
port
and
they
avoided
by
a
flight
of
inconceivable
rapidity
not
only
the
glaives
but
even
the
eyes
of
those
who
were
pursuing
them
pious
charles
however
a
prey
to
fear
rose
up
from
table
stationed
himself
at
a
window
looking
eastward
and
there
remained
a
long
while
and
his
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
as
none
durst
question
him
this
warlike
prince
explained
to
the
grandees
who
were
about
his
person
the
cause
of
his
movement
and
of
his
tears
ye
my
lieges
wherefore
i
weep
so
bitterly
of
a
surety
i
fear
not
lest
these
fellows
should
succeed
in
injuring
me
by
their
miserable
piracies
but
it
grieveth
me
deeply
that
while
i
live
they
should
have
been
nigh
to
touching
at
this
shore
and
i
am
a
prey
to
violent
sorrow
when
i
foresee
what
evils
they
will
heap
upon
my
descendants
and
their
people
footnote
after
his
grandfather
charles
martel
the
forecast
and
the
dejection
of
charles
were
not
unreasonable
it
will
be
found
that
there
is
special
mention
made
in
the
chronicles
of
the
ninth
and
tenth
centuries
of
incursions
into
france
of
norwegian
danish
swedish
and
irish
pirates
all
comprised
under
the
name
of
northmen
and
doubtless
many
other
incursions
of
less
gravity
have
left
no
trace
in
history
the
northmen
says
fauriel
descended
from
the
north
to
the
south
by
a
sort
of
natural
gradation
or
ladder
the
scheldt
was
the
first
river
by
the
mouth
of
which
they
penetrated
inland
the
seine
was
the
second
the
loire
the
third
the
advance
was
threatening
for
the
countries
traversed
by
the
garonne
and
it
was
in
that
vessels
freighted
with
northmen
for
the
first
time
ascended
this
last
river
to
a
considerable
distance
inland
and
there
took
immense
booty
the
following
year
they
pillaged
and
burnt
saintes
in
they
got
as
far
as
limoges
the
inhabitants
finding
themselves
unable
to
make
head
against
the
dauntless
pirates
abandoned
their
hearths
together
with
all
they
had
not
time
to
carry
away
encouraged
by
these
successes
the
northmen
reappeared
next
year
upon
the
coasts
and
in
the
rivers
of
aquitaine
and
they
attempted
to
take
bordeaux
whence
they
were
valorously
repulsed
by
the
inhabitants
but
in
having
once
more
laid
siege
to
that
city
they
were
admitted
into
it
at
night
by
the
jews
who
were
there
in
great
force
the
city
was
given
up
to
plunder
and
conflagration
a
portion
of
the
people
was
scattered
abroad
and
the
rest
put
to
the
sword
the
monasteries
and
churches
wherein
they
hoped
to
find
treasures
were
the
favorite
object
of
the
northmen
enterprises
in
particular
they
plundered
at
the
gates
of
paris
the
abbey
of
germain
des
prés
and
that
of
denis
whence
they
carried
off
the
abbot
who
could
not
purchase
his
freedom
save
by
a
heavy
ransom
they
penetrated
more
than
once
into
paris
itself
and
subjected
many
of
its
quarters
to
contributions
or
pillage
the
populations
grew
into
the
habit
of
suffering
and
fleeing
and
the
local
lords
and
even
the
kings
made
arrangement
sometimes
with
the
pirates
either
for
saving
the
royal
domains
from
the
ravages
or
for
having
their
own
share
therein
in
pépin
king
of
aquitaine
and
brother
of
charles
the
bald
came
to
an
understanding
with
the
northmen
who
had
ascended
the
garonne
and
were
threatening
toulouse
they
arrived
under
his
guidance
says
fauriel
they
laid
siege
to
it
took
it
and
plundered
it
not
halfwise
not
hastily
as
folks
who
feared
to
be
surprised
but
leisurely
with
all
security
by
virtue
of
a
treaty
of
alliance
with
one
of
the
kings
of
the
country
throughout
aquitaine
there
was
but
one
cry
of
indignation
against
pépin
and
the
popularity
of
charles
was
increased
in
proportion
to
all
the
horror
inspired
by
the
ineffable
misdeed
of
his
adversary
charles
the
bald
himself
if
he
did
not
ally
himself
as
pépin
did
with
the
invaders
took
scarce
any
interest
in
the
fate
of
the
populations
and
scarcely
more
trouble
to
protect
them
for
hincmar
archbishop
of
rheims
wrote
to
him
in
folks
say
that
you
are
incessantly
repeating
that
it
is
not
for
you
to
mix
yourself
up
with
these
depredations
and
robberies
and
that
everyone
has
but
to
defend
himself
as
best
he
may
in
the
middle
and
during
the
last
half
of
the
ninth
century
a
chief
of
the
northmen
named
hastenc
or
hastings
appeared
several
times
over
on
the
coasts
and
in
the
rivers
of
france
with
numerous
vessels
and
a
following
he
had
also
with
him
say
the
chronicles
a
young
norwegian
or
danish
prince
bioern
called
ironsides
whom
he
had
educated
and
who
had
preferred
sharing
the
fortunes
of
his
governor
to
living
quietly
with
the
king
his
father
after
several
expeditions
into
western
france
hastings
became
the
theme
of
terrible
and
very
probably
fabulous
stories
he
extended
his
cruises
they
say
to
the
mediterranean
and
having
arrived
at
the
coasts
of
tuscany
within
sight
of
a
city
which
in
his
ignorance
he
took
for
rome
he
resolved
to
pillage
it
but
not
feeling
strong
enough
to
attack
it
by
assault
he
sent
to
the
bishop
to
say
he
was
very
ill
felt
a
wish
to
become
a
christian
and
begged
to
be
baptized
some
days
afterward
his
comrades
spread
a
report
that
he
was
dead
and
claimed
for
him
the
honors
of
a
solemn
burial
the
bishop
consented
the
coffin
of
hastings
was
carried
into
the
church
attended
by
a
large
number
of
his
followers
without
visible
weapons
but
in
the
middle
of
the
ceremony
hastings
suddenly
leaped
up
sword
in
hand
from
his
coffin
his
followers
displayed
the
weapons
they
had
concealed
closed
the
doors
slew
the
priests
pillaged
the
ecclesiastical
treasures
and
reëmbarked
before
the
very
eyes
of
the
stupefied
population
to
go
and
resume
on
the
coasts
of
france
their
incursions
and
their
ravages
whether
they
were
true
or
false
these
rumors
of
bold
artifices
and
distant
expeditions
on
the
part
of
hastings
aggravated
the
dismay
inspired
by
his
appearance
he
penetrated
into
the
interior
of
the
country
took
possession
of
chartres
and
appeared
before
paris
where
charles
the
bald
intrenched
at
denis
was
deliberating
with
his
prelates
and
barons
as
to
how
he
might
resist
the
northmen
or
treat
with
them
the
chronicle
says
that
the
barons
advised
resistance
but
that
the
king
preferred
negotiation
and
sent
the
abbot
of
denis
the
which
was
an
exceeding
wise
man
to
hastings
who
after
long
parley
and
by
reason
of
large
gifts
and
promises
consented
to
stop
his
cruisings
to
become
a
christian
and
to
settle
in
the
countship
of
chartres
which
the
king
gave
him
as
an
hereditary
possession
with
all
its
appurtenances
according
to
other
accounts
it
was
only
some
years
later
under
the
young
king
louis
iii
grandson
of
charles
the
bald
that
hastings
was
induced
either
by
reverses
or
by
payment
of
money
to
cease
from
his
piracies
and
accept
in
recompense
the
countship
of
chartres
whatever
may
have
been
the
date
he
was
it
is
believed
the
first
chieftain
of
the
northmen
who
renounced
a
life
of
adventure
and
plunder
to
become
in
france
a
great
landed
proprietor
and
a
count
of
the
king
a
greater
chieftain
of
the
northmen
than
hastings
was
soon
to
follow
his
example
and
found
normandy
in
france
but
before
rolf
that
is
rollo
came
and
gave
the
name
of
his
race
to
a
french
province
the
piratical
northmen
were
again
to
attempt
a
greater
blow
against
france
and
to
suffer
a
great
reverse
in
november
under
the
reign
of
charles
the
fat
after
having
for
more
than
forty
years
irregularly
ravaged
france
they
resolved
to
unite
their
forces
in
order
at
length
to
obtain
possession
of
paris
whose
outskirts
they
had
so
often
pillaged
without
having
been
able
to
enter
the
heart
of
the
place
two
bodies
of
troops
were
set
in
motion
one
under
the
command
of
rollo
who
was
already
famous
among
his
comrades
marched
on
rouen
the
other
went
right
up
the
course
of
the
seine
under
the
orders
of
siegfried
whom
the
northmen
called
their
king
rollo
took
rouen
and
pushed
on
at
once
for
paris
duke
renaud
general
of
the
troops
went
to
encounter
him
on
the
banks
of
the
eure
and
sent
to
him
to
sound
his
intentions
hastings
the
newly
made
count
of
chartres
valiant
warriors
said
hastings
to
rollo
whence
come
ye
what
seek
ye
here
what
is
the
name
of
your
lord
and
master
tell
us
this
for
we
be
sent
unto
you
by
the
king
of
the
franks
we
be
danes
answered
rollo
and
all
be
equally
masters
among
us
we
be
come
to
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
this
land
and
to
subject
it
as
our
own
country
but
who
art
thou
thou
who
speakest
so
glibly
ye
have
sometime
heard
tell
of
one
hastings
who
issuing
forth
from
among
you
came
hither
with
much
shipping
and
made
desert
a
great
part
of
the
kingdom
of
the
franks
yes
said
rollo
we
have
heard
tell
of
him
hastings
began
well
and
ended
will
ye
yield
you
to
king
charles
asked
hastings
we
yield
was
the
answer
to
none
all
that
we
shall
take
by
our
arms
we
will
keep
as
our
right
go
and
tell
this
if
thou
wilt
to
the
king
whose
envoy
thou
boastest
to
be
hastings
returned
to
the
army
and
rollo
prepared
to
march
on
paris
hastings
had
gone
back
somewhat
troubled
in
mind
now
there
was
among
the
franks
one
count
tetbold
thibault
who
greatly
coveted
the
countship
of
chartres
and
he
said
to
hastings
why
slumberest
thou
softly
knowest
thou
not
that
king
charles
doth
purpose
thy
death
by
cause
of
all
the
christian
blood
that
thou
didst
aforetime
unjustly
shed
bethink
thee
of
all
the
evil
thou
hast
done
him
by
reason
whereof
he
purposeth
to
drive
thee
from
his
land
take
heed
to
thyself
that
thou
be
not
smitten
unawares
hastings
dismayed
at
once
sold
to
tetbold
the
town
of
chartres
and
removing
all
that
belonged
to
him
departed
to
go
and
resume
for
all
that
appears
his
old
course
of
life
on
the
of
november
all
the
forces
of
the
northmen
formed
a
junction
before
paris
seven
hundred
huge
barks
covered
two
leagues
of
the
seine
bringing
it
is
said
more
than
thirty
thousand
men
the
chieftains
were
astonished
at
sight
of
the
new
fortifications
of
the
city
a
double
wall
of
circumvallation
the
bridges
crowned
with
towers
and
in
the
environs
the
ramparts
of
the
abbeys
of
denis
and
germain
solidly
rebuilt
siegfried
hesitated
to
attack
a
town
so
well
defended
he
demanded
to
enter
alone
and
have
an
interview
with
the
bishop
gozlin
take
pity
on
thyself
and
thy
flock
said
he
to
him
let
us
pass
through
the
city
we
will
in
no
wise
touch
the
town
we
will
do
our
best
to
preserve
for
thee
and
count
eudes
all
your
possessions
this
city
replied
the
bishop
hath
been
confided
unto
us
by
the
emperor
charles
king
and
ruler
under
god
of
the
powers
of
the
earth
he
hath
confided
it
unto
us
not
that
it
should
cause
the
ruin
but
the
salvation
of
the
kingdom
if
peradventure
these
walls
had
been
confided
to
thy
keeping
as
they
have
been
to
mine
wouldst
thou
do
as
thou
biddest
me
if
ever
i
do
so
answered
siegfried
may
my
head
be
condemned
to
fall
by
the
sword
and
serve
as
food
to
the
dogs
but
if
thou
yield
not
to
our
prayers
so
soon
as
the
sun
shall
commence
his
course
our
armies
will
launch
upon
thee
their
poisoned
arrows
and
when
the
sun
shall
end
his
course
they
will
give
thee
over
to
all
the
horrors
of
famine
and
this
will
they
do
from
year
to
year
the
bishop
however
persisted
without
further
discussion
being
as
certain
of
count
eudes
as
he
was
of
himself
eudes
who
was
young
and
but
recently
made
count
of
paris
was
the
eldest
son
of
robert
the
strong
count
of
anjou
of
the
same
line
as
charlemagne
and
but
lately
slain
in
battle
against
the
northmen
paris
had
for
defenders
two
heroes
one
of
the
church
and
the
other
of
the
empire
the
faith
of
the
christian
and
the
fealty
of
the
vassal
the
conscientiousness
of
the
priest
and
the
honor
of
the
warrior
the
siege
lasted
thirteen
months
whiles
pushed
vigorously
forward
with
eight
several
assaults
whiles
maintained
by
close
investment
and
with
all
the
alternations
of
success
and
reverse
all
the
intermixture
of
brilliant
daring
and
obscure
sufferings
that
can
occur
when
the
assailants
are
determined
and
the
defenders
devoted
not
only
a
contemporary
but
an
abbo
a
monk
of
germain
des
près
has
recounted
the
details
in
a
long
poem
wherein
the
writer
devoid
of
talent
adds
nothing
to
the
simple
representation
of
events
it
is
history
itself
which
gives
to
abbo
poem
a
high
degree
of
interest
we
do
not
possess
in
reference
to
these
continual
struggles
of
the
northmen
with
the
populations
any
other
document
which
is
equally
precise
and
complete
or
which
could
make
us
so
well
acquainted
with
all
the
incidents
all
the
phases
of
this
irregular
warfare
between
two
peoples
one
without
a
government
the
other
without
a
country
the
bishop
gozlin
died
during
the
siege
count
eudes
quitted
paris
for
a
time
to
go
and
beg
aid
of
the
emperor
but
the
parisians
soon
saw
him
reappear
on
the
heights
of
montmartre
with
three
battalions
of
troops
and
he
reëntered
the
town
spurring
on
his
horse
and
striking
right
and
left
with
his
through
the
ranks
of
the
dumfounded
besiegers
the
struggle
was
prolonged
throughout
the
summer
and
when
in
november
charles
the
fat
at
last
appeared
before
paris
with
a
large
army
of
all
nations
it
was
to
purchase
the
retreat
of
the
northmen
at
the
cost
of
a
heavy
ransom
and
by
allowing
them
to
go
and
winter
in
burgundy

the
inhabitants
obeyed

months

proclaimed
emperor
in
his
stead
at
the

and
crowned
by
the
archbishop
of

duke
of
spoleto
descended
from
charlemagne
in
the
female
line
hastened
to
france
and
was
declared
king
at
langres
by
the
bishop
of
that
town
but
returned
with
precipitation
to
italy
seeing
no
chance
of
maintaining
himself
in
his
french
kingship
elsewhere
boso
duke
of
arles
became
king
of
provence
and
the
burgundian
count
rudolph
had
himself
crowned
at
maurice
in
the
valais
king
of

there
was

carlovingian
a
son
of
louis
the
stutterer
who
was
hereafter
to
become
charles
the
simple
but
being
only
a
child
he
had
been
rejected
or
completely
forgotten
and
in
the
interval
that
was
to
elapse
ere
his
time
should
arrive
kings
were
being
made
in
all
directions
in
the
midst
of
this
confusion
the
northmen
though
they
kept
at
a
distance
from
paris
pursued
in
western
france
their
cruising
and
plundering
in
rollo
they
had
a
chieftain
far
superior
to
his
vagabond
predecessors
though
he
still
led
the
same
life
that
they
had
he
displayed
therein
other
faculties
other
inclinations
other
views
in
his
youth
he
had
made
an
expedition
to
england
and
had
there
contracted
a
real
friendship
with
the
wise
king
alfred
the
great
during
a
campaign
in
friesland
he
had
taken
prisoner
rainier
count
of
hainault
and
alberade
countess
of
brabant
made
a
request
to
rollo
for
her
release
offering
in
return
to
set
free
twelve
captains
of
the
northmen
her
prisoners
and
to
give
up
all
the
gold
she
possessed
rollo
took
only
half
the
gold
and
restored
to
the
countess
her
husband
when
in
he
became
master
of
rouen
instead
of
devastating
the
city
after
the
fashion
of
his
kind
he
respected
the
buildings
had
the
walls
repaired
and
humored
the
inhabitants
in
spite
of
his
violent
and
extortionate
practices
where
he
met
with
obstinate
resistance
there
were
to
be
discerned
in
him
symptoms
of
more
noble
sentiments
and
of
an
instinctive
leaning
toward
order
civilization
and
government
after
the
deposition
of
charles
the
fat
and
during
the
reign
of
eudes
a
lively
struggle
was
maintained
between
the
frankish
king
and
the
chieftain
of
the
northmen
who
had
neither
of
them
forgotten
their
early
encounters
they
strove
one
against
the
other
with
varied
fortunes
eudes
succeeded
in
beating
the
northmen
at
montfaucon
but
was
beaten
in
vermandois
by
another
band
commanded
it
is
said
by
the
veteran
hastings
sometime
count
of
chartres
rollo
too
had
his
share
at
one
time
of
success
at
another
of
reverse
but
he
made
himself
master
of
several
important
towns
showed
a
disposition
to
treat
the
quiet
populations
gently
and
made
a
fresh
trip
to
england
during
which
he
renewed
friendly
relations
with
her
king
athelstan
the
successor
of
alfred
the
great
he
thus
became
from
day
to
day
more
reputable
as
well
as
more
formidable
in
france
insomuch
that
eudes
himself
was
obliged
to
have
recourse
in
dealing
with
him
to
negotiations
and
presents
when
in
eudes
was
dead
and
charles
the
simple
at
hardly
nineteen
years
of
age
had
been
recognized
sole
king
of
france
the
ascendency
of
rollo
became
such
that
the
necessity
of
treating
with
him
was
clear
in
charles
by
the
advice
of
his
councillors
and
among
them
of
robert
brother
of
the
late
king
eudes
who
had
himself
become
count
of
paris
and
duke
of
france
sent
to
the
chieftain
of
the
northmen
franco
archbishop
of
rouen
with
orders
to
offer
him
the
cession
of
a
considerable
portion
of
neustria
and
the
hand
of
his
young
daughter
gisèle
on
condition
that
he
became
a
christian
and
acknowledged
himself
the
king
vassal
rollo
by
the
advice
of
his
comrades
received
these
overtures
with
a
good
grace
and
agreed
to
a
truce
for
three
months
during
which
they
might
treat
about
peace
on
the
day
fixed
charles
accompanied
by
duke
robert
and
rollo
surrounded
by
his
warriors
repaired
to
on
the
opposite
banks
of
the
river
and
exchanged
numerous
messages
charles
offered
rollo
flanders
which
the
northman
refused
considering
it
too
swampy
as
to
the
maritime
portion
of
neustria
he
would
not
be
contented
with
it
it
was
he
said
covered
with
forests
and
had
become
quite
a
stranger
to
the
ploughshare
by
reason
of
the
northmen
incessant
incursions
he
demanded
the
addition
of
territories
taken
from
brittany
and
that
the
princes
of
that
province
bérenger
and
alan
lords
respectively
of
redon
and
dol
should
take
the
oath
of
fidelity
to
him
when
matters
had
been
arranged
on
this
basis
the
bishops
told
rollo
that
he
who
received
such
a
gift
as
the
duchy
of
normandy
was
bound
to
kiss
the
king
foot
quoth
rollo
i
bend
the
knee
before
the
knees
of
any
and
i
will
kiss
the
foot
of
none
at
the
solicitation
of
the
franks
he
then
ordered
one
of
his
warriors
to
kiss
the
king
foot
the
northman
remaining
bolt
upright
took
hold
of
the
king
foot
raised
it
to
his
mouth
and
so
made
the
king
fall
backward
which
caused
great
bursts
of
laughter
and
much
disturbance
among
the
throng
then
the
king
and
all
the
grandees
who
were
about
him
prelates
abbots
dukes
and
counts
swore
in
the
name
of
the
catholic
faith
that
they
would
protect
the
patrician
rollo
in
his
life
his
members
and
his
folk
and
would
guarantee
to
him
the
possession
of
the
aforesaid
land
to
him
and
his
descendants
forever
after
which
the
king
well
satisfied
returned
to
his
domains
and
rollo
departed
with
duke
robert
for
the
town
of
rouen
the
dignity
of
charles
the
simple
had
no
reason
to
be
well
satisfied
but
the
great
political
question
which
a
century
before
caused
charlemagne
such
lively
anxiety
was
solved
the
most
dangerous
the
most
incessantly
renewed
of
all
foreign
invasions
those

the

had
been
made

and
succeeded
his
father
egbert
as
king
of
anglia
in

early
occupied

alfred
lived
at
the
court
of
ethelbert
and
became
noted
for
the
intelligence
and
studious
activities
which
were
to
make
his
future
reign
the
conspicuous
epoch
in
english
history
so
brilliantly
commemorated
a
thousand
years
after
his
death
in
in
the
millenary
celebrated
in
winchester
and
its
neighborhood
in
ethelbert
died
in
and
was
succeeded
by
ethelred
in
alfred
married
elswitha
the
daughter
of
ethelred
mucil
of
mercia
meanwhile
the
danes
had
resumed
their
predatory
excursions
and
in
the
winter
of
ethelred
accompanied
by
alfred
attacked
them
at
reading
but
after
an
initial
victory
was
repulsed
four
days
later
ethelred
and
alfred
with
their
forces
were
attacked
on
ashdown
near
white
horse
hill
after
a
heavy
slaughter
the
danes
were
out
to
flight
the
danes
however
reinforced
by
guthrum
with
new
troops
from
over
the
sea
within
a
fortnight
resumed
offensive
operations
and
at
merton
two
months
later
ethelred
was
mortally
wounded
he
died
almost
immediately
after
the
battle
and
at
the
age
of
alfred
ascended
the
throne
of
his
fathers
which
was
tottering
as
it
seemed
to
its
fall
thomas
hughes
the
throne
of
the
west
saxons
was
not
an
inheritance
to
be
desired
in
the
year
when
alfred
succeeded
his
gallant
brother
it
descended
on
him
without
comment
or
ceremony
as
a
matter
of
course
there
was
not
even
an
assembly
of
the
witan
to
declare
the
succession
as
in
ordinary
times
with
guthrum
and
hinguar
in
their
intrenched
camp
at
the
confluence
of
the
thames
and
kennet
and
fresh
bands
of
marauders
sailing
up
the
former
river
and
constantly
swelling
the
ranks
of
the
pagan
army
during
these
summer
months
there
was
neither
time
nor
heart
among
the
wise
men
of
the
west
saxons
for
strict
adherence
to
the
letter
of
the
constitution
however
venerable
the
succession
had
already
been
settled
by
the
great
council
when
they
formally
accepted
the
provisions
of
ethelwulf
will
that
his
three
sons
should
succeed
to
the
exclusion
of
the
children
of
any
one
of
them
the
idea
of
strict
hereditary
succession
has
taken
so
strong
a
hold
of
us
english
in
later
times
that
it
is
necessary
constantly
to
insist
that
our
old
english
kingship
was
elective
alfred
title
was
based
on
election
and
so
little
was
the
idea
of
usurpation
or
of
any
wrong
done
to
the
two
infant
sons
of
ethelred
connected
with
his
accession
that
even
the
lineal
descendant
of
one
of
those
sons
in
his
chronicle
of
that
eventful
year
does
not
pause
to
notice
the
fact
that
ethelred
left
children
he
is
writing
to
his
beloved
cousin
matilda
to
instruct
her
in
the
things
which
he
had
received
from
ancient
traditions
of
the
history
of
our
race
down
to
these
two
kings
from
whom
we
have
our
origin
the
fourth
son
of
ethelwulf
he
writes
was
ethelred
who
after
the
death
of
ethelbert
succeeded
to
the
kingdom
and
was
also
my
grandfather
grandfather
the
fifth
was
alfred
who
succeeded
after
all
the
others
to
the
whole
sovereignty
and
was
your
grandfather
and
so
passes
on
to
the
next
facts
without
a
word
as
to
the
claims
of
his
own
lineal
ancestor
though
he
had
paused
in
his
narrative
at
this
point
for
the
special
purpose
of
introducing
a
little
family
episode
when
alfred
had
buried
his
brother
in
the
cloisters
of
wimborne
minster
and
had
time
to
look
out
from
his
dorsetshire
and
take
stock
of
the
immediate
prospects
and
work
which
lay
before
him
we
can
well
believe
that
those
historians
are
right
who
have
told
us
that
for
the
moment
he
lost
heart
and
hope
and
suffered
himself
to
doubt
whether
god
would
by
his
hand
deliver
the
afflicted
nation
from
its
terrible
straits
in
the
eight
pitched
battles
which
we
find
by
the
asser
giving
seven
only
had
already
been
fought
with
the
pagan
army
the
flower
of
the
youth
of
these
parts
of
the
west
saxon
kingdom
must
have
fallen
the
other
teutonic
kingdoms
of
the
island
of
which
he
was
overlord
and
so
bound
to
defend
had
ceased
to
exist
except
in
name
or
lay
utterly
powerless
like
mercia
awaiting
their
doom
kent
sussex
and
surrey
which
were
now
an
integral
part
of
the
royal
inheritance
of
his
own
family
were
at
the
mercy
of
his
enemies
and
he
without
a
hope
of
striking
a
blow
for
them
london
had
been
pillaged
and
was
in
ruins
even
in
wessex
proper
berkshire
and
hampshire
with
parts
of
wilts
and
dorset
had
been
crossed
and
recrossed
by
marauding
bands
in
whose
track
only
smoking
ruins
and
dead
bodies
were
found
the
land
was
as
the
garden
of
eden
before
them
and
behind
them
a
desolate
wilderness
these
bands
were
at
this
very
moment
on
foot
striking
into
new
districts
farther
to
the
southwest
than
they
had
yet
reached
if
the
rich
lands
of
somersetshire
and
devonshire
and
the
yet
unplundered
parts
of
wilts
and
dorset
are
to
be
saved
it
must
be
by
prompt
and
decisive
fighting
and
it
is
time
for
a
king
to
be
in
the
field
but
it
is
a
month
from
his
brother
death
before
alfred
can
gather
men
enough
round
his
standard
to
take
the
field
openly
even
then
when
he
fights
it
is
almost
against
his
will
for
his
ranks
are
sadly
thin
and
the
whole
pagan
army
are
before
him
at
wilton
near
salisbury
the
action
would
seem
to
have
been
brought
on
by
the
impetuosity
of
alfred
own
men
whose
spirit
was
still
unbroken
and
their
confidence
in
their
young
king
enthusiastic
there
was
a
long
and
fierce
fight
as
usual
during
the
earlier
part
of
which
the
saxons
had
the
advantage
though
greatly
outnumbered
but
again
we
get
glimpses
of
the
old
trap
of
a
feigned
flight
and
ambuscade
into
which
they
fell
and
so
again
lose
possession
of
the
place
of
death
the
ultimate
test
of
victory
this
year
says
the
nine
general
battles
were
fought
against
the
army
in
the
kingdom
south
of
the
thames
besides
which
alfred
the
brother
and
single
aldermen
and
king
thanes
oftentimes
made
attacks
on
them
which
were
not
counted
and
within
the
year
one
king
and
nine
jarls
earls
were
slain
wilton
was
the
last
of
these
general
actions
and
not
long
afterward
probably
in
the
autumn
alfred
made
peace
with
the
pagans
on
condition
that
they
should
quit
wessex
at
once
they
were
probably
allowed
to
carry
off
whatever
spoils
they
may
have
been
able
to
accumulate
in
their
reading
camp
but
i
can
find
no
authority
for
believing
that
alfred
fell
into
the
fatal
and
humiliating
mistake
of
either
paying
them
anything
or
giving
hostages
or
promising
tribute
this
young
king
who
as
crown
prince
led
the
west
saxons
up
the
slopes
at
ashdown
when
bagsac
the
two
sidrocs
and
the
rest
were
killed
and
who
has
very
much
their
own
way
of
fighting
going
into
the
clash
of
arms
when
the
hard
steel
rings
upon
the
high
helmets
and
the
beasts
of
prey
have
ample
spoil
like
a
veritable
child
of
odin
is
clearly
one
whom
it
is
best
to
let
alone
at
any
rate
so
long
as
easy
plunder
and
rich
lands
are
to
be
found
elsewhere
without
such
fighting
for
every
herd
of
cattle
and
rood
of
ground
indeed
i
think
the
careful
reader
may
trace
from
the
date
of
ashdown
a
decided
unwillingness
on
the
part
of
the
danes
to
meet
alfred
except
when
they
could
catch
him
at
disastrous
odds
they
succeeded
indeed
for
a
time
in
overrunning
almost
the
whole
of
his
kingdom
in
driving
him
an
exile
for
a
few
wretched
weeks
to
the
shelter
of
his
own
forests
but
whenever
he
was
once
fairly
in
the
field
they
preferred
taking
refuge
in
strong
places
and
offering
treaties
and
hostages
to
the
actual
arbitrament
of
battle
so
the
pagan
army
quitted
reading
and
wintered
in
in
the
neighborhood
of
london
at
which
place
they
received
proposals
from
buhred
king
of
the
mercians
alfred
and
for
a
money
payment
pass
him
and
his
people
contemptuously
by
for
the
time
making
some
kind
of
treaty
of
peace
with
them
and
go
northward
into
what
has
now
become
their
own
country
they
winter
in
lincolnshire
gathering
fresh
strength
during
from
the
sources
of
supply
across
the
narrow
seas
again
however
in
this
year
of
ominous
rest
they
renew
their
sham
peace
with
poor
buhred
and
his
mercians
who
thus
manage
to
tide
it
over
another
winter
in
however
their
time
has
come
in
the
spring
the
pagan
army
under
the
three
kings
guthrum
oskytal
and
amund
burst
into
mercia
in
this
one
only
of
the
english
teutonic
kingdoms
they
find
neither
fighting
nor
suffering
hero
to
cross
their
way
and
leave
behind
for
a
thousand
years
the
memory
of
a
noble
end
cut
out
there
in
some
lines
of
an
old
chronicler
but
full
of
life
and
inspiration
to
this
day
for
all
englishmen
the
whole
country
is
overrun
and
reduced
under
pagan
rule
without
a
blow
struck
so
far
as
we
know
and
within
the
year
poor
buhred
titular
king
of
the
mercians
who
has
made
believe
to
rule
this
english
kingdom
these
years
who
in
his
time
has
marched
with
his
ethelwulf
across
north
wales
has
beleaguered
nottingham
with
his
ethelred
and
alfred
six
years
back
not
without
show
of
manhood
sees
for
his
part
nothing
for
it
under
such
circumstances
but
to
get
away
as
swiftly
as
possible
as
many
kings
have
done
before
him
and
since
the
west
saxon
court
is
no
place
for
him
quite
other
views
of
kingship
prevailing
in
those
parts
so
the
poor
buhred
breaks
away
from
his
anchors
leaving
his
wife
ethelswitha
even
in
his
haste
to
take
refuge
with
her
brother
or
is
it
that
the
heart
of
the
daughter
of
the
race
of
cerdic
swells
against
leaving
the
land
which
her
sires
had
won
the
people
they
had
planted
there
in
the
moment
of
sorest
need
in
any
case
buhred
drifts
away
alone
across
into
france
and
so
toward
the
winter
to
rome
there
he
dies
at
once
about
of
shame
and
sorrow
probably
or
of
a
broken
heart
as
we
say
at
any
rate
having
this
kingly
gift
left
in
him
that
he
can
not
live
and
look
on
the
ruin
of
his
people
as
edmund
brother
edwold
is
doing
in
these
same
years
near
a
clear
well
at
carnelia
in
dorsetshire
doing
the
hermit
business
there
on
bread
and
water
the
english
in
rome
bury
away
poor
buhred
with
all
the
honors
in
the
church
of
mary
to
which
the
english
schools
rebuilt
by
his
ethelwulf
were
attached
ethelswitha
visited
or
started
to
visit
the
tomb
years
later
we
are
told
in
when
mercia
had
risen
to
new
life
under
her
great
brother
rule
through
these
same
months
guthrum
oskytal
and
the
rest
are
wintering
at
repton
after
destroying
there
the
cloister
where
the
kingly
line
of
mercia
lie
disturbing
perhaps
the
bones
of
the
great
offa
whom
charlemagne
had
to
treat
as
an
equal
neither
of
the
pagan
kings
is
inclined
at
this
time
to
settle
in
mercia
so
casting
about
what
to
do
with
it
they
light
on
a
certain
foolish
man
a
king
thane
one
ceolwulf
and
set
him
up
as
a
sort
of
king
popinjay
from
this
ceolwulf
they
take
hostages
for
the
payment
of
yearly
tribute
to
be
wrung
out
of
these
poor
mercians
on
pain
of
dethronement
and
for
the
surrender
of
the
kingdom
to
them
on
whatever
day
they
would
have
it
back
again
foolish
king
thanes
turned
into
king
popinjays
by
pagans
and
left
to
play
at
government
on
such
terms
are
not
pleasant
or
profitable
objects
in
such
times
as
these
of
one
thousand
years
since
or
indeed
in
any
times
for
the
matter
of
that
so
let
us
finish
with
ceolwulf
just
noting
that
a
year
or
two
later
his
pagan
lords
seem
to
have
found
much
of
the
spoil
of
monasteries
and
the
pickings
of
earl
and
churl
of
folkland
and
bookland
sticking
to
his
fingers
instead
of
finding
its
way
to
their
coffers
this
was
far
from
their
meaning
in
setting
him
up
in
the
high
places
of
mercia
so
they
strip
him
and
thrust
him
out
and
he
dies
in
beggary
this
then
is
the
winter
work
of
the
great
pagan
army
at
repton
alfred
watching
them
and
their
work
doubtless
with
keen
eye
not
without
misgivings
too
at
their
numbers
swollen
again
to
terrible
proportions
since
they
sailed
away
down
thames
after
wilton
fight
it
will
take
years
yet
before
the
gaps
in
the
fighting
strength
of
wessex
left
by
those
nine
pitched
battles
and
other
smaller
fights
will
be
filled
by
the
crop
of
youths
passing
from
childhood
to
manhood
an
anxious
thought
that
for
a
young
king
the
pagans
however
are
not
yet
ready
for
another
throw
for
wessex
and
so
when
mercia
is
sucked
dry
for
the
present
and
will
no
longer
suitably
maintain
so
great
a
host
they
again
sever
halfdene
who
would
seem
to
have
joined
them
recently
takes
a
large
part
of
the
army
away
with
him
northward
settling
his
by
the
river
tyne
he
subdues
all
the
land
and
ofttimes
spoils
the
picts
and
the
strathclyde
britons
among
other
holy
places
in
those
parts
halfdene
visits
the
isle
of
lindisfarne
hoping
perhaps
in
his
pagan
soul
not
only
to
commit
ordinary
sacrilege
in
the
holy
places
there
which
is
work
for
the
like
of
him
but
even
to
lay
impious
hands
on
and
to
treat
with
indignity
the
remains
of
that
holy
man
cuthbert
who
has
become
in
due
course
patron
and
guardian
saint
of
hunters
and
of
that
scourge
of
pagans
alfred
the
west
saxon
if
such
were
his
thoughts
he
is
disappointed
of
his
sacrilege
for
bishop
eardulf
and
abbot
eadred
devout
and
strenuous
persons
having
timely
warning
of
his
approach
carry
away
the
sainted
body
from
lindisfarne
and
for
nine
years
hide
with
it
up
and
down
the
distracted
northern
counties
now
here
now
there
moving
that
sacred
treasure
from
place
to
place
until
this
bitterness
is
overpast

stands
very
high
will
surely
warmly
befriend
them
hereafter
when

has
settled
his
accounts
with
many
persons
and

from
the
time
of
this

of

under
guthrum
oskytal
and
amund
on
leaving
repton
strike
southeast
through
what
was
landlord
edmund
country
to
cambridge
where
in
their
usual
heathen
way
they
pass
the
winter
of
the
downfall
exile
and
death
of
his
in
must
have
warned
alfred
if
he
had
any
need
of
warning
that
no
treaty
could
bind
these
foemen
and
that
he
had
nothing
to
look
for
but
the
same
measure
as
soon
as
the
pagan
leaders
felt
themselves
strong
enough
to
mete
it
out
to
him
and
wessex
in
the
following
year
we
accordingly
find
him
on
the
alert
and
taking
action
in
a
new
direction
these
heathen
pirates
he
sees
fight
his
people
at
terrible
advantage
by
reason
of
their
command
of
the
sea
this
enables
them
to
choose
their
own
point
of
attack
not
only
along
the
but
up
every
river
as
far
as
their
light
galleys
can
swim
to
retreat
unmolested
at
their
own
time
whenever
the
fortune
of
war
turns
against
them
to
bring
reinforcements
of
men
and
supplies
to
the
scene
of
action
without
fear
of
hindrance
his
saxons
have
long
since
given
up
their
seafaring
habits
they
have
become
before
all
things
an
agricultural
people
drawing
almost
everything
they
need
from
their
own
soil
the
few
foreign
tastes
they
have
are
supplied
by
foreign
traders
however
if
wessex
is
to
be
made
safe
the
must
be
met
on
their
own
element
and
so
with
what
expenditure
of
patience
and
money
and
encouraging
words
and
example
we
may
easily
conjecture
the
young
king
gets
together
a
small
fleet
and
himself
takes
command
of
it
we
have
no
clew
to
the
point
on
the
south
coast
where
the
admiral
of
twenty
five
fights
his
first
naval
action
but
know
only
that
in
the
summer
of
he
is
cruising
with
his
fleet
and
meets
seven
tall
ships
of
the
enemy
one
of
these
he
captures
and
the
rest
make
off
after
a
hard
fight
no
small
encouragement
to
the
sailor
king
who
has
thus
for
another
year
saved
saxon
homesteads
from
devastation
by
fire
and
sword
the
second
wave
of
invasion
had
now
at
last
gathered
weight
and
volume
enough
and
broke
on
the
king
and
people
of
the
west
saxons
the
year
was
still
young
when
the
whole
pagan
army
which
had
wintered
at
and
about
cambridge
marched
to
their
ships
and
put
to
sea
guthrum
was
in
command
with
the
other
two
kings
anketel
and
amund
as
his
lieutenants
under
whom
was
a
host
as
formidable
as
that
which
had
marched
across
mercia
through
forest
and
waste
and
sailed
up
the
thames
five
years
before
to
the
assault
of
reading
there
must
have
been
some
few
days
of
harassing
suspense
for
we
can
not
suppose
that
alfred
was
not
aware
of
the
movements
of
his
terrible
foes
probably
his
new
fleet
cruised
off
the
south
coast
on
the
watch
for
them
and
all
up
the
thames
there
were
gloomy
watchings
and
forebodings
of
a
repetition
of
the
evil
days
of
but
the
suspense
was
soon
over
passing
by
the
mouth
and
through
dover
straits
the
pagan
fleet
sailed
and
westward
still
past
many
tempting
harbors
and
rivers
mouths
until
they
came
off
the
coast
of
dorsetshire
there
they
land
at
wareham
and
seize
and
fortify
the
neck
of
land
between
the
rivers
frome
and
piddle
on
which
stood
when
they
landed
a
fortress
of
the
west
saxons
and
a
monastery
of
holy
virgins
fortress
and
monastery
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
danes
who
set
to
work
at
once
to
throw
up
earthworks
and
otherwise
fortify
a
space
large
enough
to
contain
their
army
and
all
spoil
brought
in
by
marauding
bands
from
this
hitherto
unplundered
country
this
fortified
camp
was
soon
very
strong
except
on
the
western
side
upon
which
alfred
shortly
appeared
with
a
body
of
horsemen
and
such
other
troops
as
could
be
gathered
hastily
together
the
detachment
of
the
pagans
who
were
already
out
pillaging
the
whole
neighborhood
fell
back
apparently
before
him
concentrating
on
the
wareham
camp
before
its
outworks
alfred
paused
he
is
too
experienced
a
soldier
now
to
risk
at
the
outset
of
a
campaign
such
a
disaster
as
that
which
he
and
ethelred
had
sustained
in
their
attempt
to
assault
the
camp
at
reading
in
he
is
just
strong
enough
to
keep
the
pagans
within
their
lines
but
has
no
margin
to
spare
so
he
sits
down
before
the
camp
but
no
battle
is
fought
neither
he
nor
guthrum
caring
to
bring
matters
to
that
issue
soon
negotiations
are
commenced
and
again
a
treaty
is
made
on
this
occasion
alfred
would
seem
to
have
taken
special
pains
to
bind
his
faithless
foe
all
the
holy
relics
which
could
be
procured
from
holy
places
in
the
neighborhood
were
brought
together
that
he
himself
and
his
people
might
set
the
example
of
pledging
themselves
in
the
most
solemn
manner
known
to
christian
men
then
a
holy
ring
or
bracelet
smeared
with
the
blood
of
beasts
sacrificed
to
woden
was
placed
on
a
heathen
altar
upon
this
guthrum
and
his
fellow
kings
and
earls
swore
on
behalf
of
the
army
that
they
would
quit
the
king
country
and
give
hostages
such
an
oath
had
never
been
sworn
by
danish
leader
on
english
soil
before
it
was
the
most
solemn
known
to
them
they
would
seem
also
to
have
sworn
on
alfred
relics
as
an
extra
proof
of
their
sincerity
for
this
once
and
their
hostages
from
among
the
most
renowned
men
in
the
army
were
duly
handed
over
alfred
now
relaxed
his
watch
even
if
he
did
not
withdraw
with
the
main
body
of
his
army
leaving
his
horse
to
see
that
the
terms
of
the
treaty
were
performed
and
to
watch
the
wareham
camp
until
the
departure
of
the
pagan
host
but
neither
oath
on
sacred
ring
nor
the
risk
to
their
hostages
weighed
with
guthrum
and
his
followers
when
any
advantage
was
to
be
gained
by
treachery
they
steal
out
of
the
camp
by
night
surprise
and
murder
the
saxon
horsemen
seize
the
horses
and
strike
across
the
country
the
mounted
men
leading
to
exeter
but
leaving
a
sufficient
garrison
to
hold
wareham
for
the
present
they
surprise
and
get
possession
of
the
western
capital
and
there
settle
down
to
pass
the
winter
rollo
fiercest
of
the
vikings
is
said
by
asser
to
have
passed
the
winter
with
them
in
their
exeter
quarters
on
his
way
to
normandy
but
whether
the
great
robber
himself
were
here
or
not
it
is
certain
that
the
channel
swarmed
with
pirate
fleets
who
could
put
in
to
wareham
or
exeter
at
their
discretion
and
find
a
safe
stronghold
in
either
place
from
which
to
carry
fire
and
sword
through
the
unhappy
country
alfred
had
vainly
endeavored
to
overtake
the
march
to
exeter
in
the
autumn
of
and
failing
in
the
pursuit
had
disbanded
his
own
troops
as
usual
allowing
them
to
go
to
their
own
homes
until
the
spring
before
he
could
be
afoot
again
in
the
spring
of
the
main
body
of
the
pagans
at
exeter
had
made
that
city
too
strong
for
any
attempt
at
assault
so
the
king
and
his
troops
could
do
no
more
than
beleaguer
it
on
the
land
side
as
he
had
done
at
wareham
but
guthrum
could
laugh
at
all
efforts
of
his
great
antagonist
and
wait
in
confidence
the
sure
disbanding
of
the
saxon
troops
at
harvest
time
so
long
as
his
ships
held
the
sea
supplies
were
running
short
in
exeter
but
the
exe
was
open
and
communications
going
on
with
wareham
it
is
arranged
that
the
camp
there
shall
be
broken
up
and
the
whole
garrison
with
their
spoil
shall
join
one
hundred
and
twenty
danish
are
freighted
and
beat
down
channel
but
are
baffled
by
adverse
winds
for
nearly
a
month
they
and
all
their
supplies
may
be
looked
for
any
day
in
the
exe
when
the
wind
changes
alfred
from
his
camp
before
exeter
sends
to
his
little
fleet
to
put
to
sea
he
can
not
himself
be
with
them
as
in
their
first
action
for
he
knows
well
that
guthrum
will
seize
the
first
moment
of
his
absence
to
sally
from
exeter
break
the
saxon
lines
and
scatter
his
army
in
roving
bands
over
devonshire
on
their
way
back
to
the
eastern
kingdom
the
saxon
fleet
puts
out
manned
itself
as
some
say
partly
with
hired
to
fight
their
own
people
however
manned
it
attacks
bravely
a
portion
of
the
pirates
but
a
mightier
power
than
the
fleet
fought
for
alfred
at
this
crisis
first
a
dense
fog
and
then
a
great
storm
came
on
bursting
on
the
south
coast
with
such
fury
that
the
pagans
lost
no
less
than
one
hundred
of
their
chief
ships
off
swanage
as
mighty
a
deliverance
perhaps
for
england
though
the
memory
of
it
is
nearly
forgotten
as
that
which
began
in
the
same
seas
seven
hundred
years
later
when
drake
and
the
of
the
sixteenth
century
were
hanging
on
the
rear
of
the
spanish
along
the
devon
and
dorset
coasts
while
the
beacons
blazed
up
all
over
england
and
the
whole
nation
flew
to
arms
the
destruction
of
the
fleet
decided
the
fate
of
the
siege
of
exeter
once
more
negotiations
are
opened
by
the
pagans
once
more
alfred
fearful
of
driving
them
to
extremities
listens
treats
and
finally
accepts
oaths
and
more
hostages
acknowledging
probably
in
sorrow
to
himself
that
he
can
for
the
moment
do
no
better
and
on
this
occasion
guthrum
being
caught
far
from
home
and
without
supplies
or
ships
keeps
the
peace
well
moving
as
we
conjecture
watched
jealously
by
alfred
on
the
shortest
line
across
devon
and
somerset
to
some
ford
in
the
avon
and
so
across
into
mercia
where
he
arrives
during
harvest
and
billets
his
army
on
ceolwulf
camping
them
for
the
winter
about
the
city
of
gloster
here
they
run
up
huts
for
themselves
and
make
some
pretense
of
permanent
settlement
on
the
severn
dividing
large
tracts
of
land
among
those
who
cared
to
take
them
the
campaigns
of
are
generally
looked
upon
as
disastrous
ones
for
the
saxon
arms
but
this
view
is
certainly
not
supported
by
the
chroniclers
it
is
true
that
both
at
wareham
and
exeter
the
pagans
broke
new
ground
and
secured
their
position
from
which
no
doubt
they
did
sore
damage
in
the
neighboring
districts
but
we
can
trace
in
these
years
none
of
the
old
ostentatious
daring
and
thirst
for
battle
with
alfred
whenever
he
appears
the
pirate
bands
draw
back
at
once
into
their
strongholds
and
exhausted
as
great
part
of
wessex
must
have
been
by
the
constant
strain
the
west
saxons
show
no
signs
yet
of
falling
from
their
gallant
king
if
he
can
no
longer
collect
in
a
week
such
an
army
as
fought
at
ashdown
he
can
still
without
much
delay
bring
to
his
side
a
sufficient
force
to
hem
the
pagans
in
and
keep
them
behind
their
ramparts
but
the
nature
of
the
service
was
telling
sadly
on
the
resources
of
the
kingdom
south
of
the
thames
to
the
saxons
there
came
no
new
levies
while
from
the
north
and
east
of
england
as
well
as
from
over
the
sea
guthrum
was
ever
drawing
to
his
standard
wandering
bands
of
sturdy
northmen
the
most
important
of
these
reinforcements
came
to
him
from
an
unexpected
quarter
this
autumn
we
have
not
heard
for
some
years
of
hubba
the
brother
of
hinguar
the
younger
of
the
two
vikings
who
planned
and
led
the
first
great
invasion
in
perhaps
he
may
have
resented
the
arrival
of
guthrum
and
other
kings
in
the
following
years
to
whom
he
had
to
give
place
whatever
may
have
been
the
cause
he
seems
to
have
gone
off
on
his
own
account
carrying
with
him
the
famous
raven
standard
to
do
his
appointed
work
in
these
years
on
other
coasts
under
its
ominous
shade
this
war
flag
which
they
call
raven
was
a
sacred
object
to
the
northmen
when
hinguar
and
hubba
had
heard
of
the
death
of
their
father
regnar
lodbrog
and
had
resolved
to
avenge
him
while
they
were
calling
together
their
followers
their
three
sisters
in
one
day
wove
for
them
this
in
the
midst
of
which
was
portrayed
the
figure
of
a
raven
whenever
the
flag
went
before
them
into
battle
if
they
were
to
win
the
day
the
sacred
raven
would
rouse
itself
and
stretch
its
wings
but
if
defeat
awaited
them
the
flag
would
hang
round
its
staff
and
the
bird
remain
motionless
this
wonder
had
been
proved
in
many
a
fight
so
the
wild
pagans
who
fought
under
the
standard
of
regnar
children
believed
it
was
a
power
in
itself
and
hubba
and
a
strong
fleet
were
with
it
they
had
appeared
in
the
bristol
channel
in
this
autumn
of
and
had
ruthlessly
slaughtered
and
spoiled
the
people
of
south
wales
here
they
propose
to
winter
but
as
the
country
is
wild
mountain
for
the
most
part
and
the
people
very
poor
they
will
remain
no
longer
than
they
can
help
already
a
large
part
of
the
army
about
gloster
are
getting
restless
the
story
of
their
march
from
devonshire
through
rich
districts
of
wessex
yet
unplundered
goes
round
among
the
guthrum
has
no
power
probably
no
will
to
keep
them
to
their
oaths
in
the
early
winter
a
joint
attack
is
planned
by
him
and
hubba
on
the
west
saxon
territory
by
christmas
they
are
strong
enough
to
take
the
field
and
so
in
midwinter
shortly
after
twelfth
night
the
camp
at
gloster
breaks
up
and
the
army
stole
away
to
chippenham
recrossing
the
avon
once
more
into
wessex
under
guthrum
the
fleet
after
a
short
delay
crosses
to
the
devonshire
coast
under
hubba
in
thirty
and
now
at
last
the
courage
of
the
west
saxons
gives
way
the
surprise
is
complete
wiltshire
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
pagans
who
occupying
the
royal
burgh
of
chippenham
as
headquarters
overrun
the
whole
district
drive
many
of
the
inhabitants
beyond
the
sea
for
want
of
the
necessaries
of
life
and
reduce
to
subjection
all
those
that
remain
alfred
is
at
his
post
but
for
the
moment
can
make
no
head
against
them
his
own
strong
heart
and
trust
in
god
are
left
him
and
with
them
and
a
scanty
band
of
followers
he
disappears
into
the
forest
of
selwood
which
then
stretched
away
from
the
confines
of
wiltshire
for
thirty
miles
to
the
west
east
somerset
now
one
of
the
fairest
and
richest
of
english
counties
was
then
for
the
most
part
thick
wood
and
tangled
swamp
but
miserable
as
the
lodging
is
it
is
welcome
for
the
time
to
the
king
in
the
first
months
of
selwood
forest
holds
in
its
recesses
the
hope
of
england
it
is
at
this
point
as
is
natural
enough
that
romance
has
been
most
busy
and
it
has
become
impossible
to
disentangle
the
actual
facts
from
monkish
legend
and
saxon
ballad
in
happier
times
alfred
was
in
the
habit
himself
of
talking
over
the
events
of
his
wandering
life
pleasantly
with
his
courtiers
and
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
the
foundation
of
most
of
the
stories
still
current
rests
on
those
conversations
of
the
king
noted
down
by
bishop
asser
and
others
the
best
known
of
these
is
of
course
the
story
of
the
cakes
in
the
depths
of
the
saxon
forests
there
were
always
a
few
neatherds
and
swineherds
scattered
up
and
down
living
in
rough
huts
enough
we
may
be
sure
and
occupied
with
the
care
of
the
cattle
and
herds
of
their
masters
among
these
in
selwood
was
a
neatherd
of
the
king
a
faithful
man
to
whom
the
secret
of
alfred
disguise
was
intrusted
and
who
kept
it
even
from
his
wife
to
this
man
hut
the
king
came
one
day
alone
and
sitting
himself
down
by
the
burning
logs
on
the
hearth
began
mending
his
bow
and
arrows
the
neatherd
wife
had
just
finished
her
baking
and
having
other
household
matters
to
attend
to
confided
her
loaves
to
the
king
a
poor
body
who
might
be
glad
of
the
warmth
and
could
make
himself
useful
by
turning
the
batch
and
so
earn
his
share
while
she
got
on
with
other
business
but
alfred
worked
away
at
his
weapons
thinking
of
anything
but
the
good
housewife
batch
of
loaves
which
in
due
course
were
not
only
done
but
rapidly
burning
to
a
cinder
at
this
moment
the
neatherd
wife
comes
back
and
flying
to
the
hearth
to
rescue
the
bread
cries
out
drat
the
man
never
to
turn
the
loaves
when
you
see
them
burning
warrant
you
ready
enough
to
eat
them
when
they
are
done
but
besides
the
king
faithful
neatherd
whose
name
is
not
preserved
there
are
other
churls
in
the
forest
who
must
be
alfred
comrades
just
now
if
he
will
have
any
and
even
here
he
has
an
eye
for
a
good
man
and
will
lose
no
opportunity
to
help
one
to
the
best
of
his
power
such
a
one
he
finds
in
a
certain
swineherd
called
denewulf
whom
he
gets
to
know
a
thoughtful
saxon
man
minding
his
charge
there
in
the
oak
woods
the
rough
churl
or
thrall
we
know
not
which
has
great
capacity
as
alfred
soon
finds
out
and
desire
to
learn
so
the
king
goes
to
work
upon
denewulf
under
the
oak
trees
when
the
swine
will
let
him
and
is
well
satisfied
with
the
results
of
his
teaching
and
the
progress
of
his
pupil
but
in
those
miserable
days
the
commonest
necessaries
of
life
were
hard
enough
to
come
by
for
the
king
and
his
few
companions
and
for
his
wife
and
family
who
soon
joined
him
in
the
forest
even
if
they
were
not
with
him
from
the
first
the
poor
foresters
can
not
maintain
them
nor
are
this
band
of
exiles
the
men
to
live
on
the
poor
so
alfred
and
his
comrades
are
soon
out
foraging
on
the
borders
of
the
forest
and
getting
what
subsistence
they
can
from
the
pagans
or
from
the
christians
who
had
submitted
to
their
yoke
so
we
may
imagine
them
dragging
on
life
till
near
easter
when
a
gleam
of
good
news
comes
tip
from
the
west
to
gladden
the
hearts
and
strengthen
the
arms
of
these
poor
men
in
the
depths
of
selwood
soon
after
guthrum
and
the
main
body
of
the
pagans
moved
from
gloster
southward
the
viking
hubba
as
had
been
agreed
sailed
with
thirty
from
his
winter
quarters
on
the
south
welsh
coast
and
landed
in
devon
the
news
of
the
catastrophe
at
chippenham
and
of
the
disappearance
of
the
king
was
no
doubt
already
known
in
the
west
and
in
the
face
of
it
odda
the
alderman
can
not
gather
strength
to
meet
the
pagan
in
the
open
field
but
he
is
a
brave
and
true
man
and
will
make
no
terms
with
the
spoilers
so
with
other
faithful
thanes
of
king
alfred
and
their
followers
he
throws
himself
into
a
castle
or
fort
called
cynwith
or
cynuit
there
to
abide
whatever
issue
of
this
business
god
shall
send
them
hubba
with
the
raven
and
a
host
laden
with
the
spoil
of
rich
devon
vales
appear
in
due
course
before
the
place
it
is
not
strong
naturally
and
has
only
walls
in
our
own
fashion
meaning
probably
rough
earthworks
but
there
are
resolute
men
behind
them
and
on
the
whole
hubba
declines
the
assault
and
sits
down
before
the
place
there
is
no
spring
of
water
he
hears
within
the
saxon
lines
and
they
are
otherwise
wholly
unprepared
for
a
siege
a
few
days
will
no
doubt
settle
the
matter
and
the
sword
or
slavery
will
be
the
portion
of
odda
and
the
rest
of
alfred
men
meantime
there
is
spoil
enough
in
the
camp
from
devonshire
homesteads
which
brave
men
can
revel
in
round
the
raven
while
they
watch
the
saxon
ramparts
odda
however
has
quite
other
views
than
death
from
thirst
or
surrender
before
any
stress
comes
early
one
morning
he
and
his
whole
force
sally
out
over
their
earthworks
and
from
the
first
cut
down
the
pagans
in
great
numbers
eight
hundred
and
forty
warriors
some
say
twelve
hundred
with
hubba
himself
are
slain
before
cynuit
fort
the
rest
few
in
number
escape
to
their
ships
the
raven
is
left
in
the
hands
of
odda
and
the
men
of
devon
this
is
the
news
which
comes
to
alfred
ethelnoth
the
alderman
of
somerset
denewulf
the
swineherd
and
the
rest
of
the
selwood
forest
group
some
time
before
easter
these
men
of
devonshire
it
seems
are
still
stanch
and
ready
to
peril
their
lives
against
the
pagan
no
doubt
up
and
down
wessex
thrashed
and
trodden
out
as
the
nation
is
by
this
time
there
are
other
good
men
and
true
who
will
neither
cross
the
sea
nor
the
welsh
marches
nor
make
terms
with
the
pagan
some
sprinkling
of
men
who
will
yet
set
life
at
stake
for
faith
in
christ
and
love
of
england
if
these
can
only
be
rallied
who
can
say
what
may
follow
so
in
the
lengthening
days
of
spring
council
is
held
in
selwood
and
there
will
have
been
easter
services
in
some
chapel
or
hermitage
in
the
forest
or
at
any
rate
in
some
quiet
glade
the
day
of
days
will
surely
have
had
its
voice
of
hope
for
this
poor
remnant
christ
is
risen
and
reigns
and
it
is
not
in
these
heathen
danes
or
in
all
the
northmen
who
ever
sailed
across
the
sea
to
put
back
his
kingdom
or
to
enslave
those
whom
he
has
freed
the
result
is
that
far
away
from
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
forest
on
a
rising
ground
hill
it
can
scarcely
be
called
surrounded
by
dangerous
marshes
formed
by
the
little
rivers
thone
and
parret
fordable
only
in
summer
and
even
then
dangerous
to
all
who
have
not
the
secret
a
small
fortified
camp
is
thrown
up
under
alfred
eye
by
ethelnoth
and
the
somersetshire
men
where
he
can
once
again
raise
his
standard
the
spot
has
been
chosen
by
the
king
with
the
utmost
care
for
it
is
his
last
throw
he
names
it
the
etheling
or
island
athelney
probably
his
young
son
the
etheling
of
england
is
there
among
the
first
with
his
mother
and
his
grandmother
eadburgha
the
widow
of
ethelred
mucil
the
venerable
lady
whom
asser
saw
in
later
years
and
who
has
now
no
country
but
her
daughter
there
are
as
has
been
reckoned
some
two
acres
of
hard
ground
on
the
island
and
around
vast
brakes
of
full
of
deer
and
other
game
here
the
somersetshire
men
can
keep
up
constant
communication
with
him
and
a
small
army
grows
together
they
are
soon
strong
enough
to
make
forays
into
the
open
country
and
in
many
skirmishes
they
cut
off
parties
of
the
pagans
and
supplies
for
even
when
overthrown
and
cast
down
says
malmesbury
alfred
had
always
to
be
fought
with
so
then
when
one
would
esteem
him
altogether
worn
down
and
broken
like
a
snake
slipping
from
the
hand
of
him
who
would
grasp
it
he
would
suddenly
flash
out
again
from
his
rising
up
to
smite
his
foes
in
the
height
of
their
insolent
confidence
and
never
more
hard
to
beat
than
after
a
flight
but
it
was
still
a
trying
life
at
athelney
followers
came
in
slowly
and
provender
and
supplies
of
all
kinds
are
hard
to
wring
from
the
pagan
and
harder
still
to
take
from
christian
men
one
day
while
it
was
yet
so
cold
that
the
water
was
still
frozen
the
king
people
had
gone
out
to
get
them
fish
or
fowl
or
some
such
purveyance
as
they
sustained
themselves
withal
no
one
was
left
in
the
royal
hut
for
the
moment
but
himself
and
his
eadburgha
the
king
after
his
constant
wont
whensoever
he
had
opportunity
was
reading
from
the
psalms
of
david
out
of
the
manual
which
he
carried
always
in
his
bosom
at
this
moment
a
poor
man
appeared
at
the
door
and
begged
for
a
morsel
of
bread
for
christ
his
sake
whereupon
the
king
receiving
the
stranger
as
a
brother
called
to
his
to
give
him
to
eat
eadburgha
replied
that
there
was
but
one
loaf
in
their
store
and
a
little
wine
in
a
pitcher
a
provision
wholly
insufficient
for
his
own
family
and
people
but
the
king
bade
her
nevertheless
to
give
the
stranger
part
of
the
last
loaf
which
she
accordingly
did
but
when
he
had
been
served
the
stranger
was
no
more
seen
and
the
loaf
remained
whole
and
the
pitcher
full
to
the
brim
alfred
meantime
had
turned
to
his
reading
over
which
he
fell
asleep
and
dreamt
that
cuthbert
of
lindisfarne
stood
by
him
and
told
him
it
was
he
who
had
been
his
guest
and
that
god
had
seen
his
afflictions
and
those
of
his
people
which
were
now
about
to
end
in
token
whereof
his
people
would
return
that
day
from
their
expedition
with
a
great
take
of
fish
the
king
awakening
and
being
much
impressed
with
his
dream
called
to
his
and
recounted
it
to
her
who
thereupon
assured
him
that
she
too
had
been
overcome
with
sleep
and
had
had
the
same
dream
and
while
they
yet
talked
together
on
what
had
happened
so
strangely
to
them
their
servants
come
in
bringing
fish
enough
as
it
seemed
to
them
to
have
fed
an
army
the
monkish
legend
goes
on
to
tell
that
on
the
next
morning
the
king
crossed
to
the
mainland
in
a
boat
and
wound
his
horn
thrice
which
drew
to
him
before
noon
five
hundred
men
what
we
may
think
of
the
story
and
the
dream
as
sir
john
spelman
says
is
not
here
very
much
material
seeing
that
whether
we
deem
it
natural
or
supernatural
the
one
as
well
as
the
other
serves
at
god
appointment
by
raising
or
dejecting
of
the
mind
with
hopes
or
fears
to
lead
man
to
the
resolution
of
those
things
whereof
he
has
before
ordained
the
event
alfred
we
may
be
sure
was
ready
to
accept
and
be
thankful
for
any
help
let
it
come
from
whence
it
might
and
soon
after
easter
it
was
becoming
clear
that
the
time
is
at
hand
for
more
than
skirmishing
expeditions
through
all
the
neighboring
counties
word
is
spreading
that
their
hero
king
is
alive
and
on
foot
again
and
that
there
will
be
another
chance
for
brave
men
ere
long
of
meeting
once
more
these
scourges
of
the
land
under
his
leading
a
popular
legend
is
found
in
the
later
chroniclers
which
relates
that
at
this
crisis
of
his
fortunes
alfred
not
daring
to
rely
on
any
evidence
but
that
of
his
own
senses
as
to
the
numbers
disposition
and
discipline
of
the
pagan
army
assumed
the
garb
of
a
minstrel
and
with
one
attendant
visited
the
camp
of
guthrum
here
he
stayed
showing
tricks
and
making
sport
until
he
had
penetrated
to
the
king
tents
and
learned
all
that
he
wished
to
know
after
satisfying
himself
as
to
the
chances
of
a
sudden
attack
he
returns
to
athelney
and
the
time
having
come
for
a
great
effort
if
his
people
will
but
make
it
sends
round
messengers
to
the
aldermen
and
king
thanes
of
neighboring
shires
giving
them
a
tryst
for
the
seventh
week
after
easter
the
second
week
in
may
on
or
about
the
of
may
king
alfred
left
his
island
in
the
great
wood
and
his
wife
and
children
and
such
household
gods
sic
as
he
had
gathered
round
him
there
and
came
publicly
forth
among
his
people
once
more
riding
to
egbert
stone
probably
brixton
on
the
east
of
selwood
a
distance
of
miles
here
met
him
the
men
of
the
neighboring
shires
odda
no
doubt
with
his
men
of
devonshire
full
of
courage
and
hope
after
their
recent
triumph
the
men
of
somersetshire
under
their
brave
and
faithful
alderman
ethelnoth
and
the
men
of
wilts
and
hants
such
of
them
at
least
as
had
not
fled
the
country
or
made
submission
to
the
enemy
and
when
they
saw
their
king
alive
after
such
great
tribulation
they
received
him
as
he
merited
with
joy
and
acclamation
the
gathering
had
been
so
carefully
planned
by
alfred
and
the
nobles
who
had
been
in
conference
or
correspondence
with
him
at
athelney
that
the
saxon
host
was
organized
and
ready
for
immediate
action
on
the
very
day
of
muster
whether
alfred
had
been
his
own
spy
we
can
not
tell
but
it
is
plain
that
he
knew
well
what
was
passing
in
the
pagan
camp
and
how
necessary
swiftness
and
secrecy
were
to
the
success
of
his
attack
local
traditions
can
not
be
much
relied
upon
for
events
which
took
place
a
thousand
years
ago
but
where
there
is
clearly
nothing
improbable
in
them
they
are
at
least
worth
mentioning
we
may
note
then
that
according
to
somersetshire
tradition
first
collected
by
giles
himself
a
somersetshire
man
and
one
who
besides
his
of
and
other
excellent
works
bearing
on
the
time
is
the
author
of
the
of
the
published
by
the
alfred
committee
in
the
signal
for
the
actual
gathering
of
the
west
saxons
at
stone
was
given
by
a
beacon
lighted
on
the
top
of
stourton
hill
where
alfred
tower
now
stands
such
a
beacon
would
be
hidden
from
the
danes
who
must
have
been
encamped
about
westbury
by
the
range
of
the
wiltshire
hills
while
it
would
be
visible
to
the
west
over
the
low
country
toward
the
bristol
channel
and
to
the
south
far
into
dorsetshire
not
an
hour
was
lost
by
alfred
at
the
place
of
muster
the
bands
which
came
together
there
were
composed
of
men
well
used
to
arms
each
band
under
its
own
alderman
or
reeve
the
small
army
he
had
himself
been
disciplining
at
athelney
and
training
in
skirmishes
during
the
last
few
months
would
form
a
reliable
centre
on
which
the
rest
would
have
to
form
as
best
they
could
so
after
one
day
halt
he
breaks
up
his
camp
at
egbert
stone
and
marches
to
aeglea
now
called
clay
hill
an
important
height
commanding
the
vale
to
the
north
of
westbury
which
the
danish
army
were
now
occupying
the
day
march
of
the
army
would
be
a
short
five
miles
here
the
annals
record
that
neot
his
kinsman
appeared
to
him
and
promised
that
on
the
morrow
his
misfortunes
would
end
there
are
still
traces
of
rude
earthworks
round
the
top
of
clay
hill
which
are
said
to
have
been
thrown
up
by
alfred
army
at
this
time
if
there
had
been
time
for
such
a
work
it
would
undoubtedly
have
been
a
wise
step
as
a
fortified
encampment
here
would
have
served
alfred
in
good
stead
in
case
of
a
reverse
but
the
few
hours
during
which
the
army
halted
on
clay
hill
would
have
been
quite
too
short
time
for
such
an
undertaking
which
moreover
would
have
exhausted
the
troops
it
is
more
likely
that
the
earthworks
which
are
of
the
oldest
type
similar
to
those
at
white
horse
hill
above
ashdown
were
there
long
before
alfred
arrival
in
may
after
resting
one
night
on
clay
hill
alfred
led
out
his
men
in
close
order
of
battle
against
the
pagan
host
which
lay
at
ethandune
there
has
been
much
doubt
among
the
antiquaries
as
to
the
site
of
ethandune
but
giles
and
others
have
at
length
established
the
claims
of
edington
a
village
seven
miles
from
clay
hill
on
the
northeast
to
the
spot
where
the
strength
of
the
second
wave
of
pagan
invasion
was
utterly
broken
and
rolled
back
weak
and
helpless
from
the
rock
of
the
west
saxon
kingdom
sir
john
spelman
relying
apparently
only
on
the
authority
of
nicholas
harpesfeld
history
of
puts
a
speech
into
alfred
mouth
which
he
is
supposed
to
have
delivered
before
the
battle
of
edington
he
tells
them
that
the
great
sufferings
of
the
land
had
been
yet
far
short
of
what
their
sins
had
deserved
that
god
had
only
dealt
with
them
as
a
loving
father
and
was
now
about
to
succor
them
having
already
stricken
their
foe
with
fear
and
astonishment
and
given
him
on
the
other
hand
much
encouragement
by
dreams
and
otherwise
that
they
had
to
do
with
pirates
and
robbers
who
had
broken
faith
with
them
over
and
over
again
and
the
issue
they
had
to
try
that
day
was
whether
christ
faith
or
heathenism
was
henceforth
to
be
established
in
england
there
is
no
trace
of
any
such
speech
in
the
or
asser
and
the
one
reported
does
not
ring
like
that
of
judas
maccabaeus
that
alfred
soul
was
on
fire
that
morning
on
finding
himself
once
more
at
the
head
of
a
force
he
could
rely
on
and
before
the
enemy
he
had
met
so
often
we
may
be
sure
enough
but
shall
never
know
how
the
fire
kindled
into
speech
if
indeed
it
did
so
at
all
in
such
supreme
moments
many
of
the
strongest
men
have
no
word
to
say
keep
all
their
heat
within
nor
have
we
any
clew
to
the
numbers
who
fought
on
either
side
at
ethandune
or
indeed
in
any
of
alfred
battles
in
the
there
are
only
a
few
vague
and
general
statements
from
which
little
can
be
gathered
the
most
precise
of
them
is
that
in
the
which
gives
eight
hundred
and
forty
as
the
number
of
men
who
were
slain
as
we
heard
with
hubba
before
cynuit
fort
in
devonshire
earlier
in
this
same
year
such
a
in
an
action
in
which
only
a
small
detachment
of
the
pagan
army
was
engaged
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
armies
were
far
larger
than
one
would
expect
on
the
other
hand
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
how
any
large
bodies
of
men
could
find
subsistence
in
a
small
country
which
was
the
seat
of
so
devastating
a
war
and
in
which
so
much
land
remained
still
unreclaimed
but
whatever
the
power
on
either
side
amounted
to
we
may
be
quite
sure
that
it
had
been
exerted
to
the
utmost
to
bring
as
large
a
force
as
possible
into
line
at
ethandune
guthrum
fought
to
protect
chippenham
his
base
of
operations
some
sixteen
miles
in
his
rear
and
all
the
accumulated
plunder
of
the
busy
months
which
had
passed
since
twelfth
night
and
it
is
clear
that
his
men
behaved
with
the
most
desperate
gallantry
the
fight
began
at
noon
one
chronicler
says
at
sunrise
but
the
distance
makes
this
impossible
unless
alfred
marched
in
the
night
and
lasted
through
the
greater
part
of
the
day
warned
by
many
previous
disasters
the
saxons
never
broke
their
close
order
and
so
though
greatly
outnumbered
hurled
back
again
and
again
the
onslaughts
of
the
northmen
at
last
alfred
and
his
saxons
prevailed
and
smote
his
pagan
foes
with
a
very
great
slaughter
and
pursued
them
up
to
their
fortified
camp
on
bratton
hill
or
edge
into
which
the
great
body
of
the
fugitives
threw
themselves
all
who
were
left
outside
were
slain
and
the
great
spoil
was
all
recovered
the
camp
may
still
be
seen
called
bratton
castle
with
its
double
ditches
and
deep
trenches
and
barrow
in
the
midst
sixty
yards
long
and
its
two
entrances
guarded
by
mounds
it
contains
more
than
twenty
acres
and
commands
the
whole
country
side
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
this
camp
and
not
chippenham
which
is
sixteen
miles
away
was
the
last
refuge
of
guthrum
and
the
great
northern
army
on
saxon
soil
so
in
three
days
from
the
breaking
up
of
his
little
camp
at
athelney
alfred
was
once
more
king
of
all
england
south
of
the
thames
for
this
army
of
pagans
shut
up
within
their
earthworks
on
bratton
edge
are
little
better
than
a
broken
and
disorderly
rabble
with
no
supplies
and
no
chance
of
succor
from
any
quarter
nevertheless
he
will
make
sure
of
them
and
above
all
will
guard
jealously
against
any
such
mishap
as
that
of
when
they
stole
out
of
wareham
murdered
the
horsemen
he
had
left
to
watch
them
and
got
away
to
exeter
so
bratton
camp
is
strictly
besieged
by
alfred
with
his
whole
power
guthrum
the
destroyer
and
now
the
king
of
east
anglia
the
strongest
and
ablest
of
all
the
northmen
who
had
ever
landed
in
england
is
now
at
last
fairly
in
alfred
power
at
reading
wareham
exeter
he
had
always
held
a
fortified
camp
on
a
river
easily
navigable
by
the
danish
where
he
might
look
for
speedy
succor
or
whence
at
the
worst
he
might
hope
to
escape
to
the
sea
but
now
he
with
the
remains
of
his
army
is
shut
up
in
an
inland
fort
with
no
ships
on
the
avon
the
nearest
river
even
if
they
could
cut
their
way
out
and
reach
it
and
no
hopes
of
reinforcements
overland
halfdene
is
the
nearest
viking
who
might
be
called
to
the
rescue
and
he
in
northumbria
is
far
too
distant
it
is
a
matter
of
a
few
days
only
for
food
runs
short
at
once
in
the
besieged
camp
in
former
years
or
against
any
other
enemy
guthrum
would
probably
have
preferred
to
sally
out
and
cut
his
way
through
the
saxon
lines
or
die
sword
in
hand
as
a
son
of
odin
should
whether
it
were
that
the
wild
spirit
in
him
is
thoroughly
broken
for
the
time
by
the
unexpected
defeat
at
ethandune
or
that
long
residence
in
a
christian
land
and
contact
with
christian
subjects
have
shaken
his
faith
in
his
own
gods
or
that
he
has
learned
to
measure
and
appreciate
the
strength
and
nobleness
of
the
man
he
had
so
often
deceived
at
any
rate
for
the
time
guthrum
is
subdued
at
the
end
of
fourteen
days
he
sends
to
alfred
suing
humbly
for
terms
of
any
kind
offering
on
the
part
of
the
army
as
many
hostages
as
may
be
required
without
asking
for
any
in
return
once
again
giving
solemn
pledges
to
quit
wessex
for
good
and
above
all
declaring
his
own
readiness
to
receive
baptism
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
last
proposal
we
may
doubt
whether
even
alfred
would
have
allowed
the
ruthless
foes
with
whom
he
and
his
people
had
fought
so
often
and
with
such
varying
success
to
escape
now
over
and
over
again
they
had
sworn
to
him
and
broken
their
oaths
the
moment
it
suited
their
purpose
had
given
hostages
and
left
them
to
their
fate
in
all
english
kingdoms
they
had
now
for
ten
years
been
destroying
and
pillaging
the
houses
of
god
and
slaying
even
women
and
children
they
had
driven
his
sister
husband
from
the
throne
of
mercia
and
had
grievously
tortured
the
martyr
edmund
if
ever
foe
deserved
no
mercy
guthrum
and
his
army
were
the
men
when
david
smote
the
children
of
moab
he
measured
them
with
a
line
casting
them
down
to
the
ground
even
with
two
lines
measured
he
to
put
to
death
and
with
one
full
line
to
keep
alive
when
he
took
rabbah
of
the
children
of
ammon
he
brought
forth
the
people
that
were
therein
and
put
them
under
saws
and
under
harrows
of
iron
and
under
axes
of
iron
and
made
them
pass
through
the
that
was
the
old
hebrew
method
even
under
king
david
and
in
the
ninth
century
christianity
had
as
yet
done
little
to
soften
the
old
heathen
custom
of
woe
to
the
vanquished
charlemagne
proselytizing
campaigns
had
been
as
merciless
as
mahomet
but
there
is
about
this
english
king
a
divine
patience
the
rarest
of
all
virtues
in
those
who
are
set
in
high
places
he
accepts
guthrum
proffered
terms
at
once
rejoicing
over
the
chance
of
adding
these
fierce
heathen
warriors
to
the
church
of
his
master
by
an
act
of
mercy
which
even
they
must
feel
and
so
the
remnant
of
the
army
are
allowed
to
march
out
of
their
fortified
camp
and
to
recross
the
avon
into
mercia
not
quite
five
months
after
the
day
of
their
winter
attack
and
the
seizing
of
chippenham
the
northern
army
went
away
to
cirencester
where
they
stayed
over
the
winter
and
then
returning
into
east
anglia
settled
down
there
and
alfred
and
wessex
hear
no
more
of
them
never
was
triumph
more
complete
or
better
deserved
and
in
all
history
there
is
no
instance
of
more
noble
use
of
victory
than
this
the
west
saxon
army
was
not
at
once
disbanded
alfred
led
them
back
to
athelney
where
he
had
left
his
wife
and
children
and
while
they
are
there
seven
weeks
after
the
surrender
guthrum
and
thirty
of
the
bravest
of
his
followers
arrive
to
make
good
their
pledge
the
ceremony
of
baptism
was
performed
at
wedmore
a
royal
residence
which
had
probably
escaped
the
fate
of
chippenham
and
still
contained
a
church
here
guthrum
and
his
thirty
nobles
were
sworn
in
the
soldiers
of
a
greater
king
than
woden
and
the
white
linen
cloth
the
sign
of
their
new
faith
was
bound
round
their
heads
alfred
himself
was
godfather
to
the
viking
giving
him
the
christian
name
of
athelstan
and
the
or
unbinding
of
the
sacramental
cloths
was
performed
on
the
eighth
day
by
ethelnoth
the
faithful
alderman
of
somersetshire
after
the
religious
ceremony
there
still
remained
the
task
of
settling
the
terms
upon
which
the
victors
and
vanquished
were
hereafter
to
live
together
side
by
side
in
the
same
island
for
alfred
had
the
wisdom
even
in
his
enemy
humiliation
to
accept
the
accomplished
fact
and
to
acknowledge
east
anglia
as
a
danish
kingdom
the
witenagemot
had
been
summoned
to
wedmore
and
was
sitting
there
and
with
their
advice
the
treaty
was
then
made
from
which
according
to
some
historians
english
history
begins
we
have
still
the
text
of
the
two
documents
which
together
contain
alfred
and
guthrum
peace
or
the
treaty
of
wedmore
the
first
and
shorter
being
probably
the
articles
hastily
agreed
on
before
the
capitulation
of
the
danish
army
at
chippenham
the
latter
the
final
terms
settled
between
alfred
and
his
witan
and
guthrum
and
his
thirty
nobles
after
mature
deliberation
and
conference
at
wedmore
but
not
formally
executed
until
some
years
later
the
shorter
one
that
made
at
the
capitulation
runs
as
follows
alfred
and
guthrum
this
is
the
peace
that
king
alfred
and
king
guthrum
and
the
witan
of
all
the
english
nation
and
all
the
people
that
are
in
east
anglia
have
all
ordained
and
with
oaths
confirmed
for
themselves
and
their
descendants
as
well
for
born
as
unborn
who
reck
of
god
mercy
or
of
ours
first
concerning
our
land
boundaries
these
are
upon
the
thames
and
then
upon
the
lea
and
along
the
lea
unto
its
source
then
straight
to
bedford
then
up
the
ouse
to
watling
street
then
there
is
this
if
a
man
be
slain
we
reckon
all
equally
dear
english
and
dane
at
eight
half
marks
of
pure
gold
except
the
churl
who
dwells
on
gavel
land
and
their
leisings
they
are
also
equally
dear
at
two
hundred
shillings
and
if
a
king
thane
be
accused
of
manslaughter
if
he
desire
to
clear
himself
let
him
do
so
before
twelve
thanes
if
any
man
accuse
a
man
who
is
of
less
degree
than
king
thane
let
him
clear
himself
with
eleven
of
his
equals
and
one
king
thane
and
so
in
every
suit
which
be
for
more
than
four
mancuses
and
if
he
dare
not
let
him
pay
for
it
threefold
as
it
may
be
valued
and
that
every
man
know
his
warrantor
for
men
and
for
horses
and
for
oxen
and
we
all
ordained
on
that
day
that
the
oaths
were
sworn
that
neither
bondman
nor
freeman
might
go
to
the
army
without
leave
nor
any
of
them
to
us
but
if
it
happen
that
any
of
them
from
necessity
will
have
traffic
with
us
or
we
with
them
for
cattle
or
goods
that
is
to
be
allowed
on
this
wise
that
hostages
be
given
in
pledge
of
peace
and
as
evidence
whereby
it
may
be
known
that
the
party
has
a
clean
book
by
the
treaty
alfred
is
thus
established
as
king
of
the
whole
of
england
south
of
the
thames
of
all
the
old
kingdom
of
essex
south
of
the
lea
including
london
hertford
and
albans
of
the
whole
of
the
great
kingdom
of
mercia
which
lay
to
the
west
of
watling
street
and
of
so
much
to
the
east
as
lay
south
of
the
ouse
that
he
should
have
regained
so
much
proves
the
straits
to
which
he
had
brought
the
northern
army
who
would
have
to
give
up
all
their
new
settlements
round
gloster
that
he
should
have
resigned
so
much
of
the
kingdom
which
had
acknowledged
his
grandfather
father
and
brothers
as
overlords
proves
how
formidable
his
foe
still
was
even
in
defeat
and
how
thoroughly
the
northeastern
parts
of
the
island
had
by
this
time
been
settled
by
the
danes
the
remainder
of
the
short
treaty
would
seem
simply
to
be
provisional
and
intended
to
settle
the
relations
between
alfred
subjects
and
the
army
while
it
remained
within
the
limits
of
the
new
saxon
kingdom
many
of
the
soldiers
would
have
to
break
up
their
homes
in
glostershire
and
with
this
view
the
halt
at
cirencester
is
allowed
where
as
we
have
already
heard
they
rest
until
the
winter
while
they
remain
in
the
saxon
kingdom
there
is
to
be
no
distinction
between
saxon
and
dane
the
or
is
to
be
the
same
in
each
case
for
men
of
like
rank
and
all
suits
for
more
than
four
mancuses
about
shillings
are
to
be
tried
by
a
jury
of
peers
of
the
accused
on
the
other
hand
only
necessary
communications
are
to
be
allowed
between
the
northern
army
and
the
people
and
where
there
must
be
trading
fair
and
peaceful
dealing
is
to
be
insured
by
the
giving
of
hostages
this
last
provision
and
the
clause
declaring
that
each
man
shall
know
his
warrantor
inserted
in
a
treaty
where
nothing
but
what
the
contracting
parties
must
hold
to
be
of
the
very
first
importance
would
find
place
are
another
curious
proof
of
the
care
with
which
our
ancestors
and
all
germanic
tribes
guarded
against
social
isolation
the
doctrine
that
one
man
has
nothing
to
do
with
another
a
doctrine
which
the
great
body
of
their
descendants
under
the
leading
of
schultze
delitzsch
and
others
seem
likely
to
repudiate
with
equal
emphasis
in
these
latter
days
both
in
germany
and
england
thus
in
july
the
foundations
of
the
new
kingdom
of
england
were
laid
for
new
it
undoubtedly
became
when
the
treaty
of
wedmore
was
signed
the
danish
nation
no
longer
strangers
and
enemies
are
recognized
by
the
heir
of
cerdic
as
lawful
owners
of
the
full
half
of
england
having
achieved
which
result
guthrum
and
the
rest
of
the
new
converts
leave
the
saxon
camp
and
return
to
cirencester
at
the
end
of
twelve
days
loaded
with
such
gifts
as
it
was
still
in
the
power
of
their
conquerors
to
bestow
and
alfred
was
left
in
peace
to
turn
to
a
greater
and
more
arduous
task
than
any
he
had
yet
encountered
john
richard
green
alfred
was
the
noblest
as
he
was
the
most
complete
embodiment
of
all
that
is
great
all
that
is
lovable
in
the
english
temper
he
combined
as
no
other
man
has
ever
combined
its
practical
energy
its
patient
and
enduring
force
its
profound
sense
of
duty
the
reserve
and
that
steady
in
it
a
wide
outlook
and
a
restless
daring
its
temperance
and
fairness
its
frank
geniality
its
sensitiveness
to
action
its
poetic
tenderness
its
deep
and
passionate
religion
religion
indeed
was
the
groundwork
of
alfred
character
his
temper
was
instinct
with
piety
everywhere
throughout
his
writings
that
remain
to
us
the
name
of
god
the
thought
of
god
stir
him
to
outbursts
of
ecstatic
adoration
but
he
was
no
mere
saint
he
felt
none
of
that
scorn
of
the
world
about
him
which
drove
the
nobler
souls
of
his
day
to
monastery
or
hermitage
vexed
as
he
was
by
sickness
and
constant
pain
his
temper
took
no
touch
of
asceticism
his
rare
geniality
a
peculiar
elasticity
and
mobility
of
nature
gave
color
and
charm
to
his
life
a
sunny
frankness
and
openness
of
spirit
breathe
in
the
pleasant
chat
of
his
books
and
what
he
was
in
his
books
he
showed
himself
in
his
daily
converse
alfred
was
in
truth
an
artist
and
both
the
lights
and
shadows
of
his
life
were
those
of
the
artistic
temperament
his
love
of
books
his
love
of
strangers
his
questionings
of
travellers
and
scholars
betray
an
imaginative
restlessness
that
longs
to
break
out
of
the
narrow
world
of
experience
which
hemmed
him
in
at
one
time
he
jots
down
news
of
a
voyage
to
the
unknown
seas
of
the
north
at
another
he
listens
to
tidings
which
his
envoys
bring
back
from
the
churches
of
malabar
and
side
by
side
with
this
restless
outlook
of
the
artistic
nature
he
showed
its
tenderness
and
susceptibility
its
vivid
apprehension
of
unseen
danger
its
craving
for
affection
its
sensitiveness
to
wrong
it
was
with
himself
rather
than
with
his
reader
that
he
communed
as
thoughts
of
the
foe
without
of
ingratitude
and
opposition
within
broke
the
calm
pages
of
gregory
or
boethius
oh
what
a
happy
man
was
he
he
cries
once
that
man
that
had
a
naked
sword
hanging
over
his
head
from
a
single
thread
so
as
to
me
it
always
did
desirest
thou
power
he
asks
at
another
time
but
thou
shalt
never
obtain
it
without
sorrows
sorrows
from
strange
folk
and
yet
keener
sorrows
from
thine
own
kindred
hardship
and
sorrow
he
breaks
out
again
not
a
king
but
would
wish
to
be
without
these
if
he
could
but
i
know
that
he
can
not
the
loneliness
which
breathes
in
words
like
these
has
often
begotten
in
great
rulers
a
cynical
contempt
of
men
and
the
judgments
of
men
but
cynicism
found
no
echo
in
the
large
and
sympathetic
temper
of
alfred
he
not
only
longed
for
the
love
of
his
subjects
but
for
the
remembrance
of
generations
to
come
nor
did
his
inner
gloom
or
anxiety
check
for
an
instant
his
vivid
and
versatile
activity
to
the
scholars
he
gathered
round
him
he
seemed
the
very
type
of
a
scholar
snatching
every
hour
he
could
find
to
read
or
listen
to
books
read
to
him
the
singers
of
his
court
found
in
him
a
brother
singer
gathering
the
old
songs
of
his
people
to
teach
them
to
his
children
breaking
his
renderings
from
the
latin
with
simple
verse
solacing
himself
in
hours
of
depression
with
the
music
of
the
psalms
he
passed
from
court
and
study
to
plan
buildings
and
instruct
craftsmen
in
gold
work
to
teach
even
falconers
and
their
business
but
all
this
versatility
and
ingenuity
was
controlled
by
a
cool
good
sense
alfred
was
a
thorough
man
of
business
he
was
careful
of
detail
laborious
methodical
he
carried
in
his
bosom
a
little
handbook
in
which
he
noted
things
as
they
struck
him
now
a
bit
of
family
genealogy
now
a
prayer
now
such
a
story
as
that
of
ealdhelm
playing
minstrel
on
the
bridge
each
hour
of
the
day
had
its
appointed
task
there
was
the
same
order
in
the
division
of
his
revenue
and
in
the
arrangement
of
his
court
wide
however
and
various
as
was
the
king
temper
its
range
was
less
wonderful
than
its
harmony
of
the
narrowness
of
the
want
of
proportion
of
the
predominance
of
one
quality
over
another
which
go
commonly
with
an
intensity
of
moral
purpose
alfred
showed
not
a
trace
scholar
and
soldier
artist
and
man
of
business
poet
and
saint
his
character
kept
that
perfect
balance
which
charms
us
in
no
other
englishman
save
shakespeare
but
full
and
harmonious
as
his
temper
was
it
was
the
temper
of
a
king
every
power
was
bent
to
the
work
of
rule
his
practical
energy
found
scope
for
itself
in
the
material
and
administrative
restoration
of
the
wasted
land
his
intellectual
activity
breathed
fresh
life
into
education
and
literature
his
capacity
for
inspiring
trust
and
affection
drew
the
hearts
of
englishmen
to
a
common
centre
and
began
the
upbuilding
of
a
new
england
and
all
was
guided
controlled
ennobled
by
a
single
aim
so
long
as
i
have
lived
said
the
king
as
life
closed
about
him
i
have
striven
to
live
worthily
little
by
little
men
came
to
know
what
such
a
life
of
worthiness
meant
little
by
little
they
came
to
recognize
in
alfred
a
ruler
of
higher
and
nobler
stamp
than
the
world
had
seen
never
had
it
seen
a
king
who
lived
solely
for
the
good
of
his
people
never
had
it
seen
a
ruler
who
set
aside
every
personal
aim
to
devote
himself
solely
to
the
welfare
of
those
whom
he
ruled
it
was
this
grand
that
gave
him
his
power
over
the
men
about
him
warrior
and
conqueror
as
he
was
they
saw
him
set
aside
at
thirty
the
dream
of
conquest
and
the
of
wedmore
struck
the
keynote
of
his
reign
but
still
more
is
it
this
height
and
singleness
of
purpose
this
absolute
concentration
of
the
noblest
faculties
to
the
noblest
aim
that
lifts
alfred
out
of
the
narrow
bounds
of
wessex
if
the
sphere
of
his
action
seems
too
small
to
justify
the
comparison
of
him
with
the
few
whom
the
world
owns
as
its
greatest
men
he
rises
to
their
level
in
the
moral
grandeur
of
his
life
and
it
is
this
which
has
hallowed
his
memory
among
his
own
english
people
i
desire
said
the
king
in
some
of
his
latest
words
i
desire
to
leave
to
the
men
that
come
after
me
a
remembrance
of
me
in
good
works
his
aim
has
been
more
than
fulfilled
his
memory
has
come
down
to
us
with
a
living
distinctness
through
the
mists
of
exaggeration
and
legend
which
time
gathered
round
it
the
instinct
of
the
people
has
clung
to
him
with
a
singular
affection
the
love
which
he
won
a
thousand
years
ago
has
lingered
round
his
name
from
that
day
to
this
while
every
other
name
of
those
earlier
times
has
all
but
faded
from
the
recollection
of
englishmen
that
of
alfred
remains
familiar
to
every
english
child
the
secret
of
alfred
government
lay
in
his
own
vivid
energy
he
could
hardly
have
chosen
braver
or
more
active
helpers
than
those
whom
he
employed
both
in
his
political
and
in
his
educational
efforts
the
children
whom
he
trained
to
rule
proved
the
ablest
rulers
of
their
time
but
at
the
outset
of
his
reign
he
stood
alone
and
what
work
was
to
be
done
was
done
by
the
king
himself
his
first
efforts
were
directed
to
the
material
restoration
of
his
realm
the
burnt
and
wasted
country
saw
its
towns
built
again
forts
erected
in
positions
of
danger
new
abbeys
founded
the
machinery
of
justice
and
government
restored
the
laws
codified
and
amended
still
more
strenuous
were
alfred
efforts
for
its
moral
and
intellectual
restoration
even
in
mercia
and
northumbria
the
pirate
sword
had
left
few
survivors
of
the
schools
of
egbert
or
bede
and
matters
were
even
worse
in
wessex
which
had
been
as
yet
the
most
ignorant
of
the
english
kingdoms
when
i
began
to
reign
said
alfred
i
can
not
remember
one
priest
south
of
the
thames
who
could
render
his
into
english
for
instructors
indeed
he
could
find
only
a
few
mercian
prelates
and
priests
with
one
welsh
bishop
asser
formerly
the
king
writes
bitterly
men
came
hither
from
foreign
lands
to
seek
for
instruction
and
now
when
we
desire
it
we
can
only
obtain
it
from
abroad
but
his
mind
was
far
from
being
prisoned
within
his
own
island
he
sent
a
norwegian
shipmaster
to
explore
the
white
sea
and
wulfstan
to
trace
the
coast
of
esthonia
envoys
bore
his
presents
to
the
churches
of
india
and
jerusalem
and
an
annual
mission
carried
peter
pence
to
rome
but
it
was
with
the
franks
that
his
intercourse
was
closest
and
it
was
from
them
that
he
drew
the
scholars
to
aid
him
in
his
work
of
education
a
scholar
named
grimbald
came
from
omer
to
preside
over
his
new
abbey
at
winchester
and
john
the
old
saxon
was
fetched
from
the
abbey
of
corbey
to
rule
a
monastery
and
school
that
alfred
gratitude
for
his
deliverance
from
the
danes
raised
in
the
marshes
of
athelney
the
real
work
however
to
be
done
was
done
not
by
these
teachers
but
by
the
king
himself
alfred
established
a
school
for
the
young
nobles
in
his
court
and
it
was
to
the
need
of
books
for
these
scholars
in
their
own
tongue
that
we
owe
his
most
remarkable
literary
effort
he
took
his
books
as
he
found
them
they
were
the
popular
manuals
of
his
age
the
of
the
of
pope
gregory
the
compilation
of
orosius
then
the
one
accessible
handbook
of
universal
history
and
the
history
of
his
own
people
by
bede
he
translated
these
works
into
english
but
he
was
far
more
than
a
translator
he
was
an
editor
for
the
people
here
he
omitted
there
he
expanded
he
enriched
orosius
by
a
sketch
of
the
new
geographical
discoveries
in
the
north
he
gave
a
west
saxon
form
to
his
selections
from
bede
in
one
place
he
stops
to
explain
his
theory
of
government
his
wish
for
a
thicker
population
his
conception
of
national
welfare
as
consisting
in
a
due
balance
of
priest
soldier
and
churl
the
mention
of
nero
spurs
him
to
an
outbreak
on
the
abuses
of
power
the
cold
providence
of
boethius
gives
way
to
an
enthusiastic
acknowledgment
of
the
goodness
of
god
as
he
writes
his
nature
flings
off
its
royal
mantle
and
he
talks
as
a
man
to
men
do
not
blame
me
he
prays
with
a
charming
simplicity
if
any
know
latin
better
than
i
for
every
man
must
say
what
he
says
and
do
what
he
does
according
to
his
ability
but
simple
as
was
his
aim
alfred
changed
the
whole
front
of
our
literature
before
him
england
possessed
in
her
own
tongue
one
great
poem
and
a
train
of
ballads
and
prose
she
had
none
the
mighty
roll
of
the
prose
books
that
fill
her
libraries
begins
with
the
translations
of
alfred
and
above
all
with
the
chronicle
of
his
reign
it
seems
likely
that
the
king
rendering
of
bede
history
gave
the
first
impulse
toward
the
compilation
of
what
is
known
as
the
english
or
which
was
certainly
thrown
into
its
present
form
during
his
reign
the
meagre
lists
of
the
kings
of
wessex
and
the
bishops
of
winchester
which
had
been
preserved
from
older
times
were
roughly
expanded
into
a
national
history
by
insertions
from
bede
but
it
is
when
it
reaches
the
reign
of
alfred
that
the
chronicle
suddenly
widens
into
the
vigorous
narrative
full
of
life
and
originality
that
marks
the
gift
of
a
new
power
to
the
english
tongue
varying
as
it
does
from
age
to
age
in
historic
value
it
remains
the
first
vernacular
history
of
any
teutonic
people
and
save
for
the
gothic
translations
of
ulfilas
the
earliest
and
most
venerable
monument
of
teutonic
prose
but
all
this
literary
activity
was
only
a
part
of
that
general
upbuilding
of
wessex
by
which
alfred
was
preparing
for
a
fresh
contest
with
the
stranger
he
knew
that
the
actual
winning
back
of
the
danelagh
must
be
a
work
of
the
sword
and
through
these
long
years
of
peace
he
was
busy
with
the
creation
of
such
a
force
as
might
match
that
of
the
northmen
a
fleet
grew
out
of
the
little
squadron
which
alfred
had
been
forced
to
man
with
frisian
seamen
the
national
or
levy
of
all
freemen
at
the
king
call
was
reorganized
it
was
now
divided
into
two
halves
one
of
which
served
in
the
field
while
the
other
guarded
its
own
burghs
or
boroughs
and
townships
and
served
to
relieve
its
fellow
when
the
men
forty
days
of
service
were
ended
a
more
disciplined
military
force
was
provided
by
subjecting
all
owners
of
five
hides
of
land
to
a
step
which
recognized
the
change
that
had
now
substituted
the
for
the
and
in
which
we
see
the
beginning
of
a
feudal
system
how
effective
these
measures
were
was
seen
when
the
new
resistance
they
met
on
the
continent
drove
the
northmen
to
a
fresh
attack
on
britain
in
a
large
fleet
steered
for
the
andredsweald
while
the
hasting
entered
the
thames
alfred
held
both
at
bay
through
the
year
till
the
men
of
the
danelagh
rose
at
their
comrades
call
wessex
stood
again
front
to
front
with
the
northmen
but
the
king
measures
had
made
the
realm
strong
enough
to
set
aside
its
old
policy
of
defence
for
one
of
vigorous
attack
his
son
edward
and
his
ethelred
whom
he
had
set
as
ealdorman
over
what
remained
of
mercia
showed
themselves
as

and
active

the
aim
of
the

was
to
rouse
again
the
hostility
of
the
welsh
but

by

in

was

nominal

son

became
king
in

the
race
of
charlemagne
in
germany
ended
in
by
the
death
of
ludwig
though
a
mere
child
he
had
been
enthroned
through
the
intrigues
of
otto
duke
of
saxony
and
hatto
archbishop
of
mayence
who
virtually
governed
the
empire
during
ludwig
short
reign
the
empire
at
that
time
was
composed
of
various
nations
each
under
the
rule
of
a
powerful
duke
the
bond
of
union
between
these
nations
was
slight
the
dukes
were
constantly
waging
war
against
each
other
and
these
internal
dissensions
greatly
weakened
the
central
government
at
the
same
time
the
empire
was
exposed
to
the
incursions
of
the
magyars
or
hungarians
whose
wholesale
depredations
and
cruelties
so
dismayed
the
that
he
concluded
a
treaty
of
peace
with
the
invaders
and
consented
to
pay
them
a
tribute
the
germans
were
deeply
sensible
of
the
dishonor
incurred
by
this
ignominious
tribute
and
of
the
dangers
of
their
internal
dissensions
they
longed
for
a
stronger
government
and
on
the
death
of
ludwig
the
crown
was
offered
to
otto
of
saxony
the
strongest
of
the
dukes
he
declined
in
favor
of
conrad
duke
of
franconia
a
descendant
in
the
female
line
from
charlemagne
but
conrad
rule
was
weak
and
during
his
short
reign
of
seven
years
civil
war
continued
part
of
the
time
with
henry
the
fowler
son
of
duke
otto
who
died
in
owing
to
attempt
to
separate
thuringia
from
saxony
in
order
to
weaken
ducal
power
the
empire
also
was
again
invaded
by
the
slavs
and
hungarians
conrad
died
without
male
issue
in
whereupon
the
germans
elected
as
emperor
henry
the
fowler
who
thus
became
the
first
of
the
saxon
dynasty
in
germany
and
proved
himself
to
be
the
wisest
and
most
vigorous
sovereign
who
had
ruled
in
germany
since
the
days
of
charlemagne
the
extinction
of
the
carlovingian
line
did
not
sever
the
bond
of
union
that
existed
between
the
different
nations
of
germany
although
a
contention
arose
between
them
concerning
the
election
of
the
new
emperor
each
claiming
that
privilege
for
itself
and
as
the
increase
of
the
ducal
power
had
naturally
led
to
a
wider
distinction
between
them
the
diet
convoked
for
the
purpose
represented
nations
instead
of
classes
there
were
consequently
four
nations
and
four
votes
the
franks
under
duke
conrad
whose
authority
nevertheless
could
not
compete
with
that
of
the
now
venerable
hatto
archbishop
of
mayence
who
may
be
said
to
have
been
at
that
period
the
pope
in
germany
the
saxons
frieslanders
thuringians
and
some
of
the
subdued
slavi
under
duke
otto
the
swabians
with
switzerland
and
elsace
under
different
who
as
the
immediate
officers
of
the
crown
were
named
in
order
to
distinguish
them
from
the
grafs
nominated
by
the
dukes
the
bavarians
with
the
tyrolese
and
some
of
the
subdued
eastern
slavi
under
duke
arnulf
the
bad
the
son
of
the
brave
duke
luitpold
the
lothringians
formed
a
fifth
nation
under
their
duke
regingar
but
were
at
that
period
incorporated
with
france
the
first
impulse
of
the
diet
was
to
bestow
the
crown
on
the
most
powerful
among
the
different
competitors
and
it
was
accordingly
offered
to
otto
of
saxony
who
not
only
possessed
the
most
extensive
territory
and
the
most
warlike
subjects
but
whose
authority
having
descended
to
him
from
his
father
and
grandfather
was
also
the
most
firmly
secured
but
both
otto
and
his
ancient
ally
the
bishop
hatto
had
found
the
system
they
had
hitherto
pursued
of
reigning
in
the
name
of
an
imbecile
monarch
so
greatly
conducive
to
their
interest
that
they
were
disinclined
to
abandon
it
otto
was
a
man
who
mistook
the
prudence
inculcated
by
private
interest
for
wisdom
and
his
mind
narrow
as
the
limits
of
his
dukedom
and
solely
intent
upon
the
interests
of
his
family
was
incapable
of
the
comprehensive
views
requisite
in
a
german
emperor
and
indifferent
to
the
welfare
of
the
great
body
of
the
nation
the
examples
of
boso
of
odo
of
rudolph
of
upper
burgundy
and
of
berenger
who
favored
by
the
difference
in
descent
of
the
people
they
governed
had
all
succeeded
in
severing
themselves
from
the
empire
were
ever
present
to
his
imagination
and
he
believed
that
as
on
the
other
side
of
the
rhine
the
frank
the
burgundian
and
the
lombard
severally
obeyed
an
independent
sovereign
the
east
frank
the
saxon
the
swabian
and
the
bavarian
on
this
side
of
the
rhine
were
also
desirous
of
asserting
a
similar
independence
and
that
it
would
be
easier
and
less
hazardous
to
found
a
hereditary
dukedom
in
a
powerful
and
separate
state
than
to
maintain
the
imperial
dignity
undermined
as
it
was
by
universal
hostility
the
influence
of
hatto
and
the
consent
of
otto
placed
conrad
duke
of
franconia
on
the
imperial
throne
sprung
from
a
newly
risen
family
a
mere
creature
of
the
bishop
his
nobility
as
a
feudal
lord
only
dating
from
the
period
of
the
babenberg
feud
he
was
regarded
by
the
church
as
a
pliable
tool
and
by
the
dukes
as
little
to
be
feared
his
weakness
was
quickly
demonstrated
by
his
inability
to
retain
the
rich
allods
of
the
carlovingian
dynasty
as
heir
to
the
imperial
crown
and
his
being
constrained
to
share
them
with
the
rest
of
the
dukes
he
was
nevertheless
more
fully
sensible
of
the
dignity
and
of
the
duties
of
his
station
than
those
to
whom
he
owed
his
election
probably
expected
his
first
step
was
to
recall
regingar
of
lothringia
who
was
oppressed
by
france
to
his
allegiance
as
vassal
of
the
empire
otto
died
in
and
his
son
henry
a
youth
who
had
greatly
distinguished
himself
against
the
slavi
ere
long
quarrelled
with
the
aged
bishop
hatto
according
to
the
legendary
account
the
bishop
sent
him
a
golden
chain
so
skilfully
contrived
as
to
strangle
its
wearer
the
truth
is
that
the
ancient
family
feud
between
the
house
of
conrad
and
that
of
otto
which
was
connected
with
the
babenbergers
again
broke
out
and
that
the
emperor
attempted
again
to
separate
thuringia
which
otto
had
governed
since
the
death
of
burkhard
from
saxony
in
order
to
hinder
the
overpreponderance
of
that
ducal
house
hatto
it
is
probable
counselled
this
step
as
a
considerable
portion
of
thuringia
belonged
to
the
diocese
of
mayence
and
a
collision
between
him
and
the
duke
was
therefore
unavoidable
henry
flew
to
arms
and
expelled
the
adherents
of
the
bishop
from
thuringia
which
forced
the
emperor
to
take
the
field
in
the
name
of
the
empire
against
his
haughty
vassal
this
unfortunate
civil
war
was
a
signal
for
a
fresh
irruption
of
the
slavi
and
hungarians
during
this
year
the
bohemians
and
sorbi
also
made
an
inroad
into
thuringia
and
bavaria
and
in

hungarians
advanced
as
far
as

being
surprised
near

on

bloodily
avenged

kammerboten
erchanger
and
berthold
they
were
all
with
the
exception
of
thirty
of
their
number
cut
to
pieces
arnulf
subsequently
embraced
a
contrary
line
of
policy
married
the
daughter
of
geisa
king
of
hungary
and
entered
into
a
confederacy
with
the
hungarian
and
the
swabian
kammerboten
for
the
purpose
of
founding
an
independent
state
in
the
south

had
already
strengthened
himself
by
the
appointment
of
several
markgrafs
rudiger

proved
himself
deserving
even
by

latest
act

had
so
worthily
worn

charging
his
brother

he
obeyed
the
call
of

without

and
without
manifesting
surprise
the
error
he
had
committed
in
rebelling
against

was
content
to
owe
his
election
to
the
grace
of

and
to
the
piety
of

that

left
the

wished
to
be
still
more
pious

pursue
his

with
rudolph
king

he
had
defeated

near

he
at

offered
him
peace

pardon
burkhard
seeing
himself
constrained
to
yield
took
the
oath
of
fealty
to
the
king
at
worms
but
continued
to
act
with
almost
his
former
unlimited
authority
in

even
undertook
an
expedition
into
italy
in
favor
of

he
had
become
reconciled
the

at
the
wantonness

henry
bestowed
the
dukedom
of
swabia
on
hermann
one
of
his
relations
to
whom
he
gave
burkhard
widow
in
marriage
he
also
bestowed
a
portion
of
the
south
of
alemannia
on

rudolph
in

win
him
over

in

to
dissolve
the
dukedoms

great
fiefs
henry
in

to
strengthen
the
unity
of
the
empire
introduced
the
novel
policy
of
bestowing
the
dukedoms
as
they
fell
vacant
on
his
relations
and
personal
adherents
and
of
allying
the
rest
of

by
intermarriage

still
much
in

henry
resolved
at
any
price
to
dissolve
this
dangerous
alliance
not
only
concluded
peace
with
this
traitor
on
that
condition
but
also
married
his
son
henry
to
judith
arnulf
daughter
in
arnulf
deprived
the
rich
churches
of
great
part
of
their
treasures
and
was
consequently
abhorred
by
the

the
chroniclers
of
those
times

chiefly
on
that
account
depicted
his
character
in
such
unfavorable
colors
in

charles
the

still
the

dangerous
enemy
was

himself
up

he
promised

perform
homage
as
his
liege
lord

meanwhile
contented
himself
with
expelling
rudolph
from
lotharingia

after
taking
possession
of
metz
bestowed
that
dukedom
upon
gisilbrecht
the
son
of
regingar
and
reincorporated
it
with
the

these
successes
now
roused
the
apprehensions
of

again
poured
their
invading
hordes
across
the
frontier

plundered
gall

were
routed
near

by

judicious
use
he
restored

also
agreed
to
pay
him
a
yearly
tribute
on
condition
of
his
entering
into
a
solemn
truce
for
nine
years
the
experience
of
earlier
times
had
taught
henry
that
a
completely
new
organization
was
necessary
in
the
management
of
military
affairs
in
germany
before
this
dangerous
enemy
could
be
rendered
innoxious
and
as
an
undertaking
of
this
nature
required
time
he
prudently
resolved
to
incur
a
seeming
disgrace
by
means
of
which
he
in
fact
secured
the
honor
of
the
state
during
this
interval
of
nine
years
he
aimed
at
bringing
the

enemies

but
quickly
fell
anew
into
the
power
of
his
faithless
vassals
peace
was
now
established
throughout
the
empire
and
afforded
henry
an
opportunity
for
turning
his
attention
to
the
introduction
of
measures
in
the
interior
economy
of
the
state
calculated
to
obviate
for
the
future
the
dangers
that
had
hitherto
threatened
it
from
without
the
best
expedient
against
the
irruptions
of
the
hungarians
appeared
to
him
to
be
the
circumvallation
of
the
most
important
districts
the
erection
of
forts
and
of
fortified
cities
the
most
important
point
however
was
to
place
the
garrisons
immediately
under
him
as
citizens
of
the
state
commanded
by
his
immediate
officers
instead
of
their
being
indirectly
governed
by
the
feudal
aristocracy
and
by
the
clergy
as
these
garrisons
were
intended
not
only
for
the
protection
of
the
walls
but
also
for
open
warfare
he
had
them
trained
to
fight
in
rank
and
file
and
formed
them
into
a
body
of
infantry
whose
solid
masses
were
calculated
to
withstand
the
furious
onset
of
the
hungarian
horse
these
garrisons
were
solely
composed
of
the
ancient
freemen
and
the
whole
measure
was
in
fact
merely
a
reform
of
the
ancient
which
no
longer
sufficed
for
the
protection
of
the
state
and
whose
deficiency
had
long
been
supplied
by
the
addition
of
vassals
under
the
command
of
their
temporal
or
spiritual
lieges
and
by
the
mercenaries
or
bodyguards
of
the
emperors
the
ancient
class
of
freemen
who
originally
composed
the
had
been
gradually
converted
into
feudal
vassals
but
they
were
at
that
time
still
so
numerous
as
to
enable
henry
to
give
them
a
completely
new
military
organization
which
at
once
secured
to
them
their
freedom
hitherto
endangered
by
the
preponderating
power
of
the
feudal
aristocracy
and
rendered
them
a
powerful
support
to
the
throne
by
collecting
them
into
the
cities
he
afforded
them
a
secure
retreat
against
the
attempts
of
the
grafs
dukes
abbots
and
bishops
and
created
for
himself
a
body
of
trusty
friends
of
whom
it
would
naturally
be
expected
that
they
would
ever
side
with
the
emperor
against
the
nobility
this
new
regulation
appears
to
have
been
founded
on
the
ancient
mode
of
division
at
first
out
of
every
nine
freemen
which
recalls
the
one
only
was
placed
within
the
new
fortress
and
the
remaining
eight
were
bound
perhaps
on
account
of
their
ancient
association
into
corporations
or
guilds
to
nourish
and
support
him
but
the
remaining
freemen
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
new
cities
appear
to
have
been
also
gradually
collected
within
their
walls
and
to
have
committed
the
cultivation
of
their
lands
in
the
vicinity
to
their
bondmen
however
that
may
be
the
ancient
class
of
freemen
completely
disappeared
as
the
cities
increased
in
importance
and
it
was
only
among
the
wild
mountains
where
no
cities
sprang
up
that
the
or
cantons
and
whole
districts
or
of
free
peasantry
were
to
be
met
with
henry
original
intention
in
the
introduction
of
this
new
system
was
it
is
evident
solely
to
provide
a
military
force
answering
to
the
exigencies
of
the
state
still
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
him
blind
to
the
great
political
advantage
to
be
derived
from
the
formation
of
an
independent
class
of
citizens
and
that
he
had
in
reality
premeditated
a
civil
as
well
as
a
military
reformation
may
be
concluded
from
the
fact
of
his
having
established
fairs
markets
and
public
assemblies
which
of
themselves
would
be
closely
connected
with
civil
industry
within
the
walls
of
the
cities
and
even
if
these
trading
warriors
were
at
first
merely
feudatories
of
the
emperor
they
must
naturally
in
the
end
have
formed
a
class
of
free
citizens
the
more
so
as
attracted
within
the
cities
by
the
advantages
offered
to
them
their
number
rapidly
and
annually
increased
the
same
military
reasons
which
induced
the
emperor
henry
to
enroll
the
ancient
freemen
into
a
regular
corps
of
infantry
and
to
form
them
into
a
civil
corporation
caused
him
also
to
metamorphose
the
feudal
aristocracy
into
a
regular
troop
of
cavalry
and
a
knightly
institution
the
wild
disorder
with
which
the
mounted
vassals
of
the
empire
the
dukes
grafs
bishops
and
abbots
each
distinguished
by
his
own
banner
rushed
to
the
attack
or
vied
with
each
other
in
the
fury
of
the
assault
was
now
changed
by
henry
who
was
well
versed
in
every
knightly
art
to
the
disciplined
manoeuvres
of
the
line
and
to
that
of
fighting
in
close
ranks
so
well
calculated
to
withstand
the
furious
onset
of
their
hungarian
foe
the
discipline
necessary
for
carrying
these
new
military
tactics
into
practice
among
a
nobility
habituated
to
license
could
alone
be
enforced
by
motives
of
honor
and
henry
accordingly
formed
a
chivalric
institution
which
gave
rise
to
new
manners
and
to
an
enthusiasm
that
imparted
a
new
character
to
the
age
the
tournament
from
the
ancient
verb
to
wrestle
or
fight
a
public
contest
in
every
species
of
warfare
carried
on
by
the
knights
in
the
presence
of
noble
dames
and
maidens
whose
favor
they
sought
to
gain
by
their
prowess
and
which
chiefly
consisted
of
tilting
and
jousting
either
singly
or
in
troops
the
day
concluding
with
a
banquet
and
a
dance
was
then
instituted
in
these
tournaments
the
ancient
heroism
of
the
germans
revived
they
were
in
reality
founded
upon
the
ancient
pagan
legends
of
the
heroes
who
carried
on
an
eternal
contest
in
their
walhalla
in
order
to
win
the
smiles
of
the
walkyren
now
represented
by
earth
dames
the
ancient
spirit
of
brotherhood
in
arms
which
had
been
almost
quenched
by
that
of
by
the
desire
of
acquiring
feudal
possessions
by
the
slavish
subjection
of
the
vassals
under
their
lieges
and
by
the
intrigues
of
the
bishops
who
intermeddled
with
all
feudal
matters
also
reappeared
a
great
universal
society
of
christian
knights
bound
to
the
observance
of
peculiar
laws
whose
highest
aim
was
to
fight
only
for
god
before
long
also
for
the
ladies
and
who
swore
never
to
make
use
of
dishonorable
means
for
success
but
solely
to
live
and
to
die
for
honor
was
formed
an
innovation
which
although
merely
military
in
its
origin
speedily
became
of
political
importance
for
by
means
of
this
knightly
honor
the
little
vassal
of
a
minor
lord
was
no
longer
viewed
as
a
mere
underling
but
as
a
confederate
in
the
great
universal
chivalric
fraternity
there
were
also
many
freemen
who
sometimes
gained
their
livelihood
by
offering
their
services
to
different
courts
or
by
robbing
on
the
highways
and
who
were
too
proud
to
serve
on
foot
henry
offered
them
free
pardon
and
formed
them
into
a
body
of
light
cavalry
in
the
cities
the
free
citizens
who
were
originally
intended
only
to
serve
as
foot
soldiery
appear
ere
long
to
have
formed
themselves
into
mounted
troops
and
to
have
created
a
fresh
body
of
infantry
out
of
their
artificers
and
apprentices
it
is
certain
that
every
freeman
could
pretend
to
knighthood
although
the
chivalric
regulations
ascribed
to
the
emperor
henry
and
to
his
most
distinguished
vassals
may
not
be
genuine
they
offer
nevertheless
infallible
proofs
of
the
most
ancient
spirit
of
knighthood
henry
ordained
that
no
one
should
be
created
a
knight
who
either
by
word
or
by
deed
injured
the
holy
church
the
pfalzgraf
conrad
added
no
one
who
either
by
word
or
by
deed
injured
the
holy
german
empire
hermann
of
swabia
no
one
who
injured
a
woman
or
a
maiden
berthold
the
brother
of
arnulf
of
bavaria
no
one
who
had
ever
deceived
another
or
had
broken
his
word
conrad
of
franconia
no
one
who
had
ever
run
away
from
the
field
of
battle
these
appear
to
have
been
in
fact
the
first
chivalric
laws
for
they
spring
from
the
spirit
of
the
times
while
all
the
regulations
concerning
nobility
of
birth
the
number
of
ancestors
the
exclusion
of
all
those
who
were
engaged
in
trade
are
it
is
evident
from
their
very
nature
of
a
much
later
origin
conquest
of
egypt
by
the
fatimites
stanley
it
was
the
fate
of
the
religion
which
mahomet
founded
as
it
has
been
of
other
great
systems
to
undergo
many
sectarian
divisions
and
to
be
used
as
the
instrument
of
conquest
and
political
power
when
islam
had
somewhat
departed
from
the
character
which
it
first
manifested
in
moral
sternness
and
fiery
zeal
and
had
established
itself
in
various
parts
of
the
world
on
a
basis
of
commerce
or
of
science
rather
than
that
of
its
original
inspiration
various
off
shoots
of
the
faith
began
to
assume
prominence
among
the
sects
which
sprang
up
was
one
that
claimed
to
represent
the
true
succession
of
mahomet
this
sect
was
itself
the
result
of
a
schism
among
the
adherents
of
one
of
the
two
principal
divisions
of
the
moslems
the
shiahs
they
maintained
that
ali
a
relation
and
the
adopted
son
of
mahomet
and
husband
of
his
daughter
fatima
was
the
first
legitimate
imam
or
successor
of
the
prophet
they
regarded
the
other
and
greater
division
the
sunnites
who
recognized
the
first
three
caliphs
omar
and
othman
as
usurpers
ali
was
the
fourth
caliph
and
the
sunnites
in
turn
looked
upon
his
followers
the
shiahs
as
heretics
the
schism
among
the
shiahs
grew
out
of
the
claim
of
the
schismatics
that
the
legitimate
imam
or
successor
of
the
prophet
must
be
in
the
line
of
descent
from
ali
the
sixth
imam
jaffer
upon
the
death
of
his
eldest
son
ismail
appointed
another
son
moussa
or
moses
his
heir
but
a
large
body
of
the
shiahs
denied
the
right
of
jaffer
to
make
a
new
nomination
declaring
the
imamate
to
be
strictly
hereditary
they
formed
a
new
party
of
ismailians
and
in
a
chief
of
this
sect
mahomet
surnamed
or
the
leader
a
title
of
the
shiahs
for
their
imams
revolted
in
africa
he
called
himself
a
descendant
of
ismail
and
claimed
to
be
the
legitimate
imam
he
aimed
at
the
temporal
power
of
a
caliph
and
soon
established
a
rival
caliphate
in
africa
where
he
had
obtained
a
considerable
sovereignty
the
dynasty
thus
begun
assumed
the
name
of
fatimites
in
honor
of
fatima
the
fourth
caliph
of
this
line
conquered
egypt
about
founded
the
modern
cairo
and
made
it
his
capital
the
claims
of
the
egyptian
caliphate
were
heralded
throughout
all
islam
and
its
rule
was
rapidly
extended
into
syria
and
arabia
it
played
an
important
part
in
the
history
of
the
crusades
but
in
was
abolished
by
the
famous
saladin
and
egypt
was
restored
to
the
obedience
which
it
had
formerly
owned
to
bagdad

abbassides

until
within

years
of

death
of
the
last
abbasside

hundred
and
thirty
years
had
passed
since
the
saracens
first
invaded
the
valley
of
the
nile
the
people
with
traditional
docility
had
liberally
adopted
the
religion
of
their
rulers
and
the
moslems
now
formed
the
great
majority
of
the
population
arabs
and
natives
had
blended
into
much
the
same
race
that
we
now
call
egyptians
but
so
far
the
mixture
had
not
produced
any
conspicuous
men
the
few

ikshid

foreigners
and
even
these
were
but
a
step
above
the
stereotyped
official
they
essayed
no
great
extension
of
their
dominions
they
did
not
try
to
extinguish
their
dangerous
neighbors
the
schismatic
fatimites
and
though
they
possessed
and
used
fleets
they
ventured
upon
no
excursions
against
europe
the
great
revolution
which
had
swept
over
north
africa
and
now
spread
to
egypt
arose
out
of
the
old
controversy
over
the
legitimacy
of
the
caliphate
the
prophet
mahomet
died
without
definitely
naming
a
successor
and
thereby
bequeathed
an
interminable
quarrel
to
his
followers
the
principle
of
election
thus
introduced
raised
the
first
three
caliphs
omar
othman
to

mark
for

assassination
his

of

were
excluded
from

succession
his

cruelly
persecuted
by
their
successful
rivals
the

and
the
tragedy
of

the
murder
of

the
seal
of
martyrdom
on
the

a

the
foundation
of
the
grand
interminable
schism
which
has
divided
the
mahometan
church
and
equally
destroyed
the
practice
of
charity
among
the
members
of
their
common
creed
and
endangered
the
speculative
truths
of
doctrine
the
descendants
of
ali
though
almost
universally
devoid
of
the
qualities
of
great
leaders
possessed
the
persistence
and
devotion
of
martyrs

their
sufferings
heightened
the
fanatical
enthusiasm
of
their
supporters
all
attempts
to
recover
the
temporal
power

proved
vain
the
alides
fell
back
upon
the
spiritual
authority

successive
candidates

acquired
a
more
mystical
meaning
supported
by
an
allegorical
interpretation
of
the
and
a
mysterious
influence
was
ascribed
to
the
imam
who
though
hidden
from
mortal
eye
on
account
of
the
persecution
of
his
enemies
would
soon
come
forward
publicly
in
the
character
of
the
sweep
away
the
corruptions
of
the
heretical
caliphate
and
revive
the
majesty
of
the
pure
lineage
of

mahometans
believe
in
a
coming

a
messiah
who
shall
restore
right
and
prepare
for
the
second
advent
of
mahomet
and
the
tribunal
of
the
last
day
but
the
shiahs
turned
the
expectation
to
special
account
they
taught
that
the
true
imam
though
invisible
to
mortal
sight
is
ever
living
they
predicted
the
mahdi
speedy
appearance
and
kept
their
adherents
on
the
alert
to
take
up
arms
in
his
service
with
a
view
to
his
coming
they
organized
a
pervasive
conspiracy
instituted
a
secret
society
with
carefully
graduated
stages
of
initiation
used
the
doctrines
of
all
religions
and
sects
as
weapons
in
the
propaganda
and
sent
missionaries
throughout
the
provinces
of
islam
to
increase
the
numbers
of
the
initiates
and
pave
the
way
for
the
great
revolution
we
see
their
partial
success
in
the
ravages
of
the
karmathians
who
were
the
true
parents
of
the
fatimites
the
leaders
and
chief
missionaries
had
really
nothing
in
common
with
mahometanism
among
themselves
they
were
frankly
atheists
their
objects
were
political
and
they
used
religion
in
any
form
and
adapted
it
in
all
modes
to
secure
proselytes
to
whom
they
imparted
only
so
much
of
their
doctrine
as
they
were
able
to
bear
these
men
were
furnished
with
an
armory
of
proselytism
as
perfect
perhaps
as
any
known
to
history
they
had
appeals
to
enthusiasm
and
arguments
for
the
reason
and
fuel
for
the
fiercest
passions
of
the
people
and
times
in
which
they
moved
their
real
aim
was
not
religious
or
constructive
but
pure
nihilism
they
used
the
claim
of
the
family
of
ali
not
because
they
believed
in
any
divine
right
or
any
caliphate
but
because
some
flag
had
to
be
flourished
in
order
to
rouse
the
people
one
of
these
missionaries
disguised
as
a
merchant
journeyed
back
to
barbary
in
with
some
berber
pilgrims
who
had
performed
the
sacred
ceremonies
at
mecca
he
was
welcomed
by
the
great
tribe
of
the
kitama
and
rapidly
acquired
an
extraordinary
influence
over
the
berbers
a
race
prone
to
superstition
and
easily
impressed
by
the
mysterious
rites
of
initiation
and
the
emotional
doctrines
of
the
propagandist
the
wrongs
of
the
prophetic
house
and
the
approaching
triumph
of
the
mahdi
barbary
had
never
been
much
attached
to
the
caliphate
and
for
a
century
it
had
been
practically
independent
under
the
aglabite
dynasty
the
barbarous
excesses
of
whose
later
sovereigns
had
alienated
their
subjects
alides
moreover
had
established
themselves
in
the
dynasty
of
the
idrisides
in
morocco
since
the
end
of
the
eighth
century
the
land
was
in
every
respect
ripe
for
revolution
and
the
success
of
the
new
missionary
was
extraordinarily
rapid
in
a
few
years
he
had
a
following
of
two
hundred
thousand
armed
men
and
after
a
series
of
battles
he
drove
the
last
aglabite
prince
out
of
the
country
in
the
missionary
then
proclaimed
the
imam
as
the
true
caliph
and
spiritual
head
of
islam
whether
this
was
really
a
descendant
of
ali
or
not
he
had
been
carefully
prepared
for
the
role
and
reached
barbary
in
disguise
with
the
greatest
mystery
and
some
difficulty
pursued
by
the
suspicions
of
the
bagdad
caliph
who
in
great
alarm
sent
repeated
orders
for
his
arrest
indeed
the
victorious
missionary
had
to
rescue
his
spiritual
chief
from
a
sordid
prison
at
sigilmasa
then
humbly
prostrating
himself
before
him
he
hailed
him
as
the
expected
mahdi
and
in
january
he
was
duly
prayed
for
in
the
mosque
of
kayrawan
as
the
imam
commander
of
the
faithful
the
missionary
berber
proselytes
were
too
numerous
to
encourage
resistance
and
the
few
who
indulged
the
luxury
of
conscientious
scruples
were
killed
or
imprisoned
indeed
appeared
so
secure
in
power
that
he
excited
the
jealousy
of
his
discoverer
the
missionary
now
found
himself
nobody
where
a
month
before
he
had
been
supreme
the
fatimite
restoration
was
to
him
only
a
means
to
an
end
he
had
used
title
as
an
engine
of
revolution
intending
to
proceed
to
the
furthest
lengths
of
his
philosophy
to
a
complete
social
and
political
anarchy
the
destruction
of
islam
community
of
lands
and
women
and
all
the
delight
of
unshackled
license
instead
of
this
his
creature
had
absorbed
his
power
and
all
such
designs
were
made
void
he
began
to
hatch
treason
and
to
hint
doubts
as
to
the
genuineness
of
the
mahdi
who
as
he
truly
represented
according
to
prophecy
ought
to
work
miracles
and
show
other
proofs
of
his
divine
mission
people
began
to
ask
for
a
sign
in
reply
the
mahdi
had
the
missionary
murdered
the
first
fatimite
caliph
though
without
experience
was
so
vigorous
a
ruler
that
he
could
dispense
with
the
dangerous
support
of
his
discoverer
he
held
the
throne
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
established
his
authority
more
or
less
continuously
over
the
arab
and
berber
tribes
and
settled
cities
from
the
frontier
of
egypt
to
the
province
of
fez
fas
in
morocco
received
the
allegiance
of
the
mahometan
governor
of
sicily
and
twice
despatched
expeditions
into
egypt
which
he
would
probably
have
permanently
conquered
if
he
had
not
been
hampered
by
perpetual
insurrections
in
barbary
distant
governors
and
often
whole
tribes
of
berbers
were
constantly
in
revolt
and
the
disastrous
famine
of
coupled
with
the
asiatic
plague
which
his
troops
had
brought
back
with
them
from
egypt
led
to
general
disturbances
and
insurrections
which
fully
occupied
the
later
years
of
his
reign
the
western
provinces
from
tahart
and
nakur
to
fez
and
beyond
frequently
threw
off
all
show
of
allegiance
his
authority
was
founded
more
on
fear
than
on
religious
enthusiasm
though
zeal
for
the
alide
cause
had
its
share
in
his
original
success
the
new
eastern
doctrines
as
they
were
called
were
enforced
at
the
sword
point
and
frightful
examples
were
made
of
those
who
ventured
to
tread
in
the
old
paths
nor
were
the
freethinkers
of
the
large
towns
who
shared
the
missionary
esoteric
principles
encouraged
for
outwardly
at
least
the
mahdi
was
strictly
a
moslem
when
people
at
kayrawan
began
to
put
in
practice
the
missionary
advanced
theories
to
scoff
at
all
the
rules
of
islam
to
indulge
in
free
love
pig
flesh
and
wine
they
were
sternly
brought
to
order
the
mysterious
powers
expected
of
a
mahdi
were
sedulously
rumored
among
the
credulous
berbers
though
no
miracles
were
actually
exhibited
and
the
obedience
of
the
conquered
provinces
was
secured
by
horrible
outrages
and
atrocities
of
which
the
terrified
people
dared
not
provoke
a
repetition
at
the
hands
of
the
mahdi
savage
generals
his
eldest
son
who
had
twice
led
expeditions
into
egypt
succeeded
to
the
caliphate
with
the
title
of
he
began
his
reign
with
warlike
vigor
he
sent
out
a
fleet
in
or
which
harried
the
southern
coast
of
france
blockaded
and
took
genoa
and
coasted
along
calabria
massacring
and
plundering
burning
the
shipping
and
carrying
off
slaves
wherever
it
touched
at
the
same
time
he
despatched
a
third
army
against
egypt
but
the
firm
hand
of
the
ikshid
now
held
the
government
and
his
brother
with
fifteen
thousand
horse
drove
the
enemy
out
of
alexandria
and
gave
them
a
crushing
defeat
on
their
way
home
but
for
the
greater
part
of
his
reign
was
on
the
defensive
fighting
for
existence
against
the
usurpation
of
one
who
repudiated
shiism
cursed
the
mahdi
and
his
successor
stirred
up
most
of
morocco
and
barbary
against
drove
him
out
of
his
capital
and
went
near
to
putting
an
end
to
the
fatimite
caliphate
it
was
only
after
seven
years
of
uninterrupted
civil
war
that
this
formidable
insurrection
died
out
under
the
firm
but
politic
management
of
the
third
caliph
a
brave
man
who
knew
both
when
to
strike
and
when
to
be
generous
was
at
last
run
to
earth
and
his
body
was
skinned
and
stuffed
with
straw
and
exposed
in
a
cage
with
a
couple
of
ludicrous
apes
as
a
warning
to
the
disaffected
the
fatimites
so
far
wear
a
brutal
and
barbarous
character
they
do
not
seem
to
have
encouraged
literature
or
learning
but
this
is
partly
explained
by
the
fact
that
culture
belonged
chiefly
to
the
orthodox
caliphate
and
its
learned
men
could
have
no
dealings
with
the
heretical
pretender
the
city
of
kayrawan
which
dates
from
the
arab
conquest
in
the
eighth
century
preserves
the
remains
of
some
noble
buildings
but
of
their
other
capitals
or
royal
residences
no
traces
of
art
or
architecture
remain
to
bear
witness
to
the
taste
of
their
founders
each
began
to
decay
as
soon
as
its
successor
was
built
with
the
fourth
caliph
however
the
conqueror
of
egypt
the
fatimites
entered
upon
a
new
phase
was
a
man
of
politic
temper
a
born
statesman
able
to
grasp
the
conditions
of
success
and
to
take
advantage
of
every
point
in
his
favor
he
was
also
highly
educated
and
not
only
wrote
arabic
poetry
and
delighted
in
its
literature
but
studied
greek
mastered
berber
and
sudani
dialects
and
is
even
said
to
have
taught
himself
slavonic
in
order
to
converse
with
his
slaves
from
eastern
europe
his
eloquence
was
such
as
to
move
his
audience
to
tears
to
prudent
statesmanship
he
added
a
large
generosity
and
his
love
of
justice
was
among
his
noblest
qualities
so
far
as
outward
acts
could
show
he
was
a
strict
moslem
of
the
shiah
sect
and
the
statement
of
his
adversaries
that
he
was
really
an
atheist
seems
to
rest
merely
upon
the
belief
that
all
the
fatimites
adopted
the
esoteric
doctrines
of
the
ismailian
missionaries
when
he
ascended
the
throne
in
april
he
had
already
a
policy
and
he
lost
no
time
in
carrying
it
into
execution
he
first
made
a
progress
through
his
dominions
visiting
each
town
investigating
its
needs
and
providing
for
its
peace
and
prosperity
he
bearded
the
rebels
in
their
mountain
fastnesses
till
they
laid
down
their
arms
and
fell
at
his
feet
he
conciliated
the
chiefs
and
governors
with
presents
and
appointments
and
was
rewarded
by
their
loyalty
at
the
head
of
his
ministers
he
set
gawhar
the
roman
a
slave
from
the
eastern
empire
who
had
risen
to
the
post
of
secretary
to
the
late
caliph
and
was
now
by
his
son
promoted
to
the
rank
of
commander
of
the
forces
he
was
sent
in
to
bring
the
maghreb
morocco
to
allegiance
the
expedition
was
entirely
successful
sigilmasa
and
fez
were
taken
and
gawhar
reached
the
shore
of
the
atlantic
jars
of
live
fish
and
reached
the
capital
and
proved
to
the
caliph
that
his
empire
touched
the
ocean
the
limitless
limit
of
the
world
all
the
african
littoral
from
the
atlantic
to
the
frontier
of
egypt
with
the
single
exception
of
spanish
ceuta
now
peaceably
admitted
the
sway
of
the
fatimite
caliph
the
result
was
due
partly
to
the
exhaustion
caused
by
the
long
struggle
during
the
preceding
reigns
partly
to
the
politic
concessions
and
personal
influence
of
the
able
young
ruler
he
was
liberal
and
conciliatory
toward
different
provinces
but
to
the
arabs
of
the
capital
he
was
severe
kayrawan
teemed
with
disaffected
folk
sheiks
and
theologians
bitterly
hostile
to
the
heretical
orientalism
of
the
fatimites
and
always
ready
to
excite
a
tumult
moizz
was
resolved
to
give
them
no
chance
and
one
of
his
repressive
measures
was
the
curfew
at
sunset
a
trumpet
sounded
and
anyone
found
abroad
after
that
was
liable
to
lose
not
only
his
way
but
his
head
so
long
as
they
were
quiet
however
he
used
the
people
justly
and
sought
to
impress
them
in
his
favor
in
a
singular
interview
recorded
by
makrisi
he
exhibited
himself
to
a
deputation
of
sheiks
dressed
in
the
utmost
simplicity
and
seated
before
his
writing
materials
in
a
plain
room
surrounded
by
books
he
wished
to
disabuse
them
of
the
idea
that
he
led
in
private
a
life
of
luxury
and
you
see
what
employs
me
when
i
am
alone
he
said
i
read
letters
that
come
to
me
from
the
lands
of
the
east
and
the
west
and
answer
them
with
my
own
hand
i
deny
myself
all
the
pleasures
of
the
world
and
i
seek
only
to
protect
your
lives
multiply
your
children
shame
your
rivals
and
daunt
your
enemies
then
he
gave
them
much
good
advice
and
especially
recommended
them
to
keep
to
one
wife
one
woman
is
enough
for
one
man
if
you
straitly
observe
what
i
have
ordained
he
concluded
i
trust
that
god
will
through
you
procure
our
conquest
of
the
east
in
like
manner
as
he
has
vouchsafed
us
the
west
the
conquest
of
egypt
was
indeed
the
aim
of
his
life
to
rule
over
tumultuous
arab
and
berber
tribes
in
a
poor
country
formed
no
fit
ambition
for
a
man
of
his
capacity
egypt
its
wealth
its
commerce
its
great
port
and
its
docile
population
these
were
his
dream
for
two
years
he
had
been
digging
wells
and
building
on
the
road
to
alexandria
the
west
was
now
outwardly
quiet
and
between
egypt
and
any
hope
of
succor
from
the
eastern
caliphate
stood
the
ravaging
armies
of
the
karmatis
egypt
itself
was
in
helpless
disorder
the
great
kafur
was
dead
and
its
nominal
ruler
was
a
child
the
had
made
himself
obnoxious
to
the
people
by
arrests
and
extortions
the
very
soldiery
was
in
revolt
and
the
turkish
retainers
of
the
court
mutinied
plundered
the
wazir
palace
and
even
opened
negotiations
with
moizz
hoseyn
the
nephew
of
the
ikshid
attempted
to
restore
public
order
but
after
three
months
of
vacillating
and
unpopular
government
he
returned
to
his
own
province
in
palestine
to
make
terms
with
the
karmatis
famine
the
result
of
the
exceptionally
low
nile
of
added
to
the
misery
of
the
country
plague
as
usual
followed
in
the
steps
of
famine
over
six
hundred
thousand
people
died
in
and
around
fustat
and
the
wretched
inhabitants
began
in
despair
to
migrate
to
happier
lands
all
these
matters
were
fully
reported
to
moizz
by
the
renegade
jew
yakub
killis
a
former
favorite
of
kafur
who
had
been
driven
from
egypt
by
the
jealous
exactions
of
the
wazir
and
who
was
perfectly
familiar
with
the
political
and
financial
state
of
the
nile
valley
his
representations
confirmed
the
fatimite
caliph
resolve
the
arab
tribes
were
summoned
to
his
standard
an
immense
treasure
was
collected
all
of
which
was
spent
in
the
campaign
gratuities
were
lavishly
distributed
to
the
army
and
at
the
head
of
over
one
hundred
thousand
men
all
well
mounted
and
armed
accompanied
by
a
thousand
camels
and
a
mob
of
horses
carrying
money
stores
and
ammunition
gawhar
marched
from
kayrawan
in
february
the
caliph
himself
reviewed
the
troops
the
marshal
kissed
his
hand
and
his
horse
shoe
all
the
princes
emirs
and
courtiers
passed
reverently
on
foot
before
the
honored
leader
of
the
conquering
army
who
as
a
last
proof
of
favor
received
the
gift
of
his
master
own
robes
and
charger
the
governors
of
all
the
towns
on
the
route
had
orders
to
come
on
foot
to
gawhar
stirrup
and
one
of
them
vainly
offered
a
large
bribe
to
be
excused
the
indignity
the
approach
of
this
overwhelming
force
filled
the
egyptian
ministers
with
consternation
and
they
thought
only
of
obtaining
favorable
terms
a
deputation
of
notables
headed
by
moslem
a
or
descendant
of
the
prophet
family
waited
upon
gawhar
near
alexandria
and
demanded
a
capitulation
the
general
consented
without
reserve
and
in
a
conciliatory
letter
granted
all
they
asked
but
they
had
reckoned
without
their
host
the
troops
at
fustat
would
not
listen
to
such
humiliation
and
there
was
a
strong
war
party
among
the
citizens
to
which
some
of
the
ministers
leaned
the
city
prepared
for
resistance
and
skirmishes
took
place
with
gawhar
army
which
had
meanwhile
arrived
at
the
opposite
town
of
giza
in
july
forcing
the
passage
of
the
river
with
the
help
of
some
boats
supplied
by
egyptian
soldiers
the
invaders
fell
upon
the
imposing
army
drawn
up
on
the
other
bank
and
totally
defeated
them
the
troops
deserted
fustat
in
a
panic
and
the
women
of
the
city
running
out
of
their
houses
implored
the
sherif
to
intercede
with
the
conqueror
gawhar
like
his
master
always
disposed
to
a
politic
leniency
renewed
his
former
promises
and
granted
a
complete
amnesty
to
all
who
submitted
the
overjoyed
populace
cut
off
the
heads
of
some
of
the
refractory
leaders
in
their
enthusiasm
and
sent
them
to
the
camp
in
pleasing
token
of
allegiance
a
herald
bearing
a
white
flag
rode
through
the
streets
of
fustat
proclaiming
the
amnesty
and
forbidding
pillage
and
on
august
the
the
fatimite
army
with
full
pomp
of
drums
and
banners
entered
the
capital
that
very
night
gawhar
laid
the
foundations
of
a
new
city
or
rather
fortified
palace
destined
for
the
reception
of
his
sovereign
he
was
encamped
on
the
sandy
waste
which
stretched
northeast
of
fustat
on
the
road
to
heliopolis
and
there
at
a
distance
of
about
a
mile
from
the
river
he
marked
out
the
boundaries
of
the
new
capital
there
were
no
buildings
save
the
old
convent
of
the
bones
nor
any
cultivation
except
the
beautiful
park
called
kafur
garden
to
obstruct
his
plans
a
square
somewhat
less
than
a
mile
each
way
was
pegged
out
with
poles
and
the
maghrabi
astrologers
in
whom
moizz
reposed
extravagant
faith
consulted
together
to
determine
the
auspicious
moment
for
the
opening
ceremony
bells
were
hung
on
ropes
from
pole
to
pole
and
at
the
signal
of
the
sages
their
ringing
was
to
announce
the
precise
moment
when
the
laborers
were
to
turn
the
first
sod
the
calculations
of
the
astrologers
were
however
anticipated
by
a
raven
who
perched
on
one
of
the
ropes
and
set
the
bells
jingling
upon
which
every
mattock
was
struck
into
the
earth
and
the
trenches
were
opened
it
was
an
unlucky
hour
the
planet
mars
was
in
the
ascendant
but
it
could
not
be
undone
and
the
place
was
accordingly
named
after
the
hostile
planet
the
martial
or
triumphant
in
the
hope
that
the
sinister
omen
might
be
turned
to
a
triumphant
issue
cairo
as
kahira
has
come
to
be
called
may
fairly
be
said
to
have
outlived
all
astrological
prejudices
the
name
of
the
abbasside
caliph
was
at
once
expunged
from
the
friday
prayers
at
the
old
mosque
of
amr
at
fustat
the
black
abbasside
robes
were
proscribed
and
the
preacher
in
pure
white
recited
the
khutba
for
the
imam
moizz
emir
and
invoked
blessings
on
his
ancestors
ali
and
fatima
and
all
their
holy
family
the
call
to
prayer
from
the
minarets
was
adapted
to
shiah
taste
the
joyful
news
was
sent
to
the
fatimite
caliph
on
swift
dromedaries
together
with
the
heads
of
the
slain
coins
were
struck
with
the
special
formulas
of
the
fatimite
creed
ali
is
the
noblest
of
god
delegates
the
wazir
of
the
best
of
apostles
the
imam
maadd
calls
men
to
profess
the
unity
of
the
eternal
in
addition
to
the
usual
dogmas
of
the
mahometan
faith
for
two
centuries
the
mosques
and
the
mint
proclaimed
the
shibboleth
of
the
shiahs
gawhar
set
himself
at
once
to
restore
tranquillity
and
alleviate
the
sufferings
of
the
people
moizz
had
providently
sent
grain
ships
to
relieve
their
distress
and
as
the
price
of
bread
nevertheless
remained
at
famine
rates
gawhar
publicly
flogged
the
millers
established
a
central
and
compelled
everyone
to
sell
his
corn
there
under
the
eye
of
a
government
inspector
in
spite
of
his
efforts
the
famine
lasted
for
two
years
plague
spread
alarmingly
insomuch
that
the
corpses
could
not
be
buried
fast
enough
and
were
thrown
into
the
nile
and
it
was
not
till
the
winter
of
that
plenty
returned
and
the
pest
disappeared
as
usual
the
viceroy
took
a
personal
part
in
all
public
functions
every
saturday
he
sat
in
court
assisted
by
the
wazir
the
cadi
and
skilled
lawyers
to
hear
causes
and
petitions
and
to
administer
justice
to
secure
impartiality
he
appointed
to
every
department
of
state
an
egyptian
and
a
maghrabi
officer
his
firm
and
equitable
rule
insured
peace
and
order
and
the
great
palace
he
was
building
and
the
new
mosque
the
azhar
which
he
founded
in
and
finished
in
not
only
added
to
the
beauty
of
the
capital
but
gave
employment
to
innumerable
craftsmen
the
inhabitants
of
egypt
accepted
the
new
with
their
habitual
phlegm
an
ikshidi
officer
in
the
bashmur
district
of
lower
egypt
did
indeed
incite
the
people
to
rebellion
but
his
fate
was
not
such
as
to
encourage
others
he
was
chased
out
of
egypt
captured
on
the
coast
of
palestine
and
then
it
is
gravely
recorded
he
was
given
sesame
oil
to
drink
for
a
month
till
his
skin
stripped
off
whereupon
it
was
stuffed
with
straw
and
hung
up
on
a
beam
as
a
reminder
to
him
who
would
be
admonished
with
this
brief
exception
we
read
of
no
riots
no
sectarian
risings
and
the
general
surrender
was
complete
when
the
remaining
partisans
of
the
deposed
dynasty
to
the
number
of
five
thousand
laid
down
their
arms
an
embassy
sent
to
george
king
of
nubia
to
invite
him
to
embrace
islam
and
to
exact
the
customary
tribute
was
received
with
courtesy
and
the
money
but
not
the
conversion
was
arranged
the
holy
cities
of
mecca
and
medina
in
the
higaz
where
the
gold
of
moizz
had
been
prudently
distributed
some
years
before
responded
to
his
generosity
and
success
by
proclaiming
his
supremacy
in
the
mosques
the
hamdanide
prince
who
held
northern
syria
paid
similar
homage
to
the
fatimite
caliph
at
aleppo
where
the
abbassides
had
hitherto
been
recognized
southern
syria
however
which
had
formed
part
of
the
ikshid
kingdom
did
not
submit
to
the
usurpers
without
a
struggle
hoseyn
was
still
independent
at
ramla
and
gawhar
lieutenant
giafar
ben
fellah
was
obliged
to
give
him
battle
hoseyn
was
defeated
and
exposed
bareheaded
to
the
insults
of
the
mob
at
fustat
to
be
finally
sent
with
the
rest
of
the
family
of
ikshid
to
a
barbary
jail
damascus
the
home
of
orthodoxy
was
taken
by
giafar
not
without
a
struggle
and
the
fatimite
doctrine
was
there
published
to
the
indignation
and
disgust
of
the
sunnite
population
a
worse
plague
than
the
fatimite
conquest
soon
afflicted
syria
the
karmati
leader
hasan
ben
ahmad
surnamed
finding
the
blackmail
which
he
had
lately
received
out
of
the
revenues
of
damascus
suddenly
stopped
resolved
to
extort
it
by
force
of
arms
the
fatimites
indeed
sprang
from
the
same
movement
and
their
founder
professed
the
same
political
and
irreligious
philosophy
as
hasan
himself
but
this
did
not
stand
in
his
way
and
his
knowledge
of
their
origin
made
him
the
less
disposed
to
render
homage
to
the
sacred
pretensions
of
the
new
imams
whom
he
contemptuously
designated
as
the
spawn
of
the
quacks
charlatans
and
the
enemies
of
islam
he
tried
to
enlist
the
support
of
the
abbasside
caliph
but
replied
that
fatimis
and
karmatis
were
all
one
to
him
and
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
either
the
buweyhid
prince
of
irak
however
supplied
hasan
with
arms
and
money
the
hamdanide
ruler
of
rahba
on
the
euphrates
contributed
men
and
supported
by
the
arab
tribes
of
okeyl
tavy
and
others
hasan
marched
upon
damascus
where
the
fatimites
were
routed
and
their
general
giafar
killed
moizz
was
forthwith
publicly
cursed
from
the
pulpit
in
the
syrian
capital
to
the
qualified
satisfaction
of
the
inhabitants
who
had
to
pay
handsomely
for
the
pleasure
hasan
next
marched
to
ramla
and
thence
leaving
the
fatimite
army
of
eleven
thousand
men
shut
up
in
jaffa
invaded
egypt
his
troops
surprised
kulzum
at
the
head
of
the
red
sea
and
farama
pelusium
near
the
mediterranean
at
the
two
ends
of
the
egyptian
frontier
tinnis
declared
against
the
fatimites
and
hasan
appeared
at
heliopolis
in
october
gawhar
had
already
intrenched
the
new
capital
with
a
deep
ditch
leaving
but
one
entrance
which
he
closed
with
an
iron
gate
he
armed
the
egyptians
as
well
as
the
african
troops
and
a
spy
was
set
to
watch
the
wazir
lest
he
should
be
guilty
of
treachery
the
sherifs
of
the
family
of
ali
were
summoned
to
the
camp
as
hostages
for
the
good
behavior
of
the
inhabitants
meanwhile
the
officers
of
the
enemy
were
liberally
tempted
with
bribes
two
months
they
lay
before
cairo
and
then
after
an
indecisive
engagement
hasan
stormed
the
gate
forced
his
way
across
the
ditch
and
attacked
the
egyptians
on
their
own
ground
the
result
was
a
severe
repulse
and
hasan
retreated
under
cover
of
night
to
kulzum
leaving
his
camp
and
baggage
to
be
plundered
by
the
fatimites
who
were
only
balked
of
a
sanguinary
pursuit
by
the
intervention
of
night
the
egyptian
volunteers
displayed
unexpected
valor
in
the
fight
and
many
of
the
partisans
of
the
late
dynasty
who
were
with
the
enemy
were
made
prisoners
thus
the
serious
danger
which
went
near
to
cutting
short
the
fatimite
occupation
of
egypt
was
not
only
resolutely
met
but
even
turned
into
an
advantage
there
was
no
more
intriguing
on
behalf
of
the
ikshidids
tinnis
was
recovered
from
its
temporary
defection
and
occupied
by
the
reinforcements
which
moizz
had
hurriedly
despatched
under
to
the
succor
of
gawhar
and
the
karmati
fleet
which
attempted
to
recover
this
fort
was
obliged
to
slip
anchor
abandoning
seven
ships
and
five
hundred
prisoners
jaffa
which
still
held
out
resolutely
against
the
besieging
arabs
was
now
relieved
by
the
despatch
of
african
troops
from
cairo
who
brought
back
the
garrison
but
did
not
dare
to
hold
the
post
the
enemy
fell
back
upon
damascus
and
the
leaders
fell
out
among
themselves
the
karmati
chief
was
not
crushed
however
by
his
defeat
in
the
following
year
he
was
collecting
ships
and
arabs
for
a
fresh
invasion
gawhar
who
had
long
urged
his
master
to
come
and
protect
his
conquest
now
pointed
out
the
extreme
danger
of
a
second
attack
from
an
enemy
which
had
already
succeeded
in
boldly
forcing
his
way
to
the
gate
of
cairo
moizz
had
delayed
his
journey
because
he
could
not
safely
trust
his
western
provinces
in
his
absence
but
on
the
receipt
of
this
grave
news
he
appointed
yusuf
bulugin
ben
zeyri
of
the
berber
tribe
of
sanhaga
to
act
as
his
deputy
in
barbary
left
sardaniya
the
fontainebleau
of
kayrawan
as
mansuriya
was
its
versailles
in
november
and
making
a
leisurely
progress
by
way
of
kabis
tripolis
agdabiya
and
barka
reached
alexandria
in
the
following
may
here
the
caliph
received
a
deputation
consisting
of
the
cadi
of
fustat
and
other
eminent
persons
whom
he
moved
to
tears
by
his
eloquent
and
virtuous
discourse
a
month
later
he
was
encamped
in
the
gardens
of
the
monastery
near
giza
where
he
was
reverently
welcomed
by
his
devoted
servant
gawhar
content
to
efface
himself
in
his
master
shadow
the
entry
of
the
new
caliph
into
his
new
capital
was
a
solemn
spectacle
with
him
were
all
his
sons
and
brothers
and
kinsfolk
and
before
him
were
borne
the
coffins
of
his
ancestors
fustat
was
illuminated
and
decked
for
his
reception
but
moizz
would
not
enter
the
old
capital
of
the
usurping
caliphs
he
crossed
from
roda
by
gawhar
new
bridge
and
proceeded
direct
to
the
of
cairo
here
he
threw
himself
on
his
face
and
gave
thanks
to
god
there
was
yet
an
ordeal
to
be
gone
through
before
he
could
regard
himself
as
safe
egypt
was
the
home
of
many
undoubted
sherifs
or
descendants
of
ali
and
these
headed
by
a
representative
of
the
distinguished
tabataba
family
came
boldly
to
examine
his
credentials
moizz
must
prove
his
title
to
the
holy
imamate
inherited
from
ali
to
the
satisfaction
of
these
experts
in
genealogy
according
to
the
story
the
caliph
called
a
great
assembly
of
the
people
and
invited
the
sherifs
to
appear
then
half
drawing
his
sword
he
said
here
is
my
pedigree
and
scattering
gold
among
the
spectators
added
and
there
is
my
proof
it
was
perhaps
the
best
argument
he
could
produce
the
sherifs
could
only
protest
their
entire
satisfaction
at
this
convincing
evidence
and
it
is
at
any
rate
certain
that
whatever
they
thought
of
the
claim
they
did
not
contest
it
the
capital
was
placarded
with
his
name
and
the
praises
of
ali
and
moizz
were
acclaimed
by
the
people
who
flocked
to
his
first
public
audience
among
the
presents
offered
him
that
of
gawhar
was
especially
splendid
and
its
costliness
illustrates
the
colossal
wealth
acquired
by
the
fatimites
it
included
five
hundred
horses
with
saddles
and
bridles
encrusted
with
gold
amber
and
precious
stones
tents
of
silk
and
cloth
of
gold
borne
on
bactrian
camels
dromedaries
mules
and
camels
of

filigree
coffers
full
of
gold
and
silver
vessels
swords
caskets
of
chased
silver
containing
precious
stones
a
turban
set
with
jewels
and
nine
hundred
boxes
filled
with
samples
of
all
the
goods
that
egypt
produced
growth
and
decadence
of
chivalry
tenth
to
fifteenth
century
léon
gautier
writers
on
the
history
of
chivalry
are
unable
to
refer
its
origin
to
any
definite
time
or
place
and
even
specific
definition
of
chivalry
is
seldom
attempted
by
careful
students
they
rather
give
us
as
does
gautier
in
the
picturesque
account
which
follows
some
recognized
and
for
definition
content
themselves
with
characterization
of
the
spirit
and
aims
of
chivalry
analysis
of
its
methods
and
the
story
of
its
rise
and
fall
chivalry
was
not
an
official
institution
that
came
into
existence
by
the
decree
of
a
sovereign
although
religious
in
its
original
elements
and
impulses
there
was
nothing
in
its
origin
to
remind
us
of
the
foundation
of
a
religious
order
it
would
be
useless
to
search
for
the
place
of
its
birth
or
for
the
name
of
its
founder
it
was
born
everywhere
at
once
and
has
been
everywhere
at
the
same
time
the
natural
effect
of
the
same
aspirations
and
the
same
needs
there
was
a
moment
when
people
everywhere
felt
the
necessity
of
tempering
the
ardor
of
old
german
blood
and
of
giving
to
their
passions
an
ideal
hence
chivalry
yet
chivalry
arose
from
a
german
custom
which
was
idealized
by
the
christian
church
and
chivalry
was
more
an
ideal
than
an
institution
it
was
the
christian
form
of
the
military
profession
the
knight
was
the
christian
soldier
true
the
profession
and
mission
of
the
church
meant
the
spread
of
peace
and
the
hatred
of
war
she
holding
with
her
master
that
they
who
take
the
sword
shall
perish
with
the
sword
her
thought
was
formulated
by
augustine
he
who
can
think
of
war
and
can
support
it
without
great
sorrow
is
truly
dead
to
human
feelings
it
is
necessary
he
says
to
submit
to
war
but
to
wish
for
peace
the
church
did
however
look
upon
war
as
a
divine
means
of
punishment
and
of
expiation
for
individuals
and
nations
and
the
eloquent
bossuet
showed
the
church
view
of
war
as
the
terrestrial
preparation
for
the
kingdom
of
god
and
described
how
empires
fall
upon
one
another
to
form
a
foundation
whereon
to
build
the
church
in
the
light
of
such
interpretations
the
church
availed
herself
of
the
militant
auxiliary
known
as
chivalry
along
with
the
religious
impulse
that
animated
it
chivalry
bore
throughout
its
purer
course
the
character
of
knightliness
which
it
received
from
teutonic
sources
how
the
fine
sentiments
and
ennobling
customs
of
the
teutonic
nations
particularly
with
respect
to
the
gallantry
and
generosity
of
the
male
toward
the
female
sex
grew
into
beautiful
combination
with
the
rule
of
protecting
the
weak
and
defenceless
everywhere
and
how
these
elements
were
blended
with
the
spirit
of
religious
devotion
which
entered
into
the
organization
and
practices
of
chivalry
forms
one
of
the
most
fascinating
features
in
the
study
of
its
development
and
this
gentler
side
no
less
than
its
sterner
aspects
is
faithfully
presented
in
the
brilliant
examination
of
gautier
and
the
heroic
sentiment
and
action
which
inspired
and
accomplished
the
sacred
warfare
of
the
crusades
are
not
less
admirably
depicted
in
these
pages
while
in
his
summary
of
the
decline
of
chivalry
gautier
has
perhaps
never
been
surpassed
for
penetrating
insight
and
lucid
exposition
there
is
a
sentence
of
tacitus
the
celebrated
passage
in
the
that
refers
to
a
german
rite
in
which
we
really
find
all
the
military
elements
of
the
future
chivalry
the
scene
took
place
beneath
the
shade
of
an
old
forest
the
barbarous
tribe
is
assembled
and
one
feels
that
a
solemn
ceremony
is
in
preparation
into
the
midst
of
the
assembly
advances
a
very
young
man
whom
you
can
picture
to
yourself
with
eyes
long
fair
hair
and
perhaps
some
tattooing
a
chief
of
the
tribe
is
present
who
without
delay
places
gravely
in
the
hands
of
the
young
man
a
and
a
buckler
failing
a
sovereign
ruler
it
is
the
father
of
the
youth
or
some
relative
who
undertakes
this
delivery
of
weapons
such
is
the
robe
of
these
people
as
tacitus
well
puts
it
such
is
the
first
honor
of
their
youth
till
then
the
young
man
was
only
one
in
a
family
he
becomes
by
this
rite
a
member
of
the
republic
hoc
domus
pars
videtur
mox
rei
this
sword
and
buckler
he
will
never
abandon
for
the
germans
in
all
their
acts
whether
public
or
private
are
always
armed
so
the
ceremony
finished
the
assembly
separates
and
the
tribe
reckons
a
a
warrior
the
more
that
is
all
the
solemn
handing
of
arms
to
the
young
german
such
is
the
first
germ
of
chivalry
which
christianity
was
one
day
to
animate
into
life
vetus
creandi
equites
seu
it
is
with
reason
that
comments
in
the
very
same
way
upon
the
text
of
the
and
that
a
scholar
of
our
own
days
exclaims
with
more
than
scientific
exactness
the
true
origin
of
is
this
bestowal
of
arms
which
among
the
germans
marks
the
entry
into
civil
life
no
other
origin
will
support
the
scrutiny
of
the
critic
and
he
will
not
find
anyone
now
to
support
the
theory
of
roman
origin
with
or
that
of
the
arabian
origin
with
beaumont
there
only
remains
to
explain
in
this
place
the
term
knight
chevalier
but
it
is
well
known
to
be
derived
from
which
primarily
signifies
a
beast
of
burden
a
and
has
ended
by
signifying
a
the
knight
also
has
always
preserved
the
name
of
in
the
latin
tongue
of
the
middle
ages
in
which
chivalry
is
always
called
nothing
can
be
clearer
than
this
we
do
not
intend
to
go
further
however
without
replying
to
two
objections
which
are
not
without
weight
and
which
we
do
not
wish
to
leave
behind
us
unanswered
in
a
certain
number
of
latin
books
of
the
middle
ages
we
find
to
describe
chivalry
an
expression
which
the
romanists
oppose
triumphantly
to
us
and
of
which
the
romish
origin
can
not
seriously
be
doubted
when
it
is
intended
to
signify
that
a
knight
has
been
created
it
is
stated
that
the
individual
has
been
girt
with
the
here
we
find
ourselves
in
full
roman
parlance
and
the
word
signified
certain
terms
which
described
admission
into
military
service
the
release
from
this
service
and
the
degradation
of
the
legionary
when
martin
left
the
militia
his
action
was
qualified
as
and
at
all
those
who
act
like
him
the
insulting
expression
zonis
is
cast
the
girdle
which
sustains
the
sword
of
the
roman
officer
or
rather
as
also
the
baldric
from
passed
over
the
shoulder
and
was
intended
to
support
the
weapon
of
the
common
soldier
you
perceive
quite
well
say
our
adversaries
that
we
have
to
do
with
a
roman
costume
two
very
simple
observations
will
perhaps
suffice
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
such
a
specious
argument
the
first
is
that
the
germans
in
early
times
wore
in
imitation
of
the
romans
a
wide
belt
ornamented
with
bosses
of
metal
a
baldric
by
which
their
swords
were
suspended
on
the
left
side
and
the
second
is
that
the
chroniclers
of
old
days
who
wrote
in
latin
and
affected
the
classic
style
very
naturally
adopted
the
word
in
all
its
acceptations
and
made
use
of
this
latin
paraphrasis
militari
to
express
this
solemn
adoption
of
the
sword
this
evidently
german
custom
was
always
one
of
the
principal
rites
of
the
collation
of
chivalry
there
is
then
nothing
more
in
it
than
a
somewhat
vague
reminiscence
of
a
roman
custom
with
a
very
natural
conjunction
of
terms
which
has
always
been
the
habit
of
a
literary
people
to
sum
up
the
word
is
roman
but
the
thing
itself
is
german
between
the
of
the
romans
and
the
chivalry
of
the
middle
ages
there
is
really
nothing
in
common
but
the
military
profession
considered
generally
the
official
admittance
of
the
roman
soldier
to
an
army
hierarchically
organized
in
no
way
resembled
the
admission
of
a
new
knight
into
a
sort
of
military
college
and
the
pink
of
society
as
we
read
further
the
singularly
primitive
and
barbarous
ritual
of
the
service
of
knightly
reception
in
the
twelfth
century
one
is
persuaded
that
the
words
exhale
a
german
odor
and
have
nothing
roman
about
them
but
there
is
another
argument
and
one
which
would
appear
decisive
the
roman
legionary
could
not
as
a
rule
withdraw
from
the
service
he
could
not
avoid
the
baldric
the
youthful
knight
of
the
middle
ages
on
the
contrary
was
always
free
to
arm
himself
or
not
as
he
pleased
just
as
other
cavaliers
are
at
liberty
to
leave
or
join
their
ranks
the
principal
characteristic
of
the
knightly
service
and
one
which
separates
it
most
decidedly
from
the
roman
was
its
freedom
of
action
one
very
specious
objection
is
made
as
regards
feudalism
which
some
people
obstinately
confound
with
chivalry
this
was
the
favorite
theory
of
montalembert
now
there
are
two
kinds
of
feudalism
which
the
old
feudalists
put
down
very
clearly
in
two
words
now
out
of
date
fiefs
of
dignity
and
fiefs
simple
about
the
middle
of
the
ninth
century
the
dukes
and
counts
made
themselves
independent
of
the
central
power
and
declared
that
people
owed
the
same
allegiance
to
them
as
they
did
to
the
emperor
or
the
king
such
were
the
acts
of
the
fiefs
of
dignity
and
we
may
at
once
allow
that
they
had
nothing
in
common
with
chivalry
the
fiefs
simple
then
remained
in
the
merovingian
period
we
find
a
certain
number
of
small
proprietors
called
commending
themselves
to
other
men
more
powerful
and
more
rich
who
were
called
to
his
senior
who
made
him
a
present
of
land
the
owed
assistance
and
fidelity
it
is
true
that
as
early
as
the
reign
of
charlemagne
he
followed
him
to
war
but
it
must
be
noted
that
it
was
to
the
emperor
to
the
central
power
that
he
actually
rendered
military
service
there
was
nothing
very
particular
in
this
but
the
time
was
approaching
when
things
would
be
altered
toward
the
middle
of
the
ninth
century
we
find
a
large
number
of
men
falling
on
their
knees
before
other
men
what
are
they
about
they
are
recommending
themselves
but
in
plainer
terms
protect
us
and
we
will
be
your
men
and
they
added
it
is
to
you
and
to
you
only
that
we
intend
in
future
to
render
military
service
but
in
exchange
you
must
protect
the
land
we
possess
defend
what
you
will
in
time
concede
to
us
and
defend
ourselves
these
people
on
their
knees
were
vassals
at
the
feet
of
their
lords
and
the
fief
was
generally
only
a
grant
of
land
conceded
in
exchange
for
military
service
feudalism
of
this
nature
has
nothing
in
common
with
chivalry
if
we
consider
chivalry
in
fact
as
a
kind
of
privileged
body
into
which
men
were
received
on
certain
conditions
and
with
a
certain
ritual
it
is
important
to
observe
that
every
vassal
is
not
necessarily
a
cavalier
there
were
vassals
who
with
the
object
of
averting
the
cost
of
initiation
or
for
other
reasons
remained
or
pages
all
their
lives
the
majority
of
course
did
nothing
of
the
kind
but
all
could
do
so
and
a
great
many
did
on
the
other
hand
we
see
conferred
the
dignity
of
chivalry
upon
insignificant
people
who
had
never
held
fiefs
who
owed
to
no
one
any
fealty
and
to
whom
no
one
owed
any
we
can
not
repeat
too
often
that
it
was
not
the
cavalier
or
knight
it
was
the
who
owed
military
service
or
to
the
or
lord
and
the
service
or
it
was
the
vassal
not
the
knight
who
owed
to
the
lord
relief
aid
homage
the
feudal
system
soon
became
hereditary
chivalry
on
the
contrary
has
never
been
hereditary
and
a
special
rite
has
always
been
necessary
to
create
a
knight
in
default
of
all
other
arguments
this
would
be
sufficient
but
if
instead
of
regarding
chivalry
as
an
institution
we
consider
it
as
an
ideal
the
doubt
is
not
really
more
admissible
it
is
here
that
in
the
eyes
of
a
philosophic
historian
chivalry
is
clearly
distinct
from
feudalism
if
the
western
world
in
the
ninth
century
had
been
feudalized
chivalry
would
nevertheless
have
come
into
existence
and
notwithstanding
everything
it
would
have
come
to
light
in
christendom
for
chivalry
is
nothing
more
than
the
christianized
form
of
military
service
the
armed
in
the
service
of
the
unarmed
truth
and
it
was
inevitable
that
at
some
time
or
other
it
must
have
sprung
living
and
fully
armed
from
the
brain
of
the
church
as
minerva
did
from
the
brain
of
jupiter
feudalism
on
the
contrary
is
not
of
christian
origin
at
all
it
is
a
particular
form
of
government
and
of
society
which
has
scarcely
been
less
rigorous
for
the
church
than
other
forms
of
society
and
government
feudalism
has
disputed
with
the
church
over
and
over
again
while
chivalry
has
protected
her
a
hundred
times
feudalism
is
force
chivalry
is
the
brake
let
us
look
at
godfrey
de
bouillon
the
fact
that
he
owed
homage
to
any
suzerain
the
fact
that
he
exacted
service
from
such
and
such
vassals
are
questions
which
concern
feudal
rights
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
chivalry
but
if
i
contemplate
him
in
battle
beneath
the
walls
of
jerusalem
if
i
am
a
spectator
of
his
entry
into
the
holy
city
if
i
see
him
ardent
brave
powerful
and
pure
valiant
and
gentle
humble
and
proud
refusing
to
wear
the
golden
crown
in
the
holy
city
where
jesus
wore
the
crown
of
thorns
i
am
not
then
anxious
i
am
not
curious
to
learn
from
whom
he
holds
his
fief
or
to
know
the
names
of
his
vassals
and
i
exclaim
there
is
the
knight
and
how
many
knights
what
chivalrous
virtues
have
existed
in
the
christian
world
since
feudalism
has
ceased
to
exist
the
adoption
of
arms
in
the
german
fashion
remains
the
true
origin
of
chivalry
and
the
franks
have
handed
down
this
custom
to
us
a
custom
perpetuated
to
a
comparatively
modern
period
this
simple
almost
rude
rite
so
decidedly
marked
the
line
of
civil
life
in
the
code
of
manners
of
people
of
german
origin
that
under
the
carlovingians
we
still
find
numerous
traces
of
it
in
louis
eldest
son
of
charlemagne
was
only
thirteen
years
old
and
yet
he
had
worn
the
crown
of
aquitaine
for
three
years
upon
his
baby
brow
the
king
of
the
franks
felt
that
it
was
time
to
bestow
upon
this
child
the
military
consecration
which
would
more
quickly
assure
him
of
the
respect
of
his
people
he
summoned
him
to
ingelheim
then
to
ratisbon
and
solemnly
girded
him
with
the
sword
which
makes
men
he
did
not
trouble
himself
about
the
framea
or
the
buckler
the
sword
occupied
the
first
place
it
will
retain
it
for
a
long
time
in
at
kiersy
we
have
a
similar
scene
this
time
it
is
old
louis
who
full
of
sadness
and
nigh
to
death
bestows
upon
his
son
charles
whom
he
loved
so
well
the
virile
arms
that
is
to
say
the
sword
then
immediately
afterward
he
put
upon
his
brow
the
crown
of
neustria
charles
was
fifteen
years
old
these
examples
are
not
numerous
but
their
importance
is
decisive
and
they
carry
us
to
the
time
when
the
church
came
to
intervene
positively
in
the
education
of
the
german
the
time
was
rough
and
it
is
not
easy
to
picture
a
more
distracted
period
than
that
in
the
ninth
and
tenth
centuries
the
great
idea
of
the
roman
empire
no
longer
in
the
minds
of
the
people
coincided
with
the
idea
of
the
frankish
kingdom
but
rather
inclined
so
to
speak
to
the
side
of
germany
where
it
tended
to
fix
itself
countries
were
on
the
way
to
be
formed
and
people
were
asking
to
which
country
they
could
best
belong
independent
kingdoms
were
founded
which
had
no
precedents
and
were
not
destined
to
have
a
long
life
the
saracens
were
for
the
last
time
harassing
the
southern
french
coasts
but
it
was
not
so
with
the
norman
pirates
for
they
did
not
cease
for
a
single
year
to
ravage
the
littoral
which
is
now
represented
by
the
picardy
and
normandy
coasts
until
the
day
it
became
necessary
to
cede
the
greater
part
of
it
to
them
people
were
fighting
everywhere
more
or
less
family
against
family
man
to
man
no
road
was
safe
the
churches
were
burned
there
was
universal
terror
and
everyone
sought
protection
the
king
had
no
longer
strength
to
resist
anyone
and
the
counts
made
themselves
kings
the
sun
of
the
realm
was
set
and
one
had
to
look
at
the
stars
for
light
as
soon
as
the
people
perceived
a
strong
resolute
defiant
well
established
in
his
wooden
keep
well
fortified
within
the
lines
of
his
hedge
behind
his
palisade
of
dead
branches
or
within
his
barriers
of
planks
well
posted
on
his
hill
against
his
rock
or
on
his
hillock
and
dominating
all
the
surrounding
country
as
soon
as
they
saw
this
each
said
to
him
i
am
your
man
and
all
these
weak
ones
grouped
themselves
around
the
strong
one
who
next
day
proceeded
to
wage
war
with
his
neighbors
thence
supervened
a
terrible
series
of
private
wars
everyone
was
fighting
or
thinking
of
fighting
in
addition
to
this
the
still
green
memory
of
the
grand
figure
of
charlemagne
and
the
old
empire
and
i
ca
tell
what
imperial
splendors
were
still
felt
in
the
air
of
great
cities
all
hearts
throbbed
at
the
mere
thought
of
the
saracens
and
the
holy
sepulchre
the
crusade
gathered
strength
of
preparation
far
in
advance
in
the
rage
and
indignation
of
all
the
christian
race
all
eyes
were
turned
toward
jerusalem
and
in
the
midst
of
so
many
disbandments
and
so
much
darkness
the
unity
of
the
church
survived
fallen
majesty
it
was
then
it
was
in
that
horrible
hour
the
decisive
epoch
in
our
history
that
the
church
undertook
the
education
of
the
christian
soldier
and
it
was
at
that
time
by
a
resolute
step
she
found
the
feudal
baron
in
his
rude
wooden
citadel
and
proposed
to
him
an
ideal
this
ideal
was
chivalry
that
chivalry
may
be
considered
a
great
military
confraternity
as
well
as
an
eighth
sacrament
will
be
conceded
but
before
familiarizing
themselves
with
these
ideals
the
rough
spirits
of
the
ninth
tenth
and
eleventh
centuries
had
to
learn
the
principles
of
them
the
chivalrous
ideal
was
not
conceived
all
of
a
piece
and
certainly
it
did
not
triumph
without
sustained
effort
so
it
was
by
degrees
and
very
slowly
that
the
church
succeeded
in
inoculating
the
almost
animal
intelligence
and
the
untrained
minds
of
our
ancestors
with
so
many
virtues
in
the
hands
of
the
church
which
wished
to
mould
him
into
a
christian
knight
the
feudal
baron
was
a
very
intractable
individual
no
one
could
be
more
brutal
or
more
barbarous
than
he
our
more
ancient
ballads
those
which
are
founded
on
the
traditions
of
the
ninth
and
tenth
centuries
supply
us
with
a
portrait
which
does
not
appear
exaggerated
i
know
nothing
in
this
sense
more
terrible
than
de
and
the
hero
of
this
old
poem
would
pass
for
a
type
of
a
savage
this
raoul
was
a
kind
of
sioux
or
other
redskin
who
only
wanted
tattoo
and
feathers
in
his
hair
to
be
complete
even
a
redskin
is
a
believer
or
superstitious
to
some
extent
while
raoul
defied
the
deity
himself
the
savage
respects
his
mother
as
a
rule
but
raoul
laughed
at
his
mother
who
cursed
him
behold
him
as
he
invaded
the

you
will

in

you
will

before

put

now
that

to

what
did
that
signify
to
him
he
burned
the
convent
he
burned
the

he
burned
the

among
them
was
the
mother
of
his
most
faithful
servitor
bernier
his
most
devoted
companion
and
friend
almost
his

he
burned
her
with
the
others
then
when
the
flames
were
still
burning
he
sat
himself
down
on

to

amid
the
scenes
of
his
sanguinary
exploits
defying

his
hands
steeped
in

his

that
was
the
kind
of
soldier
the
savage
of
the
tenth
century
whom
the
church
had
to
educate
unfortunately
this
raoul
de
cambrai
is
not
a
unique
specimen
he
was
not
the
only

who
had
uttered
this
ferocious
speech

aubri

to

had
he
the

to
massacre
he
knew
nothing
about

meanwhile
he
continued
to
kill
bah
he
would
say
it
is
always
an
enemy
the
less
on
one
occasion
he
slew
his
four
cousins
he
was
as
sensual
as
cruel
his
savagery
did
not
appear
to
feel
either
shame
or
remorse
he
was

and
had
a
weighty
hand
that
was

ogier
was
scarcely
any
better
but
notwithstanding
all
the
glory
attaching
to
his
name
i
know
nothing
more
saddening
than
the
final
episode
of
the
rude
poem
attributed
to
raimbert
of
paris
the
son
of
ogier
baudouinet
had
been
slain
by
the
son
of
charlemagne
who
called
himself
charlot
ogier
did
nothing
but
breathe
vengeance
and
would
not
agree
to
assist
christendom
against
the
saracen
invaders
unless
the
unfortunate
charlot
was
delivered
to
him
he
wanted
to
kill
him
he
determined
to
kill
him
and
he
rejoiced
over
it
in
anticipation
in
vain
did
charlot
humble
himself
before
this
brute
and
endeavor
to
pacify
him
by
the
sincerity
of
his
repentance
in
vain
the
old
emperor
himself
prayed
most
earnestly
to
god
in
vain
the
venerable
naimes
the
nestor
of
our
ballads
offered
to
serve
ogier
all
the
rest
of
his
life
and
begged
the
dane
not
to
forget
the
saviour
who
was
born
of
the
virgin
at
bethlehem
all
their
devotion
and
prayers
were
unavailing
ogier
pitiless
placed
one
of
his
heavy
hands
on
the
youthful
head
and
with
the
other
drew
his
sword
his
terrible
sword
courtain
nothing
less
than
the
intervention
of
an
angel
from
heaven
could
have
put
an
end
to
this
terrible
scene
in
which
all
the
savagery
of
the
german
forests
was
displayed
the
majority
of
these
early
heroes
had
no
other
shibboleth
than
i
am
going
to
separate
the
head
from
the
trunk
it
was
their
but
if
you
desire
something
more
frightful
still
something
more
primitive
you
have
only
to
open
the
at
hazard
and
read
a
few
stanzas
of
that
raging
ballad
of
and
you
will
almost
fancy
you
are
perusing
one
of
those
pages
in
which
livingstone
describes
in
such
indignant
terms
the
manners
of
some
tribe
in
central
africa
read
this
begue
struck
isore
upon
his
black
helmet
through
the
golden
circlet
cutting
him
to
the
chine
then
he
plunged
into
his
body
his
sword
flamberge
with
the
golden
hilt
took
the
heart
out
with
both
hands
and
threw
it
still
warm
at
the
head
of
william
saying
is
your
cousin
heart
you
can
salt
and
roast
it
here
words
fail
us
it
would
be
too
tame
to
say
with
goedecke
these
heroes
act
like
the
forces
of
nature
in
the
manner
of
the
hurricane
which
knows
no
pity
we
must
use
more
indignant
terms
than
these
for
we
are
truly
amid
cannibals
once
again
we
say
there
was
the
warrior
there
was
the
savage
whom
the
church
had
to
elevate
and
educate
such
is
the
point
of
departure
of
this
wonderful
progress
such
are
the
refractory
elements
out
of
which
chivalry
and
the
knight
have
been
fashioned
the
point
of
departure
is
raoul
of
cambrai
burning
origni
the
point
of
arrival
is
girard
of
roussillon
falling
one
day
at
the
feet
of
an
old
priest
and
expiating
his
former
pride
by
years
of
penitence
these
two
episodes
embrace
many
centuries
between
them
a
very
interesting
study
might
be
made
of
the
gradual
transformation
from
the
redskin
to
the
knight
it
might
be
shown
how
and
at
what
period
of
history
each
of
the
virtues
of
chivalry
penetrated
victoriously
into
the
undisciplined
souls
of
these
brutal
warriors
who
were
our
ancestors
it
might
be
determined
at
what
moment
the
church
became
strong
enough
to
impose
upon
our
knights
the
great
duties
of
defending
it
and
of
loving
one
another
this
victory
was
attained
in
a
certain
number
of
cases
undoubtedly
toward
the
end
of
the
eleventh
century
and
the
knight
appears
to
us
perfected
finished
radiant
in
the
most
ancient
edition
of
the
of
which
is
considered
to
have
been
produced
between
and
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
observe
that
chivalry
was
no
longer
in
course
of
establishment
when
pope
urban
ii
threw
with
a
powerful
hand
the
whole
of
the
christian
west
upon
the
east
where
the
tomb
of
christ
was
in
possession
of
the
infidel
in
legendary
lore
the
embodiment
of
chivalry
is
roland
in
history
it
is
godfrey
de
bouillon
there
are
no
more
worthy
names
than
these
the
decadence
of
chivalry
and
when
one
is
speaking
of
human
institutions
sooner
or
later
this
word
must
be
used
perhaps
set
in
sooner
than
historians
can
believe
we
need
not
attach
too
much
importance
to
the
grumblings
of
certain
poets
who
complain
of
their
time
with
an
evidently
exaggerated
bitterness
and
we
do
not
care
for
our
own
part
to
take
literally
the
testimony
of
the
unknown
author
of
vie
de
saint
who
exclaims
about
the
middle
of
the
eleventh
century
that
everything
is
degenerate
and
all
is
lost
thus
in
olden
times
the
world
was
good
justice
and
love
were
springs
of
action
in
it
people
then
had
faith
which
has
disappeared
from
amongst
us
the
world
is
entirely
changed
the
world
has
lost
its
healthy
color
it
is
pale
it
has
grown
old
it
is
growing
worse
and
will
soon
cease
altogether
the
poet
exaggerates
in
a
very
singular
manner
the
evil
which
he
perceives
around
him
and
one
might
aver
that
far
from
bordering
upon
old
age
chivalry
was
then
almost
in
the
very
zenith
of
its
glory
the
twelfth
century
was
its
apogee
and
it
was
not
until
the
thirteenth
that
it
manifested
the
first
symptoms
of
decay
maus
est
moult
exclaims
the
author
of
de
and
he
adds
sadly
li
biens
est
he
was
more
correct
in
speaking
thus
than
was
the
author
of
in
his
complainings
for
the
decadence
of
chivalry
actually
commenced
in
his
time
and
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
inquire
into
the
causes
of
its
decay
romance
of
the
round
which
in
the
opinion
of
prepossessed
or
thoughtless
critics
appears
so
profoundly
chivalrous
may
be
considered
one
of
the
works
which
hastened
the
downfall
of
chivalry
we
are
aware
that
by
this
seeming
paradox
we
shall
probably
scandalize
some
of
our
readers
who
look
upon
these
adventurous
cavaliers
as
veritable
knights
what
does
it
matter
que
the
heroes
of
our
de
are
really
the
authorized
representatives
and
types
of
the
society
of
their
time
and
not
those
fine
individuals
who
have
been
so
brilliantly
sketched
by
the
pencil
of
crétien
de
troyes
it
is
true
however
that
this
charming
and
delicate
spirit
did
not
give
in
his
works
an
accurate
idea
of
his
century
and
generation
we
do
not
say
that
he
embellished
all
he
touched
but
only
that
he
enlivened
it
notwithstanding
all
that
one
could
say
about
it
this
school
introduced
the
old
gaelic
spirit
into
a
poetry
which
had
been
till
then
chiefly
christian
or
german
our
epic
poems
are
of
german
origin
and
the
is
of
celtic
origin
sensual
and
light
witty
and
delicate
descriptive
and
charming
these
pleasing
romances
are
never
masculine
and
become
too
often
effeminate
and
effeminating
they
sing
always
or
nearly
so
the
same
theme
by
lovely
pasturages
clothed
with
beautiful
flowers
the
air
full
of
birds
a
young
knight
proceeds
in
search
of
the
unknown
and
through
a
series
of
adventures
whose
only
fault
is
that
they
resemble
one
another
somewhat
too
closely
we
find
insolent
defiances
magnificent
duels
enchanted
castles
tender
mysterious
talismans
the
marvellous
mingles
with
the
supernatural
magicians
with
saints
fairies
with
angels
the
whole
is
written
in
a
style
essentially
french
and
it
must
be
confessed
in
clear
polished
and
chastened
language
perfect
but
we
must
not
forget
as
we
said
just
now
that
this
poetry
so
greatly
attractive
began
as
early
as
the
twelfth
century
to
be
the
mode
universally
and
let
us
not
forget
that
it
was
at
the
same
period
that
the
and
and
the
were
written
the
two
schools
have
coexisted
for
many
centuries
both
camps
have
enjoyed
the
favor
of
the
public
but
in
such
a
struggle
it
was
all
too
easy
to
decide
to
which
of
them
the
victory
would
eventually
incline
the
ladies
decided
it
and
no
doubt
the
greater
number
of
them
wept
over
the
perusal
of
or
more
than
over
that
of
the
or
de
when
the
grand
century
of
the
middle
ages
had
closed
when
the
blatant
thirteenth
century
commenced
the
sentimental
had
already
gained
the
advantage
over
our
old
classic
and
the
new
school
the
romantic
set
of
the
triumphed
unfortunately
they
also
triumphed
in
their
manners
and
they
were
the
knights
of
the
round
table
who
with
the
valois
seated
themselves
upon
the
throne
of
france
in
this
way
temerity
replaced
true
courage
so
good
polite
manners
replaced
heroic
rudeness
so
foolish
generosity
replaced
the
charitable
austerity
of
the
early
chivalry
it
was
the
love
of
the
unforeseen
even
in
the
military
art
the
rage
for
adventure
even
in
politics
we
know
whither
this
strategy
and
these
theatrical
politics
led
us
and
that
joan
of
arc
and
providence
were
required
to
drag
us
out
of
the
consequences
the
other
causes
of
the
decadence
of
the
spirit
of
chivalry
are
more
difficult
to
determine
there
is
one
of
them
which
has
not
perhaps
been
sufficiently
brought
to
light
and
this
is
will
it
be
believed
the
exdevelopment
of
certain
orders
of
chivalry
this
statement
requires
some
explanation
we
must
confess
that
we
are
enthusiastic
passionate
admirers
of
these
grand
military
orders
which
were
formed
at
the
commencement
of
the
twelfth
century
there
have
never
been
their
like
in
the
world
and
it
was
only
given
to
christianity
to
display
to
us
such
a
spectacle
to
give
to
one
single
soul
the
double
ideal
of
the
soldier
and
the
monk
to
impose
upon
him
this
double
charge
to
fix
in
one
these
two
conditions
and
in
one
only
these
two
duties
to
cause
to
spring
from
the
earth
i
can
not
tell
how
many
thousands
of
men
who
voluntarily
accepted
this
burden
and
who
were
not
crushed
by
it
that
is
a
problem
which
one
might
have
been
pardoned
for
thinking
insoluble
we
have
not
sufficiently
considered
it
we
have
not
pictured
to
ourselves
with
sufficient
vividness
the
templars
and
the
hospitallers
in
the
midst
of
one
of
those
great
battles
in
the
holy
land
in
which
the
fate
of
the
world
was
in
the
balance
no
painters
have
not
sufficiently
portrayed
them
in
the
arid
plains
of
asia
forming
an
incomparable
squadron
in
the
midst
of
the
battle
one
might
talk
forever
and
yet
not
say
too
much
about
the
charge
of
the
cuirassiers
at
reichshoffen
but
how
many
times
did
the
hospitaller
knights
and
the
templars
charge
in
similar
fashion
those
in
truth
invented
a
new
idea
of
courage
unfortunately
they
were
not
always
fighting
and
peace
troubled
some
of
them
they
became
too
rich
and
their
riches
lowered
them
in
the
eyes
of
men
and
before
heaven
we
do
not
intend
to
adopt
all
the
calumnies
which
have
been
circulated
concerning
the
templars
but
it
is
difficult
not
to
admit
that
many
of
these
accusations
had
some
foundation
the
hospitallers
at
any
rate
have
given
no
ground
for
such
attacks
they
thank
heaven
remained
undefiled
if
not
poor
and
were
an
honor
to
that
chivalry
which
others
had
compromised
and
emasculated
but
when
all
is
said
that
which
best
became
chivalry
the
spice
which
preserved
it
the
most
surely
was
poverty
love
of
riches
had
not
only
attacked
the
chivalrous
orders
but
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
all
knights
caught
the
infection
sensuality
and
enjoyment
had
penetrated
into
their
castles
scarcely
had
they
received
the
knightly
baldric
before
they
commenced
to
break
the
commandments
and
to
pillage
the
poor
when
it
became
necessary
to
go
to
war
their
were
laden
with
wine
and
not
with
weapons
with
leathern
bottles
instead
of
swords
with
spits
instead
of
lances
one
might
have
fancied
in
truth
that
they
were
going
out
to
dinner
and
not
to
fight
it
is
true
their
shields
were
beautifully
gilt
but
they
were
kept
in
a
virgin
and
unused
condition
chivalrous
combats
were
represented
upon
their
bucklers
and
their
saddles
certainly
but
that
was
all
now
who
is
it
who
writes
thus
it
is
not
as
one
might
fancy
an
author
of
the
fifteenth
century
it
is
a
writer
of
the
twelfth
and
the
greatest
satirist
somewhat
excessive
and
unjust
in
his
statements
the
christian
juvenal
whom
we
have
just
quoted
was
none
other
than
peter
of
blois
a
hundred
other
witnesses
might
be
cited
in
support
of
these
indignant
words
but
if
there
is
some
exaggeration
in
them
we
are
compelled
to
confess
that
there
is
a
considerable
substratum
of
truth
also
these
abuses
which
wealth
engendered
which
more
than
one
poet
has
stigmatized
attracted
in
the
fourteenth
century
the
attention
of
an
important
individual
a
person
whose
name
occupies
a
worthy
place
in
literature
and
history
philip
of
mezières
chancellor
of
cyprus
under
peter
of
lusignan
was
a
true
knight
who
one
day
conceived
the
idea
of
reforming
chivalry
now
the
way
he
found
most
feasible
in
accomplishing
his
object
in
arriving
at
such
a
difficult
and
complex
reform
was
to
found
a
new
order
of
chivalry
himself
to
which
he
gave
the
title
of
the
chivalry
of
the
passion
of
christ
the
decadence
of
chivalry
is
attested
alas
by
the
very
character
of
the
reformers
by
which
this
utopian
attempted
to
oppose
it
the
good
knight
complains
of
the
great
advances
of
sensuality
and
permits
and
advises
the
marriage
of
all
knights
he
complains
of
the
accursed
riches
which
the
hospitallers
themselves
were
putting
to
a
bad
use
and
forbade
them
in
his
but
nevertheless
the
luxurious
habits
of
his
time
had
an
influence
upon
his
mind
and
he
permitted
his
knights
to
wear
the
most
extravagant
costumes
and
the
dignitaries
of
his
order
to
adopt
the
most
titles
there
was
something
mystical
in
all
this
conception
and
something
theatrical
in
all
this
agency
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
the
chivalry
of
the
passion
was
only
a
beautiful
dream
originating
in
a
generous
mind
notwithstanding
the
adherence
of
some
brilliant
personages
the
order
never
attained
to
more
than
a
theoretical
organization
and
had
only
a
fictitious
foundation
the
idea
of
the
deliverance
of
the
holy
sepulchre
from
the
infidel
was
hardly
the
object
of
the
chivalry
for
the
struggle
between
france
and
england
then
was
engaging
the
most
courageous
warriors
and
the
most
practised
swords
decay
hurried
on
apace
this
was
not
the
only
cause
of
such
a
fatal
falling
away
the
portals
of
chivalry
had
been
opened
to
too
many
unworthy
candidates
it
had
been
made
vulgar
in
consequence
of
having
become
so
cheap
the
grand
title
of
knight
was
degraded
eustace
deschamps
in
his
fine
straightforward
way
states
the
scandal
boldly
and
lashes
it
with
his
tongue
he
says
picture
to
yourself
the
fact
that
the
degree
of
knighthood
is
about
to
be
conferred
now
upon
babies
of
eight
and
ten
years
old
well
might
this
excellent
man
exclaim
in
another
place
disorders
always
go
on
gathering
strength
and
even
incomparable
knights
like
du
guesclin
and
bayard
can
not
arrest
the
fatal
course
of
the
institution
toward
ruin
chivalry
was
destined
to
disappear
it
is
very
important
that
one
should
make
one
self
acquainted
with
the
true
character
of
such
a
downfall
france
and
england
in
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
still
boasted
many
knights
they
exchanged
the
most
superb
defiances
the
most
audacious
challenges
and
proceeded
from
one
country
to
another
to
run
each
other
through
the
body
proudly
the
beaumanoirs
who
drank
their
blood
abounded
it
was
a
question
who
would
engage
himself
in
the
most
incredible
pranks
who
would
commit
the
most
daring
folly
they
tell
us
afterward
of
the
beautiful
passages
of
arms
the
grand
feats
performed
and
the
inimitable
froissart
is
the
most
charming
of
all
these
narrators
who
make
their
readers
as
chivalrous
as
themselves
but
we
must
tell
everything
among
these
knights
in
beautiful
armor
there
was
a
band
of
adventurers
who
never
observed
and
who
could
not
understand
certain
commandments
of
the
ancient
chivalry
the
laxity
of
luxury
had
everywhere
replaced
the
rigorous
enactments
of
the
old
manliness
and
even
warriors
themselves
loved
their
ease
too
much
the
religious
sentiment
was
not
the
dominant
one
in
their
minds
in
which
the
idea
of
a
crusade
now
never
entered
they
had
not
sufficient
respect
for
the
weakness
of
the
church
nor
for
other
failings
they
no
longer
felt
themselves
the
champions
of
the
good
and
the
enemies
of
evil
their
sense
of
justice
had
become
warped
as
had
love
for
their
great
native
land
again
what
they
termed
the
license
of
camps
had
grown
very
much
worse
and
we
know
in
what
condition
joan
of
arc
found
the
army
of
the
king
blasphemy
and
ribaldry
in
every
quarter
the
noble
girl
swept
away
these
pests
but
the
effect
of
her
action
was
not
she
was
the
person
to
reestablish
chivalry
which
in
her
found
the
purity
of
its
type
but
she
died
too
soon
and
had
not
sufficient
imitators
there
were
after
her
time
many
chivalrous
souls
and
thank
heaven
there
are
still
some
among
us
but
the
old
institution
is
no
longer
with
us
the
events
which
we
have
had
the
misfortune
to
witness
do
not
give
us
any
ground
to
hope
that
chivalry
extinct
and
dead
will
rise
again
to
light
and
life
in
louis
time
caricature
and
parody
they
were
forces
but
forces
nevertheless
had
already
commenced
the
work
of
destruction
we
are
in
possession
of
an
abominable
little
poem
of
the
thirteenth
century
which
is
nothing
but
a
scatological
pamphlet
directed
against
chivalry
this
ignoble
the
author
of
which
is
the
basest
of
men
is
not
the
only
attack
which
one
may
disinter
from
amid
the
literature
of
that
period
if
one
wishes
to
draw
up
a
really
complete
list
it
would
be
necessary
to
include
the
the
and
the
which
constitute
the
most
i
had
nearly
written
the
most
voltairian
works
that
i
am
acquainted
with
the
thread
is
easy
enough
to
follow
from
the
twelfth
century
down
to
the
author
of
which
i
do
not
confound
with
its
infamous
predecessors
to
cervantes
whose
work
has
been
fatal
but
whose
mind
was
elevated
however
that
may
be
parody
and
the
parodists
were
themselves
a
cause
of
decay
they
weakened
morals
they
popularized
little
sentiments
satirical
sentiments
they
inoculated
manly
souls
with
contempt
for
such
great
things
as
one
performs
disinterestedly
this
disdain
is
a
sure
element
of
decay
and
we
may
regard
it
as
an
announcement
of
death
against
the
knights
who
here
and
there
showed
themselves
unworthy
and
degenerate
was
put
in
practice
the
terrible
apparatus
of
degradation
modern
historians
of
chivalry
have
not
failed
to
describe
in
detail
all
the
rites
of
this
solemn
punishment
and
we
have
presented
to
us
a
scene
which
is
well
calculated
to
excite
the
imagination
of
the
most
and
to
make
the
most
timid
heart
swell
the
knight
judicially
condemned
to
submit
to
this
shame
was
first
conducted
to
a
scaffold
where
they
broke
or
trod
under
foot
all
his
weapons
he
saw
his
shield
with
device
effaced
turned
upside
down
and
trailed
in
the
mud
priests
after
reciting
prayers
for
the
vigil
of
the
dead
pronounced
over
his
head
the
psalm
laudem
which
contains
terrible
maledictions
against
traitors
the
herald
of
arms
who
carried
out
this
sentence
took
from
the
hands
of
the
pursuivant
of
arms
a
basin
full
of
dirty
water
and
threw
it
all
over
the
head
of
the
recreant
knight
in
order
to
wash
away
the
sacred
character
which
had
been
conferred
upon
him
by
the
accolade
the
guilty
one
degraded
in
this
way
was
subsequently
thrown
upon
a
hurdle
or
upon
a
stretcher
covered
with
a
mortuary
cloak
and
finally
carried
to
the
church
where
they
repeated
the
same
prayers
and
the
same
ceremonies
as
for
the
dead
this
was
really
terrible
even
if
somewhat
theatrical
and
it
is
easy
to
see
that
this
complicated
ritual
contained
only
a
very
few
ancient
elements
in
the
twelfth
century
the
ceremonial
of
degradation
was
infinitely
more
simple
the
spurs
were
hacked
off
close
to
the
heels
of
the
guilty
knight
nothing
could
be
more
summary
or
more
significant
such
a
person
was
publicly
denounced
as
unworthy
to
ride
on
horseback
and
consequently
quite
unworthy
to
be
a
knight
the
more
ancient
and
chivalrous
the
less
theatrical
is
it
it
is
so
in
many
other
institutions
in
the
histories
of
all
nations
that
such
a
penalty
may
have
prevented
a
certain
number
of
treasons
and
forfeitures
we
willingly
admit
but
one
can
not
expect
it
to
preserve
all
the
whole
body
of
chivalry
from
that
decadence
from
which
no
institution
of
human
establishment
can
escape
notwithstanding
inevitable
weaknesses
and
accidents
the
decalogue
of
chivalry
has
none
the
less
been
regnant
in
some
millions
of
souls
which
it
has
made
pure
and
great
these
ten
commandments
have
been
the
rules
and
the
reins
of
youthful
generations
who
without
them
would
have
been
wild
and
undisciplined
this
legislation
in
fact
which
to
tell
the
truth
is
only
one
of
the
chapters
of
the
great
catholic
code
has
raised
the
moral
level
of
humanity
besides
chivalry
is
not
yet
quite
dead
no
doubt
the
ritual
of
chivalry
the
solemn
reception
the
order
itself
and
the
ancient
oaths
no
longer
exist
no
doubt
among
these
grand
commandments
there
are
many
which
are
known
only
to
the
erudite
and
which
the
world
is
unacquainted
with
the
catholic
faith
is
no
longer
the
essence
of
modern
chivalry
the
church
is
no
longer
seated
on
the
throne
around
which
the
old
knights
stand
with
their
drawn
swords
islam
is
no
longer
the
hereditary
enemy
we
have
another
which
threatens
us
nearer
home
widows
and
orphans
have
need
rather
of
the
tongues
of
advocates
than
of
the
iron
weapon
of
the
knights
there
are
no
more
duties
toward
to
be
fulfilled
and
we
even
do
not
want
any
kind
of
superior
lord
at
all
is
now
confounded
with
charity
and
the
becoming
hatred
of
is
no
longer
our
chief
our
best
passion
but
whatever
we
may
do
there
still
remains
to
us
in
the
marrow
a
certain
leaven
of
chivalry
which
preserves
us
from
death
there
are
still
in
the
world
an
immense
number
of
fine
souls
strong
and
upright
souls
who
hate
all
that
is
small
and
mean
who
know
and
who
practise
all
the
delicate
promptings
of
honor
and
who
prefer
death
to
an
unworthy
action
or
to
a
lie
that
is
what
we
owe
to
chivalry
that
is
what
it
has
bequeathed
to
us
on
the
day
when
these
last
vestiges
of
such
a
grand
past
are
effaced
from
our
souls
we
shall
cease
to
exist

however

looked
upon
as
the
sarmatians
already
mentioned
the
slavs

north
as

especially
becoming
an
important
commercial
and
trading
centre
the

scandinavian
northmen
known
as
varangians

demanded
tribute
of
the
slavs

on
its
refusal
attacked
and
captured
novgorod
a
little
later
novgorod
established
its
independence
as
a
republic
but
within
a
few
years
we
find
this
section
controlled
by
a
varangian
tribe
from

numerous
invasions
into
the

of
the

were

constantinople
was
frequently
attacked
resulting
sometimes
in
repulse
and
at
others
in
exacting
heavy
tribute
from

were
executed
and
a

place
olga
the
famous
and
popular
widow
of
ruric
son
igor
became
a
christian
and
was
baptized
in
constantinople
in
and
during
the
rest
of
her
life
lent
her
powerful
influence
to
the
spread
of
the
faith
and
though
her
son
the
emperor
sviatoslaf
remained
a
pagan
throughout
his
reign
christianity
continued
to
grow
and
the
general
christianization
of
russia
during
the
reign
of
her
grandson
vladimir
was
aided
materially
by
the
great
example
of

the

russia
increased
in
importance
and
civilization
was
enhanced
by
the
spread
of
christianity
through
the
missionary
efforts
of
the
greek
church
now
the
holy
orthodox
catholic
apostolic
oriental
church
it
is
therefore
not
strange
that
the
russian
prelates
were
distinguished
by
their
loyalty
and
fidelity
to
the
greek
church
throughout
the
continued
conflicts
between
it
and
the
roman
church
which
resulted
in
their
separation
in
in
the
fifteenth
century
with
the
consent
of
the
patriarchate
of
constantinople
the
orthodox
church
assumed
national
independence
and
became
the
state
church
and
after
the
establishment
of
mahometanism
in
constantinople
since
its
capture
by
mahomet
ii
in
the
reigning
czar
of
russia
has
come
to
be
regarded
not
only
as
the
temporal
and
spiritual
head
of
the
greek
church
by
the
great
mass
of
adherents
which
form
the
bulk
of
the
population
in
russia
but
also
as
the
champion
of
all
the
followers
of
the
church
in
greece
and
throughout
the
orient
the
story
of
the
introduction
of
christianity
into
russia
presents
an
interesting
psychological
study
of
the
growth
and
development
of
the
religious
sentiment
inherent
in
man
be
he
never
so
brutalized
and
barbarous
notwithstanding
its
display
of
national
pride
and
bias
pardonable
in
a
native
historian
mouravieff
account
is
exceedingly
interesting
the
russian
church
like
the
other
orthodox
churches
of
the
east
had
an
apostle
for
its
founder
andrew
the
first
called
of
the
twelve
hailed
with
his
blessing
long
beforehand
the
destined
introduction
of
christianity
into
our
country
ascending
up
and
penetrating
by
the
dnieper
into
the
deserts
of
scythia
he
planted
the
first
cross
on
the
hills
of
kieff
see
you
said
he
to
his
disciples
these
hills
on
these
hills
shall
shine
the
light
of
divine
grace
there
shall
be
here
a
great
city
and
god
shall
have
in
it
many
churches
to
his
name
such
are
the
words
of
the
holy
nestor
the
monk
and
annalist
of
the
pechersky
monastery
that
point
from
whence
christian
russia
has
sprung
but
it
was
only
after
an
interval
of
nine
centuries
that
the
rays
of
divine
light
beamed
upon
russia
from
the
walls
of
byzantium
in
which
city
the
same
apostle
andrew
had
appointed
stachys
to
be
the
first
bishop
and
so
committed
as
it
were
to
him
and
to
his
successors
in
the
spirit
of
prescience
the
charge
of
that
wide
region
in
which
he
had
himself
preached
christ
hence
the
indissoluble
connection
of
the
russian
with
the
greek
church
and
the
dependence
of
her
metropolitans
during
six
centuries
upon
the
patriarchal
throne
of
constantinople
until
with
its
consent
she
obtained
her
own
equality
and
independence
in
that
which
was
accorded
to
her
native
primates
the
bulgarians
of
the
danube
the
moravians
and
the
slavonians
of
illyria
had
been
already
enlightened
by
holy
baptism
about
the
middle
of
the
ninth
century

the
reign
of

greek
emperor

learned
greek

translated
into

books
used
in
divine
service
and
according
to
some
accounts
even
the
whole
bible
this
translation
of
the
word
of
god
became
afterward
a
most
blessed
instrument
for
the
conversion
of
the
russians
for
the
missionaries

by
it
enabled
to
expound
the
truths
of
the
gospel
to
the
heathens
in

so

princes
of
kieff
and
the
companions
of

were
the

of

russians
who
embraced

in
the
year
they
made
their
appearance
in
armed
vessels
before
the
walls
of
constantinople
when
the
emperor
was
absent
and
threw
the
greek
capital
into
no
little

and
confusion
tradition
reports
that
the
patriarch
photius
took
the
virginal
robe
of
the
mother
of
god
from
the
blachern
church
and
plunged
it
beneath

waves
of
the

the

boiled
up
from
underneath

memorial
of

triumph

the

in
the
daily
for
that
was
indeed
the
first
hour
of
salvation
to
the
land
of
russia
it
is
probable
that
on
their
return
to
their
own
country
the
princes
of
kieff
sowed
there
the
seeds
of
christianity
for
eighty
years
afterward
on
occasion
of
a
conference
for
peace
between
the
prince
igor
and
certain
byzantine
ambassadors
we
find
mention
already
of
a
church
of
the
prophet
elias
in
kieff
where
the
christian
varangians
swore
to
the
observance
of
the
treaty
constantine
porphyrogenitus
and
other
greek
annalists
even
relate
that
in
the
lifetime
of
oskold
there
was
a
bishop
sent
to
the
russians
by
the
emperor
basil
the
macedonian
and
the
patriarch
ignatius
and
that
he
made
many
converts
chiefly
in
consequence
of
the
miraculous
preservation
of
a
volume
of
the
gospels
which
was
thrown
publicly
into
the
flames
and
taken
out
after
some
time
unconsumed
also
in
condinus
of
sees
subject
to
the
patriarch
of
the
metropolitical
see
of
russia
appears
as
early
as
the
year
lastly
it
is
certain
that
many
of
the
varangians
who
served
in
the
imperial
bodyguard
were
christians
and
that
the
greek
sovereigns
never
lost
sight
of
any
opportunity
of
converting
them
to
their
own
faith
by
which
they
hoped
to
soften
their
savage
manners
when
the
emperor
leo
was
concluding
a
peace
with
oleg
he
showed
not
only
his
own
treasures
to
the
ambassadors
of
the
russian
prince
but
also
the
splendor
of
the
churches
the
holy
relics
the
precious
and
the
instruments
of
the
passion
of
our
lord
if
by
any
means
they
might
catch
from
them
the
spirit
of
the
faith
some
such
influences
as
these
while
christianity
as
yet
was
only
struggling
for
an
uncertain
existence
at
kieff
produced
in
good
time
their
effect
on
the
wisest
of
the
daughters
of
the
slavonians
the
widowed
princess
olga
who
governed
russia
during
the
minority
of
her
son
sviatoslaf
she
undertook
a
voyage
to
constantinople
for
no
other
end
than
to
obtain
a
knowledge
of
the
true
god
and
there
she
received
baptism
at
the
hands
of
the
patriarch
polyeuctes
the
emperor
constantine
porphyrogenitus
himself
who
admired
her
wisdom
being
her
godfather
nestor
draws
an
affecting
picture
of
the
patriarch
foretelling
to
the
newly
illumined
princess
the
blessings
which
were
to
descend
by
her
means
on
future
generations
of
the
russians
while
olga
now
become
helena
by
baptism
that
she
might
resemble
both
in
name
and
deed
the
mother
of
constantine
the
great
stood
meekly
bowing
down
her
head
and
drinking
in
as
a
sponge
that
is
thirsty
of
moisture
the
instructions
of
the
prelate
concerning
the
canons
of
the
church
fasting
prayer
almsgiving
and
continence
all
which
she
observed
with
exactness
on
her
return
to
her
own
country
although
in
spite
of
all
her
entreaties
the
fierce
and
warlike
prince
sviatoslaf
persisted
in
refusing
to
humble
his
proud
heart
under
the
meek
yoke
of
christ
he
had
still
so
much
affection
for
his
mother
as
not
to
persecute
such
as
agreed
with
her
in
religion
but
even
to
allow
them
freely
to
make
open
profession
of
their
faith
under
the
protection
of
that
princess
he
confided
his
children
to
her
care
during
his
incessant
military
expeditions
and
so
enabled
her
to
confirm
the
saving
impressions
of
christianity
among
the
people
who
respected
her
and
to
instil
them
into
the
mind
of
her
young
grandson
vladimir
for
nothing
sinks
so
deep
into
the
heart
as
the
affectionate
words
of
a
mother
the
princess
had
with
her
a
priest
named
gregory
whom
she
had
brought
from
constantinople
and
by
him
she
was
buried
after
her
death
in
the
spot
which
she
had
herself
appointed
without
any
of
the
usual
pagan
ceremonies
the
people
by
whom
she
had
been
surnamed
the
wise
during
life
began
to
bless
her
for
a
saint
after
her
death
when
they
came
themselves
to
follow
the
example
of
this
morning
star
which
had
risen
and
gone
before
to
lead
russia
into
the
path
of
salvation
nowhere
has
christianity
ever
been
less
persecuted
at
its
first
introduction
than
in
our
own
country
the
speaks
of
only
two
christian
martyrs
the
varangians
theodore
and
john
who
were
put
to
death
by
the
fury
of
the
people
because
one
of
them
from
natural
affection
had
refused
to
give
up
his
son
when
he
had
been
devoted
by
the
prince
vladimir
to
be
offered
as
a
sacrifice
to
peroun
probably
the
very
zeal
of
this
prince
for
the
heathen
deities
to
whom
he
set
up
statues
and
multiplied
altars
may
have
inspired
the
neighboring
nations
with
the
desire
of
converting
so
powerful
a
ruler
to
their
respective
creeds
and
thus
his
blind
impulse
toward
the
deity
which
was
unknown
to
him
received
a
true
direction
the
mahometan
bulgarians
were
the
first
to
send
ambassadors
to
him
with
the
offer
of
their
faith
but
the
mercy
of
providence
for
so
it
plainly
was
inspired
him
to
give
them
a
decided
refusal
on
the
ground
that
he
did
not
choose
to
comply
with
some
of
their
regulations
though
else
a
sensual
religion
might
well
have
enticed
a
man
who
was
given
up
to
the
indulgence
of
his
passions
the
chazarian
jews
flattered
themselves
with
the
hope
of
attracting
the
prince
by
boasting
of
their
religion
and
the
ancient
glory
of
jerusalem
but
where
demanded
the
wise
grandson
of
olga
is
your
country
it
is
ruined
by
the
wrath
of
god
for
the
sins
of
our
fathers
was
their
answer
vladimir
then
said
that
he
had
no
mind
to
embrace
the
law
of
a
people
whom
god
had
abandoned
there
came
also
western
doctors
from
germany
who
would
have
persuaded
vladimir
to
embrace
christianity
but
their
christianity
seemed
strange
to
him
for
russia
had
hitherto
no
acquaintance
but
with
byzantium
return
home
he
said
our
ancestors
did
not
receive
this
religion
from
you
a
greek
embassy
had
the
best
success
of
them
all
a
certain
philosopher
a
monk
named
constantine
after
having
exposed
the
insufficiency
of
other
religions
eloquently
set
before
the
prince
those
judgments
of
god
which
are
in
the
world
the
redemption
of
the
human
race
by
the
blood
of
christ
and
the
retribution
of
the
life
to
come
his
discourse
powerfully
affected
the
heathen
monarch
who
was
burdened
with
the
heavy
sins
of
a
tumultuous
youth
and
this
was
particularly
the
case
when
the
monk
pointed
out
to
him
on
an
icon
which
represented
the
last
judgment
the
different
lot
of
the
just
and
of
the
wicked
good
to
these
on
the
right
hand
but
woe
to
those
on
the
left
exclaimed
vladimir
deeply
affected
but
sensual
nature
still
struggled
in
him
against
heavenly
truth
having
dismissed
the
missionary
or
ambassador
with
presents
he
still
hesitated
to
decide
and
wished
first
to
examine
further
concerning
the
faith
in
concert
with
the
elders
of
his
council
that
all
russia
might
have
a
share
in
his
conversion
the
council
of
the
prince
decided
to
send
chosen
men
to
make
their
observations
on
each
religion
on
the
spot
where
it
was
professed
and
this
public
agreement
explains
in
some
degree
the
sudden
and
general
acceptance
of
christianity
which
shortly
after
followed
in
russia
it
is
probable
that
not
only
the
chiefs
but
the
common
people
also
were
expecting
and
ready
for
the
change
the
greek
emperors
did
not
fail
to
profit
by
this
favorable
opportunity
and
the
patriarch
himself
in
person
celebrated
the
divine
liturgy
in
the
church
of
sophia
with
the
utmost
possible
magnificence
before
the
astonished
ambassadors
of
vladimir
the
sublimity
and
splendor
of
the
service
struck
them
but
we
do
not
ascribe
to
the
mere
external
impression
that
softening
of
the
hearts
of
these
heathens
on
which
depended
the
conversion
of
a
whole
nation
from
the
very
earliest
times
of
the
church
extraordinary
signs
of
god
power
have
constantly
gone
with
that
apparent
weakness
of
man
by
which
the
gospel
was
preached
and
so
also
the
relates
of
the
russian
ambassadors
that
during
the
divine
liturgy
at
the
time
of
carrying
the
holy
gifts
in
procession
to
the
throne
or
altar
and
singing
the
cherubic
hymn
the
eyes
of
their
spirits
were
opened
and
they
saw
as
in
an
ecstasy
glittering
youths
who
joined
in
singing
the
hymn
of
the
holy
being
thus
fully
persuaded
of
the
truth
of
the
orthodox
faith
they
returned
to
their
own
country
already
christians
in
heart
and
without
saying
a
word
before
the
prince
in
favor
of
the
other
religions
they
declared
thus
concerning
the
greek
when
we
stood
in
the
temple
we
did
not
know
where
we
were
for
there
is
nothing
else
like
it
upon
earth
there
in
truth
god
has
his
dwelling
with
men
and
we
can
never
forget
the
beauty
we
saw
there
no
one
who
has
once
tasted
sweets
will
afterward
take
that
which
is
bitter
nor
can
we
now
any
longer
abide
in
heathenism
then
the
said
to
vladimir
if
the
religion
of
the
greeks
had
not
been
good
your
grandmother
olga
who
was
the
wisest
of
women
would
not
have
embraced
it
the
weight
of
the
name
of
olga
decided
her
grandson
and
he
said
no
more
in
answer
than
these
words
where
shall
we
be
baptized
but
vladimir
led
by
a
sense
which
had
not
yet
been
purged
by
greece
thought
it
best
to
follow
the
custom
of
his
ancestors
who
made
warlike
descents
upon
constantinople
and
so
win
to
himself
sword
in
hand
his
new
religion
he
embarked
his
warriors
on
board
their
vessels
and
attacked
cherson
in
the
taurid
a
city
which
was
subject
to
the
emperors
basil
and
constantine
after
a
long
and
unsuccessful
siege
a
certain
priest
named
anastasius
by
means
of
an
arrow
shot
from
the
town
informed
the
prince
that
the
fate
of
the
besieged
depended
upon
his
cutting
off
the
aqueducts
which
supplied
them
with
water
vladimir
in
great
joy
made
a
vow
that
he
would
be
baptized
if
he
gained
possession
of
the
town
and
he
did
gain
possession
of
it
then
he
sent
to
constantinople
to
demand
from
the
greek
emperor
the
hand
of
their
sister
anna
and
they
in
answer
proposed
as
a
condition
that
he
should
embrace
christianity
for
though
they
themselves
desired
an
alliance
with
so
powerful
a
prince
they
at
the
same
time
took
care
to
follow
the
prudent
and
pious
policy
of
their
predecessors
who
had
ever
sought
to
bring
their
fierce
neighbors
under
the
humanizing
influence
of
the
faith
the
prince
declared
his
consent
because
in
his
own
words
he
had
long
since
examined
and
conceived
a
love
for
the
greek
law
it
was
her
faith
alone
which
influenced
the
princess
to
sacrifice
herself
at
once
for
the
temporal
interests
of
her
own
country
and
for
the
eternal
welfare
of
a
strange
people
accompanied
by
a
venerable
body
of
clergy
she
sailed
for
cherson
and
on
her
arrival
induced
the
prince
to
hasten
his
baptism
for
it
was
so
ordered
says
the
pious
annalist
by
the
wisdom
of
god
that
the
sight
of
the
prince
was
at
that
time
much
affected
by
a
complaint
of
the
eyes
but
at
the
moment
that
the
bishop
of
cherson
laid
his
hands
upon
him
when
he
had
risen
up
out
of
the
bath
of
regeneration
vladimir
suddenly
received
not
only
spiritual
illumination
but
also
the
bodily
sight
of
his
eyes
and
cried
out
i
have
seen
the
true
god
many
of
the
prince
suite
were
so
struck
by
his
miraculous
recovery
that
they
followed
his
example
and
were
baptized
in
like
manner
and
these
were
doubtless
afterward
zealous
for
the
introduction
of
christianity
into
their
country
the
baptism
and
marriage
of
vladimir
were
both
celebrated
in
the
church
of
the
most
holy
mother
of
god
and
hence
no
doubt
arose
his
peculiar
zeal
for
the
most
pure
virgin
to
whose
honor
he
afterward
erected
a
cathedral
church
in
his
own
city
of
kieff
in
cherson
itself
he
built
a
church
in
the
name
of
his
angel
or
patron
st
basil
and
taking
with
him
the
relics
of
clement
bishop
of
rome
and
his
disciple
thebas
with
church
vessels
and
ornaments
and
icons
he
restored
the
city
to
be
again
under
the
power
of
the
emperors
and
returned
to
kieff
accompanied
by
the
princess
their
daughter
and
her
greek
ecclesiastics
nestor
makes
no
mention
of
any
of
the
bishops
and
priests
from
constantinople
and
cherson
who
followed
in
the
train
of
the
prince
excepting
only
of
one
anastasius
the
priest
who
had
rendered
him
such
good
service
during
the
siege
but
the
of
the
give
the
name
of
michael
a
syrian
by
birth
and
of
six
other
bishops
who
were
sent
together
with
him
to
cherson
by
the
patriarch
nicholas
chrysoberges
some
have
ventured
to
suppose
that
michael
was
the
name
of
the
bishop
of
the
times
of
oskold
but
nestor
says
nothing
about
him
and
this
much
only
is
certain
that
he
stands
the
first
in
the
list
of
the
metropolitans
of
russia
after
his
return
to
kieff
the
great
prince
caused
his
twelve
sons
to
be
baptized
and
proceeded
to
destroy
the
monuments
of
heathenism
he
ordered
peroun
to
be
thrown
into
the
dnieper
the
people
at
first
followed
their
idol
as
it
was
borne
down
the
stream
but
were
soon
quieted
when
they
saw
that
the
statue
had
no
power
to
help
itself
and
now
vladimir
being
surrounded
and
supported
by
believers
in
his
own
domestic
circle
and
encouraged
by
seeing
that
his
boyars
and
suite
were
prepared
and
ready
to
embrace
the
faith
made
a
proclamation
to
the
people
that
whoever
on
the
morrow
should
not
repair
to
the
river
whether
rich
or
poor
he
should
hold
him
for
his
enemy
at
the
call
of
their
respected
lord
all
the
multitude
of
the
citizens
in
troops
with
their
wives
and
children
flocked
to
the
dnieper
and
without
any
manner
of
opposition
received
holy
baptism
as
a
nation
from
the
greek
bishops
and
priests
nestor
draws
a
touching
picture
of
this
baptism
of
a
whole
people
at
once
some
stood
in
the
water
up
to
their
necks
others
up
to
their
breasts
holding
their
young
children
in
their
arms
the
priests
read
the
prayers
from
the
shore
naming
at
once
whole
companies
by
the
same
name
he
who
was
the
means
of
thus
bringing
them
to
salvation
filled
with
a
transport
of
joy
at
the
affecting
sight
cried
out
to
the
lord
offering
and
commending
into
his
hands
himself
and
his
people
o
great
god
who
hast
made
heaven
and
earth
look
down
upon
these
thy
new
people
grant
them
o
lord
to
know
thee
the
true
god
as
thou
hast
been
made
known
to
christian
lands
and
confirm
in
them
a
true
and
unfailing
faith
and
assist
me
o
lord
against
my
enemy
that
opposes
me
that
trusting
in
thee
and
in
thy
power
i
may
overcome
all
his
wiles
vladimir
erected
the
first
church
that
of
st
basil
after
whom
he
was
named
on
the
very
mount
which
had
formerly
been
sacred
to
peroun
adjoining
his
own
palace
thus
was
russia
enlightened
so
sudden
and
ready
a
conversion
of
the
inhabitants
of
kieff
might
well
seem
improbable
that
is
unless
effected
by
violence
did
we
not
attend
to
the
fact
that
the
russians
had
been
gradually
becoming
enlightened
ever
since
the
times
of
oskold
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
by
means
of
commerce
treaties
of
peace
and
relations
of
every
kind
with
the
greeks
as
well
as
with
the
bulgarians
and
slavonians
of
kindred
origin
with
ourselves
who
had
already
been
long
in
possession
of
the
holy
scriptures
in
their
own
language
the
constant
endeavors
of
the
greek
emperors
for
the
conversion
of
the
russians
by
means
of
their
ambassadors
and
preachers
the
tolerance
of
the
princes
the
example
and
protection
of
olga
and
the
very
delay
and
hesitation
of
vladimir
in
selecting
his
religion
must
have
favorably
disposed
the
minds
of
the
people
toward
it
especially
if
it
be
true
as
has
been
asserted
that
russia
had
already
had
a
bishop
in
the
time
of
oskold
in
a
similar
way
though
under
different
circumstances
in
the
vast
roman
empire
the
conversion
of
constantine
the
great
suddenly
rendered
christianity
the
dominant
religion
because
in
fact
it
had
long
before
penetrated
among
all
ranks
of
his
subjects
vladimir
engaged
zealously
in
building
churches
throughout
the
towns
and
villages
of
his
dominions
and
sent
priests
to
preach
in
them
he
also
founded
many
towns
all
around
kieff
and
so
propagated
and
confirmed
the
christian
religion
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
capital
from
whence
the
new
colonies
were
sent
forth
neither
was
he
slow
in
establishing
schools
into
which
he
brought
together
the
children
of
the
boyars
sometimes
even
in
spite
of
the
unwillingness
of
their
rude
parents
in
the
mean
time
the
metropolitan
with
his
bishops
made
progresses
into
the
interior
of
russia
to
the
cities
of
rostoff
and
novgorod
everywhere
baptizing
and
instructing
the
people
vladimir
himself
for
the
same
good
end
went
in
company
with
other
bishops
to
the
district
of
souzdal
and
to
volhynia
the
boyars
on
the
volga
and
some
of
the
pechenegian
princes
embraced
the
gospel
of
salvation
together
with
his
subjects
and
rejoiced
to
be
admitted
to
holy
baptism
the
pious
prince
wished
to
see
in
his
own
capital
a
magnificent
temple
in
honor
of
the
birth
of
the
most
holy
virgin
to
be
a
likeness
and
memorial
of
that
at
cherson
in
which
he
himself
had
been
baptized
and
the
year
after
his
conversion
he
sent
to
greece
for
builders
and
laid
the
foundation
of
the
first
stone
cathedral
in
russia
on
the
very
same
spot
where
the
varangian
martyrs
had
suffered
but
the
first
metropolitan
was
not
to
live
to
its
completion
only
his
holy
remains
were
buried
in
it
and
were
thence
translated
afterward
to
the
pechersky
lavra
another
metropolitan
leontius
a
greek
by
birth
sent
by
the
same
patriarch
nicholas
consecrated
the
new
temple
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
vladimir
who
made
a
vow
to
endow
it
with
the
tenth
part
of
all
his
revenues
and
from
hence
it
was
called
the
cathedral
of
the
tithes
these
tithes
according
to
the
ordinance
ascribed
to
prince
vladimir
consisted
of
the
fixed
quota
of
corn
cattle
and
the
profits
of
trade
for
the
support
of
the
clergy
and
the
poor
and
besides
this
there
was
a
further
tithe
collected
from
every
cause
which
was
tried
for
the
right
of
judging
causes
was
granted
to
the
bishops
and
the
metropolitan
and
they
judged
according
to
the
nomocanon
the
canons
of
the
holy
councils
and
the
greek
ecclesiastical
laws
together
with
the
holy
scriptures
were
taken
from
the
very
first
as
the
basis
of
all
ecclesiastical
administration
in
russia
and
together
with
them
there
came
into
use
some
portions
also
of
the
civil
law
of
the
greeks
through
the
influence
of
the
church
the
care
of
the
new
temple
and
the
collection
of
tithes
for
its
support
were
intrusted
to
a
native
of
cherson
named
anastasius
who
enjoyed
the
confidence
of
vladimir
and
his
successors
the
light
of
christianity
had
now
been
diffused
throughout
the
whole
of
russia
but
still
the
faith
was
nowhere
as
yet
firmly
established
because
there
were
no
bishops
regularly
settled
in
the
towns
the
metropolitan
leontius
formed
the
first
five
dioceses
and
appointed
joachim
of
cherson
to
be
bishop
of
novgorod
theodorus
of
rostoff
neophytus
of
chernigoff
stephen
the
volhynian
of
vladimir
and
nicetas
of
belgorod
assisted
by
dobrina
the
uncle
of
the
great
prince
who
had
long
governed
in
novgorod
the
new
bishop
joachim
threw
the
statue
of
peroun
into
the
volkoff
and
broke
down
the
idolatrous
altars
without
any
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
citizens
for
they
too
like
the
inhabitants
of
kieff
from
their
comparative
degree
of
civilization
and
from
their
relations
of
intercourse
with
the
greeks
were
in
all
probability
already
favorably
disposed
for
the
reception
of
christianity
tradition
asserts
that
even
as
far
back
as
the
time
of
olga
the
hermits
sergius
and
germanus
lived
upon
the
desolate
island
of
balaam
in
the
lake
ladoga
and
that
from
thence
abramius
went
forth
to
preach
christ
to
the
savage
inhabitants
of
rostoff
the
attempt
to
found
a
diocese
at
rostoff
was
less
successful
the
first
two
bishops
theodore
and
hilarion
were
driven
away
by
the
fierce
tribes
of
the
forest
district
of
meri
who
held
obstinately
to
their
idols
in
spite
of
the
zeal
of
abramius
it
cost
the
two
succeeding
bishops
leontius
and
isaiah
many
years
of
extraordinary
labor
and
exertion
attended
frequently
by
persecutions
before
they
at
length
succeeded
in
establishing
christianity
in
that
savage
region
from
whence
it
spread
itself
by
degrees
into
all
the
surrounding
districts
thus
vladimir
having
piously
observed
the
commandments
of
christ
during
the
course
of
his
long
reign
had
the
consolation
of
seeing
before
his
death
the
fruits
of
his
own
conversion
in
all
the
wide
extent
of
his
dominions
he
departed
this
life
in
peace
at
kieff
and
was
soon
reckoned
with
his
grandmother
olga
among
the
guardian
saints
of
russia
john
the
third
metropolitan
who
had
been
sent
from
constantinople
upon
the
death
of
leontius
buried
the
prince
in
the
church
of
the
tithes
which
he
had
built
near
the
tomb
of
the
grecian
princess
his
wife
and
the
uncorrupted
relics
of
olga
were
translated
to

no

regarded

as

to

time
of

it
is
considered
however
to
be
pretty
certain
that
at
the
end
of
the
tenth
century
or
at
the
beginning
of
the
eleventh
the
northmen
reached
the
shores
of

known
they
settled

and

went

either

by

some
of

it

may
have
reached

and
thence
sailed
down
until
they
came
to
the

which
they
named

from
there
they
sent

glowing
accounts
to
their
countrymen
in

northern
lands
who
came
in
larger
numbers
to
join
them
in

about
the

of

great
interest
among
students
of
this
subject
was
aroused
by

written
by

in

the

of
this

of

to

were
convincingly
set
forth
in

the

sagas
written
in

fourteenth
century
and
containing
the
original
accounts
of
the

voyages
to

were
first
brought
prominently
before
modern
scholars
although
many
other
writings
on
the
voyages
have
since
appeared
the
great
work
of
rafn
still
holds
its
place
of
authority
very
little
in
the
way
of
new
material
having
been
brought
to
light
the
portion
of
his
narrative
which
follows
covers
the
main
facts
of
the
history
and
the
translation
from
the
saga
furnishes
an
excellent
example
of
its
quaint
and
simple
narration
charles
rafn
eric
the
red
in
the
spring
of
emigrated
from
iceland
to
greenland
formed
a
settlement
there
and
fixed
his
residence
at
brattalid
in
ericsfiord
among
others
who
accompanied
him
was
heriulf
bardson
who
established
himself
at
heriulfsnes
biarne
the
son
of
the
latter
was
at
that
time
absent
on
a
trading
voyage
to
norway
but
in
the
course
of
the
summer
returning
to
eyrar
in
iceland
and
finding
that
his
father
had
taken
his
departure
this
bold
navigator
resolved
still
to
spend
the
following
winter
like
all
the
preceding
ones
with
his
father
although
neither
he
nor
any
of
his
people
had
ever
navigated
the
greenland
sea
they
set
sail
but
met
with
northerly
winds
and
fogs
and
after
many
days
sailing
knew
not
whither
they
had
been
carried
at
length
when
the
weather
again
cleared
up
they
saw
a
land
which
was
without
mountains
overgrown
with
wood
and
having
many
gentle
elevations
as
this
land
did
not
correspond
to
the
descriptions
of
greenland
they
left
it
on
the
larboard
hand
and
continued
sailing
two
days
when
they
saw
another
land
which
was
flat
and
overgrown
with
wood
from
thence
they
stood
out
to
sea
and
sailed
three
days
with
a
southwest
wind
when
they
saw
a
third
land
which
was
high
and
mountainous
and
covered
with
icebergs
glaciers
they
coasted
along
the
shore
and
saw
that
it
was
an
island
they
did
not
go
on
shore
as
biarne
did
not
find
the
country
to
be
inviting
bearing
away
from
this
island
they
stood
out
to
sea
with
the
same
wind
and
after
four
days
sailing
with
fresh
gales
they
reached
heriulfsnes
in
greenland
some
time
after
this
probably
in
the
year
biarne
paid
a
visit
to
eric
earl
of
norway
and
told
him
of
his
voyage
and
of
the
unknown
lands
he
had
discovered
he
was
blamed
by
many
for
not
having
examined
these
countries
more
accurately
on
his
return
to
greenland
there
was
much
talk
about
undertaking
a
voyage
of
discovery
leif
a
son
of
eric
the
red
bought
biarne
ship
and
equipped
it
with
a
crew
of
men
among
whom
was
a
german
of
the
name
of
tyrker
who
had
long
resided
with
his
father
and
who
had
been
very
fond
of
leif
in
his
childhood
in
the
year
they
commenced
the
projected
voyage
and
came
first
to
the
land
which
biarne
had
seen
last
they
cast
anchor
and
went
on
shore
no
grass
was
seen
but
everywhere
in
this
country
were
vast
ice
mountains
glaciers
and
the
intermediate
space
between
these
and
the
shore
was
as
it
were
one
uniform
plain
of
slate
the
country
appearing
to
them
destitute
of
good
qualities
they
called
it
they
put
out
to
sea
and
came
to
another
land
where
they
also
went
on
shore
the
country
was
very
level
and
covered
with
woods
and
wheresoever
they
went
there
were
cliffs
of
white
sand
and
a
low
coast
they
called
the
country
mark
land
woodland
from
thence
they
again
stood
out
to
sea
with
a
northeast
wind
and
continued
sailing
for
two
days
before
they
made
land
again
they
then
came
to
an
island
which
lay
to
the
eastward
of
the
mainland
they
sailed
westward
in
waters
where
there
was
much
ground
left
dry
at
ebb
tide
afterward
they
went
on
shore
at
a
place
where
a
river
issuing
from
a
lake
fell
into
the
sea
they
brought
their
ship
into
the
river
and
from
thence
into
the
lake
where
they
cast
anchor
here
they
constructed
some
temporary
log
huts
but
later
when
they
had
made
up
their
mind
to
winter
there
they
built
large
houses
afterward
called
when
the
buildings
were
completed
leif
divided
his
people
into
two
companies
who
were
by
turns
employed
in
keeping
watch
at
the
houses
and
in
making
small
excursions
for
the
purpose
of
exploring
the
country
in
the
vicinity
his
instructions
to
them
were
that
they
should
not
go
to
a
greater
distance
than
that
they
might
return
in
the
course
of
the
same
evening
and
that
they
should
not
separate
from
one
another
leif
took
his
turn
also
joining
the
exploring
party
the
one
day
and
remaining
at
the
houses
the
other
it
so
happened
that
one
day
the
german
tyrker
was
missing
leif
accordingly
went
out
with
twelve
men
in
search
of
him
but
they
had
not
gone
far
from
their
houses
when
they
met
him
coming
toward
them
when
leif
inquired
why
he
had
been
so
long
absent
he
at
first
answered
in
german
but
they
did
not
understand
what
he
said
he
then
said
to
them
in
the
norse
tongue
i
did
not
go
much
farther
yet
i
have
a
discovery
to
acquaint
you
with
i
have
found
vines
and
grapes
he
added
by
way
of
confirmation
that
he
had
been
born
in
a
country
where
there
were
plenty
of
vines
they
had
now
two
occupations
namely
to
hew
timber
for
loading
the
ship
and
collect
grapes
with
these
last
they
filled
the
ship
longboat
leif
gave
a
name
to
the
country
and
called
it
vinland
vineland
in
the
spring
they
sailed
again
from
thence
and
returned
to
greenland
leif
vineland
voyage
was
now
a
subject
of
frequent
conversation
in
greenland
and
his
brother
thorwald
was
of
opinion
that
the
country
had
not
been
sufficiently
explored
he
accordingly
borrowed
leif
ship
and
aided
by
his
brother
counsel
and
directions
commenced
a
voyage
in
the
year
he
arrived
at
in
vineland
where
they
spent
the
winter
he
and
his
crew
employing
themselves
in
fishing
in
the
spring
of
thorwald
sent
a
party
in
the
ship
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
southward
they
found
the
country
beautiful
and
well
wooded
with
but
little
space
between
the
woods
and
the
sea
there
were
likewise
extensive
ranges
of
white
sand
and
many
islands
and
shallows
they
found
no
traces
of
men
having
been
there
before
them
excepting
on
an
island
lying
to
westward
where
they
found
a
wooden
shed
they
did
not
return
to
until
the
fall
in
the
following
summer
thorwald
sailed
eastward
with
the
large
ship
and
then
northward
past
a
remarkable
headland
enclosing
a
bay
and
which
was
opposite
to
another
headland
they
called
it
keel
cape
from
thence
they
sailed
along
the
eastern
coast
of
the
land
into
the
nearest
firths
to
a
promontory
which
there
projected
and
which
was
everywhere
overgrown
with
wood
there
thorwald
went
ashore
with
all
his
companions
he
was
so
pleased
with
this
place
that
he
exclaimed
this
is
beautiful
and
here
i
should
like
well
to
fix
my
dwelling
afterward
when
they
were
preparing
to
go
on
board
they
observed
on
the
sandy
beach
within
the
promontory
three
hillocks
and
repairing
hither
they
found
three
canoes
under
each
of
which
were
three
skrellings
esquimaux
they
came
to
blows
with
the
latter
and
killed
eight
but
the
ninth
escaped
with
his
canoe
afterward
a
countless
number
issued
forth
against
them
from
the
interior
of
the
bay
they
endeavored
to
protect
themselves
by
raising
on
the
ship
side
the
skrellings
continued
shooting
at
them
for
a
while
and
then
retired
thorwald
was
wounded
by
an
arrow
under
the
arm
and
finding
that
the
wound
was
mortal
he
said
i
now
advise
you
to
prepare
for
your
departure
as
soon
as
possible
but
me
ye
shall
bring
to
the
promontory
where
i
thought
it
good
to
dwell
it
may
be
that
it
was
a
prophetic
word
that
fell
from
my
mouth
about
my
abiding
there
for
a
season
there
shall
ye
bury
me
and
plant
a
cross
at
my
head
and
another
at
my
feet
and
call
the
place
crossness
in
all
time
coming
he
died
and
they
did
as
he
had
ordered
afterward
they
returned
to
their
companions
at
and
spent
the
winter
there
but
in
the
spring
of
they
sailed
again
to
greenland
having
important
intelligence
to
communicate
to
leif
thorstein
eric
third
son
had
resolved
to
proceed
to
to
fetch
his
brother
body
he
fitted
out
the
same
ship
and
selected
strong
and
men
for
his
crew
his
wife
gudrida
also
went
along
with
him
they
were
tossed
about
the
ocean
during
the
whole
summer
and
knew
not
whither
they
were
driven
but
at
the
close
of
the
first
week
of
winter
they
landed
at
lysufiord
in
the
western
settlement
of
greenland
there
thorstein
died
during
the
winter
and
in
the
spring

among
the
islands
he
said
to
them
that
it
was
his
intention
to
go
in
search
of
that
land
which
gunnbiorn
son
of
ulf
the
crow
saw
when
he
was
driven
out
of
his
course
westward
across
the
main
and
discovered
he
told

that
he
would
return

to

finding
that
country
thorbiorn
and
eyiolf
and
styr
accompanied
eric
out
beyond
the
islands
and
they
parted
with
the
greatest
friendliness
eric
said
to
them
that
he
would
render
them
similar
aid
so
far
as
it
might
be
within
his
power
if
they
should
ever
stand
in
need
of
his
help
eric
sailed
out
to
sea
from
and
arrived
at
that
ice
mountain
which
is
called
blacksark
thence
he
sailed
to
the
southward
that
he
might
ascertain
whether
there
was
habitable
country
in
that
direction
he
passed
the
first
winter
at
ericsey
near
the
middle
of
the
western
settlement
in
the
following
spring
he
proceeded
to
ericsfirth
and
selected
a
site
there
for
his
homestead
that
summer
he
explored
the
western
uninhabited
region
remaining
there
for
a
long
time
and
assigning
many
local
names
there
the
second
winter
he
spent
at
ericsholms
beyond
hvarfsgnipa
but
the
third
summer
he
sailed
northward
to
snaefell
and
into
hrafnsfirth
he
believed
then
that
he
had
reached
the
head
of
ericsfirth
he
turned
back
then
and
remained
the
third
winter
at
ericsey
at
the
mouth
of
ericsfirth
the
following
summer
he
sailed
to
iceland
and
landed
in
breidafirth
he
remained
that
winter
with
ingolf
at
holmlatr
in
the
spring
he
and
thorgest
fought
together
and
eric
was
defeated
after
this
a
reconciliation
was
effected
between
them
that
summer
eric
set
out
to
colonize
the
land
which
he
had
discovered
and
which
he
called
greenland
because
he
said
men
would
be
the
more
readily
persuaded
thither
if
the
land
had
a
good
name
eric
was
married
to
a
woman
named
thorhild
and
had
two
sons
one
of
these
was
named
thorstein
and
the
other
leif
they
were
both
promising
men
thorstein
lived
at
home
with
his
father
and
there
was
not
at
that
time
a
man
in
greenland
who
was
accounted
of
so
great
promise
as
he
leif
had
sailed
to
norway
where
he
was
at
the
court
of
king
olaf
tryggvason
when
leif
sailed
from
greenland
in
the
summer
they
were
driven
out
of
their
course
to
the
hebrides
it
was
late
before
they
got
fair
winds
thence
and
they
remained
there
far
into
the
summer
leif
became
enamoured
of
a
certain
woman
whose
name
was
thorgunna
she
was
a
woman
of
fine
family
and
leif
observed
that
she
was
possessed
of
rare
intelligence
when
leif
was
preparing
for
his
departure
thorgunna
asked
to
be
permitted
to
accompany
him
leif
inquired
whether
she
had
in
this
the
approval
of
her
kinsmen
she
replied
that
she
did
not
care
for
it
leif
responded
that
he
did
not
deem
it
the
part
of
wisdom
to
abduct
so
a
woman
in
a
strange
country
and
we
so
few
in
number
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
thou
shalt
find
this
to
be
the
better
decision
said
thorgunna
i
shall
put
it
to
the
proof
notwithstanding
said
leif
then
i
tell
thee
said
thorgunna
that
i
foresee
that
i
shall
give
birth
to
a
male
child
and
though
thou
give
this
no
heed
yet
will
i
rear
the
boy
and
send
him
to
thee
in
greenland
when
he
shall
be
fit
to
take
his
place
with
other
men
and
i
foresee
that
thou
will
get
as
much
profit
of
this
son
as
is
thy
due
from
this
our
parting
moreover
i
mean
to
come
to
greenland
myself
before
the
end
comes
leif
gave
her
a
gold
a
greenland
wadmal
mantle
and
a
belt
of
walrus
tusk
this
boy
came
to
greenland
and
was
called
thorgils
leif
acknowledged
his
paternity
and
some
men
will
have
it
that
this
thorgils
came
to
iceland
in
the
summer
before
the
however
this
thorgils
was
afterward
in
greenland
and
there
seemed
to
be
something
not
altogether
natural
about
him
before
the
end
came
leif
and
his
companions
sailed
away
from
the
hebrides
and
arrived
in
norway
in
the
autumn
leif
went
to
the
court
of
king
olaf
tryggvason
he
was
well
received
by
the
king
who
felt
that
he
could
see
that
leif
was
a
man
of
great
accomplishments
upon
one
occasion
the
king
came
to
speech
with
leif
and
asked
him
is
it
thy
purpose
to
sail
to
greenland
in
the
summer
it
is
my
purpose
said
leif
if
it
be
your
will
i
believe
it
will
be
well
answered
the
king
and
thither
thou
shalt
go
upon
my
errand
to
proclaim
christianity
there
leif
replied
that
the
king
should
decide
but
gave
it
as
his
belief
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
carry
this
mission
to
a
successful
issue
in
greenland
the
king
replied
that
he
knew
of
no
man
who
would
be
better
fitted
for
this
undertaking
and
in
thy
hands
the
cause
will
surely
prosper
this
can
only
be
said
leif
if
i
enjoy
the
grace
of
your
protection
leif
put
to
sea
when
his
ship
was
ready
for
the
voyage
for
a
long
time
he
was
tossed
about
upon
the
ocean
and
came
upon
lands
of
which
he
had
previously
had
no
knowledge
there
were
and
vines
growing
there
there
were
also
those
trees
there
which
are
called
mansur
and
of
all
these
they
took
specimens
some
of
the
timbers
were
so
large
that
they
were
used
in
building
leif
found
men
upon
a
wreck
and
took
them
home
with
him
and
procured
quarters
for
them
all
during
the
winter
in
this
wise
he
showed
his
nobleness
and
goodness
since
he
introduced
christianity
into
the
country
and
saved
the
men
from
the
wreck
and
he
was
called
leif
the
lucky
ever
after
leif
landed
in
ericsfirth
and
then
went
home
to
brattahlid
he
was
well
received
by
everyone
he
soon
proclaimed
christianity
throughout
the
land
and
the
catholic
faith
and
announced
king
olaf
messages
to
the
people
telling
them
how
much
excellence
and
how
great
glory
accompanied
this
faith
eric
was
slow
in
forming
the
determination
to
forsake
his
old
belief
but
thiodhild
embraced
the
faith
promptly
and
caused
a
church
to
be
built
at
some
distance
from
the
house
this
building
was
called
thiodhild
church
and
there
she
and
those
persons
who
had
accepted
christianity
and
there
were
many
were
wont
to
offer
their
prayers
at
this
time
there
began
to
be
much
talk
about
a
voyage
of
exploration
to
that
country
which
leif
had
discovered
the
leader
of
this
expedition
was
thorstein
ericsson
who
was
a
good
man
and
an
intelligent
and
blessed
with
many
friends
eric
was
likewise
invited
to
join
them
for
the
men
believed
that
his
luck
and
foresight
would
be
of
great
furtherance
he
was
slow
in
deciding
but
did
not
say
nay
when
his
friends
besought
him
to
go
they
thereupon
equipped
that
ship
in
which
thorbiorn
had
come
out
and
twenty
men
were
selected
for
the
expedition
they
took
little
cargo
with
them
naught
else
save
their
weapons
and
provisions
on
that
morning
when
eric
set
out
from
his
home
he
took
with
him
a
little
chest
containing
gold
and
silver
he
hid
this
treasure
and
then
went
his
way
he
had
proceeded
but
a
short
distance
however
when
he
fell
from
his
horse
and
broke
his
ribs
and
dislocated
his
shoulder
whereat
he
cried
ai
ai
by
reason
of
this
accident
he
sent
his
wife
word
that
she
should
procure
the
treasure
which
he
had
concealed
for
to
the
hiding
of
the
treasure
he
attributed
his
misfortune
thereafter
they
sailed
cheerily
out
of
ericsfirth
in
high
spirits
over
their
plan
they
were
long
tossed
about
upon
the
ocean
and
could
not
lay
the
course
they
wished
they
came
in
sight
of
iceland
and
likewise
saw
birds
from
the
irish
coast
their
ship
was
in
sooth
driven
hither
and
thither
over
the
sea
in
autumn
they
turned
back
worn
out
by
toil
and
exposure
to
the
elements
and
exhausted
by
their
labors
and
arrived
at
ericsfirth
at
the
very
beginning
of
winter
then
said
eric
more
cheerful
were
we
in
the
summer
when
we
put
out
of
the
firth
but
we
still
live
and
it
might
have
been
much
worse
thorstein
answers
it
will
be
a
princely
deed
to
endeavor
to
look
well
after
the
wants
of
all
these
men
who
are
now
in
need
and
to
make
provision
for
them
during
the
winter
eric
answers
it
is
ever
true
as
it
is
said
that
is
never
clear
ere
the
winter
comes
and
so
it
must
be
here
we
will
act
now
upon
thy
counsel
in
this
matter
all
of
the
men
who
were
not
otherwise
provided
for
accompanied
the
father
and
son
they
landed
thereupon
and
went
home
to
brattahlid
where
they
remained
throughout
the
winter
mahometans
in
india
bloody
invasions
under
mahmud
alexander
dow
while
buddhism
was
giving
place
to
hinduism
in
india
a
new
faith
had
arisen
in
arabia
mahomet
born
created
a
conquering
religion
and
died
in
within
a
hundred
years
after
his
death
his
followers
had
invaded
the
countries
of
asia
as
far
as
the
hindu
kush
here
their
progress
was
stayed
and
islam
had
to
consolidate
itself
during
three
more
centuries
before
it
grew
strong
enough
to
grasp
the
rich
prize
of
india
but
almost
from
the
first
the
arabs
had
fixed
eager
eyes
upon
that
wealthy
empire
and
several
premature
inroads
foretold
the
coming
storm
about
fifteen
years
after
the
death
of
the
prophet
othman
sent
a
naval
expedition
to
thana
and
broach
on
the
bombay
coast
other
raids
toward
sind
took
place
in
and
with
no
lasting
results
hinduism
was
for
a
time
submerged
but
never
drowned
by
the
tide
of
mahometan
conquest
which
set
steadily
toward
india
about
at
the
present
day
the
south
of
india
remains
almost
entirely
hindu
by
far
the
greater
number
of
the
indian
feudatory
chiefs
are
still
under
brahman
influence
but
in
the
northwest
where
the
first
waves
of
invasion
have
always
broken
about
of
the
population
now
profess
islam
the
upper
valley
of
the
ganges
boasts
a
succession
of
mussulman
capitals
and
in
the
swamps
of
lower
bengal
the
bulk
of
the
or
aboriginal
population
have
become
converts
to
the
mahometan
religion
the
mussulmans
now
make
millions
of
the
total
of
two
hundred
and
millions
in
india
the
armies
of
islam
had
carried
the
crescent
throughout
asia
west
of
the
hindu
kush
and
through
africa
and
southern
europe
to
distant
spain
and
france
before
they
obtained
a
foothold
in
the
punjab
the
brilliant
attempt
in
to
found
a
lasting
mahometan
dynasty
in
sind
failed
three
centuries
later
the
utmost
efforts
of
a
series
of
mussulman
invaders
from
the
northwest
only
succeeded
in
annexing
a
small
portion
of
the
frontier
punjab
provinces
the
popular
notion
that
india
fell
an
easy
prey
to
the
mussulmans
is
opposed
to
the
historical
facts
mahometan
rule
in
india
consists
of
a
series
of
invasions
and
partial
conquests
during
eleven
centuries
from
othman
raid
about
to
ahmad
shah
tempest
of
devastation
in
at
no
time
was
islam
triumphant
throughout
all
india
hindu
dynasties
always
ruled
over
a
large
area
the
first
collision
between
hinduism
and
islam
on
the
punjab
frontier
was
the
act
of
the
hindus
in
jaipal
the
hindu
chief
of
lahore
annoyed
by
afghan
raids
led
his
troops
through
the
mountains
against
the
mahometan
kingdom
of
ghazni
in
afghanistan
subuktigin
the
ghaznivide
prince
after
severe
fighting
took
advantage
of
a
hurricane
to
cut
off
the
retreat
of
the
hindus
through
the
pass
he
allowed
them
however
to
return
to
india
on
the
surrender
of
fifty
elephants
and
the
promise
of
one
million
about
in
subuktigin
died
and
was
succeeded
by
his
son
mahmud
of
ghazni
aged
sixteen
this
valiant
monarch
surnamed
the
great
reigned
for
years
and
extended
his
father
little
afghan
kingdom
into
a
great
mahometan
sovereignty
stretching
from
persia
on
the
west
to
far
within
the
punjab
on
the
east
mahmud
was
born
about
the
year
of
the
hegira
or
according
to
some
authorities
and
as
astrologers
say
with
many
happy
omens
expressed
in
the
horoscope
of
his
life
subuktigin
being
asleep
at
the
time
of
his
birth
dreamed
that
he
beheld
a
green
tree
springing
forth
from
his
chimney
which
threw
its
shadow
over
the
face
of
the
earth
and
screened
from
the
storms
of
heaven
the
whole
animal
creation
this
indeed
was
verified
by
the
justice
of
mahmud
for
if
we
can
believe
the
poet
in
his
reign
the
wolf
and
the
sheep
drank
together
at
the
same
brook
when
mahmud
had
settled
his
dispute
with
his
brother
ismail
he
hastened
to
balik
from
whence
he
sent
an
ambassador
to
munsur
emperor
of
bokhara
to
whom
the
family
of
ghazni
still
pretended
to
owe
allegiance
complaining
of
the
indignity
which
he
met
with
in
the
appointment
of
buktusin
to
the
government
of
khorassan
a
country
so
long
in
possession
of
his
father
it
was
returned
to
him
for
answer
that
he
was
already
in
possession
of
the
territories
of
balik
turmuz
and
herat
which
was
part
of
the
empire
and
that
there
was
a
necessity
to
divide
the
favors
of
bokhara
among
her
friends
buktusin
it
was
also
insinuated
had
been
a
faithful
and
good
servant
which
seemed
to
throw
a
reflection
upon
the
family
of
ghazni
who
had
rendered
themselves
independent
in
the
governments
they
held
of
the
royal
house
of
samania
mahmud
not
discouraged
by
this
answer
sent
hasan
jemmavi
with
rich
presents
to
the
court
of
bokhara
and
a
letter
in
the
following
terms
that
he
hoped
the
pure
spring
of
friendship
which
had
flowed
in
the
time
of
his
father
should
not
now
be
polluted
with
the
ashes
of
indignity
nor
mahmud
be
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
divesting
himself
of
that
obedience
which
he
had
hitherto
paid
to
the
imperial
family
of
samania
when
hasan
delivered
his
embassy
his
capacity
and
elocution
appeared
so
great
to
the
emperor
that
desirous
to
gain
him
over
to
his
interest
by
any
means
he
bribed
him
at
last
with
the
honors
of
the
wazirate
but
never
returned
an
answer
to
mahmud
that
prince
having
received
information
of
this
transaction
through
necessity
turned
his
face
toward
nishapur
and
marched
to
murgab
buktusin
in
the
mean
time
treacherously
entered
into
a
confederacy
with
faek
and
forming
a
conspiracy
in
the
camp
of
munsur
seized
upon
the
person
of
that
prince
and
cruelly
put
out
his
eyes
abdul
the
younger
brother
of
munsur
who
was
but
a
boy
was
advanced
by
the
traitors
to
the
throne
being
however
afraid
of
the
resentment
of
mahmud
the
conspirators
hastened
to
merv
whither
they
were
pursued
by
the
king
with
great
expedition
finding
themselves
upon
their
march
hard
pressed
in
the
rear
by
mahmud
they
halted
and
gave
him
battle
but
the
sin
of
ingratitude
had
darkened
the
face
of
their
fortune
so
that
the
breeze
of
victory
blew
upon
the
standards
of
the
king
of
ghazni
faek
carried
off
the
young
king
and
fled
to
bokhara
and
buktusin
was
not
heard
of
for
some
time
but
at
length
he
found
his
way
to
his
fellows
in
iniquity
and
began
to
collect
his
scattered
troops
faek
in
the
mean
time
fell
ill
and
soon
afterward
expired
elak
the
usbek
king
seizing
upon
the
opportunity
offered
him
by
that
event
marched
with
an
army
from
kashgar
to
bokhara
and
deprived
and
his
adherents
of
life
and
empire
at
the
same
time
thus
perished
the
last
of
the
house
of
samania
which
had
reigned
for
the
space
of
one
hundred
and
years
the
emperor
of
ghazni
at
this
juncture
employed
himself
in
settling
the
government
of
the
provinces
of
balik
and
khorassan
the
affairs
of
which
he
regulated
in
such
an
able
manner
that
the
fame
thereof
reached
the
ears
of
the
caliph
of
bagdad
the
illustrious
balla
of
the
noble
house
of
abbas
the
caliph
sent
him
a
rich
dress
of
honor
such
as
he
had
never
before
bestowed
on
any
king
and
dignified
mahmud
with
the
titles
of
the
protector
of
the
state
and
treasurer
of
fortune
in
the
end
of
the
month
zikada
in
the
year
of
the
hegira
mahmud
hastened
from
the
city
of
balak
to
herat
and
from
herat
to
sistan
where
he
defeated
khaliph
the
son
of
achmet
the
governor
of
that
province
of
the
extinguished
family
of
bokhara
and
returned
to
ghazni
he
then
turned
his
face
toward
india
took
many
forts
and
provinces
in
which
having
appointed
his
own
governors
he
returned
to
his
dominions
where
he
spread
the
carpet
of
justice
so
smoothly
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
that
the
love
of
him
and
loyalty
gained
a
place
in
every
heart
having
negotiated
a
treaty
with
elak
the
usbek
the
province
of
was
ceded
to
him
for
which
he
made
an
ample
return
in
presents
of
great
value
and
the
closest
friendship
and
familiarity
for
a
long
time
existed
between
the
kings
mahmud
made
a
vow
to
heaven
that
if
ever
he
should
be
blessed
with
tranquillity
in
his
own
dominions
he
would
turn
his
arms
against
the
idolaters
of
hindustan
he
marched
in
the
year
ad
hegira
from
ghazni
with
ten
thousand
of
his
chosen
horse
and
came
to
peshawur
where
jipal
the
indian
prince
of
lahore
with
twelve
thousand
horse
and
thirty
thousand
foot
supported
by
three
hundred
opposed
him
on
saturday
the
of
the
month
mohirrim
in
the
year
of
the
hegira
an
obstinate
battle
ensued
in
which
the
emperor
was
victorious
jipal
with
fifteen
of
his
principal
officers
was
taken
prisoner
and
five
thousand
of
his
troops
lay
dead
upon
the
field
mahmud
in
this
action
acquired
great
wealth
and
fame
for
round
the
neck
of
jipal
alone
were
found
sixteen
strings
of
jewels
each
of
which
was
valued
at
one
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
rupees
after
this
victory
the
emperor
marched
from
peshawur
and
investing
the
fort
of
batandi
reduced
it
releasing
his
prisoners
upon
the
payment
of
a
large
ransom
and
the
further
stipulation
of
an
annual
tribute
then
returned
to
ghazni
it
was
in
those
days
a
custom
of
the
hindus
that
whatever
rajah
was
twice
defeated
by
the
moslems
should
be
by
that
disgrace
rendered
ineligible
for
further
command
jipal
in
compliance
with
this
custom
having
raised
his
son
to
the
government
ordered
a
funeral
pile
to
be
prepared
upon
which
he
sacrificed
himself
to
his
gods
a
year
later
mahmud
again
marched
into
sistan
and
brought
kaliph
who
had
mismanaged
his
government
prisoner
to
ghazni
finding
that
the
tribute
from
hindustan
had
not
been
paid
in
the
year
he
directed
his
march
toward
the
city
of
battea
and
leaving
the
boundaries
of
multan
arrived
at
tahera
which
was
fortified
with
an
exceeding
high
wall
and
a
deep
broad
ditch
tahera
was
at
that
time
governed
by
a
prince
called
bakhera
who
had
in
the
pride
of
power
and
wealth
greatly
troubled
the
mahometan
governors
whom
mahmud
had
delegated
to
rule
in
hindustan
bakhera
had
also
refused
to
pay
his
proportion
of
the
tribute
to
annandpal
the
son
of
jipal
of
whom
he
held
his
authority
when
mahmud
entered
the
territories
of
bakhera
that
prince
called
out
his
troops
to
receive
him
and
taking
possession
of
a
strong
position
engaged
the
mahometan
army
for
the
space
of
three
days
in
which
time
they
suffered
so
much
that
they
were
on
the
point
of
abandoning
the
attack
but
on
the
fourth
day
mahmud
appeared
at
the
head
of
his
troops
and
addressed
them
at
length
encouraging
them
to
win
glory
he
concluded
by
telling
them
that
this
day
he
had
devoted
himself
to
conquest
or
to
death
bakhera
on
his
part
invoked
the
gods
at
the
temple
and
prepared
with
his
former
resolution
to
repel
the
enemy
the
mahometans
charged
with
their
usual
impetuosity
but
were
repulsed
with
great
slaughter
yet
returning
with
fresh
courage
and
redoubled
rage
the
attack
was
continued
until
the
evening
when
mahmud
turning
his
face
to
the
holy
kaaba
invoked
the
aid
of
the
prophet
in
the
presence
of
his
army
advance
advance
cried
then
the
king
our
prayers
have
found
favor
with
god
immediately
a
great
shout
arose
among
the
host
and
the
moslems
pressing
forward
as
if
they
courted
death
obliged
the
enemy
to
give
ground
and
pursued
them
in
full
retreat
to
the
gates
of
the
city
the
emperor
having
next
morning
invested
the
place
gave
orders
to
make
preparations
for
filling
up
the
ditch
which
task
in
a
few
days
was
nearly
completed
bakhera
finding
he
could
not
long
defend
the
city
determined
to
leave
only
a
small
garrison
for
its
defence
and
accordingly
one
night
he
marched
out
with
the
rest
of
his
troops
and
took
position
in
a
wood
on
the
banks
of
the
indus
mahmud
being
informed
of
his
retreat
detached
part
of
his
army
to
pursue
him
bakhera
by
this
time
was
deserted
by
fortune
and
consequently
by
most
of
his
friends
he
found
himself
surrounded
by
the
mahometans
and
attempted
in
vain
to
force
his
way
through
them
when
just
on
the
point
of
being
taken
prisoner
he
turned
his
sword
against
his
breast
while
the
most
of
his
adherents
were
slaughtered
in
attempting
to
avenge
his
death
mahmud
in
the
mean
time
had
taken
tahera
by
assault
and
found
there
one
hundred
and
twenty
elephants
many
slaves
and
much
plunder
he
annexed
the
town
and
its
dependencies
to
his
own
dominions
and
returned
victorious
to
ghazni
in
the
year
he
formed
the
design
of
reconquering
multan
which
had
revolted
from
his
rule
achmet
lodi
the
regent
of
multan
had
formerly
acknowledged
the
suzerainty
of
mahmud
and
after
him
his
grandson
daud
till
the
expedition
against
bakhera
when
daud
withdrew
his
allegiance
the
king
marched
in
the
beginning
of
the
spring
with
a
great
army
from
ghazni
and
was
met
by
annandpal
the
son
of
jipal
prince
of
lahore
in
the
hills
of
peshawur
whom
he
defeated
and
obliged
to
fly
into
cashmere
annandpal
had
entered
into
an
alliance
with
daud
and
as
there
were
two
passes
only
by
which
the
mahometans
could
enter
multan
annandpal
had
taken
upon
himself
to
secure
that
by
the
way
of
peshawur
which
mahmud
chanced
to
take
the
sultan
returning
from
the
pursuit
entered
multan
by
the
way
of
betanda
which
was
his
first
intention
when
daud
received
intelligence
of
the
fate
of
annandpal
thinking
himself
too
weak
to
keep
the
field
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
fortified
place
and
humbly
solicited
forgiveness
for
his
fault
promising
to
pay
a
large
tribute
and
in
the
future
to
obey
implicitly
the
sultan
command
mahmud
received
him
again
as
a
vassal
and
prepared
to
return
to
ghazni
when
news
was
brought
to
him
from
arsallah
who
commanded
at
herat
that
elak
the
king
of
kashgar
had
invaded
his
realm
with
an
army
the
king
hastened
to
settle
the
affairs
of
hindustan
which
he
put
into
the
hands
of
shokpal
a
hindu
prince
who
had
resided
with
governor
of
peshawur
and
had
turned
mussulman
taking
the
name
of
zab
sais
the
particulars
of
the
war
of
mahmud
with
elak
are
these
it
has
already
been
mentioned
that
an
uncommon
friendship
had
existed
between
this
elak
the
usbek
king
of
kashgar
a
kingdom
in
tartary
and
mahmud
the
emperor
himself
was
married
to
the
daughter
of
elak
but
some
factious
men
about
the
two
courts
by
misrepresentations
of
the
princes
to
one
another
changed
their
former
friendship
to
enmity
when
mahmud
therefore
marched
into
hindustan
and
had
left
the
field
of
khorassan
almost
destitute
of
troops
elak
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
and
resolved
to
appropriate
that
province
to
himself
to
accomplish
his
design
he
ordered
his
sapastagi
with
a
large
force
to
enter
khorassan
and
jaffir
taghi
at
the
same
time
was
appointed
to
command
in
the
territory
of
balak
arsallah
the
governor
of
herat
being
informed
of
these
motions
hastened
to
ghazni
that
he
might
secure
the
capital
in
the
mean
time
the
chiefs
of
khorassan
finding
themselves
deserted
and
being
in
no
condition
to
oppose
the
enemy
submitted
themselves
to
sapastagi
the
general
of
elak
but
mahmud
having
by
great
marches
reached
ghazni
flowed
onward
like
a
torrent
with
his
army
toward
balak
taghi
who
had
by
this
time
possessed
himself
of
the
place
fled
toward
turmuz
at
his
approach
the
emperor
then
detached
arsallah
with
a
great
part
of
his
army
to
drive
sapastagi
out
of
khorassan
and
he
also
upon
the
approach
of
the
troops
of
ghazni
abandoned
herat
and
marched
toward
the
king
of
kashgar
seeing
the
bad
state
of
his
affairs
solicited
the
aid
of
kudar
king
of
chuton
a
province
of
tartary
on
the
confines
of
china
and
that
prince
marched
to
join
him
with
fifty
thousand
horse
strengthened
by
this
alliance
he
crossed
with
the
confederate
armies
the
river
gaon
which
was
five
parasangs
from
balak
and
opposed
himself
to
the
camp
of
mahmud
that
monarch
immediately
drew
up
his
army
in
order
of
battle
giving
the
command
of
the
centre
to
his
brother
the
noble
nasir
supported
by
governor
of
gorgan
and
by
abdallah
a
chief
of
reputation
in
arms
the
right
wing
he
committed
to
the
care
of
alta
sash
an
old
experienced
officer
while
the
left
was
the
charge
of
the
valiant
arsallah
a
chief
of
the
afghans
the
front
of
his
line
he
strengthened
with
five
hundred
with
open
spaces
behind
them
to
facilitate
their
retreat
in
case
of
a
defeat
the
king
of
kashgar
posted
himself
in
the
centre
the
noble
kudir
led
the
right
and
taghi
the
left
the
armies
advanced
to
the
charge
the
shouts
of
warriors
the
neighing
of
horses
and
the
clashing
of
arms
reached
the
broad
arch
of
heaven
while
dust
obscured
the
face
of
day
elak
advancing
with
some
chosen
squadrons
threw
the
centre
of
army
into
disorder
mahmud
perceiving
the
enemy
progress
leaped
from
his
horse
and
kissing
the
ground
invoked
the
aid
of
the
almighty
he
then
mounted
an
encouraged
his
troops
and
made
a
violent
assault
upon
elak
the
elephant
seizing
the
of
the
enemy
folded
his
trunk
around
him
and
tossed
him
aloft
in
the
air
he
then
surged
forward
like
a
mountain
removed
from
its
base
by
an
earthquake
and
trod
the
enemy
under
his
feet
like
locusts
when
the
troops
of
ghazni
saw
their
king
forcing
his
way
alone
through
the
enemy
ranks
they
rushed
forward
with
headlong
impetuosity
and
drove
the
enemy
with
great
slaughter
before
them
elak
abandoned
by
fortune
and
his
army
turned
his
face
to
fly
he
crossed
the
river
with
a
few
of
his
surviving
friends
never
afterward
appearing
in
the
field
to
dispute
the
victory
with
mahmud
the
king
after
this
triumph
marched
two
days
after
the
runaways
on
the
third
night
a
great
storm
of
wind
and
snow
overtook
the
ghaznian
army
in
the
desert
the
king
tents
were
pitched
with
much
difficulty
while
the
army
was
obliged
to
lie
in
the
snow
mahmud
having
ordered
great
fires
to
be
kindled
around
his
tents
they
became
so
warm
that
many
of
the
courtiers
began
to
take
off
their
upper
garments
when
a
facetious
chief
whose
name
was
dalk
came
in
shivering
with
the
cold
at
which
the
king
observing
said
go
out
dalk
and
tell
the
winter
that
he
may
burst
his
cheeks
with
blustering
for
here
we
value
not
his
resentment
dalk
went
out
accordingly
and
returning
in
a
short
time
kissed
the
ground
and
thus
addressed
the
king
i
have
delivered
the
king
message
to
winter
but
the
surly
season
replied
that
if
his
hands
can
not
tear
the
skirts
of
royalty
and
hurt
the
attendants
of
the
king
yet
he
will
so
use
his
power
on
his
army
that
in
the
morning
mahmud
will
be
obliged
to
saddle
his
own
horses
the
king
smiled
at
this
reply
but
it
presently
rendered
him
more
thoughtful
and
he
determined
to
proceed
no
farther
in
the
morning
some
hundreds
of
men
and
horses
were
found
to
have
perished
with
the
cold
mahmud
at
the
same
time
received
advices
from
india
that
zab
sais
the
renegade
hindu
had
thrown
off
his
allegiance
and
returning
to
his
former
religion
expelled
all
the
officers
who
had
been
appointed
by
the
king
from
their
respective
departments
the
king
immediately
determined
to
punish
this
renegade
and
with
great
expedition
advanced
toward
india
he
sent
on
a
part
of
his
cavalry
in
front
which
coming
unexpectedly
upon
zab
sais
defeated
him
and
brought
him
prisoner
to
the
king
the
rebel
was
fined
four
lacs
of
rupees
of
which
mahmud
made
a
present
to
his
treasurer
and
made
zab
sais
a
prisoner
for
life
mahmud
having
thus
settled
his
affairs
in
india
returned
in
autumn
to
ghazni
where
he
remained
for
the
winter
in
peace
but
in
the
spring
of
the
year
annandpal
sovereign
of
lahore
began
to
raise
disturbance
in
multan
so
that
the
king
was
obliged
to
undertake
another
expedition
into
those
parts
with
a
great
army
to
correct
the
indians
annandpal
hearing
of
his
intentions
sent
ambassadors
everywhere
to
request
the
assistance
of
the
other
princes
of
hindustan
who
considered
the
extirpation
of
the
moslems
from
india
as
a
meritorious
and
political
as
well
as
a
religious
action
accordingly
the
princes
of
ugin
gualier
callinger
kannoge
delhi
and
ajmere
entered
into
a
confederacy
and
collecting
their
forces
advanced
toward
the
heads
of
the
indus
with
the
greatest
army
that
had
been
for
some
centuries
seen
upon
the
field
in
india
the
two
armies
came
in
sight
of
one
another
in
a
great
plain
near
the
confines
of
the
province
of
peshawur
they
remained
there
encamped
forty
days
without
action
but
the
troops
of
the
idolaters
daily
increased
in
number
they
were
joined
by
the
gakers
and
other
tribes
with
their
armies
and
surrounded
the
mahometans
who
fearing
a
general
assault
were
obliged
to
intrench
themselves
the
king
having
thus
secured
himself
ordered
a
thousand
archers
to
the
front
to
endeavor
to
provoke
the
enemy
to
advance
to
the
intrenchments
the
archers
accordingly
were
attacked
by
the
gakers
who
notwithstanding
all
the
king
could
do
pursued
the
retreating
bowmen
within
the
trenches
where
a
dreadful
scene
of
carnage
ensued
on
both
sides
in
which
five
thousand
moslems
in
a
few
minutes
were
slain
the
enemy
soldiers
being
now
cut
down
as
fast
as
they
advanced
the
attack
grew
weaker
when
suddenly
the
elephant
which
carried
the
prince
of
lahore
who
was
chief
in
command
took
fright
at
the
report
of
a
gun
and
turned
tail
in
flight
this
circumstance
struck
the
hindus
with
a
panic
for
thinking
they
were
deserted
by
their
general
they
immediately
followed
the
example
abdallah
with
six
thousand
arabian
horse
and
arsallah
with
ten
thousand
turks
afghans
and
chilligis
pursued
the
enemy
for
two
days
and
nights
so
that
twenty
thousand
hindus
were
killed
in
their
flight
in
addition
to
the
great
multitude
that
fell
on
the
field
of
battle
thirty
elephants
with
much
rich
plunder
were
brought
to
the
king
who
to
establish
the
faith
marched
against
the
hindus
of
nagrakot
breaking
down
their
idols
and
destroying
their
temples
there
was
at
that
time
in
the
territory
of
nagrakot
a
strong
fort
called
bima
which
mahmud
invested
after
having
destroyed
the
country
round
about
with
fire
and
sword
bima
was
built
by
a
prince
of
the
same
name
on
the
top
of
a
steep
mountain
and
here
the
hindus
on
account
of
its
strength
had
deposited
the
wealth
consecrated
to
their
idols
in
all
the
neighboring
kingdoms
so
that
in
this
fort
it
was
said
there
was
a
greater
quantity
of
gold
silver
precious
stones
and
pearls
than
ever
had
been
collected
in
the
royal
treasury
of
any
prince
on
earth
mahmud
invested
the
place
with
such
expedition
that
the
hindus
had
not
time
to
send
troops
into
it
for
its
defence
the
greater
part
of
the
garrison
having
been
sent
to
the
field
those
within
consisted
for
the
most
part
of
priests
who
being
adverse
to
the
bloody
business
of
war
in
a
few
days
solicited
permission
to
capitulate
their
request
being
granted
they
opened
the
gates
and
fell
upon
their
faces
before
mahmud
who
with
a
few
of
his
officers
and
attendants
immediately
entered
and
took
possession
of
the
place
in
bima
were
found
seven
hundred
thousand
seven
hundred
maunds
of
gold
and
silver
plate
forty
maunds
of
pure
gold
in
ingots
two
thousand
maunds
of
silver
bullion
and
twenty
maunds
of
various
jewels
set
which
had
been
collecting
from
the
time
of
bima
with
this
immense
treasure
the
king
returned
to
ghazni
and
in
the
year
held
a
magnificent
festival
where
he
displayed
to
the
people
his
wealth
in
golden
thrones
and
in
other
rich
receptacles
in
a
great
plain
without
the
city
of
ghazni
and
after
the
feast
every
individual
received
a
princely
gift
in
the
following
year
mahmud
led
his
army
toward
ghor
the
native
prince
of
that
country
mahomet
of
the
sur
tribe
of
afghans
with
ten
thousand
troops
opposed
him
the
king
finding
that
the
troops
of
ghor
defended
themselves
in
their
intrenchments
with
such
obstinacy
commanded
his
army
to
make
a
feint
of
retreating
to
lure
the
enemy
out
of
their
fortified
camp
which
manoeuvre
proved
successful
the
ghorians
being
deceived
pursued
the
army
of
ghazni
to
the
plain
where
the
king
facing
round
with
his
troops
attacked
them
with
great
impetuosity
mahomet
was
taken
prisoner
and
brought
to
the
king
but
in
his
despair
he
had
taken
poison
which
he
always
kept
under
his
ring
and
died
in
a
few
hours
his
country
was
annexed
to
the
dominion
of
ghazni
some
historians
affirm
that
neither
the
sovereigns
of
ghor
nor
its
inhabitants
were
mussulmans
till
after
this
victory
while
others
of
good
credit
assure
us
that
they
were
converted
many
years
before
even
so
early
as
the
time
of
the
famous
ali
the
of
the
prophet
mahmud
in
the
same
year
was
under
the
necessity
of
marching
again
to
multan
which
had
revolted
but
having
soon
reduced
it
and
cut
off
a
great
number
of
the
chiefs
he
brought
daud
the
son
of
nazir
the
rebellious
governor
prisoner
to
ghazni
and
imprisoned
him
in
the
fort
of
gorci
for
life
in
the
year
the
passion
of
war
fermenting
in
the
mind
of
mahmud
he
resolved
upon
the
conquest
of
tannasar
in
the
kingdom
of
hindustan
it
had
reached
the
ears
of
the
king
that
tannasar
was
held
in
the
same
veneration
by
idolaters
as
mecca
was
by
the
mahometans
that
there
they
had
set
up
a
great
number
of
idols
the
chief
of
which
they
called
jug
sum
this
jug
sum
they
pretended
to
say
existed
when
as
yet
the
world
existed
not
when
the
king
reached
the
country
about
the
five
branches
of
the
indus
he
desired
that
according
to
the
treaty
that
existed
between
himself
and
annandpal
he
should
not
be
disturbed
by
his
march
through
that
country
he
accordingly
sent
an
embassy
to
annandpal
advising
him
of
his
intentions
and
desiring
him
to
send
guards
for
the
protection
of
his
towns
and
villages
which
he
the
king
would
take
care
should
not
be
molested
by
the
followers
of
his
camp
annandpal
agreed
to
this
proposal
and
prepared
an
entertainment
for
the
reception
of
the
king
issuing
an
order
for
all
his
subjects
to
supply
the
royal
camp
with
every
necessary
of
life
in
the
mean
time
he
sent
his
brother
with
two
thousand
horse
to
meet
the
king
and
deliver
this
message
that
he
was
the
subject
and
slave
of
the
king
but
that
he
begged
permission
to
acquaint
his
majesty
that
tannasar
was
the
principal
place
of
worship
of
the
inhabitants
of
that
country
that
if
it
was
a
virtue
required
by
the
religion
of
mahmud
to
destroy
the
religion
of
others
he
had
already
acquitted
himself
of
that
duty
to
his
god
in
the
destruction
of
the
temple
of
nagracot
but
if
he
should
be
pleased
to
alter
his
resolution
against
tannasar
annandpal
would
undertake
that
the
amount
of
the
revenues
of
that
country
should
be
annually
paid
to
mahmud
to
reimburse
the
expense
of
his
expedition
that
besides
he
on
his
own
part
would
present
him
with
fifty
elephants
and
jewels
to
a
considerable
amount
the
king
replied
that
in
the
mahometan
religion
it
was
an
established
tenet
that
the
more
the
glory
of
the
prophet
was
exalted
and
the
more
his
followers
exerted
themselves
in
the
subversion
of
idolatry
the
greater
would
be
their
reward
in
heaven
that
therefore
it
was
his
firm
resolution
with
the
assistance
of
god
to
root
out
the
abominable
worship
of
idols
from
the
land
of
india
why
then
should
he
spare
tannasar
when
this
news
reached
the
indian
king
of
delhi
he
prepared
to
oppose
the
invaders
sending
messages
all
over
hindustan
to
acquaint
the
rajahs
that
mahmud
without
any
reason
or
provocation
was
marching
with
an
innumerable
army
to
destroy
tannasar
which
was
under
his
immediate
protection
that
if
a
dam
was
not
expeditiously
raised
against
this
roaring
torrent
the
country
of
hindustan
would
soon
be
overwhelmed
in
ruin
and
the
tree
of
prosperity
rooted
up
that
therefore
it
was
advisable
for
them
to
join
their
forces
at
tannasar
to
oppose
with
united
strength
the
impending
danger
but
mahmud
reached
tannasar
before
they
could
take
any
measure
for
its
defence
plundered
the
city
and
broke
the
idols
sending
jug
sum
to
ghazni
where
he
was
soon
stripped
of
his
ornaments
he
then
ordered
his
head
to
be
struck
off
and
his
body
to
be
thrown
on
the
highway
according
to
the
account
of
the
historian
hago
mahomet
of
kandahar
there
was
a
ruby
found
in
one
of
the
temples
which
weighed
four
hundred
and
fifty
miskals
mahmud
after
these
transactions
at
tannasar
proceeded
to
delhi
which
he
also
took
and
wanted
greatly
to
annex
to
his
dominions
but
his
nobles
told
him
that
it
was
impossible
to
keep
the
rajahship
of
delhi
till
he
had
entirely
subjected
multan
to
mahometan
rule
destroyed
the
power
and
exterminated
the
family
of
annandpal
prince
of
lahore
which
lay
between
delhi
and
the
northern
dominions
of
mahmud
the
king
approved
of
this
counsel
and
immediately
determined
to
proceed
no
further
against
that
country
till
he
had
accomplished
the
reduction
of
multan
and
annandpal
but
that
prince
behaved
with
so
much
policy
and
hospitality
that
he
changed
the
purpose
of
the
king
who
returned
to
ghazni
he
brought
to
ghazni
forty
thousand
captives
and
much
wealth
so
that
that
city
could
now
be
hardly
distinguished
in
riches
from
india
itself

david
hume
after
the
success
of
king
alfred
over
the
danes
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
ninth
century
england
enjoyed
a
considerable
respite
from
the
invasions
of
the
bold
ravagers
who
had
caused
great
suffering
and
loss
to
the
country
this
immunity
of
england
seems
to
have
been
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
the
danish
adventurers
had
gained
a
foothold
in
the
north
of
france
where
they
found
all
the
employment
they
needed
in
maintaining
their
establishments
under
the
reign
of

the
elder
chosen
to
succeed
alfred
the

during

time
and
under
the
following
reigns
known
as
those
of

six
the
social
side
of

had
an
opportunity
to
develop
from
a
to
a
more
civilized
state
the
bare
and
rough
walls
of

were
screened
by
tapestry
hangings
often
of
silk
and
elaborately
ornamented
with
birds
and
flowers
or
scenes
from
the
battlefield
or
the
chase
chairs
and
tables
were
skilfully
carved
and
inlaid
with
different
woods
and
among
the
wealthier
nobility
often
decorated
with
gold
and
silver
knives
and
spoons
were
now
used
at
table
the

long
years
later
golden
ornaments
were
worn
and
a
variety
of
dishes
were
fashioned

of
precious
metals
brass

bone
the
bedstead
became
a
household
article
no
longer
looked
upon
with
superstitious
awe
and
musical
instruments
principally
of
the
harp
pattern
began
to
find
favor
in
their
eyes
and
were
passed
round
from

like

at

rude
festivals
but
toward
the

of

century
following
the

which

in
the
triumph
of

and
the

subjugation
of

are
hereinafter
narrated
by
hume
the
english
historian
the
danes
had
been
established
during
a
longer
period
in
england
than
in
france
and
though
the
similarity
of
their
original
language
to
that
of
the
saxons
invited
them
to
a
more
early
coalition
with
the
natives
they
had
hitherto
found
so
little
example
of
civilized
manners
among
the
english
that
they
retained
all
their
ancient
ferocity
and
valued
themselves
only
on
their
national
character
of
military
bravery
the
recent
as
well
as
more
ancient
achievements
of
their
countrymen
tended
to
support
this
idea
and
the
english
princes
particularly
athelstan
and
edgar
sensible
of
that
superiority
had
been
accustomed
to
keep
in
pay
bodies
of
danish
troops
who
were
quartered
about
the
country
and
committed
many
violences
upon
the
inhabitants
these
mercenaries
had
attained
to
such
a
height
of
luxury
according
to
the
old
english
writers
that
they
combed
their
hair
once
a
day
bathed
themselves
once
a
week
changed
their
clothes
frequently
and
by
all
these
arts
of
effeminacy
as
well
as
by
their
military
character
had
rendered
themselves
so
agreeable
to
the
fair
sex
that
they
debauched
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
english
and
dishonored
many
families
but
what
most
provoked
the
inhabitants
was
that
instead
of
defending
them
against
invaders
they
were
ever
ready
to
betray
them
to
the
foreign
danes
and
to
associate
themselves
with
all
straggling
parties
of
that
nation
the
animosity
between
the
inhabitants
of
english
and
danish
race
had
from
these
repeated
injuries
risen
to
a
great
height
when
ethelred
from
a
policy
incident
to
weak
princes
embraced
the
cruel
resolution
of
massacring
the
latter
throughout
all
his
dominions
secret
orders
were
despatched
to
commence
the
execution
everywhere
on
the
same
day
and
the
festival
of
brice
which
fell
on
a
sunday
the
day
on
which
the
danes
usually
bathed
themselves
was
chosen
for
that
purpose
it
is
needless
to
repeat
the
accounts
transmitted
concerning
the
barbarity
of
this
massacre
the
rage
of
the
populace
excited
by
so
many
injuries
sanctioned
by
authority
and
stimulated
by
example
distinguished
not
between
innocence
and
guilt
spared
neither
sex
nor
age
and
was
not
satiated
without
the
tortures
as
well
as
death
of
the
unhappy
victims
even
gunhilda
sister
to
the
king
of
denmark
who
had
married
earl
paling
and
had
embraced
christianity
was
by
the
advice
of
edric
earl
of
wilts
seized
and
condemned
to
death
by
ethelred
after
seeing
her
husband
and
children
butchered
before
her
face
this
unhappy
princess
foretold
in
the
agonies
of
despair
that
her
murder
would
soon
be
avenged
by
the
total
ruin
of
the
english
nation
never
was
prophecy
better
fulfilled
and
never
did
barbarous
policy
prove
more
fatal
to
the
authors
sweyn
and
his
danes
who
wanted
but
a
pretence
for
invading
the
english
appeared
off
the
western
coast
and
threatened
to
take
full
revenge
for
the
slaughter
of
their
countrymen
exeter

first
into

from
the
negligence
or
treachery
of
earl
hugh
a
norman
who
had
been
made
governor
by
the
interest
of
queen
emma
they
began
to
spread
their
devastations
over
the
country
when
the
english
sensible
what
outrages
they
must
now
expect
from
their
barbarous
and
offended
enemy
assembled
more
early
and
in
greater
numbers
than
usual
and
made
an
appearance
of
vigorous
resistance
but
all
these
preparations
were
frustrated
by
the
treachery
of
duke
alfric
who
was
intrusted
with
the
command
and
who
feigning
sickness
refused
to
lead
the
army
against
the
danes
till
it
was
dispirited
and
at
last
dissipated
by
his
fatal
misconduct
alfric
soon
after
died
and
edric
a
greater

he
who
had
married
the
king

and
had
acquired
a
total
ascendant
over
him
succeeded
alfric
in
the
government
of
mercia
and
in
the
command
of
the
english
armies
a
great
famine
proceeding
partly
from
the
bad
seasons
partly
from
the
decay
of
agriculture
added
to
all
the
other
miseries
of
the
inhabitants
the
country
wasted
by
the
danes
harassed
by
the
fruitless
expeditions
of
its
own
forces
was
reduced
to
the
utmost
desolation
and
at
last
submitted
to
the
infamy
of
purchasing
a
precarious
peace
from
the
enemy
by
the
payment
of
thirty
thousand
pounds
the
english
endeavored
to
employ
this
interval
in
making
preparations
against
the
return
of
the
danes
which
they
had
reason
soon
to
expect
a
law
was
made
ordering
the
proprietors
of
eight
hides
of
land
to
provide
each
a
horseman
and
a
complete
suit
of
armor
and
those
of
three
hundred
and
ten
hides
to
equip
a
ship
for
the
defence
of
the
coast
when
this
navy
was
assembled
which
must
have
consisted
of
near
eight
hundred
vessels
all
hopes
of
its
success
were
disappointed
by
the
factions
animosities
and
dissensions
of
the
nobility
edric
had
impelled
his
brother
brightric
to
prefer
an
accusation
of
treason
against
wolfnoth
governor
of
sussex
the
father
of
the
famous
earl
godwin
and
that
nobleman
well
acquainted
with
the
malevolence
as
well
as
power
of
his
enemy
found
no
means
of
safety
but
in
deserting
with
twenty
ships
to
the
danes
brightric
pursued
him
with
a
fleet
of
eighty
sail
but
his
ships
being
shattered
in
a
tempest
and
stranded
on
the
coast
he
was
suddenly
attacked
by
wolfnoth
and
all
his
vessels
burned
and
destroyed
the
imbecility
of
the
king
was
little
capable
of
repairing
this
misfortune
the
treachery
of
edric
frustrated
every
plan
for
future
defence
and
the
english
navy
disconcerted
discouraged
and
divided
was
at
last
scattered
into
its
several
harbors
it
is
almost
impossible
or
would
be
tedious
to
relate
particularly
all
the
miseries
to
which
the
english
were
henceforth
exposed
we
hear
of
nothing
but
the
sacking
and
burning
of
towns
the
devastation
of
the
open
country
the
appearance
of
the
enemy
in
every
quarter
of
the
kingdom
their
cruel
diligence
in
discovering
any
corner
which
had
not
been
ransacked
by
their
former
violence
the
broken
and
disjointed
narration
of
the
ancient
historians
is
here
well
adapted
to
the
nature
of
the
war
which
was
conducted
by
such
sudden
inroads
as
would
have
been
dangerous
even
to
a
united
and
kingdom
but
proved
fatal
where
nothing
but
a
general
consternation
and
mutual
diffidence
and
dissension
prevailed
the
governors
of
one
province
refused
to
march
to
the
assistance
of
another
and
were
at
last
terrified
from
assembling
their
forces
for
the
defence
of
their
own
province
general
councils
were
summoned
but
either
no
resolution
was
taken
or
none
was
carried
into
execution
and
the
only
expedient
in
which
the
english
agreed
was
the
base
and
imprudent
one
of
buying
a
new
peace
from
the
danes
by
the
payment
of
thousand
pounds
this
measure
did
not
bring
them
even
that
short
interval
of
repose
which
they
had
expected
from
it
the
danes
disregarding
all
engagements
continued
their
devastations
and
hostilities
levied
a
new
contribution
of
eight
thousand
pounds
upon
the
county
of
kent
alone
murdered
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
who
had
refused
to
countenance
this
exaction
and
the
english
nobility
found
no
other
resource
than
that
of
submitting
everywhere
to
the
danish
monarch
swearing
allegiance
to
him
and
delivering
him
hostages
for
their
fidelity
ethelred
equally
afraid
of
the
violence
of
the
enemy
and
the
treachery
of
his
own
subjects
fled
into
normandy
whither
he
had
sent
before
him
queen
emma
and
her
two
sons
alfred
and
edward
richard
received
his
unhappy
guests
with
a
generosity
that
does
honor
to
his
memory
the
king
had
not
been
above
six
weeks
in
normandy
when
he
heard
of
the
death
of
sweyn
who
expired
at
gainsborough
before
he
had
time
to
establish
himself
in
his
dominions
the
english
prelates
and
nobility
taking
advantage
of
this
event
sent
over
a
deputation
to
normandy
inviting
ethelred
to
return
to
them
expressing
a
desire
of
being
again
governed
by
their
native
prince
and
intimating
their
hopes
that
being
now
tutored
by
experience
he
would
avoid
all
those
errors
which
had
been
attended
with
such
misfortunes
to
himself
and
to
his
people
but
the
misconduct
of
ethelred
was
incurable
and
on
his
resuming
the
government
he
discovered
the
same
incapacity
indolence
cowardice
and
credulity
which
had
so
often
exposed
him
to
the
insults
of
his
enemies
his
edric
notwithstanding
his
repeated
treasons
retained
such
influence
at
court
as
to
instil
into
the
king
jealousies
of
sigefert
and
morcar
two
of
the
chief
nobles
of
mercia
edric
allured
them
into
his
house
where
he
murdered
them
while
ethelred
participated
in
the
infamy
of
the
action
by
confiscating
their
estates
and
thrusting
into
a
convent
the
widow
of
sigefert
she
was
a
woman
of
singular
beauty
and
merit
and
in
a
visit
which
was
paid
her
during
her
confinement
by
prince
edmund
the
king
eldest
son
she
inspired
him
with
so
violent
an
affection
that
he
released
her
from
the
convent
and
soon
after
married
her
without
the
consent
of
his
father
meanwhile
the
english
found
in
canute
the
son
and
successor
of
sweyn
an
enemy
no
less
terrible
than
the
prince
from
whom
death
had
so
lately
delivered
them
he
ravaged
the
eastern
coast
with
merciless
fury
and
put
ashore
all
the
english
hostages
at
sandwich
after
having
cut
off
their
hands
and
noses
he
was
obliged
by
the
necessity
of
his
affairs
to
make
a
voyage
to
denmark
but
returning
soon
after
he
continued
his
depredations
along
the
southern
coast
he
even
broke
into
the
counties
of
dorset
wilts
and
somerset
where
an
army
was
assembled
against
him
under
the
command
of
prince
edmund
and
duke
edric
the
latter
still
continued
his
perfidious
machinations
and
after
endeavoring
in
vain
to
get
the
prince
into
his
power
he
found
means
to
disperse
the
army
and
he
then
openly
deserted
to
canute
with
forty
vessels
notwithstanding
this
misfortune
edmund
was
not
disconcerted
but
assembling
all
the
force
of
england
was
in
a
condition
to
give
battle
to
the
enemy
the
king
had
had
such
frequent
experience
of
perfidy
among
his
subjects
that
he
had
lost
all
confidence
in
them
he
remained
at
london
pretending
sickness
but
really
from
apprehensions
that
they
intended
to
buy
their
peace
by
delivering
him
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies
the
army
called
aloud
for
their
sovereign
to
march
at
their
head
against
the
danes
and
on
his
refusal
to
take
the
field
they
were
so
discouraged
that
those
vast
preparations
became
ineffectual
for
the
defence
of
the
kingdom
edmund
deprived
of
all
regular
supplies
to
maintain
his
soldiers
was
obliged
to
commit
equal
ravages
with
those
which
were
practised
by
the
danes
and
after
making
some
fruitless
expeditions
into
the
north
which
had
submitted
entirely
to
power
he
retired
to
london
determined
there
to
maintain
to
the
last
extremity
the
small
remains
of
english
liberty
he
here
found
everything
in
confusion
by
the
death
of
the
king
who
expired
after
an
unhappy
and
inglorious
reign
of
years
he
left
two
sons
by
his
first
marriage
edmund
who
succeeded
him
and
edwy
whom
canute
afterward
murdered
his
two
sons
by
the
second
marriage
alfred
and
edward
were
immediately
upon
ethelred
death
conveyed
into
normandy
by
queen
emma
edmund
who
received
the
name
of
ironside
from
his
hardy
valor
possessed
courage
and
abilities
sufficient
to
have
prevented
his
country
from
sinking
into
those
calamities
but
not
to
raise
it
from
that
abyss
of
misery
into
which
it
had
already
fallen
among
the
other
misfortunes
of
the
english
treachery
and
disaffection
had
crept
in
among
the
nobility
and
prelates
and
edmund
found
no
better
expedient
for
stopping
the
further
progress
of
these
fatal
evils
than
to
lead
his
army
instantly
into
the
field
and
to
employ
them
against
the
common
enemy
after
meeting
with
some
success
at
gillingham
he
prepared
himself
to
decide
in
one
general
engagement
the
fate
of
his
crown
and
at
scoerston
in
the
county
of
gloucester
he
offered
battle
to
the
enemy
who
were
commanded
by
canute
and
edric
fortune
in
the
beginning
of
the
day
declared
for
him
but
edric
having
cut
off
the
head
of
one
osmer
whose
countenance
resembled
that
of
edmund
fixed
it
on
a
spear
carried
it
through
the
ranks
in
triumph
and
called
aloud
to
the
english
that
it
was
time
to
fly
for
behold
the
head
of
their
sovereign
and
though
edmund
observing
the
consternation
of
the
troops
took
off
his
helmet
and
showed
himself
to
them
the
utmost
he
could
gain
by
his
activity
and
valor
was
to
leave
the
victory
undecided
edric
now
took
a
surer
method
to
ruin
him
by
pretending
to
desert
to
him
and
as
edmund
was
well
acquainted
with
his
power
and
probably
knew
no
other
of
the
chief
nobility
in
whom
he
could
repose
more
confidence
he
was
obliged
notwithstanding
the
repeated
perfidy
of
the
man
to
give
him
a
considerable
command
in
the
army
a
battle
soon
after
ensued
at
assington
in
essex
where
edric
flying
in
the
beginning
of
the
day
occasioned
the
total
defeat
of
the
english
followed
by
a
great
slaughter
of
the
nobility
the
indefatigable
edmund
however
had
still
resources
assembling
a
new
army
at
gloucester
he
was
again
in
condition
to
dispute
the
field
when
the
danish
and
english
nobility
equally
harassed
with
those
convulsions
obliged
their
kings
to
come
to
a
compromise
and
to
divide
the
kingdom
between
them
by
treaty
canute
reserved
to
himself
the
northern
division
consisting
of
mercia
east
anglia
and
northumberland
which
he
had
entirely
subdued
the
southern
parts
were
left
to
edmund
this
prince
survived
the
treaty
about
a
month
he
was
murdered
at
oxford
by
two
of
his
chamberlains
accomplices
of
edric
who
thereby
made
way
for
the
succession
of
canute
the
dane
to
the
crown
of
england
the
english
who
had
been
unable
to
defend
their
country
and
maintain
their
independency
under
so
active
and
brave
a
prince
as
edmund
could
after
his
death
expect
nothing
but
total
subjection
from
canute
who
active
and
brave
himself
and
at
the
head
of
a
great
force
was
ready
to
take
advantage
of
the
minority
of
edwin
and
edward
the
two
sons
of
edmund
yet
this
conqueror
who
was
commonly
so
little
scrupulous
showed
himself
anxious
to
cover
his
injustice
under
plausible
pretences
before
he
seized
the
dominions
of
the
english
princes
he
summoned
a
general
assembly
of
the
states
in
order
to
fix
the
succession
of
the
kingdom
he
here
suborned
some
nobles
to
depose
that
in
the
treaty
of
gloucester
it
had
been
verbally
agreed
either
to
name
canute
in
case
of
edmund
death
successor
to
his
dominions
or
tutor
to
his
children
for
historians
vary
in
this
particular
and
that
evidence
supported
by
the
great
power
of
canute
determined
the
states
immediately
to
put
the
danish
monarch
in
possession
of
the
government
canute
jealous
of
the
two
princes
but
sensible
that
he
should
render
himself
extremely
odious
if
he
ordered
them
to
be
despatched
in
england
sent
them
abroad
to
his
ally
the
king
of
sweden
whom
he
desired
as
soon
as
they
arrived
at
his
court
to
free
him
by
their
death
from
all
further
anxiety
the
swedish
monarch
was
too
generous
to
comply
with
the
request
but
being
afraid
of
drawing
on
himself
a
quarrel
with
canute
by
protecting
the
young
princes
he
sent
them
to
solomon
king
of
hungary
to
be
educated
in
his
court
the
elder
edwin
was
afterward
married
to
the
sister
of
the
king
of
hungary
but
the
english
prince
dying
without
issue
solomon
gave
his
agatha
daughter
of
the
emperor
henry
ii
in
marriage
to
edward
the
younger
brother
and
she
bore
him
edgar
atheling
margaret
afterward
queen
of
scotland
and
christina
who
retired
into
a
convent
canute
though
he
had
reached
the
great
point
of
his
ambition
in
obtaining
possession
of
the
english
crown
was
obliged
at
first
to
make
great
sacrifices
to
it
and
to
gratify
the
chief
of
the
nobility
by
bestowing
on
them
the
most
extensive
governments
and
jurisdictions
he
created
thurkill
earl
or
duke
of
east
anglia
for
these
titles
were
then
nearly
of
the
same
import
yric
of
northumberland
and
edric
of
mercia
reserving
only
to
himself
the
administration
of
wessex
but
seizing
afterward
a
favorable
opportunity
he
expelled
thurkill
and
yric
from
their
governments
and
banished
them
the
kingdom
he
put
to
death
many
of
the
english
nobility
on
whose
fidelity
he
could
not
rely
and
whom
he
hated
on
account
of
their
disloyalty
to
their
native
prince
and
even
the
traitor
edric
having
had
the
assurance
to
reproach
him
with
his
services
was
condemned
to
be
executed
and
his
body
to
be
thrown
into
the
thames
a
suitable
reward
for
his
multiplied
acts
of
perfidy
and
rebellion
canute
also
found
himself
obliged
in
the
beginning
of
his
reign
to
load
the
people
with
heavy
taxes
in
order
to
reward
his
danish
followers
he
exacted
from
them
at
one
time
the
sum
of
thousand
pounds
besides
eleven
thousand
which
he
levied
on
london
alone
he
was
probably
willing
from
political
motives
to
mulct
severely
that
city
on
account
of
the
affection
which
it
had
borne
to
edmund
and
the
resistance
which
it
had
made
to
the
danish
power
in
two
obstinate
sieges
but
these
rigors
were
imputed
to
necessity
and
canute
like
a
wise
prince
was
determined
that
the
english
now
deprived
of
all
their
dangerous
leaders
should
be
reconciled
to
the
danish
yoke
by
the
justice
and
impartiality
of
his
administration
he
sent
back
to
denmark
as
many
of
his
followers
as
he
could
safely
spare
he
restored
the
saxon
customs
in
a
general
assembly
of
the
states
he
made
no
distinction
between
danes
and
english
in
the
distribution
of
justice
and
he
took
care
by
a
strict
execution
of
law
to
protect
the
lives
and
properties
of
all
his
people
the
danes
were
gradually
incorporated
with
his
new
subjects
and
both
were
glad
to
obtain
a
little
respite
from
those
multiplied
calamities
from
which
the
one
no
less
than
the
other
had
in
their
fierce
contest
for
power
experienced
such
fatal
consequences
footnote
in
one
of
these
sieges
canute
diverted
the
course
of
the
thames
and
by
that
means
brought
his
ships
above
london
bridge
the
removal
of
edmund
children
into
so
distant
a
country
as
hungary
was
next
to
their
death
regarded
by
canute
as
the
greatest
security
to
his
government
he
had
no
further
anxiety
except
with
regard
to
alfred
and
edward
who
were
protected
and
supported
by
their
uncle
richard
duke
of
normandy
richard
even
fitted
out
a
great
armament
in
order
to
restore
the
english
princes
to
the
throne
of
their
ancestors
and
though
the
navy
was
dispersed
by
a
storm
canute
saw
the
danger
to
which
he
was
exposed
from
the
enmity
of
so
warlike
a
people
as
the
normans
in
order
to
acquire
the
friendship
of
the
duke
he
paid
his
addresses
to
queen
emma
sister
of
that
prince
and
promised
that
he
would
leave
the
children
whom
he
should
have
by
that
marriage
in
possession
of
the
crown
of
england
richard
complied
with
his
demand
and
sent
over
emma
to
england
where
she
was
soon
after
married
to
canute
the
english
though
they
disapproved
of
her
espousing
the
mortal
enemy
of
her
former
husband
and
his
family
were
pleased
to
find
at
court
a
sovereign
to
whom
they
were
accustomed
and
who
had
already
formed
connections
with
them
and
thus
canute
besides
securing
by
this
marriage
the
alliance
of
normandy
gradually
acquired
by
the
same
means
the
confidence
of
his
own
subjects
the
norman
prince
did
not
long
survive
the
marriage
of
emma
and
he
left
the
inheritance
of
the
duchy
to
his
eldest
son
of
the
same
name
who
dying
a
year
after
him
without
children
was
succeeded
by
his
brother
robert
a
man
of
valor
and
abilities
canute
having
settled
his
power
in
england
beyond
all
danger
of
a
revolution
made
a
voyage
to
denmark
in
order
to
resist
the
attacks
of
the
king
of
sweden
and
he
carried
along
with
him
a
great
body
of
the
english
under
the
command
of
earl
godwin
this
nobleman
had
here
an
opportunity
of
performing
a
service
by
which
he
both
reconciled
the
king
mind
to
the
english
nation
and
gaining
to
himself
the
friendship
of
his
sovereign
laid
the
foundation
of
that
immense
fortune
which
he
acquired
to
his
family
he
was
stationed
next
the
swedish
camp
and
observing
a
favorable
opportunity
which
he
was
obliged
suddenly
to
seize
he
attacked
the
enemy
in
the
night
drove
them
from
their
trenches
threw
them
into
disorder
pursued
his
advantage
and
obtained
a
decisive
victory
over
them
next
morning
canute
seeing
the
english
camp
entirely
abandoned
imagined
that
those
disaffected
troops
had
deserted
to
the
enemy
he
was
agreeably
surprised
to
find
that
they
were
at
that
time
engaged
in
pursuit
of
the
discomfited
swedes
he
was
so
pleased
with
this
success
and
with
the
manner
of
obtaining
it
that
he
bestowed
his
daughter
in
marriage
upon
godwin
and
treated
him
ever
after
with
entire
confidence
and
regard
in
another
voyage
which
he
made
afterward
to
denmark
canute
attacked
norway
and
expelling
the
just
but
unwarlike
olaus
kept
possession
of
his
kingdom
till
the
death
of
that
prince
he
had
now
by
his
conquests
and
valor
attained
the
utmost
height
of
grandeur
having
leisure
from
wars
and
intrigues
he
felt
the
unsatisfactory
nature
of
all
human
enjoyments
and
equally
weary
of
the
glories
and
turmoils
of
this
life
he
began
to
cast
his
view
toward
that
future
existence
which
it
is
so
natural
for
the
human
mind
whether
satiated
by
prosperity
or
disgusted
with
adversity
to
make
the
object
of
its
attention
unfortunately
the
spirit
which
prevailed
in
that
age
gave
a
wrong
direction
to
his
devotion
instead
of
making
compensation
to
those
whom
he
had
injured
by
his
former
acts
of
violence
he
employed
himself
entirely
in
those
exercises
of
piety
which
the
monks
represented
as
the
most
meritorious
he
built
churches
he
endowed
monasteries
he
enriched
the
ecclesiastics
and
he
bestowed
revenues
for
the
support
of
chantries
at
assington
and
other
places
where
he
appointed
prayers
to
be
said
for
the
souls
of
those
who
had
there
fallen
in
battle
against
him
he
even
undertook
a
pilgrimage
to
rome
where
he
resided
a
considerable
time
besides
obtaining
from
the
pope
some
privileges
for
the
english
school
erected
there
he
engaged
all
the
princes
through
whose
dominions
he
was
obliged
to
pass
to
desist
from
those
heavy
impositions
and
tolls
which
they
were
accustomed
to
exact
from
the
english
pilgrims
by
this
spirit
of
devotion
no
less
than
by
his
equitable
and
politic
administration
he
gained
in
a
good
measure
the
affections
of
his
subjects
canute
the
greatest
and
most
powerful
monarch
of
his
time
sovereign
of
denmark
and
norway
as
well
as
of
england
could
not
fail
of
meeting
with
adulation
from
his
courtiers
a
tribute
which
is
liberally
paid
even
to
the
meanest
and
weakest
princes
some
of
his
flatterers
breaking
out
one
day
in
admiration
of
his
grandeur
exclaimed
that
everything
was
possible
for
him
upon
which
the
monarch
it
is
said
ordered
his
chair
to
be
set
on
the
while
the
tide
was
rising
and
as
the
waters
approached
he
commanded
them
to
retire
and
to
obey
the
voice
of
him
who
was
lord
of
the
ocean
he
feigned
to
sit
some
time
in
expectation
of
their
submission
but
when
the
sea
still
advanced
toward
him
and
began
to
wash
him
with
its
billows
he
turned
to
his
courtiers
and
remarked
to
them
that
every
creature
in
the
universe
was
feeble
and
impotent
and
that
power
resided
with
one
being
alone
in
whose
hands
were
all
the
elements
of
nature
who
could
say
to
the
ocean
thus
far
shalt
thou
go
and
no
farther
and
who
could
level
with
his
nod
the
most
towering
piles
of
human
pride
and
ambition
the
only
memorable
action
which
canute
performed
after
his
return
from
rome
was
an
expedition
against
malcolm
king
of
scotland
during
the
reign
of
ethelred
a
tax
of
a
shilling
a
hide
had
been
imposed
on
all
the
lands
of
england
it
was
commonly
called
because
the
revenue
had
been
employed
either
in
buying
peace
with
the
danes
or
in
making
preparations
against
the
inroads
of
that
hostile
nation
that
monarch
had
required
that
the
same
tax
should
be
paid
by
cumberland
which
was
held
by
the
scots
but
malcolm
a
warlike
prince
told
him
that
as
he
was
always
able
to
repulse
the
danes
by
his
own
power
he
would
neither
submit
to
buy
peace
of
his
enemies
nor
pay
others
for
resisting
them
ethelred
offended
at
this
reply
which
contained
a
secret
reproach
on
his
own
conduct
undertook
an
expedition
against
cumberland
but
though
he
committed
ravages
upon
the
country
he
could
never
bring
malcolm
to
a
temper
more
humble
or
submissive
canute
after
his
accession
summoned
the
scottish
king
to
acknowledge
himself
a
vassal
for
cumberland
to
the
crown
of
england
but
malcolm
refused
compliance
on
pretence
that
he
owed
homage
to
those
princes
only
who
inherited
that
kingdom
by
right
of
blood
canute
was
not
of
a
temper
to
bear
this
insult
and
the
king
of
scotland
soon
found
that
the
sceptre
was
in
very
different
hands
from
those
of
the
feeble
and
irresolute
ethelred
upon
canute
appearing
on
the
frontiers
with
a
formidable
army
malcolm
agreed
that
his
grandson
and
heir
duncan
whom
he
put
in
possession
of
cumberland
should
make
the
submissions
required
and
that
the
heirs
of
scotland
should
always
acknowledge
themselves
vassals
to
england
for
that
province
canute
passed
four
years
in
peace
after
this
enterprise
and
he
died
at
shaftesbury

three
sons

asserted

aroused

eventually
found
himself
obliged
to
abdicate
the
abbot
bartholomew
of
grotta
ferrata
urged
him
to
the
step
but
he
unblushingly
sold
the
papacy
for
money
like
a
piece
of
merchandise
in
exchange
for
a
considerable
income
that
is
to
say
for
the
revenue
of
peter
pence
from

he
made
over
his
papal
dignities
by
a
formal
contract
to
john
gratianus
a
rich
archpriest
of
the
church
of
john
at
the
latin
gate
on
may
could
the
holiest
office
in
christendom
be
more
deeply
outraged
than
by
a
sale
such
as
this
and
yet
so
general
was
the
traffic
in
ecclesiastical
dignities
throughout
the
world
that
when
a
pope
finally
sold
the
chair
of

the
scandal
did
not
strike

as
specially
heinous
john
gratian
or
gregory
vi
set
aside
the
canon
law
with
a
defiant
courage
which
perhaps
was
only
understood
by
the
minority
of
his
compatriots
he
bought
the
papacy
in
order
to
wrest
it
from
the
hands
of
a
criminal
and
this
remarkable
pope
although
regarded
as
an
idiot
in
that
terrible
period
was
possibly
an
earnest
and
man
scarcely
had
peter
damian
knowledge
of
this
traffic
when
he
wrote
to
gregory
vi
on
his
elevation
rejoicing
that
the
dove
with
the
olive
branch
had
returned
to
the
ark
the
saint
may
have
known
the
pope
personally
and
have
been
persuaded
of
his
spiritual
virtues
even
the
chroniclers
of
the
time
who
represent
him
assuredly
with
injustice
as
so
rude
and
simple
that
he
was
obliged
to
appoint
a
representative
are
unable
to
fasten
any
crime
upon
him
the
cluniacs
in
france
and
the
congregations
of
italy
all
hailed
his
elevation
as
the
beginning
of
a
better
time
and
side
by
side
with
this
simonist
pope
a
young
and
brave
monk
suddenly
appears
who
after
the
heroic
exertions
of
a
lifetime
was
to
raise
the
degenerate
papacy
to
a
height
hitherto
undreamed
of
hildebrand
first
issues
from
obscurity
by
the
side
of
gregory
vi
he
became
the
pope
chaplain
and
this
fact
alone
proves
that
gregory
was
no
idiot
how
far
hildebrand
activity
already
extended
whether
he
had
any
share
in
gregory
illegal
elevation
we
do
not
know
but
in
the
representative
spoken
of
by
the
chronicles
we
may
easily
recognize
the
gifted
young
monk
who
was
gregory
counsellor
and
who
later
took
the
name
of
gregory
vii
in
grateful
recollection
of
his
predecessor
while
benedict
ix
pursued
his
wild
career
in
tusculum
or
rome
gregory
vi
remained
pope
for
nearly
two
years
his
desire
was
to
save
the
church
which
stood
in
need
of
a
drastic
reform
and
which
soon
afterward
obtained
it
the
papacy
lately
a
hereditary
fief
of
the
counts
of
tusculum
was
utterly
ruined
the
the
ominous
gift
of
the
carlovingians
the
box
of
pandora
in
the
hands
of
the
pope
from
which
a
thousand
evils
had
arisen
had
disappeared
since
the
church
could
scarcely
command
the
fortresses
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
the
city
a
hundred
lords
the
captains
or
vassals
of
the
pope
stood
ready
to
fall
upon
rome
every
road
was
infested
with
robbers
every
pilgrim
was
robbed
within
the
city
the
churches
lay
in
ruins
while
the
priests
caroused
daily
assassinations
made
the
streets
insecure
roman
nobles
sword
in
hand
forced
their
way
into
itself
to
snatch
the
gifts
which
pious
hands
still
placed
upon
the
altar
the
chronicler
who
describes
this
state
of
things
extols
gregory
for
having
repressed
it
the
captains
it
is
true
besieged
the
city
but
the
pope
boldly
assembled
the
militia
restored
a
degree
of
order
and
even
conquered
several
fortresses
in
the
district
sylvester
had
apparently
made
an
attempt
on
rome
he
was
however
defeated
by
gregory
energy
the
short
and
dark
period
of
gregory
pontificate
was
terrible
and
his
severity
toward
the
robbers
soon
made
him
hated
by
the
nobles
and
even
by
the
equally
rapacious
cardinals
whatever
he
may
have
done
under
the
influence
of
french
and
italian
monks
to
rescue
the
church
from
its
state
of
barbarous
confusion
it
was
as
in
the
time
of
otto
the
great
by
the
german
dictatorship
alone
that
it
could
be
saved
the
exertions
of
gregory
vi
soon
ceased
to
bear
any
result
his
means
were
exhausted
and
his
opponents
gradually
overpowered
him
so
utter
was
the
state
of
anarchy
that
it
is
said
that
all
three
popes
lived
in
the
city
at
the
same
time
one
in
the
lateran
a
second
in
peter
and
a
third
in
santa
maria
maggiore
the
eyes
of
the
better
citizens
at
length
turned
to
the
king
of
germany
the
archdeacon
peter
convoked
a
synod
without
consulting
gregory
and
it
was
here
resolved
urgently
to
invite
henry
to
come
and
take
the
imperial
crown
and
raise
the
church
from
the
ruin
into
which
it
had
fallen
henry
coming
from
augsburg
crossed
the
brenner
and
arrived
at
verona
in
september
accompanied
by
a
great
army
and
filled
with
the
ardent
desire
of
becoming
the
reformer
of
the
church
no
enemy
opposed
him
the
bishops
and
dukes
among
them
the
powerful
margrave
boniface
of
tuscany
did
homage
without
delay
the
roman
situation
was
provisionally
discussed
at
a
great
synod
in
pavia
gregory
vi
now
hastened
to
meet
the
king
at
piacenza
where
he
hoped
to
gain
the
monarch
to
his
side
henry
however
dismissed
him
with
the
explanation
that
his
fate
and
that
of
the
antipopes
would
be
canonically
decided
by
a
council
shortly
before
christmas
he
assembled
one
thousand
and
bishops
and
roman
clergy
at
sutri
the
three
popes
were
summoned
and
gregory
and
sylvester
iii
actually
appeared
sylvester
was
deposed
from
his
pontificate
and
condemned
to
penance
in
a
monastery
gregory
vi
however
gave
the
council
cause
to
doubt
its
competence
to
judge
him
gregory
who
was
an
upright
man
or
one
at
least
conscious
of
good
intentions
consented
publicly
to
describe
the
circumstances
of
his
elevation
and
was
thereby
forced
to
condemn
himself
as
guilty
of
simony
and
unworthy
of
the
papal
office
he
quietly
laid
down
the
insignia
of
the
papacy
and
his
renunciation
did
him
honor
henry
with
the
bishops
and
the
margrave
boniface
immediately
started
for
the
city
which
did
not
shut
its
gates
against
him
for
benedict
ii
had
hid
himself
in
tusculum
and
his
brothers
did
not
venture
on
any
resistance
rome
weary
of
the
tusculum
horrors
joyfully
accepted
the
german
king
as
her
deliverer
never
afterward
was
a
king
of
germany
received
with
such
glad
acclamations
by
the
roman
people
never
again
did
any
other
effect
such
great
results
or
achieve
the
like
changes
with
the
roman
expedition
of
henry
iii
begins
a
new
epoch
in
the
history
of
the
city
and
more
especially
of
the
church
it
seemed
as
if
the
waters
of
the
deluge
had
subsided
and
as
if
men
from
the
ark
had
landed
on
the
rock
of
peter
to
give
new
races
and
new
laws
to
a
new
world
what
law
that
stern
and
terrible
power
which
kills
binds
and
holds
together
signifies
in
human
affairs
has
indeed
been
experienced
by
few
periods
so
fully
as
by
that
with
which
we
have
now
to
deal
a
synod
assembled
in
peter
on
december
again
pronounced
all
three
popes
deposed
and
a
canonical
pope
had
consequently
to
be
elected
like
otto
iii
before
his
coronation
henry
had
also
at
his
side
a
man
who
was
to
wear
the
tiara
and
to
confer
the
crown
upon
himself
adalbert
of
hamburg
and
bremen
having
refused
the
papacy
the
king
chose
suidger
of
bamberg
the
royal
command
was
all
that
was
required
to
place
the
candidate
on
the
sacred
chair
henry
however
would
not
violate
any
of
the
canonical
forms
as
king
of
germany
he
possessed
no
right
either
over
that
city
or
yet
over
the
papal
election
the
right
must
first
be
conferred
upon
him
and
this
was
done
by
a
treaty
which
he
had
already
concluded
with
the
romans
at
sutri
roman
signors
said
henry
at
the
second
sitting
of
the
synod
on
december
however
thoughtless
your
conduct
may
hitherto
have
been
i
still
accord
you
liberty
to
elect
a
pope
according
to
ancient
custom
choose
from
among
this
assembly
whom
you
will
the
romans
replied
when
the
royal
majesty
is
present
the
assent
to
the
election
does
not
belong
to
us
and
when
it
is
lacking
you
are
represented
by
your
for
in
the
affairs
of
the
republic
the
patricius
is
not
patricius
of
the
pope
but
of
the
emperor
we
admit
that
we
have
been
so
thoughtless
as
to
appoint
idiots
as
popes
it
now
behooves
your
imperial
power
to
give
the
roman
republic
the
benefit
of
law
the
ornament
of
manners
and
to
lend
the
arm
of
protection
to
the
church
the
senators
of
the
year
who
so
meekly
surrendered
the
valuable
right
to
the
german
king
heeded
not
the
shades
of
alberic
and
the
three
crescentii
since
these
their
patricians
would
have
accused
them
of
treason
the
romans
of
these
days
were
however
ready
for
any
sacrifice
so
that
they
obtained
freedom
from
the
tusculum
tyranny
nothing
more
clearly
shows
the
utter
depth
of
their
exhaustion
and
the
extent
of
their
sufferings
than
the
light
surrender
of
a
right
which
it
had
formerly
cost
otto
the
great
such
repeated
efforts
to
extort
from
the
city
rome
made
the
humiliating
confession
that
she
possessed
no
priest
worthy
of
the
papacy
that
the
clergy
in
the
city
were
rude
and
utter
simonists
all
other
circumstances
moreover
forbade
the
election
of
a
roman
or
even
of
an
italian
to
the
papacy
the
romans
besought
henry
to
give
them
a
good
pope
he
presented
the
bishop
of
bamberg
to
the
assenting
clergy
and
led
the
reluctant
candidate
to
the
apostolic
chair
clement
ii
consecrated
on
christmas
day
immediately
placed
the
imperial
crown
on
henry
head
and
on
that
of
his
wife
agnes
there
were
still
many
romans
who
had
been
of
like
transactions
that
is
to
say
of
papal
election
and
imperial
coronation
following
one
the
other
in
immediate
succession
in
the
case
of
otto
iii
and
henry
v
who
as
they
now
saw
the
second
german
pope
mount
the
chair
of
peter
may
have
recalled
the
fact
that
the
first
had
only
lived
a
few
sad
years
in
rome
and
had
died
in
misery
the
coronation
of
henry
iii
was
performed
under
such
significant
conditions
and
in
such
perfect
tranquillity
that
it
offers
the
most
fitting
opportunity
for
describing
in
a
few
sentences
the
ceremonial
of
the
imperial
coronation
since
charles
the
great
these
repeated
ceremonies
with
the
more
frequent
coronations
or
lateran
processions
of
the
popes
formed
the
most
brilliant
spectacle
in
rome
when
the
approached
with
his
wife
and
retinue
he
first
took
an
oath
to
the
romans
at
the
little
bridge
on
the
neronian
field
faithfully
to
observe
the
rights
and
usages
of
the
city
on
the
day
of
the
coronation
he
made
his
entrance
through
the
porta
castella
close
to
angelo
and
here
repeated
the
oath
the
clergy
and
the
corporations
of
rome
greeted
him
at
the
church
of
santa
maria
traspontina
on
a
legendary
site
called
the
terebinthus
of
nero
the
solemn
procession
then
advanced
to
the
steps
of
the
cathedral
senators
walked
by
the
side
of
the
king
the
prefect
of
the
city
carried
the
naked
sword
before
him
and
his
chamberlains
scattered
money
arrived
at
the
steps
he
dismounted
from
his
horse
and
accompanied
by
his
retinue
ascended
to
the
platform
where
the
pope
surrounded
by
the
higher
clergy
awaited
him
sitting
the
king
stooped
to
kiss
the
foot
tendered
the
oath
to
be
an
upright
protector
of
the
church
received
from
the
pope
the
kiss
of
peace
and
was
adopted
by
him
as
the
son
of
the
church
with
solemn
song
both
king
and
pope
entered
the
church
of
santa
maria
in
turri
beside
the
steps
of
peter
and
here
the
king
was
formally
made
canon
of
the
cathedral
he
then
advanced
conducted
by
the
lateran
count
of
the
palace
and
by
the
of
the
judges
to
the
silver
door
of
the
cathedral
where
he
prayed
and
the
bishop
of
albano
delivered
the
first
oration
innumerable
mystic
ceremonies
awaited
the
king
in
peter
itself
here
a
short
way
from
the
entrance
was
the
a
round
porphyry
stone
inserted
in
the
pavement
on
which
the
king
and
pope
knelt
the
imperial
candidate
here
made
his
profession
of
faith
the
of
portus
placed
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
rota
and
pronounced
the
second
oration
the
king
was
then
draped
in
new
vestments
was
made
a
cleric
in
the
sacristy
by
the
pope
was
clad
with
tunic
dalmatica
pluviale
mitre
and
sandals
and
was
then
led
to
the
altar
of
maurice
whither
his
wife
after
similar
but
less
fatiguing
ceremonies
accompanied
him
the
bishop
of
ostia
here
anointed
the
king
on
the
right
arm
and
neck
and
delivered
the
third
oration
if
the
were
fitted
by
the
dignity
of
his
calling
then
the
solemnity
of
the
function
the
mystic
and
tedious
pomp
the
magnificent
monotone
of
prayer
and
song
in
the
ancient
cathedral
hallowed
by
so
many
exalted
memories
must
have
stirred
his
inmost
soul
the
pinnacle
of
all
human
ambition
the
crown
of
charles
the
great
lay
glittering
before
his
longing
eyes
on
the
altar
of
the
prince
of
the
apostles
the
pope
however
first
placed
a
ring
on
the
finger
of
the
anointed
as
symbol
of
the
faith
the
permanence
and
strength
of
his
catholic
rule
with
similar
formulæ
girt
him
with
the
sword
and
finally
placed
the
crown
upon
his
head
take
he
said
the
symbol
of
fame
the
diadem
of
royalty
the
crown
the
empire
in
the
name
of
the
father
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
renounce
the
archfiend
and
all
sins
be
upright
and
merciful
and
live
in
such
pious
love
that
thou
mayest
hereafter
receive
the
everlasting
crown
in
company
with
the
saints
from
our
lord
jesus
christ
the
church
resounded
with
the
gloria
and
the
laudes
life
and
victory
to
the
emperor
to
the
roman
and
the
german
army
and
with
the
endless
acclamations
of
the
rude
soldiers
who
hailed
their
king
in
german
slav
and
romance
tongues
the
emperor
divested
himself
of
the
symbols
of
the
empire
and
now
ministered
to
the
pope
as
subdeacon
at
mass
the
count
palatine
afterward
removed
the
sandals
and
put
the
red
imperial
boots
with
the
spurs
of
maurice
upon
him
whereupon
the
entire
procession
accompanied
by
the
pope
left
the
church
and
advanced
along
the
triumphal
way
through
the
city
amid
the
ringing
of
all
the
bells
to
the
lateran
at
special
stations
were
posted
clergy
singing
praises
and
the
or
guilds
placed
to
salute
the
emperor
as
he
passed
chamberlains
scattered
money
before
and
behind
the
procession
and
all
the
scholæ
and
the
officials
of
the
palace
received
the
or
customary
present
of
money
a
banquet
closed
the
solemnities
in
the
papal
palace
such
are
merely
the
barest
outlines
of
an
imperial
coronation
of
this
period
the
ceremonies
borrowed
from
byzantine
pomp
had
been
established
since
charles
the
great
and
had
remained
essentially
the
same
although
in
the
course
of
time
many
details
had
been
altered
and
others
had
been
introduced
the
magnificence
of
these
spectacles
is
no
longer
rivalled
by
the
pageantry
of
our
days
the
multitudes
of
dukes
and
counts
of
bishops
and
abbots
knights
and
nobles
with
their
retinues
the
splendor
of
their
attire
the
strangeness
of
their
faces
and
their
tongues
the
martial
array
of
warriors
the
mystic
magnificence
of
the
papacy
with
all
its
orders
in
such
picturesque
costume
the
aspect
of
secular
rome
of
judges
and
senators
of
consuls
and
of
the
militia
with
their
banners
in
curious
motley
fantastic
attire
lastly
as
the
sublime
scene
of
the
drama
the
stern
gloomy
ruinous
city
through
which
the
procession
solemnly
advanced
all
combined
to
produce
a
picture
of
such
mighty
and
universal
historic
interest
that
even
a
roman
accustomed
to
the
pomp
of
period
could
not
have
beheld
it
without
feelings
of
astonishment
these
coronation
processions
restored
to
the
city
its
character
of
metropolis
the
romans
of
the
time
might
flatter
themselves
that
the
emperors
whom
they
elected
still
ruled
the
universe
the
strangers
who
flocked
to
the
city
freely
distributed
their
gold
and
the
hungry
populace
could
live
for
weeks
on
the
proceeds
of
the
coronation
darras
the
accession
of
gregory
vi
was
the
harbinger
of
an
epoch
of
moral
renaissance
the
wise
pontiff
whose
glory
it
had
been
to
free
the
church
from
a
disgraceful
yoke
proved
himself
worthy
of
the
sovereign
power
as
much
by
the
zeal
with
which
he
wielded
as
by
the
noble
disinterestedness
with
which
he
resigned
it
he
found
the
temporal
domains
of
the
church
so
far
diminished
that
they
hardly
furnished
the
pope
with
the
means
of
an
honorable
maintenance
as
guardian
of
the
rights
of
the
church
he
hurled
an
excommunication
against
the
usurpers
the
infuriated
plunderers
marched
upon
rome
with
an
armed
force
the
pope
also
raised
troops
took
possession
of
peter
church
drove
out
the
wretches
who
stole
the
offerings
laid
upon
the
tombs
of
the
apostles
took
back
several
estates
belonging
to
the
domain
of
the
church
and
secured
the
safety
of
the
roads
upon
which
pilgrims
no
longer
ventured
to
travel
except
in
caravans
this
policy
displeased
the
romans
who
had
now
become
habituated
to
plunder
their
complaints
induced
henry
iii
king
of
germany
to
hurry
to
italy
and
to
summon
a
council
at
sutri
during
the
christmas
festival
to
inquire
whether
the
election
of
gregory
should
be
regarded
as
simoniacal
the
pope
and
the
clergy
entertained
the
sincere
conviction
that
they
were
justified
in
bringing
about
even
by
means
of
money
the
abdication
of
the
unworthy
benedict
thus
to
end
the
scandal
which
so
foully
disgraced
the
holy
see
as
opinions
were
divided
on
this
point
gregory
vi
to
set
all
doubts
at
rest
stripped
himself
with
his
own
hands
of
the
pontifical
vestments
and
gave
up
to
the
bishops
his
pastoral
staff
having
given
to
the
world
this
noble
example
of
gregory
withdrew
to
the
monastery
of
cluny
bearing
with
him
the
consciousness
of
a
great
duty
done
he
died
in
that
holy
solitude
in
the
odor
of
sanctity
the
see
left
vacant
by
the
magnanimous
humility
of
gregory
vi
was
bestowed
by
general
consent
upon
suidger
bishop
of
bamberg
whom
king
henry
had
brought
with
him
to
rome
the
new
pope
whose
elevation
was
due
only
to
universally
known
and
acknowledged
virtues
took
the
name
of
clement
ii
and
was
crowned
on
in
the
same
solemnity
he
bestowed
the
imperial
title
and
crown
upon
henry
iii
and
his
queen
agnes
daughter
of
william
duke
of
aquitaine
the
emperor
henry
during
his
sojourn
in
rome
sent
for
peter
damian
to
assist
the
pope
by
his
counsels
the
illustrious
religious
thus
wrote
to
the
pontiff
in
excuse
for
not
complying
notwithstanding
the
emperor
request
so
expressive
of
his
benevolence
in
my
regard
i
can
not
devote
to
journeys
the
time
which
i
have
promised
to
consecrate
to
god
in
solitude
i
send
the
imperial
letter
in
order
that
your
holiness
may
decide
if
it
become
necessary
my
soul
is
weighed
down
with
grief
when
i
see
the
churches
of
our
provinces
plunged
into
shameful
confusion
through
the
fault
of
bad
bishops
and
abbots
what
does
it
profit
us
to
learn
that
the
holy
see
has
been
brought
out
from
darkness
into
the
light
if
we
still
remain
buried
in
the
same
gloom
of
ignominy
but
we
hope
that
you
are
destined
to
be
the
savior
of
israel
labor
then
most
holy
father
once
more
to
raise
up
the
kingdom
of
justice
and
use
the
vigor
of
discipline
to
humble
the
wicked
and
to
raise
the
courage
of
the
good
on
his
return
to
germany
henry
took
the
pope
with
him
the
city
of
beneventum
refused
to
open
its

in
henry
fanshawe
tozer
the
separation
of
the
eastern
and
western
churches
which
finally
took
place
in
the
year
was
due
to
the
operation
of
influences
which
had
been
at
work
for
several
centuries
before
from
very
early
times
a
tendency
to
divergence
existed
arising
from
the
tone
of
thought
of
the
dominant
races
in
the
two
the
more
speculative
greeks
being
chiefly
occupied
with
purely
theological
questions
while
the
more
practical
roman
mind
devoted
itself
rather
to
subjects
connected
with
the
nature
and
destiny
of
man
in
differences
such
as
these
there
was
nothing
irreconcilable
the
members
of
both
communions
professed
the
same
forms
of
belief
rested
their
faith
on
the
same
divine
persons
were
guided
by
the
same
standard
of
morals
and
were
animated
by
the
same
hopes
and
fears
and
they
were
bound
by
the
first
principles
of
their
religion
to
maintain
unity
with
one
another
but
in
societies
as
in
individuals
inherent
diversity
of
character
is
liable
to
be
intensified
by
time
and
thus
counteracts
the
natural
bonds
of
sympathy
and
prevents
the
two
sides
from
seeing
one
another
point
of
view
in
this
way
it
coöperates
with
and
aggravates
the
force
of
other
causes
of
disunion
which
adverse
circumstances
may
generate
such
causes
there
were
in
the
present
instance
political
ecclesiastical
and
theological
and
the
nature
of
these
it
may
be
well
for
us
to
consider
before
proceeding
to
narrate
the
history
of
the
disruption
the
office
of
bishop
of
rome
assumed
to
some
extent
a
political
character
as
early
as
the
time
of
the
first
christian
emperors
by
them
this
prelate
was
constituted
a
sort
of
secretary
of
state
for
christian
affairs
and
was
employed
as
a
central
authority
for
communicating
with
the
bishops
in
the
provinces
so
that
after
a
while
he
acted
as
minister
of
religion
and
public
instruction
as
the
civil
and
military
power
of
the
western
empire
declined
the
extent
of
this
authority
increased
and
by
the
time
when
italy
was
annexed
to
the
empire
of
the
east
in
the
reign
of
justinian
the
popes
had
become
the
political
chiefs
of
roman
society
nominally
indeed
they
were
subject
to
the
exarch
of
ravenna
as
vicegerent
of
the
emperor
at
constantinople
but
in
reality
the
inhabitants
of
western
europe
were
more
disposed
to
look
to
the
spiritual
potentate
in
the
imperial
city
as
representing
the
traditions
of
ancient
rome
the
political
rivalry
that
was
thus
engendered
was
sharpened
by
the
traditional
jealousy
of
rome
and
constantinople
which
had
existed
ever
since
the
new
capital
had
been
erected
on
the
shores
of
the
bosporus
then
followed
struggles
for
administrative
superiority
between
the
popes
and
the
exarchs
culminating
in
the
shameful
maltreatment
and
banishment
of
martin
i
by
the
emperor
constans
an
event
which
the
see
of
rome
could
never
forget
the
attempt
to
enforce
iconoclasm
in
central
italy
was
influential
in
causing
the
loss
of
that
province
to
the
empire
and
even
after
the
byzantine
rule
had
ceased
there
the
controversy
about
images
tended
to
keep
alive
the
antagonism
because
although
that
question
was
once
and
again
settled
in
favor
of
the
maintenance
of
images
yet
many
of
the
emperors
in
whose
persons
the
power
of
the
east
was
embodied
were
foremost
in
advocating
their
destruction
indeed
from
first
to
last
owing
to
the
close
connection
of
church
and
state
in
the
byzantine
empire
the
unpopularity
of
the
latter
in
western
europe
was
shared
by
the
former
to
this
must
be
added
the
contempt
for
one
character
which
had
arisen
among
the
adherents
of
the
two
churches
for
the
easterns
had
learned
to
regard
the
people
of
the
west
as
ignorant
and
barbarous
and
were
esteemed
by
them
in
turn
as
mendacious
and
unmanly
in
ecclesiastical
matters
also
the
differences
were
of
long
standing
these
related
to
questions
of
jurisdiction
between
the
two
patriarchates
up
to
the
eighth
century
the
patriarchate
of
the
west
included
a
number
of
provinces
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
adriatic
illyricum
dacia
macedonia
and
greece
but
leo
the
isaurian
who
probably
foresaw
that
italy
would
ere
long
cease
to
form
part
of
his
dominions
and
was
unwilling
that
these
important
territories
should
own
spiritual
allegiance
to
one
who
was
not
his
subject
altered
this
arrangement
and
transferred
the
jurisdiction
over
them
to
the
patriarch
of
constantinople
against
this
measure
the
bishops
of
rome
did
not
fail
to
protest
and
demands
for
their
restoration
were
made
up
to
the
time
of
the
final
schism
a
further
ecclesiastical
question
which
in
part
depended
on
this
was
that
of
the
church
of
the
bulgarians
the
prince
bogoris
had
swayed
to
and
fro
in
his
inclinations
between
the
two
churches
and
had
ultimately
given
his
allegiance
to
that
of
the
east
but
the
controversy
did
not
end
there
according
to
the
ancient
territorial
arrangement
the
danubian
provinces
were
made
subject
to
the
archbishopric
of
thessalonica
and
that
city
was
included
within
the
western
patriarchate
and
on
this
ground
bulgaria
was
claimed
by
the
roman
see
as
falling
within
that
area
the
matter
was
several
times
pressed
on
the
attention
of
the
greek
church
especially
on
the
occasion
of
the
council
held
at
constantinople
in
but
in
vain
the
eastern
prelates
replied
evasively
saying
that
to
determine
the
boundaries
of
dioceses
was
a
matter
which
belonged
to
the
sovereign
the
emperor
for
his
part
had
good
reason
for
not
yielding
for
by
so
doing
he
would
not
only
have
admitted
into
a
neighboring
country
an
agency
which
would
soon
have
been
employed
for
political
purposes
to
his
disadvantage
but
would
have
justified
the
assumption
on
which
the
demand
rested
that
the
pope
had
a
right
to
claim
the
provinces
which
his
predecessors
had
lost
thus
this
point
of
difference
also
remained
open
as
a
source
of
irritation
between
the
two
churches
but
behind
these
questions
another
of
far
greater
magnitude
was
coming
into
view
that
of
the
papal
supremacy
from
being
in
the
first
instance
the
head
of
the
christian
church
in
the
old
imperial
city
and
afterward
patriarch
of
the
west
and
inter
in
relation
to
the
other
spiritual
heads
of
christendom
the
bishop
of
rome
had
gradually
claimed
on
the
strength
of
his
occupying
the
a
position
which
approximated
more
and
more
to
that
of
supremacy
over
the
whole
church
this
claim
had
never
been
admitted
in
the
east
but
the
appeals
which
were
made
from
constantinople
to
his
judgment
and
authority
both
at
the
time
of
the
iconoclastic
controversy
and
subsequently
lent
some
countenance
to
its
validity
but
the
great
advance
was
made
in
the
pontificate
of
nicholas
i
who
promulgated
or
at
least
recognized
the
this
famous
compilation
which
is
now
universally
acknowledged
to
be
spurious
and
can
be
shown
to
be
the
work
of
that
period
contains
among
other
documents
letters
and
decrees
of
the
early
bishops
of
rome
in
which
the
organization
and
discipline
of
the
church
from
the
earliest
time
are
set
forth
and
the
whole
system
is
shown
to
have
depended
on
the
supremacy
of
the
popes
the
newly
discovered
collection
was
recognized
as
genuine
by
nicholas
and
was
accepted
by
the
western
church
the
effect
of
this
was
at
once
to
formulate
all
the
claims
which
had
before
been
vaguely
asserted
and
to
give
them
the
authority
of
unbroken
tradition
the
result
to
christendom
at
large
was
in
the
highest
degree
momentous
it
was
impossible
for
future
popes
to
recede
from
them
and
equally
impossible
for
other
churches
which
valued
their
independence
to
acknowledge
them
the
last
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
eastern
church
to
arrange
a
compromise
in
this
matter
was
made
by
the
emperor
basil
ii
a
potentate
who
both
by
his
conquests
and
the
vigor
of
his
administration
might
rightly
claim
to
negotiate
with
others
on
equal
terms
by
him
it
was
proposed
that
the
eastern
church
should
recognize
the
honorary
primacy
of
the
western
patriarch
and
that
he
in
turn
should
acknowledge
the
internal
independence
of
the
eastern
church
these
terms
were
rejected
and
from
that
moment
it
was
clear
that
the
separation
of
the
two
branches
of
christendom
was
only
a
question
of
time
already
in
the
papacy
of
nicholas
i
a
rupture
had
occurred
in
connection
with
the
dispute
between
the
rival
patriarchs
of
constantinople
ignatius
and
photius
the
former
of
these
prelates
who
was
son
of
the
emperor
michael
i
and
a
man
of
high
character
and
a
devout
opponent
of
iconoclasm
was
appointed
through
the
influence
of
theodora
the
restorer
of
images
in
the
reign
of
her
son
michael
the
drunkard
but
the
uncle
of
the
emperor
the
caesar
bardas
who
was
a
man
of
flagrantly
immoral
life
had
divorced
his
own
wife
and
was
living
publicly
with
his
son
widow
for
this
incestuous
connection
ignatius
repelled
him
from
the
communion
fired
with
indignation
at
this
insult
the
caesar
determined
to
ruin
both
the
patriarch
and
his
patroness
the
and
with
this
view
persuaded
the
emperor
to
free
himself
from
the
trammels
of
his
mother
influence
by
forcing
her
to
take
monastic
vows
to
this
step
ignatius
would
not
consent
because
it
was
forbidden
by
the
laws
of
the
church
that
any
should
enter
on
the
monastic
life
except
of
their
own
free
will
in
consequence
of
his
resistance
a
charge
of
treasonable
correspondence
was
invented
against
him
and
when
he
refused
to
resign
his
office
he
was
deposed
photius
who
was
chosen
to
succeed
him
was
the
most
learned
man
of
his
age
and
like
his
rival
unblemished
in
character
and
a
supporter
of
images
but
boundless
in
ambition
he
was
a
layman
at
the
time
of
his
appointment
but
in
six
days
he
passed
through
the
inferior
orders
which
led
up
to
the
patriarchate
still
the
party
that
remained
faithful
to
ignatius
numbered
many
adherents
and
therefore
photius
thought
it
well
to
enlist
the
support
of
the
bishop
of
rome
on
his
side
an
embassy
was
therefore
sent
to
inform
pope
nicholas
that
the
late
patriarch
had
voluntarily
retired
and
that
photius
had
been
lawfully
chosen
and
had
undertaken
the
office
with
great
reluctance
in
answer
to
this
appeal
the
pope
despatched
two
legates
to
constantinople
and
ignatius
was
summoned
to
appear
before
a
council
at
which
they
were
present
he
was
condemned
but
appealed
to
the
pope
in
person
on
the
return
of
the
legates
to
rome
it
was
discovered
that
they
had
received
bribes
and
thereupon
nicholas
whose
judgment
however
imperious
was
ever
on
the
side
of
the
oppressed
called
together
a
synod
of
the
roman
church
and
refused
his
consent
to
the
deposition
of
ignatius
to
this
effect
he
wrote
to
the
authorities
of
the
eastern
church
calling
upon
them
at
the
same
time
to
concur
in
the
decrees
of
the
apostolic
see
but
subsequently
having
obtained
full
information
as
to
the
harsh
treatment
to
which
the
deposed
patriarch
had
been
subjected
he
excommunicated
photius
and
commanded
the
restoration
of
ignatius
by
the
power
committed
to
him
by
christ
through
st
peter
these
denunciations
produced
no
effect
on
the
emperor
and
the
new
patriarch
and
a
correspondence
between
michael
and
nicholas
couched
in
violent
language
continued
at
intervals
for
several
years
at
last
in
consequence
of
a
renewed
demand
on
the
part
of
the
pope
that
ignatius
and
photius
should
be
sent
to
rome
for
judgment
the
latter
prelate
whose
ability
and
eloquence
had
obtained
great
influence
for
him
summoned
a
council
at
constantinople
in
the
year
to
decree
the
of
the
western
patriarch
of
the
eight
articles
which
were
drawn
up
on
this
occasion
for
the
incrimination
of
the
church
of
rome
all
but
two
relate
to
trivial
matters
such
as
the
observance
of
saturday
as
a
fast
and
the
shaving
of
their
beards
by
the
clergy
the
two
important
ones
deal
with
the
doctrine
of
the
procession
of
the
holy
spirit
and
the
enforced
celibacy
of
the
clergy
the
condemnation
of
the
western
church
on
these
grounds
was
voted
and
a
messenger
was
despatched
to
bear
the
defiance
to
rome
but
ere
he
reached
his
destination
he
was
recalled
in
consequence
of
a
revolution
in
the
palace
at
constantinople
the
author
of
this
basil
the
macedonian
the
founder
of
the
most
important
dynasty
that
ever
occupied
the
throne
of
the
eastern
empire
had
for
some
time
been
associated
in
the
government
with
the
emperor
michael
but
at
length
being
fearful
for
his
own
safety
he
resolved
to
put
his
colleague
out
of
the
way
and
assassinated
him
during
one
of
his
fits
of
drunkenness
it
is
said
that
in
consequence
of
this
crime
photius
refused
to
admit
him
to
the
communion
anyhow
one
of
the
first
acts
of
basil
was
to
depose
photius
a
council
hostile
to
him
was
now
assembled
and
was
attended
by
the
legates
of
the
new
pope
hadrian
ii
by
this
ignatius
was
restored
to
his
former
dignity
while
photius
was
degraded
and
his
ordinations
were
declared
void
so
violent
was
the
animosity
displayed
against
him
that
he
was
dragged
before
the
assembly
by
the
emperor
guard
and
his
condemnation
was
written
in
the
sacramental
wine
during
the
ten
years
which
elapsed
between
his
restoration
and
his
death
ignatius
continued
to
enjoy
his
high
position
in
peace
but
for
photius
other
vicissitudes
were
in
store
on
the
removal
of
his
rival
so
strangely
did
opinion
sway
to
and
fro
at
this
time
in
the
empire
the
current
of
feeling
set
strongly
in
favor
of
the
learned
exile
he
was
recalled
and
his
reinstatement
was
ratified
by
a
council
but
with
the
death
of
basil
the
macedonian
he
again
fell
from
power
for
the
successor
of
that
emperor
leo
the
philosopher
ignominiously
removed
him
in
order
to
confer
the
dignity
on
his
brother
stephen
he
passed
the
remainder
of
his
life
in
honorable
retirement
and
by
his
death
the
chief
obstacle
in
the
way
of
reconcilement
with
the
roman
church
was
removed
it
is
consoling
to
learn
when
reading
of
the
unhappy
rivalry
of
the
two
men
so
superior
to
the
ordinary
run
of
byzantine
prelates
that
they
never
shared
the
passions
of
their
respective
partisans
but
retained
a
mutual
regard
for
one
another
we
have
now
to
consider
the
doctrinal
questions
which
were
in
dispute
between
the
two
churches
far
the
most
important
of
these
was
that
relating
to
the
addition
of
the
clause
to
the
nicene
creed
in
the
first
draft
of
the
creed
as
promulgated
by
the
council
of
nicaea
the
article
relating
to
the
holy
spirit
ran
simply
thus
i
believe
in
the
holy
ghost
but
in
the
second
general
council
that
of
constantinople
which
condemned
the
heresy
of
macedonius
it
was
thought
advisable
to
state
more
explicitly
the
doctrine
of
the
church
on
this
subject
and
among
other
affirmations
the
clause
was
added
who
proceedeth
from
the
father
again
at
the
next
general
council
at
ephesus
it
was
ordered
that
it
should
not
be
lawful
to
make
any
addition
to
the
creed
as
ratified
by
the
council
of
constantinople
the
followers
of
the
western
church
however
generally
taught
that
the
spirit
proceeds
from
the
son
as
well
as
from
the
father
while
those
of
the
east
preferred
to
use
the
expression
the
spirit
of
christ
proceeding
from
the
father
and
receiving
of
the
son
or
proceeding
from
the
father
through
the
son
it
was
in
the
churches
of
spain
and
france
that
the
clause
was
first
introduced
into
the
creed
and
thus
recited
in
the
services
but
the
addition
was
not
at
once
approved
at
rome
pope
leo
iii
early
in
the
ninth
century
not
only
expressed
his
disapproval
of
this
departure
from
the
original
form
but
in
order
to
show
his
sense
of
the
importance
of
adhering
to
the
traditional
practice
caused
the
creed
of
constantinople
to
be
engraved
on
silver
plates
both
in
greek
and
latin
and
thus
to
be
publicly
set
forth
in
the
church
the
first
pontiff
who
authorized
the
addition
was
nicholas
i
and
against
this
photius
protested
both
during
the
lifetime
of
that
pope
and
also
in
the
time
of
john
viii
when
it
was
condemned
by
the
council
held
at
constantinople
in
which
is
called
by
the
greeks
the
eighth
general
council
it
is
clear
from
what
we
have
already
seen
that
photius
was
prepared
to
seize
on
point
of
disagreement
in
order
to
throw
it
in
the
teeth
of
his
opponents
but
in
this
matter
the
eastern
church
had
a
real
grievance
to
complain
of
the
nicene
creed
was
to
them
what
it
was
not
to
the
western
church
their
only
creed
and
the
authority
of
the
councils
by
which
its
form
and
wording
were
determined
stood
far
higher
in
their
estimation
to
add
to
the
one
and
to
disregard
the
other
were
at
least
in
their
judgment
the
violation
of
a
sacred
compact
the
other
question
which
if
not
actually
one
of
doctrine
had
come
to
be
regarded
as
such
was
that
of
the
that
is
the
use
of
unfermented
bread
in
the
celebration
of
the
eucharist
as
far
as
one
can
judge
from
the
doubtful
evidence
on
the
subject
it
seems
probable
that
ordinary
that
is
leavened
bread
was
generally
used
in
the
church
for
this
purpose
until
the
seventh
or
eighth
century
when
unleavened
bread
began
to
be
employed
in
the
west
on
the
ground
that
it
was
used
in
the
original
institution
of
the
sacrament
which
took
place
during
the
feast
of
the
passover
in
the
eastern
church
this
change
was
never
admitted
it
seems
strange
that
so
insignificant
a
matter
of
observance
should
have
been
erected
into
a
question
of
the
first
importance
between
the
two
communions
but
the
reason
of
this
is
not
far
to
seek
the
fact
is
that
whereas
the
weighty
matters
of
dispute
the
doctrine
of
the
procession
of
the
holy
spirit
and
the
papal
claims
to
supremacy
required
some
knowledge
and
reflection
in
order
rightly
to
understand
their
bearings
the
use
of
leavened
or
unleavened
bread
was
a
matter
within
the
range
of
all
and
those
who
were
on
the
lookout
for
a
ground
of
antagonism
found
it
here
ready
to
hand
in
the
story
of
the
conversion
of
the
russian
vladimir
we
are
told
that
the
greek
missionary
who
expounded
to
him
the
religious
views
of
the
eastern
church
when
combating
the
claims
of
the
emissaries
of
the
roman
communion
remarked
they
celebrate
the
mass
with
unleavened
bread
therefore
they
have
not
the
true
religion
still
even
photius
when
raking
together
the
most
minute
points
of
difference
between
him
and
his
adversaries
did
not
introduce
this
one
it
was
reserved
for
a
partisan
at
a
later
period
to
bring
forward
as
a
subject
of
public
discussion
this
was
michael
cerularius
patriarch
of
constantinople
with
whose
name
the
great
schism
will
forever
be
associated
the
circumstances
which
led
up
to
that
event
are
as
follows
for
a
century
and
a
half
from
the
death
of
photius
the
controversy
slumbered
though
no
advance
was
made
toward
an
understanding
with
respect
to
the
points
at
issue
in
italy
and
even
at
rome
churches
and
monasteries
were
tolerated
in
which
the
greek
rite
was
maintained
and
similar
freedom
was
allowed
to
the
latins
resident
in
the
greek
empire
but
this
tacit
compact
was
broken
in
by
the
patriarch
michael
who
in
his
passionate
antagonism
to
everything
western
gave
orders
that
all
the
churches
in
constantinople
in
which
worship
was
celebrated
according
to
the
roman
rite
should
be
closed
at
the
same
time
aroused
perhaps
in
some
measure
by
the
progress
of
the
normans
in
conquering
apulia
which
tended
to
interfere
with
the
jurisdiction
still
exercised
by
the
eastern
church
in
that
province
he
joined
with
leo
the
archbishop
of
achrida
and
metropolitan
of
bulgaria
in
addressing
a
letter
to
the
bishop
of
trani
in
southern
italy
containing
a
violent
attack
on
the
latin
church
in
which
the
question
of
the
azyma
was
put
prominently
forward
directions
were
further
given
for
circulating
this
missive
among
the
western
clergy
it
happened
that
at
the
time
when
the
letter
arrived
at
trani
cardinal
humbert
a
vigorous
champion
of
ecclesiastical
rights
was
residing
in
that
city
and
he
translated
it
into
latin
and
communicated
it
to
pope
leo
ix
in
answer
the
pope
addressed
a
remonstrance
to
the
patriarch
in
which
without
entering
into
the
specific
charges
that
he
had
brought
forward
he
contrasted
the
security
of
the
roman
see
in
matters
of
doctrine
arising
from
the
guidance
which
was
guaranteed
to
it
through
peter
with
the
liability
of
the
eastern
church
to
fall
into
error
and
pointedly
referred
to
the
more
christian
spirit
manifested
by
his
own
communion
in
tolerating
those
from
whose
opinions
they
differed
afterward
at
the
commencement
of
in
compliance
with
a
request
from
the
emperor
constantine
monomachus
who
was
anxious
on
political
grounds
to
avoid
a
rupture
he
sent
three
legates
to
constantinople
to
arrange
the
terms
of
an
agreement
these
were
frederick
of
lorraine
chancellor
of
the
roman
church
peter
archbishop
of
amalfi
and
cardinal
humbert
the
legates
were
welcomed
by
the
emperor
but
they
unwisely
adopted
a
lofty
tone
toward
the
haughty
patriarch
who
thenceforward
avoided
all
communication
with
them
declaring
that
on
a
matter
which
so
seriously
affected
the
whole
eastern
church
he
could
take
no
steps
without
consulting
the
other
patriarchs
humbert
now
published
an
argumentative
reply
to
michael
letter
to
the
pope
in
the
form
of
a
dialogue
between
two
members
of
the
greek
and
latin
churches
in
which
the
charges
brought
against
his
own
communion
were
discussed
and
especially
those
relating
to
fasting
on
saturday
and
the
use
of
unleavened
bread
in
the
eucharist
a
rejoinder
to
this
appeared
from
the
pen
of
a
monk
of
the
monastery
of
studium
nicetas
pectoratus
in
which
the
enforced
celibacy
of
the
western
clergy
on
which
photius
had
before
animadverted
was
severely
criticised
the
cardinal
retorted
in
intemperate
language
and
so
entirely
had
the
legates
secured
the
support
of
constantine
that
nicetas
work
was
committed
to
the
flames
and
he
was
forced
to
recant
what
he
had
said
against
the
roman
church
but
the
patriarch
was
immovable
and
for
the
moment
he
occupied
a
stronger
position
than
the
emperor
who
desired
to
conciliate
him
at
last
the
patience
of
the
legates
was
exhausted
and
on
july
they
proceeded
to
the
church
of
sophia
and
deposited
on
the
altar
which
was
prepared
for
the
celebration
of
the
eucharist
a
document
containing
a
fierce
anathema
by
which
michael
cerularius
and
his
adherents
were
condemned
after
their
departure
they
were
for
a
moment
recalled
because
the
patriarch
expressed
a
desire
to
confer
with
them
but
this
constantine
would
not
permit
fearing
some
act
of
violence
on
the
part
of
the
people
they
then
finally
left
constantinople
and
from
that
time
to
the
present
all
communion
has
been
broken
off
between
the
two
great
branches
of
christendom
the
breach
thus
made
was
greatly
widened
at
the
period
of
the
crusades
however
serious
may
have
been
the
alienation
between
the
east
and
west
at
the
time
of
their
separation
it
is
clear
that
the
greeks
were
not
regarded
by
the
latins
as
a
mere
heretical
sect
for
one
of
the
primary
objects
with
which
the
first
crusade
was
undertaken
was
the
deliverance
of
the
eastern
empire
from
the
attacks
of
the
mahometans
but
the
familiarity
which
arose
from
the
presence
of
the
crusaders
on
greek
soil
ripened
the
seeds
of
mutual
dislike
and
distrust
as
long
as
negotiations
between
the
two
parties
took
place
at
a
distance
the
differences
however
irreconcilable
they
might
be
in
principle
did
not
necessarily
bring
them
into
open
antagonism
whereas
their
more
intimate
acquaintance
with
one
another
produced
personal
and
national
the
people
of
the
west
now
appeared
more
than
ever
barbarous
and
overbearing
and
the
court
of
constantinople
more
than
ever
senile
and
designing
the
crafty
policy
of
alexius
comnenus
in
transferring
his
allies
with
all
speed
into
asia
and
declining
to
take
the
lead
in
the
expedition
was
almost
justified
by
the
necessity
of
delivering
his
subjects
from
these
unwelcome
visitors
and
avoiding
further
embarrassments
but
the
iniquitous
fourth
crusade
produced
an
ineradicable
feeling
of
animosity
in
the
minds
of
the
byzantine
people
the
memory
of
the
barbarities
of
that
time
when
many
greeks
died
as
martyrs
at
the
stake
for
their
religious
convictions
survives
at
the
present
day
in
various
places
bordering
on
the
aegean
in
legends
which
relate
that
they
were
formerly
destroyed
by
the
pope
of
rome
still
the
anxiety
of
the
eastern
emperors
to
maintain
their
position
by
means
of
political
support
from
western
europe
brought
it
to
pass
that
proposals
for
reunion
were
made
on
several
occasions
the
final
attempt
at
reconciliation
was
made
when
the
greek
empire
was
reduced
to
the
direst
straits
and
its
rulers
were
prepared
to
purchase
the
aid
of
western
europe
against
the
ottomans
by
almost
any
sacrifice
accordingly
application
was
made
to
pope
eugenius
iv
and
by
him
the
representatives
of
the
eastern
church
were
invited
to
attend
the
council
which
was
summoned
to
meet
at
ferrara
in
the
emperor
john
palaeologus
and
the
greek
patriarch
joseph
proceeded
thither
the
emperor
however
on
his
return
home
soon
discovered
that
his
pilgrimage
to
the
west
had
been
lost
labor
pope
eugenius
indeed
provided
him
with
two
galleys
and
a
guard
of
three
hundred
men
equipped
at
his
own
expense
but
the
succors
from
western
europe
did
not
arrive
his
own
subjects
were
completely
alienated
by
the
betrayal
of
their
cherished
faith
the
clergy
who
favored
the
union
were
regarded
as
traitors
john
palaeologus
himself
did
not
survive
to
see
the
final
catastrophe
but
constantinople
was
captured
by
the
turks
and
the
empire
of
the
east
ceased
to
exist
joseph
deharbe
the
bonds
so
often
and
so
painfully
knit
between
the
eastern
and
western
churches
were
destined
at
last
to
be
completely
torn
asunder
and
the
truth
of
our
lord
words
who
is
not
for
me
is
against
me
was
again
to
be
proved
the
greek
schism
places
strikingly
before
our
eyes
the
fate
of
such
churches
as
supinely
yield
their
rights
and
independence
and
submit
willingly
to
state
tyranny
in
the
year
the
wicked
bardas
uncle
to
the
reigning
emperor
who
wielded
an
almost
absolute
power
and
disregarded
all
laws
human
and
divine
unjustly
banished
from
his
see
ignatius
the
rightful
patriarch
of
constantinople
and
placed
in
his
stead
the
learned
but
worthless
photius
such
bishops
as
refused
to
recognize
the
intruder
who
had
received
all
the
orders
in
six
days
from
an
excommunicated
bishop
were
deposed
imprisoned
and
exiled
photius
tried
by
cruel
to
force
the
aged
ignatius
to
abdicate
and
by
a
fabrication
endeavored
to
obtain
the
support
of
pope
nicholas
i
when
however
this
great
pope
learned
the
true
facts
of
the
case
from
the
imprisoned
ignatius
he
assembled
a
synod
in
rome
in
by
which
photius
and
all
the
bishops
whom
he
had
consecrated
were
deposed
fired
by
ambition
photius
now
threw
off
all
concealments
he
summoned
the
bishops
of
his
own
party
laid
various
charges
against
the
roman
church
and
in
his
inconsiderate
rage
ended
by
anathematising
the
holy
father
pope
nicholas
in
a
most
powerful
letter
exhorted
the
emperor
michael
iii
to
set
bounds
to
the
disorders
of
photius
warning
him
that
a
fearful
judgment
would
await
him
if
the
faithful
were
misled
and
so
many
believers
caused
to
swerve
from
the
right
path
it
was
not
however
till
the
reign
of
his
successor
that
photius
was
banished
and
the
ignatius
restored
to
his
rights
to
remedy
the
evil
brought
about
by
photius
the
eighth
general
council
was
held
in
constantinople
at
the
desire
of
ignatius
and
the
emperor
and
presided
over
by
the
legates
of
pope
adrian
photius
when
called
upon
to
answer
for
himself
having
nothing
to
say
in
his
own
defence
excused
his
silence
by
the
example
of
our
lord
who
also
was
silent
when
accused
the
fathers
were
filled
with
indignation
at
this
blasphemous
speech
and
his
guilt
having
been
fully
proved
they
cried
unanimously
anathema
on
photius
promoted
through
court
favor
anathema
to
the
tyrant
photius
to
the
inventor
of
lies
to
the
new
judas
anathema
on
all
his
followers
and
protectors
everlasting
glory
to
the
most
holy
roman
pope
nicholas
long
life
to
adrian
the
holy
father
in
rome
at
the
next
sitting
of
the
council
a
collection
of
spurious
and
falsified
writings
together
with
the
acts
of
the
synod
which
photius
had
held
against
pope
nicholas
and
which
were
filled
with
lies
and
invective
and
had
forged
signatures
appended
to
them
were
publicly
burned
in
the
church
but
hardly
had
ignatius
died
in
the
year
when
the
crafty
photius
who
knew
well
how
to
ingratiate
himself
with
the
emperor
reascended
the
chair
and
began
afresh
his
old
courses
his
rule
did
not
last
long
he
was
again
deposed
and
banished
to
a
monastery
where
he
died
about
the
year
his
death
however
in
nowise
healed
the
wounds
which
he
had
inflicted
on
the
eastern
church
his
party
survived
him
he
had
filled
most
of
the
greek
sees
with
men
of
his
own
cast
and
had
illegally
bestowed
benefices
on
great
numbers
of
priests
these
all
harbored
a
dislike
towards
rome
and
only
awaited
a
favorable
opportunity
to
renew
the
breach
with
her
thus
that
sectarian
spirit
which
photius
had
kindled
continued
to
smoulder
on
like
a
spark
beneath
the
ashes
and
spread
itself
wider
and
wider
as
well
among
the
worst
sort
of
the
clergy
as
among
the
fickle
and
discontented
population
it
was
after
all
this
that
the
patriarchs
of
constantinople
attempted
to
make
themselves
fully
independent
of
the
west
the
splendor
of
the
imperial
city
of
byzantium
was
a
constant
incitement
to
their
desire
for
freedom
and
they
were
certain
for
the
most
part
of
being
supported
in
their
endeavors
by
the
emperors
as
early
as
the
time
of
pope
gregory
the
great
the
patriarch
john
the
faster
had
taken
on
himself
the
title
of
oecumenical
or
universal
bishop
whilst
gregory
in
apostolic
humility
chose
that
of
servant
of
the
servants
of
god
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
eleventh
century
that
a
complete
separation
was
accomplished
the
universally
recognized
precedence
of
the
see
of
peter
was
intolerable
to
the
ambitious
spirit
of
the
patriarch
michael
cerularius
to
aid
him
in
casting
off
the
hated
yoke
he
circulated
like
photius
a
document
in
which
the
western
church
was
loaded
with
invective
and
all
manner
of
accusations
laid
to
her
charge
the
celibacy
of
the
secular
clergy
the
use
of
unleavened
bread
for
the
sacrifice
fasting
on
saturdays
the
shaving
of
beards
the
omission
of
the
alleluia
in
lent
were
all
brought
forward
as
causes
of
offence
these
complaints
were
at
once
answered
by
pope
leo
ix
who
tried
in
a
most
eloquent
letter
to
bring
the
deluded
patriarch
to
reason
he
reminded
him
of
the
sanctity
and
inviolability
of
the
unity
of
church
the
folly
and
presumption
of
his
attempting
to
direct
the
successor
of
peter
whom
christ
had
himself
confirmed
in
the
faith
and
pointed
out
to
him
with
what
ingratitude
and
contempt
he
was
treating
the
roman
church
the
mother
and
guardian
of
all
the
churches
lastly
he
urged
upon
the
patriarch
to
set
aside
all
discord
and
pride
and
to
allow
divine
mercy
and
peace
to
prevail
instead
of
strife
but
the
paternal
words
were
spoken
in
vain
and
the
legates
also
who
were
sent
by
the
pope
to
constantinople
were
powerless
to
move
the
obduracy
of
the
patriarch
he
persistently
refused
all
communication
with
them
by
speech
or
writing
having
therefore
formally
laid
their
complaints
in
the
most
distinct
terms
before
the
emperor
and
senate
they
proceeded
to
extremities
on
the
of
july
they
appeared
in
the
church
of
sophia
at
the
beginning
of
divine
service
and
declared
solemnly
that
all
their
endeavors
to
peace
and
union
had
been
defeated
by
cerularius
they
then
laid
the
bull
of
excommunication
on
the
high
altar
and
left
the
church
shaking
as
they
did
so
the
dust
from
off
their
feet
and
exclaiming
in
the
deepest
grief
god
sees
it
he
will
judge

and
formidable
armament

western
nations
had
witnessed
with

he
entered
upon
an
undertaking

speedy
and
complete
success

which
in

and
decisive
battle

was
fruitful
in
historic
results

no

of
england
and

upon

destinies
of
the

will
ever
rank
that
victory
as
one
of
secondary
importance
all
the
adventurous
spirits
of
christendom
flocked
to
the
holy
banner
under
which
duke
william
the
most
renowned
knight
and
sagest
general
of
the
age
promised
to
lead
them
to
glory
and
wealth
in
the
fair
domains
of
england
his
army
was
filled
with
the
chivalry
of
continental
europe
all
eager
to
save
their
souls
by
fighting
at
the
pope
bidding
eager
to
signalize
their
valor
in
so
great
an
enterprise
and
eager
also
for
the
pay
and
the
plunder
which
william
liberally
promised
but
the
normans
themselves
were
the
pith
and
the
flower
of
the
army
and
william
himself
was
the
strongest
the
sagest
and
the
fiercest
spirit
of
them
all
throughout
the
spring
and
summer
of
all
the
seaports
of
normandy
picardy
and
brittany
rang
with
the
busy
sound
of
preparation
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
channel
king
harold
collected
the
army
and
the
fleet
with
which
he
hoped
to
crush
the
southern
invaders
but
the
unexpected
attack
of
king
harald
hardrada
of
norway
upon
another
part
of
england
disconcerted
the
skilful
measures
which
the
saxon
had
taken
against
the
menacing
armada
of
duke
william
harold
renegade
brother
earl
tostig
had
excited
the
norse
king
to
this
enterprise
the
importance
of
which
has
naturally
been
eclipsed
by
the
superior
interest
attached
to
the
victorious
expedition
of
duke
william
but
which
was
on
a
scale
of
grandeur
which
the
scandinavian
ports
had
rarely
if
ever
before
witnessed
hardrada
fleet
consisted
of
two
hundred
warships
and
three
hundred
other
vessels
and
all
the
best
warriors
of
norway
were
in
his
host
he
sailed
first
to
the
orkneys
where
many
of
the
islanders
joined
him
and
then
to
yorkshire
after
a
severe
conflict
near
york
he
completely
routed
earls
edwin
and
morcar
the
governors
of
northumbria
the
city
of
york
opened
its
gates
and
all
the
country
from
the
tyne
to
the
humber
submitted
to
him
the
tidings
of
the
defeat
of
edwin
and
morcar
compelled
harold
to
leave
his
position
on
the
southern
coast
and
move
instantly
against
the
norwegians
by
a
remarkably
rapid
march
he
reached
yorkshire
in
four
days
and
took
the
norse
king
and
his
confederates
by
surprise
nevertheless
the
battle
which
ensued
and
which
was
fought
near
stamford
bridge
was
desperate
and
was
long
doubtful
unable
to
break
the
ranks
of
the
norwegian
phalanx
by
force
harold
at
length
tempted
them
to
quit
their
close
order
by
a
pretended
flight
then
the
english
columns
burst
in
among
them
and
a
carnage
ensued
the
extent
of
which
may
be
judged
of
by
the
exhaustion
and
inactivity
of
norway
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
afterward
king
harald
hardrada
and
all
the
flower
of
his
nobility
perished
on
the
of
september
at
stamford
bridge
a
battle
which
was
a
flodden
to
norway
harold
victory
was
splendid
but
he
had
bought
it
dearly
by
the
fall
of
many
of
his
best
officers
and
men
and
still
more
dearly
by
the
opportunity
which
duke
william
had
gained
of
effecting
an
unopposed
landing
on
the
sussex
coast
the
whole
of
william
shipping
had
assembled
at
the
mouth
of
the
dive
a
little
river
between
the
seine
and
the
orne
as
early
as
the
middle
of
august
the
army
which
he
had
collected
amounted
to
fifty
thousand
knights
and
ten
thousand
soldiers
of
inferior
degree
many
of
the
knights
were
mounted
but
many
must
have
served
on
foot
as
it
is
hardly
possible
to
believe
that
william
could
have
found
transports
for
the
conveyance
of
fifty
thousand
across
the
channel
for
a
long
time
the
winds
were
adverse
and
the
duke
employed
the
interval
that
passed
before
he
could
set
sail
in
completing
the
organization
in
and
improving
the
discipline
of
his
army
which
he
seems
to
have
brought
into
the
same
state
of
perfection
as
was
seven
centuries
and
a
half
afterward
the
boast
of
another
army
assembled
on
the
same
coast
and
which
napoleon
designed
for
a
similar
descent
upon
england
it
was
not
till
the
approach
of
the
equinox
that
the
wind
veered
from
the
northeast
to
the
west
and
gave
the
normans
an
opportunity
of
quitting
the
weary
shores
of
the
dive
they
eagerly
embarked
and
set
sail
but
the
wind
soon
freshened
to
a
gale
and
drove
them
along
the
french
coast
to
valery
where
the
greater
part
of
them
found
shelter
but
many
of
their
vessels
were
wrecked
and
the
whole
coast
of
normandy
was
strewn
with
the
bodies
of
the
drowned
william
army
began
to
grow
discouraged
and
averse
to
the
enterprise
which
the
very
elements
thus
seemed
to
fight
against
though
in
reality
the
northeast
wind
which
had
cooped
them
so
long
at
the
mouth
of
the
dive
and
the
western
gale
which
had
forced
them
into
valery
were
the
best
possible
friends
to
the
invaders
they
prevented
the
normans
from
crossing
the
channel
until
the
saxon
king
and
his
army
of
defence
had
been
called
away
from
the
sussex
coast
to
encounter
harald
hardrada
in
yorkshire
and
also
until
a
formidable
english
fleet
which
by
king
harold
orders
had
been
cruising
in
the
channel
to
intercept
the
normans
had
been
obliged
to
disperse
temporarily
for
the
purpose
of
refitting
and
taking
in
fresh
stores
of
provisions
duke
william
used
every
expedient
to
reanimate
the
drooping
spirits
of
his
men
at
valery
and
at
last
he
caused
the
body
of
the
patron
saint
of
the
place
to
be
exhumed
and
carried
in
solemn
procession
while
the
whole
assemblage
of
soldiers
mariners
and
appurtenant
priests
implored
the
saint
intercession
for
a
change
of
wind
that
very
night
the
wind
veered
and
enabled
the
mediaeval
agamemnon
to
quit
his
aulis
with
full
sails
and
a
following
southern
breeze
the
norman
armada
left
the
french
shores
and
steered
for
england
the
invaders
crossed
an
undefended
sea
and
found
an
undefended
coast
it
was
in
pevensey
bay
in
sussex
at
bulverhithe
between
the
castle
of
pevensey
and
hastings
that
the
last
conquerors
of
this
island
landed
on
the
of
september
harold
was
at
york
rejoicing
over
his
recent
victory
which
had
delivered
england
from
her
ancient
scandinavian
foes
and
resettling
the
government
of
the
counties
which
harald
hardrada
had
overrun
when
the
tidings
reached
him
that
duke
william
of
normandy
and
his
host
had
landed
on
the
sussex
shore
harold
instantly
hurried
southward
to
meet
this
enemy
the
severe
loss
which
his
army
had
sustained
in
the
battle
with
the
norwegians
must
have
made
it
impossible
for
many
of
his
veteran
troops
to
accompany
him
in
his
forced
march
to
london
and
thence
to
sussex
he
halted
at
the
capital
only
six
days
and
during
that
time
gave
orders
for
collecting
forces
from
the
southern
and
midland
counties
and
also
directed
his
fleet
to
reassemble
off
the
sussex
coast
harold
was
well
received
in
london
and
his
summons
to
arms
was
promptly
obeyed
by
citizen
by
thane
by
socman
and
by
ceorl
for
he
had
shown
himself
during
his
brief
reign
a
just
and
wise
king
affable
to
all
men
active
for
the
good
of
his
country
and
in
the
words
of
the
old
historian
sparing
himself
from
no
fatigue
by
land
or
by
sea
he
might
have
gathered
a
much
more
numerous
army
than
that
of
william
but
his
recent
victory
had
made
him
overconfident
and
he
was
irritated
by
the
reports
of
the
country
being
ravaged
by
the
invaders
as
soon
therefore
as
he
had
collected
a
small
army
in
london
he
marched
off
toward
the
coast
pressing
forward
as
rapidly
as
his
men
could
traverse
surrey
and
sussex
in
the
hope
of
taking
the
normans
unawares
as
he
had
recently
by
a
similar
forced
march
succeeded
in
surprising
the
norwegians
but
he
had
now
to
deal
with
a
foe
equally
brave
with
harald
hardrada
and
far
more
skilful
and
wary
the
old
norman
chroniclers
describe
the
preparations
of
william
on
his
landing
with
a
graphic
vigor
which
would
be
wholly
lost
by
transfusing
their
racy
norman
couplets
and
terse
latin
prose
into
the
current
style
of
modern
history
it
is
best
to
follow
them
closely
though
at
the
expense
of
much
quaintness
and
occasional
uncouthness
of
expression
they
tell
us
how
duke
william
own
ship
was
the
first
of
the
norman
fleet
it
was
called
the
and
was
the
gift
of
his
duchess
matilda
on
the
head
of
the
ship
in
the
front
which
mariners
call
the
prow
there
was
a
brazen
child
bearing
an
arrow
with
a
bended
bow
his
face
was
turned
toward
england
and
thither
he
looked
as
though
he
was
about
to
shoot
the
breeze
became
soft
and
sweet
and
the
sea
was
smooth
for
their
landing
the
ships
ran
on
dry
land
and
each
ranged
by
the
other
side
there
you
might
see
the
good
sailors
the
sergeants
and
squires
sally
forth
and
unload
the
ships
cast
the
anchors
haul
the
ropes
bear
out
shields
and
saddles
and
land
the
and
the
palfreys
the
archers
came
forth
and
touched
land
the
first
each
with
his
bow
strung
and
with
his
quiver
full
of
arrows
slung
at
his
side
all
were
shaven
and
shorn
and
all
clad
in
short
garments
ready
to
attack
to
shoot
to
wheel
about
and
skirmish
all
stood
well
equipped
and
of
good
courage
for
the
fight
and
they
scoured
the
whole
shore
but
found
not
an
armed
man
there
after
the
archers
had
thus
gone
forth
the
knights
landed
all
armed
with
their
hauberks
on
their
shields
slung
at
their
necks
and
their
helmets
laced
they
formed
together
on
the
shore
each
armed
and
mounted
on
his
all
had
their
swords
girded
on
and
rode
forward
into
the
country
with
their
lances
raised
then
the
carpenters
landed
who
had
great
axes
in
their
hands
and
planes
and
adzes
hung
at
their
sides
they
took
counsel
together
and
sought
for
a
good
spot
to
place
a
castle
on
they
had
brought
with
them
in
the
fleet
three
wooden
castles
from
normandy
in
pieces
all
ready
for
framing
together
and
they
took
the
materials
of
one
of
these
out
of
the
ships
all
shaped
and
pierced
to
receive
the
pins
which
they
had
brought
cut
and
ready
in
large
barrels
and
before
evening
had
set
in
they
had
finished
a
good
fort
on
the
english
ground
and
there
they
placed
their
stores
all
then
ate
and
drank
enough
and
were
right
glad
that
they
were
ashore
when
duke
william
himself
landed
as
he
stepped
on
the
shore
he
slipped
and
fell
forward
upon
his
two
hands
forthwith
all
raised
a
loud
cry
of
distress
an
evil
sign
said
they
is
here
but
he
cried
out
lustily
see
my
lords
by
the
splendor
of
god
i
have
taken
possession
of
england
with
both
my
hands
it
is
now
mine
and
what
is
mine
is
yours
footnote
william
customary
oath
the
next
day
they
marched
along
the
to
hastings
near
that
place
the
duke
fortified
a
camp
and
set
up
the
two
other
wooden
castles
the
foragers
and
those
who
looked
out
for
booty
seized
all
the
clothing
and
provisions
they
could
find
lest
what
had
been
brought
by
the
ships
should
fail
them
and
the
english
were
to
be
seen
fleeing
before
them
driving
off
their
cattle
and
quitting
their
houses
many
took
shelter
in
and
even
there
they
were
in
grievous
alarm
besides
the
marauders
from
the
norman
camp
strong
bodies
of
cavalry
were
detached
by
william
into
the
country
and
these
when
harold
and
his
army
made
their
rapid
march
from
london
southward
fell
back
in
good
order
upon
the
main
body
of
the
normans
and
reported
that
the
saxon
king
was
rushing
on
like
a
madman
but
harold
when
he
found
that
his
hopes
of
surprising
his
adversary
were
vain
changed
his
tactics
and
halted
about
seven
miles
from
the
norman
lines
he
sent
some
spies
who
spoke
the
french
language
to
examine
the
number
and
preparations
of
the
enemy
who
on
their
return
related
with
astonishment
that
there
were
more
priests
in
william
camp
than
there
were
fighting
men
in
the
english
army
they
had
mistaken
for
priests
all
the
norman
soldiers
who
had
short
hair
and
shaven
chins
for
the
english
laymen
were
then
accustomed
to
wear
long
hair
and
mustaches
harold
who
knew
the
norman
usages
smiled
at
their
words
and
said
those
whom
you
have
seen
in
such
numbers
are
not
priests
but
stout
soldiers
as
they
will
soon
make
us
feel
harold
army
was
far
inferior
in
number
to
that
of
the
normans
and
some
of
his
captains
advised
him
to
retreat
upon
london
and
lay
waste
the
country
so
as
to
starve
down
the
strength
of
the
invaders
the
policy
thus
recommended
was
unquestionably
the
wisest
for
the
saxon
fleet
had
now
reassembled
and
intercepted
all
william
communications
with
normandy
and
as
soon
as
his
stores
of
provisions
were
exhausted
he
must
have
moved
forward
upon
london
where
harold
at
the
head
of
the
full
military
strength
of
the
kingdom
could
have
defied
his
assault
and
probably
might
have
witnessed
his
rival
destruction
by
famine
and
disease
without
having
to
strike
a
single
blow
but
harold
bold
blood
was
up
and
his
kindly
heart
could
not
endure
to
inflict
on
the
south
saxon
subjects
even
the
temporary
misery
of
wasting
the
country
he
would
not
burn
houses
and
villages
neither
would
he
take
away
the
substance
of
his
people
harold
brothers
gurth
and
leofwine
were
with
him
in
the
camp
and
gurth
endeavored
to
persuade
him
to
absent
himself
from
the
battle
the
incident
shows
how
well
devised
had
been
william
scheme
of
binding
harold
by
the
oath
on
the
holy
relics
my
brother
said
the
young
saxon
prince
thou
canst
not
deny
that
either
by
force
or
free
will
thou
hast
made
duke
william
an
oath
on
the
bodies
of
saints
why
then
risk
thyself
in
the
battle
with
a
perjury
upon
thee
to
us
who
have
sworn
nothing
this
is
a
holy
and
a
just
war
for
we
are
fighting
for
our
country
leave
us
then
alone
to
fight
this
battle
and
he
who
has
the
right
will
win
harold
replied
that
he
would
not
look
on
while
others
risked
their
lives
for
him
men
would
hold
him
a
coward
and
blame
him
for
sending
his
best
friends
where
he
dared
not
go
himself
he
resolved
therefore
to
fight
and
to
fight
in
person
but
he
was
still
too
good
a
general
to
be
the
assailant
in
the
action
and
he
posted
his
army
with
great
skill
along
a
ridge
of
rising
ground
which
opened
southward
and
was
covered
on
the
back
by
an
extensive
wood
he
strengthened
his
position
by
a
palisade
of
stakes
and
osier
hurdles
and
there
he
said
he
would
defend
himself
against
whoever
should
seek
him
the
ruins
of
battle
abbey
at
this
hour
attest
the
place
where
army
was
posted
and
the
high
altar
of
the
abbey
stood
on
the
very
spot
where
harold
own
standard
was
planted
during
the
fight
and
where
the
carnage
was
the
thickest
immediately
after
his
victory
william
vowed
to
build
an
abbey
on
the
site
and
a
fair
and
stately
pile
soon
rose
there
where
for
many
ages
the
monks
prayed
and
said
masses
for
the
souls
of
those
who
were
slain
in
the
battle
whence
the
abbey
took
its
name
before
that
time
the
place
was
called
senlac
little
of
the
ancient
edifice
now
remains
but
it
is
easy
to
trace
in
the
park
and
the
neighborhood
the
scenes
of
the
chief
incidents
in
the
action
and
it
is
impossible
to
deny
the
generalship
shown
by
harold
in
stationing
his
men
especially
when
we
bear
in
mind
that
he
was
deficient
in
cavalry
the
arm
in
which
his
adversary
main
strength
consisted
william
only
chance
of
safety
lay
in
bringing
on
a
general
engagement
and
he
joyfully
advanced
his
army
from
their
camp
on
the
hill
over
hastings
nearer
to
the
saxon
position
but
he
neglected
no
means
of
weakening
his
opponent
and
renewed
his
summonses
and
demands
on
harold
with
an
ostentatious
air
of
sanctity
and
moderation
a
monk
named
hugues
maigrot
came
in
william
name
to
call
upon
the
saxon
king
to
do
one
of
three
things
either
to
resign
his
royalty
in
favor
of
william
or
to
refer
it
to
the
arbitration
of
the
pope
to
decide
which
of
the
two
ought
to
be
king
or
let
it
be
determined
by
the
issue
of
a
single
combat
harold
abruptly
replied
will
not
resign
my
title
i
will
not
refer
it
to
the
pope
nor
will
i
accept
the
single
combat
he
was
far
from
being
deficient
in
bravery
but
he
was
no
more
at
liberty
to
stake
the
crown
which
he
had
received
from
a
whole
people
in
the
chance
of
a
duel
than
to
deposit
it
in
the
hands
of
an
italian
priest
william
not
at
all
ruffled
by
the
saxon
refusal
but
steadily
pursuing
the
course
of
his
calculated
measures
sent
the
norman
monk
again
after
giving
him
these
instructions
and
tell
harold
that
if
he
will
keep
his
former
compact
with
me
i
will
leave
to
him
all
the
country
which
is
beyond
the
humber
and
will
give
his
brother
gurth
all
the
lands
which
godwin
held
if
he
still
persist
in
refusing
my
offers
then
thou
shalt
tell
him
before
all
his
people
that
he
is
a
perjurer
and
a
liar
that
he
and
all
who
shall
support
him
are
excommunicated
by
the
mouth
of
the
pope
and
that
the
bull
to
that
effect
is
in
my
hands
hugues
maigrot
delivered
this
message
in
a
solemn
tone
and
the
norman
chronicle
says
that
at
the
word
the
english
chiefs
looked
at
one
another
as
if
some
great
danger
were
impending
one
of
them
then
spoke
as
follows
must
fight
whatever
may
be
the
danger
to
us
for
what
we
have
to
consider
is
not
whether
we
shall
accept
and
receive
a
new
lord
as
if
our
king
were
dead
the
case
is
quite
otherwise
the
norman
has
given
our
lands
to
his
captains
to
his
knights
to
all
his
people
the
greater
part
of
whom
have
already
done
homage
to
him
for
them
they
will
all
look
for
their
gift
if
their
duke
become
our
king
and
he
himself
is
bound
to
deliver
up
to
them
our
goods
our
wives
and
our
daughters
all
is
promised
to
them
beforehand
they
come
not
only
to
ruin
us
but
to
ruin
our
descendants
also
and
to
take
from
us
the
country
of
our
ancestors
and
what
shall
we
do
whither
shall
we
go
when
we
have
no
longer
a
country
the
english
promised
by
a
unanimous
oath
to
make
neither
peace
nor
truce
nor
treaty
with
the
invader
but
to
die
or
drive
away
the
normans
the
of
october
was
occupied
in
these
negotiations
and
at
night
the
duke
announced
to
his
men
that
the
next
day
would
be
the
day
of
battle
that
night
is
said
to
have
been
passed
by
the
two
armies
in
very
different
manners
the
saxon
soldiers
spent
it
in
joviality
singing
their
national
songs
and
draining
huge
horns
of
ale
and
wine
round
their
campfires
the
normans
when
they
had
looked
to
their
arms
and
horses
confessed
themselves
to
the
priests
with
whom
their
camp
was
thronged
and
received
the
sacrament
by
thousands
at
a
time
on
saturday
the
of
october
was
fought
the
great
battle
it
is
not
difficult
to
compose
a
narrative
of
its
principal
incidents
from
the
historical
information
which
we
possess
especially
if
aided
by
an
examination
of
the
ground
but
it
is
far
better
to
adopt
the
words
of
the
old
chroniclers
who
wrote
while
the
recollections
of
the
battle
were
yet
fresh
and
while
the
feelings
and
prejudices
of
the
combatants
yet
glowed
in
the
bosoms
of
living
men
robert
wace
the
norman
poet
who
presented
his
de
to
henry
ii
is
the
most
picturesque
and
animated
of
the
old
writers
and
from
him
we
can
obtain
a
more
vivid
and
full
description
of
the
conflict
than
even
the
most
brilliant
of
the
present
time
can
supply
we
have
also
an
antique
memorial
of
the
battle
more
to
be
relied
on
than
either
chronicler
or
poet
and
which
confirms
wace
narrative
remarkably
in
the
celebrated
bayeux
tapestry
which
represents
the
principal
scenes
of
duke
william
expedition
and
of
the
circumstances
connected
with
it
in
minute
though
occasionally
grotesque
details
and
which
was
undoubtedly
the
production
of
the
same
age
in
which
the
battle
took
place
whether
we
admit
or
reject
the
legend
that
queen
matilda
and
the
ladies
of
her
court
wrought
it
with
their
own
hands
in
honor
of
the
royal
conqueror
let
us
therefore
suffer
the
old
norman
chronicler
to
transport
our
imaginations
to
the
fair
sussex
scenery
northwest
of
hastings
as
it
appeared
on
that
october
morning
the
norman
host
is
pouring
forth
from
its
tents
and
each
troop
and
each
company
is
forming
fast
under
the
banner
of
its
leader
the
masses
have
been
sung
which
were
finished
betimes
in
the
morning
the
barons
have
all
assembled
round
duke
william
and
the
duke
has
ordered
that
the
army
shall
be
formed
in
three
divisions
so
as
to
make
the
attack
upon
the
saxon
position
in
three
places
the
duke
stood
on
a
hill
where
he
could
best
see
his
men
the
barons
surrounded
him
and
he
spake
to
them
proudly
he
told
them
how
he
trusted
them
and
how
all
that
he
gained
should
be
theirs
and
how
sure
he
felt
of
conquest
for
in
all
the
world
there
was
not
so
brave
an
army
or
such
good
men
and
true
as
were
then
forming
around
him
then
they
cheered
him
in
turn
and
cried
out
will
not
see
one
coward
none
here
will
fear
to
die
for
love
of
you
if
need
be
and
he
answered
them
thank
you
well
for
god
sake
spare
not
strike
hard
at
the
beginning
stay
not
to
take
spoil
all
the
booty
shall
be
in
common
and
there
will
be
plenty
for
everyone
there
will
be
no
safety
in
asking
quarter
or
in
flight
the
english
will
never
love
or
spare
a
norman
felons
they
were
and
felons
they
are
false
they
were
and
false
they
will
be
show
no
weakness
toward
them
for
they
will
have
no
pity
on
you
neither
the
coward
for
running
well
nor
the
bold
man
for
smiting
well
will
be
the
better
liked
by
the
english
nor
will
any
be
the
more
spared
on
either
account
you
may
fly
to
the
sea
but
you
can
fly
no
farther
you
will
find
neither
ships
nor
bridge
there
there
will
be
no
sailors
to
receive
you
and
the
english
will
overtake
you
there
and
slay
you
in
your
shame
more
of
you
will
die
in
flight
than
in
battle
then
as
flight
will
not
secure
you
fight
and
you
will
conquer
i
have
no
doubt
of
the
victory
we
are
come
for
glory
the
victory
is
in
our
hands
and
we
may
make
sure
of
obtaining
it
if
we
so
please
as
the
duke
was
speaking
thus
and
would
yet
have
spoken
more
william
fitzosbern
rode
up
with
his
horse
all
coated
with
iron
said
he
tarry
here
too
long
let
us
all
arm
ourselves
allons
then
all
went
to
their
tents
and
armed
themselves
as
they
best
might
and
the
duke
was
very
busy
giving
everyone
his
orders
and
he
was
courteous
to
all
the
vassals
giving
away
many
arms
and
horses
to
them
when
he
prepared
to
arm
himself
he
called
first
for
his
hauberk
and
a
man
brought
it
on
his
arm
and
placed
it
before
him
but
in
putting
his
head
in
to
get
it
on
he
unawares
turned
it
the
wrong
way
with
the
back
part
in
front
he
soon
changed
it
but
when
he
saw
that
those
who
stood
by
were
sorely
alarmed
he
said
have
seen
many
a
man
who
if
such
a
thing
had
happened
to
him
would
not
have
borne
arms
or
entered
the
field
the
same
day
but
i
never
believed
in
omens
and
i
never
will
i
trust
in
god
for
he
does
in
all
things
his
pleasure
and
ordains
what
is
to
come
to
pass
according
to
his
will
i
have
never
liked
nor
believed
in
diviners
but
i
commend
myself
to
our
lady
let
not
this
mischance
give
you
trouble
the
hauberk
which
was
turned
wrong
and
then
set
right
by
me
signifies
that
a
change
will
arise
out
of
the
matter
which
we
are
now
stirring
you
shall
see
the
name
of
duke
changed
into
king
yea
a
king
shall
i
be
who
hitherto
have
been
but
duke
then
he
crossed
himself
and
straightway
took
his
hauberk
stooped
his
head
and
put
it
on
aright
and
laced
his
helmet
and
girt
on
his
sword
which
a
varlet
brought
him
then
the
duke
called
for
his
good
horse
a
better
could
not
be
found
it
had
been
sent
him
by
a
king
of
spain
out
of
very
great
friendship
neither
arms
nor
the
press
of
fighting
men
did
it
fear
if
its
lord
spurred
it
on
walter
giffard
brought
it
the
duke
stretched
out
his
hand
took
the
reins
put
foot
in
stirrup
and
mounted
and
the
good
horse
pawed
pranced
reared
himself
up
and
curvetted
the
viscount
of
toarz
saw
how
the
duke
bore
himself
in
arms
and
said
to
his
people
that
were
around
him
have
i
seen
a
man
so
fairly
armed
nor
one
who
rode
so
gallantly
or
bore
his
arms
or
became
his
hauberk
so
well
neither
any
one
who
bore
his
lance
so
gracefully
or
sat
his
horse
and
managed
him
so
nobly
there
is
no
such
knight
under
heaven
a
fair
count
he
is
and
fair
king
he
will
be
let
him
fight
and
he
shall
overcome
shame
be
to
the
man
who
shall
fail
him
then
the
duke
called
for
the
standard
which
the
pope
had
sent
him
and
he
who
bore
it
having
unfolded
it
the
duke
took
it
and
called
to
raoul
de
conches
my
standard
said
he
i
would
not
but
do
you
right
by
right
and
by
ancestry
your
line
are
of
normandy
and
very
good
knights
have
they
all
been
but
raoul
said
that
he
would
serve
the
duke
that
day
in
other
guise
and
would
fight
the
english
with
his
hand
as
long
as
life
should
last
then
the
duke
bade
walter
giffard
bear
the
standard
but
he
was
old
and
and
bade
the
duke
give
the
standard
to
some
younger
and
stronger
man
to
carry
then
the
duke
said
fiercely
the
splendor
of
god
my
lords
i
think
you
mean
to
betray
and
fail
me
in
this
great
need
said
giffart
so
we
have
done
no
treason
nor
do
i
refuse
from
any
felony
toward
you
but
i
have
to
lead
a
great
chivalry
both
hired
men
and
the
men
of
my
fief
never
had
i
such
good
means
of
serving
you
as
i
now
have
and
if
god
please
i
will
serve
you
if
need
be
i
will
die
for
you
and
will
give
my
own
heart
for
yours
my
faith
quoth
the
duke
always
loved
thee
and
now
i
love
thee
more
if
i
survive
this
day
thou
shalt
be
the
better
for
it
all
thy
days
then
he
called
out
a
knight
whom
he
had
heard
much
praised
tosteins
le
blanc
by
name
whose
abode
was
at
to
him
he
delivered
the
standard
and
tosteins
took
it
right
cheerfully
and
bowed
low
to
him
in
thanks
and
bore
it
gallantly
and
with
good
heart
his
kindred
still
have
quittance
of
all
service
for
their
inheritance
on
this
account
and
their
heirs
are
entitled
so
to
hold
their
inheritance
forever
william

william
the
son

a

good

they

the
poitevins

the
bretons
and
all
the
barons
of
maine
and
i
with
my
own
great
men
my
friends
and
kindred
will
fight
in
the
middle
throng
where
the
battle
shall
be
the
hottest
the
barons
and
knights
and
were
all
now
armed
the
were
well
equipped
each
bearing
bow
and
sword
on
their
heads
were
caps
and
to
their
feet
were
bound
buskins
some
had
good
hides
which
they
had
bound
round
their
bodies
and
many
were
clad
in
frocks
and
had
quivers
and
bows
hung
to
their
girdles
the
knights
had
hauberks
and
swords
boots
of
steel
and
shining
helmets
shields
at
their
necks
and
in
their
hands
lances
and
all
had
their
cognizances
so
that
each
might
know
his
fellow
and
norman
might
not
strike
norman
nor
frenchman
kill
his
countryman
by
mistake
those
on
foot
led
the
way
with
serried
ranks
bearing
their
bows
the
knights
rode
next
supporting
the
archers
from
behind
thus
both
horse
and
foot
kept
their
course
and
order
of
march
as
they
began
in
close
ranks
at
a
gentle
pace
that
the
one
might
not
pass
or
separate
from
the
other
all
went
firmly
and
compactly
bearing
themselves
gallantly
harold
had
summoned
his
men
earls
barons
and
vavasors
from
the
castles
and
the
cities
from
the
ports
the
villages
and
boroughs
the
peasants
were
also
called
together
from
the
villages
bearing
such
arms
as
they
found
clubs
and
great
picks
iron
forks
and
stakes
the
english
had
enclosed
the
place
where
harold
was
with
his
friends
and
the
barons
of
the
country
whom
he
had
summoned
and
called
together
those
of
london
had
come
at
once
and
those
of
kent
of
hertfort
and
of
essesse
those
of
surée
and
susesse
of
edmund
and
sufoc
of
norwis
and
norfoc
of
cantorbierre
and
stanfort
bedefort
and
hundetone
the
men
of
northanton
also
came
and
those
of
eurowic
and
bokinkeham
of
bed
and
notinkeham
lindesie
and
nichole
there
came
also
from
the
west
all
who
heard
the
summons
and
very
many
were
to
be
seen
coming
from
salebiere
and
dorset
from
bat
and
from
sumerset
many
came
too
from
about
glocestre
and
many
from
wirecestre
from
wincestre
hontesire
and
brichesire
and
many
more
from
other
counties
that
we
have
not
named
and
can
not
indeed
recount
all
who
could
bear
arms
and
had
learned
the
news
of
the
duke
arrival
came
to
defend
the
land
but
none
came
from
beyond
humbre
for
they
had
other
business
upon
their
hands
the
danes
and
tosti
having
much
damaged
and
weakened
them
harold
knew
that
the
normans
would
come
and
attack
him
hand
to
hand
so
he
had
early
enclosed
the
field
in
which
he
had
placed
his
men
he
made
them
arm
early
and
range
themselves
for
the
battle
he
himself
having
put
on
arms
and
equipments
that
became
such
a
lord
the
duke
he
said
ought
to
seek
him
as
he
wanted
to
conquer
england
and
it
became
him
to
abide
the
attack
who
had
to
defend
the
land
he
commanded
the
people
and
counselled
his
barons
to
keep
themselves
all
together
and
defend
themselves
in
a
body
for
if
they
once
separated
they
would
with
difficulty
recover
themselves
normans
said
he
good
vassals
valiant
on
foot
and
on
horseback
good
knights
are
they
on
horseback
and
well
used
to
battle
all
is
lost
if
they
once
penetrate
our
ranks
they
have
brought
long
lances
and
swords
but
you
have
pointed
lances
and
bills
and
i
do
not
expect
that
their
arms
can
stand
against
yours
cleave
whenever
you
can
it
will
be
ill
done
if
you
spare
aught
the
english
had
built
up
a
fence
before
them
with
their
shields
and
with
ash
and
other
wood
and
had
well
joined
and
wattled
in
the
whole
work
so
as
not
to
leave
even
a
crevice
and
thus
they
had
a
barricade
in
their
front
through
which
any
norman
who
would
attack
them
must
first
pass
being
covered
in
this
way
by
their
shields
and
barricades
their
aim
was
to
defend
themselves
and
if
they
had
remained
steady
for
that
purpose
they
would
not
have
been
conquered
that
day
for
every
norman
who
made
his
way
in
lost
his
life
in
dishonor
either
by
hatchet
or
bill
by
club
or
other
weapon
they
wore
short
and
close
hauberks
and
helmets
that
hung
over
their
garments
king
harold
issued
orders
and
made
proclamation
round
that
all
should
be
ranged
with
their
faces
toward
the
enemy
and
that
no
one
should
move
from
where
he
was
so
that
whoever
came
might
find
them
ready
and
that
whatever
anyone
be
he
norman
or
other
should
do
each
should
do
his
best
to
defend
his
own
place
then
he
ordered
the
men
of
kent
to
go
where
the
normans
were
likely
to
make
the
attack
for
they
say
that
the
men
of
kent
are
entitled
to
strike
first
and
that
whenever
the
king
goes
to
battle
the
first
blow
belongs
to
them
the
right
of
the
men
of
london
is
to
guard
the
king
body
to
place
themselves
around
him
and
to
guard
his
standard
and
they
were
accordingly
placed
by
the
standard
to
watch
and
defend
it
when
harold
had
made
all
ready
and
given
his
orders
he
came
into
the
midst
of
the
english
and
dismounted
by
the
side
of
the
standard
leofwine
and
gurth
his
brothers
were
with
him
and
around
him
he
had
barons
enough
as
he
stood
by
his
standard
which
was
in
truth
a
noble
one
sparkling
with
gold
and
precious
stones
after
the
victory
william
sent
it
to
the
pope
to
prove
and
commemorate
his
great
conquest
and
glory
the
english
stood
in
close
ranks
ready
and
eager
for
the
fight
and
they
moreover
made
a
fosse
which
went
across
the
field
guarding
one
side
of
their
army
meanwhile
the
normans
appeared
advancing
over
the
ridge
of
a
rising
ground
and
the
first
division
of
their
troops
moved
onward
along
the
hill
and
across
a
valley
and
presently
another
division
still
larger
came
in
sight
close
following
upon
the
first
and
they
were
led
toward
another
part
of
the
field
forming
together
as
the
first
body
had
done
and
while
harold
saw
and
examined
them
and
was
pointing
them
out
to
gurth
a
fresh
company
came
in
sight
covering
all
the
plain
and
in
the
midst
of
them
was
raised
the
standard
that
came
from
rome
near
it
was
the
duke
and
the
best
men
and
greatest
strength
of
the
army
were
there
the
good
knights
the
good
vassals
and
brave
warriors
were
there
and
there
were
gathered
together
the
gentle
barons
the
good
archers
and
the
whose
duty
it
was
to
guard
the
duke
and
range
themselves
around
him
the
youths
and
common
herd
of
the
camp
whose
business
was
not
to
join
in
the
battle
but
to
take
care
of
the
harness
and
stores
moved
off
toward
a
rising
ground
the
priests
and
the
clerks
also
ascended
a
hill
there
to
offer
up
prayers
to
god
and
watch
the
event
of
the
battle
the
english
stood
firm
on
foot
in
close
ranks
and
carried
themselves
right
boldly
each
man
had
his
hauberk
on
with
his
sword
girt
and
his
shield
at
his
neck
great
hatchets
were
also
slung
at
their
necks
with
which
they
expected
to
strike
heavy
blows
the
normans
brought
on
the
three
divisions
of
their
army
to
attack
at
different
places
they
set
out
in
three
companies
and
in
three
companies
did
they
fight
the
first
and
second
had
come
up
and
then
advanced
the
third
which
was
the
greatest
with
that
came
the
duke
with
his
own
men
and
all
moved
boldly
forward
as
soon
as
the
two
armies
were
in
full
view
of
each
other
great
noise
and
tumult
arose
you
might
hear
the
sound
of
many
trumpets
of
bugles
and
of
horns
and
then
you
might
see
men
ranging
themselves
in
line
lifting
their
shields
raising
their
lances
bending
their
bows
handling
their
arrows
ready
for
assault
and
defence
the
english
stood
steady
to
their
post
the
normans
still
moved
on
and
when
they
drew
near
the
english
were
to
be
seen
stirring
to
and
fro
were
going
and
coming
troops
ranging
themselves
in
order
some
with
their
color
rising
others
turning
pale
some
making
ready
their
arms
others
raising
their
shields
the
brave
man
rousing
himself
to
fight
the
coward
trembling
at
the
approach
of
danger
then
taillefer
who
sang
right
well
rode
mounted
on
a
swift
horse
before
the
duke
singing
of
charlemagne
and
of
roland
of
oliver
and
the
peers
who
died
in
roncesvalles
and
when
they
drew
nigh
to
the
english
boon
sire
cried
taillefer
have
long
served
you
and
you
owe
me
for
all
such
service
so
please
you
you
shall
repay
it
i
ask
as
my
guerdon
and
beseech
you
for
it
earnestly
that
you
will
allow
me
to
strike
the
first
blow
in
the
battle
and
the
duke
answered
grant
it
then
taillefer
put
his
horse
to
a
gallop
charging
before
all
the
rest
and
struck
an
englishman
dead
driving
his
lance
below
the
breast
into
his
body
and
stretching
him
upon
the
ground
then
he
drew
his
sword
and
struck
another
crying
out
on
come
on
what
do
ye
sirs
lay
on
lay
on
at
the
second
blow
he
struck
the
english
pushed
forward
and
surrounded
and
slew
him
forthwith
arose
the
noise
and
cry
of
war
and
on
either
side
the
people
put
themselves
in
motion
the
normans
moved
on
to
the
assault
and
the
english
defended
themselves
well
some
were
striking
others
urging
onward
all
were
bold
and
cast
aside
fear
and
now
behold
that
battle
was
gathered
whereof
the
fame
is
yet
mighty
loud
and
far
resounded
the
bray
of
the
horns
and
the
shocks
of
the
lances
the
mighty
strokes
of
maces
and
the
quick
clashing
of
swords
one
while
the
englishmen
rushed
on
another
while
they
fell
back
one
while
the
men
from
over
sea
charged
onward
and
again
at
other
times
retreated
the
normans
shouted
the
english
people
then
came
the
cunning
manoeuvres
the
rude
shocks
and
strokes
of
the
lance
and
blows
of
the
swords
among
the
sergeants
and
soldiers
both
english
and
norman
when
the
english
fall
the
normans
shout
each
side
taunts
and
defies
the
other
yet
neither
knoweth
what
the
other
saith
and
the
normans
say
the
english
bark
because
they
understand
not
their
speech
some
wax
strong
others
weak
the
brave
exult
but
the
cowards
tremble
as
men
who
are
sore
dismayed
the
normans
press
on
the
assault
and
the
english
defend
their
post
well
they
pierce
the
hauberks
and
cleave
the
shields
receive
and
return
mighty
blows
again
some
press
forward
others
yield
and
thus
in
various
ways
the
struggle
proceeds
in
the
plain
was
a
fosse
which
the
normans
had
now
behind
them
having
passed
it
in
the
fight
without
regarding
it
but
the
english
charged
and
drove
the
normans
before
them
till
they
made
them
fall
back
upon
this
fosse
overthrowing
into
it
horses
and
men
many
were
to
be
seen
falling
therein
rolling
one
over
the
others
with
their
faces
to
the
earth
and
unable
to
rise
many
of
the
english
also
whom
the
normans
drew
down
along
with
them
died
there
at
no
time
during
the
day
battle
did
so
many
normans
die
as
perished
in
that
fosse
so
those
said
who
saw
the
dead
the
varlets
who
were
set
to
guard
the
harness
began
to
abandon
it
as
they
saw
the
loss
of
the
frenchmen
when
thrown
back
upon
the
fosse
without
power
to
recover
themselves
being
greatly
alarmed
at
seeing
the
difficulty
in
restoring
order
they
began
to
quit
the
harness
and
sought
around
not
knowing
where
to
find
shelter
then
duke
brother
odo
the
good
priest
the
bishop
of
bayeux
galloped
up
and
said
to
them
fast
stand
fast
be
quiet
and
move
not
fear
nothing
for
if
god
please
we
shall
conquer
yet
so
they
took
courage
and
rested
where
they
were
and
odo
returned
galloping
back
to
where
the
battle
was
most
fierce
and
was
of
great
service
on
that
day
he
had
put
a
hauberk
on
over
a
white
aube
wide
in
the
body
with
the
sleeve
tight
and
sat
on
a
white
horse
so
that
all
might
recognize
him
in
his
hand
he
held
a
mace
and
wherever
he
saw
most
need
he
held
up
and
stationed
the
knights
and
often
urged
them
on
to
assault
and
strike
the
enemy
from
nine
in
the
morning
when
the
combat
began
till
three
came
the
battle
was
up
and
down
this
way
and
that
and
no
one
knew
who
would
conquer
and
win
the
land
both
sides
stood
so
firm
and
fought
so
well
that
no
one
could
guess
which
would
prevail
the
norman
archers
with
their
bows
shot
thickly
upon
the
english
but
they
covered
themselves
with
their
shields
so
that
the
arrows
could
not
reach
their
bodies
nor
do
any
mischief
how
true
so
ever
was
their
aim
or
however
well
they
shot
then
the
normans
determined
to
shoot
their
arrows
upward
into
the
air
so
that
they
might
fall
on
their
enemies
heads
and
strike
their
faces
the
archers
adopted
this
scheme
and
shot
up
into
the
air
toward
the
english
and
the
arrows
in
falling
struck
their
heads
and
faces
and
put
out
the
eyes
of
many
and
all
feared
to
open
their
eyes
or
leave
their
faces
unguarded
the
arrows
now
flew
thicker
than
rain
before
the
wind
fast
sped
the
shafts
that
the
english
call
then
it
was
that
an
arrow
that
had
been
thus
shot
upward
struck
harold
above
his
right
eye
and
put
it
out
in
his
agony
he
drew
the
arrow
and
threw
it
away
breaking
it
with
his
hands
and
the
pain
to
his
head
was
so
great
that
he
leaned
upon
his
shield
so
the
english
were
wont
to
say
and
still
say
to
the
french
that
the
arrow
was
well
shot
which
was
so
sent
up
against
their
king
and
that
the
archer
won
them
great
glory
who
thus
put
out
harold
eye
the
normans
saw
that
the
english
defended
themselves
well
and
were
so
strong
in
their
position
that
they
could
do
little
against
them
so
they
consulted
together
privily
and
arranged
to
draw
off
and
pretend
to
flee
till
the
english
should
pursue
and
scatter
themselves
over
the
field
for
they
saw
that
if
they
could
once
get
their
enemies
to
break
their
ranks
they
might
be
attacked
and
discomfited
much
more
easily
as
they
had
said
so
they
did
the
normans
by
little
and
little
fled
the
english
following
them
as
the
one
fell
back
the
other
pressed
after
and
when
the
frenchmen
retreated
the
english
thought
and
cried
out
that
the
men
of
france
fled
and
would
never
return
thus
they
were
deceived
by
the
pretended
flight
and
great
mischief
thereby
befell
them
for
if
they
had
not
moved
from
their
position
it
is
not
likely
that
they
would
have
been
conquered
at
all
but
like
fools
they
broke
their
lines
and
pursued
the
normans
were
to
be
seen
following
up
their
stratagem
retreating
slowly
so
as
to
draw
the
english
farther
on
as
they
still
flee
the
english
pursue
they
push
out
their
lances
and
stretch
forth
their
hatchets
following
the
normans
as
they
go
rejoicing
in
the
success
of
their
scheme
and
scattering
themselves
over
the
plain
and
the
english
meantime
jeered
and
insulted
their
foes
with
words
they
cried
came
hither
in
an
evil
hour
wanting
our
lands
and
seeking
to
seize
our
property
fools
that
ye
were
to
come
normandy
is
too
far
off
and
you
will
not
easily
reach
it
it
is
of
little
use
to
run
back
unless
you
can
cross
the
sea
at
a
leap
or
can
drink
it
dry
your
sons
and
daughters
are
lost
to
you
the
normans
bore
it
all
but
in
fact
they
knew
not
what
the
english
said
their
language
seemed
like
the
baying
of
dogs
which
they
could
not
understand
at
length
they
stopped
and
turned
round
determined
to
recover
their
ranks
and
the
barons
might
be
heard
crying
for
a
halt
then
the
normans
resumed
their
former
position
turning
their
faces
toward
the
enemy
and
their
men
were
to
be
seen
facing
round
and
rushing
onward
to
a
fresh
the
one
party
assaulting
the
other
this
man
striking
another
pressing
onward
one
hits
another
misses
one
flies
another
pursues
one
is
aiming
a
stroke
while
another
discharges
his
blow
norman
strives
with
englishman
again
and
aims
his
blows
afresh
one
flies
another
pursues
swiftly
the
combatants
are
many
the
plain
wide
the
battle
and
the
fierce
on
every
hand
they
fight
hard
the
blows
are
heavy
and
the
struggle
becomes
fierce
the
normans
were
playing
their
part
well
when
an
english
knight
came
rushing
up
having
in
his
company
a
hundred
men
furnished
with
various
arms
he
wielded
a
northern
hatchet
with
the
blade
a
full
foot
long
and
was
well
armed
after
his
manner
being
tall
bold
and
of
noble
carriage
in
the
front
of
the
battle
where
the
normans
thronged
most
he
came
bounding
on
swifter
than
the
stag
many
normans
falling
before
him
and
his
company
he
rushed
straight
upon
a
norman
who
was
armed
and
riding
on
a
and
tried
with
his
hatchet
of
steel
to
cleave
his
helmet
but
the
blow
miscarried
and
the
sharp
blade
glanced
down
before
the
driving
through
the
horse
neck
down
to
the
ground
so
that
both
horse
and
master
fell
together
to
the
earth
i
know
not
whether
the
englishman
struck
another
blow
but
the
normans
who
saw
the
stroke
were
astonished
and
about
to
abandon
the
assault
when
roger
de
montgomeri
came
galloping
up
with
his
lance
set
and
heeding
not
the
axe
which
the
englishman
wielded
aloft
struck
him
down
and
left
him
stretched
on
the
ground
then
roger
cried
out
strike
the
day
is
ours
and
again
a
fierce
was
to
be
seen
with
many
a
blow
of
lance
and
sword
the
english
still
defending
themselves
killing
the
horses
and
cleaving
the
shields
there
was
a
french
soldier
of
noble
mien
who
sat
his
horse
gallantly
he
spied
two
englishmen
who
were
also
carrying
themselves
boldly
they
were
both
men
of
great
worth
and
had
become
companions
in
arms
and
fought
together
the
one
protecting
the
other
they
bore
two
long
and
broad
bills
and
did
great
mischief
to
the
normans
killing
both
horses
and
men
the
french
soldier
looked
at
them
and
their
bills
and
was
sore
alarmed
for
he
was
afraid
of
losing
his
good
horse
the
best
that
he
had
and
would
willingly
have
turned
to
some
other
quarter
if
it
would
not
have
looked
like
cowardice
he
soon
however
recovered
his
courage
and
spurring
his
horse
gave
him
the
bridle
and
galloped
swiftly
forward
fearing
the
two
bills
he
raised
his
shield
and
struck
one
of
the
englishmen
with
his
lance
on
the
breast
so
that
the
iron
passed
out
at
his
back
at
the
moment
that
he
fell
the
lance
broke
and
the
frenchman
seized
the
mace
that
hung
at
his
right
side
and
struck
the
other
englishman
a
blow
that
completely
fractured
his
skull
on
the
other
side
was
an
englishman
who
much
annoyed
the
french
continually
assaulting
them
with
a
hatchet
he
had
a
helmet
made
of
wood
which
he
had
fastened
down
to
his
coat
and
laced
round
his
neck
so
that
no
blows
could
reach
his
head
the
ravage
he
was
making
was
seen
by
a
gallant
norman
knight
who
rode
a
horse
that
neither
fire
nor
water
could
stop
in
its
career
when
its
master
urged
it
on
the
knight
spurred
and
his
horse
carried
him
on
well
till
he
charged
the
englishman
striking
him
over
the
helmet
so
that
it
fell
down
over
his
eyes
and
as
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
raise
it
and
uncover
his
face
the
norman
cut
off
his
right
hand
so
that
his
hatchet
fell
to
the
ground
another
norman
sprang
forward
and
eagerly
seized
the
prize
with
both
his
hands
but
he
kept
it
little
space
and
paid
dearly
for
it
for
as
he
stooped
to
pick
up
the
hatchet
an
englishman
with
his
axe
struck
him
over
the
back
breaking
all
his
bones
so
that
his
entrails
and
lungs
gushed
forth
the
knight
of
the
good
horse
meantime
returned
without
injury
but
on
his
way
he
met
another
englishman
and
bore
him
down
under
his
horse
wounding
him
grievously
and
trampling
him
altogether
under
foot
and
now
might
be
heard
the
loud
clang
and
cry
of
battle
and
the
clashing
of
lances
the
english
stood
firm
in
their
barricades
and
shivered
the
lances
beating
them
into
pieces
with
their
bills
and
maces
the
normans
drew
their
swords
and
hewed
down
the
barricades
and
the
english
in
great
trouble
fell
back
upon
their
standard
where
were
collected
the
maimed
and
wounded
there
were
many
knights
of
chauz
who
jousted
and
made
attacks
the
english
knew
not
how
to
joust
or
bear
arms
on
horseback
but
fought
with
hatchets
and
bills
a
man
when
he
wanted
to
strike
with
one
of
their
hatchets
was
obliged
to
hold
it
with
both
his
hands
and
could
not
at
the
same
time
as
it
seems
to
me
both
cover
himself
and
strike
with
any
freedom
the
english
fell
back
toward
the
standard
which
was
upon
a
rising
ground
and
the
normans
followed
them
across
the
valley
attacking
them
on
foot
and
horseback
then
hue
de
mortemer
with
the
sires
and
cler
rode
up
and
charged
overthrowing
many
robert
fitz
erneis
fixed
his
lance
took
his
shield
and
galloping
toward
the
standard
with
his
sword
struck
an
englishman
who
was
in
front
killed
him
and
then
drawing
back
his
sword
attacked
many
others
and
pushed
straight
for
the
standard
trying
to
beat
it
down
but
the
english
surrounded
it
and
killed
him
with
their
bills
he
was
found
on
the
spot
when
they
afterward
sought
for
him
dead
and
lying
at
the
standard
foot
duke
william
pressed
close
upon
the
english
with
his
lance
striving
hard
to
reach
the
standard
with
the
great
troop
he
led
and
seeking
earnestly
for
harold
on
whose
account
the
whole
war
was
the
normans
follow
their
lord
and
press
around
him
they
ply
their
blows
upon
the
english
and
these
defend
themselves
stoutly
striving
hard
with
their
enemies
returning
blow
for
blow
one
of
them
was
a
man
of
great
strength
a
wrestler
who
did
great
mischief
to
the
normans
with
his
hatchet
all
feared
him
for
he
struck
down
a
great
many
normans
the
duke
spurred
on
his
horse
and
aimed
a
blow
at
him
but
he
stooped
and
so
escaped
the
stroke
then
jumping
on
one
side
he
lifted
his
hatchet
aloft
and
as
the
duke
bent
to
avoid
the
blow
the
englishman
boldly
struck
him
on
the
head
and
beat
in
his
helmet
though
without
doing
much
injury
he
was
very
near
falling
however
but
bearing
on
his
stirrups
he
recovered
himself
immediately
and
when
he
thought
to
have
revenged
himself
upon
the
churl
by
killing
him
he
had
escaped
dreading
the
duke
blow
he
ran
back
in
among
the
english
but
he
was
not
safe
even
there
for
the
normans
seeing
him
pursued
and
caught
him
and
having
pierced
him
through
and
through
with
their
lances
left
him
dead
on
the
ground
where
the
throng
of
the
battle
was
greatest
the
men
of
kent
and
essex
fought
wondrously
well
and
made
the
normans
again
retreat
but
without
doing
them
much
injury
and
when
the
duke
saw
his
men
fall
back
and
the
english
triumphing
over
them
his
spirit
rose
high
and
he
seized
his
shield
and
his
lance
which
a
vassal
handed
to
him
and
took
his
post
by
his
standard
then
those
who
kept
close
guard
by
him
and
rode
where
he
rode
being
about
a
thousand
armed
men
came
and
rushed
with
closed
ranks
upon
the
english
and
with
the
weight
of
their
good
horses
and
the
blows
the
knights
gave
broke
the
press
of
the
enemy
and
scattered
the
crowd
before
them
the
good
duke
leading
them
on
in
front
many
pursued
and
many
fled
many
were
the
englishmen
who
fell
around
and
were
trampled
under
the
horses
crawling
upon
the
earth
and
not
able
to
rise
many
of
the
richest
and
noblest
men
fell
in
the
rout
but
still
the
english
rallied
in
places
smote
down
those
whom
they
reached
and
maintained
the
combat
the
best
they
could
beating
down
the
men
and
killing
the
horses
one
englishman
watched
the
duke
and
plotted
to
kill
him
he
would
have
struck
him
with
his
lance
but
he
could
not
for
the
duke
struck
him
first
and
felled
him
to
the
earth
loud
was
now
the
clamor
and
great
the
slaughter
many
a
soul
then
quitted
the
body
it
inhabited
the
living
marched
over
the
heaps
of
dead
and
each
side
was
weary
of
striking
he
charged
on
who
could
and
he
who
could
no
longer
strike
still
pushed
forward
the
strong
struggled
with
the
strong
some
failed
others
triumphed
the
cowards
fell
back
the
brave
pressed
on
and
sad
was
his
fate
who
fell
in
the
midst
for
he
had
little
chance
of
rising
again
and
many
in
truth
fell
who
never
rose
at
all
being
crushed
under
the
throng
and
now
the
normans
had
pressed
on
so
far
that
at
last
they
had
reached
the
standard
there
harold
had
remained
defending
himself
to
the
utmost
but
he
was
sorely
wounded
in
his
eye
by
the
arrow
and
suffered
grievous
pain
from
the
blow
an
armed
man
came
in
the
throng
of
the
battle
and
struck
him
on
the
ventail
of
his
helmet
and
beat
him
to
the
ground
and
as
he
sought
to
recover
himself
a
knight
beat
him
down
again
striking
him
on
the
thick
of
his
thigh
down
to
the
bone
gurth
saw
the
english
falling
around
and
that
there
was
no
remedy
he
saw
his
race
hastening
to
ruin
and
despaired
of
any
aid
he
would
have
fled
but
could
not
for
the
throng
continually
increased
and
the
duke
pushed
on
till
he
reached
him
and
struck
him
with
great
force
whether
he
died
of
that
blow
i
know
not
but
it
was
said
that
he
fell
under
it
and
rose
no
more
the
standard
was
beaten
down
the
golden
standard
was
taken
and
harold
and
the
rest
of
his
friends
were
slain
but
there
was
so
much
eagerness
and
throng
of
so
many
around
seeking
to
kill
him
that
i
know
not
who
it
was
that
slew
him
the
english
were
in
great
trouble
at
having
lost
their
king
and
at
the
duke
having
conquered
and
beat
down
the
standard
but
they
still
fought
on
and
defended
themselves
long
and
in
fact
till
the
day
drew
to
a
close
then
it
clearly
appeared
to
all
that
the
standard
was
lost
and
the
news
had
spread
throughout
the
army
that
harold
for
certain
was
dead
and
all
saw
that
there
was
no
longer
any
hope
so
they
left
the
field
and
those
fled
who
could
william
fought
well
many
an
assault
did
he
lead
many
a
blow
did
he
give
and
many
receive
and
many
fell
dead
under
his
hand
two
horses
were
killed
under
him
and
he
took
a
third
when
necessary
so
that
he
fell
not
to
the
ground
and
lost
not
a
drop
of
blood
but
whatever
anyone
did
and
whoever
lived
or
died
this
is
certain
that
william
conquered
and
that
many
of
the
english
fled
from
the
field
and
many
died
on
the
spot
then
he
returned
thanks
to
god
and
in
his
pride
ordered
his
standard
to
be
brought
and
set
up
on
high
where
the
english
standard
had
stood
and
that
was
the
signal
of
his
having
conquered
and
beaten
down
the
standard
and
he
ordered
his
tent
to
be
raised
on
the
spot
among
the
dead
and
had
his
meat
brought
thither
and
his
supper
prepared
there
then
he
took
off
his
armor
and
the
barons
and
knights
pages
and
squires
came
when
he
had
unstrung
his
shield
and
they
took
the
helmet
from
his
head
and
the
hauberk
from
his
back
and
saw
the
heavy
blows
upon
his
shield
and
how
his
helmet
was
dinted
in
and
all
greatly
wondered
and
said
a
baron
never
bestrode
nor
dealt
such
blows
nor
did
such
feats
of
arms
neither
has
there
been
on
earth
such
a
knight
since
rollant
and
oliver
thus
they
lauded
and
extolled
him
greatly
and
rejoiced
in
what
they
saw
but
grieving
also
for
their
friends
who
were
slain
in
the
battle
and
the
duke
stood
meanwhile
among
them
of
noble
stature
and
mien
and
rendered
thanks
to
the
king
of
glory
through
whom
he
had
the
victory
and
thanked
the
knights
around
him
mourning
also
frequently
for
the
dead
and
he
ate
and
drank
among
the
dead
and
made
his
bed
that
night
upon
the
field
the
morrow
was
sunday
and
those
who
had
slept
upon
the
field
of
battle
keeping
watch
around
and
suffering
great
fatigue
bestirred
themselves
at
break
of
day
and
sought
out
and
buried
such
of
the
bodies
of
their
dead
friends
as
they
might
find
the
noble
ladies
of
the
land
also
came
some
to
seek
their
husbands
and
others
their
fathers
sons
or
brothers
they
bore
the
bodies
to
their
villages
and
interred
them
at
the
churches
and
the
clerks
and
priests
of
the
country
were
ready
and
at
the
request
of
their
friends
took
the
bodies
that
were
found
and
prepared
graves
and
lay
them
therein
king
harold
was
carried
and
buried
at
varham
but
i
know
not
who
it
was
that
bore
him
thither
neither
do
i
know
who
buried
him
many
remained
on
the
field
and
many
had
fled
in
the
night
such
is
a
norman
account
of
the
battle
of
hastings
which
does
full
justice
to
the
valor
of
the
saxons
as
well
as
to
the
skill
and
bravery
of
the
victors
it
is
indeed
evident
that
the
loss
of
the
battle
by
the
english
was
owing
to
the
wound
which
harold
received
in
the
afternoon
and
which
must
have
incapacitated
him
from
effective
command
when
we
remember
that
he
had
himself
just
won
the
battle
of
stamford
bridge
over
harald
hardrada
by
the
manoeuvre
of
a
feigned
flight
it
is
impossible
to
suppose
that
he
could
be
deceived
by
the
same
stratagem
on
the
part
of
the
normans
at
hastings
but
his
men
when
deprived
of
his
control
would
very
naturally
be
led
by
their
inconsiderate
ardor
into
the
pursuit
that
proved
so
fatal
to
them
all
the
narratives
of
the
battle
however
much
they
vary
as
to
the
precise
time
and
manner
of
fall
eulogize
the
generalship
and
the
personal
prowess
which
he
displayed
until
the
fatal
arrow
struck
him
the
skill
with
which
he
had
posted
his
army
was
proved
both
by
the
slaughter
which
it
cost
the
normans
to
force
the
position
and
also
by
the
desperate
rally
which
some
of
the
saxons
made
after
the
battle
in
the
forest
in
the
rear
in
which
they
cut
off
a
large
number
of
the
pursuing
normans
this
circumstance
is
particularly
mentioned
by
william
of
poictiers
the
conqueror
own
chaplain
indeed
if
harold
or
either
of
his
brothers
had
survived
the
remains
of
the
english
army
might
have
formed
again
in
the
wood
and
could
at
least
have
effected
an
orderly
retreat
and
prolonged
the
war
but
both
gurth
and
leofwine
and
all
the
bravest
thanes
of
southern
england
lay
dead
on
senlac
around
their
fallen
king
and
the
fallen
standard
of
their
country
the
exact
number
that
perished
on
the
saxons
side
is
unknown
but
we
read
that
on
the
side
of
the
victors
out
of
sixty
thousand
men
who
had
been
engaged
no
less
than
a
fourth
perished
so
well
had
the
english
billmen
plyed
the
ghastly
blow
and
so
sternly
had
the
saxon
cloven
norman
casque
and
mail
the
old
historian
daniel
justly
as
well
as
forcibly
remarks
thus
was
tried
by
the
great
assize
of
god
judgment
in
battle
the
right
of
power
between
the
english
and
norman
nations
a
battle
the
most
memorable
of
all
others
and
however
miserably
lost
yet
most
nobly
fought
on
the
part
of
england
many
a
pathetic
legend
was
told
in
after
years
respecting
the
discovery
and
the
burial
of
the
corpse
of
our
last
saxon
king
the
main
circumstances
though
they
seem
to
vary
are
perhaps
reconcilable
two
of
the
monks
of
waltham
abbey
which
harold
had
founded
a
little
time
before
his
election
to
the
throne
had
accompanied
him
to
the
battle
on
the
morning
after
the
slaughter
they
begged
and
gained
permission
of
the
conqueror
to
search
for
the
body
of
their
benefactor
the
norman
soldiery
and
camp
followers
had
stripped
and
gashed
the
slain
and
the
two
monks
vainly
strove
to
recognize
from
among
the
mutilated
and
gory
heaps
around
them
the
features
of
their
former
king
they
sent
for
harold
mistress
edith
surnamed
the
fair
and
the
to
aid
them
the
eye
of
love
proved
keener
than
the
eye
of
gratitude
and
the
saxon
lady
even
in
that
aceldama
knew
her
harold
the
king
mother
now
sought
the
victorious
norman
and
begged
the
dead
body
of
her
son
but
william
at
first
answered
in
his
wrath
and
the
hardness
of
his
heart
that
a
man
who
had
been
false
to
his
word
and
his
religion
should
have
no
other
sepulchre
than
the
sand
of
the
shore
he
added
with
a
sneer
harold
mounted
guard
on
the
coast
while
he
was
alive
he
may
continue
his
guard
now
he
is
dead
the
taunt
was
an
unintentional
eulogy
and
a
grave
washed
by
the
spray
of
the
sussex
waves
would
have
been
the
noblest
for
the
martyr
of
saxon
freedom
but
harold
mother
was
urgent
in
her
lamentations
and
her
prayers
the
conqueror
relented
like
achilles
he
gave
up
the
dead
body
of
his
fallen
foe
to
a
parent
supplications
and
the
remains
of
king
harold
were
deposited
with
regal
honors
in
waltham
abbey
on
christmas
day

the
same
year

his
german
descent
was
born
the

of
a
carpenter
in

he
became
a
monk
of
the
benedictine
order
and
was
educated
at
the
abbey
of

in
france
in
he
went
to
rome
called
by
a
papal
election
and
there
saw
abuses
which
from
that
moment
he
fixed
his
mind
upon
striving
to
abolish
in
he
was
again
in
rome
and
soon
rose
to
the
rank
of
cardinal
for
many
years
hildebrand
was
the
real
director
of
papal
policy
and
long
before
his
election
as
pope
in
he
worked
to
accomplish
the
reforms
that
distinguish
his
pontificate
which
continued
till
his
death
in
as
a
part
of
the
holy
roman

italy
held
a
dual
relation
to
the
emperor
and
the
pope
between
the
roman
pontiffs
and
the
secular
heads
of
the
empire
the
struggle
for
supremacy
had
been
long
and
often
bitter
at
the
time
of
hildebrand
active
appearance
the
papacy
was
in
a
state
of
degradation
which
demoralized
the
church
itself
long
before
his
elevation
to
the
papal
chair
hildebrand
efforts
had
met
with
much
success
and
the
power
of
the
holy
see
was
gradually
increased
independently
of
the
emperor
whose
will
had
hitherto
governed
the
papal
elections
in
chiefly
through
the
influence
of
hildebrand
pope
nicholas
ii
was
chosen
by
a
new
method
and
from
that
time
the
choice
of
popes
has
been
made
by
the
sacred
college
of
cardinals
hildebrand
reluctantly
accepted
the
office
of
pope
but
having
entered
upon
the
task
which
he
knew
to
be
so
formidable
he
pursued
it
with
such
energy
courage
and
success
as
to
make
his
pontificate
one
of
the
most
memorable
in
the
annals
of
the
church
of
his
greatest
contests
within
the
ecclesiastical
jurisdiction
over
the
celibacy
of
the
clergy
and
simony
as
well
as
of
those
with
the
imperial
power
represented
by
henry

the
following
account
will
be
found
to
present
the
essential
features
with
a
clearness
and
comprehensiveness
which
are
seldom
seen
in
the
relation
of
matter
so
complex
and
in
a
narrative
so
concise
the
differing
viewpoints
are
also
instructive
as
presented
by

the
time
had
come
when
hildebrand
was
to
receive
the
reward
of
the
important
services
which
he
had
rendered
to
the
holy
see
he
had
been
the
ruling
spirit
under
five
popes

and
alexander
four
of
whom
were
indebted
to
him
for
their
election
but
now
he
must
himself
be
raised
to
the
papal
throne
the
clergy
were
assembled
in
the
lateran
church
to
celebrate
the
obsequies
of
alexander
hildebrand
as
archdeacon
was
performing
the
service
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
requiem
for
the
departed
a
shout
was
heard
which
seemed
to
come
as
if
by
inspiration
from
the
assembled
multitude
hildebrand
is
pope
peter
chooses
the
archdeacon
hildebrand
from
the
funeral
procession
hildebrand
flew
to
the
pulpit
and
with
impassioned
gestures
seemed
to
be
imploring
silence
the
storm
however
did
not
cease
till
one
of
the
cardinals
in
the
name
of
the
sacred
college
declared
that
they
had
unanimously
elected
him

the
people
had
chosen

in
scarlet
robes
crowned
with

gregory
vii
ascended
the
chair
of
peter
the
pope
very
soon
made
known
the
course
which
he
should
pursue
he
issued
a
prohibition
against
the
marriage
of
the
clergy
and
in
a
council
at
rome
abolished
the
right
of
investiture
he
was
determined
to
redress
the
wrongs
of
society
he
had
seen
oppression
laying
waste
the
fairest
provinces
of
europe
he
had
seen
many
princes
goaded
on
by
the
revengeful
passions
of
their
nature
flinging
wide
their
standard
to
the
winds
and
dipping
their
hands
in
the
blood
of
those
who
if
christianity
be
not
a
fable
were
their
very
brothers
a
magnificent
vision
rose
up
before
him
he
would
rule
the
world
by
religion
he
would
be
the
caesar
of
the
spiritual
monarchy
he
and
a
council
of
prelates
annually
assembled
at
rome
would
constitute
a
tribunal
from
whose
judgment
there
should
be
no
appeal
empowered
to
hold
the
supreme
mediation
in
matters
relating
to
the
interests
of
the
body
politic
to
settle
contested
successions
to
kingdoms
and
to
compel
men
to
cease
from
their
dissensions
footnote
that
is
the
right
of
the
civil
power
to
grant
church
offices
at
will
and
to
invest
ecclesiastics
with
symbols
of
their
offices
and
receive
their
oaths
of
fealty
the
civil
power
was
to
pledge
itself
to
be
prompt
in
the
execution
of
their
decrees
against
those
who
despised
their
authority
but
if
the
decisions
of
those
judges
were
to
carry
weight
they
must
be
men
of
unblemished
integrity
the
purity
of
their
ermine
must
be
altogether
unsullied
the
sale
of
the
highest
spiritual
offices
by
the
prince
who
had
deprived
the
clergy
and
people
of
their
right
to
elect
them
which
had
stained
the
hands
of
the
church
and
undermined
its

had
rendered
the

the
creatures
of
their
will
must
be
forbidden
the
clergy
must
possess
an
absolute
exemption
from
the
criminal
justice
of
the
state
they
must
recognize
but
one
ruler
the
pope
who
disposed
of
them
indirectly
through
the
bishops
or
directly
in
cases
of
exemption
and
used
them
as
tools
for
the
execution
of
his
behests
in
fact
they
were
to
constitute
a
vast
army
exclusively
devoted
to
the
service
of
an
ecclesiastical
monarch
they
must
be
unconnected
by
marriage
with
the
world
around
them
that
they
might
be
bound
more
closely
to
one
another
and
to
their
head
that
they
might
be
saved
from
the
temptation
of
restless
projects
for
the
advancement
of
their
families
which
have
caused
so
much
scandal
in
the
world
and
that
they
might
give
an
exalted
idea
of
their
sanctity
inasmuch
as
in
order
that
they
might
give
themselves
to
prayer
and
the
ministry
of
the
word
they
would
forego
that
connubial
bliss
the
portion
of
those
the
happiest
of
their
kind
whom
gentler
stars
unite
and
in
one
fate
their
hearts
their
fortunes
and
their
beings
blend
the
marriage
of
the
clergy
was
everywhere
more
or
less
repugnant
to
the
general
feeling
of
christendom
the
rise
and
progress
of
asceticism
in
the
church
had
their
source
in
human
nature
and
its
growth
was
quickened
by
a
reaction
from
the
immorality
of
paganism
the
general
effect
on
the
position
of
the
clergy
was
to
compel
them
to
keep
progress
with
the
prevailing
movement
men
consecrated
to
the
service
of
jehovah
must
rise
superior
to
the
common
herd
of
their
by
a
decree
of
pope
siricius
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
century
marriage
was
interdicted
to
all
priests
and
deacons
this
decree
was
however
very
imperfectly
observed
during
the
following
centuries
the
general
feeling
was
however
at
this
time
very
strongly
against
the
married
clergy
but
throughout
the
spiritual
realm
of
hildebrand
in
italy
from
calabria
to
the
alps
the
clergy
had
risen
up
in
rebellion
against
him
and
the
popes
his
predecessors
when
they
attempted
to
coerce
them
into
celibacy
we
believe
that
this
opposition
much
more
than
the
strife
as
to
investitures
was
the
cause
of
the
strong
feeling
almost
unprecedented
which
existed
against
gregory
vii
we
must
now
show
that
gregory
enforced
his
views
as
to
investitures
this
part
of
our
subject
is
important
because
it
gave
occasion
for
the
assertion
that
the
pope
could
depose
the
holy
roman
emperor
and
the
king
of
italy
if
he
should
find
him
morally
or
physically
disqualified
for
fulfilling
the
condition
on
which
his
appointment
depended
that
he
should
defend
him
from
his
enemies
henry
iv
at
the
beginning
of
his
reign
only
ten
years
of
age
was
at
this
time
emperor
footnote
that
is
emperor
of
the
holy
roman
empire
which
included
the
people
of
europe
and
also
in
theory
at
least
italy
one
day
as
he
was
standing
by
the
rhine
a
galley
with
silken
streamers
appeared
into
which
he
was
invited
to
enter
after
he
had
been
gliding
for
some
time
down
the
stream
he
found
that
he
was
a
prisoner
the
archbishops
of
milan
and
cologne
with
other
powerful
lords
having
consigned
him
to
a
degrading
captivity
administered
in
his
name
the
government
of
the
empire
by
affording
him
every
means
of
vicious
indulgence
they
were
only
too
successful
in
corrupting
a
noble
and
generous
nature
very
soon
he
was
guilty
of
crimes
and
plunged
into
excesses
which
seemed
to
cry
aloud
for
vengeance
the
pope
saw
that
the
time
had
come
for
the
execution
of
his
designs
henry
had
been
guilty
of
the
grossest
simony
the
spiritual
dignities
had
been
openly
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
he
saw
also
that
while
the
clergy
took
the
oath
of
fealty
to
the
monarch
and
were
invested
by
him
with
the
ring
and
crozier
he
could
not
establish
the
superiority
of
the
spiritual
to
the
temporal
jurisdiction
he
therefore
summoned
a
council
at
the
lateran
which
issued
a
decree
against
lay
investitures
the
pope
having
thus
declared
war
against
the
emperor
proceeded
to
fill
up
certain
vacant
bishoprics
and
to
suspend
bishops
both
in
germany
and
italy
who
had
been
guilty
of
simony
he
also
cited
henry
before
him
to
answer
for
his
simony
crimes
and
excesses
this
citation
is
alleged
to
have
given
occasion
for
an
attempted
crime
supposed
to
have
been
sanctioned
by
henry
which
may
show
us
that
while
the
pope
was
asserting
a
right
to
rule
over
the
nations
he
could
not
rule
in
his
own
city
on
christmas
eve
the
city
of
rome
was
visited
with
a
violent
tempest
darkness
brooded
over
the
land
the
inhabitants
thought
that
the
day
of
judgment
was
at
hand
in
the
midst
of
this
war
of
the
elements
two
processions
were
seen
advancing
toward
the
church
of
santa
maria
maggiore
at
the
head
of
one
of
them
was
hildebrand
leading
his
priests
to
worship
at
a
shrine
at
the
head
of
the
other
was
cencius
a
roman
noble
in
one
of
the
pauses
in
the
roar
of
the
tempest
when
the
pope
was
heard
blessing
his
flock
the
arm
of
cencius
grasped
his
person
and
the
sword
of
a
ruffian
inflicted
a
wound
on
his
forehead
bound
with
cords
the
pope
was
removed
to
a
mansion
in
the
city
from
which
he
was
the
next
day
to
be
removed
to
exile
or
to
death
a
sword
was
aimed
at
the
pontiff
bosom
when
the
cries
of
a
fierce
multitude
threatening
to
burn
down
the
house
arrested
the
arm
of
the
assassin
an
arrow
discharged
from
below
reached
and
slew
the
latter
cencius
fell
at
the
pope
feet
a
suppliant
for
pardon
and
for
life
the
pontiff
immediately
pardoned
him
then
amid
the
acclamations
of
the
roman
people
gregory
proceeded
to
complete
the
interrupted
solemnities
at
santa
maria
maggiore
the
war
between
henry
and
the
pope
continued
henry
summoned
a
synod
at
worms
in

assembly
consisting
of
the
mightiest
in
the
land
whom
the
pope
had
summoned
to
sit
in
judgment
on
henry
with
flashing
eyes
and
in
a
voice
of
thunder
he
directed
the
pope
to
descend
from
the
chair
of
peter
cries
of
indignation
rang
through
the
hall
and
a
hundred
swords
were
seen
leaping
from
their
scabbards
to
inflict
vengeance
on
the
daring
intruder
the
pope
with
difficulty
stilled
the
angry
tumult
then
rising
with
calm
dignity
amid
the
breathless
silence
of
the
assembled
multitude
he
uttered
that
dread
anathema
which
shuts
paradise
and
opens
hell
and
absolved
the
subjects
of
henry
from
their
allegiance
the
inhabitants
of
europe
were
struck
dumb
with
amazement
when
they
witnessed
this
exercise
of
papal
prerogative
they
thought
that
the
powerful
arm
of
henry
would
have
been
raised
to
smite
down
the
audacious
hildebrand
the
pope
however
well
knew
that
henry
had
by
his
excesses
alienated
from
himself
the
affections
of
his
subjects
the
sentence
gave
a
pretext
to
many
of
his
nobility
to
withdraw
from
their
allegiance
awed
by
spiritual
terrors
his
attendants
fell
away
from
him
as
if
he
had
been
smitten
by
a
leprosy
an
assembly
was
now
summoned
at
trebur
in
obedience
to
a
requisition
from
the
pope
at
which
it
was
decreed
that
if
the
emperor
continued
excommunicate
on
the
of
february
his
crown
should
be
given
to
another
the
theory
of
the
holy
roman
empire
had
thus
become
a
practical
reality
the
vassal
of
otho
had
reduced
the
successor
of
otho
to
vassalage
a
great
pope
had
wrung
from
the
superstition
and
reverence
of
mankind
a
spiritual
empire
which
it
was
hoped
would
extend
its
sway
to
earth
remotest
boundaries
artaud

gregory
made
it
an
invariable
rule
to
act
at
the
outset
with
gentleness
no
one
says
he
reaches
the
highest
rank
at
a
single
spring
great
edifices
rise
gradually
certain
of
his
strength
he
chose
to
employ
conciliation
he
especially
sought
to
convince
henry
but
the
excesses
in
which
that
prince
wallowed
were
so
abominable
that
his
subjects
in
all
parts
and
especially
the
great
revolted
against
him
in
gregory
assembled
a
council
which
pronounced
the
excommunication
of
the
king
with
all
the
terrible
consequences
attendant
upon
it
history
shows
several
emperors
of
the
east
excommunicated
by
preceding
popes
arcadius
by
innocent
i
anastasius
by
saint
symmachus
and
leo
the
isaurian
by
gregory
ii
and
gregory
iii
the
decree
of
the
same
council
set
forth
that
the
throne
vacated
by
henry
was
adjudged
to
rudolph
duke
of
swabia
already
created
king
of
germany
by
the
electors
of
the
empire
before
the
election
of
rudolph
gregory
had
declared
that
he
would
repair
to
germany
king
henry
on
his
part
promised
to
come
into
italy
the
pope
left
rome
with
an
escort
furnished
by
the
countess
of
tuscany
daughter
of
boniface
marquis
of
tuscany
the
march
of
gregory
was
a
triumph
amidst
that
escort
he
reached
vercelli
it
was
feared
by
some
that
henry
would
make
his
appearance
at
the
head
of
an
army
but
he
had
not
that
intention
the
pope
nevertheless
deemed
it
best
to
retire
into
the
fortress
of
canossa
belonging
to
the
countess
matilda
in
order
that
he
might
be
secure
from
all
violence
henry
had
spent
nearly
two
months
at
spires
in
a
profound
and
melancholy
solitude
the
weight
of
the
excommunication
oppressed
him
with
a
thousand
griefs
weary
of
that
state
of
uncertainty
and
still
as
ever
tricky
and
hypocritical
he
conceived
the
idea
of
winning
over
the
pope
by
an
apparent
piety
and
of
satisfying
his
requirements
by
a
brief
humiliation
moreover
the
decree
of
excommunication
declared
that
it
should
be
withdrawn
if
the
king
appeared
before
the
pope
within
a
year
from
the
date
of
the
decree
the
winter
was
severe
after
running
a
thousand
dangers
the
king
and
his
queen
arrived
at
turin
and
proceeded
to
placentia
thence
the
prince
announced
that
he
would
proceed
to
canossa
by
way
of
reggio
the
countess
matilda
met
him
with
hugo
bishop
of
cluny
she
wished
to
restore
harmony
between
the
pope
and
the
king
gregory
seemed
to
desire
that
henry
should
return
to
augsburg
to
be
judged
by
the
diet
the
envoys
of
the
king
at
canossa
replied
henry
does
not
fear
being
judged
he
knows
that
the
pope
will
protect
innocence
and
justice
but
the
anniversary
of
the
excommunication
is
at
hand
and
if
the
excommunication
be
not
removed
the
king
to
the
laws
of
the
will
lose
his
right
to
the
crown
the
prince
humbly
requests
the
holy
father
to
raise
the
interdict
and
to
restore
him
to
the
communion
of
the
church
he
is
ready
to
give
every
satisfaction
that
the
pope
shall
require
to
present
himself
at
such
place
and
at
such
time
as
the
pope
shall
order
to
meet
his
accusers
and
to
commit
himself
entirely
to
the
decision
of
the
head
of
the
church
henry
says
voigt
having
received
permission
to
advance
was
not
long
on
the
way
the
fortress
had
triple
inclosures
henry
was
conducted
into
the
second
his
retinue
remained
outside
the
first
he
had
laid
aside
the
insignia
of
royalty
nothing
announced
his
rank
all
day
long
henry
bareheaded
clad
in
penitential
garb
and
fasting
from
morning
till
night
awaited
the
sentence
of
the
sovereign
pontiff
he
thus
waited
during
a
second
and
a
third
day
during
the
intervening
time
he
had
not
ceased
to
negotiate
on
the
morrow
matilda
interceded
with
the
pope
on
behalf
of
henry
and
the
conditions
of
the
treaty
were
settled
the
prince
promised
to
give
satisfaction
to
the
complaints
made
against
him
by
his
subjects
and
he
took
an
oath
in
which
his
sureties
joined
when
those
oaths
were
taken
the
pontiff
gave
the
king
the
benediction
and
the
apostolic
peace
and
celebrated
mass
after
the
consecration
of
the
host
the
pope
called
henry
and
all
present
and
still
holding
the
host
in
his
hand
said
to
the
king
we
have
received
letters
from
you
and
those
of
your
party
in
which
we
are
accused
of
having
usurped
the
holy
see
by
simony
and
of
having
both
before
and
since
our
episcopacy
committed
crimes
which
according
to
the
canons
excluded
us
from
holy
orders
although
we
could
justify
ourselves
by
the
testimony
of
those
who
have
known
our
manner
of
life
from
our
childhood
and
who
were
the
authors
of
our
promotion
to
the
episcopacy
nevertheless
to
do
away
with
all
kind
of
scandal
we
will
appeal
to
the
judgment
not
of
men
but
of
god
let
the
body
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
that
we
are
about
to
take
be
this
day
a
proof
of
our
innocence
we
pray
the
almighty
to
dispel
all
suspicion
if
we
are
innocent
and
to
cause
us
suddenly
to
die
if
we
are
guilty
then
turning
towards
the
king
gregory
again
spoke
dear
son
do
also
as
you
have
seen
us
do
the
german
princes
have
daily
accused
you
to
us
of
a
great
number
of
crimes
for
which
those
nobles
maintain
that
you
ought
to
be
interdicted
during
your
whole
life
not
only
from
royalty
and
all
public
function
but
also
from
all
ecclesiastical
communion
and
from
all
commerce
of
civil
life
they
urgently
demand
that
you
be
judged
and
you
know
how
uncertain
are
all
human
judgments
do
then
as
we
advise
and
if
you
feel
that
you
are
innocent
deliver
the
church
from
this
scandal
and
yourself
from
this
embarrassment
take
this
other
portion
of
the
host
that
this
proof
of
your
innocence
may
close
the
lips
of
your
enemies
and
engage
us
to
be
your
most
ardent
defender
to
reconcile
you
with
the
nobles
and
forever
to
terminate
the
civil
war
this
address
astonished
the
king
going
apart
with
his
confidants
he
tremblingly
consulted
as
to
what
he
could
do
to
avoid
so
terrible
a
test
at
length
having
somewhat
recovered
his
calmness
he
said
to
the
pope
that
as
those
nobles
who
remained
faithful
were
for
the
most
part
absent
as
well
as
those
who
accused
him
the
latter
would
give
little
faith
to
what
he
might
do
in
his
own
justification
unless
it
were
done
in
their
presence
for
that
reason
he
asked
that
the
test
should
be
postponed
to
the
day
of
the
sitting
of
the
general
diet
and
the
pope
consented
when
the
pope
had
finished
mass
he
invited
the
king
to
dinner
treated
him
with
much
attention
and
dismissed
him
in
peace
to
his
own
people
who
had
remained
outside
the
castle
henry
on
his
return
to
his
nobles
was
not
well
received
henry
as
voigt
shows
soon
became
alarmed
at
their
disapprobation
which
originated
only
in
a
feeling
of
wounded
complicity
and
ambitious
views
which
could
not
hope
for
success
after
the
victory
gained
by
gregory
henry
hearing
himself
accused
of
weakness
thought
to
deliver
himself
from
so
much
annoyance
by
a
bold
perjury
and
he
endeavored
to
draw
gregory
and
matilda
into
a
snare
warned
by
faithful
friends
they
did
not
visit
the
king
as
had
been
agreed
and
that
new
wrong
determined
gregory
to
suspend
his
departure
for
the
diet
of
augsburg
no
one
not
even
the
pious
matilda
now
dared
to
speak
of
a
reconciliation
henry
held
at
brescia
in
a
pseudo
council
of
the
bishops
devoted
to
him
and
there
he
caused
guibert
archbishop
of
ravenna
an
avowed
enemy
of
gregory
to
be
elected
as
pope
and
he
deposed
gregory
although
he
was
recognized
as
the
legitimate
pope
by
the
whole
catholic
world
with
the
exception
of
the
bishops
in
revolt
under
the
direction
of
henry
on
learning
this
gregory
celebrated
at
rome
in
the

regular
council
in
which
he
again
excommunicated

was
defeated
with
great
loss
at
fladenheim
the
skill
and
courage
of
the
saxon
commander
however
turned
a
defeat
into
a
victory
emboldened
by
this
victory
gregory
excommunicated
henry
and
gave

and
conceded
that
rudolph

now
became

a
hasty
retreat
saved
the
forces
of
henry
from
the
impending
danger
the
pope
returned
in
triumph
to
the
lateran
but
within
a
few
hours
he
heard
from
the
streets
the
clash
of
arms
and
the
loud
shouts
of
the
combatants
a
fierce
contest
was
raging
between
the
soldiers
of
robert
and
the
citizens
who
espoused
the
cause
of
henry
a
conflagration
was
kindled
which
at
length
destroyed

when
he
thought
of

wars
he
had
kindled
sought
in
the
castle
of
salerno
from
the
normans
the
security
which
he
could
no
longer
expect
among
his
own
subjects
he
soon
found
that
the
hand
of
death
was
upon
him
he
summoned
round
his
bed
the
bishops
and
cardinals
who
had
accompanied
him
in
his
flight
from

he
maintained
the
truth
of
the
principles
for
which
he
had
always
contended
he
forgave
and
blessed
his
enemies
with
the
exception
of
the
antipope
and
the
emperor
he
had
received
the
transubstantiated
elements
the
final
unction
had
been
given

then
prepared
himself
to
die
anxious
to
catch
the
last
words
from

tongue
to
the
utterances
of
which
they
had
always
listened
with

were
bending

charles
knight
when
william
the
conqueror
had
been
some
years
established
in
his
english
realm
he
found
himself
confronted
with
a
feudal
baronage
largely
composed
of
men
who
had
gone
with
him
from
normandy
where
many
of
them
had
reluctantly
bowed
to
his
command
they
were
jealous
of
the
royal
power
and
eager
for
military
and
judicial
independence
within
their
own
manors
the
conqueror
met
this
situation
with
the
skill
of
political
genius
he
granted
large
estates
to
the
nobles
but
so
widely
scattered
as
to
render

of
the
great
and
hereditary
attachment
of
great
areas
of
population
to
separate
feudal
lords
impossible

caused
to

their
lords

bound
the

they

let
us
first
see
from
the
information
of
by
what
men
the
land
was
occupied
first
we
have
barons
and
we
have
thanes
the
barons
were
the
norman
nobles
the
thanes
the
saxon
these
were
included
under
the
general
designation
of
free
men
which
term
included
all
the
freeholders
of
a
manor
many
of
these
were
tenants
of
the
king
that
is
they
held
their
possessions

often
of

they
could
acquire
no

and
they
were
subject
to
many
exactions
and
oppressions
there
are
entries
in
which
show
that
the
villani
were
not
altogether
bondmen
but
represented
the
saxon
churl
the
lowest
class
were
slaves
the
class
corresponding
with
the
saxon
by
a
degradation
in
the
condition
of
the
villani
and
the
elevation
of
that
of
the

the
two
classes
were
brought
gradually
nearer
together
till
at
last
the
military
oppression
of
the
normans
thrusting
down
all
degrees
of
tenants
and
servants
into
one
common
slavery
or
at

into
strict
dependence
one
name
was
adopted
for
both
of
them
as
a
generic
term
that
of
of
the
subdivisions
of
these
great
classes
the
of
affords
us
some
particulars
we
find
that
some
of
the
nobles
are
described
as
soldiers
and
sometimes
the
milites
are
classed
with
the
inferior
orders
of
tenantry
many
of
the
chief
tenants
are
distinguished
by
their
offices
we
have
among
these
the
great
regal
officers
such
as
they
existed
in
the
saxon
times
the
and
from
whom
we
have
our

the

registered
as
to
its
extent
and
value
and
so
the
meadow
and
pasture
an
equal
exactness
is
bestowed
upon
the
woods
it
was
not
that
the
timber
was
of
great
commercial
value
in
a
country
which
possessed
such
insufficient
means
of
transport
but
that
the
acorns
and
upon
which
great
herds
of
swine
subsisted
were
of
essential
importance
to
keep
up
the
supply
of
food
we
constantly
find
such
entries
as
a
wood
for
pannage
of
fifty
hogs
there
are
woods
described
which
will
feed
a
hundred
two
hundred
three
hundred
hogs
and
on
the
bishop
of
london
demesne
at
fulham
a
thousand
hogs
could
fatten
the
value
of
a
tree
was
determined
by
the
number
of
hogs
that
could
lie
under
it
in
the
saxon
time
and
in
this
survey
of
the
norman
period
we
find
entries
of
useless
woods
and
woods
without
pannage
which
to
some
extent
were
considered
identical
in
some
of
the
woods
there
were
patches
of
cultivated
ground
as
the
entries
show
where
the
tenant
had
cleared
the
dense
undergrowth
and
had
his
corn
land
and
his
meadows
even
the
fen
lands
were
of
value
for
their
rents
were
paid
in
eels
there
is
only
mention
of
five
forests
in
this
record
windsor
gravelings
wiltshire
winburn
whichwood
and
the
new
forest
undoubtedly
there
were
many
more
but
being
no
objects
of
assessment
they
are
passed
over
it
would
be
difficult
not
to
associate
the
memory
of
the
conqueror
with
the
new
forest
and
not
to
believe
that
his
unbridled
will
was
here
the
cause
of
great
misery
and
devastation
ordericus
vitalis
says
speaking
of
the
death
of
william
second
son
richard
learn
now
my
reader
why
the
forest
in
which
the
young
prince
was
slain
received
the
name
of
the
new
forest
that
part
of
the
country
was
extremely
populous
from
early
times
and
full
of
hamlets
and
farms
a
numerous
population
cultivated
hampshire
with
unceasing
industry
so
that
the
southern
part
of
the
district
plentifully
supplied
winchester
with
the
products
of
the
land
when
william
i
ascended
the
throne
of
albion
being
a
great
lover
of
forests
he
laid
waste
more
than
sixty
parishes
compelling
the
inhabitants
to
emigrate
to
other
places
and
substituted
beasts
of
the
chase
for
human
beings
that
he
might
satisfy
his
ardor
for
hunting
there
is
probably
some
exaggeration
in
the
statement
of
the
country
being
extremely
populous
from
early
times
this
was
an
old
woody
district
called
ytene
no
forest
was
artificially
planted
as
voltaire
has
imagined
but
the
chases
were
opened
through
the
ancient
thickets
and
hamlets
and
solitary
cottages
were
demolished
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
some
woodland
spots
in
the
new
forest
have
still
names
with
the
terminations
of
and
there
are
many
evidences
of
the
former
existence
of
human
abodes
in
places
now
solitary
yet
we
doubt
whether
this
part
of
the
district
plentifully
supplied
winchester
with
food
as
ordericus
relates
for
it
is
a
sterile
district
in
most
places
fitted
for
little
else
than
the
growth
of
timber
the
lower
lands
are
marsh
and
the
upper
are
sand
the
conqueror
says
the
so
much
loved
the
high
deer
as
if
he
had
been
their
father
the
first
of
the
norman
kings
and
his
immediate
successors
would
not
be
very
scrupulous
about
the
depopulation
of
a
district
if
the
presence
of
men
interfered
with
their
pleasures
but
thierry
thinks
that
the
extreme
severity
of
the
forest
laws
was
chiefly
enforced
to
prevent
the
assemblage
of
saxons
in
those
vast
wooded
spaces
which
were
now
included
in
the
royal
demesnes
all
these
extensive
tracts
were
more
or
less
retreats
for
the
dispossessed
and
the
discontented
the
normans
under
pretence
of
preserving
the
stag
and
the
hare
could
tyrannize
with
a
pretended
legality
over
the
dwellers
in
these
secluded
places
and
thus
william
might
have
driven
the
saxon
people
of
ytene
to
emigrate
and
have
destroyed
their
cottages
as
much
from
a
possible
fear
of
their
association
as
from
his
own
love
of
the
high
deer
whatever
was
the
motive
there
were
devastation
and
misery
shows
that
in
the
district
of
the
new
forest
certain
manors
were
afforested
after
the
conquest
cultivated
portions
in
which
the
sabbath
bell
was
heard
william
of
jumièges
the
conqueror
own
chaplain
says
speaking
of
the
deaths
of
richard
and
rufus
there
were
many
who
held
that
the
two
sons
of
william
the
king
perished
by
the
judgment
of
god
in
these
woods
since
for
the
of
the
forest
he
had
destroyed
many
inhabited
villas
and
churches
within
its
it
appears
that
in
the
time
of
edward
the
confessor
about
seventeen
thousand
acres
of
this
district
had
been
afforested
but
that
the
cultivated
parts
remaining
had
then
an
estimated
value
of
three
hundred
and
pounds
after
the
afforestation
by
the
conqueror
the
cultivated
parts
yielded
only
one
hundred
and
pounds
the
grants
of
land
to
huntsmen
are
common
in
hampshire
as
in
other
parts
of
england
and
it
appears
to
have
been
the
duty
of
an
especial
officer
to
stall
the
deer
that
is
to
drive
them
with
his
troop
of
followers
from
all
parts
to
the
centre
of
a
circle
gradually
contracting
where
they
were
to
stand
for
the
onslaught
of
the
hunters
in
the
survey
many
parks
are
enumerated
the
word
hay
which
is
still
found
in
some
of
our
counties
meant
an
enclosed
part
of
a
wood
to
which
the
deer
were
driven
in
the
seventeenth
century
this
mode
of
hunting
upon
a
large
scale
by
stalling
the
deer
this
mimic
war
was
common
in
scotland
taylor
called
the
water
poet
was
present
at
such
a
gathering
and
has
described
the
scene
with
a
minuteness
which
may
help
us
to
form
a
picture
of
the
norman
hunters
five
or
six
hundred
men
do
rise
early
in
the
morning
and
they
do
disperse
themselves
divers
ways
and
seven
eight
or
ten
miles
compass
they
do
bring
or
chase
in
the
deer
in
many
herds
two
three
or
four
hundred
in
a
herd
to
such
a
place
as
the
noblemen
shall
appoint
them
then
when
the
day
is
come
the
lords
and
gentlemen
of
their
companies
do
ride
or
go
to
the
said
places
sometimes
wading
up
to
the
middle
through
bourns
and
rivers
and
then
they
being
come
to
the
place
do
lie
down
on
the
ground
till
those
foresaid
scouts
which
are
called
the
do
bring
down
the
deer
then
after
we
had
stayed
there
three
hours
or
thereabouts
we
might
perceive
the
deer
appear
on
the
hills
round
about
us
their
heads
making
a
show
like
a
wood
which
being
followed
close
by
the
tinkhelt
are
chased
down
into
the
valley
where
we
lay
then
all
the
valley
on
each
side
being
waylaid
with
a
hundred
couple
of
strong
irish
greyhounds
they
are
let
loose
as
occasion
serves
upon
the
herd
of
deer
that
with
dogs
guns
arrows
dirks
and
daggers
in
the
space
of
two
hours
fourscore
fat
deer
were
slain
affords
indubitable
proof
of
the
culture
of
the
vine
in
england
there
are
entries
of
vineyards
in
the
southern
and
eastern
counties
many
gardens
are
enumerated
mills
are
registered
with
great
distinctness
for
they
were
invariably
the
property
of
the
lords
of
the
manors
lay
or
ecclesiastical
and
the
tenants
could
only
grind
at
the
lord
mill
wherever
we
find
a
mill
specified
in
there
we
generally
find
a
mill
now
at
arundel
for
example
we
see
what
rent
was
paid
by
a
mill
and
there
still
stands
at
arundel
an
old
mill
whose
foundations
might
have
been
laid
before
the
conquest
salt
works
are
repeatedly
mentioned
they
were
either
works
upon
the
coast
for
procuring
marine
salt
by
evaporation
or
were
established
in
the
localities
of
inland
salt
springs
the
salt
works
of
cheshire
were
the
most
numerous
and
were
called
wiches
hence
the
names
of
some
places
such
as
middlewich
and
nantwich
the
revenue
from
mines
offers
some
curious
facts
no
mention
of
tin
is
to
be
found
in
cornwall
the
ravages
of
saxon
and
dane
and
the
constant
state
of
hostility
between
races
had
destroyed
much
of
that
mineral
industry
which
existed
in
the
roman
times
a
century
and
a
half
after
the
conquest
had
elapsed
before
the
norman
kings
had
a
revenue
from
the
cornish
iron
mines
iron
forges
were
registered
and
lumps
of
hammered
iron
are
stated
to
have
been
paid
as
rent
lead
works
are
found
only
upon
the

demesne
in
derbyshire
fisheries

important
sources
of

payments
of

are
enumerated
by
hundreds

to
have

kent
sussex

appear
to
have
been
the
great

of
this

the
severn
and
the
wye
had
their
salmon
fisheries
whose
produce
king
bishop
and

were
glad
to
receive
as
rent
there
was
a
weir
for
thames
fish
at
mortlake
the
religious
houses
had
their
and
their
stews
and
affords
us
many
curious
glimpses
of
the
condition
of
the
people
in
cities
and
burghs
for
the
most
part
they
seem
to
have
preserved
their
ancient
customs
london
winchester
and
several
other
important
places
are
not
mentioned
in
the
record
we
shall
very
briefly
notice
a
few
indications
of
the
state
of
society
dover
was
an
important
place
for
it
supplied
the
king
with
twenty
ships
for
fifteen
days
in
a
year
each
vessel
having
men
on
board
dover
could
therefore
command
the
service
of
four
hundred
and
twenty
mariners
every
burgess
in
lewes
compounded
for
a
payment
of
twenty
shillings
when
the
king
fitted
out
a
fleet
to
keep
the
sea
at
oxford
the
king
could
command
the
services
of
twenty
burgesses
whenever
he
went
on
an
expedition
or
they
might
compound
for
their
services
by
a
payment
of
twenty
pounds
oxford
was
a
considerable
place
at
this
period
it
contained
upward
of
seven
hundred
houses
but
four
hundred
and
were
so
desolated
that
they
could
pay
no
dues
hereford
was
the
king
demesne
and
the
honor
of
being
his
immediate
tenants
appears
to
have
been
qualified
by
considerable
exactions
when
he
went
to
war
and
when
he
went
to
hunt
men
were
to
be
ready
for
his
service
if
the
wife
of
a
burgher
brewed
his
ale
he
paid
tenpence
the
smith
who
kept
a
forge
had
to
make
nails
from
the
king
iron
in
hereford
as
in
other
cities
there
were
moneyers
or
coiners
there
were
seven
at
hereford
who
were
bound
to
coin
as
much
of
the
silver
into
pence
as
he
demanded
at
cambridge
the
burgesses
were
compelled
to
lend
the
sheriff
their
ploughs
leicester
was
bound
to
find
the
king
a
hawk
or
to
pay
ten
pounds
while
a
sumpter
or
was
compounded
for
at
one
pound
at
warwick
there
were
two
hundred
and
houses
on
which
the
king
and
his
barons
claimed
tax
and
nineteen
houses
belonged
to
free
burgesses
the
dues
were
paid
in
honey
and
corn
in
shrewsbury
there
were
two
hundred
and
houses
belonging
to
burgesses
but
the
burgesses
complained
that
they
were
called
upon
to
pay
as
much
tax
as
in
the
time
of
the
confessor
although
earl
roger
had
taken
possession
of
extensive
lands
for
building
his
castle
chester
was
a
port
in
which
the
king
had
his
dues
upon
every
cargo
and
where
he
had
fines
whenever
a
trader
was
detected
in
using
a
false
measure
the
fraudulent
female
brewer
of
adulterated
beer
was
placed
in
the
a
degradation
afterward
reserved
for
scolds
this
city
has
a
more
particular
notice
as
to
laws
and
customs
in
the
time
of
the
confessor
than
any
other
place
in
the
survey
particular
care
seems
to
have
been
taken
against
fire
the
owner
of
a
house
on
fire
not
only
paid
a
fine
to
the
king
but
forfeited
two
shillings
to
his
nearest
neighbor
marten
skins
appear
to
have
been
a
great
article
of
trade
in
this
city
no
stranger
could
cart
goods
within
a
particular
part
of
the
city
without
being
subjected
to
a
forfeiture
of
four
shillings
or
two
oxen
to
the
bishop
we
find
as
might
be
expected
no
mention
of
that
peculiar
architecture
of
chester
called
the
rows
which
has
so
puzzled
antiquarian
writers
the
probability
is
that
in
a
place
so
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
the
welsh
they
were
intended
for
defence
the
low
streets
in
which
the
rows
are
situated
have
the
road
considerably
beneath
them
like
the
cutting
of
a
railway
and
from
the
covered
way
of
the
rows
an
enemy
in
the
road
beneath
might
be
assailed
with
great
advantage
in
the
civil
wars
of
charles
i
the
possession
of
the
rows
by
the
royalists
or
parliamentary
troops
was
fiercely
contested
of
their
antiquity
there
is
no
doubt
they
probably
belong
to
the
same
period
as
the
castle
the
wall
of
chester
and
the
bridge
were
kept
in
repair
according
to
the
survey
by
the
service
of
one
laborer
for
every
hide
of
land
in
the
county
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
in
all
the
cities
and
burghs
the
inhabitants
are
described
as
belonging
to
the
king
or
a
bishop
or
a
baron
many
even
in
the
most
privileged
places
were
attached
to
particular
manors
the
survey
shows
that
in
some
towns
there
was
an
admixture
of
norman
and
english
burgesses
and
it
is
clear
that
they
were
so
settled
after
the
conquest
for
a
distinction
is
made
between
the
old
customary
dues
of
the
place
and
those
the
foreigner
should
pay
the
foreigner
had
to
bear
a
small
addition
to
the
ancient
charge
no
doubt
the
norman
clung
to
many
of
the
habits
of
his
own
land
and
the
saxon
unwillingly
parted
with
those
of
the
locality
in
which
his
fathers
had
lived
but
their
manners
were
gradually
assimilated
the
normans
grew
fond
of
the
english
beer
and
the
english
adopted
the
norman
dress
the
survey
of
affords
the
most
complete
evidence
of
the
extent
to
which
the
normans
had
possessed
themselves
of
the
landed
property
of
the
country
the
ancient
demesnes
of
the
crown
consisted
of
fourteen
hundred
and
manors
but
the
king
had
confiscated
the
properties
of
godwin
harold
algar
edwin
morcar
and
other
great
saxon
earls
and
his
revenues
thus
became
enormous
ordericus
vitalis
states
with
a
minuteness
that
seems
to
imply
the
possession
of
official
information
that
the
king
himself
received
daily
pounds
thirty
thousand
pence
and
three
farthings
sterling
money
from
his
regular
revenues
in
england
alone
independently
of
presents
fines
for
offences
and
many
other
matters
which
constantly
enrich
a
royal
treasury
the
numbers
of
manors
held
by
the
favorites
of
the
conqueror
would
appear
incredible
if
we
did
not
know
that
these
great
nobles
were
grasping
and
unscrupulous
indulging
the
grossest
sensuality
with
a
pretence
of
refinement
limited
in
their
perpetration
of
injustice
only
by
the
extent
of
their
power
and
so
blinded
by
their
pride
as
to
call
their
plunder
their
inheritance
ten
norman
chiefs
who
held
under
the
crown
are
enumerated
in
the
survey
as
possessing
two
thousand
eight
hundred
and
twenty
manors
this
enormous
transfer
of
property
did
not
take
place
without
the
most
formidable
resistance
but
when
a
period
of
tranquillity
arrived
came
the
era
of
the
saxons
had
their
rude
fortresses
and
intrenched
earthworks
but
solid
walls
of
stone
for
defence
and
residence
were
to
become
the
local
seats
of
regal
and
baronial
domination
contains
notices
of
castles
but
only
one
is
mentioned
as
having
existed
in
the
time
of
edward
the
confessor
some
which
the
conqueror
is
known
to
have
built
are
not
noticed
in
the
survey
among
these
is
the
white
tower
of
london
the
site
of
rochester
castle
is
mentioned
these
two
buildings
are
associated
by
our
old
antiquaries
as
being
erected
by
the
same
architect
stow
says
i
find
in
a
fair
of
the
acts
of
the
bishops
of
rochester
set
down
by
edmund
of
hadenham
that
william
i
surnamed
conqueror
builded
the
tower
of
london
to
wit
the
great
white
and
square
tower
there
about
the
year
of
christ
appointing
gundulph
then
bishop
of
rochester
to
be
principal
surveyor
and
overseer
of
that
work
who
was
for
that
time
lodged
in
the
house
of
edmere
a
burghess
of
london
the
chapel
in
the
white
tower
is
a
remarkable
specimen
of
early
norman
architecture
the
keep
of
rochester
castle
so
picturesquely
situated
on
the
medway
was
not
a
mere
fortress
without
domestic
convenience
here
we
still
look
upon
the
remains
of
sculptured
columns
and
arches
we
see
where
there
were
spacious
fireplaces
in
the
walls
and
how
each
of
four
floors
was
served
with
water
by
a
well
the
third
story
contains
the
most
ornamental
portions
of
the
building
in
the
enumeration
of
castles
we
have
repeated
mention
of
houses
destroyed
and
lands
wasted
for
their
erection
at
cambridge
houses
are
recorded
to
have
been
thus
demolished
this
was
the
fortress
to
overawe
the
fen
districts
at
lincoln
a
hundred
and
mansions
were
destroyed
on
account
of
the
castle
in
the
ruins
of
all
these
castles
we
may
trace
their
general
plan
there
were
an
outer
court
an
inner
court
and
a
keep
round
the
whole
area
was
a
wall
with
parapets
and
loopholes
the
entrance
was
defended
by
an
outwork
or
barbacan
the
prodigious
strength
of
the
keep
is
the
most
remarkable
characteristic
of
these
fortresses
and
thus
many
of
these
towers
remain
stripped
of
every
interior
fitting
by
time
but
as
untouched
in
their
solid
construction
as
the
mounts
upon
which
they
stand
we
ascend
the
steep
steps
which
lead
to
the
ruined
keep
of
carisbrook
with
all
our
historical
associations
directed
to
the
confinement
of
charles
i
in
this
castle
but
this
fortress
was
registered
in
five
centuries
and
a
half
had
elapsed
between
william
i
and
james
i
the
norman
keep
was
out
of
harmony
with
the
principles
of
the
seventeenth
century
as
much
as
the
feudal
prerogatives
to
which
charles
unhappily
clung
we
have
thus
enumerated
some
of
the
more
prominent
statistics
of
this
ancient
survey
which
are
truly
as
much
matter
of
history
as
the
events
of
this
beginning
of
the
norman
period
there
is
one
more
feature
of
this
which
we
can
not
pass
over
the
number
of
parish
churches
in
england
in
the
eleventh
century
will
in
some
degree
furnish
an
indication
of
the
amount
of
religious
instruction
by
some
most
extraordinary
exaggeration
the
number
of
these
churches
has
been
stated
to
be
above
thousand
in
the
number
enumerated
is
a
little
above
seventeen
hundred
no
doubt
this
enumeration
is
extremely
imperfect
very
nearly
half
of
all
the
churches
put
down
are
found
in
lincolnshire
norfolk
and
suffolk
the
in
some
cases
gives
the
amount
of
land
with
which
the
church
was
endowed
bosham
in
sussex
the
estate
of
harold
had
in
the
time
of
king
edward
a
hundred
and
twelve
hides
of
land
at
the
date
of
the
survey
it
had
hides
this
was
an
enormous
endowment
some
churches
had
five
acres
only
some
fifty
some
a
hundred
some
are
without
land
altogether
but
whether
the
endowment
be
large
or
small
here
is
the
evidence
of
a
church
planted
upon
the
same
foundation
as
the
monarchy
that
of
territorial
possessions
the
politic
ruler
of
england
had
in
the
completion
of
possessed
himself
of
the
most
perfect
instrument
for
the
profitable
administration
of
his
government
he
was
no
longer
working
in
the
dark
whether
he
called
out
soldiers
or
levied
taxes
he
had
carried
through
a
great
measure
rapidly
and
with
a
minuteness
which
puts
to
shame
some
of
our
clumsy
modern
statistics
but
the
conqueror
did
not
want
his
books
for
the
gratification
of
official
curiosity
he
went
to
work
when
he
knew
how
many
he
could
command
and
how
many
men
they
could
bring
into
the
field
he
instituted
the
great
feudal
principle
of
his
ordinance
is
in
these
words
we
command
that
all
earls
barons
knights
sergeants
and
freemen
be
always
provided
with
horses
and
arms
as
they
ought
and
that
they
be
always
ready
to
perform
to
us
their
whole
service
in
manner
as
they
owe
it
to
us
of
right
for
their
fees
and
tenements
and
as
we
have
appointed
to
them
by
the
common
council
of
our
whole
kingdom
and
as
we
have
granted
to
them
in
fee
with
right
of
inheritance
these
words
in
fee
with
right
of
inheritance
leave
no
doubt
that
the
great
vassals
of
the
crown
were
absolute
proprietors
and
that
all
their
subvassals
had
the
same
right
of
holding
in
perpetuity
the
estate
however
reverted
to
the
crown
if
the
race
of
the
original
feoffee
became
extinct
and
in
cases
also
of
felony
and
treason
when
alain
of
bretagne
who
commanded
the
rear
of
the
army
at
the
battle
of
hastings
and
who
had
received
four
hundred
and
manors
bowed
before
the
king
at
salisbury
at
the
great
council
in
and
swore
to
be
true
to
him
against
all
manner
of
men
he
also
brought
with
him
his
principal
men
who
also
bowed
before
the
king
and
became
his
men
they
had
previously
taken
the
oath
of
fealty
to
alain
of
bretagne
and
engaged
to
perform
all
the
customs
and
services
due
to
him
for
their
lands
and
tenements
alain
and
his
men
were
proprietors
but
with
very
unequal
rights
alain
by
his
tenure
was
bound
to
provide
for
the
king
as
many
armed
horsemen
as
the
vast
extent
of
his
estates
demanded
but
all
those
whom
he
had
enfeoffed
or
made
proprietors
upon
his
four
hundred
and
manors
were
each
bound
to
contribute
a
proportionate
number
when
the
free
service
of
forty
days
was
to
be
enforced
the
great
earl
had
only
to
send
round
to
his
vassals
and
the
men
were
at
his
command
by
this
organization
which
was
universal
throughout
the
kingdom
sixty
thousand
cavalry
could
with
little
delay
be
called
into
the
field
those
who
held
by
this
military
service
had
their
allotments
divided
into
so
many
knights
fees
and
each
knight
fee
was
to
furnish
one
mounted
and
armed
soldier
the
great
vassals
retained
a
portion
of
their
land
as
their
demesnes
having
tenants
who
paid
rents
and
performed
services
not
military
but
under
any
circumstances
the
vassal
of
the
crown
was
bound
to
perform
his
whole
free
service
with
men
and
horses
and
arms
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
this
wonderful
organization
rendered
the
whole
system
of
government
one
great
confederacy
in
which
the
small
proprietors
tenants
and
villeins
had
not
a
chance
of
independence
and
that
their
condition
could
only
be
ameliorated
by
those
gradual
changes
which
result
from
a
long
intercourse
between
the
strong
and
the
weak
in
which
power
relaxes
its
severity
and
becomes
protection
in
the
ordinance
in
which
the
king
commanded
free
service
he
also
says
we
will
that
all
the
freemen
of
the
kingdom
possess
their
lands
in
peace
free
from
all
tallage
and
unjust
exaction
this
unhappily
for
the
freemen
was
little
more
than
a
theory
under
the
norman
kings
there
were
various
modes
of
making
legal
exaction
the
source
of
the
grossest
injustice
when
the
heir
of
an
estate
entered
into
possession
he
had
to
pay
a
relief
or
to
the
lord
this
soon
became
a
source
of
oppression
in
the
crown
and
enormous
sums
were
exacted
from
the
great
vassals
the
lord
was
not
more
sparing
of
his
men
he
had
another
mode
of
extortion
he
demanded
aid
on
many
occasions
such
as
the
marriage
of
his
eldest
daughter
or
when
he
made
his
eldest
son
a
knight
the
estate
of
inheritance
which
looks
so
generous
and
equitable
an
arrangement
was
a
perpetual
grievance
for
the
possessor
could
neither
transmit
his
property
by
will
nor
transfer
it
by
sale
the
heir
however
remote
in
blood
was
the
only
legitimate
successor
the
feudal
obligation
to
the
lord
was
in
many
other
ways
a
fruitful
source
of
tyranny
which
lasted
up
to
the
time
of
the
stuarts
if
the
heir
were
a
minor
the
lord
entered
into
possession
of
the
estate
without
any
accountability
if
it
descended
to
a
female
the
lord
could
compel
her
to
marry
according
to
his
will
or
could
prevent
her
marrying
during
a
long
period
all
these
harassing
obligations
connected
with
property
were
upheld
the
crown
and
the
nobles
were
equally
interested
in
their
enforcement
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
though
the
great
vassals
sometimes
suffered
under
these
feudal
obligations
to
the
king
the
inferior
tenants
had
a
much
greater
amount
of
oppression
to
endure
at
the
hands
of
their
immediate
lords
but
if
the
freemen
were
oppressed
in
the
tenure
of
their
property
we
can
scarcely
expect
that
the
landless
man
had
not
much
more
to
suffer
if
he
committed
an
offence
in
the
saxon
time
he
paid
a
mulct
if
in
the
norman
he
was
subjected
to
an
his
whole
personal
estate
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
lord
having
thus
obtained
a
general
notion
of
the
system
of
society
established
in
less
than
twenty
years
after
the
conquest
we
see
that
there
was
nothing
wanting
to
complete
the
most
entire
subjection
of
the
great
body
of
the
nation
what
had
been
wanting
was
accomplished
in
the
practical
working
out
of
the
theory
that
the
entire
land
of
the
country
belonged
to
the
king
it
was
now
established
that
every
should
do
homage
to
the
king
that
every
superior
tenant
should
do
homage
to
his
lord
that
every
villein
should
be
the
bondman
of
the
free
and
that
every
slave
should
without
any
property
however
limited
and
insecure
be
the
absolute
chattel
of
some
master
the
whole
system
was
connected
with
military
service
this
was
the
feudal
system
there
was
some
resemblance
to
it
in
parts
of
the
saxon
organization
but
under
that
organization
there
was
so
much
of
freedom
in
the
allodial
or
free
tenure
of
land
that
a
great
deal
of
other
freedom
went
with
it
the
of
the
chains
of
feudality
was
the
labor
of
six
centuries
decline
of
the
moorish
power
in
spain
growth
and
decay
of
the
almoravide
and
almohade
dynasties
dunham
during
the
early
part
of
the
eleventh
century
the
western
caliphate
which
with
its
splendid
capital
of
cordova
had
flourished
for
almost
three
hundred
years
entered
upon
a
decline
that
was
the
beginning
of
its
final
dissolution
by
the
local
governors
openly
asserted
their
independence
of
cordova
and
assumed
the
title
of
kings
conspicuous
among
them
was
mahomet
ben
ismail
ben
abid
the
of
seville
while
these
petty
rulers
were
determined
to
renounce
allegiance
to
cordova
it
was
resolved
at
that
capital
to
elect
a
sovereign
to
subdue
them
and
restore
the
ancient
splendor
of
the
empire
the
choice
fell
upon
gehwar
ben
mahomet
who
soon
established
a
degree
of
tranquillity
and
commercial
prosperity
unknown
for
many
years
but
he
failed
to
reëstablish
the
supremacy
of
cordova
which
capital
mahomet
of
seville
was
preparing
to
invade
when
he
died
his
son
mahomet
almoateded
having
subdued
southern
andalusia
became
the
ally
of
mahomet
son
and
successor
of
gehwar
on
the
throne
of
cordova
but
he
betrayed
the
latter
under
pretence
of
aiding
him
against
his
enemies
and
usurped
the
sovereignty
on
the
death
of
mahomet
almoateded
his
son
mahomet
succeeded
him
at
cordova
he
was
already
king
of
seville
and
as
he
soon
occupied
many
other
cities
he
became
the
most
independent
and
powerful
sovereign
of
mahometan
spain
his
chief
rival
yahia
alkadia
king
of
toledo
was
so
contemptible
to
his
people
that
they
expelled
him
he
appealed
for
aid
to
alfonso
vi
king
of
leon
alfonso
of
castile
but
that
christian
soldier
was
persuaded
by
mahomet
to
oppose
instead
of
assisting
yahia
the
latter
was
restored
to
his
throne
by
the
king
of
badajoz
but
alfonso
invested
toledo
and
after
a
siege
reduced
the
city
in
in
the
history
of
the
events
directly
following
the
capitulation
it
is
shown
how
costly
to
himself
was
the
alliance
of
mahomet
with
alfonso
and
how
it
played
its
part
in
the
coming
of
his
coreligionists
from
africa
to
his
assistance
and
finally
as
it
proved
to
his
own
undoing
and
the
supplanting
of
the
power
he
represented
in
the
mahometan
government
of
spain
the
fall
of
toledo
however
it
might
have
been
foreseen
by
the
mahometans
filled
them
with
equal
dismay
and
indignation
as
mahomet
was
too
formidable
to
be
openly
assailed
they
turned
their
vociferations
of
anger
against
his
whom
they
accused
of
betraying
the
faith
of
islam
alarmed
at
the
universal
outcry
mahomet
was
not
sorry
that
he
could
devolve
the
heavy
load
of
responsibility
on
the
shoulders
of
his
minister
the
latter
fled
but
though
he
procured
a
temporary
asylum
from
several
princes
he
was
at
length
seized
by
the
emissaries
of
his
offended
master
was
brought
first
to
cordova
next
to
seville
confined
within
the
walls
of
a
dungeon
and
soon
beheaded
by
the
royal
hand
of
mahomet
thus
was
a
servant
of
the
king
sacrificed
for
no
other
reason
than
that
he
had
served
that
king
too
well
the
conquest
of
toledo
was
far
from
satisfying
the
ambition
of
alfonso
he
rapidly
seized
on
the
fortresses
of
madrid
maqueda
guadalaxara
and
established
his
dominion
on
both
banks
of
the
tagus
mahomet
now
began
seriously
to
repent
his
treaty
with
the
christian
and
to
tremble
even
for
his
own
possessions
he
vainly
endeavored
to
divert
his
ally
from
the
projects
of
aggrandizement
which
that
ally
had
evidently
formed
the
kings
of
badajoz
and
saragossa
became
tributaries
to
the
latter
nay
if
any
reliance
is
to
be
placed
on
either
christian
or
arabic
historians
the
king
of
seville
himself
was
subjected
to
the
same
humiliation
however
this
may
have
been
mahomet
saw
that
unless
he
leagued
himself
with
those
whose
subjugation
had
hitherto
been
his
constant
object
the
princes
of
his
faith
his
and
their
destruction
was
inevitable
the
magnitude
of
the
danger
compelled
him
to
solicit
their
alliance
footnote
condé
gives
the
translation
of
two
letters
one
from
alfonso
to
mahomet
distinguished
for
a
tone
of
superiority
and
even
of
arrogance
which
could
arise
only
from
the
confidence
felt
by
the
writer
in
his
own
strength
the
other
from
mahomet
to
alfonso
containing
a
defiance
the
latter
begins
to
the
proud
enemy
of
allah
alfonso
ben
sancho
who
calls
himself
lord
of
both
nations
and
both
laws
may
god
confound
his
arrogance
and
prosper
those
who
walk
in
the
right
way
one
passage
of
the
same
letter
says
fatigued
with
war
we
were
willing
to
offer
thee
an
annual
tribute
but
this
does
not
satisfy
thee
thou
wishest
us
to
deliver
into
thine
hands
our
towns
and
fortresses
but
are
we
thy
subjects
that
thou
makest
such
demands
or
hast
thou
ever
subdued
us
thine
injustice
has
roused
us
from
our
lethargy
etc
as
the
king
of
saragossa
was
too
much
in
fear
of
the
christians
to
enter
into
any
league
against
them
and
as
the
one
of
valencia
yahia
reigned
only
at
the
pleasure
of
alfonso
the
sovereigns
of
badajoz
almeria
and
granada
were
the
only
powers
on
whose
coöperation
he
could
calculate
he
had
annihilated
the
authority
of
several
petty
kings
he
invited
those
princes
to
send
their
representatives
to
seville
to
consult
as
to
the
measures
necessary
to
protect
their
threatened
independence
the
invitation
was
readily
accepted
on
the
day
appointed
mahomet
with
his
son
al
raxid
and
a
considerable
number
of
his
and
was
present
at
the
deliberations
the
danger
was
so
imminent
the
force
of
the
christians
was
so
augmented
and
that
of
the
moslems
so
weakened
that
such
resistance
as
mahometan
spain
alone
could
offer
seemed
hopeless
with
this
conviction
in
their
hearts
two
of
the
most
influential
cadis
proposed
an
appeal
to
the
celebrated
african
conqueror
yussef
ben
taxfin
whose
arm
alone
seemed
able
to
preserve
the
faith
of
islam
in
the
peninsula
the
proposal
was
received
with
general
applause
by
all
present
they
did
not
make
the
very
obvious
reflection
that
when
a
nation
admits
into
its
bosom
an
ally
more
powerful
than
itself
it
admits
at
the
same
time
a
conqueror
the
wali
of
malaga
alone
abdallah
ben
zagut
had
courage
to
oppose
the
dangerous
embassy
under
consideration
you
mean
to
call
in
the
aid
of
the
almoravides
are
you
ignorant
that
these
fierce
inhabitants
of
the
desert
resemble
their
own
native
tigers
suffer
them
not
i
beseech
you
to
enter
the
fertile
plains
of
andulasia
and
granada
doubtless
they
would
break
the
iron
sceptre
which
alfonso
intends
for
us
but
you
would
still
be
doomed
to
wear
the
chains
of
slavery
do
you
not
know
that
yussef
has
taken
all
the
cities
of
almagreb
that
he
has
subdued
the
powerful
tribes
of
the
east
and
west
that
he
has
everywhere
substituted
despotism
for
liberty
and
independence
the
aged
zagut
spoke
in
vain
he
was
even
accused
of
being
a
secret
partisan
of
the
christian
and
the
embassy
was
decreed
but
zagut
was
not
the
only
one
who
foresaw
the
catastrophe
to
which
that
embassy
must
inevitably
lead
al
raxid
shared
the
same
prophetic
feeling
in
reply
to
his
father
who
after
the
separation
of
the
assembly
expatiated
on
the
absolute
necessity
of
soliciting
the
alliance
of
aben
taxfin
as
the
only
measure
capable
of
saving
the
rest
of
mahometan
spain
from
the
yoke
of
alfonso
he
said
this
aben
taxfin
who
has
subdued
all
that
he
pleased
will
serve
us
as
he
has
already
served
the
people
of
almagreb
and
mauritania
he
will
expel
us
from
our
country
anything
rejoined
the
father
rather
than
andalusia
should
become
the
prey
of
the
christians
dost
thou
wish
the
mussulmans
to
curse
me
i
would
rather
become
an
humble
shepherd
a
driver
of
yussef
camels
than
reign
dependent
on
these
christian
dogs
but
my
trust
is
in
allah
may
allah
protect
both
thee
and
thy
people
replied
al
raxid
mournfully
who
saw
that
the
die
of
fate
was
cast
the
course
of
this
history
must
be
interrupted
for
a
moment
while
the
origin
and
exploits
of
this
formidable
african
are
recorded
beyond
the
chain
of
mount
atlas
in
the
deserts
of
ancient
getulia
dwelt
two
tribes
of
arabian
descent
both
probably
of
the
greater
one
of
zanhaga
so
illustrious
in
arabian
history
at
what
time
they
had
been
expelled
or
had
voluntarily
exiled
themselves
from
their
native
yemen
they
knew
not
but
tradition
taught
them
that
they
had
been
located
in
the
african
deserts
from
ages
immemorial
their
life
was
passed
under
the
tent
their
only
possessions
were
their
camels
and
their
freedom
yahia

ibrahim
belonging
to
one
of
these
tribes

the
pilgrimage
of
mecca
on

cairwan

became

with
a
famous
originally
of
fez
being
questioned
by
his
new
friend
as
to
the
religion
and
manners
of
his
countrymen
he
replied
that
they
were
sunk
in
ignorance
both
from
their
isolated
situation
in
the
desert
and
from
their
want
of
teachers
he
added
however
that
they
were
strangers
to
cruelty
and
that
they
would
be
willing
enough
to
receive
instruction
from
any
quarter
he
even
entreated
the
alfaqui
to
allow
some
one
of
his
disciples
to
accompany
him
into
his
native
country
but
none
of
those
disciples
was
willing
to
undertake
so
long
and
perilous
a
journey
and
it
was
not
without
considerable
difficulty
that
abdallah
ben
yassim
the
disciple
of
another
alfaqui
was
persuaded
to
accompany
the
patriotic
yahia
abdallah
was
one
of
those
ruling
minds
which
fortunately
for
the
peace
of
society
nature
so
seldom
produces
seeing
his
enthusiastic
reception
by
the
tribe
of
gudala
and
the
influence
he
was
sure
of
maintaining
over
it
he
formed
the
design
of
founding
a
sovereignty
in
the
heart
of
these
vast
regions
under
the
pretext
that
to
diffuse
a
holy
religion
and
useful
knowledge
was
among
the
most
imperative
of
duties
he
prevailed
on
his
obedient
disciples
to
make
war
on
the
kindred
tribe
of
lamtuna
that
tribe
submitted
acknowledging
his
spiritual
authority
and
zealously
assisted
him
in
his
great
purpose
of
gaining
proselytes
by
the
sword
his
ambition
naturally
increased
with
his
success
in
a
short
time
he
had
reduced
in
a
similar
manner
the
isolated
tribes
around
him
to
his
valiant
followers
of
lamtuna

now
gave
the
name
of
or
which
signifies
men
consecrated
to
the
service

this
moslem
dynasty

until
when
it
was
overthrown
and
succeeded
by
that
of
the
almohades
the
whole
country
of
darah
was
gradually
subdued
by
this
new
apostle
and
his
authority
was
acknowledged
over
a
region
extensive
enough

respectable
kingdom
but
though
he
exercised
all
the
rights

he
prudently
abstained
from
assuming
the
title
he
left
to
the
emir
of
lamtuna
the
ostensible
exercise
of
temporal
power
and
when
in
that
emir
fell
in
battle
he
nominated
ben

to
the
vacant
dignity
his
own
death
which
was
that
of
a
warrior
left
in
possession
of
an
undivided
sovereignty
the
power
and
consequently
the
reputation
of
the
emir
spread
far
and
wide
and
numbers
flocked
from
distant
provinces
to
share
in
the
advantages
of
religion
and
plunder
his
native
plains
were
now
too
narrow
for
the
ambition
of
who
crossed
the
chain
of
mount
atlas
and
fixed
his
residence
in
the
city
of
agmat
between
those
mountains
and
the
sea
but
even
this
place
was
soon
too
confined
for
his
increased
subjects
and
he
looked
round
for
a
site
on
which
he
might
lay
the
foundations
of
a
great
city
the
destined
metropolis
of
a
great
empire
one
was
at
length
found
and
the
city
of
morocco
began
to
rear
its
head
from
the
valley
of
eylana
before
however
his
great
work
was
half
completed
he
received
intelligence
that
the
tribe
of
gudala
had
declared
a
deadly
war
against
that
of
lamtuna
and
that
the
ruin
of
one
at
least
of
the
hostile
people
was
to
be
apprehended
as
he
belonged
to
the
latter
he
naturally
trembled
for
the
fate
of
his
kindred
and
at
the
head
of
his
cavalry
he
departed
for
his
native
deserts
leaving
the
superintendence
of
the
buildings
and
the
command
of
the
army
during
his
absence
to
his
cousin
yussef
ben
taxfin
the
person
and
character
of
yussef
are
drawn
in
the
most
favorable
colors
by
the
arabian
writers
we
are
told
that
his
stature
was
tall
and
noble
his
countenance
prepossessing
his
eye
dark
and
piercing
his
beard
long
his
tone
of
voice
harmonious
his
whole
frame
which
no
sickness
ever
assailed
strong
robust
and
familiar
with
fatigue
that
his
mind
corresponded
with
his
outward
appearance
his
generosity
his
care
of
the
poor
his
sobriety
his
justice
his
religious
zeal
yet
freedom
from
intolerance
rendering
him
the
admiration
of
foreigners
and
the
love
of
his
own
people
but
whatever
were
his
other
virtues
it
will
be
seen
that
gratitude
honor
and
good
faith
were
not
among
the
number
scarcely
had
his
kinsman
left
the
city
than
in
pursuance
of
the
design
he
had
formed
of
usurping
the
supreme
authority
he
began
to
win
the
affection
of
the
troops
partly
by
his
gifts
and
partly
by
that
winning
affability
of
manner
which
he
could
easily
assume
how
well
he
succeeded
will
soon
appear
nor
was
his
success
in
war
less
agreeable
to
so
fierce
and
martial
a
people
as
the
almoravides
the
berbers
who
inhabited
the
defiles
of
mount
atlas
and
who
animated
by
the
spirit
of
independence
so
characteristic
of
mountaineers
endeavored
to
vindicate
their
natural
liberty
were
quickly
subdued
by
him
but
his
policy
was
still
superior
he
had
long
loved
or
at
least
long
aspired
to
the
hope
of
marrying
the
beautiful
zainab
sister
of
but
the
fear
of
a
repulse
from
the
proud
chief
of
his
family
had
caused
him
to
smother
his
inclination
he
now
disdained
to
supplicate
for
that
chief
consent
he
married
the
lady
and
from
that
moment
proceeded
boldly
in
his
projects
of
ambition
having
put
the
finishing
touch
to
his
magnificent
city
of
morocco
he
transferred
thither
the
seat
of
his
empire
and
by
the
encouragement
he
afforded
to
individuals
of
all
nations
who
chose
to
settle
there
he
soon
filled
it
with
a
prosperous
and
numerous
population
the
augmentation
of
his
army
was
his
next
great
object
and
so
well
did
he
succeed
in
it
that
on
his
departure
in
a
hostile
expedition
against
fez
he
found
his
troops
exceeded
one
hundred
thousand
with
so
formidable
a
force
he
had
little
difficulty
in
rapidly
extending
his
conquests
yussef
had
just
completed
the
subjugation
of
fez
when
returned
from
the
desert
and
encamped
in
the
vicinity
of
agmat
he
was
soon
made
acquainted
probably
common
report
had
acquainted
him
long
before
with
the
usurpation
of
his
kinsman
with
a
force
so
far
inferior
to
his
rival
and
still
more
with
the
conviction
that
the
hearts
of
the
people
were
weaned
from
him
he
might
well
hesitate
as
to
the
course
he
should
adopt
his
greatest
mortification
was
to
hear
his
own
horsemen
whom
curiosity
drew
into
morocco
loud
in
the
praises
of
yussef
whose
liberality
to
the
army
was
the
theme
of
universal
admiration
and
whose
service
for
that
reason
many
avowed
their
intention
of
embracing
he
now
feared
that
his
power
was
at
an
end
yet
he
resolved
to
have
an
interview
with
his
cousin
the
two
chiefs
met
about
between
morocco
and
agmat
and
after
a
formal
salutation
took
their
seats
on
the
same
carpet
the
appearance
of
yussef
formidable
guard
the
alacrity
with
which
he
was
obeyed
and
the
grandeur
which
surrounded
him
convinced
that
the
throne
of
the
usurper
was
too
firmly
established
to
be
shaken
the
poor
emir
so
far
from
demanding
the
restitution
of
his
rights
durst
not
even
utter
one
word
of
complaint
on
the
contrary
he
pretended
that
he
had
long
renounced
empire
and
that
his
only
wish
was
to
pass
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
the
retirement
of
the
desert
with
equal
hypocrisy
yussef
humbly
thanked
him
for
his
abdication
the
sheiks
and
walis
were
summoned
to
witness
the
renewed
declaration
of
the
emir
after
which
the
two
princes
separated
the
following
day
however
received
a
magnificent
present
from
yussef
who
indeed
continued
to
send
him
one
every
year
to
the
period
of
his
death
footnote

distance

about
ten

to
consist

seventy

similar
situation
a
modern

sovereign
would
probably
have
sent
one
hundred
pounds
yussef
who
though
he
had
refused
to
receive
the
title
of
which
he
considered
as
properly
belonging
to
the
caliph
of
the
east
had
just
exchanged
his
humble
one
of
emir
for
those
of
or
prince
of
the
believers
and
of
or
defender
of
the
faith
when
the
letters
of
mahomet
reached
him
a
similar
application
from
omar
king
of
badajoz
he
had
disregarded
not
because
he
was
indifferent
to
the
glory
of
serving
his
religion
still
less
to
the
advantage
of
extending
his
conquests
but
because
he
had
not
then
sufficiently
consolidated
his
power
now
however
he
was
in
peaceful
possession
of
an
extended
empire
and
he
assembled
his
chiefs
to
hear
their
sentiments
on
an
expedition
which
he
had
resolved
to
undertake
all
immediately
exclaimed
that
war
should
be
undertaken
in
defence
of
the
tottering
throne
of
islam
before
however
he
returned
a
final
answer
to
the
king
of
seville
he
insisted
that
the
fortress
of
algeziras
should
be
placed
in
his
hands
on
the
pretence
that
if
fortune
were
unpropitious
he
should
have
some
place
to
which
he
might
retreat
that
mahomet
should
have
been
so
blind
as
to
not
perceive
the
designs
involved
in
the
insidious
proposal
is
almost
enough
to
make
one
agree
with
the
arabic
historians
that
destiny
had
decreed
he
should
fall
by
his
own
measures
the
place
was
not
only
surrendered
to
the
artful
moor
but
mahomet
himself
went
to
morocco
to
hasten
the
departure
of
yussef
he
was
assured
of
speedy
succor
and
induced
to
return
he
was
soon
followed
by
the
ambitious
african
at
the
head
of
a
mighty
armament
alfonso
was
besieging
saragossa
which
he
had
every
expectation
of
reducing
when
intelligence
reached
him
of
yussef
disembarkation
he
resolved
to
meet
the
approaching
storm
at
the
head
of
all
the
forces
he
could
muster
he
advanced
toward
andalusia
and
encountered
yussef
on
the
plains
of
zalaca
between
badajoz
and
merida
as
the
latter
was
a
strict
observer
of
the
outward
forms
of
his
religion
he
summoned
the
christian
king
by
letter
to
embrace
the
faith
of
the
prophet
or
consent
to
pay
an
annual
tribute

the
onset
of
alfonso
at
the
head
of
the
christian
cavalry
was
so
fierce
that
the
ranks
of
the
almoravides
were
thrown
into
confusion
not
less
successful
was
sancho
king
of
navarre
against
the
andalusians
who
retreated
toward
badajoz
but
the
troops
of
seville
kept
the
field
and
fought
with
desperate
valor
they
would
however
have
given
way
had
not
yussef
at
this
critical
moment
advanced
with
his
reserve
and
his
own
guard
consisting
of
his
bravest
troops
and
assailed
the
christians
in
the
rear
and
flanks
this
unexpected
movement
decided
the
fortune
of
the
day
alfonso
was
severely
wounded
and
compelled
to
retreat
but
not
until
nightfall
nor
until
he
had
displayed
a
valor
worthy
of
the
greatest
heroes
though
his
own
loss
was
severe
amounting
according
to
the
arabians
to
thousand
men
that
of
the
enemy
could
scarcely
be
inferior
when
we
consider
that
this
victory
had
no
result
yussef
was
evidently
too
much
weakened
to
profit
by
it
not
long
after
the
battle
yussef
being
called
to
africa
by
the
death
of
a
son
the
command
of
the
almoravides
devolved
on
syr
ben
the
ablest
of
his
generals
that
general
advanced
northward
and
seized
some
insignificant
fortresses
but
the
advantage
was
but
temporary
and
was
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
disasters
of
the
following
year
the
king
of
saragossa
had
hoped
that
the
defeat
of
zalaca
would
prevent
the
christians
from
attacking
him
but
that
of
his
allies
the
mahometan
princes
in
the
neighborhood
and
the
taking
of
huesca
by
the
king
of
navarre
convinced
him
how
fallacious
was
his
fancied
security
seeing
that
no
advantage
whatever
had
accrued
from
his
former
expedition
yussef
now
proclaimed
the
alhiged
or
holy
war
and
invited
all
the
andalusian
princes
to
join
him
in
he
again
disembarked
at
algeziras
and
joined
the
confederates
but
this
present
demonstration
of
force
proved
as
useless
as
the
preceding
it
ended
in
nothing
owing
partly
to
the
dissensions
of
mahometans
and
partly
to
the
activity
of
the
christians
who
not
only
rendered
abortive
the
measures
of
the
enemy
but
gained
some
signal
advantages
over
them
yussef
was
forced
to
retreat
on
almeida
whether
through
the
distrust
of
the
mahometan
princes
who
appear
to
have
penetrated
his
intention
of
subjecting
them
to
his
empire
or
through
his
apprehension
of
alfonso
he
again
returned
to
africa
to
procure
new
and
more
considerable
levies
in
he
landed
a
third
time
at
algeziras
not
so
much
with
the
view
of
humbling
the
christian
king
as
of
executing
the
perfidious
design
he
had
so
long
harbored
for
form
sake
indeed
he
invested
toledo
but
he
could
have
entertained
no
expectation
of
reducing
it
and
when
he
perceived
that
the
andalusian
princes
refused
to
join
him
he
eagerly
left
that
city
and
proceeded
to
secure
far
dearer
and
easier
interests
he
openly
threw
off
the
mask
and
commenced
his
career
of
spoliation
the
king
of
granada
abdallah
ben
balkin
was
the
first
victim
to
african
perfidy
in
the
conviction
that
he
must
be
overwhelmed
if
resistance
were
offered
he
left
his
city
to
welcome
yussef
his
submission
was
vain
he
was
instantly
loaded
with
chains
and
with
his
family
sent
to
agmat
timur
ben
balkin
brother
of
abdallah
was
in
the
same
violent
manner
despoiled
of
malaga
mahomet
now
perceived
the
grievous
error
which
he
had
committed
and
the
prudent
foresight
of
his
son
al
raxid
did
not
i
tell
thee
said
the
latter
mournfully
what
the
consequences
would
be
that
we
should
be
driven
from
our
palace
and
country
thou
wert
indeed
a
true
prophet
replied
the
father
but
what
power
could
avert
the
decrees
of
fate
it
seemed
as
if
fate
had
indeed
resolved
that
this
but
misguided
prince
should
fall
by
his
own
obstinacy
for
though
his
son
advised
him
to
seek
the
alliance
of
alfonso
he
refused
to
do
so
until
that
alliance
could
no
longer
avail
him
he
himself
seemed
to
think
that
the
knell
of
his
departing
greatness
was
about
to
sound
and
the
most
melancholy
images
were
present
to
his
fancy
even
in
sleep
one
night
says
an
arabic
historian
he
heard
in
a
dream
his
ruin
predicted
by
one
of
his
sons
he
awoke
and
the
same
verses
were
repeated
fortune
carried
thee
in
her
car
of
triumph
and
thy
name
was
by
renown
spread
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
now
the
same
renown
conveys
only
thy
sighs
days
and
nights
pass
away
and
like
them
the
enjoyments
of
the
world
thy
greatness
has
vanished
like
a
dream
but
if
mahomet
was
superstitious
if
he
felt
that
fate
had
doomed
him
and
that
resistance
would
be
useless
he
resolved
not
to
fall
ignobly
his
defence
was
indeed
heroic
but
it
was
vain
even
though
alfonso
sent
him
an
aid
of
twenty
thousand
men
his
cities
fell
one
by
one
seville
was
constrained
to
capitulate
he
and
his
family
were
thrown
into
prison
until
a
ship
was
prepared
to
convey
them
into
africa
whither
their
perfidious
ally
had
retired
some
weeks
before
his
conduct
in
this
melancholy
reverse
of
fortune
is
represented
as
truly
great
not
a
sigh
escaped
him
except
for
the
innocent
companions
of
his
misfortune
especially
for
his
son
al
raxid
whose
virtues
and
talents
deserved
a
better
destiny
surrounded
by
the
best
beloved
of
his
wives
by
his
daughters
and
his
four
surviving
sons
he
endeavored
to
console
them
as
they
wept
on
seeing
his
royal
hands
oppressed
with
fetters
and
still
more
when
the
ship
conveyed
all
from
the
shores
of
spain
my
children
and
friends
said
the
suffering
monarch
let
us
learn
to
support
our
lot
with
resignation
in
this
state
of
being
our
enjoyments
are
but
lent
us
to
be
resumed
when
heaven
sees
fit
joy
and
sorrow
pleasure
and
pain
closely
follow
each
other
but
the
noble
heart
is
above
the
inconstancy
of
fortune
the
royal
party
disembarked
at
ceuta
and
were
conveyed
to
agmat
to
be
confined
in
a
fortress
we
are
told
that
on
their
journey
a
compassionate
poet
presented
the
fallen
king
with
a
copy
of
verses
deploring
his
misfortunes
and
that
he
rewarded
the
poet
with
pieces
of
gold
the
only
money
he
had
left
from
his
once
exhaustless
riches
he
had
little
apprehension
of
what
was
to
follow
that
yussef
would
leave
him
without
support
that
his
future
life
was
to
be
passed
in
penury
nay
that
his
daughters
would
be
compelled
to
earn
his
subsistence
and
their
own
by
the
labor
of
their
hands
yet
even
in
that
indigent
condition
says
aben
lebuna
and
through
the
sadness
which
covered
their
countenances
there
was
something
about
them
which
revealed
their
high
origin
the
unfortunate
monarch
outlived
the
loss
of
his
crown
and
liberty
about
four
years
after
the
fall
of
mahomet
the
general
of
yussef
had
little
difficulty
in
subduing
the
princes
of
andalusia
valencia
next
received
the
african
yoke
the
king
of
saragossa
was
more
fortunate
he
sent
ambassadors
to
yussef
bearing
rich
presents
and
proposing
an
alliance
with
a
common
league
against
the
christians
my
dominions
said
are
the
only
barrier
between
thee
and
the
christian
princes
hitherto
my
predecessors
and
myself
have
withstood
all
their
efforts
with
thy
succor
i
shall
fear
them
still
less
yussef
accepted
the
proposal
a
treaty
of
alliance
was
made
and
the
army
of
was
reinforced
by
a
considerable
body
of
amoravides
with
whom
he
repelled
an
invasion
of
sancho
king
of
aragon
a
third
division
of
the
africans
which
marched
to
destroy
the
sovereignty
of
algarve
and
badajoz
was
no
less
successful
badajoz
capitulated
but
in
violation
of
the
treaty
the
dethroned
omar
with
two
of
his
sons
was
surrounded
and
assassinated
by
a
body
of
cavalry
as
he
was
unsuspiciously
journeying
from
the
scene
of
his
past
prosperity
in
search
of
another
asylum
a
third
son
was
placed
in
close
confinement
thus
ended
the
petty
kingdoms
of
andalusia
after
a
stormy
existence
of
about
sixty
years
for
some
years
after
the
usurpation
of
yussef
peace
appears
to
have
existed
in
spain
between
the
mahometans
and
the
christians
fearing
a
new
irruption
of
africans
alfonso
contented
himself
with
fortifying
toledo
and
yussef
felt
little
inclination
to
renew
the
war
with
one
whose
prowess
he
had
so
fatally
experienced
but
christian
spain
was
at
one
moment
near
the
brink
of
ruin
the
passion
for
the
crusades
was
no
less
ardently
felt
by
the
spaniards
than
by
other
nations
of
europe
thousands
of
the
best
warriors
were
preparing
to
depart
for
the
holy
land
as
if
there
were
more
merit
in
contending
with
the
infidels
in
a
remote
region
for
a
barren
sepulchre
than
at
home
for
the
dearest
interests
of
man
for
honor
patriotism
and
religion
fortunately
for
spain
pope
pascal
ii
in
answer
to
the
representations
of
alfonso
declared
that
the
proper
post
of
every
spaniard
was
at
home
and
there
were
his
true
enemies
soon
afterward
yussef
returned
to
morocco
where
he
died
on
the
day
of
the
moon
muharram
after
living
one
hundred
arabian
or
about
christian
years
in
the
empire
of
the
almoravides
was
tottering
to
its
fall
it
had
never
been
agreeable
to
the
mahometans
of
spain
whose
manners
from
their
intercourse
with
a
civilized
people
were
comparatively
refined
the
sheiks
of
lamtuna
were
so
many
insupportable
tyrants
the
jews
the
universal
agents
for
the
collection
of
the
revenues
were
here
as
in
poland
the
most
pitiless
extortioners
every
savage
from
the
desert
looked
with
contempt
on
the
milder
inhabitant
of
the
peninsula
the
domination
of
these
strangers
was
indeed
so
odious
that
except
for
the
divisions
between
alfonso
and
his
ambitious
queen
donna
urraca
who
was
sovereign
in
her
own
right
all
andalusia
might
speedily
have
been
subjected
to
christian
rule
alfonso
the
king
of
aragon
fell
at
the
siege
of
fraga
about
but
the
almoravides
met
an
equally
valiant
foe
in
his
son
and
successor
alfonso
raymond
king
of
leon
and
castile
after
a
period
of
about
forty
years
during
which
the
christians
were
steadily
increasing
their
dominions
coria
and
mora
and
other
mahometan
strongholds
were
acquired
by
alfonso
now
styled
the
emperor
and
almost
every
contest
between
the
two
natural
enemies
had
turned
to
the
advantage
of
the
christians
so
long
indeed
as
the
walis
were
eager
only
to
preserve
or
to
extend
their
authority
independent
of
each
other
and
of
every
superior
this
success
need
not
surprise
us
we
may
rather
be
surprised
that
the
mahometans
were
allowed
to
retain
any
footing
in
the
peninsula
probably
they
would
at
this
time
have
been
driven
from
it
but
for
the
seasonable
arrival
of
the
victorious
almohades
both
christians
and
africans
now
contended
for
the
superiority
while
the
troops
of
alfonso
reduced
baeza
and
with
a
mahometan
ally
even
cordova
malaga
and
seville
acknowledged
abu
amram
calatrava
and
almeria
next
fell
to
the
christian
emperor
about
the
same
time
that
lisbon
and
the
neighboring
towns
received
don
enrique
the
new
sovereign
of
portugal
most
of
these
conquests
however
were
subsequently
recovered
by
the
almohades
being
reinforced
by
a
new
army
from
africa
the
latter
pursued
their
successes
with
greater
vigor
they
reduced
cordova
which
was
held
by
an
ally
of
alfonso
defeated
and
forever
paralyzed
the
expiring
efforts
of
the
almoravides
and
proclaimed
their
emperor
abdelmumen
as
sovereign
of
all
mahometan
spain
notwithstanding
the
destructive
wars
which
had
prevailed
for
nearly
a
century
neither
moors
nor
christians
had
acquired
much
advantage
by
them
from
the
reduction
of
saragossa
to
the
present
time
the
victory
indeed
had
generally
declared
for
the
christians
but
their
conquests
with
the
exception
of
lisbon
and
a
few
fortresses
in
central
spain
were
lost
almost
as
soon
as
gained
and
the
same
fate
attended
the
equally
transient
successes
of
the
mahometans
the
reasons
why
the
former
did
not
permanently
extend
their
territories
were
their
internal
dissensions
while
leon
was
at
war
with
castile
or
castile
with
leon
or
either
with
aragon
we
need
not
wonder
that
the
united
almoravides
or
their
successors
the
almohades
should
sometimes
triumph
but
those
triumphs
were
sure
to
be
followed
by
reverses
whenever
not
all
but
any
one
of
the
christian
states
was
at
liberty
to
assail
its
natural
enemy
the
christians
when
at
peace
among
themselves
were
always
too
many
for
their
mahometan
neighbors
even
when
the
latter
were
aided
by
the
whole
power
of
western
africa
in
about
the
king
of
castile
reduced
caenza
and
the
moors
were
defeated
before
toledo
the
following
year
the
portuguese
were
no
less
successful
before
abrantes
which
the
africans
had
besieged
these
disasters
roused
the
wrath
of
yussef
abu
yagur
son
and
successor
of
abdulmumen
who
died
but
as
an
obscure
rebellion
required
his
presence
at
that
time
in
mauritania
he
did
not
land
in
spain
until
he
marched
without
delay
against
santarem
which
his
soldiers
had
vainly
besieged
some
years
before
wishing
to
divide
the
portuguese
force
he
one
night
sent
an
order
to
his
son
cid
abu
ishac
who
lay
encamped
near
him
to
march
with
the
andalusian
cavalry
on
lisbon
the
officer
who
carried
the
order
instead
of
lisbon
named
seville
the
whole
moslem
army
were
sure
that
some
disaster
was
impending
and
that
the
siege
was
to
be
raised
before
morning
the
camp
was
deserted
the
guard
alone
of
yussef
remaining
while
he
despatched
orders
to
recall
the
alarmed
fugitives
the
christians
who
were
soon
aware
of
the
retreat
issued
from
the
walls
surrounded
and
massacred
the
guard
yussef
defended
himself
like
a
hero
six
of
the
advancing
assailants
he
laid
low
before
the
same
fate
was
inflicted
on
himself
the
merciless
carnage
of
the
christians
spared
not
even
his
female
attendants
at
this
moment
two
companies
of
cavalry
arrived
and
finding
their
monarch
dying
furiously
charged
the
christians
whom
they
soon
put
to
flight
in
a
few
hours
the
whole
army
returned
and
inspired
with
the
same
hope
of
vengeance
they
stormed
and
took
the
place
and
put
every
living
creature
to
the
sword
yacub
ben
yussef
from
his
victories
afterward
named
almansor
who
was
then
in
spain
was
immediately
declared
successor
to
his
father
for
some
years
he
was
not
personally
opposed
to
the
christians
though
his
walis
carried
on
a
desultory
indecisive
war
he
was
long
detained
in
africa
first
in
quelling
some
domestic
commotions
and
afterward
by
severe
illness
he
was
scarcely
recovered
when
the
intelligence
that
the
christians
were
making
insulting
irruptions
to
the
very
outworks
of
algeziras
made
him
resolve
on
punishing
their
audacity
his
preparations
were
of
the
most
formidable
description
in
he
landed
in
andalusia
and
proceeded
toward
valencia
where
the
christian
army
then
lay
there
alfonso
viii
king
of
castile
was
awaiting
the
expected
reinforcements
from
his
allies
the
kings
of
leon
and
navarre
both
armies
pitched
their
tents
on
the
plains
of
alarcon
the
following
day
the
christians
commenced
the
attack
and
with
so
much
impetuosity
that
the
centre
was
soon
broken
but
an
andalusian
chief
conducted
a
strong
body
of
his
men
against
alfonso
who
with
the
reserve
occupied
the
hill
above
the
plain
while
the
struggle
was
in

the

ascended

themselves
on

descended
into

up

with

defended

iron
chains

surrounded

impenetrable
guard

held

thousand

made
a
determined
stand
and
though
it
was
broken
it
soon
rallied
on
being
reinforced
from
the
reserve
at
one
time
indeed
the
superiority
of
numbers
was
so
great
on
the
part
of
the
moslems
that
the
troops
of
alfonso
appeared
about
to
give
way
at
this
moment
that
king
addressing
the
archbishop

was

prelate
however
and
a

him
by
the
bridle
of
his

the
rashness
of
his
purpose

a

new
character

to

at

great
numbers

pilgrims
for
centuries
had
passed
to
visit

with

condition
of

which
led
to
an
extension
of
commerce
in
the

the
pilgrimage
to
that
part
of

acquired
a
new
importance
as
early
as
a

of

made
their

where

arose
the
cry
for
vengeance
and
men
minds
were
fully
prepared
for
an
attempt
to
conquer
palestine
when
their
leaders
began
to
preach
the
sacred
duty
of
delivering
the
holy
sepulchre
from
the
hands
of
the
infidels
at
the
council
of
clermont
in
pope
urban
ii
depicted
the
miseries
of
christians
in
palestine
and
with
a
power
of
eloquence
unsurpassed
in
his
day
called
upon
those
who
heard
him
to
wipe
off
from
the
face
of
the
earth
the
impurities
which
caused
them
and
to
lift
their
oppressed
from
the
depths
into
which
they
had
been
trampled
he
urged
them
to
take
up
arms
in
the
service
of
the
cross
at
the
same
time
setting
before
them
the
temporal
no
less
than
the
spiritual
advantages
that
would
accrue
from
the
conquest
of
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
and
which
he
said
should
be
divided
among
them
he
likewise
offered
them
full
pardon
for
all
their
sins
the
enthusiasm
of
his
hearers
burst
all
bounds
and
with
one
voice
they
cried
god
wills
it
god
wills
it
to
all
parts
of
europe
the
fervor
spread
the
pope
was
powerfully
aided
by
an
earnest
and
eloquent
if
ignorant
monk
peter
the
hermit
of
amiens
who
declared
that
he
would
rouse
the
martial
spirit
of
europe
in
the
cause
and
he
himself
was
the
first
with
whatsoever
of
misguided
zeal
to
lead
the
way
to
the
holy
land
the
crusades
are
so
called
from
the
simple
circumstance
that
the
badge
chosen
for
the
movement
was
the
cross
which
pope
urban
bade
the
christian
warriors
wear
on
their
breasts
or
on
their
shoulders
as
the
sign
of
him
who
died
for
the
salvation
of
their
souls
and
as
the
pledge
of
a
vow
that
could
never
be
recalled
in
the
enterprise
to
which
latin
christendom
stood
committed
the
several
nations
or
countries
of
europe
took
equal
parts
or
rather
no
as
such
took
any
part
in
it
at
all
and
in
this
fact
we
have
the
explanation
of
that
want
of
coherent
action
and
even
decent
or
average
generalship
which
is
commonly
seen
in
national
undertakings
for
the
crusade
there
was
no
attempt
at
a
commissariat
no
care
for
a
base
of
supplies
and
the
crusading
hosts
were
a
collection
of
individual
adventurers
who
either
went
without
making
any
provisions
for
their
journey
or
provided
for
their
own
needs
and
those
of
their
followers
from
their
own
resources
the
number
of
these
adventurers
was
naturally
determined
by
the
political
conditions
of
the
country
from
which
they
came
in
italy
the
struggle
between
the
pope
and
the
antipope
went
far
toward
chilling
enthusiasm
and
the
recruits
for
the
crusading
army
came
chiefly
from
the
normans
who
had
followed
robert
guiscard
to
the
sunny
southern
lands
the
spaniards
were
busied
with
a
crusade
nearer
home
and
were
already
pushing
back
to
the
south

mahometan
dominion
which
had
once
threatened
to
pass
the
barriers
of
the
pyrenees
and
carry
the
crescent
to
the
shores
of
the
baltic
sea
about
ten
years
before

dynasty
of

had
been
expelled
by

the

fallen
twenty

and
while

was
hurrying
hither

through
the
countries
of

the
christians
of

were
winning

was
ringing
with

the
summons

was
received
with

had
been
humbled
to

by
their
countrymen
as
an
encouragement
to
follow
their
example
in
england
the
english
were
too
much
weighed
down
by
the
miseries
of
the
conquest
the
normans
too
much
occupied
in
strengthening
their
position
and
the
king
william
the
red
more
ready
to
take
advantage
of
the
needs
of
his
brother
robert
than
to
incur
any
risks
of
his
own
the
great
movement
came
from
the
lands
extending
from
the
scheldt
to
the
pyrenees
franks
and
normans
alike
made
ready
with
impetuous
haste
for
the
great
adventure
and
tens
of
thousands
who
could
not
wait
for
the
formation
of
something
like
a
regular
army
hurried
away
under
leaders
as
frantic
as
themselves
to
their
inevitable
doom
little
more
than
half
the
time
allowed
for
the
gathering
of
the
crusaders
had
passed
away
when
a
crowd
of
some
sixty
thousand
men
and
women
neither
caring
nor
thinking
about
the
means
by
which
their
ends
could
be
attained
insisted
that
the
hermit
peter
should
lead
them
at
once
to
the
holy
city
mere
charity
may
justify
the
belief
that
some
even
among
these
may
have
been
folk
of
decent
lives
moved
by
the
earnest
conviction
that
their
going
to
jerusalem
would
do
some
good
that
the
vast
majority
looked
upon
their
vow
as
a
license
for
the
commission
of
any
sin
there
can
be
no
moral
doubt
that
they
exhibited
not
a
single
quality
needed
for
the
successful
prosecution
of
their
enterprise
is
absolutely
certain
with
a
foolhardiness
equal
to
his
ignorance
peter
undertook
the
task
in
which
he
was
aided
by
walter
the
penniless
a
man
with
some
pretensions
to
the
character
but
the
utter
disorder
of
this
motley
host
made
it
impossible
for
them
to
journey
long
together
at
cologne
they
parted
company
and
fifteen
thousand
under
the
penniless
walter
made
their
way
to
the
frontiers
of
hungary
while
peter
led
onward
a
host
which
swelled
gradually
on
the
march
to
about
forty
thousand
another
army
or
horde
of
perhaps
twenty
thousand
marched
under
the
guidance
of
emico
count
of
leiningen
a
third
under
that
of
the
monk
gottschalk
a
man
not
notorious
for
the
purity
or
disinterestedness
of
his
motives
behind
these
came
a
rabble
it
is
said
of
two
hundred
thousand
men
women
and
children
preceded
by
a
goose
and
a
goat
or
as
some
have
supposed
by
banners
on
which
as
symbols
of
the
mysterious
faith
of
gnostics
and
paulicians
the
likeness
of
these
animals
was
painted
in
this
vile
horde
no
pretence
was
kept
up
of
order
or
of
decency
sinning
freely
it
would
seem
that
grace
might
abound
they
plundered
and
harried
the
lands
through
which
they
marched
while
three
thousand
horsemen
headed
by
some
counts
and
gentlemen
were
not
too
dignified
to
act
as
their
attendants
and
to
share
their
spoil
but
if
they
had
no
scruple
in
robbing
christians
their
delight
was
to
prove
the
reality
of
their
mission
as
soldiers
of
the
cross
by
plundering
torturing
and
slaying
jews
the
crusade
against
the
turk
was
interpreted
as
a
crusade
directed
not
less
explicitly
against
the
descendants
of
those
who
had
crucified
the
redeemer
the
streets
of
verdun
and
treves
and
of
the
great
cities
on
the
rhine
ran
red
with
the
blood
of
their
victims
and
if
some
saved
their
lives
by
pretended
conversions
many
more
cheated
their
persecutors
by
throwing
their
property
and
their
persons
either
into
the
rivers
or
into
the
consuming
fires
a
space
of
six
hundred
miles
lay
between
the
austrian
frontier
and
constantinople
and
across
the
dreary
waste
the
followers
of
walter
the
penniless
struggled
on
destitute
of
money
and
rousing
the
hostility
of
the
inhabitants
whom
they
robbed
and
in
bulgaria
their
misdeeds
provoked
reprisals
which
threatened
their
destruction
and
none
perhaps
would
have
reached
constantinople
if
the
imperial
commander
at
naissos
had
not
rescued
them
from
their
enemies
supplied
them
with
food
and
guarded
them
through
the
remainder
of
their
journey
these
succors
involved
some
costs
and
the
costs
were
paid
by
the
sale
of
unarmed
men
among
the
pilgrims
and
especially
of
the
women
and
children
who
were
seized
to
provide
the
necessary
funds
of
those
who
formed
the
train
of
the
hermit
peter
seven
thousand
only
it
is
said
reached
constantinople
of
such
a
rabble
rout
the
emperor
alexius
needed
not
to
be
afraid
he
had
already
seen
and
encountered
far
larger
armies
of
normans
turks
and
romans
and
he
now
extended
to
this
vanguard
of
the
hosts
of
latin
christendom
a
hospitality
which
was
almost
immediately
abused
they
had
refused
to
comply
with
his
request
that
they
should
quietly
await
the
arrival
of
their
and
consulting
the
safety
of
his
people
not
less
than
his
own
he
induced
them
to
cross
the
bosporus
and
pitch
their
camp
on
asiatic
soil
the
land
which
they
had
come
to
wrest
from
the
unbelievers
footnote
head
of
the
byzantine
empire
alexius
wished
simply
to
be
rid
of
their
presence
they
had
to
deal
with
an
enemy
still
more
crafty
and
formidable
in
the
seljukian
sultan
david
the
vagrants
whom
peter
and
walter
had
brought
thus
far
on
the
road
to
jerusalem
were
scattered
about
the
land
in
search
of
food
and
it
was
no
hard
task
for
david
to
cheat
the
main
body
with
the
false
tidings
that
their
companions
had
carried
the
walls
of
nice
and
were
revelling
in
the
pleasures
and
spoils
of
his
capital
the
doomed
horde
rushed
into
the
plain
which
fronts
the
city
and
a
vast
heap
of
bones
alone
remained
to
tell
the
story
of
the
great
catastrophe
when
the
forces
which
might
more
legitimately
claim
the
name
of
an
army
passed
the
spot
where
the
seljukian
had
entrapped
and
crushed
his
victims
in
this
wild
expedition
not
less
it
is
said
than
three
hundred
thousand
human
beings
had
already
paid
the
penalty
of
their
lives
still
the
first
crusade
was
destined
to
accomplish
more
than
any
of
the
seven
or
eight
crusades
which
followed
it
and
this
measure
of
success
it
achieved
probably
because
none
of
the
great
european
sovereigns
took
part
in
it
the
task
of
setting
up
a
latin
kingdom
in
palestine
was
to
be
achieved
by
princes
of
the
second
order
of
these
the
foremost
and
the
most
deservedly
illustrious
was
godfrey
of
bouillon
in
the
ardennes
a
kinsman
of
the
counts
of
boulogne
and
duke
of
lotharingen
lorraine
in
the
service
of
the
emperor
henry
iv
the
enemy
or
the
victim
of
hildebrand
he
had
been
the
first
to
mount
the
walls
of
rome
and
cleave
his
way
into
the
city
he
might
now
hope
that
his
crusading
vow
would
be
accepted
as
an
atonement
for
his
sacrilege
speaking
the
frank
and
teutonic
dialects
with
equal
ease
he
exercised
by
his
bravery
his
wisdom
and
the
uprightness
of
his
life
an
influence
which
brought
to
his
standard
it
is
said
not
less
than
eighty
thousand
infantry
and
ten
thousand
horsemen
together
with
his
brothers
baldwin
and
eustace
count
of
boulogne
among
the
most
conspicuous
of
godfrey
colleagues
was
hugh
count
of
vermandois
with
him
may
be
placed
the
norman
duke
robert
whose
carelessness
had
lost
him
the
crown
of
england
and
who
had
now
pawned
his
duchy
for
a
pittance
scarcely
less
paltry
than
that
for
which
esau
bartered
away
his
birthright
the
number
of
the
great
chiefs
who
led
the
pilgrims
from
northern
europe
is
completed
with
the
names
of
robert
count
of
flanders
and
of
stephen
count
of
chartres
troyes
and
blois
foremost
by
virtue
of
his
title
and
office
among
the
leaders
of
the
southern
bands
was
the
papal
legate
adhemar
aymer
bishop
of
puy
a
leader
rather
as
guiding
the
counsels
of
the
army
than
as
gathering
soldiers
under
his
banner
a
hundred
thousand
horse
and
foot
attested
we
are
told
the
greatness
the
wealth
and
the
zeal
of
raymond
count
of
toulouse
lord
of
auvergne
and
languedoc
who
had
grown
old
in
warfare
less
tinged
with
the
fanatical
enthusiasm
of
his
comrades
and
certainly
more
cool
and
deliberate
in
his
ambition
bohemond
son
of
robert
guiscard
looked
to
the
crusade
as
a
means
by
which
he
might
regain
the
vast
regions
extending
from
the
dalmatian
coast
to
the
northern
shores
of
the
aegean
nay
if
we
are
to
believe
william
of
malmesbury
he
urged
urban
to
set
forward
the
enterprise
for
the
very
purpose
partly
of
thus
recovering
what
he
was
pleased
to
regard
as
his
inheritance
and
in
part
of
enabling
the
pontiff
to
suppress
all
opposition
in
rome
guiscard
had
left
his
apulian
domains
to
a
younger
son
and
bohemond
was
resolved
it
would
seem
to
add
to
his
principality
of
tarentum
a
kingdom
which
would
make
him
a
formidable
rival
of
the
eastern
emperor
far
above
bohemond
rises
his
cousin
tancred
the
son
of
the
marquis
odo
surnamed
the
good
and
of
emma
the
sister
of
robert
guiscard
in
tancred
was
seen
the
embodiment
of
those
peculiar
sentiments
and
modes
of
thought
which
gave
birth
to
the
crusades
and
to
which
the
crusades
in
their
turn
imparted
marvellous
strength
and
splendor
the
miserable
remnant
of
three
thousand
men
who
escaped
from
the
field
of
blood
before
the
city
of
the
seljukian
sultan
found
a
refuge
in
byzantine
territory
about
the
time
when
the
better
appointed
armies
of
the
crusaders
were
setting
off
on
their
eastward
journey
the
most
disciplined
of
these
troops
set
out
with
a
vast
following
from
the
banks
of
the
meuse
and
the
moselle
under
godfrey
of
bouillon
who
led
them
safely
and
without
opposition
to
the
hungarian
border
here
the
armies
of
hungary
barred
the
way
against
the
advance
of
a
host
at
whose
hands
they
dreaded
a
repetition
of
the
havoc
wrought
by
the
lawless
bands
of
peter
the
hermit
and
his
colleagues
three
weeks
passed
away
in
vain
attempts
to
get
over
the
difficulty
the
hungarian
king
demanded
as
a
hostage
baldwin
the
brother
of
the
general
the
demand
was
refused
and
godfrey
put
him
to
shame
by
surrendering
himself
he
asked
only
for
a
free
passage
and
a
free
market
but
although
these
were
granted
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
prevent
some
disorder
and
some
depredations
as
his
army
or
horde
passed
through
the
country
the
mischief
might
have
been
much
worse
had
not
the
hungarian
cavalry
acting
professedly
as
a
friendly
escort
but
really
as
cautious
warders
kept
close
to
the
crusading
hosts
at
length
they
reached
the
gates
of
philippopolis
and
here
godfrey
learned
that
hugh
of
vermandois
whose
coming
had
been
announced
to
the
greek
emperor
alexius
by
knights
in
golden
armor
and
who
styled
himself
the
brother
of
the
king
of
kings
and
lord
of
all
the
frankish
hosts
was
a
prisoner
within
the
walls
of
constantinople
with
robert
of
normandy
and
robert
of
flanders
with
stephen
of
chartres
and
some
lesser
chiefs
hugh
had
chosen
to
make
his
way
through
italy
and
the
charms
of
that
voluptuous
land
had
a
greater
effect
it
seems
in
breaking
up
and
corrupting
their
forces
than
the
delights
of
capua
had
in
weakening
the
soldiers
of
hannibal
with
little
regard
to
order
the
chiefs
determined
to
cross
the
sea
as
best
they
might
hugh
embarked
at
bari
and
if
we
may
believe
anna
comnena
the
historian
and
the
worshipper
of
her
father
alexius
his
fleet
was
broken
by
a
tempest
which
shattered
his
own
ship
on
the
coast
between
palos
and
dyrrhachium
durazzo
of
which
john
comnenus
the
nephew
of
the
emperor
was
at
this
time
the
governor
the
frank
chief
was
here
detained
until
the
good
pleasure
of
alexius
should
be
known
that
wary
and
cunning
prince
saw
at
once
how
much
might
be
made
of
his
prisoner
who
was
by
his
orders
conducted
with
careful
respect
and
ceremony
to
the
capital
kept
here
really
as
a
hostage
but
welcomed
to
outward
seeming
as
a
friend
hugh
was
so
completely
won
by
the
charm
of
manner
which
alexius
well
knew
how
and
when
to
put
on
that
paying
him
homage
and
declaring
himself
his
man
he
promised
to
do
what
he
could
to
induce
others
to
follow
his
example
from
philippopolis
godfrey
sent
ambassadors
to
alexius
demanding
the
immediate
surrender
of
hugh
the
request
was
refused
and
godfrey
resumed
his
march
treating
the
land
through
which
he
passed
as
an
enemy
country
until
by
way
of
adrianople
he
at
length
appeared
before
the
walls
of
the
capital
at
christmastide
the
fears
of
alexius
were
aroused
by
the
sight
of
a
host
so
vast
and
so
formidable
they
quickened
into
terror
as
he
thought
of
the
armies
which
were
still
on
their
way
under
the
command
of
bohemond
and
tancred
of
godfrey
beyond
the
fact
of
his
mission
as
a
crusader
he
knew
little
or
nothing
but
in
bohemond
he
saw
one
who
claimed
as
his
inheritance
no
small
portion
of
his
empire
this
gathering
of
myriads
whom
a
false
step
on
his
part
might
convert
into
open
enemies
was
the
result
of
his
own
entreaties
urged
through
his
envoys
before
urban
ii
in
the
council
of
piacenza
and
his
mind
was
divided
between
a
feverish
anxiety
to
hurry
them
on
to
their
destination
and
so
to
rid
himself
of
their
hateful
presence
and
the
desire
to
retain
a
hold
not
only
on
the
crusading
chiefs
but
on
any
conquests
which
they
might
make
in
syria
hugh
was
sent
back
to
godfrey
camp
but
the
quarrel
was
patched
up
rather
than
ended
it
was
easier
to
rouse
suspicion
and
jealousy
than
to
restore
friendship
but
it
was
of
the
first
importance
for
alexius
that
he
should
secure
the
homage
of
the
princes
already
gathered
round
his
capital
before
the
arrival
of
his
ancient
enemy
bohemond
in
this
he
succeeded
and
a
compact
was
made
by
which
alexius
pledged
them
his
word
that
he
would
supply
them
with
food
and
aid
them
in
their
eastward
march
and
would
protect
all
pilgrims
passing
through
his
dominions
on
the
other
hand
the
crusading
chiefs
as
already
subjects
of
other
sovereigns
gave
their
fealty
to
the
emperor
as
their
liege
lord
only
for
the
time
during
which
they
might
remain
within
his
borders
and
undertook
to
restore
to
him
such
of
their
conquests
as
had
been
recently
wrested
from
the
empire
the
policy
and
the
bribes
of
alexius
had
overcome
the
opposition
of
bohemond
he
was
to
experience
a
stouter
resistance
from
raymond
of
toulouse
who
though
he
had
been
the
first
to
enlist
was
the
last
to
set
out
on
his
crusade
the
count
of
toulouse
scarcely
regarded
himself
as
the
vassal
even
of
the
french
king
he
was
ready
he
said
to
be
the
friend
of
alexius
on
equal
terms
but
he
would
not
declare
himself
to
be
his
man
on
this
point
he
was
immovable
although
bohemond
tried
the
effect
of
a
threat
which
was
never
forgiven
that
if
the
quarrel
came
to
blows
he
should
be
found
on
the
side
of
the
emperor
but
alexius
soon
saw
that
in
raymond
he
had
to
deal
with
an
enthusiast
as
sincere
and
persistent
as
godfrey
he
took
his
measures
accordingly
winning
the
heart
of
the
old
warrior
although
he
failed
to
compel
his
obedience
while
alexius
was
busied
in
dealing
with
godfrey
and
raymond
bohemond
and
tancred
he
was
not
less
anxiously
occupied
with
the
task
of
sending
across
the
bosporus
the
swarms
which
might
soon
become
an
army
of
devouring
locusts
round
his
own
capital
it
was
easier
to
give
them
a
welcome
than
to
get
rid
of
them
and
more
than
two
months
had
passed
since
christmas
when
the
followers
of
godfrey
found
themselves
on
the
soil
of
asia
godfrey
men
had
no
sooner
been
landed
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
bosporus
than
all
the
vessels
which
had
transported
them
were
brought
back
to
the
western
shore
with
great
astuteness
and
at
the
cost
of
large
gifts
alexius
in
like
manner
freed
the
neighborhood
of
his
capital
from
the
invading
multitudes
as
fast
as
they
came
they
were
hurried
across
and
the
emperor
breathed
more
freely
when
on
the
feast
of
pentecost
not
a
single
latin
pilgrim
remained
on
the
european
shore
the
danger
of
conflict
had
throughout
been
imminent
and
the
danger
arose
not
so
much
from
the
fact
that
the
crusaders
were
armed
men
marching
through
the
country
of
professed
allies
but
from
the
thorough
antagonism
between
greeks
and
latins
in
modes
of
thought
and
habits
of
life
nor
must
we
forget
the
vast
gulf
which
separated
the
eastern
from
the
western
clergy
the
clergy
of
the
west
despised
their
brethren
of
the
east
for
their
cowardly
submission
to
the
secular
arm
these
in
their
turn
shrunk
with
horror
from
the
sight
of
bishops
priests
and
monks
riding
with
weapons
over
fields
of
battle
and
exhibiting
at
other
times
an
ignorance
equal
to
their
ferocity
the
strength
and
valor
of
the
crusaders
were
soon
to
be
tested
they
were
now
face
to
face
with
the
turks
on
whose
cowardice
urban
ii
had
enlarged
with
so
much
complacency
before
the
council
of
clermont
the
sultan
david
or
kilidje
arslan
placed
his
family
and
treasures
in
his
capital
city
of
nice
and
retreated
with
fifty
thousand
horsemen
to
the
mountains
whence
he
swooped
down
from
time
to
time
on
the
outposts
of
the
christians
by
these
his
city
was
formally
invested
and
for
seven
weeks
it
was
assailed
to
little
purpose
by
the
old
instruments
of
roman
warfare
while
some
of
the
besiegers
shot
their
weapons
from
the
hill
on
which
were
mouldering
the
bones
of
the
fanatic
followers
of
peter
it
was
protected
to
the
west
by
the
askanian
lake
and
so
long
as
the
turks
had
command
of
this
lake
they
felt
themselves
safe
but
alexius
sent
thither
on
sledges
a
large
number
of
boats
and
the
city
subjected
to
a
double
blockade
submitted
to
the
emperor
who
was
in
no
way
anxious
to
see
the
crusaders
masters
of
the
place
the
crusaders
were
making
ready
for
the
last
assault
when
they
saw
the
imperial
banner
floating
on
the
walls
their
disappointment
at
the
escape
of
the
miscreants
or
unbelievers
for
so
they
delighted
to
speak
of
them
was
vented
in
threats
which
seemed
to
bode
a
renewal
of
the
old
troubles
but
alexius
with
gifts
which
added
force
to
his
words
professed
that
his
only
desire
now
as
it
had
been
was
to
forward
them
safely
on
their
journey
nor
had
they
to
go
many
stages
before
they
found
themselves
again
confronted
with
their
adversary
the
conflict
took
place
near
the
phrygian
dorylaion
and
seemed
at
first
to
portend
dire
defeat
to
the
crusaders
more
than
once
the
issue
of
the
day
seemed
to
be
turned
by
the
indomitable
personal
bravery
of
the
norman
robert
of
tancred
and
of
bohemond
and
when
even
those
seemed
likely
to
be
borne
down
they
received
timely
succors
from
godfrey
and
hugh
of
vermandois
from
bishop
adhemar
of
puy
and
from
raymond
count
of
toulouse
still
the
turks
held
out
and
it
seemed
likely
that
they
would
long
hold
out
when
the
appearance
of
the
last
division
of
raymond
army
filled
them
with
the
fear
that
a
new
host
was
upon
them
the
crusaders
had
won
a
considerable
victory
three
thousand
knights
belonging
to
the
enemy
had
been
slain
and
kilidje
arslan
was
hurrying
away
to
enlist
the
services
of
his
kinsmen
meanwhile
the
latin
hosts
were
sweeping
onward
hundreds
died
from
the
heat
and
dogs
or
goats
took
the
place
of
the
which
had
perished
at
length
tancred
with
his
troop
found
himself
before
tarsus
the
birthplace
and
the
home
of
that
apostle
who
long
ago
had
preached
a
gospel
strangely
unlike
the
creed
of
the
crusaders
following
rapidly
behind
him
baldwin
saw
with
keen
jealousy
the
banner
of
the
italian
chief
floating
on
its
towers
and
insisted
on
taking
the
precedence
tancred
pleaded
the
choice
of
the
people
and
his
own
promise
to
protect
them
but
the
intrigues
of
baldwin
changed
their
humor
and
the
rejection
of
tancred
by
the
men
of
tarsus
was
followed
by
an
attempt
at
private
war
between
tancred
and
baldwin
in
which
the
troops
of
tancred
were
overborne
so
early
was
the
first
harvest
of
murderous
discord
reaped
among
the
holy
warriors
of
the
cross
it
was
ruin
however
to
stay
where
they
were
and
the
main
army
again
began
its
march
to
undergo
once
more
the
old
monotony
of
hardship
and
peril
a
very
small
force
would
have
sufficed
to
disorganize
and
rout
them
as
they
clambered
over
the
defiles
of
mount
taurus
nor
could
raymond
recovering
from
a
terrible
illness
or
godfrey
suffering
from
wounds
inflicted
by
a
bear
have
done
much
to
help
them
but
for
the
present
their
enemies
were
dismayed
and
baldwin
brother
of
godfrey
hastened
with
eagerness
to
obey
a
summons
which
besought
him
to
aid
the
greek
or
armenian
tyrant
of
edessa
as
alexius
had
done
to
his
brother
so
this
chief
welcomed
baldwin
as
his
son
but
baldwin
having
once
entered
into
the
city
cared
nothing
for
the
means
which
had
brought
him
thither
and
the
death
of
his
adoptive
father
was
followed
by
the
establishment
at
edessa
of
a
latin
principality
which
lasted
for
or
as
some
have
thought
years
baldwin
had
anticipated
the
unconditional
surrender
of
samosata
but
the
turkish
governor
had
some
of
the
edessenes
in
his
power
and
he
refused
to
give
up
the
city
except
on
the
payment
of
ten
thousand
gold
pieces
the
turk
shortly
afterward
fell
into
baldwin
hands
and
was
put
to
death
meanwhile
the
main
army
of
the
crusaders
was
advancing
toward
the
syrian
capital
antioch
that
ancient
and
luxurious
city
whose
fame
had
gone
over
the
whole
roman
world
for
its
magnificence
its
unbounded
wealth
its
soft
delights
and
its
unholy
pleasures
the
days
of
its
greatest
splendor
had
passed
away
its
walls
were
partially
in
ruins
its
buildings
were
in
some
parts
crumbling
away
or
had
already
fallen
but
against
assailants
utterly
ignorant
and
awkward
in
all
that
relates
to
the
blockade
of
cities
it
was
still
a
formidable
position
nor
could
they
invest
it
until
they
had
passed
the
iron
bridge
so
called
from
its
gates
of
nine
stone
arches
which
spanned
the
stream
of
the
ifrin
at
a
distance
of
nine
miles
from
the
city
this
bridge
was
carried
by
the
impetuous
charge
of
robert
of
normandy
aided
by
the
more
steady
efforts
of
godfrey
and
in
the
language
of
an
age
which
delighted
in
round
numbers
a
hundred
thousand
warriors
hurried
across
to
seize
the
splendid
prize
which
now
seemed
almost
within
their
grasp
but
the
city
was
in
the
hands
of
men
who
had
been
long
accustomed
to
despise
the
greeks
and
who
had
not
yet
learned
to
respect
the
valor
of
the
latins
preparing
himself
for
a
resolute
defence
the
seljukian
governor
baghasian
had
sent
away
as
useless
if
not
mischievous
most
of
the
christians
within
the
town
and
the
crusading
chiefs
had
begun
to
discuss
the
prudence
of
postponing
all
operations
till
the
spring
when
raymond
of
toulouse
with
some
other
chiefs
insisted
that
delay
would
imply
fear
and
that
the
imputation
of
cowardice
would
insure
the
paralysis
of
their
enterprise
the
city
was
therefore
at
once
invested
so
far
as
the
forces
of
the
crusaders
could
suffice
to
encircle
it
and
a
siege
began
which
in
the
eyes
of
the
military
historian
must
be
absolutely
without
interest
and
of
which
the
issue
was
decided
by
paroxysms
of
fanatical
vehemence
on
the
one
side
and
by
lack
not
of
bravery
but
of
generalship
on
the
other
of
the
eastern
and
northern
walls
the
blockade
was
complete
of
the
west
it
was
partial
and
the
failure
to
invest
a
portion
of
the
western
wall
with
two
out
of
the
five
gates
of
the
city
left
the
movements
of
the
turks
in
this
direction
free
but
the
besiegers
were
in
no
hurry
to
begin
the
work
of
death
the
wealth
of
the
harvest
and
the
vintage
spread
before
them
its
irresistible
temptations
and
the
herds
feeding
in
the
rich
pastures
seemed
to
promise
an
endless
feast
the
cattle
the
corn
and
the
wine
were
alike
wasted
with
besotted
folly
while
the
turks
within
the
walls
received
tidings
it
is
said
of
all
that
passed
in
the
crusading
camp
from
some
greek
and
armenian
christians
to
whom
they
allowed
free
egress
and
ingress
of
this
knowledge
they
availed
themselves
in
planning
the
sallies
by
which
they
caused
great
distress
to
the
besiegers
whose
clumsy
engines
and
devices
seemed
to
produce
no
result
beyond
the
waste
of
time
and
who
felt
perhaps
that
they
had
done
something
when
they
blocked
up
the
gate
of
the
bridge
with
huge
stones
dug
from
the
neighboring
quarries
three
months
passed
away
and
the
crusaders
found
themselves
not
conquerors
but
in
desperate
straits
from
famine
the
winter
rains
had
turned
the
land
round
their
camp
into
a
swamp
and
lack
of
food
left
them
more
and
more
unable
to
resist
the
pestilential
diseases
which
were
rapidly
thinning
their
numbers
a
foraging
expedition
under
bohemond
and
tancred
filled
the
camp
with
food
it
was
again
recklessly
wasted
the
second
famine
scared
away
tatikios
the
lieutenant
of
the
greek
emperor
alexius
but
the
crusading
chiefs
were
perhaps
still
more
disgusted
by
the
desertion
of
william
of
melun
called
the
carpenter
from
the
sledgehammer
blows
which
he
dealt
out
in
battle
hunger
obtained
a
victory
even
over
the
hermit
peter
who
was
stealing
away
with
william
of
melun
when
he
with
his
companion
was
caught
by
tancred
and
brought
back
to
the
tent
of
bohemond
for
a
moment
the
look
of
things
was
changed
by
the
arrival
of
ambassadors
from
egypt
to
the
fatimite
caliph
of
that
country
the
progress
of
the
crusading
arms
had
thus
far
brought
with
it
but
little
dissatisfaction
the
humiliation
of
the
seljukian
turks
could
not
fail
to
bring
gain
to
himself
if
the
flood
of
latin
conquests
could
be
checked
and
turned
back
in
time
his
generals
besieged
jerusalem
and
tyre
and
when
the
fatimite
once
more
ruled
in
palestine
his
envoys
hastened
to
the
crusaders
camp
to
announce
the
deliverance
of
the
holy
land
from
its
oppressors
to
assure
to
all
unarmed
and
peaceable
pilgrims
a
month
unmolested
sojourn
in
jerusalem
and
to
promise
them
his
aid
during
their
march
on
condition
that
they
should
acknowledge
his
supremacy
within
the
limits
of
his
syrian
empire
the
arguments
and
threats
of
the
caliph
were
alike
thrown
away
the
latin
chiefs
disclaimed
all
interest
in
the
feuds
and
quarrels
of
rival
sultans
and
in
the
fortunes
of
mahometan
sects
god
himself
had
destined
jerusalem
for
the
christians
and
if
any
held
it
who
were
not
christians
these
were
usurpers
whose
resistance
must
be
punished
by
their
expulsion
or
their
death
the
envoys
departed
not
encouraged
by
this
answer
and
still
more
perplexed
by
the
appearance
of
plenty
and
by
the
magnificence
of
a
camp
in
which
they
had
expected
to
see
a
terrible
spectacle
of
disorder
and
misery
the
resolute
persistence
of
the
besiegers
convinced
baghasian
of
the
need
of
reinforcements
these
were
hastening
to
him
from
caesarea
aleppo
and
other
places
when
they
were
cut
off
by
bohemond
and
raymond
who
sent
a
multitude
of
heads
to
the
envoys
of
the
fatimite
caliph
and
discharged
many
hundreds
from
their
engines
into
the
city
of
antioch
the
turks
had
their
opportunity
for
reprisals
when
the
arrival
of
some
pisan
and
genoese
ships
at
the
mouth
of
the
orontes
drew
off
the
greater
part
of
the
besieging
army
the
crusaders
were
returning
with
provisions
and
arms
when
their
enemies
started
upon
them
from
an
ambuscade
the
battle
was
fierce
but
the
defeat
of
raymond
which
threatened
dire
disaster
was
changed
into
victory
on
the
arrival
of
godfrey
and
the
norman
robert
whose
exploits
equalled
or
surpassed
if
we
are
to
believe
the
story
even
those
of
arthur
lancelot
or
tristram
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
turks
fell
their
bodies
were
buried
by
their
comrades
in
the
cemetery
without
the
walls
the
christians
dug
them
up
severed
the
heads
from
the
trunks
and
paraded
the
ghastly
trophies
on
their
pikes
not
forgetting
to
send
a
goodly
number
to
the
egyptian
caliph
by
way
of
showing
how
his
seljukian
friends
or
enemies
had
fared
the
picture
is
disgusting
but
if
we
shut
our
eyes
to
these
loathsome
details
the
truth
of
the
history
is
gone
we
are
dealing
with
the
wars
of
savages
and
it
is
right
that
we
should
know
this
the
next
scene
exhibits
godfrey
and
bohemond
in
fierce
quarrel
about
a
splendid
tent
which
being
intended
as
a
gift
for
the
former
had
been
seized
by
an
armenian
chief
and
sent
to
the
latter
but
there
was
now
more
serious
business
on
hand
rumor
spoke
of
the
near
approach
of
a
persian
army
and
the
besieged
under
the
plea
of
wishing
to
arrange
terms
of
capitulation
obtained
a
truce
which
they
sought
probably
only
for
the
sake
of
gaining
time
the
days
passed
by
but
no
offers
were
made
and
their
disposition
was
shown
by
seizing
a
crusading
knight
in
the
groves
near
the
city
and
tearing
his
body
in
pieces
the
latins
returned
with
increased
fury
to
the
siege
but
the
defence
although
more
feeble
was
still
protracted
and
bohemond
began
to
feel
not
only
that
fraud
might
succeed
where
force
had
failed
but
that
from
fraud
he
might
reap
not
safety
merely
but
wealth
and
greatness
his
plans
were
laid
with
a
renegade
christian
named
phirouz
high
in
the
favor
of
the
governor
with
whom
he
had
come
into
contact
either
during
the
truce
or
in
some
other
way
by
splendid
promises
he
insured
the
zealous
aid
of
his
new
ally
and
then
came
forward
in
the
council
with
the
assurance
that
he
could
place
the
city
in
their
hands
but
that
he
could
do
this
only
on
condition
that
he
should
rule
in
antioch
as
baldwin
ruled
in
edessa
his
claim
was
angrily
opposed
by
the
provençal
raymond
but
this
opposition
was
overruled
and
it
was
resolved
that
the
plan
should
be
carried
out
at
once
there
was
need
for
so
doing
rumors
spread
within
the
city
that
some
attempt
was
to
be
made
to
betray
the
place
to
the
besiegers
and
hints
or
open
accusations
pointed
out
phirouz
as
the
traitor
like
other
traitors
the
renegade
thought
it
best
to
anticipate
the
charge
by
urging
that
the
guards
of
the
towers
should
on
the
very
next
day
be
changed
his
proposal
was
received
as
indubitable
proof
of
his
innocence
and
his
faithfulness
but
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
antioch
should
fall
that
night
and
that
night
by
means
of
a
rope
ladder
bohemond
with
about
sixty
followers
the
ropes
broke
before
more
could
ascend
climbed
up
the
wall
seizing
ten
towers
of
which
all
the
guards
were
killed
they
opened
a
gate
and
the
christian
host
rushed
in
the
banner
of
bohemond
rose
on
one
of
the
towers
the
trumpets
sounded
for
the
onset
and
a
carnage
began
in
which
at
first
the
assailants
took
no
heed
to
distinguish
between
the
christian
and
the
turk
in
the
awful
confusion
of
the
moment
some
of
the
besieged
made
their
way
to
the
citadel
and
there
shut
themselves
in
ready
to
resist
to
the
death
of
the
rest
few
escaped
ten
thousand
it
is
said
were
massacred
baghasian
with
some
friends
passed
out
beyond
the
besiegers
lines
but
fainting
from
loss
of
blood
he
fell
from
his
horse
and
his
companions
hurried
on
a
syrian
christian
heard
his
groans
and
striking
off
his
head
carried
the
prize
to
the
camp
of
the
conquerors
phirouz
lived
to
be
a
second
time
a
renegade
and
to
close
his
career
as
a
thief
the
victory
was
for
the
crusaders
a
change
from
famine
to
abundance
and
their
feasting
was
accompanied
by
the
wildest
riot
and
the
most
filthy
debauchery
but
if
heedless
waste
may
have
been
one
of
the
most
venial
of
their
sins
it
was
the
greatest
of
their
blunders
the
reports
which
spoke
of
the
approach
of
the
persians
were
not
false
the
turks
within
the
citadel
suddenly
found
that
they
were
rather
besiegers
than
besieged
and
that
the
christians
were
hemmed
in
by
the
myriads
of
kerboga
prince
of
mosul
and
the
warriors
of
kilidje
arslan
the
old
horrors
of
famine
were
now
repeated
but
in
greater
intensity
and
the
doom
of
the
latin
host
seemed
now
to
be
sealed
stephen
count
of
chartres
had
deserted
his
companions
before
the
fall
of
the
city
others
now
followed
his
example
and
with
him
set
out
on
their
return
to
europe
in
phrygia
stephen
encountered
the
emperor
alexius
who
was
marching
to
the
aid
of
the
crusaders
not
only
with
a
greek
army
but
with
a
force
of
pilgrims
who
had
reached
constantinople
after
the
departure
of
godfrey
and
his
fellows
the
story
told
by
stephen
drove
out
of
his
head
every
thought
except
that
of
his
own
safety
the
order
for
retreat
was
given
and
the
pilgrim
warriors
not
less
than
the
greeks
were
compelled
to
turn
their
faces
westward
in
antioch
the
crusading
soldiers
were
fast
sinking
into
utter
despair
discipline
had
come
to
an
end
and
so
obstinate
was
their
refusal
to
bear
arms
any
longer
that
bohemond
resolved
to
burn
them
out
of
their
quarters
these
were
consumed
by
the
flames
which
spread
so
rapidly
as
to
fill
him
with
fear
that
he
had
destroyed
not
only
their
dwellings
but
his
whole
principality
his
experiment
brought
the
men
back
to
their
duty
but
so
despondingly
was
their
work
done
that
but
for
some
signal
succor
the
end
it
was
manifest
must
soon
come
in
a
credulous
age
such
succor
at
the
darkest
hour
if
obtained
at
all
will
generally
be
obtained
through
miracle
a
lombard
priest
came
forward
to
whom
ambrose
of
milan
had
declared
in
a
vision
that
the
third
year
of
the
crusade
should
see
the
conquest
of
jerusalem
another
had
seen
the
saviour
himself
attended
by
his
virgin
mother
and
the
prince
of
the
apostles
had
heard
from
his
lips
a
stern
rebuke
of
the
crusaders
for
yielding
to
the
seductions
of
pagan
women
as
if
the
profession
of
christianity
altered
the
color
and
the
guilt
of
a
vice
and
lastly
had
received
the
distinct
assurance
that
in
five
days
they
should
have
the
help
which
they
needed
the
hopes
of
the
crusaders
were
roused
with
hope
came
a
return
of
vigorous
energy
and
peter
barthelemy
chaplain
to
raymond
of
toulouse
seized
the
opportunity
for
recounting
a
vision
which
was
to
be
something
more
than
a
dream
to
him
andrew
had
revealed
the
fact
that
in
the
church
of
peter
lay
hidden
the
steel
head
of
the
spear
which
had
pierced
the
side
of
the
redeemer
as
he
hung
upon
the
cross
and
that
holy
lance
should
win
them
victory
over
all
their
enemies
as
surely
as
the
spear
which
imparted
irresistible
power
to
the
knight
of
the
sangreal
after
two
days
of
special
devotion
they
were
to
search
for
the
weapon
on
the
third
day
the
workmen
began
to
dig
but
until
the
sun
had
set
they
toiled
in
vain
the
darkness
of
night
made
it
easier
for
the
chaplain
to
play
the
part
which
sir
walter
scott
in
the
assigns
to
herman
dousterswivel
in
the
ruins
of
ruth
barefooted
and
with
a
single
garment
the
priest
went
down
into
the
pit
for
a
time
the
strokes
of
his
spade
were
heard
and
then
the
sacred
relic
was
found
carefully
wrapped
in
a
veil
of
silk
and
gold
the
priest
proclaimed
his
discovery
the
people
rushed
into
the
church
and
from
the
church
throughout
the
city
spread
the
flame
of
a
fierce
enthusiasm
nine
or
ten
months
later
peter
barthelemy
paid
the
penalty
of
his
life
for
his
fraud
or
his
superstition
a
bribe
taken
by
his
master
raymond
brought
that
chief
into
ill
odor
with
his
comrades
and
let
loose
against
his
chaplain
the
tongue
of
arnold
the
chaplain
of
bohemond
raymond
had
traded
on
fresh
visions
of
his
clerk
and
arnold
boldly
attacked
him
in
his
citadel
by
denying
the
genuineness
of
the
holy
lance
peter
appealed
to
the
ordeal
of
fire
he
passed
through
the
flames
as
it
seemed
unhurt
the
bystanders
pressed
to
feel
his
flesh
and
were
vehement
in
their
rejoicings
at
the
result
which
vindicated
his
integrity
he
had
really
received
fatal
injuries
twelve
days
afterward
he
died
and
raymond
suffered
greatly
in
his
dignity
and
his
influence
the
infidel
was
doomed
but
the
crusaders
resolved
to
give
him
one
chance
of
escape
peter
the
hermit
was
sent
as
their
envoy
to
kerboga
to
offer
the
alternative
of
departure
from
a
land
which
peter
had
bestowed
on
the
faithful
or
of
baptism
which
should
leave
him
master
of
the
city
and
territory
of
antioch
the
reply
was
short
and
decisive
the
turk
would
not
embrace
an
idolatry
which
he
hated
and
despised
nor
would
he
give
up
soil
which
belonged
to
him
by
right
of
conquest
the
report
of
the
hermit
raised
the
spirit
of
the
crusaders
to
fever
heat
and
on
the
feast
of
peter
and
paul
they
marched
out
in
twelve
divisions
in
remembrance
of
the
mission
of
the
twelve
apostles
while
raymond
of
toulouse
remained
to
prevent
the
escape
of
the
turks
shut
up
in
the
citadel
the
holy
lance
was
borne
by
the
papal
legate
adhemar
bishop
of
puy
and
the
morning
air
laden
with
the
perfume
of
roses
was
now
regarded
as
a
sign
assuring
them
of
the
divine
favor
they
were
prepared
to
see
good
omens
in
everything
and
they
went
in
full
confidence
that
departed
saints
would
as
they
had
been
told
take
part
in
the
battle
and
smite
down
the
infidel
the
fight
one
of
brute
force
on
the
christian
side
of
some
little
skill
as
well
as
strength
on
the
other
had
gone
on
for
some
time
when
such
help
seemed
to
become
needful
tancred
had
hurried
to
the
aid
of
bohemond
who
was
grievously
pressed
by
kilidje
arslan
and
kerboga
was
bearing
heavily
on
godfrey
and
hugh
of
vermandois
when
clothed
in
white
armor
and
riding
on
white
horses
some
human
forms
were
seen
on
the
neighboring
heights
the
saints
are
coming
to
your
aid
shouted
the
bishop
of
puy
and
the
people
saw
in
these
radiant
strangers
the
martyrs
george
maurice
and
theodore
without
awaiting
their
nearer
approach
the
crusaders
turned
on
the
enemy
with
a
force
and
fury
which
were
now
irresistible
their
cavalry
could
do
little
two
hundred
horses
only
remained
of
the
sixty
thousand
which
had
filled
the
plain
a
few
months
before
but
the
hedge
of
spears
advanced
like
a
wall
of
iron
and
the
turks
gave
way
broke
and
fled
it
was
rout
not
retreat
and
with
the
crusaders
victory
was
followed
by
the
massacre
of
men
women
and
children
the
garrison
in
the
citadel
at
once
surrendered
some
declared
themselves
christians
and
were
baptized
those
who
refused
to
abandon
islam
were
taken
to
the
nearest
mohametan
territory
the
city
was
the
prize
of
bohemond
and
in
his
keeping
it
remained
although
raymond
of
toulouse
had
made
an
effort
to
seize
it
by
hoisting
his
banner
on
the
walls
the
work
of
pillage
being
ended
the
churches
were
cleansed
and
repaired
and
their
altars
blazed
with
golden
spoils
taken
from
the
infidel
the
greek
patriarch
was
again
seated
on
his
throne
but
he
held
his
office
at
the
good
pleasure
of
the
latins
and
two
years
later
he
was
made
to
give
place
to
bernard
a
chaplain
of
the
bishop
of
puy
ten
months
had
passed
away
after
the
conquest
of
antioch
when
the
main
body
of
the
crusading
army
set
out
on
its
march
to
jerusalem
they
had
wished
to
depart
at
once
but
their
chiefs
dreaded
to
encounter
waterless
wastes
at
the
end
of
a
syrian
summer
and
for
the
present
they
were
content
to
send
hugh
of
vermandois
and
baldwin
of
hainault
as
envoys
to
the
greek
emperor
to
reproach
him
with
his
remissness
or
his
want
of
faith
but
the
miseries
endured
by
christians
and
turks
were
the
pleasantest
tidings
in
the
ears
of
alexius
for
in
the
weakening
of
both
lay
his
own
strength
and
he
saw
with
satisfaction
the
departure
of
hugh
not
for
antioch
but
for
europe
whither
stephen
of
chartres
had
preceded
him
winter
came
but
the
chiefs
still
lingered
at
antioch
some
were
occupied
in
expeditions
against
neighboring
cities
but
a
more
pressing
care
was
the
plague
which
punished
the
foulness
and
disorder
of
the
pilgrims
a
band
of
fifteen
hundred
germans
recently
landed
in
strong
health
and
full
equipments
were
all
it
is
said
cut
off
and
among
the
victims
the
most
lamented
perhaps
was
the
papal
legate
adhemar
a
feeling
of
discouragement
was
again
spreading
through
the
army
generally
the
chiefs
vainly
entreated
the
pope
to
visit
the
city
where
the
disciples
of
peter
first
received
the
christian
name
the
people
were
disheartened
by
the
animosities
and
the
selfish
or
crooked
policy
of
their
chiefs
raymond
still
hankered
after
the
principality
of
antioch
and
insisted
that
bohemond
and
his
people
should
share
in
the
last
great
enterprise
of
the
crusade
more
disgraceful
than
these
feuds
were
the
scenes
witnessed
during
the
siege
and
after
the
conquest
of
marra
heedlessness
and
waste
soon
brought
the
assailants
to
devour
the
flesh
of
dogs
and
of
human
beings
the
bodies
of
turks
were
torn
from
their
sepulchres
ripped
up
for
the
gold
which
they
were
supposed
to
have
swallowed
and
the
fragments
cooked
and
eaten
of
the
besieged
many
slew
themselves
to
avoid
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
christians
to
some
bohemond
tempted
by
a
large
bribe
gave
an
assurance
of
safety
when
the
massacre
had
begun
he
ordered
these
to
be
brought
forward
the
weak
and
old
he
slaughtered
the
rest
he
sent
to
the
slave
markets
of
antioch
a
weak
attempt
made
by
alexius
to
detain
the
crusaders
only
spurred
them
to
more
vigorous
efforts
they
had
already
left
antioch
and
laodicea
was
in
their
hands
when
he
desired
them
to
await
his
coming
in
june
the
chiefs
remembering
the
departure
of
tatikios
with
his
byzantine
troops
for
cyprus
retorted
that
he
had
broken
his
compact
and
had
therefore
no
further
claims
on
their
obedience
hastening
on
their
way
they
crossed
the
plain
of
berytos
beyrout
overlooked
by
the
eternal
snows
of
lebanon
along
the
narrow
strip
of
land
whence
the
great
phoenician
cities
had
sent
their
seamen
and
their
colonists
with
all
the
wealth
of
the
east
to
the
shores
of
the
adriatic
and
the
gates
of
the
mediterranean
having
reached
jaffa
they
turned
inland
to
ramlah
a
town
sixteen
miles
only
from
jerusalem
two
days
later
the
crusaders
came
in
sight
of
the
holy
city
the
object
of
their
long
pilgrimage
the
cause
of
wretchedness
and
death
to
millions
as
their
eyes
rested
on
the
scene
hallowed
to
them
through
all
the
associations
of
their
faith
the
crusaders
passed
in
an
instant
from
fierce
enthusiasm
to
a
humiliation
which
showed
itself
in
sighs
and
tears
all
fell
on
their
knees
to
kiss
the
sacred
earth
and
to
pour
forth
thanksgivings
that
they
had
been
suffered
to
look
upon
the
desire
of
their
eyes
putting
aside
their
armor
and
their
weapons
they
advanced
in
pilgrim
garb
and
with
bare
feet
toward
the
spot
which
the
saviour
had
trodden
in
the
hours
of
his
agony
and
his
passion
but
before
their
feelings
of
devotion
could
be
indulged
there
was
other
work
to
be
done
the
chiefs
took
up
their
posts
on
those
sides
from
which
the
nature
of
the
ground
gave
most
hope
of
a
successful
assault
on
the
northern
side
were
godfrey
and
tancred
robert
of
flanders
and
robert
of
normandy
on
the
west
raymond
with
his
provençals
on
the
fifth
day
without
siege
instruments
with
only
one
ladder
and
trusting
to
mere
weight
the
crusaders
made
a
desperate
assault
upon
the
walls
some
succeeded
in
reaching
the
summit
and
the
very
rashness
of
their
attack
struck
terror
for
a
moment
into
their
enemies
but
the
garrison
soon
rallied
and
the
invaders
were
all
driven
back
or
hurled
from
the
ramparts
the
task
it
was
manifest
must
be
undertaken
in
a
more
formal
manner
siege
engines
must
be
made
and
the
palm
and
olive
of
the
immediate
neighborhood
would
not
supply
fit
materials
for
their
construction
these
were
obtained
from
the
woods
of
shechem
a
distance
of
thirty
miles
and
the
work
of
preparation
was
carried
on
under
the
guidance
of
gaston
of
beam
by
the
crews
of
some
genoese
vessels
which
had
recently
anchored
at
jaffa
so
passed
away
more
than
thirty
days
days
of
intense
suffering
to
the
besiegers
at
antioch
they
had
been
distressed
chiefly
by
famine
in
place
of
this
wretchedness
they
had
here
the
greater
miseries
of
thirst
the
enemy
had
carefully
destroyed
every
place
which
might
serve
as
a
receptacle
of
water
and
in
seeking
for
it
over
miles
of
desolate
country
they
were
exposed
to
the
harassing
attacks
of
moslem
horsemen
nor
had
visions
and
miracles
improved
the
morals
or
discipline
of
the
camp
and
the
ghost
of
adhemar
of
puy
appeared
to
rebuke
the
horrible
sins
which
were
drawing
down
upon
them
the
judgments
of
the
almighty
better
service
was
done
by
the
generosity
of
tancred
who
made
up
his
quarrel
with
raymond
and
the
enthusiasm
of
the
crusaders
was
again
roused
by
the
preaching
of
arnold
and
the
hermit
peter
the
narrative
of
the
siege
of
jericho
in
the
book
of
joshua
suggested
probably
the
procession
in
which
the
clergy
singing
hymns
preceded
the
laity
round
the
walls
of
the
city
the
saracens
on
the
ramparts
mocked
their
devotions
by
throwing
dirt
upon
crucifixes
but
they
paid
a
terrible
price
for
these
insults
on
the
next
day
the
final
assault
began
and
was
carried
on
through
the
day
with
the
same
monotony
of
brute
force
and
carnage
which
marked
all
the
operations
of
this
merciless
war
the
darkness
of
night
brought
no
rest
the
actual
combat
was
suspended
but
the
besieged
were
incessantly
occupied
in
repairing
the
breaches
made
by
the
assailants
while
these
were
busied
in
making
their
dispositions
for
the
last
mortal
conflict
in
the
midst
of
that
deadly
struggle
when
it
seemed
that
the
cross
must
after
all
go
down
before
the
crescent
a
knight
was
seen
on
mount
olivet
waving
his
glistening
shield
to
rouse
the
champions
of
the
holy
sepulchre
to
the
supreme
effort
it
is
george
the
martyr
who
has
come
again
to
help
us
cried
godfrey
and
at
his
words
the
crusaders
started
up
without
a
feeling
of
fatigue
and
carried
everything
before
them
the
day
we
are
told
was
friday
the
hour
was
three
in
the
afternoon
the
moment
at
which
the
last
cry
from
the
cross
announced
the
accomplishment
of
the
saviour
passion
when
letold
of
tournay
stood
the
first
victorious
champion
of
the
cross
on
the
walls
of
jerusalem
next
to
him
came
we
are
told
his
brother
engelbert
the
third
was
godfrey
tancred
with
the
two
roberts
stormed
the
gate
of
stephen
the
provençals
climbed
the
ramparts
by
ladders
and
the
conquest
of
jerusalem
was
achieved
the
insults
offered
a
little
while
ago
to
the
crucifixes
were
avenged
by
godfrey
orders
in
the
massacre
of
hundreds
the
carnage
in
the
mosque
of
omar
swept
away
the
bodies
of
thousands
in
a
deluge
of
human
blood
the
jews
were
all
burnt
alive
in
their
synagogues
the
horses
of
the
crusaders
who
rode
up
to
the
porch
of
the
temple
were
so
the
story
goes
up
to
the
knees
in
the
loathsome
stream
and
the
forms
of
christian
knights
hacking
and
hewing
the
bodies
of
the
living
and
the
dead
furnished
a
pleasant
commentary
on
the
sermon
of
urban
at
clermont
from
the
duties
of
slaughter
these
disciples
of
the
lamb
of
god
passed
to
those
of
devotion
bareheaded
and
barefooted
clad
in
a
robe
of
pure
white
linen
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
and
thankfulness
mingled
with
profound
contrition
godfrey
entered
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
and
knelt
at
the
tomb
of
his
lord
with
groans
and
tears
his
followers
came
each
in
his
turn
to
offer
his
praises
for
the
divine
mercy
which
had
vouchsafed
this
triumph
to
the
armies
of
christendom
with
feverish
earnestness
they
poured
forth
the
vows
which
bound
them
to
sin
no
more
and
the
excitement
of
prayer
and
slaughter
perhaps
of
both
combined
led
them
to
see
everything
which
might
be
needed
to
give
effect
to
the
closing
scene
of
this
appalling
tragedy
as
the
saints
had
arisen
from
their
graves
when
the
son
of
man
gave
up
the
ghost
on
calvary
so
the
spirits
of
the
pilgrims
who
had
died
on
the
terrible
journey
came
to
take
part
in
the
great
thanksgiving
foremost
among
them
was
adhemar
of
puy
rejoicing
in
the
prayers
for
forgiveness
and
the
resolutions
of
repentance
which
promised
a
new
era
of
peace
upon
earth
and
of
toward
all
men
with
departed
saints
were
mingled
living
men
who
deserved
all
the
honor
which
might
be
paid
to
them
the
backsliding
of
the
hermit
peter
was
blotted
out
of
the
memory
of
those
who
remembered
only
the
fiery
eloquence
which
had
first
called
them
to
their
now
triumphant
pilgrimage
and
the
zeal
which
had
stirred
the
heart
of
christendom
to
cut
short
the
tyranny
of
the
unbeliever
in
the
birthland
of
christianity
the
assembled
throng
fell
down
at
his
feet
and
gave
thanks
to
god
who
had
vouchsafed
to
them
such
a
teacher
his
task
was
done
and
in
the
annals
of
the
time
peter
is
heard
of
no
more
on
this
dreadful
day
tancred
had
spared
three
hundred
captives
to
whom
he
had
given
a
standard
as
a
pledge
of
his
protection
and
a
guarantee
of
their
safety
such
misplaced
mercy
was
a
crime
in
the
eyes
of
the
crusaders
the
massacre
of
the
first
day
may
have
been
aggravated
by
the
ungovernable
excitement
of
victory
but
it
was
resolved
that
on
the
next
day
there
should
be
offered
up
a
more
solemn
and
deliberate
sacrifice
the
men
whom
tancred
had
spared
were
all
murdered
and
the
wrath
of
tancred
was
roused
not
by
their
fate
but
by
an
act
which
called
his
honor
into
question
the
butchery
went
on
with
impartial
completeness
old
and
young
decrepit
men
and
women
mothers
with
their
infants
boys
and
girls
young
men
and
maidens
in
the
bloom
of
their
vigor
all
were
mowed
down
and
their
bodies
mangled
until
heads
and
limbs
were
tossed
together
in
awful
chaos
a
few
were
hidden
away
by
raymond
of
toulouse
his
motive
however
was
not
mercy
but
the
prospects
of
gain
in
the
slave
market
after
this
great
act
of
faith
and
devotion
the
streets
of
the
holy
city
were
washed
by
saracen
prisoners
but
whether
these
were
butchered
when
their
work
was
ended
we
are
not
told
four
centuries
and
a
half
had
passed
away
when
these
things
were
done
since
omar
had
entered
jerusalem
as
a
conqueror
and
knelt
outside
the
church
of
constantine
that
his
followers
might
not
trespass
within
it
on
the
privileges
of
the
christians
the
contrast
is
at
the
least
marked
between
the
caliph
of
the
prophet
and
the
children
of
the
holy
catholic
church
when
the
business
of
the
slaughter
being
ended
the
chiefs
met
to
choose
a
king
for
the
realm
which
they
had
won
with
their
swords
one
man
only
appeared
to
whom
the
crown
could
fitly
be
offered
baldwin
was
lord
of
edessa
bohemond
ruled
at
antioch
hugh
of
vermandois
and
stephen
of
chartres
had
returned
to
europe
robert
of
flanders
cared
not
to
stay
the
norman
robert
had
no
mind
to
forfeit
the
duchy
which
he
had
mortgaged
and
raymond
was
discredited
by
his
avarice
and
in
part
also
by
his
traffic
in
the
visions
of
peter
barthelemy
but
in
the
city
where
his
lord
had
worn
the
thorny
crown
the
veteran
leader
who
had
looked
on
ruthless
slaughter
without
blanching
and
had
borne
his
share
in
swelling
the
stream
of
blood
would
wear
no
earthly
diadem
nor
take
the
title
of
king
he
would
watch
over
his
master
grave
and
the
interests
of
his
worshippers
under
the
humble
guise
of
baron
and
defender
of
the
holy
sepulchre
and
as
such
a
fortnight
after
his
election
godfrey
departed
to
do
battle
with
the
hosts
of
the
fatimite
caliph
of
egypt
who
now
felt
that
the
loss
of
jerusalem
was
too
high
a
price
for
the
humiliation
of
his
rivals
the
conflict
took
place
at
ascalon
and
the
fatimite
army
was
miserably
routed
godfrey
returned
to
jerusalem
to
hang
the
sword
and
standard
of
the
sultan
before
the
holy
sepulchre
and
to
bid
farewell
to
the
pilgrims
who
were
now
to
set
out
on
their
homeward
journey
he
retained
with
three
hundred
knights
under
tancred
only
two
thousand
foot
soldiers
for
the
defence
of
his
kingdom
and
so
ended
the
first
act
in
the
great
drama
of
the
crusades
foundation
of
the
order
of
knights
templars
charles
addison
among
the
military
orders
of
past
ages
that
of
the
knights
templars
founded
for
the
defence
of
the
latin
kingdom
of
jerusalem
with
its
lofty
motive
its
superb
organization
and
discipline
and
its
history
extending
over
nearly
two
centuries
is
justly
accounted
one
of
the
most
illustrious
at
the
period
when
this
extraordinary
and
romantic
order
came
into
existence
the
contrasting
spirits
of
warlike
enterprise
and
monastic
retirement
were
drawing
men
some
from
the
field
to
the
cloister
others
from
the
life
of
ascetic
piety
to
the
scenes
of
strife
there
appeared
a
strange
blending
of
these
two
tendencies
which
indeed
was
the
leading
characteristic
of
the
time
this
union
of
the
religious
with
the
militant
spirit
had
been
promoted
by
the
enthusiasm
of
the
crusades
which
had
already
been
undertaken
and
among
the
crusaders
themselves
the
blended
spiritual
and
military
ideal
of
the
holy
war
had
its
complete
development
let
us
recall
the
reasons
and
the
beginnings
of
the
crusades
themselves
upon
the
legendary
discovery
of
the
holy
sepulchre
by
helena
the
mother
of
constantine
about
three
hundred
years
after
the
death
of
christ
and
the
consequent
erection
as
it
is
said
by
her
great
son
the
first
christian
emperor
of
rome
of
the
magnificent
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
over
the
sacred
spot
a
tide
of
pilgrimage
set
in
toward
jerusalem
which
increased
in
strength
as
christianity
gradually
spread
throughout
europe
when
in
the
holy
city
was
surrendered
to
the
saracens
the
caliph
omar
gave
guarantees
for
the
security
of
the
christian
population
under
this
safeguard
the
pilgrimages
to
jerusalem
continued
to
increase
until
in
the
holy
sepulchre
was
visited
by
seven
thousand
pilgrims
led
by
an
archbishop
and
three
bishops
but
in
jerusalem
was
taken
by
the
turcomans
who
massacred
three
thousand
citizens
and
placed
the
command
of
the
city
in
savage
hands
terrible
oppression
of
the
christians
there
followed
the
patriarch
of
jerusalem
was
dragged
by
the
hair
of
his
head
over
the
sacred
pavement
of
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
and
cast
into
a
dungeon
for
ransom
extortion
imprisonment
and
massacre
were
indiscriminately
visited
upon
the
people
such
were
the
conditions
that
aroused
the
indignant
spirit
of
christendom
and
prepared
it
for
the
cry
of
peter
the
hermit
which
awoke
the
wild
enthusiasm
of
the
crusades
when
jerusalem
was
captured
by
the
crusaders
under
godfrey
of
bouillon
in
the
zeal
of
pilgrimage
burst
forth
anew
but
although
jerusalem
was
delivered
palestine
was
still
infested
with
the
infidels
who
made
it
as
hazardous
as
before
for
the
pilgrims
entering
there
some
means
for
their
protection
must
be
found
and
out
of
this
necessity
grew
the
great
military
order
of
which
the
following
pages
treat
to
alleviate
the
dangers
and
distresses
to
which
the
pilgrim
enthusiasts
were
exposed
to
guard
the
honor
of
the
saintly
virgins
and
matrons
and
to
protect
the
gray
hairs
of
the
venerable
palmers
nine
noble
knights
formed
a
holy
and
entered
into
a
solemn
compact
to
aid
one
another
in
clearing
the
highways
of
infidels
and
robbers
and
in
protecting
the
pilgrims
through
the
passes
and
defiles
of
the
mountains
to
the
holy
city
warmed
with
the
religious
and
military
fervor
of
the
day
and
animated
by
the
sacredness
of
the
cause
to
which
they
had
devoted
their
swords
they
called
themselves
the
poor
of
jesus
christ
they
renounced
the
world
and
its
pleasures
and
in
the
holy
church
of
the
resurrection
in
the
presence
of
the
patriarch
of
jerusalem
they
embraced
vows
of
perpetual
chastity
obedience
and
poverty
after
the
manner
of
monks
uniting
in
themselves
the
two
most
popular
qualities
of
the
age
devotion
and
valor
and
exercising
them
in
the
most
popular
of
all
enterprises
the
protection
of
the
pilgrims
and
of
the
road
to
the
holy
sepulchre
they
speedily
acquired
a
vast
reputation
and
a
splendid
renown
at
first
we
are
told
they
had
no
church
and
no
particular
place
of
abode
but
in
the
year
of
our
lord
nineteen
years
after
the
conquest
of
jerusalem
by
the
crusaders
they
had
rendered
such
good
and
acceptable
service
to
the
christians
that
baldwin
ii
king
of
jerusalem
granted
them
a
place
of
habitation
within
the
sacred
enclosure
of
the
temple
on
mount
moriah
amid
those
holy
and
magnificent
structures
partly
erected
by
the
christian
emperor
justinian
and
partly
built
by
the
caliph
omar
which
were
then
exhibited
by
the
monks
and
priests
of
jerusalem
whose
restless
zeal
led
them
to
practise
on
the
credulity
of
the
pilgrims
and
to
multiply
relics
and
all
objects
likely
to
be
sacred
in
their
eyes
as
the
temple
of
solomon
whence
the
poor
of
jesus
christ
came
thenceforth
to
be
known
by
the
name
of
the
knighthood
of
the
temple
of
solomon
a
few
remarks
in
elucidation
of
the
name
templars
or
knights
of
the
temple
may
not
be
unacceptable
by
the
mussulmans
the
site
of
the
great
jewish
temple
on

has
always
been
regarded
with
peculiar
veneration

followers
when
at
prayer
to
turn
their
faces
toward
it
and
pilgrimages
have
constantly
been
made
to
the
holy
spot
by
devout
moslems
on
the
conquest
of
jerusalem
by
the
arabians
it
was
the
first
care
of
the
caliph
omar
to
rebuild
the
temple
of
the
lord
assisted
by
the
principal
chieftains
of
his
army
the
commander
of
the
faithful
undertook
the
pious
office
of
clearing
the
ground
with
his
own
hands
and
of
tracing
out
the
foundations
of
the
magnificent
mosque
which
now
crowns
with
its
dark
and
swelling
dome
the
elevated
summit
of

great
house

most
holy

erected
over
the
spot
where
solomon
began
to
build
the
house
of
the
lord
at
jerusalem
in

the
lord
appeared
unto

prepared
in
the

oman
the
jebusite
it
remains
to
this

in
a
state
of
perfect
preservation
and
is
one
of
the
finest
specimens
of

derives
its

while
the
governors

instead
of

take
the
simple
title
of
or
protectors
on
the
conquest
of
jerusalem
by
the
crusaders
the
crescent
was
torn
down
from
the
summit
of
this
famous
mussulman
temple
and
was
replaced
by
an
immense
golden
cross
and
the
edifice
was
then
consecrated
to
the
services
of
the
christian
religion
but
retained
its
simple
appellation
of
the
temple
of
the
lord
william
archbishop
of

and
chancellor
of
the
kingdom
of
jerusalem
gives
an
interesting
account
of
this
famous
edifice
as
it
existed
in
his
time
during
the
latin
dominion
he
speaks
of
the
splendid
mosaic
work
of
the
arabic
characters
setting
forth
the
name
of
the
founder
and
the
cost
of
the
undertaking
and
of
the
famous
rock
under
the
centre
of
the
dome
which
is
to
this
day
shown
by
the
moslems
as
the
spot
whereon
the
destroying
angel
stood
with
his
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
stretched
out
over
jerusalem
this
rock
he
informs
us
was
left
exposed
and
uncovered
for
the
space
of
fifteen
years
after
the
conquest
of
the
holy
city
by
the
crusaders
but
was
after
that
period
cased
with
a
handsome
altar
of
white
marble
upon
which
the
priests
daily
said
mass
to
the
south
of
this
holy
mussulman
temple
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
summit
of
mount
moriah
and
resting
against
the
modern
walls
of
the
town
of
jerusalem
stands
the
venerable
church
of
the
virgin
erected
by
the
emperor
justinian
whose
stupendous
foundations
remaining
to
this
day
fully
justify
the
astonishing
description
given
of
the
building
by
procopius
that
writer
informs
us
that
in
order
to
get
a
level
surface
for
the
erection
of
the
edifice
it
was
necessary
on
the
east
and
south
sides
of
the
hill
to
raise
up
a
wall
of
masonry
from
the
valley
below
and
to
construct
a
vast
foundation
partly
composed
of
solid
stone
and
partly
of
arches
and
pillars
the
stones
were
of
such
magnitude
that
each
block
required
to
be
transported
in
a
truck
drawn
by
forty
of
the
emperor
strongest
oxen
and
to
admit
of
the
passage
of
these
trucks
it
was
necessary
to
widen
the
roads
leading
to
jerusalem
the
forests
of
lebanon
yielded
their
choicest
cedars
for
the
timbers
of
the
roof
and
a
quarry
of
variegated
marble
seasonably
discovered
in
the
adjoining
mountains
furnished
the
edifice
with
superb
marble
columns
the
interior
of
this
interesting
structure
which
still
remains
at
jerusalem
after
a
lapse
of
more
than
thirteen
centuries
in
an
excellent
state
of
preservation
is
adorned
with
six
rows
of
columns
from
whence
spring
arches
supporting
the
cedar
beams
and
timbers
of
the
roof
and
at
the
end
of
the
building
is
a
round
tower
surmounted
by
a
dome
the
vast
stones
the
walls
of
masonry
and
the
subterranean
colonnade
raised
to
support
the
southeast
angle
of
the
platform
whereon
the
church
is
erected
are
truly
wonderful
and
may
still
be
seen
by
penetrating
through
a
small
door
and
descending
several
flights
of
steps
at
the
southeast
corner
of
the
enclosure
adjoining
the
sacred
edifice
the
emperor
erected
hospitals
or
houses
of
refuge
for
travellers
sick
people
and
mendicants
of
all
nations
the
foundations
whereof
composed
of
handsome
roman
masonry
are
still
visible
on
either
side
of
the
southern
end
of
the
building
on
the
conquest
of
jerusalem
by
the
moslems
this
venerable
church
was
converted
into
a
mosque
and
was
called
al
acsa
it
was
enclosed
together
with
the
great
mussulman
temple
of
the
lord
erected
by

within
a
large
area
by
a
high
stone
wall
which
runs
around
the
edge
of
the
summit
of
mount
moriah
and
guards
from
the
profane
tread
of
the
unbeliever
the
whole
of
that
sacred
ground
whereon
once
stood
the
gorgeous
temple
of
the
wisest
of
kings
when
the
holy
city
was
taken
by
the
crusaders
the
al
acsa
with
the
various
buildings
constructed
around
it
became
the
property
of
the
kings
of
jerusalem
and
is
denominated
by
william
of
tyre
the
palace
or
royal
house
to
the
south
of
the
temple
of
the
lord
vulgarly
called
the
of
solomon
it
was
this
edifice
or
temple
on
mount
moriah
which
was
appropriated
to
the
use
of
the
poor
of
jesus
christ
as
they
had
no
church
and
no
particular
place
of
abode
and
from
it
they
derived
their
name
of
knights
templars
james
of
vitry
bishop
of
acre
who
gives
an
interesting
account
of
the
holy
places
thus
speaks
of
the
temple
of
the
knights
templars
there
is
moreover
at
jerusalem
another
temple
of
immense
spaciousness
and
extent
from
which
the
brethren
of
the
knighthood
of
the
temple
derive
their
name
of
which
is
called
the
of
solomon
perhaps
to
distinguish
it
from
the
one
above
described
which
is
specially
called
the
of
the
lord
he
moreover
informs
us
in
his
oriental
history
that
in
the
of
the
lord
there
is
an
abbot
and
canons
regular
and
be
it
known
that
the
one
is
the
of
the
and
the
other
the
of
the
these
are
the
others
are
the
canons
of
the
temple
of
the
lord
conceded
to
the
poor
of
jesus
christ
the
large
court
extending
between
that
building
and
the
temple
of
solomon
the
king
the
patriarch
and
the
prelates
of
jerusalem
and
the
barons
of
the
latin
kingdom
assigned
them
various
gifts
and
revenues
for
their
maintenance
and
support
and
the
order
being
now
settled
in
a
regular
place
of
abode
the
knights
soon
began
to
entertain
more
extended
views
and
to
seek
a
larger
theatre
for
the
exercise
of
their
holy
profession
their
first
aim
and
object
had
been
as
before
mentioned
simply
to
protect
the
poor
pilgrims
on
their
journey
backward
and
forward
from
the
to
jerusalem
but
as
the
hostile
tribes
of
mussulmans
which
everywhere
surrounded
the
latin
kingdom
were
gradually
recovering
from
the
stupefying
terror
into
which
they
had
been
plunged
by
the
successful
and
exterminating
warfare
of
the
first
crusaders
and
were
assuming
an
aggressive
and
threatening
attitude
it
was
determined
that
the
holy
warriors
of
the
temple
should
in
addition
to
the
protection
of
pilgrims
make
the
defence
of
the
christian
kingdom
of
jerusalem
of
the
eastern
church
and
of
all
the
holy
places
a
part
of
their
particular
profession
the
two
most
distinguished
members
of
the
fraternity
were
hugh
de
payens
and
geoffrey
de
aldemar
or
omer
two
valiant
soldiers
of
the
cross
who
had
fought
with
great
credit
and
renown
at
the
siege
of
jerusalem
hugh
de
payens
was
chosen
by
the
knights
to
be
superior
of
the
new
religious
and
military
society
by
the
title
of
the
master
of
the
temple
and
he
has
in
consequence
been
generally
called
the
founder
of
the
order
the
name
and
reputation
of
the
knights
templars
speedily
spread
throughout
europe
and
various
illustrious
pilgrims
of
the
far
west
aspired
to
become
members
of
the
holy
fraternity
among
these
was
fulk
count
of
anjou
who
joined
the
society
as
a
married
brother
and
annually
remitted
the
order
thirty
pounds
of
silver
baldwin
king
of
jerusalem
foreseeing
that
great
advantages
would
accrue
to
the
latin
kingdom
by
the
increase
of
the
power
and
numbers
of
these
holy
warriors
exerted
himself
to
extend
the
order
throughout
all
christendom
so
that
he
might
by
means
of
so
politic
an
institution
keep
alive
the
holy
enthusiasm
of
the
west
and
draw
a
constant
succor
from
the
bold
and
warlike
races
of
europe
for
the
support
of
his
christian
throne
and
kingdom
bernard
the
holy
abbot
of
clairvaux
had
been
a
great
admirer
of
the
templars
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
count
of
champagne
on
his
entering
the
order
praising
the
act
as
one
of
eminent
merit
in
the
sight
of
god
and
it
was
determined
to
enlist
the
influence
of
this
great
ecclesiastic
in
favor
of
the
fraternity
by
a
vow
of
poverty
and
penance
by
closing
his
eyes
against
the
visible
world
by
the
refusal
of
all
ecclesiastical
dignities
the
abbot
of
clairvaux
became
the
oracle
of
europe
and
the
founder
of
one
hundred
and
sixty
convents
princes
and
pontiffs
trembled
at
the
freedom
of
his
apostolical
censures
france
england
and
milan
consulted
and
obeyed
his
judgment
in
a
schism
of
the
church
the
debt
was
repaid
by
the
gratitude
of
innocent

and
his
successor
eugenius
iii
was
the
friend
and
disciple
of
the
holy
st
bernard
to
this
learned
and
devout
prelate
two
knights
templars
were
despatched
with
the
following
letter
baldwin
by
the
grace
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
king
of
jerusalem
and
prince
of
antioch
to
the
venerable
father
bernard
abbot
of
clairvaux
health
and
regard
the
brothers
of
the
temple
whom
the
lord
hath
deigned
to
raise
up
and
whom
by
an
especial
providence
he
preserves
for
the
defence
of
this
kingdom
desiring
to
obtain
from
the
holy
see
the
confirmation
of
their
institution
and
a
rule
for
their
particular
guidance
we
have
determined
to
send
to
you
the
two
knights
andrew
and
gondemar
men
as
much
distinguished
by
their
military
exploits
as
by
the
splendor
of
their
birth
to
obtain
from
the
pope
the
approbation
of
their
order
and
to
dispose
his
holiness
to
send
succor
and
subsidies
against
the
enemies
of
the
faith
reunited
in
their
design
to
destroy
us
and
to
invade
our
christian
territories
well
knowing
the
weight
of
your
mediation
with
god
and
his
vicar
upon
earth
as
well
as
with
the
princes
and
powers
of
europe
we
have
thought
fit
to
confide
to
you
these
two
important
matters
whose
successful
issue
can
not
be
otherwise
than
most
agreeable
to
ourselves
the
statutes
we
ask
of
you
should
be
so
ordered
and
arranged
as
to
be
reconcilable
with
the
tumult
of
the
camp
and
the
profession
of
arms
they
must
in
fact
be
of
such
a
nature
as
to
obtain
favor
and
popularity
with
the
christian
princes
do
you
then
so
manage
that
we
may
through
you
have
the
happiness
of
seeing
this
important
affair
brought
to
a
successful
issue
and
address
for
us
to
heaven
the
incense
of
your
prayers
soon
after
the
above
letter
had
been
despatched
to
bernard
hugh
de
payens
himself
proceeded
to
rome
accompanied
by
geoffrey
de

geoffrey
bisol
and
brother
archambauld
de
armand
they
were
received
with
great
honor
and
distinction
by
pope
honorius
who
warmly
approved
of
the
objects
and
designs
of
the
holy
fraternity
bernard
had
in
the
mean
time
taken
the
affair
greatly
to
heart
he
negotiated
with
the
pope
the
legate
and
the
bishops
of
france
and
obtained
the
convocation
of
a
great
ecclesiastical
council
at
troyes
which
hugh
de
payens
and
his
brethren
were
invited
to
attend
this
council
consisted
of
several
archbishops
bishops
and
abbots
among
which
last
was
bernard
himself
the
rules
to
which
the
templars
had
subjected
themselves
were
there
described
by
the
master
and
to
the
holy
abbot
of
clairvaux
was
confided
the
task
of
revising
and
correcting
these
rules
and
of
framing
a
code
of
statutes
fit
and
proper
for
the
governance
of
the
great
religious
and
military
fraternity
of
the
temple

of
the
poor
of
jesus

and
of
the

by
bernard
and

for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
monastic
and
military
society
of
the
temple

principally
of
a
religious
character
and
of
an
austere
and
gloomy
cast
it
is
divided
into
heads
or
chapters
and
is
preceded
by
a
short
prologue
addressed
to
all
who
disdain
to
follow
after
their
own
wills
and
desire
with
purity
of
mind
to
fight
for
the
most
high
and
true
king
exhorting
them
to
put
on
the
armor
of
obedience
and
to
associate
themselves
together
with
piety
and
humility
for
the
defence
of
the
holy
catholic
church
and
to
employ
a
pure
diligence
and
a
steady
perseverance
in
the
exercise
of
their
sacred
profession
so
that
they
might
share
in
the
happy
destiny
reserved
for
the
holy
warriors

refreshed
and
satisfied
with
heavenly
food
instructed
and
stablished
with
heavenly
precepts
after
the

and
most
tender
charity

do
daily

as
much

this
same
year
hugh
of
the
temple
came
from
jerusalem
to
the
king
in
normandy
and
the
king
received
him
with
much
honor
and
gave
him
much
treasure
in
gold
and
silver
and
afterward
he
sent
him
into
england
and
there
he
was
well
received
by
all
good
men
and
all
gave
him
treasure
and
in
scotland
also
and
they
sent
in
all
a
great
sum
in
gold
and
silver
by
him
to
jerusalem
and
there
went
with
him
and
after
him
so
great
a
number
as
never
before
since
the
days
of
pope
urban
grants
of
land
as
well
as
of
money
were
at
the
same
time
made
to
hugh
de
payens
and
his
brethren
some
of
which
were
shortly
afterward
confirmed
by
king
stephen
on
his
accession
to
the
throne
among
these
is
a
grant
of
the
manor
of
bistelesham
made
to
the
templars
by
count
robert
de
ferrara
and
a
grant
of
the
church
of
langeforde
in
bedfordshire
made
by
simon
de
wahull
and
sibylla
his
wife
and
walter
their
son
hugh
de
payens
before
his
departure
placed
a
knight
templar
at
the
head
of
the
order
in
england
who
was
called
the
prior
of
the
temple
and
was
the
procurator
and
viceregent
of
the
master
it
was
his
duty
to
manage
the
estates
granted
to
the
fraternity
and
to
transmit
the
revenues
to
jerusalem
he
was
also
delegated
with
the
power
of
admitting
members
into
the
order
subject
to
the
control
and
direction
of
the
master
and
was
to
provide
means
of
transport
for
such
brethren
to
the
far
east
to
enable
them
to
fulfil
the
duties
of
their
profession
as
the
houses
of
the
temple
increased
in
number
in
england
subpriors
came
to
be
appointed
and
the
superior
of
the
order
in
this
country
was
then
called
the
grand
prior
and
afterward
master
of
the
temple
many
illustrious
knights
of
the
best
families
in
europe
aspired
to
the
habit
and
vows
but
however
exalted
their
rank
they
were
not
received
within
the
bosom
of
the
fraternity
until
they
had
proved
themselves
by
their
conduct
worthy
of
such
a
fellowship
thus
when
hugh
who
had
harassed
and
oppressed
the
people
of
marmontier
by
unjust
exactions
and
had
refused
to
submit
to
the
judicial
decision
of
the
count
of
anjou
desired
to
enter
the
order
hugh
de
payens
refused
to
admit
him
to
the
vows
until
he
had
humbled
himself
renounced
his
pretensions
and
given
perfect
satisfaction
to
those
whom
he
had
injured
the
candidates
moreover
previous
to
their
admission
were
required
to
make
reparation
and
satisfaction
for
all
damage
done
by
them
at
any
time
to
churches
and
to
public
or
private
property
an
astonishing
enthusiasm
was
excited
throughout
christendom
in
behalf
of
the
templars
princes
and
nobles
sovereigns
and
their
subjects
vied
with
each
other
in
heaping
gifts
and
benefits
upon
them
and
scarce
a
will
of
importance
was
made
without
an
article
in
it
in
their
favor
many
illustrious
persons
on
their
took
the
vows
that
they
might
be
buried
in
the
habit
of
the
order
and
sovereigns
quitting
the
government
of
their
kingdoms
enrolled
themselves
among
the
holy
fraternity
and
bequeathed
even
their
dominions
to
the
master
and
the
brethren
of
the
temple
thus
raymond
berenger
count
of
barcelona
and
provence
at
a
very
advanced
age
abdicating
his
throne
and
shaking
off
the
ensigns
of
royal
authority
retired
to
the
house
of
the
templars
at
barcelona
and
pronounced
his
vows
before
brother
hugh
de
rigauld
the
prior
his
infirmities
not
allowing
him
to
proceed
in
person
to
the
chief
house
of
the
order
at
jerusalem
he
sent
vast
sums
of
money
thither
and
immuring
himself
in
a
small
cell
in
the
temple
at
barcelona
he
there
remained
in
the
constant
exercise
of
the
religious
duties
of
his
profession
until
the
day
of
his
death
at
the
same
period
the
emperor
lothair
bestowed
on
the
order
a
large
portion
of
his
patrimony
of
supplinburg
and
the
year
following
alphonso
i
king
of
navarre
and
aragon
also
styled
emperor
of
spain
one
of
the
greatest
warriors
of
the
age
by
his
will
declared
the
knights
of
the
temple
his
heirs
and
successors
in
the
crowns
of
navarre
and
aragon
and
a
few
hours
before
his
death
he
caused
this
will
to
be
ratified
and
signed
by
most
of
the
barons
of
both
kingdoms
the
validity
of
this
document
however
was
disputed
and
the
claims
of
the
templars
were
successfully
resisted
by
the
nobles
of
navarre
but
in
aragon
they
obtained
by
way
of
compromise
lands
and
castles
and
considerable
dependencies
a
portion
of
the
customs
and
duties
levied
throughout
the
kingdom
and
the
contributions
raised
from
the
moors
to
increase
the
enthusiasm
in
favor
of
the
templars
and
still
further
to
swell
their
ranks
with
the
best
and
bravest
of
the
european
chivalry
bernard
at
the
request
of
hugh
de
payens
took
up
his
powerful
pen
in
their
behalf
in
a
famous
discourse
praise
of
the
new
the
holy
abbot
sets
forth
in
eloquent
and
enthusiastic
terms
the
spiritual
advantages
and
blessings
enjoyed
by
the
military
friars
of
the
temple
over
all
other
warriors
he
draws
a
curious
picture
of
the
relative
situations
and
circumstances
of
the
soldiery
and
the
soldiery
of
and
shows
how
different
in
the
sight
of
god
are
the
bloodshed
and
slaughter
of
the
one
from
that
committed
by
the
other
this
extraordinary
discourse
is
written
with
great
spirit
it
is
addressed
to
hugh
knight
of
christ
and
master
of
the
knighthood
of
christ
is
divided
into
fourteen
parts
or
chapters
and
commences
with
a
short
prologue
it
is
curiously
illustrative
of
the
spirit
of
the
times
and
some
of
its
most
striking
passages
will
be
read
with
interest
the
holy
abbot
thus
pursues
his
comparison
between
the
soldier
of
the
world
and
the
soldier
of
christ
the
and
the
warrior
as
often
as
thou
who
wagest
a
secular
warfare
marchest
forth
to
battle
it
is
greatly
to
be
feared
lest
when
thou
slayest
thine
enemy
in
the
body
he
should
destroy
thee
in
the
spirit
or
lest
peradventure
thou
shouldst
be
at
once
slain
by
him
both
in
body
and
soul
from
the
disposition
of
the
heart
indeed
not
by
the
event
of
the
fight
is
to
be
estimated
either
the
jeopardy
or
the
victory
of
the
christian
if
fighting
with
the
desire
of
killing
another
thou
shouldst
chance
to
get
killed
thyself
thou
diest
a
manslayer
if
on
the
other
hand
thou
prevailest
and
through
a
desire
of
conquest
or
revenge
killest
a
man
thou
livest
a
manslayer
o
unfortunate
victory
when
in
overcoming
thine
adversary
thou
fallest
into
sin
and
anger
or
pride
having
the
mastery
over
thee
in
vain
thou
gloriest
over
the
vanquished
what
therefore
is
the
fruit
of
this
secular
i
will
not
say
but
if
the
slayer
committeth
a
deadly
sin
and
the
slain
perisheth
eternally
verily
to
use
the
words
of
the
apostle
he
that
plougheth
should
plough
in
hope
and
he
that
thresheth
should
be
partaker
of
his
hope
whence
therefore
o
soldiers
cometh
this
so
stupendous
error
what
insufferable
madness
is
this
to
wage
war
with
so
great
cost
and
labor
but
with
no
pay
except
either
death
or
crime
ye
cover
your
horses
with
silken
trappings
and
i
know
not
how
much
fine
cloth
hangs
pendent
from
your
coats
of
mail
ye
paint
your
spears
shields
and
saddles
your
bridles
and
spurs
are
adorned
on
all
sides
with
gold
and
silver
and
gems
and
with
all
this
pomp
with
a
shameful
fury
and
a
reckless
insensibility
ye
rush
on
to
death
are
these
military
ensigns
or
are
they
not
rather
the
garnishments
of
women
can
it
happen
that
the
sword
of
the
enemy
will
respect
gold
will
it
spare
gems
will
it
be
unable
to
penetrate
the
silken
garment
as
ye
yourselves
have
often
experienced
three
things
are
indispensably
necessary
to
the
success
of
the
soldier
he
must
for
example
be
bold
active
and
circumspect
quick
in
running
prompt
in
striking
ye
however
to
the
disgust
of
the
eye
nourish
your
hair
after
the
manner
of
women
ye
gather
around
your
footsteps
long
and
flowing
vestures
ye
bury
up
your
delicate
and
tender
hands
in
ample
and
sleeves
among
you
indeed
naught
provoketh
war
or
awakeneth
strife
but
either
an
irrational
impulse
of
anger
or
an
insane
lust
of
glory
or
the
covetous
desire
of
possessing
another
man
lands
and
possessions
in
such
cases
it
is
neither
safe
to
slay
nor
to
be
slain
but
the
soldiers
of
christ
indeed
securely
fight
the
battles
of
their
lord
in
no
wise
fearing
sin
either
from
the
slaughter
of
the
enemy
or
danger
from
their
own
death
when
indeed
death
is
to
be
given
or
received
for
christ
it
has
naught
of
crime
in
it
but
much
of
glory
and
now
for
an
example
or
to
the
confusion
of
our
soldiers
fighting
not
manifestly
for
god
but
for
the
devil
we
will
briefly
display
the
mode
of
life
of
the
knights
of
christ
such
as
it
is
in
the
field
and
in
the
convent
by
which
means
it
will
be
made
plainly
manifest
to
what
extent
the
soldiery
of
god
and
the
soldiery
of
the
world
differ
from
one
another
the
soldiers
of
christ
live
together
in
common
in
an
agreeable
but
frugal
manner
without
wives
and
without
children
and
that
nothing
may
be
wanting
to
evangelical
perfection
they
dwell
together
without
property
of
any
kind
in
one
house
under
one
rule
careful
to
preserve
the
unity
of
the
spirit
in
the
bond
of
peace
you
may
say
that
to
the
whole
multitude
there
is
but
one
heart
and
one
soul
as
each
one
in
no
respect
followeth
after
his
own
will
or
desire
but
is
diligent
to
do
the
will
of
the
master
they
are
never
idle
nor
rambling
abroad
but
when
they
are
not
in
the
field
that
they
may
not
eat
their
bread
in
idleness
they
are
fitting
and
repairing
their
armor
and
their
clothing
or
employing
themselves
in
such
occupations
as
the
will
of
the
master
requireth
or
their
common
necessities
render
expedient
among
them
there
is
no
distinction
of
persons
respect
is
paid
to
the
best
and
most
virtuous
not
the
most
noble
they
participate
in
each
honor
they
bear
one
anothers
burdens
that
they
may
fulfil
the
law
of
christ
an
insolent
expression
a
useless
undertaking
immoderate
laughter
the
least
murmur
or
whispering
if
found
out
passeth
not
without
severe
rebuke
they
detest
cards
and
dice
they
shun
the
sports
of
the
field
and
take
no
delight
in
the
ludicrous
catching
of
birds
hawking
which
men
are
wont
to
indulge
in
jesters
and
soothsayers
and
scurrilous
songs
shows
and
games
they
contemptuously
despise
and
abominate
as
vanities
and
mad
follies
they
cut
their
hair
knowing
that
according
to
the
apostle
it
is
not
seemly
in
a
man
to
have
long
hair
they
are
never
combed
seldom
washed
but
appear
rather
with
rough
neglected
hair
foul
with
dust
and
with
skins
browned
by
the
sun
and
their
coats
of
mail
moreover
on
the
approach
of
battle
they
fortify
themselves
with
faith
within
and
with
steel
without
and
not
with
gold
so
that
armed
and
not
adorned
they
may
strike
terror
into
the
enemy
rather
than
awaken
his
lust
of
plunder
they
strive
earnestly
to
possess
strong
and
swift
horses
but
not
garnished
with
ornaments
or
decked
with
trappings
thinking
of
battle
and
of
victory
and
not
of
pomp
and
show
studying
to
inspire
fear
rather
than
admiration
such
hath
god
chosen
for
his
own
and
hath
collected
together
as
his
ministers
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
from
among
the
bravest
of
israel
who
indeed
vigilantly
and
faithfully
guard
the
holy
sepulchre
all
armed
with
the
sword
and
most
learned
in
the
art
of
war
there
is
indeed
a
temple
at
jerusalem
in
which
they
dwell
together
unequal
it
is
true
as
a
building
to
that
ancient
and
most
famous
one
of
solomon
but
not
inferior
in
glory
for
truly
the
entire
magnificence
of
that
consisted
in
corrupt
things
in
gold
and
silver
in
carved
stone
and
in
a
variety
of
woods
but
the
whole
beauty
of
this
resteth
in
the
adornment
of
an
agreeable
conversation
in
the
godly
devotion
of
its
inmates
and
their
beautifully
ordered
mode
of
life
that
was
admired
for
its
various
external
beauties
this
is
venerated
for
its
different
virtues
and
sacred
actions
as
becomes
the
sanctity
of
the
house
of
god
who
delighteth
not
so
much
in
polished
marbles
as
in
behavior
and
regardeth
pure
minds
more
than
gilded
walls
the
face
likewise
of
this
temple
is
adorned
with
arms
not
with
gems
and
the
wall
instead
of
the
ancient
golden
chapiters
is
covered
around
with
pendent
shields
instead
of
the
ancient
candelabra
censers
and
lavers
the
house
is
on
all
sides
furnished
with
bridles
saddles
and
lances
all
which
plainly
demonstrate
that
the
soldiers
burn
with
the
same
zeal
for
the
house
of
god
as
that
which
formerly
animated
their
great
leader
when
vehemently
enraged
he
entered
into
the
temple
and
with
that
most
sacred
hand
armed
not
with
steel
but
with
a
scourge
which
he
had
made
of
small
thongs
drove
out
the
merchants
poured
out
the
changers
money
and
overthrew
the
tables
of
them
that
sold
doves
most
indignantly
condemning
the
pollution
of
the
house
of
prayer
by
the
making
of
it
a
place
of
merchandise
the
devout
army
of
christ
therefore
earnestly
incited
by
the
example
of
its
king
thinking
indeed
that
the
holy
places
are
much
more
impiously
and
insufferably
polluted
by
the
infidels
than
when
defiled
by
merchants
abide
in
the
holy
house
with
horses
and
with
arms
so
that
from
that
as
well
as
all
the
other
sacred
places
all
filthy
and
diabolical
madness
of
infidelity
being
driven
out
they
may
occupy
themselves
by
day
and
by
night
in
honorable
and
useful
offices
they
emulously
honor
the
temple
of
god
with
sedulous
and
sincere
oblations
offering
sacrifices
therein
with
constant
devotion
not
indeed
of
the
flesh
of
cattle
after
the
manner
of
the
ancients
but
peaceful
sacrifices
brotherly
love
devout
obedience
voluntary
poverty
these
things
are
done
perpetually
at
jerusalem
and
the
world
is
aroused
the
islands
hear
and
the
nations
take
heed
from
afar
bernard
then
congratulates
jerusalem
on
the
advent
of
the
soldiers
of
christ
and
declares
that
the
holy
city
will
rejoice
with
a
double
joy
in
being
rid
of
all
her
oppressors
the
ungodly
the
robbers
the
blasphemers
murderers
perjurers
and
adulterers
and
in
receiving
her
faithful
defenders
and
sweet
consolers
under
the
shadow
of
whose
protection
mount
zion
shall
rejoice
and
the
daughters
of

for
joy

unfortunately
were

hastened
to

and
notwithstanding
some
opposition
with
the
help
of
his
clerical
brother
and
other
functionaries
had
himself
proclaimed
and
crowned

this
act
involved
england
in
years
of

anarchy
and
wretchedness
which
ended
only
with
the
accession
as
henry

of

son
henry

of
the
reign
of
stephen
sir
james
mackintosh
has
said
it
perhaps
contains
the
most
perfect
condensation
of
all
the
ills
of
feudality
to
be
found
in
history
he
adds
the
whole
narrative
would
have
been
rejected
as
devoid
of
all
likeness
to
truth
if
it
had
been
hazarded
in
fiction
as
a
picture
of
all
the
ills
of
feudality
this
narrative
is
a
picture
of
the
entire
social
state
the
monarchy
the
church
the
aristocracy
the
people
and
appears
to
us
therefore
to
demand
a
more
careful
examination
than
if
the
historical
interest
were
chiefly
centred
in
the
battles
and
adventures
belonging
to
a
disputed
succession
and
in
the
personal
characters
of
a
courageous
princess
and
her
knightly
rival
stephen
earl
of
boulogne
the
nephew
of
king
henry
i
was
no
stranger
to
the
country
which
he
aspired
to
rule
he
had
lived
much
in
england
and
was
a
universal
favorite
from
his
complacency
of
manners
and
his
readiness
to
joke
and
sit
and
regale
even
with
low
people
he
had
gained
so
much
on
their
affections
as
is
hardly
to
be
conceived
this
popular
man
was
at
the
of
his
uncle
but
before
the
royal
body
was
borne
on
the
shoulders
of
nobles
from
the
castle
of
lions
to
rouen
stephen
was
on
his
road
to
england
he
embarked
at
whitsand
undeterred
by
boisterous
weather
and
landed
during
a
winter
storm
of
thunder
and
lightning
it
was
a
more
evil
omen
when
dover
and
canterbury
shut
their
gates
against
him
but
he
went
boldly
on
to
london
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
his
proceedings
were
not
the
result
of
a
sudden
impulse
and
that
his
usurpation
of
the
crown
was
successful
through
a
very
powerful
organization
his
brother
henry
was
bishop
of
winchester
and
his
influence
with
the
other
dignitaries
of
the
church
was
mainly
instrumental
in
the
election
of
stephen
to
be
king
in
open
disregard
of
the
oaths
taken
a
few
years
before
to
recognize
the
succession
of
matilda
and
of
her
son
between
the
death
of
a
king
and
the
coronation
of
his
successor
there
was
usually
a
short
interval
in
which
the
form
of
election
was
gone
through
but
it
is
held
that
during
that
suspension
of
the
royal
functions
there
was
usually
a
proclamation
of
the
peace
under
which
all
violations
of
law
were
punished
as
if
the
head
of
the
law
were
in
the
full
exercise
of
his
functions
and
dignities
king
henry
i
died
on
the
of
december
stephen
was
crowned
on
the
of
december
the
death
of
henry
would
probably
have
been
generally
known
in
england
in
a
week
after
the
event
there
is
a
sufficient
proof
that
this
succession
was
considered
doubtful
and
consequently
that
there
was
an
unusual
delay
in
the
proclamation
of
the
king
peace
the
forest
laws
were
the
great
grievance
of
reign
his
death
was
the
signal
for
their
violation
by
the
whole
body
of
the
people
it
was
wonderful
how
so
many
myriads
of
wild
animals
which
in
large
herds
before
plentifully
stocked
the
country
suddenly
disappeared
so
that
out
of
the
vast
number
scarcely
two
now
could
be
found
together
they
seemed
to
be
entirely
extirpated
according
to
the
same
authority
the
people
also
turned
to
plundering
each
other
without
mercy
and
whatever
the
evil
passions
suggested
in
peaceable
times
now
that
the
opportunity
of
vengeance
presented
itself
was
quickly
executed
this
is
a
remarkable
condition
of
a
country
which
having
been
governed
by
terror
suddenly
passed
out
of
the
evils
of
despotism
into
the
greater
evils
of
anarchy
this
temporary
confusion
must
have
contributed
to
urge
on
the
election
of
stephen
by
the
londoners
he
was
received
with
acclamations
and
the
chose
him
for
king
without
hesitation
as
one
who
could
best
fulfil
the
duties
of
the
office
and
put
an
end
to
the
dangers
of
the
kingdom
stephen
succeeded
to
a
vast
amount
of
treasure
all
the
rents
of
henry
i
had
been
paid
in
money
instead
of
in
necessaries
and
he
was
rigid
in
enforcing
the
payment
in
coin
of
the
best
quality
with
this
possession
of
means
stephen
surrounded
himself
with
troops
from
flanders
and
brittany
the
objections
to
his
want
of
hereditary
right
appear
to
have
been
altogether
laid
aside
for
a
time
in
the
popularity
which
he
derived
from
his
personal
qualities
and
his
command
of
wealth
strict
hereditary
claims
to
the
choice
of
the
nation
had
been
disregarded
since
the
time
of
the
confessor
the
oath
to
matilda
it
was
maintained
had
been
unwillingly
given
and
even
extorted
by
force
it
is
easy
to
conceive
that
both
to
saxon
and
norman
the
notion
of
a
female
sovereign
would
be
out
of
harmony
with
their
ancient
traditions
and
their
warlike
habits
the
king
was
the
great
military
chief
as
well
as
the
supreme
dispenser
of
justice
and
guardian
of
property
the
time
was
far
distant
when
the
sovereign
rule
might
be
held

being
coördinate

strengthening
as
well
as

authority
might
be
safely
and
happily
exercised
by
a
discreet
energetic
and
just
female
king
stephen
vindicated
the
choice
of
the
nation
at
the
very
outset
of
his
reign
he
went
in
person
against
the
robbers
who
were
ravaging
the
country
the
daughter
of
the
lion
of
justice
would
probably
have
done
the
same
but
more
than
three
hundred
years
had
passed
since
the
lady
of
mercia
the
sister
of
alfred
had
asserted
the
courage
of
her
race
norman
and
saxon
wanted
a
king
for
though
ladies
defended
castles
and
showed
that
firmness
and
bravery
were
not
the
exclusive
possession
of
one
sex
no
thane
or
baron
had
yet
knelt
before
a
queen
and
sworn
to
be
her
liege
man
of
life
and
limb
the
unanimity
which
appeared
to
hail
the
accession
of
stephen
was
soon
interrupted
david
king
of
scotland
had
advanced
to
carlisle
and
newcastle
to
assert
the
claim
of
matilda
which
he
had
sworn
to
uphold
but
stephen
came
against
him
with
a
great
army
and
for
a
time
there
was
peace
robert
earl
of
gloucester
the
illegitimate
son
of
henry
i
had
done
homage
to
stephen
but
his
allegiance
was
very
doubtful
and
the
general
belief
that
he
would
renounce
his
fealty
engendered
secret
hostility
or
open
resistance
among
other
powerful
barons
robert
of
gloucester
very
soon
defied
the
king
power
within
two
years
of
his
accession
the
throne
of
stephen
was
evidently
becoming
an
insecure
seat
to
counteract
the
power
of
the
great
nobles
he
made
a
lavish
distribution
of
crown
lands
to
a
large
number
of
some
of
them
were
called
earls
but
they
had
no
official
charge
as
the
greater
barons
had
but
were
mere
titular
lords
made
by
the
royal
bounty
all
those
who
held
direct
from
the
crown
were
called
barons
and
these
new
barons
who
were
scattered
over
the
country
had
permission
from
the
king
to
build
castles
such
permission
was
extended
to
many
other
lay
barons
the
accustomed
of
the
land
proprietor
in
which
he
dwelt
amid
the
churls
and
serfs
of
his
demesne
was
now
replaced
by
a
stone
tower
surrounded
by
a
moat
and
a
wall
the
wooden
homestead
with
its
thatched
roof
shaded
by
the
toft
of
ash
and
elm
and
maple
was
pulled
down
and
a
square
fortress
with
loopholes
and
battlement
stood
in
solitary
nakedness
upon
some
bleak
hill
ugly
and
defiant
there
with
a
band
of
armed
men
sometimes
with
a
wife
and
children
and
not
unfrequently
with
an
unhappy
victim
of
his
licentiousness
the
baron
lived
in
gloom
and
gluttony
till
the
love
of
excitement
the
approach
of
want
or
the
call
to
battle
drove
him
forth
his
passion
for
hunting
was
not
always
free
to
be
exercised
venison
was
not
everywhere
to
be
obtained
without
danger
even
to
the
powerful
and
lawless
but
within
a
ride
of
a
few
miles
there
was
generally
corn
in
the
barns
and
herds
were
in
the
pastures
the
petty
baron
was
almost
invariably
a
robber
sometimes
on
his
own
account
often
in
some
combined
adventure
of
plunder
the
spirit
of
rapine
always
too
prevalent
under
the
strongest
government
of
those
times
was
now
universal
when
the
government
was
fighting
for
its
own
existence
bands
of
marauders
sallied
forth
from
the
great
towns
especially
from
bristol
and
of
their
proceedings
the
author
of
the
speaks
with
the
precision
of
an
the
bristolians
under
the
instigation
of
the
earl
of
gloucester
were
partisans
of
the
matilda
and
wherever
the
king
or
his
adherents
had
estates
they
came
to
seize
their
oxen
and
sheep
and
carried
men
of
substance
into
bristol
as
captives
with
bandaged
eyes
and
bits
in
their
mouths
from
other
towns
as
well
as
bristol
came
forth
plunderers
with
humble
gait
and
courteous
discourse
who
when
they
met
with
a
lonely
man
having
the
appearance
of
being
wealthy
would
bear
him
off
to
starvation
and
torture
till
they
had
mulcted
him
to
the
last
farthing
these
and
other
indications
of
an
unsettled
government
took
place
before
the
landing
of
matilda
to
assert
her
claims
an
invasion
of
england
by
the
scottish
king
without
regard
to
the
previous
pacification
was
made
in
but
this
attempt
although
grounded
upon
the
oath
which
david
had
sworn
to
henry
was
regarded
by
the
northumbrians
as
a
national
hostility
which
demanded
a
national
resistance
the
course
of
this
invasion
has
been
minutely
described
by
contemporary
chroniclers
the
author
of
the
says
scotland
also
called
albany
is
a
country
overspread
by
extensive
moors
but
containing
flourishing
woods
and
pastures
which
feed
large
herds
of
cows
and
oxen
of
the
mountainous
regions
he
says
nothing
describing
the
natives
as
savage
swift
of
foot
and
lightly
armed
he
adds
a
confused
multitude
of
this
people
being
assembled
from
the
lowlands
of
scotland
they
were
formed
into
an
irregular
army
and
marched
for
england
from
the
period
of
the
conquest
a
large
number
of
had
been
settled
in
the
lowlands
and
the
border
countries
of
westmoreland
and
cumberland
were
also
occupied
to
a
considerable
extent
by
the
same
race
the
people
of
galloway
were
chiefly
of
the
original
british
stock
the
historians
describe
the
confused
multitude
as
exercising
great
cruelties
in
their
advance
through
the
country
that
lies
between
the
tweed
and
the
tees
and
matthew
paris
uses
a
significant
phrase
which
marks
how
completely
they
spread
over
the
land
he
calls
them
the
scottish
ants
the
archbishop
of
york
thurstan
an
aged
but
vigorous
man
collected
a
large
army
to
resist
the
invaders
and
he
made
a
politic
appeal
to
the
old
english
nationality
by
calling
out
the
population
under
the
banners
of
their
saxon
saints
the
bishop
of
durham
was
the
leader
of
this
army
composed
of
the
norman
chivalry
and
the
english
archers
the
opposing

gathered
round

tall
cross
raised
on
a

and
surrounded
by
the
banners
of
cuthbert
and
wilfred
and
john
of

from
this
incident
the
bloody
day
of
northallerton
was
called
the
battle
of
the
standard
hoveden
has
given
an
oration
made
by
ralph
bishop
of
durham
in
which
he
addresses
the
captains
as
brave
nobles
of
england
normans
by
birth
and
pointing
to
the
enemy
who
knew
not
the
use
of
armor
exclaims
your

is
covered
with
the
helmet
your
breast
with
a
coat
of
mail
your
legs
with
greaves
and
your
whole
body
with
the
shield
of
the
saxon
yeomanry
he
says
nothing
whether
the
oration
be
genuine
or
not
it
exhibits
the
mode
in
which
the
mass
of
the
people
were
regarded
at
that
time
thierry
appears
to
consider
that
the
bold
attempt
of
david
of
scotland
was
made
in
reliance
upon
the
support
of
the
race
but
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
they
bore
the
brunt
of
the
english
battle
and
whatever
might
be
their
wrongs
were
not
disposed
to
yield
their
fields
and
houses
to
a
fierce
multitude
who
came
for
spoil
and
for
possession
the
scotch
fought
with
darts
and
long
spears
and
attacked
the
solid
mass
of
normans
and
english
gathered
round
the
standard
prince
henry
the
son
of
the
king
of
scotland
made
a
vigorous
onslaught
with
a
body
of
horse
composed
of
english
and
normans
attached
to
his
father
household
these
were
without
doubt
especial
partisans
of
the
claim
to
the
english
crown
of
the
matilda
and
as
the
king
of
scotland
himself
is
described
were
inflamed
with
zeal
for
a
just
cause
the
issue
of
the
battle
was
the
signal
defeat
of
the
scottish
army
with
the
loss
of
eleven
thousand
men
upon
the
field
a
peace
was
concluded
with

given
a
picturesque
account
of
the

he
often
did
from
general
impressions
in
describing
the
gallant
charge

full
of

the
rapid

steady
growth
of
the

england
from
the
period
of

is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
characteristics
of
that

this
progress
we
must
steadily
keep
in

we
would
rightly
understand
the
general
condition
of
society
all
the
great
offices
of
the
church

scarcely
an
exception

question
with
his

prudence
whatever
difficulties
the

encountered
during
seventy
years

the
desire
to
raise
up
splendid
churches
in
the

of

dilapidated

buildings
was
a
passion
with
normans
whether

unscrupulous

of

erected
the

priory
of

in
his
capacity
of
bishop
but
he
raised
the
necessary
funds
with
his
usual
financial
vigor
he
took
the
revenues
of
the
canons
into
his
hands
and
put
the
canons
upon
a
short
allowance
till
the
work
was
completed
the
cistercian
order
of
monks
was
established
in
england
late
in
the
reign
of
henry

their
rule
was
one
of
the
most
severe
mortification
and
of
the
strictest
discipline
their
lives
were
spent
in
labor
and
in
prayer
and
their
one
frugal
daily
meal
was
eaten
in
silence
while
other
religious
orders
had
their
splendid
abbeys
amid
large
communities
the
cistercians
humbly
asked
grants
of
land
in
the
most
solitary
places
where
the
recluse
could
meditate
without

his
amid
desolate
moors

the

lost

here
he
derived
a
holy
comfort
in
seeing
the
monastic
buildings
rise
under
his
munificent
care
and
the
waste
lands
become
fertile
under
the
incessant
labors
of

to

the

speak
of
another
century
when
the
norman
architecture
like
the
norman
character
was
losing
its
distinctive
features
and
becoming
early
english
we
dwell
a
little
upon
these
norman
foundations
to
show
how
completely
the
church
was
spreading
itself
over
the
land
and
asserting
its
influence
in
places
where
man
had
seldom
trod
as
well
as
in
populous
towns
where
the
great
cathedral
was
crowded
with
earnest
votaries
and
the
lessons
of
peace
were
proclaimed
amid
the
distractions
of
unsettled
government
and
the
oppressions
of
lordly
despotism
whatever
was
the
misery
of
the
country

ordinary

still
bound
the
people
to
the
universal
christian
church
whether
the

or

dipped
in
the
great

the
children
of

had
been
dipped
in
the
ruder
saxon
the
same
latin
office
unintelligible
in
words
but
significant
in
its
import
was
said
and
sung
when
the
bride
stood
at
the
altar
and
the
father
was
laid
in
his
grave
the
vernacular
tongue
gradually
melted
into
one
dialect
and
the
penitent
and
the
confessor
were
the
first
to
lay
aside
the
great
distinction
of
race
and
country
that
of
language
the
norman
prelates
were
men
of
learning
and
ability
of
taste
and
magnificence
and
whatever
might
have
been
the
luxury
and
even
vices
of
some
among
them
the
vast
revenues
of
the
great
sees
were
not
wholly
devoted
to
worldly
pomp
but
were
applied
to
noble
uses
after
the
lapse
of
seven
centuries
we
still
tread
with
reverence
those
portions
of
our
cathedrals
in
which
the
early
norman
architecture
is
manifest
there
is
no
english
cathedral
in
which
we
are
so
completely
impressed
with
the
massive
grandeur
of
the
style
as
by
durham
durham
cathedral
was
commenced
in
the
middle
of
the
reign
of
rufus
and
the
building
went
on
through
the
reign
of
henry
canterbury
was
commenced
by
archbishop
lanfranc
soon
after
the
conquest
and
was
enlarged
and
altered
in
various
details
till
it
was
burned
in
some
portions
of
the
original
building
remain
rochester
was
commenced
eleven
years
after
the
conquest
and
its
present
nave
is
an
unaltered
part
of
the
original
building
chichester
has
nearly
the
same
date
of
its
commencement
and
the
building
of
this
church
was
continued
till
its
dedication
in
norwich
was
founded
in
and
its
erection
was
carried
forward
so
rapidly
that
in
seven
years
there
were
sixty
monks
here
located
winchester
is
one
of
the
earliest
of
these
noble
cathedrals
but
its
norman
feature
of
the
round
arch
is
not
the
general
characteristic
of
the
edifice
the
original
piers
having
been
recased
in
the
pointed
style
in
the
reign
of
edward
iii
the
dates
of
these
buildings
so
grand
in
their
conception
so
solid
in
their
execution
would
be
sufficient
of
themselves
to
show
the
wealth
and
activity
of
the
church
during
the
reigns
of
the
conqueror
and
his
sons
but
during
this
period
of
seventy
years
and
in
part
of
the
reign
of
stephen
the
erection
of
monastic
buildings
was
universal
in
england
as
in
continental
europe
the
crusades
gave
a
most
powerful
impulse
to
the
religious
fervor
in
the
enthusiasm
of
chivalry
which
covered
many
of
its
enormities
with
outward
acts
of
piety
vows
were
frequently
made
by
wealthy
nobles
that
they
would
depart
for
the
holy
wars
but
sometimes
the
vow
was
inconvenient
the
lady
of
the
castle
wept
at
the
almost
certain
perils
of
her
lord
and
his
projects
of
ambition
often
kept
the
lord
at
home
to
look
after
his
own
especial
interests
then
the
vow
to
wear
the
cross
might
be
commuted
by
the
foundation
of
a
religious
house
repentance
for
crimes
of
violence
and
a
licentious
life
increased
the
number
of
these
endowments
it
has
been
computed
that
three
hundred
monastic
establishments
were
founded
in
england
during
the
reigns
of
henry
i
stephen
and
henry
ii
we
have
briefly
stated
these
few
general
facts
regarding
the
outward
manifestation
of
the
power
and
the
wealth
of
the
church
at
this
period
to
show
how
important
an
influence
it
must
have
exercised
upon
all
questions
of
government
but
its
organization
was
of
far
greater
importance
than
the
aggregate
wealth
of
the
sees
and
abbeys
the
english
church
during
the
troubled
reign
of
stephen
had
become
more
completely
under
the
papal
dominion
than
at
any
previous
period
of
its
history
the
king
attempted
rashly
perhaps
but
honestly
to
interpose
some
check
to
the
ecclesiastical
desire
for
supremacy
but
from
the
hour
when
he
entered
into
a
contest
with
bishops
and
synods
his
reign
became
one
of
kingly
trouble
and
national
misery
the
norman
bishops
not
only
combined
in
their
own
persons
the
functions
of
the
priest
and
of
the
lawyer
but
were
often
military
leaders
as
barons
they
had
to
perform
and
this
condition
of
their
tenures
naturally
surrounded
them
with
armed
retainers
that
this
anomalous
position
should
have
corrupted
the
ambitious
churchman
into
a
proud
and
luxurious
lord
was
almost
inevitable
the
authority
of
the
crown
might
have
been
strong
enough
to
repress
the
individual
discontent
or
to
punish
the
individual
treason
of
these
great
prelates
but
every
one
of
them
was
doubly
formidable
as
a
member
of
a
confederacy
over
which
a
foreign
head
claimed
to
preside
there
were
three
bishops
whose
intrigues
king
stephen
had
especially
to
dread
at
the
time
when
an
open
war
for
the
succession
of
matilda
was
on
the
point
of
bursting
forth
roger
the
bishop
of
salisbury
had
been
promoted
from
the
condition
of
a
parish
priest
at
caen
to
be
chaplain
secretary
chancellor
and
chief
justiciary
of
henry
i
he
was
instrumental
in
the
election
of
stephen
to
the
throne
and
he
was
rewarded
with
extravagant
gifts
as
he
had
been
previously
rewarded
by
henry
stephen
appears
to
have
fostered
his
rapacity
in
the
conviction
that
his
pride
would
have
a
speedier
fall
the
king
often
saying
i
would
give
him
half
england
if
he
asked
for
it
till
the
time
be
ripe
he
shall
tire
of
asking
ere
i
tire
of
giving
the
time
was
ripe
in
the
bishop
had
erected
castles
at
devizes
at
sherborne
and
at
malmesbury
king
henry
had
given
him
the
castle
of
salisbury
this
lord
of
four
castles
had
powerful
auxiliaries
in
his
nephews
the
bishop
of
lincoln
and
the
bishop
of
ely
alexander
of
lincoln
had
built
the
castles
of
newark
and
sleaford
and
was
almost
as
powerful
as
his
uncle
in
july
a
great
council
was
held
at
oxford
and
thither
came
these
three
bishops
with
military
and
secular
pomp
and
with
an
escort
that
became
the
wonder
of
all
beholders
a
quarrel
ensued
between
the
retainers
of
the
bishops
and
those
of
alain
earl
of
brittany
about
a
right
to
quarters
and
the
quarrel
went
on
to
a
battle
in
which
men
were
slain
on
both
sides
the
bishops
of
salisbury
and
lincoln
were
arrested
as
breakers
of
the
king
peace
the
bishop
of
ely
fled
to
his
uncle
castle
of
devizes
the
king
under
the
advice
of
the
sagacious
earl
millent
resolved
to
dispossess
these
dangerous
prelates
of
their
fortresses
which
were
all
finally
surrendered
the
bishops
humbled
and
mortified
and
stripped
of
all
pomp
and
vainglory
were
reduced
to
a
simple
ecclesiastical
life
and
to
the
possessions
belonging
to
them
as
churchmen
the
contemporary
who
writes
this
the
author
of
the
although
a
decided
partisan
of
stephen
speaks
of
this
event
as
the
result
of
mad
counsels
and
a
grievous
sin
that
resembled
the
wickedness
of
the
sons
of
korah
and
of
saul
the
great
body
of
the
ecclesiastics
were
indignant
at
what
they
considered
an
offence
to
their
order
the
bishop
of
winchester
the
brother
of
stephen
had
become
the
pope
legate
in
england
and
he
summoned
the
king
to
attend
a
synod
at
winchester
he
there
produced
his
authority
as
legate
from
pope
innocent
and
denounced
the
arrest
of
the
bishops
as
a
dreadful
crime
the
king
had
refused
to
attend
the
council
but
he
sent
alberic
de
vere
a
man
deeply
versed
in
legal
affairs
to
represent
him
this
advocate
urged
that
the
bishop
of
lincoln
was
the
author
of
the
tumult
at
oxford
that
whenever
bishop
roger
came
to
court
his
people
presuming
on
his
power
excited
tumults
that
the
bishop
secretly
favored
the
enemies
and
was
ready
to
join
the
party
of
the
empress
the
council
was
adjourned
but
on
a
subsequent
day
came
the
archbishop
of
rouen
as
the
champion
of
the
king
and
contended
that
it
was
against
the
canons
that
the
bishops
should
possess
castles
and
that
even
if
they
had
the
right
they
were
bound
to
deliver
them
up
to
the
will
of
the
king
as
the
times
were
eventful
and
the
king
was
bound
to
make
war
for
the
common
security
the
archbishop
of
rouen
reasoned
as
a
statesman
the
bishop
of
winchester
as
the
pope
legate
some
of
the
bishops
threatened
to
proceed
to
rome
and
the
king
advocate
intimated
that
if
they
did
so
their
return
might
not
be
so
easy
swords
were
at
last
unsheathed
the
king
and
the
earls
were
now
in
open
hostility
with
the
legate
and
the
bishops
excommunication
of
the
king
was
hinted
at
but
persuasion
was
resorted
to
stephen
according
to
one
authority
made
humble
submission
and
thus
abated
the
rigor
of
ecclesiastical
discipline
if
he
did
submit
his
submission
was
too
late
within
a
month
earl
robert
and
the
empress
matilda
were
in
england
matilda
and
the
earl
of
gloucester
landed
at
arundel
where
the
widow
of
henry
i
was
dwelling
they
had
a
very
small
force
to
support
their
pretensions
the
earl
crossed
the
country
to
bristol
all
england
was
struck
with
alarm
and
men
minds
were
agitated
in
various
ways
those
who
secretly
or
openly
favored
the
invaders
were
roused
to
more
than
usual
activity
against
the
king
while
his
own
partisans
were
terrified
as
if
a
thunderbolt
had
fallen
stephen
invested
the
castle
of
arundel
but
in
the
most
romantic
spirit
of
chivalry
he
permitted
the
empress
to
pass
out
and
to
set
forward
to
join
her
brother
at
bristol
under
a
in
the
whole
kingdom
appears
to
have
been
subjected
to
the
horrors
of
a
partisan
warfare
the
barons
in
their
castles
were
making
a
show
of
defending
their
neighborhoods
but
more
properly
to
speak
were
laying
them
waste
the
legate
and
the
bishops
were
excommunicating
the
plunderers
of
churches
but
the
plunderers
laughed
at
their
anathemas
freebooters
came
over
from
flanders
not
to
practise
the
industrial
arts
as
in
the
time
of
henry
i
but
to
take
their
part
in
the
general
pillage
there
was
frightful
scarcity
in
the
country
and
the
ordinary
interchange
of
man
with
man
was
unsettled
by
the
debasement
of
the
coin
all
things
says
malmesbury
became
venial
in
england
and
churches
and
abbeys
were
no
longer
secretly
but
even
publicly
exposed
to
sale
all
things
become
venial
under
a
government
too
weak
to
repress
plunder
or
to
punish
corruption
the
strong
aim
to
be
rich
by
rapine
and
the
cunning
by
fraud
when
the
confusion
of
a
kingdom
is
grown
so
great
that
as
is
recorded
of
this
period
the
neighbor
could
put
no
faith
in
his
nearest
neighbor
nor
the
friend
in
his
friend
nor
the
brother
in
his
own
brother
the
demoralization
of
anarchy
is
even
more
terrible
than
its
bloodshed
the
marches
and
sieges
the
revolts
and
treacheries
of
this
evil
time
are
occasionally
varied
by
incidents
which
illustrate
the
state
of
society
robert
with
a
detachment
of
the
earl
of
gloucester
soldiers
surprised
the
castle
of
devizes
which
the
king
had
taken
from
the
bishop
of
salisbury
robert
varies
the
atrocities
of
his
by
rubbing
his
prisoners
with
honey
and
exposing
them
naked
to
the
sun
but
robert
having
obtained
devizes
refused
to
admit
the
earl
of
gloucester
to
any
advantage
of
its
possession
and
commenced
the
subjection
of
the
neighborhood
on
his
own
account
another
crafty
baron
john
held
the
castle
of
marlborough
and
robert
having
an
anxious
desire
to
be
lord
of
that
castle
also
endeavoring
to
cajole
into
the
admission
of
his
followers
went
there
as
a
guest
but
was
detained
as
a
prisoner
upon
this
the
earl
of
gloucester
came
in
force
for
revenge
against
his
treacherous
ally
and
conducting
him
to
devizes
there
hanged
him
the
surprise
of
lincoln
castle
upon
which
the
events
of
mainly
turned
is
equally
characteristic
of
the
age
ranulf
earl
of
chester
and
william
de
roumare
his
were
avowed
friends
of
king
stephen
but
their
ambition
took
a
new
direction
for
the
support
of
matilda
the
garrison
of
lincoln
had
no
apprehension
of
a
surprise
and
were
busy
in
those
sports
which
hardy
men
enjoy
even
amid
the
rougher
sport
of
war
the
countess
of
chester
and
her
with
a
politeness
that
the
ladies
of
the
court
of
louis
le
grand
could
not
excel
paid
a
visit
to
the
wife
of
the
knight
who
had
the
defence
of
the
castle
while
there
at
this
pleasant
morning
call
talking
and
joking
with
the
unsuspecting
matron
as
ordericus
relates
the
earl
of
chester
came
in
without
his
armor
or
even
his
mantle
attended
only
by
three
soldiers
his
courtesy
was
as
flattering
as
that
of
his
countess
and
her
friend
but
his
suddenly
mastered
the
unprepared
guards
and
the
gates
were
thrown
open
to
earl
william
and
his
numerous
followers
the
earls
after
this
stratagem
held
the
castle
against
the
king
who
speedily
marched
to
lincoln
but
the
earl
of
chester
contrived
to
leave
the
castle
and
soon
raised
a
powerful
army
of
his
own
vassals
the
earl
of
gloucester
joined
him
with
a
considerable
force
and
they
together
advanced
to
the
relief
of
the
besieged
city
the
battle
of
lincoln
was
preceded
by
a
trifling
incident
to
which
the
chroniclers
have
attached
importance
it
was
the
feast
of
the
purification
and
at
the
mass
which
was
celebrated
at
the
dawn
of
day
when
the
king
was
holding
a
lighted
taper
in
his
hand
it
was
suddenly
extinguished
this
was
an
omen
of
sorrow
to
the
king
says
hoveden
but
another
chronicler
the
author
of
the
tells
us
in
addition
that
the
wax
candle
was
suddenly
relighted
and
he
accordingly
argues
that
this
incident
was
a
token
that
for
his
sins
he
should
be
deprived
of
his
crown
but
on
his
repentance
through
mercy
he
should
wonderfully
and
gloriously
recover
it
the
king
had
been
more
than
a
month
laying
siege
to
the
castle
and
his
army
was
encamped
around
the
city
of
lincoln
when
it
was
ascertained
that
his
enemies
were
at
hand
he
was
advised
to
raise
the
siege
and
march
out
to
strengthen
his
power
by
a
general
levy
he
decided
upon
instant
battle
he
was
then
exhorted
not
to
fight
on
the
solemn
festival
of
the
purification
but
his
courage
was
greater
than
his
prudence
or
his
piety
he
set
forth
to
meet
the
insurgent
earls
the
best
knights
were
in
his
army
but
the
infantry
of
his
rivals
was
far
more
numerous
stephen
detached
a
strong
body
of
horse
and
foot
to
dispute
the
passage
of
a
ford
of
the
trent
but
gloucester
by
an
impetuous
charge
obtained
possession
of
the
ford
and
the
battle
became
general
the
horsemen
fled
the
desperate
bravery
of
stephen
and
the
issue
of
the
battle
have
been
described
by
henry
of
huntingdon
with
singular
animation
king
stephen
therefore
with
his
infantry
stood
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
enemy
these
surrounded
the
royal
troops
attacking
the
columns
on
all
sides
as
if
they
were
assaulting
a
castle
then
the
battle
raged
terribly
round
this
circle
helmets
and
swords
gleamed
as
they
clashed
and
the
fearful
cries
and
shouts
reëchoed
from
the
neighboring
hills
and
city
walls
the
cavalry
furiously
charging
the
royal
column
slew
some
and
trampled
down
others
some
were
made
prisoners
no
respite
no
breathing
time
was
allowed
except
in
the
quarter
in
which
the
king
himself
had
taken
his
stand
where
the
assailants
recoiled
from
the
unmatched
force
of
his
terrible
arm
the
earl
of
chester
seeing
this
and
envious
of
the
glory
the
king
was
gaining
threw
himself
upon
him
with
the
whole
weight
of
his
even
then
the
king
courage
did
not
fail
but
his
heavy
gleamed
like
lightning
striking
down
some
bearing
back
others
at
length
it
was
shattered
by
repeated
blows
then
he
drew
his
sword
with
which
he
wrought
wonders
until
that
too
was
broken
perceiving
which
william
de
kaims
a
brave
soldier
rushed
on
him
and
seizing
him
by
his
helmet
shouted
here
i
have
taken
the
king
others
came
to
his
aid
and
the
king
was
made
prisoner
after
the
capture
of
king
stephen
at
this
brief
but
decisive
battle
he
was
kept
a
close
prisoner
at
bristol
castle
then
commenced
what
might
be
called
the
reign
of
queen
matilda
which
lasted
about
eight
months
the
defeat
of
stephen
was
the
triumph
of
the
greater
ecclesiastics
on
the
third
sunday
in
lent
there
was
a
conference
on
the
plain
in
the
neighborhood
of
winchester
a
day
dark
and
rainy
which
portended
disasters
the
bishop
of
winchester
came
forth
from
his
city
with
all
the
pomp
of
the
pope
legate
and
there
matilda
swore
that
in
all
matters
of
importance
and
especially
in
the
bestowal
of
bishoprics
and
abbeys
she
would
submit
to
the
church
and
the
bishop
and
his
supporters
pledged
their
faith
to
the
empress
on
these
conditions
after
easter
a
great
council
was
held
at
winchester
which
the
bishop
called
as
the
pope
vicegerent
the
unscrupulous
churchman
boldly
came
forward
and
denounced
his
brother
inviting
the
assembly
to
elect
a
sovereign
and
with
an
amount
of
arrogance
totally
unprecedented
thus
asserted
the
notorious
untruth
that
the
right
of
electing
a
king
of
england
principally
belonged
to
the
clergy
the
case
was
yesterday
agitated
before
a
part
of
the
higher
clergy
of
england
to
whose
right
it
principally
pertains
to
elect
the
sovereign
and
also
to
crown
him
first
then
as
is
fitting
invoking
god
assistance
we
elect
the
daughter
of
that
peaceful
that
glorious
that
rich
that
good
and
in
our
times
incomparable
king
as
sovereign
of
england
and
normandy
and
promise
her
fidelity
and
support
the
bishop
then
said
to
the
applauding
assembly
we
have
despatched
messengers
for
the
londoners
who
from
the
importance
of
their
city
in
england
are
almost
nobles
as
it
were
to
meet
us
on
this
business
the
next
day
the
londoners
came
they
were
sent
they
said
by
their
fraternity
to
entreat
that
their
lord
the
king
might
be
liberated
from
captivity
the
legate
refused
them
and
repeated
his
oration
against
his
brother
it
was
a
work
of
great
difficulty
to
soothe
the
minds
of
the
londoners
and
day
had
arrived
before
they
would
consent
to
acknowledge
matilda
many
parts
of
the
kingdom
had
then
submitted
to
her
government
and
she
entered
london
with
great
state
her
nature
seems
to
have
been
rash
and
imperious
her
first
act
was
to
demand
subsidies
of
the
citizens
and
when
they
said
that
their
wealth
was
greatly
diminished
by
the
troubled
state
of
the
kingdom
she
broke
forth
into
insufferable
rage
the
vigilant
queen
of
stephen
who
kept
possession
of
kent
now
approached
the
city
with
a
numerous
force
and
by
her
envoys
demanded
her
freedom
of
course
her
demand
was
made
in
vain
she
then
put
forth
a
front
of
battle
instead
of
being
crowned
at
westminster
the
daughter
of
henry
i
fled
in
terror
for
the
whole
city
flew
to
arms
at
the
ringing
of
the
bells
which
was
the
signal
for
war
and
all
with
one
accord
rose
upon
the
countess
of
anjou
and
her
adherents
as
swarms
of
wasps
issue
from
their
hives
william
fitzstephen
the
biographer
of
thomas
à
becket
in
his
of
supposed
to
be
written
about
the
middle
of
the
reign
of
henry
ii
says
of
this
city
ennobled
by
her
men
graced
by
her
arms
and
peopled
by
a
multitude
of
inhabitants
that
in
the
wars
under
king
stephen
there
went
out
to
a
muster
of
armed
horsemen
esteemed
fit
for
war
twenty
thousand
and
of
infantry
sixty
thousand
in
general
the
of
appears
trustworthy
and
in
some
instances
is
supported
by
other
authorities
but
this
vast
number
of
fighting
men
must
unquestionably
be
exaggerated
unless
as
lyttelton
conjectures
such
a
muster
included
the
militia
of
middlesex
kent
and
other
counties
adjacent
to
london
peter
of
blois
in
the
reign
of
henry
ii
reckons
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
at
forty
thousand
that
the
citizens
were
trained
to
warlike
exercises
and
that
their
manly
sports
nurtured
them
in
the
hardihood
of
military
habits
we
may
well
conclude
from
fitzstephen
account
of
this
community
at
a
little
later
period
than
that
of
which
we
are
writing
to
the
north
of
the
city
were
pasture
lands
with
streams
on
whose
banks
the
clack
of
many
mills
was
pleasing
to
the
ear
and
beyond
was
an
immense
forest
with
densely
wooded
thickets
where
stags
boars
and
wild
bulls
had
their
coverts
we
have
seen
that
in
the
charter
of
henry
i
the
citizens
had
liberty
to
hunt
through
a
very
extensive
district
and
hawking
was
also
among
their
free
recreations
football
was
the
favorite
game
and
the
boys
of
the
schools
and
the
various
guilds
of
craftsmen
had
each
their
ball
the
elder
citizens
came
on
horseback
to
see
these
contests
of
the
young
men
every
sunday
in
lent
a
company
with
lances
and
shields
went
out
to
joust
in
the
easter
holidays
they
had
river
tournaments
during
the
summer
the
youths
exercised
themselves
in
leaping
archery
wrestling
slinging
javelins
and
fighting
with
bucklers
when
the
great
marsh
which
washed
the
walls
of
the
city
on
the
north
was
frozen
over
sliding
sledging
and
skating
were
the
sports
of
crowds
they
had
sham
fights
on
the
ice
and
legs
and
arms
were
sometimes
broken
but
says
fitzstephen
youth
is
an
age
eager
for
glory
and
desirous
of
victory
and
so
young
men
engage
in
counterfeit
battles
that
they
may
conduct
themselves
more
valiantly
in
real
ones
that
universal
love
of
hardy
sports
which
is
one
of
the
greatest
characteristics
of
england
and
from
which
we
derive
no
little
of
that
spirit
which
keeps
our
island
safe
is
not
of
modern
growth
it
was
one
of
the
most
important
portions
of
the
education
of
the
people
seven
centuries
ago
it
was
this
community
then
so
brave
so
energetic
so
enriched
by
commerce
above
all
the
other
cities
of
england
that
resolutely
abided
by
the
fortunes
of
king
stephen
they
had
little
to
dread
from
any
hostile
assaults
of
the
rival
faction
for
the
city
was
strongly
fortified
on
all
sides
except
to
the
river
but
on
that
side
it
was
secure
after
the
tower
was
built
the
palace
of
westminster
had
also
a
breastwork
and
bastions
after
matilda
had
taken
her
hasty
departure
the
indignant
londoners
marched
out
and
they
sustained
a
principal
part
in
what
has
been
called
the
rout
of
winchester
in
which
robert
earl
of
gloucester
was
taken
prisoner
the
escaped
to
devizes
the
capture
of
the
earl
of
gloucester
led
to
important
results
a
convention
was
agreed
to
between
the
adherents
of
each
party
that
the
king
should
be
exchanged
for
the
earl
stephen
was
once
more
every
inch
a
king
but
still
there
was
no
peace
in
the
land
the
bishop
of
winchester
had
again
changed
his
side
in
the
hour
of
success
the
empress
matilda
had
refused
the
reasonable
request
that
prince
eustace
the
son
of
stephen
should
be
put
in
possession
of
his
father
earldom
of
boulogne
malmesbury
says
a
misunderstanding
arose
between
the
legate
and
the
empress
which
may
be
justly
considered
as
the
melancholy
cause
of
every
subsequent
evil
in
england
the
chief
actors
in
this
extraordinary
drama
present
a
curious
study
of
human
character
matilda
resting
her
claim
to
the
throne
upon
her
legitimate
descent
from
henry
i
who
had
himself
usurped
the
throne
possessing
her
father
courage
and
daring
with
some
of
his
cruelty
haughty
vindictive
furnishes
one
of
the
most
striking
portraits
of
the
proud
lady
of
the
feudal
period
who
shrank
from
no
danger
by
reason
of
her
sex
but
made
the
homage
of
chivalry
to
woman
a
powerful
instrument
for
enforcing
her
absolute
will
the
earl
of
gloucester
the
illegitimate
brother
of
matilda
brave
steadfast
of
a
free
and
generous
nature
a
sagacious
counsellor
a
lover
of
literature
appears
to
have
had
few
of
the
vices
of
that
age
and
most
of
its
elevating
qualities
of
stephen
it
has
been
said
he
deserves
no
other
reproach
than
that
of
having
embraced
the
occupation
of
a
captain
of
banditti
this
appears
rather
a
harsh
judgment
from
a
philosophical
writer
bearing
in
mind
that
the
principle
of
election
prevailed
in
the
choice
of
a
king
whatever
was
the
hereditary
claim
and
seeing
how
welcome
was
the
advent
of
stephen
when
he
came
in
to
avert
the
dangers
of
the
kingdom
he
merits
the
title
of
a
captain
of
banditti
no
more
than
harold
or
william
the
conqueror
after
the
contests
of
six
years
the
victories
the
defeats
the
hostility
of
the
church
his
capture
and
imprisonment
the
attachment
of
the
people
of
the
great
towns
to
his
person
and
government
appears
to
have
been
unshaken
when
he
was
defeated
at
lincoln
and
led
captive
through
the
city
the
surrounding
multitude
were
moved
with
pity
shedding
tears
and
uttering
cries
of
grief
ordericus
says
the
king
disaster
filled
with
grief
the
clergy
and
monks
and
the
common
people
because
he
was
condescending
and
courteous
to
those
who
were
good
and
quiet
and
if
his
treacherous
nobles
had
allowed
it
he
would
have
put
an
end
to
their
rapacious
enterprises
and
been
a
generous
protector
and
benevolent
friend
of
the
country
the
fourth
and
not
least
remarkable
personage
of
this
history
is
henry
the
bishop
of
winchester
and
the
pope
legate
at
that
period
when
the
functions
of
churchman
and
statesman
were
united
we
find
this
man
the
chief
instrument
for
securing
the
crown
for
his
brother
he
subsequently
becomes
the
vicegerent
of
the
papal
see
stephen
with
more
justice
than
discretion
is
of
opinion
that
bishops
are
not
doing
their
duty
when
they
build
castles
ride
about
in
armor
with
crowds
of
retainers
and
are
not
at
all
scrupulous
in
appropriating
some
of
the
booty
of
a
lawless
time
from
the
day
when
he
exhibited
his
hostility
to
fighting
bishops
the
pope
legate
was
his
brother
deadly
enemy
but
he
found
that
the
rival
whom
he
had
set
up
was
by
no
means
a
pliant
tool
in
his
hands
and
he
then
turned
against
matilda
when
stephen
had
shaken
off
the
chains
with
which
he
was
loaded
in
bristol
castle
the
bishop
summoned
a
council
at
westminster
on
his
legatine
authority
and
there
by
great
powers
of
eloquence
endeavored
to
extenuate
the
odium
of
his
own
conduct
affirming
that
he
had
supported
the
empress
not
from
inclination
but
necessity
he
then
commanded
on
the
part
of
god
and
of
the
pope
that
they
should
strenuously
assist
the
king
appointed
by
the
will
of
the
people
and
by
the
approbation
of
the
holy
see
malmesbury
who
records
these
doings
adds
that
a
layman
sent
from
the
empress
affirmed
that
her
coming
to
england
had
been
effected
by
the
legate
frequent
letters
and
that
her
taking
the
king
and
holding
him
in
captivity
had
been
done
principally
by
his
connivance
the
reign
of
stephen
is
not
only
the
most
perfect
condensation
of
all
the
ills
of
feudality
but
affords
a
striking
picture
of
the
ills
which
befall
a
people
when
an
ambitious
hierarchy
swayed
to
and
fro
at
the
will
of
a
foreign
power
regards
the
supremacy
of
the
church
as
the
one
great
object
to
be
attained
at
whatever
expense
of
treachery
and
falsehood
of
national
degradation
and
general
suffering
in
the
civil
war
is
raging
more
fiercely
than
ever
matilda
is
at
oxford
a
fortified
city

by

thames
by

the

with
a
deep
snow
the

and
the
tributary
rivers
are
frozen
over
with
a
small
escort
matilda
contrives
to
escape
and
passes
undiscovered
through
the
royal
posts
on
a
dark
and
silent
night
when
no
sound
is
heard
but
the
clang
of
a
trumpet
or
the
challenge
of
a
sentinel
in
the
course
of
the
night
she
went
to
abingdon
on
foot
and
afterwards
reached
wallingford
on

the
author
of

expresses
his
wonder
at
the
marvellous
escapes
of
this
courageous
woman
the
changes
of
her
fortune
are
equally
remarkable
after
the
flight
from
oxford
the
arms
of
the
earl
of
gloucester
are
again
successful
stephen
is
beaten
at
wilton
and
retreats
precipitately
with
his
military
brother
the
bishop
of
winchester
there
are
now
in
the
autumn
of
universal
turmoil
and
desolation
many
people
emigrate
others
crowd
round
the
sanctuary
of
the
churches
and
dwell
there
in
mean
hovels
famine
is
general
fields
are
white
with
ripened
corn
but
the
cultivators
have
fled
and
there
is
none
to
gather
the
harvest
cities
are
deserted
and
depopulated
fierce
foreign
mercenaries
for
whom
the
barons
have
no
pay
pillage
the
farms
and
the
monasteries
the
bishops
for
the
most
part
rest
supine
amid
all
this
storm
of
tyranny
when
they
rouse
themselves
they
increase
rather
than
mitigate
the
miseries
of
the
people
milo
earl
of
hereford
has
demanded
money
of
the
bishop
of
hereford
to
pay
his
troops
the
bishop
refuses
and
milo
seizes
his
lands
and
goods
the
bishop
then
pronounces
sentence
of
excommunication
against
milo
and
his
adherents
and
lays
an
interdict
upon
the
country
subject
to
the
earl
authority
we
might
hastily
think
that
the
solemn
curse
pronounced
against
a
nation
or
a
district
was
an
unmeaning
ceremony
with
its
bell
book
and
candle
to
terrify
only
the
weakminded
it
was
one
of
the
most
outrageous
of
the
numerous
ecclesiastical
tyrannies
the
consolations
of
religion
were
eagerly
sought
for
and
justly
prized
by
the
great
body
of
the
people
who
earnestly
believed
that
a
happy
future
would
be
a
reward
for
the
patient
endurance
of
a
miserable
present
as
they
were
admitted
to
the
holy
communion
they
recognized
an
acknowledgment
of
the
equality
of
men
before
the
great
father
of
all
their
marriages
were
blessed
and
their
funerals
were
hallowed
under
an
interdict
all
the
churches
were
shut
no
knell
was
tolled
for
the
dead
for
the
dead
remained
unburied
no
merry
peals
welcomed
the
bridal
procession
for
no
couple
could
be
joined
in
wedlock
the
mother
might
have
her
infant
baptized
and
the
dying
might
receive
extreme
unction
but
all
public
offices
of
the
church
were
suspended
if
we
imagine
such
a
condition
of
society
in
a
village
devastated
by
fire
and
sword
we
may
wonder
how
a
free
government
and
a
christian
church
have
ever
grown
up
among
us
if
stephen
had
quietly
possessed
the
throne
and
his
heir
had
succeeded
him
the
crowns
of
england
and
normandy
would
have
been
disconnected
before
the
thirteenth
century
geoffrey
of
anjou
while
his
duchess
was
in
england
had
become
master
of
normandy
and
its
nobles
had
acknowledged
his
son
henry
as
their
rightful
duke
the
boy
was
in
england
under
the
protection
of
the
earl
of
gloucester
who
attended
to
his
education
the
great
earl
died
in
for
a
few
years
there
had
been
no
decided
contest
between
the
forces
of
the
king
and
the
empress
after
eight
years
of
terrible
hostility
and
of
desperate
adventure
matilda
left
the
country
stephen
made
many
efforts
to
control
the
license
of
the
barons
but
with
little
effect
he
was
now
engaged
in
another
quarrel
with
the
church
his
brother
had
been
superseded
as
legate
by
theobald
archbishop
of
canterbury
in
consequence
of
the
death
of
the
pope
who
had
supported
the
bishop
of
winchester
theobald
was
stephen
enemy
and
his
hostility
was
rendered
formidable
by
his
alliance
with
bigod
the
earl
of
norfolk
the
archbishop
excommunicated
stephen
and
his
adherents
and
the
king
was
enforced
to
submission
in
stephen
having
been
again
reconciled
to
the
church
sought
the
recognition
of
his
son
eustace
as
the
heir
to
the
kingdom
this
recognition
was
absolutely
refused
by
the
archbishop
who
said
that
stephen
was
regarded
by
the
papal
see
as
an
usurper
but
time
was
preparing
a
solution
of
the
difficulties
of
the
kingdom
henry
of
anjou
was
grown
into
manhood
born
in
he
had
been
knighted
by
his
uncle
david
of
scotland
in
his
father
died
in
and
he
became
not
only
duke
of
normandy
but
earl
of
anjou
touraine
and
maine
in
he
contracted
a
marriage
of
ambition
with
eleanor
the
divorced
wife
of
louis
of
france
and
thus
became
lord
of
aquitaine
and
poitou
which
eleanor
possessed
in
her
own
right
master
of
all
the
western
coast
of
france
from
the
somme
to
the
pyrenees
with
the
exception
of
brittany
his
ambition
thus
strengthened
by
his
power
prepared
to
dispute
the
sovereignty
of
england
with
better
hopes
than
ever
waited
on
his
mother
career
he
landed
with
a
band
of
followers
in
and
besieged
various
castles
but
no
general
encounter
took
place
the
king
and
the
duke
had
a
conference
without
witnesses
across
a
rivulet
and
this
meeting
prepared
the
way
for
a
final
pacification
the
negotiators
were
henry
the
bishop
on
the
one
part
and
theobald
the
archbishop
on
the
other
finally
stephen
led
the
prince
in
solemn
procession
through
the
streets
of
winchester
and
all
the
great
men
of
the
realm
by
the
king
command
did
homage
and
pronounced
the
fealty
due
to
their
liege
lord
to
the

of

saving
only
their
allegiance
to

and
life
then
prevalent
among
ecclesiastics
and
monks
his
own
life
was
sternly
simple
and
ascetic
and
this
habit
had
been
strongly
confirmed
by
the
ethical
passion
which
burned
in
the
religious
and
philosophical
instructions
of
abelard
with
the
popular
religion
arnold
had
earnest
sympathy
but
he
would
reduce
the
clergy
to
their
primitive
and
apostolic
poverty
depriving
them
of
individual
wealth
and
of
all
temporal
power
the
inspiring
idea
of
arnold
movement
was
that
of
a
holy
and
pure
church
a
renovation
of
the
spiritual
order
after
the
pattern
of
the
apostolic
church
he
conformed
in
dress
as
well
as
in
his
mode
of
life
to
the
principles
he
taught
the
worldly
and
often
corrupt
clergy
he
maintained
were
unfit
to
discharge
the
priestly
functions
they
were
no
longer
priests
and
the
secularized
church
was
no
longer
the
house
of
god
arnold
dreamed
of
a
great
christian
republic
and
labored
to
establish
it
insomuch
that
his
ideal
never
realized
in
concrete
form
either
in
church
or
state
took
and
in
history
has
kept
the
name
of
republic
his
eloquence
and
sincerity
brought
him
powerful
popular
support
and
even
a
large
part
of
the
nobility
were
won
to
his
side
but
of
course
among
those
whom
his
aims
condemned
or
antagonized
there
were
many
who
spared
no
pains
to
place
him
in
an
unfavorable
light
and
to
bring
his
labors
to
naught
in
the
simple
story
of
his
career
as
here
told
by
the
great
church
historian
his
figure
appears
in
an
attitude
of
heroism
which
the
pathos
of
his
end
can
only
make
the
reader
more
deeply
appreciate
through
all
this
agitation
is
heard
the
voice
of
bernard
urging
the
religious
conscience
and
better
aspiration
of
the
time
preaching
the
second
crusade
and
speeding
its
eastward
march
with
earnest
expectation
his
high
hope
doomed
to
perish
with
its
inglorious
result
arnold
discourses
were
directly
calculated
by
their
tendency
to
find
ready
entrance
into
the
minds
of
the
laity
before
whose
eyes
the
worldly
lives
of
the
ecclesiastics
and
monks
were
constantly
present
and
to
create
a
faction
in
deadly
hostility
to
the
clergy
superadded
to
this
was
the
inflammable
matter
already
prepared
by
the
collision
of
the
spirit
of
political
freedom
with
the
power
of
the
higher
clergy
thus
arnold
addresses
produced
in
the
minds
of
the
italian
people
quite
susceptible
to
such
excitements
a
prodigious
effect
which
threatened
to
spread
more
widely
and
pope
innocent
felt
himself
called
upon
to
take
preventive
measures
against
it
at
the
lateran
council
in
the
year
he
declared
against
arnold
proceedings
and
commanded
him
to
quit
italy
the
scene
of
the
disturbances
thus
far
and
not
to
return
again
without
express
permission
from
the
pope
arnold
moreover
is
said
to
have
bound
himself
by
an
oath
to
obey
this
injunction
which
probably
was
expressed
in
such
terms
as
to
leave
him
free
to
interpret
it
as
referring
exclusively
to
the
person
of
pope
innocent
if
the
oath
was
not
so
expressed
he
might
afterward
have
been
accused
of
violating
that
oath
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
form
in
which
the
sentence
was
pronounced
against
arnold
has
not
come
down
to
us
but
from
its
very
character
it
is
evident
that
he
could
not
have
been
convicted
of
any
false
doctrine
since
otherwise
the
pope
would
certainly
not
have
treated
him
so
mildly
would
not
have
been
contented
with
merely
banishing
him
from
italy
since
teachers
of
false
doctrine
would
be
dangerous
to
the
church
everywhere
bernard
moreover
in
his
letter
directed
against
arnold
states
that
he
was
accused
before
the
pope
of
being
the
author
of
a
very
bad
schism
arnold
now
betook
himself
to
france
and
here
he
became
entangled
in
the
quarrels
with
his
old
teacher
abelard
to
whom
he
was
indebted
for
the
first
impulse
of
his
mind
toward
this
more
serious
and
free
bent
of
the
religious
spirit
expelled
from
france
he
directed
his
steps
to
switzerland
and
sojourned
in
zurich
the
abbot
bernard
thought
it
necessary
to
caution
the
bishop
of
constance
against
him
but
the
man
who
had
been
condemned
by
the
pope
found
protection
there
from
the
papal
legate
cardinal
guido
who
indeed
made
him
a
member
of
his
household
and
companion
of
his
table
the
abbot
bernard
severely
censured
the
prelate
on
the
ground
that
arnold
connection
with
him
would
contribute
without
fail
to
give
importance
and
influence
to
that
dangerous
man
this
deserves
to
be
noticed
on
two
accounts
for
it
makes
it
evident
what
power
he
could
exercise
over
men
minds
and
that
no
false
doctrines
could
be
charged
to
his
account
but
independent
of
arnold
personal
presence
the
impulse
which
he
had
given
continued
to
operate
in
italy
and
the
effects
of
it
extended
even
to
rome
by
the
papal
condemnation
public
attention
was
only
more
strongly
drawn
to
the
subject
the
romans
certainly
felt
no
great
sympathy
for
the
religious
element
in
that
serious
spirit
of
reform
which
animated
arnold
but
the
political
movements
which
had
sprung
out
of
his
reforming
tendency
found
a
point
of
attachment
in
their
love
of
liberty
and
their
dreams
of
the
ancient
dominion
of
rome
over
the
world
the
idea
of
emancipating
themselves
from
the
yoke
of
the
pope
and
of
reestablishing
the
old
republic
flattered
their
roman
pride
espousing
the
principles
of
arnold
they
required
that
the
pope
as
spiritual
head
of
the
church
should
confine
himself
to
the
administration
of
spiritual
affairs
and
they
committed
to
a
senate
the
supreme
direction
of
civil
affairs
innocent
could
do
nothing
to
stem
such
a
violent
current
and
he
died
in
the
midst
of
these
disturbances
in
the
year
the
mild
cardinal
guido
the
friend
of
abelard
and
arnold
became
his
successor
and
called
himself
when
pope
celestine
ii
by
his
gentleness
quiet
was
restored
for
a
short
time
perhaps
it
was
the
news
of
the
elevation
of
this
friendly
man
to
the
papal
throne
that
encouraged
arnold
himself
to
come
to
rome
but
celestine
died
after
six
months
and
lucius
ii
was
his
successor
under
his
reign
the
romans
renewed
the
former
agitations
with
more
violence
they
utterly
renounced
obedience
to
the
pope
whom
they
recognized
only
in
his
priestly
character
and
the
restored
roman
republic
sought
to
strike
a
league
in
opposition
to
the
pope
and
to
papacy
with
the
new
emperor
conrad
iii
in
the
name
of
the
senate
and
roman
people
a
pompous
letter
was
addressed
to
conrad
the
emperor
was
invited
to
come
to
rome
that
from
thence
like
justinian
and
constantine
in
former
days
he
might
give
laws
to
the
world
caesar
should
have
the
things
that
are
caesar
the
priest
the
things
that
are
the
priest
as
christ
ordained
when
peter
paid
the
tribute
money
long
did
the
tendency
awakened
by
arnold
principles
continue
to
agitate
rome
in
the
letters
written
amidst
these
commotions
by
individual
noblemen
of
rome
to
the
emperor
we
perceive
a
singular
mixing
together
of
the
arnoldian
spirit
with
the
dreams
of
roman
vanity
a
radical
tendency
to
the
separation
of
secular
from
spiritual
things
which
if
it
had
been
capable
enough
in
itself
and
if
it
could
have
found
more
points
of
attachment
in
the
age
would
have
brought
destruction
on
the
old
theocratical
system
of
the
church
they
said
that
the
pope
could
claim
no
political
sovereignty
in
rome
he
could
not
even
be
consecrated
without
the
consent
of
the
emperor
a
rule
which
had
in
fact
been
observed
till
the
time
of
gregory
vii
men
complained
of
the
worldliness
of
the
clergy
of
their
bad
lives
of
the
contradiction
between
their
conduct
and
the
teachings
of
scripture
the
popes
were
accused
as
the
instigators
of
the
wars
the
popes
it
was
said
should
no
longer
unite
the
cup
of
the
eucharist
with
the
sword
it
was
their
vocation
to
preach
and
to
confirm
what
they
preached
by
good
works
how
could
those
who
eagerly
grasped
at
all
the
wealth
of
this
world
and
corrupted
the
true
riches
of
the
church
the
doctrine
of
salvation
obtained
by
christ
by
their
false
doctrines
and
their
luxurious
living
receive
that
word
of
our
lord
are
the
poor
in
spirit
when
they
were
poor
themselves
neither
in
fact
nor
in
disposition
even
the
donative
of
constantine
to
the
roman
bishop
silvester
was
declared
to
be
a
pitiable
fiction
this
lie
had
been
so
clearly
exposed
that
it
was
obvious
to
the
very
and
to
women
and
that
these
could
put
to
silence
the
most
learned
men
if
they
ventured
to
defend
the
genuineness
of
this
donative
so
that
the
pope
with
his
cardinals
no
longer
dared
to
appear
in
public
but
arnold
was
perhaps
the
only
individual
in
whose
case
such
a
tendency
was
deeply
rooted
in
religious
conviction
with
many
it
was
but
a
transitory
intoxication
in
which
their
political
interests
had
become
merged
for
the
moment
the
pope
lucius
ii
was
killed
as
early
as
in
the
attack
on
the
capitol
a
scholar
of
the
great
abbot
bernard
the
abbot
peter
bernard
of
pisa
now
mounted
the
papal
chair
under
the
name
of
eugene
iii
as
eugene
honored
and
loved
the
abbot
bernard
as
his
spiritual
father
and
old
preceptor
so
the
latter
took
advantage
of
his
relation
to
the
pope
to
speak
the
truth
to
him
with
a
plainness
which
no
other
man
would
easily
have
ventured
to
use
in
congratulating
him
upon
his
elevation
to
the
papal
dignity
he
took
occasion
to
exhort
him
to
do
away
with
the
many
abuses
which
had
become
so
widely
spread
in
the
church
by
worldly
influences
who
will
give
me
the
satisfaction
said
he
in
his
letter
of
beholding
the
church
of
god
before
i
die
in
a
condition
like
that
in
which
it
was
in
ancient
days
when
the
apostles
threw
out
their
nets
not
for
silver
and
gold
but
for
souls
how
fervently
i
wish
thou
mightest
inherit
the
word
of
that
apostle
whose
episcopal
seat
thou
hast
acquired
of
him
who
said
gold
perish
with
thee
oh
that
all
the
enemies
of
zion
might
tremble
before
this
dreadful
word
and
shrink
back
abashed
this
thy
mother
indeed
expects
and
requires
of
thee
for
this
long
and
sigh
the
sons
of
thy
mother
small
and
great
that
every
plant
which
our
father
in
heaven
has
not
planted
may
be
rooted
up
by
thy
hands
he
then
alluded
to
the
sudden
deaths
of
the
last
predecessors
of
the
pope
exhorting
him
to
humility
and
reminding
him
of
his
responsibility
in
all
thy
works
he
wrote
remember
that
thou
art
a
man
and
let
the
fear
of
him
who
taketh
away
the
breath
of
rulers
be
ever
before
thine
eyes
eugene
was
soon
forced
to
yield
it
is
true
to
the
superior
force
of
the
insurrectionary
spirit
in
rome
and
in
to
take
refuge
in
france
but
like
urban
and
innocent
he
too
from
this
country
attained
to
the
highest
triumph
of
the
papal
power
like
innocent
he
found
there
in
the
abbot
bernard
of
clairvaux
a
mightier
instrument
for
operating
on
the
minds
of
the
age
than
he
could
have
found
in
any
other
country
and
like
urban
when
banished
from
the
ancient
seat
of
the
papacy
he
was
enabled
to
place
himself
at
the
head
of
a
crusade
proclaimed
in
his
name
and
undertaken
with
great
enthusiasm
an
enterprise
from
which
a
new
impression
of
sacredness
would
be
reflected
back
upon
his
own
person
the
news
of
the
success
which
had
attended
the
arms
of
the
saracens
in
syria
the
defeat
of
the
christians
the
conquest
of
the
ancient
christian
territory
of
edessa
the
danger
which
threatened
the
new
christian
kingdom
of
jerusalem
and
the
holy
city
had
spread
alarm
among
the
western
nations
and
the
pope
considered
himself
bound
to
summon
the
christians
of
the
west
to
the
assistance
of
their
brethren
in
the
faith
and
to
the
recovery
of
the
holy
places
by
a
letter
directed
to
the
abbot
bernard
he
commissioned
him
to
exhort
the
western
christians
in
his
name
that
for
penance
and
forgiveness
of
sins
they
should
march
to
the
east
to
deliver
their
brethren
or
to
give
up
their
lives
for
them
enthusiastic
for
the
cause
himself
bernard
communicated
through
the
power
of
the
living
word
and
by
letters
his
enthusiasm
to
the
nations
he
represented
the
new
crusade
as
a
means
furnished
by
god
to
the
multitudes
sunk
in
sin
of
calling
them
to
repentance
and
of
paving
the
way
by
devout
participation
in
a
pious
work
for
the
forgiveness
of
their
sins
thus
in
his
letter
to
the
clergy
and
people
in
east
frankland
germany
he
exhorts
them
eagerly
to
lay
hold
on
this
opportunity
he
declares
that
the
almighty
condescended
to
invite
murderers
robbers
adulterers
perjurers
and
those
sunk
in
other
crimes
into
his
service
as
well
as
the
righteous
he
calls
upon
them
to
make
an
end
of
waging
war
with
one
another
and
to
seek
an
object
for
their
warlike
prowess
in
this
holy
contest
here
brave
warrior
he
exclaims
thou
hast
a
field
where
thou
mayest
fight
without
danger
where
victory
is
glory
and
death
is
gain
take
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
thou
shalt
obtain
the
forgiveness
of
all
the
sins
which
thou
hast
never
confessed
with
a
contrite
heart
by
bernard
fiery
discourses
men
of
all
ranks
were
carried
away
in
france
and
in
germany
he
travelled
about
conquering
by
an
effort
his
great
bodily
infirmities
and
the
living
word
from
his
lips
produced
even
mightier
effects
than
his
letters
a
peculiar
charm
and
a
peculiar
power
of
moving
men
minds
must
have
existed
in
the
tones
of
his
voice
to
this
must
be
added
the
effect
of
his
whole
appearance
the
way
in
which
his
whole
being
and
the
motions
of
his
bodily
frame
joined
in
testifying
of
that
which
seized
and
inspired
him
thus
it
admits
of
being
explained
how
in
germany
even
those
who
understood
but
little
or
in
fact
nothing
of
what
he
said
could
be
so
moved
as
to
shed
tears
and
smite
their
breasts
could
by
his
own
speeches
in
a
foreign
language
be
more
strongly
affected
and
agitated
than
by
the
immediate
interpretation
of
his
words
by
another
from
all
quarters
sick
persons
were
conveyed
to
him
by
the
friends
who
sought
from
him
a
cure
and
the
power
of
his
faith
the
confidence
he
inspired
in
the
minds
of
men
might
sometimes
produce
remarkable
effects
with
this
enthusiasm
however
bernard
united
a
degree
of
prudence
and
a
discernment
of
character
such
as
few
of
that
age
possessed
and
such
qualities
were
required
to
counteract
the
multiform
excitements
of
the
wild
spirit
of
fanaticism
which
mixed
in
with
this
great
ferment
of
minds
thus
he
warned
the
germans
not
to
suffer
themselves
to
be
misled
so
far
as
to
follow
certain
independent
enthusiasts
ignorant
of
war
who
were
bent
on
moving
forward
the
bodies
of
the
crusaders
prematurely
he
held
up
as
a
warning
the
example
of
peter
the
hermit
and
declared
himself
very
decidedly
opposed
to
the
proposition
of
an
abbot
who
was
disposed
to
march
with
a
number
of
monks
to
jerusalem
for
said
he
fighting
warriors
are
more
needed
there
than
singing
monks
at
an
assembly
held
at
chartres
it
was
proposed
that
he
himself
should
take
the
lead
of
the
expedition
but
he
rejected
the
proposition
at
once
declaring
that
it
was
beyond
his
power
and
contrary
to
his
calling
having
perhaps
reason
to
fear
that
the
pope
might
be
hurried
on
by
the
shouts
of
the
many
to
lay
upon
him
some
charge
to
which
he
did
not
feel
himself
called
he
besought
the
pope
that
he
would
not
make
him
a
victim
to
men
arbitrary
will
but
that
he
would
inquire
as
it
was
his
duty
to
do
how
god
had
determined
to
dispose
of
him
with
the
preaching
of
this
second
crusade
as
with
the
invitation
to
the
first
was
connected
an
extraordinary
awakening
many
who
had
hitherto
given
themselves
up
to
their
unrestrained
passions
and
desires
and
become
strangers
to
all
higher
feelings
were
seized
with
compunction
bernard
call
to
repentance
penetrated
many
a
heart
people
who
had
lived
in
all
manner
of
crime
were
seen
following
this
voice
and
flocking
together
in
troops
to
receive
the
badge
of
the
cross
bishop
otto
of
freisingen
the
historian
who
himself
took
the
cross
at
that
time
expresses
it
as
his
opinion
that
every
man
of
sound
understanding
would
be
forced
to
acknowledge
so
sudden
and
uncommon
a
change
could
have
been
produced
in
no
other
way
than
by
the
right
hand
of
the
lord
the
provost
gerhoh
of
reichersberg
who
wrote
in
the
midst
of
these
movements
was
persuaded
that
he
saw
here
a
work
of
the
holy
spirit
designed
to
counteract
the
vices
and
corruptions
which
had
got
the
upper
hand
in
the
church
many
who
had
been
awakened
to
repentance
confessed
what
they
had
taken
from
others
by
robbery
or
fraud
and
hastened
before
they
went
to
the
holy
war
to
seek
reconciliation
with
their
enemies
the
christian
enthusiasm
of
the
german
people
found
utterance
in
songs
in
the
german
tongue
and
even
now
the
peculiar
adaptation
of
this
language
to
sacred
poetry
began
to
be
remarked
indecent
songs
could
no
longer
venture
to
appear
abroad
while
some
were
awakened
by
bernard
preaching
from
a
life
of
crime
to
repentance
and
by
taking
part
in
the
holy
war
strove
to
obtain
the
remission
of
their
sins
others
again
who
though
hitherto
borne
along
in
the
current
of
ordinary
worldly
pursuits
yet
had
not
given
themselves
up
to
vice
were
filled
by
bernard
words
with
loathing
of
the
worldly
life
inflamed
with
a
vehement
longing
after
a
higher
stage
of
christian
perfection
after
a
life
of
entire
consecration
to
god
they
longed
rather
to
enter
upon
the
pilgrimage
to
the
heavenly
than
to
an
earthly
jerusalem
they
resolved
to
become
monks
and
would
fain
have
the
man
of
god
himself
whose
words
had
made
so
deep
an
impression
on
their
hearts
as
their
guide
in
the
spiritual
life
and
commit
themselves
to
his
directions
in
the
monastery
of
clairvaux
but
here
bernard
showed
his
prudence
and
knowledge
of
mankind
he
did
not
allow
all
to
become
monks
who
wished
to
do
so
many
he
rejected
because
he
perceived
they
were
not
fitted
for
the
quiet
of
the
contemplative
life
but
needed
to
be
disciplined
by
the
conflicts
and
cares
of
a
life
of
action
as
contemporaries
themselves
acknowledge
these
first
impressions
in
the
case
of
many
who
went
to
the
crusades
were
of
no
permanent
duration
and
their
old
nature
broke
forth
again
the
more
strongly
under
the
manifold
temptations
to
which
they
were
exposed
in
proportion
to
the
facility
with
which
through
the
confidence
they
reposed
in
a
plenary
indulgence
without
really
laying
to
heart
the
condition
upon
which
it
was
bestowed
they
could
flatter
themselves
with
security
in
their
sins
gerhoh
of
reichersberg
in
describing
the
blessed
effects
of
that
awakening
which
accompanied
the
preaching
of
the
crusader
yet
says
we
doubt
not
that
among
so
vast
a
multitude
some
became
in
the
true
sense
and
in
all
sincerity
soldiers
of
christ
some
however
were
led
to
embark
in
the
enterprise
by
various
other
occasions
concerning
whom
it
does
not
belong
to
us
to
judge
but
only
to
him
who
alone
knows
the
hearts
of
those
who
marched
to
the
contest
either
in
the
right
or
not
in
the
right
spirit
yet
this
we
do
confidently
affirm
that
to
this
crusade
many
were
called
but
few
were
chosen
and
it
was
said
that
many
returned
from
this
expedition
not
better
but
worse
than
they
went
therefore
the
monk
cesarius
of
heisterbach
who
states
this
adds
all
depends
on
bearing
the
yoke
of
christ
not
year
or
years
but
daily
if
a
man
is
really
intent
on
doing
it
in
truth
and
in
that
sense
in
which
our
lord
requires
it
to
be
done
in
order
to
follow
him
when
it
turned
out
however
that
the
event
did
not
answer
the
expectations
excited
by
bernard
enthusiastic
confidence
but
the
crusade
came
to
that
unfortunate
issue
which
was
brought
about
especially
by
the
treachery
of
the
princes
and
nobles
of
the
christian
kingdom
in
syria
this
was
a
source
of
great
chagrin
to
bernard
who
had
been
so
active
in
setting
it
in
motion
and
who
had
inspired
such
confident
hopes
by
his
promises
he
appeared
now
in
the
light
of
a
bad
prophet
and
he
was
reproached
by
many
with
having
incited
men
to
engage
in
an
enterprise
which
had
cost
so
much
blood
to
no
purpose
but
bernard
friends
alleged
in
his
defence
that
he
had
not
excited
such
a
popular
movement
but
as
the
organ
of
the
pope
in
whose
name
he
acted
and
they
appealed
to
the
facts
by
which
his
preaching
of
the
cross
was
proved
to
be
a
work
of
god
to
the
wonders
which
attended
it
or
they
ascribed
the
failure
of
the
undertaking
to
the
bad
conduct
of
the
crusaders
themselves
to
the
unchristian
mode
of
life
which
many
of
them
led
as
one
of
these
friends
maintained
in
a
consoling
letter
to
bernard
himself
adding
god
however
has
turned
it
to
good
numbers
who
if
they
had
returned
home
would
have
continued
to
live
a
life
of
crime
disciplined
and
purified
by
many
sufferings
have
passed
into
the
life
eternal
but
bernard
himself
could
not
be
staggered
in
his
faith
by
this
event
in
writing
to
pope
eugene
on
this
subject
he
refers
to
the
incomprehensibleness
of
the
divine
ways
and
judgments
to
the
example
of
moses
who
although
his
work
carried
on
its
face
incontestable
evidence
of
being
a
work
of
god
yet
was
not
permitted
himself
to
conduct
the
jews
into
the
promised
land
as
this
was
owing
to
the
fault
of
the
jews
themselves
so
too
the
crusaders
had
none
to
blame
but
themselves
for
the
failure
of
the
divine
work
but
says
he
it
will
be
said
perhaps
how
do
we
know
that
this
work
came
from
the
lord
what
miracle
dost
thou
work
that
we
should
believe
thee
to
this
question
i
need
not
give
an
answer
it
is
a
point
on
which
my
modesty
asks
to
be
excused
from
speaking
do
you
answer
says
he
to
the
pope
for
me
and
for
yourself
according
to
that
which
you
have
seen
and
heard
so
firmly
was
bernard
convinced
that
god
had
sustained
his
labors
by
miracles
eugene
was
at
length
enabled
in
the
year
after
having
for
a
long
time
excited
against
himself
the
indignation
of
the
cardinals
by
his
dependence
on
the
french
abbot
with
the
assistance
of
roger
king
of
the
sicilies
to
return
to
rome
where
however
he
still
had
to
maintain
a
struggle
with
the
party
of
arnold
the
provost
gerhoh
finds
something
to
complain
of
in
the
fact
that
the
church
of
peter
wore
so
warlike
an
aspect
that
men
beheld
the
tomb
of
the
apostle
surrounded
with
bastions
and
the
implements
of
war
as
bernard
was
no
longer
sufficiently
near
the
pope
to
exert
on
him
the
same
immediate
personal
influence
as
in
times
past
he
addressed
to
him
a
voice
of
admonition
and
warning
such
as
the
mighty
of
the
earth
seldom
enjoy
the
privilege
of
hearing
with
the
frankness
of
a
love
which
as
he
himself
expresses
it
knew
not
the
master
but
recognized
the
son
even
under
the
pontifical
robes
he
set
before
him
in
his
four
books
which
he
sent
to
him
singly
at
different
times
the
duties
of
his
office
and
the
faults
against
which
in
order
to
fulfil
these
duties
he
needed
especially
to
guard
bernard
was
penetrated
with
a
conviction
that
to
the
pope
as
peter
successor
was
committed
by
god
a
sovereign
power
of
church
government
over
all
and
responsible
to
no
other
tribunal
that
to
this
church
theocracy
guided
by
the
pope
the
administration
even
of
the
secular
power
though
independent
within
its
own
peculiar
sphere
should
be
subjected
for
the
service
of
the
kingdom
of
god
but
he
also
perceived
with
the
deepest
pain
how
very
far
the
papacy
was
from
corresponding
to
this
its
idea
and
destination
what
prodigious
corruption
had
sprung
and
continued
to
spring
from
the
abuse
of
papal
authority
he
perceived
already
with
prophetic
eye
that
this
very
abuse
of
arbitrary
will
must
eventually
bring
about
the
destruction
of
this
power
he
desired
that
the
pope
should
disentangle
himself
from
the
secular
part
of
his
office
and
reduce
that
office
within
the
purely
spiritual
domain
and
that
above
all
he
should
learn
to
govern
and
restrict
himself
but
to
the
close
of
his
life
in
the
year
pope
eugene
had
to
contend
with
the
turbulent
spirit
of
the
romans
and
the
influences
of
the
principles
disseminated
by
arnold
and
this
contest
was
prolonged
into
the
reign
of
his
second
successor
adrian
iv
among
the
people
and
among
the
nobles
a
considerable
party
had
arisen
who
would
concede
to
the
pope
no
kind
of
secular
dominion
and
there
seems
to
have
been
a
shade
of
difference
among
the
members
of
this
party
a
mob
of
the
people
is
said
to
have
gone
to
such
an
extreme
of
arrogance
as
to
propose
the
choosing
of
a
new
emperor
from
among
the
romans
themselves
the
restoration
of
a
roman
empire
independent
of
the
pope
the
other
party
to
which
belonged
the
nobles
were
for
placing
the
emperor
frederick
i
at
the
head
of
the
roman
republic
and
uniting
themselves
with
him
in
a
common
interest
against
the
pope
they
invited
him
to
receive
the
imperial
crown
in
the
ancient
manner
from
the
senate
and
roman
people
and
not
from
the
heretical
and
recreant
clergy
and
false
monks
who
acted
in
contradiction
to
their
calling
exercising
lordship
despite
of
the
evangelical
and
apostolical
doctrine
and
in
contempt
of
all
laws
divine
and
human
brought
the
church
of
god
and
the
kingdom
of
the
world
into
confusion
those
who
pretend
that
they
are
the
representatives
of
peter
it
was
said
in
a
letter
addressed
in
the
spirit
of
this
party
to
the
emperor
frederick
i
act
in
contradiction
to
the
doctrines
which
that
apostle
teaches
in
his
epistles
how
can
they
say
with
the
apostle
peter
we
have
left
all
and
followed
thee
and
and
gold
have
i
none
how
can
our
lord
say
to
such
are
the
light
of
the
world
salt
of
the
earth
much
rather
is
to
be
applied
to
them
what
our
lord
says
of
the
salt
that
has
lost
its
savor
after
earthly
riches
they
spoil
the
true
riches
from
which
the
salvation
of
the
world
has
proceeded
how
can
the
saying
be
applied
to
them
are
the
poor
in
spirit
for
they
are
neither
poor
in
spirit
nor
in
fact
pope
adrian
iv
was
first
enabled
under
more
favorable
circumstances
and
assisted
by
the
emperor
frederick
i
to
deprive
the
arnold
party
of
its
leader
and
then
to
suppress
it
entirely
it
so
happened
that
in
the
first
year
of
adrian
reign
a
cardinal
on
his
way
to
visit
the
pope
was
attacked
and
wounded
by
followers
of
arnold
this
induced
the
pope
to
put
all
rome
under
the
interdict
with
a
view
to
force
the
expulsion
of
arnold
and
his
party
this
means
did
not
fail
of
its
effect
the
people
who
could
not
bear
the
suspension
of
divine
worship
now
themselves
compelled
the
nobles
to
bring
about
the
ejection
of
arnold
and
his
friends
arnold
on
leaving
rome
found
protection
from
italian
nobles
by
the
order
however
of
the
emperor
frederick
who
had
come
into
italy
he
was
torn
from
his
protectors
and
surrendered
up
to
the
papal
authority
the
prefect
of
rome
then
took
possession
of
his
person
and
caused
him
to
be
hanged
his
body
was
burned
and
its
ashes
thrown
into
the
tiber
lest
his
bones
might
be
preserved
as
the
relics
of
a
martyr
by
the
romans
who
were
enthusiastically
devoted
to
him
worthy
men
who
were
in
other
respects
zealous
defenders
of
the
church
orthodoxy
and
of
the
hierarchy
as
for
example
gerhoh
of
reichersberg
expressed
their
disapprobation
first
that
arnold
should
be
punished
with
death
on
account
of
the
errors
which
he
disseminated
secondly
that
the
sentence
of
death
should
proceed
from
a
spiritual
tribunal
or
that
such
a
tribunal
should
at
least
have
subjected
itself
to
that
bad
appearance
but
on
the
part
of
the
roman
court
it
was
alleged
in
defence
of
this
proceeding
that
it
was
done
without
the
knowledge
and
contrary
to
the
will
of
the
roman
curia
the
prefect
of
rome
had
forcibly
removed
arnold
from
the
prison
where
he
was
kept
and
his
servants
had
put
him
to
death
in
revenge
for
injuries
they
had
suffered
from
arnold
party
arnold
therefore
was
executed
not
on
account
of
his
doctrines
but
in
consequence
of
tumults
excited
by
himself
it
may
be
a
question
whether
this
was
said
with
sincerity
or
whether
according
to
the
proverb
a
confession
of
guilt
is
not
implied
in
the
excuse
but
gerhoh
was
of
the
opinion
that
in
this
case
they
should
at
least
have
done
as
david
did
in
the
case
of
abner
death
and
by
allowing
arnold
to
be
buried
and
his
death
to
be
mourned
over
instead
of
causing
his
body
to
be
burned
and
the
remains
thrown
into
the
tiber
washed
their
hands
of
the
whole
transaction
but
the
idea
for
which
arnold
had
contended
and
for
which
he
died
continued
to
work
in
various
forms
even
after
his
death
the
idea
of
a
purification
of
the
church
from
the
foreign
worldly
elements
with
which
it
had
become
vitiated
of
its
restoration
to
its
original
spiritual
character
decline
of
the
byzantine
empire
ravages
of
roger
of
sicily
george
finlay
from
the
enthronement
of
the
commenian
dynasty
in
which
was
accomplished
through
a
successful
rebellion
attended
by
shameful
treachery
and
rapine
the
byzantine
empire
and
especially
constantinople
its
capital
passed
through
many
vicissitudes
but
the
sack
of
the
city
by
alexius
commenus
the
founder
of
the
line
was
remembered
by
the
populace
to
the
disadvantage
of
all
his
successors
the
last
of
whom
andronicus
i
ended
his
reign
in
john
the
son
of
alexius
ruled
with
discretion
and
ability
and
recovered
some
territory
from
the
turks
manuel
i
the
son
of
john
ruled
during
a
period
of
almost
constant
war
and
for
a
time
he
held
the
enemies
of
the
empire
in
check
but
he
appears
to
have
been
more
endowed
with
courage
and
the
spirit
of
enterprise
than
with
good
judgment
and
his
conduct
of
the
empire
coincided
with
events
that
as
seen
in
history
contributed
to
its
decline
which
after
his
death
followed
rapidly
as
this
decline
is
to
be
dated
especially
from
the
passing
but
not
ineffectual
invasion
of
roger
ii
king
of
sicily
in
some
account
of
that
together
with
a
view
of
conditions
immediately
preceding
becomes
important
in
a
work
like
this
the
century
and
a
half
before
roger
invasion
had
been
a
period
of
tranquillity
for
the
distinctively
greek
people
of
the
empire
who
had
increased
rapidly
in
numbers
and
wealth
and
were
in
possession
of
an
extensive
commerce
and
many
manufactures
therefore
they
were
perhaps
the
greatest
sufferers
from
the
adverse
events
which
befell
the
state
the
emperor
alexius
i
had
concluded
a
commercial
treaty
with
pisa
toward
the
end
of
his
reign
manuel
renewed
this
alliance
and
he
appears
to
have
been
the
first
of
the
byzantine
emperors
who
concluded
a
public
treaty
with
genoa
the
pride
of
the
emperors
of
the
romans
as
the
sovereigns
of
constantinople
were
styled
induced
them
to
treat
the
italian
republics
as
municipalities
still
dependent
on
the
empire
of
the
caesars
of
which
they
had
once
formed
a
part
and
the
rulers
both
of
pisa
and
genoa
yielded
to
this
assumption
of
supremacy
and
consented
to
appear
as
vassals
and
liegemen
of
the
byzantine
emperors
in
order
to
participate
in
the
profits
which
they

as
with

have
been

the

of
the

are
embodied
in
the

enumerating
the
concessions
granted
by

the
document
is
called
a

of

to
it
as
the
certificate
of

authenticity
in

treaties
with
the
genoese
and

the

bind
themselves
never
to
engage
in

against
the

on
the
contrary
all
the
subjects
of
the

residing
in
the

become
bound
to
assist

against
all

they
submit
their
civil
and
criminal
affairs
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the

as
was
then
the
case
with
the

and

foreigners
in
the

acts
of

and

violence
unless
the

were
taken
in

were
to
be
reported
to
the
rulers
of
the
republic
whose
subjects
had
committed
the
crime
and
the
byzantine
authorities
were
not
to
render
the
innocent
traders
in
the
empire
responsible
for
the
injuries
inflicted
by
these
brigands
the
republicans
engaged
to
observe
all
the
stipulations
in
their
treaties
in
defiance
of
ecclesiastical
excommunication
or
the
prohibition
of
any
individual
crowned
or
not
crowned
manuel
in
return
granted
to
the
republicans
the
right
of
forming
a
factory
erecting
a
quay
for
landing
their
goods
and
building
a
church
and
the
genoese
received
their
grant
in
an
agreeable
position
on
the
side
of
the
port
opposite
constantinople
where
in
their
great
colony
of
galata
was
formed
the
emperor
promised
to
send
an
annual
of
from
four
hundred
to
five
hundred
gold
bezants
with
two
pieces
of
a
rich
brocade
then
manufactured
only
in
the
byzantine
empire
to
the
republican
governments
and
sixty
bezants
with
one
piece
of
brocade
to
their
archbishops
these
treaties
fixed
the
duty
levied
on
the
goods
imported
or
exported
from
constantinople
by
the
italians
at
per
cent
but
in
the
other
cities
of
the
empire
the
pisans
and
genoese
were
to
pay
the
same
duties
as
other
latin
traders
excepting
of
course
the
privileged
venetians
these
duties
generally
amounted
to
per
cent
the
republics
were
expressly
excluded
by
the
genoese
treaty
from
the
black
sea
trade
except
when
they
received
a
special
license
from
the
emperor
in
case
of
shipwreck
the
property
of
the
foreigners
was
to
be
protected
by
the
imperial
authorities
and
respected
by
the
people
and
every
assistance
was
to
be
granted
to
the
unfortunate
sufferers
this
humane
clause
was
not
new
in
byzantine
commercial
treaties
for
it
is
contained
in
the
earliest
treaty
concluded
by
alexius
i
with
the
pisans
on
the
whole
the
arrangements
for
the
administration
of
justice
in
these
treaties
prove
that
the
byzantine
empire
still
enjoyed
a
greater
degree
of
order
than
the
rest
of
europe
the
state
of
civilization
in
the
eastern
empire
rendered
the
public
finances
the
moving
power
of
the
government
as
in
the
nations
of
modern
europe
this
must
always
tend
to
the
centralization
of
political
authority
for
the
highest
branch
of
the
executive
will
always
endeavor
to
dispose
of
the
revenues
of
the
state
according
to
its
views
of
necessity
this
centralizing
policy
led
manuel
to
order
all
the
money
which
the
greek
commercial
communities
had
hitherto
devoted
to
maintaining
local
squadrons
of
galleys
for
the
defence
of
the
islands
and
coasts
of
the
aegean
to
be
remitted
to
the
treasury
at
constantinople
the
ships
were
compelled
to
visit
the
imperial
dockyard
in
the
capital
to
undergo
repairs
and
to
receive
provisions
and
pay
a
navy
is
a
most
expensive
establishment
kings
ministers
and
people
are
all
very
apt
to
think
that
when
it
is
not
wanted
at
any
particular
time
the
cost
of
its
maintenance
may
be
more
profitably
applied
to
other
objects
manuel
after
he
had
secured
the
funds
of
the
greeks
for
his
own
treasury
soon
left
their
ships
to
rot
and
the
commerce
of
greece
became
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
small
squadrons
of
italian
pirates
who
previously
would
not
have
dared
to
plunder
in
the
archipelago
it
may
be
thought
by
some
that
manuel
acted
wisely
in
centralizing
the
naval
administration
of
his
empire
but
the
great
number
the
small
size
and
the
relative
position
of
many
of
the
greek
islands
with
regard
to
the
prevailing
winds
render
the
permanent
establishment
of
naval
stations
at
several
points
necessary
to
prevent
piracy
manuel
and
otho
ruined
the
navy
of
greece
by
their
unwise
measures
of
centralization
pericles
by
prudently
centralizing
the
maritime
forces
of
the
various
states
increased
the
naval
power
of
athens
and
gave
additional
security
to
every
greek
ship
that
navigated
the
sea
the
same
fiscal
views
which
induced
manuel
to
centralize
the
naval
administration
when
it
was
injurious
to
the
interests
of
the
empire
prompted
him
to
act
diametrically
opposite
with
regard
to
the
army
the
emperor
john
had
added
greatly
to
the
efficiency
of
the
byzantine
military
force
by
improving
and
centralizing
its
administration
and
he
left
manuel
an
excellent
army
which
rendered
the
eastern
empire
the
most
powerful
state
in
europe
but
manuel
from
motives
of
economy
abandoned
his
father
system
instead
of
assembling
all
the
military
forces
of
the
empire
annually
in
camps
where
they
received
pay
and
were
subjected
to
strict
discipline
toward
the
end
of
his
reign
he
distributed
even
the
regular
army
in
cities
and
provinces
where
they
were
quartered
far
apart
in
order
that
each
district
by
maintaining
a
certain
number
of
men
might
relieve
the
treasury
from
the
burden
of
their
pay
and
subsistence
while
they
were
not
on
actual
service
the
money
thus
retained
in
the
central
treasury
was
spent
in
idle
festivals
at
constantinople
and
the
troops
dispersed
and
neglected
became
careless
of
their
military
exercises
and
lived
in
a
state
of
relaxed
discipline
other
abuses
were
quickly
introduced
resident
yeomen
shopkeepers
and
artisans
were
enrolled
in
the
legions
with
the
connivance
of
the
officers
the
burden
of
maintaining
the
troops
was
in
this
way
diminished
but
the
army
was
deteriorated
in
other
districts
where
the
divisions
were
exposed
to
be
called
into
action
or
were
more
directly
under
central
inspection
the
effective
force
was
kept
up
at
its
full
complement
but
the
people
were
compelled
to
submit
to
every
kind
of
extortion
and
tyranny
the
tendency
of
absolute
power
being
always
to
weaken
the
power
of
the
law
and
to
increase
the
authority
of
the
executive
agents
of
the
sovereign
soon
manifested
its
effects
in
the
rapid
progress
of
administrative
corruption
the
byzantine
garrisons
in
a
few
years
became
prototypes
of
the
shopkeeping
janizaries
of
the
ottoman
empire
and
bore
no
resemblance
to
the
feudal
militia
of
western
europe
which
manuel
had
proposed
as
the
model
of
his
reform
this
change
produced
a
rapid
decline
in
the
military
strength
of
the
byzantine
army
and
accelerated
the
fall
of
the
empire
for
a
considerable
period
the
byzantine
emperors
had
been
gradually
increasing
the
proportion
of
foreign
mercenaries
in
their
service
this
practice
manuel
carried
further
than
any
of
his
predecessors
besides
the
usual
varangian
italian
and
german
guards
we
find
large
corps
of
patzinaks
franks
and
turks
enrolled
in
his
armies
and
officers
of
these
nations
occupying
situations
of
the
highest
rank
a
change
had
taken
place
in
the
military
tactics
caused
by
the
heavy
armor
and
powerful
horses
which
the
crusaders
brought
into
the
field
and
by
the
greater
personal
strength
and
skill
in
warlike
exercises
of
the
western
troops
who
had
no
occupation
from
infancy
but
gymnastic
exercises
and
athletic
amusements
the
nobility
of
the
feudal
nations
expended
more
money
on
arms
and
armor
than
on
other
luxuries
and
this
becoming
the
general
fashion
the
western
troops
were
much
better
armed
than
the
byzantine
soldiers
war
became
the
profession
of
the
higher
ranks
and
the
expense
of
military
undertakings
was
greatly
increased
by
the
military
classes
being
completely
separated
from
the
rest
of
society
the
warlike
disposition
of
manuel
led
him
to
favor
the
military
nobles
of
the
west
who
took
service
at
his
court
while
his
confidence
in
his
own
power
and
in
the
political
superiority
of
his
empire
deluded
him
with
the
hope
of
being
able
to
quell
the
turbulence
of
the
franks
and
set
bounds
to
the
ambition
and
power
of
the
popes
the
wars
of
manuel
were
sometimes
forced
on
him
by
foreign
powers
and
sometimes
commenced
for
temporary
objects
but
he
appears
never
to
have
formed
any
fixed
idea
of
the
permanent
policy
which
ought
to
have
determined
the
constant
employment
of
all
the
military
resources
at
his
command
for
the
purpose
of
advancing
the
interest
of
his
empire
and
giving
security
to
his
subjects
his
military
exploits
may
be
considered
under
three
heads
his
wars
with
the
franks
whether
in
asia
or
europe
his
wars
with
the
hungarians
and
servians
and
his
wars
with
the
turks
his
first
operations
were
against
the
principality
of
antioch
the
death
of
john
ii
caused
the
dispersion
of
the
fine
army
he
had
assembled
for
the
conquest
of
syria
but
manuel
sent
a
portion
of
that
army
and
a
strong
fleet
to
attack
the
principality
one
of
the
generals
of
the
land
forces
was
prosuch
a
turkish
officer
in
high
favor
with
his
father
raymond
of
antioch
was
no
longer
the
idle
gambler
he
had
shown
himself
in
the
camp
of
the
emperor
john
but
though
he
was
now
distinguished
by
his
courage
and
skill
in
arms
he
was
completely
defeated
and
the
imperial
army
carried
its
ravages
up
to
the
very
walls
of
antioch
while
the
fleet
laid
waste
the
coast
though
the
byzantine
troops
retired
the
losses
of
the
campaign
convinced
raymond
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
defend
antioch
should
manuel
take
the
field
in
person
he
therefore
hastened
to
constantinople
as
a
suppliant
to
sue
for
peace
but
manuel
before
admitting
him
to
an
audience
required
that
he
should
repair
to
the
tomb
of
the
emperor
john
and
ask
pardon
for
having
violated
his
former
promises
when
the
hercules
of
the
franks
as
raymond
was
called
had
submitted
to
this
humiliation
he
was
admitted
to
the
imperial
presence
swore
fealty
to
the
byzantine
empire
as
prince
of
antioch
and
became
the
vassal
of
the
emperor
manuel
the
conquest
of
edessa
by
the
mahometans
which
took
place
in
the
month
of
december
rendered
the
defence
of
antioch
by
the
latins
a
doubtful
enterprise
unless
they
could
secure
the
assistance
of
the
greeks
manuel
involved
himself
in
a
war
with
roger
king
of
sicily
which
perhaps
he
might
have
avoided
by
more
prudent
conduct
an
envoy
he
had
sent
to
the
sicilian
court
concluded
a
treaty
which
manuel
thought
fit
to
disavow
with
unsuitable
violence
this
gave
the
sicilian
king
a
pretext
for
commencing
war
but
the
real
cause
of
hostilities
must
be
sought
in
the
ambition
of
roger
and
the
hostile
feelings
of
manuel
roger
was
one
of
the
wealthiest
princes
of
his
time
he
had
united
under
his
sceptre
both
sicily
and
all
the
norman
possessions
in
southern
italy
his
ambition
was
equal
to
his
wealth
and
power
and
he
aspired
at
eclipsing
the
glory
of
robert
guiscard
and
bohemund
by
some
permanent
conquests
in
the
byzantine
empire
on
the
other
hand
the
renown
of
roger
excited
the
envy
of
manuel
who
proud
of
his
army
and
confident
of
his
own
valor
and
military
skill
hoped
to
reconquer
sicily
his
passion
made
him
forget
that
he
was
surrounded
by
numerous
enemies
who
would
combine
to
prevent
his
employing
all
his
forces
against
one
adversary
manuel
consequently
acted
imprudently
in
revealing
his
hostile
intentions
while
roger
could
direct
all
his
forces
against
one
point
and
avail
himself
of
manuel
embarrassments
he
commenced
hostilities
by
inflicting
a
blow
on
the
wealth
and
prosperity
of
greece
from
which
it
never
recovered
at
the
commencement
of
the
second
crusade
when
the
attention
of
manuel
was
anxiously
directed
to
the
movements
of
louis
vii
of
france
and
conrad
emperor
of
germany
roger
who
had
collected
a
powerful
fleet
at
brindisi
for
the
purpose
either
of
attacking
the
byzantine
empire
or
transporting
the
crusaders
to
palestine
availed
himself
of
an
insurrection
in
corfu
to
conclude
a
convention
with
the
inhabitants
who
admitted
a
garrison
of
one
thousand
norman
troops
into
their
citadel
the
corfutes
complained
with
great
reason
of
the
intolerable
weight
of
taxation
to
which
they
were
subjected
of
the
utter
neglect
of
their
interests
by
the
central
government
which
consumed
their
wealth
and
of
the
great
abuses
which
prevailed
in
the
administration
of
justice
but
the
remedy
they
adopted
by
placing
themselves
under
the
rule
of
foreign
masters
was
not
likely
to
alleviate
these
evils
the
sicilian
admiral
after
landing
the
norman
garrison
at
corfu
sailed
to
monembasia
then
one
of
the
principal
commercial
cities
in
the
east
hoping
to
gain
possession
of
it
without
difficulty
but
the
maritime
population
of
this
impregnable
fortress
gave
him
a
warm
reception
and
easily
repulsed
his
attack
after
plundering
the
coasts
of
euboea
and
attica
the
sicilian
fleet
returned
to
the
west
and
laid
waste
acarnania
and
etolia
it
then
entered
the
gulf
of
corinth
and
debarked
a
body
of
troops
at
crissa
this
force
marched
through
the
country
to
thebes
plundering
every
town
and
village
on
the
way
thebes
offered
no
resistance
and
was
plundered
in
the
most
deliberate
and
barbarous
manner
the
inhabitants
were
numerous
and
wealthy
the
soil
of
boeotia
is
extremely
productive
and
numerous
manufactures
established
in
the
city
of
thebes
gave
additional
value
to
the
abundant
produce
of
agricultural
industry
a
century
had
elapsed
since
the
citizens
of
thebes
had
gone
out
valiantly
to
fight
the
army
of
slavonian
rebels
in
the
reign
of
michael
iv
the
paphlagonian
and
that
defeat
had
long
been
forgotten
but
all
military
spirit
was
now
dead
and
the
thebans
had
so
long
lived
without
any
fear
of
invasion
that
they
had
forgotten
the
use
of
arms
the
sicilians
found
them
not
only
unprepared
to
offer
any
resistance
but
so
surprised
that
they
had
not
even
adopted
any
effectual
measures
to
secure
or
conceal
their
movable
property
the
conquerors
secure
against
all
danger
of
interruption
plundered
thebes
at
their
leisure
not
only
gold
silver
jewels
and
church
plate
were
carried
off
but
even
the
goods
found
in
the
warehouses
and
the
rarest
articles
of
furniture
in
private
houses
were
transported
to
the
ships
bales
of
silk
and
dyed
leather
were
sent
off
to
the
fleet
as
deliberately
as
if
they
had
been
legally
purchased
in
time
of
peace
when
all
ordinary
means
of
collecting
booty
were
exhausted
the
citizens
were
compelled
to
take
an
oath
on
the
holy
scriptures
that
they
had
not
concealed
any
portion
of
their
property
yet
many
of
the
wealthiest
were
dragged
away
captive
in
order
to
profit
by
their
ransom
and
many
of
the
most
skilful
workmen
in
the
silk
manufactories
for
which
thebes
had
long
been
famous
were
pressed
on
board
the
fleet
to
labor
at
the
oar
from
boeotia
the
army
passed
to
corinth
nicephorus
caluphes
the
governor
retired
into
the
but
the
garrison
appeared
to
his
cowardly
heart
not
strong
enough
to
defend
this
impregnable
fortress
and
he
surrendered
it
to
george
antiochenus
the
sicilian
admiral
on
the
first
summons
on
examining
the
fortress
of
which
he
had
thus
unexpectedly
gained
possession
the
admiral
could
not
help
exclaiming
that
he
fought
under
the
protection
of
heaven
for
if
caluphes
had
not
been
more
timid
than
a
virgin
corinth
should
have
repulsed
every
attack
corinth
was
sacked
as
cruelly
as
thebes
men
of
rank
beautiful
women
and
skilful
artisans
with
their
wives
and
families
were
carried
away
into
captivity
even
the
relics
of
theodore
were
taken
from
the
church
in
which
they
were
preserved
and
it
was
not
until
the
whole
sicilian
fleet
was
laden
with
as
much
of
the
wealth
of
greece
as
it
was
capable
of
transporting
that
the
admiral
ordered
it
to
sail
the
sicilians
did
not
venture
to
retain
possession
of
the
impregnable
citadel
of
corinth
as
it
would
have
been
extremely
difficult
for
them
to
keep
up
their
communications
with
the
garrison
this
invasion
of
greece
was
conducted
entirely
as
a
plundering
expedition
having
for
its
object
to
inflict
the
greatest
possible
injury
on
the
byzantine
empire
while
it
collected
the
largest
possible
quantity
of
booty
for
the
sicilian
troops
corfu
was
the
only
conquest
of
which
roger
retained
possession
the
ruin
of
the
greek
commerce
and
manufactures
has
been
ascribed
to
the
transference
of
the
silk
trade
from
thebes
and
corinth
to
palermo
under
the
judicious
protection
it
received
from
roger
but
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
that
the
injudicious
and
oppressive
financial
administration
of
the
byzantine
emperors
destroyed
the
commercial
prosperity
and
manufacturing
industry
of
the
greeks
while
the
wise
liberality
and
intelligent
protection
of
the
norman
kings
extended
the
commerce
and
increased
the
industry
of
the
sicilians
when
the
sicilian
fleet
returned
to
palermo
roger
determined
to
employ
all
the
silk
manufacturers
in
their
original
occupations
he
consequently
collected
all
their
families
together
and
settled
them
at
palermo
supplying
them
with
the
means
of
exercising
their
industry
with
profit
to
themselves
and
inducing
them
to
teach
his
own
subjects
to
manufacture
the
richest
brocades
and
to
rival
the
rarest
productions
of
the
east
roger
unlike
most
of
the
monarchs
of
his
age
paid
particular
attention
to
improving
the
wealth
of
his
dominions
by
increasing
the
prosperity
of
his
subjects
during
his
reign
the
cultivation
of
the
was
introduced
into
sicily
the
conduct
of
manuel
was
very
different
when
he
concluded
peace
with
william
the
son
and
successor
of
roger
in
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
commercial
interests
of
his
greek
subjects
the
silk
manufactures
of
thebes
and
corinth
were
not
reclaimed
and
reinstated
in
their
native
seats
they
were
left
to
exercise
their
industry
for
the
profit
of
their
new
prince
while
their
old
sovereign
would
have
abandoned
them
to
perish
from
want
under
such
circumstances
it
is
not
remarkable
that
the
commerce
and
the
manufactures
of
greece
were
transferred
in
the
course
of
another
