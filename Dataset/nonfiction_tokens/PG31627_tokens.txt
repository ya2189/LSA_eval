it
has
not
been
my
object
to
present
in
the
following
pages
even
an
approximately
complete
description
of
the
volcanic
and
seismic
phenomena
of
the
globe
such
an
undertaking
would
involve
an
amount
of
labour
which
few
would
be
bold
enough
to
attempt
nor
would
it
be
compatible
with
the
aims
of
the
science
i
have
rather
chosen
to
illustrate
the
most
recent
conclusions
regarding
the
phenomena
and
origin
of
volcanic
action
by
the
selection
of
examples
drawn
from
the
districts
where
these
phenomena
have
been
most
carefully
observed
and
recorded
under
the
light
of
modern
geological
science
i
have
also
endeavoured
to
show
by
illustrations
carried
back
into
later
geological
epochs
how
the
volcanic
phenomena
of
the
present
day
do
not
differ
in
kind
though
they
may
in
degree
from
those
of
the
past
history
of
our
globe
for
not
only
do
the
modes
of
eruption
of
volcanic
materials
in
past
geological
times
resemble
those
of
the
present
or
human
epoch
but
the
materials
themselves
are
so
similar
in
character
that
it
is
only
in
consequence
of
alterations
in
structure
or
composition
which
the
original
materials
have
undergone
since
their
extrusion
that
any
important
distinctions
can
be
recognised
between
the
volcanic
products
of
recent
times
and
those
of
earlier
periods
i
have
finally
endeavoured
to
find
an
answer
to
two
interesting
and
important
questions
are
we
now
living
in
an
epoch
of
extraordinary
volcanic
energy
a
question
which
such
terrible
outbursts
as
we
have
recently
witnessed
in
japan
the
malay
archipelago
and
even
in
italy
naturally
suggest
and
what
is
the
ultimate
cause
of
volcanic
action
on
this
latter
point
i
am
gratified
to
find
that
my
conclusions
are
in
accordance
with
those
expounded
by
one
who
has
been
appropriately
designated
the
nestor
of
modern
geology
professor
prestwich
within
the
last
few
years
the
study
of
the
structure
and
composition
of
volcanic
rocks
by
means
of
the
microscope
brought
to
bear
on
their
translucent
sections
has
added
wonderfully
to
our
knowledge
of
such
rocks
and
has
become
a
special
branch
of
petrological
investigation
commenced
by
sorby
and
carried
on
by
allport
zirkel
rosenbusch
von
lasaulx
teall
and
many
more
enthusiastic
students
it
has
thrown
a
flood
of
light
upon
our
knowledge
of
the
mutual
relations
of
the
component
minerals
of
igneous
masses
the
alteration
these
minerals
have
undergone
in
some
cases
and
the
conditions
under
which
they
have
been
erupted
and
consolidated
but
nothing
that
has
been
observed
has
tended
materially
to
alter
conclusions
arrived
at
by
other
processes
of
reasoning
regarding
volcanic
phenomena
and
for
these
we
have
to
fall
back
upon
observations
conducted
in
the
field
on
a
more
or
less
large
scale
and
carried
on
before
during
and
after
eruptions
macroscopic
and
microscopic
observations

historic

of

there
are
no
manifestations
of
the
forces
of
nature
more
calculated
to
inspire
us
with
feelings
of
awe
and
admiration
than
volcanic
eruptions
preceded
or
accompanied
as
they
generally
are
by
earthquake
shocks
few
agents
have
been
so
destructive
in
their
effects
and
to
the
real
dangers
which
follow
such
terrestrial
convulsions
are
to
be
added
the
feelings
of
uncertainty
and
revulsion
which
arise
from
the
fact
that
the
earth
upon
which
we
tread
and
which
we
have
been
accustomed
to
regard
as
the
emblem
of
stability
may
become
at
any
moment
the
agent
of
our
destruction
it
is
therefore
not
surprising
that
the
ancient
greeks
who
as
well
as
the
romans
were
close
observers
of
the
phenomena
of
nature
should
have
investigated
the
causes
of
terrestrial
disturbances
and
should
have
come
to
some
conclusions
upon
them
in
accordance
with
the
light
they
possessed
these
terrible
forces
presented
to
the
greeks
who
clothed
all
the
operations
of
nature
in
poetic
imagery
and
deified
her
forces
their
poetical
and
mystical
side
and
as
there
was
a
deity
for
every
natural
force
so
there
was
one
for
earthquakes
and
volcanoes
vulcan
the
deformed
son
of
juno
whose
name
bears
so
strange
a
resemblance
to
that
of
the
first
artificer
in
iron
of
the
bible
tubal
cain
is
condemned
to
pass
his
days
under
mount
etna
fabricating
the
thunderbolts
of
jove
and
arms
for
the
gods
and
great
heroes
of
antiquity
the
pythagoreans
appear
to
have
held
the
doctrine
of
a
central
fire
meson
pyr
as
the
source
of
volcanic
phenomena
and
in
the
dialogues
of
plato
allusion
is
made
to
a
subterranean
reservoir
of
lava
which
according
to
simplicius
was
in
accordance
with
the
doctrine
of
the
pythagoreans
which
plato
was
recounting
thucydides
clearly
describes
the
effect
of
earthquakes
upon
of
the
grecian
archipelago
similar
to
that
which
took
place
in
the
case
of
the
earthquake
of
lisbon
the
sea
first
retiring
and
afterwards
inundating
the
shore
pliny
supposed
that
it
was
by
earthquake
avulsion
that
islands
were
naturally
formed
thus
sicily
was
torn
from
italy
cyprus
from
syria
euboea
from
boeotia
and
the
rest
but
this
view
was
previously
enunciated
by
aristotle
in
his
peri
kosmou
where
he
states
that
earthquakes
have
torn
to
pieces
many
parts
of
the
earth
while
lands
have
been
converted
into
sea
and
that
tracts
once
covered
by
the
sea
have
been
converted
into
dry
land
but
the
most
philosophical
views
regarding
terrestrial
phenomena
are
those
given
by
ovid
as
having
been
held
by
pythagoras
about
in
the
his
views
regarding
the
interchange
of
land
and
sea
the
effects
of
running
water
in
eroding
valleys
the
growth
of
deltas
the
effect
of
earthquakes
in
burying
cities
and
diverting
streams
from
their
sources
are
remarkable
anticipations
of
doctrines
now
generally
held
but
what
most
concerns
us
at
present
are
his
views
regarding
the
changes
which
have
come
over
volcanic
mountains
in
his
day
vesuvius
was
dormant
but
etna
was
active
so
his
illustrations
are
drawn
from
the
latter
mountain
and
in
this
connection
he
observes
that
volcanic
vents
shift
their
position
there
was
a
time
he
says
when
etna
was
not
a
burning
mountain
and
the
time
will
come
when
it
will
cease
to
burn
whether
it
be
that
some
caverns
become
closed
up
by
the
movements
of
the
earth
or
others
opened
or
whether
the
fuel
is
finally
exhausted
strabo
may
be
regarded
as
having
originated
the
view
now
generally
held
that
active
volcanoes
are
to
the
regions
in
which
they
are
situated
referring
to
the
tradition
recorded
by
pliny
that
sicily
was
torn
from
italy
by
an
earthquake
he
observes
that
the
land
near
the
sea
in
those
parts
was
rarely
shaken
by
earthquakes
since
there
are
now
orifices
whereby
fire
and
ignited
matters
and
waters
escape
but
formerly
when
the
volcanoes
of
etna
the
lipari
islands
ischia
and
others
were
closed
up
the
imprisoned
fire
and
wind
might
have
produced
far
more
violent
movements
the
account
of
the
first
recorded
eruption
of
vesuvius
has
been
graphically
related
by
the
younger
pliny
in
his
two
letters
to
tacitus
to
which
i
shall
have
occasion
to
refer
further
on
these
bring
down
the
references
to
volcanic
phenomena
amongst
ancient
authors
to
the
commencement
of
the
christian
era
from
all
of
which
we
may
infer
that
the
more
enlightened
philosophers
of
antiquity
had
a
general
idea
that
eruptions
had
their
origin
in
a
central
fire
within
the
interior
of
the
earth
that
volcanic
mountains
were
liable
to
become
dormant
for
long
periods
and
afterwards
to
break
out
into
renewed
activity
that
there
existed
a
connection
between
volcanic
action
and
earthquakes
and
that
volcanoes
are
for
the
regions
around
it
is
unnecessary
that
i
should
pursue
the
historical
sketch
further
those
who
wish
to
know
the
views
of
writers
of
the
middle
ages
will
find
them
recorded
by
sir
charles
lyell
the
long
controversy
carried
on
during
the
latter
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
between
neptunists
led
by
werner
on
the
one
side
and
vulcanists
led
by
hutton
and
playfair
on
the
other
regarding
the
origin
of
such
rocks
as
granite
and
basalt
was
finally
brought
to
a
close
by
the
triumph
of
the
vulcanists
who
demonstrated
that
such
rocks
are
the
result
of
igneous
fusion
and
that
in
the
cases
of
basalt
and
its
congeners
they
are
being
extruded
from
volcanic
vents
at
the
present
day
the
general
principles
for
the
classification
of
rocks
as
recognised
in
modern
science
may
be
regarded
as
having
been
finally
established
by
james
hutton
of
edinburgh
in
his
of
the
while
they
were
illustrated
and
defended
by
professor
playfair
in
his
work
entitled
of
the
huttonian
theory
of
the
although
other
observers
such
as
desmarest
collini
and
guettard
had
in
other
countries
come
to
very
clear
views
on
this
subject
the
following
are
some
of
the
more
important
works
on
the
phenomena
of
volcanoes
and
earthquakes
published
during
the
present
century
poulett
scrope
on
this
work
is
dedicated
to
lyell
his
in
the
same
department
of
science
and
was
undertaken
as
he
says
in
order
to
help
to
dispel
that
signal
delusion
as
to
the
mode
of
action
of
the
subtelluric
forces
with
which
the
theory
had
mystified
the
geological
world
the
second
edition
was
published
in
this
was
followed
by
the
admirable
work
the
extinct
volcanoes
of
central
published
in
edition
and
is
one
of
the
most
complete
monographs
on
a
special
volcanic
district
ever
written
samuel
hibbert
of
the
extinct
volcanoes
of
the
basin
of
neuwied
on
the
lower
hibbert
work
is
one
of
remarkable
merit
if
we
consider
the
time
at
which
it
was
written
for
not
only
does
it
give
a
clear
and
detailed
account
of
the
volcanic
phenomena
of
the
eifel
and
the
lower
rhine
but
it
anticipates
the
principles
upon
which
modern
writers
account
for
the
formation
of
river
valleys
and
other
physical
features
and
in
working
out
the
physical
history
of
the
rhine
valley
below
mainz
and
its
connection
with
the
extinct
volcanoes
which
are
found
on
both
banks
of
that
river
he
has
taken
very
much
the
same
line
of
reasoning
which
was
some
years
afterwards
adopted
by
sir
ramsay
when
dealing
with
the
same
subject
it
does
not
appear
that
the
latter
writer
was
aware
of
treatise
leopold
von

translated
from
the
original
by
boulanger
berlin
vols
and

a
large

on

by
this
distinguished
traveller
whom
alexander
von
humboldt
calls
dem
geistreichen
forscher

the
above
are
selected
as
being
the
most
important
that
on
the
canaries
is
accompanied
by
a
large
atlas
in
which
the
volcanoes
of
teneriffe
palma
and
lancerote
with
some
others
are
elaborately
represented
and
are
considered
to
bear
out
the
author
views
regarding
the
formation
of
volcanic
cones
by
elevation
or
upheaval
the
works
dealing
with
the
volcanic
phenomena
of
central
and
southern
italy
are
also
written
with
the
object
in
part
at
least
of
illustrating
and
supporting
the
same
theoretical
views
with
these
we
have
to
deal
in
the
next
chapter
charles

of

and

volcanoes
of

and
of

remarks
on

of

phenomena
the
character
of
their
respective
products
and
their

of

edition
in
this
work
the
author
gives
detailed
descriptions
of
almost
all
the
known
volcanic
districts
of
the
globe
and
defends
what
is
called
the
chemical
theory
of
volcanic
action
a
theory
at
one
time
held
by
sir
humphrey
davy
wolfgang
sartorius
von
waltershausen
this
work
possesses
a
melancholy
interest
from
the
fact
that
its
distinguished
author
did
not
live
to
see
its
publication
von
waltershausen
having
spent
several
years
in
making
an
elaborate
survey
of
etna
produced
an
atlas
containing
numerous
detailed
maps
views
and
drawings
of
this
mountain
and
its
surroundings
which
were
published
at
weimar
by
engelmann
in
a
description
in
to
accompany
the
atlas
was
also
prepared
but
before
it
was
printed
the
author
died
on
the
october
the
having
been
put
into
the
hands
of
the
late
professor
arnold
von
lasaulx
by
the
publisher
of
the
atlas
it
was
subsequently
brought
out
under
the
care
of
this
distinguished
petrologist
who

form
structure
and
composition
of
volcanic
mountains
the
conical
form
of
a
volcanic
mountain
is
so
generally
recognised
that
many
persons
who
have
no
intelligent
acquaintance
with
geological
phenomena
are
in
the
habit
of
attributing
to
all
mountains
having
a
conical
form
and
especially
if
accompanied
by
a
truncated
apex
a
volcanic
origin
yet
this
is
very
far
from
being
the
fact
as
some
varieties
of
rock
such
as
quartzite
not
unfrequently
assume
this
shape
of
such
we
have
an
example
in
the
case
of
errigal
a
quartzite
mountain
in
donegal
nearly
feet
high
which
bears
a
very
near
approach
in
form
to
a
perfect
cone
or
pyramid
and
yet
is
in
no
way
connected
as
regards
its
origin
or
structure
with
volcanic
phenomena
another
remarkable
instance
is
that
of
schehallion
in
scotland
also
composed
of
and
others
may
be
found
amongst
the
ranges
of
islay
and
jura
described
by
sir
a
geikie
notwithstanding
however
such
exceptions
which
might
be
greatly
multiplied
the
majority
of
mountains
over
the
globe
have
a
volcanic
origin
the
origin
of
this
form
in
each
case
is
entirely
distinct
in
the
case
of
quartzite
mountains
the
conical
form
is
due
to
atmospheric
influences
acting
on
a
rock
of
uniform
composition
traversed
by
numerous
joints
and
fissures
crossing
each
other
at
obtuse
angles
along
which
the
rock
breaks
up
and
falls
away
so
that
the
sides
are
always
covered
by
angular
shingle
forming
slopes
corresponding
to
the
angle
of
friction
of
the
rock
in
question
in
the
case
of
a
volcanic
mountain
however
the
same
form
is
due
either
to
accumulation
of
fragmental
material
piled
around
the
hollow
or
crater
which
is
usually
placed
at
the
apex
of
the
cone
and
owing
to
which
it
is
bluntly
terminated
or
else
to
the
welling
up
from
beneath
of
viscous
matter
in
the
manner
presently
to
be
described
of
sir
humphrey
davy
and
von
the
question
how
a
volcanic
cone
came
to
be
formed
was
not
settled
without
a
long
controversy
carried
on
by
several
naturalists
of
eminence
some
of
the
earlier
writers
of
modern
times
on
the
subject
of
vulcanicity
such
as
sir
humphrey
davy
and
leopold
von
buch
maintained
that
the
conical
form
was
due
to
upheaval
by
a
force
acting
from
below
at
a
central
focus
whereby
the
materials
of
which
the
mountain
is
formed
were
forced
to
assume
a
position
that
is
a
position
in
which
the
materials
dip
away
from
the
central
focus
in
every
direction
but
this
view
originally
contested
by
scrope
and
lyell
has
now
been
generally
abandoned
it
will
be
seen
on
reflection
that
if
a
series
of
strata
of
ashes
tuff
and
lava
originally
horizontal
or
nearly
so
were
to
be
forced
upwards
into
a
conical
form
by
a
central
force
the
result
would
be
the
formation
of
a
series
of
radiating
fissures
ever
widening
from
the
circumference
towards
the
focus
in
the
case
of
a
large
mountain
such
fissures
whether
filled
with
lava
or
otherwise
would
be
of
great
breadth
towards
the
focus
or
central
crater
and
could
not
fail
to
make
manifest
beyond
dispute
their
mechanical
origin
but
no
fissures
of
the
kind
here
referred
to
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
be
observed
those
which
do
exist
are
too
insignificant
and
too
irregular
in
direction
to
be
ascribed
to
such
an
origin
so
that
the
views
of
von
buch
and
davy
must
be
dismissed
as
being
unsupported
by
observation
and
as
untenable
on
dynamical
grounds
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
elevatory
theory
or
the
theory
as
it
is
called
by
scrope
has
been
almost
universally
abandoned
by
writers
on
vulcanicity
varieties
of
volcanic
mountains
as
regards
but
whilst
rejecting
the
elevatory
theory
it
is
necessary
to
bear
in
mind
that
volcanic
cones
and
elevations
have
been
formed
in
several
distinct
ways
giving
rise
to
varieties
of
structure
essentially
different
two
of
the
more
general
of
these
varieties
of
form
the
and
the
dome
are
found
in
some
districts
as
in
auvergne
side
by
side
the
consists
of
beds
or
sheets
of
ashes
lapilli
and
slag
piled
up
in
a
conical
form
with
a
central
crater
or
cup
containing
the
principal
pipe
through
which
these
materials
have
been
erupted
the
dome
of
a
variety
of
trachytic
lava
which
has
been
extruded
in
a
molten
or
viscous
condition
from
a
central
pipe
and
in
such
cases
there
is
no
distinct
crater
there
are
other
forms
of
volcanic
mountains
such
as
those
built
up
of
basaltic
matter
of
which
i
shall
have
to
speak
hereafter
but
the
two
former
varieties
are
the
most
prevalent
and
we
may
now
proceed
to
consider
the
conditions
under
which
the
volcanoes
have
been
formed
volcanic
of
this
class
nearly
all
the
active
volcanoes
of
the
mediterranean
region
etna
vesuvius
stromboli
and
the
lipari
islands
may
be
considered
as
representatives
they
consist
essentially
of
masses
of
fragmental
material
which
have
from
time
to
time
been
blown
out
of
an
orifice
and
piled
up
around
with
more
or
less
regularity
according
to
the
force
exerted
and
direction
of
the
prevalent
winds
alternating
with
sheets
of
lava
in
this
way
mountains
several
thousand
feet
in
height
and
of
vast
horizontal
extent
are
formed
the
fragmental
materials
thus
accumulated
are
of
all
sizes
from
the
finest
dust
up
to
blocks
many
tons
in
weight
the
latter
being
naturally
piled
around
nearest
to
the
orifice
the
fine
dust
blown
high
into
the
air
by
the
explosive
force
of
the
gases
and
vapours
is
often
carried
to
great
distances
by
the
prevalent
winds
thus
during
the
eruption
of
vesuvius
in
showers
of
ashes
carried
high
into
the
air
by
the
westerly
wind
fell
over
constantinople
at
a
distance
of
miles
these
loose
or
partially
consolidated
fragmental
materials
are
rudely
stratified
and
slope
downwards
and
outwards
from
the
edge
of
the
crater
so
as
to
present
the
appearance
of
what
is
known
as
the
dip
of
stratified
deposits
which
have
been
upraised
from
the
horizontal
position
by
terrestrial
forces
it
was
this
excentrical
arrangement
which
gave
rise
to
the
supposition
that
such
volcanic
had
been
tilted
up
by
a
force
acting
in
the
direction
of
the
volcanic
throat
or
orifice
of
eruption
the
interior
wall
of
monte
di
somma
the
original
crater
of
vesuvius
presents
a
good
illustration
of
such
fragmental
beds
i
shall
have
occasion
further
on
to
describe
more
fully
the
structure
of
this
remarkable
mountain
so
that
it
will
suffice
to
say
here
that
this
old
prehistoric
crater
the
walls
of
which
enclose
the
modern
cone
of
vesuvius
is
seen
to
be
formed
of
irregular
beds
of
ash
scoriæ
and
fragmental
masses
traversed
by
numerous
dykes
of
lava
and
sloping
away
outwards
towards
the
surrounding
plains
of
similar
materials
are
the
flanks
of
etna
composed
even
at
great
distances
from
the
central
crater
the
beds
of
ash
and
agglomerate
sometimes
alternating
with
sheets
of
solidified
lava
and
traversed
by
dykes
of
similar
material
of
later
date
injected
from
below
through
fissures
formed
during
periods
of
eruptive
energy
numerous
similar
examples
are
to
be
observed
in
the
auvergne
region
of
central
france
and
the
eifel
and
here
we
find
remarkable
cases
of
breached
cones
or
craters
which
will
require
some
special
description
standing
on
the
summit
of
the
puy
de
dôme
and
looking
northwards
or
southwards
the
eye
wanders
over
a
tract
formed
of
hills
and
of
extinct
rising
from
a
granitic
platform
but
what
is
most
peculiar
in
the
scene
is
the
ruptured
condition
of
a
large
number
of
the
cones
with
craters
in
such
cases
the
wall
of
the
crater
has
been
broken
down
on
one
side
and
we
observe
that
a
stream
of
lava
has
been
poured
out
through
the
breach
and
overflowed
the
plain
below
the
cause
of
this
breached
form
is
sufficiently
obvious
in
such
cases
there
has
been
an
explosion
of
ashes
stones
and
scoriæ
from
the
volcanic
throat
by
which
a
hill
with
a
crater
has
been
built
up
this
has
been
followed
by
molten
lava
welling
up
through
the
throat
and
gradually
filling
the
crater
but
as
the
lava
is
much
more
dense
than
the
material
of
which
the
crater
wall
is
composed
the
pressure
of
the
lava
outwards
has
become
too
great
for
the
resistance
of
the
wall
which
consequently
has
given
way
at
its
weakest
part
and
a
breach
being
formed
the
molten
matter
has
flowed
out
in
a
stream
which
has
inundated
the
country
lying
at
the
base
of
the
cone
in
one
instance
mentioned
by
scrope
the
original
upper
limit
of
the
lake
of
molten
lava
has
left
its
mark
in
the
form
of
a
ring
of
slag
on
the
inside
of
the
breached
crater
these
differ
essentially
both
in
form
and
composition
from
those
just
described
and
have
their
typical
representatives
in
the
auvergne
district
though
not
without
their
analogues
elsewhere
as
in
the
case
of
chimborazo
in
south

mountains

a

of
volcanic

and
destitute

being
rounded

slightly
flattened

also
observe
that
the

rise
more
abruptly
from
their
bases

in

and
being
piled
up

necessarily
assumes
such
a

as
that

as
has
been
shown
by

on
a
small

by

the
contrast
between
the
two
forms
those
of

and
the
is
exemplified
in
the
case
of

its
neighbours
the
former
is
composed
of
a
species
of
trachyte
the
latter
of
ashes
and
fragmental
matter
which
have
been
blown
out
of
their
respective
vents
of
eruption
into
the
air
and
piled
up
and
around
in
a
crateriform
manner
with
sides
of
gradually
diminishing
slope
outwards

giving

to
the
characteristic

the
two

in

and
colour
of
material
can
be
clearly
recognised
from
the

of
the
puy

which
rises
by
a
head
and
shoulders
above
its
fellows
and
thus
affords
an
advantageous
standpoint
from
which
to
compare
the
various
forms
of
this
remarkable
group
of
volcanic
mountains
cotopaxi
fig
has
been
generally
supposed
to
be

but
whymper
who
ascended

shows
that
it
is
a
cone
with
a
crater
feet
in
largest
diameter
he
determined
the
height
to
be
feet
above
the
ocean
its
real
elevation
above
the
sea
is
somewhat
masked
owing
to
the
fact
that
it
rises
from
the
high
plain
of
tapia
which
is
itself
feet
above
the
sea
surface
the
smaller

when
highly

trachyte
on

is

be

a

which
the

of

find

also
a
remarkable
example
of
the
linear
arrangement
of
volcanic
mountains
on
tracing
these
ranges
on
a
map
of
the
world
map
it
will
be
observed
that
they
are
either
strings
of
islands
or
lie
in
proximity
to
the
ocean
and
hence
the
view
was
naturally
entertained
by
some
writers
that
oceanic
water
or
at
any
rate
that
of
a
large
lake
or
sea
was
a
necessary
agent
in
the
production
of
volcanic
eruptions
this
view
seems
to
receive
further
corroboration
from
the
fact
that
the
interior
portions
of
the
continents
and
large
islands
such
as
australia
are
destitute
of
volcanoes
in
action
with
the
remarkable
exceptions
of
mounts
kenia
and
kilimanjaro
in
central
africa
and
a
few
others
it
is
also
very
significant
in
this
connection
that
many
of
the
volcanoes
now
extinct
or
at
least
dormant
both
in
europe
and
asia
appear
to
have
been
in
proximity
to
sheets
of
water
during
the
period
of
activity
thus
the
old
volcanoes
of
the
haurân
east
of
the
jordan
appear
to
have
been
active
at
the
period
when
the
present
jordan
valley
was
filled
with
water
to
such
an
extent
as
to
constitute
a
lake
two
hundred
miles
in
length
but
which
has
now
shrunk
back
to
within
the
present
limits
of
the
dead
sea
again
at
the
period
when
the
extinct
volcanoes
of
central
france
were
in
active
operation
an
extensive
lake
overspread
the
tract
lying
to
the

constituting

such
instances
are
too
significant
to
allow
us
to
doubt
that
water
in
some
form
is
very
generally
connected
with
volcanic
operations
but
it
does
not
follow
that
it
was
necessary
to
the
original
formation
of
volcanic
vents
whether
linear
or
sporadic
if
this
were
so
the
extinct
volcanoes
of
the
british
isles
would
still
be
active
as
they
are
close
to
the
and
no
volcano
would
now
be
active
which
is
not
near
to
some
large
sheet
of
water
but

one
of
the
great

a

magnitude

such
facts
as
these
all
tend
to
show
that
although
water
may
be
an
accessory
of
volcanic
eruptions
it
is
not
in
all
cases
essential
and
we
are
obliged
therefore
to
have
recourse
to
some
other
theory
of
volcanic
action
differing
from
that
which
would
attribute
it
to
the
access
of
water
to
highly
heated
or
molten
matter
within
the
crust
of
the
earth
von
buch
on
rents
and
fissures
in
the
the
view
of
leopold
von
buch
who
considered
that
the
great
lines
of
volcanic
mountains
above
referred
to
rise
along
the
borders
of
rents
or
fissures
in
the
earth
crust
is
one
which
is
inherently
probable
and
is
in
keeping
with
observation
that
the
crust
of
the
globe
is
to
a
remarkable
extent
fissured
and
torn
in
all
directions
is
a
phenomenon
familiar
to
all
field
geologists
such
rents
and
fissures
are
often
accompanied
by
displacement
of
the
strata
owing
to
which
the
crust
has
been
vertically
elevated
on
one
side
or
lowered
on
the
other
and
such
displacements
or
faults
sometimes
amount
to
thousands
of
feet
it
is
only
occasionally
however
that
such
fractures
are
accompanied
by
the
extrusion
of
molten
matter
and
in
the
north
of
england
and
scotland
dykes
of
igneous
rock
such
as
basalt
which
run
across
the
country
for
many
miles
in
nearly
straight
lines
often
cut
across
the
faults
and
are
only
rarely
coincident
with
them
nevertheless
it
can
scarcely
be
a
question
that
the
grand
chain
of
volcanic
mountains
which
stretches
almost
continuously
along
the
andes
of
south
america
and
northwards
through
mexico
has
been
piled
up
along
the
line
of
a
system
of
fissures
in
the
fundamental
rocks
parallel
to
the
coast
though
not
actually
coincident
therewith
cordilleras
of
the
structure
and
arrangement
of
the
cordilleras
of
quito
for
example
are
eminently
suggestive
of
arrangement
along
lines
of
fissure
as
shown
by
alexander
von
humboldt
the
volcanic
mountains
are
disposed
in
two
parallel
chains
which
run
side
by
side
for
a
distance
of
over
miles
northwards
into
the
state
of
columbia
and
enclose
between
them
the
high
plains
of
quito
and
lacunga
along
the
eastern
chain
are
the
great
cones
of
el

rising
to
an
elevation
of

dormant

huge

these
constitute
the

of

the

contains
even
loftier

we
find
the
gigantic

is

is
the
western

remarkable
for
its
straightness
the
volcanic

being
planted
in
one
grand
procession
from
south
to
north
this
rectilinear
arrangement
of
the
western
chain
only
a
little
less
conspicuous
in
the
eastern
is
very
suggestive
of
a
line
of
fracture
in
the
crust
beneath
and
when
we
contemplate
the
prodigious
quantity
of
matter
included
within
the
limits
of
these
colossal
domes
and
their
environments
all
of
which
has
been
extruded
from
the
internal
reservoirs
we
gain
some
idea
of
the
manner
in
which
the
contracting
crust
disposes
of
the
matter
it
can
no
longer
contain
between
the
volcanoes
of
quito
and
those
of
peru
there
is
an
intervening
space
of
fourteen
degrees
of
latitude
this
is
occupied
by
the
andes
regarding
the
structure
of
which
we
have
not
much
information
except
that
at
this
part
of
its
course
it
is
not
volcanic
but
from
arequipa
in

almost
continuous

with
that

to
chili
through
this
country
we
find
the
volcanic
range
appearing
at
intervals
and
still
more
to
the

it
is
doubtless
connected
with
the
volcanoes
of

david
forbes
considers
that
this
great
range
of
volcanic
mountains
lying
nearly
north
and
south
corresponds
to
a
line
of
fracture
lying
somewhat
to
the
east
of
the
range
volcanic
a
similar
statement
in
all
probability
applies
to
the
systems
of
volcanic
mountains
of
the
aleutian
isles
kamtschatka
the
kuriles
the
philippines
and
sunda
isles
nor
can
it
be
reasonably
doubted
that
the
western
american
has
to
a
great
extent
been
determined
or
marked
out
by
such
lines
of
displacement
for
as
darwin
has
shown
the
whole
western
coast
of
south
america
for
a
distance
of
between
and
miles
south
of
the
equator
has
undergone
an
upward
movement
in
very
recent
times
that
is
within
the
period
of
living
marine
shells
during
which
period
the
volcanoes
have
been
in
activity
kurile
this
chain
may
also
be
cited
in
evidence
of
volcanic
action
along
fissure
lines
it
connects
the
volcanoes
of
kamtschatka
with
those
of
japan
and
the
linear
arrangement
is
apparent
in
the
former
peninsula
erman
counted
no
fewer
than
thirteen
active
volcanic
mountains
rising
to
heights
of
to
feet
above
the
sea
in
the
chain
of
the
kuriles
professor
john
milne
counted
volcanoes
of
which
nine
perhaps
more
are
certainly
active
they
are
not
so
high
as
those
of
kamtschatka
but
on
the
other
hand
they
rise
from
very
deep
oceanic
waters
and
have
been
probably
built
up
from
the
sea
bottom
by
successive
eruptions
of
tuff
lava
and
ash
according
to
the
view
of
professor
milne
the
volcanoes
of
the
kurile
chain
are
fast
becoming
extinct
besides
the
volcanic
vents
arranged
in
lines
of
which
we
have
treated
above
there
are
a
large
number
both
active
and
extinct
which
appear
to
be
disposed
in
groups
or
sporadically
distributed
over
various
portions
of
the
earth
surface
i
say
to
because
this
sporadic
distribution
may
really
be
resolvable
at
least
in
some
cases
into
linear
distribution
for
short
distances
thus
the
neapolitan
group
which
might
at
first
sight
seem
to
be
arranged
round
vesuvius
as
a
centre
really
resolves
itself
into
a
line
of
active
and
extinct
vents
of
eruption
ranging
across
italy
from
the
tyrrhenian
sea
to
the
adriatic
through
ischia
procida
monte

and
the
phlegræan
fields
vesuvius
and
mount
vultur
again
the
extinct
volcanoes
of
central
france
which
appear
to
form
an
isolated
group
indicate
when
viewed
in
detail
a
linear
arrangement
ranging
from
north
to
south

these
are

the

is

the

are
those
which
are
overspread
by
the

of

these
are

but
are

pointed
out
all
the

of

from

the

are
those

there
has
never

of
more
than
forty
years
without

so
intense
is
the
volcanic
energy
in
this
island
that
some
of
the
eruptions
of

have
lasted
six
years
without

earthquakes
have
often
shaken
the
whole
island
at

great
changes
in
the
interior
such
as
the
sinking
down
of

the
rending
of

the
desertion
by
rivers
of
their
channels
and
the
appearance
of

have
often
been
thrown
up
near
the

north

the

partially
active
partially

it
must
be
supposed
however
that
at

is
the

more
precipitous
than
any

all

the
enormous

enables
these

to
stand
with
slopes
varying
from

than

it
is
on

lister
who
has

the

interest
not

from

at

to

from

respect

down

that
it

true
that
some
vague
tradition
that
the
mountain
once
gave
forth
fire
hovered
around
its
borders

several
ancient
writers
amongst
them

not

nevertheless
at
this
period
the

of
the

were
covered
by
fields
and
vineyards

the
summit
partially
enclosed
with
precipitous
walls
of
the
long
extinct
volcano

was
formed
of
slaggy
and
scoriaceous
material
with
probably
a
covering
of
scrub
here
it
was
that
the
gladiator
spartacus
stung
by
the
intolerable
evils
of
the
roman
government
retreated
to
the
very
summit
of
the
mountain
with
some
trusty
followers
clodius
the
prætor
according
to
the
narration
of
plutarch
with
a
party
of
three
thousand
men
was
sent
against
them
and
besieged
them
in
a
mountain
meaning
vesuvius
or
somma
having
but
one
narrow
and
difficult
passage
which
clodius
kept
guarded

twisted
them
into

enough
to
reach
from
thence
to
the
bottom
by
which
without
any

from
the

to

that

have
a
sudden
and
disastrous
close
earthquake
the
first
monitions
of
the
impending
catastrophe
occurred
in
the
year
after
christ
when
the
whole
campagna
was
shaken
by
an
earthquake
which
did
much
damage
to
the
towns
and

surrounding
the
mountain
even
beyond

this
was
followed
by
other
shocks
and
in

the
temple

isis
was
so
much
damaged
as
to
require
reconstruction
which
was
undertaken
and
carried
out
by
a
citizen
at

own
expense
these
earthquake
shakings
continued
for
sixteen
years
at
length
on
the
night
of
august
they
became
so
violent
that
the
whole
region
seemed
to
reel
and
totter
and
all
things
appeared
to
be
threatened
with
destruction
the
next
day
about
one
in
the
afternoon
there
was
seen
to
rise
in
the
direction
of
vesuvius
a
dense
cloud
which
after
ascending
from
the
summit
of
the
mountain
into
the
air
for
a
certain
height
in
one
narrow
vertical
trunk
spread
itself
out
laterally
in
such
a
form
that
the
upper
part
might
be
compared
to
the
cluster
of
branches
and
the
lower
to
the
stem
of
the
pine
which
forms
so
common
a
feature
in
the
italian
landscape
letters
to
for
an
account
of
what
followed
we
are
indebted
to
the
admirable
letters
of
the
younger
pliny
addressed
to
the
historian
tacitus
recounting
the
events
which
caused
or
accompanied
the
death
of
his
uncle
the
elder
pliny
who
at
the
time
of
this
first
eruption
of
vesuvius
was
in
command
of
the
roman
fleet
at
the
entrance
to
the
bay
of
naples
these
letters
which
are
models
of
style
and
of
accurate
description
are
too
long
to
be
inserted
here
but
he
recounts
how
the
dense
cloud
which
hung
over
the
mountain
spread
over
the
whole
surrounding
region
sometimes
illuminated
by
flashes
of
light
more
vivid
than
lightning
how
showers
of
cinders
stones
and
ashes
fell
in
such
quantity
that
his
uncle
had
to
flee
from
stabiæ
and
that
even
at
so
great
a
distance
as
misenum
they
encumbered
the
surface
of
the
ground
how
the
ground
heaved
and
the
bed
of
the
sea
was
upraised
how
the
cloud
descended
on
misenum
and
even
the
island
of
capreæ
was
concealed
from
view
and
finally
how
urged
by
a
friend
who
had
arrived
from
spain
he
with
filial
affection
supported
the
steps
of
his
mother
in
flying
from
the
city
of
destruction
such
being
the
condition
of
the
atmosphere
and
the
effects
of
the
eruption
at
a
point
so
distant
as
cape
misenum
some
sixteen
geographical
miles
from
the
focus
of
eruption
it
is
only
to
be
expected
that
places
not
half
the
distance
such
as
herculaneum
pompeii
and
even
stabiæ
with
many
villages
and
dwellings
should
have
shared
a
worse
fate
the
first
of
these
cities
situated
on
the
coast
of
the
bay
of
naples
appears
to
have
been
overwhelmed
by
volcanic
mud
pompeii
was
buried
in
ashes
and
lapilli
and
stabiæ
probably
shared
a
similar
fate
of
the
mountain
at
the
commencement
of
the
christian
at
the
time
of
the
first
recorded
eruption
vesuvius
appears
to
have
consisted
of
only
a
single
cone
with
a
crater
now
known
as
monte
di
somma
the
central
cone
of
eruption
which
now
rises
from
within
this
outer
ruptured
casing
not
having
been
formed
fig
the
first
effect
of
the
eruption
of
the
year
was
to
blow
out
the
solidified
covering
of
slag
and
scoriæ
forming
the
floor
of
the
caldron
doubtless
at
the
close
of
the
eruption
a
cone
of
fragmental
matter
and
lava
of
some
slight
elevation
was
built
up
and
if
so
was
subsequently
destroyed
for
as
we
shall
presently
see
by
the
testimony
of
the
abate
guilio
cesare
braccini
who
examined
the
mountain
not
long
before
the
great
eruption
of
there
was
no
central
cone
to
the
mountain
at
that
time
and
the
mountain
had
assumed
pretty
much
the
appearance
it
had
at
the
time
that
spartacus
took
refuge
within
the
walls
of
the
great
crater
of
pompeii
was
overwhelmed
with
dry
ashes
and
lapilli
sir
hamilton
found
some
of
the
stones
to
weigh
eight
pounds
at
the
time
of
the
author
visit
early
in
april
the
excavations
had
laid
open
a
section
about
ten
feet
deep
chiefly
composed
of
alternating
layers
of
small
pumice
stones
lapilli
and
volcanic
dust
it
was
during
the
sinking
of
a
well
in
upon
the
theatre
containing
the
statues
of
hercules
and
cleopatra
that
the
existence
of
the
ancient
city
was
accidentally
discovered
recent
since
the
first
recorded
eruption
in
down
to
the
present
day
vesuvius
has
been
the
scene
of
numerous
intermittent
eruptions
of
which
some
have
been
recorded
but
many
doubtless
are
forgotten
in
during
the
reign
of
severus
an
eruption
of
extraordinary
violence
took
place
which
is
related
by
dion
cassius
from
whose
narrative
we
may
gather
that
at
this
time
there
was
only
one
large
crater
and
that
the
central
cone
of
vesuvius
had
not
as
yet
been
upraised
in
an
eruption
occurred
of
such
magnitude
as
to
cover
all
europe
with
fine
dust
and
spread
alarm
even
at
constantinople
of
in
december
occurred
the
great
convulsion
whose
memorials
are
written
widely
on
the
western
face
of
vesuvius
in
ruined
villages
this
eruption
left
layers
of
ashes
over
hundreds
of
miles
of
country
or
heaps
of
mud
swept
down
by
hot
water
floods
from
the
crater
the
crater
itself
having
been
dissipated
in
the
convulsion
braccini
who
examined
the
mountain
not
long
before
this
eruption
found
apparently
no
cone
or
mount
like
that
of
the
modern
vesuvius
he
states
that
the
crater
was
five
miles
in
circumference
about
a
thousand
paces
deep
or
in
sloping
descent
and
its
sides
covered
with
forest
trees
and
brushwood
while
at
the
bottom
there
was
a
plain
on
which
cattle
grazed
it
would
seem
that
the
mountain
had
at
this
time
enjoyed
a
long
interval
of
rest
and
that
it
had
reverted
to
very
much
the
same
state
in
which
it
was
at
the
period
of
the
first
eruption
when
the
flanks
were
peopled
by
inhabitants
living
in
fancied
security
but
six
months
of
violent
earthquakes
which
grew
more
violent
towards
the
close
of
heralded
the
eruption
which
took
place
in
december
accompanied
by
terrific
noises
from
within
the
interior
of
the
mountain
the
inhabitants
of
the
coast
were
thus
warned
of
the
approaching
danger
and
had
several
days
to
arrange
for
their
safety
but
in
the
end
a
great
part
of
torre
del
greco
was
destroyed
and
a
like
fate
overtook
resina
and
granatello
with
a
loss
of
life
reported
at
persons
during
the
eruption
clouds
condensed
into
tempests
of
rain
and
hot
water
from
the
mountain
forming
deluges
of
mud
swept
down
the
sides
and
reached
even
to
nola
and
the
apennines
nor
was
the
sea
unmoved
it
retired
during
the
violent
earthquakes
and
then
returned
full
thirty
paces
beyond
its
former
limits
not
indeed
until
near
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
is
there
any
evidence
that
the
central
cone
of
vesuvius
was
in
existence
but
in
october
an
eruption
occurred
which
is
recorded
by
sorrentino
during
which
was
erected
a
new
mountain
within
and
higher
than
the
old
one
and
visible
from
naples
a
statement
evidently
referable
to
the
existing
cone
so
that
it
is
little
more
than
two
centuries
since
this
famous
volcanic
mountain
assumed
its
present
form
between
the
years
and
since
there
have
been
recorded
eruptions
of
vesuvius
one
of
these
in
was
of
terrific
violence
and
destructiveness
and
is
represented
by
sir
william
hamilton
in
views
taken
both
before
and
during
the
eruption
a
drawing
of
the
appearance
of
the
crater
before
the
eruption
is
here
reproduced
from
hamilton

from
which
it
will
be
seen
that
the
central
crater
contained
within
itself
a
second
from
whence
steam
lava
and
stones
were
being
erupted

thus
it
will
be
seen
that
vesuvius
at
this
epoch
consisted
of
three

without

until
we
come
down

our
own
times

which
vesuvius
has
resumed
its
old
character
and
in
one
grand
exhibition
of
volcanic
energy
which
took
place
in

evinced
to
the
world
that
it
still
contains
within

to

there
are
seen
two
minor
craters
within
the
central
one
formed
in
and
an
outflow
of
lava
from
the
down
the
cone
at
the
time
of
the
author
visit
the
crater
was
giving
indications
by
the
great
quantity
of
sulphurous
gas
and
vapour
rising
from
its
surface
and
small
jets
of
molten
lava
beginning
to
flow
down
the
outer
side
of
the
grand
outburst
of
internal
forces
which
was
presently
to
follow
of
the
grand
eruption
of
of
which
a
detailed
account
is
given
by
professor
palmieri
commenced
with
a
slight
discharge
of
incandescent
projectiles
from
the
crater
and
on
the
january
an
aperture
appeared
on
the
upper
edge
of
the
cone
from
which
at
first
a
little
lava
issued
forth
followed
by
the
uprising
of
a
cone
which
threw
out
projectiles
accompanied
by
smoke
whilst
the
central
crater
continued
to
detonate
more
loudly
and
frequently
this
little
cone
ultimately
increased
in
size
until
in
april
it
filled
the
whole
crater
and
rose
four
or
five
metres
above
the
brim
at
this
time
abundant
lavas
poured
down
from
the
base
of
the
cone
into
the
atria
del
cavallo
thence
turned
into
the
fossa
della
vetraria
in
the
direction
of
the
observatory
and
towards
the
crocella
where
they
accumulated
to
such
an
extent
as
to
cover
the
hillside
for
a
distance
of
about
metres
then
turning
below
the
canteroni
formed
a
hillock
without
spreading
much
farther
in
october
another
small
crater
was
formed
by
the
falling
in
of
the
lava
which
after
a
few
days
gave
vent
to
smoke
and
several
jets
of
lava
and
towards
the
end
of
october
the
detonations
increased
the
smoke
from
the
central
crater
issued
forth
more
densely
mixed
with
ashes
and
the
seismographical
apparatus
was
much
disturbed
on
the
and
november
copious
and
splendid
coursed
down
the
principal
cone
on
its
western
side
but
were
soon
exhausted
and
in
the
beginning
of
the
little
cone
regaining
vigour
began
to
discharge
lava
from
the
summit
instead
of
the
base
as
heretofore
in
the
month
of
march
with
the
full
moon
the
cone
opened
on
the
side
the
cleavage
being
indicated
by
a
line
of
fumaroles
and
lava
issued
from
the
base
and
poured
down
into
the
atria
as
far
as
the
precipices
of
monte
di
somma
on
the
april
another
full
moon
the
activity
of
the
craters
increased
and
on
the
evening
of
the
splendid
descended
the
cone
in
various
directions
attracting
on
the
same
night
the
visits
of
a
great
many
strangers
a
lamentable
event
followed
on
the
a
party
of
visitors
accompanied
by
inexperienced
guides
and
contrary
to
the
advice
of
professor
palmieri
insisted
on
ascending
to
the
place
from
which
the
lava
issued
at
three
on
the
morning
of
the
they
were
in
the
atria
del
cavallo
when
the
vesuvian
cone
was
rent
in
a
direction
and
a
copious
torrent
of
lava
issued
forth
two
large
craters
formed
at
the
summit
of
the
mountain
discharging
incandescent
projectiles
and
ashes
a
cloud
of
smoke
enveloped
the
unhappy
visitors
who
were
under
a
of
burning
projectiles
eight
were
buried
beneath
it
or
in
the
lava
while
eleven
were
grievously
injured
the
flowing
over
that
of
in
the
atria
divided
into
two
branches
the
smaller
one
flowing
towards
resina
but
stopping
before
reaching
the
town
the
larger
precipitated
itself
into
the
fossa
della
vetraria
occupying
the
whole
width
of
metres
and
traversing
the
entire
length
of
metres
in
three
hours
it
dashed
into
the
fossa
di
farone
and
reached
the
villages
of
massa
and
sebastiano
covering
a
portion
of
the
houses
and
continuing
its
course
through
an
artificial
foss
or
trench
invaded
cultivated
ground
and
several
villages
if
it
had
not
greatly
slackened
after
midnight
from
failure
of
supply
at
its
source
it
would
have
reached
naples
by
ponticelli
and
flowed
into
the
sea
the
eruption
towards
the
end
of
april
had
reached
its
height
the
observatory
ridge
was
bounded
on
either
side
by
two
fiery
streams
which
rendered
the
heat
intolerable
simultaneously
with
the
opening
of
the
great
fissure
two
large
craters
opened
at
the
summit
discharging
with
a
dreadful
noise
an
immense
cloud
of
smoke
and
ashes
with
bombs
which
rose
to
a
height
of
metres
above
the
brim
of
the
volcano
the
torrents
of
fire
which
threatened
resina
bosco
and
torre
annunziata
and
which
devastated
the
fertile
country
of
novelle
massa
sebastiano
and
cerole
and
two
partially
buried
cities
the
continual
thunderings
and
growling
of
the
craters
caused
such
terror
that
numbers
abandoned
their
dwellings
flying
for
refuge
into
naples
while
many
neapolitans
went
to
rome
or
other
places
fortunately
the
paroxysm
had
now
passed
the
stopped
in
their
course
and
the
great
torrent
which
passed
the
shoulders
of
the
observatory
through
the
fossa
della
vetraria
lowered
the
level
of
its
surface
below
that
of
its
sides
which
appeared
like
two
parallel
ramparts
above
it
had
these
streams
continued
to
flow
on
the
of
april
as
they
had
done
on
the
previous
night
they
would
have
reached
the
sea
bringing
destruction
to
the
very
walls
of
naples
during
this
eruption
torre
del
greco
was
upraised
to
the
extent
of
two
metres
and
nearly
all
the
houses
were
knocked
down
the
igneous
period
of
eruption
having
terminated
the
ashes
lapilli
and
projectiles
became
more
abundant
accompanied
by
thunder
and
lightning
on
the
they
darkened
the
air
and
the
terrific
noise
of
the
mountain
continuing
or
increasing
the
terror
at
resina
portici
and
naples
became
universal
it
seemed
as
though
the
tragic
calamities
of
the
eruption
of
were
about
to
be
repeated
but
gradually
the
force
of
the
explosions
decreased
and
the
noise
from
the
crater
became
discontinuous
so
that
on
the
the
detonations
were
very
few
and
by
the
may
the
eruption
was
completely
over
such
is
a
condensed
account
of
one
of
the
most
formidable
eruptions
of
our
era
in
the
frontispiece
of
this
volume
a
representation
taken
by
permission
from
a
photograph
by
negretti
zambra
is
given
showing
the
appearance
of
vesuvius
during
the
final
stage
of
the
eruption
when
prodigious
masses
of
smoke
steam
and
illuminated
gas
issued
forth
from
the
summit
and
overspread
the
whole
country
around
with
a
canopy
which
the
light
of
the
sun
could
scarcely
penetrate
it
will
be
noticed
in
the
above
account
that
concurrently
with
the
full
moon
there
were
two
distinct
and
special
outbreaks
of
activity
one
occurring
in
march
the
other
in
the
month
following
that
the
conditions
of
lunar
and
solar
attraction
should
have
a
marked
effect
on
a
part
of
the
earth
crust
while
under
the
tension
of
eruptive
forces
is
only
what
might
be
expected
at
full
moon
the
earth
is
between
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
at
new
moon
the
moon
is
between
the
sun
and
the
earth
under
these
conditions
the
two
bodies
acting
in
concert
we
have
spring
tides
in
the
ocean
and
a
maximum
of
attraction
on
the
mass
of
the
earth
hence
the
crust
which
at
the
time
referred
to
was
under
tremendous
strain
only
required
the
addition
of
that
caused
by
the
lunar
and
solar
attractions
to
produce
rupture
in
both
cases
giving
rise
to
increased
activity
and
the
extrusion
of
lava
and
volatile
matter
it
may
in
general
be
safely
affirmed
that
low
barometric
pressure
on
the
one
hand
and
the
occurrence
of
the
syzygies
when
the
attractions
of
the
sun
and
moon
are
in
the
same
line
on
the
other
have
had
great
influence
in
determining
the
crises
of
eruptions
of
volcanic
mountains
when
in
a
state
of
unrest
between
the
northern
and
southern
before
leaving
vesuvius
it
may
be
observed
that
throughout
all
the
eruptions
of
modern
times
the
northern
side
of
the
mountain
that
is
the
old
crater
and
flank
of
somma
has
been
secure
from
the
and
has
enjoyed
an
immunity
which
does
not
belong
to
the
southern
and
western
side
if
we
look
at
a
map
of
the
mountain
showing
the
direction
of
the
streams
during
the
last
three
centuries
we
observe
that
all
the
streams
of
that
period
flowed
down
on
the
side
overlooking
the
bay
of
naples
on
the
opposite
side
the
wall
of
monte
di
somma
presents
an
unbroken
front
to
the
from
this
it
may
be
inferred
that
one
side
the
west
is
weaker
than
the
other
and
consequently
when
the
lava
and
vapours
are
being
forced
upwards
under
enormous
pressure
from
beneath
the
western
side
gives
way
under
the
strain
as
in
the
case
of
the
fissure
of
and
the
lava
and
vapours
find
means
of
escape
from
what
has
happened
in
the
past
it
is
clear
that
no
place
on
the
western
side
of
the
mountain
is
entirely
safe
from
devastation
by
floods
of
lava
while
the
prevalent
winds
tend
to
carry
the
ashes
and
lapilli
which
are
hurled
into
the
air
in
the
same
westerly
direction

an
excellent
view

this
remarkable

had
the
advantage
of
a
personal
examination
of
this
region
of
so
large
is
etna
that
it
would
enclose
within
its
ample
skirts
several
cones
of

size
of

it
rises
to
a
height

nearly
feet

its
base
is
nearly
circular
and
has
a
circumference
of
english
miles
in
ascending
its
flanks
we
pass
successively
over
three
physical
zones
the
lowest
or
fertile
zone
comprising
the
tract
around
the
skirts
of
the
mountain
up
to
a
level
of
about
feet
being
well
cultivated
and
covered
by
dwellings
surrounded
by
olive
groves
fields
vineyards
and
the
second
or
forest
zone
extending
to
a
level
of
about
feet
clothed
with
chestnut
oak
beech
and
cork
trees
giving
place
to
pines
and
the
third
extending
to
the
summit
and
called
the
desert
region
a
waste
of
black
lava
and
scoriæ
with
mighty
crags
and
precipices
terminating
in
a
tableland
from
which
rises
the
central
cone
feet
high
emitting
continually
steam
and
sulphurous
vapours
and
in
the
course
of
almost
every
century
sending
forth
streams
of
molten
lava
the
forest
zone
is
remarkable
for
the
great
number
of
minor
craters
which
rise
up
from
the
midst
of
the
foliage
and
are
themselves
clothed
with
trees
sartorius
von
waltershausen
has
laid
down
on
his
map
of
etna
about
of
these
cones
and
craters
some
of
which
like
those
of
auvergne
have
been
broken
down
on
one
side
many
of
these
volcanoes
of
second
or
third
magnitude
lie
outside
the
forest
zone
both
above
and
below
it
such
as
the

formed
in
which
is
feet
in
height
and
two
miles
in
circumference
at
its
base
sir
lyell
observes
that
these
minor
present
us
with
one
of
the
most
delightful
and
characteristic
scenes
in
europe
they
occur
of
every
variety
of
height
and
size
and
are
arranged
in
picturesque
groups
however
uniform
they
may
appear
when
seen
from
the
sea
or
the
plains
below
nothing
can
be
more
diversified
than
their
shape
when
we
look
from
above
into
their
ruptured
craters
the
cones
situated
in
the
higher
parts
of
the
forest
zone
are
chiefly
clothed
with
lofty
pines
while
those
at
a
lower
elevation
are
adorned
with
chestnuts
oaks
and
beech
trees
these
cones
have
from
time
to
time
been
buried
amidst
fresh
descending
from
the
great
crater

thus
often
become

has
furnished
a
very
beautiful
plate
a
vast
amphitheatre
hewn
out

the
eastern

mountain
just
below
the
platform
it
is
a
physical
feature
somewhat
after
the
fashion
of
monte

in
vesuvius

exceeds
it
in
magnitude
as
etna
exceeds
vesuvius
the
val

about
five
miles
in

bounded
throughout
of
its
circumference
by
precipitous
walls
of
ashes

traversed
by
innumerable
dykes

rising
inwards
to
a
height
of
between
and
feet

the
east
the
cliffs
gradually
fall
to
a
height
of
about
feet

have
access
almost
to
the

heart
of

what
is
very
remarkable
about
the
structure
of

is
that
the
beds
exhibit
the
versal
dip
in
other
words
they
dip
away
on
all
sides
from
the
centre
which
has
led
to
the
conclusion
that
in
the
centre
is
a
focus
of
eruption
which
had
become
closed
up
antecedently
to

has
explained
this
point
very
clearly
by
showing
that
this
focus
had
ceased
to
eject
matter
at
some
distant
period
and
that
the
existing
crater
at
the
summit
of
the
mountain
had
poured
out
its
lavas
over
those
of
the
extinct
orifice
this
was
prior
to
the
formation
of
the
val
del
bove
itself
and
the
question
remains
for
consideration
how
this
vast
natural
amphitheatre
came
to
be
hollowed
out
for
its
structure
shows
unquestionably
that
it
owes
its
form
to
some
process
of
excavation
in
the
first
place
it
is
certainly
not
the
work
of
running
water
as
in
the
case
of
the
cañons
of
colorado
the
porous
matter
of
which
the
mountain
is
formed
is
quite
incapable
of
originating
and
supporting
a
stream
of
sufficient
volume
to
excavate
and
carry
away
such
enormous
masses
of
matter
within
the
period
required
for
the
purpose
we
must
therefore
have
recourse
to
some
other
agency
numerous
illustrations
are
to
be
found
of
the
explosive
action
of
volcanoes
in
blowing
off
either
the
summits
of
mountains
or
portions
of
their
sides
for
example
there
is
reason
for
believing
that
the
first
result
of
the
renewed
energy
of
vesuvius
was
to
blow
into
the
air
the
upper
surface
of
the
mountain
again
so
late
as
during
a
violent
earthquake
in
java
a
country
which
has
been
repeatedly
devastated
by
earthquakes
and
volcanic
eruptions
the
mountain
of
galongoon
which
was
covered
by
a
dense
forest
and
situated
in
a
fertile
and
region
and
had
never
within
the
period
of
tradition
been
in
activity
was
thus
ruptured
by
internal
forces
in
the
month
of
july
after
a
terrible
earthquake
an
explosion
was
heard
and
immense
columns
of
boiling
water
mixed
with
mud
and
stones
were
projected
from
the
mountain
like
a
and
in
falling
filled
up
the
valleys
and
covered
the
country
with
a
thick
deposit
for
many
miles
burying
villages
and
their
inhabitants
during
a
subsequent
eruption
great
blocks
of
basalt
were
thrown
to
a
distance
of
seven
miles
the
result
of
all
being
that
an
enormous
semicircular
gulf
was
formed
between
the
summit
and
the
plain
bounded
by
steep
cliffs
and
bearing
considerable
resemblance
to
the
val
del
bove
other
examples
of
the
power
of
volcanic
explosions
might
be
cited
but
the
above
are
sufficient
to
show
that
great
hollows
may
thus
be
formed
either
on
the
summits
or
flanks
of
volcanic
mountains
chasms
may
also
be
formed
by
the
falling
in
of
the
solidified
crust
owing
to
the
extrusion
of
molten
matter
from
some
neighbouring
vent
of
eruption
and
it
is
conceivable
that
by
one
or
other
of
these
processes
the
vast
chasm
of
the
val
del
bove
on
the
flanks
of
etna
may
have
been
produced
physical
history
of
the
physical
history
of
etna
seems
to
be
somewhat
as
follows
somewhere
towards
the
close
of
the
tertiary
period
perhaps
early
pliocene
or
late
miocene
a
vent
of
eruption
opened
on
the
floor
of
the
mediterranean
sea
from
which
sheets
of
lava
were
poured
forth
and
ashes
mingled
with
clays
and
sands
brought
down
from
the
neighbouring
lands
were
strewn
over
the
during
a
pause
in
volcanic
activity
beds
of
limestone
with
marine
shells
were
deposited
this
was
gradually
upraised
into
the
air
while
fresh
sheets
of
lava
and
other
were
accumulated
round
the
vents
of
eruption
of
which
there
were
two
principal
ones
the
older
under
the
present
val
del
bove
the
newer
under
the
summit
of
the
principal
cone
thus
was
the
mountain
gradually
piled
up
the
vent
under
the
val
del
bove
ceased
to
extrude
more
matter
and
became
extinct
meanwhile
the
second
vent
continued
active
and
piling
up
more
and
more
matter
round
the
central
crater
surmounted
the
former
vent
and
covered
its
with
newer
sheets
of
lava
ashes
and
lapilli
while
numerous
smaller
vents
scattered
all
over
the
sides
of
the
mountain
gave
rise
to
smaller
cones
and
craters
this
stage
is
signalised
by
the
formation
of
the
val
del
bove
through
some
grand
explosion
or
series
of
explosions
by
which
this
vast
chasm
was
opened
in
the
side
of
the
mountain
as
already
explained
this
represents
the
present
condition
of
the
mountain
whose
height
above
the
sea
is
due
not
only
to
accumulation
of
volcanic
materials
round
the
central
cone
but
to
elevation
of
the
whole
island
as
evinced
by
numerous
raised
beaches
of
gravel
and
sand
containing
shells
and
other
forms
of
marine
species
now
living
in
the
waters
of
the
mediterranean
since
then
the
condition
and
form
of
the
mountain
has
remained
very
much
the
same
varied
only
by
the
results
of
occasional
eruptions
in
the
constitution
of
the
lavas
of
etna
and
before
leaving
the
subject
we
have
been
considering
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
mention
one
remarkable
fact
connected
with
the
origin
of
the
lavas
of
etna
and
vesuvius
respectively
i
refer
to
their
essential
differences
in
mineral
composition
it
might
at
first
sight
have
been
supposed
that
the
lavas
of
these
two
volcanic
mountains
situated
at
such
a
short
distance
from
each
other
and
evidently
along
the
same
line
of
fracture
in
the
crust
would
be
of
the
same
general
composition
but
such
is
not
the
case
in
the
lava
of
vesuvius
leucite
is
an
essential
and
perhaps
the
most
abundant
mineral
it
is
called
by
zirkel
see
plate
iv
but
in
that
of
etna
this
mineral
is
as
far
as
i
am
aware
altogether
absent
we
have
fortunately
abundant
means
of
comparison
as
the
lavas
of
these
two
mountains
have
been
submitted
to
close
examination
by
petrologists
in
the
case
of
the
vesuvian
lavas
an
elaborate
series
of
chemical
analyses
and
microscopical
observations
have
been
made
by
the
rev
professor
haughton
of
dublin
university
and
the
author
from
specimens
collected
by
professor
guiscardi
from
the
extending
from
to
in
every
one
of
which
leucite
occurs
generally
as
the
most
abundant
mineral
always
as
an
essential
constituent
on
the
other
hand
the
composition
of
the
lavas
of
etna
determined
by
professor
von
lasaulx
from
specimens
taken
from
the
oldest
vorätnäischen
sheets
of
lava
down
to
those
of
the
present
day
indicates
a
rock
of
remarkable
uniformity
of
composition
in
which
the
components
are
plagioclase
felspar
augite
olivine
magnetite
and
sometimes
apatite
but
of
leucite
we
have
no
trace
in
fact
the
lavas
of
etna
are
very
much
the
same
in
composition
as
the
ordinary
basalts
of
the
british
isles
while
those
of
vesuvius
are
of
a
different
type
this
seems
to
suggest
an
origin
of
the
two
sets
of
lavas
from
a
different
magma
the
presence
of
leucite
in
such
large
quantity
requiring
a
magma
in
which
soda
is
in
excess
as
compared
with
that
from
which
the
lavas
of
etna
have
been
derived

the

a
brief
account
of
this
remarkable
group
of
volcanic
islands
must
here
be
given
inasmuch
as
they
seem
to
be
representatives
of

stage
of
volcanic
action
in
which
the
igneous
forces
are
gradually
losing
their
energy

to

to
be
developed
along
two
lines

at

of

of

but
by
far
the
most
remarkable
island
of
the
group
as
regards
its
present
volcanic
condition
is
stromboli
which
has
ever
been
in
active
eruption
from
the
commencement
of
history
down
to
the
present
day
professor
judd
who
visited
this
island
in
and
has
produced
a
striking
representation
of
its
aspect
gives
an
account
of
which
i
shall
here
avail
myself
the
island
is
of
rudely
circular
outline
and
rises
into
a
cone
the
summit
of
which
is
feet
above
the
level
of
the
mediterranean
from
a
point
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
masses
of
vapour
are
seen
to
issue
and
these
unite
to
form
a
cloud
over
the
summit
the
outline
of
this
varying
continually
according
to
the
hygrometric
state
of
the
atmosphere
and
the
direction
and
force
of
the
wind
at
the
time
of
professor
judd
visit
the
was
spread
in
a
great
horizontal
stratum
overshadowing
the
whole
island
but
it
was
clearly
seen
to
be
made
up
of
a
number
of
globular
masses
each
of
which
is
a
product
of
a
distinct
outburst
of
volcanic
forces
viewed
at
stromboli
presents
a
far
more
striking
and
singular
spectacle
when
watched
from
the
deck
of
a
vessel
a
glow
of
red
light
is
seen
to
make
its
appearance
from
time
to
time
above
the
summit
of
the
mountain
it
may
be
observed
to
increase
gradually
in
intensity
and
then
as
gradually
to
die
away
after
a
short
interval
the
same
appearances
are
repeated
and
this
goes
on
till
the
increasing
light
of
dawn
causes
the
phenomenon
to
be
no
longer
visible
the
resemblance
presented
by
stromboli
to
a
flashing
light
on
a
most
gigantic
scale
is
very
striking
and
the
mountain
has
long
been
known
as
the
lighthouse
of
the
mediterranean
the
mountain
is
built
up
of
ashes
slag
and
scoriæ
to
a
height
of
as
already
stated
over
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
sea
but
as
professor
judd
observes
this
by
no
means
gives
a
just
idea
of
its
vast
bulk
soundings
in
the
sea
surrounding
the
island
show
that
the
bottom
gradually
shelves
around
the
shores
to
a
depth
of
nearly
fathoms
so
that
stromboli
is
a
great
conical
mass
of
cinders
and
slaggy
materials
having
a
height
above
its
floor
of
about
feet
and
a
base
the
diameter
of
which
exceeds
four
miles
the
crater
of
stromboli
is
situated
not
at
the
apex
of
the
cone
but
at
a
distance
of
feet
below
it
the
explosions
of
steam
accompanied
by
the
roaring
as
of
a
smelting
furnace
or
of
a
railway
engine
when
blowing
off
its
steam
are
said
by
judd
to
take
place
at
very
irregular
intervals
of
time
varying
from
less
than
one
minute
to
twenty
minutes
or
even
more
on
the
other
hand
hoffmann
describes
them
as
occurring
at
perfectly
regular
intervals
so
that
perhaps
some
variation
has
taken
place
within
the
interval
of
about
forty
years
between
each
observation
both
observers
agree
in
stating
that
lava
is
to
be
seen
welling
up
from
some
of
the
apertures
within
the
crater
and
pouring
down
the
slope
towards
the
sea
which
it
seldom
or
never
reaches
the
intermittent
character
of
these
eruptions
appears
to
be
due
as
scrope
has
suggested
to
the
exact
proportion
between
the
expansive
and
repressive
forces
the
expansive
force
arising
from
the
generation
of
a
certain
amount
of
aqueous
vapour
and
of
elastic
gas
the
repressive
from
the
pressure
of
the
atmosphere
and
from
the
weight
of
the
superincumbent
volcanic
products
steam
is
here
as
in
a
not
the
originating
agent
in
the
phenomena
recorded
but
the
result
of
water
coming
in
contact
with
molten
lava
constantly
welling
up
from
the
interior
by
which
it
is
converted
into
steam
which
from
time
to
time
acquires
sufficient
elastic
force
to
produce
the
eruptions
the
water
being
obviously
derived
from
the
surrounding
sea
which
finds
its
way
by
filtration
through
fissures
or
through
the
porous
mass
of
which
the
mountain
is
formed
were
it
not
for
the
access
of
water
this
volcano
would
probably
appear
as
a
extruding
a
small
and
continuous
stream
of
molten
lava
the
adventitious
access
of
the
sea
water
gives
rise
to
the
phenomena
of
intermittent
explosions
the
vitality
of
the
volcano
is
therefore
due
not
to
the
presence
of
water
but
to
the
welling
up
of
matter
from
the
internal
reservoir
through
the
throat
of
the
volcano
this
island
lying
between
the
coast
of
sicily
and
cape
bon
in
africa
is
wholly
volcanic
it
has
a
circumference
of
thirty
miles
and
from
its
centre
rises
an
extinct
to
a
height
of
about
feet
the
flanks
of
this
volcano
are
diversified
by
several
fresh
craters
and
while
hot
springs
burst
out
with
a
hissing
noise
on
its
southern
flank
showing
that
molten
matter
lies
below
at
no
very
great
depth
this
island
probably
lies
along
the
dividing
line
between
the
and
volcanic
region
of
the
mediterranean
and
is
consequently
liable
to
intermittent
eruptions
it
was
at
a
short
distance
from
this
island
that
the
remarkable
submarine
outburst
of
volcanic
forces
took
place
on
october
for
an
account
of
which
we
are
indebted
to
colonel
c
mackowen
on
that
day
after
a
succession
of
earthquake
shocks
the
inhabitants
were
startled
by
observing
a
column
of
smoke
rising
out
of
the
sea
at
a
distance
of
three
miles
in
a
direction
the
governor
francesco
valenza
having
manned
a
boat
rowed
out
towards
the
fiery
column
and
on

before

it
is
necessary
to
give
some
account
of
the
remarkable
volcanic
island
of
santorin
in
the
grecian

this
island
for
years
has
been
the
scene
of
active
volcanic
operations
and
in
its
outline
and
configuration
both
below

of

presents
the
aspect
of
a
partially

volcanic
mountain
see

fig
if
for
example
we
can
imagine
the
waters
of
the
sea
to
rise
around
the
flanks
of
vesuvius
until
they
have
entered
and
overflowed
to
some
depth
the

of
somma
thus
converting
the
old
crater
into
a
island
and
the
cone
of
vesuvius
into
an
island
or
group
of
islands
within
the
caldron
then
we
shall
form
some
idea
of
the
appearance
and
structure
of
the
santorin
group
of
the
the
principal
island
thera
has
somewhat
the
shape
of
a
crescent
breaking
off
in
a
precipitous
cliff
on
the
inner
side
but
on
the
outer
side
sloping
at
an
angle
of
about
fifteen
degrees
into
deep
water
continuing
the
curvature
of
the
crescent
but
separated
by
a
channel
is
the
island
of
therasia
and
between
this
and
the
southern
promontory
of
thera
is
another
island
called
aspronisi
all
these
islands
if
united
would
form
the
rim
of
a
crater
in
which
the
volcanic
matter
slopes
outward
into
deep
water
descending
at
a
short
distance
to
a
depth
of
fathoms
and
upwards
in
the
centre
of
the
gulf
thus
formed
rise
three
islands
called
the
old
new
and
little
kaimenis
these
may
be
regarded
as
cones
of
eruption
which
history
records
as
having
been
thrown
up
at
successive
intervals
according
to
pliny
the
year
gave
birth
to
old
kaimeni
also
called
hiera

the
sacred
isle
and
in
the
first
year
of
our
era
thera
the
divine
made
its
appearance
above
the
water
and
was
soon
joined
to
the
older
island
by
subsequent
eruptions
old
kaimeni
also
increased
in
size
by
the
eruptions
of
and
a
century
and
a
half
later
in
another
eruption
produced
the
cone
and
crater
called
thus
were
formed
or
rather
were
rendered
visible
above
the
water
the
central
craters
of
eruption
and
between
these
and
the
inner
cliff
of
thera
and
therasia
is
a
ring
of
deep
water
descending
to
a
depth
of
over
fathoms
so
that
were
these
islands
raised
out
of
the
sea
we
should
have
presented
to
our
view
a
magnificent
circular
crater
about
six
miles
in
diameter
bounded
by
nearly
vertical
walls
of
rock
from
to
feet
in
height
and
ruptured
at
one
point
from
the
centre
of
which
would
rise
two
volcanic
cones

one
with

from

most

compare
with
the
santorin
group
of
the

in
reference
to
the
origin
of
the
santorin

lyell
regards
it
as
a
remnant
of
a
great
volcanic
mountain
which
possessed
a
focus
of
eruption
rising
in
the
position
of
the
present
foci
but
afterwards
partially
destroyed
and
the
whole
submerged
to
a
depth
of
over
feet
but
another
explanation
is
open
to
us
and
one
not
inconsistent
with
what
we
now
know
of
the
physical
changes
to
which
the
mediterranean
has
been
subjected
since
early
tertiary
times
to
my
mind
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
how
such
a
volcanic
mountain
as
that
of
santorin
could
have
been
formed
under
water
while
on
the
other
hand
its
physical
structure
and
contour
bear
so
striking
a
resemblance
as
already
observed
to
those
of
vesuvius
and
rocca
monfina
that
we
are
much
tempted
to
infer
that
it
had
a
somewhat
similar
origin
now
we
know
that
vesuvius
was
built
up
by
means
of
successive
eruptions
taking
place
under
the
air
and
the
question
arises
whether
it
could
be
possible
that
santorin
had
a
similar
origin
owing
to
the
waters
of
the
mediterranean
having
been
temporally
lowered
at
a
later
tertiary
epoch
it
has
been
stated
by
fouqué
that
the
age
of
the
more
ancient
volcanic
beds
of
santorin
belong
as
shown
by
the
included
fossils
to
the
newer
pliocene
epoch
these
are
of
course
the
unsubmerged
and
therefore
more
recent
strata
and
may
have
been
recently
upheaved
during
one
or
more
of
the
outbursts
of
volcanic
energy
but
it
seems
an
impossibility
that
the
gulf
of
santorin
with
its
precipitous
walls
and
deep
circular
interior
channel
as
shown
by
the
ideal
section
fig
could
have
been
formed
otherwise
than
under
the
air
we
are
led
therefore
to
inquire
whether
there
was
a
time
in
the
history
of
the
mediterranean
since
the
eocene
period
when
the
waters
were
lower
than
at
present
that
this
was
the
case
we
have
clear
evidence
the
remains
of
elephants
hippopotami
and
other
animals
which
have
been
discovered
in
great
numbers
in
the
maltese
caves
show
that
this
island
was
united
to
sicily
and
this
again
to
europe
during
the
later
pliocene
epoch
so
as
to
have
become
the
abode
of
an
europasian
fauna
according
to
wallace
a
causeway
of
dry
land
existed
stretching
from
italy
to
tunis
in
north
africa
through
the
maltese
islands
an
inference
involving
the
lowering
of
the
waters
of
the
mediterranean
by
several
hundred
feet
there
is
every
reason
for
supposing
that
the
old
volcano
of
santorin
was
in
active
eruption
at
this
period
and
its
history
may
be
considered
to
be
similar
to
that
of
vesuvius
until
at
the
rising
of
the
waters
during
the
pluvial
or
epoch
during
which
they
rose
higher
than
at
present
santorin
was
converted
into
a
group
of
islands
slightly
differing
in
form
from
those
of
the
present
day
this
view
seems
to
meet
the
difficulties
regarding
the
origin
of
this
group
difficulties
which
lyell
had
long
since
clearly
recognised
of
the
mediterranean
volcanic
with
the
santorin
group
we
conclude
our
account
of
the
active
european
volcanoes
it
may
be
observed
however
that
from
some
cause
not
ascertained
the
volcanic
districts
of
the
mediterranean
and
its
shores
are
confined
to
the
north
side
of
that
great
inland
sea
so
that
as
regards
vulcanicity
the
african
coast
presents
a
striking
contrast
to
that
of
the
opposite
side
if
we
draw
a
line
from
the
shores
of
the
levant
to
the
straits
of
gibraltar
by
candia
malta
and
to
the
south
of
pantelleria
and
sardinia
we
shall
find
that
the
volcanic
islands
and
districts
of
the
mainland
lie
to
the
north
of
it
this
has
doubtless
some
connection
with
the
internal
geological
structure
the
immunity
of
the
libyan
desert
from
volcanic
irruptions
is
in
keeping
with
the
remarkably
undisturbed
condition
of
the
secondary
strata
which
seldom
depart
much
from
the
horizontal
position
while
the
igneous
rocks
of
the
atlas
mountains
are
probably
of
great
geological
antiquity
on
the
other
hand
the
secondary
and
tertiary
formations
of
the
northern
shores
and
islands
of
the
mediterranean
are
generally
characterised
by
the
flexured
and
folded
position
of
the
strata
hence
we
may
suppose
that
the
crust
over
the
region
lying
to
the
north
of
the
volcanic
line
owing
to
its
broken
and
ruptured
condition
was
less
able
to
resist
the
pressure
of
the
internal
forces
of
eruption
than
that
lying
to
the
south
of
it
and
that
in
consequence
vents
and
fissures
of
eruption
were
established
over
the
former

alternating
with

ferriferous

it

sometimes
sufficiently
firm

the
roman

largely
formed
of
similar
materials
which
were
deposited
at
a
time

the

in

were
submerged
and
matter
was
being
erupted
from
volcanic
vents
at
various
points
around
and
spread
over
the
such
is
the
character
of
the
general
floor
on
which
the
more
recent

have
been
built
these
are
numerous
and
all

the
exception
of

with
a
minute
quantity

this
district
is
also
remarkable
for
containing
several
lakes
occupying
the
interiors
of
extinct

amongst
others
lake
avernus
which
owing
to
its
surface
having
been
darkened
by
forests
and
in
consequence
of
the
effluvia
arising
from
its
stagnant
waters
has
had
imparted
to
it
a
character
of
gloom
and
terror
so
that

makes
it
the
entrance
to
hell
and
describes
the
visit
of

follows
in
his
steps
another
lake
of
similar
origin
is
lake
agnano
here
also
is
the
grotto
del
cane
a
cavern
from
which
are
constantly
issuing
volumes
of
carbonic
acid
gas
combined
with
much
aqueous
vapour
which
is
condensed
by
the
coldness
of
the
external
air
thus
proving
the
high
temperature
of
the
ground
from
which
the
gaseous
vapour
issues
this
whole
volcanic
region
so
replete
with
objects
of
interest
may
be
considered
as
regards
its
volcanic
character
in
a
moribund
condition
but
that
it
is
still
capable
of
spasmodic
movement
is
evinced
by
the
origin
of

concur
in

as
will
clearly
appear
from
the
following
account
the
geological
structure
of
the
valley
of
the

at
rome
is
very
clearly
described
by
professor
ponzi
in
a
memoir
published
in
from
which
the
accompanying
section
is
taken
fig
from
this
it
will
be
seen
that
the
city
is
built
upon
promontories
of
stratified
volcanic
tuff
of
which
the
campagna
is
formed
breaking
off
along
the
banks
of
the
tiber
the
hills
being
the
result
of
the
erosion
or
denudation
of
the
strata
along
the
side
of
the
river
valley
as
the
strata
dip
from
west
to
east
across
the
course
of
the
river
it
follows
that
those
on
the
western
banks
are
below
those
on
the
opposite
side
and
thus
the
marine
sands
and
marls
which
underlie
the
volcanic
tuff
and
are
concealed
by
it
along
the
eastern
side
of
the
valley
emerge
on
the
west
and
form
the
range
of
hills
on
that
side
such
being
the
structure
of
the
formations
under
rome
it
is
evident
that
it
is
not
built

this

does

of
a
fuller
description
of
the
remarkable
volcanic
features
of
the
tract
lying
along
the
western
slope
of
the
apennines
but
from
what
has
been
stated
it
will
be
clear
that
volcanic
forces
have
been
in
operation
at
one
time
on
a
grand
scale
in
the
roman
states
and
the
south
of
tuscany
over
a
tract
extending
from
mount
annato
to
velletri
and
segni
this
tract
was
separated
from
that
of
the
neapolitan
volcanic
region
by
a
range
of
limestone
hills
of
jurassic
age
between
segni
and
gaeta
a
protrusion
of
the
alban
hills
westward
but
the
general
structure
and
physical
history
of
both
regions
are
probably
very
similar
with
the
exception
that
the
igneous
forces
still
retain
their
vitality
in
the
more
southerly
region
in
the
case
of
the
roman
volcanic
district
a
bay
seems
to
have
been
formed
about
the
close
of
the
miocene
period
bounded
on
all
sides
but
the
west
by
hills
of
limestone
over
whose
bed
strata
of
marl
sandstone
and
conglomerate
were
deposited
this
tract
was
converted
by
subsequent
movements
into
a
lake
and
contemporaneously
volcanic
operations
commenced
over
the
whole
region
and
beds
of
tuff
often
containing
blocks
of
rock
ejected
from
neighbouring
craters
were
deposited
over
those
of
marine
origin
meanwhile
numerous
were
thrown
up
and
as
the
land
gradually
rose
the
waters
of
the

were
drained
off
leaving
dry
the
campagna
and

of
the
tiber
ultimately
the
volcanic
fires
smouldered
down
and
died
out
whether
within
the
historic
epoch
or
not
is
uncertain
lakes
were
formed
within
the
now
dormant
craters
and
the
face
of
nature
gradually
assumed
a
more
placid
and
less
forbidding
aspect
over
this
memorable
region
destined
to
be

as
and
this
great
lake
occupying
a
hollow
in
the
old
granitic
platform
of
central
france
must
have
been
in
existence
for
an
extensive
period
which
mm
pomel
aymard
and
lyell
all
unite
in
referring
to
that
of
the
lower
miocene
but
what
is
to
us
of
special
interest
is
the
fact
that
in
the
deposits
of
this
lake
of
the
haute
loire
with
the
exception
of
the
very
latest
there
is
no
intermixture
of
volcanic
products
such
as
might
have
been
expected
to
occur
if
the
neighbouring
volcanoes
had
been
in
activity
during
its
existence
hence
it
may
be
supposed
that
as
scrope
suggested
the
waters
of
the
lake
were
drained
off
owing
to
the
disturbance
in
the
levels
of
the
country
caused
by
the
first
explosions
of
the
auvergne
volcanoes
if
this
be
so
then
we
possess
a
key
by
which
to
determine
the
period
of
the
first
formation
of
volcanoes
in
central
france
for
as
the
animal
remains
enclosed
in
the
lacustrine
deposits
of
the
vale
of
clermont
belong
to
the
early
miocene
stage
and
the
earliest
traces
of
contemporaneous
volcanic
are
found
only
in
the
uppermost
deposits
we
may
conclude
that
the
first
outburst
of
volcanic
action
occurred
towards
the
close
of
the
miocene
period
a
period
remarkable
for
similar
exhibitions
of
internal
igneous
action
in
other
parts
of
the
world
stages
of
volcanic
action
in
the
volcanic
region
here
described
which
has
an
area
of
about
one
hundred
square
miles
does
not
appear
to
have
been
at
one
and
the
same
period
of
time
the
theatre
of
volcanic
action
over
its
whole
extent
on
the
contrary
this
action
appears
to
have
commenced
at
the
southern
border
of
the
region
in
the
cantal
and
travelling
northwards
to
have
broken
out
in
the
mont
dore
region
finally
terminating
its
outward
manifestations
among
the
craters
and
domes
of
the
puy
de
dôme
in
a
similar
manner
the
volcanic
eruptions
of
the
haute
loire
and
ardèche
lying
to
the
eastward
and
separated
from
those
of
the
cantal
by
the
granitoid
ridge
of
the
montagnes
de
margeride
belong
to
two
successive
periods
referable
very
closely
to
those
of
the
mont
dore
and
the
puy
de

groups
the
evidence
in
support
of
this
view
is
very
clear
and
conclusive
for
while
the
volcanic
craters
formed
of
ash
lapilli
and
scoriæ
together
with
the
rounded
domes
of
trachytic
rock
of
which
the

group
is
composed

the
form
and

indications
of
recently
extinguished
volcanoes
those
which
we
may
assume
to
have
been
piled
up
in
the
region
of
mont
dore
and
cantal
have
been
entirely
swept
away
by
prolonged
rain
and
river
action
and
the
sites
of
the
ancient
craters
and
cones
of
eruption
are
only
to
be
determined
by
tracing
the
great
sheets
of
lava
up
the
sides
of
the
valleys
to
their
sources
generally
situated
at
the
culminating
points
of
their
respective
groups
other
points
of
evidence
of
the
great
antiquity
of
the
latter
groups
might
be
adduced
from
the
extent
of
the
erosion
which
has
taken
place
in
the
sheets
of
lava
having
their
sources
in
the
vents
of
the
plomb
du
cantal
and
of
mont
dore
owing
to
which
magnificent
valleys
many
miles
in
length
and
hundreds
of
feet
in
depth
have
been
cut
out
of
these
sheets
of
lava
and
their
supporting
rocks
whether
granitic
or
lacustrine
and
the
materials
carried
away
by
the
streams
which
flow
along
their
beds
these
points
will
be
better
understood
when
i
come
to
give
an
account
of
the
several
groups
and
in
doing
so
i
will
commence
with
that
of
the
cantal

the
the
original
of
this
group
have
entirely
disappeared
throughout
the
long
ages
which
have
elapsed
since
the
issued
forth
from
their
internal
reservoirs
the
general
figure
of
this
group
of
volcanic
mountains
is
that
of
a
depressed
cone
whose
sides
slope
away
in
all
directions
from
the
central
heights
which
are
deeply
eroded
by
streams
rising
near
the
apex
and
flowing
downwards
in
all
directions
towards
the
circumference
of
the
mountain
where
they
enter
the
lot

dordogne
and
the
allier
the
orifice
of
eruption
was
situated
at
the

formed
of
solid

of
trachyte
which
owing
as
scrope
supposes
to
a
high
degree
of
fluidity
were
able
to
extend
to
great
distances
in
extensive
sheets
and
were
afterwards
covered
by
repeated
and
flows
of
basalt
so
that
the
trachyte
towards
the
margin

along

of

are

towards
the
about

where
lacustrine
strata
overlie
the

the

which
rises
the
volcanic

is
composed
of
granitic
or
gneissose
rocks
accompanying
the
are
great
beds
of
volcanic
agglomerate
which
scrope
considers
to
have
been
formed
contemporaneously
with
the
lava
which
they
envelop
and
to
be
due
to
torrents
of
water
tumultuously
descending
the
sides
of
the
volcano
at
periods
of
eruption
and
bearing
down
immense
volumes
of
its
fragmental
in
company
with
its
nowhere
throughout
this
region
do
beds
of
trachyte
and
basalt
alternate
with
one
another
in
all
cases
the
basalt
is
the
newer
of
the
two
varieties
of
rock
and
this
is
generally
the
case
throughout
the
region
here
described
of
mont
this
mountain
lies
to
the
north
of
that
of
cantal
and
somewhat
resembles
it
in
general
structure
and
configuration
like
cantal
it
is
destitute
of
any
distinct
crater
all
that
is
left
of
the
central
focus
of
eruption
being
the
solidified
matter
which
filled
the
throat
of
the
original
volcano
and
which
forms
a
rocky
mass
of
lava
rising
in
its
highest
point
the
pic
de
saucy
to
an
elevation
as
given
by
ramond
of
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
thus
exceeding
that
of
the
plomb
du
cantal
by
feet
its
figure
will
be
best
understood
by
supposing
seven
or
eight
rocky
summits
grouped
together
within
a
circle
of
about
a
mile
in
diameter
from
whence
as
from
the
apex
of
an
irregular
and
flattened
cone
all
the
sides
slope
more
or
less
rapidly
downwards
until
their
inclination
is
gradually
lost
in
the
plain
around
this
mass
has
been
deeply
eroded
on
opposite
sides
by
the
valleys
of
the
dordogne
and
chambon
while
it
is
further
furrowed
by
numerous
minor
streams
the
great
beds
of
volcanic
rock
disposed
as
above
stated
consist
of
prodigious
layers
of
scoriæ
and
detritus
alternating
with
beds
of
trachyte
and
basalt
which
often
descend
in
uninterrupted
currents
till
they
reach
the
granite
platform
and
then
spread
themselves
for
miles
around
the
sheets
of
basalt
are
found
to
stretch
to
greater
distances
than
those
of
trachyte
and
have
flowed
as
far
as
or
miles
from
their
orifices
of
eruption
while
in
some
cases
on
the
east
and
north
sides
they
have
extended
as
far
as
or
miles
from
the
central
height
on
the
other
hand
a
radius
of
about
ten
miles
from
the
centre
would
probably
include
all
the
streams
of
trachyte
so
much
greater
has
been
the
viscosity
of
the
basalt
over
the
latter
rock
some
portions
of
these
great
sheets
of
lava
cut
off
by
river
valleys
or
eroded
areas
from
the
main
mass
of
which
they
once
formed
a
part
are
found
forming
isolated
terraces
and
plateaux
either
on
the
granitic
platform
or
resting
on
the
strata
of
the
valley
of
the
allier
while
in
a
northern
direction
they
overspread
a
large
portion
of
the
granitic
plateau
from
which
rise
the
puy
de
dôme
and
associated
volcanic
mountains
still
more
remarkable
are
the
cases
in
which
these
have
descended
into
the
old
river
channels
which
drained
the
granitic
plateau
thus
the
current
which
took
its
origin
in
the
puy
gros
descended
into
the
valley
of
the
dordogne
while
another
stream
invaded
the
gorge
of
champeix
on
the
eastern
side
the
more
ancient
just
described
are
invaded
by
currents
and
surmounted
by
cones
of
eruption
of
more
recent
date
similar
to
those
of
the
puy
de
dôme
group
lying
to
the
northward
such
cones
and
currents
amongst
which
are
the
puy
de
tartaret
and
that
of
montenard
present
exactly
the
same
characters
as
those
of
this
group
to
which
we
shall
return
further
on
of
the
haute
loire
and
separated
by
the
valley
of
the
allier
and
the
granitic
ridge
of
la
margeride
from
the
volcanic
regions
of
cantal
and
mont
dore
is
another
volcanic
region
of
great
extent
which
reaches
its
highest
elevation
in
the
central
points
of
mont
mezen
attaining
an
elevation
according
to
cordier
of
feet
and
formed
of
clinkstone
the
volcanic
products
of
mezen
have
been
erupted
from
one
central
orifice
of
vast
size
and
consist
mainly
of
extensive
sheets
of
clinkstone
a
variety
of
trachytic
lava
which
have
taken
courses
mainly
towards
the
and
these
great
sheets
one
of
which
appears
to
have
covered
a
space
more
than
miles
in
length
with
an
average
breadth
of
miles
thus
overspreading
an
estimated
area
of
square
miles
has
been
deeply
eroded
by
streams
draining
into
the
loire
along
whose
banks
the
rocks
tower
in
lofty
cliffs
while
it
has
also
suffered
enormous
denudation
by
which
outlying
fragments
are
disconnected
from
the
main
mass
and
form
hills
and
plateaux
as
far
distant
as
roche
en
reigner
and
beauzac
at
the
extreme
distance
as
stated
above
of
miles
from
the
source
of
eruption
but
even
more
remarkable
than
the
above
are
the
vast
basaltic
sheets
which
stretch
away
for
a
distance
of
miles
by
privas
almost
to
the
banks
of
the
rhône
opposite
montlimart
these
have
their
origin
amongst
the
clinkstone
heights
of
mont
mezen
and
taking
their
course
along
the
granitic
plateau
in
a
direction
ultimately
pass
over
on
to
the
jurassic
and
cretaceous
formations
composing
the
plateau
of
the
coiron
which
break
off
in
vertical
cliffs
from
to
feet
in
height
surmounting
the
slopes
that
rise
from
the
banks
of
the
ardèche
and
escourtais
rivers
near
villeneuve
de
bere
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
extensive
sheets
of
basalt
with
which
we
are
acquainted
in
the
european
area
and
it
is
only
a
remnant
of
a
vastly
greater
original
sheet

mont

near
le

seen
from
the
after

human

were
found
volcanoes
of
the
haute
loire
the
velay
and
vivarais
subsequently
to
the
formation
of
the
above
described
and
probably
after
the
lapse
of
a
lengthened
period
the
region
of
the
haute
loire
and
ardèche
became
the
scene
of
a
fresh
outburst
of
volcanic
action
during
which
the
surface
of
the
older
lavas
or
of
the
fundamental
granite
was
covered
by
numerous
and
strewn
along
the
banks
of
the
allier
and
of
the
loire
for
many
miles
these
cones
and
craters
are
not
quite
so
fresh
as
those
of
the
mont
dôme
group
those
of
the
haute
loire
being
slightly
earlier
in
point
of
time
and
as
daubeny
shows
belonging
to
a
different
system
so
numerous
are
these
more
recent
cones
and
craters
that
scrope
counted
more
than
of
them
and
probably
omitted
many
the
volcanic
phenomena
now
described
have
a
special
interest
as
bearing
on
the
question
whether
man
was
an
inhabitant
of
this
region
at
the
time
of
these
later
eruptions
the
question
seems
to
be
answered
in
the
affirmative
by
the
discovery
of
a
human
skull
and
several
bones
in
the
volcanic
breccia
of
mont
demise
in
company
with
remains
of
the
elephant
rhinoceros
stag
and
other
large
mammifers
the
discovery
of
these
remains
was
made
in
the
year
and
the
circumstances
were
fully
investigated
and
reported
upon
by
aymard
and
afterwards
by
poulett
scrope
upon
whose
mind
no
possible
doubt
of
the
fact
remained
from
what
we
now
know
of
the
occurrence
of
human
remains
and
works
of
art
in
other
parts
of
france
and
europe
no
surprise
need
be
felt
at
the
occurrence
of
human
remains
in
company
with
some
extinct
mammalia
in
these
volcanic
tuffs
which
belong
to
the
or
superficial
alluvia
antecedent
to
the
historic
period
dôme
we
now
come
to
the
consideration
of
the
most
recent
of
all
the
volcanic
mountain
groups
of
the
region
of
central
france
that
of
the
puy
de
dôme
lying
to
the
north
of
mont
dore
and
cantal
we
have
seen
that
there
is
almost
conclusive
evidence
that
man
was
a
witness
to
the
later
volcanic
outbursts
of
the
vivarais
and
as
these
craters
seem
to
be
of
somewhat
earlier
date
than
those
of
the
puy
de
dôme
group
we
can
not
doubt
that
they
were
in
active
eruption
when
human
beings
inhabited
the
country
and
not
improbably
within
what
is
known
as
the
no
mention
however
is
made
either
by
cæsar
pliny
or
other
roman
writers
of
the
existence
of
active
volcanoes
in
this
region
cæsar
who
was
a
close
observer
and
who
carried
the
roman
arms
into
auvergne
makes
no
mention
of
such
nor
yet
does
the
elder
pliny
who
enumerated
the
known
burning
mountains
of
his
day
all
over
the
roman
empire
it
is
not
till
we
come
down
to
the
fifth
century
of
our
era
that
we
find
any
notices
which
might
lead
us
to
infer
the
existence
of
volcanic
action
in
central
france
this
is
the
letter
written
by
sidonius
apollonarius
bishop
of
auvergne
to
alcinus
avitus
bishop
of
vienne
in
which
the
former
refers
to
certain
terrific
terrestrial
manifestations
which
had
occurred
in
the
diocese
of
the
latter
but
as
daubeny
observes
this
is
no
evidence
of
volcanic
action
in
auvergne
where
sidonius
himself
resided
the
terrestrial
disturbances
above
referred
to
may
have
been
earthquake
shocks
of
extreme
severity
but
although
we
have
no
reliably
historical
record
of
volcanic
action
amongst
the
mountains
of
the
mont
dôme
group
the
fact
that
these
are
comparatively
extremely
recent
will
be
evident
to
an
observer
visiting
this
district
and
this
conclusion
is
based
on
three
principal
grounds
first
because
of
the
forms
of
the
original
craters
though
generally
composed
of
very
loose
material
such
as
ashes
lapilli
and
slag
secondly
because
of
the
freshness
of
the
over
whose
rugged
surfaces
even
a
scanty
herbage
has
in
some
places
scarcely
found
a
footing
and
thirdly
because
the
lava
from
the
has
invaded
channels
previously
occupied
by
the
earlier
lavas
or
those
which
had
been
eroded
since
the
overflow
of
the
great
basaltic
sheets
of
mont
dore
still
as
in
the
case
of
the
valleys
of
lake
aidot
of
channonat
and
of
royat
these
streams
are
sufficiently
ancient
to
have
given
time
for
the
existing
rivers
to
have
worn
out
in
them
channels
of
some
depth
but
bearing
no
comparison
to
the
great
valleys
which
had
been
eroded
out
of
the
more
ancient
lavas
such
as
those
of
the
coiron
of
the
ardèche
and
of
the
dordogne
and
chambon
in
the
district
of
mont
dore
volcanic
i
have
previously
page
referred
to
the
two
classes
of
volcanic
eminences
to
be
found
in
the
chain
of
the
puy
de
dôme
one
indicated
by
the
name
itself
formed
of
a
variety
of
trachytic
lava
called
domite
and
of
the
form
of
a
dome
the
other
composed
of
fragmental
matter
piled
up
in
the
form
of
a
crater
or
cup
often
ruptured
on
one
side
by
a
stream
of
lava
which
has
burst
through
the
side
owing
to
its
superior
density
of
the
former
class
the
puy
de
dôme
and
the
grand
sarcoui
see
fig
are
the
most
striking
examples
out
of
the
five
enumerated
by
scrope
while
there
is
a
large
number
altogether
belonging
to
the
latter
class
these
domes
and
as
already
stated
rise
from
a
platform
of
granite
either
directly
or
from
one
formed
of
the
of
the
mont
dore
region
which
in
turn
overlies
the
granitic
platform
of
the
nearly
perfect
craters
there
are
the
petit
puy
de
dôme
lying
partially
against
the
northern
flank
of
the
greater
eminence
the
puy
de
cone
remarkable
for
the
symmetry
of
its
conical
form
rising
to
a
height
of
feet
from
the
plain
and
the
puys
de
chaumont
and
thiolet
lying
to
the
north
of
the
puy
de
dôme
of
those
to
the
south
of
this
mount
two
out
of
the
three
craters
of
the
puy
de
barme
and
the
puy
de
vichatel
are
perfect
but
most
of
the
south
of
the
puy
de
dôme
are
breached
some
of
the
lava
streams
by
which
these
craters
were
broken
down
flowed
for
long
distances
that
the
lava
followed
the
showers
of
ashes
and
lapilli
forming
the
walls
of
the
craters
is
rendered
very
evident
in
the
case
of
the
puy
de
la
vache
whose
coalescing
with
those
from
the
puy
de
la
solas
and
puy
noir
deluged
the
surrounding
tracts
and
flowed
down
the
channonat
valley
as
far
as
la
roche
blanc
in
the
vale
of
clermont
in
the
interior
of
the
upper
part
of
the
crater
still
remaining
may
be
seen
the
level
so
to
speak
to
which
the
molten
lava
rose
before
it
burst
its
barrier
this
level
is
marked
by
a
projecting
platform
of
reddish
or
yellow
material
rich
in
specular
iron
apparently
part
of
the
frothy
scum
which
formed
on
the
surface
of
the
lava
and
adhered
to
the
side
of
the
basin
at
the
moment
of
its
being
emptied
space
does
not
permit
a
fuller
description
of
this
remarkable
assemblage
of
extinct
volcanoes
and
the
reader
must
be
referred
for
further
details
to
the
work
of
scrope
i
shall
content
myself
with
some
further
reference
to
the
central
figure
in
this
grand
chain
the
puy
de
dôme
itself
of
the
puy
de
on
ascending
by
the
winding
path
up
the
steep
side
of
the
mount
and
on
reaching
the
somewhat
flattened
summit
the
first
objects
which
strike
the
eye
are
the
massive
foundations
of
the
roman
temple
of
mercury
they
are
hewn
out
of
solid
grey
lava
altogether
different
from
the
rock
of
the
puy
de
dôme
itself
which
must
have
been
obtained
from
one
of
the
of
the
mont
dore
group
to
have
carried
these
large
blocks
to
their
present
must
have
cost
no
little
labour
and
effort
the
temple
is
supposed
to
have
been
surmounted
by
a
colossal
statue
of
the
winged
deity
visible
from
all
parts
of
the
surrounding
country
which
was
dedicated
to
his
honour
and
the
foundations
were
only
discovered
a
few
years
ago
when
excavating
for
the
foundation
of
the
observatory
which
stands
a
little
further
on
under
the
charge
of
professor
janssen
on
proceeding
to
the
northern
crest
of
the
platform
a
wonderful
view
of
the
extinct
craters
and
domes
about
forty
in
number
and
terminating
in
the
puy
de
beauny
the
most
northerly
member
of
the
chain
is
presented
to
the
spectator
to
the
right
is
the
vale
of
clermont
and
the
rich
valley
of
the
allier
merging
into
the
great
plain
of
central
france
on
the
south
side
of
the
platform
a
no
less
remarkable
spectacle
meets
the
eye
the
chain
of
puys
and
broken
craters
stretches
away
southwards
for
a
distance
of
nearly
ten
miles
while
the
horizon
is
bounded
in
that
direction
by
the
lofty
masses
of
the
mont
dore
cantal
and
le
puy
ranges
nor
does
it
require
much
effort
of
the
imagination
to
restore
the
character
of
the
region
when
these
now
dormant
volcanoes
were
in
full
activity
projecting
showers
of
ashes
and
stones
high
into
the
air
amidst
flames
of
fire
and
vast
clouds
of
incandescent
gas
and
steam
the
material
of
which
the
puy
de
dôme
is
formed
consists
of
a
light
grey
nearly
white
soft
felsitic
lava
containing
crystals
of
mica
hornblende
and
specular
it
is
highly
vesicular
and
was
probably
extruded
in
a
pasty
condition
from
a
throat
piercing
the
granitic
plateau
and
the
overlying
sheet
of
ancient
lava
of
mont
dore
it
has
been
suggested
that
such
highly
felsitic
and
acid
lavas
as
that
of
which
the
puy
de
dôme
the
grand
sarcoui
and
cliersou
are
composed
may
have
had
their
origin
in
the
granite
itself
melted
and
rendered
viscous
by
intense
heat
gordon
hull
has
suggested
that
the
domite
hills
owing
to
their
low
specific
gravity
may
have
filled
up
craters
of
ashes
and
scoriæ
without
rupturing
them
as
in
the
case
of
the
heavier
basaltic
lavas
and
then
still
continuing
to
be
extruded
may
have
entirely
enveloped
them
in
its
mass
so
that
each
domite
hill
encloses
within
its
interior
a
crater
formed
of
ashes
stones
and
scoriæ
in
the
case
of
the
puy
de
dôme
there
is
some
evidence
that
the
domite
matter
rests
on
a
basis
of
ashes
and
scoriæ
which
may
be
seen
in
a
few
places
around
the
base
of
the
cone
it
is
difficult
without
some
such
theory
as
this
to
explain
how
a
viscous
mass
was
able
to
raise
mountains
some
or
feet
above
the
surrounding
plain
of
the
volcanic
history
of
central
it
now
only
remains
to
give
a
brief
of
the
volcanic
history
of
this
region
as
it
may
be
gathered
from
the
relations
of
the
rocks
and
strata
to
the
volcanic
products
and
of
these
latter
to
each
other
it
would
appear
that
at
the
close
of
the
eocene
period
great
terrestrial
changes
occurred
the
bed
of
the
sea
was
converted
into
dry
land
the
strata
were
flexured
and
denuded
and
a
depression
was
formed
in
the
granitic
floor
of
central
france
which
in
the
succeeding
miocene
period
was
converted
into
an
extensive
lake
peopled
by
molluscs
fishes
reptiles
and
pachyderms
of
the
period
towards
the
close
of
the
miocene
epoch
volcanic
eruptions
commenced
on
a
grand
scale
over
the
granitic
platform
in
the
districts
now
called
mont
dore
cantal
and
the
vivarais
vast
sheets
of
trachytic
and
basaltic
lavas
successively
invaded
the
tracts
surrounding
the
central
orifices
of
eruption
now
constituting
the
more
ancient
of
the
of
the
auvergne
region
and
invading
the
waters
of
the
neighbouring
lake
overspread
the
lacustrine
deposits
which
were
being
accumulated
therein
these
volcanic
eruptions
probably
continued
throughout
the
pliocene
period
interrupted
by
occasional
intervals
of
inactivity
and
ultimately
altogether
ceased
towards
the
close
of
the
pliocene
period
terrestrial
movements
took
place
owing
to
which
the
waters
of
the
lake
began
to
fall
away
and
the
sheets
of
lava
were
subjected
to
great
denudation
this
process
probably
accelerated
by
excessive
rainfall
during
the
succeeding
and
pluvial
periods
was
continued
until
plains
and
extensive
were
eroded
out
of
the
sheets
of
lava
and
their
supporting
granitic
rocks
and
the
adjoining
lacustrine
strata
a
new
outburst
of
volcanic
forces
marks
this
stage
during
which
the
chain
of
the
puy
de
dôme
was
thrown
up
on
the
west
and
that
of
the
newer
cones
of
the
vivarais
on
the
of
the
lacustrine
tract
the
waters
of
the
lake
were
now
completely
drained
away
through
the
channel
of
the
allier
and
denudation
extending
down
to
the
present
day
began
over
the
area
now
forming
the
vale
of
clermont
and
adjoining
districts
the
volcanic
action
ultimately
spent
its
force
and
somewhere
about
the
time
of
the
appearance
of
man
the
mammoth
rhinoceros
stag
and
reindeer
on
the
scene
eruptions
entirely
ceased
and
gradually
the
region
assumed
those
conditions
of
repose
by
which
it
is
now
physically
characterised
the
literature
referring
to
this
region
is
very
extensive
guettard
in
afterwards
faujas
published
descriptions
of
the
rocks
of
the
vivarais
and
velay
and
desmarest
geological
map
published
in
is
a
work
of
great
merit
the
district
was
afterwards
described
by
daubeny
lyell
von
buch
and
others
but
by
far
the
most
complete
work
is
that
of
scrope
entitled
of
central
containing
maps
and
numerous
illustrations
published
in
and
republished
in
a
more
extended
form

to
this

am
largely
indebted
a
monument
to
pascal
erected
by
the
citizens
occupies
the
centre
of
the
square
in
clermont
it
will
be
remembered
that
pascal
verified
the
conclusions
arrived
at
by
torricelli
regarding
the
pressure
of
the
atmosphere
by
carrying
a
torricellian
tube
to
the
summit
of
the
puy
de
dôme
and
recording
how
the
mercury
continually
fell
during
the
ascent
and
rose
as
he
descended
this
experiment
was
made
in
in
this
visit
to
auvergne
in
the
summer
of
the
author
was
accompanied
by
his
son
gordon
hull
and
sir
robert
ball
on
reaching
the
station
at
the
summit
of
the
ridge
it
seemed
as
if
the
volcanic
fires
had
again
been
lighted
for
the
whole
sky
was
aglow
with
the
rays
of
the
western
sun
on
the
other
hand
certain
beds
of
ash
and
other
volcanic
occur
in
strata
of
lake
deposits
of
limagne
so
that
these
may
indicate
the
commencement
of
the
period
of
eruption
as
suggested
further
on
only
very
closely
for
scrope
considers
that
the
of
the
chain
of
the
haute
loire
give
evidence
of
a
somewhat
earlier
epoch
of
activity
than
those
of
the
puy
de
dôme
as
they
have
undergone
a
greater
amount
of
subaerial
erosion
the
extent
of
this
river
erosion
has
been
clearly
brought
out
by
scrope
and
is
admirably
illustrated
by
several
of
his
panoramic

yet
from
what
lyell
states
in
his
of
it
will
be
seen
that
he
found
it
impossible
to
identify
its
position
or
to
determine
beyond
question
that
its
interment
was
due
to
natural
causes
but
assuming
this
to
be
the
case

shows

the
volcanic
district
of
the
rhine
valley
the
region
bordering
the
rhine
along
both
its
banks
above
bonn
and
extending
thence
along
the
valley
of
the
moselle
and
into
the
eifel
has
been
the
theatre
of
active
volcanic
phenomena
down
into
recent
times
but
at
the
present
day
the
volcanoes
are
dormant
or
extinct
the
fundamental
rocks
of
this
region
belong
to
the
silurian
devonian
and
carboniferous
systems
consisting
of
schists
grits
and
limestones
with
occasional
horizontal
beds
of
miocene
sandstone
and
shale
with
lignite
resting
on
the
upturned
edges
of
the
older
rocks
scattered
over
the
greater
part
of
the
district
here
referred
to
are
a
number
of
conical
eminences
often
with
craters
the
bottoms
of
which
are
usually
sunk
much
below
the
present
level
of
the
country
and
thus
receiving
the
surface
drainage
have
been
converted
into
little
lakes
called
maars
differing
from
ordinary
lakes
by
their
circular
form
and
the
absence
of
any
outlet
for
their
waters
but
before
entering
into
details
it
may
be
desirable
to
present
the
reader
with
a
short
outline
of
the
physical
history
of
the
region
which
has
been
ably
done
by
hibbert
in
his
treatise
to
which
i
have
already
referred
so
as
to
enable
him
better
to
understand
the
succession
of
physical
events
in
its
volcanic
history
illustration
fig
sketch
map
to
show
the
physical
condition
of
the
rhenish
area
in
the
miocene
after
hibbert
from
the
wide
distribution
of
stratified
deposits
of
sand
and
clay
at
high
levels
on
both
banks
of
the
rhine
north
of
the
moselle
it
would
appear
that
an
extensive
basin
which
hibbert
calls
the
basin
of
neuwied
occupied
a
considerable
tract
on
both
banks
in
the
centre
of
which
the
present
city
of
neuwied
stands
this
basin
was
bounded
towards
the
south
by
the
slopes
of
the
hündsruck
and
taunus
which
at
the
time
here
referred
to
formed
a
continuous
chain
of
mountains
fig
to
the
south
of
this
chain
lay
the
tertiary
basin
of
mayence
which
was
connected
at
an
early
period
that
of
the
miocene
with
the
waters
of
the
ocean
as
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
lower
strata
contain
marine
shells
these
afterwards
gave
place
to
conditions
the
basin
of
neuwied
was
bounded
towards
the
north
by
a
ridge
of
devonian
strata
which
extended
across
the
present
gorge
of
the
rhine
between
andernach
and
linz
and
to
the
north
of
this
barrier
lay
another
more
extensive
basin
that
of
cologne
from
this
it
will
be
seen
that
the
rhine
as
we
now
find
it
had
then
only
an
infantile
existence
in
fact
its
waters
to
the
south
of
the
hündsruck
ridge
drained
away
towards
the
south
but
towards
the
commencement
of
the
pliocene
period
the
barriers
of
the
hündsruck
and
taunus
as
also
that
of
the
linz
were
broken
through
and
the
course
of
the
waters
was
changed
and
thus
gradually
as
the
river
deepened
its
bed
the
waters
were
drained
off
from
the
great
lakes
this
rupture
of
the
barriers
may
have
been
due
in
the
first
instance
to
the
terrestrial
disturbances
accompanying
the
volcanic
eruptions
of
the
eifel
and
siebengebirge
though
the
erosion
of
the
gorges
at
bingen
and
at
linz
to
their
present
depth
and
dimensions
is
of
course
due
to
prolonged
river
action
it
was
about
the
epoch
we
have
now
arrived
at
the
close
of
the
miocene
that
volcanic
action
burst
forth
in
the
region
of
the
lower
rhine
it
is
probable
that
this
action
commenced
in
the
district
of
the
siebengebirge
and
afterwards
extended
into
that
of
the
moselle
and
the
eifel
the
volcanoes
of
which
bear
evidence
of
recent
date
layers
of
trachytic
tuff
are
interstratified
with
the
deposits
of
sand
clay
and
lignite
of
the
formation
known
as
that
of
the
brown
coal
of
miocene
age
which
underlies
nearly
the
whole
of
the
volcanic
district
on
both
sides
of
the
rhine
near
bonn
thus
showing
that
volcanic
action
had
already
commenced
in
that
part
to
some
extent
but
it
does
not
appear
from
hibbert
statement
that
any
such
fragments
of
eruptive
rock
are
to
be
found
in
the
strata
which
were
deposited
over
the
floor
of
the
neuwied
basin
it
will
be
recollected
that
the
epoch
assigned
for
the
earliest
volcanic
eruptions
of
auvergne
was
that
here
inferred
for
those
of
the
lower
rhine
the
close
of
the
miocene
stage
and
from
evidence
subsequently
to
be
adduced
from
other
european
districts
it
will
be
found
that
there
was
a
very
widely
spread
outburst
of
volcanic
action
at
this
epoch
range
of

this
range

of
the
older
volcanic
rocks

the

rises
along
the
right
bank
of
this
noble
river
opposite
bonn
where
it
leaves
the
narrow
gorge
which
it
traverses
all
the
way
from
bingen
and
opens
out
on
the
broad
plain
of
northern
germany
the

consists
of
a
succession
of
conical
hills
sometimes
as
in
the
case
of
petersberg
and
at
the

near
the
centre
of
the

it
presents
to
the

a
bold

of
precipitous

porphyry
the
sketch
fig
here
presented
was
taken
by
the
author
in
from
the
old
extinct
volcano
of
roderberg
and
will
convey
perhaps
a
better
idea
of
the
character
of
this
picturesque
range
than
a
description
the
siebengebirge
although
appearing
as
an
isolated
group
of
hills
is
in
reality
an
offshoot
from
the
range
of
the
westerwald
which
is
connected
with
another
volcanic
district
of
central
germany
known
as
the
vogelsgebirge

the

mainly
of
trachytic

namely
and

which
von

makes
two
varieties
that
of
the

and
that
of
the

associated
with
these
varieties

generally
if

the
question
whether
there
is
a
transition
from
the
one
variety
of
volcanic
rock
into
the
other
or
whether
each
belongs
to
a
distinct
and
separate
epoch
of
eruption
does
not
seem
to
be
very
clearly
determined
leonard
horner
states
that
it
would
be
easy
to
form
a
suite
of
specimens
showing
a
gradation
from
a
white
trachyte
to
a
black
basalt
but
we
must
recollect
that
when
horner
wrote
the
microscopic
examination
of
rocks
by
means
of
thin
sections
was
not
known
or
practised
and
an
examination
by
this
process
might
have
proved
that
this
apparent
transition
is
unreal
according
to
von
dechen
there
are
sheets
of
basalt
older
than
the
greater
mass
of
the
brown
coal
formation
and
others
newer
than
the
trachyte
while
dykes
of
basalt
traversing
the
trachytic
lavas
are
not
uncommon
the
which
seems
to
be
associated
with
the
upper
beds
of
the
brown
coal
strata
is
traversed
by
dykes
of
trachyte
of
later
date
and
though
it
is
difficult
to
trace
the
line
between
the
two
varieties
of
this
rock
on
the
ground
von
rath
has
recognised
the
general
distinction
between
them
which
consists
in
the
greater
abundance
of
hornblende
and
mica
in
the
trachyte
of
the
wolkenburg
than
in
that
of
the
drachenfels
the
trachyte
of
the
drachenfels
was
probably
the
neck
of
a
volcano
which
burst
through
the
fundamental
schists
of
the
devonian
period
it
is
remarkable
for
the
large
crystals
of
sanidine
glassy
felspar
which
it
contains
and
has
a
rude
columnar
structure
the
absence
of
any
craters
of
eruption
such
as
are
to
be
found
in
the
eifel
district
and
on
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
as
for
example
in
the
case
of
the
roderberg
may
be
regarded
as
sufficient
evidence
that
this
range
is
of
comparatively
high
antiquity
it
seems
to
bear
the
same
relation
to
the
more
modern
craters
of
the
eifel
and
moselle
that
the
mont
dore
and
cantal
volcanoes
do
to
those

in
both
cases
denudation
carried
on
throughout
perhaps
the
pliocene
and
periods
down
to
the
present
day
has
had
the
effect
of
demolishing
the
original
craters
so
that
what
we
now
observe
as
forming
these
ranges
are
the
consolidated
columns
of
original
molten
matter
which
filled
the
throats
of
the
old
volcanoes
or
the
sheets
of
lava
which
were
extruded
from
them

are
now
probably
much
reduced
in
size
and
extent
having
thus
given
a
description
of
the
older
volcanic

of

shall
cross

of
some

these

and
blown

and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
ashes
and
volcanic
gravel
is
the
result
of
very
recent
eruptions
at
the
east
side
of
the
lake
we
find
a
stream
of
scoriaceous
lava
of
a
purple
or
reddish
colour
highly
vesicular
and
containing
crystals
of
mica
but
the
most
important
is
that
which
has
taken
a
southerly
direction
from
the
crater
of
the
laacher
see
towards
nieder

and
mayen
for
a
distance
of
about
six

this
great

is
covered
throughout
half
its

by
beds
of
volcanic

but
emerges
into
the
air
at
a
distance
of
about
two
miles
from
the
edge
of
the
crater
see
fig
and
was
formerly
extensively
quarried
in
underground
caverns
for
millstones
here
the
rock
is
a
vesicular
trachyte
of
a
greyish
colour
solidified
in
vertical
columns
of
hexagonal
form
about
four
feet
in
diameter
and
traversed
by
transverse
joint
planes
these
quarries
have
been
worked
from
the
time
of
the
roman
occupation
of
the
country
and
before
the
introduction
of
iron
or
steel
rollers
for
grinding
corn
millstones
were
exported
to
all
parts
of

and
the
british

from
this
quarry
the
district
around
the
laacher
see
is
covered
by
laminated
of
the
old
volcano
probably
of
subaërial
origin
through
which
bosses
of
the
fundamental
slate
peer
up
at
intervals
while
the
surface
is
diversified
by
several
truncated
cones
of
the
brühl
the
brühl
valley
which
unites
with
that
of
the
rhine
at
the
town
of
that
name
and
drains
the
northern
side
of
the
volcanic
region
has
always
been
regarded
with
much
interest
by
travellers
for
the
presence
of
a
deposit
of
trass
with
which
it
is
partially
filled
the
origin
of
this
valley
was
as
it
is
hewn
out
of
the
slaty
rocks
of
the
district
but
at
a
later
period
it
became
filled
with
volcanic
mud
tuffstein
out
of
which
the
stream
has
made
for
itself
a
fresh
channel
the
source
of
this
mud
is
considered
by
hibbert
to
have
been
the
old
volcano
of
the
lummerfeld
which
after
becoming
dormant
was
filled
with
water
and
thus
became
a
lake
at
a
subsequent
period
however
a
fresh
eruption
took
place
near
the
edge
of
the
lake
resulting
in
the
remarkable
ruptured
crater
known
as
the
kunksköpfe
which
rises
about
four
miles
to
the
north
of
the
laacher
see
the
eruptions
of
this
volcano
appear
to
have
displaced
the
mud
of
the
lummerfeld
causing
it
to
flow
down
into
the
deep
gorge
of
the
brühl
which
it
completely
filled
as
stated
above
on
walking
down
the
valley
one
may
sometimes
see
the
junction
of
the
tuff
with
the
which
enfolds
it
the
tuff
consists
of
white
felspathic
mud
with
fragments
of
slate
and
lava
reaching
a
depth
in
some
places
of
feet
after
it
has
been
quarried
it
is
ground
in
mills
and
used
for
cement
stone
under
the
name
of
it
is
said
to
resemble
the
volcanic
mud
by
which
herculaneum
was
overwhelmed
during
the
first
eruption
of
vesuvius
and
which
was
produced
by
the
torrents
of
rain
mixing
with
the
ashes
as
they
were
blown
out
of
the
volcano
sufficient

the

a

the

the

and
as
they
are
connected
with

by

at

throughout
the

it
is
tolerably
certain
that
the
volcanoes
lying
at

end
of

chain
belong
to
one
system
and
were
contemporaneously
in
a
state
of
activity
before
entering
any
further
into
particulars
regarding
the
volcanic
phenomena
of
this
region
it
may
be
desirable
to
give
a
short
account
of
its
geological
structure
and
the
physical
conditions
amongst
which
the
igneous
eruptions
were
developed
down
to
the
close
of
the
eocene
period
the
whole
region
now
under
consideration
was
occupied
by
the
waters
of
the
ocean
the
mountains
of
sinai
were
islands
in
this
ocean
which
had
a
very
wide
range
over
parts
of
asia
africa
and
europe
but
at
the
commencement
of
the
succeeding
miocene
stage
the
crust
was
subjected
to
lateral
contraction
owing
to
which
the
ocean
bed
was
upraised
the
strata
were
flexured
folded
and
often
faulted
and
fissured
along
lines
ranging
north
and
south
the
great
fault
of
the
valley
being
the
most
important
at
this
period
the
mountains
of
the
lebanon
the
of
judæa
and
of
arabia
formed
of
limestone
previously
constituting
the
bed
of
the
ocean
during
the
eocene
and
cretaceous
periods
were
converted
into
land
surfaces
along
with
this
upheaval
of
the
there
was
extensive
denudation
and
erosion
of
the
strata
so
that
valleys
were
eroded
over
the
subaërial
tracts
and
the
valley
received
its
primary
form
and
outline
up
to
this
time
there
does
not
appear
to
have
been
any
outbreak
of
volcanic
forces
but
with
the
succeeding
pliocene
period
these
came
into
play
and
eruptions
of
basaltic
lava
took
place
along
rents
and
fissures
in
the
strata
while
craters
and
cones
of
slag
scoriæ
and
ashes
were
thrown
up
over
the
region
lying
to
the
east
of
the
sea
of
galilee
and
the
sources
of
the
jordan
on
the
one
hand
and
the
central
parts
of
the
great
arabian
desert
on
the
other
these
eruptions
probably
intermittent
continued
into
the
succeeding
glacial
or
pluvial
period
and
only
died
out
about
the
time
that
the
earliest
inhabitants
appeared
on
the
scene
jaulân
and
this
tract
is
bounded
by
the
valley
of
the
jordan
and
the
sea
of
galilee
on
the
west
from
which
it
rises
by
steep
and
rocky
declivities

along
deep
channels
in
which
the
basaltic
sheets
and
underlying
limestone
strata
are
well
laid
open
to
view
on
consideration
it
seems
improbable
that
the
great
sheets
of
augitic
lava
such
as
cover
the
surface
of
the
land
of
bashan
are
altogether
the
product
of
the
volcanic
mountains
which
appear
to
be
confined
to
special
districts
in
this
wide
area
some
of
the
craters
do
indeed
send
forth
visible
but
they
are
insignificant
as
compared
with
the
general
mass
of
the
and
the
themselves
appear
in
some
cases
to
be
posterior
to
the
platforms
of
basalt
from
which
they
rise
it
is
very
probable
therefore
that
the
lavas
of
this
region
have
in
the
main
been
extruded
from
fissures
of
eruption
at
an
early
period

a

the
volcanoes
in

little
known

it
has
been
stated
above
that
the
great

probably
been
poured

statement
receives
confirmation
from
the
observations
of
canon
tristram
made
in
the
valley
of
the
yarmûk
this
impetuous
torrent
rushes
down
a
gorge
sometimes
having
limestone
on
one
side
and
a
wall
of
basalt
on
the
other
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
river
channel
had
been
eroded
before
the
volcanic
eruptions
had
commenced
but
on
the
reaching
the
channel
it
naturally
descended
towards
the
valley
of
the
jordan
along
its
bed
displacing
the
river
or
converting
it
into
clouds
of
steam
subsequently
the
river
again
hewed
out
its
channel
sometimes
in
the
lava
sometimes
between
this
rock
and
the
chalky
limestone
but
in
addition
to

after

were
probably
connected
with

north
of

owing
to
this
the

that

together
with
nine

ten
others
along

is
a
circumstance
which
can
not
be
dissociated
from
the
occurrence
of
basaltic
lava
at
this
spot
in
a
reach
of
three
miles
according
to
tristram
there
are
ten
principal
springs
of
which
the
fifth
in

is
the
largest
but
the
seventh

eighth
about

the
tenth
and
last
is
the
hottest

thus
it
would
appear
that
the

increases
with
the

from
the
upper

of
the
a
result
which
might
be
expected
supposing
the
heated
volcanic

to
be
themselves
the
source
of
the
high

to
a
similar
cause
may
be
attributed

it
is
very
clear
that
the
first
eruptions
producing
the
great
basaltic
sheets
of

occurred
after
the
principal
features
of

had
been
developed
the

the

of

and
the
channels
of
the
principal

such
as
those
of

all

had
been

now
as
these
physical

were
developed
and
sculptured
out
during

as
i
have
elsewhere
shown
to
be
the
case
we
may
with
great
probability
refer
the
volcanic
eruptions
to
the
geological
epoch
following
namely
the
pliocene
how
far
downwards
towards
the
historic
period
the
eruptions
continued
is
not
so
certain
daubeny
quoting
several
passages
from
the
old
testament
prophets
says
it
might
be
inferred
that
volcanoes
were
in
activity
even
so
late
as
to
admit
of
their
being
included
within
the
limits
of
authentic
history
the
poetic
language
and
imagery
used
in
these
passages
by
the
prophets
certainly
lends
a
probability
to
this
view
but
nothing
more
on
the
other
hand
these
regions
have
suffered
through
many
centuries
from
the
secondary
effects
of
seismic
action
and
subterranean
forces
and
earthquake
shocks
have
laid
in
ruins
the
great
temples
and
palaces
of
palmyra
baalbec
and
other
cities
of
antiquity
the
same
uncertainty
regarding
the
time
at
which
volcanic
action
died
out
with
reference
to
the
appearance
of
man
on
the
scene
hangs
over
the

as
we
have
seen
to
be
the
case
in
reference
to
the
extinct
volcanoes
of
auvergne
the
eifel
and
the
lower
rhine
in
all
these
cases
the
commencement
and
close
of
eruptive
action
appear
to
have
been
very
much
about
the

period
namely
the
miocene
period
on
the
one
hand
and
that
at

ourselves
in

it
can
not
be
questioned

that
the
volcanic
nature

is
due

the

causes
which
have

be
considered
as
the
connecting
link
in
the
volcanic
chain
between
the
continent
and
the
aleutian
islands
returning
to
utah
we
are
brought
into
contact
with
phenomena
of
special
interest
owing
to
the
of
volcanic
and
lacustrine
conditions
which
once
prevailed
over
large
tracts
of
that
territory
the
present
great
salt
lake
and
the
smaller
neighbouring
lakes
those
called
utah
and
sevier
are
but
remnants
of
an
originally
far
greater
expanse
of
inland
water
the
boundaries
of
which
have
been
traced
out
by
gilbert
and
described
under
the
name
of
lake
bonneville
the
waters
of
this
lake
appear
to
have
reached
their
highest
level
at
the
period
of
maximum
cold
of
the
period
when
the
glaciers
descended
to
its
margin
and
large
streams
of
glacier
water
were
poured
into
it
eruptions
of
basaltic
lava
from
successive
craters
appear
to
have
gone
on
before
during
and
after
the
lacustrine
epochs
and
the
drying
up
of
the
waters
over
the
greater
extent
of
their
original
area
now
converted
into
the
sevier
desert
and
their
concentration
into
their
present
comparatively
narrow
basins
appears
to
have
proceeded
with
the
gradual
extinction
of
the
volcanic
outbursts
two
successive
epochs
of
eruption
of
basalt
appear
to
have
been
clearly
established
an
earlier
one
of
the
provo
age
when
the
lava
was
extruded
from
the
tabernacle
craters
and
a
later
epoch
when
the
eruptions
took
place
from
the
ice
spring
craters
the
oldest
volcanic
rock
appears
to
be
rhyolite
which
peers
up
in
two
small
hills
almost
smothered
beneath
the
lake
deposits
its
eruption
was
long
anterior
to
the
lake
period
on
the
other
hand
the
cessation
of
the
eruptions
of
the
later
basaltic
sheets
is
evidently
an
event
of
such
recent
date
that
gilbert
is
led
to
look
forward
to
their
resumption
at
some
future
but
not
distant
epoch
as
he
truly
observes
we
are
not
to
infer
that
because
the
outward
manifestations
of
volcanic
action
have
ceased
the
internal
causes
of
those
manifestations
have
passed
away
these
are
still
in
operation
and
must
make
themselves
felt
when
the
internal
forces
have
recovered
their
exhausted
energies
but
perhaps
not
to
the
same
extent
as
before
of
the
snake
the
tract
of
country
bordering
the
snake
river
in
idaho
and
washington
is
remarkable
for
the
vast
sheets
of
with
which
it
is
overspread
extending
sometimes
in
one
great
flood
farther
than
the
eye
can
reach
and
what
is
still
more
remarkable
they
are
often
unaccompanied

captain
dutton
in
describing
the
high
plateau
of
utah
observes
that
the
lavas
appear
to
have
welled
up
in
mighty
floods
without
any
of
that
explosive
violence
generally
characteristic
of
volcanic
action
this
extravasated
matter
has
spread
over
wide
fields
deluging
the
surrounding
country
like
a
tide
in
a
bay
and
overflowing
all
inequalities
here
also
we
have
evidence
of
older
volcanic
cones
buried
beneath
seas
of
lava
subsequently
extruded
of
the
absence
or
rarity
of
volcanic
craters
or
cones
of
eruption
in
the
neighbourhood
of
these
great
sheets
has
led
american
geologists
to
the
conclusion
that
the
lavas
were
in
many
cases
extruded
from
fissures
in
the
earth
crust
rather
than
from
ordinary
craters
this
view
is
also
urged
by
sir
geikie
who
visited
the
utah
region
of
the
snake
river
in
and
has
vividly
described
the
impression
produced
by
the
sight
of
these
vast
fields
of
basaltic
lava
he
says
we
found
that
the
older
trachytic
lavas
of
the
hills
had
been
deeply
trenched
by
the
lateral
valleys
and
that
all
these
valleys
had
a
floor
of
black
basalt
that
had
been
poured
out
as
the
last
of
the
molten
materials
from
the
now
extinct
volcanoes
there
were
no
visible
cones
or
vents
from
which
these
floods
of
basalt
could
have
proceeded
we
rode
for
hours
by
the
margin
of
a
vast
plain
of
basalt
stretching
southward
and
westward
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
i
realised
the
truth
of
an
assertion
made
first
by
richthofen
that
our
modern
volcanoes
such
as
vesuvius
and
etna
present
us
with
by
no
means
the
grandest
type
of
volcanic
action
but
rather
belong
to
a
time
of
failing
activity
there
have
been
periods
of
tremendous
volcanic
energy
when
instead
of
escaping
from
a
local
vent
like
a
vesuvian
cone
the
lava
has
found
its
way
to
the
surface
by
innumerable
fissures
opened
for
it
in
the
solid
crust
of
the
globe
over
thousands
of
square
miles
history
of
western
the
general
succession
of
volcanic
events
throughout
the
region
of
western
america
appears
to
have
been
somewhat
as
follows
the
earliest
volcanic
eruptions
occurred
in
the
later
eocene
epoch
and
were
continued
into
the
succeeding
miocene
stage
these
consisted
of
rocks
moderately
rich
in
silica
and
are
grouped
under
the
heads
of
propylite
and
andesite
to
these
succeeded
during
the
pliocene
epoch
still
more
highly
silicated
rocks
of
trachytic
type
consisting
of
sanidine
and
oligoclase
trachytes
then
came
eruptions
of
rhyolite
during
the
later
pliocene
and
pleistocene
epochs
and
lastly
after
a
period
of
cessation
during
which
the
rocks
just
described
were
greatly
eroded
came
the
great
eruptions
of
basaltic
lava
deluging
the
plains
winding
round
the
cones
or
plateaux
of
the
older
lavas
descending
into
the
river
valleys
and
flooding
the
lake
beds
issuing
forth
from
both
vents
and
fissures
and
continuing
intermittently
down
almost
into
the
present
day
certainly
into
the
period
of
man
appearance
on
the
scene
thus
the
volcanic
history
of
western
america
corresponds
remarkably
to
that
of
the
european
regions
with
which
we
have
previously
dealt
both

the
succession
of
the
various
lavas
and

the

of
the

like
those
in
iceland
and
new

are
special
manifestations
of
volcanic
action
generally
in
its
secondary
or
moribund
stage
the
geysers
of
the
yellowstone
occur
on
a
grand
scale
the
eruptions
are
frequent
and
the

is
projected
into
the

to

of

before

the

new
zealand
is
an
island
wherein
seem
to
be
concentrated
all
the
phenomena
of
volcanic
action
of
past
and
present
time
though
it
is
doubtful
if
the
term
active
in
its
full
sense
can
be
applied
to
any
of
the
existing
craters
with
two
or
three
exceptions
such
as
tongariro
and
whakari
island
we
find
craters
and
cones
in
great
numbers
in
perfectly
fresh
condition
extensive
sheets
of
trachytic
and
basaltic
lavas
ashes
and
agglomerates
descending
from
the
ruptured
craters
of

and

geysers
hot

and

which
may
be
counted
by

and
cataracts
breaking
over

of
siliceous

and
lastly
lofty
volcanic
mountains
vying
in
magnitude
with
vesuvius
and
etna
all
these
wonderful
exhibitions
of
moribund
volcanic
action
seem
to
be
concentrated
in
the
northern
island
of
auckland
the
southern
island
which
is
the
larger
also
has
its
natural
attractions
but
they
are
of
a
different
kind
chief
of
all
is
the
grand
range
of
mountains
called
not
inappropriately
the
southern
alps
vying
with
its
european
representative
in
the
loftiness
of
its
peaks
and
the
splendour
of
its
snowfields
and
glaciers
but
formed
of
more
ancient
and
solid
rocks
than
those
of
the
northern
island
we
are
indebted
to
several
naturalists
for
our
knowledge
of
the
volcanic
regions
of
new
zealand
but
chiefly
to
ferdinand
von
hochstetter
whose
beautiful
maps
and
graphic
descriptions
leave
nothing
to
be
desired
in
this
work
hochstetter
was
assisted
by
julius
haast
and
sir
hector
from
their
account
we
learn
that
the
isthmus
of
auckland
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
volcanic
districts
in
the
world
it
is
characterised
by
a
large
number
of
extinct
in
a
greater
or
less
perfect
state
of
preservation
and
giving
origin
to
which
have
poured
down
the
sides
of
the
hills
on
to
the
plains
besides
these
are
others
formed
of
stratified
tuff
with
interior
craters
surrounding
in
mural
cliffs
eruptive
cones
of
scoriæ
ashes
and
lapilli
these
cones
are
scattered
over
the
isthmus
and
shores
of
waitemata
and
manukau
the
tuff
cones
and
craters
rise
from
a
floor
of
tertiary
sandstone
and
shale
the
horizontal
strata
of
which
are
laid
open
in
the
precipitous
bluffs
of
waitemata
and
manukau
harbours
they
sometimes
contain
fossil
shells
of
the
genera
and
as
the
volcanic
are
intermingled
with
the
upper
tertiary
strata
it
is
inferred
that
the
first
outbursts
of
volcanic
forces
occurred
when
the
region
was
still
beneath
the
waters
of
the
ocean
show
that
the
different
layers
slope
both
outwards
parallel
to
the
sides
and
inwards
towards
the
bottom
of
the
craters
sometimes
these
craters
have
been
converted
into
lakes
as
in
the
case
of
those
of
the
eifel
but
generally
they
are
dry
or
have
a
floor
of
morass
of
the
those
of
kohuora
five
in
number
are
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
and
in
the
case
of
two
of
these
the
central
cones
of
slag
appear
as
islets
rising

we
must

is
a
compound
volcano
in
which
the
oldest
and
smallest
of
the

is

very
beautifully
the
outward
slope
of
its
beds
within
this
crater
arise
two
cones
of
cinders
each
with
small
craters
it
would
appear
that
after
a
long
interval
the
larger
of
the
two
principal
cones
formed
of
cinders
and
known
as
mount
wellington
burst
forth
from
the
southern
margin
of
the
older
and
being
built
up
to
a
height
of
feet
gradually
overspread
the
sides
of
its
older
neighbour
mount
wellington
itself
has
three
craters
and
from
these
large
streams
of
basaltic
lava
have
issued
forth
in
a
westerly
direction
while
a
branch
entered
and
partially
filled
the
old
to
the
northwards
southwards
from
manukau
harbour
and
extending
a
short
distance
from
the
to
taranaki
point
there
occurs
a
plateau
of
with
sheets
of
basaltic
lava
overspreading
the
tertiary
strata
these
are
intersected
by
eruptive
masses
in
the
form
of
dykes
but
still
there
are
no
craters
or
cones
of
eruption
to
be
seen
so
that
we
may
infer
that
the
sheets
at
least
were
extruded
from
fissures
in
the
manner
of
those
of
the
colorado
or
idaho
regions
of
america
proceeding
still
further
south
into
the
interior
of
the
island
we
here
find
a
lofty
plateau
of
an
average
elevation
of
feet
interposed
between
the
tertiary
beds
of
the
upper
and
middle
waikato
and
formed
of
trachytic
and
tuff
amongst
which
arise
old
extinct
volcanic
cones
such
as
those
of
karioi
pirongia
kakepuku
maunga
tautari
aroha
and
many
others
these
trachytic
lavas
would
seem
to
be
more
ancient
than
the
basaltic
previously
described
lake
and
surrounding
but
of
all
these
volcanic
districts
none
is
more
remarkable
than
that
surrounding
the
taupo
lake
which
lies
amidst
the
tertiary
strata
of
the
upper
waikato
basin
the
surface
of
this
lake
is
feet
above
that
of
the
ocean
and
its
margin
is
enclosed
within
a
border
of
rhyolite
and
pitchstone
rising
into
a
mass
of
the
same
material
feet
high
on
the
eastern
side
the
form
of
the
lake
does
not
suggest
that
it
is
itself
the
crater
of
a
volcano
but
rather
that
it
was
originated
by
subsidence
on
all
sides
however
trachytic
cones
arise
of
which
the
most
remarkable
group
lies
to
the
south
of
the
lake
just
in
front
of
the
two
giant
trachytic
cones
the
loftiest
in
new
zealand
one
called
tongariro
rising
about
feet
and
the
other
ruapahu
which
attains
an
elevation
of
over
feet
with
the
summit
capped
by
snow
these
two
lofty
cones
standing
side
by
side
are
supposed
by
the
maoris
to
be
the
husband
and
wife
to
whom
were
born
the
group
of
smaller
cones
above
referred
to
as
occupying
the
southern
shore
of
taupo
lake
the
volcano
of
tongariro
may
still
be
considered
as
in
a
state
of
activity
as
its
two
craters
ngauruhoe
and
ketetahi
constantly
emit
steam
and
several
solfataras
break
out
on
its
flanks
in
a
northerly
direction
from
tongariro
and

and
the

by
which
it
is

amongst
such
eruptions

we
might
expect
the
formation
of
siliceous

and
the
deposition
of
sulphur
and
other
minerals
nor
will
our
expectations
be
disappointed
for
here
we
have
the
wonderful

deposited
by
the
waters
entering
roto
mahana
as
they
descend
from
the
numerous

all
travellers
concur
in
describing
these
terraces
as
the
most
wonderful
of
all
the
wonders
of
the
lake

of
new

so
great
is
their

and
so
rich
and
varied
is
their

the
beautiful

no
fewer
than
ten
large
sinter
terraces
descending
towards

besides
several
fumaroles
and
solfataras
but
the
largest
and
most
celebrated
of
all
the
sinter
terraces
has
within
the
last
few
years
been
buried
from
view
beneath
a
flood
of
volcanic
trass
or

an
event
which
was
as
unexpected
as
it
was
unwelcome
in

volcanic
forces
may
have
become
in
this
latter
instance
quiescent
for
a
somewhat
longer
period
in
all
the
cases
we
have
been
considering
whether
those
of
central
italy
of
the
rhine
and
moselle
of
auvergne
or
of
syria
and
arabia
the
cones
and
craters
of
eruption
are
generally
present
entire
or
but
slightly
modified
in
form
and
size
by
the
effects
of
time
but
in
the
case
of
the
tertiary
volcanic
districts
of
the
british
isles
this
is
not
so
on
the
contrary
these
more
prominent
features
of
vulcanicity
over
the
surface
of
the
ground
have
been
removed
by
the
agents
of
denudation
and
our
observations
are
confined
to
the
phenomena
presented
by
extensive
sheets
of
lava
and
beds
of
ash
or
the
stumps
and
necks
of
former
vents
of
eruption

with
dykes
of

which
the

volcanic
region
of

of
mull
and
adjoining
districts
on
the
mainland
of
morvern
and
ardnamurchan
into
the
isle
of
skye
and
comprises
several
smaller
islets
the
whole
being
included
in
the
general
name
of
the
inner
hebrides
it
is
doubtful
if
the
volcanic
lavas
of
antrim
were
ever
physically
connected
with
those
of
the
west
of
scotland
though
they
may
be
considered
as
contemporary
with
them
and
in
all
cases
the
existing
tracts
of
volcanic
rock
are
mere
fragments
of
those
originally
formed
by
the
extrusion
of
lavas
from
vents
of
eruption
in
addition
to
these
there
are
large
areas
of
volcanic
rock
overspread
by
the
waters
of
the
ocean
the
british
volcanic
eruptions
now
under
consideration
are
all
later
than
the
cretaceous
period
throughout
antrim
and
in
parts
of
mull
the
lavas
are
found
resting
on
highly
eroded
faces
either
of
the
upper
chalk
fig
or
where
it
has
been
altogether
denuded
away
on
still
older
mesozoic
strata
from
the
relations
of
the
basaltic
sheets
of
antrim
to
the
upper
chalk
it
is
clear
that
the
latter
formation
after
its
deposition
beneath
the
waters
of
the
cretaceous
seas
was
elevated
into
dry
land
and
exposed
to
a
long
period
of
subaërial
erosion
before
the
first
sheets
of
lava
invaded
the
surface
of
the
ground
we
are
therefore
tolerably
safe
in
considering
the
first
eruptions
to
belong
to
the
tertiary
period
but
the
evidence
derived
as
it
is
exclusively
from
plant
remains
is
somewhat
conflicting
as
to
the
precise
epoch
to
which
the
lavas
and
beds
of
tuff
containing
the
are
to
be
referred
the
probabilities
appear
to
be
that
they
are
of
miocene
age
and
if
so
the
trachytic
lavas
which
in
antrim
are
older
than
those
containing
plants
may
be
referred
to
a
still
earlier
epoch
namely
that
of
the
eocene
as
plant
remains
are
not
very
distinctive
the
question
regarding
the
exact
time
of
the
first
volcanic
eruptions
will
probably
remain
for
ever
undecided
but
we
are
not
likely
to
be
much
in
error
if
we
consider
the
entire
volcanic
period
to
range
from
the
close
of
the
eocene
to
that
of
the
miocene
by
far
the
greater
mass
of
the
volcanic
rocks
being
referable
to
the
latter
epoch
in
describing
the
british
volcanic
districts
it
will
be
most
convenient
to
deal
with
them
in
three
divisions

and
a
third
at
carmoney
hill
above
belfast
lough
but
by
far
the
most
prominent
of
these
old
solidified
vents
of
eruption
is
that
of
sleamish
a
conspicuous
mountain
which
rises
above
the
general
level
of
the
plateau
near
ballymena
and
attains
an
elevation
of
feet
above
the
sea
seen
from
the
west
the
mountain
has
the
appearance
of
a
cone
but
on
examination
it
is
found
to
be
in
reality
a
huge
dyke
breaking
off
abruptly
towards
the
in
which
direction
it
reaches
its
greatest
height
then
sloping
downwards
towards
the
east
this
form
suggests
that
sleamish
is
in
reality
one
of
the
of
eruption
rather
than
the
neck
of
an
old
volcano
the
rock
of
which
it
is
formed
consists
of
exceedingly
massive
dolerite
rich
in
olivine
and
divided
into
large
quadrangular
blocks
by
parallel
joint
planes
its
junction
with
the
from
which
it
rises
can
nowhere
be
seen
but
at
the
nearest
point
where
the
two
rocks
are
traceable
the
appears
to
be
somewhat
indurated
breaking
with
a
splintery
fracture
and
a
sharp
ring
under
the
hammer
suggesting
that
the
lava
of
sleamish
had
been
extruded
through
the
horizontal
sheets
and
had
considerably
indurated
the
portions
in
contact
with
or
in
proximity
to
it
amongst
the
vents
filled
with
ash
and
agglomerate
the
most
remarkable
is
that
of
near
ballycastle
it
forms
this
rocky
island
and
a
portion
of
the
adjoining
coast
where
the
beds
of
ash
are
finely
displayed
consisting
of
fragments
and
bombs
of
basalt
with
pieces
of
chalk
flint
and
peperino
which
is
irregularly
bedded
these
attain
a
thickness
of
about
feet
just
below
the
road
to
ballycastle
but
rapidly
tail
out
in
both
directions
from
the
locality
of
the
vent
just
below
the
the
white
chalk
with
flints
may
be
seen
extending
down
into
the
nowhere
in
antrim
is
there
such
a
display
of
volcanic
ash
and
agglomerate
as
at
this
spot
conditions
under
which
they
were
no
one
can
visit
the
geological
sections
in
antrim
and
the
adjoining
districts
of
down
armagh
derry
and
tyrone
without
being
struck
by
the
great
number
and
variety
of
the
igneous
dykes
by
which
the
rocks
are
traversed
the
great
majority
of
these
dykes
are
basaltic
and
they
are
found
traversing
all
the
formations
including
the
cretaceous
and
tertiary
basaltic
sheets
the
carlingford
and
mourne
mountains
are
seamed
with
such
dykes
and
they
are
splendidly
laid
open
to
view
along
the
coast
south
of
newcastle
in
down
as
also
along
the
antrim
coast
from
belfast
to
larne
the
fine
old
castle
of
carrickfergus
has
its
foundations
on
one
of
those
intrusions
but
one
of
greater
size
than
ordinary
all
the
dykes
here
referred
to
are
not
however
of
the
same
age
as
is
conclusively
proved
by
sections
amongst
the
mourne
mountains
where
cliffs
of
lower
silurian
strata
superimposed
on
the
intrusive
granite
of
the
district
exhibit
two
sets
of
basaltic
dykes
one
the
older
abruptly
terminated
at
the
granite
margin
the
other
and
newer
penetrating
the
granite
and
silurian
rocks
alike
it
is
not
improbable
that
the
older
dykes
belong
to
the
carboniferous
or
permian
age
while
the
newer
are
with
equal
probability
of
tertiary
age
sir
geikie
has
shown
that
the
tertiary
dykes
of
the
north
of
ireland
are
representatives
of
others
occurring
at
intervals
over
the
north
of
england
and
central
and
western
scotland
all
pointing
towards
the
central
region
of
volcanic
activity
or
in
a
parallel
direction
thereto
approximating
to
the
in
ireland
the
island
of
islay
and
east
argyleshire
but
in
the
centre
of
scotland
generally
ranging
from
east
to
west
the
area
affected
by
the
dykes
of
undoubted
tertiary
age
geikie
estimates
at
no
less
than
square
miles
a
territory
greater
than
either
scotland
or
ireland
and
equal
to
more
than
a
third
of
the
total
of
the
british
isles
and
he
regards
them
as
posterior
to
the
rest
of
the
geological
structures
of
the
regions
which
they
traverse
it
is
clear
that
the
dykes
referred
to
belong
to
one
great
system
of
eruption
or
intrusion
and
they
may
be
regarded
as
the
manifestation
of
the
final
effort
of
internal
forces
over
this
region
of
the
british
isles
they
testify
to
the
existence
of
a
continuous
or
shell
of
augitic
lava
beneath
the
crust
and
as
the
aggregate
horizontal
extent
of
all
these
dykes
or
of
the
fissures
which
they
fill
must
be
very
considerable
it
is
clear
that
the
crust
through
which
they
have
been
extruded
has
received
an
accession
of
horizontal
space
and
has
been
fissured
by
forces
acting
from
beneath
as
the
late
hopkins
of
cambridge
had
explained
on
mechanical
grounds
in
his
elaborate
essay
many
years
ago
this
view
occurred
to
myself
when
examining
the
region
of
the
of
ireland
but
i
was
not
then
aware
that
it
had
been
dealt
with
on
mathematical
principles
by
so
eminent
a
mathematician
the
bulging
of
the
crust
is
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
absence
of
plication
of
the
strata
due
to
the
extrusion
of
this
enormous
quantity
of
molten
lava
and
the
intrusion
of
thousands
of
dykes
over
the
of
ireland
unaccompanied
by
foldings
of
the
strata
must
have
added
a
horizontal
space
of
several
thousand
feet
to
that
region
a
peculiar
form
of
crystalline
quartz
first
recognized
in
this
rock
by
a
distinguished
german
petrologist
the
late
von
lasaulx
who
visited
the
district
in
sir
geikie
has
disputed
the
correctness
of
the
view
which
i
advocated
as
far
back
as
that
the
trachytic
lavas
of
antrim
are
the
earliest
products
of
volcanic
action
but
at
the
time
he
wrote
his
paper
on
the
volcanic
history
of
these
islands
it
was
not
known
that
pebbles
of
this
trachyte
are
largely
distributed
amongst
the
which
occur
in
the
very
midst
of
the
overlying
basaltic
sheets
as
i
shall
have
to
explain
later
on
this
discovery
puts
the
question
at
rest
as
regards
the
relations
of
the
two
sets
of
rocks
this
remarkable
section
at
the
chalk
quarries
of
templepatrick
the
author
has
figured
and
described
in
the
geology
and
geography
of
edit
where
the
reader
will
find
the
subject
discussed
more
fully
than
can
be
done
here
these
pebbles
were
first
noticed
by
mchenry
of
the
irish
geological
survey
in
the
vertical
position
of
the
columns
of
the
giant
causeway
is
rather
enigmatical
the
causeway
can
not
be
a
dyke
as
has
often
been
supposed
otherwise
the
columns
would
have
been
horizontal
at
right
angles
to
the
sides
of
the
dyke
symes
of
the
geological
survey
has
suggested
that
the
causeway
columns
have
been
vertically
lowered
between
two
lines
of
fault
and
that
originally
they
formed
a
portion
of
the
tier
of
beautiful
columns
seen
in
the
cliff
above
and
known
as
the
organ
sleamish
and
several
other
of
the
antrim
vents
are
described
by
sir
geikie
in
the
monograph
already
referred
to
also
in
the
memoirs
of
the
geological
survey
of
a
diagrammatised
section
of
the
volcanic
neck
is
given
by
sir
geikie
geikie
the
view
that
the
crust
of
the
earth
has
been
horizontally

the

by
mcculloch
in

island
of
mull
and
adjoining
coast
the
island
of
mull
with
the
adjoining
districts
of
morvern
and
ardnamurchan
forms
the
more
southern
of
the
two
chief
centres
of
tertiary
volcanic
eruptions
in
the
west
of
scotland
that
of
skye
being
the
more
northern
these
districts
have
been
the
subject
of
critical
and
detailed
study
by
several
geologists
from
mcculloch
down
to
the
present
day
and
amongst
the
more
recent
sir
archibald
geikie
and
professor
judd
hold
the
chief
place
unfortunately
the
interpretation
of
the
volcanic
phenomena
by
these
two
accomplished
observers
has
led
them
to
very
different
conclusions
as
regards
several
important
points
in
the
volcanic
history
of
these
groups
of
islands
as
for
example
regarding
the
relative
ages
of
the
and
the
acid
rocks
such
as
the
trachytes
and
granophyres
again
as
regards
the
presence
of
distinct
centres
of
eruption
and
also
as
regards
the
relations
of
the
gabbros
of
skye
to
the
basaltic
sheets
such
being
the
case
it
would
appear
the
height
of
rashness
on
the
part
of
the
writer
especially
in
the
absence
of
a
detailed
examination
of
the
sections
over
the
whole
region
to
venture
on
a
statement
of
opinion
regarding
the
points
at
issue
and
he
must
therefore
content
himself
with
a
brief
account
of
the
phenomena
as
gathered
from
a
perusal
of
the
writings
of
these
and
other
observers
guided
also
to
some
extent
by
the
analogous
phenomena
presented
by
the
volcanic
region
of
the
of
ireland
as
in
the
case
of
the
antrim
district
the
island
of
mull
and
adjoining
tracts
present
us
with
the
spectacle
of
a
vast
accumulation
of
basaltic
piled
layer
upon
layer
with
intervening
beds
of
bole
and
tuff
up
to
a
thickness
according
to
geikie
of
about
feet
at
the
grand
headland
of
gribon
on
the
west
coast
the
basaltic
sheets
are
seen
to
rise
in
one
sheer
sweep
to
a
height
of
feet
and
then
to
stretch
away
with
a
slight
easterly
dip
under
ben
more
at
a
distance
of
some
eight
miles
this
mountain
the
upper
part
of
which
is
formed
of
beds
of
ashes
reaches
an
elevation
of
feet
so
that
the
accumulated
thickness
of
the
beds
of
basalt
under
the
higher
part
of
the
mountain
must
be
at
least
equal
to
the
amount
stated
above
that
is
twice
as
great
as
the
representative
masses
of
antrim
the
base
of
the
volcanic
series
is
seen
at
carsaig
and
gribon
to
rest
on
cretaceous
and
jurassic
rocks
like
those
of
antrim
hence
the
tertiary
age
is
fully
established
by
the
evidence
of
superposition
this
was
further
confirmed
by
the
discovery
by
the
duke
of
argyll
some
years
ago
of
bands
of
and
tuff
with
dicotyledonous
leaves
amongst
the
basalts
of
ardtun
head
the
basement
beds
of
tuff
and
gravel
contain
besides
pebbles
of
flint
and
chalk
others
of
sanidine
trachyte
showing
that
highly
acid
lavas
had
been
extruded
and
consolidated
before
the
first
eruption
of
the
another
point
of
analogy
between
the
volcanic
phenomenon
of
antrim
and
the
inner
hebrides
these
great
sheets
of
augitic
lava
extend
over
the
whole
of
the
northern
tract
of
mull
the
isles
of
ulva
and
staffa
and
for
a
distance
of
several
miles
inwards
from
the
northern
shore
of
the
sound
of
mull
covering
the
wild
moorlands
of
morvern
and
ardnamurchan
where
they
terminate
in
escarpments
and
outlying
masses
indicating
an
originally
much
more
extended
range
than
at
the
present
day
the
summits
of
ben
more
and
its
neighbouring
height
ben
buy
are
formed
of
beds
of
ash
and
tuff
the
volcanic
plateau
is
according
to
judd
abruptly
terminated
along
the
southern
side
by
a
large
vault
bringing
the
basalt
in
contact
with
palæozoic
rocks
the
greater
part
of
the
tract
lying
to
the
south
of
loch
na
keal
which
almost
divides
mull
into
two
islands
and
extending
southwards
and
eastwards
to
the
shores
of
the
firth
of
lorn
and
the
sound
of
mull
is
formed
of
a
peculiar
group
of
acid
or
highly
silicated
rocks
classed
under
the
general
term
of
granophyres
these
rocks
approach
towards
true
granites
in
one
direction
and
through
and
felsite
to
rhyolite
in
another
probably
depending
upon
the
conditions
of
cooling
and
consolidation
in
their
mode
of
weathering
and
general
appearance
on
a
large
scale
they
present
a
marked
contrast
to
the
basic
lavas
with
which
they
are
in
contact
from
the
coast
of
na
keal
to
that
of
buy
the
nature
of
this
contact
whether
indicating
the
priority
of
the
granophyres
to
the
or
otherwise
is
a
matter
of
dispute
between
the
two
observers
above
named
but
the
circumstantial
account
given
by
sir
geikie
accompanied
by
drawings
of
special
sections
showing
this
contact
appears
to
prove
that
the
granophyre
is
the
newer
of
the
two
masses
of
volcanic
rock
and
that
it
has
been
intruded
amongst
the

a
late
period

the

of
the
geikie
rocks
of

and

assuming
sir
geikie
view
to
be
correct
it
is
possible
that
we
may
have
in
the
granite
and
of
mourne
and
carlingford
representatives
of
the
granites
granophyres
and
other
acid
rocks
of
the
later
period
of

the
granite
of
mourne
is
peculiar
in
structure
and
differs
from
the
ordinary
type
of
that
rock
in
which
the
silica
forms
the
ground
mass
in
the
case
of
the
granite
of
the
mourne
mountains
the
rock
consists
of
a
crystalline
granular
aggregate
of
orthoclase
albite
and
mica
it
is
also
full
of
drusy
cavities
in
which
the
various
minerals
crystallise
out
in
very
perfect
form
as
far
as
regards
direct
evidence
the
age
of
this
rock
can
only
be
stated
to
be
and
earlier
than
certain
tertiary
basaltic
dykes
by
which
it
is
traversed
the
granophyres
of
mull
are
traversed
by
similar
dykes
which
are
representatives
of
the
very
latest
stage
of
volcanic
action
in
the
british
islands
the
author
is
therefore
inclined
to
concur
with
sir
geikie
in
assigning
to
the
granite
of
the
mourne
mountains
and
the
representative
felsitic
rocks
of
the
carlingford
mountains
a
tertiary
age
in
which
case
the
analogy
between
the

of

of

of

isle
of

this
is
the
largest
and
most
important
of
all
the
tertiary
volcanic
districts
but
owing
to
the
extensive
denudation
to
which
in
common
with
other
tertiary
volcanic
regions
of
the
british
isles
it
has
been
subjected
its
present
limits
are
very
restricted
comparatively
to
its
original
extent
not
only
is
this
evident
from
the
manner
in
which
the
basaltic
sheets
terminate
along
the
in
grand
mural
cliffs
as
opposite
macleod
maidens
and
at
the
entrance

on

but
the
evidence
is
according
to
sir
geikie
still
more
striking
along
the
eastern
coast
showing
that
the
jurassic
and
other
older
rocks
there
visible
were
originally
buried
deep
under
the
basaltic
sheets

have
been
stripped

occupy

of

also

equally
circumstantial
is

account
of
the
relations
of
the
granophyres
to
the
gabbros
as
seen
at

and
the
western
border
of
the

hills
where
the
former
rock
may
be
seen
to
send
numerous
veins
into
the
latter
not
only
is
this
so
but
the
granophyre
is
frequently
seen
to
truncate
and
abruptly
terminate
some
of
the
basaltic
dykes
by
which
the
basic
sheets
are
traversed
as
in
the
neighbourhood
of
beinn
na
dubhaic
all
these
phenomena
strongly
remind
us
of
the
conditions
of
similar
rocks
amongst
the
mountains
of
mourne
and
carlingford
in
ireland
where
at
barnaveve
the
syenite
or
hornblendic
is
seen
to
break
through
the
masses
of
olivine
gabbro
and
send
numerous
veins
into
this
latter
rock
the
interpretation
here
briefly
sketched
differs
widely
from
that
arrived
at
by
professor
judd
the
granitoid
masses
of
the
red
mountains
beinn
dearg
and
the
neighbouring
heights
are
in
his
view
the
roots
of
the
great
volcano
from
which
were
erupted
the
various
lavas
the
earlier
eruptions
producing
the
acid
lavas
to
be
followed
by
the
gabbros
and
these
by
the
sheets
which
stretch
away
towards
the
north
and
west
into
several
peninsulas
thus
he
holds
that
the
rocks
of
basic
composition
were
ejected
subsequently
to
those
of
the
acid
variety
and
appeals
to
various
sections
in
confirmation
of
this
view
to
reconcile
these
views
is
at
present
impossible
but
as
the
controversy
between
these
two
observers
is
probably
not
yet
closed
there
is
room
for
hope
that
the
true
interpretation
of
the
relations
of
these
rocks
to
each
other
will
ere
long
be

established

above

what
is
specially
remarkable
is
the
evidence
afforded
by
an
examination
of
the
course
of
the
scuir
that
it
follows
the
channel
of
an
ancient
which
has
been
hollowed
out
in
the
surface
of
the
plateau
the
course
of
this
channel
is
indicated
by
the
presence
of
a
deposit
of
which
in
some
places
forms
a
sort
of
cushion
between
the
base
of
the
scuir
and
the
side
of
the
channel
over

viscous

to
have

also
of
the

small
tributary

the

date
of
the

forming

remarkable
mural
ridge

shown
by
the
fact
that
the

truncated

the

is
therefore
more
recent
and
as
we
have
seen
the

stream
is
more
recent
than
the
but
at
the
time
when
this

the

this

seems
to
have
been
perhaps
the
most

perhaps
on

account
the
most
striking
of
the
numerous
examples
exhibited
throughout
the
west
of
scotland
and

of
the
enormous
amount
of
denudation
to
which
these
districts
have
been
subjected
since
the
extinction
of
the
volcanic
fires
and
this
at
a
period
to
which
we
can
not
assign
a
date
more
ancient
than
that
of
the
pliocene
yet
let
us
consider
for
a
moment
to
what
physical
vicissitudes
these
districts
have
been
subjected
since
that
epoch
assuming
as
we
may
with
confidence
that
the
volcanic
eruptions
were
subaërial
and
that
the
tracts
covered
by
the
were
in
the
condition
of
dry
land
when
the
eruptions
commenced
in
this
condition
they
continued
in
the
main
throughout
the
period
of
volcanic
activity
but
the
eruptions
had
scarcely
ceased
and
the
lava
floods
and
dykes
become
consolidated
before
the
succeeding
glacial
epoch
set
in
when
the
snows
and
glaciers
of
the
scottish
highlands
gradually
descending
from
their
original
mountain
heights
and
spreading
outwards
in
all
directions
ultimately
enveloped
the
whole
of
the
region
we
are
now
considering
until
it
was
entirely
concealed
beneath
a
mantle
of
ice
moving
slowly
but
irresistibly
outwards
towards
the
atlantic
crossing
the
deep
channels
such
as
the
sound
of
mull
and
the
minch
climbing
up
the
sides
of
opposing
rocks
and
islands
until
even
the
outer
hebrides
and
the
of
ireland
were
covered
by
one
vast
mantle
of
ice
and
snow
the
movement
of
such
a
body
of
ice
over
the
land
must
have
been
attended
with
a
large
amount
of
abrasion
of
the
rocky
floor
nor
have
the
evidences
of
that
abrasion
entirely
disappeared

at
the

still
detect
the
grooves

on

have
been

coating

clay

we
still
find

of
that
mighty

whatever
may
have

the

less
horizontal

of

epoch
characterised
by
milder
conditions
of
climate
set
in
this

accompanied
by
subsidence
and
submersion
of
large
tracts
of
the
land
during
the
interglacial
stage
so
that
the
sea
rose
to
heights
of
several
hundred
feet
above
the
present

has
left
behind
stratified
gravels
with
shells
at
these
elevations

during
this

of
subsequent
the

must
have
told
severely
on
the
coast
and
islands
wearing
them
into
cliffs
and
escarpments
furrowing
out
channels
and
levelling
obstructions
such
action
has
gone
on
down
to
the
present
day
the
of
scotland
and
of
ireland
has
been
subjected
throughout
a
very
lengthened
period
to
the
wear
and
tear
of
the

constituting
the
outer
hebrides

composed

done
much
to
retard

otherwise

such
is
the
tremendous
power
of
the

billows

impelled

that
to
their
agency
must
be
mainly
attributed
the

however
it

tolerably
clear
that
the
volcanic

commenced
towards
the
close
of

continued
into
the
commencement
of

are
these

they
may
not
be
considered

area
extending
from
abyssinia
through
southern

the

in
the
one
direction
while
the

cones
of

with
their
surrounding
tracts
of

matter
may
be
the
extreme
prolongations
in
the

along
this

volcanic
operations
are
still
active
in
the

of

and

quite
unchanged
in
form
and
evidently
of
very
recent
date
abound
in
many
places
along
the
coast
both
of
arabia
and
africa
the
volcanic
formations
of
this
tract
are
however
much
more
recent
than
those
which
occupy
the
high
plateaux
of
central
and
southern
abyssinia
of
which
we
are
about
to
speak
abyssinia
forms
a
compact
region
of

intersected
by
deep

between
the

of
the

on
the
west
and
the
tract
bordering
the
red

and
the
indian

on
the

the

are
deeply
intersected
by

giving
birth
to
streams
which
feed
the

of

several

on

which
from
its
form
and
the
volcanic
nature
of
the
surrounding
hills
appears
to
occupy
the
hollow
of
an
extinct
crater
the
of
abyssinia
reaches
its
highest
elevation
along
the
eastern
and
southern
margin
where
its
average
height
may
be
to
feet
but
some
peaks
rise
to
a
height
of
to
feet
in
shoa
and
ankobar
lava
an
enormous
area
of
this
country
seems
to
be
composed
of
volcanic
rocks
chiefly
in
the
form
of
sheets
of
basaltic
lava
which
rise
into
high
plateaux
and
break
off
in
steep
sometimes
precipitous
mural
escarpments
along
the
sides
of
the
valleys
these
are
divisible
into
the
following
series
ashangi
volcanic
the
earliest
forerunners
of
the
more
recent
lavas
seem
to
have
been
erupted
in
jurassic
times
in
the
form
of
sheets
of
contemporaneous
basalt
or
dolerite
amongst
the
antola
limestones
which
are
of
this
period
but
the
great
mass
of
the
volcanic
rocks
are
much
more
recent
and
may
be
confidently
referred
to
the
late
cretaceous
or
early
tertiary
epochs
their
resemblance
to
the
great
trappean
series
of
western
india
even
in
minute
particulars
is
referred
to
by
blanford
who
suggests
the
view
that
they
belong
to
one
and
the
same
great
series
of
extruded
over
the
surface
of
this
part
of
the
globe
this
view
is
inherently
probable
they
consist
of
basalts
and
dolerites
generally
amygdaloidal
with
nodules
of
agate
and
zeolite
and
are
frequently
coated
with
chlorite
beds
of
volcanic
ash
or
breccia
also
frequently
occur
and
often
contain
augite
crystals
at
senafé
hills
of
trachyte
passing
into
claystone
and
basalt
were
observed
by
blanford
but
it
is
not
clear
what
are
their
relations
to
the
sheets
volcanic
this
is
a
more
recent
group
of
volcanic
lavas
chiefly
distinguished
from
the
lower
or
ashangi
group
by
the
occurrence
of
thick
beds
of
trachyte
usually
more
or
less
crystalline
and
containing
beautiful
crystals
of
sanidine
the
beds
of
trachyte
break
off
in
precipitous
scarps
and
being
of
great
thickness
and
perfectly
horizontal
are
unusually
conspicuous
blanford
says
with
regard
to
this
group
that
there
is
a
remarkable
resemblance
in
its
physical
aspect
to
the
scenery
of
the
deccan
and
the
higher
valleys
of
the
western
ghats
of
india
but
the
peculiarities
of
the
landscape
are
exaggerated
in
abyssinia
many
of
the
trachytic
beds
are
brecciated
and
highly
columnar
sedimentary
beds
are
also
interstratified
with
those
of
volcanic
origin
the
magdala
group
is
unconformable
to
that
of
ashangi
in
some
places
a
still
more
recent
group
of
volcanic
rocks
appears
to
occur
in
the
neighbourhood
of
senafé
consisting
of
amorphous
masses
of
trachyte
often
so
and
compact
as
to
pass
into
claystone
and
to
resemble
sandstone
at
akub
teriki
the
rocks
appear
to
be
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
an
ancient
vent
of
eruption
from
what
has
been
said
it
will
be
apparent
that
abyssinia
offers
volcanic
phenomena
of
great
interest
for
the
observer
there
is
considerable
variety
in
the
rock
masses
in
their
mode
of
distribution
and
in
the
scenery
which
they
produce
the
extensive
horizontal
sheets
of
lava
are
suggestive
of
rather
than
of
eruption
through
volcanic
craters
and
although
these
may
have
once
been
in
existence
denudation
has
left
no
vestiges
of
them
at
the
present
day
in
all
these
respects
the
resemblance
of
the
volcanic
phenomena
to
those
of
peninsular
india
is
remarkably
striking
it
suggests
the
view
that
they
are
contemporaneous
as
regards
the
time
of
their
eruption
and
similar
as
regards
their
mode
of

it
is
beyond

of

to
describe
the
volcanic

of

over

the

is

too
large
to

treated
otherwise
than
in

separate

i
will
therefore
content
myself
with
a
brief
enumeration
of
the
formations
of
the
british
isles
in
which
contemporaneous
volcanic
action
has
been
recognised
there
is
little
evidence
of
volcanic
action
throughout
the
long
lapse
of
time
extending
backwards
from
the
cretaceous
to
the
triassic
epochs
that
is
to
say
throughout
the
mesozoic
or
secondary
period
and
it
is
not
till
we
reach
the
palæozoic
strata
that
evidence
of
volcanic
action
unmistakably
presents
itself
in
ayrshire
and
in
the
western
parts
of
devonshire
beds
of
felspathic
porphyry
felstone
and
ash
are
interstratified
with
strata
believed
to
be
of
permian
age
in
devonshire
these
have
only
recently
been
recognised
by
irving
and
the
author
as
of
permian
age
the
strata
consisting
of
beds
of
breccia
lying
at
the
base
of
the
new
red
sandstone
those
of
ayrshire
have
long
been
recognised
as
of
the
same
period
as
they
rest
unconformably
on
the
coal
measures
and
consist
of
porphyrites
melaphyres
and
tuffs
of
volcanic
origin
volcanic
rocks
occur
amongst
the
of
england
and
scotland
while
they
are
also
found
interbedded
with
the
carboniferous
limestone
series
in
derbyshire
scotland
and
co
limerick
in
ireland
the
rocks
consist
chiefly
of
basalt
dolerite

volcanic
rocks
of
devonian

in
the
south
of

also
at

and
amongst
the

of
this
stage
are
only
known
in
ireland
on
the
borders
of
mayo
and
galway
west
of
lough

and
at
the
extreme
headland
of
the
dingle
promontory
in
kerry

consist
of
porphyrites
felstones
and

silurian
volcanic
action
was
developed
on
a
grand
scale
during
the
arenig
and
stages
both
in
wales
and
the
lake
district
and
in
the
llandeilo
stage
in
the
south
of
scotland
the
felspathic
lavas
with
their
associated
beds
of

rise
into

of
the
grandest
mountain
crests
of
north
wales
such
as
those
of

and

a
similar
series
is
also
represented
in
ireland
ranging
from
wicklow
to
waterford
forming
a
double
group
of
felstones
porphyries
breccias
and
with

of

the

again
appears
amidst
the

drogheda
series
presumably
of
lower
silurian
if
as
seems
highly
probable
the
great
metamorphic
series
of
donegal
and
derry
are
the
representatives
in
time
of
the
lower
silurian
series
some
of
the
great
sheets
of
felspathic
and
hornblendic
trap
which
they
contain
are
referable
to
this
epoch
these
rocks
have
undergone
a
change
in
structure
along
with
the
sedimentary
strata
of
which
they
were
originally
formed
so
that
the
sheets
of
presumably
augitic

have
been
converted

find
the
volcanic

presumably
of

various
felstones
porphyries

are
found
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
every
epoch
from
the
earliest
stage
of
the
cambrian
to
the
permian
in
the
british
isles
gives
evidence
of
the
existence
of
volcanic
action
from
which
we
may
infer
that
the
originating
cause
whatever
it
may
be

this

is
a
region
where
volcanic

is
constant
and
where
the
outbursts
are
exceptionally
violent

this
is
probably
the
most
active
volcanic

in

and
the
recent
terrible
earthquake

gives
proof
that
the
volcanic
forces
are
as
powerful
and
destructive
as
ever
condition
down
to
down
to
the
year
this
island
although
from
its
form
and
structure
evidently
volcanic
appears
to
have
been
in
a
dormant
state
its
sides
were
covered
with
luxuriant
forests
and
numerous
habitations
dotted
its
shore
but
in
may
of
that
year
an
eruption
occurred
owing
to
which
the
aspect
of
krakatoa
as
described
by
vogel
was
entirely
changed
the
surface
of
the
island
when
this
writer
passed
on
his

to
sumatra

burnt
up

arid
while
blocks
of
incandescent
rock
were
being
hurled
into
the

for

which
issued
from

extremity
there
was
no

itself

the
inhabitants

of

and
neighbouring
localities
were
surprised
by
a
confused
noise
mingled
with
detonations

the

the
phenomena
commenced
between
ten
and
eleven
in
the
morning
and
soon
acquired
such
intensity
as
to
cause
general
alarm
the
detonations
were
accompanied
by
tremblings
of
the
ground
of
buildings
and
various
objects
contained
in
dwellings
but
it
was
generally
admitted
that
these
did
not
proceed
from
earthquake
shocks
but
from
atmospheric
vibrations
no
deviation
of
the
magnetic
needle
was
observed
at
the
meteorological
institute
of
batavia
but
a
vertical
oscillation
was
apparent
and
persons
who
listened
with
the
ear
placed
on
the
ground
even
during
the
most
violent
detonations
could
hear
no
subterranean
noise
whatever
it
became
clear
that
the
sounds
came
from
some
volcano
burst
into
activity
but
it
is
strange
that
for
two
whole
days
it
remained
uncertain
what
was
the
particular
volcano
to
which
the
phenomena
were
to
be
referred
the
detonations
appeared
indeed
to
come
from
the
direction
of
krakatoa
but
from
serang
anjer
and
merak
localities
situated
much
nearer
krakatoa
than
batavia
the
telegraph
announced
that
neither
detonations
nor
atmospheric
vibrations
had
been
perceived
the
distance
between
batavia
and
krakatoa
is
english
miles
the
doubts
thus
experienced
were
however
soon
put
to
rest
by
the
arrival
of
an
american
vessel
under
the
command
of
thomas
and
of
other
ships
which
hailed
from
the
straits
of
sunda
from
their
accounts
it
was
ascertained
that
in
the
direction
of
krakatoa
the
heavens
were
clouded
with
ashes
and
that
a
grand
column
of
smoke
illumined
from
time
to
time
by
flashes
of
flame
arose
from
above
the
island

after
a
repose
of
more
than
two
hundred
years
the
peaceable
isle
of

inhabited
and
covered
by
thick
forests
was

awakened
from

island
of
krakatoa
consisted
of
three
mountains
or
groups
of
mountains
figs
the
southern
formed
by
the
cone
of
rakata
properly
so
called
rising
with
a
scarped
face
above
the
sea
to
a
height
of
over
mètres
feet
adjoining
this
cone
and
rising
from
the
centre
of
the
island
came
the
group
of
danan
composed
of
many
summits
probably
forming
part
of
the
of
a
crater
and
near
the
northern
extremity
of
the
isle
a
third
group
of
mammelated
heights
could
be
recognised
under
the
general
name
of
perboewatan
from
which
issued
several
obsidian
with
a
steep
slope
these
dated
back
perhaps
to
the
period
of
the
first
known
eruption
of
this
large
and
mountainous
island
as
it
existed
at
the
beginning
of
may
has
been
entirely
destroyed
by
the
terrible
eruptions
of
that
year
with
the
exception
of
the
peripheric
rim
composed
of
the
most
ancient
of
the
volcanic
rocks
andesite
of
which
verlaten
island
and
rakata
formed
a
part
and
one
very
small
islet
which
is
noted
on
the
maps
as
rots
rock
and
on
the
new
map
of
the
straits
of
sunda
of
the
dutch
navy
as
that
of
bootsmansrots
as
shown
by
the
map
in
the
report
of
the
royal
society
the
group
of
islands
which
existed
previous
to
were
but
the
unsubmerged
portions
of
one
vast
volcanic
crater
built
up
of
a
remarkable
variety
of
lava
allied
to
the
andesite
of
the
java
volcanoes
but
having
a
larger
percentage
of
silica
and
hence
falling
under
the
head
of
that
these
volcanic
rocks
are
of
very
recent
origin
is
shown
by
the
fact
ascertained
by
verbeek
that
beneath
them
occur
deposits
of
age
and
that
these
in
turn
rest
on
the
tertiary
strata
which
are
widely
distributed
through
sumatra
java
and
the
adjoining
islands
according
to
the
reasoning
of
professor
judd
the
krakatoa
group
at
an
early
period
of
its
history
presented
the
form
of
a
magnificent
several
miles
in
circumference
at
the
base
which
subsequent
eruptions
shattered
into
fragments
or
blew
into
the
air
in
the
form
of
dust
ashes
and
blocks
of
lava
while
the
central
part
collapsed
and
fell
in
leaving
a
vast
circular
ring
like
the
ancient
crater
of
somma
see
fig
and
he
supposes
the
former
eruptions
to
have
been
on
a
scale
exceeding
in
magnificence
those
which
have
caused
such
interest
within
the
last
few
years
of
to
of
it
was
as
we
have
seen
in
the
month
of
may
that
in
the
language
of
chev
verbeek
the
volcano
of
krakatoa
chose
to
announce
in
a
high
voice
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
archipelago
that
although
almost
nothing
amongst
the
many
colossal
volcanic
mountains
of
the
indies
it
yielded
to
none
of
them
in
regard
to
its
power
these
eruptions
were
however
only
premonitory
of
the
tremendous
and
terrible
explosion
which
was
to
commence
on
sunday
the
of
august
and
which
continued
for
several
days
subsequently
a
little
after
noon
of
that
day
a
rumbling
noise
accompanied
by
short
and
feeble
explosions
was
heard
at
buitenzorg
coming
from
the
direction
of
krakatoa
and
similar
sounds
were
heard
at
anjer
and
batavia
a
little
later
soon
these
detonations
augmented
in
intensity
especially
about
five
in
the
evening
and
news
was
afterwards
received
that
the
sounds
had
been
heard
in
the
isle
of
java
these
sounds
increased
still
more
during
the
night
so
that
few
persons
living
on
the
west
side
of
the
isle
of
java
were
able
to
sleep
at
seven
in
the
morning
there
came
a
crash
so
formidable
that
those
who
had
hoped
for
a
little
sleep
at
buitenzorg
leaped
from
their
beds
meanwhile
the
sky
which
had
up
to
this
time
been
clear
became
overcast
so
that
by
ten
it
became
necessary
to
have
recourse
to
lamps
and
the
air
became
charged
with
vapour
occasional
shocks
of
earthquake
were
now
felt
darkness
became
general
all
over
the
straits
and
the
bordering
coasts
showers
of
ashes
began
to
fall
the
repeated
shocks
of
earthquake
and
the
rapid
discharges
of
subterranean
artillery
all
combined
to
show
that
an
eruption
of
even
greater
violence
than
that
of
may
was
in
progress
at
the
isle
of
krakatoa
but
the
most
interested
witnesses
to
this
terrible
outburst
were
those
on
board
the
ships
plying
through
the
straits
amongst
these
was
the
a
british
vessel
under
the
command
of
captain
watson
this
ship
was
ten
miles
south
of
the
volcano
on
sunday
afternoon
and
therefore
well
in
sight
of
the
island
at
the
time
when
the
volcano
had
entered
upon
its
paroxysmal
state
of
action
captain
watson
describes
the
island
as
being
covered
by
a
dense
black
cloud
while
sounds
like
the
discharges
of
artillery
occurred
at
intervals
of
a
second
of
time
and
a
crackling
noise
probably
arising
from
the
impact
of
fragments
of
rock
ascending
and
descending
in
the
atmosphere
was
heard
by
those
on
board
these
appearances
became
so
threatening
towards
five
in
the
evening
that
the
commander
feared
to
continue
his
voyage
and
began
to
shorten
sail
from
five
to
six
a
rain
of
pumice
in
large
pieces
quite
warm
fell
upon
the
ship
which
was
one
of
those
that
escaped
destruction
during
this
terrible
night
during
this
eruption
electrical
phenomena
of
great
splendour
were
observed
captain
wooldbridge
viewing
the
eruption
in
the
afternoon
of
the
from
a
distance
of
forty
miles
speaks
of
a
great
looking
like
an
immense
wall
being
momentarily
lighted
up
by
bursts
of
forked
lightning
like
large
serpents
rushing
through
the
air
after
sunset
this
dark
wall
resembled
a
curtain
with
edges
of
all
shades
of
yellow
the
whole
of
a
murky
tinge
through
which
gleamed
fierce
flashes
of
lightning
as
professor
judd
observes
the
abundant
generation
of
atmospheric
electricity
is
a
familiar
phenomenon
in
all
volcanic
eruptions
on
a
grand
scale
the
rushing
through
the
orifices
of
the
crust
constitute
an
enormous
engine
and
the
friction
of
the
ejected
materials
striking
against
one
another
in
their
ascent
and
descent
also
does
much
in
the
way
of
generating
electricity
it
has
been
estimated
by
several
observers
that
the
column
of
watery
vapour
ascended
to
a
height
of
from
twelve
to
seventeen
and
even
miles
and
on
reaching
the
upper
strata
of
the
atmosphere
it
spread
itself
out
in
a
vast
canopy
resembling
the
form
of
vesuvian
eruptions
and
throughout
the
long
night
of
the
this
canopy
continued
to
extend
laterally
and
the
particles
of
dust
which
it
enclosed
began
to
descend
slowly
through
the
air
of
this
tremendous
outburst
of
volcanic
forces
which
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
influenced
the
entire
surface
of
the
globe
gave
rise
to
waves
which
traversed
both
air
and
ocean
and
in
consequence
of
the
large
number
of
observatories
scattered
all
over
the
globe
and
the
excellence
and
delicacy
of
the
instruments
of
observation
we
are
put
in
possession
of
the
remarkable
results
which
have
been
obtained
from
the
collection
of
the
observations
in
the
hands
of
competent
specialists
the
results
are
related
in
the
report
of
the
royal
society
illustrated
by
maps
and
diagrams
and
are
worthy
of
careful
study
by
those
interested
in
terrestrial
phenomena
a
brief
summary
is
all
that
can
be
given
here
but
it
will
probably
suffice
to
bring
home
to
the
reader
the
magnitude
and
grandeur
of
the
eruption
the
vibrations
or
waves
generated
in
august
at
krakatoa
may
be
arranged
under
three
heads
atmospheric
waves
sound
waves
and
oceanic
waves
which
i
will
touch
upon
in
the
order
here
stated
these
phenomena
have
been
ably
handled
by
general
strachey
from
a
large
number
of
observations
extending
all
over
the
globe
from
these
it
has
been
clearly
established
that
an
atmospheric
wave
originating
at
krakatoa
as
a
centre
expanded
outwards
in
a
circular
form
and
travelled
onwards
till
it
became
a
great
circle
at
a
distance
of
degrees
from
its
point
of
origin
after
which
it
still
advanced
but
now
gradually
contracting
to
a
node
at
the
antipodes
of
krakatoa
that
is
to
say
at
a
point
over
the
surface
of
north
america
situated
in
lat
and
long
or
thereabout
having
attained
this
position
the
wave
was
reflected
or
reproduced
expanding
outwards
for
degrees
and
travelling
backwards
again
to
krakatoa
from
which
it
again
started
and
returning
to
its
original
form
again
overspread
the
globe
this
wonderful
repetition
due
to
the
spherical
form
of
the
earth
was
observed
no
fewer
than
seven
times
though
with
such
diminished
force
as
ultimately
to
be
outside
the
range
of
observation
by
the
most
sensitive
instruments
it
is
one
of
the
triumphs
of
modern
scientific
appliances
that
the
course
of
such
a
wave
generated
in
a
fluid
surrounding
a
globe
which
might
be
demonstrated
on
mathematical
principles
has
been
actually
determined
by
experiments
carried
on
over
so
great
an
area
if
the
produced
at
the
time
of
maximum
eruption
were
not
quite
as
as
those
of
the
air
they
were
certainly
sufficiently
surprising
to
be
almost
incredible
were
it
not
that
they
rest
both
as
regards
time
and
character
upon
incontestible
authority
the
sound
of
the
eruption
resembling
that
of
the
discharge
of
artillery
was
heard
not
only
over
nearly
all
parts
of
sumatra
java
and
the
coast
of
borneo
opposite
the
straits
of
sunda
but
at
places
over
two
thousand
miles
distant
from
the
scene
of
the
explosions
detailed
accounts
collected
with
great
care
are
given
in
the
report
of
the
royal
society
from
which
the
following
are
selected
as
examples
at
the
port
of
acheen
at
the
northern
extremity
of
sumatra
distant
miles
it
was
supposed
that
the
port
was
being
attacked
and
the
troops
were
put
under
arms
at
singapore
distant
miles
two
steamers
were
dispatched
to
look
out
for
the
vessel
which
was
supposed
to
be
firing
guns
as
signals
of
distress
at
bankok
in
siam
distant
miles
the
report
was
heard
on
the
as
also
at
labuan
in
borneo
distant
miles
at
places
in
the
philippine
islands
distant
about
miles
detonations
were
heard
on
the
at
the
time
of
the
eruption
the
above
places
lie
northwards
of
krakatoa
in
the
opposite
direction
we
have
the
following
examples
at
perth
in
western
australia
distant
miles
sounds
as
of
guns
firing
at
sea
were
heard
and
at
the
victorian
plains
distant
about
miles
similar
sounds
were
heard
in
south
australia
at
alice
springs
undoolga
and
other
places
at
distances
of
over
miles
the
sounds
of
the
eruption
were
also
heard
in
a
westerly
direction
at
dutch
bay
ceylon
distant
miles
the
sounds
were
heard
between
and
on
the
morning
of
the
of
august
lastly
at
the
chagos
islands
distant
miles
the
detonations
were
audible
between
and
of
the
same
day
some
of
the
above
distances
are
so
great
that
we
may
fail
to
realise
them
but
they
will
be
more
easily
appreciated
perhaps
if
we
change
the
localities
to
our
own
side
of
the
globe
and
take
two
or
three
cases
with
similar
distances
then
if
the
eruption
had
taken
place
amongst
the
volcanoes
of
the
canaries
the
detonations
would
have
been
heard
at
gibraltar
at
lisbon
at
portsmouth
southampton
cork
and
probably
at
dublin
and
liverpool
or
again
supposing
the
eruption
had
taken
place
on
the
coast
of
iceland
the
report
would
have
been
heard
all
over
the
western
and
northern
coasts
of
the
british
isles
as
well
as
at
amsterdam
and
the
hague
the
enormous
distance
to
which
the
sound
travelled
in
the
case
of
krakatoa
was
greatly
due
to
the
fact
that
the
explosions
took
place
at
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
the
sound
was
carried
along
that
surface
uninterruptedly
to
the
localities
recorded
a
range
of
mountains
intervening
would
have
cut
off
the
at
a
comparatively
short
distance
from
its
source
as
may
be
supposed
the
eruption
gave
rise
to
great
agitation
of
the
ocean
waters
with
various
degrees
of
vertical
oscillation
but
according
to
the
conclusions
of
captain
wharton
founded
on
numerous
data
the
greatest
wave
seems
to
have
originated
at
krakatoa
about
on
the
of
august
rising
on
the
coasts
of
the
straits
of
sunda
to
a
height
of
fifty
feet
above
the
ordinary
this
wave
appears
to
have
been
observed
over
at
least
half
the
globe
it
travelled
westwards
to
the
coast
of
hindostan
and
southern
arabia
ultimately
reaching
the
coasts
of
france
and
england
eastwards
it
struck
the
coast
of
australia
new
zealand
the
sandwich
islands
alaska
and
the
western
coast
of
north
america
so
that
it
was
only
the
continent
of
north
and
south
america
which
formed
a
barrier
and
that
not
absolute
to
the
circulation
of
this
oceanic
wave
all
over
the
globe
the
destruction
to
life
and
property
caused
by
this
wave
along
the
coasts
of
sunda
was
very
great
combined
with
the
earthquake
shocks
which
however
were
not
very
severe
the
tremendous
storm
of
wind
the
fall
of
ashes
and
cinders
and
the
changes
in
the
it
produced
in
the
straits
of
sunda
for
some
time
after
the
eruption
a
disastrous
transformation
lighthouses
had
been
swept
away
all
the
old
familiar
landmarks
on
the
shore
were
obscured
by
a
vast
deposit
of
volcanic
dust
the
sea
itself
was
encumbered
with
enormous
quantities
of
floating
pumice
in
many
places
of
such
thickness
that
no
vessel
could
force
its
way
through
them
and
for
months
after
the
eruption
one
of
the
principal
channels
was
greatly
obstructed
by
two
islands
which
had
arisen
in
its
midst
the
sebesi
channel
was
completely
blocked
by
banks
composed
of
volcanic
materials
and
two
portions
of
these
banks
rose
above
the
sea
as
islands
which
received
the
name
of
steers
island
and
calmeyer
island
but
these
by
the
action
of
the
waves
have
since
been
completely
swept
away
and
the
materials
strewn
over
the
bed
of
the
sea
but
the
face
of
nature
even
in
her
most
terrific
and
repulsive
aspect
is
seldom
altogether
unrelieved
by
some
traces
of
beauty
in
contrast
to
the
fearful
and
disastrous
phenomena
just
described
is
to
be
placed
the
splendour
of
the
heavens
witnessed
all
over
the
central
regions
of
the
globe
throughout
a
period
of
several
months
after
the
eruption
of
which
has
been
ably
treated
by
the
hon
rollo
russell
and
archibald
in
the
royal
report
when
the
particles
of
lava
and
ashes
mingled
with
vapour
were
projected
into
the
air
with
a
velocity
greater
than
that
of
a
ball
discharged
from
the
largest
armstrong
gun
these
materials
were
carried
by
the
prevalent
in
a
westerly
direction
and
some
of
them
fell
on
the
deck
of
ships
sailing
in
the
indian
ocean
as
far
as
long
as
in
the
case
of
the
on
which
the
particles
fell
on
the
of
august
at
a
distance
of
miles
from
krakatoa
but
far
beyond
this
limit
the
finer
particles
of
dust
or
rather
minute
crystals
of
felspar
and
other
minerals
mingled
with
vapour
of
water
were
carried
by
the
higher
currents
of
the
air
as
far
as
the
seychelles
and
africa
not
only
the
east
coast
but
also
the
west
as
cape
coast
castle
on
the
gold
coast
to
paramaribo
trinidad
panama
the
sandwich
isles
ceylon
and
british
india
at
all
of
which
places
during
the
month
of
september
the
sun
assumed
tints
of
blue
or
green
as
did
also
the
moon
just
before
and
after
the
appearance
of
the
stars
and
from
the
latter
end
of
september
and
for
several
months
the
sky
was
remarkable
for
its
magnificent
coloration
passing
from
crimson
through
purple
to
yellow
and
melting
away
in
azure
tints
which
were
visible
in
europe
and
the
british
isles
while
a
large
corona
was
observed
round
both
the
sun
and
moon
these
beautiful
sky
effects
were
objects
of
general
observation
throughout
the
latter
part
of
the
year
and
commencement
of
the
following
year
the
explanation
of
these
phenomena
may
be
briefly
stated
the
fine
particles
consisting
for
the
most
part
of
translucent
crystals
or
fragments
of
crystals
formed
a
canopy
high
up
in
the
atmosphere
being
gradually
spread
over
both
sides
of
the
equator
till
it
formed
a
broad
belt
through
which
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
moon
were
refracted
towards
dawn
and
sunset
they
were
refracted
and
reflected
from
the
facets
of
the
crystal
and
thus
underwent
decomposition
into
the
prismatic
colours
as
do
the
rays
of
the
sun
when
refracted
and
reflected
from
the
particles
of
moisture
in
a
the
subject
is
one
which
can
not
be
fully
dealt
with
here
and
is
rather
outside
the
scope
of
this
work
of
the
the
ultimate
cause
of
volcanic
eruptions
is
treated
in
a
subsequent
chapter
nor
is
that
of
krakatoa
essentially
different
from
others
it
was
remarkable
however
both
for
the
magnitude
of
the
forces
evoked
and
the
stupendous
scale
of
the
resulting
phenomena
it
is
evident
that
water
played
an
important
part
in
these
phenomena
though
not
as
the
prime
mover
any
more
than
water
in
the
boiler
of
a
locomotive
is
the
prime
mover
in
the
generation
of
the
steam
without
the
fuel
in
the
furnace
the
steam
would
not
be
produced
and
the
amount
of
steam
generated
will
be
proportional
to
the
quantity
and
heat
of
the
fuel
in
the
furnace
and
the
quantity
of
water
in
the
boiler
in
the
case
of
krakatoa
both
these
elements
were
enormous
and
inexhaustible
the
volcanic
chimney
or
system
of
chimneys
being
situated
on
an
island
was
readily
accessible
to
the
waters
of
the
ocean
when
fissures
gave
them
access
to
the
interior
molten
matter
that
such
fissures
were
opened
we
may
well
believe
the
earthquakes
which
occurred
at
the
beginning
of
may
and
later
on
on
the
of
that
month
may
indicate
movements
of
the
crust
by
which
water
gained
access
it
appears
that
in
may
the
only
crater
in
a
state
of
activity
was
that
of
perboewatan
in
june
another
crater
came
into
action
connected
with
danan
in
the
centre
of
the
island
and
in
august
a
third
burst
forth
thus
there
was
progressive
activity
up
to
the
commencement
of
the
grand
eruption
of
the
of
that
month
during
this
last
paroxysmal
stage
the
centre
of
the
island
gave
way
and
sunk
down
when
the
waters
of
the
ocean
gained
free
access
and
meeting
with
the
columns
of
molten
matter
rising
from
below
originated
the
prodigious
masses
of
steam
which
rose
into
the
air
of
the
the
detonations
which
accompanied
the
last
great
eruption
are
repeatedly
referred
to
in
all
the
accounts
these
may
have
been
due
not
only
to
the
sudden
explosions
of
steam
directly
produced
by
the
ocean
water
coming
in
contact
with
the
molten
lava
but
by
dissociation
of
the
vapour
of
water
at
the
critical
point
of
temperature
into
its
elements
of
oxygen
and
hydrogen
the
reunion
of
these
elements
at
the
required
temperature
would
also
result
in
explosions
the
phenomena
attending
this
great
volcanic
eruption

earthquakes
of
earthquakes
with
volcanic
the
connection
between
earthquake
shocks
and
volcanic
eruptions
is
now
so
generally
recognised
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
insist
upon
it
here
all
volcanic
districts
over
the
globe
are
specially
liable
to
vibrations
of
the
crust
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
to
be
recollected
that
these
movements
visit
countries
occasionally
from
which
volcanoes
either
recent
or
extinct
are
absent
in
which
cases
we
may
consider
earthquake
shocks
to
be
abortive
attempts
to
originate
volcanic
action
from
the
numerous
observations
which
have
been
made
regarding
the
nature
of
these
phenomena
by
hopkins
lyell
and
others
it
seems
clearly
established
that
earthquakes
have
their
origin
in
some
sudden
impact
of
gas
steam
or
molten
matter
impelled
by
gas
or
steam
under
high
pressure
beneath
the
solid
crust
how
such
impact
originates
we
need
not
stop
to
inquire
as
the
cause
is
closely
connected
with
that
which
produces
volcanic
eruptions
the
effect
however
of
such
impact
is
to
originate
a
wave
of
translation
through
the
crust
travelling
outwards
from
the
point
or
focus
on
the
surface
immediately
over
the
point
of
impact
these
waves
of
translation
can
in
some
cases
be
laid
down
on
a
map
and
are
called
isoseismal
curves
each
curve
representing
approximately
an
equal
degree
of
seismal
intensity
as
shown
on
the
chart
of
a
part
of
north
america
affected
by
the
great
charleston
earthquake
fig
hopkins
has
shown
that
the
when
it
passes
through
rocks
differing
in
density
and
elasticity
changes
in
some
degree
not
only
its
velocity
but
its
direction
being
both
refracted
and
reflected
in
a
manner
analogous
to
that
of
light
when
it
passes
from
one
medium
to
another
of
different
density
when
a
shock
traverses
the
crust
through
a
thickness
of
several
miles
it
will
meet
with
various
kinds
of
rock
as
well
as
with
fissures
and
plications
of
the
strata
owing
to
which
its
course
will
be
more
or
less
modified
of
during
earthquake
movements
fissures
may
be
formed
in
the
crust
and
filled
with
gaseous
or
melted
matter
which
may
not
in
all
cases
reach
the
surface
and
on
the
principle
that
volcanoes
are
for
regions
beyond
their
immediate
influence
we
may
infer
that
the
earthquake
shock
which
generally
precedes
the
outburst
of
a
volcano
long
dormant
finds
relief
by
the
eruption
which
follows
so
that
whatever
may
be
the
extent
of
the
disastrous
results
of
such
an
eruption
they
would
be
still
more
disastrous
if
there
had
been
no
such
as
that
afforded
by
a
volcanic
vent
thus
probably
owing
to
the
extinction
of
volcanic
activity
in
syria
the
earthquakes
in
that
region
have
been
peculiarly
destructive
for
example
on
january
the
town
of
safed
west
of
the
jordan
valley
was
completely
destroyed
by
an
earthquake
in
which
most
of
the
inhabitants
perished
the
great
earthquakes
of
aleppo
in
the
present
century
and
of
syria
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
were
of
exceptional
severity
in
that
of
syria
which
took
place
in
and
which
was
protracted
during
a
period
of
three
months
an
area
of
square
leagues
was
affected
accon
saphat
baalbeck
damascus
sidon
tripoli
and
other
places
were
almost
entirely
levelled
to
the
ground
many
thousands
of
human
beings
lost
their
lives
other
examples
might
be
cited
we
have
now
to
return
to
the
phenomena
connected
with
the
transmission
of
the
velocity
of
transmission
through
the
earth
is
very
great
and
several
attempts
have
been
made
to
measure
this
velocity
with
accuracy
the
most
valuable
of
such
attempts
are
those
connected
with
the
charleston
and
riviera
shocks
fortunately
owing
to
the
perfection
of
modern
appliances
and
the
number
of
observers
all
over
the
globe
these
results
are
entitled
to
great
confidence
the
phenomena
connected
with
the
charleston
earthquake
which
took
place
on
the
of
august
are
described
in
great
detail
by
captain
clarence
dutton
of
the
ordnance
corps
the
conclusions
arrived
at
are
that
as
regards
the
depth
of
the
focal
point
this
is
estimated
at
twelve
miles
with
a
probable
error
of
less
than
two
miles
while
as
regards
the
rate
of
travel
of
the
the
estimate
is
in
one
case
about
miles
per
second
and
in
another
about
miles
per
second
on
the
other
hand
in
the
case
of
the
earthquake
of
the
riviera
which
took
place
on
the
of
february
at
local
time
the
vibrations
of
which
appear
to
have
extended
across
the
atlantic
and
to
have
sensibly
affected
the
seismograph
in
the
government
signal
office
at
washington
the
rate
of
travel
was
calculated
at
about
miles
per
hour
less
than
that
determined
in
the
case
of
charleston
but
captain
dutton
claims
and
probably
with
justice
that
the
results
obtained
in
the
latter
case
are
far
more
reliable
than
any
hitherto
arrived
at
when
the
originating
impact
takes
place
under
the
bed
of
the
ocean
either
by
a
sudden
of
the
crust
to
the
extent
let
us
suppose
of
two
or
three
feet
or
by
an
explosion
from
a
submarine
volcano
a
double
wave
is
formed
one
travelling
through
the
crust
the
other
through
the
ocean
and
as
the
rate
of
velocity
of
the
former
is
greatly
in
excess
of
that
of
the
latter
the
results
on
their
reaching
the
land
are
often
disastrous
in
the
extreme
it
is
the
however
which
is
the
more
important
and
calls
for
special
consideration
if
the
impact
takes
place
in
very
deep
water
the
whole
mass
of
the
water
is
raised
in
the
form
of
a
low
dome
sloping
equally
away
in
all
directions
and
it
commences
to
travel
outwards
as
a
wave
with
an
advancing
crest
until
it
approaches
the
coast
and
enters
shallow
water
the
wave
then
increases
in
height
and
the
water
in
front
is
drawn
in
and
relatively
lowered
so
that
on
reaching
a
coast
with
a
shelving
shore
the
form
of
the
surface
consists
of
a
trough
in
front
followed
by
an
advancing
crest
these
effects
may
be
observed
on
a
small
scale
in
the
case
of
a
steamship
advancing
up
a
river
or
into
a
harbour
with
a
narrow
channel
but
are
inappreciable
in
deep
water
or
along
a
precipitous
open
coast
earthquake
of
lisbon
the
disastrous
results
of
a
submarine
earthquake
upon
the
coast
have
never
been
more
terribly
illustrated
than
in
the
case
of
the
earthquake
of
lisbon
which
took
place
on
november
the
inhabitants
had
no
warning
of
the
coming
danger
when
a
sound
like
that
of
thunder
was
heard
underground
and
immediately
afterwards
a
violent
shock
threw
down
the
greater
part
of
their
city

was
the

the
course
of
about
six
minutes

thousand
persons

according
to
the
computation
of
humboldt
a
portion
of
the
earth
surface
four
times
the
extent
of

felt
the
effects
of

facts
regarding

on
the
atlantic
seaboard
of
carolina
at
of
this

the
inhabitants
engaged
in
their
ordinary
occupations
were
startled
by
the
sound
of
a
distant
roar
which
speedily
deepened
in
volume
so
as
to
resemble
the
noise
of
cannon
rattling
along
the
road
spreading
into
an
awful
noise
that
seemed
to
pervade
at
once
the
troubled
earth
below
and
the
still
air
above
at
the
same
time
the
floors
began
to
heave
underfoot
the
walls
visibly
swayed
to
and
fro
and
the
crash
of
falling
masonry
was
heard
on
all
sides
while
universal
terror
took
possession
of
the
populace
who
rushed
into
the
streets
the
black
portion
of
the
community
being
the
most
demonstrative
of
their
terror
such
was
the
commencement
of
the
earthquake
by
which
nearly
all
the
houses
of
charleston
were
damaged
or
destroyed
many
of
the
public
buildings
seriously
injured
or
partially
demolished
the
effects
were
felt
all
over
the
states
as
far
as
the
great
lakes
of
canada
and
the
borders
of
the
rocky
mountains

to
have

curves
concentrated
but
in
the
map
fig
are
combined
into
the

of

curve
the
position
of
these
clearly
shows
that
the
origin
of
the
charleston
earthquake
was
not
submarine
though
occurring

a
short
distance

border

are
drawn
all
over
the

influenced
by
the

as
a
general
result
of
these
detailed
observations
captain
dutton
states
that
there
is
a
remarkable
coincidence
in
the
phenomena
with
those
indicated
by
the
theory
of
as
the
proper
one
for
an
elastic
nearly
homogeneous
solid
medium
composed
of
such
materials
as
we
know
to
constitute
the
rocks
of
the
outer
portions
of
the
earth
but
on
the
other
hand
he
states
that
nothing
has
been
disclosed
which
seems
to
bring
us
any
nearer
to
the
precise
nature
of
the
forces
which
generated
the
disturbance
the
views
of
mallet
briefly
stated
are
somewhat
as
follows
owing
to
the
secular
cooling
of
the
earth
and
the
consequent
lateral
crushing
of
the
surface
this
crushing
from
time
to
time
overcomes
the
resistance
in
which
case
shocks
are
experienced
along
the
lines
of
fracture
and
faulting
by
which
the
crust
is
intersected
these
shocks
give
rise
to
earthquake
waves
and
as
the
crushing
of
the
walls
of
the
fissure
developes
heat
we
have

or
present
times
indicates
the
existence
of
a
general
cause
beneath
the
crust
it
is
true
that
there
are
to
be
found
large
tracts
from
which
volcanic
rocks
except
those
of
great
geological
antiquity
are
absent
such
as
central
russia
the
nubian
desert
and
the
central
states
of
north
america
but
such
absence
by
no
means
implies
the
of
the
forces
which
give
rise
to
volcanic
action
beneath
those
regions
but
only
that
the
forces
have
not
been
sufficiently
powerful
to
overcome
the
resistance
offered
by
the
crust
over
those
particular
tracts
on
the
other
hand
the
similarity
of
volcanic
lavas
over
wide
regions
is
strong
evidence
that
they
are
drawn
from
one
continuous
magma
consisting
of
molten
matter
beneath
the
solid
exterior
crust
of
volcanic
it
has
been
shown
in
a
previous
page
that
volcanic
action
of
recent
or
tertiary
times
has
taken
place
mainly
along
certain
lines
which
may
be
traced
on
the
surface
of
a
map
or
globe
one
of
these
lines
girdles
the
whole
globe
while
others
lie
in
certain
directions
more
or
less
coincident
with
lines
of
flexure
plication
or
faulting
the
isle
of
sumatra
offers
a
remarkable
example
of
the
coincidence
of
such
lines
with
those
of
volcanic
vents
not
only
the
great
volcanic
cones
but
also
the
smaller
ones
are
disposed
in
chains
which
run
parallel
to
the
longitudinal
axis
of
the
island
the
sedimentary
rocks
are
bent
and
faulted
in
lines
parallel
to
the
main
axis
and
also
to
the
chains
of
volcanic
mountains
and
the
observation
holds
good
with
regard
to
different
geological
periods
another
remarkable
case
is
that
of
the
jordan
valley
nowhere
can
the
existence
of
a
great
fracture
and
vertical
displacement
of
the
strata
be
more
clearly
determined
than
along
this
remarkable
line
of
depression
and
it
is
one
which
is
also
coincident
with
a
zone
of
earthquake
and
volcanic
disturbances
lines
generally
lie
along
the
borders
of
the
but
even
where
from
some
special
cause
actual
observation
on
the
relations
of
the
strata
are
precluded
the
general
configuration
of
the
ground
and
the
relations
of
the
boundaries
between
land
and
sea
to
those
of
volcanic
chains
evidently
point
in
many
cases
to
their
mutual
interdependence
the
remarkable
straightness
of
the
coast
of
western
america
and
of
the
parallel
chain
of
the
andes
affords
presumptive
evidence
that
this
line
is
coincident
with
a
fracture
or
system
of
faults
along
which
the
continent
has
been
bodily
raised
out
of
the
waters
of
the
ocean
of
this
elevation
within
very
recent
times
we
have
abundant
evidence
in
the
existence
of
raised
and
oceanic
at
intervals
all
along
the
coast
rising
in
peru
to
a
level
of
no
less
than
feet
above
the
ocean
as
shown
by
alexander
agassiz
such
elevations
probably
occurred
at
a
time
when
the
volcanoes
of
the
andes
were
much
more
active
than
at
present
considered
as
a
whole
these
great
volcanic
mountains
may
be
regarded
as
in
a
dormant
or
partially
moribund
condition
and
if
the
volcanic
forces
have
to
some
extent
lost
their
strength
so
it
would
appear
have
those
of
elevation
of
volcanic
action
in
the
british
in
the
case
of
the
british
islands
it
may
be
observed
that
the
later
tertiary
volcanic
districts
lie
along
very
ancient
depressions
which
may
indicate
zones
of
weakness
in
the
crust
thus
the
antrim
plateau
as
originally
constituted
lay
in
the
lap
of
a
range
of
hills
formed
of
crystalline
or
lower
silurian
rocks
while
the
volcanic
isles
of
the
inner
hebrides
were
enclosed
between
the
solid
range
of
the
archæan
rocks
of
the
outer
hebrides
on
the
one
side
and
the
silurian
and
archæan
ranges
of
the
mainland
on
the
other
and
if
we
go
back
to
the
carboniferous
period
we
find
that
the
volcanic
district
of
the
centre
of
scotland
was
bounded
by
ranges
of
solid
strata
both
to
the
north
and
south
where
the
resistance
to
interior
pressure
from
molten
matter
would
have
been
greater
than
in
the
carboniferous
where
such
molten
matter
has
been
abundantly
extruded
in
all
these
cases
the
outflow
of
molten
matter
was
in
a
direction
somewhat
parallel
to
the
plications
of
the
strata
conditions
under
which
the
volcanic
action
assuming
then
that
the
molten
matter
forming
an
interior
magma
or
shell
is
constantly
exerting
pressure
against
the
inner
surface
of
the
solid
crust
and
can
only
escape
where
the
crust
is
too
weak
owing
to
faults
plications
or
fissures
to
resist
the
pressure
we
have
to
inquire
what
are
the
special
conditions
under
which
outbursts
of
volcanic
matter
take
place
and
what
are
the
general
results
as
regards
the
nature
of
the
dependent
on
those
conditions
of
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
two
chief
conditions
determining
the
nature
of
volcanic
products
considered
in
the
mass
are
the
presence
or
absence
of
water
such
presence
or
absence
does
not
of
course
affect
the
essential
chemical
composition
of
the
but
it
materially
influences
the
form
in
which
the
matter
is
erupted
the
agency
of
water
in
volcanic
eruptions
is
a
very
interesting
and
important
subject
in
connection
with
the
history
of
volcanic
action
and
has
been
ably
treated
by
professor
prestwich
at
one
time
it
was
considered
that
water
was
essential
to
volcanic
activity
and
the
fact
that
the
great
majority
of
volcanic
cones
are
situated
in
the
vicinity
of
the
oceanic
waters
or
of
inland
seas
was
pointed
to
in
confirmation
of
this
theory
but
the
existence
in
western
america
and
other
volcanic
countries
of
fissures
of
eruption
along
which
molten
lava
has
been
extruded
without
explosions
of
steam
shows
that
water
is
not
an
essential
factor
in
the
production
of
volcanic
phenomena
and
as
professor
prestwich
has
clearly
demonstrated
it
is
to
be
regarded
as
an
element
in
volcanic
explosions
rather
than
as
a
prime
cause
of
volcanic
action
the
main
difficulty
he
shows
to
be
and
calculating
the
rate
of
increase
in
the
elastic
force
of
steam
on
descending
to
greater
and
greater
depths
and
reaching
strata
of
higher
and
higher
temperatures
as
compared
with
the
force
of
capillarity
he
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
water
can
not
penetrate
to
depths
of
more
than
seven
or
eight
miles
and
therefore
can
not
reach
the
seat
of
the
eruptive
forces
professor
prestwich
also
points
out
that
if
the
extrusion
of
lava
were
due
to
the
elastic
force
of
vapour
of
water
there
should
be
a
distinct
relation
between
the
discharge
of
the
lava
and
of
the
vapour
whereas
the
result
of
an
examination
of
a
number
of
eruptions
shows
that
the
two
operations
are
not
related
and
are
in
fact
perfectly
independent
sometimes
there
has
been
a
large
discharge
of
lava
and
little
or
no
escape
of
steam
at
other
times
there
have
been
paroxysmal
explosive
eruptions
with
little
discharge
of
lava
even
in
the
case
of
vesuvius
which
is
close
to
the
sea
there
have
been
instances
when
the
lava
has
welled
out
almost
with
the
tranquillity
of
a
of
surface
water
to
molten
lava
during
the
existence
of
water
during
certain
stages
in
eruptions
is
too
frequent
a
phenomena
to
be
lost
sight
of
but
its
presence
may
be
accounted
for
in
other
ways
besides
proximity
to
the
sea
or
ocean
certain
volcanic
mountains
such
as
etna
and
vesuvius
are
built
upon
strata
receiving
their
supplies
from
the
rainfall
of
the
surrounding
country
or
perhaps
partly
from
the
sea
in
addition
to
this
the
ashes
and
scoriæ
of
the
mountain
sides
are
highly
porous
and
rain
or
snow
can
penetrate
and
settle
downwards
around
the
pipe
or
throat
through
which
molten
lava
wells
up
from
beneath
in
such
cases
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
at
the
commencement
of
a
period
of
activity
molten
lava
ascending
through
one
or
more
fissures
and
meeting
with
strata
or
scoriæ
will
convert
the
water
into
steam
at
high
pressure
resulting
in
explosions
more
or
less
violent
and
prolonged
in
proportion
to
the
quantity
of
water
and
the
depth
to
which
it
has
penetrated
in
this
manner
we
may
suppose
that
ashes
scoriæ
and
blocks
of
rock
torn
from
the
sides
of
the
and
hurled
into
the
air
are
piled
around
the
vent
and
accumulate
into
hills
or
mountains
of
conical
form
after
the
explosion
has
exhausted
itself
the
molten
lava
quietly
wells
up
and
fills
the
crater
as
in
the
cases
of
those
of
auvergne
and
syria
and
other
places
we
may
therefore
adopt
the
general
principle
that
in
volcanic
eruptions
water
in
large
quantities
is
present
we
shall
have
built
up
of
ashes
scoriæ
and
pumice
but
where
absent
the
lava
will
be
extravasated
in
sheets
to
greater
or
less
distances
without
the
formation
of
such
cones
or
if
cones
are
fanned
they
will
be
composed
of
solidified
lava
only
easily
distinguishable
from
of
the
first
of
the
interior
reservoir
from
which
lavas
are
we
have
now
to
consider
the
nature
of
the
interior
reservoir
from
which
lavas
are
derived
and
the
physical
conditions
necessary
for
their
eruption
at
the
surface
without
going
back
to
the
question
of
the
original
condition
of
our
globe
we
may
safely
hold
the
view
that
at
a
very
early
period
of
geological
history
it
consisted
of
a
solidified
crust
at
a
high
temperature
enfolding
a
globe
of
molten
matter
at
a
still
higher
temperature
as
time
went
on
and
the
heat
radiated
into
space
from
the
surface
of
the
globe
while
at
the
same
time
slowly
ascending
from
the
interior
by
conduction
the
crust
necessarily
contracted
and
pressing
more
and
more
on
the
interior
molten
magma
this
latter
was
forced
from
time
to
time
to
break
through
the
contracting
crust
along
zones
of
weakness
or
fissures
earth
crust
in
a
state
of
both
exterior
thrust
and
of
interior
as
has
been
shown
by
hopkins
and
more
recently
by
davison
an
exterior
crust
in
such
a
condition
must
eventually
result
in
being
under
a
state
of
horizontal
thrust
towards
the
exterior
and
of
tension
towards
the
interior
surface
for
the
exterior
portion
having
cooled
down
and
consequently
contracted
to
its
normal
state
will
remain
rigid
up
to
a
certain
point
of
resistance
but
the
interior
portion
still
continuing
to
contract
owing
to
the
conduction
of
the
heat
towards
the
exterior
would
tend
to
enter
upon
a
condition
of
tension
as
becoming
too
small
for
the
interior
molten
magma
and
such
a
state
of
tension
would
tend
to
produce
rupture
of
the
interior
part
in
this
manner
fissures
would
be
formed
into
which
the
molten
matter
would
enter
and
if
the
fissures
happened
to
extend
to
the
surface
owing
to
weakness
of
the
crust
or
flexuring
of
the
strata
or
other
cause
the
molten
matter
would
be
extruded
either
in
the
form
of
dykes
or
volcanic
vents
in
this
way
we
may
account
for
the
numerous
dykes
of
trap
by
which
some
volcanic
districts
are
intersected
such
as
those
of
the
north
of
ireland
and
centre
of
scotland
from
the
above
considerations
it
follows
that
the
earth
crust
must
be
in
a
condition
both
of
pressure
or
lateral
thrust
towards
the
exterior
portion
and
of
tension
towards
the
interior
the
former
condition
resulting
in
faulting
and
flexuring
of
the
rocks
the
latter
in
the
formation
of
open
fissures
through
which
lava
can
ascend
under
high
pressure
these
operations
are
of
course
the
attempt
of
the
natural
forces
to
arrive
at
a
condition
of
equilibrium
which
is
never
attained
because
the
processes
are
never
completed
in
other
words
radiation
and
convection
of
heat
are
constantly
proceeding
giving
rise
to
new
forces
of
thrust
and
tension
it
now
remains
for
us
to
consider
what
may
be
the
condition
of
the
interior
molten
magma
and
in
doing
so
we
must
be
guided
to
a
large
extent
by
considerations
regarding
the
nature
of
the
extruded
matter
at
the
surface
densities
of
now
observation
shows
that
as
bearing
on
the
subject
under
consideration
lavas
occur
mainly
under
two
classes
as
regards
their
density
the
most
dense
or
basic
are
those
in
which
silica
is
deficient
but
iron
is
abundant
the
least
dense
or
acid
are
those
which
are
rich
in
silica
but
in
which
iron
occurs
in
small
quantity
this
division
corresponds
with
that
proposed
by
bunsen
and
durocher
for
volcanic
rocks
upon
the
results
of
analyses
of
a
large
number
of
specimens
from
various
districts
rocks
may
be
thus
arranged
in
groups
heavier
poor
in
silica
rich
in
iron
containing
silica
per
cent
examples
basalt
dolerite
hornblende
rock
diorite
diabase
gabbro
melaphyre
and
leucite
lava
lighter
rich
in
silica
poor
in
iron
containing
silica
per
cent
examples
trachyte
rhyolite
obsidian
domite
felsite
granite
the
andesite
group
forms
a
connecting
link
between
the
highly
acid
and
the
basic
groups
and
there
are
many
varieties
of
the
above
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
enumerate
durocher
supposes
that
the
molten
magmas
of
these
various
rocks
are
arranged
in
concentric
shells
within
the
solid
crust
in
order
of
their
respective
densities
those
of
the
lighter
density
namely
the
acid
magmas
being
outside
those
of
greater
density
namely
the
basic
and
this
is
a
view
which
seems
not
improbable
from
a
consideration
not
only
of
the
principle
itself
but
of
the
succession
of
the
varieties
of
lava
in
many
districts
thus
we
find
that
acid
lavas
have
been
generally
extruded
first
and
basic
afterwards
as
in
the
cases
of
western
america
of
antrim
the
rhine
and
central
france
and
if
the
interior
of
our
globe
had
been
in
a
condition
of
equilibrium
from
the
time
of
the
consolidation
of
the
crust
to
the
present
reason
would
induce
us
to
conclude
that
the
lavas
would
ultimately
have
arranged
themselves
in
accordance
with
the
conditions
of
density
beneath
that
crust
but
the
state
of
equilibrium
has
been
constantly
disturbed
every
fresh
outburst
of
volcanic
force
and
every
fresh
extrusion
of
lava
tends
to
disturb
it
and
to
alter
the
relations
of
the
interior
viscous
or
molten
magmas
owing
to
this
it
happens
as
we
may
suppose
that
the
order
of
eruption
according
to
density
is
sometimes
broken
and
we
find
such
rocks
as
granophyre
a
variety
of
andesite
breaking
through
the
of
mull
and
skye
as
explained
in
a
former
chapter
notwithstanding
such
variations
however
the
view
of
durocher
may
be
considered
as
the
most
reasonable
we
can
arrive
at
on
a
subject
which
is
confessedly
highly
conjectural
as
regards
the
ultimate
cause
of
volcanic
notwithstanding
however
the
complexity
of
the
subject
and
the
uncertainties
which
must
attend
an
inquiry
where
some
of
the
data
are
outside
the
range
of
our
observation
sufficient
evidence
can
be
adduced
to
enable
us
to
arrive
at
a
tolerably
clear
view
of
the
ultimate
cause
of
volcanic
action
so
tempting
a
subject
was
sure
to
evoke
numerous
essays
some
of
great
ingenuity
such
as
that
of
mallet
others
of
great
complexity
such
as
that
of
daubeny
but
more
recent
consideration
and
wider
observation
have
tended
to
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
the
ultimate
cause
is
the
most
simple
the
most
powerful
and
the
most
general
which
can
be
suggested
namely
contraction
of
the
crust
due
to
secular
cooling
of
the
more
deeply
seated
parts
by
conduction
and
radiation
of
heat
into
owing
to
this
cause
the
enclosed
molten
matter
is
more
or
less
abundantly
extruded
from
time
to
time
along
the
lines
and
vents
of
eruption
so
as
to
accommodate
itself
to
the
crust
nor
can
we
doubt
that
this
process
has
been
going
on
from
the
very
earliest
period
of
the
earth
history
and
formerly
at
a
greater
rate
than
at
present
when
the
crust
was
more
highly
heated
the
radiation
and
conduction
must
have
been
proportionately
more
rapid
owing
to
this
cause
also
the
contraction
of
the
crust
was
accelerated
to
such
irresistible
force
we
owe
the
wonderful
flexuring
folding
and
horizontal
overthrusting
which
the
rocks
have
undergone
in
some
portions
of
the
globe
such
as
in
the
alps
the
highlands
of
scotland
and
of
ireland
and
the
alleghannies
of
america
it
is
easy
to
show
that
the
acceleration
of
the
rotation
must
be
a
consequence
of
such
contraction
but
after
all
this
is
but
one
of
those
compensatory
forces
of
which
we
see
several
examples
in
the
world
around
us
it
can
also
be
confidently
inferred
that
at
an
early
period
of
the
earth
history
when
the
moon
was
nearer
to
our
planet
than
at
present
the
tides
were
far
more
powerful
and
their
effect
in
retarding
the
earth
rotation
was
consequently
greater
during
this
period
the
acceleration
due
to
contraction
was
also
greater
and
the
two
forces
probably
very
nearly
balanced
each
other
both
these
forces
those
of
acceleration
and
retardation
have
been
growing
weaker
down
to
the
present
day
though
there
appears
to
have
been
a
slight
advantage

the
side

lunar
volcanoes
the
surface
of
the
moon
presented
to
our
view
affords
such
remarkable
indications
of
volcanic
phenomena
of
a
special
kind
that
we
are
justified
in
devoting
a
chapter
to
their
consideration
it
is
very
tantalising
that
our
beautiful
satellite
only
permits
us
to
look
at
and
admire
one
half
of
her
sphere
but
it
is
not
a
very
inference
if
we
feel
satisfied
that
the
other
half
bears
a
general
resemblance
to
that
which
is
presented
to
the
earth
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
inform
the
reader
why
it
is
that
we
never
see
but
one
face
still
for
the
sake
of
those
who
have
not
thought
out
the
subject
i
may
state
that
it
is
because
the
moon
rotates
on
her
axis
exactly
in
the
time
that
she
performs
a
revolution
round
the
earth
if
this
should
not
be
sufficiently
clear
let
the
reader
perform
a
very
simple
experiment
for
himself
which
will
probably
bring
conviction
to
his
mind
that
the
explanation
here
given
is
correct
let
him
place
an
orange
in
the
centre
of
a
round
table
and
then
let
him
move
round
the
table
from
a
sideways
ever
keeping
his
face
directed
towards
the
orange
and
when
he
has
reached
his
he
will
find
that
he
has
rotated
once
round
while
he
has
performed
one
revolution
round
the
table
in
this
case
the
performer
represents
the
moon
and
the
orange
the
earth
now
this
connection
between
the
earth
and
her
satellite
is
sufficiently
close
to
be
used
as
an
argument
if
not
as
actual
demonstration
that
the
earth
and
the
moon
were
originally
portions
of
the
same
mass
and
that
during
some
very
early
stage
in
the
development
of
the
solar
system
these
bodies
parted
company
to
assume
for
ever
after
the
relations
of
planet
and
satellite
at
the
epoch
referred
to
we
may
also
suppose
that
these
two
masses
of
matter
were
in
a
highly
incandescent
if
not
even
gaseous
state
and
we
conclude
therefore
that
having
been
once
portions
of
the
same
mass
they
are
composed
of
similar
materials
this
conclusion
is
of
great
importance
in
enabling
us
to
reason
from
analogy
regarding
the
origin
of
the
physical
features
on
the
moon
surface
and
for
the
purpose
of
comparison
with
those
which
we
find
on
the
surface
of
our
globe
because
it
is
evident
that
if
the
composition
of
the
moon
were
essentially
different
from
that
of
our
earth
we
should
have
no
basis
whatever
for
a
comparison
of
their
physical
features
when
the
moon
started
on
her
career
of
revolution
round
the
earth
we
may
well
suppose
that
her
orbit
was
much
smaller
than
at
present
she
was
influenced
by
counteracting
forces
those
of
gravitation
drawing
her
towards
the
centre
of
gravity
of
the
earth
and
the
centrifugal
force
which
in
the
first
instance
was
the
stronger
so
that
her
orbit
for
a
lengthened
period
gradually
increased
until
the
two
forces
those
of
attraction
and
repulsion
came
into
a
condition
of
equilibrium
and
she
now
performs
her
revolution
round
the
earth
at
a
mean
distance
of
miles
in
an
orbit
which
is
only
very
slightly
elliptical
how
the
period
of
the
moon
rotation
is
regulated
by
the
attraction
on
her
molten
first
at
the
surface
and
now
probably
below
the
outer
crust
has
been
graphically
shown
by
sir
robert
ball
but
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
once
the
moon
was
appreciably
nearer
to
our
globe
than
at
present
the
attraction
of
her
mass
produced
tides
in
the
ocean
of
correspondingly
greater
magnitude
and
capable
of
effecting
results
both
in
eroding
the
surface
and
in
transporting
masses
of
rock
far
beyond
the
bounds
of
our
experience
of
all
the
heavenly
bodies
the
sun
excepted
the
moon
is
the
most
impressive
and
beautiful
as
we
catch
her
form
rising
as
a
fair
crescent
in
the
western
sky
after
sunset
gradually
increasing
in
size
and
brilliancy
night
after
night
till
from
her
circular
disk
she
throws
a
full
flood
of
light
on
our
world
and
then
passes
through
her
decreasing
phases
we
recognise
her
as
the
governor
of
the
night
or
in
the
words
of
our
own
poet
when
in
her
crescent
phase
the
diadem
of
night
seen
through
a
good
binocular
glass
her
form
gains
in
rotundity
but
under
an
ordinary
telescope
with
a
objective
she
appears
like
a
globe
of
molten
gold
yet
all
this
light
is
derivative
and
is
only
a
small
portion
of
that
she
receives
from
the
sun
that
her
surface
is
a
mass
of
rigid
matter
destitute
of
any
inherent
brilliancy
appears
plain
enough
when
we
view
a
portion
of
her
disk
through
a
very
large
telescope
it
was
the
good
fortune
of
the
author
to
have
an
opportunity
for
such
a
view
through
one
of
the
largest
telescopes
in
the
world
the
refractor
manufactured
by
sir
howard
grubb
of
dublin
for
the
vienna
observatory
a
few
years
ago
was
turned
on
a
portion
of
the
moon
disk
before
being
finally
sent
off
to
its
destination
and
seen
by
the
aid
of
such
enormous
magnifying
power
nothing
could
be
more
disappointing
as
regards
the
appearance
of
our
satellite
the
sheen
and
lustre
of
the
surface
was
now
observed
no
longer
the
mountains
and
valleys
the
circular
ridges
and
hollows
were
indeed
wonderfully
defined
and
magnified
but
the
matter
of
which
they
seemed
to
be
constituted
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
the
pale
plaster
of
a
model
one
could
thus
fully
realise
the
fact
that
the
moon
light
is
only
derivative
still
we
must
recollect
that
the
most
powerful
telescope
can
only
bring
the
surface
of
the
moon
to
a
distance
from
us
of
about
miles
and
it
need
not
be
said
that
objects
seen
at
such
a
distance
on
our
earth
present
very
deceptive
appearances
so
that
we
gain
little
information
regarding
the
composition
of
the
moon
crust
or
exterior
surface
simply
from
observation
by
the
aid
of
large
telescopes
reasoning
from
analogy
with
our
globe
we
may
infer
that
the
exterior
shell
of
the
moon
consists
of
crystalline
volcanic
matter
of
the
highly
silicated
or
acid
varieties
resting
upon
another
of
a
denser
description
rich
in
iron
and
resembling
basalt
this
hypothesis
is
hazarded
on
the
supposition
that
the
composition
of
the
matter
of
the
moon
mass
resembles
in
the
main
that
of
our
globe
during
the
process
of
cooling
from
a
molten
condition
the
heavier
lavas
would
tend
to
fall
inwards
and
allow
the
lighter
to
come
to
the
surface
and
form
the
outer
shell
in
both
cases
thus
the
outer
crust
would
resemble
the
trachytic
lavas
of
our
globe
and
their
pale
colour
would
enable
the
sun
rays
to
be
reflected
to
a
greater
extent
than
if
the
material
were
of
the
blackness
of
basalt
so
much
for
the
material
we
have
now
to
consider
the
structure
of
the
moon
surface
and
here
we
find
ourselves
treading
on
less
speculative
and
safer
ground
all
astronomers
since
the
time
of
schroter
seem
to
be
of
accord
in
the
opinion
that
the
remarkable
features
of
the
moon
surface
are
in
some
measure
of
volcanic
origin
and
we
shall
presently
proceed
to
consider
the
character
of
these
forms
more
in
detail
but
first
and
as
leading
up
to
the
discussion
of
these
physical
features
we
must
notice
one
essential
difference
between
the
constitution
of
the
moon
and
of
the
earth
namely
the
absence
of
water
and
of
an
atmosphere
in
the
case
of
the
moon
the
sudden
and
complete
occultation
of
the
stars
when
the
moon
disk
passes
between
them
and
the
place
of
the
observer
on
the
earth
surface
is
sufficient
evidence
of
the
absence
of
air
and
as
no
cloud
has
ever
been
noticed
to
veil
even
for
a
moment
any
part
of
our
satellite
face
we
are
pretty
safe
in
concluding
that
there
is
no
water
or
at
least
if
there
be
any
that
it
is
inappreciable
in
quantity
hence
we
infer
that
there
is
no
animal
or
vegetable
life
on
the
moon
surface
neither
are
there
oceans
lakes
or
rivers
snowfields
or
glaciers
or
cañons
islands
stratified
rocks
nor
volcanoes
of
the
kind
most
prevalent
on
our
own
globe

on

observe
that
there
are
enormous
dark

irregular

more

the

by
almost
innumerable
circular

lofty
conical
mountains
at

only
sinking
below
the
general
outer
surface
of
the
lunar

on
approaching

these
circular
hollows
appear
oval
in
shape
owing
to
their
position
on
the
sphere
and
the
general
aspect
of
those
that
are
visible
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
there
are
large
numbers
of
smaller
craters
too
small
to
be
seen
by
the
most
powerful
telescopes
these
cones
and
craters
are
the
most
characteristic
objects
on
the
whole
of
the
visible
surface
and
when
highly
magnified
present
very
rugged
outlines
suggestive
of
slag
or
lava
which
has
consolidated
on
cooling
as
in
the
case
of
most
solidified
on
our
earth
one
of
the
most
remarkable
of
these
crateriform
mountains
is
that
named
situated
in
a
line
with
the
southern
prolongation
of
the
apennines
of
this
mountain
sir
ball
says
it
is
particularly
well
known
through
sir
john
herschel
drawing
so
beautifully
reproduced
in
the
many
editions
of
the
of
the
region
to
the
west
is
dotted
over
with
innumerable
minute
craterlets
it
has
a
central
mountain
about
feet
in
height
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
terracing
shown
in
its
interior
is
mainly
due
to
the
repeated
alternate
rise
partial
congealation
and
retreat
of
a
vast
sea
of
lava
at
full
moon
it
is
surrounded
by
radiating
streaks
the
view
regarding
the
structure
of
copernicus
here
expressed
is
of
importance
as
it
is
probably
applicable
to
all
the
craters
of
our
satellite
when
the
moon
is
five
or
six
days
old
says
sir
robert
ball
a
beautiful
group
of
three
craters
will
be
readily
found
on
the
boundary
line
between
night
and
day
these
are
and
catharina
is
the
most
southerly
of
the
group
and
is
more
than
feet
deep
and
connected
to
cyrillus
by
a
wide
valley
but
between
cyrillus
and
theophilus
there
is
no
such
connection
indeed
cyrillus
looks
as
if
its
huge
surrounding
ramparts
as
high
as
mont
blanc
had
been
completely
finished
when
the
volcanic
forces
commenced
the
formation
of
theophilus
the
rampart
of
which
encroaches
considerably
on
its
older
neighbour
theophilus
stands
as
a
round
crater
about
miles
in
diameter
with
an
internal
depth
of
to
feet
and
a
beautiful
central
group
of
mountains
of
that
height
on
its
floor
this
proves
that
the
last
eruptive
efforts
in
this
part
of
the
moon
fully
equalled
in
intensity
those
that
had
preceded
them
although
theophilus
is
on
the
whole
the
deepest
crater
we
can
see
in
the
moon
it
has
received
little
or
no
deformation
by
secondary
eruptions
but
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
object
on
the
whole
hemisphere
of
the
moon
is
the
majestic
tycho
which
rises
from
the
surface
near
the
south
pole
and
at
a
distance
of
about
of
the
diameter
of
the
sphere
from
its
margin
its
depth
is
stated
by
ball
to
be
feet
and
its
diameter
miles
but
its
special
distinction
amongst
the
other
volcanic
craters
lies
in
the
streaks
of
light
which
radiate
from
it
in
all
directions
for
hundreds
and
even
thousands
of
miles
stretching
with
superb
indifference
across
vast
plains
into
the
deepest
craters
and
over
the
highest
opposing
ridges
when
the
sun
rises
on
tycho
these
streaks
are
invisible
but
as
soon
as
it
has
reached
a
height
of
to
above
the
horizon
the
rays
emerge
from
their
obscurity
and
gradually
increase
in
brightness
until
full
moon
when
they
become
the
most
conspicuous
objects
on
her
surface
as
yet
no
satisfactory
explanation
has
been
given
of
the
origin
of
these
illuminated
rays
but
i
may
be
permitted
to
add
that
their
form
and
mode
of
occurrence
are
eminently
suggestive
of
gaseous
exhalations
from
the
volcano
illumined
by
the
sun
rays
and
owing
to
the
absence
of
an
atmosphere
spreading
themselves
out
in
all
directions
and
becoming
more
and
more
attenuated
until
they
cease
to
be
visible
the
above
account
will
probably
suffice
to
give
the
reader
a
general
idea
of
the
features
and
inferential
structure
of
the
moon
surface
that
she
was
once
a
molten
mass
is
inferred
from
her
globular
form
but
according
to
chambers
the
most
delicate
measurements
indicate
no
compression
at
the
poles
that
her
surface
has
cooled
and
become
rigid
is
also
a
necessary
inference
though
sir
herschel
considered
that
the
surface
still
retains
a
temperature
exceeding
that
of
boiling
water
however
this
may
be
it
is
pretty
certain
that
whatever
changes
may
occur
upon
her
surface
are
not
due
to
present
volcanic
action
all
evidence
of
such
action
being
admittedly
absent
if
when
the
earth
and
moon
parted
company
their
respective
temperatures
were
equal
the
moon
being
so
much
the
smaller
of
the
two
would
have
cooled
more
rapidly
and
the
surface
may
have
been
covered
by
a
rigid
crust
when
as
yet
that
of
the
earth
may
have
been
molten
from
heat
hence
the
rigidity
of
the
moon
surface
may
date
back
to
an
immensely
distant
period
but
she
may
still
retain
a
high
temperature
within
this
crust
having
arrived
at
this
stage
of
our
narrative
we
are
in
a
position
to
consider
by
what
means
and
under
what
conditions
the
cones
and
craters
which
diversify
the
lunar
surface
have
been
developed
in
doing
so
it
may
be
desirable
in
the
first
place
to
determine
what
form
of
crater
on
our
earth
surface
those
of
the
moon
do
not
represent
and
we
are
guided
in
our
inquiry
by
the
consideration
of
the
absence
of
water
on
the
lunar
surface
now
there
are
large
numbers
of
crateriform
mountains
on
our
globe
in
the
formation
of
which
water
has
played
an
important
indeed
essential
part
as
we
have
already
seen
water
though
not
the
ultimate
cause
of
volcanic
eruptions
has
been
the
chief
agent
when
in
the
form
of
steam
at
high
pressure
in
producing
the
explosions
which
accompany
these
eruptions
and
in
tearing
up
and
hurling
into
the
air
the
masses
of
rock
scoriæ
and
ashes
which
are
piled
around
the
vents
of
eruption
in
the
form
of
craters
during
periods
of
activity
to
this
class
of
craters
those
of
etna
vesuvius
and
auvergne
belong
these
mountains
and
conical
hills
the
domes
excepted
are
all
built
up
of
accumulations
of
fragmental
material
with
occasional
sheets
and
dykes
of
lava
intervening
and
where
eruptions
have
taken
place
in
recent
times
observation
has
shown
that
they
are
accompanied
by
outbursts
of
vast
quantities
of
aqueous
vapour
which
has
been
the
chief
agent
along
with
various
gases
in
piling
up
the
circular
walls
of
the
crater
it
has
also
been
shown
that
in
many
instances
these
have
been
breached
on
one
side
and
that
streams
of
molten
lava
which
once
occupied
the
cup
to
a
greater
or
less
height
have
poured
down
the
mountain
side
hence
the
form
or
outline
of
many
of
these
fragmental
craters
is
such
breached
craters
are
to
be
found
in
all
parts
of
the
world
and
are
not
confined
to
any
one
district
or
even
continent
so
that
they
may
be
considered
as
characteristic
of
the
class
of
volcanic
to
which
i
am
now
referring
in
the
case
of
the
moon
however
we
fail
to
observe
any
decided
instances
of
breached
craters
with
such
as
those
i
have
described
in
nearly
all
cases
the
ramparts
appear
to
extend
continuously
round
the
enclosed
depression
solid
and
unbroken
or
at
least
with
no
large
gap
occupying
a
very
considerable
section
of
the
circumference
see
fig
hence
we
are
led
to
suspect
that
there
is
some
essential
distinction
between
the
craters
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
and
the
greater
number
of
those
on
the
surface
of
our
earth
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
add
that
the
volcanic
mountains
of
the
moon
offer
no
resemblance
whatever
to
the
volcanic
mountains
of
our
globe
if
it
were
otherwise
the
lunar
mountains
would
appear
as
simple
luminous
points
rising
from
a
dark
floor
over
which
they
would
cast
a
conical
shadow
but
the
form
of
the
lunar
volcanic
mountains
is
essentially
different
as
already
observed
they
consist
in
general
of
a
circular
rampart
enclosing
a
depressed
floor
sometimes
terraced
as
in
the
case
of
copernicus
from
which
rise
one
or
more
conical
mountains
which
are
in
effect
the
later
vents
of
eruption
in
our
search
therefore
for
analogous
forms
on
our
own
earth
we
must
leave
out
the
craters
and
domes
of
the
type
furnished
by
the
european
volcanoes
and
their
representatives
abroad
and
have
recourse
to
others
of
a
different
type
is
there
then
we
may
ask
any
type
of
volcanic
mountain
on
our
globe
comparable
with
those
on
the
moon
in
all
probability
there
is
if
the
reader
will
turn
to
the
description
of
the
volcanoes
of
the
hawaiian
group
in
the
pacific
especially
that
of
mauna
loa
as
given
by
professor
dana
and
others
and
compare
it
with
that
of
copernicus
he
will
find
that
in
both
cases
we
have
a
circular
rampart
of
solid
lava
enclosing
a
vast
plain
of
the
same
material
from
which
rise
one
or
more
the
interiors
in
both
cases
are
terraced
so
that
allowing
for
differences
in
magnitude
it
would
seem
that
there
is
no
essential
distinction
between
lunar
craters
and
terrestrial
craters
of
the
type
of
mauna
loa
dana
calls
these
hawaiian
volcanoes
basaltic
basalt
being
the
prevalent
material
of
which
they
are
formed
those
of
the
moon
may
be
composed
of
similar
material
or
otherwise
but
in
either
case
we
may
suppose
they
are
built
up
of
lava
erupted
from
vents
connected
with
the
molten
reservoirs
of
the
interior
thus
we
conclude
that
they
belong
to
an
entirely
different
type
and
have
been
built
up
in
a
different
manner
from
those
represented
by
etna
vesuvius
and
most
of
the
extinct
volcanoes
of
auvergne
the
eifel
and
of
other
districts
considered
in
these
pages
let
us
now
endeavour
to
picture
to
ourselves
the
stages
through
which
the
moon
may
be
supposed
to
have
passed
from
the
time
her
surface
began
to
consolidate
owing
to
the
radiation
of
her
heat
into
space
for
there
is
every
probability
that
some
of
the
craters
now
visible
on
her
disk
were
formed
at
a
very
early
period
of
her
physical
history
when
the
surface
began
to
consolidate
it
must
also
have
contracted
and
the
interior
molten
matter
pressed
out
by
the
contracting
crust
must
have
been
over
and
over
again
extruded
through
fissures
produced
over
the
solidified
surface
until
the
solid
crust
extended
over
the
whole
lunar
surface
and
became
of
considerable
thickness
it
is
from
this
epoch
that
in
all
probability
we
should
date
the
commencement
of
what
may
be
termed
the
volcanic
history
of
the
moon
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
although
the
moon
surface
had
become
solid
its
temperature
may
have
remained
high
for
a
very
long
period
but
the
continuous
radiation
of
the
into
space
would
produce
continuous
contraction
while
the
convection
of
the
interior
heat
would
tend
to
increase
the
thickness
of
the
outer
solid
shell
and
this
ever
pressing
with
increasing
force
on
the
interior
molten
mass
would
result
in
frequent
ruptures
of
the
shell
and
the
extrusion
of
molten
lava
rising
from
below
hence
we
may
suppose
the
of
lava
were
of
frequent
occurrence
for
a
lengthened
period
during
the
early
stage
of
consolidation
of
the
lunar
crust
but
afterwards
these
may
be
supposed
to
have
given
place
to
eruptions
through
pipes
or
vents
resulting
in
the
formation
of
the
circular
craters
which
form
such
striking
and
characteristic
objects
in
the
physical
aspect
of
our
satellite
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
various
physical
features
on
the
lunar
surface
have
all
originated
in
the
same
way
the
great
ranges
of
mountains
previously
described
may
have
originated
by
a
process
of
piling
up
of
immense
masses
of
molten
lava
extruded
from
the
interior
through
vents
or
fissures
while
the
great
hollows
or
seas
are
probably
due
to
the
falling
inwards
of
large
spaces
owing
to
the
escape
of
the
interior
lava
but
it
is
with
the
circular
craters
that
we
are
most
concerned
judging
from
analogy
with
the
present
on
our
globe
we
must
suppose
them
to
be
due
to
the
extrusion
and
piling
up
of
lava
through
central
pipes
followed
in
some
cases
by
the
subsidence
of
the
floor
of
the
crater
it
seems
not
improbable
that
it
was
in
this
way
the
greater
number
of
the
circular
craters
lying
around
tycho
and
dotting
so
large
a
space
round
the
margin
of
the
moon
were
constructed
see
fig
in
general
they
appear
to
consist
of
an
elevated
rim
enclosing
a
depressed
plain
out
of
which
a
central
cone
arises
the
rim
may
be
supposed
to
have
been
piled
up
by
successive
discharges
of
lava
from
a
central
orifice
and
after
the
subsidence
of
the
paroxysm
the
lava
still
in
a
molten
condition
may
have
sunk
down
forming
a
seething
lake
within
the
vast
circular
rampart
as
in
the
case
of
the
hawaiian
volcanoes
the
terraces
observable
within
the
craters
in
some
instances
have
probably
been
left
by
subsequent
eruptions
which
have
not
attained
to
the
level
of
preceding
ones
and
where
a
central
is
seen
to
rise
within
the
caldron
we
may
suppose
this
to
have
been
built
up
by
a
later
series
of
eruptions
of
lava
through
the
original
pipe
after
the
consolidation
of
the
interior
sea
of
lava
the
mamelons
of
the
isle
of
bourbon
and
some
of
the
of
hawaii
appear
to
offer
examples
on
our
earth
surface
of
these
peculiar
forms
such
are
the
views
of
the
origin
of
the
physical
features
of
our
satellite
which
their
form
and
inferred
constitution
appear
to
suggest
they
are
not
offered
with
any
intention
of
dogmatising
on
a
subject
which
is
admittedly
obscure
and
regarding
which
we
have
by
no
means
all
the
necessary
data
for
coming
to
a
clear
conclusion
all
that
can
be
affirmed
is
that
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
in
support
of
them
and
that
they
are
to
some
extent
in
harmony
with
phenomena
within
range
of
observation
on
the
surface
of
our
earth
the
far
greater
effects
of
lunar
vulcanicity
as
compared
with
those
of
our
globe
may
be
accounted
for
to
some
extent
by
the
consideration
that
the
force
of
gravity
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
is
only
of
that
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
hence
the
eruptive
forces
of
the
interior
of
our
satellite
have
had
less
resistance
to
overcome
than
in
the
case
of
our
planet
and
the
erupted
materials
have
been
shot
forth
to
greater
distances
and
piled
up
in
greater
magnitude
than
with
us
we
have
also
to
recollect
that
the
abrading
action
of
water
has
been
absent
from
the
moon
so
that
while
accumulations
of
matter
had
been
proceeding
throughout
a
prolonged
period
over
its
surface
there
was
no
counteracting
agency
of
denudation
at
work
to
modify
or
lessen
the
effects
of
the
ruptive
forces
correctly
speaking
each
attracts
the
other
towards
its
centre
of
gravity
with
a
force
proportionate
to
its
mass
and
inversely
as
the
square
of
the
distance
but
the
earth
being
by
much
the
larger
body
its
attraction
is
far
greater
than
that
of
the
moon
the
variation
in
the
distance
is
only
under
rare
circumstances
miles
but
ordinarily
about
miles
of
the
edition
a
series
of
researches
made
by
zöllner
of
leipzig
led
him
to
assign
to
the
capacity
of
the
a
result
intermediate
between
that
obtained
by
bouguer
which
gave
a
brightness
equal
to
part
of
that
of
the
sun
and
of
wollaston
which
gave
part
we
may
accept
of
zöllner
as
sufficiently
close
so
that
it
would
require
full
moons
to
give
the
same
amount
of
light
as
that
of
the
sun
schroter
however
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
moon
has
an
atmosphere
a
chart
of
the
moon
surface
with
the
names
of
the
principal
physical
features
will
be

in

of
the
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
moon
as
seen
through
a
telescope
appears
in
reversed
position
as

models

at
rare

a

are

on

but
it
is
very
doubtful
if
they
are
to
be
regarded
as
breached
craters
the
number

on
the
moon
was
considered
to
be
until
schroter
increased

have

chapter
iii
are
we
living
in
an
epoch
of
special
volcanic
activity
the
question
which
we
are
about
to
discuss
in
the
concluding
chapter
of
this
volume
is
one
to
which
we
ought
to
be
able
to
offer
a
definite
answer
this
can
only
be
arrived
at
by
a
comparison
of
the
violence
and
extent
of
volcanic
and
seismic
phenomena
within
the
period
of
history
with
those
of
periods
at
first
sight
we
might
be
disposed
to
give
to
the
question
an
affirmative
reply
when
we
remember
the
eruptions
of
the
last
few
years
and
add
to
these
the
volcanic
outbursts
and
earthquake
shocks
which
history
records
the
cases
of
the
earthquake
and
eruption
in
japan
of
november
where
in
one
province
alone
two
thousand
people
lost
their
lives
and
many
thousand
houses
were
levelled
that
of
krakatoa
in
of
vesuvius
in
and
many
others
of
recent
date
which
might
be
named
added
to
those
which
history
records
the
recollection
of
such
cases
might
lead
us
to
conclude
that
our
epoch
is
one
in
which
the
subterranean
volcanic
forces
had
broken
out
with
extraordinary
energy
over
the
earth
surface
still
when
we
come
to
examine
into
the
cases
of
recorded
eruptions
especially
those
of
great
violence
we
find
that
they
are
limited
to
very
special
districts
and
even
if
we
extend
our
retrospect
into
the
later
centuries
of
our
era
we
shall
find
that
the
exceptionally
great
eruptions
have
been
confined
to
certain
permanently
volcanic
regions
such
as
the
chain
of
the
andes
that
of
the
aleutian
kurile
japanese
and
philippine
and
sunda
islands
lying
for
the
most
part
along
the
remarkable
volcanic
girdle
of
the
world
to
which
i
have
referred
in
a
previous
page
add
to
these
the
cases
of
iceland
and
the
volcanic
islands
of
the
pacific
and
we
have
almost
the
whole
of
the
very
active
volcanoes
of
the
world
then
for
the
purposes
of
our
inquiry
we
have
to
ascertain
how
these
active
vents
of
eruption
compare
as
regards
the
magnitude
of
their
operations
with
those
of
the
and
later
tertiary
times
but
before
entering
into
this
question
it
maybe
observed
in
the
first
place
that
a
large
number
of
the
vents
of
eruption
even
along
the
chain
of
the
earth
volcanic
girdle
are
dormant
or
extinct
this
observation
applies
to
many
of
the
great
cones
and
domes
of
the
andes
including
chimborazo
and
other
colossal
mountains
in
ecuador
columbia
chili
peru
and
mexico
the
region
between
the
eastern
rocky
mountains
and
the
western
coast
of
north
america
was
as
we
have
seen
one
over
which
volcanic
eruptions
took
place
on
a
vast
scale
in
later
tertiary
times
but
one
in
which
only
the
of
volcanic
action
are
at
present
in
operation
we
have
also
seen
that
the
chain
of
volcanoes
of
japan
and
of
the
kurile
islands
are
only
active
to
a
slight
extent
as
compared
with
former
times
and
the
same
observation
applies
to
those
of
new
zealand
out
of
volcanoes
in
the
japanese
islands
only
are
now
believed
to
be
active
again
if
we
turn
to
other
districts
we
have
been
considering
we
find
that
in
the
indian
peninsula
in
arabia
in
syria
and
the
holy
land
in
persia
in
abyssinia
and
asia
minor
regions
where
volcanic
operations
were
exhibited
on
a
grand
scale
throughout
the
tertiary
period
and
in
some
cases
almost
down
into
recent
times
we
are
met
by
similar
evidences
either
of
decaying
volcanic
energy
or
of
an
energy
which
as
far
as
surface
phenomena
are
concerned
is
a
thing
of
the
past
lastly
turning
our
attention
to
the
european
area
notwithstanding
the
still
active
condition
of
etna
vesuvius
and
a
few
adjoining
islands
we
see
in
all
directions
throughout
southern
italy
evidences
of
volcanic
operations
of
a
past
time
such
as
extinct
lakes
occupying
the
craters
of
former
volcanoes
and
extensive
deposits
of
tuff
or
streams
of
lava
all
concurring
in
giving
evidence
of
a
period
now
past
when
vulcanicity
was
widespread
over
regions
where
its
presence
is
now
never
felt
except
when
some
earthquake
shock
like
that
of
the
riviera
brings
home
to
our
minds
the
fact
that
the
motive
force
is
still
beneath
our
feet
though
under
restrained
conditions
as
compared
with
a
former
period
similar
conclusions
are
applicable
with
even
greater
force
to
other
parts
of
the
european
area
the
region
of
the
lower
rhine
and
moselle
of
hungary
and
the
carpathians
of
central
france
of
the
north
of
ireland
and
the
inner
hebrides
all
afford
evidence
of
volcanic
operations
at
a
former
period
on
an
extensive
scale
and
the
contrast
between
the
present
physically
silent
and
peaceful
condition
of
these
regions
as
regards
any
outward
manifestations
of
forces
compared
with
those
which
were
formerly
prevalent
can
not
fail
to
impress
our
minds
irresistibly
with
the
idea
that
volcanic
energy
has
exhausted
itself
over
these
tracts
of
the
earth
surface
from
this
general
survey
of
the
present
condition
of
the
surface
as
regards
the
volcanic
operations
going
on
over
it
and
a
comparison
with
those
of
a
preceding
period
we
are
driven
to
the
conclusion
that
however
violent
and
often
disastrous
are
the
volcanic
and
seismic
phenomena
of
the
present
day
they
are
restricted
to
comparatively
narrow
limits
and
that
even
within
these
limits
the
volcanic
forces
are
less
powerful
than
they
were
in
times
the
middle
part
of
the
tertiary
period
appears
in
fact
to
have
been
one
of
extraordinary
volcanic
activity
whether
we
regard
the
wide
area
over
which
this
activity
manifested
itself
or
the
results
as
shown
by
the
great
amount
of
the
erupted
materials
many
of
the
still
active
volcanic
chains
or
groups
probably
had
their
first
beginnings
at
the
period
referred
to
but
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
eruptive
forces
have
become
dormant
or
extinct
with
the
exception
of
the
lavas
of
the
area
which
appear
at
least
partially
to
belong
to
the
close
of
the
cretaceous
epoch
the
specially
volcanic
period
may
be
considered
to
extend
from
the
beginning
of
the
miocene
down
to
the
close
of
the
pliocene
stage
during
the
eocene
stage
volcanic
energy
appears
to
have
been
to
a
great
degree
dormant
but
plutonic
energy
was
gathering
strength
for
the
great
effort
of
the
miocene
epoch
when
the
volcanic
forces
broke
out
with
extraordinary
violence
over
europe
the
british
isles
and
other
regions
and
continued
to
develop
throughout
the
succeeding
pliocene
epoch
until
the
whole
globe
was
surrounded
by
a
girdle
of
fire
the
reply
therefore
to
the
question
with
which
we
set
out
is
very
plain
and
is
to
the
effect
that
the
present
epoch
is
one
of
comparatively
low
volcanic
activity
the
further
question
suggests
itself
whether
the
volcanic
phenomena
of
the
middle
tertiary
period
bear
any
comparison
with
those
of
past
geological
times
this
though
a
question
of
great
interest
is
one
which
is
far
too
large
to
be
discussed
here
and
it
is
doubtful
if
we
have
materials
available
upon
which
to
base
a
conclusion
but
it
may
be
stated
with
some
confidence
in
general
terms
that
the
history
of
the
earth
appears
to
show
that
throughout
all
geological
time
our
world
has
been
the
theatre
of
intermittent
geological
activity
periods
of
rest
succeeding
those
of
action
and
if
we
are
to
draw
a
conclusion
regarding
the
present
and
future
it
would
be
that
owing
to
the
lower
rate
of
secular
cooling
of
the
crust
volcanic
action
ought
to
become
less
powerful
as
the
world
grows
older

let
it
be

in

that
there
is
no

line
between
the
varieties
of

rocks
in
this
as

parts

are
gradations
from

variety
to
the

at
the

time
a
systematic
arrangement
is
not
only
desirable
but
necessary
and
the
most
important
basis
of
arrangement
is
that
founded
on
the
proportion
of
or
quartz
in
the
various
rocks
as
first
demonstrated
by
durocher
and
bunsen
who
showed
that
silica
plays
the
same
part
in
the
inorganic
kingdom
that
carbon
does
in
the
organic

this
hypothesis
which
is
a
very
useful
one

these
authors

all
igneous

volcanic
rocks
into
two
classes
the
basic
and
the
acid
the

containing
from
per
the
latter
per

of
that

there
are
a
few

which
serve
to

the

a
remarkable

to
the

british
acceptation

this
view
is
gradually
giving
place
to
the
german
definition
of
syenite
which
is
a
compound
of
orthoclase
and
hornblende
and
it
may
be
better
to
denominate
the
variety
as
the
diorites
are
abundant
as
sheets
and
dykes
amongst
the
older
palæozoic
and
metamorphic
rocks
and
are
sometimes
exceedingly
rich

in

the

there
can
be
little
doubt
that
amongst
the
metamorphic
rocks
of
galway
mayo
and
donegal
the
great
beds
of
often
columnar
diorite
were
originally
augitic
lavas
which
have
since
undergone
transformation
it
is
very
doubtful
if
diabase
ought
to
be
regarded
as
a
distinct
species
of
igneous
rock
as
it
seems
to
be
simply
an
altered
variety
of
basalt
or
dolerite
in
which
chlorite
a
secondary
has
been
developed
by
the
decomposition
of
the
pyroxene
or
olivine
of

occurs
as
to
the
real
nature

melaphyre
is
a
name
given
to
the
very
dark
varieties
of

in
magnetite
and

porphyrite
or
quartzless
porphyry
a
basic
variety
of
consisting
of
a
felspathic
base
with
distinct
crystals
of
felspar
with
which
there
may
be
others
of
hornblende
mica
or
augite
the
colour
is
generally
red
or
purple
and
it
weathers
into
red
clay
in
contrast
to
the
highly
acid
or
silicated
felsites
which
weather
into
whitish
sand
as
stated
above
this
name
has
been
variously
applied
its
derivation
is
from
syene
assouan
in
egypt
and
the
granitic
rocks
of
that
district
were
called
syenites
under
the
supposition
now
known
to
be
erroneous
that
they
differ
from
ordinary
granites
in
that
they
were
supposed
to
be
composed
of
quartz
felspar
and
hornblende
instead
of
quartz
felspar
and
mica
from
this
it
arose
that
syenite
was
regarded
as
a
variety
of
granite
in
which
the
mica
is
replaced
by
hornblende
and
this
has
generally
been
the
british
view
of
the
question
but
the
german
definition
is
applied
to
an
entirely
different
rock
belonging
to
the
felstone
family
and
according
to
this
classification
syenite
consists
of
a
compound
of
orthoclase
and
hornblende
in
which
quartz
may
or
may
not
be
present
from
this
it
will
be
seen
that
according
to
zirkel
syenite
is
essentially
distinct
from
diorite
in
the
species
of
its
felspar
it
seems
desirable
to
adopt
the
german
view
and
as
regards
diorites
containing
quartz
as
an
accessory
to
apply
to
them
the
name
of
as
stated
above
the
name
syenite
as
used
by
british
geologists
having
arisen
from
a
misconception

rock
allied
to
the

family

is
an
abundant

a
little

may
be
