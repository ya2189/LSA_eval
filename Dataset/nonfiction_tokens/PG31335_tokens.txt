this
volume
is
gratefully
dedicated
by
the
author
preface
to
recur
occasionally
to
the
history
and
ideals
of
our
pioneer
forefathers
will
give
us
a
more
generous
appreciation
of
the
worth
of
our
commonwealth
and
a
firmer
faith
in
our
own
provincial
character
it
is
believed
that
a
more
intimate
knowledge
of
the
political
history
of
our
own
commonwealth
will
not
only
inspire
local
patriotism
but
give
us
a
better
perspective
of
the
political
life
of
the
nation
this
little
volume
was
written
for
publication
by
the
historical
department
of
iowa
upon
the
request
of
charles
aldrich
since
the
work
is
intended
as
a
narrative
essay
it
has
been
thought
best
to
omit
all
citations
to
authorities
for
the
original
sources
upon
which
the
essay
is
largely
based
the
reader
is
referred
to

of

materials
which
have
been
published

the

been
little
more

an

set

on
an
equal

with

original

profoundly
significant
in
our
political
evolution
are
events
such
as
these
they
are
milestones
in
the
progressive
history
of
american
democracy
to
search
out
the
origin
to
note
the
progress
to
point
to
the
causes
and
to
declare
the
results
of
this
marvelous
popular
political
development
in
the
new
world
has
been
the
ambition
of
our
historians
nay
more
the
american
experiment
has
interested
the
talent
of
europe
and
our
political
literature
is
already
enriched
by
de
in
by
von
holst
and
political
history
of
the
united
and
by
bryce
ever
since
its
adoption
the
constitution
of
the
fathers
has
been
the
most
popular
of
constitution
drafters
the
world
over
at
the
same
time
it
is
strangely
true
that
the
real
meaning
the
philosophical
import
of
this
interesting
political
drama
has
scarcely
anywhere
been
more
than
suggested
a
closer
view
reveals
the
fact
that
all
of
the
documents
themselves
have
not
yet
been
edited
nor
the
narrative
fully
told
at
present
there
is
not
a
chapter
of
our
history
that
is
wholly
written
though
the
manuscript
is
worn
with
erasures
to
be
sure
bancroft
has
written
exhaustively
of
the
colonies
fiske
has
illuminated
the
revolution
and
portrayed
the
critical
period
frothingham
has
narrated
the
rise
of
the
republic
parkman
has
vividly
pictured
events
in
the
northwest
mcmaster
has
depicted
the
life
of
the
people
von
holst
has
emphasized
the
importance
of
slavery
rhodes
has
outlined
more
recent
events
and
a
host
of
others
have
added
paragraphs
chapters
monographs
and
volumes
to
the
fascinating
story
of
the
birth
and
development
of
a
democratic
nation
but
where
are
the
classics
of
our
local
history
who
are
the
historians
of
the
commonwealths
these
questions
reveal
great
gaps
in
our
historical
literature
on
the
side
of
the
commonwealths
nor
have
the
omissions
passed
unnoticed
bryce
likens
the
history
of
the
commonwealths
to
a
primeval
forest
where
the
vegetation
is
rank
and
through
which
scarcely
a
trail
has
been
cut
and
yet
it
is
clearly
evident
that
before
the
real
import
of
american
democracy
can
be
divined
the
forest
must
be
explored
and
the
underbrush
cleared
away
this
is
not
a
plea
for
localism
or
particularism
on
the
contrary
it
suggests
the
possibility
of
a
broader
view
of
our
national
life
it
points
to
the
source
of
our
political
ideals
for
nothing
is
more
misleading
than
the
inference
that
the
life
of
our
people
is
summed
up
in
the
census
reports
the
journals
of
congress
and
the
archives
of
the
departments
at
washington
the
real
life
of
the
american
nation
spreads
throughout
commonwealths
it
is
lived
in
the
commonplaces
of
the
shop
the
factory
the
office
the
mine
and
the
farm
through
the
commonwealths
the
spirit
of
the
nation
is
expressed
every
american
community
however
humble
participates
in
the
formation
and
expression
of
that
spirit
thus
the
real
significance
of
the
commonwealth
in
any
philosophical
consideration
depends
not
so
much
upon
its
own
peculiar
local
color
as
upon
the
place
which
it
occupies
in
the
life
and
development
of
the
larger
national
whole
it
is
so
with
iowa
here
within
the
memory
of
men
still
living
a
new
commonwealth
has
grown
to
maturity
has
been
admitted
into
the
union
and
now
by
common
consent
occupies
a
commanding
position
in
national
politics
it
is
moreover
from
the
of
these
larger
relations
that
the
political
and
constitutional
history
of
iowa
will
ultimately
be
interpreted
no
amount
of
interest
in
merely
local
incident
or
narration
of
personal
episode
will
suffice
to
indicate
the
import
of
political
existence
he
who
essays
to
write
the
history
of
this
commonwealth
must
ascend
to
loftier
heights
to
narrate
briefly
the
history
of
the
constitutions
of
iowa
and
therein
to
suggest
perhaps
somewhat
of
the
political
ideals
of
the
people
and
the
place
which
this
commonwealth
occupies
politically
in
the
progressive
history
of
the
larger
commonwealth
of
america
is
the
purpose
of
these
pages
ii
a
definition
definition
is
always
difficult
it
may
be
tiresome
but
when
a
term
has
come
to
have
many
different
meanings
then
no
one
who
seriously
desires
to
be
understood
can
use
it
in
the
title
of
a
text
without
at
least
attempting
a
definition
this
is
true
of
the
word
constitution
which
in
the
literature
of
political
science
alone
has
at
least
three
distinct
meanings
corresponding
to
the
three
points
of
view
that
is
the
philosophical
the
historical
and
the
legal
from
the
of
political
philosophy
the
word
constitution
stands
for
the
fundamental
principles
of
government
it
is
the
sum
of
the
general
and
basic
principles
of
all
political
organization
by
which
the
form
competence
and
limitations
of
governmental
authorities
are
fixed
and
determined
and
of
the
general
and
basic
principles
of
liberty
in
accordance
with
which
the
rights
of
men
living
in
a
social
state
are
ascertained
and
guaranteed
in
short
it
is
the
sum
of
the
ultimate
principles
of
government
but
from
the
of
historical
politics
this
word
has
a
different
connotation
consider
for
example
the
political
literature
that
appears
under
such
headlines
as
constitutional
history
or
the
history
of
constitutional
government
here
constitution
means
not
abstract
philosophic
principles
of
government
but
concrete
political
phenomena
that
is
political
facts
our
constitutional
historians
do
not
as
a
rule
deal
directly
with
the
ultimate
principles
of
government
but
they
are
concerned
rather
with
their
progressive
phenomenal
manifestations
in
the
assembly
the
court
the
office
the
caucus
the
convention
the
platform
the
election
and
the
like
thus
constitutional
history
is
simply
a
record
of
concrete
political
facts
it
is
however
in
the
literature
of
jurisprudence
that
the
term
constitution
is
used
in
accordance
with
an
exact
definition
constitutional
law
or
the
law
of
the
constitution
means
a
very
definite
thing
to
the
jurist
it
stands
at
least
in
america
for
a
written
instrument
which
is
looked
upon
as
the
absolute
rule
of
action
and
decision
for
all
departments
and
officers
of
government
and
in
opposition
to
which
any
act
or
regulation
of
any
such
department
or
officer
or
even
of
the
people
themselves
will
be
altogether
void
in
this
sense
a
constitution
is
a
code
of
that
which
is
fundamental
in
the
law
to
be
sure
this
code
or
text
as
everybody
knows
does
not
provide
for
all
that
is
fundamental
in
government
it
usually
contains
much
that
is
temporary
and
unimportant
but
to
the
american
jurist
all
that
finds
expression
in
the
written
document
labeled
constitution
is
constitutional
law
accordingly
he
defines
the
constitution
as
the
written
or
codified
body
of
fundamental
law
in
accordance
with
which
government
is
instituted
and
administered
it
is
as
a
code
or
text
of
fundamental
law
that
the
word
constitution
is
used
in
the
title
of
these
pages
this
is
not
a
philosophical
discussion
of
the
ultimate
principles
of
our
government
nor
an
outline
of
our
constitutional
history
but
simply
a
narrative
touching
the
written
texts
or
codes
that
have
served
the
people
of
iowa
as
fundamental
law
during
the
past
sixty
years
iii
the
constitution
makers
constitutions
are
not
made
they
grow
this
thought
has
become
a
commonplace
in
current
political
literature
and
yet
the
growth
of
which
men
speak
with
such
assurance
is
directed
that
is
determined
by
the
ideals
of
the
people
members
of
constituent
assemblies
and
constitutional
conventions
neither
manufacture
nor
grow
constitutions
they
simply
formulate
current
political
morality
it
is
in
the
social
mind
back
of
the
convention
back
of
the
government
and
back
of
the
law
that
the
ideals
of
human
right
and
justice
are
conceived
born
and
evolved
a
constitution
is
a
social
product
it
is
the
embodiment
of
popular
ideals
and
so
the
real
makers
of
the
constitutions
of
iowa
were
not
the
men
who
first
in
then
in
and
then
again
in
assembled
in
the
old
stone
capitol
on
the
banks
of
the
iowa
river
the
true
fathers
were
the
people
who
in
those
early
times
from
to
took
possession
of
the
fields
and
forests
and
founded
a
new
commonwealth
they
were
the
pioneers
the
frontiersmen
the
squatters
the
pathfinders
in
our
political
history
aye
they
were
the
real
makers
of
our
fundamental
law
the
first
of
the
iowa
pioneers
crossed
the
mississippi
in
the
early
thirties
they
were
preceded
by
the
bold
explorer
and
the
intrepid
who
in
their
day
dared
much
endured
much
and
through
the
wildernesses
lighted
the
way
for
a
civilization
scarcely
had
their
gone
out
when
the
pioneer
appeared
with
ax
and
ox
and
plow
he
came
to
cultivate
the
soil
and
establish
a
home
he
came
to
stay
the
rapidity
with
which
the
pioneer
population
of
iowa
increased
after
the
war
was
phenomenal
it
grew
literally
by
leaps
and
bounds
men
came
in
from
all
parts
of
the
union
from
the
from
the
east
from
the
south
and
from
the
they
came
from
maine
and
massachusetts
from
new
york
and
pennsylvania
from
virginia
and
the
carolinas
from
georgia
kentucky
and
tennessee
and
from
the
newer
states
of
ohio
and
indiana
it
is
said
that
whole
neighborhoods
came
over
from
illinois
in
lieutenant
albert
lea
thought
that
the
population
had
reached
at
least
sixteen
thousand
souls
but
the
census
reports
give
a
more
modest
number
ten
thousand
five
hundred
when
the
territory
of
iowa
was
established
in
there
were
within
its
limits
thousand
eight
hundred
and
people
eight
years
later
when
the
commonwealth
was
admitted
into
the
union
this
number
had
increased
to
one
hundred
and
two
thousand
three
hundred
and
thus
in
less
than
a
score
of
years
the
pioneers
had
founded
a
new
empire
west
of
the
mississippi
and
such
an
empire
a
land
of
inexhaustible
fertility
a
hundred
thousand
pioneers
with
energy
courage
and
perseverance
scarcely
less
exhaustible
than
the
soil
they
cultivated
in
the
location
of
a
home
the
pioneer
was
usually
discriminating
his
was
not
a
chance
squatting
here
or
there
on
the
prairie
or
among
the
trees
the
necessities
water
and
fuel
led
him
as
a
rule
to
settle
near
a
stream
or
river
and
never
far
from
timber
the
pioneers
settled
in
groups
one
two
three
or
more
families
constituted
the
original
nucleus
of
such
groups
the
groups
were
known
as
communities
or
neighborhoods
they
were
the
original
social
and
political
units
out
of
the
integration
of
which
the
commonwealth
was
later
formed
but
the
vital
facts
touching
the
pioneers
of
iowa
are
not
of
migration
and
settlement
in
political
and
constitutional
evolution
the
emphasis
rests
rather
upon
the
facts
of
character
what
the
pioneers
were
is
vastly
more
important
than
where
they
came
from
or
when
and
where
and
how
they
settled
for
all
law
and
government
rests
upon
the
character
of
the
people
constitutions
being
simply
the
formulated
expressions
of
political
ethics
it
is
in
this
broad
catholic
sense
that
the
ideals
of
pioneer
character
became
the
determining
factors
in
political
evolution
and
the
pioneers
themselves
the
real
makers
of
our
fundamental
law
two
opinions
have
been
expressed
respecting
the
early
settlers
of
iowa
calhoun
stated
on
the
floor
of
congress
that
he
had
been
informed
that
the
iowa
country
had
been
seized
upon
by
a
lawless
body
of
armed
men
clay
had
received
information
of
the
same
nature
and
about
the
same
time
senator
ewing
from
ohio
declared
that
he
would
not
object
to
giving
each
rascal
who
crossed
the
mississippi
one
thousand
dollars
in
order
to
get
rid
of
him
nor
was
the
view
expressed
by
these
statesmen
uncommon
in
that
day
it
was
entertained
by
a
very
considerable
number
of
men
throughout
the
east
and
south
who
looked
upon
the
pioneers
in
general
as
renegades
and
vagabonds
forming
a
lawless
rabble
on
the
outskirts
of
civilization
to
them
the
first
settlers
were
lawless
intruders
on
the
public
domain
land
robbers
fugitives
from
justice
and
idle
and
profligate
characters
squatters
they
held
were
those
who
had
gone
beyond
the
settlement
and
were
wholly
reckless
of
the
laws
either
of
god
or
man
nay
more
they
were
of
the
country
performing
no
duties
either
civil
or
military
in
short
gentlemen
who
had
never
even
visited
the
iowa
frontier
talked
glibly
about
frontier
lawlessness
anarchy
and
crime
such
wholesale
defamation
when
applied
to
the
early
settlers
of
iowa
ought
not
to
be
dismissed
with
a
shrug
the
men
who
made
these
harsh
charges
were
doubtless
honest
and
sincere
but
were
they
mistaken
all
testimony
based
upon
direct
personal
observation
is
overwhelmingly
against
the
opinions
they
expressed
lieutenant
albert
lea
who
had
spent
several
years
in
the
iowa
district
writes
in
that
the
character
of
this
population
is
such
as
is
rarely
to
be
found
in
our
newly
acquired
territories
with
very
few
exceptions
there
is
not
a
more
orderly
industrious
active
painstaking
population
west
of
the
alleghanies
than
is
this
of
the
iowa
district
those
who
have
used
the
name
with
the
idea
of
idleness
and
recklessness
would
be
quite
surprised
to
see
the
systematic
manner
in
which
everything
is
here
conducted
it
is
a
matter
of
surprise
that
about
the
mining
region
there
should
be
so
little
of
the
recklessness
that
is
usual
in
that
sort
of
life
in
peter
engle
writing
from
dubuque
says
the
people
are
all
squatters
but
he
who
supposes
that
settlers
who
are
now
building
upon
fencing
and
cultivating
the
lands
of
the
government
are
lawless
depredators
devoid
of
the
sense
of
moral
honesty
or
that
they
are
not
in
every
sense
as
estimable
citizens
with
as
much
intelligence
regard
for
law
and
social
order
for
public
justice
and
private
rights
as
the
farmers
and
yeomen
of
new
york
and
pennsylvania
has
been
led
astray
by
vague
and
unfounded
notions
or
by
positively
false
information
the
statements
of
lea
and
engle
fairly
represent
the
views
of
those
who
from
actual
personal
contact
were
familiar
with
the
life
and
character
of
the
pioneers
we
may
then
rest
assured
that
the
squatters
of
iowa
were
as
a
class
neither
idle
nor
ignorant
nor
vicious
they
were
representative
pioneers
of
their
day
than
whom
benton
declared
there
was
not
a
better
population
on
the
face
of
the
earth
they
were
of
the
best
blood
and
ranked
as
the
best
sons
of
the
whole
country
they
were
young
strong
and
energetic
men
hardy
courageous
and
adventurous
caring
little
for
the
dangers
of
the
frontier
they
extended
civilization
and
reclaimed
for
the
industry
of
the
world
vast
prairies
and
forests
and
deserts
they
made
roads
built
bridges
and
mills
cleared
the
forests
broke
the
prairies
erected
houses
and
barns
and
defended
the
settled
country
against
hostile
indians
they
were
distinguished
especially
for
their
general
intelligence
their
hospitality
their
independence
and
bold
enterprise
they
had
schools
and
schoolhouses
erected
churches
and
observed
the
sabbath
a
law
abiding
people
the
pioneers
made
laws
and
obeyed
them
they
were
loyal
american
citizens
and
strongly
attached
to
the
national
government
the
pioneers
were
religious
but
not
ecclesiastical
they
lived
in
the
open
and
looked
upon
the
relations
of
man
to
nature
with
an
open
mind
to
be
sure
their
thoughts
were
more
on
getting
along
in
this
world
than
upon
the
immortal
crown
of
the
puritan
and
yet
in
the
silent
forest
in
the
broad
prairie
in
the
deep
blue
sky
in
the
sentinels
of
the
night
in
the
sunshine
and
in
the
storm
in
the
rosy
dawn
in
the
golden
sunset
and
in
the
daily
trials
and
battles
of
frontier
life
they
too
must
have
seen
and
felt
the
infinite
nor
is
it
a
matter
of
surprise
that
the
pioneers
of
iowa
possessed
the
elements
of
character
above
attributed
to
them
in
the
first
place
only
strong
and
independent
souls
ventured
to
the
frontier
a
weaker
class
could
not
have
hoped
to
endure
the
toils
the
labors
the
pains
and
withal
the
loneliness
of
pioneer
life
for
the
hardest
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
significant
battles
of
the
century
were
fought
with
axes
and
plows
in
the
winning
of
the
west
the
frontier
called
for
men
with
large
capacity
for
adaptation
men
with
flexible
and
dynamic
natures
especially
did
it
require
men
who
could
break
with
the
past
forget
traditions
and
easily
discard
inherited
political
and
social
ideas
the
key
to
the
character
of
the
pioneer
is
the
law
of
the
adaptation
of
life
to
environment
the
pioneers
of
iowa
were
what
they
were
largely
because
the
conditions
of
frontier
life
made
them
such
they
were
sincere
because
their
environment
called
for
an
honest
attitude
having
left
the
comforts
of
their
old
homes
traveled
hundreds
and
thousands
of
miles
entered
the
wilderness
and
endured
the
privations
of
the
frontier
they
were
they
came
for
a
purpose
and
therefore
were
always
doing
something
even
to
this
day
their
ideals
of
thrift
and
push
and
frugality
pervade
the
commonwealth
and
so
the
strong
external
factors
of
the
west
brought
into
american
civilization
elements
distinctively
american
liberal
ideas
and
democratic
ideals
the
broad
rich
prairies
of
iowa
and
illinois
seem
to
have
broadened
men
views
and
fertilized
their
ideas
said
stephen
douglas
i
found
my
mind
liberalized
and
my
opinions
enlarged
when
i
got
out
on
these
broad
prairies
with
only
the
heavens
to
bound
my
vision
instead
of
having
them
circumscribed
by
the
narrow
ridges
that
surrounded
the
valley
in
vermont
where
i
was
born
speaking
to
an
iowa
audience
governor
kirkwood
once
said
we
are
rearing
the
typical
americans
the
western
yankee
if
you
choose
to
call
him
so
the
man
of
grit
the
man
of
nerve
the
man
of
broad
and
liberal
views
the
man
of
tolerance
of
opinion
the
man
of
energy
the
man
who
will
some
day
dominate
this
empire
of
ours
how
prophetic
nowhere
did
the
west
exert
a
more
marked
influence
than
in
the
domain
of
politics
it
freed
men
from
traditions
it
gave
them
a
new
and
a
more
progressive
view
of
political
life
henceforth
they
turned
with
impatience
from
historical
arguments
and
legal
theories
to
a
philosophy
of
expediency
government
they
concluded
was
after
all
a
relative
affair
claim
rights
were
more
important
to
the
pioneer
of
iowa
than
states
rights
the
nation
was
endeared
to
him
and
he
freely
gave
his
first
allegiance
to
the
government
that
sold
him
land
for
an
acre
he
was
always
the
so
that
in
after
years
men
said
of
the
commonwealth
he
founded
her
affections
like
the
rivers
of
her
borders
flow
to
an
inseparable
union
but
above
all
the
frontier
was
a
great
leveler
the
conditions
of
life
there
were
such
as
to
make
men
plain
common
unpretentious
genuine
the
frontier
fostered
the
sympathetic
attitude
it
made
men
really
democratic
and
in
matters
political
led
to
the
ideal
of
equality
which
constitutes
the
essence
of
american
democracy
in
the
century
namely
equality
before
the
law
equality
in
the
law
equality
in
making
the
law
the
pioneer
of
the
west
may
not
have
originated
these
ideals
the
first
equality
before
the
law
is
claimed
emphatically
as
the
contribution
of
the
puritan
but
the
vitalizing
of
these
ideals
this
came
from
the
frontier
as
the
great
contribution
of
the
pioneer
iv
squatter
constitutions
it
may
seem
strange
to
class
the
customs
of
the
pioneers
among
the
early
laws
of
iowa
but
to
refer
to
the
resolutions
and
of
the
squatters
as
political
constitutions
is
more
than
strange
it
is
unorthodox
at
the
same
time
history
teaches
that
in
the
evolution
of
political
institutions
customs
precede
statutes
written
laws
follow
unwritten
conventions
the
legal
is
the
outgrowth
of
the
and
constitutional
government
is
developed
out
of
government
one
need
not
search
the
records
of
antiquity
nor
decipher
the
monuments
for
illustrations
of
these
truths
for
in
the
early
political
history
of
iowa
there
is
a
recurrence
of
the
process
of
institutional
evolution
including
the
stage
of
customary
law
here
in
our
own
annals
one
may
read
plainly
writ
the
origin
of
laws
and
constitutional
government
absence
of
legislative
statutes
and
administrative
ordinances
on
the
frontier
did
not
mean
anarchy
and
disorder
the
early
settlers
of
iowa
were
literally
and
in
that
good
old
sense
lawful
men
of
the
neighborhood
who
from
the
beginning
observed
the
usages
and
customs
of
the
community
well
and
truly
did
they
observe
the
customs
relative
to
the
making
and
holding
of
claims
and
as
occasion
demanded
they
codified
these
customs
and
usages
into
constitutions
resolutions
and
crude
fragmentary
and
as
were
their
codes
they
nevertheless
stand
as
the
first
written
constitutions
in
the
history
of
the
commonwealth
they
were
the
fundamental
laws
of
the
pioneers
or
better
still
they
were
squatter
constitutions
the
squatter
constitutions
of
iowa
since
they
were
a
distinctive
product
of
frontier
life
are
understood
and
their
significance
appreciated
only
when
interpreted
through
the
conditions
of
western
life
and
character
it
was
through
cession
and
purchase
that
the
united
states
came
into
possession
of
the
vast
public
domain
of
which
the
fertile
farming
fields
of
iowa
formed
a
part
title
to
the
land
vested
absolutely
in
the
government
of
the
united
states
but
the
right
of
the
indians
to
occupy
the
country
was
not
disputed
until
such
right
had
been
extinguished
by
formal
agreement
entered
into
between
the
united
states
and
the
indians
no
white
citizen
was
competent
to
make
legal
settlement
therein
as
early
as
congress
provided
that
no
settlement
should
be
made
on
any
part
of
the
public
domain
until
the
indian
title
thereto
had
been
extinguished
and
the
land
surveyed
again
in
congress
provided
that
if
any
person
or
persons
shall
after
the
passing
of
this
act
take

in

hereinafter
directed
and
also
to
take

measures
and
to
employ
such
military
force
as
he
may
judge
necessary
and
proper
to

ceded

as

any

hereafter
take

thereon
until
thereunto
authorized

and
every
right
title
or

forfeited
under
this
act
shall
be
taken
and
deemed
to
be
vested
in
the
united
states
without
any
other
or
further
proceedings
in
march
the
act
of
was
revived
with
special
reference
to
the
iowa
country
to
which
the
indian
title
was
in
accordance
with
the
treaty
of
to
be
extinguished
in
june
it
was
made
lawful
for
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
direct
the
indian
agents
at
prairie
du
chien
and
rock
island
or
either
of
them
when
offenses
against
the
said
act
shall
be
committed
on
lands
recently
acquired
by
treaty
from
the
sac
and
fox
indians
to
execute
and
perform
all
the
duties
required
by
the
said
act
to
be
performed
by
the
marshals
in
such
mode
as
to
give
full
effect
to
the
said
act
in
and
over
the
lands
acquired
as
aforesaid
thus
it
is
plain
that
the
early
settlers
of
iowa
had
no
legal
right
to
advance
beyond
the
surveyed
country
mark
off
claims
and
occupy
and
cultivate
lands
which
had
not
been
surveyed
and
to
which
the
united
states
had
not
issued
a
warrant
patent
or
certificate
of
purchase
but
the
pioneers
on
their
way
to
the
prairies
did
not
pause
to
read
the
united
states
statutes
at
large
they
outran
the
public
surveyors
they
ignored
the
act
of
and
it
is
doubtful
if
they
ever
heard
of
the
act
of
march
some
were
bold
enough
to
cross
the
mississippi
and
put
in
crops
even
before
the
indian
title
had
expired
some
squatted
on
unsurveyed
lands
and
others
late
comers
settled
on
surveyed
territory
the
government
made
some
successful
effort
to
keep
them
off
indian
soil
but
whenever
and
wherever
the
indian
title
had
been
extinguished
there
the
hardy
pioneers
of
iowa
pressed
forward
determining
for
themselves
and
in
their
own
way
the
bounds
and
limits
of
the
frontier
hundreds
and
thousands
of
claims
were
thus
located
hundreds
and
thousands
of
farms
were
thus
formed
hundreds
and
thousands
of
homesteads
were
thus
established
hundreds
and
thousands
of
improvements
were
thus
begun
hundreds
and
thousands
of
settlers
from
all
parts
of
the
union
thus
squatted
on
the
national
commons
all
without
the
least
vestige
of
legal
right
or
title
in
when
the
surveys
were
first
begun
over
of
these
squatters
had
settled
in
the
iowa
country
it
was
not
until
that
the
first
of
the
public
land
sales
were
held
at
dubuque
and
burlington
these
marginal
or
frontier
settlers
squatters
as
they
were
called
were
beyond
the
pale
of
constitutional
government
no
statute
of
congress
protected
them
in
their
rights
to
the
claims
they
had
staked
out
and
the
improvements
they
had
made
in
they
were
trespassers
in
they
were
honest
farmers
now
it
was
to
meet
the
peculiar
conditions
of
frontier
life
and
especially
to
secure
themselves
in
what
they
were
pleased
to
call
their
rights
in
making
and
holding
claims
that
the
pioneers
of
iowa
established
land
clubs
or
claim
associations
nearly
every
community
in
early
iowa
had
its
local
club
or
association
it
is
impossible
to
give
definite
figures
but
it
is
safe
to
say
that
over
one
hundred
of
these
organizations
existed
in
territorial
iowa
some
like
the
claim
club
of
fort
dodge
were
organized
and
flourished
after
the
commonwealth
had
been
admitted
into
the
union
in
the
recollections
and
reminiscences
of
pioneers
many
references
are
made
to
these
early
land
clubs
or
claim
associations
and
constitutions
or
resolutions
are
sometimes
reproduced
therewith
in
whole
or
in
part
but
and
adequate
manuscript
of
but
two
iowa
organizations
have
thus
far
come
to
light
the
constitution
and
records
of
the
claim

of
johnson
county
preserved
by
the
iowa
state
historical

by

to
the
written
document
in
addition
to
the
constitution
resolutions
were
from
time
to
time
adopted
with
the
force
of
laws
it
is
here
that
the
real
spirit
and
purpose
of
the
pioneer
squatters
is
best
expressed
with
characteristic
frankness
they
resolved
to
discountenance
any
attempts
on
the
part
of
any
and
every
person
to
intrude
in
any
way
upon
the
rightful
claims
of
another
since
the
presumption
is
that
a
person
thus
attempting
to
take
away
a
portion
of
the
hard
earnings
of
the
enterprising
and
industrious
setler
is
dishonest
no
gentlemen
that
they
insisted
upon
equity
rather
than
upon
refined
technicalities
in
the
administration
of
their
law
is
seen
in
the
following
resolved
that
to
avoid
difficulty
growing
out
of
the
circumstance
of
persons
extending
their
improvements
accidentaly
on
the
claims
of
others
before
the
lines
were
run
thereby
giving
the
first
setlr
an
opportunity
or
advantage
of
preemption
over
the
rightful
owner
that
any
person
who
hold
such
advantages
shall
immediately
relinquish
all
claim
thereto
to
the
proper
owner
and
any
one
refusing
so
to
do
shall
forfeit
all
claim
to
the
right
of
protection
of
the
association
for
the
speculator
who
sometimes
attended
the
land
sales
the
squatters
had
little
respect
so
they
resolved
that
for
the
purpose
of
garding
our
rights
against
the
speculator
we
hereby
pledge
ourselves
to
stand
by
each
other
and
to
remain
on
the
ground
until
all
sales
are
over
if
it
becomes
necessary
in
order
that
each
and
every
setler
may
be
secured
in
the
claim
or
claims
to
which
he
is
justly
entitled
by
the
laws
of
this
association
and
remarkable
as
it
may
seem
the
same
protection
which
was
pledged
before
the
sale
was
guaranteed
to
all
such
members
as
may
be
unable
to
enter
their
claims
at
the
sale
after
such
sale
and
until
the
same
may
be
entered

them

larger

necessary

a
hundred
pages
could
easily
be
devoted
to
this
interesting
phase
of
our
political
history
but
the
details
already
given
will
suffice
to
indicate
the
nature
scope
and
purpose
of
the
squatter
constitutions
of
iowa
their
influence
is
clearly
seen
in
a
fourfold
direction
first
they
made
it
possible
and
practicable
for
the
settlers
to
go
upon
the
public
domain
surveyed
or
unsurveyed
and
establish
homes
without
the
immediate
inconvenience
of
paying
for
the
land
secondly
they
secured
to
the
bona
fide
settlers
the
right
to
make
improvements
on
the
public
lands
and
to
dispose
of
the
same
for
a
reasonable
consideration
or
to
purchase
their
improved
land
from
the
government
at
the
minimum
price
of
an
acre
thirdly
they
afforded
bona
fide
settlers
adequate
protection
in
the
peaceable
possession
and
enjoyment
of
their
homes
without
fear
of
being
molested
or
ousted
either
by
the
government
or
the
newcomer
or
the
land
speculator
until
the
land
was
offered
for
sale
or
opened
for
entry
or
until
they
were
able
to
enter
or
purchase
the
same
for
themselves
and
their
families
fourthly
they
fostered
natural
justice
equality
and
democracy
on
the
frontier
by
establishing
order
under
a
government
founded
upon
the
wishes
of
the
people
and
in
harmony
with
the
peculiar
conditions
social
and
economic
of
the
community
by
giving
security
alike
to
all
bona
fide
settlers
by
limiting
the
amount
of
land
any
one
settler
could
rightfully
hold
by
requiring
all
disputes
to
be
settled
in
regularly
constituted
courts
and
by
conducting
all
public
affairs
in
and
through
mass
meetings
with
the
full
knowledge
and
consent
of
all
the
people
in
their
constitutions
and
resolutions
the
squatters
suggested
and
in
a
measure
definitely
determined
the
manner
of
disposing
of
the
public
lands
the
principles
of
the
most
important
legislation
of
congress
relative
to
the
public
domain
came
from
the
frontier
a
comparison
of
the
customs
of
the
squatters
with
the
provisions
of
the
and
homestead
acts
reveals
the
truth
that
the
latter
are
largely
compilations
of
the
former
these
american
principles
of
agrarian
polity
are
products
of
frontier
experience
one
is
even
justified
in
suggesting
that
herein
we
have
perhaps
come
across
the
origin
of
the
american
principle
of
homestead
exemptions
is
it
not
reasonable
to
suggest
that
the
emphasis
which
frontier
life
and
customs
placed
upon
the
importance
and
value
of
the
homestead
gave
birth
to
the
laws
that
are
based
upon
the
idea
that
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
for
the
promotion
of
the
property
of
the
state
and
to
render
independent
and
above
want
each
citizen
of
the
government
it
is
proper
he
should
have
a
home
a
homestead
where
his
family
may
be
sheltered
and
live
beyond
the
reach
of
financial
misfortune
the
squatter
constitutions
stand
for
the
beginnings
of
local
political
institutions
in
iowa
they
were
the
fundamental
law
of
the
first
governments
of
the
pioneers
they
were
the
fullest
embodiment
of
the
theory
of
squatter
sovereignty
they
were
indeed
fountains
of
that
spirit
of
western
democracy
which
permeated
the
social
and
political
life
of
america
during
the
century
but
above
all
they
expressed
and
in
places
and
under
conditions
where
temptations
to
recklessness
and
lawlessness
were
greatest
they
effectively
upheld
the
foremost
civilizing
principle
of
polity
the
rule
of
law
v
the
territory
of
wisconsin
the
year
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
is
memorable
in
the
constitutional
annals
of
iowa
since
it
marks
the
beginning
of
the
territorial
epoch
and
the
advent
of
our
first
general
code
or
text
of
fundamental
law
to
be
sure
the
iowa
country
had
had
a
certain
constitutional
status
ever
since
the
acquisition
of
the
province
of
louisiana
in
in
it
formed
a
part
of
the
district
of
louisiana
which
was
placed
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
governor
and
judges
of
the
territory
of
indiana
in
it
remained
a
part
of
that
district
known
henceforth
as
the
territory
of
louisiana
in
it
was
included
within
the
newly
created
territory
of
missouri
in
it
was
reserved
for
freedom
by
the
missouri
compromise
and
finally
after
being
without
a
local
constitutional
status
for
more
than
thirteen
years
it
was
attached
to
and
made
a
part
of
the
territory
of
michigan
for
the
purpose
of
temporary
government
nevertheless
it
would
be
sheer
antiquarianism
to
catalogue
the
treaty
and
conventions
of
and
the
several
acts
of
congress
establishing
the
district
of
louisiana
the
territory
of
louisiana
the
territory
of
missouri
and
the
territory
of
michigan
as
constitutions
of
iowa
furthermore
a
constitution
is
the
fundamental
law
of
a
not
of
a
and
since
the
iowa
country
was
practically
uninhabited
prior
to
the
earlier
territorial
governments
which
have
been
mentioned
had
for
iowa
only
a
nominal
political
significance
this
is
not
to
deny
that
iowa
has
a
history
prior
to
it
simply
points
out
that
this
earlier
history
is
largely
a
record
of
changes
in
subordinate
jurisdiction
over
a
geographical
area
and
in
no
sense
the
annals
of
a
political
society
even
after
the
permanent
settlement
of
the
iowa
country
in
the
early
thirties
and
its
union
with
the
territory
of
michigan
in
constitutional
government
west
of
the
mississippi
continued
to
be
more
nominal
than
real
this
is
true
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
archives
of
the
territory
of
michigan
show
that
the
governor
and
the
legislative
council
made
a
serious
attempt
to
provide
for
and
put
into
operation
local
constitutional
government
in
his
message
of
september
addressed
to
the
legislative
council
governor
mason
referred
to
the
inhabitants
as
an
intelligent
industrious
and
enterprising
people
who
being
without
the
limits
of
any
regularly
organized
government
depend
alone
upon
their
own
virtue
intelligence
and
good
sense
as
a
guaranty
of
their
mutual
and
individual
rights
and
interests
he
suggested
and
urged
the
immediate
organization
for
them
of
one
or
two
counties
with
one
or
more
townships
in
each
county
the
suggestions
of
the
governor
were
referred
to
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
and
incorporated
into
an
act
to
lay
off
and
organize
counties
west
of
the
mississippi
river
this
act
which
was
approved
september
to
go
into
effect
october
organized
the
iowa
country
to
which
the
indian
title
had
been
extinguished
in
june
into
the
counties
of
dubuque
and
demoine
it
also
provided
that
each
county
should
constitute
a
township
and
that
the
first
election
for
township
officers
should
take
place
on
the
first
monday
of
november
the
laws
operative
in
the
county
of
iowa
and
not
locally
inapplicable
were
to
have
full
force
in
the
country
west
of
the
mississippi
furthermore
the
archives
show
that
the
offices
of
the
newly
created
counties
were
duly
filled
by
the
governor
of
the
territory
of
michigan
by
and
with
the
consent
of
the
legislative
council
letters
and
petitions
addressed
to
the
governor
are
evidence
that
the
people
did
not
hesitate
to
recommend
candidates
or
ask
for
removals
in
dubuque
county
they
forced
the
resignation
of
the
chief
justice
of
the
county
court
and
secured
the
appointment
of
a
candidate
of
their
own
choice
and
when
a
vacancy
occurred
in
the
office
of
sheriff
the
inhabitants
of
the
same
county
thinking
that
the
best
method
of
recommending
a
suitable
person
for
that
office
was
to
elect
one
at
their
annual
township
meeting
voted
for
david
gillilan
as
their
choice
the
clerk
of
the
county
court
who
was
authorized
to
notify
the
governor
of
the
results
of
the
election
expressed
the
hope
that
a
commission
will
be
prepared
and
sent
as
early
as
practicable
the
records
show
that
gillilan
was
subsequently
appointed
by
the
governor
so
much
for
the
public
archives
of
the
territory
of
michigan
respecting
the
political
status
of
the
iowa
country
in
a
memorial
to
congress
drawn
up
and
adopted
by
a
delegate
convention
of
of
the
people
west
of
the
mississippi
assembled
at
burlington
in
november
this
statement
is
made
in
reference
to
the
two
years
from
to
during
the
whole
of
this
time
the
whole
country
sufficient
of
itself
for
a
respectable
state
was
included
in
the
counties
dubuque
and
demoine
in
each
of
these
two
counties
there
were
holden
during
the
said
term
of
two
years
two
terms
of
a
county
court
as
the
only
source
of
judicial
relief
up
to
the
passage
of
the
act
of
congress
creating
the
territory
of
wisconsin
the
legislative
council
of
the
michigan
territory
in
a
memorial
which
bears
the
date
of
march
went
on
record
to
this
effect
according
to
the
decision
of
our
federal
court
the
population
west
of
the
mississippi
are
not
within
its
jurisdiction
a
decision
which
is
presumed
to
be
in
accordance
with
the
delegated
power
of
the
court
and
the
acknowledged
laws
of
the
land
but
that
ten
or
twelve
thousand
citizens
of
the
united
states
living
in
its
territory
should
be
unprotected
in
their
lives
and
property
by
its
courts
of
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
is
an
anomaly
unparalleled
in
the
annals
of
republican
legislation
the
immediate
attention
of
congress
to
this
subject
is
of
vital
importance
to
the
people
west
of
the
mississippi
on
the
floor
of
congress
patton
of
virginia
adverted
to
the
peculiar
situation
of
the
inhabitants
of
that
territory
the
territory
which
was
soon
afterwards
organized
as
wisconsin
they
being
without
government
and
without
laws
this
was
in
april
on
the
same
day
george
jones
the
delegate
from
michigan
declared
that
the
people
of
western
wisconsin
are
now
and
have
ever
been
without
the
pale
of
judicial
tribunals
he
stated
that
he
did
not
know
of
a
single
set
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
within
the
bounds
of
the
contemplated
territory
the
position
of
the
iowa
country
for
several
months
immediately
preceding
the
organization
of
the
territory
of
wisconsin
was
indeed
peculiar
in
the
eastern
part
of
what
had
been
the
territory
of
michigan
the
people
had
framed
and
adopted
a
state
constitution
as
early
as
october
they
elected
state
officers
but
on
account
of
a
dispute
with
ohio
over
boundary
lines
congress
was
in
no
hurry
to
recognize
the
new
state
then
for
a
time
there
were
two
governments
the
government
of
the
state
of
michigan
and
the
government
of
the
territory
of
michigan
each
claiming
to
be
the
only
rightful
and
legitimate
authority
it
was
not
until
january
that
the
existence
of
michigan
as
a
state
was
recognized
at
washington
lieutenant
albert
lea
a
united
states
army
officer
who
had
spent
some
time
in
the
country
west
of
the
mississippi
did
not
fail
to
observe
the
anomalous
condition
of
the
people
writing
early
in
he
said
it
is
a
matter
of
some
doubt
in
fact
whether
there
be
any
law
at
all
among
these
people
but
this
question
will
soon
be
put
to
rest
by
the
organization
of
the
territory
of
wisconsin
within
which
the
iowa
district
is
by
law
included
but
a
general
conclusion
concerning
the
actual
political
status
of
the
iowa
country
prior
to
the
organization
of
the
territory
of
wisconsin
is
no
longer
doubtful
when
to
these
documentary
evidences
are
added
the
sweeping
testimony
of
the
early
squatters
who
declare
that
the
only
government
and
laws
they
knew
or
cared
anything
about
in
those
days
were
the
organization
and
rules
of
the
claim
club
it
is
substantially
correct
to
say
that
the
territorial
epoch
in
our
history
dates
from
the
fourth
day
of
july
when
wisconsin
was
constituted
a
separate
territory
for
the
purposes
of
temporary
government
and
that
our
first
code
or
text
of
fundamental
law
that
is
to
say
the
first
constitution
of
iowa
was
an
act
establishing
the
territorial
government
of
wisconsin
as
regards
this
conclusion
two
criticisms
are
anticipated
first
it
will
be
said
that
since
the
territory
of
iowa
was
organized
in
the
territorial
epoch
in
our
history
could
not
have
begun
in
secondly
it
will
be
said
that
an
act
of
congress
providing
for
and
establishing
a
territory
is
not
a
constitution
the
answer
to
the
first
criticism
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
iowa
country
was
not
an
outlying
district
attached
to
the
territory
of
wisconsin
but
really
formed
a
constituent
part
thereof
the
area
of
wisconsin
territory
west
of
the
mississippi
was
far
more
extensive
than
the
area
of
the
same
territory
east
of
the
river
in
population
the
two
areas
were
nearly
equal
but
the
west
tended
to
increase
more
rapidly
than
the
east
the
importance
of
the
west
is
further
evidenced
by
the
removal
of
the
capital
after
the
first
session
of
the
legislative
assembly
from
belmont
in
eastern
wisconsin
to
burlington
in
western
wisconsin
the
constitutional
history
of
wisconsin
up
to
the
division
of
the
territory
in
is
therefore
clearly
a
part
of
the
territorial
history
of
iowa
the
assignment
of
the
old
name
wisconsin
to
the
country
east
of
the
mississippi
and
of
the
new
name
iowa
to
the
country
west
of
that
river
in
when
the
territory
of
wisconsin
was
divided
did
give
to
territorial
government
among
our
people
the
act
of
congress
of
june
provided
for
the
division
of
an
existing
territory
and
the
of
territorial
government
in
the
western
part
thereof
under
the
name
iowa
when
however
all
this
is
conceded
the
propriety
of
referring
to
the
organic
act
of
a
territory
as
a
constitution
is
questioned
it
is
true
that
the
act
establishing
the
territorial
government
of
wisconsin
was
not
drawn
up
by
the
people
of
the
territory
it
was
not
even
submitted
to
them
for
ratification
handed
down
to
them
by
congress
in
the
form
of
an
ordinary
statute
it
was
a
pure
product
of
legislation
it
did
not
even
have
the
label
constitution
or
fundamental
compact
or
organic
law
nevertheless
this
instrument
was
a
veritable
constitution
since
it
was
a
written
body
of
fundamental
law
in
accordance
with
which
the
government
of
the
territory
was
instituted
and
administered
it
was
supreme
serving
as
the
absolute
rule
of
action
for
all
departments
and
officers
of
the
territorial
government
the
courts
always
took
this
view
of
the
organic
act
and
refused
to
enforce
acts
which
were
clearly
in
opposition
to
its
provisions
vi
the
territory
of
iowa
in
the
year
there
was
printed
and
published
at
philadelphia
a
small
book
bearing
on
its
these
words
notes
on
wisconsin
territory
with
a
map
by
lieutenant
albert
lea
united
states
dragoons
philadelphia
henry
tanner
shakespear
building
the
significance
of
this
little
volume
lies
in
the
fact
that
through
it
the
country
destined
to
give
birth
to
the
only
free
child
of
the
missouri
compromise
was
christened
iowa
lieutenant
lea
was
familiar
with
the
country
described
in
his
notes
he
had
traveled
through
it
had
seen
its
beautiful
prairies
had
met
its
inhabitants
face
to
face
and
had
enjoyed
their
frontier
hospitality
he
must
have
been
deeply
impressed
by
the
iowa
river
and
its
name
referring
to
the
country
west
of
the
mississippi
river
he
says
the
district
under
review
has
been
often
called
purchase
and
it
is
sometimes
called
the
purchase
but
from
the
extent
and
beauty
of
the
iowa
river
which
runs
centrally
through
the
district
and
gives
character
to
most
of
it
the
name
of
that
stream
being
both
euphonous
and
appropriate
has
been
given
to
the
district
itself
the
iowa
district
was
likely
to
become
a
separate
territory
at
an
early
day
since
all
indications
pointed
in
the
direction
of
a
division
of
the
territory
of
wisconsin
first
the
geographical
area
of
the
territory
as
designated
in
the
organic
act
was
sufficient
for
three
or
four
ordinary
commonwealths
secondly
this
area
did
not
possess
geographical
unity
thirdly
historical
traditions
and
considerations
favored
the
establishment
of
a
separate
territory
east
of
the
mississippi
which
at
the
proper
time
should
be
admitted
as
the
fifth
state
born
of
the
ordinance
of
within
the
limits
of
the
old
territory
of
the
northwest
fourthly
the
population
of
the
territory
which
was
increasing
with
unparalleled
rapidity
was
so
widely
scattered
as
to
make
it
practically
impossible
to
give
equal
force
to
the
laws
and
equal
efficiency
to
the
administration
of
government
in
all
of
the
frontier
communities
that
the
father
of
waters
should
serve
as
the
natural
line
of
division
was
generally
conceded
scarcely
had
the
act
organizing
the
territory
of
wisconsin
gone
into
effect
when
the
agitation
for
division
was
launched
by
the
fall
of
it
had
captured
the
public
mind
the
burden
of
the
movement
was
taken
up
with
enthusiasm
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
iowa
district
they
realized
that
the
proposition
to
remove
the
seat
of
the
territorial
government
from
burlington
to
some
point
east
of
the
mississippi
was
likely
to
rob
them
of
much
political
influence
and
some
distinction
they
felt
that
a
territorial
government
located
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
the
four
lakes
could
not
successfully
administer
constitutional
government
in
the
iowa
district
the
people
of
des
moines
county
were
among
the
first
to
take
formal
action
on
what
may
well
be
called
the
first
vital
question
in
the
history
of
the
constitutions
of
iowa
at
a
meeting
held
in
the
town
of
burlington
on
saturday
september
they
resolved
that
while
we
have
the
utmost
confidence
in
the
ability
integrity
and
patriotism
of
those
who
control
the
destinies
of
our
present
territorial
government
and
of
our
delegate
in
the
congress
of
the
u
states
we
do
nevertheless
look
to
a
division
of
the
territory
and
the
organization
of
a
separate
territorial
government
by
congress
west
of
the
mississippi
river
as
the
only
means
of
immediately
and
fully
securing
to
the
citizens
thereof
the
benefits
and
immunities
of
a
government
of
laws
in
another
resolution
they
respectfully
and
earnestly
recommend
to
the
people
of
the
territory
west
of
the
mississippi
river
immediately
to
hold
county
meetings
in
their
respective
counties
and
appoint
three
delegates
from
each
county
to
meet
in
convention
at
this
place
on
the
first
monday
in
november
next
pursuant
to
this
call
of
the
people
of
the
county
of
des
moines
for
an
iowa
district
convention
delegates
from
seven
organized
counties
west
of
the
mississippi
met
at
the
capitol
in
burlington
on
monday
november
and
organized
themselves
into
a
territorial
convention
as
such
they
continued
in
session
for
three
successive
days
on
the
second
day
a
resolution
was
adopted
inviting
the
governor
members
of
the
legislative
council
judges
and
members
of
the
bar
of
burlington
to
take
seats
within
the
bar
committees
were
then
appointed
to
prepare
memorials
on
the
several
subjects
before
the
delegates
for
consideration
on
the
third
day
three
separate
memorials
to
congress
were
unanimously
adopted
these
related
to
the
northern
boundary
line
of
missouri
and
the
division
of
the
territory
in
the
memorial
relative
to
the
proposed
division
of
the
territory
it
was
represented
that
the
citizens
of
that
part
of
the
territory
west
of
the
mississippi
river
taking
into
consideration
their
remote
and
isolated
position
and
the
vast
extent
of
country
included
within
the
limits
of
the
present
territory
and
the
utter
impracticability
of
the
same
being
governed
as
an
entire
whole
by
the
wisest
and
best
administration
of
our
municipal
affairs
in
such
manner
as
to
fully
secure
individual
right
and
the
rights
of
property
as
well
as
to
maintain
domestic
tranquillity
and
the
good
order
of
society
have
by
their
respective
representatives
convened
in
general
convention
as
aforesaid
for
the
purpose
of
availing
themselves
of
their
right
of
petition
as
free
citizens
by
representing
their
situation
and
wishes
to
your
honorable
body
and
asking
for
the
organization
of
a
separate
territorial
government
over
that
part
of
the
territory
west
of
the
mississippi
river
without
in
the
least
designing
to
question
the
official
conduct
of
those
in
whose
hands
the
fate
of
our
infant
territory
has
been
confided
and
in
whose
patriotism
and
wisdom
we
have
the
utmost
confidence
your
memorialists
can
not
refrain
from
the
frank
expression
of
their
belief
that
taking
into
consideration
the
geographical
extent
of
her
country
in
connection
with
the
probable
population
of
western
wisconsin
perhaps
no
territory
of
the
united
states
has
been
so
much
neglected
by
the
parent
government
so
illy
protected
in
the
political
and
individual
rights
of
her
citizens
it
will
appear
that
we
have
existed
as
a
portion
of
an
organized
territory
for
sixteen
months
with
but
one
term
of
court
your
memorialists
look
upon
those
evils
as
growing
exclusively
out
of
the
immense
extent
of
country
included
within
the
present
boundaries
of
the
territory
and
express
their
conviction
and
belief
that
nothing
would
so
effectually
remedy
the
evil
as
the
organization
of
western
wisconsin
into
a
separate
territorial
government
to
this
your
memorialists
conceive
themselves
entitled
by
principles
of
moral
right
by
the
sacred
obligation
that
rests
upon
the
present
government
to
protect
them
in
the
free
enjoyment
of
their
rights
until
such
time
as
they
shall
be
permitted
to
provide
protection
for
themselves
as
well
as
from
the
uniform
practice
and
policy
of
the
government
in
relation
to
her
other
territories
your
memorialists
therefore
pray
for
the
organization
of
a
separate
territorial
government
over
that
part
of
the
territory
of
wisconsin
west
of
the
mississippi
river
the
time
and
place
of
the
meeting
of
this
remarkable
territorial
convention
were
certainly
most
opportune
meeting
in
the
halls
of
the
legislative
assembly
at
the
capital
of
the
territory
and
in
the
very
presence
of
the
members
of
the
assembly
the
delegates
declared
it
to
be
the
wish
and
will
of
the
people
that
the
territory
be
divided
the
members
of
the
assembly
were
impressed
with
the
fact
that
the
people
west
of
the
mississippi
were
in
earnest
and
as
representatives
of
the
whole
territory
they
too
drew
up
a
memorial
which
was
approved
by
the
governor
within
three
weeks
after
the
convention
had
adjourned
in
this
memorial
the
legislative
assembly
stated
the
case
as
follows
that
owing
to
the
great
extent
of
country
embraced
in
the
limits
of
wisconsin
territory
and
that
vast
extent
of
territory
being
separated
by
a
natural
division
the
mississippi
river
which
renders
the
application
of
the
same
laws
oppressive
or
unequal
to
one
section
or
the
other
the
true
policy
of
the
two
sections
of
the
territory
being
as
widely
different
as
their
locations
and
the
impracticability
of
the
officers
of
the
general
government
to
administer
the
laws
render
it
highly
important
in
the
opinion
of
your
memorialists
that
that
portion
of
the
territory
lying
west
of
the
mississippi
river
be
formed
into
a
separate
territorial
government
the
territory
of
wisconsin
now
contains
fifty
thousand
inhabitants
of
which
at
least
reside
on
the
west
side
of
the
mississippi
river
without
any
intention
of
censuring
the
official
conduct
of
the
officers
in
whose
hands
the
administration
of
our
infant
territory
has
been
intrusted
your
memorialists
would
respectfully
represent
that
the
western
portion
of
wisconsin
with
a
population
of
thousand
souls
reaps
but
a
small
portion
of
the
benefits
and
advantages
of
the
fostering
care
and
protection
of
the
mother
government
your
memorialists
would
further
represent
that
the
population
of
wisconsin
is
increasing
with
a
rapidity
unparalleled
in
the
history
of
the
settlement
of
our
country
that
by
a
division
of
the
territory
and
the
formation
of
a
separate
territorial
government
west
of
the
mississippi
river
your
honorable
body
would
greatly
advance
the
political
and
individual
interests
of
her
citizens
by
january
the
people
had
expressed
their
views
they
had
formulated
their
convictions
into
a
definite
request
which
called
for
immediate
division
of
the
territory
the
scene
of
debate
and
discussion
now
shifts
from
the
prairies
to
the
halls
of
congress
here
on
february
the
committee
on
the
territories
to
whom
had
been
referred
the
memorials
of
the
territorial
convention
and
legislative
assembly
along
with
petitions
from
sundry
citizens
and
who
by
a
resolution
of
december
had
been
instructed
to
inquire
into
the
expediency
of
establishing
a
separate
territorial
government
for
that
section
of
the
present
territory
of
wisconsin
which
lies
west
of
the
mississippi
river
and
north
of
the
state
of
missouri
reported
a
bill
to
divide
the
territory
of
wisconsin
and
establish
the
territorial
government
of
iowa
in
the
report
which
accompanied
this
bill
the
committee
stated
that
they
had
become
satisfied
that
the
present
territory
of
wisconsin
is
altogether
too
large
and
unwieldy
for
the
perfect
and
prompt
administration
of
justice
or
for
the
convenient
administration
of
the
civil
government
thereof
they
were
more
specific
in
saying
that
the
judges
of
the
territory
as
it
now
is
and
also
the
governor
district
attorney
and
marshal
are
entirely
unable
to
perform
their
respective
duties
in
all
parts
of
the
territory
they
also
pointed
out
that
of
the
fifty
thousand
inhabitants
in
the
territory
more
than
half
resided
west
of
the
mississippi
river
that
the
population
was
rapidly
increasing
that
the
natural
line
of
division
was
the
mississippi
river
that
the
capital
would
soon
be
removed
to
eastern
wisconsin
and
that
so
much
of
the
territory
of
wisconsin
as
is
east
of
the
mississippi
river
must
necessarily
form
one
state
it
was
not
however
until
early
in
the
month
of
june
that
an
act
to
divide
the
territory
of
wisconsin
and
to
establish
the
territorial
government
of
iowa
passed
both
the
senate
and
the
house
of
representatives
on
june
it
received
the
approval
of
president
van
buren
as
the
constitution
of
the
territory
of
iowa
it
took
effect
on
the
anniversary
of
the
independence
of
the
american
nation
in
the
chronology
of
our
constitutions
it
stands
as
the
second
code
or
text
of
fundamental
law
but
the
territory
of
iowa
was
not
established
without
opposition
in
congress
the
discussion
in
the
house
of
representatives
on
the
fifth
and
sixth
days
of
june
and
immediately
preceding
the
passage
of
the
act
dividing
the
territory
of
wisconsin
brought
out
something
of
the
broader
significance
of
the
proposition
to
create
a
new
territory
in
the
country
west
of
the
mississippi
and
north
of
the
state
of
missouri
from
the
records
it
appears
that
the
sympathies
of
the
representatives
were
not
all
with
the
men
on
the
frontier
mason
of
ohio
who
moved
to
strike
out
the
enacting
clause
said
that
he
desired
to
obtain
information
relative
to
the
assertion
that
the
people
had
settled
there
in
a
manner
contrary
to
law
waddy
thompson
opposed
the
bill
and
the
creation
of
a
territorial
government
in
the
northwest
he
went
at
great
length
into
a
consideration
of
the
balance
of
power
between
the
northern
and
western
and
southern
states
as
far
as
related
to
the
questions
of
slavery
and
the
annexation
of
texas
he
declared
that
he
would
never
consent
to
the
coming
in
of
these
territories
or
states
into
the
union
when
the
fanatical
spirit
of
the
north
was
pouring
into
the
house
memorials
against
the
annexation
of
texas
simply
because
it
was
cursed
with
the
peculiar
institution
of
the
south
to
preserve
the
balance
of
power
between
the
two
sections
of
the
union
was
the
substance
of
thompson
plea
if
by
the
creation
of
the
territory
of
iowa
the
north
is
promised
a
new
state
the
demand
of
the
south
for
the
annexation
of
texas
should
in
accordance
with
the
principle
of
the
balance
of
power
be
recognized
thus
it
was
proposed
to
meet
the
problem
of
admitting
states
at
the
time
of
the
formation
of
new
territories
in
the
course
of
the
debate
it
was
suggested
by
mercer
that
iowa
be
organized
as
a
territory
when
wisconsin
was
admitted
as
a
state
it
remained
for
shepard
of
north
carolina
to
make
emphatic
objections
all
along
the
line
he
opened
his
speech
by
intimating
that
the
bill
had
been
introduced
to
the
end
that
a
fresh
rich
field
might
be
opened
to
those
who
speculate
in
public
lands
and
a
batch
of
new
offices
created
for
such
as
seek
executive
favor
he
had
no
sympathy
with
the
squatters
who
are
these
that
pray
for
the
establishment
of
a
new
territory
individuals
who
have
left
their
own
homes
and
seized
on
the
public
land
these
men
pounced
on
the
choicest
spots
cut
down
the
timber
built
houses
and
cultivated
the
soil
as
if
it
were
their
own
property
without
the
authority
of
law
and
in
defiance
of
the
government
they
have
taken
possession
of
what
belongs
to
the
whole
nation
and
appropriated
to
a
private
use
that
which
was
intended
for
the
public
welfare
these
are
they
who
require
a
governor
and
council
judges
and
marshals
when
every
act
of
their
lives
is
contrary
to
justice
and
every
petition
which
they
make
is
an
evidence
of
their
guilt
and
violence
we
who
are
insulted
whose
authority
is
trampled
under
foot
are
asked
for
new
favors
and
privileges
the
guardians
of
the
law
are
approached
by
its
open
contemners
and
begged
to
erect
these
modest
gentlemen
into
a
dignified
government
i
can
not
sanction
their
conduct
if
they
would
not
move
peaceably
they
should
go
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
if
they
forget
what
is
due
to
their
country
and
their
distant
they
ought
to
be
punished
the
majesty
of
the
laws
should
be
vindicated
the
representative
from
north
carolina
was
jealous
of
the
growth
and
development
of
the
west
and
he
objected
to
the
liberal
land
policy
of
the
united
states
since
it
encouraged
the
young
men
to
leave
their
southern
homes
he
declared
that
if
the
territory
of
iowa
be
now
established
it
will
soon
become
a
state
and
if
we
now
cross
the
mississippi
under
the
beautiful
patronage
of
this
government
the
cupidity
and
enterprise
of
our
people
will
carry
the
system
still
further
and
ere
long
the
rocky
mountains
will
be
scaled
and
the
valley
of
the
columbia
be
embraced
in
our
domain
this
then
is
the
time
to
pause
if
happiness
depended
entirely
on
the
number
of
hogs
raised
or
the
quantity
of
corn
gathered
then
the
citizens
should
be
dispersed
so
as
to
occupy
the
most
fertile
spots
in
our
whole
territory
but
whatever
may
be
the
effect
of
this
land
policy
on
the
general
welfare
it
has
been
deeply
injurious
to
the
southern
portion
of
the
confederacy
if
all
of
the
people
born
in
north
carolina
had
remained
in
its
limits
our
swamps
and
low
grounds
would
have
rivalled
the
valley
of
the
nile
in
production
and
our
pine
barrens
would
have
been
flourishing
with
the
vine
the
olive
and
the
mulberry
we
have
therefore
reason
to
complain
of
the
policy
of
this
government
others
may
act
as
pleases
them
but
i
will
never
sustain
a
policy
so
detrimental
to
the
people
with
whom
i
am
connected
if
these
remarks
be
unavailing
the
patriot
should
fear
for
the
permanence
of
the
republic
the
spirited
debate
which
took
place
in
the
house
of
representatives
on
the
question
of
the
establishment
of
the
territorial
government
of
iowa
disclosed
the
fact
that
the
creation
of
a
new
territory
at
this
time
west
of
the
mississippi
and
north
of
missouri
was
of
more
than
local
interest
it
was
indeed
an
event
in
the
larger
history
of
america
some
few
men
were
beginning
to
realize
that
the
rapid
settlement
of
the
iowa
country
was
not
an
isolated
provincial
episode
but
the
surface
manifestation
of
a
current
that
was
of
national
depth
statesmen
whose
eyes
were
neither
blinded
by
the
lights
of
the
moment
nor
yet
always
riveted
upon
that
which
for
the
time
was
most
brilliant
saw
that
a
plain
pioneer
farmer
from
across
the
mississippi
had
come
upon
the
stage
of
national
politics
and
had
already
begun
to
play
a
role
in
the
great
drama
of
american
democracy
but
even
the
prophets
did
not
so
much
as
dream
that
within
the
memory
of
men
then
living
the
awkward
amateur
would
take
the
part
of
a
leading
actor
in
the
play
vii
the
constitution
of
the
territory
the
territorial
epoch
in
our
history
began
in
when
the
territory
of
wisconsin
was
established
it
came
to
a
close
in
when
the
state
of
iowa
was
organized
and
admitted
into
the
union
two
constitutions
belong
to
this
decade
the
organic
act
of
the
territory
of
wisconsin
and
the
organic
act
of
the
territory
of
iowa
these
constitutions
are
very
much
alike
both
in
form
and
content
indeed
the
latter
was
copied
from
or
modeled
upon
the
former
an
outline
of
either
would
fairly
indicate
the
content
of
the
fundamental
law
for
the
whole
territorial
epoch
but
to
avoid
unnecessary
repetition
on
the
one
hand
and
confusion
on
the
other
the
title
of
the
present
chapter
will
be
taken
to
mean
the
organic
act
of
the
constitution
of
the
territory
of
iowa
is
clearly
an
outgrowth
of
american
political
development
in
its
provisions
is
summed
up
the
final
product
of
that
most
interesting
series
of
evolutionistic
transformations
in
territorial
government
that
took
place
throughout
the
north
and
west
the
first
in
the
long
line
of
american
territorial
constitutions
and
the
starting
point
of
subsequent
development
was
the
ordinance
of
the
congress
of
the
confederation
now
familiarly
known
as
the
ordinance
of
nor
was
this
famous
ordinance
itself
a
code
of
political
principles
consciously
or
unconsciously
its
framers
drew
largely
from
the
principles
forms
and
practices
of
american
government
prior
to
the
revolution
the
analogy
between
the
colonial
and
territorial
governments
of
america
is
too
striking
to
be
dismissed
as
accidental
the
relation
of
the
united
states
to
the
territories
has
always
been
of
a
colonial
character
in
the
history
of
territorial
government
the
ordinance
of
stands
as
the
magna
charta
of
the
west
but
the
great
ordinance
like
the
great
charter
was
in
many
respects
crude
incomplete
and
place
it
by
the
side
of
the
constitution
of
the
territory
of
iowa
and
it
is
plain
to
see
that
in
the
course
of
fifty
years
marked
changes
had
taken
place
especially
in
the
direction
of
democratization
the
constitution
of
the
territory
is
a
written
instrument
of
twenty
sections
or
articles
containing
in
all
about
four
thousand
words
it
has
no
preamble
but
is
simply
introduced
by
the
enacting
clause
as
a
pure
product
of
congressional
legislation
it
was
promulgated
upon
the
legislative
authority
of
congress
with
the
approval
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
its
origin
therefore
it
resembles
the
royal
charters
of
europe
more
than
the
written
constitutions
of
america
the
constitution
of
the
territory
was
literally
handed
down
to
the
people
who
were
governed
under
its
provisions
their
own
directly
given
the
first
section
purports
to
create
a
new
territory
by
fixing
the
boundaries
thereof
and
declaring
that
from
and
after
the
third
day
of
july
next
all
power
and
authority
of
the
government
of
wisconsin
in
and
over
the
territory
hereby
constituted
shall
cease
on
reading
this
section
one
is
almost
startled
by
the
way
in
which
a
body
of
legislators
to
have
made
a
constitution
and
established
a
new
political
society
in
providing
for
the
executive
department
in
the
very
next
section
the
logical
order
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
reversed
by
placing
the
executive
power
and
authority
before
that
of
the
legislative
this
however
was
altogether
natural
since
the
governor
had
been
the
central
figure
in
territorial
government
ever
since
the
days
of
the
great
clair
he
was
no
but
the
real
government
influencing
legislation
as
well
as
directing
the
administration
robert
lucas
the
first
of
the
territorial
governors
of
iowa
seems
to
have
fully
apprehended
this
fact
for
from
the
very
outset
he
made
himself
the
real
power
in
public
affairs
the
influence
of
the
governor
was
dominant
in
territorial
government
chiefly
because
like
his
prototype
in
the
colonies
he
represented
the
majesty
and
the
supreme
authority
of
the
national
government
the
executive
power
and
authority
in
and
over
the
said
territory
of
iowa
runs
the
organic
act
shall
be
vested
in
a
governor
who
shall
hold
his
office
for
three
years
unless
sooner
removed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
governor
was
appointed
by
the
president
but
must
reside
in
the
territory
and
shall
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed
he
was
of
the
militia
and
commissioned
all
officers
appointed
under
the
laws
of
the
territory
it
was
his
to
grant
pardons
for
offenses
against
the
laws
of
the
territory
and
provisional
reprieves
for
offenses
against
the
laws
of
the
united
states
besides
all
this
he
was
superintendent
of
indian
affairs
for
the
national
government
in
the
government
of
the
territory
of
iowa
the
governor
was
something
more
than
chief
of
the
militia
and
author
of
commissions
and
pardons
like
the
king
of
england
he
was
a
constituent
branch
of
the
body
not
only
did
the
organic
act
declare
that
the
legislative
power
shall
be
vested
in
the
governor
and
a
legislative
assembly
but
it
gave
to
the
governor
the
power
of
an
absolute
veto
over
all
acts
of
the
assembly
indeed
it
was
this
extraordinary
power
to
participate
in
legislation
along
with
the
power
to
appoint
all
inferior
judicial
officers
justices
of
the
peace
sheriffs
militia
officers
and
county
surveyors
that
gave
our
first
governor
a
real
power
and
prestige
not
since
enjoyed
by
any
executive
state
or
territorial
a
secretary
of
the
territory
was
provided
for
in
the
third
section
this
officer
stood
next
to
the
governor
in
importance
and
in
case
of
the
death
removal
resignation
or
necessary
absence
from
the
territory
of
the
latter
he
was
authorized
and
required
to
execute
and
perform
the
gubernatorial
powers
and
duties
the
secretary
was
appointed
by
the
president
for
a
term
of
four
years
but
was
subject
to
removal
at
any
time
his
chief
duty
was
to
record
and
preserve
the
laws
acts
and
proceedings
of
both
the
legislative
assembly
and
the
governor
and
yearly
transmit
copies
thereof
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
to
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
legislative
power
was
by
the
fourth
section
of
the
constitution
vested
in
the
governor
and
a
legislative
assembly
the
assembly
was
a
representative
body
organized
on
the
bicameral
plan
into
a
council
and
a
house
of
representatives
the
council
consisted
of
thirteen
members
elected
biennially
while
the
house
of
representatives
had
just
double
that
number
elected
annually
the
members
of
both
houses
were
chosen
directly
by
the
qualified
voters
of
the
territory
they
were
elected
by
districts
and
apportioned
on
the
basis
of
population
the
assembly
was
to
meet
annually
but
no
session
in
any
year
shall
exceed
the
term
of
days
a
lavish
delegation
of
power
was
granted
to
the
legislative
assembly
by
the
sixth
section
of
the
constitution
which
provided
that
the
legislative
power
of
the
territory
shall
extend
to
all
rightful
subjects
of
legislation
just
what
is
meant
by
rightful
subjects
of
legislation
is
nowhere
stated
but
from
the
pages
of
the
territorial
statutes
it
is
manifest
that
the
important
subjects
of
legislation
were
in
general
the
establishment
of
local
government
the
creation
of
business
and
public
corporations
the
maintenance
of
the
institution
of
private
property
the
fulfilment
of
contracts
and
the
guarantee
of
personal
security
the
sphere
of
legislation
granted
to
the
territory
was
larger
than
that
reserved
to
the
commonwealth
of
iowa
it
would
however
be
a
grave
mistake
to
view
the
powers
of
the
legislative
assembly
as
unlimited
since
the
constitution
of
the
territory
contains
certain
specific
prohibitions
a
general
limitation
and
a
bill
of
rights
the
specific
prohibitions
are
no
law
shall
be
passed
interfering
with
the
primary
disposal
of
the
soil
no
tax
shall
be
imposed
upon
the
property
of
the
united
states
nor
shall
the
lands
or
other
property
of
be
taxed
higher
than
the
lands
or
other
property
of
residents
these
specific
prohibitions
are
followed
in
the
same
section
by
the
general
limitation
which
reads
all
the
laws
of
the
governor
and
legislative
assembly
shall
be
submitted
to
and
if
disapproved
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
the
same
shall
be
null
and
of
no
effect
the
territorial
bill
of
rights
as
set
forth
in
the
constitution
is
exceedingly
brief
perhaps
the
shortest
bill
of
rights
on
record
it
consists
of
a
single
sentence
and
reads
as
follows
the
inhabitants
of
the
said
territory
shall
be
entitled
to
all
the
rights
privileges
and
immunities
heretofore
granted
and
secured
to
the
territory
of
wisconsin
and
to
its
inhabitants
on
its
face
this
guarantee
of
the
fundamental
rights
of
man
and
of
the
citizen
seems
vague
and
unsatisfactory
but
it
is
nevertheless
large
in
implication
if
we
turn
to
the
constitution
of
the
territory
of
wisconsin
to
see
what
rights
privileges
and
immunities
were
therein
guaranteed
we
find
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
said
territory
shall
be
entitled
to
and
enjoy
all
and
singular
the
rights
privileges
and
advantages
granted
and
secured
to
the
people
of
the
territory
of
the
united
states
northwest
of
the
river
ohio
by
the
articles
of
the
compact
contained
in
the
ordinance
for
the
government
of
the
said
territory
passed
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
july
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
and
shall
be
subject
to
all
the
conditions
and
restrictions
and
prohibitions
in
said
articles
of
compact
imposed
upon
the
people
of
the
said
territory
in
other
words
the
provisions
of
the
ordinance
of
are
by
implication
made
a
part
of
the
constitution
of
the
territory
of
iowa
thus
the
people
of
iowa
inherited
through
the
territorial
constitutions
of
and
the
political
principles
of
the
great
ordinance
of
as
a
bill
of
rights
great
was
the
legacy
mark
the
classical
expression
of
that
instrument
in
enumerating
the
immemorial
rights
privileges
and
principles
of
polity
no
person
demeaning
himself
in
a
peaceable
and
orderly
manner
shall
ever
be
molested
on
account
of
his
mode
of
worship
or
religious
sentiments
the
inhabitants
of
the
said
territory
shall
always
be
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
writ
of
and
of
the
trial
by
jury
of
a
proportionate
representation
of
the
people
in
the
legislature
and
of
judicial
proceedings
according
to
the
course
of
the
common
law
all
persons
shall
be
bailable
unless
for
capital
offences
where
the
proof
shall
be
evident
or
the
presumption
great
all
fines
shall
be
moderate
and
no
cruel
or
unusual
punishments
shall
be
inflicted
no
man
shall
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
or
property
but
by
the
judgment
of
his
peers
or
the
law
of
the
land
and
should
the
public
exigencies
make
it
necessary
for
the
common
preservation
to
take
any
person
property
or
to
demand
his
particular
services
full
compensation
shall
be
made
for
the
same
and
in
the
just
preservation
of
rights
and
property
it
is
understood
and
declared
that
no
law
ought
ever
to
be
made
or
have
force
in
the
said
territory
that
shall
in
any
manner
whatever
interfere
with
or
affect
private
contracts
or
engagements
and
without
fraud
previously
formed
these
words
are
more
than
formal
expressions
of
great
principles
they
are
ennobling
but
to
read
farther
that
religion
morality
and
knowledge
are
necessary
to
good
government
and
the
happiness
of
mankind
and
that
there
shall
be
neither
slavery
nor
involuntary
servitude
in
the
said
territory
is
to
inspire
reverence
such
indeed
are
the
liberties
we
prize
and
the
rights
we
will
maintain
the
judicial
power
of
the
territory
was
vested
by
the
constitution
in
a
supreme
court
district
courts
probate
courts
and
in
justices
of
the
peace
the
supreme
court
consisted
of
a
chief
justice
and
two
associate
justices
they
were
appointed
by
the
president
for
a
period
of
four
years
and
were
required
to
hold
a
term
of
court
annually
at
the
seat
of
government
the
constitution
further
directed
that
the
territory
be
divided
into
three
judicial
districts
that
a
district
court
or
courts
be
held
in
each
of
the
three
districts
by
one
of
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
and
that
the
said
judges
reside
in
the
districts
respectively
assigned
to
them
the
courts
of
the
territory
of
iowa
were
legislative
courts
that
is
courts
created
by
congressional
legislation
the
extent
of
their
jurisdiction
was
much
greater
than
that
of
state
courts
since
by
the
organic
act
they
were
empowered
to
exercise
the
customary
jurisdiction
of
both
state
and
federal
courts
in
addition
to
those
already
mentioned
the
constitution
provided
for
two
other
prominent
territorial
officers
namely
a
marshal
and
an
attorney
both
were
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
for
a
term
of
four
years
at
the
national
capital
the
territory
was
represented
by
a
delegate
who
was
elected
by
the
people
for
a
term
of
two
years
the
delegate
was
entitled
to
a
seat
in
the
house
of
representatives
where
he
could
participate
in
debate
but
was
not
allowed
a
vote
one
of
the
most
significant
sections
of
the
constitution
is
the
fifth
it
provides
that
every
free
white
male
citizen
of
the
united
states
above
the
age
of
years
who
shall
have
been
an
inhabitant
of
said
territory
at
the
time
of
its
organization
shall
be
entitled
to
vote
at
the
first
election
and
shall
be
eligible
to
any
office
within
the
said
territory
thereafter
the
suffrage
qualifications
were
to
be
determined
by
the
legislative
assembly
that
the
right
of
suffrage
shall
be
exercised
only
by
citizens
of
the
united
states
although
the
organic
act
of
was
almost
a
literal
copy
of
the
organic
act
of
the
following
differences
are
worthy
of
observation
first
the
term
of
the
members
of
the
council
was
changed
from
four
years
in
to
two
years
in
secondly
the
term
of
representatives
was
changed
from
two
years
in
to
one
year
in
thirdly
the
term
of
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
was
changed
from
good
behavior
in
to
four
years
in
fourthly
by
the
organic
act
of
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
were
required
to
reside
in
their
respective
districts
fifthly
the
salary
of
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
was
reduced
from
eighteen
hundred
dollars
in
to
fifteen
hundred
dollars
in
reflection
upon
the
history
and
provisions
of
the
constitution
of
the
territory
leads
to
a
few
general
conclusions
first
this
constitution
was
written
codified
in
the
second
place
it
was
an
act
of
congress
again
its
provisions
represent
political
evolution
in
territorial
government
up
to
the
year
furthermore
government
in
the
territory
though
subordinate
had
a
wider
sphere
of
activity
under
the
organic
act
than
has
ever
since
been
enjoyed
by
government
under
a
state
constitution
this
is
true
since
the
legislative
assembly
and
the
territorial
courts
exercised
to
a
considerable
extent
the
customary
functions
of
both
national
and
state
governments
still
further
the
president
of
the
united
states
was
in
theory
the
head
of
territorial
administration
since
he
had
the
power
to
appoint
and
remove
the
chief
administrative
officers
in
the
territory
finally
there
existed
in
the
machinery
of
territorial
government
a
nice
balance
between
administration
on
the
one
hand
and
legislation
on
the
other
that
is
between
the
part
which
was
responsible
directly
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
the
part
which
was
responsible
directly
to
the
people
of
the
territory
viii
the
constitution
of
the
territory
amended
no
provision
for
its
amendment
is
contained
in
the
organic
act
of
but
by
inference
and
implication
it
is
clear
that
the
power
to
change
alter
or
amend
the
constitution
of
the
territory
resided
in
congress
the
process
of
amendment
therefore
was
that
of
ordinary
legislation
congress
was
not
long
in
exercising
this
extraordinary
power
on
march
within
eight
months
of
the
organization
of
the
territory
the
president
approved
two
acts
amending
the
constitution
these
were
an
act
to
alter
and
amend
the
organic
law
of
the
territories
of
wisconsin
and
iowa
and
an
act
to
authorize
the
election
or
appointment
of
certain
officers
in
the
territory
of
iowa
and
for
other
purposes
the
first
limited
the
veto
power
of
the
governor
by
providing
that
bills
not
approved
by
him
might
nevertheless
become
laws
if
passed
a
second
time
by
of
both
houses
of
the
legislative
assembly
the
second
likewise
aimed
at
curtailing
the
powers
of
the
governor
by
authorizing
the
legislative
assembly
to
provide
by
law
for
the
election
or
appointment
of
sheriffs
judges
of
probate
justices
of
the
peace
and
county
surveyors
the
history
of
a
quarrel
between
the
governor
and
the
first
legislative
assembly
which
in
a
great
measure
occasioned
these
amendments
is
significant
in
throwing
light
upon
the
political
ideas
and
the
democratic
frankness
and
determination
of
the
people
of
the
territory
on
july
president
van
buren
issued
a
commission
to
robert
lucas
of
ohio
appointing
him
governor
of
the
new
territory
of
iowa
the
position
was
a
difficult
one
to
fill
but
the
president
selection
promised
to
be
the
very
best
lucas
was
neither
young
obscure
nor
inexperienced
born
in
virginia
he
had
served
with
distinction
in
the
war
of
he
had
served
in
the
legislature
of
ohio
and
had
twice
been
elected
to
the
office
of
governor
by
the
people
of
that
state
in
he
acted
as
chairman
of
the
first
national
convention
of
the
democratic
party
upon
receiving
his
commission
as
governor
of
iowa
robert
lucas
repaired
with
all
possible
haste
to
the
west
venerable
with
years
and
political
experience
he
arrived
at
burlington
in
august
here
he
found
that
wm
conway
the
secretary
of
the
territory
had
the
executive
prerogative
had
issued
a
proclamation
dividing
the
territory
into
judicial
districts
and
was
about
issuing
a
proclamation
apportioning
the
representatives
and
ordering
an
election
the
conduct
of
the
secretary
provoked
the
governor
and
robert
lucas
was
not
the
man
to
conceal
his
feelings
or
hesitate
to
express
his
mind
from
that
time
to
the
death
of
the
secretary
in
november
the
two
men
were
enemies
lucas
in
a
letter
to
john
forsyth
secretary
of
state
declared
that
conway
has
not
only
done
nothing
to
render
me
assistance
but
generally
believed
to
be
the
prime
mover
of
the
opposition
to
my
proceedings
and
the
of
the
documents
forwarded
to
washington
by
the
members
of
the
legislature
the
first
legislative
assembly
of
the
territory
of
iowa
did
not
meet
until
november
on
the
first
day
of
the
session
each
house
proceeded
to
organize
then
they
assembled
jointly
in
the
hall
of
the
house
of
representatives
to
be
sworn
in
by
the
governor
and
to
receive
any
communication
which
his
excellency
might
have
to
make
to
them
governor
lucas
delivered
his
first
message
in
person
he
took
pains
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
the
organic
act
had
vested
the
legislative
power
in
the
governor
and
a
legislative
assembly
which
meant
that
the
executive
is
vested
with
advisory
and
restraining
powers
and
the
legislative
assembly
with
deliberative
and
enacting
powers
in
no
place
he
declared
later
in
a
communication
to
the
secretary
of
the
territory
is
there
any
power
vested
in
the
legislative
assembly
independent
of
the
governor
throughout
the
message
which
when
printed
covered
ten
pages
of
the
journal
the
governor
freely
advised
and
recommended
such
measures
as
he
deemed
most
expedient
then
near
the
close
he
boldly
added
i
shall
at
all
times
take
pleasure
in
concurring
with
you
in
acts
that
tend
to
advance
the
general
interests
of
the
territory
and
the
prosperity
of
the
people
but
at
the
same
time
will
be
compelled
to
withhold
my
assent
to
such
acts
or
proceedings
as
i
may
conscientiously
for
the
time
being
believe
to
be
prejudicial
to
the
public
good
robert
lucas
lived
up
to
the
spirit
and
the
letter
of
his
declaration
in
the
matter
of
appointments
the
governor
policy
was
courageously
set
forth
in
these
words
i
shall
at
all
times
pay
a
due
respect
to
recommendations
but
can
not
conscientiously
nominate
to
office
any
individual
of
moral
or
that
may
be
addicted
to
or
if
known
to
me
these
vices
are
so
contaminating
in
their
character
that
all
public
officers
in
my
opinion
should
be
clear
of
even
a
suspicion
of
being
addicted
to
them
lucas
writing
some
years
later
was
of
the
opinion
that
this
declaration
was
one
of
the
potent
causes
of
opposition
to
his
administration
after
the
election
of
permanent
officers
which
followed
the
governor
speech
the
legislative
assembly
proceeded
with
energy
and
enthusiasm
to
the
business
of
legislation
but
not
a
few
of
its
measures
met
with
the
disapproval
of
the
governor
it
soon
became
evident
that
the
relations
between
the
executive
and
the
assembly
were
not
altogether
cordial
the
situation
was
made
still
more
embarrassing
by
the
ill
feeling
which
existed
between
the
governor
and
the
secretary
of
the
territory
indeed
it
is
clear
that
conway
was
instrumental
in
stirring
up
much
of
the
opposition
to
governor
lucas
by
confiding
his
private
grievances
to
members
of
the
assembly
by
deferring
to
the
assembly
to
the
point
of
servility
and
by
affecting
to
set
up
an
administrative
department
distinct
and
separate
from
that
of
the
governor
on
november
he
submitted
to
the
council
and
house
of
representatives
the
first
of
a
series
of
communications
bearing
directly
upon
his
own
position
and
powers
as
secretary
and
his
relations
to
the
legislative
assembly
and
indirectly
upon
his
relations
to
the
governor
and
the
relations
of
the
latter
to
the
assembly
it
was
early
in
the
session
that
the
council
and
house
of
representatives
resolved
that
when
an
act
is
presented
to
the
governor
for
his
approval
he
shall
within
a
reasonable
time
thereafter
make
known
to
the
house
in
which
said
act
may
have
originated
of
his
approval
thereof
or
if
not
approved
of
the
act
shall
be
returned
with
his
objections
thereto
for
some
weeks
after
its
passage
this
resolution
seems
to
have
received
no
attention
either
there
was
delay
in
presenting
it
to
the
governor
or
the
governor
did
not
give
it
his
immediate
attention
it
was
not
until
january
that
the
resolution
was
returned
to
the
house
of
representatives
with
this
observation
from
the
governor
i
see
no
place
in
the
organic
law
that
vests
the
council
and
house
of
representatives
with
the
right
to
dictate
to
the
executive
in
the
discharge
of
his
official
duties
in
the
meantime
the
council
had
taken
steps
looking
toward
the
regulation
by
statute
of
all
official
intercourse
between
the
legislative
and
executive
departments
of
the
government
on
december
a
committee
of
two
was
appointed
to
confer
with
the
governor
and
report
a
bill
the
committee
held
the
conference
and
reported
a
bill
on
the
day
following
after
some
discussion
the
bill
passed
the
council
on
december
but
not
without
important
amendments
on
the
day
following
the
bill
as
amended
passed
the
house
of
representatives
it
was
presented
to
the
governor
on
the
on
december
lucas
returned
the
bill
to
the
council
with
his
veto
he
objected
to
the
changes
which
had
been
made
in
the
bill
as
originally
reported
by
the
committee
at
the
same
time
he
took
occasion
to
state
for
the
information
of
the
assembly
the
course
he
intended
to
pursue
in
the
future
he
said
all
bills
resolutions
or
memorials
submitted
to
me
will
be
carefully
examined
and
if
approved
will
be
signed
and
deposited
in
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
the
territory
if
special
objections
are
found
but
not
sufficient
to
induce
me
to
withhold
my
assent
from
the
bill
resolution
or
memorial
a
special
note
of
explanation
will
be
endorsed
with
my
approval
bills
resolutions
or
memorials
that
may
be
considered
entirely
objectionable
or
of
doubtful
policy
will
be
under
or
returned
to
the
legislative
assembly
with
my
objections
at
such
time
and
in
such
way
and
manner
as
i
may
for
the
time
being
deem
to
be
most
advisable
in
reply
to
all
this
it
was
resolved
by
the
council
and
house
of
representatives
of
the
territory
of
iowa
that
his
excellency
gov
lucas
is
hereby
respectfully
requested
to
inform
each
house
of
the
legislative
assembly
of
all
acts
by
him
approved
during
the
present
session
and
that
he
is
further
requested
hereafter
to
inform
the
house
in
which
a
bill
originated
of
his
approval
thereof
immediately
after
the
same
has
been
given
with
a
brief
message
lucas
returned
this
resolution
to
the
house
of
representatives
on
january
he
would
at
all
times
be
pleased
to
comply
with
requests
from
the
assembly
provided
it
could
be
done
with
some
propriety
and
conscience
but
having
neither
secretary
clerk
messenger
assistant
or
other
attendant
in
public
employ
at
the
executive
office
i
must
respectfully
decline
a
compliance
with
your
respectful
request
and
most
respectfully
invite
your
attention
to
my
communication
of
the
december
last
two
days
later
a
committee
of
the
house
of
representatives
headed
by
james
grimes
reported
on
the
governor
vetoes
they
held
that
the
various
executive
vetoes
were
not
only
uncalled
for
but
were
unwarranted
by
the
organic
act
of
the
territory
the
phrase
in
the
constitution
which
reads
shall
approve
of
all
laws
is
mandatory
and
leaves
the
executive
without
discretion
the
committee
took
the
whole
matter
very
seriously
believing
that
great
principles
were
at
stake
as
representatives
of
the
people
they
declared
we
conceive
that
we
should
be
recreant
to
their
rights
and
true
interests
if
we
should
acquiesce
in
the
power
as
used
by
the
executive
we
believe
the
people
should
be
heard
through
those
who
represent
them
and
are
responsible
to
them
that
their
wishes
should
be
regarded
and
not
the
wishes
of
the
federal
government
or
a
federal
officer
we
believe
the
principle
claimed
by
the
governor
is
a
most
dangerous
and
pernicious
principle
and
as
the
representatives
of
freemen
we
can
not
acquiesce
in
it
a
week
later
the
house
resolved
that
robert
lucas
is
unfit
to
be
the
ruler
of
a
free
people
and
appointed
a
select
committee
to
prepare
a
memorial
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
praying
for
his
immediate
removal
the
council
committee
on
territorial
affairs
was
no
less
emphatic
in
its
condemnation
of
the
executive
vetoes
they
did
not
believe
that
congress
in
framing
the
organic
act
intended
to
confer
the
power
of
an
absolute
veto
upon
the
governor
in
their
report
of
january
upon
the
bill
regulating
the
intercourse
between
the
executive
and
legislative
departments
they
exclaimed
it
is
time
to
remonstrate
the
liberty
of
the
people
should
be
dear
to
their
representatives
and
he
who
dares
not
defend
their
sacred
rights
who
would
not
in
the
hour
of
peril
stand
as
a
sentinel
to
guard
their
privileges
is
unworthy
the
name
of
a
freeman
in
the
meantime
the
legislative
assembly
had
prepared
a
memorial
to
congress
requesting
an
amendment
to
the
organic
act
which
would
limit
the
governor
veto
power
the
governor
remained
firm
and
unmoved
to
the
end
of
the
session
notwithstanding
all
the
resolutions
reports
and
memorials
of
the
assembly
he
continued
to
approve
some
measures
veto
others
and
endorse
still
others
with
special
notes
of
explanation
nor
did
the
indignation
of
the
members
of
the
legislative
assembly
subside
as
the
session
neared
its
close
they
now
hoped
to
get
rid
of
the
governor
so
they
addressed
a
memorial
to
his
excellency
martin
van
buren
president
of
the
united
states
in
which
they
enumerated
at
length
the
faults
of
governor
lucas
administration
and
asked
for
his
immediate
removal
from
the
office
of
chief
executive
in
the
house
of
representatives
the
minority
offered
a
preamble
and
resolution
praying
that
they
be
allowed
to
forward
a
counter
memorial
to
the
president
but
on
the
motion
of
james
grimes
their
preamble
and
resolution
were
rejected
this
remarkable
memorial
concerning
robert
lucas
reads
much
like
the
arraignment
of
king
george
iii
in
the
declaration
of
independence
in
the
political
history
of
iowa
it
stands
as
the
declaration
of
the
independence
of
the
will
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
as
over
against
the
will
of
the
administration
it
stands
as
the
protest
of
democracy
against
the
exercise
of
arbitrary
power
its
significance
lies
not
in
any
statement
or
misstatement
of
historical
facts
but
in
the
spirit
of
independence
courage
and
democracy
which
pervades
its
lines
when
the
legislative
assembly
met
in
november
the
storm
had
passed
the
constitution
of
the
territory
had
been
amended
robert
lucas
was
still
in
office
but
reflecting
upon
the
situation
he
could
truthfully
say
in
his
message
it
is
with
heartfelt
gratitude
to
almighty
god
that
i
am
through
his
permitted
again
to
address
the
legislative
assembly
ix
agitation
for
a
state
constitution
the
early
agitation
for
the
establishment
of
a
state
government
can
not
justly
be
interpreted
as
opposition
to
the
constitution
of
the
territory
or
as
disaffection
with
the
territorial
government
on
the
contrary
it
was
altogether
natural
for
the
people
who
settled
in
the
new
territory
west
of
the
mississippi
to
look
forward
to
the
early
establishment
of
a
state
government
never
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
had
territories
been
viewed
as
permanent
in
fact
it
was
everywhere
understood
that
the
territorial
organization
was
at
most
a
temporary
arrangement
which
in
time
would
give
way
to
the
more
perfect
constitution
of
the
commonwealth
then
too
in
the
case
of
iowa
there
was
such
a
rapid
growth
of
population
that
admission
into
the
union
could
not
be
long
delayed
under
any
circumstance
shepard
was
right
when
in
he
said
if
the
territory
of
iowa
be
now
established
it
will
soon
become
a
state
the
movement
for
the
establishment
of
a
state
government
was
inaugurated
by
robert
lucas
in
his
message
to
the
second
legislative
assembly
which
met
at
burlington
on
november
the
governor
was
of
the
opinion
that
in
view
of
the
rapidly
increasing
population
and
advancing
prosperity
of
the
territory
the
assembly
might
with
propriety
proceed
to
measures
preparatory
to
the
formation
of
a
constitution
and
state
government
he
knew
that
some
would
object
to
such
measures
as
premature
inasmuch
as
our
expenses
are
defrayed
by
the
united
states
while
the
financial
burdens
of
a
state
government
would
all
have
to
be
borne
by
the
people
but
argued
the
governor
did
not
prosperity
and
improvement
within
the
states
of
ohio
indiana
illinois
and
michigan
languish
during
the
territorial
period
and
then
advance
with
rapid
strides
from
the
moment
of
their
several
admissions
into
the
union
as
independent
states
to
his
excellency
these
historical
facts
were
conclusive
the
inference
was
clear
in
his
mind
prosperity
and
improvement
result
from
the
establishment
of
state
government
so
he
earnestly
recommended
to
the
legislative
assembly
the
early
passage
of
a
memorial
to
congress
respectfully
asking
of
that
body
the
passage
of
an
act
at
their
ensuing
session
granting
to
the
inhabitants
of
iowa
territory
the
right
to
form
a
constitution
and
state
government
and
to
provide
for
their
admission
into
the
union
upon
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states
furthermore
he
recommended
the
passage
of
a
law
to
provide
for
the
calling
of
a
convention
to
form
a
state
constitution
so
soon
as
congress
may
grant
by
law
the
privilege
to
do
so
the
governor
was
seriously
in
earnest
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
recommend
definite
boundaries
for
the
proposed
commonwealth
lucas
was
not
alone
in
these
advanced
views
the
newly
elected
president
of
the
council
stephen
hempstead
thought
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
territory
is
yet
in
the
bloom
of
infancy
only
a
short
period
will
elapse
before
iowa
will
become
a
state
you
gentlemen
he
said
addressing
the
members
of
the
council
are
placed
here
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
her
rights
as
a
territory
to
enact
salutary
laws
for
her
government
and
to
prepare
her
for
an
admission
into
the
union
under
the
great
principles
of
civil
liberty
but
the
legislative
assembly
was
more
conservative
at
the
regular
session
of
it
neither
memorialized
congress
on
admission
into
the
union
nor
passed
a
law
providing
for
the
calling
of
a
convention
to
form
a
constitution
in
opposition
to
the
recommendations
of
the
governor
and
the
views
of
a
minority
in
the
assembly
it
was
argued
that
the
establishment
of
state
government
would
increase
the
burdens
of
taxation
which
must
render
the
new
state
government
burdensome
as
well
as
odious
to
the
people
that
it
could
not
add
to
the
prosperity
of
the
agriculturalist
the
merchant
the
miner
or
the
mechanic
nor
could
it
render
any
more
fruitful
the
sources
of
profit
which
are
open
to
honest
industry
and
application
and
that
the
people
of
the
territory
enjoy
under
the
acts
of
congress
ample
liberty
and
freedom
in
the
second
legislative
assembly
of
the
territory
was
not
willing
to
assume
the
responsibility
of
measures
looking
toward
so
radical
a
change
in
the
political
status
of
the
people
of
iowa
on
january
it
adjourned
only
to
meet
again
in
extra
session
later
in
the
year
in
the
meantime
the
committee
on
territories
in
the
house
of
representatives
had
reported
a
bill
enabling
the
people
of
iowa
to
form
a
constitution
and
state
government
this
gave
lucas
an
opportunity
of
directing
attention
again
to
the
matter
in
which
he
was
so
deeply
interested
when
the
assembly
met
in
extra
session
july
he
was
prepared
with
a
suggestion
that
was
as
reasonable
as
it
was
democratic
he
would
have
the
whole
question
referred
to
the
people
for
decision
presuming
that
the
bill
before
congress
would
pass
lucas
ventured
to
suggest
to
the
legislative
assembly
the
expediency
of
providing
by
law
for
taking
the
sense
of
the
people
of
this
territory
on
the
subject
of
a
convention
at
the
next
ensuing
annual
election
it
appears
to
me
he
said
that
there
can
be
no
objection
to
submitting
the
subject
to
the
people
for
their
consideration
as
an
expression
of
public
opinion
through
the
would
enable
the
ensuing
legislative
assembly
to
act
understandingly
and
in
accordance
with
the
expressed
will
of
the
people
on
this
important
subject
following
the
suggestion
of
the
chief
executive
the
assembly
provided
by
law
for
obtaining
the
wishes
of
the
people
at
the
annual
august
elections
all
who
favored
the
calling
of
a
convention
were
required
to
write
convention
on
their
ballots
while
all
who
opposed
the
proposition
were
required
to
write
no
convention
the
law
having
been
approved
by
the
governor
on
the
last
day
of
july
very
little
time
was
left
for
its
consideration
by
the
electorate
before
the
elections
when
the
official
returns
were
counted
the
governor
in
a
proclamation
declared
the
result
to
be
votes
for
and
votes
against
a
convention
the
defeat
which
was
decisive
indicated
that
the
squatters
had
not
yet
paid
for
their
claims
and
so
the
organic
act
of
continued
to
serve
the
people
of
iowa
as
the
code
of
fundamental
law
robert
lucas
was
disappointed
but
he
had
to
admit
that
the
territory
went
on
increasing
in
population
and
wealth
with
phenomenal
rapidity
notwithstanding
the
facts
in
the
history
of
the
old
northwest
not
even
the
imperfect
conditions
of
territorial
government
seemed
to
affect
in
the
slightest
degree
the
economic
prosperity
and
improvement
of
this
frontier
community
the
overwhelming
defeat
of
the
convention
proposition
at
the
polls
checked
for
a
time
all
agitation
in
favor
of
a
state
constitution
even
the
governor
who
up
to
this
time
had
been
its
most
sanguine
advocate
declared
in
his
message
of
november
that
since
the
people
had
expressed
their
preference
for
territorial
government
all
further
legislation
on
the
subject
at
the
present
session
is
precluded
the
question
now
remained
in
for
over
a
year
that
is
from
august
to
december
in
the
meantime
robert
lucas
had
served
out
his
full
term
of
three
years
there
was
no
chance
for
his
reappointment
since
the
democrats
had
lost
the
presidency
in
the
elections
of
the
new
whig
president
william
henry
harrison
appointed
john
chambers
of
kentucky
to
succeed
the
ohio
statesman
again
iowa
was
fortunate
in
securing
as
governor
a
man
of
experience
and
of
national
reputation
when
governor
chambers
sent
his
first
message
to
the
legislative
assembly
in
december
he
thought
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
if
the
question
of
a
convention
were
again
submitted
to
the
people
there
would
be
evidenced
by
them
a
marked
change
in
sentiment
why
the
answer
was
clearly
set
forth
in
the
message
first
the
population
of
the
territory
had
increased
phenomenally
since
august
secondly
congress
had
passed
the
distribution
act
which
provided
that
iowa
should
participate
in
the
distribution
along
with
the
states
and
three
territories
and
the
district
of
columbia
of
the
net
proceeds
of
the
sales
of
public
lands
and
that
five
hundred
thousand
acres
of
land
for
internal
improvements
should
be
granted
to
every
new
state
that
should
be
admitted
into
the
union
john
chambers
thought
the
liberal
provisions
of
the
distribution
act
would
remove
the
grounds
of
all
objections
based
upon
the
argument
that
state
organization
would
be
followed
by
burdensome
taxes
in
the
light
of
these
considerations
he
recommended
that
the
question
of
a
convention
be
again
submitted
to
the
people
following
this
recommendation
the
third
legislative
assembly
passed
an
act
to
provide
for
the
expression
of
the
opinion
of
the
people
of
the
territory
of
iowa
upon
the
subject
of
the
formation
of
a
state
constitution
and
government
and
to
enable
them
to
form
a
constitution
for
the
state
of
iowa
which
act
was
approved
february
its
provisions
were
as
elaborate
as
its
title
a
poll
was
to
be
opened
at
each
electoral
precinct
at
the
time
of
the
general
election
in
august
as
the
qualified
electors
approached
the
polls
they
were
to
be
asked
by
the
judges
of
election
whether
they
were
in
favor
of
or
against
a
convention
thereupon
the
electors
were
to
answer
simply
convention
or
no
convention
the
clerks
of
election
were
charged
with
keeping
a
record
of
these
votes
the
act
provided
further
that
should
a
majority
of
the
votes
polled
be
found
to
favor
a
convention
then
delegates
to
such
a
constitutional
convention
were
to
be
elected
on
the
second
tuesday
in
october
next
after
the
election
aforesaid
on
the
first
monday
of
november
next
following
their
election
the
delegates
elected
were
to
meet
at
iowa
city
and
proceed
to
form
a
constitution
and
state
government
for
the
territory
of
iowa
finally
it
was
provided
that
when
a
constitution
and
form
of
state
government
shall
have
been
adopted
by
the
convention
the
same
shall
be
published
in
the
newspapers
of
the
territory
and
voted
upon
by
the
people
at
the
next
general
election
which
would
be
held
in
august
the
governor
message
and
the
measure
inspired
by
it
were
clear
full
and
to
the
point
they
called
up
for
public
consideration
the
whole
problem
of
state
organization
in
its
several
phases
of
the
calling
of
a
constitutional
convention
the
formation
of
a
state
constitution
and
the
admission
of
the
state
into
the
union
they
opened
up
a
lively
political
discussion
which
was
to
continue
for
full
five
years
as
to
the
propriety
and
wisdom
of
calling
a
constitutional
convention
there
was
from
the
beginning
a
decided
difference
of
opinion
the
act
of
february
had
met
with
strong
opposition
in
both
houses
of
the
legislative
assembly
in
the
press
and
among
the
people
of
the
territory
the
question
became
naturally
enough
the
local
issue
in
party
politics
the
democrats
who
had
fathered
the
measure
in
the
assembly
were
everywhere
heartily
in
favor
of
state
organization
but
the
whigs
who
being
in
the
minority
would
neither
control
the
convention
nor
officer
the
new
state
government
were
vigorous
in
their
opposition
three
days
after
the
approval
of
the
act
of
the
assembly
there
appeared
in
the
city
a
remarkable
letter
its
author
was
francis
springer
a
member
of
the
council
and
a
whig
of
considerable
influence
his
letter
was
in
substance
a
speech
prepared
by
him
to
be
delivered
in
the
council
on
the
bill
relating
to
the
convention
but
not
delivered
because
shut
down
by
the
majority
from
this
speech
it
appears
that
the
bill
relative
to
state
organization
as
originally
introduced
provided
for
a
vote
of
the
people
on
the
question
of
a
constitutional
convention
and
the
election
of
delegates
at
the
same
time
this
was
confusing
since
the
election
of
delegates
assumed
a
favorable
vote
on
the
question
of
a
convention
but
springer
was
opposed
to
the
bill
in
any
form
he
thought
that
since
the
people
had
not
expressed
a
contrary
opinion
their
adverse
vote
in
ought
to
settle
the
question
he
intimated
that
the
bill
sought
to
create
places
for
disappointed
politicians
certain
prominent
democrats
notably
robert
lucas
and
judge
williams
had
recently
lost
their
positions
so
offices
must
be
created
for
them
hence
the
proposition
to
create
a
state
government
furthermore
springer
opposed
the
bill
because
state
organization
would
greatly
increase
the
burdens
of
local
taxation
nor
was
the
recent
legislation
of
congress
a
satisfactory
reply
for
in
his
opinion
the
benefits
to
be
derived
from
the
distribution
act
would
after
all
be
inconsiderable
satisfied
with
existing
conditions
he
asked
are
we
slaves
is
our
liberty
restricted
are
we
deprived
of
the
rights
immunities
and
privileges
of
american
citizens
is
the
rod
of
oppression
held
over
us
by
the
general
government
has
that
government
manifested
its
care
towards
us
by
sending
persons
to
out
our
liberties
misrepresent
our
character
prey
upon
us
and
eat
out
our
substance
it
is
not
pretended
that
there
is
a
murmur
of
the
kind
we
are
in
possession
of
the
most
enlarged
liberty
and
the
most
liberal
favors
then
why
urge
this
measure
uncalled
for
by
the
people
unwarranted
by
the
condition
of
the
territory
the
newspapers
of
the
territory
were
divided
on
party
lines
the
democratic
press
favored
the
calling
of
a
convention
and
urged
the
immediate
organization
of
a
state
government
while
the
whig
press
just
as
vigorously
opposed
all
such
measures
from
the
calling
of
a
convention
to
admission
into
the
union
in
favor
of
a
constitutional
convention
it
was
urged
that
the
admission
of
iowa
into
the
union
would
result
in
a
more
rapid
increase
in
the
population
by
immigration
since
immigrants
as
a
rule
preferred
states
to
territories
again
admission
into
the
union
would
give
iowa
more
influence
at
washington
which
would
probably
mean
generous
appropriations
by
congress
for
the
improvement
of
the
rapids
of
the
mississippi
politically
the
change
would
place
the
new
commonwealth
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
other
states
give
the
people
a
voice
in
the
election
of
a
president
in
and
secure
to
them
the
long
desired
privilege
of
choosing
their
own
governor
it
was
even
claimed
that
statehood
would
promote
character
foster
independence
engender
state
pride
and
inspire
dignity
since
it
would
secure
to
us
the
noblest
privilege
of
freemen
that
of
electing
our
own
officers
to
govern
over
us
instead
of
being
subjected
to
the
additional
humiliation
of
having
them
sent
from
abroad
for
that
purpose
finally
it
was
suggested
that
if
iowa
did
not
hasten
to
make
application
for
admission
into
the
union
florida
the
slave
territory
which
was
then
ready
to
be
admitted
would
be
paired
with
wisconsin
these
arguments
were
frequently
accompanied
by
declamation
and
exhortation
the
territorial
state
was
declared
to
be
a
condition
of
colonial
dependence
or
colonial
vassalage
and
so
the
question
before
the
people
was
set
forth
as
one
of
dependence
or
independence
will
they
support
the
proposition
to
establish
a
state
government
and
thus
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
the
fathers
of
the
revolution
or
will
they
oppose
the
proposition
and
thereby
brand
themselves
as
tories
to
the
advocates
of
state
government
the
way
was
clear
the
freemen
of
iowa
should
rise
and
strike
for
independence
on
the
other
hand
the
opponents
of
state
organization
were
quite
willing
to
let
good
enough
alone
they
were
satisfied
with
territorial
government
and
saw
no
good
reasons
for
a
change
they
were
not
unmindful
of
the
fact
that
under
the
existing
arrangement
the
expenses
of
the
territorial
government
were
paid
out
of
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
then
too
the
whigs
thought
that
the
whole
movement
in
favor
of
a
state
government
savored
of
jobs
and
party
aggrandizement
it
is
evident
they
said
that
a
scheme
is
maturing
with
the
of
this
territory
to
involve
the
people
in
the
support
of
a
state
government
for
the
express
purpose
as
we
believe
of
benefitting
such
men
as
lucas
lord
pomposity
and
judge
williams
and
a
few
others
of
the
same
stamp
furthermore
some
declared
that
iowa
was
too
young
for
statehood
her
resources
were
too
limited
and
the
people
were
hardly
prepared
for
the
adoption
of
state
government
lowe
argued
that
the
change
would
be
undesirable
because
there
really
were
no
eminent
men
in
the
territory
fitted
for
the
tasks
of
state
government
this
was
intimating
that
the
pioneers
of
iowa
were
incapable
of
but
the
vital
argument
against
this
or
any
measure
looking
toward
the
establishment
of
a
state
government
was
the
one
which
appealed
directly
to
the
people
as
taxpayers
under
the
organic
act
of
the
united
states
generously
assumed
the
burden
of
supporting
the
general
government
of
the
territory
and
so
the
salaries
of
governor
judges
secretary
attorney
and
marshals
the
allowance
of
the
members
of
the
legislative
assembly
the
expense
of
printing
the
laws
the
contingent
expenses
of
the
territory
and
other
incidental
expenses
were
all
paid
out
of
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
public
buildings
were
erected
out
of
funds
drawn
from
the
same
source
but
a
change
from
territorial
to
state
organization
meant
that
in
the
future
these
public
expenditures
would
have
to
be
met
by
warrants
drawn
on
the
treasury
of
the
state
the
coffers
of
which
must
be
supplied
through
local
taxation
the
people
protested
the
men
who
were
industriously
breaking
the
prairies
clearing
the
forests
and
raising
corn
preferred
to
invest
their
small
earnings
in
lands
and
plows
and
live
stock
an
attempt
was
made
to
answer
this
argument
it
was
confidently
asserted
that
the
additional
expense
entailed
by
a
state
government
would
not
exceed
thirty
thousand
dollars
annually
nor
would
this
amount
have
to
be
contributed
by
the
people
of
iowa
since
it
was
estimated
that
the
benefits
to
be
derived
from
the
distribution
act
would
more
than
meet
all
additional
obligations
besides
the
state
would
receive
five
hundred
thousand
acres
of
land
as
a
gift
while
all
the
lands
reserved
for
the
support
of
schools
could
under
state
organization
be
used
for
such
purposes
the
answer
was
of
little
avail
no
one
could
predict
with
certainty
the
operation
of
the
distribution
act
under
the
circumstances
a
majority
of
the
voters
were
not
willing
to
abandon
the
territorial
organization
for
the
dignity
of
a
commonwealth
government
at
the
general
elections
in
august
every
county
in
the
territory
returned
a
majority
a
convention
again
the
existence
of
the
organic
act
of
as
a
code
of
fundamental
law
was
prolonged
by
a
vote
of
the
people
again
the
agitation
for
a
state
constitution
remained
in
abeyance
for
over
a
year
that
is
from
august
to
december
in
the
meantime
there
were
at
least
some
immigrants
who
did
not
prefer
states
to
territories
by
may
the
population
of
the
territory
numbered
over
thousand
souls
when
the
legislative
assembly
met
in
december
governor
chambers
was
confident
that
the
population
of
iowa
had
attained
a
numerical
strength
which
entitled
the
people
to
a
participation
in
the
government
of
the
union
and
to
the
full
benefits
of
local
legislation
and
local
he
therefore
recommended
in
his
message
that
provision
be
made
for
ascertaining
the
wishes
of
the
people
in
relation
to
this
important
matter
at
the
same
time
he
advised
the
assembly
to
apply
to
congress
to
fix
and
establish
during
its
present
session
a
boundary
for
the
proposed
state
and
to
sanction
the
calling
of
a
convention
and
to
make
provision
for
our
reception
into
the
union
as
soon
as
we
shall
be
prepared
to
demand
it
the
governor
reference
at
this
time
to
a
possible
boundary
dispute
is
interesting
in
the
light
of
subsequent
events
he
says
the
establishment
of
a
boundary
for
us
by
congress
will
prevent
the
intervention
of
any
difficulty
or
delay
in
our
admission
into
the
union
which
might
result
from
our
assuming
limits
which
that
body
might
not
be
disposed
to
concede
to
us
the
legislative
assembly
responded
promptly
to
the
suggestion
that
the
people
of
the
territory
be
given
another
opportunity
to
express
an
opinion
on
what
had
come
to
be
the
most
interesting
question
in
local
politics
as
early
as
february
an
act
to
provide
for
the
expression
of
the
opinion
of
the
people
of
the
territory
of
iowa
upon
the
subject
of
the
formation
of
a
state
constitution
for
the
state
of
iowa
was
approved
by
the
governor
in
substance
this
act
was
practically
a
restatement
of
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
february
the
vote
was
to
be
taken
at
the
township
elections
in
april
in
many
respects
the
campaign
of
the
spring
of
was
a
repetition
of
the
campaign
of
on
the
main
issue
the
political
parties
were
divided
as
before
that
is
the
democrats
favored
and
the
whigs
opposed
the
calling
of
a
convention
in
the
public
speeches
and
in
the
utterances
of
the
press
there
was
little
that
was
new
or
refreshing
all
the
old
arguments
of
and
were
dragged
out
and
again
paraded
through
the
editorial
columns
of
the
newspapers
again
the
opponents
of
state
organization
talked
about
the
certain
increase
in
the
burdens
of
taxation
and
intimated
that
the
whole
movement
was
set
on
foot
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
provide
places
for
democratic
again
the
ardent
supporters
of
state
government
ignored
the
latter
charge
and
replied
to
the
taxation
argument
by
quoting
the
provisions
of
the
distribution
act
altogether
the
discussion
lacked
freshness
force
and
vigor
it
was
stale
and
hackneyed
two
years
of
growth
and
reflection
had
wrought
a
change
in
sentiment
the
public
mind
had
evidently
settled
down
in
favor
of
state
organization
at
the
elections
in
april
the
people
returned
a
large
majority
in
favor
of
calling
a
constitutional
convention
this
first
move
in
the
direction
of
statehood
having
been
made
by
the
people
it
now
remained
to
take
the
several
additional
steps
of
the
election
of
delegates
to
a
constitutional
convention
the
drafting
of
a
state
constitution
the
adoption
of
such
a
constitution
by
the
people
and
the
admission
of
the
new
state
into
the
union
x
the
convention
of
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
february
and
the
act
of
june
amendatory
thereof
delegates
to
a
constitutional
convention
were
elected
at
the
general
territorial
elections
in
august
these
delegates
were
chosen
on
partisan
grounds
with
the
electorate
the
primary
question
was
not
is
the
candidate
well
grounded
in
the
principles
of
government
and
administration
but
what
are
his
political
affiliations
when
the
votes
were
counted
it
was
found
that
the
democrats
had
won
a
great
victory
the
whigs
had
not
succeeded
in
electing
one
third
of
the
whole
number
of
delegates
events
were
making
rapidly
toward
the
realization
of
state
government
on
monday

of
the
delegates
elected

in
the
old
stone
capitol
at
iowa

and
organized
themselves
into
a
constituent

meeting
was
informally

and
ephraim
mcbride
upon
being
conducted
to
the
chair
leffler
addressed
the
convention
in
a
most
earnest
manner
he
tried
to
impress
upon
the
members
the
serious
importance
of
the
work
before
them
you
meet
gentlemen
he
said
on
an
occasion
of
the
deepest
interest
we
are
in
the
progress
of
an
important
change
in
the
midst
of
an
important
revolution
things
are
to
be
done
away
and
all
things
are
to
become
new
the
structure
and
organization
of
our
government
are
to
be
changed
territorial
relations
with
the
parent
government
are
soon
to
cease
and
iowa
must
soon
take
upon
herself
the
duties
and
the
responsibilities
of
a
sovereign
state
but
before
this
important
change
can
be
fully
consummated
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
form
a
republican
constitution
for
our
domestic
government
upon
you
gentlemen
a
confiding
people
have
entrusted
this
high
responsibility
to
your
wisdom
to
your
prudence
to
your
patriotism
they
look
for
the
formation
of
that
instrument
upon
which
they
are
to
erect
the
infant
republic
under
your
auspices
the
youngest
and
fairest
daughter
of
the
whole
american
family
is
to
commence
her
separate
political
existence
to
take
her
rank
in
the
union
of
the
american
states
and
to
add
her
star
to
the
proud
flag
of
our
common
country
recollect
gentlemen
that
the
labor
of
your
hands
whatever
may
be
its
fashion
will
not
be
the
fashion
of
a
day
but
permanent
elementary
organic
it
is
not
yours
to
gild
or
to
finish
the
superstructure
but
to
sound
the
bottom
to
lay
the
foundation
to
place
the
corner
stone
unlike
the
enactments
of
mere
legislation
passed
and
sent
forth
and
recalled
your
enactments
when
ratified
by
the
people
are
to
be
permanent
and
lasting
sovereign
and
supreme
governing
controlling
and
directing
the
exercise
of
all
political
authority
executive
legislative
and
judicial
through
all
time
to
come
leffler
hoped
that
the
convention
would
frame
a
constitution
which
would
in
all
its
essential
provisions
be
as
wise
and
as
good
if
not
wiser
and
better
than
any
other
instrument
which
has
ever
yet
been
devised
for
the
government
of
mankind
so
that
iowa
young
beautiful
and
blooming
as
she
now
is
endeared
to
us
by
every
attachment
which
can
bind
us
to
our
country
may
at
no
distant
day
for
every
thing
that
is
great
noble
or
renowned
rival
if
not
surpass
the
proudest
state
of
the
american
confederacy
on
the
same
day
and
after
the
election
of
officers
the
report
of
the
committee
on
rules
was
taken
up
slightly
amended
and
adopted
in
the
afternoon
hall
who
came
from
a
back
county
in
which
no
newspapers
were
printed
moved
that
each
member
of
the
convention
have
the
privilege
of
taking
twenty
copies
weekly
of
the
newspapers
published
in
this
city
and
at
the
expense
of
the
convention
a
lively
discussion
followed
some
favored
the
motion
because
its
object
was
to
provide
the
people
with
information
concerning
the
convention
others
because
they
had
already
promised
papers
to
their
constituents
but
grant
thought
that
it
was
both
useless
and
corrupt
the
delegates
had
come
to
the
convention
with
economy
on
their
lips
and
therefore
should
resist
such
useless
expenditures
the
motion
was
lost
on
the
third
day
standing
committees
were
announced
on
the
following
subjects
bill
of
rights
executive
department
legislative
department
judicial
department
suffrage
and
citizenship
education
and
school
lands
incorporations
state
boundaries
county
organization
internal
improvements
and
state
debts
the
convention
was
now
in
condition
to
take
up
the
great
task
of
drafting
a
code
of
fundamental
law
on
thursday
the
fourth
day
the
real
work
of
the
convention
began
with
a
report
from
the
committee
on
state
boundaries
of
the
members
who
labored
in
the
convention
and
signed
the
constitution
there
were
whigs
and
democrats
of
the
delegates
were
born
in
the
south
in
the
middle
states
ten
in
the
new
england
states
ten
in
the

the
old

one

and

the
oldest
member
was
the
youngest
while
the
average
age
of
all
was
about
forty
years
as
to
occupation
or
profession
there
were
farmers
nine
lawyers
five
physicians
three
merchants
two
mechanics
two
miners
two
one
printer
one
miller
and
one
civil
engineer
the
convention
lost
no
time
in
procrastinating
delays
committees
were
prompt
in
making
reports
parliamentary
wranglings
were
infrequent
there
was
no
filibustering
the
discussions
were
as
a
rule
neither
long
wordy
nor
tiresome
indeed
the
proceedings
were
throughout
conducted
in
a
manner
the
democrats
were
determined
to
frame
a
constitution
in
accordance
with
what
they
were
pleased
to
call
the
true
principles
of
jeffersonian
democracy
and
economy
they
had
the
votes
to
carry
out
this
determination
and
yet
the
proceedings
of
the
convention
were
by
no
means
formal
and
without
enlivening
discussion
the
fragments
of
the
debates
which
have
come
down
to
us
contain
many
remarks
suggestive
of
the
life
character
and
political
ideals
of
the
people
of
early
iowa
for
example
the
discussion
concerning
newspapers
already
referred
to
brought
out
an
expression
of
the
popular
ideal
of
economy
and
frugality
to
be
sure
newspapers
containing
information
concerning
the
convention
and
the
fundamental
instrument
of
government
which
was
in
the
process
of
making
would
if
circulated
widely
throughout
the
territory
educate
and
enlighten
the
people
but
since
the
proposition
involved
the
expenditure
of
several
hundreds
of
dollars
it
was
extravagant
the
sacred
principle
of
economy
could
not
be
sacrificed
to
enlightenment
this
pioneer
ideal
of
thriftiness
persisted
among
the
iowans
for
more
than
a
generation
strict
even
to
parsimoniousness
in
the
matter
of
public
expenditures
the
pioneers
of
iowa
were
not
always
puritan
in
observing
the
forms
of
religion
their
liberal
attitude
and
their
fearless
courage
in
expressing
views
on
so
delicate
a
subject
were
displayed
in
an
interesting
debate
in
the
convention
on
a
resolution
offered
by
sells
to
the
effect
that
the
convention
be
opened
every
morning
by
prayer
to
almighty
god
chapman
favored
the
resolution
since
the
ministers
would
gladly
attend
and
render
the
services
without
compensation
gehon
objected
on
the
ground
that
it
would
not
be
economical
for
the
convention
sat
at
an
expense
of
to
per
day
and
time
was
money
hall
moved
to
amend
the
resolution
so
that
the
exercise
of
prayer
might
commence
at
least
one
half
hour
before
the
assembling
of
the
convention
but
chapman
thought
that
such
a
provision
would
be
an
insult
to
the
clergy
and
to
those
who
believed
in
the
superintendence
of
almighty
god
kirkpatrick
said
that
he
too
believed
in
a
superintending
providence
that
guided
and
controlled
our
actions
he
was
a
firm
believer
in
christianity
but
he
did
not
wish
to
enforce
prayer
upon
the
convention
prayer
he
argued
was
a
moral
precept
which
could
not
be
enforced
without
violating
or
infringing
the
natural
right
of
the
members
to
worship
god
each
in
his
own
way
if
we
can
enforce
this
moral
obligation
then
we
have
a
right
to
make
every
member
of
this
convention
go
upon
his
knees
fifty
time
a
day
kirkpatrick
cared
nothing
for
precedent
this
was
a
day
of
improvement
let
those
who
believed
so
much
in
prayer
pray
at
home
after
all
public
prayer
was
too
ostentatious
sells
was
shocked
and
would
regret
to
have
it
said
of
iowa
that
she
had
so
far
travelled
out
of
christendom
as
to
deny
the
duty
of
prayer
lucas
who
was
a
member
of
the
convention
was
astonished
at
hall
amendment
he
said
that
if
ever
an
assemblage
needed
the
aid
of
almighty
power
it
was
one
to
organize
a
system
of
government
furthermore
he
believed
that
it
was
due
to
the
religious
community
and
to
our
own
character
to
have
prayer
to
reject
the
resolution
would
he
thought
give
us
a
bad
name
abroad
hooten
reminded
lucas
of
the
story
told
of
franklin
who
when
a
boy
asked
his
father
why
he
did
not
say
grace
over
the
whole
barrel
of
pork
at
once
hall
was
opposed
to
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
convention
to
palm
themselves
off
to
be
better
than
they
really
were
and
above
all
other
things
to
assume
a
garb
of
religion
for
the
purpose
of
giving
themselves
character
he
doubted
the
efficacy
of
prayers
invoked
at
political
meetings
and
cited
an
instance
where
a
reverend
gentleman
fervently
prayed
for
the
release
of
dorr
the
election
of
polk
and
dallas
and
the
triumph
of
democratic
principles
to
believe
in
the
efficacy
of
such
a
prayer
implied
that
deity
was
a
democrat
now
if
the
almighty
was
a
democrat
he
would
perhaps
grant
the
prayer
if
not
a
democrat
he
would
not
grant
it
hall
desired
to
know
what
was
to
be
prayed
for
in
the
convention
as
for
himself
he
would
pray
as
did
the
man
in
new
orleans
that
god
would
low
and
keep
dark
and
let
us
do
the
business
of
the
convention
prayers
in
the
convention
were
he
thought
inappropriate
there
were
places
where
the
almighty
could
not
be
approached
in
a
proper
spirit
and
this
was
one
bailey
asked
the
members
who
voted
against
taking
papers
on
the
grounds
of
economy
to
be
consistent
and
vote
against
this
resolution
to
have
prayers
it
would
save
some
two
or
three
hundred
dollars
then
too
he
thought
that
people
were
becoming
more
liberal
in
their
religious
sentiment
no
man
could
say
that
he
ever
opposed
another
on
account
of
religion
he
respected
men
who
were
sincerely
religious
but
he
wanted
to
have
his
own
opinions
bailey
feared
that
members
might
be
compelled
under
the
resolution
to
hear
what
they
were
opposed
to
this
was
contrary
to
the
inalienable
rights
of
man
if
members
did
not
feel
disposed
to
come
it
took
away
their
happiness
contrary
to
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
principle
laid
down
by
thomas
jefferson
the
apostle
of
liberty
cutler
said
that
he
had
not
lived
a
great
while
but
long
enough
not
to
be
afraid
of
meeting
such
a
question
openly
he
opposed
the
resolution
and
desired
the
yeas
and
nays
recorded
on
the
motion
fletcher
regretted
the
opposition
that
he
saw
and
was
unwilling
that
it
should
go
forth
to
the
world
that
iowa
refused
to
acknowledge
a
god
evans
did
not
believe
in
progression
to
the
exclusion
of
prayer
he
favored
providing
a
room
for
those
who
did
not
wish
to
hear
prayers
hepner
opposed
the
resolution
because
he
thought
that
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
principle
of
religious
freedom
as
set
forth
in
the
bill
of
rights
shelleday
wished
to
represent
the
moral
and
religious
feelings
of
his
constituents
by
supporting
the
resolution
quinton
thought
that
his
constituents
were
as
moral
as
those
of
shelleday
but
he
did
not
believe
praying
would
change
the
purposes
of
deity
nor
the
views
of
members
of
the
convention
in
the
name
of
heaven
he
exclaimed
do
force
men
to
hear
prayers
by
a
vote
of
to
the
resolution
was
indefinitely
postponed
the
liberal
religious
spirit
of
the
pioneers
is
further
evidenced
by
the
principle
of
toleration
which
was
incorporated
into
section
four
of
the
bill
of
rights
as
introduced
by
the
committee
the
section
provided
that
no
religious
test
shall
be
required
as
qualification
for
any
office
or
public
trust
and
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
any
of
his
rights
privileges
capacities
or
disqualified
for
the
performance
of
any
of
his
duties
public
or
private
in
consequence
of
his
opinion
on
the
subject
of
religion
grant
thought
that
the
report
was
meant
to
cover
but
to
make
sure
that
it
did
not
exclude
atheists
from
giving
testimony
in
the
courts
galbraith
moved
to
insert
the
words
or
be
rendered
incompetent
to
give
testimony
in
any
court
of
law
or
equity
lowe
of
muscatine
favored
leaving
the
law
on
this
subject
as
it
was
that
is
he
thought
that
atheists
should
not
be
admitted
to
give
testimony
because
there
was
nothing
that
such
a
person
could
swear
by
an
oath
called
upon
deity
to
witness
the
truth
of
what
was
said
and
to
withdraw
his
favor
from
the
person
if
it
was
untrue
atheists
consequently
could
not
take
an
oath
it
would
be
unsafe
to
permit
them
to
testify
hempstead
wanted
to
do
away
with
this
inquiring
into
a
religious
opinions
he
desired
to
keep
it
out
of
the
constitution
it
was
the
fear
of
the
penalties
of
perjury
that
restrained
men
from
stating
what
was
not
true
not
future
punishment
kirkpatrick
thought
that
to
refuse
to
allow
atheists
to
testify
would
be
an
infringement
of
the
natural
rights
of
man
grant
said
that
he
hoped
this
convention
would
take
high
grounds
upon
this
subject
and
silence
these
inquiries
into
belief
and
exclusions
for
opinion
sake
when
the
test
vote
was
taken
it
was
found
that
only
ten
members
of
the
convention
were
willing
to
deny
to
atheists
the
right
to
give
testimony
in
the
courts
an
interesting
debate
on
salaries
led
to
the
adoption
of
section
article
of
the
constitution
which
fixed
the
compensation
of
the
state
officers
for
the
first
ten
years
after
the
organization
of
the
government
the
discussion
was
provoked
by
a
report
from
the
committee
on
state
revenue
in
which
the
following
salaries
were
recommended
for
governor
for
secretary
of
state
for
treasurer
for
auditor
for
superintendent
of
public
instruction
and
for
judges
of
the
supreme
court
several
motions
were
made
which
aimed
to
increase
slightly
the
sums
recommended
by
the
committee
but
the
bent
of
the
convention
was
manifestly
in
favor
of
a
reduction
of
salaries
all
along
the
line
sums
ranging
from
to
were
suggested
for
the
governor
hooten
thought
the
salary
was
about
right
at
the
governor
was
rather
than
else
considered
as
public
property
would
have
to
entertain
a
good
deal
of
company
and
should
have
a
pretty
liberal
salary
davidson
said
that
he
came
here
for
low
salaries
he
did
not
like
but
was
worse
the
convention
finally
agreed
upon
as
a
proper
salary
for
the
governor
of
the
state
of
iowa
no
cut
was
made
in
the
sum
reported
for
the
secretary
of
state
but
the
treasurer
salary
was
reduced
to
the
convention
was
willing
that
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
should
receive
the
same
pay
as
the
governor
that
is
the
auditor
salary
received
the
most
attention
the
committee
on
state
revenue
had
recommended
grant
moved
to
strike
out
which
would
leave
the
salary
blank
lucas
hoped
that
the
salaries
would
not
be
reduced
so
low
that
competent
men
could
not
afford
to
accept
them
chapman
desired
to
pay
a
fair
price
for
services
rendered
but
he
was
not
willing
to
pay
a
single
dollar
for
dignity
he
did
not
want
to
have
men
paid
to
live
as
gentlemen
with
no
services
to
perform
what
were
the
duties
of
auditor
that
they
could
not
be
performed
for
a
salary
of
or
a
farmer
toiled
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
to
its
going
down
and
at
the
end
of
the
year
had
not
perhaps
there
were
hundreds
of
men
qualified
for
that
office
who
labored
the
whole
year
for
less
than
half
of
in
this
country
we
are
all
poor
and
have
to
do
with
but
little
strong
came
to
the
convention
with
a
desire
for
economy
and
felt
disposed
to
go
for
as
low
salaries
as
any
man
but
he
thought
gentlemen
were
disposed
to
reduce
them
too
low
hempstead
thought
that
the
convention
was
running
this
thing
of
economy
into
the
ground
he
knew
that
there
were
men
who
would
take
the
offices
at
almost
any
salary
but
they
would
plunder
to
make
it
up
quinton
declared
that
the
services
rendered
by
the
auditor
were
not
worth
more
than
he
would
continue
to
advocate
economy
in
the
state
offices
whether
it
was
displeasing
to
some
gentlemen
or
not
fletcher
supported
the
recommendation
of
the
committee
on
state
revenue
because
the
object
was
to
secure
as
auditor
a
man
of
the
best
business
talents
hall
observed
that
the
proposition
to
pay
such
large
salaries
to
our
officers
was
based
upon
a
misunderstanding
of
the
importance
of
our
little
state
we
were
just
commencing
to
totter
and
not
to
walk
harrison
said
we
were
in
a
youthful
condition
and
were
poor
and
we
could
not
afford
to
pay
such
salaries
as
the
great
and
wealthy
state
of
ohio
furthermore
he
wanted
the
officers
to
share
something
of
the
hardships
and
privations
of
the
citizens
he
would
not
have
them
gentlemen
of
leisure
walking
about
the
streets
talking
with
their
friends
with
plenty
of
money
in
their
pockets
an
honest
man
would
perform
the
duties
of
auditor
as
well
for
as
if
he
was
not
honest
we
did
not
want
him
bissell
favored
a
reduction
he
did
not
want
to
support
government
officers
at
high
salaries
to
ride
about
in
their
coaches
and
sport
gold
spectacles
he
did
not
want
them
paid
for
giving
wine
parties
and
electioneering
the
legislature
they
should
walk
from
their
residences
to
their
offices
as
other
citizens
and
so
the
salary
of
auditor
was
fixed
at
what
wonder
that
hempstead
felt
disposed
to
make
a
motion
that
no
gentleman
or
man
of
respectability
should
be
appointed
to
any
office
under
the
government
of
the
state
of
iowa
from
the
fragments
of
the
debates
which
were
chronicled
in
the
newspapers
of
the
capital
it
is
clear
that
the
convention
of
in
providing
for
the
exercise
of
executive
power
in
iowa
aimed
to
make
the
chief
magistracy
a
representative
institution
and
to
limit
the
influence
of
the
governor
in
legislation
the
committee
on
the
executive
department
of
which
the
venerable
lucas
was
the
chairman
reported
in
favor
of
vesting
the
supreme
executive
power
in
a
governor
who
shall
hold
his
office
for
four
years
a
lieutenant
governor
was
to
be
chosen
at
the
same
time
and
for
the
same
term
furthermore
section
five
of
the
report
provided
that
no
person
shall
be
eligible
to
the
office
of
governor
or
lieutenant
governor
more
than
eight
years
in
any
term
of
twelve
chapman
made
a
motion
to
strike
out
the
provisions
relative
to
a
lieutenant
governor
which
motion
he
enforced
upon
the
principle
of
economy
and
the
of
the
office
but
the
convention
refused
to
take
a
step
so
radical
langworthy
moved
to
strike
out
and
insert
as
the
term
for
which
the
governor
should
hold
his
office
this
was
to
test
whether
any
officer
in
the
state
of
iowa
was
to
hold
his
office
more
than
two
years
langworthy
wanted
the
whole
government
to
be
changed
once
in
two
years
his
motion
prevailed
on
the
motion
of
peck
section
five
of
the
report
which
aimed
to
prevent
the
governor
and
lieutenant
governor
from
succeeding
themselves
in
office
more
than
once
in
twelve
years
was
stricken
out
the
question
of
an
executive
veto
on
legislation
naturally
received
considerable
attention
since
the
administration
of
lucas
was
still
fresh
in
the
minds
of
many
members
of
the
convention
the
committee
on
the
legislative
department
had
reported
a
form
of
executive
veto
which
was
so
limited
that
it
could
be
passed
over
by
an
ordinary
majority
in
the
two
branches
of
the
general
assembly
peck
favored
a
majority
of
the
members
present
but
hall
moved
to
strike
out
the
whole
section
and
said
that
in
making
this
constitution
he
wished
to
throw
off
the
trammels
of
fashion
and
precedent
he
had
so
pledged
himself
to
his
constituents
this
veto
power
was
a
trammel
and
an
unnecessary
restraint
on
the
freedom
of
legislation
the
law
of
progress
required
that
it
should
be
abolished
bailey
thought
the
veto
power
was
a
valuable
one
it
was
the
people
power
the
governor
was
more
the
representative
of
the
people
than
the
representatives
themselves
the
representatives
were
chosen
by
sections
and
represented
local
interests
and
they
might
continue
to
pass
bad
laws
but
the
governor
had
no
local
feelings
peck
said
that
the
veto
power
was
a
qualified
negative
to
prevent
hasty
and
legislation
he
declared
that
the
executive
veto
was
a
wholesome
remedy
for
it
was
a
democratic
feature
of
any
constitution
lucas
took
part
in
the
discussion
we
were
he
said
engaged
in
making
a
constitution
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
people
the
veto
was
one
of
the
instruments
that
had
been
used
to
defend
the
people
rights
it
might
have
been
exercised
imprudently
at
times
but
that
was
not
a
good
argument
against
the
power
hall
discussed
the
question
at
length
gentlemen
he
said
supposed
that
the
legislature
might
be
corrupt
he
would
suppose
on
the
other
hand
that
the
governor
might
he
corrupt
and
his
supposition
was
as
good
as
theirs
some
gentlemen
were
afraid
of
the
tyranny
of
the
representatives
he
would
suppose
that
the
governor
would
be
the
tyrant
or
he
would
suppose
that
the
governor
would
combine
with
the
legislature
and
they
would
all
be
corrupt
and
tyrannical
together
a
number
of
persons
were
not
so
liable
to
corruption
and
combination
as
a
single
individual
just
as
numbers
increased
the
probability
of
corruption
decreased
he
declared
that
there
was
no
need
of
the
power
in
this
territory
the
convention
finally
agreed
upon
the
form
of
the
limited
executive
veto
as
provided
for
in
the
federal
constitution
not
even
the
judiciary
was
spared
from
the
influence
of
western
democracy
as
it
rose
up
and
asserted
itself
in
the
convention
of
the
day
of
executive
appointment
and
life
tenure
of
judges
had
passed
or
was
passing
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
recommended
that
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
and
district
court
shall
be
elected
by
the
joint
vote
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
and
hold
their
offices
for
six
years
but
a
minority
report
introduced
by
fletcher
proposed
that
all
of
the
judges
be
elected
by
the
qualified
voters
of
the
state
in
discussing
this
question
the
convention
desired
to
follow
the
wishes
of
the
people
but
it
was
not
known
that
the
people
themselves
really
desired
to
elect
the
judges
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
evidence
that
anyone
favored
executive
appointment
so
the
question
before
the
convention
was
shall
the
judges
be
elected
by
the
people
or
shall
they
be
chosen
by
the
general
assembly
hempstead
favored
direct
election
by
the
people
on
the
assumption
that
in
a
republican
or
democratic
government
the
people
were
sovereign
and
all
power
resided
in
them
he
did
not
believe
that
the
influence
of
politics
would
be
worse
in
the
election
of
judges
by
the
people
than
in
the
election
of
members
of
the
general
assembly
joint
ballot
he
declared
was
one
of
the
most
corrupt
methods
of
election
ever
devised
bailey
did
not
doubt
the
capacity
of
the
people
to
elect
their
judges
but
he
thought
that
there
was
real
danger
in
the
judges
becoming
corrupt
through
political
influences
they
were
liable
to
form
partialities
and
prejudices
in
the
canvass
that
would
operate
on
the
bench
he
had
no
objection
to
the
people
electing
the
judges
but
he
did
not
think
they
desired
the
election
they
had
never
asked
to
have
it
lucas
said
the
question
would
seem
to
be
whether
there
was
any
officer
in
the
government
whose
duties
were
so
sacred
that
they
could
not
be
elected
by
the
people
all
officers
were
servants
of
the
people
from
the
president
down
he
repudiated
the
idea
that
the
people
were
not
capable
of
electing
their
own
servants
quinton
supported
the
proposition
to
elect
the
judges
since
this
was
said
to
be
an
age
of
progress
in
his
opinion
the
ends
of
justice
would
be
better
served
by
elections
by
the
people
than
by
the
legislature
kirkpatrick
declared
that
the
selection
of
judges
by
the
general
assembly
was
wrong
both
in
principle
and
in
policy
he
was
opposed
to
voting
by
proxy
he
believed
that
we
should
choose
our
judges
ourselves
and
bring
them
often
to
the
ballot
box
fletcher
came
pledged
to
go
for
the
election
of
judges
by
the
people
he
believed
that
the
surest
guaranty
which
could
be
had
for
the
fidelity
and
good
conduct
of
all
public
officers
was
to
make
them
directly
responsible
to
the
people
the
outcome
of
the
discussion
was
a
compromise
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
were
to
be
named
by
the
general
assembly
but
the
judges
of
the
district
court
were
to
be
elected
by
the
people
that
the
pioneers
of
iowa
including
the
members
of
the
convention
of
were
democratic
in
their
ideals
is
certain
they
believed
in
equality
they
had
faith
in
jeffersonianism
they
clung
to
the
dogmas
of
the
declaration
of
independence
they
were
sure
that
all
men
were
born
equal
and
that
government
to
be
just
must
be
instituted
by
and
with
the
consent
of
the
governed
such
was
their
professed
philosophy
was
it
universally
applicable
or
did
the
system
have
limitations
did
the
declaration
of
independence
for
example
include
negroes
the
attitude
of
the
convention
on
this
perplexing
problem
was
perhaps
fairly
represented
in
the
report
of
a
select
committee
to
whom
had
been
referred
a
petition
of
sundry
citizens
praying
for
the
admission
of
people
of
color
on
the
same
footing
as
white
citizens
this
same
committee
had
also
been
instructed
to
inquire
into
the
propriety
of
a
constitutional
provision
prohibiting
persons
of
color
from
settling
within
the
state
in
the
opening
paragraph
of
their
remarkable
report
the
committee
freely
admitted
that
all
men
are
created
equal
and
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
inalienable
rights
and
that
these
rights
are
as
sacred
to
the
black
man
as
the
white
man
and
should
be
so
regarded
at
the
same
time
they
looked
upon
this
declaration
as
a
mere
abstract
proposition
which
although
strictly
true
when
applied
to
man
in
a
state
of
nature
becomes
very
much
modified
when
man
is
considered
in
the
artificial
state
in
which
government
and
society
place
him
the
committee
then
argued
that
government
is
an
institution
or
an
association
entered
into
by
man
the
very
constitution
of
which
changes
or
modifies
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
his
natural
rights
some
are
surrendered
others
are
modified
in
forming
or
maintaining
a
government
it
is
the
privilege
and
duty
of
those
who
are
about
to
associate
together
for
that
purpose
to
modify
and
limit
the
rights
or
wholly
exclude
from
the
association
any
and
every
species
of
persons
who
would
endanger
lessen
or
in
the
least
impair
the
enjoyment
of
these
rights
we
have
seen
that
the
application
of
this
principle
limits
the
rights
of
our
sons
modifies
the
privileges
of
our
wives
and
daughters
and
would
not
be
unjust
if
it
excluded
the
negro
is
the
party
to
the
compact
that
should
complain
not
the
stranger
even
hospitality
does
not
sanction
complaint
under
such
circumstances
true
these
persons
may
be
unfortunate
but
the
government
is
not
unjust
thus
the
problem
of
negro
citizenship
was
not
one
of
abstract
right
but
must
be
settled
on
grounds
of
expediency
would
the
admission
of
the
negro
as
a
citizen
tend
in
the
least
to
lessen
endanger
or
impair
the
enjoyment
of
our
governmental
institutions
the
answer
of
the
committee
reads
as
follows
however
your
committee
may
commiserate
with
the
degraded
condition
of
the
negro
and
feel
for
his
fate
yet
they
can
never
consent
to
open
the
doors
of
our
beautiful
state
and
invite
him
to
settle
our
lands
the
policy
of
other
states
would
drive
the
whole
black
population
of
the
union
upon
us
the
ballot
box
would
fall
into
their
hands
and
a
train
of
evils
would
follow
that
in
the
opinion
of
your
committee
would
be
incalculable
the
rights
of
persons
would
be
less
secure
and
private
property
materially
impaired
the
injustice
to
the
white
population
would
be
beyond
computation
there
are
strong
reasons
to
induce
the
belief
that
the
two
races
could
not
exist
in
the
same
government
upon
an
equality
without
discord
and
violence
that
might
eventuate
in
insurrection
bloodshed
and
final
extermination
of
one
of
the
two
races
no
one
can
doubt
that
a
degraded
prostitution
of
moral
feeling
would
ensue
a
tendency
to
amalgamate
the
two
races
would
be
superinduced
a
degraded
and
reckless
population
would
follow
idleness
crime
and
misery
would
come
in
their
train
and
government
itself
fall
into
anarchy
or
despotism
having
these
views
of
the
subject
your
committee
think
it
inexpedient
to
grant
the
prayer
of
the
petition
nor
was
it
thought
expedient
by
the
committee
to
introduce
an
article
into
the
constitution
which
would
exclude
altogether
persons
of
color
from
the
state
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
people
of
iowa
did
not
want
negroes
swarming
among
them
even
langworthy
who
had
been
instructed
by
his
constituents
to
get
something
put
into
the
constitution
by
which
negroes
might
be
excluded
from
the
state
felt
that
the
matter
could
safely
be
left
with
the
general
assembly
grant
thought
that
an
exclusion
clause
in
the
constitution
would
endanger
our
admission
into
the
union
although
the
report
was
laid
on
the
table
it
nevertheless
represented
the
dominant
opinion
then
prevalent
in
iowa
our
pioneer
forefathers
believed
that
the
negroes
were
men
entitled
to
freedom
and
civil
liberty
but
more
than
a
score
of
years
had
yet
to
elapse
before
there
was
in
their
minds
no
longer
a
doubt
that
all
men
including
the
negroes
are
created
free
and
equal
when
the
delegates
were
elected
to
the
convention
of
the
people
of
the
territory
were
still
suffering
from
the
effects
of
panic
and
general
economic
depression
many
of
them
still
felt
the
sting
of
recent
bank
failures
and
the
evils
of
a
depreciated
currency
hence
it
is
not
surprising
to
learn
from
the
debates
that
not
a
few
of
the
delegates
came
to
the
convention
instructed
to
oppose
all
propositions
which
in
any
way
favored
corporations
especially
banking
corporations
the
opposition
to
banks
and
bank
money
was
not
local
it
was
national
the
bank
problem
had
become
a
leading
party
issue
democrats
opposed
and
whigs
generally
favored
the
banks
it
was
so
in
iowa
where
the
agitation
was
enlivened
by
the
presence
of
the
miners

of

bank

to
it

been
investigated
four
times
by
the

whig
members
of
the
convention
were
inclined
to
keep
restrictions
out
of
the
constitution
and
leave
the
whole
question
of
establishing
banks
to
the
general
assembly
the
democrats
were
not
united
the
more
radical
supported
the
minority
report
others
favored
the
establishment
of
banks
well
guarded
with
restrictions
hempstead
said
that
he
was
opposed
to
all
banks
as
a
matter
of
principle
he
pointed
out
that
there
were
three
kinds
of
banks
banks
of
deposit
banks
of
discount
and
banks
of
circulation
to
this
last
kind
he
objected
they
were
founded
in
wrong
and
founded
in
error
he
declared
that
such
corporations
should
be
excluded
altogether
from
the
state
indeed
he
said
that
if
the
whole
concern
banks
officers
and
all
could
be
sent
to
the
penitentiary
he
would
be
very
glad
of
it
quinton
thought
that
the
whole
concern
of
banks
from
big
a
down
were
a
set
of
swindling
machines
and
now
was
the
time
for
the
people
of
iowa
to
give
an
eternal
quietus
to
the
whole
concern
ripley
declared
that
banks
had
always
been
a
curse
to
the
country
he
believed
banks
to
be
unconstitutional
and
oppressive
upon
the
laboring
classes
of
the
community
bailey
was
an
man
but
he
knew
many
democrats
who
were
in
favor
of
banks
under
proper
restrictions
hall
said
that
banking
was
a
spoiled
child
it
had
been
nursed
and
petted
till
it
had
become
corrupt
he
objected
to
banking
because
it
conferred
privileges
upon
one
class
that
other
classes
did
not
enjoy
he
believed
that
the
people
would
find
that
a
bank
of
earth
is
the
best
bank
and
the
best
share
a
gehon
wanted
to
put
his
feet
upon
the
neck
of
this
common
enemy
of
mankind
lucas
who
represented
the
conservative
democrats
said
that
this
was
not
a
party
issue
but
rather
a
question
of
expediency
he
was
in
favor
of
leaving
it
to
the
legislature
and
the
people
lowe
said
that
the
truth
was
this
matter
like
all
other
questions
of
internal
policy
should
be
left
where
all
the
other
states
of
the
union
have
left
it
to
the
sovereign
will
of
a
free
and
independent
people
hawkins
said
that
the
whigs
were
in
favor
of
leaving
this
matter
to
the
action
of
future
legislatures
and
to
the
people
when
a
proposition
was
made
for
a
charter
let

people
article
xiii
provides
a
schedule
for
the
transition
from
the
territorial
to
the
state
organization
from
the
of
subsequent
events
the
most
significant
provision
of
the
constitution
of
was
the
one
which
defined
the
boundaries
of
the
future
state
there
is
however
no
evidence
that
the
members
of
the
convention
foresaw
the
probability
of
a
dispute
with
congress
on
this
point
although
governor
chambers
in
his
message
of
december
had
pointed
out
its
possibility
should
the
people
of
iowa
assume
to
give
boundaries
to
the
state
without
first
making
application
to
congress
for
definite
limits
it
was
on
the
question
of
boundaries
that
the
constitution
of
was
wrecked
in
the
convention
the
regular
standing
committee
on
state
boundaries
reported
in
favor
of
certain
lines
which
were
in
substance
the
boundaries
recommended
by
governor
lucas
in
his
message
of
november
indeed
it
is
altogether
probable
that
the
recommendations
of
robert
lucas
were
made
the
basis
of
the
committee
report
this
inference
is
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
the
illustrious
was
a
member
of
the
committee
it
will
be
convenient
to
refer
to
the
boundaries
recommended
by
the
committee
as
the
the
lucas
boundaries
were
based
upon
the
topography
of
the
country
as
determined
by
rivers
on
the
east
was
the
great
mississippi
on
the
west
the
missouri
and
on
the
north
the
peters
these
natural
boundaries
were
to
be
connected
and
made
continuous
by
the
artificial
lines
of
the
surveyor
as
to
the
proposed
eastern
boundary
there
could
be
no
difference
of
opinion
and
it
was
generally
felt
that
the
missouri
river
should
determine
the
western
limit
on
the
south
the
boundary
must
necessarily
be
the
northern
line
of
the
state
of
missouri
but
the
exact
location
of
this
line
had
not
been
authoritatively
determined
during
the
administration
of
lucas
it
was
the
subject
of
a
heated
controversy
between
missouri
and
iowa
which
at
one
time
bordered
on
armed
hostility
the
purpose
of
the
convention
in
was
not
to
settle
the
dispute
but
to
refer
to
the
line
in
a
way
which
would
neither
prejudice
nor
compromise
the
claims
of
iowa
the
discussion
of
the
northern
boundary
was
in
the
light
of
subsequent
events
more
significant
as
proposed
by
the
committee
the
line
was
perhaps
a
little
vague
and
indefinite
since
the
exact
location
of
certain
rivers
named
was
not
positively
known
some
thought
that
the
boundary
proposed
would
make
the
state
too
large
others
thought
that
it
would
make
the
state
too
small
hall
proposed
the
parallel
of
and
degrees
of
north
latitude
peck
suggested
the
parallel
of
langworthy
of
dubuque
asked
that
degrees
be
made
the
northern
limit
langworthy
proposition
met
with
considerable
favor
among
the
people
living
in
the
northern
part
of
the
territory
who
desired
to
increase
the
size
of
the
state
by
including
a
considerable
tract
north
of
the
peters
chapman
suggests
the
existence
of
sectional
feeling
in
the
matter
of
boundaries
when
he
says
in
reply
to
langworthy
argument
that
it
was
a
kind
of
creeping
up
on
the
north
which
was
not
good
faith
to
the
south
on
october
the
report
of
the
regular
committee
on
state
boundaries
was
referred
to
a
select
committee
consisting
of
representatives
from
the
twelve
electoral
districts
but
this
committee
made
no
changes
in
the
original
report
except
to
make
the
northern
boundary
a
little
more
definite
as
finally
adopted
by
the
convention
and
incorporated
into
the
constitution
of
the
boundaries
of
the
state
were
as
follows
beginning
in
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
the
mississippi
river
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
des
moines
river
thence
up
the
said
river
des
moines
in
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
thereof
to
a
point
where
it
is
intersected
by
the
old
indian
boundary
line
or
line
run
by
john
sullivan
in
the
year
thence
westwardly
along
said
line
to
the
northwest
corner
of
missouri
thence
due
west
to
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
the
missouri
river
thence
up
in
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
the
river
last
mentioned
to
the
mouth
of
the
sioux
or
calumet
river
thence
in
a
direct
line
to
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
the
peters
river
where
the
watonwan
river
according
to
nicollet
map
enters
the
same
thence
down
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
said
river
to
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
the
mississippi
river
thence
down
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
said
river
to
the
place
of
beginning
in

with
the
act
of
the
legislative
assembly
of

was

for
such
admission
at

early
day

relied
upon
the
guarantee
in

third
article

from

laid
before

a
copy
of

instrument
together
with
an
ordinance
and
a
memorial
from
the
iowa
convention
here
the
documents
were
referred
to
the
committee
on

on

through
aaron

the
committee
on

reported
a
bill
for
the
admission
of
iowa
and
florida
into
the
union
this
bill
was
read
twice
and
referred
to
the
committee
of
the
whole
house
on
the
state
of

wherein
it
was
considered
on

three
days

without

by

vote
of
to
nine
on

the
act
received
the
signature
of
president
tyler
the
debate
on
the
bill
for
the
admission
of
iowa
under
the
constitution
of
is
of
more
than
local
interest
since
it
involved
a
consideration
of
the
great
question
of
national
politics
in
its
relation
to
the
growth
of
the
west
and
the
admission
of
new
states
when
iowa
applied
for
state
organization
in
florida
had
been
waiting
and
pleading
for
admission
ever
since
the
year
the
reason
for
this
delay
was
very
generally
understood
and
openly
avowed
states
should
be
admitted
not
singly
but
in
pairs
florida
was
waiting
for
a
companion
and
so
in
it
fell
to
iowa
to
be
paired
with
the
peninsula
the
principle
involved
was
not
new
but
never
before
had
two
states
been
coupled
in
the
same
act
of
admission
the
object
sought
was
plainly
the
maintenance
of
a
of
between
the
north
and
the
south
but
back
of
the
principle
of
the
balance
of
power
and
for
the
preservation
of
which
that
principle
was
invoked
stood
slavery
the
institution
of
free
labor
in
the
north
must
be
balanced
by
the
institution
of
slave
labor
in
the
south
since
both
must
be
preserved
and
so
the
admission
of
iowa
and
florida
had
to
be
determined
in
reference
to
this
question
of
national
politics
upon
examination
it
was
found
that
the
proposed
constitution
of
florida
not
only
sanctioned
the
institution
of
slavery
but
it
positively
guaranteed
its
perpetuation
by
restraining
the
general
assembly
from
ever
passing
laws
under
which
slaves
might
be
emancipated
on
the
other
hand
the
constitution
of
iowa
although
it
did
not
extend
the
privilege
of
suffrage
to
persons
of
color
provided
that
neither
slavery
nor
involuntary
servitude
unless
for
the
punishment
of
crimes
shall
ever
be
tolerated
in
this
state
now
it
so
happened
that
the
opposing
forces
of
slave
labor
and
free
labor
of
state
rights
and
union
came
to
an
issue
over
the
boundaries
of
the
proposed
state
of
iowa
in
the
bill
for
admission
as
reported
by
the
house
committee
on
territories
the
boundaries
asked
for
by
the
iowa
convention
in
the
constitution
submitted
by
them
were
retained
without
alteration
but
duncan
of
ohio
had
other
limits
to
propose
he
would
have
the
new
state
of
iowa
bounded
by
the
mississippi
on
the
east
by
a
parallel
of
latitude
passing
through
the
mouth
of
the
mankato
or
blue
earth
river
on
the
north
by
a
meridian
line
running
equidistant
from
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
degrees
of
longitude
west
from
washington
on
the
west
and
by
the
northern
boundary
of
the
missouri
on
the
south
duncan
pointed
out
that
these
were
the
boundaries
proposed
by
nicollet
in
the
report
which
accompanied
the
publication
in
january
of
his
map
of
the
basin
of
the
upper
mississippi
he
preferred
the
because
they
were
the
boundaries
of
nature
and
at
the
same
time
they
left
sufficient
territory
for
the
formation
of
two
other
states
in
that
western
country
on
the
other
hand
brown
chairman
of
the
committee
on
territories
said
that
the
question
of
boundaries
had
been
carefully
investigated
by
his
committee
and
the
conclusion
to
which
they
had
come
was
to
adhere
to
the
boundary
asked
for
by
the
people
of
iowa
who
were
there
who
had
settled
the
country
and
whose
voice
should
be
listened
to
in
the
matter
belser
of
alabama
was
opposed
to
the
duncan
amendment
since
it
aimed
to
admit
as
a
state
only
a
portion
of
iowa
at
this
time
this
he
would
have
no
objection
to
provided
florida
is
treated
in
the
same
way
he
was
for
receiving
both
into
the
confederacy
with
like
terms
and
restrictions
if
iowa
is
to
come
in
without
dismemberment
then
let
florida
enter
in
like
manner
but
if
iowa
is
divided
then
let
florida
be
divided
also
vinton
of
ohio
was
the
most
vigorous
champion
of
the
duncan
amendment
he
stood
out
firmly
for
a
reduction
of
the
boundaries
proposed
by
the
iowa
convention
because
the
country
to
the
north
and
west
of
the
new
state
from
which
two
other
states
ought
to
be
formed
would
be
left
in
a
very
inconvenient
shape
and
because
the
formation
of
such
large
states
would
deprive
the
west
of
its
due
share
of
power
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
vinton
was
particularly
anxious
that
a
state
of
unsuitable
extent
should
not
be
made
in
that
part
of
the
western
country
in
consequence
of
the
unwise
and
mistaken
policy
towards
that
section
of
the
union
which
has
hitherto
prevailed
in
forming
western
states
by
which
the
great
valley
of
the
mississippi
has
been
deprived
and
irrevocably
so
of
its
due
share
in
the
legislation
of
the
country
as
an
equitable
compensation
to
the
west
for
this
injustice
he
would
make
a
series
of
small
states
on
the
west
bank
of
the
mississippi
furthermore
vinton
did
not
think
it
politic
to
curtail
the
power
of
the
west
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
by
the
establishment
of
large
states
since
in
his
opinion
the
power
of
controlling
this
government
in
all
its
departments
may
be
more
safely
intrusted
to
the
west
than
in
any
other
hands
the
commercial
interests
of
the
people
of
the
west
were
such
as
to
make
them
desirous
of
protecting
the
capital
and
labor
both
of
the
north
and
the
south
again
he
declared
that
if
disunion
should
ever
be
attempted
the
west
must
and
will
rally
to
a
man
under
the
flag
of
the
union
to
preserve
this
union
to
make
its
existence
immortal
is
the
high
destiny
assigned
by
providence
itself
to
this
great
central
power
the
arguments
for
restriction
prevailed
and
the
duncan
amendment
which
proposed
to
substitute
the
for
the
passed
the
house
of
representatives
by
a
vote
of
to
forty
in
the
senate
the
bill
as
reported
from
the
house
was
hurried
through
without
much
debate
here
the
question
of
boundaries
seems
to
have
received
no
consideration
whatever
there
were
however
strong
objections
in
some
quarters
to
coupling
iowa
with
florida
in
the
matter
of
admission
senator
choate
of
massachusetts
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
was
the
first
instance
in
the
history
of
the
admission
of
states
where
it
was
proposed
to
admit
two
states
by
the
same
act
under
the
circumstances
he
could
welcome
iowa
into
the
union
but
he
could
not
give
his
hand
to
florida
it
could
not
be
argued
that
florida
must
be
admitted
to
balance
iowa
since
the
admission
of
texas
was
already
more
than
a
balance
for
the
northern
state
however
appropriate
it
might
have
been
at
an
earlier
day
to
pair
florida
with
iowa
it
ought
not
to
be
thought
of
at
this
time
for
since
the
introduction
of
the
bill
we
have
admitted
a
territory
on
the
southwest
much
larger
than
iowa
and
florida
together
a
territory
that
may
be
cut
up
into
forty
states
larger
than
our
small
states
or
five
or
six
states
as
large
as
our
largest
states
where
and
how
is
the
balance
to
be
found
by
the
north
and
east
for
texas
where
is
it
to
be
found
but
in
the
steadfast
part
of
america
if
not
there
it
can
be
found
nowhere
else
god
grant
it
may
be
there
everything
has
been
changed
an
empire
in
one
region
of
the
country
has
been
added
to
the
union
look
east
west
or
north
and
you
can
find
no
balance
for
that
senator
evans
touched
upon
the
great
issue
when
he
proposed
an
amendment
which
provided
that
so
far
as
florida
was
concerned
the
bill
should
not
take
effect
until
the
people
had
removed
from
their
constitution
certain
restrictions
on
the
general
assembly
relative
to
the
emancipation
of
slaves
and
the
emigration
and
immigration
of
free
negroes
or
other
persons
of
color
he
was
opposed
to
discriminations
against
free
persons
of
color
why
then
retorted
a
senator
from
the
south
do
you
not
direct
your
artillery
against
the
constitution
of
iowa
which
does
not
allow
a
colored
person
to
vote
no
good
reason
had
been
urged
showing
why
iowa
should
not
be
admitted
into
the
union
all
of
the
essential
qualifications
for
statehood
were
present
a
large
and
homogeneous
population
wealth
and
republican
political
institutions
congress
did
not
pass
an
adverse
judgment
on
the
constitution
of
since
that
instrument
provided
for
a
government
which
was
republican
in
form
and
satisfactory
in
minor
details
only
one
change
was
demanded
and
that
was
in
relation
to
the
proposed
boundaries
here
congress
insisted
upon
the
as
incorporated
in
the
act
of
admission
of
march
in
opposition
to
the
as
provided
for
in
the
constitution
of
xiii
the
constitution
of
debated
and
defeated
by
the
people
while
congress
was
discussing
the
boundaries
of
iowa
and
carefully
considering
the
effect
which
the
admission
of
the
new
state
might
possibly
have
upon
matters
of
national
concern
the
constitution
of
was
being
subjected
to
analysis
and
criticism
throughout
the
territory
moreover
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
only
provision
of
the
constitution
which
was
held
up
and
debated
in
congress
was
the
very
one
which
was
generally
accepted
by
the
people
of
the
territory
without
comment
whigs
and
democrats
alike
were
satisfied
with
the
nor
did
the
people
of
iowa
at
this
time
think
or
care
anything
about
the
preservation
of
the
balance
of
power
their
adoption
of
and
adherence
to
the
was
founded
upon
local
pride
and
commercial
considerations
opposition
to
the
constitution
of
was
at
the
outset
largely
a
matter
of
partisan
feeling
the
whigs
very
naturally
opposed
the
ratification
of
a
code
of
fundamental
law
which
had
been
formulated
by
a
democratic
majority
then
too
they
could
not
hope
for
many
of
the
federal
and
state
offices
which
would
be
opened
to
iowans
after
the
establishment
of
commonwealth
organization
and
so
with
genuine
partisan
zeal
they
attacked
the
instrument
from
preamble
to
schedule
nothing
escaped
their
ridicule
and
sarcasm
by
the
democratic
press
they
were
charged
with
an
intent
to
keep
iowa
out
of
the
union
so
that
her
two
senators
shall
not
ensure
the
vote
of
the
united
states
senate
to
polk
at
the
next
session
but
the
whigs
were
not
altogether
alone
in
their
opposition
to
the
proposed
constitution
not
even
during
the
early
weeks
of
the
campaign
there
was
some
disaffection
among
the
democrats
themselves
that
is
among
the
radicals
who
thought
that
the
new
code
was
not
sufficiently
jeffersonian
the
editor
of
the
for
example
was
severe
in
his
criticisms
but
he
intimated
that
he
would
vote
for
the
constitution
in
the
interests
of
party
discipline
the
on
the
other
hand
although
a
strong
organ
of
the
democracy
emphatically
declared
through
its
editorial
columns
that
admission
under
the
constitution
would
be
a
curse
to
us
as
a
people
as
a
party
however
the
democrats
favored
the
constitution
of
defended
its
provisions
and
urged
its
adoption
by
the
people
they
held
that
as
a
code
of
fundamental
law
it
was
all
that
could
be
expected
or
desired
and
with
a
zeal
that
equaled
in
every
way
the
partisan
efforts
of
the
whigs
they
labored
for
its
ratification
at
the
polls
an
examination
of
the
arguments
as
set
forth
in
the
territorial
press
reveals
two
classes
of
citizens
who
opposed
ratification
first
there
were
those
who
were
hostile
to
the
constitution
because
they
did
not
want
state
government
secondly
there
were
others
who
could
not
subscribe
to
the
provisions
and
principles
of
the
instrument
itself
the
opponents
of
state
government
continued
to
reiterate
the
old
argument
of
economy
they
would
vote
against
the
constitution
in
order
to
prevent
an
increase
in
the
burdens
of
taxation
this
argument
of
itself
could
not
possibly
have
defeated
ratification
since
there
was
at
this
time
an
overwhelming
majority
who
desired
admission
into
the
union
and
yet
the
plea
of
economy
which
always
appealed
strongly
to
the
pioneers
undoubtedly
contributed
somewhat
to
the
defeat
and
rejection
of
the
constitution
of
prior
to
the
first
of
march
opposition
to
ratification
was
expressed
chiefly
in
objections
to
the
proposed
constitution
as
a
whole
that
instrument
was
characterized
as
deficient
in
style
manner
and
matter
and
far
behind
the
spirit
of
this
enlightened
age
it
could
not
even
be
called
a
code
of
fundamental
law
since
it
contained
legislative
as
well
as
constitutional
provisions
it
confounded
statute
law
with
constitutional
law
in
its
detailed
provisions
and
clauses
the
constitution
of
was
still
less
satisfactory
to
the
opponents
of
ratification
they
seemed
to
see
everywhere
running
through
the
whole
instrument
erroneous
principles
inexpedient
provisions
and
confused
inconsistent
and
bungling
language
they
declared
that
the
legislative
executive
and
judicial
departments
of
the
government
were
not
sufficiently
separate
and
distinct
the
principle
of
the
separation
of
powers
was
clearly
violated
by
giving
to
the
executive
the
power
of
veto
and
by
allowing
the
lieutenant
governor
to
participate
in
the
debates
of
the
senate
nor
were
the
popular
powers
namely
the
powers
of
sovereignty
always
differentiated
from
the
delegated
powers
or
the
powers
of
government
the
constitution
was
roundly
abused
because
it
provided
for
the
election
of
the
judges
of
the
inferior
courts
by
the
people
to
the
minds
of
the
critics
the
office
of
judge
was
too
sacred
to
be
dragged
into
partisan
politics
and
through
corrupting
campaigns
judges
ought
not
to
be
responsible
to
the
people
but
solely
to
their
own
consciences
and
to
god
likewise
it
was
contrary
to
the
principles
of
efficient
and
harmonious
administration
to
provide
for
the
popular
election
of
the
secretary
of
state
auditor
of
public
accounts
and
treasurer
such
positions
should
be
filled
by
executive
appointment
again
the
constitution
was
attacked
because
it
provided
for
biennial
instead
of
annual
elections
the
salaries
fixed
for
state
officers
were
niggardly
and
insufficient
the
method
prescribed
for
amending
the
constitution
was
altogether
too
tedious
and
too
uncertain
the
provisions
relative
to
corporations
were
too
narrow
since
they
restrained
the
general
assembly
from
providing
for
internal
improvements
by
requiring
all
charters
of
banks
and
banking
institutions
to
be
submitted
to
a
direct
vote
of
the
people
the
constitution
practically
prevented
the
organization
and
establishment
of
such
institutions
finally
objections
were
made
to
that
section
of
the
bill
of
rights
which
provided
that
no
evidence
in
any
court
of
law
or
equity
should
be
excluded
in
consequence
of
the
religious
opinions
of
the
witness
to
some
it
was
horrifying
to
think
of
admitting
the
testimony
of
and
atheists
such
were
the
arguments
against
ratification
which
were
advanced
by
the
opponents
of
the
constitution
of
however
that
instrument
was
not
so
defective
as
pictured
since
back
of
all
objections
and
all
opposition
was
the
mainspring
of
partisan
politics
the
whigs
were
bent
on
frustrating
the
program
of
the
democrats
were
they
able
to
defeat
the
constitution
on
the
issue
of
its
imperfections
no
not
even
with
the
assistance
of
the
radical
democrats
but
fortunately
for
the
cause
of
the
opposition
a
new
and
powerful
objection
to
ratification
appeared
in
the
closing
weeks
of
the
campaign
the
news
that
congress
had
by
the
act
of
march
rejected
the
boundaries
prescribed
by
the
iowa
convention
reached
the
territory
just
in
time
to
determine
the
fate
of
the
constitution
of
a
close
examination
of
this
act
of
congress
revealed
the
fact
that
the
fourth
section
thereof
conditioned
the
admission
of
iowa
upon
the
acceptance
of
the
by
a
majority
of
the
qualified
electors
at
their
township
elections
in
the
manner
and
at
the
time
prescribed
in
the
sixth
section
of
the
thirteenth
article
of
the
constitution
adopted
at
iowa
city
the
first
day
of
november
anno
domini
eighteen
hundred
and
or
by
the
legislature
of
said
state
moreover
it
was
found
that
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
of
just
quoted
read
as
follows
this
constitution
together
with
whatever
conditions
may
be
made
to
the
same
by
congress
shall
be
ratified
or
rejected
by
a
vote
of
the
qualified
electors
of
this
territory
at
the
township
elections
in
april
next
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
the
act
of
the
legislative
assembly
providing
for
the
holding
of
this
convention
that
the
general
assembly
of
this
state
may
ratify
or
reject
any
conditions
congress
may
make
to
this
constitution
after
the
first
monday
of
april
next
in
the
light
of
these
provisions
it
appeared
to
the
people
of
iowa
that
a
vote
cast
for
the
constitution
would
be
a
vote
for
the
constitution
as
modified
by
the
act
of
congress
this
view
was
altogether
plausible
since
no
provision
had
been
made
for
a
separate
ballot
on
the
conditions
imposed
by
congress
and
so
it
was
thought
that
a
ratification
of
the
constitution
would
carry
with
it
an
acceptance
of
the
while
a
rejection
of
the
constitution
would
imply
a
decided
stand
in
favor
of
the
those
who
during
the
fall
and
winter
had
opposed
ratification
now
renewed
their
opposition
with
augmented
zeal
the
whigs
turned
from
their
petty
attacks
upon
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
to
denounce
the
conditions
imposed
by
congress
they
declared
that
the
constitution
must
be
defeated
in
order
to
reject
the
undesirable
the
boundary
question
now
led
a
considerable
number
of
the
more
moderate
democrats
to
oppose
ratification
prominent
leaders
of
the
party
took
the
stump
and
declared
that
it
would
be
better
to
reject
the
constitution
altogether
than
to
accept
the
limited
boundaries
proposed
by
congress
they
declared
that
the
natural
boundaries
as
prescribed
by
the
constitution
should
not
be
curtailed
and
called
upon
all
good
democrats
to
vote
down
their
own
constitution
many
however
continued
to
support
ratification
believing
that
the
boundaries
imposed
by
the
act
of
congress
were
the
best
that
could
be
obtained
under
the
existing
conditions

the
iowa
delegate
in
congress
took
this
stand
when
the
constitution
of
was
before
congress
mr
dodge
had
stood
firmly
for
the
boundaries
as
proposed
in
that
instrument
but
on
the
day
after
the
act
of
march
had
been
signed
by
the
president
he
addressed
a
letter
to
his
constituents
in
iowa
advising
them
to
ratify
the
constitution
and
accept
the
as
prescribed
by
congress
mr
dodge
thought
that
the
state
would
still
be
large
enough
he
knew
that
the
country
along
the
missouri
river
was
fertile
but
the
dividing
ridge
of
the
waters
running
into
the
mississippi
and
missouri
rivers
called
the
of
the
prairie
and
which
has
been
excluded
from
our
new
state
is
barren
and
sterile
he
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
boundaries
prescribed
by
congress
were
those
suggested
by
nicollet
a
united
states
geologist
who
had
accurately
and
scientifically
examined
the
whole
country
lying
between
the
mississippi
and
missouri
rivers
then
he
pointed
out
the
influences
which
operated
in
reducing
the
boundaries
and
concluded
by
saying
forming
my
opinion
from
extensive
inquiry
and
observation
i
must
in
all
candor
inform
you
that
whatever
your
decision
on
the
first
monday
in
april
next
may
be
we
will
not
be
able
hereafter
under
any
circumstances
to
obtain
square
mile
for
our
new
state
than
is
contained
within
the
boundaries
adopted
by
the
act
of
congress
admitting
iowa
into
the
union
from
the
returns
of
the
election
it
was
evident
that
mr
constituents
either
did
not
take
him
seriously
or
were
sure
that
he
was
mistaken
in
his
conclusions
the
constitution
of
was
rejected
by
a
majority
of
votes
the
result
of
the
election
was
such
as
to
astound
the
friends
of
the
constitution
and
to
surprise
everybody
both
friend
and
foe
those
who
had
labored
for
ratification
throughout
the
campaign
abused
the
whigs
for
opposing
so
perfect
an
instrument
censured
the
convention
for
submitting
the
constitution
to
congress
before
it
had
been
ratified
by
the
people
and
preferred
general
charges
of
misrepresentation
the
friends
of
the
constitution
clamored
loudly
for
a
resubmission
of
the
code
of
fundamental
law
as
it
had
come
from
the
convention
so
that
the
people
might
have
an
opportunity
to
pass
upon
it
free
from
conditions
and
without
misrepresentation
within
a
few
weeks
the
seventh
legislative
assembly
of
the
territory
was
to
meet
in
regular
session
the
members
would
be
asked
to
give
the
constitution
of
another
chance
xiv
the
constitution
of
rejected
a
second
time
on
monday
the
fifth
day
of
may
the
legislative
assembly
of
the
territory
met
in
regular
session
three
days
later
a
message
from
governor
chambers
was
presented
and
read
to
the
members
whereby
they
were
informed
that
the
vote
in
april
had
certainly
resulted
in
the
rejection
of
the
constitution
and
continued
the
governor
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
boundary
offered
us
by
congress
had
much
influence
in
producing
that
result
believing
that
the
rejection
of
the
constitution
by
the
people
called
for
some
action
on
the
part
of
the
assembly
governor
chambers
proposed
and
recommended
that
the
question
be
again
submitted
to
the
people
whether
or
not
they
will
at
this
time
have
a
convention
but
a
majority
of
the
assembly
were
in
favor
of
the
constitution
of
as
it
had
come
from
the
hands
of
the
convention
a
bill
to
was
accordingly
introduced
and
hurried
through
to
its
final
passage
a
formal
and
solemn
protest
from
the
minority
signed
by
nine
members
and
entered
on
the
journal
of
the
house
of
representatives
set
forth
the
leading
objections
to
the
assembly
had
no
delegated
power
to
pass
such
a
measure
the
act
was
designed
to
control
rather
than
ascertain
public
sentiment
the
constitution
of
had
been
rejected
by
the
people
no
memorial
indicating
a
change
of
opinion
had
been
sent
up
by
the
people
since
the
election
in
the
april
election
the
people
had
not
been
misled
they
voted
intelligently
and
their
ballots
were
cast
against
the
constitution
itself
the
conditions
imposed
by
congress
doubtless
had
influence
in
different
sections
of
the
territory
both
for
and
against
it
what
was
lost
on
the
north
and
south
by
the
change
was
practically
made
up
by
the
vote
of
the
center
where
the
congressional
boundaries
are
more
acceptable
than
those
defined
in
the
constitution
the
question
of
territory
being
a
minor
consideration
the
constitution
was
rejected
principally
on
account
of
its
inherent
defects
under
no
consideration
should
the
constitution
of
be
again
submitted
to
the
people
since
it
embodied
so
many
objectionable
provisions
although
the
bill
for
had
passed
both
branches
of
the
assembly
by
a
safe
majority
governor
chambers
did
not
hesitate
to
withhold
his
assent
on
june
he
returned
it
to
the
council
but
it
is
difficult
to
ascertain
the
precise
grounds
upon
which
the
governor
withheld
his
approval
since
his
message
deals
with
conditions
rather
than
objections
in
the
first
place
he
reviewed
the
conditions
under
which
the
constitution
of
had
at
the
same
time
been
submitted
to
congress
and
to
the
people
of
the
territory
then
he
pointed
out
that
whereas
a
poll
was
taken
on
the
constitution
according
to
law
no
provision
had
been
made
for
a
separate
poll
on
the
conditions
imposed
by
congress
this
he
thought
produced
such
confusion
in
the
public
mind
as
to
cause
the
defeat
of
the
constitution
to
be
sure
he
had
proposed
and
was
still
in
favor
of
submitting
the
question
of
a
convention
to
the
people
but
he
would
not
now
insist
on
such
a
policy
he
freely
admitted
that
the
legislative
assembly
had
the
power
to
pass
the
measure
before
him
at
the
same
time
it
seemed
to
him
that
should
the
constitution
of
be
to
the
people
it
would
simply
give
rise
to
confusion
in
attempts
to
reconcile
and
harmonize
the
various
provisions
of
the
statutes
of
the
territory
the
act
of
congress
and
the
constitution
in
the
face
of
the
governor
veto
the
bill
to
the
constitution
passed
both
branches
of
the
assembly
by
the
requisite
majority
and
on
june
was
declared
by
the
secretary
of
the
territory
to
be
a
law
it
provided
that
the
constitution
as
it
came
from
the
hands
of
the
late
convention
be
once
more
submitted
to
the
people
for
their
ratification
or
rejection
it
directed
that
a
poll
be
opened
for
that
purpose
at
the
general
election
to
be
held
on
the
first
monday
of
august
the
votes
of
the
electors
were
to
be
given
furthermore
it
was
expressly
provided
that
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
shall
not
be
construed
as
an
acceptance
of
the
boundaries
fixed
by
congress
in
the
late
act
of
admission
and
the
admission
shall
not
be
deemed
complete
until
whatever
condition
may
be
imposed
by
congress
shall
be
ratified
by
the
people
thus
the
people
were
again
asked
to
pass
upon
the
constitution
of
the
campaign
of
the
summer
of
was
very
much
like
the
campaign
of
the
spring
all
of
the
leading
arguments
both
for
and
against
the
constitution
were
repeated
in
the
press
and
on
the
stump
the
parties
divided
on
the
same
lines
as
before
except
that
the
whigs
in
their
opposition
had
the
assistance
of
a
much
larger
democratic
contingent
one
is
surprised
to
find
in
connection
with
the
boundary
question
little
or
no
mention
of
slavery
the
balance
of
power
or
the
small
state
policy
indeed
the
people
of
iowa
seemed
wholly
indifferent
to
these
larger
problems
of
national
politics
it
is
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
fact
in
the
fascinating
history
of
the
constitution
of
that
in
the
dispute
over
boundaries
the
parties
did
not
join
issue
on
common
grounds
congress
on
the
one
hand
desired
to
curtail
the
boundaries
of
iowa
for
the
purpose
of
creating
a
greater
number
of
northern
states
to
balance
the
slave
states
of
the
south
whereas
the
people
of
iowa
protested
against
such
curtailment
not
because
of
any
considerations
but
simply
because
they
wanted
a
large
state
which
would
embrace
the
fertile
regions
of
the
missouri
on
the
west
and
of
the
peters
on
the
north
augustus
dodge
naturally
received
a
good
deal
of
criticism
and
abuse
about
this
time
on
account
of
his
march
letter
advising
the
acceptance
of
the
boundaries
proposed
by
congress
by
the
whigs
he
was
set
down
as
a
deserter
of
the
people
cause
even
the
legislative
assembly
which
was
democratic
resolved
that
the
delegate
in
congress
be
instructed
to
insist
unconditionally
on
the
convention
boundaries
and
in
no
case
to
accept
anything
short
of
the
peters
on
the
north
and
the
missouri
on
the
west
as
the
northern
and
western
limits
of
the
future
state
of
iowa
mr
dodge
was
not
the
man
to
oppose
the
known
wishes
of
his
constituents
and
so
after
june
he
was
found
earnestly
advocating
the
larger
boundaries
one
of
the
most
interesting
phases
of
the
campaign
was
a
surprising
revelation
in
regard
to
the
attitude
and
ambitions
of
the
people
living
in
the
northern
part
of
the
territory
particularly
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
and
county
of
dubuque
in
the
people
of
this
region
had
been
in
favor
of
extending
the
boundary
as
far
north
as
the
peters
and
in
the
constitutional
convention
of
that
year
langworthy
of
dubuque
had
gone
so
far
as
to
advocate
the
parallel
of
latitude
as
a
line
of
division
but
on
april
the
declared
that
a
proposition
had
gone
out
from
dubuque
to
divide
the
territory
on
the
north
by
a
line
running
due
west
from
the
mississippi
between
the
counties
of
jackson
and
clinton
and
townships
and
later
it
was
said
that
the
was
altogether
serious
in
reference
to
this
proposed
division
these
charges
were
not
without
foundation
for
the
records
of
congress
show
that
in
may
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
presented
a
memorial
of
the
citizens
of
the
territory
of
iowa
north
of
the
degree
of
north
latitude
praying
for
the
establishment
of
a
new
territorial
government
extending
from
the
mississippi
river
between
the
parallel
of
degrees
and
the
northern
boundary
line
of
the
united
states
also
a
memorial
of
thomas
mcknight
and
others
citizens
of
dubuque
county
in
said
territory
of
like
import
the
official
returns
of
the
august
election
showed
that
the
constitution
of
had
been
rejected
a
second
time
but
the
majority
against
its
ratification
had
been
cut
down
by
at
least
one
half
angry
with
disappointment
the
editor
of
the
capital
declared
that
its
defeat
was
due
to
the
pertinacious
and
wilful
misrepresentation
of
the
whig
press
relative
to
the
boundaries
xv
the
convention
of
when
the
members
of
the
eighth
legislative
assembly
of
the
territory
of
iowa
met
in
the
capitol
on
the
first
monday
of
december
they
found
that
as
a
result
of
the
rejection
of
the
constitution
of
they
were
face
to
face
with
the
question
which
for
six
years
had
confronted
the
pioneer
of
iowa
as
the
greatest
political
issue
of
the
territorial
period
they
found
that
the
whole
problem
of
state
organization
was
before
them
for
reconsideration
it
was
found
also
that
politics
had
worked
some
changes
in
the
government
of
the
territory
john
chambers
who
upon
the
completion
of
his
first
term
as
governor
had
been
promptly
reappointed
in
by
president
tyler
was
as
cheerfully
removed
by
president
polk
in
and
the
democracy
of
iowa
rejoiced
over
this
manifestation
of
jacksonianism
they
believed
that
they
would
now
have
a
governor
after
their
own
heart
a
democrat
who
would
have
confidence
in
the
people
and
respect
the
acts
of
their
representatives
to
be
sure
the
first
governor
of
the
territory
of
iowa
was
a
democrat
but
robert
lucas
had
been
altogether
too
independent
he
had
presumed
to
point
out
and
correct
the
errors
and
blunders
of
the
assembly
whereas
a
true
democratic
governor
was
one
who
did
not
lead
but
always
followed
the
wisdom
of
the
masses
james
clarke
the
new
governor
was
a
citizen
of
burlington
and
editor
of
the
during
his
residence
in
the
territory
he
had
always
taken
an
active
part
in
politics
in
he
served
as
a
delegate
in
the
constitutional
convention
before
this
he
had
acted
as
territorial
librarian
and
for
a
short
time
he
filled
the
office
of
secretary
of
the
territory
governor
clarke
regretted
the
fate
of
the
constitution
which
he
had
helped
to
frame
in
his
message
of
december
he
said
since
your
adjournment
in
june
last
a
most
important
question
has
been
decided
by
the
people
the
effect
of
which
is
to
throw
us
back
where
we
originally
commenced
in
our
efforts
to
effect
a
change
in
the
form
of
government
under
which
we
at
present
i
allude
to
the
rejection
of
the
constitution
at
the
august
election
this
result
however
brought
about
in
my
judgment
is
one
greatly
to
be
that
misrepresentation
and
mystification
had
much
to
do
in
effecting
it
there
can
be
no
doubt
still
it
stands
as
the
recorded
judgment
of
the
people
and
to
that
judgment
until
the
people
themselves
reverse
the
decree
it
is
our
duty
to
submit
as
to
recommendations
in
reference
to
this
problem
the
governor
was
cautious
he
favored
state
organization
because
he
thought
that
the
prosperity
of
iowa
would
be
greatly
advanced
by
her
speedy
incorporation
into
the
union
as
a
state
but
he
did
not
presume
to
recommend
a
particular
course
of
action
he
simply
assured
the
assembly
of
his
hearty
in
any
measure
which
might
be
enacted
looking
toward
the
accomplishment
of
the
desired
end
that
is
the
early
admission
of
iowa
into
the
union
confident
that
the
people
of
iowa
really
desired
state
organization
and
were
anxious
for
its
immediate
establishment
the
legislative
assembly
passed
a
bill
providing
for
the
election
of
delegates
to
a
constitutional
convention
this
act
which
was
approved
january
called
for
the
election
by
the
people
of
delegates
at
the
township
elections
in
april
the
delegates
were
directed
to
meet
at
iowa
city
on
the
first
monday
of
may
and
proceed
to
form
a
constitution
and
state
government
for
the
future
state
of
iowa
when
completed
the
draft
of
the
code
of
fundamental
law
was
to
be
submitted
to
the
people
for
ratification
or
rejection
at
the
first
general
election
thereafter
if
ratified
by
the
people
it
was
then
to
be
submitted
to
congress
with
the
request
that
iowa
be
admitted
into
the
union
upon
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states
thus
the
legislative
assembly
forestalled
the
possibility
of
a
repetition
of
the
blunder
of
submitting
to
congress
a
constitution
before
it
had
been
passed
upon
by
the
people
there
was
no
serious
opposition
to
the
course
outlined
by
the
assembly
for
a
large
majority
of
the
people
were
now
anxious
to
see
the
matter
of
state
organization
carried
to
a
successful
conclusion
owing
to
the
absence
of
vital
issues
the
canvass
preceding
the
election
of
delegates
was
not
what
would
be
called
an
enthusiastic
campaign
there
was
of
course
a
party
struggle
between
the
whigs
and
the
democrats
for
the
seats
in
the
convention
but
the
whigs
aware
of
their
hopeless
minority
advocated
a
election
they
clamored
for
a
constitution
one
free
from
party
principles
for
they
did
not
want
to
see
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
iowa
made
the
reservoir
of
party
creeds
they
contended
therefore
that
the
delegates
to
the
convention
should
be
chosen
without
reference
to
party
affiliations
the
democrats
however
were
not
misled
by
the
seductive
cry
of
the
whigs
they
proceeded
to
capture
as
many
seats
as
possible
everywhere
they
instructed
their
candidates
to
vote
against
banks
when
the
returns
were
all
in
it
was
found
that
they
had
elected
more
than
of
the
whole
number
of
delegates
of
the
delegates
who
were
elected
to
seats
in
the
convention
of
ten
were
whigs
and
were
democrats
fifteen
of
the
members
were
born
in
the
south
eight
in
the
new
england
states
four
in
the
middle
states
and
five
in
ohio
of
those
born
in
the
south
six
were
from
kentucky
four
from
virginia
three
from
north
carolina
one
from
alabama
and
one
from
maryland
the
eight
members
born
in
new
england
were
four
from
vermont
and
four
from
connecticut
the

four

and

it
was
on
the
morning
of
may
that
the
second
constitutional
convention
met
in
the
rooms
of
the
old
stone
capitol
at
iowa
city
thirty
names
were
entered

who
had
served
in
the
first
convention
called
the
members
to
order
william

not
a

was
appointed

such
was
the
temporary
organization
it
lasted
but
a
few
minutes
for
immediately
after
the
roll
had
been
called
enos
lowe
of
des
moines
county
was
chosen

of
the

thompson

retained
as

as
the
at
this
point
the
rev
smith
invoked
a
blessing
from
the
deity
upon
the
future
labors
of
the
convention
this
was
the
only
prayer
offered
during
the
entire
session
some
time
was
saved
by
the
immediate
adoption
of
the
rules
of
the
convention
of
in
the
afternoon
it
was
agreed
to
have
six
regular
standing
committees
these
were
on
boundaries
and
bill
of
rights
on
executive
department
on
legislative
department
suffrage
citizenship
education
and
school
lands
on
judicial
department
on
incorporations
internal
improvements
and
state
debts
and
on
schedule
it
is
unfortunate
that
only
the
barest
fragments
have
been
preserved
of
what
was
said
in
the
convention
of
the
official
journal
and
a
few
speeches
are
all
that
have
come
down
to
us
the
debates
could
not
have
been
very
long
however
since
the
entire
session
of
the
convention
did
not
cover
more
than
fifteen
days
the
discussion
for
the
most
part
was
confined
to
those
subjects
upon
which
there
had
been
a
marked
difference
of
opinion
in
the
earlier
convention
or
which
had
received
attention
in
the
campaigns
of
indeed
the
fact
that
boundaries
incorporations
banks
salaries
suffrage
executive
veto
elective
judiciary
and
individual
rights
were
among
the
important
topics
of
debate
is
evidence
of
a
desire
on
the
part
of
the
convention
to
formulate
a
code
of
fundamental
law
that
would
not
meet
with
the
criticisms
which
were
so
lavishly
heaped
upon
the
constitution
of
the
convention
of
was
certainly
in
earnest
in
its
desire
to
draft
a
constitution
which
would
be
approved
by
the
people
enos
lowe
the
president
had
at
the
outset
informed
the
members
that
they
were
elected
to
form
a
constitution
but
the
attitude
of
the
convention
is
nowhere
better
expressed
than
in
the
following
action
which
was
taken
on
the
eleventh
day
of
may
whereas
in
the
opinion
of
this
convention
it
is
all
important
that
the
constitution
formed
here
at
this
time
be
so
framed
as
to
meet
with
the
approbation
of
a
majority
of
the
electors
of
this
territory
therefore
that
a
committee
of
three
be
added
to
the
supervisory
committee
whose
duty
shall
be
to
enquire
into
the
sectional
feelings
on
the
different
parts
of
a
constitution
and
to
report
such
alterations
as
to
them
appears
most
likely
to
obviate
the
various
objections
that
may
operate
against
the
adoption
of
this
constitution
by
the
nineteenth
of
may
the
convention
of
had
completed
its
labors
in
comparison
with
the
convention
of
its
history
may
be
summed
up
in
the
one
word
economy
the
convention
of
contained
members
that
of
the
former
continued
in
session
fifteen
days
the
latter
days
the
expenditures
of
the
second
convention
did
not
exceed
while
the
total
cost
of
the
first
convention
was
here
then
was
economy
in
men
economy
in
time
and
economy
in
expenditures
the
thrifty
pioneers
were
proud
of
the
record
xvi
the
constitution
of
the
constitution
of
was
modeled
upon
the
constitution
of
although
it
was
by
no
means
a
servile
copy
of
that
twice
rejected
instrument
both
codes
were
drawn
up
according
to
the
same
general
plan
and
were
composed
of
the
same
number
of
articles
dealing
substantially
with
the
same
subjects
the
constitution
of
however
was
not
so
long
as
the
constitution
of
and
was
throughout
more
carefully
edited
article
on
preamble
and
boundaries
does
not
contain
the
quotation
from
the
preamble
of
the
federal
constitution
which
was
made
a
part
of
the
corresponding
article
in
the
constitution
of
as
to
boundary
specifications
the
only
material
difference
is
found
in
the
shifting
of
the
line
on
the
north
from
the
peters
to
the
parallel
of
and
one
half
degrees
of
north
latitude
this
new
boundary
was
a
compromise
between
the
boundaries
suggested
by
lucas
and
those
proposed
by
nicollet
the
bill
of
rights
which
constitutes
article
contained
one
additional
section
which
aimed
to
disqualify
all
citizens
who
should
participate
in
dueling
from
holding
any
office
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
state
article
iii
on
the
right
of
suffrage
reads
the
same
as
in
the
constitution
of
although
in
the
convention
of
a
strong
effort
had
been
made
to
extend
this
political
right
to
resident
foreigners
who
had
declared
their
intention
of
becoming
citizens
article
iv
on
the
composition
organization
and
powers
of
the
general
assembly
contained
four
items
which
differed
materially
from
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
of
first
it
was
provided
that
the
sessions
of
the
general
assembly
should
commence
on
the
first
monday
of
january
instead
of
on
the
first
monday
of
december
secondly
the
senate
was
to
choose
its
own
presiding
officer
thirdly
all
bills
for
revenue
must
originate
in
the
house
of
representatives
fourthly
the
salaries
for
ten
years
were
fixed
as
follows
for
governor
for
secretary
of
state
for
treasurer
for
auditor
and
for
judges
of
the
supreme
court
and
district
courts
article
on
executive
department
differs
from
the
corresponding
article
in
the
constitution
of
in
that
the
office
of
lieutenant
governor
is
omitted
while
the
term
of
the
governor
is
made
four
years
instead
of
two
article
which
provides
for
the
judiciary
limits
the
term
of
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
and
district
courts
to
four
years
articles
vii
and
viii
on
militia
and
state
debts
respectively
are
the
same
as
in
the
earlier
constitution
article
ix
on
incorporations
is
a
radical
departure
from
the
provisions
of
the
old
constitution
the
general
assembly
is
empowered
to
provide
general
laws
with
reference
to
corporations
but
is
restrained
from
creating
such
institutions
by
special
laws
at
the
same
time
the
article
provides
that
no
corporate
body
shall
hereafter
be
created
renewed
or
extended
with
the
privilege
of
making
issuing
or
putting
in
circulation
any

promissory
note
or
other
paper

this
state
shall
prohibit
by
law
any
person
or
persons
association
company
or
corporation
from
exercising
the
privileges
of
banking
or
creating
paper
to
circulate
as
money
article
on
education
and
school
lands
directs
the
general
assembly
to
provide
for
the
election
by
the
people
of
a
superintendent
of
public
instruction
and
to
encourage
by
all
suitable
means
the
promotion
of
intellectual
scientific
moral
and
agricultural
improvement
article
xi
on
amendments
of
the
constitution
provided
but
one
method
of
effecting
changes
in
the
fundamental
law
the
general
assembly
was
empowered
to
provide
at
any
time
for
a
vote
of
the
people
on
the
question
of
a
convention
to
revise
or
amend
this
constitution
if
a
majority
of
the
people
favored
a
convention
then
the
general
assembly
was
to
provide
for
the
election
of
delegates
article
xii
contains
three
miscellaneous
items
relative
to
the
jurisdiction
of
justices
of
the
peace
the
size
of
new
counties
and
the
location
of
lands
granted
to
the
state
article
xiii
on
schedule
provided
among
other
things
that
the
governor
should
by
proclamation
appoint
the
time
for
holding
the
first
general
election
under
the
constitution
but
such
election
must
be
held
within
three
months
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
likewise
the
governor
was
empowered
to
fix
the
day
of
the
first
meeting
of
the
general
assembly
of
the
state
which
day
however
must
be
within
four
months
of
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
by
the
people
it
is
moreover
interesting
to
note
that
while
the
constitution
of
prescribed
in
general
outline
a
system
of
county
and
township
government
the
constitution
of
left
the
whole
matter
of
local
government
to
future
legislation
xvii
the
new
boundaries
while
the
people
of
the
territory
of
iowa
were
preparing
for
and
holding
a
second
constitutional
convention
and
while
they
were
debating
the
provisions
of
the
new
constitution
of
congress
was
reconsidering
the
boundaries
of
the
proposed
state
the
matter
had
been
called
up
early
in
the
session
by
the
iowa
delegate
mr
dodge
having
been
returned
to
washington
with
the
determination
of
carrying
out
his
instructions
so
far
as
the
boundary
question
was
concerned
and
so
on
december
he
asked
leave
to
introduce
a
bill
to
define
the
boundaries
of
the
state
of
iowa
and
to
repeal
so
much
of
the
act
of
the
of
march
as
relates
to
the
boundaries
of
iowa
the
original
copy
of
this
bill
which
has
been
preserved
in
the
office
of
the
clerk
of
the
house
of
representatives
bears
testimony
to
mr
dodge
fidelity
to
promises
made
to
the
people
for
the
description
of
boundaries
therein
is
a
clipping
from
the
preamble
of
the
printed
pamphlet
edition
of
the
constitution
of
in
discussing
the
question
later
in
the
session
he
referred
to
his
pledges
as
follows
i
know
chairman
what
are
the
wishes
and
sentiments
of
the
people
of
iowa
upon
this
subject
it
is
but
lately
sir
that
i
have
undergone
the
popular
ordeal
upon
this
question
and
i
tell
you
in
all
candor
and
sincerity
that
i
would
not
be
in
this
hall
if
i
had
not
made
them
the
most
solemn
assurances
that
all
my
energies
and
whatever
influence
i
possessed
would
be
exerted
to
procure
for
them
the
thousand
square
miles
included
within
the
limits
designated
in
their
original
constitution
it
was
in
conformity
with
pledges
that
i
had
given
them
personally
with
instructions
which
i
knew
i
had
received
from
them
at
the
that
i
introduced
at
an
early
day
of
the
present
session
the
bill
imbodying
the
boundaries
of
their
choice
it
was
not
however
until
march
that
stephen
douglas
from
the
committee
on
the
territories
to
whom
mr
bill
had
been
referred
reported
an
amendatory
bill
this
bill
which
was
introduced
to
take
the
place
of
the
original
bill
rejected
the
boundaries
of
the
constitution
of
and
proposed
the
parallel
of
degrees
and
thirty
minutes
as
the
northern
boundary
line
of
the
new
state
it
was
committed
to
the
committee
of
the
whole
house
on
the
state
of
the
union
wherein
it
was
discussed
on
the
eighth
of
june
and
reported
back
to
the
house
on
the
ninth
of
june
the
amendatory
bill
was
taken
up
by
the
house
and
passed
it
was
reported
to
the
senate
without
delay
but
was
not
passed
by
that
body
until
the
first
day
of
august
on
the
fourth
day
of
august
the
act
received
the
approval
of
president
polk
the
most
important
discussion
of
the
bill
was
in
the
house
of
representatives
on
the
eighth
day
of
june
an
attempt
was
made
to
reduce
the
state
on
the
north
rockwell
of
massachusetts
moved
to
amend
by
striking
out
the
words
and
thirty
minutes
where
they
occur
and
inserting
in
lieu
thereof
degrees
he
understood
from
a
memorial
which
had
been
presented
to
the
house
that
the
people
in
the
northern
part
of
the
territory
did
not
wish
to
be
included
within
the
proposed
boundaries
douglas
said
that
he
was
now
in
favor
of
the
new
boundaries
as
proposed
by
the
committee
on
the
territories
he
declared
that
the
boundaries
of
the
act
of
march
would
be
the
worst
that
could
be
agreed
upon
the
most
unnatural
the
most
inconvenient
for
the
state
itself
and
leaving
the
balance
of
the
territory
in
the
worst
shape
for
the
formation
of
other
new
states
as
to
the
memorial
from
dubuque
recommending
the
parallel
of
degrees
douglas
said
that
he
was
aware
of
the
influences
which
produced
it
the
people
of
dubuque
wished
either
for
such
an
arrangement
as
should
cause
dubuque
to
be
the
largest
town
in
a
little
state
or
else
to
make
it
the
central
town
of
a
large
state
rathburn
of
new
york
was
opposed
to
the
lines
laid
down
in
the
bill
he
favored
less
extensive
boundaries
because
he
desired
to
preserve
the
balance
of
power
in
the
union
by
the
creation
of
small
states
in
the
west
he
was
against
making
empires
he
preferred
that
we
should
have
states
in
this
union
vinton
of
ohio
said
that
in
the
last
session
of
congress
no
question
except
that
of
texas
had
excited
more
interest
in
the
house
he
did
not
think
that
the
people
of
the
territory
should
decide
the
question
of
boundaries
and
he
asserted
that
if
congress
was
willing
to
let
the
people
of
iowa
cut
and
carve
for
themselves
he
did
not
doubt
that
they
would
have
their
state
extend
to
the
mouth
of
the
columbia
the
strongest
speech
perhaps
in
the
whole
debate
was
that
of
the
iowa
delegate
mr
dodge
reviewed
the
history
of
the
boundary
dispute
and
pointed
out
that
both
he
and
the
people
of
iowa
had
pursued
a
firm
and
honorable
course
he
showed
that
many
of
the
states
were
as
large
as
or
even
larger
than
the
proposed
state
of
iowa
referring
to
the
boundary
proposed
in
the
act
of
march
he
said
it
will
never
be
accepted
by
the
people
of
iowa
but
he
produced
letters
to
show
that
the
iowa
convention
of
were
willing
to
accept
the
compromise
boundary
proposed
in
the
bill
under
discussion
thus
sir
it
is
now
apparent
that
if
the
house
will
pass
the
bill
reported
by
the
committee
on
territories
it
will
put
an
end
to
this
question
the
convention
of
iowa
have
met
the
advances
of
the
committee
on
territories
of
this
house
vinton
then
moved
an
amendment
fixing
the
parallel
as
the
northern
boundary
this
was
a
tempting
proposition
but
mr
dodge
stood
firmly
for
the
parallel
of
degrees
thirty
and
closed
his
remarks
with
these
words
i
admonish
the
majority
of
this
house
that
if
the
amendment
of
the
gentleman
from
ohio
is
to
prevail
they
might
as
well
pass
an
act
for
our
perpetual
exclusion
from
the
union
sir
the
people
of
iowa
will
never
acquiesce
in
it
from
the
journal
of
the
iowa
convention
of
it
appears
that
when
the
committee
on
preamble
and
boundaries
made
their
report
on
the
morning
of
the
second
day
of
the
convention
they
recommended
the
compromise
boundaries
which
had
already
been
proposed
by
the
committee
on
the
territories
in
the
national
house
of
representatives
but
when
the
report
was
taken
up
for
consideration
several
days
later
an
amendment
was
offered
which
proposed
to
substitute
the
boundaries
as
described
in
the
constitution
of
on
a
test
ballot
the
vote
of
the
convention
stood
to
eight
in
favor
of
the
amendment
this
was
on
the
eighth
of
may
six
days
later
a
resolution
instructing
the
committee
on
revision
to
amend
the
article
on
boundaries
so
as
to
read
as
follows
was
adopted
by
a
vote
of
eighteen
to
thirteen
beginning
in
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
the
mississippi
river
at
a
point
due
east
of
the
middle
of
the
mouth
of
the
main
channel
of
the
des
moines

thence
up
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
the
said
des
moines
river
to
a
point
on
said
river
where
the
northern
boundary
line
of
the
state
of
missouri
as
established
by
the
constitution
of
that
state
adopted
june
crosses
the
said
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
the
said
des
moines
river
thence
westwardly
along
the
said
northern
boundary
line
of
the
state
of
missouri
as
established
at
the
time
aforesaid
until
an
extension
of
said
line
intersects
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
the
missouri
river
thence
up
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
the
said
missouri
river
to
a
point
opposite
the
middle
of
the
main

thence
down

to
the

of
beginning
these
were
in
substance
the
compromise
boundaries
which
were
first
proposed
in
congress
by
the
committee
on
the
territories
on
march
their
precise
description
however
was
the
work
of
the
iowa
convention
congress
promptly
adopted
this
description
in
the
act
of
august
by
striking
out
the
words
of
the
bill
then
pending
and
inserting
the
language
of
the
iowa
convention
as
used
in
the
preamble
to
their
constitution
xviii
the
admission
of
iowa
into
the
union
when
submitted
to
the
people
the
constitution
of
was
vigorously
opposed
by
the
whigs
who
insisted
that
it
was
a
party
instrument
their
attitude
and
arguments
are
nowhere
better
set
forth
than
in
the
address
of
wm
penn
clarke
to
the
electors
of
the
counties
of
muscatine
johnson
and
iowa
clarke
had
come
to
the
conclusion
after
reading
the
proposed
code
of
fundamental
law
that
its
ratification
would
prove
greatly
detrimental
if
not
entirely
ruinous
to
the
nearest
and
dearest
interests
of
the
people
by
retarding
the
growth
of
the
proposed
state
in
population
commerce
wealth
and
prosperity
this
conviction
led
him
to
oppose
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
of
first
he
objected
to
the
constitution
because
it
entirely
prohibits
the
establishing
of
banking
institutions
institutions
which
are
absolutely
essential
to
the
economic
welfare
and
industrial
development
of
the
state
he
contended
that
this
inhibition
of
banks
is
not
an
inhibition
of
bank
paper
as
a
circulating
medium
the
question
is
narrowed
down
to
the
single
point
we
will
have
banks
of
our
own
and
a
currency
of
our
own
creation
and
under
our
own
or
whether
we
will
become
dependent
on
other
states
for
such
a
circulating
medium
by
prohibiting
the
creation
of
banks
we
but
disable
ourselves
and
a
foreign
currency
for
a
home
currency
the
effect
of
the
article
on
incorporations
will
be
to
make
iowa
the
of
all
banks
in
the
union
secondly
clarke
opposed
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
of
because
of
the
provisions
in
the
eighth
and
ninth
articles
he
maintained
that
the
article
on
state
debts
was
tantamount
to
an
inhibition
of
the
construction
of
internal
improvements
by
the
state
government
while
the
article
on
incorporations
aimed
to
prohibit
the
people
from
making
such
improvements
thirdly
he
protested
against
the
experiment
of
an
elective
judicial
system
since
the
election
of
the
judges
is
calculated
to
disrobe
our
courts
of
justice
of
their
sacred
character
clarke
would
not
deny
the
right
or
the
competency
of
the
people
to
elect
their
judicial
officers
but
he
pointed
out
that
the
effect
would
be
to
place
upon
the
bench
and
to
elevate
to
the
judiciary
second
or
third
rate
men
in
point
of
talents
and
legal
acquirements
fourthly
the
constitution
should
be
rejected
because
it
contains
no
provision
securing
to
the
people
the
right
to
elect
their
township
and
county
officers
furthermore
it
is
entirely
silent
with
reference
to
county
and
township
organization
fifthly
clarke
argued
against
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
because
not
a
single
letter
can
be
stricken
from
it
without
calling
a
convention
he
declared
that
the
democrats
after
incorporating
into
the
constitution
partizan
dogmas
so
formulated
the
article
on
amendments
as
to
make
their
creed
permanent
in
the
closing
paragraphs
of
this
remarkable
arraignment
of
the
proposed
constitution
clarke
referred
to
local
interests
in
connection
with
the
location
of
the
state
capital
iowa
city
he
said
had
been
founded
with
a
view
to
its
being
the
permanent
capital
of
the
state
but
the
new
boundaries
proposed
by
the
committee
on
the
territories
would
if
adopted
threaten
the
permanency
of
the
iowa
city
location
indeed
clarke
went
so
far
as
to
intimate
that
the
relocation
of
the
capital
was
a
part
of
mr
dodge
program
in
connection
with
the
solution
of
the
boundary
problem
curtailing
the
state
on
the
north
and
extending
it
at
the
same
time
to
the
missouri
on
the
west
meant
the
ultimate
shifting
of
the
capital
to
the
raccoon
forks
clarke
concluded
the
prophecy
by
saying
that
to
quiet
the
center
we
shall
probably
be
promised
a
state
university
or
something
of
that
character
and
then
be
cheated
in
the
end
such
were
the
leading
objections
to
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
of
as
urged
by
the
whigs
in
the
press
and
on
the
stump
they
were
supported
by
the
more
conservative
democrats
who
protested
against
the
article
on
incorporations
and
the
article
on
amendments
a
large
majority
of
the
people
however
were
impatient
for
the
establishment
of
state
organization
for
the
time
they
were
even
willing
to
overlook
the
defects
of
the
proposed
constitution
many
voted
for
the
instrument
with
the
hope
of
remedying
its
imperfections
after
admission
into
the
union
had
once
been
effected
the
constitution
of
narrowly
escaped
defeat
at
the
polls
on
august
its
supporters
according
to
the
proclamation
were
able
to
command
a
majority
of
only
four
hundred
and
out
of
a
total
of
eighteen
thousand
five
hundred
and
votes
on
september
governor
clarke
as
directed
by
the
territorial
statute
of
january
issued
a
formal
proclamation
declaring
the
ratification
and
adoption
of
the
constitution
in
the
same
proclamation
and
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
new
constitution
the
governor
designated
monday
the
day
of
october
next
as
the
time
for
holding
the
first
general
election
for
state
officers
the
returns
of
this
election
showed
that
the
democrats
had
succeeded
in
electing
ansel
briggs
their
candidate
for
governor
by
a
majority
of
one
hundred
and
votes
the
same
party
also
captured
a
majority
of
the
seats
in
the
first
general
assembly
following
the
directions
of
the
schedule
in
the
new
constitution
governor
clarke
issued
a
proclamation
on
november

he
named

was
on

the
senators
and
representatives
assembled
together
in
the
hall
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
the
old
stone
capitol
to
witness
the
inauguration
of
the
new

in
the
presence
of
the

charles

chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
territory
administered
the
oath
of
office
to
the
first
governor
of
the
state
of
iowa
twelve
days
after
the
inauguration
of
the
state
governor
at
iowa
city
mr
dodge
presented
to
the
house
of
representatives
at
washington
a
copy
of
the
constitution
of
iowa
the
document
was
at
once
referred
to
the
committee
on
the
territories
from
which
a
bill
for
the
admission
of
iowa
into
the
union
was
reported
through
stephen
douglas
on
december
seventeenth
it
was
made
a
special
order
of
the
day
for
monday
december
when
it
was
debated
and
passed
reported
to
the
senate
on
the
it
was
there
referred
to
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
this
committee
reported
the
bill
back
to
the
senate
without
amendment
after
some
consideration
it
passed
the
senate
on
december
four
days
later
it
received
the
approval
of
president
polk
the
existence
of
iowa
as
one
of
the
commonwealths
of
the
united
states
of
america
dates
therefore
from
the
day
of
december
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
the
act
of
admission
declares
that
iowa
is
admitted
into
the
union
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states
in
all
respects
whatsoever
and
provides
that
all
the
provisions
of
an
act
supplemental
to
the
act
for
the
admission
of
the
states
of
iowa
and
florida
into
the
union
approved
march
shall
continue
in
full
force
as
applicable
to
the
state
of
iowa
the
conditions
contained
in
the
provisions
of
this
act
which
had
been
substituted
by
congress
in
lieu
of
the
provisions
of
the
ordinance
submitted
by
the
convention
of
were
finally
accepted
by
the
general
assembly
of
the
state
in
an
act
approved
january
xix
the
convention
of
throughout
iowa
there
was
a
very
general
feeling
of
satisfaction
with
the
new
political
status
which
came
with
the
establishment
of
state
government
and
admission
into
the
union
having
outlived
the
conditions
of
territorial
government
the
pioneers
of
iowa
now
entered
into
the
new
political
life
without
regret
they
rejoiced
over
the
fact
that
they
were
recognized
as
a
part
of
a
great
nation
they
appreciated
the
significance
of
the
change
nor
were
the
pioneers
of
iowa
strangers
to
national
political
life
as
settlers
on
the
public
domain
they
were
in
a
very
special
sense
children
of
the
nation
they
had
always
cherished
the
inheritances
of
the
fathers
but
now
the
days
of
dependence
were
over
henceforth
this
people
of
the
frontier
would
strengthen
the
whole
country
with
their
own
political
ideas
and
ideals
they
would
indeed
help
to
vitalize
the
politics
of
the
nation
with
the
provincial
spirit
of
western
democracy
on
the
other
hand
the
people
of
iowa
did
not
accept
their
new
state
constitution
without
reservations
wm
penn
clarke
address
had
been
widely
read
and
his
arguments
were
accepted
not
alone
by
the
whigs
in
fact
the
constitution
of
had
not
been
adopted
altogether
on
its
merits
the
people
were
anxious
to
get
into
the
union
and
they
voted
for
the
constitution
as
the
shortest
road
to
admission
they
meant
to
correct
its
errors
afterwards
in
the
editor
of
the
city
asserted
that
the
constitution
of
had
been
accepted
purely
from
motives
of
expediency
and
with
a
tacit
understanding
that
it
was
to
receive
some
slight
amendments
as
soon
as
they
could
constitutionally
and
legally
be
made
and
but
for
this
it
would
have
been
rejected
by
a
very
handsome
majority
no
well
informed
citizen
can
deny
this
and
so
the
constitution
of
had
scarcely
been
ratified
at
the
polls
before
an
agitation
looking
toward
its
amendment
or
revision
was
begun
as
early
as
august
the
city
declared
that
three
fourths
of
the
people
of
iowa
have
determined
that
cost
what
it
may
the
ninth
article
shall
not
remain
unaltered
in
the
constitution
during
the
first
session
of
the
general
assembly
of
the
state
a
bill
providing
for
an
expression
of
the
opinion
of
the
people
of
iowa
upon
the
subject
of
amendment
passed
the
house
of
representatives
but
was
indefinitely
postponed
in
the
senate
by
a
vote
of
ten
to
eight
this
was
in
february
in
the
question
of
constitutional
amendment
was
made
an
issue
in
the
political
campaign
the
whigs
advocated
amendment
or
revision
while
the
democrats
as
a
rule
stood
for
the
constitution
as
ratified
in
a
bill
providing
for
an
expression
of
opinion
by
the
people
was
again
introduced
in
the
house
of
representatives
during
the
second
session
of
the
general
assembly
but
was
indefinitely
postponed
after
the
second
reading
a
similar
bill
was
rejected
by
the
house
during
the
third
session
during
the
fourth
regular
session
petitions
favorable
to
amendment
were
received
from
the
people
in
the
meantime
stephen
hempstead
was
elected
to
the
office
of
governor
he
had
been
opposed
to
the
agitation
for
constitutional
revision
and
in
his
first
message
of
december
he
said
i
can
not
avoid
a
feeling
of
deep
concern
at
the
opinion
expressed
by
some
portion
of
our
fellow
citizens
in
favor
of
amending
the
constitution
of
our
state
in
such
a
manner
as
to
authorize
the
establishment
of
banks
of
special
acts
of
incorporation
for
pecuniary
profit
and
of
contracting
state
debts
without
limitations
of
the
general
assembly
in
the
same
document
he
urged
upon
the
general
assembly
the
propriety
of
passing
a
law
to
prohibit
the
circulation
of
all
bank
notes
of
a
less
denomination
than
ten
dollars
when
he
retired
from
office
in
december
he
still
declared
that
he
saw
no
imperative
reason
why
our
constitution
should
be
amended
but
his
successor
governor
grimes
favored
submitting
the
question
of
revision
and
amendment
to
the
people
the
necessity
for
a
convention
to
revise
the
constitution
of
had
become
imperative
iowa
was
flooded
with
a
depreciated
paper
currency
from
other
states
gold
and
silver
money
was
scarce
the
few
pieces
which
found
their
way
into
the
state
were
hoarded
either
to
pay
taxes
or
to
pay
for
government
land
finally
an
act
providing
for
the
revision
or
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
this
state
was
passed
by
the
fifth
general
assembly
and
approved
by
governor
grimes
january
in
accordance
with
its
provisions
a
poll
was
opened
at
the
general
election
in
august
for
the
purpose
of
taking
a
vote
of
the
people
for
or
against
a
convention
to
revise
or
amend
the
constitution
on
the
tenth
day
of
september
the
governor
declared
in
his
official
proclamation
that
a
majority
of
eighteen
thousand
six
hundred
and
votes
had
been
cast
in
favor
of
a
convention
in
november
delegates
were
elected
to
the
convention
which
met
in
the
supreme
court
room
of
the
old
stone
capitol
at
iowa
city
on
january
gray
of
linn
county
called
the
convention
to
order
and
moved
that
john
parvin
of
muscatine
be
chosen
president
on
the
following
day
francis
springer
was
elected
president
of
the
convention
the
other
permanent
officers
were
as
follows
thomas
saunders
secretary
ellsworth
bates
assistant
secretary
trowbridge
francis
thompson
door
keeper
james
hawkins
messenger
and
blair
lord

of
the
delegates
six
were
from
the
new
england
states
eleven
from
the
middle
states
ten
from
the
south
and
nine
from
the
middle
west
as
to
occupation
there
were
fourteen
lawyers
twelve
farmers
two
merchants
two
dealers
in
real
estate
two
bankers
one
one
mail
contractor
one
druggist
and
one
the
youngest
member
was
the
oldest
while
the
average
age
of
all
the
members
was
forty
years
of
the
members
were
republicans
the
other
fifteen
were
democrats
early
in
the
session
of
the
convention
of
there
appeared
to
be
considerable
dissatisfaction
with
the
accommodations
afforded
at
iowa
city
the
general
assembly
had
not
yet
adjourned
and
so
the
convention
was
compelled
to
meet
for
a
few
days
in
the
supreme
court
room
some
of
the
members
complained
of
the
hotel
service
and
declared
that
they
had
not
been
welcomed
with
proper
courtesy
and
hospitality
by
the
people
of
iowa
city
at
the
same
time
the
convention
received
alluring
invitations
from
davenport
and
dubuque
a
committee
of
five
was
appointed
to
whom
these
invitations
were
referred
the
report
of
this
committee
provoked
a
lively
debate
which
wm
penn
clarke
desired
to
have
suppressed
in
the
published
reports
the
result
of
the
discussion
was
that
the
convention
concluded
to
remain
in
iowa
city
on
the
second
day
the
members
took
an
oath
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
some
desired
to
include
in
this
oath
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
iowa
but
the
majority
did
not
think
it
proper
to
swear
allegiance
to
a
constitution
which
the
convention
was
called
upon
to
amend
revise
or
perhaps
reject
altogether
the
act
of
january
calling
for
the
convention
provided
for
the
revision
or
amendment
of
the
constitution
many
would
have
been
satisfied
with
a
few
amendments
the
convention
however
proceeded
to
draft
a
completely
revised
code
of
fundamental
law
the
two
large
volumes
of
printed
reports
show
that
the
principles
of
constitutional
law
were
discussed
from
preamble
to
schedule
the
most
important
question
before
the
convention
of
was
that
of
corporations
in
general
and
of
banking
corporations
in
particular
the
republican
majority
was
pledged
to
make
provisions
for
a
banking
system
of
some
sort
but
the
popular
mind
had
not
decided
whether
there
should
be
a
state
bank
with
branches
or
a
free
banking
system
under
legislative
restrictions
or
both
difficult
and
intricate
as
the
problem
was
the
iowa
convention
handled
it
nevertheless
with
energy
and
rare
ability
the
debates
show
that
the
laws
and
experience
of
the
other
states
were
carefully
studied
nor
were
local
conditions
and
local
experience
forgotten
the
discussions
were
long
earnest
and
often
heated
but
at
no
time
did
the
iowa

lose
its
political
sanity
that
political
poise
which
in
the
long
run
has
always
characterized

it
was
in
respect
to
these
vital
questions
of
the
hour
that
the
republican
majority
in
the
convention
was
compelled
to
declare
and
defend
its
attitude
the
fact
that
the
republican
party
of
iowa
was
thus
being
put
on
trial
for
the
first
time
makes
the
debates
of
the
convention
of
memorable
in
the
political
annals
of
the
state
but
these
iowa
republicans
were
at
the
same
time
defining
and
defending
the
attitude
of
their
party
on
national
issues
and
so
the
debates
of
the
iowa
convention
are
a
also
in
the
broader
history
of
america
no
one
can
read
the
pages
of
these
debates
without
feeling
that
iowa
was
making
a
decided
contribution
to
national
politics
nearly
four
years
before
the
divided
house
speech
was
delivered
at
springfield
illinois
governor
grimes
had
said
in
his
inaugural
address
it
becomes
the
state
of
iowa
the
only
free
child
of
the
missouri
compromise
to
let
the
world
know
that
she
values
the
blessings
that
compromise
has
secured
her
and
that
she
will
never
consent
to
become
a
party
to
the
nationalization
of
slavery
and
full
two
years
before
lincoln
defined
the
attitude
of
his
party
in
the
debates
it
had
gone
forth
from
the
iowa
convention
that
the
republican
party
was
not
a
sectional
party
that
abolition
was
not
a
part
of
the
republican
creed
and
that
while
they
would
arrest
the
further
extension
of
slavery
republicans
had
no
desire
to
interfere
with
the
institution
in
places
where
it
already
existed
the
question
as
to
whether
the
negro
should
be
allowed
to
vote
in
iowa
was
referred
to
the
people
to
be
decided
by
them
when
the
constitution
itself
was
submitted
for
ratification
another
question
of
interest
which
provoked
considerable
discussion
in
the
convention
was
the
location
of
the
state
university
and
the
of
the
capital
this
problem
had
already
been
solved
by
the
general
assembly
but
to
prevent
further
agitation
by
making
the
compromise
permanent
the
following
section
was
added
to
the
new
constitution
the
seat
of
government
is
hereby
permanently
established
as
now
fixed
by
law
at
the
city
of
des
moines
in
the
county
of
polk
and
the
state
university
at
iowa
city
in
the
county
of
johnson
after
a
session
of
days
the
third
constitutional
convention
in
the
history
of
iowa
adjourned
on
thursday
march
xx
the
constitution
of
the
code
of
fundamental
law
which
was
drafted
by
the
convention
of
was
modeled
upon
the
constitution
of
as
this
instrument
had
previously
been
patterned
after
the
constitution
of
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
say
that
the
constitution
of
was
simply
a
revision
of
the
constitution
of
the
later
document
however
is
fuller
and
altogether
more
complete
and
more
perfect
than
its
precursors
the
changes
which
had
been
effected
in
the
fundamental
law
were
summed
up
by
the
president
of
the
convention
in
his
closing
remarks
as
follows
we
have
added
some
new
and
important
guards
for
the
security
of
popular
rights
and
for
the
promotion
of
the
best
interests
of
the
social
compact
restrictions
existed
in
the
old
constitution
which
it
is
believed
have
operated
to
check
and
retard
the
energies
and
prosperity
of
the
state
these
we
have
removed
we
have
stricken
the
fetters
from
the
limbs
of
the
infant
giant
and
given
free
scope
to
resources

as
we
believe
of
