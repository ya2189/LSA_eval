henry
english
archbishop
founder
of
all

college
oxford
was
born
at
higham
ferrers
northamptonshire
in
or
chicheley
told
the
pope
in
in
asking
leave
to
retire
from
the
archbishopric
that
he
was
in
his
eightieth
year
he
was
the
third
and
youngest
son
of
thomas
chicheley
who
appears
in
in
still
extant
town
records
of
higham
ferrers
as
a
suitor
in
the
mayor
court
and
in
and
again
in
was

in

for
a
dozen
years

and
henry
barton

master
of
higham
ferrers
grammar
school
and
one
richard
brabazon
filled
the
mayoralty
in
turns
his
occupation
does
not
appear
but
his
eldest
son
william
is
on
the
earliest
extant
list
of
the
grocers
company
london
on
the
of
june
chicheley
was
admitted
in
succession
to
his
father
to
a
burgage
in
higham
ferrers
his
mother
agnes
pincheon
is
said
to
have
been
of
gentle
birth
there
is
therefore
no
foundation
in
fact
for
the
silly
story
copied
into
the
nat
from
a
local
historian
cole
wellingborough
that
henry
chicheley
was
picked
up
by
william
of
wykeham
when
he
was
a
poor
ploughboy
eating
his
scanty
meal
off
his
mother
lap
whatever
that
means
the
story
was
unknown
to
arthur
duck
fellow
of
all
souls
who
wrote
chicheley
life
in
it
is
only
the
usual
attempt
as
in
the
cases
of
whittington
wolsey
and
gresham
to
exaggerate
the
rise
of
a
successful
man
the
first
recorded
appearance
of
henry
chicheley
himself
is
at
new
college
oxford
as
checheley
eighth
among
the
undergraduate
fellows
in
july
in
the
earliest
extant
which
contains
weekly
lists
of
those
dining
in
hall
it
is
clear
from
chicheley
position
in
the
list
with
eleven
fellows
and
eight
scholars
or
below
him
that
this
entry
does
not
mark
his
first
appearance
in
the
college
which
had
been
going
on
since
at
least
and
was
chartered
in
he
must
have
come
from
winchester
college
in
one
of
the
earliest
batches
of
scholars
from
that
college
the
sole
feeder
of
new
college
not
from
st
john
baptist
college
winchester
as
guessed
by
dr
william
hunt
in
the
nat
and
repeated
in
mr
grant
robertson
of
all
souls
to
cover
the
mistaken
supposition
that
st
mary
college
was
not
founded
till
st
mary
college
was
in
fact
formally
founded
in
and
the
school
had
been
going
on
since
leach
of
winchester
while
no
such
college
as
st
john
college
at
winchester
ever
existed
chicheley
appears
in
the
of
new
college
up
to
the
year
when
he
was
a
and
was
absent
for
ten
weeks
from
about
the
of
december
to
the
of
march
presumably
for
the
purpose
of
his
ordination
as
a
which
was
performed
by
the
bishop
of
derry
acting
as
suffragan
to
the
bishop
of
london
he
was
then
already
beneficed
receiving
a
royal
ratification
of
his
estate
as
parson
of
llanvarchell
in
the
diocese
of
st
asaph
on
the
of
march
pat
in
the
marked
but
really
for
chicheley
name
does
not
appear
he
had
then
left
oxford
and
gone
up
to
london
to
practise
as
an
advocate
in
the
principal
ecclesiastical
court
the
court
of
arches
his
rise
was
rapid
already
on
the
of
february
he
was
on
a
commission
with
several
knights
and
clerks
to
hear
an
appeal
in
a
case
of
molton
esquire
john
shawe
citizen
of

sir
john
cheyne
sitting
for
the
constable
of
england
in
a
court
of
chivalry
like
other
ecclesiastical
lawyers
and
civil
servants
of
the
day
he
was
paid
with
ecclesiastical
preferments
on
the
of
april
he
obtained
ratification
of
the
parsonage
of
st
stephen
walbrook
presented
on
the
of
march
by
the
abbot
of
colchester
no
doubt
through
his
brother
robert
who
restored
the
church
and
increased
its
endowment
in
he
was
made
archdeacon
of
dorset
by
richard
mitford
bishop
of
salisbury
but
litigation
was
still
going
on
about
it
in
the
papal
court
till
the
of
june
when
the
pope
extinguished
the
suit
imposing
perpetual
silence
on
nicholas
bubwith
master
of
the
rolls
his
opponent
in
the
first
year
of
henry
iv
chicheley
was
parson
of
sherston

of
nantgwyly
in
the
college
of
abergwilly
north
wales
on
the
of

now
called

he
was
pardoned
for
bringing
in
and
allowed
to
use
a
bull
of
the
pope
providing
him
to
the
chancellorship
of
salisbury
cathedral
and
canonries
in
the
nuns
churches
of
shaftesbury
and
wilton
in
that
diocese
and
on
the
of
january
he
was
archdeacon
of
salisbury
this
year
his
brother
robert
was
senior
sheriff
of
london
on
the
of
may
pope
boniface
ix
provided
him
to
a
prebend
at
lincoln
notwithstanding
he
already
held
prebends
at
salisbury
lichfield
st
and
abergwyly
and
the
living
of
brington
on
the
of
january
he
found
time
to
attend
a
court
at
higham
ferrers
and
be
admitted
to
a
burgage
there
in
july
chicheley
began
a
diplomatic
career
by
a
mission
to
the
new
roman
pope
innocent
who
was
professing
his
desire
to
end
the
schism
in
the
papacy
by
resignation
if
his
french
rival
at
avignon
would
do
likewise
next
year
on
the
of
october
he
was
sent
with
sir
john
cheyne
to
paris
to
arrange
a
lasting
peace
and
the
marriage
of
prince
henry
with
the
french
princess
marie
which
was
frustrated
by
her
becoming
a
nun
at
poissy
next
year
in
renewed
efforts
were
made
to
stop
the
schism
and
chicheley
was
one
of
the
envoys
sent
to
the
new
pope
gregory
xii
here
he
utilized
his
opportunities
on
the
of
august
guy
mone
he
is
always
so
spelt
and
not
mohun
and
was
probably
from
one
of
the
hampshire
meons
there
was
a
john
mone
of
havant
admitted
a
winchester
scholar
in
bishop
of
st
david
died
and
on
the
of
october
chicheley
was
by
the
pope
provided
to
the
bishopric
of
st
david
another
bull
the
same
day
gave
him
the
right
to
hold
all
his
benefices
with
the
bishopric
at
siena
in
july
he
and
sir
john
cheyne
as
english
envoys
were
received
by
gregory
xii
with
special
honour
and
bishop
repingdon
of
lincoln
was
one
of
the
new
batch
of
cardinals
created
on
the
of
september
most
of
gregory
cardinals
having
deserted
him
these
together
with
benedict
revolting
cardinals
summoned
a
general
council
at
pisa
in
november
chicheley
was
back
at
westminster
when
henry
iv
received
the
cardinal
archbishop
of
bordeaux
and
determined
to
support
the
cardinals
at
pisa
against
both
popes
in
january
chicheley
was
named
with
bishop
hallum
of
salisbury
and
the
prior
of
canterbury
to
represent
the
southern
convocation
at
the
council
which
opened
on
the
of
march
arriving
on
the
of
april
obedience
was
withdrawn
from
both
the
existing
popes
and
on
the
of
june
a
new
pope
elected
instead
of
them
chicheley
and
the
other
envoys
were
received
on
their
return
as
saviours
of
the
world
though
the
result
was
summed
up
by
a
contemporary
as
trischism
instead
of
schism
and
the
church
as
giving
three
husbands
instead
of
two
chicheley
now
became
the
subject
of
a
leading
case
the
court
of
bench
deciding
after
arguments
reheard
in
three
successive
terms
that
he
could
not
hold
his
previous
benefices
with
the
bishopric
and
that
spite
of
the
maxim
potest
a
papal
bull
could
not
supersede
the
law
of
the
land
ii
iv
accordingly
he
had
to
resign
livings
and
canonries
wholesale
april
as
however
he
had
obtained
a
bull
august
enabling
him
to
appoint
his
successors
to
the
vacated
preferments
including
his
nephew
william
though
still
an
undergraduate
and
not
in
orders
to
the
chancellorship
of
salisbury
and
a
prebend
at
lichfield
he
did
not
go
empty
away
in
may
he
went
again
on
an
embassy
to
france
on
the
of
september
he
headed
a
mission
to
discuss
henry
marriage
with
a
daughter
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
he
was
again
there
in
november
in
the
interval
chicheley
found
time
to
visit
his
diocese
for
the
first
time
and
be
enthroned
at
st
david
on
the
of
may
he
was
with
the
english
force
under
the
earl
of
arundel
which
accompanied
the
duke
of
burgundy
to
paris
in
october
and
there
defeated
the
armagnacs
an
exploit
which
revealed
to
england
the
weakness
of
the
french
on
the
of
november
chicheley
with
two
other
bishops
and
three
earls
and
the
prince
of
wales
knelt
to
the
king
to
receive
public
thanks
for
their
administration
that
he
was
in
high
favour
with
henry
is
shown
by
his
being
sent
with
the
earl
of
warwick
to
france
in
july
to
conclude
peace
immediately
after
the
death
of
archbishop
arundel
he
was
nominated
by
the
king
to
the
archbishopric
elected
on
the
of
march
translated
by
papal
bull
on
the
of
april
and
received
the
pall
without
going
to
rome
for
it
on
the
of
july
these
dates
are
important
as
they
help
to
save
chicheley
from
the
charge
versified
by
shakespeare
act
sc
from
of
having
tempted
henry
into
the
conquest
of
france
for
the
sake
of
diverting
parliament
from
the
disendowment
of
the
church
there
is
no
contemporary
authority
for
the
charge
which
seems
to
appear
first
in
redman
rhetorical
history
of
henry
written
in
with
an
eye
to
the
political
situation
at
that
time
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
parliament
at
leicester
in
which
the
speeches
were
supposed
to
have
been
made
began
on
the
of
april
before
chicheley
was
archbishop
the
rolls
of
parliament
show
that
he
was
not
present
in
the
parliament
at
all
moreover
parliament
was
so
far
from
pressing
disendowment
that
on
the
petition
of
the
commons
it
passed
a
savage
act
against
the
heresies
commonly
called
lollardry
which
aimed
at
the
destruction
of
the
king
and
all
temporal
estates
making
lollards
felons
and
ordering
every
justice
of
the
peace
to
hunt
down
their
schools
conventicles
congregations
and
confederacies
in
his
capacity
of
archbishop
chicheley
remained
what
he
had
always
been
chiefly
the
lawyer
and
diplomatist
he
was
present
at
the
siege
of
rouen
and
the
king
committed
to
him
personally
the
negotiations
for
the
surrender
of
the
city
in
january
and
for
the
marriage
of
katherine
he
crowned
katherine
at
westminster
february
and
on
the
of
december
baptized
her
child
henry
vi
he
was
of
course
a
persecutor
of
heretics
no
one
could
have
attained
or
kept
the
position
of
archbishop
at
the
time
without
being
so
so
he
presided
at
the
trial
of
john
claydon
skinner
and
citizen
of
london
who
after
five
imprisonment
at
various
times
had
made
public
abjuration
before
the
late
archbishop
arundel
but
now
was
found
in
possession
of
a
book
in
english
called
lanterne
of
which
contained
the
heinous
heresy
that
the
principal
cause
of
the
persecution
of
christians
was
the
illegal
retention
by
priests
of
the
goods
of
this
world
and
that
archbishops
and
bishops
were
the
special
seats
of
antichrist
as
a
relapsed
heretic
he
was
left
to
the
secular
arm
by
chicheley
on
the
of
july
chicheley
directed
a
inquisition
by
archdeacons
to
hunt
out
heretics
on
the
of
february
proceedings
were
begun
before
him
against
william
taylor
priest
who
had
been
for
fourteen
years
excommunicated
for
heresy
and
was
now
degraded
and
burnt
for
saying
that
prayers
ought
not
to
be
addressed
to
saints
but
only
to
god
a
striking
contrast
was
exhibited
in
october
when
a
stamford
friar
john
russell
who
had
preached
that
any
religious
concumbere
cum
and
not
mortally
sin
was
sentenced
only
to
retract
his
doctrine
further
persecutions
of
a
whole
batch
of
lollards
took
place
in
the
records
of
convocation
in
chicheley
time
are
a
curious
mixture
of
persecutions
for
heresy
which
largely
consisted
in
attacks
on
clerical
endowments
with
negotiations
with
the
ministers
of
the
crown
for
the
object
of
cutting
down
to
the
lowest
level
the
clerical
contributions
to
the
public
revenues
in
respect
of
their
endowments
chicheley
was
tenacious
of
the
privileges
of
his
see
and
this
involved
him
in
a
constant
struggle
with
henry
beaufort
bishop
of
winchester
in
while
henry
was
alive
he
successfully
protested
against
beaufort
being
made
a
cardinal
and
legate
to
supersede
the
legatine
jurisdiction
of
canterbury
but
during
the
regency
after
henry
vi
accession
beaufort
was
successful
and
in
became
cardinal
and
legate
this
brought
chicheley
into
collision
with
martin
the
struggle
between
them
has
been
represented
as
one
of
a
patriotic
archbishop
resisting
the
encroachments
of
the
papacy
on
the
church
of
england
in
point
of
fact
it
was
almost
wholly
personal
and
was
rather
an
incident
in
the
rivalry
between
the
duke
of
gloucester
and
his
cardinal
beaufort
than
one
involving
any
principle
chicheley
by
appointing
a
jubilee
to
be
held
at
canterbury
in
after
the
manner
of
the
jubilee
ordained
by
the
popes
threatened
to
divert
the
profits
from
pilgrims
from
rome
to
canterbury
a
ferocious
letter
from
the
pope
to
the
papal
nuncios
on
the
of
march
denounced
the
proceeding
as
calculated
to
ensnare
simple
souls
and
extort
from
them
a
profane
reward
thereby
setting
up
themselves
against
the
apostolic
see
and
the
roman
pontiff
to
whom
alone
so
great
a
faculty
has
been
granted
by
god
pap
vii
chicheley
also
incurred
the
papal
wrath
by
opposing
the
system
of
papal
provision
which
diverted
patronage
from
english
to
italian
hands
but
the
immediate
occasion
was
to
prevent
the
introduction
of
the
bulls
making
beaufort
a
cardinal
chicheley
had
been
careful
enough
to
obtain
papal
provisions
for
himself
his
pluralities
his
bishopric
and
archbishopric
but
after
all
it
is
not
as
archbishop
or
statesman
persecutor
papalist
or
antipapalist
that
chicheley
is
remembered
but
for
his
educational
foundations
he
endowed
a
hutch
chest
or
for
poor
scholars
at
new
college
and
another
for
the
university
of
oxford
at
large
he
founded
no
less
than
three
colleges
two
at
oxford
one
at
higham
ferrers
while
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
he
suggested
and
inspired
the
foundation
of
eton
and
of
king
college
his
first
college
at
oxford
in
perishing
gave
birth
to
st
john
college
which
now
holds
its
site
this
was
st
bernard
college
founded
by
chicheley
under
licence
in
mortmain
in
for
cistercian
monks
on
the
model
of
gloucester
hall
and
durham
college
for
the
southern
and
northern
benedictines
nothing
more
than
a
site
and
building
was
required
by
way
of
endowment
as
the
young
monks
who
were
sent
there
to
study
under
a
provisor
were
supported
by
the
houses
of
the
order
to
which
they
belonged
the
site
was
five
acres
and
the
building
is
described
in
the
letters
patent
as
a
fitting
and
noble
college
mansion
in
honour
of
the
most
glorious
virgin
mary
and
st
bernard
in
northgates
street
outside
the
northgate
of
oxford
it
was
suppressed
with
the
cistercian
abbeys
in
and
granted
on
the
of
december
to
christ
church
oxford
who
sold
it
to
sir
thomas
pope
in
for
st
john
college
the
college
at
higham
ferrers
was
a
much
earlier
design
on
the
of
may
henry
in
right
of
the
duchy
of
lancaster
hearing
that
chicheley
inflamed
by
the
pious
fervour
of
devotion
intended
to
enlarge
divine
service
and
other
works
of
piety
at
higham
ferrers
in
consideration
of
his
fruitful
services
often
crossing
the
seas
yielding
to
no
toils
dangers
or
expenses
especially
in
the
conclusion
of
the
present
final
peace
with
our
dearest
father
the
king
of
france
granted
for
marks
licence
to
found
on
three
acres
at
higham
ferrers
a
perpetual
college
of
eight
chaplains
and
four
clerks
of
whom
one
was
to
teach
grammar
and
the
other
song
and
six
choristers
to
pray
for
himself
and
wife
and
for
henry
iv
and
his
wife
mary
and
to
acquire
the
alien
priory
of
merseye
in
essex
late
belonging
to
st
ouen
rouen
as
endowment
a
papal
bull
having
also
been
obtained
on
the
of
august
the
archbishop
in
the
course
of
a
visitation
of
lincoln
diocese
executed
his
letters
patent
founding
the
college
dedicating
it
to
the
virgin
st
thomas
à
becket
and
st
edward
the
confessor
and
handed
over
the
buildings
to
its
members
the
vicar
of
higham
ferrers
being
made
the
first
master
or
warden
he
further
endowed
it
in
with
lands
in
bedfordshire
and
huntingdonshire
and
his
brothers
william
and
robert
gave
some
houses
in
london
in
and
the
foundation
was
closely
modelled
on
winchester
college
with
its
warden
and
fellows
its
grammar
and
song
schoolmasters
but
a
step
in
advance
was
made
by
the
masters
being
made
fellows
and
so
members
of
the
governing
body
attached
was
also
a
bede
or
almshouse
for
twelve
poor
men
both
school
and
almshouse
had
existed
before
and
this
was
merely
an
additional
endowment
the
whole
endowment
was
in
worth
some
a
year
about
a
fifth
of
that
of
winchester
college
unfortunately
all
souls
being
a
later
foundation
the
college
at
higham
ferrers
was
not
affiliated
to
it
and
so
fell
with
other
colleges
not
part
of
the
universities
on
the
of
july
it
was
surrendered
to
henry
and
its
possessions
granted
to
robert
dacres
on
condition
of
maintaining
the
grammar
school
and
paying
the
master
a
year
the
same
salary
as
the
headmasters
of
winchester
and
eton
and
maintaining
the
almshouse
both
still
exist
but
the
school
has
been
deprived
of
its
house
and
the
fitzwilliam
family
who
now
own
the
lands
still
continue
to
pay
only
a
year
all
souls
college
was
considerably
later
the
patent
for
it
dated
of
may
is
for
a
warden
and
scholars
to
be
called
the
warden
and
college
of
the
souls
of
all
the
faithful
departed
to
study
and
pray
for
the
soul
of
king
henry

duke
of
clarence
and
all
the
dukes
earls
barons
knights
squires
and
other
nobles
and
subjects
of
our

who
during
the
time
and
in
the
service
of
our
father
and
ourselves
ended
their
lives
in
the
wars
of
the
kingdom
of

and
for
the
souls
of
all
the
faithful
departed
for
this
the
king
granted
berford
hall
formerly
charleston
inn
which
chicheley
trustees
had
granted
to
him
so
as
to
obtain
a
royal
grant
and
indefeasible
title
richard
andrews
the
king
secretary
like
chicheley
himself
a
scholar
of
winchester
and
fellow
of
new
college
was
named
as
first
warden
a
papal
bull
for
the
college
was
obtained
on
the
of
june
and
further
patents
for
endowments
from
the
of
may
to
the
of
january
when
a
general
confirmation
charter
was
obtained
for
which
at
least
of
our
money
was
paid
it
is
commonly
represented
that
the
endowment
was
wholly
derived
from
alien
priories
bought
by
chicheley
from
the
crown
in
truth
not
so
large
a
proportion
of
the
endowment
of
all
souls
was
derived
from
this
source
as
was
that
of
new
college
the
only
alien
priories
granted
were
abberbury
in
oxfordshire
wedon
pinkney
in
northamptonshire
romney
in
kent
and
st
clare
and
llangenith
in
wales
all
very
small
affairs
single
manors
and
rectories
and
these
did
not
form
a
quarter
of
the
whole
endowment
the
rest
particularly
the
manor
of
edgware
which
made
the
fortune
of
the
college
was
bought
from
private
owners
early
in
the
college
was
opened
by
chicheley
with
four
bishops
in
state
the
statutes
not
drawn
up
until
the
end
of
april
raised
the
number
of
the
college
to
forty
like
the
college
buildings
they
are
almost
an
exact
copy
of
those
of
new
college
the
college
is
sometimes
described
as
being
different
from
other
colleges
in
being
merely
a
large
chantry
to
pray
for
the
souls
of
the
dead
warriors
but
it
was
no
more
a
chantry
than
the
other
colleges
all
of
which
like
the
monasteries
and
collegiate
churches
were
to
pray
for
their
founders
and
other
specified
souls
indeed
all
souls
was
more
of
a
lay
foundation
than
its
model
for
while
at
new
college
only
twenty
out
of
seventy
fellows
were
to
study
law
instead
of
arts
philosophy
and
theology
at
all
souls
college
sixteen
were
to
be
jurists
and
only
artists
and
while
at
new
college
there
were
ten
chaplains
and
three
clerks
necessarily
at
all
souls
the
number
was
not
defined
but
left
optional
so
that
there
are
now
only
one
chaplain
and
four
bible
clerks
ten
days
after
he
sealed
the
statutes
on
the
of
april
chicheley
died
and
was
buried
in
canterbury
cathedral
on
the
north
side
of
the
choir
under
a
fine
effigy
of
himself
erected
in
his
lifetime
there
is
what
looks
like
an
excellent
contemporary
portrait
in
one
of
the
windows
of
all
souls
college
which
is
figured
in
the
county
for
hampshire
ii
or
chichen
an
ancient
ruined
city
of
yucatan
mexico
situated
of
valladolid
the
name
is
derived
from
that
of
the
itza
a
tribe
of
the
great
mayan
stock
which
formerly
inhabited
the
city
and
having
reference
probably
to
two
wells
or
pools
which
doubtless
originally
supplied
the
inhabitants
with
water
and
are
still
in
existence
the
history
of
the
city
is
unknown
though
it
is
regarded
as
probable
that
it
preserved
its
independence
long
after
the
spaniards
had
taken
possession
of
the
rest
of
the
district

covered

by

chichester
rendered
valuable
service
under

in
the

against

rebellious

in

recommended
him
to

of

as
the
fittest
person
to
be
entrusted
with
the
government
of
ulster
on
the
of
october
chichester
was
appointed
of
ireland
he
announced
his
policy
in
a
proclamation
wherein
he
abolished
the
rights
of
the
native
irish
chieftains
substituting
for
them
fixed
dues
while
their
tenants
were
to
become
dependent
wholly
and
immediately
upon
his
majesty
tyrone
and
other
irish
clan
chieftains
resented
this
summary
interference
with
their
ancient
social
organization
and
their
resistance
was
strengthened
by
the
measures
against
the
roman
catholics
which
chichester
was
compelled
to
take
by
the
orders
of
the
english
ministers
he
himself
was
moderate
and
enlightened
in
his
views
on
this
matter
and
it
was
through
his
influence
that
the
harshness
of
the
policy
was
relaxed
in
meantime
his
difficulties
with
the
irish
tribal
leaders
remained
unsolved
but
in
by
the
flight
of
the
earls
see
he
was
relieved
of
the
presence
of
the
two
formidable
ulster
chieftains
the
earls
of
tyrone
and
tyrconnell
chichester
policy
for
dealing
with
the
situation
thus
created
was
to
divide
the
lands
of
the
fugitive
earls
among
irishmen
of
standing
and
character
but
the
plantation
of
ulster
as
actually
carried
out
was
much
less
favourable
and
just
to
the
native
population
than
the
desired
in
chichester
was
raised
to
the
peerage
as
baron
chichester
of
belfast
and
in
the
following
year
he
went
to
england
to
give
an
account
of
the
state
of
ireland
on
his
return

to

as
to
gain

with

but
he
formed

demonstrated
in

and
the
main
body
secretly
crossed
the
river
about
stevenson
and

the
country
was
mountainous
the
roads
few
and
poor
and
the
federals
had
to
take
full
supplies
of
food

and
ammunition
with
them
but
rosecrans
was
an
able
commander
his
troops
were
in
good
hands
and
he
accepted
the
risks
involved
these
were
intensified
by
the
want
of
good
maps
and
in
the
event
at
one
moment
the
army
was
placed
in
a
position
of

danger
a
corps
under
mcd
mccook
moved
across
the
ridges
to
alpine
another
under
thomas
marched
via
trenton
on
mclemore
cove
the
presence
of
federal
masses
in
lookout
valley
caused
bragg
to
abandon
chattanooga
at
once
and
the
object
of
the
manoeuvre
was
thus
accomplished
but
owing
to
the
want
of
good
maps
the
union
army
was
at
the
same
time
exposed
to
great
danger
the
head
of
thomas

was
engaged
at

was
far
away

and
crittenden
corps
which
had
occupied
chattanooga
on
the
was
also
at
a
distance
thomas
was
isolated
but
rosecrans
like
every
other
commander
under
whom
he
served
placed
unbounded
confidence
in
his
tenacity
and
if
bragg
was
wrong
in
neglecting
to
attack
him
on
the
subsequent
events
went
far
to
disarm
criticism
by
the
of
september
rosecrans
had
at
last
collected
his
army
on
chickamauga
creek
covering
chattanooga

bragg
had
now
received
heavy
reinforcements
and
lay
concentrated

the
terrain
of

of

had
little
influence
on
its
course
both
armies
lay
in
the
plain
the
two
lines
roughly
parallel
bragg
intention
was
to
force
his
attack
home
on
rosecrans
left
wing
thus
cutting
him
off
from

throwing
him
back

the
confederates
in

pressed
hard
upon
thomas
to
whom
rosecrans
sent
reinforcements
one
of
the
divisions
detached
from
the
centre
for
this
purpose
was
by
inadvertence
taken
out
of

line

could
be
filled
the

routed
and
the
centre
shared
its
fate
rosecrans
himself
was
swept
off
the
field
in
the
rout
of
half
of
his
army
but
thomas
was
unshaken
he
the
left
wing
in
a
semicircle
and
aided
by
a
few
fresh
brigades
from

resisted
for
six
hours

whole

rosecrans
in
the
meantime
was
rallying

fugitives
far
to

the
fury
of

assault
spent
itself
uselessly
on
the
heroic
divisions
under
thomas
who
remained
on

field
till
night
and
then
withdrew
in
good
order
to

here
he
remained
on

imposing
respect

by
an
eruption
of
vesicles
in

skin
the
disease
usually
occurs
in
epidemics
and
is
one
of
childhood
the
patients
being
generally
between
two
and
six
years
old
the
incubation
period
is
from
ten
to
fifteen
days
there
are
practically
no
prodromal
symptoms
the
only
indication
being
a
slight
amount
of
fever
for
some
hours
after
which
the
eruption
makes
its
appearance
a
number
of
raised
red
papules
appear
on
the
trunk
either
on
the
back
or
chest
in
from
twelve
to
hours
these
develop
into
tense
vesicles
filled
with
a
clear
fluid
which
in
another
hours
or
so
becomes
opalescent
during
the
fourth
day
these
vesicles
dry
and
shrivel
up

the
scabs
fall
off
leaving
as
a
rule
no
scar
fresh
spots
appear
during
the
first
three
days
so
that
at
the
end
of
that
time
they
can
be
seen
in
all
stages
of
growth
and
decay
the
eruption
is
most
marked
on
the
chest
but
it
also
occurs
on
the
face
and
limbs
and
on
the
mucous
membrane
of
the

the
temperature
begins
to
fall
after

amount
may
persist

symptoms

favourable
course
in

cases
and
after
effects
are
rare
one
attack
does
not
confer
immunity
and
in
numerous
cases
one
individual
has
had
three
attacks
the
diet
should
be
light
and
the
patient
should
be
prevented
from
scratching
the
spots
which
would
lead
to
ulceration
and
scarring
after
the
first
few
days
there
is
no
necessity
to
confine
the
patient
to
bed
in
the
large
majority
of
cases
it
is
easy
to
distinguish
the
disease
from
smallpox
but
in
certain
patients
it
is
very
difficult
the
chief
points
in
the
differential
diagnosis
are
as

in

rash
is
distributed
chiefly
on
the
trunk
and
less
on

is
cultivated
much
more
extensively
on
the
continent
of
europe
in
holland
belgium

germany
than
in

britain
and
as
a
cultivated
plant
it
has
three
distinct
applications
its
roots
roasted
and
ground
are
used
as
a
substitute
for
adulterant
of
or
addition
to
coffee
both
roots
and
leaves
are
employed
as
salads
and
the
plant
is
grown
as
a
fodder
or
herbage
crop
which
is
greedily
consumed
by
cattle
in
great
britain
it
is
chiefly
in
its
first
capacity
in
connexion
with
coffee
that
chicory
is
employed
a
large
proportion
of
the
chicory
root
used
for
this
purpose
is
obtained
from
belgium
and
other
neighbouring
continental
countries
but
a
considerable
quantity
is
cultivated
in
england
chiefly
in
yorkshire
for
the
preparation
of
chicory
the
older
stout
white
roots
are
selected
and
after
washing
they
are
sliced
up
into
small
pieces
and
in
this
condition
the
material
is
sold
to
the
chicory
roaster
by
whom
it
is
roasted
till
it
assumes
a
deep
brown
colour
afterwards
when
ground
it
is
in
external
characteristics
very
like
coffee
but
is
destitute
of
its
pleasing
aromatic
odour
neither
does
the
roasted
chicory
possess
any
trace
of
the
alkaloid
caffeine
which
gives
their
peculiar
virtues
to
coffee
and
tea
the
fact
however
that
for
over
a
hundred
years
it
has
been
successfully
used
as
a
substitute
for
or
recognized
addition
to
coffee
while
in
the
meantime
innumerable
other
substances
have
been
tried
for
the
same
purpose
and
abandoned
indicates
that
it
is
agreeable
and
harmless
it
gives
the
coffee
additional
colour
bitterness
and
body
it
is

extensive

general
use

in

especially
its

at

the

grow
very
strong
they
are
cut
off
perhaps
in
the
middle
of
august
about
an
inch
from

so
as
to
promote
the
production
of

check

all
the

cut
off
the

also
shortened

they
are
then
planted

closely
together

needful
when

comes
on
the
boxes

protected
by

kind
of
litter

as
the

is
wanted
they
are
removed
into

place

a
moderately
increased
temperature

where
there
is
no
light
each
box
affords
two
crops
of

are
reckoned
fit
for
cutting

about
in

another
mode
of

both

it
must
be
borne
in
mind
as

a
great
deal
of
the
voluminous
literature
of
the
subject
that
it
is
often
more
pertinent

to
any
special
conclusions

the
child
after
all
is
in
a
transition
stage
to
an

there

often
a
tendency
in
modern
child
students
to
interpret
the
phenomena
exhibited
by
a
particular
child
with
a
or
to
exaggerate
which
is
really
interesting
as
providing
the
knowledge
of
growth
towards
full
human
equipment
as
though
it
involved
the
discovery
of
some
distinct
form
of
animal
of
separate
value
on
its
own
account
into
the
psychical
characteristics
and
development
of
the
child
and
all
the
interesting
educational
problems
involved
it
is
impossible
to
enter
here
and
reference
must
be
made
to
the
works
cited
above
but
a
knowledge
of
the
more
important
features
of
normal
physical
development
has
a
constant
importance

of
these
as
matters

one
of
these
chief
matters

children
law
relating
to
english
law
has
always
in
theory
given
to
children
the
same
remedies
as
to
adults
for
whether
by
their
parents
or
by
others
and
has
never
recognized
the
as
known
to
the
earlier
roman
law
and
while
powers
of
discipline
and
chastisement
have
been
regarded
as
necessarily
incident
to
paternal
authority
the
father
is
civilly
liable
to
his
children
for
wrongs
done
to
them
the
only
points
in
which
infancy
created
a
defect
in
civil
status
were
that
infants
were
subject
to
the
restraints
on
complete
freedom
of
action
involved
in
their
being
in
the
legal
custody
of
the
father
and
that
it
was
and
is
lawful
for
parents
guardians
employers
and
teachers
to
inflict
corporal
punishment
proportioned
in
amount
and
severity
to
the
nature
of
the
fault
committed
and
the
age
and
mental
capacity
of
the
child
punished
but
the
court
of
chancery
in
delegated
exercise
of
the
authority
of
the
sovereign
as
always
asserted
the
right
to
take
from
parents
and
if
necessary
itself
to
assume
the
wardship
of
children
where
parental
rights
were
abused
or
serious
cruelty
was
inflicted
the
power
being
vested
in
the
high
court
of
justice
abuse
of
the
power
of
correction
was
regarded
as
giving
a
cause
of
action
or
prosecution
for
assault
and
if
attended
by
fatal
results
rendered
the
parent
liable
to
indictment
for
murder
or
manslaughter
the
conception
of
what
constitutes
cruelty
to
children
undoubtedly
changed
considerably
with
the
relaxation
of
the
accepted
standard
of
severity
in
domestic
or
scholastic
discipline
and
with
the
growth
of
new
ideas
as
to
the
duties
of
parents
to
children
which
in
their
latest
developments
tend
enormously
to
enlarge
the
parental
duties
without
any
corresponding
increase
of
filial
obligations
starting
from
the
earlier
conception
which
limited
legally
punishable
to
actual
threats
or
blows
the
common
law
came
to
recognize
criminal
liability
in
cases
where
persons
bound
under
duty
or
contract
to
supply
necessaries
to
a
child
unable
by
reason
of
its
tender
years
to
provide
for
itself
wilfully
neglected
to
supply
them
and
thereby
caused
the
death
of
the
child
or
injury
to
its
health
although
no
actual
assault
had
been
committed
questions
have
from
time
to
time
arisen
as
to
what
could
be
regarded
as
necessary
within
this
rule
and
quite
apart
from
legislation
popular
opinion
has
influenced
courts
of
justice
in
requiring
more
from
parents
and
employers
than
used
to
be
required
but
parliament
has
also
intervened
to
punish
abandonment
or
exposure
of
infants
of
under
two
years
whereby
their
lives
are
endangered
or
their

in
favour
of
parents
who
had
not
sufficient
means
to
do
their
duty
without
resort
to
the
poor

and
was
construed
as
imposing
criminal
liability
on
parents

peculiar
religious
tenets
caused
them
advisedly
to
refrain
from
calling
in
a
doctor
to
a

child
the
chief
progress
in
the
direction
of
adequate
protection
for
children
prior
to
lay
less
in
positive
legal
enactment
on
the
subject
than
in
the
institution
of
an
effective
system
of
police
whereby
it
became
possible
to
discover
and
repress
cruelty
punishable
under
the
ordinary
law
it
is
quite
inaccurate
to
say
that
children
had
very
few
rights
in
england
or
that
animals
were
better
protected
but
before
the
constitution
of
the
present
police
force
and
in
the
absence
of
any
proper
system
of
public
prosecution
it
is
undeniable
that
numberless
cases
of
neglect
and
went
unpunished
and
were
treated
as
nobody
business
because
there
was
no
person
ready
to
undertake
in
the
public
interest
the
protection
of
the
children
of
cruel
or
negligent
parents
in
a
statute
was
passed
with
the
special
object
of
preventing
cruelty
to
children
this
act
was
superseded
in
by
a
more
stringent
act
which
was
repealed
by
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
children
act
in
its
turn
superseded
for
the
most
part
by
the
children
act
which
introduced
many
new
provisions
in
the
law
relating
to
children
and
specifically
deals
with
the
offence
of
cruelty
to
them
this
offence
can

be
committed
by
a
person
over
sixteen
in

of

a
person
cohabiting
with
its

or
of
its

the

interested
in
any

of

permitted
under
the
friendly
societies
acts
a
parent
or
other
person
legally
liable
to

person
will
be
deemed
to

by
failure

under
acts
relating
to
the
relief
of
the
poor
these
statutes
overlap
the
common
law
and
the
statutes
already
mentioned
their
real
efficacy
lies
in
the
main
in
the
provisions
which
facilitate
the
taking
of
evidence
of
young
children
in
permitting
poor
law
authorities
to
prosecute
at
the
expense
of
the
rates
and
in
permitting
a
constable
on
arresting
the
offender
to
take
the
child
away
from
the
accused
and
the
court
of
trial
on
conviction
to
transfer
the
custody
of
the
child
from
the
offender
to
some
fit
and
willing
person
including
any
society
or
body
corporate
established
for
the
reception
of
poor
children
or
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
children
the
provisions
of
the
acts
as
to
procedure
and
custody
extend
not
only
to
the
offence
of
cruelty
but
also
to
all
offences
involving
bodily
injury
to
a
child
under
sixteen
such
as
abandonment
assault
kidnapping
and
illegally
engaging
a
child
in
a
dangerous
public
performance
the
act
of
also
makes
an
endeavour
to
check
the
heavy
mortality
of
infants
through
overlaying
enacting
that
where
it
is
proved
that
the
death
of
an
infant
under
three
years
of
age
was
caused
by
suffocation
whilst
the
infant
was
in
bed
with
some
other

there
has
been
some

whether

the
causal
derivative
of

is
followed
by
two
objects

children
courts
or
juvenile
courts
a
special
system
of
tribunals
for
dealing
with
juvenile
offenders
first
suggested
in
the
united
states
the
germ
of
such
institutions
was
planted
in
massachusetts
in
when
a
plan
was
introduced
at
boston
of
hearing
charges
against
children
separately
and
apart
from
the
ordinary
business
of
the
lesser
tribunals
no
great
progress
was
made
in
the
development
of
the
idea
in
massachusetts
as
the
legal
authorities
were
not
fully
convinced
of
the
utility
or
need
for
a
separate
court
so
long
as
the
children
were
kept
strictly
apart
from
adults
and
this
could
be
assured
by
a
separate
session
but
the
system
of
probation
by
which
children
were
handed
over
to
the
kindly
care
and
guardianship
of
an
appointed
officer
and
thus
escaped
legal
repression
was
created
about
the
same
time
in
boston
and
produced
excellent
results
the
probation
officer
is
present
at
the
judge
side
when
he
decides
a
case
and
is
given
charge
of
the
offender
whom
he
takes
by
the
hand
either
at
his
parent
residence
or
at
school
and
continually
supervises
having
power
if
necessary
to
bring
him
again
before
the
judge
the
example
of
massachusetts
in
due
course
influenced
other
countries
and
especially
the
british
colony
of
south
australia
where
a
state
children
department
was
created
at
adelaide
in
and
three
years
later
a
juvenile
court
was
opened
there
for
the
trial
of
persons
under
eighteen
and
was
conducted
with
great
success
though
the
system
of
probation
officers
was
not
introduced
a
juvenile
court
was
also
established
at
toronto
canada
on
the
south
australian
model
the
movement
when
once
fully
appreciated
went
ahead
very
rapidly
in
the
united
states
illinois
was
the
first
state
to
call
a
distinct
court
into
existence
and
judge
richard
tuthill
was
the
pioneer
at
chicago
where
the
court
was
established
in
many
states
followed
suit
including
new
york
pennsylvania
rhode
island
wisconsin
kansas
colorado
indiana
and
others
till
the
number
rose
to
nineteen
in
in
new
york
where
juvenile
probation
is
supervised
by
the
society
for
the
protection
of
children
there
is
a
separate
children
court
with
rooms
attached
where
the
children
for
detention
wait
till
they
are
brought
in
for
trial
brooklyn
has
also
a
children
court
in
pennsylvania
where
the
juvenile
court
was
at
first
opposed
as
unconstitutional
the
difficulty
was
met
by
first
bringing
the
child
before
the
magistrate
in
the
police
court
a
course
which
though
followed
by
his
transferring
the
case
to
the
special
court
perpetuated
the
very
evils
the
children
court
was
intended
to
avoid
the
work
of
probation
was
however
most
effectively
carried
out
chiefly
by
female
officers
the
chicago
juvenile
court
sits
twice
weekly
under
an
especially
appointed
judge
and
policemen
act
as
probation
officers
to
some
extent
the
court
of
indianapolis
however
gained
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
complete
and
perfect
in
the
united
states
it
works
with
a
large
and
highly
efficient
band
of
volunteer
probation
officers
under
a
chief
the
juvenile
court
of
denver
colorado
attained
remarkable
results
under
judge
lindsey
whose
magnetic
personality
wonderful
comprehension
of
boy
nature
and
extraordinary
influence
over
them
achieved
great
results
the
court
meets
once
a
fortnight
when
fresh
cases
are
tried
and
boys
already
on
probation
report
themselves
often
to
the
number
of
two
hundred
at
a
time
the
latter
appear
before
the
judge
in
batches
each
hands
in
his
school
report
in
a
sealed
letter
and
according
to
its
purport
receives
praise
or
blame
or
he
may
be
committed
to

house
an
efficient
court
was
also
constituted
at
baltimore
maryland
with
a
judge
especially
chosen
to
preside

being
for
fixed
periods
varying
from
three
months
to
three
years

being
brought

for
parole
or
discharge

if
necessary
committal

of
the
philanthropic
societies
in
washington
the
system
of
having
no
distinct
court
or
judge
but
holding
a
separate
session
was
followed
and
it
was
found
that
numbers
of
children
came
to
the
court
for
help
and
guidance
looking
upon
the
judge
for
the
time
being
as
their
friend
and
counsellor
probation
in
this
instance
offered
peculiar
difficulties
on
account
of
the
colour
question
of
the
children
having
negro
blood
and
a
white
boy
being
always
preferred
for
a
vacant
situation
throughout
the
action
of
juvenile
courts
in
the
united
states
has
been
to
bring
each
individual
into
human
touch
with
kindly
helpful
workers
striving
to
lead
the
young
idea
aright
and
train
it
to
follow
the
straight
path
it
was
the
result
always
of
the
effort
of
private
persons
and
not
due
to
government
initiative
indeed
the
advocates
and
champions
of
the
system
only
established
it
by
overcoming
strong
opposition
from
the
authorities
progress
in
the
same
direction
has
been
made
in
england
the
home
office
had
recommended
london
police
magistrates
to
keep
children
cases
separate
from
those
of
adults
the
same
practice
or
something
analogous
obtained
in
many
county
boroughs
such
as
bath
birmingham
bristol
bolton
bradford
hull
manchester
walsall
halifax
and
others
and
the
children
act
definitely
established
children

this
act
enacted
that

are
held

must
be
made
for
preventing

apparently
under

concerned
in
the
case
from
being
present
in
a
juvenile
court
except
by
leave
of
the
court
press
representatives
are
also
excepted
the
main
object
of
the
whole
system
is
to
keep
the
child
the
embryotic
offender
who
has
probably
erred
from
ignorance
or
the
pressure
of
circumstances
or
misfortune
altogether
free
from
the
taint
or
contagion
that
attaches
to
criminal
proceedings
the
moral
atmosphere
of
a
legal
tribunal
is
injurious
to
the
youthful
mind
and
children
who
appear
before
a
bench
whether
as
accused
or
as
witness
gain
a
contemptuous
familiarity
with
legal
processes
the
most
beneficial
action
of
the
children
court
comes
from
its
association
with
the
system
of
personal
guardianship
and
close
supervision
exercised
by
the
probation
officers
official
and
voluntary
where
the
intervention
of
the
newly
constituted
tribunal
can
not
only
save
the
child
from
evil
association
when
first
arrested
but
can
rescue
him
without
condemnation
and
committal
to
prison
its
functions
may
be
relied
upon
to
diminish
crime
by
cutting
it
off
at
the
source
much
depends
upon
the
quality
and
temperament
of
the
presiding
authority
where
a
judge
with
special
aptitude
can
be
appointed
firm
sympathetic
tactful
and
able
to
gain
the
confidence
of
those
brought
before
him
he
may
do
great
good
by
dealing
with
each
individual
and
not
merely
with
his
offence
realizing
that
the
court
does
not
exist
to
condemn
but
to
strengthen
and
give
a
fresh
chance
where
the
children
court
is
only
a
branch
of
the
existing
jurisdiction
worked
by
the
regular
magistrate
or
judge
fulfilling
his
ordinary
functions
and
not
specially
chosen
the
beneficial
results
are
not
so
noticeable
children
games
the
study
of
traditional
games
has
in
recent
years
become
an
important
branch
of
folklore
research
in
england
and
has
contributed
not
a
little
towards
elucidating
many
unrecorded
facts
in
early
history
these
games
may
be
broadly
divided
into
two
kinds
dramatic
games
and
games
of
skill
and
chance
these
differ
materially
in
their
object
games
of
skill
and
chance
are
played
for
the
purpose
of
winning
property
from
a
less
fortunate
player
the
dramatic
games
consist
of
and
singing
games
they
are
divided
between
boys
games
and
girls
games
boys
games
are
mostly
of
a
contest
character
girls
of
a
more
domestic
type
the
boys
dramatic
games
have
preserved
some
interesting
beliefs
and
customs
but
the
tendency
in
these
games
such
as
prisoner
base
has
been
to
drop
the
words
and
tune
and
to
preserve
only
that
part
action
which
tends
best
for
exercise
and
use
in
school
playgrounds
the
girls
have
not
developed
on
these
lines
and
have
therefore
not
lost
so
much
of
their
early
characteristics
the
singing
games
consist
of
words
tune
and
action
the
words
in
verse
express
ideas
contained
in
customs
not
now
in
vogue
and
they
may
be
traced
back
to
events
taking
place
between
men
and
women
and
between
people
of
different
villages
the
tunes
are
simple
and
the
same
tune
is
frequently
used
for
different
games
the
actions
are
illustrative
of
the
ideas
to
be
expressed
the
players
represent
various
objects
animals
villages
and
people
the
singing
game
is
therefore
not
a
game
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
word
there
is
no
element
of
gambling
or
playing
to
win
in
it
no
one
is
richer
or
poorer
for
it
it
also
requires
a
number
of
children
to
play
together
it
is
really
a
play
and
has
survived
because
it
has
handed
down
some
instances
of
custom
and
belief
which
were
deeply
rooted
and
which
made
a
strong
appeal
to
the
imagination
of
our
ancestors
the
singing
games
represent
in
dramatic
form
the
survival
of
those
ceremonial
dances
common
to
people
in
early
stages
of
development
these
dances
celebrated
events
which
served
to
bind
the
people
together
and
to
give
them
a
common
interest
in
matters
affecting
their
welfare
they
were
dramatic
in
character
singing
and
action
forming
a
part
of
them
and
their
performers
were
connected
by
ties
of
place
or
kindred
they
are
probably
survivals
of
what
we
might
call
folk
drama
in
these
times
it
was
held
imperative
to
perform
religious
ceremonies
periodically
at
sowing
and
harvesting
to
ensure
good
crops
in
the
care
of
cattle
and
on
occasions
of
marriage
birth
and
death
these
were
matters
affecting
the
welfare
of
the
whole
community
events
were
celebrated
with
dance
song
and
feasting
and
no
event
was
too
trivial
to
be
unconnected
with
some
belief
which
rendered
ceremony
necessary
at
first
these
ceremonial
dances
had
deep
religious
feeling
for
their
basis
but
in
process
of
time
they
became
purely
secular
and
were
performed
at
certain
seasons
only
because
it
was
the
custom
to
do
so
they
then
became
recognized
as
beautiful
or
pleasing
things
in
the
life
of
the
people
and
so
continued
altering
somewhat
in
ideas
but
retaining
their
old
dramatic
forms
they
were
danced
by
old
and
young
at
festivals
and
holidays
these
being
held
about
the
same
time
of
year
as
that
at
which
the
previous
religious
ceremonies
had
been
held
singing
games
are
danced
principally
in
one
of
two
methods
line
and
circle
these
represent
two
of
the
early
forms
of
dramatic
action
the
line
form
two
lines
of
players
standing
opposite
each
other
having
a
space
of
ground
between
them
advancing
and
retiring
in
turn
represents
two
different
and
opposing
parties
engaged
in
a
struggle
or
contest
this
method
is
used
in
all
cases
where
contest
is
involved
the
circle
form
on
the
other
hand
where
all
players
join
hands
represents
those
occasions
when
all
the
people
of
one
place
were
engaged
in
celebrating
events
in
which
all
were
interested
thus
games
celebrating
sowing
and
harvest
and
those
associated
with
love
and
marriage
are
played
in
this
form
both
these
methods
allow
of
development
the
circle
varies
from
examples
where
all
perform
the
same
actions
and
say
the
same
words
to
that
where
two
or
more
players
have
principal
parts
the
others
only
singing
or
acting
in
dumb
show
to
examples
where
the
singing
has
disappeared
the
form
or
method
of
play
and
the
actions
constitute
the
oldest
remaining
parts
of
the
game
the
words
being
subject
to
alterations
and
loss
through
ignorance
of
their
meaning
and
it
is
to
this
form
or
method
the
actions
and
the
accompaniment
of
song
that
they
owe
their
survival
appealing
as
they
do
to
the
strong
dramatic
instinct
of
children
and
of
uncultured
folk
it
will
be
convenient
to
give
a
few
instances
of
the
singing
games
in
line
form
a
fighting
game
is
we
are
the
rovers
the
words
tell
us
of
two
opposing
parties
fighting
for
their
land
both
sides
alternately
deride
one
another
and
end
by
fighting
until
one
side
is
victorious
two
other
line
games
nuts
in
may
and
here
come
three
dukes
are
also
games
of
contest
but
not
for
territory
these
show
an
early
custom
of
obtaining
wives
they
represent
marriage
by
capture
and
are
played
in
line
form
because
of
the
element
of
contest
contained
in
the
custom
another
form
the
arch
is
also
used
to
indicate
contest
circle
games
on
the
contrary
show
such
customs
as
harvest
and
marriage
with
love
and
courting
and
a
ceremony
and
sanction
by
assembled
friends
oats
and
beans
and
barley
and
sally
water
are
typical
of
this
form
the
large
majority
of
circle
games
deal
with
love
or
marriage
and
domestic
life
the
customs
surviving
in
these
games
deal
with
tribal
life

chile
may

into
three
regions
the
desert
region
of
the
north
the
central
agricultural
region
between
the
provinces
of
coquimbo
and
llanquihue
and
the
rainy
region
south
of
lat
the
desert
region
is
an
elevated
arid
plateau
descending
gradually
from
the
andes
towards
the
coast
where
it
breaks
down
abruptly
from
elevations
of
to
from
the
sea
this
plateau
escarpment
has
the
appearance
of
a
range
of
flat
topped
hills
closely
following
the
coast
line
the
surface
is
made
up
of
extensive
plains
covered
with
sand
and
deposits
of
alkaline
salts
broken
by
ranges
of
barren
hills
having
the
appearance
of
spurs
from
the
andes
and
by
irregular
lateral
ranges
in
the
vicinity
of
the
main
cordillera
enclosing
elevated
saline
plateaus
this
region
is
rainless
barren
and
inhospitable
absolutely
destitute
of
vegetation
except
in
some
small
river
valleys
where
irrigation
is
possible
and
on
the
slopes
of
some
of
the
peaks
where
the
water
from
the
melting
snows
nourishes
a
scanty
and
coarse
vegetation
before
it
disappears
in
the
thirsty
sands
it
is
very
rich
in
mineral
and
saline
deposits
however
the
eastern
parts
of
this
region
lie
within
the
higher
ranges
of
the
andes
and
include
a
large
district
awarded
to

this
arid
bleak
area
is
apparently
a
continuation
southward
of
the
great

known
as

to
frequent
volcanic

disturbances
in
some
instances
since
european
occupation
violent
earthquake
shocks
have
resulted
in
considerable
elevations
of
certain
parts
of
the
coast
after
the
great
earthquake
of
captain
robert

of

found
putrid
still
adhering

above
high

on
the
island

charles
darwin
declares
in
describing
that
disaster
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
land
round
the
bay
of
concepción
was
upraised
two
or
three

these
upheavals
however

permanent
the

on

after
the
existence
of

shows
that
these
forces
supplemented
by
a
gradual
uplifting
of
the
coast
have
been
in
operation
through
long
periods
of
time
and
that
the
greater
part
of
central

southern
chile
has
been
raised
from

in

these
earthquake
shocks
have
two
distinct
characteristics
a
slight
vibration
sometimes
almost
imperceptible
called
a
generally
occurring
at
frequent
intervals
and
a
violent
horizontal
or
rotary
vibration
or
motion
also
repeated
at
frequent
intervals
called
a
which
is
caused
by
a
fracture
or
displacement
of
the
earth
strata
at
some
particular
point
and
often
results
in
considerable
damage
when
the
earthquake
occurs
on
the
coast
or
beneath
the
sea
in
its
vicinity
tidal
waves
are
sometimes
formed
which
cause
even
greater
damage
than
the
earthquake
itself
arica
has
been
three
times
destroyed
by
tidal
waves
and
other
small
towns
of
the
north
chilean
coast
have
suffered
similar
disasters
coquimbo
was
swept
by
a
tidal
wave
in
and
concepción
and
talcahuano
were
similarly
destroyed
in
the
great
earthquake
which
partially
destroyed
valparaiso
in
however
was
not
followed
by
a
tidal
wave
these
violent
shocks
are
usually
limited
to
comparatively
small
districts
though
the
vibrations
may
be
felt
at
long
distances
from
the
centre
of
disturbance
in
this
respect
chile
may
be
divided
into
at
least
four
great
earthquake
areas
two
in
the
desert
region
the
third
enclosing
valparaiso
and
the
fourth
extending
from
concepción
to
chiloé
a
study
of
chilean
earthquake
phenomena
however
would
probably
lead
to
a
division
of
southern

into
two
or
more
distinct
earthquake
areas

the

the

it
has
likewise
been
determined
since

a
noteworthy
peculiarity
of
southern
chile
from

the
formation
of

important
but
they
are

the
only

most
of

they
lie
on

serve
the
purpose
of
great

with
one
exception
they
all
drain

chile
may
be
divided
longitudinally
into
two
regions
which
differ
from

in

geological
structure
along
the
coast
lies
a
belt
of
granite
and
schist
overlaid
unconformably
by
cretaceous
and
tertiary
deposits
inland
the

are
formed
chiefly
of
folded
mesozoic

together
with
volcanic
rocks
of

the
great
longitudinal
valley
of

runs
approximately
but
only
approximately
along
the
boundary
between
the
two
zones
towards
the
north
the
coastal
zone
disappears
beneath
the
sea
and
the
andean
zone
reaches
to
the
shore
the
ancient
rocks
which
form
the
most
characteristic
feature
of
the
former
do
indeed
occur
upon
the
coast
of
peru
but
in
the
north
of
chile
they
are
found
only
in
isolated
masses
standing
close
to
the
shore
or
as
at
mejillones
projecting
into
the
sea
south
of
antofagasta
the
old
rocks
form
a
nearly
continuous
band
along
the
coast
extending
as
far
as
cape
horn
and
staten
island
and
occupying
the
greater
part
of
the
islands
of
southern
chile
lithologically
they
are
crystalline
schists
together
with
granite
diorite
gabbro
and
other
igneous
rocks
they
are
known
to
be
but
whether
they
are
palaeozoic
or
archaean
is
uncertain
they
are
strongly
folded
and
are
overlaid
unconformably
by
cretaceous
and
tertiary
deposits
in
the
north
both
the
cretaceous
and
tertiary
beds
of
this
zone
are
limited
in
extent
but
towards
the
south
mesozoic
beds
which
are
at
least
in
part
cretaceous
form
a
band
of
considerable
width
the
tertiary
beds
include
both
marine
and
terrestrial
deposits
and
appear
to
be
chiefly
of
miocene
and
pliocene
age
the
whole
of
the
north
part
of
tierra
del

is
occupied
by
plateaus
of
horizontal
tertiary
strata
the
chilean
andes
correspond
with
the
western
cordillera
of
bolivia
and
peru
and
consist
almost
entirely
of
jurassic
and
cretaceous
beds
together
with
the
products
of
the
tertiary
eruptions
the
mesozoic
beds
are
thrown
into
a
series
of
parallel
folds
which
run
in
the
direction
of
the
chain
and
which
are
generally
free
from
any
complications
such
as
overthrusting
or
overfolding
the
cretaceous
beds
form
a
synclinal
upon
the
eastern
side
of
the

and
in

beyond
the

boundary
while
the

are
thrown
into
a
number
of

which
form
the
axis
and
the
western
flank
through
the
mesozoic

are
intruded
granitic
and
other
igneous
rocks
of

age
and
upon
the
folded
mesozoic
foundation
rise
the
volcanic

later
date
the
trias
is
known
only
at
la
ternera
near
copiapó
where
with
rhaetic
plants
have
been
found
but
the
rest
of
the
mesozoic
series
from
the
lias
to
the
upper
cretaceous
appears
to
be
represented
without
a
break
of
more
than
local
importance
the
deposits
are
marine
consisting
mainly
of
sandstone
and
limestone
together
with
tuffs
and
conglomerates
of
porphyry
and
porphyrite
these
porphyritic
rocks
form
a
characteristic
feature
of
the
southern
andes
and
were
at
one
time
supposed
to
be
metamorphic
but
they
are
certainly
volcanic
and
as
they
contain
marine
fossils
they
must
have
been
laid
down
beneath
the
sea
they
are
not
confined
to
any
one
horizon
but
occur
irregularly
throughout
the
jurassic
and
occasionally
also
amongst
the
cretaceous
strata
they
form
in
fact
a
special
facies
which
may
frequently
be
traced
laterally
into
the
more
normal
marine
deposit
of
the
same
age
the
fauna
of
the
mesozoic
beds
is
very
rich
and
includes
forms
which
are
found
in
northern
europe
others
which
occur
in
central
europe
and
others
again
which
are
characteristic
of
the
mediterranean
region
it
lends
no
support
to
neumayr
theory
of
climatic
zones
a
large
part
of
the
chain
is
covered
by
the
products
of
the
great
volcanoes
which
still
form
the
highest
summits
of
the
chilean
and
argentine
andes
the
rocks
are
liparites
dacites
hornblende
and
pyroxene
andesites
the
recent
lavas
of
the
still
active
volcanoes
of
the

are

basalt
the
climate
of
chile
varies
widely
from
the
tropical
heat
and
extreme
arid
conditions
of
the
northern
coast
to
the
low
temperatures
and
extreme
humidity
of
western
tierra

and
the
southern
coast
the
high
altitudes
of
the
andean
region
also
introduce
vertical
zones
of
temperature
modified
to
some
extent
by
the
rainless
plateaus
of
the
north
and
by
the
excessive
rainfall
of
the
south
in
general
terms
it
may
be
said
that
the
extremes
of
temperature
are
not
so
great
as
in
corresponding
latitudes
of
the
northern
hemisphere
because
of
the
greater
expanse
of
water
in
comparison
with
the
land
areas
the
summers
being
cooler
and
the
winters
warmer
the
cold
antarctic
or
humboldt
current
sweeps
northward
along
the
coast
and
greatly
modifies
the
heat
of
the
arid
tropical
plateaus
the

central
chile
is
profoundly
affected
by
the
high
mountain
barrier
on
the
eastern
frontier
and
by
the
broad
treeless
pampas
of
argentina
which
raise
the
easterly
winds
from
the
atlantic
to
so
high
an
elevation
that
they
sweep
across
chile
without
leaving
a
drop
of
rain
at
very
rare
intervals
light
rains
fall
in
the
desert
regions
north
of
coquimbo
but
these
are
brought
by
the
prevailing
coast
winds
with
this
exception
these
regions
are
the
most
arid
on
the
face
of
the
globe
highly
heated
by
a
tropical
sun
during
the
day
and
chilled
at
night
by
the
proximity
of
heights
and
a
cold
ocean
current
going
south
the
temperature
slowly
falls
and
the
rainfall
gradually
increases
the
year
being
divided
into
a
short
rainy
season
and
a
long
dry
cloudless
season
at
copiapó
in
above
the
sea
the
mean
annual
temperature
is
and
the
rainfall
about
but
at
coquimbo
in
the
temperature
is
and
the
rainfall
in
at
santiago
in
above
the
sea
the
mean
temperature
is
and
the
annual
rainfall
though
the
latter
varies
considerably
the
number
of
rainy
days
in
the
year
averages
about
at
talca
in
and
above
the
mean
annual
temperature
is
nearly
one
degree
above
that
of
santiago
but
the
rainfall
has
increased
to
in
the
long
dry
season
of
this
region
makes
irrigation
necessary
and
vegetation
has
something
of
a
subtropical
appearance
palms
growing
naturally
as
far
south
as
the
climate
is
healthy
and
agreeable
though
the
among
the
common
people
is
abnormally
high
on
account
of
personal
habits
and
unsanitary
surroundings
in
southern
chile
the
climate
undergoes
a
radical
change
the
prevailing
winds
becoming
westerly
causing
a
long
rainy
season
with
a
phenomenal
rainfall
the
plains
as
well
as
the
western
slopes
of
the
andes
are
covered
with
forest
the
rivers
become
torrents
and
the
sky
is
covered
with
heavy
clouds
a
great
part
of
the
year
at
valdivia
in
and
near
the
the
mean
annual
temperature
is
and
the
annual
rainfall
to
with
about
rainy
days
in
the
year
these
meteorological
conditions
are
still
more
accentuated
at
ancud
at
the
north
end
of
the
island
of
chiloé
in
where
the
mean
annual
temperature
is
and
the
annual
rainfall
in
the
equable
character
of
the
climate
at
this
point
is
shown
by
the
limited
range
between
its
summer
and
winter
temperatures
the
mean
for
january
being
and
the
mean
for
july
the
almost
continual
cloudiness
is
undoubtedly
a
principal
cause
not
only
of
the
low
summer
temperatures
but
also
of
the
comparatively
high
winter
temperatures
frosts
are
infrequent
and
snow
does
not
lie
long
the
climate
is
considered
to
be
healthful
notwithstanding
the
excessive
humidity
the
of
coast
from
the
chonos
archipelago
south
to
the
fuegian
islands
have
a
climate
closely
approximating
that
of
the
latter
it
is
wet
and
stormy
all
the
year
through
though
the
rainfall
is
much
less
than
that
of
ancud
and
valdivia
the
line
of
perpetual
snow
which
is
above
between
lat
and
descends
to
to
in
tierra
del
fuego
affording
another
indication
of
the
low
maximum
temperatures
ruling
during
the
summer
at
the
extreme
south
where
chilean
territory
extends
across
to
the
atlantic
entrance
to
the
straits
of
magellan
a
new
climatic
influence
is
encountered
in
the
warm
equatorial
current
flowing
down
the
east
coast
of
south
america
which
gives
to
eastern
tierra
del
fuego
a
higher
temperature
than
that
of
the
western
shore
the
andes
although
much
broken
in
these
latitudes
also
exert
a
modifying
influence
on
these
eastern
districts
sheltering
them
from
the
cold
westerly
storms
and
giving
them
a
drier
climate
this
accounts
for
the
surprising
meteorological
data
obtained
from
punta
arenas
in
where
the
mean
annual
temperature
is
and
the
annual
rainfall
only
in
other
observations
reduce
this
annual
precipitation
to
less
than
in
according
to
observations
made
by
the
swedish
antarctic
expedition
at
orange
bay
hoste
island
in
lat
long
which
is
more
exposed
to
the
westerly
storms
the
mean
temperature
for
months
was
and
the
total
precipitation
rain
and
snow
in
the
mean
maximum
temperature
was
and
the
mean
minimum
the
observations
showed
days
with
rain
or
snow
of
which
were
with
snow
the
indigenous
flora
of
chile
is
less
extensive
and
less
interesting
than
those
of
argentina
and
brazil
but
contains
many
peculiar
genera
and
species
a
classification
of
this
flora
necessitates
its
division
into
at
least
three
general
zones
the
desert
provinces
of
the
north
central
chile
and
the
humid
regions
of
the
south
the
first
is
an
arid
desert
absolutely
barren
along
part
of
the
coast
between
tacna
and
copiapó
but
with
a
coarse
scanty
vegetation
near
the
cordilleras
along
watercourses
and
on
the
slopes
where
moisture
from
the
melting
snows
above
percolates
through
the
sand
in
the
valleys
of
the
copiapó
and
huasco
rivers
a
meagre
vegetation
is
to
be
found
near
their
channels
apart
from
what
is
produced
by
irrigation
but
the
surface
of
the
plateau
and
the
dry
river
channels
below
the
sierras
are
completely
barren
continuing
southward
into
the
province
of
coquimbo
a
gradual
change
in
the
arid
conditions
may
be
observed
the
higher
summits
of
the
cordilleras
afford
a
larger
and
more
continuous
supply
of
water
and
so
dependent
are
the
people
in
the
cultivated
river
valleys
on
this
source
of
water
supply
that
they
watch
for
snowstorms
in
the
cordilleras
as
an
indication
of
what
the
coming
season
is
to
be
the
arborescent
growth
near
the
mountains
is
larger
and
more
vigorous
in
which
are
to
be
found
the
algarrobo
and
chañar
but
the
only
shrub
to
be
found
on
the
coast
is
a
species
of
near
the
sierras
where
irrigation
is
possible
is
so
successful
especially
the
grape
and
fig
that
the
product
is
considered
the
best
in
chile
in
regard
to
the
indigenous
flora
of
this
region
john
ball
says
the
species
which
grow
here
are
the
more
or
less
modified
representatives
of
plants
which
at
some
former
period
existed
under
very
different
conditions
of
life
proceeding
southward
cacti
become
common
first
a
dwarfed
species
and
then
a
larger
columnar
form
the
streams
are
fringed
with
willows
fruit
trees
and
alfalfa
fields
fill
the
irrigated
valleys
and
the
lower
mountain
slopes
are
better
covered
with
a
thorny
arborescent
growth
the
divides
between
the
streams
however
continue
barren
as
far
south
as
the
transverse
ranges
of
mountains
across
the
province
of
aconcagua
to
some
degree
the
flora
of
central
chile
is
of
a
transition
character
between
the
northern
and
southern
zones
it
is
much
more
than
this
however
for
it
has
a
large
number
of
genera
and
species
peculiarly
its
own
a
large
majority
of
the
genera
peculiar
to
the
south
american
temperate
regions
belong
exclusively
to
central
chile
this
zone
extends
from
about
the
to
the
parallel
perhaps
a
little
farther
south
to
include
some
characteristic
types
the
evergreens
largely
predominate
here
as
well
as
in
the
extreme
south
and
on
the
open
sunburnt
plains
the
vegetation
takes
on
a
subtropical
aspect
one
of
the
most
characteristic
trees
of
this
zone
is
the
whose
dense
evergreen
foliage
is
everywhere
conspicuous
the
is
another
characteristic
evergreen
tree
of
this
region
whose
bark
possesses
saponaceous
properties
in
earlier
times
the
coquito
palm
was
to
be
found
throughout
this
part
of
chile
but
it
has
been
almost
completely
destroyed
for
its
saccharine
sap
from
which
a
treacle
was
made
one
of
the
most
striking
forest
trees
is
the
or
chilean
pine
which
often
grows
to
a
height
of
and
is
prized
by
the
natives
for
its
fruit
three
indigenous
species
of
the
beech
the
and
are
widely
diffused
and
highly
prized
for
their
wood
especially
the
first
which
is
misleadingly
called
oak
most
of
the
woods
used
in
construction
and
manufactures
are
found
between
the
river
and
the
taytao
peninsula
among
which
are
the
or
chiloé
cypress
the
chilean
cypress
laurel
and
many
others
several
exotic
species
have
been
introduced
into
this
part
of
chile
some
of
which
have
thriven
even
better
than
in
their
native
habitats
among
these
are
the
oak
elm
beech
walnut
chestnut
poplar
willow
and
eucalyptus
through
the
central
zone
the
plains
are
open
and
there
are
forests
on
the
mountain
slopes
but
in
the
southern
zone
there
are
no
plains
with
the
exception
of
small
areas
near
the
straits
of
magellan
and
the
forests
are
universal
in
the
variety
size
and
density
of
their
growth
these
forests
remind
one
of
the
tropics
they
are
made
up
in
great
part
of
the
evergreen
beech
the
deciduous
antarctic
beech
and
winter
bark
intermingled
with
a
dense
undergrowth
composed
of
a
great
variety
of
shrubs
and
plants
among
which
are
magellanica
arbutus
rigida
myrtus
two
or
three
species
of
wild
currant
a
trailing
blackberry
tree
ferns
grasses
and
innumerable
parasites
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
cordillera
in
the
extreme
south
the
climate
is
drier
and
open
and
grassy
plains
are
found
but
on
the
western
side
the
dripping
forests
extend
from
an
altitude
of
to
down
to
the
level
of
the
sea
a
peculiar
vegetable
product
of
this
inclement
region
is
a
small
globular
fungus
growing
on
the
bark
of
the
beech
which
is
a
staple
article
of
food
among
the
fuegians
probably
the
only
instance
where
a
fungus
is
the
bread
of
a
people
it
is
generally
conceded
that
the
potato
originated
in
southern
chile
as
it
is
found
growing
wild
in
chiloé
and
neighbouring
islands
and
on
the
adjacent
mainland
the
strawberry
is
also
indigenous
to
these
latitudes
on
both
sides
of
the
andes
and
chile
is
credited
with
a
species
from
which
the
cultivated
strawberry
derives
some
of
its
best
qualities
maize
and
quinoa
were
known
in
chile
before
the
arrival
of
europeans
but
it
is
not
certain
that
they
are
indigenous
species
of
the
bean
and
pepper
plant
are
also
indigenous
and
the
former
is
said
to
have
been
cultivated
by
the
natives
among
the
many
economic
plants
which
have
been
introduced
into
chile
and
have
become
important
additions
to
her
resources
the
more
prominent
are
wheat
barley
hemp
and
alfalfa
together
with
the
staple
european
fruits
such
as
the
apple
pear
peach
nectarine
grape
fig
olive
and
orange
the
has
also
been
introduced
into
the
southern
provinces
of
the
desert
region
among
the
marine
productions
on
the
southern
coast
a
species
of
kelp
merits
special
mention
because
of
its
extraordinary
length
its
habit
of
clinging
to
the
rocks
in
strong
currents
and
turbulent
seas
and
its
being
a
shelter
for
innumerable
species
of
marine
animals

rich
in
species
and
highly
interesting
in
its
varied
forms

characteristics
the
northern
coast
has
no
sheltered
waters
of
any
considerable
extent
and
the

slopes
abruptly
to

a
species
of
codfish
possibly
differing
in
some
particulars
from
the

both
of
which
are
caught
for

still
another

but
a
more
thorough
survey
of
the
uninhabited
territories
of

south
may
increase
this
list
there

no
alligators
in

in
a
region
so
filled
with

as
the
rainy
south
only
two
species
of
batrachians
the
insect
life
of
these
strangely
associated
regions
is
likewise
greatly
restricted
by
adverse
climatic
conditions
a
considerable
part
of
the
northern

climate
of

unfavourable

the
population
of
chile
is
largely
concentrated
in
the
twelve
agricultural
provinces
between

including
coquimbo
and
concepción
though
the
next
six
provinces
to
the
south
of
more
recent
general
settlement
have
received
some
foreign
immigrants
and
are
rapidly
growing
in
the
desert
provinces
the
population
is
limited
to
the

and
to

in

to
its
mining

a
considerable
number
of
agriculturists
located
in
a
few
irrigated

which
class
is
largely
increased
in
the
adjoining
province
of
coquimbo
the
more
northern
provinces
however
maintain
their
populations
without
the
support
of
such
small
cultivated
areas
in
the
southern
territories
unfavourable
conditions
of
a
widely
different
character
prevail
and
the
population
is
restricted
to
a
few
small
settlements
and
some
nomadic
tribes

here
however
there
are
localities
where
settlements
could
be
maintained
by
ordinary
means
and
the
population
could
be
greatly
increased
since
the
census
of
the
population
of
punta

has
been
largely
increased
by
the
discovery
of
gold
in

vicinity
the
twelve
provinces
first
mentioned
which
include
the
celebrated
vale
of
chile
comprise
only
of
the
area
of
the
republic
but
the
census
of
showed
that
of
the
total
population
was
concentrated
within
their

the
four

and
showing
an
actual
decrease
in

during
these
years
chile
held
the
anomalous
position
of
a
country
spending
large
sums
annually
to
secure
immigrants
while
at
the
same
time
her
own
labouring
classes
were
emigrating
by
thousands
to
the
neighbouring
republics
to
improve
their
condition
writing

of

that
this
emigration
then
averaged
a

and
in
bad
times
had
reached
as
many
as
in
one
year
the
condition
of
the
chilean
labourer
has
been
much
improved
since
then
however
and
chile
no
longer
suffers
so
serious
a
loss
of

this
unfavourable
state
of
affairs
is
due
to
the
poverty
ignorance
and
insanitary
habits
of
the
lower
classes
the
government
has
made
repeated
efforts
to
secure
immigrants
from
europe
but
the
lands
set
apart
for
immigrant
settlers
are
in
the
forested
provinces
south
of

the
labour
and
hardships
involved
in
establishing
a
home
are
great
and
the
protection
of
the
law
against
bandits
and
criminal
assaults
is
weak
the
germans
have
indeed
settled
in
many
parts
of
these
southern
provinces
since
and
by
keeping
together
have
succeeded
in
building
up
several
important
towns
and
a
large
number
of
prosperous
agricultural
communities
one
german
authority
hüber
estimates
the
number
of
germans
in
two
of
these
provinces
at
the
arrivals
however
have
been
on
the
whole
discouragingly
small
the
total
for
the
years
being
only
although
chileans
claim
a
comparatively
small
admixture
with
the
native
races
it
is
estimated
that
the
whites
and
creoles
of
white
extraction
do
not
exceed
to
of
the
population
while
the
form
fully
this
estimate
is
unquestionably
conservative
for
there
has
been
no
large
influx
of
european
blood
to
counterbalance
the
race
mixtures
of
earlier
times
the
estimated
number
of
indians
living
within
the
boundaries
of
chile
is
about
which
presumably
includes
the
nomadic
tribes
of
the
fuegian
archipelago
whose
number
probably
does
not
reach
the
araucanians
whose
territory
is
slowly
being
occupied
by
the
whites

concentrated
in
the
eastern
forests
of

cautin
all
that
remains
to
them
of
the
araucania
which
they
so
bravely
and
successfully
defended
for
more
than
three
centuries
their
number
does
not
much
exceed
which
is
being
steadily
reduced
by
drunkenness
and
epidemic
diseases
a
small
part
of
these
indians
live
in
settled
communities
and
include
some
very
successful
but
the
greater
part
live
apart
from
civilization
there
are
also
some
remnants
of
tribes
in
the
province
of
chiloé
which
inhabit
the
island
of
that
name
the
chonos
and
guaytecas
archipelagoes
and
the
adjacent
mainland
who
have
the
reputation
of
being
good
boatmen
and
fishermen
and
there
are
remnants
of
a
people
called
changos
on
the
desert
coast
and
traces
of
calchaqui
blood
in
the
neighbouring
andean
foothills
there
is
a
wide
difference
in
every
respect
between
the
upper
or
ruling
class
and
the
common
people
the
former
includes
the
landed
proprietors
professional
men
and
a
part
of
those
engaged
in
commercial
and
industrial
pursuits
these
educated
classes
form
only
a
small
minority
of
the
population
many
of
them
especially
the
landed
proprietors
are
descendants
of
the
original
spanish
settlers
and
are
celebrated
for
their
politeness
and
hospitality
the
political
control
of
the
republic
was
secured
to
them
by
the
constitution
of
the
common
people
were
kept
in
ignorance
and
practically
in
a
state
of
hopeless
servitude
they
were
allowed
to
occupy
small
leaseholds
on
the
large
estates
on
condition
of
performing
a
certain
amount
of
work
for
the
landlord
every
avenue
toward
the
betterment
of
their
condition
was
practically
closed
the
condition
of
the
itinerant
labourers
was
still
worse
the
wages
paid
them
being
hardly
sufficient
to
keep
them
from
starvation
the
chilean
however
comes
from
a
hardy
stock
and
has
borne
all
these
hardships
with
a
fortitude
and
patience
which
go
far
to
counterbalance
his
faults
recent
reforms
in
education
together
with
the
growth
of
manufacturing
industries
are
slowly
leading
to
improvements
in
the
material
condition
of
the
common

the
political
organization
of
the
country
has
not
been
favourable
to
the

scientific
tastes
though
chile
has
produced
political

the
population
is
not
concentrated

large

is
well
distributed
through
the
cultivated
parts
of
the
country
the
large
number
of
small

important
as
ports
market
towns
or
manufacturing

is
a
natural
result
many
of
the
foregoing
towns
are
only
villages
in
size
but
their
importance
is
not
to
be
measured
in
this

arica
is
one
of
the
oldest
ports
on
the
coast
and
has
long
been
a
favoured
port
for

trade
because
the

cordilleras
at

point
are
not

difficult
moreover
the
railway
from

to

will
still
further
add
to
its
importance
though
it
may
not
greatly
increase
its

that
of
vichuquen
province
of
curicó
situated
on
a

on

the
centre

that
of

is
increasing
again
through

railway
construction
in

from
when
work
was
begun
on
a
short
line
between
copiapó
and
the
port
of
caldera
in
the
atacama
desert
region
since
then
lines
have
been
built
by
private
companies
from
the
coast
at
several
points
to
inland
mining
centres
one
of
these
running
from
antofagasta
to
the
caracoles
district
was
afterwards
extended
to
oruro
bolivia
and
has
become
a
commercial
route
of
international
importance
with
a
total
length
of
of
which
are
in
chile
it
should
be
remembered
that
many
of
these
railway
enterprises
of
the
desert
region
originated
at
a
time
when
the
territory
belonged
to
bolivia
and
peru
the
first
railway
to
be
constructed
in
central
chile
was
the
government
line
from
valparaiso
to
santiago
in
length
which
was
opened
to
traffic
in
about
the
same
time
the
government
began
the
construction
of
a
longitudinal
trunk
line
running
southward
from
santiago
midway
between
the
andes
and
the
coast
range
and
connecting
with
all
the
provincial
capitals
and
prominent
ports
this
is
the
only
railway
system
it
is
possible
for
chile
to
have
the
civil
war
of
called
attention
to
the
need
of
a
similar
inland
route
through
the
northern
provinces
a
branch
of
the
valparaiso
and
santiago
line
runs
to
los
andes
and
its
extension
across
the
andes
connects
with
the
argentine
lines
from
buenos
aires
to
mendoza
and
the
chilean
frontier
all
sections
together
forming
a
transcontinental
route
about
in
length
the
transandine
section
of
this
route
crosses
the
cordillera
through
the
uspallata
pass
a
further
transandine
scheme
provides
for
a
line
through
the
pino
hachado
pass
to

the
argentine
great
southern
company
obtained
a
concession
in
to
extend
its
neuquen
line
to
the
frontier

a
total
mileage

the
most
part

the

route
there

are

many
of

open
coast
others
are
on
shallow
bays
and
obstructed
and
some
are
harbours
among
the
channels
and
islands
of
the
south
the
prosperity
of
chile
is
intimately
connected
with
her
trade
and
no
elaborate
system
of
national
railway
lines
and
domestic
manufactures
can
ever
change
this
relationship
these
conditions
should
have
developed
a
large
merchant
marine
but
the
chileans
are
not
traders
and
are
sailors
only
in
a
military
sense
in
their
merchant
marine
consisted
of
only
vessels
of
which
were
steamers
of
tons
net
and
were
sailing
vessels
of

nineteen
of
the
steamers
belonged
to
a
subsidized
national
line
whose
west
coast
service
once
extended
to
san
francisco
california
and
a
large
part
of
the
others
belongs
to
a

the
foreign
commerce
of
the
republic
is
carried
chiefly
by
foreign
vessels
and
the
coasting
trade
is
also
open
to
them
three
or
four
foreign
companies
maintain
a
regular
steamship
service
to
valparaiso
and
other
chilean
ports
the

very
nearly
this

a

and
about

in
the
aggregate
the
commerce
of
chile
is
large
and
important
in
proportion
to
population
it
is
exceeded
among
south
american
states
only
by
argentina

unlike

it

what
may
be
called
central
chile
is
singularly
well
adapted
to
agriculture
the
northern
part
of
this
region
has
a
climate
light
rainfall
and
a
long
dry
summer
but
with
irrigation
it
produces
a
great
variety
of
products
alfalfa
or
lucerne
is
grown
extensively
for
shipment
to
the
mining
towns
of
the
desert
provinces
there
were
no
less
than
acres
devoted
to
it
in
a
considerable
part
of
which
was
in
the
irrigated
river
valleys
of
coquimbo
and
aconcagua
considerable
attention
is
also
given
to
fruit
cultivation
in
these
subtropical
provinces
where
the
orange
lemon
fig
melon
pineapple
and
banana
are
produced
with
much
success
some
districts
especially
in
coquimbo
have
gained
a
high
reputation
for
the
excellence
of
their
preserved
fruits
the
vine
is
cultivated
all
the
way
from
atacama
and
coquimbo
where
excellent
raisins
are
produced
south
to
concepción
where
some
of
the
best
wines
of
chile
are
manufactured
in
there
were
acres
devoted
to
grape
production
in
this
region
the
product
for
that
year
being
gallons
of
wine
and
gallons
of
brandy
the
universal
beverage
of
the
people
is
made
from
indian
corn
although
wheat
is
produced
in
the
northern
part
of
this
region
it
is
grown
with
greater
success
in
the
south
where
the
rainfall
is
heavier
and
the
average
temperature
is
lower
there
were
acres
devoted
to
this
cereal
in
which
produced
bushels
or
an
average
of
bushels
of
lb
to
the
acre
in
the
production
was
increased
to
bushels
but
in
it
fell
off
to
bushels
at
one
time
chile
supplied
argentina
and
the
entire
west
coast
as
far
north
as
california
with
wheat
but
argentina
and
california
have
become
wheat
producers
and
exporters
and
chile
has
been
driven
from
all
her
old
consuming
markets
great
britain
is
now
her
best
customer
and
brazil
takes
a
small
quantity
for
milling
mixtures
chile
has
been
badly
handicapped
by
her
crude
methods
of
cultivation
but
these
are
passing
away
and
modern
methods
are
taking
their
place
formerly
wheat
was
grown
chiefly
in
the
region
of
long
rainless
summers
and
the
ripened
grain
was
thrown
upon
uncovered
earth
floors
and
threshed
by
horses
driven
about
over
the
straw
but
this
antiquated
process
was
not
suited
to
the
climate
and
enterprise
of
the
more
southern
provinces
and
the
modern
has
been
introduced
barley
is
largely
produced
chiefly
for
home
consumption
maize
indian
corn
is
grown
in
every
part
of
chile
except
the
rainy
south
where
the
grain
can
not
ripen
and
is
a
principal
article
of
food
the
green
maize
furnishes
two
popular
national
dishes
and
which
are
eaten
by
both
rich
and
poor
potatoes
also
are
widely
cultivated
but
the
humid
regions
of
the
south
particularly
from
valdivia
to
chiloé
produce
the
greatest
quantity
the
total
annual
production
exceeds
three
million
bushels
the
kidney
bean
is
another
staple
product
in
every
part
of
the
country
and
is
perhaps
the
most
popular
article
of
food
among
all
classes
of
chileans
peas
are
largely
cultivated
south
of
the
maule
walnuts
have
become
another
important
product
and
are
exported
the
average
annual
produce
being
to
bushels
the
olive
was
introduced
from
spain
in
colonial
times
and
is
widely
distributed
through
the
north
central
provinces
but
its
economic
importance
is
not
great
of
the
european
fruits
introduced
into
the
southern
provinces
the
apple
has
been
the
most
successful
it
grows
with
little
care
and
yields
even
better
than
in
its
original
home
the
peach
apricot
plum
quince
and
cherry
are
also
cultivated
with
success
wild
strawberries
are
found
on
both
sides
of
the
andes
the
cultivated
varieties
are
unsurpassed
especially
those
of
the
province
of
concepción
the
pastoral
industries
of
chile
have
been
developed
chiefly
for
the
home
market
the
climate
is
admirably
suited
to
as
the
winters
are
mild
and
pasture
is
to
be
found
throughout
the
whole
year
but
the
proximity
of
the
argentine
pampas
is
fatal
to
its
profitable
development
the
government
has
been
trying
to
promote
by
levying
duties
as
high
as
pesos
a
head
on
cattle
imported
from
argentina
but
with
no
great
success
the
importation
which
formerly
numbered
about
per
annum
still
numbers
not
far
from
head
there
are
some
districts
in
central
chile
where
is
the
principal
occupation
but
the
long
dry
summers
limit
the
pasturage
on
the
open
plains
and
prevent
the
development
which
perhaps
would
otherwise
result
as
in
argentina
beef
is
generally
dried
in
the
sun
to
make
jerked
beef
in
which
form
it
is
exported
to
the
desert
provinces
horse
and
mule
breeding
are
carried
on
to
a
limited
extent
and
since
the
opening
of
the
far
south
more
attention
has
been
given
to
sheep
goats
and
swine
are
raised
in
small
numbers
on
the
large
estates
but
in
chiloé
is
one
of
the
chief
occupations
of
the
people
some
attention
has
been
given
to
the
production
of
butter
and
cheese
but
the
industry
has
attained
no
great
importance
a
new
industry
which
has
made
noteworthy
progress
however
is
that
of
which
is
greatly
favoured
by
the
mild
climate
and
the
long
season
and
abundance
of
flowers
the
manufacturing
interests
of
chile
have
become
influential
enough
to
force
a
high
tariff
policy
upon
the
country
they
have
been
restricted
principally
to
articles
of
necessity
food
preparations
beverages
textiles
and
wearing
apparel
leather
and
leatherwork
woodwork
pottery
chemicals
ironware
in
earlier
days
when
chile
had
less
competition
in
the
production
of
wheat
flour
mills
were
to
be
found
everywhere
in
the
provinces
and
flour
was
one
of
the
leading
exports
concepción
talca
and
other
provincial
capitals
developed
important
milling
industries
which
were
extended
to
all
the
chief
towns
of
the
newer
provinces
south
of
the
there
are
over
large
flour
mills
in
chile
the
greater
part
of
which
are
equipped
with
modern
machinery
the
development
of
the
coal
deposits
in
the
provinces
of
concepción
and
arauco
has
made
possible
other
industries
besides
those
of
smelting
mineral
ores
and
numerous
small
manufacturing
establishments
have
resulted
especially
in
santiago
valparaiso
copiapó
and
other
places
where
no
permanent
water
power
exists
tanning
leather
is
an
important
industry
especially
in
the
south
some
of
the
chilean
trees
notably
the
and
being
rich
in
tannin
to
provide
a
market
for
the
leather
produced
factories
have
been
established
for
the
manufacture
of
boots
and
shoes
harness
and
saddles
and
under
the
protection
of
a
high
tariff
are
doing
well
brewing
and
distilling
have
made
noteworthy
progress
the
domestic
consumption
of
their
products
being
very
large
the
breweries
are
generally
worked
by
germans
and
are
situated
chiefly
in
the
south
though
there
are
large
establishments
in
santiago
and
valparaiso
small
quantities
of
their
products
are
exported
furniture
and
carriage
factories
cooperages
and
other
manufactories
of
wood
are
numerous
and
generally
prosperous
there
are
likewise
a
large
number
of
factories
for
canning
and
preserving
fruits
and
vegetables
foundries
and
machine
shops
have
been
established
especially
for
the
manufacture
of
railway
material
the
sugar
beet
has
been
added
to
the
productions
of
chile
and
with
it
the
manufacture
on
a
small
scale
of
beet
sugar
there
is
one
large
refinery
at
viña
del
mar
however
which
imports
raw
cane
sugar
from
peru
for
refining
the
manufacture
of
textiles
is
carried
on
at
santiago
and
el
tomé
and
numerous
small
factories
are
devoted
to
clothing
of
various
descriptions
the
great
mining
industries
have
led
to
a
noteworthy
development
in
the
production
of
chemicals
and
a
considerable
number
of
factories
are
engaged
in
the
production
of
pharmaceutical
preparations
perfumeries
soaps
candles
c
the
most
important
of
all
the
national
industries
however
is
that
of
mining
in
there
were
registered
mines
on
which
mining
dues
were
paid
the
aggregate
produce
being
valued
at
pesos
these
mines
gave
employment
to
labourers
of
whom
were
employed
by
the
nitrate
companies
in
various
metalliferous
mines
in
coal
mines
and
in
other
mines
gold
is
found
in
nearly
all
the
provinces
from
antofagasta
to
concepción
and
in
llanquihue
chiloé
and
magallanes
territory
but
the
output
is
not
large
there
are
a
great
many
placer
washings
among
which
are
some
extensive
deposits
near
the
straits
of
magellan
silver
is
found
principally
on
the
elevated
slopes
and
plateaus
of
the
andes
in
the
desert
provinces
of
the
north
the
second
most
important
mining
industry
in
chile
however
is
that
of
copper
which
is
found
in
the
provinces
of
antofagasta
atacama
coquimbo
aconcagua
valparaiso
santiago
colchagua
curicó
and
talca
but
the
richest
deposits
are
in
the
three
desert
provinces
chile
was
once
the
largest
producer
of
copper
in
the
world
her
production
in
being
rated
at
to
of
the
total
low
prices
afterwards
caused
a
large
shrinkage
in
the
output
but
she
is
still
classed
among
the
principal
producers
iron
mining
has
never
been
developed
in
chile
although
extensive
deposits
are
said
to
exist
manganese
ores
are
mined
in
atacama
and
coquimbo
and
their
export
is
large
the
other
metals
reported
in
the
official
returns
are
lead
cobalt
and
vanadium
of
which
only
small
quantities
are
produced
bolivian
tin
is
exported
from
chilean
ports
among
the
minerals
are
nitrate
of
soda
borate
of
lime
coal
salt
and
sulphur
together
with
various
products
derived
from
these
minerals
such
as
iodine
sulphuric
acid
guano
is
classed
among
the
mineral
products
and
still
figures
as
an
export
though
the
richest
chilean
deposits
were
exhausted
long
before
the
war
with
peru
of
products
nitrate
of
soda
is
by
far
the
most
important
extensive
deposits
of
the
salt
called
in
its
crude
impure
state
in
the
provinces
of
tacna
tarapacá
antofagasta
and
atacama
owe
their
existence
to
the
rainless
character
of
the
climate
those
of
the
province
have
been
discovered
since
the
war
between
chile
and
peru
and
have
greatly
extended
the
prospective
life
of
the
industry
the
nitrate
fields
which
lie
between
and
from
the
coast
and
at
elevations
exceeding
above
have
been
officially
estimated
at
hectares
sq
and
to
contain
millions
of
metric
quintals
short
tons
the
first
export
of
nitrates
was
in
and
in
it
reached
an
aggregate
of
tons
and
in
of
tons
the
latter
figure
is
apparently
about
the
production
agreed
upon
between
the
chilean
government
and
the
nitrate
companies
to
prevent
overproduction
and
a
resulting
decline
in
price
nearly
all
the
or
working
plants
are
owned
and
operated
by
british
companies
and
the
railways
of
this
desolate
region
are
generally
owned
by
the
same
companies
and
form
a
part
of
the
working
plant
borate
of
lime
also
furnishes
another
important
export
though
a
less
valuable
one
than
nitrate
of
soda
extensive
deposits
of
borax
and
common
salt
have
been
found
in
the
same
region
which
with
several
other
products
of
these
saline
deposits
such
as
iodine
add
considerably
to
its
exports
the
coal
deposits
of
chile
are
found
chiefly
in
the
provinces
of
concepción
and
arauco
the
principal
mines
being
on
the
coast
of
the
bay
of

of
punta
arenas
on

in
the
volcanic
regions
of

but
the
principal

together
with

mines
in

increased

averaged
about

passed
in

the

value
of

reduced
to

the
outstanding

should
be
redeemed
a
conversion
fund
was
also
created

although
the

afterwards
authorized
two
more
large

the
beneficial
effects
of

were
so
pronounced

shown
in

the

the
custom
of

of

of

for

up

and
of
dividing

into
separate
gold

accounts
leads
to
much
confusion
and
complication
in
the

and
is
the
cause
of
unavoidable
discrepancies
and
contradictions
in
may
the
external

of
the

aggregated
including
the

of

amounting
to

at
the

time
the
internal
debt
was
pesos
which
increases
the
funded
indebtedness
to
like
brazil
chile
has
been
careful
to
preserve
her
foreign
credit
and
though
an
average
indebtedness
of
about
per
capita
may
seem
large
for
a
nation
with
so
much
absolute
poverty
among
its
people
the
government
is
finding
no
difficulty
in
negotiating
new
loans
the
mineral
resources
of
the
country
and
the
conservative
instincts
of
the
people
being
considered
satisfactory
guarantees
according
to
official

the

of
which
pesos
were
in

of
the

as
the

and
steadily
increasing

from
import
duties
amounting
to
pesos
in
and
pesos
in
appears
to
indicate
an
encouraging
state
of
prosperity
in
the
country
although
an
average
of
pesos
a
year
nearly
in
addition
to
the
increased
prices
paid
for
home
manufactures
seems
to
be
a
very
heavy
indirect
tax
upon
so
poor
a
people
the
monetary
circulation
in
chile
consists
almost
wholly
of
paper
currency
nominally
based
on
a
gold
standard
of
per
peso
the
conversion
law
of
made
the
currency
convertible
at
this
rate
although
the
gold
peso
was
rated
at
previous
to
that
date
but
the
financial
crisis
of
caused
the
suspension
of
specie
payments
and
a
forced
issue
of
additional
paper
led
to
a
further
postponement
of
conversion
and
the
prompt
withdrawal
of
specie
from
circulation
the
paper
circulation
consists
of
national
and
bank
issues
the
former
owes
its
existence
very
largely
to
the
war
with
peru
the
civil
war
of
and
the
financial
troubles
of
on
the
of

the

this

was
largely
increased
by

balmaceda
in
on
the
of
july
the

was
suspended

was
described
as
a

raised
their
outstanding

time

for

another

authorized
and
the

still
further
postponed

in

more
general

provided
that
the
maximum

would
be
returned
to

on
the
presentation
of
the

issued
the
redemption
of
this
issue
was
guaranteed
by
a
conversion
fund
of
pesos

by
an
authorization
to

a

history
inca
conquest
chile
was
the
recognized
name
of
the
country
from
the
beginning
of
its
known
history
the
land
was
originally
inhabited
by
tribes
of
indians
who
though
not
mere
savages
were
far
below
the
level
of
civilization
distinguishing
the
races
of
mexico
and
peru
when
the
country
first
became
known
to
the
spaniards
in
the
century
the
northern
tribes
were
found
to
be
more
civilized
and
much
more
submissive
than
those
of
the
south
the
difference
was
no
doubt
due
to
the
invasion
and
conquest
of
northern
chile
in
the
century
by
yupanqui
inca
of
peru
grandfather
of
atahualpa
ruler
of
peru
at
the
time
of
its
conquest
by
pizarro
the
dominion
of
the
incas
in
chile
was
probably
bounded
by
the
rapel
river
lat
and
though
their
control
of
the
country
was
slight
the
peruvian
influence
led
to
the
introduction
of
a
higher
civilization
and
by
weakening
the
power
of
the
tribes
paved
the
way
for
the
invasion
of
the
spaniards
beyond
the
limits
of
the
inca
conquest
the
indians
of
chile
were
distinguished
by
fierce
independence
of
character
and
by
their
warlike
qualities
rude
and
ignorant
as
they
were
they
possessed
a
rough
military
organization
each
community
was
led
by
its
chief
and
in
war
the
tribes
fought
together
under
an
elected
leader
the
name
of
the
araucanians
the
most
powerful
of
the
tribes
came
to
be
applied
to
the
whole
confederation
of
indians
living
south
of
the
river
spanish
invasions
the
first
spanish
invasion
of
chile
took
place
in
when
diego
de
almagro
the
companion
and
rival
of
pizarro
in
the
conquest
of
peru
marched
into
chile
in
search
of
gold
disappointed
in
his
quest
and
meeting
with
obstinate
resistance
from
the
southern
tribes
he
returned
to
peru
with
his
whole
force
in
in
pizarro
sent
pedro
de
valdivia
to
make
a
regular
conquest
and
settlement
of
chile
valdivia
founded
santiago
the
present
capital
of
chile
in
february
and
proceeded
to
build
the
towns
of
la
serena
conceptión
villarica
imperial
valdivia
and
angol
in
order
to
secure
his
hold
on
the
country
but
the
indians
fought
desperately
for
their
independence
and
in
a
general
rising
of
the
tribes
ended
in
the
defeat
and
death
of
valdivia
and
in
the
destruction
of
most
of
his
settlements
this
was
the
beginning
of
nearly
a
century
of
continuous
warfare
as
there
was
no
gold
in
the
country
the
number
of
settlers
was
small
the
loose
tribal
organization
of
the
natives
made
it
impossible
to
inflict
a
vital
defeat
on
them
and
the
mountainous
and
thickly
wooded
country
lent
itself
admirably
to
a
warfare
of
surprises
and
ambuscades
general
after
general
and
army
after
army
were
despatched
from
spain
and
peru
chile
was
given
a
government
independent
of
the
viceroy
of
lima
attack
after
attack
was
made
on
the
indians
their
lands
were
laid
waste
and
the
struggle
was
conducted
with
merciless
ferocity
all
in
vain
settlements
and
forts
were
never
free
from
assault
and
were
taken
and
retaken
if
one
indian
army
was
destroyed
another
took
its
place
if
one
was
killed
another
was
chosen
when
defeated
the
indians
retired
to
their
forests
marshes
and
hills
recruited
their
forces
and
fell
on
the
pursuing
spaniards
in
an
attempt
was
made
by
a
jesuit
missionary
to
negotiate
a
peace
but
not
till
was
the
desperate
struggle
ended
by
the
treaty
of
quillin
which
left
the
indians
all
the
land
south
of
the
river
up
to
the
peace
was
broken
by
three
wars
in
in
and
in
the
last
ended
by
a
treaty
which
actually
gave
the
araucanians
the
right
to
have
a
minister
at
santiago
colonial
system
it
was
this
constant
warfare
with
the
indians
and
the
necessity
for
hard
continuous
work
owing
to
the
lack
of
precious
metals
in
chile
that
no
doubt
helped
to
produce
in
the
settlers
the
strength
and
hardihood
of
character
that
distinguishes
the
chileans
among
south
american
races
but
not
unnaturally
the
material
condition
of
the
country
was
the
reverse
of
prosperous
the
expenditure
far
exceeded
the
revenue
the
indian
warfare
occupied
nearly
the
whole
attention
of
the
governors
and
much
of
the
time
of
the
settlers
by
the
spanish
colonial
system
the
development
of
manufactures
was
prohibited
and
the
trade
of
the
colony
was
limited
not
only
to
spain
but
to
the
one
port
of
cadiz
till
the
century
ships
were
not
allowed
to
sail
round
cape
horn
so
that
the
chileans
had
to
trade
indirectly
through
peru
and
the
argentine
agriculture
was
the
one
resource
of
the
colony
and
wheat
was
grown
for
export
to
peru
but
the
land
was
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
a
few
big
landowners
and
the
cultivation
of
the
vine
and
olive
was
forbidden
at
the
end
of
the
century
santiago
was
a
town
of
poor
houses
and
had
only
inhabitants
the
other
towns
valparaiso
concepción
la
serena
were
only
large
villages
books
were
not
allowed
to
be
imported
and
education
was
limited
to
such
as
was
given
here
and
there
by
priests
and
monks
the
indians
within
the
limits
of
the
spanish
colony
were
treated
like
slaves
and
horribly
mutilated
to
prevent
their
escape
but
at
the
same
time
a
gradual
fusion
of
races
was
taking
place
and
the
chilean
peasant
of
is
as
much
of
indian
as
of
spanish
descent
the
araucanians
however
continued
to
preserve
their
independence
they
jealously
resented
the
introduction
of
spanish
influence
and
the
missionary
efforts
of
the
jesuits
met
with
little
success
during
the
century
the
condition
of
the
colony
was
improved
in
many
ways
the
bourbon
kings
of
spain
were
more
liberal
in
their
colonial
policy
were
allowed
to
sail
direct
to
chile
trade
with
france
was
sometimes
permitted
and
a
large
batch
of
hardy
emigrants
was
sent
out
from
the
biscay
provinces
of
spain
freed
from
the
preoccupation
of
the
indian
wars
the
governors
gave
more
attention
to
the
general
welfare
of
the
country
a
university
was
started
in
santiago
in
many
towns
were
built
about
the
same
time
agriculture
and
industries
were
promoted
and
a
coasting
trade
grew
up
in
charles
iii
threw
open
all
the
ports
of
spain
to
the
colonies
and
allowed
freedom
of
trade
with
france
but
in
general
the
administration
of
the
colony
was
burdensome
oppressive
and
inefficient
the
people
had
no
voice
in
the
government
ruling
with
the
help
of
the
royal
audience
the
governor
was
absolute
master
of
the
country
and
regulated
the
smallest
details
of
life
such
time
as
the
officials
could
spare
from
the
main
object
of
enriching
themselves
by
extortion
and
corruption
was
given
up
to
endless
official
and
religious
ceremonies
and
to
petty
disputes
of
etiquette
and
precedence
all
the
high
posts
and
offices
were
filled
by
men
sent
from
spain
with
the
result
that
bitter
jealousy
reigned
between
them
and
the
colonists
the
as
a
rule
filled
the
posts
in
the
municipalities
disposed
of
by
sale
so
that
when
the
revolution
broke
out
the
naturally
became
the
centres
of
the
movement
as
in
all
spanish
colonies
so
in
chile
the
church
played
a
large
part
in
the
public
life
chile
was
divided
into
the
two
bishoprics
of
santiago
and
concepción
and
the
church
managed
to
accumulate
most
of
the
wealth
of
the
country
at
the
same
time
the
monks
and
jesuits
did
useful
work
in
teaching
industrial
and
agricultural
arts
and
in
giving
the
people
a
certain
degree
of
education
but
the
influence
of
the
church
was
used
to
bolster
up
the
traditional
narrow
colonial
system
and
the
constant
quarrels
between
the
clergy
and
the
secular
powers
often
threw
the
country
into
confusion
at
the
opening
of
the
century
chile
was
a
colony
whose
resources
had
hardly
been
touched
with
a
population
of
about
persons
of
spanish
and
mixed
spanish
and
indian
blood
a
people
endowed
with
the
vigour
of
character
bred
by
a
mountainous
country
and
a
bracing
climate
and
by
a
hard
struggle
for
existence
but
ignorant
through
lack
of
education
shut
out
by
a
commercial
system
from
knowledge
of
the
outside
world
and
destitute
of
the
that
free
institutions
afford
struggle
for
independence
the
national
independence
of
chile
dates
from
the
second
decade
of
the
century
the
revolt
of
england
north
american
colonies
and
the
events
of
the
french
revolution
naturally
suggested
the
idea
of
a
struggle
for
independence
to
the
spanish
colonists
and
the
deposition
of
ferdinand
vii
by
napoleon
and
the
ensuing
disorganization
of
spain
supplied
the
desired
opportunity
in
risings
took
place
in
venezuela
in
ecuador
in
upper
peru
and
in
the
argentine
the
revolutionary
fever
spread
to
chile
and
on
the
of
september
the
of
santiago
secured
the
resignation
of
the
governor
and
vested
his
powers
in
an
elected
board
of
seven
members
this
event
was
the
beginning
of
the
independence
of
chile
but
it
was
some
time
before
independence
was
fully
attained
the
mass
of
the
people
were
ignorant
intercourse
between
them
was
slight
and
there
was
a
strong
section
attached
to
the
old
régime
the
party
determined
on
independence
was
at
first
small
and
compelled
to
conceal
its
aims
till
the
ground
had
been
prepared
for
open
decisive
action
further
there
were
divisions
between
the
patriots
of
santiago
and
those
of
concepción
and
bitter
jealousies
between
the
leaders
the
chief
of
whom
were
juan
martinez
de
rozas
josé
miguel
carrera
and
bernardo
owing
to
the
apathy
of
the
people
and
the
enmities
existing
among
the
leaders
the
spanish
forces
sent
by
the
viceroy
of
peru
to
crush
the
revolutionary
movement
succeeded
after
two
years
indecisive
fighting
in
completely
defeating
the
patriots
at
rancagua
in
for
three
years
the
spaniards
maintained
their
hold
on
chile
ruling
the
country
with
tyrannical
harshness
but
in
the
spring
of
a
patriot
force
which
had
been
organized
at
mendoza
in
the
argentine
by
josé
de
san
martin
an
argentine
officer
and
by
crossed
the
andes
and
overwhelmed
the
royalists
at
the
battle
of
chacabuco
was
named
of
chile
while
san
martin
realizing
that
the
independence
of
each
colony
depended
on
the
spanish
being
expelled
from
the
whole
of
south
america
set
about
preparing
an
invasion
of
peru
the
viceroy
of
lima
made
one
more
effort
to
uphold
the
power
of
spain
in
chile
but
the
army
he
despatched
under
mariano
osorio
the
victor
of
rancagua
was
decisively
defeated
at
the
river
maipo
on
the
of
april
by
this
battle
the
independence
of
chile
formally
proclaimed
by
in
the
previous
february
was
finally
secured
the
republic
the
next
few
years
witnessed
the
expulsion
of
the
royalists
from
the
south
of

the
equipment
of
a
small
fleet
placed
under
the
command
of

and
the
invasion
of
peru
by
san
martin
with
the
help
of
the
fleet
ending
in
the
proclamation
of
peruvian
independence
in
though
the
spanish
power
was
not
finally
broken
until
bolivar
victory
at
ayacucho
in
relieved
from
all
fear
of
spanish
attacks
from
the
north
the
new
republic
of
chile
entered
upon
a
period
of
internal
confusion
and
dissension
bordering
upon
anarchy
as
soon
as
the
necessity
for
establishing
a
stable
government
arose
the
lack
of
training
in
among
the
chileans
became
painfully
obvious
as
rightly
perhaps
considered
that
firm
orderly
government
was
more
important
than
the
concession
of
liberal
institutions
but
his
administration
roused
strong
hostility
and
in
he
was
compelled
to
resign
from
that
date
up
to
there
were
no
less
than
ten
governments
while
three
different
constitutions
were
proclaimed
the
nation
was
divided
into
small
mutually
hostile
parties
there
were
ecclesiastical
troubles
owing
to
the
hostility
of
the
church
to
the
new
republic
there
were
indian
risings
in
the
south
and
royalist
revolts
in
the
island
of
chiloé
the
expenditure
exceeded
the
revenue
and
the
employment
of
the
old
spanish
financial
expedients
naturally
increased
the
general
discontent
up
to
the
liberal
party
which
favoured
a
free
democratic
régime
held
the
upper
hand
but
in
that
year
the
conservatives
backed
by
a
military
rising
led
by
general
joaquin
prieto
placed
themselves
in
power
after
a
sanguinary
battle
at
lircay
prieto
was
elected
president
in
and
a
new
constitution
was
drafted
and
promulgated
in
which
with
some
modifications
remains
the
constitution
of
chile
at
the
present
time
this
constitution
invested
the
executive
with
almost
dictatorial
powers
and
the
conservatives
entered
upon
a
long
term
of
office
the
aim
of
the
conservative
policy
was
to
secure
above
all
a
strong
administration
power
was
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
a
small
circle
public
liberties
were
restricted
and
all
opposition
crushed
by
force
inaugurated
under
general
prieto
administration
by
his
able
minister
diego
portales
this
policy
was
continued
by
his
successors
general
manuel
bulnes
and
manuel
montt
each
of
whom
like
prieto
was
elected
to
a
double
term
of
office
in
spite
of
the
discontent
of
the
liberals
the
conservative
ascendancy
secured
a
long
period
of
firm
stable
government
which
was
essential
to
put
an
end
to
the
confusion
in
public
life
and
to
give
time
for
the
people
to
awake
to
a
fuller
realization
of
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
national
independence
the
internal
peace
of
the
country
was
only
disturbed
three
times
by
liberal
risings
in
in
and
in
all
of
which
were
crushed
but
not
without
severe
fighting
in
chile
also
became
involved
in
a
war
with
a
confederation
of
peru
and
bolivia
which
ended
in
the
victory
of
chile
and
the
dissolution
of
the
confederation
while
refusing
to
allow
the
people
any
share
in
or
control
over
the
government
the
conservative
leaders
devoted
themselves
to
improving
the
condition
of
the
people
and
of
the
country
and
under
their
firm
rule
chile
advanced
rapidly
in
prosperity
the
government
established
a
department
for
education
a
training
college
for
teachers
and
numerous
schools
and
libraries
literary
magazines
were
started
and
a
school
of
art
and
an
academy
of
music
founded
by
the
consolidation
of
the
foreign
debt
by
the
regular
payment
of
interest
by
the
establishment
of
several
banks
and
by
the
negotiation
of
commercial
treaties
the
financial
position
of
the
country
was
improved
internal
development
was
promoted
by
the
working
of
the
silver
mines
of
copiapo
and
the
coal
mines
of
lota
by
the
building
of
railways
and
erection
of
telegraphs
and
by
the
colonization
of
the
rich
valdivia
province
with
german
settlers
the
straits
of
magellan
were
occupied
under
an
american
engineer
william
wheelwright
a
line
of
steamers
was
started
on
the
coast
and
by
a
wise
measure
allowing
merchandise
to
be
landed
free
of
duty
for
valparaiso
became
a
busy
port
and
trading
centre
while
the
demand
for
in
california
and
australia
following
upon
the
rush
for
gold
gave
a
strong
impetus
to
agriculture
a
code
of
law
was
drawn
up
and
promulgated
and
the
ecclesiastical
system
was
organized
under
an
archbishop
appointed
by
the
pope
to
montt
as
minister
under
bulnes
and
afterwards
as
president
must
be
given
the
main
credit
for
the
policy
which
laid
the
foundations
of
the
prosperity
of
chile
and
though
the
administration
was
in
many
ways
harsh
and
narrow
firm
government
rather
than
liberty
that
would
have
tended
to
anarchy
was
essential
for
the
success
of
the
young
republic
after
however
a
liberal
reaction
set
in
aided
by
divisions
in
the
conservative
party
arising
mainly
over
church
questions
successors
josé
joaquin
perez
federico
errázuriz
and
anibal
pinto
abandoned
the
repressive
policy
of
their
predecessors
invited
the
of
the
liberals
and
allowed
discontent
to
vent
itself
freely
in
popular
agitation
some
democratic
changes
were
made
in
the
constitution
notably
a
law
forbidding
the
of
a
president
and
the
gradual
and
peaceful
transition
to
a
liberal
policy
was
a
proof
of
the
progress
which
the
nation
had
made
in
political
training
outside
the
movement
for
constitutional
reform
the
most
important
internal
question
was
the
successful
liberal
attack
on
the
privileged
position
and
narrow
views
of
the
church
which
led
to
the
birth
of
a
strong
party
among
the
clergy
the
government
continued
to
be
animated
by
a
progressive
spirit
schools
railways
telegraphs
were
rapidly
extended
a
steamship
mail
service
to
europe
was
subsidized
and
the
stability
of
the
government
enabled
it
to
raise
new
foreign
loans
in
order
to
extinguish
the
old
high
loans
and
to
meet
the
expenses
of
public
works
in
a
financial
crisis
occurred
met
by
the
emission
of
paper
money
but
the
depression
was
only
temporary
and
the
country
soon
rallied
from
the
effects
during
this
period
there
was
desultory
fighting
with
the
indians
there
was
a
long
boundary
dispute
with
the
argentine
settled
in
and
in
chilean
sympathy
with
peru
in
a
quarrel
with
spain
led
to
a
foolish
war
with
spain
the
blockade
of
their
ports
and
the
bombardment
of
valparaiso
by
a
spanish
squadron
impressed
the
chileans
with
the
necessity
of
possessing
an
adequate
fleet
to
defend
their
long
and
it
was
under
president
errázuriz
that
the
ships
were
obtained
and
the
officers
trained
that
did
such
good
service
in
the
great
war
with
peru
with
a
population
of
over
two
millions
a
rapidly
increasing
revenue
ruled
by
a
government
that
was
firm
and
progressive
and
that
enjoyed
the
confidence
of
all
classes
chile
was
well
equipped
for
the
struggle
with
peru
that
began
in
close
of
the
war
with
peru
the
war
of
between
chile
and
peru
is
the
subject
of
a
separate
article
see
war
by
the
beginning
of
the
war
had
reached
a
stage
when
the
final
struggle
was
close
at
hand
on
the
of
january
of
that
year
the
chilean
forces
under
command
of
general
baquedano
attacked
the
entrenched
positions
of
the
peruvians
at
daybreak
in
the
vicinity
of
chorillos
a
village
some
few
miles
from
lima
and
forming
the
outer
line
of
defence
for
the
capital
after
a
stubborn
fight
the
day
ended
in
victory
for
the
attacking
forces
but
the
losses
on
both
sides
were
great
and
on
the
following
day
negotiations
for
peace
were
attempted
by
the
representatives
of
the
foreign
powers
in
lima
the
object
being
to
avoid
if
possible
any
further
bloodshed
this
attempt
to
end
the
conflict
proved
however
abortive
and
on
the
of
january
at
hostilities
recommenced
in
the
neighbourhood
of
miraflores
after
severe
fighting
for
some
four
hours
the
chileans
again
proved
victorious
and
drove
the
peruvians
from
the
second
line
of
defence
back
upon
the
city
of
lima
lima
was
now
at
the
mercy
of
the
chileans
and
on
the
of
january
a
division
of
men
of
all
arms
under
the
command
of
general
cornelio
saavedra
was
sent
forward
to
occupy
the
peruvian
capital
and
restore
order
within
the
town
limits
a
portion
of
the
chilean
forces
was
shortly
afterwards
withdrawn
from
peru
and
the
army
of
occupation
remaining
in
the
conquered
country
was
in
charge
of
admiral
patricio
lynch
an
officer
who
had
been
specially
promoted
for
distinguished
services
during
the
war
president
anibal
pinto
of
chile
now
set
about
to
find
means
to
conclude
a
treaty
of
peace
with
peru
but
his
efforts
in
this
direction
were
frustrated
by
the
armed
resistance
offered
in
the
country
districts
to
the
chilean
authorities
by
the
remainder
of
the
peruvian
forces
under
command
of
general
cáceres
so
matters
continued
the
chileans
administering
on
the
seaboard
and
in
the
principal
towns
the
peruvians
maintaining
a
guerilla
warfare
in
the
mountainous
districts
of
the
interior
in
september
the
term
of
office
of
president
pinto
expired
and
he
was
succeeded
in
the
post
of
chief
executive
of
chile
by
president
domingo
santa
maria
pinto
died
three
years
later
in
valparaiso
leaving
a
memory
respected
and
admired
by
all
political
parties
in
his
country
the
name
of
pinto
will
always
occupy
a
prominent
place
in
the
annals
of
chilean
history
not
only
because
the
war
with
peru
took
place
during
his
term
of
office
but
also
on
account
of
the
fact
that
it
was
largely
due
to
the
intelligent
direction
of
all
details
by
the
president
during
the
struggle
that
the
chilean
arms
proved
so
absolutely
successful
by
land
and
sea
president
santa
maria
señor
domingo
santa
maria
who
now
acceded
to
the
presidency
of
chile
was
a
liberal
in
politics
and
had
previously
held
various
important
posts
under
the
government
under
the
rule
of
president
montt
he
had
been
an
active
member
of
the
opposition
and
involved
in
various
revolutionary
conspiracies
for
his
participation
in
these
plots
he
was
at
one
time
exiled
from
the
country
but
returned
and
received
official
employment
under
president
perez
the
principal
task
confronting
president
santa
maria
on
assuming
the
presidency
was
to
negotiate
a
treaty
of
peace
with
peru
and
provide
for
the
evacuation
of
the
chilean
army
of
occupation
the
presence
of
the
peruvian
general
cáceres
and
his
forces
in
the
interior
of
peru
prevented
for
some
two
years
the
formation
of
any
peruvian
national
administration
in
lima
with
which
the
chilean
authorities
could
deal
in
august
of
the
peruvians
were
defeated
by
the
forces
commanded
by
admiral
lynch
and
a
government
was
then
organized
under
the
leadership
of
general
iglesias
a
provisional
treaty
of
peace
was
then
drawn
up
and
signed
by
general
iglesias
and
the
chilean
representative
and
this
was
finally
ratified
by
the
chilean
and
peruvian
congresses
respectively
in
april
by
the
terms
of
this
treaty
peru
ceded
to
chile
unconditionally
the
province
of
tarapacá
and
the
provinces
of
tacna
and
arica
were
placed
under
chilean
authority
for
the
term
of
ten
years
the
inhabitants
having
then
to
decide
by
a
general
vote
whether
they
remained
a
part
of
chile
or
elected
to
belong
once
more
to
peru
in
the
event
of
the
decision
being
favourable
to
peru
a
sum
of
dollars
was
to
be
paid
by
peru
to
chile
on
the
ratification
of
this
treaty
the
chilean
forces
were
immediately
withdrawn
from
lima
and
other
points
of
occupation
in
peruvian
territory
the
government
of
bolivia
also
attempted
to
negotiate
a
treaty
of
peace
with
chile
in
and
for
this
purpose
sent
representatives
to
santiago
no
satisfactory
terms
however
could
be
arranged
and
the
negotiations
ended
in
only
an
armistice
being
agreed
to
by
which
chile
remained
in
occupation
of
the
bolivian
seaboard
pending
a
definite
settlement
at
some
future
period
the
administration
of
president
santa
maria
met
with
violent
opposition
from
the
conservatives
who
included
the
clerical
party
in
their
ranks
and
also
from
a
certain
section
of
the
liberals
the
dislike
of
the
conservatives
to
president
santa
maria
was
occasioned
by
his
introduction
of
the
law
of
civil
marriage
the
civil
registration
of
births
and
deaths
and
the
freeing
of
the
cemeteries
hitherto
no
marriage
was
legal
unless
celebrated
according
to
the
rites
of
the
roman
catholic
religion
and
all
registers
of
births
and
deaths
were
kept
by
the
parish
priests
civil
employees
were
now
appointed
under
the
new
laws
to
attend
to
this
work
formerly
the
cemeteries
were
entirely
under
the
control
of
the
church
and
with
the
exception
of
a
few
places
specially
created
for
the
purpose
were
reserved
solely
for
the
burial
of
roman
catholics
under
the
new
regime
these
cemeteries
were
made
common
to
the
dead
of
all
religions
under
president
perez
in
a
clause
in
the
law
of
constitution
had
been
introduced
permitting
the
exercise
of
all
creeds
of
religion
and
this
was
now
put
into
practice
all
restrictions
being
removed
on
several
occasions
notably
in
and
president
santa
maria
used
his
influence
in
the
elections
of
senators
and
deputies
to
congress
for
the
purpose
of
creating
a
substantial
majority
in
his
favour
he
was
induced
to
take
this
course
in
consequence
of
the
violent
opposition
raised
in
the
chambers
by
the
liberal
policy
he
pursued
in
connexion
with
church
matters
this
intervention
caused
great
irritation
amongst
the
conservatives
and
dissentient
liberals
and
the
political
situation
on
more
than
one
occasion
became
so
strained
as
to
bring
the
country
to
the
verge
of
armed
revolution
no
outbreak
however
took
place
and
in
the
five
years
of
office
for
which
president
santa
maria
had
been
elected
came
to
an
end
and
another
liberal
señor
josé
manuel
balmaceda
then
succeeded
to
power
balmaceda
elected
president
revolution
of
the
election
of
balmaceda
was
bitterly
opposed
by
the
conservatives
and
dissentient
liberals
but
was
finally
successfully
carried
by
the
official
influence
exercised
by
president
santa
maria
on
assuming
office
president
balmaceda
endeavoured
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
of
all
sections
of
the
liberal
party
in
congress
and
so
form
a
solid
majority
to
support
the
administration
and
to
this
end
he
nominated
as
ministers
representatives
of
the
different
political
groups
six
months
later
the
cabinet
was
reorganized
and
two
most
bitter
opponents
to
the
recent
election
of
president
balmaceda
were
accorded
portfolios
believing
that
he
had
now
secured
the
support
of
the
majority
in
congress
on
behalf
of
any
measures
he
decided
to
put
forward
the
new
president
initiated
a
policy
of
heavy
expenditure
on
public
works
the
building
of
schools
and
the
strengthening
of
the
naval
and
military
forces
of
the
republic
contracts
were
given
out
to
the
value
of
for
the
construction
of
railways
in
the
southern
districts
some
dollars
were
expended
in
the
erection
of
schools
and
colleges
three
cruisers
and
two
torpedo
boats
were
added
to
the
squadron
the
construction
of
the
naval
port
at
talcahuano
was
actively
pushed
forward
new
armament
was
purchased
for
the
infantry
and
artillery
branches
of
the
army
and
heavy
guns
were
acquired
for
the
purpose
of
permanently
and
strongly
fortifying
the
neighbourhoods
of
valparaiso
talcahuano
and
iquique
in
itself
this
policy
was
not
unreasonable
and
in
many
ways
extremely
beneficial
for
the
country
unfortunately
corruption
crept
into
the
expenditure
of
the
large
sums
necessary
to
carry
out
this
programme
contracts
were
given
by
favour
and
not
by
merit
and
the
progress
made
in
the
construction
of
the
new
public
works
was
far
from
satisfactory
the
opposition
in
congress
to
president
balmaceda
began
to
increase
rapidly
towards
the
close
of
and
further
gained
ground
in
in
order
to
ensure
a
majority
favourable
to
his
views
the
president
threw
the
whole
weight
of
his
official
influence
into
the
elections
for
senators
and
deputies
in
but
many
of
the
members
returned
to
the
chambers
through
this
official
influence
joined
the
opposition
shortly
after
taking
their
seats
in
congress
became
distinctly
hostile
to
the
administration
of
president
balmaceda
and
the
political
situation
became
grave
and
at
times
threatened
to
involve
the
country
in
civil
war
according
to
usage
and
custom
in
chile
a
ministry
does
not
remain
in
office
unless
supported
by
a
majority
in
the
chambers
balmaceda
now
found
himself
in
the
impossible
position
of
being
unable
to
appoint
any
ministry
that
could
control
a
majority
in
the
senate
and
chamber
of
deputies
and
at
the
same
time
be
in
accordance
with
his
own
views
of
the
administration
of
public
affairs
at
this
juncture
the
president
assumed
that
the
constitution
gave
him
the
power
of
nominating
and
maintaining
in
office
any
ministers
he
might
consider
fitting
persons
for
the
purpose
and
that
congress
had
no
right
of
interference
in
the
matter
the
chambers
were
now
only
waiting
for
a
suitable
opportunity
to
assert
their
authority
in
it
was
stated
that
president
balmaceda
had
determined
to
nominate
and
cause
to
be
elected
as
his
successor
at
the
expiration
of
his
term
of
office
in
one
of
his
own
personal
friends
this
question
of
the
election
of
another
president
brought
matters
to
a
head
and
congress
refused
to
vote
supplies
to
carry
on
the
government
to
avoid
trouble
balmaceda
entered
into
a
compromise
with
congress
and
agreed
to
nominate
a
ministry
to
their
liking
on
condition
that
the
supplies
for
were
voted
this
cabinet
however
was
of
short
duration
and
resigned
when
the
ministers
understood
the
full
amount
of
friction
between
the
president
and
congress
balmaceda
then
nominated
a
ministry
not
in
accord
with
the
views
of
congress
under
señor
claudio
vicuña
whom
it
was
no
secret
that
balmaceda
intended
to
be
his
successor
in
the
presidential
chair
and
to
prevent
any
expression
of
opinion
upon
his
conduct
in
the
matter
he
refrained
from
summoning
an
extraordinary
session
of
the
legislature
for
the
discussion
of
the
estimates
of
revenue
and
expenditure
for
when
the
of
january
arrived
the
president
published
a
decree
in
the
to
the
effect
that
the
budget
of
would
be
considered
the
official
budget
for
this
act
was
illegal
and
beyond
the
attributes
of
the
executive
power
as
a
protest
against
the
action
of
president
balmaceda
the
of
the
senate
señor
waldo
silva
and
the
president
of
the
chamber
of
deputies
señor
ramon
barros
luco
issued
a
proclamation
appointing
captain
jorje
montt
in
command
of
the
squadron
and
stating
that
the
navy
could
not
recognize
the
authority
of
balmaceda
so
long
as
he
did
not
administer
public
affairs
in
accordance
with
the
constitutional
law
of
chile
the
majority
of
the
members
of
the
chambers
sided
with
this
movement
and
on
the
of
january
señores
waldo
silva
barros
luco
and
a
number
of
senators
and
deputies
embarked
on
board
the
chilean
warship
blanco
encalada
accompanied
by
the
esmeralda
and
and
other
vessels
sailing
out
of
valparaiso
harbour
and
proceeding
northwards
to
tarapaca
to
organize
armed
resistance
against
the
president
see
chilean
civil
war
it
was
not
alone
this
action
of
balmaceda
in
connexion
with
congress
that
brought
about
the
revolution
he
had
alienated
the
sympathy
of
the
aristocratic
classes
of
chile
by
his
personal
vanity
and
ambition
the
oligarchy
composed
of
the
great
landowners
have
always
been
an
important
factor
in
the
political
life
of
the
republic
when
president
balmaceda
found
that
he
was
not
a
to
this
circle
he
determined
to
endeavour
to
govern
without
their
support
and
to
bring
into
the
administration
a
set
of
men
who
had
no
traditions
and
with
whom
his
personality
would
be
the
clerical
influence
was
also
thrown
against
him
in
consequence
of
his
radical
ideas
in
respect
of
church
matters
immediately
on
the
outbreak
of
the
revolution
president
balmaceda
published
a
decree
declaring
montt
and
his
companions
to
be
traitors
and
without
delay
organized
an
army
of
some
men
for
the
suppression
of
the
insurrectionary
movement
while
both
sides
were
preparing
for
extremities
balmaceda
administered
the
government
under
dictatorial
powers
with
a
congress
of
his
own
nomination
in
june
he
ordered
the
presidential
election
to
be
held
and
señor
claudio
vicuña
was
duly
declared
chosen
as
president
of
the
republic
for
the
term
commencing
in
september
the
resources
of
balmaceda
were
running
short
on
account
of
the
heavy
military
expenses
and
he
determined
to
dispose
of
the
reserve
of
silver
bullion
accumulated
in
the
vaults
of
the
casa
de
moneda
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
law
for
the
conversion
of
the
note
issue
the
silver
was
conveyed
abroad
in
a
british
and
disposed
of
partly
for
the
purchase
of
a
fast
steamer
to
be
fitted
as
an
auxiliary
cruiser
and
partly
in
payment
for
other
kinds
of
war
material
the
organization
of
the
revolutionary
forces
went
on
slowly
much
difficulty
was
experienced
in
obtaining
the
necessary
arms
and
ammunition
a
supply
of
rifles
was
bought
in
the
united
states
and
embarked
on
board
the
itata
a
chilean
vessel
in
the
service
of
the
rebels
the
united
states
authorities
refused
to
allow
this
steamer
to
leave
san
diego
and
a
guard
was
stationed
on
the
ship
the
itata
however
slipped
away
and
made
for
the
chilean
coast
carrying
with
her
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
a
fast
cruiser
was
immediately
sent
in
pursuit
but
only
succeeded
in
overhauling
the
rebel
ship
after
she
was
at
her
destination
the
itata
was
then
forced
to
return
to
san
diego
without
landing
her
cargo
for
the
insurgents
the
necessary
arms
and
ammunition
were
arranged
for
in
europe
they
were
shipped
in
a
british
vessel
and
transferred
to
a
chilean
steamer
at
fortune
bay
in
tierra
del
fuego
close
to
the
straits
of
magellan
and
the
falkland
islands
and
thence
carried
to
iquique
where
they
were
safely
disembarked
early
in
july
a
force
of
men
was
now
raised
by
the
of
the
revolution
and
preparations
were
rapidly
pushed
forward
for
a
move
to
the
south
with
the
object
of
attacking
valparaiso
and
santiago
early
in
april
a
portion
of
the
revolutionary
squadron
comprising
the
blanco
encalada
and
other
ships
was
sent
to
the
southward
for
reconnoitring
purposes
and
put
into
the
port
of
caldera
during
the
night
of
the
of
april
and
whilst
the
blanco
encalada
was
lying
quietly
at
anchor
a
torpedo
boat
called
the
almirante
lynch
belonging
to
the
balmaceda
faction
steamed
into
the
bay
of
caldera
and
discharged
a
torpedo
at
the
rebel
ship
the
blanco
encalada
sank
in
a
few
minutes
and
of
her
crew
perished
defeat
and
suicide
of
balmaceda
in
the
middle
of
august
the
rebel
forces
were
embarked
at
iquique
where
a
provisional
government
under
captain
jorje
montt
had
been
set
up
numbering
in
all
about
men
and
sailed
for
the
south
on
the
of
august
the
congressist
army
was
disembarked
at
quinteros
about
north
of
valparaiso
and
marched
to
concon
where
the
balmacedists
were
entrenched
a
severe
fight
ensued
in
which
the
troops
of
president
balmaceda
were
defeated
with
heavy
loss
this
reverse
roused
the
worst
passions
of
the
president
and
he
ordered
the
arrest
and
imprisonment
of
all
persons
suspected
of
sympathy
with
the
revolutionary
cause
the
population
generally
were
however
distinctly
antagonistic
to
balmaceda
and
this
feeling
had
become
accentuated
since
the
of
august
on
which
date
he
had
ordered
the
execution
of
a
number
of
youths
belonging
to
the
military
college
at
san
lorenzo
on
a
charge
of
seditious
practices
the
shooting
of
these
boys
created
a
feeling
of
horror
throughout
the
country
and
a
sensation
of
uncertainty
as
to
what
measures
of
severity
might
not
be
practised
in
the
future
if
balmaceda
won
the
day
after
the
victory
at
concon
the
insurgent
army
under
command
of
general
campos
marched
in
a
southerly
direction
towards
viña
del
mar
and
thence
to
placilla
where
the
final
struggle
in
the
conflict
took
place
balmaceda
generals
barbosa
and
alcérrica
had
here
massed
their
troops
in
a
strong
position
the
battle
on
the
of
august
resulted
in
victory
for
the
rebels
both
the
balmacedist
generals
were
killed
and
valparaiso
was
at
once
occupied
three
days
later
the
victorious
insurgents
entered
santiago
and
assumed
the
government
of
the
republic
after
the
batile
of
placilla
it
was
clear
to
president
balmaceda
that
he
could
no
longer
hope
to
find
a
sufficient
strength
amongst
his
adherents
to
maintain
himself
in
power
and
in
view
of
the
rapid
approach
of
the
rebel
army
he
abandoned
his
official
duties
to
seek
an
asylum
in
the
argentine
legation
the
president
remained
concealed
in
this
retreat
until
the
of
september
on
the
evening
of
that
date
when
the
term
for
which
he
had
been
elected
president
of
the
republic
terminated
he
committed
suicide
by
shooting
himself
the
excuse
for
this
act
put
forward
in
letters
written
shortly
before
his
end
was
that
he
did
not
believe
the
conquerors
would
give
him
an
impartial
trial
the
death
of
balmaceda
finished
all
cause
of
contention
in
chile
and
was
the
closing
act
of
the
most
severe
and
bloodiest
struggle
that
country
had
ever
witnessed
in
the
various
engagements
throughout
the
conflict
more
than
lives
were
lost
and
the
joint
expenditure
of
the
two
governments
on
military
preparations
and
the
purchase
of
war
material
exceeded
sterling
an
unfortunate
occurrence
soon
after
the
close
of
the
revolution
brought
strained
relations
for
a
short
period
between
the
governments
of
the
united
states
and
chile
a
number
of
men
of
the
baltimore
having
been
given
liberty
on
shore
an
argument
arose
between
some
of
them
and
a
group
of
chilean
sailors
in
a
drinking
den
in
valparaiso
words
led
to
blows
the
americans
were
badly
handled
one
of
their
number
being
killed
and
others
severely
hurt
the
united
states
government
characterized
the
affair
as
an
outrage
demanding
an
indemnity
as
satisfaction
the
chilean
authorities
demurred
at
this
attitude
and
attempted
to
argue
the
matter
james
elaine
then
secretary
of
state
refused
peremptorily
to
listen
to
any
explanations
in
the
end
chile
paid
an
indemnity
of
as
asked
but
the
affair
left
bad
feeling
in
its
train
president
jorje
montt
the
close
of
the
revolution
against
balmaceda
left
the
government
of
chile
in
the
hands
of
the
under
whose
guidance
the
military
and
naval
operations
had
been
organized
admiral
jorje
montt
had
been
the
head
of
this
revolutionary
committee
and
he
acted
as
president
of
the
provisional
government
when
the
administration
of
the
country
changed
hands
after
the
victory
of
the
congressional
party
an
election
was
now
immediately
ordered
for
the
choice
of
a
president
of
the
republic
and
for
representatives
in
the
senate
and
chamber
of
deputies
admiral
montt
as
head
of
the
executive
power
stanchly
refused
to
allow
official
influence
to
be
brought
to
bear
in
any
way
in
the
presidential
campaign
the
great
majority
of
the
voters
however
required
no
pressure
to
decide
who
was
in
their
opinion
the
man
most
fitted
to
administer
the
affairs
of
the
republic
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
chile
a
perfectly
free
election
was
held
and
admiral
montt
was
duly
chosen
by
a
nearly
unanimous
vote
to
be
chief
magistrate
for
the
constitutional
term
of
five
years
the
senate
and
chamber
of
deputies
were
formally
constituted
in
due
course
and
the
government
of
the
republic
resumed
normal
conditions
of
existence
the
new
president
showed
admirable
tact
in
dealing
with
the
difficult
problem
he
was
called
upon
to
face
party
feeling
still
ran
high
between
the
partisans
of
the
two
sides
of
the
recent
conflict
admiral
montt
took
the
view
that
it
was
politic
and
just
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
he
acted
conscientiously
by
this
principle
in
all
administrative
measures
in
connexion
with
the
supporters
of
the
late
president
balmaceda
early
in
an
amnesty
was
granted
to
the
officers
of
the
balmaceda
régime
and
they
were
freely
permitted
to
return
to
chile
without
any
attempt
being
made
to
molest
them
the
first
political
act
of
national
importance
of
the
new
government
was
the
grant
of
control
to
the
municipalities
which
hitherto
had
possessed
little
power
to
direct
local
affairs
and
were
not
even
permitted
to
dispose
of
the
municipal
revenues
to
any
important
amount
without
first
obtaining
the
consent
of
the
central
government
almost
absolute
power
was
now
given
these
corporations
to
manage
their
own
concerns
and
the
organization
of
the
police
was
placed
in
their
hands
at
a
later
period
however
it
was
found
necessary
to
modify
this
latter
condition
president
montt
next
turned
his
attention
towards
the
question
of
how
best
to
repair
the
damage
occasioned
to
the
country
by
eight
months
of
civil
warfare
the
plan
of
public
works
authorized
in
was
reconsidered
and
the
construction
of
portions
of
the
various
undertakings
recommenced
the
army
and
navy
were
reorganized
additional
instructors
were
brought
from
germany
and
all
arms
of
the
military
service
were
placed
on
a
thoroughly
efficient
footing
in
matters
of
drill
and
discipline
several
new
and
powerful
cruisers
were
added
to
the
navy
and
the
internal
economy
of
this
branch
of
the
national
defence
was
thoroughly
inspected
and
many
defects
were
remedied
president
montt
then
took
in
hand
the
question
of
a
reform
of
the
currency
the
abolition
of
inconvertible
paper
money
and
the
of
a
gold
basis
as
the
monetary
standard
of
the
republic
this
reform
of
the
currency
became
the
keynote
of
the
president
policy
during
the
remainder
of
his
term
of
office
great
opposition
was
raised
by
the
representatives
of
the
debtor
class
in
congress
to
the
suppression
of
the
inconvertible
paper
money
but
in
the
end
president
montt
carried
the
day
and
on
the
of
february
a
measure
finally
became
law
establishing
a
gold
currency
as
the
only
legal
tender
in
chile
in
july
the
conversion
act
was
put
in
force
a
dollar
of
being
the
monetary
unit
adopted
in
relations
with
the
neighbouring
republic
of
argentina
began
to
become
somewhat
strained
in
regard
to
the
interpretation
of
the
treaty
concerning
the
boundary
between
the
two
countries
the
treaties
of
and
left
doubts
in
the
minds
of
both
chileans
and
argentines
as
to
the
position
of
the
frontier
line
on
the
of
april
another
protocol
was
drawn
up
by
which
the
contending
parties
agreed
to
submit
any
differences
to
the
arbitration
of
great
britain
at
the
instance
of
one
or
both
governments
president
montt
had
now
fulfilled
his
term
of
office
and
on
the
of
september
he
handed
over
the
presidential
power
to
his
successor
señor
federico
errázuriz
who
had
been
duly
elected
in
the
month
of
june
previously
president
errázuriz
crisis
with
argentina
the
election
for
the
position
of
president
of
the
republic
was
closely
contested
in
between
señor
errázuriz
and
señor
reyes
and
ended
in
the
triumph
of
the
former
candidate
by
the
narrow
majority
of
one
vote
the
father
of
the
new
president
had
been
chief
magistrate
of
chile
from
to
and
his
administration
had
been
one
of
the
best
the
country
had
ever
enjoyed
his
son
had
therefore
traditions
to
uphold
in
the
post
he
was
now
called
upon
to
fill
at
the
beginning
of
the
public
attention
was
absorbed
by
foreign
political
questions
the
problems
to
be
solved
were
the
frontier
difficulty
with
argentina
the
question
of
the
possession
of
tacna
and
arica
with
peru
and
the
necessity
of
fulfilling
the
obligation
contracted
with
bolivia
to
give
that
country
a
seaport
on
the
pacific
coast
the
treaty
made
in
with
the
argentine
government
referring
to
the
arbitration
of
disputed
points
concerning
the
boundary
became
practically
for
the
moment
a
dead
letter
and
both
argentines
and
chileans
began
to
talk
openly
of
an
appeal
to
arms
to
settle
the
matter
once
for
all
the
governments
of
both
countries
began
to
purchase
large
supplies
of
war
material
and
generally
to
make
preparations
for
a
possible
conflict
in
these
circumstances
no
final
settlement
with
peru
and
bolivia
was
possible
the
authorities
of
those
republics
holding
back
to
see
the
issue
of
the
dispute
and
chile
being
in
no
position
at
the
time
to
insist
on
any
terms
being
arranged
so
matters
drifted
until
the
beginning
of
in
july
of
that
year
the
crisis
reached
an
acute
stage
both
chile
and
argentina
put
forward
certain
pretensions
to
territory
in
the
atacama
district
to
the
north
and
also
to
a
section
of
patagonia
in
the
south
neither
side
would
give
way
nor
was
any
disposition
exhibited
to
refer
the
matter
to
arbitration
under
the
protocol
of
the
cry
of
an
acute
financial
crisis
emanating
from
the
fear
of
war
with
argentina
was
now
raised
in
chile
the
president
was
advised
that
the
only
way
of
averting
the
financial
ruin
of
the
banking
institutions
of
the
republic
was
to
suspend
the
conversion
law
and
lend
from
the
national
treasury
inconvertible
notes
to
the
banks
señor
errázuriz
weakly
gave
way
and
a
decree
was
promulgated
placing
the
currency
once
more
on
an
inconvertible
paper
money
basis
until
in
august
of
the
chilean
government
determined
to
insist
upon
the
terms
of
the
protocol
of
being
acted
upon
and
intimated
to
argentina
that
they
demanded
the
fulfilment
of
the
clause
relating
to
arbitration
on
disputed
points
this
was
practically
an
ultimatum
and
a
refusal
on
the
part
of
the
argentine
government
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
agreement
meant
a
declaration
of
war
by
chile
for
a
few
days
the
issue
hung
in
the
balance
and
then
the
argentine
government
accepted
the
provisions
made
in
for
arbitration
the
dispute
concerning
the
atacama
district
was
submitted
to
an
arbitration
tribunal
consisting
of
the
representative
of
the
united
states
in
argentina
assisted
by
one
argentine
and
one
chilean
commissioner
this
tribunal
after
due
investigation
gave
their
decision
in
april
and
the
verdict
was
accepted
unreservedly
by
both
governments
the
dispute
regarding
the
patagonian
territory
was
submitted
to
the
arbitration
of
great
britain
and
a
commission
consisting
of
lord
macnaghten
sir
john
ardagh
and
sir
holdich
was
appointed
in
to
hear
the
case
the
argentine
difficulty
was
ended
but
chile
still
had
to
find
a
settlement
with
peru
and
bolivia
the
treaty
made
with
the
former
country
in
was
not
ratified
as
it
was
thought
to
concede
too
much
to
peru
and
the
subsequent
treaty
was
rejected
on
account
of
peru
claiming
that
only
peruvians
and
not
all
residents
should
have
the
right
to
vote
in
the
plebiscite
to
be
taken
by
the
terms
of
the
treaty
of
for
the
possession
of
tacna
and
arica
by
the
terms
of
the
armistice
of
between
chile
and
bolivia
a
three
notice
had
to
be
given
by
either
government
wishing
to
denounce
that
agreement
by
the
protocol
of
chile
agreed
to
give
to
bolivia
the
port
of
arica
or
some
other
suitable
position
on
the
seaboard
on
these
lines
a
settlement
was
proposed
vitor
a
a
little
to
the
south
of
arica
was
offered
by
the
chilean
government
to
bolivia
but
refused
as
not
complying
with
the
conditions
stated
in
the
protocol
of
the
bolivians
furthermore
preferred
to
wait
and
see
if
arica
was
finally
ceded
by
peru
to
chile
and
if
so
to
claim
the
fulfilment
of
the
terms
of
the
protocol
after
the
accession
to
office
of
president
errázuriz
there
was
no
stability
of
any
ministry
political
parties
in
congress
were
so
evenly
balanced
and
so
subdivided
into
groups
that
a
vote
against
the
ministry
was
easy
to
obtain
and
the
resignation
of
the
cabinet
immediately
followed
in
accordance
with
the
parliamentary
system
in
vogue
in
chile
the
president
of
the
republic
has
no
power
to
dissolve
the
chambers
to
endeavour
to
remedy
the
evil
by
one
or
another
political
party
obtaining
a
substantial
working
majority
but
must
wait
to
see
the
results
of
the
triennial
elections
as
a
consequence
of
these
conditions
conservative
liberal
and
coalition
ministries
held
office
at
short
intervals
these
unsettled
political
circumstances
checked
any
continuity
of
policy
and
tended
to
block
the
passage
of
all
useful
legislation
to
help
forward
the
economic
development
of
the
country
and
inhabitants
on
the
other
hand
the
financial
situation
was
better
by
the
end
of
than
in
the
previous
year
since
all
proposals
for
a
fresh
paper
issue
had
been
vetoed
and
the
elections
for
congress
and
municipal
office
at
the
opening
of
returned
a
majority
favourable
to
a
stable
currency
policy
in
september
a
fresh
outburst
of
hostile
feeling
against
chile
was
created
in
argentina
by
a
note
addressed
by
the
chilean
government
to
bolivia
intimating
that
chile
was
no
longer
inclined
to
hand
over
the
port
of
arica
or
any
other
port
on
the
pacific
but
considered
the
time
ripe
for
a
final
settlement
of
the
questions
connected
with
the
chilean
occupation
of
bolivian
territory
which
had
now
been
outstanding
for
sixteen
years
the
foreign
policy
of
chile
as
indicated
by
this
note
was
considered
by
argentina
to
be
grasping
and
unconciliatory
and
there
were
rumours
of
an
south
american
federation
chile
disclaimed
any
aggressive
intentions
but
in
december
the
bolivian
congress
declined
to
relinquish
their
claim
to
a
port
and
refused
to
conclude
a
definite
treaty
of
peace
the
year
closed
with
a
frontier
incident
between
chile
and
argentina
in
the
disputed
territory
of
ultima
esperanza
where
some
argentine
colonists
were
ejected
by
chilean
police
but
both
governments
signed
protocols
agreeing
not
to
take
aggressive
action
in
consequence
president
riesco
at
the
opening
of
the
country
was
chiefly
interested
in
the
forthcoming
presidential
election
for
which
the
candidates
were
don
pedro
montt
conservative
and
clerical
and
señor
german
riesco
liberal
the
relations
between
president
errázuriz
and
congress
became
rather
strained
owing
to
the
former
inclination
to
retain
in
office
a
ministry
on
which
congress
had
passed
a
vote
of
censure
but
errázuriz
had
been
in
for
more
than
a
year
and
on
the
of
may
he
resigned
and
died
in
july
at
the
ensuing
election
riesco
was
elected
president
the
attitude
of
chile
towards
the
congress
at
mexico
became
a
matter
of
interest
in
the
autumn
particularly
in
connexion
with
the
proposal
for
compulsory
arbitration
between
all
american
governments
the
chilean
government
made
it
quite
clear
that
they
would
withdraw
from
the
congress
if
this
proposal
was
meant
to
be
retroactive
and
their
unyielding
attitude
testified
to
the
apprehensions
felt
by
chile
concerning
united
states
interference
in
october
the
chilean
government
announced
that
the
contemplated
conversion
scheme
for
which
gold
had
been
accumulated
would
be
postponed
for
two
years
till
october
the
gold
being
held
as
a
reserve
fund
pending
the
result
of
the
arbitration
over
the
argentine
frontier
this
was
generally
considered
to
be
a
reasonable
and
statesmanlike
course
unfortunately
a
recrudescence
of
the
excitement
over
the
boundary
dispute
was
occasioned
by
the
irritation
created
in
argentina
by
the
fact
that
pending
a
decision
chile
was
constructing
roads
in
the
disputed
territory
during
december
relations
were
exceedingly
strained
and
troops
were
called
out
on
both
sides
but
at
the
end
of
the
month
it
was
agreed
to
leave
the
question
to
the
british
arbitrators
and
the
latter
decided
to
send
one
of
their
number
sir
holdich
to
examine
the
territory
argentine
boundary
award
the
survey
occupied
some
eight
months
and
it
was
not
until
the
autumn
that
sir
holdich
returned
to
england
to
make
his
report
the
difficulty
of
ascertaining
the
true
line
watershed
had
been
very
great
but
the
result
was
eminently
successful
the
award
of
king
edward
was
signed
on
the
of
november
and
both
parties
to
the
litigation
were
satisfied
in
order
that
future
disputes
might
be
amicably
settled
a
treaty
was
signed
by
which
it
was
agreed
that
any
question
that
might
arise
should
be
submitted
to
the
arbitration
of
great
britain
or
in
default
of
that
power
to
the
swiss
confederation
the
removal
of
this
source
of
irritation
and
the
restoration
of
friendly
relations
between
the
two
republics
was
a
great
relief
to
the
finance
of
chile
had
it
not
been
for
the
political
instability
of
the
country
the
effects
of
the
diminution
of
expenditure
on
military
and
naval
preparations
would
have
effected
a
rapid
improvement
in
its
financial
position
the
constant
change
of
ministry
there
being
no
stable
majority
in
the
congress
prevented
during
any
settled
policy
or
that
confidence
in
the
government
which
is
the
basis
of
commercial
prosperity
in
however
both
trade
and
revenue
showed
signs
of
improvement
and
the
sale
of
the
warships
esmeralda
and
chambuco
for
furnished
a
surplus
which
was
devoted
to
the
improvement
of
the
port
of
valparaiso
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
period
of
steady
industrial
growth
and
development
the
settlement
of
the
long
outstanding
dispute
with
bolivia
in
a
treaty
of
peace
signed
on
the
of
october
was
very
advantageous
to
both
countries
by
this
treaty
bolivia
ceded
all
claims
to
a
seaport
and
strip
of
the
coast
on
condition
that
chile
constructed
at
her
own
charges
a
railway
to
lapaz
from
the
port
of
arica
giving
at
the
same
time
to
bolivia
free
transit
across
chilean
territory
to
the
sea
a
cash
indemnity
of
was
also
paid
and
certain
stipulations
were
made
with
regard
to
the
construction
of
other
railways
giving
access
from
chile
to
the
bolivian
interior
valparaiso
earthquake
the
prosperity
of
chile
was
to
suffer
a
rude
shock
on
the
of
august
a
terrible
earthquake
visited
valparaiso
and
the
surrounding
district
the
town
of
valparaiso
was
almost
entirely
destroyed
while
santiago
and
other
towns
were
severely
shaken
and
suffered
much
damage
it
was
estimated
that
about
persons
were
killed
a
still
larger
number
injured
and
at
least
rendered
homeless
the
loss
of
property
was
enormous
the
fire
which
broke
out
after
the
earthquake
shock
had
subsided
added
to
the
horror
of
the
catastrophe
measures
were
however
promptly
taken
for
succouring
the
people
who
had
been
driven
from
their
homes
and
the
task
of
restoration
was
vigorously
taken
in
hand
before
the
end
of
the
year
the
rebuilding
of
the
city
was
rapidly
progressing
president

in
señor
pedro
montt
was
elected
president
and
entered
upon
his
office
on
the
of

the
personality
of
the
president
however
had
become
of
much
less
importance
in
modern
chile
than
in
earlier
days
up
to
the
government
was
in
the
hands
of
a
small
oligarchy
of
santiago
families
but
the
president
enjoyed
large
powers
of
initiative
nowadays
the
congress
has
virtually
absorbed
the
executive
power
with
the
result
that
the
cabinet
is
often
changed
many
times
in
one
year
this
prevents
indeed
any
continuity
of
policy
for
the
majority
in

is
perpetually
fluctuating
and
ministerial
crises
rapidly
follow
one
another
chile
however
except
in
the
balmacedist
civil
war
is
happily
distinguished
by
its
freedom
from
revolution
and
serious
political
unrest
its
history
in
this
respect
is
in
marked
contrast
to
that
of
the
neighbouring
south
american
states
the
completion
of
the
railway
between
valparaiso
and
buenos

was
bound
to
be
of
immense

this
quarter
with
a
naval
descent
upon
pisagua
followed
by
an
advance
inland
to
dolores
the
congressional
forces
failed
at
first
to
make
good
their
footing
of
january
but
though
defeated
in
two
or
three
actions
they
brought
off
many
recruits
and
a
quantity
of
munitions
of
war
on
the
they
retook
pisagua
and
on
the
of
february
the
balmacedist
commander
eulojio
robles
who
offered
battle
in
the
expectation
of
receiving
reinforcements
from
tacna
was
completely
defeated
on
the
old
battlefield
of

robles
fell

along

called
up
troops
from

iquique
in

meanwhile
fell
to
the
congressional
fleet
on
the
the
pisagua
line
of
operations
was
at
once
abandoned
and
the
military
forces
of
the
congress
were
moved
by
sea
to
iquique
whence
under
the
command
of
colonel
estanislao
del
canto
they
started
inland
the
battle
of
pozo
almonte
fought
on
the
of
march
was
desperately
contested
but
del
canto
was
superior
in
numbers
and
robles
was
himself
killed
and
his
army
dispersed
after
this
the
other
balmacedist
troops
in
the
north
gave
up
the
struggle
some
were
driven
into
peru
others
into
bolivia
and
one
column
made
a
laborious
retreat
from
calama
to
santiago
in
the
course
of
which
it
twice
crossed
the
main
chain
of
the
andes
the
congressional
de
now
established
in
iquique
prosecuted
the
war
vigorously
and
by
the
end
of

the
whole
country
was
in
the
hands
of
the
rebels
from
the
peruvian
border
to
the
outposts
of
the
balmacedists
at
coquimbo
and
la
serena
the
now
began
the
formation
of
a
properly
organized
army
for
the
next
campaign
which
it
was
believed
universally
on
both
sides
would
be
directed
against
coquimbo
but
in
a
few
months
the
arrival
of
the
new
ships
from
europe
would
reopen
the
struggle
for
command
of
the
sea
the
condell
and
lynch
had
already
weakened
the
congressional
squadron
severely
by
sinking
the
blanco
encalada
in
caldera
bay
of
april
and
the
congressional
party
could
no
longer
aim
at
a
methodical
conquest
of
successive
provinces
but
was
compelled
to
attempt
to
crush
the
dictator
at
a
blow
where
this
blow
was
to
fall
was
not
decided
up
to
the
last
moment
but
the
instrument
which
was
to
deliver
it
was
prepared
with
all
the
care
possible
under
the
circumstances
del
canto
was
made
and
an
officer
emil
körner
chief
of
staff
the
army
was
organized
in
three
brigades
of
all
arms
at
iquique
caldera
and
vallenar
körner
superintended
the
training
of
the
men
gave
instruction
in
tactics
to
the
officers
caused
maps
to
be
prepared
and
in
general
took
every
precaution
that
his
experience
could
suggest
to
ensure
success
del
canto
was
himself
no
mere
figurehead
but
a
thoroughly
capable
leader
who
had
distinguished
himself
at
tacna
and
miraflores
as
well
as
in
the
present
war
the
men
were
enthusiastic
and
the
officers
unusually
numerous
the
artillery
was
fair
the
cavalry
good
and
the
train
and
auxiliary
services
well
organized
about
of
the
infantry
were
armed
with
the
männlicher
magazine
rifle
which
now
made
its
first
appearance
in
war
the
remainder
had
the
gras
and
other
which
were
also
the
armament
of
the
dictator
infantry
balmaceda
could
only
wait
upon
events
but
he
prepared
his
forces
as
best
he
was
able
and
his
constantly
harried
the
congressional
navy
by
the
end
of
july
del
canto
and
körner
had
done
their
work
as
well
as
time
permitted
and
early
in
august
the
troops
prepared
to
embark
not
for
coquimbo
but
for
valparaiso
itself
the
expedition
by
sea
was
admirably
managed
and
quinteros
of
valparaiso
and
not
many
miles
out
of
range
of
its
batteries
was
occupied
on
the
of
august
balmaceda
was
surprised
but
acted
promptly
the
first
battle
was
fought
on
the
aconcagua
at
concon
on
the
the
eager
infantry
of
the
congressional
army
forced
the
passage
of
the
river
and
stormed
the
heights
held
by
the
gobernistas
capturing
guns
the
killed
and
wounded
of
the
balmacedists
numbered
and
nearly
all
the
prisoners
about
men
enrolled
themselves
in
the
rebel
army
which
thus
more
than
made
good
its
loss
of
killed
and
wounded
the
victors
pressed
on
towards
valparaiso
but
were
soon
brought
up
by
the
strong
fortified
position
of
the
balmacedist
general
barbosa
at
viña
del
mar
whither
balmaceda
hurried
up
all
available
troops
from
valparaiso
and
santiago
and
even
from
concepción
del
canto
and
körner
now
resolved
on
a
daring
step
supplies
of
all
kinds
were
brought
up
from
quinteros
to
the
front
and
on
the
of
august
the
army
abandoned
its
line
of
communications
and
marched
inland
the
flank
march
was
conducted
with
great
skill
little
opposition
was
encountered
and
the
rebels
finally
appeared
to
the
of
valparaiso
here
on
the
took
place
the
decisive
battle
of
la
placilla
concon
had
been
perhaps
little
more
than
the
destruction
of
an
isolated
corps
the
second
battle
was
a
fair
trial
of
strength
for
barbosa
was
well
prepared
and
had
under
his
command
the
greater
part
of
the
existing
forces
of
the
dictator
but
the
splendid
fighting
qualities
of
the
congressional
troops
and
the
superior
generalship
of
their
leaders
prevailed
in
the
end
over
every
obstacle
the
government
army
was
practically
annihilated
men
were
killed
including
barbosa
and
his
second
in
command
and
wounded
the
congressional
army
lost
over
men
valparaiso
was
occupied
the
same
evening
and
santiago
soon
afterwards
there
was
no
further
fighting
for
so
great
was
the
effect
of
the
battles
of
concon
and
la
placella
that
even
the

the
proximate
cause
of
this
war
was
the
seizure
by
the
authorities
of
bolivia
of
the
effects
of
the
chilean
nitrate
company
at
antofagasta
then
part
of
the
bolivian
province
of
atacama
the
first
act
of
hostility
was
the
despatch
of
soldiers
to
protect
chilean
interests
at
antofagasta
this
force
under
colonel
sotomayor
landed
and
marched
inland
the
only
resistance
encountered
was
at
calama
on
the
river
loa
where
a
handful
of
newly
raised
militia
was
routed
march
about
the
same
time
chilean
warships
occupied
cobija
and
tocapilla
and
sotomayor
after
his
victory
at
calama
marched
to
the
latter
port
bolivia
had
declared
war
on
the
of
march
but
peru
not
till
the
of
april
this
delay
gave
the
chileans
time
to
occupy
every
port
on
the
bolivian
coast
thus
the
chilean
admiral
was
able
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
blockade
of
the
southern
ports
of
peru
and
in
particular
iquique
where
there
took
place
the
first
naval
action
of
the
war
on
the
of
april
the
chilean
sloop
esmeralda
and
the
gunboat
covadonga
both
small
and
weak
ships
engaged
the
peruvian
heavy
ironclads
huascar
and
independencia
after
a
hot
fight
the
huascar
under
miguel
grau
sank
the
esmeralda
under
arturo
piat
who
was
killed
but
carlos
condell
in
the
covadonga
manoeuvred
the
independencia
aground
and
shelled
her
into
a
complete
wreck
the
chileans
now
gave
up
the
blockade
and
concentrated
all
their
efforts
on
the
destruction
of
the
huascar
while
the
allies
organized
a
field
army
in
the
neighbourhood
of
tacna
and
a
large
chilean
force
assembled
at
antofagasta
on
the
of
october
the
huascar
was
brought
to
action
off
angamos
by
the
blanco
encalada
and
the
almirante
cochrane
grau
was
outmatched
as
hopelessly
and
made
as
brave
a
fight
as
prat
at
iquique
early
in
the
action
a
shot
destroyed
the
peruvian
conning
tower
killing
grau
and
his
staff
and
another
entered
her
turret
killing
the
flag
captain
and
nearly
all
the
crew
of
the
turret
guns
when
the
huascar
finally
surrendered
she
had
but
one
gun
left
in
action
her
fourth
commander
and
of
her
crew
were
killed
and
wounded
and
the

been
shot
away
the
peruvian
navy
had
now
ceased
to
exist
the
chileans
resumed
the
blockade
and
more
active
operations
were
soon
undertaken
the
whole
force
of
the
allies
was
about
men
scattered
along
the
seaboard
of
peru
the
chileans
on
the
other
hand
had
a
striking
force
of
men
in
the
neighbourhood
of
antofagasta
and
of
this
nearly
half
was
embarked
for
pisagua
on
the
of
october
the
expeditionary
force
landed
in
the
face
of
considerable
opposition
on
the
of
november
and
captured
pisagua
from
pisagua
the
peruvians
and
bolivians
fell
back
along
the
railway
to
their
reinforcements
and
when
some
men
had
been
collected
they
moved
forward
to
attack
the
chilean
position
of
san
francisco
near
dolores
station
november
in
the
end
the
chileans
were
victorious
but
their
only
material
gain
was
the
possession
of
iquique
and
the
retreat
of
the
allies
who
fell
back
inland
towards
tarapacá
the
tardy
pursuit
of
the
chileans
ended
in
the
battle
of
tarapacá
on
the
in
this
the
allies
were
at
first
surprised
but
rapidly
recovering
themselves
took
the
offensive
and
after
a
murderous
fight
in
which
more
men
were
killed
than
were
wounded
the
chileans
suffered
a
complete
defeat
for
some
inexplicable
reason
the
allies
made
no
use
of
their
victory
continued
to
retreat
and
left
the
chileans
in
complete
possession
of
the
tarapacá
region
with
this

taken
possession
of

bolivian
seaboard

peruvian
province
of
tarapacá
and
had
destroyed
the
hostile

the
objective
of
the
chileans
in

second
campaign
was
the
province
of
tacna

was
again
carried
out

careful
preparations
were
made

march
and
on

the
advanced
corps
started
inland
for
moquegua

was
occupied

the
peruvians
some
strong
took
up
an
unusually
strong
position
in
the
defile
of
cuesta
de
los
angeles
but
the
great
numerical
superiority
of
the
assailants
enabled
them
to
turn
the
flanks
and
press
the
front
of
the
peruvian
position
and
after
a
severe
struggle
the
defence
collapsed
march
in
april
the
army
began
its
advance
southward
from
moquegua
to
tacna
while
the
chilean
warships
engaged
in
a
series
of
minor
naval
operations
in
and
about

had
ere
this
culminated
in
the
battle
of
tacna
may
in
which
the
chileans
attacked
at
first
in
several
disconnected
bodies
and
suffered
severely
until
all
their
forces
came
on

side
the

the
of
june
a
general
assault
was
made
and
before
nightfall
the
whole
of
the
defences
were
in
the
hands
of
the
chileans
their
second
campaign
had
given
them
entire
possession
of
another
strip
of
peru
from
pisagua
to
ylo
and
they
had
shown
themselves
greatly
superior
both
in
courage
and
leadership
to
their
opponents
while
the
army
prepared
for
the
next
campaign
the
chilean
navy
was
active
the
blockade
became
more
stringent

several
fights
took
place

and
inland
the
chilean
army
was
reorganized
during
the
summer
and
prepared
for
its
next
operation
this
time
against
lima
itself
general
baquedano
was
in
command
the
leading
troops
disembarked
at
pisco
on
the
of
november
and
the
whole
army
was
ready
to
move
against
the
defences
of
lima
six
weeks
later
these
defences
consisted
of
two
distinct
positions
chorrillos
and
miraflores
the
latter
being
about
yds
outside
lima
the
first
line
of
defence
was
attacked
by
baquedano
on
the
of
january
reconnaissances
proved
that
the
peruvian
lines
could
not
be
turned
and
the
battle
was
a
pure
frontal
attack
the
defenders
had
men
in
the
lines
the
chileans
engaged
about
the
battle
of
chorrillos
ended
in
the
complete
defeat
of
the
peruvians
less
than
a
quarter
of
whose
army
rallied
behind
the
miraflores
defences
the
chileans
lost
over
men
two
days
later
took
place
the
battle
of
miraflores
january
here
the
defences
were
very
strong
and
the
action
began
with
a
daring
by
some
peruvians
neither
party
had
intended
to
fight
a
battle
for
negotiations
were
in
progress
but
the
action
quickly
became
general
its
result
was
as
before
the
complete
dissolution
of
the
defending
army
lima
incapable
of
defence
was
occupied
by
the
invaders
on
the
and
on
the
callao
surrendered
the
resistance
of
the
peruvians
was
so
far
broken
that
chile
left
only
a
small
army
of
occupation
to
deal
with
the
remnants
of
their
army
the
last
engagement
took

chillingworth
william
english
divine
and
controversialist
was
born
at
oxford
in
october
in
june
he
became
a
scholar
of
trinity
college
oxford
and
was
made
a
fellow
of
his
college
in
june
he
had
some
reputation
as
a
skilful
disputant
excelled
in
mathematics
and
gained
some
credit
as
a
writer
of
verses
the
marriage
of
charles
with
henrietta
maria
of
france
had
stimulated
the
propaganda
of
the
roman
catholic
church
and
the
jesuits
made
the
universities
their
special
point
of
attack
one
of
them
john
fisher
who
had
his
sphere
at
oxford
succeeded
in
making
a
convert
of
young
chillingworth
and
prevailed
upon
him
to
go
to
the
jesuit
college
at
douai
influenced
however
by
his
godfather
laud
then
bishop
of
london
he
resolved
to
make
an
impartial
inquiry
into
the
claims
of
the
two
churches
after
a
short
stay
he
left
douai
in
and
returned
to
oxford
on
grounds
of
scripture
and
reason
he
at
length
declared
for
protestantism
and
wrote
in
but
did
not
publish
a
confutation
of
the
motives
which
had
led
him
over
to
rome
this
paper
was
lost
the
other
on
the
same
subject
was
probably
written
on
some
other
occasion
at
the
request
of
his
friends
he
would
not
however
take
orders
his
theological
sensitiveness
appears
in
his
refusal
of
a
preferment
offered
to
him
in
by
sir
thomas
coventry
lord
keeper
of
the
great
seal
he
was
in
difficulty
about
subscribing
the
articles
as
he
informed
gilbert
sheldon
then
warden
of
all
souls
in
a
letter
he
was
fully
resolved
on
two
points
that
to
say
that
the
fourth
commandment
is
a
law
of
god
appertaining
to
christians
is
false
and
unlawful
and
that
the
damnatory
clauses
in
the
athanasian
creed
are
most
false
and
in
a
high
degree
presumptuous
and
schismatical
to
subscribe
therefore
he
felt
would
be
to
subscribe
his
own
damnation
at
this
time
his
principal
work
was
far
towards
completion
it
was
undertaken
in
defence
of
dr
christopher
potter
provost
of
queen
college
in
oxford
who
had
for
some
time
been
carrying
on
a
controversy
with
a
jesuit
known
as
edward
knott
but
whose
real
name
was
matthias
wilson
potter
had
replied
in
to
knott
and
knott
retaliated
with
and
this
work
chillingworth
engaged
to
answer
and
knott
hearing
of
his
intention
and
hoping
to
bias
the
public
mind
hastily
brought
out
a
pamphlet
tending
to
show
that
chillingworth
was
a
socinian
who
aimed
at
perverting
not
only
catholicism
but
christianity
laud
now
archbishop
of
canterbury
was
not
a
little
solicitous
about
chillingworth
reply
to
knott
and
at
his
request
as
the
young
man
had
given
cause
why
a
more
watchful
eye
should
be
held
over
him
and
his
writings
it
was
examined
by
the
of
oxford
and
two
professors
of
divinity
and
published
with
their
approbation
in
with
the
title
religion
of
protestants
a
safe
way
to
the
main
argument
is
a
vindication
of
the
sole
authority
of
the
bible
in
spiritual
matters
and
of
the
free
right
of
the
individual
conscience
to
interpret
it
in
the
preface
chillingworth
expresses
his
new
view
about
subscription
to
the
articles
for
the
church
of
england
he
there
says
i
am
persuaded
that
the
constant
doctrine
of
it
is
so
pure
and
orthodox
that
whosoever
believes
it
and
lives
according
to
it
undoubtedly
he
shall
be
saved
and
that
there
is
no
error
in
it
which
may
necessitate
or
warrant
any
man
to
disturb
the
peace
or
renounce
the
communion
of
it
this
in
my
opinion
is
all
intended
by
subscription
his
scruples
having
thus
been
overcome
he
was
in
the
following
year
promoted
to
the
chancellorship
of
the
church
of
sarum
with
the
prebend
of
brixworth
in
northamptonshire
annexed
to
it
in
the
great
civil
struggle
he
used
his
pen
against
the
scots
and
was
in
the
army
at
the
siege
of
gloucester
inventing
certain
engines
for
assaulting
the
town
shortly
afterwards
he
accompanied
lord
hopton
general
of
the
king
troops
in
the
west
in
his
march
and
being
laid
up
with
illness
at
arundel
castle
he
was
there
taken
prisoner
by
the
parliamentary
forces
under
sir
william
waller
as
he
was
unable
to
go
to
london
with
the
garrison
he
was
conveyed
to
chichester
and
died
there
in
january
his
last
days
were
harassed
by
the
diatribes
of
the
puritan
preacher
francis
cheynell
besides
his
principal
work
chillingworth
wrote
a
number
of
smaller
papers
published
in
the
posthumous
and
nine
of
his
sermons
have
been
preserved
in
politics
he
was
a
zealous
royalist
asserting
that
even
the
unjust
and
tyrannous
violence
of
princes
may
not
be
resisted
although
it
might
be
avoided
in
terms
of
the
instruction
when
they
persecute
you
in
one
city
flee
into
another
his
writings
long
enjoyed
a
high
popularity
the
of
is
characterized
by
much
fairness
and
acuteness
of
argument
and
was
commended
by
locke
as
a
discipline
of
perspicuity
and
the
way
of
right
reasoning
the
charge
of
socinianism
was
frequently
brought
against
him
but
as
tillotson
thought
for
no
other
cause
but
his
worthy
and
successful
attempts
to
make
the
christian
religion
reasonable
his
creed
and
the
whole
gist
of
his
argument
is
expressed
in
a
single
sentence
i
am
fully
assured
that
god
does
not
and
therefore
that
men
ought
not
to
require
any
more
of
any
man
than
this
to
believe
the
scripture
to
be
god
word
and
to
endeavour
to
find
the
true
sense
of
it

may
be
regarded
as
the
type
of
merovingian
sovereigns
he
was
exceedingly
anxious
to
extend
the

authority
he
levied
numerous
imposts

his

sold

rationalistic
conception
of

pretended
to
some
literary
culture
and
was
the
author
of
some
halting
verse

even
added
letters
to

have
the

wresting

hundreds
an
old
principle
of
english
parliamentary
law
declared
that
a
member
of

once
duly
chosen
could
not
his
seat
this
rule
was
a
relic
of
the
days
when
the
local
gentry
had
to
be
compelled
to
serve
in
parliament
the
only
method
therefore
of
avoiding
the
rule
came
to
be
by
accepting
an
office
of
profit
from
the
crown
a
statute
of
enacting
that
every
member
accepting
an
office
of
profit
from
the

should
thereby
vacate
his
seat

should
be
capable

in

had
been
created

half
of

to
be
found
the
names
of
several
crown
stewardships
which
apparently
were
not
regarded
as
places
of
profit
under
the
crown
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
of
for
no
seats
were
vacated
by
appointment
to
them
the
first
instance
of
the
acceptance
of
such
a
stewardship
vacating
a
seat
was
in
when
the
house
decided
that
sir
wynn
on
inheriting
from
his
father
in
virtue
of
a
royal
grant
the
stewardship
of
the
lordship
and

of
bromfield

had
vacated
his
seat
on

act

idea
of
utilizing
the
appointment
to
certain
crown
stewardships
possibly
suggested
by
sir
wynn
case
as
a
pretext
for
enabling
a
member
to
resign
his
seat
was
carried
into
practice
these
nominal
stewardships
were
eight
in
number
but
only
two
survived
to
be
used
in
this
way
in
contemporary
practice
those
of
the
chilterns
and
northstead
and
when
a
member
wished
to
vacate
his
seat
he
was
accordingly
spoken
of
as
taking
the
chiltern
hundreds
and
bailiff
of

the
chiltern

formed

of

they
are
situated
on

and
the
depredations
of
the
bandits
who
found
shelter
within

became
at
an
early
period
so
alarming
that

it
is
doubtful
at
what
date
the
necessity
for
such
an
appointment
disappeared
but
the
three
hundreds
of
stoke
burnham
and
desborough
are
still
distinguished
by
the
old
name
the
appointment
of
steward
was
first
used
for
parliamentary
purposes
in
the
appointment
being
made
by
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
and
at
his
discretion
to
grant
or
not
and
the
warrant
bestowing
on
the
holder
all
wages

and
other
privileges
and
up
to
the
century
there
was
a
nominal
salary
of
attached
to
the
post
it
was
laid
down
in
by
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
that
the
chilterns
could
not
be
granted
to
more
than
one
person
in
the

day
but
this
rule
has
not
been
strictly
adhered
to
for
on
four
occasions
subsequent
to
the
chilterns
were
granted
twice
on
the

day
the
chilterns
might
be
granted
to
members
whether
they
had
taken
the
oath
or
not
or
during
a
recess
though
in
this
case
a
new
writ
could
not
be
issued
until
the
house
met
again
each
new
warrant
expressly
revoked
the

retaining
it
in
his
turn
until
another
should
be
appointed

this

was

used
for

in

was
in
more
or
less
constant
use
until
after
which
it
disappeared
this
manor
comprised
copyholds
the
usual
courts
were
held
and
the
stewardship
was
an
actual
and
active
office

duties
being
executed
by

steward
the
manor
was
sold
by
public
auction
in

in
some
manner
the
crown
retained
the
right
of
appointing
a
steward
for
seventeen
years
after
that
date
and
bailiff
of
the
manor
of

this
manor
was
crown

before

was
in

it

any

having
ever
been
derived
from
the
office
it
was
used
for
parliamentary
purposes
in
and
subsequently
of
the
manor
of
hempholme
this
manor
appears
to
have
been
of
the
same
nature
as
that

it
was

in

of

this
manor
belonged
to
the
duchy
of
cornwall
and
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
it
came
to
be
regarded
as
a
crown
appointment
it
was
first
used
for
parliamentary

in

then
occasionally

attached

the
origin
of
the

has
been
the
subject
of
much
debate
but
the
view
that
it
is
a
modification
of
the
cope
is
now
discarded
and
it
is
practically
proved
to
be
derived
from
the
medieval
tabard
or
an
upper
garment
worn
in
civil
life
by
all
classes
of
people
both
in
england
and
abroad
it
has
therefore
a
common
origin
with
certain
academic
robes
see
robes
the
word
chimere
which
first
appears
in
england
in
the
century
was
sometimes
applied
not
only
to
the
tabard
worn
over
the
rochet
but
to
the
sleeved
cassock
worn
under
it
thus
archbishop
scrope
is
described
as
wearing
when
on
his
way
to
execution
a
blue
chimere
with
sleeves
but
the
word
properly
applies
to
the
sleeveless
tabard
which
tended
to
supersede
from
the
century
onwards
the
inconvenient
a
long
closed
cloak
with
a
slit
in
front
for
the
arms
as
the
upper
garment
of
bishops
these
chimeres
the
colours
of
which
murrey
scarlet
green
may
possibly
have
denoted
academical
rank
were
part
of
the
civil
costume
of
prelates
thus
in
the
inventory
of
walter
skirlawe
bishop
of
durham
eight
chimeres
of
various
colours
are
mentioned
including
two
for
riding
the
chimere
was
moreover
a
cold
weather
garment
in
summer
its
place
was
taken
by
the
tippet
in
the
anglican
form
for
the
consecration
of
bishops
the
newly
consecrated
prelate
hitherto
vested
in
rochet
is
directed
to
put
on
the
rest
of
the
episcopal
habit
the
chimere
the
robe
has
thus
become
in
the
church
of
england
symbolical
of
the
episcopal
office
and
is
in
effect
a
liturgical
vestment
the
rubric
containing
this
direction
was
added
to
the
book
of
common
prayer
in
and
there
is
proof
that
the
development
of
the
chimere
into
at
least
a
choir
vestment
was
subsequent
to
the
reformation
foxe
indeed
mentions
that
hooper
at
his
consecration
wore
a
long
scarlet
chymere
down
to
the
foot
and
ed
a
source
of
trouble
to
himself
and
of
scandal
to
other
extreme
reformers
but
that
this
was
no
more
than
the
full
civil
dress
of
a
bishop
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
archbishop
parker
at
his
consecration
wore
surplice
and
tippet
and
only
put
on
the
chimere
when
the
service
was
over
to
go
away
in
this
civil
quality
of
the
garment
still
survives
alongside
the
other
the

an
anglican
prelate

civil

of

the
continental
equivalent
of
the

is
defined
by

ecclesiologists

a
kind
of
cassock

it

distinguished
by
having
a
small
cape

short
open
arms
reaching
to
the
middle
of
the
upper

decorated
with

not

take
the

urns
as
if
to
disguise
their
real
purpose
though
not
of
a
very
architectural
character
the
chimneys
at
venice
present
perhaps
the
greatest
variety
of
terminations
and
as
a
rule
the
smoke
comes
out
on
the
sides
and
not
through
the
top
chimneys
besides
removing
the
products
of
combustion
also
serve
to
provide
the
fire
with
the
air
requisite
for
burning
the
fuel
the
hot
air
in
the
shaft
being
lighter
than
the
cold
air
outside
it
tends
to
rise
and
as
it
does
so
air
flows
in
at
the
bottom
to
take
its
place
an
ascending
current
is
thus
established
in
the
chimney
its
velocity
other
things
being
equal
varying
as
the
square
root
of
the
height
of
the
shaft
above
the
grate
the
velocity
also
increases
with
increase
of
temperature
in
the
gas
column
but
since
the
weight
of
each
cubic
foot
grows
less
as
the
gases
expand
the
amount
of
smoke
discharged
by
a
chimney
does
not
increase
indefinitely
with
the
temperature
a
maximum
is
reached
when
the
difference
in
temperature
between
the
gases
in
the
shaft
and
the
outside
air
is
about
but
the
rate
of
increase
is
very
slow
after
the
difference
has
passed
about
in
designing
a
chimney
the
dimensions
height
and
sectional
area
have
to
be
so
proportioned
to
the
amount
of
fuel
to
be
burnt
in
the
various
furnaces
connected
with
it
that
at
the
temperature
employed
the
products
of
combustion
are
effectively
removed
due
allowance
being
made
for
the
frictional
retardation
of
the
current
against
the
sides
of
the
flues
and
shafts
and
in
passing
through
the
fire
the
velocity
of
the
current
in
actual
chimneys
varies
widely
from
or
to
or
a
second
increased
velocity
obtainable
by
increasing
the
height
of
the
shaft
gives
increased
delivering
capacity
but
a
speed
of
or
a
second
is
regarded
as
good
practice
ordinary
factory
chimneys
do
not
in
general
exceed
or
in
height
but
in
some
cases
especially
when
as
in
chemical
works
they
are
employed
to
get
rid
of
objectionable
vapours
they
have
been
made
double
that
height
or
even
more
in
section
they
are
round
octagonal
or
square
the
circular
form
offers
the
least
resistance
to
wind
pressure
and
for
a
given
height
and
sectional
area
requires
less
material
to
secure
stability
than
the
octagonal
and
still
less
than
the
square
on
the
other
hand
there
is
more
liability
to
cracking

the
material
commonly
used

the
term
given
to
the
projecting

in

times
was
built
over

the

feature
of
a
room

as
fireplaces
have
become
smaller
and
modern
methods
of
heating
have
been
introduced
its
artistic
as
well
as
its
practical
significance
has
grown
less

to
the
century

chimneypiece
known
is
that
in
the
king
house
at
southampton
with
norman
shafts
in
the
joints
carrying
a
segmental
arch
which
is
attributed
to
the
first
half
of
the
century
at
a
later
date
in
consequence
of
the
greater
width
of
the
fireplace
flat

arches
were
thrown
across
and
constructed
with
voussoirs
sometimes

thrust
of
the
arch
being
resisted
by
bars
of
iron
at
the
back
in
domestic
work
of
the
century
the
chimneypiece
was
greatly
increased
in
order
to
allow
of
the
members
of
the
family
sitting
on
either
side
of

fire
on

in
these
cases
great
beams
of

variety
of

the
english
chimneypieces
of
the
early
century
when
the
purer
italian
style
was
introduced
by
inigo
jones
were
extremely
simple
in
design
sometimes
consisting
only
of
the
ordinary
mantelpiece
with
classic
architraves
and
shelf
the
upper
part
of

breast
being
panelled
like
the
rest
of

in
the
latter
part
of
the
century
the
classic
architrave
was
abandoned
in
favour
of
a
much
bolder
and
more
effective
moulding
as
in
the
chimneypieces
at
hampton
court
and
the
shelf
was
omitted
in
the
century
the
architects
returned
to
the
inigo

classic
type

influenced
by
the
french
work
of
louis
xiv
and
xv
figure
sculpture
generally
represented
by
graceful
figures
on

side
which
assisted
to

developed
into
an
elaborate
frame
for
the

over
the

there

the
typical
has
been
long
known
to
european
science
dr
tyson
a
celebrated
surgeon
and
anatomist
of
his
time
having
dissected
a
young
individual
and
described
it
as
a
pigmy

branch
of
the
british
museum
alongside
the
volume
in
which
it
is
described
it
was
not
however
till
that
the
chimpanzee
received
what
is
now
recognized
as
a
scientific
name
having
been
christened
in
that
year
by
the
naturalist
johann
friedrich
gmelin
in
his
classification
it
was
included
in
the
same
genus
as
the
and
it
has
recently
been
suggested
that
the
name
pertains
of
right
to
the
chimpanzee
rather
than
to
the
between
the
typical
west
african
chimpanzee
and
the
gorilla
there
is
no
difficulty
in
drawing
a
distinction
the
difficulty
comes
in
when
we
have
to
deal
with
the
aberrant
races
or
species
of
chimpanzee
some
of
which
are
so
that
it
is
by
no
means
easy
to
determine
to
which
group
they
really
pertain
in
height
the
adult
male
chimpanzee
of
the
typical
form
does
not
exceed
and
the
colour
of
the
hair
is
a
full
black
while
the
skin
especially
that
of
the
face
is
the
ears
are
remarkably
large
and
prominent
and
the
hands
reach
only
a
short
distance
below
the
knees
the
head
is
rounded
and
short
without
prominent
beetling
ridges
above
the
eyes
or
a
strong
crest
along
the
middle
line
of
the
back
of
the
skull
and
the
tusks
of
the
old
males
are
of
no
very
great
length
and
prominence
moreover
there
is
no
very
marked
difference
in
the
size
of
the
two
sexes
gentleness
and
docility
are
specially
characteristic
of
the
species
even
when
while
in
the
native
state
its
habits
are
thoroughly
arboreal
in
central
africa
the
chimpanzees
assume
more
or
less
marked
traits
the
first
of
these
aberrant
types
is
schweinfurth
chimpanzee
troglodytes
which
inhabits
the
country
and
although
evidently
belonging
to
the
same
species
as
the
typical
race
exhibits
certain
features
these
traits
are
still
more
developed
in
the
bald
chimpanzee
of
loango
the
gabun
and
other
regions
of
french
congo
which
takes
its
english
name
from
the
sparse
covering
of
hair
on
the
head
the
most
of
all
the
races
is
however
the
chimpanzee
of
du
chaillu
which
inhabits
central
africa
the
celebrated
ape
mafuka
which
lived
in
the
dresden
zoological
gardens
during
and
came
from
loango
was
apparently
a
member
of
this
species
although
it
was
at
one
time
regarded
as
a
hybrid
between
a
chimpanzee
and
a
gorilla
these
traits
were
still
more
pronounced
in
johanna
a
female
chimpanzee
living
in
barnum
bailey
show
in
which
has
been
described
and
figured
by
dr
keith
the
heavy
ridges
over
the
brow
originally
supposed
to
be
distinctive
of
the
gorilla
are
particularly
well
marked
in
johanna
and
they
would
doubtless
be
still
more
noticeable
in
the
male
of
the
same
race
which
seems
to
be
undoubtedly
du
chaillu
still
the
large
size
and
prominence
of
the
ears
proclaim
that
both
mafuka
and
johanna
were
chimpanzees
and
not
gorillas
a
feature
in
johanna
is
however
the
presence
of
large
folds
at
the
sides
of
the
nostrils
which
are
absent
in
the
typical
chimpanzee
but
in
the
gorilla
extend
down
to
the
upper
lip
chimpanzees
exhibit
great
docility
in
confinement
where
however
they
seldom
survive
for
any
great
length
of
time
they
likewise
display
a
much
higher
degree
of
intelligence

any
of

hence
the

at
over
twenty
places
widely
apart

gathered
many
descriptions

states
that
its

it
had

where
it
forms
a
substantial
boundary
being
in

these
remarks
apply
with
particular
force
to
the
branch
running
from

forming
the
boundary
of

in
colonel
wingate
opinion
the
wall
was
originally
built
by
degrees
and
in
sections
not
of
hewn
stone
but
of
round
boulders
and
earth
the
different
sections
being
repaired
as
they
fell
into
ruin
only
in

was
it
composed
of

rebuilt
of

all
those
sections
through

led
a
likely
road
for
invading
tatars
to
follow
or
where
it
could
be
seen
at
a
distance
from
the
the
building
of
the
wall
was
a
sufficiently
simple
affair
not
to
be
compared
with
the
task
of

the

the

a
climate
which
resembles
that

of

severity
the
central
zone
in
which
shanghai
is
situated
has
a
generally
temperate
climate
but
over
both
northern

central
china
the
influence
of
the

mongolia
tends
to
establish
uniform
conditions
unusual
in
so
large
an

the
prevailing

the

are
caused
by
heat

thus
drawing

it
is
however
not
improbable
that
in

perhaps
be

the

however
the

no

one
of
the
most
characteristic
deposits
of
china
is
the
loess
which
not
merely
imparts
to

the
physical
character
of

also
determines

the

a
solid

friable
earth
of
colour
and
when
triturated
with

is
not
unlike
loam
but
differs
from
the
latter
by
its
highly
porous
and
tubular
structure
the
loess
soil
is
extremely
favourable
to
agriculture
see
loess
and
the
loess
is
called
by
the
chinese
or
yellow
earth
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
imperial
title
yellow
emperor
or
ruler
of
the
yellow
had
its
origin
in
the
fact
that
the
emperor
is
lord

structure
structurally
china
proper
may
be
divided
into
two
regions
separated
from
each
other
by
the
folded
range
of

which
is
a
continuation
of
the
folded
belt
of

the
palaeozoic
beds
are
in

nearly
horizontal

the
limestones

carboniferous
systems
form
an
extensive
plateau
which
rises
abruptly
from
the
western
margin
of
the
great
plain
of
northern
china
the
plateau
is
deeply
carved
by
the
rivers
which
flow
through
it
and
the
strata
are
often
faulted
but
they
are
never
sharply
folded
south
of
the
on
the
other
hand
the
palaeozoic
beds
are
thrown
into
a
series
of
folds
running
from

form
the
hilly
region
of
southern
china
towards
tongking
these
folds
probably
bend
southwards
and
join
the
folds
of
further

amongst
these
folded
beds
lie
depressions
filled
with
the
mesozoic
red
sandstone
which
lies
unconformably
upon
the
palaeozoic
rocks
the
present
configuration
of
china
is
due
in
a
very
considerable
degree
to
faulting
the
abrupt
eastern
edge
of
the
plateau
where
it
overlooks
the
great
plain
is
a
line
of
fault
or
rather
a
series
of
step
faults
with
the
downthrow
on
the
east

von
richthofen
has
shown
reason
to
believe
that
this
line
of
faulting
is
continued
far
to
the
south
and
to
the
north
he
believed
also
that
the
present
of
china
has
to
a
large
extent
been
determined
by
similar
faults
with
their
downthrow

to

of
these
two
divisions
of
the

the
northern
one
is
the
more
interesting
since
it
forms
the
chief
home
of
a

also
includes
types
represented
elsewhere
at

only
in

the
occurrence
in

of
these

is
important
in

met
with
in
foremost
among
these
is
the

probably
related
to

very
characteristic

give
an
adequate
account
of
chinese
ornithology
would
require
space
many
times
the
length
of
this
article
the
gorgeous
mandarin
duck
has
already
been
mentioned
among
generic
types
common
to
america
in
marked
distinction
to
this
is
the
number
of
species
of
pheasants
inhabiting
china
whence
the
group
ranges
into
the
eastern
himalaya
among
chinese
species
are
two
of
the
three
species
of

tragopans
or
a

three
out
of
the
five
species
of
the
other
two
being
tibetan
two
kinds
of
the
gorgeous

amherst
pheasants
alone
representing
the

together
with
several
species
of
the
typical

among
which
it
will
suffice
to
mention
the
the
himalayan

also
a
chinese
representative
the
only
other
large
bird
that
can
be
mentioned
is
the
manchurian
crane
misnamed
pigeons
include
the
peculiar
subgenus
while
among
smaller
birds
warblers
tits
and
finches
all
of
an
eastern
holarctic
type
constitute
the
common
element
in
the
avifauna
little
would
be
gained
by
naming
the
genera
peculiar
or
otherwise
china
has
a
few
peculiar
types
of
freshwater
tortoises
among
which
represents
a
genus
unknown
elsewhere
while
there
is
also
a
species
of
the
otherwise
indian
genus
the
chinese
alligator
has
been
already
mentioned
among
lizards
the
genera
and
of
which
the
two
latter
are
very
characteristic
of
the
oriental
region
range
through
china
to
japan
and
among
snakes
the
malay
python
is
likewise
chinese
the
giant
salamander
or
represents
as
mentioned
above
a
type
found
elsewhere
only
in
north
america
while
and
are
peculiar
generic
types
of
salamanders
among
fishes
it
must
suffice
to
refer
to
the
sturgeon
of
the
and
the
numerous
members
of
the
carp
family
to
be
found
in
the
rivers
of
china
from
these
native
carp
the
chinese
have
produced
two
highly
coloured
breeds
the
goldfish
and
the
carp
among
the
invertebrates
special
mention
may
be
made
of
the
great
ailanthus
of
northern
china
and
japan
and
also
of
its
manchurian
relative
while
it
may
be
added
that
the
domesticated
silkworm
is
generally
believed
to
be
of
chinese
origin
although
this
is
not
certain
very
characteristic
of
china
is
the
abundance
of
handsomely
coloured
butterflies
of
the
family
the
chinese
kermes
is
also
worth
mention
on
account
of
it
yielding
wax
as
regards
land
and
freshwater
snails
china
exhibits
a
marked
similarity
to
siam
and
india
the
two
groups
in
which
the
chinese
province
displays
decided
peculiarities
of
its
own
being
in
the
wider
sense
and
there
are
for
instance
nearly
half
a
score
of
subgenera
of
whose
headquarters
are
chinese
while
among
these
forms
with
sinistral
shells
are
relatively
common
the
genus
is
remarkable
on
account
of
attaining
a
second
centre
of
development
in
china
where
its
finest
species
referable
to
several
subgenera
occur
carnivorous
molluscs
include
a
peculiar
slug
and
the
shelled
genera
and
in
the
western
provinces
species
of
are
abundant
and
in
the
operculate
group
forms
a
peculiar
type
akin
to

with
internal
foldings
to
the
shell
lastly
it
has
to
be
mentioned
that
the
waters
of
the

inhabited
by
a
small
or
medusa
near
akin
to
which
was
discovered
in
the
tanks
in
the
botanical
gardens
in
the
regent
park
london
but
whose
real
home
is
probably
the

the
vegetation
of

is
extremely
rich

than
species

little
in
its
composition
from

the
provinces
and
the
hoklos
of
province
the
manchus
resident
in
china
are
estimated
to
number
according
to
the
imperial
customs
authorities
the
number
of
foreigners
resident
in
china
in
was
of
these
were
japanese
russian
british
german
american
portuguese
french
italian
and
belgian
emigration
the
chinese
are
a
colonizing
race
and
in
manchuria
mongolia
and
turkestan
they
have
brought
several
districts
under
cultivation
in
the
regions
where
they
settle
they
become
the
dominant
race
thus
southern
manchuria
now
differs
little
from
a
province
of
china
proper
in
the
malay
peninsula
and
throughout
the
far
east
chinese
are
numerous
as
farmers
labourers
and
traders
in
some
places
such
as
singapore
chinese
are
among
the
principal
merchants
this
colonizing
spirit
is
probably
due
more
to
the
enterprise
of
the
people
than
to
the
density
of
the
population
there
were
chinese
settlements
at
places
on
the
east
coast
of
africa
before
the
century
following
the
discovery
of
gold
in
california
there
was
from
onwards
a
large
emigration
of
chinese
to
that
state
and
to
other
parts
of
america
but
in
chinese
exclusion
acts
were
passed
by
the
united
states
an
example
followed
by
australia
where
chinese
immigration
was
also
held
to
be
a
public
danger
canada
also
adopted
the
policy
of
excluding
chinese
but
not
before
there
had
been
a
considerable
immigration
into
british
columbia
two
factors
a
racial
and
an
economic
are
at
work
to
bring
about
these
measures
of
exclusion
as
indentured
labourers
chinese
have
been
employed
in
the
west
indies
south
america
and
other
places
see
coolie
in
addition
to
several
million
chinese
settlers
in
manchuria
and
smaller
numbers
in
mongolia
turkestan
and
tibet
it
was
estimated
in
that
there
were
over
chinese
resident
beyond
the
empire
of
these
were
in
formosa
which
for
long
formed
a
part
of
the
empire
and
over
in
neighbouring
regions
of
asia
and
in
pacific
islands
in
the
west
indies
chiefly
cuba
the
number
of
chinese
was
estimated
at
in
south
america
brazil
peru
and
chile
at
in
the
united
states
at
in
canada
at
and
in
australia
and
new
zealand
at
there
are
comparatively
few
chinese
in
japan
if
formosa
be
excepted
and
korea
the
number
is
given
in
as
in
japan
and
in
korea
the
awakening
of
the
east
which
has
followed
the
war
of
has
affected
china
also
it
is
too
soon
to
say
how
far
the
influx
of
european
ideas
will
be
able
to
modify
the
immemorial
customs
and
traditions
of
perhaps
the
most
conservative
people
in
the
world
but
the
process
has
begun
and
this
fact
makes
it
difficult
to
give
a
picture
of
chinese
habits
and
customs
which
shall
be
more
than
historical
or
provisional
moreover
the
difficulty
of
presenting
a
picture
which
shall
be
true
of
china
as
a
whole
is
enhanced
by
the
different
characteristics
observable
in
various
regions
of
so
vast
a
country
the
chinese
themselves
until
the
material
superiority
of
western
civilization
forced
them
to
a
certain
degree
to
conform
to
its
standards
looked
down
from
the
height
of
their
superior
culture
with
contempt
on
the
western
barbarians
nor
was
their
attitude
wholly
without
justification
their
civilization
was
already
old
at
a
time
when
britain
and
germany
were
peopled
by
barbarians
and
the
philosophical
and
ethical
principles
on
which
it
was
based
remain
to
all
appearances
as
firmly
rooted
as
ever
that
these
principles
have
on
the
whole
helped
to
create
a
national
type
of
a
very
high
order
few
europeans
who
know
the
chinese
well
would
deny
the
chinese
are
naturally
reserved
earnest
and
for
the
occasional
outbursts
of
ferocious
violence
notably
against
foreign
settlements
are
no
index
to
the
national
character
there
is
a
national
proverb
that
the
men
of
the
four
seas
are
all
brothers
and
even
strangers
can
travel
through
the
country
without
meeting
with
rudeness
much
less
outrage
if
the
chinese
character
is
inferior
to
the
european
this
inferiority
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
chinaman
whole
philosophy
of
life
disinclines
him
to
change
or
to
energetic
action
he
is
industrious
but
his
industry
is
normally
along
the
lines
marked
out
by
authority
and
tradition
he
is
brave
but
his
courage
does
not
naturally
seek
an
outlet
in
war
the
jealously
exclusive
empire
into
which
in
the
century
the
nations
of
the
west
forced
an
entrance
was
organized
for
peace
the
arts
of
war
had
been
all
but
forgotten
and
soldiers
were
of
all
classes
the
most
despised
the
whole
social
and
political
organization
of
the
chinese
is
based
in
a
far
more
real
sense
than
in
the
west
on
the
family
the
supreme
duty
is
that
of
the
child
to
its
parent
on
this
the
whole
chinese
moral
system
is
built
up
filial
piety
according
to
the
teaching
of
confucius
is
the
very
foundation
of
society
the
nation
itself
is
but
one
great
family
and
the
authority
of
the
government
itself
is
but
an
extension
of
the
paternal
authority
to
which
all
its
children
are
bound
to
yield
implicit
obedience
the
western
idea
of
the
liberty
and
dignity
of
the
individual
as
distinct
from
the
community
to
which
he
belongs
is
wholly
alien
to
the
chinese
mind
the
political
unit
in
china
is
not
the
individual
but
the
family
and
the
father
of
the
family
is
supposed
to
be
responsible
for
the
qualities
and
views
of
all
his
kin
he
is
rewarded
for
their
virtues
punished
for
their
faults
the
deserts
of
a
son
ennoble
the
father
and
all
his
ancestors
and
conversely
his
crimes
disgrace
them
an
outcome
of
this
principle
is
the
extraordinary
importance
in
china
of
funeral
rites
especially
in
the
case
of
the
father
the
eldest
son
now
head
of
the
family
or
failing
him
his
or
adopted
son
fixes
one
of
the
three
souls
of
the
dead
in
the
tablet
commemorating
his
virtues
burns
incense
to
his
shade
and
supplies
him
with
paper
money
and
paper
representations
of
everything
clothes
servants
horses
that
he
may
require
in
his
journey
to
the
other
world
mourning
lasts
for
three
years
during
which
the
mourners
wear
white
garments
and
abstain
from
meat
wine
and
public
gatherings
custom
too
dictates
that
wherever
the
chinaman
may
die
he
must
be
brought
back
for
burial
to
the
place
of
his
birth
one
of
the
objects
of
the
friendly
societies
is
to
provide
funds
to
charter
ships
to
transport
home
the
bodies
of
those
who
have
died
abroad
annually
in
may
the
people
stream
to
the
graves
and
mortuary
temples
with
flowers
fruit
and
other
offerings
for
the
dead
christian
missionaries
have
found
in
this
ancestor
worship
the
most
serious
obstacle
to
the
spread
of
a
religion
which
teaches
that
the
convert
must
if
need
be
despise
his
father
and
his
mother
and
follow
christ
the
same
elaborate
ceremonialism
that
characterizes
the
chinese
funeral
customs
is
found
also
in
their
marriage
rites
and
the
rules
of
their
social
intercourse
generally
confucius
is
reported
to
have
said
that
all
virtues
have
their
source
in
etiquette
and
the
due
observance
of
the
ceremonial
in
the
fulfilling
of
social
duties
is
that
which
in
chinese
opinion
distinguishes
civilized
from
barbarous
peoples
the
board
of
rites
one
of
the
departments
of
the
central
government
exists
for
the
purpose
of
giving
decisions
in
matters
of
etiquette
and
ceremony
as
to
marriage
the
rule
that
the
individual
counts
for
nothing
obtains
here
in
its
fullest
significance
the
breeding
of
sons
to
carry
on
the
ancestral
cult
is
a
matter
of
prime
importance
and
the
marriage
of
a
young
man
is
arranged
at
the
earliest
possible
age
the
bride
and
bridegroom
have
little
voice
in
the
matter
the
match
being
arranged
by
the
parents
of
the
parties
the
lifting
of
the
bride
veil
so
that
the
bridegroom
may
see
her
face
is
the
very
last
act
of
the
long
and
complicated
ceremony
in
the
traditional
chinese
social
system
four
classes
are
distinguished
the
literary
the
agricultural
the
artisan
and
the
trading
class
hereditary
nobility
in
the
european
sense
scarcely
exists
and
the
possession
of
an
hereditary
title
gives
in
itself
no
special
privileges
official
position
is
more
highly
esteemed
than
birth
and
the
bureaucracy
takes
the
place
of
the
aristocracy
in
the
west
there
are
nevertheless
besides
personal
decorations
for
merit
such
as
the
yellow
jacket
five
hereditary
rewards
for
merit
these
last
only
for
a
fixed
number
of
lives
a
few
chinese
families
however
enjoy
hereditary
titles
in
the
full
sense
the
chief
among
them
being
the
holy
duke
of
yen
the
descendant
of
confucius
the
imperial
clansmen
consist
of
those
who
trace
their
descent
direct
from
the
founder
of
the
manchu
dynasty
and
are
distinguished
by
the
privilege
of
wearing
a
yellow
girdle
collateral
relatives
of
the
imperial
house
wear
a
red
girdle
twelve
degrees
of
nobility
in
a
descending
scale
as
one
generation
succeeds
another
are
conferred
on
the
descendants
of
every
emperor
in
the
thirteenth
generation
the
descendants
of
emperors
are
merged
in
the
general
population
save
that
they
retain
the
yellow
girdle
the
heads
of
eight
houses
the
or
helmeted
princes
maintain
their
titles
in
perpetuity
by
rule
of
primogeniture
in
virtue
of
having
helped
the
manchu
in
the
conquest
of
china
imperial
princes
apart
the
highest
class
is
that
forming
the
civil
service
see
also
and
the
peasant
class
forms
the
bulk
of
the
population
the
majority
of
chinese
are
small
landowners
their
standard
of
living
is
very
low
in
comparison
with
european
standards
this
is
in
part
due
to
the
system
of
land
tenure
a
parent
can
not
even
if
he
wished
to
do
so
leave
all
his
land
to
one
son
there
must
be
substantially
an
equal
division
the
will
of
the
father
notwithstanding
as
early
marriages
and
large
families
are
the
rule
this
process
of
continual
division
and
subdivision
has
brought
things
down
to
the
irreducible
minimum
in
many
places
small
patches
of
or
even
of
an
acre
are
to
be
found
as
the
estate
of
an
individual
landowner
and
the
vast
majority
of
holdings
run
between
one
and
three
acres
with
three
acres
a
family
is
deemed
very
comfortable
and
the
possession
of
ten
acres
means
luxury
the
only
class
which
at
all
resembles
the
territorial
magnates
of
other
countries
is
the
class
of
retired
officials
the
wealth
of
an
official
is
not
infrequently
invested
in
land
and
consequently
there
are
in
most
provinces
several
families
with
a
country
seat
and
the
usual
insignia
of
local
rank
and
influence
on
the
decease
of
the
heads
or
founders
of
such
families
it
is
considered
dignified
for
the
sons
to
live
together
sharing
the
rents
and
profits
in
common
this
is
sometimes
continued
for
several
generations
until
the
country
seat
becomes
an
agglomeration
of
households
and
the
family
a
sort
of
clan
a
family
of
this
kind
with
literary
traditions
and
with
the
means
to
educate
the
young
men
is
constantly
sending
its
scions
into
the
public
service
these
in
turn
bring
their
earnings
to
swell
the
common
funds
while
the
rank
and
dignity
which
they
may
earn
add
to
the
importance
and
standing
of
the
group
as
a
whole
the
members
of
this
class
are
usually
termed
the
or
gentry
the
complex
character
of
the
chinese
is
shown
in
various
ways
side
by
side
with
the
reverence
of
ancestors
the
law
recognizes
the
right
of
the
parent
to
sell
his
offspring
into
slavery
and
among
the
poor
this
is
not
an
uncommon
practice
though
in
comparison
with
the
total
population
the
number
of
slaves
is
few
the
kidnapping
of
children
for
sale
as
slaves
is
carried
on
but
there
is
no
slave
raiding
there
are
more
female
than
male
slaves
the
descendants
of
male
slaves
acquire
freedom
in
the
fifth
generation
while
every
chinese
man
is
anxious
to
have
male
children
girls
are
often
considered
superfluous
the
position
of
women
is
one
of
distinct
inferiority
a
woman
is
always
subject
to
the
men
of
her
family
before
marriage
to
her
father
during
marriage
to
her
husband
in
widowhood
to
her
son
these
states
being
known
as
the
three
obediences
sons
who
do
not
however
honour
their
mothers
outrage
public
opinion
polygamy
is
tolerated
secondary
wives
being
sometimes
provided
by
the
first
wife
when
she
is
growing
old
secondary
wives
are
subordinate
to
first
wives
a
wife
may
be
divorced
for
any
one
of
seven
reasons
the
sale
of
wives
is
practised
but
is
not
recognized
by
law
women
of
the
upper
classes
are
treated
with
much
respect
the
home
of
a
chinese
man
is
often
in
reality
ruled
by
his
mother
or
by
his
wife
as
she
approaches
old
age
a
state
held
in
veneration
chinese
women
frequently
prove
of
excellent
business
capacity
and
those
of
high
rank
as
the
recent
history
of
china
has
conspicuously
proved
exercise
considerable
influence
on
public
affairs
deforming
the
feet
of
girls
by
binding
and
stopping
their
growth
has
been
common
for
centuries
the
tottering
walk
of
the
chinese
lady
resulting
from
this
deformation
of
the
feet
is
the
admiration
of
her
husband
and
friends
is
practised
by
rich
and
poor
in
all
parts
of
the
country
but
is
not
universal
in
southern
and
western
china
hakka
women
and
certain
others
never
have
their

bound
it
has
been
noted
that

who
all

take
for

what
europeans
call
its
first

the
period
of
gestation
counting
as
one

in

social

the
chinese
are
polite
and
ceremonious
they
do
not
shake
hands

kiss
but
prostrations
kotowing
salutations
with
joined
hands
and
congratulations
are
common
they
have
no
weekly
day
of
rest
but
keep
many
festivals
the
most
important
being
that
of
new

debts
are
supposed
to
be
paid
before

for
the

other
notable
holidays
are
the
festival
of

the
feast

and
the
long

is
removed
when
in

it
is
considered
very
unwomanly
not
to
wear

and
very
indelicate
for

no

ever
bares
any

are

people

the

type
is

among

moreover
natives
of

provinces
still

striking
contrasts

to

and
their
common
culture
is
probably
the
strongest
national
link
by
some
authorities
it
is
held
that
the
parent
stock
of
the
chinese
came
from
the
beyond
the
alluvial
plain
others
hold
that
it
was
indigenous
in
eastern
china
notwithstanding
the
marked
differences
between
the
inhabitants
of
different
provinces
and
even
between
those
living
in
the

certain
features
are
common
to
the
race
the
stature
is
below
the
average
and
seldom
exceeds
except
in
the
north
the
head
is
normally
brachycephalic
or
round
horizontally

early
inclines

the

almost

yellow
however
predominates
a
few
words
may
be
added
concerning
the
manchus
who
are
the
ruling
race
in
china
their
ethnic
affinities
are
not
precisely
known
but
they
may
be
classed
among
the
tribes
although
the
term
denotes
a
linguistic
rather
than
a
racial
group
by
some
authorities
they
are
called
eastern
tatars
tatars
of

of
true
mongol
descent
manchu
is
the
name
adopted
in
the
century
by
one
of
several
tribes
which
led
a
nomadic
life
in
manchuria
and
were
known
collectively
in
the
century
as
nüchihs

authorities

the
khitans
whence
the

form
cathay
who
in
the
and
centuries
dwelt
in
the
upper
liao
region
as
the
ancestors
of
this
race
it
was
not
until
the
century
that
the
people
became
known
generally
as
manchus
and
obtained
possession
of
the
whole
of
the
country
now
bearing
their
name
see
manchuria
they
had
then
a
considerable
mixture
of
chinese
and
korean
blood
but
had
developed
a
distinct
nationality
and
kept
their
ancient
language
in
china
the
manchus
retained
their
separate
nationality
and
organization
it
was
not
until
the
early
years
of
the
century
that
steps
were
officially
taken
to
obliterate
the
distinction
between
the
two
races
the
manchus
are
a
more
robust
race
than
the
inhabitants
of
central
and
southern
china
but
resemble
those
of
northern
china
save
that
their
eyes
are
horizontally
set
they
are
a
lively
and
enterprising
people
but
have
not
in
general
the
intellectual
or
business
ability
of
the
chinese
they
are
courteous
in
their
relations
with
strangers
the

the

the
earliest
traces
of
religious
thought
and
practice
in
china
point
to
a
simple
monotheism
there
was
a
divine
ruler
of
the
universe
abiding
on
high
beyond
the
ken
of
man
this
power
was
not
regarded
as
the
creator
of
the
human
race
but
as
a
supreme
being
to
whom
wickedness
was
abhorrent
and
virtuous
conduct
a
source
of
joy
and
who
dealt
out
rewards
and
punishments
with
unerring
justice
claiming
neither
love
nor
reverence
from
mankind
if
a
man
did
his
duty
towards
his
neighbour
he
might
pass
his
whole
time
on
earth
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
such
a
power
was
in
existence
unless
perchance
he
wished
to
obtain
some
good
or
attain
some
end
in
which
case
he
might
seek
to
propitiate
him
by
sacrifice
and
prayer
there
was
no
devil
to
tempt
man
astray
and
to
rejoice
in
his
fall
neither
was
there
any
belief
that
righteous
behaviour
in
this
world
would
lead
at
death
to
absorption
in
the
deity
to
god
understood
in
this
sense
the
people
gave
the
name
which
in
the
colloquial
language
was
used
of
the
sky
and
when
in
the
first
stages
of
the
written
character
it
became
necessary
to
express
the
idea
of
they
did
not
attempt
any
vague
picture
of
the
heavens
but
set
down
the
rude
outline
of
a
man
perhaps
about
this
period
the
title
or
supreme
ruler
came
into
vogue
as
synonymous
with
but
although
the
two
terms
were
synonyms
and
both
may
be
equally
rendered
by
god
there
is
nevertheless
an
important
distinction
to
be
observed
much
as
though
and
were
two
persons
in
one
substance
is
far
more
an
abstract
being
while
partakes
rather
of
the
nature
of
a
personal
god
whose
anthropomorphic
nature
is
much
more
strongly
accentuated
is
described
as
walking
and
talking
as
enjoying
the
flavour
of
sacrifices
as
pleased
with
music
and
dancing
in
his
honour
and
even
as
taking
sides
in
warfare
whereas
holds
aloof

in
an
impenetrable
majesty

from

sources
for
nothing
like
a
history
of
religion
is
to
be
found
in
chinese
literature
gradually
to
this
monotheistic
conception
was
added
a
worship
of
the
sun
moon
and
constellations
of
the
five
planets
and
of
such
noticeable
individual
stars
as

is
now

the
worship
of
ancestors
stretching
so
far
back
that
its
origin
is
not
discernible
in
such
historical
documents
as
we
possess
in
early
times
only
the
emperor
or
the
feudal
nobles
or
certain
high
officials
could
sacrifice
to
the
spirits

the
common
people
sacrificed
to
their
own
ancestors
and
to
the
spirits
of
their
own
homes
for
three
days
before
performing
such
sacrifices
a
strict
vigil
with
purification
was
maintained
and
by
the
expiration
of
that
time
from
sheer
concentration
of
thought
the
mourner
was
able
to
see
the
spirits
of
the
departed
and
at
the
sacrifice
next
day
seemed
to
hear
their
movements
and
even
the
murmur
of
their
sighs
ancestral
worship
in
china
has
always
been
and
still
is
worship
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
term
it
is
not
a
memorial
service
in
simple
honour
of
the
dead
but
sacrifices
are
offered
and
the
whole
ceremonial
is
performed
that
the
spirits
of
former
ancestors
may
be
induced
to
extend
their
protection
to
the
living
and
secure
to
them
as
many
as
possible
of
the
good
things
of

taoism
around
the
scanty
utterances
of
lao
tz
u
or
see
also
literature
an
attempt
was
made
by
later
writers
to
weave
a
scheme
of
thought
which
should
serve
to
satisfy
the
cravings
of
mortals
for
some
definite
solution
of
the
puzzle
of
life
lao
tz
u
himself
had
enunciated
a
criterion
which
he
called
or
the
way
from
which
is
derived
the
word
taoism
and
in
his
usual
paradoxical
style
he
had
asserted
that
the
secret
of
this
way
which
was
at
the
beginning
apparently
nothing
more
than
a
line
of
right
conduct
could
not
possibly
be
imparted
even
by
those
who
understood
it
his
disciples
however
of
later
days
proceeded
to
interpret
the
term
in
the
sense
of
the
absolute
the
first
cause
and
finally
as
one
in
whose
obliterating
unity
all
seemingly
opposed
conditions
of
time
and
space
were
indistinguishably
blended
this
one
the
source
of
human
life
was
placed
beyond
the
limits
of
the
visible
universe
and
for
human
life
to
return
thither
at
death
and
to
enjoy
immortality
it
was
only
necessary
to
refine
away
all
corporeal
grossness
by
following
the
doctrines
of
lao
tz
u
by
and
by
this
one
came
to
be
regarded
as
a
fixed
point
of
dazzling
luminosity
in
remote
ether
around
which
circled
for
ever
and
ever
in
the
supremest
glory
of
motion
the
souls
of
those
who
had
left
the
slough
of
humanity
behind
them
these
transcendental
notions
were
entirely
corrupted
at
a
very
early
date
by
the
introduction
of
belief
in
an
elixir
of
life
and
later
still
by
the
practice
of
alchemistic
experiments
opposed
by
buddhism
which
next
laid
a
claim
for
a
share
in
the
profits
of
popular
patronage
taoism
rapidly
underwent
a
radical
transformation
it
became
a
religion
borrowing
certain
ceremonial
vestments
liturgies
the
idea
of
a
hell
arrangement
of
temples
from
its
rival
which
rival
was
not
slow
in
returning
the
compliment
as
chu
hsi
said
buddhism
stole
the
best
features
of
taoism
taoism
stole
the
worst
features
of
buddhism
it
is
as
though
one
took
a
jewel
from
the
other
and
the
loser
recouped
the
loss
with
a
stone
at
the
present
day
there
is
not
much
to
choose
between
the
two
religions
which
flourish
peaceably
together
as
to
their
temples
priests
and
ceremonial
it
takes
an
expert
to
distinguish
one
from
the
other
buddhism
there
is
no
trustworthy
information
as
to
the
exact
date
at
which
buddhism
first
reached
china
it
is
related
that
the
emperor
ming
ti
had
a
dream
in
which
a
golden
man
appeared
to
him
and
this
mysterious
visitant
was
interpreted
by
the
emperor
brother
to
be
none
other
than
sh
kyamuni
buddha
the
divinity
of
the
west
this
shows
that
buddhism
must
then
have
been
known
to
the
chinese
at
any
rate
by
hearsay
the
earliest
alleged
appearance
of
buddhism
in
china
dates
from
when
certain
shamans
who
came
to
proselytize
were
seized
and
thrown
into
prison
they
escaped
through
the
miraculous
intervention
of
a
golden
man
who
came
to
them
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
opened
their
prison
doors

kuan
a
writer
of
the
sung
dynasty
quotes
in

passages
to
support

view
that

was
known
in

some
centuries
before

reign
of
ming

among

the
following
from

of

occurred
the
burning
of

books
it
is
however
convenient
to
begin
with
the
alleged
dream
of
ming
ti
as
it
was
only
subsequent
to
that
date
that
buddhism
became
a
recognized
religion
of
the
people
it
is
certain
that
in
a
mission
of
eighteen
members
was
despatched
to
khotan
to
make
inquiries
on
the
subject
and
that
in
the
mission
returned
bringing
buddhist
writings
and
images
and
accompanied
by
an
indian
priest
kashiapmadanga
who
was
followed
shortly
afterwards
by
another
priest
gobharana
a
temple
was
built
for
these
two
at
then
the
capital
of
china
and
they
settled
down
to
the
work
of
translating
portions
of
the
buddhist
scriptures
into
chinese
but
all
that
now
remains
of
their
work
is
the
s
tra
of
sections
translated
by
kashiapmadanga
during
the
next
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
an
unbroken
line
of
foreign
priests
came
to
china
to
continue
the
task
of
translation
and
to
assist
in
spreading
the
faith
such
work
was
indeed
entirely
in
their
hands
for
until
the
century
the
chinese
people
were
prohibited
from
taking
orders
as
priests
but
by
that
date
buddhism
had
taken
a
firm
hold
upon
the
masses
and
many
chinese
priests
were
attracted
towards
india
despite
the
long
and
dangerous
journey
partly
to
visit
the
birthplace
of
the
creed
and
to
see
with
their
own
eyes
the
scenes
which
had
so
fired
their
imaginations
and
partly
in
the
hope
of
adding
to
the
store
of
books
and
images
already
available
in
china
see
literature
geography
and
still
the
train
of
indian
missionaries
moving
in
the
opposite
direction
did
not
cease
in
kumarajiva
the
nineteenth
of
the
western
patriarchs
and
translator
of
the
diamond
s
tra
finally
took
up
his
residence
at
the
court
of
the
emperor
yao
hsing
in
he
became
state
preceptor
and
dictated
his
commentaries
on
the
sacred
books
of
buddhism
to
some
eight
hundred
priests
besides
composing
a
on
reality
and
semblance
dying
in
his
body
was
cremated
as
is
still
usual
with
priests
but
his
tongue
which
had
done
such
eminent
service
during
life
remained
unharmed
in
the
midst
of
the
flames
in
the
year
b
dhidharma
or
as
he
is
affectionately
known
to
the
chinese
being
also
called
the
white
buddha
reached
canton
bringing
with
him
the
sacred
bowl
of
the
buddhist
patriarchate
of
which
he
was
the
last
representative
in
the
west
and
the
first
to
hold
office
in
the
east
summoned
to
nanking
he
offended
the
emperor
by
asserting
that
real
merit
lay
not
in
works
but
solely
in
purity
and
wisdom
combined
he
therefore
retired
to
crossing
the
swollen
waters
of
the
yangtsze
on
a
reed
a
feat
which
has
ever
since
had
a
great
fascination
for
chinese
painters
and
poets
there
he
spent
the
rest
of
his
life
teaching
that
religion
was
not
to
be
learnt
from
books
but
that
man
should
seek
and
find
the
buddha
in
his
own
heart
thus
buddhism
gradually
made
its
way
it
had
to
meet
first
of
all
the
bitter
hostility
of
the
taoists
and
secondly
the
fitful
patronage
and
opposition
of
the
court
several
emperors
and
empresses
were
infatuated
supporters
of
the
faith
one
even
went
so
far
as
to
take
vows
and
lead
the
life
of
an
ascetic
further
insisting
that
to
render
full
obedience
to
the
buddhist
commandment
thou
shalt
not
kill
the
sacrificial
animals
were
to
be
made
of
dough
other
emperors
instigated
by
confucian
advisers
went
to
the
opposite
extreme
of
persecution
closed
all
religious
houses
confiscated
their
property
and
forced
the
priests
and
nuns
to
return
to
the
world
from
about
the
century
onwards
buddhism
has
enjoyed
comparative
immunity
from
attack
or
restriction
and
it
now
covers
the
chinese
empire
from
end
to
end
the
form
under
which
it
appears
in
china
is
to
some
extent
of
local
growth
that
is
to
say
the
chinese
have
added
and
subtracted
not
a
little
to
and
from
the
parent
stock
the
cleavage
which
took
place
under
kanishka
ruler
of
the
empire
about
the
century
divided
buddhism
into
the
mah
y
na
or
greater
vehicle
and
the
hin
y
na
as
it
is
somewhat
contemptuously
styled
or
lesser
vehicle
the
latter
was
the
nearer
of
the
two
to
the
buddhism
of
sh
kyamuni
and
exhibits
rather
the
mystic
and
esoteric
sides
of
the
faith
the
former
which
spread
northwards
and
on
to
nepaul
tibet
china
mongolia
and
japan
leaving
southern
india
burma
and
siam
to
its
rival
began
early
to
lean
towards
the
deification
of
buddha
as
a
personal
saviour
new
buddhas
and
b
dhisatvas
were
added
and
new
worlds
were
provided
for
them
to
live
in
in
china
especially
there
was
an
enormous
extension
of
the
mythological
element
in
fact
the
mah
y
na
system
of
buddhism
inspired
as
has
been
observed
by
a
progressive
spirit
but
without
contradicting
the
inner
significance
of
the
teachings
of
buddha
broadened
its
scope
and
assimilated
other
beliefs
whenever
this
could
be
done
to
the
advantage
of
those
who
came
within
its
influence
such
is
the
form
of
this
religion
which
prevails
in
china
of
which
however
the
chinese
layman
understands
nothing
he
goes
to
a
temple
worships
the
gods
with
prostrations
lighted
candles
incense
to
secure
his
particular
ends
at
the
moment
he
may
even
listen
to
a
service
chanted
in
a
foreign
tongue
and
just
as
incomprehensible
to
the
priests
as
to
himself
he
pays
his
fees
and
departs
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
history
or
dogmas
of
the
religion
to
which
he
looks
for
salvation
in
a
future
state
all
such
knowledge
and
there
is
now
not
much
of
it
is
confined
to
a
few
of
the
more
cultured
priests
mardaism
the
century
seems
to
have
been
notable
in
the
religious
history
of
china
early
in
that
century
mazdaism
or
the
religion
of
zoroaster
based
upon
the
worship
of
fire
was
introduced
into
china
and
in
the
first
temple
under
that
denomination
was
built
at
in
shensi
then
the
capital
but
the
harvest
of
converts
was
insignificant
the
religion
failed
to
hold
its
ground
and
in
the
century
disappeared
altogether
mahommedanism
mahommedans
first
settled
in
china
in
the
year
of
the
mission
under
a
maternal
uncle
of
mahomet
who
was
sent
with
presents
to
the
emperor
travelled
by
sea
to
canton
and
thence
overland
to
the
capital
where
he
was
well
received
the
first
mosque
was
built
at
canton
where
after
several
restorations
it
still
exists
another
mosque
was
erected
in
but
many
of
the
mahommedans
went
to
china
merely
as
traders
and
afterwards
returned
to
their
own
country
the
true
stock
of
the
present
chinese
mahommedans
was
a
small
army
of
arab
soldiers
sent
by
the
caliph
abu
giafar
in
to
aid
in
putting
down
a
rebellion
these
soldiers
had
permission
to
settle
in
china
where
they
married
native
wives
and
four
centuries
later
with
the
conquests
of
jenghiz
khan
large
numbers
of
arabs
penetrated
into
the
empire
and
swelled
the
mahommedan
community
its
members
are
now
indistinguishable
from
the
general
population
they
are
under
no
civic
disabilities
and
are
free
to
open
mosques
wherever
they
please
so
long
as
in
common
with
buddhists
and
taoists
they
exhibit
the
tablet
of
the
emperor
sovereignty
in
some
conspicuous
position
nestorianism
in
the
nestorians
sent
a
mission
to
china
and
introduced
christianity
under
the
name
of
the
luminous
doctrine
in
they
were
allowed
to
settle
at
and
in
an
imperial
decree
was
issued
stating
that
olopun
a
nestorian
priest
who
is
casually
mentioned
as
a
persian
had
presented
a
form
of
religion
which
his
majesty
had
carefully
examined
and
had
found
to
be
in
every
way
satisfactory
and
that
it
would
henceforth
be
permissible
to
preach
this
new
doctrine
within
the
boundaries
of
the
empire
further
the
establishment
of
a
monastery
was
authorized
to
be
served
by
priests
for
more
than
a
century
after
this
nestorian
christianity
seems
to
have
flourished
in
china
in
the
famous
nestorian
tablet
giving
a
rough
outline
of
the
object
and
scope
of
the
faith
was
set
up
at
the
modern
fu
disappearing
soon
afterwards
in
the
political
troubles
which
laid
the
city
in
ruins
to
be
brought
to
light
again
in
by
father
semedo
the
genuineness
of
this
tablet
was
for
many
years
in
dispute
voltaire
renan
and
others
of
lesser
fame
regarding
it
as
a
pious
jesuit
fraud
but
all
doubts
on
the
subject
have
now
been
dispelled
by
the
exhaustive
monograph
of
père
havret
entitled
stèle
de
the
date
of
the
tablet
seems
to
mark
the
zenith
of
nestorian
christianity
in
china
after
this
date
it
began
to
decay
marco
polo
refers
to
it
as
existing
in
the
century
but
then
it
fades
out
of
sight
leaving
scant
traces
in
chinese
literature
of
ever
having
existed
manichaeism
the
manichaeans
worshippers
of
the
chaldaean
mani
or
man
s
who
died
about
appear
to
have
found
their
way
to
china
in
the
year
in
an
envoy
from
tokharestan
reached
bringing
a
letter
to
the
emperor
in
which
a
request
was
made
that
an
astronomer
who
accompanied
the
mission
might
be
permitted
to
establish
places
of
worship
for
persons
of
the
manichaean
faith
subsequently
a
number
of
such
chapels
were
opened
at
various
centres
but
little
is
known
of
the
history
of
this
religion
which
is
often
confounded
by
chinese
writers
with

fate

which
it

have

they
seem
to
have
lived
peaceably
enjoying
the
protection
of
the
authorities
and
making
some
slight
efforts
to
spread
their
tenets
there
their
descendants
were
found
a
dwindling
community
by
the
jesuit
fathers
of
the
century
and
there
again
they
were
visited
in
by
a
protestant
mission

succeeded
in
obtaining
from
them
hebrew
rolls
of
parts
of
the
pentateuch
in
the

after
this
it
was
generally
believed
that
the
few
remaining
stragglers
who
seemed
to
be
entirely
ignorant
of
everything
connected
with
their
faith
had
become
merged
in
the
ordinary
population
a
recent
traveller
however
asserts
that
in
he
found
at
fu
a
jewish
community
the
members
of

of
the
vast
majority
of

not

the
chief
merit
of
the
system
was
that
it
developed

memory
and
the

faculty
for
secondary

the
successful
candidates
were
also
called

the
first
education
on
western
lines
was
given
by
the
roman
catholic
missionaries
in
they
founded
a
college
for
the
education
of
native
priests
they
also
founded

maintained

and

mainly
if
not

for

benefit
of
their
converts
the
protestant
missions
followed
the
example
of
the
roman
catholics
but
a
new
departure
which
has
had
a
wide
success
was
initiated
by
the
american
protestant
missionary
societies
in
founding
schools
primary
and

colleges

western
education
was
given
equally
to

or

of

and
opened
special
schools
for
their
instruction
missionary
effort
apart
the
first
step
towards
western
education
was
the
establishment
of
two
colleges
in
one
at
peking
the
other
at
canton
in
connexion
with
the
imperial
maritime
customs
these
institutions
were
known
as
wen
kwan
and
were
provided
with
a
staff
of
foreign
professors
and
teachers
these
colleges
were
mainly
schools
of
languages
to
enable
young
chinese
to
qualify
as
interpreters
in
english
french
similar
schools
were
established
at
canton
fuchow
and
one
or
two
other
places
with
but
indifferent
results
a
more
promising
plan
was
conceived
in
or
thereabouts
by
the
then
viceroy
of
nanking
who
sent
a
batch
of
thirty
or
forty
students
to
america
to
receive
a
regular
training
on
the
understanding
that
on
their
return
they
would
receive
official
appointments
the
promise
was
not
kept
a
report
was
spread
that
these
students
were
becoming
too
much
americanized
they
were
hastily
recalled
and
when
they
returned
they
were
left
in
obscurity
the
next
step
was
taken
by
the
viceroy
chang
after
the
war
of
the
viceroy
wrote
a
book
only
which
he
circulated
throughout
the
empire
and
in
which
he
strongly
advocated
a
reform
of
the
traditional
educational
system
his
scheme
was
to
make
chinese
learning
the
foundation
on
which
a
western
education
should
be
imparted
the
book
was
one
of
the
factors
in
the
reform
movement
and
chang
proposals
were
condemned
when
that
movement
was
suppressed
but
after
the
boxer
rising
the
peking
government
adopted
his
views
and
in
regulations
were
issued
for
the
reform
of
the
old
system
of
public
instruction
a
university
on
western
lines
was
established
in
that
year
at
peking
the
wen
kwan
at
the
capital
being
incorporated
in
it
the
new
educational
movement
gained
enormously
in
strength
as
the
result
of
the
war
and
in
a
new
system
theoretically
almost
perfect
was
established
the
new
system
comprises
the
study
of
the
chinese
language
literature
and
composition
modern
sciences
history
and
geography
foreign
languages
gymnastics
drill
and
in
the
higher
grades
political
economy
and
civil
and
international
law
by
primary
and
secondary
government
schools
and
schools
for
special
subjects
such
as
agriculture
and
engineering
had
been
established
in
considerable
numbers
in
every
province
an
imperial
university
was
also
established
the
imperial
university
at
peking
now
teaches
not
only
languages
and
chinese
subjects
but
also
law
chemistry
mathematics
a
medical
school
was
founded
at
peking
in
through
the
energy
of
british
protestant
missionaries
and
is
called
the
union
medical
college
when
in
the
united
states
finding
that
the
indemnity
for
the
boxer
outrages
awarded
her
was
excessive
agreed
to
forgo
the
payment
of
china
undertook
to
spend
an
equal
amount
in
sending
students
to
america
the
general
verdict
of
foreign
observers
on
the
working
of
the
new
system
up
to
was
that
in
many
instances
the
teaching
was
ineffective
but
there
were
notable
exceptions
the
best
teachers
next
to
europeans
were
foreign
or
chinese
the
japanese
employed
as
teachers
were
often
ignorant
of
chinese
and
were
not
as
a
rule
very
successful
see
further
a
remarkable
indication
of
the
thirst
for
western
learning
and
culture
was
the
translation
into

the
which
is
sometimes
called
the
oldest
paper
in
the
world
is
not
a
newspaper
in
the
ordinary
sense
but
merely
a
court
gazette
for
publishing
imperial
decrees
and
such
public
documents
as
the
government
may
wish
to
give
out
it
never
contains

nor
any

the
first
genuine
native
newspaper
was
published
at
shanghai
about
it
was
termed
the

and
was
a
chinese
speculation
under
foreign
protection
the
first
editor
being
an
englishman
it
was
some
years
before
it
made
much
headway

success
came
and
it
was
followed
by
various
imitators
some
published
at

some
at

at

were
over

monthly

the
effect
of
this
mass
of

on
the
public
mind
of

is
of
importance
the
attitude
of
the
central
government
towards
the
native
press
is
somewhat
undefined
official
registration
of
a
newspaper
is
required
before
postal
facilities
are
given
there
are
no
press
laws
but
as
every
official
is
a
law
unto
himself
in
these
matters
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
him
from
summarily
suppressing
an
obnoxious
newspaper

putting
the

in

the
revoked

and
declared
that
the
public
discussion
of
affairs
of
state
in
the
newspapers
was
an
impertinence
and
ought
to
be
suppressed
nevertheless
the
newspapers
continued
to
flourish
and
their
outspoken
criticism
had
a
salutary
effect
on
the
public
and
on
the
government
the
official
classes
seem
to
have
become
alarmed
at
the
independent
attitude
of
the
newspapers
but
instead
of
a
campaign
of
suppression
the
method
was
adopted
about
of
bringing
the
vernacular
press
under
official
control
this
was
accomplished
chiefly
by
the
purchase
of
the
newspapers
by
the
mandarins
with
the
result
that
at
the
beginning
of
there
was
said
to
be
hardly
an
independent
native
daily
newspaper
left
in
china
the
use
of
government
funds
to
subsidize
or
to
purchase
newspapers
and
thus
to
stifle
or
mislead
public
opinion
provoked
strong
protests
from
members
of
the
nanking
provincial
council
at
its
first
sitting
in
the
autumn
of
the
appropriation
by
the
shanghai
of

belonging
to
the

for
subsidizing

impeachment
by

china

an
agricultural
country
the
great
majority

very
small

does
not

is
also
a
favourite
pursuit
the
chinese
farmer
if
his
methods
be
primitive
is
diligent
and
persevering
in
the
richer
and
most
thickly
populated
districts
terraces
are
raised
on
the
mountain
sides
and
even
the
tops
of
lofty
hills
are
cultivated
the
nature
of
the
soil
and
means
of
irrigation
as
well
as
climate
are
determining
factors
in
the
nature
of
the
crops
grown
rice
and
cotton
for
example
are
grown
in
the
most
northern
as
well
as
the
most
southern
districts
of
china
this
is
however
exceptional
and
each
climatic
region
has
its
characteristic
cultures
soils
the
loess
soil
see
is
the
chief
element
in
determining
the
agricultural
products
of
north
china
loess
soil
bears
excellent
crops
and
not
merely
on
the
lower
grounds
but
at
altitudes
of
and
ft
wherever
loess
is
found
the
peasant
can
live
and
thrive
only
one
thing
is
essential
and
that
is
the
annual
rainfall
as
owing
to
the
porous
nature
of
loess
no
artificial
irrigation
is
possible
if
the
rain
fails
the
crops
must
necessarily
fail
thus
seasons
of
great
famine
alternate
with
seasons
of
great
plenty
it
appears
also
that
the
soil
needs
little
or
no
manuring
and
very
little
tillage
from
its
extremely
friable
nature
it
is
easily
broken
up
and
thus
a
less
amount
of
labour
is
required
than
in
other
parts
the
extreme
porosity
of
the
soil
probably
also
accounts
for
the
length
of
time
it
will
go
on
bearing
crops
without
becoming
exhausted
the
rainfall
penetrating
deeply
into
the
soil
in
the
absence
of
stratification
comes
into
contact
with
the
moisture
retained
below
which
holds
in
solution
whatever
inorganic
salts
the
soil
may
contain
and
thus
the
vegetation
has
an
indefinite
store
to
draw
upon
there
is
no
one
dominant
deposit

china
where
red
sandstone
and
limestone
formations
are
frequent

not
possible

high
elevations

in

the
soil
is
exceedingly
fertile
while
the
lower
slopes
of

also
cultivated

crop
in

can
be
raised

especially
in

has
been

every
district

chiefly
cultivated
in
the
following
provinces
northern

and
the
poppy
is
first
mentioned
in
chinese
literature
in
a
book
written
in
the
first
half
of
the
century
and
its
medicinal
qualities
are
referred
to
in
the
of
it
was
not
then
nor
for
centuries
later
grown
in
china
for
the
preparation
of
opium
there
is
no
evidence
to
show
that
the
chinese
ever
took
opium
in
the
shape
of
pills
otherwise
than
medicinally
the
cultivation
of
the
poppy
for
the
manufacture
of
opium
began
in
china
in
the
century
but
it
was
not
until
after
when
the
importation
of
foreign
opium
was
declared
illegal
that
the
plant
was
cultivated
on
an
extensive
scale
after
large
areas
which
had
been
devoted
to
the
poppy
were
given
over
to
other
crops
in
consequence
of
the
imperial
edict
aimed
at
the
suppression
of

the
mineral
resources
of
china
are
great
but
the
government
has
shown
a
marked
repugnance
to
allow
foreigners
to
work
mines
and
the
mineral
wealth
has
been
very
inadequately
exploited
mining
operations
are
controlled
by
the
board
of
commerce
in
this
board
drew
up
regulations
respecting
the
constitution
of

other
companies
they
contained
many
features
against
which
foreign
powers
protested
coal
coal
iron
copper

the
principal

there
are
also
extensive
deposits
of

other
minerals
in

proper
the
largest
coal
measures
are
found
in

there
are
also
important
coalfields
in
and
and
almost
all
of
the
seven
other
provinces
have
also
coal
measures
of
more
or
less
value
the
lack
of
transport
facilities
as
well
as
the
aversion
from
the
employment
of
foreign
capital
has
greatly
hindered
the
development
of
mining
numerous
small
mines
have
been
worked
for
a
long
period
by
the
natives
in
the
province
of
there
are
two
principal
local
fields
in
this
province
one
lying
in
the
basin
of
the
lei
river

yielding
anthracite
and
the
other
in
the
basin
of
the
siang
river
yielding
bituminous
coal
both
rivers
drain
into
the
yangtsze
and
there
is
thus
an
easy
outlet
by
water
to
hankow
the
quality
of
the
coal
however
is
inferior
as
the
stratification
has
been
much
disturbed
and
the
have
been
in
consequence
crushed
and
broken
the
largest
coalfield
in
china
lies
in
the
province
of
coal
and
iron
have
here
been
worked
by
the
natives
from
time
immemorial
but
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
transport
they
have
attained
only
a
limited
local
circulation
the
whole
of
southern
extending
over

is
one
vast
coalfield
and
contains
according
to
the
estimate
of
baron
von
richthofen
enough
coal
to
last
the
world
at
the
present
rate
of
consumption
for
several
thousand
years
the
which
are
from

in
thickness
rest
conformably
on
a
substructure
of
limestone
the
stratification
is
throughout
undisturbed
and
practically
horizontal
as
the
limestone
bed
is
raised
some
above
the
neighbouring
plain
the
crop
out
in
all
directions
mining
is
thus
carried
on
by
adits
driven
into
the
face
of
the
formation
rendering
the
mining
of
the
coal
extremely
easy
the
coalfield
is
divided
into
two
by
a
mountain
range
of
ancient
granitic
formation
running
and
termed

it
is
of
anterior
date
to
the
limestone
and
coal
formations
and
has
not
affected
the
uniformity
of
the
stratification
but
it
has
this
peculiarity
that
the
coal
on
the
east
side
is
anthracite
and
that
on
the
west
side
is
bituminous
a
concession
to
work
coal

in
certain
specified
districts
in
this
area
was
granted
to
a
british
company
the
peking
syndicate
together
with
the
right
to
connect

in
reality
steadily
growing
the

however

has
been
driven
out

by

the
railways
since

century
having
become
a
very
important
factor
in
the

agreed
that
all

should
be
open
to

and
native
steamers

the
era
of

administration
a
short
line
of
railway
between
shanghai
and
wusung
was
opened
in
the
fate
of
this
pioneer
railway
may
be
mentioned
as
an
introduction
to
what
follows
the
railway
was
really
built
without
any
regular
permission
from
the
chinese
government
but
it
was
hoped
that
once
finished
and
working
the
irregularity
would
be
overlooked
in
view
of
the
manifest
benefit
to
the
people
this
might
have
been
accomplished
but
for
an
unfortunate
accident
which
happened
on
the
line
a
few
months
after
it
was
opened
a
chinaman
was
run
over
and
killed
and
this
event
of
course
intensified
the
official
opposition
and
indeed
threatened
to
bring
about
a
riot
the
working
of
the
line
was
stopped
by
order
of
the
british
minister
and
thereupon
negotiations
were
entered
into
with
a
view
to
selling
the
line
to
the
chinese
government
a
bargain
was
struck
sufficiently
favourable
to
the
foreign
promoters
of
the
line
and
it
was
further
agreed
that
pending
payment
of
the
instalments
which
were
spread
over
a
year
the
line
should
continue
to
be
worked
by
the
company
the
expectation
was
that
when
the
officials
once
got
the
line
into
their
own
hands
and
found
it
a
paying
concern
they
would
continue
to
run
it
in
their
own
interest
not
so
however
did
things
fall
out
the
very
day
that
the
twelve
months
were
up
the
line
was
closed
the
engines
were
dismantled
the
rails
and
sleepers
were
torn
up
and
the
whole
concern
was
shipped
off
to
the
distant
island
of
formosa
where
carriages
axles
and
all
the
rest
of
the
gear
were
dumped
on
the
shore
and
left
for
the
most
part
to
disappear
in
the
mud
the
spacious
area
of
the
shanghai
station
was
cleared
of
its
buildings
and
thereon
was
erected
a
temple
to
the
queen
of
heaven
by
way
of
purifying
the
sacred
soil
of
china
from
such
abomination
this
put
a
stop
for
nearly
twenty
years
to
all
efforts
on
the
part
of
foreigners
to
introduce
railways
into
china
the
next
step
in
railway
construction
was
taken
by
the
chinese
themselves
and
on
the
initiative
of
li
in
a
company
was
formed
under
official
patronage
and
it
built
a
short
line
to
connect
the
of
in
with
the
mouth
of
the
peiho
river
at
taku
the
government
next
authorized
the
formation
of
a
native
merchants
company
under
official
control
to
build
a
line
from
taku
to
tientsin
which
was
opened
to
traffic
in
it
was
not
however
till
nine
years
later
viz
in
that
the
line
was
completed
as
far
as
peking
a
british
engineer
mr
kinder
was
responsible
for
the
construction
of
the
railway
meantime
however
the
extension
had
been
continued
along
the
coast
as
far
as
and
a
farther
extension
subsequently
connected
with
the
treaty
port
of
the
money
for
these
extensions
was
mostly
found
by
the
government
and
the
whole
line
is
now
known
as
the
imperial
northern
railway
the
length
of
the
line
is
meanwhile
the
high
officials
of
the
empire
had
gradually
been
brought
round
to
the
idea
that
railway
development
was
in
itself
a
good
thing
chang
then
viceroy
of
the
canton
provinces
memorialized
strongly
in
this
sense
with
the
condition
however
that
the
railways
should
be
built
with
chinese
capital
and
of
chinese
materials
in
particular
he
urged
the
making
of
a
line
to
connect
peking
with
hankow
for
strategic
purposes
the
government
took
him
at
his
word
and
he
was
transferred
from
canton
to
hankow
with
authority
to
proceed
forthwith
with
his
railway
true
to
his
purpose
he
at
once
set
to
work
to
construct
at
hankow
smelting
furnaces
rolling
mills
and
all
the
machinery
necessary
for
turning
out
steel
rails
locomotives
were
erected
several
years
were
wasted
over
this
preliminary
work
and
over
sterling
was
spent
only
to
find
that
the
works
after
all
were
a
practical
failure
steel
rails
could
be
made
but
at
a
cost
two
or
three
times
what
they
could
be
procured
for
in
europe
after
the
japanese
war
the
hope
of
building
railways
with
chinese
capital
was
abandoned
a
prominent
official
named
sheng
was
appointed
of
railways
and
empowered
to
enter
into
negotiations
with
foreign
financiers
for
the
purpose
of
raising
loans
it
was
still
hoped
that
at
least
the
main
control
would
remain
in
chinese
hands
but
the
diplomatic
pressure
of
france
and
russia
caused
even
that
to
be
given
up
and
great
britain
insisting
on
equal
privileges
for
her
subjects
the
future
of
railways
in
china
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
various
concessionaires
but
after
the
defeat
of
russia
by
japan
the
theory
of
the
undivided
chinese
control
of
railways
was
resuscitated
the
new
spirit
was
exemplified
in
the
contracts
for
the
financing
and
construction
of
three
railways
the
line
in
and
the
and
the
lines
in
in
the
first
of
these
instances
the
railway
was
mortgaged
as
security
for
the
loan
raised
for
its
construction
and
its
finance
and
working
were
to
be
modelled
on
the
arrangements
obtaining
in
the
case
of
the
imperial
northern
railway
under
which
the
administration
while
vested
in
the
chinese
government
was
supervised
by
a
british
accountant
and
chief
engineer
in
the
other
two
instances
however
no
such
security
was
offered
the
chinese
government
undertook
the
unfettered
administration
of
the
foreign
capital
invested
in
the
lines
and
the
europeans
connected
with
these
works
became
simply
chinese
employés
moreover
in
the
line
was
redeemed
from
belgian
concessionaires
a
loan
of
being
raised
for
the
purpose
in
london
and
paris
in
that
year
there
was
much
popular
outcry
against
foreign
concessionaires
being
allowed
to
carry
out
the
terms
of
their
contract
and
the
british
and
chinese
corporation
in
consequence
parted
with
their
concession
for
the
and
railway
making
instead
a
loan
of
to
the
ministry
of
communications
for
the
provinces
through
which
the
line
would
run
a
double
difficulty
was
encountered
in
the
construction
and
management
of
the
railways
the
reconciliation
of
the
privileges
accorded
to
foreign
syndicates
and
governments
with
the
recovery
of
rights
campaign
and
the
reconciliation
of
the
claims
of
the
central
government
at
peking
with
the
demands
of
the
provincial
authorities
as
to
the
foreigners
great
britain
france
germany
the
united
states
russia
and
japan
all
had
claims
and
concessions
many
of
them
conflicting
while
as
between
peking
and
the
provinces
there
was
a
quarrel
mainly
concerned
with
the
spoils
and
squeezes
to
be
obtained
by
railway
construction
in
some
instances
the
provinces
proved
more
powerful
than
the
central
government
as
in
the
case
of
the
line
and
notably
in
the
matter
of
the
nanking
railway
in
that
case
the
provincial
authorities
overrode
the
central

with
the
result
that
for
wholesale
jobbery
waste
and
mismanagement
the
enterprise
acquired
unenviable
notoriety
in
a
land
where
these
things
are
generally
condoned
the
good
record
of
one
or
two
lines
notwithstanding
the
management
of
the
railways
under
chinese
control
had
proved
up
to
inefficient
and
corrupt
nevertheless
so
great
was
the
economic
development
following
the
opening
of
the

that
in
chinese
hands
the
railway
yielded
a
profit
the

systems
the
main
scheme
of
the
railway
systems
of
china
is
simple
it
consists
of
lines
more
or
less
parallel
running
roughly
north
and
south
linked
by
cross
lines
with
coast
ports
or
abutting
on
navigable
rivers
one
great
east
and
west
line
will
run
through
central
china
from
hankow
to
connexion
with

is
afforded
by
the
main

which
has
a
general
east

west
direction
from
harbin
on
this
railway
a
branch
runs
south

which
since
has
become
an

thence
one

goes

arthur
another
to

yalu
and
korea
a
third
south
and
west
to
tientsin
and

a
branch
from
the

goes
round
the
head
of
the

it

very

nearly
all
are
badly

speaking
generally
the
government
spends
nothing
in
keeping
either
the

or

in
repair
the
roads
in
several
instances
are
subsidiary
to
the
canals
and
navigable
rivers
as
a
means
of

the
ancient

routes
were
twelve
in

viz
the

of
the

penetrates
to
where
it
now
has
to
meet
the
competition
of
the
french
railway
from
tong
king
and
the
cheling
pass
route
from

is
so
named
as
it
crosses
that
pass
high
to
reach
the
of

on
an
affluent

thus
connects
with
the

the

of
this

whence
in
former
times
the
teas
of
oonam

oopaek
reached

has
been
largely
diverted

the

now
mainly
served
by

though
the

is
still
carried
by

and
the

is
now
adequately
served
by

there
remains
the

the
government
maintains
a
number
of
courier
roads
which
like
the
main
trade
roads
keep
approximately
to
a
straight

these
courier
roads
are
sometimes
cut
in
the
steep
sides
of
mountains
or
run
through
them
in

they
are
in

but
as
a
rule
roads
are
left
to

x
iv
government
and
administration
changes
in
the
traditional
form
of
government
in

an
autocracy
based
on
parental
rule
were
initiated
in
when
a
commission
was
appointed
to
study
the
forms
of
government
in
other
countries
on
the
of
september
an
imperial
edict
was
issued
in
which
the
establishment
of
parliamentary
institutions
in
china
was
foreshadowed
in
an
advisory
council
as
a
sort
of
to
representative
government
was
established
by
another
edict
on
the
of
august
an
edict
announced
the
convocation
of
a
parliament
in
the
ninth
year
from
that
date
an
edict
of
the
of
december
reaffirmed
that
of
the
of
august
an
edict
of
the
of
october
fixed
the
classes
from
which
an
imperial
assembly
or
senate
was
to
be
selected
and
an
edict
of
the
of
may
gave
the
names
of
the
senators
all
of
whom
had
been
nominated
by
the
throne
the
assembly
as
thus
constituted
consisted
of
members
drawn
from
eight
classes
princes
and
nobles
of
the
imperial
house

manchu
and
chinese

members
the
national
assembly
which
was
opened
by
the
regent
on
the
of
october
thus
contained
the
elements
of
a
parliament
the
edict
summoning
the
assembly
contained
the
following
exhortations
the
members
should
understand
that
this
assemblage
of
the
senate
is
an
unprecedented
undertaking
in
china
and
will
be
the
forerunner
of
the
creation
of
a
parliament
they
are
earnestly
desired
to
devote
to
it
their
patriotism
and
sincerity
to
observe
proper
order
and
to
fulfil
their
duties
in
representing
public
opinion
thus
it
is
hoped
that
our
sincere
wish
to
effect
constitutional
reforms
in
their
proper
order
and
to
aim
at
success
may
be
duly
satisfied
concurrently
with
these
steps
towards
a
fundamental
alteration
in
the
method
of
government
changes
were
made
in
many
departments
of
the
state
and
an
elective
element
was
introduced
into
the
provincial
administrations
the
old
conception
of
government
with
such
modifications
as
had
been
made
up
to
are
set
forth
below
the
chinese
conception
of
government
the
laws
of
the
state
prescribe
the
government
of
the
country
to
be
based
on
the
government
of
the
family
the
emperor
is
the
sole
and
supreme
head
of
the
state
his
will
being
absolute
alike
in
the
highest
affairs
and
in
the
humblest
details
of
private
life
the
highest
form
of
legislation
was
an
imperial
decree
whether
promulgated
in
general
terms
or
to
meet
a
special
case
in
either
form
it
was
the
law
of
the
land
and
no
privilege
or
prescriptive
right
could
be
pleaded
against
it
all
officers
of
state
all
judges
and
magistrates
hold
their
offices
entirely
at
the
imperial
pleasure
they
can
be
dismissed
degraded
punished
without
reason
assigned
and
without
form
of
trial
even
without
knowing
by
whom
or
of
what
they
are
accused
the
monarch
has
an
advisory
council
but
he
is
not
bound
by
its
advice
nor
need
he
pretend
that
he
is
acting
by
and
with
its
advice
and
concurrence
this
condition
of
affairs
dates
back
to
a
primitive
state
of
society
which
probably
existed
among
the
chinese
who
first
developed
a
civilized
form
of
government
that
this
system
should
have
been
maintained
in
china
through
many
centuries
is
a
fact
into
the
causes
of
which
it
is
worth
while
to
inquire
we
find
it
pictured
in
the
records
which
make
up
the
of
and
we
find
it
enforced
in
the
writings
of
the
great
apostle
of
patriarchal
institutions
confucius
and
in
all
the
other
works
which
go
to
make
up
the
confucian
canon
the
reverence
with
which
these
scriptures
are
viewed
was
the
principal
means
of
perpetuating
the
primitive
form
of
chinese
imperialism
the
contents
of
their
pages
formed
the
study
of
every
schoolboy
and
supplied
the
themes
at
the
competitive
examinations
through
which
every
one
had
to
pass
who
sought
an
official
career
thus
the
mind
of
the
nation
was
constantly
and
almost
exclusively
turned
towards
them
and
their
dogmas
became
part
and
parcel
of
the
national
training
the
whole
theory
of
government
is
the
embodiment
of
parental
love
and
filial
piety
as
the
people
are
the
children
of
the
emperor
so
is
he
the
or
the
son
of
heaven
the
emperor
in
practice
the
arbitrary
power
of
the
emperor
is
tempered
in
several
ways
firstly
although
the
constitution
conferred
this
absolute
and
unchecked
power
on
the
emperor
it
was
not
for
his
gratification
but
that
he
might
exercise
it
for
the
good
of
his
people
he
rules
by
divine
authority
and
as
the
vicegerent
of
heaven
upon
earth
if
he
rules
corruptly
or
unjustly
heaven
will
send
disasters
and
calamity
on
the
people
as
a
reproof
if
the
rule
becomes
tyrannical
heaven
may
withdraw
its
favour
entirely
and
then
rebellion
may
be
justified
the
manchu
dynasty
came
to
the
throne
as
foreign
conquerors
nevertheless
they
base
their
right
to
rule
not
on
the
power
of
the
sword
but
on
divine
approval
on
this
moral
ground
they
claim
the
obedience
of
their
subjects
and
submit
themselves
to
the
corresponding
obligations
the
emperor
unless
he
has
gained
the
throne
by
conquest
is
selected
by
his
predecessor
or
by
the
imperial
family
in
conclave
he
is
usually
a
son
but
seldom
the
eldest
son
of
his
predecessor
and
need
not
be
the
child
of
the
though
other
things
being
equal
a
son
of
the
empress
is
preferred
failing
a
son
another
prince
of
the
imperial
house
is
chosen
the
choice
being
properly
among
the
princes
of
a
generation
below
that
of
the
preceding
emperor
so
that
the
new
emperor
may
be
adopted
as
the
son
of
his
predecessor
and
perform
for
him
the
due
ceremonies
at
the
ancestral
tablets
apart
from
this
the
emperor
worships
only
at
the
altar
of
heaven
leaving
buddhism
taoism
and
any
other
form
of
worship
to
his
subjects
the
emperor
sacrifices
and
prayers
to
heaven
are
conducted
with
great
parade
and
ceremony
the
chief
of
these
state
observances
is
the
sacrifice
at
the
winter
solstice
which
is
performed
before
sunrise
on
the
morning
of
the
of
december
at
the
temple
of
heaven
the
form
of
the
altar
is
peculiar
it
consists
of
a
triple
circular
terrace
wide
at
the
base
in
the
middle
and
at
the
top
the
emperor
with
his
immediate
suite
kneels
in
front
of
the
tablet
of
the
supreme
being
or
heaven
and
faces
the
north
the
platform
is
laid
with
marble
stones
forming
nine
concentric
circles
the
inner
circle
consists
of
nine
stones
cut
so
as
to
fit
with
close
edges
round
the
central
stone
which
is
a
perfect
circle
here
the
emperor
kneels
and
is
surrounded
first
by
the
circles
of
the
terraces
and
their
enclosing
walls
and
then
by
the
circle
of
the
horizon
he
then
seems
to
himself
and
to
his
court
to
be
in
the
centre
of
the
universe
and
turning
to
the
north
assuming
the
attitude
of
a
subject
he
acknowledges
in
prayer
and
by
his
position
that
he
is
inferior
to
heaven
and
to
heaven
alone
round
him
on
the
pavement
are
the
nine
circles
of
as
many
heavens
consisting
of
nine
stones
then
eighteen
then
and
so
on
in
successive
multiples
of
nine
till
the
square
of
nine
the
favourite
number
of
chinese
philosophy
is
reached
in
the
outermost
circle
of
stones
on
this
occasion
also
a
bullock
of
two
years
old
and
without
blemish
is
offered
as
a
whole
in
a
green
porcelain
furnace
which
stands
close
beside
the
altar
the
emperor
life
is
largely
occupied
with
ceremonial
observances
and
custom
ordains
that
except
on
state
occasions
he
should
not
leave
the
walls
of
the
palace
for
his
knowledge
of
public
affairs
the
emperor
is
thus
largely
dependent
upon
such
information
as
courtiers
and
high
officers
of
state
permit
to
reach
him
the
palace
eunuchs
have
often
exercised
great
power
though
their
influence
has
been
less
under
the
manchus
than
was
the
case
during
previous
dynasties
though
in
theory
the
throne
commands
the
services
and
money
of
all
its
subjects
yet
the
crown
as
such
has
no
revenues
peculiarly
its
own
it
is
dependent
on
contributions
levied
through
the
high
officials
on
the
several
provinces
subject
always
to
the
will
of
the
people
and
without
their
concurrence
and
nothing
can
be
done
the
power
of
the
purse
and
the
power
of
the
sword
are
thus
exercised
mediately
and
the
autocratic
power
is
in
practice
transferred
to
the
general
body
of
high
functionaries
or
to
that
clique
which
for
the
time
being
has
the
ear
of
the
emperor
and
is
united
enough
and
powerful
enough
to
impose
its
will
on
the
others
china
governed
by
its
civil
service
the
functionaries
who
thus
really
wield
the
supreme
power
are
almost
without
exception
civil
officials
naturally
the
court
has
shown
an
inclination
to
choose
manchu
rather
than
chinese
but
of
late
years
this
preference
has
become
less
marked
and
in
the
imperial
appointments
to
provincial
administrations
the
proportion
of
manchus
chosen
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
not
more
than
of
the
whole
number
the
real
reason
for
this
change
is
the
marked
superiority
of
the
chinese
in
whose
hands
the
administration
is
stated
to
be
safer
for
the
manchu
dynasty
practically
all
the
high
chinese
officials
have
risen
through
the
junior
ranks
of
the
civil
service
and
obtained
their
high
position
as
the
reward
so
it
must
be
presumed
of
long
and
distinguished
public
service
functions
of
the
central
government
through
the
weakness
of
some
of
the
emperors
the
functions
of
the
central
government
gradually
came
to
be
to
check
the
action
of
the
provincial
governments
rather
than
assume
a
direct
initiative
in
the
conduct
of
affairs
the
central
government
may
be
said
to
criticize
rather
than
to
control
the
action
of
the
provincial
administrations
wielding
however
at
all
times
the
power
of
immediate
removal
from
his
post
of
any
official
whose
conduct
may
be
found
irregular
or
considered
dangerous
to
the
stability
of
the
state
this
was
written
in
and
since
then
the
pressure
of
foreign
nations
has
compelled
the
central
government
to
assume
greater
responsibilities
and
the
empire
is
now
ruled
from
peking
in
a
much
more
effective
manner
than
was
the
case
when
lord
napier
in
could
find
no
representative
of
the
central
government
with
whom
to
transact
business
if
the
central
authorities
take
the
initiative
and
issue
orders
to
the
provincial
authorities
it
however
does
not
follow
that
they
will
be
carried
out
the
orders
if
unwelcome
are
not
directly
disobeyed
but
rather
ignored
or
specious
pleas
are
put
forward
showing
the
difficulty
or
impossibility
of
carrying
them
out
at
that
particular
juncture
the
central
government
always
wields
the
power
of
removing
or
degrading
a
recalcitrant
governor
and
no
case
has
been
known
where
such
an
order
was
not
promptly
obeyed
but
the
central
government
being
composed
of
officials
stand
by
their
order
and
are
extremely
reluctant
to
issue
such
a
command
especially
at
the
bidding
of
a
foreign
power
generally
the
opinion
of
the
governors
and
viceroys
has
great
weight
with
the
central
government
departments
of
the
central
administration
under
the
ming
dynasty
the
or
grand
secretariat
formed
the
supreme
council
of
the
empire
it
is
now
of
more
honorific
than
actual
importance
active
membership
is
limited
to
six
persons
namely
four
grand
secretaries
and
two
assistant
grand
secretaries
half
of
whom
according
to
a
general
rule
formerly
applicable
to
nearly
all
the
high
offices
in
peking
must
be
manchu
and
half
chinese
it
constitutes
the
imperial
chancery
or
court
of
archives
and
admission
to
its
ranks
confers
the
highest
distinction
attainable
by
chinese
officials
though
with
functions
that
are
almost
purely
nominal
members
of
the
grand
secretariat
are
distinguished
by
the
honorary
title
of
the
most
distinguished
viceroys
are
usually
advanced
to
the
dignity
of
grand
secretary
while
continuing
to
occupy
their
posts
in
the
provinces
the
best
known
of
recent
grand
secretaries
was
li
under
the
manchu
dynasty
the
grand
council
chi
became
the
actual
privy
council
of
the
sovereign
in
whose
presence
its
members
daily
transacted
the
business
of
the
state
this
council
is
composed
of
a
small
knot
of
men
holding
various
high
offices
in
the
government
boards
at
peking
the
literal
meaning
of
chün
chi
is
place
of
plans
for
the
army
and
the
institution
derives
its
name
from
the
practice
established
by
the
early
emperors
of
the
manchu
dynasty
of
treating
public
affairs
on
the
footing
of
a
military
council
the
usual
time
of
transacting
business
is
from
to
in
addition
to
the
grand
council
and
the
grand
secretariat
there
were
boards
to
supervise
particular
departments
by
a
decree
of
the
of
november
the
central
administration
was
remodelled
subsequent
decrees
making
other
changes
the
administration
in
was
carried
on
by
the
following
agencies
a
the
grand
council
its
title
was
modified
in
and
it
is
now
known
as
the
grand
council
of
state
affairs
or
privy
council
it
has
no
special
function
but
deals
with
all
matters
of
general
administration
and
is
presided
over
by
the
emperor
or
regent
the
grand
secretariat
this
body
gained
no
increase
of
power
in
the
advisory
council
or
senate

created

containing
representatives
of

it

and
the
heads
of
all
the

departments
the

three
bodies

besides
boards
concerned
with
the
affairs
of
the
court
there
were
before
the
pressure
of
foreign
nations
and
the
movement
for
reform
caused
changes
to
be
made
six
boards
charged
with
the
conduct
of
public
affairs
they
were
the
board
of
civil
appointments
controlling
all
appointments
in
the
civil
service
from
the
rank
of
district
magistrate
upwards
the
board
of
revenue
dealing
with
all
revenues
which
reached
the
central
government
the
board
of
ceremonies
the
board
of
war
it
controlled
the
provincial
forces
the
manchu
forces
were
an
independent
organization
attached
to
the
palace
the
board
of
punishments
it
dealt
with
the
criminal
law
only
especially
the
punishment
of
officials
guilty
of
malpractices
the
board
of
works
its
work
was
limited
to
the
control
of
the
construction
and
repair
of
official
residences
as
rearranged
and
enlarged
there
are
now
the
following
boards
given
in
order
of
precedence
this
was
established
in
in
succession
to
the
which
was
created
in
after
the
war
in
as
a
board
for
foreign
affairs
previous
to
that
war
which
established
the
right
of
foreign
powers
to
have
their
representatives
in
peking
all
business
with
western
nations
was
transacted
by
provincial
authorities
chiefly
the
viceroy
at
canton
the
only
department
at
peking
which
dealt
specially
with
foreign
affairs
was
the
fan
or
board
of
control
for
the
dependencies
which
regulated
the
affairs
of
mongolia
tibet
and
the
tributary
states
generally
with
the
advent
of
formally
accredited
ambassadors
from
the
european
powers
something
more
than
this
was
required
and
a
special
board
was
appointed
to
discuss
all
questions
with
the
foreign
envoys
the
number
was
originally
four
with
prince
kung
a
brother
of
the
emperor
hien
fêng
at
their
head
it
was
subsequently
raised
to
ten
another
prince
of
the
blood
prince
ching
becoming
president
the
members
were
spoken
of
collectively
as
the
prince
and
ministers
for
a
long
time
the
board
had
no
real
power
and
was
looked
on
rather
as
a
buffer
between
the
foreign
envoys
and
the
real
government
the
importance
of
foreign
affairs
however
especially
since
the
japanese
war
identified
the
more
with
the
grand
council
several
of
the
most
prominent
men
being
members
of
both
at
the
same
time
that
the
was
created
two
important
offices
were
established
in
the
provinces
for
dealing
with
foreign
commercial
questions
viz
the
superintendencies
of
trade
for
the
northern
and
southern
ports
the
negotiations
connected
with
the
boxer
outbreak
proved
so
conclusively
that
the
machinery
to
the
was
of
too
antiquated
a
nature
to
serve
the
new
requirements
that
it
was
determined
to
abolish
the
and
to
substitute
for
it
a
board
to
be
styled

malfeasance
of
his
officers
these
men
are
termed
imperial
recorder
generally
translated
censors
their
office
has
existed
since
the
century
the
body
consists
of
two
presidents
a
chinese
and
a
manchu

censors
attached
to
the
ministries
at

censors

fifteen
divisions

division
taking
a
particular
province

area
so
as
to
embrace

all

china
the
ranks
of
the
civil
service
are
recruited
by
means
of
examinations
up
to
the
beginning
of
the
subjects
in
which
candidates
were
examined
were
purely
chinese
and
literary
with
a
smattering
of
history
in
this
system
was
modified
and
an
official
career
was
opened
to
candidates
who
had
obtained
honours
in
an
examination
in
western
subjects
see
the
old
system
is
so
closely
identified
with
the
life
of
china
that
some
space
must
be
devoted
to
a
description
of
it
as
a
general
rule
students
preparing
for
the
public
examination
read
with
private
tutors
there
were
neither
high
schools
nor
universities
where
a
regular
training
could
be
got
in
most
of
the
provincial
capitals
and
at
some
other
places
there
were
indeed
institutions
termed
colleges
supported
to
some
extent
from
public
funds
where
advanced
students
could
prosecute
their
studies
but
before
the
movement
initiated
by
the
viceroy
chang
after
the
war
of
they
hardly
counted
as
factors
in
the
national
education
the
private
tutors
on
the
other
hand
were
plentiful
and
cheap
after
a
series
of
preliminary
trials
the
student
obtained
his
first
qualification
by
examination
held
before
the
literary
chancellor
in
the
prefecture
to
which
he
belonged
this
was
termed
the
or
licentiate
degree
and
was
merely
a
qualification
to
enter
for
the
higher
examinations
the
number
of
licentiate
degrees
to
be
given
was
however
strictly
limited
those
who
failed
to
get
in
were
set
back
to
try
again
which
they
might
do
as
often
as
they
pleased
there
was
no
limit
of
age
those
selected
next
proceeded
to
the
great
examination
held
at
the
capital
of
each
province
once
in
three
years
before
examiners
sent
from
peking
for
the
purpose
here
again
the
number
who
passed
was
strictly
limited
out
of
or
competitors
only
some
or
could
obtain
degrees
the
others
as
before
must
go
back
and
try
again
this
degree
termed
or
provincial
graduate
was
the
first
substantial
reward
of
the
student
ambition
and
of
itself
qualified
for
the
public
service
though
it
did
not
immediately
nor
necessarily
lead
to
active
employment
the
third
and
final
examination
took
place
at
peking
and
was
open
to
provincial
graduates
from
all
parts
of
the
empire
out
of
competitors
entering
for
this
final
test
which
was
held
triennially
some
to
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
degree
of
or
metropolitan
graduate
these
were
the
finally
selected
men
who
became
the
officials
of
the
empire
several
other
doors
were
however
open
by
which
admission
to
the
ranks
of
bureaucracy
could
be
obtained
in
the
first
place
to
encourage
scholars
to
persevere
a
certain
number
of
those
who
failed
to
reach
the
or
second
degree
were
allowed
as
a
reward
of
repeated
efforts
to
get
into
a
special
class
from
which
selection
for
office
might
be
made
further
the
government
reserved
to
itself
the
right
to
nominate
the
sons
and
grandsons
of
distinguished
deceased
public
servants
without
examination
and
lastly
by
a
system
of
recommendation
young
men
from
favoured
institutions
or
men
who
had
served
as
clerks
in
the
boards
might
be
put
on
the
roster
for
substantive
appointment
the
necessities
of
the
chinese
government
also
from
time
to
time
compelled
it
to
throw
open
a
still
wider
door
of
entry
into
the
civil
service
namely
admission
by
purchase
during
the
rebellion
when
the
government
was
at
its
wits
end
for
money
formal
sanction
was
given
to
what
had
previously
been
only
intermittently
resorted
to
and
since
then
immense
sums
of
money
have
been
received
by
the
sale
of
patents
of
rank
to
secure
either
admission
to
office
or
more
rapid
promotion
of
those
already
employed
as
a
result
of
this
policy
the
country
has
been
saddled
with
thousands
of
titular
officials
far
in
excess
of
the
number
of
appointments
to
be
given
away
deserving
men
were
kept
waiting
for
years
while
inferior
and
less
capable
officials
were
pushed
ahead
because
they
had
money
wherewith
to
bribe
their
way
nevertheless
the
purchase
system
admitted
into
the
service
a
number
of
men
free
from
that
bigoted
adherence
to
confucian
doctrine
which
characterizes
the
literary
classes
and
more
in
touch
with
modern
progress
all
candidates
who
succeed
in
entering
the
official
ranks
are
eligible
for
active
employment
but
as
the
number
of
candidates
is
far
in
excess
of
the
number
of
appointments
a
period
of
weary
waiting
ensues
a
few
of
the
best
scholars
get
admitted
at
once
into
the
hanlin
college
or
into
one
or
other
of
the
boards
at
peking
the
rest
are
drafted
off
in
batches
to
the
various
provinces
to
await
their
turn
for
appointment
as
vacancies
occur
during
this
period
of
waiting
they
are
termed
expectants
and
draw
no
regular
pay
occasional
service
however
falls
in
their
way
as
when
they
are
commissioned
for
special
duty
in
outlying
districts
which
they
perform
as
or
deputies
of
the
regular
officials
the
period
of
expectancy
may
be
abridged
by
recommendation
or
purchase
and
it
is
generally
supposed
that
this
last
lever
must
invariably
be
resorted
to
to
secure
any
lucrative
local
appointment
a
poor
but
promising
official
is
often
it
is
said
financed
by
a
syndicate
of
relations
and
friends
who
look
to
recoup
themselves
out
of
the
customary
perquisites
which
attach
to
the
post
appointments
to
the
junior
provincial
posts
are
usually
left
to
the
provincial
government
but
the
central
government
can
always
interfere
directly
appointments
to
the
lucrative
posts
of
customs
at
the
treaty
ports
are
usually
made
direct
from
peking
and
the
officer
selected
is
neither
necessarily
nor
usually
from
the
provincial
staff
it
would
perhaps
be
safe
to
say
that
this
appointment
has
hitherto
always
been
the
result
of
a
pecuniary
arrangement
of
greater
or
less
magnitude
bribery
and
torture
during
the
first
five
years
of
the
new
method
by
which
candidates
for
the
civil
service
were
required
in
addition
to
chinese
classics
to
have
a
knowledge
of
western
science
great
efforts
were
made
in
several
provinces
to
train
up
a
better
class
of
public
official
the
old
system
of
administration
had
many
theoretical
excellencies
and
there
had
been
notable
instances
of
upright
administration
but
the
regulation
which
forbade
a
mandarin
to
hold
any
office
for
more
than
three
years
made
it
the
selfish
interest
of
every
to
get
as
much
out
of
the
people
within
his
jurisdiction
as
he
possibly
could
in
that
time
this
corruption
in
high
places
had
a
thoroughly
demoralizing
effect
while
among
the
better
commercial
classes
chinese
probity
in
business
relations
with
foreigners
is
proverbial
the
people
generally
set
little
or
no
value
upon
truth
and
this
has
led
to
the
use
of
torture
in
their
courts
of
justice
for
it
is
argued
that
where
the
value
of
an
oath
is
not
understood
some
other
means
must
be
resorted
to
to
extract
evidence
the
or
district
magistrate
decides
ordinary
police
cases
he
is
also
coroner
and
sheriff
he
hears
suits
for
divorce
and
breach
of
promise
and
is
a
court
of
first
instance
in
all
civil
cases
the
penalty
for
taking
a
case
first
to
a
higher
court
is
fifty
blows
with
the
bamboo
on
the
naked
thigh
appeal
from
the
court
lies
to
the
or
prefectural
court
and
thence
cases
may
be
taken
to
the
provincial
judge
who
signs
death
warrants
while
there
are
final
courts
of
appeal
at
peking
civil
cases
are
usually
settled
by
trade
gilds
in
towns
and
by
village
elders
or
by
arbitration
in
rural
districts
reference
has
been
made
to
the
use
of
torture
flogging
is
the
only
form
of
torture
which
has
been
allowed
under
the
manchus
the
obdurate
witness
is
laid
on
his
face
and
the
executioner
delivers
his
blows
on
the
upper
part
of
the
thighs
with
the
concave
side
of
a
split
bamboo
the
sharp
edges
of
which
mutilate
the
sufferer
terribly
the
punishment
is
continued
until
the
man
either
supplies
the
evidence
required
or
becomes
insensible
punishment
by
bamboo
was
formally
abolished
by
imperial
edict
in
and
other
judicial
reforms
were
instituted
they
remained
largely
inoperative
and
even
in
shanghai
under
the
eyes
of
foreign
residents
gross
cases
of
the
infliction
of
torture
occurred
in
for
capital
offences
the
usual
modes
of
inflicting
the
extreme
penalty
of
the
law
are
in
bad
cases
such
as
parricides
cutting
to
pieces
and
for
less
aggravated
crimes
either
strangulation
or
decapitation
the
culprit
who
is
condemned
to
be
cut
to
pieces
is
fastened
to
a
cross
and
while
thus
suspended
cuts
are
made
by
the
executioner
on
the
fleshy
parts
of
the
body
and
he
is
then
beheaded
strangulation
is
reserved
for
lesser
degrees
of
guilt
it
being
considered
a
privilege
to
pass
out
of
life
with
a
whole
body
when
it
has
been
granted
to
a
criminal
of
rank
thus
to
meet
his
end
a
silken
cord
is
sent
to
him
at
his
own
home
no
explanatory
message
is
considered
necessary
and
he
is
left
to
consummate
his
own
doom
popular
sentiment
regards
decapitation
as
a
peculiarly
disgraceful
mode
of
death
constant
practice
makes
the
executioners
wonderfully
expert
in
the
performance
of
their
office
no
block
or
for

of

the
manchu
garrisons
both
in
the
capital
and
in
the
provinces
had
long
become
quite
effete
in
the
capital

the
of

formed

were
other
corps

better
paid
and
better
armed
than
the
ordinary
soldier

it
was
computed
that
in
the
manchu
army
in

near
peking
could
muster
all

was

the
actual
strength
was
about
of
this
they
were
enrolled
to
keep
the
peace
within

own
province
and
resembled
a
militia
or
local
constabulary
rather
than
a
national
army
they
were
generally
poorly

and
equally
badly
drilled
and
armed
the
only
real
fighting
force
which
china
possessed
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
was
made
up
of
certain
special
corps
which
were
not
provided
for
in
the
constitution
and
consequently
used
to
be
termed
braves
or
irregulars
but
had
acquired
various
distinctive
names
they
were
enlisted
by
provincial
governors
and
all
had
some
smattering
of
foreign
drill
they
were
also
fairly
well
paid
and
armed
after
the
war
of
some
of
these
corps
were
quartered
near
peking
and
tientsin

came
generally
to
be
spoken
of

an
imperial
decree
issued
in

the
reorganization
of

on

lines
something
was
accomplished
especially
in
under

practically
created
the

it
was
not
however
until
after
the
war
that
determined
efforts
were
made
to
organize
a
national

army

the

after

china
possessed
no

which
could
dock

many
years
ago
the
chinese
government
established
at

a
shipbuilding

placing
it
in
the
hands
of
french
engineers
training
schools
both
for

at
the

time
organized
and
a
training
ship
was
procured
and
put
under
the
command
of
a
british
naval
officer
some
or
thirty
small
vessels
were
built
in
the
course
of
as
many
years
but
gradually
the
whole
organization
was
allowed
to
fall
into
decay
except
for
petty
repairs
this
establishment
was
in
valueless
to
the
chinese
government
there
were
also
small
dockyards
at
near
shanghai
whampoa
and
taku
there
are
arsenals
at
shanghai
and
at
tientsin
but
as
they
are
both
placed
up
shallow
rivers
they
are
useless
for
naval
repairs
both
are
capable
of
turning
out
heavy
guns
and
also
rifles
and
ammunition
in
large
quantities
there
are
also
military

a
great
number
of
forts
and
batteries
have
been
erected
along

at

entrance
to
the
principal

chief
among
these
now
that
the

the
chinese
empire
is
an
agglomeration
of
a
number
of
units
each
province
has
a
complete
administrative
staff
collects
its
own
revenue
pays
its
own
civil
service
and
other
charges
placed
upon
it
and
out
of
the
surplus
contributes
towards
the
expenses
of
the
imperial
government
a
sum
which
varies
with
the
imperiousness
of
the
needs
of
the
latter
and
with
its
own
comparative
wealth
or
poverty
the
imperial
government
does
not
collect
directly
any
part
of
the
revenues
unless
the
imperial
maritime
customs
be
excepted
though
these
too
pass
through
the
books
of
the
provincial
authorities
it
has
hitherto
been
extremely
difficult
to
obtain
anything
like
trustworthy
figures
for
the
whole
revenue
of
china
for
the
reason
that
no
complete
statistics
are
published
by
the
central
government
at
peking
the
only
available
data
are
first
the
returns
published
by
the
imperial
maritime
customs
for
the
duties
levied
on
foreign
trade
and
secondly
the
memorials
sent
to
peking
by
the
provincial
authorities
on
revenue
matters
certain
of
which
are
published
from
time
to
time
in
the
these
are
usually
fragmentary
being
merely
reports
which
the
governor
has
received
from
his
subordinates
detailing
as
the
case
may
be
the
yield
of
the
land
tax
or
the
likin
for
his
particular
district
with
a
dissertation
on
the
causes
which
have
made
it
more
or
less
than
for
the
previous
period
or
the
return
may
be
one
detailing
the
expenditure
of
such
and
such
a
department
or
reporting
the
transmission
of
a
sum
in
reply
to
a
requisition
of
the
board
of
revenue
with
a
statement
of
the
source
from
which
it
has
been
met
it
is
only
by
collating
these
returns
over
a
long
period
that
anything
like
a
complete
statement
can
be
made
up
and
even
then
these
returns
do
not
represent
anything
like
the
total
of
taxation
paid
by
the
people
but
as
far
as
they
go
they
may
be
taken
to
represent
the
volume
of
taxation
on
which
the
peking
government
can
draw
revenue
the
following
table
taken
from
a
memorandum
by

an

insufficient

on
which
to
maintain
the
fabric
of
government
in
an
empire
like
china
but
it
has
been
reached
by
calculations
based
on
a
few
known
facts
and
is
offered
as
throwing
some
light
on
a
subject
veiled
in
obscurity
the
service
of
the
foreign
debt
together
with
the
pressure
of
other
needs
such
as
the
cost
of
education
and
the
army
made
more
manifest
than
previously
the
chaos
of
the
chinese
fiscal
system
a
scheme
to
reform
the
national
finances
was
promulgated
under
an
edict
of
the
of
january
but
it
did
not
appear
to
be
of
a
practical
character
of
i
in
china
as
in
most
oriental
countries
the
land
has
from
time
immemorial
been
the
mainstay
of
the
revenue
in
the
early
years
of
the
present
dynasty
there
was
levied
along
with
the
land
tax
a
poll
tax
on
all
adult
males
but
in
the
two
were
amalgamated
and
the
whole
burden
was
thrown
upon
land
families
not
possessing
land
being
thereafter
exempted
from
taxation
at
the
same
time
it
was
decreed
that
the
amount
of
the
land
tax
as
then
fixed
should
be
permanent
and
settled
for
all
time
coming
it
would
appear
from
the
records
that
this
promise
has
been
kept
as
far
as
the
central
government
has
been
concerned
in
all
its
many
financial
difficulties
it
does
not
seem
ever
to
have
tried
to
increase
the
revenue
by
raising
the
land
tax
the
amount
of
tax
leviable
on
each
plot
is
entered
on
the
title
deed
and
once
entered
it
can
not
be
changed
the
tax
on
almost
all
lands
is
thus
stated
to
be
so
much
in
silver
and
so
much
in
rice
wheat
or
whatever
the
principal
crop
may
be
except
in
two
provinces
however
the
grain
tax
is
now
commuted
and
paid
in
silver
the
exceptions
are
and
which
still
send
forward
their
taxes
in
grain
the
value
of
the
grain
forwarded
generally
called
tribute
rice
is
estimated
at
taels
the
total
collection
in
silver
as
reported
by
the
responsible
officials
amounts
in
round
numbers
to
taels
the
total
yield
of
the
land
tax
therefore
is
taels
or
say
it
will
readily
be
granted
that
for
such
a
large
country
as
china
this
is
a
very
insignificant
one
in
india
the
land
tax
yields
about
and
china
has
undoubtedly
a
larger
cultivated
area
a
larger
population
and
soil
that
is
on
the
whole
more
fertile
but
it
is
certain
that
this
sum
by
no
means
represents
the
amounts
actually
paid
by
the
cultivators
it
is
the
sum
which
the
various
magistrates
and
collectors
have
to
account
for
and
remit
in
hard
cash
but
as
nothing
is
allowed
them
for
the
costs
of
collection
they
add
on
a
percentage
beforehand
to
cover
the
cost
this
they
usually
do
by
declaring
the
taxes
leviable
not
in
silver
but
in
copper
cash
which
indeed
is
the
only
currency
that
circulates
in
country
places
and
by
fixing
the
rate
of
exchange
to
suit
themselves
thus
while
the
market
rate
is
say
cash
to
the
tael
they
declare
by
general
proclamation
that
for
purposes
cash
will
be
received
at
the
rate
of
or
to
the
tael
thus
while
the
nominal
land
tax
in
silver
remains
the
same
it
is
in
effect
doubled
or
trebled
and
what
is
worse
no
return
is
made
or
account
required
of
the
extra
sums
thus
levied
each
magistrate
or
collector
is
in
effect
a
farmer
the
sum
standing
opposite
the
name
of
his
district
is
the
sum
which
he
is
bound
to
return
under
penalty
of
dismissal
but
all
sums
which
he
can
scrape
together
over
and
above
are
the
perquisites
of
office
less
his
necessary
expenses
custom
no
doubt
sets
bounds
to
his
rapacity
if
he
went
too
far
he
would
provoke
a
riot
but
one
may
safely
say
there
never
is
any
reduction
what
change
can
be
effected
being
in
the
upward
direction
according
to
the
best
information
obtainable
a
moderate
estimate
of
the
sums
actually
paid
by
the
cultivators
would
give
two
shillings
per
acre
this
on
an
estimate
of
the
area
under
cultivation
should
give
for
the
eighteen
provinces
as
being
actually
levied
or
more
than
four
times
what
is
returned
salt
the
trade
in
salt
is
a
government
monopoly
only
licensed
merchants
are
allowed
to
deal
in
it
and
the
import
of
foreign
salt
is
forbidden
by
the
treaties
for
the
purpose
of
salt
administration
china
is
divided
into
seven
or
eight
main
circuits
each
of
which
has
its
own
sources
of
production
each
circuit
has
carefully
defined
boundaries
and
salt
produced
in
one
circuit
is
not
allowed
to
be
consigned
into
or
sold
in
another
there
are
great
differences
in
price
between
the
several
circuits
but
the
consumer
is
not
allowed
to
buy
in
the
cheapest
market
he
can
only
buy
from
the
licensed
merchants
in
his
own
circuit
who
in
turn
are
debarred
from
procuring
supplies
except
at
the
depot
to
which
they
belong
conveyance
from
one
circuit
to
another
is
deemed
smuggling
and
subjects
the
article
to
confiscation
duty
is
levied
under
two
heads
the
first
being
a
duty
proper
payable
on
the
issue
of
salt
from
the
depot
and
the
second
being
likin
levied
on
transit
or
at
the
place
of
destination
the
two
together
amount
on
an
average
to
about
taels
per
picul
of
lb
or
per
cwt
the
total
collection
returned
by
the
various
salt
collectorates
amounts
to
taels
per
annum
the
total
consumption
of
salt
for
all
china
is
estimated
at
million
piculs
or
nearly
million
tons
which
is
at
the
rate
of
lb
per
annum
per
head
of
the
population
if
the
above
amount
of
taels
were
uniformly
levied
and
returned
the
revenue
would
be
million
taels
instead
of
in
this
calculation
however
no
allowance
is
made
for
the
cost
of
collection
on
general
by
the
term
likin
is
meant
a
tax
on
inland
trade
levied
while
in
transit
from
one
district
to
another
it
was
originally
a
war
tax
imposed
as
a
temporary
measure
to
meet
the
military
expenditure
required
by
the
and
mahommedan
rebellions
of
it
is
now
one
of
the
permanent
sources
of
income
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
in
form
as
objectionable
as
a
tax
can
be
and
is
equally
obnoxious
to
the
native
and
to
the
foreign
merchant
tolls
or
barriers
are
erected
at
frequent
intervals
along
all
the
principal
routes
of
trade
whether
by
land
or
water
and
a
small
levy
is
made
at
each
on
every
conceivable
article
of
commerce
the
individual
levy
is
small
but
over
a
long
transit
it
may
amount
to
or
the
objectionable
feature
is
the
frequent
stoppages
with
overhauling
of
cargo
and
consequent
delays
by
treaty
foreign
goods
may
commute
all
transit
dues
for
a
single
payment
of
the
import
tariff
duty
but
this
stipulation
is
but
indifferently
observed
it
must
also
be
remembered
per
contra
that
dishonest
foreign
merchants
will
take
out
passes
to
cover
goods
the
difficulty
in
securing
due
observance
of
treaty
rights
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
likin
revenue
is
claimed
by
the
provincial
authorities
and
the
transit
dues
when
commuted
belong
to
the
central
government
so
that
the
former
are
interested
in
opposing
the
commutation
by
every
means
in
their
power
as
a
further
means
of
neutralizing
the
commutation
they
have
devised
a
new
form
of
impost
viz
a
terminal
tax
which
is
levied
on
the
goods
after
the
termination
of
the
transit
the
amount
and
frequency
of
likin
taxation
are
fixed
by
provincial
legislation
that
is
by
a
proclamation
of
the
governor
the
levy
is
authorized
in
general
terms
by
an
imperial
decree
but
all
details
are
left
to
the
local
authorities
the
yield
of
this
tax
is
estimated
at
taels
a
sum
which
probably
represents
of
what
is
actually
paid
by
the
merchants
the
balance
being
costs
of
collection
maritime
the
maritime
customs
is
the
one
department
of
finance
in
china
which
is
managed
with
probity
and
honesty
and
this
it
owes
to
the
fact
that
it
is
worked
under
foreign
control
it
collects
all
the
duties
leviable
under
the
treaties
on
the
foreign
trade
of
china
and
also
all
duties
on
the
coasting
trade
so
far
as
carried
on
by

of

or
foreign
owned

not

the

of
the
maritime
customs
rose
from
taels
in
to
taels
in
the
administration
of
the
native
customs
continues
to
be
similar
to
what
prevailed
in
the
maritime
customs
before
the
introduction
of
foreign
supervision
each
collector
is
constituted
a
farmer
bound
to
account
for
a
fixed
minimum
sum
but
practically
at
liberty
to
retain
all
he
may
collect
over
and
above
if
he
returns
more
he
may
claim
certain
honorary
rewards
as
for
extra
diligence
but
he
generally
manages
to
make
out
his
accounts
so
as
to
show
a
small
surplus
and
no
more
only
imperfect
and
fragmentary
returns
of
the
native
collectorates
have
been
published
but
the
total
revenue
accruing
to
the
chinese
government
from
this
source
did
not
appear
up
to
much
to
exceed
two
million
taels
in
november
native
customs
offices
within
of
a
treaty
port
were
placed
under
the
control
of
the
maritime
customs
their
revenues
having
been
hypothecated
for
the
service
of
the
boxer
indemnity
the
result
was
that
the
amount
of
the
native
customs
collected
by
the
commissioners
of
customs
increased
from
taels
in
to
taels
in
on

the
collection
of
the

in

they
are

to
rendera

to

was
a
similar
rate
to
that
levied
on
indian
opium
it
should
give
a
revenue
of
million
taels
compared
with
this
the
sums
actually
levied
or
at
least
returned
by
the
local
officials
as
levied
were
insignificant
the
returns
gave
a
total
levy
for
all
the
eighteen
provinces
of
only
taels
the
smoking
campaign
initiated
by
the
chinese
government
in
affected
the
revenue
both
by
the
decreased
importation
of
the
drug
and
the
decrease
in
the
area
under
poppy
cultivation
in
china
in
the
opium
likin
revenue
had
fallen
to
taels
besides
the
main
and
regular
sources
of
income
the
provincial
officials
levy
sums
which
must
in
the
aggregate
amount
to
a
very
large
figure
but
which
hardly
find
a
place
in
the
returns
the
principal
are
land
transfer
fees
pawnbrokers
and
other
licences
duties
on
reed
flats
commutation
of
corvée
and
personal
services
the
fee
on
land
transfers
is
and
it
could
be
shown
from
a
calculation
based
on
the
extent
and
value
of
the
arable
land
and
the
probable
number
of
sales
that
this
item
alone
ought
to
yield
an
annual
return
of
between
one
and
two
millions
sterling
practically
the
whole
of
this
is
absorbed
in
office
expenses
under
this
heading
should
also
be
included
certain
items
which
though
not
deemed
part
of
the
regular
revenue
have
been
so
often
resorted
to
that
they
can
not
be
left
out
of
account
these
are
the
sums
derived
from
sale
of
office
or
of
brevet
rank
and
the
subscriptions
and
benevolences
which
under
one
plea
or
another
the
government
succeeds
in
levying
from
the
wealthy
excluding
these
the
government
is
always
ready
to
receive
subscriptions
rewarding
the
donor
with
a
grant
of
official
rank
entitling
him
to
wear
the
appropriate
button
the
right
is
much
sought
after
and
indeed
there
are
very
few
chinamen
of
any
standing
that
are
not
thus
decorated
for
not
only
does
the
button
confer
social
standing
but
it
gives
the
wearer
certain
very
substantial
advantages
in
case
he
should
come
into
contact
with
the
law
courts
the
minimum
price
for
the
lowest
grade
is
taels
and
more
of
course
for
higher
grades
the
proceeds
of
these
sales
go
directly
to
the
peking
government
and
do
not
as
a
rule
figure
in
the
provincial
returns
the
total
of
the
miscellaneous
items
accruing
for
the
benefit
of
the
government
is
estimated
at
taels
in
regard
to
expenditure
a
distinction
has
to
be
drawn
between
that
portion
of
the
revenue
which
is
controlled
by
the
central
government
and
that
controlled
by
the
several
provincial
authorities
as
the
provinces
collect
the
revenue
and
as
the
authorities
there
are
held
responsible
for
the
peace
order
and
good
government
of
their
respective
territories
it
follows
that
the
necessary
expenses
of
the
provinces
form
a
sort
of
first
charge
on
the
revenue
as
the
tables
given
show
the
provinces
spend
the
greater
part
of
the
revenue
collected
the
board
of
revenue
at
peking
which
is
charged
with
a
general
supervision
of
finance
matters
all
over
the
empire
makes
up
at
the
end
of
the
year
a
general
estimate
of
the
funds
that
will
be
required
for
imperial
purposes
during
the
ensuing
year
and
apportions
the
amount
among
the
several
provinces
and
the
several
collectorates
in
each
province
the
estimate
is
submitted
to
the
emperor
and
when
sanctioned
instructions
are
sent
to
all
the
viceroys
and
governors
in
that
sense
who
in
turn
pass
them
on
to
their
subordinate
officers
in
ordinary
times
these
demands
do
not
materially
vary
from
year
to
year
and
long
practice
has
created
a
sort
of
equilibrium
between
imperial
and
provincial
demands
the
remittances
to
the
capital
are
as
a
rule
forwarded
with
reasonable
regularity
mostly
in
the
form
of
hard
cash
there
is
however
a
constant
pull
going
on
between
peking
and
the
provinces
the
former
always
asking
for
more
the
latter
resisting
and
pleading
impecuniosity
yet
generally
able
to
find
the
amounts
required
the
expenses
which
the
central
government
has
to
meet
are
imperial
household
pay
of
the
manchu
garrison
in
and
about
peking
costs
of
the
civil
administration
in

far
as

are
not
borne
by
the

to
meet
all
these
charges
the
peking
government
for
several
years
up
to

on
the
provinces
for
about
taels
including
the
value
of
the

which
goes
to
the
support
of
the
manchu
bannermen
no
estimates
are
furnished
of
the
sums
allowed
under
such
heading
the
imperial
household
appears
to
receive
in

about
taels

it
draws
besides
large
supplies
in

from
the
provinces

this
decree
properly
enforced
would
introduce
a
much
needed
stability
into
the
monetary
system
of
china
the
actual
currency
consists
of
l
which
may
be
either
uncoined
ingots
passing
current
by
weight
or
imported
coins
mexican
dollars
and
british
dollars
and

which
has
no
fixed
relation
to
silver
the
standard
is
silver
the
unit
being
the
chinese
ounce
or
tael
containing
grains
the
tael
is
not
a
coin
but
a
weight
its
value
in
sterling
consequently
fluctuates
with
the
value
of

when
foreign
silver
is
imported
say
into
shanghai
it
can
be
converted
into
currency
by
a
very
simple
process
the
bars
of
silver
are
sent
to
a
office
termed
the
kung
or
public
valuers
and
by
them
melted
down
and
cast
into
ingots
of
the
customary
size
the
fineness
is
estimated
and
the
premium
or
betterness
together
with
the
exact
weight
is
marked
in
ink
on
each
ingot
the
whole
process
only
occupies
a
few
hours
and
the
silver
is
then
ready
to
be
put
into
use
the
kung
is
simply
a
local
office
appointed
by
the
bankers
of
the
place
and
the
weight
and
fineness
are
only
good
for
that
locality
the
government
takes
no
responsibility
in
the
matter
but
leaves
merchants
and
bankers
to
adjust
the
currency
as
they
please

purposes
of

and

there
is

is
about

in

parts
of
the
interior
chiefly
the
districts
being
preferred
by
the
people
and
as
the
supply
can
not
be
added
to
they
have
reached
a
considerable
premium
above
their
intrinsic

provincial
mints
in
canton
wuchang
and
other
places
have
issued
silver
coins
of
the
same
weight
and
touch
as
the
mexican
dollar
but
very
few
have
gone
into
use
as
they
possess
no
privilege
in
power
over
imported
mexican
dollars
there
is
no
inducement
for
the
people
to
take
them
up
unless
they
can
be
had
at
a
cheaper
rate
than
the
latter

these
are
laid
down
at
so
small
a
cost
above
the
intrinsic
value
that
no
profit
is
left
to
the
mint
the
coinage
has
in
consequence
been
almost
discontinued
subsidiary

however

largely
into
use

issued
by
the
local
mints
one
coin
the
hundredth
part
of
a
dollar
proved
very
popular
the

to
the
end
of
being
computed
at
but
at
rates
corresponding
closely
to
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
metal
in
it
the
only
coin
officially
issued
by
the
government
up
to

the
copper
it

a
small
coin

by
regulation
should
weigh
of
a
tael
and
should
contain
parts
of
copper
of
zinc
and
of
lead
or
tin
and
it
should
bear
a
fixed
ratio
to
silver
of
cash
to
one
tael
of
silver
in
practice
none
of
these
conditions
was
observed
being
issued
from
a
number
of
mints
mostly
provincial
the
standard
was
never
uniform
and
in
many
cases
debased
excessive
issues
lowered
the
value
of
the
coins
and
for
many
years
the
average
exchange
was
or
more
per
tael
the
rise
in
copper
led
to
the
melting
down
of
all
the
older
and
superior
coins
and
as
for
the
same
reason
coining
was
suspended
the
result
was
an
appreciation
of
the
cash
so
that
a
tael
in
exchanged
for
about
cash
or
about
to
a
penny
english
inasmuch
as
the
cash
bore
no
fixed
relation
to
silver
and
was
moreover
of
no
uniform
composition
it
formed
a
sort
of
mongrel
standard
of
its
own
varying

history
a
knowledge
of
china
up
to
as
known
to
the
the
spacious
seat
of
ancient
civilization
which
we
call
china
has
been
distinguished
by
different
appellations
according
as
it
was
reached
by
the
southern
or
by
the
northern
traversing
the
longitude
of
asia
in
the
former
aspect
the
name
has
nearly
always
been
some
form
of
the
name
chin
sinoe
in
the
latter
point
of
view
the
region
in
question
was
known
to
the
ancients
as
the
land
of
the

the
middle
ages
as
the
empire
of
the

been
supposed
doubtfully
to
be
derived
from
the
dynasty
of
which
a
little
more
than
two
centuries
before
the
christian
era
enjoyed
a
vigorous
existence
uniting
all
the
chinese
provinces
under
its
authority
and
extending
its
conquests
far
beyond
those
limits
to
the
south
and
the
west
the
mention
of
the
in
ancient
sanskrit
literature
both
in
the
laws
of
manu
and
in
the
mah
bh
rata
has
often
been
supposed
to
prove
the
application
of
the
name
long
before
the
predominance
of
the
dynasty
but
the
coupling
of
that
name
with
the
still
surviving
as
the
people
of
dardistan
on
the
indus
suggests
it
as
more
probable
that
those
were
a
kindred
race
of
mountaineers
whose
name
as
in
fact
likewise
remains
applied
to
a
branch
of
the
dard
races
whether
the
of
the
prophet
isaiah
should
be
interpreted
of
the
chinese
is
probably
not
susceptible
of
any
decision
by
the
context
it
appears
certainly
to
indicate
a
people
of
the
extreme
east
or
south
the
name
probably
came
to
europe
through
the
arabs
who
made
the
of
the
farther
east
into
and
perhaps
sometimes
into
hence
the
of
the
author
of
the
of
the
erythraean
who
appears
to
be
the
first
extant
writer
to
employ
the
name
in
this
form
assuming
max
müller
view
that
he
belongs
to
the
century
hence
also
the
and
of
ptolemy
it
has
often
indeed
been
denied
that
the
sinae
of
ptolemy
really
represented
the
chinese
but
if
we
compare
the
statement
of
marcianus
of
heraclea
a
mere
condenser
of
ptolemy
when
he
tells
us
that
the
nations
of
the
sinae
lie
at
the
extremity
of
the
habitable
world
and
adjoin
the
eastern
terra
incognita
with
that
of
cosmas
who
says
in
speaking
of
a
name
of
which
no
one
can
question
the
application
to
china
that
beyond
this
there
is
neither
habitation
nor
navigation
we
can
not
doubt
the

region
to
be
meant
by
both

error
of

the

a
closed
basin
rendered
it
but
that
he
should
misplace
the
chinese
coast
but
considering
that
the
name
of
has
come
down
among
the
arabs
from
time
immemorial
as
applied
to
the
chinese
considering
that
in
the
work
of
ptolemy
this
name
certainly
represented
the
farthest
known
east
and
considering
how
inaccurate
are
ptolemy
configurations
and
longitudes
much
nearer
home
it
seems
almost
as
reasonable
to
deny
the
identity
of
his
india
with
ours
as
to
deny
that
his
sinae
were
chinese
if
we
now
turn
to
the
we
find
this
name
mentioned
by
classic
authors
much
more
frequently
and
at
an
earlier
date
for
the
passages
of
eratosthenes
in
strabo
formerly
supposed
to
speak
of
a
parallel
passing
through
greek
dia
thinôn
are
now
known
to
read
correctly
greek
the
name
indeed
is
familiar
to
the
latin
poets
of
the
augustan
age
but
always
in
a
vague
way
and
usually
with
a
general
reference
to
central
asia
and
the
farther
east
we
find
however
that
the
first
endeavours
to
assign
more
accurately
the
position
of
this
people
which
are
those
of
mela
and
pliny
gravitate
distinctly
towards
china
in
its
northern
aspect
as
the
true
ideal
involved
thus
mela
describes
the
remotest
east
of
asia
as
occupied
by
the
three
races
proceeding
from
south
to
north
indians
seres
and
scyths
just
as
in
a
general
way
we
might
still
say
that
eastern
asia
is
occupied
by
the
indies
china
and
tartary
ptolemy
first
uses
the
names
of
and
the
former
for
the
chief
city
the
latter
for
the
country
of
the
seres
and
as
usual
defines
their
position
with
a
precision
far
beyond
what
his
knowledge
justified
the
necessary
result
of
his
system
yet
even
his
definition
of
serice
is
most
consistent
with
the
view
that
this
name
indicated
the
chinese
empire
in
its
northern
aspect
for
he
carries
it
eastward
to
the
degree
of
longitude
which
is
also
according
to
his
calculation
in
a
lower
latitude
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
sinae
ammianus
marcellinus
devotes
some
paragraphs
to
a
description
of
the
seres
and
their
country
one
passage
of
which
is
startling
at
first
sight
in
its
seeming
allusion
to
the
great
wall
and
in
this
sense
it
has
been
rashly
interpreted
by
lassen
and
by
reinaud
but
ammianus
is
merely
converting
ptolemy
dry
tables
into
fine
writing
and
speaks
only
of
an
encircling
rampart
of
mountains
within
which
the
spacious
and
happy
valley
of
the
seres
lies
it
is
true
that
ptolemy
makes
his
serice
extend
westward
to
imaus
to
pamir
but
the
chinese
empire
so
extend
at
that
epoch
and
we
find
lieut
john
wood
in
speaking
of
as
lying
immediately
beyond
pamir
just
as
the
arabs
of
the
century
spoke
of
the
country
beyond
the
jaxartes
as
and
as
ptolemy
spoke
of
as
immediately
beyond
imaus
if
we
fuse
into
one
the
ancient
notices
of
the
seres
and
their
country
omitting
anomalous
statements
and
manifest
fables
the
result
will
be
somewhat
as
follows
the
region
of
the
seres
is
a
vast
and
populous
country
touching
on
the
east
the
ocean
and
the
limits
of
the
habitable
world
and
extending
west
to
imaus
and
the
confines
of
bactria
the
people
are
civilized
mild
just
and
frugal
eschewing
collisions
with
their
neighbours
and
even
shy
of
close
intercourse
but
not
averse
to
dispose
of
their
own
products
of
which
raw
silk
is
the
staple
but
which
included
also
fine
furs
and
iron
of
remarkable
quality
that
is
manifestly
a
definition
of
the
chinese
that
greek
and
roman
knowledge
of
the
true
position
of
so
remote
a
nation
should
at
best
have
been
somewhat
hazy
is
nothing
wonderful
and
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
the
view
entertained
by
the
ancient
chinese
of
the
roman
empire
and
its
inhabitants
under
the
name
of
had
some
striking
points
of
analogy
to
those
views
of
the
chinese
which
are
indicated
in
the
classical
descriptions
of
the
seres
there
can
be
no
mistaking
the
fact
that
in
this
case
also
the
great
object
was
within
the
horizon
of
vision
yet
the
details
ascribed
to
it
are
often
far
from
being
true
characteristics
being
only
the
accidents
of
its
outer
borders
medieval
cathay
is
the
name
by
which
the
chinese
empire
was
known
to
medieval
europe
and
it
is
in
its
original
form
that
china
is
still
known
in
russia
and
to
most
of
the
nations
of
central
asia
west
of
russia
this
name
has
long
ceased
to
be
a
geographical
expression
but
it
is
associated
with
a
remarkable
phase
in
the
history
of
geography
and
commerce
the
name
first
became
known
to
europe
in
the
century
when
the
vast
conquests
of
jenghiz
khan
and
his
house
drew
a
new
and
vivid
attention
to
asia
for
some
three
centuries
previously
the
northern
provinces
of
china
had
been
detached
from
indigenous
rule
and
subject
to
northern
conquerors
the
first
of
these
foreign
dynasties
was
of
a
race
called
issuing
from
the
basin
of
the
sungari
river
and
supposed
but
doubtfully
to
have
been
of
the
blood
of
the
modern
tunguses
the
rule
of
this
race
endured
for
two
centuries
and
originated
the
application
of
the
name
or
to
northern
china
the
dynasty
itself
known
in
chinese
history
as
or
iron
disappeared
from
china
but
the
name
remained
attached
to
the
territory
which
they
had
ruled
the
khitán
were
displaced
by
the
nüchih
or
race
akin
to
the
modern
manchus
these
reigned
under
the
title
of
or
golden
till
jenghiz
and
his
mongols
invaded
them
in
turn
in
the
conquest
of
the
kin
empire
was
completed
and
the
dynasty
extinguished
under
ogdai
ogotai
the
son
and
successor
of
jenghiz
khan
forty
years
later
in
the
reign
of
kublai
grandson
and
ablest
successor
of
jenghiz
the
mongol
rule
was
extended
over
southern
china
which
till
then
had
remained
under
a
native
dynasty
the
sung
holding
its
royal
residence
in
a
vast
and
splendid
city
now
known
as
but
then
as
or
more
commonly
as
the
court
the
southern
empire
was
usually
called
by
the
conquerors
or
as
some
of
the
old
travellers
write
a
name
which
western
asiatics
seem
to
have
identified
with
from
the
sanskrit
one
of
the
names
by
which
china
was
known
to
the
traders
from
persian
and
arabian
ports
the
conquests
of
jenghiz
and
his
successors
had
spread
not
only
over
china
and
the
adjoining
east
but
westward
also
over
all
northern
asia
persia
armenia
part
of
asia
minor
and
russia
threatening
to
deluge
christendom
though
the
mongol
wave
retired
as
it
seemed
almost
by
an
immediate
act
of
providence
when
europe
lay
at
its
feet
it
had
levelled
or
covered
all
political
barriers
from
the
frontier
of
poland
to
the
yellow
sea
and
when
western
europe
recovered
from
its
alarm
asia
lay
open
as
never
before
or
since
to
the
inspection
of
christendom
princes
envoys
priests
visited
the
court
of
the
great
khan
in
mongolia
and
besides
these
the
accidents
of
war
commerce
or
opportunity
carried
a
variety
of
persons
from
various
classes
of
human
life
into
the
depths
of
asia
is
worthy
of
the
grateful
remembrance
of
all
christian
people
says
an
able
missionary
friar
of
the
next
age
ricold
of
monte
croce
that
just
at
the
time
when
god
sent
forth
into
the
eastern
parts
of
the
world
the
tatars
to
slay
and
to
be
slain
he
also
sent
into
the
west
his
faithful
and
blessed
servants
dominic
and
francis
to
enlighten
instruct
and
build
up
in
the
faith
whatever
on
the
whole
may
be
thought
of
the
world
debt
to
dominic
it
is
to
the
two
mendicant
orders
but
especially
to
the
franciscans
that
we
owe
a
vast
amount
of
information
about
medieval
asia
and
among
other
things
the
first
mention
of
among
the
many
strangers
who
reached
mongolia
were
john
de
plano
carpini
and
william
of
rubruk
rubruquis
in
french
flanders
both
franciscan
friars
of
high
intelligence
who
happily
have
left
behind
them
reports
of
their
observations
carpini
after
mentioning
the
wars
of
jenghiz
against
the
goes
on
to
speak
of
that
people
as
follows
now
these
are
heathen
men
and
have
a
written
character
of
their
own
they
seem
indeed
to
be
kindly
and
polished
folks
enough
they
have
no
beard
and
in
character
of
countenance
have
a
considerable
resemblance
to
the
mongols
are
as
our
ethnologists
would
say
but
are
not
so
broad
in
the
face
they
have
a
peculiar
language
their
betters
as
craftsmen
in
every
art
practised
by
man
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
whole
world
their
country
is
very
rich
in
corn
in
wine
in
gold
and
silver
in
silk
and
in
every
kind
of
produce
tending
to
the
support
of
mankind
the
notice
of
rubruk
shrewder
and
more
graphic
runs
thus
farther
on
is
great
cathay
which
i
take
to
be
the
country
which
was
anciently
called
the
land
of
the
seres
for
the
best
silk
stuffs
are
still
got
from
them
the
sea
lies
between
it
and
india
those
cathayans
are
little
fellows
speaking
much
through
the
nose
and
as
is
general
with
all
those
eastern
people
their
eyes
are
very
narrow
they
are
artists
in
every
kind
and
their
physicians
have
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
virtues
of
herbs
and
an
admirable
skill
in
diagnosis
by
the
pulse
the
common
money
of
cathay
consists
of
pieces
of
about
a
palm
in
length
and
breadth
upon
which
certain
lines
are
printed
resembling
the
seal
of
mangu
khan
they
do
their
writing
with
a
pencil
such
as
painters
paint
with
and
a
single
character
of
theirs
comprehends
several
letters
so
as
to
form
a
whole
word
here
we
have
not
only
what
is
probably
the
first
european
notice
of
but
a
recognition
of
the
peculiarity
of
chinese
writing
and
a
perception
that
puts
to
shame
the
perverse
boggling
of
later
critics
over
the
identity
of
these
cathayans
with
the
seres
of
classic
fame
but
though
these
travellers
saw
cathayans
in
the
bazaars
in
the
great
khan
camps
the
first
actual
visitors
of
cathay
itself
were
the
polo
family
and
it
is
to
the
book
of
marco
polo
recollections
mainly
that
cathay
owed
the
growing
familiarity
of
its
name
in
europe
during
the
and
centuries
it
is
however
a
great
mistake
to
suppose
as
has
often
been
assumed
that
the
residence
of
the
polos
in
that
country
remained
an
isolated
fact
they
were
but
the
pioneers
of
a
very
considerable
intercourse
which
endured
till
the
decay
of
the
mongol
dynasty
in
cathay
for
about
half
a
century
we
have
no
evidence
that
either
in
the
or
century
cathayans
chinese
ever
reached
europe
but
it
is
possible
that
some
did
at
least
in
the
former
century
for
during
the
campaigns
of
hulagu
in
persia
and
the
reigns
of
his
successors
chinese
engineers
were
employed
on
the
banks
of
the
tigris
and
chinese
astrologers
and
physicians
could
be
consulted
at
tabriz
many
diplomatic
communications
passed
between
the
hulaguid
ilkhans
and
the
princes
of
christendom
the
former
as
the
great
khan
liegemen
still
received
from
him
their
seals
of
state
and
two
of
their
letters
which
survive
in
the
archives
of
france
exhibit
the
vermilion
impressions
of
those
seals
in
chinese
characters
perhaps
affording
the
earliest
specimen
of
that
character
which
reached
western
europe
just
as
the
polos
were
reaching
their
native
city
after
an
absence
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
the
forerunner
of
a
new
series
of
travellers
was
entering
southern
china
by
way
of
the
indian
seas
this
was
john
of
monte
corvino
another
franciscan
who
already
some
fifty
years
of
age
was
plunging
into
that
great
ocean
of
paganism
to
preach
the
gospel
according
to
his
lights
after
years
of
uphill
and
solitary
toil
converts
began
to
multiply
coadjutors
joined
him
the
papal
see
became
cognizant
of
the
harvest
that
was
being
reaped
in
the
far
east
it
made
friar
john
archbishop
in
cambaluc
or
peking
with
patriarchal
authority
and
sent
him
batches
of
suffragan
bishops
and
preachers
of
his
own
order
the
roman
church
spread
churches
and
minorite
houses
were
established
at
cambaluc
at
zayton
or
in
at
and
elsewhere
and
the
missions
flourished
under
the
smile
of
the
great
khan
as
the
jesuit
missions
did
for
a
time
under
the
manchu
emperors
three
centuries
and
a
half
later
archbishop
john
was
followed
to
the
grave
about
by
mourning
multitudes
of
pagans
and
christians
alike
several
of
the
bishops
and
friars
who
served
under
him
have
left
letters
or
other
memoranda
of
their
experience
andrew
bishop
of
zayton
john
of
cora
afterwards
archbishop
of
sultania
in
persia
and
odoric
of
pordenone
whose
fame
as
a
pious
traveller
won
from
the
at
his
funeral
a
beatification
which
the
church
was
fain
to
seal
the
only
ecclesiastical
narrative
regarding
cathay
of
which
we
are
aware
subsequent
to
the
time
of
archbishop
john
is
that
which
has
been
gathered
from
the
recollections
of
giovanni
de
marignolli
a
florentine
franciscan
who
was
sent
by
pope
benedict
xii
with
a
mission
to
the
great
khan
in
return
for
one
from
that
potentate
which
arrived
at
avignon
from
cathay
in
and
who
spent
four
years
at
the
court
of
cambaluc
as
legate
of
the
holy
see
these
recollections
are
found
dispersed
incoherently
over
a
chronicle
of
bohemia
which
the
traveller
wrote
by
order
of
the
emperor
charles
whose
chaplain
he
was
after
his
return
but
intercourse
during
the
period
in
question
was
not
confined
to
ecclesiastical
channels
commerce
also
grew
up
and
flourished
for
a
time
even
along
the
vast
line
that
stretches
from
genoa
and
florence
to
the
marts
of
and
the
record
is
very
fragmentary
and
imperfect
but
many
circumstances
and
incidental
notices
show
how
frequently
the
remote
east
was
reached
by
european
traders
in
the
first
half
of
the
century
a
state
of
things
which
it
is
very
difficult
to
realize
when
we
see
how
all
those
regions
when
reopened
to
knowledge
two
centuries
later
seemed
to
be
discoveries
as
new
as
the
empires
which
about
the
same
time
cortes
and
pizarro
were
conquering
in
the
west
this
commercial
intercourse
probably
began
about
john
of
monte
corvino
writing
in
says
it
was
twelve
years
since
he
had
heard
any
news
from
europe
the
only
western
stranger
who
had
arrived
in
all
that
time
being
a
certain
lombard
chirurgeon
probably
one
of
the
who
got
hard
measure
at
home
in
those
days
who
had
spread
the
most
incredible
blasphemies
about
the
roman
curia
and
the
order
of
st
francis
yet
even
on
his
first
entrance
to
cathay
friar
john
had
been
accompanied
by
one
master
peter
of
lucolongo
whom
he
describes
as
a
faithful
christian
man
and
a
great
merchant
and
who
seems
to
have
remained
many
years
at
peking
the
letter
of
andrew
bishop
of
zayton
quotes
the
opinion
of
genoese
merchants
at
that
port
regarding
a
question
of
exchanges
odoric
who
was
in
cathay
about
refers
for
confirmation
of
the
wonders
which
he
related
of
the
great
city
of
cansay
or
to
the
many
persons
whom
he
had
met
at
venice
since
his
return
who
had
themselves
been
witnesses
of
those
marvels
and
marignolli
some
twenty
years
later
found
attached
to
one
of
the
convents
at
zayton
in
a
or
factory
for
the
accommodation
of
the
christian
merchants
but
by
far
the
most
distinct
and
notable
evidence
of
the
importance
and
frequency
of
european
trade
with
cathay
of
which
silk
and
silk
goods
formed
the
staple
is
to
be
found
in
the
commercial
of
francesco
balducci
pegolotti
a
clerk
and
factor
of
the
great
florentine
house
of
the
bardi
which
was
brought
to
the
ground
about
that
time
by
its
dealings
with
edward
iii
of
england
this
book
called
by
its
author
di
divisamenti
di
is
a
sort
of
devoting
successive
chapters
to
the
various
ports
and
markets
of
his
time
detailing
the
nature
of
imports
and
exports

and

the
first
two
chapters
of
this
work
contain
instructions
for
the
merchant
proceeding
to
cathay
and
it
is
evident
from
the
terms
used
that
the
road
thither
was
not
unfrequently
travelled
by
european
merchants
from
whom
pegolotti
had
derived
his
information
the
route
which
he
describes
lay

so

peking
particulars
are
given
as
to
the
silver
ingots
which
formed
the
currency
of
tatary
and
the
of
cathay
that
the
ventures
on
this
trade
were
not
insignificant
is
plain
from
the
example
taken
by
the
author
to
illustrate
the
question
of
expenses
on
the
journey
which
is
that
of
a
merchant
investing
in
goods
there
to
the
amount
of
some
in
actual
gold
value
not
as
calculated
by
any
fanciful
and
fallacious
equation
of
values
of
the
same
remarkable
phase
of
history
that
we
are
here
considering
we
have
also
a
number
of
notices
by
mahommedan
writers
the
establishment
of
the
mongol
dynasty
in
persia
by
which
the
great
khan
was
acknowledged
as
lord
paramount
led
as
we
have
already
noticed
in
part
to
a
good
deal
of
intercourse
and
some
of
the
persian
historians
writing
at
tabriz
under
the
patronage
of
the
mongol
princes
have
told
us
much
about
cathay
especially
rashiduddin
the
great
minister
and
historian
of
the
dynasty
died
we
have
also
in
the
book
of
the
moorish
traveller
ibn
batuta
who
visited
china
about
very
many
curious
and
in
great
part
true
notices
though
it
is
not
possible
to
give
credence
to
the
whole
of
this
episode
in
his
extensive
travels
about
the
time
of
the
traveller
first
named
the
throne
of
the
degenerate
descendants
of
jenghiz
began
to
totter
to
its
fall
and
we
have
no
knowledge
of
any
frank
visitor
to
cathay
in
that
age
later
than
marignolli
missions
and
merchants
alike
disappear
from
the
field
we
hear
indeed
once
and
again
of
ecclesiastics
despatched
from
avignon
but
they
go
forth
into
the
darkness
and
are
heard
of
no
more
islam
with
all
its
jealousy
and
exclusiveness

recovered
its
grasp
over
central

the
nestorian
christianity
which
once
had
prevailed
so
widely
was
vanishing
and
the
new
rulers
of

reverted
to
the
old
national
policy
and

upon
the
farther

with
those
cities
of
which
the
old
travellers
had
told
such
marvels
cambaluc
and
cansay
zayton
and
chinkalan
and
when
the
veil
rose
before
the
portuguese
and
spanish
explorers
of
the
century
those
names
are
heard
no
more
in
their
stead
we
have
china

hangchow

canton
not
only
were
the
old
names
forgotten
but
the
fact
that
those
places
had
ever
been
known
before
was
forgotten
also
gradually
new
missionaries
went
forth
from
rome
jesuits
and
dominicans
now
new
converts
were
made
and
new
vicariates
constituted
but
the
old
franciscan
churches
and
the
nestorianism
with
which
they
had
battled
had
alike
been
swallowed
up
in
the
ocean
of
pagan
indifference
in
time
a
wreck
or

floated
to
the
surface
a
latin
bible
or
a
piece
of
catholic
sculpture
and
when
the
intelligent
missionaries
called
marco
polo
to
mind
and
studied
his
story
one
and
another
became
convinced
that
cathay
and
china
were
one
but
for
a
long
time
all
but
a
sagacious
few
continued
to
regard
cathay
as
a
region
distinct
from
any
of
the
indies
whilst
well
on
into
the
century
continued
to
represent
it
as
a
great
country
lying
entirely
to
the
north
of
china
and
stretching
to
the
arctic
sea
it
was
cathay
with
its
outlying
island
of
zipangu
japan
that
columbus
sought
to
reach
by
sailing
westward
penetrated
as
he
was
by
his
intense
conviction
of
the
smallness
of
the
earth
and
of
the
vast
extension
of
asia
eastward
and
to
the
day
of
his
death
he
was
full
of
the
imagination
of
the
proximity
of
the
domain
of
the
great
khan
to
the
islands
and
coasts
which
he
had
discovered
and
such
imaginations
are
curiously
embodied
in
some
of
the
maps
of
the
early
century
which
intermingle
on
the
same
the
new
discoveries
from
labrador
to
brazil
with
the
provinces
and

cathay
had
been
the
aim
of
the
first
voyage
of

to
be
the
object
of
many
adventurous
voyages
by
english
and
hollanders
to
the

till
far
on
in
the
century
at
least
one
memorable
also
was
made
by
englishmen
of
which
the
exploration
of
a
to
cathay
was
a
chief
object
that
in
which
anthony
jenkinson
and
the
two
johnsons
reached
bokhara
by
way
of
russia
in
the
country
of
which
they
collected
notices
at
that
city

still
known
to
them
only
as
and
its
great
capital
only
as
cathay
as
a
supposed
separate
entity

considered
to

through

with
the
specific
object
of
determining
whether
the
cathay
of
old
european
writers
and
of
modern
mahommedans
was
or
was
not
a
distinct
region
from
that
china

now
for
some

not

the

of
the
narrative
of
his
journey
in
the

chinese
literature
contains
no
record
of
any
kind
which
might
justify
us
in
assuming
that
the
nucleus
of
the
nation
may
have
immigrated
from
some
other
part
of
the
world
and
the
several
ingenious
theories
pointing
to
babylonia
egypt
india
khotan
and
other
seats
of
ancient
civilization
as
the
of
ethnical
wanderings
must
be
dismissed
as
untenable
whether
the
chinese
were
seated
in
their
later
homes
from
times
immemorial
as
their
own
historians
assume
or
whether
they
arrived
there
from
abroad
as
some
foreign
scholars
have
pretended
can
not
be
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
historical
critics
indeed
anthropological
arguments
seem
to
contradict
the
idea
of
any
connexion
with
babylonians
egyptians
assyrians
or
indians
the
earliest
hieroglyphics
of
the
chinese
ascribed
by
them
to
the
shang
dynasty
second
millennium
betray
the
mongol
character
of
the
nation
that
invented
them
by
the
decided
obliquity
of
the
human
eye
wherever
it
appears
in
an
ideograph
in
a
pair
of
eyes
as
shown
in
the
most
ancient
pictorial
or
sculptural
representations
in
the
west
the
four
corners
may
be
connected
by
a
horizontal
straight
line
whereas
lines
drawn
through
the
eyes
of
one
of
the
oldest
chinese
hieroglyphics
cross
each
other
at
a
sharp
angle
as
shown
in
the
accompanying
diagrams

chinese
this
does
not
seem
to
speak
for
racial
consanguinity
any
more
than
the
curled
heads
and
bearded
faces
of
assyrian
sculptures
as
compared
to
the
and
almost
beardless
chinese
similarities
in
the
creation
of
cultural
elements
may
it
is
true
be
shown
to
exist
on
either
side
even
at
periods
when
mutual
intercourse
was
probably
out
of
the
question
but
this
may
be
due
to
uniformity
in
the
construction
of
the
human
brain
which
leads
man
in
different
parts
of
the
world
to
arrive
at
similar
ideas
under
similar
conditions
or
to
prehistoric
connexions
which
it
is
as
impossible
for
us
to
trace
now
as
is
the
origin
of
mankind
itself
our
standpoint
as
regards
the
origin
of
the
chinese
race
is
therefore
that
of
the
agnostic
all
we
can
do
is
to
reproduce
the
tradition
as
it
is
found
in
chinese
literature
this
tradition
as
applying
to
the
very
earliest
periods
may
be
nothing
more
than
historical
superstition
yet
it
has
its
historical
importance
supposing
it
were
possible
to
prove
that
none
of
the
persons
mentioned
in
the
bible
from
adam
down
to
the
apostles
ever
lived
even
the
most
sceptical
critic
would
still
have
to
admit
that
the
history
of
a
great
portion
of
the
human
race
has
been
materially
affected
by
the
belief
in
the
examples
of
their
alleged
lives
something
similar
may
be
said
of
the
alleged
earliest
history
of
the
chinese
with
its
model
emperors
and
detestable
tyrants
the
accounts
of
which
whether
based
on
reality
or
not
have
exercised
much
influence
on
the
development
of
the
nation
the
chinese
have
developed
their
theories
of
prehistoric
life
speculation
as
to
the
origin
and
gradual
evolution
of
their
civilization
has
resulted
in
the
expression
of
views
by
authors
who
may
have
reconstructed
their
systems
from
remnants
of
ancestral
life
revealed
by
excavations
or
from
observation
of
neighbouring
nations
living
in
a
state
of
barbarism
this
may
account
for
a
good
deal
of
the
repetition
found
in
the
chinese
mythological
and
legendary
narratives
the
personal
and
chronological
part
of
which
may
have
been
invented
merely
as
a
framework
for
illustrating
social
and
cultural
progress
the
scene
of
action
of
all
the
prehistoric
figures
from
the
first
human
being
down
to
the
beginning
of
real
history
has
been
laid
in
a
part
of
the
world
which
has
never
been
anything
but
chinese
territory
epoch
millions
of
years
ago
was
followed
by
ten
distinct
periods
of
sovereigns
including
the
heavenly
emperors
the
terrestrial
emperors
and
the
human
emperors
the
or
and
the
fire
producer
the
prometheus
of
the
chinese
who
borrowed
fire
from
the
stars
for
the
benefit
of
man
several
of
the
characteristic
phases
of
cultural
progress
and
social
organization
have
been
ascribed
to
this
mythological
period
authors
of
less
fertile
imagination
refer
them
to
later
times
when
the
heroes
of
their
accounts
appear
in
shapes
somewhat
resembling
human
beings
rather
than
as
gods
and
demigods
the
chinese
themselves
look
upon
as
their
first
historical
emperor
and
they
place
his
lifetime
in
the
years
some
accounts
represent
him
as
a
supernatural
being
and
we
see
him
depicted
as
a
human
figure
with
a
fish
tail
something
like
a
mermaid
he
is
credited
with
having
established
social
order
among
his
people
who
before
him
had
lived
like
animals
in
the
wilds
the
social
chaos
out
of
which
chinese
society
arose
is
described
as
being
characterized
by
the
absence
of
family
life
for
children
knew
only
their
mothers
and
not
their
fathers
introduced
matrimony
and
in
so
doing
he
placed
man
as
the
husband
at
the
head
of
the
family
and
abolished
the
original
matriarchate
this
quite
corresponds
with
his
views
on
the
dualism
in
natural
philosophy
of
which
he
is
supposed
to
have
laid
the
germs
by
the
invention
of
the
eight
symbols
each
consisting
of
three
parallel
lines
broken
or
continuous
the
continuous
lines
represented
the
male
element
in
nature
the
broken
ones
the
female
it
is
characteristic
that
the
same
ruler
who
assigned
to
man
his
position
as
the
head
of
the
family
is
also
credited
with
the
invention
of
that
natural
philosophy
of
the
male
and
female
principles
according
to
which
all
good
things
and
qualities
were
held
to
be
male
while
their
less
sympathetic
opposites
were
female
such
as
heaven
and
earth
sun
and
moon
day
and
night
south
and
north
if
these
traditions
really
represent
the
oldest
prehistoric
creations
of
the
popular
mind
it
would
almost
seem
that
the
most
ancient
chinese
shared
that
naïve
sentiment
which
caused
our
own
forefathers
to
invent
gender
the
difference
is
that
with
us
the
conception
survives
merely
in
the
language
where
the
article
or
suffixes
mark
gender
whereas
with
the
chinese
whose
language
does
not
express
gender
it
survives
in
their
system
of
metaphysics
for
all
their
attempts
at
fathoming
the
secrets
of
nature
are
based
on
the
idea
that
male
or
female
powers
are
inherent
in
all
matter
to
the
same
emperor
are
ascribed
many
of
the
elementary
inventions
which
raise
man
from
the
life
of
a
brute
to
that
of
a
social
being
he
taught
his
people
to
hunt
to
fish
and
to
keep
flocks
he
constructed
musical
instruments
and
replaced
a
kind
of
previously
in
use
by
a
system
of
hieroglyphics
all
this
can
not
of
course
be
considered
as
history
but
it
shows
that
the
authors
of
later
centuries
who
credited
with
certain
inventions
were
not
quite
illogical
in
starting
from
the
matriarchal
chaos
after
which
he
is
said
to
have
organized
society
with
occupations
corresponding
to
those
of
a
period
of
hunting
fishing
and
herding
this
period
was
bound
to
be
followed
by
a
further
step
towards
the
final
development
of
the
nation
social
condition
and
we
find
it
quite
logically
succeeded
by
a
period
of
agricultural
life
personified
in
the
emperor
supposed
to
have
lived
in
the
century
his
name
may
be
freely
translated
as
divine
labourer
and
to
him
the
chinese
ascribe
the
invention
of
agricultural
implements
and
the
discovery
of
the
medicinal
properties
of
numerous
plants
the
third
historical
emperor
was
the
yellow
emperor
according
to
the
literal
translation
the
herodotus
of
the
chinese
begins
his
history
with
him
but
and
are
referred
to
in
texts
much
older
than
this
historian
though
many
details
relating
to
their
alleged
reigns
have
been
added
in
later
times
extended
the
boundaries
of
the
empire
described
as
being
originally
confined
to
a
limited
territory
near
the
banks
of
the
yellow
river
and
the
present
city
of
here
were
the
sites
of
cities
used
as
capitals
of
the
empire
under
various
names
during
long
periods
since
remote
antiquity
to
whose
reign
is
said
to
have
commenced
in
according
to
one
source
and
in
according
to
another
are
ascribed
most
of
the
cultural
innovations
which
historians
were
not
able
otherwise
to
locate
within
historical
times
under
we
find
the
first
mention
of
a
nation
called
the
who
occupied
the
north
of
his
empire
and
with
whom
he
is
represented
to
have
engaged
in
warfare
the
chinese
identify
this
name
with
that
of
the
their
old
hereditary
enemy
and
the
ancestors
of
attila
huns
even
though
the
details
of
these
legendary
accounts
may
deserve
little
confidence
there
must
have
been
an
old
tradition
that
a
nation
called
the
occupying
the
northern
confines
of
china
were
the
ancestors
of
the
tribes
well
known
in
historical
times
a
scion
of
whose
great
khans
settled
in
territory
belonging
to
the
king
of
sogdiana
during
the
first
century
levied
tribute
from
his
neighbours
the
alans
and
with
his
small
but
warlike
horde
initiated
that
era
of
migrations
which
led
to
the
overrunning
of
europe
with
tatars
and
represent
a
group
of
rulers
comprised
by
the
chinese
under
the
name
of
the
three
emperors
although
we
have
no
reason
to
deny
their
existence
the
details
recorded
concerning
them
contain
enough
in
the
way
of
improbabilities
to
justify
us
in
considering
them
as
mythical
creations
the
chronology
too
is
apparently
quite
fictitious
for
the
time
allotted
to
their
reigns
is
much
too
long
as
a
term
of
government
for
a
single
human
life
and
on
the
other
hand
much
too
short
if
we
measure
it
by
the
cultural
progress
said
to
have
been
brought
about
in
it
period
of
hunting
life
must
have
lasted
many
generations
before
it
led
to
the
agricultural
period
represented
by
the
name
and
this
period
in
turn
could
not
possibly
have
led
within
a
little
more
than
one
hundred
years
to
the
enormous
progress
ascribed
to
under
the
latter
ruler
a
regular
board
of
historians
is
said
to
have
been
organized
with
as
president
who
is
known
also
as
the
emperor
of
historians
the
reputed
inventor
of
hieroglyphic
writing
placed
by
some
authors
into
the
period
and
worshipped
as
god
of

to
the
present
day
is
supposed
to
have
been
the
first
builder
of
temples
houses
and
cities
to
have
regulated
the
calendar
to
which
he
added
the
intercalary

most
of
the
stories
regarding
the
three
emperors
are
told
in
comparatively
late
records
the
sometimes
described
as
the
canon
of

our
oldest
source
of

supposed
to
have
been
edited
by

himself

nothing
of
and
but
it
begins
by
extolling
the
virtues
of
the
emperor
and
his
successor
yau
and
shun
are
probably
the
most
popular
names
in
chinese
history
as
taught
in
china
whatever
good
qualities
may
be
imagined
of
the
rulers
of
a
great
nation
have
been
heaped
upon
their
heads
and
the
example
of
their
lives
has
at
all
times
been
held
up
by
confucianists
as
the
height
of
perfection
in
a
sovereign
character
yau
whose
reign
has
been
placed
by
the
fictitious
standard
chronology
of
the
chinese
in
the
years
and
about
years
later
by
the
less
extravagant
annals
of
the
bamboo
books
is
represented
as
the
patron
of
certain
astronomers
who
had
to
watch
the
heavenly
bodies
and
much
has
been
written
about
the
reputed
astronomical
knowledge
of
the
chinese
in
this
remote
period
names
like
deguignes
gaubil
biot
and
schlegel
are
among
those
of
the
investigators
on
the
other
side
are
the
sceptics
who
maintain
that
later
editors
interpolated
statements
which
could
have
been
made
only
with
the
astronomical
knowledge
possessed
by
their
own
contemporaries
according
to
an
old
legend
shun
banished
the
four
wicked
ones
to
distant
territories
one
of
these
bore
the
name
glutton
called
also
is
also
the
name
of
an
ornament
very
common
on
the
surface
of
the
most
ancient
bronze
vessels
showing
the
distorted
face
of
some
ravenous
animal
the
as
a
tribe
are
said
to
have
been
the
forefathers
of
the
tangutans
the
tibetans
and
the
in
the
of
china
this
legend
may
be
interpreted
as
indicating
that
the
races
in
the
have
come
to
their
present
seats
by
migration
from
central
china
in
remote
antiquity
during
yau
reign
a
catastrophe
reminding
one
of
the
biblical
deluge
threatened
the
chinese
world
the
emperor
held
his
minister
of
works
kun
responsible
for
this
misfortune
probably
an
inundation
of
the
yellow
river
such
as
has
been
witnessed
by
the
present
generation
its
horrors
are
described
with
poetical
exaggeration
in
the
when
the
efforts
to
stop
the
floods
had
proved
futile
for
nine
years
yau
wished
to
abdicate
and
he
selected
a
virtuous
young
man
of
the
name
of
shun
as
his
successor
among
the
legends
told
about
this
second
model
emperor
is
the
story
that
he
had
a
board
before
his
palace
on
which
every
subject
was
permitted
to
note
whatever
faults
he
had
to
find
with
his
government
and
that
by
means
of
a
drum
suspended
at
his
palace
gate
attention
might
be
drawn
to
any
complaint
that
was
to
be
made
to
him
since
kun
had
not
succeeded
in
stopping
the
floods
he
was
dismissed
and
his
son
yü
was
appointed
in
his
stead
probably
the
waters
began
to
subside
of
their
own
accord
but
yü
has
been
praised
up
as
the
national
hero
who
by
his
engineering
works
saved
his
people
from
utter
destruction
his
labours
in
this
direction
are
described
in
a
special
section
of
the
confucian
account
known
as
tribute
of
yü
yü
merit
has
in
the
sequel
been
exaggerated
so
as
to
credit
him
with
more
than
human
powers
he
is
supposed
to
have
cut
canals
through
the
hills
in
order
to
furnish
outlets
to
the
floods
and
to
have
performed
feats
of
engineering
compared
to
which
according
to
von
richthofen
the
construction
of
the
st
gotthard
tunnel
without
blasting
materials
would
be
play
and
all
this
within
a
few
years
hia
as
a
reward
for
his
services
yü
was
selected
to
succeed
shun
as
emperor
he
divided
the
empire
into
nine
provinces
the
description
of
which
in
the
chapter
of
the
canon
of
history
bears
a
suspicious
resemblance
to
later
accounts
yü
reign
has
been
assigned
to
the
years
and
the
hia
dynasty
of
which
he
became
the
head
has
been
made
to
extend
to
the
overthrow
in
of
kié
its
eighteenth
and
last
emperor
a
cruel
tyrant
of
the
most
vicious
and
contemptible
character
among
the
hia
emperors
we
find
whose
reign
has
attracted
the
attention
of
european
scholars
by
the
mention
of
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
which
his
court
astronomers
had
failed
to
predict
european
astronomers
and
sinologues
have
brought
much
acumen
to
bear
on
the
problem
involved
in
the
account
in
trying
to
decide
which
of
the
several
eclipses
known
to
have
occurred
about
that
time
was
identical
with
the
one
observed
in
china
under
shang
or
yin
this
period
which
preceded
the
classical
chóu
dynasty
is
made
to
extend
from
to
we
must
now
be
prepared
to
see
an
energetic
or
virtuous
ruler
at
the
head
of
a
dynasty
and
either
a
cruel
tyrant
or
a
contemptible
weakling
at
the
end
of
it
it
seems
natural
that
this
should
be
so
but
chinese
historians
like
the
writers
of
roman
history
have
a
tendency
to
exaggerate
both
good
and
bad
qualities
its
first
sovereign
is
represented
as
a
model
of
goodness
and
of
humane
feeling
towards
his
subjects
even
the
animal
world
benefited
by
his
kindness
inasmuch
as
he
abolished
all
useless
torture
in
the
chase
his
great
minister
i
yin
who
had
greatly
assisted
him
in
securing
the
throne
served
two
of
his
successors
and
are
described
as
good
rulers
among
a
somewhat
indifferent
set
of
monarchs
the
shang
dynasty
like
the
hia
came
to
an
end
through
the
reckless
vice
and
cruelty
of
a
tyrant
with
his
consort
china
had
even
in
those
days
to
maintain
her
position
as
a
civilized
nation
by
keeping
at
bay
the
barbarous
nations
by
which
she
was
surrounded
chief
among
these
were
the
ancestors
of
the
tribes
or
huns
on
the
northern
and
western
boundaries
to
fight
them
to
make
pacts
and
compromises
with
them
and
to
befriend
them
with
gifts
so
as
to
keep
them
out
of
the
imperial
territories
had
been
the
rôle
of
a
palatinate
on
the
western
frontier
the
duchy
of
chóu
while
the
court
of
china
with
its
vicious
emperor
gave
itself
up
to
effeminate
luxury
evil
practices
had
aroused
the
indignation
of
the
palatine
subsequently
known
as
who
in
vain
remonstrated
with
the
emperor
criminal
treatment
of
his
subjects
the
strength
and
integrity
of
character
had
made
him
the
of
that
important
epoch
and
his
name
is
one
of
the
best
known
both
in
history
and
in
literature
the
courage
with
which
he
spoke
his
mind
in
rebuking
his
unworthy
liege
lord
caused
the
emperor
to
imprison
him
his
great
popularity
alone
saving
his
life
during
his
incarceration
extending
over
three
years
he
compiled
the
or
canon
of
changes
supposed
to
be
the
oldest
book
of
chinese
literature
and
certainly
the
one
most
extensively
studied
by
the
nation
son
known
as
was
destined
to
avenge
his
father
and
the
many
victims
of
cruelty
under
his
leadership
the
people
rose
against
the
emperor
and
with
the
assistance
of
his
allies
men
of
the
west
possibly
ancestors
of
the
huns
overthrew
the
shang
dynasty
after
a
decisive
battle
whereupon
committed

by
setting
fire
to
his
palace
the
first
emperor
of
the
new
dynasty
named
after
his
duchy
of
chóu
on
the
western
frontier
was
greatly
assisted
in
consolidating
the
empire
by
his
brother
duke
of
chóu
as
the
loyal
of
and
his
successor
the
duke
of
chóu
laid
the
foundation
of
the
government
institutions
of
the
dynasty
which
became
the
prototype
of
most
of
the
characteristic
features
in
chinese
public
and
social
life
down
to
recent
times
the
brothers
and
adherents
of
the
new
sovereign
were
rewarded
with
fiefs
which
in
the
sequel
grew
into
as
many
states
china
thus
developed
into
a
confederation
resembling
that
of
the
german
empire
inasmuch
as
a
number
of
independent
states
each
having
its
own
sovereign
were
united
under
one
liege
lord
the
emperor
styled
the
son
of
heaven
who
as
high
priest
of
the
nation
reigned
in
the
name
of
heaven
the
emperor
represented
the
nation
in
sacrificing
and
praying
to
god
his
relations
with
his
vassals
and
government
officials
and
those
of
the
heads
of
the
vassal
states
with
their
subjects
as
well
as
of
the
people
among
themselves
were
regulated
by
the
most
rigid
ceremonial
the
dress
to
be
worn
the
speeches
to
be
made
and
the
postures
to
be
assumed
on
all
possible
occasions
whether
at
court
or
in
private
life
were
subject
to
regulations
the
duke
of
chóu
or
whoever
may
have
been
the
creator
of
this
system
showed
deep
wisdom
in
his
speculations
if
he
based
that
immutability
of
government
which
in
the
sequel
became
a
chinese
characteristic
on
the
physical
and
moral
immutability
of
individuals
by
depriving
them
of
all
spontaneous
action
in
public
and
private
life
originally
and
nominally
the
emperor
power
as
the
ruler
over
his
vassals
who
again
ruled
in
his
name
was
unquestionable
and
the
first
few
generations
of
the
dynasty
saw
no
decline
of
the
original
strength
of
central
power
a
certain
loyalty
based
on
the
traditional
ancestral
worship
counteracted
the
desire
to
revolt
the
rightful
heir
to
the
throne
was
responsible
to
his
ancestors
as
his
subjects
were
to
theirs
we
have
to
do
as
our
ancestors
did
the
people
argued
and
since
they
obeyed
the
ancestors
of
our
present
sovereign
we
have
to
be
loyal
to
him
interference
with
this
belief
would
have
amounted
to
a
rupture
as
it
were
in
the
nation
religious
relations
and
as
long
as
the
people
looked
upon
the
emperor
as
the
son
of
heaven
his
moral
power
would
outweigh
strong
armies
sent
against
him
in
rebellion
the
time
came
soon
enough
when
central
power
depended
merely
on
this
spontaneous
loyalty
not
all
the
successors
of
profited
by
the
lessons
given
them
by
past
history
incapacity
excessive
severity
and
undue
weakness
had
created
discontent
and
loosened
the
relations
between
the
emperor
and
his
vassals
increase
in
the
extent
of
the
empire
greatly
added
to
this
decline
of
central
power
for
the
emperor
own
dominion
was
centrally
situated
and
surrounded
by
the
several
confederate
states
its
geographical
position
prevented
it
from
participating
in
the
general
aggrandisement
of
china
and
increase
in
territory
population
and
prestige
had
become
the
privilege
of
boundary
states
tatar
tribes
in
the
north
and
west
and
the
aboriginal
man
barbarians
in
the
south
were
forced
by
warfare
to
yield
land
or
enticed
to
exchange
it
for
goods
or
induced
to
mingle
with
their
chinese
neighbours
thus
producing
a
mixed
population
combining
the
superior
intelligence
of
the
chinese
race
with
the
energetic
and
warlike
spirit
of
barbarians
these
may
be
the
main
reasons
which
gradually
undermined
the
imperial
authority
and
brought
some
of
the
confederate
states
to
the
front
so
as
to
overshadow
the
authority
of
the
son
of
heaven
himself
whose
military
and
financial
resources
were
inferior
to
those
of
several
of
his
vassals
a
few
out
of
the
sovereigns
of
the
chóu
dynasty
were
distinguished
by
extraordinary
qualities
of
the
century
performed
journeys
far
beyond
the
western
frontier
of
his
empire
and
was
successful
in
warfare
against
the
dog
barbarians
described
as
the
ancestors
of
the
or
huns
the
reign
of
was
filled
with
warfare
against
the
tangutans
and
the
huns
called
in
a
contemporaneous
poem
of
the
book
of
odes
but
the
most
noteworthy
reign
in
this
century
is
that
of
the
lascivious
the
oppressiveness
of
whose
government
had
caused
a
bard
represented
in
the
book
of
odes
to
complain
about
the
emperor
evil
ways
the
writer
of
this
poem
refers
to
certain
signs
showing
that
heaven
itself
is
indignant
at
crimes
one
of
these
signs
was
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
which
had
recently
occurred
the
date
and
month
being
clearly
stated
this
date
corresponds
exactly
with
august
and
astronomers
have
calculated
that
on
that
precise
date
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
was
visible
in
north
china
this
of
course
can
not
be
a
mere
accident
and
since
the
date
falls
into
the
sixth
year
of
reign
the
coincidence
is
bound
to
increase
our
confidence
in
that
part
of
chinese
history
our
knowledge
of
it
however
is
due
to
mere
chance
for
the
record
of
the
eclipse
would
probably
not
have
been
preserved
until
our
days
had
it
not
been
interpreted
as
a
kind
of
owing
to
the
peculiarity
of
the
political
situation
it
does
not
follow
therefore
as
some
foreign
critics
assume
that
the
historical
period
begins
as
late
as
reign
china
has
no
architectural
witnesses
to
testify
to
her
antiquity
as
egypt
has
in
her
pyramids
and
temple
ruins
but
the
sacrificial
bronze
vessels
of
the
shang
and
chóu
dynasties
with
their
characteristic
ornaments
and
hieroglyphic
inscriptions
seem
to
support
the
historical
tradition
inasmuch
as
natural
development
may
be
traced
by
the
analysis
of
their
artistic
and
paleographic
phases
counterfeiters
say
a
thousand
years
later
could
not
have
resisted
the
temptation
to
introduce
patterns
and
hieroglyphic
shapes
of
later
periods
and
whatever
bronzes
have
been
assigned
to
the
shang
dynasty
some
time
in
the
second
millennium
exhibit
the
shang
characteristics
the
words
occurring
in
their
inscriptions
carefully
collected
may
be
shown
to
be
confined
to
ideas
peculiar
to
primitive
states
of
cultural
life
not
one
of
them
pointing
to
an
invention
we
may
suspect
to
be
of
later
origin
but
apart
from
this
it
seems
a
matter
of
individual
judgment
how
far
back
beyond
that
indisputable
year
a
student
will
date
the
beginning
of
real
history
in
the
century
central
authority
had
declined
to
such
an
extent
that
the
emperor
was
merely
the
nominal
head
of
the
confederation
the
hegemony
in
the
empire
falling
in
turn
to
one
of
the
five
principal
states
for
which
reason
the
chinese
speak
of
a
period
of
the
five
leaders
the
state
of
corresponding
to
north
had
begun
to
overshadow
the
other
states
by
unprecedented
success
in
economic
enterprise
due
to
the
prudent
advice
of
its
prime
minister
the
philosopher
other
states
attained
leadership
by
success
in
warfare
among
these
leaders
we
see
duke
mu
of
a
state
on
the
western
boundary
which
was
so
much
influenced
by
amalgamation
with
its
hunnic
neighbours
that
the
purely
chinese
states
regarded
it
as
a
barbarian
country
the
emperor
was
in
those
days
a
mere
shadow
several
of
his
vassals
had
grown
strong
enough
to
claim
and
be
granted
the
title
king
and
they
all
tried
to
annihilate
their
neighbours
by
ruse
in
diplomacy
and
by
force
of
arms
without
referring
to
their
common
ruler
for
arbitration
as
they
were
in
duty
bound
in
this
omnium
contra
the
state
of
in
spite
of
repeated
reverses
remained
in
possession
of
the
field
the
period
of
this
general
struggle
is
spoken
of
by
chinese
historians
as
that
of
the
contending
states
like
that
of
the
five
leaders
it
is
full
of
romance
and
the
examples
of
heroism
cowardice
diplomatic
skill
and
philosophical
equanimity
which
fill
the
pages
of
its
history
have
become
the
subject
of
elegant
literature
in
prose
and
poetry
the
political
development
of
the
chóu
dynasty
is
the
exact
counterpart
of
that
of
its
spiritual
life
as
shown
in
the
contemporaneous
literature
the
orthodox
conservative
spirit
which
reflects
the
ethical
views
of
the
emperor
and
his
royal
partisans
is
represented
by
the
name
confucius
the
great
sage
had
collected
old
traditions
and
formulated
the
moral
principles
which
had
been
dormant
in
the
chinese
nation
for
centuries
his
doctrines
tended
to
support
the
maintenance
of
central
power
so
did
those
of
other
members
of
his
school
especially
mencius
filial
love
showed
itself
as
obedience
to

as
loyalty
to
the
emperor
and
his
government
in

life
it
was
the
highest
virtue
according
to
the
confucian
school
the
history
of
the

as
taught
in

in
its
early
part
merely
an
illustration

the
perpetual

was
be
like

and
you
will
be
right
confucianism
was
dominant
during
the
earlier
centuries
of
the
chóu
dynasty
whose
lucky
star
began
to
wane
when
doctrines
opposed
to
it
got
the
upper
hand
the
philosophical
schools
built
up
on
the
doctrines
of
had
in
the
course
of
generations
become
antagonistic
and
found
favour
with
those
who
did
not
endorse
that
loyalty
to
the
emperor
demanded
by
mencius
so
had
other
thinkers
some
of
whom
had
preached
morals
which
were
bound
to
break
up
all
social
relations
like
the
philosopher
of
egotism

according
to

personified
and
the
very
reverse
of
his
ideal
the
duke
of

the
egotism
recommended
by
yang
chu
to
the
individual
had
begun
to
be
practised
on
a
large
scale
by
the
contending
states
their
governments
and
sovereigns
some
of
whom
had
long
discarded
confucian
rites
under
the
influence
of
tatar
neighbours
it
appears
that
the
spirit
which
paved
the
way
towards
the
final
extinction
of

received
its
chief
nourishment
from
the
tatar
element
in
the
population
of
the
northern
and
western
boundary
states
among
these

the
most
prominent
having
placed
itself
in
the
possession
of

of
nearly
all
of

made
war
against
the
last
shadow
emperor
who
had
attempted
to
form
an
alliance
against
the
powerful
usurper
with
the
result
that
the
western
part
of
the
chóu
dominion
was
lost
to
the
aggressor
died
soon
after
and
a
relative
whom
he
had
appointed
regent
was
captured
in
when
the
king
of
put
an
end
to
this
last
remnant
of
the
once
glorious
chóu
dynasty
by
annexing
its
territory
the
king
had
already
secured
the
possession
of
the
nine
tripods
huge
bronze
vases
said
to
have
been
cast
by
the
emperor

as
representing
the
nine
divisions
of
his
empire
and
since
preseryed
in

treasuries
of
all
the
various
emperors
as
a
symbol
of
imperial
power
with
the
loss
of
these
tripods
had
forfeited
the
right
to
call
himself
son
of

another
prerogative
was
the
offering
of
sacrifice
to
the
supreme
ruler
or
god
with
whom
only
the

was
supposed
to
communicate

after
the
fall
of

a
kind
of
interregnum
followed
during
which
china
was
practically
without

this
was
the
time
when
the

itself
as
the

finally
as
the
master
of
all
the
contending

three

wang
his

a
man
of

he
died
in
giving
place
to

the
first
universal
emperor
this
sovereign
was
then
only
thirteen
but
he
speedily
made
his
influence
felt
everywhere
he
chose
the
modern
fu
as
his
capital
and
built
there
a
magnificent
palace
which
was
the
wonder
and
admiration
of
his
contemporaries
he
abolished
the
feudal
system
and
divided
the
country
into
provinces
over
whom
he
set
officers
directly
responsible
to
himself
he
constructed
roads
through
the
empire
he
formed
canals
and
erected
numerous
and
handsome
public
buildings
having
settled
the
internal
affairs
of
his
kingdom
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
enemies
beyond
his
frontier
chief
among
these
were
the
tatars
whose
attacks
had
for
years
disquieted
the
chinese
and
neighbouring
principalities
against
these
foes
he
marched
with
an
army
of
men
exterminating
those
in
the
neighbourhood
of
china
and
driving
the
rest
into
mongolia
on
his
return
from
this
campaign
he
was
called
upon
to
face
a
formidable
rebellion
in
which
had
been
set
on
foot
by
the
adherents
of
the
feudal
princes
whom
he
had
dispossessed
having
crushed
the
rebellion
he
marched
southwards
and
subdued
the
tribes
on
the
south
of
the
ranges
the
inhabitants
of
the
modern
provinces
of

the
limits
of
his
empire
were
thus
as
nearly
as
possible
those
of
modern
china
proper
one
monument
remains
to
bear
witness
to
his
energy
finding
that
the
northern
states
of
chao
and
yen
were
building
lines
of
fortification
along
their
northern
frontier
for
protection
against
the
he
conceived
the
idea
of
building
one
gigantic
wall
which
was
to
stretch
across
the
whole
northern
limit
of
the
huge
empire
from
the
sea
to
the
farthest
western
corner
of

of
this
work
was
begun
under
his
immediate
supervision
in
his
reforming
zeal
made
him
unpopular
with
the
upper
classes
schoolmen
and
pedants
held
up
to
the
admiration
of
the
people
the
heroes
of
the
feudal
times
and
the
advantages
of
the
system
they
administered
seeing
in
this
propaganda
danger
to
the
state
shi
determined
to
break
once
and
for
all
with
the
past
to
this
end
he
ordered
the
destruction
of
all
books
having
reference
to
the
past
history
of
the
empire
and
many
scholars
were
put
to
death
for
failing
in
obedience
to

the
measure
was
unpopular
and
on
his
death
rebellion
broke

debauched
youth

founded
his
right

abolished

that
referring
to
the
destruction

for
like
his
great
predecessor

dreaded
the

he
exchanged
the

that
of
those
of

native

his
successor
however
gave
every
encouragement
to
literature
and
appointed
a
commission
to
restore
as
far
as
possible
the
texts
which
had
been
destroyed
by
shi
in
this
the
commission
was
very
successful
it
was
discovered
that
in
many
cases
the
law
had
been
evaded
while
in
numerous
instances
scholars
were
found
to
write
down
from
memory
the
text
of
books
of
which
all
copies
had
been
destroyed
though
in
some
cases
the
purity
of
the
text
is
doubtful
and
in
other
cases
there
were
undoubted
forgeries
a
period
of
repose
was
now
enjoyed
by
the
empire
there
was
peace
within
its
borders
and
its
frontiers
remained
unchallenged

by
the
who
suffered
many
severe
defeats
thwarted
in
their
attacks

marauders
attacked

much
fighting
drove
their
victims
along

position
of

to
an
end
and
with

disappeared
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
all
semblance
of

the

became
divided
into
two
parts
the

was
brought
to

close
by

glad
to
acknowledge
his

during

sixteen
years
of
his
reign
the
internal
affairs
of

were
comparatively
peaceably
administered
the
emperor
instituted
an
improved
code
of
laws
and
added
volumes
to
the
which
composed
the
imperial
library

his
policy
was
equally
successful
he
defeated
the
tatars

chastised
the
koreans

for
a
long
period
recognized

torn
by

to
strangle
himself

expeditions
against

other
extravagances
laid
so
heavy
a
burden
on

began
again
to
prevail

on

the
rest
of
the
turkish
territory

again
included
within
the
chinese
empire
and
four
military
governorships
were
appointed
in
central
asia
viz
at
kucha
khotan
kharastan
and
kashgar
at
the
same
time
the
frontier
was
extended
as
far
as
eastern
persia
and
the
caspian
sea
so
great
was
now
the
fame
of
china
that
ambassadors
from
nepal
magadha
persia
and
constantinople
came
to
pay
their
court
to
the
emperor
under
there
was
national
unity
and
peace
and
in
consequence
agriculture
and
commerce
as
well
as
literature
flourished
the
emperor
gave
direct
encouragements
to
the
nestorians
and
gave
a
favourable
reception
to
an
embassy
from
mahommed
see
ante
on
the
accession
of
his
wife
wu
how
gained
supreme
influence
and
on
the
death
of
her
husband
in
she
set
aside
his
lawful
successor
and
took
possession
of
the
throne
this
was
the
first
occasion
the
country
was
ruled
by
a
dowager
empress
she
governed
with
discretion
and
her
armies
defeated
the
khitán
in
the
and
also
the
tibetans
who
had
latterly
gained
possession
of
kucha
khotan
and
kashgar
on
her
death
in
partially
left
the
obscurity
in
which
he
had
lived
during
his
mother
reign
but
his
wife
desiring
to
play
a
similar
rôle
to
that
enjoyed
by
her
poisoned
him
and
set
his
son
on
the
throne
this
monarch
who
was
weak
and
vicious
was
succeeded
by
who
introduced
reform
into
the
administration
and
encouraged
literature
and
learning
the
king
of
khokand
applied
for
aid
against
the
tibetans
and
arabs
and
sent
an
army
to
his
succour
but
his
general
was
completely
defeated
during
the
disorder
which
arose
in
consequence
of
the
invasion
of
the
northern
provinces
by
the
khitán
general
an
an
officer
of
turkish
descent
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
a
revolt
and
having
secured
on
the
yellow
river
advanced
on
thereupon
the
emperor
fled
and
placed
his
son
on
the
throne
this
sovereign
with
the
help
of
the
forces
of
khotan
khokand
and
bokhara
of
the
uighurs
and
of
some
arabs
sent
by
the
caliph
mansur
completely
defeated
an
during
the
following
reigns
the
tibetans
made
constant
incursions
into
the
western
provinces
of
the
empire
and
purchased
the
assistance
of
the
turks
against
those
intruders
by
giving
a
chinese
princess
as
wife
to
the
khan
at
this
epoch
the
eunuchs
of
the
palace
gained
an
unwonted
degree
of
power
and
several
of
the
subsequent
emperors
fell
victims
to
their
plots
the
dynasty
which
for
over
a
hundred
years
had
governed
firmly
and
for
the
good
of
the
nation
began
to
decline
the
history
of
the
and
centuries
is
for
the
most
part
a
monotonous
record
of
feeble
governments
oppressions
and
rebellions
almost
the
only
event
worth
chronicling
is
the
iconoclastic
policy
of
the
emperor
viewing
the
increase
of
monasteries
and
ecclesiastical
establishments
as
an
evil
he
abolished
all
temples
closed
the
monasteries
and
nunneries
and
sent
the
inmates
back
to
their
families
foreign
priests
were
subjected
to
the
same
repressive
legislation
and
christians
buddhists
and
magi
were
bidden
to
return
whence
they
came
buddhism
again
revived
during
the
reign
of
the
emperor
who
having
discovered
a
bone
of
buddha
brought
it
to
the
capital
in
great
state
by
internal
dissensions
the
empire
became
so
weakened
that
the
prince
of
liang
found
no
difficulty
in
gaining
possession
of
the
throne
he
took
the
title
of
being
the
first
emperor
of
the
later
liang
dynasty
thus
ended
the
dynasty
which
is
regarded
as
being
the
golden
age
of
chinese
literature
five
dynasties
viz
the
later
liang
the
later
the
later
tsin
the
later
han
and
the
later
chow
followed
each
other
between
the
years
and
though
the
monarchs
of
these
lines
nominally
held
sway
over
the
empire
their
real
power
was
confined
to
very
narrow
limits
the
disorders
which
were
rife
during
the
time
when
the
dynasty
was
tottering
to
its
fall
fostered
the
development
of
independent
states
and
so
arose
liang
in
and
ki
in
in
chow
in
and
parts
of
and
e
in
tsu
and
in
in
and
the
uighurs
in
tangut
sung
dynasty
a
partial
end
was
made
to
this
recognized
disorganization
when
in
general
chao
was
proclaimed
by
the
army
emperor
in
succession
to
the
youthful
who
was
compelled
to
abdicate
the
circumstances
of
the
time
justified
the
change
it
required
a
strong
hand
to
weld
the
empire
together
again
and
to
resist
the
attacks
of
the
khitán
tatars
whose
rule
at
this
period
extended
over
the
whole
of
manchuria
and
against
these
aggressive
neighbours
chao
directed
his
efforts
with
varying
success
and
he
died
in
while
the
war
was
still
being
waged
his
son
entered
on
the
campaign
with
energy
but
in
the
end
was
compelled
to
conclude
a
peace
with
the
khitán
his
successor
paid
them
tribute
to
abstain
from
further
incursions
probably
this
tribute
was
not
sent
regularly
at
all
events
under
the
khitán
again
threatened
to
invade
the
empire
and
were
only
bought
off
by
the
promise
of
an
annual
tribute
of
taels
of
silver
besides
a
great
quantity
of
silken
piece
goods
neither
was
this
arrangement
long
binding
and
so
formidable
were
the
advances
made
by
the
tatars
in
the
foilowing
reigns
that
invited
the
nüchih
tatars
to
expel
the
khitán
from
this
they
did
but
having
once
possessed
themselves
of
the
country
they
declined
to
yield
it
to
the
chinese
and
the
result
was
that
a
still
more
aggressive
neighbour
was
established
on
the
frontier
of
china
the
nüchih
or
kin
as
they
now
styled
themselves
overran
the
provinces
of
and
and
during
the
reign
of
they
advanced
their
conquests
to
the
line
of
the
from
this
time
the
sung
ruled
only
over
southern
china
while
the
kin
or
golden
dynasty
in
the
north
the
kin
made
which
occupied
in
part
the
site
of
the
modern
peking
their
usual
residence
the
sung
fixed
their
capital
at
nanking
and
afterwards
at
hangchow
between
them
and
the
kin
there
was
almost
constant
war
mongol
invasion
century
during
this
period
the
mongols
began
to
acquire
power
in
eastern
asia
and
about
the
beginning
of
the
century
the
forces
of
jenghiz
khan
invaded
the
frontier
of
china
and
the
principality
of
hia
which
at
that
time
consisted
of
the
modern
provinces
of
and
to
purchase
the
of
the
mongols
the
king
of
hia
agreed
to
pay
them
a
tribute
and
gave
a
princess
in
marriage
to
their
ruler
in
consequence
of
a
dispute
with
the
kin
emperor
wang
jenghiz
khan
determined
to
invade
he
was
aided
by
the
followers
of
the
khitán
leader
and
in
alliance
with
this
general
he
captured
the
capital
city
after
an
unsuccessful
invasion
of
china
in
jenghiz
khan
renewed
the
attack
in
he
divided
his
armies
into
four
divisions
and
made
a
general
advance
southwards
his
soldiers
swept
over
and
destroying
upwards
of
ninety
cities
it
was
their
boast
that
a
horseman
might
ride
without
stumbling
over
the
sites
where
those
cities
had
stood
the
emperor
moved
his
court
from
to
fu
much
against
the
advice
of
his
ministers
who
foresaw
the
disastrous
effect
this
retreat
would
have
on
the
fortunes
of
kin
the
state
of
sung
which
up
to
this
time
had
paid
tribute
now
declined
to
recognize
kin
as
its
feudal
chief
and
a
short
time
afterwards
declared
war
against
its
quondam
ally
meanwhile
in
advanced
into
china
by
the
kwan
and
made
himself
master
of
peking
one
of
the
few
cities
in
which
remained
to
kin
after
this
victory
his
nobles
wished
him
to
proclaim
himself
emperor
but
he
refused
being
mindful
of
an
oath
which
he
had
sworn
to
jenghiz
khan
in
a
mountain
pass
on
the
frontiers
of
and
and
the
scene
of
numerous
dynastic
battles
as
it
is
the
only
gateway
between
and
china
was
taken
by
the
invaders
as
the
war
dragged
on
the
resistance
offered
by
the
kin
grew
weaker
and
weaker
in
fu
the
capital
of
was
taken
and
five
years
later
jenghiz
khan
marched
an
army
westward
into
hia
and
conquered
the
forces
of
the
king
two
years
later
jenghiz
khan
died
with
the
view
to
the
complete
conquest
of
china
by
the
mongols
jenghiz
declined
to
nominate
either
of
the
eldest
two
sons
who
had
been
born
to
his
chinese
wives
as
his
heir
but
chose
his
third
son
ogdai
whose
mother
was
a
tatar
on
hearing
of
the
death
of
jenghiz
khan
the
kin
sent
an
embassy
to
his
successor
desiring
peace
but
ogdai
told
them
there
would
be
no
peace
for
them
until
their
dynasty
should
be
overthrown
hitherto
the
mongols
had
been
without
any
code
of
laws
but
the
consolidation
of
the
nation
by
the
conquests
of
jenghiz
khan
made
it
necessary
to
establish
a
recognized
code
of
laws
and
one
of
the
first
acts
of
ogdai
was
to
form
such
a
code
with
the
help
also
of
he
established
in
and
and
for
this
purpose
divided
these
provinces
into
ten
departments
meanwhile
the
war
with
the
kin
was
carried
on
with
energy
in
fu
was
taken
and
sixty
important
posts
were
captured
two
years
later
brother
of
ogdai
took
fu
and
fu
in
the
flight
from
which
place
persons
are
said
to
have
perished
following
the
course
of
the
river
han
in
his
victorious
career
this
general
destroyed
towns
and
fortresses
and
defeated
the
army
of
kin
at
mount
the
kin
dynasty
overthrown
in
the
mongols
made
an
alliance
with
the
state
of
sung
by
which
on
condition
of
sung
helping
to
destroy
kin
was
to
be
the
property
of
sung
for
ever
the
effect
of
this
coalition
soon
became
apparent
barely
had
the
kin
emperor
retreated
from
fu
to
fu
in
when
the
former
place
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
allies
next
fell
loyang
and
the
victorious
generals
then
marched
on
to
besiege
fu
the
presence
of
the
emperor
gave
energy
to
the
defenders
and
they
held
out
until
every
animal
in
the
city
had
been
killed
for
food
until
every
old
and
useless
person
had
suffered
death
to
lessen
the
number
of
hungry
mouths
until
so
many
men
had
fallen
that
the
women
manned
the
ramparts
and
then
the
allies
stormed
the
walls
the
emperor
burned
himself
to
death
in
his
palace
that
his
body
might
not
fall
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies
for
a
few
days
the
shadow
of
the
imperial
crown
rested
on
the
head
of
his
heir
but
in
a
tumult
which
broke
out
amongst
his
followers
he
lost
his
life
and
with
him
ended
the
golden
dynasty
notwithstanding
the
treaty
between
ogdai
and
sung
no
sooner
were
the
spoils
of
kin
to
be
divided
than
war
broke
out
again
between
them
in
prosecuting
which
the
mongol
armies
swept
over
the
provinces
of
and
and
were
checked
only
when
they
reached
the
walls
of
fu
in
ogdai
died
in
and
was
nominally
succeeded
by
his
grandson
cheliemên
but
one
of
his
widows
tolickona
took
possession
of
the
throne
and
after
exercising
rule
for
four
years
established
her
son
as
great
khan
in
his
life
was
cut
short
and
the
nobles
disregarding
the
claims
of
cheliemên
proclaimed
as
emperor
mangu
the
eldest
son
of
under
this
monarch
the
war
against
sung
was
carried
on
with
energy
and
kublai
outstripping
the
bounds
of
sung
territory
made
his
way
into
the
province
of
at
that
time
divided
into
a
number
of
independent
states
and
having
attached
them
to
his
brother
crown
he
passed
on
into
tibet
tongking
and
and
thence
striking
northwards
entered
the
province
of
kublai
khan
emperior
on
the
death
of
mangu
in
kublai
ascended
the
throne
never
in
the
history
of
china
was
the
nation
more
illustrious
nor
its
power
more
widely
felt
than
under
his
sovereignty
during
the
first
twenty
years
of
his
reign
sung
kept
up
a
resistance
against
his
authority
their
last
emperor
seeing
his
cause
lost
drowned
himself
in
the
sea
the
sung
dynasty
which
had
ruled
southern
china
years
despite
its
misfortunes
is
accounted
one
of
the
great
dynasties
of
china
during
its
sway
arts
and
literature
were
cultivated
and
many
eminent

flourished
his

subdued
kublai
khan
in
assumed
complete
jurisdiction
as
emperor
of
china
he
took
the
title
of
and
founded
what
is
known
as
the
yuen
dynasty
he
built
a
new
capital
close
to
which
became
known
as
kaanbaligh
city
of
the
khan
in
medieval
european
chronicles
cambaluc
and
later
as
peking
at
this
time
his
authority
was
acknowledged
from
the
frozen
sea
almost
to
the
straits
of
malacca
with
the
exception
of
hindustan
arabia
and
the
westernmost
parts
of
asia
all
the
mongol
princes
as
far
as
the
dnieper
declared
themselves
his
vassals
and
brought
regularly
their
tribute
it
was
during
this
reign
that
marco
polo
visited
china
and
he
describes
in
glowing
colours
the
virtues
and
glories
of
the
great
khan
his
rule
was
characterized
by
discretion
and
munificence
he
undertook
public
works
he
patronized
literature
and
relieved
the
distress
of
the
poor
but
the
chinese
never
forgot
that
he
was
an
alien
and
regarded
him
as
a
barbarian
he
died
unregretted
in
his
son
had
died
during
his
lifetime
and
after
some
contention
his
grandson
timur
ascended
the
throne
under
the
title
of
this
monarch
died
in
after
an
uneventful
reign
and
as
he
left
no
son
a
mongol
prince
became
emperor
to
him
succeeded
in
who
made
himself
conspicuous
by
the
honour
he
showed
to
the
memory
of
confucius
and
by
distributing
offices
more
equally
between
mongols
and
chinese
than
had
hitherto
been
done
this
act
of
justice
gave
great
satisfaction
to
the
chinese
and
his
death
ended
a
peaceful
and
prosperous
reign
in
at
this
time
there
appears
to
have
been
a
considerable
commercial
intercourse
between
europe
and
china
but
after
death
the
dynasty
fell
on
evil
days
the
mongols
in
adopting
chinese
civilization
had
lost
much
of
their
martial
spirit
they
were
still
regarded
as
alien
by
the
chinese
and
numerous
secret
societies
were
formed
to
achieve
their
overthrow
successors
were
weak
and
incapable
rulers
and
in
the
person
of
were
summed
up
the
vices
and
faults
of
his
predecessors
revolts
broke
out
and
finally
this
descendant
of
jenghiz
khan
was
compelled
to
fly
before
chu
the
son
of
a
chinese
labouring
man
deserted
by
his
followers
he
sought
refuge
in
fu
and
there
the
last
of
the
yüen
dynasty
died
these
mongol
emperors
whatever
their
faults
had
shown
tolerance
to
christian
missionaries
and
papal
legates
see
medieval
ming
dynasty
chu
met
with
little
opposition
more
especially
as
his
first
care
on
becoming
possessed
of
a
district
was
to
suppress
lawlessness
and
to
establish
a
settled
government
in
he
captured
nanking
and
proclaimed
himself
duke
of
wu
but
carefully
avoided
adopting
any
of
the
insignia
of
royalty
even
when
master
of
the
empire
thirteen
years
later
he
still
professed
to
dislike
the
idea
of
assuming
the
imperial
title
his
scruples
were
overcome
and
he
declared
himself
emperor
in
he
carried
his
arms
into
tatary
where
he
subdued
the
last
semblance
of
mongol
power
in
that
direction
and
then
bent
his
steps
towards
here
the
mongols
defended
themselves
with
the
bravery
of
despair
but
unavailingly
and
the
conquest
of
this
province
left
as
the
founder
of
the
new
or
ming
bright
dynasty
styled
himself
without
a
foe
in
the
empire
all
intercourse
with
europe
seems
now
to
have
ceased
until
the
portuguese
arrived
in
the
century
but
cultivated
friendly
relations
with
the
neighbouring
states
as
a
quondam
buddhist
priest
he
lent
his
countenance
to
that
religion
to
the
exclusion
of
taoism
whose
priests
had
for
centuries
earned
the
contempt
of
all
but
the
most
ignorant
by
their
pretended
magical
arts
and
their
search
after
the
philosopher
stone
died
in
and
was
succeeded
by
his
grandson
aware
that
the
appointment
of
this
youth
his
father
was
dead
would
give
offence
to
the
young
uncles

dismissed
them
to
their

laudatory
poem

subjugated

gurkhas
they
received
the
submission
of

his

were
not
so
successful
there

formosans
nor

over
the
loss
of

was
treated
as

tributary

macartney
was
received
with
every
courtesy
but
the
concessions

a
failure

broke
out
due
in
a
great
measure
to
the
carelessness
incompetency
and
obstinacy
of
the
emperor

the
coasts
were
infested
with
pirates
whose
number
and
organization
enabled
them
for
a
long
time
to
hold

in

condition
of

foreign
merchants
at
canton
had
not
improved

set
matters
on

he
declined
to

proved
abortive
destitute
of

royal
qualities
a
slave
to
his
passions
and
the
servant
of
caprice
died
in
the
event
fraught
with
the
greatest
consequences
to
china
which
occurred
in
his
reign
though
at
the
time
it
attracted
little
attention

reached

in
his
early
years
of
considerable
energy

no

than
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
pursuit

reforms
which
his

manifestoes
foreshadowed

seriously
occupied
his
attention

became

with

more
important
to
the
future
of
the
country
than
the
internal
disturbances
was
the
new
attitude
taken
at
this
time
towards
china
by
the
nations
of
europe
hitherto
the
european
missionaries
and
traders
in
china
had
been
dependent
upon
the
goodwill
of
the
chinese
the
portuguese
had
been
allowed
to
settle
at
macao
for
some
centuries
roman
catholic
missionaries
since
the
time
of
ricci
had
been
alternately
patronized
and
persecuted
protestant
missionaries
had
scarcely
gained
a
foothold
the
europeans
allowed
to
trade
at
canton
continued
to
suffer
under
vexatious
regulations
the
chinese
in
general
regarded
europeans
as
barbarians
foreign
devils
of
the
armed
strength
of
europe
they
were
ignorant
they
were
now
to
be
undeceived
great
britain
being
the
first
power
to
take
action
the
hardships
inflicted
on
the
british
merchants
at
canton
became
so
unbearable
that
when
in
the
monopoly
of
the
east
india
company
ceased
the
british
government
sent
lord
napier
as
minister
to
superintend
the
foreign
trade
at
that
port
lord
napier
was
inadequately
supported
and
the
anxieties
of
his
position
brought
on
an
attack
of
fever
from
which
he
died
at
macao
after
a
few
months
residence
in
china
the
chief
cause
of
complaint
adduced
by
the
mandarins
was
the
introduction
of
opium
by
the
merchants
and
for
years
they
attempted
by
every
means
in
their
power
to
put
a
stop
to
its
importation

the
legendary
progenitor
of

his
adoption
and
proclamation
as
emperor
under
the
title
of

of
glory
imperial
family
nomenclature
and
rank
in
order
to
prevent
the
confusion
which
would
arise
among
the
princes
of
the
imperial
house
were
they
each
to
adopt
an
arbitrary
name
the
emperor
decreed
that
each
of
his
sons
should
have
a
name
consisting
of
two
characters
the
first
of
which
should
be
and
the
second
should
be
compounded
with
the
determinative
to
manifest
an
arrangement
which
would
as
has
been
remarked
find
an
exact
parallel
in
a
system
by
which
the
sons
in
an
english
family
might
be
called
louis
louis
louis
louis
and
so
on
this
device
obtained
also
in
the
next
generation
all
the
princes
of
which
had
for
their
first
name
and
the
emperor
extended
it
into
a
system
and
directed
that
the
succeeding
generations
should
take
the
four
characters
and
respectively
as
the
first
part
of
their
names
eight
other
characters
namely
were
subsequently
added
thus
providing
generic
names
for
twelve
generations
with
the
generation
represented
by
the
first
four
characters
were
exhausted
and
any
sons
of
the
emperor
would
therefore
have
been
called
by
the
ceremonial
law
of
the
great
pure
dynasty
twelve
degrees
of
rank
are
distributed
among
the
princes
of
the

so
on

to
the

the
accession
to
the

of

attracted
little
notice
outside
china

to

vested
in

principal
wife
of
the
emperor

wife
of

of

yet
there
were
circumstances
connected
with
the
emperor
accession
which
might
well
have
arrested
attention
the
emperor
who
had
himself
succumbed
to
an
ominously
brief
and
mysterious
illness

a
young
widow
in
an
advanced
state
of
pregnancy

she
given
birth
to
a

child
her
son

have
been
the
rightful
heir
to

she
sickened
and

of
grief
it

officially
stated
at
the
loss
of
her
imperial
spouse

solved
the
question
of
the
succession
by
placing
on
the
throne
a
measure
which
was
not
only
in
itself
arbitrary
but
also
in
direct
conflict
with
one
of
the
most
sacred
of
chinese
traditions
the
solemn
rites
of
incumbent
on
every
chinaman
and
above
all
upon
the
emperor
can
only
be
properly
performed
by
a
member
of
a
younger
generation

those
whom
it
is
his
duty
to
honour
the
emperor

now
called
upon

china
being
in
a
position
to
maintain

china
despatched
a
manchu
of
the
highest
rank
who
had
been
notoriously
concerned
in
the
tientsin
massacre
of
to
st
petersburg
to
negotiate
a
settlement
after
some
months
of
discussion
a
document
was
signed
september
termed
the
treaty
of
livadia
whereby
china
recovered
not
indeed
the
whole
but
a
considerable
portion
of
the
territory
on
her
paying
to
russia
five
million
roubles
as
the
cost
of
occupation
the
treaty
was
however
received
with
a
storm
of
indignation
in
china
memorials
poured
in
from
all
sides
denouncing
the
treaty
and
its
author
foremost
among
these
was
one
by
chang
who
afterwards
became
the
most
distinguished
of
the
viceroys
and
of
and
provinces
prince
chun
the
emperor
father
came
into
prominence
at
this
juncture
as
an
advocate
for
war
and
under
these
combined
influences
the
unfortunate
was
tried
and
condemned
to
death
of
march
for
some
months
warlike
preparations
went
on
and
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
was
imminent
in
the
end
however
calmer
counsels
prevailed
it
was
decided
to
send
the
marquis
tseng
who
in
the
meantime
had
become
minister
in
london
to
russia
to
negotiate
a
new
treaty
which
still
left
russia
in
possession
of
part
of
the
ili
valley
was
ratified
on
the
of
august
the
chinese
government
could
now
contemplate
the
almost
complete
recovery
of
the
whole
extensive
dominions
which
had
at
any
time
owned
the
imperial
sway
the
regions
directly
administered
by
the
officers
of
the
emperor
extended
from
the
borders
of
siberia
on
the
north
to
annam
and
burma
on
the
south
and
from
the
pacific
ocean
on
the
east
to
kashgar
and
yarkand
on
the
west
there
was
also
a
fringe
of
tributary
nations
which
still
kept
up
the
ancient
forms
of
allegiance
and
which
more
or
less
acknowledged
the
dominioi
of
the
central
kingdom
the
principal
tributary
nations
then
were
korea
annam
burma
and
nepal
korea
and
japan
korea
was
the
first
of
the
dependencies
to
come
into
notice
in
some
roman
catholic
missionaries
were
murdered
and
about
the
same
time
an
american
vessel
was
burnt
in
one
of
the
rivers
and
her
crew
murdered
china
refused
satisfaction
both
to
france
and
america
and
suffered
reprisals
to
be
made
on
korea
without
protest
america
and
japan
both
desired
to
conclude
commercial
treaties
for
the
opening
up
of
korea
and
proposed
to
negotiate
with
china
china
refused
and
referred
them
to
the
korean
government
direct
saying
she
was
not
wont
to
interfere
in
the
affairs
of
her
vassal
states
as
a
result
japan
concluded
a
treaty
in
in
which
the
independence
of
korea
was
expressly
recognized
this
was
allowed
to
pass
without
protest
but
as
other
nations
proceeded
to
conclude
treaties
on
the
same
terms
china
began
to
perceive
her
mistake
and
endeavoured
to
tack
on
to
each
a
declaration
by
the
king
that
he
was
in
fact
a
tributary
a
declaration
however
which
was
quietly
ignored
japan
however
was
the
only
power
with
which
controversy
immediately
arose
in
a
faction
fight
which
had
long
been
smouldering
broke
out
headed
by
the
king
father
the
tai
won
kun
in
the
course
of
which
the
japanese
legation
was
attacked
and
the
whole
japanese
colony
had
to
flee
for
their
lives
china
sent
troops
and
by
adroitly
kidnapping
the
tai
won
kun
order
was
for
a
time
restored
the
japanese
legation
was
replaced
but
under
the
protection
of
a
strong
body
of
japanese
troops
further
revolutions
and
riots
followed
in
which
the
troops
of
the
two
countries
took
sides
and
there
was
imminent
danger
of
war
to
obviate
this
risk
it
was
agreed
in
between
count
ito
and
li
that
both
sides
should
withdraw
their
troops
the
king
being
advised
to
engage
officers
of
a
third
state
to
put
his
army
on
such
a
footing
as
would
maintain
order
and
each
undertook
to
give
the
other
notice
should
it
be
found
necessary
to
send
troops
again
in
this
way
a
was
established
which
lasted
till
domestic
affairs
we
can
only
glance
briefly
at
the
domestic
affairs
of
china
during
the
period
the
years
were
marked
by
a
famine
in
and
which
for
duration
and
intensity
has
probably
never
been
equalled
it
was
computed
that
or
millions
perished
it
was
vainly
hoped
that
this
loss
of
life
due
mainly
to
defective
commumcations
would
induce
the
chinese
government
to
listen
to
proposals
for
railway
construction
the
russian
scare
had
however
taught
the
chinese
the
value
of
telegraphs
and
in
the
first
line
was
laid
from
tientsin
to
shanghai
further
construction
was
continued
without
intermission
from
this
date
a
beginning
also
was
made
in
naval
affairs
the
arsenal
at
fuchow
was
turning
out
small
composite
gunboats
a
training
ship
was
bought
and
put
under
the
command
of
a
british
officer
several
armoured
cruisers
were
ordered
from
england
and
some
progress
was
made
with
the
fortifications
of
port
arthur
and
forts
were
also
built
and
guns
mounted
at
fuchow
shanghai
canton
and
other
vulnerable
points
money
for
these
purposes
was
abundantly
supplied
by
the
customs
duties
on
foreign
trade
and
china
had
learnt
that
at
need
she
could
borrow
from
the
foreign
banks
on
the
security
of
this
revenue
in
the
senior
regent
the
empress
an
was
carried
off
by
a
sudden
attack
of
heart
disease
and
the
empress
hsi
remained
in
undivided
possession
of
the
supreme
power
during
the
remainder
of
the
emperor
minority
li
firmly
established
at
tientsin
within
easy
reach
of
the
capital
as
viceroy
of
the
home
province
of
and
superintendent
of
northern
trade
enjoyed
a
larger
share
of
his
imperial
mistress
favour
than
was
often
granted
by
the
ruling
manchus
to
officials
of
chinese
birth
and
in
all
the
graver
questions
of
foreign
policy
his
advice
was
generally
decisive
tongking
and
hanoi
while
the
dispute
with
japan
was
still
going
on
regarding
korea
china
found
herself
involved
in
a
more
serious
quarrel
in
respect
of
another
tributary
state
which
lay
on
the
southern
frontier
by
a
treaty
made
between
france
and
annam
in
the
red
river
or
songkoi
which
rising
china
flows
through
tongking
was
opened
to
trade
together
with
the
cities
of
haiphong
and
hanoi
situated
on
the
delta
the
object
of
the
french
was
to
find
a
trade
route
to
and
from
a
base
of
their
own
and
it
was
hoped
the
red
river
would
furnish
such
a
route
tongking
at
this
time
however
was
infested
with
bands
of
pirates
and
many
of
whom
were
chinese
rebels
or
who
had
been
driven
across
the
frontier
by
the
suppression
of
the
and
taiping
rebellions
conspicuous
among
them
being
an
organization
called
the
black
flags
and
when
in
france
sent
troops
to
tongking
to
restore
order
the
annamese
government
having
failed
to
fulfil
its
promises
in
that
respect
china
began
to
protest
claiming
that
annam
was
a
vassal
state
and
under
her
protection
troubles
with
france
france
took
no
notice
of
the
protest
declaring
that
the
claim
had
merely
an
archaeological
interest
and
that
in
any
case
china
in
military
affairs
was
a
france
found
however
that
she
had
undertaken
a
very
serious
task
in
trying
to
put
down
the
forces
of
disorder
see
tongking
the
black
flags
were
it
was
believed
being
aided
by
money
and
arms
from
china
and
as
time
went
on
the
french
were
more
and
more
being
confronted
with
regular
chinese
soldiers
several
forts
well
within
the
tongking
frontier
were
known
to
be
garrisoned
by
chinese
troops
operations
continued
with
more
or
less
success
during
the
winter
and
spring
of
both
sides
however
were
desirous
of
an
arrangement
and
in
may
a
convention
was
signed
between
li
and
a
captain
fournier
who
had
been
commissioned
whereby
china
agreed
to
withdraw
her
garrisons
and
to
open
her
frontiers
to
trade
france
agreeing
on
her
part
to
respect
the
fiction
of
chinese
suzerainty
and
guarantee
the
frontier
from
attack
by
brigands
no
date
had
been
fixed
in
the
convention
for
the
evacuation
of
the
chinese
garrisons
and
fournier
endeavoured
to
supplement
this
by
a
memorandum
to
li
at
the
same
time
announcing
the
fact
to
his
government
in
pursuance
of
this
arrangement
the
french
troops
proceeded
to
occupy
langson
on
the
date
fixed
june
the
chinese
commandant
refused
to
evacuate
alleging
in
a
despatch
which
no
one
in
the
french
camp
was
competent
to
translate
that
he
had
received
no
orders
and
begged
for
a
short
delay
to
enable
him
to
communicate
with
his
superiors
the
french
commandant
ordered
an
attack
which
was
repulsed
with
severe
loss
mutual
recriminations
ensued
from
paris
there
came
a
demand
for
a
huge
indemnity
as
reparation
for
the
insult
the
peking
government
offered
to
carry
out
the
convention
and
to
pay
a
small
indemnity
for
the
lives
lost
through
the
misunderstanding
this
was
refused
and
hostilities
recommenced
or
as
the
french
preferred
to
call
them
reprisals
for
the
fiction
was
still
kept
up
that
the
two
countries
were
not
at
war
under
cover
of
this
fiction
the
french
fleet
peaceably
entered
the
harbour
of
fuchow
having
passed
the
forts
at
the
entrance
to
the
river
without
hindrance
once
inside
they
attacked
and
destroyed
the
much
inferior
chinese
fleet
which
was
then
quietly
at
anchor
destroying
at
the
same
time
a
large
part
of
the
arsenal
which
adjoins
the
anchorage
august
retracing
its
steps
the
french
fleet
attacked
and
destroyed
with
impunity
the
forts
which
were
built
to
guard
the
entrance
to
the
min
river
and
could
offer
no
resistance
to
a
force
coming
from
the
rear
after
this
exploit
the
french
fleet
left
the
mainland
and
continued
its
reprisals
on
the
coast
of
formosa
kelung
a
treaty
port
was
bombarded
and
taken
october
a
similar
attempt
however
on
the
neighbouring
port
of
tamsui
was
unsuccessful
the
landing
party
having
been
driven
back
to
their
ships
with
severe
loss
the
attempt
was
not
renewed
and
the
fleet
thereafter
confined
itself
to
a
of
the
island
which
was
prolonged
into
but
led
to
no
practical
results
negotiations
for
peace
however
which
had
been
for
some
time
in
progress
through
the
mediation
of
sir
robert
hart
were
at
this
juncture
happily
concluded
april
the
terms
were
practically
those
of
the
fournier
convention
of
the
year
before
the
demand
for
an
indemnity
having
been
quietly
dropped
increased
prestige
of
china
china
on
the
whole
came
out
of
the
struggle
with
greatly
increased
prestige
she
had
tried
conclusions
with
a
european
power
and
had
held
her
own
incorrect
conclusions
as
to
the
military
strength
of
china
were
consequently
drawn
not
merely
by
the
chinese
themselves
which
was
excusable
but
by
european
and
even
british
authorities
who
ought
to
have
been
better
informed
war
vessels
were
ordered
by
china
both
from
england
and
germany
and
admiral
lang
who
had
withdrawn
his
services
while
the
war
was
going
on
was
together
with
a
number
of
british
officers
and
instructors
the
completion
of
the
works
at
port
arthur
was
taken
in
hand
and
a
beginning
was
made
in
the
construction
of
forts
at
as
a
second
naval
base
a
new
department
was
created
for
the
control
of
naval
affairs
at
the
head
of
which
was
placed
prince
chun
father
of
the
emperor

since
the
downfall
of
prince

in
had
been
taking
a
more
and
more
prominent
part
in
public
affairs
from
to
the
political
history
of
china
does
not
call
for
extended
notice
two
incidents
however
must
be
recorded
the
conclusion
in
of
a
convention
with
great
britain
in
which
the
chinese
government
undertook
to
recognize
british
sovereignty
in
burma
and
the
temporary
occupation
of
port
hamilton
by
the
british
fleet
may
in
admiral
lang
resigned
his
command
of
the
chinese
fleet
during
a
temporary
absence
of
lang
colleague
admiral
ting
the
chinese
second
in
command
claimed
the
right
to
take
charge
a
claim
which
admiral
lang
naturally
resented
the
question
was
referred
to
li
who
decided
against
lang
whereupon
the
latter
threw
up
his
commission
from
this
point
the
fleet
on
which
so
much
depended
began
to
deteriorate
superior
officers
again
began
to
steal
the
men
pays
the
ships
were
starved
shells
filled
with
charcoal
instead
of
powder
were
supplied
accounts
were
cooked
and
all
the
corruption
and
malfeasance
that
were
rampant
in
the
army
crept
back
into
the
navy
war
with
japan
european
intervention
the
year
witnessed
the
outbreak
of
the
war
with
japan
in
the
spring
complications
again
arose
with
japan
over
korea
and
hostilities
began
in
july
the
story
of
the
war
is
told
elsewhere
see
war
and
it
is
unnecessary
here
to
recount
the
details
of
the
decisive
victory
of
japan
a
new
power
had
arisen
in
the
far
east
and
when
peace
was
signed
by
li
at
shimonoseki
on
the
of
april
it
meant
the
beginning
of
a
new
epoch
the
terms
included
the
cession
of
peninsula
then
in
actual
occupation
by
the
japanese
troops
the
cession
of
formosa
an
indemnity
of
taels
about
and
various
commercial
privileges
the
signature
of
this
treaty
brought
the
european
powers
on
the
scene
it
had
been
for
some
time
the
avowed
ambition
of
russia
to
obtain
an
port
as
an
outlet
to
her
siberian
possessions
an
ambition
which
was
considered
by
british
statesmen
as
not
unreasonable
it
did
not
therefore
at
all
suit
her
purposes
to
see
the
rising
power
of
japan
commanding
the
whole
of
the
of
korea
accordingly
in
the
interval
between
the
signature
and
the
ratification
of
the
treaty
invitations
were
addressed
by
russia
to
the
great
powers
to
intervene
with
a
view
to
its
modification
on
the
ground
of
the
disturbance
of
the
balance
of
power
and
the
menace
to
china
which
the
occupation
of
port
arthur
by
the
japanese
would
involve
france
and
germany
accepted
the
invitation
great
britain
declined
in
the
end
the
three
powers
brought
such
pressure
to
bear
on
japan
that
she
gave
up
the
whole
of
her
continental
acquisitions
retaining
only
the
island
of
formosa
the
indemnity
was
on
the
other
hand
increased
by
taels
for
the
time
the
integrity
of
china
seemed
to
be
preserved
and
russia
france
and
germany
could
pose
as
her
friends
evidence
was
however
soon
forthcoming
that
russia
and
france
had
not
been
disinterested
in
rescuing
chinese
territory
from
the
japanese
grasp
russia
now
obtained
the
right
to
carry
the
siberian
railway
across
chinese
territory
from
stryetensk
to
vladivostok
thus
avoiding
a
long
détour
besides
giving
a
grasp
on
northern
manchuria
france
obtained
by
a
convention
dated
the
of
june
a
rectification
of
frontier
in
the
mekong
valley
and
certain
railway
and
mining
rights
in
and
both
powers
obtained
concessions
of
land
at
hankow
for
the
purposes
of
a
settlement
russia
was
also
said
to
have
negotiated
a
secret
treaty
frequently
described
as
the
cassini
convention
but
more
probably
signed
by
li
at
moscow
giving
her
the
right
in
certain
contingencies
to
port
arthur
which
was
to
be
refortified
with
russian
assistance
and
by
way
of
further
securing
her
hold

guaranteed
a
loan

dispute
the
convention
between
france
and
china
of
the
of
june
brought
china
into
sharp
conflict
with
great
britain
china
having
by
the
burma
convention
of
agreed
to
recognize
british
sovereignty
over
burma
her
quondam
feudatory
also
agreed
to
a
delimitation
of
boundaries
at
the
proper
time
effect
was
given
to
this
last
stipulation
by
a
subsequent
convention
concluded
in
london
of
march
which
traced
the
boundary

from
the
shan
states
on
the
west
as
far
as
the
mekong
river
on
the
east
in
the

valley
there
were
two
native
territories
over
which
suzerainty
had
been
claimed
in
times
gone
by
both
by
the
kings
of
ava
and
by
the
chinese
emperors
these
territories
were
named

territory
the
boundary
line
was
so
drawn
as
to
leave
both
these
territories
to
china
but
it
was
stipulated
that
china
should
not
alienate
any
portion
of
these
territories
to
any
other
power
without
the
previous
consent
of
great
britain
yielding
to
french
pressure
and
regardless
of
the
undertaking
she
had
entered
into
with
great
britain
china
in
the
convention
with
france
in
june
so
drew
the
boundary
line
as
to
cede
to
france
that
portion
of
the
territory
of
kiang
hung
which
lay
on
the
left
bank
of
the
mekong
compensation
was
demanded
by
great
britain
from
china
for
this
breach
of
faith
and
at
the
same
time
negotiations
were
entered
into
with
france
these
resulted
in
a
joint
declaration
by
the
governments
of
france
and
great
britain
dated
the
of
january
by
which
it
was
agreed
as
regards
boundary
that
the
mekong
from
the
point
of
its
confluence
with
the
nam
huk
northwards
as
far
as
the
chinese
frontier
should
be
the
dividing
line
between
the
possessions
or
spheres
of
influence
of
the
two
powers
it
was
also
agreed
that
any
commercial
privileges
obtained
by
either
power
in
or
should
be
open
to
the
subjects
of
the
other
the
negotiations
with
china
resulted
in
a
further
agreement
dated
the
of
february
whereby
considerable
modifications
in
favour
of
great
britain
were
made
in
the
burma
boundary
drawn
by
the
convention
kiaochow
port
arthur
while
russia
and
france
were
profiting
by
what
they
were
pleased
to
call
the
generosity
of
china
germany
alone
had
so
far
received
no
reward
for
her
share
in
compelling
the
retrocession
of
but
in
november
she
proceeded
to
help
herself
by
seizing
the
bay
of
kiaochow
in
the
province
of
the
act
was
done
ostensibly
in
order
to
compel
satisfaction
for
the
murder
of
two
german
missionaries
a
cession
was
ultimately
made
by
way
of
a
lease
for
a
term
of
years
germany
to
have
full
territorial
jurisdiction
during
the
continuance
of
the
lease
with
liberty
to
erect
fortifications
build
docks
and
exercise
all
the
rights
of
sovereignty
in
december
the
russian
fleet
was
sent
to
winter
in
port
arthur
and
though
this
was
at
first
described
as
a
temporary
measure
its
object
was
speedily
disclosed
by
a
request
made
in
january
by
the
russian
ambassador
in
london
that
two
british
cruisers
then
also
anchored
at
port
arthur
should
be
withdrawn
in
order
to
avoid
friction
in
the
russian
sphere
of
influence
they
left
shortly
afterwards
and
their
departure
in
the
circumstances
was
regarded
as
a
blow
to
great
britain
prestige
in
the
far
east
in
march
the
russian
government
peremptorily
demanded
a
lease
of
port
arthur
and
the
adjoining
anchorage
of
talienwan
a
demand
which
china
could
not
resist
without
foreign
support
after
an
acrimonious
correspondence
with
the
russian
government
great
britain
acquiesced
in
the
the
russian
occupation
of
port
arthur
was
immediately
followed
by
a
concession
to
build
a
line
of
railway
from
that
point
northwards
to
connect
with
the
siberian
trunk
line
in
north
manchuria
as
a
counterpoise
to
the
growth
of
russian
influence
in
the
north
great
britain
obtained
a
lease
of
and
formally
took
possession
of
it
on
its
evacuation
by
the
japanese
troops
in
may
open
door
and
spheres
of
influence
after
much
hesitation
the
chinese
government
had
at
last
resolved
to
permit
the
construction
of
railways
with
foreign
capital
an
influential
official
named
sheng
was
appointed
of
railways
and
empowered
to
enter
into
negotiations
with
foreign
capitalists
for
that
purpose
a
keen
competition
thereupon
ensued
between
syndicates
of
different
nationalities
and
their
claims
being
espoused
by
their
various
governments
an
equally
keen
international
rivalry
was
set
up
great
britain
though
intimating
her
preference
for
the
open
door
policy
meaning
equal
opportunity
for
all
yet
found
herself
compelled
to
fall
in
with
the
general
movement
towards
what
became
known
as
the
spheres
of
influence
policy
and
claimed
the
yangtsze
valley
as
her
particular
sphere
this
she
did
by
the
somewhat
negative
method
of
obtaining
from
the
chinese
government
a
declaration
that
no
part
of
the
yangtsze
valley
should
be
alienated
to
any
foreign
power
a
more
formal
recognition
of
the
claim
as
far
as
railway
enterprise
was
concerned
was
embodied
in
an
agreement
of
april
between
great
britain
and
russia
and
communicated
to
the
chinese
government
whereby
the
russian
government
agreed
not
to
seek
for
any
concessions
within
the
yangtsze
valley
including
all
the
provinces
bordering
on
the
great
river
together
with
and
the
british
government
entering
into
a
similar
undertaking
in
regard
to
the
chinese
dominions
north
of
the
great
wall
in
talienwan
and
kiaochow
were
respectively
thrown
open
by
russia
and
germany
to
foreign
trade
and
encouraged
by
these
measures
the
united
states
government
initiated
in
september
of
the
same
year
a
correspondence
with
the
great
european
powers
and
japan
with
a
view
to
securing
their
definite
adhesion
to
the
open
door
policy
the
british
government
gave
an
unqualified
approval
to
the
american
proposal
and
the
replies
of
the
other
powers
though
more
guarded
were
accepted
at
washington
as
satisfactory
a
further
and
more
definite
step
towards
securing
the
maintenance
of
the
open
door
in
china
was
the
agreement
concluded
in
october
between
the
british
and
german
governments
the
signatories
by
the
first
two
articles
agreed
to
endeavour
to
keep
the
ports
on
the
rivers
and
littoral
free
and
open
to
international
trade
and
economic
activity
and
to
uphold
this
rule
for
all
chinese
territory
as
far
as
in
the
german
counterpart
they
could
exercise
influence
not
to
use
the
existing
complications
to
obtain
territorial
advantages
in
chinese
dominions
and
to
seek
to
maintain
undiminished
the
territorial
condition
of
the
chinese
empire
by
a
third
article
they
reserved
their
right
to
come
to
a
preliminary
understanding
for
the
protection
of
their
interests
in
china
should
any
other
power
use
those
complications
to
obtain
such
territorial
advantages
under
any
form
whatever
on
the
submission
of
the
agreement
to
the
powers
interested
austria
france
italy
and
japan
accepted
its
principles
without
express
reservation
japan
first
obtaining
assurances
that
she
signed
on
the
same
footing
as
an
original
signatory
the
united
states
accepted
the
first
two
articles
but
expressed
no
opinion
on
the
third
russia
construed
the
first
as
limited
to
ports
actually
open
in
regions
where
the
two
signatories
exercise
their
influence
and
favourably
entertained
it
in
that
sense
ignoring
the
reference
to
other
forms
of
economic
activity
she
fully
accepted
the
second
and
observed
that
in
the
contingency
contemplated
by
the
third
she
would
modify
her
attitude
according
to
circumstances
meanwhile
negotiations
carried
on
by
the
british
minister
at
peking
during
resulted
in
the
grant
of
very
important
privileges
to
foreign
commerce
the
payment
of
the
second
instalment
of
the
japanese
indemnity
was
becoming
due
and
it
was
much
discussed
how
and
on
what
terms
china
would
be
able
to
raise
the
amount
the
russian
government
as
has
been
stated
had
made
china
a
loan
of
the
sum
required
for
the
first
portion
of
the
indemnity
viz
taking
a
charge
on
the
customs
revenue
as
security
the
british
government
was
urged
to
make
a
like
loan
of
both
as
a
matter
of
friendship
to
china
and
as
a
counterpoise
to
the
russian
influence
an
arrangement
was
come
to
accordingly
on
very
favourable
terms
financially
to
the
chinese
but
at
the
last
moment
they
drew
back
being
overawed
as
they
said
by
the
threatening
attitude
of
russia
taking
advantage
of
the
position
which
this
refusal
gave
him
the
british
minister
obtained
from
the
besides
the
declaration
as
to
the
of
the
yangtsze
valley
above
mentioned
an
undertaking
to
throw
the
whole
of
the
inland
waterways
open
to
steam
traffic
the
chinese
government
at
the
same
time
undertook
that
the
post
of
of
customs
then
held
by
sir
robert
hart
should
always
be
held
by
an
englishman
so
long
as
the
trade
of
great
britain
was
greater
than
that
of
any
other
nation
minor
concessions
were
also
made
but
the
opening
of
the
waterways
was
by
far
the
greatest
advance
that
had
been
made
since
of
still
greater
importance
were
the
railway
and
mining
concessions
granted
during
the
same
year
the
chinese
government
had
been
generally
disposed
to
railway
construction
since
the
conclusion
of
the
japanese
war
but
hoped
to
be
able
to
retain
the
control
in
their
own
hands
the
masterful
methods
of
russia
and
germany
had
obliged
them
to
surrender
this
control
so
far
as
concerned
manchuria
and
in
the
yangtsze
valley
sheng
the
of
railways
had
been
negotiating
with
several
competing
syndicates
one
of
these
was
a
syndicate
which
was
endeavouring
to
obtain
the
trunk
line
from
hankow
to
peking
a
british
company
was
tendering
for
the
same
work
and
as
the
line
lay
mainly
within
the
british
sphere
it
was
considered
not
unreasonable
to
expect
it
should
be
given
to
the
latter
at
a
critical
moment
however
the
french
and
russian
ministers
intervened
and
practically
forced
the
yamen
to
grant
a
contract
in
favour
of
the
company
the
yamen
had
a
few
days
before
explicitly
promised
the
british
minister
that
the
contract
should
not
be
ratified
without
his
having
an
opportunity
of
seeing
it
as
a
penalty
for
this
breach
of
faith
and
as
a
to
the
line
the
british
minister
required
the
immediate
grant
of
all
the
railway
concessions
for
which
british
syndicates
were
then
negotiating
and
on
terms
not
inferior
to
those
granted
to
the
belgian
line
in
this
way
all
the
lines
in
the
lower
yangtsze
as
also
the
mining
companies
lines
were
secured
a
contract
for
a
trunk
line
from
canton
to
hankow
was
negotiated
in
the
latter
part
of
by
an
american
company
the
reform
movement
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
powers
engrossed
in
the
diplomatic
conflicts
of
which
peking
was
the
centre
had
entirely
underrated
the
reactionary
forces
gradually
mustering
for
a
struggle
against
the
aggressive
spirit
of
western
civilization
the
lamentable
consequences
of
administrative
corruption
and
incompetence
and
the
superiority
of
foreign
methods
which
had
been
amply
illustrated
by
the
japanese
war
had
at
first
produced
a
considerable
impression
not
only
upon
the
more
enlightened
commercial
classes
but
even
upon
many
of
the
younger
members
of
the
official
classes
in
china
the
who
in
spite
of
the
emperor
having
nominally
attained
his
majority
had
retained
practical
control
of
the
supreme
power
until
the
conflict
with
japan
had
been
held
not
unjustly
to
blame
for
the
disasters
of
the
war
and
even
before
its
conclusion
the
young
emperor
was
adjured
by
some
of
the
most
responsible
among
his
own
subjects
to
shake
himself
free
from
the
baneful
restraint
of
petticoat
government
and
himself
take
the
helm
in
the
following
years
a
reform
movement
undoubtedly
genuine
though
opinions
differ
as
to
the
value
of
the
popular
support
which
it
claimed
spread
throughout
the
central
and
southern
provinces
of
the
empire
one
of
the
most
significant
symptoms
was
the
relatively
large
demand
which
suddenly
arose
for
the
translations
of
foreign
works
and
similar
publications
in
the
chinese
language
which
philanthropic
societies
such
as
that
for
the
diffusion
of
christian
and
general
knowledge
amongst
the
chinese
had
been
trying
for
some
time
past
to
popularize
though
hitherto
with
scant
success
chinese
newspapers
published
in
the
treaty
ports
spread
the
ferment
of
new
ideas
far
into
the
interior
fifteen
hundred
young
men
of
good
family
applied
to
enter
the
foreign
university
at
peking
and
in
some
of
the
provincial
towns
the
chinese
themselves
subscribed
towards
the
opening
of
foreign
schools
reform
societies
which
not
infrequently
enjoyed
official
countenance
sprang
up
in
many
of
the
large
towns
and
found
numerous
adherents
amongst
the
younger
early
in
the
emperor
who
had
gradually
emancipated
himself
from
the
control
summoned
several
of
the
reform
leaders
to
peking
and
requested
their
advice
with
regard
to
the
progressive
measures
which
should
be
introduced
into
the
government
of
the
empire
chief
amongst
these
reformers
was
kang
a
cantonese
whose
scholarly
attainments
combined
with
novel
teachings
earned
for
him
from
his
followers
the
title
of
the
modern
sage
of
his
more
or
less
active
sympathizers
who
had
subsequently
to
suffer
with
him
in
the
cause
of
reform
the
most
prominent
were
chang
a
member
of
the
grand
council
and
of
the
who
had
represented
his
sovereign
at
queen
jubilee
in
chin
governor
of
liang
chichao
the
editor
of
the
reformers
organ
su
chiching
a
reader
of
the
hanlin
college
the
educational
stronghold
of
chinese
conservatism
and
his
son
su
also
a
hanlin
man
and
provincial
chancellor
of
public
instruction
in
it
soon
became
evident
that
there
was
no
more
enthusiastic
advocate
of
the
new
ideas
than
the
emperor
himself
within
a
few
months
the
vermilion
pencil
gave
the
imperial
sanction
to
a
succession
of
edicts
which
had
they
been
carried
into
effect
would
have
amounted
to
a
revolution
as
as
that
which
had
transformed
japan
thirty
years
previously
the
fossilized
system
of
examinations
for
the
public
service
was
to
be
altogether
superseded
by
a
new
schedule
based
on
foreign
learning
for
the
better
promotion
of
which
a
number
of
temples
were
to
be
converted
into
schools
for
western
education
a
state
department
was
to
be
created
for
the
translation
and
dissemination
of
the
standard
works
of
western
literature
and
science
even
the
scions
of
the
ruling
manchu
race
were
to
be
compelled
to
study
foreign
languages
and
travel
abroad
and
last
but
not
least
all
useless
offices
both
in
peking
and
in
the
provinces
were
to
be
abolished
a
further
edict
was
even
reported
to
be
in
contemplation
doing
away
with
the
or
pigtail
which
originally
imposed
upon
the
chinese
by
their
manchu
conquerors
as
a
badge
of
subjection
had
gradually
become
the
most
characteristic
and
most
cherished
feature
of
the
national
dress
but
the
bureaucracy
of
china
which
had
battened
for
centuries
on
corruption
and
ignorance
had
no
taste
for
other
vested
interests
felt
themselves
equally
threatened
and
behind
them
stood
the
whole
latent
force
of
popular
superstition
and
unreasoning
conservatism
the
empress
coup
the
saw
her
opportunity
the
summer
palace
to
which
she
had
retired
had
been
for
some
time
the
centre
of
resistance
to
the
new
movement
and
in
the
middle
of
september
a
report
became
current
that
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
the
obstruction
which
hampered
his
reform
policy
the
emperor
intended
to
seize
the
person
of
the
and
have
her
deported
into
the
interior
some
colour
was
given
to
this
report
by
an
official
announcement
that
the
emperor
would
hold
a
review
of
the
troops
at
tientsin
and
had
summoned
yuan
shihkai
their
general
to
peking
in
order
to
confer
with
him
on
the
necessary
arrangements
but
the
reformers
had
neglected
to
secure
the
goodwill
of
the
army
which
was
still
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
reactionaries
during
the
night
of
the
of
september
the
palace
of
the
emperor
was
occupied
by
the
soldiers
and
on
the
following
day
who
was
henceforth
virtually
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
the
empress
was
made
to
issue
an
edict
restoring
her
regency
kang
warned
at
the
last
moment
by
an
urgent
message
from
the
emperor
succeeded
in
escaping
but
many
of
the
most
prominent
reformers
were
arrested
and
six
of
them
were
promptly
executed
the
announced
a
few
days
later
that
the
emperor
himself
was
dangerously
ill
and
his
life
might
well
have
been
despaired
of
had
not
the
british
minister
represented
in
very
emphatic
terms
the
serious
consequences
which
might
ensue
if
anything
happened
to
him
drastic
measures
were
however
adopted
to
stamp
out
the
reform
movement
in
the
provinces
as
well
as
in
the
capital
the
reform
edicts
were
cancelled
the
associations
were
dissolved
their
newspapers
suppressed
and
those
who
did
not
care
to
save
themselves
by
a
hasty
recantation
of
their
errors
were
imprisoned
proscribed
or
exiled
in
october
the
reaction
had
already
been
accompanied
by
such
a
recrudescence
of
feeling
that
the
foreign
ministers
at
peking
had
to
bring
up
guards
from
the
fleet
for
the
protection
of
the
legations
and
to
demand
the
removal
from
the
capital
of
the
disorderly
soldiery
which
subsequently
played
so
sinister
a
part
in
the
troubles
of
june
but
the
unpleasant
impression
produced
by
these
incidents
was
in
a
great
measure
removed
by
the
demonstrative
reception
which
the
empress
hsi
gave
on
the
of
october
to
the
wives
of
the
foreign
representatives
an
act
of
courtesy
unprecedented
in
the
annals
of
the
chinese
court
the
boxer
movement
the
reactionary
tide
continued
to
rise
throughout
the
year
but
it
did
not
appear
materially
to
affect
the
foreign
relations
of
china
towards
the
end
of
the
year
the
brutal
murder
of
mr
brooks
an
english
missionary
in
had
compelled
attention
to
a
popular
movement
which
had
been
spreading
rapidly
throughout
that
province
and
the
adjoining
one
of
with
the
connivance
of
certain
high
officials
if
not
under
their
direct
patronage
the
origin
of
the
boxer
movement
is
obscure
its
name
is
derived
from
a
literal
translation
of
the
chinese
designation
the
fist
of
righteous
harmony
like
the
kindred
big
sword
society
it
appears
to
have
been
in
the
first
instance
merely
a
secret
association
of
malcontents
chiefly
drawn
from
the
lower
classes
whether
the
empress
hsi
and
her
manchu
advisers
had
deliberately
set
themselves
from
the
beginning
to
avert
the
danger
by
deflecting
what
might
have
been
a
revolutionary
movement
into
channels
or
whether
with
oriental
heedlessness
they
had
allowed
it
to
grow
until
they
were
powerless
to
control
it
they
had
unquestionably
resolved
to
take
it
under
their
protection
before
the
foreign
representatives
at
peking
had
realized
its
gravity
the
outrages
upon
native
christians
and
the
threats
against
foreigners
generally
went
on
increasing
the
boxers
openly
displayed
on
their
banners
the
device
exterminate
the
foreigners
and
save
the
dynasty
yet
the
representatives
of
the
powers
were
unable
to
obtain
any
effective
measures
against
the
rebels
or
even
a
definite
condemnation
of
their
methods
four
months
were
spent
in
futile
interviews
with
the
in
may
a
number
of
christian
villages
were
destroyed
and
native
converts
massacred
near
the
capital
on
the
of
june
two
english
missionaries
mr
robinson
and
mr
norman
were
murdered
at
yung
ching
from
peking
the
whole
country
was
overrun
with
bands
of
boxers
who
tore
up
the
railway
and
set
fire
to
the
stations
at
different
points
on
the
line
fortunately
a
mixed
body
of
marines
and
bluejackets
of
various
nationalities
numbering
officers
and
men
had
reached
peking
on
the
of
june
for
the
protection
of
the
legations
the
whole
city
was
in
a
state
of
turmoil
murder
and
pillage
were
of
daily
occurrence
the
reactionary
prince

of
the
emperor
and
the
manchus
generally
together
with
the
soldiery
under
the
notorious

with

the
european
residents
and
a
large
number
of
native
converts
took
refuge
in
the
british

where
preparations
were
hastily
made
in
view
of
a
threatened
attack
on

the
chancellor
of

murdered
by
chinese

on
the
night
of
the
most
of
the
foreign
buildings
churches
and
mission
houses
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
tatar

were
pillaged
and
burnt
and
hundreds
of

massacred

the
of

the

whilst
on

international
expedition
meanwhile
peking
had
been
completely
cut
off
since
the
from
all
communication
with
the
outside
world
and
in
view
of
the
gravity
of
the
situation
naval
and
military
forces
were
being
hurried
up
by
all
the
powers
to
the
gulf
of
on
the
of
june
admiral
sir
seymour
had
already
left
tientsin
with
a
mixed
force
of
british
russian
french
germans
austrians
italians
americans
and
japanese
to
repair
the
railway
and
restore
communications
with
peking
but
his
expedition
met
with
unexpectedly
severe
resistance
and
it
had
great
difficulty
in
making
good
its
retreat
after
suffering
heavy
losses
when
it
reached
tientsin
again
on
the
of
june
the
british
contingent
of
men
had
alone
lost
killed
and
wounded
out
of
a
total
casualty
list
of
killed
and
wounded
the
chinese
had
in
the
meantime
made
a
determined
attack
upon
the
foreign
settlements
at
tientsin
and
communication
between
the
city
and
the
sea
being
also
threatened
the
taku
forts
at
the
mouth
of
the
were
captured
by
the
allied
admirals
on
the
the
situation
at
tientsin
nevertheless
continued
precarious
and
it
was
not
till
the
arrival
of
considerable
reinforcements
that
the
troops
of
the
allied
powers
were
able
to
assume
the
offensive
taking
the
native
city
by
storm
on
july
at
a
cost
however
of
over
killed
and
wounded
even
in
this
emergency
international
jealousy
had
grievously
delayed
the
necessary
concentration
of
forces
no
power
was
so
favourably
situated
to
take
immediate
action
as
japan
and
the
british
government
who
had
strongly
urged
her
to
act
speedily
and
energetically
undertook
at
her
request
to
sound
the
other
powers
with
regard
to
her
intervention
no
definite
objection
was
raised
but
the
replies
of
germany
and
russia
barely
disguised
their
great
britain
herself
went
so
far
as
to
offer
japan
the
assistance
of
the
british
treasury
in
case
financial
difficulties
stood
in
the
way
but
on
the
same
day
on
which
this
proposal
was
telegraphed
to
tokyo
of
july
the
japanese
government
had
decided
to
embark
forthwith
the
two
divisions
which
it
had
already
mobilized
by
the
beginning
of
august
one
of
the
indian
brigades
had
also
reached
tientsin
together
with
smaller
reinforcements
sent
by
the
other
powers
and
thanks
chiefly
to
the
energetic
counsels
of
the
british
commander
general
sir
alfred
gaselee
a
relief
column
numbering
men
at
last
set
out
for
peking
on
the
of
august
a
british
naval
brigade
having
started
up
river
the
previous
afternoon
after
a
series
of
small
engagements
and
very
trying
marches
it
arrived
within
striking
distance
of
peking
on
the
evening
of
the
the
russians
tried
to
steal
a
march
upon
the
allies
during
the
night
but
were
checked
at
the
walls
and
suffered
heavy
losses
the
japanese
attacked
another
point
of
the
walls
the
next
morning
but
met
with
fierce
opposition
whilst
the
americans
were
delayed
by
getting
entangled
in
the
russian
line
of
advance
the
british
contingent
was
more
fortunate
and
skilfully
guided
to
an
unguarded
general
gaselee
and
a
party
of
sikhs
were
the
first
to
force
their
way
through
to
the
british
legation
about
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
august
the
long
siege
was
raised
siege
of
the
peking
legations
for
nearly
six
weeks
after
the
first
interruption
of
communications
no
news
reached
the
outside
world
from
peking
except
a
few
belated
messages
smuggled
through
the
chinese
lines
by
native
runners
urging
the
imperative
necessity
of
prompt
relief
during
the
greater
part
of
that
period
the
foreign
quarter
was
subjected
to
heavy
rifle
and
artillery
fire
and
the
continuous
fighting
at
close
quarters
with
the
hordes
of
chinese
regulars
as
well
as
boxers
decimated
the
scanty
ranks
of
the
defenders
the
supply
of
both
ammunition
and
food
was
slender
but
the
heroism
displayed
by
civilians
and
professional
combatants
alike
was
inexhaustible
in
their
anxiety
to
burn
out
the
british
legation
the
chinese
did
not
hesitate
to
set
fire
to
the
adjoining
buildings
of
the
hanlin
the
ancient
seat
of
chinese
classical
learning
and
the
storehouse
of
priceless
literary
treasures
and
state
archives
the
or
palace
of
prince
su
separated
only
by
a
canal
from
the
british
legation
formed
the
centre
of
the
international
position
and
was
held
with
indomitable
valour
by
a
small
japanese
force
under
colonel
sheba
assisted
by
a
few
italian
marines
and
volunteers
of
other
nationalities
and
a
number
of
christian
chinese
the
french
legation
on
the
extreme
right
and
the
section
of
the
city
wall
held
chiefly
by
germans
and
americans
were
also
points
of
vital
importance
which
had
to
bear
the
brunt
of
the
chinese
attack
little
is
known
as
to
what
passed
in
the
councils
of
the
chinese
court
during
the
siege
but
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
throughout
that
period
grave
divergences
of
opinion
existed
amongst
the
highest
officials
the
attack
upon
the
legations
appears
to
have
received
the
sanction
of
the
acting
upon
the
advice
of
prince
tuan
and
the
extreme
manchu
party
at
a
grand
council
held
during
the
night
of
the
june
upon
receipt
of
the
news
of
the
capture
of
the
taku
forts
by
the
international
forces
the
emperor
himself
as
well
as
prince
ching
and
a
few
other
influential
mandarins
strongly
protested
against
the
empress
decision
but
it
was
acclaimed
by
the
vast
majority
of
those
present
three
members
of
the
were
publicly
executed
for
attempting
to
modify
the
terms
of
an
imperial
edict
ordering
the
massacre
of
all
foreigners
throughout
the
provinces
and
most
of
the
manchu
nobles
and
high
officials
and
the
eunuchs
of
the
palace
who
played
an
important
part
in
chinese
politics
throughout
the
tenure
of
power
were
heart
and
soul
with
the
boxers
but
it
was
noted
by
the
defenders
of
the
legations
that
prince
ching
troops
seldom
took
part
or
only
in
a
way
in
the
fighting
which
was
chiefly
conducted
by
soldiery
and
the
boxer
levies
the
modern
artillery
which
the
chinese
possessed
was
only
spasmodically
brought
into
play
nor
did
any
of
the
attacking
parties
ever
show
the
fearlessness
and
determination
which
the
chinese
had
somewhat
unexpectedly
displayed
on
several
occasions
during
the
fighting
at
and
around
tientsin
nevertheless
the
position
of
the
defenders
at
the
end
of
the
first
four
weeks
of
the
siege
had
grown
desperate
mining
and
incendiarism
proved
far
greater
dangers
than
shot
and
shell
suddenly
just
when
things
were
looking
blackest
on
the
of
july
the
chinese
ceased
firing
and
a
sort
of
informal
armistice
secured
a
period
of
respite
for
the
beleaguered
europeans
the
capture
of
the
native
city
of
tientsin
by
the
allied
forces
had
shaken
the
of
the
chinese
authorities
who
had
hitherto
not
only
countenanced
but
themselves
directed
the
hostilities
desultory
fighting
nevertheless
continued
and
grave
fears
were
entertained
that
the
approach
of
the
relief
column
would
prove
the
signal
for
a
desperate
attempt
to
rush
the
legations
the
attempt
was
made
but
failed
the
relief
however
came
not
a
day
too
soon
of
the
small
band
of
defenders
which
including
civilian
volunteers
had
never
mustered
had
been
killed
and
wounded
ammunition
and
provisions
were
almost
at
an
end
even
more
desperate
was
the
situation
at
the
the
roman
catholic
northern
cathedral
and
mission
house
where
with
the
help
of
a
small
body
of
french
and
italian
marines
mgr
favier
had
organized
an
independent
centre
of
resistance
for
his
community
of
over
souls
their
rations
were
absolutely
exhausted
when
on
the
of
august
a
relief
party
was
despatched
to
their
assistance
from
the
legations
looting
of
peking
the
ruin
wrought
in
peking
during
the
two
months
fighting
was
appalling
apart
from
the
wholesale
destruction
of
foreign
property
in
the
tatar
city
and
of
chinese
as
well
as
european
buildings
in
the
vicinity
of
the
legations
the
wealthiest
part
of
the
chinese
city
had
been
laid
in
ashes
the
flames
from
a
foreign
drug
store
fired
by
the
boxers
had
spread
to
the
adjoining
buildings
and
finally
consumed
the
whole
of
the
business
quarter
with
all
its
invaluable
stores
of
silks
curiosities
furs
the
retribution
which
overtook
peking
after
its
capture
by
the
international
forces
was
scarcely
less
terrible
looting
was
for
some
days
almost
universal
order
was
however
gradually
restored
first
in
the
japanese
and
then
in
the
british
and
american
quarters
though
several
months
elapsed
before
there
was
any
real
revival
of
native
confidence
flight
of
the
chinese
court
so
unexpected
had
been
the
rapid
and
victorious
advance
of
the
allies
that
the
with
the
emperor
and
the
rest
of
the
court
did
not
actually
leave
peking
until
the
day
after
the
legations
had
been
relieved
but
the
northern
and
western
portions
of
the
tatar
city
had
not
yet
been
occupied
and
the
fugitives
made
good
their
escape
on
the
when
the
allies
some
days
later
marched
through
the
forbidden
city
they
only
found
a
few
eunuchs
and
subordinate
officials
in
charge
of
the
imperial
apartments
at
the
end
of
september
field
marshal
count
von
waldersee
with
a
german
expeditionary
force
of
over

to
assume
the
supreme
command
conferred
upon
him
with
the
more
or
less
willing
assent
of
the
other
powers
restoration
of
order
the
political
task
which
confronted
the
powers
after
the
occupation
of
peking
was
far
more
arduous
than
the
military
one
the
action
of
the
russians
in
manchuria
even
in
a
treaty
port
like
the
seizure
of
the
railway
line
not
only
to
the
north
of
the
great
wall
but
also
from
to
peking
by
the
russian
military
authorities
and
the
appropriation
of
an
extensive
line
of
river
frontage
at
tientsin
as
a
russian
settlement
were
difficult
to
reconcile
with
the
pacific
assurances
of
disinterestedness
which
russia
like
the
rest
of
the
powers
had
officially
given
great
anxiety
prevailed
as
to
the
effect
of
the
flight
of
the
chinese
court
in
other
parts
of
the
empire
the
movement
had
not
spread
much
beyond
the
northern
provinces
in
which
it
had
had
the
open
support
of
the
throne
and
of
the
highest
provincial
officials
but
among
british
and
americans
alone
over
defenceless
foreigners
men
women
and
children
chiefly
missionaries
had
fallen
victims
to
the
treachery
of
mandarins
like
yü
hsien
and
hundreds
of
others
had
had
to
fly
for
their
lives
many
of
them
owing
their
escape
to
the
courageous
protection
of
petty
officials
and
of
the
local
gentry
and
peasantry
in
the
yangtsze
valley
order
had
been
maintained
by
the
energy
of
the
viceroys
of
nanking
and
who
had
acted
throughout
the
critical
period
in
loyal
with
the
british
consuls
and
naval
commanders
and
had
courageously
disregarded
the
imperial
edicts
issued
during
the
ascendancy
of
the
boxers
after
some
hesitation
an
indian
brigade
followed
by
french
german
and
japanese
contingents
had
been
landed
at
shanghai
for
the
protection
of
the
settlements
and
though
the
viceroy
liu
had
welcomed
british
support
and
even
invited
the
joint
occupation
of
the
yangtsze
forts
by
british
and
chinese
troops
the
appearance
of
other
european
forces
in
the
yangtsze
valley
was
viewed
with
great
suspicion
in
the
south
there
were
serious
symptoms
of
unrest
especially
after
li
had
left
canton
for
the
north
in
obedience
as
he
alleged
at
the
time
to
an
imperial
edict
which
there
is
reason
to
believe
he
invented
for
the
occasion
the
chinese
court
after
one
or
two
intermediate
halts
had
retired
to
one
of
the
ancient
capitals
of
the
empire
situated
in
the
inaccessible
province
of
over
of
peking
the
influence
of
the
headed
by
prince
tuan
and
general
still
dominated
its
councils
although
credentials
were
sent
to
prince
ching
and
to
li
who
after
waiting
upon
events
at
shanghai
had
proceeded
to
peking
authorizing
them
to
treat
with
the
powers
for
the
of
friendly
relations
measures
of
reparation
the
harmony
of
the
powers
which
had
been
maintained
with
some
difficulty
up
to
the
relief
of
the
legations
was
subjected
to
a
severe
strain
as
soon
as
the
basis
of
negotiations
with
the
chinese
government
came
to
be
discussed
while
for
various
reasons
russia
japan
and
the
united
states
were
inclined
to
treat
china
with
great
indulgence
germany
insisted
upon
the
signal
punishment
of
the
guilty
officials
as
a
sine
qua
and
in
this
she
had
the
support
not
only
of
the
other
members
of
the
triple
alliance
but
also
of
great
britain
and
to
some
extent
even
of
france
who
as
protector
of
the
roman
catholic
church
in
eastern
countries
could
not
allow
the
authors
of
the
atrocities
committed
upon
its
followers
to
escape
effectual
punishment
it
was
not
until
after
months
of
laborious
negotiations
that
the
demands
to
be
formally
made
upon
the
chinese
government
were
embodied
in
a
joint
note
signed
by
all
the
foreign
ministers
on
the
and
of
december
the
demands
were
substantially
as
follows
honourable
reparation
for
the
murder
of
von
ketteler
and
of
mr
sugiyama
to
be
made
in
a
specified
form
and
expiatory
monuments
to
be
erected
in
cemeteries
where
foreign
tombs
had
been
desecrated
the
most
severe
punishment
befitting
their
crimes
was
to
be
inflicted
on
the
personages
designated
by
the
decree
of
the
of
september
and
also
upon
others
to
be
designated
later
by
the
foreign
ministers
and
the
official
examinations
were
to
be
suspended
in
the
cities
where
foreigners
had
been
murdered
or
an
equitable
indemnity
guaranteed
by
financial
measures
acceptable
to
the
powers
was
to
be
paid
to
states
societies
and
individuals
including
chinese
who
had
suffered
because
of
their
employment
by
foreigners
but
not
including
chinese
christians
who
had
suffered
only
on
account
of
their
faith
the
importation
or
manufacture
of
arms
or
was
to
be
forbidden
permanent
legation
guards
were
to
be
maintained
at
peking
and
the
diplomatic
quarter
was
to
be
fortified
while
communication
with
the
sea
was
to
be
secured
by
a
foreign
military
occupation
of
the
strategic
points
and
by
the
demolition
of
the
chinese
forts
including
the
taku
forts
between
the
capital
and
the
coast
proclamations
were
to
be
posted
throughout
china
for
two
years
threatening
death
to
the
members
of
societies
and
recording
the
punishment
of
the
ringleaders
in
the
late
outrages
and
the
viceroys
governors
and
provincial
officials
were
to
be
declared
by
imperial
edict
responsible
on
pain
of
immediate
dismissal
and
perpetual
disability
to
hold
office
for
outbreaks
or
violations
of

within
their
jurisdictions
china
was
to
facilitate
commercial
relations
by
negotiating
a
revision
of
the
commercial
treaties
the
was
to
be
reformed
and
the
ceremonial
for
the
reception
of
foreign
ministers
modified
as
the
powers
should
demand
compliance
with
these
terms
was
declared
to
be
a
condition
precedent
to
the
arrangement
of
a
time
limit
to
the
occupation
of
peking
and
of
the
provinces
by
foreign
troops
under
instructions
from
the
court
the
chinese
plenipotentiaries
affixed
their
signatures
on
the
of
january
to
a
protocol
by
which
china
pledged
herself
to
accept
these
terms
in
principle
and
the
conference
of
ministers
then
proceeded
to
discuss
the
definite
form
in
which
compliance
with
them
was
to
be
exacted
this
further
stage
of
the
negotiations
proved
even
more
laborious
and
protracted
than
the
preliminary
proceedings
no
attempt
was
made
to
raise
the
question
of
the
responsibility
for
the
movement
as
russia
had
from
the
first
set
her
face
against
the
introduction
of
what
she
euphemistically
termed
the
dynastic
question
but
even
with
regard
to
the
punishment
of
officials
whose
guilt
was
beyond
dispute
grave
divergences
arose
between
the
powers
the
death
penalty
was
ultimately
waived
in
the
case
even
of
such
conspicuous
offenders
as
prince
tuan
and
but
the
notorious
yü
hsien
and
two
others
were
decapitated
by
the
chinese
and
three
other
metropolitan
officials
were
ordered
to
commit
suicide
whilst
upon
others
sentences
of
banishment
imprisonment
and
degradation
were
passed
in
accordance
with
a
list
drawn
up
by
the
foreign
representatives
the
question
of
the
punishment
of
provincial
officials
responsible
for
the
massacre
of
scores
of
defenceless
men
women
and
children
was
unfortunately
reserved
for
separate
treatment
and
when
it
came
up
for
discussion
it
became
impossible
to
preserve
even
the
semblance
of
unanimity
the
russian
minister
at
once
taking
issue
with
his
colleagues
although
he
had
originally
pledged
himself
as
formally
as
the
others
to
the
principle
count
lamsdorff
frankly
told
the
british
ambassador
at
st
petersburg
that
russia
took
no
interest
in
missionaries
and
as
the
foreigners
massacred
in
the
provinces
belonged
mostly
to
that
class
she
declined
to
join
in
the
action
of
the
other
powers
russia
and
manchuria
the
real
explanation
of
russia
cynical
secession
from
the
concert
of
powers
on
this
important
issue
must
be
sought
in
her
anxiety
to
conciliate
the
chinese
in
view
of
the
separate
negotiations
in
which
she
was
at
the
same
time
engaged
with
china
in
respect
of
manchuria
when
the
boxer
movement
was
at
its
height
at
the
end
of
june
the
chinese
authorities
in
manchuria
had
wantonly
declared
war
against
russia
and
for
a
moment
a
great
wave
of
panic
seems
to
have
swept
over
the
russian
administration
civil
and
military
in
the
adjoining
provinces
the
reprisals
exercised
by
the
russians
were
proportionately
fierce
the
massacre
at
blagovyeshchensk
where
chinese
men
women
and
children
were
flung
into
the
amur
by
the
cossacks
was
only
one
incident
in
the
reign
of
terror
by
which
the
russians
sought
to
restore
their
power
and
their
prestige
the
resistance
of
the
chinese
troops
was
soon
overcome
and
russian
forces
overran
the
whole
province
occupying
even
the
treaty
port
of
the
russian
government
officially
repudiated
all
responsibility
for
the
proclamations
issued
by
general
gribsky
and
others
foreshadowing
if
not
actually
proclaiming
the
annexation
of
chinese
territory
to
the
russian
empire
but
russia
was
clearly
bent
on
seizing
the
opportunity
for
securing
a
permanent
hold
upon
manchuria
in
december
a
preliminary
agreement
was
made
between
korostovetz
the
russian
and
tseng
the
tatar
general
at
mukden
by
which
the
civil
and
military
administration
of
the
whole
province
was
virtually
placed
under
russian
control
in
february
negotiations
were
opened
between
the
russian
government
and
the
chinese
minister
at
st
petersburg
for
the
conclusion
of
a
formal
convention
of
a
still
more
comprehensive
character
in
return
for
the
restoration
to
china
of
a
certain
measure
of
civil
authority
in
manchuria
russia
was
to
be
confirmed
in
the
possession
of
exclusive
military
civil
and
commercial
rights
constituting
in
all
but
name
a
protectorate
and
she
was
also
to
acquire
preferential
rights
over
all
the
outlying
provinces
of
the
chinese
empire
bordering
on
the
russian
dominions
in
asia
the
clauses
relating
to
chinese
turkestan
kashgar
yarkand
khotan
and
mongolia
were
subsequently
stated
to
have
been
dropped
but
the
convention
nevertheless
provoked
considerable
opposition
both
in
foreign
countries
and
amongst
the
chinese
themselves
most
of
the
powers
including
germany
who
however
denied
that
the
agreement
of
the
of
october
applied
to
manchuria
advised
the
chinese
government
not
to
pursue
separate
negotiations
with
one
power
whilst
collective
negotiations
were
in
progress
at
peking
and
both
japan
and
great
britain
pressed
for
definite
information
at
st
petersburg
with
regard
to
the
precise
tenor
of
the
proposed
convention
at
the
same
time
the
two
viceroys
of
the
lower
yangtsze
memorialized
the
throne
in
the
strongest
terms
against
the
convention
and
these
protests
were
endorsed
not
only
by
the
great
majority
of
chinese
officials
of
high
rank
throughout
the
provinces
but
by
popular
meetings
and
influential
guilds
and
associations
ultimately
the
two
viceroys
chang
and
liu
took
the
extreme
step
of
warning
the
throne
that
they
would
be
unable
to
recognize
the
convention
even
if
it
were
ratified
and
notwithstanding
the
pressure
exercised
in
favour
of
russia
by
li
the
court
finally
instructed
the
chinese
minister
at
st
petersburg
to
decline
his
signature
the
attitude
of
japan
where
public
feeling
ran
high
was
equally
significant
and
on
the
of
april
the
russian
government
issued
a
circular
note
to
the
powers
stating
that
as
the
generous
intentions
of
russia
had
been
misconstrued
she
withdrew
the
proposed
convention
the
peace
protocol
the
work
of
the
conference
at
peking
which
had
been
temporarily
disturbed
by
these
complications
was
then
resumed
friction
between
european
troops
of
different
nationalities
and
an
dispute
over
the
construction
of
certain
roads
and
railway
sidings
at
tientsin
showed
that
an
international
occupation
was
fraught
with
manifold
dangers
the
question
of
indemnities
however
gave
rise
to
renewed
friction
each
power
drew
up
its
own
claim
and
whilst
great
britain
the
united
states
and
japan
displayed
great
moderation
other
powers
especially
germany
and
italy
put
in
claims
which
were
strangely
out
of
proportion
to
the
services
rendered
by
their
military
and
naval
forces
it
was
at
last
settled
that
china
should
pay
altogether
an
indemnity
of
million
taels
to
be
secured
on
the
unhypothecated
balance
of
the
customs
revenue
administered
by
the
imperial
maritime
customs
the
import
duties
being
raised
forthwith
to
an
effective
basis
on
the
revenues
of
the
native
customs
in
the
treaty
ports
on
the
total
revenues
of
the
salt
gabelle
finally
the
peace
protocol
was
drawn
up
in
a
form
which
satisfied
all
the
powers
as
well
as
the
chinese
court
the
formal
signature
was
however
delayed
at
the
last
moment
by
a
fresh
difficulty
concerning
prince
chun
penitential
mission
to
berlin
this
prince
an
amiable
and
enlightened
youth
son
of
the
prince
chun
who
was
the
emperor
brother
and
thus
himself
to
the
emperor
had
reached
basel
towards
the
end
of
august
on
his
way
to
germany
when
he
was
suddenly
informed
that
he
and
his
suite
would
be
expected
to
perform
before
the
german
emperor
the
prince
resented
this
unexpected
demand
and
referred
home
for
instructions
the
chinese
court
appear
to
have
remained
obdurate
and
the
german
government
perceived
the
mistake
that
had
been
made
in
exacting
from
the
chinese
prince
a
form
of
homage
which
western
diplomacy
had
for
more
than
a
century
refused
to
yield
to
the
son
of
heaven
on
the
ground
that
it
was
barbarous
and
degrading
the
point
was
waived
and
prince
chun
was
received
in
solemn
audience
by
the
emperor
william
at
potsdam
on
the
of
september
three
days
later
on
the
of
september
the
peace
protocol
was
signed
at
peking
the
articles
recorded
the
steps
to
be
taken
to
satisfy
the
demands
of

the
amendment
of
existing
treaties
of

and

at
tientsin
and
shanghai
the
british
government
appointed
a
special
commission
with
sir
mackay
member
of
the
council
of
india
as
chief
commissioner
to
proceed
to
shanghai
to
carry
on
the
negotiations
and
a
commercial
treaty
was
signed
at
shanghai
on
the
of
september
by
which
existing
obstacles
to
foreign
trade
such
as
were
removed
regulations
were
made
for
facilitating
steamer
navigation
on
inland
waters
and
several
new
ports
were
opened
to
foreign
commerce
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
protocol
all
the
foreign
troops
except
the
legation
guards
were
withdrawn
from
peking
on
the
of
september
and
from
the
rest
of
except

garrisons
at
the
different
points
specified
along
the
line
of
communications
by
the
of
september
on
the
of
october
it
was
announced
that
the
chinese
court
had
left
on
its
way
back
to
the
northern
capital
a
month
later
of
november
the
death
of
li
at
peking
removed
if
not
the
greatest
of
chinese
statesmen
at
any
rate
the
one
who
had
enjoyed
the
largest
share
of
the
confidence
e
to
awakening
of
china
the
events
connected
with
the
boxer
rising
and
its
suppression
demonstrated
even
more
forcibly
than
had
the
war
with
japan
in
the
necessity
for
the
adoption
of
western
methods
in
many
departments
of
life
and
administration
if
china
was
to
maintain
the
position
of
a
great
power
the
necessity
for
a
thorough
reform
of
the
administration
was
widely
recognized
in
and
among
the
progressive
classes
of
the
community
much
disappointment
was
manifested
because
the
powers
had
failed
to
insist
in
the
conditions
of
peace
on
a
reorganization
of
the
machinery
of
government
the
yangtsze
viceroys
the
viceroy
at
canton
yuan
and
other
high
mandarins
repeatedly
memorialized
the
throne
to
grant
effective
reforms
while
at
the
court
did
in
fact
issue
several
reform
decrees
but
at
the
same
time
all
authority
remained
in
the
hands
of
reactionaries
there
had
been
an
awakening
in
china
but
another
lesson
afforded
a
few
years
later
by
the
war
was
needed
before
the
reform
party
was
able
to
gain
real
power
for
three
or
four
years
following
the
signing
of
the
peace
protocol
of
it
seemed
indeed
that
there
would
be
little
change
in
the
system
of
government
though
in
some
directions
a
return
to
the
old
state
of
affairs
was
neither
possible
nor
desired
on
the
of
january
the
court
returned
to
peking
a
step
which
marked
the
restoration
more
or
less
of
normal
conditions
the
failure
of
the
boxer
movement
in
which
as
has
been
shown
she
was
deeply
implicated
had
impressed
upon
the
dowager
empress
the
need
for
living
on
better
terms
with
foreign
powers
but
the
reform
edicts
issued
from
remained
largely
inoperative
though
some
steps
were
taken
to
promote
education
on
western
lines
to
readjust
the
land
tax
and
especially
to
reorganize
the
military
forces
though
on
provincial
rather
than
on
a
national
basis
the
building
of
railways
was
also
pushed
on
but
the
dowager
empress
was
probably
at
heart
as
reactionary
as
she
had
proved
in
the
emperor
himself
from
his
return
to
peking
until
the
day
of
his
death
appeared
to
have
little
influence
on
public
affairs
the
most
disquieting
feature
of
the
situation
in
the
years
immediately
following
the
return
of
the
court
to
peking
was
the
continued
efforts
of
russia
to
obtain
full
control
of
manchuria
and
a
predominant
influence
in
north
china
the
chinese
government
was
powerless
to
stem
the
advance
of
russia
and
the
dowager
empress
herself
was
credited
with
indifference
to
the
fate
of
manchuria
it
was
the
menace
to
other
powers
notably
japan
involved
in
russia
action
which
precipitated
an
issue
in
which
the
destinies
of
china
were
involved
before
considering
the
results
of
that
struggle
the
war
the
chief
events
of
the
years
may
be
outlined
relations
with
europeans
the
dowager
empress
from
the
day
of
her
return
from
set
herself
to
conciliate
the
foreign
residents
in
peking
many
foreign
onlookers
were
gathered
on
the
wall
of
the
tatar
city
to
witness
the
return
of
the
court
and
to
these
the
dowager
empress
made
a
deep
bow
twice
an
apparently
trivial
incident
which
made
a
lasting
impression
on
the
of
february
following
the
dowager
empress
received
the
ladies
of
the
various
embassies
when
she
bewailed
the
attack
on
the
legations
entertained
her
guests
to
tea
and
presented
each
with
articles
of
jewelry
and
from
that
time
onward
as
occasion
offered
hsi
exchanged
compliments
and
civilities
with
the
foreign
ladies
in
peking
moreover
sir
robert
hart
after
having
been
nearly
forty
years
in
china
was
now
presented
at
court
as
well
as
bishop
favier
and
others
henceforth
attacks
on
foreigners
received
no
direct
encouragement
at
court
tung
who
had
been
banished
to
the
remote
province
of
had
at
his
command
there
his
old
boxer
troops
and
his
attitude
caused
anxiety
at
the
end
of
he
was
said
to
have
received
support
from
prince
tuan
who
had
been
obliged
to
retire
to
mongolia
but
events
proved
that
the
power
or
the
intention
of
these
reactionaries
to
create
trouble
had
been
miscalculated
there
were
indeed
serious
boxer
disturbances
in
in
but
they
were
put
down
by
a
new
viceroy
sent
from
peking
notwithstanding
the
murder
of
fifteen
missionaries
during
there
was
in
general
a
marked
improvement
in
the
relations
between
the
missionaries
the
official
classes
and
the
bulk
of
the
people
and
an
eagerness
was
shown
in
several
provinces
to
take
advantage
of
their
educational
work
this
was
specially
marked
in
a
province
which
had
been
for
long
hostile
to
missionary
endeavours
illustrative
of
the
attitude
of
numbers
of
high
officials
was
the
attendance
of
the
viceroy
of
with
the
whole
of
his
staff
at
the
opening
in
at
of
new
buildings
of
the
canadian
methodist
mission
this
friendly
attitude
towards
the
missions
was
due
in
part
to
the
influence
of
chinese
educated
abroad
and
also
to
a
large
extent
to
the
desire
to
take
advantage
of
western
culture
the
spread
of
this
new
spirit
was
coincident
with
an
agitation
for
independence
of
foreign
control
and
the
determination
of
the
chinese
to
use
modern
methods
to
attain
their
ends
thus
in
there
was
an
extensive
boycott
of
american
goods
throughout
china
as
a
retaliatory
measure
for
the
exclusion
of
chinese
from
the
united
states
regarding
china
as
a
whole
the
attitude
of
the
people
towards
europeans
was
held
to
indicate
that
the
general
view
was
not
that
the
boxer
teaching
was
false
but
that
the
spirits
behind
western
religion
were
more
powerful
than
those
behind
the
spiritual
prestige
of
christianity
and
respect
for
the
power
of
the
foreigner
were
direct
outcomes
of
the
failure
of
the
boxers
the
british
expedition
to
tibet
in
the
occupation
of
lhassa
in
august
of
that
year
the
flight
of
the
dalai
lama
to
mongolia
gave
grave
concern
to
the
chinese
government
which
showed
much
persistence
in
enforcing
its
suzerain
rights
in
tibet
but
did
not
apparently
cause
any
towards
great
britain
among
the
chinese
people
who
viewed
with
seeming
equanimity
the
flight
of
the
head
of
the
buddhist
religion
from
the
headquarters
of
that
faith
the
country
generally
was
peaceful
a
rebellion
in
where
a
terrible
famine
occurred
in
being
suppressed
in
by
the
forces
of
the
viceroy
at
canton
commercial
and
railway
progress
the
expiatory
measures
required
of
china
in
connexion
with
the
boxer
rising
were
carried
through
china
during
recovered
possession
of
the
railway
and
of
the
city
of
tientsin
which
was
evacuated
by
the
foreign
troops
in
august
of
that
year
the
foreign
troops
were
also
all
withdrawn
from
shanghai
by
january
the
conclusion
of
a
new
commercial
treaty
between
great
britain
and
china
in
september
has
already
been
recorded
the
payment
of
the
indemnity
instalments
occasioned
some
dispute
owing
to
the
fall
in
silver
in
but
the
rise
in
the
value
of
the
tael
in
subsequent
years
led
china
to
agree
to
the
payment
of
the
indemnity
on
a
gold
basis
the
increase
in
revenue
was
a
notable
feature
of
the
maritime
customs
in
this
result
was
in
part
due
to
the
new
arrangements
under
the
commercial
treaty
of
and
in
part
to
the
opening
up
of
the
country
by
railways
in
especial
the
great
trunk
line
from
peking
to
hankow
was
pushed
on
the
line
including
a
bridge
nearly
long
over
the
yellow
river
was
completed
and
opened
for
traffic
in
the
first
section
of
the
railway
was
opened
in
the
same
year
at
this
time
the
chinese
showed
a
strong
desire
to
obtain
the
control
of
the
various
lines
during
for
instance
the
railway
concession
was
repurchased
by
the
chinese
government
from
an
american
company
while
the
pekin
syndicate
a
british
concern
also
sold
their
railway
in
to
the
chinese
government
manchuria
russia
action
regarding
manchuria
overshadowed
however
all
other
concerns
during
this
period
the
withdrawal
of
the
proposed
agreement
of
has
been
chronicled
the
russian
government
had
however
no
intention
of
abandoning
its
hold
on
manchuria
it
aimed
not
only
at
effective
military
control
but
the
reservation
to
russian
subjects
of
mining
railway
and
commercial
rights
both
the
sovereignty
of
china
and
the
commercial
interests
of
other
nations
were
menaced
this
led
to
action
by
various
powers
the
preamble
of
the
treaty
of
the
of
january
declared
the
main
motives
of
the
contracting
parties
to
be
the
maintenance
of
the
independence
and
territorial
integrity
of
china
and
korea
and
the
securing
of
equal
opportunities
in
those
countries
for
the
commerce
and
industry
of
all
nations
the
policy
of
the
open
door
protests
were
lodged
by
great
britain
japan
and
the
united
states
against
the
grant
of
exclusive
rights
to
russian
subjects
in
manchuria
russia
asserted
her
intention
to
respect
the
commercial
rights
of
other
nations
and
on
the
of
april
an
agreement
was
signed
at
peking
which
appeared
to
show
the
good
faith
of
the
russian
government
as
it
provided
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
russian
troops
in
manchuria
within
eighteen
months
from
that
date
in
accordance
with
this
agreement
the
railway
was
transferred
to
china
in
october
and
the
district
between
and
the
liao
river
evacuated
by
russia
but
it
soon
appeared
that
russia
hold
on
the
country
had
not
relaxed
advantage
was
taken
of
the
terms
of
concession
granted
in
august
to
the
bank
to
erect
towns
for
russian
colonists
and
to
plant
garrisons
along
the
line
of
railway
and
to
exclude
chinese
jurisdiction
altogether
from
the
railway
zone
the
evacuation
became
in
fact
the
concentration
of
the
russian
forces
along
the
line
of
railway
moreover
the
maritime
customs
at
were
retained
by
the
bank
despite
protests
from
the
chinese
imperial
authorities
and
a
russian
civil
administration
was
established
at
that
port
the
evacuation
of
southern
manchuria
should
have
taken
place
in
april
but
in
that
month
instead
of
fulfilling
the
conditions
of
the
agreement
the
russian
chargé
in
peking
made
a
series
of
further
demands
upon
china
including
the
virtual
reservation
of
the
commerce
of
manchuria
for
russian
subjects
though
russia
officially
denied
to
the
british
and
american
governments
that
she
had
made
these
demands
it
was
demonstrated
that
they
had
been
made
the
united
states
and
japan
thereupon
insisted
that
china
should
conclude
with
them
commercial
treaties
throwing
open
mukden
and
two
ports
on
the
yalu
river
to
foreign
trade
the
american
treaty
was
signed
on
the
of
october
the
day
fixed
for
the
complete
evacuation
of
manchuria
by
russia
and
the
japanese
treaty
on
the
day
following
both
treaties
provided
that
the
ports
should
be
opened
after
ratifications
had
been
exchanged
from
fear
of
russia
china
however
delayed
the
ratification
of
the
treaties
meantime
in
august
a
regular
through
railway
service
between
moscow
and
port
arthur
was
established
in
the
same
month
a
russian
viceroyalty
of
the
far
east
was
created
which
in
effect
claimed
manchuria
as
a
russian
province
in
september
russia
withdrew
some
of
the
demands
she
had
made
in
april
but
her
concessions
proved
illusory
when
the
of
october
passed
and
it
was
seen
that
the
russians
had
not
withdrawn
their
troops
there
issued
for
a
time
threats
of
war
from
peking
yuan
the
viceroy
of
who
had
at
his
command
some
troops
trained
by
japanese
officers
pressed
on
the
government
the
necessity
of
action
at
this
point
japan
intervened
her
interests
were
vitally
affected
by
russia
action
not
only
in
manchuria
but
in
korea
and
seeing
that
china
was
powerless
the
japanese
government
negotiated
directly
with
st
petersburg
in
these
negotiations
russia
showed
that
she
would
not
yield
her
position
in
either
country
except
to
force
japan
chose
the
issue
of
war
and
proved
successful
lessons
of
the
war
the
war
did
not
very
greatly
alter
china
position
in
manchuria
in
the
southern
part
of
that
country
japan
succeeded
to
the
special
privileges
russia
had
wrung
from
china
including
the
lease
of
port
arthur
in
the
north
russia
remained
in
possession
of
the
railway
zone
for
japan
position
as
at
once
the
legatee
of
special
privileges
and
the
champion
of
china
territorial
integrity
and
the
open
door
see
japan
however
the
attitude
of
japan
was
more
conciliatory
than
that
of
russia
had
been
mukden
and
other
places
were
thrown
open
to
foreign
trade
and
chinese
civil
administration
was
the
important
results
of
the
war
so
far
as
china
was
concerned
were
not
to
be
looked
for
in
manchuria
but
in
the
new
spirit
generated
in
the
chinese
they
had
been
deeply
humiliated
by
the
fact
that
in
the
struggle
between
russia
and
japan
china
had
been
treated
as
a
negligible
quantity
and
that
the
war
had
been
fought
on
chinese
territory
the
lesson
which
the
loot
of
peking
and
the
fall
of
the
boxers
in
had
half
taught
was
now
thoroughly
mastered
the
awakening
of
china
was
complete
the
war
had
shown
that
when
an
eastern
race
adopted
western
methods
it
was
capable
of
defeating
a
european
nation
army
reform
it
was
fortunate
that
among
the
influential
advisers
of
the
throne
at
this
time
were
prince
chun
the
prince
who
had
visited
germany
in
yuan
the
viceroy
of
and
chang
the
viceroy
of
the
provinces
of
and
all
men
of
enlightened
and
strong
character
in
both
the
viceroys
named
were
summoned
to
peking
and
made
members
of
the
grand
council
of
which
prince
ching
a
man
of
moderate
views
was
president
yuan
was
an
open
advocate
of
a
reform
of
the
civil
service
of
the
abolition
of
manchu
privileges
of
education
and
other
matters
he
had
specially
advocated
the
reconstitution
of
the
military
forces
of
the
empire
and
in
in
he
demonstrated
before
a
number
of
foreign
military
attachés
the
high
efficiency
attained
by
the
forces
of
the
metropolitan
province
the
success
achieved
by
yuan
in
this
direction
incited
chang
to
follow
his
example
while
a
decree
from
the
throne
called
upon
the
princes
and
nobles
of
china
to
give
their
sons
a
military
education
the
formerly
despised
military
profession
was
thus
made
honourable
and
with
salutary
effects
the
imperial
princes
sought
high
commands
officers
were
awarded
ranks
and
dignities
comparable
with
those
of
civil
servants
and
the
pay
of
the
troops
was
increased
the
new
foreign
drilled
northern
army
was
called
upon
to
furnish
a
large
proportion
of
a
force
sent
under
prince
su
into
mongolia
a
country
which
had
been
on
the
point
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
russia
but
over
which
as
one
result
of
the
war
china
recovered
control
in
a
step
was
taken
towards
the
formation
of
a
national
army
by
withdrawing
portions
of
the
troops
from
provincial
control
and
placing
them
under
officers
responsible
to
the
central
government
which
also
took
over
the
charge
of
the
provincial
arsenals
in
the
years
which
followed
further
evidence
was
given
of
the
earnestness
and
success
with
which
the
military
forces
were
being
reorganized
less
attention
was
given
to
naval
affairs
but
in
the
autumn
of
a
naval
commission
under
tsai
hsün
a
brother
of
the
emperor
was
sent
to
europe
to
report
on
the
steps
necessary
for
the
of
a
fleet
previously
in
societies
had
been
started
in
several
provinces
to
collect
funds
for
naval
purposes
a
parliamentary
constitution
promised
the
most
striking
evidence
of
the
change
which
had
occurred
was
however
the
appointment
in
of
an
imperial
commission
headed
by
prince
tsai
tse
to
study
the
administrative
systems
of
foreign
countries
with
a
view
to
the
possible
establishment
of
a
representative
government
in
china
the
revolutionary
nature
of
this
proposal
excited
indignation
among
the
adherents
to
the
old
order
and
a
bomb
was
thrown
among
the
commissioners
as
they
were
preparing
to
leave
peking
after
visiting
japan
america
and
europe
the
commission
returned
to
peking
in
july
a
committee
over
which
prince
ching
presided
was
appointed
to
study
the
commission
report
and
on
the
of
september
following
an
edict
was
issued
in
which
the
establishment
of
a
parliamentary
form
of
government
was
announced
at
a
date
not
fixed
to
fit
the
country
for
this
new
form
of
government
the
edict
went
on
to
declare
the
administration
must
be
reformed
the
laws
revised
education
promoted
and
the
finances
regulated
this
edict
moreover
was
but
one
of
many
edicts
issued
in
and
following
years
which
showed
how
great
a
break
with
the
past
was
contemplated
in
november
two
edicts
were
issued
with
the
object
of
reorganizing
the
central
administrative
offices
their
effect
was
to
simplify
the
conduct
of
business
many
useless
posts
being
abolished
while
an
audit
board
was
created
to
examine
the
national
accounts
in
november
another
edict
was
promulgated
stating
that
for
the
present
the
formation
of
houses
of
lords
and
of
commons
to
determine
all
public
questions
was
not
practicable
but
that
it
was
proposed
as
a
preliminary
measure
to
create
an
imperial
assembly
at
the
same
time
a
scheme
of
provincial
councils
was
ordered
to
be
prepared
a
more
definite
step
followed
in
when
a
decree
dated
the
of
august
announced
the
convocation
of
a
parliament
in
the
ninth
year
from
that
date
the
control
of
the
maritime
customs
one
of
the
changes
made
in
the
public
offices
brought
china
into
conflict
with
great
britain
on
the
of
may
a
decree
appointed
chinese
commissioners
to
control
the
imperial
maritime
customs
this
was
the
only
department
of
the
government
under
european
british
control
and
the
only
department
also
against
which
no
charge
of
inefficiency
or
corruption
could
be
brought
the
change
decreed
by
china
was
in
accord
with
the
new
national
sentiment
but
by
all
the
foreign
powers
interested
it
was
felt
that
it
would
be
a
retrograde
step
if
the
customs
were
taken
out
of
the
control
of
sir
robert
hart
who
had
been
since
of
the
customs
the
british
secretary
of
state
for
foreign
affairs
sir
edward
grey
at
once
protested
against
the
decree
of
the
of
may
pointing
out
that
the
continuation
of
the
established
system
had
been
stipulated
for
in
the
loan
agreements
of
and
as
a
result
of
this
and
other
representations
the
board
of
control
of
the
customs
was
late
in
made
a
department
of
the
board
of
finance
the
chinese
continued
in
office
and
despite
the
assurances
given
to
great
britain
by
china
in
a
note
of
the
of
june
that
the
appointment
of
the
was
not
intended
to
interfere
with
the
established
system
of
administration
the
absolute
authority
of
sir
robert
hart
was
weakened
sir
robert
hart
returned
to
england
in
on
leave
of
absence
sir
robert
bredon
the
deputy
being
placed
in
charge
of
the
service
under
the
authority
of
the
board
of
control
of
which
on
the
of
april
it
was
announced
that
he
had
been
appointed
a
member
this
step
was
viewed
with
disfavour
by
the
british
government
for
unless
sir
robert
bredon
post
was
to
be
merely
a
sinecure
it
imposed
two
masters
on
the
maritime
customs
on
the
of
april
sir
robert
bredon
severed
his
connexion
with
the
board
of
control
at
the
same
time
mr
aglen
the
commissioner
of
customs
at
hankow
became
acting
inspector
general
sir
robert
hart
being
still
nominally
head
of
the
service
the
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
chinese
to
control
the
customs
was
evidence
of
the
strength
of
the
young
china
or
recovery
of
rights
party
the
party
which
aspired
to
break
all
the
chains
such
as
which
stamped
the
country
as
not
the
equal
of
the
other
great
nations
the
agitation
in
the
steps
taken
to
suppress
opium
smoking
evidence
was
forthcoming
of
the
earnestness
with
which
the
governing
body
in
china
sought
to
better
the
condition
of
the
people
opium
smoking
followed
in
china
the
introduction
of
tobacco
smoking
and
is
stated
to
have
been
introduced
from
java
and
formosa
in
the
early
part
of
the
century
the
first
edict
against
the
habit
was
issued
in
at
that
time
the
only
foreign
opium
introduced
was
by
the
portuguese
from
goa
who
exported
about
chests
a
year
in
english
merchants
in
india
entered
into
the
trade
which
in
was
taken
over
by
the
east
india
company
the
import
in
being
over
chests
in
the
importation
of
foreign
opium
was
declared
contraband
and
between
and
the
central
government
attempted
without
success
to
suppress
the
trade
it
was
legalized
in
after
the
second
opium
war
with
great
britain
at
that
time
the
poppy
was
extensively
grown
in
china
and
the
bulk
of
the
opium
smoked
was
and
continued
to
be
of
home
manufacture
but
after
the
importation
of
opium
from
india
greatly
increased
opium
was
also
imported
from
persia
chiefly
to
formosa
which
in
passed
into
the
possession
of
japan
the
total
foreign
import
in
was
some
piculs
in
it
was
piculs
but
in
had
fallen
to
piculs
the
number
of
opium
smokers
in
china
in
the
early
years
of
the
century
was
estimated
at
from
to
millions
the
evil
effects
of
opium
smoking
were
fully
recognized
and
chang
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
the
opponents
of
the
habit
was
high
in
the
councils
of
the
on
the
of
september
an
edict
was
issued
directing
that
the
growth
sale
and
consumption
of
opium
should
cease
in
china
within
ten
years
and
ordering
the
officials
to
take
measures
to
execute
the
imperial
will
the
measures
promulgated
in
november
following
made
the
following
provisions
the
cultivation
of

to
be
restricted
annually
by
of
its
existing
area
all
persons

registered
all
shops
selling
opium
to
be

all

practice
within
six
months
societies

to
set
an
example
to
the
people
and
all
officials
under
sixty
were
required
to
abandon
opium
smoking
within
six
months
or
to
withdraw
from
the
service
of
the
state
it
was
estimated
that
the
suppression
of
opium
smoking
would
entail
a
yearly
loss
of
revenue
of
over
a
loss
about
equally
divided
between
the
central
and
provincial
governments
the
first
step
taken
to
enforce
the
edict
was
the
closing
of
the
opium
dens
in
peking
on
the
last
day
of
during
the
opium
dens
in
shanghai
canton
and
many
other
large
cities
were
closed
and
restrictions
on
the
issue
of
licences
were
introduced
in
the
foreign
settlements
even
the
eunuchs
of
the
palace
were
prohibited
from
smoking
opium
under
severe
penalties
the
central
government
continued
during
and
to
display
considerable
energy
in
the
suppression
of
the
use
of
opium
but
the
provincial
authorities
were
not
all
equally
energetic
it
was
noted
in
that
while
in
some
provinces
even
in
where
its
importance
tc
trade
and
commerce
and
its
use
as
currency
seemed
to
render
it
very
difficult
to
do
anything
effective
the
governor
and
officials
were
in
carrying
out
the
imperial
regulations
in
other
provinces
notably
in
and
in
the
provinces
of
the
lower
yangtsze
valley
great
supineness
was
exhibited
in
dealing
with
the
subject
lord
william
cecil
however
stated
that
travelling
in
between
peking
and
hankow
through
country
which
in
he
had
seen
covered
with
the
poppy
he
could
not
then
see
a
single
poppy
flower
and
that
going
up
the
yangtsze
he
found
only
one
small
patch
of
poppy
cultivation
the
peking
correspondent
of
in
a
journey
to
turkestan
in
the
early
part
of
found
that
in
province
the
people
desire
to
suppress
the
opium
trade
was
in
advance
of
the
views
of
the
government
every
day
trains
of
opium
carts
were
passed
travelling
under
official
protection
but
in
the
adjoining
province
of
there
had
been
complete
suppression
of
poppy
cultivation
and
in
the
officials
were
conducting
a
very
vigorous
campaign
against
the
growth
of
the
poppy
in
their
endeavours
to
suppress
opium
smoking
the
chinese
government
appealed
to
the
indian
government
for
help
and
in
received
a
promise
that
india
would
decrease
the
production
of
opium
annually
by
for
four
years
and
subsequently
if
china
did
likewise
the
indian
government
also
assented
to
indian
opium
being
taxed
equally
with
chinese
opium
but
china
did
not
raise
the
duty
on
foreign
opium
in
the
indian
government
undertook
to
reduce
the
amount
of
opium
exported
by
chests
yearly
in
the
same
year
the
opium
dens
in
were
closed
in
february
on
the
initiative
of
the
united
states
an
international
conference
was
held
at
shanghai
to
consider
the
opium
trade
and
habit
at
this
conference
the
chinese
representative
claimed
that
the
consumption
of
opium
had
already
been
reduced
by
a
claim
not
borne
out
by
the
ascertained
facts
the
conference
was
unable
to
suggest
any
heroic
measures
but
a
number
of
proposals
were
agreed
to
including
the
closing
of
opium
dens
in
the
foreign
settlements
tending
to
the
restriction
of
the
opium
trade
the
conference
also
dealt
with
another
and
growing
habit
in
china
the
use
of
morphia
japan
agreed
to
prohibit
the
export
of
morphia
to
china
a
prohibition
to
which
the
other
powers
had
previously
agreed
education
the
attempts
to
reform
the
educational
system
of
china
on
a
comprehensive
scale
date
from
the
year
of
the
return
of
the
court
to
peking
after
the
boxer
troubles
in
regulations
were
sanctioned
by
the
emperor
which
aimed
at
remodelling
the
methods
of
public
instruction
these
regulations
provided
among
other
things
for
the
establishment
at
peking
of
a
university
giving
instruction
in
western
learning
a
technical
college
and
a
special
department
for
training
officials
and
teachers
a
much
more
revolutionary
step
was
taken
in
september
when
a
decree
appeared
announcing
as
from
the
beginning
of
the
abolition
of
the
existing
method
of
examinations
the
new
system
was
to
include
the
study
of
modern
sciences
history
geography
and
foreign
languages
and
in
the
higher
grades
political
economy
and
civil
and
international
law
thousands
of
temples
were
converted
to
educational
purposes
in
canton
in
the
old
examination
hall
was
demolished
to
make
way
for
a
college
with
every
appliance
on
western
lines
equal
zeal
was
noticeable
in
such
conservative
cities
as
and
in
remote
provinces
like
by
may
fifteen
universities
had
been
founded
moreover
many
young
chinese
went
abroad
to
acquire
education
in
japan
alone
in
there
were
students
in
the
same
year
primary
schools
for
girls
were
established
perhaps
the
most
striking
evidence
of
the
new
spirit
regarding
education
was
the
tenour
of
a
communication
to
the
throne
from
the
head
of
the
confucian
family
on
the
of
december
an
imperial
edict
had
appeared
raising
confucius
to
the
same
rank
as
heaven
and
earth
an
action
taken
to
indicate
the
desire
of
the
government
to
emphasize
the
value
of
ethical
training
in
thanking
the
throne
for
the
honour
conferred
on
his
ancestor
the
head
of
the
family
urged
that
at
the
new
college
founded
at
the
of
confucius
the
teaching
should
include
foreign
languages
physical
culture
political
science
and
military
drill
while
china
with
the
consent
of
the
emperor
and
the
and
under
the
guidance
of
prince
ching
yuan
and
chang
was
endeavouring
to
bring
about
internal
reforms
her
attitude
to
foreign
powers
was
one
of
reserve
and
distrust
this
was
especially
marked
in
the
negotiations
with
japan
and
with
russia
concerning
manchuria
and
was
seen
also
in
the
negotiations
with
great
britain
concerning
tibet
it
was
not
until
april
after
four
years
negotiations
that
a
convention
with
great
britain
respecting
tibet
was
signed
chinese
suzerain
rights
being
respected
in
september
the
dalai
lama
arrived
in
peking
from
mongolia
and
was
received
by
the
emperor
who
also
gave
audience
to
a
nepalese
mission
death
of
the
emperor
and
of
the
dowager
empress
the
emperor
had
witnessed
without
being
able
to
guide
the
new
reform
movement
in
august
an
edict
was
issued
in
his
name
announcing
the
convocation
of
a
parliament
in
nine
years
time
in
november
he
died
his
death
occasioned
no
surprise
as
disquieting
reports
about
his
health
had
been
current
since
july
but
the
announcement
that
the
dowager
empress
died
on
the
of
november
the
day
after
that
on
which
the
emperor
was
officially
stated
to
have
died
was
totally
unexpected
she
had
celebrated
her
birthday
on
the
of
november
and
appeared
then
to
be
in
good
health
the
empress
dowager
had
taken
part
in
the
choice
of
a
successor
to
the
throne
valedictory
edict
had
been
drawn
up
under
her
supervision
and
it
is
believed
that
the
emperor
died
some
days
previous
to
the
date
officially
given
for
his
death
died
childless
and
was
succeeded
by
his
infant
nephew
born
on
the
of
february
a
son
of
prince
chun
who
was
appointed
regent
prince
chun
himself
then
only
years
old
had
exercised
considerable
influence
at
court
since
his
mission
to
germany
in
and
was
one
of
the
most
enlightened
of
the
manchu
princes
the
death
of
the
dowager
empress
removed
a
powerful
obstacle
to
a
reformed
regime
and
with
her
passed
away
the
last
prominent
representative
of
the
old
era
in
china
accession
of
hsuan
tung
the
accession
to
the
throne
of
who
was
given
as
reigning
title
hsuan
tung
promulgating
universally
was
unaccompanied
by
disturbances
save
for
an
outbreak
at
easily
suppressed
prince
chun
had
the
support
of
yuan
and
chang
the
two
most
prominent
chinese
members
of
the
government
at
peking
and
thus
a
division
between
the
manchus
and
chinese
was
avoided
on
the
of
december
the
young
emperor
was
enthroned
with
the
usual
rites
on
the
day
following
another
edict
which
it
was
stated
had
had
the
approval
of
the
late
dowager
empress
was
issued
reaffirming
that
of
the
of
august
regarding
the
grant
of
a
parliamentary
constitution
in
nine
years
time
and
urging
the
people
to
prepare
themselves
for
the
change
other
edicts
sought
to
strengthen
the
position
of
the
regent
as
emperor
yuan
and
chang
received
the
title
of
grand
guardians
of
the
heir
and
the
year
closed
with
the
chief
chinese
members
of
the
government
working
apparently
in
complete
harmony
with
the
regent
dismissal
of
yuan
agreement
with
japan
on
the
of
january
however
the
political
situation
was
rudely
disturbed
by
the
dismissal
from
office
of
yuan
this
step
led
to
representations
by
the
british
and
american
ministers
to
prince
ching
the
head
of
the
foreign
office
by
whom
assurances
were
given
that
no
change
of
policy
was
contemplated
by
china
while
the
regent
in
a
letter
to
president
taft
reiterated
the
determination
of
his
government
to
carry
through
its
reform
policy
the
dismissal
of
yuan
was
believed
by
the
chinese
to
be
due
to
his
betrayal
of
the
emperor
in
the
reform
movement
he
had
nevertheless
refused
to
go
to
extremes
on
the
reactionary
side
and
in
as
governor
of
he
preserved
a
neutrality
which
greatly
facilitated
the
relief
of
the
peking
legations
during
the
last
years
of
the
life
of
the
dowager
empress
it
was
his
influence
which
largely
reconciled
her
to
the
new
reform
movement
yet
had
not
forgotten
the
of
and
it
is
alleged
that
he
left
a
testament
calling
upon
his
brother
the
prince
regent
to
avenge
the
wrongs
he
had
suffered
during
the
greater
part
of
the
year
there
was
serious
estrangement
between
china
and
japan
but
on
the
of
september
a
convention
was
signed
which
settled
most
of
the
points
in
dispute
respecting
manchuria
and
korea
in
korea
the
boundary
was
adjusted
so
that
chientao
a
mountainous
district
in
eastern
manchuria
regarded
as
the
ancestral
home
of
the
reigning
families
of
china
and
korea
was
definitely
assigned
to
china
while
in
manchuria
both
as
to
railways
and
mines
a
policy
of
was
substituted
for
one
of
opposition
although
japan
had
made
substantial
concessions
those
made
by
china
in
return
provoked
loud
complaints
from
the
southern
provinces
the
society
calling
for
the
dismissal
of
prince
ching
in
northern
manchuria
the
russian
authorities
had
assumed
territorial
jurisdiction
at
harbin
but
on
the
of
may
an
agreement
was
signed
recognizing
chinese
jurisdiction
the
control
of
railways
the
spirit
typified
by
the
cry
of
china
for
the
chinese
was
seen
actively
at
work
in
the
determined
efforts
made
to
exclude
foreign
capital
from
railway
affairs
the
completion
in
october
of
the
railway
was
the
cause
of
much
patriotic
rejoicing
the
railway
a
purely
chinese
undertaking
is
long
and
took
four
years
to
build
it
traversed
difficult
country
piercing
the
nan
pass
by
four
tunnels
one
under
the
great
wall
being
long
there
was
much
controversy
between
foreign
financiers
generally
backed
by
their
respective
governments
as
to
the
construction
of
other
lines
in
march
the
deutschasiatische
bank
secured
a
loan
of
for
the
construction
of
the
railway
this
concession
was
contrary
to
an
undertaking
given
in
to
british
firms
and
was
withdrawn
but
only
in
return
for
the
admittance
of
german
capital
in
the
railway
after
prolonged
negotiations
an
agreement
was
signed
in
paris
on
the
of
may
for
a
loan
of
for
the
construction
of
the
railway
from
hankow
to
in
which
british
french
german
and
american
interests
were
equally
represented
in
january
the
french
line
from
hanoi
to
was
opened
the
railway
from
shanghai
to
nanking
was
opened
for
through
traffic
in
provincial
assemblies
constituted
a
senate
formed
the
progress
of
the
movement
and
the
dispute
over
the
control
of
the
imperial
maritime
customs
have
already
been
chronicled
a
notable
step
was
taken
in
by
the
institution
of
elected
assemblies
in
each
of
the
provinces
the
franchise
on
which
the
members
were
elected
was
very
limited
and
the
assemblies
were
given
consultative
powers
only
they
were
opened
on
the
of
october
the
day
of
the
moon
the
businesslike
manner
in
which
these
assemblies
conducted
their
work
was
a
matter
of
general
comment
among
foreign
observers
in
china
in
february
decrees
appeared
approving
schemes
drawn
up
by
the
commission
for
constitutional
reforms
providing
for
local
government
in
prefectures
and
departments
and
for
the
reform
of
the
judiciary
this
was
followed
on
the
of
may
by
another
decree
summoning
the
senate
to
meet
for
the
first
time
on
the
day
of
the
moon
the
of
october
all
the
members
of
the
senate
were
nominated
and
the
majority
were
manchus
neither
to
the
provincial
assemblies
nor
to
the
senate
was
any
power
of
the
purse
given
and
the
drawing
up
of
a
budget
was
postponed
until
movements
riots
in
the
efforts
of
the
central
government
to
increase
the
efficiency
of
the
army
and
to
a
navy
were
continued
in
china
was
credited
with
the
intention
of
spending
on
the
rehabilitation
of
its
naval
and
military
forces
it
was
estimated
in
march
that
there
were
about
men
but
their
independent
spirit
and
disaffection
constituted
a
danger
to
internal
peace
the
danger
was
accentuated
by
the
mutual
jealousy
of
the
central
and
provincial
governments
the
agitation
moreover
again
seemed
to
be
growing
in
strength
in
april
there
was
serious
rioting
at
changsha
a
town
whence
a
few
years
previously
had
issued
a
quantity
of
literature
of
a
vile
kind
the
immediate
causes
of
the
riots
seem
to
have
been
many
rumours
of
the
intention
of
the
foreign
powers
to
dismember
china
the
establishment
of
foreign
firms
at
changsha
competing
with
native
firms
and
exporting
rice
and
salt
at
a
time
when
the
province
was
suffering
from
famine
and
the
approach
of
halley
comet
probably
famine
precipitated
the
outbreak
which
was
easily
crushed
as
was
also
a
rising
in
may
at
yung
chow
a
town
in
the
south
of
much
mission
and
mercantile
property
was
wrecked
at
changsha
but
the
only
loss
of
life
was
the
accidental
drowning
of
three
roman
catholic
priests
the
regent
policy
an
edict
of
the
of
august
effected
considerable
and
unexpected
changes
in
the
personnel
of
the
central
government
tang
a
former
lieutenant
of
yuan
was
appointed
president
of
the
board
of
communications
and
to
him
fell
the
difficult
task
of
reconciling
chinese
and
foreign
interests
in
the
development
of
the
railway
system
sheng
regarded
as
the
chief
chinese
authority
on
currency
questions
and
an
advocate
of
the
adoption
of
a
gold
standard
was
attached
to
the
board
of
finance
to
help
in
the
reforms
decreed
by
an
edict
of
may
of
the
same
year
see
ante
the
issue
of
the
edict
was
attributed
to
the
influence
with
the
regent
of
prince
who
had
recently
returned
from
a
tour
in
europe
where
he
had
specially
studied
questions
of
national
defence
the
changes
made
among
the
high
officials
tended
greatly
to
strengthen
the
central
administration
the
government
had
viewed
with
some
disquiet
the
agreement
of
the
of
july
concerning
manchuria
which
was
generally
interpreted
as
in
fact
lessening
the
authority
of
china
in
that
country
it
had
become
involved
in
another
dispute
with
great
britain
which
regarded
some
of
the
measures
taken
to
suppress
opium
smoking
as
a
violation
of
the
terms
of
the
chifu
convention
and
its
action
in
tibet
had
caused
alarm
in
india
thus
the
appointment
to
high
office
of
men
of
enlightenment
pledged
to
a
reform
policy
was
calculated
to
restore
confidence
in
the
policy
of
the
peking
authorities
this
confidence
would
have
been
greater
had
not
the
changes
indicated
a
struggle
for
supreme
power
between
the
regent
and
the
dowager
empress
lung
yu
widow
of
the
strength
of
the
various
movements
at
work
throughout
china
was
at
this
time
extremely
difficult
to
gauge
the
intensity
of
the
desire
for
the
acquisition
of
western
knowledge
was
equalled
by
the
desire
to
secure
the
independence
of
the
country
from
foreign
control
the
second
of
these
desires
gave
the
force
it
possessed
to
the
movement
at
the
same
time
some
of
the
firmest
supporters
of
reform
were
found
among
the
manchus
nor
did
there
seem
to
be
any
reason
to
doubt
the
intention
of
the
regent
if
he
retained
power
to
guide
the
nation
through
the
troubled
period
of
transition
into
an
era
of
constitutional
government
and
the
full
development
of
the
resources
of
the
empire

bibliographical
knowledge
of
the
ancient
history
of
china
is
necessarily
derived
from
the
native
writers
on
the
subject
fortunately
the
chinese
have
always
regarded
the
preservation
of
the
national
records
as
a
matter
of
supreme
importance
confucius
set
an
example
in
this
respect
and

preserved
for
us

past
and
then

centuries
the
celebrated
emperor
shih
in
establishing
the
empire
attempted
to
strengthen
his
cause
by
destroying
all
works
on
the
national
history
but
so
strongly
was
the
historical
sense
inculcated
in
the
people
that
immediately
on
the
death
of
the
tyrant
the
nation
records
were
again
brought
to
light
and
have
been
carefully
preserved
and
edited

that
time

for
students
the
stores
of
historical
knowledge
which
were
at
the
command
of
confucius
and
european
writers
on
chinese
history
have
found
in
the

a
source

valuable

it

chinese
art
painting
is
the
art
of
china
which
can
boast
of
a
succession
of
great
painters
for
at
least
twelve
centuries
though
the
chinese
have
an
instinctive
gift
for
harmonious
colour
their
painting
is
above
all
an
art
of
it
is
intimately
connected
with
writing
itself
a
fine
art
demanding
the
same
skill
and
supple
power
in
the
wielding
of
the
brush
the
most
typical
expression
of
the
chinese
genius
in
painting
is
the
ink
sketch
such
as
the
masters
of
the
sung
dynasty
most
preferred
and
the
japanese
from
the
century
adopted
for
an
abiding
model
utmost
vigour
of
stroke
was
here
combined
with
utmost
delicacy
of
modulation
rich
colour
and
the
use
of
gold
are
an
integral
part
of
the
buddhist
pictures
though
in
the
masterpieces
of
the
religious
painters
a
grand
rhythm
of
linear
design
gives
the
fundamental
character
exquisite
subdued
colour
is
also
found
in
the
flower
and
bird
pieces
and
subjects
of
the
sung
artists
and
becomes
more
emphatic
and
variegated
in
the
decorative
artists
of
the
ming
period
not
to
represent
facts
but
to
suggest
a
poetic
idea
often
perfumed
so
to
speak
with
reminiscence
of
some
actual
poem
has
ever
been
the
chinese
artist
aim
a
picture
is
a
voiceless
poem
is
an
old
saying
in
china
where
very
frequently
the
artist
was
a
literary
man
by
profession
oriental
critics
lay
more
stress
on
loftiness
of
sentiment
and
tone
than
on
technical
qualities
this
idealist
temper
helps
to
explain
the
deliberate
avoidance
of
all
emphasis
on
appearances
of
material
solidity
by
means
of
chiaroscuro
and
the
exclusive
use
of
the
light
medium
of
the
chinese
express
actual
dislike
for
the
representation
of
relief
whoever
compares
the
painting
of
europe
with
that
of
asia
and
chinese
painting
is
the
central
type
for
the
one
continent
as
italian
may
claim
to
be
for
the
other
must
first
understand
this
contrast
of
aim
the
limitations
of
the
chinese
are
great
but
these
limitations
save
them
from
mistaking
advances
in
science
for
advances
in
art
and
from
petty
imitation
of
fact
their
religious
painting
has
great
affinity
with
the
early
religious
art
of
italy
that
of
siena
but
the
ideas
of
the
renaissance
its
scientific
curiosity
its
materialism
its
glorification
of
human
personality
are
wholly
missing
in
china
for
europe
man
is
ever
the
hero
and
the
foreground
hence
the
dominant
study
of
the
nude
and
the
tendency
to
thronged
compositions
with
dramatic
motives
of
effort
and
conflict
the
chinese
artists
weak
in
the
plastic
weak
in
the
architectural
sense
paint
mostly
in
a
lyric
mood
with
a
contemplative
ideal
hence
the
value
given
to
space
in
their
designs
the
passion
for
nature
and
the
supremacy
of
landscape
beauty
is
found
not
only
in
pleasant
prospects
but
in
wild
solitudes
rain
snow
and
storm
the
life
of
things
is
contemplated
and
portrayed
for
its
own
sake
not
for
its
uses
in
the
life
of
men
from
this
point
of
view
the
body
of
chinese
painting
is
much
more
modern
in
conception
than
that
of
western
art
landscape
was
a
mature
and
free
art
in
china
more
than
a
thousand
years
ago
and
her
school
of
landscape
is
the
loftiest
yet
known
to
the
world
nor
was
man
ever
dissociated
from
nature
as
early
as
the
century
ku
says
that
in
painting
a
certain
noble
character
he
must
give
him
a
fit
background
of
great
peaks
and
deep
ravines
chinese
painting
in
sum
finely
complements
rather
than
poorly
supplements
that
of
europe
where
the
latter
is
strong
it
is
weak
but
in
certain
chosen
provinces
it
long
ago
found
consummate
expression
for
thoughts
and
feelings
scarcely
yet
expressed

us
history

the
origin
of
chinese
painting

lost
in
legend
though
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
its
great
antiquity

in
literature
prove
that
by
the
century
it
was
a

ascribed
the

history
and
portraiture
seem
to
have
been
the
prevailing
subjects
a
secular
art

to
the
social
ideals
of
confucianism
yet
long
before
the
introduction
of
buddhism
with
its
images
and

we
find
that
the
two
great
symbolic
figures
of
the
chinese
imagination
the
tiger
and
the
dragon
typifying
the
forces
of
nature
and
the
power
of
the
spirit
had
been
evolved
in
art
and
to
imaginative
minds
the
mystic
ideas
of
lao
tzü
and
the
legends
of
his
hermit
followers
proved
a
fruitful
field
for
artistic
motives
of
a
kind
which

was
still
more
to
enrich
and
multiply

classifications

according
to
native
historians
the
art
of
printing
from
wooden
blocks
was
invented
in
china
in
the
century
when
it
was
employed
for
the
publication
of
texts
the
earliest
evidence
we
have
for
the
existence
of
woodcuts
made
to
reproduce
pictures
or
drawings
is
a
passage
in
a
work
by
chang
from
which
it
appears
that
these
were
not
made
before
the
beginning
of
the
dynasty
under
which
that
author
lived
the
method
employed
was
to
cut
the
design
with
a
knife
on
the
plank
of
the
wood
in
the
manner
followed
by
european
artists
till
the
end
of
the
century
when
engraving
with
a
burin
on
boxwood
ousted
the
older
process
the
japanese
borrowed
the
art
from
china
and
in
japan
a
whole
school
of
artists
arose
who
worked
specially
for
the
woodcutters
and
adapted
their
designs
to
the
limitations
of
the
material
employed
in
china
the
art
has
remained
merely
reproductive
and
its
history
is
therefore
of
less
interest

known
to
the
chinese
in
the
century
and
probably
earlier

the
british

nothing

and
some

the
chinese
genius
has
found
but
limited
and
uncongenial
expression
a
nation
of
painters
has
built
picturesquely
but
this
picturesqueness
has
fought
against
the
attainment
of
the
finest
architectural
qualities
there
has
been
little
development
the
arch
for
instance
though
known
to
the
chinese
from
very
early
times
has
been
scarcely
used
as
a
principle
of
design
and
the
cupola
has
been
undiscovered
or
ignored
and
though
foreign
architectural
ideas
were
introduced
under
the
influence
of
the
buddhist
and
mahommedan
religions
these
were
more
or
less
assimilated
and
subdued
to
the
dominant
chinese
design
ruins
scarcely
exist
and
no
building
earlier
than
the
century
is
known
but
we
know
from
records
that
the
forms
of
architecture
still
prevalent
imitate
in
essentials
those
of
the
and
centuries
and
doubtless
represent
an
immemorial
tradition
the
grand
characteristic
of
chinese
architecture
is
the
importance
of
the
roof
the
is
the
commonest
model
of
building
the
roof
is
the
main
feature
in
fact
the
consists
of
this
roof
massive
and
immense
with
recurved
edges
and
the
numerous
short
columns
on
which
the
roof
rests
the
columns
are
of
wood
the
straight
stems
of
the
being
specially
used
for
this
purpose
the
walls
are
not
supports
but
merely
fill
in
with
stone
or
brickwork
the
spaces
between
the
columns
the
scheme
of
construction
is
thus
curiously
like
that
of
the
modern
american
building
though
the
external
form
may
be
derived
from
the
tent
of
primitive
nomads
the
roof
being
the
preponderant
feature
is
that
on
which
the
art
of
the
architect
has
been
concentrated
a
double
or
a
triple
roof
may
be
devised
the
ridges
and
eaves
may
be
decorated
with
dragons
and
other
fantastic
animals
and
the
eaves
underlaid
with
carved
and
lacquered
woodwork
the
roof
itself
is
often
covered
with
glazed
tiles
of
brilliant
hue
in
spite
of
efforts
sometimes
desperate
to
give
variety
and
individual
character
by
ornament
and
detail
the
general
impression
is
one
of
poverty
of
design
chinese
buildings
are
usually
and
are
developed
horizontally
as
they
are
increased
in
size
or
number
the
principle
which
determines
the
plan
of
projection
is
that
of
symmetry
bushell
all
important
buildings
must
face
the
south
and
this
uniform
orientation
increases
the
general
architectural
monotony
produced
by
a
preponderance
of
horizontal
lines
a
special
characteristic
of
chinese
architecture
is
the
an
archway
erected
only
by
special
authority
usually
to
commemorate
famous
persons
the
is
commonly
made
of
wood
with
a
tiled
roof
but
sometimes
is
built
entirely
of
stone
as
is
the
gateway
at
the
avenue
of
the
ming
tombs
a
magnificent
example
of
the
is
that
on
the
avenue
leading
to

the
temple
of
the
sleeping
buddha
near

this

and

the

the
japanese

its
origin
from
the
of
indian
lofty
towers
called
usually
square
and
of
stone
seem
to
have
been
a
common
type
of
important
building
in
early
times
they
are
described
in
old
books
as
erected
by
the
ancient
kings
and
used
for
various
purposes
the
towers
of
the

are
of
the
same
character
and
are
made
of
stone
with
arched
doors
and

stone
though
plentiful
in
most
provinces
of
the
empire
has
been
singularly
little
used
by
the
chinese
who
prefer
wood
or

paléologue
attributes
this
preference
of
light
and
destructible
materials
to
the

on
the
general
model
the
temple
of

is
the
most
imposing
of
the
confucian
temples
conspicuous
with
its
covering
of
tiles
and
its
triple
roof
near
this
is
the
great
altar
of

consisting
of
three
circular
terraces
with

buddhist
temples
are
built
on
the
general
plan
of
secular
residences
and
consist
of
a
series
of
rectangular
courts
with
the
principal
building
in
the
centre
the
lesser

the

lama
temples
differ
little
from
these
except
in
the
interior
decorations
and

mahommedan
mosques
are
far
simpler
and
severer
in
internal
arrangement
but
outwardly
these
also
are
in
the
chinese
style
the
chinese
the
type
of
chinese
architecture
most
familiar
to
the
west
probably
owes
its
peculiar
form
to
buddhist
influence
in
the
pagoda
alone
may
be
found
some
trace
of
a
religious
imagination
such
as
in
europe
made
gothic
architecture
so
full
and
splendid
an
expression
of
the
aspiring
spirit
the
most
famous
pagoda
was
the
porcelain
tower
of

destroyed
by
the
rebels
in
this
was
covered
with
slabs
of

except
in

the
chinese
have
not
obtained
distinction
as
sculptors

of

lack
the
true

and
though
the
power
of
the
chinese
draughtsmen
increased
rapidly
under
the
and
sung
dynasties
their
work
in
stone
showed
no
parallel
progress
the
feeling
for
solidity
which
in
japan
was
a
natural
growth
was
always
somewhat
exotic
in
china
with
the
impulse
given
to
the
arts
by
buddhism

of

chinese
type
in

colossal

little
however

of
these
earlier

and
such
true
sculpture

wood

as
we

from

hindu
in
style
though
not
without
elements
of
breadth
and
strength
which
seem
to
promise
a
greater
development
than
actually
took
place
the
colossal
figures
guarding
the
approach
to
the
ming
tombs
century
show
that
the
national
taste
rapidly
became
conventional
and
petrified
so
far
as
monumental
sculpture
was
concerned
though
occasional
examples
of
devotional
or
portrait
sculpture
on
a
smaller
scale
in
wood
and
ivory
are
found
which
in
power
grace
sincerity
and
restraint
can
rank
with
the
work
of
more
gifted
nations
such
pieces
however
are
extremely
rare
and
at
south
kensington
the
ivory
kwanyin
and
child
is
a
solitary
example
as
a
rule
the
chinese
sculptor
valued
his
art
in
proportion
to
the
technical
difficulties
it
conquered
he
thus
either
preferred
intractable
materials
like
jade
or
or
if
he
wrought
in
wood
horn
or
ivory
sought
to
make
his
work
curious
or
intricate
rather
than
beautiful
there
is
nevertheless
beauty
of
a
kind
in
chinese
bowls
of
jade
and
there
is
dignity
in
some
of
the
pieces
of
but
the
bulk
of
the
carving
done
in
wood
horn
and
ivory
does
not
deserve
a
moment
serious
thought
from
the
aesthetic
point
of
view
the
few
fine
specimens
may
be
referred
to
the
earlier
part
of
the
ming
dynasty
when
chinese
art
in
general
was
sincere
and
simple
after
the
middle
of
the
century
there
set
in
the
taste
for
profuse
ornament
which
injured
all
subsequent
chinese
work
and
wholly
ruined
chinese
sculpture
in
chinese
bronzes
we
have
a
more
consistent
and
exceptional
form
of
plastic
art
which
can
be
traced
continuously
for
some
three
thousand
years
these
bronzes
take
the
form
of
ritual
or
honorific
vessels
and
the
archaic
shapes
used
in
the
service
of
the
prehistoric
religion
of
the
country
are
repeated
and
copied
with
slight
changes
in
decoration
or
detail
to
the
present
day
the
oldest
extant
specimens
chiefly
derived
from
the
sack
of
the
summer
palace
at
peking
may
be
referred
to
the
shang
and
chow
dynasties
these
ancient
pieces
have
a
certain
savage
monumental
grandeur
of
design
are
usually
covered
with
a
rich
and
thick
patina
of
red
green
and
brown
and
are
decorated
with
simple
patterns
scrolls
zigzag
lines
and
a
form
of
what
is
known
as
the
greek
symbolizing
respectively
waves
mountains
and
storm
clouds
the
animal
forms
used
are
those
of
the
glutton
a
fabulous
monster
possibly
a
conventionalized
tiger
representing
the
powers
of
the
earth
the
serpent
and
the
bull
these
two
last
in
later
pieces
combine
to
form
the
dragon

in

also
made

be
contrasted
the

a

the

now
become
perfect
yet
the
menacing
majestic
feeling
remains
we
see
it
no
less
clearly
in

a
marvellous
vessel
richly
inlaid
with
gold
and
silver
and
covered
with
an
patina
it
may
date
from
about
and
indicates
that
even
in
this
remote
epoch
the
chinese
were
not
only
daring
and
powerful
artists
but
also
in
metal
it
is
indeed
at
this
period
that
the
art
reaches
its
climax
the
monumental
grandeur
of
the
shang
specimens
is
often
allied
to
clumsiness
the
later
work
if
more
elaborate
is
always
less
powerful
nevertheless
it
is
to
a
later
period
that
out
of
a
hundred
chinese
bronzes
must
be
referred
and
the
great
majority
belong
either
to
the
han
and
succeeding
dynasties
or
to
the
renaissance
of
the
arts
which
culminated
under
the
ming
dynasty
a
thousand
years
later
the
characteristics
of
the
first
of
these
periods
is
the
free
use
of
small
solid
figures
of
animals
as
decoration
the
phoenix
the
elephant
the
frog
the
ox
the
tortoise
and
occasionally
men
shapes
grow
less
austere
and
less
significant
as
a
comparison
between
figures
and
will
indicate
then
towards
the
end
of
the
century
the
influence
of
buddhism
is
felt
in
the
general
tendency
towards
suavity
of
form
fig
this
vase
is
most
delicately
though
sparingly
inlaid
with
silver
and
a
few
touches
of
gold
some
small
pieces
very
richly
and
delicately
inlaid
and
covered
with
a
magnificent
patina
belonging
to
this
period
form
a
connecting
link
between
the
inlaid
work
of
the
chow
dynasty
and
that
of
the
sung
and
ming
dynasties
the
mirrors
with
designs
a
conclusive
proof
of
the
external
influences
brought
to
bear
upon
chinese
art
are
also
attributed
to
the
han
epoch
the
troubled
period
between
and
in
spite
of
the
interval
of
activity
under
the
dynasty
produced
it
would
seem
but
few
bronzes
and
those
few
were
of
no
distinct
or
noteworthy
style
under
the
sung
dynasty
the
arts
revived
and
to
this
time
some
of
the
most
splendid
specimens
of
inlaid
work
belong
pieces
of
workmanship
and
taste
no
less
perfect
than
that
of
the
japanese
in
which
the
gold
and
silver
of
the
earlier
work
are
occasionally
reinforced
with
malachite
and
the
coming
of
kublai
khan
and
the
yuen
dynasty
once
more
brought
the
east
into
contact
with
the
west
and
to
this
time
we
may
assign
certain
fine
pieces
of
persian
form
such
as
pilgrim
bottles
the
vessels
bearing
arabic
inscriptions
belong
to
the
ming
dynasty
with
which
the
modern
history
of
chinese
art
begins
the
work
done
while
the
ming
dynasty
was
still
young
provides
the
student
of
chinese
art
with
many
problems
and
in
one
or
two
cases
even
the
south
kensington
authorities
assign
to
times
pieces
that
are
clearly
of
ming
workmanship
the
tendency
of
the
period
was
eclectic
and
archaistic
the
products
of
earlier
days
were
reproduced
with
perfect
technical
command
of
materials
and
with
admirable
taste
it
is
indeed
by
an
excess
of
these
qualities
that
archaistic
ming
work
may
be
distinguished
from
the
true
archaic
in
fig
we
see
how
the
ming
bronze
worker
took
an
earlier
buddhistic
form
of
vase
and
gave
it
a
new
grace
that
amounted
almost
to
artifice
a
parallel
might
be
found
among
the
products
of
the
of
in
which
old
designs
are
revived
with
just
that
added
suavity
or
profusion
of
curvature
that
robs
them
of
character
fig
again
might
be
mistaken
almost
for
a
piece
of
the
chow
dynasty
were
not
the
grandeur
of
its
form
modified
by
just
so
much
harmony
in
the
curvature
of
the
body
and
neck
and
by
just
so
much
finish
in
the
details
as
to
rob
the
design
of
the
old
majestic
vigour
and
to
mark
it
as
the
splendid
effort
of
an
age
of
culture
and
not
the
natural
product
of
a
period
of
strength
it
is
however
in
the
inlaid
pieces
that
the
difference
tells
most
clearly
here
we
find
the
monstrous
forms
of
the
shang
and
chow
dynasties
revived
by
men
who
appreciated
their
spirit
but
could
not
help
making
the
revival
an
excuse
for
the
display
of
their
own
superior
skill
the
monstrous
vases
and
of
the
past
thus
appear
once
more
but
are
now
decorated
with
a
delicate
embroidery
of
inlay
are
polished
and
finished
to
perfection
but
lose
therewith
just
the
rudeness
of
edge
and
outline
which
made
the
older
work
so
gravely
significant
at
times
even
some
grandly
planned
vessel
will
appear
with
such
a
festoon
of
pretty
tracery
wreathed
about
it
that
the
incongruity
is
little
short
of
ridiculous
and
we
recognize
we
have
passed
the
to
decline
decline
indeed
came
rapidly
and
to
the
latter
part
of
the
ming
epoch
we
must
assign
those
countless
bronzes
where
dragons
and
flowers
and
the
stock
symbols
of
happiness
good
luck
and
longevity
sprawl
together
in
interminable
convolutions
when
once
we
reach
this
stage
of
contortion
of
elaborate
pierced
and
relief
work
we
come
to
the
place
in
history
of
chinese
bronzes
where
serious
study
may
cease
except
in
so
far
as
the
study
of
the
symbols
themselves
throws
light
upon
the
history
of
chinese
procelain
see
ceramics
one
class
of
bronze
alone
needs
a
word
of
notice
namely
the
profusely
decorated
pieces
which
have
a
tibetan
origin
and
are
obviously
no
older
than
the
end
of
the
ming
period
of
these
fig
will
serve
as
a
specimen
and
a
comparison
with
fig
will
show
how
the
softer
rounded
forms
and
jewelled
festoons
of
taste
enervated
the
grand
primitive
force
of
the
earlier
age
and
that
neither
the
added
delicacy
of
texture
and
substance
nor
the
vastly
increased
dexterity
of
workmanship
can
compensate
for
the
vanished
majesty
vii
the
chinese
language
in
treating
of
chinese
it
will
be
found
convenient
to
distinguish
broadly
the
spoken
from
the
written
language
and
to
deal
with
each
separately
this
is
a
distinction
which
would
be
out
of
place
if
we
had
to
do
with
any
european
or
indeed
most
oriental
languages
writing
in
its
origin
is
merely
a
symbolic
representation
of
speech
but
in
chinese
as
we
shall
see
for
reasons
connected
with
the
peculiar
nature
ot
the
script
the
two
soon
began
to
move
along
independent
and
largely
divergent
lines
this
division
moreover
will
enable
us
to
employ
different
methods
of
inquiry
more
suited
to
each
with
regard
to
the
colloquial
it
is
hardly
possible
to
do
more
than
consider
it
in
the
form
or
forms
in
which
it
exists
at
the
present
day
throughout
the
empire
of
china
although
chinese
like
other
living
languages
must
have
undergone
gradual
changes
in
the
past
so
little
can
be
stated
with
certainty
about
these
changes
that
an
accurate
survey
of
its
evolution
is
quite
out
of
the
question
obviously
a
different
method
is
required
when
we
come
to
the
written
characters
the
familiar
line
litera
scripta
manet
volat
irrevocabile
verbum
is
truer
perhaps
of
chinese
than
of
any
other
tongue
we
have
hardly
any
clue
as
to
how
chinese
was
spoken
or
pronounced
in
any
given
district
years
ago
although
there
are
written
remains
dating
from
long
before
that
time
and
in
order
to
gain
an
insight
into
the
structure
of
the
characters
now
existing
it
is
necessary
to
trace
their
origin
and
development
the
dialects
beginning
with
the
colloquial
then
and
taking
a
linguistic
survey
of
china
we
find
not
one
spoken
language
but
a
number
of
dialects
all
clearly
of
a
common
stock
yet
differing
from
one
another
as
widely
as
the
various
romance
languages
in
southern
europe
say
french
italian
and
spanish
most
of
these
dialects
are
found
fringing
the
of
china
and
penetrating
but
a
comparatively
short
way
into
the
interior
starting
from
the
province
of
in
the
south
where
the
cantonese
and
farther
inland
the
hakka
dialects
are
spoken
and
proceeding
northwards
we
pass
in
succession
the
following
dialects
swatow
amoy
these
two
may
almost
be
regarded
as
one
foochow
wenchow
and
ningpo
farther
north
we
come
into
the
range
of
the
great
dialect
popularly
known
as
mandarin
or
official
language
which
sweeps
round
behind
the
narrow
strip
of
coast
occupied
by
the
various
dialects
and
dominates
a
hinterland
constituting
nearly
of
china
proper
mandarin
of
which
the
dialect
of
peking
the
capital
since
is
now
the
standard
form
comprises
a
considerable
number
of
some
of
them
so
closely
allied
that
the
speakers
of
one
are
wholly
intelligible
to
the
speakers
of
another
while
others
the
vernaculars
of
yangchow
hankow
or
and
ss
u
may
almost
be
considered
as
separate
dialects
among
all
these
cantonese
is
supposed
to
approximate
most
nearly
to
the
primitive
language
of
antiquity
whereas
pekingese
perhaps
has
receded
farthest
from
it
but
although
philologically
and
historically
speaking
cantonese
and
certain
other
dialects
may
be
of
greater
interest
for
all
practical
purposes
mandarin
in
the
widest
sense
of
the
term
is
by
far
the
most
important
not
only
can
it
claim
to
be
the
native
speech
of
the
majority
of
chinamen
but
it
is
the
recognized
vehicle
of
oral
communication
between
all
chinese
officials
even
in
cases
where
they
come
from
the
same
part
of
the
country
and
speak
the
same
for
these
reasons
all
examples
of
phraseology
in
this
article
will
be
given
in
pekingese
so
far
stress
has
been
laid
chiefly
on
the
dissimilarity
of
the
dialects
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
remembered
that
they
proceed
from
the
same
parent
stem
are
spoken
by
members
of
the
same
race
and
are
united
by
the
bond
of
writing
which
is
the
common
possession
of
all
and
can
not
be
regarded
as
derived
from
one
more
than
from
another
they
also
share
alike
in
the
two
most
salient
features
of
chinese
as
a
whole
they
are
all
monosyllabic
that
is
each
individual
word
consists
of
only
one
syllable
and
they
are
strikingly
poor
in
vocables
or
separate
sounds
for
the
conveyance
of
speech
the
number
of
these
vocables
varies
from
between
and
in
cantonese
to
no
more
than
in
the
vernacular
of
peking
this
scanty
number
however
is
eked
out
by
interposing
an
aspirate
between
certain
initial
consonants
and
the
vowel
so
that
for
instance
is
distinguished
from
the
latter
is
pronounced
with
little
or
no
emission
of
breath
the
p
approximating
the
farther
north
one
goes
at
niuchwang
more
closely
to
a
b
the
aspirated
is
pronounced
more
like
our
interjection
pooh
to
the
chinese
ear
the
difference
between
the
two
is
very
marked
it
will
be
found
as
a
rule
that
an
englishman
imparts
a
slight
aspirate
to
his
p
t
k
and
ch
and
therefore
has
greater
difficulty
with
the
unaspirated
words
in
chinese
the
aspirates
are
better
learned
by
the
ear
than
by
the
eye
but
in
one
way
or
another
it
is
essential
that
they
be
mastered
by
any
one
who
wishes
to
make
himself
intelligible
to
the
native
the
influence
of
the
mongolian
population
assisted
by
the
progress
of
time
has
slowly
but
surely
diminished
the
number
of
vocables
in
pekingese
thus
the
initials
and
when
followed
by
the
vowel
with
its
continental
value
have
gradually
become
softer
and
more
assimilated
to
each
other
and
are
now
all
pronounced
again
all
consonantal
endings
in
and
such
as
survive
in
cantonese
and
other
dialects
have
entirely
disappeared
from
pekingese
and
and
are
the
only
final
consonants
remaining
vowel
sounds
on
the
other
hand
have
been
proportionately
developed
such
compounds
as
ia
iao
iu
ie
occurring
with
especial
frequency
it
must
be
understood
of
course
that
the
above
are
only
equivalents
not
in
all
cases
very
exact
for
the
sounds
of
a
language
an
immediate
consequence
of
this
paucity
of
vocables
is
that
one
and
the
same
sound
has
to
do
duty
for
different
words
reckoning
the
number
of
words
that
an
educated
man
would
want
to
use
in
conversation
at
something
over
four
thousand
it
is
obvious
that
there
will
be
an
average
of
ten
meanings
to
each
sound
employed
some
sounds
may
have
fewer
meanings
attached
to
them
but
others
will
have
many
more
thus
the
following
represent
only
a
fraction
of
the
total
number
of
words
pronounced
something
like
the
shi
in
shirt
ch
history
ch
to
employ
ch
a
corpse
ch
a
market
ch
an
army
ch
a
lion
ch
to
rely
on
ch
to
wait
on
ch
poetry
ch
time
ch
to
know
ch
to
bestow
ch
to
be
ch
solid
ch
to
lose
ch
to
proclaim
ch
to
look
at
ch
ten
ch
to
pick
up
ch
stone
ch
generation
ch
to
eat
ch
a
house
ch
a
clan
ch
beginning
ch
to
let
go
ch
to
test
ch
affair
ch
power
ch
officer
ch
to
swear
ch
to
pass
away
ch
to
happen
it
would
be
manifestly
impossible
to
speak
without
ambiguity
or
indeed
to
make
oneself
intelligible
at
all
unless
there
were
some
means
of
supplementing
this
deficiency
of
sounds
as
a
matter
of
fact
several
devices
are
employed
through
the
combination
of
which
confusion
is
avoided
one
of
these
devices
is
the
coupling
of
words
in
pairs
in
order
to
express
a
single
idea
there
is
a
word
ch
which
means
elder
brother
but
in
speaking
the
sound
alone
would
not
always
be
easily
understood
in
this
sense
one
must
either
reduplicate
it
and
say
or
prefix
ch
great
and
say
simple
reduplication
is
mostly
confined
to
family
appellations
and
such
adverbial
phrases
as
ch
ch
slowly
but
there
is
a
much
larger
class
of
pairs
in
which
each
of
the
two
components
has
the
same
meaning
examples
are
ch
ch
to
be
afraid
ch
ch
to
tell
ch
ch
tree
ch
ch
skin
ch
ch
full
ch
ch
solitary
sometimes
the
two
parts
are
not
exactly
synonymous
but
together
make
up
the
sense
required
thus
in
ch
ch
clothes
denotes
more
particularly
clothes
worn
on
the
upper
part
of
the
body
and
those
on
the
lower
part
ch
ch
is
the
name
of
a
fabulous
bird
being
the
male
and
the
female
in
another
very
large
class
of
expressions
the
first
word
serves
to
limit
and
determine
the
special
meaning
of
the
second
ch
ch
cream
ch
ch
ham
ch
ch
lantern
ch
ch
strait
there
are
besides
a
number
of
phrases
which
are
harder
to
classify
thus
ch
means
tiger
but
in
any
case
where
ambiguity
might
arise
old
tiger
is
used
instead
of
the
monosyllable
ch
another
is
fox
and
ch
an
animal
belonging
to
the
smaller
cat
tribe
together
they
form
the
usual
term
for
fox
ch
ch
is
literally
to
know
the
way
but
has
come
to
be
used
simply
for
the
verb
to
know
these
pairs
or
phrases
are
of
such
frequent
occurrence
that
the
chinese
spoken
language
might
almost
be
described
as
something
similar
is
seen
in
the
extensive
use
of
suffixes
or
enclitics
attached
to
many
of
the
commonest
nouns
ch
is
the
word
for
girl
but
in
speech
ch
ch
u
or
ch
ch
is
the
form
used
ch
and
ch
both
mean
child
and
must
originally
have
been
diminutives
a
fairly
close
parallel
is
afforded
by
the
german
suffix
as
in
the
suffix
ch
it
may
be
remarked
belongs
especially
to
the
peking
vernacular
then
the
use
of
numeratives
will
often
give
some
sort
of
clue
as
to
the
class
of
objects
in
which
a
substantive
may
be
found
when
in
pidgin
english
we
speak
of
one
piecee
man
or
three
piecee
dollar
the
word
is
simply
a
chinese
numerative
in
english
dress
even
in
ordinary
english
people
do
not
say
four
cattle
but
four
of
cattle
but
in
chinese
the
use
of
numeratives
is
quite
a
distinctive
feature
of
the
language
the
commonest
of
them
ch
can
be
used
indifferently
in
connexion
with
almost
any
class
of
things
animal
vegetable
or
mineral
but
there
are
other
numeratives
at
least
or
in
everyday
use
which
are
strictly
reserved
for
limited
classes
of
things
with
specific
attributes
ch
for
instance
is
the
numerative
of
circular
objects
such
as
coins
and
rings
ch
of
small
globular
objects
pearls
grains
of
rice
ch
classifies
things
which
have
a
mouth
bags
boxes
and
so
forth
ch
is
used
of
all
kinds
of
affairs
ch
of
chairs
and
sheets
of
paper
ch
literally
half
a
pair
is
the
numerative
for
various
animals
parts
of
the
body
articles
of
clothing
and
ships
ch
for
things
which
are
grasped
by
a
handle
such
as
fans
and
knives
this
by
no
means
exhausts
the
list
of
devices
by
which
the
difficulties
of
a
monosyllabic
language
are
successfully
overcome
mention
need
only
be
made
however
of
the
system
of
tones
which
as
the
most
curious
and
important
of
all
has
been
kept
for
the
last
the
tones
the
tones
may
be
defined
as
regular
modulations
of
the
voice
by
means
of
which
different
inflections
can
be
imparted
to
the
same
sound
they
may
be
compared
with
the
modulations
which
express
emotional
feeling
in
our
words
to
the
foreign
ear
a
chinese
sentence
spoken
slowly
with
the
tones
clearly
brought
out
has
a
certain
effect
if
we
speak
of
the
tones
as
a
device
adopted
in
order
to
increase
the
number
of
vocables
this
must
be
understood
rather
as
a
convenient
way
of
explaining
their
practical
function
than
as
a
scientific
account
of
their
origin
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
the
tones
were
deliberately
invented
in
order
to
fit
each
written
character
with
a
separate
sound
a
tone
may
be
said
to
be
as
much
an
integral
part
of
the
word
to
which
it
belongs
as
the
sound
itself
like
the
sound
too
it
is
not
fixed
once
and
for
all
but
is
in
a
constant
though
very
gradual
state
of
evolution
this
fact
is
proved
by
the
great
differences
of
intonation
in
the
dialects
theoretically
four
tones
have
been
distinguished
the
even
the
rising
the
sinking
and
the
entering
each
of
which
falls
again
into
an
upper
and
a
lower
series
but
only
the
cantonese
dialect
possesses
all
these
eight
varieties
of
tone
to
which
a
ninth
has
been
added
while
pekingese
with
which
we
are
especially
concerned
here
has
no
more
than
four
the
even
upper
the
even
lower
the
rising
and
the
sinking
the
history
of
the
tones
has
yet
to
be
written
but
it
appears
that
down
to
the
century
the
only
tones
distinguished
were
the
ch
even
ch
rising
and
ch
entering
between
that
date
and
the
century
the
ch
sinking
tone
was
developed
in
the
century
the
even
tone
was
divided
into
upper
and
lower
and
a
little
later
the
entering
tone
finally
disappeared
from
pekingese
the
following
monosyllabic
dialogue
gives
a
very
fair
idea
of
the
quality
of
the
four
pekingese
tones
dead
spoken
in
a
raised
monotone
with
slightly
plaintive
inflection
dead
simple
query
dead
an
incredulous
query
long
drawn
out
dead
a
sharp
and
decisive
answer
the
native
learns
the
tones
unconsciously
and
by
ear
alone
for
centuries
their
existence
was
unsuspected
the
first
systematic
classification
of
them
being
associated
with
the
name
of
shên
yo
a
scholar
who
lived
the
emperor
wu
ti
was
inclined
to
be
sceptical
and
one
day
said
to
him
come
tell
me
what
are
these
famous
four
tones
they
are
ch
ch
ch
ch
whatever
your
majesty
pleases
to
make
them
replied
shên
yo
skilfully
selecting
for
his
answer
four
words
which
illustrated
and
in
the
usual
order
the
four
tones
in
question
although
no
native
is
ever
taught
the
tones
separately
they
are
none
the
less
present
in
the
words
he
utters
and
must
be
acquired
consciously
or
unconsciously
by
any
european
who
wishes
to
be
understood
it
is
a
mistake
however
to
imagine
that
every
single
word
in
a
sentence
must
necessarily
be
given
its
full
tonic
force
quite
a
number
of
words
such
as
the
enclitics
mentioned
above
are
not
intonated
at
all
in
others
the
degree
of
emphasis
depends
partly
on
the
tone
itself
partly
on
its
position
in
the
sentence
in
pekingese
the
tone
which
is
really
the
second
in
the
ordinary
series
the
being
subdivided
into
upper
and
lower
is
particularly
important
and
next
to
it
in
this
respect
comes
the
that
is
the
lower
even
or
division
of
the
it
may
be
said
roughly
that
any
speaker
whose
second
and
third
tones
are
correct
will
at
any
rate
be
understood
even
if
the
and
are
slurred
over
the
characters
pictorial
characters
it
is
chiefly
however
on
its
marvellous
script
and
the
rich
treasures
of
its
literature
that
the
chinese
language
depends
for
its
unique
fascination
and
charm
if
we
take
a
page
of
printed
chinese
or
carefully
written
manuscript
and
compare
it
with
a
page
say
of
arabic
or
sanskrit
the
chinese
is
seen
at
once
to
possess
a
marked
characteristic
of
its
own
it
consists
of
a
number
of
wholly
independent
units
each
of
which
would
fit
into
a
small
square
and
is
called
a
character
these
characters
are
arranged
in
columns
beginning
on
the
side
of
the
page
and
running
from
top
to
bottom
they
are
inasmuch
as
they
stand
for
articulate
sounds
expressing
but
they
are
unlike
our
words
in
that
they
are
not
composed
of
alphabetical
elements
or
letters
clearly
if
each
character
were
a
distinct
and
arbitrarily
constructed
symbol
only
those
gifted
with
exceptional
powers
of
memory
could
ever
hope
to
read
or
write
with
fluency
this
however
is
far
from
being
the
case
if
we
go
to
work
synthetically
and
first
see
how
the
language
is
built
up
it
will
soon
appear
that
most
chinese
characters
are
susceptible
of
some
kind
of
analysis
we
may
accept
as
substantially
true
the
account
of
native
writers
who
tell
us
that
means
of
communication
other
than
oral
began
with
the
use
of
knotted
cords
similar
to
the
of
ancient
mexico
and
peru
and
that
these
were
displaced
later
on
by
the
practice
of
notching
or
scoring
rude
marks
on
wood
bamboo
and
stone
it
is
beyond
question
that
the
first
four
numerals
as
written
with
simple
horizontal
strokes
date
from
this
early
period
notching
however
carries
us
but
a
little
way
on
the
road
to
a
system
of
writing
which
in
china
as
elsewhere
must
have
sprung
originally
from
pictures
in
chinese
writing
especially
the
indications
of
such
an
origin
are
unmistakable
a
few
characters
indeed
even
in
their
present
form
being
perfectly
recognizable
as
pictures
of
objects
pure
and
simple
thus
for
sun
the
ancient
chinese
drew
a
circle
with
a
dot
in
it
ch
now
modified
into
ch
for
moon
ch
now
ch
for
god
they
drew
the
anthropomorphic
figure
ch
which
in
its
modern
form
appears
as
ch
for
mountains
ch
now
ch
for
child
ch
now
ch
for
fish
ch
now
ch
for
mouth
a
round
hole
now
ch
for
hand
ch
now
ch
for
well
ch
now
written
without
the
dot
hence
we
see
that
while
the
origin
of
all
writing
is
pictographic
in
chinese
alone
of
living
languages
certain
pictures
have
survived
and
still
denote
what
they
had
denoted
in
the
beginning
in
the
script
of
other
countries
they
were
gradually
transformed
into
hieroglyphic
symbols
after
which
they
either
disappeared
altogether
or
became
further
conventionalized
into
the
letters
of
an
alphabet
these
then
accumulated
little
by
little
until
they
comprised
all
the
common
objects
which
could
be
easily
and
rapidly
delineated
sun
moon
stars
various
animals
certain
parts
of
the
body
tree
grass
and
so
forth
to
the
number
of
two
or
three
hundred
the
next
step
was
to
a
few
compound
pictograms
which
would
naturally
suggest
themselves
to
primitive
man
ch
the
sun
just
above
the
horizon
dawn
ch
trees
side
by
side
a
forest
ch
a
mouth
with
something
solid
coming
out
of
it
the
tongue
ch
a
mouth
with
vapor
or
breath
coming
out
of
it
words
suggestive
compounds
phonetic
characters
but
a
purely
pictographic
script
has
its
limitations
the
more
complex
natural
objects
hardly
come
within
its
scope
still
less
the
whole
body
of
abstract
ideas
while
writing
was
still
in
its
infancy
it
must
have
occurred
to
the
chinese
to
join
together
two
or
more
pictorial
characters
in
order
that
their
association
might
suggest
to
the
mind
some
third
thing
or
idea
sun
and
moon
combined
in
this
way
make
the
character
ch
which
means
bright
woman
and
child
make
ch
good
fields
and
strength
that
is
labour
in
the
fields
produce
the
character
ch
male
two
men
on
earth
ch
signifies
to
sit
before
chairs
were
known
the
sun
seen
through
trees
ch
designates
the
east
ch
has
been
explained
as
a
pig
under
a
roof
the
chinese
idea
common
to
the
irish
peasant
of
home
and
also
as
several
persons
under
a
roof
in
the
same
sense
a
woman
under
a
roof
makes
the
character
ch
peace
words
and
tongue
ch
naturally
suggest
speech
two
hands
ch
in
the
old
form
ch
indicate
friendship
woman
and
birth
ch
born
of
a
woman
means
showing
that
the
ancient
chinese
traced
through
the
mother
and
not
through
the
father
interesting
and
ingenious
as
many
of
these
combinations
are
it
is
clear
that
their
number
too
must
in
any
practical
system
of
writing
be
severely
limited
hence
it
is
not
surprising
that
this
class
of
characters
correctly
called
ideograms
as
representing
ideas
and
not
objects
should
be
a
comparatively
small
one
up
to
this
point
there
seemed
to
be
but
little
chance
of
the
written
language
reaching
a
free
field
for
expansion
it
had
run
so
far
on
lines
sharply
distinct
from
those
of
ordinary
speech
there
was
nothing
in
the
character
which
gave
the
slightest
clue
to
the
sound
of
the
word
it
represented
each
character
therefore
had
to
be
learned
and
recognized
by
a
separate
effort
of
memory
the
first
step
in
a
new
and
as
it
ultimately
proved
the
right
direction
was
the
borrowing
of
a
character
already
in
use
to
represent
another
word
identical
in
sound
though
different
in
meaning
owing
to
the
scarcity
of
vocables
noted
above
there
might
be
as
many
as
ten
different
words
in
common
use
each
pronounced
out
of
those
ten
only
one
we
will
suppose
had
a
character
assigned
to
it
namely
ch
square
originally
said
to
be
a
picture
of
two
boats
joined
together
but
among
the
other
nine
was
meaning
street
or
locality
in
such
common
use
that
it
became
necessary
to
have
some
means
of
writing
it
instead
of
inventing
an
altogether
new
character
as
they
might
have
done
the
chinese
took
ch
square
and
used
it
also
in
the
sense
of
locality
this
was
a
simple
expedient
no
doubt
but
one
that
applied
on
a
large
scale
could
not
but
lead
to
confusion
the
corresponding
difficulty
which
presented
itself
in
speech
was
overcome
as
we
saw
by
many
devices
one
of
which
consisted
in
prefixing
to
the
word
in
question
another
which
served
to
determine
its
special
meaning
a
native
does
not
say
simply
when
he
wishes
to
speak
of
a
place
but
exactly
the
same
device
was
now
adopted
in
writing
the
character
to
square
was
added
another
part
meaning
earth
in
order
to
show
that
the
in
question
had
to
do
with
location
on
the
surface
the
whole
character
thus
appeared
as
ch
once
this
phonetic
principle
had
been
introduced
all
was
smooth
sailing
and
writing
progressed
by
leaps
and
bounds
nothing
was
easier
now
than
to
provide
signs
for
the
other
words
pronounced
a
room
was
ch
to
spin
was
ch
fragrant
was
ch
to
inquire
was
ch
an
embankment
and
hence
to
guard
against
was
ch
to
hinder
was
ch
this
last
example
may
seem
a
little
strange
until
we
remember
that
man
must
have
played
the
principal
part
in
the
development
of
writing
and
that
from
the
masculine
point
of
view
there
is
something
essentially
obstructive
and
unmanageable
in
woman
nature
it
may
be
remarked
by
the
way
that
the
element
woman
is
often
the
determinative
in
characters
that
stand
for
unamiable
qualities
ch
ch
jealous
ch
ch
treacherous
ch
false
and
ch
uncanny
this
class
of
characters
which
constitutes
at
least
of
the
language
has
received
the
convenient
name
of
it
must
be
added
that
the
formation
of
the
phonogram
or
phonetic
compound
did
not
always
proceed
along
such
simple
lines
as
in
the
examples
given
above
where
both
parts
are
pictorial
characters
one
the
phonetic
representing
the
sound
and
the
other
commonly
known
as
the
radical
giving
a
clue
to
the
sense
in
the
first
place
most
of
the
phonetics
now
existing
are
not
simple
pictograms
but
themselves
more
or
less
complex
characters
made
up
in
a
variety
of
ways
on
analysing
for
instance
the
word
ch
to
withdraw
we
find
it
is
composed
of
the
phonetic
ch
combined
with
the
radical
ch
an
abbreviated
form
of
ch
to
walk
but
ch
means
grandson
and
is
itself
a
suggestive
compound
made
up
of
the
two
characters
ch
a
son
and
ch
connect
the
former
character
is
a
simple
pictogram
but
the
latter
is
again
resolvable
into
the
two
elements
ch
a
down
stroke
to
the
left
and
ch
a
strand
of
silk
which
is
here
understood
to
be
the
radical
and
appears
in
its
ancient
form
as
ch
a
picture
of
cocoons
spun
by
the
silkworm
again
the
sound
is
in
most
cases
given
by
no
means
exactly
by
the
phonetic
a
fact
chiefly
due
to
the
pronunciation
having
undergone
changes
which
the
written
character
was
incapable
of
recording
thus
we
have
just
seen
that
the
phonetic
of
ch
is
not
but
there
are
extreme
cases
in
which
a
phonetic
provides
hardly
any
clue
at
all
as
to
the
sound
of
its
derivatives
the
character
ch
for
example
which
by
itself
is
pronounced
appears
in
combination
as
the
modern
phonetic
of
ch
ch
ch
and
ch
though
in
the
last
instance
it
was
not
originally
the
phonetic
but
the
radical
of
a
character
which
was
analysed
as
ch
to
emit
breath
from
ch
the
mouth
the
whole
character
being
a
suggestive
compound
rather
than
an
illustration
of
radical
and
phonetic
combined
in
general
however
it
may
be
said
that
the
final
or
rhyme
is
pretty
accurately
indicated
while
in
not
a
few
cases
the
phonetic
does
give
the
exact
sound
for
all
its
derivatives
thus
the
characters
in
which
the
element
ch
enters
are
pronounced
and
but
ch
and
its
derivatives
are
all
a
considerable
number
of
phonetics
are
nearly
or
entirely
obsolete
as
separate
characters
although
their
family
of
derivatives
may
be
a
very
large
one
ch
for
instance
is
never
seen
by
itself
yet
ch
ch
and
ch
are
among
the
most
important
characters
in
the
language
objections
have
been
raised
in
some
quarters
to
this
account
of
the
phonetic
development
of
chinese
it
is
argued
that
the
primitives
and
whereby
is
meant
any
character
which
is
capable
of
entering
into
combination
with
another
have
really
had
some
influence
on
the
meaning
and
do
not
merely
possess
a
phonetic
value
but
insufficient
evidence
has
hitherto
been
advanced
in
support
of
this
view
the
whole
body
of
chinese
characters
then
may
conveniently
be
divided
up
for
philological
purposes
into
pictograms
ideograms
and
phonograms
the
first
are
pictures
of
objects
the
second
are
composite
symbols
standing
for
abstract
ideas
the
third
are
compound
characters
of
which
the
more
important
element
simply
represents
a
spoken
sound
of
course
in
a
strict
sense
even
the
first
two
classes
do
not
directly
represent
either
objects
or
ideas
but
rather
stand
for
sounds
by
which
these
objects
and
ideas
have
previously
been
expressed
it
may
in
fact
be
said
that
chinese
characters
are
nothing
but
a
number
of
more
or
less
ingenious
devices
for
suggesting
spoken
words
to
a
reader
this
definition
exposes
the
inaccuracy
of
the
popular
notion
that
chinese
is
a
language
of
ideographs
a
mistake
which
even
the
compilers
of
the
english
have
not
avoided
considering
that
all
the
earliest
characters
are
pictorial
and
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
remainder
are
constructed
on
phonetic
principles
it
is
absurd
to
speak
of
chinese
characters
as
symbolizing
the
idea
of
a
thing
without
expressing
the
name
of
it
the
six
scripts
the
chinese
themselves
have
always
been
diligent
students
of
their
written
language
and
at
a
very
early
date
probably
many
centuries
evolved
a
sixfold
classification
of
characters
the
ch
ch
very
inaccurately
translated
by
the
six
scripts
which
may
be
briefly
noticed
ch
ch
indicative
or
characters
this
is
a
very
small
class
including
only
the
simplest
numerals
and
a
few
others
such
as
ch
above
and
ch
below
ch
ch
pictographic
characters
ch
ch
or
ch
ch
phonetic
compounds
ch
ch
suggestive
compounds
based
on
a
natural
association
of
ideas
to
this
class
alone
can
the
term
ideographs
be
properly
applied
ch
ch
the
meaning
of
the
name
has
been
much
disputed
some
saying
that
it
means
turned
round
ch
eye
is
now
written
ch
others
understand
it
as
comprising
a
few
groups
of
characters
nearly
related
in
sense
each
character
consisting
of
an
element
common
to
the
group
together
with
a
specific
and
detachable
part
ch
ch
and
ch
all
of
which
have
the
meaning
old
this
class
may
be
ignored
altogether
seeing
that
it
is
concerned
not
with
the
origin
of
characters
but
only
with
peculiarities
in
their
use
ch
ch
borrowed
characters
as
explained
above
that
is
characters
adopted
for
different
words
simply
because
of
the
identity
of
sound
the
order
of
this
native
classification
is
not
to
be
taken
as
in
any
sense
chronological
roughly
it
may
be
said
that
the
development
of
writing
followed
the
course
previously
traced
that
is
beginning
with
indicative
signs
and
going
on
with
pictograms
and
ideograms
until
finally
the
discovery
of
the
phonetic
principle
did
away
with
all
necessity
for
other
devices
in
enlarging
the
written
language
but
we
have
no
direct
evidence
that
this
was
so
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
phonetic
compounds
made
their
appearance
at
a
very
early
date
probably
prior
to
the
invention
of
a
large
number
of
suggestive
compounds
and
perhaps
even
before
the
whole
existing
stock
of
pictograms
had
been
fashioned
it
is
significant
that
numerous
words
of
daily
occurrence
which
must
have
had
a
place
in
the
earliest
stages
of
human
thought
are
expressed
by
phonetic
characters
we
can
be
fairly
certain
at
any
rate
that
the
period
of
borrowed
characters
did
not
last
very
long
though
it
is
thought
that
traces
of
it
are
to
be
seen
in
the
habit
of
writing
several
characters
especially
those
for
certain
plants
and
animals
indifferently
with
or
without
their
radicals
thus
ch
ch
a
tadpole
is
frequently
written
ch
ch

part

or
reptile

found
on
bronzes
dating
from
the
period
extending
from
the
beginning
of
the
shang
dynasty
in
the
century

earlier

a
point

be

ancient
bronzes

mainly
take
the
shape

bells

and

utensils
were
until
within
the
last
decade
our
sole
source
of
information
concerning
the
origin
and
early
history
of
chinese
writing
but
recently
a
large
number
of
inscribed
bone
fragments
have
been
excavated
in
the
north
of
china
providing
new
and
unexpected
matter
for
investigation
the
inscriptions
on
these
bones
have
already
furnished
a
list
of
nearly
separate
characters
of
which
not
more
than
about
have
been
so
far
identified
they
appear
to
be
responses
given
by
professional
soothsayers
to
private
individuals
who
came
to
them
seeking
the
aid
of
divination
in
the
affairs
of
their
daily
life
it
is
difficult
to
fix
their
date
with
much
exactitude
the
script
though
less
archaic
than
that
of
the
earlier
bronzes
is
nevertheless
of
an
exceedingly
free
and
irregular
type
judging
by
the
style
of
the
inscriptions
alone
one
would
be
inclined
to
assign
them
to
the
early
years
of
the
chou
dynasty
say
but
mr
hopkins
thinks
that
they
represent
a
mode
of
writing
already
obsolete
at
the
time
of
their
production
and
retained
of
set
purpose
by
the
diviners
from
obscurantist
motives
much
as
the
ancient
hieroglyphics
were
employed
by
the
egyptian
priesthood
he
would
therefore
date
them
about
years
later
or
only
half
a
century
before
the
birth
of
confucius
if
that
is
so
they
are
merely
late
specimens
of
the
ancient
figures
appearing
long
after
the
latter
had
made
way
for
a
new
and
more
conventionalized
form
of
writing
this
new
writing
is
called
in
chinese
ch
which
is
commonly
rendered
by
the
word
seal
for
the
somewhat
unscientific
reason
that
many
ages
afterwards
it
was
generally
adopted
for
use
on
seals
under
the
chou
dynasty
however
as
well
as
the
two
succeeding
it
the
meaning
of
the
word
was
not
seal
but
sinuous
curves
as
made
in
writing
it
has
accordingly
been
suggested
that
this
epoch
marks
the
first
introduction
into
china
of
the
brush
in
place
of
the
bamboo
or
wooden
pencil
with
frayed
end
which
was
used
with
some
kind
of
colouring
matter
or
varnish
there
are
many
arguments
both
for
and
against
this
view
but
it
is
unquestionable
at
any
rate
that
the
introduction
of
a
supple
implement
like
the
brush
at
the
very
time
when
the
forms
of
characters
were
fast
becoming
crystallized
and
fixed
would
be
sufficient
to
account
for
a
great
revolution
in
the
style
of
writing
authentic
specimens
of
the
ch
ch
older
or
greater
seal
writing
are
exceedingly
rare
but
it
is
generally
believed
that
the
inscriptions
on
the
famous
stone
drums
now
at
peking
date
from
the
reign
of
king
hsüan
and
they
may
therefore
with
practical
certainty
be
cited
as
examples
of
the
greater
seal
in
its
original
form
these
drums
are
really
ten
roughly
chiselled
mountain
boulders
which
were
discovered
in
the
early
part
of
the
century
lying
half
buried
in
the
ground
near
fu
in
the
province
of
shensi
on
them
are
engraved
ten
odes
a
complete
ode
being
cut
on
each
drum
celebrating
an
imperial
hunting
and
fishing
expedition
in
that
part
of
the
country
a
facsimile
of
one
of
these
taken
from
an
old
rubbing
and
reproduced
in
dr
of
chinese
shows
that
great
strides
had
been
made
in
this
writing
towards
symmetry
compactness
and
conventionalism
the
vogue
of
the
greater
seal
appears
to
have
lasted
until
the
reign
of
the
first
emperor
see
when
a
further
modification
took
place
for
many
centuries
china
had
been
split
up
into
a
number
of
practically
independent
states
and
this
circumstance
seems
to
have
led
to
considerable
variations
in
the
styles
of
writing
having
succeeded
in
unifying
the
empire
the
first
emperor
proceeded
on
the
advice
of
his
minister
li
ss
u
to
standardize
its
script
by
ordaining
that
only
the
style
in
use
in
his
own
state
of
should
henceforward
be
employed
throughout
china
it
is
clear
then
that
this
new
style
of
writing
was
nothing
more
than
the
greater
seal
characters
in
the
form
they
had
assumed
after
several
centuries
of
evolution
with
numerous
abbreviations
and
modifications
it
was
afterwards
known
as
the
ch
ch
or
lesser
seal
and
is
familiar
to
us
from
the
dictionary
see
though
a
decided
improvement
on
what
had
gone
before
the
lesser
seal
was
destined
to
have
but
a
short
career
of
undisputed
supremacy
reform
was
in
the
air
and
something
less
cumbrous
was
soon
felt
to
be
necessary
by
the
clerks
who
had
to
supply
the
immense
quantity
of
written
reports
demanded
by
the
first
emperor
thus
it
came
about
that
a
yet
simpler
and
certainly
more
artistic
form
of
writing
was
already
in
use
though
not
universally
so
not
long
after
the
decree
abolishing
the
greater
seal
this
ch
ch
or
official
script
as
it
is
called
shows
a
great
advance
on
the
seal
character
so
much
so
that
one
can
not
help
suspecting
the
traditional
account
of
its
invention
it
is
perhaps
more
likely
to
have
been
directly
evolved
from
the
greater
seal
if
the
lesser
seal
was
the
script
of
the
state
of
we
should
certainly
expect
to
find
a
more
highly
developed
system
of
writing
in
some
of
the
other
states
unlike
the
seal
the
is
perfectly
legible
to
one
acquainted
only
with
the
modern
character
from
which
indeed
it
differs
but
in
minor
details
how
long
the
lesser
seal
continued
to
exist
side
by
side
with
the
is
a
question
which
can
not
be
answered
with
certainty
it
was
evidently
quite
obsolete
however
at
the
time
of
the
compilation
of
the
about
a
hundred
years
after
the
christian
era
as
for
the
greater
seal
and
still
earlier
forms
of
writing
they
were
not
merely
obsolete
but
had
fallen
into
utter
oblivion
before
the
han
dynasty
was
fifty
years
old
when
a
number
of
classical
texts
were
discovered
bricked
up
in
old
houses
about
the
style
of
writing
was
considered
so
singular
by
the
literati
of
the
period
that
they
refused
to
believe
it
was
the
ordinary
ancient
character
at
all
and
nicknamed
it
tadpole
character
from
some
fancied
resemblance
in
shape
the
theory
that
these
tadpole
characters
were
not
chinese
but
a
species
of
cuneiform
script
in
which
the
wedges
might
possibly
suggest
tadpoles
must
be
dismissed
as
too
wildly
improbable
for
serious
consideration
but
we
may
advert
for
a
moment
to
a
famous
inscription
in
which
the
real
tadpole
characters
of
antiquity
are
said
to
appear
this
is
on
a
stone
tablet
alleged
to
have
been
erected
on
mount
hêng
in
the
modern
hupeh
by
the
legendary
emperor
yü
as
a
record
of
his
labours
in
draining
away
the
great
flood
which
submerged
part
of
china
in
the
century
after
more
than
one
fruitless
search
the
actual
monument
is
said
to
have
been
discovered
on
a
peak
of
the
mountain
in
and
a
transcription
was
made
which
may
be
seen
reproduced
as
a
curiosity
in
legge
vol
iii
for
several
reasons
however
the
whole
affair
must
be
regarded
as
a
gross
imposture
out
of
the
official
script
two
other
forms
were
soon
developed
namely
the
ch
ch
or
grass
character
which
so
curtails
the
usual
strokes
as
to
be
comparable
to
a
species
of
shorthand
requiring
special
study
and
the
ch
ch
or
running
hand
used
in
ordinary
correspondence
some
form
of
grass
character
is
mentioned
as
in
use
as
early
as
or
thereabouts
though
how
nearly
it
approximated
to
the
modern
grass
hand
it
is
hard
to
say
the
running
hand
seems
to
have
come
several
centuries
later
the
final
standardization
of
chinese
writing
was
due
to
the
great
calligraphist
wang
of
the
century
who
gave
currency
to
the
graceful
style
of
character
known
as
ch
ch
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
clerkly
hand
when
was
invented
some
centuries
later
the
characters
were
cut
on
this
model
which
still
survives
at
the
present
day
it
is
no
doubt
owing
to
the
early
introduction
of
printing
that
the
script
of
china
has
remained
practically
unchanged
ever
since
the
manuscript
rolls
of
the
and
preceding
dynasties
recently
discovered
by
dr
stein
in
turkestan
furnish
direct
evidence
of
this
fact
showing
as
they
do
a
style
of
writing
not
only
clear
and
legible
but
remarkably
modern
in
appearance
the
whole
history
of
chinese
writing
then
is
characterized
by
a
slow
progressive
development
which
precludes
the
idea
of
divisions
between
one
period
and
another
the
chinese
themselves
however
have
canonized
quite
a
series
of
alleged
inventors
starting
from
fu
hsi
a
mythical
emperor
of
the
third
millennium
who
is
said
to
have
developed
a
complete
system
of
written
characters
from
the
markings
on
the
back
of
a
hence
by
the
way
the
origin
of
the
dragon
as
an
imperial
emblem
as
a
rule
the
credit
of
the
invention
of
the
art
of
writing
is
given
to
chieh
a
being
with
fabulous
attributes
who
conceived
the
idea
of
a
written
language
from
the
markings
of
birds
claws
upon
the
sand
the
diffusion
of
the
greater
seal
script
is
traced
to
a
work
in
fifteen
chapters
published
by
shih
chou
historiographer
in
the
reign
of
king
hsüan
the
lesser
seal
again
is
often
ascribed
to
li
ss
u
himself
whereas
the
utmost
he
can
have
done
in
the
matter
was
to
urge
its
introduction
into
common
use
likewise
mo
of
the
century
is
supposed
to
have
invented
the
while
in
prison
and
one
account
attributes
the
lesser
seal
to
him
as
well
but
the
fact
is
that
the
whole
history
of
writing
as
it
stands
in
chinese
authors
is
in
hopeless
confusion
when
about
to
embark
on
the
study
of
a
foreign
language
the
student
first
thought
is
to
provide
himself
with
two
indispensable
aids
a
dictionary
and
a
grammar
the
chinese
have
found
no
difficulty
in
producing
the
former
see
now
what
as
to
the
grammar
he
might
reasonably
expect
a
people
so
industrious
in
the
cultivation
of
their
language
to
have
evolved
some
system
of
grammar
which
to
a
certain
degree
would
help
to
smooth
his
path
and
yet
the
contrary
is
the
case
no
set
of
rules
governing
the
mutual
relations
of
words
has
ever
been
formulated
by
the
chinese
apparently
because
the
need
of
such
rules
has
never
been
felt
the
most
that
native
writers
have
done
is
to
draw
a
distinction
between
ch
ch
and
ch
ch
full
and
empty
words
respectively
the
former
being
subdivided
into
ch
ch
living
words
or
verbs
and
ch
ch
dead
words
or
by
empty
words
particles
are
meant
though
sometimes
the
expression
is
loosely
applied
to
abstract
terms
including
verbs
the
above
meagre
classification
is
their
nearest
approach
to
a
conception
of
grammar
in
our
sense
this
in
itself
does
not
prove
that
a
chinese
grammar
is
impossible
nor
that
if
constructed
it
might
not
be
helpful
to
the
student
as
a
matter
of
fact
several
attempts
have
been
made
by
foreigners
to
deduce
a
grammatical
system
which
should
prove
as
rigid
and
binding
as
those
of
western
languages
though
it
can
not
be
said
that
any
as
yet
has
stood
the
test
of
time
or
criticism
other
writers
have
gone
to
the
other
extreme
and
maintained
that
chinese
has
no
grammar
at
all
in
this
dictum
exaggerated
as
it
sounds
there
is
a
very
substantial
amount
of
truth
every
chinese
character
is
an
indivisible
unit
representing
a
sound
and
standing
for
a
being
free
from
inflection
or
agglutination
of
any
kind
it
is
incapable
of
indicating
in
itself
either
gender
number
or
case
voice
mood
tense
or
person
of
european
languages
english
stands
nearest
to
chinese
in
this
respect
whence
it
follows
that
the
construction
of
a
hybrid
jargon
like
pidgin
english
presents
fewer
difficulties
than
would
be
the
case
for
instance
with
pidgin
german
for
pidgin
english
simply
consists
in
taking
english
words
and
treating
them
like
chinese
characters
that
is
divesting
them
of
all
troublesome
inflections
and
reducing
them
to
a
set
of
arranged
in
logical
sequence
you
wantchee
my
no
wantchee
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
literally
rendered
chinese
ch
ch
ch
ch
ch
do
you
want
me
or
not
but
we
may
go
further
and
say
that
no
chinese
character
can
be
definitely
regarded
as
being
any
particular
part
of
speech
or
possessing
any
particular
function
absolutely
apart
from
the
general
tenor
of
its
context
thus
taken
singly
the
character
ch
conveys
only
the
general
idea
above
as
opposed
to
below
according
to
its
place
in
the
sentence
and
the
requirements
of
common
sense
it
may
be
a
noun
meaning
upper
person
that
is
a
ruler
an
adjective
meaning
upper
topmost
or
best
an
adverb
meaning
above
a
preposition
meaning
upon
and
finally
a
verb
meaning
to
mount
upon
or
to
go
to
ch
is
a
character
that
may
usually
be
translated
to
enter
as
in
ch
ch
to
enter
a
door
yet
in
the
locution
ch
ch
enter
wood
the
verb
becomes
causative
and
the
meaning
is
to
put
into
a
coffin
it
would
puzzle
grammarians
to
determine
the
precise
grammatical
function
of
any
of
the
words
in
the
following
sentence
with
the
exception
of
ch
an
interrogative
by
the
way
which
here
happens
to
mean
why
but
in
other
contexts
is
equivalent
to
how
which
or
what
ch
ch
ch
ch
affair
why
must
ancient
or
in
more
idiomatic
english
why
necessarily
stick
to
the
ways
of
the
ancients
in
such
matters
or
take
a
proverbial
saying
like
ch
ch
ch
ch
ch
ch
which
may
be
correctly
rendered
the
less
a
man
has
seen
the
more
he
has
to
wonder
at
it
is
one
thing
however
to
translate
it
correctly
and
another
to
explain
how
this
translation
can
be
inferred
from
the
individual
words
of
which
the
bald
equivalents
might
be
given
as
few
what
see
many
what
strange
to
say
that
strange
is
the
literal
equivalent
of
ch
does
not
mean
that
ch
can
be
definitely
classed
as
an
adjective
on
the
other
hand
it
would
be
dangerous
even
to
assert
that
the
word
here
plays
the
part
of
an
active
verb
because
it
would
be
equally
permissible
to
translate
the
above
many
things
are
strange
to
one
who
has
seen
but
little
chinese
grammar
then
so
far
as
it
deals
with
the
classification
of
separate
words
may
well
be
given
up
as
a
bad
job
but
there
still
remains
the
art
of
syntax
the
due
arrangement
of
words
to
form
sentences
according
to
certain
established
rules
here
at
any
rate
we
are
on
somewhat
firmer
ground
and
for
many
years
the
dictum
that
the
whole
of
chinese
grammar
depends
upon
position
was
regarded
as
a
golden
key
to
the
written
language
of
china
it
is
perfectly
true
that
there
are
certain
positions
and
collocations
of
words
which
tend
to
recur
but
when
one
sits
down
to
formulate
a
set
of
rules
governing
these
positions
it
is
soon
found
to
be
a
thankless
task
for
the
number
of
qualifications
and
exceptions
which
will
have
to
be
added
is
so
great
as
to
render
the
rule
itself
valueless
ch
ch
means
on
a
horse
ch
ch
to
get
on
a
horse
but
it
will
not
do
to
say
that
a
preposition
becomes
a
verb
when
placed
before
the
substantive
as
many
other
prepositions
come
before
and
not
after
the
words
they
govern
if
we
meet
such
a
phrase
as
ch
ch
literally
warn
rebels
we
must
not
mentally
label
ch
as
a
verb
and
ch
as
a
substantive
and
say
to
ourselves
that
in
chinese
the
verb
is
followed
immediately
by
its
object
otherwise
we
might
be
tempted
to
translate
to
warn
the
rebels
whereas
a
little
reflection
would
show
us
that
the
conjunction
of
warning
and
rebels
naturally
leads
to
the
meaning
to
warn
the
populace
or
whoever
it
may
be
the
rebels
after
all
our
adventurous
incursions
into
the
domain
of
syntax
we
are
soon
brought
back
to
the
and
are
obliged
to
confess
that
each
particular
passage
is
best
interpreted
on
its
own
merits
by
the
logic
of
the
context
and
the
application
of
common
sense
there
is
no
reason
why
chinese
sentences
should
not
be
dissected
by
those
who
take
pleasure
in
such
operations
into
subject
copula
and
predicate
but
it
should
be
early
impressed
upon
the
beginner
that
the
profit
likely
to
accrue
to
him
therefrom
is
infinitesimal
as
for
fixed
rules
of
grammatical
construction
so
far
from
being
a
help
he
will
find
them
a
positive
hindrance
it
should
rather
be
his
aim
to
free
his
mind
from
such
trammels
and
to
accustom
himself
to
look
upon
each
character
as
a
not
a
definite
part
of
speech
book
turning
now
to
some
of
the
more
salient
characteristics
of
the
book
language
with
the
object
of
explaining
how
it
came
to
be
so
widely
separated
from
common
speech
we
might
reasonably
suppose
that
in
primitive
times
the
two
stood
in
much
closer
relation
to
each
other
than
now
but
it
is
certainly
a
striking
fact
that
the
earliest
literary
remains
of
any
magnitude
that
have
come
down
to
us
should
exhibit
a
style
very
far
removed
from
any
possible
colloquial
idiom
the
speeches
of
the
book
of
history
see
are
more
manifestly
fictitious
by
many
degrees
than
the
elaborate
orations
in
thucydides
and
livy
if
we
can
not
believe
that
socrates
actually
spoke
the
words
attributed
to
him
in
the
dialogues
of
plato
much
less
can
we
expect
to
find
the
of
confucius
in
any
of
his
recorded
sayings
in
the
beginning
all
characters
doubtless
represented
spoken
words
but
it
must
very
soon
have
dawned
on
the
practical
chinese
mind
that
there
was
no
need
to
reproduce
in
writing
the
bisyllabic
compounds
of
common
speech
to
see
in
its
written
form
ch
could
not
possibly
be
confused
with
any
other
and
it
was
therefore
unnecessary
to
go
to
the
trouble
of
writing
ch
ch
as
in
colloquial
there
was
a
wonderful
outburst
of
literary
activity
in
the
confucian
era
when
it
would
seem
that
the
older
and
more
cumbrous
form
of
seal
character
was
still
in
vogue
if
the
mere
manual
labour
of
writing
was
so
great
we
can
not
wonder
that
all
superfluous
particles
or
other
words
that
could
be
dispensed
with
were
ruthlessly
cut
away
so
it
came
about
that
all
the
old
classical
works
were
composed
in
the
tersest
of
language
as
remote
as
can
be
imagined
from
the
speech
of
the
people
the
passion
for
brevity
and
conciseness
was
pushed
to
an
extreme
and
resulted
more
often
than
not
in
such
obscurity
that
detailed
commentaries
on
the
classics
were
found
to
be
necessary
and
have
always
constituted
an
important
branch
of
chinese
literature
after
the
introduction
of
the
improved
style
of
script
and
when
the
mechanical
means
of
writing
had
been
simplified
it
may
be
supposed
that
literary
diction
also
became
freer
and
more
expansive
this
did
happen
to
some
extent
but
the
classics
were
held
in
such
veneration
as
to
exercise
the
profoundest
influence
over
all
succeeding
schools
of
writers
and
the
divorce
between
literature
and
pooular
speech
became
permanent
and
irreconcilable
the
book
language
absorbed
all
the
interest
and
energy
of
scholars
and
it
was
inevitable
that
this
elevation
of
the
written
should
be
accompanied
by
a
corresponding
degradation
of
the
spoken
word
this
must
largely
account
for
the
somewhat
remarkable
fact
that
the
art
of
oratory
and
public
speaking
has
never
been
deemed
worthy
of
cultivation
in
china
while
the
comparatively
low
position
occupied
by
the
drama
may
also
be
referred
to
the
same
cause
at
the
same
time
the
term
book
language
in
its
widest
sense
covers
a
multitude
of
styles
some
of
which
differ
from
each
other
nearly
as
much
as
from
ordinary
speech
the
department
of
fiction
see
which
the
lettered
chinaman
affects
to
despise
and
will
not
readily
admit
within
the
charmed
circle
of
literature
really
constitutes
a
bridge
spanning
the
gulf
between
the
severer
classical
style
and
the
colloquial
while
an
elegant
terseness
characterises
the
novel
there
are
others
in
which
the
style
is
loose
and
shambling
still
it
remains
true
that
no
book
of
any
literary
pretensions
would
be
easily
intelligible
to
any
class
of
chinamen
educated
or
otherwise
if
read
aloud
exactly
as
printed
the
public
reader
of
stories
is
obliged
to
translate
so
to
speak
into
the
colloquial
of
his
audience
as
he
goes
along
there
is
no
inherent
reason
why
the
conversation
of
everyday
life
should
not
be
rendered
into
characters
as
is
done
in
foreign
handbooks
for
teaching
elementary
chinese
one
can
only
say
that
the
chinese
do
not
think
it
worth
while
there
are
a
few
words
indeed
which
though
common
enough
in
the
mouths
of
genteel
and
vulgar
alike
have
positively
no
characters
to
represent
them
on
the
other
hand
there
is
a
vast
store
of
purely
book
words
which
would
never
be
used
or
understood
in
conversation
the
book
language
is
not
only
nice
in
its
choice
of
words
it
also
has
to
obey
special
rules
of
construction
of
these
perhaps
the
most
apparent
is
the
carefully
marked
antithesis
between
characters
in
different
clauses
of
a
sentence
which
results
in
a
kind
of
parallelism
or
rhythmic
balance
this
parallelism
is
a
noticeable
feature
in
ordinary
poetical
composition
and
may
be
well
illustrated
by
the
following
stanza
ch
ch
ch
ch
ch
the
bright
sun
completes
its
course
behind
the
mountains
ch
ch
ch
ch
ch
the
yellow
river
flows
away
into
the
sea
ch
ch
ch
ch
ch
would
you
command
a
prospect
of
a
thousand
ch
ch
ch
ch
ch
climb
yet
one
storey
higher
in
the
first
line
of
this
piece
every
single
character
is
balanced
by
a
corresponding
one
in
the
second
ch
white
by
ch
yellow
ch
sun
by
ch
river
and
so
on
in
the
and
lines
where
more
laxity
is
generally
allowed
every
word
again
has
its
counterpart
with
the
sole
exception
of
ch
wish
and
ch
further
the
question
is
often
asked
what
sort
of
instrument
is
chinese
for
the
expression
of
thought
as
a
medium
for
the
conveyance
of
historical
facts
subtle
emotions
or
abstruse
philosophical
conceptions
can
it
compare
with
the
languages
of
the
western
world
the
answers
given
to
this
question
have
varied
considerably
but
it
is
noteworthy
that
those
who
most
depreciate
the
qualities
of
chinese
are
generally
speaking
theorists
rather
than
persons
possessing
a
profound
knowledge
of
the
language
itself
such
writers
argue
that
want
of
inflection
in
the
characters
must
tend
to
make
chinese
hard
and
inelastic
and
therefore
incapable
of
bringing
out
the
finer
shades
of
thought
and
emotion
answering
one
a
priori
argument
with
another
one
might
fairly
retort
that
if
anything
flexibility
is
the
precise
quality
to
be
predicated
of
a
language
in
which
any
character
may
according
to
the
requirements
of
the
context
be
interpreted
either
as
noun
verb
or
adjective
but
all
such
reasoning
is
somewhat
futile
it
will
scarcely
be
contended
that
german
being
highly
inflected
is
therefore
superior
in
range
and
power
to
english
from
which
inflections
have
largely
disappeared
some
of
the
early
jesuit
missionaries
men
of
great
natural
ability
who
steeped
themselves
in
oriental
learning
have
left
very
different
opinions
on
record
chinese
appeared
to
them
as
admirable
for
the
superabundant
richness
of
its
vocabulary
as
for
the
conciseness
of
its
literary
style
and
among
modern
scholars
there
is
a
decided
tendency
to
accept
this
view
as
embodying
a
great
deal
more
truth
than
the
other
another
question
much
debated
years
ago
which
time
itself
is
now
satisfactorily
answering
was
whether
the
chinese
language
would
be
able
to
assimilate
the
vast
stock
of
new
terminology
which
closer
contact
with
the
west
would
necessarily
carry
with
it
two
possible
courses
it
seemed
were
open
either
fresh
characters
would
be
formed
on
the
principle
or
the
new
idea
might
be
expressed
by
the
conjunction
of
two
or
more
characters
already
existing
the
former
expedient
had
been
tried
on
a
limited
scale
in
japan
where
in
the
course
of
time
new
characters
were
formed
on
the
same
principle
as
of
old
which
were
yet
purely
japanese
and
find
no
place
in
a
chinese
dictionary
but
although
the
field
for
such
additions
was
boundless
the
chinese
have
all
along
been
chary
of
extending
the
language
in
this
way
probably
because
these
modern
terms
had
no
chinese
sound
which
might
have
suggested
some
particular
phonetic
they
have
preferred
to
adopt
the
other
method
of
which
ch
ch
ch
for
lift
and
ch
ch
ch
ch
for
parliament
are
examples
even
a
metaphysical
abstraction
like
the
absolute
has
been
tentatively
expressed
by
ch
ch
but
in
this
case
an
equivalent
was
already
existing
in
the
chinese
language
a
very
drastic
measure
strongly
advocated
in
some
quarters
is
the
entire
abolition
of
all
characters
to
be
replaced
by
their
equivalent
sounds
in
letters
of
the
alphabet
under
this
scheme
ch
would
figure
as
or
ch
as
and
so
on
but
the
proposal
has
fallen
extremely
flat
the
vocables
as
we
have
seen
are
so
few
in
number
that
only
the
colloquial
if
even
that
could
possibly
be
transcribed
in
this
manner
any
attempt
to
transliterate
classical
chinese
would
result
in
a
mere
jumble
of
sounds
utterly
unintelligible
even
with
the
addition
of
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
case
the
characters
are
a
potent
bond
of
union
between
the
different
parts
of
the
empire
with
their
various
dialects
if
they
should
ever
fall
into
disuse
china
will
have
taken
a
first
and
most
fatal
step
towards
internal
disruption
even
the
japanese
whose
language
is
not
only
free
from
dialects
but
polysyllabic
and
therefore
more
suitable
for
romanization
have
utterly
refused
to
abandon
the
chinese
script
which
in
spite
of
certain
disadvantages
has
hitherto
triumphantly
adapted
itself

the
needs

chinese
literature
the
literature
of
china
is
remarkable
for
its
antiquity
coupled
with
an
unbroken
continuity
down
to
the
present
day
for
the
variety
of
subjects
presented
and
for
the
exhaustive
treatment
which
not
only
each
subject
but
also
each
subdivision
each
separate
item
has
received
as
well
as
for
the
colossal
scale
on
which
so
many
literary
monuments
have
been
conceived
and
carried
out
for
the
accuracy
of
its
historical
statements
so
far
as
it
has
been
possible
to
test
them
and
further
for
its
ennobling
standards
and
lofty
ideals
as
well
as
for
its
wholesome
purity
and
an
almost
total
absence
of
coarseness
and
obscenity
no
history
of
chinese
literature
in
the
chinese
language
has
yet
been
produced
native
scholars
however
have
adopted
for
bibliographical
purposes
a
rough
division
into
four
great
classes
under
the
first
of
these
we
find
the
confucian
canon
together
with
lexicographical
philological
and
other
works
dealing
with
the
elucidation
of
words
under
the
second
histories
of
various
kinds
officially
compiled
privately
written
constitutional
also
biography
geography
and
bibliography
under
the
third
philosophy
religion
buddhism
the
arts
and
sciences
war
law
agriculture
medicine
astronomy
painting
music
and
archery
also
a
host
of
general
works
monographs
and
treatises
on
a
number
of
topics
as
well
as
encyclopaedias
the
fourth
class
is
confined
to
poetry
of
all
descriptions
poetical
critiques
and
works
dealing
with
the
rhymes
proceeding
chronologically
without
reference
to
chinese
classification
we
have
to
begin
as
would
naturally
be
expected
with
the
last
of
the
above
four
classes
man
first
literary
utterances
in
china
as
elsewhere
took
the
form
of
verse
and
the
earliest
chinese
records
in
our
possession
are
the
national
lyrics
the
songs
and
ballads
chiefly
of
the
feudal
age
which
reaches
back
to
over
a
thousand
years
before
christ
some
pieces
are
indeed
attributed
to
the
century
the
latest
bring
us
down
to
the
century
such
is
the
collection
entitled
or
popularly
known
as
the
odes
which
was
brought
together
and
edited
by
confucius
and
is
now
included
among
the
sacred
books
forming
as
it
does
an
important
portion
of
the
confucian
canon
these
odes
once
over
three
thousand
in
number
were
reduced
by
confucius
to
three
hundred
and
eleven
hence
they
are
frequently
spoken
of
as
the
three
hundred
they
treat
of
war
and
love
of
eating
and
drinking
and
dancing
of
the
virtues
and
vices
of
rulers
and
of
the
misery
and
happiness
of
the
people
they
are
in
rhyme
rhyme
is
essential
to
chinese
poetry
there
is
no
such
thing
as
blank
verse
further
the
rhymes
of
the
odes
have
always
been
and
are
still
the
only
recognized
rhymes
which
can
be
used
by
a
chinese
poet
anything
else
being
regarded
as
mere
jingle
poetical
licence
however
is
tolerated
and
great
masters
have
availed
themselves
freely
of
its
aid
one
curious
result
of
this
is
that
whereas
in
many
instances
two
given
words
may
have
rhymed
as
no
doubt
they
did
in
the
speech
of
three
thousand
years
ago
they
no
longer
rhyme
to
the
ear
in
the
colloquial
of
although
still
accepted
as
true
and
proper
rhymes
in
the
composition
of
verse
it
is
noticeable
at
once
that
the
odes
are
mostly
written
in
lines
of
four
words
examples
of
lines
consisting
of
any
length
from
a
single
word
to
eight
though
such
do
exist
being
comparatively
rare
these
lines
of
four
words
generally
recognized
as
the
oldest
measure
in
chinese
poetry
are
frequently
grouped
as
quatrains
in
which
the
first
second
and
fourth
lines
rhyme
but
very
often
only
the
second
and
fourth
lines
rhyme
and
sometimes
there
are
groups
of
a
larger
number
of
lines
in
which
occasional
lines
are
found
without
any
rhyme
at
all
a
few
stray
pieces
as
old
as
many
of
those
found
among
the
odes
have
been
handed
down
and
preserved
in
which
the
metre
consists
of
two
lines
of
three
words
followed
by
one
line
of
seven
words
these
three
lines
all
rhyme
but
the
rhyme
changes
with
each
succeeding
triplet
it
would
be
difficult
to
persuade
the
english
reader
that
this
is
a
very
effective
measure
and
one
in
which
many
a
gloomy
or
pathetic
tale
has
been
told
in
order
to
realise
how
a
few
chinese
monosyllables
in
juxtaposition
can
stir
the
human
heart
to
its
lowest
depths
it
is
necessary
to
devote
some
years
to
the
study
of
the
language
at
the
close
of
the
century
a
dithyrambic
measure
irregular
and
wild
was
introduced
and
enjoyed
considerable
vogue
it
has
indeed
been
freely
adopted
by
numerous
poets
from
that
early
date
down
to
the
present
day
but
since
the
century
it
has
been
displaced
from
by
the
and
measures
which
are
now
after
much
refinement
the
accepted
standards
for
chinese
poetry
the
origin
of
the
metre
is
lost
in
remote
antiquity
the
metre
was
elaborated
under
the
of
mei
shêng
who
died
passing
over
seven
centuries
of
growth
we
reach
the
dynasty
the
most
brilliant
epoch
in
the
history
of
chinese
poetry
these
three
hundred
years
produced
an
extraordinarily
large
number
of
great
poets
and
an
output
of
verse
of
almost
incredible
extent
in
an
anthology
of
the
poets
was
published
by
imperial
order
it
ran
to
nine
hundred
books
or
sections
and
contained
over
thousand
nine
hundred
separate
poems
a
copy
of
this
work
is
in
the
chinese
department
of
the
university
library
at
cambridge
it
was
under
the
dynasty
that
a
certain
finality
was
reached
in
regard
to
the
strict
application
of
the
tones
to
chinese
verse
for
the
purposes
of
poetry
all
words
in
the
language
were
ranged
under
one
or
the
other
of
two
tones
the
and
the
the
former
now
including
the
two
even
tones
of
which
prior
to
the
century
there
was
only
one
and
the
latter
including
the
rising
sinking
and
entering
tones
of
ordinary
speech
the
incidence
of
these
tones
which
may
be
roughly
described
as
sharps
and
flats
finally
became
fixed
just
as
the
incidence
of
certain
feet
in
latin
metres
came
to
be
governed
by
fixed
rules
thus

the
above
are
only
two
metres
out
of
many
but
enough
perhaps
to
give
to
any
one
who
will
read
them
with
a
pause
or
as
marked
by
o
in
each
specimen
a
fair
idea
of
the
rhythmic
lilt
of
chinese
poetry
to
the
trained
ear
the
effect
is
most
pleasing
and
when
this
scansion
so
to
speak
is
united
with
rhyme
and
choice
diction
the
result
is
a
vehicle
for
verse
artificial
no
doubt
and
elaborate
but
admirably
adapted
to
the
genius
of
the
chinese
language
moreover
in
the
hands
of
the
great
poets
this
artificiality
disappears
altogether
each
word
seems
to
slip
naturally
into
its
place
and
so
far
from
having
been
introduced
by
violence
for
the
ends
of
prosody
it
appears
to
be
the
very
best
word
that
could
have
been
chosen
even
had
there
been
no
trammels
of
any
kind
so
effectually
is
the
art
of
the
poet
concealed
by
art
from
the
long
string
of
names
which
have
shed
lustre
upon
this
glorious
age
of
chinese
poetry
it
may
suffice
for
the
present
purpose
to
mention
the
following
all
of
the
very
first
rank

to
succeed

the
public
competitive

led
the
life
of
a
recluse

on

obtained
an
official
post

he
was
of
a
timid
disposition
and
once
when
the
emperor

by
his
fame
came
to
visit
him
he
hid
himself
under

bed
his

addition

being

a
of
great
distinction
he

a
firm

in
buddhism
and
after
losing
his
wife
and
mother
he
turned
his
mountain
home
into
a

to

death

a
tipsy
frolic

ranked
with

the
two
being
jointly
spoken
of
as
the
chief
poets
of
their
age
the
former
had
indeed
such
a
high
opinion
of
his
own
poetry
that
he
prescribed
it
for
malarial
fever
he
led
a
chequered
and
wandering
life
and
died
from
the
effects
of
eating
roast
beef
and
drinking
white
wine
to
excess
immediately
after
a
long
fast
po

a
very
prolific
poet
he
held
several
high
official
posts
but
found
time
for
a
considerable
output
of
some
of
the
finest
poetry
in
the
language
his
poems
were
collected
by
imperial
command
and
engraved
upon
tablets
of
stone
in
one
of
them
he
anticipates
by
eight
centuries
the
famous
ode
by
malherbe
du
perrier
sur
la
mort
de
sa
the
dynasty
with
all
its
glories
had
not
long
passed
away
before
another
imperial
house
arose
under
which
poetry
flourished
again
in
full
vigour
the
poets
of
the
sung
dynasty
were
many
and
varied
in
style
but
their
work
much
of
it
of
the
very
highest
order
was
becoming
perhaps
a
trifle
more
formal
and
precise
life
seemed
to
be
taken
more
seriously
than
under
the
gay
and
the
long
list
of
sung
poets
includes
such
names
as
ss
u
kuang
hsiu
and
wang
to
be
mentioned
by
and
by
the
first
two
as
historians
and
the
last
as
political
reformer
a
still
more
familiar
name
in
popular
estimation
is
that
of
su
partly
known
for
his
romantic
career
now
in
court
favour
now
banished
to
the
wilds
but
still
more
renowned
as
a
brilliant
poet
and
writer
of
fascinating
essays
the
mongols
who
succeeded
the
sungs
and
the
mings
who
followed
the
sungs
and
bring
us
down
to
the
year
helped
indeed
especially
the
mings
to
swell
the
volume
of
chinese
verse
but
without
reaching
the
high
level
of
the
two
great
poetical
periods
then
came
the
present
dynasty
of
manchu
tatars
of
whom
the
same
tale
must
be
told
in
spite
of
two
emperors
hsi
and
lung
both
of
them
poets
and
one
of
them
author
of
a
collection
containing
no
fewer
than
pieces
most
of
which
it
must
be
said
are
but
stanzas
of
no
literary
value
whatever
it
may
be
stated
in
this
connexion
that
whereas
china
has
never
produced
an
epic
in
verse
it
is
not
true
that
all
chinese
poems
are
quite
short
running
only
to
ten
or
a
dozen
lines
at
the
most
many
pieces
run
to
several
hundred
lines
though
the
chinese
poet
does
not
usually
affect
length
one
of
his
highest
efforts
being
the
stanza
known
as
the
in
which
the
words
stop
while
the
sense
goes
on
expanding
in
the
mind
of
the
reader
by
the
suggestive
art
of
the
poet
the
is
the
converse
of
the
epigram
which
ends
in
a
satisfying
turn
of
thought
to
which
the
rest
of
the
composition
is
intended
to
lead
up
it
aims
at
producing
an
impression
which
so
far
from
being
final
is
merely
the
prelude
to
a
long
series
of
visions
and
of
feelings
the
last
of
the
four
lines
is
called
the
surprise
line
but
the
revelation
it
gives
is
never
a
complete
one
the
words
stop
but
the
sense
goes
on
just
as
in
the
pictorial
art
of
china
so
in
her
poetic
art
is
suggestiveness
the
great
end
and
aim
of
the
artist
beginners
are
taught
that
the
three
canons
of
verse
composition
are
lucidity
simplicity
and
correctness
of
diction
yet
some
critics
have
boldly
declared
for
obscurity
of
expression
alleging
that
the
piquancy
of
a
thought
is
enhanced
by
its
skilful
concealment
for
the
foreign
student
it
is
not
necessary
to
accentuate
the
obscurity
and
difficulty
even
of
poems
in
which
the
motive
is
simple
enough
the
constant
introduction
of
classical
allusions
often
in
the
vaguest
terms
and
the
almost
unlimited
licence
as
to
the
order
of
words
offer
quite
sufficient
obstacles
to
easy
and
rapid
comprehension
poetry
has
been
defined
by
one
chinese
writer
as
clothing
with
words
the
emotions
which
surge
through
the
heart
the
chief
moods
of
the
chinese
poet
are
a
pure
delight
in
the
varying
phenomena
of
nature
and
a
boundless
sympathy
with
the
woes
and
sufferings
of
humanity
erotic
poetry
is
not
absent
but
it
is
not
a
feature
proportionate
in
extent
to
the
great
body
of
chinese
verse
it
is
always
restrained
and
never
lapses
from
a
high
level
of
purity
and
decorum
in
his
love
for
hill
and
stream
which
he
peoples
with
genii
and
for
tree
and
flower
which
he
endows
with
sentient
souls
the
chinese
poet
is
perhaps
seen
at
his
very
best
his
views
of
life
are
somewhat
too
deeply
tinged
with
melancholy
and
often
loaded
with
an
overwhelming
sadness
at
the
doubtful
doom
of
human
kind
in
his
lighter
moods
he
draws
inspiration
and
in
his
darker
moods
consolation
from
the
not
to
say
drunkenness
seems
to
have
been
universal
among
chinese
poets
and
a
considerable
amount
of
talent
has
been
expended
upon
the
glorification
of
wine
from
taoist
and
especially
from
buddhist
sources
many
poets
have
obtained
glimpses
to
make
them
less
forlorn
but
it
can
not
be
said
that
there
is
any
definitely
religious
poetry
in
the
chinese
language
one
of
the
labours
undertaken
by
confucius
was
connected
with
a
series
of
ancient
documents
that
is
ancient
in
his
day
now
passing
under
a
collective
title
as
or
and
popularly
known
as
the
canon
or
book
of
history
mere
fragments
as
some
of
these
documents
are
it
is
from
their
pages
of
unknown
date
that
we
can
supplement
the
pictures
drawn
for
us
in
the
odes
of
the
early
civilization
of
china
the
work
opens
with
an
account
of
the
legendary
emperor
yao
who
reigned
and
was
able
by
virtue
of
an
elevated
personality
to
give
peace
and
happiness
to
his
subjects
with
the
aid
of
capable
astronomers
he
determined
the
summer
and
winter
solstices
and
calculated
approximately
the
length
of
the
year
availing
himself
as
required
of
the
aid
of
an
intercalary
month
finally
after
a
glorious
reign
he
ceded
the
throne
to
a
man
of
the
people
whose
only
claim
to
distinction
was
his
unwavering
practice
of
filial
piety
chapter
ii
deals
with
the
reign
of
this
said
man
known
in
history
as
the
emperor
shun
in
accordance
with
the
monotheism
of
the
day
he
worshipped
god
in
heaven
with
prayer
and
burnt
offerings
he
travelled
on
tours
of
inspection
all
over
his
then
comparatively
narrow
empire
he
established
punishments
to
be
tempered
with
mercy
he
appointed
officials
to
superintend
forestry
care
of
animals
religious
observances
and
music
and
he
organized
a
system
of
periodical
examinations
for
public
servants
chapter
iii
is
devoted
to
details
about
the
great
yü
who
reigned
having
been
called
to
the
throne
for
his
engineering
success
in
draining
the
empire
of
a
mighty
inundation
which
early
western
writers
sought
to
identify
with
noah
flood
another
interesting
chapter
gives
various
geographical
details
and
enumerates
the
articles
gold
silver
copper
iron
steel
silken
fabrics
feathers
ivory
hides
brought
in
under
the
reign
of
the
great
yü
as
tribute
from
neighbouring
countries
other
chapters
include
royal
proclamations
speeches
to
troops
announcements
of
campaigns
victoriously
concluded
and
similar
subjects
one
peculiarly
interesting
document
is
the
announcement
against
drunkenness
which
seems
to
have
been
for
so
many
centuries
a
national
vice
and
then
to
have
practically
disappeared
as
such
for
the
past
two
or
three
hundred
years
drunkenness
has
always
been
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
the
announcement
delivered
in
the
century
points
out
that
king
wên
the
founder
of
the
chou
dynasty
had
wished
for
wine
to
be
used
only
in
connexion
with
sacrifices
and
that
divine
favours
had
always
been
liberally
showered
upon
the
people
when
such
a
restriction
had
been
observed
on
the
other
hand
indulgence
in
strong
drink
had
invariably
attracted
divine
vengeance
and
the
fall
and
disruption
of
states
had
often
been
traceable
to
that
cause
even
on
sacrificial
occasions
drunkenness
is
to
be
condemned
when
however
you
high
officials
and
others
have
done
your
duty
in
ministering
to
the
aged
and
to
your
sovereign
you
may
then
eat
to
satiety
and
drink
to
elevation
the
announcement
winds
up
with
an
ancient
maxim
do
not
seek
to
see
yourself
reflected
in
water
but
in
others
whose
base
actions
should
warn
you
not
to
commit
the
same
adding
that
those
who
after
a
due
interval
should
be
unable
to
give
up
intemperate
habits
would
be
put
to
death
it
is
worth
noting
in
concluding
this
brief
notice
of
china
earliest
records
that
from
first
to
last
there
is
no
mention
whatever
of
any
distant
country
from
which
the
people
may
have
originally
come
no
vestige
of
any
allusion
to
any
other
form
of
civilization
such
as
that
of
babylonia
with
its
cuneiform
script
and
tablets
from
which
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
derive
the
civilization
of
china
a
few
odd
coincidences
sum
up
the
chief
argument
in
favour
of
this
now
discredited
theory

of
the
lu
state
the
next
step
lands
us
on
the
confines
though
scarcely
in
the
domain
of
history
properly
so
called
among
his
other
literary
labours
confucius
undertook
to
produce
the
annals
of
lu
his
native
state
and
beginning
with
the
year
he
carried
the
record
down
to
his
death
in
after
which
it
was
continued
for
a
few
years
presumably
by
ming
the
shadowy
author
of
the
famous
commentary
to
which
the
text
is
so
deeply
indebted
for
vitality
and
illumination
the
work
of
confucius
is
known
as
the
the
springs
and
autumns
annals
it
consists
of
a
varying
number
of
brief
entries
under
each
year
of
the
reign
of
each
successive
ruler
of
lu
the
feudal
system
initiated
more
than
four
centuries
previously
and
consisting
of
a
number
of
vassal
states
owning
allegiance
to
a
central
suzerain
state
had
already
broken
hopelessly
down
so
far
as
allegiance
was
concerned
for
some
time
the
object
of
each
vassal
ruler
had
been
the
aggrandizement
of
his
own
state
with
a
view
either
to
independence
or
to
the
hegemony
and
the
result
was
a
state
of
almost
constant
warfare
accordingly
the
entries
in
the
refer
largely
to
covenants
entered
into
between
contracting
rulers
official
visits
from
one
to
another
of
these

their

and

ceremonies
interspersed
with
notices
of
striking
natural
phenomena

as

earthquakes
and
of
important
national
calamities
such
as
floods
drought
and
famine
for
instance
duke

became
ruler
of

in
and
under

find
twelve

of

the

entry
affords
the
earliest
trustworthy
instance
of
a
comet
in
china
a
still
earlier
comet
is
recorded
in
what
is
known
as
the
bamboo
annals
but
the
genuineness
of
that
work
is
disputed
it
will
be
readily
admitted
that
the
written
throughout
in
the
same
style
as
the
quotations
given
would
scarcely
enable
one
to
reconstruct
in
any
detail
the
age
it
professes
to
record
happily
we
are
in
possession
of
the
a
commentary
presumably
by
some
one
named
tso
in
which
the
bald
entries
in
the
work
of
confucius
are
separately
enlarged
upon
to
such
an
extent
and
with
such
dramatic
brilliancy
that
our
commentary
reads
more
like
a
prose
epic
than
a
treatise
consisting
of
a
systematic
series
of
comments
or
annotations
on
the
text
of
a
literary
work
under
its
guidance
we
can
follow
the
intrigues
the
alliances
the
treacheries
the
ruptures
of
the
jealous
states
which
constituted
feudal
china
in
its
picture
pages
we
can
see
as
it
were
with
our
own
eyes
assassinations
battles
heroic
deeds
flights

and
the
sufferings
of
the
vanquished
from
the
retribution
exacted
by

and
witty
sayings
are
scattered
throughout

of
which
are
in
current

at
the
present
day
the
historical
record
history
as
understood
in
europe
and
the
west
began
in
china
with
the
appearance
of
a
remarkable
man
ss
u
who
flourished
was
the
son
of
an
hereditary
grand
astrologer
also
an
eager
student
of
history
and
the
actual
planner
of
the
great
work
so
successfully
carried
out
after
his
death
by
the
time
he
was
ten
years
of
age
ss
u
was
already
well
advanced
with
his
studies
and
at
twenty
he
set
forth
on
a
round
of
travel
which
carried
him
to
all
parts
of
the
empire
entering
the
public
service
he
was
employed
upon
a
mission
of
inspection
to
the
regions
of
ss
u
and
yünnan
in
his
father
died
and
he
stepped
into
the
post
of
grand
astrologer
after
devoting
some
time
and
energy
to
the
reformation
of
the
calendar
he
took
up
the
work
which
had
been
begun
by
his
father
and
which
was
ultimately
given
to
the
world
as
the
or
historical
record
this
was
arranged
under
five
great
headings
namely
l
annals
of
imperial
reigns
chronological
tables
monographs
annals
of
vassal
princes
and
biographies
burning
of
the
books
the
historical
record
begins
with
the
yellow
emperor
who
is
said
to
have
come
to
the
throne
and
to
have
reigned
a
hundred
years
four
other
emperors
are
given
as
belonging
to
this
period
among
whom
we
find
yao
and
shun
already
mentioned
it
was
china
golden
age
when
rulers
and
ruled
were
virtuous
alike
and
all
was
peace
and
prosperity
it
is
discreetly
handled
in
a
few
pages
by
ss
u
who
passes
on
to
the
somewhat
firmer
but
still
doubtful
ground
of
the
early
dynasties
not
however
until
the
chou
dynasty
had
held
sway
for
some
three
hundred
years
can
we
be
said
to
have
reached
a
point
at
which
history
begins
to
separate
itself
definitely
from
legend
in
fact
it
is
only
from
the
century
before
christ
that
any
trustworthy
record
can
be
safely
dated
with
the
century
before
christ
we
are
introduced
to
one
of
the
feudal
princes
whose
military
genius
enabled
him
to
destroy
beyond
hope
of
revival
the
feudal
system
which
had
endured
for
eight
hundred
years
and
to
make
himself
master
of
the
whole
of
the
china
of
those
days
in
he
proclaimed
himself
the
first
emperor
a
title
by
which
he
has
ever
since
been
known
everything
including
literature
was
to
begin
with
his
reign
and
acting
on
the
advice
of
his
prime
minister
he
issued
an
order
for
the
burning
of
all
books
with
the
exception
only
of
works
relating
to
medicine
divination
and
agriculture
those
who
wished
to
study
law
were
referred
for
oral
teaching
to
such
as
had
already
qualified
in
that
profession
to
carry
out
the
scheme
effectively
the
first
emperor
made
a
point
of
examining
every
day
about
lb
weight
of
books
in
order
to
get
rid
of
such
as
he
considered
to
be
useless
and
he
further
appointed
a
number
of
inspectors
to
see
that
his
orders
were
carried
out
the
result
was
that
about
four
hundred
and
sixty
scholars
were
put
to
death
for
having
disobeyed
the
imperial
command
while
many
others
were
banished
for
life
this
incident
is
known
as
the
burning
of
the
books
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
but
for
the
devotion
of
the
literati
chinese
literature
would
have
had
to
make
a
fresh
start
in
as
it
was
books
were
bricked
up
in
walls
and
otherwise
widely
concealed
in
the
hope
that
the
storm
would
blow
over
and
this
was
actually
the
case
when
the
dynasty
collapsed
and
the
house
of
han
took
its
place
in
the
confucian
books
were
subsequently
recovered
from
their
together
with
many
other
works
the
loss
of
which
it
is
difficult
now
to
contemplate
unfortunately
however
a
stimulus
was
provided
not
for
the
recovery
but
for
the
manufacture
of
writings
the
previous
existence
of
which
could
be
gathered
either
from
tradition
or
from
notices
in
the
various
works
which
had
survived
forgery
became
the
order
of
the
day
and
the
modern
student
is
confronted
with
a
considerable
volume
of
literature
which
has
to
be
classified
as
genuine
doubtful
or
spurious
according
to
the
merits
of
each
case
to
the
first
class
belongs
the
bulk
but
not
all
of
the
confucian
canon
to
the
third
must
be
relegated
such
books
as
the

to
be
mentioned
later
on

dying
in

of

only
with
the
opening
reigns
of
the

dynasty
with
which
he
brings
to
a
close
the
first
great
division
of
his
history
the
second
division
consists
of
chronological
tables
the
third
of
eight
monographs
on
the
following
topics
rites
and
ceremonies
music
natural
philosophy
the
calendar
astronomy
religion
and
commerce
on
these
eight
a
few
remarks
may
not
be
out
of
place
the
chinese
seem
to
have
been
in
possession
from
very
early
ages
of
a
systematic
code
of
ceremonial
observances
so
that
it
is
no
surprise
to
find
the
subject
included
and
taking
an
important
place
in
ss
u
work
the
or
book
of
rites
which
now
forms
part
of
the
confucian
canon
is
however
a
comparatively
modern
compilation
dating
only
from
the
century
the
extraordinary
similarities
between
the
chinese
and
pythagorean
systems
of
music
force
the
conclusion
that
one
of
these
must
necessarily
have
been
derived
from
the
other
the
jesuit
fathers
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
the
greeks
borrowed
their
art
from
the
chinese
but
it
is
now
common
knowledge
that
the
chinese
scale
did
not
exist
in
china
until
two
centuries
after
its
appearance
in
greece
the
fact
is
that
the
ancient
chinese
works
on
music
perished
at
the
burning
of
the
books
and
we
are
told
that
by
the
middle
of
the
century
the
hereditary
court
was
altogether
ignorant
of
his
art
what
we
may
call
modern
chinese
music
reached
china
through
bactria
a
greek
kingdom
founded
by
diodotus
in
with
which
intercourse
had
been
established
by
the
chinese
at
an
early
date
the
term
natural
philosophy
can
only
be
applied
by
courtesy
to
this
essay
which
deals
with
twelve
bamboo
tubes
of
varying
lengths
by
means
of
which
coupled
with
the
zodiacal
constellations
and
with
certain
calendaric
accords
divine
communication
is
established
with
the
influences
of
the
five
elements
and
the
points
of
the
compass
corresponding
with
the
eight
winds
in
this
connexion
it
is
worth
noting
that
in
the
chinese
first
adopted
a
cycle
of
nineteen
years
a
period
which
exactly
brings
together
the
solar
and
the
lunar
years
and
further
that
this
very
cycle
is
said
to
have
been
introduced
by
meton
century
and
was
adopted
at
athens
about
probably
reaching
china
via
bactria
some
two
centuries
afterwards
this
chapter
deals
specially
with
the
sun
moon
and
five
planets
which
are
supposed
to
aid
in
the
divine
government
of
mankind
refers
to
the
solemn
sacrifices
to
heaven
and
earth
as
performed
by
the
emperor
upon
the
summit
of
mt
in
refers
to
the
management
of
the
hoang
ho
or
yellow
river
so
often
spoken
of
as
china
sorrow
and
also
of
the
numerous
canals
with
which
the
empire
is
intersected
this
chapter
which
treats
of
the
circulation
of
money
and
its
function
in
the
chinese
theory
of
political
economy
is
based
upon
the
establishment
in
of
certain
officials
whose
business
it
was
to
regularize
commerce
it
was
their
duty
to
buy
up
the
chief
necessaries
of
life
when
abundant
and
when
prices
were
in
consequence
low
and
to
offer
these
for
sale
when
there
was
a
shortage
and
when
prices
would
otherwise
have
risen
unduly
thus
it
was
hoped
that
a
stability
in
commercial
transactions
would
be
attained
to
the
great
advantage
of
the
people
the

of

of

of

princes
to
be
read
in
connexion
with
the
imperial
annals
of
the
first
division
the
final
division
which
is
in
many
ways
the
most
interesting
of
all
gives
biographical
notices
of
eminent
or
notorious
men
and
women
from
the
earliest
ages
downwards
and
enables
us
to
draw
conclusions
at
which
otherwise
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
arrive
confucius
and
mencius
for
instance
stand
out
as
real
personages
who
actually
played
a
part
in
china
history
while
all
we
can
gather
from
the
short
life
of
lao
tz
u
a
part
of
which
reads
like
an
interpolation
by
another
hand
is
that
he
was
a
more
or
less
legendary
individual
whose
very
existence
at
the
date
usually
assigned
to
him
and
centuries
is
altogether
doubtful
scattered
among
these
biographies
are
a
few
notices
of
frontier
nations
of
the
terrible
nomads
known
as
the
whose
identity
with
the
huns
has
now
been
placed
beyond
a
doubt
ss
u
great
work
on
which
he
laboured
for
so
many
vears
and
which
ran
to
five
hundred
and
thousand
five
hundred
words
has
been
described
somewhat
at
length
for
the
following
reason
it
has
been
accepted
as
the
model
for
all
subsequent
dynastic
histories
of
which
have
now
been
published
the
whole
being
produced
in
in
a
uniform
edition
bound
up
in
the
cambridge
library
in
two
hundred
and
nineteen
large
volumes
each
dynasty
has
found
its
historian
in
the
dynasty
which
supplanted
it
and
each
dynastic
history
is
notable
for
the
extreme
fairness
with
which
the
conquerors
have
dealt
with
the
vanquished
accepting
without
demur
such
records
of
their
predecessors
as
were
available
from
official
sources
the
dynasty
offers
in
one
sense
a
curious
exception
to
the
general
rule
it
possesses
two
histories
both
included
in
the
above
series
the
first
of
these
now
known
as
the
old
history
was
ultimately
set
aside
as
inaccurate
and
inadequate
and
a
new
history
was
compiled
by
hsiu
a
distinguished
scholar
poet
and
statesman
of
the
century
nevertheless
in
all
cases
the
scheme
of
the
dynastic
history
has
with
certain
modifications
been
that
which
was
initiated
in
the
century
by
ss
u
the
mirror
of
history
the
output
of
history
however
does
not
begin
and
end
with
the
voluminous
records
above
referred
to
one
of
which
it
should
be
mentioned
was
in
great
part
the
work
of
a
woman
history
has
always
been
a
favourite
study
with
the
chinese
and
innumerable
histories
of
a
character
long
and
short
complete
and
partial
political
and
constitutional
have
been
showered
from
age
to
age
upon
the
chinese
reading
world
space
would
fail
for
the
mere
mention
of
a
tithe
of
such
works
but
there
is
one
which
stands
out
among
the
rest
and
is
especially
enshrined
in
the
hearts
of
the
chinese
people
this
is
the
or
mirror
of
history
so
called
because
to
view
antiquity
as
though
in
a
mirror
is
an
aid
in
the
administration
of
government
it
was
the
work
of
a
statesman
of
the
century
whose
name
by
a
coincidence
was
ss
u
kuang
he
had
been
forced
to
retire
from
office
and
spent
nearly
all
the
last
sixteen
years
of
his
life
in
historical
research
the
mirror
of
history
embraces
a
period
from
the
century
down
to
it
is
written
in
a
picturesque
style
but
the
arrangement
was
found
to
be
unsuited
to
the
systematic
study
of
history
accordingly
it
was
subjected
to
revision
and
was
to
a
great
extent
reconstructed
by
chu
hsi
the
famous
commentator
who
flourished
and
whose
work
is
now
regarded
as
the
standard
history
of
china
in
regard
to
biography
the
student
is
by
no
means
limited
to
the
dynastic
histories
many
huge
biographical
collections
have
been
compiled
and
published
by
private
individuals
and
many
lives
of
the
same
personages
have
often
been
written
from
different
points
of
view
there
is
nothing
very
much
by
which
a
chinese
biography
can
be
distinguished
from
biographies
produced
in
other
parts
of
the
world
the
chinese
writer
always
begins
with
the
place
of
birth
but
he
is
not
so
particular
about
the
year
sometimes
leaving
that
to
be
gathered
from
the
date
of
death
taken
in
connexion
with
the
age
which
the
person
may
have
attained
some
allusion
is
usually
made
to
ancestry
and
the
steps
of
an
official
career
upward
by
promotion
or
downward
by
disgrace
are
also
carefully
noted
and
there
is
a
considerable
volume
of
chinese
literature
which
comes
under
this
head
but
if
we
exclude
certain
brief
notices
of
foreign
countries
there
remains
nothing
in
the
way
of
general
geography
which
had
been
produced
prior
to
the
arrival
of
the
jesuit
fathers
at
the
close
of
the
century
up
to
that
period
geography
meant
the
topography
of
the
chinese
empire
and
of
topographical
records
there
is
a
very
large
and
valuable
collection
every
prefecture
and
department
some
eighteen
hundred
in
all
has
each
its
own
particular
topography
compiled
from
records
and
from
tradition
with
a
fullness
that
leaves
nothing
to
be
desired
the
buildings
bridges
monuments
of
archaeological
interest
in
each
district
are
all
carefully
inserted
side
by
side
with
biographical
and
other
local
details
always
of
interest
to
residents
and
often
to
the
outside
public
an
extensive
general
geography
of
the
empire
was
last
published
in
and
this
was
followed
by
a
chronological
geography
in
fa
hsien
the
chinese
have
always
been
fond
of
travel
and
hosts
of
travellers
have
published
notices
more
or
less
extensive
of
the
different
parts
of
the
empire
and
even
of
adjacent
nations
which
they
visited
either
as
private
individuals
or
in
the
former
case
as
officials
proceeding
to
distant
posts
with
buddhism
came
the
desire
to
see
the
country
which
was
the
home
of
the
buddha
and
several
important
pilgrimages
were
undertaken
with
a
view
to
bring
back
images
and
sacred
writings
to
china
on
such
a
journey
the
buddhist
priest
fa
hsien
started
in
and
after
practically
walking
the
whole
way
from
central
china
across
the
desert
of
gobi
on
to
khoten
and
across
the
hindu
kush
into
india
he
visited
many
of
the
chief
cities
of
india
until
at
length
reaching
calcutta
he
took
ship
and
after
a
most
adventurous
voyage
in
the
course
of
which
he
remained
two
years
in
ceylon
he
finally
arrived
safely
in
with
all
his
books
pictures
and
images
at
a
spot
on
the
coast
of
near
the
modern
german
port
of
hsüan

another
of
these
adventurous
priests
was
hsüan

yüan

who
left
china
on
a
similar
mission
in

returned
in
bringing
with
him
six
hundred
and
buddhist
books
besides
many
images
and
pictures
and
one
hundred
and
fifty
relics
he
spent
the
rest
of
his
life
in
translating
with
the
help
of
other
learned
priests
these
books
into
chinese
and
completed
in
the
important
record
of
his
own
travels
known
as
the
record
of
western
countries
lao
tz
u
even
the
briefest
of
chinese
philosophical
literature
must
necessarily
include
the
name
of
lao
tz
u
although
his
era
as
seen
above
and
his
personality
are
both
matters
of
the
vaguest
conjecture
a
number
of
his
sayings
scattered
over
the
works
of
early
writers
have
been
pieced
together
with
the
addition
of
much
incomprehensible
jargon
and
the
whole
has
been
given
to
the
world
as
the
work
of
lao
tz
u
himself
said
to
be
of
the
century
under
the
title
of
the
tê
the
internal
evidence
against
this
book
is
overwhelming
one
quotation
had
been
detached
from
the
writer
who
preserved
it
with
part
of
that
writer
text
clinging
to
it
of
course
by
an
oversight
further
such
a
treatise
is
never
mentioned
in
chinese
literature
until
some
time
after
the
burning
of
the
books
that
is
about
four
centuries
after
its
alleged
first
appearance
still
after
due
expurgation
it
forms
an
almost
complete
collection
of
such
apophthegms
of
lao
tz
u
as
have
come
down
to
us
from
which
the
reader
can
learn
that
the
author
taught
the
great
doctrine
of
inaction
do
nothing
and
all
things
will
be
done
also
that
lao
tz
u
anticipated
the
christian
doctrine
of
returning
good
for
evil
a
sentiment
which
was
highly
reprobated
by
the
practical
mind
of
confucius
who
declared
that
evil
should
be
met
by
justice
among
the
more
picturesque
of
his
utterances
are
such
paradoxes
as
he
who
knows
how
to
shut
uses
no
bolts
yet
you
can
not
open
he
who
knows
how
to
bind
uses
no

can
not
untie

weak

the
strong
the
soft
overcomes
the
hard
chuang
tz
u
these
and
many
similar
subtleties
of
speech
seem
to
have
fired
the
imagination
of
chuang
tz
u
and
centuries
with
the
result
that
he
put
much
time
and
energy
into
the
glorification
of
lao
tz
u
and
his
doctrines
possessed
of
a
brilliant
style
and
a
master
of
irony
chuang
tz
u
attacked
the
schools
of
confucius
and
mo
ti
see
below
with
so
much
dialectic
skill
that
the
ablest
scholars
of
the
age
were
unable
to
refute
his
destructive
criticisms
his
pages
abound
in
quaint
anecdotes
and
allegorical
instances
arising
as
it
were
spontaneously
out
of
the
questions
handled
and
imparting
a
lively
interest
to
points
which
might
otherwise
have
seemed
dusty
and
dull
he
was
an
idealist
with
all
the
idealist
hatred
of
a
utilitarian
system
and
a
mystic
with
all
the
mystic
contempt
for
a
life
of
mere
external
activity
only
chapters
of
his
work
now
remain
though
so
many
as
are
known
to
have
been
still
extant
in
the
century
and
even
of
these
several
complete
chapters
are
spurious
while
in
others
it
is
comparatively
easy
to
detect
here
and
there
the
hand
of
the
interpolator
what
remains
however
after
all
reductions
has
been
enough
to
secure
a
lasting
place
for
chuang
tz
u
as
the
most
original
of
china
philosophical
writers
his
book
is
of
course
under
the
ban
of
heterodoxy
in
common
with
all
thought
opposed
to
the
confucian
teachings
his
views
as
mystic
idealist
moralist
and
social
reformer
have
no
weight
with
the
aspirant
who
has
his
way
to
make
in
official
life
but
they
are
a
delight
and
even
a
consolation
to
many
of
the
older
men
who
have
no
longer
anything
to
gain
or
to
lose
confucius
confucius
who
imagined
that
his
annals
of
the
lu
state
would
give
him
immortality
has
always
been
much
more
widely
appreciated
as
a
moralist
than
as
an
historian
his
talks
with
his
disciples
and
with
others
have
been
preserved
for
us
together
with
some
details
of
his
personal
and
private
life
and
the
volume
in
which
these
are
collected
forms
one
of
the
four
books
of
the
confucian
canon
starting
from
the
axiomatic
declaration
that
man
is
born
good
and
only
becomes
evil
by
his
environment
he
takes
filial
piety
and
duty
to
one
neighbour
as
his
chief
themes
often
illustrating
his
arguments
with
almost
johnsonian
emphasis
he
cherished
a
shadowy
belief
in
a
god
but
not
in
a
future
state
of
reward
or
punishment
for
good
or
evil
actions
in
this
world
he
rather
taught
men
to
be
virtuous
for
virtue
sake

the
discourses
of
mencius
who
followed
confucius
after
an
interval
of
a
hundred
years
form
another
of
the
four
books
the
remaining
two
of
which
are
short
philosophical
treatises
usually
ascribed
to
a
grandson
of
confucius
mencius
devoted
his
life
to
elucidating
and
expanding
the
teachings
of
the
master
and
it
is
no
doubt
due
to
him
that
the
confucian
doctrines
obtained
so
wide
a
vogue
but
he
himself
was
more
a
politician
and
an
economist
see
below
than
a
simple
preacher
of
morality
and
hence
it
is
that
the
chinese
people
have
accorded
to
him
the
title
of
the
second
sage
he
is
considered
to
have
effectually
snuffed
out
the
heterodox
school
of
mo
ti
a
philosopher
of
the
and
centuries
who
propounded
a
doctrine
of
universal
love
as
the
proper
foundation
for
organized
society
arguing
that
under
such
a
system
all
the
calamities
that
men
bring
upon
one
another
would

tz

century
he
maintained
in
opposition
to
mencius
who
upheld
the
confucian
dogma
and
in
conformity
with
christian
doctrine
that
the
nature
of
man
at
his
birth
is
evil
and
that
this
condition
can
only
be
changed
by
efficient
moral
training

teaching
that
the
nature
of

at

is
neither
good
nor
evil
but
a
mixture
of
both
and
that
development
in
either
direction
depends
wholly
upon
circumstances
tz

there
is
a
voluminous
and
interesting
work
of
doubtful
age
which
passes
under
the
title
of

or
the
philosopher
of
it
is
attributed
to
liu
an
prince
of
who
died
and
who
is
further
said
to
have
written
on
alchemy
but
alchemy
was
scarcely
known
in
china
at
the
date
of
his
death
being
introduced
about
that
time
from
greece
the
author
whoever
he
may
have
been
poses
as
a
disciple
of
lao
tz
u
but
the
speculations
of
lao
tz
u
as
glorified
by
chuang
tz

were
then
rapidly
sinking
into
vulgar
efforts
to
discover
the
elixir
of
life
it
is
very
difficult
in
many
cases
of
this
kind
to
decide
what
books
are
and
what
books
are
not
partial
or
complete
forgeries
in
the
present
instance
the
aid
of
the
a
dictionary
of
the
century
see
below
may
be
invoked
but
not
in
quite
so
satisfactory
a
sense
as
that
in
which
it
will
be
seen
lower
down
to
have
been
applied
to
the

a
quotation
said
to
be
taken
from

u
but
that
quotation
can
not
be
found
in
the
work
under
consideration
it
may
be
argued
that
the
words
in
question
may
have
been
taken
from
another
work
by
the
same
author
but
if
so
it
becomes
difficult
to
believe
that
a
book
more
than
two
hundred
years
old
from
which
the
author
of
the
quoted
should
have
been
allowed
to
perish
without
leaving
any
trace
behind
china
has
produced
its
bentleys
in
considerable
numbers
but
almost
all
of
them
have
given
their
attention
to
textual
criticism
of
the
confucian
canon
and
few
have
condescended
to
examine
critically
the
works
of
heterodox
writers
the
foreign
student
therefore
finds
himself
faced
with
many
knotty
points
he
is
entirely
unable
to
solve
wang
of
wang
a
speculative
and
materialistic
philosopher
banned
by
the
orthodox
for
his
attacks
on
confucius
and
mencius
only
one
work
has
survived
it
consists
of
essays
on
such
topics
as
the
nature
of
things
destiny
divination
death
ghosts
poisons
miracles
criticisms
of
confucius
and
mencius
exaggeration
sacrifice
and
exorcism
according
to
wang
man
endowed
at
birth
sometimes
with
a
good
and
sometimes
with
an
evil
nature
is
informed
with
a
vital
fluid
which
resides
in
the
blood
and
is
nourished
by
eating
and
drinking
its
two
functions
being
to
animate
the
body
and
keep
in
order
the
mind
it
is
the
source
of
all
sensation
passing
through
the
blood
like
a
wave
when
it
reaches
the
eyes
ears
and
mouth
the
result
is
sight
hearing
and
speech
respectively
disturbance
of
the
vital
fluid
leads
to
insanity
without
the
fluid
the
body
can
not
be
maintained
without
the
body
the
fluid
loses
its
vitality
therefore
argues
wang
when
the
body
perishes
and
the
fluid
loses
its
vitality
each
being
dependent
on
the
other
there
remains
nothing
for
immortality
in
a
life
beyond
the
grave
ghosts
he
held
to
be
the
hallucinations
of
disordered
minds
and
miracles
to
be
natural
phenomena
capable
of
simple
explanations
his
indictments
of
confucius
and
mencius
are
not
of
a
serious
character
though
as
regards
the
former
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
chinese
people
will
not
suffer
the
faintest
aspersion
on
the
fair
fame
of
their
great
sage
it
is
related
in
the
that
confucius
paid
a
visit
to
the
notoriously
immoral
wife
of
one
of
the
feudal
nobles
and
that
a
certain
disciple
was
displeased
in
consequence
whereupon
the
master
swore
saying
if
i
have
done
any
wrong
may
the
sky
fall
and
crush
me
wang
points
out
that
the
form
of
oath
adopted
by
confucius
is
unsatisfactory
and
fails
to
carry
conviction
had
he
said
may
i
be
struck
dead
by
lightning
his
sincerity
would
have
been
more
powerfully
attested
because
people
are
often
struck
dead
by
lightning
whereas
the
fall
of
the
sky
is
too
remote
a
contingency
such
a
thing
never
having
been
known
to
happen
within
the
memory
of
man
as
to
mencius
there
is
a
passage
in
his
works
which
states
that
a
thread
of
predestination
runs
through
all
human
life
and
that
those
who
accommodate
themselves
will
come
off
better
in
the
end
than
those
who
try
to
oppose
it
is
in
fact
a
statement
of
the
greek
ouk
uper
moron
principle
on
this
wang
remarks
that
the
will
of
god
is
consequently
made
to
depend
on
human
actions
and
he
further
strengthens
his
objection
by
showing
that
the
best
men
have
often
fared
worst
for
instance
confucius
never
became
emperor

and

book
of

but
the
tale
of
chinese
philosophers
is
a
long
one
it
is
a
department
of
literature
in
which
the
leading
scholars
of
all
ages
have
mostly
had
something
to
say
the
great
chu
hsi
whose
fame
is
chiefly
perhaps
that
of
a
commentator
and
whose
monument
is
his
uniform
exegesis
of
the
confucian
canon
was
also
a
voluminous
writer
on
philosophy
he
took
a
hand
in
the
mystery
which
surrounds
the
or
generally
known
as
the
book
of
changes
which
is
held
by
some
to
be
the
oldest
chinese
work
and
which
forms
part
of
the
confucian
canon
it
is
ascribed
to
king
wên
the
virtual
founder
of
the
chou
dynasty
whose
son
became
the
first
sovereign
and
posthumously
raised
his
father
to
kingly
rank
it
contains
a
fanciful
system
of
divination
deduced
originally
from
eight
diagrams
consisting
of
triplet
combinations
of
a
line
and
a
broken
line
either
one
of
which
is
necessarily
repeated
twice
and
in
two
cases
three
times
in
the
same
combination
thus
there
may
be
three
lines

or
three
broken
lines

and
other
such
combinations
as

confucius
declared
that
he
would
like
to
give
another
fifty
years
to
the
elucidation
of
this
puzzling

sought
the
key
in
numbers
in
the
eternal
fitness
of

but
chu
hsi
alone
says
a
writer
of
the
century
was
able
to
pierce
through
the
meaning
and
appropriate
the
thoughts
of
the
inspired
man
who
composed
it
no
foreigner
however
has
been
able
quite
to
understand
what
chu

did
make
of
it
and
several
have
gone
so
far
as
to
set
all
native
interpretations
aside
in
favour
of
their
own
thus
the
has
been
discovered
by
one
to
be
a
calendar
of
the
lunar
year
by
another
to
contain
a
system
of
phallic
worship
and
by
a
third
to
be
a
vocabulary
of
the
language
of
a
tribe
whose
very
existence
had
to
be
postulated
for
the
purpose
kuan

this
department
of
literature
has
been
by
no
means
neglected
by
chinese
writers
so
early
as
the
century
we
find
kuan
chung
the
prime
minister
of
the
state
devoting
his
attention
to
economic
problems
and
thereby
making
that
state
the
wealthiest
and
the
strongest
of
all
the
feudal
kingdoms
beginning
life
as
a
merchant
he
passed
into
the
public
service
and
left
behind
him
at
death
a
large
work
parts
of
which
as
we
now
possess
it
may
possibly
have
come
direct
from
his
own
hand
the
remainder
being
written
up
at
a
later
date
in
accordance
with
the
principles
he
inculcated
his
ideal
state
was
divided
into
parts
fifteen
of
which
were
allotted
to
officials
and
agriculturists
and
six
to
manufacturers
and
traders
his
great
idea
was
to
make
his
own
state
and
accordingly
he
fostered
agriculture
in
order
to
be
independent
in
time
of
war
and
manufactures
in
order
to
increase
his
country
wealth
in
time
of
peace
he
held
that
a
purely
agricultural
population
would
always
remain
poor
while
a
purely
manufacturing
population
would
risk
having
its
supplies
of
raw
material
cut
off
in
time
of
war
he
warmly
encouraged
free
imports
as
a
means
of
enriching
his
countrymen
trusting
to
their
ability
under
these
conditions
to
hold
their
own
against
foreign
competition
he
protected
capital
in
the
sense
that
he
considered
capitalists
to
be
necessary
for
the
development
of
commerce
in
time
of
peace
and
for
the
protection
of
the
state
in
time
of
war
mencius
see
above
was
in
favour
of
heavily
taxing
merchants
who
tried
to
engross
for
the
purpose
of
regrating
that
is
to
buy
up
wholesale
for
the
purpose
of
retailing
at
monopoly
prices
he
was
in
fact
opposed
to
all
trusts
and
corners
in
trade
he
was
in
favour
of
a
tax
to
be
imposed
upon
such
persons
as
were
mere
consumers
living
upon
property
which
had
been
amassed
by
others
and
doing
no
work
themselves
no
tax
however
was
to
be
exacted
from
who
contributed
by
their
personal
efforts
to
the
general
welfare
of
the
community
the
object
of
the
tax
was
not
revenue
but
the
prevention
of
idleness
with
its
attendant
evil
consequences
to
the
state
wang
wang
the
reformer
or
innovator
as
he
has
been
called
flourished
in
he
was
appointed
state
councillor
and
forthwith
entered
upon
a
series
of
startling
reforms
which
have
given
him
a
unique
position
in
the
annals
of
china
he
established
a
state
monopoly
in
commerce
under
which
the
produce
of
a
district
was
to
be
used
first
for
the
payment
of
taxes
then
for
the
direct
use
of
the
district
itself
and
the
remainder
was
to
be
purchased
by
the
government
at
a
cheap
rate
either
to
be
held
until
there
was
a
rise
in
price
or
to
be
transported
to
some
other
district
in
need
of
it
the
people
were
to
profit
by
fixity
of
prices
and
escape
from
further
taxation
and
the
government
by
the
revenue
accruing
in
the
process
of
administration
there
was
also
to
be
a
system
of
state
advances
to
cultivators
of
land
not
merely
to
the
needy
but
to
all
alike
the
loan
was
to
be
compulsory
and
interest
was
to
be
paid
on
it
at
the
rate
of
per
month
the
soil
was
to
be
divided
into
equal
areas
and
taxed
according
to
its
fertility
in
each
case
without
reference
to
the
number
of
inhabitants
contained
in
each
area
all
these
and
other
important
reforms
failed
to
find
favour
with
a
rigidly
conservative
people
and
wang
lived
long
enough
to
see
the
whole
of
his
policy
reversed

speaking

very
remarkable

come
down

the
genuineness

without
accepting
the

attribution
of

it
is
most
probable
that
it
is
a
very
old
book
dating
back
to
several
centuries
before
christ
and
containing
traditional
lore
of
a
still
more
remote
period
the
same
may
be
said
of
certain
works
on
cautery
and
acupuncture
both
of
which
are
still
practised
by
chinese
doctors
and
also
of
works

in

whole
range
of

there
is
nothing
which
can
approach
the
or
sometimes
called
the
herbal
a
title
which
seems
to
have
belonged
to
some
book
of
the
kind
in

the

compiled
by

no
fewer
than
eighteen

the

professes
to
quote
from

mentioned

we
obtain
from
his
extracts
an
insight
into
some
curious
details
it
appears
that
formerly
the
number
of
recognized
drugs
was
three
hundred
and
in
all
corresponding
with
the
days
of

one
hundred

of

were
called

as
entirely
beneficial
to
health
taken
in
any
quantity
or
for
any
time
another
similar
number
were
called
some
of
these
were
poisonous
and
all
had
to
be
used
with
discretion
the
remaining
one
hundred
and
were
all
very

as
might
be

the

occupies
the

in

evidently
of
scythian
origin
there
are
several
important
works
of
the

centuries
in
which
the
history
and
theory
of
music
are
fully
discussed
and

for
the

unimportant
writers

hitherto
almost

works
of
the

majority
of

an
official
character
the
public
interest
in

may
have
long
since
passed
away

they
are
valued
by
the
chinese
as
models
of

contributed

chinese
literature
no
one
ever
thinks
of
publishing
a
book
without
getting
one
or
more
of
his
capable
associates
to
provide
prefaces
which
are
naturally
of
a
laudatory
character
and
always
couched
in
and
obscure
terms

difficulty
of
the
text
being
often
aggravated
by
a
fanciful
and
almost
illegible
script
prefaces
written
by
emperors
many
examples
of
which
may
be
seen
are
of
course
highly
esteemed
and
are
generally
printed
in
coloured
ink
the
next
section
may
comprise
biographical
notices
of
eminent

of
mere
local

although
novels
are
not
regarded
as
an
integral
part
of
literature
proper
it
is
generally
conceded
that
some
novels
may
be
profitably
studied
if
for
no
other
reason
from
the
point
of
view
of
style
with
the
novel
however
we
are
no
longer
on
perfectly
safe
ground
in
regard
to
that
decency
which
characterizes
as
has
been
above
stated
the
vast
mass
of
chinese
literature
chinese
novels
range
in
this
sense
from
the
simplest
and
most
unaffected
tale
of
daily
life
down
to

the
lowest

with
episodes
of
battle
heroism
skilful
strategy
and
all
that
goes
to
make
up
a
stirring
picture
of
strenuous
times
its
author
who
might
almost
have
been
walter
scott
can
not
be
named
for
certain
but
the
work
itself
probably
belongs
to
the
century
a
date
at
which
the
novel
begins
to
make
its
appearance
in
china
previous
to
that
time
there
had
been
current
an
immense
quantity
of
stories
of
various
kinds
but
nothing
like
a
novel
as
we
understand
the
term
from
the
century
onwards
the
growth
of
the
novel
was
continuous
and
finally
in
the
century
a
point
was
reached
which
is
not
likely
to
be
surpassed
the

the
author
of
which
took
pains
for
political
reasons
to
conceal
his
identity

a
creation
of
a
very
high
order
its
plot
is
intricate
and
original
and
the
startlingly
tragic
in
the
course
of
the
story
the
chief
clue
of
which
is
love
woven
in
with
intrigue
ambition
wealth
poverty
and
other
threads
of
human
life
there
occur
no
fewer
than
over
four
hundred
characters
each
one
possessed
of
a
distinctive
personality
drawn
with
marvellous
skill
it
contains
incidents
which
recall
the
licence
tolerated
in
fielding
but
the
coarseness
like
that
of
fielding
is
always
on
the
surface
and
devoid
of
the
ulterior
suggestiveness
of
the
modern
psychological
novel
but
perhaps
no
work
of
fiction
has
ever
enjoyed
such
vogue
among
literary
men
as
a
collection
of
stories
some
graceful
some
weird
written
in
by
sungling
a
disappointed
candidate
at
the
public
examinations
this
collection
known
as

exceedingly
interesting

sidelights

professes
to
smile
at
the

beyond
the
pale

simultaneously
with
the
appearance
of
the
novel
seem
to
have
come
into
existence
in
china
in
the
earliest
ages
there
were
set
dances
by
trained
performers
to
the
accompaniment
of
music
and
singing
and
something
of
the
kind
more
or
less
ornate
as
regards
the
setting
has
always
been
associated
with
solemn
and
festive
occasions
but
not
until
the
days
of
the
mongol
rule
can
the
drama
proper
be
said
to
have
taken
root
and
flourished
in
chinese
soil
the
probability
is
that
both
the
drama
and
the
novel
were
introduced
from
central
asia
in
the
wake
of
the
mongol
conquerors
the
former
is
now
specially
essential
to
the
everyday
happiness
of
the
chinese
people
who
are
perhaps
the
most
confirmed
playgoers
in
the
world
there
is
an
excellent
collection
of
one
hundred
plays
of
the
mongol
dynasty
with
an
illustration
to
each
first
published
in
there
is
also
a
further
large
collection
issued
in
which
contains
a
great
number
of
plays
arranged
under
sixty
headings
according
to
the
style
and
purport
of
each
besides
many
others
there
is
one
famous
play
of
the
mongol
period
which
deals
largely
in
plot
and
passion
and
is
a
great
favourite
with
the
educated
classes
it
is
entitled
hsiang
or
the
story
of
the
western
pavilion
and
as
if
there
was
a
doubt
as
to
the
reception
which
would
be
accorded
to
the
work
a
minatory
sentence
was
inserted
in
the
prolegomena
if
any
one
ventures
to
call
this
book
indecent
he
will
certainly
have
his
tongue
torn
out
in
hell
so
far
as
the
written
play
is
concerned
its
language
is
altogether
unobjectionable
on
the
stage
by
means
of
gag
and
gesture
its
presentation
is
often
unseemly
and
coarse
what
the
chinese
playgoer
delights
in
as
an
amusement
is
a
succession
of
plays
which
are
more
of
the
nature
of
sketches
slight
in
construction
and
generally
weak
in
plot
some
of
them
based
upon
striking
historical
episodes
and
others
dealing
with
a
single
humorous
incident
the
or
nearing
the
standard
is
commonly
classed
as
a
dictionary
and
is
referred
by
native
scholars
generally
to
the
century
the
entries
are
arranged
under
nineteen
heads
to
facilitate
reference
and
explain
a
large
number
of
words
and
phrases
including
names
of
beasts
birds
plants
and
fishes
the
work
is
well
illustrated
in
the
large
modern
edition
but
the
actual
date
of
composition
is
an
entirely
open
question
and
the
insertion
of
woodcuts
must
necessarily
belong
to
a
comparatively
late
age
see
shuo
wên
with
the
or
explanation
of
written
words
we
begin
the
long
list
of
lexicographical
works
which
constitute
such
a
notable
feature
in
chinese
literature
a
scholar
named
hsü
shên
who
died
about
made
an
effort
to
bring
together
and
analyse
all
the
characters
it
was
possible
to
gather
from
the
written
language
as
it
existed
in
his
own
day
he
then
proceeded
to
arrange
these
characters
about
ten
thousand
in
all
on
a
system
which
would
enable
a
student
to
find
a
given
word
without
having
possibly
to
search
through
the
whole
book
to
do
this
he
simply
grouped
together
all
such
as
had
a
common
part
more
or
less
indicative
of
the
meaning
of
each
much
as
though
an
english
dictionary
were
to
consist
of
such
groups
as
and
so
on
and
so
on
hsü
shên
selected
five
hundred
and
forty
of
these
common
parts
or
radicals
see
a
number
which
as
will
be
seen
later
on
was
found
to
be
cumbrously
large
and
under
each
radical
he
inserted
all
the
characters
belonging
to
it
but
with
no
particular
order
or
arrangement
so
that
search
was
still
in
many
cases
quite
a
laborious
task
the
explanations
given
were
chiefly
intended
to
establish
the
pictorial
origin
of
the
language
but
whereas
no
one
now
disputes
this
as
a
general
conclusion
the
steps
by
which
hsü
shên
attempted
to
prove
his
theory
must
in
a
large
number
of
instances
be
dismissed
as
often
inadequate
and
sometimes
ridiculous
nevertheless
it
was
a
great
achievement
and
the
is
still
indispensable
to
the
student
of
the
particular
script
in
vogue
a
century
or
two
before
christ
it
is
also
of
value
in
another
sense
it
may
be
used
with
discretion
in
testing
the
genuineness
of
an
alleged
ancient
document
which
if
an
important
or
document
before
the
age
of
hsü
shên
would
not
be
likely
to
contain
characters
not
given
in
his
work

this
test

over

constructed
on

with
modifications
and
improvements

others
known
as

finals

under

dictionaries
but
before
proceeding
a
rough
attempt
may
be
made
to
exhibit
in
english
terms
the
principle
of
the
phonetic
as
compared
with
the
radical
dictionary
described
above
in
the
spoken
language
there
would
occur
the
word
the
opposite
of
dark
and
this
would
be
expressed
in
writing
by
a
certain
symbol
then
when
it
became
necessary
to
write
down
the
opposite
of
heavy
the
result
would
be
precisely
what
we
see
in
english
but
as
written
words
increased
always
with
a
limited
number
of
vocables
see
this
system
was
found
to
be
impracticable
and
radicals
were
inserted
as
a
means
of
distinguishing
one
kind
of
from
another
but
without
altering
the
original
sound
now
in
the
phonetic
dictionary
the
words
are
no
longer
arranged
in
such
groups
as
according
to
the
radicals
but
in
such
groups
as
according
to
the
phonetics

above
four
being
pronounced
simply
without
reference

the
radical
portion

the
limited
sense
of
the
term
so
in
a
phonetic
dictionary
we
should
have
such
a
group
as
and
so
on
all
the
above
six
being
pronounced
simply
to
return
to
hsi
as
the
lexicon
in
question
is
familiarly
styled
the
total
number
of
characters
given
therein
amounts
to
over
thousand
grouped
no
longer
under
the
five
hundred
and
forty
radicals
of
hsü
shên
but
under
the
much
more
manageable
number
of
two
hundred
and
fourteen
as
already
used
in
earlier
dictionaries
further
as
the
groups
of
characters
would
now
be
more
than
four
times
as
large
as
in
the
they
were
subdivided
under
each
radical
according
to
the
number
of
strokes
in
the
other
or
phonetic
part
of
the
character
thus
adopting
letters
as
strokes
for
the
purpose
of
illustration
we
should
have
in
the
group
of
radical
dog
and
three
strokes
while
and
would
both
be
found
under
radical
dog
with
four
strokes
and
so
on
the
two
hundred
and
fourteen
radicals
are
themselves
arranged
in
groups
according
to
the
number
of
strokes
so
that
it
is
not
a
very
arduous
task
to
turn
up
ordinary
characters
in
a
chinese
dictionary
finally
although
chinese
is
a
monosyllabic
and
language
a
method
has
been
devised
and
has
been
in
use
since
the
century
by
which
the
sound
of
any
word
can
be
indicated
in
a
dictionary
otherwise
than
by
simply
quoting
a
word
of
similar
sound
which
of
course
may
be
equally
unknown
to
the
searcher
thus
the
sound
of
a
word
pronounced
can
be
exhibited
by
selecting
two
words
one
having
the
initial
and
the
other
a
final
the
sound
is
given
as
that
is
ien
l
ing
considering
the
long
unbroken
series
of
years
during
which
chinese
literature
has
always
in
spite
of
many
losses
been
steadily
gaining
in
bulk
it
is
not
astonishing
to
find
that
classical
historical
mythological
and
other
allusions
to
personages
or
events
of
past
times
have
also
grown
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
brain
capacity
even
of
the
most
brilliant
student
designed
especially
to
meet
this
difficulty
there
are
several
handbooks
elementary
and
advanced
which
trace
such
allusions
to
their
source
and
provide
full
and
lucid
explanations
but
even
the
most
extensive
of
these
is
on
a
scale
incommensurate
with
the
requirements
of
the
scholar
again
it
is
due
to
the
emperor
hsi
that
we
possess
one
of
the
most
elaborate
compilations
of
the
kind
ever
planned
and
carried
to
completion
the
wên
yün
or
concordance
to
literature
is
a
key
not
only
to
allusions
in
general
but
to
all
phraseology
including
allusions
idiomatic
expressions
and
other
obscure
combinations
of
words
to
be
found
in
the
classics
in
the
dynastic
histories
and
in
all
poets
historians
essayists
and
writers
of
recognized
eminence
in
their
own
lines
no
attempt
at
explanation
is
given
but
enough
of
the
passage
or
passages
in
which
the
phrase
occurs
is
cited
to
enable
the
reader
to
gather
the
meaning
required
the
trouble
of
course
lies
with
the
arrangement
of
these
phrases
in
a
language
recourse
has
been
had
to
the
rhymes
and
the
five
tones
see
and
all
phrases
which
end
with
the
same
word
form
one
of
a
number
of
groups
which
appear
under
the
same
rhyme
the
rhymes
themselves
being
distributed
over
five
tones
thus
to
find
any
phrase
the
first
point
is
to
discover
what
is
its
normal
rhyme
the
next
is
to
ascertain
the
tone
of
that
rhyme
then
under
this
the
will
be
found
and
under
the
group
will
be
found
the
final
word
of
the
phrase
in
question
it
will
now
only
remain
to
run
through
this
last
group
of
phrases
all
of
which
have
this
same
final
word
and
the
search
so
vast
is
the
collection
will
usually
yield
a
satisfactory
result
the
wên
yün
runs
of
course
to
many
volumes
a
rough
estimate
shows
it
to
contain
over
fifteen
million
words
yuan

ta
tien
in
their
desire
to
bring
together
condensed
yet
precise
information
on
a
large
variety
of
subjects
the
chinese
may
be
said
to
have
invented
the
encyclopaedia
though
not
the
earliest
work
of
this
kind
the
yü
is
the
first
of
any
great
importance
it
was
produced
towards
the
close
of
the
century
under
the
direct
supervision
of
the
emperor
who
is
said
to
have
examined
three
sections
every
day
for
about
a
year
the
total
number
of
sections
being
one
thousand
in
all
arranged
under
headings
another
similar
work
dealing
with
topics
drawn
from
the
lighter
literature
of
china
is
the
kuang
which
was
issued
at
about
the
same
date
as
the
both
of
these
and
especially
the
former
have
passed
through
several
editions
they
help
to
inaugurate
the
great
sung
dynasty
which
for
three
centuries
to
follow
effected
so
much
in
the
cause
of
literature
other
encyclopaedias
differing
in
scope
and
in
plan
appeared
from
time
to
time
but
it
will
be
necessary
to
concentrate
attention
upon
two
only
the
third
emperor
of
the
ming
dynasty
known
as
yung
lo
issued
a
commission
for
the
production
of
a
work
on
a
scale
which
was
colossal
even
for
china
his
idea
was
to
collect
together
all
that
had
ever
been
written
in
the
four
departments
of
the
confucian
canon
history
philosophy
and
general
literature
including
astronomy
geography
cosmogony
medicine
divination
buddhism
taoism
arts
and
handicrafts
and
in
such
an
encyclopaedia
was
laid
before
the
throne
received
the
imperial
approval
and
was
named
lo
ta
or
the
great
standard
of
yung
lo
to
achieve
this
commissioners
with
directors
and
a
staff
of
assistants
had
laboured
for
the
space
of
five
years
its
contents
ran
to
no
fewer
than
separate
sections
to
which
must
be
added
an
index
filling
sections
each
section
contained
about
leaves
making
a
total
of
pages
for
the
whole
work
each
page
consisted
of
sixteen
columns
of
characters
averaging
to
each
column
or
a
total
of
characters
to
which
in
order
to
bring
the
amount
into
terms
of
english
words
about
another
third
would
have
to
be
added
this
extraordinary
work
was
never
printed
as
the
expense
would
have
been
too
great
although
it
was
actually
transcribed
for
that
purpose
and
later
on
two
more
copies
were
made
one
of
which
was
finally
stored
in
peking
and
the
other
with
the
original
in
nanking
both
the
nanking
copies
perished
at
the
fall
of
the
ming
dynasty
and
a
similar
fate
overtook
the
peking
copy
with
the
exception
of
a
few
odd
volumes
at
the
siege
of
the
legations
in
the
latter
was
bound
up
in
volumes
covered
with
yellow
silk
each
volume
being
in
in
length
by
in
breadth
and
averaging
over
in
in
thickness
this
would
perhaps
be
a
fitting
point
to
conclude
any
notice
of
chinese
encyclopaedias
but
for
the
fact
that
the
work
of
yung
lo
is
gone
while
another
encyclopaedia
also
on
a
huge
scale
designed
and
carried
out
sonic
centuries
later
is
still
an
important
work
of
reference
shu
the
shu
chi
was
planned
and
to
a
great
extent
made
ready
under
instructions
from
the
emperor
hsi
see
above
and
was
finally
brought
out
by
his
successor
yung
chêng
intended
to
embrace
all
departments
of
knowledge
its
contents
were
distributed
over
six
leading
categories
which
for
want
of
better
equivalents
may
be
roughly
rendered
by
l
heaven
earth
man
arts
and
sciences
philosophy
and
political
science
these
were
subdivided
into
classes
and
in
the
voluminous
index
which
accompanies
the
work
a
further
attempt
was
made
to
bring
the
searcher
into
still
closer
touch
with
the
individual
items
treated
thus
the
category
heaven
is
subdivided
into
four
classes
namely
again
for
want
of
better
terms
the
sky
and
its
manifestations
the
seasons
astronomy
and
mathematics
and
natural
phenomena
under
these
classes
come
the
individual
items
and
here
it
is
that
the
foreign
student
is
often
at
a
loss
for
instance
class
includes
earth
in
its
cosmogonic
sense
as
the
mother
of
mankind
heaven
in
its
original
sense
of
god
the
dual
principle
in
nature
the
sun
moon
and
stars
wind
clouds
rainbow
thunder
and
lightning
rain
fire
but
earth
is
itself
a
geographical
category
and
all
strange
phenomena
relating
to
many
of
the
items
under
class
are
recorded
under
class
category
no
marked
as
political
science
contains
such
classes
as
ceremonial
music
and
administration
of
justice
alongside
of
handicrafts
making
it
essential
to
study
the
arrangement
carefully
before
it
is
possible
to
consult
the
work
with
ease
such
preliminary
trouble
is
however
well
repaid
the
amount
of
information
given
on
any
particular
subject
being
practically
coextensive
with
what
is
known
about
that
subject
the
method
of
presenting
such
information
with
variations
to
suit
the
nature
of
the
topics
handled
is
to
begin
with
historical
excerpts
chronologically
arranged
these
are
usually
followed
by
sometimes
lengthy
essays
dealing
with
the
subject
as
a
theme
taken
from
the
writings
of
qualified
authors
and
like
all
the
other
entries
also
chronologically
arranged
then
come
elegant
extracts
in
prose
and
verse
in
all
of
which
the
subject
may
be
simply
mentioned
and
not
treated
as
in
the
essays
after
these
follow
minor
notices
of
incidents
historical
and
otherwise
and
all
kinds
of
anecdotes
derived
from
a
great
variety
of
sources
occasionally
single
poetical
lines
are
brought
together
each
contributing
some
thought
or
statement
germane
to
the
subject
expressed
in
elegant
or
forcible
terms
and
also
wherever
practicable
biographies
of
men
and
women
are
inserted
chronological
and
other
tables
are
supplied
where
necessary
as
well
as
a
very
large
number
of
illustrations
many
of
these
being
reproductions
of
woodcuts
from
earlier
works
it
is
said
that
the
shu
chi
was
printed
from
movable
copper
type
cast
by
the
jesuit
fathers
employed
by
the
emperor
hsi
at
peking
also
that
only
a
hundred
copies
were
struck
off
the
type
being
then
destroyed
an
edition
of
the
whole
encyclopaedia
was
issued
at
shanghai
in
this
is
bound
up
in
sixteen
hundred
and
handy
volumes
of
about
two
hundred
pages
each
a
copy
of
the
original
edition
stands
on
the
shelves
of
the
british
museum
and
a
translation
of
the
index
has
recently
been
completed
and
at
the
conclusion
of
this
brief
survey
of
chinese
literature
it
may
well
be
asked
how
such
an
enormous
and
mass
has
been
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
according
to
the
views
put
forth
by
early
chinese
antiquarians
the
first
written
records
were
engraved
with
a
special
knife
upon
bamboo
slips
and
wooden
tablets
the
impracticability
of
such
a
process
as
applied
to
books
never
seems
to
have
dawned
upon
those
writers
and
this
snowball
of
error
started
in
the
century
long
after
the
knife
and
the
tablet
had
disappeared
as
implements
of
writing
continued
to
gather
strength
as
time
went
on
recent
researches
however
have
placed
it
beyond
doubt
that
when
the
chinese
began
to
write
in
a
literary
sense
as
opposed
to
mere
scratchings
on
bones
they
traced
their
characters
on
slips
of
bamboo
and
tablets
of
wood
with
a
bamboo
pencil
frayed
at
one
end
to
carry
the
coloured
liquid
which
stood
in
the
place
of
ink
the
knife
was
used
only
to
erase
so
things
went
on
until
about
when
it
would
appear
that
a
brush
of
hair
was
substituted
for
the
bamboo
pencil
after
which
silk
was
called
into
requisition
as
an
appropriate
vehicle
in
connexion
with
the
more
delicate
brush
but
silk
was
expensive
and
difficult
to
handle
so
that
the
invention
of
paper
in
by
a
eunuch
named
lun
came
as
a
great
boon
although
it
seems
clear
that
a
certain
kind
of
paper
made
from
silk
floss
was
in
use
before
his
date
however
that
may
be
from
the
century
onwards
the
chinese
have
been
in
possession
of
the
same
writing
materials
that
are
in
use
at
the
present
day
in
yung
who
rose
subsequently
to
the
highest
offices
of
state
wrote
out
on
stone
in
red
ink
the
authorized
text
of
the
five
classics
to
be
engraved
by
workmen
and
thus
handed
down
to
posterity
the
work
covered
huge
tablets
of
which
a
few
fragments
are
said
to
be
still
in
existence
a
similar
undertaking
was
carried
out
in
and
the
later
tablets
are
still
standing
at
a
temple
in
the
city
of
fu
shensi
with
the
dynasty
rubbings
of
famous
inscriptions
wherein
the
germ
of
printing
may
be
detected
whether
for
the
style
of
the
composition
or
for
the
calligraphic
excellence
of
the
script
came
very
much
into
vogue
with
scholars
and
collectors
it
is
also
from
about
the
same
date
that
the
idea
of
multiplying
on
paper
impressions
taken
from
wooden
blocks
seems
to
have
arisen
chiefly
in
connexion
with
religious
pictures
and
prayers
the
process
was
not
widely
applied
to
the
production
of
books
until
the
century
when
in
the
confucian
canon
was
printed
for
the
first
time
in
orders
were
issued
for
the
kuang
an
encyclopaedia
extending
to
many
volumes
see
above
to
be
cut
on
blocks
for
printing
movable
types
of
baked
clay
are
said
to
have
been
invented
by
an
alchemist
named
pi
shêng
about
and
under
the
ming
dynasty
these
were
made
first
of
wood
and
later
of
copper
or
lead
but
movable
types
have
never
gained
the
favour
accorded
to
by
means
of
which
most
of
china
great
typographical
triumphs
have
been
achieved
the
process
is
and
always
has
been
the
same
all
over
china
two
consecutive
pages
of
a
book
separated
by
a
column
containing
the
title

of

and

of

where
not

cut
away
with

tools
leaving
the
characters
in

and
of
course
backwards
as
in
the
case
of
european
type
the
block
is
then
inked
and
an
impression
is
taken
off

one
side
of
the
paper
only
this

is
then
folded
down
the
middle
of
the
separating
column
above
mentioned
so
that
the
blank
halves
come
together
leaving
two
pages
of
printed
matter
outside
and
when
enough
sheets
have
been
brought
together
they

form

be
further
wrapped

labelled

it
is
almost
superfluous
to
say
that
the
pages
of

not
be
cut

in
june
a
small
force
of
chinese
troops
were
sent
to
asan
and
japan
duly
informed
of
this
action
replied
by
furnishing
her
minister
at
seoul
with
an
escort
rapidly
following
up
this
step
by
the
despatch
of
about
troops
under
oshima
a
complicated
situation
thus
arose
chinese
troops
were
present
in
korea
by
the
request
of
the
government
to
put
down
rebellion
the
japanese
controlled
the
capital
and
declined
to
recognize
korea
as
a
tributary
of
china
but
she
proposed
that
the
two
powers
should
unite
to
suppress
the
disturbance
and
to
inaugurate
certain
specified
reforms
china
considered
that
the
measures
of
reform
must
be
left
to
korea
herself
the
reply
was
that
japan
considered
the
government
of
korea
lacking
in
some
of
the
elements
which
are
essential
to
responsible
independence
by
the
middle
of
july
war
had
become
inevitable
unless
the
peking
government
were
willing
to
abandon
all
claims
over
korea
and
as
chinese
troops
were
already
in
the
country
by
invitation
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
the
shadowy
suzerainty
would
be
abandoned
at
seoul
the
issue
was
forced
by
the
japanese
minister
who
delivered
an
ultimatum
to
the
korean
government
on
the
of
july
on
the
the
palace
was
forcibly
occupied
meanwhile
china
had
despatched
about
troops
to
the
yalu
river
the
outbreak
of
war
thus
found
the
japanese
in
possession
of
seoul
and
ready
to
send
large
forces
to
korea
while
the
chinese
occupied
asan
about
south
of
the
capital
and
had
a
considerable
body
of
troops
in
manchuria
in
addition
to
those
despatched
to
the
yalu
river
to
japan
the
command
of
the
sea
was
essential
for
the
secure
transport
and
supply
of
her
troops
without
it
the
experience
of
the
war
of
the
century
would
be
repeated
china
too
could
only
utilize
overland
routes
to
korea
by
submitting
to
the
difficulties
and
delays
entailed
to
both
powers
the
naval
question
was
thus
important
by
the
time
war
was
finally
declared
august
hostilities
had
already
begun
on
the
of
july
oshima
set
out
from
seoul
to
attack
the
chinese
at
asan
on
the
he
won
a
victory
at
but
the
chinese
commander
escaped
with
a
considerable
part
of
his
forces
by
a
detour
to
meanwhile
a
portion
of
the
japanese
fleet
had
encountered
some
chinese
warships
and
transports
off
and
scored
an
important
success
sinking
amongst
other
vessels
the
transport
kowshing
july
the
loss
of
more
than
chinese
soldiers
in
this
vessel
materially
lightened
task
the
intention
of
the
chinese
to
crush
their
enemies
between
their
forces
at
asan
and
was
completely
frustrated
and
the
japanese
obtained
control
of
all
southern
korea
reinforcements
from
japan
were
now
pouring
into
korea
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
rival
navies
had
not
yet
tried
conclusions
and
general
nozu
the
senior
japanese
officer
present
soon
found
himself
in
a
position
to
move
on
three
columns
converged
upon
the
place
on
the
of
september
and
in
spite
of
its
strong
walls
carried
it
though
only
after
severe
fighting
nearly
all
the
troops
on
either
side
had
been
conveyed
to
the
scene
of
war
by
sea
though
the
decisive
contest
for
sea
supremacy
was
still
to
be
fought
the
chinese
admiral
ting
with
the
northern
squadron
which
alone
took
part
in
the
war
had
hitherto
remained
inactive
in
and
on
the
other
side
ito
fleet
had
not
directly
interfered
with
the
hostile
transports
which
were
reinforcing
the
troops
on
the
yalu
but
two
days
after
the
battle
of
ting
who
had
conveyed
a
large
body
of
troops
to
the
mouth
of
the
yalu
encountered
the
japanese
fleet
on
his
return
journey
off
on
the
of
september
the
heavy
battleships
and
constituted
the
strongest
element
of
the
chinese
squadron
for
the
japanese
superior
as
they
were
in
every
other
factor
of
success
had
no
vessels
which
could
compare
with
these
in
the
matter
of
protection
ting
advanced
in
a
long
irregular
line
abreast
the
battleships
in
the
centre
the
lighter
vessels
on
the
wings
ito
fast
cruisers
steamed
in
line
ahead
against
the
chinese
right
wing
crushing
their
weaker
opponents
with
their
fire
in
the
end
the
chinese
fleet
was
defeated
and
scattered
but
the
two
heavy
battleships
drew
off
without
serious
injury
this
battle
of
the
yalu
gave
japan
command
of
the
sea
but
ito
continued
to
act
with
great
caution
the
remnants
of
the
vanquished
fleet
took
refuge
in
port
arthur
whence
after
repairs
ting
proceeded
to
the
victory
of
had
cleared
korea
of
the
chinese
troops
but
on
the
lower
yalu
their
own
frontier
large
forces
threatened
a
second
advance
marshal
yamagata
therefore
took
the
offensive
with
his
army
and
on
the
and
of
october
under
great
difficulties
though
without
serious
opposition
from
the
enemy
forced
the
passage
of
the
river
and
occupied
part
of
the
chinese
force
retired
to
the
part
to
and
the
japanese
army
advanced
several
columns
towards
the
mountains
of
manchuria
to
secure
its
conquests
and
prepare
for
a
future
advance
general
tachimi
brigade
occupied
on
the
of
october
on
the
of
november
a
column
from
the
yalu
took
takushan
and
a
few
days
later
a
converging
attack
from
these
two
places
was
made
upon
which
was
abandoned
by
the
chinese
meanwhile
tachimi
skirmishing
with
the
enemy
on
the
mukden
and
roads
found
the
chinese
in
force
a
simultaneous
forward
move
by
both
sides
led
to
the
action
of
november
after
which
both
sides
withdrew
the
chinese
to
the
line
of
the
mountains
covering
and
mukden
with
the
tatar
general
ikotenga
force
strong
on
the
japanese
right
of
and
the
japanese
to
takushan
and
the
difficulties
of
supply
in
the
hills
were
almost
insurmountable
and
no
serious
advance
was
intended
by
the
japanese
until
january
when
it
was
to
be
made
in
with
the
army
this
army
under
marshal
oyama
had
been
formed
in
september
and
at
first
sent
to
chemulpo
as
a
support
to
the
forces
under
yamagata
but
its
chief
task
was
the
siege
and
capture
of
the
chinese
fortress
dockyard
and
arsenal
of
port
arthur
the
peninsula
was
guarded
by
the
walled
city
of
kinchow
and
the
forts
of
dalny
under
the
russian
régime
and
tairen
under
the
japanese
as
well
as
the
fortifications
around
port
arthur
itself
on
the
of
october
the
disembarkation
of
the
army
began
near
and
the
successive
columns
of
the
japanese
gradually
moved
towards
kinchow
which
was
carried
without
difficulty
on
the
of
november
even
less
resistance
was
offered
by
the
modern
forts
of
the
japanese
now
held
a
good
harbour
within
a
few
miles
of
the
main
fortress
here
they
landed
siege
artillery
and
on
the
of
november
the
advance
was
resumed
the
attack
was
made
on
the
at
dawn
yamaji
division
nogi
and
nishi
brigades
after
a
trying
night
march
assaulted
and
carried
the
western
defences
and
moved
upon
the
town
hasegawa
in
the
centre
as
soon
as
yamaji
began
to
appear
in
rear
of
his
opponents
in
the
northern
forts
pushed
home
his
attack
with
equal
success
and
by
practically
all
resistance
was
at
an
end
the
japanese
paid
for
this
important
success
with
but
casualties
meanwhile
the
chinese
general
sung
who
had
marched
from
to
engage
the
army
appeared
before
kinchow
where
he
received
on
the
a
severe
repulse
at
the
hands
of
the
japanese
garrison
marshal
oyama
subsequently
stationed
his
advanced
guard
towards
the
main
body
at
kinchow
and
a
brigade
of
infantry
at
port
arthur
soon
after
this
overtures
of
peace
were
made
by
china
but
her
envoy
a
foreigner
unfurnished
with
credentials
was
not
received
by
the
tokyo
government
the
japanese
army
now
under
general
nozu
at
antung
and
prepared
in
spite
of
the
season
to
move
across
the
mountains
and
on
the
of
december
general
katsura
left
antung
for
his
line
of
march
was
by
and
strong
flank
guards
followed
parallel
routes
on
either
side
the
march
was
accomplished
safely
and
occupied
on
the
of
december
in
the
meantime
tachimi
had
moved
northward
from
in
order
to
distract
the
attention
of
the
chinese
from
and
there
were
some
small
engagements
between
this
force
and
that
of
ikotenga
who
ultimately
retired
beyond
the
mountains
to
sung
had
already
left
to
secure
when
he
heard
of
the
fall
of
that
place
his
communications
with
ikotenga
being
now
severed
he
swerved
to
the
and
established
a
new
base
at
once
on
his
new
line
sung
moved
upon
as
it
was
essential
that
he
should
be
prevented
from
joining
forces
with
ikotenga
general
katsura
marched
out
of
to
fight
him
at
december
the
chinese
displayed
unusual
steadiness
and
it
cost
the
japanese
some
casualties
to
dislodge
the
enemy
the
victors
returned
to
exhausted
with
their
efforts
but
secure
from
attack
for
some
time
to
come
the
advanced
troops
of
the
army
nogi
brigade
were
now
ready
to
advance
and
only
the
garrison
left
behind
by
sung
barred
their
junction
with
katsura
at
january
the
resistance
of
the
chinese
was
almost
as
steady
as
at
and
the
japanese
lost
killed
and
wounded
in
their
successful
attack
in
neither
of
these
actions
was
the
defeated
force
routed
nor
did
it
retire
very
far
on
the
of
january
and
again
on
the

from
the
north
but
was
repulsed
meanwhile
the
army
still
under

had
undertaken
operations
against
the

great
fortress
and
dockyard
of
northern
china
where
admiral
ting
squadron
had
been
refitting
since
the
battle
of
the
yalu

it
was
hoped
that
both
armies
would
accomplish
their
present
tasks
in

dispersed
there
was
nothing

thomas
the
most
famous
of
english
cabinetmakers
the
materials
for
the
biography
of
chippendale
are
exceedingly
scanty
but
he
is
known
to
have
been
the
son
of
thomas
chippendale
and
is
believed
to
have
been
the
father
of
thomas
chippendale
iii
his
father
was
a
and
of
considerable
repute
in
worcester
towards
the
beginning
of
the
century
and
possibly
he
originated
some
of
the
forms
which
became
characteristic
of
his
son
work
thus
a
set
of
chairs
and
settees
was
made
apparently
at
worcester
for
the
family
of
bury
of
knateshill
at
a
period
when
the
great
cabinetmaker
could
have
been
no
more
than
a
boy
which
are
practically
identical
with
much
of
the
work
that
was
being
turned
out
of
the
family
factory
as
late
as
the
of
the
century
side
by
side
with
the
queen
anne
or
early
georgian
feeling
of
the
first
quarter
of
the
century
we
find
the
interlaced
splats
and
various
other
details
which
marked
the
chippendale
style
by
the
elder
chippendale
and
his
son
had
removed
to
london
and
at
the
end
of
the
younger
man
his
father
was
probably
then
dead
established
himself
in
conduit
street
long
acre
whence
in
he
removed
to
no
st
martin
lane
which
with
the
addition
of
the
adjoining
three
houses
remained
his
factory
for
the
rest
of
his
life
in
his
workshops
were
burned
down
in
he
was
elected
a
member
of
the
society
of
arts
in
his
partnership
with
james
ranni
was
dissolved
by
the
latter
death
it
has
always
been
exceedingly
difficult
to
distinguish
the
work
executed
in
chippendale
factory
and
under
his
own
eye
from
that
of
the
many
copyists
and
adapters
who
throughout
the
second
half
of
the
century
the
golden
age
of
english
furniture
plundered
remorselessly
apart
from
his
published
designs
many
of
which
were
probably
never
made
up
we
have
to
depend
upon
the
very
few
instances
in
which
his
original
accounts
enable
us
to
earmark
work
which
was
unquestionably
his
for
claydon
house
the
seat
of
the
verneys
in
buckinghamshire
he
executed
much
decorative
work
and
the
best
judges
are
satisfied
that
the
chinese
bedroom
there
was
designed
by
him
at
harewood
house
the
seat
of
the
earl
of
harewood
in
yorkshire
we
are
on
firmer
ground
the
house
was
furnished
between
and
and
both
robert
adam
and
chippendale
were
employed
upon
it
indeed
there
is
unmistakable
evidence
to
show
that
certain
work
so
closely
characteristic
of
the
adams
that
it
might
have
been
assigned
to
them
without
hesitation
was
actually
produced
by
chippendale
this
may
be
another
of
the
many
indications
that
chippendale
was
himself
an
imitator
or
it
may
be
that
adam
as
architect
prescribed
designs
which
chippendale
cabinetmakers
and
carvers
executed
chippendale
bills
for
this
adam
work
are
still
preserved
stourhead
the
famous
house
of
the
hoares
in
wiltshire
contains
much
undoubted
chippendale
furniture
which
may
however
be
the
work
of
thomas
chippendale
iii
at
rowton
castle
shropshire
chippendale
bills
as
well
as
his
works
still
exist
our
other
main
source
of
information
is
gentleman
and
cabinet
maker
which
was
published
by
thomas
chippendale
in
this
book
the
most
important
collection
of
furniture
designs
issued
up
to
that
time
in
england
contains
one
hundred
and
sixty
engraved
plates
and
the
list
of
subscribers
indicates
that
the
author
had
acquired
a
large
and
distinguished
body
of
customers
the
book
is
of
folio
size
there
was
a
second
edition
in
and
a
third
in
in
the
rather
bombastic
introduction
chippendale
says
that
he
has
been
encouraged
to
produce
the
book
by
persons
of
distinction
and
taste
who
have
regretted
that
an
art
capable
of
so
much
perfection
and
refinement
should
be
executed
with
so
little
propriety
and
elegance
he
has
some
severe
remarks
upon
critics
from
which
we
may
assume
that
he
had
already
suffered
at
their
hands
perhaps
indeed
chippendale
may
have
been
hinted
at
in
the
caustic
remarks
of
isaac
ware
surveyor
to
the
king
who
bewailed
that
it
was
the
misfortune
of
the
world
in
his
day
to
see
an
unmeaning
scrawl
of
c
inverted
and
looped
together
taking
the
place
of
greek
and
roman
elegance
even
in
our
most
expensive
decorations
it
is
called
french
and
let
them
have
the
praise
of
it
the
gothic
shaft
and
chinese
bell
are
not
beyond
nor
below
it
in
poorness
of
imitation
it
is
the
more
likely
that
these
barbs
were
intended
for
chippendale
since
he
was
guilty
not
only
of
many
essays
in
gothic
but
of
a
vast
amount
of
work
in
the
chinese
fashion
as
well
as
in
the
flamboyant
style
of
louis
xv
the
contains
examples
of
each
of
the
manners
which
aroused
the
scorn
of
the
king
surveyor
chippendale
has
even
shared
with
sir
william
chambers
the
obloquy
of
introducing
the
chinese
style
but
he
appears
to
have
done
nothing
worse
than
conquer
as
alexandre
dumas
used
to
call
it
the
ideas
of
other
people
nor
would
it
be
fair
to
the
man
who
whatever
his
occasional
extravagances
and
absurdities
was
yet
a
great
designer
and
a
great
transmuter
to
pretend
that
all
his
chinese
designs
were
contemptible
many
of
them
with
their
geometrical
and
carved
tracery
are
distinctly
elegant
and
effective
occasionally
we
find
in
one
piece
of
furniture
a
combination
of
the
three
styles
which
chippendale
most
affected
at
different
periods
louis
chinese
and
gothic
and
it
can
not
honestly
be
said
that
the
result
is
as
incongruous
as
might
have
been
expected
some
of
his
most
elegant
and
attractive
work
is
derived
directly
from
the
french
and
we
can
not
doubt
that
the
inspiration
of
his
famous
chair
came
directly
from
some
of
the
more
artistic
performances
in
rococo
the
primary
characteristic
of
his
work
is
solidity
but
it
is
a
solidity
which
rarely
becomes
heaviness
even
in
his
most
lightsome
efforts
such
as
the
chair
construction
is
always
the
first
consideration
it
is
here
perhaps
that
he
differs
most
materially
from
his
great
successor
sheraton
whose
ideas
of
construction
were
eccentric
in
the
extreme
it
is
indeed
in
the
chair
that
chippendale
is
seen
at
his
best
and
most
characteristic
from
his
hand
or
his
pencil
we
have
a
great
variety
of
chairs
which
although
differing
extensively
in
detail
may
be
roughly
arranged
in
three
or
four
groups
which
it
would
sometimes
be
rash
to
attempt
to
date
he
introduced
the
cabriole
leg
which
despite
its
antiquity
came
immediately
from
holland
the
claw
and
ball
foot
of
ancient
oriental
use
the
straight
square
uncompromising
early
georgian
leg
the
carved
chinese
leg
the
leg
the
fretwork
leg
which
was
supposed
to
be
in
the
best
gothic
taste
the
inelegant
rococo
leg
with
the
curled
or
hoofed
foot
and
even
occasionally
the
spade
foot
which
is
supposed
to
be
characteristic
of
the
somewhat
later
style
of
hepplewhite
his
were
very
various
his
efforts
in
gothic
were
sometimes
highly
successful
often
they
took
the
form
of
the
tracery
of
a
church
window
or
even
of
an
ovalled
rose
window
his
chinese
backs
were
distinctly
geometrical
and
from
them
he
would
seem
to
have
derived
some
of
the
inspiration
for
the
frets
of
the
glazed
and
cabinets
which
were
among
his
most
agreeable
work
the
most
attractive
feature
of
chippendale
most
artistic
chairs
those
which
originally
derived
from
louis
quinze
models
were
deprived
of
their
rococo
extravagances
is
the
back
which
speaking
generally
is
the
most
elegant
and
pleasing
thing
that
has
ever
been
done
in
furniture
he
took
the
old
solid
or
slightly
pierced
back
and
cut
it
up
into
a
light
openwork
design
exquisitely
carved
for
chippendale
was
a
carver
before
everything
in
a
vast
variety
of
designs
ranging
from
the
elaborate
and
extremely
elegant
if
much
criticized
ribbon
back
to
a
comparatively
plain
but
highly
effective
splat
his
armchairs
however
often
had
solid
or
stuffed
backs
next
to
his
chairs
chippendale
was
most
successful
with
settees
which
almost
invariably
took
the
shape
of
two
or
three
conjoined
chairs
the
arms
backs
and
legs
identical
with
those
which
he
used
for
single
seats
he
was
likewise
a
prolific
designer
and
maker
of
cabinets
and
escritoires
with
doors
glazed
with
fretwork
divisions
some
of
those
which
he
executed
in
the
style
which
in
his
day
passed
for
gothic
are
exceedingly
handsome
and
effective
we
have
too
from
his
hand
many
cases
for
long
clocks
and
a
great
number
of
tables
some
of
them
with
a
remarkable
degree
of
gallic
grace
he
was
especially
successful
in
designing
small
tables
with
fretwork
galleries
for
the
display
of
china
his
mirrors
which
were
often
in
the
chinese
taste
or
extravagantly
rococo
are
remarkable
and
characteristic
in
his
day
the
cabinetmaker
still
had
opportunities
for
designing
and
constructing
the
bedstead
and
some
of
chippendale
most
graceful
work
was
lavished
upon
the
woodwork
of
the
lighter
more
refined
and
less
monumental
which
thanks
in
some
degree
to
his
initiative
took
the
place
of
the
massive
tudor
and
the
funereally
hung
jacobean
bed
from
an
organ
case
to
a
indeed
no
piece
of
domestic
furniture
came
amiss
to
this
astonishing
man
and
if
sometimes
he
was
extravagant
grotesque
or
even
puerile
his
level
of
achievement
is
on
the
whole
exceedingly
high
since
the
revival
of
interest
in
his
work
he
has
often
been
criticized
with
considerable
asperity
but
not
always
justly
chippendale
work
has
stood
the
supreme
test
of
posterity
more
completely
than
that
of
any
of
his
rivals
or
successors
and
unlike
many
men
of
genius
we
know
him
to
have
been
warmly
appreciated
in
his
lifetime
he
was
at
once
an
artist
and
a
prosperous
man
of
business
his
claims
to
distinction
are
summed
up
in
the
fact
that
his
name
has
by
general
consent
been
attached
to
the
most
splendid
period
of
english
furniture
chippendale

remarks
on
the
the
most
important
theoretical
question
concerning
the
amphineura
is
how
far
do
they
represent
the
original
condition
of
the
ancestral
mollusc
that
is
to
say
we
have
to
inquire
which
of
their
structural
features
is
primitive
and
which
modified
their
bilateral
symmetry
is
obviously
to
be
regarded
as
primitive
and
the
nervous
system
shows
an
original
condition
from
which
that
of
the
asymmetrical
twisted
gastropods
can
be
derived
but
in
many
other
features
both
external
and
internal
the
three
principal
divisions
differ
so
much
from
one
another
that
we
have
to
consider
in
the
case
of
each
which
condition
is
the
more
primitive
according
to
paul
pelseneer
the
polyplacophora
are
the
most
archaic
the
aplacophora
being
specialized
in
the
great
reduction
of
the
foot
the
disappearance
of
the
shell
among
the
polyplacophora
showing
both
reductions
in
progress
the
disappearance
of
the
radula
but
it
is
a
widely
recognized
principle
of
morphology
that
a
much
modified
animal
is
by
no
means
modified
to
the
same
degree
in
all
its
organs
a
form
which
is
primitive
on
the
whole
may
show
a
more
advanced
stage
of
evolution
in
some
particular
system
of
organs
than
another
animal
which
is
on
the
whole
more
highly
developed
and
specialized
thus
the
independent
metamerism
of
certain
organs
in
the
chitons
is
not
primitive
but
acquired
within
the
group
the
shell
valves
and
the
ctenidia
and
although
embryology
seems
to
prove
that
the
neomeniomorphs
are
derived
from
forms
with
a
series
of
nevertheless
it
seems
probable
that
the
calcareous
spicules
which
alone
are
present
in
adult
aplacophora
preceded
the
solid
shell
in
evolution
it
is
held
by
some
morphologists
that
the
mollusc
body
is
unsegmented
and
therefore
is
to
be
compared
to
a
single
segment
of
a
chaetopod
or
arthropod
in
this
case
there
should
be
only
one
pair
of
coelomoducts
in
the
adult
the
pair
of
true
nephridia
which
should
also
occur
being
represented
by
the
larval
nephridia
there
should
also
be
only
a
single
coelom
or
a
pair
of
lateral
coelomic
cavities
on
this
view
then
the
aplacophora
are
more
primitive
than
the
polyplacophora
in
the
relations
of
coelom
gonad
and
coelomoducts
and
the
genital
ducts
of
the
chitons
have
arisen
either
by
metameric
repetition
within
the
group
or
by
the
gradual
loss
of
an
original
connexion
between
the
generative
sac
and
the
renal
tube
