this

so
ordered
by
a
resolution

a
young
housekeeper
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
more
than
half
the
disease
which
embitters
the
latter
half
of
life
is
due
to
avoidable
errors
in
diet
and
that
more
mischief
in
the
form
of
actual
disease
of
impaired
vigour
and
of
shortened
life
accrues
to
civilized
man
in
england
and
throughout
central
europe
from
erroneous
habits
of
eating
than
from
the
habitual
use
of
alcoholic
drink
considerable
as
i
know
that
evil
to
be
henry
knowledge
which
subserves
by
preventing
loss
of
health
is
of
primary
importance
we
do
not
contend
that
possession
of
such
knowledge
would
by
any
means
wholly
remedy
the
evil
but
we
do
contend
that
the
right
knowledge
impressed
in
the
right
way
would
effect
much
and
we
further
contend
that
as
the
laws
of
health
must
be
recognized
before
they
can
be
fully
conformed
to
the
imparting
of
such
knowledge
must
precede
a
more
rational
living
cooking
means
the
knowledge
of
medea
and
circe
and
of
calypso
and
helen
and
of
rebekah
and
of
the
queen
of
sheba
it
means
the
knowledge
of
all
fruits
and
herbs
and
balms
and
spices
and
of
all
that
is
healing
and
sweet
in
fields
and
groves
and
savory
in
meats
it
means
carefulness
and
inventiveness
and
watchfulness
and
willingness
and
readiness
of
appliance
it
means
much
tasting
and
no
wasting
it
means
english
thoroughness
and
french
art
and
arabian
hospitality
it
means
in
fine
that
you
are
to
be
perfect
and
always
preface
an
eminent
authority
says
up
to
the
age
of
sixteen
even
a
lucid
statement
of
principles
is
received
by
all
but
a
few
pupils
as
dogma
they
do
not
and
can
not
in
any
adequate
sense
realize
the
reasoning
process
by
which
scientific
conclusions
are
reached
they
are
taught
not
only
facts
but
classifications
and
laws
and
causes
in
relation
to
their
effect
these
are
not
in
the
majority
of
cases
elaborated
by
the
pupil
the
teaching
of
them
accordingly
degenerates
into
a
statement
of
facts
and
the
learning
of
them
into
an
act
of
memory
to
obviate
this
condition
or
to
at
least
neutralize
its
effects
somewhat
is
one
of
the
principal
reasons
for
introducing
domestic
science
into
the
public
school
curriculum
a
science
which
relates
so
closely
to
the
daily
life
that
it
can
not
be
left
to
an
act
of
memory
where
cause
and
effect
are
so
palpable
that
the
pupil
may
readily
arrive
at
an
individual
conclusion
the
aim
of
this
is
to
assist
the
pupil
in
acquiring
a
knowledge
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
correct
living
to
the
regular
school
studies
so
as
to
make
a
practical
use
of
knowledge
already
acquired
arithmetic
plays
an
important
part
in
the
arranging
of
weights
and
measures
in
the
study
of
the
analysis
and
relative
value
of
various
kinds
of
food
in
estimating
the
cost
of
manufactured
products
in
proportion
to
their
market
value
in
the
purchase
of
food
material
etc
history
and
geography
are
closely
allied
to
the
study
of
the
diet
and
customs
of
the
different
countries
with
their
variety
of
climate
and
products
physiology
and
temperance
principles
permeate
the
whole
course
of
study
in
addition
to
these
are
the
direct
lessons
provided
by
the
practice
work
in
neatness
promptness
and
cleanliness
it
will
therefore
be
necessary
to
have
a
wide
general
knowledge
before
entering
upon
a
course
in
domestic
science
owing
to
the
limited
time
allowed
for
this
course
in
the
public
schools
it
will
be
impossible
to
teach
more
than
a
few
of
the
first
principles
governing
each
department
of
the
work
a
knowledge
of
the
constituent
parts
of
the
human
body
the
classification
of
food
and
the
relation
of
each
class
to
the
sustenance
and
repair
of
the
body
simple
recipes
illustrating
the
most
wholesome
and
economical
methods
of
preparing
the
various
kinds
of
food
the
science
of
nutrition
economy
and
hygiene
general
hints
on
household
management
laundry
work
and
care
of
the
sick
to
enter
more
fully
into
the
chemistry
of
food
bacteriology
would
tend
to
cause
confusion
in
the
mind
of
the
average
school
girl
and
possibly
create
a
distaste
for
knowledge
containing
so
much
abstract
matter
this
book
is
not
a
teacher
manual
nor
is
it
intended
to
take
the
place
of
the
teacher
in
any
way
the
normal
training
prescribed
for
teachers
will
enable
them
to
supplement
the
information
contained
herein
by
a
much
more
general
and
comprehensive
treatment
of
the
various
questions
than
would
be
possible
or
judicious
in
a
primary
it
has
been
found
difficult
for
pupils
to
copy
the
recipes
given
with
each
lesson
or
to
write
out
the
instructions
carefully
without
infringing
upon
the
time
which
should
be
devoted
to
practice
work
in
order
to
meet
this
difficulty
also
to
enable
the
pupil
to
work
at
home
under
the
same
rules
which
govern
the
class
work
simple
recipes
are
given
beginning
with
a
class
requiring
a
knowledge
of
heat
and
its
effect
going
on
to
those
requiring
hand
dexterity
before
attempting
the
more
difficult
subjects
after
the
pupils
have
acquired
a
knowledge
of
the
why
and
wherefore
of
the
different
processes
required
in
cooking
they
will
have
little
difficulty
in
following
the
more
elaborate
recipes
given
in
the
numberless
provided
for
household
use
once
the
art
and
it
is
a
fine
art
of
cookery
is
mastered
it
becomes
not
only
a
pleasant
occupation
but
provides
excellent
mental
exercise
thereby
preventing
the
reaction
which
frequently
follows
school
life
the
tables
given
are
to
be
used
for
reference
and
to
be
by
the
pupil
the

suggestions
to
teacher
owing
to
the
limitations
of
a
it
will
be
necessary
for
the
teacher
to
enter
very
carefully
into
all
the
details
of
the
various
questions
to
explain
the
underlying
principles
so
thoroughly
that
the
why
and
the
wherefore
of
every
action
in
the
preparation
of
food
will
be
clearly
understood
she
should
endeavor
to
impress
upon
the
pupils
the
value
of
thoroughly
understanding
the
relation
of
food
to
the
body
in
practice
lessons
frequent
should
be
made
to
the
analysis
of
the
various
foods
as
given
in
the
tables
and
charts
the
first
practice
lesson
should
be
given
on
the
making
and
care
of
a
fire
regulating
dampers
cleaning
stove
etc
the
pupils
should
then
be
taught
the
name
and
place
of
all
the
utensils
special
attention
should
be
given
to
the
explanation
of
weights
and
measures
the
table
of
abbreviations
should
be
memorized
arrange
the
class
work
so
that
each
pupil
may
in
alternation
share
the
duties
of
both
kitchen
work
and
cooking
personal
cleanliness
must
be
insisted
upon
special
attention
should
be
given
to
the
hands
and
nails
the
hair
should
be
carefully
pinned
back
or
confined
in
some
way
and
covered
by
a
cap
a
large
clean
apron
and
a
holder
should
be
worn
while
at
work
never
allow
the
pupils
to
use
a
handkerchief
or
their
aprons
in
place
of
a
holder
untidy
habits
must
not
be
allowed
in
the
set
an
example
of
perfect
order
and
neatness
and
insist
upon
pupils
following
that
example
teach
the
pupils
that
cooking
may
be
done
without
soiling
either
hands
or
clothes
the
pupils
should
do
all
the
work
of
the
except
scrubbing
the
floor
everything
must
be
left
in
perfect
order
at
the
close
of
each
lesson
frequent
are
absolutely
necessary
urge
the
pupils
to
think
for
themselves
and
not
to
rely
upon
the
where
pupils
are
backward
or
have
not
had
previous
practice
in
kitchen
work
give
special
attention
to
their
manner
of
holding
a
knife
or
spoon
in
preparing
articles
for
use
and
in
beating
or
stirring
mixtures
encourage
deftness
and
light
handling
of
kitchen
ware
insist
upon
promptness
and
keeping
within
the
time
limit
both
in
preparing
the
food
and
in
the
cooking
owing
to
the
variety
of
climate
and
markets
it
would
be
impossible
to
arrange
the
lessons
in
the
in
regular
order
a
few
sample
menus
are
given
at
the
back
of
the
book
but
each
teacher
must
be
governed
by
circumstances
in
arranging
the
lessons
for
her
class
for
instance
recipes
without
eggs
should
be
given
in
when
eggs
are
dear
fruits
and
vegetables
must
be
given
in
season
the
recipes
given
in
the
are
suitable
for
class
work
in
some
cases
it
may
be
necessary
to
divide
them
as
the
quantities
given
are
intended
for
home
practice
the
teacher
should
consider
herself
at
liberty
to
substitute
any
recipe
which
she
may
consider
valuable
the
digestibility
of
food
the
effect
of
stimulants
especially
of
tea
and
coffee
the
value
of
fresh
air
should
be
carefully
impressed
upon
the
pupil
the
teacher
must
keep
the
object
of
this
instruction
constantly
before
her
to
other
school
studies
such
as
arithmetic
history
geography
physiology
and
temperance
to
develop
the
mental
in
conjunction
with
the
manual
powers
of
the
children
to
enable
pupils
to
understand
the
reason
for
doing
certain
things
in
a
certain
way
in
other
words
to
work
with
an
intelligent
conception
of
the
value
both
physically
and
hygienically
of
knowing
how
the
daily
duties
should
be
performed
in
order
that
material
may
not
be
needlessly
destroyed
each
class
of
food
should
be
introduced
by
an
experimental
lesson
for
instance
before
giving
a
lesson
in
the
preparation
of
starches
each
pupil
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
learn
how
to
mix
and
stir
the
mixture
over
the
fire
so
as
to
prevent
it
from
burning
or
becoming
lumpy
this
may
be
done
by
using
water
and
common
laundry
starch
or
flour
the
same
test
applies
to
sauces
etc
a
few
cheap
apples
and
potatoes
may
be
used
in
learning
to
pare
these
articles
the
effect
of
cold
and
hot
water
on
albumen
and
tissues
may
be
illustrated
by
the
cheaper
pieces
of
meat
although
the
more
scientific
studies
are
grouped
together
it
does
not
follow
that
they
are
to
be
studied
in
the
order
given
the
teacher
must
arrange
her
lessons
from
the
beginning
so
as
to
include
a
certain
amount
of
the
theory
with
the
practice
work
frequent
reference
should
be
made
during
practice
lessons
to
the
various
chapters
bearing
more
directly
upon
the
science
of
cooking
so
as
to
interest
the
pupil
in
the
theoretical
study
of
the
food
question
the
teacher
should
insist
upon
the
pupils
taking
careful
notes
while
she
is
demonstrating
a
lesson
so
that
they
may
not
be
entirely
dependent
upon
the
which
from
its
limitations
must
simply
serve
as
the
for
further
study
special
attention
must
be
given
to
the
chapter
on
digestion

in
the
public

the
relation
of
food
to
the
body
in
order
to
understand
the
relation
of
food
to
the
sustenance
and
repairing
of
the
body
it
will
be
necessary
to
learn
first
of
what
the
body
is
composed
and
the
corresponding
elements
contained
in
the
food
required
to
build
and
keep
the
body
in
a
healthy
condition
the
following
table
gives
the
approximate
analysis

as
food
contains
all
these
elements
and
as
there
is
constant
wearing
and
repair
going
on
in
the
body
it
will
be
readily
seen
how
necessary
some
knowledge
of
the
relation
of
food
to
the
body
is
in
order
to
preserve
health
hydrogen

oxygen
combined
form

hence
we
find
from
the
above
calculation
that
about
of
the

diamonds
are
nearly
pure

makes
about
of
the
whole

will
burn
in
this
way
the
carbon
taken
into
the
body
as
food
when
combined
with
the
oxygen
of
the
inhaled
air
yields

is
given
out
through

in
the
further
study
of
carbonaceous
foods
their
relation
to
the
body
as
fuel
will
be
more
clearly
understood
as
carbon
is
the
most
important
fuel
element
phosphorus

to
the
table
about

what
is
known
as

hence
the

of
a

in
order
that
the
bones
may
become

in

that

can
not

itself
neither
material
nor
energy
all
must
be
supplied
by
the
food
we
eat

is
transformed
into

material
for
the

therefore
the
object
of
a
course
of
study
dealing
with
the
science
of
this
question
as
it
relates
to
the
daily
life
should
be
to
learn
something
of
how
food
builds
the

repairs
the

yields
heat
and

and
to
teach
the
principles
of

these
include
kreatin
and
allied
compounds
and
are
the
chief
ingredients
of
beef
tea
and
most
meat
extracts
amids
this
term
is
frequently
applied
to
the
nitrogenous
compounds
of
vegetable
foods
and
feeding
stuffs
among
which
are
amido
acids
such
as
aspartic
acid
and
asparagin
some
of
them
are
more
or
less
allied
in
chemical
constitution
to
the
nitrogenous
extractives
of
flesh
fat
of
meat
fat
of
milk
oil
of
corn
wheat
etc
the
ingredients
of
the
ether
extract
of
animal
and
vegetable
foods
and
feeding
stuffs
which
it
is
customary
to
group
together
roughly
as
fats
include
with
the
true
fats
various
other
substances
as
lecithians
and
chlorophylls
sugars
starches
celluloses
gums
woody
fibre
etc
potassium
sodium
calcium
and
magnesium
chlorids
sulphates
and
phosphates
atwater
the
terms
nitrogenous
and
carbonaceous
are
frequently
used
to
designate
the
two
distinct
classes
of
food
viz
the
tissue
builders
and
flesh
formers
fuel
and
force
producers
each
of
these
classes
contains
food
material
derived
from
both
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdom
although
the
majority
of
the
animal
substances
belong
to
the
nitrogenous
and
the
majority
of
the
vegetable
substances
to
the
carbonaceous
group
therefore
for
practical
purposes
we
will
confine
ourselves
to
the
more
general
terms
used
in
atwater
table
uses
of
food
first
food
is
used
to
form
the
materials
of
the
body
and
repair
its
waste
second
to
yield
energy
in
the
form
of
heat
to
keep
the
body
warm
to
provide
muscular
and
other
power
for
the
work
it
has
to
do
in
forming
the
tissues
and
fluids
of
the
body
the
food
serves
for
building
and
repair
in
yielding
energy
it
serves
as
fuel
for
heat
and
power
the
principal
tissue
formers
are
the
albuminoids
these
form
the
of
the
body
they
build
and
repair
the
nitrogenous
materials
as
those
of
muscle
tendon
and
bone
and
supply
the
albuminoids
of
blood
milk
and
other
fluids
the
chief
fuel
ingredients
of
food
are
the
carbohydrates
and
fats
these
are
either
consumed
in
the
body
or
are
stored
as
fat
to
be
used
as
occasion
demands
water
by
referring
to
a
preceding
chapter
we
find
that
water
composes
of
the
entire
body
the
elasticity
of
muscles
cartilage
tendons
and
even
of
bones
is
due
in
great
part
to
the
water
which
these
tissues
contain
the
amount
of
water
required
by
a
healthy
man
in
hours
children
in
proportion
is
on
the
average
between
and
ounces
beside
about
ounces
taken
as
an
ingredient
of
solid
food
thus
making
a
total
of
from
to
ounces
one
of
the
most
universal
dietetic
failings
is
neglect
to
take
enough
water
into
the
system
gilman
thompson
gives
the
following
uses
of
water
in
the
body
it
enters
into
the
chemical
composition
of
the
tissues
it
forms
the
chief
ingredient
of
all
the
fluids
of
the
body
and
maintains
their
proper
degree
of
dilution
by
moistening
various
surfaces
of
the
body
such
as
the
mucous
and
serous
membranes
it
prevents
friction
and
the
uncomfortable
symptoms
which
might
result
from
drying
it
furnishes
in
the
blood
and
lymph
a
fluid
medium
by
which
food
may
be
taken
to
remote
parts
of
the
body
and
the
waste
matter
removed

changes
it

a
distributer

and

these
are
only
a
few

the
uses
of
salts
in

are

for

nutrition
it
is
not
within
the
scope
of
this
book
to
deal
with
the
science
of
nutrition
but
a
few
general
principles
may
be
given
which
concern
the
effect
upon
the
system
of
the
different
classes
of
food
animal
food
requires
a
considerable
quantity
of
oxygen
for
its
complete
combustion
meat
in
general
has
a
more
stimulating
effect
upon
the
system
and
is
more
strengthening
than
vegetable
food
there
is
however
a
tendency
to
eat
too
much
meat
and
when
its
effects
are
not
by
free
outdoor
exercise
it
causes
biliousness
and
sometimes
gout
and
other
troubles
albuminous
foods
can
be
eaten
longer
alone
without
exciting
loathing
than
can
fats
sugars
or
starches
a
carbonaceous
diet
taxes
the
excretory
organs
less
than
animal
food
meat
is
not
necessary
to
life
nitrogenous
food
man
must
have
but
it
need
not
be
in
the
form
of
meat
the
estimate
commonly
given
is
that
meat
should
occupy
and
vegetable
food
of
a
mixed
diet
but
in
many
cases
the
meat
eaten
is
much
in
excess
of
this
allowance
the
proper
association
of
different
foods
always
keeps
healthy
people
in
better
condition
there
are
times
however
when
it
may
be
necessary
to
abstain
from
certain
articles
of
diet
it
may
be
well
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
protein
compounds
can
do
the
work
of
the
carbohydrates
and
fats
in
being
consumed
for
fuel
but
the
carbohydrates
and
fats
can
not
do
the
work
of
protein
in
building
and
repairing
the
tissues
of
the
body
as
already
stated
a
mixed
diet
is
the
only
rational
one
for
man
an
exclusively
vegetable
diet
while
it
may
maintain
a
condition
of
health
for
a
time
eventually
results
in
a
loss
of
strength
and
power
to
resist
disease
therefore
it
is
necessary
to
understand
the
approximate
value
of
each
class
of
food
in
arranging
the
daily
dietary
chapter
iv
food
and
economy
it
has
been
stated
that
a
quart
of
milk
of
a
pound
of
moderately
lean
beef
and
five
ounces
of
wheat
flour
contain
about
the
same
amount
of
nutritive
material
but
we
pay
different
prices
for
them
and
they
have
different
values
for
nutriment
the
milk
comes
nearest
to
being
a
perfect
food
it
contains
all
the
different
kinds
of
nutritive
materials
that
the
body
requires
bread
made
from
wheat
flour
will
support
life
it
contains
all
the
necessary
ingredients
for
nourishment
but
not
in
the
proportion
best
adapted
for
ordinary
use
a
man
might
live
on
beef
alone
but
it
would
be
a
very
and
imperfect
diet
meat
and
bread
together
make
the
essentials
of
a
healthful
diet
in
order
to
give
a
general
idea
of
food
economy
it
will
be
necessary
to
deal
briefly
with
the
functions
of
the
various
food
principles
as
our
bodies
contain
a
great
deal
of
muscle
the
waste
of
which
is
repaired
by
protein
found
in
such
food
as
lean
meat
eggs
cheese
beans
peas
oatmeal
fish
a
supply
of
these
articles
must
be
considered
in
purchasing
the
daily
supply
fatty
tissue
not
muscle
serves
as
fuel
therefore
the
value
of
such
foods
as
butter
cream
oils
is
apparent
carbohydrates
form
fat
and
serve
as
fuel
and
force
producers
these
come
in
the
form
of
starches
sugars
vegetables
and
grains
being
the
most
important
in
being
themselves
burned
to
yield
energy
the
nutrients
protect
each
other
from
being
consumed
the
protein
and
fats
of
body
tissue
are
used
like
those
of
foods
an
important
use
of
the
carbohydrates
and
fats
is
to
protect
protein
muscle
etc
from
consumption
the
most
healthful
food
is
that
which
is
best
fitted
to
the
wants
of
the
user
the
cheapest
food
is
that
which
furnishes
the
largest
amount
of
nutriment
at
the
least
cost
the
best
food
is
that
which
is
both
healthful
and
cheap
by
referring
to
the
various
charts
a
fair
estimate
of
food
values
may
be
obtained
as
will
be
noticed
the
animal
foods
contain
the
most
protein
and
fats
while
the
vegetable
foods
are
rich
in
carbohydrates
a
pound
of
cheese
may
have
pound
of
protein
as
much
as
a
man
at
ordinary
work
needs
for
a
day
sustenance
while
a
pound
of
milk
would
have
only
and
a
pound
of
potatoes
pound
of
protein
the
materials
which
have
the
most
fats
and
carbohydrates
have
the
highest
fuel
value
the
fuel
value
of
a
pound
of
fat
pork
may
reach
calories
while
that
of
a
pound
of
salt
codfish
would
be
only
calories
on
the
other
hand
the
nutritive
material
of
the
codfish
would
consist
almost
entirely
of
protein
while
the
pork
contains
very
little
among
the
vegetable
foods
peas
and
beans
have
a
high
proportion
of
protein
oatmeal
contains
a
large
proportion
also
potatoes
are
low
in
fuel
value
as
well
as
in
protein
because
they
are
water
for
the
same
reason
milk
which
is
water
ranks
low
in
respect
to
both
protein
and
fuel
value
hence
the
reason
why
it
is
not
so
valuable
as
food
for
an
adult
as
many
of
the
other
food
materials
these
few
illustrations
will
help
to
show
the
need
of
an
intelligent
idea
of
food
values
before
attempting
to
purchase
the
supplies
for
family
use
as
a
laboring
man
income
goes
towards
providing
food
it
must
follow
that
such
knowledge
will
help
the
housewife
very
materially
in
securing
the
best
results
from
the

expended

quantity
of

required
the
quantity
of
food
required
to
maintain
the
body
in
a
vigorous
condition
depends
upon
the
following
conditions
climate
and
season
clothing
occupation
age
and
sex
in
civilized
countries
more
food
is
eaten
as
a
rule
than
is
necessary
to
maintain
health
and
strength
climate
and
seasons
influence
the
quantity
of
food
eaten
a
cold
bracing
atmosphere
stimulates
the
appetite
tempts
one
to
exercise
while
a
hot
climate
has
the
contrary
effect
hence
the
need
for
more
or
less
food
abundant
clothing
in
cold
weather
conserves
the
body
heat
less
food
is
therefore
required
to
maintain
life
exercise
and
muscular
work
cause
greater
oxidation
in
the
tissues
and
greater
waste
of
the
muscles
this
must
be
replaced
by
proper
food
outdoor
work
requires
more
food
than
indoor
and
physical
labor
more
than
mental
it
has
been
estimated
that
a
child
of
ten
years
requires
half
as
much
food
as
a
grown
woman
and
one
of
fourteen
an
equal
amount
the
rapidly
growing
active
boy
often
eats
as
much
as
a
man
and
the
man
requires
more
than
the
aged
a
man
of
seventy
years
may
preserve
health
on
a
quantity
which
would
soon
starve
his
grandson
just
what
ingredients
of
the
food
serve
for
nourishment
of
the
brain
and
nerves
and
how
they
do
that
service
are
mysteries
which
have
not
yet
been
solved
brain
and
nerve
contain
the
elements
nitrogen
and
phosphorus
which
are
found
in
protein
compounds
but
not
in
the
true
fats
sugars
and
starches
which
contain
only
carbon
hydrogen
and
oxygen
we
naturally
infer
that
the
protein
compounds
must
be
especially
concerned
in
building
up
brain
and
nerve
and
keeping
them
in
repair
just
how
much
food
the
brain
worker
needs
is
a
question
which
has
not
yet
been
decided
in
general
it
appears
that
a
man
or
a
woman
whose
occupation
is
what
we
call
sedentary
who
is
without
vigorous
exercise
and
does
but
little
hard
muscular
work
needs
much
less
than
the
man
at
hard
manual
labor
and
that
the
brain
worker
needs
comparatively
little
of
carbohydrates
or
fats
many
physicians
physiologists
and
students
of
hygiene
have
become
convinced
that
people
whose
work
is
mental
rather
than
physical
eat
too
much
that
the
diet
of
people
of
this
class
as
a
whole
is
as
well
as
excessive
and
that
the
principal
evil
is
the
use
of
too
much
fat
starch
and
sugar
it
is
well
to
remember
that
it
is
the
quantity
of
food
digested
which
builds
the
body
and
more
injury
is
likely
to
result
from
than
from
a
restricted
diet
hence
the
value
of
having
food
cooked
so
as
to
aid

quality
of

it
is
a
great
mistake
to
think
that
the
best
is
the
cheapest
in
regard
to
the
food
question
that
the
higher
priced
meats
fish
butter
contain
special
virtues
lacking
in
the
cheaper
articles
cooking
is
the
chief
cause
of
this
error
in
no
doubt
a
well
broiled
steak
is
more
appetizing
and
delicate
in
flavor
than
some
of
the
cheaper
cuts
but
in
proportion
to
the
cost
is
not
equal
in
nutritive
value
careful
cooking
and
judicious
flavoring
render
the
cheaper
pieces
of
beef
equally
palatable
that
expensive
food
is
not
necessary
to
maintain
life
has
been
clearly
demonstrated
by
the
traditional
diet
of
the
scotch
people
with
their
oatmeal
and
herring
the
irish
potatoes
and
buttermilk
new

codfish

monotony
of
diet
however
is
not
recommended
for
reasons
given
in
a
previous
chapter
and
in
the
countries
where
a
special
diet
prevails
owing
to
the
climate
nature
of
soil
and
markets
the
results
have
not
warranted
us
in
believing
that
it
is
as
good
as
a
mixed
diet
from
this
necessarily
brief
outline
of
the
food
question
we
have
learned
that
a
knowledge
of
the
requirements
of
the
body
are
absolutely
necessary
in
regulating
a
proper
diet
to
furnish
the
food
principles
in
a
cheap
rather
than
a
dear
form
to
understand
the
art
of
cookery
so
as
to
secure
the
full
nutritive
value
and
at
the
same
time
stimulate
the
appetite
the
value
of
economy
in
regard
to
food
principles
when
the
housekeeper
has
acquired
this
knowledge
she
will
have
covered
the
field
of
food
economy
atwater
says
when
we
know
what
are
the
kinds
and
amount
of
nutritive
substances
our
bodies
need
and
our
food
materials
contain
then
and
not
till
then
shall
we
be
able
to
adjust
our
diet
to
the
demands
of
health
and
purse
cooking
of
food
it
is
sometimes
asked
why
do
we
cook
our
food
as
many
opportunities
will
occur
during
this
course
of
instruction
for
a
comparison
of
the
customs
and
diet
of
the
various
countries
and
the
advance
of
civilization
in
this
direction
we
will
confine
ourselves
to
the
definition
of
the
term
as
it
concerns
ourselves
atkinson
says
that
cooking
is
the
right
application
of
heat
for
the
conversion
of
food
material
as
much
of
our
food
requires
cooking
how
we
shall
cook
it
so
as
to
render
it
more
palatable
more
digestible
and
with
the
greatest
economy
of
time
fuel
and
money
is
an
object
deserving
the
most
careful
attention
the
art
of
cooking
lies
in
the
power
to
develop
certain
flavors
which
are
agreeable
to
the
palate
or
in
other
words
which
make
the
mouth
water
without
interfering
with
the
nutritive
qualities
of
the
food
prepared
to
understand
by
what
method
certain
foods
may
be
rendered
more
digestible
and
to
provide
variety
monotony
of
diet
and
of
flavor
lessens
the
appetite
and
fails
to
stimulate
the
digestive
organs
the
chemical
changes
produced
by
cooking
food
properly
aid
digestion
beside
destroying
any
germs
which
may
be
contained
in
the
food
nearly
all
foods
except
fruit
require
cooking
the
digestibility
of
starch
depends
almost
entirely
upon
the
manner
in
which
it
is
cooked
especially
the
cereal
class
gastric
troubles
are
sure
to
follow
the
use
of
improperly
cooked

methods
the
following
are
the
usual
methods
observed
in
cooking
viz
boiling
stewing
roasting
broiling
frying
braising
baking
steaming
boiling
water
boils
at
a
temperature
of
simmering
should
be
at
a
temperature
of
from
to
when
water
has
reached
the
boiling
point
its
temperature
can
not
be
raised
but
will
be
converted
into
steam
hence
the
folly
of
adding
fuel
to
the
fire
when
water
has
already
reached
the
boiling
point
stewing
stewing
allows
the
juices
of
the
meat
to
become
dissolved
in
water
heated
to
the
simmering
point
the
juices
thus
dissolved
are
eaten
with
the
meat
if
not
injured
by
the
addition
of
rich
sauces
or
fats
this
is
usually
a
very
digestible
method
of
preparing
certain
kinds
of
meat
broiling
broiling
is
cooking
directly
over
the
hot
coals
a
coating
of
coagulated
albumen
is
formed
upon
the
outer
surface
this
coating
prevents
the
evaporation
of
the
juices
which
with
the
extractive
materials
are
retained
and
improve
the
flavor
meat
cooked
in
this
way
has
a
decided
advantage
in
both
flavor
and
nutritive
value
over
that
which
has
been
boiled
or
stewed
there
are
however
only
certain
kinds
of
meat
that
are
suitable
for
broiling
frying
frying
is
cooking
in
hot
fat
the
boiling
point
of
fat
is
far
above
that
of
water
fat
should
not
be
heated
above
as
it
will
then
turn
dark
and
emit
a
disagreeable
odor
fried
food
unless
very
carefully
prepared
is
considered
unwholesome
the
only
proper
method
for
frying
is
to
immerse
the
food
completely
in
a
bath
of
hot
fat
braising
braising
is
cooking
meat
in
a
covered
vessel
surrounded
by
a
solution
of
vegetable
and
animal
juices
in
a
strong
but
not
boiling
temperature
tough
meat
may
be
rendered
very
palatable
and
nutritious
by
cooking
in
this
way
the
cover
of
the
pan
or
kettle
must
fit
closely
enough
to
prevent
evaporation
it
requires
long
steady
cooking
the
flavor
is
improved
by
browning
the
meat
in
either
hot
fat
or
in
a
very
hot
oven
before
braising
baking
baking
is
cooking
in
confined
heat
meat
properly
cooked
in
an
oven
is
considered
by
many
authorities
as
quite
equal
in
delicacy
of
flavor
to
that
roasted
before
a
fire
and
is
equally
digestible
steaming
steaming
is
cooking
food
over
condensed
steam
and
is
an
excellent
method
for
preparing
food
which
requires
long
slow
cooking
puddings
cereals
and
other
glutinous
mixtures
are
often
cooked
in
this
way
it
is
an
economical
method
and
has
the
advantage
of
developing
flavor
without
loss
of
substance
food
preservation
food
is
preserved
by
the
following
processes
drying
smoking
salting
freezing
refrigerating
sealing
addition
of
antiseptic
and
preservative
substances
drying
drying
in
the
sun
and
before
a
fire
is
the
usual
method
employed
by
housekeepers
fruits
and
vegetables
meat
and
fish
may
be
preserved
by
drying
the
latter
with
the
addition
of
salt
smoking
smoking
is
chiefly
applied
to
beef
tongue
bacon
ham
and
fish
which
are
hung
in
a
confined
chamber
saturated
with
wood
smoke
for
a
long
time
until
they
absorb
a
certain
percentage
of
antiseptic
material
which
prevents
the
fat
from
becoming
rancid
and
the
albumen
from
putrefying
well
smoked
bacon
cut
thin
and
properly
cooked
is
a
digestible
form
of
fatty
food
especially
for
tubercular
patients
smoking
improves
the
digestibility
of
ham
salting
salting
is
one
of
the
oldest
methods
of
preserving
food
the
addition
of
a
little
saltpetre
helps
to
preserve
the
color
of
the
meat
brine
is
frequently
used
to
temporarily
preserve
meat
and
other
substances
corned
beef
is
a
popular
form
of
salt
preservation
all
salted
meats
require
long
slow
cooking
they
should
always
be
placed
in
cold
water
and
heated
gradually
in
order
to
extract
the
salt
salt
meats
are
less
digestible
and
not
quite
so
nutritious
as
fresh
meats
freezing
food
may
be
kept
in
a
frozen
condition
almost
indefinitely
but
will
decompose
very
quickly
when
thawed
hence
the
necessity
for
cooking
immediately
frozen
meat
loses
per
cent
of
its
nutritive
value
in
cooking
refrigerating
this
process
does
not
involve
actual
freezing
but
implies
preservation
in
chambers
at
a
temperature
maintained
a
few
degrees
above
freezing
point
this
method
does
not
affect
the
flavor
or
nutritive
value
of
food
so
much
as
freezing
sealing
sealing
is
accomplished
not
only
in
the
process
of

by
covering

matter
animal
foods
contain
nutritive
matter
in
a
concentrated
form
and
being
chemically
similar
to
the
composition
of
the
body
is
doubtless
the
reason
why
they
assimilate
more
readily
than
vegetable
foods
although
the

the
value
of
meat
as
food
is
due
chiefly
to
the
nitrogenous
compound
it
contains
the
most
valuable
being
the
albuminoids
the
gelatinoid
of
meat
is
easily
changed
into
gelatin
by
the
action
of
hot
water
gelatin
when
combined
with
the
albuminoids
and
extractives
has
considerable
nutritive
value
extractives
are
meat
bases
or
rather
meat
which
has
been
dissolved
by
water
such
as
soup
stock
and
beef
tea
the
object
in
cooking
meat
is
to
soften
and
loosen
the
tissue
which
renders
it
more
easily
digested
another
object
is
to
sterilize
or
kill
any
germs
which
may
exist
and
to
make
it
more
palatable
the
digestibility
of

cooking
of

for

general
information
see
recipes
in
boiling
meat
two
principles
must
be
considered
the
softening
of
the
fibre
and
preserving
of
the
juices
if
the
meat
alone
is
to
be
used
it
should
be
placed
in
sufficient
boiling
water
to
completely
cover
and
kept
at
boiling
point
for
at
least
ten
minutes
so
as
to
harden
the
albumen
and
prevent
the
escape
of
the
juices
the
temperature
should
then
be
allowed
to
fall
to
simmering
point
if
the
water
is
kept
boiling
it
will
render
the
meat
tough
and
dry
if
the
juice
is
to
be
extracted
and
the
broth
used
the
meat
should
be
placed
in
cold
water
if
bones
are
added
they
should
be
cut
or
broken
into
small
pieces
in
order
that
the
gelatin
may
be
dissolved
if
the
water
is
heated
gradually
the
soluble
materials
are
more
easily
dissolved
the
albumen
will
rise
as
a
scum
to
the
top
but
should
not
be
skimmed
off
as
it
contains
the
most
nutriment
and
will
settle
to
the
bottom
as
sediment
stewing
if
both
meat
and
broth
are
to
be
used
the
process
of
cooking
should
be
quite
different
in
stewing
the
meat
should
be
cut
into
small
pieces
put
into
cold
water
in
order
that
the
juices
flavoring
material
and
fibre
may
be
dissolved
the
temperature
should
be
gradually
raised
to
simmering
point
and
remain
at
that
heat
for
at
least
three
or
four
hours
the
vessel
being
kept
closely
covered
cooked
in
this
way
the
broth
will
be
rich
and
the
meat
tender
and
juicy
any
suitable
flavoring
may
be
added
this
is
a
good
method
for
cooking
meat
containing
gristle
roasting
and
broiling
when
the
meat
alone
is
to
be
eaten
either
roasting
broiling
or
frying
in
deep
fat
is
a
more
economical
method
as
the
juices
are
saved
the
shrinkage
in
a
roast
of
meat
during
cooking
is
chiefly
due
to
a
loss
of
water
a
small
roast
will
require
a
hotter
fire
than
a
larger
one
in
order
to
harden
the
exterior
and
prevent
the
juices
from
escaping
meat
is
a
poor
conductor
of
heat
consequently
a
large
roast
exposed
to
this
intense
heat
would
become
burned
before
the
interior
could
be
heated
the
large
roast
should
be
exposed
to
intense
heat
for
a
few
minutes
but
the
temperature
should
then
be
reduced

the
idea
of
starchy

is
usually
connected
with
such
substances
as
laundry
starch
cornstarch
arrow
root
etc
these
are
of
course
more
concentrated
forms
of
starch
than
potatoes
rice
etc
many
starchy
foods
contain
other
ingredients
and
some
are
especially
rich
in
proteids
the
following
table
may
help
to
make
this
clear
atwater
percentage
of

buckwheat

it
is
estimated
that
starch
composes
of
peas

and
rye
of
corn
and
rice
of
potatoes
vegetable
proteids
as
already
stated
are
less
easily
digested
than
those
belonging
to
the
animal
kingdom
therefore
it
must
be
remembered
that
a
purely
vegetable
diet
even
though
it
may
be
so
arranged
as
to
provide
the
necessary
protein
is
apt
to
the
digestive
organs
more
than
a
mixed
diet
from
both
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
much
depends
upon
the
cooking
of
the
starchy
foods
in

to
render
them

starch
the
digestion
of
starch
which
is
insoluble
in
cold
water
really
begins
with
the
cooking
which
by
softening
the
outer
coating
or
fibre
of
the
grains
causes
them
to
swell
and
burst
thereby
preparing
them
for
the
chemical
change
which
is
caused
by
the
action
of
the
saliva
in
converting
the
starch
into
a
species
of
sugar
before
it
enters
the
stomach
substances
which
are
insoluble
in
cold
water
can
not
be
absorbed
into
the
blood
therefore
are
not
of
any
value
as
food
until
they
have
become
changed
and
made
soluble
which
overtaxes
the
digestive
organs
and
causes
trouble
the
temperature
of
the
saliva
is
too
low
to
dissolve
the
starch
fibre
unaided
each
of
the
digestive
juices
has
its
own
work
to
do
and
the
saliva
acts
directly
upon
the
starchy
food
hence
the
importance
of
thoroughly
masticating
such
food
as
bread
potatoes
rice
cereals
etc
the
action
of
heat
in
baking
which
causes
the
vapor
to
rise
and
forms
the
crust
of
starchy
food
produces
what
is
called
dextrine
or
partially
digested
starch
dextrine
is
soluble
in
cold
water
hence
the
ease
with
which
crust

toast
when
properly
made
are
digested
it
is
more
important
to
thoroughly
chew
starchy
food

ellen
richards
gives
the
following
explanation
of
what
constitutes
ideal
bread
it
should
retain
as
much
as
possible
of
the
nutritive
principles
of
the
grain
from
which
it
is
made
it
should
be
prepared
in
such
a
manner
as
to
secure
the
complete
assimilation
of
these
nutritive
principles
it
should
be
light
and
porous
so
as
to
allow
the
digestive
juices
to
penetrate
it
quickly
and
thoroughly
it
should
be
nearly
or
quite
free
from
coarse
bran
which
causes
too
rapid
muscular
action
to
allow
of
complete
digestion
this
effect
is
also
produced
when
the
bread
is
sour
bread
is
made
from
a
combination
of
flour
liquid
either
milk
or
water
and
a
vegetable
ferment
called
yeast
see
yeast
recipes
the
yeast
acts
slowly
or
rapidly
according
to
the
temperature
to
which
it
is
exposed
the
starch
has
to
be
changed
by
the
ferment
called
diastase
diastase
is
a
vegetable
ferment
which
converts
starchy
foods
into
a
soluble
material
called
maltose
into
sugar
and
the
sugar
into
alcohol
and
carbonic
acid
gas
carbon
dioxide
when
it
makes
itself
known
by
the
bubbles
which
appear
and
the
gradual
swelling
of
the
whole
mass
it
is
the
effect
of
the
carbonic
acid
gas
upon
the
gluten
which
when
checked
at
the
proper
time
before
the
ferment
becomes
acetic
sour
by
baking
produces
the
sweet
wholesome
bread
which
is
the
pride
of
all
good
housekeepers
the
kneading
of
bread
is
to
break
up
the
gas
bubbles
into
small
portions
in
order
that
there
may
be
no
large
holes
and
the
fermentation
be
equal
throughout
the
loaf
is
baked
in
order
to
kill
the
ferment
to
render
the
starch
soluble
to
expand
the
carbonic
acid
gas
and
drive
off
the
alcohol
to
stiffen
the
gluten
and
to
form
a
crust
which
shall
have
a
pleasant
flavor
much
of
the
indigestibility
of
bread
is
owing
to
the
imperfect
baking
unless
the
interior
of
the
loaf
has
reached
the
sterilizing
point
the
bacteria
contained
in
the
yeast
will
not
be
killed
and
some
of
the
gas
will
remain
in
the
centre
of
the
loaf
the
scientific
method
of
baking
bread
is
to
fix
the
air
cells
as
quickly
as
possible
at
first
this
can
be
done
better
by
baking
the
bread
in
small
loaves
in
separate
pans
thereby
securing
a
uniform
heat
and
more
crust
which
is
considered
to
be
the
most
easily
digested
part
of
the
bread
some
cooks
consider
that
long
slow
baking
produces
a
more
desirable
flavor
and
renders
bread
more
digestible
one
hundred
pounds
of
flour
will
make
an
average
of
one
hundred

pounds
of

this
increase
of
weight
is
due
to
the
addition
of

instantly
bread
as
bread
is
one
of
the
most
important
articles
of
the
daily
diet
it
naturally
follows
that
special
attention
should
be
given
to
a
subject
upon
which
the
health
of
the
family
to
a
great
extent
depends
a
knowledge
of
the
chemical
changes
and
their
effect
see
chap
vii
must
be
understood
before
proficiency
in
can
be
attained
the
first
element
to
consider
is
the
and
the
generating
of
carbonic
acid
gas
so
as
to
have
the
bread
light
tender
and
porous
yeast
is
a
plant
or
vegetable
growth
produced
from
grain
which
has
commenced
to
bud
or
sprout
and
which
forms
the
substance
called
diastase
this
substance
has
the
power
to
convert
starch
into
sugar
see
chap
vii
for
effect
of
yeast
upon
flour
the
temperature
at
which
fermentation
takes
place
and
when
to
check
it
are
important
features
of
the
liquid
milk
or
water
should
be
tepid
when
mixed
as
too
great
heat
destroys
the
growth
of
the
yeast
the
dough
should
rise
in
a
temperature
of
after
fermentation
has
become
active
the
temperature
may
be
gradually
lowered
as
in
setting
bread
over
night
without
injury
avoid
a
cold
draft
or
sudden
change
of
temperature
as
it
checks
fermentation
and
affects
the
flavor
never
allow
bread
to
rise
until
it
settles
or
runs
over
the
side
of
the
bowl
the
usual
rule
is
to
let
it
rise
until
it
is
double
in
bulk
both
in
the
bowl
and
after
it
is
put
into
the
pans
if
it
is
not
convenient
to
bake
the
bread
when
ready
it
may
be
kneaded
again
and
kept
in
a
cool
place
to
prevent
souring
bread
should
be
mixed
in
a
stone
or
granite
bowl
the
only
necessary
ingredients
for
bread
are
water
flour
salt
and
yeast
sugar
may
be
added
to
restore
the
natural
sweetness
of
the
flour
which
has
been
lost
during
fermentation
but
it
is
not
necessary
if
milk
is
used
and
the
bread
well
kneaded
no
other
shortening
is
required
but
with
water
the
addition
of
a
little
butter
or
dripping
makes
the
bread
more
tender
therefore
it
is
more
easily
penetrated
by
the
digestive
fluids
tough
leathery
bread
is
not
easily
digested
no
matter
how
light
it
may
be
as
already
stated
by
the
action
of
heat
the
ferment
is
killed
the
ruptured
the
gas
carried
off
and
the
crust
formed
in
order
that
bread
may
be
thoroughly
cooked
and
plenty
of
crust
formed
each
loaf
should
be
baked
in
a
pan
about
inches
deep
to
inches
wide
and
from
to
inches
long
smaller
loaves
are
even
more
desirable
it
is
very
difficult
to
bake
a
large
loaf
so
as
to
insure
the
escape
of
all
the
carbonic
acid
gas
and
to
cook
the
starch
sufficiently
without
injuring
the
crust
besides
entailing
an
unnecessary
waste
of
fuel
the
custom
of
baking
several
loaves
together
in
one
large
pan
is
contrary
to
all
scientific
rules
of
the
oven
should
be
hot
enough
to
brown
a
spoonful
of
flour
in
five
minutes
for
bread
the
dough
should
rise
during
the
first
fifteen
minutes
then
begin
to
brown
keep
the
heat
steady
for
the
next
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
then
decrease
it
if
the
oven
is
too
hot
a
hard
crust
will
form
and
prevent
the
dough
from
rising
which
will
not
only
cause
the
bread
to
be
heavy
but
will
prevent
the
gas
from
escaping
if
on
the
other
hand
the
oven
is
not
hot
enough
the
bread
will
go
on
rising
until
it
becomes
sour
a
loaf
the
size
already
mentioned
should
take
from
to
sixty
minutes
to
bake
and
should
give
a
hollow
sound
if
tapped
when
removed
from
the
oven
better
take
too
long
than
not
long
enough
as
doughy
bread
is
most
objectionable
and
unwholesome
if
the
crust
is
beginning
to
burn
cover
the
loaf
with
brown
paper
and
reduce
the
heat
but
have
a
brown
crust
not
a
which
is
usually
hard
and
without
flavor
upon
removing
the
loaves
from
the
pans
place
them
on
a
rack

may

serve
very
hot
eggs
while
eggs
are
nutritious
and
valuable
as
food
they
should
not
be
used
too
freely
as
they
are
a
highly
concentrated
form
of
food
the
albumen
white
of
egg
is
one
of
the
most
valuable
tissue
builders
much
depends
upon
the
manner
in
which
they
are
cooked
eggs
fried
in
fat
or
hard
boiled
are
very
indigestible
do
not
use
an
egg
until
it
has
been
laid
some
hours
as
the
white
does
not
become
thick
till
then
and
can
not
be
beaten
stiff
eggs
should
be
kept
in
a
cool
dark
place
and
handled
carefully
in
order
to
avoid
mixing
the
white
and
yolk
which
causes
the
egg
to
spoil
quickly
boiled
eggs
have
the
water
boiling
in
a
saucepan
put
in
the
eggs
and
move
to
the
back
of
the
stove
where
the

will
keep
hot
about
or
for
from
to
minutes
if
the
back
of
the
stove
is
too
hot
move
to
the
hearth
the
white
should
be
of
a
soft
consistency
the
yolks
soft
but
not
liquid
an
egg
to
be
cooked
soft
should
never
be
cooked
in
boiling
water
hard
boiled
eggs
cook
eggs
for
minutes
in
water
just
below
the
boiling
point
the
yolk
of
an
egg
cooked
minutes
is
tough
and
indigestible
minutes
will
make
it
dry
and
mealy
when
it
is
more
easily
penetrated
by
the
gastric
fluid
poached
eggs
have
a
clean
shallow
pan
nearly
full
of
salted
and
boiling
water
remove
the
scum
and
let
the
water
just
simmer
break
each
egg
carefully
into
a
saucer
and
slip
it
gently
into
the
water
dip
the
water
over
it
with
the
end
of
the
spoon
and
when
a
film
has
formed
over
the
yolk
and
the
white
is
like
a
soft
jelly
take
up
with
a
skimmer
and
place
on
a
piece
of
neatly
trimmed

serve
very
cold
fruit
if
people
would

realize
the
value
of
fruit
in
its
natural
state
much
of
the
time
devoted
to
the
preparation
of
pies

be
saved
all
uncooked
fruit
should
be
thoroughly
ripe
and
served
fresh
and
cold
sometimes
fruit
is
more
easily
digested
when
the
woody
fibre
has
been
softened
by
cooking
than
when
in

common
rule
is
to

soups
soups
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
soup
made
with
stock
and
with
milk
as
soup
should
form
part
of
the
regular
daily
diet
and
may
be
made
from
the
cheaper
materials
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
every
housekeeper
should
understand
the
art
of
making
it
properly
in
the
first
place
it
is
well
to
know
what
may
be
used
in
the
process
of
soup
making
the
first
and
most
important
step
is
to
prepare
the
stock
for
this
purpose
have
a
large
earthen
bowl
or
catch
all
as
some
teachers
call
it
into
this
put
all
the
bones
trimmings
bits
of
steak
or
chop
and
gravy
which
has
been
left
over
keep
in
a
cold
place
when
needed
cover
with
cold
water
and
simmer
or
hours
strain
and
set
away
to
cool
when
cold
remove
the
fat
which
will
have
formed
a
solid
coating
on
the
top
the
stock
is
now
ready
for
use
by
saving
the
remains
of
vegetables
cooked
for
the
table
the
outer
stocks
of
celery
a
hard
boiled
egg
a
very
palatable
and
nutritious
soup
may
be
made
at
a
trifling
cost
in
families
where
large
quantities
of
meat
are
used
there
should
be
sufficient
material
without
buying
meat
for
soup
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
all
the
ingredients
mentioned
in
some
recipes
in
order
to
secure
satisfactory
results
it
will
however
be
necessary
to
understand
soup
flavorings
so
as
to
know
which
ones
may
be
left
out
stock
made
from
the
shin
of
beef
or
from
the
cheaper
pieces
which
contain
the
coarser
fibre
and
gristle
require
long
slow
cooking
see
methods
never
soak
meat
in
water
before
cooking
in
any
form
wipe
carefully
with
a
damp
cloth
before
cutting
or
preparing
for
use
for
soup
break
or
saw
the
bones
into
small
pieces
and
for
each
pound
of
meat
and
bone
allow
qt
of
cold
water
cover
the
kettle
closely
and
let
it
heat
slowly
until
it
reaches
the
simmering
point
when
it
should
be
moved
back
and
kept
at
that
degree
for
several
hours
soup
should
never
be
allowed
to
boil
hard
the
scum
which
rises
to
the
surface
is
the
albumen
and
juices
of
the
meat
and
should
not
be
skimmed
off
if
the
kettle
is
clean
and
all
impurities
removed
from
the
meat
there
will
not
be
anything
objectionable
in
the
scum
stock
must
always
be
allowed
to
remain
until
cold
so
that
the
fat
may
be
removed
before
using
a
strong
greasy
soup

rarely
relished
and
is
one
of
the
principal
reasons
why
so
many
people
dislike
this
valuable
article
of
diet
do
not
add
salt
to
the
meat
which
is
being

and
preserving
canning
fruit
is
simply
sterilizing
and
sealing
in
jars
any
fresh
ripe
fruit
may
be
kept
in
this
way
by
observing
a
few
general
rules
any
housekeeper
may
preserve
fruit
successfully
have
good
fruit
ripe
and
fresh
have
jars
test
by
filling
with
water
and
inverting
see
that
the
jars
have
been
well
scalded
and
are
free
from
odor
of
any
kind
have
rims
and
covers
at
hand
so
that
the
jars
may
be
sealed
immediately
when
the
fruit
is
put

to
avoid
breaking
place
carefully
in
the
jars
fill
up
with
syrup
and
seal
at

a
good
method
for
canning
fruit
is
to
cook
the
fruit
in
the
jars
by
placing
them
in
a
boiler
or
kettle
of
water
with
a
wire
frame
or
something
underneath
to
avoid
breaking
fill
the
jar
with
fruit
pour
over
a
syrup
of
the
desired
consistency
screw
on
the
top
loosely
so
as
to
allow
the
gas
to
escape
and
place
in
the
boiler
fill
the
boiler
with
cold
water
up
to
the
rim
of
the
jar
and
bring
slowly
to
boiling
point
allow
small
fruits
to
remain
minutes
and
peaches
pears
minutes
after
the
water
boils
remove
the
tops
fill
to
overflowing
with
boiling
syrup
and
seal

by
this
method
fruit
retains
the
flavor
somewhat
more
than
by
cooking
in
an
open
kettle
an
average
syrup
for
canning
fruit
is
made
by
adding
a
pound
of
sugar
to
a
pint
of
water
see
rule
in
order
to
prevent
fruit
jars
from
cracking
wring
a
cloth
out
of
cold
water
on
which
the
jar
should
be
placed
before
filling
with
the
hot
fruit
or
by
placing
a
silver
spoon
or
fork
in
the
jar
before
putting
in
the
syrup
fruit
or
jelly
always
see
that
the
tops
are
screwed
on
tightly
before
putting
the
jar
away
in
a
cool
place
which
should
not
be
done
until
the
fruit
has
become
cold
preserving
preserving
differs
from
canning
in
the
amount
of

used
otherwise
the
method
is

others
one
of
the
most

may
help
to
make
this
duty
less
objectionable
collect
knives

by
themselves
scrape
the

empty
the

and
arrange
neatly
in
the
order
in
which
they
are
to
be
washed
never
pile
dishes
indiscriminately
in
a

pan
as
each
kind
requires
separate
treatment
have
two
pans
half
full
of
water
one
with

water
the
other
with
clear
hot
water
for
rinsing
wash
the
glassware
first
in
moderately
hot
water
slip
the
glasses
in
sideways
so
that
the
hot
water
may
strike
inside
and
outside
at
once
which
will
prevent
breaking
rinse
and
wipe
at
once
as
they
will
be
much
brighter
and
clearer
than
if
allowed
to

if
the
glass
is
cut
use
a
brush
to
cleanse
out
all
the
grooves
as
it
is
difficult
to
dry
such
glassware
it
should
be
dipped
in
clear
cold
water
after
washing
and
allowed
to
drain
always
keep
the
towel
between
the
hands
and
the
glass
so
as
to
avoid
finger
marks
rinse
glasses
which
have
contained
milk
in
cold
water
before
washing
next
wash
the
silver
and
wipe
at

first
in
the
hot
suds
then
rinse
in
the
clear
hot
water
wipe
while
warm
change
dish
water
often
especially
if
the
dishes
are
greasy
and
do
not
leave
the
soap
in
the

ventilation
and
sanitation
as
pure
air
is
one
of
the
essentials
of
good
health
it
follows
that
one
of
the
chief
duties
of
a
housekeeper
is
to
see
that
the
family
supply
of
this
necessary
element
is
properly
regulated
very
few
housekeepers
realize
the
importance
of
ventilation
in
promoting
the
general
health
and
comfort
of
the
family
as
the
scope
of
this
book
prevents
anything
further
than
a
few
suggestions
or
a
brief
outline
of
the
principles
underlying
these
important
questions
we
will
adopt
the
rule
followed
in
the
preceding
chapter
beginning
with
the
cellar
see
that
surface
water
is
carried
away
from
all
sides
by
either
natural
or
artificial
drains
and
that
the
cellar
is
perfectly
dry
have
enough
windows
in
the
cellar
to
secure
plenty
of
light
and
air
and
see
that
they
are
opened
every
day
have
the
cellar
thoroughly
cleaned
and
whitewashed
with
lime
at
least
once
a
year
twice
if
possible
in
the
spring
and
fall
keep
the
coal
in
a
dry
place
do
not
allow
decomposed
vegetables
or
old
bottles
which
may
cause
unpleasant
odors
to
accumulate
in
the
cellar
unless
there
is
a
special
cellar
for
vegetables
where
they
may
be
kept
at
a
proper
temperature
and
carefully
looked
after
it
is
much
better
for
the
housekeeper
to
purchase
in
small
quantities
remember
the
ventilation
of
the
cellar
is
of
the
greatest
importance
and
should
never
be
neglected
one
of
the
most
noted
authorities
in
america
on
the
question
of
ventilation
says
the
three
important
objects
are
to
provide
an
abundance
of
pure
air
in
every
part
of
the
house
to
avoid
drafts
either
hot
or
cold
to
provide
means
of
escape
for
foul
air
and
odors
as
before
stated
much
of
the
vigor
comfort
and
happiness
of
the
family
depends
upon
attention
to
these
matters
next
to
the
cellar
we
will
take
the
living
and
sleeping
rooms
which
should
be
thoroughly
aired
every
day
not
simply
by
opening
the
window
a
few
inches
at
the
bottom
or
as
in
some
double
or
outside
windows
by
a
little
opening
a
few
inches
wide
but
by
causing
a
circulation
of
air
in
the
room
and
providing
an
outlet
for
foul
air
near
the
ceiling
which
may
be
done
by
lowering
the
window
from
the
top
an
outlet
for
foul
air
is
quite
as
important
as
an
inlet
for
fresh
air
if
there
is
a
skylight
at
the
top
of
the
house
it
should
be
kept
open
a
few
inches
all
the
time
as
an
outlet
for
impure
air
an
attic
window
will
serve
the
same
purpose
have
doors
and
windows
so
arranged
that
a
draft
may
be
made
possible
when
needed
to
change
the
air
of
a
room
quickly
or
in
airing
bedclothes
two
windows
being
of
course
more
desirable
after
dressing
in
the
morning
open
the
window
of
the
sleeping
room
top
and
bottom
turn
back
the
clothes
over
one
or
two
chairs
place
pillows
and

laundry
work
as
the
first
essential
of
laundry
work
is
a
plentiful
supply
of
water
a
word
concerning
that
necessary
article
may
not
be
out
of
place
pure
water
is
a
chemical
compound
of
hydrogen
and
oxygen
it
has
great
absorbent
and
solvent
powers
therefore
pure
water
is
seldom
found
the
first
fall
of
any
shower
is
mixed
with
the
impurities
of
the
air
among
these
may
be
acids
ammonia
and
carbon
in
the
form
of
soot
and
creosote
it
is
these
impurities
which
cause
the
stain
left
when
rain
water
stands
on
the
or
other
finished
wood
rain
water
absorbs
more
or
less
carbon
dioxide
from
various
sources
and
soaking
into
the
soil
often
comes
in
contact
with
lime
magnesia
and
other
compounds
water
saturated
with
carbon
dioxide
will
dissolve
these
substances
forming
carbonates
or
other
salts
which
are
soluble
such
water
is
known
as
hard
water
for
domestic
uses
is
called
either
hard
or
soft
according
to
the
amount
of
salts
which
it
may
contain
when
soap
is
added
to
hard
water
the
new
compound
formed
by
the
union
of
the
lime
with
the
fatty
acid
of
the
soap
is
insoluble
and
is
deposited
upon
the
surface
of
any
article
with
which
it
comes
in
contact
this
is
the
reason
why
hard
water
requires
more
soap
when
used
for
laundry
work
it
is
much
better
to
soften
the
water
by
the
addition
of
alkalies
ammonia
or
before
using
for
laundry
purposes
than
to
depend
entirely
upon
soap
for
cleansing
another
important
material
used
in
the
laundry
is
soap
in
purchasing
soap
it
is
safer
to
choose
the
make
of
some
firm
who
have
a
reputation
to
lose
if
their
products
are
not
good
and
for
anything
stronger
than
soap
it
is
better
to
buy
and
use
it
knowingly
than
to
trust
to
the
various
packages
so
extensively
advertised
washing
soda

always
be

are
the

by
boiling
water
stretch
the
stained
part
over
an
earthen
dish
and
pour
boiling
water
upon
the
stain
until
it
disappears
if
fruit
stains
are
allowed
to
remain
they
will
require
an
acid
or
in
some
cases
a
bleaching
liquid
like
chloride
of
lime
to
remove
them
wine
stains
should
be
immediately
covered
with

these
all

matters
and
are
fixed
by

clear
boiling

will
often
remove

although
it
is
safer
to
sprinkle
the

with
borax
and
soak
in
cold
water
first
an
alkaline
solution
of
great
use
and

the
following
methods
have
proved
successful
and
may
be
tried
where
colors
are
likely
to
be
affected
by
alcohol
molasses
or
a
paste
of
soap
and
cooking
soda
may
be
spread
over
the
stain
and
left
for
some
hours
or
the
stain
may
be
kept
moist
in
the
sunshine
until
the
green
color
has
changed
to
brown
when
it
will
wash
out
in
pure
water
mildew
requires
different
treatment
from
any
previously
considered
strong
soap
suds
a
layer
of
soft
soap
and
pulverized
chalk
or
one
of
chalk
and
salt
are
all
effective
if
in
addition
the
moistened
cloth
be
subjected
to
strong
sunlight
which
kills
the
plant
and
bleaches
the
fibre
javelle
water
may
be
tried
in
cases
of
advanced
growth
but
success
is
not
always
assured
some
of
the
animal
and
vegetable
oils
may
be
taken
out
by
soap
and
cold
water
or
dissolved
in
naphtha
chloroform

etc
some
of
the
vegetable
oils
are
soluble
in
hot
alcohol
care
being
taken
that
the
temperature
be
not
raised
to
the
point
of
igniting
vaseline
stains
should
be
soaked
in
kerosene
before

touch
them
ink
spots
on
white
goods
are
the
same
in
character
as
on
colored
fabrics
where
the
ink
is
an
iron
compound
the
stain
may
be
treated
with
oxalic
muriatic
or
hot
tartaric
acid
applied
in
the
same
manner
as
for
iron
rust
stains
no
definite
rule
can
be
given
for
some
inks
are
affected
by
strong
alkalies
others
by
acids
while
some
will
dissolve
in
clear
water
red
iron
rust
spots
must
be
treated
with
acid
fill
an
earthen
dish
full
of
hot
water
and
stretch
the
stained
cloth
over
this
have
two
other
dishes
with
clear
water
in
one
and
ammonia
water
in
the
other
the
steam
from
the
hot
water
will
furnish
the
heat
and
moisture
favorable
for
chemical
action
drop
a
little
muriatic
acid
on
the
stain
let
it
remain
a
moment
then
lower
the
cloth
into
the
clear
water
repeat
until
the
stain
disappears
rinse
carefully
in
the
clear
water
and
finally
immerse
in
the
ammonia
water
that
any
excess
of
acid
may
be
neutralized
and
the
fabric
protected
salt
and
lemon
juice
are
often
sufficient
for
a
slight
stain
many
spots
appear
upon
white
goods
which
resemble
those
made
by
iron
rust
or
the
fabrics
themselves
acquire
a
yellowish
tinge
this
is
the
result
of
the
use
of
blueing
and
soap
where
the
clothes
have
been
imperfectly
rinsed
therefore
if
all
dirt
is
removed
and
the
clothes
thoroughly
rinsed
from
all
soap
or
alkalies
used
in
removing
the
dirt
and
exposed
for
a
long
time
to
air
and
sunshine
the
use
of
blueing
is
unnecessary
in
cities
where
conveniences
for
drying
and
bleaching
in
the
sunshine
are
few
a
thorough
bleaching
two
or
three
times
a
year
is
a
necessity
but
in
the
country
it
is
wiser
to
abolish
all
use
of
blueing
and
let
the
sun
in
its
action
with
moisture
and
the
oxygen
of
the
air
keep
the
clothes
white
and
pure
freezing
aids
in
bleaching
for
it
retains
the
moisture
upon
which
the
sun
can
act
so
much
longer
when
clean
grass
dew
and
sunshine
are
not
available
use
a
bleaching
powder
directions
for
the
use
of
the
powder
usually
accompany
the
can
in
which
it
is
bought
care
must
be
taken
to
completely
rinse
out
the
acid
present
in
the
powder
grease
is
more
quickly
acted
upon
by
hot
water
than
by
cold
but
other
organic
matter
is
fixed
by
the
hot
water
an
effective
method
is
to
soak
thoroughly
the
most
soiled
portion
of
the
clothes
fold
these
together
towards
the
centre
roll
the
whole
tightly
and
soak
in
cold
water
the
water
should
just
cover
the
articles
in
this
way
the
soap
is
kept
where
it
is
most
needed
and
not
washed
away
before
it
has
done
its
work
when
the
clothes
are
unrolled
the
dirt
may
be
washed
out
with
less
rubbing
too
long
soaking
when
a
strong
soap
is
used
will
weaken
the
fabric
whether
to
boil
clothes
or
not
depends
largely
upon
the
purity
of
the
materials
used
and
the
care
exercised
many
feel
that
the
additional
disinfection
which
boiling
insures
is
an
element
of
cleanness
not
to
be
disregarded
while
others
insist
that
boiling
yellows
the
clothes
this
yellowness
may
be
caused
by
impure
material
in
the
soap
the
deposit
of
iron
from
the
water
or
the
boiler
the
imperfect
washing
of
the
clothes
that
is
the
organic
matter
is
not
thoroughly
removed
the
safer
process
is
to
put
the
clothes
into
cold
water
with
little
or
no
soap
let
the
temperature
rise
gradually
to
boiling
point
and
remain
there
for
a
few
minutes
soap
is
more
readily
dissolved
by
hot
than
by
cold
water
hence
the
boiling
should
help
in
the
complete
removal
of
the
soap
and
should
precede
the
rinsing
one
tablespoonful
of
borax
to
every
gallon
of
water
added
to
each
boilerful
serves
as
a
bleacher
and
disinfectant
scalding
or
pouring
boiling
water
over
the
clothes
is
not
so
effectual
for
their
disinfection
as
boiling
because
the
temperature
is
so
quickly
lowered
the
main
points
in
laundry
cleansing
seem
to
be
the
removal
of
all
stains
soft

a
good
quality
of

the
use

as
possible
ammonia

sometimes
used
in
preference
to

for
pure
white
flannel
borax
is
the
most
satisfactory
on
account
of
its
bleaching
quality
only
enough
of
any

be
used
to
make

therefore
be
thoroughly

one
of
the
first
considerations
in

is
the
ventilation
of
the
sick
room
care
must
be
taken
that

not
vitiated
by
anything
in
the
room
such
as
a
kerosene
lamp
wilted
cut
flowers
soiled
clothing
etc
the
bed
should
be
so
arranged
as
to
avoid
a
draft
especially
when
airing
the
room
if
the
room
is
too
small
to
allow
this
a
very
good
way
to
protect
the
patient
is
to
raise
an
umbrella
and
place
it
over
the
head
and
shoulders
over
this
put
a
blanket
while
the
room
is
being
aired
allowing
it
to
remain
until
the
room
has
reached
the
desired
temperature
again
never
turn
the
wick
of
a
lamp
below
the
point
of
free
combustion
in
the
room
of
either
sick
or
well
as
the
odor
is
not
only
disagreeable
but
injurious
one
of
the
most
important
essentials
in
a
sick
room
is
perfect
cleanliness
of
the
room
the
bed
linen
and
clothing
of
the
patient
never
air
or
dry
cloths
or
garments
in
the
sick
room
cover
the
broom
with
a
damp
flannel
cloth
in
sweeping
so
as
to
avoid
noise
and
prevent
the
dust
from
rising
avoid
noise
in
placing
coal
on
the
fire
by
putting
the
coal
in
a
paper
bag
placing
bag
and
all
upon
the
fire
do
not
allow
loud
talking
or
discussion
in
the
sick
room
neither
is
whispering
desirable
as
it
is
apt
to
irritate
the
patient
do
not
consult
the
patient
about
the
food
but
see
that
tempting
wholesome
varieties
are
provided
in
accordance
with
the
doctor
orders
concerning
the
diet
serve
food
in
small
quantities
and
either
hot
or
cold
as
the
article
may
require
a
warm
dish
which
should
be
hot
and
a
tepid
drink
or
food
which
should
be
cold
is
one
of
the
most
objectionable
and
unappetizing
forms
of
serving
food
do
not
allow
fresh
fruit
which
is
intended
for
the
patient
to
remain
in
the
sick
room
but
keep
in
a
cool
place
and
serve
when
needed
never
visit
a
sick
room
when
in
a
violent
perspiration
or
with
an
empty
stomach
as
the
system
at
that
time
is
more
susceptible
to
contagion
one
of
the
most
important
qualifications
in
a
nurse
is
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
nature
use
and
digestibility
as
well
as
the
best
methods
of
preparing
the
different
kinds
of
food
so
as
to
adapt
them
to
the
different
forms
of
disease
in
some
cases
when
the
system
has
been
overtaxed
either
mentally
or
physically
a
complete
rest
is
necessary
and
the
diet
should
be
food
which
merely
satisfies
the
hunger
neither
stimulating
nor
especially
nourishing
such
foods
come
under
the
head
of
gruels
soups
jellies
fruit
and
drinks
on
the
other
hand
when
a
patient
has
become
wasted
from
a
long
continued
illness
and
requires
building
up
more
nourishment
is
required
to
supply
the
waste
in
some
cases
the
food
must
be
given
in
concentrated
form
milk
is
one
of
the
most
valuable
foods
in
this
class
sometimes
it
requires
the
addition
of
a
little
pepsin
in
order
to
facilitate
digestion
sometimes
the
addition
of
a
pinch
of
salt
makes
milk
not
only
more
agreeable
to
the
patient
but
aids
digestion
eggs
either
lightly
boiled

easily
digested

shaken
together
and
in
some
cases
a

of
carefully
broiled
steak
or

are
suitable
foods
for
this
class
of

in
convalescence
any
well
cooked
easily
digested
food
may
be
given
fried

a
few
general
hints
for
school
children
too
much
attention
can
not
be
given
by
parents
to
the
diet
of
school
children
or
by
teachers
to
the
diet
of
pupils
under
their
care
in
boarding
schools
and
colleges
the
average
age
of
school
children
is
from
six
to
sixteen
years
during
this
time
both
mind
and
body
are
undergoing
development
throughout
school
period
the
growth
of
the
body
is
continued
until
almost
completed
there
are
unusual
demands
therefore
upon
the
functions
of
absorption
and
assimilation
the
food
must
be
abundant
and
of
the
character
to
furnish
new
tissue
and
to
yield
energy
in
the
form
of
heat
and
muscular
activity
the
food
should
also
contain
salts
of
lime
to
meet
the
requirements
of
formation
of
the
bones
and
teeth
many
children
acquire
habits
of
dislike
for
certain
articles
of
food
which
become
so
fixed
in
later
life
that
they
find
it
very
inconvenient
especially
when
placed
in
circumstances
as
in
travelling
where
one
can
not
always
obtain
the
accustomed
diet
it
therefore
is
unwise
to
cultivate
such
habits
which
are
often
a
serious
obstacle
to
normal
development
a
physician
is
often
baffled
in
the
treatment
of
a
severe
disease
by
the
vitiated
taste
of
the
patient
many
cases
of
anæmia
and
chlorosis
which
are
so
commonly
seen
in
young
girls
are
directly
traceable
to
a
faulty
diet
it
should
be
the
imperative
duty
of
all
teachers
to
consider
the
responsibility
of
rightly
developing
the
physical
constitutions
of
those
entrusted
to
their
care
they
should
remember
that
the
mind
keeps
on
developing
long
after
the
body
and
that
the
period
under
discussion
is
one
in
which
the
constitution
of
the
individual
is
established
for
the
remainder
of
life
at
this
stage
success
in
digestion
and
assimilation
is
of
greater
importance
than
success
in
mental
attainments
thompson
an
important
consideration
in
school
diet
is
to
avoid
monotony
which
becomes
so
common
from
economic
reasons
or
more
often
from
carelessness
it
is
so
much
easier
to
yield
to
routine
and
force
of
habit
than
to
study
the
question
the
hours
for
study
and
for
meals
should
be
so
regulated
that
sufficient
time
will
be
allowed
before
each
meal
for
children
to
wash
and
prepare
themselves
comfortably
without
going
to
the
table
excited
by
hurry
and
they
should
be
required
to
remain
at
the
table
for
a
fixed
time
and
not
allowed
to
hastily
swallow
their
food
in
order
to
complete
an
unfinished
task
or
game
an
interval
of
at
least
half
an
hour
should
intervene
after
meals
before
any
mental
exertion
is
required
constant
nibbling
at
food
between
meals
should
be
forbidden
it
destroys
the
appetite
increases
the
saliva
and
interferes
with
gastric
digestion
the
habit
of
chewing
gum
can
not
be
too
strongly
condemned
both
for
the
reason
given
in
the
preceding
sentence
and
for
its
effect
upon
the
muscles
and
nerves
it
is
being
more
and
more
realized
by
the
public
in
general
that
the
breaking
down
of
health
at
school
is
more
often
due
to
impoverished
nutrition
than
to
overwork
delicate
children
should
not
be
allowed
too
long
intervals
between
meals
as
for
instance
the
evening
meal
at
six
and
breakfast
the
following
morning
at
seven
or
half
past
a
glass
of
milk
and
a
piece
of
whole
wheat
bread
and
butter
should
be
given
if
they
awaken
during
the
night
delicate
children
whose
appetites
are
poor
and
who
do
not
do
proper
justice
to
their
regular
meals
should
be
given
an
extra
allowance
of
hot
broth
or
hot
milk
with
bread
and
butter
between
meals
these
rules
are
applicable
in
cases
of
children
who
during
one
or
two
years
seem
to
develop
with
extraordinary
rapidity
growing
sometimes
two
inches
or
more
in
six
months
the
demands
of
this
rapid
growth
must
be
met
by
proper
nutrition
or
serious
subsequent
impairment
of
vitality
may
result
such
children
should
have
their
meals
made
tempting
by
good
cooking
and
pleasant
variety
as
well
as
an
agreeable
appearance
of
the
food
meat
which
is
carved
in
unsightly
masses
and
vegetables
which
are
sodden
and

bread
as
a
rule
should

but
must
not
be

the
advantage
of
this

for
children
consists
in
its
containing
a

of
salts
which

they

are
very
apt
to
dislike
it
they
will
often
take

milk
should
be
freely
supplied
not
only
in
the
form
of
puddings
and
porridges
but
as
an
occasional
beverage
and
children
should
be
made
to
understand
that
when

they
can
obtain
a
glass
of
milk
or
a

of
crackers
or
bread
and

that
a

can
have

buttered

a
draft
of

meat
may
be
given
twice
a
day
but
not
oftener
it
may
sometimes
be
advisable
to
give
it
but
once
a
day
when
fish
or
eggs
are
supplied
it
should
however
be
given
at
least
once
daily
to
rapidly
growing
children
the
greater
number
of
children
have
a
natural
craving
for
sweets
the
energy
developed
in
active
childhood
necessitates
the
consumption
of
a
larger
proportion
of
sugar
than
is
required
by
adults
the
craving
of
children
for
confections
candy
furnishes
a
true
indication
of
the
actual
requirements
of
nature
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
a
certain
amount
of
wholesome
candy
not
only
does
most
children
no
harm
but
may
serve
them
as
an
excellent
food
the
main
difficulty
with
such
forms
of
sugar
however
is
that
children
are
not
furnished
with
a
proper
proportion
of
sugar
with
their
meals
and
the
meals
themselves
are
not
so
regulated
as
to
prevent
their
becoming
very
hungry
between
times
consequently
if
they
can
obtain
candy
which
satisfies
them
for
the
time
they
are
very
apt
to
eat
too
much
with
the
result
of
producing
more
or
less
dyspepsia
and
diminishing
the
normal
appetite
alcohol
in
every
form
should
be
absolutely
excluded
if
given
during
early
youth
it
is
particularly
prone
to
develop
a
taste
which
may
become
uncontrollable
in
later
years
children
should
not
indulge
in
tea
and
coffee
as
a
general
rule
active
muscular
exercise
in
children
disturbs
their
digestive
process
far
less
than
mental
effort
when
taken
immediately
after
meals
and
every
adult
is
familiar
with
the
romping
which
children
can
undertake
straightway
after
dinner
often
though
not
always
with
impunity
whereas
a
proportionate
amount
of
exercise
on
the
part
of
an
adult
might
produce
a
severe
dyspeptic
attack

infants

one
of
the
most
important
subjects
included
in
a
domestic
science
course
of
study
is
the
feeding
and
care
of
infants
a
subject
requiring
special
intelligence
and
consideration
one
which
embodies
the
condensed
information
of
the
preceding
chapters
and
is
the
foundation
upon
which
the
future
physical
structure
is
built
it
is
not
upon
the
mother
alone
that
the
baby
depends
for
care
and
attention
many
young
girls
especially
elder
sisters
and
have
this
responsibility
placed
upon
them
when
they
are
little
more
than
children
themselves
to
these
as
well
as
to
young
mothers
the
following
suggestions
may
prove
helpful
the
first
demand
of
an
infant
is
for
food
and
upon
the
quality
and
quantity
of
the
article
provided
depends
the
health
of
the
child
as
well
as
the
comfort
of
the
household
milk
is
the
only
food
required
by
an
infant
until
it
is
at
least
seven
or
eight
months
old
or
until
sufficient
saliva
is
secreted
to
assist
digestion
some
authorities
say
one
year
others
until
the
child
has
sufficient
teeth
with
which
to
masticate
food
if
supply
is
not
available
or
sufficient
the
best
substitute
is
milk
as
cow
milk
contains
less
sugar
of
milk
and
fat
cream
than
human
milk
these
must
be
supplied
being
more
acid
than
alkaline
this
must
be
corrected
by
the
use
of
lime
water
there
is
more
casein
curd
in
cow
milk
than
in
mother
milk
therefore
water
must
be
added
to
reduce
this

after
the

is
a

the
quantity
may
be
increased
to

at

the

the

the
best
household
remedies
for
burns
are
baking

mix
the
soda
to
a
paste
with
water
and
spread
thickly
over

cotton
this
may
be
kept
wet
by
squeezing
water
over
it
if

they
should
be
soaked
with

hints

place
and
not
in

jumble
see
that
the
tablecloth
is
spread
smoothly
that
the
corners

place
the

at
the
corners
of

salts
are

they

placed
at
the
head
of
the
plates
where
the
dessert
spoon
may
be
placed
the
handle
towards
the
right
for
convenience
the
general
rule
in
serving
simple
family
meals
with
or
without
a
waitress
is
for
the
hostess
to
serve
the
porridge
and
coffee
at
breakfast
the
soup
salad
and
dessert
at
dinner
and
pour
the
tea
at
the
evening
meal
when
luncheon
is
served
in
the
middle
of
the
day
the
hostess
usually
does
the
greater
part
of
the
serving
as
luncheon
is
considered
to
be
the
most
informal
meal
of
the
day
a
few
hints
for
waitresses
learn
to
move
quickly
and
quietly
be
scrupulously
clean
and
neat
in
every
detail
of
dress
and
habit
before
serving
a
meal
see
that
hands
and
finger
nails
are
clean
always
have
a
fresh
white
apron
ready
to
put
on
before
the
meal
is
announced
look
over
the
table
and
see
that
everything
is
in
its
place
before
announcing
a
meal
fill
the
glasses
with
water
either
before
the
family
enter
the
dining
room
or
immediately
after
they
are
seated
lift
the
covers
from
hot
dishes
and
turn
them
over
at
once
in
order
to
prevent
the
steam
from
dropping
on
the
cloth
take
the
plate
from
the
host
or
hostess
and
place
before
each
person
from
the
right
side
keep
the
thumb
well
under
the
plate
when
passing
anything
from
which
the
persons
seated
at
table
help
themselves
such
as
vegetables
sauces
always
go
to
the
left
so
as
to
leave
the
right
hand
of
the
one
to
be
served
free
keep
a
watchful
eye
over
the
table
and
pass
anything
apparently
required
learn
to
receive
instructions
from
the
hostess
in
an
undertone
do
not
get
excited
and
try
to
do
too
many
things
at
once
it
is
an
accomplishment
to
be
a
good
waitress
as
it
requires
special
refinement
and
deftness
which
are
scarcely
compatible
with
an
untidy
nature
when
serving
meals
without
a
waitress
the
daughters
of
the
house
should
consider
it
their
special
privilege
to
save
the
mother
any
annoyance
or
discomfort
during
the
meal
time
never
allow
dishes
which
have
been
used
to
accumulate
on
the
table
or
allow
the
table
to
become
disordered
as
much
of
the
food
as
possible
should
be
placed
on
the
table
before
the
family
are
seated
and
the
plates
or
dishes
removed
at
once
after
using
no
matter
how
simple
the
meal
may
be
every
housekeeper
should
see
that
it
is
served
neatly
and
on
time
teachers
may
exercise
a
influence
in
the
refining
of
home
life
by
impressing
upon
the
pupils
the
importance
of
these
too
often
considered
minor
matters
and
by
giving
minute
instructions
in
the
setting
of
table
and
serving
the
meal
one
carefully
planned
lesson
will
convey
more
knowledge
of
such
matters
than
any
number
of
lectures
or
pages
of
theory
consideration
of
menus
the
following
menus
and
analyses
are
taken
from
bulletin
no
prepared
in
the
united
states
experiment
stations
and
are
inserted
so
as
to
give
some
idea
of
the
cost
and
relative
value
of
various
foods
in
combination
must
be
remembered
that
the
prices
given
are
in
excess
of
prices
in
ontario
therefore
the
cost
per
menu
would
be
less
than
is
given
in
these
the
more
expensive
menus
have
been
omitted
the
writer
of
the
article
says
in
planning
a
well
balanced
diet
the
following
points
must
be
considered
the
use
of
any
considerable
amount
of
fat
meat
or
starchy
food
should
be
offset
by
the
use
of
some
material
rich
in
protein
thus
if
roast
pork
is
to
be
eaten
for
dinner
veal
fish
or
lean
beef
might
well
be
eaten
for
breakfast
or
supper
or
both
bean
soup
furnishes
a
considerable
amount
of
protein
while
bouillon
consommé
and
tomato
soup
are
practically
useless
as
a
source
of
nutriment
skim
milk
also
furnishes
protein
with
but
very
little
accompanying
fats
and
carbohydrates
to
increase
the
fuel
value
the
use
of
lean
meats
or
fish
for
all
three
meals
would
require
the
use
of
such
foods
as
rice
tapioca
or
cornstarch
pudding
considerable
quantities
of
sugar
and
butter
and
more
vegetables
in
order
to
furnish
sufficient
fuel
value
since
flour
sugar
and
butter
or
lard
enter
very
largely
into
pastries
and
desserts
the
larger
the
quantities
of
these
dishes
that
are
consumed
the
larger
does
the
fuel
value
tend
to
become
as
compared
with
the
protein
the
principal
classes
of
food
materials
may
be
roughly
grouped
as
follows
as
regards
the
proportion
of
protein
to
fuel
value
beginning
with
those
which
have
the
largest
proportion
of
protein
and
ending
with
those
which
contain
little
or
no
protein
foods
containing
a
large
amount
of
protein
as
compared
with
the
fuel
value
fish
veal
lean
beef
such
as
shank
shoulder
canned
corned
round
neck
and
chuck
skim
milk
foods
containing
a
medium
amount
of
protein
fowl
eggs
mutton
leg
and
shoulder
beef
fatter
cuts
such
as
rib
loin
rump
flank
and
brisket
whole
milk
beans
and
peas
mutton
chuck
and
loin
cheese
lean
pork
oatmeal
and
other
breakfast
foods
flour
bread
etc
foods
containing
little
or
no
protein
vegetables
and
fruit
fat
pork
rice
tapioca
starch
butter
and
other
fats
and
oils
sugar
syrups
the
menus
to
illustrate
the
ways
in
which
milk
may
be
combined
with
other
food
materials
to
form
daily
dietaries
with
about
the
amount
of
protein
and
the
fuel
value
called
for
by
the
standard
for
men
at
moderate
muscular
work
a
few
menus
are
given
in
the
following
pages
these
menus
are
intended
to
show
how
approximately
the
same
nutritive
value
may
be
obtained
by
food
combinations
differing
widely
as
regards
the
number
kind
and
price
of
the
food
materials
used
to
make
up
three
daily
meals
they
also
illustrate
how
the
cost
of
the
daily
menu
may
vary
greatly
with
the
kind
and
variety
of
materials
purchased
though
the
nutritive
value
remains
the
same
these
sample
menus
should
not
however
be
regarded
as
in
any
sense
models
to
be
followed
in
actual
practice
the
daily
menus
for
any
family
will
necessarily
vary
with
the
market
supply
the
season
and
the
relative
expensiveness
of
different
food
materials
as
well
as
with
the
tastes
and
purse
of
the
consumers
the
point
to
which
we
wish
here
to
draw
especial
attention
is
that
the
prudent
buyer
of
foods
for
family
consumption
can
not
afford
to
wholly
neglect
their
nutritive
value
in
making
such
purchases
with
reference
to
the
following
daily
menus
several
points
must
be
definitely
borne
in
mind
the
amounts
given
represent
about
what
would
be
called
for
in
a
family
equivalent
to
four
men
at
ordinary
manual
labor
such
as
machinists
carpenters
farmers
truckmen
according
to
the
usually
accepted
standards
sedentary
people
would
require
somewhat
less
than
the
amounts
here
given
children
as
a
rule
may
be
considered
as
having
moderate
muscular
exercise
and
it
may
easily
be
understood
that
the
boy
eats
as
much
as
his
father
who
is
engaged
in
business
or
professional
occupation
both
requiring
according
to
the
tentative
standard
of
the
food
needed
by
a
man
with
moderate
muscular
work
it
is
not
assumed
that
any
housewife
will
find
it
convenient
to
follow
exactly
the
proportions
suggested
in
the
menus
the
purpose
is
to
show
her
about
what
amounts
and
proportions
of
food
materials
would
give
the
required
nutrients
a
family
equivalent
to
four
men
having
little
muscular
exercise
men
with
sedentary
occupation
would
require
but
about
the
quantities
indicated
in
the
following
menus
it
would
be
very
doubtful
however
if
they
would
eat
proportionally
less
of
every
food

the

either
by

it
to

roughly

quart

be
substituted
for
half
a

the
amount

vi

following
are

how
nourishing
food
can
be
procured
in
sufficient
quantities
and
moderate
variety
at
a
cost
of
not
over
cents
per
day
the
cost
to
the
farmer
would
be
much
less
since
these
menus
call
for
considerable
amounts
of
milk
which
is
hardly
worth
more
than
or
as
much
on
the
farm
as
it
costs
in
the
towns
and
cities
coffee
has
not
always
been
indicated
but
can
be
introduced
for
any
meal
at
a
cost
of
from
to
cents
per
cup
according
to
how
much
coffee
is
used
in
making
the
infusion
and
how
much
sugar
milk
and
cream
are
added
it
is
of
course
not
important
that
each
meal
or
the
total
food
of
each
individual
day
should
have
just
the
right
amount
of
nutrients
or
that
the
proportions
of
protein
and
fuel
ingredients
should
be
exactly
correct
so
as
to
make
the
meal
or
day
diet
well
balanced
the
body
is
continually
storing
nutritive
materials
and
using
them
it
is
not
dependent
any
day
upon
the
food
eaten
that
particular
day
hence
an
excess
one
day
may
be
made
up
by
a
deficiency
the

nourishment
requires
simply
that

discussion
of
the
menus
these
menus
attempt
to
give
as
nearly
as
convenient
the
range
of
food
materials
and
the
variety
of
combination
which
might
be
found
in
the
average
household
some
of
the
menus
are
more
varied
and
costly
than
others
and
a
few
are
given
showing
the
effect
of
the
use
of
more
milk
and
also
how
a
diet
might
easily
become
the
quantities
of
the
different
foods
used
per
meal
will
not
it
is
believed
be
found
out
of
proportion
to
each
other
though
of
course
they
will
not
suit
every
family
the
weights
of
all
materials
oatmeal
and
other
cereals
meat
vegetables
are
for
these
substances
as
purchased
the
calculation
of
the
quantities
of
nutrients
contained
in
the
different
foods
is
based
upon
the
average
percentage
composition
of
these
materials
inasmuch
as
the
fats
and
carbohydrates
are
used
simply
as
fuel
they
are
not
shown
in
the
menus
only
the
quantity
of
protein
and
the
fuel
value
of
the
food
being
of
interest
the
cost
of
the
different
food
materials
must
of
necessity
be
more
or
less
of
a
varying
quantity
depending
upon
the
season
of
the
year
the
character
of
the
markets
large
or
small
city
or
country
etc
of
the
more
important
food
materials
the
assumed
price
per

is

it
is
probable
that
the
above
figures
represent
more
nearly
the
average
prices
of
the
different
food
materials
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
country
than
in
the
central
and
western
portions
where
meats
cereals
and
many
other
products
are
somewhat
cheaper
it
is
also
to
be
borne
in
mind
that
by
observing
the
markets
many
food
materials
can
be
purchased
much
cheaper
than
here
indicated
while
on
the
other
hand
there
may
be
times
when
they
will
be
much
more
expensive
the
choice
of
vegetables
and
fruits
will
naturally
be
governed
by
their
abundance
and
cost
another
point
that
must
not
be
overlooked
is
that
the
quantities
and
consequently
the
costs
here
given
are
for
four
working
men
that
is
to
say
men
engaged
in
moderately
hard
muscular
labor
of
course
different
individuals
differ
greatly
in
their
needs
for
food
these
figures
express
only
general
averages
and
are
based
upon
the
best
information
accessible
a
few
points
to
be
considered
in
planning
meals
dietetic
authorities
advise
people
who
are
engaged
in
active
muscular
work
to
partake
of
the
more
substantial
meal
in
the
middle
of
the
day
leaving
such
articles
of
food
as
soup
which
is
a
valuable
stimulant
after
a
day
of
hard
work
fruit
cake
for
the
evening
meal
when
the
system
is
too
much
exhausted
to
digest
the
more
concentrated
foods
when
men
are
obliged
to
take
cold
lunches
in
the
middle
of
the
day
the
housewife
should
see
that
the
lunch
basket
contains
the
necessary
nourishment
in
the
form
of
cheese
cold
meat
meat
or
fish
sandwiches
hard
boiled
eggs
a
fish
or
vegetable
salad
cold
pork
and
beans
rice
pudding
whole
wheat
bread
and
butter
a
bottle
of
milk
or
tea
or
coffee
pie
doughnuts
etc
remember
a
man
working
in
the
open
air
or
in
a
large
building
requires
food
which
will
not
oxidize
too
quickly
or
in
other
words
food
which
will
keep
up
the
fuel
and
force
necessary
for
his
work
supper
in
such
cases
should
consist
of
a
good
broth
or
well
made
soup
and
the
lighter
foods
but
breakfast
and
dinner
should
be
more
substantial
it
is
a
question
of
economy
to
provide
suitable
food
for
the
the
children
may
be
equally
well
nourished
on
a
less
expensive
diet
such
as
whole
wheat
bread
and
butter
milk
puddings
fruit
green
vegetables
cereals
milk
and
meat
once
a
day
on
the
other
hand
the
individual
engaged
in
sedentary
employment
such
as
teaching
needlework
should
dine
later
in
the
day
as
it
leaves
a
longer
interval
for
digestion
which
is
much
slower
when
the
individual
is
confined
in
a
close
office
or
and
where
little
exercise
is
taken
care
should
be
taken
in
planning
meals
for
this
class
to
avoid
food
which
requires
much
oxygen
such
as
fresh
pork
fried
food
sausage
warm
bread
pastry
griddle
cakes
etc
the
meal
of
a
brain
worker
or
business
man
should
be
light
a
soup
glass
of
milk
hot
or
cold
fruit
bread
and
butter
vegetable
salad
a
broiled
chop
or
steak
are
suitable
for
luncheon
special
attention
should
be
given
to
the
diet
of
school
children
see
p
students
and
children
who
are
obliged
to
study
at
night
should
as
a
rule
take
some
light
nourishment
before
retiring
a
biscuit
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
or
a
glass
of
hot
milk
is
sufficient
young
girls
who
are
employed
in
shops
factories
frequently
hurry
away
to
their
work
in
the
morning
without
taking
a
substantial
breakfast
it
is
needless
to
say
that
such
action
is
sure
to
be
followed
by
a
physical
breakdown
a
glass
of
hot
milk
or
an
egg
beaten
and
added
to
a
glass
of
milk
will
serve
as
an
occasional
substitute
for
a
more
substantial
meal
but
is
not
enough
to
sustain
active
exercise
for
any
length
of
time
another
point
to
consider
in
the
planning
of
meals
is
economy
of
fuel
the
thoughtful
housekeeper
will
arrange
to
have
food
requiring
long
slow
cooking
such
as
stews
soup
stock
bread
and
ironing
done
by
the
same
fuel
broiling
toasting
omelets
require
a
quick
fire
it
is
in
the
careful
consideration
of
details
that
economy
in
both
food
and
fuel
may
be
exercised
footnote
the
teacher
may
make
this
clear
by
comparing
the
digestion
of
the
two
classes
to
the
action
of
the
air
upon
coal
in
a
range
with
the
drafts
open
and
closed
the
more
rapid
combustion
effect
of
oxygen
etc
suggestive
questions
in
giving
instruction
in
domestic
science
the
teacher
must
be
careful
to
explain
the
meaning
of
any
words
used
which
the
pupils
would
not
be
likely
to
understand
for
instance
oxidation
combustion
solubility
and
many
of
the
terms
used
in
the
analysis
such
as
fermentation
casein
of
milk
albumen
cellulose
etc
in
order
to
keep
the
attention
of
pupils
fixed
on
a
subject
frequent
illustrations
and
comparisons
should
be
made
questioning
is
one
of
the
best
methods
of
riveting
attention
and
as
every
teacher
has
not
the
faculty
of
asking
questions
a
few
suggestive
ones
are
given
which
may
prove
helpful

the
following
outline
is
offered
as
a
tentative
plan
of
work
for
an
average
class
of
girls
in
the
highest
grades
of
the
public
school
the
exact
order
of
lessons
depends
in
a
measure
on
the
skill
and
interest
of
the
pupils
and
the
special
dishes
selected
to
illustrate
a
principle
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
pupils
and
upon
the
season
of
the
year
it
should
be
noted
that
beginning
with
the
third
lesson
there
are
four
lessons
on
the
cooking
of
carbohydrates
then
four
on
the
cooking
of
nitrogenous
foods
next
the
batters
combining
the
two
and
introducing
the
use
of
fat
and
so
on
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
arrangement
to
enforce
the
effects
produced
by
heat
on
the
food
principles
singly
and
in
combination
to
alternate
the
groups
so
that
there
is
a
constant
review
of
principles
already
established
and
to
give
practical
work
of
increasing
difficulty
the
course
in
cooking
should
be
preceded
by
a
few
lessons
in
and
at
least
one
on
the
care
of
the
kitchen
it
is
taken
for
granted
that
the
lessons
are
accompanied
by
a
study
of
food
values
the
cost
of
food
marketing
etc
simple
experiments
in
combustion
to
illustrate
the
structure
of
stoves
and
the
care
of
such
stoves
study
of
the
fuel
and
apparatus
to
be
used
in
the
school
kitchen
practice
in
using
the
apparatus
comparison
with
other
apparatus
utensils
what
they
are
of
what
materials
and
why
it
is
well
to
have
pupils
make
a
list
in
of
simple
kitchen
furnishing
experiments
with
the
boiling
of
water
in
florence
flask
in
and
in
covered
saucepan
using
thermometer
use
of
double
boiler
compare
with
boiling
water
the
temperature
of
fat
hot
enough
for
frying
and
also
that
of
the
oven
to
illustrate
the
two
latter
croutons
may
be
made
measuring
experiment
with
the
cooking
of
starch
in
water
cornstarch
pudding
or
tapioca
or
sago
jelly
develop
the
idea
of
the
effect
of
the
boiling
temperature
on
the
starch
grains
the
bursting
of
the
grains
and
the
change
in
flavor
due
to
continued
cooking
a
cereal
and
a
fruit
say
baked
apples
in
the
cereal
in
addition
to
the
starch
is
the
cooking
of
the
woody
fibre
note
in
both
cereal
and
fruit
the
flavors
developed
by
heat
the
cooking
being
a
continuation
as
it
were
of
the
ripening
process
a
starchy
and
a
green
vegetable
as
for
instance
potatoes
and
cabbage
here
again
are
the
two
principles
cookery
of
starch
and
vegetable
fibre
again
the
development
of
flavor
by
heat
cookery
of
peas
and
beans
would
better
be
deferred
until
the
pupils
are
familiar
with
the
effect
of
water
on
nitrogenous
substances
if
time
allows
a
sauce
may
be
made
to
serve
with
a
vegetable
or
this
may
be
given
in
the
next
lesson
vegetable
soups
without
meat
stock
this
is
in
part
a
review
lesson
opportunity
is
offered
here
for
the
study
of
proportions
several
ingredients
being
used
how
much
vegetable
pulp
or
juice
to
how
much
liquid
how
much

and
how
much

and
possibly
a
plain
omelet

has
been
found
practical
in
a
short
course
where
it
was
advisable
to
give
the
pupils
work
