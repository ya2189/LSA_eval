woman
and

race

preface
the
modern
woman
movement
like
the
modern
labour
movement
may
be
said
to
have
begun
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
labour
movement
arose
out
of
the
industrial
revolution
with
its
resultant
tendency
to
to
unrestricted
competition
to
social
misery
and
disorder
the
woman
movement
appeared
as
an
at
first
neglected
of
the
french
revolution
with
its
impulses
of
general
human
expansion
of
freedom
and
of
equality
since
then
as
we
know
these
two
movements
have
each
had
a
great
and
vigorous
career
which
is
still
far
from
completed
on
the
whole
they
have
moved
independently
along
separate
lines
and
have
at
times
seemed
indeed
almost
hostile
to
each
other
that
has
ceased
to
be
the
case
of
recent
years
it
has
been
seen
not
only
that
these
two
movements
are
not
hostile
but
that
they
may
work
together
harmoniously
for
similar
ends
one
final
step
remained
to
be
taken
it
had
to
be
realised
not
only
that
the
labour
movement
could
give
the
secret
of
success
to
the
woman
movement
by
its
method
and
organization
but
that
on
the
other
hand
woman
held
the
secret
without
which
labour
is
impotent
to
reach
its
ends
woman
by
virtue
of
motherhood
is
the
regulator
of
the
birthrate
the
sacred
disposer
of
human
production
it
is
in
the
deliberate
restraint
and
measurement
of
human
production
that
the
fundamental
problems
of
the
family
the
nation
the
whole
brotherhood
of
mankind
find
their
solution
the
health
and
longevity
of
the
individual
the
economic
welfare
of
the
workers
the
general
level
of
culture
of
the
community
the
possibility
of
abolishing
from
the
world
the
desolating
scourge
of
war
all
these
like
great
human
needs
depend
primarily
and
fundamentally
on
the
wise
limitation
of
the
human
output
it
does
not
certainly
make
them
inevitable
but
it
renders
them
possible
of
accomplishment
without
it
they
have
been
clearly
and
repeatedly
proved
to
be
impossible
these
facts
have
long
been
known
to
the
few
who
view
the
world
realistically
but
it
is
not
the
few
who
rule
the
world
it
is
the
masses
the
ignorant
emotional
volatile
superstitious
masses
who
rule
the
world
it
is
they
who
choose
the
few
supreme
persons
who
manage
or
mismanage
the
world
affairs
even
the
most
stupid
of
us
must
be
able
to
see
how
it
is
done
now
for
during
recent
years
the
whole
process
has
been
displayed
before
us
on
the
very
largest
scale
the
lesson
has
not
been
altogether
in
vain
it
is
furnishing
a
new
stimulus
to
those
who
are
working
for
the
increase
of
knowledge
and
of
practical
action
based
on
knowledge
among
the
masses
the
masses
who
alone
possess
the
power
to
change
the
force
of
the
world
for
good
or
for
evil
and
by
growth
in
wisdom
to
raise
the
human
race
on
to
a
higher
level
that
is
why
the
little
book
by
margaret
sanger
whose
right
to
speak
with
authority
on
these
matters
we
all
recognize
can
not
be
too
widely
read
to
the
few
who
think
though
they
may
here
and
there
differ
on
points
of
detail
it
is
all
as
familiar
as
a
but
to
the
millions
who
rule
the
world
it
is
not
familiar
and
still
less
to
the
handful
of
superior
persons
whom
the
masses
elect
to
supreme
positions
therefore
let
this
book
be
read
let
it
be
read
by
every
man
and
woman
who
can
read
and
the
sooner
it
is
not
only
read
but
acted
on
the
better
for
the
world

chapter
i
woman
error
and
her
debt
the
most
social
development
of
modern
times
is
the
revolt
of
woman
against
sex
servitude
the
most
important
force
in
the
remaking
of
the
world
is
a
free
motherhood
beside
this
force
the
elaborate
international
programmes
of
modern
statesmen
are
weak
and
superficial
diplomats
may
formulate
leagues
of
nations
and
nations
may
pledge
their
utmost
strength
to
maintain
them
statesmen
may
dream
of
reconstructing
the
world
out
of
alliances
hegemonies
and
spheres
of
influence
but
woman
continuing
to
produce
explosive
populations
will
convert
these
pledges
into
the
proverbial
scraps
of
paper
or
she
may
by
controlling
birth
lift
motherhood
to
the
plane
of
a
voluntary
intelligent
function
and
remake
the
world
when
the
world
is
thus
remade
it
will
exceed
the
dream
of
statesman
reformer
and
revolutionist
only
in
recent
years
has
woman
position
as
the
gentler
and
weaker
half
of
the
human
family
been
emphatically
and
generally
questioned
men
assumed
that
this
was
woman
place
woman
herself
accepted
it
it
seldom
occurred
to
anyone
to
ask
whether
she
would
go
on
occupying
it
forever
upon
the
mere
surface
of
woman
organized
protests
there
were
no
indications
that
she
was
desirous
of
achieving
a
fundamental
change
in
her
position
she
claimed
the
right
of
suffrage
and
legislative
regulation
of
her
working
hours
and
asked
that
her
property
rights
be
equal
to
those
of
the
man
none
of
these
demands
however
affected
directly
the
most
vital
factors
of
her
existence
whether
she
won
her
point
or
failed
to
win
it
she
remained
a
dominated
weakling
in
a
society
controlled
by
men
woman
acceptance
of
her
inferior
status
was
the
more
real
because
it
was
unconscious
she
had
chained
herself
to
her
place
in
society
and
the
family
through
the
maternal
functions
of
her
nature
and
only
chains
thus
strong
could
have
bound
her
to
her
lot
as
a
brood
animal
for
the
masculine
civilizations
of
the
world
in
accepting
her
r√¥le
as
the
weaker
and
gentler
half
she
accepted
that
function
in
turn
the
acceptance
of
that
function
fixed
the
more
firmly
her
rank
as
an
inferior
caught
in
this
vicious
circle
woman
has
through
her
reproductive
ability
founded
and
perpetuated
the
tyrannies
of
the
earth
whether
it
was
the
tyranny
of
a
monarchy
an
oligarchy
or
a
republic
the
one
indispensable
factor
of
its
existence
was
as
it
is
now
hordes
of
human
beings
human
beings
so
plentiful
as
to
be
cheap
and
so
cheap
that
ignorance
was
their
natural
lot
upon
the
rock
of
an
unenlightened
submissive
maternity
have
these
been
founded
upon
the
product
of
such
a
maternity
have
they
flourished
no
despot
ever
flung
forth
his
legions
to
die
in
foreign
conquest
no
nation
ever
erupted
across
its
borders
to
lock
in
death
embrace
with
another
but
behind
them
loomed
the
driving
power
of
a
population
too
large
for
its
boundaries
and
its
natural
resources
no
period
of
low
wages
or
of
idleness
with
their
want
among
the
workers
no
peonage
or
sweatshop
no
factory
ever
came
into
being
save
from
the
same
source
nor
have
famine
and
plague
been
as
much
acts
of
god
as
acts
of
too
prolific
mothers
they
also
as
all
students
know
have
their
basic
causes
in
the
creators
of
are
the
women
who
while
wringing
their
hands
over
each
fresh
horror
submit
anew
to
their
task
of
producing
the
multitudes
who
will
bring
about
the
tragedy
of
civilization
while
unknowingly
laying
the
foundations
of
tyrannies
and
providing
the
human
tinder
for
racial
conflagrations
woman
was
also
unknowingly
creating
slums
filling
asylums
with
insane
and
institutions
with
other
defectives
she
was
replenishing
the
ranks
of
the
prostitutes
furnishing
grist
for
the
criminal
courts
and
inmates
for
prisons
had
she
planned
deliberately
to
achieve
this
tragic
total
of
human
waste
and
misery
she
could
hardly
have
done
it
more
effectively
woman
passivity
under
the
burden
of
her
disastrous
task
was
almost
altogether
that
of
ignorant
resignation
she
knew
virtually
nothing
about
her
reproductive
nature
and
less
about
the
consequences
of
her
excessive
it
is
true
that
obeying
the
inner
urge
of
their
natures
women
revolted
they
went
even
to
the
extreme
of
infanticide
and
abortion
usually
their
revolts
were
not
general
enough
they
fought
as
individuals
not
as
a
mass
in
the
mass
they
sank
back
into
blind
and
hopeless
subjection
they
went
on
breeding
with
staggering
rapidity
those
numberless
undesired
children
who
become
the
clogs
and
the
destroyers
of
civilizations
however
woman
is
rising
in
fundamental
revolt
even
her
efforts
at
mere
reform
are
as
we
shall
see
later
steps
in
that
direction
underneath
each
of
them
is
the
feminine
urge
to
complete
freedom
millions
of
women
are
asserting
their
right
to
voluntary
motherhood
they
are
determined
to
decide
for
themselves
whether
they
shall
become
mothers
under
what
conditions
and
when
this
is
the
fundamental
revolt
referred
to
it
is
for
woman
the
key
to
the
temple
of
liberty
even
as
birth
control
is
the
means
by
which
woman
attains
basic
freedom
so
it
is
the
means
by
which
she
must
and
will
uproot
the
evil
she
has
wrought
through
her
submission
as
she
has
unconsciously
and
ignorantly
brought
about
social
disaster
so
must
and
will
she
consciously
and
intelligently
that
disaster
and
create
a
new
and
a
better
order
the
task
is
hers
it
can
not
be
avoided
by
excuses
nor
can
it
be
delegated
it
is
not
enough
for
woman
to
point
to
the
domination
of
man
nor
does
it
avail
to
plead
the
guilt
of
rulers
and
the
exploiters
of
labor
it
makes
no
difference
that
she
does
not
formulate
industrial
systems
nor
that
she
is
an
instinctive
believer
in
social
justice
in
her
submission
lies
her
error
and
her
guilt
by
her
failure
to
withhold
the
multitudes
of
children
who
have
made
inevitable
the
most
flagrant
of
our
social
evils
she
incurred
a
debt
to
society
regardless
of
her
own
wrongs
regardless
of
her
lack
of
opportunity
and
regardless
of
all
other
considerations
must
pay
that
debt
she
must
not
think
to
pay
this
debt
in
any
superficial
way
she
can
not
pay
it
with
palliatives
with
laws
prohibition
regulation
of
prostitution
and
agitation
against
war
political
nostrums
and
social
panaceas
are
but
incidentally
and
superficially
useful
they
do
not
touch
the
source
of
the
social
disease
war
famine
poverty
and
oppression
of
the
workers
will
continue
while
woman
makes
life
cheap
they
will
cease
only
when
she
limits
her
reproductivity
and
human
life
is
no
longer
a
thing
to
be
wasted
two
chief
obstacles
hinder
the
discharge
of
this
tremendous
obligation
the
first
and
the
lesser
is
the
legal
barrier
laws
would
still
deny
to
her
the
knowledge
of
her
reproductive
nature
such
knowledge
is
indispensable
to
intelligent
motherhood
and
she
must
achieve
it
despite
absurd
statutes
and
equally
absurd
moral
canons
the
second
and
more
serious
barrier
is
her
own
ignorance
of
the
extent
and
effect
of
her
submission
until
she
knows
the
evil
her
subjection
has
wrought
to
herself
to
her
progeny
and
to
the
world
at
large
she
can
not
wipe
out
that
evil
to
get
rid
of
these
obstacles
is
to
invite
attack
from
the
forces
of
reaction
which
are
so
strongly
entrenched
in
our
society
it
means
warfare
in
every
phase
of
her
life
nevertheless
at
whatever
cost
she
must
emerge
from
her
ignorance
and
assume
her
responsibility
she
can
do
this
only
when
she
has
awakened
to
a
knowledge
of
herself
and
of
the
consequences
of
her
ignorance
the
first
step
is
birth
control
through
birth
control
she
will
attain
to
voluntary
motherhood
having
attained
this
the
basic
freedom
of
her
sex
she
will
cease
to
enslave
herself
and
the
mass
of
humanity
then
through
the
understanding
of
the
intuitive
forward
urge
within
her
she
will
not
stop
at
patching
up
the
world
she
will
remake
it
chapter
ii
woman
struggle
for
freedom
behind
all
customs
of
whatever
nature
behind
all
social
unrest
behind
all
movements
behind
all
revolutions
are
great
driving
forces
which
in
their
action
and
reaction
upon
conditions
give
character
to
civilization
if
in
seeking
to
discover
the
source
of
a
custom
of
a
movement
or
of
a
revolution
we
stop
at
surface
conditions
we
shall
never
discern
more
than
a
superficial
aspect
of
the
underlying
truth
this
is
the
error
into
which
the
historian
has
almost
universally
fallen
it
is
also
a
common
error
among
sociologists
it
is
the
fashion
nowadays
for
instance
to
explain
all
social
unrest
in
terms
of
economic
conditions
this
is
a
valuable
working
theory
and
has
done
much
to
awaken
men
to
their
injustice
toward
one
another
but
it
ignores
the
forces
within
humanity
which
drive
it
to
revolt
it
is
these
forces
rather
than
the
conditions
upon
which
they
react
that
are
the
important
factors
conditions
change
but
the
animating
force
goes
on
forever
so
too
with
woman
struggle
for
emancipation
women
in
all
lands
and
all
ages
have
instinctively
desired
family
limitation
usually
this
desire
has
been
laid
to
economic
pressure
frequently
the
pressure
has
existed
but
the
driving
force
behind
woman
aspiration
has
lain
deeper
it
has
asserted
itself
among
the
rich
and
among
the
poor
among
the
intelligent
and
the
unintelligent
it
has
been
manifested
in
such
horrors
as
infanticide
child
abandonment
and
abortion
the
only
term
sufficiently
comprehensive
to
define
this
motive
power
of
woman
nature
is
the
that
spirit
manifests
itself
most
frequently
in
motherhood
but
it
is
greater
than
maternity
woman
herself
all
that
she
is
all
that
she
has
ever
been
all
that
she
may
be
is
but
the
outworking
of
this
inner
spiritual
urge
given
free
play
this
supreme
law
of
her
nature
asserts
itself
in
beneficent
ways
interfered
with
it
becomes
destructive
only
when
we
understand
this
can
we
comprehend
the
efforts
of
the
feminine
spirit
to
liberate
itself
when
the
outworking
of
this
force
within
her
is
hampered
by
the
bearing
and
the
care
of
too
many
children
woman
rebels
hence
it
is
that
from
time
immemorial
she
has
sought
some
form
of
family
limitation
when
she
has
not
employed
such
measures
consciously
she
has
done
so
instinctively
where
laws
customs
and
religious
restrictions
do
not
prevent
she
has
recourse
to
contraceptives
otherwise
she
resorts
to
child
abandonment
abortion
and
infanticide
or
resigns
herself
hopelessly
to
enforced
maternity
these
violent
means
of
freeing
herself
from
the
chains
of
her
own
reproductivity
have
been
most
in
evidence
where
economic
conditions
have
made
the
care
of
children
even
more
of
a
burden
than
it
would
otherwise
have
been
but
whether
in
the
luxurious
home
of
the
athenian
the
dwelling
of
the
chinese
or
the
crude
hut
of
the
primitive
australian
savage
the
woman
whose
development
has
been
interfered
with
by
the
bearing
and
rearing
of
children
has
tried
desperately
frantically
too
often
in
vain
to
take
and
hold
her
freedom
individual
men
have
sometimes
acquiesced
in
these
violent
measures
but
in
the
mass
they
have
opposed
by
law
by
religious
canons
by
public
opinion
by
penalties
ranging
all
the
way
from
ostracism
to
beheading
they
have
sought
to
crush
this
effort
neither
threat
of
hell
nor
the
infliction
of
physical
punishment
has
availed
women
have
deceived
and
dared
resisted
and
defied
the
power
of
church
and
state
quietly
desperately
consciously
they
have
marched
to
the
gates
of
death
to
gain
the
liberty
which
the
feminine
spirit
has
desired
in
savage
life
as
well
as
in
barbarism
and
civilization
has
instinctive
urge
to
freedom
and
a
wider
development
asserted
itself
in
an
effort
successful
or
otherwise
to
curtail
her
family
the
custom
of
infanticide
prevails
or
has
prevailed
says
westermark
in
his
monumental
work
origin
and
development
of
the
moral
not
only
in
the
savage
world
but
among
the
and
civilized
races
with
the
savage
mother
family
limitation
ran
largely
to
infanticide
although
that
practice
was
frequently
accompanied
by
abortion
as
a
tribal
means
as
mclennan
says
in
his
studies
in
ancient
history
infanticide
was
formerly
very
common
among
the
savages
of
new
zealand
and
it
was
generally
perpetrated
by
the
mother
he
notes
much
the
same
state
of
affairs
among
the
primitive
australians
except
that
abortion
was
frequently
employed
in
numerous
north
american
indian
tribes
he
says
infanticide
and
abortion
were
not
uncommon
and
the
indians
of
central
america
were
found
by
him
to
have
gone
to
extremes
in
the
use
of
abortives
when
a
traveller
reproached
the
women
of
one
of
the
south
american
indian
tribes
for
the
practice
of
infanticide
mclennan
says
he
was
met
by
the
retort
men
have
no
business
to
meddle
with
affairs
mclennan
ventures
the
opinion
that
the
practice
of
abortion
so
widely
noted
among
indians
in
the
western
hemisphere
must
have
supervened
on
a
practice
of
infanticide
similar
practices
have
been
found
to
prevail
wherever
historians
have
dug
deep
into
the
life
of
savage
people
infanticide
at
least
was
practiced
by
african
tribes
by
the
primitive
peoples
of
japan
india
and
western
europe
as
well
as
in
china
and
in
early
greece
and
rome
the
ancient
hebrews
are
sometimes
pointed
out
as
the
one
possible
exception
to
this
practice
because
the
mosaic
law
as
it
has
come
down
to
us
is
silent
upon
the
subject
westermark
is
of
the
opinion
that
it
hardly
occurred
among
the
hebrews
in
historic
times
but
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
at
an
earlier
period
among
them
as
among
other
branches
of
the
semitic
race
child
murder
was
frequently
practiced
as
a
sacrificial
rite
westermark
found
that
the
murder
of
female
infants
whether
by
the
direct
employment
of
homicidal
means
or
exposure
to
privation
and
neglect
has
for
ages
been
a
common
practice
or
even
a
genuine
custom
among
various
hindu
castes
still
further
light
is
shed
upon
the
real
sources
of
the
practice
as
well
as
upon
the
improvement
of
the
status
of
woman
through
the
practice
by
an
english
student
of
conditions
in
india
captain
charles
macpherson
of
the
madras
army
in
the
journal
of
the
royal
asiatic
society
for
said
i
can
here
but
very
briefly
advert
to
the
customs
and
feelings
which
the
practice
of
infanticide
among
the
khonds
of
orissa
alternately
springs
from
and
produces
the
influence
and
privileges
of
women
are
exceedingly
great
among
the
khonds
and
are
i
believe
greatest
among
the
tribes
which
practice
infanticide
their
opinions
have
great
weight
in
all
public
and
private
affairs
their
direct
participation
is
often
considered
essential
in
the
former
if
infanticide
did
not
spring
from
a
desire
within
the
woman
herself
from
a
desire
stronger
than
motherhood
would
it
prevail
where
women
enjoy
an
influence
equal
to
that
of
men
and
does
not
the
fact
that
the
women
in
question
do
enjoy
such
influence
point
unmistakably
to
the
motive
behind
the
practice
infanticide
did
not
go
out
of
fashion
with
the
advance
from
savagery
to
barbarism
and
civilization
rather
it
became
as
in
greece
and
rome
a
recognized
custom
with
advocates
among
leaders
of
thought
and
action
so
did
abortion
which
some
authorities
regard
as
a
development
springing
from
infanticide
and
tending
to
supersede
it
as
a
means
of
getting
rid
of
undesired
children
as
progress
is
made
toward
civilization
infanticide
then
actually
increased
this
tendency
was
noted
by
westermark
who
also
calls
attention
to
the
conclusions
of
fison
and
howitt
in
kamilaroi
and
kurnai
fison
who
has
lived
for
a
long
time
among
uncivilized
races
says
westermark
thinks
it
will
be
found
that
infanticide
is
far
less
common
among
the
lower
savages
than
among
the
more
advanced
tribes
following
this
same
tendency
into
civilized
countries
we
find
infanticide
either
advocated
by
philosophers
and
authorized
by
law
as
in
greece
and
rome
or
widely
practiced
in
spite
of
the
law
civil
and
ecclesiastical
the
status
of
infanticide
as
an
established
legalized
custom
in
greece
is
well
summed
up
by
westermark
who
says
the
exposure
of
deformed
or
sickly
infants
was
undoubtedly
an
ancient
custom
in
greece
in
sparta
at
least
it
was
enjoined
by
law
it
was
also
approved
of
by
the
most
enlightened
among
the
greek
philosophers
plato
condemns
all
those
children
who
are
imperfect
in
limbs
as
well
as
those
who
are
born
of
depraved
citizens
aristotle
who
believed
that
the
state
should
fix
the
number
of
children
each
married
pair
should
have
has
this
to
say
in
book
vii
chapter
v
with
respect
to
the
exposing
and
nurturing
of
children
let
it
be
a
law
that
nothing
mutilated
shall
be
nurtured
and
in
order
to
avoid
having
too
great
a
number
of
children
if
it
be
not
permitted
by
the
laws
of
the
country
to
expose
them
it
is
then
requisite
to
define
how
many
a
man
may
have
and
if
any
have
more
than
the
prescribed
number
some
means
must
be
adopted
that
the
fruit
be
destroyed
in
the
womb
of
the
mother
before
sense
and
life
are
generated
in
it
aristotle
was
a
conscious
advocate
of
family
limitation
even
if
attained
by
violent
means
it
is
necessary
he
says
to
take
care
that
the
increase
of
the
people
should
not
exceed
a
certain
number
in
order
to
avoid
poverty
and
its
concomitants
sedition
and
other
evils
in
athens
while
the
citizen
wives
were
unable
to
throw
off
the
restrictions
of
the
laws
which
kept
them
at
home
the
great
number
of
or
stranger
women
were
the
glory
of
the
golden
age
the
homes
of
these
women
who
were
free
from
the
burden
of
too
many
children
became
the
gathering
places
of
philosophers
poets
sculptors
and
statesmen
the
were
their
companions
their
inspiration
and
their
teachers
aspasia
one
of
the
greatest
women
of
antiquity
was
such
an
emancipated
individuality
true
to
the
urge
of
the
feminine
spirit
she
like
sappho
the
poetess
of
lesbia
sought
to
arouse
the
greek
wives
to
the
expression
of
their
individual
selves
one
writer
says
of
her
efforts
this
woman
determined
to
do
her
utmost
to
elevate
her
sex
the
one
method
of
culture
open
to
women
at
that
time
was
poetry
there
was
no
other
form
of
literature
and
accordingly
she
systematically
trained
her
pupils
to
be
poets
and
to
weave
into
the
verse
the
noblest
maxims
of
the
intellect
and
the
deepest
emotions
of
the
heart
young
pupils
with
richly
endowed
minds
flocked
to
her
from
all
countries
and
formed
a
kind
of
college
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
these
young
women
were
impelled
to
seek
the
society
of
sappho
from
disgust
with
the
low
drudgery
and
monotonous
routine
to
which
woman
life
was
sacrificed
and
they
were
anxious
to
rise
to
something
nobler
and
better
can
there
be
any
doubt
that
the
unfortunate
citizen
wives
of
athens
bound
by
law
to
their
homes
envied
the
brilliant
careers
of
the
stranger
women
and
sought
all
possible
means
of
freedom
and
can
there
be
any
doubt
that
they
acquiesced
in
the
practice
of
infanticide
as
a
means
to
that
end
otherwise
how
could
the
custom
of
destroying
infants
have
been
so
thoroughly
embedded
in
the
jurisprudence
the
thought
and
the
very
core
of
athenian
civilization
as
to
the
spartan
women
aristotle
says
that
they
ruled
their
husbands
and
owned
of
the
land
surely
had
they
not
approved
of
infanticide
for
some
very
strong
reasons
of
their
own
they
would
have
abolished
it
athens
and
sparta
must
be
regarded
as
giving
very
strong
indications
that
the
grecian
women
not
only
approved
of
family
limitation
by
the
destruction
of
unwanted
children
but
that
at
least
part
of
their
motive
was
personal
freedom
in
rome
an
avowedly
militaristic
nation
living
by
conquest
of
weaker
states
all
sound
children
were
saved
but
the
weakly
or
deformed
were
drowned
says
seneca
we
destroy
monstrous
births
and
we
also
drown
our
children
if
they
are
born
weakly
or
unnaturally
formed
wives
of
romans
however
were
relieved
of
much
of
the
drudgery
of
child
rearing
by
the
slaves
which
rome
took
by
the
thousands
and
brought
home
thus
they
were
free
to
attain
an
advanced
position
and
to
become
the
advisors
of
their
husbands
in
politics
making
and
unmaking
political
careers
when
we
come
to
look
into
the
proverbial
infanticide
of
the
chinese
we
find
the
same
positive
indications
that
it
grew
out
of
the
instinctive
purpose
of
woman
to
free
herself
from
the
bondage
of
too
great
reproductivity
in
the
poorest
districts
of
china
says
westermark
female
infants
are
often
destroyed
by
their
parents
immediately
after
their
birth
chiefly
on
account
of
poverty
though
disapproved
of
by
educated
chinese
the
practice
is
treated
with
forbearance
or
indifference
by
the
man
of
the
people
and
is
acquiesced
in
by
the
mandarins
when
seriously
appealed
to
on
the
subject
says
the
rev
doolittle
in
life
of
the
though
all
deprecate
it
as
contrary
to
the
dictates
of
reason
and
the
instincts
of
nature
many
are
ready
boldly
to
apologize
for
it
and
declare
it
to
be
necessary
especially
in
the
families
of
the
excessively
poor
here
again
the
wide
prevalence
of
the
custom
is
the
first
and
best
proof
that
women
are
driven
by
some
great
pressure
within
themselves
to
accede
to
it
if
further
proof
were
necessary
it
is
afforded
by
the
testimony
of
occidentals
who
have
lived
in
china
that
chinese
midwives
are
extremely
skillful
in
producing
early
abortion
abortions
are
not
performed
without
the
consent
and
usually
only
at
the
demand
of
the
woman
in
china
as
in
india
the
religions
of
the
country
condemned
even
as
they
condemn
infanticide
both
foreign
and
native
governments
have
sought
to
make
an
end
of
the
custom
but
in
both
countries
it
still
prevails
nor
are
these
eastern
countries
substantially
different
from
their
western
neighbors
the
record
of
western
europe
is
summarized
by
oscar
helmuth
werner
in
his
book
the
unmarried
mother
in
german
literature
infanticide
says
werner
was
the
most
common
crime
in
western
europe
from
the
middle
ages
down
to
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
this
fact
of
course
means
that
it
was
even
more
largely
practiced
by
the
married
than
the
unmarried
the
married
mothers
being
far
greater
in
number
another
problem
which
confronted
the
church
he
says
in
another
place
was
the
practice
of
exposure
and
killing
of
children
by
legal
parents
a
sort
of
final
word
from
werner
is
this
infanticide
by
legal
parents
has
practically
ceased
in
civilized
countries
but
abortion
its
substitute
has
not
how
desperately
woman
desired
freedom
to
develop
herself
as
an
individual
apart
from
motherhood
is
indicated
by
the
fact
that
infanticide
was
the
most
common
crime
of
western
europe
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
some
of
the
most
terrible
punishments
ever
inflicted
by
law
were
meted
out
to
those
women
who
sought
this
means
of
escape
from
the
burden
of
unwanted
children
werner
shows
that
in
germany
for
instance
in
the
year
it
was
the
law
that
those
guilty
of
infanticide
were
to
be
buried
alive
or
impaled
in
order
to
prevent
desperation
however
they
shall
be
drowned
if
it
is
possible
to
get
to
a
stream
or
river
in
which
they
shall
be
torn
with
glowing
tongs
beforehand
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
at
one
time
in
germany
the
punishment
was
that
of
drowning
in
a
sack
containing
a
serpent
a
cat
and
a
dog
in
order
that
the
utmost
agony
might
be
inflicted
one
sovereign
alone
condemned
women
to
death
for
infanticide
without
noticeably
reducing
the
practice
in
spite
of
the
huge
numbers
of
abortions
and
the
multiplication
of
foundlings
homes
and
orphans
asylums
infanticide
is
still
an
occasional
crime
in
all
countries
as
to
woman
share
in
the
practice
let
us
add
this
word
from
havelock
ellis
taken
from
the
chapter
on
morbid
psychic
phenomena
in
his
book
and
infanticide
is
the
crime
in
which
women
stand
out
in
the
greatest
contrast
to
men
in
italy
for
example
for
every
men
guilty
of
infanticide
there
are
women
and
he
remarks
later
that
when
a
man
commits
this
crime
he
usually
does
it
at
the
instance
of
some
woman
infanticide
tends
to
disappear
as
skill
in
producing
abortions
is
developed
or
knowledge
of
contraceptives
is
spread
and
only
then
one
authority
as
will
be
seen
in
a
later
chapter
estimates
the
number
of
abortions
performed
annually
in
the
united
states
at
and
another
believes
that
double
that
number
are
produced
among
the
hindus
and
mohammedans
artificial
abortion
is
extremely
common
says
westermark
in
persia
every
illegitimate
pregnancy
ends
with
abortion
in
turkey
both
among
the
rich
and
the
poor
even
married
women
very
commonly
procure
abortion
after
they
have
given
birth
to
two
children
one
of
which
is
a
boy
the
nations
mentioned
are
typical
of
the
world
except
those
countries
where
information
concerning
contraceptives
has
enabled
women
to
limit
their
families
without
recourse
to
operations
it
is
apparent
that
nothing
short
of
contraceptives
can
put
an
end
to
the
horrors
of
abortion
and
infanticide
the
roman
catholic
church
which
has
fought
these
practices
from
the
beginning
has
been
unable
to
check
them
and
no
more
powerful
agency
could
have
been
brought
into
play
it
took
that
church
even
in
the
days
of
its
unlimited
power
many
centuries
to
come
to
its
present
sweeping
condemnation
of
abortion
the
severity
of
the
condemnation
depended
upon
the
time
at
which
the
development
of
the
foetus
was
interfered
with
an
illuminating
resume
of
the
church
efforts
in
this
direction
is
given
by
william
burke
ryan
in
his
authoritative
and
exhaustive
study
entitled
its
law
prevalence
prevention
and
history
ryan
says
theologians
of
the
church
of
rome
made
a
distinction
between
the
inanimate
and
the
animate
foetus
to
which
the
soul
is
added
by
the
creation
of
god
and
adopted
the
opinions
of
some
of
the
old
philosophers
more
particularly
those
of
aristotle
as
to
animation
in
the
male
and
female
but
the
canon
law
altogether
negatived
the
doctrine
of
the
stoics
for
innocent
ii
condemned
the
following
proposition
seems
probable
that
the
foetus
does
not
possess
a
rational
soul
as
long
as
it
is
in
the
womb
and
only
begins
to
possess
it
when
born
and
consequently
in
no
abortion
is
homicide
committed
sextus
v
inflicted
severe
penalties
for
the
crime
of
abortion
at
any
period
these
were
in
some
degree
mitigated
by
gregory
xiv
who
however
still
held
that
those
producing
the
abortion
of
an
animated
foetus
should
be
subject
to
them
and
excommunication
reserved
to
the
bishop
and
also
an
reserved
to
the
pope
himself
for
absolution
the
roman
church
stands
firmly
upon
the
proposition
that
directly
intended
artificial
abortion
must
be
regarded
as
wrongful
killing
as
murder
footnote
pastoral
medicine
but
it
required
a
long
time
for
it
to
reach
that
point
in
the
face
of
the
demand
for
relief
from
large
families
as
it
was
with
the
fight
of
the
church
against
abortion
so
it
is
with
the
effort
to
prevent
abortion
in
the
united
states
all
efforts
to
stop
the
practice
are
futile
apparently
the
numbers
of
these
illegal
operations
are
increasing
from
year
to
year
from
year
to
year
more
women
will
undergo
the
humiliation
the
danger
and
the
horror
of
them
and
the
terrible
record
begun
with
the
infanticide
of
the
primitive
peoples
will
go
on
piling
up
its
volume
of
human
misery
and
racial
damage
until
society
awakens
to
the
fact
that
a
fundamental
remedy
must
be
applied
to
apply
such
a
remedy
society
must
recognize
the
terrible
lesson
taught
by
the
innumerable
centuries
of
infanticide
and
foeticide
if
these
abhorrent
practices
could
have
been
ended
by
punishment
and
suppression
they
would
have
ceased
long
ago
but
to
continue
suppression
and
punishment
and
let
the
matter
rest
there
is
only
to
miss
the
lesson
only
to
permit
conditions
to
go
from
bad
to
worse
what
is
that
lesson
it
is
this
woman
desire
for
freedom
is
born
of
the
feminine
spirit
which
is
the
absolute
elemental
inner
urge
of
womanhood
it
is
the
strongest
force
in
her
nature
it
can
not
be
destroyed
it
can
merely
be
diverted
from
its
natural
expression
into
violent
and
destructive
channels
the
chief
obstacles
to
the
normal
expression
of
this
force
are
undesired
pregnancy
and
the
burden
of
unwanted
children
these
obstacles
have
always
been
and
always
will
be
swept
aside
by
a
considerable
proportion
of
women
driven
by
the
irresistible
force
within
them
they
will
always
seek
wider
freedom
and
greater
regardless
of
the
cost
the
sole
question
that
society
has
to
answer
is
how
shall
women
be
permitted
to
attain
this
end
are
you
horrified
at
the
record
set
down
in
this
chapter
it
is
well
that
you
should
be
you
can
not
help
society
to
apply
the
fundamental
remedy
unless
you
know
these
facts
and
are
conscious
of
their
fullest
significance
society
in
dealing
with
the
feminine
spirit
has
its
choice
of
clearly
defined
alternatives
it
can
continue
to
resort
to
violence
in
an
effort
to
enslave
the
elemental
urge
of
womanhood
making
of
woman
a
mere
instrument
of
reproduction
and
punishing
her
when
she
revolts
or
it
can
permit
her
to
choose
whether
she
shall
become
a
mother
and
how
many
children
she
will
have
it
can
go
on
trying
to
crush
that
which
is
uncrushable
or
it
can
recognize
woman
claim
to
freedom
and
cease
to
impose
diverting
and
destructive
barriers
if
we
choose
the
latter
course
we
must
not
only
remove
all
restrictions
upon
the
use
of
scientific
contraceptives
but
we
must
legalize
and
encourage
their
use
this
problem
comes
home
with
peculiar
force
to
the
people
of
america
do
we
want
the
millions
of
abortions
performed
annually
to
be
multiplied
do
we
want
the
precious
tender
qualities
of
womanhood
so
much
needed
for
our
racial
development
to
perish
in
these
sordid
abnormal
experiences
or
do
we
wish
to
permit
woman
to
find
her
way
to
fundamental
freedom
through
safe
unobjectionable
scientific
means
we
have
our
choice
upon
our
answer
to
these
questions
depends
in
a
tremendous
degree
the
character
and
the
capabilities
of
the
future
american
race
chapter
iii
the
materials
of
the
new
race
each
of
us
has
an
ideal
of
what
the
american
of
the
future
should
be
we
have
been
told
times
without
number
that
out
of
the
mixture
of
stocks
the
intermingling
of
ideas
and
aspirations
there
is
to
come
a
race
greater
than
any
which
has
contributed
to
the
population
of
the
united
states
what
is
the
basis
for
this
hope
that
is
so
generally
indulged
in
if
the
hope
is
founded
upon
realities
how
may
it
be
realized
to
understand
the
difficulties
and
the
obstacles
to
be
overcome
before
the
dream
of
a
greater
race
in
america
can
be
attained
is
to
understand
something
of
the
task
before
the
women
who
shall
give
birth
to
that
race
what
material
is
there
for
a
greater
american
race
what
elements
make
up
our
present
millions
where
do
they
live
how
do
they
live
in
what
direction
does
our
national
civilization
bend
their
ideals
what
is
the
effect
of
the
melting
pot
upon
the
foreigner
once
he
begins
to
melt
are
we
now
producing
a
freer
juster
more
intelligent
more
idealistic
creative
people
out
of
the
varied
ingredients
here
before
we
can
answer
these
questions
we
must
consider
briefly
the
races
which
have
contributed
to
american
population
among
our
more
than
population
are
negroes
indians
chinese
and
other
colored
people
to
the
number
of
there
are
also
persons
of
foreign
birth
besides
these
there
are
children
of
parents
and
persons
whose
fathers
or
mothers
were
born
on
foreign
soil
making
a
total
of
people
of
foreign
stock
fifty
per
cent
of
our
population
is
of
the
native
white
strain
of
the
foreign
stock
in
the
united
states
the
last
general
census
compiled
in
shows
that
per
cent
was
german
per
cent
was
irish
per
cent
was
russian
or
finnish
was
english
per
cent
italian
and
per
cent
austrian
the
abstract
of
the
same
census
points
out
several
significant
facts
the
western
european
strains
in
this
country
are
represented
by
a
majority
of
children
of
or
mixed
parentage
this
is
because
the
immigration
from
those
sources
has
been
checked
on
the
other
hand
immigration
from
southern
and
eastern
europe
including
russia
and
finland
increased
per
cent
from
to
during
that
period
the
slums
of
europe
dumped
their
submerged
inhabitants
into
america
at
a
rate
almost
double
that
of
the
preceding
decade
and
the
flow
was
still
increasing
at
the
time
the
census
was
taken
so
it
is
more
than
likely
that
when
the
next
census
is
taken
it
will
be
found
that
following
there
was
an
even
greater
flow
from
spain
italy
hungary
austria
russia
finland
and
other
countries
where
the
iron
hand
of
economic
and
political
tyrannies
had
crushed
great
populations
into
ignorance
and
want
these
peoples
have
not
been
in
the
united
states
long
enough
to
produce
great
families
the
census
of
will
in
all
probability
tell
a
story
of
a
greater
and
more
serious
problem
than
did
the
last
over
of
all
the
immigrants
over
fourteen
years
of
age
admitted
during
the
two
decades
preceding
were
illiterate
of
the
who
arrived
in
the
period
could
not
read
or
write
there
were
illiterate
foreigners
in
the
united
states
when
the
census
was
taken
do
these
elements
give
promise
of
a
better
race
are
we
doing
anything
genuinely
constructive
to
overcome
this
situation
of
the
white
foreign
stock
in
the
united
states
live
in
cities
of
the
populations
of
chicago
and
new
york
are
of
this
stock
more
than
of
the
populations
of
boston
cleveland
detroit
buffalo
pittsburgh
milwaukee
newark
jersey
city
providence
worcester
scranton
paterson
fall

minneapolis
and
san

are
of
other
than
native
white
ancestry
of
the
fifty
principal
cities
of
the
united
states
there
are
only
fourteen
in
which
fifty
per
cent
of
the
population
is
of
unmixed
native
white
parentage
only
one
state
in
the
union
north
carolina
has
less
than
one
per

of
the
white
foreign
stock
new

new

delaware
massachusetts
connecticut
rhode
island
michigan
illinois
wisconsin
minnesota
the
dakotas

and

have
more

fifty

eleven

including
those
on

maine
ohio
and
kansas
have
from
to
per
cent
maryland
indiana
missouri
and
texas
have
from
to
per

these
proportions
are
increasing
rather
than
decreasing
owing
to
the
extraordinarily
high
birth
rate
of
the
foreign
strains
a
special
analysis
of
vital
statistics
for
certain
states
in
the
world
almanac
for
shows
that
mothers
gave
birth
to
nearly
per

of
the
children
born
in
connecticut
nearly
per

in
massachusetts
nearly
per

in

nearly
per

in

more
than
per

in
new
hampshire
more
than
per

in
new

and
more
than
per
cent
in
pennsylvania
all
these
figures
be
it
remembered
fail
to
include
foreign
stock
of
the
second
generation
after
landing
if
the
statistics
for
children
who
have
native
parents
but
grandparents
or
who
have
one
parent
were
given
they
would
doubtless
leave
but
a
small
percentage
of
births
from
stocks
native
to
the
soil
for
several
generations
immigrants
or
their
children
constitute
the
majority
of
workers
employed
in
many
of
our
industries
seven
out
of
ten
of
those
who
work
in
our
iron
and
steel
industries
are
drawn
from
this
class
says
the
national
geographic
magazine
february
seven
out
of
ten
of
our
bituminous
coal
miners
belong
to
it
three
out
of
four
who
work
in
packing
towns
were
born
abroad
or
are
children
of
those
who
were
born
abroad
four
out
of
five
of
those
who
make
our
silk
goods
seven
out
of
eight
of
those
employed
in
woolen
mills
nine
out
of
ten
of
those
who
refine
our
petroleum
and
nineteen
out
of
twenty
of
those
who
manufacture
our
sugar
are
immigrants
or
the
children
of
immigrants
and
it
might
have
shown
a
similarly
high
percentage
of
those
in
the
clothing
industries
railway
and
public
works
construction
of
the
less
skilled
sort
and
a
number
of
others
that
these
foreigners
who
have
come
in
hordes
have
brought
with
them
their
ignorance
of
hygiene
and
modern
ways
of
living
and
that
they
are
handicapped
by
religious
superstitions
is
only
too
true
but
they
also
bring
in
their
hearts
a
desire
for
freedom
from
all
the
tyrannies
that
afflict
the
earth
they
would
not
be
here
if
they
did
not
bear
within
them
the
hardihood
of
pioneers
a
courage
of
no
mean
order
they
have
the
simple
faith
that
in
america
they
will
find
equality
liberty
and
an
opportunity
for
a
decent
livelihood
and
they
have
something
else
the
cell
plasms
of
these
peoples
are
freighted
with
the
potentialities
of
the
best
in
old
world
civilization
they
come
from
lands
rich
in
the
traditions
of
courage
of
art
music
letters
science
and
philosophy
americans
no
longer
consider
themselves
cultured
unless
they
have
journeyed
to
these
lands
to
find
access
to
the
treasures
created
by
men
and
women
of
this
same
blood
the
immigrant
brings
the
possibilities
of
all
these
things
to
our
shores
but
where
is
the
opportunity
to
reproduce
in
the
new
world
the
cultures
of
the
old
what
opportunities
have
we
given
to
these
peoples
to
enrich
our
civilization
we
have
greeted
them
as
a
lot
of
ignorant
foreigners
we
have
shouted
at
bustled
and
kicked
them
our
industries
have
taken
advantage
of
their
ignorance
of
the
country
ways
to
take
their
toil
in
mills
and
mines
and
factories
at
starvation
wages
we
have
herded
them
into
slums
to
become
diseased
to
become
social
burdens
or
to
die
we
have
huddled
them
together
like
rabbits
to
multiply
their
numbers
and
their
misery
instead
of
saying
that
we
americanize
them
we
should
confess
that
we
animalize
them
the
only
freedom
we
seem
to
have
given
them
is
the
freedom
to
make
heavier
and
more
secure
their
chains
what
hope
is
there
for
racial
progress
in
this
human
material
treated
more
carelessly
and
brutally
than
the
cheapest
factory
product
nor
are
all
our
social
handicaps
bound
up
in
the
immigrant
there
were
in
the
united
states
when
the
federal
industrial
relations
committee
finished
its
work
in
several
million
migratory
workers
most
of
them
white
many
of
them
married
but
separated
from
their
families
who
were
compelled
like
themselves
to
struggle
with
dire
want
there
were
in
more
than
tenant
farmers
of
whom
lived
and
worked
under
the
terrible
conditions
which
the
industrial
relations
commission
report
showed
to
prevail
in
the
south
and
southwest
these
tenant
farmers
as
the
report
showed
were
always
in
want
and
were
compelled
by
the
very
terms
of
the
prevailing
tenant
contracts
to
produce
children
who
must
go
to
the
fields
and
do
the
work
of
adults
the
census
proved
that
this
tenancy
was
on
the
increase
the
number
of
tenants
in
all
but
the
new
england
and
middle
atlantic
states
having
increased
approximately
per
cent
from
to
moreover
there
were
in
the
united
states
in
illiterates
of
these
were
of
pure
native
white
stock
in
some
states
in
the
south
as
much
as
per
cent
of
the
population
is
illiterate
many
of
these
of
course
being
negroes
there
is
still
another
factor
to
be
considered
a
factor
which
because
of
its
great
scope
is
more
ominous
than
any
yet
mentioned
this
is
the
underpaid
mass
of
workers
in
the
united
states
workers
whose
low
wages
are
forcing
them
deeper
into
want
each
day
let
senator
borah
not
a
radical
nor
even
a
reformer
but
a
leader
of
the
republican
party
tell
the
story
per
cent
of
the
families
in
the
united
states
have
incomes
of
or
less
said
he
in
a
speech
before
the
senate
august
seventy
per
cent
of
the
families
of
our
country
have
incomes
of
or
less
tell
me
how
a
man
so
situated
can
have
shelter
for
his
family
how
he
can
provide
food
and
clothing
he
is
an
industrial
peon
his
home
is
scant
and
pinched
beyond
the
power
of
language
to
tell
he
sees
his
wife
and
children
on
the
ragged
edge
of
hunger
from
week
to
week
and
month
to
month
if
sickness
comes
he
faces
suicide
or
crime
he
can
not
educate
his
children
he
can
not
fit
them
for
citizenship
he
can
not
even
fit
them
as
soldiers
to
die
for
their
country
it
is
the
tragedy
of
our
whole
national
life
how
these
people
live
in
such
times
as
these
we
have
not
yet
gathered
the
fruits
of
such
an
industrial
condition
in
this
country
we
have
been
saved
thus
far
by
reason
of
the
newness
of
our
national
life
our
vast
public
lands
now
almost
exhausted
our
great
natural
resources
now
fast
being
seized
and
held
but
the
hour
of
reckoning
will
come
senator
borah
was
thinking
doubtless
of
open
revolution
of
bloodshed
and
the
destruction
of
property
in
a
far
more
terrible
sense
the
reckoning
which
he
has
referred
to
is
already
upon
us
the
ills
we
suffer
as
the
result
of
the
conditions
now
prevailing
in
the
united
states
are
appalling
in
their
sum
it
is
these
conditions
that
produce
the
child
laborers
of
the
united
states
child
slaves
who
undergo
hardships
that
blight
them
physically
and
mentally
leaving
them
fit
only
to
produce
human
beings
whose
deficiencies
and
misfortunes
will
exceed
their
own
from
these
same
elements
living
under
these
same
conditions
come
the
feebleminded
and
other
defectives
just
how
many
feebleminded
there
are
in
the
united
states
no
one
knows
because
no
attempt
has
ever
been
made
to
give
public
care
to
all
of
them
and
families
are
more
inclined
to
conceal
than
to
reveal
the
mental
defects
of
their
members
estimates
vary
from
at
the
present
time
to
nearly
as
early
as
henry
goddard
ph
of
the
vineland
training
school
being
authority
for
the
latter
statement
only
of
these
unfortunates
were
under
institutional
care
in
the
united
states
in
the
rest
being
free
to
propagate
their
kind
piling
up
public
burdens
for
future
generations
the
feebleminded
are
notoriously
prolific
in
reproduction
the
close
relationship
between
poverty
and
ignorance
and
the
production
of
feebleminded
is
shown
by
anne
moore
in
a
report
to
the
public
education
association
of
new
york
in
she
found
that
an
overwhelming
proportion
of
the
classified
feebleminded
children
in
new
york
schools
came
from
large
families
living
in
overcrowded
slum
conditions
and
that
only
a
small
percentage
were
born
of
native
parents
sixty
thousand
prostitutes
go
and
come
anew
each
year
in
the
united
states
this
army
of
unfortunates
as
social
workers
and
scientists
testify
come
from
families
living
under
like
conditions
of
want
in
the
new
york
city
schools
alone
in
december
per
cent
of
the
children
were
suffering
from
undernourishment
and
per
cent
in
immediate
danger
of
it
these
facts
also
the
result
of
the
conditions
outlined
were
discovered
by
the
city
bureau
of
child
hygiene
another
item
in
the
sordid
list
is
that
of
venereal
disease
in
his
pamphlet
entitled
venereal
issued
in
hermann
biggs
head
of
the
new
york
state
department
of
health
quoted
authorities
who
gave
estimates
of
the
amount
of
syphilis
and
gonorrhea
in
the
united
states
one
says
that
per
cent
of
the
men
contract
one
disease
or
the
other
at
some
time
another
said
that
per
cent
of
the
population
of
new
york
city
had
syphilis
one
of
the
most
terrible
of
all
maladies
poverty
delayed
marriage
prostitution
a
brief
and
terrible
chain
accounts
for
this
scourge
finally
there
is
tuberculosis
bred
by
bad
housing
conditions
and
contributed
to
in
frightful
measure
by
poor
food
and
unhealthy
surroundings
during
the
hours
of
employment
frederick
hoffman
director
of
the
national
association
for
the
study
and
prevention
of
tuberculosis
and
foremost
statistical
authority
upon
tuberculosis
in
the
united
states
says
we
know
of
tubercular
persons
in
the
united
states
does
this
picture
horrify
the
reader
this
is
not
the
whole
truth
a
few
scattered
statistics
lack
the
power
to
reflect
the
broken
lives
of
overworked
fathers
the
ceaseless
increasing
pain
of
overburdened
mothers
and
the
agony
of
childhood
fighting
its
way
against
the
handicaps
of
ill
health
insufficient
food
inadequate
training
and
stifling
toil
can
we
expect
to
remedy
this
situation
by
dismissing
the
problem
of
the
submerged
native
elements
with
legislative
palliatives
or
treating
it
with
careless
scorn
do
we
better
it
by
driving
out
of
the
immigrant
heart
the
dream
of
liberty
that
brought
him
to
our
shores
do
we
solve
the
problem
by
giving
him
instead
of
an
opportunity
to
develop
his
own
culture
low
wages
a
home
in
the
slums
and
those
preachments
which
constitute
our
americanization
every
detail
of
this
sordid
situation
means
a
problem
that
must
be
solved
before
we
can
even
clear
the
way
for
a
greater
race
in
america
nor
is
there
any
hope
of
solving
any
of
these
problems
if
we
continue
to
attack
them
in
the
usual
way
men
have
sentimentalized
about
them
and
legislated
upon
them
they
have
denounced
them
and
they
have
applied
reforms
but
it
has
all
been
ridiculously
cruelly
futile
this
is
the
condition
of
things
for
which
those
stand
who
demand
more
and
more
children
each
child
born
under
such
conditions
but
makes
them
worse
each
child
in
its
own
person
suffers
the
consequence
of
the
intensified
evils
if
we
are
to
develop
in
america
a
new
race
with
a
racial
soul
we
must
keep
the
birth
rate
within
the
scope
of
our
ability
to
understand
as
well
as
to
educate
we
must
not
encourage
reproduction
beyond
our
capacity
to
assimilate
our
numbers
so
as
to
make
the
coming
generation
into
such
physically
fit
mentally
capable
socially
alert
individuals
as
are
the
ideal
of
a
democracy
the
intelligence
of
a
people
is
of
slow
evolutional
development
it
lags
far
behind
the
reproductive
ability
it
is
far
too
slow
to
cope
with
conditions
created
by
an
increasing
population
unless
that
increase
is
carefully
regulated
we
must
therefore
not
permit
an
increase
in
population
that
we
are
not
prepared
to
care
for
to
the
best
advantage
that
we
are
not
prepared
to
do
justice
to
educationally
and
economically
we
must
popularize
birth
control
thinking
we
must
not
leave
it
haphazardly
to
be
the
privilege
of
the
already
privileged
we
must
put
this
means
of
freedom
and
growth
into
the
hands
of
the
masses
we
must
set
motherhood
free
we
must
give
the
foreign
and
submerged
mother
knowledge
that
will
enable
her
to
prevent
bringing
to
birth
children
she
does
not
want
we
know
that
in
each
of
these
submerged
and
semisubmerged
elements
of
the
population
there
are
rich
factors
of
racial
culture
motherhood
is
the
channel
through
which
these
cultures
flow
motherhood
when
free
to
choose
the
father
free
to
choose
the
time
and
the
number
of
children
who
shall
result
from
the
union
automatically
works
in
wondrous
ways
it
refuses
to
bring
forth
weaklings
refuses
to
bring
forth
slaves
refuses
to
bear
children
who
must
live
under
the
conditions
described
it
withholds
the
unfit
brings
forth
the
fit
brings
few
children
into
homes
where
there
is
not
sufficient
to
provide
for
them
instinctively
it
avoids
all
those
things
which
multiply
racial
handicaps
under
such
circumstances
we
can
hope
that
the
melting
pot
will
refine
we
shall
see
that
it
will
save
the
precious
metals
of
racial
culture
fused
into
an
amalgam
of
physical
perfection
mental
strength
and
spiritual
progress
such
an
american
race
containing
the
best
of
all
racial
elements
could
give
to
the
world
a
vision
and
a
leadership
beyond
our
present
imagination
chapter
iv
two
classes
of
women
thus
far
we
have
been
discussing
mainly
one
class
in
america
the
workers
most
women
who
belong
to
the
workers
families
have
no
accurate
or
reliable
knowledge
of
contraceptives
and
are
therefore
bringing
children
into
the
world
so
rapidly
that
they
their
families
and
their
class
are
overwhelmed
with
numbers
out
of
these
numbers
as
has
been
shown
have
grown
many
of
the
burdens
with
which
society
in
general
is
weighted
out
of
them
have
come
also
the
want
disease
hard
living
conditions
and
general
misery
of
the
workers
the
women
of
this
class
are
the
greatest
sufferers
of
all
not
only
do
they
bear
the
material
hardships
and
deprivations
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
family
but
in
the
case
of
the
mother
these
are
intensified
it
is
the
man
and
the
child
who
have
first
call
upon
the
insufficient
amount
of
food
it
is
the
man
and
the
child
who
get
the
recreation
if
there
is
any
to
be
had
for
the
man
hours
of
labor
are
usually
limited
by
law
or
by
his
labor
union
it
is
the
woman
who
suffers
first
from
hunger
the
woman
whose
clothing
is
least
adequate
the
woman
who
must
work
all
hours
even
though
she
is
not
compelled
as
in
the
case
of
millions
to
go
into
a
factory
to
add
to
her
husband
scanty
income
it
is
she
too
whose
health
breaks
first
and
most
hopelessly
under
the
long
hours
of
work
the
drain
of
frequent
childbearing
and
often
almost
constant
nursing
of
babies
there
are
no
laws
to
protect
the
mother
against
overwork
and
toil
in
the
home
no
laws
to
protect
her
against
ill
health
and
the
diseases
of
pregnancy
and
reproduction
in
fact
there
has
been
almost
no
thought
or
consideration
given
for
the
protection
of
the
mother
in
the
home
of
the
workingman
there
are
no
general
health
statistics
to
tell
the
full
story
of
the
physical
ills
suffered
by
women
as
a
result
of
too
great
reproductivity
but
we
get
some
light
upon
conditions
through
the
statistics
on
maternal
mortality
compiled
by
grace
meigs
for
the
children
bureau
of
the
united
states
department
of
labor
these
figures
do
not
include
the
deaths
of
women
suffering
from
diseases
complicated
by
pregnancy
in
in
this
country
at
least
women
it
is
estimated
died
from
conditions
caused
by
childbirth
about
of
these
died
from
childbed
fever
and
the
remaining
from
diseases
now
known
to
be
to
a
great
extent
preventable
or
curable
says
meigs
in
her
summary
physicians
and
statisticians
agree
that
these
figures
are
a
think
of
it
the
needless
deaths
of
women
a
great
underestimate
yet
even
this
number
means
that
virtually
every
hour
of
the
day
and
night
two
women
die
as
the
result
of
childbirth
in
the
healthiest
and
supposedly
the
most
progressive
country
in
the
world
it
is
apparent
that
meigs
leaves
out
of
consideration
the
many
thousands
of
deaths
each
year
of
women
who
become
pregnant
while
suffering
from
tuberculosis
adolphus
knopf
addressing
the
annual
convention
of
the
american
public
health
association
in
cincinnati
in
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
some
authors
hold
that
per
cent
of
the
women
afflicted
with
tuberculosis
even
when
afflicted
only
in
the
relatively
early
and
curable
stages
die
as
the
result
of
pregnancy
which
could
have
been
avoided
and
their
lives
saved
had
they
but
known
some
means
of
prevention
nor
were
syphilis
various
kidney
and
heart
disorders
and
other
diseases
often
rendered
fatal
by
pregnancy
taken
into
account
by
meigs
survey
still
leaving
out
all
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
women
who
die
because
pregnancy
has
complicated
serious
diseases
meigs
finds
that
in
the
death
rate
per
of
the
population
from
all
conditions
caused
by
childbirth
was
little
lower
than
that
from
typhoid
fever
this
rate
would
be
almost
quadrupled
if
only
the
group
of
the
population
which
can
be
affected
women
of
ages
were
considered
in
childbirth
caused
more
deaths
among
women
to
years
old
than
any
disease
except
tuberculosis
from
what
sort
of
homes
come
these
deaths
from
childbirth
most
of
them
occur
in
overcrowded
dwellings
where
food
care
sanitation
nursing
and
medical
attention
are
inadequate
where
do
we
find
most
of
the
tuberculosis
and
much
of
the
other
disease
which
is
aggravated
by
pregnancy
in
the
same
sort
of
home
the
deadly
chain
of
misery
is
all
too
plain
to
anyone
who
takes
the
trouble
to
observe
it
a
woman
of
the
working
class
marries
and
with
her
husband
lives
in
a
degree
of
comfort
upon
his
earnings
her
household
duties
are
not
beyond
her
strength
then
the
children
begin
to
come
one
two
three
four
possibly
five
or
more
the
earnings
of
the
husband
do
not
increase
as
rapidly
as
the
family
does
food
clothing
and
general
comfort
in
the
home
grow
less
as
the
numbers
of
the
family
increase
the
woman
work
grows
heavier
and
her
strength
is
less
with
each
child
possibly
probably
she
has
to
go
into
a
factory
to
add
to
her
husband
earnings
there
she
toils
doing
her
housework
at
night
her
health
goes
and
the
crowded
conditions
and
lack
of
necessities
in
the
home
help
to
bring
about
disease
especially
tuberculosis
under
the
circumstances
the
woman
chances
of
recovering
from
each
succeeding
childbirth
grow
less
less
too
are
the
chances
of
the
child
surviving
as
shown
by
tables
in
another
chapter
unwanted
children
poverty
ill
health
misery
death
these
are
the
links
in
the
chain
and
they
are
common
to
most
of
the
families
in
the
class
described
in
the
preceding
chapter
nor
is
the
full
story
of
the
woman
sufferings
yet
told
grievous
as
is
her
material
condition
her
spiritual
deprivations
are
still
greater
by
the
very
fact
of
its
existence
mother
love
demands
its
expression
toward
the
child
by
that
same
fact
it
becomes
a
necessary
factor
in
the
child
development
the
mother
of
too
many
children
in
a
crowded
home
where
want
ill
health
and
antagonism
are
perpetually
created
is
deprived
of
this
simplest
personal
expression
she
can
give
nothing
to
her
child
of
herself
of
her
personality
training
is
impossible
and
sympathetic
guidance
equally
so
instead
such
a
mother
is
tired
nervous
irritated
and
a
determent
often
instead
of
a
help
to
her
children
motherhood
becomes
a
disaster
and
childhood
a
tragedy
it
goes
without
saying
that
this
woman
loses
also
all
opportunity
of
personal
expression
outside
her
home
she
has
neither
a
chance
to
develop
social
qualities
nor
to
indulge
in
social
pleasures
the
feminine
element
in
her
that
spirit
which
blossoms
forth
now
and
then
in
women
free
from
such
burdens
can
not
assert
itself
she
can
contribute
nothing
to
the
wellbeing
of
the
community
she
is
a
breeding
machine
and
a
drudge
she
is
not
an
asset
but
a
liability
to
her
neighborhood
to
her
class
to
society
she
can
be
nothing
as
long
as
she
is
denied
means
of
limiting
her
family
in
sharp
contrast
with
these
women
who
ignorantly
bring
forth
large
families
and
who
thereby
enslave
themselves
we
find
a
few
women
who
have
one
two
or
three
children
or
no
children
at
all
these
women
with
the
exception
of
the
childless
ones
live
lives
they
are
found
not
only
in
the
ranks
of
the
rich
and
the
but
in
the
ranks
of
labor
as
well
they
have
but
one
point
of
basic
difference
from
their
enslaved
sisters
they
are
not
burdened
with
the
rearing
of
large
families
we
have
no
need
to
call
upon
the
historian
the
sociologist
nor
the
statistician
for
our
knowledge
of
this
situation
we
meet
it
every
day
in
the
ordinary
routine
of
our
lives
the
women
who
are
the
great
teachers
the
great
writers
the
artists
musicians
physicians
the
leaders
of
public
movements
the
great
suffragists
reformers
labor
leaders
and
revolutionaries
are
those
who
are
not
compelled
to
give
lavishly
of
their
physical
and
spiritual
strength
in
bearing
and
rearing
large
families
the
situation
is
too
familiar
for
discussion
where
a
woman
with
a
large
family
is
contributing
directly
to
the
progress
of
her
times
or
the
betterment
of
social
conditions
it
is
usually
because
she
has
sufficient
wealth
to
employ
trained
nurses
governesses
and
others
who
perform
the
duties
necessary
to
child
rearing
she
is
a
rarity
and
is
universally
recognized
as
such
the
women
with
small
families
however
are
free
to
make
their
choice
of
those
social
pleasures
which
are
the
right
of
every
human
being
and
necessary
to
each
one
full
development
they
can
be
and
are
each
according
to
her
individual
capacity
comrades
and
companions
to
their
husbands
a
privilege
denied
to
the
mother
of
many
children
theirs
is
the
opportunity
to
keep
abreast
of
the
times
to
make
and
cultivate
a
varied
circle
of
friends
to
seek
amusements
as
suits
their
taste
and
means
to
know
the
meaning
of
real
recreation
all
these
things
remain
unrealized
desires
to
the
prolific
mother
women
who
have
a
knowledge
of
contraceptives
are
not
compelled
to
make
the
choice
between
a
maternal
experience
and
a
marred
love
life
they
are
not
forced
to
balance
motherhood
against
social
and
spiritual
activities
motherhood
is
for
them
to
choose
as
it
should
be
for
every
woman
to
choose
choosing
to
become
mothers
they
do
not
thereby
shut
themselves
away
from
thorough
companionship
with
their
husbands
from
friends
from
culture
from
all
those
manifold
experiences
which
are
necessary
to
the
completeness
and
the
joy
of
life
fit
mothers
of
the
race
are
these
the
courted
comrades
of
the
men
they
choose
rather
than
the
slaves
of
slaves
for
theirs
is
the
magic
power
the
power
of
limiting
their
families
to
such
numbers
as
will
permit
them
to
live
lives
such
lives
are
the
expression
of
the
feminine
spirit
which
is
woman
all
of
not
merely
art
nor
professional
skill
nor
intellect
but
all
that
woman
is
or
may
achieve
chapter
v
the
wickedness
of
creating
large
families
the
most
serious
evil
of
our
times
is
that
of
encouraging
the
bringing
into
the
world
of
large
families
the
most
immoral
practice
of
the
day
is
breeding
too
many
children
these
statements
may
startle
those
who
have
never
made
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
problem
they
are
nevertheless
well
considered
and
the
truth
of
them
is
abundantly
borne
out
by
an
examination
of
facts
and
conditions
which
are
part
of
everyday
experience
or
observation
the
immorality
of
large
families
lies
not
only
in
their
injury
to
the
members
of
those
families
but
in
their
injury
to
society
if
one
were
asked
offhand
to
name
the
greatest
evil
of
the
day
one
might
in
the
light
of
one
education
by
the
newspapers
or
by
agitators
make
any
one
of
a
number
of
replies
one
might
say
prostitution
the
oppression
of
labor
child
labor
or
war
yet
the
poverty
and
neglect
which
drives
a
girl
into
prostitution
usually
has
its
source
in
a
family
too
large
to
be
properly
cared
for
by
the
mother
if
the
girl
is
not
actually
subnormal
because
her
mother
bore
too
many
children
and
therefore
the
more
likely
to
become
a
prostitute
labor
is
oppressed
because
it
is
too
plentiful
wages
go
up
and
conditions
improve
when
labor
is
scarce
large
families
make
plentiful
labor
and
they
also
provide
the
workers
for
the
factories
as
well
as
the
armies
of
unemployed
that
population
swelled
by
overbreeding
is
a
basic
cause
of
war
we
shall
see
in
a
later
chapter
without
the
large
family
not
one
of
these
evils
could
exist
to
any
considerable
extent
much
less
to
the
extent
that
they
exist
the
large
family
especially
the
family
too
large
to
receive
adequate
care
is
the
one
thing
necessary
to
the
perpetuation
of
these
and
other
evils
and
is
therefore
a
greater
evil
than
any
one
of
them
first
of
the
manifold
immoralities
involved
in
the
producing
of
a
large
family
is
the
outrage
upon
the
womanhood
of
the
mother
if
no
mother
bore
children
against
her
will
or
against
her
feminine
instinct
there
would
be
few
large
families
the
average
mother
of
a
baby
every
year
or
two
has
been
forced
into
unwilling
motherhood
so
far
as
the
later
arrivals
are
concerned
it
is
not
the
less
immoral
when
the
power
which
compels
enslavement
is
the
church
state
or
the
propaganda
of
patriots
clamoring
against
race
suicide
the
wrong
is
as
great
as
if
the
enslaving
force
were
the
unbridled
passions
of
her
husband
the
wrong
to
the
unwilling
mother
deprived
of
her
liberty
and
all
opportunity
of
is
in
itself
enough
to
condemn
large
families
as
immoral
the
outrage
upon
the
woman
does
not
end
there
however
excessive
childbearing
is
now
recognized
by
the
medical

as
one
of
the
most
prolific
causes
of

in

there
are
in
america
hundreds
of
thousands
of
women
in
good
health
when
they
married
who
have
within
a
few
years
become
physical
wrecks
incapable
of
mothering
their

incapable
of

or
the
limitation
of
knows
that
too
frequent
childbirth
nursing
and
the
sleepless
nights
that
are
required
in
bringing
up
a
child
exhaust
the
vitality
of
thousands
of
mothers
make
them
prematurely
old
or
turn
them
into
chronic
invalids
the
effect
of
the
large
family
upon
the
father
is
only
less
disastrous
than
it
is
upon
the
mother
the
spectacle
of
the
young
man
happy
in
health
strength
and
the
prospect
of
a
joyful
love
life
makes
us
smile
in
sympathy
but
this
same
young
man
ten
years
later
is
likely
to
present
a
spectacle
as
sorry
as
it
is
familiar
if
he
finds
that
the
children
come
one
after
another
at
short
intervals
so
fast
indeed
that
no
matter
how
hard
he
works
nor
how
many
hours
he
can
not
keep
pace
with
their

the

have

into
a
disheartened
threadbare
incompetent
whom
all
the
world
pities
or
despises
instead
of
being
the
happy
competent
father
supporting
one
or
two
children
as
they
should
be
supported
he
is
the
frantic
struggler
against
the
burden
of
five
or
six
with
the
tragic
prospect
of
several
more
the
ranks
of
the
physically
weakened
mentally
dejected
and
spiritually
hopeless
young
fathers
of
large
families
attest
all
too
strongly
the
immorality
of
the
system
if
its
effects
upon
the
mother
and
the
father
were
not
enough
to
condemn
the
large
family
as
an
institution
its
effects
upon
the
child
would
make
the
case
against
it
conclusive
in
the
united
states
some
children
under
one
year
of
age
die
each
twelve
months
approximately
ninety
per
cent
of
these
deaths
are
directly
or
indirectly
due
to
malnutrition
to
other
diseased
conditions
resulting
from
poverty
or
to
excessive
childbearing
by
the
mother
the
direct
relationship
between
the
size
of
the
family
and
the
death
of
children
less
than
one
year
old
has
been
revealed
by
a
number
of
studies
of
the
infant
death
rate
one
of
the
clearest
of
these
was
that
made
by
arthur
geissler
among
miners
and
cited
by
alfred
ploetz
before
the
first
international
eugenic
congress
footnote
problems
in
eugenics
london
taking
births
from
unselected
marriages
and
omitting
families
having
one
and
two
children
geissler
got
this
result
deaths
during
first
year
born
children
thus
we
see
that
the
second
and
third
children
have
a
very
good
chance
to
live
through
the
first
year
children
arriving
later
have
less
and
less
chance
until
the
twelfth
has
hardly
any
chance
at
all
to
live
twelve
months
this
does
not
complete
the
case
however
for
those
who
care
to
go
farther
into
the
subject
will
find
that
many
of
those
who
live
for
a
year
die
before
they
reach
the
age
of
five
many
perhaps
will
think
it
idle
to
go
farther
in
demonstrating
the
immorality
of
large
families
but
since
there
is
still
an
abundance
of
proof
at
hand
it
may
be
offered
for
the
sake
of
those
who
find
difficulty
in
adjusting
ideas
to
the
facts
the
most
merciful
thing
that
the
large
family
does
to
one
of
its
infant
members
is
to
kill
it
the
same
factors
which
create
the
terrible
infant
mortality
rate
and
which
swell
the
death
rate
of
children
between
the
ages
of
one
and
five
operate
even
more
extensively
to
lower
the
health
rate
of
the
surviving
members
moreover
the
overcrowded
homes
of
large
families
reared
in
poverty
further
contribute
to
this
condition
lack
of
medical
attention
is
still
another
factor
so
that
the
child
who
must
struggle
for
health
in
competition
with
other
members
of
a
closely
packed
family
has
still
great
difficulties
to
meet
after
its
poor
constitution
and
malnutrition
have
been
accounted
for
the
probability
of
a
child
handicapped
by
a
weak
constitution
an
overcrowded
home
inadequate
food
and
care
and
possibly
a
deficient
mental
equipment
winding
up
in
prison
or
an
almshouse
is
too
evident
for
comment
every
jail
hospital
for
the
insane
reformatory
and
institution
for
the
feebleminded
cries
out
against
the
evils
of
too
prolific
breeding
among
we
shall
see
when
we
come
to
consider
the
relation
of
voluntary
motherhood
to
the
rights
of
labor
and
to
the
prevention
of
war
that
the
large
family
of
the
worker
makes
possible
his
oppression
and
that
it
also
is
the
chief
cause
of
such
human
holocausts
as
the
one
just
closed
after
the
four
and
a
half
bloodiest
years
in
history
no
such
extended
consideration
is
necessary
to
indicate
from
what
source
the
young
slaves
in
the
factories
come
they
come
from
large
impoverished
families
from
families
in
which
the
older
children
must
put
their
often
feeble
strength
to
the
task
of
supporting
the
younger
the
immorality
of
bringing
large
families
into
the
world
is
recognized
by
those
who
are
combatting
the

writing

as

how
many
are
too
many
any
more
than
the
mother
can
look
after
and
the
father
make
a

injure
their

but
indirectly

and
if

and

who
has
studied
the
problem
the
size
of
the
family
has
a
direct
bearing
on
the
lives
of
thousands
of
girls
who
are
living
in
prostitution
poverty
lack
of
care
and
training
during
adolescence
overcrowded
housing
conditions
which
accompany
large
families
are
universally
recognized
causes
of
waywardness
in
girls
social
workers
have
cried
out
in
vain
against
these
conditions
pointing
to
their
inevitable
results
in
the
foreword
to
downward
paths
maude
royden
says
intimately
connected
with
this
aspect
of
the
question
is
that
of
home
and
housing
especially
of
the
child
the
age
at
which
children
are
first
corrupted
is
almost
incredibly
early
until
we
consider
the
nature
of
the
surroundings
in
which
they
grow
up
insufficient
space
the
herding
together
of
all
ages
and
both
sexes
these
things
break
down
the
barriers
of
a
natural
modesty
and
reserve
where
decency
is
practically
impossible
unchastity
will
follow
and
follow
almost
as
a
matter
of
course
and
the
child
who
has
no
place
to
play
except
in
the
street
who
lacks
mother
care
whose
chief
emotional
experience
is
the
longing
for
the
necessities
of
life
we
know
too
well
the
end
of
the
sorry
tale
the
forlorn
figures
of
the
shadows
where
lurk
the
girls
who
sell
themselves
that
they
may
eat
and
be
clothed
rise
up
to
damn
the
moral
dogmatists
who
mouth
their
sickening
exhortations
to
the
wives
and
mothers
of
the
workers
to
breed
breed
breed
the
evidence
is
conclusive
as
regards
the
large
family
of
the
social
workers
physicians
and
reformers
cry
out
to
stop
the
breeding
of
these
who
must
exist
in
want
until
they
become
permanent
members
of
the
ranks
of
the
unfit
but
what
of
the
family
of
the
wealthy
or
the
merely
it
is
among
these
classes
that
we
find
the
women
who
have
attained
to
voluntary
motherhood
it
is
to
these
classes
too
that
the
race
suicide
alarmists
have
from
time
to
time
addressed
specially
emphasized
pleas
for
more
children
the
advocates
of
more
prolific
breeding
urge
that
these
same
women
have
more
intelligence
better
health
more
time
to
care
for
children
and
more
means
to
support
them
they
therefore
declare
that
it
is
the
duty
of
such
women
to
populate
the
land
with
strong
healthy
intelligent
offspring
to
bear
children
in
great
numbers
it
is
high
time
to
expose
the
sheer
foolishness
of
this
argument
the
first
absurdity
is
that
the
women
who
are
in
comfortable
circumstances
could
continue
to
be
cultured
and
of
social
value
if
they
were
the
mothers
of
large
families
neither
could
they
maintain
their
present
standard
of
health
nor
impart
it
to
their
children
while
it
is
true
that
they
have
resources
at
their
command
which
ease
the
burden
of
and
child
rearing
immeasurably
it
is
also
true
that
the
wealthy
mother
as
well
as
the
mother
must
give
from
her
own
system
certain
elements
which
it
takes
time
to
replace
excessive
childbearing
is
harder
on
the
woman
who
lacks
care
than
on
the
one
who
does
not
but
both
alike
must
give
their
bodies
time
to
recover
from
the
strain
of
childbearing
if
the
women
in
fortunate
circumstances
gave
ear
to
the
demand
of
masculine
a
fanatics
they
could
within
a
few
years
be
down
to
the
condition
of
their
sisters
who
lack
time
to
cultivate
their
talents
and
intellects
a
vigorous
intelligent
fruitfully
cultured
motherhood
is
all
but
impossible
if
no
restriction
is
placed
by
that
motherhood
upon
the
number
of
children
footnote
a
interesting
and
perhaps
surprising
light
is
thrown
upon
the
origin
of
the
term
race
suicide
by
the
following
quotation
from
an
article
by
harold
bolce
in
the
cosmopolitan
new
york
for
may
sole
effect
of
prolificacy
is
to
fill
the
cemeteries
with
tiny
graves
sacrifices
of
the
innocents
to
the
moloch
of
immoderate
maternity
thus
insists
edward
ross
professor
of
sociology
in
the
university
of
wisconsin
and
he
protests
against
the
of
women
and
the
cheapening
of
men
as
regards
the
restriction
of
the
birth
rate
as
a
at
bottom
salutary
and
its
evils
minor
transient
and
curable
this
is
virile
gospel
and
particularly
significant
coming
from
the
teacher
who
invented
the
term
suicide
which
many
have
erroneously
attributed
to
mr
roosevelt
and
salaried
people
have
a
vital
interest
in
the
size
of
the
families
of
those
better
situated
in
life
large
families
among
the
rich
are
immoral
not
only
because
they
invade
the
natural
right
of
woman
to
the
control
of
her
own
body
to
and
to
but
because
they
are
oppressive
to
the
poorer
elements
of
society
if
the
upper
and
middle
classes
of
society
had
kept
pace
with
the
poorer
elements
of
society
in
reproduction
during
the
past
fifty
years
the
working
class
would
be
forced
down
to
the
level
of
the
chinese
whose
wage
standard
is
said
to
be
a
few
handfuls
of
rice
a
day
if
these
considerations
are
not
enough
to
halt
the
masculine
advocate
of
large
families
who
reminds
us
of
the
days
of
our
mothers
and
grandmothers
let
it
be
remembered
that
bearing
and
rearing
six
or
eight
children
is
a
far
different
matter
from
what
it
was
in
the
generations
just
preceding
physically
and
nervously
the
woman
of

not
fitted
to
bear
children
as
frequently
as
was
her
mother
and
her
mother
mother
the
high
tension
of
modern
life
and
the
complicating
of
woman
everyday
existence
have
doubtless
contributed
to
this
result
and
who
of
us
can
say
until
a
careful
scientific
investigation
is
made
how
much
the
rapid
development
of
tuberculosis
and
other
grave
diseases
even
among
the
may
be
due
to
the
depletion
of
the
physical
capital
of
the
unborn
by
the
too
prolific
childbearing
of
preceding
generations
of
mothers
the
immorality
of
bringing
into
being
a
large
family
is
a
shared
by
three
the
mother
the
father
and
society
upon
all
three
falls
the
burden
of
guilt
it
may
be
said
for
the
mother
and
father
that
they
are
usually
ignorant
what
shall
be
said
of
society
what
shall
be
said
of
us
who
permit
outworn
laws
and
customs
to
persist
in
piling
up
the
appalling
sum
of
public
expense
misery
and
spiritual
degradation
the
indictment
against
the
large
unwanted
family
is
written
in
human
woe
who
in
the
light
of
intelligent
understanding
shall
have
the
brazenness
to
stand
up
and
defend
it
one
thing
we
know
the
woman
who
has
escaped
the
chains
of
too
great
reproductivity
will
never
again
wear
them
the
birth
rate
of
the
wealthy
and
upper
classes
will
never
appreciably
rise
the
woman
of
these
classes
is
free
of
her
most
oppressive
bonds
being
free
we
have
a
right
to
expect
much
of
her
we
expect
her
to
give
still
greater
expression
to
her
feminine
spirit
we
expect
her
to
enrich
the
intellectual
artistic
moral
and
spiritual
life
of
the
world
we
expect
her
to
demolish
old
systems
of

a
degenerate
prudery
religious
concepts
laws

enslave
women
by
denying
them
the
knowledge

the
scrapheap
of
vicious
things
hers

there

her

strike
the

blow

her

before
we
pass
to
a
further
consideration
of
our
subject
shall
we
not
pause
to
take
a
still
closer
look
at
the
human
misery
wrought
by
the
enslavement
of
women
through
unwilling
motherhood
would
you
know
the
appalling
sum
of
this
misery
better
than
any
author
any
scientist
any
physician
any
social
worker
can
tell
you
hear
the
story
from
the
lips
of
the
women
themselves
learn
at
first
hand
what
it
means
to
make
a
broken
drudge
of
a
woman
who
might
have
been
the
happy
mother
of
a
few
strong
children
learn
from
the
words
of
the
victims
of
involuntary
motherhood
what
it
means
to
them
to
their
children
and
to
society
to
force
the
physically
unfit
or
the
unwilling
to
bear
children
when
you
have
learned
stop
to
ask
yourself
what
is
the
worth
of
the
law
the
moral
code
the
tradition
the
religion
that
for
the
sake
of
an
outworn
dogma
of
submission
would
wreck
the
lives
of
these
women
condemn
their
progeny
to
pain
want
disease
and
helplessness
ask
yourself
if
these
letters
these
cries
of
despair
born
of
the
anguish
of
woman
sex
slavery
are
not
in
themselves
enough
to
stop
the
mouths
of
the
demagogues
the
imperialists
and
the
ecclesiastics
who
clamor
for
more
and
yet
more
children
and
if
the
pain
of
others
has
no
power
to
move
your
heart
and
stir
your
hands
and
brain
to
action
ask
yourself
the
more
selfish
question
can
the
children
of
these
unfortunate
mothers
be
other
than
a
burden
to
society
a
burden
which
reflects
itself
in
innumerable
phases
of
cost
crime
and
general
social
detriment
for
our
own
sakes
for
our
children
sakes
plead
the
mothers
help
us
let
us
be
women
rather
than
breeding
machines
the
women
who
thus
cry
out
are
pleading
not
only
for
themselves
and
their
children
but
for
society
itself
their
plea
is
for
us
and
ours
it
is
the
plea
for
happier
conditions
for
higher
ideals
for
a
stronger
more
vigorous
more
highly
developed
race
the
letters
in
this
chapter
are
the
voices
of
humble
prophets
crying
out
to
us
stop
our
national
habit
of
human
waste
they
are
warnings
against
disaster
which
we
now
share
and
must
continue
to
share
as
it
grows
worse
unless
we
heed
the
warning
and
put
our
national
house
in
order
each
and
every
unwanted
child
is
likely
to
be
in
some
way
a
social
liability
it
is
only
the
wanted
child
who
is
likely
to
be
a
social
asset
if
we
have
faith
in
this
intuitive
demand
of
the
unfortunate
mothers
if
we
understand
both
its
dire
and
its
hopeful
significance
we
shall
dispose
of
those
social
problems
which
so
insistently
and
menacingly
confront
us
today
for
the
instinct
of
maternity
to
protect
its
own
fruits
the
instinct
of
womanhood
to
be
free
to
give
something
besides
surplus
of
children
to
the
world
can
not
go
astray
the
rising
generation
is
always
the
material
of
progress
and
motherhood
is
the
agency
for
the
improvement
and
the
strengthening
and
guiding
of
that
generation
the
excerpts
contained
in
this
chapter
are
typical
of
the
letters
which
come
to
me
by
the
thousands
they
tell
their
own
story
simply
sometimes
ungrammatically
and
illiterately
but
nevertheless
irresistibly
it
is
the
story
of
slow
murder
of
the
helpless
by
a
society
that
shields
itself
behind
ancient
inhuman
moral
creeds
which
dares
to
weigh
those
dead
creeds
against
the
agony
of
the
living
who
pray
for
the
mercy
of
death
can
a
mother
who
would
rather
die
than
bear
more
children
serve
society
by
bearing
still
others
can
children
carried
through
nine
months
of
dread
and
unspeakable
mental
anguish
and
born
into
an
atmosphere
of
fear
and
anger
to
grow
up
uneducated
and
in
want
be
a
benefit
to
the
world
here
is
what
the
mother
says
i
have
read
in
the
paper
about
you
and
am
very
interested
in
birth
control
i
am
a
mother
of
four
living
children
and
one
dead
the
oldest
and
baby
months
old
i
am
very
nervous
and
sickly
after
my
children
i
would
like
you
to
advise
me
what
to
do
to
prevent
from
having
any
more
as
i
would
rather
die
than
have
another
i
am
keeping
away
from
my
husband
as
much
as
i
can
but
it
causes
quarrels
and
almost
separation
all
my
babies
have
had
marasmus
in
the
first
year
of
their
lives
and
i
almost
lost
my
baby
last
summer
i
always
worry
about
my
children
so
much
my
husband
works
in
a
brass
foundry
it
is
not
a
very
good
job
and
living
is
so
high
that
we
have
to
live
as
cheap
as
possible
i
only
got
rooms
and
kitchen
and
i
do
all
my
work
and
sewing
which
is
very
hard
for
me
shall
this
woman
continue
to
be
forced
into
a
life
of
unnatural
continence
which
further
aggravates
her
ill
health
and
produces
constant
discord
shall
she
go
on
having
children
who
come
into
being
with
a
heritage
of
ill
health
and
poverty
and
who
are
bound
to
become
public
burdens
or
would
it
be
the
better
policy
to
let
motherhood
follow
its
instinct
to
save
itself
its
offspring
and
society
from
these
ills
or
shall
women
be
forced
into
abortion
as
is
testified
by
the
mother
whose
daughters
are
mothers
and
who
in
the
hope
of
saving
them
from
both
slavery
and
the
destruction
of
their
unborn
children
wrote
the
letter
which
follows
i
have
born
and
raised
children
and
i
know
all
the
hardships
of
raising
a
large
family
i
am
now
years
old
and
past
having
children
but
i
have
daughters
that
have
children
each
and
they
say
they
will
die
before
they
will
have
any
more
and
every
now
and
again
they
go
to
a
doctor
and
get
rid
of
one
and
some
day
i
think
it
will
kill
them
but
they
say
they
do
care
for
they
will
be
better
dead
than
live
in
hell
with
a
big
family
and
nothing
to
raise
them
on
it
is
for
there
sakes
i
wish
you
to
give
me
that
information
what
could
the
three
women
mentioned
in
this
letter
contribute
to
the
wellbeing
of
the
future
american
race
nothing
except
by
doing
exactly
what
they
wish
to
do
refusing
to
bear
children
that
they
do
not
want
and
can
not
care
for
their
instinct
is
sound
but
what
is
to
be
said
of
the
position
of
society
at
large
which
forces
women
who
are
in
the
grip
of
a
sound
instinct
to
seek
repeated
abortions
in
order
to
follow
that
instinct
are
we
not
compelling
women
to
choose
between
inflicting
injury
upon
themselves
their
children
and
the
community
and
undergoing
an
abhorrent
operation
which
kills
the
tenderness
and
delicacy
of
womanhood
even
as
it
may
injure
or
kill
the
body
will
the
offspring
of
a
paralytic
who
must
perforce
neglect
the
physical
care
and
training
of
her
children
enhance
the
common
good
by
their
coming
here
is
a
letter
from
a
paralytic
mother
whose
days
and
nights
are
tortured
by
the
thought
of
another
child
and
whose
reason
is
tottering
at
the
prospect
of
leaving
her
children
without
her
care
i
sent
for
a
copy
of
your
magazine
and
now
feel
i
must
write
you
to
see
if
you
can
help
me
i
was
a
high
school
girl
who
married
a
day
laborer
seven
years
ago
in
a
few
months
i
will
again
be
a
mother
the
fourth
child
in
less
than
six
years
while
carrying
my
babies
am
always
partly
paralyzed
on
one
side
do
not
know
the
cause
but
the
doctor
said
at
last
birth
we
must
be
careful
as
i
could
not
stand
having
so
many
children
am
always
very
sick
for
a
long
time
and
have
to
have
chloroform
we
can
afford
help
only
about
weeks
until
i
am
on
my
feet
again
after
confinement
i
work
as
hard
as
i
can
but
my
work
and
my
children
are
always
neglected
i
wonder
if
my
body
does
survive
this
next
birth
if
my
reason
will
it
is
terrible
to
think
of
bringing
these
little
bodies
and
souls
into
the
world
without
means
or
strength
to
care
for
them
and
i
can
see
no
relief
unless
you
give
it
to
me
or
tell
me
where
to
get
it
i
am
weaker
each
time
and
i
know
that
this
must
be
the
last
one
for
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
go
than
to
bring
more
neglected
babies
into
the
world
i
can
hardly
sleep
at
night
for
worrying
is
there
an
answer
for
women
like
me
in
another
chapter
we
have
gotten
a
glimpse
of
the
menace
of
the
feebleminded
here
is
a
woman
who
is
praying
for
help
to
avoid
adding
to
the
number
of
mentally
helpless
my
baby
is
only
months
old
and
the
oldest
one
of
four
is
and
more
care
than
a
baby
has
always
been
helpless
we
do
not
own
a
roof
over
our
heads
and
i
am
so
discouraged
i
want
to
die
if
nothing
can
be
done
ca
you
help
me
just
this
time
and
then
i
know
i
can
take
care
of
myself
ignorance
on
this
all
important
subject
has
put
me
where
i
am
i
do
know
how
to
be
sure
of
bringing
myself
around
i
beg
of
you
to
help
me
and
anything
i
can
do
to
help
further
your
wonderful
work
i
will
do
only
help
me
this
once
no
one
will
know
only
i
will
be
blessed
i
not
only
have
a
terrible
time
when
i
am
confined
but
caring
for
the
oldest
child
it
preys
so
on
my
mind
that
i
fear
more
defective
children
help
me
please
the
offspring
of
one
feebleminded
man
named
jukes
has
cost
the
public
in
one
way
and
another
in
years
do
we
want
more
such
families
is
this
woman
standing
guard
for
the
general
welfare
had
she
been
permitted
the
use
of
contraceptives
before
she
was
forced
to
make
a
vain
plea
for
abortion
would
she
not
have
rendered
a
service
to
her
fellow
citizens
as
well
as
to
herself
millions
are
spent
in
the
united
states
every
year
to
combat
tuberculosis
the
national
waste
involved
in
illness
and
deaths
from
tuberculosis
runs
up
into
the
billions
is
it
then
good
business
to
say
nothing
of
the
humane
aspects
of
the
situation
to
compel
the
writer
of
the
following
letter
to
go
on
adding
to
the
number
of
the
tubercular
which
is
the
guardian
of
public
welfare
here
the
mother
instinct
which
wishes
to
avoid
bearing
tubercular
children
or
the
statute
which
forbids
her
to
know
how
to
avoid
adding
to
the
census
of
white
plague
victims
the
letter
reads
kindly
pardon
me
for
writing
this
to
you
not
knowing
what
trouble
this
may
cause
you
but
i
heard
of
you
through
a
friend
and
realize
you
are
a
friend
of
humanity
if
people
would
see
with
your
light
the
world
would
be
healthy
i
married
the
first
time
when
i
was
eighteen
years
old
a
drinking
man
i
became
mother
to
five
children
in
my
husband
died
of
consumption
i
lost
two
of
my
oldest
children
from
the
same
disease
one
at
and
the
other
at
the
youngest
of
them
all
a
sweet
girl
of
nineteen
now
lies
at
sanatorium
expecting
to
leave
us
at
any
time
the
other
sister
and
brother
look
very
poorly
i
have
always
worked
very
hard
because
i
had
to
in
i
married
again
a
good
man
this
time
but
a
laboring
man
and
our
constant
fear
and
trouble
is
what
may
happen
if
we
bring
children
into
the
world
i
years
old
this
month
and
not
very
well
any
more
either
so
a
godsend
will
be
some
one
who
can
tell
me
how
to
care
for
myself
so
i
can
be
free
from
suffering
and
also
not
bring
mortals
to
earth
to
suffer
and
die
not
even
the
blindest
of
all
dogmatists
can
ignore
the
danger
to
the
community
of
and
the
race
of
in
permitting
an
insane
woman
to
go
on
bearing
children
here
is
a
letter
which
tells
a
story
how
mother
instinct
even
when
clouded
by
periodic
insanity
seeks
to
protect
itself
and
society
and
how
society
prevents
her
from
attaining
that
end
there
is
a
woman
in
this
town
who
has
six
children
and
is
expecting
another
directly
after
the
birth
of
a
child
she
goes
insane
a
raving
maniac
and
they
send
her
to
the
insane
asylum
while
she
is
gone
her
home
and
children
are
cared
for
by
neighbors
after
about
six
months
they
discharge
her
and
she
comes
home
and
is
in
a
family
way
again
in
a
few
months
still
the
doctors
will
do
nothing
for
her
she
is
a
woman
and
says
if
she
would
not
have
any
more
children
she
is
sure
she
could
be
entirely
free
from
these
insane
spells
if
you
will
send
me
one
of
your
pamphlets
i
will
give
it
to
her
and
several
others
equally
deserving
hoping
you
will
see
fit
to
grant
my
request
i
remain
etc
the
very
word
syphilis
brings
a
shudder
to
anyone
who
is
familiar
with
the
horrors
of
the
malady
not
only
in
the
suffering
brought
to
the
victim
himself
and
in
the
danger
of
infecting
others
but
in
the
dire
legacy
of
helplessness
and
disease
which
is
left
to
the
offspring
of
the
syphilitic
is
this
the
most
destructive
socially
of
all
plagues
here
is
a
letter
which
as
a
criticism
of
our
present
public
policy
in
regard
to
national
waste
and
to
contraceptives
defies
comment
i
was
left
without
a
father
when
a
girl
of
fourteen
years
old
i
was
the
oldest
child
of
five
my
mother
had
no
means
of
support
except
her
two
hands
so
we
worked
at
anything
we
could
my
job
being
nurse
girl
at
home
while
mother
worked
most
of
the
time
as
she
could
earn
more
money
than
i
could
for
she
could
do
harder
work
i
was
very
strong
and
finally
after
two
years
my
mother
got
so
tired
and
worn
out
trying
to
make
a
living
for
so
many
she
married
again
and
as
she
married
a
poor
man
we
children
were
not
much
better
off
at
the
age
of
seventeen
i
married
a
man
a
brakeman
on
the
railroad
who
was
eleven
years
older
than
i
he
drank
some
and
was
a
very
man
but
i
was
very
ignorant
of
the
world
and
did
not
think
of
anything
but
making
a
home
for
myself
and
husband
after
eleven
months
i
had
a
little
girl
born
to
me
i
did
not
want
more
children
but
my
told
me
it
was
a
terrible
sin
to
do
anything
to
keep
from
having
children
and
that
the
lord
only
sent
just
what
i
could
take
care
of
and
if
i
heard
of
anything
to
do
i
was
told
it
was
injurious
so
i
did
not
try
in
eleven
months
again
october
i
had
another
little
puny
girl
in
months
i
had
a
boy
in
ten
months
july
i
had
a
baby
that
lived
five
hours
in
eleven
months
june
i
had
another
little
girl
in
seventeen
months
another
boy
in
nine
months
a
four
miscarriage
in
twelve
months
another
girl
and
in
three
and
a
half
years
another
girl
all
of
these
children
were
born
into
poverty
the
father
health
was
always
poor
and
when
the
third
girl
was
born
he
was
discharged
from
the
road
because
of
his
disability
yet
he
was
still
able
to
put
children
into
the
world
when
the
oldest
child
was
twelve
years
old
the
father
died
of
concussion
of
the
brain
while
the
youngest
child
was
born
two
months
after
his
death
now
sanger
i
did
not
want
those
children
because
even
in
my
ignorance
i
had
sense
enough
to
know
that
i
had
no
right
to
bring
those
children
into
such
a
world
where
they
could
not
have
decent
care
for
i
was
not
able
to
do
it
myself
nor
hire
it
done
i
prayed
and
i
prayed
that
they
would
die
when
they
were
born
praying
did
no
good
and
i
have
read
and
studied
enough
to
know
that
i
am
the
mother
of
seven
living
children
and
that
i
committed
a
crime
by
bringing
them
into
the
world
their
father
was
syphilitic
i
did
not
know
about
such
things
when
i
was
a
girl
one
son
is
to
be
sent
to
mexico
while
one
of
my
girls
is
a
victim
of
the
white
slave
traffic
i
raised
my
family
in
a
little
college
town
in
and
am
well
known
there
for
i
made
my
living
washing
and
working
for
the
college
people
while
i
raised
my
little
brood
i
often
wondered
why
those
educated
people
never
had
so
many
children
i
have
one
married
daughter
who
is
tubercular
and
she
also
has
two
little
girls
only
a
year
apart
i
feel
so
bad
about
it
and
write
to
ask
you
to
send
me
information
for
her
do
stop
your
good
work
do
think
it
not
appreciated
for
there
are
hundreds
of
women
like
myself
who
are
not
afraid
to
risk
their
lives
to
help
you
to
get
this
information
to
poor
women
who
need
it
there
is
no
need
to
go
on
repeating
these
cries
these
letters
have
come
to
me
by
the
thousands
there
are
enough
of
them
to
fill
many
volumes
each
with
its
own
individual
tragedy
each
with
its
own
warning
to
society
every
ill
that
we
are
trying
to
cure
is
reflected
in
them
the
wife
who
through
an
unwilling
continence
drives
her
husband
to
prostitution
habitual
drunkenness
which
prohibition
may
or
may
not
have
disposed
of
as
a
social
problem
mothers
who
toil
in
mills
and
whose
children
must
follow
them
to
that
toil
adding
to
the
long
train
of
evils
involved
in
child
labor
mothers
who
have
brought
eight
ten
twelve
or
fifteen
undernourished
weakly
children
into
the
world
to
become
public
burdens
of
one
sort
or
another
all
these
and
more
with
the
economic
problem
and
women
who
are
remaining
unmarried
because
they
fear
a
large
family
which
must
exist
in
want
men
who
are
living
abnormal
lives
for
the
same
reason
all
the
social
handicaps
and
evils
of
the
day
are
woven
into
these
letters
and
out
of
each
of
them
rises
these
challenging
facts
first
oppressed
motherhood
knows
that
the
cure
for
these
evils
lies
in
birth
control
second
society
has
not
yet
learned
to
permit
motherhood
to
stand
guard
for
itself
its
children
the
common
good
and
the
coming
race
and
one
reading
such
letters
and
realizing
their
significance
is
constrained
to
wonder
how
long
such
a
situation
can
exist
chapter
vii
when
should
a
woman
avoid
having
children
are
overburdened
mothers
justified
in
their
appeals
for
contraceptives
or
abortions
what
shall
we
say
to
women
who
write
such
letters
as
those
published
in
the
preceding
chapter
will
anyone
after
reading
those
letters
dare
to
say
to
these
women
that
they
should
go
on
bringing
helpless
children
into
the
world
to
share
their
increasing
misery
the
women
who
thus
cry
for
aid
are
the
victims
of
ignorance
awakening
from
that
ignorance
they
are
demanding
relief
had
they
been
permitted
a
knowledge
of
their
sex
functions
had
they
had
some
guiding
principle
of
motherhood
those
who
at
this
late
day
are
asking
for
contraceptives
would
have
swept
aside
all
barriers
and
procured
them
long
ago
those
who
are
appealing
for
abortions
would
never
have
been
in
such
a
situation
to
say
to
these
women
that
they
should
continue
their
helpless
breeding
of
the
helpless
is
stupid
brutality
the
facts
set
forth
earlier
in
this
book
and
the
cries
of
tortured
motherhood
which
echo
through
the
letters
just
referred
to
are
more
than
ample
evidence
that
there
are
times
when
it
is
woman
highest
duty
to
refuse
to
bear
children
there
has
seemed
to
be
a
great
deal
of
disagreement
among
the
medical
authorities
who
have
attempted
to
say
when
a
woman
should
not
have
children
this
disagreement
has
been
rendered
even
more
confusing
by
a
babel
of
voices
from
the
ranks
of
sociologists
within
the
past
few
years
however
so
much
light
has
been
shed
upon
the
subject
that
it
is
now
comparatively
easy
for
the
student
to
separate
the
conclusions
from
those
which
are
of
doubtful
value
or
plainly
worthless
the
opinions
which
i
summarize
here
are
not
so
much
my
own
originally
as
those
of
medical
authorities
who
have
made
deep
and
careful
investigations
there
is
however
nothing
set
forth
here
which
i
have
not
in
my
own
studies
tested
and
proved
correct
in
addition
to
carrying
the
weight
of
the
best
medical
authority
a
fact
easily
confirmed
by
the
first
specialist
you
meet
they
are
further
reinforced
by
the
findings
of
the
federal
children
bureau
and
other
organizations
which
have
examined
infant
mortality
and
compiled
rates
to
the
woman
who
wishes
to
have
children
we
must
give
these
answers
to
the
question
when
not
to
have
them
childbearing
should
be
avoided
within
two
or
three
years
after
the
birth
of
the
last
child
common
sense
and
science
unite
in
pointing
out
that
the
mother
requires
at
least
this
much
time
to
regain
her
strength
and
replenish
her
system
in
order
to
give
another
baby
proper
nourishment
after
its
birth
authorities
are
insistent
upon
their
warnings
that
too
frequent
childbearing
wrecks
the
woman
health
weakness
of
the
reproductive
organs
and
pelvic
ailments
almost
certainly
result
if
a
woman
bears
children
too
frequently
by
all
means
there
should
be
no
children
when
either
mother
or
father
suffers
from
such
diseases
as
tuberculosis
gonorrhea
syphilis
cancer
epilepsy
insanity
drunkenness
and
mental
disorders
in
the
case
of
the
mother
heart
disease
kidney
trouble
and
pelvic
deformities
are
also
a
serious
bar
to
childbearing
thousands
of
volumes
have
been
written
by
physicians
upon
the
danger
to
mothers
and
offspring
of
having
children
when
one
or
both
parents
are
suffering
from
the
diseases
mentioned
above
as
authorities
have
pointed
out
in
all
these
books
the
jails
hospitals
for
the
insane
poorhouses
and
houses
of
prostitution
are
filled
with
the
children
born
of
such
parents
while
an
astounding
number
of
their
children
are
either
stillborn
or
die
in
infancy
these
facts
are
now
so
well
known
that
they
would
need
little
discussion
here
even
if
space
permitted
miscarriages
which
are
particularly
frequent
in
cases
of
syphilis
and
pelvic
deformities
are
a
great
source
of
danger
to
the
health
and
even
to
the
life
of
the
mother
where
either
parent
suffers
from
gonorrhea
the
child
is
in
danger
of
being
born
blind
tuberculosis
in
the
parent
leaves
the
child
system
in
such
condition
that
it
is
likely
to
suffer
from
the
disease
childbearing
is
also
a
grave
danger
to
the
tubercular
mother
a
tendency
to
insanity
if
not
insanity
itself
may
be
transmitted
to
the
child
or
it
may
be
feebleminded
if
one
of
the
parents
is
insane
or
suffers
from
any
mental
disorder
drunkenness
in
the
parent
or
parents
has
been
found
to
be
the
cause
of
feeblemindedness
in
the
offspring
and
to
leave
the
child
with
a
constitution
too
weak
to
resist
disease
as
it
should
no
more
children
should
be
born
when
the
parents
though
healthy
themselves
find
that
their
children
are
physically
or
mentally
defective
no
matter
how
much
they
desire
children
no
man
and
woman
have
a
right
to
bring
into
the
world
those
who
are
to
suffer
from
mental
or
physical
affliction
it
condemns
the
child
to
a
life
of
misery
and
places
upon
the
community
the
burden
of
caring
for
it
probably
for
its
defective
descendants
for
many
generations
generally
speaking
no
woman
should
bear
a
child
before
she
is
years
old
it
is
better
still
that
she
wait
until
she
is
high
infant
mortality
rates
for
mothers
under
attest
this
fact
it
is
highly
desirable
from
the
mother
standpoint
to
postpone
childbearing
until
she
has
attained
a
ripe
physical
and
mental
development
as
the
bearing
and
nursing
of
infants
interferes
with
such
development
it
is
also
all
important
to
the
child
the
offspring
of
a
woman
who
is
or
somewhat
older
has
the
best
chance
of
good
physical
and
mental
equipment
in
brief
a
woman
should
avoid
having
children
unless
both
she
and
the
father
are
in
such
physical
and
mental
condition
as
to
assure
the
child
a
healthy
physical
and
mental
being
this
is
the
answer
that
must
be
made
to
women
whose
children
are
fairly
sure
of
good
care
sufficient
food
adequate
clothing
a
fit
place
to
live
and
at
least
a
fair
education
a
distinctly
different
and
exceedingly
important
side
of
the
problem
must
be
considered
when
the
women
workers
the
wives
and
the
mothers
of
workers
wish
to
know
when
to
avoid
having
children
such
a
woman
must
answer
her
own
question
what
anyone
else
may
tell
her
is
far
less
important
than
what
she
herself
shall
reply
to
a
society
that
demands
more
and
more
children
and
which
gives
them
less
and
less
when
they
arrive
what
shall
this
woman
say
to
a
society
that
would
make
of
her
body
a
reproductive
machine
only
to
waste
prodigally
the
fruit
of
her
being
does
society
value
her
offspring
does
it
not
let
them
die
by
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
want
hunger
and
preventable
disease
does
it
not
drive
them
to
the
factories
the
mills
the
mines
and
the
stores
to
be
stunted
physically
and
mentally
does
it
not
throw
them
into
the
labor
market
to
be
competitors
with
her
and
their
father
do
we
not
find
the
children
of
the
south
filling
the
mills
working
side
by
side
with
their
mothers
while
the
fathers
remain
at
home
do
we
not
find
the
father
mother
and
child
competing
with
one
another
for
their
daily
bread
does
society
not
herd
them
in
slums
does
it
not
drive
the
girls
to
prostitution
and
the
boys
to
crime
does
it
educate
them
for
manhood
and
womanhood
does
it
even
give
them
during
their
babyhood
fit
places
to
live
in
fit
clothes
to
wear
fit
food
to
eat
or
a
clean
place
to
play
does
it
even
permit
the
mother
to
give
them
a
mother
care
the
woman
of
the
workers
knows
what
society
does
with
her
offspring
knowing
the
bitter
truth
learned
in
unspeakable
anguish
what
shall
this
woman
say
to
society
the
power
is
in
her
hands
she
can
bring
forth
more
children
to
perpetuate
these
conditions
or
she
can
withhold
the
human
grist
from
these
cruel
mills
which
grind
only
disaster
shall
she
say
to
society
that
she
will
go
on
multiplying
the
misery
that
she
herself
has
endured
shall
she
go
on
breeding
children
who
can
only
suffer
and
die
rather
shall
she
not
say
that
until
society
puts
a
higher
value
upon
motherhood
she
will
not
be
a
mother
shall
she
not
sacrifice
her
mother
instincts
for
the
common
good
and
say
that
until
children
are
held
as
something
better
than
commodities
upon
the
labor
market
she
will
bear
no
more
shall
she
not
give
up
her
desire
for
even
a
small
family
and
say
to
society
that
until
the
world
is
made
fit
for
children
to
live
in
she
will
have
no
children
at
all
chapter
viii
birth
control
a
parents
problem
or
woman
the
problem
of
birth
control
has
arisen
directly
from
the
effort
of
the
feminine
spirit
to
free
itself
from
bondage
woman
herself
has
wrought
that
bondage
through
her
reproductive
powers
and
while
enslaving
herself
has
enslaved
the
world
the
physical
suffering
to
be
relieved
is
chiefly
woman
hers
too
is
the
love
life
that
dies
first
under
the
blight
of
too
prolific
breeding
within
her
is
wrapped
up
the
future
of
the
race
it
is
hers
to
make
or
mar
all
of
these
considerations
point
unmistakably
to
one
fact
it
is
woman
duty
as
well
as
her
privilege
to
lay
hold
of
the
means
of
freedom
whatever
men
may
do
she
can
not
escape
the
responsibility
for
ages
she
has
been
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
meet
this
obligation
she
is
now
emerging
from
her
helplessness
even
as
no
one
can
share
the
suffering
of
the
overburdened
mother
so
no
one
can
do
this
work
for
her
others
may
help
but
she
and
she
alone
can
free
herself
the
basic
freedom
of
the
world
is
woman
freedom
a
free
race
can
not
be
born
of
slave
mothers
a
woman
enchained
can
not
choose
but
give
a
measure
of
that
bondage
to
her
sons
and
daughters
no
woman
can
call
herself
free
who
does
not
own
and
control
her
body
no
woman
can
call
herself
free
until
she
can
choose
consciously
whether
she
will
or
will
not
be
a
mother
it
does
not
greatly
alter
the
case
that
some
women
call
themselves
free
because
they
earn
their
own
livings
while
others
profess
freedom
because
they
defy
the
conventions
of
sex
relationship
she
who
earns
her
own
living
gains
a
sort
of
freedom
that
is
not
to
be
undervalued
but
in
quality
and
in
quantity
it
is
of
little
account
beside
the
untrammeled
choice
of
mating
or
not
mating
of
being
a
mother
or
not
being
a
mother
she
gains
food
and
clothing
and
shelter
at
least
without
submitting
to
the
charity
of
her
companion
but
the
earning
of
her
own
living
does
not
give
her
the
development
of
her
inner
sex
urge
far
deeper
and
more
powerful
in
its
outworkings
than
any
of
these
externals
in
order
to
have
that
development
she
must
still
meet
and
solve
the
problem
of
motherhood
with
the
free
woman
who
chooses
a
mate
in
defiance
of
convention
freedom
is
largely
a
question
of
character
and
audacity
if
she
does
attain
to
an
unrestricted
choice
of
a
mate
she
is
still
in
a
position
to
be
enslaved
through
her
reproductive
powers
indeed
the
pressure
of
law
and
custom
upon
the
woman
not
legally
married
is
likely
to
make
her
more
of
a
slave
than
the
woman
fortunate
enough
to
marry
the
man
of
her
choice
look
at
it
from
any
standpoint
you
will
suggest
any
solution
you
will
conventional
or
unconventional
sanctioned
by
law
or
in
defiance
of
law
woman
is
in
the
same
position
fundamentally
until
she
is
able
to
determine
for
herself
whether
she
will
be
a
mother
and
to
fix
the
number
of
her
offspring
this
unavoidable
situation
is
alone
enough
to
make
birth
control
first
of
all
a
woman
problem
on
the
very
face
of
the
matter
voluntary
motherhood
is
chiefly
the
concern
of
the
woman
it
is
persistently
urged
however
that
since
sex
expression
is
the
act
of
two
the
responsibility
of
controlling
the
results
should
not
be
placed
upon
woman
alone
is
it
fair
it
is
asked
to
give
her
instead
of
the
man
the
task
of
protecting
herself
when
she
is
perhaps
less
rugged
in
physique
than
her
mate
and
has
at
all
events
the
normal
periodic
inconveniences
of
her
sex
we
must
examine
this
phase
of
her
problem
in
two
lights
that
of
the
ideal
and
of
the
conditions
working
toward
the
ideal
in
an
ideal
society
no
doubt
birth
control
would
become
the
concern
of
the
man
as
well
as
the
woman
the
hard
inescapable
fact
which
we
encounter
is
that
man
has
not
only
refused
any
such
responsibility
but
has
individually
and
collectively
sought
to
prevent
woman
from
obtaining
knowledge
by
which
she
could
assume
this
responsibility
for
herself
she
is
still
in
the
position
of
a
dependent
because
her
mate
has
refused
to
consider
her
as
an
individual
apart
from
his
needs
she
is
still
bound
because
she
has
in
the
past
left
the
solution
of
the
problem
to
him
having
left
it
to
him
she
finds
that
instead
of
rights
she
has
only
such
privileges
as
she
has
gained
by
petitioning
coaxing
and
cozening
having
left
it
to
him
she
is
exploited
driven
and
enslaved
to
his
desires
while
it
is
true
that
he
suffers
many
evils
as
the
consequence
of
this
situation
she
suffers
vastly
more
while
it
is
true
that
he
should
be
awakened
to
the
cause
of
these
evils
we
know
that
they
come
home
to
her
with
crushing
force
every
day
it
is
she
who
has
the
long
burden
of
carrying
bearing
and
rearing
the
unwanted
children
it
is
she
who
must
watch
beside
the
beds
of
pain
where
lie
the
babies
who
suffer
because
they
have
come
into
overcrowded
homes
it
is
her
heart
that
the
sight
of
the
deformed
the
subnormal
the
undernourished
the
overworked
child
smites
first
and
oftenest
and
hardest
it
is
love
life
that
dies
first
in
the
fear
of
undesired
pregnancy
it
is
her
opportunity
for
self
expression
that
perishes
first
and
most
hopelessly
because
of
it
conditions
rather
than
theories
facts
rather
than
dreams
govern
the
problem
they
place
it
squarely
upon
the
shoulders
of
woman
she
has
learned
that
whatever
the
moral
responsibility
of
the
man
in
this
direction
may
be
he
does
not
discharge
it
she
has
learned
that
lovable
and
considerate
as
the
individual
husband
may
be
she
has
nothing
to
expect
from
men
in
the
mass
when
they
make
laws
and
decree
customs
she
knows
that
regardless
of
what
ought
to
be
the
brutal
unavoidable
fact
is
that
she
will
never
receive
her
freedom
until
she
takes
it
for
herself
having
learned
this
much
she
has
yet
something
more
to
learn
women
are
too
much
inclined
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
men
to
try
to
think
as
men
think
to
try
to
solve
the
general
problems
of
life
as
men
solve
them
if
after
attaining
their
freedom
women
accept
conditions
in
the
spheres
of
government
industry
art
morals
and
religion
as
they
find
them
they
will
be
but
taking
a
leaf
out
of
man
book
the
woman
is
not
needed
to
do
man
work
she
is
not
needed
to
think
man
thoughts
she
need
not
fear
that
the
masculine
mind
almost
universally
dominant
will
fail
to
take
care
of
its
own
her
mission
is
not
to
enhance
the
masculine
spirit
but
to
express
the
feminine
hers
is
not
to
preserve
a
world
but
to
create
a
human
world
by
the
infusion
of
the
feminine
element
into
all
of
its
activities
woman
must
not
accept
she
must
challenge
she
must
not
be
awed
by
that
which
has
been
built
up
around
her
she
must
reverence
that
within
her
which
struggles
for
expression
her
eyes
must
be
less
upon
what
is
and
more
clearly
upon
what
should
be
she
must
listen
only
with
a
frankly
questioning
attitude
to
the
dogmatized
opinions
of
society
when
she
chooses
her
new
free
course
of
action
it
must
be
in
the
light
of
her
own
opinion
of
her
own
intuition
only
so
can
she
give
play
to
the
feminine
spirit
only
thus
can
she
free
her
mate
from
the
bondage
which
he
wrought
for
himself
when
he
wrought
hers
only
thus
can
she
restore
to
him
that
of
which
he
robbed
himself
in
restricting
her
only
thus
can
she
remake
the
world
the
world
is
indeed
hers
to
remake
it
is
hers
to
build
and
to
recreate
even
as
she
has
permitted
the
suppression
of
her
own
feminine
element
and
the
consequent
impoverishment
of
industry
art
letters

ix
continence
is
it
practicable
or
desirable
thousands
of
people
who
agree
that
there
are
times
and
conditions
under
which
it
is
woman
highest
duty
to
avoid
having
children
advocate
continence
as
the
one
permissible
means
of
birth
control
few
of
these
people
agree
with
one
another
however
as
to
what
continence
is
some
have
in
mind
absolute
continence
others
urge
continence
for
periods
varying
from
a
few
weeks
to
many
years
still
others
are
thinking
of
karezza
or
male
continence
as
it
is
sometimes
called
the
majority
of
physicians
and
sex
psychologists
hold
that
the
practice
of
absolute
continence
is
for
the
greater
part
of
the
human
race
an
absurdity
were
such
continence
to
be
practiced
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
a
most
effective
check
upon
the
birth
rate
it
is
seldom
practiced
however
and
when
adhered
to
under
compulsion
the
usual
result
is
injury
to
the
nervous
system
and
to
the
general
health
among
healthy
persons
this
method
is
practicable
only
with
those
who
have
a
degree
of
mentally
controlled
development
as
yet
neither
often
experienced
nor
even
imagined
by
the
mass
of
humanity
absolute
continence
was
the
ideal
of
the
early
christian
church
for
all
of
its
communicants
as
shall
be
seen
in
another
chapter
we
shall
also
see
how
the
church
abandoned
this
standard
and
now
confines
the
doctrine
of
celibacy
to
the
unmarried
to
the
priesthood
and
the
nuns
celibacy
has
been
practiced
in
all
ages
by
a
few
artists
propagandists
and
revolutionists
in
order
that
their
minds
may
be
single
to
the
work
which
has
claimed
their
lives
and
all
the
forces
of
their
beings
may
be
bent
in
one
direction
sometimes
too
such
persons
have
remained
celibate
to
avoid
the
burden
of
caring
for
a
family
the
rev
thomas
robert
malthus
who
in
issued
the
first
of
those
works
which
exemplified
what
is
called
the
malthusian
doctrine
also
advocated
celibacy
or
absolute
continence
until
middle
age
malthus
propounded
the
now
widely
recognized
principle
that
population
tends
to
increase
faster
than
the
food
supply
and
that
unlimited
reproduction
brings
poverty
and
many
other
evils
upon
a
nation
his
theological
training
naturally
inclined
him
to
favor
continence
not
so
much
from
its
practicability
perhaps
as
because
he
believed
that
it
was
the
only
possible
method
we
would
be
ignoring
a
vital
truth
if
we
failed
to
recognize
the
fact
that
there
are
individuals
who
through
absorption
in
religious
zeal
consecration
to
a
cause
or
devotion
to
creative
work
are
able
to
live
for
years
or
for
a
lifetime
a
celibate
existence
it
is
doubtless
true
that
the
number
of
those
who
are
thus
able
to
transmute
their
sex
forces
into
other
creative
forms
is
increasing
it
is
not
with
these
however
that
we
are
concerned
rather
it
is
with
the
mass
of
humanity
who
practice
continence
under
some
sort
of
compulsion
what
is
the
result
of
forcing
continence
upon
those
who
are
not
fitted
or
do
not
desire
to
practice
it
the
majority
opinion
of
medical
science
and
the
evidence
of
statistics
are
united
on
this
point
enforced
continence
is
injurious
often
highly
so
physiology
writes
rutgers
in
teaches
that
every
function
gains
in
power
and
efficiency
through
a
certain
degree
of
control
but
that
the
too
extended
suppression
of
a
desire
gives
rise
to
pathological
disturbances
and
in
time
cripples
the
function
especially
in
the
case
of
women
may
the
damage
entailed
by
too
long
continued
sexual
abstinence
bring
about
deep
disturbances
all
this
be
it
understood
refers
to
persons
of
mature
age
for
young
men
and
women
under
certain
ages
statistics
and
the
preponderance
of
medical
opinion
agree
that
continence
is
highly
advisable
in
many
cases
seemingly
altogether
necessary
to
future
happiness
the
famous
bertillon
of
france
inventor
of
the
bertillon
system
of
measurements
for
the
human
body
has
made
perhaps
the
most
exhaustive
of
all
studies
in
this
direction
he
demonstrates
a
large
mortality
for
the
boy
who
marries
before
his
twentieth
year
when
single
the
mortality
of
french
youths
averages
only
per
thousand
among
married
youths
it
rises
to
per
thousand
which
shows
that
it
is
six
or
eight
times
more
perilous
for
a
youth
to
be
incontinent
than
continent
up
to
that
age
bertillon
conclusions
are
that
men
should
marry
between
their
and
thirtieth
years
and
that
women
should
marry
when
they
have
passed
twenty
with
the
single
exception
of
young
men
and
women
below
the
ages
noted
statistics
tell
a
very
different
story
and
where
it
relates
to
celibates
it
is
a
shocking
one
bertillon
shows
that
in
france
belgium
and
holland
married
men
live
considerably
longer
than
single
ones
writes
charles
drysdale
in
summing
up
the
matter
in
population
and
are
much
less
subject
to
becoming
insane
criminal
or
vicious
from
the
same
studies
we
learn
that
the
conjugal
state
is
also
more
favorable
to
the
health
of
the
woman
over
twenty
years
of
age
in
the
three
countries
covered
an
analysis
of
criminal
records
showed
that
more
than
twice
as
many
unmarried
men
and
women
had
been
held
for
crimes
of
all
kinds
than
married
persons
rates
based
upon
cases
of
insanity
among
men
and
women
in
the
same
countries
showed
per
thousand
for
male
celibates
against
for
married
men
for
single
women
the
rate
was
against
but
for
married
women
insanity
was
reduced
among
women
by
marriage
more
startling
still
is
the
evidence
of
the
mortality
statistics
bertillon
found
that
the
death
rates
of
bachelors
and
widowers
averaged
from
nearly
two
to
nearly
three
times
as
high
as
those
of
married
men
of
the
same
ages
mayer
in
his
showed
that
the
death
rates
among
the
celibate
religious
orders
studied
were
nearly
twice
as
high
as
those
of
the
laity
can
anyone
knowing
the
facts
ask
that
we
recommend
continence
as
a
measure
virtually
all
of
the
dangers
to
health
involved
in
absolute
continence
are
involved
also
in
the
practice
of
continence
broken
only
when
it
is
desired
to
bring
a
child
into
the
world
in
the
opinion
of
some
medical
authorities
it
is
even
worse
because
of
the
almost
constant
excitation
of
unsatisfied
sex
desire
by
the
presence
of
the
mate
people
who
think
that
they
believe
in
this
sort
of
family
limitation
have
much
to
say
about
usually
they
will
admit
that
to
abstain
from
all
but
a
single
act
of
sexual
intercourse
each
year
is
an
indication
of
high
powers
of
yet
that
one
act
performed
only
once
a
year
might
be
sufficient
to
keep
a
woman
with
one
child
in
her
womb
and
another
at
her
breast
during
her
entire
childbearing
period
that
would
mean
from
eighteen
to
children
for
each
mother
provided
she
survived
so
many
births
and
lactations
contraceptives
are
quite
as
necessary
to
these
ones
who
do
not
desire
children
every
year
as
to
those
who
lead
normal
happy
love
lives
from
the
necessity
of
contraceptives
and
from
the
dangers
of
this
limited
continence
certain
persons
are
of
course
relieved
they
are
the
ones
whose
mental
and
spiritual
development
is
so
high
as
to
make
this
practice
natural
to
them
these
individuals
are
so
exceedingly
rare
however
that
they
need
not
be
discussed
here
moreover
they
are
capable
of
solving
their
own
problems
few
who
advocate
the
doctrine
of
absolute
continence
live
up
to
it
strictly
i
met
one
woman
who
assured
me
that
she
had
observed
it
faithfully
in
the
thirteen
years
since
her
youngest
child
was
born
she
had
such
a
loathing
for
sexual
union
however
that
it
was
doubtless
the
easiest
and
best
thing
for
her
to
do
loathing
disgust
or
indifference
to
the
sex
relationship
nearly
always
lies
behind
the
advocacy
to
continence
except
for
the
conscious
purpose
of
creating
children
in
other
words
while
one
in
ten
thousand
persons
may
find
full
play
for
a
diverted
and
transmuted
sex
force
in
other
creative
functions
the
rest
avoid
the
sex
union
from
repression
these
are
two
widely
different
situations
one
may
make
for
racial
progress
and
the
happiness
of
the
few
individuals
capable
of
it
the
other
poisons
the
race
at
its
fountain
and
brings
nothing
but
the
discontent
unhappiness
and
misery
which
follow
enforced
continence
for
all
that
an
increasing
number
of
persons
mostly
women
are
advocating
continence
within
marriage
sexual
union
is
nearly
always
spoken
of
by
such
persons
as
something
in
itself
repugnant
disgusting
low
and
lustful
consciously
or
unconsciously
they
look
upon
it
as
a
hardship
to
be
endured
only
to
bring
god
image
and
likeness
into
the
world
their
very
attitude
precludes
any
great
probability
that
their
progeny
will
possess
an
abundance
of
such
qualities
much
of
the
responsibility
for
this
feeling
upon
the
part
of
many
thousands
of
women
must
be
laid
to
two
thousand
years
of
christian
teaching
that
all
sex
expression
is
unclean
part
of
it
too
must
be
laid
to
the
dominant
male
habit
of
violating
the
love
rights
of
his
mate
the
habit
referred
to
grows
out
of
the
assumed
and
legalized
right
of
the
husband
to
have
sexual
satisfaction
at
any
time
he
desires
regardless
of
the
woman
repugnance
for
it
the
law
of
the
state
upholds
him
in
this
regard
a
husband
need
not
support
his
wife
if
she
refuses
to
comply
with
his
sexual
demands
of
the
two
groups
of
women
who
regard
physical
union
either
with
disgust
and
loathing
or
with
indifference
the
former
are
the
less
numerous
nevertheless
there
are
many
thousands
of
them
i
have
listened
to
their
stories
often
both
as
a
nurse
in
obstetrical
cases
and
as
a
propagandist
for
birth
control
an
almost
universal
cause
of
their
attitude
is
a
sad
lack
of
understanding
of
the
great
beauties
of
the
normal
idealistic
love
act
neither
do
they
understand
the
uplifting
power
of
such
unions
for
both
men
and
women
ignorance
of
life
ignorance
of
all
but
the
sheer
reproductive
function
of
mating
and
especially
a
wrong
training
are
most
largely
responsible
for
this
tragic
state
of
affairs
when
this
ignorance
extends
to
the
man
in
such
a
degree
as
to
permit
him
to
have
the
all
too
frequent
coarse
and
brutal
attitude
toward
sex
matters
the
tragedy
is
only
deepened
truly
the
church
and
those
moralists
who
have
been
insisting
upon
keeping
sex
matters
in
the
dark
have
a
huge
list
of
concealed
crimes
to
answer
for
the
right
kind
of
a
book
a
series
of
clear
scientific
lectures
or
a
talk
with
either
the
man
or
woman
will
often
do
away
with
most
of
the
repugnance
to
physical
union
when
the
repugnance
is
gone
the
way
is
open
to
that
upliftment
through
sex
idealism
which
is
the
birthright
of
all
women
and
men
when
i
have
had
the
confidence
of
women
indifferent
to
physical
union
i
have
found
the
fault
usually
lay
with
the
husband
his
idea
of
marriage
is
too
often
that
of
providing
a
home
for
a
female
who
would
in
turn
provide
for
his
physical
needs
including
sexual
satisfaction
such
a
husband
usually
excludes
such
satisfaction
from
the
category
of
the
wife
needs
physical
or
spiritual
this
man
is
not
concerned
with
his
wife
sex
urge
save
as
it
responds
to
his
own
at
times
of
his
choosing
man
code
has
taught
woman
to
be
quite
ashamed
of
such
desires
usually
she
speaks
of
indifference
without
regret
often
proudly
she
seems
to
regard
herself
as
more
chaste
and
highly
endowed
in
purity
than
other
women
who
confess
to
feeling
physical
attraction
toward
their
husbands
she
also
secretly
considers
herself
far
superior
to
the
husband
who
makes
no
concealment
of
his
desire
toward
her
nevertheless
because
of
this
desire
upon
the
husband
part
she
goes
on
pretending
to
mutual
interest
in
the
relationship
only
the
truth
plainly
spoken
can
help
these
people
the
woman
is
condemned
to
physical
mental
and
spiritual
misery
by
the
ignorance
which
society
has
fixed
upon
her
she
has
her
choice
between
an
enforced
continence
with
its
consequences
and
its
constant
aggravation
of
domestic
discord
and
the
sort
of
prostitution
legalized
by
the
marriage
ceremony
the
man
may
choose
between
enforced
continence
and
its
effects
or
he
may
resort
to
an
unmarried
relationship
or
to
prostitution
neither
of
these
people
the
one
schooled
directly
or
indirectly
by
the
church
and
the
other
trained
in
the
sex
ethics
of
the
gutter
can
hope
to
lift
the
other
to
the
regenerating
influences
of
a
pure
clean
happy
love
life
as
long
as
we
leave
sex
education
to
the
gutter
and
houses
of
prostitution
we
shall
have
millions
of
just
such
miserable
marriage
failures
such
continence
as
is
involved
in
dependence
upon
the
safe
period
for
family
limitation
will
harm
no
one
the
difficulty
here
is
that
the
method
is
not
practical
it
simply
does
not
work
the
woman
who
employs
this
method
finds
herself
in
the
same
predicament
as
the
one
who
believes
that
she
is
not
in
danger
of
pregnancy
when
she
does
not
respond
passionately
to
her
husband
that
this
woman
is
more
likely
to
conceive
than
the
emotional
one
is
a
fact
the
woman
who
refuses
to
use
contraceptives
but
who
rejects
sex
expression
except
for
a
few
days
in
the
month
is
likely
to
learn
too
soon
the
fallacy
of
her
theory
as
a
method
for
a
long
time
the
safe
period
was
suggested
by
physicians
it
was
also
the
one
method
of
birth
control
countenanced
by
the
ecclesiastics
women
are
learning
from
experience
and
specialists
are
discovering
by
investigation
that
the
safe
period
is
anything
but
safe
for
all
women
some
women
are
never
free
from
the
possibility
of
conception
from
puberty
to
the
menopause
others
seemingly
have
safe
periods
for
a
time
only
to
become
pregnant
when
they
have
begun
to
feel
secure
in
their
theory
here
again
continence
must
give
way
as
a
method
of
birth
control
to
contraceptives
in
the
same
category
as
the
safe
period
as
a
method
of
birth
control
must
be
placed
male
continence
the
same
practice
is
also
variously
known
as
karezza
sedular
absorption
and
zugassent
discovery
those
who
regard
it
as
a
method
of
family
limitation
are
likely
to
find
themselves
disappointed
as
a
form
of
continence
however
if
it
can
be
called
continence
it
is
asserted
to
bring
none
of
the
long
course
of
evils
which
too
often
follow
the
practice
of
lifelong
abstinence
or
abstinence
broken
only
when
a
child
is
desired
its
devotees
testify
that
they
avoid
ill
effects
and
achieve
the
highest
possible
results
these
results
are
due
probably
to
two
factors
first
those
who
practice
karezza
are
usually
of
a
high
mental
and
spiritual
development
and
are
therefore
capable
of
an
exalted
degree
of
without
actual
repression
second
they
have
the
benefit
of
that
magnetic
interchange
between
man
and
woman
which
makes
for
physical
mental
and
spiritual
wellbeing
this
stimulation
becomes
destructive
irritation
in
ordinary
forms
of
continence
the
oneida
community
a
religious
group
comprising
about
men
and
women
which
occupied
a
part
of
an
old
indian
reservation
in
the
state
of
new
york
were
the
chief
exponents
of
male
continence
the
practice
was
a
religious
requirement
with
them
and
they
laid
great
stress
upon
three
different
functions
which
they
attributed
to
the
sexual
organs
they
held
that
these
functions
were
urinary
reproductive
and
amative
each
separate
and
distinct
in
its
use
from
the
others
cases
are
cited
in
which
both
men
and
women
are
said
to
have
preserved
their
youth
and
their
sexual
powers
to
a
ripe
old
age
and
to
have
prolonged
their
honeymoons
throughout
married
life
the
theory
however
interesting
as
it
may
be
when
considered
as
continence
is
not
to
be
relied
upon
as
a
method
of
birth
control
summing
it
all
up
then
continence
may
meet
the
needs
of
a
few
natures
but
it
does
not
meet
the
needs
of
the
masses
to
enforce
continence
upon
those
whose
natures
do
not
demand
it
is
an
injustice
the
cruelty
and
the
danger
of
which
has
been
underestimated
rather
than
exaggerated
it
matters
not
whether
this
wrong
is
committed
by
the
church
through
some
outworn
dogma
by
the
state
through
the
laws
prohibiting
contraceptives
or
by
society
through
the
conditions
which
prevent
marriage
when
young
men
and
women
reach
the
age
at
which
they
have
need
of
marriage
the
world
has
been
governed
too
long
by
repression
the
more
fundamental
the
force
that
is
repressed
the
more
destructive
its
action
the
disastrous
effects
of
repressing
the
sex
force
are
written
plainly
in
the
health
rates
the
mortality
statistics
the
records
of
crime
and
the
entry
books
of
the
hospitals
for
the
insane
yet
this
is
not
all
the
tale
for
there
are
still
the
little
understood
hosts
of
sexually
abnormal
people
and
the
monotonous
misery
of
millions
who
do
not
die
early
nor
end
violently
but
who
are
nevertheless
devoid
of
the
joys
of
a
natural
love
life
as
a
means
of
birth
control
continence
is
as
impracticable
for
most
people
as
it
is
undesirable
celibate
women
doubtless
have
their
place
in
the
regeneration
of
the
world
but
it
is
not
they
after
all
who
will
through
experience
and
understanding
recreate
it
it
is
mainly
through
fullness
of
expression
and
experience
in
life
that
the
mass
of
women
having
attained
freedom
will
accomplish
this
unparalleled
task
the
need
of
women
lives
is
not
repression
but
the
greatest
possible
expression
and
fulfillment
of
their
desires
upon
the
highest
possible
plane
they
can
not
reach
higher
planes
through
ignorance
and
compulsion
they
can
attain
them
only
through
knowledge
and
the
cultivation
of
a
higher
happier
attitude
toward
sex
sex
life
must
be
stripped
of
its
fear
this
is
one
of
the
great
functions
of
contraceptives
that
which
is
enshrouded
in
fear
becomes
morbid
that
which
is
morbid
can
not
be
really
beautiful
a
true
understanding
of
every
phase
of
the
love
life
and
such
an
understanding
alone
can
reveal
it
in
its
purity
in
its
power
of
upliftment
force
and
fear
have
failed
from
the
beginning
of
time
their
fruits
are
wrecks
and
wretchedness
knowledge
and
freedom
to
choose
or
reject
the
sexual
embrace
according
as
it
is
lovely
or
unlovely
and
these
alone
can
solve
the
problem
these
alone
make
possible
between
man
and
woman
that
indissoluble
tie
and
mutual
passion
and
common
understanding
in
which
lies
the
hope
of
a
higher
race
chapter
x
contraceptives
or
abortion
society
has
not
yet
learned
the
significance
of
the
effort
of
the
feminine
spirit
to
free
itself
of
the
burden
of
excessive
childbearing
it
has
been
singularly
blind
to
the
real
forces
underlying
the
cause
of
infanticide
child
abandonment
and
abortion
it
has
permitted
the
highest
and
most
powerful
thing
in
woman
nature
to
be
hindered
diverted
repressed
and
confused
society
has
permitted
this
inner
urge
of
woman
to
be
rendered
violent
by
repression
until
it
has
expressed
itself
in
cruel
forms
of
family
limitation
which
this
same
society
has
promptly
labeled
crimes
and
sought
to
punish
it
has
gone
on
blindly
forcing
women
into
these
crimes
deaf
alike
to
their
entreaties
and
to
the
lessons
of
history
as
we
have
seen
in
the
second
chapter
of
this
book
child
abandonment
and
infanticide
are
by
no
means
obsolete
practices
as
for
abortion
it
has
not
decreased
but
increased
with
the
advance
of
civilization
the
reader
will
recall
that
one
authority
says
that
there
are
abortions
in
the
united
states
every
year
while
another
estimates
double
that
number
most
of
the
women
of
the
middle
and
upper
classes
in
america
seem
secure
in
their
knowledge
of
contraceptives
as
a
means
of
birth
control
under
present
conditions
when
the
laws
in
most
states
regard
this
knowledge
howsoever
it
be
imparted
as
illicit
and
the
federal
statutes
prohibit
the
sending
of
it
through
the
mails
even
the
women
in
more
fortunate
circumstances
sometimes
have
difficulty
in
getting
scientific
information
nevertheless
so
strong
is
their
purpose
that
they
do
obtain
it
and
use
it
correctly
or
incorrectly
the
great
majority
of
women
however
belong
to
the
working
class
nearly
all
of
these
women
will
fall
into
one
of
two
general
groups
the
ones
who
are
having
children
against
their
wills
and
those
who
to
escape
this
evil
find
refuge
in
abortion
being
given
their
choice
by
society
to
continue
to
be
overburdened
mothers
or
to
submit
to
a
humiliating
repulsive
painful
and
too
often
gravely
dangerous
operation
those
women
in
whom
the
feminine
urge
to
freedom
is
strongest
choose
the
abortionist
one
group
goes
on
bringing
children
to
birth
hoping
that
they
will
be
born
dead
or
die
the
women
of
the
other
group
strive
consciously
by
drastic
means
to
protect
themselves
and
the
children
already
born
our
examinations
says
max
hirsch
an
authority
on
the
subject
have
informed
us
that
the
largest
number
of
abortions
in
the
united
states
are
performed
on
married
women
this
fact
brings
us
to
the
conclusion
that
contraceptive
measures
among
the
upper
classes
and
the
practice
of
abortion
among
the
lower
class
are
the
real
means
employed
to
regulate
the
number
of
offspring
thus
a
high
percentage
of
women
in
comfortable
circumstances
escape
overbreeding
by
the
use
of
contraceptives
a
similarly
high
percentage
of
women
not
in
comfortable
circumstances
are
forced
to
submit
to
forced
maternity
because
their
only
alternative
at
present
is
abortion
when
accidental
conception
takes
place
some
women
of
both
classes
resort
to
abortion
if
they
can
obtain
the
services
of
an
abortionist
when
society
holds
up
its
hands
in
horror
at
the
crime
of
abortion
it
forgets
at
whose
door
the
first
and
principal
responsibility
for
this
practice
rests
does
anyone
imagine
that
a
woman
would
submit
to
abortion
if
not
denied
the
knowledge
of
scientific
effective
contraceptives
does
anyone
believe
that
physicians
and
midwives
who
perform
abortions
go
from
door
to
door
soliciting
patronage
the
abortionist
could
not
continue
his
practice
for
hours
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
women
come
desperately
begging
for
such
operations
he
could
not
stay
out
of
jail
a
day
if
women
did
not
so
generally
approve
of
his
services
as
to
hold
his
identity
an
open
but
secret
the
question
then
is
not
whether
family
limitation
should
be
practiced
it
being
practiced
it
has
been
practiced
for
ages
and
it
will
always
be
practiced
the
question
that
society
must
answer
is
this
shall
family
limitation
be
achieved
through
birth
control
or
abortion
shall
normal
safe
effective
contraceptives
be
employed
or
shall
we
continue
to
force
women
to
the
abnormal
often
dangerous
surgical
operation
this
question
too
the
church
the
state
and
the
moralist
must
answer
the
knowledge
of
contraceptive
methods
may
yet
for
a
time
be
denied
to
the
woman
of
the
working
class
but
those
who
are
responsible
for
denying
it
to
her
and
she
herself
should
understand
clearly
the
dangers
to
which
she
is
exposed
because
of
the
laws
which
force
her
into
the
hands
of
the
abortionist
to
understand
the
more
clearly
the
difference
between
birth
control
by
contraceptives
and
family
limitation
through
abortion
it
is
necessary
to
know
something
of
the
processes
of
conception
knowledge
of
these
processes
will
also
enable
us
to
comprehend
more
thoroughly
the
dangers
to
which
woman
is
exposed
by
our
antiquated
laws
and
how
much
better
it
would
be
for
her
to
employ
such
preventive
measures
as
would
keep
her
out
of
the
hands
of
the
abortionist
into
which
the
laws
now
drive
her
in
every
woman
ovaries
are
imbedded
millions
of
ovules
or
eggs
they
are
in
every
female
at
birth
and
as
the
girl
develops
into
womanhood
these
ovules
develop
also
at
a
certain
age
varying
slightly
with
the
individual
the
ripest
ovule
leaves
the
nest
or
ovary
and
comes
down
one
of
the
tubes
connecting
with
the
womb
and
passes
out
of
the
body
when
this
takes
place
it
is
said
that
the
girl
is
at
the
age
of
puberty
when
it
reaches
the
womb
the
ovule
is
ready
for
the
process
of
conception
that
is
fertilization
by
the
male
sperm
at
the
time
the
ovule
is
ripening
the
womb
is
preparing
to
receive
it
this
preparation
consists
of
a
reinforced
blood
supply
brought
to
its
lining
if
fertilization
takes
place
the
fertilized
ovule
or
ovum
will
cling
to
the
lining
of
the
womb
and
there
gather
its
nourishment
if
fertilization
does
not
take
place
the
ovum
passes
out
of
the
body
and
the
uterus
throws
off
its
surplus
blood
supply
this
is
called
the
menstrual
period
it
occurs
about
once
a
month
or
every
days
in
the
male
organs
there
are
glands
called
testes
they
secrete
a
fluid
called
the
semen
in
the
semen
is
the
principle
called
the
sperm
when
intercourse
takes
place
if
no
preventive
is
employed
the
semen
is
deposited
in
the
woman
vagina
the
ovule
is
not
in
the
vagina
but
is
in
the
womb
farther
up
or
perhaps
in
the
tube
on
its
way
to
the
womb
as
steel
is
attracted
to
the
magnet
the
sperm
of
the
male
starts
on
its
way
to
seek
the
ovum
several
of
these
sperm
cells
start
but
only
one
enters
the
ovum
and
is
absorbed
into
it
this
process
is
called
fertilization
conception
or
impregnation
if
no
children
are
desired
the
meeting
of
the
male
sperm
and
the
ovum
must
be
prevented
when
scientific
means
are
employed
to
prevent
this
meeting
one
is
said
to
practice
birth
control
the
means
used
is
known
as
a
contraceptive
if
however
a
contraceptive
is
not
used
and
the
sperm
meets
the
ovule
and
development
begins
any
attempt
at
removing
it
or
stopping
its
further
growth
is
called
abortion
there
is
no
doubt
that
women
are
apt
to
look
upon
abortion
as
of
little
consequence
and
to
treat
it
accordingly
an
abortion
is
as
important
a
matter
as
a
confinement
and
requires
as
much
attention
as
the
birth
of
a
child
at
its
full
term
the
immediate
dangers
of
abortion
says
clifton
edgar
in
his
book
practice
of
are
hemorrhage
retention
of
an
adherent
placenta
sepsis
tetanus
perforation
of
the
uterus
they
also
cause
sterility
anemia
malignant
diseases
displacements
neurosis
and
endometritis
in
plain
everyday
language
in
an
abortion
there
is
always
a
very
serious
risk
to
the
health
and
often
to
the
life
of
the
patient
it
is
only
the
women
of
wealth
who
can
afford
the
best
medical
skill
care
and
treatment
both
at
the
time
of
the
operation
and
afterwards
in
this
way
they
escape
the
usual
serious
consequences
the
women
whose
incomes
are
limited
and
who
must
continue
at
work
before
they
have
recovered
from
the
effects
of
an
abortion
are
the
great
army
of
sufferers
it
is
among
such
that
the
deaths
due
to
abortion
usually
ensue
it
is
these
too
who
are
most
often
forced
to
resort
to
such
operations
if
death
does
not
result
the
woman
who
has
undergone
an
abortion
is
not
altogether
safe
from
harm
the
womb
may
not
return
to
its
natural
size
but
remain
large
and
heavy
tending
to
fall
away
from
its
natural
position
abortion
often
leaves
the
uterus
in
a
condition
to
conceive
easily
again
and
unless
prevention
is
strictly
followed
another
pregnancy
will
surely
occur
frequent
abortions
tend
to
cause
barrenness
and
serious
painful
pelvic
ailments
these
and
other
conditions
arising
from
such
operations
are
very
likely
to
ruin
a
woman
general
health
while
there
are
cases
where
even
the
law
recognizes
an
abortion
as
justifiable
if
recommended
by
a
physician
i
assert
that
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
abortions
performed
in
america
each
year
are
a
disgrace
to
civilization
the
effects
of
such
operations
upon
a
woman
serious
as
they
may
be
are
nothing
as
compared
to
the
injury
done
her
general
health
by
drugs
taken
to
produce
the
same
result
even
such
drugs
as
are
prescribed
by
physicians
have
harmful
effects
and
nostrums
recommended
by
druggists
are
often
worse
still
even
more
drastic
may
be
the
effect
upon
the
unborn
child
for
many
women
fill
their
systems
with
poisonous
drugs
during
the
first
weeks
of
their
pregnancy
only
to
decide
at
last
when
drugs
have
failed
as
they
usually
do
to
bring
the
child
to
birth
there
are
no
statistics
of
course
by
which
we
may
compute
the
amount
of
suffering
to
mother
and
child
from
the
use
of
such
drugs
but
we
know
that
the
total
of
physical
weakness
and
disease
must
be
astounding
we
know
that
the
woman
own
system
feels
the
strain
of
these
drugs
and
that
the
embryo
is
usually
poisoned
by
them
the
child
is
likely
to
be
rickety
have
heart
trouble
kidney
disorder
or
to
be
generally
weak
in
its
powers
of
resistance
if
it
does
not
die
before
it
reaches
its
first
year
it
is
probable
that
it
will
have
to
struggle
against
some
of
these
weaknesses
until
its
adolescent
period
it
needs
no
assertion
of
mine
to
call
attention
to
the
grim
fact
that
the
laws
prohibiting
the
imparting
of
information
concerning
the
preventing
of
conception
are
responsible
for
tens
of
thousands
of
deaths
each
year
in
this
country
and
an
untold
amount
of
sickness
and
sorrow
the
suffering
and
the
death
of
these
women
is
squarely
upon
the
heads
of
the
lawmakers
and
the
puritanical
person
who
insist
upon
retaining
the
abominable
legal
restrictions
try
as
they
will
they
can
not
escape
the
truth
nor
hide
it
under
the
cloak
of
stupid
hypocrisy
if
the
laws
against
imparting
knowledge
of
scientific
birth
control
were
repealed
nearly
all
of
the
or
women
who
undergo
abortions
in
the
united
states
each
year
would
escape
the
agony
of
the
surgeon
instruments
and
the
long
trail
of
disease
suffering
and
death
which
so
often
follows
he
who
would
combat
abortion
says
hirsch
and
at
the
same
time
combat
contraceptive
measures
may
be
likened
to
the
person
who
would
fight
contagious
diseases
and
forbid
disinfection
for
contraceptive
measures
are
important
weapons
in
the
fight
against
abortion
america
has
a
law
since
which
prohibits
by
criminal
statute
the
distribution
and
regulation
of
contraceptive
measures
it
follows
therefore
that
america
stands
at
the
head
of
all
nations
in
the
huge
number
of
abortions
there
is
the
case
in
a
nutshell
family
limitation
will
always
be
practiced
as
it
is
now
being
practiced
either
by
birth
control
or
by
abortion
we
know
that
the
one
means
health
and
happiness
a
stronger
better
race
the
other
means
disease
suffering
death
the
woman
who
goes
to
the
abortionist
table
is
not
a
criminal
but
a
martyr
a
martyr
to
the
bitter
unthinkable
conditions
brought
about
by
the
blindness
of
society
at
large
these
conditions
give
her
the
choice
between
the
surgeon
instruments
and
the
sacrificing
of
what
is
highest
and
holiest
in
her
her
aspiration
to
freedom
her
desire
to
protect
the
children
already
hers
these
conditions
not
the
woman
outface
society
with
this
question
contraceptives
or
abortion
which
shall
it
be
chapter
xi
are
preventive
means
certain
there
are
several
means
of
preventing
conception
which
are
both
certain
and
harmless
what
those
means
are
the
state
laws
forbid
me
to
say
if
i
should
defy
the
state
laws
and
name
those
contraceptives
the
federal
laws
would
forbid
this
book
going
through
the
mails
nor
can
i
without
coming
into
conflict
with
the
laws
tell
these
means
are
reliable
it
is
difficult
to
discuss
the
subject
without
using
franker
language
than
the
statutes
permit
and
i
do
not
wish
to
violate
the
law
in
this
particular
book
can
i
rely
upon
this
is
it
certain
will
it
prevent
absolutely
such
questions
always
asked
by
women
who
seek
advice
concerning
contraceptives
testify
both
to
their
fear
of
involuntary
motherhood
and
their
doubt
as
to
any
and
all
means
offered
for
their
deliverance
doubt
as
to
the
certainty
of
contraceptives
arises
from
two
sources
one
is
the
uninformed
element
in
the
medical
profession
a
physician
who
belongs
to
this
element
may
object
to
birth
control
upon
general
grounds
or
he
may
repeat
objections
to
cover
his
ignorance
of
contraceptives
for
strange
as
it
may
seem
there
is
an
amazing
ignorance
among
physicians
of
this
supremely
important
subject
the
uninformed
objector
often
assumes
to
speak
with
the
voice
of
authority
asserting
that
there
are
no
thoroughly
dependable
contraceptives
that
are
not
injurious
to
the
user
the
other
source
of
distrust
is
the
experience
of
the
woman
herself
having
no
place
to
go
for
scientific
advice
she
gathers
her
information
from
neighbors
and
friends
one
offers
this
suggestion
another
offers
that
each
urging
the
means
that
she
has
found
successful
and
condemning
others
all
this
is
very
confusing
and
extremely
disturbing
to
the
woman
who
for
one
reason
or
another
is
living
in
constant
fear
of
pregnancy
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
that
such
a
state
of
affairs
exists
there
has
been
so
much
secrecy
about
the
whole
subject
and
so
much
dependence
upon
amateurish
and
nonprofessional
advice
that
it
is
almost
impossible
for
anyone
to
procure
reliable
information
or
to
recognize
it
when
given
this
is
especially
true
in
the
united
states
where
there
are
both
federal
and
state
laws
to
punish
those
who
disseminate
knowledge
of
methods
even
under
present
conditions
however
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
reliable
information
concerning
methods
of
birth
control
we
know
that
there
are
several
methods
of
prevention
which
are
not
only
dependable
but
which
can
be
used
without
injury
either
to
the
man
or
the
woman
knowledge
of
what
these
methods
are
and
how
to
apply
them
should
be
available
to
every
married
man
and
woman
it
is
safe
to
predict
that
in
a
very
few
years
they
will
be
available
some
methods
are
more
dependable
than
others
just
as
there
are
some
more
simple
of
adjustment
than
others
some
are
cheap
and
less
durable
others
are
expensive
and
last
for
years
there
are
some
which
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
have
stood
the
test
of
certainty
in
holland
france
england
and
the
united
states
among
the
wealthier
classes
as
the
falling
birth
rate
among
these
classes
indicates
and
just
as
the
reliable
primitive
wheelbarrow
is
antiquated
beside
the
latest
airplane
so
as
scientific
investigators
turn
their
attention
more
and
more
to
this
field
will
the
awkward
troublesome
methods
of
the
past
give
way
to
the
simpler
more
convenient
methods
of
the
morrow
although
the
law
forbids
information
concerning
reliable
means
of
contraception
it
is
hardly
likely
that
it
can
be
invoked
to
prevent
warnings
against
widely
practiced
methods
which
are
not
reliable
the
employment
of
such
methods
leads
not
only
to
disappointment
but
often
to
ill
health
one
of
the
most
common
practices
of
this
kind
is
that
of
nursing
one
baby
too
long
in
the
hope
of
preventing
the
birth
of
the
next
the
poor
whites
of
the
south
and
many
of
the
women
of
the
united
states
pin
their
hopes
to
this
method
often
they
persist
in
nursing
a
child
until
it
is
eighteen
months
old
almost
always
until
they
become
pregnant
again
prolonged
nursing
hurts
both
child
and
mother
it
is
said
in
the
child
it
causes
a
tendency
to
brain
disease
probably
through
disordered
digestion
and
nutrition
in
the
mother
it
causes
a
strong
tendency
to
deafness
and
blindness
if
a
child
is
nursed
after
it
is
twelve
months
old
it
is
generally
pale
flabby
and
unhealthy
often
rickety
one
authority
points
out
while
the
mother
is
usually
nervous
emaciated
and
hysterical
if
pregnancy
occurs
under
these
conditions
the
mother
not
only
injures
her
own
health
but
that
of
the
next
child
often
developing
in
it
a
weakness
of
constitution
which
it
never
overcomes
moreover
prolonged
nursing
has
been
found
to
be
unreliable
as
a
contraceptive
we
know
this
upon
good
authority
it
should
not
be
depended
upon
at
all
in
the
same
class
is
the
safe
period
referred
to
in
another
chapter
for
many
women
there
is
never
any
safe
period
others
have
safe
periods
for
a
number
of
years
only
to
find
themselves
pregnant
because
these
periods
have
ceased
without
warning
one
of
the
most
frequent
of
all
the
mistakes
made
in
recommending
contraceptives
is
the
advice
to
use
an
antiseptic
or
douche
this
error
seems
to
be
surprisingly
persistent
i
am
particularly
surprised
to
hear
from
women
that
such
douches
have
been
prescribed
by
physicians
any
physician
who
knows
the
first
rudiments
of
physiology
and
anatomy
must
also
know
that
necessary
and
important
as
an
antiseptic
douche
is
as
a
cleanser
and
hygienic
measure
it
is
assuredly
not
to
be
advised
as
a
means
of
preventing
conception
a
woman
may
and
often
does
become
pregnant
before
she
can
make
use
of
a
douche
this
is
particularly
likely
to
happen
if
her
uterus
is
low
and
the
woman
who
does
much
walking
who
stands
for
long
hours
or
who
uses
the
sewing
machine
a
great
deal
is
likely
to
have
a
low
uterus
it
is
then
much
easier
for
the
spermatazoa
to
enter
almost
directly
into
the
womb
than
it
would
otherwise
be
and
the
douche
no
matter
how
soon
it
is
used
is
likely
to
be
ineffective
the
tendency
of
the
uterus
to
drop
under
strain
goes
far
to
explain
why
some
women
who
have
depended
upon
the
douche
for
years
suddenly
find
themselves
pregnant
do
not
depend
upon
the
douche
as
a
cleansing
agent
it
is
a
necessary
part
of
every
woman
toilet
but
it
is
not
a
preventive
even
if
the
douche
were
dependable
the
absence
of
sanitary
convenience
from
households
in
remote
districts
and
the
difficulty
of
using
a
douche
in
crowded
tenements
would
prevent
many
women
from
making
use
of
it
despite
the
unreliability
of
some
methods
and
the
harmfulness
of
some
others
there
methods
which
are
both
harmless
and
certain
this
much
the
woman
who
is
seeking
means
of
limiting
her
family
may
be
told
here
using
any
whatsoever
all
depends
upon
the
care
taken
to
use
it
properly
no
surgeon
no
matter
how
perfect
his
instruments
would
expect
perfect
results
from
the
simplest
operation
did
he
not
exercise
the
greatest
possible
care
common
sense
good
judgment
and
taking
pains
are
necessary
in
the
use
of
all
contraceptives
more
and
more
perfect
means
of
preventing
conception
will
be
developed
as
women
insist
upon
them
every
woman
should
make
it
plain
to
her
physician
that
she
expects
him
to
be
informed
upon
this
subject
she
should
refuse
to
accept
evasive
answers
an
increasing
demand
upon
physicians
will
inevitably
result
in
laboratory
researches
and
experimentation
such
investigation
is
indeed
already
beginning
and
we
may
expect
great
progress
in
contraceptive
methods
in
the
near
future
we
may
also
expect
more
authoritative
opinions
upon
preventive
methods
and
devices
when
women
confidently
and
insistently
demand
them
they
will
have
access
to
contraceptives
which
are
both
certain
and
harmless
chapter

will
birth
control
help
the
cause
of
labor
labor
seems
instinctively
to
have
recognized
the
fact
that
its
servitude
springs
from
numbers
seldom
however
has
it
applied
its
knowledge
logically
and
thoroughly
the
basic
principle
of
craft
unionism
is
limitation
of
the
number
of
workers
in
a
given
trade
this
has
been
labor
most
frequent
expedient
for
righting
its
wrongs
every
unionist
knows
as
a
matter
of
course
that
if
that
number
is
kept
small
enough
his
organization
can
compel
increases
of
wages
steady
employment
and
decent
working
conditions
craft
unionism
has
succeeded
in
attaining
these
insofar
as
it
has
been
able
to
apply
this
principle
it
has
failed
insofar
as
it
has
been
unable
to
apply
it
the
weakness
of
craft
unionism
is
that
it
does
not
carry
its
principle
far
enough
it
applies
its
policy
of
limitation
of
numbers
only
to
the
trade
in
his
home
the
worker
whether
he
is
a
unionist
or
goes
on
producing
large
numbers
of
children
to
compete
with
him
eventually
in
the
labor
market
the
history
of
labor
says
teresa
in
the
sense
of
the
population
is
the
history
of
an
ever
unsuccessful
effort
upon
the
part
of
man
to
bring
his
productive
ability
as
a
worker
up
to
his
reproductive
ability
it
has
been
a
losing
battle
all
the
way
the
small
percentage
of
highly
skilled
organized
workers
lead
in
the
struggle
for
better
conditions
craft
unions
by
limiting
the
number
of
men
available
for
any
one
trade
manage
to
procure
better
pay
shorter
hours
and
other
advantages
for
their
members
disaster
in
the
form
of
famine
pestilence
tidal
waves
earthquakes
or
war
sometimes
limits
the
number
of
available
workers
then
those
who
live
in
parts
of
the
world
that
are
not
affected
or
who
stay
at
home
during
wars
reap
a
temporary
advantage
these
advantages
however
are
quickly
offset
by
increased
prices
or
by
competition
for
jobs
when
soldiers
return
from
war
this
form
of
limitation
of
numbers
works
to
the
advantage
of
labor
as
long
as
it
is
available
but
great
disasters
are
not
constantly
in
operation
while
the
reproductive
ability
is
so
in
a
few
years
they
have
lost
what
nature
destructiveness
won
for
them
the
great
mass
of
the
workers
including
children
and
women
are
unskilled
and
unorganized
not
only
that
they
are
for
some
considerable
part
of
the
time
seeking
employment
they
are
of
course
poorly
paid
thus
through
their
low
wages
and
their
seeking
of
employment
they
always
come
into
direct
competition
with
one
another
and
with
the
skilled
and
organized
workmen
as
their
families
live
in
want
and
are
often
diseased
they
create
the
chief
social
problems
of
the
day
they
bring
children
into
the
world
as
fast
as
women
can
bear
them
with
each
child
they
increase
their
own
misery
and
provide
another
worker
to
force
down
wages
and
prolong
hours
through
competition
for
employment
this
has
been
the
way
of
labor
from
the
beginning
it
is
labor
way
in
every
country
having
discovered
that
there
is
no
relief
in
legislation
labor
organizes
to
limit
its
numbers
in
certain
trades
meanwhile
the
women
of
the
working
class
go
on
breeding
more
workers
to
wipe
out
in
the
future
the
advantages
gained
for
the
present
in
paris
for
instance
the
proletarian
quarters
of
the
city
show
a
birth
rate
more
than
three
times
as
high
as
the
birth
rate
in
the
sections
jacques
bartillon
furnishes
us
with
statistics
which
prove
that
the
birth
rate
in
any
quarter
of
paris
is
in
inverse
ratio
to
its
degree
of
affluence
says
hardy
in
to
prevent
the
rich
has
a
birth
rate
a
third
of
that
bellerville
or
of
the
from
women
from
the
age
of
fifteen
to
fifty
menimontant
gives
births
the
births
it
is
the
same
in
berlin
for
women
from
the
age
of
fifteen
to
that
of
fifty
a
very
poor
quarter
gives
births
a
rich
quarter
gives
births
and
so
it
is
the
world
over
the
very
word
proletarian
as
hardy
points
out
means
producer
of
children
the
children
thus
carelessly
produced
undermine
the
health
of
the
mother
deepen
the
family
poverty
destroy
the
happiness
of
the
home
and
dishearten
the
father
all
this
in
addition
to
being
future
competitors
in
the
labor
market
too
often
their
increasing
number
drives
the
mother
herself
into
industry
where
her
beggarly
wages
tend
to
lower
the
level
of
those
of
her
husband
the
first
sickening
feature
of
this
general
situation
is
the
high
infant
mortality
among
the
children
of
the
workers
many
children
come
merely
to
sap
the
strength
of
the
mother
suffer
and
die
leaving
to
show
for
their
coming
and
going
only
an
increased
burden
of
sorrow
and
debt
the
lower
the
family
income
the
more
of
these
babies
die
before
they
are
a
year
old
a
survey
of
infant
mortality
in
johnstown
by
the
federal
children
bureau
gave
these
typical
results
for
the
year
infant
mortality
father
earnings
rate
under
to
to
to
to
or
over
ample
these
figures
do
not
represent
the
total
income
of
all
families
neither
will
money
buy
as
much
in
as
it
did
in
seventy
per
cent
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
incomes
of
less
than
this
means
that
from
to
children
born
into
such
families
die
before
they
are
one
year
old
the
births
and
deaths
of
these
children
represent
just
so
much
useless
burden
of
anguish
and
sorrow
to
the
workers
despite
this
high
infant
death
rate
the
workers
of
the
united
states
still
have
more
children
than
they
can
care
for
there
are
enough
of
them
left
over
to
provide
child
laborers
who
by
working
for
a
pittance
crowd
their
parents
out
of
employment
and
force
the
families
deeper
into
poverty
when
all
is
said
and
done
the
workers
who
produce
large
families
have
themselves
to
blame
for
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
unemployed
grasping
for
jobs
for
the
strike
breakers
for
the
policemen
who
beat
up
and
arrest
strikers
and
for
the
soldiers
who
shoot
strikers
down
all
these
come
from
the
families
of
workingmen
their
fathers
and
mothers
are
workers
for
wages
out
of
the
loins
of
labor
they
come
into
the
world
and
compel
surplus
labor
to
betray
labor
that
is
employed
nor
is
this
all
when
a
workman
of
superior
strength
and
skill
protected
by
his
union
manages
to
maintain
a
large
or
moderate
sized
family
in
a
degree
of
comfort
there
always
comes
a
time
when
he
must
strike
to
preserve
what
he
has
won
if
he
is
not
beaten
by
unorganized
workers
who
seek
his
job
he
still
has
to
face
the
possibility
of
listening
to
the
cries
of
several
hungry
children
if
the
strike
is
a
long
one
these
cries
often
down
the
promptings
of
loyalty
and
class
interest
often
they
defeat
him
when
nothing
else
could
is
it
any
wonder
that
under
handicaps
like
these
labor
becomes
confused
and
flounders
it
has
been
offered
a
multitude
of
remedies
political
reforms
wage
legislation
statutory
regulation
of
hours
and
so
on
it
has
been
invited
to
embrace
craft
and
industrial
unionism
syndicalism
anarchism
socialism
as
panaceas
for
its
liberation
except
in
a
few
countries
it
has
not
attained
to
aggressive
power
but
has
been
a
tool
for
unscrupulous
politicians
even
with
the
temporary
advantages
gained
by
the
wiping
out
of
millions
of
workers
in
the
great
war
labor
problem
remains
unsolved
it
has
now
as
always
to
contend
with
the
crop
of
young
laborers
coming
into
the
market
and
with
the
machine
which
instead
of
relieving
the
worker
situation
makes
it
all
the
harder
for
him
to
escape
fewer
laborers
are
needed
for
a
given
amount
of
production
and
distribution
than
before
the
invention
of
these
machines
yet
owing
to
the
increase
in
the
number
of
the
workers
labor
finds
itself
enslaved
instead
of
liberated
by
the
machine
hitherto
says
john
stuart
mill
it
is
questionable
if
all
the
mechanical
inventions
yet
made
have
lightened
the
day
toil
of
any
human
being
they
have
enabled
a
greater
population
to
live
the
same
life
of
drudgery
and
imprisonment
and
an
increased
number
of
manufacturers
and
others
to
make
fortunes
that
in
a
few
words
sums
up
the
greater
part
of
labor
progress
we
blame
capitalism
and
its
wasteful
brutal
industrial
system
for
all
our
social
problems
but
our
numbers
were
vast
and
our
bondage
grievous
before
modern
industry
came
into
existence
we
may
curse
the
trusts
but
our
subjection
was
accomplished
before
the
trusts
had
emerged
from
the
brain
of
evolution
we
may
blame
public
officials
and
individual
employers
but
our
burdens
were
crushing
before
these
were
born
we
look
now
here
now
there
for
the
cause
of
our
condition
everywhere
but
at
the
one
to
blame
we
fight
again
and
again
for
our
rights
only
to
be
conquered
by
our
own
kind
our
own
children
our
brother
our
neighbor
let
us
carry
to
its
logical
conclusion
the
principle
of
limitation
which
has
been
partially
applied
by
labor
unions
the
way
to
get
rid
of
labor
problems
unemployment
low
wages
the
surplus
unwanted
population
is
to
stop
breeding
they
come
from
our
own
ranks
from
our
own
families
the
way
to
get
better
wages
shorter
hours
a
new
system
for
the
advancement
of
labor
is
to
make
labor
numbers
fewer
let
us
not
wait
for
war
famine
and
plague
to
do
it
let
us
cease
bringing
unwanted
children
into
the
world
to
suffer
a
while
add
to
our
burdens
and
die
let
us
cease
bringing
others
into
the
world
to
compete
with
us
for
a
living
let
the
women
workers
practice
birth
control
what
are
the
concrete
things
which
the
worker
can
gain
at
once
through
birth
control
first
a
small
family
can
live
much
better
than
a
large
one
upon
the
wages
now
received
workers
could
be
better
fed
clothed
and
educated
again
fewer
children
in
the
families
of
the
workers
would
tend
to
check
the
rise
in
the
prices
of
food
which
are
forced
up
as
the
demand
increases
within
a
few
years
it
would
reduce
the
number
of
workers
competing
for
jobs
the
worker
could
the
more
easily
force
society
to
give
him
more
of
the
product
of
his
labor
or
all
of
it
and
while
these
things
are
taking
place
the
slums
with
their
disease
their
moral
degradation
and
all
their
sordid
accompaniments
would
automatically
disappear
no
worker
would
need
to
live
in
such
tenements
hence
they
would
be
modernized
or
torn
down
at
the
same
time
the
few
children
that
were
being
born
to
the
workers
would
be
stronger
healthier
more
courageous
they
would
be
fit
human
beings
not
miserable
victims
of
murderous
conditions
birth
control
does
not
propose
to
replace
any
of
the
idealistic
movements
and
philosophies
of
the
workers
it
is
not
a
substitute
it
precedes
it
is
of
itself
a
principle
that
lifts
the
heaviest
of
the
burdens
that
afflict
labor
it
can
and
it
must
be
the
foundation
upon
which
any
permanently
successful
improvement
in
conditions
is
attained
it
is
therefore
a
necessary
prelude
in
all
effective
propaganda
a
few
years
of
systematic
agitation
for
birth
control
would
put
labor
in
a
position
to
solve
all
its
problems
labor
organized
or
unorganized
must
take
heed
of
this
fact
groups
and
parties
working
for
a
new
social
order
must
include
it
in
their
programmes
no
social
system
no
workers
democracy
no
socialist
republic
can
operate
successfully
and
maintain
its
ideals
unless
the
practice
of
birth
control
is
encouraged
to
a
marked
and
efficient
degree
in

i
saw
a
bull
fight
it
was
in
the
great
arena
at
barcelona
as
bull
after
bull
went
down
his
magnificent
defeated
strength
bleeding
away
through
wounds
inflicted
by
his
weak
but
skillful
assailant
i
thought
of
the
world
of
workers
and
their
oppressors
as
each
bull
was
sent
into
the
arena
he
was
confronted
by
one
assailant
and
twenty
there
was
but
one
enemy
for
him
to
face
but
there
were
twenty
brilliant
flags
each
of
a
different
color
to
distract
his
attention
from
the
man
who
held
the
weapon
no
sooner
was
his
real
antagonist
in
danger
than
one
of
the
confusers
fluttered
a
flag
before
his
eyes
with
one
toss
of
his
horns
he
could
have
ripped
the
life
from
the
toreador
but
his
confusers
were
always
there
with
the
flags
one
after
another
he
charged
them
only
to
spend
the
force
of
his
lunges
in
the
empty
air
he
found
that
as
he
was
about
to
toss
one
of
his
confusers
into
the
air
he
was
confronted
by
another
flag
which
he
charged
with
equal
futility
finally
utterly
bewildered
and
exhausted
too
spiritless
to
meet
the
attack
he
falls
under
the
sword
thrust
of
the
toreador
and
the
sun
shines
in
the
deep
blue
overhead
the
band
plays
the
ten
thousand
spectators
shout
while
the
victim
is
dragged
out
to
make
room
for
another
it
is
the
drama
of
labor
it
will
be
the
drama
of
labor
until
labor
finds
its
real
enemy
that
enemy
is
the
reproductive
ability
of
the
working
class
which
gluts
the
channels
of
progress
with
the
helpless
and
weak
and
stimulates
the
tyrants
of
the
world
in
their
oppression

chapter
xiii
battalions
of
unwanted
babies
the
cause
of
war
in
every
nation
of
militaristic
tendencies
we
find
the
reactionaries
demanding
a
higher
and
still
higher
birth
rate
their
plea
is
first
that
great
armies
are
needed
to
defend
the
country
from
its
possible
enemies
second
that
a
huge
population
is
required
to
assure
the
country
its
proper
place
among
the
powers
of
the
world
at
bottom
the
two
pleas
are
the
same
as
soon
as
the
country
becomes
overpopulated
these
reactionaries
proclaim
loudly
its
moral
right
to
expand
they
point
to
the
huge
population
which
in
the
name
of
patriotism
they
have
previously
demanded
should
be
brought
into
being
again
pleading
patriotism
they
declare
that
it
is
the
moral
right
of
the
nation
to
take
by
force
such
room
as
it
needs
then
comes
war
usually
against
some
nation
supposed
to
be
less
well
prepared
than
the
aggressor
diplomats
make
it
their
business
to
conceal
the
facts
and
politicians
violently
denounce
the
politicians
of
other
countries
there
is
a
long
beating
of
by
the
press
and
all
other
agencies
for
influencing
public
opinion
facts
are
distorted
and
lies
invented
until
the
common
people
can
not
get
at
the
truth
yet
when
the
war
is
over
if
not
before
we
always
find
that
a
place
in
the
sun
a
path
to
the
sea
a
route
to
india
or
something
of
the
sort
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
trouble
these
are
merely
other
names
for
expansion
the
need
of
expansion
is
only
another
name
for
overpopulation
one
supreme
example
is
sufficient
to
drive
home
this
truth
that
the
great
war
from
the
horror
of
which
we
are
just
beginning
to
emerge
had
its
source
in
overpopulation
is
too
evident
to
be
denied
by
any
serious
student
of
current
history
for
the
past
one
hundred
years
most
of
the
nations
of
europe
have
been
piling
up
terrific
debts
to
humanity
by
the
encouragement
of
unlimited
numbers
the
rulers
of
these
nations
and
their
militarists
have
constantly
called
upon
the
people
to
breed
breed

large
populations
meant
more
people
to
produce
wealth
more
people
to
pay
taxes
more
trade
for
the
merchants
more
soldiers
to
protect
the
wealth
but
more
people
also
meant
need
of
greater
food
supplies
an
urgent
and
natural
need
for
expansion
as
shown
by
drysdale
famous
war
map
of
europe
the
great
conflict
began
among
the
high
birth

germany
with
its

the

informed
through
the
publication
of
secret
treaties
by
the
soviet
government
of
russia
upon
the
promise
of

held
by
austria
england

to
her
small

area

is
conspicuous
for
her
low

stood
in
the
way
of
expansion
of
high

germany
nearly
all
of
the
persistently
neutral
countries
holland
denmark
norway
sweden
and
switzerland
have
low
birth
rates
the
average
being
a
little
over
owing
to
the
part
germany
played
in
the
war
a
survey
of
her
birth
statistics
is
decidedly
illuminating
the
increase
in
the
german
birth
rate
up
to
was
great
though
it
began
to
decline
then
the
decline
was
not
sufficient
to
offset
the
tremendous
increase
of
the
previous
years
there
were
more
millions
to
produce
children
so
while
the
average
number
of
births
per
thousand
was
somewhat
smaller
the
net
increase
in
population
was
still
huge
from
in
the
year
the
empire
was
founded
the
german
population
grew
to
approximately
in
meanwhile
her
food
supply
increased
only
a
very
small
per
cent
in
russia
had
a
birth
rate
even
higher
than
germany
had
ever
been
a
little
less
than
per
thousand
when
czarist
russia
wanted
an
outlet
to
the
mediterranean
by
way
of
constantinople
she
was
thinking
of
her
increasing
population
germany
was
thinking
of
her
increasing
population
when
she
spoke
as
with
one
voice
of
a
place
in
the
sun
for
some
decades
said
the
royal
prussian
journal
in
an
article
quoted
by
the
malthusian
london
of
april
the
great
growth
of
german
population
has
been
almost
entirely
forced
into
the
towns
since
of
the
four
millions
of
increase
in
five
years
only
a
few
can
find
places
in
agriculture
as
most
properties
are
too
small
to
permit
of
letting
off
a
portion
and
as
regards
the
larger
farms
the
tendency
of
modern
cheaper
machine
methods
is
rather
to
produce
a
saving
of
the
more
costly
manual
labor
for
some
time
past
germany
has
no
longer
been
in
the
position
of
feeding
her
own
population
and
large
quantities
of
food
as
have
to
be
imported
for
which
exports
have
to
be
exchanged
it
is
doubtful
whether
even
this
can
for
long
keep
pace
with
the
present
rate
of
increase
of
population
there
were
other
utterances
which
just
as
frankly
acknowledged
that
having
produced
surplus
population
germany
proposed
to
procure
by
means
of
war
the
expansion
necessary
to
care
for
it
adelyne
more
in
uncontrolled
breeding
a
study
of
the
birth
rate
in
its
relation
to
war
quoted
the
berliner
post
can
a
great
and
rapidly
growing
nation
like
germany
always
renounce
all
claims
to
further
development
or
to
the
expansion
of
its
political
power
the
final
settlement
with
france
and
england
the
expansion
of
our
colonial
possessions
in
order
to
create
new
german
homes
for
the
overflow
of
our
population
these
are
problems
which
must
be
faced
in
the
near
future
this
was
published
in
just
as
frank
was
the
recognition
of
the
true
cause
of
international
conflicts
by
a
number
of
british
authorities
in
uncontrolled
breeding
the
author
quotes
the
british
national
commission
report
on
the
declining
birth
rate
the
pressure
of
population
in
any
country
brings
as
a
chief
historic
consequence
overflows
and
migrations
not
only
for
peaceful
settlement
but
for
conquest
and
for
the
subjugation
and
exploitation
of
weaker
peoples
this
always
remains
a
chief
cause
of
international
disputes
the
militaristic
claim
for
germany
right
to
new
territory
was
simply
a
claim
to
the
right
of
life
and
food
for
the
german
babies
the
same
right
that
a
chick
claims
to
burst
its
shell
if
there
had
not
been
other
millions
of
people
claiming
the
same
right
there
would
have
been
no
war
but
there
were
other
millions
the
german
rulers
and
leaders
pointed
out
the
fact
that
expansion
meant
more
business
for
german
merchants
more
work
for
german
workmen
at
better
wages
and
more
opportunities
for
germans
abroad
they
also
pointed
out
that
lack
of
expansion
meant
crowding
and
crushing
at
home
hard
times
heavy
burdens
lack
of
opportunity
for
germans
and
what
not
in
this
way
they
gave
the
people
of
the
empire
a
startling
and
true
picture
of
what
would
happen
from
overcrowding
once
they
realized
the
facts
the
majority
of
germans
naturally
welcomed
the
war
of
defense
the
argument
was
sound
once
the
german
mothers
had
submitted
to
the
plea
for
overbreeding
it
was
inevitable
that
imperialistic
germany
should
make
war
once
the
battalions
of
unwanted
babies
came
into
existence
babies
whom
the
mothers
did
not
want
but
which
they
bore
as
a
patriotic
duty
it
was
too
late
to
avoid
international
conflict
the
great
crime
of
imperialistic
germany
was
its
high
birth
rate
it
has
always
been
so
behind
all
war
has
been
the
pressure
of
population
historians
says
huxley
point
to
the
greed
and
ambition
of
rulers
the
reckless
turbulence
of
the
ruled
to
the
debasing
effects
of
wealth
and
luxury
and
to
the
devastating
wars
which
have
formed
a
great
part
of
the
occupation
of
mankind
as
the
causes
of
the
decay
of
states
and
the
foundering
of
old
civilizations
and
thereby
point
their
story
with
a
moral
but
beneath
all
this
superficial
turmoil
lay
the
impulse
given
by
unlimited
multiplication
robert
thomas
malthus
formulator
of
the
doctrine
which
bears
his
name
pointed
out
in
the
closing
years
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
relation
of
overpopulation
to
war
he
showed
that
mankind
tends
to
increase
faster
than
the
food
supply
he
demonstrated
that
were
it
not
for
the
more
common
diseases
for
plague
famine
floods
and
wars
human
beings
would
crowd
each
other
to
such
an
extent
that
the
misery
would
be
even
greater
than
it
now
is
these
he
described
as
natural
checks
pointing
out
that
as
long
as
no
other
checks
are
employed
such
disasters
are
unavoidable
if
we
do
not
exercise
sufficient
judgment
to
regulate
the
birth
rate
we
encounter
disease
starvation
and
war
both
darwin
and
john
stuart
mill
recognized
by
inference
at
least
the
fact
that
natural
checks
and
among
them
war
will
operate
if
some
sort
of
limitation
is
not
employed
in
his
of
darwin
says
there
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
that
every
organic
being
naturally
increases
at
so
high
a
rate
if
not
destroyed
that
the
earth
would
soon
be
covered
by
the
progeny
of
a
single
pair
elsewhere
he
observes
that
we
do
not
permit
helpless
human
beings
to
die
off
but
we
create
philanthropies
and
charities
build
asylums
and
hospitals
and
keep
the
medical
profession
busy
preserving
those
who
could
not
otherwise
survive
john
stuart
mill
supporting
the
views
of
malthus
speaks
to
exactly
the
same
effect
in
regard
to
the
multiplying
power
of
organic
beings
among
them
humanity
in
other
words
let
countries
become
overpopulated
and
war
is
inevitable
it
follows
as
daylight
follows
the
sunrise
when
charles
bradlaugh
and
annie
besant
were
on
trial
in
england
in
for
publishing
information
concerning
contraceptives
besant
put
the
case
bluntly
to
the
court
and
the
jury
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
natural
checks
were
allowed
to
operate
right
through
the
human
as
they
do
in
the
animal
world
a
better
result
would
follow
among
the
brutes
the
weaker
are
driven
to
the
wall
the
diseased
fall
out
in
the
race
of
life
the
old
brutes
when
feeble
or
sickly
are
killed
if
men
insisted
that
those
who
were
sickly
should
be
allowed
to
die
without
help
of
medicine
or
science
if
those
who
are
weak
were
put
upon
one
side
and
crushed
if
those
who
were
old
and
useless
were
killed
if
those
who
were
not
capable
of
providing
food
for
themselves
were
allowed
to
starve
if
all
this
were
done
the
struggle
for
existence
among
men
would
be
as
real
as
it
is
among
brutes
and
would
doubtless
result
in
the
production
of
a
higher
race
of
men
but
are
you
willing
to
do
that
or
to
allow
it
to
be
done
we
are
not
willing
to
let
it
be
done
mother
hearts
cling
to
children
no
matter
how
diseased
misshapen
and
miserable
sons
and
daughters
hold
fast
to
parents
no
matter
how
helpless
we
do
not
allow
the
weak
to
depart
neither
do
we
cease
to
bring
more
weak
and
helpless
beings
into
the
world
among
the
dire
results
is
war
which
kills
off
not
the
weak
and
the
helpless
but
the
strong
and
the
fit
what
shall
be
done
we
have
our
choice
of
one
of
three
policies
we
may
abandon
our
science
and
leave
the
weak
and
diseased
to
die
or
kill
them
as
the
brutes
do
or
we
may
go
on
overpopulating
the
earth
and
have
our
famines
and
our
wars
while
the
earth
exists
or
we
can
accept
the
third
sane
sensible
moral
and
practicable
plan
of
birth
control
we
can
refuse
to
bring
weak
the
helpless
and
the
unwanted
children
into
the
world
we
can
refuse
to
overcrowd
families
nations
and
the
earth
there
are
these
ways
to
meet
the
situation
and
only
these
three
ways
the
world
will
never
abandon
its
preventive
and
curative
science
it
may
be
expected
to
elevate
and
extend
it
beyond
our
present
imagination
the
efforts
to
do
away
with
famine
and
the
opposition
to
war
are
growing
by
leaps
and
bounds
upon
these
efforts
are
largely
based
our
modern
social
revolutions
there
remains
only
the
third
expedient
birth
control
the
real
cure
for
war
this
fact
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
peace
conference
in
paris
in
by
the
malthusian
league
which
adopted
the
following
resolution
at
its
annual
general
meeting
in
london
in
june
of
that
year
the
malthusian
league
desires
to
point
out
that
the
proposed
scheme
for
the
league
of
nations
has
neglected
to
take
account
of
the
important
questions
of
pressure
of
which
the
great
international
economic
and
rivalry
and
of
the
of
which
is
put
forward
as
a
justification
for
increase
of
it
therefore
wishes
to
put
on
record
its
belief
that
the
league
of
nations
will
only
be
able
to
fulfill
its
aim
it
adds
a
to
the
following
effect
each
nation
desiring
to
enter
into
the
league
of
nations
shall
pledge
itself
to
restrict
its
birth
that
its
people
shall
be
able
to
live
in
comfort
their
own
dominions
without
for
territorial
expansion
and
that
it
shall
recognize
that
of
population
shall
not
a
demand
either
for
increase
of
territory
or
for
the
compulsion
of
other
nations
to
admit
its
emigrants
so
that
when
all
nations
in
the
league
have
shown
their
ability
to
live
on
their
own
resources
without
international
rivalry
they
will
be
in
a
position
to
fuse
into
an
international
federation
and
territorial
boundaries
will
then
have
little
significance
as
a
matter
of
course
the
peace
conference
paid
no
attention
to
the
resolution
for
as
pointed
out
by
frank
vanderlip
the
american
financier
that
conference
not
only
ignored
the
economic
factors
of
the
world
situation
but
seemed
unaware
that
europe
had
produced
more
people
than
its
fields
could
feed
so
the
resolution
amounted
to
so
much
propaganda
and
nothing
more
this
remedy
can
be
applied
only
by
woman
and
she
will
apply
it
she
must
and
will
see
past
the
call
of
pretended
patriotism
and
of
glory
of
empire
and
perceive
what
is
true
and
what
is
false
in
these
things
she
will
discover
what
base
uses
the
militarist
and
the
exploiter
make
of
the
idealism
of
peoples
under
the
clamor
of
the
press
permeating
the
ravings
of
the
jingoes
she
will
hear
the
voice
of

we

therefore

of

is
when
he
speaks
of
the
glory
of
the

and
the
prestige
of
the

has
its
appeal
its
shibboleth

to
the

the

and
other
material

they
wished
to
inspire

strongest
argument
perhaps
was
a
certain
phase
of
liberty
which
she
guarantees
her
subjects
and
the
protection
afforded
them
wherever
they
may
go
france
and
the
united
states
too
have
their
appeals
to
the
idealism
of
democracy
appeals
which
the
politicians
of
both
countries
know
well
how
to
use
though
the
peoples
of
both
lands
are
beginning
to
awake
to
the
fact
that
their
countries
have
been
living
on
the
glories
of
their
revolutions
and
traditions
rather
than
the
substance
of
freedom
behind
the
boast
of

behind
the

concerning
liberty
in

that
behind
all
the
slogans
and
shibboleths
coined
out
of
the
ideals
of
the
peoples
for
the
uses
of
imperialism
woman
must
and
will
see
the
iron
hand
of
that
same
imperialism
condemning
women
to

and
men
to
die
for
the

of
the
rulers

the

woman
and
the
new
morality
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
woman
conscious
of
her
freedom
rests
the
responsibility
of
creating
a
new
sex
morality
the
vital
difference
between
a
morality
thus
created
by
women
and
the
morality
of
is
that
the
new
standard
will
be
based
upon
knowledge
and
freedom
while
the
old
is
founded
upon
ignorance
and
submission
what
part
will
birth
control
play
in
bringing
forth
this
new
standard
what
effect
will
its
practice
have
upon
woman
moral
development
will
it
lift
her
to
heights
that
she
has
not
yet
achieved
and
if
so
how
why
is
the
question
of
morality
always
raised
by
the
objector
to
birth
control
all
these
questions
must
be
answered
if
we
are
to
get
a
true
picture
of
the
relation
of
the
feminine
spirit
to
morals
they
can
best
be
answered
by
considering
first
the
source
of
our
present
standard
of
sex
morals
and
the
reasons
why
those
standards
are
what
they
are
and
second
the
source
and
probable
nature
of
the
new
morality
we
get
most
of
our
notions
of
sex
morality
from
the
christian
church
more
particularly
from
the
oldest
existing
christian
church
known
as
the
roman
catholic
the
church
has
generally
defined
the
immoral
woman
as
one
who
mates
out
of
wedlock
virtually
it
lets
it
go
at
that
in
its
practical
workings
there
is
nothing
in
the
church
code
of
morals
to
protect
the
woman
either
from
unwilling
submission
to
the
wishes
of
her
husband
from
undesired
pregnancy
nor
from
any
other
of
the
outrages
only
too
familiar
to
many
married
women
nothing
is
said
about
the
crime
of
bringing
an
unwanted
child
into
the
world
where
often
it
can
not
be
adequately
cared
for
and
is
therefore
condemned
to
a
life
of
misery
the
church
one
point
of
insistence
is
upon
the
right
of
itself
to
legalize
marriage
and
to
compel
the
woman
to
submit
to
whatever
such
marriage
may
bring
it
is
true
that
there
are
remedies
of
divorce
in
the
case
of
the
state
but
the
church
has
adhered
strictly
to
the
principle
that
marriage
once
consummated
is
indissoluble
thus
in
its
operation
the
church
code
of
sex
morals
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
basic
sex
rights
of
the
woman
but
enforces
rather
the
assumed
property
rights
of
the
man
to
the
body
and
the
services
of
his
wife
they
are
codes
their
vital
factor
as
they
apply
to
woman
is
submission
to
the
man
closely
associated
with
and
underlying
the
principle
of
submission
has
been
the
doctrine
that
the
sex
life
is
in
itself
unclean
it
follows
therefore
that
all
knowledge
of
the
sex
physiology
or
sex
functions
is
also
unclean
and
taboo
upon
this
teaching
has
been
founded
woman
subjection
by
the
church
and
largely
through
the
influence
of
the
church
her
subjection
by
the
state
to
the
needs
of
the
man
let
us
see
how
these
principles
have
affected
the
development
of
the
present
moral
codes
and
some
of
their
shifting
standards
when
we
have
finished
this
analysis
we
shall
know
why
objectors
to
birth
control
raise
the
morality
question
the
church
has
sought
to
keep
women
ignorant
upon
the
plea
of
keeping
them
pure
to
this
end
it
has
used
the
state
as
its
moral
policeman
men
have
largely
broken
the
grip
of
the
ecclesiastics
upon
masculine
education
the
ban
upon
geology
and
astronomy
because
they
refute
the
biblical
version
of
the
creation
of
the
world
are
no
longer
effective
medicine
biology
and
the
doctrine
of
evolution
have
won
their
way
to
recognition
in
spite
of
the
united
opposition
of
the
clerics
so
too
has
the
right
of
woman
to
go
unveiled
to
be
educated
and
to
speak
from
public
platforms
been
asserted
in
spite
of
the
condemnations
of
the
church
which
denounced
them
as
destructive
of
feminine
purity
only
in
sex
matters
has
it
succeeded
in
keeping
the
bugaboo
alive
it
clings
to
this
last
stronghold
of
ignorance
knowing
that
woman
free
from
sexual
domination
would
produce
a
race
spiritually
free
and
strong
enough
to
break
the
last
of
the
bonds
of
intellectual
darkness
it
is
within
the
marriage
bonds
rather
than
outside
them
that
the
greatest
immorality
of
men
has
been
perpetrated
church
and
state
through
their
canons
and
their
laws
have
encouraged
this
immorality
it
is
here
that
the
woman
who
is
to
win
her
way
to
the
new
morality
will
meet
the
most
difficult
part
of
her
task
of
moral
house
cleaning
in
the
days
when
the
church
was
striving
for
supremacy
when
it
needed
preachers
proselyters
and
teachers
it
fastened
upon
its
people
the
idea
that
all
sexual
union
in
marriage
or
out
of
it
is
sinful
that
idea
colors
the
doctrines
of
the
church
of
rome
and
many
other
christian
denominations
to
this
hour
marriage
even
for
the
sake
of
children
was
a
carnal
indulgence
in
earlier
times
as
principal
donaldson
points
out
in
position
of
women
among
the
early
footnote
contemporary
review
it
was
held
that
the
child
was
conceived
in
sin
and
that
as
the
result
of
the
sex
act
an
unclean
spirit
had
possession
of
it
this
spirit
can
be
removed
only
by
baptism
and
the
roman
catholic
baptismal
service
even
yet
contains
these
words
go
out
of
him
thou
unclean
spirit
and
give
place
unto
the
holy
spirit
the
paraclete
in
the
development
of
john
william
draper
speaking
of
the
teaching
of
celibacy
among
the
early
fathers
footnote
page
says
the
sinfulness
of
the
marriage
relation
and
the
preeminent
value
of
chastity
followed
from
their
principles
if
it
was
objected
to
such
practices
that
by
their
universal
adoption
the
human
species
would
soon
be
extinguished
and
no
man
would
remain
to
offer
praises
to
god
these
zealots
remembering
the
temptations
from
which
they
had
escaped
with
truth
replied
that
there
would
always
be
sinners
enough
in
the
world
to
avoid
that
disaster
and
that
out
of
their
evil
work
good
would
be
brought
saint
jerome
offers
us
the
pregnant
reflection
that
though
it
may
be
marriage
that
fills
the
earth
it
is
virginity
that
replenishes
heaven
the
early
church
taught
that
there
were
enough
children
on
earth
it
needed
missionaries
more
than
it
needed
babies
and
impressed
upon
its
followers
the
idea
that
the
birth
wails
of
the
infant
were
a
protest
against
being
born
into
so
sordid
a
world
thus
are
we
presented
with
one
of
the
enormous
inconsistencies
of
the
church
in
sex
matters
the
teachings
of
the
early
fathers
were
effect
the
advocacy
of
an
attempt
to
enforce
birth
control
through
absolute
continence
while
later
it
reverted
as
it
reverts
to
the
mosaic
injunction
to
be
fruitful
and
multiply
the
very
force
of
the
sex
urge
in
humanity
compelled
the
church
to
abandon
the
teaching
of
celibacy
for
its
general
membership
paul
who
preferred
to
see
christians
unmarried
rather
than
married
had
recognized
the
power
of
this
force
in
the
seventh
chapter
of
the
first
epistle
to
the
corinthians
according
to
the
douay
translation
of
the
vulgate
which
is
accepted
by
the
church
of
rome
he
said
but
i
say
unto
you
the
unmarried
and
the
widows
it
is
good
if
they
continue
even
as
i
but
if
they
do
not
contain
themselves
let
them
marry
for
it
is
better
to
marry
than
to
be
burnt
when
the
church
became
a
political
power
rather
than
a
strictly
religious
institution
it
needed
a
high
birth
rate
to
provide
laymen
to
support
its
increasingly
expensive
organization
it
then
began
to
exploit
the
sex
force
for
its
own
interest
it
reversed
its
position
in
regard
to
children
it
encouraged
marriage
under
its
own
control
and
exhorted
women
to
bear
as
many
children
as
possible
the
world
was
just
as
sordid
and
the
birth
wails
of
the
infants
were
just
as
piteous
but
the
needs
of
the
hierarchy
had
changed
so
it
modified
the
standard
of
sex
morality
to
suit
its
own
requirements
marriage
now
became
a
sacrament
shrewd
in
changing
its
general
policy
from
celibacy
to
marriage
the
church
was
equally
shrewd
in
perpetuating
the
doctrine
of
subjection
for
its
own
interest
that
doctrine
was
emphatically
stated
in
the
third
chapter
of
the
first
epistle
of
peter
and
the
fifth
chapter
of
paul
epistle
to
the
ephesians
in
the
douay
version
of
the
latter
we
find
this
let
women
be
subject
to
their
husbands
as
to
the
lord
because
the
husband
is
the
head
of
the
wife
as
christ
is
the
head
of
the
church
therefore
as
the
church
is
subject
to
christ
so
let
the
wives
be
to
their
husbands
in
all
things
these
doctrines
together
with
the
teaching
that
sex
life
is
of
itself
unclean
formed
the
basis
of
morality
as
fixed
by
the
roman
church
nor
does
the
james
version
of
the
bible
generally
used
by
protestant
churches
differ
greatly
in
these
particulars
from
the
accepted
roman
catholic
version
as
a
comparison
will
show
if
christianity
turned
the
clock
of
general
progress
back
a
thousand
years
it
turned
back
the
clock
two
thousand
years
for
woman
its
greatest
outrage
upon
her
was
to
forbid
her
to
control
the
function
of
motherhood
under
any
circumstances
thus
limiting
her
life
work
to
bringing
forth
and
rearing
children
coincident
with
this
the
churchmen
deprived
her
of
her
place
in
and
before
the
courts
in
the
schools
in
literature
art
and
society
they
shut
from
her
heart
and
her
mind
the
knowledge
of
her
love
life
and
her
reproductive
functions
they
chained
her
to
the
position
into
which
they
had
thrust
her
so
that
it
is
only
after
centuries
of
effort
that
she
is
even
beginning
to
regain
what
was
wrested
from
her
christianity
had
no
favorable
effect
upon
women
says
donaldson
but
tended
to
lower
their
character
and
contract
the
range
of
their
activity
at
the
time
when
christianity
dawned
upon
the
world
women
had
attained
great
freedom
power
and
influence
in
the
roman
empire
tradition
was
in
favor
of
restriction
but
by
a
concurrence
of
circumstances
women
had
been
liberated
from
the
enslaving
fetters
of
the
old
legal
forms
they
enjoyed
freedom
of
intercourse
in
society
they
walked
in
the
public
thoroughfares
with
veils
that
did
not
hide
their
faces
they
dined
in
the
company
of
men
they
studied
literature
and
philosophy
they
took
part
in
political
movements
they
were
allowed
to
defend
their
own
law
cases
if
they
liked
and
they
helped
their
husbands
in
the
government
of
provinces
and
the
writing
of
books
and
again
one
would
have
imagined
that
christianity
would
have
favored
the
extension
of
woman
freedom
in
a
very
short
time
women
are
seen
only
in
two
capacities
as
martyrs
and
deaconesses
or
nuns
now
what
the
early
christians
did
was
to
strike
the
male
out
of
the
definition
of
man
and
human
being
out
of
the
definition
of
woman
man
was
a
human
being
made
to
serve
the
highest
and
noblest
purposes
woman
was
a
female
made
to
serve
only
one
thus
the
position
attained
by
women
of
greece
and
rome
through
the
exercise
of
family
limitation
and
in
a
considerable
degree
of
voluntary
motherhood
was
swept
away
by
the
rising
tide
of
christianity
it
would
seem
that
this
pernicious
result
was
premeditated
and
that
from
the
very
early
days
of
christianity
there
were
among
the
hierarchy
those
who
recognized
the
creative
power
of
the
feminine
spirit
the
force
of
which
they
sought
to
turn
to
their

it
is
that
the
hierarchy
created
about

whole

an
atmosphere
of
degradation

and

have
stood
as
grim
guardians
against
the
gate
of

and
constructive

the
sex
life
of
women
has
been
clouded
in
darkness
restrictive

and

church

forbidden

she

to
give

become
inconsequential
in
nature
and
in
number
out
of
woman
inner
nature
in
rebellion
against
these
conditions
is
rising
the
new
morality
let
it
be
realized
that
this
creation
of
new
sex
ideals
is
a
challenge
to
the
church
being
a
challenge
to
the
church
it
is
also
in
less
degree
a
challenge
to
the
state
the
woman
who
takes
a
fearless
stand
for
the
incoming
sex
ideals
must
expect
to
be
assailed
by
reactionaries
of
every
kind
imperialists
and
exploiters
will
fight
hardest
in
the
open
but
the
ecclesiastic
will
fight
longest
in
the
dark
he
understands
the
situation
best
of
all
he
best
knows
what
reaction
he
has
to
fear
from
the
morals
of
women
who
have
attained
liberty
for
be
it
repeated
the
church
has
always
known
and
feared
the
spiritual
potentialities
of
woman
freedom
and
in
this
lies
the
answer
to
the
question
why
the
opponent
of
birth
control
raises
the
moral
issue
sex
morals
for
women
have
been
they
have
been
purely
negative
inhibitory
and
repressive
they
have
been
fixed
by
agencies
which
have
sought
to
keep
women
enslaved
which
have
been
determined
even
as
they
are
now
to
use
woman
solely
as
an
asset
to
the
church
the
state
and
the
man
any
means
of
freedom
which
will
enable
women
to
live
and
think
for
themselves
first
will
be
attacked
as
immoral
by
these
selfish
agencies
what
effect
will
the
practice
of
birth
control
have
upon
woman
moral
development
as
we
have
seen
in
other
chapters
it
will
break
her
bonds
it
will
free
her
to
understand
the
cravings
and
soul
needs
of
herself
and
other
women
it
will
enable
her
to
develop
her
love
nature
separate
from
and
independent
of
her
maternal
nature
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
woman
whose
children
are
desired
and
are
of
such
number
that
she
can
not
only
give
them
adequate
care
but
keep
herself
mentally
and
spiritually
alive
as
well
as
physically
fit
can
discharge
her
duties
to
her
children
much
better
than
the
overworked
broken
and
querulous
mother
of
a
large
unwanted
family
thus
the
way
is
open
to
her
for
a
twofold
development
first
through
her
own
full
rounded
life
and
next
through
her
loving
unstrained
relationship
with
her
offspring
the
bloom
of
mother
love
will
have
an
opportunity
to
infuse
itself
into
her
soul
and
make
her
indeed
the
fond
affectionate
guardian
of
her
offspring
that
sentiment
now
pictures
her
but
hard
facts
deny
her
the
privilege
of
being
she
will
preserve
also
her
love
life
with
her
mate
in
its
ripening
perfection
she
will
want
children
with
a
deeper
passion
and
will
love
them
with
a
far
greater
love
in
spite
of
the
teaching
that
sex
life
in
itself
is
unclean
the
world
has
been
moving
to
a
realization
that
a
great
love
between
a
man
and
woman
is
a
holy
thing
freighted
with
great
possibilities
for
spiritual
growth
the
fear
of
unwanted
children
removed
the
assurance
that
she
will
have
a
sufficient
amount
of
time
in
which
to
develop
her
love
life
to
its
greatest
beauty
with
its
comradeship
in
many
fields
these
will
lift
woman
by
the
very
soaring
quality
of
her
innermost
self
to
spiritual
heights
that
few
have
attained
then
the
coming
of
eagerly
desired
children
will
but
enrich
life
in
all
its
avenues
rather
than
enslave
and
impoverish
it
as
do
unwanted
ones
what
healthier
grounds
for
the
growth
of
sound
morals
could
possibly
exist
than
the
ample
spiritual
life
of
the
woman
just
depicted
free
to
follow
the
feminine
spirit
which
dwells
in
the
sanctuary
of
her
nature
she
will
in
her
daily
life
give
expression
to
that
high
idealism
which
is
the
fruit
of
that
spirit
when
it
is
unhampered
and
unviolated
the
love
for
her
mate
will
flower
in
beauty
of
deeds
that
are
pure
because
they
are
the
natural
expression
of
her
physical
mental
and
spiritual
being
the
love
for
desired
children
will
come
to
blossom
in
a
spirituality
that
is
high
because
it
is
free
to
reach
the
heights
the
moral
force
of
woman
nature
will
be
unchained
and
of
its
own
dynamic
power
will
uplift
her
to
a
plane
unimagined
by
those
holding
fast
to
the
old
standards
of
church
morality
love
is
the
greatest
force
of
the
universe
freed
of
its
bonds
of
submission
and
unwanted
progeny
it
will
formulate
and
compel
of
its
own
nature
observance
to
standards
of
purity
far
beyond
the
highest
conception
of
the
average
moralist
the
feminine
spirit
animated
by
joyous
triumphant
love
will
make
its
own
high
tenets
of
morality
free
womanhood
out
of
the
depths
of
its
rich
experiences
will
observe
and
comply
with
the
inner
demands
of
its
being
the
manner
in
which
it
learns
to
do
this
best
may
be
said
to
be
the
moral
law
of
woman
being
so
in
whatever
words
the
new
morality
may
ultimately
be
expressed
we
can
at
least
be
sure
that
it
will
meet
certain
needs
first
of
all
it
will
meet
the
physical
and
psychic
requirements
of
the
woman
herself
for
she
can
not
adequately
perform
the
feminine
functions
until
these
are
met
second
it
will
meet
the
needs
of
the
child
to
be
conceived
in
a
love
which
is
eager
to
bring
forth
a
new
life
to
be
brought
into
a
home
where
love
and
harmony
prevail
a
home
in
which
proper
preparation
has
been
made
for
its
coming
this
situation
implies
in
turn
a
number
of
conditions
foremost
among
them
is
woman
knowledge
of
her
sexual
nature
both
in
its
physiology
and
its
spiritual
significance
she
must
not
only
know
her
own
body
its
care
and
its
needs
but
she
must
know
the
power
of
the
sex
force
its
use
its
abuse
as
well
as
how
to
direct
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
race
thus
she
can
transmit
to
her
children
an
equipment
that
will
enable
them
to
break
the
bonds
that
have
held
humanity
enslaved
for
ages
to
achieve
this
she
must
have
a
knowledge
of
birth
control
she
must
also
assert
and
maintain
her
right
to
refuse
the
marital
embrace
except
when
urged
by
her
inner
nature
the
truth
makes
free
viewed
in
its
true
aspect
the
very
beauty
and
wonder
of
the
creative
impulse
will
make
evident
its
essential
purity
we
will
then
instinctively
idealize
and
keep
holy
that
expression
which
is
the
foundation
of
all
human
life
and
in
that
conception
of
sex
will
the
race
he
exalted
what
can
we
expect
of
offspring
that
are
the
result
of
accidents
who
are
brought
into
being
undesired
and
in
fear
what
can
we
hope
for
from
a
morality
that
surrounds
each
physical
union
for
the
woman
with
an
atmosphere
of
submission
and
shame
what
can
we
say
for
a
morality
that
leaves
the
husband
at
liberty
to
communicate
to
his
wife
a
venereal
disease
subversion
of
the
sex
urge
to
ulterior
purposes
has
dragged
it
to
the
level
of
the
gutter
recognition
of
its
true
nature
and
purpose
must
lift
the
race
to
spiritual
freedom
out
of
our
growing
knowledge
we
are
evolving
new
and
saner
ideas
of
life
in
general
out
of
our
increasing
sex
knowledge
we
shall
evolve
new
ideals
of
sex
these
ideals
will
spring
from
the
innermost
needs
of
women
they
will
serve
these
needs
and
express
them
they
will
be
the
foundation
of
a
moral
code
that
will
tend
to
make
fruitful
the
impulse
which
is
the
source
the
soul
and
the
crowning
glory
of
our
sexual
natures
when
women
have
raised
the
standards
of
sex
ideals
and
purged
the
human
mind
of
its
unclean
conception
of
sex
the
fountain
of
the
race
will
have
been
cleansed
mothers
will
bring
forth
in
purity
and
in
joy
a
race
that
is
morally
and
spiritually
free
chapter
xv
legislating
woman
morals
one
of
the
important
duties
before
those
women
who
are
demanding
birth
control
as
a
means
to
a
new
race
is
the
changing
of
our
obscenity
laws
this
will
be
no
easy
undertaking
it
is
usually
much
easier
to
enact
statutes
than
to
revise
them
laws
are
seldom
exactly
what
they
seem
rarely
what
their
advocates
claim
for
them
the
obscenity
statutes
are
particularly
deceptive
enacted
avowedly
to
protect
society
against
the
obscene
and
the
lewd
they
make
no
distinction
between
the
scientific
works
of
human
emancipators
like
forel
and
ellis
and
printed
matter
such
as
they
are
ostensibly
aimed
at
naturally
enough
then
detectives
and
judges
and
prosecutors
who
would
chuckle
over
pictures
that
would
make
a
woman
shudder
unite
to
suppress
the
scientific
works
and
the
treatises
which
would
enable
men
and
women
to
attain
higher
physical
mental
moral
and
spiritual
standards
woman
bent
upon
her
freedom
and
seeking
to
make
a
better
world
will
not
permit
the
indecent
and
unclean
forces
of
reaction
to
mask
themselves
forever
behind
the
plea
that
it
is
necessary
to
keep
her
in
ignorance
to
preserve
her
purity
in
the
movement
she
has
already
begun
to
fight
for
her
right
to
have
without
legal
interference
all
knowledge
pertaining
to
her
sex
nature
this
is
the
third
and
most
important
of
the
battles
for
general
liberty
upon
american
soil
it
is
most
important
because
it
is
to
purify
the
very
fountain
of
the
race
and
make
the
race
completely
free
the
first
and
most
dramatic
of
the
three
great
struggles
for
liberty
reached
its
apex
as
we
know
in
the
american
revolution
it
had
for
its
object
the
right
to
hold
such
political
beliefs
as
one
might
choose
and
to
act
in
accordance
with
those
beliefs
if
this
political
freedom
is
now
lost
to
us
it
is
because
we
did
not
hold
strongly
enough
to
those
liberties
fought
for
by
our
forefathers
nearly
a
hundred
years
after
the
revolution
the
battle
for
religious
liberty
came
to
a
climax
in
the
career
of
robert
ingersoll
his
championship
of
the
much
vaunted
and
little
exercised
freedom
of
religious
opinion
swept
the
blasphemy
laws
into
the
lumber
room
of
outworn
tyrannies
those
yet
remaining
upon
the
statute
books
are
invoked
but
rarely
and
then
the
effort
to
enforce
them
is
ridiculous
within
a
few
years
the
tragic
combination
of
false
moral
standards
and
infamous
obscenity
laws
will
be
as
ridiculous
in
the
public
mind
as
are
the
now
all
but
forgotten
blasphemy
laws
if
the
obscenity
laws
are
not
radically
revised
or
repealed
few
reactionaries
will
dare
to
face
the
public
derision
that
will
greet
their
attempts
to
use
them
to

the

a
saying
concerning

main
the
dead
hand
this
hand
of
the
past
reaches
up
into
the
present
to
smother
the
rising
flame
of
modern
ideals
to
reforge
our
chains
when
we
have
broken
them
to
arrest

it
is
the
hand
of
such
as
have
lived
on
earth
but
have
not
loved
humanity
at
the
call
of
those
who
fear
progress
and

it
rises
from
the
gloom
of
forgotten
things
to
oppress
the

it
is
the
dead
hand
that
holds
imprisoned
within
the
obscenity
laws
all
direct
information
concerning

control
it
is
the
dead
hand
that
thus
compels
millions
of
american
women
to
remain
in
the
bondage
of
maternity
previous
to
the
year
the
obscenity
laws
of
the
various
states
in
the
union
contained
no
specific
prohibition
of
information
concerning
contraceptives
in
that
year
however
the
general
assembly
of
new
york
passed
an
act
which
specifically
included
the
subject
of
contraceptives
the
act
made
it
exactly
as
great
an
offense
to
give
such
information
as
to
exhibit
the
sort
of
pictures
and
writings
at
which
the
legislation
was
ostensibly
aimed
in
the
late
anthony
comstock
who
with
a
list
of
contributors
most
of
whom
did
not
realize
the
real
effects
of
his
work
constituted
the
society
for
the
suppression
of
vice
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
passage
of
the
federal
obscenity
act
this
act
was
presented
as
one
to
prevent
the
circulation
of
pornographic
literature
and
pictures
among
school
children
as
such
it
was
rushed
through
with
two
hundred
sixty
other
acts
in
the
closing
hours
of
the
congress
this
act
made
it
a
crime
to
use
the
mails
to
convey
contraceptives
or
information
concerning
contraceptives
other
acts
later
made
the
original
law
applicable
to
express
companies
and
other
common
carriers
as
well
as
to
the
mails
with
this
precedent
established
a
precedent
which
a
majority
of
the
congressmen
could
hardly
have
understood
because
of
the
hasty
passage
of
the
act
comstock
secured
the
enactment
of
state
laws
to
the
same
effect
meanwhile
the
provisions
regarding
contraceptives
had
been
dropped
from
the
amended
new
york
state
law
of
in
however
a
new
section
said
to
have
been
drafted
by
comstock
himself
was
substituted
for
the
one
enacted
in
and
that
section
is
essentially
the
substance
of
the
present
law
none
of
these
acts
made
it
an
offense
to
prevent
conception
all
of
them
provided
punishment
for
anyone
disseminating
information
concerning
the
prevention
of
conception
in
the
federal
statutes
the
maximum
penalties
were
fixed
at
a
fine
of
or
five
years
imprisonment
or
both
the
usual
maximum
penalty
under
a
state
law
is
a
fine
of
or
one
imprisonment
or
both
comstock
has
passed
out
of
public
notice
his
body
has
been
entombed
but
the
evil
that
he
did
lives
after
him
his
dead
hand
still
reaches
forth
to
keep
the
subject
of
prevention
of
conception
where
he
placed
it
in
the
same
legal
category
with
things
unclean
and
vile
forty
years
ago
the
laws
were
changed
and
the
chief
work
of
comstock
life
accomplished
those
laws
still
live
legal
monuments
to
ignorance
and
to
oppression
through
those
laws
reaches
the
dead
hand
to
bring
to
the
operating
table
each
year
hundreds
of
thousands
of
women
who
undergo
the
agony
of
abortion
each
year
this
hand
reaches
out
to
compel
the
birth
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
infants
who
must
die
before
they
are
twelve
months
old
like
many
laws
upon
our
statute
books
these
are
being
persistently
and
intelligently
violated
few
members
of
the
and
wealthy
classes
think
for
a
single
moment
of
obeying
them
they
limit
their
families
to
one
two
or
three
children
usually
the
prosecutor
who
presents
the
case
against
a
advocate
trapped
by
a
detective
hired
by
the
comstock
society
has
no
children
at
all
or
a
small
family
the
family
of
the
judge
who
passes
upon
the
case
is
likely
to
be
smaller
still
the
words
it
is
the
law
sums
it
all
up
for
these
officials
when
they
pass
sentence
in
court
but
these
words
so
magical
to
the
official
mind
have
no
weight
when
these

officials
are
adjusting
their
own
private
lives
they
then
obey
the
higher
laws
of
their
own
beings
they
break
the
obsolete
statutes
for
themselves
while
enforcing
them
for
others
this
is
not
the
situation
with
the
poorer
people
of
the
united
states
however
millions
of
them
know
nothing
of
reliable
contraceptives
when
women
of
the
impoverished
strata
of
society
do
not
break
these
laws
against
contraceptives
they
violate
those
laws
of
their
inner
beings
which
tell
them
not
to
bring
children
into
the
world
to
live
in
want
disease
and
general
misery
they
break
the
first
law
of
nature
which
is
that
of
self
preservation
bound
by
false
morals
enchained
by
false
conceptions
of
religion
hindered
by
false
laws
they
endure
until
the
pressure
becomes
so
great
that
morals
religion
and
laws
alike
fail
to
restrain
them
then
they
for
a
brief
respite
resort
to
the
surgeon
instruments
for
many
years
the
witch
hunting
of
the
comstock
organization
had
a
remarkable
and
a
deadly
effect
everyone
whether
it
was
novelist
essayist
publicist
propagandist
or
artist
who
sought
to
throw
definite
light
upon
the
forbidden
subject
of
sex
or
upon
family
limitation
was
prosecuted
if
detected
among
the
many
books
suppressed
were
works
by
physicians
designed
to
warn
young
men
and
women
away
from
the
pitfalls
of
venereal
diseases
and
sexual
errors
the
darkness
that
surrounded
the
whole
field
of
sex
was
made
as
complete
as
possible
since
then
the
feeling
of
the
awakened
women
of
america
has
intensified
the
rapidity
with
which
women
are
going
into
industry
the
increasing
hardship
and
poverty
of
the
lower
strata
of
society
the
arousing
of
public
conscience
have
all
operated
to
give
force
and
volume
to
the
demand
for
woman
right
to
control
her
own
body
that
she
may
work
out
her
own
salvation
those
who
believe
in
strictly
legal
measures
as
well
as
those
who
believe
both
in
legal
measures
and
in
open
defiance
of
these
brutal
and
unjust
laws
are
demanding
amendments
to
the
obscenity
statutes
which
shall
remove
information
concerning
contraceptives
from
its
present
classification
among
things
filthy
and
obscene
an
amendment
typical
of
those
offered

that
drawn

lawfully

is
not
a

of
any
provision
of
this
this
proposed
amendment
should
without
doubt
include
midwives
as
well
as
nurses
there
are
thousands
of
women
who
never
see
a
nurse
or
a
physician
under
this
section
even
as
it
now
stands
physicians
have
a
right
to
prescribe
contraceptives
but
few
of
them
have
claimed
that
right
or
have
even
known
that
it
has
existed
it
does
exist
however
and
was
specifically
declared
by
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
as
we
shall
see
when
we
consider
that
court
opinion
in
the
sanger
case
farther
on
in
the
book
it
can
do
no
harm
to
make
the
intent
of
the
law
as
regards
physicians
plainer
and
it
would
be
an
immense
step
forward
to
include
nurses
and
midwives
in
the
section
with
this
addition
it
would
remove
one
of
the
most
serious
obstacles
to
the
freedom
and
advancement
of
american
womanhood
every
woman
interested
in
the
welfare
of
women
in
general
should
make
it
her
business
to
agitate
for
such
a
change
in
the
obscenity
laws
the
above
provision
would
take
care
of
the
case
of
the
woman
who
is
ill
or
who
is
plainly
about
to
become
ill
but
it
does
not
take
care
of
the
vast
body
of
women
who
have
not
yet
ruined
their
health
by
childbearing
and
who
are
not
yet
suffering
from
diseases
complicated
by
pregnancy
if
this
amendment
had
been
attached
to
the
laws
in
all
the
states
there
would
still
remain
much
to
be
done
shall
we
go
on
indefinitely
driving
the
now
healthy
mother
of
two
children
into
the
hands
of
the
abortionist
where
she
goes
in
preference
to
constant
ill
health
overwork
and
the
witnessing
of
dying
and
starving
babies
it
is
each
woman
duty
to
herself
and
to
society
to
hasten
the
repeal
of
all
laws
against
the
communication
of
information
now
that
she
has
the
vote
she
should
use
her
political
influence
to
strike
first
of
all
at
these
restrictive
statutes
it
is
not
to
her
credit
that
a
district
attorney
arguing
against
a
birth
control
advocate
is
able
to
show
that
women
have
made
no
effort
to
wipe
out
such
laws
in
states
where
they
have
had
the
ballot
for
years
it
is
time
that
women
assert
themselves
upon
this
fundamental
right
and
the
first
and
best
use
they
can
make
of
the
ballot
is
in
this
direction
these
laws
were
made
by
men
and
have
been
instruments
of
martyrdom
and
death
for
unnumbered
thousands
of
women
women
now
have
the
opportunity
to
sweep
them
into
the
trash
heap
they
will
do
it
at
once
unless
like
men
they
use
the
ballot
for
those
political
honors
which
many
years
of
experience
have
taught
men
to
be
hollow
it
is
only
a
question
of
how
long
it
will
take
women
to
make
up
their
minds
to
this
result
the
law
of
woman
being
is
stronger
than
any
statute
and
the
law
must
sooner
or
later
give
way
to
it
man
has
not
protected
woman
in
matters
most
vital
to
her
but
she
is
awaking
and
will
sooner
or
later
realize
this
and
assert
herself
if
she
acts
in
mass
now
it
will
be
another
cheering
evidence
that
she
is
moving
consciously
toward
her
goal

the
absurd
cruelty
of
permitting
thousands
of
women
each
year
to
go
through
abortions
to
prevent
the
aggravation
of
diseases
for
which
they
are
under
treatment
assuredly
can
not
be
much
longer
ignored
by
the
medical
profession
responsibility
for
the
inestimable
damage
done
by
the
practice
of
permitting
patients
suffering
from
certain
ailments
to
become
pregnant
because
of
their
ignorance
of
contraceptives
when
the
physician
knows
that
if
pregnancy
goes
to
its
full
term
it
will
hasten
the
disease
and
lead
to
the
patient
death
must
in
all
fairness
be
laid
at
his
door
what
these
diseases
are
and
what
dangers
are
involved
in
pregnancy
are
known
to
every
practitioner
of
standing
specialists
have
not
been
negligent
in
pointing
out
the
situation

to
enhance
or
protect
their
reputations
in
the
profession
they
continually
call
out
to
one
another
do
let
the
patient
bear
a
child
do
let
pregnancy
continue
the
warning
has
been
sounded
most
often
perhaps
in
the
cases
of
tubercular
women
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
tubercular
process
becomes
exacerbated
either
during
pregnancy
or
after
childbirth
most
authorities
recommend
that
abortion
be
induced
as
a
matter
of
routine
in
all
tubercular
women

in

advanced
tuberculosis
insanity
irremediable
malignant

hydatidiform

uncontrollable

we
know
that
abortion
when
performed
by
skilled
hands
under
right
conditions
brings
almost
no
danger
to
the
life
of
the
patient
and
we
also
know
that
particular
diseases
can
be
more
easily
combatted
after
such
an
abortion
than
during
a
pregnancy
allowed
to
come
to
full
term
but
why
not
adopt
the
easier
safer
less
repulsive
course
and
prevent
conception
altogether
why
put
these
thousands
of
women
who
each
year
undergo
such
abortions
to
the
pain
they
entail
and
in
whatever
danger
attends
them
why
continue
to
send
home
women
to
whom
pregnancy
is
a
grave
danger
with
the
futile
advice
now
do
get
this
way
again
they
are

who
have
generations
of
passion
and
passion
claim
to
outlet
they
are
sent
back
without
being
given
information
as
to
how
to
prevent
the
dangerous
pregnancy
and
are
expected
presumably
to
depend
for
their
safety
upon
the
husband
continence
the
wife
and
husband
are
thrown
together
to
bring
about
once
more
the
same
condition
back
comes
the
patient
again
in
a
few
months
to
be
aborted
and
told
once
more
not
to
do
it
again
does
any
physician
believe
that
the
picture
is
overdrawn
i
have
known
of
many
such
cases
a
recent
one
that
came
under
my
observation
was
that
of
a
woman
who
suffered
from
a
disease
of
the
kidneys
five
times
she
was
taken
to
a
maternity
hospital
in
an
ambulance
after
falling
in
offices
or
in
the
street
one
of
the
foremost
gynecologists
of
america
sent
her
out
three
times
without
giving
her
information
as
to
the
contraceptive
means
which
would
have
prevented
a
repetition
of
this
experience
why
does
this
situation
exist
we
do
not
question
the
good
intent
nor
the
high
purposes
of
these
physicians
we
know
that
they
observe
a
high
standard
of
ethics
and
that
they
are
working
for
the
uplift
of
the
race
but
here
is
a
situation
that
is
absurd
hideously
absurd
what
is
the
matter
several
factors
contribute
to
this
state
of
affairs
first
the
subject
of
contraception
has
been
kept
in
the
dark
even
in
medical
colleges
and
in
hospitals
abortion
has
been
openly
discussed
as
a
necessity
under
certain
conditions
but
the
subject
of
contraception
as
any
physician
will
admit
has
not
yet
been
brought
to
the
front
it
has
escaped
specialized
attention
in
the
laboratories
and
the
research
departments
thus
there
has
been
no
professional
stamp
of
approval
by
great
bodies
of
experimenters
the
result
is
that
the
average
physician
has
felt
that
contraceptive
methods
are
not
yet
established
as
certainties
and
has
for
that
reason
refused
to
direct
specialists
are
so
busy
with
their
own
particular
subjects
and
general
practitioners
are
so
taken
up
with
their
daily
routine
that
they
can
not
give
to
the
problem
of
contraception
the
attention
it
must
have
consultation
rooms
in
charge
of
reputable
physicians
who
have
specialized
in
contraception
assisted
by
registered
nurses
in
a
word
clinics
designed
for
this
specialty
would
meet
this
crying
need
such
clinics
should
deal
with
each
woman
individually
taking
into
account
her
particular
disease
her
temperament
her
mentality
and
her
condition
both
physical
and
economic
their
sole
function
should
be
to
prevent
pregnancy
in
accomplishing
this
purpose
a
higher
standard
of
hygiene
is
attained
not
only
would
a
burden
be
removed
from
the
physician
who
sends
a
woman
to
such
a
clinic
but
there
would
be
an
improvement
in
the
woman
general
condition
which
would
in
a
number
of
ways
reflect
itself
in
benefit
to
her
family
all
this
for
the
diseased
woman
but
every
argument
that
can
be
made
for
preventive
medicine
can
be
made
for
clinics
for
the
use
of
the
woman
who
has
not
yet
lost
her
health
sound
and
vigorous
at
the
time
of
her
marriage
she
could
remain
so
if
given
advice
as
to
by
what
means
she
could
space
her
children
and
limit
their
number
when
she
is
not
given
such
information
she
is
plunged
blindly
into
married
life
and
a
few
years
is
likely
to
find
her
with
a
large
family
herself
diseased
and
damaged
an
unfit
breeder
of
the
unfit
and
still
ignorant
what
are
the
fruits
of
this
woeful
ignorance
in
which
women
have
been
kept
first
a
tremendous
infant
mortality
hundreds
of
thousands
of
babies
dying
annually
of
diseases
which
flourish
in
poverty
and
neglect
next
the
rapid
increase
of
the
feebleminded
of
criminal
types
and
of
the
pathetic
victims
of
toil
in
the
factories
another
result
is
the
familiar
overcrowding
of
tenements
the
forcing
of
the
children
into
the
street
the
ensuing
prostitution
alcoholism
and
almost
universal
physical
and
moral
unfitness
those
abhorrent
conditions
point
to
a
blunder
upon
the
part
of
those
to
whom
we
have
entrusted
the
care
of
the
health
of
the
individual
the
family
and
the
race
the
medical
profession
neglecting
the
principle
involved
in
preventive
medicine
has
permitted
these
conditions
to
come
about
if
they
were
unavoidable
we
should
have
to
bear
with
them
but
they
are
not
unavoidable
as
shown
by
facts
and
figures
from
other
countries
where
contraceptive
information
is
available
in
holland
for
instance
where
the
information
concerning
contraceptives
has
been
accessible
to
the
people
through
clinics
and
pamphlets
since
the
general
death
rate
and
the
infant
mortality
rate
have
fallen
until
they
are
the
lowest
in
europe
amsterdam
and
the
hague
have
the
lowest
infant
mortality
rates
of
any
cities
in
the
world
it
is
good
to
know
that
the
first
of
the
clinics
of
holland
followed
shortly
after
a
thorough
and
enthusiastic
discussion
of
the
subject
at
an
international
medical
congress
in
amsterdam
in
the
dutch
league
was
founded
in
the
first
clinic
in
the
world
was
opened
in
by
aletta
jacobs
in
amsterdam
so
great
were
the
results
obtained
that
there
has
been
a
remarkable
increase
in
the
wealth
stamina
stature
and
longevity
of
the
people
as
well
as
a
gradual
increase
in
the
population
these
clinics
must
not
be
confused
with
the
white
enameled
rooms
which
we
associate
with
the
term
in
america
they
are
ordinary
offices
with
the
necessary
equipment
or
rooms
in
the
homes
of
the
nurses
fitted
out
for
the
work
they
are
places
for
consultation
and
examination
opened
by
specially
trained
nurses
who
have
been
instructed
by
rutgers
of
the
hague
secretary
of
the
league
who
has
devoted
his
life
to
this
work
there
have
been
more
than
fifty
nurses
trained
specially
for
this
work
by
rutgers
as
a
nurse
completes
her
course
of
training
she
establishes
herself
in
a
community
and
her
place
of
consultation
is
called
a
clinic
the
general
results
of
this
service
are
best
judged
by
tables
included
in
the
summary
of
marriages
births
and
deaths
in
england
wales
for
footnote
see
table
on
page
in
amsterdam
the
birth
rate
dropped
from
for
the
period
of
to
for
and
in
during
the
same
periods
the
death
rate
fell
from
to
and
in
to
infant
mortality
for
the
same
period
fell
from
for
each
thousand
living
births
to
and
in
to
illegitimate
fertility
also
decreased
results
in
other
cities
as
shown
by
the
table
at
the
end
of
this
chapter
are
exactly
similar
in
the
australian
commonwealth
where
birth
control
is
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
and
information
concerning
contraceptives
is
available
to
the
masses
the
births
were
so
well
distributed
in
that
while
the
birth
rate
was
there
was
an
infant
death
rate
of
only
new
zealand
which
is
also
one
of
the
typical
countries
had
a
birth
rate
of
and
an
infant
death
rate
of
only
for
the
same
year
these
figures
are
in
marked
and
happy
contrast
with
those
for
the
birth
registration
of
the
united
states
where
the
reports
for
show
a
birth
rate
of
but
an
infant
death
rate
of
a
similar
comparison
may
be
made
with
the
german
empire
in
where
there
was
a
birth
rate
of
in
and
an
infant
mortality
rate
of
in
these
countries
birth
control
information
is
not
so
generally
within
the
reach
of
the
masses
and
consequently
the
largest
percentage
of
births
come
to
that
class
least
able
to
bring
children
to
full
maturity
as
indicated
in
the
infant
mortality

i
am
going
to
make
a
statement
which
may
at
first
seem
exaggerated
but
which
is
nevertheless
carefully
considered
the
effort
toward
racial
progress
that
is
being
made
by
the
medical
profession
by
social
workers
by
the
various
charitable
and
philanthropic
organizations
and
by
state
institutions
for
the
physically
and
mentally
unfit
is
practically
wasted
all
these
forces
are
in
a
very
emphatic
sense
marking
time
they
will
continue
to
mark
time
until
the
medical
profession
recognizes
the
fact
that
the
ever
increasing
tide
of
the
unfit
is
overwhelming
all
that
these
agencies
are
doing
for
society
they
will
continue
to
mark
time
until
they
get
at
the
source
of
these
destructive
conditions
and
apply
a
fundamental
remedy
that
remedy
is
birth
control

progress
we
have
made
the
silence
of
the
centuries
has
been
broken
the
wrongs
of
woman
and
the
rights
of
woman
have
found
voices
these
voices
differ
from
all
others
that
have
been
raised
in
woman
behalf
they
are
not
the
individual
protests
of
great
feminine
minds
nor
the
masculine
remedies
for
masculine
oppression
suggested
by
the
stricken
consciences
of
a
few
men
great
voices
are
heard
both
of
women
and
of
men
but
intermingled
with
them
are
millions
of
voices
demanding
freedom
let
it
be
repeated
that
movements
mothered
by
emancipated
women
are
often
deceptive
in
character
the
demand
for
suffrage
the
agitation
against
child
labor
the
regulation
of
working
hours
for
women
the
insistence
upon
mothers
pensions
are
palliatives
all
yet
as
understanding
develops
and
she
learns
to
think
at
the
urgence
of
her
own
inner
nature
rather
than
at
the
dictates
of
men
she
moves
on
from
these
palliatives
to
fundamental
remedies
so
at
the
crest
of
the
wave
of
woman
revolt
comes
the
movement
for
voluntary
motherhood
not
a
separate
isolated
movement
but
the
manifestation
of
a
cosmic
force
the
force
that
moves
the
wave
itself
the
walls
of
the
cloister
have
fallen
before
the
cries
of
a
rising
womanhood
the
barriers
of
prurient
puritanism
are
being
demolished
free
woman
has
torn
the
veil
of
indecency
from
the
secrets
of
life
to
reveal
them
in
their
power
and
their
purity
womanhood
yet
bound
has
beheld
and
understood
a
public
whose
thoughts
and
opinions
had
been
governed
by
men
and
by
women
engulfed
in
the
old
order
has
been
shocked
awake
sneers
and
jests
at
birth
control
are
giving
way
to
a
reverent
understanding
of
the
needs
of
woman
they
who
deny
the
right
of
a
woman
to
control
her
own
body
speak
with
the
hardihood
of
invincible
ignorance
or
with
the
folly
of
those
blind
ones
who
in
all
ages
have
opposed
the
light
of
progress
few
there
are
to
insist
openly
that
woman
remain
a
passive
instrument
of
reproduction
the
subject
of
birth
control
is
being
lifted
out
of
the
mire
into
which
it
was
cast
by
puritanism
and
given
its
proper
place
among
the
sciences
and
the
ideals
of
this
generation
with
this
effort
has
come
an
illumination
of
all
other
social
problems
society
is
beginning
to
give
ear
to
the
promise
of
modern
womanhood
when
you
have
ceased
to
chain
me
i
shall
by
the
virtue
of
a
free
motherhood
remake
the
world
it
would
be
miraculous
indeed
if
that
victory
which
has
been
won
had
been
gained
without
great
toil
insufferable
anguish
and
sacrifice
such
as
all
persons
experience
when
they
dare
to
brave
the
conventions
of
the
dead
past
or
blaze
a
trail
for
a
new
order
but
where
the
vision
is
clear
the
faith
deep
forces
unseen
rally
to
assist
and
carry
one
over
barriers
which
would
otherwise
have
been
insurmountable
no
part
of
this
wave
of
woman
emancipation
has
won
its
way
without
such
vision
and
faith
this
is
the
one
movement
in
which
pioneering
was
unnecessary
the
cry
for
deliverance
always
goes
up
it
is
its
own
pioneer
the
facts
have
always
stared
us
in
the
face
no
one
who
has
worked
among
women
can
be
ignorant
of
them
i
remember
that
ever
since
i
was
a
child
the
idea
of
large
families
associated
itself
with
poverty
in
my
mind
as
i
grew
to
womanhood
and
found
myself
working
in
hospitals
and
in
the
homes
of
the
rich
and
the
poor
the
association
between
the
two
ideas
grew
stronger
in
every
home
of
the
poor
women
asked
me
the
same
question
as
far
back
as
i
began
to
inquire
of
my
associates
among
the
nurses
what
one
could
tell
these
worried
women
who
asked
constantly
what
can
i
do
it
is
the
voice
of
the
elemental
urge
of
woman
it
has
always
been
there
and
whether
we
have
heeded
it
or
neglected
it
we
have
always
heard
it
out
of
this
cry
came
the
birth
control
movement
economic
conditions
have
naturally
made
this
elemental
need
more
plain
sometimes
they
have
lent
a
more
desperate
voice
to
woman
cry
for
freedom
men
and
women
have
arisen
since
knowlton
and
robert
dale
owen
to
advocate
the
use
of
contraceptives
but
aside
from
these
two
none
has
come
forward
to
separate
it
from
other
issues
of
freedom
but
the
birth
control
movement
as
a
movement
for
freedom
was
born
of
that
unceasing
cry
of
the
socially
repressed
spiritually
stifled
woman
who
is
constantly
demanding
what
can
i
do
to
avoid
more
children
when
it
came
time
to
arouse
new
public
interest
in
birth
control
and
organize
a
movement
it
was
found
expedient
to
employ
direct
and
drastic
methods
to
awaken
a
slumbering
public
the
woman
rebel
a
monthly
magazine
was
established
to
proclaim
the
gospel
of
revolt
when
its
mission
was
accomplished
and
the
words
birth
control
were
on
their
way
to
be
a
symbol
of
woman
freedom
in
all
civilized
tongues
it
went
out
of
existence
the
deceptive
obscenity
law
invoked
oftener
to
repress
womanhood
and
smother
scientific
knowledge
than
to
restrain
the
distribution
of
verbal
and
pictorial
pornography
was
deliberately
challenged
this
course
had
two
purposes
it
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
and
thereby
brought
knowledge
of
contraceptives
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
women
the
first
general
organized
effort
reached
in
various
ways
to
all
parts
of
the
united
states
particular
attention
was
paid
to
the
mining
districts
of
west
virginia
and
montana
the
mill
towns
of
new
england
and
the
cotton
districts
of
the
southern
states
men
and
women
from
all
these
districts
welcomed
the
movement
they
sent
letters
pledging
their
loyalty
and
their
active
assistance
they
participated
directly
and
indirectly
in
the
protest
which
awakened
the
country
as
time
went
on
the
work
was
extended
to
various
foreign
elements
of
the
population
this
being
made
possible
by
the
enthusiastic
cooperation
of
workers
who
speak
the
foreign
languages
leagues
were
formed
to
organize
those
who
favored
changing
the
laws
lectures
were
delivered
throughout
the
united
states
articles
were
written
by
eminent
physicians
scientists
reformers
and
revolutionists
debates
were
arranged
newspapers
and
magazines
of
all
kinds
classes
and
languages
gave
the
subject
of
birth
control
serious
attention
taking
one
side
or
the
other
of
the
discussion
that
was
aroused
new
books
on
the
subject
began
to
appear
books
by
foreign
authors
were
reprinted
and
distributed
in
the
united
states
the
birth
control
review
edited
by
voluntary
effort
and
supported
by
a
stock
company
of
women
who
make
contributions
instead
of
taking
dividends
was
founded
and
continues
its
work
after
a
year
study
in
foreign
countries
for
the
purpose
of
supplementing
the
knowledge
gained
in
my
fourteen
years
as
a
nurse
i
came
back
to
the
united
states
determined
to
open
a
clinic
i
had
decided
that
there
could
be
no
better
way
of
demonstrating
to
the
public
the
necessity
of
birth
control
and
the
welcome
it
would
receive
than
by
taking
the
knowledge
of
contraceptive
methods
directly
to
those
who
most
needed
it
a
clinic
was
opened
in
brooklyn
there
women
received
information
before
the
police
closed
the
consulting
rooms
and
arrested
ethel
byrne
a
registered
nurse
fania
mindell
a
translator
and
myself
the
purpose
of
this
clinic
was
to
demonstrate
to
the
public
the
practicability
and
the
necessity
of
such
institutions
all
women
who
came
seeking
information
were
workingmen
wives
all
had
children
no
unmarried
girls
came
at
all
men
came
whose
wives
had
nursing
children
and
could
not
come
women
came
from
the
farther
parts
of
long
island
from
cities
in
massachusetts
and
connecticut
and
even
more
distant
places
mothers
brought
their
married
daughters
some
whose
ages
were
from
to
looked
fifty
but
the
clinic
gave
them
new
hope
to
face
the
years
ahead
these
women
invariably
expressed
their
love
for
children
but
voiced
a
common
plea
for
means
to
avoid
others
in
order
that
they
might
give
sufficient
care
to
those
already
born
they
wanted
them
to
grow
up
decent
for
ten
days
the
two
rooms
of
this
clinic
were
crowded
to
their
utmost
then
came
the
police
we
were
hauled
off
to
jail
and
eventually
convicted
of
a
crime
ethel
byrne
instituted
a
hunger
strike
for
eleven
days
which
attracted
attention
throughout
the
nation
it
brought
to
public
notice
the
fact
that
women
were
ready
to
die
for
the
principle
of
voluntary
motherhood
so
strong
was
the
sentiment
evoked
that
governor
whitman
pardoned
byrne
no
single
act
of
in
the
history
of
the
movement
has
done
more
to
awaken
the
conscience
of
the
public
or
to
arouse
the
courage
of
women
than
did
ethel
byrne
deed
of
uncompromising
resentment
at
the
outrage
of
jailing
women
who
were
attempting
to
disseminate
knowledge
which
would
emancipate
the
motherhood
of
america
courage
like
hers
and
like
that
of
others
who
have
undergone
arrest
and
imprisonment
or
who
night
after
night
and
day
after
day
have
faced
street
crowds
to
speak
or
to
sell
literature
the
faith
and
the
untiring
labors
of
still
others
who
have
not
come
into
public
notice
have
given
the
movement
its
dauntless
character
and
assure
the
final
victory
one
dismal
fact
had
become
clear
long
before
the
brownsville
clinic
was
opened
the
medical
profession
as
a
whole
had
ignored
the
tragic
cry
of
womanhood
for
relief
from
forced
maternity
the
private
practitioners
one
after
another
shook
their
heads
and
replied
it
can
not
be
done
it
is
against
the
law
and
the
same
answer
came
from
clinics
and
public
hospitals
the
decision
of
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
has
disposed
of
that
objection
however
though
as
yet
few
physicians
have
cared
to
make
public
the
fact
that
they
take
advantage
of
the
decision
while
the
decision
of
the
lower
courts
in
my
own
case
was
upheld
partly
because
i
was
a
nurse
and
not
a
physician
the
court
incidentally
held
that
under
the
laws
as
they
now
stand
in
new
york
any
physician
has
a
right
to
impart
information
concerning
contraceptives
to
women
as
a
measure
for
curing
or
preventing
disease
the
united
states
supreme
court
threw
out
my
appeal
without
consideration
of
the
merits
of
the
case
therefore
the
decision
of
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
stands
and
under
that
decision
a
physician
has
a
right
and
it
is
therefore
his
duty
to
prescribe
contraceptives
in
such
cases
at
least
as
those
involving
disease
it
is
true
that
section
of
the
penal
code
of
new
york
state
does
not
except
the
medical
man
and
does
not
allow
him
to
instruct
his
patient
in
birth
control
methods
even
though
she
is
suffering
from
tuberculosis
syphilis
kidney
disorders
or
heart
disease
without
looking
farther
the
physicians
had
let
that
section
go
at
its
face
value
no
doctor
had
questioned
either
its
purpose
or
its
legal
scope
the
medical
profession
was
content
to
let
this
apparent
limitation
upon
its
rights
stand
and
it
remained
for
a
woman
to
go
to
jail
to
demonstrate
the
fact
that
under
another
section
of
the
same
code
the
physician
had
the
vital
right
just
described
it
is
safe
to
say
that
many
physicians
do
not
even
yet
know
of
their
legal
rights
in
this
matter
but
here
is
what
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
said
on
january
in
an
opinion
thus
far
unquestioned
and
which
is
the
law
of
the
state
secondly
by
section
of
the
penal
law
physicians
are
excepted
from
the
provisions
of
this
act
under
circumstances
therein
mentioned
this
section
reads
article
or
instrument
used
or
applied
by
physicians
lawfully
practicing
or
by
their
direction
or
prescription
for
the
cure
or
prevention
of
disease
is
not
an
article
of
indecent
or
immoral
nature
or
use
within
this
article
the
supplying
of
such
articles
to
such
physicians
or
by
their
direction
or
prescription
is
not
an
offense
under
this
article
this
exception
in
behalf
of
physicians
does
not
permit
advertisements
regarding
such
matters
nor
promiscuous
advice
to
patients
irrespective
of
their
condition
but
it
is
broad
enough
to
protect
the
physician
who
in
good
faith
gives
such
help
or
advice
to
a
married
person
to
cure
or
prevent
disease
by
international
dictionary
is
defined
to
be
alteration
in
the
state
of
the
body
or
of
some
of
its
organs
interrupting
or
disturbing
the
performance
of
the
vital
functions
and
causing
or
threatening
pain
and
sickness
illness
disorder
the
protection
thus
afforded
the
physician
would
also
extend
to
the
druggist
or
vendor
acting
upon
the
physician
prescription
or
order
section
which
shamelessly
classes
contraceptive
information
with
abortion
and
things
obscene
still
stands
but
under
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
it
is
the
law
of
new
york
state
that
physicians
have
the
right
which
they
were
seemingly
denied
such
is
probably
the
fact
also
in
many
other
states
for
the
obscenity
laws
are
modelled
more
or
less
after
the
same
pattern
one
of
the
chief
results
of
the
brownsville
clinic
was
that
of
establishing
for
physicians
a
right
which
they
neglected
to
establish
for
themselves
but
which
they
are
bound
in
the
very
nature
of
things
to
exercise
to
an
increasing
degree
similar
tests
by
women
in
other
states
would
doubtless
establish
the
right
elsewhere
in
america
we
know
of
some
arrests
of
women
and
men
who
have
dared
entrenched
prejudice
and
the
law
to
further
the
cause
of
birth
control
the
persistent
work
in
behalf
of
the
movement
attended
as
it
was
by
danger
of
fines
and
jail
sentences
seemed
to
puzzle
the
authorities
sometimes
they
dismissed
the
arrested
persons
sometimes
they
fined
them
sometimes
they
imprisoned
them
but
the
protests
went
on
and
through
these
word
of
the
movement
went
constantly
to
more
and
more
people
each
of
these
arrests
brought
added
publicity
each
became
a
center
of
local
agitation
each
brought
a
part
of
the
public
at
least
face
to
face
with
the
issue
between
the
women
of
america
and
this
barbarous
law
many
thousands
of
letters
have
been
answered
and
thousands
of
women
have
been
given
personal
consultations
each
letter
and
each
consultation
means
another
center
of
influence
from
which
the
gospel
of
voluntary
motherhood
spreads
forced
thus
to
the
front
the
problems
of
birth
control
and
the
right
of
voluntary
motherhood
have
been
brought
more
and
more
to
the
attention
of
medical
students
nurses
midwives
physicians
scientists
and
sociologists
a
new
literature
ranging
all
the
way
from
discussion
of
the
means
of
preventing
conception
to
the
social
political
ethical
moral
and
spiritual
possibilities
of
birth
control
is
coming
into
being
woman
cry
for
liberty
is
infusing
itself
into
the
thoughts
and
the
consciences
and
the
aspirations
of
the
intellectual
leaders
as
well
as
into
the
idealism
of
society
it
is
but
a
few
years
since
it
was
said
of
the
woman
rebel
that
it
was
the
first
head
raised
in
america
it
is
but
a
few
years
since
men
as
well
as
women
trembled
at
the
temerity
of
a
public
discussion
in
which
the
subject
of
sex
was
mentioned
but
measured
in
progress
it
is
a
far
cry
from
those
days
the
public
has
read
of
birth
control
on
the
first
page
of
its
newspapers
it
has
discussed
it
in
meetings
and
in
clubs
it
has
been
a
favorite
topic
of
discussion
at
correct
teas
the
scientist
is
giving
it
reverent
and
profound
attention
even
the
minister
seeking
to
keep
abreast
of
the
times
proclaims
it
from
the
pulpit
and
everywhere
women
and
men
those
with
the
vision
with
a
comprehension
of
present
and
future
needs
of
society
are
working
to
bring
this
message
to
those
who
have
not
yet
realized
its
immense
and
regenerating
import
the
american
public
in
a
word
has
been
permeated
with
the
message
of
birth
control
its
reaction
to
that
message
has
been
exceedingly
encouraging
people
by
the
thousands
have
flocked
to
the
meetings
only
the
official
mind
serving
ancient
prejudices
under
the
cloak
of
law
and
order
has
been
in
opposition
it
is
plain
that
puritanism
is
in
the
throes
of
a
lingering
death
if
anyone
doubts
it
let
it
be
remembered
that
the
same
people
who
a
few
years
ago
formed
the
official
opinion
of
puritanism
have
so
far
forsaken
puritanism
as
to
flood
the
country
with
millions
of
pamphlets
discussing
sex
matters
and
venereal
disease
this
literature
was
distributed
by
the
united
states
government
by
state
governments
by
the
the
and
by
similar
organizations
it
treated
the
physiology
of
sex
far
more
definitely
than
has
literature
this
official
educational
barrage
was
at
once
a
splendid
salute
to
the
right
of
women
and
men
to
know
their
own
bodies
and
the
last
heavy
firing
in
the
main
battle
against
ignorance
in
the
field
of
sex
what
remains
now
is
but
to
take
advantage
of
the
victories
what
does
it
all
mean
it
means
that
american
womanhood
is
blasting
its
way
through
the
d√©bris
of
crumbling
moral
and
religious
systems
toward
freedom
it
means
that
the
path
is
all
but
clear
it
means
that
woman
has
but
to
press
on
more
courageously
more
confidently
with
her
face
set
more
firmly
toward
the
goal
chapter
xviii
the
goal
what
is
the
goal
of
woman
upward
struggle
is
it
voluntary
motherhood
is
it
general
freedom
or
is
it
the
birth
of
a
new
race
for
freedom
is
not
fruitless
but
prolific
of
higher
things
being
the
most
sacred
aspect
of
woman
freedom
voluntary
motherhood
is
motherhood
in
its
highest
and
holiest
form
it
is
motherhood
unchained
motherhood
ready
to
obey
its
own
urge
to
remake
the
world
voluntary
motherhood
implies
a
new
morality
a
vigorous
constructive
liberated
morality
that
morality
will
first
of
all
prevent
the
submergence
of
womanhood
into
motherhood
it
will
set
its
face
against
the
conversion
of
women
into
mechanical
maternity
and
toward
the
creation
of
a
new
race
woman
r√¥le
has
been
that
of
an
incubator
and
little
more
she
has
given
birth
to
an
incubated
race
she
has
given
to
her
children
what
little
she
was
permitted
to
give
but
of
herself
of
her
personality
almost
nothing
in
the
mass
she
has
brought
forth
quantity
not
quality
the
requirement
of
a
male
dominated
civilization
has
been
numbers
she
has
met
that
requirement
it
is
the
essential
function
of
voluntary
motherhood
to
choose
its
own
mate
to
determine
the
time
of
childbearing
and
to
regulate
strictly
the
number
of
offspring
natural
affection
upon
her
part
instead
of
selection
dictated
by
social
or
economic
advantage
will
give
her
a
better
fatherhood
for
her
children
the
exercise
of
her
right
to
decide
how
many
children
she
will
have
and
when
she
shall
have
them
will
procure
for
her
the
time
necessary
to
the
development
of
other
faculties
than
that
of
reproduction
she
will
give
play
to
her
tastes
her
talents
and
her
ambitions
she
will
become
a
human
being
thus
and
only
thus
will
woman
be
able
to
transmit
to
her
offspring
those
qualities
which
make
for
a
greater
race
the
importance
of
developing
these
qualities
in
the
mothers
for
transmission
to
the
children
is
apparent
when
we
recall
certain
principles
of
biology
in
all
of
the
animal
species
below
the
human
motherhood
has
a
clearly
discernible
superiority
over
fatherhood
it
is
the
first
pulse
of
organic
life
fatherhood
is
the
fertilizing
element
its
development
compared
to
that
of
the
mother
cell
is
comparatively
new
likewise
its
influence
upon
the
progeny
is
comparatively
small
there
are
weighty
authorities
who
assert
that
through
the
female
alone
comes
those
modifications
of
form
capacity
and
ability
which
constitute
evolutionary
progress
it
was
the
mothers
who
first
developed
cunning
in
chase
ingenuity
in
escaping
enemies
skill
in
obtaining
food
and
adaptability
it
was
they
also
who
attained
unfailing
discretion
in
leadership
adaptation
to
environment
and
boldness
in
attack
when
the
animal
kingdom
as
a
whole
is
surveyed
these
stand
out
as
distinctly
feminine
traits
they
stand
out
also
as
the
characteristics
by
which
the
progress
of
species
is
measured
why
is
all
this
true
of
the
lower
species
yet
not
true
of
human
beings
the
secret
is
revealed
by
one
significant
fact
the
functions
in
these
animal
species
are
not
limited
to
motherhood
alone
every
organ
and
faculty
is
fully
employed
and
perfected
through
the
development
of
the
individual
mother
better
and
higher
types
of
animals
are
produced
and
carried
forward
in
a
word
natural
law
makes
the
female
the
expression
and
the
conveyor
of
racial
efficiency
birth
control
itself
often
denounced
as
a
violation
of
natural
law
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
the
facilitation
of
the
process
of
weeding
out
the
unfit
of
preventing
the
birth
of
defectives
or
of
those
who
will
become
defectives
so
in
compliance
with
working
plan
we
must
permit
womanhood
its
full
development
before
we
can
expect
of
it
efficient
motherhood
if
we
are
to
make
racial
progress
this
development
of
womanhood
must
precede
motherhood
in
every
individual
woman
then
and
then
only
can
the
mother
cease
to
be
an
incubator
and
be
a
mother
indeed
then
only
can
she
transmit
to
her
sons
and
daughters
the
qualities
which
make
strong
individuals
and
collectively
a
strong
race
voluntary
motherhood
also
implies
the
right
of
marriage
without
maternity
two
utterly
different
functions
are
developed
in
the
two
relationships
in
order
to
give
the
mate
relationship
its
full
and
free
play
it
is
necessary
that
no
woman
should
be
a
mother
against
her
will
there
are
other
reasons
of
course
reasons
more
frequently
emphasized
but
the
reason
just
mentioned
should
never
be
overlooked
it
is
as
important
to
the
race
as
to
the
woman
for
through
it
is
developed
that
high
love
impulse
which
conveyed
to
the
child
attunes
and
perfects
its
being
marriage
quite
aside
from
parentage
also
gives
two
people
invaluable
experience
when
parentage
follows
in
its
proper
time
it
is
a
better
parentage
because
of
the
mutual
adjustment
and
development
because
of
the
knowledge
thus
gained
few
couples
are
fitted
to
understand
the
sacred
mystery
of
child
life
until
they
have
solved
some
of
the
problems
arising
out
of
their
own
love
lives
maternal
love
which
usually
follows
upon
a
happy
satisfying
mate
love
becomes
a
strong
and
urgent
craving
it
then
exists
for
two
powerful
creative
functions
first
for
its
own
sake
and
then
for
the
sake
of
further
enriching
the
conjugal
relationship
it
is
from
such
soil
that
the
new
life
should
spring
it
is
the
inherent
right
of
the
new
life
to
have
its
inception
in
such
physical
ground
in
such
spiritual
atmosphere
the
child
thus
born
is
indeed
a
flower
of
love
and
tremendous
joy
it
has
within
it
the
seeds
of
courage
and
of
power
this
child
will
have
the
greatest
strength
to
surmount
hardships
to
withstand
tyrannies
to
set
still
higher
the
mark
of
human
achievement
shall
we
pause
here
to
speak
again
of
the
rights
of
womanhood
in
itself
and
of
itself
to
be
absolutely
free
we
have
talked
of
this
right
so
much
in
these
pages
only
to
learn
that
in
the
end
a
free
womanhood
turns
of
its
own
desire
to
a
free
and
happy
motherhood
a
motherhood
which
does
not
submerge
the
woman
but
which
is
enriched
because
she
is
unsubmerged
when
we
voice
then
the
necessity
of
setting
the
feminine
spirit
utterly
and
absolutely
free
thought
turns
naturally
not
to
rights
of
the
woman
nor
indeed
of
the
mother
but
to
the
rights
of
the
child
of
all
children
in
the
world
for
this
is
the
miracle
of
free
womanhood
that
in
its
freedom
it
becomes
the
race
mother
and
opens
its
heart
in
fruitful
affection
for
humanity
how
narrow
how
pitifully
puny
has
become
motherhood
in
its
chains
the
modern
motherhood
enfolds
one
or
two
adoring
children
of
its
own
blood
and
cherishes
protects
and
loves
them
it
does
not
reach
out
to
all
children
when
motherhood
is
a
high
privilege
not
a
sordid
slavish
requirement
it
will
encircle
all
its
deep
passionate
intensity
will
overflow
the
limits
of
blood
relationship
its
beauty
will
shine
upon
all
for
its
beauty
is
of
the
soul
whose
power
of
enfoldment
is
unbounded
when
motherhood
becomes
the
fruit
of
a
deep
yearning
not
the
result
of
ignorance
or
accident
its
children
will
become
the
foundation
of
a
new
race
there
will
be
no
killing
of
babies
in
the
womb
by
abortion
nor
through
neglect
in
foundling
homes
nor
will
there
be
infanticide
neither
will
children
die
by
inches
in
mills
and
factories
no
man
will
dare
to
break
a
child
life
upon
the
wheel
of
toil
voluntary
motherhood
will
not
be
passive
resigned
or
weak
out
of
its
craving
will
come
forth
a
fierceness
of
love
for
its
fruits
that
will
make
such
men
as
remain
unawakened
stand
aghast
at
its
fury
when
offended
the
tigress
is
less
terrible
in
defense
of
her
offspring
than
will
be
the
human
mother
the
daughters
of
such
women
will
not
be
given
over
to
injustice
and
to
prostitution
the
sons
will
not
perish
in
industry
nor
upon
the
battle
field
nor
could
they
meet
these
all
too
common
fates
if
an
undaunted
motherhood
were
there
to
defend
childhood
and
youth
will
be
too
valuable
in
the
eyes
of
society
to
waste
them
in
the
murderous
mills
of
blind
greed
and
hate
this
is
the
dawn
womanhood
shakes
off
its
bondage
it
asserts
its
right
to
be
free
in
its
freedom
its
thoughts
turn
to
the
race
like
begets
like
we
gather
perfect
fruit
from
perfect
trees
the
race
is
but
the
amplification
of
its
mother
body
the
multiplication
of
flesh
habitations
beautified
and
perfected
for
souls
akin
to
the
mother
soul
the
relentless
efforts
of
reactionary
authority
to
suppress
the
message
of
birth
control
and
of
voluntary
motherhood
are
futile
the
powers
of
reaction
can
not
now
prevent
the
feminine
spirit
from
breaking
its
bonds
when
the
last
fetter
falls
the
evils
that
have
resulted
from
the
suppression
of
woman
will
to
freedom
will
pass
child
slavery
prostitution
feeblemindedness
physical
deterioration
hunger
oppression
and
war
will
disappear
from
the
earth
in
their
subjection
women
have
not
been
brave
enough
strong
enough
pure
enough
to
bring
forth
great
sons
and
daughters
abused
soil
brings
forth
stunted
growths
an
abused
motherhood
has
brought
forth
a
low
order
of
humanity
great
beings
come
forth
at
the
call
of
high
desire
fearless
motherhood
goes
out
in
love
and
passion
for
justice
to
all
mankind
it
brings
forth
fruits
after
its
own
kind
when
the
womb
becomes
fruitful
through
the
desire
of
an
aspiring
love
another
newton
will
come
forth
to

the
