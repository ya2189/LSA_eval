preface
let
it
be
made
clear
at
the
very
outset
of
this
preface
that
the
pages
which
follow
do
not
pretend
to
be
a
history
of
piracy
but
are
simply
an
attempt
to
gather
together
from
various
sources
particulars
of
those
redoubtable
pirates
and
buccaneers
whose
names
have
been
handed
down
to
us
in
a
desultory
way
i
do
not
deal
here
with
the
children
of
fancy
i
believe
that
every
man
or
woman
too
since
certain
of
the
gentler
sex
cut
no
small
figure
at
the
game
mentioned
in
this
volume
actually
existed
a
time
has
come
when
every
form
of
learning
however
preposterous
it
may
seem
is
made
as
unlaborious
as
possible
for
the
student
knowledge
which
is
after
all
but
a
string
of
facts
is
being
arranged
sorted
distilled
and
set
down
in
compact
form
ready
for
rapid
assimilation
there
is
little
fear
that
the
student
who
may
wish
in
the
future
to
become
master
of
any
subject
will
have
to
delve
into
the
original
sources
in
his
search
after
facts
and
dates
surely
pirates
taking
them
in
their
broadest
sense
are
as
much
entitled
to
a
biographical
dictionary
of
their
own
as
are
clergymen
or
artists
in
who
all
i
am
assured
have
their
own
who
have
not
the
medical
men
their
directory
the
lawyers
their
list
the
peers
their
peerage
there
are
books
which
record
the
names
and
the
particulars
of
musicians
schoolmasters
stockbrokers
saints
and
bookmakers
and
i
dare
say
there
is
an
average
adjuster
almanac
a
peer
a
horse
dog
cat
and
even
a
white
mouse
if
of
blood
sufficiently
blue
has
his
pedigree
recorded
somewhere
above
all
there
is
that
astounding
and
entertaining
volume
who
who
found
in
every
club
and
which
grows
more
bulky
year
by
year
stuffed
with
information
about
the
careers
the
hobbies
and
the
marriages
of
all
the
most
distinguished
persons
in
every
profession
including
very
full
details
about
the
lives
and
doings
of
all
our
journalists
but
on
the
club
table
where
these
books
of
ready
reference
stand
with
whitaker
abc
and
ruff
guide
to
the
turf
there
is
just
one
gap
that
the
compiler
of
this
work
has
for
a
long
while
felt
sorely
needed
filling
there
has
been
until
now
no
work
that
gives
immediate
and
trustworthy
information
about
the
lives
and
so
sadly
important
in
their
cases
the
deaths
of
our
pirates
and
buccaneers
in
delving
in
the
volumes
of
the
dictionary
of
national
biography
it
has
been
a
sad
disappointment
to
the
writer
to
find
so
little
space
devoted
to
the
careers
of
these
picturesque
if
i
must
admit
often
unseemly
persons
there
are
of
course
to
be
found
a
few
pirates
with
household
names
such
as
kidd
teach
and
avery
a
few
too
of
the
buccaneers
headed
by
the
great
sir
henry
morgan
come
in
for
their
share
but
i
compare
with
indignation
the
meagre
show
of
pirates
in
that
monumental
work
with
the
rich
profusion
of
divines
even
during
the
years
when
piracy
was
at
its
height
say
from
until
the
pirates
are
utterly
swamped
by
the
theologians
can
it
be
that
these
two
professions
flourished
most
vigorously
side
by
side
and
that
when
one
began
to
languish
the
other
also
began
to
fade
even
so
there
can
be
no
excuse
for
the
past
and
present
neglect
of
these
but
a
change
is
beginning
to
show
itself
increasing
evidence
is
to
be
found
that
the
more
intelligent
portions
of
the
population
of
this
country
and
even
more
so
the
enlightened
of
the
great
united
states
of
america
are
beginning
to
show
a
proper
interest
in
the
lives
of
the
pirates
and
buccaneers
that
this
should
be
so
amongst
the
americans
is
quite
natural
when
it
is
remembered
what
a
close
intimacy
existed
between
their
puritan
forefathers
of
new
england
and
the
pirates
both
by
blood
relation
and
by
trade
since
the
pirates
had
no
more
obliging
and
ready
customers
for
their
spoils
of
gold
dust
stolen
slaves
or
church
ornaments
than
the
early
settlers
of
new
york
massachusetts
and
carolina
in
beginning
to
compile
such
a
list
as
is
to
be
found
in
this
volume
a
difficulty
is
met
at
once
my
original
intention
was
that
only
pirates
and
buccaneers
should
be
included
to
admit
privateers
corsairs
and
other
would
have
meant
the
addition
of
a
vast
number
of
names
and
would
have
made
the
work
unwieldy
and
the
very
object
of
this
volume
as
a
book
of
ready
reference
would
not
have
been
achieved
but
the
difficulty
has
been
to
define
the
exact
meaning
of
a
pirate
and
of
a
buccaneer
in
the
dictionary
a
pirate
is
defined
as
a
marauder
one
who
infringes
another
copyright
while
a
buccaneer
is
described
as
a
a
pirate
especially
of
the
coasts
this
seems
explicit
but
a
pirate
was
not
a
pirate
from
the
cradle
to
the
gallows
he
usually
began
his
life
at
sea
as
an
honest
mariner
in
the
merchant
service
he
perhaps
mutinied
with
other
of
the
ship
crew
killed
or
otherwise
disposed
of
the
captain
seized
the
ship
elected
a
new
commander
and
sailed
off
on
the
account
many
an
honest
seaman
was
captured
with
the
rest
of
his
ship
crew
by
a
pirate
and
either
voluntarily
joined
the
freebooters
by
signing
their
articles
or
being
a
good
navigator
or
was
compelled
by
the
pirates
to
lend
them
his
services
others
again
were
in
privateer
ships
which
carried
on
a
legitimate
warfare
against
the
shipping
of
hostile
countries
under
a
commission
or
letter
of
marque
often
the
very
commission
or
letter
of
marque
carried
about
so
jealously
by
some
shady
privateer
was
not
worth
the
paper
it
was
written
on
nor
the
handful
of
dubloons
paid
for
it
one
buccaneer
sailed
about
the
south
seas
plundering
spanish
ships
and
sacking
churches
and
burning
towns
under
a
commission
issued
to
him
for
a
consideration
by
the
governor
of
a
danish
west
india
island
himself
an
this
precious
document
adorned
with
florid
scrolls
and
a
big
impressive
seal
was
written
in
danish
someone
with
a
knowledge
of
that
language
had
an
opportunity
and
the
curiosity
to
translate
it
when
he
found
that
all
it
entitled
the
bearer
to
do
was
to
hunt
for
goats
and
pigs
on
the
island
of
hispaniola
and
nothing
more
when
at
the
conclusion
of
hostilities
peace
was
declared
the
crew
of
a
privateer
found
it
exceedingly
irksome
to
give
up
the
roving
life
and
were
liable
to
drift
into
piracy
often
it
happened
that
after
a
long
naval
war
crews
were
disbanded
ships
laid
up
and
navies
reduced
thus
flooding
the
countryside
with
idle
mariners
and
filling
the
roads
with
begging
and
starving
seamen
these
were
driven
to
go
to
sea
if
they
could
find
a
berth
often
half
starved
and
brutally
treated
and
always
underpaid
and
so
easily
yielded
to
the
temptation
of
joining
some
vessel
bound
vaguely
for
the
south
sea
where
no
questions
were
asked
and
no
wages
paid
but
every
hand
on
board
had
a
share
in
the
adventure
the
buccaneers
were
a
great
source
of
piracy
also
when
a
war
was
on
hand
the
english
government
was
only
too
glad
to
have
the
help
of
these
daring
and
skilful
seamen
but
when
peace
was
declared
these
allies
began
to
lead
to
international
complications
and
means
had
to
be
taken
to
abolish
them
and
to
try
and
turn
them
into
honest
settlers
in
the
islands
but
when
a
man
has
for
years
lived
the
free
life
sailed
out
from
jamaica
a
pauper
to
return
in
six
weeks
or
less
with
perhaps
a
bag
of
gold
worth
two
three
or
four
thousand
pounds
which
he
has
prided
himself
on
spending
in
the
taverns
and
of
port
royal
in
a
week
how
can
he
settle
down
to
humdrum
uneventful
toil
with
its
small
profits
thus
he
goes
back
on
the
account
and
sails
to
some
prearranged
rendezvous
of
the
brethren
of
the
coast
to
write
a
whole
history
of
piracy
would
be
a
great
undertaking
but
a
very
interesting
one
piracy
must
have
begun
in
the
far
dim
ages
and
perhaps
when
some
naked
savage
paddling
himself
across
a
tropical
river
met
with
another
adventurer
on
a
better
or
carrying
a
bigger
bunch
of
bananas
the
first
act
of
piracy
was
committed
indeed
piracy
must
surely
be
the
third
oldest
profession
in
the
world
if
we
give
the
honour
of
the
second
place
to
the
ancient
craft
of
healing
if
such
a
history
were
to
include
the
whole
of
piracy
it
would
have
to
refer
to
the
phoenicians
to
the
mediterranean
of
the
days
of
rome
who
had
they
but
known
it
held
the
future
destiny
of
the
world
in
their
grasp
when
they
a
handful
of
pirates
took
prisoner
the
young
julius
c√¶sar
to
ransom
him
and
afterwards
to
be
caught
and
crucified
by
him
the
arabs
in
the
red
sea
were
for
many
years
of
the
art
of
piracy
as
were
the
barbary
corsairs
of
algiers
and
tunis
who
made
the
mediterranean
a
place
of
danger
for
many
generations
of
seamen
all
this
while
the
chinese
and
malays
were
active
pirates
while
the
pirate
coast
of
the
persian
gulf
was
feared
by
all
mariners
then
arose
the
great
period
beginning
in
the
reign
of
henry
advancing
with
rapid
strides
during
the
adventurous
years
of
queen
elizabeth
when
many
west
of
england
squires
were
wont
to
sell
their
estates
and
invest
all
in
a
ship
in
which
to
go
cruising
on
the
spanish
main
in
the
hope
of
taking
a
rich
spanish
galleon
homeward
bound
from
cartagena
and
porto
bello
deep
laden
with
the
riches
of
peru
and
mexico
out
of
these
adventurers
developed
the
buccaneers
a
ruffianly
lot
who
feared
neither
god
man
nor
death
by
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
piracy
was
on
the
wane
and
practically
had
died
out
by
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
the
final
thrust
that
destroyed
it
being
given
by
the
american
and
english
navies
in
the
north
atlantic
and
west
indian
seas
but
by
this
time
piracy
had
degenerated
to
mere
the
days
of
gallant
and
ruthless
had
passed
and
the
pirate
of
those
decadent
days
was
generally
a
with
no
courage
a
mere
robber
and
murderer
the
advent
of
the
telegraph
and
of
ships
settled
for
ever
the
account
of
the
pirates
except
in
china
when
even
to
this
day
accounts
reach
us
through
the
press
of
piratical
enterprises
but
never
again
will
the
black
craft
of
the
pirate
with
the
jolly
roger
flying
be
liable
to
pounce
down
upon
the
unsuspecting
and
harmless
merchantman
the
books
devoted
to
the
lives
and
exploits
of
buccaneers
and
pirates
are
few
indeed
but
two
stand
out
prominently
both
masterpieces
of
their
kind
one
the
bucaniers
of
america
or
a
true
account
of
the
most
remarkable
assaults
committed
of
late
years
upon
the
coasts
of
the
west
indies
was
written
by
a
to
the
buccaneers
exquemelin
a
dutchman
and
was
published
at
amsterdam
in
many
translations
were
made
the
first
one
in
english
being
published
in
by
william
crooke
at
the
green
dragon
without
temple
bar
in
london
the
publication
of
this
book
was
the
cause
of
a
libel
action
brought
by
sir
henry
morgan
against
the
publisher
the
buccaneer
commander
won
his
case
and
was
granted
damages
and
a
public
apology
in
this
book
morgan
was
held
up
as
a
perfect
monster
for
his
cruel
treatment
to
his
prisoners
but
although
morgan
resented
this
very
much
the
statement
that
annoyed
him
much
more
was
that
which
told
the
reader
that
morgan
came
of
very
humble
stock
and
was
sold
by
his
parents
when
a
boy
to
serve
as
a
labourer
in
barbadoes
the
greatest
work
on
pirates
was
written
in
by
captain
charles
johnson
the
original
edition
now
exceedingly
rare
is
called
a
general
history
of
the
pyrates
from
their
first
rise
and
settlement
in
the
island
of
providence
to
the
present
time
and
is
illustrated
by
interesting
engravings
another
edition
in
is
a
handsome
folio
called
a
general
history
of
the
lives
and
adventures
of
the
most
famous
highwaymen
to
which
is
added
a
genuine
account
of
the
voyages
and
plunders
of
the
most
notorious
pyrates
and
contains
many
copperplates
by
basire
and
others
the
pirates
are
given
only
a
share
in
the
pages
of
this
book
but
it
has
some
very
fine
engravings
of
such
famous
pirates
as
avery
roberts
low
lowther
and
blackbeard
the
third
edition
of
the
history
of
pirates
of
has
a
quaint
frontispiece
showing
the
two
women
pirates
anne
bonny
and
mary
read
in
action
with
their
swords
drawn
upon
the
deck
of
a
ship
while
the
fourth
edition
published
in
in
two
volumes
contains
the
stories
of
the
less
rovers
after
studying
the
subject
of
piracy
at
all
closely
one
can
not
but
be
struck
by
the
number
of
pirates
who
came
from
wales
welshmen
figure
not
only
amongst
the
rank
and
file
but
amongst
the
leaders
morgan
of
course
stands
head
and
shoulders
above
the
rest
it
is
curious
how
certain
races
show
particular
adaptability
for
certain
callings
up
to
two
hundred
years
ago
the
chief
pirates
were
welshmen
most
of
our
haberdashers
hail
from
the
same
land
of
the
leek
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
and
fathom
the
reason
why
these
two
callings
at
first
sight
so
dissimilar
should
call
forth
the
qualities
in
a
particular
race
perhaps
some
of
our
leading
haberdashers
and
linen
drapers
will
be
willing
to
supply
the
answer
i
sometimes
wonder
what
happens
to
the
modern
pirates
i
mean
the
men
who
had
they
lived
years
ago
would
have
been
pirates
what
do
they
find
to
exercise
their
undoubted
if
unsocial
talents
and
energies
many
i
think
find
openings
of
an
adventurous
financial
kind
in
the
city
politics
again
surely
has
its
buccaneers
one
can
imagine
for
example
some
leading
modern
politician
let
us
say
a
welshman
who
like
morgan
being
a
brilliant
public
speaker
is
able
by
his
eloquence
to
sway
vast
crowds
of
listeners
whether
buccaneers
or
electors
a
man
of
quick
and
subtle
mind
able
to
recognize
and
seize
upon
the
main
chance
perfectly
ruthless
in
his
methods
when
necessity
requires
and
one
who
having
achieved
the
goal
on
which
he
had
set
his
ambition
discards
his
party
or
followers
as
morgan
did
his
buccaneers
after
the
sacking
of
panama
nor
is
europe
without
a
counterpart
to
the
ruffian
crews
who
arrogantly
defied
the
world
and
declared
war
on
all
nations
one
great
difficulty
which
the
author
of
this
work
is
met
with
is
to
decide
who
was
and
who
was
not
a
pirate
certain
friends
who
have
taken
a
kindly
if
somewhat
frivolous
interest
in
the
compilation
of
this
work
have
inquired
if
sir
francis
drake
was
to
be
included
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
question
is
not
an
easy
one
to
answer
the
most
fervent
patriot
must
admit
that
the
early
voyages
of
drake
were
to
put
it
mildly
of
a
buccaneering
kind
although
his
late
voyages
were
more
nearly
akin
to
privateering
cruises
than
piracy
but
if
during
the
reign
of
king
philip
a
spaniard
had
been
asked
if
drake
was
a
pirate
he
would
certainly
have
answered
yes
and
that
without
any
hesitation
whatever
so
much
depends
upon
the
point
of
view
in
the
edition
of
johnson
history
of
highwaymen
and
pirates
the
famous
paul
jones
holds
a
prominent
place
as
a
pirate
and
is
described
in
no
half
measures
as
a
traitor
yet
i
doubt
if
in
the
schools
of
america
the
rising
young
citizens
of
god
own
country
are
told
any
such
thing
but
are
probably
and
quite
naturally
taught
to
look
upon
paul
jones
as
a
true
patriot
and
a
brave
sailor
again
there
is
christopher
columbus
the
greatest
of
all
explorers
about
whom
no
breath
of
scandal
in
the
piratical
way
was
ever
breathed
who
only
escaped
being
a
pirate
by
the
fact
that
his
was
the
first
ship
to
sail
in
the
caribbean
sea
for
there
is
little
doubt
that
had
the
great
navigator
found
an
english
ship
lying
at
anchor
when
he
first
arrived
at
the
island
of
san
salvador
an
act
of
piracy
would
have
immediately
taken
place
for
the
student
who
is
interested
there
are
other
writers
who
have
dealt
with
the
subject
of
piracy
such
as
the
buccaneers
ringrose
cooke
funnell
dampier
and
cowley
woodes
rogers
with
his
voyage
to
the
south
seas
wafer
who
wrote
an
amusing
little
book
in
describing
his
hardships
and
adventures
on
the
isthmus
of
darien
of
modern
writers
may
be
recommended
john
masefield
spanish
main
the
buccaneers
in
the
west
indies
by
haring
and
the
latest
publication
of
the
marine
research
society
of
massachusetts
entitled
the
pirates
of
the
new
england
coast
and
last
but
far
from
least
the
works
of
hyatt
verrill
the
conditions
of
life
on
a
pirate
ship
appear
to
have
been
much
the
same
in
all
vessels
on
procuring
a
craft
by
stealing
or
by
mutiny
of
the
crew
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
elect
a
commander
this
was
done
by
vote
amongst
the
crew
who
elected
whoever
they
considered
the
most
daring
amongst
them
and
the
best
navigator
the
next
officer
chosen
was
the
quartermaster
the
captain
and
quartermaster
once
elected
the
former
could
appoint
any
junior
officers
he
chose
and
the
shares
in
any
plunder
they
took
was
divided
according
to
the
rank
of
each
pirate
the
crew
were
then
searched
for
a
pirate
who
could
write
and
when
found
this
scholar
would
be
taken
down
to
the
great
cabin
given
pen
ink
and
paper
and
after
the
articles
had
been
discussed
and
decided
upon
they
were
written
down
to
be
signed
by
each
member
of
the
crew
as
an
example
the
articles
drawn
up
by
the
crew
of
captain
john
phillips
on
board
the
are
given
below
in

every

one

if
any

shall

to
the
value
of
a
piece
of

he
shall
be

or

if
at
any
time
we
should
meet
another
marrooner
that

that
man
that
shall
sign
his
articles
without
the
consent
of
our
company
shall
suffer
such
punishment
as
the
captain
and
company
shall
think
fit
that
man
that
shall
strike
another
whilst
these
articles
are
in
force
shall
receive
moses
law
that
is

lacking

smoak
tobacco
in
the
hold
without
a
cap
to
his
pipe
or
carry
a
candle
lighted
without
a
lanthorn
shall
suffer
the
same
punishment
as
in
the
former
article
that
man
that
shall
not
keep
his
arms
clean
fit
for
an
engagement
or
neglect
his
business
shall
be
cut
off
from
his

and
suffer
such
other
punishment
as
the
captain
and
the

shall

shall
lose
a

of

you
meet
with
a
prudent
woman
that
man
that
offers
to
meddle
with
her
without
her
consent
shall
suffer
present
death
these
formalities
took
time
and
much
argument
and
the
drinking
of
many
bowls
of
punch
and
when
once
settled
the
next
business
was
to
make
a
flag
the
jolly
roger
consisting
of
a
human
skull
and
two
crossed
was
generally
portrayed
in
black
and
white
some
crews
preferred
a
study
in
red
and
white
more
enterprising
captains
with
imagination
and
taste
such
as
captain
bartholomew
roberts
who
was
a
truly
remarkable
man
and
the
greatest
pirate
who
ever
declared
war
upon
all
the
world
aimed
at
something
more
elaborate
roberts
flew
several
flags
all
made
to
his
own
design
on
one
was
depicted
a
human
anatomy
holding
a
rummer
or
glass
of
punch
in
one
bony
hand
and
a
flaming
sword
in
the
other
another
favourite
flag
of
roberts
had
a
huge
portrait
of
himself
sword
in
hand
and
two
skulls
another
had
a
skellington
standing
with
either
foot
firmly
placed
on
a
skull
and
under
one
skull
were
embroidered
the
letters
under
the
other
which
letters
stood
for
a
barbadian
head
and
a
martinican
head
to
warn
any
inhabitant
of
either
of
these
islands
what
to
expect
if
he
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
be
taken
prisoner
by
bartholomew
who
never
forgot
nor
forgave
two
occasions
on
which
he
was
very
roughly
handled
by
ships
from
barbadoes
and
martinique
the
weak
point
in
all
pirate
ships
was
the
lack
of
discipline
time
and
again
some
successful
enterprise
almost
completed
was
thrown
away
by
lack
of
discipline
no
captain
could
be
certain
of
his
command
or
crew
if
he
did
anything
they
disapproved
of
the
crew
would
throw
him
in
chains
into
the
hold
or
as
likely
overboard
and
elect
another
it
is
on
record
that
one
ship
had
elected
thirteen
different
commanders
in
a
few
months
some
of
the
big
men
retained
their
commands
roberts
holding
the
record
for
a
pirate
of
four
years
until
his
death
while
bartholomew
sharp
holds
the
record
for
a
buccaneer
having
procured
a
vessel
perhaps
little
more
than
a
sometimes
only
an
open
the
embryo
pirates
would
paddle
along
some
coast
until
they
came
across
an
unsuspecting
craft
one
not
too
big
for
the
desperadoes
to
attack
hiding
their
arms
they
would
row
alongside
and
then
suddenly
with
shouts
and
curses
board
the
vessel
kill
any
who
resisted
and
start
a
cruise
in
their
new
ship
their
number
being
increased
by
volunteers
or
forced
men
from
amongst
the
prize
crew
cruising
thus
the
pirates
would
gradually
get
together
a
small
fleet
of
the
fastest
and
best
sailing
vessels
among
their
prizes
and
increase
their
crew
as
they
went
along
both
the
buccaneers
and
the
pirates
had
their
favourite
haunts
and
places
of
rendezvous
these
had
to
be
within
easy
sailing
distance
of
one
or
more
regular
trade
routes
and
at
the
same
time
had
to
be
in
some
quiet
spot
unlikely
to
be
visited
by
strange
craft
and
besides
being
sheltered
from
storms
must
have
a
suitable
beach
on
which
their
vessels
could
be
careened
and
the
hulls
scraped
of
barnacles
and
weeds
the
greatest
stronghold
of
the
buccaneers
was
at
tortuga
or
turtle
island
a
small
island
lying
off
the
west
coast
of
hispaniola
here
in
their
most
piping
days
flourished
a
buccaneer
republic
where
the
seamen
made
their
own
laws
and
cultivated
the
land
for
and
yams
occasionally
the
spaniards
or
the
french
without
any
warning
would
swoop
down
on
the
settlement
and
break
up
the
small
republic
but
sooner
or
later
the
buccaneers
would
be
back
once
again
in
possession
the
favourite
and
most
flourishing
headquarters
of
the
west
india
pirates
was
at
new
providence
island
in
the
bahama
islands
occupied
by
the
flourishing
town
of
nassau
now
the
headquarters
of
those
worthy
descendants
of
the
pirates
the
bootleggers
who
from
the
old
port
carry
on
their
exciting
and
profitable
smuggling
of
whisky
into
the
united
states
the
numerous
bays
and
islands
lying
off
the
coast
of
south
carolina
were
very
popular
with
the
free
booters
in
the
late
seventeenth
and
early
eighteenth
centuries
while
port
royal
in
jamaica
was
noted
from
early
days
as
the
port
from
which
the
most
famous
buccaneers
sailed
for
the
spanish
main
and
to
which
they
returned
with
their
plunder
the
french
filibusters
and
pirates
mostly
used
the
virgin
islands
while
the
dutch
patronized
their
own
islands
of
cura√ßao
saba
and
eustatius
but
the
buccaneers
did
not
allow
the
chance
of
nationality
to
divide
them
for
frenchmen
englishmen
and
dutchmen
all
brethren
of
the
coast
sailed
together
and
plundered
the
spaniard
in
open
and
equal
friendship
an
entirely
different
group
of
pirates
arose
in
the
south
seas
with
their
headquarters
in
madagascar
here
the
pirates
went
farther
towards
forming
a
permanent
society
than
at
any
other
time
during
their
history
with
the
exception
of
the
barbary
corsairs
who
had
their
strongly
fortified
settlements
for
many
years
at
algiers
tunis
and
sallee
the
origin
of
the
buccaneers
is
interesting
and
i
can
not
do
better
than
quote
the
opening
chapter
of
clark
russell
life
of
william
dampier
in
the
english
men
of
action
series
published
by
macmillan
in
he
writes
in
or
about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
island
of
san
domingo
or
hispaniola
as
it
was
then
called
was
haunted
and
overrun
by
a
singular
community
of
savage
surly
fierce
and
filthy
men
they
were
chiefly
composed
of
french
colonists
whose
ranks
had
from
time
to
time
been
enlarged
by
liberal
contributions
from
the
slums
and
alleys
of
more
than
one
european
city
and
town
these
people
went
dressed
in
shirts
and
pantaloons
of
coarse
linen
cloth
which
they
steeped
in
the
blood
of
the
animals
they
slaughtered
they
wore
round
caps
boots
of
hogskin
drawn
over
their
naked
feet
and
belts
of
raw
hide
in
which
they
stuck
their
sabres
and
knives
they
also
armed
themselves
with
firelocks
which
threw
a
couple
of
balls
each
weighing
two
ounces
the
places
where
they
dried
and
salted
their
meat
were
called
and
from
this
term
they
came
to
be
styled
bucaniers
or
buccaneers
as
we
spell
it
they
were
hunters
by
trade
and
savages
in
their
habits
they
chased
and
slaughtered
horned
cattle
and
trafficked
with
the
flesh
and
their
favourite
food
was
raw
marrow
from
the
bones
of
the
beasts
which
they
shot
they
ate
and
slept
on
the
ground
their
table
was
a
stone
their
bolster
the
trunk
of
a
tree
and
their
roof
the
hot
and
sparkling
heavens
of
the
antilles
the
spaniards
who
were
jealous
of
any
other
nation
than
their
own
having
a
foothold
in
america
determined
to
get
rid
of
these
wild
but
hitherto
harmless
buccaneers
this
they
accomplished
and
in
time
drove
the
out
of
hispaniola
and
to
make
sure
that
the
unwelcome
visitors
should
not
return
they
exterminated
all
the
wild
cattle
this
was
the
worst
mistake
the
spaniards
could
have
made
for
these
wild
men
had
to
look
for
other
means
of
supporting
themselves
and
they
joined
the
freebooters
and
thus
began
the
great
period
of
piracy
which
was
the
cause
of
the
ultimate
of
the
spanish
power
in
the
west
indies
of
the
life
on
board
buccaneer
and
pirate
ships
a
somewhat
hazy
and
incomplete
picture
reaches
us
the
crews
were
usually
large
compared
with
the
number
of
men
carried
in
other
ships
and
a
state
of
crowded
discomfort
must
have
been
the
result
especially
in
some
crazy
old
vessel
cruising
in
the
tropics
or
rounding
the
horn
in
winter
of
the
relationship
between
the
and
the
fair
sex
it
would
be
best
perhaps
to
draw
a
discreet
veil
the
pirates
and
the
buccaneers
looked
upon
women
simply
as
the
spoils
of
war
and
were
as
profligate
with
these
as
with
the
rest
of
their
plunder
i
do
not
know
if
i
am
disclosing
a
secret
when
i
mention
that
my
friend
hyatt
verrill
who
is
an
authority
on
the
subject
of
the
lives
of
the
pirates
is
about
to
publish
a
book
devoted
to
the
love
affairs
of
these
gentry
i
confess
to
looking
forward
with
pleasure
and
a
certain
degree
of
trepidation
to
reading
his
book
and
to
seeing
how
he
will
deal
with
so
delicate
a
subject
we
know
that
sir
henry
morgan
was
married
and
provided
for
his
widow
in
his
will
captain
kidd
wife
and
child
resided
in
new
york
in
the
utmost
conjugal
happiness
and
respectability
but
then
kidd
was
a
martyr
and
no
pirate
captain
rackam
the
dashing
calico
jack
ran
away
to
sea
with
the
woman
pirate
anne
bonny
and
they
lived
together
happily
on
board
ship
and
on
land
as
did
captain
and
cobham
the
only
other
pirate
i
know
of
who
took
a
wife
to
sea
with
him
was
captain
pease
who
flourished
in
a
way
in
the
piratical
but
not
the
matrimonial
sense
in
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
certain
settler
in
new
zealand
in
the
early
days
describes
a
visit
he
paid
to
captain
pease
and
his
family
on
board
that
pirate
handy
little
schooner
lying
at
anchor
in
a
quiet
cove
at
that
island
on
stepping
aboard
the
guest
was
warmly
welcomed
by
a
short
man
bald
of
head
and
rotund
in
figure
of
about
years
of
age
his
appearance
suggested
a
successful
grocer
rather
than
a
pirate
on
the
deck
were
seated
two
ladies
one
nearing
middle
age
the
other
young
and
undoubtedly
pretty
at
the
feet
of
these
ladies
sprawled
several
small
children
captain
pease
proceeded
to
introduce
his
guest
to
these
as
pease
no
and
pease
no
the
ladies
continued
their
sewing
while
a
conversation
took
place
on
various
subjects
presently
taking
out
his
watch
the
pirate
turned
to
the
younger
lady
observing
that
it
was
nearing
teatime
pease
no
laying
down
her
sewing
went
to
the
cabin
from
which
the
rattle
of
teacups
and
the
hiss
of
a
boiling
kettle
were
soon
heard
tea
being
announced
as
ready
the
party
entered
the
cabin
pease
senior
taking
the
place
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
pouring
out
the
tea
while
the
younger
pease
very
prettily
handed
round
the
cups
and
bread
and
butter
the
guest
particularly
noticing
with
what
respect
and
thoughtfulness
she
looked
after
the
wants
of
the
elder
pease
as
a
pirate
captain
pease
was
second
or
even
third
rate
confining
his
daring
to
seizing
small
unarmed
native
craft
or
robbing
the
stores
of
lonely
white
traders
on
atolls
but
as
a
married
man
he
showed
himself
to
be
a
master
matrimony
was
his
strong
suit
domesticity
his
trump
card
he
gave
one
valuable
hint
to
his
guest
which
was
this
never
take
more
than
two
wives
with
you
on
a
voyage
choose
with
one
is
apt
to
disassociate
serious
matrimony
and
still
less
responsible
paternity
with
the
calling
of
piracy
but
with
captain
pease
this
was
far
from
being
the
case
every
one
of
his
wives
for
he
had
others
on
shore
contributed
her
mite
or
two
to
the
growing
family
and
the
captain
really
could
not
say
which
of
his
offspring
he
was
most
proud
of
it
seems
at
first
strange
that
a
man
of
captain
pease
appearance
figure
and
settled
habits
almost
humdrum
should
have
been
such
an
undoubted
success
with
the
ladies
but
that
he
was
a
success
there
can
be
no
doubt
perhaps
his
calling
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
this
attraction
he
had
for
them
before
bringing
this
preface
to
a
conclusion
there
is
one
other
aspect
of
piracy
upon
which
i
will
touch
death
portrayed
by
a
skeleton

the
device
on
the
flag
beneath
which
they
fought
and
a
skeleton
was
for
ever
threatening
to
emerge
from
its
cupboard
aboard
every
pirate
vessel
the
end
of
most
of
the
pirates
and
a
large
proportion
of
the
buccaneers
was
a
sudden
and
violent
one
and
few
of
them
died
in
their
beds
many
were
killed
in
battle
numbers
of
them
were
drowned
not
a
few
drank
themselves
to
death
with
strong
jamaica
rum
while
many
of
the
buccaneers
died
of
malaria
and
yellow
fever
contracted
in
the
jungles
of
central
america
and
most
of
the
pirates
who
survived
these
perils
lived
only
to
be
hanged
it
is
recorded
of
a
certain
and
pirate
dennis
mccarthy
who
was
about
to
be
hanged
at
new
providence
island
in
that
as
he
stood
on
the
gallows
all
bedecked
with
coloured
ribbons
as
became
a
boxer
he
told
his
admiring
audience
that
his
friends
had
often
in
joke
told
him
he
would
die
in
his
shoes
and
so
to
prove
them
liars
he
kicked
off
his
shoes
amongst
the
crowd
and
so
died
without
them
the
trial
of
a
pirate
was
usually
a
rough
and
ready
business
and
the
culprit
seldom
received
the
benefit
of
any
doubt
that
might
exist
if
he
made
any
defence
at
all
it
was
usually
to
plead
that
he
had
been
forced
to
join
the
pirates
against
his
wish
and
that
he
had
long
been
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
escape
once
condemned
to
death
and
the
date
of
execution
decided
the
prisoner
if
at
newgate
was
handed
over
to
the
good
offices
of
the
prison
ordinary
or
if
in
new
england
to
such
vigorous
apostles
of
christianity
as
the

or
the

mather
the
former
of
these
two
famous
theologians
was
pastor
of
the
north
church
in
boston
and
the
author
of
a
very
rare
work
published
in
called
an
history
of
some
criminals
executed
in
this
land
cotton
mather
preached
many
a
hanging
sermon
to
condemned
pirates
a
few
of
which
can
still
be
read
one
of
these
preached
in
is
called
a
brief
discourse
occasioned
by
a
tragical
spectacle
of
a
number
of
miserables
under
sentence
of
death
for
piracy
the
reverend
doctor
made
a
speciality
of
these
hanging
sermons
and
was
a
thorough
master
of
his
subject
as
is
shown
by
the
following
passage
taken
from
the
above
brief
discourse
the
privateering
stroke
so
easily
degenerates
into
the
piratical
and
the
privateering
trade
is
usually
carried
on
with
an
unchristian
temper
and
proves
an
inlet
unto
so
much
debauchery
and
iniquity
on
the
sunday
previous
to
an
execution
the
condemned
pirates
were
taken
to
church
to
listen
to
a
sermon
while
they
were
exhibited
to
the
crowded
and
gaping
congregation
on
the
day
of
the
execution
a
procession
was
formed
which
marched
from
the
gaol
to
the
gallows
at
the
head
was
carried
a
silver
oar
the
emblem
from
very
early
days
of
a
pirate
execution
arrived
at
the
gibbet
the
prisoner
who
always
dressed
himself
in
his
or
someone
else
best
clothes
would
doff
his
hat
and
make
a
speech
sometimes
the
bolder
spirits
would
speak
in
a
defiant
and
unrepentant
way
but
most
of
them
professed
a
deep
repentance
for
their
sins
and
warned
their
listeners
to
guard
against
the
temptation
of
drink
and
avarice
after
the
prisoner
death
the
bodies
of
the
more
notorious
pirates
were
taken
down
and
hanged
in
chains
at
some
prominent
spot
where
ships
passed
in
order
to
be
a
warning
to
any
mariners
who
had
piratical
leanings
the
number
of
pirates
or
buccaneers
who
died
in
their
beds
must
have
been
very
small
particularly
amongst
the
former
and
i
have
been
able
to
trace
but
a
single
example
of
a
tombstone
marking
the
of
a
pirate
this
is
or
was
until
recently
to
be
found
in
the
graveyard
at

next
prize
was

which
were

cruising
off

he
defeated
a

laden
ship
from

sovereign
he
was
on
friendly
terms
with
but
the
took
this
ship
and
drowned
every
soul
on
board
except
one
woman
who
owing
to
her
great
beauty
he
kept
for
himself
his
next
victim
was
a
malay
praam
which
he
captured
after
a
severe
fight
the
crew
he
shackled
and
threw
overboard
while
he
burnt
the
vessel
paying
another
visit
to

he
caught
the
garrison
unprepared
blew
up
the
fort
and
sailed
off
with
some
sheep
cows
and
pigs
a
few
days
later
the
pirate
seized
an
english
packet
and
after
he
had
tortured
to
death
the
captain
the
terrified
crew
joined
his
service
returning
to
timor
with
his
plunder
he
was
surprised
by
the
arrival
off
the
port
of
guns
which
had
been
sent
to
take
him
slipping
out
of

unobserved
in

his

with
guns
angria
brother
angora
had
been
dethroned
from
the
island
of
timor
by
the
english
government
and
this
had
prevented
the
former
from
all
hope
of
succeeding
as
sultan
owing
to
this
angria
a
very
vindictive
man
nursed
against
the
english
government
a
very
real
grievance
declaring
himself
sultan
of
another
smaller
island
little
timor
he
sailed
out
to
look
for
spoil
his
first
victim
was
the
which
he
took
some
eighty
miles
off
bombay
putting
the
crew
of
men
into
an
open
boat
without
water
and
with
scarcely
room
to
move
he
left
them
it
was
in
the
hottest
month
of
the
year
and
only
of
them
reached
bombay
alive
angria
being
on
the
subject
of
his
new
profession
did
not
limit
himself
to
taking
only
english
vessels
for
meeting
with
two
chinese
junks
laden
with
spices
and
riches
he
plundered
them
both
and
tying
the
crew
back
to
back
threw
them
into
the
sea
to
drown
one
of
the
chinamen
while
watching
his
companions
being
drowned
managed
to
get
a
hand
free
from
his
ropes
and
taking
his
dagger
stabbed
angria
but
missing
his
heart
only
wounded
him
in
the
shoulder
to
punish
him
the
pirate
had
the
skin
cut
off
his
back
and
then
had
him
beaten
with
canes
then
lashing
him
firmly
down
to
a
raft
he
was
thrown
overboard
after
drifting
about
for
three
days
and
nights
he
was
picked
up
still
alive
by
a
and
carried
to
bombay
where
fully
recovered
he
lived
the
rest
of
his
days
angria
continued
his
activities
for
three
years
during
which
space
he
was
said
to
have
murdered
in
cold
blood
over
englishmen
he
was
eventually
chased
by
commander
jones
in
guns
into
timor
and
after
a
close
siege
of
the
town
for
twelve
months
angria
was
shot
by
one
of
the
mob
while
haranguing
them
from
a

the
first
mention
of
the
name
of
this
notorious
pirate
occurs
in
the
year
when
we
hear
of
him
shipping
himself
at
providence
in
a
sloop
called
the
in
company
with
five
other
rascals

were
conspiring
together
to

the
two

who
escaped
the
usual
end
of
pirates
that
is
by
hanging
shooting
or
drowning
in
saltwater
or
rum
disappeared
into
respectable
obscurity
in
employment
of
some
sort
in
the
city
of
london
this
party
of
six
conspirators
was
the
nucleus
of
a
very
powerful
combination
of
pirates
which
eventually
came
under
the
command
of
the
famous
captain
roberts
anstis
pirate
career
began
as
did
most
others
they
cruised
about
amongst
the
west
india
islands
seizing
and
plundering
all
merchant
ships
they
chanced
upon
and
if
we
are
to
believe
some
of
the
stories
that
were
circulated
at
the
time
of
their
treatment
of
their
prisoners
they
appear
to
have
been
an
even
rougher
lot
of
scoundrels
than
was
usual
before
long
they
seized
a
very
stout
ship
the
bound
from
guinea
to
carolina
and
fitted
her
up
with
cannons
taken
from
another
prize
manned
her
with
a
crew
of
one
hundred
men
and
put
captain
john
fenn
in
command
anstis
as
the
elder
officer
could
have
had
command
of
this
newer
and
larger
ship
but
he
was
so
in
love
with
his
own
vessel
the
which
was
an
excellent
sailer
that
he
preferred
to
remain
in
her
the
party
now
had
two
stout
ships
but
as
so
often
happened
trouble
began
to
ferment
amongst
the
crew
a
large
number
of
these
had
been
more
or
less
forced
to
go
and
were
anxious
to
avoid
the
consequences
so
they
decided
to
send
a
that
is
a
petition
signed
by
all
with
their
names
in
a
circle
so
that
no
rogue
could
be
held
to
be
more
prominent
than
any
other
to
ask
for
the
pardon
this
was
addressed
to
his
most
sacred
majesty
george
by
the
grace
of
god
of
great
britain
france
and
ireland
king
defender
of
the
faith
etc
this
petition
was
sent
to
england
by
a
merchant
vessel
then
sailing
from
jamaica
while
the
crews
hid
their
ships
amongst
the
mangrove
swamps
of
a
small
uninhabited
island
off
the
coast
of
cuba
here
they
waited
for
nine
months
for
an
answer
to
their
petition
to
the
king
living
on
turtle
fish
rice
and
of
course
rum
as
long
as
it
lasted
to
pass
the
time
various
diversions
were
instigated
particularly
dancing
a
pastime
in
great
favour
amongst
pirates
we
have
a
most
amusing
account
left
us
of
a
mock
court
of
justice
held
by
them
to
try
one
another
of
piracy
and
he
who
was
on
one
day
tried
as
the
prisoner
would
next
day
take
his
turn
at
being
judge
this
shows
a
grim
sense
of
humour
as
most
of
those
who
took
part
in
these
mock
trials
were
certain
to
end
their
careers
before
a
real
trial
unless
they
came
to
a
sudden
and
violent
end
beforehand
here
is
an
account
of
one
such
as
given
to
captain
johnson
the
historian
of
the
pirates
by
an
eyewitness
the
court
and
criminals
being
both
appointed
as
also
council
to
plead
the
judge
got
up
in
a
tree
and
had
a
dirty
taurpaulin
hung
over
his
shoulder
this
was
done
by
way
of
robe
with
a
thrum
cap
on
his
head
and
a
large
pair
of
spectacles
upon
his
nose
thus
equipp
he
settled
himself
in
his
place
and
abundance
of
officers
attending
him
below
with
crows
handspikes
instead
of

in

the
pirates
sailed
out
from
their
and
waylaid
the
ship
which
was
returning
to
jamaica
with
the
answer
to
the
petition
but
to
their
disappointment
heard
that
no
notice
had
been
taken
of
their
by
the
government
at
home
no
time
was
lost
in
returning
to
their
old
ways
for
the
very
next
day
both
pirate
ships
left
their
and
sailed
out
on
the
grand
account
but
now
their
luck
deserted
them
for
the
was
run
aground
on
a
reef
by
gross
neglect
on
the
part
of
the
officers
and
wrecked
most
of
the
crew
escaped
on
to
an
island
where
captain
anstis
found
them
next
day
and
no
sooner
had
he
taken
aboard
captain
fenn
phillips
the
carpenter
and
a
few
others
than
all
of
a
sudden
down
upon
them
came
two
the
and
the
so
that
anstis
had
barely
time
to
cut
his
cables
and
get
away
to
sea
hotly
pursued
by
the
the
latter
in
a
stiff
breeze
was
slowly
gaining
on
the
brigantine
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
wind
dropped
the
pirates
got
out
the
sweeps
and
thus
managed
for
the
time
being
to
escape
in
the
meantime
the
took
prisoner
the
forty
pirates
remaining
on
the
island
anstis
soon
got
to
work
again
and
captured
several
prizes
he
then
sailed
to
the
island
of
tobago
to
clean
and
refit
his
ship
just
when
all
the
guns
and
stores
had
been
landed
and
the
ship
heeled
as
would
have
it
the
put
into
the
bay
and
the
pirates
had
barely
time
to
set
their
ship
on
fire
and
to
escape
into
the
woods
anstis
had
by
now
lost
all
authority
over
his
discontented
crew

school

notorious
blackbeard

was
for
the
time
being
in
honest
employment
in
a
newfoundland
which
was
captured
by
phillips
and
his
crew
as
phillips
was
only
a
beginner
at
piracy
he
was
very
glad
to
get
the
aid
of
such
an
old
hand
at
the
game
as
john
archer
whom
he
promptly
appointed
to
the
office
of
quartermaster
in
the
pirate
ship
this
quick
promotion
caused
some
murmuring
amongst

outspoken
against

his
days
on

there
was
no

to
press
him
to
an
acknowledgement
of
the
crime
he
died
for
nor
of
sorrowing
in
particular
for
it
which
would
have
been
exemplary
and
made
suitable
impressions
on
seamen
so
that
his
last
hour
was
spent
in
lamenting
and
bewailing
his
sins
in
general
exhorting
the
spectators
to
an
honest
and
good
life
in
which
alone
they
could
find
satisfaction
this
painful
scene
ended
by
the
condemned
singing
with
the
spectators
a
few
verses
of
the
psalm
at
the
conclusion
of
which
at

days
out

with
two
sloops
the
sight
of
which
dispelled
all
memory
of
their
late
good
intention

turning

more

seized
the
two
sloops

took
out

for

with
bad
luck
or
owing
to
retribution
a
sudden
hurricane
arose
which
drove
them
back
to
the
one
spot
in
the
west
indies
they
must
have
been
most
anxious
to
avoid
that

the
sloop
became

total
wreck

the
crew
got
ashore

hidden
in

wood

where
they
were

fair
promises
induced

to
come
aboard
taking
these
back
to

had
them
all
tried
before
a
court
of
lately
converted
pirates
and
they
were
condemned
to
be
hanged
while
standing
on
the
gallows
platform
the
wretched
culprits
reproached
the
crowd
of
spectators
so
lately
their
in
piracy
for
allowing
their
old
comrades
to
be
hanged
and
urging
them
to
come
to
the
rescue
but
virtue
was
still
strong
in
these
recent
converts
and
all
the
comfort
the
criminals
got
was
to
be
told
it
was
their
business
to
turn
their
minds
to
another
world
and
sincerely
to
repent
of
what
wickedness
they
had
done

at
the
height
of
his
career
avery
caught
the
public
fancy
as
no
other
pirate
ever
did
with
the
possible
exception
of
captain
kidd
so
much
so
that
his
achievements
or
supposed
achievements
formed
the
plot
of
several
popular
novels
and
plays
charles
johnson
wrote
a
play
called
the
successful
pyrate
which
work
ran
into
several
editions
and
was
acted
at
the
theatre
royal
in
drury
lane
the
scene
in
this
play
was
laid
in
the
island
of
madagascar
and
the
hero
was
modelled
on
captain
avery
this
pirate
was
a
devonshire
man
being
born
near
plymouth
about
the
year
and
was
bred
to
the

sailed
on
several
voyages

aboard
a
merchantman

was
later
appointed

in
an
armed
privateer

for

being
hired
by
the
spaniards
for
service
in
the
west
indies
against
the
french
pirates
avery
soon
plotted
a
mutiny
which
was
carried
out
while
lay
at
anchor
in
cadiz
harbour
the
ship
was
seized
and
the
captain
put
ashore
avery
was
elected
captain
and
he
renamed
the
ship
the
the
for
more
than
a
year
avery
sailed
in
this
vessel
preying
without
distinction
upon
persons
of
all
nations
and
religions
after
leaving
spain
he
first
sailed
to
the
isle
of
may
holding
the
portuguese
governor
for
ransom
till
provisions
were
sent
on
board
he
took
near
here
three
english
ships
then
sailed
to
the
coast
of
guinea
to
procure
slaves
to
catch
these
avery
would
anchor
off
a
village
and
hoist
english
colours
the
trusting
negroes
would
then
paddle
off
to
the
ship
in
canoes
bringing
gold
to
traffic
with
at
a
given
signal
these
natives
would
be
seized
clapped
in
irons
and
thrown
into
the
hold
avery
next
sailed
to
the
island
of
princes
where
he
attacked
two
danish
ships
and
took
them
both
the
next
place
the
pirates
touched
at
was
madagascar
from
there
they
sailed
to
the
red
sea
to
await
the
fleet
expected
from
mocha
to
pass
the
time
and
to
earn
an
honest
penny
the
pirates
called
in
at
a
town
called
meat
there
to
sell
to
the
natives
some
of
their
stolen
merchandise
but
the
cautious
inhabitants
refused
to
do
any
business
with
these
suspicious
looking
merchants
so
in
order
to
punish
them
the
pirates
burnt
down
their
town
they
next
visited
aden
where
they
met
two
other
english
pirate
ships
and
were
soon
joined
by
three
others
from
america
all
on
the
same
enterprise
expecting
the
mocha
fleet
to
come
along
they
waited
here
but
the
fleet
slipped
past
the
pirates
in
the
night
avery
was
after
them
the
next
morning
and
catching
them
up
singled
out
the
largest
ship
fought
her
for
two
hours
and
took
her
she
proved
to
be
the
belonging
to
the
great
mogul
himself
and
a
very
valuable
prize
as
out
of
her
they
took
pieces
of
eight
and
a
like
number
of
chequins
as
well
as
several
of
the
highest
persons
of
the
court
who
were
passengers
on
a
pilgrimage
to
mecca
it
was
rumoured
that
a
daughter
of
the
great
mogul
was
also
on
board
accounts
of
this
exploit
eventually
reached
england
and
created
great
excitement
so
that
it
soon
became
the
talk
of
the
town
that
captain
avery
had
taken
the
beautiful
young
princess
to
madagascar
where
he
had
married
her
and
was
living
in
royal
state
the
proud
father
of
several
small
princes
and
princesses
the
mogul
was
naturally
infuriated
at
this
outrage
on
his
ship
and
threatened
in
retaliation
to
lay
waste
all
the
east
india
settlements
having
got
a
vast
booty
avery
and
his
friends
sailed
towards
madagascar
and
on
the
way
there
avery
as
admiral
of
the
little
fleet
signalled
to
the
captain
of
the
other
sloops
to
come
aboard
his
vessel
when
they
arrived
avery
put
before
them
the
following
ingenious
scheme
he
proposed
that
the
treasures
in
the
two
sloops
should
for
safety
be
put
into
his
keeping
till
they
all
three
arrived
in
madagascar
this
being
agreed
to
was
done
but
during
the
night
after
avery
had
explained
matters
to
his
own
men
he
altered
his
course
and
left
the
sloops
and
never
saw
them
again
he
now
sailed
away
with
all
the
plunder
to
the
west
indies
arriving
safely
at
new
providence
island
in
the
bahamas
where
he
offered
the
governor
a
bribe
of
twenty
pieces
of
eight
and
two
pieces
of
gold
to
get
him
a
pardon
avery
arrived
in
at
boston
where
he
appears
to
have
successfully
bribed
the
quaker
governor
to
let
him
and
some
of
his
crew
land
with
their
spoils
unmolested
but
the
pirate
did
not
feel
quite
safe
and
also
thought
it
would
be
wellnigh
impossible
to
sell
his
diamonds
in
the
colony
without
being
closely
questioned
as
to
how
he
came
by
them
so
leaving
america
he
sailed
to
the
north
of
ireland
where
he
sold
the
sloop
here
the
crew
finally
dispersed
and
avery
stopped
some
time
in
dublin
but
was
still
unable
to
dispose
of
his
stolen
diamonds
thinking
england
would
be
a
better
place
for
this
transaction
he
went
there
and
settled
at
bideford
in
devon
here
he
lived
very
quietly
under
a
false
name
and
through
a
friend
communicated
with
certain
merchants
in
bristol
these
came
to
see
him
accepted
his
diamonds
and
some
gold
cups
giving
him
a
few
pounds
for
his
immediate
wants
and
took
the
valuables
to
bristol
to
sell
promising
to
send
him
the
money
procured
for
them
time
dragged
on
but
nothing
came
from
the
bristol
merchants
and
at
last
it
began
to
dawn
on
avery
that
there
were
pirates
on
land
as
well
as
at
sea
his
frequent
letters
to
the
merchants
brought
at
the
most
but
a
few
occasional
shillings
which
were
immediately
swallowed
up
by
the
payment
of
his
debts
for
the
bare
necessities
of
life
at
bideford
at
length
when
matters
were
becoming
desperate
avery
was
taken
ill
and
died
not
being
worth
as
much
as
would
buy
him
a
coffin
thus
ended
avery
the
grand
pirate
whose
name
was
known
all
over
europe
and
who
was
supposed
to
be
reigning
as
a
king

was

and
while
seated
in

corner
with

as
sullen
as

a
surgeon
of

came
up

asked

there
hanged
for
some
extraordinary
reason
the
american

seldom
would

most
rare

law
was
elastic
enough
to
fit
most
crimes

was

months
later

this

he
decided
with

to
aim
at

to
enter
the
profession
of

bellamy
had
now
chosen
a
calling
that
lent
itself
to
his
undoubted
talents
and
his
future
career
while
it
lasted
was
a
brilliant
one
procuring
a
ship
he
sailed
up

down
the
coast
of
carolina
and
new

taking
and
plundering
numerous
vessels
and
when
this
neighbourhood
became

hot
for
him
he
would
cruise
for
a
while
in

cooler
climate
of

bellamy
had
considerable
gifts
for
public
speaking

seldom
missed
an
opportunity
of
addressing
the
assembled
officers

crews
of
the

he
took
before
liberating

otherwise
disposing

had
pleaded

have
his

returned
to

bellamy
after
clearing
his
throat
began
as

i

said
that

i
scorn
to
do
anyone
any
mischief
when
it

not
the

they
get

but
damn
ye
altogether
for

of
crafty
rascals
and
you
who
serve
them
for
a
parcel
of
numbskulls
they
vilify
us
the
scoundrels
do
when
there
is
the
only
difference
that
they
rob
the
poor
under
cover
of
the
law
forsooth
and
we
plunder
the
rich
under
the
protection
of
our
own
courage

you
not
better
make
one
of
us
than
sneak

at

of

bonnet
major
stede
captain
thomas
edwards
the
history
of
this
pirate
is
both
interesting
and
unique
he
was
not
brought
up
to
the
seafaring
life
in
fact
before
he
took
to
piracy
he
had
already
retired
from
the
army
with
the
rank
of
major
he
owned
substantial
landed
property
in
barbadoes
lived
in
a
fine
house
was
married
and
much
respected
by
the
quality
and
gentry
of
that
island
his
turning
pirate
naturally
greatly
scandalized
his
neighbours
and
they
found
it
difficult
at
first
to
imagine
whatever
had
caused
this
sudden
and
extraordinary
resolution
particularly
in
a
man
of
his
position
in
society
but
when
the
cause
at
last
came
to
be
known
he
was
more
pitied
than
blamed
for
it
was
understood
that
the
major
mind
had
become
unbalanced
owing
to
the
unbridled
nagging
of
bonnet
referring
to
this
the
historian
captain
johnson
writes
as
follows
he
was
afterwards
rather
pitty
than
condemned
by
those
that
were
acquainted
with
him
believing
that
this
humour
of
going
proceeded
from
a
disorder
in
his
mind
which
had
been
but
too
visible
in
him
some
time
before
this
wicked
undertaking
and
which
is
said
to
have
been
occasioned
by
some
discomforts
he
found
in
a
married
state
be
that
as
it
will
the
major
was
but
ill
qualified
for
the
business
as
not
understanding
maritime
affairs
whatever
the
cause
of
the
major
disorder
of
mind
the
fact
remains
that
at
his
own
expense
he
fitted
out
a
sloop
armed
with
ten
guns
and
a
crew
of
seventy
men
the
fact
that
he
honestly
paid
in
cash
for
this
ship
is
highly
suspicious
of
a
deranged
mind
since
no
other
pirate
to
the
writer
knowledge
ever
showed
such
a
nicety
of
feeling
but
always
stole
the
ship
in
which
to
embark
on
the
account
the
major
to
satisfy
the
curious
gave
out
that
he
intended
to
trade
between
the
islands
but
one
night
without
a
word
of
farewell
to
bonnet
he
sailed
out
of
harbour
in
the
as
he
called
his
ship
and
began
to
cruise
off
the
coast
of
virginia
for
a
rank
amateur
bonnet
met
with
wonderful
success
as
is
shown
by
a
list
of
the
prizes
he
took
and
plundered
in
this
first
period
of
his
piracy
the
of
glasgow
captain
montgomery
the
of
barbadoes
which
after
plundering
he
burnt
as
he
did
all
prizes
from
barbadoes
the
captain
scott
the
of
leith
the
plunder
out
of
these
ships
he
sold
at
gardiner
island
near
new
york
cruising
next
off
the
coast
of
carolina
bonnet
took
a
brace
of
prizes
but
began
to
have
trouble
with
his
unruly
crew
who
seeing
that
their
captain
knew
nothing
whatever
of
sea
affairs
took
advantage
of
the
fact
and
commenced
to
get
out
of
hand
unluckily
for
bonnet
he
at
this
time
met
with
the
famous
captain
teach
or
blackbeard
and
the
latter
quickly
appreciating
how
matters
stood
ordered
the
major
to
come
aboard
his
own
ship
while
he
put
his
lieutenant
richards
to
command
bonnet
vessel
the
poor
major
was
most
depressed
by
this
undignified
change
in
his
affairs
until
blackbeard
lost
his
ship
in
topsail
inlet
and
finding
himself
at
a
disadvantage
promptly
surrendered
to
the
king
proclamation
and
allowed
bonnet
to
reassume
command
of
his
own
sloop
but
major
bonnet
had
been
suffering
from
qualms
of
conscience
latterly
so
he
sailed
to
bath
town
in
north
carolina
where
he
too
surrendered
to
the
governor
and
received
his
certificate
of
pardon
almost
at
once
news
came
of
war
being
declared
between
england
and
france
with
spain
so
bonnet
hurried
back
to
topsail
and
was
granted
permission
to
take
back
his
sloop
and
sail
her
to
thomas
island
to
receive
a
commission
as
a
privateer
from
the
french
governor
of
that
island
but
in
the
meanwhile
teach
had
robbed
everything
of
any
value
out
of
bonnet
ship
and
had
marooned
seventeen
of
the
crew
on
a
sandy
island
but
these
were
rescued
by
the
major
before
they
died
of
starvation
just
as
the
ship
was
ready
to
sail
a
bumboat
came
alongside
to
sell
apples
and
cider
to

from

an
interesting
piece
of
news
they
learnt
that
teach
with
a
crew
of
eighteen
men
was
at
that
moment
lying
at
anchor
in
ocricock
inlet
the
major
longing
to
revenge
the
insult
he
had
suffered
from
blackbeard
and
his
crew
remembering
how
he
had
left
them
to
die
on
a
desert
island
went
off
in
search
of
teach
but
failed
to
find
him
stede
bonnet
having
received
his
pardon
in
his
own
name
now
called
himself
captain
thomas
and
again
took
to
piracy
and
evidently
had
benefited
by
his
apprenticeship
with
blackbeard
for
he
was
now
most
successful
taking
many
prizes
off
the
coast
of
virginia
and
later
in
delaware
bay
bonnet
now
sailed
in
a
larger
ship
the
so
named
from
feelings
of
loyalty
to
the
crown
but
she
proved
to
be
very
leaky
and
the
pirates
had
to
take
her
to
the
mouth
of
cape
fear
river
for
repairs
news
of
this
being
carried
to
the
council
of
south

arrangements
were
made
to
attempt
to
capture
the

sailing
under
the
direct
command
of
the
gallant

on
september
the
sloops
arrived
at
cape

river
and
there
sure
enough
was
the
with
three
sloops
lying
at
anchor
behind
the
bar
the
pirate
tried
to
escape
by
sailing
out
but
was
followed
by
the
two
vessels
until
all
three
ran
aground
within
gunshot
of
each
other
a
brisk
fight
took
place
for
five
hours
when
the
major
struck
his
colours
and
surrendered
there
was
great
public
rejoicing
in
charleston
when
on
october
colonel
rhet
sailed
victoriously
into
the
harbour
with
his
prisoners
but
next
day
bonnet
managed
to
escape
out
of
prison
and
sailed
to
swillivant
island
the
indefatigable
colonel
rhet
again
set
out
after
the
major
and
again
caught
him
and
brought
him
back
to
charleston
the
trial
of

and
his

on
october
at
charleston
and
continued
till
november
the
judge
being
nicholas

bonnet
was
found
guilty
and
condemned
to
be

judge
trot
made
a
speech
of
overwhelming
length
to
the
condemned
full
of
biblical
quotations
to
each
of
which
the
learned
magistrate
gave
chapter
and
verse
in
november
the
gallant
if
unfortunate
major
was
hanged
at
white
point
charleston
apart
from
the
unusual
cause
for
his
turning
pirate
bonnet
is
interesting
as
being
almost
the
only
case
known
otherwise
than
in
books
of
romance
of
a
pirate
making
his
prisoners
walk

bonny
anne
female
pirate
anne
was
born
in
county
cork
and
her
father
was
an
who
practised
his
profession
in
that
city
her
mother
being
lady
maid
to
the
attorney
lawful
wife
the
story
of
the
events
which
led
to
the
existence
of
anne
may
be
read
in
johnson
history
of
the
pyrates
where
it
is
recounted
in
a
style
quite
suggestive
of
fielding
in
spite
of
its
sad
deficiency
in
moral
tone
the
narrative
is
highly
diverting
but
as
this
work
is
strictly
confined
to
the
history
of
the
pirates
and
not
to
the
amorous
intrigues
of
their
forbears
we
will
skip
these
episodes
and
come
to
the
time
when
the
attorney
having
lost
a
once
flourishing
legal
practice
sailed
from
ireland
to
carolina
to
seek
a
fortune
there
taking
his
little
daughter
anne
with
him
in
new
surroundings
fortune
favoured
the
attorney
and
he
soon
owned
a
rich
plantation
and
his
daughter
kept
house
for
him
anne
was
now
grown
up
and
a
fine
young
woman
but
had
a
fierce
and
courageous
temper
which
more
than
once
led
her
into
scrapes
as
on
one
occasion
when
in
a
sad
fit
of
temper
she
slew
her
english
with
a
but
except
for
these
occasional
outbursts
of
passion
she
was
a
good
and
dutiful
girl
her
father
now
began
to
think
of
finding
a
suitable
young
man
to
be
a
husband
for
anne
which
would
not
be
hard
to
do
since
anne
besides
her
good
looks
was
his
heir
and
would
be
well
provided
for
by
him
but
anne
fell
in
love
with
a
young
sailor
who
arrived
one
day
at
charleston
and
knowing
her
father
would
never
consent
to
such
a
match
the
lovers
were
secretly
married
in
the
expectation
that
the
deed
being
done
the
father
would
soon
become
reconciled
to
it
but
on
the
contrary
the
attorney
on
being
told
the
news
turned
his
daughter
out
of
doors
and
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
either
of
them
the
bridegroom
finding
his
heiress
worth
not
a
groat
did
what
other
sailors
have
done
before
and
since
and
slipped
away
to
sea
without
so
much
as
saying
to
his
bride
but
a
more
gallant
lover
soon
hove
in
sight
the
handsome
rich
pirate
captain
john
rackam
known
up
and
down
the
coast
as
calico
jack
jack
methods
of
courting
and
taking
a
ship
were
similar
no
time
wasted
straight
up
alongside
every
gun
brought
to
play
and
the
prize
seized
anne
was
soon
swept
off
her
feet
by
her
picturesque
and
impetuous
lover
and
consented
to
go
to
sea
with
him
in
his
ship
but
disguised
herself
in
clothes
before
going
on
board
the
lovers
sailed
together
on
a
piratical
honeymoon
until
certain
news
being
conveyed
to
captain
rackam
by
his
bride
he
sailed
to
cuba
and
put
anne
ashore
at
a
small
cove
where
he
had
a
house
and
also
friends
who
he
knew
would
take
good
care
of
her
but
before
long
anne
was
back
in
the
pirate
ship
as
active
as
any
of
her
male
shipmates
with
cutlass
and
marlinspike
always
one
of
the
leaders
in
boarding
a
prize
however
the
day
of
retribution
was
at
hand
while
cruising
near
jamaica
in
october
the
pirates
were
surprised
by
the
sudden
arrival
of
an
armed
sloop
which
had
been
sent
out
by
the
governor
of
that
island
for
the
express
purpose
of
capturing
rackam
and
his
crew
a
fight
followed
in
which
the
pirates
behaved
in
a
most
cowardly
way
and
were
soon
driven
below
decks
all
but
anne
bonny
and
another
woman

read
who
fought
gallantly
till
taken
prisoners
all
the
while
flaunting
their

companions

their
cowardly
conduct
the
prisoners
were
carried
to
jamaica
and
tried
for
piracy
at
jago
de
la
vega
and
convicted
on
november
anne
pleaded
to
have
her
execution
postponed
for
reasons
of
her
condition
of
health
and
this
was
allowed
and
she
never
appears
to
have
been
hanged
though
what
her
ultimate
fate
was
is
unknown
on
the
day
that
her
lover
rackam
was
hanged
he
obtained
by
special
favour
permission
to
see
anne
but
must
have
derived
little
comfort
from
the
farewell
interview
for
all
he
got
in
the
way
of
sympathy
from
his
lady
love
were
these
words
that
she
was
sorry
to
see

called

him
a

consideration

generous
offer

so
preyed

was
a

was
sent

the

a
very
strongly
garrisoned
fort
all
day
the
pirates
kept
up
a
furious
attack
but
were
driven
back
at
last
when
it
seemed
impossible
for
the
pirates
ever
to
succeed
in
entering
the
castle
a
remarkable
accident
happened
which
altered
the
whole
issue
one

was
wounded
by
an
arrow
in
his
back
which
pierced
his
body
and
came
out

side
this
he
instantly
pulled
out
at
the
side
of
his
breast
then
taking
a
little
cotton
he
wound
it
about
the
arrow
and
putting
it
into
his
musket
he
shot
it
back
into
the
castle
the
cotton
kindled
by
the
powder
set
fire
to
several
houses
within
the
castle

being
thatched
with
took
fire
very
easily
this
fire
at
last
reached
the

this
accident
of
the
arrow
the
pirates
were
eventually
able
to
take
the
castle
of
chagre
this
was
one
of
the
finest
and
bravest
defences
ever
made

the
spaniards

on

arica
when
the
buccaneers
were
driven
out
of
the
town
all
escaped
who
could
except
the
surgeons
who
in
a
most
unprofessional
way
had
been
indulging
somewhat
freely
in
the
wines
of
the
country
during
the
battle
and
consequently
were
in
no
condition
to
take
their
places
with
the
retreating
force
the
surgeons
after
being
taken
prisoner
were
persuaded
to
disclose
to
the
spaniards
the
prearranged
signals
by
smoke
from
two
fires
which
was
to
be
given
in
case
of
a
successful
taking
of
the
town
to
bring
up
the
boats
that
were
hiding
on
the
shore
ready
to
take
the
buccaneers
back
to
their
ships
fortunately
the
buccaneers
on
the
shore
arrived
just
as
the
canoes
were
getting
under
way
otherwise
the
whole
remnant
of
them
would
have
perished
the
only
one
of
these
disreputable
surgeons
whose
name
we
know
is
bullock
some
months
afterwards
it
was
ascertained
through
a
prisoner
that
the
spaniards
civilly
entertained
these
surgeons
more
especially
the
women
surgeons
even
such
surgeons
as
these
were
considered
to
be
valuable
in
those
days
in

colonies
bunce
charles

age
of
taken
by

roberts
out
of
a
dutch
galley
in
he
joined
the
pirates
to
be
eventually
hanged
in
he
made
a
moving
speech
from
the
gallows
disclaiming
against
the
guilded
bates
of
power
liberty
and
wealth
that
had
ensnared
him
amongst
the
pirates
earnestly
exhorting
the
spectators
to
remember
his
youth
and
ending
by
declaring
that
he
stood
there
as
a
beacon
upon
a
rock
the
gallows
standing
on
one
to
warn
erring
marriners
of
danger
burder
william
mayor
of
dover
it
may
seem
strange
to
accuse
the
mayor
of
so
important
a
seaport
as
dover
of
being
a
pirate
but
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
william
burder
is
to
escape
the
accusation
when
we
learn
that
in
the
year
he
captured
french
vessels
and
a
large
number
of
neutral
craft
which
he
plundered
and
also
no
fewer
than
spanish
ships
to
the
very
natural
annoyance
of
the
king
of
spain
whose
country
was
at
this
time
at
peace
with
england
burgess
captain
samuel
south
born
and
bred
in
new
york
he
was
a
man
of
good
education
and
began
his
career
on
a
privateer
in
the
west
indies
later
on
he
was
sent
by
a
philips
owner
and
shipbuilder
to
trade
with
the
pirates
in
madagascar
this
business
burgess
augmented
with
a
little
piracy
on
his
own
account
and
after
taking
several
prizes
he
returned
to
the
west
indies
where
he
disposed
of
his
loot
he
then
proceeded
to
new
york
and
purposely
wrecking
his
vessel
at
sandy
hook
landed
in
the
guise
of
an
honest
shipwrecked
mariner
burgess
settled
down
for
a
time
to
a
rest
and
married
a
relative
of
his
employer
philips
philips
sent
him
on
two
further
voyages
both
of
which
were
run
on
perfectly
honest
lines
and
were
most
successful
both
to
owner
and
captain
but
a
later
voyage
had
an
unhappy
ending
after
successfully
trading
with
the
pirates
in
madagascar
burgess
was
returning
home
carrying
several
pirates
as
passengers
who
were
returning
to
settle
in
america
having
made
their
fortunes
the
ship
was
captured
off
the
cape
of
good
hope
by
an
east
indiaman
and
taken
to
madras
here
the
captain
and
passengers
were
put
in
irons
and
sent
to
england
to
be
tried
the
case
against
burgess
fell
through
and
he
was
liberated
instead
of
at
once
getting
away
he
loitered
about
london
until
one
unlucky
day
he
ran
across
an
old
pirate
associate
called
culliford
on
whose
evidence
burgess
was
again
arrested
tried
and
condemned
to
death
but
pardoned
at
the
last
moment
by
the
queen
through
the
intercession
of
the
bishop
of
london
after
a
while
he
procured
the
post
of
mate
in
the
a
scotch
vessel
which
was
to
go
to
madagascar
to
trade
liquors
with
the
pirates
who
had
their
headquarters
in
that
delectable
island
on
arrival
at
madagascar
a
sudden
hurricane
swept
down
dismasted
the
and
sank
two
pirate
ships
the
chief
pirate
halsey
as
usual
proved
himself
a
man
of
resource
seeing
that
without
a
ship
his
activities
were
severely
restricted
he
promptly
with
the
help
of
his
faithful
and
willing
crew
seized
the
this
satisfactory
state
of
affairs
being
largely
facilitated
by
the
knowledge
that
the
mate
burgess
was
all
ripe
to
go
on
the
main
chance
once
more
the
first
venture
of
this
newly
formed
crew
was
most
successful
as
they
seized
a
ship
the
which
lay
in
the
bay
the
owners
of
which
had
but
the
previous
day
bought
and
paid
for
a
valuable
loading
of
merchandise
from
the
pirates
this
was
now
taken
back
by
the
pirates
who
having
refitted
the
set
forth
seeking
fresh
adventures
and
prizes
the
further
history
of
burgess
is
one
of
constant
change
and
disappointment
while
serving
under
a
captain
north
he
was
accused
of
betraying
some
of
his
associates
and
was
robbed
of
all
his
savings
for
several
years
after
this
he
lived
ashore
at
a
place
in
madagascar
called
methalage
until
captured
by
some
dutch
rovers
who
soon
after
were
themselves
taken
by
french
pirates
burgess
with
his
former
dutch
captain
was
put
ashore
at
johanna
where
under
the
former
expert
knowledge
a
ship
was
built
and
sailed
successfully
to
youngoul
where
burgess
got
a
post
as
third
mate
on
a
ship
bound
to
the
west
indies
before
sailing
burgess
was
sent
on
account
of
his
knowledge
of
the
language
as
ambassador
to
the
local
king
burgess
unfortunately
for
himself
had
in
the
past
said
some
rather
unkind
things
about
this
particular
ruler
and
the
offended
monarch
in
revenge
gave
burgess
some
poisoned
liquor
to
drink
which
quickly
brought
to
an
end
an
active
if
chequered
career

cobham
captain
of
poole
in

at
the
age
of
he
took
to
smuggling
his
biographer
tells
us
that
even
at
this
comparatively
early
age
cobham
was
cautious
and
prudent
and
though
he
intrigued
with
the
ladies
he
managed
to
keep
it
secret
cobham
was
very
successful
as
a
smuggler
on
one
occasion
landing
a
cargo
of
ten
thousand
gallons
of
brandy
at
poole
but
a
little
later
on
his
vessel
was
captured
by
a
king
cutter
this
annoyed
the
young
captain
and
he
bought
a
cutter
at
bridport
mounted
fourteen
guns
in
her
and
turned
pirate
out
of
his
very
first
prize
an
indiaman
which
he
boarded
off
the
mersey
he
took
a
sum
of
and
then
scuttled
the
ship
and
drowned
the
crew
cobham
calling
in
at
plymouth
met
a
damsel
called
maria
whom
he
took
on
board
with
him
which
at
first
caused
some
murmuring
amongst
his
crew
who
were
jealous
because
they
themselves
were
not
able
to
take
lady
companions
with
them
on
their
voyages
for
as
the
same
biographer
sagely
remarks
where
a
man
is
married
the
case
is
altered
no
man
envies
him
his
happiness
but
where
he
only
keeps
a
girl
every
man
says
have
as
much
right
to
one
as
he
has
nevertheless
maria
proved
herself
a
great
success
for
when
any
member
of
the
crew
was
to
be
punished
maria
would
use
her
influence
with
the
captain
to
get
him
excused
or
his
punishment
lessened
thus
winning
the
affection
of
all
on
board
the
english
channel
becoming
too
dangerous
for
cobham
he
sailed
across
the
atlantic
and
lay
in
wait
for
vessels
between
cape
breton
and
prince
edward
isle
and
took
several
prizes
in
one
of
these
he
placed
all
the
crew
in
sacks
and
threw
them
into
the
sea
maria
too
took
her
part
in
these
affairs
and
once
stabbed
to
the
heart
with
her
own
little
dirk
the
captain
of
a
liverpool
brig
the
and
on
another
occasion
to
indulge
her
whim
a
captain
and
his
two
mates
were
tied
up
to
the
windlass
while
maria
shot
them
with
her
pistol
maria
always
wore
naval
uniform
both
at
sea
and
when
in
port
in
fact
she
entered
thoroughly
into
the
spirit
of
the
enterprise
cobham
now
wished
to
retire
from
the
sea
but
maria
urged
him
to
further
efforts
as
she
had
set
her
heart
on
his
buying
her
a
beautiful
place
in
england
called
mapleton
hall
near
poole
maria
last
act
at
sea
was
to
poison
the
whole
crew
of
an
indiaman
who
were
prisoners
in
irons
aboard
the
pirate
ship
cobham
having
made
a
vast
fortune
at
last
decided
to
settle
down
and
he
bought
a
large
estate
near
havre
from
the
duc
de
chartres
it
was
on
the
coast
and
had
a
snug
little
harbour
of
its
own
where
the
retired
pirate
kept
a
small
pleasure
yacht
in
which
he
and
maria
used
to
go
for
fishing
expeditions
one
day
when
they
were
out
on
one
of
these
picnics
a
west
india
brig
lay
becalmed
near
by
and
cobham
and
his
crew
went
on
board
to
visit
the
captain
of
the
merchant
ship
but
the
temptation
proved
too
strong
and
cobham
suddenly
shooting
the
captain
maria
and
the
crew
quickly
despatched
the
rest
carrying
the
prize
to
bordeaux
he
sold
her
for
a
good
price
this
was
cobham
last
act
of
piracy
and
soon
afterwards
he
was
made
a
magistrate
and
presided
at
the
county
courts
maria
it
was
thought
possibly
owing
to
remorse
poisoned
herself
with

to
a

let

then
one
day
met

coming
up
with

hailed

came
up
alongside

suddenly
fired
a
broadside
and
a
volley
of
small
arms
into

and
a

engagement
followed
in

were
worsted

lucky
to

he
was
fortunate
enough
to
make

found
amongst

carrying
this
rich
prize
to

they
plundered
her
of
a
large
amount
of
money
having
now
gathered
a
vast
fortune
they
thought
it
time
to
give
up
piracy
so
they
returned
to
the
island
of

where
they
made
a
share
of
their
plunder

they

and
sailed
to

in
west
africa
thence
to
the
coast
of

round
the

where
cowley
mentions
that
owing
to

intense

weather
the

were
able
each

to
drink
three
quarts
of
burnt
brandy
a
day
without
becoming
drunk
on
february
the
buccaneers
were
abreast
of
cape
horn
and
in
his
diary
cowley
writes
we
were
choosing
valentines
and
discoursing
on
the
intrigues
of
woman
when
there
arose
a
prodigious
storm
which
lasted
till
the
end
of
the
month
driving
them
farther
south
than
any
ship
had
ever
been
before
so
that
we
concluded
the
discoursing
of
women
at
sea
was
very
unlucky
and
occasioned
the
storm
cowley
who
was
addicted
to
giving
new
names
to
islands
not
only
named
one
pepys
island
but
when
he
arrived
at
the
galapagos
islands
he
rechristened
them
most
thoroughly
naming
one
king
charles
island
while
others
he
named
after
the
dukes
of
york
norfolk
and
albemarle
and
sir
john
narborough
feeling
no
doubt
that
he
had
done
enough
to
honour
the
great
and
perhaps
to
have
insured
himself
against
any
future
trouble
with
the
authorities
when
he
returned
home
he
named
one
small
island

the

when
complaint
was
made
to
him
that

had
killed
some
of

he
gave
us
a
toleration
to

presents
were

a
valuable

no

taken
off
the
hand
of
some
other
loyal
subject
of
the

here
the

committed
several
atrocious
cruelties
on
the
indians
who
wished
to
be
friends
with

foreigners
in
april
they
arrived
at
canton
to
refit
and
while
there
thirteen
tartar
ships
arrived
laden
with
chinese
merchandise
chiefly
valuable
silks
cowley
wanted
to
attack
and
plunder
them
but
his

refused
to
do
so
saying
they
came
for
gold
and
silver
and
not

all
have
made
our

have
done
no

any
harm

they

island
cowley
describes

next
to

the

mutinied
and
cowley
and
eighteen
others
bought
a
boat
and
sailed
in
her
to
java
some
leagues
here
they
heard
of
the
death
of
king
charles
which
caused
cowley
to
get
out
his

to
change

cox
captain
john
buccaneer
born

by
some
of
his
fellow

to
have
forced
kindred
upon
captain
sharp
the
leader
of
the
fleet
out
of
old
acquaintance
only
to
advance
himself
thus
he
was
made
to
captain
sharp
in
place
of
captain
cook
whose
crew
had
mutinied
and
refused
to
sail
any
longer
under
his
command
cox
began
his
captaincy
by
getting
lost
but
after
a
fortnight
rejoined
the
fleet
off
the
island
of
plate
on
the
coast
of
peru
to
the
great
joy
of
us
all
this
island
received
its
name
from
the
fact
that
sir
francis
drake
had
here
made
a
division
of
his
spoils
distributing
to
each
man
of
his
company
sixteen
bowlfuls
of
doubloons
and
pieces
of

rechristened
it

on
the

sacked
the

burnt
down
the
large
sugar
factory
outside
he
led
a
mutiny
against

relative
and
benefactor
captain
sharp
on
new
year
day
being
the
main
promoter
of
their
design
to
turn
him
out
sharp
afterwards
described
his
old
friend
as
a
dissembling
man
who
he
had
promoted

merely
for

coxon
captain
john
buccaneer
one
of
the
most
famous
of
the
brethren
of
the
coast
in
the
spring
of
in
company
of
other
english
buccaneers
he
surprised
and
plundered
the
town
of

on
the
spanish
main
carrying
away
the
governor
and
the
bishop
to
jamaica
in
coxon
with

and
others
was
fitting
out
an
expedition
in
jamaica
to
make
a
raid
in
the
gulf
of
honduras
which
proved
very
successful
as
they
brought
back
chests
of
indigo
besides
cocoa
cochineal
tortoiseshell
money
and
plate
coxon
was
soon
out
again
upon
a
much
bolder
design
for
in
december
he
met
sharp
essex
allinson
row
and
other
buccaneer
chiefs
at
point
morant
and
in
january
set
sail
for
porto
bello
landing
some
twenty
leagues
from
the
town
they
marched
for
four
days
arriving
in
sight
of
the
town
on
february
many
of
them
being
weak
being
three
days
without
any
food
and
their
feet
cut
with
the
rocks
for
want
of
shoes
they
quickly
took
and
plundered
the
town
hurrying
off
with
their
spoils
before
the
arrival
of
strong
spanish
reinforcements
the
share
of
each
man
in
this
enterprise
came
to
one
hundred
pieces
of
eight
a
warrant
was
issued
by
lord
carlisle
the
governor
of
jamaica
for
the
apprehension
of
coxon
for
plundering
porto
bello
and
another
was
issued
soon
after
by
morgan
when
acting
as
governor
but
nothing
seems
to
have
resulted
from
these
sailing
north
to
boca
del
toro
they
careened
their
ships
and
were
joined
by
sawkins
and
harris
from
this
place
the
buccaneers
began
in
april
to
land
and
cross
the
isthmus
of
darien
taking
the
town
of
santa
maria
on
the
way
quarrels
took
place
between
coxon
who
was
no
doubt
a
man
and
harris
which
led
to
blows
coxon
was
also
jealous
of
the
popular
young
captain
sawkins
and
refused
to
go
further
unless
he
was
allowed
to
lead
one
of
the
companies
after
sacking
the
town
of
santa
maria
the
adventurers
proceeded
in
canoes
down
the
river
to
the
pacific
seizing
two
small
vessels
they
found
there
and
accompanied
by
a
flotilla
of
canoes
they
steered
for
panama
and
with
the
utmost
daring
attacked
and
eventually
took
the
spanish
fleet
of
one
of
the
most
remarkable
achievements
in
the
history
of
the
buccaneers
coxon
now
quarrelled
again
with
his
brother
leaders
and
began
a
march
back
across
the
isthmus
his
party
of
seventy
malcontents
including
dampier
and
wafer
who
each
published
accounts
of
their
journey
by
coxon
seems
to
have
so
ingratiated
himself
with
the
jamaican
authorities
as
to
be
sent
in
quest
of
a
troublesome
french
pirate
jean
hamlin
who
was
playing
havoc
with
the
english
shipping
in
his
vessel
later
in
the
same
year
coxon
procured
letters
of
marque
from
robert
clarke
the
governor
of
new
providence
island
himself
nothing
better
than
a
pirate
to
go
cruising
as
a
privateer
coxon
was
continually
being
arrested
and
tried
for
piracy
but
each
time
he
managed
to
escape
the
gallows
we
do
not
know
the
name
of
the
ship
coxon
commanded
at
this
date
but
it
was

eighty
tons

with
eight

they
arrived
at
ancona
with
a
cargo
of

here
the
captain
took
on
board
a
new
carpenter
called
richardson
who
soon
became
a
close
friend
of
the
mate
these
two
brought
about
a
mutiny
attacked
the
captain
and
threw
him
still
alive
over
the
side
to
drown
coyle
was
elected
captain
and
they
sailed
as
pirates
in
which
capacity
they
were
a
disgrace
to
an
ancient
calling
after
a
visit
to
minorca
which
ended
with
ignominy
they
sailed
to
tunis
where
coyle
told
such
a
plausible
yarn
as
to
deceive
the
governor
into
believing
that
he
had
been
the
master
of
a
vessel
lost
in
a
storm
off
the
coast
of
sardinia
the
pirates
were
supplied
with
money
by
the
british
consul
in
tunis
but
coyle
while
in
his
cups
talked
too
freely
so
that
the
true
story
of
his
doings
got
to
the
consul
ears
who
had
him
arrested
and
sent
to
london
to
be
lodged
in
the
marshalsea

from

he

little
is

he
recognized

denounced
another

george
third
earl
of
trinity
college
cambridge
after
taking
his
degree
at
cambridge
he
migrated
to
oxford
for
the
purpose
of
studying
geography
so
many
books
have
been
written
about
this
picturesque
and
daring
adventurer
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
do
more
than
mention
his
name
here
as
being
perhaps
the
finest
example
of
a
buccaneer
that
ever
sacked
a
spanish
town
he
led
twelve
voyages
to
the
spanish
main
fitting
them
out
at
his
own
expense
and
encountering
the
same
dangers
and
hardships

his

seaman
he
married
in

the
age
of
nineteen
and

voyage

cumberland
was
greatly
esteemed
by
queen
elizabeth
and
always
wore
in
his
hat
a
glove
which
she
had
given
him
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
show
that
the
earl
was
not
prompted
to
spend
his
life
and
fortune
on
buccaneering
voyages
merely
by
greed
of
plunder
but
was
chiefly
inspired
by
intense
love
of
his
country
loyalty
to
his
queen
and
bitter
hatred
of
the
spaniards

a
life
he
detested
he
was

apprenticed

was
to

in
the
same
year
he
sailed

but
finding
the
bitter
cold
unbearable
he
returned
to
england
his
next
voyage
which
he
called
a
warm
one
was
to
the
east
indies
in
the
and
and
suited
him
better
many
books
have
been
written
recounting
the
voyages
of
dampier
but
none
of
these
are
better
reading
than
his
own
narrative
published
by
james
and
john
knapton
in
london
this
popular
book
ran
into
many
editions
the
best
being
the
fourth
published
in
in
four
volumes
these
volumes
are
profusely
illustrated
by
maps
and
rough
charts
and
also
with
crude
cuts
which
are
intended
to
portray
the
more
interesting
and
strange
animals
birds
fishes
and
insects
met
with
in
his
voyages
round
the
globe
in
dampier
enlisted
as
a
seaman
in
the
commanded
by
the
famous
sir
edward
spragge
and
fought
in
the
dutch
war
a
year
later
he
sailed
to
jamaica
in
the
to
take
up
a
post
as
manager
of
a
plantation
belonging
to
a
colonel
hellier
his
restless
spirit
soon
revolted
against
this
humdrum
life
on
a
plantation
and
dampier
again
went
to
sea
sailing
in
a
small
trading
vessel
amongst
the
islands
dampier
first
step
towards
buccaneering
was
taken
when
he
shipped
himself
on
a
small
ketch
which
was
sailing
from
port
royal
to
load
logwood
at
the
bay
of
campeachy
this
was
an
illegal
business
as
the
spanish
government
claimed
the
ownership
of
all
that
coast
and
did
their
best
to
prevent
the
trade
dampier
found
some
englishmen
engaged
in
cutting
the
wood
which
they
exchanged
for
rum
most
of
these
men
were
buccaneers
or
privateers
who
made
a
living
in
this
way
when
out
of
a
job
afloat
when
a
ship
came
into
the
coast
these
men
would
think
nothing
of
coming
aboard
and
spending
thirty
and
forty
pounds
on
rum
and
punch
at
a
single
drinking
bout
dampier
returned
afterwards
to
take
up
logwood
cutting
himself
but
met
with
little
success
and
went
off
to
beef
island
he
had
by
this
time
begun
to
take
down
notes
of
all
that
appeared
to
him
of
interest
particularly
objects
of
natural
history
for
example
he
described
in
his
own
quaint
style
an
animal
he
found
in
this
island
the
squash
is
a
beast
bigger
than
a
cat
its
head
is
much
like
a
foxes
with
short
ears
and
a
long
nose
it
has
pretty
short
legs
and
sharp
claws
by
which
it
will
run
up
trees
like
a
cat
the
flesh
is
good
sweet
wholesome
meat
we
commonly
skin
and
roast
it
and
then
we
call
it
pig
and
i
think
it
eats
as
well
it
feeds
on
nothing
but
good
fruit
therefore
we
find
them
most
among
the
this
creature
never
rambles
very
far
and
being
taken
young
will
become
as
tame
as
a
dog
and
be
as
roguish
as
a
monkey
dampier
first
act
of
actual
piracy
was
when
he
joined
in
an
attack
on
the
spanish
fort
of
alvarado
but
although
the
fort
was
taken
the
townspeople
had
time
to
escape
with
all
their
valuables
before
the
pirates
could
reach
them
returning
to
england
in
he
did
not
remain
long
at
home
for
in
the
beginning
of
he
sailed
for
jamaica
in
a
vessel
named
the
shortly
after
reaching
the
west
indies
he
chanced
to
meet
with
several
buccaneers
including
captains
coxon
sawkins
and
sharp
joining
with
these
he
sailed
on
march
for
the
province
of
darien
to
pillage
and
plunder
these
parts
dampier
says
strangely
little
about
his
adventures
for
the
next
two
years
but
a
full
description
of
them
is
given
by
ringrose
in
his
dangerous
voyage
and
bold
adventures
of
captain
sharp
and
others
in
the
south
sea
published
as
an
addition
to
the
history
of
the
buccaneers
of
america
in
this
narrative
tells
how
the
buccaneers
crossed
the
isthmus
and
attacked
and
defeated
the
spanish
fleet
off
panama
city
after
the
death
of
their
leader
sawkins
the
party
split
up
and
dampier
followed
captain
sharp
on
his
dangerous
and
bold
voyage
in
may
in
april
after
various
adventures
up
and
down
the
coast
of
peru
and
chile
further
quarrels
arose
amongst
the
buccaneers
and
a
party
of
malcontents
of
which
number
dampier
was
one
went
off
on
their
own
account
in
a
launch
and
two
canoes
from
the
island
of
plate
made
famous
by
drake
and
landed
on
the
mainland
near
cape
san
lorenzo
the
march
across
the
isthmus
of
darien
has
been
amusingly
recounted
by
the
surgeon
of
the
party
lionel
wafer
in
his
book
entitled
a
new
voyage
and
description
of
the
isthmus
of
america
published
in
london
in
illustration
a
page
from
the
of
captain
dampier
to
face
p
on
reaching
the
atlantic
dampier
found
some
buccaneer
ships
and
joined
them
arriving
at
virginia
in
july
in
this
country
he
resided
for
a
year
but
tells
little
about
it
beyond
hinting
that
great
troubles
befell
him
in
april
he
joined
a
privateer
vessel
the
but
directly
she
was
out
of
sight
of
land
the
crew
turned
pirates
which
had
been
their
intention
all
along
two
good
narratives
have
been
written
of
this
voyage
one
by
dampier
and
the
other
by
cowley
the
this
venture
ended
in
the
famous
circumnavigation
of
the
world
and
dampier
described
every
object
of
interest
he
met
with
including
the
country
and
natives
of
the
north
coast
of
australia
which
had
never
been
visited
before
by
europeans
dampier
must
have
found
it
very
difficult
to
keep
his
journal
so
carefully
and
regularly
particularly
in
his
early
voyages
when
he
was
merely
a
seaman
before
the
mast
or
a
petty
officer
he
tells
us
that
he
carried
about
with
him
a
long
piece
of
hollow
bamboo
in
which
he
placed
his
manuscript
for
safe
keeping
waxing
the
ends
to
keep
out
the
sea
water
after
almost
endless
adventures
and
hardships
he
arrived
back
in
england
in
september
after
a
voyage
of
eight
years
and
an
absence
from
england
of
twelve
without
a
penny
piece
in
his
pocket
nor
any
other
property
except
his
unfortunate
friend
prince
jeoly
whom
he
sold
on
his
arrival
in
the
thames
to
supply
his
own
immediate
wants
dampier
next
voyage
was
in
the
year
when
he
was
appointed
to
command
of
twelve
guns
and
a
crew
of
fifty
men
and
boys
and
victualled
for
twenty
months
cruise
the
object
of
this
voyage
was
to
explore
and
map
the
new
continent
to
the
south
of
the
east
indies
which
dampier
had
discovered
on
his
previous
voyage
had
he
in
this
next
voyage
taken
the
westward
course
as
he
originally
intended
and
sailed
to
australia
round
the
horn
it
is
possible
that
dampier
would
have
made
many
of
the
discoveries
for
which
james
cook
afterwards
became
so
famous
and
by
striking
the
east
coast
of
australia
would
very
likely
have
antedated
the
civilisation
of
that
continent
by
fifty
years
but
he
was
persuaded
partly
by
his
timid
crew
and
perhaps
in
some
measure
by
his
own
dislike
of
cold
temperatures
to
sail
by
the
eastward
route
and
to
double
the
cape
of
good
hope
the
story
of
this
voyage
is
given
by
dampier
in
his
book
published
in
a
voyage
to
new
holland
in
the
year
after
spending
some
unprofitable
weeks
on
the
north
coast
of
australia
failing
to
find
water
or
to
make
friends
with
the
aboriginals
scurvy
broke
out
amongst
his
somewhat
mutinous
crew
and
he
sailed
to
new
guinea
the
coast
of
which
he
saw
on
new
year
day
by
this
time
the
was
falling
to
pieces
her
wood
rotten
her
hull
covered
with
barnacles
eventually
using
the
pumps
day
and
night
they
arrived
on
february
at
ascension
island
where
the
old
ship
sank
at
her
anchors
getting
ashore
with
their
belongings
they
waited
on
this
desolate
island
until
april
when
four
ships
arrived
three
of
them
english
i
was
told
only
the
other
day
by
a
friend
who
lives
in
the
island
of
helena
and
whose
duties
take
him
at
least
once
each
year
to
ascension
island
that
a
story
still
survives
amongst
the
inhabitants
of
these
islands
that
there
is
hidden
somewhere
in
the
sandhills
a
treasure
which
dampier
is
believed
to
have
put
there
for
safe
keeping
but
for
some
reason
never
removed
but
poor
dampier
never
came
by
a
treasure
in
this
or
any
other
of
his
voyages
and
though
the
legend
is
a
pleasant
one
it
is
a
legend
and
nothing
more
dampier
went
on
board
one
of
the
the
with
of
his
crew
taken
to
barbadoes
he
there
procured
a
berth
in
another
vessel
the
in
which
he
sailed
to
england
dampier
had
now
made
so
great
a
name
for
himself
by
his
two
voyages
round
the
globe
that
he
was
granted
a
commission
by
prince
george
of
denmark
to
sail
as
a
privateer
in
the
to
prey
on
french
and
spanish
ships
the
terms
being
no
purchase
no
pay
sailing
as
his
consort
was
the
whose
master
was
alexander
selkirk
the
original
of
robinson
crusoe
this
voyage
fully
recounted
in
dampier
book
is
a
long
tale
of
adventure
hardship
and
disaster
and
the
explorer
eventually
returned
to
england
a
beggar
however
his
travels
made
a
great
stir
and
he
was
allowed
to
kiss
the
queen
hand
and
to
have
the
honour
of
relating
his
adventures
to
her
dampier
last
voyage
was
in
the
capacity
of
pilot
or
navigating
officer
to
captain
woodes
rogers
in
the
which
sailed
with
another
bristol
privateer
the
in
the
interesting
narrative
of
this
successful
voyage
is
told
by
rogers
in
his
book
a
cruising
voyage
round
the
world
published
in
another
account
was
written
by
the
captain
of
the
edward
cooke
and
published
in
the
same
year
this
last
voyage
round
the
world
ended
at
erith
on
october
and
was
the
only
one
in
which
dampier
returned
with
any
profit
other
than
to
his
reputation
as
an
explorer
and
navigator
dampier
was
now
years
of
age
and
apparently
never
went
to
sea
again
in
fact
he
henceforth
disappears
from
the
stage
altogether
and
is
supposed
to
have
died
in
colman
street
in
london
in
the
year
of
dampier
early
life
in
england
little
is
known
except
that
he
owned
at
one
time
a
small
estate
in
somersetshire
and
that
in
he
married
a
young
woman
out
of
the
family
of
the
duchess
of
grafton
there
is
an
interesting
picture
of
dampier
in
the
national
portrait
gallery
painted
by
murray
and
i
take
this
opportunity
to
thank
the
directors
for
their
kind
permission
to
reproduce
this
portrait
one
other
book
dampier
wrote
called
a
discourse
of
winds
an
interesting
work
and
one
which
added
to
the
author
reputation
as
a
hydrographer
there
is
little
doubt
that
defoe
was
inspired
by
the
experiences
and
writings
of
dampier
not
only
in
his
greatest
work
robinson
crusoe
but
also
in
captain
singleton

turned

witness
at
his
trial

daniel
captain
a
french
filibuster
the
name
of
this
bloodthirsty
pirate
will
go
down
to
fame
as
well
as
notoriety
by
his
habit
of
combining
piracy
with
strict
church
discipline
harling
recounts
an
example
of
this
as
follows
the
original
account
of
the
affair
being
written
by
a
priest
labat
who
seems
to
have
had
rather
a
weak
spot
in
his
heart
for
the
buccaneer
fraternity
captain
daniel
in
need
of
provisions
anchored
one
night
off
one
of
the
small
islands
near
dominica
and
landing
without
opposition
took
possession
of
the
house
of
the
cur√©
and
of
some
other
inhabitants
of
the
neighbourhood
he
carried
the
cur√©
and
his
people
on
board
his
ship
without
offering
them
the
least
violence
and
told
them
that
he
merely
wished
to
buy
some
wine
brandy
and
fowls
while
these
were
being
gathered
daniel
requested
the
cur√©
to
celebrate
mass
which
the
poor
priest
dared
not
refuse
so
the
necessary
sacred
vessels
were
sent
for
and
an
altar
improvised
on
the
deck
for
the
service
which
they
chanted
to
the
best
of
their
ability
as
at
martinique
the
mass
was
begun
by
a
discharge
of
artillery
and
after
the
exaudiat
and
prayer
for
the
king
was
closed
by
a
loud
la
roi
from
the
throats
of
the
buccaneers
a
single
incident
however
somewhat
disturbed
the
devotions
one
of
the
buccaneers
remaining
in
an
indecent
attitude
during
the
elevation
was
rebuked
by
the
captain
and
instead
of
heeding
the
correction
replied
with
an
impertinence
and
a
fearful
oath
quick
as
a
flash
daniel
whipped
out
his
pistol
and
shot
the
buccaneer
through
the
head
adjuring
god
that
he
would
do
as
much
to
the
first
who
failed
in
his
respect
to
the
holy
sacrifice
the
shot
was
fired
close
by
the
priest
who
as
we
can
readily
imagine
was
considerably
agitated
not
be
troubled
my
father
said
daniel
is
a
rascal
lacking
in
his
duty
and
i
have
punished
him
to
teach
him
better
a
very
efficacious
means
remarks
labat
of
preventing
his
falling
into
another
like
mistake
after
the
mass
the
body
of
the
dead
man
was

davis
had
to
put
his
sick
on
shore
as
spotted
fever
raged
amongst
the
crew
davis
then
cruised
for
a
while
with
the
buccaneer
knight
sacking
several
towns
deciding

return
to

west

with

davis
then
sailed

sailed
to

and
settled
down
at
point
comfort
we
hear
no
more
of

for

fourteen
years
until

when
he
sailed
from

next
sailed
to
the
samballoes
and
guided
by
the
indians
who
were
friendly
to
the
buccaneers
but
hated
the
spaniards
they
attacked
the
where
in
spite
of
most
cruel
tortures
they
got
but
little
gold
the
crew
next
attacked
porto
bello
but
found
little
worth
stealing
in
that
much
harassed
town
davis
is
chiefly
remarkable
for
having
commanded
his
gang
of
ruffians
in
the
pacific
for
nearly
four
years
to
do
this
he
must
have
been
a
man
of
extraordinary
personality
and
bravery
for
no
other
buccaneer
or
pirate
captain
ever
remained
in
uninterrupted
power
for
so
long
a
while
with
the
exception
of
captain
bartholomew
roberts
davis
captain
howel
this
welsh
pirate
was
born
at
milford
in
monmouthshire
he
went
to
sea
as
a
boy
and
eventually
sailed
as
chief
mate
in
the
snow
of
bristol
to
the
guinea
coast
his
ship
was
taken
off
sierra
leone
by
the
pirate
england
and
the
captain
murdered
davis
turned
pirate
and
was
given
command
of
this
old
vessel
the
in
which
to
go
on
the
account
but
the
crew
refused
to
turn
pirate
and
sailed
the
ship
to
barbadoes
and
there
handed
davis
over
to
the
governor
who
imprisoned
him
for
three
months
and
then
liberated
him
as
no
one
on
the
island
would
offer
him
employment
davis
went
to
new
providence
island
the
stronghold
of
the
west
india
pirates
arrived
there
he
found
that
captain
woodes
rogers
had
only
lately
come
from
england
with
an
offer
of
a
royal
pardon
which
most
of
the
pirates
had
availed
themselves
of
davis
got
employment
under
the
governor
on
board
the
sloop
the
to
trade
goods
with
the
french
and
spanish
settlements
the
crew
was
composed
of
the
very
recently
reformed
pirates
and
no
sooner
was
the
sloop
out
of
sight
of
land
than
they
mutinied
and
seized
the
vessel
davis
being
voted
captain
on
which
occasion
over
a
bowl
of
punch
in
the
great
cabin
the
new
captain
made
an
eloquent
speech
finishing
by
declaring
war
against
the
whole
world
davis
proved
himself
an
enterprising
and
successful
pirate
chief
but
preferred
whenever
possible
to
use
strategy
and
cunning
rather
than
force
to
gain
his
ends
his
first
prize
was
a
big
french
ship
which
although
davis
had
only
a
small
sloop
and
a
crew
of
but
men
he
managed
to
take
by
a
bold
and
clever
trick
after
taking
a
few
more
ships
in
the
west
indies
davies
sailed
across
the
atlantic
to
the
island
of
nicholas
in
the
cape
verde
islands
here
he
and
his
crew
were
a
great
social
success
spending
weeks
on
shore
as
the
guests
of
the
governor
and
chief
inhabitants
when
davis
reluctantly
left
this
delightful
spot
five
of
his
crew
were
missing
being
so
charmed
with
the
luxuries
of
the
place
and
the
conversation
of
some
women
that
they
stayed
behind
davis
now
went
cruising
and
took
a
number
of
vessels
and
arrived
eventually
at
jago
the
portuguese
governor
of
this
island
did
not
take
at
all
kindly
to
his
bold
visitor
and
was
blunt
enough
to
say
he
suspected
davis
of
being
a
pirate
this
suspicion
his
crew
took
exception
to
and
they
decided
they
could
not
let
such
an
insult
pass
so
that
very
night
they
made
a
sudden
attack
on
the
fort
taking
and
plundering
it
davis
sailed
away
next
morning
to
the
coast
and
anchored
off
the
castle
of
gambia
which
was
strongly
held
for
the
african
company
by
the
governor
and
a
garrison
of
english
soldiers
davis
nothing
daunted
proposed
to
his
merry
men
a
bold
and
ingenious
stratagem
by
which
they
could
take
the
castle
and
the
crew
agreeing
it
was
carried
out
with
so
much
success
that
they
soon
had
the
castle
governor
and
soldiers
in
their
possession
as
well
as
a
rich
spoil
of
bars
of
gold
and
all
these
without
a
solitary
casualty
on
either
side
after
this
brilliant
coup
many
of
the
soldiers
joined
the
pirates
the
pirates
were
attacked
shortly
afterwards
by
a
french
ship
commanded
by
captain
la
bouse
but
on
both
ships
hoisting
their
colours
the
jolly
roger
they
understood
each
other
and
fraternized
and
then
sailed
together
to
sierra
leone
where
they
attacked
a
tall
ship
they
found
lying
there
at
anchor
this
ship
also
proved
to
be
a
pirate
commanded
by
one
captain
cocklyn
so
the
three
joined
forces
and
assaulted
the
fort
which
after
a
sharp
bombardment
surrendered
davis
was
then
elected
commander
of
the
pirate
fleet
but
one
night
when
entertaining
the
other
captains
in
his
cabin
all
having
drunk
freely
of
punch
they
started
to
quarrel
and
blows
were
threatened
when
davis
with
true
celtic
eloquence
hiccupped
out
the
following
speech
hearke
ye
you
cocklyn
and
la
bouse
i
find
by
strengthening
you
i
have
put
a
rod
into
your
hands
to
whip
myself
but
i
still
able
to
deal
with
you
both
but
since
we
met
in
love
let
us
part
in
love
for
i
find
that
three
of
a
trade
can
never
agree
alone
once
more
davis
had
prodigious
success
taking
prize
after
prize
amongst
others
the
the
second
mate
in
which
was
one
roberts
soon
to
become
a
most
famous
pirate
off
anamaboe
he
took
a
very
rich
prize
a
hollander
ship
on
board
of
which
was
the
governor
of
accra
and
his
retinue
as
well
as
sterling
and
rich
merchandise
arriving
next
at
the
portuguese
island
of
princes
davis
posed
as
an
english
in
search
of
pirates
and
was
most
warmly
welcomed
by
the
governor
who
received
him
in
person
with
a
guard
of
honour
and
entertained
him
most
hospitably
davis
heard
that
the
governor
and
the
chief
persons
of
the
island
had
sent
their
wives
to
a
village
a
few
miles
away
so
the
pirate
and
a
few
chosen
spirits
decided
to
pay
a
surprise
visit
on
these
ladies
however
the
ladies
on
perceiving
their
gallant
callers
shrieked
and
ran
into
the
woods
and
in
fact
made
such
a
hullabaloo
that
the
english
don
juans
were
glad
to
slink
away
and
the
thing
made
some
noise
but
not
being
known
was
passed
over
davis
ever
a
cunning
rogue
now
formed
a
pretty
scheme
to
take
the
governor
and
chief
inhabitants
prisoners
and
to
hold
them
for
a
big
ransom
this
plan
was
spoilt
by
a
portuguese
slave
swimming
to
shore
and
telling
the
governor
all
about
it
and
worse
telling
him
about
the
little
affair
of
davis
and
his
visit
to
the
ladies
in
the
wood
the
governor
now
laid
his
plans
and
with
such
success
that
davis
walked
unsuspecting
into
the
trap
and
was
shot
in
the
bowels
but
it
is
some
consolation
to
know
that
he
dyed
like
a
game
cock
as
he
shot
two
of
the
portuguese
with
his
pistols
as
he
fell
thus
died
a
man
noted
during
his
lifetime
by
his
contemporaries
for
his
affability
and
good
nature
which
only
goes
to
show
how
one
point
of
view
is
apt
to
be
influenced
by
circumstances
davis
gabriel
tried
for
piracy
at
the
star
tavern
in
boston

william
a
welshman
arrived
at

with

he
beat
he
deserted
his
ship
and
went
to
live
ashore
with
the
negroes
one
of
whom
he
married
with
whom
he
settled
down
one
evening
the
weather
being
hot
and
davis
being
very
thirsty
he
sold
his
bride
for
some
punch
his
wife
relations
being
indignant
seized
davis
who
told
them
being
perhaps
still
a
little
under
the
influence
of
the
punch
that
he
did
not
care
if
they
took
his
head
off
but
his
knew
a
more
profitable
way
of
being
revenged
than
that
and
sold
him
to
seignior
joffee
a
christian
black
soon
afterwards
captain
roberts
in

remained
behind
hoping
to
save
some
of
his
valuables
which
were
in
the
but
on
june
a
crusal
or
corsair
appeared
in
the
harbour
which
roberts
five
companions
went
on
board
of
various
designs
were
made
by
the
corsair
captain
to
induce
roberts
to
come
aboard
eventually
an
englishman
named
dawes
a
native
of
saltash
in
cornwall
was
sent
ashore
he
had
served
for
eight
years
in

taken
out
of

a
short
time
previously

in

frank
style

dawes
like
a
dog
returning
to
his
vomit
went
on
board
again
eventually
a
party
of
the
corsair
landed
under
the
leadership
of
dawes
and
captured

him

berths
being
scarce
he
decided
to
go
on
the
account
and
in
september
rowed
out
of
port
royal
in
a
canoe
with
a
few
chosen
companions
they
began
piracy
in
a
small
way
by
paddling
along
the
coast
and
landing
at
night
to
break
into
a
house
or
two
and
robbing
these
of
anything
they
could
carry
away
at
last
at
dun
hole
they
found
what
they
were
looking
for
a
small
bermuda
sloop
lying
at
anchor
evans
stepped
aboard
and
informed
the
crew
of
the
sloop
that
he
was
captain
of
their
vessel
which
was
a
piece
of
news
they
knew
not
before
going
on
shore
evans
stood
treat
to
his
crew
at
the
village
inn
spending
three
pistols
on
liquid
refreshment
he
so
took
the
fancy
of
the
publican
by
his
ways
that
he
was
invited
to
call
again
this
evans
and
his
companions
did
in
the
middle
of
the
same
night
and
rifled
the
house
and
took
away
all
they
could
carry
aboard
their
sloop
mounting
four
guns
and
christening
their
little
vessel
the
they
set
sail
for
hispaniola
good
luck
immediately
followed
as
on
the
very
next
day
they
took
their
first
prize
a
spanish
sloop
an
extraordinarily
rich
prize
for
her
size
for
the
crew
were
able
to
share
a
sum
of
a
man
for
a
while
all
was
de
prize
after
prize
simply
falling
into
their
hands
but
an
unhappy
accident
was
soon
to
bring
an
end
to
evans
career
the
boatswain
was
a
noisy
surly
fellow
and
on
several
occasions
the
captain
had
words
with
him
about
his
disrespectful
behaviour
the
boatswain
on
one
of
these
occasions
so
far
forgot
himself
as
not
only
to
use
ill
language
to
his
captain
but
to
challenge
him
to
a
fight
on
the
next
shore
they
came
to
with
pistol
and
sword
on
reaching
land
the
cowardly
boatswain
refused
to
go
ashore
or
to
fight
whereupon
the
captain
took
his
cane
and
gave
him
a
hearty
drubbing
when
the
boatswain
all
of
a
sudden
drawing
a
pistol
shot
evans
through
the
head
so
that
he
fell
down
dead
thus
was
brought
to
a
tragic
and
sudden
end
a
career
that
showed
early
signs
of
great
promise
the
boatswain
jumped
overboard
and
swam
for
the
shore
but
a
boat
put
off
and
brought
him
back
to
the
vessel
a
trial
was
at
once
held
but
the
chief
gunner
unable
to
bear
with
the
slow
legal
procedure
any
further
stepped
forward
and
shot
the
prisoner
dead
the
crew
of
thirty
men
now
shared
their
plunder
of
some
and
broke
up
each
going
his
own
way

was
anchored
off

with
a
brigantine
which
he
had

captured
this
was
more
than
the

could
tolerate
so
he
at
once
set
out
in
a
small
vessel
with
fifty
picked
men
the
sloop
was
boarded
at
midnight
but
everson

a

by
leaping
overboard

swimming
to
the

most
of
the

had
the
good
sense
to
retire
he
was

up

quarters
at

and
was
known
amongst
the
english
as
peter
the
great
his
name
will
go
down
to
posterity
for
his
bold
and
insolent
action
when
in
a
small
open
boat
with
a
handful
of
men
he
seized
a
great
spanish
galleon
pierre
had
been
out
on

in

one
ship
bigger
than
the

was
observed
sailing
at
some
little
distance
behind

the
mad
idea
entered
the
head
of
the
now
desperate
pirate
to
take
this
ship
the
pirates
all
took
an
oath
to
their
captain
to
fight
without
fear
and
never
to
surrender
it
was
dusk
and
in
these
tropical
latitudes
night
follows
day
very
quickly
before
the
attack
orders
were
given
to
the
surgeon
to
bore
a
hole
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
so
that
it
would
quickly
sink
thus
taking
away
any
hope
of
escape
should
the
enterprise
fail
this
was
done
and
the
boat
was
paddled
quietly
alongside
the
great
warship
when
the
crew
armed
only
with
a
pistol
and
a
sword
clambered
up
the
sides
and
jumped
aboard
quickly
and
silently
the
sleeping
helmsman
was
killed
while
pierre
and
a
party
of

men
ran
down
into

cabin

they
surprised

pierre
knew
as
scarcely
any
other
successful
pirate
or
gambler
ever
did
the
right
moment
to
stop
he
at
once
put
ashore
all
the
prisoners
he
did
not
want
for
working
the
ship
and
sailed
straight
back
to
france
where
he
lived
the
rest
of
his
life
in
comfortable
obscurity
and
never
again

the
news
of
this
exploit
spread
rapidly
over
the
west
indies
and
caused
the
greatest
excitement
amongst
the
pirate
fraternity
of
tortuga
and
hispaniola
men
left
their
work
of
killing
and
drying
beef
while
others
deserted
their
plantations
to
go
on
the
spaniards
in
much
the
same
way
as
men
went
to
a
gold
rush
years
after
those
who
had
no
boat
would
venture
forth
in

indian
pirate
born
in

of
prisoners
who
had
been
sent
there
as
slaves
by
cromwell
most
of
these
slaves
were
natives
of
scotland
and
ireland
and
owing
to
their
bare
knees
generally
went
by
the
name
of
red
legs
young
greaves
was
left
an
orphan
but
had
a
kind
master
and
a
good
education

clambered
on
to
the
wrong
ship
a
pirate
vessel
commanded
by
a
notoriously
cruel
pirate
called
captain
hawkins
finding
himself
driven
to
the
calling
of
piracy
greaves
became
very
efficient
and
quickly
rose
to
eminence
he
was
remarkable
for
his
dislike
of
unnecessary
bloodshed
torture
of
prisoners
and
killing
of
these
extraordinary
views
brought
about
a
duel
between
himself
and
his
captain
in
which
the
former
was
victorious
and
he
was
at
once
elected
commander
greaves
now
entered
a
period
of
the
highest
piratical
success
but
always
preserved
very
strictly
his
reputation
for
humanity
and
morality
he
never
tortured
his
prisoners
nor
ever
robbed
the
poor
nor
maltreated
women
his
greatest
success
of
all
was
his
capture
of
the
island
of
margarita
off
the
coast
of
venezuela
on
this
occasion
after
capturing
the
spanish
fleet
he
turned
the
guns
of
their
warships
against
the
forts
which
he
then
stormed
and
was
rewarded
by
a
huge
booty
of
pearls
and
gold
red
legs
then
retired
to
the
respectable
life
of
a
planter
in
the
island
of
nevis
but
was
one
day
denounced
as
a
pirate
by
an
old
seaman
he
was
cast
into
a
dungeon
to
await
execution
when
the
great
earthquake
came
which
destroyed
and
submerged
the
town
in
and
one
of
the
few
survivors
was
greaves
he
was
picked
up
by
a
whaler
on
board
of
which
he
served
with
success
and
later
on
for
his
assistance
in
capturing
a
gang
of
pirates
he
received
pardon
for
his
earlier
crimes
he
again
retired
to
a
plantation

was
noted
for
his
many
acts
of

halsey
captain
john
this
famous
south
sea
pirate
was
born
on
march
at
boston
and
received
a
commission
from
the
governor
of
massachusetts
to
cruise
as
a
privateer
on
the
banks
no
sooner
was
he
out
of
sight
of
land
than
halsey
turned
pirate
taking
a
ship
or
two
he
sailed
to
the
canary
islands
picking
up
a
rich
spanish
ship
there
he
next
doubled
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
paid
a
call
on
the
brethren
at
madagascar
he
then
sailed
to
the
red
sea
another
happy
hunting
ground
of
the
pirates
and
met
a
big
dutch
ship
armed
with
sixty
guns
halsey
astounded
his
men
by
announcing
his
sudden
determination
to
attack
only
moorish
ships
in
the
future
the
indignant
crew
mutinied
threw
captain
halsey
and
his
chief
gunner
in
irons
and
proceeded
to
attack
the
dutchman
the
mutinous
pirates
got
the
worst
of
the
encounter
and
released
halsey
who
only
just
managed
to
get
his
ship
away
luck
seems
to
have
deserted
halsey
for
a
while
for
not
a
moorish
ship
could
he
meet
with
so
much
so
that
his
scruples
against
taking
christian
ships
eased
enough
to
permit
him
to
bag
a
brace
of
english
ships
the
and
the
the
captain
of
the
former
proved
to
be
a
very
old
and
dear
friend
of
halsey
quartermaster
and
to
show
a
friendly
feeling
halsey
allowed
the
captain
to
keep
all
his
personal
belongings
nevertheless
they
took
a
comfortable
booty
comprising
some
fifty
thousand
pounds
in
english
gold
out
of
the
and
another
ten
thousand
out
of
the
the
pirates
being
strict
business
men
produced
invoices
and
sold
the
two
ships
back
to
their
legal
owners
for
cash
and
having
settled
this
affair
to
everybody
satisfaction
halsey
and
his
consort
returned
to
madagascar
here
they
were
visited
by
the
captain
of
a
scotch
ship
the
which
had
come
to
trade
liquor
probably
rum
but
possibly
whisky
with
the
pirates
a
sudden
hurricane
arose
destroying
both
the
pirate
ships
and
damaging
the
halsey
ever
a
man
of
resource
thereupon
seized
the
scotch
ship
and
with
even
greater
enterprise
at
once
attacked
a
ship
the
which
lay
at
anchor
which
was
loaded
with
stolen
merchandise
which
the
pirates
had
only
just
sold
to
the
captain
of
the
and
for
which
they
had
been
paid
the
end
was
now
drawing
near
for
in
captain
halsey
was
taken
ill
of
some
tropical
fever
and
died
he
was
a
popular
commander
respected
ever
loved
by
his
men
for
he
was
a
humane
man
never
killing
his
prisoners
unless
necessity
compelled
a
contemporary
eyewitness
of
his
funeral
rites
leaves
the
following
account
of
his
burial
with
great
solemnity
the
prayers
of
the
church
of
england
being
read
over
him
and
his
sword
and
pistols
laid
on
his
coffin
which
was
covered
with
a
ship
jack
as
many
minute
guns
were
fired
as
he
was
old
and
three
english
vollies
and
one
french
volley
of
small
arms
the
chronicler
continues
his
grave
was
made
in
a
garden
of
watermelons
and
fenced
in
to
prevent
his
being
rooted
up
by
wild
pigs
this
last
a
truly
touching
thought
on
the
part
of
the
bereaved
haman
captain
john
he
lived
all
alone
with
his
wife
and
family
on
a
small
and
otherwise
uninhabited
island
in
the
bahamas
about
the
year
he
sailed
into

harbour
in

sloop
intending

settle
there

writing

haman
johnson
tells
us
his
livelihood
and
constant
employment
was
to
plunder
and
pillage
the
spaniards
whose
sloops
and
launces
he
had
often
surprised
about
cuba
and
hispaniola
and
sometimes
brought
off
a
considerable
booty
always
escaping
by
a
good
pair
of
heels
insomuch
that
it
became
a
to
say
goes
john
haman
catch
him
if
you
can
his
business
to
providence
now
was
to
bring
his
family
there
in
order
to
live
and
settle
being
weary
perhaps
of
living
in
that
solitude
or
else
apprehensive
if
any
of
the
spaniards
should
discover
his
habitation
they
might
land
and
be
revenged
of
him
for
all
his
pranks

the
pirates
described
the

as
being
a
veritable

indeed
it
must
have
been
prior

right
into
the
central
square
of
the
city
without
being
observed
by
the
spaniards

completely
by

that
the

soon
masters

the
city

for
sixteen
hours
they

oppression
of

the
marauders
and
wanted
to
massacre
the
prisoners
particularly
the
religious
but
when
they
understood
that
the
buccaneers
were
not
remaining
in
granada
they
thought
better
of
it
having
no
doubt
a
shrewd
inkling
of
what
to
expect
in
the
future
when
their
rescuers
had
left

but
jefferys
had
made
such
friends
on
the
pirate
ship
that
he
was
too
drunk
to
go
and
also
was
abusive
in
his
cups
telling
his
hosts
there
was
not

for
this
he
received
six
lashes

jennings
captain
this
welsh
pirate
had
been
a
man
of
good
position
education
and
property
before
he
took
to
piracy
which
he
did
for
the
love
of
the
life
and
not
from
necessity
he
was
held
in
high
esteem
by
his
at
their
stronghold
in
the
bahamas
when
notice
was
brought
of
king
george
pardon
in
a
meeting
was
held
of
all
the
pirates
at
which
jennings
presided
after
much
discussion
jennings
boldly
gave
out
that
he
himself
meant
to
surrender
whereupon
some
hundred
and
fifty
other
pirates
declared
their
intention
of
doing
likewise
on
the
new
governor
arrival
from
england
they
received
their
certificates
though
the
greater
part
of
them
soon
went
back
to
piracy
or
to
quote
the
expressive
captain
johnson
returned
again
like
the
dog
to
the
vomit
jobson
richard
or
cobson
or
gopson
his
original
calling
was
that
of
a
druggist
assistant
in
london
he
combined
piracy
with
the
study
of
divinity
he
was
one
of
dampier
party
which
crossed
the
isthmus
of
darien
in
and
was
left
behind
with
wafer
who
tells
us
in
his
book
that
gopson
was
an
ingenious
man
and
a
good
scholar
and
had
with
him
a
greek
testament
which
he
frequently
read
and
would
translate
extempore
into
english
to
such
of
the
company
as
were
disposed
to
hear
him
after
great
sufferings
in
the
tropical
jungle
in
the
wet
season
jobson
and
his
friends
reached
the
north
sea
to
find
an
english
buccaneer
vessel
lying
at
anchor
off
the
shore
on
rowing
out
to
the
ship
the
canoe
upset
and
jobson
and
his
gun
were
thrown
overboard
but
the
former
was
rescued
though
he
died
a
few
days
later
on
board
the
vessel
owing
to
the
exposure
he
had
been
subjected
to
he
was
buried

le
capitaine
a

filibuster
who

his
headquarters
in

he
commanded
the
a
ship
armed
with
eighteen
guns
and
a
crew
of
men
johnson
captain
a
successful
and
very
bloody
pirate
of
jamaica
immediately
after
the
publication
of
peace
by
sir
thomas
lynch
governor
of
jamaica
in
which
included
a
general
pardon
to
all
privateers
johnson
fled
from
port
royal
with
some
ten
followers
and
shortly
after
meeting
with
a
spanish
ship
of
eighteen
guns
managed
to
take
her
and
kill
the
captain
and
fourteen
of
the
crew
gradually
collecting
together
a
party
of
a
hundred
or
more
english
and
french
desperadoes
he
plundered
many
ships
round
the
cuban
coast
tiring
of
his
quarrelsome
french
companions
he
sailed
to
jamaica
to
make
terms
with
the
governor
and
anchored
in
morant
bay
but
his
ship
was
blown
ashore
by
a
hurricane
johnson
was
immediately
arrested
by
governor
lynch
who
ordered
colonel
modyford
to
assemble
the
justices
and
to
proceed
to
trial
and
immediate
execution
lynch
had
had
bitter
experiences
of
trying
pirates
and
knew
that
the
sooner
they
were
hanged
the
better
but
modyford
like
many
other
jamaicans
felt
a
strong
sympathy
for
the
pirates
and
he
managed
to
get
johnson
acquitted
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
johnson
confessed
enough
to
hang
a
hundred
honester
persons
it
is
interesting
to
read
that
half
an
hour
after
the
dismissal
of
the
court
johnson
came
to
drink
with
his
judges
governor
lynch
now
thoroughly
roused
took
the
matter
into
his
own
hands
he
again
placed
johnson
under
arrest
called
a
meeting
of
the
council
from
which
he
dismissed
colonel
modyford
and
managed
to
have
the
former
judgment
reversed
the
pirate
was
again
tried
and
in
order
that
no
mistake
might
happen
lynch
himself
presided
over
the
court
johnson
as
before
made
a
full
confession
but
was
condemned
and
immediately
executed
and
was
writes
lynch
as
much
regretted
as
if
he
had
been
as
pious
and
as
innocent
as
one
of
the
primitive
martyrs
this
second
trial
was
absolutely
illegal
and
lynch
was
reproved
by
the
king
for
his
rash
and
conduct
johnson
captain
ben
when
a
lad
he
had
served
as
a
midshipman
in
an
east
indiaman
the
but
having
been
caught
robbing
the
purser
of
brandy
and
wine
he
was
flogged
and
sent
to
serve
as
a
sailor
before
the
mast
in
while
in
the
red
sea
he
deserted
his
ship
and
entered
the
service
of
the
sultan
of
ormus
finding
johnson
to
be
a
clever
sailor
the
sultan
appointed
him
admiral
of
his
pirate
fleet
of
fourteen
vessels
the
young
admiral
became
a
convert
to
brahminism
and
was
ceremoniously
blessed
by
the
of
the
temple
amongst
his
crew
johnson
had
some
two
hundred
other
englishmen
who
also
became
followers
of
brahmin
each
of
whom
was
allowed
when
in
port
a
dancing
girl
from
the
temple
johnson
proved
a
most
capable
and
bloodthirsty
pirate
playing
havoc
with
the
shipping
of
the
red
sea
taking
also
several
towns
on
the
coast
and
putting
to
death
his
prisoners
often
after
cruel
tortures
his
boldest
exploit
was
to
attack
the
fortified
town
of
busrah
this
he
did
putting
the
sheik
and
most
of
the
inhabitants
to
death
and
taking
back
to
his
master
the
sultan
vast
plunder
of
diamonds
pearls
and
gold
on
another
occasion
johnson
landed
his
crews
on
the
island
of
omalee
at
the
entrance
to
the
persian
gulf
a
favourite
place
of
pilgrimage
and
raided
the
temples
of
the
indian
god
buddha
putting
to
death
all
the
two
thousand
priests
he
cut
off
the
noses
and
slit
the
upper
lips
of
seven
hundred
dancing
girls
only
sparing
a
few
of
the
best
looking
ones
whom
he
carried
away
with
him
along
with
plunder
worth
half
a
million
rupees
on
their
way
back
to
the
red
sea
the
pirates
met
with
an
english
east
indiaman
which
they
took
and
plundered
and
johnson
remembering
his
previous
sufferings
in
the
same
service
murdered
the
whole
crew
shortly
afterwards
johnson
and
ten
of
his
english
officers
contrived
to
run
away
from
their
master
the
sultan
in
his
best
and
fastest
lateen
vessel
with
an
enormous
booty
sailing
up
to
the
head
of
the
persian
gulf
johnson
managed
to
reach
constantinople
with
his
share
of
the
plunder
worth
with
this
as
an
introduction
he
was
hospitably
received
and
was
made
a
bashaw
and
at
the
end
of
a
long
life
of
splendour
died
a
natural
death
johnson
captain
henry
henriques
the
englishman
a
west
indian
pirate
born
in
the
north
of
ireland
commanded
the
a
rhode
sloop
eighteen
guns
crew
of
ninety
mostly
spaniards
on
march
he
took
the
and
edward
burt
master
from
jamaica
off
swan
island
the
and
was
armed
with
eight
carriage
and
ten
swivel
guns
and
a
crew
of
only
men
after
a
gallant
resistance
for
five
hours
the
pirates
boarded
and
took
the
english
ship
the
few
survivors
were
stripped
naked
and
preparations
made
to
hang
them
in
pairs
this
was
prevented
by
captain
johnson
and
an
english
pirate
called
echlin
there
was
a
groves
a
passenger
in
the
and
whose
husband
and
the
english
surgeon
had
both
been
killed
at
the
first
onslaught
of
the
pirates
this
poor
lady
was
hidden
in
the
hold
of
the
ship
during
the
action
and
was
only
informed
afterwards
of
the
death
of
her
husband
the
pirates
now
dragged
her
on
deck
stript
her
in
a
manner
naked
and
carried
her
as
a
prize
to
the
spanish
captain
pedro
poleas
who
immediately
took
her
to
the
great
cabin
and
there
with
horrible
oaths
and
curses
insolently
assaulted
her
chastity
her
loud
cries
of
distress
brought
captain
johnson
into
the
cabin
who
seeing
what
was
on
hand
drew
his
pistol
and
threatened
to
blow
out
the
brains
of
any
man
who
attempted
the
least
violence
upon
her
he
next
commanded
everything
belonging
to
groves
to
be
returned
to
her
which
was
done
including
her
clothing
the
gallant
conduct
of
johnson
is
the
more
surprising
and
pleasing
since
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
as
bloody
and
ruthless
a
pirate
as
ever
took
a
ship
or
cut
an
innocent
throat
he
only
had
one
hand
and
used
to
fire
his
piece
with
great
skill
laying
the
barrel
on
his
stump
and
drawing
the
trigger
with
his
right
hand
in
all
the
american
plantations
there
were
rewards
offered
for
him
alive
or
dead
the
end
of
this
pirate
is
unrecorded
but
was
probably
a
violent
one
as
this
type
of
pirate
seldom
if
ever
died
in
his
bed

captain

probably
few
persons
even
in

britain
would
call
paul
jones
a
pirate
but
this
was
not
always
the
case
in
all
books
on
pirates
written
shortly
after

american
war
paul
jones
figured
as
a
notorious
character
this
famous
privateer
let

call
him
was
born
at
kirkcudbright
in
scotland
in
the
son
of
paul
head
gardener
to
lord
selkirk
and
was
christened
john
paul
so
much
has
been
written
about
this
man
in
books
easily
procurable
for
reference
that
little
need
be
said
about
him
here
starting
life
as
a
sailor
before
the
mast
he
quickly
showed
abilities
which
led
to
his
promotion
to
the
rank
of
mate
in
an
english
ship
trading
in
the
west
india
islands
and
later
he
was
made
master
on
the
declaration
of
war
with
america
jones
joined
the
rebels
and
was
given
command
of
a
privateer
and
from
he
became
a
terror
to
english
shipping
around
the
british
isles
one
of
his
most
startling
exploits
was
his
surprise
visit
in
his
ship
the
to
his
old
home
with
the
object
of
kidnapping

as
a
pickpocket

housebreaker
in

he
was
captain
roberts
lieutenant
and
was
afterwards
given
command
of
a
prize
the
kennedy
could
never
even
when
a
captain
forget
his
old
trade
it
is
recorded
that
he
stole
a
black
suit
of
clothes
from
the
captain
of
the
at
sierra
leone
in
these
he
put
on
with
the

then
swaggered
about

these
till
his
drenched
him
with
buckets
of

so
that
he
had
to
disrobe
and

garments
overboard
owing
to
a
quarrel
with
captain
roberts
kennedy
went
off
in
his
ship
the
and
sailed
to
barbadoes
his
first
prize
a
boston
ship
was
a
distinct
novelty
being
commanded
by
one
captain
knot
a
quaker
who
lived
up
to
the
principles
of
his
sect
by
allowing
no
pistol
sword
or
cutlass
or
other
weapon
aboard
his
vessel
the
crew
finding
kennedy
had
no
knowledge
whatever
of
navigation
threatened
to
throw
him
overboard
but
because
he
was
a
man
of
great
personal
courage
they
did
not
in
the
end
carry
out
their
threat
the
crew
next
decided
to
give
over
piracy
and
to
set
sail
for
ireland
this
island
they
altogether
missed
through
bad
navigation
and
they
ran
the
ship
ashore
on
the
north
of
scotland
the
crew
landed
and
passed
themselves
off
as
shipwrecked
mariners
but
owing
to
their
drinking
and
rioting
in
each
village
they
came
to
the
whole
countryside
was
soon
roused
kennedy
slipped
away
and
reached

soon
spent
all
his
gains

piracy
kennedy
turned
king

his
old

age
kidd
captain
william
sometimes
robert
kidd
or
kid
in
the
whole
history
of
piracy
there
is
no
name
that
has
so
taken
the
world
fancy
than
has
that
of
william
kidd
and
yet
if
he
be
judged
by
his
actions
as
a
pirate
he
must
be
placed
amongst
the
or
even
masters
of
that
craft
he
took
but
two
or
three
ships
and
these
have
been
after
two
hundred
years
proved
to
be
lawful
prizes
taken
in
his
legal
capacity
as
a
privateer
kidd
was
born
at
greenock
in
scotland
about
the
year
and
was
the
son
of
the
rev
john
kidd
of
his
early
life
little
record
is
left
but
we
know
that
in
august
he
arrived
at
nevis
in
the
west
indies
in
command
of
a
privateer
of
sixteen
guns
in
while
kidd
was
on
shore
his
crew
ran
away
with
his
ship
which
was
not
surprising
as
most
of
his
crew
were
old
pirates
but
that
kidd
was
an
efficient
seaman
and
a
capable
captain
is
shown
by
the
number
of
times
he
was
given
the
command
of
different
privateer
vessels
both
by
the
government
of
new
york
and
by
privateer
owners
in
kidd
was
in
london
and
on
october
signed
the
articles
which
were
to
prove
so
fatal
for
him
in
january
king
william
iii
issued
to
his
beloved
friend
william
kidd
a
commission
to
apprehend
certain
pirates
particularly
thomas
tew
of
rhode
island
thomas
wake
and
william
maze
of
new
york
john
ireland
and
all
other
pirates
and
sea
rovers
of
what
nature
soever
this
privateer
enterprise
was
financed
chiefly
by
lord
bellomont
but
the
other
adventurers
on
shore
and
in
safety
were
the
lord
chancellor
the
earl
of
orford
the
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
the
earl
of
romney
and
the
duke
of
shrewsbury
secretaries
of
state
robert
livingston
of
new
york
and
lastly
captain
kidd
himself
the
ship
the
galley
was
bought
and
fitted
up
and
kidd
sailed
away
in
her
to
suppress
piracy
particularly
on
the
coast
of
america
nothing
was
heard
of
him
till
august
when
ugly
rumours
began
to
get
about
of
piracies
committed
by
kidd
in
the
indian
ocean
in
december
of
the
same
year
a
general
pardon
was
offered
to
all
pirates
who
should
surrender
themselves
with
two
exceptions
namely
captain
avery
and
captain
kidd
in
may
kidd
suddenly
appeared
in
a
small
vessel
at
new
york
with
rich
booty
his
chief
patron
lord
bellomont
was
now
governor
and
was
placed
in
the
most
awkward
position
of
having
to
carry
out
his
orders
and
arrest
kidd
for
piracy
and
send
him
in
chains
to
england
in
which
ship
had
been
sent
specially
to
new
york
to
carry
back
kidd
bradish
and
other
pirates
to
england
the
trial
of
kidd
proved
a
scandal
for
someone
had
to
suffer
as
scapegoat
for
the
aristocratic
company
privateers
and
the
lot
fell
to
the
luckless
kidd
kidd
was
charged
with
piracy
and
with
murder
the
first
charge
of
seizing
two
ships
of
the
great
mogul
could
have
been
met
by
the
production
of
two
documents
which
kidd
had
taken
out
of
these
ships
and
which
he
claimed
proved
that
the
ships
were
sailing
under
commissions
issued
by
the
french
east
india
company
and
made
them
perfectly
lawful
prizes
these
commissions
kidd
had
most
foolishly
handed
over
to
lord
bellomont
and
they
could
not
be
produced
at
the
trial
although
they
had
been
exhibited
before
the
house
of
commons
a
little
while
previously
it
is
an
extraordinary
and
tragic
fact
that
these
two
documents
so
vital
to
kidd
were
discovered
only
lately
in
the
public
records
office
too
late
by
some
years
to
save
an
innocent
man
life
as
it
happened
the
charge
of
which
kidd
was
hanged
for
was
murder
and
ran
thus
being
moved
and
seduced
by
the
instigations
of
the
devil
he
did
make
an
assault
in
and
upon
william
moore
upon
the
high
seas
with
a
certain
wooden
bucket
bound
with
iron
hoops
of
the
value
of
eight
pence
giving
the
said
william
moore
one
mortal
bruise
of
which
the
aforesaid
william
moore
did
languish
and
die
this
aforesaid
william
moore
was
gunner
in
the
galley
and
was
mutinous
and
kidd
as
captain
was
perfectly
justified
in
knocking
him
down
and
even
of
killing
him
but
as
the
court
meant
kidd
to
swing
this
was
quite
good
enough
for
finding
him
guilty
the
unfortunate
prisoner
was
executed
at
wapping
on
may
and
his
body
afterwards
hanged
in
chains
at
tilbury

a
popular
ballad
was
sung
to
commemorate
the
life
and
death
of
kidd
who
for
some
reason
was
always
called
robert
kidd
by
the
populace
it
consists
of
no
less
than
verses

an
old
massachusetts
pirate
who
retired
from
the
sea
and
was
settled
in
boston
in
his
wife
gave
information
to
the
governor
the
earl
of
bellomont
of
the
whereabouts
of
a
pirate
called
gillam
who
was
wanted
koxinga
his
real
name
was
yeh
koxinga
being
the
portuguese
version
the
son
of
a
chinese
pirate
cheng
by
a
japanese
mother
he
was
born
in
from
early
youth
koxinga
was
inspired
with
a
hatred
of
the
manchus
who
had
imprisoned
his
father
the
young
pirate
soon
became
so
successful
in
his
raids
along
the
coast
of
china
that
the
emperor
resorted
to
the
extraordinary
expedient
of
ordering
the
inhabitants
of
more
than
eighty
seaboard
towns
to
migrate
ten
miles
inland
after
destroying
their
homes
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
koxinga
was
a
pirate
worked
solely
for
his
own
ambitious
ends
and
to
satisfy
his
revengeful
feelings
but
the
fact
that
he
fought
against
the
alien
conquerors
the
dutch
in
formosa
and
defeated
them
caused
him
to
be
regarded
as
a
hero
pirate
his
father
was
executed
at
peking
which
only
increased
his
bitterness
against
the
reigning
house
koxinga
made
himself
what
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
the
ruler
of
formosa
and
the
island
became
through
him
part
of
the
chinese
empire
after
his
death
which
took
place
in
he
received
official
canonization

this
made
no

grew
more

more
rich

insolent
the

then
secured
an

early
life
to

the

of
their
farthings
and
as
he
grew
bigger
used
to
gamble
with
the
footmen
who
waited
in
the
lobby
of
the
house
of
commons
while
still
quite
small
one
of
his
elder
brothers
used
to
carry
little
edward
hidden
in
a
basket
on

back
and
when
in
a
crowd
the
future
pirate
would
from
above
snatch
the
hats
and
even
the
wigs
off
the
heads
of
passing
citizens
and
secret
them
in
the
basket
and
so
get
away
with
them
the
low
family
were
the
originators
of
this
ingenious
and
fascinating
trick
and
for
a
time
it
was
most
successful
until
the
people
of
the
city
took
to
tying
on
their
hats
and
wigs
with
bands
to
prevent
their
sudden
removal
when
he
grew
up
ned
went
to
boston
and
earned
an
honest
living
as
a
rigger
but
after
a
while
he
tired
of
this
and
sailed
in
a
sloop
to
honduras
to
steal
here
low
quarrelled
with
his
captain
tried
to
shoot
him
and
then
went
off
in
an
open
boat
with
twelve
other
men
and
the
very
next
day
they
took
a
small
vessel
in
which
they
began
their
war
against
all
the
world
low
soon
happened
to
meet
with
captain
lowther
the
pirate
and
the
two
agreed
to
sail
in
company
this
partnership
lasted
until
may
when
they
took
a
prize
a
brigantine
from
boston
which
low
went
into
with
a
crew
of
men
this
vessel
they
armed
with
two
guns
four
swivels
and
six
of
powder
and
saying
to
lowther
sailed
off
on
their
own
account
a
week
later
a
prize
fell
into
their
hands
which
was
the
first
of
several
things
soon
became
too
hot
for
low
along
the
american
coast
and
the
west
indies
as
several
were
searching
for
him
so
he
sailed
to
the
azores
taking
on
his
way
a
big
french
ship
of
guns
and
later
in
the
harbour
of
michael
he
seized
several
vessels
which
he
found
at
anchor
there
here
they
burnt
the
french
ship
but
let
the
crew
all
go
except
the
cook
who
they
said
being
a
greasy
fellow
would
fry
well
in
the
fire
so
the
poor
man
was
bound
to
the
main
mast
and
burnt
in
the
ship
to
the
no
small
derision
of
low
and
his
mirmidons
low
and
his
crew
now
began
to
treat
their
prisoners
with
great
brutality
however
on
one
occasion
the
biter
was
bitten
it
happened
that
one
of
the
drunken
crew
playfully
cutting
at
a
prisoner
missed
his
mark
and
accidentally
slashed
captain
low
across
his
lower
jaw
the
sword
opening
his
cheek
and
laying
bare
his
teeth
the
surgeon

called
who
at
once
stitched
up
the
wound
but
low
found
some
fault
with
the
operation
as
well
he
might
seeing
that
the
surgeon
was
tollerably
drunk
at
the
time
the
surgeon
professional
pride
was
outraged
by
this
criticism
of
his
skill
by
a
layman
and
he
showed
his
annoyance
in
a
ready
if
unprofessional
manner
by
striking
low
such
a
blow
with
his
fists
that
broke
out
all
the
stitches
and
then
bid
him
sew
up
his
chops
himself
and
be
damned
so
that
the
captain
made
a
very
pitiful
figure
for
some
time
after
low
took
a
large
number
of
prizes
but
he
was
not
a
sympathetic
figure
and
the
list
of
his
prizes
and
brutalities
soon
becomes
irksome
reading
low
still
in
the
and
accompanied
by
captain
harris
in
the
then
sailed
back
to
the
west
indies
and
later
to
south
carolina
where
he
took
several
prizes
one
the
captain
willard
belonging
to
new
england
and
as
low
never
missed
an
opportunity
of
showing
his
dislike
of
all
new
englanders
he
sent
the
captain
away
with
both
his
ears
cut
off
and
with
various
other
wounds
about
his
body
low
and
harris
now
made
a
most
unfortunate
mistake
in
giving
chase
to
a
ship
which
on
close
quarters
proved
to
be
not
a
merchant
vessel
but
after
a
short
fight
the
coward
low
slipped
away
and
left
his
consort
harris
to
carry
on
an
unequal
contest
until
he
was
compelled
to
surrender
his
ship
low
cruelties
became
more
and
more
disgusting
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
he
was
really
by
this
time
a
lunatic
in
july
low
took
a
new
ship
for
himself
naming
himself
admiral
and
sporting
a
new
black
flag
with
a
red
skeleton
upon
it
he
again
cruised
off
the
azores
the
canaries
and
the
guinea
coast
but
what
the
end
was
of
this
repulsive
uninteresting
and
bloody
pirate
has
never
been
known
lowther
captain
george
sailed
as
second

belonging
to

of
thirty
men
on
board
as
passengers
were
captain
massey
and
a
number
of
soldiers
arriving
at
their
destination
massey
quarrelled
with
the
merchants
on
shore
and
a
few
days
later
with
lowther
seized
the
ship
which
he
renamed
the
they
now
went
their
first
prize
being
a
boston
ship
and
cruising
about
off
the
island
of
hispaniola
several
more
were
taken
but
nothing
very
rich
lowther
quarrelled
with
captain
massey
who
being
a
soldier
wished
to
land
on
some
island
to
plunder
the
french
settlements
but
this
was
not
agreed
to
and
massey
and
his
followers
were
sent
away
in
a
sloop
life
for
lowther
now
became
a
series
of
successes
prizes
being
taken
and
visits
to
land
being
occasionally
made
for
the
crew
to
enjoy
a
drunken
revel
having
met
with
captain
low
for
a
while
the
two
sailed
together
and
took
the
a
merchantman

several
more
rich
prizes

barely
escaped
in
a
sloop

their
lives

soon
improved
himself
by
seizing
a
brigantine
and
in
her
shaped
his
course
to
the
coast
of
south
carolina
a
favourite
resort
for
the
pirates
here
he
attacked
an
english
ship
but
was
so
roughly
handled
that
he
was
glad
to
run
his
ship
ashore
and
escape
in
he
steered
for

taking
many
small
vessels
there
and
returning
to

pressure
from
his
creditors
drove
de
lussan
into
buccaneering
as
being
a
rapid
method
of
gaining
enough
money
to
satisfy
them
and
to
enable
him
to
return
to
the
fashionable
life
he
loved
so
well
in
paris
de
lussan
was
according
to
his
own
account
a
man
of
the
highest
principles
and
very
religious
he
never
allowed
his
crew
to
molest
priests
nuns
or
churches
after
taking
a
spanish
town
the
fighting
being
over
he
would
lead
his
crew
of
pirates
to
attend
mass
in
the
church
and
when
this
was
done
and
not
until
then
would
he
allow
the
plundering
and
looting
to
begin
de
lussan
was
surprised
and
grieved
to
find
that
his
spanish
prisoners
had
a
most
exaggerated
idea
of
the
brutality
of
the
buccaneers
and
on
one
occasion
when
he
was
conducting
a
fair
young
spanish
lady
a
prisoner
to
a
place
of
safety
he
was
overwhelmed
when
he
discovered
that
the
reason
of
her
terror
was
that
she
believed
she
was
shortly
to
be
eaten
by
him
and
his
crew
to
remedy
this
erroneous
impression
it
was
the
custom
of
the
french
commander
to
gather
together
all
his
prisoners
into
the
church
or
the
plaza
and
there
to
give
them
a
lecture
on
the
true
life
and
character
of
the
buccaneers
the
student
who
wishes
to
learn
more
about
the
adventures
of

interesting

particulars
about
the
filibuster
surprising
and
romantic
affair
with
the
beautiful
and
wealthy
spanish
widow

fell
so
violently
in
love
with
him
it
happened
on
one
occasion
that
raveneau
and
his
crew
having
taken
a
town
on
the
west
coast
of
south
america
after
a
somewhat
bloody
battle
had
as
usual
attended

setting
out
to

one
of
the
chief
houses
in
the
town

discovered
the
widow
of
the
late
town
treasurer
dissolved
in
tears
upon
which
the
tender
buccaneer
hastened
with
profound
apologies
discreetly
to
withdraw
but
calling
again
next
day
to
offer
his
sympathy
he
found
the
widow
had
forgotten
all
about
the
late
treasurer

she
had
fallen
violently
in

the

plausible
tale
of
how

deceived
the

of

as
much
as
he
deemed
wise
to
the

receiving
the
story
with
far
less
credulity
than
the
governor

returned
him

misson
captain
this
unique
pirate
came
of
an
ancient
french
family
of
provence
he
was
the
youngest
of
a
large
family
and
received
a
good
education
at
the
age
of
he
had
already
shown
unusual
distinction
in
the
subjects
of
humanity
and
logic
and
had
passed
quite
tolerably
in
mathematics
deciding
to
carve
a
fortune
for
himself
with
his
sword
he
was
sent
to
the
academy
at
angiers
for
a
year
and
at
the
conclusion
of
his
military
studies
his
father
would
have
bought
him
a
commission
in
a
regiment
of
musketeers
but
young
misson
had
been
reading
books
of
travel
and
begged
so
earnestly
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
sea
that
his
father
got
him
admitted
as
a
volunteer
on
the
french
commanded
by
monsieur
fourbin
joining
his
ship
at
marseilles
they
cruised
in
the
mediterranean
and
the
young
volunteer
soon
showed
great
keenness
in
his
duties
and
lost
no
opportunity
of
learning
all
he
could
about
navigation
and
the
construction
of
ships
even
parting
with
his
to
the
boatswain
and
the
carpenter
to
receive
special
instruction
from
them
arriving
one
day
at
naples
misson
obtained
permission
from
the
captain
to
visit
rome
a
visit
that
eventually
changed
his
whole
career
it
happened
that
while
in
rome
the
young
sailor
met
a
priest
a
signor
caraccioli
a
dominican
who
held
most
unclerical
views
about
the
priesthood
and
indeed
his
ideas
on
life
in
general
were
to
say
the
least
unorthodox
a
great
friendship
was
struck
up
between
these
two
which
at
length
led
the
priest
to
throw
off
his
habit
and
join
the
crew
of
the
two
days
out
from
port
they
met
and
fought
a
desperate
engagement
with
a
sallee
pirate
in
which
the
and
misson
both
distinguished
themselves
by
their
bravery
misson
next
voyage
was
in
a
privateer
the
and
meeting
one
day
an
english
ship
the
between
guernsey
and
start
point
the
merchantman
was
defeated
after
a
gallant
resistance
rejoining
the
misson
sailed
from
rochelle
to
the
west
indies
and
caraccioli
lost
no
opportunity
of
preaching
to
young
misson
the
gospel
of
atheism
and
communism
and
with
such
success
that
the
willing
convert
soon
held
views
as
extreme
as
those
of
his
teacher
these
two
apostles
now
began
to
talk
to
the
crew
and
their
views
particularly
on
the
rights
of
private
property
were
soon
held
by
almost
all
on
board
a
fortunate
event
happened
just
then
to
help
the
new
cause
meeting
with
an
english
the
off
the
island
of
martinique
a
smart
engagement
took
place
between
the
two
ships
at
the
very
commencement
of
which
captain
fourbin
and
three
of
the
officers
on
the
french
ship
were
killed
the
fight
ended
by
the
english
ship
blowing
up
and
an
era
of
may
be
said
to
have
now
begun
firstly
signor
caraccioli
stepping
forward
made
a
long
and
eloquent
address
to
misson
inviting
him
to
become
captain
of
the
and
calling
upon
him
to
follow
the
example
of
alexander
the
great
with
the
persians
and
that
of
the
kings
henry
iv
and
vii
of
england
reminding
him
how
mahomet
with
but
a
few
founded
the
ottoman
empire
also
how
darius
with
a
handful
of
companions
got
possession
of
persia
inflamed
by
this
speech
young
misson
showed
what
he
could
do
when
calling
all
hands
up
on
deck
he
made
his
first
but
as
events
proved
by
far
from
last
speech
the
result
was
a
triumph
of
oratory
the
excited
french
sailors
crying
out
vive
le
capitaine
misson
et
son
lieutenant
le
scavant
caraccioli
misson
returning
thanks
in
a
few
graceful
words
promised
to
do
his
utmost
as
their
commander
for
their
new
marine
republic
the
newly
elected
officers
retiring
to
the
great
cabin
a
friendly
discussion
began
as
to
their
future
arrangements
the
first
question
that
arose
was
to
choose
what
colours
they
should
sail
under
the
newly
elected
boatswain
mathew
le
tondu
a
brave
but
simple
mariner
advised
a
black
one
as
being
the
most
terrifying
this
brought
down
a
full
blast
of
eloquence
from
caraccioli
the
new
lieutenant
who
objected
that
they
were
no
pirates
but
men
who
were
resolved
to
affect
the
liberty
which
god
and
nature
gave
them
with
a
great
deal
about
guardians
of
the
peoples
rights
and
liberties
and
gradually
becoming
worked
up
gave
the
wretched
boatswain
who
must
have
regretted
his
unfortunate
remark
a
heated
lecture
on
the
soul
on
shaking
the
yoak
of
tyranny
off
their
necks
on
oppression
and
poverty
and
the
miseries
of
life
under
these
conditions
as
compared
to
those
of
pomp
and
dignity
in
the
end
he
showed
that
their
policy
was
not
to
be
one
of
piracy
for
pirates
were
men
of
no
principle
and
led
dissolute
lives
but
lives
were
to
be
brave
just
and
innocent
and
their
cause
the
cause
of
liberty
and
therefore
instead
of
a
black
flag
they
should
live
under
a
white
ensign
with
the
motto
for
god
and
liberty
embroidered
upon
it
the
simple
sailors
debarred
from
these
councils
had
gathered
outside
the
cabin
but
were
able
to
overhear
this
speech
and
at
its
conclusion
carried
away
by
enthusiasm
loud
cries
went
up
of
liberty
liberty
we
are
free
men
vive
the
brave
captain
misson
and
the
noble
lieutenant
caraccioli
alas
it
is
impossible
in
the
space
of
this
work
to
do
justice
to
the
perfectly
wonderful
and
idealistic
conditions
of
this
pirate
crew
their
speeches
and
their
kind
acts
follow
each
other
in
fascinating
profusion
we
can
only
recommend
those
who
feel
disposed
to
follow
more
closely
the
history
of
these
delightful
pirates
to
read
the
account
printed
in
english
in
if
they
are
fortunate
enough
to
come
by
a
copy
the
first
prize
taken
by
these
pirates
under
the
white
flag
was
an
english
sloop
commanded
by
one
captain
thomas
butler
only
a
day
sail
out
from
kitts
after
helping
themselves
to
a
couple
of
puncheons
of
rum
and
a
few
other
articles
which
the
pirates
needed
but
without
doing
any
unkindness
to
the
crew
nor
stripping
them
as
was
the
usual
custom
of
pirates
on
such
occasions
they
let
them
go
greatly
to
the
surprise
of
captain
butler
who
handsomely
admitted
that
he
had
never
before
met
with
so
much
candour
in
any
similar
situation
and
to
further
express
his
gratitude
he
ordered
his
crew
to
man
ship
and
at
parting
called
for
three
rousing
british
cheers
for
the
good
pirate
and
his
men
which
were
enthusiastically
given
sailing
to
the
coast
of
africa
misson
took
a
dutch
ship
the
of
amsterdam
the
cargo
was
found
to
consist
of
gold
dust
and
seventeen
slaves
in
the
latter
captain
misson
recognized
a
good
text
for
one
of
his
little
sermons
to
his
crew
so
calling
all
hands
on
deck
he
made
the
following
observations
on
the
vile
trade
of
slavery
telling
his
men
that
the
trading
for
those
of
our
own
species
cou
never
be
agreeable
to
the
eyes
of
divine
justice
that
no
man
had
power
of
the
liberty
of
another
and
while
those
who
profess
a
more
enlightened
knowledge
of
the
deity
sold
men
like
beasts
they
prov
that
their
religion
was
no
more
than
grimace
and
that
they
differ
from
the
barbarians
in
name
only
since
their
practice
was
in
nothing
more
humane
for
his
part
and
he
hop
he
spoke
the
sentiments
of
all
his
brave
companions
he
had
not
exempted
his
neck
from
the
galling
yoak
of
slavery
and
asserted
his
own
liberty
to
enslave
others
that
however
these
men
were
distinguished
from
the
europeans
by
their
colour
customs
or
religious
rites
they
were
the
work
of
the
same
omnipotent
being
and
endued
with
equal
reason
wherefore
he
desired
they
might
be
treated
like
freemen
for
he
banish
even
the
name
of
slavery
from
among
them
and
be
divided
into
messes
among
them
to
the
end
they
might
the
sooner
learn
their
language
be
sensible
of
the
obligations
they
had
to
them
and
more
capable
and
zealous
to
defend
that
liberty
they
owed
to
their
justice
and
humanity
this
speech
was
met
with
general
applause
and
once
again
the
good
ship
rang
with
cries
of
vive
le
capitaine
misson
the
negroes
were
freed
of
their
irons
dressed
up
in
the
clothes
of
their
late
dutch
masters
and
it
is
gratifying
to
read
that
by
their
gesticulations
they
shew
they
were
gratefully
sensible
of
their
being
delivered
from
their
chains
but
alas
a
sad
cloud
was
creeping
insidiously
over
the
fair
reputation
of
these
out
of
the
last
slave
ship
they
had
taken
a
number
of
dutch
sailors
had
volunteered
to
serve
with
misson
and
had
come
aboard
as
members
of
his
crew
hitherto
no
swearword
was
ever
heard
no
loose
or
profane
expression
had
pained
the
ears
of
captain
misson
or
his
lieutenant
but
the
dutch
mariners
began
to
lead
the
crew
into
ways
of
swearing
and
drunkenness
which
coming
to
the
captain
notice
he
thought
best
to
nip
these
weeds
in
the
bud
so
calling
both
french
and
dutch
upon
deck
and
desiring
the
dutch
captain
to
translate
his
remarks
into
the
dutch
language
he
told
them
that
before
he
had
the
misfortune
of
having
them
on
board
his
ears
were
never
grated
with
hearing
the
name
of
the
great
creator
profaned
tho
he
to
his
sorrow
had
often
since
heard
his
own
men
guilty
of
that
sin
which
administer
neither
profit
nor
pleasure
and
might
draw
upon
them
a
severe
punishment
that
if
they
had
a
just
idea
of
that
great
being
they
wou
never
mention
him
but
they
wou
immediately
reflect
on
his
purity
and
their
own
vileness
that
we
so
easily
took
impression
from
our
company
that
the
spanish
proverb
says
a
hermit
and
a
thief
live
together
the
thief
wou
become
hermit
or
the
hermit
thief
that
he
saw
this
verified
in
his
ship
for
he
cou
attribute
the
oaths
and
curses
he
had
heard
among
his
brave
companions
to
nothing
but
the
odious
example
of
the
dutch
that
this
was
not
the
only
vice
they
had
introduced
for
before
they
were
on
board
his
men
were
men
but
he
found
by
their
beastly
pattern
they
were
degenerated
into
brutes
by
drowning
that
only
faculty
which
distinguishes
between
man
and
beast
reason
that
as
he
had
the
honour
to
command
them
he
could
not
see
them
run
into
these
odious
vices
without
a
sincere
concern
as
he
had
a
paternal
affection
for
them
and
he
should
reproach
himself
as
neglectful
of
the
common
good
if
he
did
not
admonish
them
and
as
by
the
post
which
they
had
honour
him
he
was
obliged
to
have
a
watchful
eye
over
their
general
interest
he
was
obliged
to
tell
them
his
sentiments
were
that
the
dutch
allured
them
to
a
dissolute
way
of
life
that
they
might
take
some
advantage
over
them
wherefore
as
his
brave
companions
he
was
assured
wou
be
guided
by
reason
he
gave
the
dutch
notice
that
the
first
whom
he
catch
either
with
an
oath
in
his
mouth
or
liquor
in
his
head
should
be
brought
to
the
geers
whipped
and
pickled
for
an
example
to
the
rest
of
his
nation
as
to
his
friends
his
companions
his
children
those
gallant
those
generous
noble
and
heroick
souls
he
had
the
honour
to
command
he
entreated
them
to
allow
a
small
time
for
reflection
and
to
consider
how
little
pleasure
and
how
much
danger
might
flow
from
imitating
the
vices
of
their
enemies
and
that
they
would
among
themselves
make
a
law
for
the
suppression
of
what
would
otherwise
estrange
them
from
the
source
of
life
and
consequently
leave
them
destitute
of
his
protection
this
speech
had
the
desired
effect
and
ever
afterwards
when
any
one
of
the
crew
had
reason
to
mention
the
name
of
his
captain
he
never
failed
to
add
the
epithet
good
before
it
these
chaste
pirates
soon
took
and
plundered
many
rich
merchant
ships
but
always
in
the
most
gentlemanly
manner
so
that
none
failed
to
be
not
a
little
surprised
at
the
regularity
tranquillity
and
humanity
of
these
pyrates
from
out
of
one
of
these
an
english
vessel
they
took
a
sum
of
but
during
the
engagement
the
captain
was
killed
poor
captain
misson
was
over
this
unfortunate
mishap
and
to
show
as
best
he
could
his
regret
he
buried
the
body
on
shore
and
finding
that
one
of
his
men
was
by
trade
a
stonecutter
raised
a
monument
over
the
grave
with
engraved
upon
it
the
words
here
lies
a
gallant
and
at
the
conclusion
of
a
very
moving
burial
service
he
paid
a
final
tribute
by
a
triple
discharge
of
small
arms
and
fired
minute
guns
misson
now
sailed
to
the
island
of
johanna
in
the
indian
ocean
which
became
his
future
home
misson
married
the
sister
of
the
local
dusky
queen
and
his
lieutenant
led
to
the
altar
her
niece
while
many
of
the
crew
also
were
joined
in
holy
wedlock
to
one
or
more
ladies
of
more
humble
social
standing
already
misson
has
received
more
space
than
he
is
entitled
to
in
a
work
of
reference
of
this
kind
but
his
career
is
so
full
of
charming
incidents
that
one
is
tempted
to
continue
to
unseemly
length
let
it
suffice
to
say
that
for
some
years
misson
made
speeches
robbed
ships
and
now
and
again
when
unavoidably
driven
to
it
would
reluctantly
slaughter
his
enemies
finally
misson
took
his
followers
to
a
sheltered
bay
in
madagascar
and
on
landing
there
made
a
little
speech
telling
them
that
here
they
could
settle
down
build
a
town
that
here
in
fact
they
might
have
some
place
to
call
their
own
and
a
receptacle
when
age
or
wounds
had
render
them
incapable
of
hardship
where
they
might
enjoy
the
fruits
of
their
labour
and
go
to
their
graves
in
peace
this
ideal
colony
was
called
libertatia
and
was
run
on
strictly
socialistic
lines
for
no
one
owned
any
individual
property
all
money
was
kept
in
a
common
treasury
and
no
hedges
bounded
any
man
particular
plot
of
land
docks
were
made
and
fortifications
set
up
soon
misson
had
two
ships
built
called
the
and
the
and
these
were
sent
for
a
voyage
round
the
island
to
map
and
chart
the
coast
and
to
train
the
released
slaves
to
be
efficient
sailors
a
session
house
was
built
and
a
form
of
government
arranged
at
the
first
meeting
misson
was
elected
lord
conservator
as
they
called
the
president
for
a
term
of
three
years
and
during
that
period
he
was
to
have
all
the
ensigns
of
royalty
to
attend
him

while
the

was
formed
of

amongst

without
distinction
of
nation
or
colour
the
difficulty
of
language
as
french
english
portuguese
and
dutch
were
equally
spoken
was
overcome
by
the
invention
of
a
new
language
a
kind
of
esperanto
which
was
built
up
of
words
from
all
four
for
many
years
this
ideally
successful
and
happy
pirate
utopia
flourished
but
at
length
misfortunes
came
one
on
top
of
the
other
and
a
sudden
and
unexpected
attack
by
the
hitherto
friendly
natives
finally
drove
misson
and
a
few
other
survivors
to
seek
safety
at
sea
but
overtaken
by
a
hurricane
their
vessel
foundered
and
misson
and
all
his
crew
were
drowned
and
thus
ended
the
era
of
what
may
be
called
piracy

found
they
had

than

they

took

after
reading
a
book
which
recorded
the
cruelty
of
the
spaniards
to
the
american
natives
and
this
story
inspired
him
with
such
a
hatred
of
all
spaniards
that
he
determined
to
go
to
the
west

throw
in
his
lot
with
the

and
to
devote
his
whole
life
and
energies
to
punishing

he
carried
out
his
resolve
most
thoroughly
and
treated
all

quite
a
young
man

went
to

but
afterwards
he
settled
at

which
was
his
home
for
the
rest
of
his

may
have
been
induced
to
go
to

have
possessed
great
power

winning
his
own
way
with
people
that
he
could
be
absolutely
unscrupulous
when
it
suited
his
ends
there
can
be
little

he
was
cruel
at
times

was
not
the
inhuman
monster
that
he
is
made
out
to
be
by
esquemeling
in
his
history
of
the
bucaniers
this
was
largely
proved
by
the
evidence
given
in
the
suit
for
libel
brought
and
won
by
morgan
against
the
publishers
although
morgan
was
if
possible
more
indignant
over
the
statement
in

book
that
he
had
been
kidnapped
in

most
of

no

to
jamaica
with
good
credentials
from

uncle
the

about

a
strong
garrison
there
to
cover
his
retreat

on
with
men
in
a
fleet
of
canoes
up
the
river
on
january
the
journey
across
the
isthmus
through
the
tropical
jungle
was
very
hard
on
the
men

as
they
had
depended
on
finding
provisions
to
supply
their
wants
on
the
way
and
carried
no
food
with
them
they
practically
starved
until
the
sixth
day
when
they

full
of

had
neglected
to
destroy

the
evening
of

ninth
day

that
touch
of
genius

so
often
brought
him
success
attacked
the
city
from
a
direction
the
spaniards
had
not
thought
possible
so
that
their
guns
were
all
placed
where
they
were
useless
and
they
were
compelled
to
do
just
what
the
buccaneer
leader
wanted
them
to
do
namely
to
come
out
of
their
fortifications
and
fight
him
in
the
open
the
battle
raged
fiercely
for
two
hours
between
the
brave
spanish
defenders
and
the
equally
brave
but
almost
exhausted
buccaneers
when
at
last
the
spaniards
turned
and
ran
the
buccaneers
were
too
tired
to
immediately
follow
up
their
success
but
after
resting
they
advanced
and
at
the
end
of
three
hours
street
fighting
the
city
was
theirs
the
first
thing
morgan
now
did
was
to
assemble
all
his
men
and
strictly
forbid
them
to
drink
any
wine
telling
them
that
he
had
secret
information
that
the
wine
had
been
poisoned
by
the
spaniards
before
they
left
the
city
this
was
of
course
a
scheme
of
morgan
to
stop
his
men
from
becoming
drunk
when
they
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
enemy
as
had
happened
in
many
a
previous
buccaneer
assault
morgan
now
set
about
plundering
the
city
a
large
part
of
which
was
burnt
to
the
ground
though
whether
this
was
done
by
his
orders
or
by
the
spanish
governor
has
never
been
decided
after
three
weeks
the
buccaneers
started
back
on
their
journey
to
san
lorenzo
with
a
troop
of
laden
with
gold
silver
and
goods
of
all
sorts
together
with
a
large
number
of
prisoners
the
rearguard
on
the
march
was
under
the
command
of
a
kinsman
of
the
admiral
colonel
bledry
morgan
on
their
arrival
at
chagres
the
spoils
were
divided
amidst
a
great
deal
of
quarrelling
and
in
march
morgan
sailed
off
to
port
royal
with
a
few
friends
and
the
greater
part
of
the
plunder
leaving
his
faithful
followers
behind
without
ships
or
provisions
and
with
but
apiece
as
their
share
of
the
spoils
on
may
the
council
of
jamaica
passed
a
vote
of
thanks
to
morgan
for
his
successful
expedition
and
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
in
july
a
year
before
a
treaty
had
been
concluded
at
madrid
between
spain
and
england
for
restraining
depredations
and
establishing
peace
in
the
new
world
in
april
morgan
was
carried
to
england
as
a
prisoner
in
the
frigate
but
he
was
too
popular
to
be
convicted
and
after
being
acquitted
was
appointed
deputy
governor
of
jamaica
and
in
november
he
was
knighted
and
returned
to
the
west
indies
in
banister
who
was
of
the
troops
in
jamaica
writing
to
lord
arlington
about
morgan
said
he
morgan
is
a
well
deserving
person
and
one
of
great
courage
and
conduct
who
may
with
his
pleasure
perform
good
public
service
at
home
or
be
very
advantageous
to
this
island
if
war
should
again
break
forth
with
the
spaniards
while
morgan
was
in
england
he
brought
an
action
for
libel
against
william
crooke
the
publisher
of
the
history
of
the
bucaniers
of
america
the
result
of
this
trial
was
that
crooke
paid
damages
to
morgan
and
published
a
long
and
grovelling
apology
morgan
was
essentially
a
man
of
action
and
a
regular
life
on
shore
proved
irksome
to
him
for
we
learn
from
a
report
sent
home
by
lord
vaughan
in
that
morgan
frequented
the
taverns
of
port
royal
drinking
and
gambling
in
unseemly
fashion
but
nevertheless
the
jamaican
assembly
had
voted
the
a
sum
of
special
salary
in
vaughan
brought
definite
charges
against
morgan
and
another
member
of
the
council
robert
byndloss
of
giving
aid
to
certain
jamaica
pirates
morgan
made
a
spirited
defence
and
no
doubt
largely
owing
to
his
popularity
got
off
and
in
was
granted
a
commission
to
be
a
captain
of
a
company
of
men
the
governor
to
succeed
vaughan
was
lord
carlisle
who
seems
to
have
liked
morgan
in
spite
of
his
jovial
goings
on
with
his
old
buccaneer
friends
in
the
taverns
of
port
royal
and
in
some
of
his
letters

of
morgan

are
made

him

to
the
french
island
of
dominica
in

having
served
his
time
went
to
the
island
of
hispaniola
and
joined
the
buccaneers
there
living
by
hunting
wild
cattle
and
drying
the
flesh
or
boucan
he
then
sailed
for
a
few
voyages
as
a
sailor
before
the
mast
and
acted
with
such
ability
and
courage
that
the
governor
of
tortuga
island
monsieur
de
la
place
gave
him
the
command
of
a
vessel
and
sent
him
out
to
seek
his
fortune
at
first
the
young
buccaneer
was
very
successful
and
he
took
many
spanish
ships
but
owing
to
his
ferocious
treatment
of
his
prisoners
he
soon
won
a
name
for
cruelty
which
has
never
been
surpassed
but
at
the
height
of
this
success
his
ship
was
wrecked
in
a
storm
and
although
most
of
the
pirates
got
ashore
they
were
at
once
attacked
by
a
party
of
spaniards
and
all
but
were
killed
the
captain
escaped
after
being
wounded
by
smearing
blood
and
sand
over
his
face
and
hiding
himself
amongst
his
dead
companions
disguised
as
a
spaniard
he
entered
the
city
of
campeachy
where
bonfires
and
other
manifestations
of
public
relief
were
being
held
to
express
the
joy
of
the
citizens
at
the
news
of
the
death
of
their
terror
meeting
with
some
french
slaves
the
fugitive
planned
with
them
to
escape
in
the
night
in
a
canoe
this
being
successfully
carried
out
they
eventually
arrived
back
at
tortuga
the
pirate
stronghold
here
the
enterprising
captain
stole
a
small
vessel
and
again
started
off
on
the
account
plundering
a
village
called
de
los
cagos
in
cuba
the
governor
of
havana
receiving
word
of
the
notorious
and
apparently
resurrected
pirate
arrival
sent
a
ship
to
take
him
adding
to
the
company
a
negro
executioner
with
orders
to
hang
all
the
pirate
crew
with
the
exception
of
who
was
to
be
brought
back
to
havana
alive
and
in
chains
instead
of
the
spaniards
taking
the
frenchman
the
opposite
happened
and
everyone
of
them
was
murdered
including
the
negro
hangman
with
the
exception
of
one
man
who
was
sent
with
a
written
message
to
the
governor
to
tell
him
that
in
future
would
kill
every
spaniard
he
met
with
joining
with
a
famous
filibuster
michael
de
basco
soon
organized
a
more
important
expedition
consisting
of
a
fleet
of
eight
vessels
and
men
sailing
to
the
gulf
of
venezuela
in
they
entered
the
lake
destroying
the
fort
that
stood
to
guard
the
entrance
thence
sailing
to
the
city
of
maracaibo
they
found
all
the
inhabitants
had
fled
in
terror
the
filibusters
caught
many
of
the
inhabitants
hiding
in
the
neighbouring
woods
and
killed
numbers
of
them
in
their
attempts
to
force
from
the
rest
the
of
their
treasure
they
next
marched
upon
and
attacked
the
town
of
gibraltar
which
was
valiantly
defended
by
the
spaniards
until
the
evening
when
having
lost
men
killed
they
surrendered
for
four
weeks
this
town
was
pillaged
the
inhabitants
murdered
while
torture
and
rape
were
daily
occurrences
at
last
to
the
relief
of
the
wretched
inhabitants
the
buccaneers
with
a
huge
booty
sailed
away
to
corso
island
a
place
of
rendezvous
of
the
french
buccaneers
here
they
divided
their
spoil
which
totalled
the
great
sum
of
pieces
of
eight
which
when
divided
amongst
them
gave
each
man
above
one
hundred
pieces
of
eight
as
well
as
his
share
of
plate
silk
and
jewels
also
a
share
was
allotted
for
the
of
each
man
killed
and
extra
rewards
for
those
pirates
who
had
lost
a
limb
or
an
eye
had
now
become
most
famous
amongst
the
brethren
of
the
coast
and
began
to
make
arrangements
for
an
even
more
daring
expedition
to
attack
and
plunder
the
coast
of
nicaragua
here
he
burnt
and
pillaged
ruthlessly
committing
the
most
revolting
cruelties
on
the
spanish
inhabitants
one
example
of
this
monster
inhuman
deeds
will
more
than
suffice
to
tell
of
it
happened
that
during
an
attack
on
the
town
of
san
pedros
the
buccaneers
had
been
caught
in
an
ambuscade
and
many
of
them
killed
although
the
spaniards
had
at
last
turned
and
fled
the
pirates
killed
most
of
their
prisoners
but
kept
a
few
to
be
questioned
by
so
as
to
find
some
other
way
to
the
town
as
he
could
get
no
information
out
of
these
men
the
frenchman
drew
his
cutlass
and
with
it
cut
open
the
breast
of
one
of
the
spaniards
and
pulling
out
his
still
beating
heart
he
began
to
bite
and
gnaw
it
with
his
teeth
like
a
ravenous
wolf
saying
to
the
other
prisoners
i
will
serve
you
all
alike
if
you
show
me
not
another
way
shortly
after
this
many
of
the
buccaneers
broke
away
from
and
sailed
under
the
command
of
moses
van
vin
the
second
in

in
his
big
ship

her

vegetables

also
wheat
for
which
they
baked
bread
in
portable
ovens
which
these
french
buccaneers
carried
about
with
them
it
took
them
six
months
to
build
their
and
when
it
was
finished
it
would
not
carry

than
half

number

were
drawn
to
settle
who
should

who
remain
behind

boat
towards

was
caught
by

described
by

here
suddenly
his
assailed
him
which
of
a
long
time
had
been
reserved
for
him
as
a
punishment
due
to
the
multitude
of
horrible
crimes
which
in
his
licentious
and
wicked
life
he
had
committed
for
god
almighty
the
time
of
his
divine
justice
being
now
already
come

appointed
the
indians
of

these
instruments
of

him
in

alive
throwing
his
body
limb
by

into
the
fire
and
his
ashes
into
the
air
to
the
intent
no
trace
nor
memory
might
remain
of
such
an
infamous
inhuman
creature

a

captain
north
was
a
man
of
remarkable
ability
and
in
his
later
calling
of
piracy
he
gained
great
notoriety
and
was
a
born
leader
of
men
his
history
has
been
written
fully
and
is
well
worth
reading
he
had
many
ups
and
downs
in
his
early
seafaring
life
in
the
west
indies
being
no
less
than
three
times
taken
by
the
pressgang
each
time
escaping
he
served
in
dutch
and
spanish
privateers
and
eventually
rose
to
being
a
pirate
captain
making
his
headquarters
in
madagascar
from
here
he
sailed
out
to
the
east
indies
and
preyed
on
the
ships
of
the
east
india
company
several
times
he
was
wrecked
once
he
was
the
only
survivor
and
swam
ashore
at
madagascar
stark
naked
the
unusual
sight
of
a
naked
englishman
spread
terror
amongst
the
natives
who
were
on
the
beach
and
they
all
fled
into
the
jungle
except
one
a
woman
who
from
previous
personal
experience
knew
that
this
was
but
a
human
being
and
not
a
sea
devil
she
supplied
him
with
clothes
of
a
sort
and
led
him
to
the
nearest
pirate
settlement
some
six
miles
away
on
another
occasion
when
the
pirates
were
having
a
jollification
ashore
having
left
their
moorish
prisoners
on
the
ship
at
anchor
north
gave
the
prisoners
a
hint
to
clear
off
in
the
night
with
the
ship
otherwise
they
would
all
be
made
slaves
this
friendly
hint
was
acted
upon
and
in
the
morning
both
ship
and
prisoners
had
vanished
the
pirates
having
lost
their
ship
took
to
the
peaceful
and
harmless
life
of
planters
with
north
as
their
ruler
he
won
the
confidence
of
the
natives
who
abided
by
his
decision
in
all
quarrels
and
misunderstandings
occasionally
north
and
his
men
would
join
forces
with
a
neighbouring
friendly
tribe
and
go
to
war
north
leading
the
combined
army
and
victory
always
resulted
the
call
of
piracy
was
too
strong
in
his
bones
to
resist
and
after
three
years
planting
he
was
back
to
sea

the
jolly
roger
once
more
on
one
occasion
he
seized
the
opportunity
when
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
mascarenhas
islands
to
go
ashore
and
visit
the
catholic
priest
and
confess
and
at
the
same
time
made
suitable
arrangements
for
his
children
to
be
educated
by
the
church
north
evidently
truly
repented
his
former
sins
for
he
returned
to
resume
his
simple
life
on
his
plantation
on
arriving
home
he
found
the
settlement
in
an
uproar
he
soon
settled
all
the
disputes
appeased
the
natives
and
before
long
had
this
of
pirates
back
in
its
previous
peaceful
and
happy
state

occasional
little
voyage

amongst

of

at

they
met
with

vessel
a

hunger
drove
them
to

even
so
big

the
sight
of

so
terrified
the

accomplished
and
bloody
pirate
butchering
his
prisoners
on
very
little
or
on
no

whatever

even
this
desperate
pirate
had
an
occasional
qualm
of
conscience
come
athwart
his
stomach
for
when
he
captured
a

was
about
to
scuttle

she
was

telling

have
done
him
enough
injury
already
ordered
the

to
be
repaired

so
as
a
punishment
the

was

to

fell
down

roberts
captain
bartholomew
welsh
pirate
born
died
if
a
pirate
is
to
be
reckoned
by
the
amount
of
damage
he
does
and
the
number
of
ships
he
takes
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
captain
roberts
should
be
placed
at
the
very
head
of
his
profession
for
he
is
said
to
have
taken
over
vessels
the
only
man
who
can
be
said
to
rival
him
is
sir
henry
morgan
but
morgan
although
in
some
ways
an
unmitigated
blackguard
was
a
man
of
much
greater
breadth
of
outlook
than
roberts
ever
was
and
moreover
was
a
buccaneer
rather
than
a
pirate
roberts
like
many
other
successful
pirates
was
born
in
wales
not
far
from
haverfordwest
he
is
described
as
being
a
tall
black
man
and
was
about
years
of
age
at
the
time
of
his
death
he
was
remarkable
even
among
his
remarkable
companions
for
several
things
first
of
all
he
only
drank
tea
thus
being
the
only
total
abstainer
known
to
the
fraternity
also
he
was
a
strict
disciplinarian
and
on
board
his
ships
all
lights
had
to
be
extinguished
by
any
of
the
crew
who
wished
to
continue
drinking
after
that
hour
had
to
do
so
on
the
open
deck
but
try
as
he
would
this
ardent
apostle
of
abstemiousness
was
unable
to
put
down
drinking
if
roberts
had
lived
no
doubt
he
would
have
been
on
the
council
of
the
local
vigilance
committee
he
would
allow
no
women
aboard
his
ships
in
fact
he
made
it
a
law
that
any
man
who
brought
a
woman
on
board
disguised
as
a
man
was
to
suffer
death
roberts
allowed
no
games
at
cards
or
dice
to
be
played
for
money
as
he
strongly
disapproved
of
gambling
he
was
a
strict
sabbatarian
and
allowed
the
musicians
to
have
a
rest
on
the
seventh
day
this
was
as
well
for
the
post
of
musician
on
a
pirate
ship
was
no
sinecure
as
every
pirate
had
the
right
to
demand
a
tune
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
he
used
to
place
a
guard
to
protect
all
his
women
prisoners
and
it
is
sadly
suspicious
that
there
was
always
the
greatest
competition
amongst
the
worst
characters
in
the
ship
to
be
appointed
sentinel
over
a
woman
prisoner
all
quarrels
had
to
be
settled
on
shore
pirate
fashion
the
duellists
standing
back
to
back
armed
with
pistol
and
cutlass
roberts
would
have
no
fighting
among
the
crew
on
board
his
ship
bartholomew
must
have
looked
the
very
part
of
a
pirate
when
dressed
for
action
a
tall
dark
man
he
used
to
wear
a
rich
damask
waistcoat
and
breeches
a
red
feather
in
his
cap
a
gold
chain
round
his
neck
with
a
large
diamond
cross
dangling
from
it
a
sword
in
his
hand
and
two
pairs
of
pistols
hanging
at
the
end
of
a
silk
sling
flung
over
his
shoulders
we
first
hear
of
roberts
as
sailing
in
honest
employ
as
master
of
the
captain
plumb
from
london
in
november
bound
for
the
coast
of
guinea
to
pick
up
a
cargo
of
black
ivory
at
anamaboe
here
his
ship
was
taken
by
the
welsh
pirate
howel
davis
at
first
roberts
was
disinclined
for
the
pirate
life
but
soon
changed
his
mind
on
the
death
of
davis
there
were
several
candidates
for
the
post
of
commander
all
brisk
and
lively
men
distinguished
by
the
title
of
lords
such
as
sympson
ashplant
anstis
and
others
one
of
these
lords
dennis
concluded
an
eloquent
harangue
over
a
bowl
of
punch
with
a
strong
appeal
for
roberts
to
be
the
new
chief
this
proposal
was
acclaimed
with
but
one
dissenting
voice
that
of
lord
sympson
who
had
hopes
of
being
elected
himself
and
who
sullenly
left
the
meeting
swearing
he
did
not
care
who
they
chose
captain
so
it
was
not
a
papist
so
roberts
was
elected
after
being
a
pirate
only
six
weeks
thus
was
true
merit
quickly
appreciated
and
rewarded
amongst
them
illustration
captain
bartholomew
roberts
to
face
p
roberts
speech
to
his
was
short
but
to
the
point
saying
that
since
he
had
dipped
his
hands
in
muddy
water
and
must
be
a
pyrate
it
was
better
being
a
commander
than
a
common
man
not
perhaps
a
graceful
nor
grateful
way
of
expressing
his
thanks
but
one
which
was
no
doubt
understood
by
his
audience
roberts
began
his
career
in
a
bright
manner
for
to
revenge
the
perfectly
justifiable
death
of
their
late
captain
he
seized
and
razed
the
fort
bombarded
the
town
and
setting
on
fire
two
portuguese
ships
so
as
to
act
as
torches
sailed
away
the
same
night
sailing
to
brazil
they
found
in
the
bay
of
bahia
a
fleet
of
portuguese
ships
ready
laden
and
on
the
point
of
leaving
for
lisbon
and
roberts
with
the
most
astounding
boldness
sailed
right
in
amongst
them
until
he
found
the
deepest
laden
which
he
attacked
and
boarded
although
his
was
a
much
smaller
ship
he
sailed
away
with
his
prize
from
the
harbour
this
prize
amongst
the
merchandise
contained
moidors
and
a
cross
of
diamonds
designed
for
the
king
of
portugal
he
then
took
a
dutch
ship
and
two
days
later
an
english
one
and
sailed
back
to
brazil
refitting
and
cleaning
at
the
island
of
ferdinando
in
a
work
such
as
this
is
it
is
impossible
to
recount
all
or
even
a
few
of
the
daring
adventures
or
the
piratical
ups
and
downs
of
one
pirate
roberts
sailed
to
the
west
indies
devastating
the
commerce
of
jamaica
and
barbadoes
when
things
grew
too
hot
there
he
went
north
to
newfoundland
and
played
the
very
devil
with
the
english
and
french
fishing
fleets
and
settlements
his
first
ship
he
called
the
his
next
a
bigger
ship
the
another
the
on
two
occasions
roberts
had
been
very
roughly
handled
once
by
a
ship
from
barbadoes
and
once
by
the
inhabitants
of
martinica
so
when
he
designed
his
new
flag
he
portrayed
on
it
a
huge
figure
of
himself
standing
sword
in
hand
upon
two
skulls
and
under
these
were
the
letters
and
signifying
a
barbadian
and
a
martinican
head
in
april
roberts
was
back
again
on
the
guinea
coast
burning
and
plundering
amongst
the
prisoners
he
took
out
of
one
of
his
prizes
was
a
clergyman
the
captain
dearly
wished
to
have
a
chaplain
on
board
his
ship
to
administer
to
the
spiritual
welfare
of
his
crew
and
tried
all
he
could
to
persuade
the
parson
to
sign
on
promising
him
that
his
only
duties
should
be
to
say
prayers
and
make
punch
but
the
prelate
begged
to
be
excused
and
was
at
length
allowed
to
go
with
all
his
belongings
except
three
and
a
corkscrew
articles
which
were
sorely
needed
aboard
the
the
end
of
roberts
career
was
now
in
sight
a
king
ship
the
captain
chaloner
ogle
discovered
roberts
ships
at
parrot
island
and
pretending
to
fly
from
them
was
followed
out
to
sea
by
one
of
the
pirates
a
fight
took
place
and
after
two
hours
the
pirates
struck
flinging
overboard
their
black
flag
that
it
might
not
rise
in
judgement
over
them
the
returned
in
a
few
days
to
parrot
island
to
look
for
roberts
in
the
roberts
being
at
breakfast
enjoying
a
savoury
dish
of
solomongundy
was
informed
of
the
approach
of
the
ship
but
refused
to
take
any
notice
of
it
at
last
thoroughly
alarmed
he
cut
his
cables
and
sailed
out
but
most
of
his
crew
being
drunk
even
at
this
early
hour
the
pirates
did
not
make
as
good
a
resistance
as
if
they
had
been
sober
early
in
the
engagement
roberts
was
hit
in
the
throat
by
a
and
killed
this

as
the
life
of
this
famous

is
very
justly
treated
fully
in
the
dictionary
of
national
biography
it
is
unnecessary
to
mention
more
than
a
few
incidents
in
his
adventurous
career
woodes
rogers
was
not
only
a
good
navigator
for
on
many
occasions
he
showed
a
remarkable
gift
for
commanding
mutinous
crews
in
spite
of
having
many
officers
on
whom
he
could
place
little
reliance
on
leaving
cork
in
after
an
incompetent
pilot
had
almost
run
his
ship
on
two
rocks
off
kinsale
called
the
sovereigne
bollacks

describes
his
crew
thus
a
third
were
foreigners
while
of
her
majestie
subjects
many
were
taylors
tinkers
pedlars
fiddlers
and
with
ten
boys
and
one
negro
it
was
with
crews
such
as
these
that
many
of
the
boldest
and
most
remarkable
early
voyages
were
made
and
they
required
a
man
of
woodes
rogers
stamp
to
knock
them
into
sailors
rogers
had
a
gift
for
inspiring
friendship
wherever
he
went
on
arriving
at
the
coast
of
brazil
his
boat
was
fired
on
when
trying
to
land
at
angre
de
reys
this
settlement
had
but
lately
received
several
hostile
visitors
in
the
way
of
french
pirates
but
before
a
week
was
passed
woodes
rogers
had
so
won
the
hearts
of
the
portuguese
governor
and
the
settlers
that
he
and
his
musick
were
invited
to
take
part
in
an
important
religious
function
or
entertainment
as
rogers
calls
it
where
he
says
we
waited
on
the
governour
signior
raphael
de
silva
lagos
in
a
body
being
ten
of
us
with
two
trumpets
and
a
hautboy
which
he
desir
might
play
us
to
church
where
our
musick
did
the
office
of
an
organ
but
separate
from
the
singing
which
was
by
the
fathers
well
perform
our
musick
played
boys
up
go
we
and
all
manner
of
noisy
paltry
tunes
and
after
service
our
musicians
who
were
by
that
time
more
than
half
drunk
march
at
the
head
of
the
company
next
to
them
an
old
father
and
two
fryars
carrying
lamps
of
incense
then
an
image
dressed
with
flowers
and
wax
candles
then
about
forty
priests
fryars
followed
by
the
governor
of
the
town
myself
and
capt
courtney
with
each
of
us
a
long
wax
candle
lighted
the
ceremony
held
about
two
hours
after
which
we
were
splendidly
entertained
by
the
fathers
of
the
convent
and
then
by
the
governour
they
unanimously
told
us
they
expected
nothing
from
us
but
our
company
and
they
had
no
more
but
our
musick
what
a
delightful
picture
this
calls
to
the
mind
the
little
brazilian
town
the
tropical
foliage
the
holy
procession
wax
figure
and
priests
followed
by
the
governor
with
an
english
buccaneer
on
either
side
and
headed
by
a
crew
of
drunken
protestant
english
sailors
playing
hey
boys
up
go
we
rogers
not
to
be
outdone
in
hospitality
next
day
entertained
the
governor
and
fathers
on
board
the
when
he
says
they
were
very
merry
and
in
their
cups
propos
the
pope
health
to
us
but
we
were
quits
with
by
toasting
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
to
keep
up
the
humour
we
also
proposed
william
pen
health
and
they
liked
the
liquor
so
well
that
they
refused
neither
alas
the
good
governor
and
the
fathers
were
not
in
a
fit
state
to
leave
the
ship
when
the
end
came
to
the
entertainment
so
slept
on
board
being
put
ashore
in
the
morning
when
we
saluted
with
a
huzza
from
each
ship
because
as
rogers
says
we
were
not
overstocked
with
powder
it
was
in
march
that
rogers
brought
his
little
fleet
into
the
harbour
of
guam
one
of
the
ladrone
islands
although
at
war
with
spain
the
captain
soon
became
on
his
usual
friendly
terms
with
the
governor
of
this
spanish
colony
and
gave
an
entertainment
on
board
his
ship
to
him
and
four
other
spanish
gentlemen
making
them
as
welcome
as
time
and
place
would
afford
with
musick
and
our
sailors
dancing
the
governor
gave
a
return
party
on
shore
to
which
rogers
and
all
his
brother
officers
were
invited
partaking
of
sixty
dishes
of
various
sorts
after
this
feast
rogers
gave
his
host
a
present
consisting
of
two
negro
boys
dress
in
liveries
one
other
instance
of
woodes
rogers
adaptability
must
suffice
in
the
year
he
was
appointed
governor
to
the
bahama
islands
at
new
providence
now
called
nassau
his
chief
duty
was
to
stamp
out
the
west
india
pirates
who
had
made
this
island
their
headquarters
for
many
years
and
were
in
complete
power
there
and
numbered
more
than
desperadoes
including
such
famous
men
as
vane
and
teach
rogers
only
weapon
besides
the
he
arrived
in
was
a
royal
proclamation
from
king
george
offering
free
pardon
to
all
pirates
or
buccaneers
who
would
surrender
at
once
to
the
new
governor
at
first
the
pirates
were
inclined
to
resist
his
landing
but
in
the
end
the
tactful
rogers
got
his
own
way
and
not
only
landed
but
was
received
by
an
armed
guard
of
honour
and
passed
between
two
lines
of
pirates
who
fired
salutes
with
their
muskets
most
of
the
pirates
surrendered
and
received
their
pardons
but
some
who
reverted
shortly
afterwards
to
piracy
and
were
captured
and
brought
back
to
new
providence
were
tried
and
actually
hanged

sawkins
captain
richard
buccaneer
we
know
little
of
the
early
career
of
this
remarkable
buccaneer
he
was
loved
by
his
crew
and
had
great
influence
over
them
it
is
recorded
that
one
sunday
morning
finding
some
of
his
men
gambling
he
threw
the
dice
overboard
saying
he
would
have
no
gambling
aboard
his
ship
we
know
that
on
one
occasion
he
was
caught
in
his
vessel
by
and
brought
to
port
royal
jamaica
and
that
on
december
he
was
in
prison
awaiting
trial
for
piracy
apparently
he
got
off
for
this
brilliant
young
buccaneer
is
soon
afterwards
heard
of
as
commanding
a
small
vessel
of
sixteen
tons
armed
with
but
one
gun
and
a
crew
of
men
he
was
one
of
a
party
of
buccaneers
who
under
the
leadership
of
coxon
and
sharp
landed
on
the
coast
of
darien
and
marched
through
the
jungle
to
attack
and
plunder
the
town
of
santa
maria
the
remainder
of
the
journey
across
the
isthmus
was
done
in
canoes
in
which
the
pirates
travelled
down
the
santa
maria
river
until
they
found
themselves
in
the
pacific
on
this
expedition
each
captain
had
his
company
and
had
his
own
colours
sawkins
flag
being
a
red
one
with
yellow
stripes
arrived
at
the
sea
they
captured
two
small
spanish
vessels
and
the
rest
of
the
company
being
in
the
canoes
they
boldly
sailed
towards
panama
city
meeting
with
the
spanish
fleet
of
eight
ships
the
buccaneers
attacked
it
and
after
a
most
furious
battle
came
off
victorious
this
was
one
of
the
most
gallant
episodes
in
the
whole
history
of
the
brethren
of
the
coast
and
was
afterwards
known
as
the
battle
of
perico
sawkins
fought
in
the
most
brave
and
desperate
manner
and
took
a
large
share
in
the
successful
enterprise
after
this
action
some
quarrelling
took
place
which
ended
by
captain
coxon
going
off
with
some
seventy
men
to
return
across
the
isthmus
on
foot
the
company
that
remained
in
the
pacific
elected
sawkins
to
be
their
leader
as
captain
sharp
a
much
older
man
was
away
in
his
ship
the
buccaneers
ever
since
they
defeated
the
spanish
fleet
had
blockaded
the
harbour
and
a
correspondence
took
place
between
the
governor
of
panama
and
sawkins
the
former
wishing
to
know
what
the
pirates
had
come
there
for
to
this
message
sawkins
sent
back
answer
that
we
came
to
assist
the
king
of
darien
who
was
the
true
lord
of
panama
and
all
the
country
thereabouts
and
that
since
we
were
come
so
far
there
was
no
reason
but
that
we
should
have
some
satisfaction
so
that
if
he
pleased
to
send
us
five
hundred
pieces
of
eight
for
each
man
and
one
thousand
for
each
commander
and
not
any
farther
to
annoy
the
indians
but
suffer
them
to
use
their
own
power
and
liberty
as
became
the
true
and
natural
lords
of
the
country
that
then
we
would
desist
from
all
further
hostilities
and
go
away
peaceably
otherwise
that
we
should
stay
there
and
get
what
we
could
causing
to
them
what
damage
was
possible
this
message
was
just
bluff
on
sawkins
part
but
having
heard
that
the
bishop
of
santa
martha
was
in
the
city
sawkins
sent
him
two
loaves
of
sugar
as
a
present
and
reminded
the
prelate
that
he
had
been
his
prisoner
five
years
before
when
sawkins
took
that
town
further
messengers
returned
from
panama
next
day
bringing
a
gold
ring
for
sawkins
from

he
inquired
from
whom
we

to

he

to
complain
for
the
damage
we
had
already
done

sent
back
answer
that
as
yet
all
his
company
were
not
come
together
but
that
when
they
were
come
up
we
would
come
and
visit
him
at
panama
and
bring
our
commissions
on
the
muzzles
of
our
guns
at
which
time
he
should
read
them
as
plain
as
the
flame
of
gunpowder
could
make
them
after
lying
off
panama
for
some
while
without
meeting
with
any
plunder
and
their
victuals
running
short
the
crews
began
to
grumble
and
persuaded
sawkins
to
sail
south
along
the
coast
this
he
did
and
arriving
off
the
town
of
puebla
nueva
on
may
sawkins
landed
a
party
of
sixty
men
and
led
them
against
the
town
but
the
spaniards
had
been
warned
in
time
and
had
built
up
three
strong
breastworks
sawkins
who
never
knew
what
fear
meant
stormed
the
town
at
the
head
of
his
men
but
was
killed
by
a
basil
ringrose
the
buccaneer
who
wrote
the
narrative
of
this
voyage
describes
sawkins
as
being
a
man
who
was
as
valiant
and
courageous
as
any
man
could
be
and
the
best
beloved
of
all
our
company

on

he
speaks

of

describing

conduct
on

says
he
appeared
very
penitent

his

diligent

surgeon
in

and
taken
by

in
it
was
a
rule
on

vessels
for
the
surgeon
to
be
excused
from
signing
the

articles
when
the
next
prize
was
taken
if
she
carried
a

he
was
taken

if
the
latter
wished
to
leave
but
when
scudamore
came
on
board
the
he
insisted
on
signing
the
pirate
articles
and
boasted
that
he
was
the
first
surgeon
that
had
ever
done
so
and
he
hoped
he
said
to
prove
as
great
a
rogue
as
any
of
them
when
the
african
company
guinea
ship
the
was
taken
scudamore
came
aboard
and
helped
himself
to
their
surgeon
instruments
and
medicines
he
also
took
a
fancy
for
a
backgammon
board
but
only
kept
it
after
a
violent
quarrel
with
another

it
came
out
at
his
trial
that
on
a
voyage
from
the
island
of
thomas
in
a
prize
the
in
which
was
a
cargo
of

scudamore
had
tried
to
bring
about
a
mutiny
of
the
blacks
to
kill
the
prize
crew
which
was
on
board
and
he
was
detected
in
the
night
going
about
amongst
the
negroes
talking
to
them
in
the
angolan
language
he
said
that
he
knew
enough
about
navigation
to
sail
the
ship
himself
and
he
was
heard
to
say
that
this
were
better
than
to
be
taken
to
cape
corso
to
be
hanged
and
sun
dried
the

witness
told
how
he
had
approached
the

to
persuade
a
wounded
pirate
one
james
harris
to
join
him
in
his
scheme
but
fearing
to
be
overheard
scudamore
turned
the
conversation
to
scudamore
was
condemned
to
death
but
allowed
three
days
grace
before
being
hanged
which
he
spent
in
incessant
prayers
and
reading
of
the
scriptures
on
the
gallows
he
sang

the
psalm
died
at
the
age
of
searles
captain
robert
in
he
brought
in
two
spanish
prizes
to
port
royal
but
as
orders
had
only
lately
come
from
england
to
the
governor
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
promote
friendly
relations
with
the
spanish
islands
these
prizes
were
returned
to
their
owners
to
prevent
searle
doing
such
things
again
he
was
deprived
of
his
ship
rudder
and
sails
in

in
company
with
a

selkirk
alexander
the
original
robinson
crusoe
born
in
at
largo
in
fifeshire
he
was
the
seventh
son
of
john
selcraig
a
shoemaker
in
he
was
cited
to
appear
before
the
session
for
indecent
conduct
in
church
but
ran
away
to
sea
in
he
was
back
again
in
largo
and
was
rebuked
in
the
face
of
the
congregation
for
quarrelling
with
his
brothers
a
year
later
selkirk
sailed
to
england
and
in
joined
dampier
expedition
to
the
south
seas
appointed
to
the
commanded
by
captain
stradling
in
september
he
arrived
at
the
uninhabited
island
of
juan
fernandez
in
the
south
pacific
selkirk
having
quarrelled
with
the
captain
insisted
on
being
landed
on
the
island
with
all
his
belongings
he
lived
alone
here
for
nearly
four
years
building
himself
two
cabins
hunting
the
goats
which
abounded
and
taming
young
goats
and
cats
to
be
his
companions
on
the
night
of
january
seeing
two
ships
selkirk
lit
a
fire
and
a
boat
was
sent
ashore
these
ships
were
the
and
of
bristol
under
the
command
of
captain
woodes
rogers
while
his
old
friend
dampier
was
acting
as
pilot
selkirk
was
at
once
appointed
of
the
and
eventually
arrived
back
in
the
thames
on
october
with
booty
worth
having
been
away
from
england
for
eight
years
while
in
england
he
met
steele
who
described
selkirk
as
a
man
of
good
sense
with
strong
but
cheerful
expression
whether
selkirk
ever
met
defoe
is
uncertain
though
the
character
of
robinson
crusoe
was
certainly
founded
on
his
adventures
in
juan
fernandez
in
he
returned
to
largo
living
the
life
of
a
recluse
and
we
must
be
forgiven
for
suspecting
that
he
rather
acted
up
to
the
part
since
it
is
recorded
that
he
made
a
cave
in
his
father
garden
in
which
to
meditate
this
life
of
meditation
in
an
artificial
cave
was
soon
rudely
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
a
certain
miss
sophia
bonce
with
whom
selkirk
fell
violently
in
love
and
they
eloped
together
to
bristol
which
must
have
proved
indeed
a
sad
scandal
to
the
elders
and
other
godly
citizens
of
largo
beyond
the
fact
that
he
was
charged
at
bristol
with
assaulting
one
richard
nettle
a
shipwright
we
hear
no
more
of
selkirk
until
his
first
will
was
drawn
up
in
in
which
he
leaves
his
fortune
and
house
to
my
loving
friend
sophia
bonce
of
the
pall

london
spinster
shortly
after
this
alexander
basely
deserted
his
loving

in

rejoined

spriggs
captain
francis
farrington
an
uninteresting
and
bloody
pirate
without
one
single
redeeming
character
he
learnt
his
art
with
the
pirate
captain
lowther
afterwards
serving
as
quartermaster
with
captain
low

taking
an
active
part
in
all
the
barbarities
committed
by

latter
about

took
a
prize
a
called

he
handed
over
to
some
of
the
crew
who
elected
spriggs
their
captain
the
ship
they
renamed
the
and
in
the
night
altered
their
course
and
left
low
they
made
a
flag
bearing
upon
it
a
white
skeleton
holding
in
one
hand
a
dart
striking
a
bleeding
heart
and
in
the
other
an
hourglass
sailing
to
the
west
indies
spriggs
took
several
prizes
treating
the
crews
with
abominable
cruelty
on
one
occasion
the
pirates
chased
what
they
believed
to
be
a
spanish
ship
and
after
a
long
while
they
came
alongside
and
fired
a
broadside
into
her
the
ship
immediately
surrendered
and
turned
out
to
be
a
vessel
the
pirate
had
plundered
only
a
few
days
previously
this
infuriated
spriggs
and
his
crew
who
showed
their
disappointment
by
half
murdering
the
captain
after
a
narrow
escape
from
being
captured
by
a
french
near
the
island
of

sailed
north
to
the
summer
isles
or
bermudas
taking
a
ship
coming
from
rhode
island
they
found
her
cargo
to
consist
of
horses
several
of
the
pirates
mounted
these
and
galloped
up
and
down
the
deck
until
they
were
thrown
while
plundering
several
small
vessels
of
their
cargo
of
logwood
in
the
bay
of
honduras
spriggs
was
surprised
and
attacked
by
an
english
and
the
pirates
only
escaped
by
using
their
sweeps
spriggs
now
went
for
a
cruise
off
the
coast
of
south
carolina
returning
again
to
honduras
this
was
a
rash
proceeding
on
spriggs
part
for
as
he
was
sailing
off
the
west
end
of
cuba
he
again
met
the
which
had
so
nearly
caught
him
before
in

bay

clapped
on
all
sail
but
ran
his

dejected
except
sympson

spoke

this
was

imputed

taylor
captain
this
formidable
south
sea
pirate
must
indeed
have
looked
as
well
as
acted
the
part
since
his
appearance
is
described
by
captain
johnson
as
follows
a
fellow
with
a
terrible
pair
of
whiskers
and
a
wooden
leg
being
stuck
round
with

like

himself
in

he
was
a

of

the

even
better
four
million
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
taylor
now
sailing
in

heard
that
there
were
four
on
his
tracks
so
he
sailed
to
delagoa
bay
and
spent
the
winter
of
the
year
there
it
was
now
decided
that
as
they
had
a
huge
amount
of
plunder
they
had
better
give
up
piracy
so
they
sailed
away
to
the
west
indies
and
surrendered
themselves
to
the
governor
of

broke
up
and

with

over

by
the
whole

and
these
learned
men
were
unanimous
in
agreeing
that
the
leg
should
be
amputated
some
dispute
then
arose
as
to
who
should
act
the
part
of
surgeon
and
at
length
the
carpenter
was
chosen
as
the
most
proper
person
upon
which
he
fetch
up
the
biggest
saw
and
taking
the
limb
under
his
arm
fell
to
work

separated
it
from
the
body
of
the

little
time
as

cauteriz
the

to

armed
with
forty
guns

blackbeard
went
aboard

a
ship
that
allowed
him
to
go
for
larger
prizes
and
he
began
by
taking

he
plundered

days
later

bonnet
became
friends
and
sailed
together
for
a

days
when

finding
that
bonnet
was
quite
ignorant
of
maritime
matters
ordered
the
major
in
the
most
way
to
come
aboard
his
ship
while
he
put
another
officer
in

now
took
ship
after
ship
one
of
which
with
the
curious
name
of
the
the
pirates
burnt
out
of
spite
not
because
of
her
name
but
because
she
belonged
to
boston
where
there
had
lately
been
a
hanging
of
pirates
blackbeard
now
sailed
north
along
the
american
coast
arriving
off
charleston
south
carolina
here
he
lay
off
the
bar
for
several
days
seizing
every
vessel
that
attempted
to
enter
or
leave
the
port
striking
great
terror
to
the
whole
province
of

the
more
so
since
the
colony
was
scarcely
recovered
from
a
recent
visit
by
another
pirate
vane
being
in
want
of
medicines
teach
sent
his
lieutenant
richards
on
shore
with
a
letter
to
the
governor
demanding
that
he
should
instantly
send
off
a
medicine
chest
or
else
teach
would
murder
all
his
prisoners

to
send

to

house
many
of
these
prisoners
being
the
chief
persons
of
the
colony
teach
who
was
unprincipled
even
for
a
pirate
now
commanded
three
vessels
and
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
his
crews
and
keep
all
the
booty
for
himself
and
a
few
chosen
friends
to
do
this
he
contrived
to
wreck
his
own
vessel
and
one
of
his
sloops
then
with
his
friends
and
all
the
booty
he
sailed
off
leaving
the
rest
marooned
on
a
small
sandy
island
teach
next
sailed
to
north
carolina
and
with
the
greatest
coolness
surrendered
with
twenty
of
his
men
to
the
governor
charles
eden
and
received

royal
pardon

spent
the
next
few
weeks
in
cultivating
an
intimate
friendship
with
the
governor
who
no
doubt
shared
teach
booty
with
him
a
romantic
episode
took
place
at
this
time
at
bath
town
the
pirate
fell
in
love
not
by
any
means
for
the
first
time
with
a
young
lady
of
years
of
age
to
show
his
delight
at
this
charming
union
the
governor
himself
married
the
happy
pair
this
being
the
captain
fourteenth
wife
though
certain
bath
town
gossips
were
heard
to
say
that
there
were
no
fewer
than
twelve
mrs
teach
still
alive
at
different
ports
up
and
down
the
west
india
islands
in
june
the
bridegroom
felt
that
the
call
of
duty
must
be
obeyed
so
kissing
to
the
new
mrs
teach
he
sailed
away
to
the
bermudas
meeting
on
his
way
half
a
dozen
ships
which
he
plundered
and
then
hurried
back
to
share
the
spoils
with
the
governor
of
north
carolina
and
his
secretary
knight
for
several
months
blackbeard
remained
in
the
river
exacting
a
toll
from
all
the
shipping
often
going
ashore
to
make
merry
at
the
expense
of
the
planters
at
length
things
became
so
unbearable
that
the
citizens
and
planters
sent
a
request
to
the
governor
of
the
neighbouring
colony
of
virginia
for
help
to
rid
them
of
the
presence
of
teach
the
governor
spotswood
an
energetic
man
at
once
made
plans
for
taking
the
pirate
and
commissioned
a
gallant
young
naval
officer
lieutenant
robert
maynard
of
to
go
in
a
sloop
the
in
search
of
him
on
november
the
lieutenant
sailed
for
kicquetan
in
the
james
river
and
on
the
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
okerecock
inlet
where
he
discovered
the
pirate
he
was
in
search
of
blackbeard
would
have
been
caught
unprepared
had
not
his
friend
secretary
knight
hearing
what
was
on
foot
sent
a
letter
warning
him
to
be
on
his
guard
and
also
any
of
teach
crew
whom
he
could
find
in
the
taverns
of
bath
town
maynard
lost
no
time
in
attacking
the
pirate
ship
which
had
run
aground
the
fight
was
furious
teach
boarding
the
sloop
and
a
terrific
struggle
taking
place
the
lieutenant
and
teach
fighting
with
swords
and
pistols
teach
was
wounded
in
places
before
he
fell
dead
while
the
lieutenant
escaped
with
nothing
worse
than
a
cut
over
the
fingers
maynard
now
returned
in
triumph
in
his
sloop
to
bath
town
with
the
head
of
blackbeard
hung
up
to
the
end
and
received
a
tremendous
ovation
from
the
inhabitants
during
his
meteoric
career
as
a
pirate
the
name
of
blackbeard
was
one
that
created
terror
up
and
down
the
coast
of
america
from
newfoundland
to
trinidad
this
was
not
only
due
to
the
number
of
ships
teach
took
but
in
no
small
measure
to
his
alarming
appearance
teach
was
a
tall
powerful
man
with
a
fierce
expression
which
was
increased
by
a
long
black
beard
which
grew
from
below
his
eyes
and
hung
down
to
a
great
length
this
he
plaited
into
many
tails
each

tied

ribbon

turned
back
over
his

when
going

teach
wore
a
sling
on
his
shoulders
with
three
pairs
of
pistols
and
struck
lighted
matches
under
the
brim
of
his
hat
these
so
added
to
his
fearful
appearance
as
to
strike
terror
into
all
beholders
teach
had
a
peculiar
sense
of
humour
and
one
that
could
at
times
cause
much
uneasiness
amongst
his
friends
thus
we
are
told
that
one
day
on
the
deck
of
his
ship
being
at
the
time
a
little
flushed
with
wine
blackbeard
addressed
his
crew
saying
come
let
us
make
a
hell
of
our
own
and
try
how
long
we
can
bear
it
whereupon
teach
with
several
others
descended
to
the
hold
shut
themselves
in
and
then
set
fire
to
several
pots
of
brimstone
for
a
while
they
stood
it
choking
and
gasping
but
at
length
had
to
escape
to
save
themselves
from
being
asphyxiated
but
the
last
to
give
up
was
the
captain
who
was
wont
to
boast
afterwards
that
he
had
outlasted
all
the
rest
then
there
was
that
little
affair
in
the
cabin
when
teach
blew
out
the
candle
and
in
the
dark
fired
his
pistols
under
the
table
severely
wounding
one
of
his
guests
in
the
knee
for
no
other
reason
as
he
explained
to
them
afterwards
than
if
he
did
not
shoot
one
or
two
of
them
now
and
then
they
forget
who
he
was
teach
kept
a
log
or
journal
which
unfortunately
is
lost
but
the
entries
for
two
days
have
been
preserved
and
are
worth
giving
and
seem
to
smack
of
robert

in

the

written

run

turned
pirates
and
sailed
to
the
red
sea
here
he
met
with
a
great
indian
ship
which
he
had
the
hardiness
to
attack
and
soon
took
her
and
each
of
his
men
received
as
his
share
and
with
this
booty
they
sailed
to
madagascar
he
was
already
held
in
high
esteem
by
the
pirates
who
resided
in
that
favourite
stronghold
at
one
time
he
joined
misson
the
originator
of
at
his
garden
city
of
libertatia
a
quarrel
arose
between
misson
french
followers
and
tew
english
pirates
a
duel
was
arranged
between
the
two
leaders
but
by
the
tact
of
another
pirate
an
unfrocked
italian
priest
all
was
settled
amicably
tew
being
appointed
admiral
and
the
diplomatic
suitably
chosen
as
secretary
of
state
to
the
little
republic
such
a
reputation
for
kindness
had
tew
that
ships
seldom
resisted
him
but
on
knowing
who
their
assailant
was
they
gave
themselves
up
freely
some
of
tew
men
started
a
daughter
colony
on
their
own
account
and
the
admiral
sailed
after
them
to
try
and
persuade
them
to
return
to
the
fold
at
libertatia
the
men
refused
and
while
tew
was
arguing
and
trying
to
persuade
them
to
change
their
minds
his
ship
was
lost
in
a
sudden
storm
tew
was
soon
rescued
by
the
ship
with
misson
on
board
who
with
a
few
men
had
escaped
being
massacred
by
the
natives
misson
giving
tew
an
equal
share
of
his
gold
and
diamonds
sailed
away
while
tew
managed
to
return
to
rhode
island
in
new
england
where
he
settled
down
for
a
while
to
show
the
honesty
of
this
man
being
now
affluent
he
kept
a
promise
to
the
friends
in
bermuda
who
originally
set
him
up
with
a
ship
by
sending
them
fourteen
times
the
original
cost
of
the
sloop
as
their
just
share
of
the
profits
at
last
tew
found
the
call
of
the
sea
and
the
lure
of
the
grand
account
too
great
to
resist
and
he
consented
to
take
command
of
a
pirate
ship
which
was
to
go
on
a
cruise
in
the
red
sea
arrived
there
tew
attacked
a
big
ship
belonging
to
the
great

during
the
battle
was
mortally
wounded
his
historian
tells
us
a
shot
carried
away
the
rim
of
tew
belly
who
held
his
bowels
with
his
hands
for
some
space
when
he
dropped
it
struck
such
terror
to
his
men
that
they
suffered
themselves
to
be
taken
without
further
resistance
thus
fell

with
his
great
guns
loaded
with
shot
this
compliment
of
one
pirate
chief
to
another
was
returned
in
like
kind
and
then
mutual
civilities
followed
for
several
days
between
the
two
pirate
captains
and
their
crews
these
civilities
taking
the
form
of
a
glorious
debauch
in
a
quiet
creek
on
the
coast
vane
soon
had
a
change
of
fortune
when
meeting
with
a
french
he
decided
to
decline
an
engagement
and
to
seek
safety
in
flight
greatly
to
the
anger
of
his
crew
for
this
he
was
obliged
to
stand
the
test
of
the
vote
of
the
whole
crew
who
passed
a
resolution
against
his
honour
and
dignity
and
branded
him
a
coward
deprived
him
of
his
command
and
packed
him
off
with
a
few
of
his
adherents
in
a
small
sloop
vane
not
discouraged
by
this
reverse
of
fortune
rose
again
from
the
bottom
rung
of
the
ladder
to
success
and
quickly
increased
in
strength
of
ships
and
crew
until
one
day
being
overcome
by
a
sudden
tornado
he
lost
everything
but
his
life
being
washed
up
on
a
small
uninhabited
island
off
the
honduras
coast
here
he
managed
to
support
life
by
begging
food
from
the
fishermen
who
occasionally
came
there
in
their
canoes
at
last
a
ship
put
in
for
water
commanded
by
one
captain
holford
who
happened
to
be
an
old
friend
of
vane
vane
naturally
was
pleased
at
this
piece
of
good
fortune
and
asked
his
dear
old
friend
to
take
him
off
the
island
in
his
ship
to
which
holford
replied
charles
i
sha
trust
you
aboard
my
ship
unless
i
carry
you
as
a
prisoner
for
i
shall
have
you
caballing
with
my
men
knock
me
on
the
head
and
run
away
with
my
ship
no
promises
of
good
behaviour
from
vane
would
prevail
on
his
friend
to
rescue
him
in
fact
captain
holford
parting
remark
was
that
he
would
be
returning
in
a
month
and
that
if
he
then
found
vane
still
on
the
island
he
would
carry
him
to
jamaica
to
be
hanged
soon
after
holford
departure
another
ship
put
in
for
water
none
of
the
crew
of
which
knew
vane
by
sight
and
he
was
too
crafty
to
let
them
find
out
the
notorious
pirate
he
was
they
consented
to
take
off
the
shipwrecked
mariner
when
just
as
all
seemed
to
be
going
well
back
came
the
ship
of
friend
holford
holford
who
seems
to
have
been
a
sociable
kind
of
man
was
well
acquainted
with
the
captain
who
was
befriending
vane
and
holford
was
invited
to
dine
on
board
his
ship
as
the
guest
was
passing
along
the
deck
of
his
host
ship
on
his
way
to
the
great
cabin
he
chanced
to
glance
down
the
open
hold
and
there
who
should
he
see
but
his
dear
old
friend
vane
hard
at
work
for
he
had
already
won
his
new
good
graces
by
being
a
brisk
hand
holford
at
once
informed
his
host
that
he
was
entertaining
a
notorious
pirate
and
with
his
consent
clapped
vane
in
irons
and
removed
him
to
his
own
ship
and
when
he
arrived
in
jamaica
handed
his
old
friend
to
the
justices
who
quickly
tried
convicted
and
hanged
him
vanhorn
captain
nicholas
a
dutch
filibuster
of
hispaniola
sailed
from
england
in
in
command
of
the
and
the
a
merchant
ship
vanhorn
soon
showed
his
hand
by
putting
two
of
his
merchants
ashore
at
cadiz
and
stealing
four
spanish
guns
next
he
sailed
to
the
canary
islands
and
then
to
the
guinea
coast
plundering
ships
and
stealing
negroes
until
november
when
he
arrived
at
the
city
of
san
domingo
in
april
he
picked
up
some
buccaneers
at
petit
goave
and
joined
the
filibuster
laurens
in
the
gulf
of
honduras
with
six
other
buccaneer
captains
who
were
planning
an
attack
on
the
rich
city
of
vera
cruz
the
fleet
arrived
off
the
city
in
may
and
the
pirates
hearing
that
the
spaniards
were
expecting
the
arrival
of
two
ships
from
caracas
they
crowded
a
landing
party
of
men
into
two
ships
and
displaying
spanish
colours
stood
in
boldly
for
the
city
the
inhabitants
imagining
these
were
the
ships
they
were
expecting
actually
lit
bonfires
to
pilot
them
into
the
harbour
landing
on
may
two
miles
away
they
soon
found
themselves
masters
of
the
town
and
forts
all
the
sentinels
being
asleep
for
four
days
they
plundered
the
churches
convents
and
houses
and
threatened
to
burn
the
cathedral
in
which
they
had
put
all
the
prisoners
unless
more
booty
was
forthcoming
an
englishman
found
the
governor
hiding
in
some
hay
in
a
loft
and
he
was
ransomed
for
pieces
of
eight
while
this
was
taking
place
a
spanish
fleet
of
fourteen
ships
had
arrived
from
cadiz
and
anchored
just
outside
the
harbour
but
would
not
venture
to
land
nor
to
attack
the
buccaneer
ships
the
buccaneers
feeling
it
was
time
to
depart
sailed
right
past
the
fleet
without
opposition
to
a
cay
not
far
off
and
there
divided
the
spoils
each
of
the
sailors
getting
pieces
of
eight
as
his
share
while
vanhorn
own
share
was
pieces
of
eight
this
division
of
the
spoil
did
not
take
place
without
some
bickering
and
the
two
leaders
vanhorn
and
laurens
came
to
blows
and
vanhorn
was
wounded
in
the
wrist
although
the
wound
was
little
more
than
a
scratch
he
died
of
gangrene
a
fortnight
later
it
is
significant
that
vanhorn
had
originally
been
sent
out
by
the
governor
of
hispaniola
to
hunt
for
pirates
but
once
out
of
sight
of
land
and
away
from
authority
the
temptation
to
get
rich
quickly
was
too
great
to
resist
so
that
he
joined
the
pirates
in
the
expedition
to
sack
vera
cruz
veale
captain
on
july
he
arrived
at
new
london
in
a

but
was
compelled
to

place
called
lynn

the
boat
contained
besides
the
pirates
a
quantity
of
plunder
and
a
beautiful
young
woman
they
built
a
hut
on
dungeon
rock
dug
a
well
and
lived
there
until
the
woman
died
three
of
the
pirates
were
captured
and
ended
their
days
on
the
gallows
in
england
thomas
veale
escaped
and
went
to
live
in
a
cave
where
he
is
supposed
to
have
hidden
his
booty
but
he
continued
to
work
as
a
cordwainer
in
the
earthquake
of
the
cave
was
blocked
up
by

who
was
drying
of
gunpowder
in
a
silver

not

it

scorch
my

degree
that
the

was
left

the
flesh
being
torn
away
and
my
thigh
burnt
for
a
great
way
above

unwilling
to

by

companions
i
made
hard
shift
to
jog
on
the
whole
story
of
these
adventures
is
told

and
his
companions
suffered
extreme
hardships
as
they
struggled
through
the
dense
tropical
jungle
during
the
wettest
season
of
the
year
on
one
occasion
when
in
danger
of
his
life
wafer
was
spared
by
the
indians
owing
to
his
skill
as
a
phlebotomist
after
he
had
been
allowed
to
exhibit
his
skill
to
an
indian
chief
called
lacentra
when
he
bled
one
of
his
wives
so
successfully
that
the
chief
made
wafer
his
inseparable
companion
to
the
no
little
discomfort
of
the
buccaneer
who
wished
to
reach
the
atlantic
and
rejoin
his
companions
who
had
left
him
behind

described
the
birds

with
considerable
minuteness
although

is
obvious
that

no
special
training

one
of

watling

his

by
giving
orders
for

keeping

sunday
as
a
day
apart
the
first
for
many
months
one
of
the

acts
of

on

watling
headed

attack
on

three
warning

had
gathered
together
no
less
than
defenders
a
furious
attack

considerable

in
one
attack
watling
placed

his
prisoners

hoping
this
would
prevent
the
enemy
firing

a

at

time
he
had
not
forgotten
that
the

had
used
him

civilly

that

him
four

david
this
son
of
a
welsh
farmer
was
a
poor
pirate
but
a
born
soldier
he
was
described
by
one
who
knew
him
as
being
morose
sour
unsociable
and
and
that
he
knew
as
little
of
the
sea
or
of
ships
as
he
did
of
the
arts
of
natural
philosophy
but
it
is
recorded
to
his
credit
that
he
was
not
cruel
he
started
life
in
a
merchant
ship
bound
for
india
and
was
accidentally
left
behind
in
madagascar
taken
care
of
by
friendly
natives
he
fought
so
well
on
the
side
of
his
benefactors
in
an
battle
that
the
king
made
him
his
intimate
friend
a
little
later
this
tribe
was
wiped
out
and
williams
taken
prisoner
the
king
of
this
hostile
tribe
knowing
williams
to
be
a
brave
man
put
him
in
charge
of
his
army
for
his
success
as
a
leader
was
known
far
and
wide
he
was
next
seized
by
a
very
powerful
king
dempaino
who
made
him
over
his
army
of
men
and
supplied
him
with
slaves
clothes
and
everything
he
could
want
after
several
years
as

a
pirate
ship
the
captain

arrived
on

escaped
in

and
went

was
afterwards

dutch
pirate

made
to
work
as
a

on

months
he
escaped

sought
safety
with
a
prince

with
whom
he
lived
for

year

next
joined

now
spent
his
time
pirating
unsuccessfully
until
one
day
in
a
sloop
he
attempted
a
raid
on
an
arab
town
at
boyn
this
attempt
proved
a
fiasco
and
williams
was
caught
by
the
arabs
cruelly
tortured
and
finally
killed
by
a
lance
thrust
he
was
so
loved
and
admired
by
the
madagascar
natives
that
his
friend
and
benefactor
king
dempaino
seized
the
arab
chief
of
boyn
and
executed
him
in
revenge
for
the
death
of
williams
williams
seems
to
have
been
as
much
beloved
by
the
natives
as
he
was
hated
by
men
of
his
own
colour
as
a
pirate
he
was
a
failure
but
as
a
