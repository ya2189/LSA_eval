school
history
of
north
carolina
from
to
the
present
time
by
john
moore
revised
and
enlarged
preface
to
revised
edition
in
the
publication
of
a
fourteenth
edition
it
seems
proper
that
something
should
be
said
as
to
changes
made
in
this
work
at
a
session
of
the
north
carolina
board
of
education
held
november
it
was
resolved
that
the
board
expressly
reserve
to
itself
the
right
to
require
further
revisions
in
moore
school
history
of
north
carolina
the
second
edition
of
which
was
then
adopted
for
use
in
the
public
schools
conforming
to
this
requirement
of
the
state
board
of
education
the
author
has
diligently
sought
aid
and
counsel
in
the
effort
to
perfect
this
work
to
spencer
hale
of
new
york
and
hon
montford
mcgehee
commissioner
of
agriculture
the
work
is
indebted
for
many
valuable
suggestions
but
still
more
largely
to
saunders
secretary
of
state
who
has
aided
assiduously
not
only
in
its
revision
but
in
its
progress
through
the
press
the
teacher
of
north
carolina
history
will
be
greatly
aided
in
the
work
by
having
a
wall
map
of
north
carolina
before
the
class
and
to
this
end
the
publishers
have
prepared
a
good
and
accurate
school
map
which
will
be
furnished
at
a
special
low
price

questions
on
the
constitution
hints
to
teachers
it
is
well
known
that
any
subject
can
be
more
thoroughly
taught
when
both
the
eye
and
the
mind
of
the
pupil
are
used
as
mediums
for
imparting
the
knowledge
and
the
teacher
of
north
carolina
history
will
find
a
valuable
help
in
a
wall
map
of
the
state
hung
in
convenient
position
for
reference
while
the
history
class
is
reciting
require
the
pupils
to
go
to
the
map
and
point
out
localities
when
mentioned
also
places
adjoining
trace
the
courses
of
the
rivers
which
have
a
historical
interest
and
name
important
towns
upon
their
banks
a
good
reliable
wall
map
of
north
carolina
can
he
procured
at
a
moderate
price
from
the
publishers
of
this
work
it
has
been
deemed
proper
to
make
the
chapters
short
that
each
may
form
one
lesson
at
the
close
of
each
chapter
will
be
found
questions
upon
the
main
points
of
the
lesson
these
will
furnish
thought
for
many
other
questions
which
will
suggest
themselves
to
the
teacher
there
are
many
small
matters
of
local
state
history
which
can
be
given
with
interest
to
the
class
from
time
to
time
as
appropriate
periods
are
reached
these
minor
facts
could
not
be
included
in
the
compass
of
a
school
book
but
a
teacher
will
be
helped
by
referring
occasionally
to
moore
library
history
of
north
carolina
inspire
your
pupils
with
a
spirit
of
patriotism
and
love
for
their
native
state
a
little
effort
in
this
direction
will
show
you
how
easily
it
can
be
done
in
every
boy
and
girl
is
a
latent
feeling
of
pride
in
whatever
pertains
to
the
welfare
of
their
native
state
and
this
feeling
should
be
cultivated
and
enlarged
and
thus
the
children
make
better
citizens
when
grown
the
history
of
our
state
is
filled
with
events
which
told
to
the
young
will
fix
their
attention
and
awaken
a
desire
to
know
more
of
the
troubles
and
noble
deeds
of
the
people
who
laid
the
foundation
of
this
commonwealth
the
appendix
contains
the
present
constitution
of
north
carolina
then
follows
a
series
of
questions
on
the
constitution
prepared
expressly
for
this
work
by
hon
kemp
battle
ll
president
of
the
university
of
north
carolina
this
is
an
entirely
new
and
valuable
feature
in
a
school
book
and
contains
an
analysis
of
our
state
government
this
is
just
the
information
that
every
citizen
of
north
carolina
ought
to
possess
and
teachers
should
require
all
their
students
of
this
history
to
read
and
study
the
constitution
and
endeavor
to
answer
the
questions
thereon
no
state
in
the
union
possesses
a
record
of
nobler
achievements
than
north
carolina
her
people
have
always
loved
liberty
for
themselves
and
they
offered
the
same
priceless
boon
to
all
who
came
within
her
borders
and
it
was
a
full
knowledge
of
this
trait
of
our
people
which
made
bancroft
say
north
carolina
was
settled
by
the
freest
of
the
free
chapter
i
physical
description
of
north
carolina
the
state
of
north
carolina
is
included
between
the
parallels
and
north
latitude
and
between
the
meridians
and
west
longitude
its
western
boundary
is
the
crest
of
the
smoky
mountains
which
with
the
blue
ridge
forms
a
part
of
the
great
appalachian
system
extending
almost
from
the
mouth
of
the
lawrence
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
its
eastern
is
the
atlantic
ocean
its
mean
breadth
from
north
to
south
is
about
one
hundred
miles
its
extreme
breadth
is
one
hundred
and
miles
the
extreme
length
of
the
state
from
east
to
west
is
five
hundred
miles
the
area
embraced
within
its
boundaries
is
thousand
two
hundred
and
square
miles
the
climate
of
north
carolina
is
mild
and
equable
this
is
due
in
part
to
its
geographical
position
midway
as
it
were
between
the
northern
and
southern
limits
of
the
union
two
other
causes
concur
to
modify
it
the
one
the
lofty
appalachian
chain
which
forms
to
some
extent
a
shield
from
the
bleak
winds
of
the
northwest
the
other
the
softening
influence
of
the
gulf
stream
the
current
of
which
sweeps
along
near
its
shores
the
result
of
these
combined
causes
is
shown
in
the
character
of
the
seasons
fogs
are
almost
unknown
frosts
occur
not
until
the
middle
of
october
ice
rarely
forms
of
a
sufficient
thickness
to
be
gathered
snows
are
light
seldom
remaining
on
the
ground
more
than
two
or
three
days
the
average
rainfall
is
about
three
inches
which
is
pretty
uniformly
distributed
throughout
the
year
the
climate
is
eminently
favorable
to
health
and
longevity
the
state
falls
naturally
into
three
divisions
or
sections
the
western
or
mountain
section
the
middle
or
piedmont
section
and
the
eastern
or
tidewater
section
the
first
consists
of
mountains
many
of
them
rising
to
towering
heights
the
highest
indeed
east
of
the
rocky
mountains
it
is
bounded
on
the
east
by
the
blue
ridge
and
on
the
west
by
the
smoky
mountains
the
section
inclosed
within
these
limits
is
in
shape
somewhat
like
an
ellipse
its
length
is
about
one
hundred
and
eighty
miles
its
average
breadth
from
twenty
to
fifty
miles
it
is
a
high
plateau
from
the
plane
of
which
many
lofty
mountains
everywhere
rise
and
on
its
border
the
culminating
points
of
the
appalachian
system
the
roau
the
grandfather
and
the
black
lift
their
heads
to
the
sky
between
the
mountains
are
fertile
valleys
plentifully
watered
by
streams
many
of
them
remarkable
for
their
beauty
the
mountains
themselves
are
wooded
except
a
few
which
have
prairies
on
their
summits
locally
distinguished
as
balds
this
section
has
long
been
one
of
the
favorite
resorts
of
the
tourist
and
the
painter
the
middle
section
lies
between
the
blue
ridge
and
the
falls
where
the
rivers
make
their
descent
into
the
great
plain
which
forms
the
eastern
section
of
the
state
its
area
comprises
nearly
of
the
territory
of
the
state
throughout
the
greater
part
it
presents
an
endless
succession
of
hills
and
dales
though
the
surface
near
the
mountains
is
of
a
bolder
and
sometimes
of
a
rugged
cast
the
scenery
of
this
section
is
as
remarkable
for
quiet
picturesque
beauty
as
that
of
the
western
is
for
sublimity
and
grandeur
the
eastern
section
is
a
champaign
country
relieved
however
by
gentle
undulations
its
breadth
is
about
one
hundred
miles
its
principal
beauty
lies
in
its
river
scenery
and
extensive
water
prospects
the
cultivated
productions
of
the
mountain
section
are
corn
wheat
oats
barley
hay
tobacco
fruits
and
vegetables
cattle
are
also
reared
quite
extensively
for
market
in
the
middle
section
are
found
all
the
productions
of
the
former
and
over
the
southern
half
cotton
appears
as
the
staple
product
in
the
eastern
section
cotton
corn
oats
and
rice
are
staple
crops
and
the
trucking
business
growing
fruits
and
vegetables
for
the
northern
markets
constitutes
a
flourishing
industry
the
lumber
business
and
the
various
industries
to
which
the
leaf
pine
gives
rise
tar
pitch
and
turpentine
have
long
been
and
still
continue
to
be
great
resources
of
wealth
for
this
section
of
the
crops
produced
in
the
united
states
all
are
grown
in
north
carolina
except
sugar
and
some
fruits
as
the
orange
the
lemon
and
the
banana
the
wine
grapes
of
america
may
be
said
to
have
their
home
in
north
carolina
four
of
them
the
catawba
isabella
lincoln
and
scuppernong
originated
here
the
physical
characteristics
of
the
state
will
be
better
understood
by
picturing
to
the
mind
its
surface
as
spread
out
upon
a
vast
declivity
sloping
down
from
the
summits
of
the
smoky
mountains
an
altitude
of
near
seven
thousand
feet
to
the
ocean
level
through
the
range
of
elevation
thus
afforded
the
plants
and
trees
or
what
is
comprehended
under
the
term
flora
vary
from
those
peculiar
to
alpine
regions
to
those
peculiar
to
tropical
regions
the
variety
of
trees
is
most
marked
including
all
those
which
yield
timber
employed
in
the
useful
and
many
of
those
employed
in
the
ornamental
arts
indeed
nearly
all
the
species
found
in
the
united
states
east
of
the
rocky
mountains
are
found
in
north
carolina
her
wealth
in
this
respect
will
be
appreciated
when
the
striking
fact
is
mentioned
that
there
are
more
species
of
oaks
in
north
carolina
than
in
all
the
states
north
of
us
and
only
one
less
than
in
all
the
southern
states
east
of
the
mississippi
this
range
of
elevation
affords
also
a
great
variety
of
medicinal
herbs
in
fact
the
mountains
of
north

are

of
the

chapter
ii
physical
the
mountains
of
north
carolina
may
be
conveniently
classed
as
four
separate
chains
the
smoky
forming
the
western
boundary
of
the
state
the
blue
ridge
running
across
the
state
in
a
very
tortuous
course
and
shooting
out
spurs
of
great
elevation
the
brushy
which
divides
for
the
greater
part
of
its
course
the
waters
of
the
catawba
and
yadkin
beginning
at
a
point
near
lenoir
and
terminating
in
the
pilot
and
sauratown
mountains
and
an
inferior
range
of
much
lower
elevation
which
may
be
termed
from
its
local
name
at
different
points
the
uwharrie
or
oconeechee
mountains
beginning
in
montgomery
county
and
terminating
in
the
heights
about
roxboro
in
person
county
each
of
these
mountain
ranges
is
marked
by
distinct
characteristics
the
smoky
chain
as
contrasted
with
the
next
highest
the
blue
ridge
is
more
continuous
more
elevated
more
regular
in
its
direction
and
height
and
rises
very
uniformly
from
five
thousand
to
nearly
six
thousand
seven
hundred
feet
the
blue
ridge
is
composed
of
many
fragments
scarcely
connected
into
a
continuous
and
regular
chain
its
loftier
summits
range
from
five
thousand
to
five
thousand
nine
hundred
feet
the
brushy
range
presents
throughout
the
greater
part
of
its
course
a
remarkable
uniformity
in
direction
and
elevation
many
of
its
peaks
rising
above
two
thousand
feet
the
last
the
oconeechee
or
uwharrie
range
sometimes
presents
a
succession
of
elevated
ridges
then
a
number
of
bold
and
isolated
knobs
whose
heights
are
one
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
level
there
are
three
distinct
systems
of
rivers
in
the
state
those
that
find
their
way
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
through
the
mississippi
those
that
flow
through
south
carolina
to
the
sea
and
those
that
reach
the
sea
along
our
own
coast
the
divide
between
the
first
and
the
second
is
the
blue
ridge
chain
of
mountains
that
between
the
second
and
third
systems
is
found
in
an
elevation
extending
from
the
blue
ridge
near
the
virginia
line
just
between
the
sources
of
the
yadkin
and
the
roanoke
in
a
direction
some
two
hundred
miles
almost
to
the
below
wilmington
in
the
divide
between
the
first
and
second
systems
which
is
also
the
great
watershed
between
the
atlantic
slope
and
the
mississippi
valley
a
singular
anomaly
is
presented
for
it
is
formed
not
by
the
lofty
smoky
range
but
by
the
blue
ridge
not
therefore
at
the
crest
of
the
great
slope
which
the
surface
of
the
state
presents
but
on
a
line
lower
down
on
the
western
flank
of
this
lower
range
the
beautiful
french
broad
and
the
other
rivers
of
the
first
section
including
the
headwaters
of
the
great
khanawha
have
their
rise
in
their
course
through
the
smoky
mountains
to
the
mississippi
they
pass
along
chasms
or
gaps
from
three
thousand
to
four
thousand
feet
in
depth
these
chasms
or
gaps
are
more
than
a
thousand
feet
lower
than
those
of
the
corresponding
parts
of

geological
characteristics
a
knowledge
of
the
geology
of
a
state
affords
the
key
to
its
soils
since
the
soils
are
formed
by
the
disintegration
of
the
underlying
rocks
more
or
less
mixed
with
animal
or
vegetable
matter
the
peculiar
geological
structure
of
the
state
furnishes
the
material
for
every
possible
variety
of
soil
in
fact
there
is
no
description
or
combination
unrepresented
there
are
first
the
black
and
deep
peaty
soils
of
hyde
county
and
the
great
swamp
tracts
along
the
eastern
border
of
the
tidewater
section
then
come
the
alluvious
marls
and
light
sandy
soils
of
the
more
elevated
portions
of
the
same
section
then
the
clayey
sandy
and
gravelly
soils
of
the
piedmont
and
mountain
section
the
result
of
the
decomposition
of
every
variety
of
rock
from
its
western
boundary
to
the
last
falls
of
its
rivers
the
rocks
generally
belong
to
that
formation
known
as
primitive
primitive
rocks
are
easily
distinguished
they
are
crystalline
in
structure
and
have
no
animal
or
vegetable
remains
called
fossils
imbedded
or
preserved
in
them
the
soils
of
this
formation
are
not
very
fertile
nor
yet
are
they
sterile
they
are
of
medium
quality
and
susceptible
under
skilful
culture
of
the
highest
improvement
the
primitive
rocks
are
chiefly
represented
by
granite
and
gneiss
the
rocks
of
the
secondary
formation
appear
in
certain
counties
of
the
piedmont
section
and
here
the
occur
embracing
many
hundred
square
miles
this
formation
consists
of
the
primitive
rocks
broken
down
by
natural
agents
and
subsequently
deposited
in
beds
of
a
thickness
from
a
few
feet
to
many
hundred
and
abounds
in
organic
remains
the
soils
of
this
formation
vary
more
than
the
former
as
the
one
or
the
other
of
the
materials
of
which
they
are
made
up
happens
to
predominate
the
eastern
section
belongs
to
that
which
is
known
as
the
quaternary
formation
here
no
rocks
like
those
mentioned
above
are
found
indeed
rocks
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
that
term
are
unknown
this
formation
will
be
best
understood
by
regarding
it
as
an
ocean
bed
laid
bare
by
upheaval
through
some
convulsion
of
nature
and
thus
made
dry
land
sandy
soils
predominate
somewhat
in
this
section
though
there
are
tracts
in
which
clay
is
in
great
excess
and
other
tracts
in
which
vegetable
matter
is
in
great
excess
between
these
extremes
there
exist
also
the
usual
mixtures
in
various
proportions
geology
also
affords
a
key
to
the
mineral
resources
of
a
state
those
of
the
tidewater
section
are
summed
up
in
its
marls
that
whole
section
is
underlaid
with
marl
at
a
depth
of
a
few
feet
and
in
quantity
sufficient
to
raise
and
keep
it
when
regularly
applied
to
the
surface
for
all
time
to
come
at
the
highest
point
of
productiveness
of
all
resources
for
wealth
this
is
the
most
durable
and
on
account
of
the
industry
to
which
it
is
subservient
the
agricultural
is
best
calculated
to
promote
the
happiness
of
man
it
is
in
the
primitive
rocks
however
that
minerals
abound
those
of
north

surpass
any

the

in
the
last

silver
copper
lead
iron
mica

etc
the
most
of
these
are
the
subjects
of
great
mining
industries
which
are
daily
developing
to
greater
proportions
of
some
of
these
minerals
as
corundum
and

north

has
already
become
the
chief
source
of
supply
among
the
principal
sources
of
the
future
mineral
wealth
of
the
state
copper
gold
and
iron
are
clearly
indicated
the
ores
of
these
metals
are
found
in
abundance
over
extensive
tracts
of
country
lastly
in
north
carolina
many
beautiful
specimens
of
the
precious
stones
have
been
found
and
a
large
capital
has
been
raised
to
carry
on
mining
as
a
regular
business
for
one
of
these
the
hiddenite
gem
north
carolina
will
thus
be
seen
to
be
a
state
of
vast
resources
whether
we
regard
the
variety
and
value
of
her
natural
or
cultivated
productions
the
immense
range
of
her
minerals
or
her
facilities
for
manufacturing
industries
it
would
perhaps
be
safe
to
say
that
no
equal
portion
of
the
earth
surface
will
in
half
a
century
be
the
scene
of
industries
so
various

possess
chapter
iv
the
indians
that
portion
of
america
now
known
as
the
state
of
north
carolina
was
once
inhabited
by
indians
for
many
ages
before
columbus
came
across
the
seas
in
the
year
they
had
held
undisputed
possession
of
all
the
western
continent
except
those
arctic
regions
where
the
esquimaux
dwelt
nearly
a
century
had
gone
by
since
the
spaniards
had
begun
their
settlements
and
yet
north
of
augustine
in
florida
not
a
white
man
was
to
be
found
cortez
and
pizarro
had
founded
great
states
in
mexico
and
peru
but
the
vast
region
stretching
from
the
rio
grande
to
the
lawrence
was
still
the
home
of
only
red
men
and
the
wild
beasts
of
the
forest
there
were
many
different
tribes
and
languages
to
be
found
among
the
indians
in
north
carolina
the
tuscaroras
lived
in
the
east
the
catawbas
in
the
middle
and
the
cherokees
in
the
western
portion
of
the
territory
as
now
defined
there
were
corees
meherrins
chowanokes
and
other
small
tribes
in
the
east
but
they
were
weak
in
numbers
and
occupied
but
a
small
portion
of
our
present
state
limits
the
treacherous
tuscaroras
were
a
portion
of
a
powerful
race
known
as
the
iroquois
the
other
five
nations
of
this
family
dwelt
in
the
lake
country
of
new
york
and
were
the
most
daring
and
dangerous
confederation
among
all
indians
then
known
to
the
white
people
these
iroquois
of
the
north
were
generally
friendly
to
the
english
but
waged
almost
ceaseless
war
upon
the
french
and
a
tribe
of
indians
called
the
algonquins
the
tuscaroras
were
generally
to
be
found
in
the
country
watered
by
the
roanoke
and
neuse
rivers
and
were
the
terror
of
all
other
tribes
it
is
not
known
when
they
had
separated
from
their
northern
relatives
they
kept
up
amicable
relations
with
them
and
messengers
and
embassies
occasionally
passed
between
the
banks
of
the
roanoke
and
the
settlements
on
the
northern
lakes
the
catawbas
roamed
over
the
fair
regions
through
which
flow
the
catawba
and
yadkin
rivers
westward
of
them
were
to
be
found
in
the
mountains
the
numerous
bands
of
the
cherokees
amid
the
towering
peaks
and
along
the
beautiful
french
broad
and
other
rivers
lived
and
hunted
these
simple
children
of
the
hills
they
were
generally
disposed
to
peace
and
were
averse
to
leaving
the
paradise
they
inhabited
for
the
dangerous
honor
of
the
warpath
the
indians
were
in
many
respects
a
peculiar
people
though
ignorant
and
savage
they
were
not
idolaters
they
believed
in
one
god
whom
they
called
the
great
spirit
they
were
not
shepherds
or
farmers
for
they
had
no
domestic
animals
except
dogs
and
their
corn
fields
were
but
insignificant
patches
cleared
and
cultivated
by
their
women
they
cleared
these
little
patches
of
land
by
burning
down
the
trees
and
their
plow
was
a
crooked
stick
with
which
they
scratched
over
the
ground
for
planting
the
corn
the
men
hunted
and
fought
with
other
tribes
but
disdained
to
be
found
engaged
in
any
useful
labor
such
habits
made
large
areas
of
land
necessary
for
the
subsistence
of
the
people
thus
all
of
the
tribes
were
jealous
of
the
intrusion
of
others
upon
their
hunting
grounds
and
whenever
one
found
another
getting
closer
than
usual
war
was
begun
their
lives
were
filled
with
terror
and
apprehension
not
knowing
when
some
enemy
would
kill
and
scalp
every
person
in
the
tribe
the
meherrins
lived
in
the
fork
of
meherrin
and
chowan
rivers
they
were
long
at
war
with
the
nottoways
who
lived
in
virginia
south
of
james
river
the
meherrins
at
last
left
their
old
men
women
and
children
and
went
on
the
warpath
against
their
enemies
who
happened
to
be
approaching
them
on
a
similar
errand
they
chanced
to
miss
each
other
and
the
nottoways
therefore
found
the
lodges
of
their
foes
completely
undefended
and
they
slew
every
human
being
in
the
captured
village
the
meherrins
left
their
old
homes
in
despair
and
disappeared
in
the
west
this
occurred
after
many
white
people
had
settled
in
the
albemarle
country
such
a
state
of
society
necessitated
the
control
of
one
leader
so
the
indian
tribes
were
governed
by
chiefs
who
led
them
to
battle
and
in
pursuit
of
game
some
of
these
chiefs
like
powhatan
and
king
philip
were
men
of
marked
ability
and
extended
their
power
over
other
tribes
when
a
chief
died
his
son
succeeded
to
his
office
only
when
fitted
for
the
place
if
weak
or
cowardly
some
other
brave
was
chosen
in
this
way
the
honor
was
not
strictly
hereditary
the
indians
had
no
knowledge
as
to
the
working
of
iron
they
had
only
bows
arrows
stone
tomahawks
and
such
weapons
for
war
they
lived
in
small
communities
embracing
from
ten
to
thirty
cabins
for
protection
but
had
no
large
towns
because
of
the
impossibility
of
feeding
great
numbers
at
one
point
they
held
it
a
part
of
their
religion
to
seek
vengeance
for
all
injuries
real
and
imaginary
and
their
general
traits
of
character
were
as
savage
as
their
habits
in
war
they
had
no
pity
on
captives
no
reverence
for
helpless
age
and
were
strangers
to
the
sentiments
of
honor
and
justice
they
were
brave
yet
much
given
to
cunning
and
treachery
they
rarely
forgot
benefits
or
forgave
injuries
many
relics
of
these
savages
are
yet
to
be
found
in
almost
every
county
throughout
the
state
broken
pieces
of
pottery
arrowheads
and
tomahawks
are
often
plowed
up
in
the
fields
and
mounds
of
various
sizes
made
by
the
indians
are
still
seen
in
some
sections
there
had
long
been
a
tradition
among
the
indians
that
in
the
course
of
time
strangers
from
beyond
the
seas
would
possess
their
land
and
so
after
ages
of
petty
warfare
among
themselves
as
the
sixteenth
century
drew
to
its
close
they
were
confronted
by
men
who
built
ships
that
withstood
the
ocean
storms
and
shook
the
solid
earth
with
the
roar
of
their
artillery

in

thousands
of

were
living

england
in
that
time
was
ruled
by
queen
elizabeth
who
began
her
reign
in
ireland
and
the
small
islands
in
the
british
channel
were
the

still
an

monarchy
with

realm
this
queen
was

danger
of
dethronement
and
death
the
pope
the
catholic
kings
and
her
own
people
belonging
to

denied
her

to

and
sought
her
overthrow
and
that
of
the
protestant
religion
she
upheld
amid
so
many
dangers
and
difficulties
queen
elizabeth
by
wisdom
and
prudence
not
only
managed
to
defend
herself
but
became
one
of
the
greatest
rulers
of
any
age
she
devoted
her
energies
to
the
government
of
her
people
and
though
courted
by
many
princes
would
never
marry
for
fear
such
a
relation
would
impair
her
usefulness
as
a
queen
among
her
greatest
gifts
as
a
ruler
was
her
clear
insight
into
the
characters
of
men
she
knew
whom
to
employ
as
her
agents
and
was
rarely
deceived
as
to
how
far
she
could
trust
them
in
a
season
so
full
of
treason
and
danger
but
this
great
queen
who
humbled
the
most
powerful
monarchs
and
in
whose
presence
the
sternest
men
would
sometimes
tremble
was
after
all
a
very
vain
woman
nothing
pleased
her
more
even
in
her
old
age
than
praise
of
her
personal
appearance
one
evening
she
was
walking
at
the
head
of
a
procession
composed
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
her
court
when
she
encountered
a
muddy
place
in
her
pathway
the
stately
queen
paused
a
moment
seeming
in
doubt
as
to
whether
she
should
step
in
the
mud
or
pass
around
a
handsome
young
man
who
was
standing
near
by
snatched
a
velvet
cloak
from
his
shoulders
and
throwing
it
in
the
mud
for
her
majesty
to
step
upon
she
passed
over
with
dry
feet
queen
elizabeth
was
charmed
with
the
ready
gallantry
of
the
youth
she
made
inquiries
concerning
him
and
found
that
it
was
young
walter
raleigh
who
had
just
come
to
london
from
his
home
in
the
country
it
was
the
beginning
of
his
fortunes
at
court
and
he
soon
won
the
queen
confidence
and
respect
walter
raleigh
had
many
noble
and
generous
qualities
he
was
by
nature
brave
ambitious
and
enterprising
and
soon
became
a
great
and
learned
man
he
was
a
gallant
soldier
a
skilful
navigator
and
the
statesman
who
first
conceived
the
plan
for
extending
the
british
empire
while
serving
as
a
soldier
in
behalf
of
the
french
protestants
on
the
continent
of
europe
he
heard
and
read
so
much
of
the
wondrous
lands
across
the
atlantic
ocean
that
he
resolved
that
england
should
share
in
the
glory
and
profit
of
future
discoveries
when
raleigh
went
back
to
england
he
communicated
his
desires
and
feelings
to
his
sir
humphrey
gilbert
who
had
made
reputation
as
a
commander
of
ships
in
the
year
the
queen
granted
leave
to
these
two
men
to
sail
in
search
of
lands
yet
undiscovered
by
civilized
nations
in
they
sent
out
a
large
vessel
called
the
raleigh
it
is
said
that
the
vessel
was
commanded
by
sir
walter
raleigh
in
person
and
this
was
the
only
attempt
ever
made
by
him
to
visit
the
shores
of
north
which
was
compelled
to
return
in
a
few
days
on
account
of
disease
among
the
crew
english
sailors
at
that
time
were
easily
discouraged
in
efforts
to
navigate
the
atlantic
ocean
they
had
never
crossed
it
and
were
full
of
superstition
concerning
that
unknown
and
mysterious
sea
again
in
sir
humphrey
gilbert
with
three
ships
ventured
out
upon
the
waste
of
waters
that
lay
to
the
west
of
their
island
homes
he
discovered
the
island
of
newfoundland
and
thence
sailed
southward
off
the
coast
of
maine
he
was
overtaken
by
a
storm
which
sunk
one
of
his
ships
this
disaster
induced
him
to
turn
his
prows
for
the
voyage
homeward
but
the
storm
continued
and
the
darkness
and
horrors
of
the
sea
grew
tenfold
worse
when
they
found
themselves
amid
drifting
icebergs
brave
sir
humphrey
from
the
deck
of
his
ship

squirrel
to
the
last

the
men
of
her
consort
crying
out
cheer
up
my
lads
we
are
as
near
heaven
at
sea
as
on
land
when
the
terrible
night
had
passed
it
was
found
that
sir
humphrey
gilbert
and
his
crew
had
perished
and
only
the
hind
was
left
to
carry
back
the
disheartening
tidings
to
raleigh
and
the
english
queen
the
vessel
which
carried
sir
humphrey
gilbert
and
his
crew
was
of
only
ten
tons
burden
and
very
poorly
able
to
stand
the
gales
along
the
american
coast
the
delight
another
one
of
the
fleet
had
gone
down
a
few
days
before
the
loss
of
the
squirrel
note
in
the
year
a
spanish
vessel
commanded
by
vasques
de
ayllon
was
driven
by
a
violent
storm
upon
the
coast
of
carolina
the
commander
was
kindly
treated
by
the
natives
and
in
return
he
enticed
a
number
of
them
on
board
his
ship
and
tried
to
carry
them
to
hispaniola
but
the
indians
preferred
death
to
captivity
they
all
refused
to
partake
of
any
food
and
thus
died
of
voluntary
starvation

and

many
of

had
gone
down
into
the
depths
of

was

much
dreaded
there
was

and
possibly
many
bitter
speeches
were

raleigh
was
sorely
afflicted
at
the
loss
of
his

and
men
and
had
he
been
weak
or
selfish
this
disaster
would
have
unmanned
him
and
he
would
have
ventured
on
no
more
such
projects
he
had
lost
many
thousands
of
dollars
in

foundered
ships
and

gallant
friend
that
had
trusted
him
and

schemes
had
perished

the
hearts
of
heroes
are
not
cast
in

instead
of
abandoning

enterprise
he
obtained
on
march
from
the
queen
favoring
another
expedition
and
he
at
once
began
to
fit
out
another
fleet
this
consisted
of
two
vessels
and
they
were
put
under
the
command
of
philip
amadas
and
arthur
barlowe
note
the
queen
to
raleigh
gave
him
free
liberty
to
discover
such
remote
heathen
and
barbarous
lands
not
actually
possessed
by
any
christian
prince
nor
inhabited
by
christian
people
the
fleet
sailed
from
england
on
the
day
of
april
and
avoiding
the
dangers
of
in
the
northern
waters
steered
for
the
canary
islands
and
the
west
indies
they
had
the
good
fortune
to
escape
the
spanish
cruisers
which
were
so
dangerous
to
english
vessels
sailing
at
that
day
upon
this
course
on
the
day
of
july
they
first
saw
the
coast
of
north
carolina
probably
at
a
point
just
below
old
topsail
inlet
they
continued
northward
along
the
low
barren
barriers
of
sand
which
divide
the
waters
of
the
ocean
from
those
of
pamlica
and
croatan
sounds
and
two
days
later
came
to
anchor
off
an
island
called
wocoken
in
what
was
an
inlet
at
that
day
they
called
this
place
trinity
harbor
across
the
desolate
sand
ridges
were
fair
landlocked
waters
and
great
forests
that
sent
far
out
to
sea
the
odors
of
countless
flowers
the
weary
toilers
who
had
sailed
so
far
with
nothing
to
look
upon
but
the
sky
and
the
great
stretches
of
the
sea
were
charmed
with
the
richness
of
the
vegetation
the
balmy
air
and
the
ceaseless
songs
of
the
mockingbirds
for
two
whole
days
it
seemed
that
the
country
was
uninhabited
for
no
one
had
been
seen
by
the
englishmen
at
the
expiration
of
that
period
they
saw
a
canoe
approaching
from
the
north
in
which
were
three
indians
one
of
them
landed
and
came
down
the
beach
toward
the
ships
by
signs
he
was
invited
aboard
the
vessels
and
went
with
the
white
men
to
survey
some
of
the
wonders
of
civilization
found
in
various
parts
of
the
vessel
it
must
have
been
a
notable
day
in
this
indian
life
when
for
the
first
time
he
who
had
seen
nothing
of
the
kind
larger
than
his
canoe
beheld
the
tall
poops
the
towering
masts
and
the
great
sails
of
vessels
that
had
come
from
such
distant
lands
beyond
the
seas
nothing
so
astonished
the
indians
of
that
day
as
the
roar
of
artillery
it
was
something
entirely
beyond
their
comprehension
and
filled
them
with
terror
they
had
no
guns
or
knowledge
of
their
use
so
when
a
cannon
was
fired
they
were
ready
to
believe
that
men
who
could
do
such
things
were
possessed
of
supernatural
powers
the
officers
of
the
vessel
gave
to
the
indian
a
hat
shirt
and
several
other
articles
besides
treating
him
to
wine
and
meat
which
he
seemed
to
greatly
relish
as
a
return
for
their
kindness
the
indian
took
his
canoe
and
showed
the
white
men
how
to
catch
fish
in
a
half
hour
he
had
nearly
filled
his
boat
with
those
delicious
fish
which
have
always
so
remarkably
abounded
in
all
the
waters
of
that
portion
of
north
carolina
by
signs
he
made
known
his
wish
that
they
should
be
divided
between
the
men
of
the
two
ships
and
then
he
took
his
departure
the
next
day
many
indians
with
much
ceremony
visited
the
ships
among
them
was
granganimeo
a
brother
of
the
chief
who
ruled
in
that
portion
of
the
country
he
was
an
honest
and
kindly
indian
faithful
to
his
promises
and
affording
a
strong
contrast
to
wingina
the
indian
king
who
was
full
of
suspicion
and
duplicity
the
indians
were
clothed
in
mantles
and
aprons
of
deerskins
they
were
gentle
unsuspicious
and
hospitable
a
few
days
later
amadas
with
eight
of
his
men
in
a
boat
visited
the
home
of
granganimeo
about
twenty
miles
distant
on
the
shore
of
roanoke
island
the
chief
was
not
at
home
but
his
wife
gave
them
a
cordial
and
hospitable
reception
she
prepared
a
feast
for
them
of
fruits
melons
fish
and
venison
and
showed
them
every
kindness
amadas
and
barlowe
proceeded
in
the
presence
of
many
indians
to
lay
claim
to
the
country
for
their
queen
this
whole
pageant
was
probably
a
dumb
show
to
the
astonished
and
ignorant
natives
they
neither
knew
nor
cared
what
the
white
men
were
celebrating
with
beating
drums
flaunting
banners
and
salvos
of
artillery
this
expedition
had
not
been
sent
with
any
purpose
of
settlement
so
in
a
few
weeks
after
the
ceremony
of
taking
possession
the
fleet
weighed
anchor
and
sailed
back
to
england
they
carried
with
them
a
large
cargo
of
skins
and
valuable
woods
which
they
had
obtained
in
trading
with
the
indians
for
a
bright
tin
dish
the
indians
gave
twenty
skins
worth
about
five
dollars
and
fifty
valuable
skins
were
given
for
an
old
copper
kettle
amadas
and
barlowe
also
carried
to
england
the
first
knowledge
of
the
potato
and
tobacco
with
their
own
consent
two
indians
named
manteo
and
wanchese
were
taken
aboard
and
carried
to
england
that
they
might
see
something
of
the
world
across
the
sea
they
afforded
a
singular
test
of
human
nature
they
were
of
equal
abilities
and
yet
by
the
visit
to
england
manteo
became
the
friend
wanchese
the
implacable
enemy
of
the
white
men
note
the
indians
were
greatly
amazed
at
the
sight
of
gunpowder
the
cause
of
all
the
noise
in
the
artillery
on
one
of
their
expeditions
they
captured
a
quantity
of
powder
from
the
colonists
and
to
increase
the
supply
they
made
rows
in
the
ground
and
carefully
planted
the
black
grains
of
powder
expecting
to
reap
a
full
harvest
of
it
in
queen
elizabeth
was
greatly
pleased
by
the
glowing
descriptions
of
the
new
country
as
given
by
the
returned
mariners
especially
by
the
accounts
of
the
abundance
of
fruits
vines
hanging
with
luscious
grapes
great
forests
rich
shrubbery
and
bright
flowers
and
she
gave
the
country
the
name
of

in
honor
of
herself
the

soon

did
raleigh
soon
become
a
member
what
title
was
then
conferred
upon
him
and
why
chapter
vii
governor
lane
colony
to
we
can
not
easily
realize
in
our
day
what
excitement
and
enthusiasm
were
felt
in
england
when
the
two
ships
returned
and
exhibited
the
indians
the
potatoes
the
tobacco
and
other
new
and
strange
productions
that
had
been
gathered
by
amadas
and
barlowe
to
prove
the
value
and
fertility
of
the
newly
discovered
land
it
is
strange
but
true
that
more
value
was
set
upon
the
discovery
of
the
sassafras
tree
than
upon
anything
else
and
wonderful
things
were
expected
of
its
virtues
as
a
tea
a
medicine
and
for
the
manufacture
of
perfume
note
sir
walter
raleigh
planted
some
of
the
potatoes
upon
his
own
estate
and
found
them
very
palatable
other
people
afterwards
obtained
seed
from
him
and
now
the
potato
forms
a
principal
part
of
the
food
of
ireland
raleigh
was
also
the
first
englishman
who
ever
used
tobacco
an
amusing
incident
is
related
of
his
using
it
his
servant
entered
the
room
one
day
bringing
a
mug
of
ale
while
raleigh
was
enjoying
his
pipe
and
tobacco
and
the
smoke
was
issuing
from
his
mouth
and
filling
the
room
the
servant
thinking
that
his
master
was
on
fire
immediately
dashed
the
ale
in
his
face
and
ran
out
crying
for
help
for
his
master
would
be
burnt
to
ashes
sir
walter
raleigh
hastened
to
send
over
a
colony
of
men
to
take
possession
of
roanoke
ralph
lane
a
gentleman
of
courage
and
experience
was
appointed
governor
the
seven
ships
conveying
one
hundred
and
eight
emigrants
and
the
two
indians
who
had
visited
england
sailed
on
the
of
april
they
were
commanded
by
sir
richard
grenville
who
was
a
cousin
of
raleigh
and
famous
as
a
seaman
this
fleet
also
came
over
by
the
southern
route
and
was
in
considerable
danger
off
cape
fear
during
a
great
storm
but
the
ships
all
safely
rode
out
the
gale
and
on
the
of
july
they
dropped
their
anchors
in
trinity
harbor
off
the
coast
where
the
fleet
had
lain
during
the
visit
of
the
previous
year
news
of
the
arrival
was
at
once
sent
to
wingina
at
roanoke
island
governor
lane
had
one
hundred
and
eight
men
to
remain
with
him
among
whom
was
thomas
hariot
the
celebrated
mathematician
and
historian
with
these
colonists
he
landed
upon
roanoke
island
and
began
to
build
and
fortify
a
town
upon
the
northern
part
of
the
island
which
he
named
the
city
of
raleigh
the
island
is
twelve
miles
long
and
about
four
broad
and
is
to
this
day
fertile
and
pleasant
as
a
place
of
residence
it
then
abounded
in
game
and
countless
and
choice
varieties
of
fish
were
to
be
caught
in
the
sounds
and
sea
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
admiral
grenville
was
active
during
his
stay
at
roanoke
in
visiting
many
indian
towns
and
in
exploring
the
many
broad
waters
that
are
found
connected
with
one
another
in
that
portion
of
north
carolina
on
one
of
his
expeditions
he
lost
a
silver
cup
which
was
stolen
from
him
during
his
stay
at
an
indian
town
the
passionate
seaman
in
a
rage
demanded
its
return
by
the
indians
whom
he
charged
with
stealing
it
they
did
not
comply
and
he
with
great
imprudence
and
injustice
burned
the
whole
village
and
destroyed
all
the
corn
this
was
the
first
taste
afforded
the
indians
of
how
harshly
they
might
expect
to
be
treated
and
though
no
war
followed
immediately
they
neither
forgot
nor
forgave
punishment
and
many
unexpected
injuries
were
inflicted
upon
the
poor
settlers
by
the
indians
on
account
of
this
rash
and
cruel
act
governor
lane
after
the
admiral
departure
continued
his
explorations
in
order
to
learn
the
geography
and
nature
of
the
country
he
ascended
the
chowan
river
to
near
the
mouth
of
the
nottoway
and
penetrated
the
interior
as
far
as
the
indian
village
of
chowanoke
instead
of
clearing
fields
and
making
provisions
for
his
people
he
was
laboriously
searching
for
gold
mines
and
jewels
he
was
told
by
the
chief
of
the
chowanoke
indians
whom
he
held
as
prisoner
for
two
days
that
such
things
abounded
along
the
upper
reaches
of
roanoke
river
then
called
the
moratock
and
that
the
headwaters
of
that
stream
extended
to
within
an
arrow
flight
of
a
great
ocean
to
the
west
and
along
the
banks
of
the
river
lived
a
very
great
and
wealthy
race
of
people
whose
walled
cities
glittered
with
pearls
and
gold
fired
in
imagination
by
this
false
and
wicked
indian
story
preparations
were
made
for
a
journey
in
boats
longer
than
had
yet
been
attempted
they
found
the
swift
current
of
the
roanoke
difficult
to
ascend
and
their
small
store
of
provisions
was
exhausted
by
the
time
they
had
reached
where
the
town
of
williamston
now
stands
they
could
procure
none
from
the
tuscaroras
who
dwelt
upon
the
banks
and
while
in
this
dilemma
the
savages
made
a
night
attack
upon
their
camp
and
with
great
difficulty
the
adventurers
succeeded
in
escaping
destruction
thus
perished
governor
lane
dreams
of
gold
he
hurried
back
to
roanoke
and
soon
found
the
hostility
of
the
tuscaroras
extending
to
the
tribe
under
wingina
granganimeo
was
dead
and
manteo
was
the
only
indian
of
any
influence
who
manifested
friendship
for
the
colonists
they
had
previously
brought
an
abundance
of
fish
game
and
fruits
but
these
supplies
now
ceased
and
governor
lane
realized
that
he
was
surrounded
by
a
people
who
had
become
his
enemies
by
some
means
he
discovered
that
wingina
was
concerting
with
the
tuscaroras
for
an
attack
upon
roanoke
island
concealing
this
knowledge
he
invited
the
unsuspecting
plotter
to
come
with
certain
of
his
people
to
a
feast
at
the
city
of
raleigh
they
accepted
the
invitation
and
wingina
with
eight
of
his
headmen
was
put
to
death
this
occurred
on
the
first
of
june
this
was
a
stern
and
bloody
punishment
of
their
foes
but
it
gave
the
white
men
deliverance
from
attack
until
sir
francis
drake
came
with
a
large
fleet
and
anchored
in
trinity
harbor
finding
the
colony
almost
in
a
perishing
condition
ralph
lane
was
not
a
hero
but
francis
drake
was
if
the
governor
lacked
resolution
no
man
ever
supposed
the
great
admiral
deficient
in
this
respect
after
a
long
consultation
drake
approved
the
resolution
of
the
colonists
to
abandon
the
settlement
and
on
the
of
june
taking
them
aboard
his
ships
he
steered
for
england
leaving
the
city
of
raleigh
untenanted
thus
failed
the
first
attempt
at
forming
a
permanent
settlement
upon
this
great
territory
forming
the
present
limits
of
the
united
states

governor
white
colony
to
it
must
have
been
a
sore
trial
to
sir
walter
raleigh
when
he
learned
that
his
colonists
had
returned
to
england
he
had
sent
over
a
ship
with
abundant
supplies
which
reached
roanoke
only
a
few
days
after
sir
francis
drake
sailed
away
with
his
fleet
finding
no
white
people
upon
the
island
the
ships
returned
to
england
sir
richard
grenville
also
touched
at
the
same
point
with
three
other
ships
about
fifteen
days
later
the
folly
avarice
and
timidity
of
agents
such
as
ralph
lane
have
in
all
ages
crippled
the
noblest
efforts
for
human
advancement
sir
richard
grenville
left
fifteen
men
in
the
fort
built
at
roanoke
by
lane
lest
the
english
claim
to
the
country
should
be
lost
through
want
of
its
being
occupied
they
soon
fell
victims
to
indian
vengeance
after
grenville
had
hoisted
his
sails
and
gone
in
search
of
spanish
treasure
ships
once
again
in
raleigh
collected
a
fleet
of
transports
and
with
john
white
as
governor
sent
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
men
women
and
children
to
roanoke
for
permanent
settlement
they
brought
over
farming
implements
wisely
determining
to
give
up
the
useless
search
for
gold
and
to
look
to
husbandry
as
a
means
of
livelihood
in
their
new
home
on
arriving
at
roanoke
on
the
of
july
governor
white
with
forty
of
his
best
men
went
ashore
for
the
purpose
of
finding
the
men
who
had
been
left
there
by
grenville
the
fort
was
destroyed
the
houses
were
in
a
dilapidated
condition
and
no
trace
of
the
colonists
was
found
except
a
single
skeleton
which
lay
bleaching
in
the
sun
in
front
of
one
of
the
cabins
indicating
that
some
fearful
tragedy
had
been
enacted
sir
walter
raleigh
had
ordered
white
to
go
to
hampton
roads
in
the
region
of
chesapeake
bay
instead
of
roanoke
but
this
command
was
disregarded
under
the
plea
that
their
pilot
a
spaniard
would
not
show
the
way
but
as
governor
lane
had
sent
a
party
there
the
year
before
the
location
must
have
been
known
to
others
of
the
expedition
besides
fernando
the
pilot
it
was
like
everything
else
done
by
john
white
while
connected
with
the
effort
of
colonization
very
foolish
and
culpable
manteo
was
still
the
warm
friend
of
the
english
and
with
his
mother
welcomed
them
to
his
home
on
croatan
he
was
on
the
of
august
as
a
reward
for
his
faithful
services
baptized
by
order
of
sir
walter
raleigh
and
created
a
nobleman
with
the
title
of
lord
of
roanoke
which
was
the
first
title
of
nobility
ever
conferred
by
the
english
in
america
governor
white
had
among
the
colonists
a
daughter
named
eleanor
wife
of
ananias
dare
one
of
his
assistants
on
august
a
few
days
after
their
arrival
she
gave
birth
to
a
little
girl
who
in
honor
of
the
land
of
her
birth
was
named
virginia
dare
this
is
about
all
we
know
of
the
little
girl
who
will
ever
be
famous
as
the
first
of
all
the
children
born
to
english
speaking
people
within
the
borders
of
the
united
states
one
of
the
counties
of
this
state
bears
the
name
of
dare
in
honor
of
this
little
girl
and
includes
in
its
area
the
scene
of
her
birth
governor
white
had
been
at
roanoke
only
a
few
weeks
when
he
became
convinced
that
he
should
at
once
return
to
england
in
the
interest
of
the
people
he
had
been
sent
over
here
to
govern
he
said
they
would
need
provisions
and
additions
to
their
numbers
and
a
larger
supply
of
implements
of
civilized
life
therefore
after
a
stay
of
but
days
with
the
colony
he
set
sail
for
england
he
should
have
manifested
even
more
haste
to
return
to
america
as
members
of
his
own
family
were
included
among
the
settlers
who
were
at
roanoke
looking
to
him
for
guidance
and
safety
amid
so
many
dangers
but
when
he
reached
england
and
raleigh
had
furnished
him
with
two
ships
and
men
and
stores
for
his
speedy
return
john
white
found
excuse
for
long
stay
before
revisiting
the
stormy
neighborhood
of
cape
hatteras
when
he
was
ready
to
sail
for
america
a
great
spanish
fleet
called
the
invincible
armada
was
drawing
near
the
english
coast
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
dethroning
the
queen
and
subjugating
the
people
john
white
preferred
to
take
the
chances
of
plunder
in
the
coming
engagement
to
fulfilling
his
duty
to
the
poor
people
at
roanoke
who
were
waiting
so
anxiously
for
his
return
british
heroism
aided
by
a
severe
storm
drove
off
and
destroyed
the
great
spanish
fleet
and
governor
white
with
his
two
ships
which
raleigh
had
with
great
difficulty
fitted
out
for
him
with
stores
for
the
colony
joined
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitives
he
gained
neither
gold
nor
glory
and
his
ships
were
so
battered
that
they
had
to
be
carried
into
port
and
repaired
before
they
were
fit
to
venture
on
a
voyage
across
the
atlantic
ocean
sir
walter
raleigh
expressed
very
great
displeasure
at
the
conduct
of
governor
white
three
years
had
elapsed
before
governor
white
came
back
to
roanoke
he
found
the
city
of
raleigh
as
desolate
as
upon
his
first
arrival
there
was
no
trace
of
the
colonists
left
except
the
word
croatan
carved
upon
a
tree
it
had
been
agreed
that
if
the
colonists
should
find
it
necessary
to
remove
before
his
return
they
would
thus
designate
the
place
to
which
they
had
gone
governor
white
in
his
search
found
three
of
his
chests
which
had
been
buried
by
the
colonists
and
afterwards
dug
up
and
partly
broken
open
they
contained
books
maps
and
pictures
all
of
which
were
badly
torn
and
spoiled
croatan
was
a
peninsula
about
fifty
miles
from
roanoke
island
and
governor
white
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
people
whom
he
left
had
gone
there
but
he
sailed
down
the
coast
in
sight
of
the
place
and
went
back
to
england
with
no
further
efforts
to
discover
the
nature
of
their
fate
thus
again
roanoke
was
left
to
the
savage
and
the
wild
beast
it
will
never
be
known
what
became
of
the
colonists
sir
walter
raleigh
for
a
long
time
did
not
despair
of
finding
them
and
sent
out
five
expeditions
for
this
purpose
but
all
were
unsuccessful
their
fate
is
one
of
those
sealed
secrets
which
will
only
be
known
when
all
our
ignorance
shall
be
enlightened
and
the
sea
gives
up
its
dead
note
there
was
a
tradition
among
the
indians
that
these
people
after
great
suffering
for
food
were
adopted
by
the
hatteras
tribe
of
indians
and
became
mingled
with
them
and
it
is
said
that
later
generations
of
these
indians
possessed
many
physical
characteristics
which
indicated
a
mixture
of
the
european
and
indian
races

to
the
story
of
the
attempted
settlement
on
roanoke
island
is
the
story
of
one
of
the
world
tragedies
misfortune
seemed
to
be
the
doom
not
only
of
the
colonists
but
of
many
gallant
men
who
sought
to
aid
sir
walter
raleigh
in
his
enterprise
sir
humphrey
gilbert
with
two
of
his
ships
was
the
first
to
perish
at
sea
sir
francis
drake
and
his
compeer
sir
john
hawkins
both
died
of
pestilence
in
the
west
indies
and
to
the
baffled
and
hearted
originator
of
the
scheme
the
coming
years
were
black
with
disaster
and
death
with
the
loss
of
governor
white
colony
raleigh
found
that
his
expenditures
had
greatly
impaired
his
wealth
he
had
lost
more
than
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
sterling
and
no
longer
able
to
fit
out
costly
and
fruitless
expeditions
was
forced
to
solicit
aid
from
others
joining
them
in
the
rights
and
privileges
granted
him
by
the
queen
in
his
charter
note
it
must
also
be
remembered
that
money
in
the
sixteenth
century
was
worth
at
least
five
times
more
than
at
present
forty
thousand
pounds
expended
by
sir
walter
raleigh
would
at
that
time
purchase
about
what
one
million
dollars
would
now
command
in
england
or
the
united
but
raleigh
found
his
greatest
disaster
in
the
death
of
elizabeth
after
ruling
england
so
wisely
and
well
for
more
than
fifty
years
she
died
on
march
this
great
queen
left
her
throne
to
one
of
the
most
paltry
and
contemptible
of
men
king
james
i
was
an
ungainly
scotch
pedant
who
was
incapable
of
appreciating
heroism
and
manliness
in
others
because
of
his
own
deficiency
in
all
such
qualities
he
lavished
favors
and
titles
on
unworthy
favorites
and
incurred
the
contempt
of
wise
men
for
his
follies
and
vices
sir
walter
raleigh
had
long
treated
the
spaniards
as
the
enemies
of
his
country
the
king
of
spain
hated
him
on
that
account
and
king
james
to
please
his
catholic
majesty
and
secure
the
marriage
of
prince
charles
to
a
spanish
princess
caused
the
great
lawyer
sir
edward
coke
to
procure
the
wrongful
conviction
of
raleigh
his
greatest
subject
after
lying
in
prison
for
twelve
years
under
this
conviction
raleigh
was
released
by
king
james
and
although
not
pardoned
was
put
in
command
of
an
expedition
to
the
coast
of
guiana
the
expedition
was
unsuccessful
and
on
his
return
to
satisfy
the
king
of
spain
james
signed
the
warrant
for
raleigh
execution
upon
his
former
sentence
accordingly
raleigh
was
beheaded
at
the
age
of
as
a
traitor
to
the
land
for
whose
good
he
had
accomplished
more
than
any
one
else
in
all
its
limits
note
sir
walter
raleigh
occupied
the
twelve
years
of
his
imprisonment
in
writing
a
history
of
the
world
this
work
gave
great
offence
to
king
james
who
endeavored
to
suppress
its
circulation
when
raleigh
was
carried
to
execution
while
on
the
scaffold
he
asked
to
see
the
axe
he
closely
examined
its
bright
keen
edge
and
said
with
a
smile
this
is
a
sharp
medicine
but
a
sound
cure
for
all
diseases
he
then
laid
his
head
composedly
on
the
block
moved
his
lips
as
if
in
prayer
and
gave
the
signal
for
the
thus
suffered
and
died
the
man
who
first
sent
ships
and
men
to
the
soil
of
north
carolina
that
he
failed
in
what
he
desired
to
accomplish
should
not
detract
from
the
gratitude
and
reverence
due
to
his
memory
if
incompetent
and
unworthy
agents
and
the
accidents
of
fortune
thwarted
him
in
his
designs
the
fault
is
not
his
he
was
the
greatest
and
most
illustrious
man
connected
with
our
annals
as
a
state
and
should
ever
receive
the
applause
and
remembrance
of
our
people
after
the
death
of
sir
walter
raleigh
no
more
efforts
were
made
to
plant
a
colony
at
roanoke
the
spot
was
never
favorable
for
such
a
purpose
no
coast
in
the
world
is
much
more
dangerous
to
ships
than
that
of
north
carolina
cape
hatteras
is
even
now
the
dread
of
all
mariners
it
is
visited

its
deadly
sandbars
for
fifteen
miles
out
into

surprise
and
wreck

grew
more

there
were
hardships

were
persecuted
on

he
too
with
his
bitter
and
envenomed
soul
took

scheme
which
was
to

of

had
been
general
george
monk
before
the

of

charles
and
was
made
a
nobleman
on
account
of
his
part
in
that
transaction
he
was
not
possessed
of
very
great
ability
and
only
became
famous
by
the
accidents
of
fortune
very
different
was
the
astute
lawyer
edward
hyde
who
for
his
abilities
was
made
the
earl
of
clarendon
and
lord
high
chancellor
of
england
he
was
a
selfish
and
crafty
man
and
lost
his
offices
in

old
age

had
two
granddaughters
who
became
queens
of
great
britain
lord
ashley
afterward
the
earl

will
ever
be
remembered
for
the
part
he
bore
in
establishing
the
writ
of
habeas

as
a
part
of
the
british
constitution
he
was
a
bold
able
and
profligate
man
who
marred
great
abilities
by
greater
vices
he
combined
within
himself
all
that
is
dangerous
and
detestable
in
a
demagogue
sir
william
berkeley
then
governor
of
the
province
of
virginia
was
another
of
these
lords
proprietors
he
was
the
embodiment
of
the
cruelty
and
religious
prejudice
of
that
age
he
whipped
and
imprisoned
people
who
worshipped
god
in
a
way
not
pleasing
to
himself
and
was
immortalized
by
the
remark
of
king
charles
who
said
of
him
that
old
fool
has
taken
more
lives
without
offence
in
that
naked
country
than
i
in
all
england
for
the
murder
of
my
father
to
these
men
as
lords
proprietors
a
great
territory
was
granted
which
they
called
carolina
in
compliment
to
king
charles
ii
many
years
before

the
name
of

had
been
applied

in

of

charles
ix
of
all
of
them
except
governor
berkeley
lived
in
england
but
they
ruled
the
new
country
and
sold
the
lands
at
the
highest
rate
of
money
they
could
get
with
a
tax
of
cents
on
each
hundred
acres
to
be
paid
every
year
many
fine
promises
were
made
to
the
english
and
other
people
to
induce
them
to
go
to
carolina
and
settle
freedom
to
worship
god
in
the
way
that
seemed
best
to
each
individual
was
especially
held
out
to
poor
sufferers
like
john
bunyan
who
in
those
days
were
too
often
kept
for
long
years
in
loathsome
prisons
because
of
their
differing
with
the
civil
magistrates
as
to
certain
matters
of
faith
and
practice
in
the
churches
note
governor
berkeley
exhibited
some
traits
of
his
character
by
saying
while
governor
of

i
thank
god
there
are
no
free
schools
nor
printing
here
and
i
hope
we
shall
have
none
of
them
these
hundred
years
religious
persecutions
were
practiced
in
most
of
the
american
colonies
it
had
been
decreed
in
some
of
the
new
england
colonies
that
quakers
upon
coming
into
the
province
should
have
their
tongues
bored
with
a
hot
iron
and
be
banished
any
person
bringing
a
quaker
into
the
province
was
fined
one
hundred
pounds
sterling
about
five
hundred
dollars
and
the
quaker
was
given
twenty
lashes
and
imprisoned
at
hard
labor
in
virginia
the
persecutions
were
equally
as
bad
if
not
worse
and
some
of
the
punishments
were
almost
as
severe
as
indian
tortures
the
assembly
of
this
colony
virginia
levied
upon
all
quakers
a
monthly
tax
of
one
hundred
dollars
to
escape
persecution
many
men
who
were
quakers
and
baptists
had
already
gone
to
the
region
around
the
albemarle
sound
and
others
followed
from
various
inducements
their
settlements
were
known
as
the
albemarle
colony
the
whole
country
was
still
roamed
over
by
indians
and
even
in
albemarle
the
rude
farmhouses
were
widely
scattered
there
was
not
even
a

no
churches
courthouses
or

schools
were
to
be

the

loved

they
preferred
to
undergo
danger
from
the
indians
and
the
privations

lonely
homes
in

to
the
persecution
which
they
found
in

was
a
man
who
deserved

confidence
of
the
people
whom
he
governed
he
was
plain

prudent
in

capture
the
entire

was
confiscated
and

governor
drummond
is
commemorated
by
the
lake
in
the
dismal
swamp
which
still
bears
his
name
it
was
discovered
soon
after
the
king
grant
to
the
lords
proprietors
that
a
belt
of
land
extending
southward
from
the
present
virginia
boundary
to
a
point
on
a
line
with
the
month
of
chowan
river
and
extending
indefinitely
west
was
not
included
in
that
charter
so
in
another
charter
was
granted
joining
this
strip
of
territory
to
north
carolina
in
there
was
an
expedition
formed
in
the
island
of
barbadoes
which
came
to
the
shores
of
carolina
and
explored
to
the
distance
of
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
the
courses
of
the
northeast
branch
of
the
cape
fear
river
this
expedition
was
under
command
of
an
experienced
navigator
named
hilton
who
was
assisted
by
long
and
fabian
and
returned
to
barbadoes
in
february
among
the
planters
who
had
fitted
out
this
expedition
was
john
yeamans
he
was
a
young
man
of
good
connections
in
england
his
father
had
been
sheriff
of
the
city
of
bristol
during
the
war
of
king
charles
with
parliament
and
was
put
to
death
by
the
order
of
fairfax
on
account
of
his
stubborn
defence
of
his
city
in
the
king
behalf
yeamans
had
emigrated
to
barbadoes
hoping
to
mend
his
broken
fortunes
and
being
pleased
with
the
report
of
captain
expedition
he
determined
to
remove
to
carolina
he
went
to
england
to
negotiate
with
the
lords
proprietors
and
receive
from
them
a
grant
of
large
tracts
of
land
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
knighted
by
the
king
in
reward
for
the
loyalty
and
misfortunes
of
his
family
returning
from
england
in
the
autumn
of
he
led
a
band
of
colonists
from
barbadoes
to
the
cape
fear
and
purchasing
from
the
indians
a
tract
of
land
miles
square
settled
at
old
town
in
the
present
county
of
brunswick
the
settlement
was
afterwards
known
as
the
clarendon
colony
this
village
which
was
called
charlestown
soon
came
to
number
eight
hundred
inhabitants
and
they
occupied
their
time
in
clearing
the
land
for
cultivation
and
preparing
lumber
staves
hoops
and
shingles
for
shipment
to
barbadoes
the
colony
greatly
prospered
under
the
excellent
and
prudent
management
of
sir
john
yeamans
but
was
afterwards
deserted
when
yeamans
was
ordered
by
the
lords
proprietors
to
the
government
of
a
colony
on
cooper
and
ashley
rivers
south
carolina
there
had
been
as
early
as
a
new
england
settlement
for
the
purpose
of
raising
cattle
on
the
cape
fear
but
this
colony
incurred
the
resentment
of
the
indians
it
is
said
by
kidnapping
their
children
under
the
pretence
of
sending
them
to
boston
to
be
educated
and
the
colonists
were
all
gone
when
the
men
from
barbadoes
visited
the
cape
fear
whether
the
new
englanders
were
driven
from
the
settlement
by
the
indians
or
left
because
their
enterprise
was
unprofitable
is
not
known
with
certainty
these
men
left
attached
to
a
post
a
writing
discouraging
all
such
as
should
hereafter
come
into
these
parts
to
settle
during
governor
drummond
stay
in
albemarle
there
was
entire
satisfaction
manifested
by
the
people
with
his
rule
and
also
with
that
of
the
lords
proprietors
he
exerted
himself
to
arrange
matters
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
titles
acquired
in
the
time
previous
to
the
king
grant
and
there
was
full
sympathy
between
him
and
the
class
represented
by
george
durant
this
sturdy
quaker
had
some
years
before
bought
from
the
yeoppim
indians
the
place
known
as
durant
neck
on
perquimans
river
and
he
was
a
leader
in
wealth
and
influence
among
the
settlers
he
was
prosperous
in
his
affairs
and
largely
controlled
the
views
of
the
people
belonging
to
his
religious
sect
the
rivers
were
full
of
fish
every
spring
and
with
little
trouble
large
supplies
were
caught
in
the
nets
and
weirs
indian
corn
tobacco
and
lumber
were
sent
in
vessels
to
new
england
and
the
west
indies
in
return
sugar
coffee
and
rum
were
brought
to
albemarle
and
an
active
trade
grew
up
which
was
almost
wholly
conducted
by
the
new
england
vessels
these
vessels
all
passed
through
the
inlet
at
nag
head
where
as
late
as
feet
of
water
was
found
upon
the
bar
this
afforded
entrance
to
ships
of
considerable
size
cape
hatteras
was
then
as
now
a
place
of
great
peril
to
ships
and
many
were
wrecked
upon
the
terrible
outlying
sand
bars
but
this
did
not

after

berkeley
had
put
governor
drummond
to
death
in
the
manner
described
governor
stephens
was
sent
in
to
take
his
place
stephens
was
a
ruler
of
ordinary
abilities
and
probably
did
his
best
for
the
interests
of
the
province
so
far
as
was
consistent
with
a
keen
regard
for
instructions
from
the
lords
proprietors
the
government
in
his
day
consisted
of
the
governor
his
council
of
twelve
and
twelve
members
of
the
house
of
assembly
elected
by
the
freeholders
every
white
man
having
an
estate
of
inheritance
or
for
life
in
fifty
acres
of
land
was
a
freeholder
perfect
religious
liberty
was
allowed
and
there
was
no
check
at
that
day
upon
the
government
provided
it
preserved
its
fealty
to
the
king
and
the
lords
proprietors
a
wide
margin
was
left
to
the
grand
assembly
of
albemarle
for
the
display
of
its
power
neither
the
legislature
nor
the
governor
had
any
capital
city
for
the
transaction
of
business
the
governor
lived
on
any
farm
he
pleased
and
the
general
assembly
met
at
such
place
as
it
deemed
most
convenient
their
earliest
known
legislation
allowed
no
settlers
to
be
disturbed
for
the
collection
of
debts
contracted
before
coming
to
live
in
albemarle
another
law
exempted
all
newcomers
from
taxes
for
one
year
and
prohibited
the
transfer
of
any
land
by
a
settler
during
the
first
two
years
of
his
residence
these
laws
were
evidently
passed
to
encourage
immigration
as
there
were
no
church
of
england
preachers
then
in
the
colony
another
statute
allowed
people
to
get
married
by
simply
going
before
the
governor
or
any
of
his
council
and
declaring
a
purpose
to
become
man
and
wife
albemarle
at
that
time
was
divided
into
the
precincts
of
carteret
berkeley
and
shaftesbury
the
settlements
extended
rapidly
down
the
seacoast
and
soon
reached
as
far
south
as
the
present
town
of
beaufort
on
old
topsail
inlet
governor
stephens
soon
reached
the
conclusion
of
his
administration
and
the
term
of
his
natural
life
the
closing
months
of
his
rule
were
embittered
by
the
nature
of
the
instructions
he
received
from
the
lords
proprietors
and
the
board
of
trade
in
london
one
of
these
instructions
materially
changing
the
simple
government
previously
existing
in
the
province
was
concerning
the
colonial
trade
english
merchants
saw
that
new
england
vessels
were
visiting
the
scattered
settlements
on
the
watercourses
and
establishing
a
lucrative
exchange
of
manufactured
goods
for
the
tobacco
corn
and
lumber
of
carolina
it
was
determined
in
london
to
stop
this
and
appropriate
to
english
factors
whatever
of
profit
might
be
realized
the
old
english
navigation
act
passed
under
cromwell
to
break
down
the
dutch
trade
was
revived
against
the
boston
skippers
governor
stephens
accordingly
told
the
colonists
they
must
exchange
the
products
of
their
farms
with
none
but
english
traders
but
he
quickly
found
that
the
people
were
resolute
in
refusing
obedience
to
any
such
regulations
it
was
further
announced
that
a
new
scheme
of
rule
had
been
prepared
in
england
this
was
the
work
of
lord
shaftesbury
and
a
distinguished
philosopher
named
john
locke
this
familiarly
known
as
locke
grand
model
was
called
by
the
proprietors
the
fundamental
constitutions
of
carolina
and
was
a
cumbrous
and
elaborate
system
full
of
titles
and
dignities
it
involved
a
large
expenditure
and
was
as
unsuited
to
the
carolina
wilderness
as
paul
cathedral
in
london
was
for
a
meetinghouse
for
the
quakers
of
pasquotank
the
people
who
were
constantly
enduring
danger
and
privations
in
albemarle
at
once
resolved
that
they
would
have
no
part
in
the
titles
and
pageants
concocted
by
these
wise
men
of
england
they
had
been
promised
freedom
if
they
would
come
to
america
both
by
the
king
in
the
great
deed
of
grant
and
by
the
lords
proprietors
and
nothing
less
than
the
privileges
of
englishmen
would
satisfy
them
the
navigation
act
was
intended
to
destroy
their
commerce
and
manufactures
and
the
fundamental
constitutions
if
submitted
to
would
have
put
an
end
to
their
home
rule
they
waged
a
long
opposition
to
these
two
things
and
a
century
went
by
before
in
the
blood
of
the
revolution
american
commerce
became
free
they
were
denounced
as
unruly
subjects
but
they
were
in
all
truth
wise
and
resolute
patriots
they
were
protecting
not
only
themselves
but
the
generations
of
the
future
questions
who
succeeded

drummond
as
governor
of
albemarle
what
kind

xiii
early
governors
and
their
troubles
to
samuel
stephens
upon
his
death
in
was
succeeded
by
george
carteret
as
governor
of
albemarle
the
oldest
member
of
the
council
was
entitled
by
law
to
the
place
but
the
members
of
the
house
of
assembly
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
position
for
their
speaker
governor
carteret
found
many
difficulties
in
the
office
he
had
assumed
and
becoming
disgusted
with
the
continued
opposition
of
the
people
to
the
fundamental
constitutions
and
the
navigation
laws
of
he
went
over
to
london
and
resigned
his
place
as
governor
when
he
reached
england
he
found
eastchurch
who
as
speaker
of
the
house
of
assembly
had
been
sent
over
to
remonstrate
with
the
proprietors
against
the
innovations
they
were
proposing
his
friend
miller
who
was
accused
of
indulging
in
rebellious
language
had
been
carried
out
of
the
province
for
trial
at
williamsburg
in
virginia
and
was
also
in
london
at
this
time
seeking
redress
for
his
alleged
grievances
eastchurch
was
in
london
as
the
agent
for
albemarle
the
people
were
paying
him
to
procure
the
assent
of
the
proprietors
to
some
remission
in
the
hard
measure
of
the
navigation
laws
also
for
the
abrogation
of
the
fundamental
constitutions
he
and
miller
betrayed
their
trusts
and
became
the
willing
tools
of
lord
shaftesbury
and
the
board
of
trade
as
the
price
of
their
subservience
eastchurch
was
appointed
governor
of
albemarle
and
miller
was
made
secretary
of
state
the
authorities
in
london
were
fully
resolved
that
the
new
england
vessels
should
be
excluded
from
carolina
waters
and
that
the
fundamental
constitutions
should
be
accepted
as
the
system
of
government
this
betrayal
of
a
high
trust
was
to
bring
its
own
punishment
on
the
heads
of
both
eastchurch
and
miller
on
their
way
to
america
they
stopped
at
the
island
of
nevis
where
the
new
governor
of
albemarle
met
a
creole
lady
his
conduct
in
london
had
been
weak
enough
but
complete
insanity
seemed
to
have
fallen
upon
him
at
nevis
for
two
years
he
was
oblivious
to
all
the
disorders
and
distresses
of
the
people
committed
to
his
government
and
he
surrendered
everything
else
to
his
lovemaking
miller
went
on
to
albemarle
and
in
july
assumed
control
of
public
affairs
there
were
then
in
the
colony
two
thousand
taxpayers
besides
indian
corn
which
was
the
staple
production
eight
hundred
thousand
pounds
of
tobacco
were
made
that
year
the
whole
colony
was
enjoying
such
prosperity
as
a
fertile
soil
and
good
climate
always
give
the
new
governor
conducted
matters
in
an
outrageous
manner
he
imposed
taxes
upon
all
goods
sent
to
other
colonies
and
in
this
way
soon
realized
five
thousand
dollars
on
the
tobacco
which
was
sent
to
virginia
and
boston
he
was
particularly
emphatic
in
his
orders
forbidding
trade
with
new
england
vessels
george
durant
with
a
large
majority
of
the
people
was
determined
to
thwart
him
in
this
matter
governor
miller
on
the
other
hand
was
so
determined
in
enforcing
his
orders
that
he
in
person
boarded
a
boston
vessel
and
arrested
the
skipper
thereupon
john
culpepper
with
his
followers
seized
miller
and
having
put
him
in
prison
assumed
the
government
himself
he
imprisoned
all
the
deputies
of
the
lords
proprietors
the
revenue
also
amounting
to
fifteen
thousand
dollars
was
appropriated
by
him
culpepper
like
gillam
the
skipper
who
had
caused
the
outbreak
was
from
new
england
at
last
after
two
years
delay
upon
his
journey
eastchurch
made
his
appearance
in
albemarle
he
had
won
his
bride
but
lost
everything
else
culpepper
scouted
his
claims
to
the
government
he
went
to
williamsburg
in
virginia
to
beg
the
governor
of
that
province
to
aid
him
in
regaining
the
place
he
had
lost
by
his
folly
but
so
slow
and
ceremonious
was
his
lordship
that
eastchurch
died
of
vexation
before
anything
substantial
had
been
accomplished
in
his
behalf
miller
escaped
from
the
confinement
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
by
culpepper
and
again
went
to
england
to
utter
his
complaints
culpepper
followed
him
there
and
though
indicted
and
tried
for
treason
was
acquitted
by
aid
of
lord
shaftesbury
thus
it
was
in
the
earliest
days
of
our
history
as
a
people
that
the
men
of
north
carolina
found
means
to
resist
the
execution
of
laws
enacted
abroad
for
their
oppression
and
commenced
a
struggle
which
was
to
continue
for
a
century
questions
who
succeeded
samuel
stephens
as
governor
how
did
he
obtain
the
place
why
did
governor
carteret
go
to
england
what
two
men
from
carolina
did
he
find
in
england
and
what
was
their
mission
what
duty
had
the
colonists
entrusted
to
eastchurch
how
did
he
fulfill
the
trust
how
were
eastchurch
and

rewarded
for
their
betrayal

was
the

of
the
london
authorities
what
was
the
conduct

on
his
way
to

do
in

meantime

the
condition

at

period

chapter
xiv
lord
carteret
adds
a
new
trouble
to
when
john
culpepper
had
ended
his
administration
the
authorities
in
england
sent
over
john
harvey
as
governor
little
is
known
of
him
or
of
his
successors
john
jenkins
and
henry
wilkinson
there
were
still
misrule
and
confusion
in
albemarle
a
few
men
of
wealth
who
acted
as
deputies
in
the
council
for
the
absent
lords
proprietors
were
their
advocates
and
defenders
in
everything
they
proposed
but
the
people
still
traded
with
new
england
vessels
and
vented
their
scorn
upon
the
fundamental
constitutions
at
last
in
the
authorities
in
england
concluded
that
if
one
of
their
own
number
went
over
he
might
exert
more
influence
upon
the
people
than
a
hired
agent
therefore
they
induced
seth
sothel
who
had
bought
the
interest
first
granted
to
the
earl
of
clarendon
to
venture
on
the
doubtful
expedient
to
the
great
good
fortune
of
the
province
this
abandoned
man
was
captured
at
sea
by
algerine
pirates
thus
he
became
the
slave
of
these
corsairs
for
two
years
when
he
arrived
it
was
soon
seen
what
a
beastly
and
detestable
monster
had
been
sent
as
a
reformer
of
the
morals
of
the
people
of
albemarle
he
was
the
most
shameless
reprobate
ever
seen
as
a
governor
in
america
he
took
bribes
stole
property
and
appropriated
the
indian
trade
to
his
own
uses
growing
worse
and
worse
until
the
people
in
could
no
longer
endure
his
iniquities
and
drove
him
from
the
place
he
disgraced
he
went
to
south
carolina
and
after
his
sentence
to
twelve
months
exile
had
expired
returned
to
north
carolina
and
died
in
philip
ludwell
and
alexander
lillington
were
the
next
rulers
in
north
carolina
and
the
administration
of
the
latter
witnessed
the
triumph
of
the
colonists
in
the
consent
of
the
lords
proprietors
to
the
abolition
of
the
fundamental
constitutions
this
event
occurred
in
and
brought
no
little
joy
to
the
men
who
had
so
long
and
successfully
opposed
it
as
the
constitution
of
north
carolina
thomas
harvey
ruled
next
in
albemarle
while
john
archdale
a
wise
and
benevolent
quaker
was
put
in
charge
of
all
the
settlements
in
what
was
north
carolina
and
also
those
on
cooper
and
ashley
rivers
in
south
carolina
in
the
year
a
severe
pestilential
fever
visited
all
the
tribes
of
indians
along
pamlico
sound
and
destroyed
nearly
all
of
them
the
colonists
soon
after
this
feeling
somewhat
safer
from
indian
attacks
began
to
form
settlements
southward
henderson
walker
succeeded
to
the
rule
by
virtue
of
his
place
as
president
of
the
council
after
him
colonel
robert
daniel
who
had
made
reputation
in
an
expedition
against
the
spaniards
in
florida
became
in
the
governor
of
the
province
governor
daniel
was
probably
the
mistaken
and
ignorant
agent
of
lord
carteret
who
happened
then
to
be
the
palatine
or
chief
of
the
lords
proprietors
in
a
foolish
effort
at
reform
carteret
like
james
was
by
no
means
a
pattern
in
morality
but
became
impressed
with
his
duty
to
cause
the
assembly
to
pass
a
law
making
the
episcopal
church
the
state
church
in
the
province
as
it
was
in
england
the
baptists
and
quakers
were
numerous
and
both
of
these
sects
were
sternly
opposed
to
any
such
regulation
the
law
was
passed
in
spite
of
their
votes
to
the
contrary
and
provided
for
building
churches
buying
glebe
lands
and
public
taxation
to
pay
the
rectors
salaries
but
did
not
visit
any
disqualification
or
punishment
upon
nonconformists
the
first
episcopal
preacher
arrived
at
albemarle
in
and
the
first
church
was
built
in
in
chowan
county
these
persons
who
were
not
members
of
the
episcopal
church
said
they
were
already
paying
for
the
support
of
their
pastors
and
at
once
declared
that
they
would
not
submit
to
the
injustice
of
paying
money
to
men
who
were
the
leaders
in
the
persecutions
of
baptists
and
quakers
in
england
and
america
the
presbyterians
of
south
carolina
sent
john
ashe
of
that
section
to
london
to
resist
the
confirmation
of
the
law
and
edmund
porter
was
sent
for
the
same
purpose
by
the
people
of
albemarle
ashe
died
in
london
before
he
knew
of
his
success
both
queen
anne
and
the
house
of
lords
denounced
the
innovation
as
unjust
and
impolitic
and
the
law
was
therefore
annulled
by
her
majesty
in
her
privy
council
it
was
thus
year
by
year
that
the
carolinians
kept
up
their
struggle
for
freedom
and
equality
before
the
law
the
ocean
stretched
between
them
and
the
men
who
sought
their
oppression
and
large
expenditures
both
in
money
and
heartwearing
efforts
were
undergone
as
the
dangerous
and
alarming
years
went
by
but
these
men
of
the
woods
never
wavered
in
their
determination
to
be
free
questions

was
sent
from
england
to
succeed
john
culpepper
as

chapter
xv
thomas
carey
and
the
tuscarora
war
to
thomas
carey
who
had
already
reached
the
positions
of
speaker
of
the
house
of
assembly
and
was
promoted
to
be
governor
in
he
had
been
a
leader
in
opposition
to
governor
daniel
church
scheme
and
for
that
reason
john
archdale
and
the
quakers
had
procured
his
elevation
to
the
latter
position
it
may
be
imagined
what
was
their
disgust
and
surprise
when
it
was
found
that
carey
had
changed
sides
and
become
the
willing
tool
of
lord
carteret
in
the
town
of
bath
in
beaufort
county
was
settled
and
this
was
the
first
incorporated
town
in
north
carolina
one
of
the
oldest
churches
in
the
state
is
at
bath
the
bricks
used
in
the
building
were
brought
from
england
the
edifice
is
still
in
a
good
condition
and
is
regularly
used
for
public
worship
when
the
general
assembly
met
governor
carey
announced
that
under
english
laws
none
but
members
of
the
english
or
episcopal
church
could
be
allowed
to
take
the
oaths
necessary
to
qualification
for
a
seat
in
either
house
john
porter
was
thereupon
sent
to
london
to
make
known
this
fresh
outrage
and
betrayal
of
the
people
he
was
soon
back
with
orders
for
carey
removal
and
the
general
assembly
elected
william
glover
by
the
votes
of
john
porter
and
the
men
he
influenced
it
is
sickening
to
add
that
glover
also
immediately
deceived
the
men
who
were
his
supporters
and
was
found
acting
and
talking
exactly
as
carey
had
done
the
next
thing
seen
was
the
pacification
of
carey
and
the
quakers
and
their
of
him
as
governor
two
rival
governments
were
thus
at
open
rupture
each
claiming
to
be
the
local
government
in
albemarle
they
both
took
up
arms
and
it
seemed
that
bloodshed
must
ensue
a
general
assembly
was
called
to
decide
the
question
of
authority
members
were
present
with
certificates
of
election
signed
by
glover
and
another
set
whose
certificates
were
issued
by
carey
glover
and
carey
with
their
adherents
occupied
separate
rooms
in
the
same
building
and
great
confusion
and
bitterness
prevailed
finally
the
members
of
glover
council
were
compelled
to
seek
refuge
in
virginia
in
such
a
state
of
affairs
edward
hyde
arrived
from
england
with
papers
directing
edward
tynte
the
governor
of
both
south
and
north
carolina
to
commission
him
as
governor
of
north
carolina
in
the
meantime
carey
having
heard
of
governor
tynte
death
refused
to
acknowledge
hyde
claims
and
proceeded
to
arm
and
equip
his
followers
the
cruel
and
crafty
tuscaroras
now
resolved
to
avail
themselves
of
the
divisions
among
the
white
people
they
procured
the
meherrins
corees
mattarnuskeets
and
other
tribes
to
unite
with
them
in
an
effort
to
murder
all
they
could
of
the
settlers
they
kept
the
secret
so
well
that
on
the
night
of
the
of
september
according
to
the
calendar
of
that
day
more
than
two
hundred
whites
were
butchered
the
tuscaroras
mustered
in
their
ranks
a
strong
force
which
was
increased
by
their
allies
to
sixteen
hundred
warriors
the
indians
continued
this
terrible
slaughter
for
three
days
and
only
ceased
when
fatigue
and
drunkenness
rendered
them
incapable
of
further
continuance
the
baron
de
graffenreid
a
nobleman
from
bern
had
just
established
in
a
flourishing
colony
comprising
about
six
hundred
persons
germans
and
swedes
at
new
bern
at
the
confluence
of
the
neuse
and
trent
rivers
de
graffenreid
and
john
lawson
the
while
on
an
exploring
voyage
up
the
neuse
river
a
few
days
before
the
massacre
of
september
were
seized
by
the
indians
the
war
council
decided
that
both
the
men
should
be
put
to
death
de
graffenreid
made
claim
that
he
was
king
of
the
swiss
settlement
just
established
and
escaped
death
by
promising
that
no
more
land
should
he
taken
from
the
indians
without
their
consent
the
unfortunate
lawson
and
a
negro
servant
were
put
to
death
by
the
most
horrible
cruelties
baron
de
graffenreid
was
held
a
captive
for
several
weeks
and
was
set
at
liberty
upon
application
of
governor
spottswood
on
his
return
to
his
settlement
he
found
it
in
a
condition
of
almost
desolation
he
became
so
disheartened
at
the
prospect
that
he
soon
sold
his
interest
in
carolina
and
returned
to
switzerland
the
south
carolina
militia
and
near
a
thousand
yemassee
indians
under
colonel
john
barnwell
came
as
swiftly
as
they
could
to
the
rescue
and
inflicted
a
stunning
blow
upon
the
savages
they
were
attacked
in
a
fort
near
new
bern
and
more
than
three
hundred
of
the
indians
were
killed
and
a
hundred
made
prisoners
thinking
the
league
crushed
colonel
barnwell
went
home
with
his
forces
after
making
a
treaty
with
the
indians
which
was
quickly
broken
in
this
terrible
emergency
which
threatened
the
destruction
of
so
many
settlers
governor
spottswood
of
virginia
did
nothing
to
aid
the
colony
except
keep
the
five
nations
and
tom
blount
tuscaroras
neutral
in
the
war
the
great
danger
was
in
the
possible
adhesion
of
the
new
york
iroquois
to
the
savage
league
with
albemarle
divided
and
consequently
in
a
measure
helpless
it
was
seen
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
meet
the
five
nations
in
battle
when
the
next
spring
had
opened
some
hundreds
of
men
in
north
carolina
were
joined
by
colonel
james
moore
from
south
carolina
with
another
force
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
of
his
white
neighbors
and
the
yemassees
who
again
were
willing
to
make
war
upon
their
hated
enemies
the
tuscaroras
another
bloody
attack
upon
a
fort
made
of
earthworks
and
palisades
resulted
in
such
slaughter
of
the
indians
that
handcock
their
chief
who
had
boldly
led
them
before
was
so
disheartened
at
the
loss
of
his
braves
that
with
his
tribe
he
abandoned
carolina
and
rejoined
his
brethren
in
the
lake
country
of
new
york
who
were
from
that
time
known
as
the
six
nations
they
ventured
no
more
among
the
men
who
had
so
fearfully
broken
their
strength
and
power
as
belligerents

fort
occupied
by

differed
with
governor
eden
in
many
matters
of
provincial
policy
through
all
his
life
as
a
public
man
he
was
intensely
devoted
to
the
interest
of
the
colony
and
though
warmly
attached
to
the
english
or
episcopal
church
was
resolute
in
his
advocacy
of
complete
religious
liberty
he
formed
a
strong
party
of
men
who
regarded
the
governor
as
simply
the
agent
of
the
lords
proprietors
and
therefore
to
be
vigilantly
watched
and
checked
in
any
innovation
upon
established
privileges
there
had
been
for
years
many
crimes
committed
by
pirates
upon
the
ocean
just
along
the
north
carolina
coast
they
sometimes
extended
their
infamous
practices
to
the

rivers

of

largest
of
which
was
called
queen
anne
revenge
this
formidable
craft
carried
a
crew
of
one
hundred
men
and
forty
cannon
edward
moseley
and
others
were
clamorous
for
the
arrest
and
punishment
of
such
horrid
offenders
against
the
law
and
denounced
governor
eden
as
their
accomplice
it
was
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
capt
ellis
brand
who
came
in

of
a

in

was
ordered
to
go
to
that
point
and
capture
the
outlaws
he
found
the
pirates
who
saluted
him
with
so
deadly
a
broadside
that
a
large
portion
of
the
royal
men
were
slain
maynard
unfortunately
got
his
ship
aground
in
the
action
and
his
deck
was
terribly
raked
by
his
antagonists
fire
his
case
seemed
well
nigh
hopeless
when
he
resorted
to
a
stratagem
all
of
his
men
were
ordered
to
go
below
and
soon
the
pirates
saw
nothing
but
dead
men
upon
the
deck
they
hastened
to
board
what
they
thought
was
another
prize
but
maynard
and
his
men
met
them
as
they
crowded
upon
the
deck
and
after
a
bloody
struggle
captured
nine
men
who
were
the
survivors
of
the
prolonged
and
desperate
conflict
among
these
was
a
gigantic
negro
who
was
on
the
point
of
blowing
up
the
pirate
vessel
when
arrested
in

desperate
purpose
was
slain
during

battle
and
maynard
sailed
away
from
the

of
his
victory
with
the

head
fixed
upon

bowsprit
the

there

they

numbers

made
expeditions
in

they
laid

endangered

were

cruel
desperadoes

and
was
succeeded
by

that

was
erected

court
houses
were
for
the

the

as

had
so
long
cursed
with
their
misrule
sent
over
george

the
representative
of
the
lords
proprietors
was
called
governor
of
north

governor
burrington
character
was
very
bad
he
had
been
indicted
and
punished
in
the
old
bailey
in
london
for
beating
an
old
woman
and
was
all
his
life
drunken
and
quarrelsome
yet
such
a
man
came
over
to
be
the
guardian
of
a
people
who
knew
not
when
they
were
to
be
tomahawked
by
the
savages
or
driven
into
further
exile
by
the
zealots
who
were
disturbed
at
the
nature
of
their
religious
belief
this
weak
and
wicked
ruler
only
remained
one
year
in
charge
when
sir
richard
everhard
came
to
replace
him
they
were
brothers
in
iniquity
and
before
burrington
left
edenton
these
two
men
disgraced
themselves
by
fighting
in
the
streets
of
that
village
the
general
assembly
met
at
edenton
and
by
enactment
of
law
the
dividing
line
between
north
carolina
and
virginia
was
run
in
november
of
this
year
such
rulers
as
have
just
been
mentioned
so
utterly
disgusted
every
one
in
the
colony
that
the
king
and
parliament
were
petitioned
to
buy
the
province
and
abolish
the
rule
of
those
who
had
only
hindered
its
growth
so
in
for
the
sum
of
five
thousand
dollars
all
of
the
proprietors
except
lord
carteret
sold
to
the
crown
their
interest
in
carolina
thus
after
years
of
unbounded
misrule
these
men
in
london
who
had
so
greatly
cursed
north
carolina
by
their
ignorance
and
mistakes
surrendered
their
title
to
property
which
had
never
paid
them
more
than
about
one
hundred
dollars
a
piece
in
any
one
year
they
had
never
really
cared
for
the
people
whom
they
were
so
anxious
to
disturb
with
their
crude
notions
of
religion
the
schemes
of
london
merchants
were
of
far
more
moment
thanthe
welfare
of
albemarle
and
the
folly
of
the
fundamental
constitutions
was
to
be
upheld
even
at
the
ruin
of
the
province
as
an
earnest
of
the
want
of
care
king
george
was
to
exhibit
towards
the
colony
governor
burrington
was
sent
back
to
the
people
who
were
already
so
well
acquainted
with
his
faults
of
temper
and
character
he
soon
got
into
trouble
with
the
leading
men
of
the
province
and
pretending
to
go
to
south
carolina
returned
to
england
where
he
was

prove
the
wisest
and
best
of
all
the
men
sent
over
to
rule
the
people
in

he
married
penelope
eden
daughter
of
the
late

and
dwelt
at
her
home
on

were
no

stickler
for

carry
some
dispute
into

but
the
measures
of
governor
johnston
as
a
general
thing
were
pleasing
to
all
classes
of
the
people
and
received
their
support
at
this
period
john
brickell

a
party

was
still
much
trouble

were
pirates
who
chiefly
infested
the
west
indies
where
they
were
sometimes
congregated
by
thousands
at
a
single
place
they
were
daring
enough
to
invade
cities
and
countries
and
caused
great
terror
and
danger
to
all
honest
people
within
their
reach
in
a
fleet
of
the
pirates
under
the
pretext
of
a
war
between
england

sailed
into
the
mouth
of
the

they
were
bravely
met
by
the
people
as
the
fleet
lay
off

the
first
movements
toward
peopling
the
western
sections

who
was
in
command
of
all
the
forces
died
and
governor
dinwiddie
appointed
colonel
innes
his
successor
but
this
appointment
gave
offence
to
the
virginians
who
wished
colonel
george
washington
already
a
favorite
of
the
people
to
take
command
the
virginia
legislature
under
the
circumstances
would
make
no

for
the
support
of

and
it
was
forced
to
return
home
in
this
way
the
generous
purpose
of
north
carolina
was
completely
thwarted
colonel
innes
died
at
winchester
soon
after
the
french
occupied
their
fort
and
perfected
those
arrangements
which
resulted
shortly
afterwards
in

terrible
defeat

carolinians
about
thirty
years
after
these
occurrences
was
assembled
to
attack
colonel
patrick
ferguson
british
and
tories
at
king
mountain
a
very
different
spirit
prevailed
there
the
north
carolina
officers
who
greatly
outnumbered
those
of
the
old
dominion
insisted
that
as
they
were
at
home
colonel
campbell
of
the
latter
state
should
assume
command
and
their
knightly
courtesy
was
followed
by

chapter
xix
governor
arthur
dobbs
to
king
george
selected
major
arthur
dobbs
as
governor
of
north
carolina
and
at
new
bern
on
november
he
entered
upon
the
discharge
of
his
duties
he
was
a
man
of
high
temper
and
very
obstinate
in
support
of
his
views
but
devoted
to
whatever
he
believed
his
duty
demanded
his
greatest
fault
was
filling
public
offices
with
members
of
his
own
family
and
a
disposition
to
make
jobs
for
his
own
benefit
governor
dobbs
soon
visited
the
new
county
of
rowan
which
was
established
in
and
included
in
its
area
most
of
the
western
portion
of
north
carolina
and
a
part
of
tennessee
he
found
presbyterians
under
rev
hugh
mcaden
and
baptists
under
rev
shubal
stearns
establishing
churches
and
laying
the
foundations
of
towns
in
a
region
where
but
a
few
years
before
no
white
people
were
to
be
seen
colonel
hugh
waddell
of
brunswick
was
put
in
command
of
troops
raised
in
north
carolina
for
the
french
and
indian
war
he
had
started
to
join
general
braddock
column
but
just
previous
to
the
fatal
battle
on
monongahela
river
was
recalled
by
governor
dobbs
to
repel
the
attack
of
the
cherokees
on
old
fort
this
stronghold
was
built
amid
the
western
mountains
to
overawe
the
indians
and
as
a
refuge
for
the
settlers
governor
littleton
of
south
carolina
by
his
bad
management
had
most
wantonly
provoked
the
indians
into
this
condition
of
hostility
his
foolish
and
unnecessary
interference
and
cruelty
had
converted
these
usually
peaceful
neighbors
into
sufficient
hostility
to
make
it
easy
for
french
emissaries
to
obtain
their
active
aid
against
the
english
settlers
captain
dennie
with
his
company
was
also
besieged
at
fort
tellico
colonel
waddell
made
haste
with
his
battalion
and
drove
off
the
cherokees
burning
their
lodges
and
destroying
all
the
corn
he
could
find
another
battalion
remained
with
general
forbes
as
north
carolina
contingent
in
the
expedition
against
fort
du
quesne
these
things
occurred
in
in
england
the
administration
of
the
duke
of
newcastle
over
american
and
foreign
affairs
terminated
and
the
first
william
pitt
succeeded
to
his
place
in
every
portion
of
the
world
mighty
consequences
resulted
from
this
arrangement
the
fleets
and
armies
of
great
britain
were
animated
with
the
zeal
and
patriotism
of
that
great
statesman
of
all
the
victories
of
the
year
none
was
so
important
to
america
as
that
of
general
wolfe
over
the
french
at
quebec
it
broke
the
power
of
france
in
the
western
continent
and
stopped
in
a
great
measure
the
war
waged
by
indians
upon
the
frontier
settlements
at
no
period
has
the
population
of
north
carolina
increased
relatively
so
fast
as
during
these
years
now
under
consideration
up
to
the
death
of
governor
johnston
it
had
amounted
to
no
more
than
thirty
thousand
souls
but
since
that
time
had
more
than
doubled
in
the
exports
amounted
to
thousand
five
hundred
and
barrels
of
tar
twelve
thousand
and
barrels
of
turpentine
seven
hundred
and
thousand
staves
thousand
five
hundred
and
eighty
bushels
of
corn
besides
much
tobacco
pork
beef
and
other
commodities
the
most
discreditable
thing
in
governor
dobbs
administration
was
his
effort
to
procure
the
general
assembly
to
locate
the
provincial
capital
on
his
farm
called
tower
hill
this
was
the
place
where
the
indians
had
been
defeated
by
colonel
james
moore
in
he
failed
in
his
scheme
and
snow
hill
as
the
place
is
now
called
never
became
the
capital
of
north
carolina
he
was
often
at
variance
with
the
legislature
or
more
properly
the
house
of
assembly
concerning
the
courts
and
judges
he
wished
things
arranged
to
suit
certain
men
in
london
and
the
house
resolved
that
this
should
not
be
done
and
north
carolina
was
left
in
the
end
with
no
judges
but
the
justices
of
the
peace
even
before
this
there
was
much
complaint
concerning
the
extortions
of
public
officers
although
the
people
were
very
poor
the
agents
of
the
king
and
earl
granville
made
them
pay
enormous
license
and
poll
taxes
francis
corbin
one
of
the
king
agents
was
dragged
from
his
home
in
chowan
to
enfield
then
in
edgecombe
county
to
compel
him
to
repay
the
sums
which
he
had
unlawfully
exacted
he
gave
bail
and
promised
to
return
the
illegal
tribute
but
instead
of
complying
he
brought
suit
against
the
men
who
had
seized
him
the
matter
terminated
in
a
riot
in
which
some
of
the
chief
friends
of
governor
dobbs
were
concerned
the
governor
being
old
and
weary
of
contests
with
the
house
of
assembly
at
length
asked
for
leave
of
absence
but
died
at
his
place
on
town
creek
in
brunswick
county
before
sailing
for
england
he
was
devoted
to
his
sense
of
duty
to
the
king
and
was
in
many
ways
deserving
of
public
respect
questions
who
tools
the
oath
of
office
of
governor
in
can
you
give
some
traits
of
his
character
what
visit
was
made
by

how
was
the

was

what
noted

upon
every

what
great
victory
was
gained
in
america
at
this
period
what
good
resulted
to
the
whole
country
from
this
victory
what
had
been
the
increase
of
population
in

can
you
name
some
of
the
exports
where
did
governor

endeavor
to
have
the
capital
of
north

located
what
trouble
did
the
governor
have
with
the
legislature
with
what
result
of
what
extortions
did
the
people
complain
how
was
francis
corbin
treated
and
why
what
is
said
of
the
close
of
governor
dobbs
life
chapter
xx
governor
tryon
and
the
first
resistance
to
the
stamp
acts
to
some
months
before
the
death
of
governor
dobbs
there
had
come
over
from
england
a
handsome
polished
and
genial
officer
who
wore
the
uniform
of
the
queen
guards
this
was
colonel
william
tryon
recently
appointed
of
north
carolina
he
succeeded
governor
dobbs
and
left
a
name
that
will
never
be
forgotten
in
north
carolina
governor
tryon
was
accompanied
by
his
wife
and
her
sister
miss
esther
wake
they
were
ladies
of
great
attractiveness
and
were
destined
to
become
so
much
valued
by
the
people
that
their
family
name
is
still
preserved
in
our
midst
as
the
name
of
our
metropolitan
county
there
was
much
gaiety
seen
at
that
time
in
the
eastern
counties
the
indians
were
all
gone
beyond
the
blue
ridge
mountains
and
the
rude
huts
of
old
had
in
many
instances
been
replaced
by
large
and
costly
buildings
of
brick
weddings
were
generally
celebrated
by
balls
that
lasted
for
a
week
hospitality
was
unstinted
and
most
men
of
means
thought
their
establishments
imperfect
until
provided
with
a
private
race
course
with
hound
and
horn
there
was
great
diversion
for
game
was
abundant
and
the
sport
open
to
all
who
could
get
a
horse
to
ride
in
such
society
the
brilliant
family
of
the
governor
was
of
course
at
once
sure
of
unbounded
influence
perhaps
no
man
was
ever
more
warmly
esteemed
than
governor
tryon
during
the
first
years
of
his
rule
in
north
carolina
he
was
gracious
and
wary
at
the
same
time
he
knew
whom
to
cultivate
and
while
smiling
on
all
he
was
fast
making
friends
who
were
almost
ready
to
die
in
his
behalf
the
great
preacher
george
whitefield
came
to
the
state
in
and
moved
thousands
with
his
eloquence
his
new
sect
the
methodist
had
until
then
made
no
progress
in
north
carolina
and
his
converts
went
to
swell
the
numbers
of
the
baptists
who
were
more
numerous
than
any
other
denomination
there
was
the
utmost
kindness
of
feeling
between
the
new
governor
and
the
people
when
the
news
came
that
the
english
parliament
had
passed
a
law
called
the
stamp
act
it
had
been
much
talked
of
and
denounced
in
many
portions
of
america
and
now
with
a
unanimity
that
is
still
one
of
the
strangest
things
recorded
in
history
the
men
of
all
conditions
in
every
colony
arose
in
frenzy
and
swore
that
this
law
should
not
be
executed
in
america
the
stamp
act
required
that
all
colonial
legal
instruments
such
as
deeds
bonds
and
notes
should
be
written
only
upon
stamped
paper
otherwise
they
were
not
binding
or
of
any
effect
the
paper
was
prepared
in
england
to
be
sold
to
the
colonists
at
the
heavy
tax
of
one
and
two
dollars
upon
each
sheet
in
addition
to
this
the
act
contained
a
great
variety
of
other
ruinous
exactions
newspapers
and
pamphlets
were
taxed
more
than
such
publications
at
present
would
cost
an
advertisement
in
a
newspaper
paid
the
government
fifty
cents
almanacs
eight
cents
college
diplomas
ten
dollars
and
the
fee
charged
for
a
marriage
license
was
sometimes
as
high
as
fifteen
dollars
the
act
received
royal
assent
on
march
the
law
was
oppressive
upon
the
people
because
of
the
amount
exacted
but
was
considered
constitutional
in
england
by
many
great
lawyers
who
were
warm
friends
of
the
american
people
but
in
america
it
had
been
held
for
some
time
that
no
tax
levied
by
great
britain
without
the
consent
of
america
was
just
and
thus
every
man
resolved
that
the
stamp
act
should
not
be
enforced
when
the
news
reached
governor
tryon
at
new
bern
the
general
assembly
was
in
session
at
that
place
a
very
bold
and
fearless
man
colonel
john
ashe
was
then
speaker
of
the
house
of
assembly
governor
tryon
asked
of
ashe
in
private
conversation
what
the
house
would
do
as
to
the
new
law
we
will
resist
its
execution
to
the
death
said
he
and
that
very
day
governor
tryon
sent
them
all
home
by
proroguing
the
session
nor
did
he
permit
them
to
assemble
again
until
late
in
the
next
year
after
the
repeal
of
the
stamp
act
by
this
means
he
prevented
the
election
of
delegates
from
north
carolina
to
the
continental
congress
which
met
in
new
york
in
to
organize
the
opposition
to
that
oppressive
measure
prorogue
is
to
continue
or
adjourn
a
legislative
body
from
one
session
to
another
by
royal
or
state
the
first
step
of
the
people
in
their
resistance
to
the
stamp
act
was
to
carry
james
houston
who
had
been
appointed
stamp
agent
before
moses
john
derosset
who
was
then
mayor
of
wilmington
there
in
the
presence
of
many
distinguished
men
of
the
cape
fear
country
on
the
of
november
he
was
obliged
publicly
to
resign
his
office
in
the
court
house
of
wilmington
and
make
oath
that
he
would
have
no
further
connection
with
it
twelve
days
later
on
the
november
the
ship
of
war
diligence
arrived
with
stamps
the
commander
was
told
by
armed
men
under
colonels
ashe
and
waddell
that
they
must
not
be
landed
and
no
effort
was
made
to
do
so
on
the
december
the
governor
issued
his
proclamation
dissolving
the
general
assembly
and
on
the
same
day
took
the
opinion
of
his
council
and
the
whether
writs
can
issue
for
the
election
of
a
new
assembly
as
the
circulation
of
the
stamps
is
obstructed
the
council
and
advised
that
the
writs
could
go
without
stamps
on
the
january
governor
tryon
taking
fresh
courage
from
some
source
went
so
far
as
to
issue
a
proclamation
announcing
that
the
stamps
were
on
board
the
diligence
and
ready
for
distribution
it
did
no
good
however
for
no
one
would
use
them
comparative
quiet
now
ensued
for
some
weeks
but
it
was
only
the
calm
before
the
storm
on
the
of
february
two
vessels
that
had
come
up
to
the
port
of
brunswick
without
stamps
upon
their
clearance
papers
were
promptly
seized
by
the
custom
house
officers
and
then
the
storm
arose
on
the
armed
men
broke
open
the
desk
of
the
collector
of
the
port
and
forcibly
carried
off
the
unstamped
clearance
papers
of
the
two
vessels
on
the
a
committee
of
armed
men
appeared
on
board
the
viper
and
demanded
of
captain
lobb
the
two
sloops
he
was
guarding
meanwhile
armed
men
were
continually
coming
into
brunswick
from
different
counties
on
the
evening
of
the
pennington
another
stamp
distributor
took
refuge
in
governor
tryon
house
shortly
after
eight
on
the
morning
of
the
armed
men
appeared
before
the
governor
house
and
sent
him
a
note
desiring
him
to
permit
pennington
to
appear
before
them
and
informing
him
that
it
would
not
be
in
the
power
of
the
directors
appointed
to
prevent
the
ill
consequences
that
may
attend
a
refusal
the
governor
replied
that
any
gentleman
who
had
business
with
pennington
might
see
him
at
the
house
this
however
was
by
no
means
satisfactory
and
in
a
short
time
according
to
the
governor
statement
a
body
of
some
five
hundred
men
in
arms
moved
toward
his
house
a
detachment
of
sixty
then
came
down
the
avenue
and
the
main
body
drew
up
in
sight
and
within
three
hundred
yards
of
the
house
cornelius
harnett
a
representative
in
the
assembly
for
wilmington
came
at
the
head
of
the
detachment
and
sent
a
message
asking
to
speak
with
pennington
when
he
came
into
the
house
he
told
pennington
the
gentlemen
wanted
him
the
governor
replied
that
pennington
was
in
his
house
for
refuge
and
that
he
would
protect
him
to
the
utmost
harnett
thereupon
said
he
hoped
the
governor
would
let
pennington
go
as
the
people
were
determined
to
take
him
out
of
the
house
if
he
should
be
longer
detained
an
insult
harnett
said
they
wished
to
avoid
giving
to
the
governor
the
governor
protested
it
mattered
not
about
that
insult
after
they
had
already
offered
him
every
insult
they
could
offer
by
investing
his
house
and
virtually
making
him
a
prisoner
before
any
grievance
had
been
made
known
to
him
pennington
growing
apprehensive
and
showing
a
disposition
to
go
with
harnett
the
governor
suggested
to
him
that
he
resign
before
he
left
to
this
he
agreed
and
thereupon
the
governor
let
him
go
he
was
afterward
compelled
to
take
an
oath
that
he
would
never
issue
any
stamped
paper
in
the
province
as
were
all
the
clerks
of
the
county
courts
and
other
public
officers
the
inhabitants
in
the
language
of
the
governor

redressed

the
manner
described
their
grievances
complained
of
left
the
town
of
brunswick
about
one
on
the
these
things
were
done
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
in
the
broad
daylight
and
by
men
perfectly
well
known
and
without
a
particle
of
disguise
after
this
vessels

left
the
ports
of
north

as
if
no
stamp
act
had
ever
been
passed
on
june
came
news
from
england
of
the
repeal
of
the
law
that
had
so
terribly
excited
and
aroused
america
governor
tryon
announced
the
fact
in
a
proclamation
but
he
had
been
humiliated
by
the
resistance
at
wilmington
and
from
that
hour
probably
determined
on
the
revenge
which
he
afterwards
exacted
at
alamance
note
governor
tryon
desired
to
regain
his
influence
for
political
purposes
over
the
people
whom
he
had
so
greatly
offended
and
he
ordered
a
general
muster
at
wilmington
he
prepared
a
feast
for
the
militia
of
whole
oxen
roasted
and
barrels
of
beer
when
the
feast
was
ready
the
people
rushed
to
the
tables
and
threw
the
oxen
into
the
river
and
emptied
the
beer
upon
the
ground
a
general
fight
ensued
between
the
militia
and
the
men
of
the
english
vessels
and
perfect
quiet
was
not
restored
for
several
days

how

did
the

of
these
things
what
was
the
conclusion
of
this
affair
what
joyful
news
was
received
on
june
how
had
governor
tryon
been
affected
by
the
resistance
of
the
people
to
the
stamp
act
chapter
xxi
governor
tryon
and
the
regulators
to
in
the
middle
and
western
counties
of
north
carolina
in
the
period
referred
to
there
was
collected
a
large
increase
of
population
immigrants
had
come
in
large
companies
from
scotland
ireland
england
and
germany
fully
two
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
were
by
that
time
to
be
found
east
of
the
blue
ridge
mountains
they
were
separated
by
that
great
barrier
from
the
cherokees
who
latterly
had
well
respected
this
line
of
separation
a
great
portion
of
the
western
settlers
had
recently
come
to
their
new
homes
and
were
very
poorly
provided
with
the
means
of
living
they
were
hundreds
of
miles
from
market
and
made
nothing
on
their
farms
to
sell
but
wheat
these
farmers
were
taxed
about
twelve
dollars
apiece
on
the
poll
and
paid
an
annual
rent
of
cents
on
each
one
hundred
acres
of
their
land
when
they
hauled
wheat
to
cross
creek
now
fayetteville
it
realized
but
little
more
than
enough
to
pay
for
the
salt
needed
in
the
family
sugar
and
coffee
were
luxuries
in
which
they
rarely
indulged
it
can
thus
be
seen
how
cruel
would
have
been
even
an
honest
collection
of
what
the
laws
demanded
of
these
recent
settlers
as
taxes
when
these
sums
were
enormously
increased
by
dishonest
sheriffs
the
farmers
were
in
despair
for
it
was
beyond
their
power
to
pay
the
farmers
knew
they
were
being
cheated
and
resolved
to
put
an
end
to
such
practices
colonel
edmund
fanning
of
hillsboro
in
orange
county
was
growing
rich
as
register
of
deeds
and
was
the
ringleader
in
this
oppression
of
the
people
in
this
same
county
lived
herman
husbands
who
was
a
quaker
preacher
and
though
of
limited
education
was
a
man
of
considerable
natural
abilities
he
prevailed
on
his
neighbors
at
sandy
creek
to
form
an
association
for
mutual
protection
against
the
wrongs
of
the
public
officers
his
organization
was
known
as
the
regulators
and
they
were
to
help
each
other
in
the
lawsuits
and
indictments
growing
out
of
a
refusal
to
pay
unlawful
demands
this
was
wise
and
proper
as
these
men
were
not
rebellious
but
only
desired
relief
from
oppression
but
husbands
should
have
joined
the
league
he
was
thus
creating
and
thereby
shared
the
liabilities
of
the
members
this
he
would
not
do
but
preached
and
harangued
until
the
people
were
in
a
fever
of
excitement
the
first
trouble
grew
out
of
a
seizure
of
a
horse
from
one
of
two
men
sent
to
hillsboro
on
a
mission
to
the
sheriff
the
regulators
retook
the
horse
by
force
and
fired
into
the
roof
of
colonel
fanning
house
that
night
husbands
was
arrested
and
carried
to
hillsboro
and
gave
bail
for
his
appearance
at
the
next
superior
court
he
had
hardly
left
hillsboro
before
seven
hundred
men
came
to
his
rescue
they
went
away
with
promises
made
by
isaac
edwards
who
was
tryon
secretary
that
the
governor
would
redress
their
wrongs
governor
tryon
went
to
hillsboro
in
a
few
weeks
but
condemned
only
the
people
who
had
asked
his
aid
and
after
going
further
west
came
back
to
the
superior
court
with
an
army
of
eleven
hundred
men
which
he
had
raised
in
mecklenburg
and
rowan
counties
husbands
was
acquitted
on
trial
but
three
other
regulators
were
heavily
fined
and
imprisoned
colonel
fanning
was
convicted
in
five
cases
of
extortion
in
office
and
the
judges
to
their
shame
imposed
a
fine
of
only
one
penny
in
each
case
this
marching
of
troops
and
the
failure
of
the
court
to
do
its
duty
only
made
matters
worse
the
regulators
grew
in
numbers
and
violence
until
the
courts
could
not
be
held
in
some
counties
husbands
was
expelled
from
his
place
in
the
house
of
assembly
and
thrown
into
prison
for
a
libel
on
judge
maurice
moore
his
release
was
effected
in
time
to
stop
a
crowd
of
several
hundred
men
from
going
to
new
bern
where
they
had
declared
they
would
release
him
and
burn
the
splendid
palace
the
governor
had
just
built
matters
continued
to
grow
worse
until
in
governor
tryon
raised
an
army
in
the
eastern
counties
under
a
law
of
the
assembly
and
marched
to
orange
to
put
down
what
he
called
the
rebellion
of
the
regulators
colonel
waddell
with
another
body
of
troops
marched
from
salisbury
to
join
him
but
was
met
by
the
regulators
and
driven
back
on
the
of
may
the
force
of
governor
tryon
numbering
eleven
hundred
men
met
about
two
thousand
of
the
regulators
at
a
place
called
alamance
in
orange
county
in
the
battle
that
ensued
there
was
stubborn
fighting
until
the
ammunition
of
the
regulators
was
exhausted
and
they
were
driven
from
the
field
many
men
lost
their
lives
and
all
that
was
gained
by
north
carolina
after
a
noble
resistance
to
oppression
was
that
edmund
fanning
and
others
who
were
largely
responsible
for
all
its
disorders
left
the
province
the
brutal
malice
and
cruelty
in
governor
tryon
character
was
exhibited
soon
after
the
battle
several
prisoners
were
taken
by
him
and
one
of
them
a
poor
youth
named
james
few
was
by
tryon
order
hung
on
the
spot
without
trial
twelve
other
prisoners
were
soon
convicted
of
high
treason
and
sentenced
to
death
six
of
them
were
hanged
almost
immediately
the
execution
of
the
others
was
delayed
for
a
few
days
in
order
that
a
grand
military
display
might
be
made
on
the
occasion
the
details
of
which
the
governor
superintended
in
person
note
it
has
been
said
that
the
battle
of
alamance
was
begun
by
governor
tryon
who
fired
the
first
gun
at
a
prisoner
named
robert
thompson
killing
him
instantly
the
men
seemed
to
hesitate
about
beginning
the
fight
and
governor
tryon
rising
in
his
stirrups
exclaimed
fire
fire
on
them
or
on
me
governor
tryon
left
the
province
a
month
after
the
battle
of
alamance
to
become
by
the
king
appointment
governor
of
new
york
he
had
signally
failed
to
do
his
duty
in
compelling
his
subordinates
to
deal
honestly
with
the
people
but
yet
he
retained
the
confidence
of
many
able
and
patriotic
men
richard
caswell
and
many
other
leaders
in
the
province
were
distressed
that
he
had
ceased
to
be
the
chief
magistrate
of
north
carolina
questions
how
were
the
middle
and
western
sections
of
north
carolina
being
peopled
at
this
period
give
some
description
of
these
people
how
were
they
taxed
what
return
did
the
sale
of
their
crops
bring
them
how
was
theirs
a
hard
lot
by
whom
were
the
poor
farmers
being
oppressed
what
noted
man
is
now
mentioned
can
you
tell
something
of
the
acts
of
herman
husbands
in
the
province
how
did
he
shrink
from
becoming
a
member
of
his
league
what
was

how
did

terminate
how
were
the

affected
by
this
mock
judgment

next
fall
what
steps
were
taken
by
governor

can
you

memorable
battle
of

out
on

the
scene
of
the

conduct
after
the
battle

did

leave
north
carolina
and
for
what
purpose
chapter
xxii
governor
martin
and
the
revolution
to
james
hasell
as
president
of
the
council
assumed
the
conduct
of
affairs
until
the
arrival
of
the
new
governor
this
new
governor
josiah
martin
was
born
april
and
had
been
a
in
the
british
army
which
position
he
was
obliged
to
resign
on
account
of
his
health
he
then
sought
civil
employment
and
was
appointed
governor
of
north
carolina
he
was
a
far
more
honorable
man
than
tryon
he
had
no
unworthy
favorites
as
tryon
had
and
concocted
no
selfish
schemes
for
his
own
benefit
or
that
of
his
family
but
was
exceedingly
obstinate
and
strict
in
the
observance
of
royal
prerogatives
unattractive
in
his
manners
and
very
positive
in
his
opinions
he
sometimes
failed
to
withhold
the
manifestations
of
his
displeasure
towards
those
who
might
happen
to
differ
with
him
no
matter
how
honestly
perhaps
however
in
the
fierce
antagonisms
of
the
times
in
which
he
ruled
in
north
carolina
his
real
virtues
were
not
appreciated
as
they
deserved
governor
martin
met
the
assembly
for
the
first
time
in
new
bern
on
the
of
november
at
his
suggestion
the
legislature
passed
an
act
of
amnesty
toward
all
persons
engaged
in
the
war
of
the
regulation
except
husbands
and
a
few
other
leaders
such
wise
and
merciful
action
however
was
not
to
be
the
rule
of
his
life
it
had
long
been
felt
that
the
taxes
were
exceedingly
burdensome
and
from
a
statement
made
to
the
legislature
at
this
time
by
one
of
the
public
treasurers
of
the
real
condition
of
the
public
funds
it
was
seen
that
these
taxes
had
been
for
a
time
at
least
unnecessarily
imposed
the
treasurer
showed
that
a
full
collection
of
the
amounts
in
arrear
for
which
security
had
been
given
would
discharge
the
entire
public
debt
and
leave
in
the
public
treasury
the
sum
of
twenty
thousand
dollars
a
bill
was
at
once
passed
in
both
houses
of
the
legislature
and
without
opposition
in
either
discontinuing
the
special
taxes
that
had
been
devoted
to
the
extinguishment
of
the
public
debt
governor
martin
however
vetoed
the
bill
and
thus
began
a
series
of
conflicts
with
the
legislature
that
lasted
until
his
expulsion
from
the
province
the
repeal
of
the
stamp
act
had
been
gratefully
received
but
parliament
still
excited
great
apprehension
by
an
express
and
formal
assertion
of
its
powers
to
tax
america
it
had
cost
immense
sums
to
the
crown
to
drive
out
the
french
and
much
money
was
still
needed
to
pay
british
expenses
in
america
it
was
insisted
that
the
colonies
ought
to
pay
their
fair
share
in
these
burdens
the
great
question
was
how
this
was
to
be
done
if
parliament
could
levy
what
it
pleased
then
americans
were
no
longer
free
in
that
they
were
not
masters
of
their
own
purses
many
propositions
were
made
to
arrange
the
difficulty
but
none
were
satisfactory
to
both
sides
so
dissatisfied
was
governor
martin
with
his
first
legislature
that
he
speedily
dissolved
it
and
did
not
permit
a
new
one
to
meet
until
the
last
of
january
the
new
legislature
met
in
new
bern
and
the
house
gave
notice
of
its
temper
by
electing
as
its
speaker
john
harvey
of
perquimans
admitted
on
all
hands
to
be
the
most
earnest
supporter
of
colonial
rights
in
all
the
province
upon
every
important
subject
of
legislation
the
governor
and
the
new
assembly
were
at
variance
and
he
accordingly
dissolved
it
on
the
of
march
declaring
that
it
had
deserted
its
duty
and
flagrantly
insulted
the
dignity
and
authority
of
the
government
the
next
assembly
met
in
new
bern
on
the
of
december
and
continued
in
session
seventeen
days
when
it
shared
the
fate
of
its
predecessor
and
was
sent
home
with
the
injunction
to
consult
with
the
people
and
learn
their
will
short
as
was
the
session
however
its
action
was
most
important
on
the
day
after
the
session
began
letters
were
received
from
the
legislature
of
virginia
and
other
colonies
proposing
that
each
province
should
appoint
a
committee
of
correspondence
the
proposition
was
speedily
agreed
to
by
the
house
of
assembly
and
a
committee
of
nine
appointed
with
instructions
to
obtain
the
most
early
and
authentic
intelligence
of
all
such
acts
and
resolutions
of
the
british
parliament
or
proceedings
of
administration
as
may
relate
to
or
affect
the
british
colonies
in
america
and
to
keep
and
maintain
a
correspondence
and
communication
with
all
sister
colonies
respecting
these
important
considerations
and
the
result
of
such
their
proceedings

to

samuel
johnston
joseph
hewes
edward
vail
cornelius
harnett
john
ashe
william
hooper
and
robert
howe
constituted
the
committee
and
certainly
in
north
carolina
at
least
it
may
be
said
there
was
never
an
abler
one
by
this
action
the
province
took
position
with
its
sister
colonies
on
the
great
question
of
the
day
that
the
question
was
regarded
as
one
of
great
importance
and
great
gravity
if
not
of
great
difficulty
we
need
no
other
assurance
than
that
afforded
by
the
character
of
the

into
whose
hands
it
was
committed

chosen
by
the
several
colonies
had
suggested
itself
to
men
of
sagacity
in
every
portion
of
the
country
wherever
made
the
suggestion
at
once
found
a
lodgment
in
public
favor
and
by
the
time
summer
had
come
it
was
a
generally
accepted
fact
that
such
a
congress
would
be
held
and
the
time
and
place
of
its
session
pretty
well
agreed
upon
during
the
month
of
june
each
colony
through
its
committee
of
correspondence
was
invited
to
send
delegates
to
a
continental
congress
to
be
held
in
philadelphia
during
the
coming
september
from
its
first
agitation
the
project
of
a
continental
congress
to
consider
the
best
ways
and
means
of
redressing
the
grievances
of
the
colonists
was
exceedingly
distasteful
to
governor
martin
for
he
regarded
it
as
a
most
efficient
way
to
organize
rebellion
he
resolved
that
he
would
prevent
north
carolina
from
participating
in
such
a
congress
as
governor
tryon
had
prevented
her
from
participating
in
a
similar
one
in
to
this
end
he
determined
that
during
the
continuance
of
the
existing
disturbed
condition
of
the
colonies
no
legislature
should
meet
in
north
carolina
thinking
thereby
to
prevent
the
due
election
of
delegates
from
the
province
to
this
fixed
purpose
on
the
part
of
governor
martin
made
known
to
john
harvey
through
biggleston
the
private
secretary
the
congress
held
at
new
bern
in
august
owed
its
existence
when
biggleston
told
him
the
governor
did
not
intend
to
call
another
legislature
until
he
saw
a
chance
to
get
a
better
one
harvey
replied
then
the
people
will
convene
one
themselves
accordingly
about
the
first
of
july
in
accordance
with
a
plan
agreed
upon
three
months
before
between
willie
jones
of
halifax
samuel
johnston
of
chowan
and
edward
buncombe
of
tyrrell
harvey
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
assembly
issued
handbills
calling
upon
the
people
to
elect
delegates
to
a
provincial
congress
as
it
was
called
to
assemble
in
new
bern
on
the
of
august
to
express
the
sentiments
of
the
people
on
the
acts
lately
passed
by
the
parliament
of
great
britain
and
to
appoint
delegates
to
represent
the
province
in
a
continental
congress
the
handbills
of
this
bold
speaker
also
invited
the
people
to
invest
the
deputies
whom
they
might
send
to
new
bern
with
powers
obligatory
on
the
future
conduct
of
the
inhabitants
the
elections
for
deputies
were
duly
held
about
the
first
of
august
and
the
governor
finding
himself
thus
completely
checkmated
was
furious
the
calm
audacity
of
the
speaker
in
summoning
such
a
body
to
meet
in
new
bern
in
the
very
presence
of
the
king
represent
representatives
as
the
governor
said
to
concert
treasonable
schemes
against
the
crown
astounded
him
up
to
this
time
governor
martin
had
not
at
all
realized
how
weak
had
become
the
ties
that
bound
the
people
of
the
colony
of
north
carolina
to
the
mother
country
nor
did
he
believe
they
would
with
any
degree
of
unanimity
whatever
take
so
bold
and
defiant
a
step
in
the
direction
of
open
rebellion
as
that
involved
in
the
election
of
a
congress
with
powers
obligatory
on
the
people
but
owing
no
obedience
to
the
authority
of
the
crown
yet
at
the
appointed
times
and
places
with
few
exceptions
the
people
throughout
the
provinces
openly
assembled
and
elected
delegates
to
the
proposed
congress
clothing
them
with
most
extraordinary
powers
this
evidence
of
the
condition
of
popular
sentiment
in
the
province
could
neither
be
doubted
nor
disregarded
accordingly
on
the
of
august
the
governor
asked
his
council
to
advise
him
what
to
do
in
a
state
of
affairs
so
inconsistent
with
the
peace
and
good
order
of
the
government
and
so
injurious
to
the
maintenance
of
the
authority
of
the
crown
after
deliberating
for
a
day
on
the
matter
the
council
advised
him
to
issue
a
proclamation
and
he
did
so
condemning
the
elections
just
held
as
highly
illegal
and
warning
all
officers
of
the
king
both
civil
and
military
to
do
all
in
their
power
to
prevent
such
assemblages
of
the
people
and
especially
the
meeting
of
the
deputies
or
delegates
at
new
bern
on
the
instant
in
spite
of
all
this
the
first
provincial
congress
in
north
carolina
met
at
new
bern
august
and
elected
john
harvey
as
moderator
or
president
richard
caswell
joseph
hewes
and
william
hooper
were
chosen
as
delegates
to
the
continental
congress
protesting
their
loyalty
to
the
crown
but
expressing
a
full
determination
to
defend
their
rights
as
freemen
the
members
entered
into
an
agreement
that
unless
their
grievances
were
redressed
they
would
discontinue
all
trade
with
english
merchants
this
congress
was
the
first
great
step
in
the
revolution
which
was
to
deliver
north
carolina
and
america
from
the
dominion
of
a
distant
king
and
parliament
the
men
of
america
were
soon
to
be
free
from
all
foreign
interference
in
their
government
it
was
a
bold
and
hazardous
step
in
colonel
harvey
and
the
men
over
whom
he
presided
as
moderator
but
safety
in
the
end
was
the
reward
of
those
who
thus
dared
to
be
free
questions
what
important
step
was
suggesting
itself
to
the
people
how
was
the
suggestion
received
what
was
done
in
june
how
did
governor
martin
regard
this
matter
what
did
he
determine
to
do
what
vas
the
result
of
the
governor
plan
what
was
done
by
john
harvey
how
was
governor
martin
affected
by
harvey
success
what
had
the
governor
begun
to
realize
what
was
done
by
the
people
what
advice
did
the
governor
seek
what
was

when
and
where
did
the
first
provincial
congress
of
north
carolina
meet
who
was

who
were
chosen
as

to
the
continental

what
is
said
of
this
provincial
congress
chapter
xxiv
the
second
provincial
congress
after
the
meeting
of
the
first
provincial
congress
at
new
bern
there
were
to
all
observers
of
intelligence
throughout
the
world
evident
signs
of
an
approaching
rupture
between
the
royal
government
and
the
people
of
north
carolina
each
day
widened
the
breach
between
them
and
rendered
more
difficult
an
arrangement
of
the
troubles
in
the
regular
course
of
events
if
north
carolina
would
continue
to
keep
abreast
of
her
sister
colonies
in
the
movement
for
the
preservation
of
the
inherent
rights
of
british
subjects
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
formally
ratify
and
approve
the
action
recently
taken
by
the
continental
congress
and
to
elect
delegates
to
that
congress
for
a
new
term
accordingly
on
the
of
february
after
the
governor
had
ordered
an
election
to
be
held
for
a
new
legislature
to
meet
in
new
bern
on
the
of
april
colonel
harvey
also
issued
handbills
for
the
election
of
another
congress
to
meet
at
the
same
time
and
place
both
elections
were
held
and
both
bodies
met
at
the
appointed
time
and
place
indeed
the
same
individuals
were
members
of
both
the
house
of
assembly
and
of
the
congress
the
records
show
that
every
member
of
the
house
of
assembly
who
was
present
was
also
present
as
a
member
of
the
congress
with
only
three
exceptions
colonel
harvey
was
chosen
to
preside
over
both
bodies
when
sitting
at
the
house
of
assembly
the
members
called
him
speaker
but
when
sitting
as
a
congress
they
called
him
mr
moderator
according
to
the
journals
of
their
proceedings
the
congress
met
at
nine
and
the
assembly
at
ten
in
the
morning
upon
the
face
of
the
journals
of
the
two
bodies
their
proceedings
seem
to
have
been
entirely
separate
and
distinct
it
is
said
however
to
have
been
otherwise
in
fact
and
that
at
one
moment
the
members
would
be
sitting
with
speaker
harvey
as
a
house
of
assembly
under
the
authority
of
the
crown
and
at
another
with
moderator
harvey
as
a
congress
in
defiance
of
the
crown
as
the
two
houses
of
the
legislature
met
governor
martin
in
the
palace
according
to
the
custom
of
that
day
at
the
beginning
of
a
session
he
saluted
them
with
indignant
remonstrances
which
were
the
next
day
most
ably
answered
in
an
address
prepared
by
captain
robert
howe
of
brunswick
a
chief
ground
of
his
complaint
was
that
the
assembly
would
take
no
action
against
the
congress
he
was
aptly
reminded
however
in
reply
that
as
the
assembly
had
no
control
over
its
sessions
holding
them
at
his
will
and
pleasure
only
and
remembering
how
that
will
and
pleasure
had
been
exercised
a
congress
that
did
have
control
over
itself
was
absolutely
necessary
for
the
protection
of
the
people
the
result
was
a
proclamation
dissolving
the
assembly
on
the
of
april
that
being
the
fourth
day
of
its
session
the
congress
however
could
neither
be
dissolved
nor
dispersed
and
proceeded
in
its
work
with
much
deliberation
the
same
delegation
was
returned
to
philadelphia
and
articles
of
association
pledging
the
members
to
abstain
from
all
commerce
with
british
marts
were
signed
by
all
except
thomas
mcknight
of
currituck
it
was
seen
that
a
crisis
was
near
at
hand
boston
had
been
held
for
months
past
in
a
state
of
siege
at
length
on
april
came
the
encounter
at
lexington
accidents
are
constantly
heard
of
wherein
more
lives
are
lost
but
this
little
skirmish
small
as
it
was
was
enough
with
its
tidings
to
fire
the
hearts
of
a
continent
the
tidings
of
such
an
occurrence
in
our
day
outstrips
the
winds
in
less
than
an
hour
it
is
known
all
over
the
mississippi
valley
across
the
rocky
mountains
and
along
the
shores
of
the
pacific
ocean
but
our
ancestors
of
that
day
had
no
railways
or
telegraphs
so
it
was
fully
two
weeks
after
the
militiamen
slain
at
lexington
had
stiffened
in
their
blood
that
richard
caswell
heard
of
it
in
petersburg
virginia
a
courier
was
hurrying
southward
with
the
tidings
but
it
was
not
until
may
that
the
people
of
mecklenburg
in
north
carolina
became
aware
of
what
had
occurred
at
the
village
of
charlotte
upon
that
day
a
large
concourse
of
the
leading
men
of
that
county
had
assembled
fired
at
the
nature
of
the
startling
intelligence
they
held
a
convention
and
after
remaining
in
session
all
night
on
the
morning
of
the
passed
resolutions
of
independence
that
will
immortalize
their
names
all
america
while
arming
for
the
war
was
still
protesting
loyalty
to
the
king
but
these
men
of
mecklenburg
leaped
to
a
conclusion
the
expediency
of
which
more
than
a
year
of
blood
was
required
to
impress
on
the
minds
of
their
countrymen
abraham
alexander
presided
in
the
meeting
and
the
famous
mecklenburg
declaration
of
independence
was
drawn
by
ephraim
breyard
note
the
men
of
mecklenburg
held
another
meeting
on
may
and
adopted
a
system
of
government
and
military
commissions

people
publicly
declared
themselves
free
from
english
rule
nearly
fourteen
months
before
the
declaration
of
independence
at
philadelphia
the
news
from
boston
was
speedily
followed
in
north
carolina
by
mournful
tidings
from
perquimans
county
colonel
john
harvey
after
so
many
strenuous
efforts
to
put
north
carolina
in
readiness
for
the
storm

under
disease
and
died
at
his
place
in
harvey

or
wiser
man
has
ever

his

but
went
himself
by
land
to
fort
johnston
at
the
mouth
of
the
cape
fear
but
even
fort
johnston
proved
unsafe
as
a
place
of
refuge
and
in
july
the
governor
left
it
and
went
on
board
the
war
sloop
cruiser
then
lying
in

before
the
fort
on
the
same
day
colonel

been

in

to
order
an

congress
to

whenever

should

accordingly
colonel
harvey
having
died
the
congress
met
at
the
call
of
johnston
in
hillsboro
on
the
of
august
and
a
memorable
congress
it
was
samuel
johnston
was
its
president
when
governor
martin
left
new
bern
royal
authority
was
virtually
at
an
end
in
north
carolina
but
it
was
at
hillsboro
and
by
the
congress
there
assembled
that
its
last
vestige
was
swept
away
the
time
had
come
when
if
north
carolina
intended
to
stand
with
her
sister
colonies
she
must
take
up
arms
and
appeal
to
the
god
of
battles
this
she
was
ready
to
do
without
any
hesitation
and
this
she
did
do
at
hillsboro
giving
publicly
to
the
world
her
reasons
for
so
doing
the
governor
sent
to
samuel
johnston
a
copy
of
his
proclamation
dated
on
board
his
majesty
ship
cruiser
at
cape
fear
on
the
of
august
in
which
he
warned
the
people
against
the
hillsboro
congress
as
a
dangerous
and
unconstitutional
assembly
and
of
baneful
influence
and
further
that
to
assemble
men
in
arms
in
the
province
without
authority
from
the
king
was
a
violation
of
law
for
which
they
would
be
held
answerable
in
reply
to
this
proclamation
which
was
duly
laid
before
the
congress
by
the
moderator
johnston
it
was
formally
resolved
that
the
proclamation
was
a
false
scandalous
scurrilous
and
seditious
libel
tending
to
disunite
the
good
people
of
the
province
and
further
that
the
said
paper
be
burnt
by
the
common
hangman
accepting
the
recent
flight
of
governor
martin
to
the
british
cruiser
as
an
abdication
of
the
government
of
the
crown
the
congress
proceeded
to
put
in
its
place
a
government
of

people
and
established

would
be
called

large

were

a

too
was
ordered
to
be
taken
without
delay
an
issue
of
money
to
meet
expenses
was
also
provided
for
in
a
word
every
function
of
government
was
from
that
time
exercised
in
the
name
and
by
the
authority
of
the
people
of
north
carolina
virtually
the
province
was
under
martial
law
but
it
was
under
martial
law
it
is
evident
that
the
men
who
constituted
the
hillsboro
or
third
provincial
congress
knew
perfectly
well
what
they
were
doing
and
had
fully
counted
the
cost
success
meant
freedom
and
would
make
them
patriots
failure
meant
abject
submission
to
a
foreign
government
and
would
make
them
traitors
knowing
this
they
deliberately
put
a
government
of
the
people
in
the
place
of
the
government
of
the
king
they
put
an
army
in
the
field
and
provided
it
with
arms
and
ammunition
and
as
if
looking
ahead
to
a
long
and
protracted
struggle
during
which
their
ports
would
be
doubtless
blockaded
they
sought
at
once
by
the
offer
of
large
bounties
to
encourage
the
manufacture
at
home
of
such
articles
as
were
of
common
use
and
prime
necessity
they
were
indeed
both
bold
and
those
men
of
the
hillsboro
congress
and
well
they
might
be
for
they
were
the
best
and
bravest
of
the
whose
names
are
now
household
words
throughout
the
state
the
hillsboro
congress
had
not
called
out
troops
any
too
soon
for
it
was
discovered
that
both
governor
martin
in
north
carolina
and
lord
dunmore
in
virginia
were
engaged
in
schemes
to
excite
insurrections
among
the
negro
slaves
colonel
robert
howe
with
the
second
north
carolina
regiment
was
sent
to
norfolk
in
virginia
where
the
british
troops
being
beaten
at
great
bridge
were
soon
driven
from
the
soil
of
the
old
dominion
this
occurred
in
december
about
the
same
time
colonels
griffith
rutherford
thomas
polk
and
james
martin
embodied
their
militia
regiments
and
went
to
south
carolina
where
they
speedily
crushed
a
tory
insurrection
of
certain
men
called
the
scovilites
the
militia
were
of
course
aided
by
whig
troops
of
that
province
the
readiness
with
which
north
carolina
marched
troops
both
to
virginia
and
to
south
carolina
caused
her
to
stand
very
high
in
the
estimation
of
the
continental
congress
the
term
tory
was
applied
to
men
who
upheld
the
royal
authority
and
were
opposed
to
any
movement
to
defend
the
colonies
against
the
exactions
of
the
crown
and
parliament
the
whigs
on
the
contrary
were
at
that
day
demanding
that
american
commerce
should
be
free
and
that
no
taxes
should
be
imposed
by
great
britain
upon
the
colonies
they
were
not
enemies
to
the
king
and
only
opposed
to

was
closely
watched
by

who
kept
his
command
the
first
north
carolina
regiment
in
that
vicinity
in
february
came
the
news
that
the
scotch
highlanders
and
regulators
were
gathering
at
a
place
called
at
that
day
cross
creek
and
now
the
town
of
fayetteville
this
place
and
in
this
connection
will
be
remembered
as
the
home
of
the
beautiful
heroine
flora
mcdonald
and
her
husband
like
her
husband
she
was
a
staunch
tory
and
did
all
she
could
to
promote
the
insurrection
this
famous
woman
had
won
the
world
admiration
by
her
heroic
efforts
to
aid
the
unfortunate
prince
charles
edward
after
his
defeat
at
culloden
he
was
being
hunted
like
a
wild
beast
by
the
troops
of
the
king
but
flora
mcdonald
bravely
left
her
home
and
went
off
with
the
disguised
prince
until
after
many
perils
he
reached
a
vessel
on
the
coast
end
thus
escaped
to
his
friends
in
a
large
fleet
and
army
were
said
to
be
on
their
way
from
england
to
take
the
town
of
wilmington
these
scotchmen
assembling
at
cross
creek
by
governor
martin
orders
were
in
arms
to
force
their
way
across
the
country
and
join
the
expected
british
army
colonel
moore
at
once
met
them
at
rockfish
creek
where
he
fortified
his
camp
and
awaited
an
attack
but
he
soon
found
this
would
not
occur
so
he
sent
colonel
lillington
and
captain
ashe
with
two
hundred
and
fifty
then
to
occupy
a
bridge
over
moore
creek
that
he
supposed
would
intercept
general
donald
mcdonald
who
commanded
the
tories
whigs
in
arms
were
assembling
from
different
directions
and
the
tories
soon
saw
that
unless
they
passed
colonel
moore
they
would
be
surrounded
and
captured
mcdonald
was
an
old
and
skillful
officer
and
he
moved
across
the
cape
fear
river
to
meet
colonel
caswell
who
was
coming
up
from
new
bern
with
a
command
of
eight
hundred
men
which
had
been
raised
in
that
section
caswell
made
haste
to
join
lillington
on
moore
creek
and
artfully
led
the
enemy
to
believe
that
he
was
camping
on
the
evening
of
february
on
the
same
side
of
the
stream
with
him
he
left
his
fires
burning
and
in
the
darkness
crossed
the
bridge
removed
the
timbers
except
two
log
girders
and
took
up
a
position
supporting
lillington
and
ashe
who
had
already
put
themselves
in
the
best
place
to
prevent
the
passage
of
the
tories
in
the
darkness
of
early
dawn
on
the
colonel
donald
mcleod
took
the
place
of
his
sick
commander
general
mcdonald
and
fell
upon
what
he
had
been
led
to
believe
was
colonel
caswell
camp
but
his
spies
had
been
misled
and
his
foes
were
to
be
reached
only
by
crossing
the
bridge
before
him
the
prospect
was
appalling
but
mcleod
was
brave
and
putting
himself
at
the
head
of
a
picked
band
of
broadswordsmen
he
charged
across
the
remaining
two
logs
of
the
bridge
it
was
a
terrible
moment
when
the
whigs
saw
these
dauntless
highlanders
who
had
so
often
broken
the
strongest
lines
of
troops
in
europe
rushing
furiously
upon
them
but
they
were
cool
and
plied
the
deadly
rifles
upon
the
scotchmen
as
fast
as
they
came
colonel
mcleod
fell
dead
in
his
headlong
charge
being
pierced
by
balls
the
carnage
was
so
frightful
that
the
onset
was
stayed
and
then
as
the
assailants
wavered
captain
ezekiel
slocumb
having
crossed
the
creek
with
his
company
rushed
from
the
woods
and
charged
their
flank
a
wild
panic
ensued
and
the
tories
fled
in
disorder
from
the
fatal
bridge
the
whigs
followed
in
hot
pursuit
and
the
victory
was
overwhelming
nearly
two
thousand
royalists
were
thus
defeated
by
eleven
hundred
undisciplined
whigs
eight
hundred
prisoners
including
general
mcdonald
with
all
the
camp
stores
were
taken
there
was
not
a
more
complete
victory
during
the
war
general
moore
strategy
was
brilliant
in
conception
and
daring
in
execution
but
no
strategy
however
brilliant
and
no
courage
however
daring
would
have
availed
anything
had
not
north
carolina
been
prepared
to
put
promptly
in
the
field
troops
with
the
necessary
munitions
of
war
these
troops
that
took
part
in
the
campaign
came
some
from
above
greensboro
in
the
west
and
others
below
new
bern
in
the
east
infantry
artillery
and
mounted
troops
were
all
engaged
and
everything
went
on
as
smoothly
as
if
the
province
had
never
known
anything
about
war
the
successful
conduct
of
the
campaign
requiring
as
it
did
the
rapid
concentration
of
troops
without
railroad
steamboat
or
telegraph
and
the
readiness
with
which
ninety
days
previous
we
had
sent
troops
both
to
south
carolina
and
to
virginia
demonstrated
beyond
question
the
wisdom
of
the
congress
in
its
work
at
hillsboro
during
the
summer
and
autumn
before
the
defeat
of
the
tories
thwarted
the
schemes
of
governor
martin
and
so
dispirited
the
scotch
and

years
elapsed

they
gave

into
the
cape

his
army
but
hearing
of
the
disaster
sailed
away
having
effected
nothing
but
an
inglorious
descent
upon
the
farm
of
general
robert

chapter
xxvii
fourth
provincial
congress
declares
independence
the
hillsboro
congress
of
august
formally
inaugurated
a
war
of
resistance
to
british
oppressions
but
to
the
halifax
congress
of
april
was
left
the
crowning
glory
of
being
the
first
in
all
the
colonies
to
declare
for
absolute
independence
of
the
mother
country
and
for
foreign
alliances
it
was
quickly
seen
when
the
new
congress
met
at
halifax
on
the
of
april
that
great
progress
had
been
made
in
public
sentiment
at
hillsboro
professions
of
loyalty
and
of
a
desire
for
continued
connection
with
great
britain
some
honest
but
many
of
questionable
sincerity
doubtless
were
still
to
be
heard
at
halifax
there
was
neither
halting
nor
hesitation
in
avowing
that
absolute
independence
from
the
mother
country
was
the
real
aim
of
the
people
of
the
province
the
time
for
the
final
plunge
had
come
and
north
carolina
was
quite
ready
for
it
accordingly
on
the
fourth
day
of
the
session
a
committee
was
appointed
to
take
into
consideration
the
usurpations
and
violences
attempted
and
committed
by
the
king
and
parliament
of
britain
against
america
and
the
further
measures
to
be
taken
for
frustrating
the
same
and
for
the
better
defence
of
the
province
four
days
later
that
is
to
say
on
the
day
of
april
a
day
ever
to
be
remembered
in
the
annals
of
america
the
committee
reported
as
follows
it
appears
to
your
committee
that
pursuant
to
the
plan
concerted
by
the
british
ministry
for
subjugating
america
the
king
and
parliament
of
great
britain
have
usurped
a
power
over
the
persons
and
properties
of
the
people
unlimited
and
uncontrolled
and
disregarding
their
humble
petitions
for
peace
liberty
and
safety
have
made
divers
legislative
acts
denouncing
war
famine
and
every
species
of
calamity
against
the
continent
in
general
that
british
fleets
and
armies
have
been
and
still
are
daily
employed
in
destroying
the
people
and
committing
the
most
horrid
devastations
on
the
country
that
governors
in
different
colonies
have
declared
protection
to
slaves
who
should
imbrue
their
hands
in
the
blood
of
their
masters
that
the
ships
belonging
to
america
are
declared
prizes
of
war
and
many
of
them
have
been
violently
seized
and
confiscated
in
consequence
of
which
multitudes
of
the
people
have
been
destroyed
or
from
easy
circumstances
reduced
to
the
most
lamentable
distress
and
whereas
the
moderation
hitherto
manifested
by
the
united
colonies
and
their
sincere
desire
to
be
reconciled
to
the
mother
country
on
constitutional
principles
have
procured
no
mitigation
of
the
aforesaid
wrongs
and
usurpations
and
no
hopes
remain
of
obtaining
redress
by
those
means
alone
which
have
been
hitherto
tried
your
committee
are
of
opinion
that
the
house
should
enter
into
the
following
resolve
to
wit
resolved
that
the
delegates
for
this
colony
in
the
continental
congress
be
empowered
to
concur
with
the
delegates
of
the
other
colonies
in
declaring
independence
and
forming
foreign
alliances
reserving
to
this
colony
the
sole
and
exclusive
right
of
forming
a
constitution
and
laws
for
this
colony
and
of
appointing
delegates
from
time
to
time
under
direction
of
a
general
representation
thereof
to
meet
the
delegates
of
the
other
colonies
for
such
purposes
as
shall
be
hereafter
pointed
out
and
thereupon
the
congress
did
so
resolve
unanimously
with
the
exception
of
the
mecklenburg
declaration
of
the
year
before
there
had
been
up
to
that
time
nowhere
in
all
america
a
single
organized
body
to
venture
on
such
a
proposition
individuals
like
samuel
adams
william
hooper
and
christopher
gadsden
had
been
heard
advocating
it
but
every
other
assembly
was
yet
protesting
its
loyalty
to
the
king
it
was
more
than
a
month
before
virginia
consented
to
patrick
henry
demands
and
the
other
colonies
were
to
follow
at
intervals
after
her
endorsement
in
the
annals
of
the
world
there
is
no
prouder
record
than
the
entry
made
on
the
journals
of
the
halifax
congress
on
the
day
of
april
a
great
fleet
and
army
were
yet
upon
the
soil
and
within
the
waters
of
north
carolina
but
this
could
not
deter
these
resolute
patriots
from
thus
taking
the
lead
in
a
doubtful
and
perilous
departure
from
all
the
ties
and
obligations
of
the
past
it
can
then
be
understood
how
joyously
the
news
was
received
at
this
same
town
of
halifax
on
july
that
the
continental
congress
at
philadelphia
had
acceded
to
the
wishes
of
north
carolina
and
had
on
the
day
of
the
same
month
declared
the
independence
of
america
the
council
of
safety
was
at
that
time
in
session
at
halifax
and
by
it
thursday
the
of
august
was
set
as
a
day
for
proclaiming
the
declaration
at
the
courthouse
in
halifax
and
the
people
were
invited
to
attend
on
the
day
appointed
according
to
the
vivid
description
of
an
a
vast
concourse
of
people
assembled
in
front
of
the
court
house
the
provincial
troops
and
the
militia
were
all
drawn
up
in
full
array
at
midday
cornelius
harnett
ascended
a
rostrum
that
had
been
erected
in
front
of
the
courthouse
and
even
as
he
opened
the
scroll
upon
which
was
written
the
immortal
words
of
the
declaration
the
enthusiasm
of
the
immense
crowd
broke
forth
in
one
loud
swell
of
rejoicing
and
prayer
when
he
had
finished
all
the
people
shouted
with
joy
and
the
cannon
sounding
from
fort
to
fort
proclaimed
the
glorious
tidings
that
all
the
thirteen
colonies
were
now
free
and
independent
states
the
soldiers
seized
harnett
and
bore
him
on
their
shoulders
through
the
town
the
declaration
was
ordered
to
be
read
in
all
portions
of
north
carolina
and
except
in
one
county
the
mandate
was
everywhere
obeyed
all
the
north
carolina
troops
then
in
arms
including
the
two
continental
regiments
and
the
militia
under
general
ashe
were
in
charleston
they
were
spectators
of
the
combat
in
which
the
gallant
moultrie
within
his
fort
of
palmetto
logs
signally
defeated
the
same
british
fleet
under
sir
peter
parker
that
had
been
so
recently
in
cape
fear
river
general
james
moore
marched
northward
from
charleston
with
his
brigade
but
died
in
wilmington
his

questions
what
is

was
it

condition
was

something
of
the
boldness
of
this
declaration

was
done
by
the
continental
congress
on
may
describe
the
reading
of
the
declaration
of
independence
where
were
the
north
carolina
soldiers
at
that
time
what
other
military
movements
were
mentioned
what
occurred
on
january
chapter
xxviii
adoption
of
a
state
constitution
after
the
public
avowal
by
the
people
of
north
carolina
through
their
newly
organized
congress
at
halifax
in
april
of
a
fixed
purpose
to
secure
by
force
of
arms
absolute
independence
from
the
mother
country
and
of
her
desire
to
enter
into
foreign
alliances
to
accomplish
that
end
there
was
no
reason
for
any
longer
delay
in
establishing
a
permanent
form
of
government
for
the
colony
hitherto
pride
of
consistency
in
form
at
least
to
say
nothing
of
a
considerate
regard
for
tender
consciences
if
not
for
weak
nerves
might
well
have
held
them
back
after
the
action
of
the
congress
on
the
of
april
however
it
was
manifest
that
the
day
of
provisional
government
was
nigh
its
close
and
that
the
people
of
north
carolina
must
abide
the
arbitrament
of
war
to
which
they
had
appealed
whether
in
future
they
should
be
free
citizens
or
dependent
subjects
of
a
foreign
government
the
ground
and
the
time
for
temporary
expedients
were
both
left
behind
in
north
carolina
on
the
of
april
there
was
great
division
however
among
the
wisest
and
best
men
in
the
province
as
to
the
true
nature
of
the
new
system
of
government
which
had
thus
become
necessary
samuel
johnston
was
a
wise
and
patriotic
leader
he
was
a
man
of
wealth
and
experience
in
public
affairs
and
was
devoted
to
his
country
but
he
thought
that
new
experiments
in
government
were
dangerous
and
withal
was
long
very
much
averse
to
a
final
separation
from
great
britain
he
wished
to
keep
up
the
old
system
of
rule
as
far
as
possible
among
other
reasons
because
he
doubted
the
ability
of
the
people
to
govern
themselves
these
views
were
also
held
by
general
allen
jones
of
northampton
and
other
prominent
men
on
the
other
hand
willie
jones
of
halifax
brother
of
general
allen
jones
was
the
leader
of
a
majority
of
the
legislators
and
the
people
he
held
as
the
fundamental
article
of
his
political
creed
that
the
american
people
were
capable
of
governing
themselves
and
that
all
political
power
belonged
to
and
proceeded
from
them
like
jefferson
of
virginia
he
advocated
religious
freedom
separation
of
church
and
state
liberty
of
the
press
and
choice
of
rulers
by
the
masses
at
the
between
these
two
champions
of
opposing
theories
stood
richard
caswell
a
man
of
excellent
discretion
and
great
practical
common
sense
who
happily
tempering
the
fierce
democracy
of
jones
with
the
more
cautious
conservatism
of
johnston
possessed
in
a
rare
degree
the
confidence
of
the
people
of
north
carolina
of
every
faction
a
marylander
by
birth
he
came
to
north
carolina
when
quite
a
youth
without
fortune
or
friends
and
won
his
unbounded
popularity
by
long
years
of
unselfish
unstinted
devotion
to
her
service
men
of
strong
convictions
especially
when
accustomed
to
shape
public
sentiment
do
not
readily
yield
to
opposing
views
and
it
was
a
happy
thing
for
north
carolina
that
she
possessed
such
a
man
as
caswell
whose
commanding
influence
enabled
him
to
control
and
finally
to
compose
the
fierce
differences
that
prevailed
in
regard
to
the
character
of
the
proposed
new
government
at
his
suggestion
the
matter
was
postponed
until
the
winter
when
a
new
congress
would
be
in
session
fresh
from
the
people
and
in
full
possession
of
their
views
in
the
premises
and
in
this
way
the
question
at
issue
as
to
the
character
of
the
new
government
was
remitted
directly
to
the
decision
of
the
people
by
formal
resolution
adopted
on
the
of
august
the
council
of
safety
called
the
attention
of
the
people
to
the
fact
that
the
next
congress
would
frame
a
constitution
for
the
state
and
urged
for
that
reason
that
the
greatest
care
be
taken
in
the
selection
of
delegates
at
the
ensuing
election
the
election
was
held
on
the
day
of
october
and
the
congress
met
at
halifax
on
the
day
of
november
and
on
motion
of
allen
jones
made
richard
caswell
its
president
samuel
johnston
after
a
hot
contest
had
failed
to
be
elected
and
was
consequently
not
a
member
he
was
in
halifax
however
during
the
sitting
of
the
congress
and
doubtless
exercised
but
little
less
influence
than
he
would
have
done
had
he
been
a
delegate
on
the
of
december
that
most
admirable
enunciation
of
human
rights
the
bill
of
rights
was
adopted
and
the
next
day
the
constitution
was
adopted
the
new
constitution
went
into
operation
at
once
with
caswell
as
the
first
governor
and
the
great
work
of
supplying
the
state
with
judges
sheriffs
magistrates
and
other
officers
began
for
several
years
there
had
been
no
courts
to
administer
justice
either
civil
or
criminal
except
military
tribunals
and
the
various
committees
of
safety
fortunately
while
governor
caswell
aided
by
the
legislative
authorities
was
putting
in
motion
the
untried
machinery
of
a
new
government
and
evoking
civil
order
from
military
disorder
our
british
foes
were
far

the

continued
to
all
of
the
north
carolina
continentals
were
with
general
washington
early
in
the
new
year
they
reached
him
in
a
great
emergency
his
army
had
just
been
driven
from
new
york
across
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
such
had
been
his
losses
by
battle
and
otherwise
that
when
he
reached
the
delaware
river
he
could
hardly
muster
five
thousand
men
sir
william
howe
the
british
had
nine
thousand
trained
soldiers
available
and
when
lord
cornwallis
who
had
been
pursuing
the
americans
was
halted
by
him
it
was
the
salvation
of
the
force
left
with
general
washington
had
sir
william
forborne
to
stop
the
pursuit
of
cornwallis
the
struggle
might
have
soon
ended
in
the
capture
of
washington
after
a
week
of
delay
cornwallis
was
permitted
to
advance
and
even
then
came
up
in
time
to
see
the
last
boatloads
of
the
american
troops
crossing
the
great
river
which
so
effectually
stopped
all
further
pursuit
when
general
nash
arrived
at
the
american
camp
after
his
long
march
from
the
south
he
brought
six
full
regiments
of
north
carolina
continentals
nearly
doubling
the
force
upon
which
the
hopes
of
america
mainly
depended
by
this
means
general
washington
was
soon
after
able
to
confront
the
advancing
enemy
in
the
battle
of
brandywine
on
september
at
this
and
other
engagements
the
north
carolina
troops
displayed
both
courage
and
discipline
it
was
on
the
bloody
occasion
of
the
attack
upon
the
british
force
at
germanton
october
that
their
most
glorious
record
was
made
general
washington
entrusted
the
post
of
honor
on
the
extreme
right
flank
of
his
line
of
attack
to
general
francis
nash
the
british
were
driven
by
the
north
carolinians
a
long
distance
on
the
right
of
the
village
but
the
american
divisions
which
had
been
sent
in
on
the
left
failed
to
dislodge
the
enemy
and
in
this
way
left
general
nash
force
exposed
both
on
his
left
and
rear
it
was
a
glorious
but
bloody
day
for
north

the
brigade
suffered
heavy
loss
in
advancing
but
greater
when
compelled
to
fall
back
for
want
of

general
nash
and

were
mortally
wounded
colonel
irwin
and
many

gallant
officers
were
slain
upon

forces
were

general
robert
howe
was
driven

was
busy
in

for
treason
against

there
were
many
men
who
yet
labored
to
restore
the
king
authority
and
against
them
was
needed
all
the
vigilance
possible
both
in
the
courts
and
at
military
headquarters
more
than
three
years
of
the
war
had
passed
away
without
serious
disaster
to
north
carolina
no
invaders
disturbed
her
borders
and
beyond
the
grief
for
friends
slain
in
battle
there
was
cause
for
gratitude
to
god
that
so
few
evils
of
the
war
had
yet
visited
the
state
general
washington
had
evinced
such
nobility
of
soul
and
great
military
capacity
that
all
american
hearts
were
soon
filled
with
love
and
admiration
with
wisdom
he
was
patiently
biding
his
time
to
strike
his
enemies
and
in
foreign
lands
other
great
soldiers
were
applauding
the
mingled
caution
and
boldness
of

can
you
tell
something
of

chapter

stony
point
and
charleston
to
the
capture
of
savannah
caused
uneasiness
in
all
the
southern
states
it
was
seen
at
once
that
georgia
was
but
a
starting
point
in
a
general
scheme
of
transferring
hostilities
from
the
north
early
in
general
john
ashe
reached
charleston
with
two
or
more
brigades
of
militia
these
were
hurried
off
at
the
importunate
demand
of
the
governor
of
south
carolina
to
attack
the
british
at
augusta
general
ashe
remonstrated
saying
his
men
were
not
yet
ready
for
active
service
in
the
field
he
obeyed
orders
however
and
took
the
field
as
directed
on
his
approach
the
enemy
retired
down
the
savannah
river
and
ashe
dividing
his
force
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
fall
into
an
ambush
on
brier
creek
where
his
men
who
were
raw
undisciplined
troops
were
taken
by
surprise
and
routed
a
little
later
and
elsewhere
there
was
better
fortune
at
stony
point
on
the
hudson
river
a
strong
american
fortification
had
been
recently
captured
by
the
british
general
wayne
found
that
it
was
garrisoned
by
six
hundred
scotch
highlanders
constituting
one
of
the
regular
royal
regiments
the
work
was
nearly
surrounded
by
the
river
and
by
morasses
and
the
single
approach
was
so
swept
by
the
guns
of
the
work
and
also
by
those
of
several
lying
close
by
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
in
its
defence
that
it
seemed
wellnigh
hopeless
to
attempt
its
capture
but
hopeless
as
it
seemed
general
wayne
determined
to
make
the
attempt
he
drew
near
at
midnight
and
with
unloaded
muskets
and
courage
that
has
never
been
surpassed
captured
the
stronghold
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
two
columns
of
assault
were
sent
in
on
the
right
and
left
but
to
major
hardy
murfree
two
companies
of
the
second
north
carolina
continental
regiment
as
a
forlorn
hope
was
the
post
of
real
honor
and
danger
assigned
they
charged
full
in
front
up
the
steep
hillside
through
several
lines
of
abattis
and
in
this
way
received
the
hottest
of
the
enemy
fire
the
capture
of
the
fort
was
largely
due
to
the
gallantry
of
the
north
carolina
troops
governor
caswell
being
ineligible
for
the
next
term
was
succeeded
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
by
abner
nash
as
chief
magistrate
of
north
carolina
the
constitution
provided
that
after
three
years
service
the
executive
became
ineligible
for
the
next
term
and
caswell
had
served
three
terms
governor
nash
like
his
predecessor
was
a
man
of
ability
and
patriotism
but
did
not
equal
him
in
the
versatility
of
his
powers
or
his
consummate
skill
in
the
management
of
men
in
february
all
of
the
north
carolina
troops
of
the
continental
line
had
been
ordered
to
the
south
they
were
at
charleston
with
general
lincoln
being
besieged
there
by
an
overwhelming
force
under
sir
henry
clinton
in
addition
to
the
army
the
british
commander
had
come
down
from
new
york
with
a
great
fleet
the
defence
was
a
brave
one
but
unavailing
and
on
may
general
lincoln
was
forced
to
surrender
it
was
a
direful
day
for
north
carolina
all
of
her
regular
troops
and
a
full
thousand
of
her
militia
became
prisoners
of
war
it
was
a
fatal
rashness
in
general
lincoln
to
allow
himself
to
be
cooped
up
in
a
city
thus
while
no
real
benefit
resulted
to
the
american
cause
or
to
the
state
of
south
carolina
north
carolina
was
at
one
fell
blow
stripped
of
all
her
defenders
sir
henry
clinton
sailed
back
to
new
york
after
the
capitulation
but
he
left
a
man
of
far
superior
ability
with
an
army
to
continue
the
conquest
of
south
carolina
this
was
lord
cornwallis
who
was
the
bravest
and
most
skillful
british
soldier
then
in
the
world
he
was
to
remain
this
time
long
enough
to
be
forever
remembered
and
to
take
bloody
vengeance
for
his
inglorious
experience
with
sir
peter
parker
four
years
before
the
first
movement
of
cornwallis
after
capturing
charleston
was
to
send
tarleton
with
his
dragoons
to
intercept
a
column
of
infantry
which
was
approaching
from
virginia
under
the
command
of
colonel
buford
these
were
surprised
and
cut
to
pieces
among
others
the
north
carolina
company
of
captain
john
stokes
lost
heavily
in
the
sudden
and
bloody
attack
this
disaster
occurred
in
the
waxhaw
settlement
on
the
state
line
not
far
from
charlotte
in
north
carolina
thus
at
a
time
when
everything
indicated
another
invasion
not
a
single
troop
of
disciplined
soldiers
was
left
for
the
defence
of
this
state
except
the
two
companies
of
mounted
infantry
which
were
commanded
by
the
gallant
major
william
davie
this
little
band
hovered
continually
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
scene
of
colonel

court
house
when
the
great
disaster
at
charleston
became
known
to
the
north
carolina
tories
and
they
fully
realized
that
british
troops
were
close
at
hand
the
spirit
that
had
seemed
crushed
at
creek
began
to
revive
they
had
suffered
indignities
from
the
whigs
on
account
of
their
support
of
the
king
and
they
now
determined
on
swift
and
bloody
revenge
john
moore
who
was
in
hamilton
regiment
returned
to
his
former
residence
in
lincoln
county
and
assembled
early
in
june
thirteen
hundred
royalists
at
ramsour
mill
general
rutherford
hearing
of
this
in
his
camp
near
the
waxhaws
thought
it
impolitic
to
leave
that
position
because
of
a
threatened
movement
of
the
british
then
in
his
front
he
therefore
sent
orders
to
colonel
francis
locke
of
rowan
to
assemble
his
militia
and
at
once
attack
the
tories
no
command
was
ever
more
promptly
or
bravely
obeyed
locke
mustered
four
hundred
of
his
neighbors
and
went
through
the
darkness
of
the
night
in
search
of
foes
outnumbering
him
threefold
at
early
dawn
on
the
with
mounted
men
in
front
he
charged
boldly
upon
the
tory
camp
that
was
pitched
near
ramsour
mill
in
sight
of
the
present
village
of
lincolnton
the
royalists
fled
at
the
first
charge
but
rallied
on
a
hill
and
checked
the
horsemen
in
pursuit
the
whigs
on
foot
came
to
the
rescue
and
drove
the
royalists
routed
from
the
field
this
brilliant
victory
was
at
that
fearful
juncture
it
was
a
bloody
and
heroic
affair
and
was
a
timely
foretaste
of
the
spirit
of
the
brave
men
of
the
west
it
was
a
struggle
between
neighbors
and
old
friends
and
carried
bitterness
and
sorrow
to
many
north
carolina
firesides
major
davie
with
his
small
command
commenced
a
series
of
daring
adventures
which
gave
him
great
reputation
for
bravery
and
military
skill
at
flat
rock
and
also
at
hanging
rock
in
south
carolina
he
inflicted
such
stunning
blows
that
legion
learned
to
be
very
cautious
of
a
foe
so
daring
and
so
wary
colonel
isaac
shelby
also
distinguished
himself
at
musgrove
mill
thus
the
militia
of
north
carolina
assumed
the
defence
of
their
homes
and
inflicted
such
frequent
and
telling
blows
upon
the
enemy
that
lord
cornwallis
halted
at
camden
to
receive
further
reinforcements
before
venturing
to
enter
a
state
whose
undrilled
had
shown
themselves
so
formidable
upon
the
fall
of

general
horatio
gates
had
been
put
in
command
in
the
south
in
place
of
general
lincoln
his
success
at
saratoga
had
given
him
great
popularity
and
some
misguided
men
were
advocating
his
advancement
even
to
the
place
of
general
washington
a
short
time
exposed
the
folly
of
all
such
views
he
was
at
best
but
a
martinet
who
had
learned
something
of
military
routine
in
the
camps
but
was
as
devoid
of
real
ability
as
he
was
vain
and
rash
he
came
to
deep
river
on
july
where
in
camp
he
found
one
delaware
and
two
maryland
battalions
of
continentals
colonel
armand
and
three
companies
of
artillery
under
the
command
of
the
baron
dekalb
learning
that
general
caswell
had
a
considerable
militia
force
at
cheraw
in
south

he
started
two
days
later
for
the
neighborhood
of
lord
cornwallis
and
his
army
at
camden
he
reached
cheraw
with
some
additional
troops
that
had
joined
him
on
the
march
on
august
taking
a
large
portion
of
caswell
militia
he
set
out
with
the
purpose
of
surprising

colonel
armand
was
marching
in
front
when
at
midnight
his
dragoons
recoiled
from
an
unexpected
meeting
with
the
british
vanguard
the
collision
was
unexpected
on
both
sides
and
threw
general
gates
column
into
disorder
his
officers
vainly
besought
him
to
retreat
as
the
veteran
forces
of
the
enemy
had
not
been
surprised
both
sides
halted
and
prepared
for
battle
at
dawn
lord
cornwallis
sent
his
regulars
with
fixed
bayonets
to
attack
the
militia
on
the
right
and
these
untrained
troops
unable
to
withstand
so
fierce
an
onset
from
regular
veteran
soldiers
abandoned
the
field
colonel
henry
dickson
held
his

militia
firmly
to
the
front
and
with
the
continental
or
regular
troops
they
offered
a
stubborn
and
gallant
defence
but
the
flight
of
so
many
made
it
necessary
to
withdraw
the
few
who
thus
gallantly
stood
their
ground
the
american
defeat
was
complete
two
thousand
men
were
killed
wounded
and
captured
all
the

lost
general
gates
fled
early
in
the
action
and
spurred
on
without
stopping
to
hillsboro
in
this
state
his
defeat
nearly
ruined
the
american
cause
in
the
south
and
his
reputation
as
a
military
leader
received
a
severe
blow
note
the
capture
of

at

was
one
of
the
most
deplorable

the
spirit
of

people
was
high
and
they
did
not
for
a
moment
relax
their
efforts
for
the
support

five

camp
at

he
sent
colonel
patrick
ferguson
toward
the
scene
of
the
late
tory
defeat
at
ramsour
mill
this
colonel
ferguson
was
one
of
the
ablest
officers
in
the
british
army
he
was
cool
daring
and
well
skilled
in
everything
relating
to
the
conduct
of
military
affairs
he
could
command
men
in
camp
and
in

and
excelled
all
others
in
arousing
the
spirit
of
the
tories
he
induced
hundreds
of
men
to
take
sides
with
the
king
when
another
would
have
failed
as
lord
cornwallis
marched
upon
north

colonel

hung
upon

front
and
fell
back
only
as
compelled
by
the
advance
of
the
british
he
made
but
one
dash
against
his
pursuers
before
reaching
charlotte
but
on
arriving
there
he
and
major
joseph
graham
halted
under
the
courthouse
in
the
middle
of
the
village
and
surprised
cornwallis
and
the
whole
british
army
by
a
resistance
so
bloody
and
stubborn
as
to
prove
the
right
of
that
place
to
the
name
of
hornet
nest
which
cornwallis
bestowed
upon
it
note
davie
whole
force
did
not
number
more
than
two
hundred
men
and
yet
so
cool
and
bravely
did
they
meet
the
british
assault
that
the
enemy
was
several
times
driven
back
major
graham
was
at
that
time
just
years
old
and
he
exhibited
such
courage
and
conduct
as
have
never
been
excelled
in
one
attack
upon
him
he
received
nine
wounds
and
was
left
for
dead
on
the
field
but
made
his
escape
the
english
commander
was
so
harassed
by
the
daring
attacks
of
the
militia
upon
his
men
at
mcintyre
farm
and
elsewhere
in
that
neighborhood
that
he
concluded
to
remain
at
charlotte
until
he
could
hear
from
colonel
ferguson
that
officer
had
halted
at
a
place
called
gilberttown
where
his
one
hundred
and
fifty
british
regulars
were
soon
reinforced
by
large
numbers
of
native
royalists
who
came
to
the
english
flag
to
take
service
in
its
behalf
colonel
charles
mcdowell
and
others
hearing
that
ferguson
was
enrolling
the
tories
met
at
watauga
and
took
counsel
against
him
no
general
was
present
and
mcdowell
was
so
old
they
feared
he
would
be
unable
to
endure
the
probable
hard
marching
necessary
to
overtake
their
wily
foe
colonel
campbell
of
virginia
as
a
courtesy
to
one
belonging
outside
of
the
state
was
put
in
command
by
the
north
carolina
officers
and
they
set
out
with
about
eleven
hundred
men
to
look
for
the
enemy
colonels
shelby
sevier
cleveland
and
major
joseph
mcdowell
of
north
carolina
together
with
colonel
williams
of
south
carolina
selected
nine
hundred
picked
men
from
their
mounted
force
and
through
the
stormy
thirty
hours
of
their
march
kept
their
saddles
until
on
the
morning
of
the
of
october
they
found
the
foe
with
eleven
hundred
and
men
on
the
summit
of
king
mountain
it
was
a
strong
position
but
the
heroic
mountaineers
at
once
surrounded
it
and
began
the
attack
ferguson
fought
like
a
lion
at
bay
but
the
deadly
rifles
of
the
assailants
were
plied
upon
his
ranks
as
the
royalists
were
pushed
back
step
by
step
time
and
again
the
british
commander
headed
the
regulars
and
by
desperate
charges
down
the
mountain
side
drove
back
a
portion
of
the
advancing
whig
lines
at
last
ferguson
was
slain
after
being
many
times
wounded
and
soon
the
british
fire
slackened
and
then
to
the
nine
hundred
militiamen
of
the
hills
the
remnant
of
the
royalists
laid
down
their
guns
six
hundred
men
became
prisoners
of
war
this
was
a
bloody
but
a
glorious
victory
the
number
of
british
dead
was
unusually
great
their
proportion
of
wounded
was
perhaps
smaller
than
was
ever
seen
in
a
modern
battle
the
whigs
lost
three
field
officers
one
captain
and
privates
it
was
a
most
opportune
success
and
apprised
lord
cornwallis
of
what
dangers
might
await
his
further
advance
he
became
so
disheartened
upon
learning
of
the
disaster
that
he
at
once
fell
back
to
winnsboro
in
south
carolina
north
carolina
was
again
free
from
invaders
and
the
tories
of
every
section
felt
their
hopes
sink
as
they
realized
the
swiftness
and
completeness
of
this
overthrow
every
patriot
heart
however
once
more
beat
with
hope
and
joy
the
victory
of
king
mountain
was
the
turning
point
of
the
war
in
the
south
and
foreshadowed
the
final
success
of
the
american
armies
in
the
following
year
the
arrival
of
general
nathaniel
greene
who
now
took
command
of
the
southern
army
in
place
of
general
gates
secured
every
advantage
of
the
situation
he
was
from
rhode
island
and
had
been
a
blacksmith
but
was
a
man
of
rare
military
genius
and
as
such
had
been
singled
out
by
general
washington
to
occupy
an
important
place
general
greene
soon
proved
himself
a
great
commander
he
was
gentle
unselfish
and
true
and
loved
the
cause
for
which
he
fought
better
than
his
own
life
he
was
brave
cautious
and
quick
to
seize
upon
all
the
faults
of
his
opponent
he
could
patiently
wait
until
battle
was
proper

apparent
defeat

general
greene
soon
became

that

great
trouble
would
be
in
obtaining
food
in
sufficient
quantities
to
feed
an
army
large
enough
to
meet
the
british
in
open
field
generals
gregory
and
jones
were
ordered
back
to
their
homes
and
their
brigades
were
disbanded
because
of
this
poverty
of
resources
in
that
section
of
the
country
general
morgan
was
sent
west
of
the
catawba
river
another
camp
was
established
at

and

and
mecklenburg
under
general
davidson
were
allowed
to
await
at
their
homes
for
any
call
that
might
become
necessary
such
was
the
state
of
affairs
in
general
greene
command
when
lord
cornwallis
was
reinforced
by
the
arrival
of
another
division
of
troops
under
the
command
of
major
general
leslie
on
january
tarleton
with
his
famous
legion
and
the
first
battalion
of
the
regiment
assailed
general
morgan
at
cowpens
these
men
had
so
often
cut
to
pieces
such
american
forces
that
they
expected
an
easy
victory
on
this
occasion
they
were
received
by
the
americans
with
the
utmost
coolness
and
their
deadly
fire
emptied
so
many
british
saddles
that
the
boldest
riders
were
thrown
into
confusion
like
a
thunderbolt
then
came
a
charge
of
the
american
lighthorse
under
william
washington
they
rode
down
and
sabred
the
terrified
britons
chasing
them
many
miles
from
the
field
in
less
than
an
hour
the
eleven
hundred
british
were
so
thoroughly
routed
that
they
lost
five
hundred
and
two
prisoners
three
hundred
killed
and
wounded
with
all
their
artillery
and
stores
general
morgan
had
but
eight
hundred
men
and
though
flushed
with
victory
he
remembered
that
the
main
army
of
the
enemy
was
at
turkey
creek
only
miles
away
he
therefore
prudently
burned
his
captured
stores
and
leaving
his
and
the
enemy
wounded
under
protection
of
a
flag
at
once
began
his
retreat
through
north
carolina
he
well
knew
that
lord
cornwallis
would
be
enraged
at
tarleton
disaster
and
would
seek
the
recapture
of
his
prisoners
during
twelve
days
the
victors
fled
from
the
scene
of
their
glory
while
the
british
were
pushing
on
close
behind
them
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
as
the
day
was
closing
in
and
general
morgan
had
just
safely
crossed
the
catawba
river
at
the
island
ford
he
looked
back
and
saw
the
british
vanguard
on
the
other
bank
of
the
stream
the
exultant
pursuers
had
overcome
the
miles
of
start
and
feeling
sure
of
their
prey
they
encamped
that
night
with
the
utmost
confidence
that
on
the
next
day
they
could
easily
overtake
the
fugitives
but
they
were
doomed
to
disappointment
soon
a
heavy
rain
began
falling
and
when
the
night
was
past
the
river
had
become
a
great
and
impassable
flood
the
baffled
foe
was
compelled
to
halt
for
the
passage
of
the
stream
was
impossible
the
high
water
remained
in
the
river
for
hours
during
which
time
the
british
were
unable
to
effect
a
crossing
general
morgan
sent
his
militia
with
the
prisoners
on
to
virginia
and
with
his
continentals
kept
down
the
left
bank
of
the
river
and
joined
general
greene
at
ford
there
they
unhappily
disagreed
as
to
future
operations
and
general
morgan
left
the
service
during
the
two
days
that
lord
cornwallis
was
stopped
by
the
rise
in
the
catawba
river
general
greene
made
arrangements
to
dispute
its
passage
this
was
attempted
at
cowan
ford
and
the
british
after
some
loss
forced
a
passage
unfortunately
brave
general
davidson
who
was
in
command
of
the
militia
was
killed
and
upon
his
fall
his
men
retreated
from
the
field
they
were
surprised
by
tarleton
at
torrence
tavern
six
miles
away
in
the
direction
of
salisbury
the
chase
was
now
renewed
and
general
greene
was
again
in
great
danger
when
he
reached
salisbury
he
was
so
dejected
at
the
condition
of
affairs
that
a
good
woman
named
elizabeth
steele
sought
to
cheer
him
by
words
of
hope
he
explained
to
her
his
almost
desperate
condition
and
that
though
in
command
of
the
southern
army
he
was
wholly
without
friends
and
without
money
she
generously
pressed
upon
him
a
purse
of
gold
and
with
hope
revived
by
such
an
exhibition
of
womanly
sympathy
and
generous
patriotism
he
resumed
his
retreat
a
rise
in
the
waters
of
the
yadkin
river
after
the
americans
had
crossed
repeated
the
scenes
witnessed
on
the
catawba
and
thus
while
general
greene
was
enabled
to
reach
the
forces
from
cheraw
that
had
been
ordered
to
meet
him
at
guilford
court
house
lord
cornwallis
was
compelled
to
make
a
wide
detour
up
the
river
to
get
across
again
in
a
few
days
the
americans
still
retreating
found
their
enemies
once
more
close
up
in
the
rear
for
several
days
on
long
stretches
in
the
road
the
two
armies
could
see
each
other
general
greene
was
so
hotly
pursued
that
he
found
it
necessary
to
check
the
enemy
in
some
way
and
the
gallant
colonel
otho
williams
of
maryland
with
a
corps
of
light
troops
numbering
seven
hundred
men
was
detailed
to
cover
the
retreat
this
detachment
most
faithfully
performed
its
duty
taking
but
one
meal
each
day
and
six
hours
sleep
in
they
retarded
the
progress
of
the
enemy
so
much
by
frequent
collisions
that
greene
was
enabled
to
considerably
increase
the
distance
between
the
two
armies
note
while
general
greene
was
in
the
house
of
steele
at
salisbury
he
caught
sight
of
a
picture
of
king
george
iii
hanging
upon
the
wall
the
picture
recalled
many
unpleasant
memories
and
hardships
to
the
general
he
took
it
from
the
wall
and
with
a
piece
of
chalk
wrote
upon
the
back
o
george
hide
thy
face
and
mourn
he
then
replaced
the
picture
with
its
face
to
the
wall
and
rode
away
this
picture
with
the
writing
on
the
back
still
visible
is
now
thought
to
be
in
the
possession
of
mrs
governor
swain
rumple
history
of
rowan
at
last
on
february
dan
river
was
reached
and
lord
cornwallis
came
up
only
in
time
to
see
the
last
boatloads
of
the
americans
safely
landing
on
the
other
side
of
the
wide
stream
which
was
too
deep
for
the
british
to
ford
thus
ended
this
famous
retreat
extending
more
than
two
hundred
miles
it
gave
general
greene
great
reputation
and
the
struggling
americans
took
fresh
heart
for
they
knew
they
had
at
last
a
general
in

could
provide
wisely
and
well

dangers

found

was
completely
beyond

he
marched
to

and
there
erected
the
royal

in

proclamations
and
the

supposing

drew
near
uttering
cheers
for

george
suddenly
the
bugles
of
the
lighthorse
sounded
a
charge
and
pyle
and
his
men
were
furiously
assailed
in
five
minutes
ninety
lay
dead
upon
the
ground
and
nearly
all
the
others
were
prisoners
of

this
bloody

match
major
joseph
graham
with
his

had
just

captured
a

of
men
a
mile
and
a
half
away
from

general
polk
militia
were
also
in
the

and
soon
general
greene
having
received
reinforcements
recrossed
the
dan
and
assumed
a
position
on
the
reedy
fork
a
confluent
of
haw
river
cornwallis
hearing
of
pyle
disaster
left
hillsboro
and
moved
westward
to
protect
any
tories
that
might
seek
to
reach
him
the
first
time
the
two
armies
again
saw
anything
of
each
other
was
at
whitsell
mill
at
that
place
colonel
otho
williams
was
posted
with
a
body
of
light
troops
which
lord
cornwallis
attempted
to
cut
off
from
the
main
body
he
failed
in
so
doing
but
both
armies
were
filled
with
admiration
at
a
display
of
personal
gallantry
colonel
williams
had
posted
sharpshooters
in
and
around
the
millhouse
these
discovered
a
british
officer
approaching
a
ford
below
them
and
saw
that
he
was
leading
men
and
trying
to
cross
the
stream
many
deadly
rifles
were
soon
hurling
their
missiles
around
him
but
slowly
and
as
if
unconscious
of
being
under
fire
he
crossed
in
safety
this
intrepid
man
was
colonel
william
webster
then
a
brigade
commander
under
cornwallis
on
march
general
greene
being
at
the
courthouse
of
guilford
county
learned
that
the
british
army
was
approaching
on
the
salisbury
road
he
hosted
his
men
in
three
lines
and
awaited
the
enemy
arrival
who
came
on
in
fine
style
but
the
first
american
line
composed
of
militia
giving
ground
only
the
men
of
the
gallant
captain
forbis
of
the
hawfields
gained
credit
for
their
conduct
the
british
found
stubborn
resistance
in
the
second
and
third
lines
where
the
continentals
were
posted
it
was
a
furious
and
bloody
conflict
and
such
havoc
was
wrought
in
the
british
ranks
by
a
charge
of
colonels
howard
and
washington
that
lord
cornwallis
opened
fire
with
his
artillery
upon
his
friends
and
foes
alike
and
thus
checked
this
dangerous
american
movement
general
greene
at
length
gave
orders
for
retreat
and
the
field
was
left
in
the
possession
of
the
british
british
valor
was
never
more
splendidly
exhibited
than
upon
this
field
with
less
than
half
of
greene
force
they
won
the
field
but
the
victory
was
too
costly
at
least
fourth
of
the
british
force
was
dead
and
disabled
including
the
gallant
webster
the
hero
of
whitsell
mill

was
flying
towards

who
had
so
long
sought
to
bring
on
an
engagement
was
now
the
fugitive

in
pursuit
but
failing
to
overtake
his
foe
he
turned
his
course
and
marched
against
lord
rawdon
in
south
carolina
he
had
redeemed
north
carolina
from
the
grasp
of
her
foes
and
went
to
confer
upon
the
two
other
southern

a
similar
blessing
no
more
british
armies
were
to
bring
ruin
and

left

about

hundred
regulars
and
some
tory
recruits
which
constituted
the
garrison
of

major
james
craig
was
in
command
there
having
captured
the
place
in
the
preceding
january
he
had
been
trained
to
arms
and
when
general
burgoyne
surrendered
at
saratoga
was
his
he
was
skillful
as
a
soldier
but
utterly
unscrupulous
as
to
the
means
he
used
to
carry
out
his
objects
seeing
the
british
driven
from
almost
all
the
state
he
determined
to
ruin
a
people
he
could
not
subdue
and
began
to
stir
up
a
warfare
of
neighborhoods
he
found
in
david
fanning
of
chatham
county
a
powerful
aid
in
his
inhuman
scheme
fanning
was
a
man
of
low
birth
ignorant
and
unscrupulous
he
was
a
good
partisan
guerrilla
leader
being
brave
enterprising
and
swift
to
execute
associating
with
himself
a
small
band
of
tories
whose
sole
objects
were
plunder
and
revenge
he
was
for
a
time
the
terror
of
chatham
and
orange
counties
well
mounted
and
well
armed
and
continually
on
the
alert
these
marauders
made
havoc
of
the
whig
settlements
murdering
burning
and
destroying
unrestrained
by
any
authority
and
with
no
sense
of
humanity
they
did
not
spare
even
their
own
neighbors
many
of
whom
they
shot
down
or
hanged
at
their
own
doors
many
stories
are
told
of
fanning
exploits
of
his
audacity
his
cruelty
his
arrogance
and
his
wonderful
successes
and
hairbreadth
escapes
such
a
state
of
affairs
existed
at
one
time
in
the
counties
ravaged
by
his
band
that
even
the
pitiless
colonel
tarleton
deplored
its
continuance
fanning
was
born
in
johnston
county
about
the
year
and
was
the
vilest
and
bloodiest
wretch
ever
seen
in
our
limits
most
richly
deserving
the
punishment
of
the
gallows
he
continued
his
criminal
courses
as
long
as
he
lived
and
was
pardoned
for
a
capital
felony
committed
on
the
island
of
cape
breton
not
long
before
his
departure
from
this
world
fanning
began
his
military
operations
by
surprising
a
courtmartial
in
chatham
his
prisoners
were
disposed
of
by
parole
or
sent
to
wilmington
this
was
in
july
his
attack
upon
the
house
of
colonel
philip
alston
a
few
days
later
was
a
more
serious
matter
for
he
encountered
stubborn
resistance
and
some
loss
before
compelling
the
surrender
of
a
force
almost
as
large
as
his
own
and
protected
by
the
walls
of
a
large
house
four
of
the
whigs
were
killed
and
those
who
remained
alive
were
spared
from
butchery
by
fanning
only
at
the
earnest
appeals
of
alston
fanning
movements
called
for
resistance
and
colonel
thomas
wade
collected
a
force
of
more
than
three
hundred
men
at
mcfall
mill
in
cumberland
county
these
were
speedily
attacked
and
utterly
driven
from
that
portion
of
the
country
it
was
afterwards
learned
by
the
victors
that
colonel
chatham
regiment
of
cavalry
was
disbanded
and
fanning
immediately
pushed
on
to
hillsboro
on
the
morning
of
september
his
force
entered
the
town
and
succeeded
in
capturing
governor
burke
and
several
other
prominent
persons
fanning
gives
the
account
of
this
affair
as
follows
we
received
several
shots
from
different
houses
however
we
lost
none
and
suffered
no
damage
except
one
man
wounded
we
killed
fifteen
of
the
rebels
and
wounded
twenty
and
took
upwards
of
two
hundred
prisoners
amongst
them
was
the
governor
his
council
and
part
of
the
continental
colonels
several
captains
and
subalterns
and
continental
soldiers
out
of
a
church
we
proceeded
to
the
gaol
and
released
thirty
loyalists
and
british
soldiers
the
bold
marauders
who
had
thus
seized
the
governor
and
capital
of
the
state
at
once
started
with
their
prisoners
for
wilmington
but
tidings
of
this
exploit
had
reached
a
body
of
men
who
hastened
to
lindley
mill
on
cane
creek
to
receive
them
the
whigs
nominally
commanded
by
general
john
butler
were
really
directed
by
major
robert
mebane
in
their
brave
and
bloody
reception
of
the
tories
the
tory
colonel
hector
mcneil
leading
the
attack
was
slain
and
his
followers
driven
back
in
confusion
it
seemed
that
governor
burke
would
be
rescued
and
the
whole
tory
column
captured
when
fanning
ever
fertile
in
expedients
discovered
a
ford
in
cane
creek
and
having
crossed
with
a
portion
of
his
command
attacked
the
whigs
in
the
rear
this
soon
ended
the
battle
which
was
a
bloody
one
to
both
sides
about
the
same
time
with
the
capture
of
hillsboro
a
most
gallant
and
successful
attack
was
made
upon
the
tory
stronghold
at
elizabethtown
in
bladen
county
there
sixty
whigs
in

of

was
treated
from
the
hour
of
his
capture
with
extraordinary
harshness
he
was
compelled
to
march
all
the
way
to

and
after
some
delay
was
sent
thence
by

placed
the
captive

upon

island
near

deadly
malaria
was
supplemented
by
danger
of
assassination
from
certain

who
were
loud
in
their
threats
of
executing
such

purpose
burke
made
repeated
applications
for
a
change
of
quarters
or
for

as

was
told
that

was
kept
as

feeling
that
he
was
justified
in
disregarding

effected
his
escape
and
returned
to

resumed
his
office
for
the
short
interval
between

meeting
of

to
his
great
discomfiture
he
was
defeated
at

by

mafitin
the
members
of

could
not
forgive
this
breach
of

and
he
regarded
their
act
as
evidence
of
public
condemnation
his
sensitive
spirit
brooded
over
this
his
domestic
relations
were
not
such
as

the
of

as
has
been
previously
stated
lord
cornwallis
surrendered
himself
and
his
army
to
general
washington
at
yorktown
in
virginia
the
timely
arrival
of
the
friendly
french
fleet
under
count
rochambeau
enabled
washington
to
lay
siege
to
cornwallis
and
force
him
to
surrender
the
english
commander
who
was
a
skillful
soldier
complained
that
he
had
been
forced
by
the
orders
of
his
superior
officer
and
against
his
own
judgment
into
a
position
from
which
he
could
not
escape
general
la
fayette
however
doubtless
had
at
least
an
equal
share
in
bringing
about
the
result
for
it
was
his
skillful
maneuvering
of
an
inferior
force
that
held
cornwallis
checked
so
that
washington
was
enabled
to
bring
his
troops
to
their
appointed
places
at
the
appointed
times
and
cut
off
all
hope
of
escape
but
a
glorious
day
it
was
for
the
colonies
for
it
virtually
put
an
end
to
the
war
and
everybody
knew
it
the
only
real
questions
henceforth
were
as
to
the
terms
of
the
peace
independence
and
peace
were
now
assured
when
the
news
reached
england
of
cornwallis
surrender
lord
north
the
british
prime
minister
exclaimed
oh
god
it
is
all
over
he
well
knew
that
the
stubborn
king
had
exhausted
the
patience
of
the
english
people
they
and
not
the
king
and
his
ministers
at
last
put
a
stop
to
the
bloodshed
between
the
two
countries
on
november
a
treaty
was
signed
in
paris
by
which
american
independence
was
acknowledged
the
war
was
over
at
last
the
seven
years
of
deadly
conflict
were
ended
thanks
to
their
patient
endurance
their
undaunted
courage
and
their
untiring
perseverance
the
american
colonies
had
at
last
achieved
their
independence
north
carolina
was
at
last
a
free
and
independent
state
owing
neither
allegiance
or
fealty
to
any
prince
or
power
in
the
world
of
coarse
there
was
great
joy
at
the
coming
of
peace
with
the
full
recognition
of
the
colonies
as
independent
states
but
there
were
still
more
difficulties
to
be
overcome
before
the
full
tide
of
peace
and
prosperity
could
set
in
the
agricultural
interest
of
the
state
was
doubtless
affected
by
the
war
less
than
any
other
owing
to
the
employment
of
slave
labor
but
the
soldiers
had
returned
and
wanted
homes
homes
were
not
to
be
provided
in
a
day
nor
the
implements
of
husbandry
rude
though
they
were
at
that
time
cattle
and
horses
too
were
to
be
obtained
before
the
soldier
became
a
farmer
the
finances
of
the
country
were
in
a
wretched
condition
there
was
no
money
to
pay
the
current
expenses
of
the
government
and
none
even
to
pay
the
troops
in
educational
matters
the
condition
was
no
better
there
were
only
two
chartered
schools
in
the
state
one
at
new
bern
and
one
at
charlotte
the
constitution
had
indeed
enjoined
the
establishment
of
schools
and
colleges
but
with
north
carolinians
of
that
day
it
was
freedom
first
and
education
afterwards
the
population
however
had
increased
steadily
during
the
war
so
that
in
spite
of
its
casualties
the
state
was
stronger
in
numbers
in
than
in
the
legislature
met
at
its
appointed
times
and
places
and
so
did
the
courts
and
civil
law
had
resumed
its
sway
but
swords
are
not
turned
into
hooks
in
a
moment
nor
are
the
feuds
of
a
long
bitter
war
to
be
settled
or
forgotten
in
an
hour
naturally
the
whigs
bitterly
remembered
how
much
they
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
tories
during
the
long
deadly
struggle
many
of
these
latter
had
fled
from
the
province
but
now
desired
to
return
and
be
restored
to
citizenship
or
at
least
to
receive
possession
of
their
former
homes
but
the
people
resolved
that
this
should
not
be
so
for
they
wanted
no
tories
among
them
accordingly
when
tories
who
had
left
their
homes
desired
to
return
to
them
after
the
peace
permission
was
refused
them
but
it
was
necessary
to
reward
the
whigs
as
well
as
to
punish
the
tories
a
broad
fertile
land
watered
by
great
navigable
rivers
and
abounding
in
every
possible
resource
for
pleasure
wealth
and
prosperity
was
secured
to
us
by
their
courage
and
endurance
but
if
our
brave
soldiers
desired
reward
how
much
more
did
they
deserve
their
pay
which
was
still
largely
in
arrears
commissioners
therefore
were
appointed
to
sell
the
lands
of
refugee
tories
and
from
that
and
other
sources
to
pay
up
the
arrears
due
the
north

furthermore
the
land
now
known
as
tennessee
then
a

the
state
of
franklin
during
the
years
that
followed
upon
the
close
of
the
revolution
the
people
of
north
carolina
were
busied
with
the
restoration
of
their
ravaged
fields
and
the
development
of
the
new
system
of
inaugurated
by
the
convention
of
halifax
in
there
were
many
good
and
wise
men
in
america
who
had
no
confidence
in
the
perpetuity
or
effectiveness
of
a
polity
which
rested
upon
the
wisdom
and
virtue
of
the
masses
for
its
enforcement
samuel
johnston
and
the
leading
lawyers
of
that
day
were
full
of
apprehension
as
to
the
result
where
the
protection
of
life
liberty
and
property
rested
upon
the
ballots
of
men
who
were
as
a
general
thing
poor
and
unlettered
the
halifax
constitution
sought
to
provide
for
the
education
of
the
people
and
had
recommended
the
establishment
of
a
university
but
no
steps
had
been
taken
by
the
legislature
to
carry
out
this
wise
and
beneficent
ordinance
the
rev
drs
david
caldwell
and
samuel
mccorkle
were
conducting
schools
on
their
own
responsibility
in
guilford
and
mecklenburg
in
which
many
young
men
were
receiving
sound
and
useful
preparation
for
life
and
there
were
similar
academies
in
wilmington
new
bern
edenton
and
charlotte
but
as
a
general
thing
education
was
almost
entirely
neglected
under
the
terms
of
the
articles
of
confederation
the
general
congress
continued
to
assemble
but
its
sessions
resulted
in
little
good
to
america
the
government
was
continually
embarrassed
by
the
public
debt
contracted
in
the
revolution
it
could
only
pay
such
liabilities
by
calling
upon
the
several
states
for
their
proportions
these
were
regulated
by
the
value
of
the
real
estate
north
carolina
thus
witnessing
the
helplessness
of
the
general
government
to
meet
its
pecuniary
liabilities
was
moved
to
the
noble
resolution
of
ceding
the
great
body
of
land
then
belonging
to
the
state
west
of
the
allegheny
mountains
this
princely
domain
now
constituting
the
great
state
of
tennessee
was
at
that
period
only
settled
in
part
by
white
people
and
many
millions
of
acres
of
fertile
lands
could
be
sold
to
settlers
such
a
resource
would
have
brought
a
great
fund
to
the
state
for
education
and
other
useful
purposes
but
with
unexampled
devotion
to
the
general
good
it
was
determined
by
the
legislature
of
that
the
governor
should
tender
to
the
federal
government
as
a
free
gift
all
the
lands
not
already
granted
to
soldiers
and
actual
settlers
to
an
embarrassed
government
unable
to
meet
its
most
solemn
engagements
such
a
boon
it
seems
would
have
been
gladly
received
but
so
great
was
the
selfishness
of
certain
states
which
were
then
struggling
to
secure
for
themselves
such
bodies
of
western
lands
that
the
intended
bounty
of
north
carolina
proved
a
failure
the
general
congress
having
failed
to
accept
the
offer
the
act
authorizing
the
cession
was
repealed
the
story
of
this
patriotic
munificence
on
the
part
of
north
carolina
ends
not
here
when
it
became
known
among
the
western
settlers
that
their
country
had
thus
been
offered
to
the
general
government
much
excitement
followed
colonel
john
sevier
of
king
mountain
fame
was
a
leader
among
the
people
of
the
territory
in
question
he
had
been
a
gallant
soldier
in
the
revolution
and
was
trusted
and
beloved
by
his
neighbors
he
persuaded
them
that
north
carolina
in
thus
offering
to
surrender
her
claims
to
their
allegiance
had
forfeited
all
right
to
further
control
their
destinies
he
procured
the
support
of
many
others
who
elected
members
to
a
convention
this
body
met
at
greenville
in
november
and
framed
a
government
of
a
state
which
they
called
franklin
in
honor
of
the
illustrious
statesman
benjamin
franklin
colonel
sevier
was
elected
governor
and
judges
and
other
officers
were
also
chosen
richard
caswell
had
again
been
made
governor
of
north
carolina
when
it
became
known
that
such
things
were
being
done
in
the
west
he
issued
a
proclamation
forbidding
the
whole
movement
and
denouncing
it
as
revolutionary
and
unlawful
he
was
supported
by
a
party
there
headed
by
colonel
john
tipton
it
often
seemed
that
bloody
civil
war
would
ensue
between
the
men
who
sided
respectively
with
sevier
and
tipton
but
happily
there
was
little
bloodshed
amid
so
much
brawling
there
were
many
arrests
and
complaints
until
finally
in
october
colonel
sevier
was
captured
by
the
forces
of
tipton
and
brought
to
jail
at
morganton
in
burke
county
he
was
allowed
to
escape
and
in
memory
of
his
services
as
a
soldier
his
offences
were
forgiven
that
there
were
no
more
serious
results
was
greatly
due
to
the
influence
of
richard
caswell
sevier
was
afterwards
in
the
senate
of
north
carolina
and
after
tennessee
became
a
state
received
all
the
honors
a
grateful
people
could
confer
note
there
was
no
money
in
circulation
in
the
state
of
franklin
and
the
following
curious
statement
taken
from
the
old
records
shows
how
payment
was
to
be
made
to
the
public
officers
be
it
enacted
by
the
general
assembly
of
the
state
of
franklin
and
it
is
hereby
enacted
by
the
authority
of
the

that
the
salaries

the
confederation
of
states
each
day
was
demonstrating
more
clearly
the
failure
of
the
confederation
its
poverty
and
weakness
were
exciting
the
contempt
of
all
civilized
nations
and
the
general
congress
amounted
to
little
more
than
an
arena
for
the
display
of
jealousy
and
selfishness
on
the
part
of
the
individual
states
in
north
carolina
as
elsewhere
the
people
were
divided
as
to
what
should
be
done
to
remedy
this
great
need
of
a
central
and
general
government
many
were
opposed
to
any
change
others
were
for
creating
a
strong
and
overpowering
central
government
that
should
overawe
and
control
all
of
the
states
these
latter
men
were
called
the
federalists
another
and
a
larger
portion
of
the
people
of
the
state
were
in
favor
of
adding
to
the
powers
of
the
general
government
but
at
the
same
time
for
going
no
further
in
that
direction
than
was
necessary
for
the
general
safety
as
against
foreign
nations
and
for
the
execution
of
such
regulations
as
pertained
to
all
the
states
these
republicans
or
democrats
were
willing
to
empower
the
new
government
to
carry
the
mails
control
commerce
carry
on
war
make
treaties
and
coin
money
but
they
insisted
that
all
other
powers
should
be
retained
by
the
states
themselves
in
in
consequence
of
the
action
of
the
general
congress
a
convention
of
all
the
states
was
ordered
to
meet
in
philadelphia
to
prepare
a
new
constitution
the
legislature
of
north
carolina
selected
governor
richard
caswell
colonel
davie
alexander
martin
willie
jones
and
richard
dobbs
spaight
as
delegates
to
that
body
governor
caswell
and
willie
jones
declined
the
honor
and
hugh
williamson
and
william
mount
were
appointed
in
their
places
general
washington
was
chosen
as
president
of
the
convention
and
in
the
result
of
their
deliberations
was
submitted
for
the
ratification
of
the
several
states
it
was
provided
by
the
convention
framing
the
constitution
that
nine
states
should
ratify
the
new
constitution
before
it
should
go
into
operation
and
that
it
should
then
be
binding
only
upon
those
thus
acceding
to
it
a
convention
for
north
carolina
was
called
and
met
at
hillsboro
july
to
consider
the
proposed
constitution
samuel
johnston
who
had
been
moderator
of
several
provincial
congresses
and
who
had
also
succeeded
governor
caswell
as
of
the
state
was
chosen
to
preside
he
and
judge
james
iredell
colonel
davie
and
archibald
maclaine
were
earnest
advocates
of
instant
and
unconditional
ratification
on
the
part
of
north
carolina
willie
jones
of
halifax
who
had
so
long
controlled
much
of
the
legislation
and
government
of
the
state
was
the
leader
of
those
who
opposed
such
action
they
favored
the
addition
of
numerous
amendments
before
committing
the
fortunes
of
north
carolina
to
such
control
they
insisted
that
without
further
specification
the
powers
reserved
to
the
several
states
would
not
be
sufficiently
guarded
and
the
convention
by
a
great
majority
took
the
same
view
of
the
matter
the
result
was
that
while
declining
to
ratify
absolutely
the
constitution
as
it
then
stood
the
hope
was
held
out
that
upon
the
adoption
of
proper
amendments
it
would
be
ratified
there
was
great
excitement
in
the
state
upon
north
thus
failing
to
join
the
new
government
political
animosities
ran
high
and
renewed
efforts
were
made
to
overcome
the
popular
objections
the
people
became
restless
at
the
position
they
were
occupying
being
thus
with
new
york
and
rhode
island
strangers
to
the
great
compact
of
their
sister
states
the
new
government
of
the
united
states
went
into
operation
in
the
spring
of
and
general
washington
took
the
oaths
of
office
on
march
as
the
first
president
of
the
republic
in
november
the
legislature
and
a
new
convention
both
met
at
fayetteville
and
on
the
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
speedily
ratified
and
north
carolina
was
enrolled
as
a
member
of
the
new
confederacy
which
was
to
astonish
all
nations
by
the
vigor
of
its
rule
and
the
splendor
and
rapidity
of
its
growth
as
a
nation
before
this
however
the
first
ten
amendments
to
the
constitution
had
been
proposed
to
the
legislatures
of
the
several
states
for
ratification
thereby
allaying
the
apprehensions
that
had
been
felt
at
hillsboro
the
year
before
two
important
matters
were
also
settled
at
this
period
the
convention
at
hillsboro
limited
the
seat
of
the
state
government
to
some
point
in
wake
county
the
capital
had
been
migrating
from
town
to
town
for
nearly
the
whole
period
of
north
existence
the
legislature
also
passed
a
bill
creating
the
university
of
north
carolina
and
the
terms
of
the
halifax
constitution
as
to
popular
education
were
thus
first
put
into
some
shape
of
accomplishment
both
of
these
measures
were
highly
needed
note
the
state
convention
of
was
commissioned
to
select
a
place
for
the
seat
of
government
which
had
been
migratory
since
the
earliest
days
of
the
carolina
colony
the
place
selected
for
the
capital
was
the
farm
of
isaac
hunter
at
wake
court
house
or
some
other
place
within
ten
miles
of
that
locality
to
be
determined
by
the
general
assembly
questions
what
question
was
exciting
the
people
of
north

at
this
period
what
was
thought
of
the

how
were
the
people
of
the

great
question

some
of
the
prominent
members
view
the
question
what
different
opinion
was
held
by
other
leading
men
what
did
the
convention
do
with
the
constitution
what
was
the
effect
on
the

what
other
states
also
failed
to
ratify

go
into
operation

was

first
president
of
the

when
and
where
did
north

ratify
the
constitution
and
become
a
member
of
the
united

what
two
important
matters
were
settled
at
this
period
chapter
xxxix
france
and
america
to
when
north
carolina
had
thus
taken
her
place
in
the
federal
union
and
the
whole
system
of
state
and
national
polity
became
perfected
in
america
many
hearts
beat
with
gratitude
to
god
for
the
promises
of
a
glorious
future
the
magnificent
realm
won
by
the
blood
of
heroes
was
at
last
guarded
by
a
system
of
laws
so
wise
and
effective
that
peace
and
prosperity
were
soon
to
make
it
one
of
the
greatest
of
civilized
lands
this
example
of
freedom
achieved
in
the
wilds
of
america
was
speedily
felt
in
europe
general
washington
had
been
in
the
discharge
of
his
duties
as
president
about
a
month
when
the
of
france
met
in
the
famous
convention
which
was
to
pull
down
the
ancient
french
monarchy
and
engulf
all
europe
in
seas
of
blood
the
overtaxed
and
excitable
frenchmen
were
maddened
by
the
contrast
afforded
in
their
sufferings
and
the
blessings
achieved
by
their
late
allies
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic

caswell
while
in
the
discharge
of
his

was
shortly
followed
in
death
by
william
hooper
and
archibald
maclaine
willie
jones
had
retired
from
public
life
and
thus
four
most
conspicuous
leaders
almost
simultaneously
disappeared
from
public
life
colonel
william
davie
of
halifax
john
haywood
of
the
same
county
and
alfred
moore
of
brunswick
were
greatly
influential
and
were
worthy
successors
of
the
older
servants
of
the
public
who
had
been
thus
removed
from
the
arena
of
their
former
usefulness
governor
johnston
having
been
elected
united

senator
was
succeeded
as
governor
by
alexander

raleigh
was
selected
for

a
large
tract
of
land
at

court
house
had
been
bought
of
colonel
joel
lane
and
upon
it
a
city
was
laid
off
and
the
public
buildings
erected
before
that
time
since
governor
tryon
palace
at
new
bern
had
been
burned
the
main
question
to
be
determined
by
every
general
assembly
was
what
town
should
be
selected
for
the
holding
of
the
next
session
fayetteville
hillsboro
new
bern
and
tarboro
were
sure
to
get
up
an
excitement
and
contest
as
to
which
of
them
should
be
next
favored
with
the
presence
of
the
state
officers
and
the
general
assembly
the
governor
and
his
assistants
had
been
dwelling
wherever
it
best
suited
them
and
the
public
records
had
thus
been
continually
migrating
over
the
state
there
was
little
church
organization
in
america
until
after
the
revolution
there
was
not
a
single
bishop
of
the
episcopal
church
in
all
america
before
the
revolution
and
not
until
was
an
effort
made
to
supply
such
a
prelate
for
the
church
in
north

the
rev
charles
pettigrew
was
then
elected
bishop
of
the
diocese
by
a
convention
at
tarboro
but
he
died
before
consecration
the
baptists
had
united
their
churches
in
this
state
and
southern
virginia
in
in
a
body
which
was
called
the
kehukee
association
in
the
presbyterians
had
formed
the
presbytery
of
orange
and
in
they
set
off
the
synode
of
the
carolinas
the
quakers
and
moravians
were
flourishing
in
certain
sections
but
as
yet
the
methodist
missionaries
had
effected
but
little
in
the
way
of
planting
churches
in
north
carolina
richard
dobbs
spaight
in
became
governor
and
was
the
first
native
north
carolinian
to
fill
that
distinguished
office
he
possessed
much
ability
and
was
familiar
with
the
conduct
of
public
affairs
he
found
that
great
excitement
and
division
existed
among
the
people
as
to
the
french
revolution
because
aid
had
been
sent
from
that
country
to
the
struggling
american
colonists
many
men
insisted
that
it
was
the
duty
of
america
to
take
sides
with
france
in
the
war
then
raging
in
europe
general
washington
and
other
wise
men
resisted
this
dangerous
opinion
and
held
that
america
should
take
no
part
in
the
affairs
of
foreign
nations
the
great
struggle
went
on
with
napoleon
bonaparte
rapidly
growing
more
formidable
to
the
allied
kings
the
french
had
acquired
a
thirst
for
freedom
from
america
but
they
in
turn
exerted
an
influence
upon
the
religious
creeds
of
our
people
french
books
and
modes
of
thought
and
french
fashions
became
popular
and
the
country
debating
clubs
were
heard
repeating
the
doubts
and
sneers
of
voltaire
diderot
and
other
french
infidels
the
world
creeds
were
on
trial
kings
and
priests
were
as
keenly
criticised
as
in
the
sixteenth
century
but
out
of
all
the
turmoil
and
bloodshed
a
larger
measure
of
liberty
was
to
be
won
constitutional
kings
and
purified
churches
were
the
outgrowth
and
result
of
the
most
prodigious
uproar
yet
witnessed
among
civilized

federalists
and
the
republicans
to
in
the
last
days
of
the
eighteenth
century
men
became
more
and
more
plainly
divided
into
two
political
parties
thomas
jefferson
of
virginia
a
man
of
decided
genius
and
consummate
ability
was
the
leader
of
those
who
maintained
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
should
be
strictly
limited
to
the
powers
expressly
granted
in
the
federal
constitution
and
prohibited
from
the
use
of
any
of
those
reserved
to
the
individual
states
alexander
hamilton
of
new
york
another
very
able
and
patriotic
statesman
took
an
entirely
different
view
he
did
not
consider
the
people
capable
of
ruling
the
country
and
wished
to
subordinate
the
state
governments
to
federal
authority
the
federalists
were
those
who
followed
his
views
while
the
republicans
were
no
less
strenuous
in
upholding
jefferson
and
his
policy
the
superior
courts
of
this

came
to
his
death
in
a
singular
manner
he
was
in
extreme
old
age
and
had
suffered
with
a
long
and
wasting
illness
one
warm
evening
he
was
carried
out
and
laid
upon
the
grass
beneath
a
tree
in
his
yard
while
lying
there
the
red
flannel
of
his
shirt
infuriated
a
large
which
attacked
him
with
great
violence
when
judge
spencer
feeble
cries
attracted
attention
he
had
been
so
injured
that
he
soon
after
died
of
nervous
exhaustion
in
accordance
with
the
law

was
one
of

most
violent
of

a

grew
into
such
disfavor
that
few

could

this
it
may
be
safely
asserted

to

he
had
been
appointed
to

contingent
when
it
seemed
that
war
with
france
was
inevitable
but
that
danger
had
happily
passed

nathaniel
macon
of

soon
became
conspicuous
for
his
virtue
and
weight
of
character
perhaps
no
other
member
of
congress
ever
wielded
so
lasting
and
powerful
an
influence
his
unquestioned
sagacity
integrity
and
inflexible
adhesion
to
what
he
believed
to
be
right
and
his
unselfish
devotion
to
the
public
good
made
his
opposition
to
any
measure
almost
necessarily
fatal
to
its
passage
in
the
house
to
which
he
belonged
there
was
grief
in
the
last
hours
of
the
century
when
it
became
known
that
general
washington
had
died
in
his
retirement
at
mt
vernon
judge
james
iredell
had
also
died
about
the

time
he
had
been
one
of
the
associate
justices
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
by
the
appointment
of
general
washington
and
fell
a
victim
to
the
enormous
labors
incurred
in
riding
the
great
distances
involved
in
attending
his
different
circuit
courts
this
was
perhaps
the
golden
age
of
social
enjoyments
in
north
carolina
the
quakers
were
abolitionists
as
were
also
many
other
good
people
but
the
question
had
not
been
agitated
and
there
was
nothing
to
give
uneasiness
to
masters
or
false
hopes
to
the
slaves
these
latter
shared
largely
in
the
festivities
of
the
white
people
and
were
free
for
many
years
to
come
to
conduct
their
religious
services
in
any
way
that
seemed
best
to
their
wild
and
fantastic
notions
the
president
had
appointed
alfred
moore
as
the
successor
of

on

bench
he
was
also
a

effected
in

by

statute
of
four
ridings
were
established
the

after

these

were
required
to

to

the
sheriffs
were
no

obliged
to

with
drawn

before

among

last
official
acts
was
the
pardoning
of
john
stanly
for
killing
spaight
in
a
duel
this
had
occurred
on
sunday
september
and
was
the
outgrowth
of
a
bitter
political
controversy
spaight
was
a
republican
and
had
warmly
opposed
the
election
of
the
able
and
impulsive
young
leader
of
the
federalists
in
the
same
year
occurred
the
exodus
of
the
remnant
of
the
tuscaroras
from
bertie
county
the
reservation
on
roanoke
river
which
had
been
granted
them
for
good
conduct
in
the
indian
war
of
was
sold
by
them
to
private
parties
and
they
emigrated
to
new
york
where
the
other
parts
of
the
tribe
had
long
been
located
among
the
laws
of
the
legislature
of
was

statute
providing
for
the
payment
to
the
patentees
of
the
of
a
given
sum
for
every
saw
used
in
each
machine
this
implement
had
been
recently
invented
by
eli
whitney
who
was
a
young
man
from
new
england
engaged
in
teaching
school
in
georgia
before
this
time
only
small
patches
of
cotton
had
been
seen
in
the
southern
states
the
lint
was
picked
from
the
seed
only
by
hand
and
so
slow
was
the
process
that
a
shoe
full
of
the
seed
cotton
was
a
task
usually
given
to
be
done
between
supper
and
bedtime
whitney
invention
was
soon
to
affect
the
agriculture
and
commerce
of
the
world
the
cotton
gin
has
greatly
aided
the
development
of
all
civilized
nations
it
has
built
cities
freighted
mighty
fleets
and
given
employment
to
many
millions
of
the
human
race
attention
has
already
been
called
to
the
effects
of
french
atheism
upon
the
united
states
the
tide
of
unbelief
rolled
on
until
many
religious
people
trembled
for
the
creed
and
morals
of
american
people
its
terrible
influence
was
seen
and
felt
in
almost
every
department
and
employment
of
life
in
a
mighty
religious
movement
began
in
kentucky
and
spread
over
a
large
portion
of
the
republic
vast
assemblages
of
the
people
were
seen
at
the
camp
meetings
for
weeks
together
the
ordinary
avocations
of
life
were
abandoned
by
multitudes
in
order
to
engage
in
religious
worship
and
in
the
end
the
churches
were
reinforced
by
many
thousands
of
new
members
questions

prominent

at

a

to
the
republic
of
america
was
wisely
ruled
during
the
eight
years
of
jefferson
administration
as
president
he
was
not
only
the
greatest
of
political
philosophers
but
a
consummate
party
leader
under
his
management
the
federalists
were
so
completely
won
over
that
even
john
adams
was
found
among
the
electors
who
voted
for
jefferson
vermont
ohio
kentucky
and
tennessee
were
added
to
the
list
of
states
and
the
vast
territory
known
as
louisiana
was
purchased
from
france
and
made
a
portion
of
the
american
union
for
this
magnificent
territory
the
united
states
paid
fifteen
million
dollars
but
with
all
this
evidence
of
internal
advancement
there
was
unnecessary
and
trouble
with
foreign
powers
great
britain
had
not
only
failed
to
carry
out
the
conditions
of
the
treaty
of
paris
but
continual
trouble
and
war
with
the
western
indians
were
traced
to
the
plotting
of
british
agents
in
europe
on
the
high
seas
american
ships
were
frequently
subjected
to
wrong
and
indignity
by
british
cruisers
which
seized
their
cargoes
or
crews
on
various
pretexts
these
maddening
interferences
were
fast
bringing
the
people
of
the
united
states
to
a
determination
to
vindicate
by
arms
their
claims
as
a
free
and
independent
people
europe
was
still
convulsed
by
war
napoleon
bonaparte
had
been
crowned
emperor
and
in
the
mighty
struggle
the
claims
of
the
aggrieved
public
were
overlooked
or
despised
the
people
of
north
carolina
were
still
in
great
want
of
general
education
the
university
at
chapel
hill
was
sending
out
graduates
who
had
already
conferred
honor
upon
that
seat
of
learning
but
the
preparatory
schools
so
necessary
as
feeders
to
such
an
establishment
were
few
and
far
between
rev
william
bingham
had
begun
a
school
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
state
he
removed
temporarily
to
pittsboro
but
finally
settled
at
hillsboro
and
established
the
academy
which
is
even
at
this
day
continued
near
by
at
mebaneville
under
the
management
of
one
of
his
descendants
this
school
dating
from
was
even
in
its
infancy
of
marked
excellence
and
has
won
more
reputation
than
any
similar
institution
in
the
southern
states
rev
david
caldwell
school
in
guilford
rev
freeman
in
murfreesboro
and
a
few
academies
in
the
villages
however
meritorious
produced
but
slight
effect
upon
the
great
mass
of
the
people
there
had
not
been
opened
a
single
free
school
in
all
the
state
occasionally
there
could
be
found
neighborhoods
where
a
few
citizens
joined
in
employing
a
man
to
teach
the
elementary
branches
of
english
education
but
these
were
generally
attended
for
only
a
few
months
and
were
not
very
admirable
either
for
discipline
or
in
the
matters
taught
the
people
of
the
interior
and
west
were
becoming
anxious
for
some
means
of
conveyance
and
travel
to
the
outer
world
the
crops
raised
were
generally
too
bulky
to
pay
for
expensive
transportation
over
long
distances
and
for
this
reason
were
available
to
feed
only
the
community
in
which
they
were
grown
tobacco
from
all
the
counties
in
the
northern
portion
of
the
state
was
conveyed
to
market
by
rolling
the
hogsheads
containing
it
along
the
roads
to
markets
at
petersburg
in
virginia
and
fayetteville
in
the
regions
of
the
pine
much
attention
was
given
to
the
preparation
of
turpentine
and
tar
indeed
so
large
a
trade
grew
up
in
these
articles
that
some
people
abroad
came
to
think
that
north
carolina
produced
little
else
there
were
no
turpentine
distilleries
to
be
found
at
this
time
in
north
carolina
and
the
crude
product
of
the
tree
was
shipped
from
our
ports
to
be
manufactured
in
other
states
in
during
the
sessions
of
the
legislature
general
james
wellborn
of
wilkes
introduced
a
proposition
to
build
at
the
state
expense
a
turnpike
from
beaufort
harbor
to
the
mountains
but
this
and
all
other
such
improvements
were
neglected
for
some
time
to
come
the
canal
through
the
dismal
swamp
was
to
prove
very
beneficial
to
eastern
counties
but
this
work
though
authorized
long
before
was
yet
unfinished
vessels
to
new
york
or
baltimore
still
passed
out
to
sea
by
the
dangers
of
cape
hatteras
and
not
unfrequently
both
cargo
and
crew
were
engulfed
amid
its
cruel
sands
there
was
at
this
period
of
our
history
a
brisk
trade
between
the
west
indies
and
several
of
the
eastern
towns
wilmington
new
bern
washington
and
edenton
were
all
largely
engaged
in
the
shipment
of
staves
and
provisions
importing
salt
and
tropical
stores
in
return
this
and
all
other
foreign
trade
was
ruthlessly
stopped
by
the
embargo
laid
by
congress
this
embargo
was
the
result
of
an
act
of
congress
which
forbade
the
exportation
of
all
goods
from
the
united
states
to
great
britain
or
her
dependencies
it
was
very
similar
to
the
expedient
resorted
to
by
the
second
continental
congress
for
a
like
purpose
but
was
not
enforced
by
any
voluntary
associations
of
the
people
as
it
was
in
this
extreme
measure
failed
to
bring
great
britain
to
a
surrender
of
her
claim
to
search
american
ships
and
on
the
of
june
for
this
and
other
just
causes
war
was
declared
against
her
madison
would
have
temporized
and
still
deferred
the
dreadful
expedient
but
the
american
people
were
resolved
upon
indemnity
for
the
past
and
security
for
the
future
and
thus
two
kindred
nations
were
to
waste
blood
and
treasure
in
an
unnecessary
quarrel

once
more
to

the
full
benefits
of
trade

commerce
british

had
made
all
foreign
commodities
very
scarce
and
costly
salt
had
been
made
on
the

in
limited
quantities
but
of

it
was
therefore
gratifying
to
the

to
see
the

again
filled
with
goods
of
every
description
when
this
period
of

had

a

the

prospered

though
no

yet
much

were
seen
in

fayetteville
twice
as
many
wilmington

were
the
largest
and
most
important
towns
in

but
were
still
limited
in
population

edenton

had

lost

in

joseph

had
been
for
many
years
president
of
the
university
he
came
from
new
jersey
to
make
north

his
future
home
and
gave
the
state
of
his
adoption
so
laborious
and
useful
a
devotion
that
his
name
will
be
cherished
in
its
limits
so
long
as
learning
and
patriotism
are
valued
he
was
not
only
making
the
college
famous
for
the
excellence
of
its
appointments
but
internal
improvement
was
advocated
by
him
so
intelligently
and
zealously
that
the
general
apathy
on
the
two
great
subjects
of
education
and
intercommunication
was
passing
away
the
churches
were
likewise
providing
for
increased
effect
among
the
people
the
methodist
conference
was
each
year
adding
to
the
number
of
its
churches

able
address
before

on

subject

a
considerable
interest
was
awakened
the

in
the

was
built
in

in
massachusetts
and
was
only
two

long
it

the

was
the

at

with
leonard
henderson
and
john

as
associates
constituted
a
tribunal
which
was
soon
to
win
the
veneration
of
american
lawyers
this
has
been
called
the
era
of
good
feeling
in
american
politics
but
the
question
of
slavery
in
the
territories
was
fast
assuming
a
dangerous
importance
the
northern
states
objected
to
the
admission
of
any
more
slave
states
the
southern
would
consent
to
no
such
prohibition
the
storm
grew
louder
until
it
was
temporarily
settled
by

missouri
compromise
of

provided
that

slavery
should
be
forever
forbidden

chapter
xlv
the
whigs
and
the
democrats
to
in
the
decade
following
the
enactment
of
the
missouri
compromise
there
was
prodigious
material
growth
in
every
section
of
the
american
union
in
north
carolina
the
real
prosperity
of
the
people
was
imperceptible
by
reason
of
the
heavy
emigration
to
the
south
and
west
not
only
population
but
wealth
was
continually
withdrawing
to
more
profitable
fields
of
labor
and
speculation
while
the
northern
and
western
sections
of
the
union
were
receiving
the
thousands
who
came
every
year
from
europe
and
elsewhere
there
was
no
such
accession
to
our
numbers
for
a
century
past
there
has
been
little
or
no
immigration
to
north
carolina
the
stream
of
settlers
that
once
poured
so
steadily
into
the
hill
country
had
ceased
even
before
the
revolution
after
the
overthrow
of
the
federalists
by
jefferson
in
the
year
there
was
no
national
party
struggle
on
the
old
issues
but
in
every
portion
of
the
country
were
individuals
who
adhered
to
the
views
of
alexander
hamilton
as
to
the
proper
construction
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
many
of
these
were
men
of
great
social
and
professional
eminence
under
madison
and
his
successors
there
was
in
fact
no
party
but
the
every
one
who
hoped
for
political
promotion
professed
the
faith
of
that
organization
there
was
no
party
division
as
to
the
bank
or
the
united
states
or
the
tariff
of
duties
on
foreign
imports
in
the
year
the
state
was
graced
by
the
visit
of
general
la
fayette
a
half
century
before
he
had
left
his
wife
and
all
the
charms
of
life
in
paris
to
do
battle
in
behalf
of
the
struggling
american
colonies
after
acting
a
distinguished
part
in
the
french
revolution
he
had
returned
as
the
nation
guest
to
receive
the
thanks
of
another
generation
for
the
great
services
he
had
rendered
in
the
past
he
went
from
state
to
state
every
where
greeted
with
the
utmost
love
and
veneration
he
soon
returned
to
france
in
the
united
states
ship
brandywine
after
receiving
princely
recognition
and
rewards
from
congress
in
this
year
also
a
considerable
excitement
was
created
on
account
of
an
extraordinary
advance
in
the
price
of
cotton
in
a
few
weeks
the
price
went
from
twelve
to
cents
per
pound
this
great
rise
was
only
temporary
and
many
people
were
ruined
by
the
sudden
and
unexpected
fall
in
the
election
of
john
quincy
adams
by
the
house
of
representatives
to
the
presidency
resulted
in
giving
a
new
aspect
to
political
matters
general
andrew
jackson
who
had
received
the
largest
popular
vote
and
was
then
a
senator
from
tennessee
became
the
leader
of
those
who
were
called
democrats
those
who
were
opposed
to
him
assumed
the
name
of
whigs
adams
though
elected
as
a
soon
found
that
party
arrayed
against
his
administration
henry
clay
and
all
of
those
who
had
been
federalists
supported
the
president
in
north
carolina
many
prominent
men
arrayed
themselves
with
the
new
party
these
whigs
as
they
were
called
advocated
a
continuance
of
the
united
states
bank
a
tariff
for
protection
on
importations
and
a
distribution
to
the
several
states
of
the
money
realized
by
the
sale
of
public
lands
general
jackson
and
the
democrats
favored
a
tariff
for
revenue
they
contended
that
the
national
bank
was
not
only
unauthorized
by
the
constitution
but
also
dangerous
to
the
liberties
of
the
people
they
were
likewise
unfriendly
to
the
plan
of
making
the
states
pensioners
of
the
general
government
as
proposed
in
the
policy
of
distribution
soon
great
rancor
developed
between
the
two
parties
both
of
which
had
lately
been
included
in
the
republican
ranks
henry
clay
and
john
randolph
inaugurated
animosities
by
a
duel
and
soon
in
north
carolina
as
elsewhere
social
amenities
were
but
little
regarded
between
the
whigs
and
democrats
this
was
very
absurd
all
were
citizens
of
a
free
country
and
were
entitled
to
hold
and
express
opinions
as
to
what
was
the
best
policy
for
the
government
to
pursue
god
has
so
constituted
men
that
of
necessity
they
must
differ
in
opinion
on
all
subjects
how
weak
and
wicked
then
is
the
man
who
hates
his
brother
because
of
the
failure
to
agree
on
matters
that
are
after
all
involved
in
doubt
it
was
not
always
so
however
for
when
the
constitution
was
framed
in
philadelphia
in
all
the
states
but
massachusetts
recognized
the
legality
of
slave
property
very
soon
afterwards
however
the
society
for
african
emancipation
was
formed
with
benjamin
franklin
as
its
president
this
body
petitioned
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
states
and
territories
but
was
answered
that
the
constitution
left
this
matter
to
the
states
and
that
the
federal
authorities
had
no
powers
the
northern
states
finding
slave
labor
unprofitable
had
all
abolished
this
institution
in
their
midst
and
their
slaves
had
been
sent
to
the
south
and
sold
southern
men
also
had
been
divided
as
to
the
policy
of
continuing
a
state
of
society
so
opposed
to
the
general
liberties
of
mankind
but
this
liberal
spirit
in
the
south
was
checked
by
the
violent
and
unreasonable
criticisms
and
denunciations
of
the
northern
reformers
questions
what
growth
was
noticed
in
the

during
the
years

the
condition
of
the
state
to
while
the
republic
of
the
united
states
was
so
divided
and
agitated
as
to
matters
of
policy
touching
the
interests
of
all
the
union
there
were
at
the
same
time
many
issues
of
local
importance
confined
to
north
carolina
the
old
habit
of
annually
changing
the
place
for
holding
the
sessions
of
the
legislature
had
first
brought
about
a
feeling
of
sectionalism
between
the
eastern
and
western
counties
western
men
had
first
learned
to
combine
in
securing
hillsboro
rather
than
new
bern
for
this
purpose
it
was
natural
and
right
for
them
to
seek
to
lessen
as
much
as
possible
the
distance
that
separated
the
state
capital
from
their
homes
the
western
counties
were
also
anxious
to
change
the
system
of
representation
so
that
their
weight
in
population
should
be
felt
in
legislation
as
it
was
the
east
held
control
of
both
houses
of
the
general
assembly
hertford
with
five
hundred
voters
had
exactly
the
weight
of
buncombe
or
orange
with
its
thousands
eastern
men
would
not
consent
to
modify
this
hardship
they
insisted
that
the
halifax
constitution
was
still
to
be
adhered
to
and
refused
to
go
into
a
constitutional
convention
for
fear
of
changes
that
might
subject
eastern
wealth
to
taxation
in
order
to
secure
the
construction
of
highways
in
the
west
on
the
morning
of
the
of
june
the
capitol
at
raleigh
was
burned
the
fire
was
caused
by
the
carelessness
of
a
workman
who
was
covering
the
roof
the
building
was
a
total
loss
as
was
also
the
beautiful
statue
of
washington
which
stood
in
the
rotunda
a
new
capitol
was
erected
upon
the
site
of
the
old
building
by
act
of
the
legislature
of
it
is
an
elegant
structure
and
was
built
of
native
granite
at
a
cost
of
over
a
half
million
of
dollars
the
burning
of
the
capitol
or
as
it
was
called
was
a
calamity
and
inconvenience
but
the
chief
regret
was
over
the
loss
of
the
marble
statue
of
washington
this
fine
work
had
recently
been
received
from
the
famous
sculptor
canova
in
italy
and
was
said
to
be
one
of
his
finest
productions
note
by
a
freak
of
liberality
unusual
in
those
good
old
days
when
the
state
never
spent
over
ninety
thousand
dollars
a
year
for
all
purposes
when
taxes
were
six
cents
on
the
one
hundred
dollars
value
of
real
estate
only
and
personal
property
was
entirely
exempt
the
general
assembly
had
placed
in
the
rotunda
a
magnificent
statue
of
washington
of
carrara
marble
by
the
great
canova
it
was
the
pride
and
boast
of
the
state
our
people
remembered
with
peculiar
pleasure
that
la
fayette
had
stood
at
its
base
and
commended
the
beauty
of
the
carving
and
fitness
of
the
honor
to
the
great
man
under
whom
he
had
served
in
our
war
of
independence
and
whom
he
regarded
with
a
passionate
and
reverential
love

the
day
of

a
political
convention
composed
of
gentlemen
from
the
western
portion
of
the
state
met
in
raleigh
it
was
presided
over
by
bartle
yancey
the
object
of
the
convention
was
to
devise
measure
to
secure
greater
weight
in
the
legislature
to
their
great
and
growing
popular
majorities
many
wise
and
desirable
changes
in
the
constitution
of
were
suggested
and
the
result
was
that
sectional
feeling
ran
very
high
so
much
so
that
in
time
the
people
of
the
west
might
have
proceeded
to
extreme
measures
had
not
the
legislature
of
come
to
the
rescue
in
the
passage
of

convention

on
a
close
vote
aided
by
the
votes
of
eastern
borough
members
the
bill
was
passed
which
provided
that
in
case
a
call
for
a
convention
therein
contained
should
be
endorsed
by
a
majority
of
the
voters
in
the
state
then
a
convention
should
be
held
and
each
member
chosen
before
taking
his
seat
should
take
oath
that
he
would
not
be
a
party
to
any
further
alterations
of
the
constitution
than
those
specified
in
the
enabling
act

met
in

abolished
the

was
taken
from
the
assembly
and
committed
to
the
people
the
legislative
sessions
were
made
biennial
instead
of
annual
as
of
old
each
county
was
to
send
one

to

house
of

and
more
if
its

justified
so
doing
one
hundred

constituted
this
body
while
the
senators
were
limited
to
fifty
the
upper
house
was
to
represent
taxation
and
the
lower
population
these
organic
changes
were
ratified
by
a
popular
majority
of
more
than
five
thousand
votes
this
change
of

was
soon
followed
by
the
first
popular
election

last
time
selected
a

person
of
richard

this
gentleman
did
not
equal
his
father
in
the
brilliance
of

was
well
fitted
for
the
exigencies
of
a
contest

came
near

duel
between

two
gentlemen

it
was
amicably
settled

was
no
further
in

life

to
preside
over

ornaments
his
strong
natural
understanding
was
further
improved
by
his
learning
but
in
addition
to
this
he
possessed
qualities
which
peculiarly
fitted
him
for
framing
the
practice
and
precedents
of
a
new
tribunal
he
was
an
eminently
wise
and
just
man

well
deserved

origin
of
the
public
schools
to
it
will
be
remembered
that
in
the
first
school
was
incorporated
by
the
legislature
of
north
carolina
by
the
act
in
favor
of
the
academy
at
new
bern
in
this
and
subsequent
legislation
for
schools
at
edenton
and
elsewhere
it
had
provided
that
the
teachers
should
all
be
communicants
of
the
church
of
england
this
stipulation
was
of
course
part
of
the
english
church
and
state
system
of
government
when
just
previous
to
the
outbreak
of
the
revolutionary
war
the
founders
of
the
queen
museum
at
charlotte
a
school
so
named
in
honor
of
the
queen
of
england
asked
incorporation
of
the
colonial
general
assembly
it
was
not
granted
for
the
reason
that
this
institution
was
presbyterian
both
as
to
trustees
and
faculty
up
to
that
period
dissenting
ministers
had
not
been
allowed
any
legal
recognition
and
it
was
considered
a
great
concession
that
the
presbyterian
clergy
were
allowed
to
officiate
at
marriages
during
the
revolution
in
the
useful
seminary
at
charlotte
was
first
legally
chartered
as
liberty
hall
it
was
in
no
way
sustained
by
or
connected
with
the
state
but
was
to
the
presbytery
of
orange
what
davidson
college
is
now
to
the
synod
of
north
carolina
and
was
sustained
solely
by
the
contributions
and
patronage
of
private
citizens
indeed
this
had
been
the
case
all
along
with
the
chartered
schools
of
new
bern
and
edenton
in
when
the
convention
at
halifax
framed
the
first
constitution
for
the
state
among
the
leading
ordinances
of
that
instrument
was
that
for
the
state
active
aid
to
the
education
of
the
people
with
this
clause
in
the
constitution
which
they
all
swore
to
uphold
the
legislators
had
done
nothing
so
far
except
to
provide
in
for
the
establishment
of
the
university
at
chapel
hill
of
the
halifax
constitution
declared
that
a
school
or
schools
shall
be
established
by
the
legislature
for
the
convenient
instruction
of
youth
with
such
salaries
to
the
masters
paid
by
the
public
as
may
enable
them
to
instruct
at
low
prices
all
useful
learning
shall
be
duly
encouraged
and
promoted
in
one
or
more
universities
this
disregard
of
their
organic
law
on
the
part
of
those
constituting
the
state
government
was
deeply
regretted
by
many
wise
and
good
men
but
only
a
few
dared
to
encounter
the
opposition
to
taxation
for
popular
education
governors
johnston
and
davie
in
former
days
and

murphy
and

for

fearful
of

for

reasons
had
held

also
the

invested
for

as

it
left
to

county
the
option
of
schools
or
no

it
showed
considerable
advance
in

wisdom
that
all
but
one
of

decided
to
have

and
to
be
taxed
for
the

as
were
necessary
in

work
note
the
presidential
campaign
of
was
an
unusually
exciting
one
the
whig
nominee
william
henry
harrison
was
charged
by
his
opponents
as
having
lived
in
a
log
cabin
with
nothing
to
drink
but
hard
cider
his
friends
made
good
use
of
these
charges
hard
cider
became
a
political
watchword
and
in
the
numerous
whig
processions
a
log
cabin
on
wheels
occupied
the
most
prominent
and
honored
position
the
log
cabin
campaign
will
long
be

slavery
and
social
development
to
when
the
year
of
our
lord
had
come
peace
and
prosperity
were
in
all
portions
of
north
carolina
society
was
still
divided
into
three
classes
these
were
the
white
people
the
slaves
and
the
free
negroes
the
latter
class
had
originated
by
manumission
and
were
numerous
in
some
of
the
eastern
counties
they
had
lost
the
right
of
suffrage
by
the
action
of
the
state
convention
of
this
action
on
the
part
of
the
convention
was
due
in
some
degree
doubtless
to
the
constant
agitation
of
the
slavery
question
though
by
no
means
due
to
that
alone
but
to
the
further
fact
as
well
that
during
the
time
they
voted
by
sufferance
they
had
plainly
demonstrated
their
utter
unfitness
to
appreciate
or
exercise
the
great
right
of
suffrage
as
a
class
they
were
unthrifty
and
dishonest
and
each
year
becoming
more
useless
as
members
of
the
community
their
association
with
the
slaves
was
regarded
as
an
evil
to
be
avoided
if
possible
therefore
they
were
discriminated
against
in
the
legislation
of
the
period
virginia
and
ohio
had
both
enacted
statutes
which
forbade
them
access
to
their
borders
north
carolina
provided
by
law
that
in
case
of
their
removal
from
the
state
they
lost
their
residence
and
were
forbidden
to
return
the
right
of
the
states
to
pass
such
laws
for
the
protection
of
their
slave
property
can
not
be
denied
unless
the
right
of
property
in
slaves
be
also
denied
nor
can
they
properly
be
called
unjust
the
right
of
property
in
their
slaves
the
people
of
north
carolina
regarded
as
settled
by
the
constitution
of
the
state
and
that
of
the
united
states
theorists
might
speculate
whether
african
slavery
was
consistent
with
the
american
declaration
of
independence
as
they
pleased
but
the
right
of
property
in
slaves
was
undisputably
recognized
and
secured
in
the
fundamental
laws
of
the
land
as
to
the
moral
question
involved
if
any
such
there
was
the
southern
regarded
it
as
one
between
himself
and
his
god
and
not
between
himself
and
his
northern
brother
as
a
matter
of
course
slavery
and
intellectual
culture
are
incompatible
and
education
was
therefore
denied
the
slaves
the
right
to
testify
in
the
courts
against
a
white
man
and
even
the
right
to
defend
himself
from
the
assaults
of
white
men
except
in
defence
of
life
in
the
last
extremity
were
also
necessarily
denied
him
these
restrictions
were
necessary
to
the
maintenance
of
the
legal
relations
between
the
dominant
and
subject
races
of
course
there
were
those
who
studied
the
slavery
problem
from
every
possible
standpoint
except
the
constitutional
legality
of
it
that
at
least
was
fixed
some
doubted
the
morality
of
it
and
others
questioned
the
policy
of
it
and
it
is
quite
possible
had
time
and
opportunity
for
gradual
manumission
and
exportation
offered
north
carolina
would
have
been
a
free
state
in
the
course
of
events
of
her
own
accord
the
northern
states
had
sold
their
slaves
rather
than
free
them
under
their
acts
of
manumission
it
was
not
possible
for
this
to
be
further
repeated
by
the
commonwealths
still
retaining
the
institution
so
in
a
blind
ignorance
of
the
future
and
in
utter
hopelessness
of
any
practicable
solution
of
their
difficulty
except
in
remaining
as
they
were
the
statesmen
of

that
men
were
everywhere
resolved
on
revolution
or
amendment
north
carolina
formed
no
exception
to
this
general
impulse
of
christendom
a
wise
and
patriotic
disregard
of
old
sectional
and
party
traditions
first
led
to
the
assumption
by
the
state
of
a
controlling
part
in
the
great
work
of
internal
improvement
the
railroads
that
had
been
previously
constructed
from
different
points
to
roanoke
river
were
all
in
a
deplorable
condition
the
raleigh
and
gaston
route
was
so
decayed
and
impaired
in
its
equipments
that
a
whole
day
was
consumed
in
the
passage
of
a
mail
train
over
the
eighty
miles
traversed
the
seaboard
route
to
portsmouth
virginia
was
prostrate
and
out
of
use
the
wilmington
road
though
it
was
in
somewhat
better
plight
was
still
served
by
feeble
engines
which
drew
a
few
trains
slowly
along
the
track
ironed
no
more
heavily
than
the
wheels
of
a
horse
wagon
the
additional
fact
that
no
railway
went
further
west
than
the
village
of
raleigh
also
prevented
the
accumulation
of
such
travel
and
traffic
as
to
repay
the
outlay
of
construction
and
equipment
the
wilmington
road
furnished
the
great
route
between
the
north
and
south
and
in
that
way
won
richer
returns
than
lines
leading
to
the
interior
the
long
deferred
hopes
of
western
north
carolina
were
at
last
to
be
realized
morehead
and
others
besought
the
legislature
for
the
state
aid
in
a
great
line
which
should
connect
charlotte
greensboro
raleigh
and
goldsboro
this
was
to
be
called
the
north
carolina
railroad
and
was
to
be
two
hundred
and
forty
miles
long
eastern
men
as
a
general
thing
opposed
this
bill
but
it
was
earnestly
supported
by
william
ashe
of
new
hanover
and
others
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
having
passed
that
body
it
was
sent
to
the
senate
the
vote
in
the
upper
house
resulted
in
a
tie
calvin
graves
of
caswell
was
speaker
he
had
been
a
democrat
and
knew
that
the
people
of
his
county
were
opposed
to
the
state
aiding
the
proposed
road
but
he
nobly
discharged
what
he
thought
to
be
his
duty
and
by
his
casting
vote
the
bill
became
a
law
this
great
step
in
building
up
the
material
prosperity
of
the
commonwealth
did
not
satisfy
the
desires
of
this
memorable
assembly
measures
that
had
been
adopted
at
the
previous
session
for
the
establishment
of
an
institution
for
the
education
of
the
deaf
dumb
and
the
blind
children
of
the
state
were
extended
and
at
the
earnest
solicitation
of
miss
dorothea
dix
of
new
york
a
further
appropriation
was
made
for
the
erection
of
a
hospital
for
the
insane
miss
dix
devoted
her
life
to
the
amelioration
of
this
unfortunate
class
of
people
in
north
carolina
as
generally
in
the
republic
there
had
been
no
better
disposition
of
lunatics
than
their
confinement
in
the
loathsome
dungeons
of
county
jails
numbers
who
might
have
been
restored
to
reason
and
usefulness
were
in
this
way
condemned
to
the
horrors
of
perpetual
insanity
instead
of
the
comforts
kindness
and
restoration
now
to
be
found
in
the
management
of
the
insane
asylums
the
poor
lunatic
lay
in
chains
in
the
murderer
cell
and
howled
out
his
life
amid
the
darkness
and
foetid
exhalations
of
the
hell
to
which
he
was
doomed
north
carolina
was
thus
manfully
meeting
the
requirements
of
both
civilization
and
humanity
for
as
the
condition
of
their
highways
affords
the
truest
test
of
a
people
advancement
in
civilization
so
also
does
the
provision
made
for
the
care
and
comfort
of
the
unfortunate
and
helpless
afford
the
highest
evidence
of
a
people
progress
in
humanity
in
this
memorable
session
of
a
still
further
exemplification
of
the
wisdom
of
the
north
carolina
legislature
was
seen
in
their
statute
for
the
protection
of
married
women
before
that
time
the
husband
acquired
by
marriage
absolute
title
to
his
wife
personal
estate
and
a
life
interest
in
her
real
property
and
these
interests
he
could
sell
without
her
consent
he
could
also
restrain
her
of
her
personal
liberty
the
statute
of
this
year
provided
that
the
husband
interest
in
the
wife
lands
should
not
be
subject
to
sale
by
the
husband
without
her
full
and
free
consent
and
joinder
in
the
conveyance
this
was
to
be
attested
by
a
privy
examination
and
certificate
appended
to
the
deed
conveying
such
lands
a
further
much
needed
improvement
took
place
when
the
ancient
english
rules
allowing
the
husband
the
right
of
personal
chastisement
were
also
abolished
and
this
infamous
badge
of
inferiority
numbered
among
the
things
of
the
past
there
have
been
periods
in
the
history
of
all
communities
when
extraordinary
development
was
witnessed
the
overthrow
of
one
ancient
abuse
leads
to
the
correction
of
another
and
thus
in
the
awakening
sympathies
of
the
hour
reformations
give
way
to
a
new
and
higher
humanity

applying
for

the
spectre
of
coming

was
seen
in
the
renewal
of
the
struggle
over
the
question
of
freedom
or
slavery
in
this
new
sister
in
the
galaxy
of
states
southern
men
like
henry
clay
thought
that
the
whole
subject
had
been
settled
in
when
by
the
missouri
compromise
it
had
been
ordained
that
involuntary
servitude
should
not
obtain
north
of
the
geographical
line
north
latitude
it
was
understood
that
the
surrender
of
the
right
to
own
slaves
north
of
this
line
was
the
consideration
for
the
admission
of
the
right
to
own
them
south
of
it
and
that
this
was
what
the
compromise
meant
but
they
were
told
that
the
inhibition
alone
was
effective
and
that
no
such
converse
right
was
intended
to
be
conveyed
as
that
contended
for
by
the
men
of
the
south
the
most
logical
of
these
men
said
that
congress
had
exceeded
its
powers
in
the
enactment
mentioned
and
that
no
power
could
settle
the
question
but
the
people
of
the
new
state
it
was
seen
that
wilmot
proviso
which
was
an
amendment
continually
offered
by
wilmot
of
pennsylvania
excluding
slavery
from
all
future
states
was
the
fixed
determination
of
the
northern
people
so
after
a
protracted
and
bitter
struggle
clay
as
the
last
service
of
a
long
and
illustrious
life
procured
the
passage
of
the
compromise
of
in
which
the
only
concession
by
northern
men
was
the
fugitive
slave
law
this
statute
provided
that
federal
courts
and
officers
should
arrest
and
return
to
their
owners
such
slaves
as
should
be
found
absconding
in
the
different
states
of
the
union
whether
free
or
it
was
greeted
by
a
prodigious
outcry
from
the
northern
press
and
people
they
determined
that
this
national
law
should
not
be
executed
and
the
different
legislatures
of
the
free
states
began
their
enactment
of
personal
liberty
laws
which
made
it
penal
to
aid
in
carrying
out
the
law
of
congress
the
people
of
the
south
were
both
exasperated
and
disheartened
at
such
manifestations
and
in
view
of
such
palpable
violations
of
their
plain
constitutional
rights
began
seriously
to
consider
whether
in
a
union
with
the
northern
states
the
arbitrary
will
of
the
people
of
those
states
was
not
to
be
the
rule
of

rather
than
the
constitution
solemnly
agreed
upon

by
many
as
a
rebuke
to
those
who
had
been
so
clamorous
in

was
a
warm
supporter

the
knowledge

this

the
minds

north

just
entered

evidences

widespread
prosperity

began
to
invest
their

the
creation
of
the
office
of
superintendent
of
common
schools
in

the
appointment
of
calvin
wiley
of
guilford
to
that
position
marked
an
extraordinary
advance
in
the
matter
of
popular
education
wiley
soon
evinced
so
much
discretion
and
devotion
to
his
duties
that
his
propositions
of
improvement
were
adopted
and
his
views
and
wishes
soon
became
those
of
the
state
government
the
same
year
was
further
signalized
by
the
normal
school
under
charge
of

being
empowered
by

to
grant
literary
degrees
and
the
assumption
of

full
dignities
of
a
college
after
nearly
thirty
years
of
usefulness
this
institution
now
known
as
trinity
college
is
still
accomplishing
great
good
under
the
auspices
of
the
methodists
of
the
state
with
the
new
lines
of
railway
and
the
restoration
of
the
old
routes
there
was
a
large
advance
in
the
value
of
real
estate
and
in
the
amount
of
productions
sent
abroad
the
use
of
peruvian
guano
and
other
concentrated

was
just
being
introduced
and
the
example
of
edgecombe
county
in
the
use
of
compost
heaps
was
being
followed
in
every
direction
and
adding
immensely
to
the
yield
of
exhausted
fields
it
was
a
notable
thing
in
the
political
history
of
the
country
that
in
the
presidential
contest
of
the
candidates
for
of
both
the
whig
and

parties
were
born
in

was

who
had
been
secretary
of

in
the
cabinet
of

fillmore
the
churches
were
prospering
under
their
increased
attentions
to
education
a
larger
culture
was
coming
to
those
who
filled
the
pulpits
at
home
and
devoted
men
like
matthew
yates
were
going
to
heathen
lands
to
spend
their
lives
for
the
good
of
other
races
the
episcopal
church
had
abundant
compensation
in
the
wisdom
and
virtues
of
bishop
atkinson
for
the
loss
of
bishop
ives
upon
his
leaving
that
communion
for
the
church
of

the
great
slavery
controversy
was
bringing
trouble
and
division
to
the
baptists
and
methodists
and
thus
not
only
statesmen
and
politicians
but
ministers
of
the
gospel
were
also
set
at
variance
from
massachusetts
was
sent
at
this
period
a
new
and
startling
impulse
to
the
northern
pulpits
and
hustings
it
had
been
the
peculiar
glory
of
the
american
people
that
they
were
the
originators
of
the
great
doctrine
and
practice
of
religious
liberty
a
new
party
calling
themselves
the
knownothings
had
carried
that
state
and
were
proclaiming
their
opposition
to
all
roman
catholics
as
public
officers
the
were
also
called
the
american
party
and
their
motto
was
america
for
americans
this
was
to
prove
a
and
pernicious
movement
it
not
only
contravened
the
noblest
american
precedents
but
at
once
combined
all
the
ends
and
fragments
of
parties
which
had
previously
opposed
the
great
organization
that
had
been
led
by
jefferson
and
jackson
besides
their
hostility
to
the
roman
catholic
religion
they
inculcated
one
other
principle
this
was
opposition
to
the
naturalization
of
foreign
immigrants
until
after
a
residence
of
years
within
the
borders
of
the
united
states
the
success
of
this
new
party
ended
in
the
virginia
campaign
between
governor
wise
and
flournoy
about
this
time
another
party
began
to
be
prominent
in
the
northern
states
it
was
called
the
republican
party
and
was
the
outgrowth
of
the
notorious
controversy
over
the
passage
of
the
act
through
congress
this
statute
was
in
effect
but
a
continuance
of
the
legislation
in
regard
to
california
and
amounted
to
little
beyond
transferring
the
question
of
slave
or
free
territory
from
congress
to
the
new
states
the
north
however
was
fanatically
bent
on
the
destruction
of
slavery
everywhere
within
the
united
states
and
would
not
consent
that
each
new
state
should
settle
the
question
for
itself
on
the
contrary
it
was
determined
to
prohibit
the
spread
of
slavery
whether
the
people
in
the
new
states
and

from

in

and
the

to
after
seventy
years
of
party
struggles
touching
the
relations
of
the
general
government
to
the
individual
states
the
presidential
contest
of
opened
with
such
notes
of
violence
and
public
confusion
that
it
was
at
once
seen
that
at
last
the
supreme
crisis
had
come
the
only
issue
apparently
before
the
american
people
was
that
of
slavery
in
the
territories
the
democrats
were
divided
into
two
fragments
those
supporting
judge
douglas
for
the
presidency
advocated
squatter
sovereignty
the
breckinridge
men
said
that
the
question
of
slavery
should
only
be
settled
as
to
the
new
states
at
their
constitutional
conventions
while
republicans
supporting
abraham
lincoln
proclaimed
that
only
the
enactment
of
the
wilmot
proviso
would
satisfy
them
the
whig
candidates
bell
and
everett
and
the
whig
party
were
silent
on
all
these
stormy
differences
and
were
not
of
much
significance
in
the
general
upheaval
back
of
this
question
however
about
slavery
in
the
territories
and
involved
in
it
was
the
real
issue
between
the
republican
and
democratic
parties
and
that
was
whether
the
federal
constitution
should
be
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
the
right
of
property
in
slaves
was
guaranteed
by
that
constitution
and
if
the
republican
party
could
thus
destroy
that
right
it
might
when
it
so
pleased
destroy
any
and
all
other
rights
the
democrats
hold
that
the
constitution
was
supreme
the
republicans
held
that
there
was
a
still
higher
law
unwritten
and
undefined
one
was
certainty
the
other
chaos
it
was
seen
at
an
early
period
of
the
contest
that
the
bulk
of
the
southern
people
would
be
found
supporting
breckinridge
and
lane
it
was
generally
held
in
all
the
states
that
the
election
of
lincoln
would
be
significant
of
a
purpose
among
northern
men
to
disregard
their
rights
and
that
the
inauguration
of
the
abolition
policy
by
the
federal
officers
would
compel
and
justify
the
secession
of
the
southern
states
from
the
union
lane
was
born
in
buncombe
county
in
this
state
and
was
the
cousin
of
colonel
joel
lane
who
once
owned
the
lands
upon
which
raleigh
was
built
he
had
served
gallantly
as
a
brigadier
general
in
mexico
afterwards
in
congress
and
as
governor
of
oregon
when
in
november
it
was
known
that
the
republicans
had
triumphed
in
the
national
election
and
that
abraham
lincoln
would
be
chosen
president
of
the
united
states
by
a
majority
of
the
electors
in
the
different
state
electoral
colleges
then
it
was
realized
that
the
extreme
southern
states
would
at
an
early
period
sever
their
connection
with
the
government
at
washington
south
carolina
and
others
said
that
protection
of
their
property
would
now
be
impossible
in
the
union
and
therefore
before
the
inauguration
of
president
lincoln
on
march
seven
states
had
assembled
conventions
and
by
their
ordinances
declared
the
ties
formerly
binding
them
to
the
republic
of
the
united
states
null
and
void
on
the
of
january
the
legislature
then
in
regular
session
passed
by
a
large
majority
in
each
house
an
act
declaring
that
in
its
opinion
the
condition
of
the
country
was
so
perilous
that
the
sovereign
people
of
the
state
should
assemble
in
convention
to
effect
an
honorable
adjustment
of
the
difficulties
whereby
the
federal
union
is
endangered
or
otherwise
to
determine
what
action
will
best
preserve
the
honor
and
promote
the
interest
of
north
carolina
at
the
same
time
that
the
delegates
were
to
be
elected
the
act
required
that
the
sense
of
the
people
should
be
taken
whether
there
should
be
a
convention
at
all
or
not
the
election
was
held
on
of
february
and
upon
the
question
of
convention
or
no
convention
the
official
count
showed
a
majority
of
votes
against
convention
that
is
to
say
votes
for
convention
and
votes
against
convention
the
vote
of
davie
county
which
was
not
received
in
time
to
be
counted
would
have
increased
the
majority
against
convention
some
votes
how
the
delegates
elected
were
divided
in
sentiment
on
the
day
of
election
can
not
be
ascertained
nor
was
such
division
to
be
relied
upon
for
changes
were
daily
taking
place
and
men
no
matter
how
reluctantly
were
rapidly
coming
to
believe
that
in
united
action
by
the
south
lay
the
only
hope
for
the
future
in
april
president
lincoln
in
consequence
of
the
attack
upon
and
capture
of
fort
sumter
required
of
governor
ellis
north
carolina
proportion
of
an
army
of
seventy
five
thousand
men
which
was
to
be
used
in
the
coercion
of
the
seceded
states
this
demand
governor
ellis
promptly
refused
and
he
at
once
convened
the
legislature
in
special
session
declaring
in
his
proclamation
that
the
time
for
action
had
come
and
upon
his
recommendation
twenty
thousand
volunteers
were
called
for
by
the
general
assembly
to
sustain
north
carolina
in
her
course
a
state
convention
was
called
by
the
legislature
on
the
first
of
may
and
met
on
the
of
may
in
the
hall
of
the
house
of
commons
on
this
anniversary
of
the
mecklenburg
declaration
the
ordinance
of
secession
was
passed
and
north
carolina
made
haste
to
connect
herself
with
the
confederate
states
of
america
the
ordinance
of
secession
was
as
follows
an
ordinance
dissolving
the
union
between
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
the
other
states
united
with
her
under
the
compact
of
government
entitled
constitution
of
the
united
we
the
people
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
in
convention
assembled
do
declare
and
ordain
and
it
is
hereby
declared
and
ordained
that
the
ordinance
adopted
by
the
state
of
north
carolina
in
the
convention
of
whereby
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
ratified
and
adopted
and
also
all
acts
and
parts
of
acts
of
the
general
assembly
ratifying
and
adopting
amendments
to
the
said
constitution
are
hereby
repealed
rescinded
and
abrogated
we
do
further
declare
and
ordain
that
the
union
now
subsisting
between
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
the
other
states
under
the
title
of
united
states
of
america
is
hereby
dissolved
and
that
the
state
of
north
carolina
is
in
full
possession
and
exercise
of
all
those
rights
of
sovereignty
which
belong
and
appertain
to
a
free
and
independent
state
the
number
of
submissionists
in
north
carolina
was
very
small
and
the
real
differences
of
opinion
did
not
so
much
regard
final
action
in
the
crisis
as
they
did
the
way
and
the
time
in
which
it
should
be
reached
many
preferred
separate
state
action
many
others
preferred
concert
of
action
among
the
states
some
preferred
immediate
action
others
thought
it
advisable
to
wait
until
some
actual
overt
act
as
it
was
called
was
committed
by
the
new
administration
but
no
matter
how
much
people
were
divided
on
these
points
on
one
point
they
were
a
unit
that
is
to
say
in
the
desire
that
final
action
should
represent
as
near
as
possible
every
phase
of
public
sentiment
and
to
secure
this
greatly
to
be
desired
unanimity
in
action
many
personal
preferences
and
original
opinions
were
sacrificed
many
good
people
had
hoped
and
prayed
that
the
troubles
between
the
north
and
south
would
be
peaceably
arranged
but
all
hope
of
such
a
blessing
was
now
lost
and
the
whole
state
resounded
with
the
notes
of
preparation
for
the
war
in
every
county

pressed
forward
by
thousands
to

at
the
call

in

stages

with
great
resolution
he
addressed
himself
to
the

onerous

chapter
lv
the
war
between
the
states
the
people
of
north
carolina
loved
the
union
of
states
that
had
been
in
such
large
part
constructed
by
the
heroism
and
wisdom
of
their
own
fathers
they
well
knew
its
value
to
themselves
under
an
unbroken
federal
constitution
they
knew
too
the
danger
incurred
in
the
attempt
to
absolve
them
selves
from
further
federal
connections
but
they
knew
also
their
rights
under
the
constitution
and
were
fully
determined
neither
to
surrender
them
nor
to
aid
in
the
subjugation
of
their
sister
states
as
the
state
had
entered
the
union
by
action
of
a
convention
of
her
own
people
she
now
resolved
to
leave
it
in
the
same
manner
for
more
than
a
month
before
the
memorable
day
of
may
when
the
secession
ordinance
was
passed
troops
were
volunteering
and
being
received
by
governor
ellis
from
many
portions
of
the
state
the
first
ten
companies
were
embodied
in
a
regiment
of
which
major
daniel
hill
was
elected
colonel
by
the
commissioned
officers
they
were
at
once
sent
to
yorktown
in
virginia
on
june
general
benjamin
butler
who
was
in
command
of
the
united
states
forces
at
fortress
monroe
in
virginia
sent
a
column
of
troops
up
the
peninsula
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
possibility
of
reaching
richmond
which
city
had
recently
become
the
capital
of
the
southern
confederacy
early
the
next
morning
the
federal
advance
became
confused
in
the
darkness
and
two
of
their
regiment
fired
upon
each
other
at
big
bethel
on
the
they
found
the
regiment
of
colonel
hill
supporting
a
battery
of
the
richmond
howitzers
there
were
also
present
two
infantry
and
three
cavalry
companies
belonging
to
virginia
this
force
was
assailed
by
the
federal
army
but
the
attack
was
repelled
and
the
assailants
retired
in
disorder
to
old
point
comfort
only
one
confederate
soldier
was
killed
in
the
action
and
that
was
private
henry
wyatt
of
edgecombe
county
he
belonged
to
captain
company
and
was
the
first
southern
soldier
slain
in
the
war
between
the
states
the
whole
affair
was
insignificant
both
as
to
the
number
engaged
and
the
results
achieved
but
was
hailed
as
a
happy
omen
by
the
south
north
carolina
with
all
her
deliberation
in
taking
part
in
the
struggle
was
thus
to
afford
the
first
martyr
of
the
south
and
was
present
with
her
troops
to
arrest
the
first
federal
invasion
of
southern
soil
on
the
and
days
of
july
occurred
much
greater
and
more
serious
conflicts
at
manassas
and
bull
run
also
in
virginia
another
federal
army
commanded
by
general
irvin
mcdowell
and
numbering
more
than
forty
thousand
men
left
washington
with
orders
to
attack
the
confederates
under
general
beauregard
the
fifth
sixth
and
regiments
of
north
carolina
troops
were
present
and
gallantly
aided
in
the
federal
defeat
colonel
charles
fisher
was
especially
valuable
in
the
aid
he
rendered
in
restoring
a
ditched
train
to
the
track
and
thus
making
possible
the
timely
approach
of
the
reinforcements
under
general
kirby
smith
which
so
speedily
resulted
in
the
flight
of
general
mcdowell
army
it
is
mournful
to
add
that
after
performing
this
signal
service
and
after
gallantly
capturing
the
celebrated
rickett
battery
colonel
fisher
was
slain
in
the
battle
he
fell
at
the
head
of
his
regiment
beyond
the
battery
and
still
in
pursuit
of
the
enemy
this
memorable
victory
was
very
grateful
to
the
south
but
it
did
not
delude
the
people
into
the
belief
that
the
war
was
at
an
end
it
was
useful
too
in
that
it
gave
them
time
to
prepare
for
the
greater
conflicts
still
to
come
it
had
been
hoped
by
lincoln
and
his
advisers
that
all
southern
opposition
would
be
overcome
in
ninety
days
but
at
bull
run
and
manassas
they
were
convinced
that
only
by
a
great
and
prolonged
struggle
were
such
adversaries
to
be
subdued
the
short
periods
of
enlistment
were
abandoned
by
both
sides
and
the
winter
was
spent
in
preparation
for
a
gigantic
struggle
in
the
spring
it
was
early
seen
in
north
carolina
that
fortifications
were
necessary
at
hatteras
for
the
defence
of
the
many
broad
waters
covering
so
large
a
portion
of
the
eastern
counties
a
small
known
as
fort

with
an
outlying
flank

was
the
only
reliance
for
the
protection
of
albemarle
and
pamlico
sounds
before
these
weak
defences
a
large
federal
fleet
appeared
on
august
and
by
means
of
its
superior
armament
lay
securely
beyond
the
range
of
the
guns
mounted
in
fort
hatteras
while
pouring
in
a
tremendous
discharge
of
shot
and
shell
the
federals
having
effected
a
landing
on
the
beach
and
most
of
the
caution
being
dismounted
in
the
fort
it
was
thought
best
by
colonel
martin
on
the
to
surrender
the
fort
in
two
days
operations
the
whole
tier
of
eastern
counties
was
thus
laid
bare
to
the
incursions
of
federal
troops
and
cruisers
there
was
great
sorrow
for
the
captured
garrison
and
general
alarm
and
uneasiness
but
the
spirit
of
resistance
was
undaunted
and
troops
continued
volunteering

chapter
lvi
the
combat
deepens
by
the
fortune
of
war
in
the
revolution
as
again
in
the
state
was
nearly
always
left
with
a
small
proportion
of
her
own
troops
to
defend
the
home
of
their
birth
so
also
when
the
spring
opened
in
though
fully
forty
thousand
men
of
the
state
were
under
arms
they
were
to
be
found
in
virginia
and
south
carolina
except
a
small
force
left
at
wilmington
and
roanoke
island
this
condition
of
affairs
did
not
result
however
from
any
indifference
on
the
part
of
the
general
government
to
us
but
from
the
fact
that
the
main
strategic
points
were
in
other
states
and
fortunate
it
was
for
north
carolina
that
this
was
so
for
whatever
may
have
been
the
necessities
of
local
defence
or
the
evils
incident
to
an
unprotected
coastline
or
those
inseparable
from
its
occupation
by
the
enemy
at
various
points
they
can
not
be
compared
to
the
evils
resulting
from
the
prolonged
occupation
of
a
state
by
large
contending
armies
roanoke
island
was
the
only
hope
of
defence
for
albemarle
sound
and
the
many
rivers
flowing
therein
to
defend
it
general
henry
a
wise
was
sent
with
a
small
force
to
be
added
to
the
eighth
and
regiments
of
north
carolina
volunteers
he
was
sick
on
february
when
general
burnside
with
a
great
fleet
and
fifteen
thousand
federal
troops
sailed
up
croatan
sound
and
began
the
attack
colonel
henry
shaw
of
the
eighth
north
carolina
regiment
was
in
command
and
made
a
gallant
but
unavailing
defence
the
federals
landed
and
moved
up
the
island
in
the
rear
of
the
forts
which
had
been
constructed
to
prevent
the
passage
of
vessels
to
the
west
of
the
defences
the
only
recourse
left
was
to
abandon
the
lower
batteries
and
concentrate
the
southern
troops
at
a
point
near
the
centre
of
roanoke
island
it
was
hoped
that
the
morasses
indenting
both
shores
and
leaving
a
narrow
isthmus
would
enable
the
small
confederate
force
to
defend
that
position
but
the
bravery
and
enterprise
of
the
enemy
enabled
him
to
turn
both
flanks
and
nothing
was
left
colonel
shaw
and
his
command
but
to
fall
back
to
the
northern
end
of
the
island
and
there
lay
down
their
arms
the
battle
had
been
bravely
fought
for
two
days
and
the
two
thousand
confederate
prisoners
and
their
gallant
leader
became
captives
but
only
after
inflicting
heavy
loss
upon
the
assailants
the
place
was
untenable
against
superior
naval
appliances
and
quite
men
enough
had
been
sacrificed
in
view
of
the
impossibility
of
preventing
its
isolation
by
federal
fleets
very
different
were
the
defensive
capacities
of
the
city
of
new
bern
it
was
immediately
foreseen
that
this
important
place
would
be
next
assailed
and
with
enough
troops
it
would
have
been
an
easy
feat
to
have
held
it
indefinitely
but
whether
its
value
as
a
strategic
point
would
have
justified
such
a
defence
may
be
doubted
the
confederate
authorities
entrusted
its
defence
to
general
branch
who
had
no
experience
in
military
affairs
and
in
whose
command
like
general
wise
was
not
a
single
regiment
that
had
been
under
fire
though
there
were
skillful
officers
of
lower
rank
who
had
seen
much
service
in
the
old
army
on
march
general
burnside
with
the
army
and
fleet
so
lately
the
victors
at
roanoke
moved
to
attack
the
forts
which
had
been
constructed
just
below
the
junction
of
neuse
and
trent
rivers
general
branch
had
in
his
command
the
seventh
and
north
carolina
regiments
a
portion
of
the
nineteenth
cavalry
with
brem
and
latham
light
batteries
and
a
small
force
of
militia
these
were
disposed
along
a
line
stretching
from
fort
thompson
on
neuse
river
across
the
railroad
to
an
impassable
swamp
which
afforded
abundant
protection
to
his
right
flank
the
battle
began
at
seven
in
the
morning
and
raged
until
noon
the
federal
attacks
were
repeatedly
repelled
until
by
the
fatal
flight
of
the
militia
in
the
centre
the
confederate
lines
were
broken
and
a
precipitate
retreat
ensued
general
branch
lost
two
hundred
prisoners
and
seventy
men
killed
and
wounded
and
besides
these
all
his
guns
and
stores
he
was
beaten
in
his
first
battle
when
perhaps
naught
but
defeat
was
expected
but
he
soon
won
high
reputation
as
a
brave
soldier
and
skillful
officer
victory
is
not
always
possible
to
the
best
generalship
he
met
in
a
few
days
at
kinston
reinforcements
that
would
have
enabled
him
to
hold
his
ground
at
new
bern
but
like
many
other
earthly
succors
they
came
too
late
for
real
benefit
the
fall
of
new
bern
sealed
the
fate
of
the
confederate
forces
at
fort
macon
colonel
i
white
with
five
companies
of
the
tenth
regiment
artillery
endured
the
federal
bombardment
until
the
work
was
in
danger
of
being
blown
up
he
surrendered
the
fort
on
april
these
disasters
at
home
were
indeed
calculated
to
dishearten
but
the
only
visible
effect
upon
the
people
at
large
was
to
increase
the
numbers
of
those
who
were
still
volunteering
by
thousands
to
defend
north
carolina
and
the
confederate
states
in
the
spring
of
general
mcclellan
the
federal
commander
having
determined
to
make
his
advance
on
richmond
by
way
of
james
river
and
having
made
his
preparations
to
that
effect
general
johnston
transferred
the
confederate
troops
from
manassas
to
the
peninsula
between
the
james
and
york
rivers
thus
placing
his
army
between
mcclellan
and
richmond
at
williamsburg
occurred
the
first
memorable
conflict
of
the
year
between
the
two
great
armies
struggling
on
the
soil
of
the
old
dominion
in
this
conflict
the
charge
of
the
fifth
north
carolina
regiment
under
colonel
macrae
excited
the
admiration
and
its
terrible
losses
the
sympathy
of
both
friend
and
foe
in
the
bloody
and
glorious
campaign
in
the
shenandoah
valley
general
jackson
grew
immortal
before
the
coming
of
midsummer
the
gallantry
of
the
north
carolina
regiment
at
winchester
like
that
of
the
fourth
at
seven
pines
was
as
conspicuous
as
bloody
in
this
latter
battle
where
so
many
other
men
of
the
state
were
slain
the
fourth
regiment
under
colonel
george
anderson
lost
four
hundred
and
men
out
of
five
hundred
and
twenty
in
the
last
days
of
june
nearly
all
of
the
north
carolina
regiments
and
many
southern
troops
were
concentrated
around
richmond
under
the
command
of
general
robert
lee
in
place
of
general
johnston
who
had
been
wounded
at
seven
pines
in
the
week
of
battle
which
ended
in
the
overthrow
of
the
great
investing
army
of
general
mcclellan
they
lost
thousands
of
their
bravest
and
best
regiments

these
were
the
forces
that
drove
the
federals
to
their
ships
and
of
these
regiments

to
north

it
may
be
safely

more

prove
powerless
before

by

he
disappeared
amid

but
exactly
how
and
when
was
never
known
in
north
carolina
there
had
been
comparative
quiet
through
the
spring
and
summer
months
the
federal
garrisons
at
plymouth
and
new
bern
were
watched
by
small
bodies
of
confederates
but
no
fighting
occurred
except
in
plymouth
which
town
was
taken
and
held
for
a
few
hours
by
colonel
martin
with
the
seventeenth
regiment
and
then
abandoned
because
of
the
federal
on
blackwater
river
just
below

in

there
was
a
gallant
conflict
of
a

ruffin
of

and
a

the

were
all
driven
from

came
up

desperate

it
was
this
battle
that
heights
won
its
bloody
fame
the
gallantry
of
the

especially
of

was
magnificent
simultaneously

the

in

bloody
and
wasting

there
was
nothing
to
indicate
any
solution
of
the
great
controversy
many
bloody
battles
had
been
fought
thousands
of
homes
were
saddened
in
the
loss
of
brave
and
true
men
and
yet
both
sides
were
as
intent
as
ever
upon
carrying
on
indefinitely
the
terrible
and
costly
struggle
lincoln
and
the
government
at

said
there
should
be
no
peace
until
the
seceded
states
returned
to

davis
and
the
government
at

said
on

hand
that
the
seceded
states
were
of
right
free
and
independent
states
that
had
rightfully
resumed
their
delegated
powers
and
owed
no
allegiance
to

government
it
was
hoped
that
england
and
france
would
recognize
the
independence
of
the
confederate
states
but
beyond
extending
to
the
southern
government
the
rights
of
belligerents
this
trust
proved
utterly
fallacious
confederate
agents
were
received
and
armed
vessels
allowed
to
enter

but
no

was
extended
to

the

commissioners
mason

on

steamer
by
a

war
vessel
was
resented
by

and
war
seemed
probable
but
these
southern
envoys
were
released

no
aid
came
from
abroad
except
in
the
ships
that
were
bought
of
private
persons
for
the
purpose
of
cruising
against
vessels
belonging
to
citizens
of
the
united

among
the
earliest
measures
adopted
by
the
federal

was
the
blockade
of
the
southern
seaports
wilmington
charleston
savannah
mobile
and
galveston
were
all
watched
by
armed
ships
that
sought
to
exclude
the
vessels
of
all
countries
from
entering
these
harbors
cruisers
swarmed
along
the
whole
southern
coast
and
it
became
a
matter
of
great
peril
and
difficulty
to
send
out
or
bring
in
any
commodity
by
way
of
the
ocean
this
soon
led
to
a
scarcity
of
salt
sugar
coffee
molasses
and
everything
which
had
been
formerly
imported
from
europe
or
bought
of
northern
merchants
prices
continually
advanced
as
such
things
became
more
scarce
in
the
south
wilmington
is
so
situated
that
an
effective
blockade
there
was
almost
impossible
there
were
two
inlets
and
therefore
two
blockade
fleets
were
necessary
and
even
with
this
added
difficulty
the
blockading
squadron
could
not
prevent
on
dark
nights
the
passage
of
swift
steamers
that
swept
in
and
out
of
the
cape
fear
river
and
brought
from
nassau
and
bermuda
what
was
most
needed
for
the
armies
and
people
soon
after
his
inauguration
governor
vance
at
general
martin
suggestion
sent
colonel
thomas
crossan
to
england
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
a
ship
to
supply
the
wants
of
north
carolina
crossan
had
been
a
naval
officer
in
the
service
of
the
united
states
and
had
judgment
enough
in
such
matters
to
select
one
of
the
swiftest
ships
in
the
world
it
was
called
the
lord
clyde
abroad
but
that
name
was
changed
to
the
and
the
vessel
made
many
successful
voyages
before
she
was
captured
in
the
superior
clothing
and
equipments
of
the
north
carolina
troops
were
the
wisdom
and
activity
of
the
state
government
manifested
and
too
not
only
were
the
necessities
of
our
own
soldiers
supplied
but
large
aid
was
extended
to
the
troops
of
other
states
besides
this
cotton
and
woolen
cards
and
many
other
necessaries
were
brought
in
and
distributed
to
the
different
sections
of
the
state
salt
was
the
most
important
of
all
the
domestic
supplies
excluded
by
the
blockade
to
procure
this
indispensable
article
private
factories
on
the
seacoast
were
supplemented
by
others
under
state
management
but
these
proved
insufficient
to
meet
popular
wants
and
arrangements
were
made
to
procure
additional
supplies
from
the
salt
wells
of
southwestern
virginia
it
was
early
foreseen
that
in
so
great
a
struggle
enormous
expenditures
would
become
necessary
and
to
meet
such
liabilities
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
confederacy
and
the
individual
states
to
use
their
credit
in
procuring
supplies
on
the
faith
of
future
payments
many
millions
of
dollars
were
to
be
expended
and
only
confederate
and
state
obligations
would
be
available
to
meet
such
purchases
unhappily
the
great
supply
of
cotton
then
in
the
south
was
not
utilized
by
the
authorities
and
thus
a
solid
basis
of
credit
was
lost
and
a
favorite
theory
is
that
had
all
the
cotton
been
promptly
seized
by
the
government
and
sent
to
foreign
ports
the
depreciation
of
its
funds
would
have
been
averted
but
whether
this
could
have
been
done
is
to
say
the
least
by
no
means
certain
as
it
was
in
both
confederate
and
state
money
began
to
depreciate
in
value
and
this
depreciation
once
begun
had
no
stop
in
its
downward
tendency

nearly
all

many
of

interest
was
awakened
by

were
so
bravely
battling

took
them
by
assault
capturing
more
than
three
thousand
prisoners
the
help
of
the
albemarle
was
very
efficacious
on
this
occasion

her
combat
at

of

of

to
assume
the
direction
of
affairs
in

with
the
vast
numbers
at
his
command
he
resolved
upon
such
strategy
as
fell
with
fearful
results
upon

army
but
it
weakened
the
reduced

confederates
at

lost
more

in

it

who
fell
at

there
were

greatly
applauded
by

on

in
the
steady
depreciation

money
was
the
greatest
calamity
of
all
the
cry
of
distress
from
famishing
women
and
children
was
increasing
in
volume
and
the
state
and
county
authorities
were
finding
it
more
and
more
impossible
to
meet
by
public
charity
the
pressing
wants
of
their
people
the

may
be
easily
imagined
how
great
was
the

when
it
is
remembered
that
numbers
of
soldiers

were
almost
entirely
dependent
upon
the

for
support
there
were
relief
committees
throughout
the

but
the
great
scarcity
of
provisions
made
them
almost
helpless
almost
all
the
white
men
in
north
carolina
were
in
the
ranks
of
the
different
regiments
and
battalions
mustered
into
the
confederate
service
their
families
were
largely
dependent
upon
the
pay
they
received
as
soldiers
when
the
confederate
money
became
worthless
want
and
suffering
appeared
in
every
section
and
unhappy
wives

many
a

the

he
was

handed
the

the

he
had
received
from
his

my
dear

i
have
always
been
proud
of
you

since
your
connection
with

i
have
been
prouder
of
you
than
ever
before
i
would
not
have
you
do
anything
wrong
for
the

but
before

must
die

was
aroused
by

eddie

he
said
o

i
am
so
hungry
and
lucy
edward
your
darling
lucy
she
never

she
is
growing

every

found
him
guilty

sentenced
him
to
death

lxi
north

and
to
in
colonel
vance
was
governor
of
north
carolina
at
his
first
election
he
was
personally
very
popular
was
a
soldier
in
the
field
had
been
in
actual
battle
had
been
by
no
means
a
strong
union
man
in
the
earlier
portions
of
the
year
and
indeed
in
may
of
that
year
was
in
camp
at
the
head
of
his
company
johnston
his
opponent
was
a
secessionist
but
neither
popular
nor
a
soldier
and
comparatively
but
little
known
to
the
mass
of
the
people
except
in
his
own
immediate
section
of
the
state
everybody
of
every
shade
of
opinion
had
the
fullest
confidence
that
colonel
vance
would
do
his
whole
duty
there
was
no
expectation
that
johnston
would
be
elected
nor
any
serious
effort
made
in
his
behalf
in
his
course
as
governor
such
strenuous
support
was
given
to
the
confederate
states
that
when
his
term
of
service
approached
conclusion
and
a
new
election
was
to
be
held
a
few
men
who
had
been
among
his
most
zealous
friends
two
years
before
but
who
now
opposed
the
determined
attitude
of
the
confederacy
and
of
north
carolina
were
found
opposing
his
continuance
as
governor
these
comprised
a
small
fragment
of
the
people
and
william
holden
of
wake
was
their
candidate
and
this
was
all
the
opposition
governor
vance
had
holden
was
the
editor
of
the
standard
a
newspaper
that
had
in
years
past
been
extreme
in
southern
proclivities
and
he
had
advocated
and
signed
the
ordinance
of
secession
but
of
late
he
had
advocated
north
carolina
withdrawal
from
the
confederacy
and
the
making
of
separate
terms
with
the
powers
at
washington
governor
vance
and
the
people
except
the
handful
of
followers
both
in
and
out
of
the
army
opposed
this
project
as
dishonorable
and
unjust
to
their
compatriots
of
other
states
they
held
that
north
carolina
fortunes
were
inseparable
from
those
of
the
other
southern
states
and
that
she
must
share
their
fate
whatever
that
might
be
about
this
time
several
propositions
looking
to
overtures
to
lincoln
for
peace
were
communicated
to
governor
vance
from
certain
members
of
the
confederate
congress
from
other
states
but
he
refused
to
take
any
part
in
such
a
scheme
he
was
elected
by
an
overwhelming
majority
after
a
thorough
exposition
of
his
views
by
many
addresses
both
to
the
people
at
home
and
to
the
north
carolina
soldiers
in
their
camps
as
general
grant
massed
fresh
thousands
of
troops
before
petersburg
and
the
confederate
resistance
grew
more
feeble
in
the
shenandoah
valley
the
conference
which
took
place
at
old
point
comfort
was
arranged
to
no
purpose
after
a
mighty
struggle
the
south
in
utter
exhaustion
was
soon
to
lay
down
the
arms
that
had
been
so
bravely
wielded
the
importance
of
wilmington
to
the
waning
fortunes
of
the
confederacy
had
long
been
evident
in
the
closing
of
other
seaports
by
blockade
general
whiting
was
an
able
and
experienced
engineer
and
his
main
defence
fort
fisher
on
new
inlet
was
pronounced
by
general
beauregard
as
almost
impregnable
forts
caswell
and
holmes
at
the
mouth
of
cape
fear
river
and
the
numerous
works
fringing
both
banks
of
the
stream
from
wilmington
to
the
ocean
had
apparently
rendered
hostile
approach
from
that
direction
a
thing
almost
impossible
to
any
naval
expedition
on
december
the
same
general
butler
who
had
been
at
the
capture
of
fort
hatteras
in
came
with
an
army
which
was
borne
in
a
great
fleet
commanded
by
admiral
porter
this
vast
armada
carrying
six
hundred
of
the
heaviest
cannon
modern
science
has
been
able
to
construct
opened
fire
upon
fort
fisher
the
fort
was
reinforced
by
a
few
companies
from
other
portions
of
general
whiting
command
and
later
the
division
of
general
hoke
arrived
from
petersburg
and
took
position
in
the
intrenched
camp
at
sugar
loaf
four
miles
distant
up
the
river
general
braxton
bragg
had
been
for
some
time
in
command
of
the
department
and
was
present
on
this
occasion
all
day
on
that
christmas
sabbath
a
fiery
storm
of
shot
and
shell
was
rained
upon
the
fort
which
answered
slowly
and
deliberately
from
its
different
batteries
in
the
midst
of
the
bombardment
general
butler
landed
his
army
on
the
peninsula
above
the
of
the
work
but
upon
inspection
of
its
strength
he
grew
hopeless
of
his
undertaking
and
on
the
night
of
december
having
his
force
the
fleet
returned
to
beaufort
there
was
much
joy
and
relief
in
this
evident
federal
confirmation
of
the
reported
impregnability
of
the
great
work
and
congratulations
went
around
among
the
confederates
over
this
defeat
of
the
costly
undertaking
of
the
invaders
general
bragg
withdrew
hoke
division
and
all
the
force
at
sugar
loaf
except
adams
light
battery
and
the
cavalry
with
the
intention
of
attacking
the
garrison
of
new
bern
he
was
signally
interrupted
in
this
undertaking
when
on
the
night
of
the
of
january
colonel
william
lamb
telegraphed
from
fort
fisher
that
the
fleet
had
returned
and
the
troops
were
disembarking
for
a
renewal
of
the
attack
general
bragg
hurried
hoke
and
all
other
available
commands
back
to
the
rescue
but
found
the
federal
army
in
complete
possession
of
the
ground
between
the
fort
and
intrenched
camp
upon
a
reconnaissance
the
enemy
were
found
too
strongly
posted
to
be
assailed
the

opened
fire
upon
the
and
having
dismounted
all
but
one
of
the
heavy
guns
defending
that
flank
on
the
evening
of
the
general
terry
by
signal
changed
the
fire
of
the
fleet
to
the
batteries
the
three
federal
brigades
that
had
worked
their
way
close
up
sprang
forward
in

that
resulted
in
the
capture
of
seven
traverses
and
four
hundred
prisoners
the
assailants
lost
their
three
commanders
and
five
hundred
men
it
was
a
fatal
blow
the
federals
could
not
be
dislodged
and
after
brave
and
unavailing
combat
within
the
works
fort
fisher
was
taken
and
its
garrison
numbering
two
thousand
men
became

gathered

at

collected

at

on

halted
near

it
seemed
impossible
that
he
would
be
able
to
meet
the
combined
strength
of
the
three
armies
assembling
at

but
the
result
at

had
greatly
elated
his
troops

resolutely
awaited

bloodshed
the

at

forks
on

the
loss
of
the
six
thousand
confederates
made
prisoners
on

and
then
emigrated
to
tennessee
where
he
became
a
very
prominent
citizen
when
the
war
came
on
he
adhered
to
the
federal
side
and
was
very
bitter
and
harsh
in
his
hostility
to
the
south
he
was
rewarded
for
his
course
by
election
to
the
of
the
united
states
in
in
the
violent
excitement
which
followed
upon
the
killing
of
president
lincoln
johnson
would
not
sanction
the
liberal
terms
of
surrender
which
general
sherman
had
granted
to
general
johnston
although
general
sherman
had
been
in
conference
with
the
deceased
statesman
just
previous
to
his
death
and
was
following
his
directions
as
to
the
treatment
of
the
conquered
south
notwithstanding
this
refusal
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
carry
out
the
agreement
of
the
military
commissioners
the
army
of
general
johnston
was
surrendered
at
greensboro
on
april
and
sent
home
on
parole
on
like
terms
with
the
confederate
troops
at
appomattox
general
schofield
was
made
military
governor
of
north
carolina
and
his
first
official
act
was
a
proclamation
declaring
freedom
to
the
slaves
in
the
state
after
two
centuries
of
servitude
these
people
were
at
last
delivered
from
their
bondage
it
is
difficult
at
this
day
to
say
who
were
the
more
blessed
in
this
deliverance
the
slaves
or
their
masters
it
was
a
hard
thing
for
men
who
had
been
reared
in
the
south
to
realize
that
their
principal
property
guaranteed
to
them
as
it
was
in
the
fundamental
law
of
the
land
was
founded
in
injustice
and
still
harder
was
it
to
accept
poverty
on
the
strength
of
a
sentiment
human
nature
is
selfish
in
all
regions
and
that
southern
men
should
have
clung
to
their
property
is
no
more
than
what
their
opponents
would
have
done
had
the
circumstances
been
exchanged
it
will
be
difficult
for
posterity
to
understand
what
a
mighty
revolution
in
the
domestic
life
of
the
people
was
involved
in
this
single
act
of
an
army
officer
note
in
the
state
election
of
the
total
vote
polled
was
the
largest
that
had
ever
been
polled
north
carolina
furnished
to
the
confederacy
over
men
or
quite
as
many
soldiers
as
she
had
voters
during
the
four
years
of
the
war
the
total
number
of
troops
furnished
by
all
the
states
of
the
confederacy
was
about
and
it
will
be
seen
that
north
carolina
furnished
of
the
entire
force
raised
by
the
confederate
government
during
the
war
at
appomattox
north
carolina
surrendered
twice
as
many
muskets
as
did
any
other
state
and
at
greensboro
more
of
her
soldiers
were
among
the
paroled
than
from
any
of
her
sister
states
north
losses
by
the
casualties
of
the
war
were
largely
over
men
our
living
and
our
dead
the
slaves
had
been
looking
forward
with
hope
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
that
freedom
might
be
in
store
for
them
yet
almost
all
of
them
had
remained
in
quiet
subjection
at
their
homes
while
the
war
was
progressing
it
seemed
hard
for
them
to
realize
for
some
time
that
they
were
at
last
the
masters
of
their
own
movements
as
a
general
thing
they
continued
quietly
at
labor
on
the
farms
of
their
former
owners
until
the
crops
that
were
growing
were
complete
in
their
tillage
or
as
they
expressed
it
laid
by
governor
vance
was
soon
arrested
and
imprisoned
in
the
old
capitol
at
washington
president
davis
was
also
captured
and
imprisoned
johnson
appointed
vance
late
political
antagonist
holden
provisional
governor
and
at
the
same
time
removed
from
office
every
state
and
county
official
in
north
carolina
for
some
weeks
no
officer
with
civil
powers
was
to
be
seen
and
to
the
commanders
of
the
many
federal
posts
alone
could
the
peaceful
have
looked
for
protection
against
violence
and
fraud
no
man
ever
had
so
great
an
opportunity
for
fixing
himself
in
the
esteem
and
affection
of
the
people
as
governor
holden
had
during
his
administration
as
provisional
governor
and
no
man
ever
so
completely
threw
golden
opportunities
away
had
he
risen
to
the
full
height
of
a
patriot
his
name
would
today
be
a
loving
household
word
in
every
section
of
the
state
but
he
did
not
and
such
opportunities
rarely
occur
twice
to
any
man
his
career
had
not
been
an
uneventful
one
of
humble
origin
he
had
by
dint
of
his
own
work
and
his
own
brains
carried
himself
to
the
control
of
the
democratic
party
in
the
state
he
was
not
satisfied
with
the
position
of
the
editor
of
the
chief
organ
of
the
dominant
party
and
the
pecuniary
profits
that
then
resulted
from
such
a
position
but
desired
to
be
made
governor
of
the
state
he
was
defeated
for
the
nomination
by
judge
ellis
before
the
democratic
state
convention
at
charlotte
and
from
that
period
dates
his
downward
career
he
advocated
the
douglas
movement
and
then
supported
breckinridge
and
lane
he
voted
for
and
signed
the
ordinance
of
secession
declaring
he
intended
to
preserve
as
an
heirloom
in
his
family
the
pen
with
which
he
attached
his
name
to
the
ordinance
and
then
he
became
the
head
and
front
of
the
union
element
in
the
state
during
the
war
at
the
close
of
the
war
as
we
have
seen
he
was
made
provisional
governor
by
president
johnson
no
man
knew
better
than
governor
holden
that
on
our
side
the
war
was
entirely
at
an
end
when
the
troops
laid
down
their
arms
and
that
when
the
people
of
north
carolina
renewed
their
allegiance
to
the
federal
government
they
intended
to
stand
to
it
honestly
and
faithfully
none
better
than
he
knew
that
they
desired
nothing
so
much
as
to
set
themselves
to
the
task
of
rebuilding
their
fallen
fortunes
he
knew
too
that
they
were
well
aware
that
before
this
could
be
done
civil
government
with
all
its
varied
machinery
must
be
and
that
in
all
that
was
right
and
proper
for
a
people
so
situated
they
were
ready
to
aid
him
in
doing
this
the
returned
soldiers
too
especially
felt
that
of
them
some
recognition
was
due
for
the
honorable
terms
and
respectful
treatment
accorded
to
them
at
appomattox
and
greensboro
in
such
mood
it
would
have
been
an
easy
task
for
a
ruler
who
was
both
patriot
and
statesman
to
federal
authority
in
north
carolina
it
was
simply
impossible
to
punish
all
who
had
fought
against
the
federal
government
it
was
quite
as
impossible
to
expect
the
many
who
had
fought
against
it
to
take
part
in
punishing
the
few
amnesty
and
oblivion
on
one
side
renewed
allegiance
and
strict
observer
of
the
laws
on
the
other
plainly
constituted
the
true
solution
of
the
problem
unfortunately
the
partisan
prevailed
over
the
patriot
instead
of
granting
amnesty
and
oblivion
treason
was
to
be
made
odious
and
traitors
to
be
punished
instead
of
making
the
path
easy
back
to
the
union
it
was
constantly
blocked
up
in
every
possible
way
by
both
state
and
federal
authority

an
era
of
bitterness
began
which
the
long
imprisonment

judicial
murders
of
mrs
surratt
and
henry

the
protracted
exclusion
of
the
southern
states
from
all
participation
in

general

the

consumed

consequence
the

jonathan

was
chosen
over

holden
as
the
state
was
apparently
resuming
its
and
was
soon
to
show
that
some
spirit
was
left
in
the
people
they
refused
to
ratify
the
ordinances
of
the
late
convention
by
a
decided
majority
and
while
accepting
the
situation
and
submitting
in
all
quietude
to
the
authorities
imposed
they
were
yet
resolved
to
take
no
part
in
these
constrained
reformations
the
general
government
had
been
for
four
years
declaring
the
ordinances
of
secession
passed
by
the
several
states
null
and
void
it
had
been
repeatedly
announced
that
no
state
could
thus
sever
her
connection
with
the
union
but
when
the
legally
elected
senators
and
representatives
from
north
carolina
reached
washington
they
found
that
this
doctrine
was
reversed
and
were
told
that
they
could
not
take
part
in
national
legislation
until
congress
should
restore
the
southern
states
to
their
lost
privileges
in
the
southern
elections
that
were
held
every
man
was
required
to
take
oaths
of
allegiance
and
for
the
support
of
the
amended
federal
constitution
some
refused
to
attend
the
polls
and
a
few
left
the
country
for
foreign
lands
a
vast
majority
were
resolved
to
support
the
union
in
good
faith
but
unhappily
this
was
not
so
understood
by
the
men
who
controlled
at
raleigh
and
washington
they
were
impressed
with
the
belief
that
only
hostile
sentiments
actuated
southern
white
men
and
therefore
the
proper
policy
was
to
confer
political
power
upon
the
negroes
and
in
that
way
establish
a
new
system
of
rule
and
social
life
in
the
southern
states
lately
in
revolt
this
was
a
great
and
cruel
mistake
in
policy
it
was
not
only
impossible
of
execution
but
necessarily
entailed
trouble
and
suffering
on
both
races
thus
put
in
antagonism
it
could
not
be
expected
that
white
people
would
quietly
submit
to
the
domination
of
negroes
who
had
so
recently
been
their
slaves
even
if
such
rulers
had
been
equally
intelligent
and
socially
respected
when
the
race
feeling
was
added
to
the
late
subjection
and
present
ignorance
of
the
negroes
it
was
the
most
futile
and
abortive
scheme
ever
proposed
in

and
president
johnson
to
president
andrew
johnson
as
has
already
been
stated
was
born
and
reared
in
the
city
of
raleigh
he
went
to
tennessee
after
reaching
manhood
and
though
blessed
with
small
advantages
as
to
early
culture
devoted
himself
to
political
life
he
is
said
to
have
mastered
the
rudiments
of
education
with
his
wife
help
his
native
ability
soon
gave
him
position
as
a
politician
and
eventually
great
popularity
and
control
over
the
tennessee
people
he
soon
relaxed
in
the
severity
of
his
feelings
toward
the
late
confederates
and
thereby
incurred
the
resentment
of
the
leaders
in
the
party
which
had
elected
him
in
the
bitterness
of
the
mutual
recriminations
between
him
and
his
late
friends
in
congress
there
was
unhappily
evil
to
result
to
north
carolina
and
the
south
for
to
the
old
resentments
against
the
south
was
added
a
desire
in
many
men
to
thwart
the
president
who
had
become
their
ally
governor
worth
had
ever
been
marked
as
a
public
man
by
the
utmost
devotion
to
the
federal
union
he
had
constantly
opposed
the
doctrine
and
necessity
of
secession
he
was
now
to
show
his
wisdom
and
attachment
for
the
state
of
his
birth
as
governor
he
was
continually
pressed
to
secure
legal
protection
for
the
people
against
the
interference
of
military
commanders
and
which
were
constantly
intruding
upon
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts
the
whole
system
of
education
in
the
common
schools
had
perished
in
the
loss
of
the
literary
fund
the
university
still
continued
its
ministrations
but
with
a
diminished
faculty
and
patronage
the
colleges
male
and
female
belonging
to
the
different
religious
denominations
were
and
generally
were
slowly
regaining
their
former
efficiency
among
the
first
enactments
by
the
legislature
after
the
war
was
the
law
allowing
negroes
to
testify
against
or
for
white
parties
in
courts
of
justice
this
was
a
great
change
in
our
law
but
was
now
necessary
for
their
protection
as
they
no
longer
had
masters
to
care
for
them
the
agriculture
of
the
period
was
rapidly
advancing
in
the
perfection
of
its
details
concentrated
fertilizers
were
coming
into
general
use
and
the
area
of
cotton
culture
was
immensely
expanding
the
farms
were
about
equally
divided
as
to
the
style
of
their
management
the
best
farmers
still
hired
their
hands
and
superintended
the
details
of
operation
in
person
but
many
leased
their
lands
to
laborers
and
furnished
the
teams
and
supplies
needed
by
the
tenants
under
the
sensible
and
moderate
rule
then
seen
in
the
state
prosperity
seemed
rapidly
returning
but
as
the
united
states
congress
still
refused
to
allow
any
representation
in
that
body
there
was
great
and
increasing
uneasiness
as
to
the
terms
that
would
be
finally
exacted
from
the
south
in
the
proposed
reconstruction
measures
early
in
the
year
a
convention
was
held
to
frame
a
new
constitution
under
the
reconstruction
act
of
congress
the
election
for
the
delegates
was
held
under
general
canby
orders
and
the
returns
were
sent
to
him
at
charleston
upon
his
order
the
convention
met
and
upon
his
order
its
delegates
were
seated
and
unseated
in
the
latter
part
of
april
the
constitution
thus
framed
was
submitted
to
such
of
the
people
as
were
allowed
to
vote
at
an
election
held
as
before
under
general
canby
order
and
by
him
in
charleston
south
carolina
the
returns
having
been
sent
to
him
there
declared
to
have
been
adopted
it
is
now
generally
known
as
the
canby
constitution
in
june
by
order
by
telegram
from
general
canby
governor
worth
who
had
been
elected
governor
by
the
people
in
was
turned
out
of
his
office
and
governor
holden
put
in
his
place
the
only
authority
for
this
and
other
outrages
was
the
might
of
federal
bayonets
the
legislature
elected
under
the
recently
adopted
constitution
met
on
the
of
july
it
was
comprised
largely
of
negroes
and
of
men
from
the
north
who
had
lately
come
to
north
carolina
these
latter
were
popularly
known
as
carpetbaggers
and
as
a
class
were
mere
birds
of
prey
who
came
here
for
plunder
as
might
have
been
expected
the
legislation
of
such
a
body
was
both
corrupt
and
injurious
ignorant
of
the
resources
of
the
state
of
its
people
and
their
necessities
it
would
have
been
a
miracle
almost
no
matter
how
honest
had
their
legislation
not
been
harmful
unfortunately
there
was
added
to
gross
ignorance
the
most
unblushing
corruption
and
wanton
extravagance
many
millions
of
debt
in
the
shape
of
special
tax
bonds
as
they
were
called
were
attempted
to
be
fastened
upon
the
state
by
this
legislature
but
the
people
have
persistently
refused
to
recognize
them
the
convention
and
elections
of
will
ever
be
remembered
the
act
of
congress
passed
on
february
was
in
vain
vetoed
by
the
president
it
was
made
the
law
of
the
land
and
under
its
provisions
while
twenty
thousand
white
men
of
north
carolina
were
deprived
of
the
right
to
vote
that
privilege
was
extended
to
every
colored
male
in
the
state
who
had
attained
the
age
of
years
the
year
closed
with
great
apprehensions
to
all
classes
the
new
state
government
possessed
neither
the
confidence
nor
the
affection
of
the
people
and
in
the
pandemonium
of
bribery
and
corruption
there
was
justification
for
the
fears
of
men
who
in
corrupt
and
reckless
appropriations
and
corrupt
and
reckless
expenditures
foresaw
ruin
to
all
material
interests
of
the
state
in
robeson
county
life
and
property
were
so
insecure
that
extraordinary
measures
were
adopted
to
extirpate
the
bandits
who
slew
and
plundered
as
if
no
legal
restraints
were
left
in
the
land
the
story
of
henry
berry
lowery
and
his
swamp
angels
will
ever
stand
as
a
convincing
proof
of
the
incompetency
of

chapter
lxvi
the
results
of
reconstruction
to
there
was
in
north
carolina
great
indignation
at
the
result
of
the
enforced
changes
wrought
in
the
polity
of
the
state
by
means
of
the
various
congressional
enactments
strangers
from
other
states
and
men
entirely
unused
to
legislation
had
effected
many
alterations
in
our
government
and
laws
it
was
to
be
expected
that
such
things
done
in
such
manner
would
prove
distasteful
to
a
proud
race
that
had
so
lately
withstood
so
stoutly
on
the
field
of
battle
and
so
long
such
superior
numbers
among
the
many
unnecessary
changes
that
were
rendered
more
distasteful
by
the
harsh
manner
of
their
accomplishment
were
those
made
by
governor
holden
and
his
party
at
the
state
university
at
chapel
hill
this
venerable
institution
which
had
given
education
to
many
men
of
renown
was
taken
in
hand
and
with
a
new
management
and
a
new
faculty
made
up
of
carpetbaggers
and
unsuitable
native
north
carolinians
its
doors
its
late
president
david
swain
had
died
shortly
after
his
removal
his
colleagues
in
the
faculty
had
dispersed
in
search
of
new
homes
and
silence
had
usurped
the
halls
so
long
thronged
by
students
from
many
states
the
village
of
chapel
hill
depending
on
the
existence
of
the
university
for
its
support
became
almost
deserted
no
less
than
thirty
of
its
best
families
removed
within
two
years
the
people
of
north
carolina
refused
to
patronize
the
new
organization
and
the
institution
was
for
seven
years
prostrate
the
changes
did
not
stop
with
the
university
the
judges
of
all
the
courts
had
been
since
elected
by
the
legislature
this
was
altered
so
that
they
were
in
future
to
be
selected
by
the
votes
of
the
people
the
name
of
the
lower
branch
of
the
general
assembly
so
long
known
as
the
house
of
commons
became
that
of
the
representatives
the
meeting
of
the
assembly
was
made
annual
instead
of
biennial
and
the
pay
of
the
members
and
state
officials
largely
increased
our
county
government
system
too
was
changed
and
so
was
the
mode
of
electing
magistrates
who
had
hitherto
been
elected
by
the
legislature
in
future
they
were
to
be
elected
by
the
people
in
many
portions
of
the
state
the
effect
was
to
put
the
white
race
at
once
under
the
domination
of
the
black
race
bitterness
and
great
excitement
were
the
inevitable
results
but
of
all
the
innovations
none
perhaps
was
so
startling
as
that
made
in
the
procedure
and
practice
of
the
courts
it
was
distasteful
both
to
client
and
counsel
but
to
the
older
lawyers
it
was
especially
objectionable
the
distinguishing
event
of
this
year
in
north
carolina
was
the
appearance
in
various
parts
of
the
state
of
bodies
of
horsemen
commonly
called
who
rode
about
at
night
in
full
disguise
and
punished
crimes
that
the
law
had
failed
to
punish
the
mystery
attending
their
coming
and
their
going
the
silence
they
preserved
in
their
marches
the
disguises
they
wore
coupled
with
the
terrible
punishment
they
inflicted
struck
terror
into
the
hearts
of
men
with
guilty
consciences
these
midnight
riders
were
doubtless
in
their
origin
the
natural
outgrowth
of
the
condition
of
society
that
had
prevailed
in
north
carolina
for
some
time
past
that
is
to
say
they
were
originally
nothing
more
nor
less
than
local
mutual
protective
associations
with
little
form
about
them
and
but
little
more
secrecy
the
first
step
having
been
taken
in
that
direction
the
next
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
next
came
associations
to
prevent
future
crime
by
punishing
past
crime
these
organizations
were
more
complex
in
their
character
and
of
wider
range
in
their
operations
the
condition
of
society
was
very
bad
but
not
worse
than
might
have
been
expected
under
a
government
which
obnoxious
in
its
creation
daily
became
more
hateful
in
its
conduct
negro
suffrage
had
just
become
a
reality
spies
and
eavesdroppers
were
everywhere
catching
up
men
words
and
watching
men
actions
for
report
to
the
government
at
raleigh
corruption
and
licentiousness
stalked
openly
in
the
legislative
halls
and
sat
unblushingly
on
the
judicial
bench
while
in
the
executive
office
was
a
governor
ready
to
obey
the
behests
of
his
party
at
any
cost
it
was
an
era
of
extravagance
bribery
corruption
oppression
licentiousness
and
lawlessness
of
the
negroes
ignorant
slaves
but
yesterday
with
all
their
passion
stirred
to
the
utmost
large
numbers
blindly
believed
that
freedom
and
suffrage
would
make
them
masters
tomorrow
were
it
not
for
the
native
white
race
first
suspicious
then
sullen
then
aggressive
they
soon
came
under
the
bad
teaching
of
the
men
who
were
their
leaders
to
regard
the
native
white
men
as
their
born
enemies
the
result
was
the
murder
of
men
the
outraging
of
women
the
burning
of
barns
and
other
like
destruction
of
property
then
of
vital
importance
for
the
law
had
no
terror
for
an
evil
doer
who
had
friends
at
court
or
in
the
executive
chamber
it
is
but
just
to
the
negroes
however
to
say
that
it
is
not
believed
that
if
they
had
been
left
to
themselves
they
would
have
acted
as
they
did
but
that
they
were
influenced
to
bad
deeds
by
bad
white
men
who
used
them
as
tools
to
accomplish
political
ends
under
such
circumstances
as
these
good
citizens
felt
that
they
were
tried
beyond
human
endurance
and
justified
themselves
to
their
own
consciences
for
taking
the
law
into
their
own
hands
the
evils
the
came
to
cure
were
indeed
unbearable
but
it
must
be
said
also
that
while
the
disease
was
desperate
the
remedy
was
fearful
it
is
a
fearful
thing
for
men
to
band
themselves
together
in
secret
and
take
the
law
into
their
own
hands
and
nothing
but
the
direst
necessity
and
the
gravest
emergency
can
ever
justify
it
inseparable
from
every
such
organization
and
this
proved
no
exception
to
the
rule
is
the
danger
of
its
easy
perversion
to
the
gratification
of
personal
malice
or
the
improper
punishment
of
petty
offences
and
this
alone
ought
to
be
warning
that
in
such
a
remedy
lies
terrible
danger
governor
holden
quailed
before
the
and
from
his
guarded
house
issued
proclamation
after
proclamation
but
they
would
not
down
at
his
bidding
when
winter
came
and
with
it
the
legislature
senator
shoffner
of
alamance
at
the
instance
of
the
governor
introduced
a
bill
into
the
senate
in
its
terms
conferring
upon
the
governor
the
right
to
declare
any
and
every
county
in
the
state
to
be
in
insurrection
and
to
recruit
and
maintain
an
army
whenever
he
saw
proper
in
other
words
the
bill
sought
to
confer
upon
the
governor
the
power
to
declare
martial
law
at
will
of
course
this
was
unconstitutional
the
shoffner
bill
was
ratified
on
the
of
january
on
the
night
of
the
of
february
wyatt
outlaw
a
negro
was
hung
in
the
county
town
of
alamance
by
the
on
the
of
march
the
county
was
declared
to
be
in
a
state
of
insurrection
federal
troops
were
sent
there
but
beyond
eating
their
rations
they
had
no
occupation
for
quiet
and
good
order
prevailed
throughout
the
county
a
striking
fact
true
of
every
place
during
these
unhappy
times
is
that
whenever
white
federal
troops
were
sent
to
a
troubled
section
whether
in
alamance
caswell
orange
or
elsewhere
there
was
straightway
an
end
of
trouble
the
breakers
were
awed
into
good
behavior
and
those
who
in
protection
had
forced
in
their
own
judgment
to
take
into
their
own
hands
the
administration
of
justice
of
course
had
no
further
occasion
to
do
so
governor
holden
however
seemed
not
to
be
satisfied
with
the
shoffner
bill
for
on
the
of
march
he
to
the
president
asking
that
stringent
orders
be
sent
to
the
commanding
general
and
stating
that
if
criminals
could
be
arrested
and
tried
before
military
tribunals
and
shot
there
would
soon
be
peace
and
order
throughout
the
country
the
remedy
he
said
would
be
a
sharp
and
bloody
one
but
indispensable
as
was
the
suppression
of
the
rebellion
the
he
wrote
to
the
members
of
congress
from
north
beseeching
them
to
induce
congress
to
author
the
president
to
declare
martial
law
in
certain
localities
so
that
he
might
have
military
tribunals
by
which
assassins
and
murderers
can
be
summarily
tried
and
shot
and
telling
them
at
the
same
time
that
he
could
not
have
such
tribunals
unless
the
president
was
authorized
to
suspend
the
habeas
corpus

full

that
the

john

then
a
senator
from
caswell
county
was
secretly
murdered
in
an
unused
room
in
the
courthouse
at
yanceyville
a
large
concourse
filled
the
house
when
the
deed
was
committed
the
occasion
being
a
democratic
political
gathering
and
stephens
was
seen
and
talked
to
at
the
meeting
being
there
as
a
spectator
strange
to
say
however
it
is
a
mystery
to
this
day
as
to
who
committed
the
crime
it
was
insisted
by
governor
holden
and
his
party
that
stephens
had
been
murdered
by
the
this
however
was
as
stoutly
denied
and
the
assertion
added
that
as
stephens
was
an
object
of
derision
and
contempt
rather
than
of
hatred
there
was
neither
desire
nor
cause
to
put
him
to
death
meanwhile
congress
had
refused

confer
upon
the

the

to

and
the

kept
drawing
near
a
new
and
a
new

and
new
congressmen
were
to
be
elected
the
governor
and
his
party
were
therefore
compelled
to
rely
on
the
shoffner
bill
alone
state

they

in

the
original
of

appealed
to
his

to

him
saying
that
the

inhumanly
butchered
for
opinion
sake
cried

for

the

meanwhile
however
a
company
of
federal
troops
had
been
stationed
at
yanceyville
and
had
found
use
for
neither
ball
nor
bayonet
and
in

caswell
were
arrested
and
imprisoned
by
kirke
and
his
subordinates
in
some
instances
persons
thus
seized
were
hung
up
by
the
neck
or
otherwise
treated
with
great
brutality
among
there
prisoners
were
many
men
who
had
been
for
years
of
the
first
respectability
as
citizens
and
were
known
and
honored
in
every
portion
of
the
state
application
was
speedily
made
to
pearson
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
that
adolphus
moore
and
others
thus
imprisoned
might
know
the
cause
of
their
detention
and
receive
the
protection
of
the
laws
judge
pearson
granted
the
writ
but
when
it
was
served
on
kirke
he
directed
the
messenger
to
inform
the
that
such
things
had
played
out
that
he
was
acting
in
accordance
with
governor
holden
orders
and
he
refused
to
obey
the
command
of
his
honor
the
lawyers
of
the
imprisoned
men
then
asked
for
further
process
of
the
judge
to
punish
kirke
for
his
disregard
of
his
orders
but
judge
pearson
passed
over
his
contemptuous
message
as
the
flippant
speech
of
a
rude
soldier
and
held
that
his
powers
were
exhausted
as
the
governor
had
ordered
kirke
to
seize
the
men
and
the
judiciary
could
not
contend
with
the
executive
and
in
this
he
was
sustained
by
the
other
members
of
the
court
the
conspiracy
against
the
constitution
the
laws
and
the
liberties
of
the
people
developed
rapidly
now
that
the
highest
judges
in
the
state
had
declared
the
courts
of
the
state
to
be
impotent
the
military
tribunals
that
the
governor
failed
to
get
from
congress
in
march
he
now
proceeded
to
organize
under
the
shoffner
act
the
court
was
to
consist
of
thirteen
members
seven
of
whom
governor
holden
selected
from
among
his
own
partisans
in
the
militia
and
six
he
left
to
kirke
to
select
from
the
officers
of
his
command
the
day
of
july
was
first
selected
for
the
meeting
of
the
court
and
then
the
of
august
it
was
a
terrible
state
of
affairs
the
chief
executive
of
the
state
was
daily
making
his
preparations
for
holding
a
drum
head
to
try
the
best
men
in
all
the
land
tie
them
to
stakes
and
shoot
them
like
dogs
while
the
judiciary
standing
in
sight
and
in
hearing
declared
itself
helpless

fortunately
pearson
and
those
who
sat
with
him
were
not
the
only
judges
in
north
carolina
there
proved
to
be
at
least
one
judge
who
did
not
think
his
powers
exhausted
that
judge
was
george
brooks
judge
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
north
carolina
and
application
was
accordingly
made
to
him
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
he
came
to
raleigh
and
was
told
by
the
governor
that
if
he
interfered
civil
war
would
ensue
but
judge
brooks
was
inflexible
and
on
august
he
ordered
marshal
carrow
to
notify
colonel
kirke
that
in
ten
days
his
prisoners
should
be
brought
before
his
honor
at
salisbury
governor
holden
then
appealed
to
president
grant
informing
him
of
the
situation
and
the
president
after
advising
with
the
replied
that
the
authority
of
judge
brooks
must
be
respected
kirke
accordingly
brought
a
portion
of
his
prisoners
as
ordered
to
salisbury
and
as
no
crimes
were
alleged
for
their
detention
they
were
all
set
at
liberty
as
soon
as
governor
holden
was
informed
of
the
decision
of
the
president
he
sent
a
messenger
in
haste
to
the
chief
justice
who
thereupon
came
to
raleigh
and
the
prisoners
who
had
not
been
brought
before
judge
brooks
at
salisbury
were
carried
before
him
and
the
other
judges
of
the
supreme
court
at
raleigh
but
it
was
judge
brooks
who
broke
the
backbone
of
this
great
conspiracy
against
the
government
of
north
carolina
no
man
ever
lived
on
our
soil
who
deserved
to
be
held
in
more
grateful
remembrance
by
the
people
of
north
carolina
than
he
whatever
others
may
have
done
in
building
up
the
state
it
was
he
that
saved
her
constitution
and
her
laws
and
the
liberties
of
her
people
the
scenes
of
horror
that
would
have
been
witnessed
but
for
his
timely
interference
can
not
be
thought
of
even
now
without
a
shudder
it
is
greatly
to
be
hoped
that
the
legislature
will
speedily
erect
a
suitable
monument
in
the
capitol
square
in
token
of
the
gratitude
of
the
people
for
whom
he
did

chapter
lxviii
the
impeachment
of
governor
holden
to
the
election
of
resulted
in
a
great
triumph
for
the
people
opponents
of
the
administration
were
elected
to
the
legislature
in
overwhelming
majorities
and
a
determination
to
bring
governor
holden
to
trial
for
his
crimes
against
the
constitution
and
liberties
of
the
people
was
at
once
apparent
nothing
can
be
more
important
in
a
civilized
government
than
protection
to
the
liberties
of
the
people
nothing
is
truer
than
that
eternal
vigilance
is
the
price
of
liberty
even
in
the
royal
government
of
england
for
more
than
two
centuries
the
king
has
had
no
power
to
deprive
a
citizen
of
the
right
to
be
heard
in
the
courts
when
restrained
by
legal
process
or
otherwise
neither
there
nor
in
america
could
anything
but
foreign
invasion
or
positive
insurrection
justify
even
parliament
or
congress
in
suspending
the
right
to
this
palladium
of
civil
liberty
upon
motion
in
the
house
of
representatives
the
legislature
having
assembled
a
committee
was
appointed
to
inquire
into
the
facts
and
soon
articles
of
impeachment
were
presented
to
the
senate
charging
the
governor
of
the
state
with
the
commission
of
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
by
the
terms
of
the
state
constitution
this
worked
a
disability
in
governor
holden
and
tod
caldwell
of
burke
then
assumed
control
of
the
executive
department
in
a
court
of
impeachment
in
north
carolina
when
the
governor
is
on
trial
the
is
the
president
of
the
body
the
members
of
the
senate
are
triers
and
the
house
of
representatives
act
as
prosecutors
in
behalf
of
the
people
and
a
vote
is
required
to
convict
thus
with
judge
pearson
presiding
there
was
a
long
and
deliberate
examination
as
to
the
charges
made
against
the
magistrate
of
north
carolina
after
hearing
the
testimony
presented
both
by
the
accusers
and
by
the
respondent
governor
holden
was
convicted
of
the
charges
made
against
him
deprived
of
his
office
and
declared
incapable
of
holding
any
further
honor
or
dignity
in
the
state
such
a
trial
has
been
seen
but
in
this
single
instance
in
all
the
history
of
the
state
and
it
attracted
considerable
attention
in
its
progress
it
involved
great
and
important
issues
and
was
happily
followed
by
peace
and
quiet
in
every
portion
of
the
state
after
eight
years
absence
a
delegation
was
again
seen
in
the
federal
capital
representing
the
state
of
north
carolina
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
for
two
years
past
her
members
of
congress
had
been
allowed
to
participate
in
the
national
legislation
and
thus
an
ignominious
disability
had
at
last
been
removed
from
her
federal
relations
a
mighty
convulsion
that
had
stirred
the
nation
to
its
depths
was
being
slowly
hushed
into
calm
by
the
adoption
of
wiser
and
more
peaceful
methods
a
broader
nationality
was
coming
alike
to
the
northern
and
southern
people
and
the
wounds
of
the
war
were
fast
healing
in
the
lapse
of
time
the
census
of
showed
vast
improvement
in
many
departments
of
human
industry
north
carolina
in
the
many
alterations
wrought
by
the
war
was
learning
the
wisdom
of
diversifying
the
pursuits
of
the
people
slowly
public
attention
was
being
turned
to
the
opening
of
new
industries
the
western
north
carolina
the
raleigh
augusta
and
the
carolina
central
railroads
were
opening
up
a
new
era
in
the
history
of
such
interests
in
the
old
north
state
with
a
greatly
extended
area
of
production
in
cotton
there
was
besides
an
enormous
addition
of
railroad
profits
from
the
increase
both
of
travel
and
freights
as
the
railway
lines
lengthened
to
the
west
it
was
found
that
they
would
repay
the
cost
of
construction
and
each
of
the
rival
political
parties
pledged
itself
to
the
completion
of
the
great
western
road
which
was
to
pierce
the
extreme
mountain
barriers
and
find
outlets
into
tennessee
both
at
ducktown
and
the
warm
springs
in
madison
county
slowly
this
great
dream
of
the
wise
men
of
the
past
approaches
the
day
of
its
accomplishment
a
half
century
has
gone
by
since
joseph
caldwell
and
governor
dudley
first
impressed
this
scheme
upon
the
public
mind
as
a
work
of
the
future
questions

about
protection
of

what
was

by

how
did
these

affect
the

who
assumed

trace

what
is

the
accomplishment
of
these
improvements
how
long
has
it
been
since
this
scheme
was
impressed
upon
the
public
chapter
lxix
resumption
of
in
the
years
that
had
passed
since
the
close
of
the
war
between
the
states
the
people
of
north
carolina
had
been
continually
looking
forward
to
the
hour
when
the
state
should
be
fully
restored
to
its
old
relations
with
the
federal
government
in
the
consummation
of
the
reconstruction
policy
inaugurated
and
carried
out
by
congress
this
had
been
partially
attained
but
in
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
adopted
in
there
were
many
particulars
that
were
unsuited
to
the
habits
of
the
people
and
amendment
was
eagerly
desired
in
this
respect
political
animosities
were
being
softened
by
the
lapse
of
time
and
general
prosperity
was
fast
extending
to
different
sections
towns
and
villages
were
being
built
along
the
lines
of
railroads
and
cotton
and
other
factories
were
constantly
being
added
just
previous
to
the
outbreak
of
the
late
war
the
masonic
grand
lodge
of
north
carolina
had
reared
at
oxford
a
large
and
costly
building
which
was
called
john
college
and
was
intended
for
the
education
of
young
men
in
this
building
was
devoted
by
the
fraternity
that
had
erected
it
to
the
education
of
the
orphan
children
of
north
carolina
this
noble
charity
was
placed
in
the
care
of
john
mills
who
has
abundantly
justified
the
wisdom
of
those
who
were
parties
to
his
being
chosen
for
so
responsible
a
place
this
school
which
educates
so
many
who
would
otherwise
grow
up
in
ignorance
and
vice
is
aided
now
by
an
annual
appropriation
from
the
state
and
another
from
the
grand
lodge
of
masons
but
on
individual
contributions
of
the
charitable
it
is
mainly
dependent
for
its
support
perhaps
no
other
charity
ever
so
much
enlisted
popular
sympathy
in
north
carolina
and
none
ever
more
richly
repaid
the
unselfish
contributions
of
the
people
at
the
period
now
reached
the
university
had
ceased
to
be
attended
as
a
college
rev
solomon
pool
still
remained
its
president
but
the
buildings
were
silent
and
the
famous
seat
of
learning
no
longer
held
its
proud
position
among
american
institutions
meanwhile
the
denominational
colleges
were
vigorously
at
work
and
were
receiving
a
larger
patronage
than
formerly
among
the
female
seminaries
of
the
state
a
new
and
formidable
rival
for
popular
favor
arose
peace
institute
at
raleigh
this
institution
like
the
orphan
asylum
had
originated
before
the
war
but
during
the
years
of
strife
the
building
was
used
as
a
hospital
it
is
controlled
by
the
presbyterians
and
under
their
excellent
management
it
has
become
one
of
the
best
appointed
and
most
popular
institutions
in
all
the
state
in
the
nomination
and
of
general
grant
as
president
of
the
united
states
in
there
were
many
incidents
to
show
the
alteration
in
southern
sentiment
the
white
men
of
the
south
as
a
general
thing
voted
in
that
contest
for
horace
greeley
of
new
york
he
had
been
long
identified
with
all
the
movements
that
were
specially
obnoxious
to
southern
people
and
yet
after
so
many
bitter
differences
in
the
fifty
years
past
the
old
leader
of
the
abolitionists
became
the
nominee
of
the
democrats
and
received
their
votes
for
the
presidency
this
strange
course
was
said
by
those
who
pursued
it
to
be
dictated
by
the
desire
on
their
parts
to
show
that
they
did
not
harbor
resentment
toward
old
enemies
and
were
not
now
disaffected
toward
the
union
but
were
willing
for
the
dead
past
to
bury
its
dead
and
well
might
they
pursue
such
a
course
with
the
close
of
the
war
had
passed
all
reason
for
the
existence
of
another
republic
in
the
abolition
of
slavery
the
states
had
become
uniform
in
interest
and
it
was
soon
patent
that
it
ought
to
need
only
a
little
time
to
heal
the
breaches
of
the
war
and
restore
concord
to
the
two
great
sections
of
the
mighty
american
commonwealth
unfortunately
however
the
men
who
swayed
the
destinies
of
the
country
were
more
partisans
than
patriots
and
sought
to
perpetuate
the
domination
of
their
party
more
than
the
restoration
of
peace
and
concord
in
the
sober
second
thought
of
the
american
people
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
patriotism
will
prevail
that
hatred
and
malevolence
can
continue
indefinitely
in
the
relations
of
the
two
grand
divisions
of
the
republic
is
as
impossible
as
it
would
be
unwise
and
wicked
their
destiny
is
too
grand
for
the
people
of
america
to
think
of
marring
it
by
a
continuance
of
strife
year
by
year
the

common
in
north
carolina
this
was
even
more
the
case
than
is
now
the
preparation
of
woolen
fabrics
upon
the
handlooms
of
the
families
so
soon
as
the
lint
cotton
was
cheaply
separated
from
its
seed
the
great
question
of
its
universal
use
was
solved
it
could
be
so
easily
produced
that
no
woolen
or
linen
fabrics
could
hope
to
compete
with
it
in
the
markets
of
the
world
the
good
women
of
the
state
soon
learned
the
economy
of
buying
the
cotton
warp
of
the
cloth
wove
at
the
farmhouses
but
it
was
long
before
even
this
common
domestic
necessity
was
prepared
for
use
in
the
south
the
cotton
yarns
were
until
about
almost
all
spun
in
new
england
and
bought
by
the
merchants
in
the
large
cities
when
laying
in
their
supplies
of
goods
for
the
retail
trade
the
purchase
of
slaves
and
the
cultivation
of
cotton
so
completely
absorbed
the
energies
of
our
people
that
no
one
invested
capital
in
anything
else
except
perhaps
some
who
preferred
real
estate
for
such
a
purpose
but
even
before
the
civil
war
and
the
liberation
of
the
slaves
there
were
wise
men
who
urged
the
propriety
and
profit
of
cotton
mills
in
the
south
since
the
war
there
has
been
an
immense
development
of
this
industry
and
now
the
sound
of
the
loom
and
spindle
may
be
beard
throughout
the
state
hundreds
of
persons
are
employed
in
a
single
one
of
the
cotton
mills
in
this
way
not
only
the
wealth
but
the
population
of
the
section
is
increased
by
bringing
in
new
settlers
the
railways
find
added
employment
and
in
some
cases
private
residences
are
seen
that
are
rural
paradises
in
the
beauty
and
comfort
of
their
appointments
there
is
in
some
of
the
western
counties
large
capital
invested
in
mills
for
the
manufacture
of
woolen
yarns
and
cloth
from
which
satisfactory
profits
are
realized
another
one
of
the
important
industries
of
the
state
is
the
manufacture
of
paper
the
daily
and
weekly
newspapers
of
north
carolina
are
now
largely
supplied
with
printing
papers
by
the
mills
of
the
state
the
first
paper
mill
in
north
carolina
was
erected
near
hillsboro
in
the
second
one
was
built
at
salem
in
by
gotleib
shober
north
carolina
has
ever
been
slow
to
change
in
the
habits
of
her
people
the
ways
of
their
forefathers
always
seem
best
to
most
of
them
until
abundant
example
has
shown
the
wisdom
of
an
innovation
steam
however
is
usurping
a
place
in
every
species
of
labor
and
motion
the
great
seines
of
albemarle
sound
the
printing
press
the
cotton
gin
and
nearly
everything
else
is
now
obedient
to
the
tireless
energies
of
this
great
motor
when
north
carolina
shall
have
developed
her
system
of
transportation
so
that
the
coal
and
iron
mines
shall
be
more
largely
worked
and
when
as
now
in
vermont
not
only
cotton
but
woolen
factories
shall
be
found
in
every
section
where
such
staples
are
produced
then
and
not
until
then
will
the
civilization
of
the
state
be
complete
they
who
merely
produce
raw
material
will
ever
be
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
to
others
who
prepare
such
things
for
market
second
alone
in
importance
to
the
state
at
large
after
the
cotton
factories
are
those
devoted
to
the
handling
and
preparation
of
tobacco
for
the
market
the
western
powers
of
europe
had
for
many
years
realized
immense
revenues
by
means
of
their
imports
and
monopolies
of
the
virginia
weed
before
the
government
of
the
united
states
ever
realized
a
dollar
from
all
the
vast
production
of
this
crop
in
the
different
states
so
too
in
north
carolina
enterprise
and
capital
had
remained
almost
completely
blind
to
the
possibilities
of
the
situation
though
great
quantities
of
tobacco
had
been
grown
in
many
of
the
counties
and
the
soil
and
climate
were
suited
to
the
production
of
the
finest
and
costliest
grades
yet
the
farmers
were
content
to
raise
such
as
commanded
but
humble
prices
and
but
a
small
proportion
of
this
was
prepared
for
use
in
the
vicinity
of
its
production
in
a
few
villages
and
on
some
of
the
farms
were
to
be
found
small
factories
which
with
the
rudest
appliances
converted
into
plugs
of
chewing
tobacco
such
portions
of
the
crop
of
the
neighborhood
as
could
be
probably
sold
from
itinerant
wagons
these
vehicles
were
sent
to
the
eastern
counties
and
even
to
portions
of
south
carolina
and
georgia
to
supply
the
farms
and
country
stores
this
traffic
continued
until
the
strong
arm
of
the
federal
government
by
means
of
internal
revenue
laws
was
interposed
between
the
peddlers
and
their
ancient
profits
the
bulk
of
the
crop
was
sent
before
this
to
be
manufactured
at
richmond
lynchburg
and
danville
in
virginia
the
fine
brands
of
plug
and
all
smoking
tobacco
used
in
north
carolina
were
received
from
these
cities
if
he
who
adds
to
the
number
of
grass
blades
is
a
public
benefactor
then
the
creators
of
new
industries
and

may
well
claim
consideration
along
with
the

in

in

state
of

as
to
her
material
interests
north
carolina
again
became
excited
in
over
the
choice
of
new
men
for
both
of
the
republic
and
of
the
state
after
eight
years
of
service
as
president
of
the

general
grant
was
retired
to
private
life
and
governor
brogden
who
had
succeeded
governor
caldwell
upon
the
death
of
the
latter
in
was
also
near
the
end
of
his
service
as
governor
of
north
carolina
no
gubernatorial
election
was
ever
more
exciting
to
the
state
it
resulted
in
the
choice
of
governor
z
vance
over
judge
thomas
settle
of
the
supreme
court
in
the
complications
which
resulted
in
the
seating
of
governor
hayes
as
president
of
the
united
states
there
was
such
a
change
effected
that
the
federal
army
was
no
longer
employed
to
uphold
the
reconstructed
officials
in
louisiana
and
south
carolina
and
the
people
of
those
states
at
last
were
left
to
the
management
of
their
own
affairs
with
this
consummation
so
long
and
devoutly
wished
came
that
peace
and
contentment
to
all
sections
which
had
been
unknown
since
the
enormous
increase
in
the
amount
and
quality
of
cotton
grown
in
north
carolina
since
the
late
war
has
been
dependent
upon
the
use
of
various
fertilizers
and
other
appliances
of
a
better
cultivation
of
the
soil
the
old
habit
of
educated
men
in
committing
their
plantations
and
slaves
to
the
management
of
overseers
has
been
almost
wholly
abandoned
many
individuals
of
the
largest
culture
are
now
devoting
their
time
and
skill
to
the
discovery
of
improved
methods
in
agriculture
and
north
carolina
is
reaping
a
golden
harvest
thereby
no
employment
except
agriculture
exceeds
in
importance
that
of
the
merchant
north
carolina
is
shut
off
from
foreign
commerce
by
the
sand
barriers
on
the
coast
only
at
beaufort
on
old
topsail
inlet
can
be
found
such
an
entrance
to
internal
waters
as
promises
safety
to
the
mariner
who
would
approach
with
his
vessel
but
while
this
has
precluded
the
possibility
of
great
commercial
activity
in
north
carolina
there
has
not
been
a
lack
of
men
at
any
period
of
our
history
to
illustrate
the
dignity
and
importance
of
legitimate
traffic
cornelius
harnett
and
joseph
hewes
were
as
conspicuous
for
financial
success
as
they
were
for
patriotism
during
the
revolution
with
the
return
of
peace
to
the
belligerent
states
north
carolina
was
commercially
prostrate
the
merchants
and
the
banks
were
almost
all
ruined
in
the
general
impoverishment
of
their
debtors
the
supply
of
cotton
which
remained
on
hand
at
the
cessation
of
hostilities
was
about
all
that
had
been
left
in
the
general
wreck
upon
which
trade
could
be
again
commenced
with
parties
at
a
distance
raleigh
had
never
been
recognized
as
a
trade
centre
a
few
stores
on
fayetteville
street
between
the
state
house
and
where
the
federal
building
now
stands
were
the
representatives
of
their
class
in
the
city
cotton
was
very
little
grown
in
that
region
of
the
state
and
no
market
for
its
sale
had
even
existed
nearer
than
norfolk
and
petersburg
but
this
state
of
things
was
not
to
continue
numbers
of
young
men
combining
great
energy
and
judgment
with
small
capital
came
to
the
city
and
began
the
work
of
expanding
its
trade
and
resources
it
has
not
like
durham
risen
up
in
a
few
years
from
almost
nothing
but
so
great
a
change
has
been
wrought
that
the
story
of
its
growth
is
one
of
the
most
striking
incidents
in
the
state
history
the
extension
of
the
railway
lines
has
opened
up
new
custom
in
many
counties
that
had
never
previously
dealt
with
merchants
of
the
place
the
development
of
commerce
and
manufacture
is
the
great
hope
of
the
old
north
state
the
enterprise
and
capital
of
this
and
other
communities
are
seeking
opportunities
of
investment
and
the
day
is
fast
coming
when
north
carolina
will
rival
pennsylvania
in
the
variety
and
excellence
of
her
manufactures
the
cotton
exchange
of
raleigh
is
aiding
very
largely
in
building
up
the
business
of
the
city
to
vast
proportions
the
quantity
of
cotton
sold
in
raleigh
has
been
rapidly
increasing
annually
since
the
war
and
the
receipts
for
the
year
amounted
to
over
thousand
bales
in
the
entire
product
of
the
state
was
only
one
hundred
and
thousand
bales
in
the
towns
and
cities
of
north
carolina
may
be
found
a
considerable
number
of
israelites
engaged
in
the
various
branches
of
trade
and
this
class
of
our
citizens
has
added
no
little
to
the
general
growth
and
material
prosperity
of
the
state
they
have
synagogues
at
wilmington
charlotte
raleigh
goldsboro
and
new
bern
about
the
year
the
example
of
the
federal
government
and
that
of
certain
northern
states
induced
the
state
commissioner
of
agriculture
to
establish
a
fish
hatchery
at
a
mouth
of
salmon
creek
in
bertie
county
this
establishment
has
hatched
and
liberated
a
very
large
number
of
shad
and
other
varieties
of
fish
and
valuable
returns
are
seen
in
some
of
the
rivers
that
have
been
in
this
manner
replenished
with
this
savory
and
abundant
source
of
food
it
has
been
satisfactorily
demonstrated
by
seth
green
of
new
york
and
other
naturalists
that
fish
which
are
spawned
in
fresh
water
and
reared
at
sea
almost
invariably
seek
the
place
of
their
birth
in
the
spring
when
they
reach
maturity
in
addition
to
this
artificial
increase
of
the
supply
of
fish
there
have
been
large
additions
made
to
the
means
of
their
capture
the
use
of
steam
in
the
handling
of
the
long
seines
and
the
great
weirs
known
as
dutch
nets
have
opened
the
way
to
an
indefinite
increase
of
the
amount
taken
while
the
use
of
ice
and
rapid
transportation
make
it
possible
to
deliver
the
fish
fresh
in
the
markets
of
the
northern
and
western
cities
this
trade
is
also
supplemented
in
the
same
region
by
such
attention
to
the
growth
and
sale
of
vegetables
all
the
requirements
as
to
position
soil
and
climate
are
abundantly
filled
by
the
counties
with
alluvial
soils
along
the
seacoast
heavy
crops
of
irish
potatoes
and
garden
peas
are
reared
on
the
same
land
which
later
in
the
year
supplies
a
second
crop
of
cotton
and
corn
in
the
same
eastern
counties
the
products
of
the
farms
have
been
increased
by
a
large
and
rapidly
extending
area
devoted
to
the
production
of
peanuts
and
highland
rice
with
the
exception
of
a
limited
supply
of
the
former
article
grown
above
wilmington
there
was
seen
in
other
communities
only
a
few
small
patches
for
the
use
of
the
family
but
with
no
design
of
sale
or
shipment
in
many
eastern
counties
the
fields
of
peanuts
are
of
late
year
almost
as
numerous
as
those
of
cotton
the
same
history
belongs
to
the
highland
rice
this
great
staple
of
human
diet
is
rapidly
becoming
a
favorite
crop
and
mills
for
its
preparation
are
fast
making
their
appearance
in
different
localities
nowhere
else
in
the
state
has
there
been
so
great
an
increase
in
trade
as
in
the
city
of
wilmington
many
ships
from
foreign
ports
began
to
visit
cape
fear
river
and
from
different
cities
in
other
states
regular
lines
of
steam
packets
were
established
which
greatly
facilitated
the
means
of
communication
repeated
appropriations
but
never
in
sufficient
amount
were
made
from
time
to
time
by
the
united
states
congress
for
the
improvement
of
cape
fear
and
other
watercourses
in
north
carolina
the
closing
of
new
inlet
is
believed
to
be
entirely
efficacious
in
the
effort
to
deepen
the
approach
by
way
of
the
river
mouth
a
stone
barrier
of
great
length
and
stability
shuts
off
the
flow
of
water
except
past
fort
caswell
and
the
happiest
results
are
already
realized
in
the
city
of
new
bern
another
shipping
point
of
importance
had
been
largely
developed
in
the
years
since
the
close
of
the
war
there
too
is
the
terminus
of
prosperous
freight
lines
employing
many
large
steam
vessels
that
yet
ply
regularly
between
neuse
river
and
cities
beyond
the
borders
of
the
state
a
great
trade
in
lumber
and
garden
produce
is
improved
by
cotton
and
other
factories
that
add
largely
to
the
population
and

the
railroads
and
new
towns
the
raleigh
gaston
railroad
originally
connected
the
two
places
that
gave
name
to
the
route
it
was
necessary
in
reaching
raleigh
from
the
albemarle
region
to
go
to
weldon
and
then
by
the
petersburg
railroad
the
junction
in
greenville
county
virginia
gave
access
by
a
short
line
to
gaston
it
was
not
until
about
that
the
raleigh
gaston
route
was
extended
directly
down
the
roanoke
river
to
weldon
this
was
a
great
facility
to
both
trade
and
travel
on
this
important
line
yet
twenty
years
elapsed
in
the
progress
of
internal
communication
before
this
short
link
could
be
added
a
great
trunk
line
extending
east
and
west
through
the
whole
length
of
the
state
has
long
been
a
favorite
scheme
of
many
statesmen
in
the
effort
to
build
up
a
seaport
at
beaufort
but
in
the
progress
of
the
late
war
it
became
to
the
confederate
government
to
tap
the
north
carolina
road
at
greensboro
in
order
that
troops
and
military
freights
might
be
speedily
conveyed
to

and
the
western
north
carolina
road
from
salisbury
to
asheville
and
the

rock
branch
have
enormously
increased
the
facilities
for

have
also
been
recently
added
to
the
railway
system
the
road
from
winston
to
greensboro
has
resulted
in
the
creation
of
a
city
alongside
of
ancient
salem
which
is
in
every
respect
the
compeer
of
durham
in
the
swiftness
of
its
growth
and
the
amount
of
its
trade
and
manufactures
winston
durham
and
reidsville
have
arisen
almost
like
magic
and
are
expanding
into
such
importance
that
charlotte
salisbury
and
greensboro
have
all
felt
the
consequences
of
their
growth
in
trade
and
population
the
city
of
charlotte
has
greatly
prospered
and
has
become
important
for
its
large
trade
and
railway
interests
perhaps
nowhere
else
in
the
state
have
the
citizens
of
a
city
shown
greater
enterprise
its
merchants
lawyers
and
editors
have
all
won
the
respect
and
admiration
of
other
communities
and
have
raised
their
city
to
such
prosperity
that
it
is
now
rapidly
becoming
a
rival
of
wilmington
and
raleigh
and
taking
place
in
the
front
rank
among
north
carolina
emporiums
one
of
the
most
remarkable
scenes
ever
witnessed
in
north
carolina
was
the
famous
centennial
anniversary
of
the
signing
of
the
mecklenburg
declaration
it
filled
charlotte
with
thousands
of
visitors
among
whom
were
the
governors
of
several
states
and
many
other
distinguished
american
citizens
graham
judge
john
kerr
governor
brogden
and
others
delivered
orations
and
the
of
the
state
were
gathered
to
do
honor
to
an
event
that
had
made
charlotte
forever
sacred
to
history
and
song
this
occurrence
was
of
course
on
may
and
just
one
hundred
years
later
than
the
concourse
ordered
by
colonel
thomas
polk
fayetteville
asheville
and
statesville
have
also
afforded
remarkable
instances
of
thrift
and
expansion
in
the
busy
latter
years
of
our
state
history
now
besides
being
a
favorite
resort
as
a
watering
place
supplements
its
summer
festivities
with
large
numbers
of
visitors
avoiding
the
rigors
of
winter
months
elsewhere
it
is
becoming
a
railway
centre
and
is
fast
developing
a
large
and
lucrative
trade
the
tendency
toward
the
erection
of
manufactories
and
the
recent
influx
of
foreign
immigrants
are
happy
auguries
for
the
continued
prosperity
and
growth
of
towns
in
the
state
the
wondrous
diversity
of
products
of
the
soil
the
extent
of
the
forests
and
the
richness
of
the
mines
all
combine
to
demonstrate
the
ease
with
which
the
success
of
other
american
states
can
be
rivalled
in
our
own
already
the
mountains
have
been
pierced
by
the
railway
from
salisbury
other
lines
from
virginia
south
carolina
and
tennessee
are
being
constructed
so
that
every
portion
even
of
the
mountainous
region
will
soon
be
within
easy
reach
of
the
markets
of
the
world
the
cranberry
iron
ores
the
matchless
mica
quarries
and
the
corundum
deposits
are
all
being
made
available
to
commerce
and
will
realize
valuable
returns
for
the
capital
employed
upon
them
not
the
least
remarkable
among
the
new
industries
of
the
western
counties
is
the
collection
and
shipment
of
ginseng
and
other
valuable
medicinal
roots
and
herbs
a
firm
in
statesville
have
been
for
years
past
employing
large
capital
in
this
business
which
seems
capable
of
indefinite
extension
the
preparation
of
dried
fruits
is
another
lucrative
addition
to
the
resources
of
the
same
region
years
ago
attention
was
called
to
the
fact
that
at
certain
elevations
in
the
mountains
there
was
no
frost
to
be
seen
at
any
period
of
the
year
and
this
immunity
has
been
turned
to
valuable
account
by
the
fruit
growers
and
now
great
orchards
are
found
in
many
parts
of
the
westerns
counties
and
shipments
of
very
fine
apples
show
the
cultivation
given
to
them
north
carolina
is
not
only
the
original
habitation
of
the
scuppernong
grape
but
also
of
the
luscious
catawba
this
latter
fine
fruit
which
has
proven
so
valuable
to
the
nurseries
of
cincinnati

in
this
latitude
yadkin
county
was
before
famous
for
the
production
of
a
stronger
beverage
derived
from
rye
and
corn
since
the
war
many
distilleries
have
been
carried
on
in
the
state
in
spite
of
the
government
regulations
that
carry
so
many
men
as
culprits
to
the
federal
prisons
the
offenders
known
as
moonshiners
are
those
who
make
and
sell
whisky
without
paying
the
united
states
for
a
license
in
the
trade
these
transgressors
of
the
law
have
for
years
been
hunted
like
italian
bandits
or
ferocious
wild
beasts
and
not
unfrequently
blood
has
been
shed
in
defence
of
the
hidden
distilleries
and
quite
as
often
in
attacking
them
and
their
owners
in
february
of
this
year
the
secretary
of
state
joseph
engelhard
died
after
a
brief
illness
in
the
death
of
major
engelhard
the
state
sustained
a
great
loss
as
a
soldier
he
was
faithful
capable
and
brave
at
once
made
a
conspicuous
leader
in
the
fierce
struggles
that
followed
the
war
by
his
control
of
a
prominent
journal
he
proved
ever
courageous
and
of
rare
judgment
and
to
him
for
the
happy
termination
of
those
terrible
struggles
the
state
owes
a
deep
debt
of
gratitude
that
now
unhappily
she
can
repay
only
in
honorable
remembrance

literature
and
authors
it
would
seem
natural
that
the
connection
of
sir
walter
raleigh
with
the
history
of
north
carolina
should
have
added
to
the
literary
tendencies
of
a
people
blessed
with
such
a
godfather
he
was
so
full
of
genius
and
devotion
to
letters
that
a
special
impetus
ought
thereby
to
have
been
given
to
the
cultivation
of
a
similar
spirit
among
those
who
were
to
inhabit
the
land
of
his
love
but
though
hariot
lawson
and
quaint
brickell
were
moved
by
such
a
spirit
the
muses
have
not
made
the
old
north
state
very
remarkable
in
this
respect
north
carolina
has
always
been
since
its
settlement
the
home
of
some
highly
cultivated
people
but
all
the
while
the
mass
of
the
population
has
possessed
but
little
knowledge
of
books
this
fact
has
been
a
great
discouragement
to
the
production
of
authors
professions
are
not
eagerly
sought
when
not
encouraged
by
the
sympathy
and
support
of
the
public
in
the
period
just
preceding
the
revolt
from
british
rule
edward
moseley
and
samuel
swann
had
been
succeeded
by
men
who
possessed
better
literary
opportunities
and
were
more
devoted
to
general
culture
than
had
been
these
two
able
and
accomplished
lawyers
moseley
with
every
requirement
could
never
bring
to
any
of
his
many
controversies
with
governor
pollok
and
others
such
flowers
of
rhetoric
as
judge
maurice
moore
lavished
upon
his
famous
atticus
letter
that
production
was
just
such
an
attack
upon
governor
tryon
for
his
conduct
toward
the
regulators
as
a
few
years
later
immortalized
the
english
writer
who
is
to
this
day
only
known
by
his
signature
junius
when
judge
moore
and
his
compeer
cornelius
harnett
were
growing
old
william
hooper
archibald
maclaine
and
the
first
james
iredell
were
young
lawyers
who
travelled
to
all
the
superior
courts
in
the
state
and
mingled
largely
with
their
inspections
of
coke
and
the
new
lectures
of
blackstone
no
man
or
woman
then
in
north
carolina
wrote
books
as
a
profession
but
the
copious
correspondence
of
that
day
which
yet
survives
and
upon
which
fifty
cents
were
paid
as
postage
for
each
letter
proves
that
what
was
called
polite
literature
engaged
much
of
their
attention
they
made
fine
speeches
and
judge
iredell
wrote
a
law
book
and
frequent
dissertation
for
the
newspapers
but
beyond
this
and
an
occasional
pamphlet
no
literary
tasks
were
undertaken
hugh
williamson
was
a
man
of
similar
habits
he
was
not
only
a
skillful
physician
but
served
with
credit
as
a
college
professor
and
a
member
of
the
convention
at
philadelphia
which
formed
the
federal
constitution
and
he
was
also
a
member
of
the
united
states
congress
after
ceasing
to
be
a
citizen
of
this
state
he
undertook
to
write
its
history
but
achieved
very
moderate
success
as
an
author
in
the
lapse
of
years
this
task
was
again
undertaken
by
judge
francois
xavier
martin
he
came
from
france
when
a
boy
and
practiced
law
for
seventeen
years
at
new
bern
his
compilation
of
the
statutes
and
history
of
north
carolina
were
invaluable
labors
and
will
ever
render
him
memorable
in
our
annals
his
dry
statement
of
facts
was
generally
correct
and
he
fell
into
very
few
errors
considering
that
he
was
the
first
to
attempt
anything
like
a
full
record
of
the
state
history
and
this
was
accomplished
in
his
new
home
in
louisiana
joseph
seawell
jones
was
a
remarkable
man
in
many
respects
he
was
brilliant
in
social
life
and
became
well
known
to
the
literary
and
fashionable
circles
of
new
york
and
washington
his
love
for
north
carolina
was
intense
and
the
defence
of
the
revolutionary
history
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
that
he
wrote
exhibits
both
talent
and
research
his
infirmities
of
temper
impaired
his
judgment
but
his
memory
should
ever
be
cherished
in
his
native
state
for
the
services
he
rendered
after
the
gay
scenes
of
his
early
manhood
he
spent
many
years
on
a
mississippi
plantation
his
last
book
was
entitled
my
log
cabin
in
the
prairie
early
in
the
present
century
the
literary
aspects
of
the
state
were
brightened
by
men
who
had
attended
as
students
on
joseph
caldwell
ministrations
at
chapel
hill
his
tendencies
were
all
so
practical
that
scientific
and
mechanical
development
was
more
encouraged
than
lighter
subjects
but
hardy
croom
joseph
hill
judge
murphey
and
rev
drs
william
hooper
and
francis
hawks
were
early
distinguished
for
the
elegance
of
their
literary
acquirements
judge
william
gaston
left
just
enough
literary
memorials
to
cause
us
to
regret
that
he
did
not
attempt
more
things
of
the
kind
his
ode
to
carolina
and
certain
orations
will
never
be
forgotten
judge
robert
strange
was
also
possessed
of
similar
gifts
philo
henderson
walker
anderson
and
abraham
morehead
were
largely
gifted
in
poetic
power
each
of
them
at
rare
intervals
indulged
in
compositions
that
show
what
might
have
been
accomplished
had
they
been
authors
by
profession
and
not
mere
literary
amateurs
the
state
while
possessing
a
number
of
excellent
musicians
has
not
produced
many
musical
compositions
of
special
merit
but
the
two
songs
the
old
north

by

william
gaston
and
ho
for

by

will
ever
remain

both
executed

of
the
former
are
of
the

possible

highly
prized
in
every
portion
of

rev
drs
hubbard

swain
have
each
been
large
contributors
to
the
same
cause
rev

and
the

added
much
to
the
fame
of

richard

great
credit
to
the
talented
authors
the
recent
history
of

county
by

is
both
pleasing
and
valuable
as
a
tribute
to
our
local
traditions
in
addition
to
the
authors
mentioned
there
have
been
members
of

have
produced
legal

very
great
importance
and
value
not
only
to
our
own
practitioners
but
also
to
lawyers
of
other

the
new
managers
had
installed
a
strange
faculty
in
the
seats
of
governor
swain
and
his
long
honored
coadjutors
but
since
the
restoration
of
the
ancient
order
of
things
prosperity
has
returned
both
to
the
university
and
the
beautiful
village
in
which
it
is
situated
many
useful
reforms
have
been
accomplished
in
its
curriculum
and
management
perhaps
never
before
was
seen
each
devotion
to
study
and
compliance
with
the
rules
on
the
part
of
the
students
the
president
kemp
battle
had
been
much
identified
with
the
institution
before
assuming
charge
of
its
fortunes
his
learning
combined
with
public
experience
made
him
a
wise
ruler
of
the
literary
community
over
which
he
was
called
to
preside
and
the
excellence
of
the
new
faculty
is
becoming
every
day
more
evident
in
the
scholarship
and
bearing
of
the
young
men
who
are
sent
out
from
its
halls
wake
forest
college
is
the
oldest
of
the
sectarian
colleges
of
the
state
and
has
long
vindicated
its
usefulness
among
the
baptist
churches
its
first
intended
end
was
the
education
of
young
men
for
the
ministry
but
this
has
been
largely
augmented
by
the
successes
of
its
graduates
in
every
other
branch
of
human
usefulness
in
our
midst
the
councils
of
the
state
and
the
learned
professions
have
been
greatly
illustrated
by
men
who
laid
the
foundations
of
their
success
by
diligent
application
to
their
duties
while
attending
as
students
at
wake
forest
in
the
recent
death
of
rev
wingate
the
institution
lost
a
president
who
had
given
long
and
signal
service
but
in
his
successor
rev
pritchard
perhaps
even
higher
executive
qualities
are
seen
wake
forest
catalogue
has
latterly
contained
about
two
hundred
names
of
students
and
through
the
munificence
of
certain
friends
the
college
has
received
handsome
additions
to
the
buildings
and
appliances
davidson
college
has
also
immensely
developed
in
the
last
few
years
not
only
in
increased
patronage
but
in
the
grade
of
scholarship
a
great
advance
has
been
achieved
so
that
few
institutions
in
america
afford
higher
and
more
thorough
instruction
than
is
now
enjoyed
by
the
young
men
who
avail
themselves
of
the
advantages
here
offered
the
same
things
may
be
said
of
trinity
college
under
the
direction
of
rev
craven
the
pulpits
of
the
methodist
churches
in
north
carolina
have
long
borne
evidence
of
the
literary
and
moral
excellence
imparted
to
the
graduates
and
in
many
respects
the
whole
state
has
been
benefited
and
elevated
by
contact
with
such
men
the
female
seminaries
at
salem
greensboro
raleigh
murfreesboro
thomasville
wilson
kittrell
oxford
and
louisburg
have
also
prospered
in
this
era
of
general
advancement
among
the
north
carolina
schools
large
numbers
of
young
ladies
from
other
states
are
sent
to
them
for
education
and
in
the
noble
emulation
thus
evolved
admirable
instruction
is
obtained
among
preparatory
schools
that
of
major
robert
bingham
at
mebaneville
in
alamance
county
is
by
common
consent
supreme
in
north
carolina
and
perhaps
in
the
south
not
only
in
number
of
students
but
in
the
excellence
of
tuition
discipline
and
drill
on
the
catalogue
of
this
institution
will
be
found
the
names
of
young
men
from
almost
every
state
in
the
union
and
even
some
foreign
countries
are
represented
other
similar
institutions
have
long
flourished
at
raleigh
oxford
greensboro
kinston
lagrange
oak
ridge
and
elsewhere
and
all
of
them
are
having
a
large
influence
for
good
upon
the
young
men
of
the
state
the
normal
schools
at
chapel
hill
and
other
towns
have
been
largely
attended
by
teachers
and
great
interest
is
also
manifested
in
the
graded
schools
at
no
previous
period
has
so
much
attention
been
bestowed
upon
matters
of
this
kind
by
the
people
of
north
carolina
one
of
the
most
prominent
of
the
graded
schools
in
the
state
was
organized
at
raleigh
in
through
the
efforts
of
capt
john
dugger
and
named
the
centennial
graded
school
the
great
success
of
this
institution
has
led
the
citizens
of
other
towns
in
the
state
to
establish
schools
of
like
character
there
are
now
to
be
found
flourishing
graded
schools
at
salisbury
fayetteville
goldsboro
wilson
greensboro
charlotte
wilmington
new
bern
rocky
mount
and
franklinton
several
towns
also
contain
excellent
schools
of
this
description
for
the
colored
people
and
their
effectiveness
is
rapidly
becoming
apparent
soon
after
the
conclusion
of
the
late
war
in
the
month
of
december
a
colored
school
for
both
sexes
was
founded
through
the
exertions
of
the
rev
tupper
at
the
state
capital
and
called
the
raleigh
institute
on
account
of
large
donations
from
elijah
shaw
of
massachusetts
and
jacob
estey
of
vermont
it
was
in
changed
in
name
the
male
school
then
became
shaw
university
and
the
female
department
was
called
estey
seminary
spacious
and
edifices
were
reared
on
different
portions
of
the
grounds
and
hundreds
of
colored
pupils
have
been
in
attendance
since
its
foundation
in
a
different
section
of
the
city
exists
another
seminary
of
similar
character
for
the
colored
people
founded
in
by
the
rev
james
brinton
smith
this
is
called
augustine
normal
school
and
collegiate
institute
it
has
been
for
some
years
under
the
charge
of
rev
john
e
smedes
and
is
under
episcopal
patronage
though
not
so
largely
attended
as
shaw
university
it
is
still
of
great
benefit
to
the
race
it
was
intended
to
educate
and
in
this
way
is
also
a
blessing
to
the
community
at

another
excellent
school
for
the
colored
people
is
located
in
fayetteville
and
others
are
to
be
found
in
various
sections
of
the
state
ever
since
the
close
of
the
late
war
the
colored
people
of
north
carolina
have
shown
a
remarkable
unanimity
in
their
efforts
to
procure
education
for
themselves
and
their
children
in
this
desire
they
have
been
nobly
aided
by
the
white
men
and
women
and
their
progress
has
been
rapid
it
is
the
belief
of
all
that
only
in
enlightened
public
sentiment
can
safety
be
found
for
our
peace
and
liberties
and
thus
the

is
doing
all
that
can
be
effected
for

conclusion
in
the
financial
prostration
consequent
upon
the
late
war
a
large
debt
was
due
from
north
carolina
to
creditors
who
held
the
bonds
of
the
state
that
portion
of
these
bonds
which
had
been
issued
before
the
war
was
considered
an
honorable
burden
that
should
be
discharged
by
such
payment
as
might
be
fixed
by
agreement
between
the
state
and
the
bondholders
in
this
way
a
compromise
was
effected
and
new
bonds
have
been
issued
which
embrace
a
large
portion
of
what
was
honestly
due
from
the
state
to
her
creditors
for
those
which
were
made
in
defiance
of
the
terms
of
the
constitution
and
appropriated
almost
entirely
by
dishonest
officials
no
provision
has
been
made
and
doubtless
will
never
be
when
in
the
great
quadrennial
contest
for
the
presidency
of
the
union
again
recurred
it
was
rightly
considered
one
of
the
most
momentous
crises
that
had
yet
occurred
in
american
history
the
great
issue
was
as
to
the
continuance
of
state
governments
the
recent
habits
of
general
grant
in
his
dealing
with
southern
commonwealths
had
virtually
ignored
their
separate
existence
in
the
strange
and
unprecedented
action
of
congress
that
resulted
in
the
seating
of
governor
hayes
as
president
the
federal
troops
were
withdrawn
and
the
people
of
the
states
left
to
administer
their
own
affairs

state

were
recognized

many
needed
appropriations
by

have
been
secured
to

lunatics
are
only
a
portion
of
the
recent
humanities
inaugurated
by
the
general
assembly
perhaps
in
no
other
respect
is
so
much
physical
improvement
possible
as
in
the
development
of
the
mining
interests
of
the
state
capital
from
abroad
is
flowing
in
and
from
many
counties
fresh
discoveries
of
mineral
deposits
are
leading
to
the
establishment
of

firms
for
the
purpose
of
working
such
mines
no
other
state
of

presents
such
a
variety
of

rich

gifts
of

the
recent
discovery
in
the
western
part
of
the
state
of
a
new
gem
called
the
hiddenite
is
attracting
general
attention
and
increasing
the
influx
of
visitors
to
the
romantic
scenery
of
the
mountains
for
years
past
it
has
been
evident
to
intelligent
observers
that
no
bar
exists
to
illimitable
progression
both
to
north
carolina
and
the
great
american
republic
except
in
the
senseless
and
cruel
sectional
hostilities
if
the
people
north
and
south
could
only
be
induced
to
surrender
their
mutual
distrust
and
aversion
thereby
would
disappear
the
last
danger
left
to
the
american
people

agony
as

lay
battling
with

the
hearts
of

were
strangely
drawn
together
in

common
national
calamity

on

it

long
and
painful
struggle
was
ended
and
the
smitten

was
at

eased
of

grief
was

never

been
witnessed
in
the

of

a
death
all
cries

ceased

united
in

general
mourning
the
people

with
one
accord
desire
that
such
a
spirit
may
continue
to
animate

is
an
important
instrument
to
the
people
of
the
state
it
contains
all
the
fundamental
principles
of

that
the

who
study

been
prepared

by
a
