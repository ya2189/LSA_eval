preface
i
have
often
been
asked
to
select
and
epitomize
the
practical
and
especially
the
pedagogical
conclusions
of
my
large
volumes
on
adolescence
published
in
in
such
form
that
they
may
be
available
at
a
minimum
cost
to
parents
teachers
reading
circles
normal
schools
and
college
classes
by
whom
even
the
larger
volumes
have
been
often
used
this
with
the
coöperation
of
the
publishers
and
with
the
valuable
aid
of
superintendent
kendall
of
indianapolis
i
have
tried
to
do
following
in
the
main
the
original
text
with
only
such
minor
changes
and
additions
as
were
necessary
to
bring
the
topics
up
to
date
and
adding
a
new
chapter
on
moral
and
religions
education
for
the
scientific
justification
of
my
educational
conclusions
i
must
of
course
refer
to
the
larger
volumes
the
last
chapter
is
not
in
adolescence
but
is
revised
from
a
paper
printed
elsewhere
i
am
indebted
to

of
all

introduction
characterization
of
the
age
from
eight
to

the
era
of
recapitulating
the
stages
of
primitive
human
development
life
close
to
nature
the
age
also
for

habituation
memory
work
and

adolescence
superposed
upon
this
stage
of
life
but
very
distinct
from
it
the
years
from
about
eight
to
twelve
constitute
a
unique
period
of
human
life
the
acute
stage
of
teething
is
passing
the
brain
has
acquired
nearly
its
adult
size
and
weight
health
is
almost
at
its
best
activity
is
greater
and
more
varied
than
it
ever
was
before
or
ever
will
be
again
and
there
is
peculiar
endurance
vitality
and
resistance
to
fatigue
the
child
develops
a
life
of
its
own
outside
the
home
circle
and
its
natural
interests
are
never
so
independent
of
adult
influence
perception
is
very
acute
and
there
is
great
immunity
to
exposure
danger
accident
as
well
as
to
temptation
reason
true
morality
religion
sympathy
love
and
esthetic
enjoyment
are
but
very
slightly
developed
everything
in
short
suggests
that
this
period
may
represent
in
the
individual
what
was
once
for
a
very
protracted
and
relatively
stationary
period
an
age
of
maturity
in
the
remote
ancestors
of
our
race
when
the
young
of
our
species
who
were
perhaps
pygmoid
shifted
for
themselves
independently
of
further
parental
aid
the
qualities
developed
during
are
in
the
evolutionary
history
of
the
race
far
older
than
hereditary
traits
of
body
and
mind
which
develop
later
and
which
may
be
compared
to
a
new
and
higher
story
built
upon
our
primal
nature
heredity
is
so
far
both
more
stable
and
more
secure
the
elements
of
personality
are
few
but
are
well
organised
on
a
simple
effective
plan
the
momentum
of
these
traits
inherited
from
our
indefinitely
remote
ancestors
is
great
and
they
are
often
clearly
distinguishable
from
those
to
be
added
later
thus
the
boy
is
father
of
the
man
in
a
new
sense
in
that
his
qualities
are
indefinitely
older
and
existed
well
compacted
untold
ages
before
the
more
distinctly
human
attributes
were
developed
indeed
there
are
a
few
faint
indications
of
an
earlier
age
node
at
about
the
age
of
six
as
if
amid
the
instabilities
of
health
we
could
detect
signs
that
this
may
have
been
the
age
of
puberty
in
remote
ages
of
the
past
i
have
also
given
reasons
that
lead
me
to
the
conclusion
that
despite
its
dominance
the
function
of
sexual
maturity
and
procreative
power
is
peculiarly
mobile
up
and
down
the
independently
of
many
of
the
qualities
usually
so
closely
associated
with
it
so
that
much
that
sex
created
in
the
phylum
now
precedes
it
in
the
individual
rousseau
would
leave
prepubescent
years
to
nature
and
to
these
primal
hereditary
impulsions
and
allow
the
fundamental
traits
of
savagery
their
fling
till
twelve
biological
psychology
finds
many
and
cogent
reasons
to
confirm
this
view
only
a
proper
environment
could
be
the
child
revels
in
savagery
and
if
its
tribal
predatory
hunting
fishing
fighting
roving
idle
playing
proclivities
could
be
indulged
in
the
country
and
under
conditions
that
now
alas
seem
hopelessly
ideal
they
could
conceivably
be
so
organized
and
directed
as
to
be
far
more
truly
humanistic
and
liberal
than
all
that
the
best
modern
school
can
provide
rudimentary
organs
of
the
soul
now
suppressed
perverted
or
delayed
to
crop
out
in
menacing
forms
later
would
be
developed
in
their
season
so
that
we
should
be
immune
to
them
in
maturer
years
on
the
principle
of
the
aristotelian
catharsis
for
which
i
have
tried
to
suggest
a
far
broader
application
than
the
stagirite
could
see
in
his
day
these
inborn
and
more
or
less
savage
instincts
can
and
should
be
allowed
some
scope
the
deep
and
strong
cravings
in
the
individual
for
those
primitive
experiences
and
occupations
in
which
his
ancestors
became
skilful
through
the
pressure
of
necessity
should
not
be
ignored
but
can
and
should
be
at
least
partially
satisfied
in
a
vicarious
way
by
tales
from
literature
history
and
tradition
which
present
the
crude
and
primitive
virtues
of
the
heroes
of
the
childhood
in
this
way
aided
by
his
vivid
visual
imagination
the
child
may
enter
upon
his
heritage
from
the
past
live
out
each
stage
of
life
to
its
fullest
and
realize
in
himself
all
its
manifold
tendencies
echoes
only
of
the
vaster
richer
life
of
the
remote
past
of
the
race
they
must
remain
but
just
these
are
the
murmurings
of
the
only
muse
that
can
save
from
the
omnipresent
dangers
of
precocity
thus
we
not
only
rescue
from
the
danger
of
loss
but
utilize
for
further
psychic
growth
the
results
of
the
higher
heredity
which
are
the
most
precious
and
potential
things
on
earth
so
too
in
our
urbanized
hothouse
life
that
tends
to
ripen
everything
before
its
time
we
must
teach
nature
although
the
very
phrase
is
ominous
but
we
must
not
in
so
doing
wean
still
more
from
but
perpetually
incite
to
visit
field
forest
hill
shore
the
water
flowers
animals
the
true
homes
of
childhood
in
this
wild
undomesticated
stage
from
which
modern
conditions
have
kidnapped
and
transported
him
books
and
reading
are
distasteful
for
the
very
soul
and
body
cry
out
for
a
more
active
objective
life
and
to
know
nature
and
man
at
first
hand
these
two
staples
stories
and
nature
by
these
informal
methods
of
the
home
and
the
environment
constitute
fundamental
education
but
now
another
remove
from
nature
seems
to
be
made
necessary
by
the
manifold
knowledges
and
skills
of
our
highly
complex
civilization
we
should
transplant
the
human
sapling
i
concede
reluctantly
as
early
as
eight
but
not
before
to
the
schoolhouse
with
its
imperfect
lighting
ventilation
temperature
we
must
shut
out
nature
and
open
books
the
child
must
sit
on
unhygienic
benches
and
work
the
tiny
muscles
that
wag
the
tongue
and
pen
and
let
all
the
others
which
constitute
nearly
half
its
weight
decay
even
if
it
be
prematurely
he
must
be
subjected
to
special
disciplines
and
be
apprenticed
to
the
higher
qualities
of
adulthood
for
he
is
not
only
a
product
of
nature
but
a
candidate
for
a
highly
developed
humanity
to
many
if
not
most
of
the
influences
here
there
can
be
at
first
but
little
inner
response
insight
understanding
interest
sentiment
are
for
the
most
part
only
nascent
and
most
that
pertains
to
the
true
kingdom
of
mature
manhood
is
embryonic
the
wisest
requirements
seem
to
the
child
more
or
less
alien
arbitrary
heteronomous
artificial
falsetto
there
is
much
passivity
often
active
resistance
and
evasion
and
perhaps
spasms
of
obstinacy
to
it
all
but
the
senses
are
keen
and
alert
reactions
immediate
and
vigorous
and
the
memory
is
quick
sure
and
lasting
and
ideas
of
space
time
and
physical
causation
and
of
many
a
moral
and
social
licit
and
are
rapidly
unfolding
never
again
will
there
be
such
susceptibility
to
drill
and
discipline
such
plasticity
to
habituation
or
such
ready
adjustment
to
new
conditions
it
is
the
age
of
external
and
mechanical
training
reading
writing
drawing
manual
training
musical
technic
foreign
tongues
and
their
pronunciations
the
manipulation
of
numbers
and
of
geometrical
elements
and
many
kinds
of
skill
have
now
their
golden
hour
and
if
it
passes
unimproved
all
these
can
never
be
acquired
later
without
a
heavy
handicap
of
disadvantage
and
loss
these
necessities
may
be
hard
for
the
health
of
body
sense
mind
as
well
as
for
morals
and
pedagogic
art
consists
in
breaking
the
child
into
them
betimes
as
intensely
and
as
quickly
as
possible
with
minimal
strain
and
with
the
least
amount
of
explanation
or
coquetting
for
natural
interest
and
in
calling
medicine
confectionery
this
is
not
teaching
in
its
true
sense
so
much
as
it
is
drill
inculcation
and
regimentation
the
method
should
be
mechanical
repetitive
authoritative
dogmatic
the
automatic
powers
are
now
at
their
very
apex
and
they
can
do
and
bear
more
than
our
degenerate
pedagogy
knows
or
dreams
of
here
we
have
something
to
learn
from
the
schoolmasters
of
the
past
back
to
the
middle
ages
and
even
from
the
ancients
the
greatest
stress
with
short
periods
and
few
hours
incessant
insistence
incitement
and
little
reliance
upon
interest
reason
or
work
done
without
the
presence
of
the
teacher
should
be
the
guiding
principles
for
pressure
in
these
essentially
formal
and
to
the
child
contentless
elements
of
knowledge
these
should
be
sharply
distinguished
from
the
indigenous
evoking
and
more
truly
educational
factors
described
in
the
last
paragraph
which
are
meaty
and
relatively
formless
as
to
time
of
day
method
spirit
and
perhaps
environment
and
personnel
of
teacher
and
possibly
somewhat
in
season
of
the
year
almost
as
sharply
as
work
differs
from
play
or
perhaps
as
the
virility
of
man
that
loves
to
command
a
phalanx
be
a
martinet
and
differs
from
femininity
which
excels
in
persuasion
sympathetic
insight
and
in
the
tact
that
discerns
and
utilizes
spontaneous
interests
in
the
young
adolescence
is
a
new
birth
for
the
higher
and
more
completely
human
traits
are
now
born
the
qualities
of
body
and
soul
that
now
emerge
are
far
newer
the
child
comes
from
and
harks
back
to
a
remoter
past
the
adolescent
is
and
in
him
the
later
acquisitions
of
the
race
slowly
become
prepotent
development
is
less
gradual
and
more
saltatory
suggestive
of
some
ancient
period
of
storm
and
stress
when
old
moorings
were
broken
and
a
higher
level
attained
the
annual
rate
of
growth
in
height
weight
and
strength
is
increased
and
often
doubled
and
even
more
important
functions
previously
arise
growth

as
high
as

of

of
the

that

that

all
this
shows
how
we
have
modified
the
antique
ciceronian
conception
est

live
is
to
think
to
est
to

is
to
will
and
gives
us
a
new
sense
of
the
importance
of
muscular
development
and
regimen
modern
psychology
thus
sees
in
muscles
organs
of
expression
for
all
efferent
processes
beyond
all
their
demonstrable
functions
every
change
of
attention
and
of
psychic
states
generally
plays
upon
them
unconsciously
modifying
their
tension
in
subtle
ways
so
that
they
may
be
called
organs
of
thought
and
feeling
as
well
as
of
will
in
which
some
now
see
the
true
kantian

determine

nothing

the

and
for
all

is
incomplete
without

may
almost
be
called
muscular

and
fatigue
velleity
caprice
restlessness
lack
of
control
and

muscular
faults
to
understand
the
momentous
changes
of
motor
functions
that
characterize
adolescence
we
must
consider
other
than
the
measurable
aspects
of
the
subject
perhaps
the
best
scale
on
which
to
measure
all
normal
growth
of
muscle
structure
and
functions
is
found
in
the
progress
from
fundamental
to
accessory
the
former
designates
the
muscles
and
movements
of
the
trunk
and
large
joints
neck
back
hips
shoulders
knees
and
elbows
sometimes
called
central
and
which
in
general
man
has
in
common
with
the
higher
and
larger
animals
their
activities
are
few
mostly
simultaneous
alternating
and
rhythmic
as
of
the
legs
in
walking
and
predominate
in
men
and
women
with
little
culture
or
intelligence
and
often
in
idiots
the
latter
or
accessory
movements
are
those
of
the
hand
tongue
face
and
articulatory
organs
and
these
may
be
connected
into
a
long
and
greatly
diversified
series
as
those
used
in
writing
talking
they
are
represented
by
smaller
and
more
numerous
muscles
whose
functions
develop
later
in
life
and
represent
a
higher
standpoint
of
evolution
these
smaller
muscles
for
finer
movements
come
into
function
later
and
are
chiefly
associated
with
psychic
activity
which
plays
upon
them
by
incessantly
changing
their
tensions
if
not
causing
actual
movement
it
is
these
that
are
so
liable
to
disorder
in
the
many
automatisms
and
choreic
tics
we
see
in
school
children
especially
if
excited
or
fatigued
general
paralysis
usually
begins
in
the
higher
levels
by
breaking
these
down
so
that
the
first
symptom
of
its
insidious
and
never
interrupted
progress
is
inability
to
execute
the
more
exact
and
delicate
movements
of
tongue
or
hand
or
both
starting
with
the
latest
evolutionary
level
it
is
a
devolution
that
may
work
downward
till
very
many
of
the
fundamental
activities
are
lost
before
death
nothing
better
illustrates
this
distinction
than
the
difference
between
the
fore
foot
of
animals
and
the
human
hand
the
first
begins
as
a
fin
or
paddle
or
is
armed
with
a
hoof
and
is
used
solely
for
locomotion
some
carnivora
with
claws
use
the
fore
limb
also
for
holding
well
as
tearing
and
others
for
digging
arboreal
life
seems
to
have
almost
created
the
simian
hand
and
to
have
wrought
a
revolution
in
the
form
and
use
of
the
forearm
and
its
accessory
organs
the
fingers
apes
and
other
creatures
must
not
only
adjust
their
prehensile
organ
to
a
wide
variety
of
distances
and
sizes
of
branches
but
must
use
the
hands
more
or
less
freely
for
picking
transporting
and
eating
fruit
and
this
has
probably
been
a
prime
factor
in
lifting
man
to
the
erect
position
without
which
human
intelligence
as
we
know
it
could
have
hardly
been
possible
when
we
attempt
to
measure
the
gap
between
man
and
the
lower
animals
in
terms
of
the
form
of
movement
the
wonder
is
no
less
great
than
when
we
use
the
term
of
mentality
the
degree
of
approximation
to
human
intelligence
in
anthropoid
animals
follows
very
closely
the
degree
of
approximation
to
human
movements
the
gradual
acquirement
of
the
erect
position
by
the
human
infant
admirably
repeats
this
long
phylogenetic
evolution
at
first
the
limbs
are
of
almost
no
use
in
locomotion
but
the
fundamental
trunk
muscles
with
those
that
move
the
large
joints
are
more
or
less
spasmodically
active
then
comes
creeping
with
use
of
the
hip
muscles
while
all
below
the
knee
is
useless
as
also
are
the
fingers
slowly
the
leg
and
foot
are
degraded
to
locomotion
slowly
the
great
toe
becomes
more
limited
in
its
action
the
thumb
increases
in
flexibility
and
strength
of
opposition
and
the
fingers
grow
more
mobile
and
controllable
as
the
body
slowly
assumes
the
vertical
attitude
the
form
of
the
chest
changes
till
its
greatest
diameter
is
transverse
instead
of
from
front
to
back
the
are
less
parallel
than
in
quadrupeds
and
spread
out
till
they
approximate
the
same
plane
this
gives
the
arm
freedom
of
movement
laterally
so
that
it
can
be
rotated
one
hundred
and
eighty
degrees
in
man
as
contrasted
to
one
hundred
degrees
in
apes
thus
giving
man
the
command
of
almost
any
point
within
a
sphere
of
which
the
two
arms
are
radii
the
power
of
grasping
was
partly
developed
from
and
partly
added
to
the
old
locomotor
function
of
the
fore
limbs
the
jerky
aimless
automatisms
as
well
as
the
slow
rhythmic
flexion
and
extension
of
the
fingers
and
hand
movements
which
are
perhaps
survivals
of
arboreal
or
of
even
earlier
aquatic
life
are
coördinated
and
the
bilateral
and
simultaneous
rhythmic
movements
of
the
heavier
muscles
are
supplemented
by
the
more
finely
adjusted
and
specialized
activities
which
as
the
end
of
the
growth
period
is
approached
are
determined
less
by
heredity
and
more
by
environment
in
a
sense
a
child
or
a
man
is
the
sum
total
of
his
movements
or
tendencies
to
move
and
nature
and
instinct
chiefly
determine
the
basal
and
education
the
accessory
parts
of
our
activities
the
entire
accessory
system
is
thus
of
vital
importance
for
the
development
of
all
of
the
arts
of
expression
these
smaller
muscles
might
almost
be
called
organs
of
thought
their
tension
is
modified
with
the
faintest
change
of
soul
such
as
is
seen
in
accent
inflection
facial
expressions
handwriting
and
many
forms
of
which
in
fact
is
always
the
of
low
intelligence
with
a
practical
vocabulary
of
not
over
five
hundred
words
who
can
hardly
move
each
of
his
fingers
without
moving
others
or
all
of
them
who
can
not
move
his
brows
or
corrugate
his
forehead
at
will
and
whose
inflection
is
very
monotonous
illustrates
a
condition
of
arrest
or
atrophy
of
this
later
finer
accessory
system
of
muscles
on
the
other
hand
the
child
precocious
in
any
or
all
of
these
later
respects
is
very
liable
to
be
undeveloped
in
the
larger
and
more
fundamental
parts
and
functions
the
full
unfoldment
of
each
is
in
fact
an
inexorable
condition
precedent
for
the
normal
development
to
full
and
abiding
maturity
of
the
higher
and
more
refined
muscularity
just
as
conversely
the
awkwardness
and
clumsiness
of
adolescence
mark
a
temporary
loss
of
balance
in
the
opposite
direction
if
this
general
conception
be
correct
then
nature
does
not
finish
the
basis
of
her
pyramid
in
the
way
ross
mercier
and
others
have
assumed
but
lays
a
part
of
the
foundation
and
after
carrying
it
to
an
apex
normally
goes
back
and
adds
to
the
foundation
to
carry
up
the
apex
still
higher
and
if
prevented
from
so
doing
expends
her
energy
in
building
the
apex
up
at
a
sharper
angle
till
instability
results
school
and
kindergarten
often
lay
a
disproportionate
strain
on
the
tiny
accessory
muscles
weighing
altogether
but
a
few
ounces
that
wag
the
tongue
move
the
pen
and
do
fine
work
requiring
accuracy
but
still
at
this
stage
prolonged
work
requiring
great
accuracy
is
irksome
and
brings
dangers
homologous
to
those
caused
by
too
much
fine
work
in
the
kindergarten
before
the
first
adjustment
of
large
to
small
muscles
which
lasts
until
adolescence
is
established
then
disproportion
between
function
and
growth
often
causes
symptoms
of
chorea
the
chief
danger
is
arrest
of
the
development
and
control
of
the
smaller
muscles
many
occupations
and
forms
of
athletics
on
the
contrary
place
the
stress
mainly
upon
groups
of
fundamental
muscles
to
the
neglect
of
finer
motor
possibilities
some
who
excel
in
heavy
athletics
no
doubt
coarsen
their
motor
reactions
become
not
only
inexact
and
heavy
but
unresponsive
to
finer
stimuli
as
if
the
large
muscles
were
hypertrophied
and
the
small
ones
arrested
on
the
other
hand
many
young
men
and
probably
more
young
women
expend
too
little
of
their
available
active
energy
upon
basal
and
massive
muscle
work
and
cultivate
too
much
and
above
all
too
early
the
delicate
responsive
work
this
is
perhaps
the
best
physiological
characterization
of
precocity
and
issues
in
excessive
nervous
and
muscular
irritability
the
great
influx
of
muscular
vigor
that
unfolds
during
adolescent
years
and
which
was
originally
not
only
necessary
to
successful
propagation
but
expressive
of
virility
seems
to
be
a
very
plastic
quantity
so
that
motor
regimen
and
exercise
at
this
stage
is
probably
more
important
and
for
mentality
sexuality
and
health
than
at
any
other
period
of
life
intensity
and
for
a
time
a
spurty
diathesis
is
as
instinctive
and
desirable
as
are
the
copious
minor
automatisms
which
spontaneously
give
the
alphabet
out
of
which
complex
and
finer
motor
series
are
later
spelled
by
the
conscious
will
mercier
and
others
have
pointed
out
that
as
most
skilled
labor
so
school
work
and
modern
activities
in
civilized
life
generally
lay
premature
and
disproportionate
strains
upon
those
kinds
of
movement
requiring
exactness
stress
upon
basal
movements
is
not
only
compensating
but
is
of
higher
therapeutic
value
against
the
disorders
of
the
accessory
system
it
constitutes
the
best
core
or
prophylactic
for
fidgets
and
tense
states
and
directly
develops
poise
control
and
equilibrium
even
when
contractions
reach
choreic
intensity
the
best
treatment
is
to
throw
activities
down
the
scale
that
measures
the
difference
between
primary
and
secondary
movements
and
to
make
the
former
predominate
the
number
of
movements
the
frequency
with
which
they
are
repeated
their
diversity
the
number
of
combinations
and
their
total

whether
we

the
kindergarten
grades
and
fall
off
rapidly
in
the
primary
grades
are
greater
with
tasks
requiring
fine
and
exact
movements
than
with
those
involving
large
movements
automatisms
are
often
a
sign
of
the
difficulty
of
tasks
the
restlessness
that
they
often
express
is
one
of
the
commonest
signs
of
fatigue
they
are
mostly
in
the
accessory
muscles
while
those
of
the
fundamental
muscles
body
legs
and
arms
disappear
rapidly
with
age
those
of
eye
brow
and
jaw
show
greatest
increase
with
age
but
their
frequency
in
general
declines
with
growing
maturity
although
there
is
increased
frequency
of
certain
specialized
contractions
which
indicate
the
gradual
settling
of
expression
in
the
face
often
such
movements
pass
over
by
insensible
gradation
into
the
morbid
automatism
of
chorea
and
in
yet
lower
levels
of
decay
we
see
them
in
the
aimless
picking
and
plucking
movements
of
the
fingers
of
the
sick
in
idiots
arrest
of
higher
powers
often
goes
with
hypertrophy
of
these
movements
as
seen
in
as
if
just
as
nature
impels
those
partially
blind
to
rub
the
eyes
for
so
it
prompts
the
to
strike
the
head
for
cerebrations
rockers
rackers
shakers
biters
etc
movements
often
pass
to
fixed
attitudes
and
postures
of
limbs
or

disturbing
the
normal
balance
between
flexors
and
extensors
the
significance
of
which
as
nerve

or
exponents
of
habitual
brain
states
and
tensions
warner
has
so
admirably
shown
abundance
and
vigor
of
automatic
movements
are
desirable
and
even
a
considerable
degree
of
restlessness
is
a
good
sign
in
young
children
many
of
what
are
now
often
called
nerve
signs
and
even
choreic
symptoms
the
fidgetiness
in
school
on
cloudy
days
and
often
after
a
vacation
the
motor
superfluities
of
awkwardness
embarrassment
extreme
effort
excitement
fatigue
sleepiness
are
simply
the
forms
in
which
we
receive
the
full
momentum
of
heredity
and
mark
a
natural
richness
of
the
raw
material
of
intellect
feeling
and
especially
of
will
hence
they
must
be
abundant
all
parts
should
act
in
all
possible
ways
at
first
and
untrammeled
by
the
activity
of
all
other
parts
and
functions
some
of
these
activities
are
more
essential
for
growth
in
size
than
are
later
and
more
conscious
movements
here
as
everywhere
the
rule
holds
that
powers
themselves
must
be
unfolded
before
the
ability
to
check
or
even
to
use
them
can
develop
all
movements
arising
from
spontaneous
activity
of
nerve
cells
or
centers
must
be
made
in
order
even
to
avoid
the
atrophy
of
disease
not
only
so
but
this
purer
kind
of
innateness
must
often
be
helped
out
to
some
extent
in
some
children
by
stimulating
reflexes
a
rich
and
wide
repertory
of
sensation
must
be
made
familiar
more
or
less
and
very
guarded
watched
and
limited
experiences
of
hunger
thirst
cold
heat
tastes
sounds
smells
colors
brightnesses
tactile
irritations
and
perhaps
even
occasional
tickling
and
pain
to
play
off
the
vastly
complex
function
of
laughing
crying
may
in
some
cases
be
judicious
conscious
and
unconscious
imitation
or
repetition
of
every
sort
of
copy
may
also
help
to
establish
the
immediate
and
connection
between
afferent
and
efferent
processes
that
brings
the
organism
into
direct
and
harmony
with
the
whole
world
of
sense
perhaps
the
more
rankly
and
independently
they
are
developed
to
full
functional
integrity
each
in
its
season
if
we
only
knew
that
season
the
better
premature
control
by
higher
centers
or
coördination
into
higher
compounds
of
habits
and
ordered
serial
activities
is
repressive
and
wasteful
and
the
mature
will
of
which
they
are
components
or
which
must
at
least
domesticate
them
is
stronger
and
more
forcible
if
this
serial
stage
is
not
unduly
abridged
but
secondly
many
if
not
most
of
these
activities
when
developed
a
little
group
after
group
as
they
arise
must
be
controlled
checked
and
organized
into
higher
and
often
more
serial
compounds
the
inhibiting
functions
are
at
first
hard
in
trying
to
sit
still
the
child
sets
its
teeth
holds
the
breath
clenches
its
fists
and
perhaps
makes
every
muscle
tense
with
a
great
effort
that
very
soon
exhausts
this
repressive
function
is
probably
not
worked
from
special
nervous
centers
nor
can
we
speak
with
confidence
of
collisions
with
sums
of
arrest
in
a
sense
analogous
to
that
of
herbart
or
of
stimuli
that
normally
cause
catabolic
molecular
processes
in
the
cell
being
mysteriously
diverted
to
produce
increased
instability
or
anabolic
lability
in
the
sense
of
wundt
der
the
concept
now
suggested
by
many
facts
is
that
inhibition
is
irradiation
or
long
circuiting
to
higher
and
more
complex
brain
areas
so
that
the
energy
whether
spontaneous
or
reflex
is
diverted
to
be
used
elsewhere
these
combinations
are
of
a
higher
order
more
remote
from
reflex
action
and
modified
by
some
jacksonian
third
level
action
is
now
not
from
independent
centers
but
these
are
slowly
associated
so
that
excitation
may
flow
off
from
one
point
to
any
other
and
any
reaction
may
result
from
any
stimulus
the
more
unified
the
brain
the
less
it
suffers
from
localization
and
the
lower
is
the
level
to
which
any
one
function
can
exhaust
the
whole
the
tendency
of
each
group
of
cells
to
discharge
or
overflow
into
those
of
lower
tension
than
themselves
increases
as
correspondence
in
time
and
space
widens
the
more
one
of
a
number
of
activities
gains
in
power
to
draw
on
all
the
brain
or
the
more
readily
the
active
parts
are
fed
at
cost
of
the
resting
parts
the
less
is
rest
to
be
found
in
change
from
one
of
these
activities
to
another
and
the
less
do
concentration
and
specialization
prove
to
be
dangerous
before
the
aim
was
to
wake
all
parts
to
function
now
it
is
to
connect
them
intensity
of
this
activity
now
tends
to
unity
so
that
all
parts
of
the
brain
energize
together
in
a
brain
with
this
switchboard
function
well
organized
each
reaction
has
grown
independent
of
its
own
stimulus
and
may
result
from
any
stimulation
and
each
act
a
finger
movement
of
a
peculiar
nature
may
tire
the
whole
brain
this
helps
us
to
understand
why
so
often
excel
laborers
not
only
in
sudden
dynamometric
strength
test
but
in
sustained
and
effort
in
a
good
brain
or
in
a
good
machine
power
may
thus
be
developed
over
a
large
surface
and
all
of
it
applied
to
a
small
one
and
hence
the
dangers
of
specialization
are
lessened
in
exact
proportion
as
the
elements
of
our
ego
are
thus
compacted
together
it
is
in
the
variety
and
delicacy
of
these
combinations
and
all
that
they
imply
far
more
than
in
the
elements
of
which
they
are
composed
that
man
rises
farthest
above
the
higher
animals
and
of
these
powers
later
adolescence
is
the
golden
age
the
aimless
and
archaic
movements
of
infancy
whether
massive
and
complex
or
in
the
form
of
isolated
automatic
tweaks
or
twinges
are
thus
by
slow
processes
of
combined
analysis
and
synthesis
involving
changes
as
radical
as
any
in
all
the
world
of
growth
made
over
into
habits
and
conduct
that
fit
the
world
of
present
environment
but
thirdly
this
long
process
carried
out
with
all
degrees
of
completeness
may
be
arrested
at
any
unfinished
stage
some
automatisms
refuse
to
be
controlled
by
the
will
and
both
they
and
it
are
often
overworked
here
we
must
distinguish
constantly
between
those
growing
rankly
in
order
to
be
later
organized
under
the
will
and
those
that
have
become
feral
after
this
domestication
of
them
has
lost
power
from
disease
or
fatigue
and
those
that
have
never
been
subjugated
because
the
central
power
that
should
have
used
them
to
weave
the
texture
of
willed
action
the
proper
language
of
complete
manhood
was
itself
arrested
or
degenerate
with
regard
to
many
of
these
movements
these
distinctions
can
be
made
with
confidence
and
in
some
children
more
certainly
than
in
others
in
childhood
before
twelve
the
efferent
patterns
should
be
developed
into
many
more
or
less
indelible
habits
and
their
colors
set
fast
motor
specialties
requiring
exactness
and
grace
like
drawing
writing
pronunciation
of
a
foreign
tongue
dancing
acting
singing
and
a
host
of
virtuosities
must
be
well
begun
before
the
relative
arrest
of
accessory
growth
at
the
dawn
of
the
ephebic
regeneration
and
before
its
great
afflux
of
strength
the
facts
seem
to
show
that
children
of
this
age
such
as
hancock
described
who
could
not
stand
with
feet
close
together
and
eyes
closed
without
swaying
much
could
not
walk
backward
sit
still
half
a
minute
dress
alone
tie
two
ends
of
a
string
together
interlace
slats
wind
thread
spin
a
top
stand
on
toes
or
heels
hop
on
each
foot
drive
a
nail
roll
a
hoop
skate
hit
fingers
together
rapidly
in
succession
beginning
at
the
little
finger
and
then
reversing
are
the
very
ones
in
whom
automatisms
are
most
marked
or
else
they
are
those
constitutionally
inert
dull
or
uneducable
in
children
these
motor
residua
may
persist
as
characteristic
features
of
inflection
accent
or
manners
automatisms
may
become
morbid
in
stammering
or
stuttering
or
they
may
be
seen
in
gait
handwriting
tics
or
tweaks
etc
instead
of
disappearing
with
age
as
they
should
they
are
seen
in
the
blind
as
facial
grimaces
uncorrected
by
the
mirror
or
facial
consciousness
in
the
deaf
as
inarticulate
noises
and
they
may
tend
to
grow
monstrous
with
age
as
if
they
were
disintegrated
fragments
of
our
personality
split
off
and
aborted
or
motor
parasites
leaving
our
ego
poorer
in
energy
and
plasticity
of
adaptation
till
the
distraction
and
anarchy
of
the
individual
nature
becomes
conspicuous
and
pathetic
at
puberty
however
when
muscle
habits
are
so
plastic
when
there
is
a
new
relation
between
quantity
or
volume
of
motor
energy
and
qualitative
differentiation
and
between
volitional
control
and
reflex
activities
these
kinetic
remnants
strongly
tend
to
shoot
together
into
wrong
aggregates
if
right
ones
are
not
formed
good
manners
and
correct
motor
form
generally
as
well
as
skill
are
the
most
economic
ways
of
doing
things
but
this
is
the
age
of
wasteful
ways
awkwardness
mannerisms
tensions
that
are
a
constant
leakage
of
vital
energy
perhaps
acts
contortions
quaint
movements
more
elaborated
than
in
childhood
and
often
highly
anesthetic
and
disagreeable
motor
coördinations
that
will
need
laborious
decomposition
later
the
avoidable
factor
in
their
causation
is
with
some
modification
not
unlike
that
of
the
simpler
feral
movements
and
faulty
attitudes
carriage
and
postures
in
children
some
form
of
overpressure
or
misfit
between
environment
and
nature
as
during
the
years
from
four
to
eight
there
is
great
danger
that
overemphasis
of
the
activities
of
the
accessory
muscles
will
sow
the
seeds
of
chorea
or
aggravate
predispositions
to
it
now
again
comes
a
greatly
increased
danger
hardly
existing
from
eight
to
twelve
that
overprecision
especially
if
fundamental
activities
are
neglected
will
bring
nervous
strain
and
stunting
precocity
this
is
again
the
age
of
the
basal
muscle
of
leg
and
back
and
shoulder
work
and
of
the
yet
more
fundamental
heart
lung
and
chest
muscles
now
again
the
study
of
a
book
under
the
usual
conditions
of
sitting
in
a
closed
space
and
using
pen
tongue
and
eye
combined
has
a
tendency
to
overstimulate
the
accessory
muscles
this
is
especially
harmful
for
city
children
who
are
too
prone
to
the
distraction
of
overmobility
at
an
age
especially
exposed
to
maladjustment
of
motor
income
and
expenditure
and
it
constitutes
not
a
liberal
or
but
a
highly
and
prematurely
specialized
narrowing
and
weakening
education
unless
offset
by
safeguards
better
than
any
system
of
gymnastics
which
is
at
best
artificial
and
exaggerated
as
bryan
well
says
the
efficiency
of
a
machine
depends
so
far
as
we
know
upon
the
maximum
force
rate
amplitude
and
variety
of
direction
of
its
movements
and
upon
the
exactness
with
which
below
these
maxima
the
force
rate
amplitude
and
direction
of
the
movements
can
be
controlled
the
motor
efficiency
of
a
man
depends
upon
his
ability
in
all
these
respects
moreover
the
education
of
the
small
muscles
and
fine
adjustments
of
larger
ones
is
as
near
mental
training
as
physical
culture
can
get
for
these
are
the
and
movements
and
their
perfected
function
is
to
reflect
and
express
by
slight
modifications
of
tension
and
tone
every
psychic
change
only
the
brain
itself
is
more
closely
and
immediately
an
organ
of
thought
than
are
these
muscles
and
their
activity
reflex
spontaneous
or
imitative
in
origin
whether
any
of
them
are
of
value
as
lindley
thinks
in
arousing
the
brain
to
activity
or
as
müller
suggests
in
drawing
off
sensations
or
venting
efferent
impulses
that
would
otherwise
distract
we
need
not
here
discuss
if
so
this
is
of
course
a
secondary
and
late
function
nature
way
of
making
the
best
of
things
and
utilizing
remnants
with
these
facts
and
their
implications
in
mind
we
can
next
pass
to
consider
the
conditions
under
which
the
adolescent
muscles
best
develop
here
we
confront
one
of
the
greatest
and
most
difficult
problems
of
our
age
changes
in
modern
motor
life
have
been
so
vast
and
sudden
as
to
present
some
of
the
most
comprehensive
and
dangers
that
threaten
civilized
races
not
only
have
the
forms
of
labor
been
radically
changed
within
a
generation
or
two
but
the
basal
activities
that
shaped
the
body
of
primitive
man
have
been
suddenly
swept
away
by
the
new
methods
of
modern
industry
even
popular
sports
games
and
recreations
so
abundant
in
the
early
life
of
all
progressive
peoples
have
been
reduced
and
transformed
and
the
play
age
that
once
extended
on
to
middle
life
and
often
old
age
has
been
restricted
sedentary
life
in
schools
and
offices
as
we
have
seen
is
reducing
the
vigor
and
size
of
our
lower
limbs
our
industry
is
no
longer
under
hygienic
conditions
and
instead
of
being
out
of
doors
in
the
country
or
of
highly
diversified
kinds
it
is
now
specialized
monotonous
carried
on
in
closed
spaces
bad
air
and
perhaps
poor
light
especially
in
cities
the
diseases
and
arrest
bred
in
the
young
by
life
in
shops
offices
factories
and
schools
increase
work
is
rigidly
bound
to
fixed
hours
uniform
standards
stints
and
and
instead
of
a
finished
article
each
individual
now
achieves
a
part
of
a
single
process
and
knows
little
of
those
that
precede
or
follow
machinery
has
relieved
the
large
basal
muscles
and
laid
more
stress
upon
fine
and
exact
movements
that
involve
nerve
strain
the
coarser
forms
of
work
that
involve
hard
lifting
carrying
digging
are
themselves
specialized
and
skilled
labor
requires
more
and
more
it
has
been
estimated
that
the
diminution
of
manual
labor
required
to
do
a
given
quantity
of
work
in
as
compared
with
is
no
less
than
per
cent
personal
interest
in
and
the
old
native
sense
of
responsibility
for
results
ownership
and
use
of
the
finished
products
which
have
been
the
inspiration
and
soul
of
work
in
all
the
past
are
in
more
and
more
fields
gone
those
who
realize
how
small
a
proportion
of
the
young
male
population
train
or
even
engage
in
amateur
sports
with
zest
and
regularity
how
very
few
and
picked
men
strive
for
records
and
how
immediate
and
amazing
are
the
results
of
judicious
training
can
best
understand
how
far
below
his
possibilities
as
a
motor
being
the
average
modern
man
goes
through
life
and
how
far
short
in
this
respect
he
falls
from
fulfilling
nature
design
for
him
for
unnumbered
generations
primitive
man
in
the
nomad
age

made
perhaps
annual
migrations
and
bore
heavy
burdens
while
we
ride
relatively
unencumbered

tilled
the
reluctant
soil

with
rude
implements
where
we
use
machines
of
many
in
the
stone
iron
and
bronze
age
he
shaped
stone
and
metals
and
wrought
with
infinite
pains
and
effort
products
that
we
buy
without
even
knowledge
of
the
processes
by
which
they
are
made
as
hunter
he
followed
game
which
when
found
he
chased
fought
and
overcame
in
a
struggle
perhaps
desperate
while
we
shoot
it
at
a
distance
with
little
risk
or
effort
in
warfare

fought

adolescent
girls
especially
in
the
middle
classes
in
upper
grammar
and
high
school
grades
during
the
golden
age
for
nascent
muscular
development
suffer
perhaps
most
of
all
in
this
respect
grave
as
are
the
evils
of
child
labor
i
believe
far
more
pubescents
in
this
country
now
suffer
from
too
little
than
from
too
much
physical
exercise
while
most
who
suffer
from
work
do
so
because
it
is
too
uniform
accessory
or
performed
under
unwholesome
conditions
and
not
because
it
is
excessive
in
amount
modern
industry
has
thus
largely
ceased
to
be
a
means
of
physical
development
and
needs
to
be
offset
by
compensating
modes
of
activity
many
devices
increase
neural
strain
so
that
one
of
the
problems
of
our
time
is
how
to
preserve
and
restore
nerve
energy
under
present
industrial
systems
this
must
grow
worse
and
not
better
in
the
future
healthy
natural
industries
will
be
less
and
less
open
to
the
young
this
is
the
new
situation
that
now
confronts
those
concerned
for
motor
education
if
they
would
only
make
good
what
is
lost
some
of
the
results
of
these
conditions
are
seen
in
average
measurements
of
dimensions
proportions
strength
skill
and
control
despite
the
excellence
of
the
few
the
testimony
of
those
most
familiar
with
the
bodies
of
children
and
adults
and
their
physical
powers
gives
evidence
of
the
ravages
of
modern
modes
of
life
that
without
a
motor
revival
can
bode
only
degeneration
for
our
nation
and
our
race
the
number
of
common
things
that
can
not
be
done
at
all
the
large
proportion
of
our
youth
who
must
be
exempted
from
any
kinds
of
activity
or
a
great
amount
of
any
the
thin
limbs
collapsed
shoulders
or
chests
the
bilateral
asymmetry
weak
hearts
lungs
eyes
puny
and
bad
muddy
or
pallid
complexions
tired
ways
automatism
dyspeptic
stomachs
the
effects
of
youthful
error
or
of
impoverished
heredity
delicate
and
tender
nurture
often
alas
only
too
necessary
show
the
lamentable
and
cumulative
effects
of
long
neglect
of
the
motor
abilities
the
most
educable
of
all
man
powers
and
perhaps
the
most
important
for
his
if
the
unfaithful
stewards
of
these
puny
and
shameful
bodies
had
again
as
in
sparta
to
strip
and
stand
before
stern
judges
and
render
them
account
and
be
smitten
with
a
conviction
of
their
weakness
guilty
deformity
and
arrest
of
growth
if
they
were
brought
to
realize
how
they
are
fallen
beings
as
weak
as
stern
theologians
once
deemed
them
depraved
and
how
great
their
need
of
physical
salvation
we
might
hope
again
for
a
physical
renaissance
such
a
rebirth
the
world
has
seen
but
twice
or
perhaps
thrice
and
each
was
followed
by
the
two
or
three
of
the
brightest
culture
periods
of
history
and
formed
an
epoch
in
the
advancement
of
the
kingdom
of
man
a
vast
body
of
evidence
could
be
collected
from
the
writings
of
anthropologists
showing
how
superior
unspoiled
savages
are
to
civilized
man
in
correct
or
esthetic
proportions
of
body
in
many
forms
of
endurance
of
fatigue
hardship
and
power
to
bear
exposure
in
the
development
and
preservation
of
teeth
and
hair
in
keenness
of
senses
absence
of
deformities
as
well
as
immunity
to
many
of
our
diseases
their
women
are
stronger
and
bear
hardship
and
exposure
monthly
periods
and
childbirth
better
civilization
is
so
hard
on
the
body
that
some
have
called
it
a
disease
despite
the
arts
that
keep
puny
bodies
alive
to
a
greater
average
age
and
our
greater
protection
from
contagious
and
germ
diseases
the
progressive
realization
of
these
tendencies
has
prompted
most
of
the
best
recent
and
great
changes
in
education
and
also
in
personal
regimen
and
agencies
have
put
to
school
the
large
motor
areas
of
the
brain
so
long
neglected
and
have
vastly
enlarged
their
scope
thousands
of
youth
are
now
inspired
with
new
enthusiasm
for
physical
development
and
new
institutions
of
many
kinds
and
grades
have
arisen
with
a
voluminous
literature
unnumbered
specialists
specialties
new
apparatus
tests
movements
methods
and
theories
and
the
press
the
public
and
the
church
are
awakened
to
a
fresh
interest
in
the
body
and
its
powers
all
this
is
magnificent
but
sadly
inadequate
to
cope
with
the
new
needs
and
dangers
which
are
vastly
greater

hughlings
jackson
the
eminent
english
pathologist
was
the
first
to
make
practical
application
of
the
evolutionary
theory
of
the
nervous
system
to
the
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
epilepsies
and
mental
diseases
the
practical
success
of
this
application
was
so
great
that
the
theory
is
now
the
established
basis
of
english
diagnosis
he
conceived
the
nervous
mechanism
as
composed
of
three
systems
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
hierarchy
the
higher
including
the
lower
and
yet
each
having
a
certain
degree
of
independence
the
first
level
represents
the
type
of
simplest
reflex
and
involuntary
movement
and
is
localized
in
the
gray
matter
of
the
spinal
cord
medulla
and
pons
the
second
or
middle
level
comprises
those
structures
which
receive
sensory
impulses
from
the
cells
of
the
lowest
level
instead
of
directly
from
the
periphery
or
the
tissues
the
motor
cells
of
this
middle
level
also
discharge
into
the
motor
mechanisms
of
the
lowest
level
jackson
located
these
middle
level
structures
in
the
cortex
of
the
central
convolutions
the
basal
ganglia
and
the
centers
of
the
special
senses
in
the
cortex
the
highest
level
bears
the
same
relation
to
the
middle
level
that
it
bears
to
the
lowest
no
continuous
connection
between
the
highest
and
the
lowest
is
assumed
the
structures
of
the
middle
level
mediate
between
them
as
a
system
of
relays
according
to
this
hierarchical
arrangement
of
the
nervous
system
the
lowest
level
which
is
the
simplest
and
oldest
contains
the
mechanism
for
the
simple
fundamental
movements
in
reflexes
and
involuntary
reactions
the
second
level
regroups
these
simple
movements
by
combinations
and
associations
of
cortical
structure
in
wider
more
complex
mechanisms
producing
a
higher
class
of
movements
the
highest
level
unifies
the
whole
nervous
system
and
according
to
jackson
is
the
anatomical
basis
of
mind

a
fuller
account

this
theory

industrial

imperative
for
every

in

not

because
of
the

because
of

decline

is

departments

places
this

the

is
due
to

the
incalculable
phyletic
reënforcement

years

not
only
in

in

has
many
features
of
an
ideal
educational
environment
for
adolescent
boys
combining
as
it
does
not
only
physical
and
industrial
but
civil
and
religious
elements
in
wise
proportions
and
with
pedagogic
objectivity
and
representing
the
ideal
of
such
a
state
of
intelligent
citizen
voters
as
was
contemplated
by
the
framers
of
our
constitution
contrast
this
life
with
that
of
a
hand
in
a
modern
shoe
factory
who
does
all
day
but
one
of
the
stages
or
processes
from
a
tanned
hide
to
a
finished
shoe
or
of
a
man
in
a
shirt
shop
who
is
one
of
each
of
whom
does
as
a
single
step
requiring
great
exactness
speed
and
skill
and
who
never
knows
how
a
whole
shirt
is
made
and
we
shall
see
that
the
present
beginning
of
a
revival
of
interest
in
muscular
development
comes
none
too
early
so
liberal
is
muscular
education
of
this
kind
that
its
work
in
somewhat
primitive
form
has
been
restored
and
copied
many
features
by
many
educational
institutions
for
adolescents
of
the
abbotsholme
type
and
grade
and
several
others
whose
purpose
is
to
train
for
primitive
conditions
of
colonial
life
thousands
of
school
gardens
have
also
been
lately
developed
for
lower
grades
which
have
given
a
new
impetus
to
the
study
of
nature
farm
training
at
its
best
instills
love
of
country
ruralizes
taste
borrows
some
of
its
ideals
from
pedagogic
province
and
perhaps
even
from
gilman
communities
with
villages
at
the
center
irradiating
to
farms
in
all
directions
in
england
where
by
the
law
of
primogeniture
holdings
are
large
and
in
few
hands
this
training
has
never
flourished
as
it
has
greatly
in
france
where
nearly
every
adult
male
may
own
land
and
a
large
proportion
will
come
to
do
so
so
of
processes
as
a
student
in
germany
i
took
a
few
lessons
each
of
a
bookbinder
a
glassblower
a
shoemaker
a
plumber
and
a
blacksmith
and
here
i
have
learned
in
a
crude
way
the
technique
of
the
and
none
of
which
come
amiss
in
the
laboratory
and
i
am
proud
that
i
can
still
mow
and
keep
my
scythe
sharp
chop
plow
milk
churn
make
cheese
and
soap
braid
a
hat
complete
knit
spin
and
even
put
in
a
piece
in
an
hand
loom
and
weave
frocking
but
thus
pride
bows
low
before
the
pupils
of
our
best
institutions
for
negroes
indians
and
juvenile
delinquents
whose
training
is
often
in
more
than
a
score
of
industries
and
who
in
my
judgment
receive
the
best
training
in
the
land
if
judged
by
the
annual
growth
in
mind
morals
health
physique
ability
and
knowledge
all
taken
together
instead
of
seeking
soft
places
near
home
such
education
impels
to
the
frontier
to
strike
out
new
careers
to
start
at
the
bottom
and
rise
by
merit
beginning
so
low
that
every
change
must
be
a
rise
wherever
youth
thus
trained
are
thrown
they
land
like
a
cat
on
and
are
armed
for
the
struggle
of
life
agriculture
manufacture
and
commerce
are
the
bases
of
national
prosperity
and
on
them
all
professions
institutions
and
even
culture
are
more
and
more
dependent
while
the
old
ideals
of
mere
study
and
are
fast
becoming
obsolete
we
really
retain
only
the
knowledge
we
apply
we
should
get
up
interest
in
new
processes
like
that
of
a
naturalist
in
new
species
those
who
leave
school
at
any
age
or
stage
should
be
best
fitted
to
take
up
their
life
work
instead
of
leaving
unfitted
for
it
aimless
and
discouraged
instead
of
dropping
out
limp
and
disheartened
we
should
train
in
daudet
phrase
and
that
betimes
so
that
the
young
come
back
to
it
not
too
late
for
securing
the
best
benefits
after
having
wasted
the
years
best
fitted
for
it
in
profitless
studies
or
in
the
hard
school
of
failure
by
such
methods
many
of
our
flabby
undeveloped
anemic
city
youth
would
be
regenerated
in
body
and
spirit
some
of
the
now
oldest
richest
and
most
famous
schools
of
the
world
were
at
first
established
by
charity
for
poor
boys
who
worked
their
way
and
such
institutions
have
an
future
no
others
so
well
fit
for
a
life
of
respectable
and
successful
muscle
work
and
perhaps
this
should
be
central
for
all
at
this
stage
this
diversity
of
training
develops
the
muscular
activities
rendered
necessary
by
man
early

which
were
so
largely
concerned

perhaps
dawson

right
in
thinking
that

physical
activities
in
the
past
have
gone

industry
has
determined
the

of
muscular

youth
who

are
most
truly
repeating
the
history
of

this
too

best

careers
the
study
of
pure
science
as
well
as
its
higher
technology
follows
rather
than
precedes
this
in
the
largest
sense
this
is
the
order
of
nature
from
fundamental
and
generalized
to
finer
accessory
and
specialized
organs
and
functions
and
such
a
sequence
best
weeds
out
and
subordinates
automatisms
the
age
of
stress
in
most
of
these
kinds
of
training
is
that
of
most
rapid
increment
of
muscular
power
as
we
have
seen
in
the
middle
and
later
teens
rather
than
childhood
as
some
recent
methods
have
mistakenly
assumed
and
this
prepolytechnic
work
wherever
and
in
whatever
degree
it
is
possible
is
a
better
adjunct
of
secondary
courses
than
manual
training
the
sad
fact
being
that
according
to
the
best
estimates
only
a

has

in

now
most

form
it
came
to
us
more
than
a

from

and
has
its
best
representation
here
in
our
new
and
often
magnificent
high
schools
and
in
many
courses
in
other
public
schools
this
work
meets
the
growing
demand
of
the
country
for
a
more
practical
education
a
demand
which
often
greatly
exceeds
the
accommodations
the
philosophy
if
such
it
may
be
called
that
underlies
the
movement
is
simple
forcible
and
sound
and
not
unlike

period
gives
a
sense
of
capacity
and
effectiveness
and
is
a
useful
preparation
for
a
number
of
vocations
these
claims
are
all
well
founded
and
this
work
is
a
valuable
addition
to
the
pedagogic
agencies
of
any
country
or
state
as
man
excels
the
higher
anthropoids
perhaps
almost
as
much
in
hand
power
as
in
mind
and
since
the
manual
areas
of
the
brain
are
wide
near
the
psychic
zones
and
the
cortical
centers
are
thus
directly
developed
the
hand
is
a
potent
instrument
in
opening
the
intellect
as
well
as
in
training
sense
and
will
it
is
no
reproach
to
these
schools
that
full
as
they
are
they
provide
for
but
an
insignificant
fraction
of
the
nearly
sixteen
millions
or
twenty
per
cent
of
the
young
people
of
the
country
between
fifteen
and
when
we
turn
to
the
needs
of
these
pupils
the
errors
and
limitations
of
the
method
are
painful
to
contemplate
the
work
is
essentially
manual
and
offers
little
for
the
legs
where
most
of
the
muscular
tissues
of
the
body
lie
those
which
respond
most
to
training
and
are
now
most
in
danger
of
degeneration
at
this
age
the
back
and
trunk
also
are
little
trained
consideration
of
proportion
and
bilateral
asymmetry
are
practically
ignored
almost
in
proportion
as
these
schools
have
multiplied
the
rage
for
uniformity
together
with
motives
of
economy
and
administrative
efficiency
on
account
of
overcrowding
have
made
them
rigid
and
inflexible
on
the
principle
that
as
the
line
lengthens
the
stake
must
be
strengthened
this
is
a
double
misfortune
for
the
courses
were
not
sufficiently
considered
at
first
and
the
plastic
stage
of
adaptation
was
too
short
while
the
methods
of
industry
have
undergone
vast
changes
since
they
were
given
shape
there
are
now
between
three
and
four
hundred
occupations
in
the
census
more
than
half
of
these
involving
manual
work
so
that
never
perhaps
was
there
so
great
a
pedagogic
problem
as
to
make
these
natural
developments
into
conscious
art
to
extract
what
may
be
called
basal
types
this
requires
an
effort
not
without
analogy
to
aristotle
attempt
to
extract
from
the
topics
of
the
marketplace
the
underlying
categories
eternally
conditioning
all
thought
or
to
construct
a
grammar
of
speech
hardly
an
attempt
worthy
the
name
not
even
the
very
inadequate
one
of
a
committee
has
been
made
in
this
field
to
study
the
conditions
and
to
meet
them
like
froebel
gifts
and
occupations
deemed
by
their
author
the
very
roots
of
human
occupations
in
infant
form
the
processes
selected
are
underived
and
find
their
justification
rather
in
their
logical
sequence
and
coherence
than
in
being
true
norms
of
work
if
these
latter
be
attainable
at
all
it
is
not
likely
that
they
will
fit
so
snugly
in
a
brief
curriculum
so
that
its
simplicity
is
suspicious
the
wards
of
the
keys
that
lock
the
secrets
of
nature
and
human
life
are
more
intricate
and
mazy
as
bailey
well
puts
it
in
substance
a
master
in
any
must
have
a
fourfold
equipment
ability
to
grasp
an
idea
and
embody
it
power
to
utilize
all
nerve
and
a
wide
repertory
of
methods
devices
recipes
discoveries
machines
etc
knowledge
of
the
history
of
the
craft
skill
in
technical
processes
american
schools
emphasize
chiefly
only
the
last
the
actual
result
is
thus
a
course
rich
in
details
representing
wood
and
iron
chiefly
and
mostly
ignoring
other
materials
the
part
of
the
course
treating
of
the
former
wooden
in
its
teachings
and
distinctly
tending
to
make
joiners
carpenters
and
that
of
the
latter
iron
in
its
rigidity
and
an
excellent
school
for
smiths
mechanics
and
machinists
these
courses
are
not
liberal
because
they
hardly
touch
science
which
is
rapidly
becoming
the
real
basis
of
every
industry
almost
nothing
that
can
be
called
scientific
knowledge
is
required
or
even
much
favored
save
some
geometrical
and
mechanical
drawing
and
its
implicates
these
schools
instinctively
fear
and
repudiate
plain
and
direct
utility
or
suspect
its
educational
value
or
repute
in
the
community
because
of
this
strong
bias
toward
a
few
trades
this
tendency
also
they
even
fear
less
often
because
unfortunately
in
this
country
sometimes
jealously
suspect
it
and
might
vote
down
supplies
than
because
the
teachers
in
these
schools
were
generally
trained
in
older
scholastic
and
even
classic
methods
and
matter
industry
is
everywhere
and
always
for
the
sake
of
the
product
and
to
cut
loose
from
this
as
if
it
were
a
contamination
is
a
fatal
mistake
to
focus
on
process
only
with
no
reference
to
the
object
made
is
here
an
almost
tragic
case
of
the
sacrifice
of
content
to
form
which
in
all
history
has
been
the
chief
stigma
of
degeneration
in
education
man
is
a
animal
but
tools
are
always
only
a
means
to
an
end
the
latter
prompting
even
their
invention
hence
a
course
in
tool
manipulation
only
with
persistent
refusal
to
consider
the
product
lest
features
of
be
introduced
has
made
most
of
our
high
schools
ghastly
hollow
artificial
institutions
instead
of
making
in
the
lower
grades
certain
toys
which
are
masterpieces
of
mechanical
simplification
as
tops
and
kites
and
introducing
such
processes
as
and
photography
and
in
higher
grades
making
simple
scientific
apparatus
more
generic
than
machines
to
open
the
great
principles
of
the
material
universe
all
is
sacrificed
to
supernormalized
method
as
in
all
hypermethodic
schemes
the
thought
side
is
feeble
there
is
no
control
of
the
work
of
these
schools
by
the
higher
technical
institutions
such
as
the
college
exercises
over
the
high
school
so
that
few
of
them
do
work
that
fits
for
advanced
training
or
is
thought
best
by
technical
faculties
in
most
of
its
current
narrow
forms
manual
training
will
prove
to
be
historically
as
it
is
educationally
extemporized
and
tentative
and
will
soon
be
superseded
by
broader
methods
and
be
forgotten
and
obsolete
or
cited
only
as
a
low
point
of
departure
from
which
future
progress
will
loom
up
indeed
in

progressive

sloyd
has
certain
special
features
and
claims
the
word
means
skilful
deft
the
movement
was
organised
in
sweden
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
as
an
effort
to
prevent
the
extinction
by
machinery
of
peasant
home
industry
during
the
long
winter
night
home
sloyd
was
installed
in
an
institution
of
its
own
for
training
teachers
at
nääs
it
works
in
wood
only
with
little
machinery
and
is
best
developed
for
children
of
from
eleven
to
fifteen
it
no
longer
aims
to
make
artisans
but
its
manipulations
are
meant
to
be
developmental
to
teach
both
sexes
not
only
to
be
useful
but
and
and
to
revere
exactness
as
a
form
of
truthfulness
it
assumes
that
all
and
especially
the
can
really
understand
only
what
they
make
and
that
one
can
work
like
a
peasant
and
think
like
a
philosopher
it
aims
to
produce
wholes
rather
than
parts
like
the
russian
system
and
to
be
so
essentially
educational
that
as
a
leading
exponent
says
its
best
effects
would
be
conserved
if
the
hands
were
cut
off
this
change
of
its
original
utilitarianism
from
the
lower
to
the
liberal
motor
development
of
the
middle
and
upper
classes
and
from
the
land
where
it
originated
to
another
has
not
eliminated
the
dominant
marks
of
its
origin
in
its
models
the
penates
of
the
sloyd
household
the
unique
features
of
which
persist
like
a
national
school
of
art
despite
transplantation
and
transformation
sloyd
at
its
best
tries
to
correlate
several
series
exercises
tools
drawing
and
models
each
must
be
progressive
so
that
every
new
step
in
each
series
involves
a
new
and
next
developmental
step
in
all
the
others
and
all
together
it
is
claimed
fit
the
order
and
degree
of
development
of
each
power
appealed
to
in
the
child
yet
there
has
been
hardly
an
attempt
to
justify
either
the
physiological
or
the
psychological
reason
of
a
single
step
in
any
of
these
series
and
the
coördination
of
the
series
even
with
each
other
to
say
nothing
of
their
adaptation
to
the
stages
of
the
child
development
this
if
as
pat
and
complete
as
is
urged
would
indeed
constitute
on
the
whole
a
paragon
of
all
the
harmony
beauty
totality
in
variety
which
make
it
so
magnificent
in
the
admirer
eyes
but
the
tools
exercises
models
of
which
are
joints
all
learned
by
teachers
in
one
school
year
of
daily
work
and
by
pupils
in
four
years
are
overmethodic
and
such
correlation
is
impossible
in
so
many
series
at
once
every
dual
order
even
of
work
and
unfoldment
of
powers
is
hard
enough
since
the
fall
lost
us
eden
and
woodwork
could
it
be
upon
that
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
itself
incompatible
with
enjoying
its
fruit
although
a
philosopher
may
see
the
whole
universe
in
its
smallest
part
all
his
theory
can
not
reproduce
educational
wholes
from
fragments
of
it
the
real
merits
of
sloyd
have
caused
its
enthusiastic
leaders
to
magnify
its
scope
and
claims
far
beyond
their
modest
bounds
and
although
its
field
covers
the
great
transition
from
childhood
to
youth
one
searches
in
vain
both
its
literature
and
practise
for
the
slightest
recognition
of
the
new
motives
and
methods
that
puberty
suggests
especially
in
its
partially
acclimatized
forms
to
american
conditions
it
is
all
adult
and
almost
scholastic
and
as
the
most
elaborate
machinery
may
sometimes
be
run
by
a
poor
if
the
stream
be
swift
and
copious
enough
so
the
mighty
rent
that
sets
toward
motor
education
would
give
it
some
degree
of
success
were
it
worse
and
less
economic
of
pedagogic
momentum
than
it
is
it
holds
singularly
aloof
from
other
methods
of
efferent
training
and
resists
coördination
with
them
and
its
provisions
for
other
than
hand
development
are
slight
it
will
be
one
of
the
last
to
accept
its
true
but
modest
place
as
contributing
certain
few
but
precious
elements
in
the
greater
synthesis
that
impends
indian
industries
basketry
pottery
bead
leather
bows
and
arrows
bark
which
our
civilization
is
making
lost
arts
by
forcing
the
white
man
industries
upon
red
men
at
reservation
schools
and
elsewhere
need
only
a
small
part
of
the
systemization
that
swedish
peasant
work
has
received
to
develop
even
greater
educational
values
and
the
same
is
true
of
the
indigenous
household
work
of
the
old
new
england
farm
the
real
worth
and
possibilities
of
which
are
only
now
and
perhaps
too
late
beginning
to
be
seen
by
a
few
educators
this
brings
us
to
the
arts
and
crafts
movement
originating
with
carlyle
gospel
of
work
and
ruskin
medievalism
developed
by
william
morris
and
his
disciples
at
the
red
house
checked
awhile
by
the
ridicule
of
the
comic
opera
patience
and
lately
revived
in
some
of
its
features
by
and
of
late
to
some
extent
in
various
centers
in
this
country
its
ideal
was
to
restore
the
day
of
the
seven
ancient
guilds
and
of
hans
sachs
the
poet
cobbler
when
conscience
and
beauty
inspired
work
and
the
hand
did
what
machines
only
imitate
and
vulgarize
in
the
past
which
this
school
of
motor
culture
harks
back
to
work
for
which
our
degenerate
age
lacks
even
respect
was
indeed
praise
refined
men
and
women
have
remembered
these
early
days
when
their
race
was
in
its
prime
as
a
lost
paradise
which
they
would
regain
by
designing
and
even
weaving
tapestries
and
muslins
experimenting
in
vats
with
dyes
to
rival
tyrian
purple
printing
and
binding
by
hand
books
that
surpass
the
best
of
the
aldine
and
elzevirs
carving
in
old
oak
hammering
brass
forging
locks
irons
and
candlesticks
becoming
artists
in
burned
wood
and
leather
seeking
old
effects
of
simplicity
and
solidity
in
furniture
and
decoration
as
well
as
architecture
stained
glass
and
to
some
extent
in

this

socialistic
state
where
the
artist
and
even
the
artisan
should
take
his
rightful
place
above
the
man
who
merely
knows
the
day
of
the
mere
professor
who
deals
in
knowledge
is
gone
and
the
day
of
the
doer
who
creates
has
come
the
brain
and
the
hand
too
long
divorced
and
each
weak
and
mean
without
the
other
use
and
beauty
each
alone
vulgar
letters
and
labor
each
soulless
without
the
other
are
henceforth
to
be
one
and
inseparable
and
this
union
will
lift
man
to
a
higher
level
the
workman
in
his
apron
and
paper
hat
inspired
by
the
new
socialism
and
the
old
spirit
of
chivalry
as
revived
by
scott
revering
wagner
revival
of
the
old
that
was
to
conquer
or
tennyson
arthurian
cycle
this
was
its
ideal
even
as
the
jews
rekindled
their
loyalty
to
the
ancient
traditions
of
their
race
and
made
their
bible
under
ezra
as
we
begin
to
revere
the
day
of
the
who
made
our
institutions
or
as
some
of
us
would
revive
his
vanishing
industrial
life
for
the
red
man
although
this
movement
was
by
older
men
and
women
and
had
in
it
something
of
the
longing
regret
of
senescence
for
days
that
are
no
more
it
shows
us
the
glory
which
invests
racial
adolescence
when
it
is
recalled
in
maturity
the
time
when
the
soul
can
best
appreciate
the
value
of
its
creations
and
its
possibilities
and
really
lives
again
in
its
glamour
and
finds
in
it
its
greatest
inspiration
hence
it
has
its
lessons
for
us
here
a
touch
but
not
too
much
of
it
should
be
felt
in
all
manual
education
which
is
just
as
capable
of
idealism
as
literary
education
this
gives
soul
interest
content
beauty
taste
if
not
a
polyphrastic
philosophy
seeking
to
dignify
the
occupation
of
the
workshop
by
a
pretentious
volapük
of
reasons
and
abstract
theories
we
have
here
the
pregnant
suggestion
of
a
psychological
quarry
of
motives
and
spirit
opened
and
ready
to
be
worked
thus
the
best
forces
from
the
past
should
be
turned
on
to
shape
and
reinforce
the
best
tendencies
of
the
present
the
writings
of
the
above
gospelers
of
work
not
only
could
and
should
but
will
be
used
to
inspire
high
schools
sloyd
and
even
some
of
the
less
scholastic
industrial
courses
but
each
is
incomplete
without
the
other
these
books
and
those
that
breathe
their
spirit
should
be
the
mental
workshop
of
all
who
do
tool
lathe
and
forge
work
who
design
and
draw
patterns
carve
or
mold
or
of
those
who
study
how
to
shape
matter
for
human
uses
and
whose
aim
is
to
obtain
diplomas
or
certificates
of
fitness
to
teach
all
such
things
the
muse
of
art
and
even
of
music
will
have
some
voice
in
the
great
synthesis
which
is
to
gather
up
the
scattered
hence
ineffective
elements
of
secondary
motor
training
in
forms
which
shall
represent
all
the
needs
of
adolescents
in
the
order
and
proportion
that
nature
and
growth
stages
indicate
drawing
with
this
end
supreme
upon
all
the
resources
that
history
and
reform
offer
to
our
selection
all
this
can
never
make
work
become
play
indeed
it
will
and
should
make
work
harder
and
more
unlike
play
and
of
another
genus
because
the
former
is
thus
given
its
own
proper
soul
and
leads
its
own
distinct
but
richer
and
more
abounding
life
i
must
not
close
this
section
without
brief
mention
of
two
important
studies
that
have
supplied
each
a
new
and
important
determination
concerning
laws
of
work
peculiar
to
adolescence
the
main
telegraphic
line
requires
a
speed
of
over
seventy
letters
per
minute
of
all
whom
they
will
employ
as
a
sending
rate
this
is
not
very
difficult
and
is
often
attained
after
two
months
practise
this
standard
for
a
receiving
rate
is
harder
and
later
and
inquiry
at
schools
where
it
is
taught
shows
that
about
per
cent
of
those
who
begin
the
study
fail
to
reach
this
speed
and
so
are
not
employed
bryan
and
harter
explained
the
rate
of
improvement
in
both
sending
and
receiving
with
results
represented
for
one
typical
subject
in
the
curve
on
the
following
page
from
the
first
sending
improves
most
rapidly
and
crosses
the
a
few
months
before
the
receiving
rate
which
may
fall
short
curves
and
represent
the
same
student
i
have
added
line
to
illustrate
the
who
fail
receiving
is
far
less
pleasant
than
sending
and
years
of
daily
practise
at
ordinary
rates
will
not
bring
a
man
to
his
maximum
rate
he
remains
on
the
low
plateau
with
no
progress
beyond
a
certain
point
if
forced
by
stress
of
work
danger
of
being
dropped
or
by
will
power
to
make
a
prolonged
and
intense
effort
he
breaks
through
his
hidebound
rate
and
permanently
attains
a
faster
pace
this
is
true
at
each
step
and
every
advance
seems
to
cost
even
more
intensive
effort
than
the
former
one
at
length
for
those
who
go
on
the
rate
of
receiving
which
is
a
more
complex
process
exceeds
that
of
sending
and
the
curves
of
the
above
figure
would
cross
if
prolonged
the
expert
receives
so
much
faster
than
he
sends
that
abbreviated
codes
are
used
and
he
may
take
eighty
to
words
a
minute
on
a
typewriter
in
correct
form
illustration
letters
per
minute
x
weeks
of
practice
the
motor
curve
seems
to
asymptotically
approach
a
perhaps
physiological
limit
which
the
receiving
curve
does
not
suggest
this
seems
a
special
case
of
a
general
though
not
yet
explained
law
in
learning
a
foreign
language
speaking
is
first
and
easiest
and
hearing
takes
a
late
but
often
sudden
start
to
independence
perhaps
this
holds
of
every
ability
to
bryan
this
suggests
as
a
hierarchy
of
habits
the
plateau
of
little
or
no
improvement
meaning
that
lower
order
habits
are
approaching
their
maximum
but
are
not
yet
automatic
enough
to
leave
the
attention
free
to
attack
higher
order
habits
the
second
ascent
from
drudgery
to
freedom
which
comes
through
automatism
is
often
as
sudden
as
the
first
ascent
one
stroke
of
attention
comes
to
do
what
once
took
many
to
attain
such
effective
speed
is
not
dependent
on
reaction
time
this
shooting
together
of
units
distinguishes
the
master
from
the
man
the
genius
from
the
hack
in
many
if
not
all
skills
where
expertness
is
sought
there
is
a
long
discouraging
level
and
then
for
the
best
a
sudden
ascent
as
if
here
too
as
we
have
reason
to
think
in
the
growth
of
both
the
body
as
a
whole
and
in
that
of
its
parts
nature
does
make
leaps
and
attains
her
ends
by
alternate
rests
and
rushes
youth
lives
along
on
a
low
level
of
interest
and
accomplishment
and
then
starts
onward
is
transformed
converted
the
hard
becomes
easy
the
old
life
sinks
to
a
lower
stratum
and
a
new
and
higher
order
perhaps
a
higher
brain
level
and
functions
is
evolved
the
practical
implication
here
of
the
necessity
of
hard
concentrative
effort
as
a
condition
of
advancement
is
by
a
quotation
from
senator
stanford
on
the
effect
of
early
and
rather
intensive
work
at
not
too
long
periods
in
training
colts
for
racing
are
especially
dangerous
he
says
it
is
the
supreme
effort
that
develops
this
i
may
add
suggests
what
is
developed
elsewhere
that
truly
spontaneous
attention
is
conditioned
by
spontaneous
muscle
tension
which
is
a
function
of
growth
and
that
muscles
are
thus
organs
of
the
mind
and
also
that
even
voluntary
attention
is
motivated
by
the
same
nisus
of
development
even
in
its
most
adult
form
and
that
the
products
of
science
invention
discovery
as
well
as
the
association
plexus
of
all
that
was
originally
determined
in
the
form
of
consciousness
are
made
by
rhythmic
alternation
of
attack
as
it
moves
from
point
to
point
creating
diversions
and
recurrence
the
other
study
although
quite
independent
is
part
a
special
application
and
illustration
of
the
same
principle
at
the
age
of
four
or
five
when
they
can
do
little
more
than
scribble
children
chief
interest
in
pictures
is
as
finished
products
but
in
the
second
period
which
lange
calls
that
of
artistic
illusion
the
child
sees
in
his
own
work
not
merely
what
it
represents
but
an
image
of
fancy
back
of
it
this
then
is
the
golden
period
for
the
development
of
power
to
create
artistically
the
child
loves
to
draw
everything
with
the
pleasure
chiefly
in
the
act
and
he
cares
little
for
the
finished
picture
he
draws
out
of
his
own
head
and
not
from
copy
before
his
eye
anything
and
everything
is
attempted
in
bold
lines
in
this
golden
age
of
drawing
if
he
followed
the
teacher
looked
carefully
and
drew
what
he
saw
he
would
be
abashed
at
his
production
indians
conflagrations
games
brownies
trains
pageants
battles
everything
is
graphically
portrayed
but
only
the
little
artist
himself
sees
the
full
meaning
of
his
lines
criticism
or
drawing
strictly
after
nature
breaks
this
charm
since
it
gives
place
to
mechanical
reproduction
in
which
the
child
has
little
interest
thus
awakens
him
from
his
dream
to
a
realization
that
he
can
not
draw
and
from
ten
to
fifteen
his
power
of
perceiving
things
steadily
increases
and
he
makes
almost
no
progress
in
drawing
adolescence
arouses
the
creative
faculty
and
the
desire
and
ability
to
draw
are
checked
and
decline
after
thirteen
or
fourteen
the
curve
is
the
plateau
which
barnes
has
described
the
child
has
measured
his
own
productions
upon
the
object
they
reproduced
and
found
them
wanting
is
discouraged
and
dislikes
drawing
from
twelve
on
barnes
found
drawing
more
and
more
distasteful
and
this
too
lukens
found
to
be
the
opinion
of
our
art
teachers
the
pupils
may
draw
very
properly
and
improve
in
technique
but
the
interest
is
gone
this
is
the
condition
in
which
most
men
remain
all
their
lives
their
power
to
appreciate
steadily
increases
only
a
few
gifted
adolescents
about
this
age
begin
a
to
develop
a
new
zest
in
production
rivaling
that
of
the
period
from
five
to
ten
when
their
satisfaction
is
again
chiefly
in
creation
these
are
the
artists
whose
active
powers
dominate
lukens
finds
in
his
studies
of
drawing
that
in
what
he
calls
his
fourth
period
of
artistic
development
there
are
those
who
during
adolescence
experience
a
rebirth
of
creative
power
zest
in
creation
then
often
becomes
a
stronger
incentive
to
work
than
any
pleasure
or
profit
to
be
derived
from
the
finished
product
so
that
in
this
the
propitious
conditions
of
the
first
golden
age
of
childhood
are
repeated
and
the
deepest
satisfaction
is
again
found
in
the
work
itself
at
about
fourteen
or
fifteen
which
is
the
transition
period
nascent
faculties
sometimes
develop
very
rapidly
lukens
draws
the
interesting
curve
shown
on
the
following
page
illustration
motor
creative
or
productive
power
sensory
or
receptive
interest
in
the
finished
product
the
reciprocity
between
the
power
to
produce
and
that
to
appreciate
roughly
represented
in
the
above
curve
likely
is
true
also
in
the
domain
of
music
and
may
be
perhaps
a
general
law
of
development
certain
it
is
that
the
adolescent
power
to
apperceive
and
appreciate
never
so
far
outstrips
his
power
to
produce
or
reproduce
as
about
midway
in
the
teens
now
impressions
sink
deepest
the
greatest
artists
are
usually
those
who
paint
later
when
the
expressive
powers
are
developed
what
they
have
felt
most
deeply
and
known
best
at
this
age
and
not
those
who
in
the
late
twenties
or
still
later
have
gone
to
new
environments
and
sought
to
depict
them
all
young
people
draw
best
those
objects
they
love
most
and
their
proficiency
should
be
some
test
of
the
contents
of
their
minds
they
must
put
their
own
consciousness
into
a
picture
at
the
dawn
of
this
stage
of
appreciation
the
esthetic
tastes
should
be
stimulated
by
exposure
to
and
instructed
in
feeling
for
the
of
masterpieces
and
instruction
in
technique
detail
criticism
and
learned
discrimination
of
schools
of
painting
should
be
given
intermittently
art
should
not
now
be
for
art
sake
but
for
the
sake
of
feeling
and
character
life
and
conduct
it
should
be
adjunct
to
morals
history
and
literature
and
in
all
edification
should
be
the
goal
and
personal
interest
and
not
that
of
the
teacher
should
be
the
guide
insistence
on
production
should
be
eased
and
the
receptive
imagination
now
so
hungry
should
be
fed
and
reinforced
by
story
and
all
other
accessories
by
such
a
curriculum
potential
creativeness
if
it
exists
will
surely
be
evoked
in
its
own
good
time
it
will
at
first
attempt
no
commonplace
themes
but
will
essay
the
highest
that
the
imagination
can
bode
forth
it
may
be
crude
and
lame
in
execution
but
it
will
be
lofty
perhaps
grand
and
if
it
is
original
in
consciousness
it
will
be
in
effect
most
creative
painters
before
twenty
have
grappled
with
the
greatest
scenes
in
literature
or
turning
points
in
history
representations
of
the
loftiest
truths
embodiments
of
the
most
inspiring
ideals
none
who
deserve
the
name
of
artist
copy
anything
now
and
least
of
all
with
objective
fidelity
to
nature
and
the
teacher
that
represses
or
criticizes
this
first
point
of
genius
or
who
can
not
pardon
the
grave
faults
of
technique
inevitable
at
this
age
when
ambition
ought
to
be
too
great
for
power
is
not
an
educator
but
a
repressor
a
pedagogic
philistine
committing
like
so
many
of
his
calling
in
other
fields
the
unpardonable
sin
against
budding
promise
always
at
this
age
so
easily
blighted
just
as
the
child
of
six
or
seven
should
be
encouraged
in
his
strong
instinct
to
draw
the
most
complex
scenes
of
his
daily
life
so
now
the
inner
life
should
find
graphic
utterance
in
all
its
intricacy
up
to
the
full
limit
of
unrepressed
courage
for
the
great
majority
on
the
other
hand
who
only
appreciate
and
will
never
create
the
mind
if
it
have
its
rights
will
be
stored
with
the
best
images
and
sentiments
of
art
for
at
this
time
they
are
best
remembered
and
sink
deepest
into
heart
and
life
now
although
the
hand
may
refuse
the
fancy
paints
the
world
in
brightest
hues
and
fairest
forms
and
such
an
opportunity
for
infecting
the
soul
with
vaccine
of
ideality
hope
optimism
and
courage
in
adversity
will
never
come
again
i
believe
that
in
few
departments
are
current
educational
theories
and
practises
so
hard
on
youth
of
superior
gifts
just
at
the
age
when
all
become
geniuses
for
a
season
very
brief
for
most
prolonged
for
some
and
permanent
for
the
best
we
do
not
know
how
to
teach
to
see
hear
and
feel
when
the
sense
centers
are
most
indelibly
impressible
and
to
give
relative
rest
to
the
hand
during
the
years
when
its
power
of
accuracy
is
abated
and
when
all
that
is
good
is
idealized
furthest
and
confidence
in
ability
to
produce
is
at
its
lowest
ebb
finally
our
divorce
between
industrial
and
manual
training
is
abnormal
and
higher
technical
education
is
the
chief
sufferer
professor
thurston
of
cornell
who
has
lately
returned
from
a
tour
of
inspection
abroad
reported
that
to
equal
germany
we
now
need
twenty
technical
universities
having
in
their
schools
of
engineering
instructors
and
students
each
two
thousand
technical
high
schools
or
schools
each
having
not
less
than
students
and
instructors
if
we
have
elementary
this
would
mean
technical
high
schools
enough
to
accommodate
students
served
by
teachers
with
the
strong
economic
arguments
in
this
direction
we
are
not
here
concerned
but
that
there
are
tendencies
to
unfit
youth
for
life
by
educational
method
and
matter
shown
in
strong
relief

this
standpoint

lamentable

the
great

a

can
effect
athletic
records
greek
physical
training
under
the
term
gymnastics
literally
naked
exercises
we
here
include
those
denuded
of
all
utilities
or
ulterior
ends
save
those
of
physical
culture
this
is
essentially
modern
and
was
unknown
in
antiquity
where
training
was
for
games
for
war
etc
several
ideals
underlie
this
movement
which
although
closely
related
are
distinct
and
as
yet
by
no
means
entirely
harmonized
these
may
be
described
as
follows
a
one
aim
of
jahn
more
developed
by
spiess
and
their
successors
was
to
do
everything
physically
possible
for
the
body
as
a
mechanism
many
postures
and
attitudes
are
assumed
and
many
movements
made
that
are
never
called
for
in
life
some
of
these
are
so
novel
that
a
great
variety
of
new
apparatus
had
to
be
devised
to
bring
them
out
and
jahn
invented
many
new
names
some
of
them
without
etymologies
to
designate
the
repertory
of
his
discoveries
and
inventions
that
extended
the
range
of
motor
life
common
movements
industries
and
even
games
train
only
a
limited
number
of
muscles
activities
and
coördinations
and
leave
more
or
less
unused
groups
and
combinations
so
that
many
latent
possibilities
slumber
and
powers
slowly
lapse
through
disuse
not
only
must
these
be
rescued
but
the
new
nascent
possibilities
of
modern
progressive
man
must
be
addressed
and
developed
even
the
common
things
that
the
average
untrained
youth
can
not
do
are
legion
and
each
of
these
should
be
a
new
incentive
to
the
trainer
as
he
realizes
how
very
far
below
their
motor
possibilities
meet
men
live
the
man
of
the
future
may
and
even
must
do
things
impossible
in
the
past
and
acquire
new
motor
variations
not
given
by
heredity
our
somatic
frame
and
its
powers
must
therefore
be
carefully
studied
inventoried
and
assessed
afresh
and
a
kind
and
amount
of
exercise
required
that
is
exactly
proportioned
not
perhaps
to
the
size
but
to
the
capability
of
each
voluntary
muscle
thus
only
can
we
have
a
truly
humanistic
physical
development
analogous
to
the
training
of
all
the
powers
of
the
mind
in
a
broad
truly
liberal
and
or
educational
curriculum
the
body
will
thus
have
its
rightful
share
in
the
pedagogic
traditions
and
inspirations
of
the
renaissance
thus
only
can
we
have
a
true
scale
of
standardised
culture
values
for
efferent
processes
and
from
this
we
can
measure
the
degrees
of
departure
both
in
the
direction
of
excess
and
defect
of
each
form
of
work
motor
habit
and
even
play
many
modern
epigoni
in
the
wake
of
this
great
ideal
where
its
momentum
was
early
spent
feeling
that
new
activities
might
be
discovered
with
virtues
hitherto
undreamed
of
have
almost
made
fetiches
of
special
disciplines
both
developmental
and
corrective
that
are
pictured
and
landed
in
scores
of
manuals
others
have
had
expectations
no
less
excessive
in
the
opposite
direction
and
have
argued
that
the
greatest
possible
variety
of
movements
best
developed
the
greatest
total
of
motor
energy
jahn
especially
thus
made
gymnastics
a
special
art
and
inspired
great
enthusiasm
of
humanity
and
the
songs
of
his
pupils
were
of
a
better
race
of
man
and
a
greater
and
united
fatherland
it
was
this
feature
that
made
his
work
unique
in
the
world
and
his
disciples
are
fond
of
reminding
us
of
the
fact
that
it
was
just
about
one
generation
of
men
after
the
acme
of
influence
of
his
system
that
in
germany
showed
herself
the
greatest
military
power
since
ancient
rome
and
took
the
acknowledged
leadership
of
the
world
both
in
education
and
science
these
theorizations
even
in
their
extreme
forms
have
been
not
only
highly
suggestive
but
have
brought
great
and
new
enthusiasms
and
ideals
into
the
educational
world
that
admirably
fit
adolescence
the
motive
of
bringing
out
latent
decaying
or
even
new
powers
skills
knacks
and
feats
is
full
of
inspiration
patriotism
is
aroused
for
thus
the
country
can
be
better
served
thus
the
german
fatherland
was
to
be
restored
and
unified
after
the
dark
days
that
followed
the
humiliation
of
jena
now
the
ideals
of
religion
are
invoked
that
the
soul
may
have
a
better
and
regenerated
somatic
organism
with
which
to
serve
jesus
and
the
church
exercise
is
made
a
form
of
praise
to
god
and
of
service
to
man
and
these
motives
are
reënforced
by
those
of
the
new
hygiene
which
strives
for
a
new
and
would
purify
the
body
as
the
temple
of
the
holy
ghost
thus
in
young
christian
association
training
schools
and
gymnasiums
the
gospel
of
christianity
is
preached
anew
and
seeks
to
bring
salvation
to
physical
frame
which
the
still
lingering
effects
of
asceticism
have
caused
to
be
too
long
neglected
in
its
progressive
degeneration
as
the
greek
games
were
in
honor
of
the
gods
so
now
the
body
is
trained
to
better
glorify
god
and
regimen
chastity
and
temperance
are
given
a
new
momentum
the
physical
salvation
thus
wrought
will
be
when
adequately
written
one
of
the
most
splendid
chapters
in
the
modern
history
of
christianity
military
ideals
have
been
revived
in
cult
and
song
to
hearten
the
warfare
against
evil
within
and
without
strength
is
prayed
for
as
well
as
worked
for
and
consecrated
to
the
highest
uses
last
but
not
least
power
thus
developed
over
a
large
surface
may
be
applied
to
athletic
contests
in
the
field
and
victories
here
are
valuable
as
of
how
sweet
the
glory
of
achievements
in
higher
moral
and
spiritual
tasks
will
taste
later
the
dangers
and
sources
of
error
in
this
ideal
of
training
are
alas
only
too
obvious
although
they
only
qualify
its
paramount
good
first
it
is
impossible
thus
to
measure
the
quanta
of
training
needed
so
as
rightly
to
assign
to
each
its
modicum
and
best
modality
of
training
indeed
no
method
of
doing
this
has
ever
been
attempted
but
the
assessments
have
been
arbitrary
and
conjectural
probably
right
in
some
and
wrong
in
other
respects
with
no
adequate
criterion
or
test
for
either
save
only
empirical
experience
secondly
heredity
which
lays
its
heavy
ictus
upon
some
neglected
forms
of
activity
and
fails
of
all
support
for
others
has
been
ignored
as
we
shall
see
later
one
of
the
best
norms
here
is
phyletic
emphasis
and
what
lacks
this
must
at
best
be
feeble
and
if
new
powers
are
unfolding
their
growth
must
be
very
slow
and
they
must
be
nurtured
as
tender
buds
for
generations
thirdly
too
little
regard
is
had
for
the
vast
differences
in
individuals
most
of
whom
need
much
personal
prescription
b
in
practise
the
above
ideal
is
never
isolated
from
others
perhaps
the
most
closely
associated
with
it
is
that
of
increased
volitional
control
man
is
largely
a
creature
of
habit
and
many
of
his
activities
are
more
or
less
automatic
reflexes
from
the
stimuli
of
his
environment
every
new
power
of
controlling
these
by
the
will
frees
man
from
slavery
and
widens
the
field
of
freedom
to
acquire
the
power
of
doing
all
with
consciousness
and
volition
mentalizes
the
body
gives
control
over
to
higher
brain
levels
and
develops
them
by
rescuing
activities
from
the
dominance
of
lower
centers
thus
agitat

mind
rules
the
body
this
end
is
favored
by
the
swedish
exercises
which
require
great
alertness
of
attention
to
translate
instantly
a
verbal
order
into
an
act
and
also
although
in
somewhat
less
degree
by
quick
imitation
of
a
leader
the
stimulus
of
music
and
rhythm
are
excluded
because
thought
to
interfere
with
this
end
a
somewhat
sophisticated
form
of
this
goal
is
sought
by
several
delsartian
schemes
of
relaxation
decomposition
and
recomposition
of
movements
to
do
all
things
with
consciousness
and
to
encroach
on
the
field
of
instinct
involves
new
and
more
vivid
sense
impressions
the
range
of
which
is
increased
directly
as
that
of
motion
the
more
closely
it
approaches
the
focus
of
attention
by
thus
analyzing
settled
and
established
coördinations
their
elements
are
set
free
and
may
be
organized
into
new
combinations
so
that
the
former
is
the
first
stage
toward
becoming
a
virtuoso
with
new
special
skills
this
is
the
road
to
inner
secrets
or
intellectual
rules
of
professional
and
expert
successes
such
as
older
athletes
often
rely
upon
when
their
strength
begins
to
wane
every
untrained
automatism
must
be
domesticated
and
every
striated
muscle
capable
of
direct
muscular
control
must
be
dominated
by
volition
thus
tensions
and
incipient
contractures
that
drain
off

can
be
relaxed

these
altogether
would
mark
the
extremes
in
this
direction
this
too
has
its
inspiration
for
youth
to
be
a
universal
adept
like
hippias
suggests
diderot
and
the
encyclopedists
in
the
intellectual
realm
to
do
all
with
consciousness
is
a
means
to
both
remedial
and
expert
ends
motor
life
often
needs
to
be
made
over
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
and
that
possibilities
of
vastly
greater
accomplishments
exist
than
are
at
present
realized
is
undoubted
even
in
manners
and
morals
which
are
both
at
root
only
motor
habits
indeed
consciousness
itself
is
largely
and
perhaps
wholly
corrective
in
its
very
essence
and
origin
thus
life
is
adjusted
to
new
environments
and
if
the
platonic
postulate
be
correct
that
untaught
virtues
that
come
by
nature
and
instinct
are
no
virtues
but
must
be
made
products
of
reflection
and
reason
the
sphere
and
need
of
this
principle
is
great
indeed
but
this
implies
a
distrust
of
physical
human
nature
as
and
radical
as
that
of
calvinism
for
the
unregenerate
heart
against
which
modern
common
sense
so
often
the
best
muse
of
both
psychophysics
and
pedagogy
protests
individual
prescription
is
here
as
imperative
as
it
is
difficult
wonders
that
now
seem
to
be
most
incredible
both
of
hurt
and
help
can
undoubtedly
be
wrought
but
analysis
should
always
be
for
the
sake
of
synthesis
and
never
be
beyond
its
need
and
assured
completion
no
thoughtful
student
fully
informed
of
the
facts
and
tentatives
in
this
field
can
doubt
that
here
lies
one
of
the
most
promising
fields
of
future
development
full
of
and
rich
results
for
those
as
yet
far
too
few
experts
in
physical
training
who
have
philosophic
minds
command
the
facts
of
modern
psychology
and
whom
the
world
awaits
now
as
never
before
another
yet
closely
correlated
ideal
is
that
of
economic
postures
and
movements
the
system
of
ling
is
less
orthopedic
than
orthogenic
although
he
sought
primarily
to
correct
bad
attitudes
and
perverted
growth
starting
from
the
respiratory
and
proceeding
to
the
muscular
system
he
and
his
immediate
pupils
were
content
to
refer
to
the
bodies
of
most
men
about
them
one
of
their
important
aims
was
to
relax
the
flexor
and
tone
up
the
extensor
muscles
and
to
open
the
human
form
into
postures
as
opposite
as
possible
to
those
of
the
embryo
which
it
tends
so
persistently
to
approximate
in
sitting
and
in
fatigue
and
collapse
attitudes
generally
the
head
must
balance
on
the
cervical
vertebra
and
not
call
upon
the
muscles
of
the
neck
to
keep
it
from
rolling
off
the
weight
of
the
shoulders
must
be
thrown
back
off
the
thorax
the
spine
be
erect
to
allow
the
abdomen
free
action
the
joints
of
the
thigh
extended
the
hand
and
arm
supinated
etc
bones
must
relieve
muscles
and
nerves
thus
an
erect
carriage
must
be
given
and
the
unfortunate
association
so
difficult
to
overcome
between
effort
and
an
involuted
posture
must
be
broken
up
this
means
economy
and
a
great
saving
of
vital
energy
extensor
action
goes
with
expansive
flexor
with
depressive
states
of
mind
hence
courage
buoyancy
hope
are
favored
and
handicaps
removed
all
that
is
done
with
great
effort
causes
wide
irradiation
of
tensions
to
the
other
half
of
the
body
and
also
sympathetic
activities
in
those
not
involved
the
law
of
maximal
ease
and
minimal
expenditure
of
energy
must
be
always
striven
for
and
the
interests
of
the
viscera
never
lost
sight
of
this
involves
educating
weak
and
neglected
muscles
and
like
the
next
ideal
often
shades
over
by
almost
imperceptible
gradation
into
the
passive
movements
by
the
zander
machines
realizing
that
certain
activities
are
sufficiently
or
too
much
emphasized
in
ordinary
life
stress
is
laid
upon
those
which
are
complemental
to
them
so
that
there
is
no
pretense
of
taking
charge
of
the
totality
of
motor
processes
the
intention
being
principally
to
supplement
deficiencies
to
insure
men
against
being
warped
distorted
or
deformed
by
their
work
in
life
to
compensate
specialties
and
perform
more
exactly
what
recreation
to
some
extent
aims
at
this
wholesome
but
less
inspiring
endeavor
which
combats
one
of
the
greatest
evils
that
under
modern
civilization
threatens
man
physical
weal
is
in
some
respects
as
easy
and
practical
as
it
is
useful
the
great
majority
of
city
bred
men
as
well
as
all
students
are
prone
to
deleterious
effects
from
too
much
sitting
and
indeed
there
is
anatomical
evidence
in
the
structure
of
the
tissues
and
especially
the
of
the
groins
that
at
his
best
man
is
not
yet
entirely
adjusted
to
the
upright
position
so
a
method
that
straightens
knees
hips
spine
and
shoulders
or
combats
the
attitude
is
a
most
salutary
contribution
to
a
great
and
growing
need
in
the
very
act
of
stretching
and
perhaps
yawning
for
which
much
is
to
be
said
nature
itself
suggests
such
correctives
and
preventives
to
save
men
from
being
victims
of
their
occupations
is
often
to
add
a
better
and
larger
half
to
their
motor
development
the
danger
of
the
system
which
now
best
represents
this
ideal
is
inflexibility
and
overscholastic
treatment
it
needs
a
great
range
of
individual
variations
if
it
would
do
more
than
increase
circulation
respiration
and
health
or
the
normal
functions
of
internal
organs
and
fundamental
physiological
activities
to
clothe
the
frame
with
honest
muscles
that
are
faithful
servants
of
the
will
adds
not
only
strength
more
active
habits
and
efficiency
but
health
and
in
its
material
installation
this
system
is
financially
economic
personal
faults
and
shortcomings
are
constantly
pointed
out
where
this
work
is
best
represented
and
it
has
a
distinct
advantage
in
inciting
an
acquaintance
with
physiology
and
inviting
the
larger
fields
of
medical
knowledge
the
fourth
gymnastic
aim
is
symmetry
and
correct
proportions
anthropometry
and
average
girths
and
dimensions
strength
of
the
parts
of
the
body
are
first
charted
in
percentile
grades
and
each
individual
is
referred
to
the
apparatus
and
exercises
best
fitted
to
correct
weaknesses
and
subnormalities
the
norms
here
followed
are
not
the
canons
of
greek
art
but
those
established
by
the
measurement
of
the
largest
numbers
properly
grouped
by
age
weight
height
etc
young
men
are
found
to
differ
very
widely
some
can
lift
pounds
and
some
not
some
can
lift
their
weight
between
twenty
and
forty
times
and
some
not
once
some
are
most
deficient
in
legs
others
in
shoulders
arms
backs
chests
by
photography
tape
and
scales
each
is
interested
in
his
own
bodily
condition
and
incited
to
overcome
his
greatest
defects
and
those
best
endowed
by
nature
to
attain
ideal
dimensions
and
make
new
records
are
encouraged
along
these
lines
thus
this
ideal
is
also
largely
though
not
exclusively
remedial
this
system
can
arouse
youth
to
the
greatest
pitch
of
zest
in
watching
their
own
rapidly
multiplying
curves
of
growth
in
dimensions
and
capacities
in
plotting
curves
that
record
their
own
increment
in
girths
lifts
and
other
tests
and
in
observing
the
effects
of
sleep
food
correct
and
incorrect
living
upon
a
system
so
exquisitely
responsive
to
all
these
influences
as
are
the
muscles
to
learn
to
know
and
grade
excellence
and
defect
to
be
known
for
the
list
of
things
one
can
do
and
to
have
a
record
or
to
realize
what
we
lack
of
power
to
break
best
records
even
to
know
that
we
are
strengthening
some
point
where
heredity
has
left
us
with
some
shortage
and
perhaps
danger
the
realization
of
all
this
may
bring
the
first
real
and
deep
feeling
for
growth
that
may
become
a
passion
later
in
things
of
the
soul
growth
always
has
its
selfish
aspects
and
to
be
constantly
passing
our
own
examination
in
this
respect
is
a
new
and
perhaps
sometimes
too
endeavor
of
our
young
college
barbarians
but
it
is
on
the
whole
a
healthful
regulative
and
this
form
of
the
struggle
toward
perfection
and
escape
from
the
handicap
of
birth
will
later
move
upward
to
the
intellectual
and
moral
plane
to
kindle
a
sense
of
physical
beauty
of
form
in
every
part
such
as
a
sculptor
has
may
be
to
start
youth
on
the
lowest
round
of
the
platonic
ladder
that
leads
up
to
the
vision
of
ideal
beauty
of
soul
if
his
ideal
be
not
excess
of
brawn
or
mere
brute
strength
but
the
true
proportion
represented
by
the
classic
or
mean
temperance
balanced
like
justice
between
all
extremes
hard
patient
regular
work
with
the
right
dosage
for
this
end
has
thus
at
the
same
time
a
unique
moral
effect
the
dangers
of
this
system
are
also
obvious
nature
intent
can
not
be
too
far
thwarted
and
as
in
mental
training
the
question
is
always
pertinent
so
here
we
may
ask
whether
it
be
not
best
in
all
cases
to
some
extent
and
in
some
cases
almost
exclusively
to
develop
in
the
direction
in
which
we
most
excel
to
emphasize
physical
individuality
and
even
idiosyncrasy
rather
than
to
strive
for
monotonous
uniformity
weaknesses
and
parts
that
lag
behind
are
the
most
easily
overworked
to
the
point
of
reaction
and
perhaps
permanent
injury
again
work
for
curative
purposes
lacks
the
exuberance
of
free
sports
it
is
not
inspiring
to
make
up
areas
and
therapeutic
exercises
imposed
like
a
sentence
for
the
shortcomings
of
our
forebears
bring
a
whiff
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
hospital
if
not
of
the
prison
into
the
gymnasium
these
four
ideals
while
so
closely
interrelated
are
as
yet
far
from
harmonized
swedish
turner
sargent
and
american
systems
are
each
most
unfortunately
still
too
blind
to
the
others
merits
and
too
conscious
of
the
others
shortcomings
to
some
extent
they
are
prevented
from
getting
together
by
narrow
devotion
to
a
single
cult
aided
sometimes
by
a
pecuniary
interest
in
the
sale
of
their
own
apparatus
and
books
or
in
the
training
of
teachers
according
to
one
set
of
rubrics
the
real
elephant
is
neither
a
fan
a
rope
a
tree
nor
a
log
as
the
blind
men
in
the
fable
contended
each
thinking
the
part
he
had
touched
to
be
the
whole
this
inability
of
leaders
to
combine
causes
uncertainty
and
lack
of
confidence
in
and
of
enthusiastic
support
for
any
system
on
the
part
of
the
public
even
the
radically
different
needs
of
the
sexes
have
failed
of
recognition
from
the
same
partisanship
all
together
represent
only
a
fraction
of
the
nature
and
needs
of
youth
the
world
now
demands
what
this
country
has
never
had
a
man
who
knowing
the
human
body
gymnastic
history
and
the
various
great
athletic
traditions
of
the
past
shall
study
anew
the
whole
motor
field
as
a
few
great
leaders
early
in
the
last
century
tried
to
do
who
shall
gather
and
correlate
the
literature
and
experiences
of
the
past
and
present
with
a
deep
sense
of
responsibility
to
the
future
who
shall
examine
martial
training
with
all
the
inspirations
warnings
and
new
demands
and
who
shall
know
how
to
revive
the
inspiration
of
the
past
animated
by
the
same
spirit
as
the
turners
who
were
almost
inflamed
by
referring
back
to
the
hardy
life
of
the
early
teutons
and
trying
to
reproduce
its
best
features
who
shall
catch
the
spirit
of
and
make
due
connections
with
popular
sports
past
and
present
study
both
industry
and
education
to
compensate
their
debilitating
effects
and
be
himself
animated
by
a
great
ethical
and
humanistic
hope
and
faith
in
a
better
future
such
a
man
if
he
ever
walks
the
earth
will
be
the
idol
of
youth
will
know
their
physical
secrets
will
come
almost
as
a
savior
to
the
bodies
of
men
and
will
like
jahn
feel
his
calling
and
work
sacred
and
his
institution
a
temple
in
which
every
physical
act
will
be
for
the
sake
of
the
soul
the
world
of
adolescence
especially
that
part
which
sits
in
closed
spaces
conning
books
groans
and
travails
all
the
more
grievously
and
yearningly
because
unconsciously
waiting
for
a
redeemer
for
its
body
till
he
appears
our
culture
must
remain
for
most
a
little
hollow
falsetto
and
handicapped
by
diseases
the
modern
gymnasium
performs
its
chief
service
during
adolescence
and
is
one
of
the
most
beneficent
agencies
of
which
not
a
few
but
every
youth
should
make
large
use
its
spirit
should
be
instinct
with
euphoria
where
the
joy
of
being
alive
reaches
a
point
of
high
although
not
quite
its
highest
intensity
while
the
stimulus
of
rivalry
and
even
of
records
is
not
excluded
and
social
feelings
may
be
appealed
to
by
unison
exercises
and
by
the
club
spirit
and
while
competitions
tournaments
and
the
artificial
motives
of
prizes
and
exhibitions
may
be
invoked
the
culture
is
in
fact
largely
individual
and
yet
in
this
country
the
annual
brings
or
men
from
all
parts
of
the
union
who
sometimes
all
deploy
and
go
through
some
of
the
standard
exercises
together
under
one
leader
instead
of
training
a
few
athletes
the
real
problem
now
presented
is
how
to
raise
the
general
level
of
vitality
so
that
children
and
youth
may
be
fitted
to
stand
the
strain
of
modern
civilization
resist
zymotic
diseases
and
overcome
the
deleterious
influences
of
city
life
the
almost
immediate
effects
of
systematic
training
are
surprising
and
would
hardly
be
inferred
from
the
annual
increments
tabled
earlier
in
this
chapter
sandow
was
a
rather
weakly
boy
and
ascribes
his
development
chiefly
to
systematic
training
we
have
space
but
for
two
reports
believed
to
be
typical
enebuske
reports
on
the
effects
of
seven
months
training
on
young
women
averaging
years
the
figures
are
based
on
the
percentile
column
strength
of
legs
before
training
after
six
by
comparing
records
of
what
he
deems
standard
normal
growth
with
that
of
naval
cadets
from
sixteen
to
who
had
special
and
systematic
training
just
after
the
period
of
most
rapid
growth
in
height
beyer
concluded
that
the
effect
of
four
years
of
this
added
a
little
over
an
inch
of
stature
and
that
this
gain
as
greatest
at
the
beginning
this
increase
was
greatest
for
the
youngest
cadets
he
found
also
a
marked
increase
in
weight
nearly
the
same
for
each
year
from
seventeen
to
twenty
one
this
he
thought
more
easily
influenced
by
exercise
than
height
a
high
vital
index
ratio
of
lung
capacity
to
weight
is
a
very
important
attribute
of
good
training
beyer
found
however
that
the
addition
of
lung
area
gained
by
exercise
did
not
keep
up
with
the
increase
thus
caused
in
muscular
substance
and
that
the
vital
index
always
became
smaller
in
those
who
had
gained
weight
and
strength
by
special
physical
training
how
much
gain
in
weight
is
desirable
beyond
the
point
where
the
lung
capacity
increases
at
an
equal
rate
is
unknown
if
such
measurements
were
applied
to
the
different
gymnastic
systems
we
might
be
able
to
compare
their
efficiency
which
would
be
a
great
desideratum
in
view
of
the
unfortunate
rivalry
between
them
total
strength
too
can
be
greatly
increased
beyer
thinks
that
from
sixteen
to
it
may
exceed
the
average
or
normal
increment
fivefold
and
he
adds
i
firmly
believe
that
the
now
so
wonderful
performances
of
most
of
our
strong
men
are
well
within
the
reach
of
the
majority
of
healthy
men
if
such
performances
were
a
serious
enough
part
of
their
ambition
to
make
them
do
the
exercises
necessary
to
develop
them
power
of
the
organs
to
respond
to
good
training
by
increased
strength
probably
reaches
well
into
middle
life
it
is
not
encouraging
to
learn
that
according
to
a
recent
writer
we
now
have
seventy
times
as
many
physicians
in
proportion
to
the
general
population
as
there
are
physical
directors
even
for
the
school
population
alone
considered
we
have
twice
as
many
physicians
per
population
as
great
britain
four
times
a
many
as
germany
or
physicians
ministers
lawyers
per
thousand
of
the
general
population
while
even
if
all
male
teachers
of
physical
training
taught
only
males
of
the
military
age
we
should
have
but
of
a
teacher
per
thousand
or
if
the
school
population
alone
be
considered
teachers
per
million
pupils
hence
it
is
inferred
that
the
need
of
wise
and
classified
teachers
in
this
field
is
at
present
greater
than
in
any
other
but
fortunately
while
spontaneous
unsystematic
exercise
in
a
modern
gymnasium
may
in
rare
cases
do
harm
so
far
from
sharing
the
prejudice
often
felt
for
it
by
professional
trainers
we
believe
that
free
access
to
it
without
control
or
direction
is
unquestionably
a
boon
to
youth
even
if
its
use
be
sporadic
and
occasional
as
it
is
likely
to
be
with
equal
opportunity
for
exercises
and
especially
sports
practise
is
sometimes
hygienic
almost
inversely
to
its
amount
while
even
lameness
from
initial
excess
has
its
lessons
and
the
sense
of
manifoldness
of
inferiorities
brought
home
by
experiences
gives
a
wholesome
and
stimulus
in
this
country
more
than
elsewhere
especially
in
high
school
and
college
gymnasium
work
has
been
brought
into
healthful
connection
with
field
sports
and
record
competitions
for
both
teams
and
individuals
who
aspire
to
championship
this
has
given
the
former
a
healthful
stimulus
although
it
is
felt
only
by
a
picked
few
scores
of
records
have
been
established
for
running
walking
hurdling
throwing
putting
swimming
rowing
skating
each
for
various
shorter
and
longer
distances
and
under
manifold
conditions
and
for
both
amateurs
and
professionals
who
are
easily
accessible
these
in
general
show
a
slow
but
steady
advance
in
this
country
since
when
athletics
were
established
here
in
that
year
there
was
not
a
single
world
best
record
held
by
an
american
amateur
and
boys
of
could
in
most
though
not
in
all
lines
have
won
the
american
championship
years
ago
of
course
in
a
strict
sense
intercollegiate
contests
do
not
show
the
real
advance
in
athletics
because
it
is
not
necessary
for
a
man
in
order
to
win
a
championship
to
do
his
best
but
they
do
show
general
improvement
we
select
for
our
purpose
a
few
of
those
records
longest
kept
not
dependent
on
external
conditions
like
or
on
improved
apparatus
like
bicycling
we
have
interesting
data
of
a
very
different
order
for
physical
measurements
these
down
to
present
writing
july
are
as
follows
for
the
dash
every
annual
record
from
to
is
or

or
between
these
save
in
where
owen
record
of

still
stands
in
the
run
there
is
slight
improvement
since
but
here
the
record
of
wefers
seconds
has
not
been
surpassed
in
the
run
the
beet
record
was
in
long
seconds
the
record
which
still
stands
was
made
in
kilpatrick
minute
seconds
the
mile
run
in
conneff
minutes

the
running
broad

shows
a
very
steady
improvement
with
the
best
record
in
prinstein
feet
inches
the
running
high

shows
improvement
but
less
with
the

of

the

we
also
find
that
if
we
extend
our
purview
to
include
all
kinds
of
records
for
physical
achievement
that
not
a
few
of
the
amateur
records
for
activities
involving

combined
with
rapid
rhythm
movement
are
held
by
young
men
of

or
even
less
in
putting

under
uniform

the
record
has
improved
since
the
early

nearly
feet
coe

at
present
writing
pole
vaulting
shows
a
very
marked
advance
culminating
in
dole
feet
inches
most
marked
of
all
perhaps
is
the
great
advance
in
throwing
the
hammer
beginning
between

feet
in
the
early
years
the
record
is
now
feet
inches
flanagan
the
bicycle
race
also
shows
marked
gain
partly
of
course
due
to
improvement
in
the
wheel
the
early
records
being
nearly
minutes
and
the
best
being
minutes
seconds
mclean
some
of
these
are
world
records
and
more
exceed
professional
records
these
of
course
no
more
indicate
general
improvement
than
the
steady
reduction
of
time
in
suggests
betterment
in
horses
generally
in
panhellenic
games
as
well
as
at
present
athleticism
in
its
manifold
forms
was
one
of
the
most
characteristic
expressions
of
adolescent
nature
and
needs
not
a
single
time
or
distance
record
of
antiquity
has
been
preserved
although
grasberger
and
other
writers
would
have
us
believe
that
in
those
that
are
comparable
ancient
youthful
champions
greatly
excelled
ours
especially
in
leaping
and
running
while
we
are
far
from
cultivating
mere
strength
our
training
is
very
from
the
greek
norm
of
unity
or
of
the
ideals
that
develop
the
body
only
for
the
salve
of
the
soul
while
gymnastics
in
our
sense
with
apparatus
exercises
and
measurements
independently
of
games
was
unknown
the
ideal
and
motive
were
as
different
from
ours
as
was
its
method
nothing
so
far
as
is
known
was
done
for
correcting
the
ravages
of
work
or
for
overcoming
hereditary
defects
and
until
athletics
degenerated
there
were
do
exercises
for
the
sole
purpose
of
developing
muscle
on
the
whole
while
modern
gymnastics
has
done
more
for
the
trunk
shoulders
and
arms
than
for
the
legs
it
is
now
too
selfish
and
deficient
on
the
side
of
psychic
impulsion
and
but
little
subordinated
to
ethical
or
intellectual
development
yet
it
does
a
great
physical
service
to
all
who
cultivate
it
and
is
a
safeguard
of
virtue
and
temperance
its
need
is
radical
revision
and
coordination
of
various
cults
and
theories
in
the
light
of
the
latest
science
gymnastics
allies
itself
to
biometric
work
the
present
academic
zeal
for
physical
development
is
in
great
need
of
closer
affiliation
with
anthropometry
this
important
and
growing
department
will
be
represented
in
the
ideal
gymnasium
of
the
future
first
by
courses
if
not
by
a
chair
devoted
to
the
apparatus
of
measurements
of
human
proportions
and
symmetry
with
a
kinesological
cabinet
where
young
men
are
instructed
in
the
elements
of
auscultation
the
use
of
calipers
the
sphygmograph
spirometer
plethysmograph
kinesometer
to

compute
average

and
tables
of

grades
and
in
statistical

etc
second
anatomy
especially
of
muscles
bones
heart

will
be

with

upon

the

on

all
on
the
basis
of

who
it
is
sufficient
to
remember
died
in
before

full
of
interest
and
has
a
very
high
and
not
yet
developed
culture
value
for
youth
this
department
both
in
its
practical
and
theoretical
side
should
have
its
full
share
of
prizes
and
scholarships
to
stimulate
the
seventy
to
per
cent
of
students
who
are
now
unaffected
by
the
influence
of
athletics
by
these
methods
the
motivation
of
gymnastics
which
now
in
large
measure
goes
to
waste
in
enthusiasm
could
be
utilised
to
aid
the
greatly
needed
intellectualization
of
those
exercises
which
in
their
nature
are
more
akin
to
work
than
play
indeed
gutsmuths
first
definition
of
athletics
was
work
under
the
garb
of
youthful
pleasure
so
to
develop
these
courses
that
they
could
chiefly
if
not
entirely
satisfy
the
requirements
for
the
degree
would
coordinate
the
work
of
the
now
isolated
curriculum
of
the
with
that
of
the
college
and
thus
broaden
the
sphere
of
the
latter
but
besides
its
culture
value
which
i
hold
very
high
such
a
step
would
prepare
for
the
new
important
and
as
we
have
seen
very
inadequately
manned
profession
of
physical
trainers
this
has
moreover
great
but
yet
latent
and
even
unsuspected
capacities
for
the
morals
of
our
academic
youth
grote
states
that
among
the
ancient
greeks
of
all
education
as
devoted
to
the
body
and
galton
urges
that
they
as
much
excelled
us
as
we
do
the
african
negro
they
held
that
if
physical
perfection
was
cultivated
moral
and
mental
excellence
would
follow
and
that
without
this
national
culture
rests
on
an
insecure
basis
in
our
day
there
are
many
new
reasons
to
believe
that
the
best
nations
of
the
future
will
be
those
which
give
most
intelligent
care
to
the

sports

constitute
a
more

older
and
more
popular
field
here
a
very
different
spirit
of
joy
and
gladness
rules
artifacts
often
enter
but
can
not
survive
unless
based
upon
pretty
purely
hereditary
momentum
thus
our
first
problem
is
to
seek
both
the
motor
tendencies
and
the
psychic
motives
bequeathed
to
us
from
the
past
the
view
of
groos
that
play
is
practise
for
future
adult
activities
is
very
partial
superficial
and
perverse
it
ignores
the
past
where
lie
the
keys
to
all
play
activities
true
play
never
practises
what
is
phyletically
new
and
this
industrial
life
often
calls
for
it
exercises
many
atavistic
and
rudimentary
functions
a
number
of
which
will
abort
before
maturity
but
which
live
themselves
out
in
play
like
the
tadpole
tail
that
must
be
both
developed
and
used
as
a
stimulus
to
the
growth
of
legs
which
will
otherwise
never
mature
in
place
of
this
mistaken
and
misleading
view
i
regard
play
as
the
motor
habits
and
spirit
of
the
past
of
the
race
persisting
in
the
present
as
rudimentary
functions
sometimes
of
and
always
akin
to
rudimentary
organs
the
best
index
and
guide
to
the
stated
activities
of
adults
in
past
ages
is
found
in
the
instinctive
untaught
and
plays
of
children
which
are
the
most
spontaneous
and
exact
expressions
of
their
motor
needs
the
young
grow
up
into
the
same
forms
of
motor
activity
as
did
generations
that
have
long
preceded
them
only
to
a
limited
extent
and
if
the
form
of
every
human
occupation
were
to
change
play
would
be
unaffected
save
in
some
of
its
superficial
imitative
forms
it
would
develop
the
motor
capacities
impulses
and
fundamental
forms
of
our
past
heritage
and
the
transformation
of
these
into
later
acquired
adult
forms
is
progressively
later
in
play
every
mood
and
movement
is
instinct
with
heredity
thus
we
rehearse
the
activities
of
our
ancestors
back
we
know
not
how
far
and
repeat
their
life
work
in
summative
and
adumbrated
ways
it
is
reminiscent
albeit
unconsciously
of
our
line
of
descent
and
each
is
the
key
to
the
other
the
impulses
that
prompt
it
are
the
forms
in
which
our
forebears
have
transmitted
to
us
their
habitual
activities
thus
stage
by
stage
we
reënact
their
lives
once
in
the
phylon
many
of
these
activities
were
elaborated
in
the
life
and
death
struggle
for
existence
now
the
elements
and
combinations
oldest
in
the
muscle
history
of
the
race
are
rerepresented
earliest
in
the
individual
and
those
later
follow
in
order
this
is
why
the
heart
of
youth
goes
out
into
play
as
into
nothing
else
as
if
in
it
man
remembered
a
lost
paradise
this
is
why
unlike
gymnastics
play
has
as
much
soul
as
body
and
also
why
it
so
makes
for
unity
of
body
and
soul
that
the
proverb
man
is
whole
only
when
he
plays
suggests
that
the
purest
plays
are
those
that
enlist
both
alike
to
address
the
body
predominantly
strengthens
unduly
the
fleshy
elements
and
to
overemphasize
the
soul
causes
weakness
and
automatisms
thus
understood
play
is
the
ideal
type
of
exercise
for
the
young
most
favorable
for
growth
and
most
in
both
kind
and
amount
for
its
forms
the
pulse
of
adolescent
enthusiasm
beats
highest
it
is
unconstrained
and
free
to
follow
any
outer
or
inner
impulse
the
zest
of
it
vents
and
satisfies
the
strong
passion
of
youth
for
intense
erethic
and
perhaps
orgiastic
states
gives
an
exaltation
of
so
craved
that
with
no
vicarious
outlet
it
often
impels
to
drink

best
of
all
realizes

jäger

would
have
us

that
the

combined
many
of
the
best

of
a
modern

they
were

all

and
that
night
and
death
never
seemed
so
black
as
by
contrast
with
their
splendor
the
deeds
of
the
young
athletes
were
ascribed
to
the
inspiration
of
the
gods
whose
abodes
they
lit
up
with
glory
and
in
doing
them
honor
these
discordant
states
found
a
bond
of
unity

with

the
honor
of

for
whom
the
five
ancient

were

the
eternal
prevalence
of
good
over

the
best

implied
the
best

and
even
plato
to
whom
tradition
gives
not
only
one
of
the
fairest
souls
but
a
body
remarkable
for
both
strength
and
beauty
and
for
whom
weakness
was
perilously
near
to
wickedness
and
ugliness
to
sin
argues
that
education
must
be
so
conducted
that
the
body
can
be
safely
entrusted
to
the
care
of
the
soul
and
suggests
what
later
became
a
slogan
of
a
more
degenerate
gladiatorial
athleticism
that
to
be
well
and
strong
is
to
be
a
philosopher
est
the
greeks
could
hardly
conceive
bodily
apart
from
psychic
education
and
physical
was
for
the
sake
of
mental
training
a
sane
whole
mind
could
hardly
reside
in
an
unsound
body
upon
the
integrity
of
which
it
was
dependent
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
from
this
standpoint
is
a
dangerous
superstition
for
what
frees
the
mind
is
disastrous
if
it
does
not
give
better
ignorance
than
knowledge
that
does
not
develop
a
motor
side
body
culture
is
ultimately
only
for
the
sake
of
the
mind
and
soul
for
body
is
only
its
other
ego
not
only
is
all

at
the
same
time

and
tough
rump
from
much
sitting
or
an
anemic
girl
prodigy
in
the
morning
hectic

evening
electric
is
a
monster
play
at
its
best
is
only
a
school
of
ethics
it
gives
not
only
strength
but
courage
and
confidence
tends
to
simplify
life
and
habits
gives
energy
decision
and
promptness
to
the
will
brings
consolation
and
peace
of
mind
in
evil
days
is
a
resource
in
trouble
and
brings
out
individuality
how
the
ideals
of
physical
preformed
those
of
moral
and
mental
training
in
the
land
and
day
of
socrates
is
seen
in
the
identification
of
knowledge
and
virtue
und
to
know
and
to
have
the
power
to
do
only
an
extreme
and
intellectualism
separates
them
and
assumes
that
it
is
easy
to
know
and
hard
to
do
from
the
ethical
standpoint
philosophy
and
indeed
all
knowledge
is
the
art
of
being
and
doing
good
conduct
is
the
only
real
subject
of
knowledge
and
there
is
no
science
but
morals
he
is
the
best
man
says
xenophon
who
is
always
studying
how
to
improve
and
he
is
the
happiest
who
feels
that
he
is
improving
life
is
a
skill
an
art
like
a
handicraft
and
true
knowledge
a
form
of
will
good
moral
and
physical
development
are
more
than
analogous
and
where
intelligence
is
separated
from
action
the
former
becomes
mystic
abstract
and
desiccated
and
the
latter
formal
routine
thus
mere
conscience
and
psychological
integrity
and
righteousness
are
allied
and
mutually
inspiring
not
only
play
which
is
the
purest
expression
of
motor
heredity
but
work
and
all
exercise
owe
most
of
whatever
pleasure
they
bring
to
the
past
the
first
influence
of
all
right
exercise
for
those
in
health
is
feeling
of
and
exhilaration
this
is
one
chief
source
of
the
strange
enthusiasm
felt
for
many
special
forms
of
activity
and
the
feeling
is
so
strong
that
it
animates
many
forms
of
it
that
are
hygienically
unfit
to
act
vigorously
from
a
full
store
of
energy
gives
a
reflex
of
pleasure
that
is
sometimes
a
passion
and
may
fairly
intoxicate
animals
must
move
or
cease
growing
and
die
while
to
be
weak
is
to
be
miserable
to
feel
strong
is
a
joy
and
glory
it
gives
a
sense
of
superiority
dignity
endurance
courage
confidence
enterprise
power
personal
validity
virility
and
virtue
in
the
etymological
sense
of
that
noble
word
to
be
active
agile
strong
is
especially
the
glory
of
young
men
our
nature
and
history
have
so
disposed
our
frame
that
thus
all
physiological
and
psychic
processes
are
stimulated
products
of
decomposition
are
washed
out
by
oxygenation
and
elimination
the
best
reaction
of
all
the
ganglionic
and
sympathetic
activities
is
accused
and
vegetative
processes
are
normalized
activity
may
exalt
the
spirit
almost
to
the
point
of
ecstasy
and
the
physical
pleasure
of
it
diffuse
irradiate
and
mitigate
the
sexual
stress
just
at
the
age
when
its
premature
localization
is
most
deleterious
just
enough
at
the
proper
time
and
rate
contributes
to
permanent
elasticity
of
mood
and
disposition
gives
moral
rouses
a
love
of
freedom
with
all
that
that
great
word
means
and
favors
all
higher
human
aspirations
in
all
these
modes
of
developing
our
efferent
powers
we
conceive
that
the
race
comes
very
close
to
the
individual
youth
and
that
ancestral
momenta
animate
motor
neurons
and
muscles
and
preside
over
most
of
the
combinations
some
of
the
elements
speak
with
a
still
small
voice
raucous
with
age
the
first
spontaneous
movements
of
infancy
are
hieroglyphs
to
most
of
which
we
have
as
yet
no
good
key
many
elements
are
so
impacted
and
felted
together
that
we
can
not
analyze
them
many
are
extinct
and
many
perhaps
made
but
once
and
only
hint
things
we
can
not
apprehend
later
the
rehearsals
are
fuller
and
their
significance
more
intelligible
and
in
boyhood
and
youth
the
correspondences
are
plain
to
all
who
have
eyes
to
see
pleasure
is
always
exactly
proportional
to
the
directness
and
force
of
the
current
of
heredity
and
in
play
we
feel
most
fully
and
intensely
ancestral
joys
the
pain
of
toil
died
with
our
forebears
its
vestiges
in
our
play
give
pure
delight
its
variety
prompts
to
diversity
that
enlarges
our
life
primitive
men
and
animals
played
and
that
too
has
left
its
traces
in
us
some
urge
that
work
was
evolved
or
degenerated
from
play
but
the
play
field
broadens
with
succeeding
generations
youth
is
prolonged
for
play
is
always
and
everywhere
the
best
synonym
of
youth
all
are
young
at
play
and
only
in
play
and
the
best
possible
characterization
of
old
age
is
the
absence
of
the
soul
and
body
of
play
only
senile
and
overspecialized
tissues
of
brain
heart
and
muscles
know
it
not
gulick
has
urged
that
what
makes
certain
exercises
more
interesting
than
others
is
to
be
found
in
the
phylon
the
power
to
throw
with
accuracy
and
speed
was
once
pivotal
for
survival
and
were
eliminated
those
who
could
throw
unusually
well
best
overcame
enemies
killed
game
and
sheltered
family
the
nervous
and
muscular
systems
are
organized
with
certain
definite
tendencies
and
have
back
of
them
a
racial
setting
so
running
and
dodging
with
speed
and
endurance
and
hitting
with
a
club
were
also
basal
to
hunting
and
fighting
now
that
the
need
of
these
is
leas
urgent
for
utilitarian
purposes
they
are
still
necessary
for
perfecting
the
organism
this
makes
for
instance
baseball
racially
familiar
because
it
represents
activities
that
were
once
and
for
a
long
time
necessary
for
survival
we
inherit
tendencies
of
muscular
coördination
that
have
been
of
great
racial
utility
the
best
athletic
sports
and
games
a
composed
of
these
racially
old
elements
so
that
phylogenetic
muscular
history
is
of
great
importance
why
is
it
this
writer
asks
that
a
city
man
so
loves
to
sit
all
day
and
fish
it
is
because
this
interest
dates
back
to
time
immemorial
we
are
the
sons
of
fishermen
and
early
life
was
by
the
water
side
and
this
is
our
food
supply
this
explains
why
certain
exercises
are
more
interesting
than
others
it
is
because
they
touch
and
revive
the
deep
basic
emotions
of
the
race
thus
we
see
that
play
is
not
doing
things
to
be
useful
later
but
it
is
rehearsing
racial
history
plays
and
games
change
only
in
their
external
form
but
the
underlying
activities
and
also
the
psychic
content
of
them
are
the
same
just
as
psychic
states
must
be
lived
out
up
through
the
grades
so
the
physical
activities
most
be
played
off
each
in
its
own
time
the
best
exercise
for
the
young
should
thus
be
more
directed
to
develop
the
basal
powers
old
to
the
race
than
those
peculiar
to
the
individual
and
it
should
enforce
those
and
muscular
forms
which
race
habit
has
banded
down
rather
than
insist
upon
those
arbitrarily
designed
to
develop
our
ideas
of
symmetry
regardless
of
heredity
the
best
guide
to
the
former
is
zest
and
spontaneity
hereditary
moment
really
determine
too
the
order

jackson

well

speech
uses
most
of
the

organs
as
does

but
those
concerned
with
the
former
are
controlled
from
a
higher
level
of
by

mastication
deglutition
we
are
thus
developing
speech
organs
thus
not
only
the
kind
but
the
time
of
forms
and
degrees
of
exercise
is
best
prescribed
by
heredity
all
growth
is
more
or
less
rhythmic
there
are
seasons
of
rapid
increment
followed
by
rest
and
then
perhaps
succeeded
by
a
period
of
augmentation

this
may
occur
several
times

at

produce
such
immediate

development
of

utterly

donaldson
showed
that
if
the
eyelid
of
a
young
kitten
be
forced
open
prematurely
at
birth
and
stimulated
with
light
medullation
was
premature
and
imperfect
so
too
if
proper
exercise
is
deferred
too
long
we
know
that
little
result
is
achieved
the
sequence
in
which
the
maturation
of
levels
nerve
areas
and
bundles
of
fibers
develop
may
be
as
flechsig
thinks
causal
or
according
to
cajal
energy
originally
employed
in
growth
by
cell
division
later
passes
to
fiber
extension
and
the
development
of
latent
cells
or
as
in
young
children
the
nascent
period
of
finger
movements
may
stimulate
that
of
the
thumb
which
comes
later
and
the
independent
movement
of
the
two
eyes
their
subsequent
coördination
and
so
on
to
perhaps
a
third
and
yet
higher
level
thus
exercise
ought
to
develop

first
intention
and
fulfil
the
law
of
nascent
periods
or
else
not
only
no
good
but
great
harm
may
be
done
hence
every
determination
of
these
periods
is
of
great
practical
as
well
as
scientific
importance
the
following
are
the
chief
attempts
yet
made
to
fix
them
which
show
the
significance
of
adolescence
the
doll
curve
reaches
its
point
of
highest
intensity
between
eight
and
nine
and
it
is
nearly
ended
at
fifteen
although
it
may
persist
children
can
give
no
better
reason
why
they
stop
playing
with
dolls
than
because
other
things
are
liked
better
or
they
are
too
old
ashamed
love
real
babies
etc
the
roman
girl
when
ripe
for
marriage
hung
up
her
childhood
doll
as
a
votive
offering
to
venus
carlyle
who
was
compelled
to
stop
made
sumptuous
dresses
and
a
bed
and
made
her
doll
die
upon
a
funeral
pyre
like
dido
after
speaking
her
last
farewell
and
stabbing
herself
with
a
penknife
by
way
of
tyrian
sword
at
thirteen
or
fourteen
it
is
more
distinctly
realized
that
dolls
are
not
real
because
they
have
no
inner
life
or
feeling
yet
many
continue
to
play
with
them
with
great
pleasure
in
secret
till
well
on
in
the
teens
or
twenties
occasionally
single
women
or
married
women
with
no
children
and
in
rare
cases
even
those
who
have
children
play
dolls
all
their
lives
gales
student
concluded
that
the
girls
who
played
with
dolls
up
to
or
into
pubescent
years
were
usually
those
who
had
the
fewest
number
that
they
played
with
them
in
the
most
realistic
manner
kept
them
because
actually
most
fond
of
them
and
were
likely
to
be
more
scientific
steady
and
less
sentimental
than
those
who
dropped
them
early
but
the
instinct
that
dollifies
new
or
most
unfit
things
is
gone
as
also
the
subtle
points
of
contact
between
doll
play
and
idolatry
before
puberty
dolls
are
more
likely
to
be
adults
after
puberty
they
are
almost
always
children
or
babies
there
is
no
longer
a
struggle
between
doubt
and
reality
in
the
doll
cosmos
no
more
abandon
to
the
doll
illusion
but
where
it
lingers
it
is
a
more
atavistic
rudiment
and
just
as
at
the
height
of
the
fever
dolls
are
only
in
small
part
representatives
of
future
children
the
saying
that
the
first
child
is
the
last
doll
is
probably
false
nor
are
doll
and
child
comparable
to
first
and
second
dentition
and
it
is
doubtful
if
children
who
play
with
dolls
as
children
with
too
great
abandonment
are
those
who
make
the
best
mothers
later
or
if
it
has
any
value
as
a
preliminary
practise
of
motherhood
the
number
of
motor
activities
that
are
both
inspired
and
unified
by
this
form
of
play
and
that
can
always
be
given
wholesome
direction
is
almost
incredible
and
has
been
too
long
neglected
both
by
psychologists
and
teachers
few
purer
types
of
the
rehearsal
by
the
individual
of
the
history
of
the
race
can
probably
be
found
even
though
we
can
not
yet
analyze
the
many
elements
involved
and
assign
to
each
its
phyletic
correlate
in
an
interesting
paper
gulick
divides
play
into
three
childish
periods
separated
by
the
ages
three
and
seven
and
attempts
to
characterize
the
plays
of
early
adolescence
from
twelve
to
seventeen
and
of
later
adolescence
from
seventeen
to
of
the
first
two
periods
he
says
children
before
seven
rarely
play
games
spontaneously
but
often
do
so
under
the
stimulus
of
older
persons
from
seven
to
twelve
games
are
almost
exclusively
individualistic
and
competitive
but
in
early
adolescence
two
elements
predominate
first
the
plays
are
predominantly
team
games
in
which
the
individual
is
more
or
less
sacrificed
for
the
whole
in
which
there
is
obedience
to
a
captain
in
which
there
is
coöperation
among
a
number
for
a
given
end
in
which
play
has
a
program
and
an
end
the
second
characteristic
of
the
period
is
with
reference
to
its
plays
and
there
seems
to
be
all
of
savage
life
hunting
fishing
stealing
swimming
rowing
sailing
fighting
adventure
love
of
animals
etc
this
characteristic
obtains
more
with
boys
than
with
girls
the
plays
of
adolescence
are
socialistic
demanding
the
heathen
virtues
of
courage
endurance
bravery
loyalty
enthusiasm
croswell
found
that
among
children
familiar
with
kinds
of
amusements
those
involving
physical
exercises
predominated
over
all
others
and
that
at
every
age
after
the
eighth
year
they
were
represented
as
almost
two
to
one
and
in
the
sixteenth
year
rose
among
boys
as
four
to
one
the
age
of
the
greatest
number
of
different
amusements
is
from
ten
to
eleven
nearly
fifteen
being
mentioned
but
for
the
next
eight
or
nine
years
there
is
a
steady
decline
of
number
and
progressive
specialisation
occurs
the
games
of
chase
which
are
suggestive
on
the
recapitulation
theory
rise
from
eleven
per
cent
in
boys
of
six
to
nineteen
per
cent
at
nine
but
soon
after
decline
and
at
sixteen
have
fallen
to
less
than
four
per
cent
toys
and
original
games
decline
still
earlier
while
ball
rises
steadily
and
rapidly
to
eighteen
and
card
and
table
games
rise
very
steadily
from
ten
to
fifteen
in
girls
but
the
increment
is
much
less
in
boys
a
third
or
more
of
all
the
amusements
of
boys
just
entering
their
teens
are
games
of
contest
games
in
which
the
end
is
in
one
way
or
another
to
gain
an
advantage
one
fellows
in
which
the
interest
is
n
the
struggle
between
peers
as
children
approach
the
teens
a
tendency
arises
that
is
well
expressed
by
one
of
the
girls
who
no
longer
makes
playthings
but
things
that
are
useful
parents
and
society
must
therefore
provide
the
most
favorable
conditions
for
the
kind
of
amusement
fitting
at
each
age
as
the
child
grows
older
society
plays
a
larger
rôle
in
all
the
child
amusements
and
from
the
thirteenth
year
amusements
take
on
a
decidedly
coöperative
and
competitive
character
and
efforts
are
ore
and
more
confined
to
the
accomplishments
of
some
definite
aim
the
course
for
this
period
will
concentrate
the
effort
upon
fewer
lines
and
more
time
will
be
devoted
to
each
the
desire
for
mastery
is
now
at
its
height
the
instinct
is
to
maintain
one
self
independently
and
ask
no
odds
at
fourteen
especially
the
impulse
is
in
manual
training
to
make
something
and
perhaps
to
coöperate
mcghee
collected
the
play
preferences
of
children
and
found
a
very
steady
decline
in
running
plays
among
girls
from
nine
to
eighteen
but
a
far
more
rapid
rise
in
plays
of
chance
from
eleven
to
fifteen
and
a
very
rapid
rise
from
sixteen
to
eighteen
from
eleven
onward
with
the
most
marked
fall
before
fourteen
there
was
a
distinct
decline
in
imitative
games
for
girls
and
a
slower
one
for
boys
games
involving
rivalry
increased
rapidly
among
boys
from
eleven
to
sixteen
and
still
more
rapidly
among
girls
their
percentage
of
preference
even
exceeding
that
of
boys
at
eighteen
when
it
reached
nearly
seventy
per
cent
with
adolescence
specialization
upon
a
few
plays
was
markedly
increased
in
the
teens
among
boys
whereas
with
girls
in
general
there
were
a
large
number
of
plays
which
were
popular
with
none
preëminent
even
at
this
age
the
principle
of
organization
in
games
so
strong
with
boys
is
very
slight
with
girls
puberty
showed
the
greatest
increase
of
interest
among
pubescent
girls
for
croquet
and
among
boys
for
swimming
although
baseball
and
football
the
most
favored
for
boys
rose
rapidly
although
the
author
does
not
state
it
it
would
seem
from
his
data
that
plays
peculiar
to
the
different
seasons
were
most
marked
among
boys
in
part
at
least
because
their
activities
are
more
out
of
doors
ferrero
and
others
have
shown
that
the
more
intense
activities
of
primitive
people
tend
to
be
rhythmic
and
with
strongly
automatic
features
no
form
of
activity
is
more
universal
than
the
dance
which
is
not
only
intense
but
may
express
chiefly
in
terms
of
fundamental
movements
stripped
of
their
accessory
finish
and
detail
every
important
act
vocation
sentiment
or
event
in
the
life
of
man
in
language
so
universal
and
symbolic
that
music
and
poetry
themselves
seem
to
have
arisen
out
of
it
before
it
became
specialized
much
labor
was
cast
in
rhythmic
form
and
often
accompanied
by
and
even
tone
to
secure
the
stimulus
of
concert
on
both
economic
and
social
principles
in
the
dark
background
of
history
there
is
now
much
evidence
that
at
some
point
play
art
and
work
were
not
divorced
they
all
may
have
sprung
from
rhythmic
movement
which
is
so
in
biology
because
it
secures
most
joy
of
life
with
least
expense
by
it
eros
of
old
ordered
chaos
and
by
its
judicious
use
the
human
soul
is
cadenced
to
great
efforts
toward
high
ideals
the
many
to
secure
concerted
action
in
lifting
pulling
stepping
the
use
of
flail
lever
saw
ax
hammer
hoe
loom
show
that
areas
and
thesis
represent
flexion
and
extension
that
accent
originated
in
the
acme
of
muscular
stress
as
well
as
how
rhythm
eases
work
and
also
makes
it
social
most
of
the
old
are
lost
and
machines
have
made
work
more
serial
while
rhythms
are
obscured
or
imposed
from
without
so
as
to
limit
the
freedom
they
used
to
express
now
all
basal
central
or
strength
movements
tend
to
be
oscillatory
automatically
repetitive
or
rhythmic
like
savage
music
as
if
the
waves
of
the
primeval
sea
whence
we
came
still
beat
in
them
just
as
all
fine
peripheral
and
late
movements
tend
to
be
serial
special
vastly
complex
end
diversified
it
is
thus
natural
that
during
the
period
of
greatest
strength
increment
in
muscular
development
the
rhythmic
function
of
nearly
all
fundamental
movements
should
be
strongly
accentuated
at
the
dawn
of
this
age
boys
love
marching
and
as
our
returns
show
there
is
a
very
remarkable
rise
in
the
passion
for
beating
time
jigging
double
shuffling
rhythmic
clapping
etc
the
more
prominent
the
factor
of
repetition
the
more
automatic
and
the
less
strenuous
is
the
hard
and
new
effort
of
constant
psychic
adjustment
and
attention
college
yells
cheers
rowing
marching
processions
bicycling
running
calisthenics
and
class
gymnastics
with
counting
and
especially
with
music
horseback
riding
are
rhythmic
tennis
baseball
and
football
basketball
golf
polo
are
less
rhythmic
but
are
concerted
and
intense
these
latter
emphasise
the
conflict
factor
best
brought
out
in
fencing
boxing
and
wrestling
and
lay
more
stress
on
the
psychic
elements
of
attention
and
skill
the
effect
of
musical
accompaniment
which
the
swedish
system
wrongly
rejects
is
to
make
the
exercises
more
fundamental
and
automatic
and
to
proportionately
diminish
the
conscious
effort
and
relieve
the
mechanism
involved
in
fine
movements
adolescence
is
the
golden
period
of
nascency
for
rhythm
before
this
change
many
children
have
a
very
imperfect
sense
of
it
and
even
those
who
march
sing
play
or
read
poetry
with
correct
and
overemphasised
time
marking
experience
a
great
broadening
of
the
horizon
of
consciousness
and
a
marked
and
for
mental
power
and
scope
increase
in
the
carrying
power
of
attention
and
the
the
soul
now
feels
the
beauty
of
cadences
good
ascension
and
the
symmetry
of
periods
and
all
as
i
am
convinced
because
this
is
the
springtime
of
the
strength
movements
which
are
predominantly
rhythmic
not
only
does
music
start
in
time
marking
the
drum
being
the
oldest
instrument
but
quantity
long
took
precedence
of
sense
and
form
of
content
both
melody
and
words
coming
later
even
rhythmic
tapping
or
beating
of
the
foot
whence
the
poetic
feet
of
prosody
and
meter
thus
later
imposed
monotonous
prose
to
make
poetry
exhilarates
makes
glad
the
soul
and
inspires
it
to
attack
gives
compulsion
and
a
sense
of
unity
the
psychology
of
rhythm
shows
its
basal
value
in
cadencing
the
soul
we
can
not
conceive
what
war
love
and
religion
would
be
without
it
the
old
adage
that
the
parent
of
prose
is
poetry
the
parent
of
poetry
is
music
the
parent
of
music
is
rhythm
and
the
parent
of
rhythm
is
god
seems
borne
out
not
only
in
history
but
by
the
nature
of
thought
and
attention
that
does
not
move
in
a
continuum
but
flies
and
perches
alternately
or
on
and
as
if
influenced
by
the
tempo
of
the
leg
swinging
as
a
compound
pendulum
dancing
is
one
of
the
best
expressions
of
pure
play
and
of
the
motor
needs
of
youth
perhaps
it
is
the
most
liberal
of
all
forms
of
motor
education
schopenhauer
thought
it
the
apex
of
physiological
irritability
and
that
it
made
animal
life
most
vividly
conscious
of
its
existence
and
most
exultant
in
exhibiting
it
in
very
ancient
times
china
ritualised
it
in
the
spring

made
it
a
large
part
of
the

of

of
thirteen
neale
thinks
it
was
originally
circular
or
orbicular
worship
which
he
deems
oldest
in
japan
in
the
priestly
salic
college
of
ancient

in

in
the
greek
apollo
cult
it
was
a
form
of

st
basil

it
gregory
introduced
it
into

services
the
early
christian
bishops
called
præsuls
led
the
sacred
dance
around
the
altar
and
only
in
and
again
in
was
it
forbidden
in
church
neale
and
others
have
shown
how
the
choral
processionals
with
all
the
added
charm
of
vestment
and
intonation
have
had
far
more
to
do
in
christianizing
many
low
tribes
who
could
not
understand
the
language
of
the
church

savages
are
nearly
all
great
dancers
imitating
every
animal
they
know
dancing
out
their
own
legends
with
ritual
sometimes
so
exacting
that
error
means
death
the
character
of
people
is
often
learned
from
their
dances
and
molière
says
the
destiny
of
nations
depends
on
them
the
gayest
dancers
are
often
among
the
most
downtrodden
and
unhappy
people
some
mysteries
can
be
revealed
only
in
them
as
holy
if
we
consider
the
history
of
secular
dances
we
find
that
some
of
them
when
first
invented
or
in
vogue
evoked
the
greatest
enthusiasm
one
writer
says
that
the
polka
so
delighted
france
and
england
that
statesmen
forgot
politics
the
spirit
of
the
old
polish
aristocracy
still
lives
in
the
polonaise
the
gipsy
dances
have
inspired
a
new
school
of
music
the
greek

out
of
the
evolution
of

national
dances
like
the
hornpipe
and

of

the
of
germany
the
of
france
the
spanish
tarantella
and
the

from

racial

and

conceptions
and
every
industry
or
characteristic
act
of
life
in
pantomime
and
gesture
we
have
in
the
dance
of
the
modern
ballroom
only
a
degenerate
relict
with
at
best
but
a
very
insignificant
culture
value
and
too
often
stained
with
bad
associations
this
is
most
unfortunate
for
youth
and
for
their
sake
a
work
of
rescue
and
revival
is
greatly
needed
for
it
is
perhaps
not
excepting
even
music
the
completest
language
of
the
emotions
and
can
be
made
one
of
the
best
schools
of
sentiment
and
even
will
inculcating
good
states
of
mind
and
exorcising
bad
ones
as
few
other
agencies
have
power
to
do
right
dancing
can
cadence
the
very
soul
give
nervous
poise
and
control
bring
harmony
between
basal
and
finer
muscles
and
also
between
feeling
and
intellect
body
and
mind
it
can
serve
both
as
an
awakener
and
a
test
of
intelligence
predispose
the
heart
against
vice
and
turn
the
springs
of
character
toward
virtue
that
its
present
decadent
forms
for
those
too
devitalized
to
dance
aright
can
be
demoralizing
we
know
in
this
day
too
well
although
even
questionable
dances
may
sometimes
work
off
vicious
propensities
in
ways
more
harmless
than
those
in
which
they
would
otherwise
find
vent
its
utilization
for
and
influence
on
the
insane
would
be
another
interesting
chapter
very
interesting
scientifically
and
suggestive
practically
is
another
correspondence
which
i
believe
to
be
new
between
the
mode
of
spontaneous
activity
in
youth
and
that
of
labor
in
the
early
history
of
the
race
one
of
the
most
marked
distinctions
between
savage
and
civilized
races
is
in
the
longer
rhythm
of
work
and
relaxation
the
former
are
idle
and
lazy
for
days
weeks
and
perhaps
months
and
then
put
forth
intense
and
prolonged
effort
in
dance
hunt
warfare
migration
or
construction
sometimes
dispensing
with
sleep
and
manifesting
remarkable
endurance
as
civilization
and
specialization
advance
hours
become
regular
the
cultured
man
is
less
desultory
in
all
his
habits
from
eating
and
sleeping
to
performing
social
and
religious
duties
although
he
may
put
forth
no
more
aggregate
energy
in
a
year
than
the
savage
women
are
schooled
to
regular
work
long
before
men
and
the
difficulty
of
imposing
civilization
upon
low
races
is
compared
by
bücher
to
that
of
training
a
eat
to
work
when
harnessed
to
a
it
is
not
dread
of
fatigue
but
of
the
monotony
of
method
makes
them
hate
labor
the
effort
of
savages
is
more
intense
and
their
periods
of
rest
more
prolonged
and
inert
darwin
thinks
all
vital
function
bred
to
go
in
periods
as
vertebrates
are
descended
from
tidal
ascidian
there
is
indeed
much
that
suggests
some
other
irregular
rhythm
more
or
less
independent
of
day
and
night
and
perhaps
sexual
in
its
nature
but
not
lunar
and
for
males
this
mode
of
life
not
only
preceded
the
industrial
and
commercial
period
of
which
regularity
is
a
prime
condition
but
it
lasted
indefinitely
longer
than
the
latter
has
yet
existed
during
this
early
time
great
exertion
sometimes
to
the
point
of
utter
exhaustion
and
collapse
alternated
with
seasons
of
almost
vegetative
existence
we
see
abundant
traces
of
this
psychosis
in
the
muscle
habits
of
adolescents
and
i
think
in
student
and
particularly
in
college
life
which
can
enforce
regularity
only
to
a
limited
extent
this
is
not
reversion
but
partly
expression
of
the
nature
and
perhaps
the
needs
of
this
stage
of
immaturity
and
partly
the
same
instinct
of
revolt
against
uniformity
imposed
from
without
which
rob
life
of
variety
and
extinguish
the
spirit
of
adventure
and
untrammeled
freedom
and
make
the
savage
hard
to
break
to
the
harness
of
civilization
the
hunger
for
fatigue
too
can
become
a
veritable
passion
and
is
quite
distinct
from
either
the
impulse
for
activity
for
its
own
sake
or
the
desire
of
achievement
to
shout
and
put
forth
the
utmost
possible
strength
in
crude
ways
is
erethic
intoxication
at
a
stage
when
every
tissue
can
become
erectile
and
seems
like
the
crying
of
infants
to
have
a
legitimate
function
in
causing
tension
and
flushing
enlarging
the
caliber
of
blood
vessels
and
forcing
the
blood
perhaps
even
to
the
point
of
extravasation
to
irrigate
newly
growing
fibers
cells
and
organs
which
atrophy
if
not
thus
fed
when
maturity
is
complete
this
need
abates
if
this
be
correct
the
phenomenon
of
second
breath
so
characteristic
of
adolescence
and
one
factor
in
the
inebriate
propensity
is
ontogenetic
expression
of
a
rhythm
trait
of
a
long
racial
period
youth
needs
overexertion
to
compensate
for
underexertion
to
undersleep
in
order
to
offset
oversleep
at
times
this
seems
to
be
nature
provision
to
expand
in
all
directions
its
possibilities
of
the
body
and
soul
in
this
plastic
period
when
without
this
occasional
excess
powers
would
atrophy
or
suffer
arrest
for
want
of
use
or
larger
possibilities
world
not
be
realized
without
this
regimen
peculiar
to
nascent
periods
this
is
treated
more
fully
elsewhere
perhaps
next
to
dancing
in
phyletic
motivation
come
personal
conflicts
such
as
wrestling
fighting
boxing
dueling
and
in
some
sense
hunting
the
animal
world
is
full
of
struggle
for
survival
and
primitive
warfare
is
a
wager
of
battle
of
personal
combat
of
foes
contesting
eye
to
eye
and
hand
to
hand
where
victory
of
one
is
the
defeat
and
perhaps
death
of
the
other
and
where
life
is
often
staked
against
life
in
its
more
brutal
forms
we
see
one
of
the
most
degrading
of
all
the
aspects
of
human
nature
burk
has
shown
how
the
most
bestial
of
these
instincts
survive
and
crop
out
irresistibly
in
boyhood
where
fights
are
often
engaged
in
with
desperate
abandon
noses
are
bitten
ears
torn
sensitive
places
kicked
hair
pulled
arms
twisted
the
head
stamped
on
and
pounded
on
stones
fingers
twisted
and
hoodlums
sometimes
deliberately
try
to
strangle
gouge
out
an
eye
pull
off
an
ear
pull
out
the
tongue
break
teeth
nose
or
bones
or
dislocate
jaws
or
other
joints
wring
the
neck
bite
off
a
lip
and
torture
in
utterly
nameless
ways
in
unrestrained
anger
man
becomes
a
demon
in
love
with
the
blood
of
his
victim
the
face
is
distorted
and
there
are
yells
oaths
animal
snorts
and
grunts
cries
and
then
exultant
laughter
at
pain
and
each
is
bruised
dirty
disheveled
and
panting
with
exhaustion
for
coarser
natures
the
spectacle
of
such
conflicts
has
an
intense
attraction
while
some
morbid
souls
are
scarred
by
a
distinct
phobia
for
everything
suggestive
of
even
lower
degrees
of
opposition
these
instincts
more
or
less
developed
in
boyhood
are
repressed
in
normal
cases
before
strength
and
skill
are
sufficiently
developed
to
inflict
serious
bodily
injury
while
without
the
reductives
that
orthogenetic
growth
brings
they
become
criminal
repulsive
as
are
these
grosser
and
animal
manifestations
of
anger
its
impulsion
can
not
and
should
not
be
eliminated
but
its
expression
transformed
and
directed
toward
evils
that
need
all
its
antagonism
to
be
angry
aright
is
a
good
part
of
moral
education
and
under
all
provocations
is
unmanly
craven
and
cowardly
an
young
man
who
can
not
fight
physically
can
hardly
have
a
high
and
true
sense
of
honor
and
is
generally
a
milksop
a
or
sneak
he
lacks
virility
his
masculinity
does
not
ring
true
his
honesty
can
not
be
sound
to
the
core
hence
instead
of
eradicating
this
instinct
one
of
the
great
problems
of
physical
and
moral
pedagogy
is
rightly
to
temper
and
direct
it
sparta
sedulously
cultivated
it
in
boys
and
in
the
great
english
schools
where
for
generations
it
has
been
more
or
less
tacitly
recognized
it
is
regulated
by
custom
and
their
literature
and
traditions
abound
in
illustrations
of
its
and
often
transforming
influence
in
ways
well
appreciated
by
hughes
and
arnold
it
makes
against
degeneration
the
essential
feature
of
which
is
weakening
of
will
and
loss
of
honor
real
virtue
requires
enemies
and
women
and
effeminate
and
old
men
want
placid
comfortable
peace
while
a
real
man
rejoices
in
noble
strife
which
sanctifies
all
great
causes
casts
out
fear
and
is
the
chief
school
of
courage
bad
as
is
overpugnacity
a
scrapping
boy
is
better
than
one
who
funks
a
fight
and
i
have
no
patience
with
the
sentimentality
that
would
here
pour
out
the
child
with
the
bath
but
would
have
every
healthy
boy
taught
boxing
at
adolescence
if
not
before
the
is
degrading
and
brutal
but
in
lieu
of
better
illustrations
of
the
spirit
of
personal
contest
i
would
interest
a
certain
class
of
boys
in
it
and
try
to
devise
modes
of
pedagogic
utilization
of
the
immense
store
of
interest
it
generates
like
dancing
it
should
be
rescued
from
its
evil
associations
and
its
educational
force
put
to
do
moral
work
even
though
it
be
by
way
of
individual
prescriptions
for
specific
defects
of
character
at
its
best
it
is
indeed
a
manly
art
a
superb
school
for
quickness
of
eye
and
hand
decision
force
of
will
and
the
moment
this
is
lost
stinging
punishment
follows
hence
it
is
the
surest
of
all
cures
for
excessive
irascibility
and
has
been
found
to
have
a
most
beneficent
effect
upon
a
peevish
or
unmanly
disposition
it
has
no
mean
theoretic
side
of
rules
kinds
of
blow
and
counters
arts
of
drawing
out
and
tiring
an
opponent
hindering
but
not
injuring
him
defensive
and
offensive
tactics
and
it
addresses
chiefly
the
fundamental
muscles
in
both
training
and
conflict
i
do
not
underestimate
the
many
and
great
difficulties
of
proper
purgation
but
i
know
from
both
personal
practise
and
observation
that
they
are
not
unconquerable
this
form
of
personal
conflict
is
better
than
dueling
even
in
its
comparatively
harmless
german
student
form
although
this
has
been
warmly
defended
by
jacob
grimm
bismarck
and
treitschke
while
paulsen
professor
of
philosophy
and
pedagogy
and
schrempf
of
theology
have
pronounced
it
but
a
slight
evil
and
several
americans
have
thought
it
better
than
hazing
which
it
makes
impossible
the
dark
side
of
dueling
is
seen
in
the
hypertrophied
sense
of
honor
which
under
the
code
of
the
corps
becomes
an
intricate
and
fantastic
thing
prompting
according
to
ziegler
a
club
of
sixteen
students
to
fight
over
two
hundred
duels
in
four
weeks
in
jena
early
in
this
century
it
is
prone
to
degenerate
to
an
artificial
etiquette
demanding
satisfaction
for
slight
and
unintended
offenses
although
this
professor
who
had
his
own
face
scarred
on
the
pleaded
for
a
student
court
of
honor
with
power
to
brand
acts
as
infamous
and
even
to
expel
students
on
the
ground
that
honor
had
grown
more
inward
the
traditions
in
favor
of
dueling
were
too
strong
the
duel
had
a
religious
romantic
origin
as
revealing
god
judgment
and
means
that
the
victim
of
an
insult
is
ready
to
stake
body
or
even
life
and
this
is
still
its
ideal
side
anachronism
as
it
now
is
and
degenerating
readily
to
sport
or
spectacle
overpunishing
what
is
often
mere
awkwardness
or
ignorance
it
still
impresses
a
certain
sense
of
responsibility
for
conduct
and
gives
some
physical
training
slight
and
specialized
though
it
be
the
code
is
conventional
drawn
directly
from
old
french
military
life
and
is
not
true
to
the
line
that
separates
real
honor
from
dishonor
deliberate
insult
that
wounds
normal
from
injury
fancied
by
oversensitiveness
or
feigned
by
arrogance
so
that
in
its
present
form
it
is
not
the
best
safeguard
of
the
sacred
shrine
of
personality
against
invasion
of
ifs
rights
if
as
is
claimed
it
is
some
diversion
from
or
fortification
against
corrosive
sensuality
it
has
generally
allied
itself
with
excessive
fencing
while
an
art
susceptible
of
high
development
and
valuable
for
both
pose
and
poise
and
requiring
great
quickness
of
eye
arm
and
wrist
is
unilateral
and
robbed
of
the
vest
of
inflicting
real
pain
on
an
antagonist
bushido
which
means
ways
designates
the
japanese
conception
of
honor
in
behavior
and
in
fighting
the
youth
is
inspired
by
the
ideal
of
tom
brown
to
leave
behind
him
the
name
of
a
fellow
who
never
bullied
a
little
boy
or
turned
his
back
on
a
big
one
it
expresses
the
race
ideal
of
justice
patriotism
and
the
duty
of
living
aright
and
dying
nobly
it
means
also
sympathy
pity
and
love
for
only
the
bravest
can
be
the
tenderest
and
those
most
in
love
are
most
daring
and
it
includes
politeness
and
the
art
of
poetry
honor
is
a
sense
of
personal
dignity
and
worth
so
the
is
truthful
without
an
oath
at
the
tender
age
of
five
the
is
given
a
real
sword
and
this
gives
and
responsibility
at
fifteen
two
sharp
and
artistic
ones
long
and
short
are
given
him
which
must
be
his
companions
for
life
they
were
made
by
a
smith
whose
shop
is
a
sanctuary
and
who
begins
his
work
with
prayer
they
have
the
finest
hilts
and
scabbards
and
are
besung
as
invested
with
a
charm
or
spell
and
symbolic
of
loyalty
and
for
they
must
never
be
drawn
lightly
he
is
taught
fencing
archery
horsemanship
tactics
the
spear
ethics
and
literature
anatomy
for
offence
and
defense
he
must
be
indifferent
to
money
hold
his
life
cheap
beside
honor
and
die
if
it
is
gone
this
chivalry
is
called
the
soul
of
japan
and
if
it
fades
life
is
vulgarised
it
is
a
code
of
ethics
and
physical
training
football
is
a
magnificent
game
if
played
on
honor
an
english
tennis
champion
was
lately
playing
a
rubber
game
with
the
american
champion
they
were
even
and
near
the
end
when
the
american
made
a
bad
fluke
which
would
have
lost
this
country
its
championship
the
english
player
scorning
to
win
on
an
accident
intentionally
made
a
similar
mistake
that
the
best
man
might
win
the
chief
evil
of
modern
american
football
which
now
threatens
its
suppression
in
some
colleges
is
the
lust
to
win
at
any
price
and
results
in
tricks
and
secret
practise
these
sneaky
methods
impair
the
sentiment
of
honor
which
is
the
best
and
most
potent
of
all
the
moral
safeguards
of
youth
so
that
a
young
man
can
not
be
a
true
gentleman
on
the
gridiron
this
ethical
degeneration
is
far
worse
than
all
the
braises
sprains
broken
bones
and
even
deaths
it
causes
wrestling
is
a
form
of
personal
encounter
which
in
antiquity
reached
a
high
development
and
which
although
now
more
known
and
practised
as
athletics
of
the
body
than
of
the
soul
has
certain
special
disciplinary
capacities
in
its
various
forms
it
represents
the
most
primitive
type
of
the
struggle
of
unarmed
and
unprotected
man
with
man
purged
of
its
barbarities
and
in
its
form
and
properly
subject
to
rules
it
cultivates
more
kinds
of
movements
than
any
other
form
for
limbs
trunk
neck
hand
foot
and
all
in
the
upright
and
in
every
prone
position
it
too
has
its
manual
of
feints
holds
tricks
and
specialties
and
calls
out
wariness
quickness
strength
and
shiftiness
victory
need
involve
no
cruelty
or
even
pain
to
the
vanquished
the
very
closeness
of
body
to
body
emphasizing
flexor
rather
than
extensor
arm
muscles
imparts
to
it
a
peculiar
tone
gives
it
a
vast
variety
of
possible
activities
developing
many
alternatives
at
every
stage
and
tempts
to
many
undiscovered
forms
of
permanent
mayhem
its
struggle
is
usually
longer
and
less
interrupted
by
pauses
than
pugilism
and
its
situations
and
conclusions
often
develop
slowly
so
that
all
in
all
its
character
among
contests
is
unique
as
a
school
of
posture
for
art
its
varieties
are
extremely
manifold
and
by
no
means
developed
for
it
contains
every
kind
of
emphasis
of
every
part
and
calls
out
every
muscle
group
and
attitude
of
the
human
body
hence
its
training
is
most
generic
and
least
specialized
and
victories
have
been
won
by
very
many
kinds
of

perhaps
nothing
is
more
opposed
to
the
idea
of
a
gentleman
than
the
animi
fierce
tempest
of
the
soul
of
anger
a
testy
quarrelsome
mucky
humor
is
antisocial
and
an
outburst
of
rage
is
repulsive
even
turning
the
other
cheek
has
its
victories
and
may
be
a
method
of
moral
combat
a
strong
temper
well
controlled
and
kept
in
leash
makes
a
kinetic
character
but
in
view
of
bullying
unfair
play
cruel
injustice
to
the
weak
and
defenseless
of
outrageous
wrong
that
the
law
can
not
reach
patience
and
forbearance
may
cease
to
be
virtues
and
summary
redress
may
have
a
distinct
advantage
to
the
ethical
nature
of
man
and
to
social
order
and
the
strenuous
soul
must
fight
or
grow
stagnant
or
flabby
if
too
repressed
righteous
indignation
may
turn
to
sourness
and
sulks
and
the
disposition
be
spoiled
hence
the
relief
and
exhilaration
of
an
outbreak
that
often
clears
the
psychic
atmosphere
like
a
thunderstorm
and
gives
the
peace
that
passeth
understanding
so
often
dilated
on
by
our
correspondents
rather
than
the
abject
fear
of
making
enemies
whatever
the
provocation
i
would
praise
those
whose
best
title
of
honor
is
the
kind
of
enemies
they
make
better
even
an
occasional
nose
dented
by
a
fist
a
broken
bone
a
face
or
even
sometimes
the
sacrifice
of
the
life
of
one
of
our
best
academic
youth
than
stagnation
general
cynicism
and
censoriousness
bodily
and
psychic
cowardice
and
moral
corruption
if
this
indeed
be
as
it
sometimes
is
its
real
alternative
so
closely
are
love
and
war
connected
that
not
only
is
individual
pugnacity
greatly
increased
at
the
period
of
sexual
maturity
when
animals
acquire
or
develop
horns
fangs
claws
spurs
and
weapons
of
offense
and
defense
but
a
new
spirit
of
organization
arises
which
makes
teams
possible
or
more
permanent
football
baseball
cricket
and
even
boating
can
become
schools
of
mental
and
moral
training
first
the
rules
of
the
game
are
often
intricate
and
to
master
and
observe
them
effectively
is
no
mean
training
for
the
mind
controlling
the
body
these
are
steadily
being
revised
and
improved
and
the
reasons
for
each
detail
of
construction
and
conduct
of
the
game
require
experience
and
insight
into
human
nature
then
the
subordination
of
each
member
to
the
whole
and
to
a
leader
cultivates
the
social
and
coöperative
instincts
while
the
honor
of
the
school
college
or
city
which
each
team
represents
is
confided
to
each
and
all
group
loyalty
in
games
which
shows
such
a
marked
increment
in
coördination
and
at
the
dawn
of
puberty
as
to
constitute
a
distinct
change
in
the
character
of
sports
at
this
age
can
be
so
utilized
as
to
develop
a
spirit
of
service
and
devotion
not
only
to
town
country
and
race
but
to
god
and
the
church
self
must
be
merged
and
a
sportsmanlike
spirit
cultivated
that
prefers
defeat
to
tricks
and
secret
practise
and
a
clean
game
to
the
applause
of
rooters
and
fans
intent
only
on
victory
however
won
the
long
hard
fight
against
professionalism
that
brings
in
husky
muckers
who
by
every
rule
of
true
courtesy
and
chivalry
belong
outside
academic
circles
scrapping
and
underhand
advantages
is
a
sad
comment
on
the
character
and
spirit
of
these
games
and
eliminates
the
best
of
their
educational
advantages
the
necessity
of
intervention
which
has
imposed
such
great
burdens
on
faculties
and
brought
so
much
friction
with
the
frenzy
of
scholastic
sentiment
in
the
hot
stage
of
seasonal
enthusiasms
when
fanned
to
a
white
heat
by
the
excessive
interest
of
friends
and
patrons
and
the
injurious
exploitation
of
the
press
bears
sad
testimony
to
the
strength
and
persistence
of
warlike
instincts
from
our
heredity
but
even
thus
the
good
far
predominates
the
elective
system
has
destroyed
the
class
games
and
our
institutions
have
no
units
like
the
english
colleges
to
be
pitted
against
each
other
and
so
colleges
grow
an
ever
smaller
percentage
of
students
obtain
the
benefit
of
practise
on
the
teams
while
electioneering
methods
often
place
men
in
place
of
the
best
but
both
students
and
teachers
are
slowly
learning
wisdom
in
the
dear
school
of
experience
on
the
whole
there
is
less
license
in
breaking
training
and
in
celebrating
victories
and
even
at
their
worst
good
probably
predominates
while
the
progress
of
recent
years
bids
us
hope
finally
military
ideals
and
methods
of
education
are
helpful
regulations
of
the
appetite
for
combat
and
on
the
whole
more
wholesome
and
robust
than
those
which
are
merely
esthetic
marching
in
step
gives
proper
and
uniform
movement
of
legs
arms
and
carriage
of
body
the
manual
of
arms
with
evolution
and
involution
of
figures
in
the
ranks
gives
each
a
corporate
feeling
of
membership
and
involves
care
of
personal
appearance
and
accouterments
while
the

and
especially
the

adolescent
of
the
lower

the
two
or
three
years
of
compulsory
military
service
is
often
compared
to
an
academic
course
and
the

and
even
an

or

and
a
few
exterior
features
of
soldierly
life
all
give
a
distinct
character
to
the
spirit
of
any
institution
the
very
fancy
of
being
in
any
sense
a
soldier
opens
up
a
new
range
of
interests
too
seldom
utilized
and
tactics
army
life

military
history

patriotism
the
flag
and

should
always
erect
a
new
standard
of

youth
should
embrace
every
opportunity
that
offers
in
this
line
and
instruction
should
greatly
increase
the
intellectual
opportunities
created
by
every
interest
in
warfare
it
would
be
easy
to
create
pregnant
courses
on
how
soldiers
down
the
course
of
history
have
lived
thought
felt
fought
and
died
how
great
battles
were
won
and
what
causes
triumphed
in
them
and
to
generalize
many
of
the
best
things
taught
in
detail
in
the
best
schools
of
war
in
different
grades
and
lands
a
subtle
but
potent
intersexual
influence
is
among
the
strongest
factors
of

male
birds
and

show
off
their
charms
of
beauty
and
accomplishment
in
many
a
liturgy
of
love
antics
in
the
presence
of
the
female
this
instinct
seems
somehow
continuous
with
the
growth
of
ornaments
in
the
mating
season
song
tumbling
balking
mock
fights
are
forms
of
animal
courtship
the
boy
who
turns
cartwheels
past
the
home
of
the
girl
of
his
fancy
is
brilliant
brave
witty
erect
strong
in
her
presence
and
elsewhere
dull
and
commonplace
enough
illustrates
the
same
principle
the
true
as
seen
in
the
south
is
perhaps
the
purest
expression
of
this
impulse
to
courtship
antics
seen
in
man
but
its
irradiations
are
many
and
pervasive
the
presence
of
the
fair
sex
gives
tonicity
to
muscles
and
tension
to
his
arteries
to
a
degree
of
which
he
is
rarely
conscious
defeat
in
all
contests
is
more
humiliating
and
victory
more
glorious
thereby
each
sex
is
constantly
passing
the
examination
of
the
other
and
each
judges
the
other
by
standards
different
from
its
own
alas
for
the
young
people
who
are
not
different
with
the
other
sex
from
what
they
are
with
their
own
and
some
are
transformed
into
different
beings
achievement
proclaims
ability
to
support
defend
bring
credit
and
even
fame
to
the
object
of
future
choice
and
no
good
point
is
lost
physical
force
and
skill
and
above
all
victory
and
glory
make
a
hero
and
invest
him
with
a
romantic
glamour
which
even
though
concealed
by
conventionality
or
etiquette
is
profoundly
felt
and
makes
the
winner
more
or
less
irresistible
the
applause
of
men
and
of
mates
is
sweet
and
even
intoxicating
but
that
of
ladies
is
ravishing
by
universal
acclaim
the
fair
belong
to
the
brave
strong
and
victorious
this
stimulus
is
wholesome
and
refining
as
is
shown
later
a
bashful
youth
often
selects
a
maiden
onlooker
and
is
sometimes
quite
unconsciously
dominated
in
his
every
movement
by
a
sense
of
her
presence
stranger
and
apparently
unnoticed
though
she
be
although
in
the
intellectual
work
of
coeducation
girls
are
most
influenced
thus
in
athletics
this
motive
makes
for
refinement
and
good
form
the
ideal
knight
however
fierce
and
terrible
must
not
be
brutal
but
show
capacity
for
fine
feeling
tenderness
magnanimity
and
forbearance
evolutionists
tell
us
that
woman
has
domesticated
and
educated
savage
man
and
taught
him
all
his
virtues
by
exercising
her
royal
prerogative
of
selecting
in
her
mate
just
those
qualities
that
pleased
her
for
transmission
to
future
generations
and
eliminating
others
distasteful
to
her
if
so
she
is
still
engaged
in
this
work
as
much
as
ever
and
in
his
dull
slow
way
man
feels
that
her
presence
enforces
her
standards
abhorrent
though
it
would
be
to
him
to
compromise
in
one
iota
his
masculinity
most
plays
and
games
in
which
both
sexes
participate
have
some
of
the
advantages
with
some
of
the
disadvantages
of
coeducation
where
both
are
partners
rather
than
antagonists
there
is
less
eviration
a
gallant
man
would
do
his
best
to
help
but
his
worst
not
to
beat
a
lady
thus
in
general
the
latter
performs
her
best
in
her
true
rule
of
sympathetic
spectator
rather
than
as
fellow
player
and
is
now
an
important
factor
in
the
physical
education
of
adolescents
how
pervasive
this
femininity
is
which
is
slowly
transforming
our
schools
is
strikingly
seen
in
the
church
gulick
holds
that
the
reason
why
only
some
seven
per
cent
of
the
young
men
of
the
country
are
in
the
churches
while
most
members
and
workers
are
women
is
that
the
qualities
demanded
are
the
feminine
ones
of
love
rest
prayer
trust
desire
for
fortitude
to
endure
a
sense
of
atonement
traits
not

by

the
exercise
of

is
unique
in
that

are

overcomes

encounters
its
chief
obstacles
in
the
most
crowded
and
slum
districts
where
its
greatest
value
and
success
was
expected
for
boys
in
the
early
teens
who
without
supervision
are
prone
to
commit
abuses
upon
property
and
upon
younger
children
and
are
so
disorderly
as
to
make

nuisance

resent

lee
sees
the
arboreal
instincts
of
our
progenitors
in
the
very
strong
propensity
of
boys
from
ten
to
fourteen
to
climb
in
any
form
to
use
traveling
rings
generally
occupied
constantly
to
their
fullest
extent
to
jump
from
steps
and
catch
a
swinging
trapeze
to
go
up
a
ladder
and
slide
down
poles
to
use
horizontal
and
parallel
bars
the
city
boy
has
plenty
of
daring
at
this
age
but
does
not
know
what
he
can
do
and
needs
more
supervision
than
the
country
youth
the
young
tough
is
commonly
present
and
though
admired
and
copied
by
younger
boys
it
is
perhaps
as
often
for
his
heroic
as
for
his
bad
traits
sargent
and
others
have
well
pointed
out
that
athletics
afford
a
wealth
of
new
and
profitable
topics
for
discussion
and
enthusiasm
which
helps
against
the
triviality
and
mental
vacuity
into
which
the
intercourse
of
students
is
prone
to
lapse
it
prompts
to
discussion
of
diet
and
regimen
it
gives
a
new
standard
of
honor
for
a
member
of
a
team
to
break
training
would
bring
reprobation
and
ostracism
for
he
is
set
apart
to
win
fame
for
his
class
or
college
it
supplies
a
splendid
motive
against
all
errors
and
vices
that
weaken
or
corrupt
the
body
it
is
a
wholesome
vent
for
the
reckless
courage
that
would
otherwise
go
to
disorder
or
riotous
excess
it
supplies
new
and
advantageous
topics
for
compositions
and
for
terse
vigorous
and
idiomatic
is
a
great
aid
to
discipline
teaches
respect
for
deeds
rather
than
words
or
promises
lays
instructors
under
the
necessity
of
being
more
interesting
that
their
work
be
not
jejune
or
dull

contrast

the
business
side
of
managing
great
contests
has
been
an
admirable
school
for
training
young
men
to
conduct
great
and
difficult
financial
operations
sometimes
involving
or
more
and
has
thus
prepared
some
for
successful
careers
it
furnishes
now
the
closest
of
all
links
between
high
school
and
college
reduces
the
number
of
those
physically
unfit
for
college
and
should
give
education
generally
a
more
real
and
vigorous
ideal
its
obvious
dangers
are
distraction
from
study
and
overestimation
of
the
value
of
victory
especially
in
the
artificial
glamours
which
the
press
and
the
popular
furor
give
to
great
games
unsportsmanlike
secret
tricks
and
methods
of
combative
and
too
stalwart
impulses
and
a
disposition
to
carry
things
by
storm
by
tactics
friction
with
faculties
and
censure
or
neglect
of
instructors
who
take
unpopular
sides
on

culminating
in
excessive
strain
for

with
alternations
of

of

and
in
some
cases
premature
features
of
senility
in

life
undergrowth
of
the
accessory
motor
parts
and
powers
and
erethic
diathesis
that
makes

seem
monotonous
dull
and
boresome
the
propensity
to
codify
sports
to
standardize
the
weight
and
size
of
their
implements
and
to
reduce
them
to
what
spencer
calls
regimentation
is
a
outcrop
of
uniformitarianism
that
works
against
that
individuation
which
is
one
of
the
chief
advantages
of
free
play
this
to
be
sure
has
developed
rounders
to
modern
baseball
and
this
is
well
but
it
is
seen
in
the
elaborate
draconian
laws
diplomacy
judicial
and
legislative
procedures
concerning
eligibility
transfer
and
even
sale
of
players
in
some
games
international
conformity
is
gravely
discussed
even
where
there
is
no
tyranny
and
oppression
good

is
steadily
hampering
nature
and
the
free
play
of
personality
togs
and
targets
balls
and
bats
rackets
and
oars
are
graded
or
numbered
weighed
and
measured
and
every
emergency
is
legislated
on
and
judged
by
an
autocratic
martinet
jealous
of
every
prerogative
and
conscious
of
his
dignity
all
this
separates
games
from
the
majority
and
makes
for
specialism
and
professionalism
not
only
this
but
men
are
coming
to
be
sized
up
for
hereditary
fitness
in
each
point
and
for
each
sport
runners
sprinters
and
jumpers
we
are
told
on
the
basis
of
many
careful
measurements
must
be
tall
with
slender
bodies
narrow
but
deep
chests
longer
legs
than
the
average
for
their
height
the
lower

being
especially
long
with
small
calf
ankle
and
feet
small
arms
narrow
hips
with
great
power
of
thoracic
inflation
and
thighs
of
small
girth
every
player
must
be
studied
by
trainers
for
ever
finer
individual
adjustments
his
dosage
of
work
must
be
kept
well
within
the
limits
of
his
vitality
and
be
carefully
adjusted
to
his
recuperative
power
his
personal
nascent
periods
must
be
noted
and
initial
embarrassment
carefully
weeded
out
the
field
of
play
is
as
wide
as
life
and
its
varieties
far
outnumber
those
of
industries
and
occupations
in
the
census
plays
and
games
differ
in
seasons
sex
and
age
mcghee
has
shown
on
the
basis
of
some
children
that
running
plays
are
pretty
constant
for
boys
from
six
to
seventeen
but
that
girls
are
always
far
behind
boys
and
run
steadily
less
from
eight
to
eighteen
in
games
of
choice
boys
showed
a
slight
rise
at
sixteen
and
seventeen
and
girls
a
rapid
increase
at
eleven
and
a
still
more
rapid
one
after
sixteen
in
games
of
imitation
girls
excel
and
show
a
marked
as
boys
do
a
slight
pubescent
fall
in
those
games
involving
rivalry
boys
at
first
greatly
excel
girls
but
are
overtaken
by
the
latter
in
the
eighteenth
year
both
showing
marked
pubescent
increment
girls
have
the
largest
number
of
plays
and
specialise
on
a
few
less
than
boys
and
most
of
these
plays
are
of
the
unorganized
kinds
johnson
selected
from
a
far
larger
number
plays
and
games
and
arranged
the
best
of
them
in
a
course
by
school
grades
from
the
first
to
the
eighth
inclusive
and
also
according
to
their
educational
value
as
teaching
observation
reading
and
spelling
language
arithmetic
geography
history
and
biography
physical
training
and
specifically
as
training
legs
hand
arm
back
waist
abdominal
muscles
chest
etc
most
of
our
best
games
are
very
old
and
johnson
thinks
have
deteriorated
but
children
are
imitative
and
not
inventive
in
their
games
and
easily
learn
new
ones
since
the
berlin
play
congress
in
the
sentiment
has
grown
that
these
are
of
national
importance
and
are
preferable
to
gymnastics
both
for
soul
and
body
hence
we
have
teachers
yards
and
courses
both
for
their
own
value
and
also
to
turn
on
the
play
impulse
to
aid
in
the
drudgery
of
school
work
several
have
thought
that
a
liberal
education
could
be
given
by
plays
and
games
alone
on
the
principle
that
there
is
no
profit
where
there
is
no
pleasure
or
true
euphoria
play
is
motor
poetry
too
early
distinction
between
play
and
work
should
not
be
taught
education
perhaps
should
really
begin
with
directing
childish
sports
aright
froebel
thought
it
the
purest
and
most
spiritual
activity
of
childhood
the
germinal
leaves
of
all
later
life
schooling
that
lacks
recreation
favors
dulness
for
play
makes
the
mind
alert
and
its
joy
helps
all
anabolic
activities
says
brinton
the
measure
of
value
of
work
is
the
amount
of
play
there
is
in
it
and
the
measure
of
value
of
play
is
the
amount
of
work
there
is
in
it
johnson
adds
that
it
is
doubtful
if
a
great
man
ever
accomplished
his
life
work
without
having
reached
a
play
interest
in
it
sully
deplores
the
increase
of
agolasts
or
in
our
times
in
merry
old
england
every
one
played
games
and
laughter
their
natural
accompaniment
abounded
queen
maids
of
honor
played
tag
with
hilarity
but
the
spirit
of
play
with
full
abandon
seems
taking
its
departure
from
our
overworked
serious
and
tons
age
to
requote
stevenson
with
variation
as
to
labor
so
et
joculari
orare
to
play
and
to
jest
are
to
pray
laughter
itself
as
kühne
long
ago
showed
is
one
of
the
most
precious
forms
of
exercise
relieving
the
arteries
of
their
tension
the
antithesis
between
play
and
work
is
generally
wrongly
conceived
for
the
difference
is
essentially
in
the
degree
of
strength
of
the
motivations
the
young
often
do
their
hardest
work
in
play
with
interest
the
most
repellent
tasks
become
pure
sport
as
in
the
case
johnson
reports
of
a
man
who
wanted
a
pile
of
stone
thrown
into
a
ditch
and
by
kindling
a
fire
in
the
ditch
and
pretending
the
stones
were
buckets
of
water
the
heavy
and
job
was
done
by
tired
boys
with
shouting
and
enthusiasm
play
from
one
aspect
of
it
is
superfluous
energy
over
and
above
what
is
necessary
to
digest
breathe
keep
the
heart
and
organic
processes
going
and
most
children
who
can
not
play
if
they
have
opportunity
can
neither
study
nor
work
without
overdrawing
their
resources
of
vitality
bible
psychology
conceives
the
fall
of
man
as
the
necessity
of
doing
things
without
zest
and
this
is
not
only
ever
repeated
but
now
greatly
emphasized
when
youth
leaves
the
sheltered
paradise
of
play
to
grind
in
the
mills
of
modern
industrial
civilization
the
curse
is
overcome
only
by
those
who
come
to
love
their
tasks
and
redeem
their
toil
again
to
play
play
hardly
less
than
work
can
be
to
utter
exhaustion
and
because
it
draws
upon
older
stores
and
strata
of
impulsion
its
exhaustion
may
even
more
completely
drain
our
kinetic
resources
if
it
is
too
abandoned
or
prolonged
play
can
do
just
as
hard
and
painful
tasks
as
work
for
what
we
love
is
done
with
whole
and
undivided
personality
work
as
too
often
conceived
is
all
body
and
no
soul
and
makes
for
duality
and
not
totality
its
constraint
is
external
mechanical
or
it
works
by
fear
and
not
love
not
effort
but
zestless
endeavor
is
the
tragedy
of
life
interest
and
play
are
one
and
inseparable
as
body
and
soul
duty
itself
is
not
adequately
conceived
and
felt
if
it
is
not
pleasure
and
is
generally
too
feeble
and
fitful
in
the
young
to
awaken
much
energy
or
duration
of
action
play
is
from
within
from
congenital
hereditary
impulsion
it
is
the
best
of
all
methods
of
organizing
instincts
its
cathartic
or
purgative
function
regulates
irritability
which
may
otherwise
be
drained
or
vented
in
wrong
directions
exactly
as
breuer
shows
psychic
traumata
may
if
overtense
result
in
hysterical
convulsions
it
is
also
the
best
form
of
and
its
advantage
is
variability
following
the
impulsion
of
the
idle
perhaps
hyperemic
and
overnourished
centers
most
ready
to
act
it
involves
play
illusion
and
is
the
great
agent
of
unity
and
totalization
of
body
and
soul
while
its
social
function
develops
solidarity
and
unison
of
action
between
individuals
the
dances
feasts
and
games
of
primitive
people
wherein
they
rehearse
hunting
and
war
and
act
and
dance
out
their
legends
bring
individuals
and
tribes
together
work
is
menial
cheerless
grinding
regular
and
requires
more
precision
and
accuracy
and
because
attended
with
less
ease
and
pleasure
and
economy
of
movement
is
more
liable
to
produce
erratic
habits
antagonistic
as
the
forms
often
are
it
may
be
that
as
carr
says
we
may
sometimes
so
suffuse
work
with
the
play
spirit
and
that
the
present
distinction
between
work
and
play
will
vanish
the
transition
will
be
less
tragic
and
the
activities
of
youth
will
be
slowly
systematised
into
a
whole
that
better
fits
his
nature
and
needs
or
if
not
this
we
may
at
least
find
the
true
proportion
and
system
between
drudgery
and
recreation
the
worst
product
of
striving
to
do
things
with
defective
psychic
impulsion
is
fatigue
in
its
common
forms
which
slows
down
the
pace
multiplies
errors
and
inaccuracies
and
develops
slovenly
habits
ennui
flitting
will
specters
velleities
and
caprices
and
neurasthenic
symptoms
generally
it
brings
restlessness
and
a
tendency
to
many
little
heterogeneous
smattering
efforts
that
weaken
the
will
and
leave
the
mind
like
a
piece
of
blotting
paper
covered
with
traces
and
nothing
legible
all
beginnings
are
easy
and
only
as
we
leave
the
early
stages
of
proficiency
behind
and
press
on
in
either
physical
or
mental
culture
and
encounter
difficulties
do
individual
differences
and
the
tendency
of
weak
will
to
change
and
turn
to
something
else
increase
perhaps
the
greatest
disparity
between
men
is
the
power
to
make
a
long
concentrative
persevering
effort
for
der

the
master
shows
himself
in
limitation
now
no
kind
or
line
of
culture
is
complete
till
it
issues
in
motor
habits
and
makes
a
soul
texture
that
admits
concentration
series
in
many
directions
and
that
can
bring
all
its
resources
to
bear
at
any
point
the
brain
unorganized
by
training
has
to
recur
to
richter
aphorism
saltpeter
sulfur
and
charcoal
or
all
the
ingredients
of
gunpowder
but
never
makes
a
grain
of
it
because
they
never
get
together
thus
willed
action
is
the
language
of
complete
men
and
the
goal
of
education
when
things
are
mechanized
by
right
habituation
there
is
still
further
gain
for
not
only
is
the
mind
freed
for
further
and
higher
work
but
this
deepest
stratum
of
motor
association
is
a
plexus
that
determines
not
only
conduct
and
character
but
even
beliefs
the
person
who
deliberates
is
lost
if
the
intellect
that
doubts
and
weighs
alternatives
is
less
completely
organised
than
habits
all
will
culture
is
intensive
and
should
safeguard
us
against
the
chance
influence
of
life
and
the
insidious
danger
of
great
ideas
in
small
and
feeble
minds
now
fatigue
personal
and
perhaps
racial
is
just
what
arrests
in
the
incomplete
and
mere
memory
or
noetic
stage
it
makes
weak
bodies
that
command
and
not
strong
ones
that
obey
it
divorces
knowing
and
doing
and
a
separation
which
the
greeks
could
not
conceive
because
for
them
knowledge
ended
in
skill
or
was
exemplified
in
precepts
and
proverbs

but
all
really
useless
knowledge
tends
to
be
eliminated
as
error
or
superstition
the
roots
of
play
lie
close
to
those
of
creative
imagination
and
idealism
the
opposite
extreme
is
the
factitious
and
superficial
motivation
of
fear
prizes
examinations
artificial
and
immediate
rewards
and
penalties
which
can
only
tattoo
the
mind
and
body
with
conventional
patterns
pricked
in
but
which
lead
an
unreal
life
in
the
soul
because
they
have
no
depth
of
soil
in
nature
or
heredity
however
precious
and
coherent
in
themselves
all
thus
organized
are
mere
lugs
crimps
and
frills
all
such
culture
is
spurious
unreal
and
parasitic
it
may
make
a
scholastic
or
sophistic
mind
but
a
worm
is
at
the
root
and
with
a
dim
sense
of
the
vanity
of
all
knowledge
that
does
not
become
a
rule
of
life
some
form
of
pessimism
is
sure
to
supervene
in
every
serious
soul
with

a
civilization
accumulates
such
impedimenta
traditional
flotsam

race
fatigue
proceeds
with
equal
step
with
its
increasing
volume
immediate
utilities
are
better
but
yet
not
so
much
better
than
acquisitions
that
have
no
other
than
a
school
or
examination
value
if
as
ruskin
says
all
true
work
is
praise
all
true
play
is
love
and
prayer
instil
into
a
boy
soul
learning
which
he
sees
and
feels
not
to
have
the
highest
worth
and
which
can
not
become
a
part
of
his
active
life
and
increase
it
and
his
freshness
spontaneity
and
the
fountains
of
play
slowly
run
dry
in
him
and
his
youth
fades
to
early
desiccation
the
instincts
feelings
intuitions
the
work
of
which
is
always
play
are
superseded
by
method
grind
and
education
by
instruction
which
is
only
an
effort
to
repair
the
defects
of
heredity
for
which
at
its
best
it
is
vulgar
pinchbeck
substitute
the
best
play
is
true
genius
which
always
comes
thus
into

has
this
way
of

abnormal

increased
it
from

cent
while
the
time
of
year
and
precipitation
seemed
to
have
almost
no
effect
while
the
effect
of
weather
has
been
generally
recognized
by
superintendents
and
teachers
and
directors
of
prisons
and
asylums
and
even
by
banks
which
in
london
do
not
permit
clerks
to
do
the
more
important
bookkeeping
during
very
foggy
days
the
statistical
estimates
of
its
effect
in
general

more
valuable
determinations
temperature
is
known
to
have

distinct

suicide

truancy
workmen
do
less
in
bad

etc
in
his
study
of
truancy
kline
starts
with
the
assumption
that
the
maximum
metabolism
is
always
consciously
or
unconsciously
sought
and
that
migrations
are
generally
away
from
the
extremes
of
hot
and
cold
toward
an
optimum
temperature
the
curve
of
truancies
and
runaways
increases
in
a
marked
ratio
at
puberty
which
probably
represents
the
age
of
natural
majority
among
primitive
people
dislike
of
school
the
passion
for
life
and
more
universal
interests
in
man
and
nature
now
arise
so
that
runaways
may
be
interpreted
as
an
instinctive
rebellion
against
limitations
of
freedom
and
unnatural
methods
of
education
as
well
as
against
poor
homes
hunger
is
one
of
its
most
potent
although
often
unconscious
causes
the
habitual
environment
now
begins
to
seem
dull
and
there
is
a
great
increase
in
impatience
at
restraint
sometimes
there
is
a
mania
for
simply
going
away
and
enjoying
the
liberty
of
nomadic
life
just
as
good
people
in
foreign
parts
sometimes
allow
themselves
unwonted
liberties
so
vagrancy
increases
crime
the
passion
to
get
to
and
play
at
or
in
the
water
is
often
strangely
dominant
it
seems
so
fine
out
of
doors
especially
in
the
spring
and
the
woods
and
fields
make
it
so
hard
to
voluntarily
incarcerate
oneself
in
the
schoolroom
that
pubescent
boys
and
even
girls
often
feel
like
animals
in
captivity
they
long
intensely
for
the
utter
abandon
of
a
wilder
life
and
very
characteristic
is
the
frequent
discarding
of
foot
and
head
dress
and
even
garments
in
the
blind
instinct
to
realise
again
the
conditions
of
primitive
man
the
manifestations
of
this
impulse
if
read
aright
are
grave
arraignments
of
the
lack
of
adaptability
of
the
environment
to
his
disposition
and
nature
and
with
home
restraints
once
broken
the
liabilities
to
every
crime
especially
theft
are
enormously
increased
the
truant
although
a
cording
to
measurements
slightly
smaller
than
the
average
child
is
more
energetic
and
is
generally
capable
of
the
greatest
activity
and
usefulness
in
more
vocations
truancy
is
augmented
too
just
in
proportion
as
legitimate
and
interesting
physical
exercise
is
denied
the
vagrant
itinerant
vagabond
gadabout
hobo
and
tramp
that
riis
has
made
so
interesting
is
an
arrested
degenerate
or
perverted
being
who
abhors
work
feels
that
the
world
owes
him
a
living
and
generally
has
his
first
real
nomad
experience
in
the
teens
or
earlier
it
is
a
chronic
illusion
of
youth
that
gives
elsewhere
a
special
charm
in
the
immediate
present
things
are
mean
dulled
by
wont
and
perhaps
even
nauseating
because
of
familiarity
there
must
be
a
change
of
scene
to
see
the
world
man
is
not
sessile
but
locomotor
and
the
moment
his
life
becomes
migratory
all
the
restraints
and
responsibilities
of
settled
life
vanish
it
is
possible
to
steal
and
pass
on
undiscovered
and
unsuspected
and
to
steal
again
the
vagabond
escapes
the
control
of
public
sentiment
which
normally
is
an
external
conscience
and
having
none
of
his
own
within
him
thus
lapses
to
a
feral
state
the
constraint
of
city
home
and
school
is
especially
irksome
and
if
to
this
repulsion
is
added
the
attraction
of
a
love
of
nature
and
of
perpetual
change
we
have
the
diathesis
of
the
roadsman
already
developed
adolescence
is
the
normal
time
of
emancipation
from
the
parental
roof
when
youth
seeks
to
set
up
a
home
of
its
own
but
the
apprentice
to
life
must
wander
far
and
long
enough
to
find
the
best
habitat
in
which
to
set
up
for
himself
this
is
the
spring
season
of
emigration
and
it
should
be
an
indispensable
part
of
every
life
curriculum
just
before
settlement
to
travel
far
and
wide
if
resources
and
inclination
permit
but
this
stage
should
end
in
wisely
chosen
settlement
where
the
young
life
can
be
independently
developed
and
that
with
more
complacency
and
satisfaction
because
the
place
has
been
wisely
chosen
on
the
basis
of
a
wide
comparison
the
chronic
vagrant
has
simply
failed
to
develop
the
reductives
of
this
normal
stage
crime
is
cryptogamous
and
flourishes
in
concealment
so
that
not
only
does
falsehood
facilitate
it
but
certain
types
of
lies
often
cause
and
are
caused
by
it
the
beginning
of
wisdom
in
treatment
is
to
discriminate
between
good
and
bad
lies
my
own
study
of
the
lies
of
normal
children
by
a
method
carefully
devised
in
order
to
avoid
all
indelicacy
to
the
childish
consciousness
suggested
the
following
distinct
species
of
lies
it
is
often
a
epoch
when
the
young
child
first
learns
that
it
can
imagine
and
state
things
that
have
no
objective
counterpart
in
its
life
and
there
is
often
a
weird
intoxication
when
some
absurd
and
monstrous
statement
is
made
while
the
first
sensation
of
a
deliberate
break
with
truth
causes
a
real
excitement
which
is
often
the
birth
pang
of
the
imagination
more
commonly
this
is
seen
in
childish
play
which
owes
a
part
of
its
charm
to
children
make
believe
they
are
animals
doctors
ogres
play
school
that
they
are
dead
mimic
all
they
see
and
hear
idealising
temperaments
sometimes
prompt
children
of
three
or
four
suddenly
to
assert
that
they
saw
a
pig
with
five
ears
apples
on
a
cherry
tree
and
other
munchausen
wonders
which
really
means
merely
that
they
have
had
a
new
mental
combination
independently
of
experience
sometimes
their
fancy
is
almost
visualisation
and
develops
into
a
kind
of
mythopeic
faculty
which
spins
clever
yarns
and
suggests
in
a
sense
quite
as
pregnant
as
froschmer
asserts
of
all
mental
activity
and
of
the
universe
itself
that
all
their
life
is
imagination
its
control
and
not
its
elimination
in
a
gradgrind
age
of
crass
facts
is
what
should
be
sought
in
the
interests
of
the
highest
truthfulness
and
of
the
evolution
of
thought
as
something
above
reality
which
prepares
the
way
for
imaginative
literature
the
life
of
hartley
coleridge
by
his
brother
is
one
of
many
illustrations
he
fancied
cataract
of
what
he
named
would
burst
out
in
a
certain
field
and
flow
between
populous
banks
where
an
ideal
government
long
wars
and
even
a
reform
in
spelling
would
prevail
illustrated
in
a
journal
devoted
to
the
affairs
of
this
realm
all
these
developed
in
his
imagination
where
they
existed
with
great
reality
for
years
the
vividness
of
this
fancy
resembles
the
of
kandinsky
two
sisters
used
to
say
let
us
play
we
are
sisters
as
if
this
made
the
relation
more
real
cagliostro
found
adolescent
boys
particularly
apt
for
training
for
his
exhibition
of
phrenological
impostures
illustrating
his
faculties
he
lied
when
he
confessed
he
had
lied
said
a
young
sancho
panza
who
had
believed
the
wild
tales
of
another
boy
who
later
admitted
their
falsity
sir
james
mackintosh
near
puberty
after
reading
roman
history
used
to
fancy
himself
the
emperor
of
constantinople
and
carried
on
the
administration
of
the
realm
for
hours
at
a
time
his
fancies
never
quite
became
convictions
but
adolescence
is
the
golden
age
of
this
kind
of
dreamery
and
reverie
which
supplements
reality
and
totalizes
our
faculties
and
often
gives
a
special
charm
to
dramatic
activities
and
in
morbid
cases
to
simulation
and
dissimulation
it
is
a
state
from
which
some
of
the
bad
but
far
more
of
the
good
qualities
of
life
and
mind
arise
these
are
the
noble
lies
of
poetry
art
and
idealism
but
their
pedagogic
regime
must
be
wise
again
with
children
as
with
savages
truth
depends
largely
upon
personal
likes
and
dislikes
truth
is
for
friends
and
lies
are
felt
to
be
quite
right
for
enemies
the
young
often
see
no
wrong
in
lies
their
friends
wish
told
but
may
collapse
and
confess
when
asked
if
they
would
have
told
their
mother
thus
boys
best
keep
up
complotted
lies
and
are
surer
to
own
up
if
caught
than
girls
it
is
harder
to
cheat
in
school
with
a
teacher
who
is
liked
friendships
are
cemented
by
confidences
and
secrets
and
when
they
wane
promises
not
to
tell
weaken
in
their
validity
lies
to
the
priest
and
above
all
to
god
are
the
worst
all
this
makes
special
attention
to
friendships
leaders
and
favorites
important
and
suggests
the
high
value
of
science
for
general
veracity
the
worst
lies
perhaps
are
those
of
selfishness
they
ease
children
over
many
hard
places
in
life
and
are
convenient
covers
for
weakness
and
vice
these
lies
are
on
the
whole
judging
from
our
census
most
prevalent
they
are
also
most
corrupting
and
hard
to
correct
all
bad
habits
particularly
predispose
to
the
lie
of
concealment
for
those
who
do
wrong
are
almost
certain
to
have
recourse
to
falsehood
and
the
sense
of
meanness
thus
slowly
bred
which
may
be
met
by
appeals
to
honor
for
so
much
of
which
school
life
is
responsible
is
often
mitigated
by
the
fact
that
falsehoods
are
frequently
resorted
to
in
moments
of
danger
and
excitement
are
easily
forgotten
when
it
is
over
and
rarely
rankle
these
even
more
than
the
pseudomaniac
cases
mentioned
later
grow
rankly
in
those
with
criminal
predispositions
the
lie
heroic
is
often
justified
as
a
means
of
noble
ends
youth
has
an
instinct
which
is
wholesome
for
viewing
moral
situations
as
wholes
callow
casualists
are
fond
of
declaring
that
it
would
be
a
duty
to
state
that
their
mother
was
out
when
she
was
in
if
it
would
save
her
life
although
they
perhaps
would
not
lie
to
save
their
own
a
doctor
many
suggested
might
tell
an
overanxious
patient
or
friend
that
there
was
hope
saving
his
conscience
perhaps
by
reflecting
that
there
was
hope
although
they
had
it
while
he
had
none
the
end
at
first
in
such
cases
may
be
very
noble
and
the
fib
or
quibble
very
petty
but
worse
lies
for
meaner
objects
may
follow
youth
often
describes
such
situations
with
exhilaration
as
if
there
were
a
feeling
of
easement
from
the
monotonous
and
tedious
obligation
of
rigorous
literal
veracity
and
here
mentors
are
liable
to
become
nervous
and
err
the
youth
who
really
gets
interested
in
the
conflict
of
duties
may
reverently
be
referred
to
the
inner
lie
of
his
own
conscience
the
need
of
keeping
which
as
a
private
tribunal
is
now
apparent
many
adolescents
become
craven
literalists
and
distinctly
morbid
and
pseudophobiac
regarding
every
deviation
from
scrupulously
literal
truth
as
alike
heinous
and
many
systematized
palliatives
and
casuistic
methods
of
whispering
or
silently
interpolating
the
words
not
perhaps
or
i
think
sometimes
said
over
hundreds
of
times
to
neutralize
the
guilt
of
intended
or
unintended
falsehoods
appear
in
our
records
as
a
sad
product
of
bad
methods
next
to
the
selfish
lie
for
protection
of
special
psychological
interest
for
adolescent
crime
is
what
we
may
call
pseudomania
seen
especially
in
pathological
girls
in
their
teens
who
are
honeycombed
with
selfishness
and
affectation
and
have
a
passion
for
always
acting
a
part
attracting
attention
etc
the
recent
literature
of
telepathy
and
hypnotism
furnishes
many
striking
examples
of
this
diathesis
of
impostors
of
both
sexes
it
is
a
strange
psychological
paradox
that
some
can
so
deliberately
prefer
to
call
black
white
and
find
distinct
inebriation
in
flying
diametrically
in
the
face
of
truth
and
fact
the
great
impostors
whose
entire
lives
have
been
a
fabric
of
lies
are
cases
in
point
they
find
a
distinct
pleasure
not
only
in
the
sense
of
power
which
their
ability
to
make
trouble
gives
but
in
the
sense
of
making
truth
a
lie
and
of
decreeing
things
into
and
out
of
existence
sheldon
interesting
statistics
show
that
among
the
institutional
activities
of
american
children
predatory
organizations
culminate
from
eleven
to
fifteen
and
are
chiefly
among
boys
these
include
bands
of
robbers
clubs
for
hunting
and
fishing
play
armies
organized
fighting
bands
between
separate
districts
associations
for

etc
this
form
of
association
is
the
typical
one
for
boys
of
twelve
after
this
age
their
interests
are
gradually
transferred
to

normally
reduced
at
the
beginning
of
the

and
their
energy
worked
off
into

they

alone
becomes
dangerous
when
he
hunts
with

he
is
ambitious
to
get
pinched
or
arrested
and
to
pose
as
a
hero
his
vanity
may
obliterate

fear
and
custom
as
his
mind
becomes
inflamed
with
flash

and
penny
dreadfuls
sometimes
whole

are
terrorized
so
that
no

dares
to

learn

emulate

and
this
is
one
cause
of
epidemics
in
crime
they

love
boundless
independence
are
sometimes
very
susceptible
to

influence
if
applied
with
great
wisdom
and
discretion
but
easily
fall
away
what
is
the
true
moral
antitoxin
for
this
class
or
at
least
what
is
the
and
how
and
when
to
pull
it
we
are
now
just
beginning
to
learn
but
it
is
a
new
specialty
in
the
great
work
of
salvage
from
the
wreckage
of
city
life
in
london
where
these
groups
are
better
organised
and
yet
more
numerous
war
is
often
waged
between
them
weapons
are
used
and
murder
is
not
so
very
infrequent
normally
this
instinct
passes
harmlessly
over
into
associations
for
physical
training
which
furnishes
a
safe
outlet
for
these
instincts
until
the
reductives
of
maturer
years
have
perfected
their
work
the
causation
of
crime
which
the
cure
seeks
to
remove
is
a
problem
comparable
with
the
origin
of
sin
and
evil
first
of
course
comes
heredity
bad
antenatal
conditions
bad
homes
unhealthful
infancy
and
childhood
overcrowded
slums
with
their
promiscuity
and
squalor
which
are
always
near
the
border
of
lawlessness
and
perhaps
are
the
chief
cause
of
crime
a
large
per
cent
of
juvenile
offenders
variously
estimated
but
probably
of
all
are
vagrants
or
without
homes
and
divorce
of
parents
and
illegitimacy
seem
to
be
nearly
equal
as
causative
agencies
if
whatever
is
physiologically
wrong
is
morally
wrong
and
whatever
is
physiologically
right
is
morally
right
we
have
an
important
ethical
suggestion
from
somatic
conditions
there
is
no
doubt
that
conscious
intelligence
during
a
certain
early
stage
of
its
development
tends
to
deteriorate
the
strength
and
infallibility
of
instinctive
processes
so
that
education
is
always
beset
with
the
danger
of
interfering
with
ancestral
and
congenital
tendencies
its
prime
object
ought
to
be
moralization
but
it
can
not
be
denied
that
in
conquering
ignorance
we
do
not
thereby
conquer
poverty
or
vice
after
the
free
schools
in
london
were
opened
there
was
an
increase
of
juvenile
offenders
new
kinds
of
crime
such
as
forgery
grand
larceny
intricate
swindling
schemes
were
doubled
while
sneak
thieves
drunkards
and
decreased
and
the
proportion
of
educated
criminals
was
greatly
augmented
to
collect
masses
of
children
and
ram
them
with
the
same
unassimilated
facts
is
not
education
in
this
sense
and
we
ought
to
confess
that
youthful
crime
is
an
expression
of
educational
failure
illiterate
criminals
are
more
likely
to
be
detected
and
also
to
be
condemned
than
are
educated
criminals
every
anthropologist
knows
that
the
deepest
poverty
and
ignorance
among
primitive
people
are
in
nowise
incompatible
with
honesty
integrity
and
virtue
indeed
there
is
much
reason
to
suspect
that
the
extremes
of
wealth
and
poverty
are
more
productive
of
crime
than
ignorance
or
even
intemperance
educators
have
no
doubt
vastly
overestimated
the
moral
efficiency
of
the
three
r
and
forgotten
that
character
in
infancy
is
all
instinct
that
in
childhood
it
is
slowly
made
over
into
habits
while
at
adolescence
more
than
at
any
other
period
of
life
it
can
be
cultivated
through
ideals
the
dawn
of
puberty
although
perhaps
marked
by
a
certain
moral
hebetude
is
soon
followed
by
a
stormy
period
of
great
agitation
when
the
very
worst
and
best
impulses
in
the
human
soul
struggle
against
each
other
for
its
possession
and
when
there
is
peculiar
proneness
to
be
either
very
good
or
very
bad
as
the
agitation
slowly
subsides
it
is
found
that
there
has
been
a
renaissance
of
either
the
best
or
the
worst
elements
of
the
soul
if
not
indeed
of
both
although
pedagogues
make
vast
claims
for
the
moralizing
effect
of
schooling
i
can
not
find
a
single
criminologist
who
is
satisfied
with
the
modern
school
while
most
bring
the
severest
indictments
against
it
for
the
blind
and
ignorant
assumption
that
the
three
r
or
any
merely
intellectual
training
can
moralize
by
nature
children
are
more
or
less
morally
blind
and
statistics
show
that
between
thirteen
and
sixteen
incorrigibility
is
between
two
and
three
times
as
great
as
at
any
other
age
it
is
almost
impossible
for
adults
to
realize
the
irresponsibility
and
even
moral
neurasthenia
incidental
to
this
stage
of
development
if
we
reflect
what
a
girl
would
do
if
dressed
like
a
boy
and
leading
his
life
and
exposed
to
the
same
moral
contagion
or
what
a
boy
would
do
if
corseted
and
compelled
to
live
like
a
girl
perhaps
we
can
realize
that
whatever
rôle
heredity
plays
the
youth
who
go
wrong
are
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
victims
of
circumstances
or
of
immaturity
and
deserving
of
both
pity
and
hope
it
was
this
sentiment
that
impelled
zarnadelli
to
reconstruct
the
criminal
law
of
italy
in
this
respect
and
it
was
this
sympathy
that
made
rollet
a
advocate
pleading
each
morning
for
the
twenty
or
thirty
boys
and
eight
or
ten
girls
arrested
every
day
in
paris
those
smitten
with
the
institution
craze
or
with
any
extreme
correctionalist
views
will
never
solve
the
problem
of
criminal
youths
first
of
all
they
must
be
carefully
and
objectively
studied
lived
with
and
understood
as
in
this
country
gulick
johnson
forbush
and
yoder
are
doing
in
different
ways
but
each
with
success
criminaloid
youth
is
more
sharply
individualized
than
the
common
good
child
who
is
less
differentiated
virtue
is
more
uniform
and
monotonous
than
sin
there
is
one
right
but
there
are
many
wrong
ways
hence
they
need
to
be
individually
studied
by
every
paidological
method
physical
and
psychic
keepers
attendants
and
even
sponsors
who
have
to
do
with
these
children
should
be
educators
with
souls
full
of
fatherhood
and
motherhood
and
they
should
understand
that
the
darkest
criminal
propensities
are
frequently
offset
by
the
very
best
qualities
that
juvenile
murderers
are
often
very
to
parents
sisters
children
or
pets
they
should
understand
that
in
the
criminal
constitution
there
are
precisely
the
same
ingredients
although
perhaps
differently
compounded
accentuated
mutually
controlled
by
the
environment
as
in
themselves
so
that
to
know
all
would
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
be
to
pardon
all
that
the
home
sentiments
need
emphasis
that
a
little
less
stress
of
misery
to
overcome
the
effects
of
economic
malaise
and
above
all
a
friend
mentor
adviser
are
needed
i
incline
to
think
that
many
children
would
be
better
and
not
worse
for
reading
provided
it
can
be
done
in
tender
years
stories
like
those
of
captain
kidd
jack
sheppard
dick
turpin
and
other
gory
tales
and
perhaps
later
tales
like
eugene
aram
and
the
ophidian
medicated
novel
elsie
venner
on
the
principle
of
the
aristotelian
catharsis
to
arouse
betimes
the
higher
faculties
which
develop
later
and
whose
function
it
is
to
deplete
the
bad
centers
and
suppress
or
inhibit
their
activity
again
i
believe
that
judicious
and
incisive
scolding
is
a
moral
tonic
which
is
often
greatly
needed
and
if
rightly
administered
would
be
extremely
effective
because
it
shows
the
instinctive
reaction
of
the
sane
conscience
against
evil
deeds
and
tendencies
special
pedagogic
attention
should
be
given
to
the
sentiment
of
justice
which
is
almost
the
beginning
of
personal
morals
in
boys
and
plays
should
be
chosen
and
encouraged
that
hold
the
beam
even
regardless
of
personal
wish
and
interest
further
yet
benevolence
and
its
underlying
impulse
to
do
more
than
justice
to
our
associates
to
do
good
in
the
world
to
give
pleasure
to
those
about
and
not
pain
can
be
directly
cultivated
presents
a
far
harder
problem
as
we
have
seen
it
is
no
pedagogical
triumph
to
clip
the
wings
of
fancy
but
effort
should
be
directed
almost
solely
against
the
cowardly
lies
which
cover
evil
and
the
heroism
of
telling
the
truth
and
taking
the
consequences
is
another
of
the
elements
of
the
moral
sense
so
complex
so
late
in
development
and
so
often
permanently
crippled
the
money
sense
by
all
the
many
means
now
used
for
its
development
in
school
is
the
surest
safeguard
against
the
most
common
juvenile
crime
of
theft
and
much
can
be
taught
by
precept
example
and
moral
regimen
of
the
sacredness
of
property
rights
the
regularity
of
school
work
and
its
industry
is
a
valuable
moralizing
agent
but
entirely
inadequate
and
insufficient
by
itself
educators
must
face
the
fact
that
the
ultimate
verdict
concerning
the
utility
of
the
school
will
be
determined
as
talleck
well
says
by
its
moral
efficiency
in
saving
children
from
personal
vice
and
crime
wherever
any
source
of
pollution
of
school
communities
occurs
it
must
be
at
once
and
effectively
detected
and
some
artificial
elements
must
be
introduced
into
the
environment
in
other
words
there
must
be
a
system
of
moral
orthopedics
garofalo
new
term
and
principle
of
temibility
is
perhaps
of
great
service
he
would
thus
designate
the
quantum
of
evil
feared
that
is
sufficient
to
restrain
criminal
impulsion
we
can
not
measure
guilt
or
culpability
which
may
be
of
all
degrees
from
nothing
to
infinity
perhaps
but
we
can
to
some
extent
scale
the
effectiveness
of
restraint
if
criminal
impulse
is
not
absolutely
irresistible
pain
then
must
be
so
organised
as
to
follow
and
measure
the
offense
by
as
nearly
a
natural
method
as
possible
while
on
the
other
hand
the
rewards
for
good
conduct
must
also
be
more
or
less
accentuated
thus
the
problem
of
criminology
for
youth
can
not
be
based
on
the
principles
now
recognised
for
adults
they
can
not
be
protective
of
society
only
but
must
have
marked
reformatory
elements
solitude
which
tends
to
make
weak
agitated
and
fearful
at
this
very
gregarious
age
should
be
enforced
with
very
great
discretion
there
must
be
no
personal
and
unmotivated
clemency
or
pardon
in
such
scheme
for
according
to
the
old
saw
mercy
but
murders
pardoning
those
who
kill
nor
on
the
other
hand
should
there
be
the
excessive
disregard
of
personal
adjustments
and
the
uniformitarian
who
perhaps
celebrated
his
highest
triumph
in
the
old
sentence
kill
all
offenders
and
suspects
for
god
will
know
his
own
should
have
no
part
nor
lot
here
the
philosopher
hartmann
has
a
suggestive
article
advocating
that
penal
colonies
made
up
of
transported
criminals
should
be
experimented
upon
by
statesmen
in
order
to
put
various
theories
of
to
a
practical
test
however
this
may
be
the
penologist
of
youth
must
face
some
such
problem
in
the
organization
of
the
house
of
detention
boys
club
farm
reformatory
etc
we
must
pass
beyond
the
clumsy
apparatus
of
a
term
or
the
devices
of
a
jury
clumsier
yet
for
this
purpose
we
must
admit
the
principle
of
regret
fear
penance
material
restoration
of
damage
and
understand
the
sense
in
which
for
both
society
and
for
the
individual
it
makes
no
practical
difference
whether
experts
think
there
is
some
taint
of
insanity
provided
only
that
irresponsibility
is
not
hopelessly
complete
in
few
aspects
of
this
theme
do
conceptions
of
and
practises
in
regard
to
adolescence
need
more
radical
reconstruction
a
mere
accident
of
circumstance
often
condemns
to
criminal
careers
youths
capable
of
the
highest
service
to
society
and
for
a
mere
brief
season
of
temperamental
outbreak
or
obstreperousness
exposes
them
to
all
the
infamy
to
which
ignorant
and
cruel
public
opinion
condemns
all
those
who
have
once
been
detected
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
invisible
and
arbitrary
line
of
rectitude
the
heart
of
criminal
psychology
is
here
and
not
only
that
but
i
would
conclude
with
a
most
earnest
personal
protest
against
the
current
methods
of
teaching
and
studying
ethics
in
our
academic
institutions
as
a
speculative
historical
and
abstract
thing
here
in
the
concrete
and
saliently
objective
facts
of
crime
it
should
have
its
beginning
and
have
more
blood
and
body
in
it
by
getting
again
close
to
the
hot
battle
line
between
vice
and
virtue
and
then
only
when
balanced
and
sanified
by
a
rich
ballast
of
facts
can
it
with
advantage
slowly
work
its
way
over
to
the
larger
and
higher
philosophy
of
conduct
which
when
developed
from
this
basis
will
be
a
radically
different
thing
from
the
shadowy
phantom
schematic
speculations
of
many
contemporary
moralists
taught
in
our
schools
and
colleges

and
scores
of
others
the
knightly
ideals
and
those
of
secular
life
generally
during
the
middle
ages
and
later
were
in
striking
contrast
to
the
ascetic
ideals
of
the
early
christian
church
in
some
respects
they
were
like
those
of
the
greeks
honor
was
the
leading
ideal
and
muscular
development
and
that
of
the
body
were
held
in
high
respect
so
that
the
spirit
of
the
age
fostered
conceptions
not
unlike
those
of
the
japanese
bushido
where
elements
of
christianity
were
combined
with
this
we
have
the
spirit
of
the
pure
chivalry
of
king
arthur
and
the
knights
of
the
round
table
which
affords
perhaps
the
very
best
ideals
for
youth
to
be
found
in
history
as
we
shall
see
more
fully
later
in
a
very
interesting
paper
entitled
shakespeare
and
adolescence
libby
very
roughly
reckons
interesting
adolescents
among
the
comedies
among
the
tragedies
and
nineteen
among
the
histories
he
selects
thirty
characters
who
either
on
account
of
direct
references
to
their
age
or
because
of
their
or
because
they
show
the
emotional
and
intellectual
plasticity
of
youth
may
be
regarded
as
typical
adolescents
his
list
is
as
follows
romeo
juliet
hamlet
ophelia
imogen
perdita
arviragus
guiderius
palamon
arcite
emilia
ferdinand
miranda
isabella
mariana
orlando
rosalind
biron
portia
jessica
phebe
katharine
helena
viola
troilus
cressida
cassio
marina
prince
hal
and
richard
of
gloucester
the
proof
of
the
youth
of
these
characters
as
set
forth
is
of
various
kinds
and
libby
holds
that
besides
these
the
sonnets
and
poems
perhaps
show
a
yet
greater
more
profound
and
concentrated
knowledge
of
adolescence
he
thinks
venus
and
adonis
a
successful
attempt
to
treat
sex
in
a
candid
naive
way
if
it
be
read
as
it
was
meant
as
a
catharsis
of
passion
in
which
is
latent
a
whole
philosophy
of
art
to
some
extent
he
also
finds
the
story
of
the
passionate
pilgrim
replete
with
the
deepest
knowledge
of
the
passions
of
early
adolescence
the
series
culminates
in
sonnet
which
makes
love
the
sole
beacon
of
humanity
it
might
be
said
that
it
is
connected
by
a
straight
line
with
the
best
teachings
of
plato
and
that
here
humanity
picked
up
the
clue
lost
save
with
some
italian
poets
in
the
great
interval
in
looking
over
current
autobiographies
of
modern
men
who
deal
with
their
boyhood
one
finds
curious
extremes
on
the
one
hand
are
those
of
which
doctor
is
a
type
where
details
are
dwelt
upon
at
great
length
with
careful
and
suggestive
philosophic
reflections
the
development
of
his
own
tastes
capacities
and
his
entire
adult
consciousness
was
assumed
to
be
due
to
the
incidents
of
childhood
and
youth
and
especially
the
latter
stage
was
to
him
full
of
the
most
serious
problems
essential
to
his
and
in
the
story
of
his
life
he
has
exploited
all
available
resources
of
this
genetic
period
of
storm
and
stress
more
fully
perhaps
than
any
other
writer
at
the
other
extreme
we
have
writers
like
charles
dudley
warner
a
man
whose
early
life
was
passed
on
the
farm
and
who
holds
his
own
boyhood
there
in
greater
contempt
than
perhaps
any
other
reputable
writer
of
such
reminiscences
all
the
incidents
are
treated
not
only
with
seriousness
but
with
a
forced
drollery
and
catchy
superficiality
which
reflect
unfavorably
at
almost
every
point
upon
the
members
of
his
household
who
are
caricatured
all
the
precious
associations
of
early
life
on
a
new
england
farm
are
not
only
made
absurd
but
from
beginning
to
end
his
book
has
not
a
scintilla
of
instruction
or
suggestion
for
those
that
are
interested
in
child
life
aldrich
is
better
and
we
have
interesting
glimpses
of
the
pet
horse
and
monkeys
of
his
fighting
the
boy
bully
running
way
and
falling
in
love
with
an
older
girl
whose
engagement
later
blighted
his
life
howells
white
mitter
grahame
heidi
and
barnett
might
perhaps
represent
increasing
grades
of
merit
in
this
field
in
this
respect
yoder
in
his
interesting
study
of
the
boyhood
of
great
men
has
called
attention
to
the
deplorable
carelessness
of
their
biographers
concerning
the
facts
and
influences
of
their
youth
he
advocates
the
great
pedagogic
influence
of
biography
and
would
restore
the
high
appreciation
of
it
felt
by
the
bolandists
which
comte
positivist
calendar
that
renamed
all
the
days
of
the
year
from
three
hundred
and
such
accounts
in
also
sought
to
revive
yoder
selected
fifty
great
modern
biographies
autobiographies
preferred
for
his
study
he
found
a
number
of
lives
whose
equipment
and
momentum
have
been
strikingly
due
to
some
devoted
aunt
and
that
give
many
glimpses
of
the
first
polarization
of
genius
in
the
direction
in
which
fame
is
later
achieved
he
holds
that
while
the
great
men
excelled
in
memory
imagination
is
perhaps
still
more
a
youthful
condition
of
eminence
magnifies
the
stimulus
of
poverty
the
fact
that
elder
sons
become
prominent
nearly
twice
as
often
as
younger
ones
and
raises
the
question
whether
too
exuberant
physical
development
does
not
dull
genius
and
talent
one
striking
and
cardinal
fact
never
to
be
forgotten
considering
its
each
and
every
phenomenon
and
stage
is
that
the
experiences
of
adolescence
are
extremely
transitory
and
very
easily
forgotten
so
that
they
are
often
totally
lost
to
the
adult
consciousness
lancaster
observes
that
we
are
constantly
told
by
adults
past
thirty
that
they
never
had
this
and
that
experience
and
that
those
who
have
had
them
are
abnormal
that
they
are
far
more
rare
than
students
of
childhood
assert
etc
he
says
not
a
single
young
person
with
whom
i
have
had
free
and
open
conversation
has
been
free
from
serious
thoughts
of
suicide
but
these
are
forgotten
later
a
typical
case
of
many
i
could
gather
is
that
of
a
lady
not
yet
in
middle
life
precise
and
carefully
trained
who
on
hearing
a
lecture
on
the
typical
phases
of
adolescence
declared
that
she
must
have
been
abnormal
for
she
knew
nothing
of
any
of
these
experiences
her
mother
however
produced
her
diary
and
there
she
read
for
the
first
time
since
it
was
written
beginning
in
the
january
of
her
thirteenth
year
a
long
series
of
resolutions
which
revealed
a
course
of
conduct
that
brought
the
color
to
her
face
that
she
should
have
found
it
necessary
to
pledge
not
to
swear
lie
and
which
showed
conclusively
that
she
had
passed
through
about
all
the
phases
described
these
phenomena
are
sometimes
very
intense
and
may
come
late
in
life
but
it
is
impossible
to
remember
feelings
and
emotions
with
definiteness
and
these
now
make
up
a
large
part
of
life
hence
we
are
prone
to
look
with
some
incredulity
upon
the
immediate
records
of
the
tragic
emotions
and
experiences
typical
and
normal
at
this
time
because
development
has
scored
away
their
traces
from
the
conscious
soul
there
is
a
wall
around
the
town
of
boyville
says
white
in
substance
which
is
impenetrable
when
its
gates
have
once
shut
upon
youth
an
adult
may
peer
over
the
wall
and
try
to
ape
the
games
inside
but
finds
it
all
a
mockery
and
himself
banished
among
the
purblind
the
town
of
boyville
was
old
when
nineveh
was
a
hamlet
it
is
ruled
by
ancient
laws
has
its
own
rulers
and
idols
and
only
the
dim
unreal
noises
of
the
adult
world
about
it
have
changed
in
exploring
such
sources
we
soon
see
how
few
writers
have
given
true
pictures
of
the
chief
traits
of
this
developmental
period
which
can
rarely
be
ascertained
with
accuracy
the
adult
finds
it
hard
to
recall
the
emotional
and
instinctive
life
of
the
teens
which
is
banished
without
a
trace
save
as
scattered
hints
may
be
gathered
from
diaries
chance
experiences
or
the
recollections
of
others
but
the
best
observers
see
but
very
little
of
what
goes
on
in
the
youthful
soul
the
development
of
which
is
very
largely
subterranean
only
when
the
feelings
erupt
in
some
surprising
way
is
the
process
manifest
the
best
of
these
sources
are
autobiographies
and
of
these
only
few
are
full
of
the
details
of
this
stage
just
as
in
the
mythic
prehistoric
stage
of
many
nations
there
is
a
body
of
legendary
matter
which
often
reappears
in
somewhat
different
form
so
there
is
a
floating
mass
of
tradition
and
storiology
that
seems
to
attach
to
eminence
wherever
it
emerges
and
is
repeated
over
and
over
again
concerning
the
youth
of
men
who
later
achieve
distinction
which
biographers
often
incorporate
and
attach
to
the
time
place
and
person
of
their
heroes
as
burnham
well
intimates
many
of
the
literary
characterizations
of
adolescence
are
so
marked
by
extravagance
and
sometimes
even
by
the
struggle
for
literary
effects
that
they
are
not
always
the
best
documents
although
often
based
on
personal
experience
confessionalism
is
generally
overdrawn
distorted
and
especially
the
pains
of
this
age
are
represented
as
too
keen
of
george
eliot
types
of
adolescent
character
this
may
best
be
seen
in
maggie
tulliver
with
her
enthusiastic
with
her
volcanic
upheavings
of
imprisoned
passions
with
her
wide
hopeless
yearning
for
that
something
whatever
it
was
that
was
greatest
and
best
on
this
earth
and
in
gwendolen
who
from
the
moment
she
caught
deronda
eye
was
totally
swayed
in
feeling
and
action
by
the
presence
of
a
person
of
the
other
sex
whom
she
had
never
seen
before
there
was
the
resolute
action
from
instinct
and
the
setting
at
defiance
of
calculation
and
reason
the
want
of
any
definite
desire
to
marry
while
all
her
conduct
tended
to
promote
proposals
exaggeration
although
not
the
perversions
of
this
age
often
found
in
adult
characterizations
is
marked
trait
of
the
writings
of
adolescents
whose
conduct
meanwhile
may
appear
rational
so
that
this
suggests
that
consciousness
may
at
this
stage
serve
as
a
harmless
vent
for
tendencies
that
would
otherwise
cause
great
trouble
if
turned
to
practical
affairs
if
harmodius
and
aristogeiton
the
adolescent
tyrant
slayers
of
greece
had
been
theorists
they
might
have
been
harmless
on
the
principle
that
its
analysis
tends
to
dissipate
emotion

interesting

adopted
by
an
uncle
and
entered
the
university
of
copenhagen
at
thirteen
where
multiplication
division
philosophy
and
metaphysics
were
taught
when
he
was
fourteen
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
occurred
which
aroused
so
much
interest
that
he
decided
to
devote
himself
to
the
study
of
the
heavenly
bodies
he
was
able
to
construct
a
series
of
interesting
instruments
on
a
progressive
scale
of
size
and
finally
to
erect
the
great
observatory
of
uraniberg
on
the
island
of

strange
to
say
his
scientific
conclusions
had
for
him
profound
astrological
significance
an
important
new
star
he
declared
was
at
first
like
venus
and
jupiter
and
its
effects
will
therefore
first
be
pleasant
but
as
it
then
became
like
mars
there
will
next
come
a
period
of
wars
seditions
captivity
and
death
of
princes
and
destruction
of
cities
together
with
dryness
and
fiery
meteors
in
the
air
pestilence
and
venomous
snakes
lastly
the
star
became
like
saturn
and
thus
will
finally
come
a
time
of
want
death
imprisonment
and
all
kinds
of
sad
things

says
that
a
special
use
of

is
that
it

twenty
years

inscribed

poorly

his

incentive

came
from

taught
himself

made

with

speculated
about
the
basis
of

on

and
reproached
himself
that

did
not

get
on
enough
at
seventeen
he
attempted
a
comprehensive
classification

women
with

gifts
perhaps
surpass
men
in
their
power
to
reproduce
and
describe
the
great
but
so
often
evanescent
ebullitions
of
this
age
perhaps
because
their
later
lives
on
account
of
their
more
generic
nature
depart
less
from
this
totalizing
period
or
because
although
it
is
psychologically
shorter
than
in
men
the
necessities
of
earning
a
livelihood
less
frequently
arrest
its
full
development
and
again
because
they
are
more
emotional
and
feeling
constitutes
the
chief
psychic
ingredient
of
this
stage
of
life

more
on

madame
roland
was
born
in
her
father
was
an
engraver
in
comfortable
circumstances
her
earliest
enthusiasm
was
for
the
bible
and
lives
of
the
saints
and
she
had
almost
a
mania
for
reading
books
of
any
kind
in
the
corner
of
her
father
workshop
she
would
read
plutarch
for
hours
dream
of
the
past
glories
of
antiquity
and
exclaim
weeping
why
was
i
not
born
a
greek
she
desired
to
emulate
the
brave
men
of
old
books
and
flowers
aroused
her
to
dreams
of
enthusiasm
romantic
sentiment
and
lofty
aspiration
finding
that
the
french
society
afforded
no
opportunity
for
heroic
living
in
her
visionary
fervor
she
fell
back
upon
a
life
of
religious
mysticism
and
xavier
loyola
elizabeth
and
theresa
became
her
new
idols
she
longed
to
follow
even
to
the
stake
those
devout
men
and
women
who
had
borne
obloquy
poverty
hunger
thirst
wretchedness
and
the
agony
of
a
death
for
the
sake
of
jesus
her
capacities
for
became
perhaps
her
leading
trait
always
longing
after
a
grand
life
like
george
eliot
dorothea
brooke
she
was
allowed
at
the
age
of
eleven
to
enter
a
convent
where
shunning
her
companions
she
courted
solitude
apart
under
the
trees
reading
and
thinking
artificial
as
the
atmosphere
was
here
it
no
doubt
inspired
her
life
with
permanent
tenderness
of
feeling
and
loftiness
of
purpose
and
gave
a
mystic
quality
to
her
imagination
later
she
experienced
to
the
full
revulsion
of
thought
and
experience
which
comes
when
doubt
reacts
upon
youthful
credulity
it
was
the
age
of
the
encyclopedia
and
now
she
came
to
doubt
her
creed
and
even
god
and
the
soul
but
clung
to
the
gospels
as
the
best
possible
code
of
morals
and
later
realized
that
while
her
intellect
had
wandered
her
heart
had
remained
constant
at
seventeen
she
was
if
not
the
moat
beautiful
perhaps
the
noblest
woman
in
all
france
and
here
the
curtain
moat
drop
upon
her
girlhood
all
her
traits
were
of
course
set
off
by
the
great
life
she
lived
and
the
yet
greater
death
she
died
gifted
people
seem
to
conserve
their
youth
and
to
be
all
the
more
children
and
perhaps
especially
all
the
more
intensely
adolescents
because
of
their
gifts
and
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
marks
of
genius
that
the
plasticity
and
spontaneity
of
adolescence
persists
into
maturity
sometimes
even
its
passions
reveries
and
hoydenish
freaks
continue
in
her
histoire
de
ma
vie
it
is
plain
that
george
sand
inherited
at
this
age
an
unusual
dower
of
gifts
she
composed
many
and
interminable
stories
carried
on
day
after
day
so
that
her
confidants
tried
to
tease
her
by
asking
if
the
prince
had
got
out
of
the
forest
yet
etc
she
personated
an
echo
and
conversed
with
it
her
and
plays
were
so
intense
that
she
often
came
back
from
the
world
of
imagination
to
reality
with
a
shock
she
spun
a
weird
zoological
romance
out
of
a
rustic
legend
of
grande
when
her
aunt
sent
her
to
a
convent
she
passed
a
year
of
rebellion
and
revolt
and
was
the
leader
of
or
those
who
refused
to
be
devout
and
engaged
in
all
wild
pranks
at
fifteen
she
became
profoundly
interested
in
the
lives
of
the
saints
although
ridiculing
miracles
she
entered
one
evening
the
convent
church
for
service
without
permission
which
was
an
act
of
disobedience
the
mystery
and
holy
charm
of
it
penetrated
her
she
forgot
everything
outward
and
was
left
alone
and
some
mysterious
change
stole
over
her
she
breathed
an
atmosphere
of
ineffable
sweetness
more
with
the
mind
than
the
senses
had
a
sudden
indescribable
perturbation
her
eyes
swam
she
was
enveloped
in
a
white
glimmer
and
heard
a
voice
murmur
the
words
written
under
a
convent
picture
of
augustine
lege
and
turned
around
thinking
mother
alicia
spoke
but
she
was
alone
she
knew
it
was
an
hallucination
but
saw
that
faith
had
laid
hold
of
her
as
she
wished
by
the
heart
and
she
sobbed
and
prayed
to
the
unknown
god
till
a
nun
heard
her
groaning
at
first
her
ardor
impelled
her
not
only
to
brave
the
jeers
of
her
madcap
club
of
and
tomboys
but
she
planned
to
become
a
nun
until
this
feverish
longing
for
a
recluse
life
passed
but
left
her
changed
when
she
passed
from
the
simple
and
catholic
faith
of
her
grisette
mother
to
the
atmosphere
of
her
cynical
grandmother
at
nohant
who
was
a
disciple
of
voltaire
she
found
herself
in
great
straits
between
the
profound
sentiments
inspired
by
the
first
communion
and
the
concurrent
contempt
for
this
faith
instilled
by
her
grandmother
for
all
those
mummeries
through
which
however
for
conventional
reasons
she
was
obliged
to
pass
her
heart
was
deeply
stirred
and
yet
her
head
holding
all
religion
to
be
fiction
or
metaphor
it
occurred
to
her
to
invent
a
story
which
might
be
a
religion
or
a
religion
which
might
be
a
story
into
any
degree
of
belief
in
which
she
could
lapse
at
will
the
name
and
the
form
of
her
new
deity
was
revealed
to
her
in
a
dream
he
was
corambé
pure
as
jesus
beautiful
as
gabriel
as
graceful
as
the
nymphs
and
orpheus
less
austere
than
the
christian
god
and
as
much
woman
as
man
because
she
could
best
understand
this
sex
from
her
love
for
her
mother
he
appeared
in
many
aspects
of
physical
and
moral
beauty
was
eloquent
master
of
all
arts
and
above
all
of
the
magic
of
musical
improvisation
loved
as
a
friend
and
sister
and
at
the
same
time
revered
as
a
god
not
awful
and
remote
from
impeccability
but
with
the
fault
of
excess
of
indulgence
she
estimated
that
she
composed
about
a
thousand
sacred
books
or
songs
developing
phases
of
his
mundane
existence
in
each
of
these
he
became
incarnate
man
on
touching
the
earth
always
in
a
new
group
of
people
who
were
good
yet
suffering
martyrdoms
from
the
wicked
known
only
by
the
effects
of
their
malice
in
this
gentle
hallucination
she
could
lose
herself
in
the
midst
of
friends
and
turn
to
her
hero
deity
for
comfort
there
must
be
not
only
sacred
books
but
a
temple
and
ritual
and
in
a
garden
thicket
which
no
eye
could
penetrate
in
a
chamber
she
built
an
altar
against
a
ornamented
with
a
wreath
hung
over
it
instead
of
sacrificing
which
seemed
barbaric
she
proceeded
to
restore
life
and
liberty
to
butterflies
lizards
green
frogs
and
birds
which
she
put
in
a
box
laid
on
the
altar
and
after
having
invoked
the
good
genius
of
liberty
and
protection
opened
it
in
these
mimic
rites
and
delicious
reveries
she
found
the
germs
of
a
religion
that
fitted
her
heart
from
the
instant
however
that
a
boy
playmate
discovered
and
entered
this
sanctuary
corambé
ceased
to
dwell
in
it
the
dryads
and
the
cherubim
deserted
it
and
it
seemed
unreal
the
temple
was
destroyed
with
great
care
and
the
garlands
and
shells
were
buried

it
was
hard

she
was
smitten
with
a
mania
for
the

spent

of

taught
wrote
for
the
papers
did
housework
for
pay
as
a
servant
and
found
sewing
a
pleasant
resource
because
it
was
tranquillizing
left
her
free
and
set
her
thoughts
going
burnett
like
most
women
who
record
their
childhood
and
adolescent
memories
is
far
more
subjective
and
interesting
than
most
men
in
early
adolescence
she
was
never
alone
when
with
flowers
but
loved
to
speak
to
them
to
bend
down
and
say
caressing
things
to
stoop
and
kiss
them
to
praise
them
for
their
pretty
ways
of
looking
up
at
her
as
into
the
eyes
of
a
friend
and
beloved
there
were
certain
little
blue
violets
which
always
seemed
to
lift
their
small
faces
childishly
as
if
they
were
saying
me
do
go
by
like
that
she
would
sit
on
the
porch
elbows
on
knees
and
chin
on
hands
staring
upward
sometimes
lying
on
the
grass
heaven
was
so
high
and
yet
she
was
a
part
of
it
and
was
something
even
among
the
stars
it
was
a
weird
updrawn
overwhelming
feeling
as
she
stared
so
fixedly
and
intently
that
the
earth
seemed
gone
left
far
behind
every
hour
and
moment
was
a
wonderful
and
beautiful
thing
she
felt
on
speaking
terms
with
the
rabbits
something
was
happening
in
the
leaves
which
waved
and
rustled
as
she
passed
just
to
walk
sit
lie
around
out
of
doors
to
loiter
gaze
watch
with
a
heart
fresh
as
a
young
dryad
following
birds
playing
with
the
were
her
halcyon
hours
with
the
instability
of
genius
beth
did
everything
suddenly
when
twelve
or
thirteen
she
had
grown
too
big
to
be
carried
pulled
or
pushed
she
suddenly
stood
still
one
day
when
her
mother
commanded
her
to
dress
she
had
been
ruled
before
by
physical
force
but
her
will
and
that
of
her
mother
were
now
in
collision
and
the
latter
realised
she
could
make
her
do
nothing
unless
by
persuasion
or
moral
influence
being
constantly
reproved
scolded
and
even
beaten
by
her
mother
beth
one
day
impulsively
jumped
into
the
sea
and
was
rescued
with
difficulty
she
had
spells
of
being
miserable
with
no
cause
she
was
well
and
happy
but
would
burst
into
tears
suddenly
which
seemed
often
to
surprise
her
being
very
sensitive
herself
she
was
morbidly
careful
of
the
feelings
of
others
and
incessantly
committed
grave
sins
of
insincerity
without
compunction
in
her
effort
to
spare
them
to
those
who
confided
in
her
abilities
praised
her
and
thought
she
could
do
things
her
nature
expanded
but
her
mother
checked
her
mental
growth
over
and
over
instead
of
helping
her
by
saying
try
you
ca
do
it
etc
just
before
the
dawn
of
adolescence
she
had
passed
through
a
long
period
of
abject
superstition
largely
through
the
influence
of
a
servant
all
the
old
woman
signs
were
very
dominant
in
her
life
she
even
invented
methods
of
divination
as
if
the
boards
do
not
creak
when
i
walk
across
the
room
i
shall
get
through
my
lessons
without
trouble
she
always
preferred
to
see
two
rooks
together
to
one
and
became
expert
in
the
black
arts
she
used
to
hear
strange
noises
at
night
for
a
time
which
seemed
signs
and
portents
of
disaster
at
sea
fell
into
the
ways
of
her
neighbors
and
had
more
faith
in
incantations
than
in
doctors
doses
she
not
only
heard
voices
and
very
ingeniously
described
them
but
claimed
to
know
what
was
going
to
happen
and
compared
her
forebodings
with
the
maid
she
got
religion
very
intensely
under
the
influence
of
her
aunt
grew
thin
lost
her
appetite
and
sleep
had
heartache
to
think
of
her
friends
burning
in
hell
and
tried
to
save
them
beth
never
thought
at
all
of
her
personal
appearance
until
she
overheard
a
gentleman
call
her
rather
when
her
face
flushed
and
she
had
a
new
feeling
of
surprise
and
pleasure
and
took
very
clever
ways
of
her
friends
to
find
if
she
was
handsome
all
of
a
sudden
the
care
of
her
person
became
of
great
importance
and
every
hint
she
had
heard
of
was
acted
on
she
aired
her
bed
brushed
her
hair
glossy
pinched
her
waist
and
feet
washed
in
buttermilk
used
a
parasol
tortured
her
natural
appetite
in
every
way
put
on
gloves
to
do
dirty
work
etc
the
house
always
irked
her
once
stealing
out
of
the
school
by
night
she
was
free
stretched
herself
drew
a
long
breath
bounded
and
waved
her
arms
in
an
ecstasy
of
liberty
danced
around
the
magnolia
buried
her
face
in
the
big
flowers
one
after
another
and
bathed
it
in
the
dew
of
the
petals
visited
every
forbidden
place
was
particularly
attracted
to
the
water
enjoyed
scratching
and
making
her
feet
bleed
and
eating
a
lot
of
green
fruit
this
liberty
was
most
precious
and
all
through
a
hot
summer
she
kept
herself
healthy
by
exercise
in
the
moonlight
this
revived
her
appetite
and
she
ended
these
night
excursions
by
a
forage
in
the
kitchen
beth
had
times
when
she
hungered
for
solitude
and
for
nature
sometimes
she
would
shut
herself
in
her
room
but
more
often
would
rove
the
fields
and
woods
in
ecstasy
coming
home
from
school
where
she
had
long
been
she
had
to
greet
the
trees
and
fields
almost
before
she
did
her
parents
she
had
a
great
habit
of
stealing
out
often
by
the
most
dangerous
routes
over
roofs
at
night
in
the
moonlight
running
and
jumping
waving
her
arms
throwing
herself
on
the
ground
rolling
over
walling
on
turning
somersaults
hugging
trees
playing
with
the
shadow
now
playing
and
feeling
fear
and
running
away
she
invoked
trees
stars
etc
beth
first
love
affair
was
with
a
bright
boy
who
sat
near
her
pew
sundays
they
looked
at
each
other
once
during
service
and
she
felt
a
glad
glow
in
her
chest
spread
over
her
dwelt
on
his
image
smiled
and
even
the
next
day
felt
a
new
desire
to
please
she
watched
for
him
to
pass
from
school
when
he
appeared
had
a
most
delightful
thrill
shoot
through
her
the
first
impulse
to
fly
was
conquered
she
never
thought
a
boy
beautiful
before
they
often
met
after
dark
wrote
finally
she
grew
tired
of
him
because
she
could
not
make
him
feel
deeply
sent
him
off
called
him
an
idiot
and
then
soliloquized
on
the
most
dreadful
grief
of
her
life
the
latter
stages
of
their
acquaintance
she
occasionally
used
to
beat
him
but
his
attraction
steadily
waned
once
later
as
she
was
suffering
from
a
dull
irresolute
feeling
due
to
want
of
a
companion
and
an
object
she
met
a
boy
of
seventeen
whose
face
like
her
own
brightened
as
they
approached
it
was
the
first
appearance
of
nature
mandate
to
mate
this
friendly
glance
suffused
her
whole
being
with
the
glory
and
vision
of
love
religion
and
young
men
were
her
need
they
had
stolen
interviews
by
night
and
many
an
innocent
embrace
and
kiss
and
almost
died
once
by
being
caught
they
planned
in
detail
what
they
would
do
after
they
were
married
but
all
was
taken
for
granted
without
formal
vows
only
when
criticized
did
they
ever
dream
of
caution
and
concealment
and
then
they
made
elaborate
parades
of
ignoring
each
other
in
public
and
fired
their
imaginations
with
thoughts
of
disguises
masks
etc
this
passion
was
nipped
in
the
bud
by
the
removal
from
his
school
in
preparing
for
her
first
communion
an
anonymous
writer
became
sober
and
studious
proposing
to
model
her
life
on
that
of
each
fresh
saint
and
to
spend
a
week
in
retreat
examining
her
conscience
with
vengeance
she
wanted
to
revive
the
custom
of
public
confession
and
wrote
letters
of
penitence
and
submission
which
she
tore
up
later
finding
her
mind
not
all
of
a
piece
she
lay
prostrate
on
her
weeping
from
ecstasy
lying
on
the
rim
of
heaven
held
by
angels
wanting
to
die
now
bathed
in
bliss
or
aching
intolerably
with
spiritual
joy
but
she
was
only
twelve
and
her
old
nature
often
reasserted
itself
religion
at
that
time
became
an
intense
emotion
nourished
on
incense
music
tapers
and
a
feeling
of
being
tangible
it
was
rapturous
and
sensuous
while
under
its
spell
she
seemed
to
float
and
touch
the
wings
of
angels
here
solemn
gregorian
chants
are
sung
so
that
when
one
comes
back
to
earth
there
is
a
sense
of
hunger
deception
and
now
she
came
to
understand
how
so
many
sentimental
and
virtuous
souls
sought
oblivion
in
the
narcotic
of
religious
excitement
here
at
the
age
of
twelve
youth
began
and
childhood
ended
with
her
book
pathetic
is
the
account
of
helen
keller
effort
to
understand
the
meaning
of
the
word
love
in
its
season
is
it
the
sweetness
of
flowers
she
asked
no
said
her
teacher
is
it
the
warm
sun
not
exactly
it
can
not
be
touched
you
feel
the
sweetness
that
it
pours
into
everything
without
love
you
would
not
be
happy
or
want
to
play
the
beautiful
truth
burst
upon
my
mind
i
felt
that
there
were
invisible
lines
stretched
between
my
spirit
and
the
spirit
of
others
this
period
seems
to
have
came
gradually
and
naturally
to
this
wonderful
child
whose
life
has
been
perhaps
the
purest
ever
lived
and
one
of
the
sweetest
none
has
ever
loved
every
aspect
of
nature
accessible
to
her
more
passionately
or
felt
more
keenly
the
charm
of
nature
or
of
beautiful
sentiments
the
unhappy
frost
king
episode
has
been
almost
the
only
cloud
upon
her
life
which
unfortunately
came
at
about
the
dawn
of
this
period
that
is
perhaps
better
marked
by
the
great
expansion
of
mind
which
she
experienced
at
the
world
fair
in
chicago
in
when
she
was
thirteen
about
this
time
too
her
great
ambition
of
going
to
college
and
enjoying
all
the
advantages
that
other
girls
did
which
considering
her
handicap
was
one
of
the
greatest
human
resolutions
was
strengthened
and
deepened
the
fresh
spontaneous
and
exquisite
reactions
of
this
pellucid
mind
which
felt
that
each
individual
could
comprehend
all
the
experiences
and
emotions
of
the
race
and
that
chafed
at
every
pedagogical
and
technical
obstacle
between
her
soul
and
nature
and
the
great
monuments
of
literature
show
that
she
has
conserved
to
a
remarkable
degree
which
the
world
will
wish
may
be
permanent
the
best
impulses
of
this
golden
age
marie
bashkirtseff
who
may
be
taken
as
one
of
the
best
types
of
exaggerated
adolescent
confessionalists
was
rich
and
of
noble
birth
and
began
in
at
the
age
of
twelve
to
write
a
journal
that
should
be
absolutely
true
and
frank
with
no
pretense
affectation
or
concealment
the
journal
continues
until
her
death
october
at
the
age
of
it
may
be
described
as
in
some
sense
a
feminine
counterpart
of
rousseau
confessions
but
is
in
some
respects
a
more
precious
psychological
document
than
any
other
for
the
elucidation
of
the
adolescent
ferment
in
an
unusually
vigorous
and
gifted
soul
twice
i
have
read
it
from
cover
to
cover
and
with
growing
interest
at
twelve
she
is
passionately
in
love
with
a
duke
whom
she
sometimes
saw
pass
but
who
had
no
knowledge
of
her
existence
and
builds
many
air
castles
about
his
throwing
himself
at
her
feet
and
of
their
life
together
she
prays
passionately
to
see
him
again
would
dazzle
him
on
the
stage
would
lead
a
perfect
life
develop
her
voice
and
would
be
an
ideal
wife
she
agonizes
before
the
glass
on
whether
or
not
she
is
pretty
and
resolves
to
ask
some
young
man
but
prefers
to
think
well
of
herself
even
if
it
is
an
illusion
constantly
modulates
over
into
passionate
prayer
to
god
to
grant
all
her
wishes
is
oppressed
with
despair
gay
and
melancholy
by
turn
believes
in
god
because
she
prayed
him
for
a
set
of
croquet
and
to
help
her
to
learn
english
both
of
which
he
granted
at
church
some
prayers
and
services
seem
directly
aimed
at
her
paris
now
seems
a
frightful
desert
and
she
has
no
motive
to
avoid
carelessness
in
her
appearance
she
has
freaky
and
very
changeable
ideas
of
arranging
the
things
in
her
room
when
she
hears
of
the
duke
marriage
she
almost
throws
herself
over
a
bridge
prays
god
for
pardon
of
her
sins
and
thinks
all
is
ended
finds
it
horrible
to
dissemble
her
feelings
in
public
goes
through
the
torture
of
altering
her
prayer
about
the
duke
she
is
disgusted
with
common
people
harrowed
by
jealousy
envy
deceit
and
every
hideous
feeling
yet
feels
herself
frozen
in
the
depth
and
moving
only
on
the
surface
when
her
voice
improves
she
welcomes
it
with
tears
and
feels
an
queen
the
man
she
loves
should
never
speak
to
another
her
journal
she
resolves
to
make
the
most
instructive
book
that
ever
was
or
ever
will
be
written
she
esteems
herself
so
great
a
treasure
that
no
one
is
worthy
of
her
pities
those
who
think
they
can
please
her
thinks
herself
a
real
divinity
prays
to
the
moon
to
show
her
in
dreams
her
future
husband
and
quarrels
with
her
photographs
in
some
moods
she
feels
herself
beautiful
knows
she
shall
succeed
everything
smiles
upon
her
and
she
is
absolutely
happy
and
yet
in
the
next
paragraph
the
fever
of
life
at
high
pressure
palls
upon
her
and
things
seem
asleep
and
unreal
her
attempts
to
express
her
feelings
drive
her
to
desperation
because
words
are
inadequate
she
loves
to
weep
gives
up
to
despair
to
think
of
death
and
finds
everything
transcendently
exquisite
she
comes
to
despise
men
and
wonder
whether
the
good
are
always
stupid
and
the
intelligent
always
false
and
saturated
with
baseness
but
on
the
whole
believes
that
some
time
or
other
she
is
destined
to
meet
one
true
good
and
great
man
now
she
is
inflated
with
pride
of
her
ancestry
her
gifts
and
would
subordinate
everybody
and
everything
she
would
never
speak
a
commonplace
word
and
then
again
feels
that
her
life
has
been
a
failure
and
she
is
destined
to
be
always
waiting
she
falls
on
her
knees
sobbing
praying
to
god
with
outstretched
hands
as
if
he
were
in
her
room
almost
vows
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
jerusalem
of
the
way
on
foot
to
devote
her
money
to
good
works
lacks
the
pleasures
proper
to
her
age
wonders
if
she
can
ever
love
again
on
throwing
a
bouquet
from
a
window
into
a
crowd
in
the
corso
a
young
man
choked
so
beautifully
a
workman
who
caught
it
that
by
that
one
act
of
strangling
and
snatching
the
bouquet
she
fell
in
love
the
young
man
calls
and
they
see
each
other
often
now
she
is
clad
from
head
to
foot
in
an
armor
of
cold
politeness
now
vanity
and
now
passion
seem
uppermost
in
their
meetings
she
wonders
if
a
certain
amount
of
sin
like
air
is
necessary
to
a
man
to
sustain
life
finally
they
vow
mutual
love
and
pietro
leaves
and
she
begins
to
fear
that
she
has
cherished
illusions
or
been
insulted
is
torments
at
things
unsaid
or
of
her
spelling
in
french
she
coughs
and
for
three
days
has
a
new
idea
that
she
is
going
to
die
prays
and
prostrates
herself
sixty
times
one
for
each
bead
in
her
rosary
touching
the
floor
with
her
forehead
every
time
wonders
if
god
takes
intentions
into
account
resolves
to
read
the
new
testament
but
can
not
find
one
and
reads
dumas
instead
in
she
imagines
herself
the
heroine
of
every
scene
sees
her
lover
and
they
plan
their
mode
of
life
together
and
at
last
kiss
each
other
but
later
she
feels
humiliated
chilled
doubts
if
it
is
real
love
studies
the
color
of
her
lips
to
see
if
they
have
changed
fears
that
she
has
compromised
herself
has
eye
symptoms
that
make
her
fear
blindness
once
on
reading
the
testament
she
smiled
and
clasped
her
hands
gazed
upward
was
no
longer
herself
but
in
ecstasy
she
makes
many
programs
for
life
is
haunted
by
the
phrase
we
live
but
once
wants
to
live
a
dozen
lives
in
one
but
feels
that
she
does
not
live
of
a
life
has
several
spells
of
solitary
illumination
at
other
times
she
wishes
to
be
the
center
of
a
salon
and
imagines
herself
to
be
so
she
soars
on
poets
wings
but
often
has
hell
in
her
heart
slowly
love
is
vowed
henceforth
to
be
a
word
without
meaning
to
her
although
she
suffers
from
she
realizes
that
women
live
only
from
sixteen
to
forty
and
can
not
bear
the
thought
of
losing
a
moment
of
her
life
criticizes
her
mother
scorns
marriage
and
which
any
washerwoman
can
attain
but
pants
for
glory
now
hates
now
longs
to
see
new
faces
thinks
of
disguising
herself
as
a
poor
girl
and
going
out
to
seek
her
fortunes
thinks
her
mad
vanity
is
her
devil
that
her
ambitions
are
justified
by
no
results
hates
moderation
in
anything
would
have
intense
and
constant
excitement
or
absolute
repose
at
fifteen
abandons
her
idea
of
the
duke
but
wants
an
idol
and
finally
decides
to
live
for
fame
studies
her
shoulders
hips
bust
to
gauge
her
success
in
life
tries
hits
every
time
and
feels
it
to
be
fateful
at
times
despises
her
mother
because
she
is
so
easily
influenced
by
her
meets
another
man
whose
affection
for
her
she
thinks
might
be
as
reverent
as
religion
and
who
never
profaned
the
purity
of
his
life
by
a
thought
but
finally
drops
him
because
the
possible
disappointment
would
be
unbearable
finds
that
the
more
unhappy
any
one
is
for
love
of
us
the
happier
we
are
wonders
why
she
has
weeping
spells
wonders
what
love
that
people
talk
so
much
about
really
is
and
whether
she
is
ever
to
know
one
night
at
the
age
of
seventeen
she
has
a
fit
of
despair
which
vents
itself
in
moans
until
arising
she
seizes
the
clock
rushes
out
and
throws
it
into
the
sea
when
she
becomes
happy
poor
clock
at
another
time
she
fears
she
has
used
the
word
love
lightly
and
resolves
to
no
longer
invoke
god
help
yet
in
the
next
line
prays
him
to
let
her
die
as
everything
is
against
her
her
thoughts
are
incoherent
she
hates
herself
and
everything
is
contemptible
but
she
wishes
to
die
peacefully
while
some
one
is
singing
a
beautiful
air
of
verdi
again
she
thinks
of
shaving
her
head
to
save
the
trouble
of
arranging
her
hair
is
crazed
to
think
that
every
moment
brings
her
nearer
death
to
waste
a
moment
of
life
is
infamous
yet
she
can
trust
no
one
all
the
freshness
of
life
is
gone
few
things
affect
her
now
she
wonders
how
in
the
past
she
could
have
acted
so
foolishly
and
reasoned
so
wisely
is
proud
that
no
advice
in
the
world
could
ever
keep
her
from
doing
anything
she
wished
she
thinks
the
journal
of
her
former
years
exaggerated
and
resolves
to
be
moderate
wants
to
make
others
feel
as
she
feels
finds
that
the
only
cure
for
disenchantment
with
life
is
devotion
to
work
fears
her
face
is
wearing
an
anxious
look
instead
of
the
confident
expression
which
was
its
chief
charm
impossible
is
a
hideous
maddening
word
to
think
of
dying
like
a
dog
as
most
people
do
and
leaving
nothing
behind
is
a
granite
wall
against
which
she
every
instant
dashes
her
head
if
she
loved
a
man
every
expression
of
admiration
for
anything
or
anybody
else
in
her
presence
would
be
a
profanation
now
she
thinks
the
man
she
loves
must
never
know
what
it
is
to
be
in
want
of
money
and
must
purchase
everything
he
wishes
must
weep
to
see
a
woman
want
for
anything
and
find
the
door
of
no
palace
or
club
barred
to
him
art
becomes
a
great
shining
light
in
her
life
of
few
pleasures
and
many
griefs
yet
she
dares
hope
for
nothing
at
eighteen
all
her
caprices
are
exhausted
she
vows
and
prays
in
the
name
of
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
for
her
wishes
she
would
like
to
be
a
millionaire
get
back
her
voice
obtain
the
de
under
the
guise
of
a
man
and
marry
napoleon
iv
on
winning
a
medal
for
her
pictures
she
does
nothing
but
laugh
cry
and
dream
of
greatness
but
the
next
day
is
scolded
and
grows
discouraged
she
has
an
immense
sense
of
growth
and
transformation
so
that
not
a
trace
of
her
old
nature
remains
feels
that
she
has
far
too
much
of
some
things
and
far
too
little
of
others
in
her
nature
sees
defects
in
her
character
whose
pertinacity
is
like
a
disease
realizes
that
one
of
her
chief
passions
is
to
inspire
rather
than
to
feel
love
that
her
temper
is
profoundly
affected
by
her
dress
deplores
that
her
family
expect
her
to
achieve
greatness
rather
than
give
her
the
stimulus
of
expecting
nothing
declares
that
she
thanks
a
million
thoughts
for
every
word
that
she
writes
is
disgusted
with
and
sometimes
absolutely
hates
herself
at
one
time
she
coquets
with
kant
and
wonders
if
he
is
right
that
all
things
exist
only
in
the
imagination
has
a
passion
for
such
abracadabrante
follies
that
seem
so
learned
and
logical
but
is
grieved
to
feel
them
to
be
false
longs
to
penetrate
the
intellectual
world
to
see
learn
and
know
everything
admires
balzac
because
he
describes
so
frankly
all
that
he
has
felt
loves
fleury
who
has
shown
her
a
wider
horizon
still
has
spells
of
admiring
her
dazzling
complexion
and
deploring
that
she
can
not
go
out
alone
feels
that
she
is
losing
her
grip
on
art
and
also
on
god
who
no
longer
hears
her
prayers
and
resolves
to
kill
herself
if
she
is
not
famous
at
thirty
at
nineteen
and
even
before
she
has
spells
of
feeling
inefficient
cries
calls
on
god
feels
exhausted
is
almost
stunned
when
she
hears
that
the
young
french
prince
about
whom
she
has
spun
romances
was
killed
by
the
kaffirs
feels
herself
growing
serious
and
sensible
despises
death
realizes
that
god
is
not
what
she
thought
but
is
perhaps
nature
and
life
or
is
perhaps
chance
she
thinks
out
possible
pictures
she
might
paint
develops
a
platonic
friendship
for
her
professor
might
marry
an
old
man
with
millions
but
spurns
the
thought
finds
herself
growing
deaf
gradually
and
at
nineteen
finds
three
grey
hairs
has
awful
remorse
for
days
when
she
can
not
work
and
so
loses
herself
in
novels
and
cigarettes
makes
many
good
resolutions
and
then
commits
some
folly
as
if
in
a
dream
has
spells
of
reviewing
the
past
when
the
doctor
finds
a
serious
lung
trouble
and
commands
iodine
oil
hot
milk
and
flannel
she
at
first
scorns
death
and
refuses
all
and
is
delighted
at
the
terror
of
her
friends
but
gradually
does
all
that
is
necessary
feels
herself
too
precocious
and
doomed
deplores
especially
that
consumption
will
cost
her
her
good
looks
has
fits
of
intense
anger
alternating
with
tears
concludes
that
death
is
annihilation
realizes
the
horrible
thought
that
she
has
a
skeleton
within
her
that
some
time
or
other
will
come
out
reads
the
new
testament
again
and
returns
to
belief
in
miracle
and
prayer
to
jesus
and
the
virgin
distributes
one
thousand
francs
to
the
poor
records
the
dreamy
delusions
that
flow
through
her
brain
at
night
and
the
strange
sensations
by
day
her
eye
symptoms
cause
her
to
fear
blindness
again
she
grows
superstitious
believing
in
signs
and
is
strongly
impelled
to
embrace
and
make
up
with
her
mother
at
times
defies
god
and
death
sees
a
spanish
and
gets
from
it
a
general
impression
of
human
cowardice
but
has
a
strange
intoxication
with
blood
and
would
like
to
thrust
a
lance
into
the
neck
of
every
one
she
meets
coquets
a
great
deal
with
the
thought
of
marriage
takes
up
her
art
and
paints
a
few
very
successful
pictures
tries
to
grapple
with
the
terrible
question
what
is
my
unbiased
opinion
concerning
myself
pants
chiefly
for
fame
when
the
other
lung
is
found
diseased
the
diary
becomes
sometimes
more
serious
sometimes
more
fevered
she
is
almost
racked
to
find
some
end
in
life
shall
she
marry
or
paint
and
at
last
finds
much
consolation
in
the
visits
of
who
comes
to
see
her
often
while
he
is
dying
of
some
gastric
trouble
she
keeps
up
occasional
and
often
daily
entries
in
her
journal
until
eleven
days
before
her
death
occurring
in
october
at
the
age
of
and
precipitated
by
a
cold
incurred
while
making
an
sketch
the
confessional
outpourings
of
mary
maclane
constitute
a
unique
and
valuable
adolescent
document
despite
the
fact
that
it
seems
throughout
affected
and
written
for
effect
however
it
well
illustrates
a
real
type
although
perhaps
hardly
possible
save
in
this
country
and
was
inspired
very
likely
by
the
preceding
she
announces
at
the
outset
that
she
is
odd
a
genius
an
extreme
egotist
has
no
conscience
despises
her
father
jim
maclane
of
selfish
memory
loves
scrubbing
the
floor
because
it
gives
her
strength
and
grace
of
body
although
her
daily
life
is
an
empty
damned
weariness
she
is
a
female
napoleon
passionately
desiring
fame
is
both
a
philosopher
and
a
coward
her
heart
is
wooden
although
but
nineteen
she
feels
forty
desires
happiness
even
more
than
fame
for
an
hour
of
which
she
would
give
up
at
once
fame
money
power
virtue
honor
truth
and
genius
to
the
devil
whose
coming
she
awaits
she
discusses
her
portrait
which
constitutes
the
frontispiece
is
glad
of
her
good
strong
body
and
still
awaits
in
a
wild
frenzied
impatience
the
coming
of
the
devil
to
take
her
sacrifice
and
to
whom
she
would
dedicate
her
life
she
loves
but
one
in
all
the
world
an
older
anemone
lady
once
her
teacher
she
ran
not
distinguish
between
right
and
wrong
love
is
the
only
thing
real
which
will
some
day
bring
joy
but
it
is
agony
to
wait
oh
dame
damn
damn
damn
every
living
thing
in
the
world
the
universe
be
damned
herself
included
she
is
marvelously
deep
but
thanks
the
good
devil
who
has
made
her
without
conscience
and
virtue
so
that
she
may
take
her
happiness
when
it
comes
her
soul
seeks
but
blindly
for
nothing
answers
how
her
happiness
will
seethe
quiver
writhe
shine
dance
rush
surge
rage
blare
and
wreak
with
love
and
light
when
it
comes
the
devil
she
thinks
fascinating
and
strong
with
a
will
of
steel
conventional
clothes
whom
she
periodically
falls
in
love
with
and
would
marry
and
would
love
to
be
tortured
by
him
she
holds
imaginary
conversations
with
him
if
happiness
does
not
come
soon
she
will
commit
suicide
and
she
finds
rapture
in
the
thought
of
death
in
butte
montana
where
she
lives
she
wanders
among
the
box
rustlers
the
beer
jerkers
biscuit
shooters
and
plunges
out
into
the
sand
and
barrenness
but
finds
everything
dumb
the
six
toothbrushes
in
the
bathroom
make
her
wild
and
profane
she
flirts
with
death
at
the
top
of
a
dark
deep
pit
and
thinks
out
the
stages
of
decomposition
if
she
yielded
herself
to
death
who
would
dearly
love
to
have
her
she
confesses
herself
a
thief
on
several
occasions
but
comforts
herself
because
the
stolen
money
was
given
to
the
poor
sometimes
her
very
good
legs
carry
her
out
into
the
country
where
she
has
imaginary
love
confabs
with
the
devil
but
the
world
is
so
empty
dreary
and
cold
and
it
is
all
so
hard
to
bear
when
one
is
a
woman
and
nineteen
she
has
a
litany
from
which
she
prays
in
recurrent
phrases
kind
devil
deliver
me
as
from
musk
boys
with
curls
feminine
men
wobbly
hips
red
stockings
the
books
of
gunter
and
albert
ross
wax
flowers
soft
old
bachelors
and
widowers
nice
young
men
tin
spoons
false
teeth
thin
shoes
etc
she
does
not
seem
real
to
herself
everything
is
a
blank
though
she
doubts
everything
else
she
will
keep
the
one
atom
of
faith
in
love
and
the
truth
that
is
love
and
life
in
her
heart
when
something
shrieks
within
her
she
feels
that
all
her
anguish
is
for
nothing
and
that
she
is
a
fool
she
is
exasperated
that
people
call
her
peculiar
but
confesses
that
she
loves
admiration
she
can
fascinate
and
charm
company
if
she
tries
imagines
an
admiration
for
messalina
she
most
desires
to
cultivate
badness
when
there
is
lead
in
the
sky
i
would
live
about
seven
years
of
judicious
badness
and
then
death
if
you
will
i
long
to
cultivate
the
of
badness
in
me
she
describes
the
fascination
of
making
and
eating
fudge
devotes
a
chapter
to
describing
how
to
eat
an
olive
discusses
her
figure
in
the
front
of
my
there
are
nine
cambric
handkerchiefs
cunningly
distributed
she
discusses
her
foot
her
beautiful
hair
her
hips
describes
each
of
the
seventeen
little
engraved
portraits
of
napoleon
that
she
keeps
with
each
of
which
she
falls
in
love
vows
she
would
give
up
even
her
marvelous
genius
far
one
dear
bright
day
free
from
loneliness
when
her
skirts
need
sewing
she
simply
pins
them
this
lasts
longer
and
had
she
mended
them
with
needle
and
thread
she
would
have
been
sensible
which
she
hates
as
she
walks
over
the
sand
one
day
she
vows
that
she
would
like
a
man
to
come
so
be
that
he
was
strong
and
a
perfect
villain
and
she
would
pray
him
to
lead
her
to
what
the
world
calls
her
ruin
nothing
is
of
consequence
to
her
except
to
be
rid
of
unrest
and
pain
she
would
be
positively
and
not
merely
negatively
wicked
to
poison
her
soul
would
rouse
her
mental
power
oh
to
know
just
once
what
it
is
to
be
loved
i
know
that
i
am
a
genius
more
than
any
genius
that
has
lived
yet
she
often
thinks
herself
a
small
vile
creature
for
whom
no
one
cares
the
world
is
ineffably
dull
heaven
has
always
fooled
her
and
she
is
starving
for
love
ada
negri
illustrates
the
other
extreme
of
genuineness
and
is
desperately
in
earnest
she
began
to
teach
school
in
a
squalid
dismal
italian
village
and
at
eighteen
to
write
the
poetry
that
has
made
her
famous
she
lived
in
a
dim
room
back
of
a
stable
up
two
flights
where
the
windows
were
not
glass
but
paper
and
where
she
seems
to
have
been
like
her
mother
a
mill
head
before
she
was
a
teacher
she
had
never
seen
a
theater
but
had
read
of
duse
with
enthusiasm
had
never
seen
the
sea
mountain
or
even
a
hill
lake
or
large
city
but
she
had
read
of
them
after
she
began
to
write
friends
gave
her
two
dream
days
in
the
city
then
she
returned
put
on
her
wooden
shoes
and
began
to
teach
her
eighty
children
to
spell
the
poetry
she
writes
is
from
the
heart
of
her
own
experience
she
craved
the
kiss
of
genius
and
of
light
but
the
awful
figure
of
misfortune
with
its
dagger
stood
by
her
bed
at
night
she
writes
i
have
no
name
my
home
a
hovel
damp
i
grew
up
from
the
mire
wretched
and
outcast
folk
my
family
and
yet
within
me
burns
a
flame
of
fire
there
is
always
a
praying
angel
and
an
evil
dwarf
on
either
side
the
black
abyss
attracts
her
yet
she
is
softened
by
a
child
caress
she
laughs
at
the
blackest
calamities
that
threaten
her
but
weeps
over
thin
wan
children
without
bread
her
whole
life
goes
into
song
the
boy
criminal
on
the
street
fascinates
her
and
she
would
kiss
him
she
writes
of
jealousy
as
a
ghost
of
vengeance
if
death
comes
she
fears
that
the
haggard
doctor
will
dissect
my
naked
corpse
and
pictures
herself
dying
on
the
like
a
stray
dog
and
her
body
disgraced
by
the
lustful
kiss
of
the
too
eager
blade
as
with
sinister
smile
untiring
they
tear
my
bowels
out
and
still
gloat
over
my
sold
corpse
go
on
to
bare
my
bones
and
veins
at
will
wrench
out
my
heart
probe
vainly
for
the
secrets
of
hunger
and
the
mystery
of
pain
until
from
her
dead
breast
gurgles
a
gasp
of
malediction
much
of
her
verse
is
imprecation
a
crimson
rain
of
crying
blood
dripping
from
riddled
chests
of
those
slain
for
liberty
falls
on
her
heart
the
sultry
factories
where
monsters
of
steel
huge
engines
snort
all
day
and
where
the
pungent
air
poisons
the
blood
of
the
pale
weaver
girls
the
fate
of
the
mason
who
felt
from
a
high
roof
and
struck
the
stone
flagging
whose
funeral
she
attends
all
inspire
her
to
sing
occasionally
the
songs
of
enfranchised
labor
misery
as
a
drear
toothless
ghost
visits
her
as
when
gloomy
pinions
had
overspread
her
dying
mother
bed
to
wrench
with
sharp
nails
all
the
hope
from
her
breast
with
which
she
had
defied
it
a
wretched
old
man
on
the
street
inspires
her
to
sing
of
what
she
imagines
is
his
happy
though
humble
prime
there
is
the
song
of
the
pickaxe
brandished
in
revolution
when
mobs
cry
peace
labor
bread
and
in
mines
of
industry
beneath
the
earth
she
loves
the
defeated
in
whose
house
no
fire
glows
who
live
in
caves
and
dens
and
writes
of
the
mutilation
of
a
woman
in
the
factory
machinery
at
eighteen
years
a
loom
two
handsome
eyes
that
know
no
tears
a
cotton
dress
a
love
belong
to
me
she
is
inspired
by
a
master
of
the
forge
beating
a
bar
with
his
bare
neck
swelled
he
is
her
demon
her
god
and
her
pride
in
him
is
ecstasy
she
describes
jealousy
of
two
rival
women
so
intense
that
they
fight
and
bite
and
the
pure
joy
of
a
guileless
intoxicating
first
kiss
she
longs
for
infinite
stretches
of
hot
golden
sand
over
which
she
would
gallop
wildly
on
her
steed
anticipates
an
old
age
of
cap
and
spectacles
revels
in
the
hurricane
and
would
rise
in
and
fly
and
whirl
with
it
adrift
far
out
in
the
immensity
of
space
she
tells
us
of
genius
and
light
i
a
blithe
millionaire
and
elsewhere
she
longs
for
the
everlasting
ice
of
lofty
mountains
the
immortal
silence
of
the
alps
sings
of
her
sad
twenty
years
how
all
all
goes
when
love
is
gone
and
spent
she
imagines
herself
springing
into
the
water
which
closes
over
her
while
her
naked
soul
ghostly
pale
whirls
past
through
the
lonely
dale
she
imprecates
the
licentious
world
of
crafty
burghers
coquettes
gamblers
millionaires
cursed
geese
and
serpents
that
make
the
cowardly
vile
world
and
whom
she
would
smite
in
the
face
with
her
indignant
verse
thou
crawlest
and
i
soar
she
chants
the
champions
of
the
spade
hammer
pick
though
they
are
ground
and
bowed
with
toil
disfigured
within
with
furrowed
brows
she
pants
for
war
with
outrage
and
with
wrong
questions
the
abyss
for
its
secret
hears
moans
and
flying
shudders
and
sees
phantoms
springing
from
putrid
tombs
the
full
moon
is
an
old
malicious
spy
peeping
stealthily
with
evil
eye
she
is
a
bird
caught
in
a
cursed
cage
and
prays
some
one
to
unlock
the
door
and
give
her
space
and
light
and
let
her
soar
away
in
ecstasy
and
glory
nothing
less
than
infinite
space
will
satisfy
her
even
the
tempest
the
demon
or
a
malevolent
spirit
might
bear
her
away
on
unbridled
wings
in
one
poem
she
apostrophizes
marie
bashkirtseff
as
warring
with
vast
genius
against
unknown
powers
but
who
now
is
in
her
coffin
among
worms
her
skull
grinning
and
showing
its
teeth
she
would
be
possessed
by
her
and
thrilled
as
by
an
electric
current
a
dwarf
beggar
wrings
her
heart
with
pity
but
she
will
not
be
overwhelmed
though
a
daring
peasant
she
will
be
free
and
sing
out
her
pæan
to
the
sun
though
amid
the
infernal
glow
of
furnaces
forges
and
the
ringing
noise
of
hammers
and
wheels
literary
men
who
record
their
experiences
during
this
stage
seem
to
differ
from
women
in
several
important
respects
first
they
write
with
less
abandon
i
can
recall
no
male
maclanes
a
bashkirtseff
would
be
less
impossible
and
a
negri
with
social
reform
in
her
heart
is
still
less
so
but
men
are
more
prone
to
characterize
their
public
metamorphoses
later
in
life
when
they
are
a
little
paled
and
perhaps
feel
less
need
of
confessionalism
for
that
reason
it
would
however
be
too
hazardous
to
elaborate
this
distinction
too
far
secondly
and
more
clearly
men
tend
to
vent
their
ephebic
calentures
more
in
the
field
of
action
they
would
break
the
old
moorings
of
home
and
strike
out
new
careers
or
vent
their
souls
in
efforts
and
dreams
of
reconstructing
the
political
industrial
or
social
world
their
impracticabilities
are
more
often
in
the
field
of
practical
life
and
remoter
from
their
own
immediate
surroundings
this
is
especially
true
in
our
practical
country
which
so
far
lacks
subjective
characterizations
of
this
age
of
eminent
literary
merit
peculiarly
intense
as
it
is
here
thirdly
they
erupt
in
a
greater
variety
of
ways
and
the
many
kinds
of
genius
and
talent
that
now
often
take
possession
of
their
lives
like
fate
are
more
varied
and
individual
this
affords
many
extreme
contrasts
as
between
trollope
pity
for
and
goethe
apotheosis
of
his
youth
mill
loss
of
feeling
and
jefferies
unanalytic
passionate
outbursts
of
sentiment
the
esthetic
ritualism
of
symonds
and
the
progressive
religious
emancipation
of
fielding
hall
the
moral
and
religious
supersensitiveness
of
oliphant
who
was
a
reincarnation
of
medieval
monkhood
and
the
riotous
storminess
of
müller
and
ebers
the
abnormalities
and
precocity
of
de
quincey
and
the
steady
healthful
growth
of
patterson
the
simultaneity
of
a
fleshly
and
spiritual
love
in
keller
and
goethe
and
the
duality
of
pater
with
his
great
and
tyrannical
intensification
of
sensation
for
nature
and
the
sequent
mysticity
and
symbolism
in
some
it
is
fulminating
but
episodic
in
others
gradual
and
lifelong
like
the
advent
of
eternal
spring
fourth
in
their
subjective
states
women
outgrow
less
in
their
consciousness
and
men
depart
farther
from
their
youth
in
more
manifold
ways
lastly
in
its
religious
aspects
the
male
struggles
more
with
dogma
and
his
enfranchisement
from
it
is
more
intellectually
belabored
yet
despite
all
these
differences
the
analogies
between
the
sexes
are
probably
yet
more
numerous
more
all
these
biographic
facts
reveal
nothing
not
found
in
returns
from
more
ordinary
youth
so
that
for
our
purposes
they
are
only
the
latter
writ
large
because
superior
minds
only
utter
what
all
more
inwardly
feel
the
arrangement
by
nationality
which
follows
gives
no
yet
adequate
basis
for
inference
unless
it
be
the
above
american
peculiarity
in
his
autobiography
from
de
quincey
remembered
feeling
that
life
was
finished
and
blighted
for
him
at
the
age
of
six
up
to
which
time
the
influence
of
his
sister
three
years
older
had
brooded
over
him
his
first
remembrance
however
is
of
a
dream
of
terrific
grandeur
before
he
was
two
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
his
dream
tendencies
were
constitutional
and
not
due
to
morphine
but
the
chill
was
upon
the
first
glimpse
that
this
was
a
world
of
evil
he
had
been
brought
up
in
great
seclusion
from
all
knowledge
of
poverty
and
oppression
in
a
silent
garden
with
three
sisters
but
the
rumor
that
a
female
servant
had
treated
one
of
them
rudely
just
before
her
death
plunged
him
into
early
pessimism
he
felt
that
little
jane
would
come
back
certainly
in
the
spring
with
the
roses
and
he
was
glad
that
his
utter
misery
with
the
blank
anarchy
confusion
which
her
death
brought
could
not
be
completely
remembered
he
stole
into
the
chamber
where
her
corpse
lay
and
as
he
stood
a
solemn
wind
the
saddest
he
ever
heard
that
might
have
swept
the
fields
of
mortality
for
a
thousand
centuries
blew
and
that
same
hollow
memnonian
wind
he
often
had
heard
since
and
it
brought
back
the
open
summer
window
and
the
corpse
a
vault
above
opened
into
the
sky
and
he
slept
and
dreamed
there
standing
by
her
he
knew
not
how
long
a
worm
that
could
not
die
was
at
his
heart
for
this
was
the
holy
love
between
children
that
could
not
perish
the
funeral
was
full
of
darkness
and
despair
for
him
and
after
it
he
sought
solitude
gazed
into
the
heavens
to
see
his
sister
till
he
was
tired
and
realized
that
he
was
alone
thus
before
the
end
of
his
sixth
year
with
a
mind
already
adolescent
although
with
a
retarded
body
the
minor
tone
of
life
became
dominant
and
his
awakening
to
it
was
hard
as
a
penniless
schoolboy
wandering
the
streets
of
london
at
night
he
was
on
familiar
and
friendly
terms
of
innocent
relationship
with
a
number
of
outcast
women
in
his
misery
they
were
to
him
simply
sisters
in
calamity
but
he
found
in
them
humanity
disinterested
generosity
courage
and
fidelity
one
night
after
he
had
walked
the
streets
for
weeks
with
one
of
these
friendless
girls
who
had
not
completed
her
sixteenth
year
as
they
sat
on
the
steps
of
a
house
he
grew
very
ill
and
had
she
not
rushed
to
buy
from
her
slender
purse
cordials
and
tenderly
ministered
to
and
revived
him
he
would
have
died
many
years
later
he
used
to
wander
past
this
house
and
he
recalled
with
real
tenderness
this
youthful
friendship
he
longed
again
to
meet
the
ann
with
whom
he
had
so
often
conversed
familiarly
whose
betrayer
he
had
vainly
sought
to
punish
and
yearned
to
hear
from
her
in
order
to
convey
to
her
some
authentic
message
of
gratitude
peace
and
forgiveness
his
much
older
brother
came
home
in
his
year
to
die
he
had
been
unmanageable
in
youth
and
his
genius
for
mischief
was
an
inspiration
yet
he
was
hostile
to
everything
pusillanimous
haughty
aspiring
ready
to
fasten
a
quarrel
on
his
shadow
for
running
before
at
first
inclined
to
reduce
his
boy
brother
to
a
fag
but
finally
before
his
death
became
a
great
influence
in
his
life
prominent
were
the
fights
between
de
quincey
and
another
older
brother
on
the
one
hand
and
the
factory
crowd
of
boys
on
the
other
a
fight
incessantly
renewed
at
the
close
of
factory
hours
with
victory
now
on
one
and
now
on
the
other
side
fought
with
stones
and
sticks
where
thrice
he
was
taken
prisoner
where
once
one
of
the
factory
women
kissed
him
to
the
great
delight
of
his
heart
he
finally
invented
a
kingdom
like
hartley
coleridge
called
gom
broon
he
thought
first
that
it
had
no
location
but
finally
because
his
brother
imaginary
realm
was
north
and
he
wanted
wide
water
between
them
his
was
in
the
far
south
it
was
only
two
hundred
and
seventy
miles
in
circuit
and
he
was
stunned
to
be
told
by
his
brother
one
day
that
his
own
domain
swept
south
for
eighty
degrees
so
that
the
distance
he
had
relied
on
vanished
here
however
he
continued
to
rule
for
well
or
ill
raising
taxes
keeping
an
imaginary
standing
army
fishing
herring
and
selling
the
product
of
his
fishery
for
manure
and
experiencing
how
uneasy
lies
the
head
that
wears
a
crown
he
worried
over
his
obligations
to
gom
broon
and
the
shadow
froze
into
reality
and
although
his
brother
kingdom
tigrosylvania
was
larger
his
was
distinguished
for
eminent
men
and
a
history
not
to
be
ashamed
of
a
friend
had
read
lord
monboddo
view
that
men
had
sprung
from
apes
and
suggested
that
the
inhabitants
of
gom
broon
had
tails
so
that
the
brother
told
him
that
his
subjects
had
not
emerged
from
apedom
and
he
must
invent
arts
to
eliminate
the
tails
they
must
be
made
to
sit
down
for
six
hours
a
day
as
a
beginning
abdicate
he
would
not
though
all
his
subjects
had
three
tails
apiece
they
had
suffered
together
vain
was
his
suggestion
that
they
have
a
roman
toga
to
conceal
their
ignominious
appendages
he
was
greatly
interested
in
two
scrofulous
idiots
who
finally
died
and
feared
that
his
subjects
were
akin
to
them
john
stuart
mill
autobiography
presents
one
of
the
most
remarkable
modifications
of
the
later
phases
of
adolescent
experience
no
boy
ever
had
more
diligent
and
earnest
training
than
his
father
gave
him
or
responded
better
he
can
not
remember
when
he
began
to
learn
greek
but
was
told
that
it
was
at
the
age
of
three
the
list
of
classical
authors
alone
that
he
read
in
the
original
to
say
nothing
of
history
political
scientific
logical
and
other
works
before
he
was
twelve
is
perhaps
unprecedented
in
all
history
he
associated
with
his
father
and
all
his
many
friends
on
their
own
level
but
modestly
ascribes
everything
to
his
environment
insists
that
in
natural
gifts
he
is
other
below
than
above
par
and
declares
that
everything
he
did
could
be
done
by
every
boy
of
average
capacity
and
healthy
physical
constitution
his
father
made
the
greek
virtue
of
temperance
or
moderation
cardinal
and
thought
human
life
a
poor
thing
at
best
after
the
freshness
of
youth
and
unsatisfied
curiosity
had
gone
by
he
scorned
the
intense
and
had
only
contempt
for
strong
emotion
in
his
teens
mill
was
an
able
debater
and
writer
for
the
quarterlies
and
devoted
to
the
propagation
of
the
theories
of
bentham
ricardo
and
associationism
from
the
age
of
fifteen
he
had
an
object
in
life
to
reform
the
world
this
gave
him
happiness
deep
permanent
and
assured
for
the
future
and
the
idea
of
struggling
to
promote
utilitarianism
seemed
an
inspiring
program
for
life
but
in
the
autumn
of
when
he
was
twenty
years
of
age
he
felt
into
a
dull
state
of
nerves
where
he
could
no
longer
enjoy
and
what
had
produced
pleasure
seemed
insipid
the
state
i
should
think
in
which
converts
to
methodism
usually
are
when
smitten
by
their
first
of
sin
in
this
frame
of
mind
it
occurred
to
me
to
put
the
question
directly
to
myself
that
all
your
objects
in
life
were
realized
that
all
the
changes
in
institutions
and
opinions
which
you
are
looking
forward
to
could
be
completely
effected
at
this
very
instant
would
this
be
a
great
joy
and
happiness
to
you
and
an
irrepressible
distinctly
answered
at
this
my
heart
sank
within
me
the
whole
foundation
on
which
my
life
was
constructed
fell
down
all
my
happiness
was
to
have
been
found
in
the
continual
pursuit
of
this
end
the
end
had
ceased
to
charm
and
how
could
there
ever
again
be
any
interest
in
the
means
i
seemed
to
have
nothing
left
to
live
for
at
first
i
hoped
that
the
cloud
would
pass
away
of
itself
but
it
did
not
a
night
sleep
the
sovereign
remedy
for
the
smaller
vexations
of
life
had
no
effect
on
it
i
awoke
to
a
renewed
consciousness
of
the
woful
fact
i
carried
it
with
me
into
all
companies
into
all
occupations
hardly
anything
had
power
to
cause
me
even
a
few
minutes
oblivion
of
it
for
some
months
the
cloud
seemed
to
grow
thicker
and
thicker
the
lines
in
coleridge
i
was
not
then
acquainted
with
them
exactly
described
my
case
grief
without
a
pang
void
dark
and
drear
a
drowsy
stifled
unimpassioned
grief
which
finds
no
natural
outlet
or
relief
in
word
or
sigh
or
tear
in
vain
i
sought
relief
from
my
favorite
books
those
memorials
of
past
nobleness
and
greatness
from
which
i
had
always
hitherto
drawn
strength
and
animation
i
read
them
now
without
feeling
or
with
the
accustomed
feeling
minus
all
its
charm
and
i
became
persuaded
that
my
love
of
mankind
and
of
excellence
for
its
own
sake
had
worn
itself
out
i
sought
no
comfort
by
speaking
to
others
of
what
i
felt
if
i
had
loved
any
one
sufficiently
to
make
confiding
my
griefs
a
necessity
i
should
not
have
been
in
the
condition
i
was
i
felt
too
that
mine
was
not
an
interesting
or
in
anyway
respectable
distress
there
was
nothing
in
it
to
attract
sympathy
advice
if
i
had
known
where
to
seek
it
would
have
been
most
precious
the
words
of
macbeth
to
the
physician
often
occurred
to
my
thoughts
but
there
was
no
one
on
whom
i
could
build
the
faintest
hope
of
such
assistance
my
father
to
whom
it
would
have
been
natural
to
me
to
have
recourse
in
any
practical
difficulties
was
the
last
person
to
whom
in
such
a
case
as
this
i
looked
for
help
everything
convinced
me
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
any
such
mental
state
as
i
was
suffering
from
and
that
even
if
he
could
be
made
to
understand
it
he
was
not
the
physician
who
could
heal
it
my
education
which
was
wholly
his
work
had
been
conducted
without
any
regard
to
the
possibility
of
its
ending
in
this
result
and
i
saw
no
use
in
giving
him
the
pain
of
thinking
that
his
plans
had
failed
when
the
failure
was
probably
irremediable
and
at
all
event
beyond
the
power
of
his
remedies
of
other
friends
i
had
at
that
time
none
to
whom
i
had
any
hope
of
making
my
condition
intelligible
it
was
however
abundantly
intelligible
to
myself
and
the
more
i
dwelt
upon
it
the
more
hopeless
it
appeared
he
now
saw
what
had
hitherto
seemed
incredible
that
the
habit
of
analysis
tends
to
wear
away
the
feelings
he
felt
stranded
at
the
commencement
of
my
voyage
with
a
ship
and
a
rudder
but
no
sail
without
any
real
desire
for
the
ends
which
i
had
been
so
carefully
fitted
out
to
work
for
no
delight
in
virtue
or
the
general
good
but
also
just
as
little
in
anything
else
the
fountains
of
vanity
and
ambition
seemed
to
have
dried
up
within
me
as
completely
as
those
of
benevolence
his
vanity
had
been
gratified
at
too
early
an
age
and
like
all
premature
pleasures
they
had
caused
indifference
until
he
despaired
of
creating
any
fresh
association
of
pleasure
with
any
objects
of
human
dire
meanwhile
dejected
and
melancholy
as
he
was
through
the
winter
he
went
on
mechanically
with
his
tasks
thought
he
found
in
coleridge
the
first
description
of
what
he
was
feeling
feared
the
idiosyncrasies
of
his
education
had
made
him
a
being
unique
and
apart
i
asked
myself
if
i
could
or
if
i
was
bound
to
go
on
living
when
life
must
be
passed
in
this
manner
i
generally
answered
to
myself
that
i
did
not
think
i
could
possibly
bear
it
beyond
a
year
but
within
about
half
that
time
in
reading
a
pathetic
page
of
how
a
mere
boy
felt
that
he
could
save
his
family
and
take
the
place
of
all
they
had
lost
a
vivid
conception
of
the
scene
came
over
him
and
he
was
moved
to
tears
from
that
moment
his
burden
grew
lighter
he
saw
that
his
heart
was
not
dead
and
that
he
still
had
some
stuff
left
of
which
character
and
happiness
are
made
and
although
there
were
several
later
lapses
some
of
which
lasted
many
months
he
was
never
again
as
miserable
as
he
had
been
these
experience
left
him
changed
in
two
respects
he
had
a
new
theory
of
life
having
much
in
common
with
the
theory
of
carlyle
he
still
held
happiness
the
end
of
life
but
thought
it
must
be
aimed
at
indirectly
and
taken
incidentally
the
other
change
was
that
for
the
first
time
he
gave
its
proper
place
to
internal
culture
of
the
individual
especially
the
training
of
the
feelings
which
became
now
cardinal
he
relished
and
felt
the
power
of
poetry
and
art
was
profoundly
moved
by
music
fell
in
love
with
wordsworth
and
with
nature
and
his
later
depressions
were
best
relieved
by
the
power
of
rural
beauty
which
wrought
its
charm
not
because
of
itself
but
by
the
states
and
feelings
it
aroused
his
ode
on
the
intimations
of
immortality
showed
that
he
also
had
felt
that
the
first
freshness
of
youthful
joy
was
not
lasting
and
had
sought
and
found
compensation
he
had
thus
come
to
a
very
different
standpoint
from
that
of
his
father
who
had
up
to
this
time
formed
his
mind
and
life
and
developed
on
this
basis
his
unique
individuality
jefferies
when
eighteen
began
his
story
of
my
heart
which
he
said
was
an
absolutely
true
confession
of
the
stages
of
emotion
in
a
soul
from
which
all
traces
of
tradition
and
learning
were
erased
and
which
stood
face
to
face
with
nature
and
the
unknown
his
heart
long
seemed
dusty
and
parched
for
want
of
feeling
and
he
frequented
a
hill
where
the
pores
of
his
soul
opened
to
a
new
air
lying
down
on
the
grass
i
spoke
in
my
soul
to
the
earth
the
sun
the
air
and
the
distant
sea
i
desired
to
have
its
strength
its
mystery
and
glory
i
addressed
the
sun
desiring
the
sole
equivalent
of
his
light
and
brilliance
his
endurance
and
unwearied
race
i
turned
to
the
blue
heaven
over
gazing
into
its
depth
inhaling
its
exquisite
color
and
sweetness
the
rich
blue
of
the
unobtainable
flower
of
the
sky
drew
my
soul
toward
it
and
there
it
rested
for
pure
color
is
the
rest
of
the
heart
by
all
these
i
prayed
i
felt
an
emotion
of
the
soul
beyond
all
definition
prayer
is
a
puny
thing
to
it
he
prayed
by
the
thyme
by
the
earth
the
flowers
which
he
touched
the
dust
which
he
let
fall
through
his
fingers
was
filled
with
a
rapture
an
ecstasy
an
inflatus
with
this
inflatus
i
prayed
i
hid
my
face
in
the
grass
i
was
wholly
prostrated
i
lost
myself
in
the
wrestle
i
see
now
that
what
i
labored
for
was
soul
life
more
soul
learning
after
gazing
upward
he
would
turn
his
face
into
the
grass
shutting
out
everything
with
hands
each
side
till
he
felt
down
into
the
earth
and
was
absorbed
in
it
whispering
deep
down
to
its
center
every
natural
impression
trees
insects
air
clouds
he
used
for
prayer
that
my
soul
might
be
more
than
the
cosmos
of
life
his
lyra
prayer
was
to
live
a
more
exalted
and
intense
soul
life
enjoy
more
bodily
pleasure
and
live
long
and
find
power
to
execute
his
designs
he
often
tried
but
failed
for
years
to
write
at
least
a
meager
account
of
these
experiences
he
felt
himself
immortal
just
as
he
felt
beauty
he
was
in
eternity
already
the
supernatural
is
only
the
natural
misnamed
as
he
lay
face
down
on
the
grass
seizing
it
with
both
hands
he
longed
for
death
to
be
burned
on
a
pyre
of
pine
wood
on
a
high
hill
to
have
his
ashes
scattered
wide
and
broadcast
to
be
thrown
into
the
space
he
longed
for
while
living
but
he
feared
that
such
a
luxury
of
resolution
into
the
elements
would
be
too
costly
thus
his
naked
mind
close
against
naked
mother
nature
wrested
from
her
the
conviction
of
soul
immortality
deity
under
conditions
as
primitive
as
those
of
the
cave
man
and
his
most
repeated
prayer
was
give
me
the
deepest
soul
life
in
other
moods
he
felt
the
world
and
his
mind
could
by
no
twist
be
fitted
to
the
cosmos
ugly
designless
creatures
caused
him
to
cease
to
look
for
deity
in
nature
where
all
happens
by
chance
he
at
length
concluded
there
is
something
higher
than
soul
and
above
deity
and
better
than
god
for
which
he
searched
and
labored
he
found
favorite
thinking
places
to
which
he
made
pilgrimages
where
he
felt
out
into
the
depths
of
the
ether
his
frame
could
not
bear
the
labor
his
heart
demanded
work
of
body
was
his
meat
and
drink
never
have
i
had
enough
of
it
i
wearied
long
before
i
was
satisfied
and
weariness
did
not
bring
a
cessation
of
desire
the
thirst
was
still
there
i
rode
i
used
the
ax
i
split
with
wedges
my
arms
tired
but
my
spirit
remained
fresh
and
chafed
against
the
physical
weariness
had
he
been
indefinitely
stronger
he
would
have
longed
for
more
strength
he
was
often
out
of
doors
all
day
and
often
half
the
night
wanted
more
sunshine
wished
the
day
was
sixty
hours
long
took
pleasure
in
braving
the
cold
so
that
it
should
be
not
destroyer
but
its
renewer
yet
he
abhorred
asceticism
he
wrestled
with
the
problem
of
the
origin
of
his
soul
and
destiny
but
could
find
no
solution
revolted
at
the
assertion
that
all
is
designed
for
the
best
a
man
of
intellect
and
humanity
could
cause
everything
to
happen
in
an
infinitely
superior
manner
he
discovered
that
no
one
ever
died
of
old
age
but
only
of
disease
that
we
do
not
even
know
what
old
age
would
be
like
found
that
his
soul
is
infinite
but
lies
in
abeyance
that
we
are
murdered
by
our
ancestors
and
must
roll
back
the
tide
of
death
that
a
hundredth
part
of
man
labor
would
suffice
for
his
support
that
idleness
is
no
evil
that
in
the
future
of
the
time
will
be
leisure
and
to
that
end
he
will
work
with
all
his
heart
i
was
not
more
than
eighteen
when
an
inner
and
esoteric
meaning
began
to
come
to
me
from
all
the
visible
universe
and
indefinable
aspirations
filled
me
interesting
as
is
this
document
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
the
suspicion
that
the
seventeen
years
which
intervened
between
the
beginning
of
these
experiences
and
their
final
record
coupled
with
the
perhaps
unconscious
tendency
toward
literary
effect
detract
more
or
less
from
their
value
as
documents
of
adolescent
nature
fielding
hall
author
of
the
soul
of
a
people
has
since
written
a
book
in
which
beginning
with
many
definitions
of
christianity
weighing
the
opinion
of
those
who
think
all
our
advance
is
made
because
of
against
those
who
think
it
in
spite
of
christianity
he
proceeds
to
give
the
story
of
a
boy
probably
himself
who
till
twelve
was
almost
entirely
reared
by
women
and
with
children
younger
than
himself
he
was
sickly
and
believed
not
in
the
old
but
in
the
new
testament
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
which
he
supposed
all
accepted
and
lived
by
that
war
and
wealth
were
bad
and
learning
apt
to
be
a
snare
that
the
ideal
life
was
that
of
a
poor
curate
working
hard
and
unhappy
at
twelve
he
went
to
a
passed
from
a
woman
world
into
a
man
out
of
the
new
testament
into
the
old
out
of
dreams
into
reality
war
was
a
glorious
opportunity
and
all
followed
the
british
victories
which
were
announced
publicly
big
boys
were
going
to
sandhurst
or
woolwich
there
were
parties
and
the
school
code
never
turned
the
other
cheek
wars
were
god
storms
stirring
stagnant
natures
to
new
life
wealth
was
worshiped
certain
lies
were
an
honor
knowledge
was
an
extremely
desirable
thing
all
this
was
at
first
new
and
delightful
but
extremely
wicked
sunday
was
the
only
other
old
testament
rule
but
was
then
forgotten
slowly
a
repugnance
of
religion
in
all
its
forms
arose
he
felt
his
teachers
hypocrites
he
raised
no
alarm
for
he
was
hardly
conscious
that
his
anchor
had
dragged
or
that
he
had
lost
hold
of
it
forever
at
eighteen
he
read
darwin
and
found
that
if
he
were
right
genesis
was
wrong
man
had
risen
not
fallen
if
a
part
was
wrong
the
whole
was
if
god
made
the
world
the
devil
seemed
to
rule
it
prayer
can
not
influence
him
the
seven
days
of
creation
were
periods
heaven
knows
how
long
why
did
all
profess
and
no
one
believe
religion
why
is
god
so
stern
and
yet
so
partial
and
how
about
the
trinity
then
explanations
were
given
heaven
grew
repulsive
as
a
place
for
the
poor
the
maimed
the
stupid
the
childish
and
those
unfit
for
earth
generally
faiths
came
from
the
east
the
north
has
originated
only
thor
odin
balder
valkyres
the
gloom
and
cold
drive
man
into
himself
do
not
open
him
in
the
east
one
can
live
in
quiet
solitude
with
no
effort
close
to
nature
the
representatives
of
all
faiths
wear
ostentatiously
their
badges
pray
in
public
and
no
one
sneers
at
all
religions
oriental
faiths
have
no
organization
there
is
no
head
of
hinduism
buddhism
or
hardly
of
mohammedanism
there
are
no
missions
but
religion
grows
rankly
from
a
rich
soil
so
the
boy
wrote
three
demands
a
reasonable
theory
of
the
universe
a
workable
and
working
code
of
conduct
and
a
promise
of
something
desirable
hereafter
so
he
read
books
and
tried
to
make
a
system
on
a
hill
in
a
in
the
east
he
realized
how
thor
was
born
man
fears
thunder
it
seems
the
voice
of
a
greater
man
deny
eyes
legs
and
body
of
the
deity
and
nothing
is
left
god
as
an
abstract
spirit
is
unthinkable
but
buddhism
offers
us
no
god
only
law
necessity
blind
force
law
or
a
free
personal
will
that
is
the
alternative
freedom
limits
omnipotence
the
two
can
never
mix
the
german
emperor
god
clanking
round
the
heavenly
mansions
wearing
a
german
and
swearing
german
oaths
is
not
satisfactory
man
god
is
what
he
admires
most
in
himself
he
can
be
propitiated
hence
atonement
you
can
not
break
a
law
but
you
can
study
it
inquiry
not
submission
is
the
attitude
perhaps
both
destiny
and
freedom
are
true
but
truth
is
for
the
sake
of
light
thor
had
no
moral
code
the
greeks
were
unmoral
jehovah
at
first
asked
only
fear
reverence
and
worship
this
gives
no
guide
to
life
most
codes
are
directed
against
a
foe
and
against
pain
truth
mercy
courtesy
these
were
slowly
added
to
reverence
then
sanitary
rules
hence
castes
two
codes
those
of
christ
and
buddha
tower
above
all
others
they
are
the
same
in
praising
not
wealth
greatness
or
power
but
purity
renunciation
of
the
world
as
if
one
fitted
one
self
for
one
by
being
unfitted
for
the
other
world
is
heaven
a
bribe
its
ideals
are
those
of
children
of
girl
angels
white
wings
floating
dresses
no
sheep
but
lambs
surely
there
is
nothing
in
all
the
world
so
babyish
one
can
hardly
imagine
a
man
with
a
deep
voice
with
the
storm
of
life
beating
his
soul
amid
those
baby
faces
if
happiness
in
any
act
or
attitude
is
perfect
it
will
last
forever
where
is
due
the
weariness
or
satiety
but
if
happiness
be
perfect
this
is
impossible
so
life
would
be
monotony
akin
to
annihilation
but
life
is
change
and
change
is
misery
there
is
effort
here
but
there
will
be
none
in
the
great
peace
that
passes
understanding
no
defeat
therefore
no
victory
no
friends
because
no
enemies
no
joyous
meetings
because
no
farewells
it
is
the
shadows
and
the
dark
mysteries
that
sound
the
depths
of
our
hearts
no
man
that
ever
lived
if
told
that
he
could
be
young
again
or
go
to
any
heaven
would
choose
the
latter
men
die
for
many
things
but
all
fear
the
beyond
thus
no
religion
gives
us
an
intelligible
first
cause
a
code
or
a
heaven
that
we
want
the
most
religious
man
is
the
peasant
listening
to
the
angelus
putting
out
a
little
for
his
god
the
woman
crying
in
the
pagoda
thus
we
can
only
turn
to
the
hearts
of
men
for
the
truth
of
religion
biographies
and
autobiographies
furnish
many
photographic
glimpses
of
the
struggles
and
experiences
of
early
adolescent
years
anthony
trollope
autobiography
is
pitiful
he
was
poor
and
disliked
by
most
of
his
masters
and
treated
with
ignominy
by
his
fellow
pupils
he
describes
himself
as
always
in
disgrace
at
fifteen
he
walked
three
miles
each
way
twice
a
day
to
and
from
school
as
a
sizar
he
seemed
a
wretched
farmer
boy
reeking
from
the
dunghill
sitting
next
the
sons
of
big
peers
all
were
against
him
and
he
was
allowed
to
join
no
games
and
learned
he
tells
us
absolutely
nothing
but
a
little
greek
and
latin
once
only
goaded
to
desperation
he
rallied
and
whipped
a
bully
the
boy
was
never
able
to
overcome
the
isolation
of
his
school
position
and
while
he
coveted
popularity
with
an
eagerness
which
was
almost
mean
and
longed
exceedingly
to
excel
in
cricket
or
with
the
racquet
was
allowed
to
know
nothing

at
nineteen
never

him
he
believes
that
he
has
been
flogged
oftener
than
any
human
being
alive
it
was
just
possible
to
obtain
five
scourgings
in
one
day
at
winchester
and
i
have
often
boasted
that
i
have
obtained
them
all
prizes
were
distributed
prodigally
but
he
never
got
one
for
twelve
years
of
tuition
he
says
i
do
not
remember
that
i
ever
knew
a
lesson
at
this
age
he
describes
himself
as
an
idle
desolate
hanger
on
without
an
idea
of
a
career
or
a
profession
or
a
trade
but
he
was
tolerably
happy
because
he
could
fancy
himself
in
love
with
pretty
girls
and
had
been
removed
from
the
real
misery
of
school
but
had
not
a
single
aspiration
regarding
his
future
three
of
his
household
were
dying
of
consumption
and
his
mother
was
day
nurse
night
nurse
and
divided
her
time
between
and
the
for
when
she
was
she
had
written
one
hundred
and
forty
volumes
the
first
of
which
was
not
written
till
she
was
fifty
gradually
the
boy
became
alive
to
the
blighted
ambition
of
his
father
life
and
the
strain
his
mother
was
enduring
nursing
the

he

french
nor
science
was
a
bad
speller
and
worse
writer
and
could
not
have
sustained
an
examination
on
any
subject
still
he
could
not
bear
idleness
and
was
always
going
about
with
some
castle
in
the
air
finely
built
in
his
mind
carrying
on
for
weeks
and
years
the
same
continuous
story
binding
himself
down
to
certain
laws
proprieties
and
unities
always
his
own
hero
excluding
everything
violently
improbable
to
this
practise
which
he
calls
dangerous
and
which
began
six
or
seven
years
before
he
went
to
the
he
ascribes
his
power
to
maintain
an
interest
in
a
fictitious
story
and
to
live
in
a
entirely
outside
imaginative
life
during
these
seven
years
he
acquired
a
character
of
irregularity
and
grew
reckless
mark
pattison
shows
us
how
his
real
life
began
in
the
middle
teens
when
his
energy
was
directed
to
one
end
to
improve
myself
to
form
my
own
mind
to
sound
things
thoroughly
to
be
free
from
the
bondage
of
unreason
and
the
traditional
prejudices
which
when
i
first
began
to
think
constituted
the
whole
of
my
mental
fabric
he
entered
upon
life
with
a
and
contracted
intellect
and
depicts
something
of
the
steps
by
which
i
emerged
from
that
frozen
condition
he
believes
that
to
remember
the
dreams
and
confusions
of
childhood
and
never
to
lose
the
recollection
of
the
curiosity
and
simplicity
of
that
age
is
one
of
the
great
gifts
of
the
poetic
character
although
this
he
tells
us
was
extraordinarily
true
of
george
sand
but
not
of
himself
from
the
age
of
twelve
on
a
fellowship
at
oriel
was
the
ideal
of
his
life
and
although
he
became
a
commoner
there
at
seventeen
his
chief
marvel
is
that
he
was
so
immature
and
unimpressionable
william
hale
white
learned
little
at
school
save
latin
and
good
penmanship
but
his
very
life
was
divided
into
halves
sundays
and
week
days
and
he
reflects
at
some
length
upon
the
immense
dangers
of
the
early
teens
the
physiological
and
yet
subtler
psychic
penalties
of
error
callousness
to
fine
pleasures
hardening
of
the
conscience
and
deplores
the
misery
which
a
little
instruction
might
have
saved
him
at
fourteen
he
underwent
conversion
understood
in
his
sect
to
be
a
transforming
miracle
releasing
higher
and
imprisoning
lower
powers
he
compares
it
to
the
saving
of
a
mind
from
vice
by
falling
in
love
with
a
woman
who
is
adored
or
the
reclamation
of
a
young
woman
from
idleness
and
vanity
by
motherhood
but
as
a
boy
he
was
convinced
of
many
things
which
were
mere
phrases
and
attended
for
the
clanship
of
being
marked
off
from
the
world
and
of
walking
home
with
certain
girls
he
learned
to
say
in
prayer
that
there
was
nothing
good
in
him
that
he
was
rotten
and
filthy
and
his
soul
a
mass
of
putrefying
sores
but
no
one
took
him
at
his
word
and
expelled
him
from
society
but
thought
the
better
of
him
soon
he
began
to
study
theology
but
found
no
help
in
suppressing
tempestuous
lust
in
understanding
the
bible
or
getting
his
doubts
answered
and
all
the
lectures
seemed
irrelevant
chattering
an
infidel
was
a
monster
whom
he
had
rarely
ever
seen
at
nineteen
he
began
to
preach
but
his
heart
was
untouched
till
he
read
wordsworth
lyrical
ballads
and
this
recreated
a
living
god
for
him
melted
his
heart
to
tears
and
made
him
long
for
companionship
its
effect
was
instantly
seen
in
his
preaching
and
soon
made
him
slightly
suspected
as
heretical
john
addington
symonds
in
his
autobiography
describes
his
devotion
to
creed
in
the
green
infancy
of
ritualism
in
his
early
teens
at
he
and
his
mates
with
half
sincerity
followed
a
classmate
to
compline
donned
surplices
tossed
censers
arranged
altars
in
their
studies
bought
bits
of
painted
glass
for
their
windows
and
illuminated
crucifixes
with
gold
dust
and
vermilion
when
he
was
confirmed
this
was
somewhat
of
an
epoch
preparation
was
like
a
plowshare
although
it
turned
up
nothing
valuable
and
stimulated
esthetic
and
emotional
ardor
in
a
dim
way
he
felt
god
near
but
he
did
not
learn
to
fling
the
arms
of
the
soul
in
faith
around
the
cross
of
christ
later
the
revelation
he
found
in
plato
removed
him
farther
from
boyhood
he
fell
in
love
with

walter
pater
has
described
phases
of
ferment
perhaps
largely
his
own
in
the
character
of
florian
deleal
his
rapture
of
the
red
hawthorn
blossoms
absolutely
the
reddest
of
all
things
his
times
of
seemingly
exclusive
predominance
of
interest
in
beautiful
physical
things
a
kind
of
tyranny
of
the
senses
and
his
later
absorbing
efforts
to
estimate
the
proportion
of
the
sensuous
and
ideal
assigning
most
importance
to
sensible
vehicles
and
occasions
associating
all
thoughts
with
touch
and
sight
as
a
link
between
himself
and
things
till
he
became
more
and
more
unable
to
care
for
or
think
of
soul
but
as
in
an
actual
body
comforted
in
the
contemplation
of
death
by
the
thought
of
flesh
turning
to
violets
and
almost
oppressed
by
the
pressure
of
the
sensible
world
his
longings
for
beauty
intensifying
his
fear
of
death
he
loved
to
gaze
on
dead
faces
in
the
paris
morgue
although
the
haunt
of
them
made
the
sunshine
sickly
for
days
and
his
long
fancy
that
they
had
not
really
gone
nor
were
quite
motionless
but
led
a
secret
half
fugitive
life
freer
by
night
and
perhaps
dodging
about
in
their
old
haunts
with
no
great
toward
the
living
made
him
by
turns
pity
and
hate
the
ghosts
who
came
back
in
the
wind
beating
at
the
doors
his
religious
nature
gradually
yielded
to
a
mystical
belief
in
bible
personages
in
some
indefinite
place
as
the
reflexes
and
patterns
of
our
nobler
self
whose
companionship
made
the
world
more
satisfying
there
was
a
constant
substitution
of
the
typical
for
the
actual
and
angels
might
be
met
anywhere
a
deep
mysticity
brooded
over
real
things
and
partings
marriages
and
many
acts
and
accidents
of
life
the
very
colors
of
things
became
themselves
weighty
with
meanings
or
full
of
penitence
and
peace
for
a
time
he
walked
through
the
world
in
a
sustained
not
unpleasurable
awe
generated
by
the
habitual
recognition
beside
every
circumstance
and
event
of
life
of
its
celestial
correspondent
in
boulger
life
of
general
charles
gordon
he
records
how
like
nelson
clive
his
hero
was
prone
to
boys
escapades
and
outbreaks
that
often
made
him
the
terror
of
his
superiors
he
was
no
bookworm
but
famous
as
the
possessor
of
high
spirits
very
often
involved
in
affairs
that
necessitated
discipline
and
seemed
greatly
out
of
harmony
with
the
popular
idea
of
the
ascetic
of
mount
carmel
as
a
schoolboy
he
made
wonderful
squirts
that
would
wet
you
through
in
a
minute
one
sunday
panes
of
glass
in
a
large
storehouse
were
broken
with
screws
shot
through
them
by
his
for
ventilation
ringing
bells
and
pushing
young
boys
in
butting
an
unpopular
officer
severely
in
the
stomach
with
his
head
and
taking
the
punishment
hitting
a
bully
with
a
and
being
put
back
six
months
in
the
royal
military
academy
at
woolwich
these
are
the
early
outcrops
of
one
side
of
his
dual
character
although
more
soldier
than
saint
he
had
a
very
cheery
genial
side
he
was
always
ready
to
take
even
the
severest
punishment
for
all
his
scrapes
due
to
excessive
high
spirits
when
one
of
his
superiors
declared
that
he
would
never
make
an
officer
he
felt
his
honor
touched
and
his
vigorous
and
expressive
reply
was
to
tear
the
epaulets
from
his
shoulders
and
throw
them
at
his
superior
feet
he
had
already
developed
some
of
the
rather
moody
love
of
seclusion
that
was
marked
later
but
religion
did
not
strike
him
deeply
enough
to
bring
him
into
the
church
until
he
was
when
he
took
his
first
sacrament
on
one
occasion
he
declined
promotion
within
his
reach
because
he
would
have
had
to
pass
a
friend
to
get
it
he
acted
generally
on
his
impulses
which
were
perhaps
better
than
his
judgments
took
great
pleasure
in
corresponding
on
religious
topics
with
his
elder
sister
and
early
formed
the
habit
of
excessive
smoking
which
gravely
affected
his
health
later
his
was
the
rare
combination
of
inner
repose
and
confidence
interrupted
by
spells
of
gaiety
williamson
in
his
life
of
holman
hunt
tells
us
that
at
thirteen
he
was
removed
from
school
as
inapt
in
study
he
began
to
spend
his
time
in
drawing
in
his
copybooks
he
was
made
clerk
to
an
auctioneer
who
fortunately
encouraged
his
passion
and
at
sixteen
was
with
a
calico
printer
here
he
amused
himself
by
drawing
flies
on
the
window
which
his
employer
tried
to
brush
off
there
was
the
greatest
home
opposition
to
his
studying
art
after
being
rejected
twice
he
was
admitted
at
seventeen
to
the
academy
school
as
a
probationer
and
the
next
year
in
as
a
student
here
he
met
millais
and
rossetti
and
was
able
to
relieve
the
strain
on
his
mind
which
the
worry
of
his
father
concerning
his
course
caused
him
and
very
soon
his
career
began
at
thirteen
fitzjames
stephen
roused
himself
to
thrash
a
big
boy
who
had
long
bullied
him
and
became
a
fighter
in
his
sixteenth
year
he
grew
nearly
five
inches
but
was
so
shy
and
timid
at
eton
that
he
says
i
was
like
a
sensible
woman
among
a
crowd
of
rough
boys
but
in
the
reaction
to
the
long
abuse
his
mind
was
steeled
against
oppression
tyranny
and
every
kind
of
unfairness
he
read
paine

went
through

most
of
his
characters
however
are
so
overdrawn
and
caricatured
as
to
be
hardly
true
to
life
in
the
romance
of
john
inglesant
by
shorthouse
we
have
a
remarkable
picture
of
an
unusually
gifted
youth
who
played
an
important
rôle
in
the
days
of
cromwell
and
king
charles
and
who
was
long
poised
in
soul
between
the
church
of
rome
and
the
english
party
he
was
very
susceptible
to
the
fascination
of
superstition
romance
and
and
at
eleven
absorbed
his
master
rosicrucian
theories
of
spiritual
existence
where
spirits
held
converse
with
each
other
and
with
mankind
a
mystic
platonism
which
taught
that
story
of
the
argo
was
only
a
recipe
for
the
philosopher
stone
fascinated
him
at
fourteen
the
philosophy
of
obedience
and
of
the
subjection
of
reason
to
authority
was
early
taught
him
and
he
sought
to
live
from
within
hearing
only
the
divine
law
as
the
worshipers
of
cybele
heard
only
the
flutes
his
twin
brother
eustace
was
an
active
worldling
and
soon
he
followed
him
to
court
as
page
to
the
queen
but
delighted
more
and
more
in
wandering
apart
and
building
air
castles
for
a
time
he
was
entirely
swayed
and
his
life
directed
by
a
jesuit
father
who
taught
him
the
crucifix
and
the
rosary
at
sixteen
the
doctrine
of
divine
illumination
fascinated
him
he
struggled
to
find
the
path
of
true
devotion
abandoned
himself
to
extremely
ritualistic
forms
of
worship
dabbled
a
little
in
alchemy
and
astrology
to
help
develop
the
divine
nature
within
him
and
to
attain
the
beatific
vision
soon
he
was
introduced
to
the
protestant
nunnery
as
it
was
called
where
the
venerable
ferran
a
friend
of
george
herbert
was
greatly
taken
by
inglesant
accomplishments
and
grace
of
manner
various
forms
of
extremely
high
church
yet
protestant
worship
were
celebrated
here
each
day
with
great
devotion
until
he
became
disgusted
with
puritanism
and
craved
to
participate
in
the
office
of
mass
at
this
point
however
he
met
hobbes
whose
rude
but
forcible
condemnation
of
papacy
restrained
him
from
casting
his
lot
with
it
at
seventeen
he
saw
one
night
a
real
apparition
of
the
just
executed
strafford
the
last
act
of
his
youth
which
we
can
note
here
was
soon
after
he
was
twenty
when
he
fell
in
love
with
the
charming
and
saintly
mary
collet
the
rough
puritan
thorne
had
made
her
proposals
at
which
she
revolted
but
she
and
inglesant
confessed
love
to
each
other
she
saw
however
that
they
had
a
way
of
life
marked
out
for
themselves
by
an
inner
impulse
and
light
this
calling
they
must
follow
and
abandon
love
and
now
john
plunged
into
the
war
on
the
side
of
the
king
stillman
has
written
with
unusual
interest
and
candor
the
story
of
his
own
early
life
as
a
boy
he
was
frenzied
at
the
first
sight
of
the
sea
caught
the
whip
and
lashed
the
horses
in
an
unconscious
delirium
and
always
remembered
this
as
one
of
the
most
vivid
experiences
of
his
life
he
had
a
period
of
nature
worship
his
first
trout
was
a
delirium
and
he
danced
about
wildly
and
furiously
he
relates
his
very
vivid
impressions
of
the
religious
orthodoxy
in
which
he
was
reared
especially
revival
sermons
his
occasional
falsehoods
to
escape
severe
punishment
his
baptism
at
ten
or
eleven
in
a
river
in
midwinter
the
somberness
of
his
intellectual
life
which
was
long
very
apathetic
his
phenomenal
stupidity
for
years
his
sudden
insurrections
in
which
he
thrashed
bullies
at
school
his
fear
that
he
should
be
sent
home
in
disgrace
for
bad
scholarship
and
how
at
last
after
seven
years
of
dulness
at
the
age
of
fourteen
the
mental
fog
broke
away
suddenly
and
before
the
term
ended
i
could
construe
the
latin
in
less
time
than
it
took
to
recite
it
and
the
demonstrations
of
euclid
were
as
plain
and
clear
as
a
fairy
story
my
memory
came
back
so
distinctly
that
i
could
recite
long
poems
after
a
single
reading
and
no
member

a

brilliant
examination

the

the

examination
was

as
the
most
remarkable
which
the
academy
had
witnessed
for
many
years
i
have
never
been
able
to
conceive
an
explanation
of
this
curious
phenomenon
which
i
record
only
as
of
possible
interest
to
some
one

a
varying
and
often
very
hard
experience

years

his
early
life
was
spent
on
a
farm
and
in
attending
a
country
academy
he
became
profoundly
interested
in
religion
in
the
early
teens

developed
extreme
interest
in

a
american
who
wishes
his
name
withheld
writes
me
of
his
youth
as
follows
first
came
the
love
of
emotion
and
lurid
romance
reading
my
mind
was
full
of
adventure
dreams
of
underground
passages
and
imprisoned
beauties
whom
i
rescued
i
wrote
a
story
in
red
ink
which
i
never
read
but
a
girl
friend
did
and
called
it
magnificent
the
girl
fever
too
made
me
idealize
first
one
five
years
older
than
i
later
another
three
years
older
and
still
later
one
of
my
own
age
i
would
have
eaten
dirt
for
each
of
them
for
a
year
or
two
was
extremely
gallant
and
the
hero
of
many
romances
for
two
but
all
the
time
so
bashful
that
i
scarcely
dared
speak
to
one
of
them
and
no
schoolmate
ever
suspected
it
all
music
also
became
a
craze
at
fourteen
before
i
had
hated
lessons
now
i
was
thrilled
and
would
be
a
musician
despite
my
parents
protests
i
practised
the
piano
furiously
wrote
music
and
copied
stacks
of
it
made
a
list
of
several
hundred
pieces
and
tunes
including
everything
musical
i
knew
would
imagine
a
crowded
hall
where
i
played
and
swayed
with
fine
airs
the
vast
assembly
applauded
and
would
not
let
me
go
but
all
the
time
it
was
a
simple
piece
and
i
was
a
very
ordinary
player
at
fifty
years
this
is
still
a
relic
i
now
in
hours
of
fatigue
pound
the
piano
and
dreamily
imagine
dazed
and
enchanted
audiences
then
came
oratory
and
i
glowed
and
thrilled
in
declaiming
webster
reply
to
hayne
thanatopsis
byron
darkness
patrick
henry
and
best
of
all
the
maniac
which
i
spouted
in
a
fervid
way
wearing
a
flaming
red
necktie
i
remember
a
fervid
scene
with
myself
on
a
high
solitary
hill
with
a
bald
summit
two
miles
from
home
where
i
once
went
because
i
had
been
blamed
i
tried
to
sum
myself
up
inventory
my
good
and
bad
points
it
was
sunday
and
i
was
keyed
up
to
a
frenzy
of
resolve
prayer
idealization
of
life
all
grew
all
in
a
jumble
my
resolve
to
go
to
college
was
clinched
then
and
there
and
that
hill
will
always
remain
my
pisgah
and
moriah
horeb
and
sinai
all
in
one
i
paced
back
and
forth
in
the
wind
and
shouted
will
make
people
know
and
revere
me
i
will
do
something
and
called
everything
to
witness
my
vow
that
i
never
again
would
visit
this
spot
till
all
was
fulfilled
alas
he
says
i
have
never
been
there
since
once
to
a
summer
party
who
went
i
made
excuse
for
not
keeping
this
rendezvous
it
was
too
sacramental
certainly
it
was
a
very
deep
and
experience
there
all
alone
when
something
of
great
moment
to
me
certainly
took
place
in
my
soul
in
the
biography
of
frederick
douglas
we
are
told
that
when
he
was
about
thirteen
he
began
to
feel
deeply
the
moral
yoke
of
slavery
and
to
seek
means
of
escaping
it
he
became
interested
in
religion
was
converted
and
dreamed
of
and
prayed
for
liberty
with
great
ingenuity
he
extracted
knowledge
of
the
alphabet
and
reading
from
white
boys
of
his
acquaintance
at
sixteen
under
a
brutal
master
he
revolted
and
was
beaten
until
he
was
faint
from
loss
of
blood
and
at
seventeen
he
fought
and
whipped
the
brutal
overseer
covey
who
would
have
invoked
the
law
which
made
death
the
punishment
for
such
an
offense
but
for
shame
of
having
been
worsted
by
a
negro
boy
and
from
the
reflection
that
there
was
no
profit
from
a
dead
slave
only
at
twenty
did
he
escape
into
the
new
world
of
freedom
jacob
riis
fell
head
over
heels
in
love
with
sweet
elizabeth
when
he
was
fifteen
and
she
thirteen
his
courtship
proceeded
at
a
tumultuous
pace
which
first
made
the
town
laugh
then
put
it
out
of
patience
and
made
some
staid
matrons
express
the
desire
to
box
my
ears
soundly
she
played
among
the
lumber
where
he
worked
and
he
watched
her
so
intently
that
he
scarred
his
shinbone
with
an
adze
he
should
have
been
minding
he
cut
off
his
forefinger
with
an
ax
when
she
was
dancing
on
a
beam
near
by
and
once
fell
off
a
roof
when
craning
his
neck
to
see
her
go
round
a
corner
at
another
time
he
ordered
her
father
off
the
because
he
tried
to
take
his
daughter
home
a
few
minutes
before
the
appointed
hour
of
midnight
young
as
he
was
he
was
large
and
tried
to
run
away
to
join
the
army
but
finally
went
to
copenhagen
to
serve
his
apprenticeship
with
a
builder
and
here
had
an
interview
with
hans
christian
andersen
ellery
sedgwick
tells
as
that
at
thirteen
the
mind
of
thomas
paine
ran
on
stories
of
the
sea
which
his
teacher
had
told
him
and
that
he
attempted
to
enlist
on
the
privateer
he
was
restless
at
home
for
years
and
shipped
on
a
trading
vessel
at
nineteen
indeed
modern
literature
in
our
tongue
abounds
in
this
element
from
childe
harold
to
the
second
and
third
long
chapters
in
david
grieve
ending
with
his
engagement
to
lucy
purcell
thackeray
arthur
pendennis
and
his
characteristic
love
of
the
far
older

who
read
darwin
was
expelled
from
the

college
and
the
church
and
finally
was
engaged
to
gabriella
and
scores
more
might
be
enumerated
there
is
even
sonny
who
rude
as
he
was
and
poorly
as
he
did
in
all
his
studies
at
the
same
age
when
he
began
to
keep
company
tallered
his
hair
tied
a
bow
of
ribbon
to
the
buggy
whip
and
grew
interested
in
manners
passing
things
putting
on
his
coat
and
taking
off
his
hat
at
table
began
to
study
his
menagerie

snakes
toads
lizards
wrote
john
burroughs
helped
him
and
got
help
in
return
took
to
observing
and
finally
wrote
a
book
about
the
forest
and
its
occupants
all
of
which
is
very
if
not
historic
truth
two
singular
reflections
always
rearise
in
reading
autobiographical
writings
first
that
both
the
age
and
the
place
with
its
ceremonies
festivals
great
pomp
and
stirring
events
in
close
quarters
in
the
little
province
where
he
lived
were
especially
adapted
to
educate
children
and
absorb
them
in
externals
and
second
that
this
wonderful
boy
had
an
extreme
propensity
for
moralizing
and
drawing
lessons
of
practical
service
from
all
about
him
this
is
no
less
manifest
in
wilhelm
meister
apprenticeship
and
travels
which
supplements
the
autobiography
both
together
present
a
very
unique
type
of
adolescence
the
elaborate
story
of
which
defies
epitome
from
the
puppet
craze
well
on
into
his
precocious
university
life
it
was
his
passion
to
explore
the
widest
ranges
of
experience
and
then
to
reflect
moralize
or
poetize
upon
them
perhaps
no
one
ever
studied
the
nascent
stages
of
his
own
life
and
elaborated
their
every
incident
with
such
careful
observation
and
analysis
his
peculiar
diathesis
enabled
him
to
conserve
their
freshness
on
to
full
maturity
when
he
gave
them
literary
form
most
lack
power
to
fully
utilize
their
own
experience
even
for
practical
and
guidance
but
with
goethe
nothing
was
wasted
from
which
could
be
extracted
goethe
first
impression
of
female
loveliness
was
of
a
girl
named
gretchen
who
served
wine
one
evening
and
whose
face
and
form
followed
him
for
a
long
time
their
meetings
always
gave
him
a
thrill
of
pleasure
and
though
his
love
was
like
many
first
loves
very
spiritual
and
awakened
by
goodness
and
beauty
it
gave
a
new
brightness
to
the
whole
world
and
to
be
near
her
seemed
to
him
an
indispensable
condition
of
his
being
her
was
generally
with
her
and
goethe
experienced
a
shock
in
finding
that
she
had
become
a
milliner
assistant
for
although
like
all
natural
boys
of
aristocratic
families
he
loved
common
people
this
interest
was
not
favored
by
his
parents
the
night
following
the
coronation
day
several
were
compelled
to
spend
in
chairs
and
he
and
his
gretchen
with
others
slept
she
with
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
until
all
the
others
had
awakened
in
the
morning
at
last
they
parted
at
her
door
and
for
the
first
and
last
time
they
kissed
but
never
met
again
although
he
often
wept
in
thinking
of
her
he
was
terribly
affronted
to
fully
realize
that
although
only
two
years
older
than
himself
she
should
have
regarded
him
as
a
child
he
tried
to
strip
her
of
all
loving
qualities
and
think
her
odious
but
her
image
hovered
over
him
the
sanity
of
instinct
innate
in
youth
prompted
him
to
lay
aside
as
childish
the
foolish
habit
of
weeping
and
railing
and
his
mortification
that
she
regarded
him
somewhat
as
a
nurse
might
gradually
helped
to
work
his
cure
he
was
very
fond
of
his
own
name
and
like
young
and
uneducated
people
wrote
or
carved
it
anywhere
later
placed
near
it
that
of
a
new
love
annette
and
afterward
on
finding
the
tree
he
shed
tears
melted
toward
her
and
made
an
idyl
he
was
also
seized
with
a
passion
of
teasing
her
and
dominating
over
her
devotedness
with
wanton
and
tyrannical
caprice
venting
upon
her
the
ill
humor
of
his
disappointments
and
grew
absurdly
jealous
and
lost
her
after
she
had
borne
with
him
with
incredible
patience
and
after
terrible
scenes
with
her
by
which
he
gained
nothing
frenzied
by
his
loss
he
began
to
abuse
his
physical
nature
and
was
only
saved
from
illness
by
the
healing
power
of
his
poetic
talent
the
lover
caprice
was
written
with
the
impetus
of
a
boiling
passion
in
the
midst
of
many
serious
events
a
reckless
humor
which
was
due
to
the
excess
of
life
developed
which
made
him
feel
himself
superior
to
the
moment
and
even
to
court
danger
he
played
tricks
although
rarely
with
premeditation
later
he
mused
much
upon
the
transient
nature
of
love
and
the
mutability
of
character
the
extent
to
which
the
senses
could
be
indulged
within
the
bounds
of
morality
he
sought
to
rid
himself
of
all
that
troubled
him
by
writing
song
or
epigram
about
it
which
made
him
seem
frivolous
and
prompted
one
friend
to
seek
to
subdue
him
by
means
of
church
forms
which
he
had
severed
on
coming
to
leipzig
by
degrees
he
felt
an
epoch
approaching
when
all
respect
for
authority
was
to
vanish
and
he
became
suspicious
and
even
despairing
with
regard
to
the
best
individuals
he
had
known
before
and
grew
chummy
with
a
young
tutor
whose
jokes
and
fooleries
were
incessant
his
disposition
fluctuated
between
gaiety
and
melancholy
and
rousseau
attracted
him
meanwhile
his
health
declined
until
a
long
illness
which
began
with
a
hemorrhage
caused
him
to
oscillate
for
days
between
life
and
death
and
convalescence
generally
so
delightful
was
marred
by
a
serious
tumor
his
father
disposition
was
stern
and
he
could
become
passionate
and
bitter
and
his
mother
domesticity
made
her
turn
to
religion
so
that
on
coming
home
he
formed
the
acquaintance
of
a
religious
circle
again
goethe
was
told
by
a
hostile
child
that
he
was
not
the
true
son
of
his
father
this
inoculated
him
with
a
disease
that
long
lurked
in
his
system
and
prompted
various
indirect
investigations
to
get
at
the
truth
during
which
he
compared
all
distinguished
guests
with
his
own
physiognomy
to
detect
his
own
likeness
up
to
the
leipzig
period
he
had
great
joy
in
wandering
unknown
unconscious
of
self
but
he
soon
began
to
torment
himself
with
an
almost
hypertrophied
fancy
that
he
was
attracting
much
attention
that
others
eyes
were
turned
on
his
person
to
fix
it
in
their
memories
that
he
was
scanned
and
found
fault
with
and
hence
he
developed
a
love
of
the
country
of
the
woods
and
solitary
places
where
he
could
be
hedged
in
and
separated
from
all
the
world
here
he
began
to
throw
off
his
former
habit
of
looking
at
things
from
the
art
standpoint
and
to
take
pleasure
in
natural
objects
for
their
own
sake
his
mother
had
almost
grownup
to
consciousness
in
her
two
oldest
children
and
his
first
disappointment
in
love
turned
his
thought
all
the
more
affectionately
toward
her
and
his
sister
a
year
younger
he
was
long
consumed
with
amazement
over
the
newly
awakening
sense
impulse
that
took
intellectual
forms
and
the
mental
needs
that
clothed
themselves
in
sense
images
he
fell
to
building
air
castles
of
opposition
lecture
courses
and
gave
himself
up
to
many
dreams
of
ideal
university
conditions
he
first
attended
lectures
diligently
but
suffered
much
harm
from
being
too
advanced
learned
a
great
deal
that
he
could
not
regulate
and
was
thereby
made
uncomfortable
grew
interested
in
the
fit
of
his
clothes
of
which
hitherto
he
had
been
careless
he
was
in
despair
at
the
uncertainty
of
his
own
taste
and
judgment
and
almost
feared
he
must
make
a
complete
change
of
mind
renouncing
what
he
had
hitherto
learned
and
so
one
day
in
great
contempt
for
his
past
burned
up
his
poetry
sketches
etc
he
had
learned
to
value
and
love
the
bible
and
owed
his
moral
culture
to
it
its
events
and
symbols
were
deeply
stamped
upon
him
so
without
being
a
pietist
he
was
greatly
moved
at
the
scoffing
spirit
toward
it
which
he
met
at
the
university
from
youth
he
had
stood
on
good
terms
with
god
and
at
times
he
had
felt
that
he
had
some
things
to
forgive
god
for
not
having
given
better
assistance
to
his
infinite
under
all
this
influence
he
turned
to
cabalism
and
became
interested
in
crystals
and
the
microcosm
and
macrocosm
and
fell
into
the
habit
of
despair
over
what
he
had
been
and
believed
just
before
he
conceived
a
kind
of
hermetical
or
neoplatonic
godhead
creating
in
more
and
more
eccentric
circles
until
the
last
which
rose
in
contradiction
was
lucifer
to
whom
creation
was
committed
he
first
of
all
imagined
in
detail
an
angelic
host
and
finally
a
whole
theology
was
wrought
out
he
used
a
gilt
ornamented
as
a
kind
of
altar
with
fumigating
pastils
for
incense
where
each
morning
god
was
approached
by
offerings
until
one
day
a
conflagration
put
a
sudden
end
to
these
celebrations

remembered
as
a
boy
of
eleven
the
revolution
of
in
berlin
soon
after
which
he
was
placed
in
froebel
school
at
keilhau
this
great
teacher
with
his
noble
associates
middendorf
barop
and
langekhal
lived
with
the
boys
told
the
stirring
stories
of
their
own
lives
as
soldiers
in
the
war
of
liberation
led
their
pupils
on
long
excursions
in
vacation
often
lasting
for
months
and
gave
much
liberty
to
the
boys
who
were
allowed
to
haze
not
only
their
new
mates
but
new
teachers
this
transfer
from
the
city
to
the
country
roused
a
veritable
passion
in
the
boy
who
remained
here
till
he
was
fifteen
trees
and
cliffs
were
climbed
collections
made
the
saale
by
moonlight
and
the
lofty
steiger
at
sunset
were
explored
there
were
swimming
and
skating
and
games
and
the
maxim
of
the
school
freude
peace
joy
freedom
was
lived
up
to
the
boys
hung
on
their
teachers
for
stories
the
teachers
took
their
boys
into
their
confidence
for
all
their
own
literary
aims
loves
and
ideals
one
had
seen
the
corpse
of
körner
and
another
knew
prohaska
the
roman
postulate
that
knowledge
should
be
imparted
to
boys
according
to
a
thoroughly
tested
method
approved
by
the
mature
human
intellect
and
which
seems
most
useful
to
it
for
later
life
was
the
old
system
of
sacrificing
the
interests
of
the
child
for
those
of
the
man
here
childhood
was
to
live
itself
out
completely
and
naturally
into
an
ever
renewed
paradise
the
temperaments
dispositions
and
characters
of
each
of
the
sixty
boys
were
carefully
studied
and
recorded
some
of
these
are
still
little
masterpieces
of
psychological
penetration
and
this
was
made
the
basis
of
development
the
extreme
teutonism
cultivated
by
wrestling
shooting
and
fencing
giving
each
a
spot
of
land
to
sow
reap
and
shovel
and
all
in
an
atmosphere
of
adult
life
made
an
environment
that
fitted
the
transition
period
as
well
as
any
that
the
history
of
education
affords
every
tramp
and
battle
were
described
in
a
book
by
each
boy
when
at
fifteen
ebers
was
transferred
to
the
kottbus
gymnasium
he
felt
like
a
colt
led
from
green
pastures
to
the
stable
and
the
period
of
effervescence
made
him
almost
possessed
by
a
demon
so
many
sorts
of
follies
did
he
commit
he
wrote
a
poem
of
the
world
fell
in
love
with
an
actress
older
than
himself

known
as
foolhardy

wild
escapades

the
author
whom
meyer
calls
the
most
eminent
literary
german
of
the
nineteenth
century
reviews
the
memories
of
his
early
life
this
autobiography
is
a
plain
and
very
realistic
story
of
a
normal
child
and
not
adulterated
with
fiction
like
goethe
or
with
psychoses
like
rousseau
or
bashkirtseff
he
seems
a
boy
like
all
other
boys
and
his
childhood
and
youth
were
in
no
wise
extraordinary
the
first
part
of
this
work
which
describes
his
youth
up
to
the
age
of
eighteen
is
the
most
important
and
everything
is
given
with
remarkable
fidelity
and
minuteness
it
is
a
tale
of
little
things
all
the
friendships
and
loves
and
impulses
are
there
and
he
is
fundamentally
selfish
and
utilitarian
god
and
nature
were
one
and
only
when
his
beloved
army
died
did
he
wish
to
believe
in
immortality
he
too
as
a
child
found
two
kinds
of
love
in
his
heart
the
idea
and
the
sensual
very
independent
the
one
for
a
young
and
innocent
girl
and
the
other
for
a
superb
young
woman
years
older
than
he
pure
although
the
personification
of
sense
he
gives
a
rich
harvest
of
minute
and
sagacious
observations
about
his
strange
simultaneous
loves
the
peculiar
tastes
of
food
his
period
and
his
rather
prolonged
habit
of
lying
the
latter
because
he
had
no
other
vent
for
invention
he
describes
with
great
regret
his
leaving
school
at
so
early
an
age
his
volcanic
passion
of
anger
his
his
periods
of
abandon
his
passion
to
make
a
success
of
art
though
he
did
not
of
life
his
spells
of
and
cynicism
his
periods
of
desolation
in
his
single
life
his
habit
of
his
wrestling
with
the
problem
of
theology
and
god
the
conflict
between
his
philosophy
and
his
love
of
the
girls
etc
from
a
private
school
in
leipzig
where
he
had
shown
all
a
boy
tact
in
finding
what
his
masters
thought
the
value
of
each
subject
they
taught
where
he
had
joined
in
the
vandalism
of
using
a
to
break
a
way
to
the
hated
science
apparatus
and
to
destroy
it
feeling
that
the
classical
writers
were
overpraised
and
where
at
the
age
of
sixteen
he
had
appeared
several
times
in
public
as
a
reciter
of
his
own
poems
max
müller
returned
to
leipzig
and
entered
upon
the
freedom
of
university
life
there
at
the
age
of
seventeen
for
years
his
chief
enjoyment
was
music
he
played
the
piano
well
heard
everything
he
could
in
concert
or
opera
was
an
oratorio
tenor
and
grew
more
and
more
absorbed
in
music
so
that
he
planned
to
devote
himself
altogether
to
it
and
also
to
enter
a
musical
school
at
dessau
but
nothing
came
of
it
at
the
university
he
saw
little
of
society
was
once
incarcerated
for
wearing
a
club
ribbon
and
confesses
that
with
his
boon
companions
he
was
guilty
of
practises
which
would
now
bring
culprits
into
collision
with
authorities
he
fought
three
duels
participated
in
many
pranks
and
freakish
escapades
but
nevertheless
attended
different
courses
of
lectures
in
three
years
when
hegelism
was
the
state
philosophy
he
tried
hard
to
understand
it
but
dismissed
it
with
the
sentiments
expressed
by
a
french
officer
to
his
tailor
who
refused
to
take
the
trousers
he
had
ordered
to
be
made
very
tight
because
they
did
not
fit
so
closely
that
he
could
not
get
into
them
darwin
attracted
him
yet
the
wildness
of
his
followers
repelled
he
says
i
confess
i
felt
quite
bewildered
for
a
time
and
began
to
despair
altogether
of
my
reasoning
powers
he
wonders
how
young
minds
in
german
universities
survive
the
storms
and
fogs
through
which
they
pass
with
bated
breath
he
heard
his
elders
talk
of
philosophy
and
tried
to
lay
hold
of
a
word
here
and
there
but
it
all
floated
before
his
mind
like
mist
later
he
had
an
hegelian
period
but
found
in
herbart
a
corrective
and
at
last
decided
upon
sanskrit
and
other
ancient
languages
because
he
felt
that
he
must
know
something
that
no
other
knew
and
also
that
the
germans
had
then
heard
only
the
and
not
the
real
striking
of
the
bells
of
indian
philosophy
from
twenty
his
struggles
and
his
queries
grew
more
definite
and
at
last
at
the
age
of
he
was
fully
launched
upon
his
career
in
paris
and
later
went
to
oxford
at
thirteen
wagner
translated
about
half
the
odyssey
voluntarily
at
fourteen
began
the
tragedy
which
was
to
combine
the
grandeur
of
two
of
shakespeare
dramas
at
sixteen
he
tried
his
musical
wings
by
soaring
at
once
to
the
highest
peaks
of
orchestral
achievement
without
wasting
any
time
on
the
humble
he
sought
to
make
a
new
departure
and
compared
to
the
grandeur
of
his
own
composition
beethoven
ninth
symphony
appeared
like
a
simple
pleyel
sonata
to
facilitate
the
reading
of
his
astounding
score
he
wrote
it
in
three
kinds
of
ink
red
for
strings
green
for
the
and
black
for
the
brass
instruments
he
writes
that
this
overture
was
the
climax
of
his
absurdities
and
although
the
audience
before
which
an
accommodating
orchestra
played
it
were
disgusted
and
the
musicians
were
convulsed
with
laughter
it
made
a
deep
impression
upon
the
author
mind
even
after
matriculating
at
the
university
he
abandoned
himself
so
long
to
the
dissipations
common
to
student
life
before
the
reaction
came
that
his
relatives
feared
that
he
was
a
in
his
hannele
hauptmann
the
dramatist
describes
in
a
kind
of
dream
poem
what
he
supposed
to
pass
through
the
mind
of
a
dying
girl
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
who
does
not
wish
to
live
and
is
so
absorbed
by
the
brownies
of
her
brain
that
she
hardly
knows
whether
she
is
alive
on
earth
or
dead
in
heaven
and
who
sees
the
lord
jesus
in
the
form
of
the
schoolmaster
whom
she
adores
in
her
closing
vision
there
is
a
symbolic
representation
of
her
own
resurrection
to
the
passionate
discussions
in
germany
england
and
france
as
to
whether
this
character
is
true
to
adolescence
we
can
only
answer
with
an
emphatic
affirmative
that
her
heaven
abounds
in
local
color
and
in
fairy
tale
items
that
it
is
very
material
and
that
she
is
troubled
by
fears
of
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
is
answer
enough
in
an
starving
child
with
a
fevered
brain
whose
dead
mother
taught
her
these
things
paul
and
virginia
is
an
attempt
to
describe
budding
adolescence
in
a
boy
and
girl
born
on
a
remote
island
and
reared
in
a
state
of
natural
simplicity
the
descriptions
are
sentimental
after
the
fashion
of
the
age
in
france
and
the
pathos
which
to
us
smacks
of
affectation
and
artificiality
nevertheless
has
a
vein
of
truth
in
it
the
story
really
begins
when
the
two
children
were
twelve
and
the
description
of
the
dawn
of
love
and
melancholy
in
virginia
heart
for
some
time
concealed
from
paul
of
her
disquiet
and
piety
of
the
final
frank
avowal
of
eternal
love
by
each
set
of
by
the
pathetic
separation
and
of
the
undying
love
and
finally
the
tragic
death
and
burial
of
each
all
this
owes
its
charm
for
its
many
generations
of
readers
to
its
merits
as
an
essentially
true
picture
of
the
human
heart
at
this
critical
age
this
work
and
rousseau
have
contributed
to
give
french
literature
its
peculiar
cast
in
its
description
of
this
age
the
first
explosions
of
combustible
constitution
in
rousseau
precocious
nature
were
troublesome
and
he
felt
premature
sensations
of
erotic
voluptuousness
but
without
any
sin
he
longed
to
fall
at
the
feet
of
an
imperious
mistress
obey
her
mandates
or
implore
pardon
he
only
wanted
a
lady
to
become
a
knight
errant
at
ten
he
was
passionately
devoted
to
a
mlle
vulson
whom
he
publicly
and
tyrannically
claimed
as
his
own
and
would
allow
no
other
to
approach
he
had
very
different
sensuous
feelings
toward
mlle
goton
with
whom
his
relations
were
very
passionate
though
pure
absolutely
under
the
power
of
both
these
mistresses
the
effects
they
produced
upon
him
were
in
no
wise
related
to
each
other
the
former
was
a
affection
with
the
jealousy
of
a
lover
added
but
the
latter
a
furious
tigerish
turkish
rage
when
told
of
the
former
marriage
in
his
indignation
and
heroic
fury
he
swore
never
more
to
see
a
perfidious
girl
a
slightly
neurotic
vein
of
prolonged
ephebeitis
pervades
much
of
his
life
pierre
loti
story
of
a
child
was
written
when
the
author
was
and
contains
hardly
a
fact
but
it
is
one
of
the
best
of
inner
autobiographies
and
is
nowhere
richer
than
in
the
last
chapters
which
bring
the
author
down
to
the
age
of
fourteen
and
a
half
he
vividly
describes
the
new
joy
at
waking
which
he
began
to
feel
at
twelve
or
thirteen
the
clear
vision
into
the
bottomless
pit
of
death
the
new
marvelous
susceptibility
to
nature
as
comradeship
with
boys
of
his
own
age
was
lacking
the
sudden
desires
from
pure
bravado
and
perversity
to
do
something
unseemly
making
a
fly
omelet
and
carrying
it
in
a
procession
with
song
the
melting
of
pewter
plates
and
pouring
them
into
water
and
salting
a
wild
tract
of
land
with
them
organizing
a
band
of
miners
whom
he
led
as
if
with
keen
scent
to
the
right
spot
and
rediscovered
his
nuggets
everything
being
done
mysteriously
and
as
a
tribal
secret
loti
had
a
new
feeling
for
the
haunting
music
of
chopin
which
he
had
been
taught
to
play
but
had
not
been
interested
in
his
mind
was
inflamed
by
a
home
visit
of
an
elder
brother
with
the
idea
of
going
to
the
south
sea
islands
and
this
became
a
long
obsession
which
finally
led
him
to
enlist
in
the
navy
dropping
with
a
beating
heart
the
momentous
letter
into
the
after
long
misgivings
and
delays
he
had
a
superficial
and
a
hidden
self
the
latter
somewhat
whimsical
and
perhaps
ridiculous
shared
only
with
a
few
intimate
friends
for
whom
he
would
have
let
himself
be
cut
into
bits
he
believes
his
transition
period
lasted
longer
than
with
the
majority
of
men
and
during
it
he
was
carried
from
one
extreme
to
another
had
rather
eccentric
and
absurd
manners
and
touched
moat
of
the
perilous
rocks
on
the
voyage
of
life
he
had
an
early
love
for
an
older
girl
whose
name
he
wrote
in
cipher
on
his
books
although
he
felt
it
a
little
artificial
but
believed
it
might
have
developed
into
a
great
and
true
hereditary
friendship
continuing
that
which
their
ancestors
had
felt
for
many
generations
the
birth
of
love
in
his
heart
was
in
a
dream
after
having
read
the
forbidden
poet
alfred
de
musset
he
was
fourteen
and
in
his
dream
it
was
a
soft
odorous
twilight
he
walked
amid
flowers
seeking
a
nameless
some
one
whom
he
ardently
desired
and
felt
that
something
strange
and
wonderful
intoxicating
as
it
advanced
was
going
to
happen
the
twilight
grew
deeper
and
behind
a
he
saw
a
young
girl
with
a
languorous
and
mysterious
smile
although
her
forehead
and
eyes
were
hidden
as
it
darkened
rather
suddenly
her
eyes
came
out
and
they
were
very
personal
and
seemed
to
belong
to
some
one
already
much
beloved
who
had
been
found
with
transports
of
infinite
joy
and
tenderness
he
woke
with
a
start
and
sought
to
retain
the
phantom
which
faded
he
could
not
conceive
that
was
a
mere
illusion
and
as
he
realized
that
she
had
vanished
he
felt
overwhelmed
with
hopelessness
it
was
the
first
stirring
of
true
love
with
all
its
great
melancholy
and
deep
mystery
with
its
overwhelming
but
sad
enchantment
love
which
like
a
perfume
endows
with
a
fragrance
all
it
touches
it
is
i
believe
high
time
that
ephebic
literature
should
be
recognized
as
a
class
by
itself
and
have
a
place
of
its
own
in
the
history
of
letters
and
in
criticism
much
of
it
should
be
individually
prescribed
for
the
reading
of
the
young
for
whom
it
has
a
singular
zest
and
is
a
true
stimulus
and
corrective
this
stage
of
life
now
has
what
might
almost
be
called
a
school
of
its
own
here
the
young
appeal
to
and
listen
to
each
other
as
they
do
not
to
adults
and
in
a
way
the
latter
have
failed
to
appreciate
again
no
biography
and
especially
no
autobiography
should
henceforth
be
complete
if
it
does
not
describe
this
period
of
transformation
so
for
future
life
to
which
it
alone
can
often
give
the
key
rightly
to
draw
the
lessons

able
to
trace
the
normal
psychic
outgrowing
of
the
home
of
childhood
as
its
interests
irradiate
into
an
ever
enlarging
environment
almost
the
only
duty
of
small
children
is
habitual
and
prompt
obedience
our
very
presence
enforces
one
general
law
that
of
keeping
our
and
avoiding
our
displeasure
they
respect
all
we
smile
at
or
even
notice
and
grow
to
it
like
the
plant
toward
the
light
their
early
lies
are
often
saying
what
they
think
will
please
at
bottom
the
most
restless
child
admires
and
loves
those
who
save
him
from
too
great
fluctuations
by
coercion
provided
the
means
be
rightly
chosen
and
the
ascendency
extend
over
heart
and
mind
but
the
time
comes
when
parents
are
often
shocked
at
the
lack
of
respect
suddenly
shown
by
the
child
they
have
ceased
to
be
the
highest
ideals
the
period
of
habituating
morality
and
making
it
habitual
is
ceasing
and
the
passion
to
realize
freedom
to
act
on
personal
experience
and
to
keep
a
private
conscience
is
in
order
to
act
occasionally
with
independence
from
the
highest
possible
ideal
motives
develops
the
impulse
and
the
joy
of
pure
obligation
and
thus
brings
some
new
and
original
force
into
the
world
and
makes
habitual
guidance
by
the
highest
and
best
or
by
inner
as
opposed
to
outer
constraint
the
practical
rule
of
life
to
bring
the
richest
streams
of
thought
to
bear
in
interpreting
the
ethical
instincts
so
that
the
youth
shall
cease
to
live
in
a
moral
interregnum
is
the
real
goal
of
this
is
true
education
of
the
will
and
prepares
the
way
for
love
of
overcoming
obstacles
of
difficulty
perhaps
even
of
conflict
this
impulse
is
often
the
secret
of
obstinacy
and
yet
at
no
time
in
life
will
a
human
being
respond
so
heartily
if
treated
by
older
and
wiser
people
as
if
he
were
an
equal
or
even
a
superior
the
attempt
to
treat
a
child
at
adolescence
as
you
would
treat
an
inferior
is
instantly
fatal
to
good
discipline
parents
still
think
of
their
offspring
as
mere
children
and
tighten
the
rein
when
they
should
loosen
it
many
young
people
feel
that
they
have
the
best
of
homes
and
yet
that
they
will
go
crazy
if
they
must
remain
in
them
if
the
training
of
earlier
years
has
been
good
guidance
by
command
may
now
safely
give
way
to
that
by
ideals
which
are
sure
to
be
heroic
the
one
unpardonable
thing
for
the
adolescent
is
dullness
stupidity
lack
of
life
interest
and
enthusiasm
in
school
or
teachers
and
perhaps
above
all
too
great
stringency
least
of
all
at
this
stage
can
the
curriculum
school
be
an
ossuary
the
child
must
now
be
taken
into
the
family
councils
and
find
the
parents
interested
in
all
that
interests
him
where
this
is
not
done
we
have
the
conditions
for
the
interesting
cases
of
so
many
youth
who
now
begin
to
suspect
that
father
mother
or
both
are
not
their
true
parents
not
only
is
there
interest
in
rapidly
widening
associations
with
coevals
but
a
new
lust
to
push
on
and
up
to
maturity
one
marked
trait
now
is
to
seek
friends
and
companions
older
than
themselves
or
next
to
this
to
seek
those
younger
this
is
marked
contrast
with
previous
years
when
they
seek
associates
of
their
own
age
possibly
the
merciless
teasing
instinct
which
culminates
at
about
the
same
time
may
have
some
influence
but
certain
it
is
that
now
interest
is
transpolarized
up
and
down
the
age
scale
one
reason
is
the
new
hunger
for
information
not
only
concerning
reproduction
but
a
vast
variety
of
other
matters
so
that
there
is
often
an
attitude
of
silent
begging
for
knowledge
in
answer
to
lancaster
questions
on
this
subject
some
sought
older
associates
because
they
could
learn
more
from
them
found
them
better
or
more
steadfast
friends
craved
sympathy
and
found
most
of
it
from
older
and
perhaps
married
people
some
were
more
interested
in
their
parents
conversation
with
other
adults
than
with
themselves
and
were
particularly
entertained
by
the
chance
of
hearing
things
they
had
no
business
to
there
is
often
a
feeling
that
adults
do
not
realize
this
new
need
of
friendship
with
them
and
show
want
of
sympathy
almost
brutal
stableton
who
has
made
interesting
notes
on
individual
boys
entering
the
adolescent
period
emphasizes
the
importance
of
sympathy
appreciation
and
respect
in
dealing
with
this
age
they
must
now
be
talked
to
as
equals
and
in
this
way
their
habits
of
industry
and
even
their
dangerous
love
affairs
run
be
controlled
he
says
there
is
no
more
important
question
before
the
teaching
fraternity
today
than
how
to
deal
justly
and
successfully
with
boys
at
this
time
of
life
this
is
the
age
when
they
drop
out
of
school
in
far
too
large
numbers
and
he
thinks
that
the
small
percentage
of
male
graduates
from
our
high
schools
is
due
to
the
inability
of
the
average
grammar
grade
or
teacher
to
deal
rightly
with
boys
in
this
critical
period
of
their
school
life
most
teachers
know
all
their
bad
points
but
fail
to
discover
their
good
ones
the
fine
disciplinarian
the
mechanical
movement
of
whose
school
is
so
admirable
and
who
does
not
realize
the
new
need
of
liberty
or
how
mentally
and
physically
all
are
at
this
age
should
be
supplanted
by
one
who
can
look
into
the
heart
and
by
a
glance
make
the
boy
feel
that
he
or
she
is
his
friend
the
weakest
work
in
our
schools
is
the
handling
of
boys
entering
the
adolescent
period
of
life
and
there
is
no
greater
blessing
that
can
come
to
a
boy
at
this
age
when
he
does
not
understand
himself
than
a
good
strong
teacher
that
understands
him
has
faith
in
him
and
will
day
by
day
lead
him
till
he
can
walk
alone
small
found
the
teacher
a
focus
of
imitation
whence
many
influences
both
physical
and
mental
irradiated
to
the
pupils
every
accent
gesture
automatism
like
and
dislike
is
caught
consciously
and
unconsciously
every
intellectual
interest
in
the
teacher
permeates
the
class
liars
if
trusted
became
honest
those
treated
as
ladies
and
gentlemen
act
so
those
told
by
favorite
teachers
of
the
good
things
they
are
capable
of
feel
a
strong
impulsion
to
do
them
some
older
children
are
almost
transformed
by
being
made
companions
to
teachers
by
having
their
good
traits
recognized
and
by
frank
apologies
by
the
teacher
when
in
error
an
interesting
and
unsuspected
illustration
of
the
growth
of
independence
with
adolescence
was
found
in
papers
from
the
second
to
eighth
grades
on
the
characteristics
of
the
best
teacher
as
seen
by
children
in
the
second
and
third
grades
all
and
in
the
fourth
per

in

this
falls
off
rapidly
in

sixth
seventh
and
eighth
grades
to
per
cent
while
at
the
same
time
the
quality
of
patience
in
the
upper
grades
rises
from
a
mention
by
two
to
per

sanford

collated

as
to
who
of
all
their
past
teachers
did
them
most
good
and
wherein
whom
they
loved
and
disliked
most
and
why
his
most
striking
result
is
presented
in
which
shows
that
fourteen
in
girls
and
sixteen
in
boys
is
the
age
in
which
most
good
was
felt
to
have
been
done
and
that
curves
culminating
at
twelve
for
both
sexes
but
not
falling
rapidly
until
fifteen
or
sixteen
represent
the
period
when
the
strongest
and
most
indelible
dislikes
were
felt
what
seems
to
be
most
appreciated
in
teachers
is
the
giving
of
purpose
arousing
of
ideals
kindling
of
ambition
to
be
something
or
do
something
and
so
giving
an
object
in
life
encouragement
to
overcome
circumstances
and
in
general
inspiring
and
giving
direction
next
came
personal
sympathy
and
interest
kindness
confidence
a
little
praise
being
understood
and
next
special
help
in
lessons
or
timely
and
kindly
advice
while
stability
and
poise
of
character
purity
the
absence
of
hypocrisy
independence
personal
beauty
athleticism
and
vigor
are
prominent
it
is
singular
that
those
of
each
sex
have
been
most
helped
by
their
own
sex
and
that
this
prominence
is
far
greatest
in
men
of
the
men
and
nearly
of
the
women
however
got
most
help
from
men
male
teachers
especially
near
adolescence
seem
most
helpful
for
both
sexes
the
qualities
that
inspire
most
dislike
are
malevolence
sarcasm
unjust
punishment
suspicion
severity
sternness
absence
of
laughing
and
smiling
indifference
threats
and
broken
vows
excessive
scolding
and
roasting
and
fondness
for
inflicting
blows
the
teacher
who
does
not
smile
is
far
more
liable
to
excite
animosity
most
boys
dislike
men
most
and
girls
dislikes
are
about
divided
the
stories
of
school
cruelties
and
indignities
are
painful
often
inveterate
grudges
are
established
by
little
causes
and
it
is
singular
how
permanent
and
indelible
strong
dislike
are
for
the
majority
of
children
in
many
cases
aversions
engendered
before
ten
have
lasted
with
little
diminution
till
maturity
and
there
is
a
sad
record
of
children
who
have
lost
a
term
a
year
or
dropped
school
altogether
because
of
ill
treatment
or
partiality
nearly
two
thousand
children
were
asked
what
they
would
do
in
a
specific
case
of
conflict
between
teacher
and
parents
it
was
found
that
while
for
young
children
parental
authority
was
preferred
a
marked
decline
began
about
eleven
and
was
most
rapid
after
fourteen
in
girls
and
fifteen
in
boys
and
that
there
was
a
nearly
corresponding
increase
in
the
number
of
pubescents
who
preferred
the
authority
the
reasons
for
their
choice
were
also
analyzed
and
it
was
found
that
whereas
for
the
young
unconditioned
authority
was
generally
satisfactory
with
pubesecents
abstract
authority
came
into
marked
predominance
until
when
the
children
have
reached
the
age
of
sixteen
almost
per
cent
of
their
reasons
belong
to
this
class
and
the
children
show
themselves
able
to
extend
the
idea
of
authority
without
violence
to
their
sense
of
justice
on
a
basis
of
papers
answering
the
question
whom
of
anyone
ever
heard
or
read
of
they
would
like
to
resemble
barnes
found
that
girls
ideals
were
far
more
often
found
in
the
immediate
circle
of
their
acquaintance
than
boys
and
that
those
within
that
circle
were
more
often
in
their
own
family
but
that
the
tendency
to
go
outside
their
personal
knowledge
and
choose
historical
and
public
characters
was
greatly
augmented
at
puberty
when
also
the
heroes
of
philanthropy
showed
marked
gain
in
prominence
boys
rarely
chose
women
as
their
ideals
but
in
america
half
the
girls
at
eight
and
at
eighteen
chose
male
characters
the
range
of
important
women
ideals
among
the
girls
was
surprisingly
small
barnes
fears
that
if
from
the
choice
of
relative
as
ideals
the
expansion
to
remote
or
world
heroes
is
too
fast
it
may
lead
to
disintegration
of
character
and
reckless
living
if
on
the
other
hand
it
is
expanded
too
slowly
we
shall
have
that
arrested
development
which
makes
good
ground
in
which
to
grow
stupidity
brutality
and
drunkenness
the
first
fruits
of
a
sluggish
and
mind
no
one
can
consider
the
regularity
with
which
local
ideals
die
out
and
are
replaced
by
world
ideals
without
feeling
that
he
is
in
the
presence
of
forces
and
this
emphasizes
the
fact
that
the
teacher
or
parent
does
not
work
in
a
world
governed
by
caprice
the
compositions
written
by
thousands
of
children
in
new
york
on
what
they
wanted
to
do
when
they
were
grown
up
were
collated
by
dr
thurber
the
replies
were
serious
and
showed
that
poor
children
looked
forward
willingly
to
severe
labor
and
the
increased
earnestness
of
adolescent
years
and
the
better
answers
to
the
question
were
noteworthy
all
anticipated
giving
up
the
elastic
joyousness
of
childhood
and
felt
the
need
of
patience
up
to
ten
there
was
an
increase
in
the
number
of
those
who
had
two
or
more
desires
this
number
declined
rapidly
at
eleven
rose
as
rapidly
at
twelve
and
slowly
fell
later
preferences
for
a
teacher
life
exceeded
in
girls
up
to
nine
fell
rapidly
at
eleven
increased
slightly
the
next
year
and
declined
thereafter
the
ideal
of
becoming
a
dressmaker
and
milliner
increased
till
ten
fell
at
eleven
rose
rapidly
to
a
maximum
at
thirteen
when
it
eclipsed
teaching
and
then
fell
permanently
again
the
professions
of
clerk
and
stenographer
showed
a
marked
rise
from
eleven
and
a
half
the
number
of
boys
who
chose
the
occupation
attained
its
maximum
at
nine
and
its
minimum
at
twelve
with
a
slight
rise
to
fourteen
when
the
survey
ended
the
ideal
of
tradesman
culminated
at
eight
with
a
second
rise
at
thirteen
the
reason
to
earn
money
reached
its
high
maximum
of
fifty
per
cent
at
twelve
and
fell
very
rapidly
the
reason
because
i
like
it
culminated
at
ten
and
fell
steadily
thereafter
the
motive
that
influenced
the
choice
of
a
profession
and
which
was
altruistic
toward
parents
or
for
their
benefit
culminated
at
twelve
and
a
half
and
then
declined
the
desire
for
character
increased
somewhat
throughout
but
rapidly
after
twelve
and
the
impulse
to
do
good
to
the
world
which
had
risen
slowly
from
nine
mounted
sharply
after
thirteen
thus
at
eleven
all
the
ideas
and
tendencies
are
increasing
toward
a
maximum
at
twelve
we
find
the
altruistic
desires
for
the
welfare
of
parents
the
reason
earn
money
at
thirteen
the
desire
on
the
part
of
the
girls
to
be
dressmakers
also
to
be
clerks
and
stenographers
at
fourteen
culminates
the
desire
for
a
business
career
in
bank
or
office
among
the
boys
the
consciousness
of
life
uncertainties
which
appeared
first
at
twelve
the
desire
for
character
and
the
hope
of
doing
the
world
good
what
would
you
like
to
be
in
an
imaginary
new
city
was
a
question
answered
by
written
papers
one
hundred
and
fourteen
different
occupations
were
given
that
of
teacher
led
with
the
girls
at
every
age
except
thirteen
and
fourteen
when
dressmaker
and
milliner
took
precedence
the
motive
of
making
money
led
among
the
boys
at
every
age
except
fourteen
and
sixteen
when
occupations
chosen
because
they
were
liked
led
the
greatest
number
of
those
who
chose
the
parent
occupation
was
found
at
thirteen
but
from
that
age
it
steadily
declined
and
independent
choice
came
into
prominence
the
maximum
of
girls
who
chose
parental
vocations
was
at
fourteen
motives
of
philanthropy
reached
nearly
their
highest
point
in
girls
and
boys
at
thirteen
jegi
obtained
letters
addressed
to
real
or
imaginary
friends
from
german
children
in
milwaukee
asking
what
they
desired
to
do
when
they
grew
up
and
why
and
tabulated
returns
from
boys
and
girls
for
each
age
from
eight
to
fourteen
inclusive
he
also
found
a
steadily
decreasing
influence
of
relatives
to
thirteen
in
early
adolescence
the
personal
motive
of
choosing
an
occupation
because
it
was
liked
increased
while
from
twelve
in
boys
and
thirteen
in
girls
the
consideration
of
finding
easy
vocations
grew
rapidly
strong
cline
studied
by
the
census
method
returns
from
children
who
were
asked
what
they
wished
to
be
and
do
he
found
that
in
naming
both
ideals
and
occupations
girls
were
more
conservative
than
boys
but
more
likely
to
give
a
reason
for
their
choice
in
this
respect
country
children
resembled
boys
more
than
city
children
country
boys
were
prone
to
inattention
were
more
independent
and
able
to
care
for
themselves
suggesting
that
the
home
life
of
the
country
child
is
more
effective
in
shaping
ideals
and
character
than
that
of
the
city
child
industrial
occupations
are
preferred
by
the
younger
children
the
professional
and
technical
pursuits
increasing
with
age
judgments
of
rights
and
justice
with
the
young
are
more
prone
to
issue
from
emotional
rather
than
from
intellectual
processes
country
children
seem
more
altruistic
than
those
in
the
city
and
while
girls
are
more
sympathetic
than
boys
they
are
also
more
easily
prejudiced
many
of
these
returns
bear
unmistakable
marks
that
in
some
homes
and
schools
moralization
has
been
excessive
and
has
produced
a
sentimental
type
of
morality
and
often
a
feverish
desire
to
express
ethical
views
instead
of
trusting
to
suggestion
children
are
very
prone
to
have
one
code
of
ideals
for
themselves
and
another
for
others
boys
too
are
more
original
than
girls
and
country
children
more
than
city
children
friedrich
asked
german
school
children
what
person
they
chose
as
their
pattern
the
result
showed
differences
of
age
sex
and
creed
first
of
all
came
characters
in
history
which
seemed
to
show
that
this
study
for
children
of
the
sixth
and
seventh
grades
was
essentially
ethical
or
a
training
of
mood
and
disposition
and
this
writer
suggests
reform
in
this
respect
he
seems
to
think
that
the
chief
purpose
of
history
for
this
age
should
be
ethical
next
came
the
influence
of
the
bible
although
it
was
plain
that
this
was
rather
in
spite
of
the
catechism
and
the
method
of
memoriter
work
here
too
the
immediate
environment
at
this
age
furnished
few
ideals
four
and
per
cent
for
children
seem
to
have
keener
eyes
for
the
faults
than
for
the
virtues
of
those
near
them
religion
therefore
should
chiefly
be
directed
to
the
emotions
and
not
to
the
understanding
this
census
also
suggested
more
care
that
the
reading
of
children
should
contain
good
examples
in
their
environment
and
also
that
the
matter
of
instruction
should
be
more
fully
adapted
to
the
conditions
of
sex
friedrich
found
as
his
chief
age
result
that
children
of
the
seventh
or
older
class
in
the
german
schools
laid
distinctly
greater
stress
upon
characters
distinguished
by
bravery
and
courage
than
did
the
children
of
the
sixth
grade
while
the
latter
more
frequently
selected
characters
illustrating
piety
and
holiness
the
author
divided
his
characters
into
classes
illustrating
qualities
and
found
that
national
activity
led
with
piety
a
close
second
that
then
came
in
order
those
illustrating
firmness
of
faith
bravery
modesty
and
chastity
then
pity
and
sympathy
industry
goodness
patience
etc
taylor
young
hamilton
chambers
and
others
have
also
collected
interesting
data
on
what
children
and
young
people
hope
to
be
do
whom
they
would
like
to
be
or
resemble
etc
only
a
few
at
adolescence
feel
themselves
so
good
or
happy
that
they
are
content
to
be
themselves
most
show
more
or
less
discontent
at
their
lot
from
six
to
eleven
or
twelve
the
number
who
find
their
ideals
among
their
acquaintances
falls
off
rapidly
and
historical
characters
rise
to
a
maximum
at
or
before
the
earliest
teens
from
eleven
or
twelve
on
into
the
middle
teens
contemporary
ideals
increase
steadily
london
children
are
more
backward
in
this
expansion
of
ideals
than
americans
while
girls
choose
more
acquaintance
ideals
at
all
ages
than
do
boys
the
expansion
these
authors
also
trace
largely
to
the
study
of
history
the
george
washington
ideal
which
leads
all
the
rest
by
far
and
is
greatly
overworked
in
contrast
with
the
many
heroes
of
equal
rank
found
in
england
pales
soon
as
imperfections
are
seen
and
those
now
making
history
loom
up
this
is
the
normal
age
to
free
from
bondage
to
the
immediate
present
and
this
freedom
is
one
measure
of
education
bible
heroes
are
chosen
as
ideals
by
only
a
very
small
percentage
mostly
girls
far
more
characters
being
from
fiction
and
mythology
where
jesus
is
chosen
his
human
is
preferred
to
his
divine
side
again
it
would
seem
that
teachers
would
be
ideals
especially
as
many
girls
intend
to
teach
but
they
are
generally
unpopular
as
choices
in
an
ideal
system
they
would
be
the
first
step
in
expansion
from
home
ideals
military
heroes
and
inventors
play
leading
rôles
in
the
choices
of
pubescent
boys
girls
at
all
school
ages
and
increasingly
up
the
grades
prefer
foreign
ideals
to
be
the
wife
of
a
man
of
title
as
aristocracies
offer
special
opportunities
for
woman
to
shine
and
life
near
the
source
of
fashion
is
very
attractive
at
least
up
to
sixteen
the
saddest
fact
in
these
studies
is
that
nearly
half
our
american
pubescent
girls
or
nearly
three
times
as
many
as
in
england
choose
male
ideals
or
would
be
men
girls
too
have
from
six
to
fifteen
times
as
many
ideals
as
boys
in
this
significant
fact
we
realize
how
modern
woman
has
cut
loose
from
all
old
moorings
and
is
drifting
with
no
destination
and
no
anchor
aboard
while
her
sex
has
multiplied
in
all
lower
and
high
school
grades
its
ideals
are
still
too
masculine
teach
little
about
women
when
a
woman
bible
history
course
of
study
is
proposed
her
sex
fears
it
may
reduce
her
to
the
old
servitude
while
boys
rarely
and
then
only
when
very
young
choose
female
ideals
girls
preference
for
the
life
of
the
other
sex
sometimes
reaches
sixty
and
seventy
per
cent
the
divorce
between
the
life
preferred
and
that
demanded
by
the
interests
of
the
race
is
often
absolute
saddest
and
most
unnatural
of
all
is
the
fact
that
this
state
of
things
increases
most
rapidly
during
just
those
years
when
ideals
of
womanhood
should
be
developed
and
become
most
dominant
till
it
seems
as
if
the
female
character
was
threatened
with
disintegration
while
statistics
are
not
yet
sufficient
to
be
reliable
on
the
subject
there
is
some
indication
that
woman
later
slowly
reverts
toward
ideals
not
only
from
her
own
sex
but
also
from
the
circle
of
her
own
acquaintances
the
reasons
for
the
choice
of
ideals
are
various
and
not
yet
well
determined
civic
virtues
certainly
rise
material
and
utilitarian
considerations
do
not
seem
to
much
if
at
all
at
adolescence
and
in
some
data
decline
position
fame
honor
and
general
greatness
increase
rapidly
but
moral
qualities
rise
highest
and
also
fastest
just
before
and
near
puberty
and
continue
to
increase
later
yet
by
these
choices
both
sexes
but
girls
far
most
show
increasing
admiration
of
ethical
and
social
qualities
artistic
and
intellectual
traits
also
rise
quite
steadily
from
ten
or
eleven
onward
but
with
no
such
rapidity
and
reach
no
such
height
as
military
ability
and
achievement
for
boys
striking
in
these
studies
is
the
rapid
increase
especially
from
eight
to
fourteen
of
the
sense
of
historic
time
for
historic
persons
these
long
since
dead
are
no
longer
spoken
of
as
now
living
most
of
these
choices
are
direct
expressions
of
real
differences
of
taste
and
character
kline
and
france
have
defined
as
anything
that
the
individual
may
acquire
which
sustains
and
prolongs
life
favors
survival
and
gives
an
advantage
over

early
in

children
evince
signs
of
ownership
letourneau
says
that
the
notion
of
private
property
which
seems
to
us
so
natural
dawned
late
and
slowly
and
that
common
ownership
was
the
rule
among
primitive
people
value
is
sometimes
measured
by
use
and
sometimes
by
the
work
required
to
produce
it
before
puberty
there
is
great
eagerness
to
possess
things
that
are
of
immediate
service
but
after
its
dawn
the
desire
of
possession
takes
another
form
and
money
for
its
own
sake
which
is
at
first
rather
an
abstraction
comes
to
be
respected
or
regarded
as
an
object
of
extreme
desire
because
it
is
seen
to
be
the
embodiment
of
all
values
the
money
sense
as
it
is
now
often
called
is
very
complex
and
has
not
yet
been
satisfactorily
analyzed
by
psychology
ribot
and
others
trace
its
origin
to
provision
which
they
think

monroe

from

and

from

to

in
answer
to
the
question
as
to
what
they
would
do
with
a
small
monthly
allowance
the
following

marked
increase
at
the
dawn
of
adolescence
of
the
number
who
would

this
tendency
to
thrift
is
strongest
in
boys
and
both
sexes
often
show
the
tendency
to
moralize
that
is
so
strong
in
the
early
teens
much
of
our
school
work
in
arithmetic
is
dominated
by
the
money
sense
and
school
at
first
for
the
poor
are
now
extending
to
children
of
all
classes
this
sense
tends
to
prevent
pauperism
prodigality
is
an
immense
stimulus
to
the
imagination
and
develops
purpose
to
pursue
a
distant
object
for
a
long
time
to
see
all
things
and
values
in
terms
of
money
has
of
course
its
pedagogic
and
ethical
limitations
but
there
is
a
stage
when
it
is
a
great
educational
advance
and
it
too
is
full
of
phylogenetic
suggestions
judgement
cronies
the
two
following
observations
afford
a
glimpse
of
the
development
of
moral
judgments
from
boys
and
girls
of
each
age
from
six
to
sixteen
who
answered
the
question
as
to
what
should
be
done
to
a
girl
with
a
new
box
of
paints
who
beautified
the
parlor
chairs
with
them
with
a
wish
to
please
her
mother
the
following
conclusion
was
drawn
most
of
the
younger
children
would
whip
the
girl
but
from
fourteen
on
the
number
declines
very
rapidly
few
of
the
young
children
suggest
explaining
why
it
was
wrong
while
at
twelve
and
at
sixteen
would
explain
the
motive
of
the
younger
children
in
punishment
is
revenge
with
the
older
ones
that
of
preventing
a
repetition
of
the
act
comes
in
and
higher
and
later
comes
the
purpose
of
reform
with
age
comes
also
a
marked
distinction
between
the
act
and
its
motive
and
a
sense
of
the
girl
ignorance
only
the
older
children
would
suggest
extracting
a
promise
not
to
offend
again
thus
with
puberty
comes
a
change
of
from
judging
actions
by
results
to
judging
by
motives
and
only
the
older
ones
see
that
wrong
can
be
done
if
there
are
no
bad
consequences
there
is
also
with
increased
years
a
great
development
of
the
quality
of
mercy
one
hundred
children
of
each
sex
and
age
between
six
and
sixteen
asked
what
they
would
do
with
a
burglar
the
question
stating
that
the
penalty
was
five
years
in
prison
of
the
younger
children
nearly
ignored
the
law
and
fixed
upon
some
other
penalty
but
from
twelve
years
there
is
a
steady
advance
in
those
who
would
inflict
the
legal
penalty
while
at
sixteen
per
cent
would
have
the
criminal
punished
according
to
law
thus
with
the
dawn
of
adolescence
at
the
age
of
twelve
or
shortly
after
comes
the
recognition
of
a
larger
life
a
life
to
be
lived
in
common
with
others
and
with
this
recognition
the
desire
to
sustain
the
social
code
made
for
the
common
welfare
and
punishment
is
no
longer
regarded
as
an
individual
and
arbitrary
matter
from
another
question
answered
by
children
it
was
found
that
with
the
development
of
the
psychic
faculties
in
youth
there
was
an
increasing
appreciation
of
punishment
as
preventive
an
increasing
sense
of
the
value
of
individuality
and
of
the
tendency
to
demand
protection
of
personal
rights
a
change
from
a
sense
of
justice
based
on
feeling
and
on
faith
in
authority
to
that
based
on
reason
and
understanding
children
attitude
toward
punishment
for
weak
time
sense
tested
by
children
from
six
to
sixteen
showed
also
a
marked
pubescent
increase
in
the
sense
of
the
need
of
the
remedial
function
of
punishment
as
distinct
from
the
view
of
it
as
vindictive
or
getting
even
common
in
earlier
years
there
is
also
a
marked
increase
in
discriminating
the
kinds
and
degrees
of
offenses
in
taking
account
of
mitigating
circumstances
the
inconvenience
caused
others
the
involuntary
nature
of
the
offense
and
the
purpose
of
the
culprit
all
this
continues
to
increase
up
to
sixteen
where
these
studies
leave
the
child
an
interesting
effect
of
the
social
instinct
appears
in
august
mayer
elaborate
study
made
up
on
fourteen
boys
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
grade
of
a
würzburg
school
to
determine
whether
they
could
work
better
together
or
alone
the
tests
were
in
dictation
mental
and
written
arithmetic
memory
and
ebbinghaus
combination
exercises
and
all
were
given
with
every
practicable
precaution
to
make
the
other
conditions
uniform
the
conclusions
demonstrate
the
advantages
of
collective
over
individual
instruction
under
the
former
condition
emulation
is
stronger
and
work
more
rapid
and
better
in
quality
from
this
it
is
inferred
that
pupils
should
not
be
grouped
according
to
ability
for
the
dull
are
most
stimulated
by
the
presence
of
the
bright
the
bad
by
the
good
etc
thus
work
at
home
is
prone
to
deteriorate
and
experimental
pedagogy
shows
that
the
social
impulse
is
on
the
whole
a
stronger
spur
for
boys
of
eleven
or
twelve
than
the
absence
of
distraction
which
solitude
brings
from
the
answers
of
boys
and
girls
from
seven
to
sixteen
on
the
kind
of
chum
they
liked
best
it
appears
that
with
the
teens
children
are
more
anxious
for
chums
that
can
keep
secrets
and
dress
neatly
and
there
is
an
increased
number
who
are
liked
for
qualities
that
supplement
rather
than
duplicate
those
of
the
chooser
there
is
an
apparent
struggle
between
the
real
actual
self
and
the
ideal
self
a
pretty
strong
desire
to
have
a
chum
that
embodies
the
traits
youth
most
desire
but
which
they
are
conscious
of
lacking
the
strong
like
the
weak
those
full
of
fun
the
serious
the
timid
the
bold
the
small
the
large
etc
only
children
illustrate
differing
effects
of
isolation
while
mashes
and
crushes
and
with
selfishness
for
two
show
the
results
of
abnormal
restriction
of
the
irradiation
of
the
social
instinct
which
should
now
occur
small
after
pointing
out
that
communal
animals
are
more
intelligent
than
those
with
solitary
habits
and
that
even
to
name
all
the
irradiations
of
the
social
instinct
would
be
write
a
history
of
the
human
race
studied
nearly
five
hundred
cases
of
eminent
men
who
developed
proclivities
to
solitude
it
is
interesting
to
observe
in
how
many
of
these
cases
this
was
developed
in
adolescence
when
with
the
horror
of
mediocrity
comes
introspection
apathy
irresolution
and
subjectivism
the
grounds
of
repulsion
from
society
at
this
age
may
be
disappointed
hunger
for
praise
wounded
vanity
the
reaction
from
or
the
nursing
of
some
high
ideals
as
it
is
slowly
realized
that
in
society
the
individual
can
not
be
absolute
the
motives
to
may
be
because
youth
feels
its
lack
of
physical
or
moral
force
to
compete
with
men
or
they
may
be
due
to
the
failure
of
others
to
concede
to
the
exactions
of
inordinate
egotism
and
are
directly
proportional
to
the
impulse
to
magnify
self
or
to
the
remoteness
of
common
social
interests
from
immediate
personal
desire
or
need
and
inversely
as
the
number
and
range
of
interests
seen
to
be
common
and
the
clearness
with
which
social
relations
are
realized
while
maturity
of
character
needs
some
solitude
too
much
dwarfs
it
and
more
or
less
of
the
same
paralysis
of
association
follows
which
is
described
in
the
nostalgia
of
arctic
journeys
deserts
being
lost
in
the
jungle
solitary
confinement
and
in
the
interesting
stories
of
feral
men
in
some
of
these
cases
the
mind
is
saved
from
entire
stultification
by
pets
imaginary
companions
tasks
etc
normally
the
tendency
to
solitude
at
adolescence
indicates
not
fulness
but
want
and
a
judicious
balance
between
rest
and
work
pursuit
of
favorite
lines
genuine
sympathy
and
wise
companionship

generally
normalize

and

the
spontaneous
tendency
to
develop
social
and
political
organizations
among
boys
in
pubescent
years
was
well
seen
in
a
school
near
baltimore
in
the
midst
of
an
farm
richly
diversified
with
swamp
and
forest
and
abounding
with
birds
squirrels
rabbits
etc
soon
after
the
opening
of
this
school
the
boys
gathered
nuts
in
parties
when
a
tree
was
reached
which
others
had
shaken
an
unwritten
law
soon
required
those
who
wished
to
shake
it
further
first
to
pile
up
all
nuts
under
the
tree
while
those
who
failed
to
do
so
were
universally
regarded
as
dishonest
and
every
boy
hand
was
against
them
to
pile
them
involved
much
labor
so
that
the
second
party
usually
sought
fresh
trees
and
partial
shaking
practically
gave
possession
of
all
the
fruits
on
a
tree
they
took
birds
eggs
freely
and
whenever
a
bird
was
found
in
building
or
a
squirrel
hole
was
discovered
the
finder
tacked
his
name
on
the
tree
and
thereby
confirmed
his
ownership
as
he
did
if
he
placed
a
box
in
which
a
nest
was
built
the
ticket
must
not
blow
off
and
the
right
at
first
lasted
only
one
season
in
the
every
trap
that
was
set
preëmpted
ground
for
a
fixed
number
of
yards
about
it
some
grasping
boys
soon
made
many
traps
and
set
them
all
over
a
valuable
district
so
that
the
common
land
fell
into
a
few
hands
traps
were
left
out
all
winter
and
simply
set
the
next
spring
all
these
rights
finally
came
into
the
ownership
of
two
or
three
boys
who
slowly
acquired
the
right
and
bequeathed
their
claims
to
others
for
a
consideration
when
they
left
school
the
monopolists
often
had
a
large
surplus
of
rabbits
which
they
bartered
for
butters
the
unit
being
the
ounce
of
daily
allowance
these
could
be
represented
by
tickets
transferred
so
that
debts
were
paid
with
butters
that
had
never
been
seen
an
agrarian
party
arose
and
demanded
a
redistribution
of
land
from
the
monopolists
as
sir
henry
maine
shows
often
happened
in
the
old
village
community
legislation
and
judicial
procedure
were
developed
and
quarrels
settled
by
arbitration
ordeal
and
wager
and
punishment
by
bumping
often
followed
the
decision
of
the
boy
scales
of
prices
for
commodities
in
butters
or
in
were
evolved
so
that
we
here
have
an
almost
entirely
spontaneous
but
amazingly
rapid
recapitulation
of
the
social
development
of
the
race
by
these
boys
from
a
study
of
children
organizations
described
as
a
language
lesson
in
school
composition
sheldon
arrives
at
some
interesting
results
american
children
tend
strongly
to
institutional
activities
only
about
thirty
per
cent
of
all
not
having
belonged
to
some
such
organization
imitation
plays
a
very
important
rôle
and
girls
take
far
more
kindly
than
boys
to
societies
organized
by
adults
for
their
benefit
they
are
also
more
governed
by
adult
and
altruistic
motives
in
forming
their
organizations
while
boys
are
nearer
to
primitive
man
before
ten
comes
the
period
of
free
spontaneous
imitation
of
every
form
of
adult
institution
the
child
reproduces
sympathetically
miniature
copies
of
the
life
around
him
on
a
farm
his
play
is
raking
threshing
building
barns
or
on
the
seashore
he
makes
ships
and
harbors
in
general
he
plays
family
store
church
and
chooses
officers
simply
because
adults
do
the
feeling
of
caste
almost
absent
in
the
young
culminates
about
ten
and
declines
thereafter
from
ten
to
fourteen
however
associations
assume
a
new
character
boys
especially
cease
to
imitate
adult
organizations
and
tend
to
form
social
units
characteristic
of
lower
stages
of
human
evolution
pirates
robbers
soldiers
lodges
and
other
savage
reversionary
combinations
where
the
strongest
and
boldest
is
the
leader
they
build
huts
wear
feathers
and
tomahawks
as
badges
carry
knives
and
make
raids
and
sell
the
loot
cowards
alone
together
they
fear
nothing
their
imagination
is
perhaps
inflamed
by
flash
literature
and
such
associations
often
break
out
in
decadent
country
communities
where
with
fewer
and
feebler
offspring
lax
notions
of
family
discipline
prevail
and
hoodlumism
is
the
direct
result
of
the
passing
of
the
rod
these
barbaric
societies
have
their
place
and
give
vigor
but
if
unreduced
later
as
in
many
unsettled
portions
of
this
country
a
semisavage
state
of
society
results
at
twelve
the
predatory
function
is
normally
subordinated
and
if
it
is
not
it
becomes
dangerous
because
the
members
are
no
longer
satisfied
with
mere
play
but
are
stronger
and
abler
to
do
harm
and
the
spice
of
danger
and
its
fascination
may
issue
in
crime
athleticism
is
now
the
form
into
which
these
wilder
instincts
can
be
best
transmuted
and
where
they
find
harmless
and
even
wholesome
vent
another
change
early
in
adolescence
is
the
increased
number
of
social
literary
and
even
philanthropic
organizations
and
institutions
for
mutual
help
perhaps
against
vice
for
having
a
good
time
or
for
holding
picnics
and
parties
altruism
now
begins
to
make
itself
felt
as
a
motive
life
and
student
life
is
perhaps
the
best
of
all
fields
unworked
though
it
is
for
studying
the
natural
history
of
adolescence
its
modern
record
is
over
eight
hundred
years
old
and
it
is
marked
with
the
signatures
of
every
age
yet
has
essential
features
that
do
not
vary
cloister
and
garrison
rules
have
never
been
enforced
even
in
the
hospice
bursa
inn
house
hall
or
dormitory
and
loco
in
place
of
a
parent
practises
are
impossible
especially
with
large
numbers
the
very
word
school
means
leisure
and
in
a
world
of
toil
and
moil
suggests
paradise
some
have
urged
that
youth
exempt
from
the
struggle
to
live
and
left
to
the
freedom
of
their
own
inclinations
might
serve
as
a
biological
and
ethnic
compass
to
point
out
the
goal
of
human
destiny
but
the
spontaneous
expressions
of
this
best
age
and
condition
of
life
with
no
other
occupation
than
their
own
development
have
shown
reversions
as
often
as
progress
the
rupture
of
home
ties
stimulates
every
wider
vicarious
expression
of
the
social
instinct
each
taste
and
trait
can
find
congenial
companionship
in
others
and
thus
be
stimulated
to
more
intensity
and
very
much
that
has
been
hitherto
repressed
in
the
adolescent
soul
is
now
reënforced
by
association
and
may
become
excessive
and
even
aggressive
while
many
of
the
of
childhood
are
lost
those
of
this
stage
are
more
accessible
in
savage
and
life
freedom
is
the
native
air
and
vital
breath
of
student
life
the
sense
of
personal
liberty
is
absolutely
indispensable
for
moral
maturity
and
just
as
truth
can
not
be
found
without
the
possibility
of
error
so
the
non
ability
not
to
sin
precedes
the
posse
inability
to
sin
and
professors
must
make
abroad
application
of
the
rule
non
tollit
abuse
does
not
do
away
with
use
the
student
must
have
much
freedom
to
be
lazy
make
his
own
minor
morals
vent
his
disrespect
for
what
he
can
see
no
use
in
be
among
strangers
to
act
himself
out
and
form
a
personality
of
his
own
be
baptized
with
the
revolutionary
and
skeptical
spirit
and
go
to
extremes
at
the
age
when
excesses
teach
wisdom
with
amazing
rapidity
if
he
is
to
become
a
true
knight
of
the
spirit
and
his
own
master
ziegler
frankly
told
german
students
that
about
of
them
would
be
morally
lost
in
this
process
but
insisted
that
on
the
whole
more
good
was
done
than
by
restraint
for
he
said
youth
is
now
in
the
stage
of
bell
when
it
was
molten
metal
of
all
safeguards
i
believe
a
rightly
cultivated
sense
of
honor
is
the
most
effective
at
this
age
sadly
as
the
written
code
of
student
honor
in
all
lands
needs
revision
and
partial
freaky
and
utterly
perverted
tainted

cowardly
as
it
often
is
it
really
means
what

sublime
precept

said
that
and
laziness
cowardice
falsehood
were
the
three
dishonorable
things
for
students
if
they
would
study
the
history
and
enter
into
the
spirit
of
their
own
fraternities
they
would
often
have
keener
and
broader
ideas
of
honor
to
which
they
are
happily
so
sensitive
if
professors
made
it
always
a
point
of
honor
to
confess
and
never
to
conceal
the
limitation
of
their
knowledge
would
scorn
all
pretense
of

originality
frankly
where
it
belongs
teach
no

they
do
not
profoundly
believe
or
topics
in
which
they
are
not
interested
and
withhold
nothing
from
those
who
want
the
truth
they
could
from
this
vantage
with
more
effect
bring
students
to
feel
that
the
laziness
that
while
outwardly
conforming
does
no
real
inner
work
that
getting
a
diploma
as
a
professor
lately
said
an
average
student
could
do
on
one
hour
study
a
day
living
beyond

and
thus
imposing
a
hardship
on
parents
greater
than
the
talent
of
the
son
justifies
accepting
stipends
not
needed
especially
to
the
deprivation
of
those
more
needy
using
dishonest
ways
of
securing
rank
in
studies
or
positions
on
teams
or
social
standing
are
one
and
all
not
only
ungentlemanly
but
cowardly
and
mean
and
the
axe
would
be
laid
at
the
root
of
the
tree
honor
should
impel
students
to
go
nowhere
where
they
conceal
their
college
their
fraternity
or
even
their
name
to
keep
themselves
immaculate
from
all
contact
with
that
class
of
women
which
ziegler
states
brought
per
cent
of
the
students
of
the
university
of
berlin
in
a
single
year
to
physicians
to
remember
that
other
sisters
are
as
cherished
as
their
own
to
avoid
those
sins
against
confiding
innocence
which
cry
for
vengeance
as
did
valentine
against
faust
and
which
strengthen
the
hate
of
social
classes
and
make
mothers
and
sisters
seem
tedious
because
low
ideas
of
womanhood
have
been
implanted
and
which
give
a
taste
for
mucky
authors

reek
with
suggestiveness
and
to
avoid
the
waste
of
nerve
substance
and
nerve
weakness
in
ways
which
ibsen

different
realm
forbush
undertakes
an
analysis
of
many
such
clubs
which
he
divides
according
to
their
purpose
into
nine
chief
classes
physical
training
handicraft
literary
social
civic
and
patriotic
ethical
religious
these
he
classifies
as
to
age
of
the
boys
his
purview
generally
ending
at
seventeen
discusses
and
tabulates
the
most
favorable
number
the
instincts
chiefly
utilized
the
kinds
of
education
gained
in
each
and
its
percentage
of
interest
and
the
qualities
developed
he
commends
riis
mode
of
pulling
the
of
a
rather
dangerous
by
becoming
an
adult
honorary
member
and
interpreting
the
impulsions
of
this
age
in
the
direction
of
adventure
instead
of
in
that
of
mischief
he
reminds
us
that
nearly
of
the
inhabitants
of
america
are
adolescents
that
are
boys
between
twelve
and
sixteen
that

taught
the
motto
is
the
hand
of
the
diligent
shall
bear
rule
its
watchword
is
loyalty
and
the
prime
objects
are
to
promote
a
spirit
of
loyalty
to
christ
among
the
boys
of
the
club
and
to
learn
about
and
work
for

speaking

thousand

of
the
monthly
organ
in
addition
to
its
mission
of
sentiment
and
to
make

more
effective
this
organization
clearly
needs
to
make
more
provision
for
the
intellectual
element
by
or
constructed
courses
or
at
least
references
on
the
life
history
habits
and
instincts
of
animals

it
also
needs
more
recognition
that
modern
charity
is
a
science
as
well
as
a
virtue
f
the
coming
men
of
america

lodge
started
by
a
boy
in
chicago
in
imitation
of
such
ideas
of
masons
as
its
founder
could
get
from
his
older
brother
and
its
meetings
were
first
held
in
a
basement
on
this
basis
older
heads
aided
in
its
development
so
that
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
helped
out
by
parents
the
organization
is
now
represented
in
every
state

not
very
affectionate
they
take
pleasure
in
obliging

imitating
those
they
like
and
perhaps
in
disobliging
those
they
dislike
they
have
much
selfishness
and
little

as
this
period
draws
to
a
close

should
have

much
more
than

now
does

be

form
with
the
outlines
of
many
of
the
best
works
in

through
many
if
not
most
forms
of
what
parents
and
teachers
commonly
call
badness
and
professor
yoder
even
calls
meanness
he
should
have
fought

to
and
already
recovering
from
as
many
forms
of
ethical
mumps
and
measles
as
by
having
in
mild
form
now
he
can
be
rendered
immune
to
later
when
they
become
far
more
dangerous
because
his
moral
and
religious
as
well
as
his
rational
nature
is
normally
rudimentary
he
is
not
depraved
but
only
in
a
savage
or
stage
although
to
a
and
truly
parental
soul
that
does
not
call
what
causes
it
inconvenience
by
opprobrious
names
an
altogether
lovable
and
even
fascinating
stage
the
more
we
know
of
boyhood
the
more
narrow
and
often
selfish
do
adult
ideals

it
appear

industrious
thoughtful
altruistic
quiet
polite
respectful
obedient
gentlemanly
orderly
always
in
good
toilet
docile
to

who
turns
away
from
stories
that
reek
with
gore
prefers
adult
companionship
to
that
of
his
mates
refuses
all
low
associates
speaks
standard
english
or
is
as
pious
and
deeply
in
love
with
religious
services
as
the
typical
maiden
teacher
or
the
la
parent
wishes
such
a
boy
is
either
and
anemic
and
precocious
by
nature
a
repressed
overtrained
conventionalized
manikin
a
hypocrite
as
some
can
become
under
pressure
thus
early
in
life
or
else
a
genius
of
some
kind
with
a
little
of
all
these
but
with
the
teens
all
this
begins
to
be
changed
and
many
of
these
precepts
must
be
gradually
reversed
there
is
an
outburst
of
growth
that
needs
a
large
part
of
the
total
kinetic
energy
of
the
body
there
is
a
new
interest
in
adults
a
passion
to
be
treated
like
elders
to
make
plans
for
the
future
a
new
sensitiveness
to
adult
praise
or
blame
the
large
muscles
have
their
innings
and
there
is
a
new
clumsiness
of
body
and
mind
the
expand
and
blushing
is
increased
new
sensations
and
feelings
arise
the
imagination
blossoms
love
of
nature
is
born
music
is
felt
in
a
new
more
inward
way
fatigue
comes
easier
and
sooner
and
if
heredity
and
environment
enable
the
individual
to
cross
this
bridge
successfully
there
is
sometimes
almost
a
break
of
continuity
and
a
new
being
emerges
the
drill
methods
of
the
preceding
period
must
be
slowly
relaxed
and
new
appeals
made
to
freedom
and
interest
we
can
no
longer
coerce
a
break
but
must
lead
and
inspire
if
we
would
avoid
arrest
individuality
must
have
a
longer
tether
never
is
the
power
to
appreciate
so
far

if

a

chamberlain
estimates
that
our

contains
more

two

as

as
all

left
us
from
the
latin
many
savage
languages
contain
only
a
very
few
thousand
and
some
but
a
few
hundred
words
our
tongue
is
essentially
saxon
in
its
vocabulary
and
its
spirit
and
from
the
time
when
it
was
despised
and
vulgar
has
followed
an
expansion
policy
swallowing
with
little
modification
terms
not
only
from
classical
antiquity
but
from
all
modern
languages

invents
new

with
no

like
those
of
lear
carrol
and
many
others
in
this
vast
field
the
mind
of
the
child
early
begins
to
take
flight
here
his
soul
finds
its
native
breath
and
vital
air
he
may
live
as
a
peasant
using
as
max
müller
says
many
do
but
a
few
hundred
words
during
his
lifetime
or
he
may
need
like
milton
like
shakespeare
or
like
huxley
who
commanded
both
literary
and
technical
terms
while
in
understanding
which
far
outstrips
use
a
philologist
may
master
perhaps
or
words
the
content
of
a
tongue
may
contain
only
and
terms
for
immediate
practical
life
or
this
content
may
be
indefinitely
elaborated
in
a
rich
literature
and
science
the
former
is
generally
well
on
in
its
development
before
speech
itself
becomes
an
abject
of
study
greek
literature
was
fully
grown
when
the
sophists
and
finally
aristotle
developed
the
rudiments
of
grammar
the
parts
of
speech
being
at
first
closely
related
with
his
ten
metaphysical
categories
our
modern
tongue
had
the
fortune
unknown
to
those
of
antiquity
when
it
was
crude
and
despised
to
be
patronized
and
regulated
by
latin
grammarians
and
has
had
a
long
experience
both
for
good
and
evil
with
their
conserving
and
uniformitizing
instincts
it
has
too
a
long
history
of
resistance
to
this
control
once
spelling
was
a
matter
of
fashion
or
even
individual
taste
and
as
the
constraint
grew
two
pedagogues
in
the
thirteenth
century
fought
a
duel
for
the
right
spelling
of
the
word
and
that
maintained
by
the
survivor
prevailed
phonic
and
economic
influences
are
now
again
making
some
headway
against
orthographic
orthodoxy
here
so
with
definitions
in
the
days
of
johnson
dictionary
individuality
still
had
wide
range
in
determining
meanings
in
pronunciation
too
we
may
now
pronounce
the
word
in
six
ways
all
sanctioned
by
dictionaries
of
our
tongue
in
particular
it
is
true
as
tylor
says
in
general
condensing
a
longer
passage
take
language
all
in
all
it
is
the
product
of
a
ingenuity
and
of
the
great
rule
of
thumb
it
is
an
old
barbaric
engine
which
in
its
highest
development
is
altered
patched
and
tinkered
into
capability
it
is
originally
and
naturally
a
product
of
low
culture
developed
by
ages
of
conscious
and
unconscious
improvement
to
answer
more
or
less
perfectly
the
requirements
of
modern
civilization
it
is
plain
therefore
that
no
grammar
and
least
of
all
that
derived
from
the
prim
meager
latin
contingent
of
it
is
adequate
to
legislate
for
the
free
spirit
of
our
magnificent
tongue
again
if
this
is
ever
done
and
english
ever
has
a
grammar
that
is
to
it
what
latin
grammar
is
to
that
language
it
will
only
be
when
the
psychology
of
speech
represented
in
wundt
psychologie
der
sprache
which
is
now
compiling
and
organizing
the
best
elements
from
all
grammars
is
complete
the
reason
why
english
speakers
find
such
difficulty
in
learning
other
languages
is
because
ours
has
so
far
outgrown
them
by
throwing
off
not
only
inflections
but
many
old
rules
of
syntax
that
we
have
had
to
go
backward
to
an
earlier
and
more
obsolescent
stage
of
human
development
in
at
the
council
of
constance
when
emperor
sigismund
was
rebuked
for
a
wrong
gender
he
replied
i
am
king
of
the
romans
and
above
grammar
thomas
jefferson
later
wrote
where
strictures
of
grammar
does
not
weaken
expression
it
should
be
attended
to
but
where
by
a
small
grammatical
negligence
the
energy
of
an
idea
is
condensed
or
a
word
stands
for
a
sentence
i
hold
grammatical
rigor
in
contempt
browning
whitman
and
kipling
deliberately
violate
grammar
and
secure
thereby
unique
effects
neither
asking
nor
needing
excuse
by
general
consent
both
high
school
and
college
youth
in
this
country
are
in
an
advanced
stage
of
degeneration
in
the
command
of
this
the
world
greatest
organ
of
the
intellect
and
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
study
of
english
often
continues
from
primary
into
college
grades
that
no
topic
counts
for
more
and
that
marked
deficiency
here
often
debars
from
all
other
courses
every
careful
study
of
the
subject
for
nearly
twenty
years
shows
deterioration
and
professor
shurman
of
nebraska
thinks
it
now
worse
than
at
any
time
for
forty
years
we
are
in
the
case
of
many
christians
described
by
dante
who
strove
by
prayers
to
get
nearer
to
god
when
in
fact
with
every
petition
they
were
departing
farther
from
him
such
a
comprehensive
fact
must
have
many
causes
i
one
of
these
is
the
excessive
time
given
to
other
languages
just
at
the
psychological
period
of
greatest
linguistic
plasticity
and
capacity
for
growth
school
invention
and
tradition
is
so
inveterate
that
it
is
hard
for
us
to
understand
that
there
is
little
educational
value
and
perhaps
it
is
deëducational
to
learn
to
tell
the
time
of
day
or
name
a
spade
in
several
different
tongues
or
to
learn
to
say
the
lord
prayer
in
many
different
languages
any
one
of
which
the
lord
only
can
understand
the
polyglot
people
that
one
meets
on
great
international
highways
of
travel
are
linguists
only
in
the
sense
that
the
moke
on
the
variety
stage
who
plays
a
dozen
instruments
equally
badly
is
a
musician
it
is
a
psychological
impossibility
to
pass
through
the
apprenticeship
stage
of
learning
foreign
languages
at
the
age
when
the
vernacular
is
setting
without
crippling
it
the
extremes
are
the
youth
in
ancient
greece
studying
his
own
language
only
and
the
modern
high
school
boy
and
girl
dabbling
in
three
or
perhaps
four
languages
latin
which
in
the
eight
years
preceding
increased
one
hundred
and
per
cent
in
american
high
schools
while
the
proportion
entering
college
in
the
country
and
even
in
massachusetts
steadily
declined
is
the
chief
offender
in
the
day
of
its
pedagogical
glory
latin
was
the
universal
tongue
of
the
learned
sturm
idea
was
to
train
boys
so
that
if
suddenly
transported
to
ancient
rome
or
greece
they
would
be
at
home
there
language
it
was
said
was
the
chief
instrument
of
culture
latin
the
chief
language
and
therefore
a
better
drill
in
the
vernacular
than
the
vernacular
itself
its
rules
were
wholesome
swathing
bands
for
the
modern
languages
when
in
their
infancy
boys
must
speak
only
latin
on
the
playground
they
thought
felt
and
developed
an
intellectual
life
in
and
with
that
tongue
but
how
changed
all
this
is
now
statistical
studies
show
that
five
hours
a
week
for
a
year
gives
command
of
but
a
few
hundred
words
that
two
years
does
not
double
this
number
and
that
command
of
the
language
and
its
resources
in
the
original
is
almost
never
attained
but
that
it
is
abandoned
not
only
by
the
increasing
percentage
that
do
not
go
to
college
but
also
by
the
increasing
percentage
who
drop
it
forever
at
the
college
door
its
enormous
numerical
increase
due
to
high
school
requirements
the
increasing
percentage
of
girl
pupils
more
ready
to
follow
the
teacher
advice
in
connection
with
the
deteriorating
quality
of
the
girls
inevitable
with
their
increasing
numbers
the
sense
that
latin
means
entering
upon
a
higher
education
the
special
reverence
for
it
by
catholic
children
the
overcrowded
market
for
latin
teachers
whom
a
recent
writer
says
can
be
procured
by
the
score
at
less
rates
than
in
almost
any
other
subject
the
modern
methods
of
teaching
it
which
work
well
with
less
knowledge
of
it
by
the
teacher
than
in
the
case
of
other
school
topics
have
been
attended
perhaps
inevitably
by
steady
pedagogic
decline
despite
the
vaunted
new
methods
until
now
the
baby
latin
in
the
average
high
school
class
is
a
kind
of
sanctified
relic
a
ghost
of
a
ghost
suggesting
swift
struldbrugs
doomed
to
physical
immortality
but
shriveling
and
with
increasing
horror
of
all
things
new
in
the
german
emperor
declared
it
a
shame
for
a
boy
to
excel
in
latin
composition
and
in
the
high
schools
of
sweden
and
norway
it
has
been
practically
abandoned
in
the
present
stage
of
its
educational
decadence
the
power
of
the
dead
hand
is
strongly
illustrated
by
the
new
installation
of
the
old
roman
pronunciation
with
which
our
tongue
has
only
remote
analogies
which
makes
havoc
with
proper
names
which
is
unknown
and
unrecognized
in
the
schools
of
the
european
continent
and
which
makes
a
pedantic
affectation
out
of
more
vocalism
i
do
not
know
nor
care
whether
the
old
romans
pronounced
thus
or
not
but
if
historic
fidelity
in
this
sense
has
pedagogic
justification
why
still
teach
a
text
like
the
which
is
not
a
classic
but
a
modern
pedagogue
composition
i
believe
profoundly
in
the
latin
both
as
a
university
specialty
and
for
all
students
who
even
approach
mastery
but
for
the
vast
numbers
who
stop
in
the
early
stages
of
proficiency
it
is
disastrous
to
the
vernacular
compare
the
evils
of
translation
english
which
not
even
the
most
competent
and
laborious
teaching
can
wholly
prevent
and
which
careless
mechanical
instruction
directly
fosters
with
the
vigorous
fresh
productions
of
a
boy
or
girl
writing
or
speaking
of
something
of
vital
present
interest
the
psychology
of
translation
shows
that
it
gives
the
novice
a
consciousness
of
etymologies
which
rather
impedes
than
helps
the
free
movement
of
the
mind
jowett
said
in
substance
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
render
either
of
the
great
dead
languages
into
english
without
compromise
and
this
tends
to
injure
the
idiomatic
mastery
of
one
own
tongue
which
can
be
got
only
by
much
hard
experience
in
uttering
our
own
thoughts
before
trying
to
shape
the
dead
thoughts
of
others
into
our
language
we
confound
the
little
knowledge
of
which
latin
gives
with
the
far
higher
and
subtler
which
makes
the
soul
of
one
language
so
different
from
that
of
another
and
training
in
which
ought
not
to
end
until
one
has
become
more
or
less
of
a
stylist
and
knows
how
to
hew
out
modes
of
expressing
his
own
individuality
in
great
language
there
is
a
sense
in
which
macaulay
was
not
an
englishman
at
all
but
a
ciceronian
latinist
who
foisted
an
alien
style
upon
our
tongue
and
even
addison
is
a
foreigner
compared
to
the
virile
kipling
the
nature
and
needs
of
the
adolescent
mind
demand
bread
and
meat
while
latin
rudiments
are
husks
in
his
autobiography
booker
washington
says
that
for
ten
years
after
their
emancipation
the
two
chief
ambitions
of
the
young
negro
of
the
south
were
to
hold
office
and
to
study
latin
and
he
adds
that
the
chief
endeavor
of
his
life
has
been
against
these
tendencies
for
the
american
boy
and
girl
high
school
too
often
means
latin
this
gives
at
first
a
pleasing
sense
of
exaltation
to
a
higher
stage
of
life
but
after
from
one
to
three
years
the
great
majority
who
enter
the
high
school
drop
out
limp
and
discouraged
for
many
reasons
largely
however
because
they
are
not
fed
defective
nutrition
of
the
mind
also
causes
a
restlessness
which
enhances
all
the
influences
which
make
boys
and
girls
leave
school
ii
the
second
cause
of
this
degeneration
is
the
subordination
of
literature
and
content
to
language
study
grammar
arises
in
the
old
age
of
language
as
once
applied
to
our
relatively
grammarless
tongue
it
always
was
more
or
less
of
a
artifact
and
an
alien
yoke
and
has
become
increasingly
so
as
english
has
grown
great
and
free
its
ghost
in
the
many
textbooks
devoted
to
it
lacks
just
the
quality
of
logic
which
made
and
besouled
it
philology
too
with
all
its
magnificence
is
not
a
product
of
the
nascent
stages
of
speech
in
the
college
which
is
its
stronghold
it
has
so
inspired
professors
of
english
that
their
ideal
is
to
be
critical
rather
than
creative
till
they
prefer
the
minute
reading
of
a
few
masterpieces
to
a
wide
general
knowledge
and
a
typical
university
announces
that
in
every
case
the
examiners
will
treat
mere
knowledge
of
books
as
less
important
than
the
ability
to
write
good
english
that
will
parse
and
that
is
spelled
punctuated
capitalized
and
paragraphed
aright
good
professors
of
english
literature
are
hard
to
find
and
upon
them
philologists
who
are
plentiful
look
with
a
certain
condescension
many
academic
chairs
of
english
are
filled
by
men
whose
acquaintance
of
our
literature
is
very
narrow
who
wish
to
be
linguistic
and
not
literary
and
this
is
true
even
in
ancient
tongues
at
a
brilliant
examination
a
candidate
for
the
doctor
degree
who
had
answered
many
questions
concerning
the
forms
of
lucretius
when
asked
whether
he
was
a
dramatist
historian
poet
or
philosopher
did
not
know
and
his
professor
deemed
the
question
improper
i
visited
the
eleventh
recitation
in
othello
in
a
high
school
class
of
nineteen
pupils
not
one
of
whom
knew
how
the
story
ended
so
intent
had
they
been
kept
on
its
verbiage
hence
too
has
come
the
twelve
feet
of
on
english
on
my
shelves
with
many
standard
works
edited
for
schools
with
more
notes
than
text
fashion
that
works
from
above
down
the
grades
and
college
entrance
requirements
are
in
large
measure
responsible
for
this
perhaps
now
the
worst
case
of
the
prostitution
of
content
to
form
long
exposure
to
this
method
of
linguistic
manicuring
tends
to
make
students
who
try
to
write
seeking
an
elaboration
of
petty
trifles
as
if
the
less
the
content
the
greater
the
triumph
of
form
alone
could
be
these
petty
but
pretty
nothings
are
like
german
confectionery
that
appeals
to
the
eye
but
has
little
for
taste
and
is
worse
than
nothing
for
the
digestion
it
is
like
straining
work
on
an
empty
stomach
for
youth
this
embroidery
of
details
is
the
precocious
senescence
that
nordau
has
so
copiously
illustrated
as
literary
decadence
language
is
vastly
larger
than
all
its
content
and
the
way
to
teach
it
is
to
focus
the
mind
upon
story
history
oratory
drama
bible
for
their
esthetic
mental
and
above
all
moral
content
as
shown
in
the
last
chapter
the
more
unconscious
processes
that
reflect
imitatively
the
linguistic
environment
and
that
strike
out
intuitively
oral
and
written
vents
for
interests
so
intense
that
they
must
be
told
and
shared
are
what
teach
us
how
to
command
the
resources
of
our
mother
tongue
these
prescriptions
and
corrections
and
consciousness
of
the
manifold
ways
of
error
are
never
so
peculiarly
liable
to
hinder
rather
than
to
help
as
in
early
adolescence
when
the
soul
has
a
new
content
and
a
new
sense
for
it
and
so
abhors
and
is
so
incapable
of
precision
and
propriety
of
diction
to
hold
up
the
flights
of
exuberant
youth
by
forever
being
on
the
hunt
for
errors
is
to
borrow
the
language
of
the
gridiron
low
tackle
and
i
would
rather
be
convicted
of
many
errors
by
such
methods
than
use
them
of
course
this
has
its
place
but
it
must
always
be
subordinated
to
a
larger
view
as
in
one
of
the
newly
discovered
ascribed
to
jesus
who
when
he
found
a
man
gathering
sticks
on
sunday
said
to
him
if
you
understand
what
you
are
doing
it
is
well
but
if
not
thou
shalt
be
damned
the
great
teacher
who
when
asked
how
he
obtained
such
rare
results
in
expression
answered
by
carefully
neglecting
it
and
seeking
utter
absorption
in
was
also
a
good
practical
psychologist
this
is
the
inveterate
tendency
that
in
other
ages
has
made
pedagogic
scribes
talmudists
epigoni
and
sophists
who
have
magnified
the
letter
and
lost
the
spirit
but
there
are
yet
other
seats
of
difficulty
iii
it
is
hard
and
in
the
history
of
the
race
a
late
change
to
receive
language
through
the
eye
which
reads
instead
of
through
the
ear
which
hears
not
only
is
perception
measurably
quite
distinctly
slower
but
book
language
is
related
to
oral
speech
somewhat
as
an
herbarium
is
to
a
garden
or
a
museum
of
stuffed
specimens
to
a
menagerie
the
invention
of
letters
is
a
novelty
in
the
history
of
the
race
that
spoke
for
countless
ages
before
it
wrote
the
winged
word
of
mouth
is
saturated
with
color
perhaps
hot
with
feeling
musical
with
inflection
is
the
utterance
of
a
living
present
personality
the
consummation
of
man
gregarious
instincts
the
book
is
dead
and
more
or
less
impersonal
best
apprehended
in
solitude
its
matter
more
intellectualized
it
deals
in
remoter
knowledge
so
that
plato
reproached
aristotle
as
being
a
reader
one
remove
from
the
first
spontaneous
source
of
original
impressions
and
ideas
and
the
doughty
medieval
knights
scorned
reading
as
a
mere
clerk
trick
not
wishing
to
muddle
their
wits
with
other
people
ideas
when
their
own
were
good
enough
for
them
but
although
some
of
the
great
men
in
history
could
not
read
and
though
some
of
the
illiterate
were
often
morally
and
intellectually
above
some
of
the
literate
the
argument
here
is
that
the
printed
page
must
not
be
too
suddenly
or
too
early
thrust
between
the
child
and
life
the
plea
is
for
moral
and
objective
work
more
stories
narratives
and
even
vivid
readings
as
is
now
done
statedly
in
more
than
a
dozen
of
the
public
libraries
of
the
country
not
so
often
by
teachers
as
by
librarians
all
to
the
end
that
the
ear
the
chief
receptacle
of
language
be
maintained
in
its
dominance
that
the
fine
sense
of
sound
rhythm
cadence
pronunciation
and
generally
be
not
atrophied
that
the
eye
which
normally
ranges
freely
from
far
to
near
be
not
injured
by
the
confined
treadmill
and
zigzag
of
the
printed
page
closely
connected
with
this
and
perhaps
psychologically
worse
is
the
substitution
of
the
pen
and
the
scribbling
fingers
for
the
mouth
and
tongue
speech
is
directly
to
and
from
the
soul
writing
the
deliberation
of
which
fits
age
better
than
youth
slows
down
its
impetuosity
many
fold
and
is
in
every
way
farther
removed
from
vocal
utterance
than
is
the
eye
from
the
ear
never
have
there
been
so
many
pounds
of
paper
so
many
pencils
and
such
excessive
scribbling
as
in
the
calamopapyrus
pedagogy
of
and
in
this
country
not
only
has
the
daily
theme
spread
as
infection
but
the
daily
lesson
is
now
extracted
through
the
point
of
a
pencil
instead
of
from
the
mouth
the
tongue
rests
and
the
curve
of
writer
cramp
takes
a
sharp
turn
upward
as
if
we
were
making
scribes
reporters
and
in
some
schools
teachers
seem
to
be
conducting
correspondence
classes
with
their
own
pupils
it
all
makes
excellent
busy
work
keeps
the
pupils
quiet
and
orderly
and
allows
the
school
output
to
be
quantified
and
some
of
it
gives
time
for
more
care
in
the
choice
of
words
but
is
it
a
gain
to
substitute
a
letter
for
a
visit
to
try
to
give
written
precedence
over
spoken
forms
here
again
we
violate
the
great
law
that
the
child
repeats
the
history
of
the
race
and
that
from
the
larger
historic
standpoint
writing
as
a
mode
of
utterance
is
only
the
latest
fashion
of
course
the
pupils
must
write
and
write
well
just
as
they
must
read
and
read
much
but
that
english
suffers
from
insisting
upon
this
double
long
circuit
too
early
and
cultivates
it
to
excess
devitalizes
school
language
and
makes
it
a
little
unreal
like
other
affectations
of
adult
ways
so
that
on
escaping
from
its
thraldom
the
child
and
youth
slump
back
to
the
language
of
the
street
as
never
before
this
is
a
false
application
of
the
principle
of
learning
to
do
by
doing
the
young
do
not
learn
to
write
by
writing
but
by
reading
and
hearing
to
become
a
good
writer
one
must
read
feel
think
experience
until
he
has
something
to
say
that
others
want
to
hear
the
golden
age
of
french
literature
as
gaston
deschamps
and
brunetière
have
lately
told
us
was
that
of
the
salon
when
conversation
dominated
letters
set
fashions
and
made
the
charm
of
french
style
its
lowest
ebb
was
when
bookishness
led
and
people
began
to
talk
as
they
wrote
iv
the
fourth
cause
of
degeneration
of
school
english
is
the
growing
preponderance
of
concrete
words
for
designating
things
of
sense
and
physical
acts
over
the
higher
element
of
language
that
names
and
deals
with
concepts
ideas
and
things
the
came
in
as
a
reaction
against
the
danger
of
merely
verbal
and
definition
knowledge
and
word
memory
now
it
has
gone
so
far
that
not
only
things
but
even
languages
vernacular
and
foreign
are
taught
by
appeals
to
the
eye
more
lately
elementary
science
has
introduced
another
area
of
pictures
and
things
while
industrial
education
has
still
further
greatly
enlarged
the
material
element
of
training
geography
is
taught
with
artifacts
globes
maps
sand
boxes
drawing
miss
margaret
smith
counted
two
hundred
and
eighty
objects
that
must
be
distributed
and
gathered
for
forty
pupils
in
a
single
art
lesson
instruction
moreover
is
more
and
more
busied
upon
parts
and
details
rather
than
wholes
upon
analysis
rather
than
synthesis
thus
in
modern
pedagogy
there
is
an
increased
tyranny
of
things
a
growing
neglect
or
exclusion
of
all
that
is
unseen
the
first
result
of
this
is
that
the
modern
school
child
is
more
and
more
mentally
helpless
without
objects
of
sense
conversation
is
increasingly
concrete
if
not
of
material
things
and
persons
present
in
time
and
even
place
instead
of
dealing
with
thoughts
and
ideas
speech
and
writing
is
close
to
sense
and
the
words
used
are
names
for
images
and
acts
but
there
is
another
higher
part
of
language
that
is
not
so
abjectly
tied
down
to
perception
but
that
lives
moves
and
has
its
being
in
the
field
of
concepts
rather
than
percepts
which
to
use
earle
distinction
is
symbolic
and
not
presentative
that
describes
thinking
that
is
not
mere
contiguity
in
space
or
sequence
in
time
but
that
is
best
in
the
far
higher
and
more
mental
associations
of
likeness
that
is
more
remote
from
activity
that
to
use
logical
terminology
is
connotative
and
not
merely
denotative
that
has
extension
as
well
as
intension
that
requires
abstraction
and
generalization
without
this
latter
element
higher
mental
development
is
lacking
because
this
means
more
than
the
material
world
our
school
youth
today
suffer
from
just
this
defect
if
their
psychic
operations
can
be
called
thought
it
is
of
that
elementary
and
half
animal
kind
that
consists
imagery
their
talk
with
each
other
is
of
things
of
present
and
immediate
interest
they
lack
even
the
elements
of
imagination
which
makes
new
combinations
and
is
creative
because
they
are
dominated
by
mental
pictures
of
the
sensory
large
views
that
take
them
afield
away
from
the
persons
and
things
and
acts
they
know
do
not
appeal
to
them
attempts
to
think
rigorously
are
too
hard
the
teacher
feels
that
all
the
content
of
mind
must
come
in
through
the
senses
and
that
if
these
are
well
fed
inferences
and
generalizations
will
come
of
themselves
later
many
pupils
have
never
in
their
lives
talked
five
minutes
before
others
on
any
subject
whatever
that
can
properly
be
called
intellectual
it
irks
them
to
occupy
themselves
with
purely
mental
processes
so
enslaved
are
they
by
what
is
near
and
personal
and
thus
they
are
impoverished
in
the
best
elements
of
language
it
is
as
if
what
are
sometimes
called
the
associative
fibers
both
ends
of
which
are
in
the
brain
were
dwarfed
in
comparison
with
the
afferent
and
efferent
fibers
that
mediate
sense
and
motion
that
the
soul
of
language
as
an
instrument
of
thought
consists
in
this
element
so
often
lacking
is
conclusively
shown
in
the
facts
of
speech
diseases
in
the
slowly
progressive
aphasias
of
late
so
carefully
studied
the
words
first
lost
are
those
of
things
and
acts
most
familiar
to
the
patient
while
the
words
that
persist
longest
in
the
wreckage
of
the
are
generally
words
that
do
not
designate
the
things
of
sense
a
tailor
loses
the
power
to
name
his
chalk
measure
shears
although
he
can
long
talk
fluently
of
what
little
he
may
chance
to
know
of
god
beauty
truth
virtue
happiness
prosperity
etc
the
farmer
is
unable
to
name
the
cattle
in
his
yard
or
his
own
occupations
although
he
can
reason
as
well
as
ever
about
politics
can
not
discuss
coin
or
bills
but
can
talk
of
financial
policies
and
securities
or
about
health
and
wealth
generally
the
reason
obvious
it
is
because
concrete
thinking
has
two
forms
the
word
and
the
image
and
the
latter
so
tends
to
take
the
place
of
the
former
that
it
can
be
lost
to
both
sense
and
articulation
without
great
impairment
whereas
conceptual
thinking
lacks
imagery
and
depends
upon
words
alone
and
hence
these
must
persist
because
they
have
no
alternate
form
which
vicariates
for
them
in
its
lower
stages
speech
is
necessarily
closely
bound
up
with
the
concrete
world
but
its
real
glory
appears
in
its
later
stages
and
its
higher
forms
because
there
the
soul
takes
flight
in
the
intellectual
world
learns
to
live
amidst
its
more
spiritual
realities
to
put
names
to
thoughts
which
is
far
higher
than
to
put
names
to
things
it
is
in
this
world
that
the
best
things
in
the
best
books
live
and
the
modern
distaste
for
them
the
mental
action
that
hovers
near
the
coastline
of
matter
and
can
not
launch
out
with
zest
into
the
open
sea
of
thoughts
holding
communion
with
the
great
dead
of
the
past
or
the
great
living
of
the
distant
present
seems
almost
like
a
slow
progressive
abandonment
of
the
high
attribute
of
speech
and
the
lapse
toward
infantile
or
animal
if
the
school
is
slowly
becoming
speechless
in
this
sense
if
it
is
lapsing
in
all
departments
toward
busy
work
and
losing
silence
repose
the
power
of
logical
thought
and
even
that
of
meditation
which
is
the
muse
of
originality
this
is
perhaps
the
gravest
of
all
these
types
of
decay
if
the
child
has
no
resources
in
solitude
can
not
think
without
the
visual
provocation
is
losing
subjective
life
enthusiasm
for
public
social
ethical
questions
is
crippled
for
intellectual
pursuits
cares
only
in
a
languid
way
for
literary
prose
and
poetry
responds
only
to
sensuous
stimuli
and
events
at
short
range
and
is
indifferent
to
all
wide
relations
and
moral
responsibility
cares
only
for
commercial
the
tactics
of
field
sport
laboratory
occupations
and
things
which
call
be
illustrated
from
a
pedagogic
museum
then
the
school
is
dwarfing
in
dawning
maturity
the
higher
powers
that
belong
to
this
stage
of
development
and
is
responsible
for
mental
arrest
in
this
deplorable
condition
if
we
turn
to
the
child
study
of
speech
for
help
we
find
that
although
it
has
been
chiefly
occupied
with
infant
vocabularies
there
are
already
a
very
few
and
confessedly
crude
and
feeble
beginnings
but
even
these
shed
more
light
on
the
lost
pathway
than
all
other
sources
combined
the
child
once
set
in
their
midst
again
corrects
the
wise
men
we
will
first
briefly
recapitulate
these
and
then
state
and
apply
their
lessons

this
writer
says
that
adolescence
is
marked
by
some
increased
love
of
words
for
motor
activity
and
in
interest
in
words
as
things
in
themselves
but
shows
a
still
greater
rise
of
interest
in
new
words
and
pronunciations
above
all
there
is
a
tremendous
rise
in
interest
in
words
as
instruments
of
thought
the
flood
of
new
experiences
feelings
and
views
finds
the
old
vocabulary
inadequate
hence
the
dumb

feeling

which
most
adolescents
at
one
time
or
another
complain
and
also

suspect
from
this
study
in

case
of

we
have
an
explanation
of
the
rise
of
interest

the

the
tremendous

miss

confessed
as

both
attractive
and

from

it
appears
that
early
adolescence
is
the
curve
of
greatest
pleasure
in
its
use
fourteen
being
the

there
is
very

the

for

rises
very
rapidly

nearly

from

out
of

so
despite

conradi
who
collected
and
prints
a
long
list
of
current
slang
words
and
phrases
found
that
of
young
boys
and

not

failed

constructs
the

comparing
with
this
the
curve
of
a
craze
for
reading
and
for
precision
in

the
reasons
given
are
in
order
of
frequency
that
slang
was
more
emphatic
more
exact
more
concise
convenient
sounded
pretty
relieved
formality
was
natural
manly
appropriate

only
a
very
few
thought
it
was
vulgar
limited
the

led
to
or
was
a
substitute
for

destroyed
exactness
etc
this
writer
attempts
a
provisional
classification
of
slang
expressions
under
the
suggestive
heads
of
rebukes
to
pride
boasting
and
loquacity
hypocrisy
quaint
and
emphatic
negatives
exaggerations
exclamations
mild
oaths
attending
to
one

names

absurdity
neurotic

slang
is
also
rich
in
describing
conflicts
of
all
kinds
praising
courage
censuring
inquisitiveness
and
as
a
school
of
moral
discipline
but
he
finds
however
a
very
large
number
unclassified
and
while
he
maintains
throughout
a
distinction
between
that

by

and
by

differences
are
not
very
marked
the
great
majority
of
terms
are
mentioned
but
once
and
a
few
under
nearly
all
of
the
above
heads
have
great
numerical
precedence
a
somewhat
striking
fact
is
the
manifold
variations
of
a

typical

feeling
is
so
intense
and
massive
and
psychic
processes
are
so
rapid
forcible
and
undeveloped
that
the
pithiness
of
some
of
those
expressions
makes
them
brilliant
and
creative
works
of
genius
and
after
securing
an
apprenticeship
are
sure
of
adoption
their
very
lawlessness
helps
to
keep
speech
from
rigidity
and
desiccation
and
they
hit
off
nearly
every
essential
phrase
of
adolescent
life
and
experience
conventional
modes
of
speech
do
not
satisfy
the
adolescent
so
that
he
is
often
either
reticent
or
slangy
walt
whitman
says
that
slang
is
an
attempt
of
common
humanity
to
escape
from
bald
literalism
and
to
express
itself
illimitably
which
in
the
highest
walks
produces
poets
and
poems
and
again
daring
as
it
is
to
say
so
in
the
growth
of
language
it
is
certain
that
the
retrospect
of
slang
from
the
start
would
be
the
recalling
from
their
nebulous
condition
of
all
that
is
poetical
in
the
stores
of
human
utterance
lowell
says
there
is
death
in
the
dictionary
and
where
language
is
too
strictly
limited
by
convention
the
ground
for
expression
to
grow
in
is
limited
also
and
we
get
a
potted
literature
chinese
dwarfs
instead
of
healthy
trees
lounsbury
asserts
that
slang
is
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
users
of
language
to
say
something
more
vividly
strongly
concisely
than
the
language
existing
permits
it
to
be
said
it
is
the
source
from
which
the
decaying
energies
of
speech
are
constantly
refreshed
conradi
adds
in
substance
that
weak
or
vicious
slang
is
too
feeble
to
survive
and
what
is
vital
enough
to
live
fills
a
need
the
final
authority
is
the
people
and
it
is
better
to
teach
youth
to
discriminate
between
good
and
bad
slang
rather
than
to
forbid
it
entirely
emerson
calls
it
language
in
the
making
its
crude
vital
material
it
is
often
an
effective
school
of
moral
description
a
palliative
for
profanity
and
expresses
the
natural
craving
for
superlatives
faults
are
hit
off
and
condemned
with
the
curtness
sententiousness
of
proverbs
devised
by
youth
to
sanctify
itself
and
correct
its
own
faults
the
pedagogue
objects
that
it
violates
good
form
and
established
usage
but
why
should
the
habits
of
hundreds
of
years
ago
control
when
they
can
not
satisfy
the
needs
of
youth
which
requires
a
of
its
own
often
called
slanguage
most
high
school
and
college
youth
of
both
sexes
have
two
distinct
styles
that
of
the
classroom
which
is
as
unnatural
as
the
etiquette
of
a
royal
reception
or
a
formal
call
and
the
other
that
of
their
own
breezy
free
natural
life
often
these
two
have
no
relation
to
or
effect
upon
each
other
and
often
the
latter
is
at
times
put
by
with
good
resolves
to
speak
as
purely
and
therefore
as
as
they
knew
with
petty
fines
for
every
slang
expression
but
very
few
and
these
generally
husky
boys
boldly
try
to
assert
their
own
rude
but
vigorous
vernacular
in
the
field
of
school
requirements
these
simple
studies
in
this
vast
field
demonstrate
little
or
nothing
but
they
suggest
very
much
slang
commonly
expresses
a
moral
judgment
and
falls
into
ethical
categories
it
usually
concerns
ideas
sentiment
and
will
has
a
psychic
content
and
is
never
like
the
language
of
the
school
a
mere
picture
of
objects
of
sense
or
a
description
of
acts
to
restate
it
in
correct
english
would
be
a
course
in
ethics
courtesy
taste
logical
predication
and
opposition
honesty
modesty
and
just
the
ideal
and
mental
content
that
youth
most
needs
and
which
the
sensuous
presentation
methods
of
teaching
have
neglected
those
who
see
in
speech
nothing
but
form
condemn
it
because
it
is
vulgar
youth
has
been
left
to
meet
these
high
needs
alone
and
the
prevalence
of
these
crude
forms
is
an
indictment
of
the
delinquency
of
pedagogues
in
not
teaching
their
pupils
to
develop
and
use
their
intellect
properly
their
pith
and
meatiness
are
a
standing
illustration
of
the
need
of
condensation
for
intellectual
objects
that
later
growth
analyzes
these
expressions
also
illustrate
the
law
that
the
higher
and
larger
the
spiritual
content
the
grosser
must
be
the
illustration
in
which
it
is
first
couched
further
studies
now
in
progress
will
i
believe
make
this
still
clearer
again
we
see
in
the
above
outcrops
of
the
strong
pubescent
instinct
to
enlarge
the
vocabulary
in
two
ways
one
is
to
affect
foreign
equivalents
this
at
first
suggests
an
appetency
for
another
language
like
the
gibberish
of
children
it
is
one
of
the
motives
that
prompts
many
to
study
latin
or
french
but
it
has
little
depth
for
it
turns
out
on
closer
study
to
be
only
the
affectation
of
superiority
and
the
love
of
mystifying
others
the
other
is
a
very
different
impulse
to
widen
the
vernacular
to
pause
to
learn
several
foreign
equivalents
of
things
of
sense
may
be
if
it
limits
the
expansion
of
thought
in
our
own
tongue
the
two
are
in
fact
often
inversely
related
to
each
other
in
giving
a
foreign
synonym
when
the
mind
seeks
a
new
native
word
the
pedagogue
does
not
deal
fairly
in
this
irradiation
into
the
mother
tongue
sometimes
experience
with
the
sentiment
or
feeling
act
fact
or
object
precedes
and
then
a
name
for
it
is
demanded
or
conversely
the
sound
size
oddness
or
jingle
of
the
word
is
first
attractive
and
the
meaning
comes
later
the
latter
needs
the
recognition
and
utilization
which
the
former
already
has
lists
of
favorite
words
should
be
wrought
out
for
spelling
and
writing
and
their
meanings
illustrated
for
these
have
often
the
charm
of
novelty
as
on
the
frontier
of
knowledge
and
enlarge
the
mental
horizon
like
new
discoveries
we
must
not
starve
this
voracious
new
appetite
for
words
as
instruments
of
thought
interest
in
rises
till
twelve
or
thirteen
and
thereafter
falls
off
perhaps
rather
suddenly
partly
because
youth
is
now
more
interested
in
receiving
than
in
giving
as
in
the
drawing
curve
we
saw
a
characteristic
age
when
the
child
loses
pleasure
in
creating
as
its
power
of
appreciating
pictures
rapidly
arises
so
now
as
the
reading
curve
rises
auditory
receptivity
makes
way
for
the
visual
method
shown
in
the
rise
of
the
reading
curve
with
augmented
zest
for
of
acquisition
darkness
or
twilight
enhances
the
story
interest
in
children
for
it
eliminates
the
distraction
of
sense
and
encourages
the
imagination
to
unfold
its
pinions
but
the
youthful
fancy
is
less
and
can
take
its
boldest
flights
in
broad
daylight
a
or
an
open
hearth
with
tales
of
animals
ghosts
heroism
and
adventure
can
teach
virtue
and
vocabulary
style
and
substance
in
their
native
unity
the
pubescent
reading
passion
is
partly
the
cause
and
partly
an
effect
of
the
new
zest
in
and
docility
to
the
adult
world
and
also
of
the
fact
that
the
receptive
are
now
and
here
so
immeasurably
in
advance
of
the
creative
powers
now
the
individual
transcends
his
own
experience
and
learns
to
profit
by
that
of
others
there
is
now
evolved
a
penumbral
region
in
the
soul
more
or
less
beyond
the
reach
of
all
school
methods
a
world
of
glimpses
and
hints
and
the
work
here
is
that
of
the
prospector
and
not
of
the
careful
miner
it
is
the
age
of
skipping
and
sampling
of
pressing
the
keys
lightly
what
is
acquired
is
not
examinable
but
only
suggestive
perhaps
nothing
read
now
fails
to
leave
its
mark
it
can
not
be
orally
reproduced
at
call
but
on
emergency
it
is
at
hand
for
use
as
augustine
said
of
god
so
the
child
might
say
of
most
of
his
mental
content
in
these
psychic
areas
if
you
ask
me
i
do
not
know
but
if
you
do
not
ask
me
i
know
very
well
a
case
analogous
to
the
typical
girl
who
exclaimed
to
her
teacher
i
can
do
and
understand
this
perfectly
if
you
only
explain
it
that
is
why
examinations
in
english
if
not
impossible
as
goldwin
smith
and
oxford
hold
are
very
liable
to
be
harmful
and
recitations
and
critical
notes
an
impertinence
and
always
in
danger
of
causing
arrest
of
this
exquisite
romantic
function
in
which
literature
comes
in
the
closest
relation
to
life
keeping
the
heart
warm
reënforcing
all
its
good
motives
preforming
choices
and
universalizing
its
sympathies
bullock

from
from
the
third
to
the
twelfth
grade
both
inclusive
concerning
their
reading
from
this
it
appeared
that
the
average
boy
of
the
third
grade
read
books
in
six
months
that
the
average
falls
to
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
grades
and
rises
to
a
maximum
of
at
the
seventh
grade
then
drops
quite
regularly
to
in
the
twelfth
grade
at
the
end
of

course
the
independent
tabulation
of

from
other
cities
showed
little
variation
grade
for
grade
the
girls
read
more
than
the
boys
and
as
a
rule
they
reach
their
maximum
a
year
sooner
and
from
a
general
maximum
of
books
there
is
a
drop
to
at
the
end
of
the
course
the
age
of
reading
may
be
postponed
or
accelerated
perhaps
nearly
a
year
by
the
absence
or
presence
of
library
facilities
tabulating
the
short
stories
read
per
week
it
was
found
that
these
averaged
in
the
third
grade
rose
to
per

in
the
seventh
grade
and
in
the
twelfth

fallen

stories
seem

with

and
that
liking
seems
well
marked

eighth

stories
of
adventure
are
popular
all
through
the
heroic
period
reaching
their
maximum
in
the
eighth
and
ninth

the
liking
for
biography
and
travel
or
exploration
grows
gradually
to
a
climax
in
the
ninth
grade
and
remains
well
up
through
the
course
the
tender
sentiment
has
little
charm
for
the
average
grade
boy
and
only
in
the
high
school
course
does
he
acknowledge
any
considerable
use
of
love
stories
in
the
sixth
grade
he
is
fond
of
detective
stories
but
they
lose
their
charm
for
him
as
he
grows
older
for
girls
stories
of
adventure
are
popular
in
the
sixth
grade
and
stories
of
travel
are
always
enjoyed
the
girl
likes
biography
but
in
the
high
school
true
to
her
sex
she
prefers
stories
of
great
women
rather
than
great
men
but
because
she
can
not
get
them
reads
those
of
men
pity
it
is
that
the
biographies
of
so
few
of
the
world
many
great
women
are
written
the
taste
for
love
stories
increases
steadily
to
the
end
of
the
high
school
course
beyond
that
we
have
no
record
thus
the
maximum
amount
of
reading
is
done
in
every
instance
between
the
sixth
and
eighth
grades
the
average
being
in
the
seventh
grade
at
an
average
age
of
fourteen
and
years
per
cent
of
all
discuss
their
reading
with
some
one
and
the
writer
urges
that
when
per
cent
of
the
boys
prefer
adventure
or
per
cent
of
the
girls
prefer
love
stories
that
is
what
they
are
going
to
read
and
the
duty
of
the
teacher
or
librarian
is
to
see
that
they
have
both
in
the
highest
purest
form
henderson
found
that
of
children
from
nine
to
fifteen
least
books
were
read
at
the
age
of
nine
and
most
at
the
age
of
fifteen
and
that
there
was
a
gradual
rise
in
amount
throughout
the
only
break
being
in
the
case
of
girls
at
the
age
of
fourteen
and
the
boys
at
the
age
of
twelve
for
fiction
the
mark
was
reached
for
both
sexes
at
eleven
and
the
subsequent
fall
is
far
less
rapid
for
girls
than
for
boys
at
the
age
of
thirteen
the
record
for
travel
and
adventure
stands
highest
in
the
case
of
the
boys
phenomenally
so
there
is
a
gradual
rise
in
history
with
age
and
a
corresponding
decline
in
fiction

a
sudden
increase
in
the
sixth
grade
when
children
are
about
twelve
when
there
is
often
a
veritable
reading
craze
dolls
are
abandoned
and
plays
games
and
companionship
of
others
are
less
attractive
and
the
reading
hunger
in
many
children
becomes
insatiable
and
is
often
quite
indiscriminate
it
seems
to
most
frequently
begin
at
about
twelve
years
of
age
and
continue
at
least
three
or
four
years
after
which
increased
home
duties
social
responsibilities
and
school
requirements
reduce
it
and
make
it
more
discriminating
in
quality
the
fact
that
boys
read
about
twice
as
much
history
and
travel
as
girls
and
only
about
as
much
poetry
and
stories
shows
beyond
question
that
the
emotional
and
intellectual
wants
of
boys
and
girls
are
essentially
different
before
sexual
maturity
miss
vostrovsky
found
that
among
children
there
was
a
great
increase
of
taste
for
reading
as
shown
by
the
number
of
books
taken
from
the
library
which
began
with
a
sharp
rise
at
eleven
and
increased
steadily
to
nineteen
when
her
survey
ended
that
boys
read
most
till
seventeen
and
then
girls
took
the
precedence
the
taste
for
juvenile
stories
was
declining
and
that
for
fiction
and
general
literature
was
rapidly
increased
at
about
the
sixteenth
year
a
change
took
place
in
both
sexes
showing
then
the
beginning
of
a
greater
interest
in
works
of
a
more
general
character
girls
read
more
fiction
than
boys
at
every
age
but
the
interest
in
it
begins
to
be
very
decided
at
adolescence
with
girls
it
appears
to
come
a
little
earlier
and
with
greater
suddenness
while
the
juvenile
story
maintains
a
strong
hold
upon
boys
even
after
the
fifteenth
year
the
curve
of
decline
in
juvenile
stories
is
much
more
pronounced
in
both
sexes
than
the
rise
of
fiction
through
the
teens
there
is
a
great
increase
in
the
definiteness
of
answers
to
the
questions
why
books
were
chosen
instead
of
being
read
because
they
were
good
or
nice
they
were
read
because
recommended
and
later
because
of
some
special
interest
girls
relied
on
recommendations
more
than
boys
the
latter
were
more
guided
by
reason
the
former
by
sentiment
nearly
three
times
as
many
boys
in
the
early
teens
chose
books
because
they
were
exciting
or
venturesome
even
the
stories
which
girls
called
exciting
were
tame
compared
with
those
chosen
by
boys
girls
chose
books
more
than
four
times
as
often
because
of
children
in
them
and
more
often
because
they
ware
funny
boys
care
very
little
for
style
but
must
have
incidents
and
heroes
the
author
says
the
special
interest
that
girls
have
in
fiction
begins
about
the
age
of
adolescence
after
the
sixteenth
year
the
extreme
delight
in
stories
fades
or
school
demands
become
more
imperative
and
uniform
girls
prefer
domestic
stories
and
those
with
characters
like
themselves
and
scenes
like
those
with
which
they
are
familiar
no
boy
confesses
to
a
purely
girl
story
while
girls
frankly
do
to
an
interesting
story
about
boys
women
writers
seem
to
appeal
more
to
girls
men
writers
to
boys
hence
the
authors
named
by
each
sex
are
almost
entirely
different
in
fiction
more
standard
works
were
drawn
by
boys
than
by
girls
when
left
to
develop
according
to
chance
the
tendency
is
often
toward
a
selection
of
books
which
unfit
one
for
living
either
by
presenting
on
the
one
hand
too
many
scenes
of
delicious
excitement
or
on
the
other
by
narrowing
the
vision
to
the
wider
possibilities

lancaster
found
that
had
what
might
be
called
a
craze
for
reading
at
some
time
in
the
adolescent
period
and
thinks
parents
little
realize
the
intensity
of
the
desire
to
read
or
how
this
nascent
period
is
the
golden
age
to
cultivate
taste
and
inoculate
against

the
curve
rises
rapidly
from

to

culminates
at

for

of

from
the
fairy

of

childhood
to
the
travels

of

and
then
to

etc
and
some
give
the
order
of
their
development
of
taste
for
the
great
poets
the
careful
statistics
of
reyer
show
that
the
greatest
greed
of
reading
is
from
the
age
of
fifteen
to
and
is
on
the

greatest
of
all
at

that
ten

forty

the

ascends
very
rapidly
to
fall

yet
more
rapidly
as
the
need
of
becomes
imperative
after
the

the

and
rapidly

flood
of

is
to
turn
resolutely
away
from
the
ideal
of

to

of

while
literature
rescues

from
individual
limitations
and
enables
it
to
act
and
think
more
as
spectators
of
all
time
and
sharers
of
all
existence
the
passion
for
reading
may
be
excessive
and
books
which
from
the
silent
alcoves
of
our

american
libraries
rule
the

more
now
than

takes
its

it
of

the

frequent
motive
some

to

idle

to
appear
learned
or
to
acquire
a

for
developing
the

of

that
the
power

attained

school
pressure
should
not
suppress
this
instinct
of
omnivorous
reading
which
at
this
age
sometimes
prompts
the
resolve
to
read
encyclopedias
and
even
libraries
or
to
sample
everything
to
be
found
in
books
at
home
along
with
but
never
suppressing
it
there
should
be
some
stated
reading
but
this
should
lay
down
only
kinds
of
reading
like
the
four
emphasized
in

chapter
or
offer
a
goodly
number
of
large
alternative
groups
of
books
and
authors
like
the
five
of
the
leland
stanford
university
and
permit
wide
liberty
of

both

few
triumphs
of
the
uniformitarians
who
sacrifice
individual
needs
to
mechanical
convenience
in
dealing
with

in
masses
have
been
so
sad
as
marking
off
and
standardizing
a
definite
quantum
of
requirements
here
instead
of
irrigating
a
wide
field
the
of

forced
to
cut
a
deep
canyon
and
leave
wide
desert
plains
of
ignorance
on
either
side
besides
imitation
which
reads
what
others
do
is
the
desire
to
read
something
no
one
else
does
and
this
is
a
palladium
of
individuality
bad
as
is
the
principle
the
selections
are
worse
including
the
saccharinity
ineffable
of
tennyson
princess
a
strange
expression
of
the
progressive
feminization
of
the
high
school
and
yet
satirizing
the
scholastic
aspiration
of
girls
which
the
virile
boy
abhors
books
about

which
are
two
removes
from
life
and
ponderous

for

suggest
david

and
which
warp
and
pervert
the
nascent
on
a
foreign
model
worst
of
all
the
prime
moral
purpose
of
youthful
reading
is
ignored
in
choices
based
on
form
and
style
and
a
growing
profusion
of
notes
that
distract
from
content
to
language
the
study
of
which
belongs
in
the
college
if
not
in
the
university
develops
the
tendencies
of
criticism
before
the
higher
powers
of
sympathetic
appreciation
have
done
their
work
b
other
new
mental
powers
and
aptitudes
are
as
yet
too
little
studied
very
slight
are
the
observations
so
far
made
of
historic
which
is
so
clearly
akin
to
literary
interest
and
capacity
with
regard
to
this
and
several
other
subjects
in
the
curriculum
we
are
in
the
state
of
watts
when
he
gazed
at
the
and
began
to
dream
of
the
we
are
just
recognizing
a
new
power
and
method
destined
to
reconstruct
and
increase
the
efficiency
of
education
but
only
after
a
long
and
toilsome
period
of
limited
successes
barnes
told
a
story
without
date
place
name
or
moral
and
compared
the
questions
which
children
would
like
to
have
answered
about
it
she
found
that
the
interest
of
girls
in
persons
or
the
number
who
asked
the
question
who
culminated
at
twelve
when
it
coincided
with
that
of
boys
but
that
the
latter
continued
to
rise
to
fifteen
the
interest
to
know
place
where
events
occurred
culminated
at
eleven
with
girls
and
at
fifteen
and
at
a
far
higher
point
with
boys
the
questions
how
and
why
calling
for
the
method
and
reason
both
culminated
at
twelve
for
girls
and
fifteen
for
boys
but
were
more
infrequent
and
showed
less
age
differences
than
the
preceding
question
interest
in
the
results
of
the
action
was
most
pronounced
of
all
culminating
at
twelve
in
girls
and
fifteen
in
boys
details
and
time
excited
far
less
interest
the
former
jointly
culminating
for
both
sexes
at
eleven
interest
in
the
truth
of
the
narrative
was
extremely
slight
although
it
became
manifest
at
fifteen
and
was
growing
at
sixteen
the
number
of
inferences
drawn
steadily
increased
with
age
although
the
increase
was
very
slight
after
thirteen
both
legitimate
and
critical
inferences
increased
after
eleven
while
imaginative
inferences
at
that
age
had
nearly
reached
their
maximum
interest
in
names
was
very
strong
throughout
as
in
primitive
people
boys
were
more
curious
concerning
who
where
and
how
girls
as
to
why
in
general
the
historic
curiosity
of
boys
was
greater
than
that
of
girls
and
culminated
later
the
inferences
drawn
from
an
imagined
finding
of
a
boat
and
arrows
on
a
lonely
island
indicate
that
the
power
of
inference
both
legitimate
and
imaginative
develops
strongly
at
twelve
and
thirteen
after
which
doubt
and
the
critical
faculties
are
apparent
which
coincides
with
tucker
conclusion
that
doubt
develops
at
thirteen
and
that
personal
inference
diminishes
about
that
age
the
children
were
given
two
accounts
of
the
fall
of
fort
sumter
one
in
the
terms
of
a
school
history
and
the
other
a
despatch
of
equal
length
from
major
anderson
and
asked
which
was
best
should
be
kept
and
why
choice
of
the
narrative
steadily
declined
after
eleven
and
that
of
the
despatch
increased
the
former
reaching
its
lowest
the
latter
its
highest
point
at
fifteen
indicating
a
preference
for
the
record
the
number
of
those
whose
choice
was
affected
by
style
showed
no
great
change
from
twelve
to
fifteen
but
rose
very
rapidly
for
the
nest
two
years
those
who
chose
the
despatch
because
it
was
true
signed
increased
rapidly
in
girls
and
boys
throughout
the
teens
and
the
preference
for
the
telegram
as
a
more
direct
source
increased
very
rapidly
from
thirteen
to
seventeen
other
studies
of
this
kind
led
barnes
to
conclude
that
children
remembered
items
by
groups
that
whole
groups
were
often
omitted
that
those
containing
most
action
were
best
remembered
that
what
is
remembered
is
remembered
with
great
accuracy
that
generalities
are
often
made
more
specific
that
the
number
of
details
a
child
carries
away
from
a
connected
narrative
is
not
much
above
fifty
so
that
their
numbers
should
be
limited
and
from
it
all
was
inferred
the
necessity
of
accuracy
of
massing
details
about
central
characters
or
incidents
letting
action
dominate
omitting
all
that
is
aside
from
the
main
line
of
the
story
of
bringing
out
cause
and
effect
and
dramatizing
where
possible
miss
patterson
collated
the
answers
of
children
to
the
question
what
does
mean
the
blanks
do
know
decreased
very
rapidly
from
six
to
eight
and
thereafter
maintained
a
slight
but
constant
percentage
those
who
expanded
the
phase
a
little
without
intelligence
were
most
numerous
from
eight
to
ten
while
the
proportion
who
gave
a
correct
explanation
rose
quite
steadily
for
both
sexes
and
culminated
at
fourteen
for
girls
and
fifteen
for
boys
the
latter
only
indicates
the
pupils
of
real
historic
knowledge
the
writer
concludes
that
the
sense
of
historical
time
is
altogether
lacking
with
children
of
seven
and
may
be
described
as
slight
up
to
the
age
of
twelve
history
it
is
thought
should
be
introduced
early
with
no
difference
between
boys
and
girls
but
up
to
the
age
of
twelve
or
thirteen
it
should
be
presented
in
a
series
of
striking
biographies
and
events
appearing
if
possible
in
contemporary
ballads
and
chronicles
and
illustrated
by
maps
chronological
charts
and
as
richly
as
possible
by
pictures
of
contemporary
objects
buildings
and
people
at
the
age
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
another
sort
of
work
should
appear
original
sources
should
still
be
used
but
they
should
illustrate
not
the
picture
of
human
society
moving
before
us
in
a
long
panorama
but
should
give
us
the
opportunity
to
study
the
organization
thought
feeling
of
a
time
as
seen
in
its
concrete
embodiments
its
documents
monuments
men
and
books
the
statesmen
thinkers
poets
should
now
exceed
explorers
and
fighters
reflection
and
interpretation
discrimination
of
the
true
from
the
false
comparison
are
now
first
in
order
while
later
yet
perhaps
in
college
should
come
severer
methods
and
special
monographic
study
studies
of
mentality
so
well
advanced
for
infants
and
so
well
begun
for
lower
grades
are
still
very
meager
for
adolescent
stages
so
far
as
they
bear
on
growth
in
the
power
to
deal
with
arithmetic
drawing
and
pictures
puzzles
superstitions
collections
attention
reason
etc
enough
has
been
done
to
show
that
with
authority
to
collect
data
on
plans
and
by
methods
that
can
now
be
operated
and
with
aid
which
should
now
be
appropriated
by
school
boards
and
associations
incalculable
pedagogic
economy
could
be
secured
and
the
scientific
and
professional
character
of
teaching
every
topic
in
upper
grammar
and
high
school
and
even
in
the
early
college
grades
be
greatly
enhanced
to
enter
upon
this
laborious
task
in
every
branch
of
study
is
perhaps
our

bolton
tested
the
power
of
children
to
remember
and
write
dictated
digits
and
found
of
course
increasing
accuracy
with
the
older
pupils
he
also
found
that
the
memory
span
increased
with
age
rather
than
with
the
growth
of
intelligence
as
determined
by
grade
the
pupils
depended
largely
upon
visualisation
and
this
and
concentrated
attention
suggested
that
growth
of
memory
did
not
necessarily
accompany
intellectual
advancement
girls
generally
surpassed
boys
and
as
with
clicks
too
rapid
to
be
counted
it
was
found
that
when
the
pupils
reached
the
limits
of
their
span
the
number
of
digits
was
overestimated
the
power
of
concentrated
and
prolonged
attention
was
tested
the
probability
of
error
for
the
larger
number
of
digits
and
decreased
in
a
marked
way
with
the
development
of
pubescence
at
least
up
to
fourteen
years
with
the
suggestion
of
a
slight
rise
again
at
fifteen
in
comprehensive
tests
of
the
ability
of
chicago
children
to
remember
figures
seen
heard
or
repeated
by
them
it
was
found
that
from
seven
to
nine
auditory
were
slightly
better
remembered
than
visual
impressions
from
that
age
the
latter
steadily
increased
over
the
former
after
thirteen
auditory
memory
increased
but
little
and
was
already
about
ten
per
cent
behind
visual
which
continued
to
increase
at
least
till
seventeen
audiovisual
memory
was
better
than
either
alone
and
the
span
of
even
this
was
improved
when
articulatory
memory
was
added
when
the
tests
were
made
upon
pupils
of
the
same
age
in
different
grades
it
was
found
in
chicago
that
memory
power
whether
tested
by
sight
hearing
or
articulation
was
best
in
those
pupils
whose
school
standing
was
highest
and
least
where
standing
was
lowest
when
a
series
of
digits
was
immediately
repeated
orally
and
a
record
made
it
was
found
that
while
from
the
age
of
eight
to
twelve
the
memory
span
increased
only
eight
points
from
fourteen
to
eighteen
it
increased
thirteen
points
the
number
of
correct
reproductions
of
numbers
of
seven
places
increased
during
the
teens
although
this
class
of
children
remain
about
one
digit
behind
normal
children
of
corresponding
age
in
general
though
not
without
exceptions
it
was
found
that
intelligence
grew
with
memory
span
although
the
former
is
far
more
inferior
to
that
of
the
normal
child
than
the
latter
and
also
that
weakness
of
this
kind
of
memory
is
not
an
especially
prominent
factor
of
shaw
tested
memory
in
school
children
by
dividing
a
story
of
words
into
phrases
having
it
read
and
immediately
reproduced
by
them
and
selecting
alternate
grades
from
the
third
grammar
to
the
end
of
the
high
school
with
a
few
college
students
the
maximum
power
of
this
kind
of
memory
was
attained
by
boys
in
the
high
school
period
girls
remembered
per
cent
in
the
seventh
grade
and
in
the
high
school
per
cent
the
increase
by
periods
was
most
rapid
between
the
third
and
fifth
grades
four
terms
were
remembered
on
the
average
by
at
least
ninety
per
cent
of
the
pupils
by
fifty
per
cent
and
by
ten
per
cent
the
story
written
out
in
the
terms
remembered
by
each
percentage
from
ten
to
ninety
affords
a
most
interesting
picture
of
the
growth
of
memory
and
even
its
errors
of
omission
insertion
substitution
and
displacement
the
growth
of
memory
is
more
rapid
in
the
case
of
girls
than
boys
and
the
figures
suggest
a
coincidence
with
the
general
law
that
the
rapid
development
incident
to
puberty
occurs
earlier
in
girls
than
in
boys
in
a
careful
study
of
children
memory
kemsies
concludes
that
the
quality
of
memory
improves
with
age
more
rapidly
than
the
quantity

was
best
at

both

twelve
very

also
were
given

the
above
eight
series
of
twelve
each
were
all
reproduced
in

and
showed
that
each
kind
of

here
tested
increased
with
age
with
some
slight
tendency
to
decline
at
or
just
before
puberty
then
to
rise
and
to
slightly
decline
after
the

seventeenth
year

showed
the
greatest
amount
of
increase
during

year

works
for

next
although
at
all
ages
the
latter
was
considerably
below
the
former
boys
showed
stronger
memory
for
real
impressions
and
girls
excelled
for
numbers
and
words
the
difference
of
these
two
kinds
of
memory
was
less
with
girls
than
with
boys
the
greatest
difference
between
the
sexes
lay
between
eleven
and
fourteen
years
this
seems
at
eighteen
or
nineteen
to
be
slightly
increased
this
is
especially
great
at
the
age
of
puberty
children
from
nine
to
eleven
have
but
slight
power
of
reproducing
emotions
but
this
increases
in
the
next
few
years
very
rapidly
as
does
that
of
the
abstract
words
girls
from
nine
to
eleven
deal
better
with
words
than
with

boys
slightly
excel

is
not

acoustic

the

thus
the

is
by
no
means
the

focuses
on
some

from
the

memories
of
correspondents
with
memories
from
which
he
reached
the
conclusions
represented
in

for
the

of
the

remembered
is
represented
by
the
distance
upward
there
is
a
rise
in
all
the
curves
at

this
shows
that
from
the
age
of
twelve
to
fifteen
boys
do
not
recall
so
early
memories
as
they
do
both
before
and
after
this
period
this
colegrove
ascribes
to
the
fact
that
the
present
seems
so
large
and
rich
at
any
rate
the
earliest
memories
of
boys
at
the
age
of
fourteen
average
almost
four
years
his
curves
for
girls
show
that
the
age
of
all
the
first
three
memories
which
they
are
able
to
recall
is
higher
at
fourteen
than
at
any
period
before
or
after
that
at
seven
and
eight
the
average
age
of
the
first
things
recalled
is
nearly
a
year
earlier
than
it
is
at
fourteen
this
means
that
at
puberty
there
is
a
marked
and
characteristic
obliteration
of
infantile
memories
which
lapse
to
oblivion
with
augmented
absorption
in
the
present
illustration
untitled
graph
it
was
found
that
males
have
the
greatest
number
of
memories
for
protracted
or
repeated
occurrences
for
people
and
clothing
topographical
and
logical
matters
that
females
have
better
memories
for
novel
occurrences
or
single
impressions
already
at

motor
memories
begin
to
decrease
for
females
and
increase
for

at
fourteen
and
fifteen
motor
memories
nearly
culminate
for
males
but
still
further
decline
for
females
the
former
show
a
marked
decrease
in
memory
for
relatives
and
playmates
and
an
increase
for
other
persons
sickness
and
accidents
to
self
are
remembered
less
by
males
and
better
by
females
as
are
memories
of
fears
at
eighteen
and
nineteen
there
is
a
marked
and
continued
increase
in
the
visual
memories
of
each
sex
and
the
auditory
memory
of
females
memory
for
the
activity
of

increases
for
both
but
far
more
strongly
for
males
colegrove
concludes
from
his
data
that
the
period
of
adolescence
is
one
of
great
psychical
awaking
a
wide
range
of
memories
is
found
at
this
time
from
the
fourteenth
year
with
girls
and
the
fifteenth
with
boys
the
auditory
memories
are
strongly
developed
at
the
dawn
of
adolescence
the
motor
memory
of
voice
nearly
culminates
and
they
have
fewer
memories
of
sickness
and
accidents
to
self
during
this
time
the
memory
of
other
persons
and
the
activity
of
others
is
emphasized
in
case
of
both
boys
and
girls
in
general
at
this
period
the
special
sensory
memories
are
numerous
and
it
is
the
golden
age
for
motor
memories
now
too
the
memories
of
high
ideals
and
are
cherished
wider
interests
than
self
and
immediate
friends
become
the
objects
of
reflection
and
recollection
after
twenty
there
is
marked
change
in
the
memory
content
the
male
acquires
more
and
the
female
less
visual
and
auditory
memories
the
memories
of
the
female
are
more
logical
and
topographical
features
increase
memories
of
sickness
and
accidents
to
self
decrease
with
the
males
and
increase
with
the
females
while
in
the
case
of
both
there
is
relative
decline
in
the
memories
of
sickness
and
accident
to
others
from
all
this
it
would
appear
that
different
memories
culminate
at
different
periods
and
bear
immediate
relation
to
the
whole
mental
life
of
the
period
while
perhaps
some
of
the
finer
analyses
of
colegrove
may
invite
further
confirmation
his
main
results
given
above
are
not
only
suggestive
but
rendered
very
plausible
by
his
evidence
statistics
based
upon
replies
to
the
question
as
to
whether
pleasant
or
unpleasant
experiences
were
best
remembered
show
that
the
former
increase
at
eleven
rise
rapidly
at
fourteen
and
culminate
at
eighteen
for
males
and
that
the
curve
of
painful
memories
follows
the
same
course
although
for
both
there
is
a
drop
at
fifteen
for
females
the
pleasant
memories
increase
rapidly
from
eleven
to
thirteen
decline
a
little
at
fourteen
rise
again
at
sixteen
and
culminate
at
seventeen
and
the
painful
memories
follow
nearly
the
same
course
only
with
a
slight
drop
at
fifteen
thus
up
to
for
males
there
is
a
marked
preponderance
of
pleasant
over
painful
memories
although
the
two
rise
and
fall
together
after
thirty
unpleasant
memories
are
but
little
recalled
for
the
indians
and
negroes
in
this
census
unpleasant
memories
play
a
far
more
and
often
preponderating
rôle
suggesting
persecution
and
sad
experiences
different
elements
of
the
total
content
of
memory
come
to
prominence
at
different
ages
he
also
found
that
the
best
remembered
years
of
life
are
sixteen
to
seventeen
for
males
and
fifteen
for
females
and
that
in
general
the
adolescent
period
has
more
to
do
than
any
other
in
forming
and
furnishing
the
memory
plexus
while
the
seventh
and
eighth

are
most
poorly

her

have
forced

to

that

is
not

to
that
of

the

thank
you
my
dear
those
who
love
to
be
called

and
appeal
to
instincts
half
parental
in
their
lovers
and
husbands
those
who
find
all
the
sphere
they
desire
in
a
doll
house
like
nora
and
are
content
to
be
men
pets
whose
ideal
is
the
clinging
vine
and
who
take
no
interest
in
the
field
where
their
husbands
struggle
will
perhaps
soon
survive
only
as
a
diminishing
remainder
marriages
do
still
occur
where
woman
ignorance
and
helplessness
seem
to
be
the
chief
charm
to
men
and
may
be
happy
but
such
cases
are
no
farther
from
the
present
ideal
and
tendency
on
the
one
hand
than
on
the
other
are
those
which
consist
in
intellectual
partnerships
in
which
there
is
no
segregation
of
interests
but
which
are
devoted
throughout
to
joint
work
or
enjoyment
a
typical
contemporary
writer
thinks
the
question
whether
a
girl
shall
receive
a
college
education
is
very
like
the
same
question
for
boys
even
if
the
four

kinder
kuchen
and
which
may
be
translated
by
the
four
c
children
cooking
and
are
her
vocation
college
may
help
her
the
best
training
for
a
young
woman
is
not
the
old
college
course
that
has
proven
unfit
for
young
men
most
college
men
look
forward
to
a
professional
training
as
few
women
do
the
latter
have
often
greater
sympathy
readiness
of
memory
patience
with
technic
skill
in
literature
and
language
but
lack
originality
are
not
attracted
by
unsolved
problems
are
less
but
their
training
is
just
as
serious
and
important
as
that
of
men
the
best
results
are
where
the
sexes
are
brought
closer
together
because
their
separation
generally
emphasizes
for
girls
the
technical
training
for
the
profession
of
womanhood
with
girls
literature
and
language
take
precedence
over
science
expression
stands
higher
than
action
the
scholarship
may
be
superior
but
is
not
effective
the
educated
woman
is
likely
to
master
technic
rather
than
art
method
rather
than
substance
she
may
know
a
good
deal
but
she
can
do
nothing
in
most
separate
colleges
for
women
old
traditions
are
more
prevalent
than
in
colleges
for
men
in
the
annex
system
she
does
not
get
the
best
of
the
institution
by
the
coeducation
method
young
men
are
more
earnest
better
in
manners
and
morals
and
in
all
ways
more
civilized
than
under
monastic
conditions
the
women
do
more
work
in
a
more
natural
way
with
better
perspective
and
with
saner
incentives
than
when
isolated
from
the
influence
of
the
society
of
men
there
is
less
silliness
and
folly
where
a
man
is
not
a
novelty
in
coeducational
institutions
of
high
standards
frivolous
conduct
or
scandals
of
any
form
are
rarely
known
the
responsibility
for
decorum
is
thrown
from
the
school
to
the
woman
and
the
woman
rises
to
the
responsibility
the
character
of
college
work
has
not
been
lowered
but
raised
by
coeducation
despite
the
fact
that
most
of
the
new
small
weak
colleges
are
coeducational
social
strain
jordan
thinks
is
easily
regulated
and
the
dormitory
system
is
on
the
whole
best
because
the
college
atmosphere
is
highly
prized
the
reasons
for
the
present
reaction
against
coeducation
are
ascribed
partly
to
the
dislike
of
the
idle
boy
to
have
girls
excel
him
and
see
his
failures
or
because
rowdyish
tendencies
are
checked
by
the
presence
of
women
some
think
that
girls
do
not
help
athletics
that
men
count
for
most
because
they
are
more
apt
to
be
heard
from
later
but
the
most
serious
new
argument
is
the
fear
that
woman
standards
and
amateurishness
will
take
the
place
of
specialization
women
take
up
higher
education
because
they
like
it
men
because
their
careers
depend
upon
it
hence
their
studies
are
more
objective
and
face
the
world
as
it
is
in
college
the
women
do
as
well
as
men
but
not
in
the
university
the
woman
as
a
social
factor
has
produced
many
soft
lecture
courses
and
cheap
books
this
is
an
argument
for
the
higher
education
of
the
sex
finally
jordan
insists
that
coeducation
leads
to
marriage
and
he
believes
that
its
best
basis
is
common
interest
and
intellectual
friendship
from
the
available
data
it
seems
however
that
the
more
scholastic
the
education
of
women
the
fewer
children
and
the
harder
more
dangerous
and
more
dreaded
is
parturition
and
the
less
the
ability
to
nurse
children
not
intelligence
but
education
by
present
ways
is
inversely
as
fecundity
the
sooner
and
the
more
clearly
this
is
recognized
as
a
universal
rule
not
of
course
without
many
notable
and
much
vaunted
exceptions
the
better
for
our
civilization
for
one
i
plead
with
no
whit
less
earnestness
and
conviction
than
any
of
the
feminists
and
indeed
with
more
fervor
because
on
nearly
all
their
grounds
and
also
on
others
for
the
higher
education
of
women
and
would
welcome
them
to
every
opportunity
available
to
men
if
they
can
not
do
better
but
i
would
open
to
their
election
another
education
which
every
competent
judge
would
pronounce
more
favorable
to
motherhood
under
the
influence
of
female
principals
who
do
not
publicly
say
that
it
is
not
desirable
that
women
students
should
study
motherhood
because
they
do
not
know
whether
they
will
marry
who
encourage
them
to
elect
no
special
subjects
because
they
are
women
and
who
think
infant
psychology
foolish
various
interesting
experiments
in
coeducation
are
now
being
made
in
england
some
are
and
encourage
the
girls
to
do
almost
everything
that
the
boys
do
in
both
study
and
play
there
are
girl
prefects
cricket
teams
are
formed
sometimes
of
both
sexes
but
often
the
sexes
matched
against
each
other
one
a
dual
staff
of
teachers
and
friendships
between
the
boys
and
girls
are
not
tabooed
etc
in
other
schools
the
sexes
meet
perhaps
in
recitation
only
have
separate
rooms
for
study
entrances
and
their
relations
are
otherwise
restricted
the
opinion
of
english
writers
generally
favors
coeducation
up
to
about
the
beginning
of
the
teens
and
from
there
on
views
are
more
divided
it
is
admitted
that
if
there
is
a
very
great
preponderance
of
either
sex
over
the
other
the
latter
is
likely
to
lose
its
characteristic
qualities
and
something
of
this
occurs
where
the
average
age
of
one
sex
is
distinctly
greater
than
that
of
the
other
on
the
other
hand
several
urge
that
where
age
and
numbers
are
equal
each
sex
is
more
inclined
to
develop
the
best
qualities
peculiar
to
itself
in
the
presence
of
the
other
some
girls
are
no
doubt
far
fitter
for
boys
studies
and
men
careers
than
others
coeducation
too
generally
means
far
more
assimilation
of
girls
to
boys
ways
and
work
than
conversely
many
people
believe
that
girls
either
gain
or
are
more
affected
by
coeducation
especially
in
the
upper
grades
than
boys
it
is
interesting
however
to
observe
the
differences
that
still
persist
certain
games
like
football
and
boxing
girls
can
not
play
they
do
not
fight
they
are
not
flogged
or
caned
as
english
boys
are
when
their
bad
marks
foot
up
beyond
a
certain
aggregate
girls
are
more
prone
to
cliques
their
punishments
must
be
in
appeals
to
school
sentiment
to
which
they
are
exceedingly
sensitive
it
is
hard
for
them
to
bear
defeat
in
games
with
the
same
dignity
and
unruffled
temper
as
boys
it
is
harder
for
them
to
accept
the
school
standards
of
honor
that
condemn
the
as
a
sneak
although
they
soon
learn
this
they
may
be
a
little
in
danger
of
being
roughened
by
boyish
ways
and
especially
by
the
crude
and
unique
language
almost
a
dialect
in
itself
prevalent
among
schoolboys
girls
are
far
more
prone
to
overdo
boys
are
persistingly
lazy
and
idle
girls
are
content
to
sit
and
have
the
pumped
into
them
by
recitations
and
to
merely
accept
while
boys
are
more
inspired
by
being
told
to
do
things
and
make
tests
and
experiments
in
this
girls
are
often
quite
at
sea
one
writer
speaks
of
a
certain
feminine
obliquity
but
hastens
to
say
that
girls
in
these
schools
soon
accept
its
code
of
honor
it
is
urged
too
that
singing
classes
the
voices
of
each
sex
are
better
in
quality
for
the
presence
of
the
other
in
many
topics
of
all
kinds
boys
and
girls
are
interested
in
different
aspects
of
the
same
theme
and
therefore
the
work
is
broadened
in
manual
training
girls
excel
in
all
artistic
work
boys
in
carpentry
girls
can
be
made
not
only
less
noxiously
sentimental
and
impulsive
but
their
conduct
tends
to
become
more
thoughtful
they
can
be
made
to
feel
responsibility
for
bestowing
their
praise
aright
and
thus
influencing
the
tone
of
the
school
calamitous
as
it
world
be
for
the
education
of
boys
beyond
a
certain
age
to
be
entrusted
entirely
or
chiefly
to
women
it
would
be
less
so
for
that
of
girls
to
be
given
entirely
to
men
perhaps
the
great
women
teachers
whose
life
and
work
have
made
them
a
power
with
girls
comparable
to
that
of
arnold
and
thring
with
boys
are
dying
out
very
likely
economic
motives
are
too
dominant
for
this
problem
to
be
settled
on
its
merits
only
finally
several
writers
mention
the
increased
healthfulness
of
moral
tone
the
vices
that
infest
boys
schools
which
arnold
thought
a
quantity
constantly
changing
with
every
class
are
diminished
healthful
thoughts
of
sex
less
subterranean
and
base
imaginings
on
the
one
hand
and
less
gushy
sentimentality
on
the
other
are
favored
for
either
sex
to
be
a
copy
of
the
other
is
to
be
weakened
and
each
comes
normally
to
respect
more
and
to
prefer
its
own
sex
not
to
pursue
this
subject
further
here
it
is
probable
that
many
of
the
causes
for
the
facts
set
forth
are
very
different
and
some
of
them
almost
diametrically
opposite
in
the
two
sexes
hard
as
it
is
it
is
after
all
a
comparatively
easy
matter
to
educate
boys
they
are
less
peculiarly
responsive
in
mental
tone
to
the
physical
and
psychic
environment
tend
more
strongly
and
early
to
special
interests
and
react
more
vigorously
against
the
obnoxious
elements
of
their
surroundings
this
is
truest
of
the
higher
education
and
more
so
in
proportion
as
the
tendencies
of
the
age
are
toward
special
and
vocational
training
woman
as
we
saw
in
every
fiber
of
her
soul
and
body
is
a
more
generic
creature
than
man
nearer
to
the
race
and
demands
more
and
more
with
advancing
age
an
education
that
is
essentially
liberal
and
humanistic
this
is
progressively
hard
when
the
sexes
differentiate
in
the
higher
grades
moreover
nature
decrees
that
with
advancing
civilization
the
sexes
shall
not
approximate
but
differentiate
and
we
shall
probably
be
obliged
to
carry
sex
distinctions
at
least
of
method
into
many
if
not
most
of
the
topics
of
the
higher
education
now
that
woman
has
by
general
consent
attained
the
right
to
the
best
that
man
has
she
must
seek
a
training
that
fits
her
own
nature
as
well
or
better
so
long
as
she
strives
to
be
manlike
she
will
be
inferior
and
a
pinchbeck
imitation
but
she
must
develop
a
new
sphere
that
shall
be
like
the
rich
field
of
the
cloth
of
gold
for
the
best
instincts
of
her
nature
divergence
is
most
marked
and
sudden
in
the
pubescent
period
in
the
early
teens
at
this
age
by
almost
consent
boys
and
girls
separate
for
a
time
and
lead
their
lives
during
this
most
critical
period
more
or
less
apart
at
least
for
a
few
years
until
the
ferment
of
mind
and
body
which
results
in
maturity
of
functions
then
born
and
culminating
in
nubility
has
done
its
work
the
family
and
the
home
abundantly
recognize
this
tendency
at
twelve
or
fourteen
brothers
and
sisters
develop
a
life
more
independent
of
each
other
than
before
their
home
occupations
differ
as
do
their
plays
games
tastes
history
anthropology
and
sociology
a
well
as
home
life
abundantly
illustrate
this
this
is
normal
and
biological
what
our
schools
and
other
institutions
should
do
is
not
to
obliterate
these
differences
but
to
make
boys
more
manly
and
girls
more
womanly
we
should
respect
the
law
of
sexual
differences
and
not
forget
that
motherhood
is
a
very
different
thing
from
fatherhood
neither
sex
should
copy
nor
set
patterns
to
the
other
but
all
parts
should
be
played
harmoniously
and
clearly
in
the
great
sex
symphony
i
have
here
less
to
say
against
coeducation
in
college
still
less
in
university
grades
after
the
maturity
which
comes
at
eighteen
or
twenty
has
been
achieved
but
it
is
high
time
to
ask
ourselves
whether
the
theory
and
practise
of
identical
coeducation
especially
in
the
high
school
which
has
lately
been
carried
to
a
greater
extreme
in
this
country
than
the
rest
of
the
world
recognizes
has
not
brought
certain
grave
dangers
and
whether
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
natural
differentiations
seen
everywhere
else
i
recognize
of
course
the
great
argument
of
economy
indeed
we
should
save
money
and
effort
could
we
unite
churches
of
not
too
diverse
creeds
we
could
thus
give
better
preaching
music
improve
the
edifice
etc
i
am
by
no
means
ready
to
advocate
the
radical
abolition
of
coeducation
but
we
can
already
sum
up
in
a
rough
brief
way
our
account
of
profit
and
loss
with
it
on
the
one
hand
no
doubt
each
sex
develops
some
of
its
own
best
qualities
best
in
the
presence
of
the
other
but
the
question
still
remains
how
much
when
and
in
what
way
identical
coeducation
secures
this
end
as
has
been
said
girls
and
boys
are
often
interested
in
different
aspects
of
the
same
topic
and
this
may
have
a
tendency
to
broaden
the
of
both
and
bring
it
into
sympathy
with
that
of
the
other
but
the
question
still
remains
whether
one
be
not
too
much
attracted
to
the
sphere
of
the
other
especially
girls
to
that
of
boys
no
doubt
some
girls
become
a
little
less
gushy
their
conduct
more
thoughtful
and
their
sense
of
responsibility
greater
for
one
of
woman
great
functions
which
is
that
of
bestowing
praise
aright
is
increased
there
is
also
much
evidence
that
certain
boys
vices
are
mitigated
they
are
made
more
urbane
and
their
thoughts
of
sex
made
more
healthful
in
some
respects
boys
are
stimulated
to
good
scholarship
by
girls
who
in
many
schools
and
topics
excel
them
we
should
ask
however
what
is
nature
way
at
this
stage
of
life
whether
boys
in
order
to
be
well
virified
later
ought
not
to
be
so
boisterous
and
even
rough
as
to
be
at
times
unfit
companions
for
girls
or
whether
on
the
other
hand
girls
to
be
best
matured
ought
not
to
have
their
sentimental
periods
of
instability
especially
when
we
venture
to
raise
the
question
whether
for
a
girl
in
the
early
teens
when
her
health
for
her
whole
life
depends
upon
normalizing
the
lunar
month
there
is
not
something
unhygienic
unnatural
not
to
say
a
little
monstrous
in
school
associations
with
boys
when
she
must
suppress
and
conceal
her
feelings
and
instinctive
promptings
at
those
times
which
suggest
withdrawing
to
let
nature
do
its
beautiful
work
of
inflorescence
it
is
a
sacred
time
of
reverent
exemption
from
the
hard
struggle
of
existence
in
the
world
and
from
mental
effort
in
the
school
medical
specialists
many
of
the
best
of
whom
now
insist
that
through
this
period
she
should
be
as
it
were
turned
out
to
grass
or
should
lie
fallow
so
far
as
intellectual
efforts
go
the
time
no
doubt
often
go
too
far
but
their
unanimous
voice
should
not
entirely
be
disregarded
it
is
not
this
however
that
i
have
chiefly
in
mind
here
but
the
effects
of
too
familiar
relations
and
especially
of
the
identical
work
treatment
and
environment
of
the
modern
school
we
have
now
at
least
eight
good
and
independent
statistical
studies
which
show
that
the
ideals
of
boys
from
ten
years
on
are
almost
always
those
of
their
own
sex
while
girls
ideals
are
increasingly
of
the
opposite
sex
or
those
of
men
that
the
ideals
of
pubescent
girls
are
not
found
in
the
great
and
noble
women
of
the
world
or
in
their
literature
but
more
and
more
in
men
suggests
a
divorce
between
the
ideals
adopted
and
the
line
of
life
best
suited
to
the
interests
of
the
race
we
are
not
furnished
in
our
public
schools
with
adequate
womanly
ideals
in
history
or
literature
the
new
love
of
freedom
which
women
have
lately
felt
inclines
girls
to
abandon
the
home
for
the
office
it
surely
can
hardly
be
called
an
ideal
education
for
women
that
permits
eighteen
out
of
one
hundred
college
girls
to
state
boldly
that
they
would
rather
be
men
than
women
more
than
of
the
schoolgirls
in
these
censuses
choose
male
ideals
as
if
those
of
femininity
are
disintegrating
a
recent
writer
in
view
of
this
fact
states
that
unless
there
is
a
change
of
trend
we
shall
soon
have
a
female
sex
without
a
female
character
in
the
progressive
numerical
feminization
of
our
schools
most
teachers
perhaps
naturally
and
necessarily
have
more
or
less
masculine
ideals
and
this
does
not
encourage
the
development
of
those
that
constitute
the
glory
of
womanhood
at
every
age
from
eight
to
sixteen
girls
named
from
three
to
twenty
more
ideals
than
boys
these
facts
indicate
a
condition
of
diffused
interests
and
lack
of
purposes
and
a
need
of
integration
when
we
turn
to
boys
the
case
is
different
in
most
public
high
schools
girls
preponderate
especially
in
the
upper
classes
and
in
many
of
them
the
boys
that
remain
are
practically
in
a
girls
school
sometimes
taught
chiefly
if
not
solely
by
women
teachers
at
an
age
when
strong
men
should
be
in
control
more
than
at
any
other
period
of
life
boys
need
a
different
discipline
and
moral
regimen
and
atmosphere
they
also
need
a
different
method
of
work
girls
excel
them
in
learning
and
memorization
accepting
studies
upon
suggestion
or
authority
but
are
often
quite
at
sea
when
set
to
make
tests
and
experiments
that
give
individuality
and
a
chance
for
which
is
one
of
the
best
things
in
boyhood
girls
preponderate
in
our
overgrown
high
school
latin
and
algebra
because
custom
and
tradition
and
perhaps
advice
incline
them
to
it
they
preponderate
in
english
and
history
classes
more
often
let
us
hope
from
inner
inclination
the
boy
sooner
grows
restless
in
a
curriculum
where
form
takes
precedence
over
content
he
revolts
at
much
method
with
meager
matter
he
craves
utility
and
when
all
these
instincts
are
denied
without
knowing
what
is
the
matter
he
drops
out
of
school
when
with
robust
tone
and
with
a
truly
boy
life
such
as
prevails
at
harrow
eton
and
rugby
he
would
have
fought
it
through
and
have
done
well
this
feminization
of
the
school
spirit
discipline
and
personnel
is
bad
for
boys
of
course
on
the
whole
perhaps
they
are
made
more
gentlemanly
more
at
ease
their
manners
improved
and
all
this
to
a
woman
teacher
seems
excellent
but
something
is
the
matter
with
the
boy
in
early
teens
who
can
be
truly
called
a
perfect
gentleman
that
should
come
later
when
the
brute
and
animal
element
have
had
opportunity
to
work
themselves
off
in
a
healthful
normal
way
they
still
have
football
to
themselves
and
are
the
majority
perhaps
in
chemistry
and
sometimes
in
physics
but
there
is
danger
of
a
settled
eviration
the
segregation
which
even
some
of
our
schools
are
now
attempting
is
always
in
some
degree
necessary
for
full
and
complete
development
just
as
the
boys
language
is
apt
to
creep
into
that
of
the
girl
so
girls
interests
ways
standards
and
tastes
which
are
crude
at
this
age
sometimes
attract
boys
out
of
their
orbit
while
some
differences
are
emphasized
by
contact
others
are
compromised
boys
tend
to
grow
content
with
mechanical
memorized
work
and
excelling
on
the
lines
of
girls
qualities
fail
to
develop
those
of
their
own
there
is
a
little
charm
and
bloom
rubbed
off
the
ideal
of
girlhood
by
close
contact
and
boyhood
seems
less
ideal
to
girls
at
close
range
in
place
of
the
mystic
attraction
of
the
other
sex
that
has
inspired
so
much
that
is
best
in
the
world
familiar
comradeship
brings
a
little
disenchantment
the
impulse
to
be
at
one
best
in
the
presence
of
the
other
sex
prows
lax
and
sex
tension
remits
and
each
comes
to
feel
itself
seen
through
so
that
there
is
less
motive
to
indulge
in
the
ideal
conduct
which
such
motives
inspire
because
the
call
for
it
is
incessant
this
disillusioning
weakens
the
motivation
to
marriage
sometimes
on
both
sides
when
girls
grow
careless
in
their
dress
and
too
negligent
in
their
manners
one
of
the
best
schools
of
woman
morals
and
when
boys
lose
all
restraints
which
the
presence
of
girls
usually
enforces
there
is
a
subtle
deterioration
thus
i
believe
although
of
course
it
is
impossible
to
prove
that
this
is
one
of
the
factors
of
a
decreasing
percentage
of
marriage
among
educated
young
men
and
women
at
eighteen
or
twenty
the
girl
normally
reaches
a
stage
of
first
maturity
when
her
ideas
of
life
are
amazingly
keen
and
true
when
if
her
body
is
developed
she
can
endure
a
great
deal
when
she
is
nearest
perhaps
the
ideal
of
feminine
beauty
and
perfection
of
this
we
saw
illustrations
in
chapter
viii
in
our
environment
however
there
is
a
little
danger
that
this
age
once
well
past
there
will
slowly
arise
a
slight
sense
of
aimlessness
or
lassitude
unrest
uneasiness
as
if
one
were
almost
unconsciously
feeling
along
the
wall
for
a
door
to
which
the
key
was
not
at
hand
thus
some
lose
their
bloom
and
yielding
to
the
great
danger
of
young
womanhood
slowly
lapse
to
a
anxious
state
of
expectancy
or
desire
something
not
within
their
reach
and
so
the
diathesis
of
restlessness
slowly
supervenes
the
best
thing
about
college
life
for
girls
is
perhaps
that
it
postpones
this
incipient
disappointment
but
it
is
a
little
pathetic
to
me
to
read
as
i
have
lately
done
the
class
letters
of
hundreds
of
girl
graduates
out
of
college
one
two
or
three
years
turning
a
little
to
art
music
travel
teaching
charity
work
one
after
the
other
or
trying
to
find
something
to
which
they
can
devote
themselves
some
cause
movement
occupation
where
their
capacity
for
altruism
and
can
find
a
field
the
tension
is
almost
imperceptible
perhaps
quite
unconscious
it
is
everywhere
overborne
by
a
keen
interest
in
life
by
a
desire
to
know
the
world
at
first
hand
while
susceptibilities
are
at
their
height
the
apple
of
intelligence
has
been
plucked
at
perhaps
a
little
too
great
cost
of
health
the
purely
mental
has
not
been
quite
sufficiently
kept
back
the
girl
wishes
to
know
a
good
deal
more
of
the
world
and
perfect
her
own
personality
and
would
not
marry
although
every
cell
of
her
body
and
every
unconscious
impulse
points
to
just
that
end
soon
it
may
be
in
five
or
ten
years
or
more
the
complexion
of
ill
health
is
in
these
notes
or
else
life
has
been
adjusted
to
independence
and
many
of
these
bachelor
women
are
magnificent
in
mind
and
body
but
they
lack
wifehood
and
yet
more
motherhood
in
fine
we
should
use
these
facts
as
a
stimulus
to
ask
more
searchingly
the
question
whether
the
present
system
of
higher
education
for
both
sexes
is
not
lacking
in
some
very
essential
elements
and
if
so
what
these
are
indeed
considering
the
facts
that
in
our
social
system
man
makes
the
advances
and
that
woman
is
by
nature
more
prone
than
man
to
domesticity
and
parenthood
it
is
not
impossible
that
men
colleges
do
more
to
unfit
for
these
than
do
those
for
women
one
cause
may
be
moral
ethics
used
to
be
taught
as
a
practical
power
for
life
and
reënforced
by
religious
motives
now
it
is
theoretical
and
speculative
and
too
often
led
captive
by
metaphysical
and
epistemological
speculations
sometimes
girls
work
or
worry
more
over
studies
and
ideals
than
is
good
for
their
constitution
and
boys
grow
idle
and
indifferent
and
this
proverbially
tends
to
bad
habits
perhaps
fitting
for
college
has
been
too
hard
at
the
critical
age
of
about
eighteen
and
requirements
of
honest
persevering
work
during
college
years
too
little
enforced
or
grown
irksome
by
physiological
reaction
of
lassitude
from
the
strain
of
fitting
and
entering
again
girls
mature
earlier
than
boys
and
the
latter
who
have
been
educated
with
them
tend
to
certain
elements
of
maturity
and
completeness
too
early
in
life
and
their
growth
period
is
shortened
or
its
momentum
lessened
by
an
atmosphere
of
femininity
something
is
clearly
wrong
and
more
so
here
than
we
have
at
present
any
reason
to
think
is
the
case
among
the
academic
male
or
female
youth
of
other
lands
to
see
and
admit
that
there
is
an
evil
very
real
deep
exceedingly
difficult
and
complex
in
its
causes
but
grave
and
demanding
a
careful
reconsideration
of
current
educational
ideas
and
practises
is
the
first
step
and
this
every
thoughtful
and
mind
i
believe
must
now
take
it
is
utterly
impossible
without
injury
to
hold
girls
to
the
same
standards
of
conduct
regularity
severe
moral
accountability
and
strenuous
mental
work
that
boys
need
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
her
sex
are
inveterate
and
with
these
the
american
girl
in
the
middle
teens
fairly
tingles
with
a
consciousness
already
she
occasionally
asserts
herself
in
the
public
high
school
against
a
male
teacher
or
principal
who
seeks
to
enforce
discipline
by
methods
boys
respect
in
a
way
that
suggests
that
the
time
is
at
hand
when
popularity
with
her
sex
will
be
as
necessary
in
a
successful
teacher
as
it
is
in
the
pulpit
in
these
interesting
oases
where
girl
sentiment
has
made
itself
felt
in
school
it
has
generally
carried
parents
committeemen
the
press
and
public
sentiment
before
it
and
has
already
made
a
precious
little
list
of
martyrs
whom
were
i
an
educational
pope
i
would
promptly
canonize
the
progressive
feminization
of
secondary
education
works
its
subtle
demoralization
on
the
male
teachers
who
remain
public
sentiment
would
sustain
them
in
many
parental
exactions
with
boys
which
it
disallows
in
mixed
classes
it
is
hard
too
for
male
principals
of
schools
with
only
female
teachers
not
to
suffer
some
deterioration
in
the
moral
tone
of
their
virility
and
to
lose
in
the
power
to
cope
successfully
with
men
not
only
is
this
often
confessed
and
deplored
but
the
incessant
compromises
the
best
male
teachers
of
mixed
classes
must
make
with
their
pedagogic
convictions
in
both
teaching
and
discipline
make
the
profession
less
attractive
to
manly
men
of
large
caliber
and
of
sound
fiber
again
the
recent
rapid
increase
of
girls
the
percentage
of
which
to
population
in
high
schools
has
in
many
communities
doubled
in
but
little
more
than
a
decade
almost
necessarily
involves
a
decline
in
the
average
quality
of
girls
perhaps
as
much
greater
for
them
as
compared
with
boys
as
their
increase
has
been
greater
when
but
few
were
found
in
these
institutions
they
were
usually
picked
girls
with
superior
tastes
and
ability
but
now
the
average
girl
of
the
rank
and
file
is
despite
advanced
standard
of
admission
of
an
order
natively
lower
from
this
deterioration
both
boys
and
teachers
suffer
even
though
the
greatest
good
for
the
greatest
number
may
be
enhanced
once
more
it
is
generally
admitted
that
girls
in
good
where
evenings
food
and
regimen
are
controlled
are
in
better
health
than
day
pupils
with
social
church
and
domestic
duties
and
perhaps
worries
to
which
boys
are
less
subject
this
is
the
nascent
stage
of
periodicity
to
the
slow
normalization
of
which
during
these
few
critical
years
everything
that
interferes
should
yield
some
kind
of
tacit
recognition
of
this
is
indispensable
but
in
mixed
classes
every
form
of
such
concession
is
baffling
and
demoralizing
to
boys
the
women
who
really
achieve
the
higher
culture
should
make
it
their
cause
or
mission
to
work
out
the
new
humanistic
or
liberal
education
which
the
old
college
claimed
to
stand
for
and
which
now
needs
radical
reconstruction
to
meet
the
demands
of
modern
life
in
science
they
should
aim
to
restore
the
humanistic
elements
of
its
history
biography
its
popular
features
at
their
best
and
its
applications
in
all
the
more
fields
as
described
in
chapter
xii
and
feel
responsibility
not
to
let
the
moral
religious
and
poetic
aspects
of
nature
be
lost
in
utilities
woman
should
be
true
to
her
generic
nature
and
take
her
stand
against
all
premature
specialization
and
when
the
spirit
of
the
times
insists
on
specialized
training
for
occupative
pursuits
without
waiting
for
broad
foundations
to
be
laid
she
should
resist
all
these
influences
that
make
for
psychological
precocity
the
eternal
womanly
is
no
iridescent
fiction
but
a
very
definable
reality
and
means
perennial
youth
it
means
that
woman
at
her
best
never
outgrows
adolescence
as
man
does
but
lingers
in
magnifies
and
glorifies
this
culminating
stage
of
life
with
its
interests
its
convertibility
of
emotions
its
enthusiasm
and
zest
for
all
that
is
good
beautiful
true
and
heroic
this
constitutes
her
freshness
and
charm
even
in
age
and
makes
her
by
nature
more
humanistic
than
man
more
sympathetic
and
appreciative
it
is
not
chiefly
the
superfluous
massachusetts
women
of
the
last
census
but
representatives
of
every
class
and
age
in
the
women
clubs
of
this
country
that
now
find
some
leisure
for
general
culture
in
all
fields
and
in
which
most
of
them
no
doubt
surpass
their
husbands
those
who
still
say
that
men
do
not
like
women
to
be
their
mental
superiors
and
that
no
man
was
ever
won
by
the
attraction
of
intellect
on
the
one
hand
and
those
who
urge
that
women
really
want
husbands
to
be
their
intellectual
superiors
both
misapprehend
the
male
in
all
the
orders
of
life
is
the
agent
of
variation
and
tends
by
nature
to
expertness
and
specialisation
without
which
his
individuality
is
incomplete
in
his
chosen
line
he
would
lead
and
be
authoritative
and
he
rarely
seeks
partnership
in
it
in
marriage
this
is
no
subjection
but
woman
instinctively
respects
and
even
reveres
and
perhaps
educated
woman
coming
to
demand
it
in
the
man
of
her
choice
this
granted
man
was
never
more
plastic
to
woman
great
work
of
creating
in
him
all
the
wide
range
of
secondary
sex
qualities
which
constitute
his
essential
manhood
in
all
this
the
pedagogic
fathers
we
teach
in
the
history
of
education
are
most
of
them
about
as
luminous
and
obsolete
as
is
patristics
for
the
religious
teacher
or
as
methods
of
other
countries
are
coming
to
be
in
solving
our
own
peculiar
pedagogic
problems
the
relation
of
the
academically
trained
sexes
is
faintly
typified
by
that
of
the
ideal
college
to
the
ideal
university
professional
or
technical
school
this
is
the
harmony
of
counterparts
and
constitutes
the
best
basis
of
psychic
amphimixis
for
the
reinstallation
of
the
humanistic
college
the
time
has
come
when
cultivated
woman
ought
to
come
forward
and
render
vital
aid
if
she
does
so
and
helps
to
evolve
a
high
school
and
an
course
that
is
truly
liberal
it
will
not
only
fit
her
nature
and
needs
far
better
than
anything
now
existing
but
young
men
at
the
humanistic
stage
of
their
own
education
will
seek
to
profit
by
it
and
she
will
thus
repay
her
debt
to
man
in
the
past
by
aiding
him
to
the
college
and
to
rescue
secondary
education
from
its
gravest
dangers
but
even
should
all
this
be
done
coeducation
would
by
means
be
thus
justified
if
adolescent
boys
normally
pass
through
a
generalized
or
even
feminized
stage
of
psychic
development
in
which
they
are
peculiarly
plastic
to
the
guidance
of
older
women
who
have
such
rare
insight
into
their
nature
such
infinite
sympathy
and
patience
with
all
the
symptoms
of
their
storm
and
stress
metamorphosis
when
they
seek
everything
by
turns
and
nothing
long
and
if
young
men
will
forever
afterward
understand
woman
nature
better
for
living
out
more
fully
this
stage
of
their
lives
and
will
fail
to
do
so
if
it
is
abridged
or
dwarfed
it
by
no
means
follows
that
intimate
daily
and
association
with
girls
of
their
own
age
is
necessary
or
best
the
danger
of
this
is
that
the
boy
instinct
to
assert
his
own
manhood
will
thus
be
made
premature
and
excessive
that
he
will
react
against
general
culture
in
the
capacity
for
which
girls
who
are
older
than
boys
at
the
same
age
naturally
excel
them
companionship
and
comparisons
incline
him
to
take
premature
refuge
in
some
one
talent
that
emphasizes
his
difference
too
soon
again
he
is
farther
from
nubile
maturity
than
the
girl
classmate
of
his
own
age
and
coeducation
and
marriage
between
them
are
prone
to
violate
the
important
physiological
law
of
disparity
that
requires
the
husband
to
be
some
years
the
wife
senior
both
in
their
own
interests
as
maturity
begins
to
decline
to
age
and
in
those
of
their
offspring
thus
the
young
man
with
his
years
of
restraint
and
probation
ahead
and
his
inflammable
desires
is
best
removed
from
the
cerebrations
about
wedlock
inevitably
more
insistent
with
constant
girl
companionship
if
he
resists
this
during
all
the
years
of
his
apprenticeship
he
grows
more
immune
and
inhibitive
of
it
when
its
proper
hour
arrives
and
perhaps
becomes
in
soul
a
bachelor
before
his
time
in
this
side
of
his
nature
he
is
forever
incommensurate
with
and
unintelligible
to
woman
be
she
even
teacher
sister
or
mother
better
some
risk
of
gross
thoughts
and
even
acts
to
which
phylogeny
and
recapitulation
so
strongly
incline
him
than
this
subtle
eviration
but
if
the
boy
is
unduly
repelled
from
the
sphere
of
interests
the
girl
is
in
some
danger
of
being
unduly
drawn
to
his
and
as
we
saw
above
of
forgetting
some
of
the
ideals
of
her
own
sex
riper
in
mind
and
body
than
her
male
classmate
and
often
excelling
him
in
the
capacity
of
acquisition
nearer
the
age
of
her
full
maturity
than
he
to
his
he
seems
a
little
too
crude
and
callow
to
fulfil
the
ideals
of
manhood
normal
to
her
age
which
point
to
older
and
riper
men
in
all
that
makes
sexual
attraction
best
a
classmate
of
her
own
age
is
too
undeveloped
and
so
she
often
suffers
mute
disenchantment
and
even
if
engagement
be
dreamed
of
it
would
be
on
her
part
with
unconscious
reservations
if
not
with
some
conscious
renunciation
of
ideals
thus
the
boy
is
correct
in
feeling
himself
understood
and
seen
through
by
his
girl
classmates
to
a
degree
that
is
sometimes
quite
distasteful
to
him
while
the
girl
finds
herself
misunderstood
by
and
disappointed
in
men
boys
arrive
at
the
humanistic
stage
of
culture
later
than
girls
and
pass
it
sooner
and
to
find
them
already
there
and
with
their
greater
aptitude
excelling
him
is
not
an
inviting
situation
and
so
he
is
tempted
to
abridge
or
cut
it
out
and
to
hasten
on
and
be
mature
and
professional
before
his
time
for
thus
he
gravitates
toward
his
normal
relation
to
her
sex
of
expert
mastership
on
some
or
line
of
course
these
influences
are
not
patent
demonstrable
by
experiment
or
measurable
by
statistics
but
i
have
come
to
believe
that
like
many
other
facts
and
laws
they
have
a
reality
and
a
dominance
that
is
and
inescapable
and
that
they
will
ultimately
prevail
over
economic
motives
and
traditions
to
be
a
true
woman
means
to
be
yet
more
mother
than
wife
the
madonna
conception
expresses
man
highest
comprehension
of
woman
real
nature
sexual
relations
are
brief
but
love
and
care
of
offspring
are
long
the
elimination
of
maternity
is
one
of
the
great
calamities
if
not
diseases
of
our
age
marholm
points
out
at
length
how
art
again
gives
woman
a
waspish
waist
with
no
abdomen
as
if
to
carefully
score
away
every
trace
of
her
mission
usually
with
no
child
in
her
arms
or
even
in
sight
a
mere
figurine
calculated
perhaps
to
entice
but
not
to
bear
incidentally
degrading
the
artist
who
depicts
her
to
a
painter
perhaps
with
suggestions
of
the
arts
of
toilet
cosmetics
and
coquetry
as
if
to
promote
decadent
reaction
to
decadent
stimuli
as
in
the
munchausen
tale
the
wolf
slowly
ate
the
running
nag
from
behind
until
he
found
himself
in
the
harness
so
in
the
disoriented
woman
the
mistress
virtuous
and
otherwise
is
slowly
supplanting
the
mother
please
she
must
even
though
she
can
not
admire
and
can
so
easily
despise
men
who
can
not
lead
her
although
she
become
thereby
lax
and
vapid
the
more
exhausted
men
become
whether
by
overwork
unnatural
city
life
alcohol
recrudescent
polygamic
inclinations
exclusive
devotion
to
greed
and
pelf
whether
they
become
weak
stooping
or
gross
coarse
barbaric
and
bestial
the
more
they
lose
the
power
to
lead
woman
or
to
arouse
her
nature
which
is
essentially
passive
thus
her
perversions
are
his
fault
man
before
he
lost
the
soil
and
piety
was
not
only
her
protector
and
provider
but
her
priest
he
not
only
supported
and
defended
but
inspired
the
souls
of
women
so
admirably
calculated
to
receive
and
elaborate
suggestions
but
not
to
originate
them
in
their
inmost
souls
even
young
girls
often
experience
disenchantment
find
men
little
and
no
heroes
and
so
cease
to
revere
and
begin
to
think
stupidly
of
them
as
they
think
coarsely
of
her
sometimes
the
girlish
conceptions
of
men
are
too
romantic
and
exalted
often
the
intimacy
of
school
and
college
wear
off
a
charm
while
man
must
not
forget
that
he
too
often
fails
to
realize
the
just
and
legitimate
expectations
and
ideals
of
women
if
women
confide
themselves
body
and
soul
less
to
him
than
he
desires
it
is
not
she
but
he
who
is
often
chiefly
to
blame
indeed
in
some
psychic
respects
it
seems
as
if
in
human
society
the
processes
of
subordinating
the
male
to
the
female
carried
so
far
in
some
of
the
animal
species
had
already
begun
if
he
is
not
worshiped
as
formerly
it
is
because
he
is
less
worshipful
or
more
effeminate
less
vigorous
and
less
able
to
excite
and
retain
the
great
love
of
true
not
to
say
great
women
where
marriage
and
maternity
are
of
less
supreme
interest
to
an
increasing
number
of
women
there
are
various
results
the
chief
of
which
are
as
follows
women
grow
dollish
sink
more
or
less
consciously
to
man
level
gratify
his
desires
and
even
his
selfish
caprices
but
exact
in
return
luxury
and
display
growing
vain
as
he
grows
sordid
thus
while
submitting
conquering
and
tyrannizing
over
him
content
with
present
worldly
pleasure
unmindful
of
the
past
the
future
or
the
above
this
may
react
to
intersexual
antagonism
until
man
comes
to
hate
woman
as
a
witch
or
as
in
the
days
of
celibacy
consider
sex
a
wile
of
the
devil
along
these
lines
even
the
stage
is
beginning
to
represent
the
tragedies
of
life
the
disappointed
woman
in
whom
something
is
dying
comes
to
assert
her
own
ego
and
more
or
less
consciously
to
make
it
an
end
aiming
to
possess
and
realize
herself
fully
rather
than
to
transmit
despairing
of
herself
as
a
woman
she
asserts
her
lower
rights
in
the
place
of
her
one
great
right
to
be
loved
the
desire
for
love
may
be
transmuted
into
the
desire
for
knowledge
or
outward
achievement
become
a
substitute
for
inner
content
failing
to
respect
herself
as
a
productive
organism
she
gives
vent
to
personal
solutions
seeks
independence
comes
to
know
very
plainly
what
she
wants
perhaps
becomes
intellectually
emancipated
and
substitutes
science
for
religion
or
the
doctor
for
the
priest
with
the
impressionability
characteristic
of
her
sex
which
when
cultivated
is
so
like
an
awakened
child
she
perhaps
even
affects
mannish
ways
unconsciously
copying
from
those
not
most
manly
or
comes
to
feel
that
she
has
been
robbed
of
something
competes
with
men
but
sometimes
where
they
are
most
sordid
brutish
and
strongest
always
expecting
but
never
finding
she
turns
successively
to
art
science
literature
and
reforms
craves
especially
work
that
she
can
not
do
and
seeks
stimuli
for
feelings
which
have
never
found
their
legitimate
expression
another
type
truer
to
woman
nature
subordinates
self
goes
beyond
personal
happiness
adopts
the
motto
of
enters
a
life
of
service
denial
and
perhaps
mortification
like
the
countess
schimmelmann
and
perhaps
becomes
a
devotee
a
saint
and
if
need
be
a
martyr
but
all
with
modesty
humility
and
with
a
shrinking
from
publicity
in
our
civilization
i
believe
that
bright
girls
of
good
environment
of
eighteen
or
nineteen
or
even
seventeen
have
already
reached
the
peculiar
stage
of
first
maturity
when
they
see
the
world
at
first
hand
when
the
senses
are
at
their
very
best
their
susceptibilities
and
their
insights
the
keenest
tension
at
its
highest
plasticity
and
interests
most
developed
and
their
whole
psychic
soil
richest
and
rankest
and
sprouting
everywhere
with
the
tender
shoots
of
everything
both
good
and
bad
some
such
stella
klive
mary
maclane
hilma
strandberg
marie
bashkirtseff
have
been
veritable
epics
upon
woman
nature
have
revealed
the
characterlessness
normal
to
the
prenubile
period
in
which
everything
is
kept
tentative
and
plastic
and
where
life
seems
to
have
least
unity
aim
or
purpose
by
and
by
perhaps
they
will
see
in
all
their
scrappy
past
if
not
order
and
coherence
a
justification
and
then
alone
will
they
realize
that
life
is
governed
by
motives
deeper
than
those
which
are
conscious
or
even
personal
this
is
the
age
when
if
ever
no
girl
should
be
compelled
it
is
the
experiences
of
this
age
never
entirely
obliterated
in
women
that
enable
them
to
take
adolescent
boys
seriously
as
men
can
rarely
do
in
whom
these
experiences
are
more
limited
in
range
though
no
less
intense
it
is
this
stage
in
woman
which
is
most
unintelligible
to
man
and
even
unrealized
to
herself
it
is
the
echoes
from
it
that
make
vast
numbers
of
mothers
pursue
the
various
branches
of
culture
often
half
secretly
to
maintain
their
position
with
their
college
sons
and
daughters
with
their
husbands
or
with
society
but
in
a
very
few
years
i
believe
even
in
the
early
twenties
with
american
girls
along
with
rapidly
in
creasing
development
of
capacity
there
is
also
observable
the
beginnings
of
loss
and
deterioration
unless
marriage
comes
there
is
lassitude
subtle
symptoms
of
invalidism
the
germs
of
a
rather
aimless
dissatisfaction
with
life
a
little
less
interest
curiosity
and
courage
certain
forms
of
the
resolution
to
be
happy
though
at
too
great
cost
and
thus
the
clear
air
of
morning
begins
to
haze
over
and
unconsciously
she
begins
to
grope
by
thirty
she
is
perhaps
goaded
into
more
or
less
sourness
has
developed
more
petty
has
come
to
feel
a
right
to
happiness
almost
as
passionately
as
the
men
of
the
french
revolution
and
as
the
women
in
their
late
movement
for
enfranchisement
felt
for
liberty
very
likely
she
has
turned
to
other
women
and
entered
into
innocent
platonic
relations
with
some
one
there
is
a
little
more
affectation
playing
a
rôle
and
interest
in
dress
and
appearance
is
either
less
or
more
specialized
and
definite
perhaps
she
has
already
begun
to
be
a
seeker
who
will
perhaps
find
lose
and
seek
again
her
temper
is
modified
there
is
a
slight
stagnation
of
soul
a
craving
for
work
or
travel
a
love
of
children
with
flitting
thoughts
of
adopting
one
or
else
aversion
to
them
an
analysis
of
psychic
processes
until
they
are
weakened
and
insight
becomes
too
clear
sense
of
responsibility
without
an
object
a
slight
general
and
a
sense
that
society
is
a
false
margarine
affair
revolt
against
those
that
insist
that
in
her
child
the
real
value
of
a
woman
is
revealed
there
are
alternations
between
excessive
which
demands
something
almost
like
adoration
of
the
other
sex
and
with
it
may
be
many
dreameries
about
forbidden
subjects
and
about
the
relations
of
the
sexes
generally
a
new
danger
the
greatest
in
the
history
of
her
sex
now
impends
arrest
complacency
and
a
sense
of
finality
in
the
most
perilous
first
stage
of
higher
education
for
girls
when
after
all
little
has
actually
yet
been
won
save
only
the
right
and
opportunity
to
begin
reconstructions
so
that
now
for
the
first
time
in
history
methods
and
matter
could
be
radically
transformed
to
fit
the
nature
and
needs
of
girls
now
most
female
faculties
trustees
and
students
are
content
to
ape
the
newest
departures
in
some
one
or
more
male
institutions
as
far
as
their
means
or
obvious
limitations
make
possible
with
a
servility
which
is
often
abject
and
with
rarely
ever
a
thought
of
any
adjustment
save
the
most
superficial
to
sex
it
is
the
easiest
and
therefore
the
most
common
view
typically
expressed
by
the
female
head
of
a
very
successful
institution
who
was
early
convinced
in
my
teaching
experience
that
the
methods
for
mental
development
for
boys
and
girls
applied
equally
without
regard
to
sex
and
i
have
carried
the
same
thought
when
i
began
to
develop
the
physical
and
filled
my
gymnasium
with
the
ordinary
appliances
used
in
men
gymnasia
there
is
no
sex
in
mind
or
in
science
it
is
said
but
it
might
as
well
be
urged
that
there
is
no
age
and
hence
that
all
methods
adapted
to
teaching
at
different
stages
of
development
may
be
ignored
that
woman
can
do
many
things
as
well
as
man
does
not
prove
that
she
ought
to
do
the
same
things
or
that
ways
are
the
best
for
her
alice
freeman
palmer
was
right
in
saying
that
woman
education
has
all
the
perplexities
of
that
of
man
and
many
more
still
more
difficult
and
intricate
of
its
own
hence
we
must
conclude
that
while
women
colleges
have
to
a
great
extent
solved
the
problem
of
special
technical
training
they
have
done
as
yet
very
little
to
solve
the
larger
one
of
the
proper
education
of
woman
to
assume
that
the
latter
question
is
settled
as
is
so
often
done
is
disastrous
i
have
forced
myself
to
go
through
many
elaborate
reports
of
meetings
where
female
education
was
discussed
by
those
supposed
to
be
competent
but
as
a
rule
not
without
rare
striking
exceptions
these
proceedings
are
smitten
with
the
same
sterile
and
complacent
artificiality
that
was
so
long
the
curse
of
woman
life
i
deem
it
almost
reprehensible
that
save
a
few
general
statistics
the
women
colleges
have
not
only
made
no
study
themselves
of
the
larger
problems
that
impend
but
have
often
maintained
a
repellent
attitude
toward
others
who
wished
to
do
so
no
one
that
i
know
of
connected
with
any
of
these
institutions
where
the
richest
material
is
going
to
waste
is
making
any
serious
and
competent
research
on
lines
calculated
to
bring
out
the
differences
between
the
sexes
and
those
in
authority
are
either
conservative
by
constitution
or
else
intimidated
because
public
opinion
is
still
liable
to
panics
if
discussion
here
becomes
scientific
and
fundamental
and
so
tend
to
keep
prudery
and
the
old
habit
of
ignoring
everything
that
pertains
to
sex
in
countenance
again
while
i
sympathize
profoundly
with
the
claim
of
woman
for
every
opportunity
which
she
can
fill
and
yield
to
none
in
appreciation
of
her
ability
i
insist
that
the
cardinal
defect
in
the
woman
college
is
that
it
is
based
upon
the
assumption
implied
and
often
expressed
if
not
almost
universally
acknowledged
that
girls
should
primarily
be
trained
to
independence
and
and
that
matrimony
and
motherhood
if
it
come
will
take
care
of
itself
or
as
some
even
urge
is
thus
best
provided
for
if
these
colleges
are
as
the
above
statistics
indicate
chiefly
devoted
to
the
training
of
those
who
do
not
marry
or
if
they
are
to
educate
for
celibacy
this
is
right
these
institutions
may
perhaps
come
to
be
training
stations
of
a
type
the
agamic
or
even
agenic
woman
be
she
nut
maid
old
or
young
nun
or
bachelor
woman
i
recognize
the
very
great
debt
the
world
owes
to
members
of
this
very
diverse
class
in
the
past
some
of
them
have
illustrated
the
very
highest
ideals
of
service
and
devotion
in
giving
to
mankind
what
was
meant
for
husband
and
children
some
of
them
belong
to
the
class
of
superfluous
women
and
others
illustrate
the
noblest
type
of
altruism
and
have
impoverished
the
heredity
of
the
world
to
its
loss
as
did
the
monks
who
leslie
stephens
thinks
contributed
to
bring
about
the
dark
ages
because
they
were
the
best
and
most
highly
selected
men
of
their
age
and
by
withdrawing
from
the
function
of
heredity
and
leaving
no
posterity
caused
europe
to
degenerate
modern
ideas
and
training
are
now
doing
this
whether
for
racial
weal
or
woe
can
not
yet
be
determined
for
many
whom
nature
designed
for
model
mothers
the
bachelor
woman
is
an
interesting
illustration
of
spencer
law
of
the
inverse
relation
of
individuation
and
genesis
the
completely
developed
individual
is
always
a
terminal
representative
in
her
line
of
descent
she
has
taken
up
and
utilized
in
her
own
life
all
that
was
meant
for
her
descendants
and
has
so
overdrawn
her
account
with
heredity
that
like
every
perfectly
and
completely
developed
individual
she
is
also
completely
sterile
this
is
the
very
apotheosis
of
selfishness
from
the
standpoint
of
every
biological
ethics
while
the
complete
man
can
do
and
sometimes
does
this
woman
has
a
far
greater
and
very
peculiar
power
of
overdrawing
her
reserves
first
she
loses
mammary
functions
so
that
should
she
undertake
maternity
its
functions
are
incompletely
performed
because
she
can
not
nurse
and
this
implies
defective
motherhood
and
leaves
love
of
the
child
itself
defective
and
maimed
for
the
mother
who
has
never
nursed
can
not
love
or
be
loved
aright
by
her
child
it
crops
out
again
in
the
abnormal
or
especially
incomplete
development
of
her
offspring
in
the
critical
years
of
adolescence
although
they
may
have
been
healthful
before
and
a
less
degree
of
it
perhaps
is
seen
in
the
diminishing
families
of
cultivated
mothers
in
the
system
these
women
are
the
intellectual
equals
and
often
the
superiors
of
the
men
they
meet
they
are
very
attractive
as
companions
like
miss
mehr
the
university
student
in
hauptmann
lonely
lives
who
alienated
the
young
husband
from
his
noble
wife
they
enjoy
all
the
keen
pleasures
of
intellectual
activity
their
very
look
step
and
bearing
is
free
their
mentality
makes
them
good
fellows
and
companionable
in
all
the
broad
intellectual
spheres
to
converse
with
them
is
as
charming
and
attractive
for
the
best
men
as
was
socrates
discourse
with
the
accomplished
hetaerae
they
are
at
home
with
the
racquet
and
on
the
golf
links
they
are
splendid
friends
their
minds
in
all
their
widening
areas
of
contact
are
as
attractive
as
their
bodies
and
the
world
owes
much
and
is
likely
to
owe
far
more
to
high
platonic
friendships
of
this
kind
these
women
are
often
in
every
way
magnificent
only
they
are
not
mothers
and
sometimes
have
very
little
wifehood
in
them
and
to
attempt
to
marry
them
to
develop
these
functions
is
one
of
the
unique
and
too
frequent
tragedies
of
modern
life
and
literature
some
though
by
no
means
all
of
them
are
functionally
castrated
some
actively
deplore
the
necessity
of
and
perhaps
are
parturition
phobiacs
and
abhor
the
limitations
of
married
life
they
are
incensed
whenever
attention
is
called
to
the
functions
peculiar
to
their
sex
and
the
careful
consideration
of
problems
of
the
monthly
rest
are
thought
not
fit
for
cultivated
women
the
slow
evolution
of
this
type
is
probably
inevitable
as
civilization
advances
and
their
training
is
a
noble
function
already
it
has
produced
minds
of
the
greatest
acumen
who
have
made
very
valuable
contributions
to
science
and
far
more
is
to
be
expected
of
them
in
the
future
indeed
it
may
be
their
noble
function
to
lead
their
sex
out
into
the
higher
larger
life
and
the
deeper
sense
of
its
true
position
and
function
for
which
i
plead
hitherto
woman
has
not
been
able
to
solve
her
own
problems
while
she
has
been
more
religious
than
man
there
have
been
few
great
women
preachers
while
she
has
excelled
in
teaching
young
children
there
have
been
few
pestalozzis
or
even
froebels
while
her
invalidism
is
a
complex
problem
she
has
turned
to
man
in
her
diseases
this
is
due
to
the
very
intuitiveness
and
naïveté
of
her
nature
but
now
that
her
world
is
so
rapidly
widening
she
is
in
danger
of
losing
her
cue
she
must
be
studied
objectively
and
laboriously
as
we
study
children
and
partly
by
men
because
their
sex
must
of
necessity
always
remain
objective
and
incommensurate
with
regard
to
woman
and
therefore
more
or
less
theoretical
again
in
these
days
of
intense
new
interest
in
feelings
emotions
and
sentiments
when
many
a
psychologist
now
envies
and
like
schleiermacher
devoutly
wishes
he
could
become
a
woman
he
can
never
really
understand
the
eternal
womanly
one
of
the
two
supreme
oracles
of
guidance
in
life
because
he
is
a
man
and
here
the
cultivated
woman
must
explore
the
nature
of
her
sex
as
man
can
not
and
become
its
mouthpiece
in
many
of
the
new
fields
opening
in
biology
since
darwin
in
embryology
botany
the
study
of
children
animals
savages
witness
miss
fletcher
sociological
investigation
to
say
nothing
of
all
the
vast
body
of
work
that
requires
painstaking
detail
perseverance
and
conscience
woman
has
superior
ability
or
her
very
sex
gives
her
peculiar
advantages
where
she
is
to
lead
and
achieve
great
things
in
enlarging
the
kingdom
of
man
perhaps
too
the
present
training
of
women
may
in
the
end
develop
those
who
shall
one
day
attain
a
true
and
lead
n
the
next
step
of
devising
a
scheme
that
shall
fit
woman
nature
and
needs
for
the
slow
evolution
of
such
a
scheme
we
must
first
of
all
distinctly
and
ostensively
invert
the
present
maxim
and
educate
primarily
and
chiefly
for
motherhood
assuming
that
if
that
does
not
come
single
life
can
best
take
care
of
itself
because
it
is
less
intricate
and
lower
and
its
needs
far
more
easily
met
while
girls
may
be
trained
with
boys
coeducation
should
cease
at
the
dawn
of
adolescence
at
least
for
a
season
great
daily
intimacy
between
the
sexes
in
high
school
if
not
in
college
tends
to
rub
of
the
bloom
and
delicacy
which
can
develop
in
each
and
girls
suffer
in
this
respect
let
us
repeat
far
more
than
boys
the
familiar
comradeship
that
ignores
sex
should
be
left
to
the
agenic
class
to
the
care
of
their
institutions
we
leave
with
pious
and
reverent
hands
the
ideals
inspired
by
characters
like
hypatia
madame
de
staël
the
misses
cobb
martineau
fuller
bronté
by
george
eliot
george
sand
and
browning
and
while
accepting
and
profiting
by
what
they
have
done
and
acknowledging
every
claim
for
their
abilities
and
achievements
prospective
mothers
must
not
be
allowed
to
forget
a
still
larger
class
of
ideal
women
both
in
history
and
literature
from
the
holy
mother
to
beatrice
clotilda
de
vaux
and
all
those
who
have
inspired
men
to
great
deeds
and
the
choice
and
far
richer
anthology
of
noble
mothers
we
must
premise
too
that
she
must
not
be
petted
or
pampered
with
regimen
or
diet
unsuited
to
her
needs
left
to
find
out
as
best
she
can
from
surreptitious
or
worthy
sources
what
she
most
of
all
needs
to
know
must
recognize
that
our
present
civilization
is
hard
on
woman
and
that
she
is
not
yet
adjusted
to
her
social
environment
that
as
she
was
of
old
accused
of
having
given
man
the
apple
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
so
he
now
is
liable
to
a
perhaps
no
less
serious
indictment
of
having
given
her
the
apple
of
intellectualism
and
encouraged
her
to
assume
his
standards
at
the
expense
of
health
we
must
recognize
that
riches
are
probably
harder
on
her
on
the
whole
than
poverty
and
that
poor
parents
should
not
labor
too
hard
to
exempt
her
from
its
wholesome
discipline
the
expectancy
of
change
so
stamped
upon
her
sex
by
heredity
as
she
advances
into
maturity
must
not
be
perverted
into
uneasiness
or
her
soul
sown
with
the
tares
of
ambition
or
fired
by
intersexual
competition
and
driven
on
to
quote
edes
by
a
tireless
sort
of
energy
which
is
a
compound
of
conscience
ambition
and
desire
to
please
plus
a
peculiar
female
obstinacy
if
she
is
bright
she
must
not
be
overworked
in
the
school
factory
studying
in
a
way
which
parodies
hood
song
of
the
shirt
and
if
dull
or
feeble
she
should
not
be
worried
by
preceptresses
like
a
eminent
lady
principal
who
thought
girls
weakness
is
usually
imaginary
or
laziness
and
that
doctors
are
to
blame
for
suggesting
illness
and
for
intimating
that
men
will
have
to
choose
between
a
healthy
animal
and
an
educated
invalid
for
a
wife
without
specifying
here
details
or
curricula
the
ideals
that
should
be
striven
toward
in
the
intermediate
and
collegiate
education
of
adolescent
girls
with
the
proper
presupposition
of
motherhood
and
which
are
already
just
as
practicable
as
abbotsholme
or
des
may
be
rudely
indicated
somewhat
as
follows
first
the
ideal
institution
for
the
training
of
girls
from
twelve
or
thirteen
on
into
the
twenties
when
the
period
most
favorable
to
motherhood
begins
should
be
in
the
country
in
the
midst
of
hills
the
climbing
of
which
is
the
best
stimulus
for
heart
and
lungs
and
tends
to
mental
elevation
and
breadth
of
view
there
should
be
water
for
boating
bathing
and
skating
aquaria
and
aquatic
life
gardens
both
for
kitchen
vegetables
and
horticulture
forests
for
their
seclusion
and
religious
awe
good
roads
walks
and
paths
that
tempt
to
walking
and
wheeling
playgrounds
and
space
for
golf
and
tennis
with
large
covered
but
unheated
space
favorable
for
recreations
in
weather
really
too
bad
for
life
and
for
those
indisposed
and
plenty
of
nooks
that
permit
each
to
be
alone
with
nature
for
this
develops
inwardness
poise
and
character
yet
not
too
great
remoteness
from
the
city
for
a
wise
utilization
of
its
advantages
at
intervals
all
that
can
be
called

is
even
more
important
for

it
is

momentous
word
that

up
beside
holiness
to
which
it
is
etymologically
akin
the
new

of

last
few
years

be
supreme
and
make
these
academic
areas
soared
to
the
cult
of

only
those
who
realize

in

gymnasia
introduced

and
every
possible
adjustment
made
to

free
plays

should
always
have
precedence
over

should

with
the
competition

sedulously
reduced
and
with
dancing
of
many
kinds
and
forms
the
most
prominent
of
indoor
exercises
the
dance
cadences
the
soul
the
stately
minuet
gives
poise
the
figure
dances
train
the
mind
and
pantomime
and
dramatic
features
should
be
introduced
and
even
specialties
if
there
are
strong
individual
predispositions
the
history
of
the
dance
which
has
often
been
a
mode
of
worship
a
school
of
morals
and
which
is
the
root
of
the
best
that
is
in
the
drama
the
best
of
all
exercises
and
that
could
be
again
the
heart
of
our
whole
educational
system
should
be
exploited
and
the
dancing
school
and
class
rescued
from
its
present
degradation
no
girl
is
educated
who
can
not
dance
although
she
need
not
know
the
ballroom
in
its
modern
form
manners
a
word
too
often
relegated
to
the
past
as
savoring
of
the
primness
of
the
ancient
dame
school
or
female
seminary
are
really
minor
or
sometimes
major
morals
they
can
express
everything
in
the
whole
range
of
the
impulsive
or
emotional
life
now
that
we
understand
the
primacy
of
movement
over
feeling
we
can
appreciate
what
a
school
of
bearing
and
repose
in
daily
converse
with
others
means
i
would
revive
some
of
the
ancient
casuistry
of
details
but
less
the
rules
of
the
call
and
party
although
these
should
not
be
neglected
than
the
deeper
expressions
of
true
ladyhood
seen
in
an
exquisite
tender
and
unselfish
regard
for
the
feelings
of
others
women
ideal
of
compelling
every
one
whom
they
meet
to
like
them
is
a
noble
one
and
the
control
of
every
automatism
is
not
only
a
part
of
good
breeding
but
nervous
health
regularity
should
be
another
norm
in
the
main
even
though
he
may
have
played
his
sex
symphony
too
harshly
clark
was
right
periodicity
perhaps
the
deepest
law
of
the
cosmos
celebrates
its
highest
triumphs
in
woman
life
for
years
everything
must
give
way
to
its
thorough
and
settled
establishment
in
the
monthly
sabbaths
of
rest
the
ideal
school
should
revert
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
leisure
the
paradise
of
stated
rest
should
be
revisited
idleness
be
actively
cultivated
reverie
in
which
the
soul
which
needs
these
seasons
of
withdrawal
for
its
own
development
expatiates
over
the
whole
life
of
the
race
should
be
provided
for
and
encouraged
in
every
legitimate
way
for
in
rest
the
whole
momentum
of
heredity
is
felt
in
ways
most
favorable
to
full
and
complete
development
then
woman
should
realize
that
is
greater
than
should
step
reverently
aside
from
her
daily
routine
and
let
lord
nature
work
in
this
time
of
sensitiveness
and
perturbation
when
anemia
and
chlorosis
are
so
peculiarly
immanent
to
her
sex
remission
of
toil
should
not
only
be
permitted
but
required
and
yet
the
greatest
individual
liberty
should
be
allowed
to
adjust
itself
to
the
vast
diversities
of
individual
constitutional
needs
see
chapter
vii
on
this
point
the
cottage
home
which
should
take
the
place
of
the
dormitory
should
always
have
special
interest
and
attractions
for
these
seasons
there
should
always
be
some
personal
instruction
at
these
seasons
during
earlier
adolescent
years
i
have
glanced
over
nearly
a
score
of
books
and
pamphlets
that
are
especially
written
for
girls
while
all
are
well
meant
and
far
better
than
the
ordinary
modes
by
which
girls
acquire
knowledge
of
their
own
nature
if
left
to
themselves
they
are
like
books
for
boys
far
too
prolix
and
most
are
too
scientific
and
plain
and
direct
moreover
no
two
girls
need
just
the
same
instruction
and
to
leave
it
to
reading
is
too
indirect
and
causes
the
mind
to
dwell
on
it
for
too
long
periods
best
of
all
is
individual
instruction
at
the
time
concise
practical
and
never
especially
in
the
early
years
without
a
certain
mystic
and
religious
tone
which
should
pervade
all
and
make
everything
sacred
this
should
not
be
given
by
male
physicians
and
indeed
most
female
doctors
would
make
it
too
professional
and
the
maiden
teacher
must
forever
lack
reverence
for
it
but
it
should
come
from
one
whose
soul
and
body
are
full
of
wifehood
and
motherhood
and
who
is
old
enough
to
know
and
is
not
without
the
necessary
technical
knowledge
another
principle
should
be
to
broaden
by
retarding
to
keep
the
purely
mental
back
and
by
every
method
to
bring
the
intuitions
to
the
front
appeals
to
tact
and
taste
should
be
incessant
a
purely
intellectual
man
is
no
doubt
biologically
a
deformity
but
a
purely
intellectual
woman
is
far
more
so
bookishness
is
probably
a
bad
sign
in
a
girl
it
suggests
artificiality
pedantry
the
lugging
of
dead
knowledge
mere
learning
is
not
the
ideal
and
prodigies
of
scholarship
are
always
morbid
the
rule
should
be
to
keep
nothing
that
is
not
to
become
practical
to
open
no
brain
tracts
which
are
not
to
be
highways
for
the
daily
traffic
of
thought
and
conduct
not
to
overburden
the
soul
with
the
impedimenta
of
libraries
and
records
of
what
is
afar
off
in
time
or
zest
and
always
to
follow
truly
the
guidance
of
normal
and
spontaneous
interests
wisely
interpreted
religion
will
always
bold
as
prominent
a
place
in
woman
life
as
politics
does
in
man
and
adolescence
is
still
more
its
seedtime
with
girls
than
with
boys
its
roots
are
the
sentiment
of
awe
and
reverence
and
it
is
the
great
agent
in
the
world
for
transforming
life
from
its
earlier
selfish
to
its
only
really
mature
form
of
altruism
the
tales
of
the
heroes
of
virtue
duty
devotion
and
from
the
old
testament
come
naturally
first
then
perhaps
the
prophets
paraphrased
as
in
the
pedagogic
triumph
of
kent
and
saunders
little
series
and
when
adolescence
is
at
its
height
then
the
chief
stress
of
religious
instruction
should
be
laid
upon
jesus
life
and
work
he
should
be
taught
first
humanly
and
only
later
when
the
limitations
of
manhood
seem
exhausted
should
his
deity
be
adduced
as
welcome
surplusage
the
supernatural
is
a
reflex
of
the
heart
each
sustains
and
neither
can
exist
without
the
other
if
the
transcendent
and
supernal
had
no
objective
existence
we
should
have
to
invent
and
teach
it
or
dwarf
the
life
of
feeling
and
sentiment
whatever
else
religion
is
therefore
it
is
the
supremest
poetry
of
the
soul
reflecting
like
nothing
else
all
that
is
deepest
most
generic
and
racial
in
it
theology
should
be
reduced
to
a
minimum
but
nothing
denied
where
wanted
paul
and
his
works
and
ways
should
be
for
the
most
part
deferred
until
after
eighteen
the
juvenile
well
as
the
cyclone
revivalist
should
be
very
carefully
excluded
and
yet
in
every
springtime
when
nature
is
recreated
service
and
teaching
should
gently
encourage
the
revival
and
even
the
regeneration
of
all
the
religious
instincts
the
mission
recruiter
should
be
allowed
to
do
his
work
outside
these
halls
and
everything
in
the
way
of
infection
and
all
that
brings
religion
into
conflict
with
good
taste
and
good
sense
should
be
excluded
while
esthetics
should
supplement
reënforce
and
go
hand
in
hand
with
piety
religion
is
in
its
infancy
and
woman
who
has
sustained
it
in
the
past
must
be
the
chief
agent
in
its
further
and
higher
development
orthodoxies
and
all
narrowness
should
forever
give
place
to
cordial
hospitality
toward
every
serious
view
which
should
be
met
by
the
method
of
greater
sympathy
rather
than
by
that
of
criticism
nature
in
her
many
phases
should
of
course
make
up
a
large
part
of
the
entire
curriculum
but
here
again
the
methods
of
the
sexes
should
differ
somewhat
after
puberty
the
poetic
and
mythic
factors
and
some
glimpses
of
the
history
of
science
should
be
given
more
prominence
the
field
naturalist
rather
than
the
laboratory
man
of
technic
should
be
the
ideal
especially
at
first
nature
should
be
taught
as
first
revelation
as
an
old
testament
related
to
the
bible
as
a
primordial
dispensation
to
a
later
and
clearer
and
more
special
one
reverence
and
love
should
be
the
motive
powers
and
no
aspect
should
be
studied
without
beginning
and
culminating
in
interests
akin
to
devotion
mathematics
should
be
taught
only
in
its
rudiments
and
those
with
special
talents
or
tastes
for
it
should
go
to
agamic
schools
chemistry
too
although
not
excluded
should
have
a
subordinate
place
the
average
girl
has
little
love
of
sozzling
and
mussing
with
the
elements
and
cooking
involves
problems
in
organic
chemistry
too
complex
to
be
understood
very
profoundly
but
the
rudiments
of
household
chemistry
should
be
taught
physics
too
should
be
kept
to
elementary
stages
meteorology
should
have
a
larger
and
geology
and
astronomy
increasingly
larger
places
and
are
especially
valuable
because
and
largely
in
proportion
as
they
are
taught
out
of
doors
but
the
general
principles
and
the
untechnical
and
practical
aspects
should
be
kept
in
the
foreground
with
botany
more
serious
work
should
be
done
and
the
poetic
aspect
as
in
astronomy
should
have
attention
throughout
while
latin
nomenclature
and
microscopic
technic
should
come
late
if
at
all
and
vulgar
names
should
have
precedence
over
latin
terminology
flowers
gardening
and
excursions
should
never
be
wanting
economic
and
even
medical
aspects
should
appear
and
prominent
and
early
should
come
the
whole
matter
of
self
and
that
by
insects
the
moral
value
of
this
subject
will
never
be
fully
understood
till
we
have
what
might
almost
be
called
a
woman
botany
constructed
on
lines
different
from
any
of
the
i
have
glanced
at
here
much
knowledge
interesting
in
itself
can
be
early
taught
which
will
spring
up
into
a
world
of
serviceable
insights
as
adolescence
develops
and
the
great
law
of
sex
unfolds
zoology
should
always
be
taught
with
plenty
of
pets
menagerie
resources
and
with
aquaria
aviaries
apiaries
formicaries
as
adjuncts
it
should
start
in
the
environment
like
everything
else
bird
and
animal
lore
books
and
pictures
should
abound
in
the
early
stages
and
the
very
prolific
chapter
of
instincts
should
have
ample
illustration
while
the
morphological
nomenclature
and
details
of
structure
should
be
less
essential
woman
has
domesticated
nearly
all
the
animals
and
is
so
superior
to
man
in
insight
into
their
modes
of
life
and
psychoses
that
many
of
them
are
almost
exemplifications
of
moral
qualities
to
her
even
more
than
to
man
the
peacock
is
an
embodied
expression
of
pride
the
pig
of
filth
the
fox
of
cunning
the
serpent
of
subtle
danger
the
eagle
of
sublimity
the
goose
of
stupidity
and
so
on
through
all
the
range
of
human
qualities
as
we
have
seen
at
bottom
however
the
study
of
animal
life
is
coming
to
be
more
and
more
a
problem
of
heredity
and
its
problems
should
have
dominant
position
and
to
them
the
other
matter
should
grade
up
this
shades
over
into
and
prepares
for
the
study
of
the
primitive
man
and
child
so
closely
related
to
each
other
the
myth
custom
belief
domestic
practises
of
savages
vegetative
and
animal
traits
in
infancy
and
childhood
the
development
of
which
is
a
priceless
boon
for
the
higher
education
of
women
open
of
themselves
a
great
field
of
human
interest
where
she
needs
to
know
the
great
results
the
striking
details
the
salient
illustrations
the
basal
principles
rather
than
to
be
entangled
in
the
details
of
anthropometry
craniometry
philology
etc
all
this
lays
the
basis
for
a
larger
study
of
modern
man
history
with
the
biographical
element
very
prominent
throughout
with
plenty
of
stories
of
heroes
of
virtue
acts
of
valor
tales
of
saintly
lives
and
the
personal
element
more
prominent
and
specialization
in
the
study
of
dynasties
wars
authorities
and
controversies
relegated
to
a
very
subordinate
place
sociology
undeveloped
rudimentary
and
in
some
places
suspected
as
it
is
should
have
in
the
curriculum
of
her
higher
education
a
place
above
political
economy
the
stories
of
the
great
reforms
and
accounts
of
the
constitution
of
society
of
the
home
church
state
and
school
and
philanthropies
and
ideals
should
to
the
fore
art
in
all
its
forms
should
be
opened
at
least
in
a
propædeutic
way
and
individual
tastes
amply
and
judiciously
fed
but
there
should
be
no
special
training
in
music
without
some
taste
and
gift
and
the
aim
should
be
to
develop
critical
and
discriminative
appreciation
and
the
good
taste
that
sees
the
vast
superiority
of
all
that
is
good
and
classic
over
what
is
cheap
and
fustian
in
literature
myth
poetry
and
drama
should
perhaps
lead
and
the
knowledge
of
the
great
authors
in
the
vernacular
be
fostered
greek
hebrew
and
perhaps
latin
languages
should
be
entirely
excluded
not
but
that
they
are
of
great
value
and
have
their
place
but
because
a
smattering
knowledge
is
bought
at
too
high
a
price
of
ignorance
of
more
valuable
things
german
french
and
italian
should
be
allowed
and
provided
for
by
native
teachers
and
by
conversational
methods
if
desired
and
in
their
proper
season
in
the
studies
of
the
soul
of
man
generally
called
the
philosophic
branches
metaphysics
and
epistemology
should
have
the
smallest
and
logic
the
next
least
place
psychology
should
be
taught
on
the
genetic
basis
of
animals
and
children
and
one
of
its
should
be
developed
from
the
love
of
infancy
and
youth
than
which
nothing
in
all
the
world
is
more
worthy
if
a
woman
descartes
ever
arises
she
will
put
life
before
theory
and
her
watchword
will
be
not
ergo
i
think
therefore
i
am
but
ergo
i
am
therefore
i
think
the
psychology
of
sentiments
and
feelings
and
intuitions
will
take
precedence
of
that
of
pure
intellect
ethics
will
be
taught
on
the
basis
of
the
whole
series
of
practical
duties
and
problems
and
the
theories
of
the
ultimate
nature
of
right
or
the
constitution
of
conscience
will
have
small
place
domesticity
will
be
taught
by
example
in
some
ideal
home
building
by
a
kind
of
laboratory
method
a
nursery
with
all
carefully
selected
appliances
and
adjuncts
a
a
kitchen
bedroom
closets
cellars
outhouses
building
its
material
the
grounds
lawn
shrubbery
hothouse
library
and
all
the
other
adjuncts
of
the
hearth
will
be
both
exemplified
and
taught
a
general
course
in
pedagogy
especially
its
history
and
ideals
another
in
child
study
and
finally
a
course
in
maternity
the
last
year
taught
broadly
and
not
without
practical
details
of
nursing
should
be
comprehensive
and
culminating
in
its
largest
sense
maternity
might
be
the
heart
of
all
the
higher
training
of
young
women
applied
knowledge
will
thus
be
brought
to
a
focus
in
a
department
of
teaching
as
one
of
the
specialties
of
motherhood
and
not
as
a
vocation
apart
the
training
should
aim
to
develop
power
of
maternity
in
soul
as
well
as
in
body
so
that
home
influence
may
extend
on
and
up
through
the
plastic
years
of
pubescence
and
future
generations
shall
not
rebel
against
these
influences
until
they
have
wrought
their
perfect
work
the
methods
throughout
should
be
objective
with
copious
illustrations
by
way
of
apparatus
charts
pictures
diagrams
and
lectures
far
less
book
work
and
recitation
only
a
limited
amount
of
room
study
the
function
of
examination
reduced
to
a
minimum
and
everything
as
suggestive
and
germinal
as
possible
hints
that
are
not
followed
up
information
not
elaborated
into
a
thin
pedagogic
sillabub
or
froth
seed
that
is
sown
on
the
waters
with
no
thought
of
reaping
faith
in
a
god
who
does
not
pay
at
the
end
of
each
week
month
or
year
but
who
always
pays
abundantly
some
time
training
which
does
not
develop
hypertrophied
that
carry
or
creative
powers
that
discover
and
produce
these
are
lines
on
which
such
an
institution
should
develop
specialization
has
its
place
but
it
always
hurts
a
woman
soul
more
than
a
man
should
always
come
later
and
if
there
is
special
capacity
it
should
be
trained
elsewhere
unconscious
education
is
a
power
of
which
we
have
yet
to
learn
the
full
ranges
in
most
groups
in
this
series
of
ideal
departments
there
should
be
at
least
one
healthful
wise
honorable
married
and
attractive
man
and
if
possible
several
of
them
his
very
presence
in
an
institution
for
young
women
gives
poise
polarizes
the
soul
and
gives
wholesome
but
tension
at
root
no
doubt
sexual
but
all
unconsciously
so
this
mentor
should
not
be
more
father
than
brother
though
he
should
combine
the
best
of
each
but
should
add
another
element
he
need
not
be
a
doctor
a
clergyman
or
even
a
great
scholar
but
should
be
accessible
for
confidential
conferences
even
though
intimate
he
should
know
the
soul
of
the
adolescent
girl
and
how
to
prescribe
he
should
be
wise
and
fruitful
in
advice
but
especially
should
be
to
all
a
source
of
contagion
and
inspiration
for
poise
and
courage
even
though
religious
or
medical
problems
be
involved
but
even
if
he
lack
all
these
latter
qualities
though
he
so
poised
that
impulsive
girls
can
turn
their
hearts
inside
out
in
his
presence
and
perhaps
even
weep
on
his
shoulder
the
presence
of
such
a
being
though
a
complete
realization
of
this
ideal
could
be
only
remotely
approximated
would
be
the
center
of
an
atmosphere
most
wholesomely
tonic
in
these
all
too
meager
outlines
i
have
sketched
a
humanistic
and
liberal
education
and
have
refrained
from
all
details
and
special
curriculization
many
of
the
above
features
i
believe
would
be
as
helpful
for
boys
as
for
girls
but
woman
has
here
an
opportunity
to
resume
her
exalted
and
supreme
position
to
be
the
first
in
this
higher
field
to
lead
man
and
pay
her
debt
to
his
educational
institutions
by
resuming
her
crown
the
ideal
institutions
however
for
the
two
will
always
be
radically
and
probably
always
increasingly
divergent
as
a
psychologist
penetrated
with
the
growing
sense
of
the
predominance
of
the
heart
over
the
mere
intellect
i
believe
myself
not
alone
in
desiring
to
make
a
tender
declaration
of
being
more
and
more
passionately
in
love
with
woman
as
i
conceive
she
came
from
the
hand
of
god
i
keenly
envy
my
catholic
friends
their
maryolatry
who
ever
asked
if
the
holy
mother
whom
the
wise
men
adored
knew
the
astronomy
of
the
chaldees
or
had
studied
egyptian
or
babylonian
or
even
whether
she
knew
how
to
read
or
write
her
own
tongue
and
who
has
ever
thought
of
caring
we
can
not
conceive
that
she
bemoaned
any
limitations
of
her
sex
but
she
has
been
an
object
of
adoration
all
these
centuries
because
she
glorified
womanhood
by
being
more
generic
nearer
the
race
and
richer
in
love
pity
unselfish
devotion
and
intuition
than
man
the
glorified
madonna
ideal
shows
us
how
much
more
whole
and
holy
it
is
to
be
a
woman
than
to
be
artist
orator
professor
or
expert
and
suggests
to
our
own
sex
that
to
be
a
man
is
larger
than
to
be
gentleman
philosopher
general
president
or
millionaire
but
with
all
this
love
and
hunger
in
my
heart
i
can
not
help
sharing
in
the
growing
fear
that
modern
woman
at
least
in
more
ways
and
places
than
one
is
in
danger
of
declining
from
her
orbit
that
she
is
coming
to
lack
just
confidence
and
pride
in
her
sex
as
such
and
is
just
now
in
danger
of
lapsing
to
mannish
ways
methods
and
ideals
until
her
original
divinity
may
become
obscured
but
if
our
worship
at
her
shrine
is
with
a
love
and
adoration
a
little
qualified
and
unsteady
we
have
a
fixed
and
abiding
faith
without
which
we
should
have
no
resource
against
pessimism
for
the
future
of
our
race
that
she
will
ere
long
evolve
a
sphere
of
life
and
even
education
which
fits
her
needs
as
well
as
if
not
better
than
those
of
man
fit
his
meanwhile
if
the
eternally
womanly
seems
somewhat
less
divine
we
can
turn
with
unabated
faith
to
the
eternally
childish
the
best
of
which
in
each
are
so
closely
related
the
oracles
of
infancy
and
childhood
will
never
fail
distracted
as
we
are
in
the
maze
of
new
sciences
skills
ideals
knowledges
that
we
can
not
fully
coördinate
by
our
logic
or
curriculize
by
our
pedagogy
confused
between
the
claims
of
old
and
new
methods
needing
desperately
for
survival
as
a
nation
and
a
race
some
clue
to
thrid
the
mazes
of
the
manifold
modern
cultures
we
have
now
at
least
one
source
to
which
we
can
turn
we
have
found
the
only
magnet
in
all
the
universe
that
points
steadfastly
to
the
undiscovered
pole
of
human
destiny
we
know
what
can
and
will
ultimately
coördinate
in
the
generic
which
is
larger
than
the
logical
order
all
that
is
worth
knowing
teaching
or
doing
by
the
best
methods
that
will
save
us
from
misfits
and
the
waste
ineffable
of
premature
and
belated
knowledge
and
that
is
in
the
interests
and
line
of
normal
development
in
the
child
in
our
midst
that
must
henceforth
ever
lead
us
which
epitomizes
in
its
development
all
the
stages
human
and
prehuman
that
is
the
proper
object
of
all
that
strange
new
love
of
everything
that
is
naive
spontaneous
and
unsophisticated
in
human
nature
the
heart
and
soul
of
growing
childhood
is
the
criterion
by
which
we
judge
the
larger
heart
and
soul
of
mature
womanhood
and
these
are
ultimately
the
only
guide
into
the
heart
of
the
new
education
which
is
to
be
when
the
school
becomes
what
melanchthon
said
it
must
be
a
true
workshop
of
the
holy
ghost
and
what
the
new
psychology
when
it
rises
to
the
heights
of
prophecy
foresees
as
the
true
paradise
of
restored
intuitive
human
nature

an

lately
in
substance
with
no
new
impression
from
without
and
one
constant
and
only
duty
is
a
schooling
in
perseverance
and
sustained
effort
such
as
few
boys
now
get
in
any
shape
while
city
instead
of
country
life
brings
so
many
new
heterogeneous
and
distracting
impressions
of
motion
rather
than
rest
and
so
many
privileges
with
so
few
corresponding
duties
that
with
artificial
life
and
bad
air
the
will
is
weakened
and
eupeptic
minds
and
stomachs
on
which
its
vigor
so
depends
are
rare
machines
supersede
muscles
and
perhaps
our
athleticism
gives
skill
too
great
preponderance
over
strength
or
favors
intense
rather
than
constant
unintermittent
energy
perhaps
too
many
of
our
courses
of
study
are
better
fitted
to
turn
out
but
superficial
paragraphists
than
men
who
can
lay
deep
plans
and
subordinate
many
complex
means
to
one
remote
end
meanwhile
if
there
is
any
one
thing
of
which
our
industries
and
practical
arts
are
in
more
crying
need
than
another
it
is
the
virtue
of
thoroughness
of
a
kind
and
degree
which
does
not
address
merely
the
eye
is
not
limited
by
the
letter
of
a
contract
but
which
has
some
regard
for
its
products
for
their
own
sake
and
some
sense
for
the
future
whether
in
science
philosophy
morals
or
business
the
fields
for
cumulative
efforts
are
wider
more
numerous
and
far
more
needy
than
in
the
days
when
it
was
the
fashion
for
men
contentedly
to
concentrate
themselves
to
one
vocation
or
mission
or
when
cathedrals
or
other
yet
vaster
public
works
were
transmitted
unfinished
but
ever
advancing
from
one
generation
of
men
to
another
it
is
because
the
brain
is
developed
while
the
muscles
are
allowed
to
grow
flabby
and
atrophied
that
the
deplored
chasm
between
knowing
and
doing
is
so
often
fatal
to
the
practical
effectiveness
of
mental
and
moral
culture
the
great
increase
of
city
and
sedentary
life
has
been
far
too
sudden
for
the
human
body
which
was
developed
by
hunting
war
agriculture
and
manifold
industries
now
given
over
to
steam
and
machinery
to
adapt
itself
healthfully
or
naturally
to
its
new
environment
let
any
of
us
take
down
an
anatomical
chart
of
the
human
muscles
and
reflect
what
movements
we
habitually
make
each
day
and
realize
how
disproportionately
our
activities
are
distributed
compared
with
the
size
or
importance
of
the
muscles
and
how
greatly
modern
specialization
of
work
has
deformed
our
bodies
the
muscles
that
move
the
scribbling
pen
are
insignificant
fraction
of
those
in
the
whole
body
and
those
that
wag
the
tongue
and
adjust
the
larynx
are
also
comparatively
few
and
small
their
importance
is
of
course
not
underrated
but
it
is
disastrous
to
concentrate
education
upon
them
too
exclusively
or
too
early
in
life
the
trouble
is
that
few
realize
what
physical
vigor
is
in
man
or
woman
or
how
dangerously
near
weakness
often
is
to
wickedness
how
impossible
healthful
energy
of
will
is
without
strong
muscles
which
are
its
organ
or
how
endurance
and
no
less
than
great
achievement
depend
on
both
in
germany
and
greece
a
golden
age
of
letters
was
preceded
by
about
a
generation
by
a
golden
age
of
national
gymnastic
enthusiasm
which
constitutes
especially
in
the
former
country
one
of
the
most
unique
and
suggestive
chapters
in
the
history
of
pedagogy
symmetry
and
grace
hardihood
and
courage
the
power
to
do
everything
that
the
human
body
can
do
with
and
without
all
conceivable
apparatus
instruments
and
even
tools
are
culture
ideals
that
in
greece
rome
and
germany
respectively
have
influenced
as
they
might
again
influence
young
men
as
intellectual
ideals
never
can
do
save
in
a
select
few
we
do
not
want
who
perform
feats
hard
to
learn
but
then
easy
to
do
and
good
for
show
nor
spurtiness
of
any
sort
which
develops
an
erethic
habit
of
work
temper
and
circulation
and
is
favored
by
some
of
our
popular
sports
but
too
soon
reacts
into
fatigue
even
does
not
reach
its
end
till
it
leads
the
young
up
to
taking
a
intelligent
serious
and
interest
in
their
own
physical
culture
and
development
this
is
higher
than
interest
in
success
in
school
or
college
sport
and
though
naturally
later
than
these
is
one
of
the
earliest
forms
of
in
which
it
is
safe
and
wise
to
attempt
to
interest
the
young
for
its
own
sake
alone
in
our
exciting
life
and
trying
climate
in
which
the
experiment
of
civilization
has
never
been
tried
before
these
thoughts
are
merely
exercises
but
this
is
of
course
preliminary
great
as
is
the
need
the
practical
difficulties
in
the
way
are
very
great
first
there
are
not
only
no
good
in
ethics
but
no
good
manual
to
guide
teachers
some
give
so
many
virtues
or
good
habits
to
be
taught
per
term
ignoring
the
unity
of
virtue
as
well
as
the
order
in
which
the
child
capacities
for
real
virtue
unfold
advanced
discuss
the
grounds
of
obligation
the
nature
of
choice
or
freedom
or
the
hedonistic
calculus
as
if
pleasures
and
pains
could
be
balanced
as
measurable
quantities
so
that
philosophic
morality
is
clearly
not
for
children
or
teachers
secondly
evolution
encourages
too
often
the
doubt
whether
virtue
can
be
taught
when
it
should
have
the
opposite
effect
perversity
and
viciousness
of
will
are
too
often
treated
as
constitutional
disease
and
insubordination
or
obstinacy
especially
in
school
are
secretly
admired
as
strength
instead
of
being
vigorously
treated
as
crampy
disorders
of
will
and
the
child
is
coddled
into
flaccidity
becomes
the
lowest
develops
first
there
is
danger
that
it
will
interfere
with
the
development
of
the
higher
and
thus
if
left
to
his
own
the
child
may
come
to
have
no
will
the
third
and
greatest
difficulty
is
that
with
the
best
effort
to
do
so
so
few
teachers
can
separate
morality
from
religious
creed
so
vital
is
the
religions
sentiment
here
that
it
is
hard
to
divorce
the
end
of
education
from
the
end
of
life
proximate
from
ultimate
grounds
of
obligation
or
finite
from
infinite
duties
those
whose
training
has
been
more
religious
than
ethical
can
hardly
teach
morality
satisfactorily
to
the
me
touch
me
not
spirit
of
denominational
freedom
so
wisely
jealous
of
conflicting
standards
and
sanctions
for
the
young
how
then
can
we
ever
hope
to
secure
proper
training
for
the
will
more
than
a
generation
ago
germany
developed
the
following
method
children
of
lutheran
catholic
and
jewish
parentage
which
include
most
german
children
were
allowed
one
afternoon
a
week
for
several
years
and
two
afternoons
a
week
for
a
few
months
preceding
confirmation
to
spend
half
of
a
school
day
with
instructors
of
these
respective
professions
who
were
nominated
by
the
church
but
examined
by
the
state
as
to
their
competence
these
teachers
are
as
professional
therefore
as
those
in
the
regular
class
work
each
religion
is
allowed
to
determine
its
own
course
of
religious
instruction
subject
only
to
the
approval
of
the
cultus
minister
or
the
local
authorities
in
this
way
a
rupture
between
the
religious
sentiments
and
teaching
of
successive
generations
is
avoided
and
it
is
sought
to
bring
religious
training
to
bear
upon
morals
these
classes
learn
scripture
hymns
church
service
the
catholics
in
latin
and
the
jewish
in
hebrew
the
history
of
their
church
and
people
and
sometimes
a
little
systematic
theology
in
some
of
these
schools
there
are
prizes
and
diplomas
and
the
spirit
of
competition
is
appealed
to
a
criticism
sometimes
made
against
them
especially
against
the
lutheran
religious
pedagogy
is
that
it
is
too
intellectual
it
is
of
course
far
more
systematic
and
effective
from
this
point
of
view
than
the
american
sunday
school
so
that
whatever
may
be
said
of
its
edifying
effects
the
german
child
knows
these
topics
far
better
than
the
american
this
system
with
modifications
has
been
adopted
in
some
places
in
france
england
and
in
america
more
often
in
private
than
in
public
schools
however
the
other
system
originated
in
france
some
years
after
the
war
when
the
clerical
influence
in
french
education
gave
way
to
the
lay
and
secular
spirit
in
these
classes
for
which
also
stated
times
are
set
apart
and
which
are
continued
through
all
the
required
grades
under
the
name
of
moral
and
civic
instruction
the
religious
element
is
entirely
absent
except
that
there
are
a
few
hymns
bible
passages
and
stories
which
all
agree
upon
as
valuable
most
of
the
course
is
made
up
of
carefully
selected
maxims
and
especially
stories
of
virtue
records
of
heroic
achievements
in
french
history
and
even
in
literature
and
the
drama
everything
however
has
a
distinct
moral
lesson
although
that
lesson
is
not
made
offensively
prominent
we
have
here
nearly
a
score
of
these
textbooks
large
and
small
it
would
seen
as
though
the
resources
of
the
french
records
and
literature
had
been
ransacked
and
indeed
many
deeds
of
heroism
are
culled
from
the
daily
press
the
matter
is
often
arranged
under
headings
such
as
cleanliness
acts
of
kindness
courage
truthfulness
versus
lying
respect
for
age
good
manners
etc
each
virtue
is
thus
taught
in
a
way
appropriate
to
each
stage
of
childhood
and
quite
often
bands
of
mercy
rescue
leagues
and
other
societies
are
the
outgrowth
of
this
instruction
it
is
of
course
exposed
to
much
criticism
from
the
clergy
on
the
cogent
ground
that
morality
needs
the
support
of
religion
at
the
very
least
in
childhood
this
system
has
had
much
influence
in
england
where
several
similar
courses
have
been
evolved
and
in
this
country
we
have
at
least
one
very
praiseworthy
effort
in
this
direction
addressed
mainly
however
to
older
children
besides
this
two
ways
suggest
themselves
first
we
may
try
to
assume
or
tediously
enucleate
a
consensus
of
religious
truth
as
a
basis
of
will
training
god
and
immortality
and
ignoring
the
minority
who
doubt
these
vote
them
into
the
public
school
pedagogy
need
have
nothing
whatever
to
say
respecting
the
absolute
truth
or
falsity
of
these
ideas
but
there
is
little
doubt
that
they
have
an
influence
on
the
will
at
a
certain
stage
of
average
development
greater
and
more
essential
than
any
other
so
great
that
even
were
their
vitality
to
decay
like
the
faith
in
the
greek
or
german
mythology
we
should
still
have
to
teach
god
and
a
future
life
as
the
most
imperative
of
all
hypotheses
in
a
field
where
as
in
morals
nothing
is
so
practical
as
a
good
theory
and
we
should
have
to
fall
to
teaching
the
bible
as
a
moral
classic
and
cultivate
a
critical
sympathy
for
its
view
of
life
but
this
way
ignores
revelation
and
supernatural
claims
while
some
have
other
objections
to
emancipating
or
rescuing
the
bible
from
theology
just
yet
indeed
the
problem
how
to
teach
anything
that
the
mind
could
not
have
found
out
for
itself
but
that
had
to
be
revealed
has
not
been
solved
by
modern
pedagogy
which
since
pestalozzi
has
been
more
and
more
devoted
to
natural
and
developing
methods
the
latter
teaches
that
there
must
not
be
too
much
seed
sown
too
much
or
too
high
precept
or
too
much
iteration
and
that
in
jean
paul
phrase
the
hammer
must
not
rest
on
bell
but
only
tap
and
rebound
to
bring
out
a
clear
tone
again
a
consensus
of
this
content
would
either
have
to
be
carefully
defined
and
would
be
too
generic
and
abstract
for
school
uses
or
else
differences
of
interpretation
which
so
pervade
and
are
modified
by
character
culture
temperament
and
feeling
would
make
the
consensus
itself
nugatory
religious
training
must
be
specific
at
first
and
omitting
qualifications
the
more
explicit
the
denominational
faith
the
earlier
may
religious
motives
affect
the
will
this
is
the
way
of
our
hopes
to
the
closer
consideration
of
which
we
intend
to
return
in
the
future
though
it
must
be
expected
that
the
happiest
consensus
will
be
long
quarantined
from
most
schools
meanwhile
a
second
way
however
unpromising
is
still
open
noble
types
of
character
may
rest
on
only
the
native
instincts
of
the
soul
or
even
on
broadly
interpreted
utilitarian
considerations
but
if
morality
without
religion
were
only
a
bloodless
corpse
or
a
plank
in
a
shipwreck
there
is
now
need
enough
for
teachers
to
study
its
form
drift
and
uses
by
itself
alone
this
at
least
is
our
purpose
in
considering
the
will
and
this
only
the
will
purpose
and
even
mood
of
small
children
when
alone
are
fickle
fluctuating
contradictory
our
very
presence
imposes
one
general
law
on
them
that
of
keeping
our
good
will
and
avoiding
our
displeasure
as
the
plant
grows
towards
the
light
so
they
unfold
in
the
direction
of
our
wishes
felt
as
by
divination
they
respect
all
you
smile
at
even
buffoonery
look
up
in
their
play
to
call
your
notice
to
study
the
lines
of
your
sympathy
as
if
their
chief
vocation
was
to
learn
your
desires
their
early
lies
are
often
saying
what
they
think
will
please
us
knowing
no
higher
touchstones
of
truth
if
we
are
careful
to
be
wisely
and
without
excess
happy
and
affectionate
when
they
are
good
and
saddened
and
slightly
cooled
in
manifestations
of
love
if
they
do
wrong
the
power
of
association
in
the
normal
eupeptic
child
will
early
choose
right
as
surely
as
pleasure
increases
vitality
if
our
love
is
deep
obedience
is
an
instinct
if
not
a
religion
the
child
learns
that
while
it
can
not
excite
our
fear
resentment
or
admiration
it
can
act
on
our
love
and
this
should
be
the
first
sense
of
its
own
efficiency
thus
too
it
first
learns
that
the
way
of
passion
and
impulse
is
not
the
only
rule
of
life
and
that
something
is
gained
by
resisting
them
it
imitates
our
acts
long
before
it
can
understand
our
words
as
if
it
felt
its
insignificance
and
dreaded
to
be
arrested
in
some
lower
phase
of
its
development
its
instinct
for
obedience
becomes
almost
a
passion
as
the
vine
must
twine
or
grovel
so
the
child
comes
unconsciously
to
worship
idols
and
imitates
bad
patterns
and
examples
in
the
absence
of
worthy
ones
he
obeys
as
with
a
deep
sense
of
being
our
chattel
and
at
bottom
admires
those
who
coerce
him
if
the
means
be
wisely
chosen
the
authority
must
of
course
be
ascendancy
over
heart
and
mind
the
more
absolute
such
authority
the
more
the
will
is
saved
from
caprice
and
feels
the
power
of
steadiness
such
authority
excites
the
unique
unfathomable
sense
of
reverence
which
measures
the
capacity
for
and
is
the
strongest
and
soundest
of
all
moral
motives
it
is
also
the
most
comprehensive
for
it
is
first
felt
only
towards
persons
and
personality
is
a
bond
enabling
any
number
of
complex
elements
to
act
or
be
treated
as
whole
as
everything
does
and
is
in
the
child
soul
instead
of
in
isolation
and
detail
in
the
feeling
of
respect
culminating
in
worship
almost
all
educational
motives
are
involved
but
especially
those
which
alone
can
bring
the
will
to
maturity
and
happy
the
child
who
is
bound
by
the
mysterious
and
constraining
sympathy
of
dependence
by
which
if
unblighted
by
cynicism
a
worthy
mentor
directs
and
lifts
the
will
this
unconscious
reflection
of
our
character
and
wishes
is
the
diviner
side
of
childhood
by
which
it
is
quick
and
responsive
to
everything
in
its
moral
environment
the
child
may
not
be
able
to
tell
whether
its
teacher
often
smiles
dresses
in
this
way
or
that
speaks
loud
or
low
has
many
rules
or
not
though
every
element
of
her
personality
affects
him
profoundly
his
acts
of
will
have
not
been
but
a
mass
of
psychic
causes
far
greater
than
consciousness
can
estimate
have
laid
a
basis
of
character
than
which
heredity
alone
is
deeper
before
the
child
knows
he
has
a
will
these
influences
are
not
transient
but
for
if
the
conscious
and
intentional
may
anywhere
be
said
to
be
only
a
superficial
wave
over
the
depths
of
the
unconscious
it
is
in
the
sphere
of
but
command
and
obedience
must
also
be
specific
to
supplant
nature
here
begins
the
difficulty
a
young
child
can
know
no
general
commands
sit
in
your
chair
means
sit
a
moment
a
sort
of
trick
with
no
prohibition
to
stand
the
next
instant
any
act
may
be
done
in
the
next
room
all
is
here
and
now
and
patient
reiteration
till
habit
is
formed
and
no
rules
which
it
can
not
understand
or
remember
is
our
cue
obedience
can
however
be
instinct
even
here
and
is
its
chief
virtue
and
there
is
no
more
fear
of
weakening
the
will
by
it
than
in
the
case
of
soldiers
as
the
child
grows
older
however
and
as
the
acts
commanded
are
repugnant
or
unusual
there
should
be
increasing
care
lest
authority
be
compromised
sympathy
ruptured
or
lest
mutual
timidity
and
indecision
if
not
mutual
insincerity
and
dissimulation
as
well
as
parodied
disobedience
to
test
us
result
we
should
of
course
watch
for
favorable
moods
assume
no
unwonted
or
preternatural
dignity
or
owlish
air
of
wisdom
and
command
in
a
low
voice
which
does
not
too
rudely
break
in
upon
the
child
train
of
impressions
the
acts
we
command
or
forbid
should
be
very
few
at
first
but
inexorable
we
should
be
careful
not
to
forbid
where
we
can
not
follow
a
untrusty
child
or
what
we
can
not
prevent
our
own
will
should
be
a
rock
and
not
a
wave
our
requirements
should
be
uniform
with
no
whim
mood
or
periodicity
of
any
sort
about
them
if
we
alternate
from
caresses
to
severity
are
fields
and
capricious
instead
of
commanding
by
a
fixed
and
settled
plan
if
we
only
now
and
then
take
the
child
in
hand
so
he
does
not
know
precisely
what
to
expect
we
really
require
the
child
to
change
its
nature
with
every
change
in
us
and
well
for
the
child
who
can
defy
such
a
changeable
authority
which
not
only
unsettles
but
breaks
up
character
anew
when
it
is
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
formative
period
neglect
is
better
than
this
and
fear
of
inconsistency
of
authority
makes
the
best
parents
often
jealous
of
arbitrariness
in
teachers
only
thus
can
we
develop
general
habits
of
will
and
bring
the
child
to
know
general
maxims
of
conduct
inductively
and
only
thus
by
judicious
boldness
and
hardihood
in
command
can
we
bring
the
child
to
feel
the
conscious
strength
that
comes
only
from
doing
unpleasant
things
even
if
instant
obedience
be
only
external
at
first
it
will
work
inward
for
moods
are
controlled
by
work
and
it
is
only
will
which
enlarges
the
bounds
of
personality
yet
we
must
not
forget
that
even
morality
is
relative
and
is
one
thing
for
adults
and
often
quite
another
for
children
the
child
knows
nothing
of
absolute
truth
justice
or
virtues
the
various
stimuli
of
discipline
are
to
enforce
the
higher
though
weaker
insights
which
the
child
has
already
unfolded
rather
than
to
engraft
entirely
unintuited
good
the
command
must
find
some
ally
feeble
though
it
be
in
the
child
own
soul
we
should
strive
to
fill
each
moment
with
as
little
sacrifice
or
subordination
as
mere
means
or
conditions
to
the
future
as
possible
for
fear
of
affectation
and
insincerity
but
yet
the
hardier
and
sounder
the
nature
the
more
we
may
address
training
to
barely
nascent
intuitions
with
a
less
ingredient
of
immediate
satisfaction
and
the
deeper
the
higher
element
of
interest
will
be
grounded
in
the
end
the
child
must
find
as
he
advances
towards
maturity
that
every
new
insight
or
realization
of
his
own
reveals
the
fact
that
you
have
been
there
before
with
commands
cultivating
sentiments
and
habits
and
not
that
he
was
led
to
mistake
your
convenience
or
hobby
for
duty
or
failed
to
temper
the
will
by
temporizing
with
it
the
young
are
apt
to
be
most
sincere
at
an
age
when
they
are
also
most
mistaken
but
if
sincerity
be
kept
at
its
deepest
and
best
will
be
least
harmful
and
easiest
overcome
if
authority
supplement
rather
than
supersede
good
motives
the
child
will
so
love
authority
as
to
overcome
your
reluctance
to
apply
it
directly
and
as
a
final
result
will
choose
the
state
and
act
you
have
in
its
margin
of
freedom
and
will
be
all
the
less
liable
to
undue
subservience
to
priest
or
boss
or
fashion
or
tradition
later
as
obedience
gives
place
to
normal
manly
independence
in
these
and
many
other
ways
everything
in
conduct
should
be
mechanized
as
early
and
completely
as
possible
the
child
notion
of
what
is
right
is
what
is
habitual
and
the
simple
to
which
all
else
is
reduced
in
thought
is
identified
with
the
familiar
it
is
this
primitive
stratum
of
habits
which
principally
determines
our
deepest
belief
which
all
must
have
over
and
above
knowledge
to
which
men
revert
in
mature
years
from
youthful
vagaries
if
good
acts
are
a
diet
and
not
a
medicine
are
repeated
over
and
over
again
as
every
new
beat
of
the
loom
pounds
in
one
new
thread
and
sense
of
justice
and
right
is
wrought
into
the
very
and
fibers
if
this
ground
texture
of
the
soul
this
memory
and
this
sphere
of
thoughts
we
oftenest
think
and
acts
we
oftenest
do
is
early
rightly
and
indiscerptibly
wrought
not
only
does
it
become
a
web
of
destiny
for
us
so
is
it
but
we
have
something
perdurable
to
fall
back
on
if
moral
shock
or
crisis
or
change
or
calamity
shall
have
rudely
broken
up
the
whole
structure
of
later
associations
not
only
the
more
we
mechanize
thus
the
more
force
of
soul
is
freed
for
higher
work
but
we
are
insured
against
emergencies
in
which
the
choice
and
deed
is
likely
to
follow
the
nearest
motive
or
that
which
acts
quickest
rather
than
to
pause
and
be
influenced
by
higher
and
perhaps
intrinsically
stronger
motives
reflection
always
brings
in
a
new
set
of
motives
and
considerations
and
if
these
are
better
than
then
pause
is
good
if
not
he
who
deliberates
is
lost
our
purposive
volitions
are
very
few
compared
with
the
long
series
of
desires
acts
and
reactions
often
contradictory
many
of
which
were
never
conscious
and
many
once
willed
but
now
lapsed
to
reflexes
the
traces
of
which
crowding
the
unknown
margins
of
the
soul
constitute
the
organ
of
the
conscious
will
it
is
only
so
far
as
this
primitive
will
is
wrong
by
nature
or
training
that
drastic
reconstructions
of
any
sort
are
needed
only
those
who
mistake
weakness
for
innocence
or
simplicity
for
candor
or
forget
that
childish
faults
are
no
less
serious
because
universal
deny
the
at
least
occasional
depravity
of
all
children
or
fail
to
see
that
fear
and
pain
are
among
the
indispensables
of
education
while
a
parent
teacher
or
even
a
god
love
weakens
and
relaxes
the
will
children
do
not
cry
for
the
alphabet
the
multiplication
table
is
more
like
medicine
than
confectionery
and
it
is
only
affected
thoroughness
that
omits
all
that
is
hard
the
fruits
of
learning
may
be
sweet
but
its
roots
are
always
bitter
and
it
is
this
alone
that
makes
it
possible
to
strengthen
the
will
while
instructing
the
mind
the
will
comes
like
herder
to
scorn
the
luxury
of
knowing
without
the
labor
of
learning
we
must
anticipate
the
future
penalties
of
sloth
as
well
as
of
badness
the
will
especially
is
a
trust
we
are
to
administer
for
the
child
not
as
he
may
now
wish
but
as
he
will
wish
when
more
mature
we
must
now
compel
what
he
will
later
wish
to
compel
himself
to
do
to
find
his
habits
already
formed
to
the
same
law
that
his
mature
will
and
the
world
later
enjoin
cements
the
strongest
of
all
bonds
between
mentor
and
child
nothing
however
must
be
so
individual
as
punishment
for
some
a
threat
at
rare
intervals
is
enough
while
for
others
however
ominous
threats
may
be
they
become
at
once
like
scarecrows
on
which
the
foulest
birds
soonest
learn
to
perch
to
scold
well
and
wisely
is
an
art
by
itself
for
some
children
pardon
is
the
worst
punishment
for
others
ignoring
or
neglect
for
others
isolation
from
friends
suspension
from
duties
for
others
seclusion
which
last
however
is
for
certain
ages
beset
with
extreme
danger
and
for
still
others
shame
from
being
made
conspicuous
spencer
natural
penalties
can
be
applied
to
but
few
kinds
of
wrong
and
those
not
the
worst
basedow
tied
boys
who
fell
into
temptation
to
a
strong
pillar
to
brace
them
up
if
stupid
and
careless
put
on
a
fool
cap
and
bells
if
they
were
proud
they
were
suspended
near
the
ceiling
in
a
basket
as
aristophanes
represented
socrates
two
boys
who
quarreled
were
made
to
look
into
each
other
eyes
before
the
whole
school
till
their
angry
expressions
gave
way
before
the
general
sense
of
the
ridiculous
this
is
more
ingenious
than
wise
the
object
of
discipline
is
to
avoid
punishment
but
even
flogging
should
never
be
forbidden
it
maybe
reserved
like
a
sword
in
its
scabbard
but
should
not
get
so
rusted
in
that
it
can
not
be
drawn
on
occasion
the
law
might
even
limit
the
size
and
length
of
the
rod
and
place
of
application
as
in
germany
but
it
should
be
of
no
less
liberal
dimensions
here
than
there
punishment
should
of
course
be
minatory
and
reformatory
and
not
vindictive
and
we
should
not
forget
that
certainty
is
more
effective
than
severity
nor
that
it
is
apt
to
make
motives
sensuous
and
delay
the
psychic
restraint
which
should
early
preponderate
over
the
physical
but
for
boys
is
rarely
as
thorough
as
it
should
be
without
more
or
less
flogging
i
would
not
of
course
urge
the
extremes
of
the
past
the
spartan
beating
as
a
gymnastic
drill
to
toughen
the
severity
which
prevailed
in
germany
for
a
long
time
after
its
thirty
years
wars
the
former
fashion
in
many
english
schools
of
walking
up
not
infrequently
to
take
a
flogging
as
a
plucky
thing
to
do
and
with
no
notion
of
disgrace
attaching
to
it
shows
at
least
an
admirable
strength
of
will
severe
constraint
gives
poise
inwardness
inhibition
and
if
not
willingness
while
the
now
too
common
habit
of
coquetting
for
the
child
favor
and
tickling
its
ego
with
praises
and
prizes
and
pedagogic
pettifogging
for
its
and
sentimental
fear
of
a
judicious
slap
to
rouse
a
spoiled
child
with
no
will
to
break
to
make
it
keep
step
with
the
rest
in
conduct
instead
of
delaying
a
whole
to
apply
a
subtle
psychology
of
motives
on
it
is
bad
this
reminds
one
of
the
jain
who
sweeps
the
ground
before
him
lest
he
unconsciously
tread
on
a
worm
possibly
it
may
be
well
as
schleiermacher
suggests
not
to
repress
some
one
nascent
bad
act
in
some
natures
but
let
it
and
the
punishment
ensue
for
the
sake
of
spankster
tonic
dermal
pain
is
not
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
and
by
a
judicious
knowledge
of
how
it
feels
at
both
ends
of
the
rod
by
flogging
and
being
flogged
far
deeper
pains
may
be
forefended
insulting
defiance
deliberative
disobedience
ostentatious
carelessness
and
bravado
are
diseases
of
the
will
and
in
very
rare
cases
of
promethean
obstinacy
the
severe
process
of
breaking
the
will
is
needful
just
as
in
surgery
it
is
occasionally
needful
to
rebreak
a
limb
wrongly
set
or
deformed
to
set
it
over
better
it
is
a
cruel
process
but
a
crampy
will
in
childhood
means
moral
traumatism
of
some
sort
in
the
adult
few
parents
have
the
nerve
to
do
this
or
the
insight
to
see
just
when
it
is
needed
it
is
as
some
one
has
said
like
knocking
a
man
down
to
save
him
from
stepping
off
a
precipice
even
the
worst
punishments
are
but
very
faint
types
of
what
nature
has
in
store
in
later
life
for
some
forms
of
perversity
of
will
and
are
better
than
sarcasm
ridicule
or
tasks
as
penalties
the
strength
of
obstinacy
is
admirable
and
every
one
ought
to
have
his
own
will
but
a
false
direction
though
almost
always
the
result
of
faulty
previous
training
when
the
soul
more
fluid
and
mobile
is
all
the
more
fatal
while
so
few
intelligent
parents
are
able
to
refrain
from
the
of
too
much
rewarding
or
giving
even
though
it
injures
the
child
it
is
perhaps
too
much
to
expect
the
hardihood
which
can
be
justly
cold
to
the
caresses
of
a
child
who
seeks
by
displaying
all
its
stock
of
goodness
and
arts
of
endearment
to
buy
back
after
punishment
has
been
deserved
if
we
wait
too
long
and
punish
in
cold
blood
a
young
child
may
hate
us
while
if
we
punish
on
the
instant
and
with
passion
a
little
of
which
is
always
salutary
on
the
principle
affekt
kein
without
passion
no
effect
an
older
child
may
fail
of
the
natural
reactions
of
conscience
which
should
always
be
secured
the
maxim
jus
summa
the
rigor
of
the
law
may
be
the
greatest
wrong
we
are
often
told
is
peculiarly
true
in
school
and
so
it
is
but
to
forego
all
punishment
is
no
less
injustice
to
the
average
child
for
it
is
to
abandon
one
of
the
most
effective
means
of
we
never
punish
but
a
part
as
it
were
of
the
child
nature
he
has
lied
but
is
not
therefore
a
liar
and
we
deal
only
with
the
specific
act
and
must
love
all
the
rest
of
him
and
yet
after
all
indiscriminate
flogging
is
so
bad
and
the
average
teacher
is
so
inadequate
to
that
hardest
and
most
tactful
of
all
his
varied
duties
selecting
the
right
outcrop
of
the
right
fault
of
the
right
child
at
the
right
time
and
place
mood
for
best
effect
that
the
bold
statement
of
such
principles
as
above
is
perhaps
not
entirely
without
practical
danger
especially
in
two
cases
which
madame
necker
and
sigismund
have
pointed
out
and
in
several
cases
of
which
the
present
writer
has
notes
first
an
habitually
good
child
sometimes
has
a
saturnalia
of
defiance
and
disobedience
a
series
of
insubordinate
acts
are
suddenly
committed
which
really
mark
the
first
sudden
epochful
and
belated
birth
of
the
instinct
of
independence
and
on
which
his
future
manliness
will
depend
he
is
quite
irresponsible
the
acts
are
never
repeated
and
very
lenient
treatment
causes
him
after
the
conflict
of
tumultuous
feelings
has
expanded
his
soul
to
react
healthfully
into
habitual
docility
again
if
some
small
field
for
independent
action
be
at
once
opened
him
the
other
case
is
that
of
of
which
children
suffer
such
nameless
qualms
when
i
should
open
half
a
dozen
books
start
for
a
walk
and
then
turn
back
wander
about
in
mind
or
body
seeking
but
not
finding
content
in
anything
a
child
in
my
mood
will
wish
for
a
toy
an
amusement
food
a
rare
indulgence
only
to
neglect
or
even
reject
it
petulantly
when
granted
these
flitting
are
physical
are
a
mild
form
of
the
many
fatal
dangers
of
fatigue
and
punishment
is
the
worst
of
treatment
rest
or
diversion
is
the
only
cure
and
the
teacher
mind
must
be
fruitful
of
purposes
to
that
end
perhaps
a
third
case
for
palliative
treatment
is
those
lies
which
attend
the
first
sense
of
badness
the
desire
to
conceal
it
occasionally
accompanies
the
nascent
effort
to
reform
and
make
the
lie
true
these
cases
are
probably
rare
while
the
temptation
to
lie
is
far
greater
for
one
who
does
ill
than
for
one
who
does
well
for
fear
is
the
chief
motive
and
a
successful
lie
which
concealed
would
weaken
the
desire
to
cure
a
fault
we
have
thus
far
spoken
of
obedience
and
come
now
to
the
later
necessity
of
which
if
obedience
has
wrought
its
perfect
work
will
be
natural
and
inevitable
it
is
very
hard
to
combine
reason
and
coercion
yet
it
is
needful
that
children
think
themselves
free
long
before
we
cease
to
determine
them
as
we
slowly
cease
to
prescribe
and
begin
to
inspire
a
very
few
mottoes
proverbs
maxims
should
be
taught
very
simply
so
that
they
will
sink
deep
education
has
been
defined
as
working
against
the
chance
influences
of
life
and
it
is
certain
that
without
some
precepts
and
rules
the
will
will
not
exert
itself
if
reasons
are
given
and
energy
is
much
absorbed
in
understanding
the
child
will
assent
but
will
not
do
if
the
mind
is
not
strong
many
wide
ideas
are
very
dangerous
strong
wills
are
not
fond
of
arguments
and
if
a
young
person
falls
to
talking
or
thinking
beyond
his
experience
subjective
or
objective
both
conduct
and
thought
are
soon
confused
by
chaotic
and
incongruous
opinions
and
beliefs
and
false
expectations
which
are
the
very
seducers
of
the
will
arise
there
can
be
little
by
words
and
the
understanding
can
not
realize
the
ideals
of
the
will
all
great
things
are
dangerous
as
plato
said
and
the
truth
itself
is
not
only
false
but
actually
immoral
to
unexpanded
minds
is
intensive
not
extensive
and
the
writer
knows
a
case
in
which
even
a
vacation
ramble
with
a
moralizing
fabulist
has
undermined
the
work
of
years
our
precepts
must
be
made
very
familiar
copiously
illustrated
well
wrought
together
by
habit
and
attentive
thought
and
above
all
clear
cut
that
the
pain
of
violating
them
may
be
sharp
and
poignant
vague
and
too
general
precepts
beyond
the
horizon
of
the
child
real
experience
do
not
haunt
him
if
they
are
outraged
now
the
child
must
obey
these
and
will
if
he
has
learned
to
obey
well
the
command
of
others
one
of
the
best
sureties
that
he
will
do
so
is
for
if
the
latter
are
weaker
than
the
nerves
and
brain
the
gap
between
knowing
and
doing
appears
and
the
will
stagnates
gutsmuths
the
father
of
gymnastics
in
germany
before
jahn
used
to
warn
men
not
to
fancy
that
the
few
tiny
muscles
that
moved
the
pen
or
tongue
had
power
to
elevate
men
they
might
titillate
the
soul
with
words
and
ideas
but
rigorous
symmetrical
alone
he
and
his
turner
societies
believed
could
regenerate
the
fatherland
for
it
was
one
thing
to
paint
the
conflict
of
life
and
quite
another
to
bear
arms
in
it
they
said
the
weaker
the
body
the
more
it
commands
the
stronger
it
is
the
more
it
obeys
in
this
way
we
shall
have
a
strong
made
up
of
volitions
and
ideas
like
warp
and
woof
mind
and
will
will
be
so
compactly
organized
that
all
their
forces
can
be
brought
to
a
single
point
each
concept
or
purpose
will
call
up
those
related
to
it
and
once
strongly
set
toward
its
object
the
soul
will
find
itself
borne
along
by
unexpected
forces
this
power
of
totalizing
rather
than
any
transcendent
relation
of
elements
constitutes
at
least
the
practical
unity
of
the
soul
and
this
unimpeded
association
of
its
elements
is
true
or
inner
freedom
of
will
nothing
is
wanting
or
lost
when
the
powers
of
the
soul
are
mobilized
for
a
great
task
and
its
substance
is
impervious
to
passion
with
this
organization
men
of
really
little
power
accomplish
wonders
without
it
great
minds
are
confused
and
lost
they
have
only
velleity
or
caprice
the
will
makes
a
series
of
vigorous
perhaps
almost
convulsive
but
short
inconsistent
efforts
as
jean
paul
says
there
is
sulphur
charcoal
and
saltpetre
in
the
soul
but
powder
is
not
made
for
they
never
find
each
other
to
understand
this
is
preeminent
among
the
new
demands
now
laid
on
educators
but
although
this
focalizing
power
of
acting
with
the
whole
rather
than
with
a
part
of
the
soul
gives
independence
of
many
external
conventional
proximate
standards
of
conduct
deepening
our
interests
in
life
and
securing
us
against
disappointment
by
defining
our
expectations
while
such
a
sound
and
simple
is
proof
against
considerable
shock
and
has
firmness
of
texture
enough
to
bear
much
responsibility
there
is
of
course
something
deeper
without
which
all
our
good
conduct
is
more
or
less
hollow
this
is
that
better
purity
established
by
mothers
in
the
plastic
heart
before
the
superfoetation
of
precept
is
possible
or
even
before
the
soul
takes
flight
in
language
it
is
perhaps
or
hereditary
much
every
way
depends
on
how
aboriginal
our
goodness
is
whether
the
will
acts
with
effort
as
we
solve
an
intricate
problem
in
solitude
or
as
we
say
the
multiplication
table
which
only
much
distraction
can
confuse
or
as
we
repeat
the
alphabet
which
the
din
of
battle
could
not
hinder
later
and
earlier
training
should
harmonize
with
each
other
and
with
nature
thrice
happy
he
who
is
so
wisely
trained
that
he
comes
to
believe
he
believes
what
his
soul
deeply
does
believe
to
say
what
he
feels
and
feel
what
he
really
does
feel
and
chiefly
whose
express
volitions
square
with
the
profounder
drift
of
his
will
as
the
resultant
of
all
he
has
desired
or
wished
expected
attended
to
or
striven
for
when
such
an
one
comes
to
his
moral
majority
by
standing
for
the
first
time
upon
his
own
careful
conviction
against
the
popular
cry
or
against
his
own
material
interests
or
predaceous
passions
and
feels
the
constraint
and
joy
of
pure
obligation
which
comes
up
from
this
deep
source
a

original
force

this
free
habitual

the
highest

conviction
with
no

impractical
if
not
dangerous
ideal
for
it
can
be
actually
realized
only
by
the
rarest
moral
genius
for
most
of
us
the
best
education
is
that
which
makes
us
the
best
and
most
obedient
servants
this
is
the
way
of
peace
and
the
way
of
nature
for
even
if
we
seriously
try
to
keep
up
a
private
conscience
at
all
apart
from
feeling
faction
party
or

spirit
or
even

which
are

habitual
guides
the
difficulties
are
so
great

most
hasten
more
or
less
consciously
and
voluntarily
to
put
themselves
under
authority
again
serving
only
the
smallest
margin
of
independence
in
material
interests
choice
of
masters
etc
and
yielding
to
the
pleasing
and
easy
illusion
that
inflates
the
minimum
to
seem
the
maximum
of
freedom
and
uses
the
noblest
ideal
of
history
that
of
pure
autonomous
oughtness
as
a
pedestal
for
idols
of
selfishness
caprice
and
conceit
the
trouble
is
in
interpreting
these
moral
instincts
for
even
the
authorities
lack
the
requisite
in
which
all
wisdom
culminates
the
moral
interregnum
which
the
enlightenment
has
brought
will
not
end
till
these
instincts
are
rightly
interpreted
by
in
intelligence
the
richest
streams
of
thought
must
flow
about
them
the
best
methods
must
peep
and
pry
till
their
secrets
are

and
put
into

most
men

practical

moral
education

the

not

not

the

not

which
are
so
simple
without

by
which
they

it

because

as

and
the

during
the
critical
transition
period
while
we
oscillate
between
control
by
old
habits
or
association
within
the
old
circle
of
thought
and
by
the
new

as
a
medical

often
suffers
from
trying
to
bring
the

new

thus
most
especially
if
old
questions
concerning
which
we
have
long

ceased
to
trust
ourselves
to

need
to
be

there
is

danger
that
the

about

the

is
to
be
into
static
power
will
be
established
if
at
all
with
loss
instead
of
with

indeed
it
is
a
question
not
of
schools
but
of
civilization
whether
mental
training
from
the
three
r
to
science
and
philosophy
shall
really
make
men
better
as
the
theory
of
popular
education
assumes
and
whether
the
genius
and
talent
of
the
few
who
can
receive
and
bear
it
can
be
brought
to
the
full
maturity
of
a
knowledge
fully
facultized
a
question
paramount
even
in
a
republic
to
the
general
education
of
the
many
the
illusion
is
that
beginnings
are
hard
they
are
easy
almost
any
mind
can
advance
a
little
way
into
almost
any
subject
the
feeblest
youth
can
push
on
briskly
in
the
beginning
of
a
new
subject
but
he
forgets
and
so
does
the
examiner
who
marks
him
that
difficulties
increase
not
in
arithmetical
but
in
almost
geometrical
ratio
as
he
advances
the
fact
too
that
all
topics
are
taught
by
all
teachers
and
that
we
have
no
specialized
teaching
in
elementary
branches
and
that
examinations
are
placed
in
the
most
debilitating
part
of
our
peculiarly
debilitating
spring
these
help
us
to
solve
the
problem
which
china
has
solved
so
well
how
to
instruct

not
to
educate

in
it

for
that
of
or
more

one
choose
the
easier
method
of
tattooing
his
mind
by
attaining
the
easy
early
stages

several
of
the
more
important
discoveries
of
the
present
generation
which
cost
many
weary
months
of
toil
have
been

in
a

or
two
of
lines
so
that
every
experimenter
could
set
up
his
apparatus
and
get
the
results
in
a
few
minutes
let
us
not
forget
that
in
most
departments
of
mental
work
the
more
we
revise
and
reconstruct
our
thought
the
longer
we
inhibit
its
final
expression
while
the
oftener
we
return
to
it
refreshed
from
other
interests
the
clearer
and
more
permeable
for
other
minds
it
becomes
because
the
more
it
tends
to
express
itself
in
terms
of
willed
action
which
is
the
language
of
complete
men
so
closely
bound
together
are
moral
and
religious
training
that
a
discussion
of
one
without
the
other
would
be
incomplete
in
a
word
religion
is
the
most
generic
kind
of
culture
as
opposed
to
all
systems
or
departments
which
are
one
sided
all
education
culminates
in
it
because
it
is
chief
among
human
interests
and
because
it
gives
inner
unity
to
the
mind
heart
and
will
how
now
should
this
common
element
of
union
be
taught
to
be
really
effective
and
lasting
moral
and
religious
training
must
begin
in
the
cradle
it
was
a
profound
remark
of
froebel
that
unconsciousness
of
a
child
is
rest
in
this
need
not
be
understood
in
guy
pantheistic
sense
from
this
rest
in
god
the
childish
soul
should
not
be
abruptly
or
prematurely
aroused
even
the
primeval
stages
of
psychic
growth
are
rarely
so
so
purely
unsolicited
spontaneous
and
unprecocious
as
not
to
be
in
a
sense
a
fall
from
froebel
unconsciousness
or
rest
in
god
the
sense
of
touch
the
mother
of
all
the
other
senses
is
the
only
one
which
the
child
brings
into
the
world
already
experienced
but
by
the
pats
caresses
hugs
so
instinctive
with
young
mothers
varied
feelings
and
sentiments
are
communicated
to
the
child
long
before
it
recognizes
its
own
body
as
distinct
from
things
about
it
the
face
and
voice
are
the
first
conscious
objects
as
the
infant
soul
unfolds
and
she
soon
comes
to
stand
in
the
very
place
of
god
to
her
child
all
the
religion
of
which
the
child
is
capable
during
this
by
no
means
brief
stage
of
its
development
consists
of
those
sentiments
gratitude
trust
dependence
love
now
felt
only
for
her
which
are
later
directed
toward
god
the
less
these
are
now
cultivated
toward
the
mother
who
is
now
their
only
fitting
if
not
their
only
possible
object
the
more
feebly
they
will
later
be
felt
toward
god
this
too
adds
greatly
to
the
sacredness
and
the
responsibilities
of
motherhood
froebel
perhaps
is
right
that
thus
fundamental
religious
sentiments
can
be
cultivated
in
the
earliest
months
of
infancy
it
is
of
course
impossible
not
to
seem
perhaps
even
not
to
be
sentimental
upon
this
theme
for
the
infant
soul
has
no
other
content
than
sentiments
and
because
upon
these
rests
the
whole
superstructure
of
religion
in
child
or
adult
the
emotions
and
physical
and
mental
states
indeed
imparted
and
reproduced
in
the
infant
so
immediately
unconsciously
and
through
so
many
avenues
that
it
is
no
wonder
that
these
relations
see
mystic
whether
the
mother
is
habitually
under
the
influence
of
calm
and
tranquil
emotions
or
her
temper
is
fluctuating
or
violent
or
her
movements
are
habitually
energetic
or
soft
and
caressing
or
she
be
regular
or
irregular
in
her
ministrations
to
the
infant
in
her
arms
all
these
characteristics
and
habits
are
registered
in
the
primeval
language
of
touch
upon
the
nervous
system
of
the
child
from
this
point
of
view
poise
and
calmness
the
absence
of
all
intense
annuli
and
of
sensations
or
transitions
which
are
abrupt
or
sudden
and
an
atmosphere
of
quieting
influences
like
everything
which
retards
by
broadening
is
in
the
general
line
of
religious
culture
the
soul
of
an
infant
is
well
compared
to
a
seed
planted
in
a
garden
it
is
not
pressed
or
moved
by
the
breezes
which
rustle
the
leaves
overhead
the
sunlight
does
not
fall
upon
it
and
even
dew
and
evening
coolness
scarcely
reach
it
but
yet
there
is
not
a
breath
of
air
or
a
ray
of
sunshine
nor
a
drop
of
moisture
to
which
it
is
responsive
and
which
does
not
stir
all
its
germinant
forces
the
child
is
a
plant
must
live
out
of
doors
in
proper
season
and
there
must
be
no
forcing
religion
then
at
this
important
stage
at
least
is
naturalism
pure
and
simple
and
religious
training
is
the
supreme
art
of
standing
out
of
nature
way
so
implicit
is
the
unity
of
soul
and
body
at
this
formative
age
that
care
of
the
body
is
the
most
effective
culture
next
to
be
considered
are
the
sentiments
which
unfold
under
the
influence
of
that
fresh
and
naive
curiosity
which
attends
the
first
impressions
of
natural
objects
from
which
both
religion
and
science
spring
as
from
one
common
root
the
awe
and
sublimity
of
a
thunderstorm
the
sights
and
sounds
of
a
spring
morning
objects
which
lead
the
child
thoughts
to
what
is
remote
in
time
and
space
old
trees
ruins
the
rocks
and
above
all
the
heavenly
bodies
the
utilization
of
these
lessons
is
the
most
important
task
of
the
religious
teacher
during
the
stage
of
childhood
still
more
than
the
undevout
astronomer
the
undevout
child
under
such
influences
is
abnormal
in
these
directions
the
mind
of
the
child
is
as
open
and
plastic
as
that
of
the
ancient
prophet
to
the
promptings
of
the
inspiring
spirit
the
child
can
recognize
no
essential
difference
between
nature
and
the
supernatural
and
the
products
of
mythopoeic
fancy
which
have
been
spun
about
natural
objects
and
which
have
lain
so
long
and
so
warm
about
the
hearts
of
generations
and
races
of
men
are
now
the
best
of
all
nutriments
for
the
soul
to
teach
scientific
rudiments
only
about
nature
on
the
shallow
principle
that
nothing
should
be
taught
which
must
be
unlearned
or
to
encourage
the
child
to
assume
the
critical
attitude
of
mind
is
dwarfing
the
heart
and
prematurely
forcing
the
head
it
has
been
said
that
country
life
is
religion
for
children
at
this
stage
however
this
may
be
it
is
clear
that
natural
religion
is
rooted
in
such
experiences
and
precedes
revealed
religion
in
the
order
of
growth
and
education
whatever
its
logical
order
in
systems
of
thought
may
be
a
little
later
habits
of
truthfulness
are
best
cultivated
by
the
use
of
the
senses
in
exact
observation
to
see
a
simple
phenomenon
in
nature
and
report
it
fully
and
correctly
is
no
easy
matter
but
the
habit
of
trying
to
do
so
teaches
what
truthfulness
is
and
leaves
the
impress
of
truth
upon
the
whole
life
and
character
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
therefore
that
elements
of
science
should
be
taught
to
children
for
the
moral
effects
of
its
influences
at
the
same
time
all
truth
is
not
sensuous
and
this
training
alone
at
this
age
tends
to
make
the
mind
pragmatic
dry
and
insensitive
or
unresponsive
to
that
other
kind
of
truth
the
value
of
which
is
not
measured
by
its
certainty
so
much
as
by
its
effect
upon
us
we
must
learn
to
interpret
the
heart
and
our
native
instincts
as
truthfully
as
we
do
external
nature
for
our
happiness
in
life
depends
quite
as
largely
upon
bringing
our
beliefs
into
harmony
with
the
deeper
feelings
of
our
nature
as
it
does
upon
the
ability
to
adapt
ourselves
to
our
physical
environment
thus
not
only
all
religious
beliefs
and
moral
acts
will
strengthen
if
they
truly
express
the
character
instead
of
cultivating
affectation
and
insincerity
in
opinion
word
and
deed
as
with
mistaken
pedagogic
methods
they
may
do
this
latter
can
be
avoided
only
by
leaving
all
to
naturalism
and
spontaneity
at
first
and
feeding
the
soul
only
according
to
its
appetites
and
stage
of
growth
no
religious
truth
must
be
taught
as
fundamental
especially
as
fundamental
to
morality
which
can
be
seriously
doubted
or
even
misunderstood
yet
it
must
be
expected
that
convictions
will
be
transformed
and
worked
over
and
over
again
and
only
late
if
at
all
will
an
equilibrium
between
the
heart
and
the
truth
it
clings
to
as
finally
satisfying
be
attained
hence
most
positive
religious
instruction
or
public
piety
if
taught
at
all
should
be
taught
briefly
as
most
serious
but
too
high
for
the
child
yet
or
as
rewards
to
stimulate
curiosity
for
them
later
but
sacred
things
should
not
become
too
familiar
or
be
conventionalized
before
they
can
be
felt
or
understood
the
child
conception
of
god
should
not
be
personal
or
too
familiar
but
he
should
appear
distant
and
vague
inspiring
awe
and
reverence
far
more
than
love
in
a
word
as
the
god
of
nature
rather
than
as
devoted
to
serviceable
ministrations
to
the
child
individual
wants
the
latter
should
be
taught
to
be
a
faithful
servant
rather
than
a
favorite
of
god
the
inestimable
pedagogic
value
of
the
consists
in
that
it
widens
the
child
glimpse
of
the
whole
and
gives
the
first
presentment
of
the
universality
of
laws
such
as
are
observed
in
its
experiences
and
that
of
others
so
that
all
things
seem
comprehended
under
one
stable
system
or
government
the
slow
realization
that
god
laws
are
not
like
those
of
parents
and
teachers
evadible
suspensible
but
changeless
and
their
penalties
sure
as
the
laws
of
nature
is
most
important
factor
of
moral
training
first
the
law

is
the
order
of
growth
the
pains
or
pleasures
which
follow
many
acts
are
immediate
while
the
results
that
follow
others
are
so
remote
or
so
serious
that
the
child
must
utilize
the
experience
of
others
artificial
rewards
and
punishments
must
be
cunningly
devised
so
as
to
simulate
and
typify
as
closely
as
possible
the
real
natural
penalty
and
they
must
be
administered
uniformly
and
impartially
like
laws
of
nature
as
commands
are
just
and
as
they
are
gradually
perceived
to
spring
from
superior
wisdom
respect
arises
which
kant
called
the
bottom
motive
of
duty
and
defined
as
the
immediate
determination
of
the
will
by
law
thwarting
here
the
child
reverences
what
is
not
understood
as
authority
and
to
the
childish
why
which
always
implies
imperfect
respect
for
the
authority
however
displeasing
its
behest
the
teacher
or
parent
should
always
reply
you
can
not
understand
why
yet
unless
quite
sure
that
a
convincing
and
controlling
insight
can
be
given
such
as
shall
make
all
future
exercise
of
outward
authority
in
this
particular
unnecessary
from
this
standpoint
the
great
importance
of
the
character
and
native
dignity
of
the
teacher
is
best
seen
daily
contact
with
some
teachers
is
itself
ethical
education
for
the
child
without
a
spoken
precept
here
too
the
real
advantage
of
male
over
female
teachers
especially
for
boys
is
seen
in
their
superior
physical
strength
which
often
if
highly
estimated
gives
real
dignity
and
commands
real
respect
and
especially
in
the
unquestionably
greater
uniformity
of
their
moods
and
their
discipline
during
the
first
years
of
school
life
a
point
of
prime
importance
in
training
is
the
education
of
conscience
this
latter
is
the
most
complex
and
perhaps
the
most
educable
of
all
our
faculties
a
system
of
carefully
arranged
talks
with
copious
illustrations
from
history
and
literature
about
such
topics
as
fair
play
slang
cronies
dress
teasing
getting
mad
prompting
in
class
white
lies
affectation
cleanliness
order
honor
taste
treatment
of
animals
reading
vacation
pursuits
can
be
brought
quite
within
the
range
of
interests
by
a
sympathetic
and
tactful
teacher
and
be
made
immediately
and
obviously
practical
all
this
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
the
old
superstition
that
children
have
innate
faculties
of
such
a
finished
sort
that
they
flash
up
and
grasp
the
principle
of
things
by
a
rapid
sort
of
first
intellection
an
error
that
made
all
departments
of
education
so
trivial
assumptive
and
dogmatic
for
centuries
before
comenius
basedow
and
pestalozzi
has
been
banished
everywhere
save
from
moral
and
religious
training
where
it
still
persists
in
full
force
the
senses
develop
first
and
all
the
higher
intuitions
called
by
the
collective
name
of
conscience
gradually
and
later
in
life
they
first
take
the
form
of
sentiments
without
much
insight
and
are
hence
liable
to
be
unconscious
affectation
and
are
caught
insensibly
from
the
environment
with
the
aid
of
inherited
predisposition
and
only
made
more
definite
by
such
talks
as
the
above
but
parents
are
prone
to
forget
that
healthful
and
correct
sentiments
concerning
matters
of
conduct
are
at
first
very
feeble
and
that
the
sense
of
obligation
needs
the
long
and
careful
guardianship
of
external
authority
just
as
a
young
medical
student
with
a
rudimentary
notion
of
physiology
and
hygiene
is
sometimes
disposed
to
undertake
a
more
or
less
complete
reform
of
his
diet
regimen
to
make
it
scientific
in
a
way
that
an
older
and
a
more
learned
physician
would
shrink
from
so
the
of
boys
into
matters
of
moral
regimen
are
far
too
apt
in
the
american
temperament
to
expend
in
precocious
emancipation
and
crude
attempts
at
practical
realization
the
force
which
is
needed
to
bring
their
insights
to
maturity
authority
should
be
relaxed
gradually
explicitly
and
provisionally
over
one
definite
department
of
conduct
at
a
time
to
distinguish
right
and
wrong
in
their
own
nature
is
the
highest
and
most
complex
of
intellectual
processes
most
men
and
all
children
are
guided
only
by
associations
of
greater
or
less
subtlety
perhaps
the
whole
round
of
human
duties
might
be
best
taught
by
gathering
illustrations
of
selfishness
and
tracing
it
in
its
countless
disguises
and
ramifications
through
every
stage
of
life
selfishness
is
opposed
to
a
sense
of
the
infinite
and
is
inversely
as
real
religion
and
the
study
of
it
is
not
like
systematic
ethics
apt
to
be
confused
and
made
unpractical
by
conflicting
theories
the
bible
the
great
instrument
in
the
education
of
conscience
is
far
less
juvenile
than
it
is
now
the
fashion
to
suppose
at
the
very
least
it
expresses
the
result
of
the
ripest
human
experience
the
noblest
traditions
of
humanity
old
testament
history
even
more
than
most
very
ancient
history
is
distilled
to
an
almost
purely
ethical
content
for
centuries
scripture
was
withheld
from
the
masses
for
the
same
reason
that
plato
refused
at
first
to
put
his
thoughts
into
writing
because
it
would
be
sure
to
be
misunderstood
by
very
many
and
lead
to
that
worst
of
errors
and
fanaticism
caused
by
children
should
not
approach
it
too
lightly
the
old
testament
perhaps
before
or
more
than
the
new
is
the
bible
for
childhood
a
good
protracted
course
of
the
law
pedagogically
prepares
the
way
for
the
apprehension
of
the
gospel
then
the
study
of
the
old
testament
should
begin
with
selected
tales
told
as
in
the
german
schools
impressively
in
the
teacher
language
but
objectively
and
without
exegetical
or
hortatory
comment
the
appeal
is
directly
to
the
understanding
only
at
first
but
the
moral
lesson
is
brought
clearly
and
surely
within
the
child
reach
but
not
personally
applied
after
the
manner
common
with
us
probably
the
most
important
changes
for
the
educator
to
study
are
those
which
begin
between
the
ages
of
twelve
and
sixteen
and
are
completed
only
some
years
later
when
the
young
adolescent
receives
from
nature
a
new
capital
of
energy
and
altruistic
feeling
it
is
physiological
second
birth
and
success
in
life
depends
upon
the
care
and
wisdom
with
which
this
new
and
final
invoice
of
energy
is
husbanded
these
changes
constitute
a
natural
predisposition
to
a
change
of
heart
and
may
perhaps
be
called
in
kantian
phrase
its
even
from
the
psychophysic
standpoint
it
is
a
correct
instinct
which
has
slowly
led
churches
to
center
so
much
of
their
cultus
upon
regeneration
in
this
i
of
course
only
assert
here
the
neurophysical
side
which
is
everywhere
present
even
if
everywhere
subordinate
to
the
spiritual
side
as
everywhere
so
here
too
the
physical
may
be
called
in
a
sense
regulative
rather
than
constitutive
it
is
therefore
not
surprising
that
statistics
show
that
far
more
conversions
proportionately
take
place
during
the
adolescent
period
which
does
not
normally
end
before
the
age
of
or
five
than
during
any
other
period
of
equal
length
at
this
age
most
churches
confirm
before
this
age
the
child
lives
in
the
present
is
normally
selfish
deficient
in
sympathy
but
frank
and
confidential
obedient
to
authority
and
without
affectation
save
the
supreme
affectation
of
childhood
assuming
the
words
manners
habits
of
those
older
than
itself
but
now
stature
suddenly
increases
and
the
power
of
physical
and
mental
endurance
and
effort
diminishes
for
a
time
larynx
nose
chin
change
and
normal
and
morbid
ancestral
traits
and
features
appear
far
greater
and
more
protracted
though
unseen
are
the
changes
which
take
place
in
the
nervous
system
both
in
the
development
of
the
cortex
and
expansion
of
the
convolutions
and
the
growth
of
by
which
the
elements
shoot
together
and
relation
of
things
are
seen
which
hitherto
seemed
independent
to
which
it
seems
as
if
for
a
few
years
the
energies
of
growth
were
chiefly
directed
hence
this
period
is
so
critical
and
changes
in
character
are
so
rapid
no
matter
how
confidential
the
relations
with
the
parent
may
have
been
an
important
domain
of
the
soul
now
declares
its
independence
confidences
are
shared
with
those
of
equal
age
and
withheld
from
parents
especially
by
boys
to
an
extent
probably
little
suspected
by
most
parents
education
must
be
addressed
to
freedom
which
recognizes
only
law
and
spontaneity
of
opinion
and
conduct
is
manifested
often
in
extravagant
and
grotesque
forms
there
is
now
a
longing
for
that
kind
of
close
sympathy
and
friendship
which
makes
cronies
and
intimates
there
is
a
craving
for
strong
emotions
which
gives
pleasure
in
exaggerations
and
there
are
nameless
longings
for
what
is
far
remote
strange
which
emphasizes
the
which
hegel
so
well
describes
and
which
marks
the
normal
rise
of
the
presentiment
of
something
higher
than
self
instincts
of
rivalry
and
competition
now
grow
strong
in
boys
and
girls
grow
more
conscientious
and
inward
and
begin
to
feel
their
music
reading
religion
painting
and
to
realize
the
bearing
of
these
upon
their
future
adult
life
there
is
often
a
strong
instinct
of
devotion
and
toward
some
perhaps
almost
any
object
or
in
almost
any
cause
which
circumstances
may
present
moodiness
and
perhaps
a
love
of
solitude
are
developed
growing
fits
make
hard
and
severe
labor
of
body
and
mind
impossible
without
dwarfing
or
arresting
the
development
by
robbing
of
its
nutrition
some
part
of
the
organism
stomach
lungs
chest
heart
back
brain
which
is
peculiarly
liable
to
disease
later
it
is
never
so
hard
to
tell
the
truth
plainly
and
objectively
and
without
any
subjective
twist
the
life
of
the
mere
individual
ceases
and
that
of
person
or
better
of
the
race
begins
it
is
a
period
of
realization
and
hence
often
of
introspection
in
healthy
natures
it
is
the
golden
age
of
life
in
which
enthusiasm
sympathy
generosity
and
curiosity
are
at
their
strongest
and
best
and
when
growth
is
so
rapid
that
each
college
class
is
conscious
of
a
vast
interval
of
development
which
separates
it
from
the
class
below
but
it
is
also
a
period
subject
to
wertherian
crises
such
as
hume
richter
mill
and
others
passed
through
and
all
depends
on
the
direction
given
to
these
new
forces
the
dangers
of
this
period
are
great
and
manifest
the
chief
of
these
far
greater
even
than
the
dangers
of
intemperance
is
that
the
sexual
elements
of
soul
and
body
will
be
developed
prematurely
and
disproportionately
indeed
early
maturity
in
this
respect
is
itself
bad
if
it
occurs
before
other
compensating
and
controlling
powers
are
unfolded
this
element
is
hypertrophied
and
absorbs
and
dwarfs
their
energy
and
it
is
then
more
likely
to
be
uninstructed
and
to
suck
up
all
that
is
vile
in
the
environment
far
more
than
we
realize
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
youth
center
about
this
factor
of
his
nature
quite
apart
therefore
from
its
intrinsic
value
education
should
serve
the
purpose
of
preoccupation
and
should
divert
attention
from
an
element
of
our
nature
the
premature
or
excessive
development
of
which
dwarfs
every
part
of
soul
and
body
intellectual
interests
athleticism
social
and
esthetic
tastes
should
be
cultivated
there
should
be
some
change
in
external
life
previous
routine
and
must
be
broken
through
and
new
occupations
resorted
to
that
the
mind
may
not
be
left
idle
while
the
hands
are
mechanically
employed
attractive
friendships
well
chosen
and
on
a
high
plane
and
regular
habits
should
of
course
be
cultivated
now
too
though
the
intellect
is
not
frequently
judged
insane
so
that
pubescent
insanity
is
comparatively
rare
the
feelings
which
are
yet
more
fundamental
to
mental
sanity
are
most
often
perverted
and
lack
of
emotional
steadiness
violent
and
dangerous
impulses
unreasonable
conduct
lack
of
enthusiasm
and
sympathy
are
very
commonly
caused
by
abnormalities
here
neurotic
disturbances
such
as
hysteria
chorea
and
in
the
opinion
of
some
physicians
and
early
dementia
are
peculiarly
liable
to
appear
and
become
seated
during
this
period
in
short
the
previous
selfhood
is
broken
up
like
the
regulation
copy
handwriting
of
early
school
years
and
a
new
individual
is
in
process
of
crystallization
all
is
solvent
plastic
peculiarly
susceptible
to
external
influences
between
love
and
religion
god
and
nature
have
wrought
a
strong
and
indissoluble
bond
flagellations
fasts
exposure
excessive
penances
of
many
kinds
the
hindoo
cultus
of
quietude
and
mental
absorption
in
vacuity
and
even
one
pedagogic
motive
of
a
cultus
of
the
spiritual
and
supernatural
in
the
symposium
of
plato
are
all
designed
as
palliatives
and
alteratives
of
degraded
love
change
of
heart
before
pubescent
years
there
are
several
scientific
reasons
for
thinking
means
precocity
and
forcing
the
age
signalized
by
the
ancient
greeks
as
that
at
which
the
study
of
what
was
comprehensively
called
music
should
begin
the
age
at
which
roman
guardianship
ended
as
explained
by
sir
henry
maine
at
which
boys
are
confirmed
in
the
modern
greek
catholic
lutheran
and
episcopal
churches
and
at
which
the
child
jesus
entered
the
temple
is
as
early
as
any
child
ought
consciously
to
go
about
his
heavenly
father
business
if
children
are
instructed
in
the
language
of
these
sentiments
too
early
the
deepening
and
broadening
of
soul
and
of
conscience
which
should
come
with
adolescent
years
will
be
incomplete
revival
sermon
which
the
writer
has
heard
preached
to
very
young
children
are
analogous
to
exhorting
them
to
imagine
themselves
married
people
and
inculcating
the
duties
of
that
relation
it
is
because
this
precept
is
violated
in
the
intemperate
haste
for
immediate
results
that
we
may
so
often
hear
childish
sentiments
and
puerile
expressions
so
strangely
mingled
in
the
religious
experience
of
otherwise
apparently
mature
adults
which
remind
one
of
a
male
voice
constantly
modulating
from
manly
tones
into
boyish
falsetto
some
one
has
said
of
very
early
risers
that
they
were
apt
to
be
conceited
all
the
forenoon
and
stupid
and
uninteresting
all
the
afternoon
and
evening
so
too
precocious
infant
christians
are
apt
to
be
conceited
and
full
of
pious
affectations
all
the
forenoon
of
life
and
thereafter
commonplace
enough
in
their
religious
life
one
is
reminded
of
aristotle
theory
of
catharsis
according
to
which
the
soul
was
purged
of
strong
or
bad
passions
by
listening
to
vivid
representations
of
them
on
the
stage
so
by
the
forcing
method
we
deprecate
the
soul
is
given
just
enough
religious
stimulus
to
act
as
an
inoculation
against
deeper
and
more
serious
interest
later
at
this
age
the
prescription
of
a
series
of
strong
feelings
is
very
apt
to
cause
attention
to
concentrate
on
physical
states
in
a
way
which
may
culminate
in
the
increased
activity
of
the
passional
nature
or
may
induce
that
sort
of
which
is
expressed
in
morbid
love
of
autobiographic
confessional
outpourings
or
may
issue
in
the
supreme
selfishness
of
incipient
and
often
unsuspected
hysteria
those
who
are
led
to
christ
normally
by
obeying
conscience
are
not
apt
to
endanger
the
foundation
of
their
moral
character
if
they
should
later
chance
to
doubt
the
doctrine
of
verbal
inspiration
or
some
of
the
miracles
or
even
get
confused
about
the
trinity
because
their
religious
nature
is
not
built
on
the
sand
the
art
of
leading
young
men
through
college
without
ennobling
or
enlarging
any
of
the
religious
notions
of
childhood
is
and
unworthy
philosophy
and
is
to
leave
men
puerile
in
the
highest
department
of
their
nature
at
the
age
we
have
indicated
when
the
young
man
instinctively
takes
the
control
of
himself
into
his
own
hands
previous
training
should
be
brought
to
a
focus
and
given
a
personal
application
which
to
be
most
effective
should
probably
in
most
cases
be
according
to
the
creed
of
the
parent
it
is
a
serious
and
solemn
epoch
and
ought
to
be
fittingly
signalised
morality
now
needs
religion
which
can
not
have
affected
life
much
before
now
duties
should
be
recognised
as
divine
commands
for
the
strongest
motives
natural
and
supernatural
are
needed
for
the
regulation
of
the
new
impulses
passions
desires
half
insights
ambitions
which
come
to
the
american
temperament
so
suddenly
before
the
methods
of
can
become
established
and
operative
now
a
deep
personal
sense
of
purity
and
impurity
are
first
possible
and
indeed
inevitable
and
this
natural
moral
tension
is
a
great
opportunity
to
the
religious
teacher
a
serious
sense
of
god
within
and
of
responsibilities
which
transcend
this
life
as
they
do
the
power
of
comprehension
a
feeling
for
duties
deepened
by
a
realization
and
experience
of
their
conflict
such
as
some
have
thought
to
be
the
origin
of
religion
itself
in
the
soul
these
too
are
elements
of
the
theology
of
the
heart
revealed
at
this
age
to
every
serious
youth
but
to
the
judicious
emphasis
and
utilization
of
which
the
teacher
should
lend
his
consummate
skill
while
special
lines
of
interest
leading
to
a
career
must
be
now
well
grounded
there
must
also
be
a
culture
of
the
ideal
and
an
absorption
in
general
views
and
remote
and
universal
ends
if
all
that
is
pure
and
disciplining
in
what
is
transcendent
whether
to
the
christian
believers
the
poet
or
the
philosopher
had
even
been
devised
only
for
the
better
regulation
of
human
energies
set
free
at
this
age
but
not
yet
fully
defined
or
realized
they
would
still
have
a
most
potent
justification
on
this
ground
alone
at
any
rate
what
is
often
wasted
in
excess
here
if
husbanded
ripens
into
philosophy
the
larger
love
to
the
world
the
true
and
the
good
in
a
sense
not
unlike
that
in
the
symposium
of
plato
finally
there
is
danger
lest
this
change
as
prescribed
and
formulated
by
the
church
be
too
sudden
and
violent
and
the
capital
of
moral
force
which
should
last
a
lifetime
be
consumed
in
a
brief
convulsive
effort
like
the
sudden
running
down
of
a
watch
if
its
spring
be
broken
piety
is
naturally
the
slowest
because
the
most
comprehensive
kind
of
growth
quetelet
says
that
the
measure
of
the
state
of
civilization
in
a
nation
is
the
way
in
which
it
achieves
its
revolutions
as
it
becomes
truly
civilized
revolutions
cease
to
be
sudden
and
violent
and
become
gradually
transitory
and
without
abrupt
change
the
same
is
true
of
that
individual
crisis
which
describes
as
adolescence
and
of
which
theology
formulates
a
higher
spiritual
potency
as
conversion
the
adolescent
period
lasts
ten
years
or
more
during
all
of
which
development
of
every
sort
is
very
rapid
and
constant
and
it
is
as
already
remarked
intemperate
haste
for
immediate
results
of
reaping
without
sowing
which
has
made
so
many
regard
change
of
heart
as
an
instantaneous
conquest
rather
than
as
a
growth
and
persistently
to
forget
that
there
is
something
of
importance
before
and
after
it

the

i
wish
i
could
have
written
myself
and
i
can
think
of
no
single
educational
volume
in
the
range
of
literature
in
this
field
that
i
believe
so
well
calculated
to
do
so
much
good
at
the
present
time
and
which
i
could
so
heartily
advise
every
teacher
in
the
land
of
whatever
grade
to
read
and
stanley

clark
it
is
to
my
mind
the
most
stimulating
book
that
has
appeared
for
a
long
time
the
conception
here
set
forth
of
the
function
of
the
school
is
i
believe
the
broadest
and
best
that
has
been
formulated
the
chapter
on
illustrative
methods
is
worth
more
than
all
the
books
on
that
i
know
of
the
diagrams
and
tables
are
very
convincing
i
am
satisfied
that
the
author
has
given
us

book

recommended

dickens
as
an
educator
by

inspector
of

toronto
vol
cloth
adopted
by
several
state
teachers
reading
circles
all
teachers
have
read
dickens
novels
with
pleasure
probably
few
however
have
presumably
thought
definitely
of
him
as
a
great
educational
reformer
but
inspector
hughes
demonstrates
that
such
is
his
just
title
william
harris
says
of
dickens
as
an
educator
this
book
is
sufficient
to
establish
the
claim
for
dickens
as
an
educational
reformer
he
has
done
more
than
any
one
else
to
secure
for
the
child
considerate
treatment
of
his
tender
age
dickens
stands
apart
and
alone
as
one
of
the
most
potent
influences
of
social
reform
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
therefore
deserves
to
be
read
and
studied
by
all
who
have
to
do
with
schools
and
by
all
parents
everywhere
in
our
day
and
generation
professor
hughes
asserts
that
dickens
was
the
most
profound
exponent
of
the
kindergarten
and
the
most
comprehensive
student
of
childhood
that
england
has
yet
produced
the
book
brings
into
connected
form
under
proper
headings
the
educational
principles
of
this
most
sympathetic
friend
of
children
james
hughes
has
just
published
a
book
that
will
rank
as
one
of
the
finest
appreciations
of
dickens
ever
written
school
hughes
has
brought
together
in
an
interesting
and
most
effective
manner
the
chief
teachings
of
dickens
on
educational
subjects
his
extracts
make
the
reader
feel
again
the
reality
of
descriptions
and
the
power
of
the
appeal
that
he
made
for
a
saner
kindlier
more
inspiring
pedagogy
and
thus
became
through
his
immense
vogue
one
of
the
chief
instrumentalities
