travels
in
syria
and
the
holy
land
by
the
late
john
lewis
burckhardt
published
by
the
association
for
promoting
the
discovery
of
the
interior
parts
of
africa
preface
of
the
editor
it
is
hoped
that
little
apology
is
necessary
for
the
publication
of
a
volume
of
travels
in
asia
by
a
society
whose
sole
professed
object
is
the
promotion
of
discoveries
in
the
african
continent
the
association
having
had
the
good
fortune
to
obtain
the
services
of
a
person
of
burckhardt
education
and
talents
resolved
to
spare
neither
time
nor
expense
in
enabling
him
to
acquire
the
language
and
manners
of
an
arabian
musulman
in
such
a
degree
of
perfection
as
should
render
the
detection
of
his
real
character
in
the
interior
of
africa
extremely
difficult
it
was
thought
that
a
residence
at
aleppo
would
afford
him
the
most
convenient
means
of
study
while
his
intercourse
with
the
natives
of
that
city
together
with
his
occasional
tours
in
syria
would
supply
him
with
a
view
of
arabian
life
and
manners
in
every
degree
from
the
bedouin
camp
to
the
populous
city
while
thus
preparing
himself
for
the
ultimate
object
of
his
mission
he
was
careful
to
direct
his
journeys
through
those
parts
of
syria
which
had
been
the
least
frequented
by
european
travellers
and
thus
he
had
the
opportunity
of
making
some
important
additions
to
our
knowledge
of
one
of
those
countries
of
which
the
geography
is
not
less
interesting
by
its
connection
with
ancient
history
than
it
is
imperfect
in
consequence
of
the
impediments
which
modern
barbarism
has
opposed
to
scientific
researches
after
consuming
near
three
years
in
syria
burckhardt
on
his
arrival
in
egypt
found
himself
prevented
from
pursuing
the
execution
of
his
instructions
by
a
suspension
of
the
usual
commercial
intercourse
with
the
interior
of
africa
and
was
thus
during
the
ensuing
five
years
placed
under
the
necessity
of
employing
his
time
in
egypt
and
the
adjacent
countries
in
the
same
manner
as
he
had
done
in
syria
after
the
journeys
in
egypt
nubia
arabia
and
mount
sinai
which
have
been
briefly
described
in
the
memoir
prefixed
to
the
former
volume
of
his
travels
his
death
at
cairo
at
the
moment
when
he
was
preparing
for
immediate
departure
to
fezzan
left
the
association
in
possession
of
a
large
collection
of
manuscripts
concerning
the
countries
visited
by
their
traveller
in
these
preparatory
journeys
but
of
nothing
more
than
oral
information
as
to
those
to
which
he
had
been
particularly
sent
as
his
journals
in
nubia
and
in
the
regions
adjacent
to
the
astaboras
although
relating
only
to
an
incidental
part
of
his
mission
to
africa
were
descriptive
of
countries
coming
strictly
within
the
scope
of
the
african
association
these
together
with
all
his
collected
information
on
the
interior
of
africa
were
selected
for
earliest
publication
the
present
volume
contains
his
observations
in
syria
and
arabia
petraea
to
which
has
been
added
his
tour
in
the
peninsula
of
mount
sinai
although
the
latest
of
all
his
travels
in
date
because
it
is
immediately
connected
by
its
subject
with
his
journey
through
the
adjacent
districts
of
the
holy
land
there
still
remain
manuscripts
sufficient
to
fill
two
volumes
one
of
these
will
consist
of
his
travels
in
arabia
which
were
confined
to
the
hedjaz
or
holy
land
of
the
musulmans
the
part
least
accessible
to
christians
the
fourth
volume
will
contain
very
copious
remarks
on
the
arabs
on
the
desert
and
particularly
the
wahabys
the
two
principal
maps
annexed
to
the
present
volume
have
been
constructed
under
the
continued
inspection
of
the
editor
by
john
walker
junior
by
whom
they
have
been
delineated
and
engraved
in
the
course
of
this
process
it
has
been
found
that
our
traveller
bearings
by
the
compass
are
not
always
to
be
relied
on
those
which
were
obviously
incorrect
and
useless
for
geographical
purposes
have
been
omitted
in
the
journal
some
instances
of
the
same
kind
which
did
not
occur
to
the
editor
until
the
sheets
were
printed
are
noticed
in
the
errata
and
if
a
few
still
remain
the
reader
is
intreated
not
to
consider
them
as
proofs
of
negligence
in
the
formation
of
the
maps
which
have
been
carefully
constructed
from
materials
occasionally
assisted
and
corrected
by
other
extant
authorities
one
can
not
easily
decide
whether
the
errors
in
our
traveller
bearings
are
chiefly
to
be
attributed
to
the
variable
nature
of
the
instrument
or
to
the
circumstances
of
haste
and
concealment
under
which
he
was
often
obliged
to
take
his
observations
though
it
is
sufficiently
evident
that
be
fell
into
the
error
not
uncommon
with
unexperienced
travellers
of
multiplying
bearings
to
an
excessive
degree
instead
of
verifying
a
smaller
number
and
measuring
intermediate
angles
with
a
pocket
sextant
however
his
mistakes
may
have
arisen
the
consequence
has
been
that
some
parts
of
the
general
map
illustrative
of
his
journeys
in
syria
and
the
holy
land
have
been
constructed
less
from
his
bearings
than
from
his
distances
in
time
combined
with
those
of
other
travellers
and
checked
by
some
known
points
on
the
coast
hence
also
a
smaller
scale
has
been
chosen
for
that
map
than
may
be
formed
from
the
same
materials
when
a
few
points
in
the
interior
are
determined
by
celestial
observations
in
the
mean
time
it
is
hoped
that
the
present
sketch
will
be
sufficient
to
enable
the
reader
to
pursue
the
narrative
without
much
difficulty
especially
as
the
part
of
syria
which
the
traveller
examined
with
more
minuteness
than
any
other
the
haouran
is
illustrated
by
a
map
upon
a
larger
scale
which
has
been
composed
from
two
delineations
made
by
him
in
his
two
journeys
in
that
province
it
appears
unnecessary
to
the
editor
to
enter
into
any
lengthened
discussion
in
justification
of
the
ancient
names
which
he
has
inserted
in
the
maps
he
thinks
it
sufficient
to
refer
to
the
copious
exposition
of
the
evidences
of
sacred
geography
contained
in
the
celebrated
work
of
reland
much
is
still
wanting
to
complete
this
most
interesting
geographical
comparison
and
as
a
great
part
of
the
country
visited
by
burckhardt
has
since
his
time
been
explored
by
a
gentleman
better
qualified
to
illustrate
its
antiquities
by
his
learning
who
travelled
under
more
favourable
circumstances
and
who
was
particuarly
diligent
in
collecting
those
most
faithful
of
all
geographical
evidences
ancient
inscriptions
it
may
be
left
to
bankes
to
illustrate
more
fully
the
ancient
geography
of
the
decapolis
and
adjoining
districts
and
to
remove
some
of
the
difficulties
arising
from
the
ambiguity
of
the
ancient
authorities
it
will
be
found
perhaps
that
our
traveller
is
incorrect
in
supposing
that
the
ruins
at
omkeis
are
those
of
gamala
for
the
situalion
of
omkeis
the
strength
of
its
position
and
the
extent
of
the
ruins
all
favour
the
opinion
that
it
was
gadara
the
chief
city
of
peraea
the
strongest
place
in
this
part
of
the
country
and
the
situation
of
which
on
a
mountain
over
against
tiberias
and
scythopolis
bel
euseb
onomast
in
greek
text
the
distance
of
the
ruins
at
omkeis
from
the
hieromax
and
the
hot
baths
seems
to
have
been
burckhardt
objection
to
their
being
the
remains
of
gadara
but
this
distance
is
justified
by
jerom
by
eusebius
and
by
a
writer
of
the
century
according
to
the
two
former
authors
the
hot
baths
were
not
at
gadara
but
at
a
place
near
it
called
aitham
or
aimath
or
emmatha
and
the
latter
correctly
states
the
distance
at
five
miles
reland
palaest
perhaps
gamala
was
at
el
hosn
gaulanitis
of
which
gamala
was
the
chief
town
will
then
correspond
very
well
with
djolan
corresponds
precisely
with
that
of
omkeis
but
it
will
probably
be
admitted
that
our
traveller
has
rightly
placed
several
other
cities
such
as
scythopolis
hippus
abila
there
were
two
cities
of
this
name
abil
on
the
western
borders
of
the
haouran
appears
to
have
been
the
abila
of
lysanias
which
the
emperors
claudius
and
nero
gave
together
with
batanaea
and
trachonitis
to
herodes
agrippa
joseph
ant
jud
gerasa
amathus
and
he
has
greatly
improved
our
knowledge
of
sacred
geography
by
ascertaining
many
of
the
hebrew
sites
in
the
once
populous
but
now
deserted
region
formerly
known
by
the
names
of
edom
moab
ammon
and
the
country
of
the
amorites
the
principal
geographical
discoveries
of
our
traveller
are
the
nature
of
the
country
between
the
dead
sea
and
the
gulf
of
aelana
now
akaba
the
extent
conformation
and
detailed
topography
of
the
haouran
the
site
of
apameia
on
the
orontes
one
of
the
most
important
cities
of
syria
under
the
macedonian
greeks
the
site
of
petra
which
under
the
romans
gave
the
name
of
arabia
petraea
to
the
surrounding
territory
and
the
general
structure
of
the
peninsula
of
mount
sinai
together
with
many
new
facts
in
its
geography
one
of
the
most
important
of
which
is
the
extent
and
form
of
the
aelanitic
gulf
hitherto
so
imperfectly
known
as
either
to
be
omitted
in
the
maps
or
marked
with
a
bifurcation
at
the
extremity
which
is
now
found
not
to
exist
seetzen
in
the
years
and
had
traversed
a
part
of
the
haouran
to
mezareib
and
draa
had
observed
the
paneium
at
the
source
of
the
jordan
at
banias
had
visited
the
ancient
sites
at
omkeis
ras
abil
djerash
and
amman
and
had
followed
the
route
afterwards
taken
by
burckhardt
through
rabbath
moab
to
kerek
from
whence
he
passed
round
the
southern
extremity
of
the
dead
sea
to
jerusalem
the
public
however
has
never
received
any
more
than
a
very
short
account
of
these
journeys
taken
from
the
correspondence
of
seetzen
with
de
zach
at
this
correspondence
having
been
communicated
to
the
palestine
association
was
translated
and
printed
by
that
society
in
the
year
in
a
quarto
of
pages
he
was
quite
unsuccessful
in
his
inquiries
for
petra
and
having
taken
the
road
which
leads
to
mount
sinai
from
hebron
he
had
no
suspicion
of
the
existence
of
the
long
valley
known
by
the
names
of
el
ghor
and
el
araba
this
prolongation
of
the
valley
of
the
jordan
which
completes
a
longitudinal
separation
of
syria
extending
for
three
hundred
miles
from
the
sources
of
that
river
to
the
eastern
branch
of
the
red
sea
is
a
most
important
feature
in
the
geography
of
the
holy
land
indicating
that
the
jordan
once
discharged
itself
into
the
red
sea
and
confirming
the
truth
of
that
great
volcanic
convulsion
described
in
the
nineteenth
chapter
of
genesis
which
interrupted
the
course
of
the
river
which
converted
into
a
lake
the
fertile
plain
occupied
by
the
cities
of
adma
zeboin
sodom
and
gomorra
and
which
changed
all
the
valley
to
the
southward
of
that
district
into
a
sandy
desert
the
part
of
the
valley
of
the
orontes
below
hamah
in
which
stood
the
greek
cities
of
larissa
and
apameia
has
now
for
the
first
time
been
examined
by
a
scientific
traveller
and
the
large
lake
together
with
the
modern
name
of
famia
which
have
so
long
occupied
a
place
in
the
maps
of
syria
may
henceforth
be
erased
the
country
of
the
nabataei
of
which
petra
was
the
chief
town
is
well
characterized
by
diodorus
diod
as
containing
some
fruitful
spots
but
as
being
for
the
greater
part
desert
and
waterless
with
equal
accuracy
the
combined
information
of
eratosthenes
eratosth
ap
strab
strabo
strabo
and
pliny
plin
hist
describes
petra
as
falling
in
a
line
drawn
from
the
head
of
the
arabian
gulf
suez
to
babylon
as
being
at
the
distance
of
three
or
four
days
from
jericho
and
of
four
or
five
from
phoenicon
which
was
a
place
now
called
moyeleh
on
the
nabataean
coast
near
the
entrance
of
the
aelanitic
gulf
and
as
situated
in
a
valley
of
about
two
miles
in
length
surrounded
with
deserts
inclosed
within
precipices
and
watered
by
a
river
the
latitude
of
degrees
minutes
ascribed
by
ptolemy
to
petra
agrees
moreover
very
accurately
with
that
which
is
the
result
of
the
geographical
information
of
burckhardt
the
vestiges
of
opulence
and
the
apparent
date
of
the
architecture
at
wady
mousa
are
equally
conformable
with
the
remains
of
the
history
of
petra
found
in
strabo
from
whom
it
appears
that
previous
to
the
reign
of
augustus
or
under
the
latter
ptolemies
a
very
large
portion
of
the
commerce
of
arabia
and
india
passed
through
petra
to
the
mediterranean
and
that
armies
of
camels
were
required
to
convey
the
merchandise
from
leuce
come
on
the
red
sea
leuce
come
on
the
coast
of
the
nabataei
was
the
place
from
whence
aelius
gallus
set
out
on
his
unsuccessful
expedition
into
arabia
strabo
ibid
its
exact
situation
is
unknown
through
petra
to
rhinocolura
now
el
arish
but
among
the
ancient
authorities
regarding
petra
none
are
more
curious
than
those
of
josephus
eusebius
and
jerom
all
persons
well
acquainted
with
these
countries
and
who
agree
in
proving
that
the
sepulchre
of
aaron
in
mount
hor
was
near
euseb
et
hieron
onomast
in
greek
text
joseph
ant
for
hence
it
seems
evident
that
the
present
object
of
musulman
devotion
under
the
name
of
the
tomb
of
haroun
stands
upon
the
same
spot
which
has
always
been
regarded
as
the
of
aaron
and
there
remains
little
doubt
therefore
that
the
mountain
to
the
west
of
petra
is
the
mount
hor
of
the
scriptures
mousa
being
perhaps
an
arabic
corruption
of
mosera
where
aaron
is
said
to
have
died
in
addition
to
the
proofs
of
the
site
of
petra
just
stated
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
the
distance
of
roman
miles
from
aila
or
aelana
to
petra
in
the
table
called
theodosian
or
peutinger
when
compared
with
the
distance
on
the
map
gives
a
rate
of
about
of
a
roman
mile
to
the
geographical
mile
in
direct
distance
which
is
not
only
a
correct
rate
but
accords
very
accurately
with
that
resulting
from
the
other
two
routes
leading
from
aila
in
the
table
namely
from
aila
to
clysma
near
the
modern
suez
and
from
aila
to
jerusalem
szadeka
which
burckhardt
visited
to
the
south
of
wady
mousa
agrees
in
distance
and
situation
as
well
as
in
name
with
the
zadagasta
of
the
table
or
zodocatha
of
the
notitiae
dignitatum
imperii
see
reland
palaest
most
of
the
other
places
mentioned
on
the
three
roads
of
the
table
are
noticed
by
ptolemy
or
in
the
notitiae
and
here
the
editor
may
be
permitted
to
add
a
few
words
on
a
third
roman
route
across
these
deserts
having
travelled
the
greater
part
of
it
three
times
namely
that
from
gaza
to
pelusium
in
the
itinerary
of
antoninus
the
places
and
their
interjacent
distances
are
stated
as
follows
gaza
raphia
rhinocolura
ostracine
casium
pentaschoenus
pelusium
the
theodosian
table
agrees
with
the
itinerary
but
is
defective
in
some
of
the
names
and
distances
gerrhae
placed
by
the
table
at
eastward
of
pelusium
is
confirmed
in
this
situation
by
strabo
and
ptolemy
strabo
confirms
the
itinerary
in
regard
to
raphia
omits
to
notice
ostracine
and
in
placing
casium
at
three
hundred
stades
from
pelusium
differs
not
much
from
the
of
the
itinerary
or
the
ten
schoenes
indicated
by
the
word
pentaschoenus
midway
the
name
of
rafa
is
still
preserved
near
a
well
in
the
desert
at
six
hours
march
to
the
southward
of
gaza
where
among
many
remains
of
of
ancient
buildings
two
erect
granite
columns
are
supposed
by
the
natives
to
mark
the
division
between
africa
and
asia
polybius
remarks
that
raphia
was
the
first
town
of
syria
coming
from
rhinocolura
which
was
considered
an
egyptian
town
between
raphia
and
the
easternmost
inundations
of
the
nile
the
only
two
places
at
which
there
is
moisture

between
these
places
except
where
it
has
been
encroached
upon
by
moving
sands
is
a
plain
strongly
impregnated
with
salt
terminatig
towards
the
sea
in
a
lagoon
or
irruption
of
the
sea
anciently
called
sirbonis
as
the
name
of
katieh
and
its
distance
from
tineh
or
pelusium
leave
no
doubt
of
its
being
the
ancient
casium
the
only
remaining
question
is
whether
el
arish
is
rhinocolura
or
ostracine
a
commentary
of
jerom
on
the
nineteenth
chapter
of
isaiah
suggests
the
possibility
that
the
modern
name
el
arish
may
be
a
corruption
of
the
hebrew
ares
which
as
jerom
observes
means
greek
text
and
alludes
to
ostracine
jerom
was
well
acquainted
with
this
country
but
as
the
translators
of
isaiah
have
supposed
the
word
not
to
have
been
ares
and
as
jerom
does
not
state
that
ares
was
a
name
used
in
his
time
the
conjecture
is
not
of
much
weight
it
is
impossible
to
reconcile
the
want
of
water
so
severely
felt
at
ostracine
joseph
de
bel
jud
ad
fin
plutarch
in
anton
gregor
naz
ep
with
el
arish
where
there
are
occasional
torrents
and
seldom
any
scarcity
of
well
water
either
there
or
at
messudieh
two
hours
westward
ostracine
therefore
was
probably
near
the
greek
text
of
the
lagoon
sirbonis
about
between
el
arish
and
katieh
on
the
bank
described
by
strabo
which
separates
the
sirbonis
from
the
sea
this
maritime
position
of
ostracine
is
confirmed
by
the
march
of
titus
joseph
ibid
leaving
the
limits
of
the
pelusiac
territory
he
moved
across
the
desert
on
the
first
day
not
to
the
modern
katieh
but
to
the
temple
of
jupiter
at
mount
casium
on
the
sea
shore
at
the
cape
now
called
ras
kasaroun
on
the
second
day
to
ostracine
on
the
third
to
rhinocolura
on
the
fourth
to
raphia
on
the
fifth
to
gaza
it
will
be
seen
by
the
map
that
these
positions
as
now
settled
furnished
exactly
five
convenient
marches
the
two
longest
being
naturally
through
the
desert
of
total
privation
which
lies
between
el
arish
and
katieh
as
the
modern
route
instead
of
following
the
sea
shore
passes
to
the
southward
of
the
lagoon
the
site
of
ostracine
has
not
yet
been
explored
it
would
seem
from
the
evidence
regarding
petra
which
may
be
collected
in
ancient
history
that
neither
in
the
ages
prior
to
the
commercial
opulence
of
the
nabataei
nor
after
they
were
deprived
of
it
was
wady
mousa
the
position
of
their
principal
town
when
the
macedonian
greeks
first
became
acquainted
with
this
part
of
syria
by
means
of
the
expedition
which
antigonus
sent
against
the
nabataei
under
the
command
of
his
son
demetrius
we
are
informed
by
diodorus
that
these
arabs
placed
their
old
men
women
and
children
upon
a
certain
rock
greek
text
steep
unfortified
by
walls
admitting
only
of
one
access
to
the
summit
and
situated
stades
beyond
the
lake
asphaltitis
diod
sic
as
this
interval
agrees
with
that
of
kerek
from
the
southern
extremity
of
the
dead
sea
and
is
not
above
half
the
distance
of
wady
mousa
from
the
same
point
and
as
the
other
parts
of
the
description
are
well
adapted
to
kerek
while
they
are
inapplicable
to
wady
mousa
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
kerek
was
at
that
time
the
fortress
of
the
nabataei
and
that
during
the
first
ages
of
the
intercourse
of
that
people
with
the
greeks
it
was
known
to
the
latter
by
the
name
petra
so
often
applied
by
them
to
barbarian
when
the
effects
of
commerce
required
a
situation
better
suited
than
kerek
to
the
collected
population
and
increased
opulence
of
the
nabataei
the
appellation
of
petra
was
transferred
to
the
new
city
at
wady
mousa
which
place
had
before
been
known
to
the
greeks
by
the
name
of
arce
greek
text
a
corruption
perhaps
of
the
hebrew
joseph
antiq
jud
to
wady
mousa
although
of
a
very
different
aspect
from
kerek
the
name
petra
was
equally
well
adapted
and
kerek
then
became
distinguished
among
the
greeks
by
its
indigenous
name
in
the
greek
form
of
charax
to
which
the
romans
added
that
of
omanorum
or
kerek
of
ammon
plin
hist
nat
to
distinguish
it
from
another
kerek
now
called
kerek
el
shobak
the
former
kerek
was
afterwards
restored
by
the
christians
to
the
jewish
division
of
moab
to
which
being
south
of
the
river
arnon
it
strictly
belonged
and
it
was
then
called
in
greek
charagmoba
under
which
name
we
find
it
mentioned
as
one
of
the
cities
and
episcopal
dioceses
of
the
third
hierocl
synecd
notit
episc
graec
when
the
stream
of
commerce
which
had
enriched
the
nabataei
had
partly
reverted
to
its
old
egyptian
channel
and
had
partly
taken
the
new
course
which
created
a
palmyra
in
the
midst
of
a
country
still
more
destitute
of
the
commonest
gifts
of
nature
then
arabia
petraea
a
comparison
of
the
architecture
at
wady
mousa
and
at
tedmour
strengthens
the
opinion
that
palmyra
flourished
at
a
period
later
than
petra
wady
mousa
was
gradually
depopulated
its
river
however
and
the
intricate
recesses
of
its
rocky
valleys
still
attract
and
give
security
to
a
tribe
of
arabs
but
the
place
being
defensible
only
by
considerable
numbers
and
being
situated
in
a
less
fertile
country
than
kerek
was
less
adapted
to
be
the
chief
town
of
the
nabataei
when
they
had
returned
to
their
natural
state
of
divided
wanderers
or
small
agricultural
communities
the
greek
bishopricks
of
the
third
palestine
were
obliterated
by
the
musulman
conquest
with
the
sole
exception
of
the
metropolitan
petra
whose
titular
bishop
still
resides
at
jerusalem
and
occasionally
visits
kerek
as
being
the
only
place
in
his
province
which
contains
a
christian
community
hence
kerek
has
been
considered
the
see
of
the
bishoprick
of
petra
and
hence
has
arisen
the
erroneous
opinion
often
adopted
by
travellers
from
the
christians
of
jerusalem
that
kerek
is
the
site
of
the
ancient
capital
of
arabia
petraea
the
haouran
being
only
once
mentioned
in
the
sacred
writings
ezekiel
xlvii
was
probably
of
inconsiderable
extent
under
the
jews
but
enlarged
its
boundaries
under
the
greeks
and
romans
by
whom
it
was
called
auranitis
it
has
been
still
farther
increased
since
that
time
and
now
includes
not
only
auranitis
but
ituraea
also
or
ittur
of
which
djedour
is
perhaps
a
corruption
together
with
the
greater
part
of
basan
or
batanaea
and
trachonitis
burckhardt
seems
not
to
have
been
aware
of
the
important
comment
upon
trachonitis
afforded
by
his
description
of
the
singular
rocky
wilderness
of
the
ledja
and
by
the
inscriptions
which
he
copied
at
missema
in
that
district
see
it
appears
from
these
inscriptions
that
missema
was
anciently
the
town
of
the
phaenesii
and
the
metrocomia
or
chief
place
of
trachon
the
descriptions
of
which
district
by
strabo
and
josephus
strabo
joseph
antiq
jud
are
in
exact
conformity
with
that
which
burckhardt
has
given
us
of
the
ledja
from
strabo
and
ptolemy
strabo
ibid
ptolemy
we
learn
that
trachonitis
comprehended
all
the
uneven
country
extending
along
the
eastern
side
of
the
plain
of
haouran
from
near
damascus
to
boszra
it
was
in
consequence
of
the
predatory
incursions
of
the
arabs
from
the
secure
recesses
of
the
ledja
into
the
neighbouring
plains
that
augustus
transferred
the
government
of
trachonitis
from
zenodorus
who
was
accused
of
encouraging
them
to
herod
king
of
judaea
joseph
antiq
de
bell
the
two
trachones
into
which
trachonitis
was
divided
agree
with
the
two
natural
divisions
of
the
ledja
and
djebel
haouran
oerman
an
ancient
ruin
at
the
foot
of
the
djebel
haouran
to
the
east
of

from
an
inscription
copied
there
by
burckhardt
to
be
the
site
of

a
town
founded
by

a

of
palestine
and
that
the
adjective
phaenesius
is
applied
to
some
mines
at

it
seems
evident
that
these

different

very
nearly
confirmed
by

between

it
will
be
seen
by
the

that
the

have
made

a
place

importance

and
therefore
excited
the
wonder
of
our
traveller
at
its
having
preserved
only
some
very
scanty
relics
of
antiquity
although
mount

the
deserts
lying
between

peninsula

have
not
like
the
latter
country
preserved
many
of
the
names
of
holy
scripture
the
new
information
of
burckhardt
contains
many
facts
in
regard
to
their
geography
and
natural
history
which
may
be
useful
in
tracing
the
progress
of
the
israelites
from
egypt
into
syria
the
bitter

the

to
be
the
station
named

at
which
the
israelites
found
twelve
wells
of

it
is
remarkable
that

only
places
in

exactly
with

part

moses
first
gave
his
followers
the
sweet
substance
gathered
in
the

them

during
their
long
wandering

wady
el

is
the
only
open

easy
passage

it
requires
the
traveller
to
pass
for
some
distance
along
the
sea
shore
after
leaving
gharendel
as
we
are
informed
that
the
israelites
actually
did
on
leaving
elim

the
upper
region
of

forms
an
irregular
circle

numerous
sources

a
temperate
climate

a
soil
capable

the
part
of

adapted
to
the
residence

the
report
which
they
brought
back
was
no
less
favourable
to
the
fertility

it
was
discouraging
by
its
description
of
the
warlike
spirit
and
preparation
of
the
inhabitants
and
of
the
strength
of
the
fortified
places

the
israelites

in
consequence
refused

punished
by
that
long
wandering
in
the
deserts
lying
between
egypt
judaea
and
mount

which
the
sacred
historian
has
not
left
us
any
details

course

the
israelites
obtained
some
advantages
over
the
neighbouring
canaanites

but
giving
up
at
length
all
hope
of
penetrating
by
the
frontier
which
lies
between
gaza
and
the
dead

they
turned
to

view
of
making
a
circuit
through
the
countries

the
southern

eastern
sides
of

here
however
they
found
the
difficulty
still
greater
mount

under
the
modern
names
of

forms
a
ridge

traversed
from

the
ghoeyr
alone
furnishes
an
entrance
that
would
not
be
extremely
difficult
to
a
hostile
force
this
perhaps
was
the
high
way
by
which
moses
aware
of
the
difficulty
of
forcing
a
passage
and
endeavouring
to
obtain
his
object
by
negotiation
requested
the
edomites
to
let
him
pass
on
the
condition
of
his
leaving
the
fields

untouched

of
purchasing

edom

to
give

passage
through

came
out
against
him

much
people

with

strong
hand
numbers
the
situation
of
the
israelites
therefore
was
very
critical
unable
to
force
their
way
in
either
direction

having
enemies

the
edomites
in

the
canaanites

be

through
the
countries
beyond
the
dead
sea
furnishes
a
most
satisfactory
illustration
of
the
sacred
historians
it
remains
for
the
editor
only
to
add
that
while
correcting
the
foreign
idiom
of
his
author
and
making
numerous
alterations
in
the
structure
of
the
language
he
has
been
as
careful
as
posible
not
to
injure
the
originality
of
the
composition
stamped
as
it
is
with
the
simplicity
good
sense
and
candour
inseparable
from
the
character
in
the
editor
wish
however
to
preserve
this
originality
he
can
not
flatter
himself
that
incorrect
expressions
may
not
sometimes
have
been
left
in
regard
to
the
greek
inscriptions
he
thinks
it
necessary
only
to
remark
that
although
the
propriety
of
furnishing
the
reader
with
of
all
such
interesting
relicts
of
ancient
history
can
not
in
general
be
doubted
yet
in
the
present
instance
the
trouble
and
expense
which
it
would
have
occasioned
would
hardly
have
been
compensated
by
the
importance
of
the
monuments
themselves
or
by
the
degree
of
correctness
with
which
they
were
copied
by
the
traveller
they
have
therefore
been
printed
in
a
type
nearly
resembling
the
greek
characters
which
were
in
use
at
the
date
of
the
inscriptions
and
the
editor
has
taken
the
liberty
of
separating
the
words
and
of
supplying
in
the
small
cursive
greek
character
the
defective
parts
of
the
traveller
copies
the
editor
takes
this
opportunity
of
stating
that
in
consequence
of
some
discoveries
in
african
geography
which
have
been
made
known
since
the
publication
of
burckhardt
travels
in
nubia
he
has
made
some
alterations
in
the
maps
of
the
second
edition
of
that
work
the
observations
of
captain
lyon
have
proved
morzouk
to
be
situated
a
degree
and
a
half
to
the
southward
of
the
position
formerly
assigned
to
it
and
his
enquiries
having
at
the
same
time
confirmed
the
bearing
and
distance
between
morzouk
and
bornou
as
reported
by
former
travellers
a
corresponding
change
will
follow
in
the
latitude
of
bornou
as
well
as
in
the
position
of
the
places
on
the
route
leading
to
those
two
cities
from
the
countries
of
the
nile
a
journey
into
nubia
by
the
earl
of
belmore
and
his
brother
the
hon
capt
corry
has
furnished
some
latitudes
and
longitudes
serving
to
correct
the
map
of
the
course
of
the
nile
from
assouan
to
the
confines
of
dongola
which
the
editor
constructed
from
the
journals
of
burckhardt
without
the
assistance
of
any
celestial
observatians
the
error
in
the
map
as
to
the
most
distant
point
observed
by
lord
belmore
is
however
so
small
that
it
has
not
been
thought
necessary
to
make
any
alteration
in
that
map
for
the
second
edition
of
burckhardt
journey
in
nubia
but
the
whole
delineation
of
this
part
of
the
nile
will
be
corrected
from
the
recent
observations
in
a
new
edition
of
the
supplement
to
the
editor
general
map
of
egypt
since
the
journey
of
lord
belmore
waddington
and
hanbury
taking
advantage
of
an
expedition
sent
into
aethiopia
by
the
viceroy
of
egypt
have
prolonged
the
examination
of
the
nile
four
hundred
miles
beyond
the
extreme
point
reached
by
burckhardt
and
some
french
gentlemen
have
continued
to
follow
the
army
as
far
as
sennaar
the
presence
of
a
turkish
army
in
that
country
will
probably
furnish
greater
facilities
for
exploring
the
bahr
el
abiad
or
western
branch
of
the
nile
than
have
ever
before
been
presented
to
travellers
there
is
reason
to
hope
that
the
opportunity
will
not
be
neglected
and
thus
a
survey
of
this
celebrated
river
from
its
sources
to
the
mediterranean
may
perhaps
at
length
be
made
if
not
for
the
first
time
for
the
first
time
at
least
since
the
extinction
of
egyptian
science
the
expedition
of
the
pasha
of
egypt
has
already
produced
some
important
additions
to
african
geography
by
permission
of
waddington
the
editor
has
corrected
from
that
gentleman
delineation
the
parts
of
the
nile
above
mahass
for
the
second
edition
of
nubia
and
from
the
information
transmitted
to
england
by
salt
he
has
been
enabled
to
insert
in
the
same
map
the
position
of
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
city
situated
about
miles
to
the
of
shendy
these
ruins
had
already
been
partially
seen
by
bruce
and
burckhardt
burckhardt
passed
through
the
vestiges
of
what
seems
to
have
been
a
dependency
of
this
city
on
the
nile
at
seven
hours
to
the
north
of
shendy
and
two
hours
to
the
south
of
djebail
the
latter
name
which
is
applied
by
burckhardt
to
a
large
village
on
a
range
of
hills
is
evidently
the
same
as
the
mount
gibbainy
where
bruce
observed
the
same
ruins
which
have
now
been
more
completely
explored
by
cailliaud
see
travels
in
nubia
bruce
travels
vol
iv
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
bruce
was
right
in
supposing
them
to
be
the
remains
of
meroe
the
capital
of
the
great
peninsula
of
the
same
name
of
which
the
general
geography
appears
to
have
been
known
with
considerable
accuracy
to
men
of
science
in
the
augustan
age
although
it
had
not
been
visited
by
any
of
the
writers
whose
works
have
reached
us
for
assuming
to
illustrate
the
following
observations
as
well
as
some
of
the
preceding
a
small
drawing
of
the
course
of
the
nile
is
inserted
in
the
margin
of
the
map
of
syria
which
accompanies
the
present
volume
these
ruins
to
mark
the
site
of
the
city
meroe
and
that
the
latitude
and
longitude
of
shendy
have
been
accurately
determined
by
bruce
whose
instruments
were
good
and
whose
competency
to
the
task
of
observation
is
undoubted
it
will
be
found
that
ptolemy
is
very
nearly
right
in
ascribing
the
latitude
of
to
the
city
ptolem
pliny
plin
hist
nat
is
equally
correct
in
stating
that
the
two
points
of
the
ecliptic
in
which
the
sun
is
in
the
zenith
at
meroe
are
the
degree
of
taurus
and
the
degree
of
leo
the
stades
which
strabo

p
and
pliny

we
learn
from
another
passage
in
pliny
that
the
persons
sent
by
nero
to
explore
the
nile
measured
miles
by
the
river
from
syene
to
meroe
assert
to
be
the
distance
between
meroe
and
syene
is
correct
at
a
rate
of
between
and
stades
to
the
geographical
mile
if
the
line
be
taken
in
direct
distance
as
evidently
appears
to
have
been
the
intention
of
strabo
by
his
thrice
stating
upon
the
authority
of
eratosthenes
that
the
distance
from
meroe
to
alexandria
was
eratosth
ap
strab
strabo
the
latitudes
of
ptolemy
equally
accord
in
shewing
the
equidistance
of
syene
from
meroe
and
from
alexandria
the
latitude
of
syene
being
stated
by
him
at
ptolem
and
that
of

at

the
description
of
the
island
of

being

calls

answers
to
that
which

describes
as
the
port
of
meroe
and
finally
the
distance
of
days
to
a
good
walker
which
artemidorus
artemid
ibid
places
between
meroe
and
the
sea
giving
a
rate
of
about
english
miles
in
direct
distance
is
a
correct
statement
of
the
actual
distance
between
the
ruins
near
shendy
and
souakin
it
is
fair
to
remark
that
there
are
two
authorities
which
tend
to
place
the
city
of
meroe
or
miles
to
the
southward
of
the
ruins
near
shendy
eratosthenes
states
it
to
have
been
at
stades
and
pliny
at
miles
above
the
confluence
but
it
is
rare
indeed
to
find
a
coincidence
of
many
ancient
authorities
in
a
question
where
numbers
are
concerned
unless
one
author
has
borrowed
from
another
which
is
probably
the
case
in
regard
to
the
two
just
quoted
it
will
hardly
be
contested
that
the
modern
name
of
merawe
which
is
found
attached
to
a
town
near
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
city
discovered
by
waddington
and
hanbury
in
the
country
of
the
sheygya
is
sufficient
to
overthrow
the
strong
evidence
just
stated
it
may
rather
be
inferred
that
the
greek
meroe
was
formed
from
a
word
signifying
city
in
the
ancient
aethiopic
language
which
has
continued
up
to
the
present
time
to
be
attached
to
the
site
of
one
of
the
chief
cities
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
thus
resembling
in
its
origin
many
names
of
places
in
various
countries
which
from
simple
nouns
expressive
in
the
original
language
of
objects
or
their
qualities
such
as
city
mountain
river
sacred
white
blue
black
have
been
converted
by
foreigners
into
proper
names
the
ruins
near
merawe
seem
to
those
of
napata
the
chief
town
of
the
country
intermediate
between
meroe
and
egypt
and
which
was
taken
by
the
praefect
petronius
in
the
reign
of
augustus
when
it
was
the
capital
of
queen
candace
ptolem
strabo
plin
hist
for
pliny
on
the
authority
of
the
persons
sent
by
nero
to
explore
the
river
above

states
roman
miles
to
have
been
the
interval
between
syene
and
napata
and
miles
to
have
been
that
between
napata
and
meroe
which
distances
correspond
more
nearly
than
could
have
been
expected
with
the
real
distances
between
assouan
merawe
and
shendy
taken
along
the
general
curve
of
the
river
without
considering
the
windings
in
detail
we
must
not
however
too
confidently
pronounce
on
real
distances
until
we
possess
a
few
more
positions
fixed
by
astronomical
observations
the
island
of
argo
from
its
extent
its
important
ruins
its
fertility
as
well
as
from
the
similarity
of
name
seems
to
be
the
gora
of
juba
ap
plin
ibid
or
the
gagaudes
which
the
explorers
of
nero
reported
to
be
situated
at
miles
below
napata
in
placing
napata
at
the
ruins
near
mérawe
it
is
necessary
to
abandon
the
evidence
of
ptolemy
whose
latitude
of
napata
is
widely
different
from
that
of
merawe
and
as
we
also
find
that
he
is
considerably
in
error
in
regard
to
the
only
point
between
syene
and
meroe
hitherto
ascertained
namely
the
great
cataract
which
he
places
minutes
to
the
north
of
wady
halfa
still
less
can
we
rely
upon
his
authority
for
the
position
of
the
obscurer
towns
although
the
extreme
northern
point
to
which
the
nile
descends
below
berber
before
it
turns
to
the
south
is
not
yet
accurately
determined
in
latitude
nor
the
degree
of
southern
latitude
which
the
river
reaches
before
it
finally
takes
the
northern
course
which
it
continues
to
the
mediterranean
we
can
not
doubt
that
eratosthenes
had
received
a
tolerably
correct
account
of
its
general
course
from
the
egyptians
notwithstanding
his
incorrectness
in
regard
to
the
proportionate
length
of
the
great
turnings
of
the
river
the
nile
he
says
after
having
flowed
to
the
north
from
meroe
for
the
space
of
stades
turns
to
the
south
and
southwest
for
stades
entering
very
far
into
lybia
until
it
arrives
in
the
latitude
of
meroe
then
making
a
new
turn
it
flows
to
the
north
for
the
space
of
stades
to
the
great
cataract
whence
inclining
a
little
eastward
it
traverses
stades
to
the
small
cataract
of
syene
and
then
stades
to
the
ap
strab
the
only
mode
of
reconciling
these
numbers
to
the
truth
is
to
suppose
the
three
first
of
them
to
have
been
taken
with
all
the
windings
of
the
stream
the
two
last
in
a
direct
line
and
even
then
they
can
not
be
very
accurate
the
nile
receives
two
rivers
which
descending
from
certain
lakes
surround
the
great
island
of
meroe
that
which
flows
on
the
eastern
side
is
called
astaboras
the
other
is
the
astapus
though
some
say
it
is
the
astasobas
this
ambiguity
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
observe
was
caused
by
the
greater
magnitude
of
the
astasobas
or
bahr

or

which
caused
it
to
give
name
to

dumar
september
we
set
off
before
daylight
crossing
the
mountains
in
one
of
whose
wadys
wady
valley
the
barrada
winds
along
we
crossed
it
repeatedly
and
after
two
hours
arrived
at
the
village
eldjdide
arabic
built
on
the
declivity
of
a
hill
near
the
source
of
one
of
the
numerous
rivulets
that
empty
themselves
into
the
barrada
one
hour
and
three
quarters
further
we
descended
into
the
wady
barrada
near
two
villages
built
on
either
side
of
the
river
opposite
to
each
other
called
souk
barrada
souk
market
is
an
appellation
often
added
to
villages
which
have
periodical
markets
the
valley
of
the
barrada
up
to
djissr
barrada
is
full
of
fruit
trees
and
where
its
breadth
permits
dhourra
and
wheat
are
sown
half
an
hour
further
is
husseine
a
small
village
in
the

here
the
wady
begins
to
be
very
narrow
a
quarter
of
an
hour
beyond
turning
round
a
steep
rock
the
valley
presents
a
very
wild
and
picturesque
aspect
to
the
left
in
the
mountain
are
six
chambers
cut
in
the
rock
said
to
be
the
work
of
christians
to
whom
the
greater
part
of
the
ancient
structures
in
syria
are
ascribed
the
river
was
not
fordable
here
and
it
would
have
taken
me
at
least
two
hours
to
reach
by
a
circuitous
route
the
opposite
mountains
a
little
way
higher
up
is
the
djissr
el
souk
at
the
termination
of
the
wady
this
bridge
was
built
last
year
as
appears
by
an
arabic
inscription
on
the
rock
near
it
from
the
bridge
the
road
leads
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
and
enters
after
half
an
hour
ride
upon
a
plain
country
the
river
has
a
pretty
cascade
near
which
are

the

empties
itself
into

has
besides

of
the

barrada
half
an
hour
from
the
village
husseine
the
fall
of
the

is
very
rapid
we
followed
the
plain
of
zebdeni
from
one
end
to
the
other
it
is
limited
on
one
side
by
the
eastern
part
of

its
cultivable
ground
is
waste
till
near
the
village
of
beroudj

where
i
saw
plantations
of
mulberry
trees
which
seemed
to
be
well
taken

had
a
letter
for
the

ordered
me
an
argile
argile
a
persian
pipe
in

the

passes
through
water
and
a
cup
of
coffee
but
went
to
supper
with
his
household
without
inviting
me
to
join
them
this
being
considered
an
insult
i
left
his
house
and
went
to
sup
with
the
muleteers
with
whom
i
slept
upon
an
open
piece
of
ground
before
a
ruined
bath
in
the

greek
catholics
it
is
a
place
much
frequented
by
those
passing
from

september
left
the

but
that
part
of
it
which
lies
nearer
to
zebdeni
than
to
the
great

called
djebel
zebdeni
we
travelled
for
the
greater
part
of
the
morning
upon
the
mountain
its
rock
is
primitive
calcareous
of
a
fine
grain
upon
the
highest
part
i
found
a
sandy
slate
on
the
summit
and
on
the
eastern
side
of
this
part
of
the
there
are
many
spots
affording
good
pasturage
where
a

sometimes
feed
their
cattle
it
abounds
also
in
short
oak

of
which
i
saw
none
higher
than
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
our
road
lay
two
hours
and
a
half
from
zebdeni
we
passed
a
spot
with
several
wells
called
bir

anhaur
or
bekai
the
western
declivity
of
the
mountain
towards
the
district
of
baalbec
is
completely
barren
without
pasture
or
trees
after
five
hours
and
three
quarters
riding
we
descended
into
the
plain
near
the
village
of
el
kanne
arabic
and
passed
the
river
of
el
kanne
whose
source
is
at
three
hours
distance
in
the
mountain
it
empties
itself
into
the
liettani
in
the
plain
two
hours
below
kanne
i
here
left
the
caravan
and
took
a
guide
to
zahle
where
i
meant
to
stay
a
few
days
our
way
lay
across
the
plain
passed
the
village
el

consisting
of
miserable
mud
cottages
the

is
almost
totally
uncultivated
passed
the

at
two

half
an

on
the

it
consists
of
about
one
hundred

and
has
some

are
watered
by
a
branch
of
the
berdoun

kerak
is
entirely
inhabited
by
turks
it
belongs
to
zahle
the
dominions
of
the
emir
of
the
druses
who
some
years
ago
took
it
by
force
from
the
emir
of
baalbec
on
the
southern
side
of
the
village
is
a
mosque
and
adjoining
to
it
a
long
building
on
the
eastern
side
of
which
are
the
ruins
of
another
mosque
with
a
kubbe
still
remaining
the
long
building
contains
under
a
flat
roof
the
pretended
tomb
of

it
consists
of
a
above
ten
feet
long
three
broad
and
two
high
plastered
all
over
the
direction
of
its

and
the
turks
visit
the
grave
and
pretend
that
noah
is
really
buried
there
at
half
an
hour
from
kerak
is
the
town
of
zahle
arabic
built
in
an
inlet
of
the
mountain
on
a
steep
ascent
surrounded
with
kerums
vineyards
the
river
berdoun
arabic
here
issues
from
a
narrow
valley
into
the
plain
and
waters
the
gardens
of
zahle
september
took
a
walk
through
the
town
with
sheikh
hadj
farakh
there
are
eight
or
nine
hundred
houses
which
daily
increase
by
fugitives
from
the
oppressions
of
the
pashas
of
damascus
and
of
the
neighbouring
petty
tyrants
years
ago
there
were
only
two
hundred
houses
at
zahle
it
is
now
one
of
the
principal
towns
in
the
territory
of
the
emir
beshir
it
has
its
markets
which
are
supplied
from
damascus
and
beirout
and
are
visited
by
the
neighbouring
fellahs
and
the
arabs
el
naim
and
el
harb
and
el
faddel
part
of
whom
pass
the
winter
months
in
the
bekaa
and
exchange
their
butter
against
articles
of
dress
and
tents
and
horse
and
camel
furniture
the
inhabitants
who
may
amount
to
five
thousand
are
all
catholic
greeks
with
the
exception
only
of
four
or
five
turkish
families
the
christians
have
a
bishop
five
churches
and
a
monastery
the
turks
have
no
mosque
the
town
belongs
to
the
territory
of
the
druses
and
is
under
the
authority
of
the
emir
beshir
but
a
part
of
it
still
belongs
to
the
family
of
aamara
whose
influence
formerly
very
great
in
the
mountain
has
lately
been
so
much
circumscribed
by
the
emir
that
the
latter
is
now
absolute
master
of
the
town
the
emir
receives
the
miri
which
is
commonly
the
double
of
its
original
assessment
in
belad
baalbec
it
is
the
triple
and
besides
the
miri
he
makes
occasional
demands
upon
the
town
at
large
they
had
paid
him
purses
a
few
weeks
before
my
arrival
so
far
the
emir
beshir
government
resembles
perfectly
that
of
the
osmanlys
in
the
eastern
part
of
syria
but
there
is
one
great
advantage
which
the
people
enjoy
under
his
command
an
almost
complete
exemption
from
all
personal
exactions
and
the
impartiality
of
justice
which
is
dealt
out
in
the
same
manner
to
the
christian
and
to
the
turk
it
is
curious
that
the
peace
of
so
numerous
a
body
should
be
maintained
without
any
legal
power
whatsoever
there
is
neither
sheikh
nor
governor
in
the
town
disputes
are
settled
by
the
friends
of
the
respective
parties
or
if
the
latter
are
obstinate
the
decision
is
referred
to
the
tribunal
of
the
emir
beshir
at
deir
el
kammar
the
inhabitants
though
not
rich
are
in
general
in
independent
circumstances
each
family
occupies
one
or
at
most
two
rooms
the
houses
are
built
of
mud
the
roofs
are
supported
by
one
or
two
wooden
posts
in
the
midst
of
the
principal
room
over
which
beams
of
are
laid
across
each
other
upon
these
are
branches
of
oak
trees
and
then
the
earth
which
forms
the
flat
terrace
of
the
house
in
winter
the
deep
snow
would
soon
break
through
these
feeble
roofs
did
not
the
inhabitants
take
care
every
morning
to
remove
the
snow
that
may
have
fallen
during
the
night
the
people
gain
their
subsistence
partly
by
the
cultivation
of
their
vineyards
and
a
few
mulberry
plantations
or
of
their
fields
in
the
bekaa
and
partly
by
their
shops
by
the
commerce
in
kourdine
sheep
and
their
manufactures
almost
every
family
weaves
cotton
cloth
which
is
used
as
shirts
by
the
inhabitants
and
arabs
and
when
dyed
blue
as
kombazes
or
gowns
by
the
men
there
are
more
than
twenty
dyeing
houses
in
zahle
in
which
indigo
only
is
employed
the
pike
the
pike
is
a
linear
measure
equal
to
two
feet
english
when
used
for
goods
of
home
manufacture
and
inches
for
foreign
imported
commodities
of
the
best
of
this
cotton
cloth
a

costs
fifty

the
cotton
is
brought
from
belad
safad
and
nablous
they
likewise
fabricate
abbayes
or
woollen
mantles
there
are
above
one
hundred
horsemen
in
the
town
in
june
when
the
emir
beshir
joined
with
his
corps
the
army
of
soleiman
pasha
to
depose
youssef
pasha
he
took
from
zahle
men
armed
with
firelocks
on
the
west
side
of
the
town
in
the
bottom
of
the
wady
lies
the
monastery
of
mar
elias
inhabited
by
a
prior
and
twenty
monks
it
has
extensive
grape
and
mulberry
plantations
and
on
the
river
side
a
well
cultivated
garden
the
products
of
which
are
sold
to
the
town
people
the
prior
received
me
with
great
arrogance
because
i
did
not
stoop
to
kiss
his
hands
a
mark
of
respect
which
the
ecclesiastics
of
this
country
are
accustomed
to
receive
the
river
of
zahle
or
berdoun
forms
the
frontier
of
the
bekaa
which
it
separates
from
the
territory
belonging
to
the
emir
of
baalbec
called
belad
baalbec
so
that
whatever
is
northward
from
the
bridge
of
the
berdoun
situated
in
the
valley
a
quarter
of
an
hour
below
zahle
belongs
to
belad
baalbec
and
whatever
is
to
the
bekaa
since
soleiman
pasha
has
governed
damascus
the
authority
of
the
emir
beshir
has
been
in
some
measure
extended
over
the
bekaa
but
i
could
not
inform
myself
of
the
distinct
laws
by
which
it
had
been
regulated
the
pashas
of
damascus
and
the
emir
beshirs
have
for
many
years
been
in
continual
dispute
about
their
rights
over
the
villages
of
the
bekaa
andjar
following
up
the
berdoun
into
the
mountain
are
the
villages
of
atein
heraike
and
another
in
the
vicinity
of
zahle
september
on
the
night
of
the
to
the
was
the
aid
essalib
or
feast
of
the
cross
the
approach
of
which
was
celebrated
by
repeated
discharges
of
musquets
and
the
lighting
of
numerous
fires
which
illuminated
all
the
mountains
around
the
town
and
the
most
conspicuous
parts
of
the
town
itself
i
rode
to
andjar
arabic
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
bekaa
in
a
direction
by
south
two
hours
and
a
half
good
walking
from
zahle
i
found
several
encampments
of
the
arabs
naim
and
faddel
in
the
plain
in
one
hour
and
a
quarter
passed
the
liettani
near
an
ancient
arched
bridge
it
had
very
little
water
not
the
sixth
part
of
the
plain
is
cultivated
here
the
place
called
andjar
lies
near
the
and
consists
of
a
ruined
inclosing
an
oblong
square
of
half
an
hour
in
circumference
the
greater
part
of
the
wall
is
in
ruins
it
was
originally
about
twelve
feet
thick
and
constructed
with
small
unhewn
stones
loosely
cemented
and
covered
by
larger
square
stones
equally
ill
cemented
in
the
enclosed
space
are
the
ruins
of
habitations
of
which
the
foundations
alone
remain
in
one
of
these
buildings
are
seen
the
remains
of
two
columns
of
white
marble
one
foot
and
a
quarter
in
diameter
the
whole
seems
to
have
been
constructed
in
modern
times
following
the
mountain
to
the
southward
of
these
ruins
for
twenty
minutes
i
came
to
the
place
where
the
moiet
andjar
or
river
of
andjar
has
its
source
in
several
springs
this
river
had
when
i
saw
it
more
than
triple
the
volume
of
water
of
the
liettani
but
though
it
joins
the
latter
in
the
bekaa
near
djissr
temnin
the
united
stream
retains
the
name
liettani
there
are
remains
of
ancient
walls
round
all
the
springs
which
constitute
the
source
of
the
andjar
one
of
the
springs
in
particular
which
forms
a
small
but
very
deep
basin
has
been
lined
to
the
bottom
with
large
stones
and
the
wall
round
it
has
been
constructed
with
large
square
stones
which
have
no
traces
of
ever
having
been
cemented
together
in
the
wall
of
a
mill
which
has
been
built
very
near
these
springs
i
saw
a
sculptured
architrave
these
remains
appear
to
be
much
more
ancient
than
those
of
andjar
and
are
perhaps
coeval
with
the
buildings
at
baalbec
i
was
told
by
the
people
of
the
mill
that
the
water
of
the
larger
spring
in
summer
time
stops
at
certain
periods
and
resumes
its
issue
from
under
the
rock
eight
or
ten
times
in
a
day
further
up
in
the
mountain
above
the
spring
is
a
large
cavern
where
the
people
sometimes
collect
saltpetre
but
it
is
more
abundant
in
a
cavern
still
higher
in
the
mountain
following
the
road
northward
on
the
chain
of
the
half
an
hour
from
these
springs
i
met
with
another
copious
spring
and
a
little
higher
a
third
one
hour
further
is
a
fourth
which
i
did
not
visit
near
the
two
former
are
traces
of
ancient
walls
the
waters
of
all
these
sources
join
in
moiet
andjar
and
they
are
all
comprised
under
the
appellation
of
the
springs
of
moiet
andjar
arabic
they
are
partly
covered
with
rushes
and
are
much
frequented
by
water
fowls
and
wild
boars
also
resort
to
them
in
great
numbers
august
being
disappointed
in
my
object
of
proceeding
to
baalbec
i
passed
the
day
in
the
shop
of
one

the

extends
as
i
have
before
mentioned
down
to
the
bekaa
on
the
eastern
side
it
comprises
the
mountain
of

up
to
its
top
and
on
the
western
side
the

likewise

it
reaches
as

as
el

twelve
hours
from
baalbec
and
fourteen
hours
from
homs
where
the
terminates
and
where
the
valley
between
the
two
mountains
widens
considerably
because
the
there
takes
a
more
eastern
direction
this
district
is
abundantly
watered
by
rivulets
almost
every
village
has
its
spring
all
of
which
descend
into
the
valley
where
most
of
them
lose
themselves
or
join
the
liettani
whose
source
is
between
zahle
and
baalbec
about
two
hours
from
the
latter
place
near
a
hill
called
tel
hushben
the
earth
is
extremely
fertile
but
is
still
less
cultivated
than
in
the
bekaa
even
so
late
as
twelve
years
ago
the
plain
and
a
part
of
the
mountain
to
the
distance
of
a
league
and
a
half
round
the
town
were
covered
with
grape
plantations
the
oppressions
of
the
governors
and
their
satellites
have
now
entirely
destroyed
them
and
the
inhabitants
of
baalbec
instead
of
eating
their
own
grapes
which
were
renowned
for
their
superior
flavour
are
obliged
to
import
them
from
fursul
and
zahle
the
government
of
baalbec
has
been
for
many
years
in
the
hands
of
the
family
of
harfush
the
head
family
of
the
metaweli
of
syria
the
metaweli
are
of
the
sect
of
ali
like
the
persians
they
have
more
than
houses
at
damascus
but
they
conform
there
to
the
rites
of
the
orthodox
mohammedans
in
later
times
two
brothers
djahdjah
and
sultan
have
disputed
with
each
other
the
possession
of
the
government
more
than
fifteen
individuals
of
their
own
family
have
perished
in
these
contests
and
they
have
dispossessed
each
other
by
turns
according
to
the
degree
of
friendship
or
enmity
which
the
pashas
of
damascus
bore
to
the
one
or
the
other
during
the
reign
of
youssef
pasha
sultan
was
emir
as
soon
as
soleiman
was
in
possession
of
damascus
sultan
was
obliged
to
fly
and
in
august
his
brother
djahdjah
returned
to
his
seat
which
he
had
already
once
occupied
he
pays
a
certain
annual
sum
to
the
pasha
and
extorts
double
its
amount
from
the
peasant
the
emir
beshir
has
since
the
reign
of
soleiman
pasha
likewise
acquired
a
certain
influence
over
baalbec
and
is
now
entitled
to
the
yearly
sum
of
fifteen
purses
from
this
district
the
emir
djahdjah
resides
at
baalbec
and
keeps
there
about
metaweli
horsemen
whom
he
equips
and
feeds
out
of
his
own
purse
he
is
well
remembered
by
several
europeans
especially
english
travellers
for
his
rapacity
and
inhospitable
behaviour
the
first
object
which
strikes
the
traveller
arriving
from
the
bekaa
is
a
temple
this
temple
is
not
seen
in
approaching
baalbec
from
damascus
in
the
plain
about
half
an
hour
walk
from
the
town
which
has
received
from
the
natives
the
appellation
of
kubbet
duris
volney
has
not
described
this
temple
it
is
an
octagon
building
supported
by
eight
beautiful
granite
columns
which
are
all
standing
they
are
of
an
order
resembling
the
doric
the
capitals
project
very
little
over
the
shaft
which
has
no
base
over
every
two
pillars
lies
one
large
stone
forming
the
architrave
over
which
the
cornice
is
still
visible
very
little
adorned
with
sculpture
the
roof
has
fallen
in
on
the
side
between
two
of
the
columns
is
an
insulated
niche
of
calcareous
stone
projecting
somewhat
beyond
the
circumference
of
the
octagon
and
rising
to
about
two
feet
below
the
roof
the
granite
of
the
columns
is
particularly
beautiful
the
feldspath
and
quartz
being
mixed
with
the
hornblende
in
large
masses
the
red
feldspath
predominates
one
of
the
columns
is
distinguished
from
the
rest
by
its
green
quartz
we
could
not
find
any
traces
of
inscriptions
september
i
took
lodgings
in
a
small
room
belonging
to
the
catholic
priest
who
superintends
a
parish
of
christian
families
this
being
near
the
great
temple
i
hastened
to
it
in
the
morning
before
any
body
was
apprised
of
my
arrival
the
work
of
wood
who
accompanied
dawkins
to
baalbec
in
and
the
subsequent
account
of
the
place
given
by
volney
who
visited
baalbec
in
render
it
unnecessary
for
me
to
enter
into
any
description
of
these
ruins
i
shall
only
observe
that
volney
is
incorrect
in
describing
the
rock
of
which
the
buildings
are
constructed
as
granite
it
is
of
the
primitive
calcareous
kind
but
harder
than
the
stone
of
tedmor
there
are
however
many
remains
of
granite
columns
in
different
parts
of
the
building
i
observed
no
greek
inscriptions
there
were
some
few
in
latin
and
in
arabic
and
i
copied
the
following
cufic
inscription
on
the
side
of
a
leading
down
into
some
subterranean
chambers
below
the
small
temple
which
the
emir
has
walled
up
to
prevent
a
search
for
hidden
treasures
cufic
inscription
having
seen
a
few
months
before
the
ruins
of
tedmor
a
comparison
between
these
two
renowned
remains
of
antiquity
naturally
offered
itself
to
my
mind
the
entire
view
of
the
ruins
of
palmyra
when
seen
at
a
certain
distance
is
infinitely
more
striking
than
those
of
baalbec
but
there
is
not
any
one
spot
in
the
ruins
of
tedmor
so
imposing
as
the
interior
view
of
the
temple
of
baalbec
the
temple
of
the
sun
at
tedmor
is
upon
a
grander
scale
than
that
of
baalbec
but
it
is
choked
up
with
arab
houses
which
admit
only
of
a
view
of
the
building
in
detail
the
archilecture
of
baalbec
is
richer
than
that
of
tedmor
the
walls
of
the
ancient
city
may
still
be
traced
and
include
a
larger
space
than
the
present
town
ever
occupied
even
in
its
most
flourishing
state
its
circuit
may
be
between
three
and
four
miles
on
the
and
sides
the
gates
of
the
modern
town
formed
in
the
ancient
wall
still
remain
entire
especially
the
northern
gate
it
is
a
narrow
arch
and
comparatively
very
small
i
suppose
it
to
be
of
saracen
origin
the
women
of
baalbec
are
esteemed
the
handsomest
of
the
neighbouring
country
and
many
damascenes
marry
baalbec
girls
the
air
of
belad
baalbec
and
the
bekaa
however
is
far
from
being
healthy
the
chain
of
the
libanus
interrupts
the
course
of
the
westerly
winds
which
are
regular
in
syria
during
the
summer
months
and
the
want
of
these
winds
renders
the
climate
extremely
hot
and
oppressive
september
i
again
visited
the
ruins
this
morning
the
emir
had
been
apprised
of
my
arrival
by
his
secretary
to
whom
i
had
a
letter
of
recommendation
he
sent
the
secretary
to
ask
whether
i
had
any
presents
for
him
i
answered
in
the
negative
but
delivered
to
him
a
letter
which
the
jew
bankers
of
the
pasha
of
damascus
had
given
me
for
him
these
jews
being
men
of
great
influence
he
contented
himself
with
replying
that
as
i
had
no
presents
for
him
it
was
not
necessary
that
i
should
pay
him
my
respects
but
he
left
me
undisturbed
in
my
pursuits
which
was
all
i
wanted
near
a
well
on
the
side
of
the
town
between
the
temple
and
the
mountain
i
found
upon
a
stone
the
following
inscription
cassivs
arrianvs
monvmentvm
sibi
svo
vivvs
fecit
in
the
afternoon
i
made
a
tour
in
the
invirons
of
baalbec
at
the
foot
of
the
a
quarter
of
an
hour
walk
from
the
town
to
the
south
is
a
quarry
where
the
places
are
still
visible
from
whence
several
of
the
large
stones
in
the
south
wall
of
the
castle
were
extracted
one
large
block
is
yet
remaining
cut
on
three
sides
ready
to
be
transported
to
the
building
but
it
must
be
done
by
other
hands
than
those
of
the
metaweli
two
other
blocks
cut
in
like
manner
are
standing
upright
at
a
little
distance
from
each
other
and
near
them
in
the
rock
are
two
small
excavated
tombs
with
three
niches
in
each
for
the
dead
in
a
style
of
workmanship
similar
to
what
i
saw
to
the
north
of
aleppo
in
the
turkman
mountains
towards
deir
samaan
in
the
hills
to
the
of
the
town
just
behind
this
quarry
are
several
tombs
excavated
in
the
rock
like
the
former
but
of
larger
dimensions
in
following
the
quarry
towards
the
village
of
duris
numerous
natural
caverns
are
met
with
in
the
calcareous
rocks
i
entered
more
than
a
dozen
of
them
but
found
no
traces
of
art
except
a
few
seats
or
steps
rudely
cut
out
these
caverns
serve
at
present
as
winter
habitations
for
the
arabs
who
pasture
their
cattle
in
this
district
the
principal
quarry
was
a
full
half
hour
to
the
southward
of
the
town
the
mountains
above
baalbec
are
quite
uncultivated
and
barren
except
at
the
ras
el
ain
or
sources
of
the
river
of
baalbec
where
a
few
trees
only
remain
this
is
a
delightful
place
and
is
famous
amongst
the
inhahitants
of
the
adjoining
districts
for
the
salubrity
of
its
air
and
water
near
the
ain
are
the
ruins
of
a
church
and
mosque
the
ruined
town
of
baalbec
contains
about
seventy
metaweli
families
and
of
catholic
christians
amidst
its
ruins
are
two
handsome
mosques
and
a
fine
bath
the
emir
lives
in
a
spacious
building
called
the
serai
the
inhabitants
fabricate
white
cotton
cloth
like
that
of
zahle
they
have
some
dyeing
houses
and
had
till
within
a
few
years
some
tanneries
the
men
are
the
artizans
here
and
not
the
women
the
property
of
the
people
consists
chiefly
of
cows
of
which
every
house
has
ten
or
fifteen
besides
goats
and
sheep
the
goats
are
of
a
species
not
common
in
other
parts
of
syria
they
have
very
long
ears
large
horns
and
long
hair
but
not
silky
like
that
of
the
goats
of
anatolia
the
breed
of
baalbec
mules
is
much
esteemed
and
i
have
seen
some
of
them
worth
on
the
spot
to
sterling
october
after
having
again
visited
the
ruins
i
engaged
a
man
in
the
forenoon
to
shew
me
the
way
to
the
source
of
the
rivulet
called
djoush
arabic
it
is
in
a
wady
in
the
three
quarters
of
an
hour
distant
from
baalbec
the
rivulet
was
very
small
owing
to
the
remarkable
dryness
of
the
season
and
was
lost
in
the
wady
before
it
reached
the
plain
at
other
times
it
flows
down
to
baalbec
and
joins
the
river
which
after
irrigating
the
gardens
and
fields
round
the
town
loses
itself
in
the
plain
a
little
higher
in
the
mountain
than
the
spot
where
the
water
of
the
djoush
first
issues
from
the
spring
is
a
small
perpendicular
hole
through
which
i
descended
not
without
some
danger
about
sixteen
feet
into
an
aqueduct
which
conveys
the
water
of
the
djoush
underground
for
upwards
of
one
hundred
paces
this
aqueduct
is
six
feet
high
and
three
feet
and
a
half
wide
vaulted
above
and
covered
with
a
thick
coat
of
plaister
it
is
in
perfect
preservation
the
water
in
it
was
about
ten
inches
deep
in
following
up
this
aqueduct
i
came
to
a
vaulted
chamber
about
ten
feet
square
built
with
large
hewn
stones
into
which
the
water
falls
through
another
walled
passage
but
which
i
did
not
enter
being
afraid
that
the
water
falling
on
all
sides
might
extinguish
the
only
candle
that
i
had
with
me
below
this
upper
passage
another
dark
one
is
visible
through
the
water
as
it
falls
down
the
aqueduct
continues
beyond
the
hole
through
which
i
descended
as
far
as
the
spot
where
the
water
issues
from
under
the
earth
above
ground
at
a
small
distance
from
the
spring
and
open
towards
it
is
a
vaulted
room
built
in
the
rock
now
half
filled
with
stones
and
rubbish
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
at
the
time
when
the
plague
visited
deir
el
akhmar
these
countries
and
the
town
of
baalbec
all
the
christian
families
quitted
the
town
and
encamped
for
six
weeks
around
these
springs
from
djoush
we
crossed
the
northern
mountain
of
the
valley
and
came
to
wady
nahle
near
the
village
of
nahle
situated
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
one
hour
and
a
half
from
baalbec
there
is
nothing
remarkable
in
the
village
except
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
building
consisting
at
present
of
the
foundations
only
which
are
strongly
built
it
appeared
to
me
to
be
of
the
same
epoch
as
the
ruins
of
baalbec
the
rivulet
named
nahle
rises
at
one
hour
distance
in
a
narrow
wady
in
the
mountain
the
neighbourhood
of
baalbec
abounds
in
walnut
trees
the
nuts
are
exported
to
zahle
and
the
mountains
at
two
or
two
and
a
half
piastres
per
thousand
in
the
evening
we
left
baalbec
and
began
to
cross
the
plain
in
the
direction
of
the
highest
summit
of
mount
libanus
we
passed
the
village
of
yeid
on
the
left
and
a
little
farther
on
an
encampment
of
turkmans
during
the
winter
the
territory
of
baalbec
is
visited
by
a
tribe
of
turkmans
called
suedie
by
the
hadidein
akeidat
the
arabs
abid
whose
principal
seat
is
near
hamil
between
el
kaa
and
homs
and
the
arabs
harb
the
suedie
turkmans
remain
the
whole
year
in
this
district
and
in
the
valleys
of
the
all
these
tribes
pay
tribute
to
the
emir
of
baalbec
at
the
rate
of
twelve
or
fifteen
pounds
of
butter
for
each
tent
for
the
summer
pasture
at
the
end
of
three
hours
march
we
alighted
at
the
village
deir
el
akhmar
two
hours
after
sunset
this
village
stands
just
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
it
was
at
this
time
deserted
its
inhabitants
having
quitted
it
a
few
weeks
before
to
escape
the
extortions
of
djahdjah
and
retired
to
bshirrai
in
one
of
the
abandoned
houses
we
found
a
shepherd
who
tended
a
flock
belonging
to
the
emir
he
treated
us
with
some
milk
and
made
a
large
fire
round
which
we
lay
down
and
slept
till
mount
libanus
october
the
tobacco
of
deir
el
akhmar
is
the
finest
in
syria
there
is
no
water
in
the
village
but
at
twenty
minutes
from
it
towards
the
plain
is
a
copious
well
after
ascending
the
mountain
for
three
hours
and
a
half
we
reached
the
village
ainnete
thus
far
the
mountain
is
covered
with
low
oak
trees
the
and
common
english
kinds
and
has
but
few
steep
passages
nearly
one
hour
from
ainnete
begins
a
more
level
country
which
divides
the
upper
from
the
lower
libanus
this
part
was
once
well
cultivated
but
the
metaweli
having
driven
the
people
to
despair
the
village
is
in
consequence
deserted
and
in
ruins
a
few
fields
are
still
cultivated
by
the
inhabitants
of
deir
eliaout
and
btedai
who
sow
their
seed
in
the
autumn
and
in
the
spring
return
build
a
few
huts
and
watch
the
growing
crop
the
walnut
tree
abounds
here
there
are
three
springs
at
ainnete
one
of
which
was
dried
up
another
falls
over
the
rock
in
a
pretty
cascade
they
unite
in
a
wady
which
runs
parallel
with
the
upper
mountain
as
far
as
the
lake
liemoun
two
hours
west
of
ainnete
at
this
time
the
lake
was
nearly
dry
an
extraordinary
circumstance
i
saw
its
bed
a
little
higher
up
than
ainnete
from
ainnete
the
ascent
of
the
mountain
is
steep
and
the
vegetation
is
scanty
though
it
reaches
to
the
summit
a
few
oaks
and
shrubs
grow
amongst
the
rocks
the
road
is
practicable
for
loaded
mules
and
my
horse
ascended
without
difficulty
the
honey
of
ainnete
and
of
the
whole
of
libanus
is
of
a
superior
quality
at
the
end
of
two
hours
and
a
half
from
ainnete
we
reached
the
summit
from
whence
i
enjoyed
a
magnificent
view
over
the
bekaa
the
libanus
and
djebel
essheikh
on
one
side
and
the
sea
the
sea
shore
near
tripoli
and
the
deep
valley
of
kadisha
on
the
other
we
were
not
quite
upon
the
highest
summit
which
lay
half
an
hour
to
the
right
baalbec
bore
from
hence
by
e
and
the
summit
of
djebel
essheikh
by
the
whole
of
the
rock
is
calcareous
and
the
surface
towards
the
top
is
so
splintered
by
the
action
of
the
atmosphere
as
to
have
the
appearance
of
layers
of
slates
midway
from
ainnete
i
found
a
small
petrified
shell
and
on
breaking
a
stone
which
i
picked
up
on
the
summit
i
discovered
another
similar
petrifaction
within
it
having
descended
for
two
hours
we
came
to
a
small
cultivated
plain
on
this
side
as
well
as
on
the
other
the
higher
libanus
may
be
distinguished
from
the
lower
the
former
presenting
on
both
sides
a
steep
barren
ascent
of
two
to
two
hours
and
a
half
the
latter
a
more
level
wooded
country
for
the
greater
part
fit
for
cultivation
this
difference
of
surface
is
observable
throughout
the
libanus
from
the
point
where
i
crossed
it
for
eight
hours
in
a
direction
the
descent
terminates
in
one
of
the
numerous
deep
valleys
which
run
towards
the
seashore
i
left
my
guide
on
the
small
plain
and
proceeded
to
the
right
towards
the
cedars
which
are
visible
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
standing
half
an
hour
from
the
direct
line
of
the
route
to
bshirrai
at
the
foot
of
the
steep
declivities
of
the
higher
division
of
the
mountain
they
stand
on
uneven
ground
and
form
a
small
wood
of
the
oldest
and
best
looking
trees
i
counted
eleven
or
twelve
very
large
ones
about
fifty
of
middling
size
and
more
than
three
hundred
smaller
and
young
ones
the
oldest
trees
are
distinguished
by
having
the
foliage
and
small
branches
at
the
bshirrai
top
only
and
by
four
five
or
even
seven
trunks
springing
from
one
base
the
branches
and
foliage
of
the
others
were
lower
but
i
saw
none
whose
leaves
touched
the
ground
like
those
in
kew
gardens
the
trunks
of
the
old
trees
are
covered
with
the
names
of
travellers
and
other
persons
who
have
visited
them
i
saw
a
date
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
trunks
of
the
oldest
trees
seem
to
be
quite
dead
the
wood
is
of
a
gray
tint
i
took
off
a
piece
of
one
of
them
but
it
was
afterwards
stolen
together
with
several
specimens
of
minerals
which
i
sent
from
zahle
to
damascus
at
an
hour
and
a
quarter
from
the
cedars
and
considerably
below
them
on
the
edge
of
a
rocky
descent
lies
the
village
of
bshirrai
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
kadisha
arabic
october
bshirrai
consists
of
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
houses
its
inhabitants
are
all
maronites
and
have
seven
churches
at
half
an
hour
from
the
village
is
the
carmelite
convent
of
deir
serkis
sergius
inhabited
at
present
by
a
single
monk
a
very
worthy
old
man
a
native
of
tuscany
who
has
been
a
missionary
to
egypt
india
and
persia
nothing
can
be
more
striking
than
a
comparison
of
the
fertile
but
uncultivated
districts
of
bekaa
and
baalbec
with
the
rocky
mountains
in
the
opposite
direction
where
notwithstanding
that
nature
seems
to
afford
nothing
for
the
sustenance
of
the
inhabitants
numerous
villages
flourish
and
every
inch
of
ground
is
cultivated
bshirrai
is
surrounded
with
fruit
trees
mulberry
plantations
vineyards
fields
of
dhourra
and
other
corn
though
there
is
scarcely
a
natural
plain
twenty
feet
square
the
inhabitants
with
great
industry
build
terraces
to
level
the
ground
and
prevent
the
earth
from
being
swept
down
by
the
winter
rains
and
at
the
same
time
to
retain
the
water
requisite
for
the
irrigation
of
their
crops
water
is
very
abundant
as
streams
from
numerous
springs
descend
kanobin
on
every
side
into
the
kadisha
whose
source
is
two
hours
distant
from
bshirrai
in
the
direction
of
the
mountain
from
whence
i
came
bshirrai
belongs
to
the
district
of
tripoli
but
is
at
present
with
the
whole
of
the
mountains
in
the
hands
of
the
emir
beshir
or
chief
of
the
druses
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
rear
the
have
excellent
plantations
of
tobacco
and
a
few
manufactories
of
cotton
stuffs
used
by
the
mountaineers
as
shawls
for
girdles
forty
years
ago
the
village
was
in
the
hands
of
the
metaweli
who
were
driven
out
by
the
maronites
in
the
morning
i
went
to
kanobin
after
walking
for
two
hours
and
a
half
over
the
upper
plain
i
descended
the
precipitous
side
of
a
collateral
branch
of
the
valley
kadisha
and
continued
my
way
to
the
convent
which
i
reached
in
two
hours
and
a
half
it
is
built
on
a
steep
precipice
on
the
right
of
the
valley
at
half
an
hour
walk
from
the
river
and
appears
as
if
suspended
in
the
air
being
supported
by
a
high
wall
built
against
the
side
of
the
mountain
there
is
a
spring
close
to
it
the
church
which
is
excavated
in
the
rock
and
dedicated
to
the
virgin
is
decorated
with
the
portraits
of
a
great
number
of
patriarchs
during
the
winter
the
peasants
suspend
their
in
bags
to
the
portrait
of
some
favourite
saint
and
implore
his
influence
for
a
plenteous
harvest
of
silk
from
this
custom
the
convent
derives
a
considerable
income
kanobin
is
the
seat
of
the
patriarch
of
the
maronites
who
is
at
the
head
of
twelve
maronite
bishops
and
here
in
former
times
he
generally
passed
the
summer
months
retiring
in
the
winter
to
mar
hanna
but
the
vexations
and
insults
which
the
patriarchs
were
exposed
to
from
the
metaweli
in
their
excursions
to
and
from
baalbec
induced
them
for
many
years
to
abandon
this
residence
the
present
patriarch
is
the
first
who
for
a
long
time
has
resided
in
hosrun
kanobin
though
i
had
no
letter
of
introduction
to
him
and
was
in
the
dress
of
a
peasant
he
invited
me
to
dinner
and
i
met
at
his
table
his
secretary
bishop
stefano
who
has
been
educated
at
rome
and
has
some
notions
of
europe
while
i
was
there
a
rude
peasant
was
ordained
a
priest
kanobin
had
once
a
considerable
library
but
it
has
been
gradually
dispersed
and
not
a
vestige
of
it
now
remains
the
cells
of
the
monks
are
for
the
most
part
in
ruins
three
hours
distant
from
kanobin
at
the
convent
kashheya
which
is
near
the
village
ehden
is
a
printing
office
where
in
the
syriac
language
are
printed
this
language
is
known
and
spoken
by
many
maronites
and
in
this
district
the
greater
part
of
them
write
arabic
in
the
syriac
characters
the
names
of
the
owners
of
the
were
all
written
in
this
character
in
different
hands
upon
the
bags
suspended
in
the
church
i
returned
to
bshirrai
by
an
easier
road
than
that
which
i
had
travelled
in
the
morning
at
the
end
of
three
quarters
of
an
hour
i
regained
the
upper
plain
from
whence
i
proceeded
for
two
hours
by
a
gentle
ascent
through
fields
and
orchards
up
to
the
village
the
potatoe
succeeds
here
very
well
a
crop
was
growing
in
the
garden
of
the
carmelite
convent
it
has
also
been
cultivated
for
some
time
past
in
kesrouan
in
the
mountains
about
kanobin
tigers
are
said
to
be
frequently
met
with
i
suppose
ounces
are
meant
october
i
departed
from
bshirrai
with
the
intention
of
returning
to
zahle
over
the
higher
range
of
the
libanus
we
crossed
the
kadisha
at
a
short
distance
from
bishirrai
above
the
place
where
it
falls
over
the
precipice
at
one
hour
distant
from
bshirrai
and
opposite
to
it
we
passed
the
village
of
hosrun
the
same
cultivation
prevails
here
as
in
the
vicinity
of
bshirrai
mulberry
and
ard
laklouk
walnut
trees
and
vines
are
the
chief
productions
from
hosrun
we
continued
our
way
along
the
foot
of
the
highest
barren
part
of
libanus
about
two
hours
from
its
summit
the
mountain
affords
pasturage
and
is
capable
of
cultivation
from
the
numerous
springs
which
are
everywhere
met
with
during
the
greater
part
of
this
day
journey
i
had
a
fine
view
of
the
sea
shore
between
tartous
and
tripoli
and
from
thence
downwards
towards
jebail
at
three
hours
and
a
half
from
hosrun
still
following
the
foot
of
the
upper
chain
of
the
libanus
we
entered
the
district
of
tanurin
ard
tanurin
so
called
from
a
village
situated
below
in
a
valley
the
spots
in
the
mountain
proper
for
cultivation
are
sown
by
the
inhabitants
of
tanurin
such
as
afford
pasture
only
are
visited
by
the
arabs
el
haib
i
was
astonished
at
seeing
so
high
in
the
mountain
numerous
camels
and
arab
huts
these
arabs
pass
the
winter
months
on
the
sea
shore
about
tripoli
jebail
and
tartous
though
like
the
bedouins
they
have
no
fixed
habitations
their
features
are
not
of
the
true
bedouin
cast
and
their
dialect
though
different
from
that
of
the
peasants
is
not
a
pure
bedouin
dialect
they
are
tributary
to
the
turkish
governors
and
at
peace
with
all
the
country
people
but
they
have
the
character
of
having
a
great
propensity
to
thieving
their
property
besides
camels
consists
in
horses
cows
sheep
and
goats
their
chief
is
khuder
el
aissy
arabic
on
leaving
the
district
of
tanurin
i
entered
ard
laklouk
arabic
which
i
can
not
describe
better
than
by
comparing
it
to
one
of
the
pasturages
in
the
alps
it
is
covered
with
grass
and
its
numerous
springs
together
with
the
heavy
dews
which
fall
during
the
summer
months
have
produced
a
verdure
of
a
deeper
tint
than
any
i
saw
in
the
other
parts
of
syria
which
i
visited
the
arabs
el
haib
come
up
hither
also
and
wander
about
the
district
for
five
months
in
the
year
some
of
them
even
remain
here
the
whole
akoura
year
except
that
in
winter
they
descend
from
the
pastures
and
pitch
their
tents
round
the
villages
of
tanurin
and
akoura
which
are
situated
in
a
valley
sheltered
on
every
side
by
the
perpendicular
sides
of
the
upper
libanus
at
tanurin
and
laklouk
the
winter
corn
was
already
above
ground
the
people
water
the
fields
for
three
or
four
days
before
they
sow
the
seed
akoura
has
a
bad
name
amongst
the
people
of
this
country
its
inhabitants
who
are
all
greek
catholics
are
accused
of
avarice
and
inhospitality
the
mountaineers
when
upon
a
journey
never
think
of
spending
a
para
for
their
eating
drinking
or
lodging
on
arriving
in
the
evening
at
a
village
they
alight
at
the
house
of
some
acquaintance
if
they
have
any
which
is
generally
the
case
and
say
to
the
owner
i
am
your
guest
djay
deyfak
arabic
the
host
gives
the
traveller
a
supper
consisting
of
milk
bread
and
borgul
and
if
rich
and
liberal
feeds
his
mule
or
mare
also
when
the
traveller
has
no
acquaintance
in
the
village
he
alights
at
any
house
he
pleases
ties
up
his
beast
and
smokes
his
pipe
till
he
receives
a
welcome
from
the
master
of
the
house
who
makes
it
a
point
of
honour
to
receive
him
as
a
friend
and
to
give
him
a
supper
in
the
morning
he
departs
with
a
simple
good
bye
such
is
the
general
custom
in
these
parts
the
inhabitants
of
akoura
however
are
noted
for
refusing
to
receive
travellers
to
whom
they
will
neither
give
a
supper
nor
sell
them
provision
for
ready
money
the
consequence
of
which
conduct
is
that
the
akourans
when
travelling
about
are
obliged
to
conceal
their
origin
in
order
to
obtain
food
on
the
road
my
guide
had
a
friend
at
akoura
but
he
happened
to
be
absent
we
therefore
alighted
at
another
house
where
we
obtained
with
much
difficulty
a
little
barley
for
our
horses
and
we
should
have
gone
supperless
to
rest
had
i
not
repaired
to
the
sheikh
and
made
him
believe
i
was
a
kourdine
my
dress
being
somewhat
like
that
of
the
kourds
in
the
service
of
the
pasha
of
damascus
on
my
way
to
the
emir
beshir
as
i
spoke
with
confidence
the
sheikh
became
alarmed
and
sent
us
a
few
loaves
of
bread
and
some
cheese
on
my
return
i
found
my
guide
in
the
midst
of
a
large
assembly
of
people
abusing
them
for
their
meanness
the
property
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
village
consists
of
cows
and
other
cattle
silkworms
and
plantations
of
olive
trees
at

terminates
and
farther
down
towards

and
the
bekaa
the
mountain
is
called
djebel
sannin
arabic
the
libanus
is
here
more
barren
and
wild
than
further
to
the
north
the
rocks
are
all
in
perfectly
horizontal
layers
some
of
which
are
thirty
to
forty
yards
in
thickness
while
others
are
only
a
few
yards
october
we
left
the
inhospitable
akoura
before
day
light
and
reached
after
one
hour
and
three
quarters
a
village
called
afka
situated
in
the
bottom
of
a
valley
near
a
spring
whose
waters
join
those
of
wady
akoura
and
flow
down
towards
jebail
the
name
afka
is
found
in
the
ancient
geography
of
syria
at
aphaca
according
to
zosimus
was
a
temple
of
venus
where
the
handsomest
girls
of
syria
sacrificed
to
the
goddess
it
was
situated
near
a
small
lake
between
heliopolis
and
the
sea
coast
zosim
the
lake
liemoun
is
at
three
hours
distance
from
afka
i
could
not
hear
of
any

near
afka
all
the
inhabitants
are
metaweli

near
it
towards

villages
of
mghaiere
meneitere

laese
from

the
road
leads
up
a
steep
wady
at
half
an
hour
from
it
is
the
spring
called

three
quarters
of

this
district
is
called
watty
el
bordj
watty
el
bordj
arabic
from
a
small
ruined
tower
it
is
three
or
four
hours
in
length
and
two
in
breadth
in
the
spring
the
arabs
abid
turkmans
and
kourdines
here
pasture
their
cattle
these
kourdines
bring
annually
into
syria
from
twenty
to
thirty
thousand
sheep
from
the
mountains
of
kourdistan
the
greater
part
of
which
are
consumed
by
aleppo
damascus
and
the
mountains
as
syria
does
not
produce
a
sufficient
number
for
its
inhabitants
the
kourd
sheep
are
larger
than
those
of
syria
but
their
flesh
is
less
esteemed
the
kourd
first
visit
with
their
flocks
aleppo
then
hama
homs
and
baalbec
and
what
they
do
not
sell
on
the
road
they
bring
to
pasture
at
watty
el
bordj
whither
the
people
of
zahle
deir
el
kammar
and
other
towns
in
the
mountains
repair
and
buy
up
thousands
of
them
which
they
afterwards
sell
in
retail
to
the
peasants
of
the
mountains
they
buy
them
for
ready
money
at
twenty
to
thirty
piastres
a
head
and
sell
them
two
months
afterwards
at
thirty
to
forty
the
mountaineers
of
the
druse
and
maronite
districts
breed
very
few
sheep
and
very
seldom
eat
animal
food
on
the
approach
of
their
respective
great
festivals
christmas
with
the
maronites
and
ramadan
with
the
druses
each
head
of
a
family
kills
one
or
two
sheep
during
the
rest
of
the
year
he
feeds
his
people
on
borgul
with
occasionally
some
old
cow
or
goat
flesh
it
is
only
in
the
largest
of
the
mountain
towns
of
the
druses
and
maronites
that
flesh
is
brought
daily
to
market
there
are
no
springs
or
water
in
the
watty
el
bordj
but
the
melting
of
the
snow
in
the
spring
affords
drink
for
men
and
cattle
and
snow
water
is
often
found
during
the
greater
part
of
the
summer
in
some
shaped
holes
formed
in
the
ground
by
the
snow
at
the
time
i
passed
no
water
was
any
where
to
be
found
in
many
places
the
snow
remains
throughout
the
year
but
this
year
none
was
left
not
even
on
the
summits
of
the
mountain
except
in
a
few
spots
on
the
northern
declivity
of
the
libanus
towards
the
district
of
akkar
watty
el
bordj
affords
excellent
pasturage
in
many
spots
it
is
overgrown
with
trees
mostly
oaks
and
the
barbery
is
also
very
frequent
we
started
partridges
at
every
step
our
route
lay
generally
by
four
hours
from
ain
bahr
we
entered
the
mountain
a
part
of
which
is
considered
to
belong
to
kesrouan
it
is
completely
stony
and
rocky
and
i
found
some
calcareous
spath
i
shall
here
remark
that
the
whole
of
the
mountain
from
zahle
to
belad
akkar
is
by
the
country
people
comprehended
under
the
general
name
of
djurd
baalbec
djurd
meaning
in
the
northern
arabic
dialect
a
rocky
mountain
crossing
this
part
of
the
mountain
sannin
for
two
hours
we
came
to
a
spring
called
ain
naena
from
whence
another
road
leads
down
eastwards
into
the
territory
of
baalbec
this
route
is
much
frequented
by
the
people
of
kesrouan
who
bring
this
way
the
iron
ore
of
shouair
to
the
mesbek
or
smelting
furnaces
at
nebae
el
mauradj
two
hours
from
hence
to
the
shouair
which
is
at
least
ten
hours
distance
affording
no
fuel
for
smelting
the
iron
ore
is
carried
upon
mules
and
asses
one
day
journey
and
a
half
to
the
mesbek
where
the
mountain
abounds
in
oak
from
aine
naena
we
gradually
descended
and
in
three
hours
reached
zahle
october
at
zahle
i
found
the
catholic
bishop
who
was
absent
on
his
episcopal
tour
during
my
first
visit
to
this
place
he
is
distinguished
from
his
countrymen
by
the
politeness
of
his
manners
the
liberality
of
his
sentiments
his
general
information
and
his
desire
of
knowledge
though
at
a
very
advanced
age
i
had
letters
for
him
and
he
recommended
himself
particularly
to
me
by
being
the
friend
of
browne
the
african
traveller
who
had
lived
with
him
a
fortnight
and
had
visited
zahle
baalbec
in
his
company
his
diocese
comprises
the
whole
christian
community
in
the
bekaa
and
the
adjoining
villages
of
the
mountain
he
is
with
five
other
bishops
under
the
orders
of
the
patriarch
at
mekhalis
and
there
are
besides
seven
monasteries
under
this
diocese
in
syria
the
bishop
revenue
arises
from
a
yearly
personal
tax
of
half
a
piastre
upon
all
the
male
adults
in
his
diocese
he
lives
in
a
truly
patriarchal
manner
dressing
in
a
simple
black
gown
and
black
abbaye
and
carries
in
his
hand
a
long
oaken
stick
as
an
episcopal
staff
he
is
adored
by
his
parishioners
though
they
reproach
him
with
a
want
of
fervour
in
his
intercourse
with
other
christian
sects
by
which
they
mean
fanatism
which
is
a
striking
feature
in
the
character
of
the
christians
not
only
of
the
mountain
but
also
of
the
principal
syrian
towns
and
of
the
open
country
this
bigotry
is
not
directed
so
much
against
the
mohammedans
as
against
their
christian
brethren
whose
creed
at
all
differs
from
their
own
it
need
hardly
be
mentioned
here
that
many
of
those
sects
which
tore
europe
to
pieces
in
the
earlier
ages
of
christianity
still
exist
in
these
countries
greeks
catholics
maronites
syriacs
chaldeans
and
jacobites
all
have
their
respective
parishes
and
churches
unable
to
effect
any
thing
against
the
religion
of
their
haughty
rulers
the
turks
they
turn
the
only
weapons
they
possess
scandal
and
intrigue
with
fury
against
each
other
and
each
sect
is
mad
enough
to
believe
that
its
church
would
flourish
on
the
ruins
of
those
of
their
heretic
brethren
the
principal
hatred
subsists
between
the
catholics
and
the
greeks
of
the
latter
many
thousands
have
been
converted
to
catholicism
so
that
in
the
northern
parts
of
syria
all
catholics
the
maronites
excepted
were
formerly
of
the
greek
church
this
is
the
case
in
aleppo
damascus
and
in
all
the
intermediate
country
communities
of
original
latin
christians
being
found
only
around
jerusalem
and
nablous
the
greeks
heusn
nieha
of
course
see
with
indignation
the
proselytism
of
their
brethren
which
is
daily
gaining
ground
and
avenge
themselves
upon
the
apostates
with
the
most
furious
hatred
nor
are
the
greek
and
original
latin
christians
backward
in
cherishing
similar
feelings
and
scenes
most
disgraceful
to
christianity
are
frequently
the
consequence
in
those
parts
where
no
greeks
live
as
in
the
mountains
of
libanus
the
different
sects
of
catholics
turn
their
hatred
against
each
other
and
the
maronites
fight
with
the
converted
greek
catholics
or
the
latins
as
they
do
at
aleppo
with
the
followers
of
the
greek
church
this
system
of
intolerance
at
which
the
turkish
governors
smile
because
they
are
constantly
gainers
by
it
is
carried
so
far
that
in
many
places
the
passing
catholic
is
obliged
to
practise
the
greek
rites
in
order
to
escape
the
effects
of
the
fanatism
of
the
inhabitants
on
my
way
from
zahle
to
banias
we
stopped
one
night
at
hasbeya
and
another
at
rasheya
el
fukhar
at
both
of
which
places
my
guide
went
to
the
greek
church
and
prayed
according
to
its
forms
in
passing
through
zahle
as
he
informed
me
the
greeks
found
it
equally
necessary
to
conform
with
the
rites
of
the
latin
catholics
the
intrigues
carried
on
at
jerusalem
between
the
greek
and
latin
monks
contribute
to
increase
these
diputes
which
would
have
long
ago
led
to
a
christian
civil
war
in
these
countries
did
not
the
iron
rod
of
the
turkish
government
repress
their
religious
fury
the
vineyards
are
estimated
at
the
exact
number
of
vines
they
contain
and
each
vine
if
of
good
quality
is
worth
one
piastre
the
miri
or
land
tax
of
every
hundred
arabic
vines
is
ten
paras
for
many
years
past
a
double
miri
has
been
levied
upon
zahle
october
remained
at
zahle
and
enjoyed
the
instructive
conversation
of
the
bishop
basilios
october
i
went
to
see
the
ruined
temple
called
heusn
nieha
two
hours
from
zahle
in
the
djebel
sannin
and
half
an
hour
from
the
village
of
fursul
these
remains
stand
in
a
wady
surrounded
by
barren
rocks
having
a
spring
near
them
to
the
eastward
the
temple
faced
the
west
a
grand
flight
of
steps
twelve
paces
broad
with
a
column
three
feet
and
a
half
in
diameter
at
each
end
of
the
lower
step
formed
the
approach
to
a
spacious
pronaos
in
which
are
remains
of
columns
here
a
door
six
paces
in
width
opens
into
the
cella
the
fallen
roof
of
which
now
covers
the
floor
and
the
side
walls
to
half
their
original
height
only
remain
this
chamber
is
paces
in
length
by
fifteen
in
breadth
on
each
of
the
side
walls
stood
six
pilasters
of
a
bad
ionic
order
at
the
extremity
of
the
chamber
are
steps
leading
to
a
platform
where
the
statue
of
the
deity
may
perhaps
have
stood
the
whole
space
is
here
filled
up
with
fragments
of
columns
and
walls
the
square
stones
used
in
the
construction
of
the
walls
are
in
general
about
four
or
five
cubic
feet
each
but
i
saw
some
twelve
feet
long
four
feet
high
and
four
feet
in
breadth
on
the
right
side
of
the
entrance
door
is
a
staircase
in
the
wall
leading
to
the
top
of
the
building
and
much
resembling
in
its
mode
of
construction
the
staircase
in
the
principal
temple
of
baalbec
the
remains
of
the
capitals
of
columns
betray
a
very
corrupt
taste
being
badly
sculptured
and
without
any
elegance
either
in
design
or
execution
and
the
temple
seems
to
have
been
built
in
the
latest
times
of
paganism
and
was
perhaps
subsequently
repaired
and
converted
into
a
church
the
stone
with
which
it
has
been
built
is
more
decayed
than
that
in
the
ruins
at
baalbec
being
here
more
exposed
to
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
no
inscriptions
were
any
where
visible
around
the
temple
are
some
ruins
of
ancient
and
others
of
more
modern
habitations
above
fursul
is
a
plain
called

the
neighbourhood
of
hasbeya
is
interesting
to
the
mineralogist
i
was
told
by
the
priest
that
a
metal
was
found
near
it
of
which
nobody
knew
the
name
nor
made
any
use
having
procured
a
labourer
i
found
after
digging
in
the
wady
a
few
hundred
paces
to
the
of
the
village
several
small
pieces
of
a
metallic
substance
which
i
took
to
be
a
native
amalgam
of
mercury
according
to
the
description
given
me
cinnabar
is
also
found
here
but
we
could
discover
no
specimen
of
it
after
half
an
hour
digging
the
ground
all
around
and
the
spring
near
the
village
are
souk
el
kahn
strongly
impregnated
with
iron
the
rock
is
sandstone
of
a
dark
red
colour
the
other
mineral
curiosities
are
a
number
of
wells
of
bitumen
judaicum
in
the
wady
at
one
hour
below
the
village
on
the
west
side
after
recrossing
the
bridge
they
are
situated
upon
the
declivity
of
a
chalky
hill
the
bitumen
is
found
in
large
veins
at
about
twenty
feet
below
the
surface
the
pits
are
from
six
to
twelve
feet
in
diameter
the
workmen
descend
by
a
rope
and
wheel
and
in
hewing
out
the
bitumen
they
leave
columns
of
that
substance
at
different
intervals
as
a
support
to
the
earth
above
pieces
of
several
rotolas
in
weight
each
the
rotola
is
about
five
pounds
are
brought
up
there
are
upwards
of
of
these
pits
or
wells
but
the
greater
part
of
them
are
abandoned
and
overgrown
with
shrubs
i
saw
only
one
that
appeared
to
have
been
recently
worked
they
work
only
during
the
summer
months
the
bitumen
is
called
hommar
and
the
wells
biar
el
hommar
arabic
the
emir
possesses
the
monopoly
of
the
bitumen
he
alone
works
the
pits
and
sells
the
produce
to
the
merchants
of
damascus
beirout
and
aleppo
it
was
now
at
paras
the
rotola
or
about
the
pound
i
left
hasbeya
on
the
same
day
and
continued
to
descend
the
valley
on
the
side
of
the
river
half
an
hour
from
the
bridge
i
arrived
at
souk
el
khan
in
the
hills
to
the
right
is
the
village
kankabe
souk
el
khan
is
a
large
ruined
khan
where
the
inhabitants
to
the
distance
of
one
day
journey
round
assemble
every
tuesday
to
hold
a
market
in
the
summer
they
exhibit
their
merchandize
in
the
open
air
but
in
the
winter
they
make
use
of
some
large
rooms
still
remaining
within
the
khan
the
road
to
banias
leads
along
the
valley
parallel
with
the
course
of
the
river
but
as
i
had
heard
of
some
ruins
in
the
mountain
at
a
village
called
hereibe
to
the
east
of
the
route
i
turned
in
that
direction
and
reached
the
hereibe
village
in
two
hours
after
quitting
hasbeya
between
souk
el
khan
and
hereibe
lies
the
village
ferdous
hereibe
is
considerably
higher
than
the
river
all
this
neighbourhood
is
planted
with
and
olives
from
hence
to
damascus
are
the
most
common
food
of
the
inhabitants
who
put
them
into
salt
but
they
do
not
thereby
entirely
remove
the
bitter
taste
at
aleppo
and
damascus
olives
destined
for
the
table
are
immersed
for
a
fortnight
in
water
in
which
are
dissolved
one
proportion
of
chalk
and
two
proportions
of
alkali
this
takes
away
all
bitterness
but
the
fruit
is
at
the
same
time
deprived
of
a
part
of
its
flavour
on
the
west
side
of
the
village
of
hereibe
stands
a
ruined
temple
quite
insulated
it
is
twenty
paces
in
length
and
thirteen
in
breadth
the
entrance
is
towards
the
west
and
it
had
a
vestibule
in
front
with
two
columns
on
each
side
of
the
entrance
are
two
niches
one
above
the
other
the
upper
one
has
small
pilasters
the
lower
one
is
ornamented
on
the
top
by
a
shell
like
the
niches
in
the
temple
at
baalbec
the
way
which
has
no
decoration
whatever
opens
into
a
room
ten
paces
square
in
which
no
columns
sculpture
or
ornaments
of
any
kind
are
visible
three
of
the
walls
only
are

in
one
corner
of
which
is
a

leading
to
the
top
of
the
building
in
this
smaller

are
four
pilasters
in
the
four
angles
under
the
large
room
are
two
spacious
vaults
on
the
outside
of
the
temple
at
the
east
corners
are
badly
wrought
pilasters
of
the
ionic
order
the
roof
has
fallen
in
and
fills
up
the
interior
the
stone
employed
is
of
the

quality
as
that
used
at
heusn
nieha
and
baalbec
from
hereibe
i
came
to
the

ain
ferkhan
in
one
hour
and
from
thence
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
to
the
village
banias
over
mountainous
ground
the
village
stands
on
a
mountain
which
commands
a
beautiful
view
of
the
lake
houle
its
plain
and
the
interjacent
country
it
contains
about
one
hundred
houses
of
which
are
inhabited
by
turks
and
the
remainder
by
greeks
the
inhabitants
live
by
the
manufacture
of
earthen
pots
which
they
sell
to
the
distance
of
four
or
five
days
journey
around
especially
in
the
haouran
and
djolan
they
mould
them
in
very
elegant
shapes
and
paint
them
with
a
almost
every
house
has
its
pottery
and
the

are
baked

october
we
set
out
in
a
rainy
morning
from
i
was
told
that
in
the
mountain
to
the
one
hour
and
a
half
were
considerable
ruins
the
mountains
of
hasbeya
or
the
chain
of

divide
at
five
hours
from
the

into
two
branches
the
western
a
little
farther
to

takes
the

joins
the

its
continuations
towards

and
the
ard

the
latter
from
three
to
four
hours
in
breadth
we
descended
from
into
the
plain
in
which
we
continued
till
we
reached
banias
at
the
end
of
four
hours
thoroughly
drenched
by
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
we
alighted
at
the
menzel
or
medhaafe
this
is
a
sort
of
khan
found
in
almost
every
village
through
which
there
is
a
frequented
route
strangers
sleep
in
the
medhaafe
and
the
sheikh
of
the
village
generally
sends
them
their
dinner
or
supper
for
this
he
does
not
accept
of
any
present
at
least
not
of
such
as
common
travellers
can
offer
but
it
is
custmary
to
give
something
to
the
servant
or

who
brings
the
meal
and
takes
care
that
castle
of

my
money
being
almost
expended
i
had
no
time
to
lose
in
gratifying
my
curiosity
in
the
invirons
of
banias
immediately
after
my
arrival
i
took
a
man
of
the
village
to
shew
me
the
way
to
the
ruined
castle
of
banias
which
bears
by
from
it
it
stands
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
which
forms
part
of
the
mountain
of
heish
at
an
hour
and
a
quarter
from
banias
it
is
now
in
complete
ruins
but
was
once
a
very
strong
fortress
its
whole
circumference
is
minutes
it
is
surrounded
by
a
wall
ten
feet
thick
flanked
with
numerous
round
towers
built
with
equal
blocks
of
stone
each
about
two
feet
square
the
keep
or
citadel
seems
to
have
been
on
the
highest
summit
on
the
eastern
side
where
the
walls
are
stronger
than
on
the
lower
or
western
side
the
view
from
hence
over
the
houle
and
a
part
of
its
lake
the
djebel
safad
and
the
barren
heish
is
magnificent
on
the
western
side
within
the
precincts
of
the
castle
are
ruins
of
many
private
habitations
at
both
the
western
corners
runs
a
succession
of
dark
strongly
built
low
apartments
like
cells
vaulted
and
with
small
narrow
loop
holes
as
if
for
musquetry
on
this
side
also
is
a
well
more
than
twenty
feet
square
walled
in
with
a
vaulted
roof
at
least
feet
high
the
well
was
even
in
this
dry
season
full
of
water
there
are
three
others
in
the
castle
there
are
many
apartments
and
recesses
in
the
castle
which
could
only
be
exactly
described
by
a
plan
of
the
whole
building
it
seems
to
have
been
erected
during
the
period
of
the
crusades
and
must
certainly
have
been
a
very
strong
hold
to
those
who
possessed
it
i
saw
no
inscriptions
though
i
was
afterwards
told
that
there
are
several
both
in
arabic
and
in
frank
greek
or
latin
the
castle
has
but
one
gate
on
the
south
side

could
discover
no
traces

is
the

of
the
river
of

which
empties
itself
into
the
jordan
at
the
distance
of
an
hour
and
a
half
in
the
plain
below
over
the
source
is
a
perpendicular
rock
in
which
several
niches
have
been
cut
to
receive
statues
the
largest
niche
is
above
a
spacious
cavern
under
which
the
river
rises
this
niche
is
six
feet
broad
and
as
much
in
depth
and
has
a
smaller
niche
in
the
bottom
of
it
immediately
above
it
in
the
perpendicular
face
of
the
rock
is
another
niche
adorned
with
pilasters
supporting
a
shell

like
that
of

there
are
two
other
niches
near
these
and
twenty
paces
farther
two
more
nearly
buried
in
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
each
of
these
niches
had
an
inscription
annexed
to
it
but
i
could
not
decipher
any
thing
except
the
following
characters

are
nearly
covered

also
that

some
remains

the
principal

to
have
been
on

also
an

small
dimensions
in

october
it
being
ramazan
we
remained
under
a
large
tree
before
the
menzel
smoking
and
conversing
till
very
late
the
researches
which
seetzen
made
here
four
years
ago
were
the
principal
topic
he
continued
his
tour
from
hence
towards
the
lake
of
tabaria
and
the
eastern
borders
of
the
dead
sea
the
christians
believe
that
he
was
sent
by
the
yellow
king
melek

a
title
which
they
give
the
emperor
of
russia
to
examine
the
country
preparatory
to
an
invasion
to
deliver
it
from
the
turkish
yoke
the
turks
on
the
contrary
believe
that
like
all
strangers
who
enquire
after
inscriptions
he
was
in
search
of
treasure
when
questioned
on
this
subject
at
baalbec
i
answered
the
treasures
of
this
country
are
not
beneath
the
earth
they
come
from
god
and
are
on
the
surface
of
the

work
your
fields
and
sow
them
and
you
will
find
the
greatest
treasure
in
an
abundant
harvest
by
your
life
a
common
oath
truth
comes
from
your
lips
arabic
is
a
common
word
used
in

for
arabic
which
signifies
thy
mouth
arabic
wuhiyatak
el
hak
fi
tummak
was
the
reply
on
the
south
side
of
the
village
are
the
ruins
of
a
strong
castle
which
from
its
appearance
and
mode
of
construction
may
be
conjectured
to
be
of
the
same
age
as
the
castle
upon
the
mountain
it
is
surrounded
by
a
broad
ditch
and
had
a
wall
within
the
ditch
several
of
its
towers
are
still
standing
a
very
solid
bridge
which
crosses
the
winter
torrent
wady
el
kyd
leads
to
the
entrance
of
the
castle
over
which
is
an
arabic
inscription
but
for
want
of
a
ladder
i
could
make
out
nothing
of
it
but
the
date
and
years
arabic
taking
the
era
of
the
hedjra
bostra
it
coincides
with
the
epoch
of
the
crusades
there
are
five
or
six
granite
columns
built
into
the
walls
of
the
gateway
i
went
to
see
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
city
of
bostra
of
which
the
people
spoke
much
adding
that
mousa
the
name
assumed
by
seetzen
had
offered
thirty
piastres
to
any
one
who
would
accompany
him
to
the
place
but
that
nobody
had
ventured
through
fear
of
the
arabs
i
found
a
good
natured
fellow
who
for
three
piastres
undertook
to
lead
me
to
the
spot
bostra
must
not
be
confounded
with
boszra
in
the
haouran
both
places
are
mentioned
in
the
books
of
moses
the
way
to
the
ruins
lies
for
an
hour
and
a
half
in
the
road
by
which
i
came
from
it
then
ascends
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
a
steep
mountain
to
the
right
on
the
top
of
which
is
the
city
it
is
divided
into
two
parts
the
largest
being
upon
the
very
summit
the
smaller
at
ten
minutes
walk
lower
down
and
resembling
a
suburb
to
the
upper
part
traces
are
still
visible
of
a
paved
way
that
had
connected
the
two
divisions
there
is
scarcely
any
thing
in
the
ruins
worth
notice
they
consist
of
the
foundations
of
private
habitations

found
in
going
up
a
species
of

with
six
very
long
legs

a
slender

about
four
inches

told

that

is
at

and
a
quarter
from

it
is
in
the
plain
near
a
hill
called
there
are
two
springs
near
each
other
one
smaller
than
the
other
whose
waters
unite
immediately
below
both
sources
are
on
level

amongst
rocks
of

the

immediately
forms
a
river
twelve
or
fifteen
yards
across
which
rushes
rapidly
over
a
stony
bed
into
the
lower
plain
there
are
no
ruins
of
any
kind
near
the
springs
but
the
hill
over
them
seems
to
have
been
built
upon
though
nothing
now
is
visible
at
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
the
of
the
spring
are
ruins
of
ancient
habitations
built
of
the
black

the
principal
rock
found
in
the
plain
the
few
houses
at
present
inhabited
on
that
spot
are
called
enkeil
banias
i
was
told
that
the
ancient
name
of
the
river
of
banias
was
djour
which
added
to
the
name
of
dhan
made
jourdan
the
more
correct
etymology
is
probably
or
dhan
in
hebrew
the
river
of
dhan
lower
down
between
the
houle
and
the
lake
tabaria
it
is
called
orden
by
the
inhabitants
to
the
southward
of
the
lake
of
tabaria
it
bears
the
name
of
sherya
till
it
falls
into
the
dead
sea
october
my
guide
returned
to
zahle
it
was
my
intention
to
take
a
view
of
the
lake
and
its
eastern
borders
but
a
tumour
which
threatened
to
prevent
both
riding
and
walking
obliged
me
to
proceed
immediately
to
damascus
i
had
reason
to
congratulate
myself
on
the
determination
for
if
i
had
staid
a
day
longer
i
should
have
been
compelled
to
await
my
recovery
at
some
village
on
the
road
add
to
this
i
had
only
the
value
of
four
shillings
left
after
paying
my
guide
this
alone
however
should
not
have
prevented
me
from
proceeding
as
i
knew
that
two
days
were
sufficient
to
enable
me
to
gratify
my
curiosity
and
a
guide
would
have
thought
himself
well
paid
at
two
shillings
a
day
as
to
the
other
expenses
travelling
in
the
manner
of
the
country
people
rendered
money
quite
unnecessary
there
are
two
roads
from
banias
to
damascus
the
one
lies
through
the
villages
of
koneitza
and
sasa
the
other
is
more
northly
i
took
the
latter
though
the
former
is
most
frequented
being
the
route
followed
by
all
the
pilgrims
from
damascus
and
aleppo
to
jerusalem
but
it
is
less
secure
for
a
small
caravan
owing
to
the
incursions
of
the
arabs
the
country
which
i
had
visited
to
the
westward
is
perfectly
secure
to
the
stranger
i
might
have
safely
travelled
it
alone
unarmed
and
without
a
guide
the
route
through
the
district
of
the
houle
and
banias
and
from
thence
to
damascus
on
the
contrary
is
very
dangerous
the
arabs
as
well
as
the
felahs
are
often
known
to
attack
unprotected
strangers
and
djoubeta
a
small
body
of
men
was
stripped
at
koneitza
during
my
stay
at
banias
as
soon
as
i
declared
my
wish
to
return
to
damascus
i
was
advised
by
several
people
present
to
take
a
guard
of
armed
men
with
me
but
knowing
that
this
was
merely
a
pretext
to
extort
money
without
at
all
ensuring
my
safety
i
declined
the
proposal
and
said
i
should
wait
for
a
kaffle
it
fortunately
happened
that
the
sheikh
of
the
village
had
business
at
damascus
and
we
were
glad
of
each
other
company
we
set
out
in
the
afternoon
accompanied
by
the
sheikh
servant
the
direction
of
the
route
is
up
the
mountain
of
the
heish
behind
the
castle
of
banias
we
passed
several
huts
of
felahs
who
live
here
the
whole
summer
and
retire
in
winter
to
their
villages
they
make
cheese
for
the
damascus
market
at
the
end
of
an
hour
and
a
half
we
came
to
ain
el
hazouri
a
spring
with
the
tomb
of
sheikh
othman
el
hazouri
just
over
it
to
the
north
of
it
one
hour
are
the
ruins
of
a
city
called
hazouri
the
mountain
here
is
overgrown
with
oaks
but
contains
good
pasturage
i
was
told
that
in
the
wady
kastebe
near
the
castle
there
are
oak
trees
more
than
sixty
feet
high
one
hour
more
brought
us
to
the
village
of
djoubeta
where
we
remained
during
the
night
at
the
house
of
some
friends
of
the
sheikh
of
banias
this
village
belongs
to
hasbeya
it
is
inhabited
by
about
fifty
turkish
and
ten
greek
families
they
subsist
chiefly
by
the
cultivation
of
olives
and
by
the
rearing
of
cattle
i
was
well
treated
at
the
house
where
we
alighted
and
also
at
that
of
the
sheikh
of
the
village
where
i
went
to
drink
a
cup
of
coffee
it
being
ramadan
we
passed
the
greater
part
of
the
night
in
conversation
and
smoking
the
company
grew
merry
and
knowing
that
i
was
curious
about
ruined
places
began
to
enumerate
all
the
villages
and
ruins
in
medjel
the
neighbourhood
of
which
i
subjoin
the
names

ruins
of

with

which
i
visited
in
my
tour
october
the
friends
of
the
sheikh
of
banias
having
dissuaded
him
from
proceeding
on
account
of
the
dangers
of
the
road
his
servant
and
myself
set
out
early
in
the
morning
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
we
reached
the
village
of
medjel
inhabited
by
druses
with
four
or
five
christian
families
the
druses
who
inhahit
the
country
near
damascus
are
very
punctual
in
observing
the
rites
of
the
mohammedan
religion
and
fast
or
at
least
pretend
to
do
so
during
the

profess

others
mohammedism
the

yet
all
of
them
when
they
visit
damascus
go
to
the
mosque
medjel
is
situated
on
a
small
plain
high
up
in
the
mountain
half
an
hour
further
on
is
a
spring
and
at
one
hour
and
a
quarter
beyond
is
a
spacious
plain
the
mountain
here
is
in
most
places
capable
of
cultivation
in
one
hour
more
we
reached
the
top
the
oak
tree
is
very
frequent
here
as
well
as
the
bear
plum
arabic
khoukh
eddeb
the
berries
of
which
afford
a
very
refreshing
nourishment
to
the
traveller
the
rock
is
partly
calcareous
and
partly
of
a
porous
tufa
but
softer
than
that
which
i
saw
in
the
houle
at
one
hour
and
a
quarter
farther
is
the
beit
el
djanne
the
house
of
paradise
in
a
narrow
wady
at
a
reitima
spot
where
the
valley
widens
a
little
on
its
western
side
are
several
sepulchral
caves
hewn
in
the
chalky
rock
another
quarter
of
an
hour
brought
us
to
the
ain
beit
el
djanne
a
copious
spring
with
a
mill
near
it
and
from
thence
in
half
an
hour
we
reached
the
plain
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
mountain
our
route
now
lay
by
to
the
right
was
the
open
country
adjoining
the
haouran
to
the
left
the
chain
of
the
heish
at
the
foot
of
which
we
continued
to
travel
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
the
villages
on
the
eastern
declivity
of
the
heish
between
beit

three
hours
and
a
half
from
the
point
where
the
wady
beit
el
djanne
terminates
in
the
plain
is
the
village
kferhauar
before
we
entered
it
i
saw
to
the
left
of
the
road
a
tomb
which
attracted
my
attention
by
its
size
i
was
told
that
it
was
the
kaber
nimroud
the
tomb
of
nimrod
it
consists
of
a
heap
of
stones
about
twenty
feet
in
length
two
feet
high
and
three
feet
broad
with
a
large
stone
at
both
extremities
similar
to
the
tombs
in
turkish
cemeteries
this
is
probably
the
kalat
nimroud
laid
down
in
maps
to
the
south
of
damascus
at
least
i
never
heard
of
any
kalaat
nimroud
in
that
direction
to
the
right
of
our
road
one
hour
and
a
half
from
kferhauar
lay
sasa
and
near
it
ghaptata
half
an
hour
farther
from
kferhauar
we
alighted
at
the
village
beitima
on
a
slight
eminence
near
kferhauar
stands
a
small
tower
and
there
is
another
of
the
same
size
behind
beitima
the
principal
article
of
culture
here
is
cotton
the
crop
was
just
ripe
and
the
inhabitants
were
occupied
in
collecting
it
there
are
druses
at
kferhauar
as
well
as
at
beitima
at
the
latter
village
i
passed
an
uncomfortable
rainy
night
in
the
of
a
felah
house
october
we
continued
to
follow
the
djebel
heish
which
djoun
however
takes
a
more
northern
direction
than
the
damascus
road
for
four
hours
when
we
came
to
katana
a
considerable
village
with
good
houses
and
spacious
gardens
the
river
whose
source
is
close
to
the
village
empties
itself
into
the
merj
of
damascus
three
hours
from
katana
passing
over
the
district
called
ard
el
lauan
we
came
to
kfersousa
beyond
katana
begins
the
djebel
el
djoushe
which
continues
as
far
as
the
djebel
salehie
near
damascus
uniting
on
its
western
side
the
lower
ridge
of
mountains
of
the
djebel
essheikh
kfersousa
lies
just
within
the
limits
of
the
gardens
of
the
merdj
of
damascus
in
one
hour
beyond
it
i
damascus
greatly
fatigued
having
suffered
great
pain
after
returning
to
damascus
from
my
tour
in
the
haouran
i
was
desirous
to
see
the
ruins
of
rahle
and
bourkoush
in
the
djebel
essheikh
which
i
had
heard
mentioned
by
several
people
of
rasheya
during
my
stay
at
shohba
on
the
of
december
i
took
a
man
with
me
and
rode
to
katana
by
a
route
different
from
that
through
the
ard
el
lauan
by
which
i
travelled
from
katana
to
damascus
in
october
it
passes
in
a
more
southerly
direction
through
the
villages
of
deir
raye
arabic
one
hour
beyond
bonabet
ullah
and
another
hour
djedeide
one
hour
and
a
quarter
from
djedeide
is
artous
arabic
in
which
are
many
druse
families
in
an
hour
from
artous
we
reached
katana
this
is
a
very
pleasant
road
through
well
cultivated
fields
and
groves
i
here
saw
nurseries
of
apricot
trees
which
are
transplanted
into
the
gardens
at
damascus
to
the
south
of
artous
three
quarters
of
an

rahle
and
near
the
village
sahnaya
lies
the
megarat
mar
polous
or
paul
cavern
where
the
apostle
is
related
to
have
hidden
himself
from
the
pursuit
of
his
enemies
at
damascus
the
monks
of
terra
santa
who
have
a
convent
at
damascus
had
formerly
a
chapel
at
sahnaya
where
one
of
their
fraternity
resided
but
the
roman
catholic
christians
of
the
village
having
become
followers
of
the
greek
church
the
former
abandoned
their
establishment
to
the
of
djedeide
and
half
an
hour
from

eighty
turkish

four
or
five
of

family
a
descendant
of
a
santon
whose
tomb
is
shewn
in
the
mosque
of
the
village
adjoining
to
the

a
hole
in
the
rocky
ground
over

an
apartment
has
been
built
for
the
reception
of
maniacs
they
are
put
down
into
the
hole
and
a
stone
is
placed
over
its
mouth
here
they
remain
for
three
or
four
days
after
which
as
the
turks
pretend
they
regain
their
senses
the
christians
say
that
the
santon
was
a
patriarch
of
damascus
who
left
his
flock
and
turned
hermit
and
that
he
gained
great
reputation
amongst
the
turks
because
whenever
he
prostrated
himself
before
the
deity
his
sheep
imitated
his
example
katana

a
bath
and
near
it
the
sheikh
has
a
good
house
the
villagers
cultivate
mulberry
trees
to
feed
their
silk
worms
and
some
cotton
besides
corn
the
day
after
my
arrival
i
engaged
two
men
to
shew
me
the
way
to
the
ruins
we
began
to
cross
the
lower
branches
of
the
djebel
essheikh
at
the
foot
of
which
katana
is
situated
and
after
an
hour
and
a

the
foundations
of
a
circular
building
many
fragments
of
columns

lying
about

a

extremely
well
formed
capitals
of
the
ionic
order
upon
two
larger
stones
lying
near

probably
formed

the
figure
of

its

broken
off

something
of

form
bearing
no
resemblance
to
the
usual
figure
of
the
thunderbolt
on
the
exterior
wall
on
the
south
side
of

is
a
large
head
apparently
of
a
female
three
feet

a
half
high
and
two
feet

a
half
broad
sculptured
upon
one
of
the
large
square
stones

form
the

its
features
are
perfectly
regular
and
are
enclosed
by
locks
of
hair
terminating
in
thin
tresses
under
the
chin
this
head
seems
never
to
have
belonged
to

it
is
sculptured
touches
the

near

there
remain
the

to
be

highest
of

of
the
djebel

at
the
foot
of

steep
ascent
leading
up
to
the
castle
on
the
side
is
a
copious
spring
and
another
to
the
midway
in

these
ruins
consist
of
the
outer
walls
of

built
with
large
stones
some
of
which
are
eight
feet
long
and
five
broad
a

only
of
the
walls
are
standing
in
the

are
several
apartments

have
more
the
appearance
of
dungeons
than
of

the
rock
upon
which
the
whole
structure
is
erected
has
been
levelled
so
as
to
form
an
area
within

which
ran
a

a
part
of
this
wall
is
formed
by
the
solid
rock
upwards
of
eight
feet
high
and
as
many

the
rock
having
been
cut
down
on
both
sides
to
the
of

are
the
ruins

we
returned
from

by

a

is

by
in

wady
with

is
two
hours
and
a
half
brisk
walking
of
a
horse
the
summit
of
the
mountain
was
covered
with
snow
i
heard
of
several
other
ruins
but
had
no
time
to
visit
them
there
are
several
villages
of
enzairie
in
the
mountain
on
the
third
day
from
my
departure
i
returned
to
damascus
journal
of
an
excursion
into
the
haouran
in
the
autumn
and
winter
of
november
on
returning
from
the
preceding
tour
i
was
detained
at
damascus
for
more
than
a
fortnight
by
indisposition
as
soon
as
i
had
recovered
my
health
i
began
to
prepare
for
a
journey
into
the
plain
of
the
haouran
and
the
mountains
of
the
druses
of
the
haouran
a
country
which
as
well
from
the
reports
of
natives
as
from
what
i
heard
that
seetzen
had
said
of
it
on
his
return
from
visiting
a
part
of
it
four
years
ago
i
had
reason
to
think
was
in
many
respects
highly
interesting
i
requested
of
the
pasha
the
favour
of
a
bouyourdi
or
general
passport
to
his
officers
in
the
haouran
which
he
readily
granted
and
on
receiving
it
i
found
that
i
was
recommended
in
very
strong
terms
knowing
that
there
were
many
christians
chiefly
of
the
greek
church
i
thought
it
might
be
equally
useful
to
procure
from
the
greek
patriarch
of
damascus
with
whom
i
was
well
acquainted
a
letter
to
his
flock
in
the
haouran
on
communicating
my
wishes
he
caused
a
circular
letter
to
be
written
to
all
the
priest
which
i
found
of
greater
departure
from
damascus
weight
among
the
greeks
than
the
bouyourdi
was
among
the
turks
being
thus
furnished
with
what
i
considered
most
necessary
i
assumed
the
dress
of
the
haouran
people
with
a
keffie
and
a
large
over
my
shoulders
in
my
saddle
bag
i
put
one
spare
shirt
one
pound
of
coffee
beans
two
pounds
of
tobacco
and
a
day
provender
of
barley
for
my
horse
i
then
joined
a
few
felahs
of
ezra
of
one
of
whom
i
hired
an
ass
though
i
had
nothing
to
load
it
with
but
my
small
but
i
knew
this
to
be
the
best
method
of
recommending
myself
to
the
protection
of
my
fellow
travellers
as
the
owner
of
the
ass
necessarily
becomes
the
companion
and
protector
of
him
who
hires
it
had
i
offered
to
pay
him
before
setting
out
merely
for
his
company
on
the
way
he
would
have
asked
triple
the
sum
i
gave
him
without
my
deriving
the
smallest
advantage
from
this
increase
while
he
would
have
considered
my
conduct
as
extraordinary
and
suspicious
in
my
girdle
i
had
eighty
piastres
about
sterling
and
a
few
more
in
my
pocket
together
with
a
watch
a
compass
a
journal
book
a
pencil
a
knife
and
a
tobacco
purse
the
coffee
i
knew
would
be
very
acceptable
in
the
houses
where
i
might
alight
and
throughout
the
journey
i
was
enabled
to
treat
all
the
company
present
with
coffee
my
companions
intending
to
leave
damascus
very
early
the
next
morning
i
quitted
my
lodgings
in
the
evening
and
went
with
them
to
sleep
in
a
small
khan
in
the
suburb
of
damascus
at
which
the
haouaerne
or
people
of

generally
alight

we
departed
through

took
the
road
by
which
the
hadj
annually
commences
its
laborious
journey
this
gate
is
called
bab
ullah
the
gate
of
god
but
might
with
more
propriety
be
named
the
gate
of
death

scarcely
a
third

a
devout
adherence
to
their
religion

hope
of
gain
impel

with

but
as
my
companions
were
unwilling
to
stop
i
could
not
examine
them
closely
i
expected
to
revisit
them
on
my
return
to
damascus
but
i
subsequently
preferred
taking
the
route
of
the
loehf
i
was
informed
afterwards
that
many
greek
inscriptions
are
to
be
found
at
szanamein
from
szanamein
the
hadj
route
continues
in
the
same
direction
as
before
to
tafar
and
mezerib
we
left
it
and
took
a
route
more
easterly
that
which
we
had
hitherto
travelled
being
the
high
road
from
the
haouran
to
damascus
is
perfectly
secure
and
we
met
with
numerous
parties
of
peasants
going
to
and
from
the
city
but
we
had
scarcely
passed
szanamein
when
we
were
apprised
by
some
felahs
that
a
troop
of
arabs
serdie
had
been
for
several
days
past
plundering
the
passengers
and
villages
in
the
neighbourhood
afraid
of
being
surprised
my
companions
halted
and
sewed
their
purses
up
in
a
camel
pack
saddle
i
followed
their
example
i
was
informed
that
these
flying
parties
of
arabs
very
rarely
drive
away
the
cattle
of
the
haouran
people
but
are
satisfied
with
stripping
them
of
cash
or
any
new
piece
of
dress
ezra
which
they
may
have
purchased
at
damascus
always
however

them
a

hour

along

stony

is
thence
called

szanamein
after
passing
it
we
met
some
other
haouran
people
whose
reports
concerning
the
arabs
so
terrified
my
companions
that
they
resolved
to
give
up
their
intention
of
reaching
ezra
the
same
day
and
proceeded
to
seek
shelter
in
a
neighbouring
village
there
to
wait
for
fresh
news
we
turned
off
a
little
to
our
left
and
alighted
at
a
village
called
tebne
arabic
distant
one
hour
and
a
half
from

we
left
our
beasts
in
the
of

went
to

no
water

what
it
derives
from

were
at

on
the
west
side

a
turkish
meziar
called

in
approaching
ezra
we
met
a
troop
of
about
eighty
of
the
pasha
cavalry
they
had
the
preceding
night
surprised
the
mentioned
party
of
arabs
serdie
in

had
killed

their
chief
and
six
others
whose
heads
they
were
carrying
with
them
in
a
sack
they
had
also
taken
mares
of
which
the
greater
number
were
of
the
best
arabian
breeds
afraid
of
being
pursued
by
the
friends
of
the
slain
they
were
hastening
back
to
damascus
where
as
i
afterwards
heard
the
pasha
presented
them
with
the
captured
mares
and
distributed
eight
purses
or
about
amongst
them
on
reaching
ezra
i
went
to
the
house
of
the
greek

i
had
already
seen
at
the
patriarch
at
damascus
and
with
whom
i
had
partly
concerted
my
tour
in
the
haouran
he
had
been
the
conductor
of
seetzen
and
seemed
to
be
very
ready
to
attend
me
also
for
a
trifling
daily
allowance
which
he
stipulated
ezra
is
one
of
the
principal
villages
of
the
haouran
it
contains
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
turkish
and
druse
families
and
about
fifty
of
greek
christians
it
lies
within
the
precincts
of
the
ledja
at
half
an
hour
from
the
arable
ground
it
has
no
spring
water
but
numerous
cisterns
its
inhabitants
make
cotton
stuffs
and
a
great
number
of
millstones
the
blocks
for
forming
which
are
brought
from
the
interior
of
the
ledja
the
stones
are
exported
from
hence
as
well
as
from
other
villages
in
the
loehf
over
the
greater
part
of
syria
as
far
as
aleppo
and
jerusalem
they
vary
in
price
according
to
their
size
from
fifteen
to
sixty
piastres
and
are
preferred
to
all
others
on
account
of
the
hardness
of
the
stone
which
is
the
black
tufa
rock
spread
over
the
whole
of
the
haouran
and
the
only
species
met
with
in
this
country
ezra
was
once
a
flourishing
city
its
ruins
are
between
three
and
four
miles
in
circumference
the
present
inhabitants
continue
to
live
in
the
ancient
buildings
which
in
consequence
of
the
strength
and
solidity
of
their
walls
are
for
the
greater
part
in
complete
preservation
they
are
built
of
stone
as
are
all
the
houses
of
the
villages
in
the
haouran
and
djebel
haouran
from
ghabarib
to
boszra
as
well
as
of
those
in
the
desert
beyond
the
latter
in
general
each
dwelling
has
a
small
entrance
leading
into
a
round
which
are
the
apartments
of
these
the
doors
are
usually
very
low
the
interior
of
the
rooms
is
constructed
of
large
square
stones
across
the
centre
is
a
single
arch
generally
between
two
and
three
feet
in
breadth
which
supports
the
roof
this
arch
springs
from
very
low
pilasters
on
each
side
of
the
room
and
in
some
instances
rises
immediately
from
the
floor
upon
the
arch
is
laid
the
roof
consisting
of
stone
slabs
one
foot
broad
two
inches
thick
and
about
half
the
length
of
the
room
one
end
resting
upon
short
projecting
stones
in
the
walls
and
the
other
upon
the
top
of
the
arch
the
slabs
are
in
general
laid
close
to
each
other
but
in
some
houses
i
observed
that
the
roof
was
formed
of
two
layers
the
one
next
the
arch
having
small
intervals
between
each
slab
and
a
second
layer
of
similar
dimensions
was
laid
close
together
at
right
angles
with
the
first
the
rooms
are
seldom
higher
than
nine
or
ten
feet
and
have
no
other
opening
than
a
low
door
with
sometimes
a
small
window
over
it
in
many
places
i
saw
two
or
three
of
these
arched
chambers
one
above
the
other
forming
so
many
stories
this
substantial
mode
of
building
prevails
also
in
most
of
the
ancient
public
edifices
remaining
in
the
haouran
except
that
in
the
latter
the
arch
instead
of
springing
from
the
walls
or
floor
rests
upon
two
short
columns
during
the
whole
of
my
tour
i
saw
but
one
or
two
arches
whose
curve
was
lofty
the
generality
of
them
including
those
in
the
public
buildings
are
oppressively
low
to
complete
the
durability
of
these
structures
most
of
the
doors
were
anciently
of
stone
and
of
these
many
are
still
remaining
sometimes
they
are
of
one
piece
and
sometimes
they
are
folding
doors
they
turn
upon
hinges
worked
out
of
the
stone
and
are
about
four
inches
thick
and
seldom
higher
than
about
four
feet
though
i
met
with
some
upwards
of
nine
feet
in
height
i
remained
at
ezra
in
the
priest
house
this
and
the
following
day
occupied
in
examining
the
antiquities
of
the
village
the
most
considerable
ruins
stand
to
the
of
the
present
habitations
but
few
of
the
buildings
on
that
side
have
resisted
the
destructive
hand
of
time
the
walls
however
of
most
of
them
yet
remain
and
there
are
the
remains
of
a
range
of
houses
which
to
judge
from
their
size
and
solidity
seem
to
have
been
palaces
the
ezra
people
have
given
them
the
appellation
of
seraye
malek
el
aszfar
or
the
palace
of
the
yellow
king
a
term
given
over
all
syria
as
i
have
observed
in
another
place
to
the
emperor
of
russia
the
aspect
of
these
ruins
and
of
the
surrounding
rocky
country
of
the
ledja
is
far
from
being
pleasing
the
ledja
presents
a
level
tract
covered
with
heaps
of
black
stones
and
small
irregular
shaped
rocks
without
a
single
agreeable
object
for
the
eye
to
repose
upon
on
the
west
and
north
sides
of
the
village
are
several
public
edifices
temples
churches
the
church
of
elias
arabic
in
which
the
greeks
celebrate
divine
service
is
a
round
building
of
which
the
roof
is
fallen
in
and
only
the
outer
wall
standing
on
its
side
is
a
vestibule
supported
by
three
arches
the
entrance
to
which
is
through
a
short
arched
dark
passage
over
the
entrance
is
the
following
inscription
greek
over
a
small
side
gate
i
observed
the
following
words
greek
on
the
arch
of
the
entrance
alley
greek
on
the
outer
wall
on
the
north
side
of
the
rotunda
greek
on
the
south
side
of
the
village
stands
an
edifice
dedicated
to
georgius
or
el
khouder
arabic
as
the
mohammedans
and
sometimes
the
christians
call
that
saint
it
is
a
square
building
of
about
five
feet
the
side
with
a
semicircular
projection
on
the
side
the
roof
is
vaulted
and
is
supported
by
eight
square
columns
which
stand
in
a
circle
in
the
centre
of
the
square
and
are
united
to
one
another
by
arches
they
are
about
two
feet
thick
and
sixteen
high
with
a
single
groove
on
each
side
between
the
columns
and
the
nearest
part
of
the
wall
is
a
space
of
twelve
feet
the
niche
on
the
east
side
contains
the
altar
the
vaulted
roof
is
of
modern
construction
the
building
had
two
entrances
of
which
the
southern
is
entirely
walled
up
the
western
also
is
closed
at
the
top
leaving
a
space
below
for
a
stone
door
of
six
feet
high
over
which
is
a
broad
stone
with
the
following
inscription
upon
it
greek
greek
this
was
the
third
year
of
the
emperor
theodosius
the
younger
in
whose
reign
the
final
decrees
were
issued
against
the
pagan
worship
it
appears
from
the
inscription
that
the
building
upon
which
it
is
written
was
an
ancient
temple
converted
into
a
church
of
george
editor
before
the
temple
is
a
small
paved
yard
now
used
as
the
exclusive
burial
ground
of
the
greek
priests
of
ezra
in
the
midst
of
the
present
inhabited
part
of
the
village
stand
the
ruins
of
another
large
edifice
it
was
formerly
applied
to
christian
worship
and
subsequently
converted
into
a
mosque
but
it
has
long
since
been
abandoned
it
consists
of
a
quadrangle
with
two
vaulted
colonnades
at
the
northern
and
southern
ends
each
consisting
of
a
double
row
of
five
columns
in
the
middle
of
the
area
stood
a
parallel
double
range
of
columns
of
a
larger
size
forming
a
colonnade
across
the
middle
of
the
building
the
columns
are
of
the
doric
order
and
about
sixteen
feet
high
the
side
arcades
are
still
standing
to
half
their
height
those
of
the
middle
area
are
lying
about
in
fragments
the
and
walls
of
the
building
are
also
in
ruins
over
the
entrance
gate
are
three
inscribed
tablets
only
one
of
which
built
upside
down
in
the
wall
is
legible
it
is
as
follows
greek
over
an
inner
gate
i
saw
an
inscription
much
defaced
which
seemed
to
be
in
syrian
characters
adjoining
this
building
stands
a
square
tower
about
fifty
feet
high
its
base
is
somewhat
broader
than
its
top
i
frequently
saw
similar
structures
in
the
druse
villages
and
in
szannamein
are
two
of
the
same
form
as
the
above
they
all
have
windows
near
the
summit
in
some
there
is
one
window
on
each
side
in
others
there
are
two
as
in
this
at
ezra
they
have
generally
several
stories
of
vaulted
chambers
with
a
staircase
to
ascend
into
them
to
the
of
the
village
is
the
gateway
of
another
public
building
the
interior
of
which
has
been
converted
into
private
dwellings
this
building
is
in
a
better
style
than
those
above
described
and
has
some
trifling
sculptured
ornaments
on
its
gate
on
the
wall
on
the
right
side
of
the
gate
is
this
inscription
greek
there
are
many
private
habitations
principally
at
the
end
of
the
town
with
inscriptions
over
the
doors
most
of
which
are
illegible
the
following
i
found
in
different
parts
of
the
village
on
stones
lying
on
the
ground
or
built
into
the
walls
of
houses
over
the
entrance
of
a
sepulchral
apartment
greek
i
observed
a
great
difference
in
the
characters
in
which
all
the
above
inscriptions
were
engraved
that
of
georgius
is
the
best
written
in
the
evening
i
went
to
water
my
horse
with
the
priest
cattle
at
the
spring
of
geratha
one
hour
distant
from
ezra
by
i
met
there
a
number
of
shepherds
with
theyr
flocks
the
rule
is
that
the
first
who
arrives
at
the
well
waters
his
cattle
before
the
others
several
were
therefore
obliged
to
wait
till
after
sunset
there
are
always
some
stone
basins
round
the
wells
out
of
which
the
camels
drink
the
water
being
drawn
up
by
leathern
buckets
and
poured
into
them
disputes
happen
on
these
occasions
the
well
has
a
broad
staircase
leading
down
to
it
just
by
it
lies
a
stone
with
an
inscription
of
which
i
could
make
out
only
the
following
letters
greek
this
well
is
called
rauad
november
i
left
ezra
with
the
greek
priest
to
visit
the
villages
towards
the
mountain
of
the
haouran
i
had
agreed
to
pay
him
by
the
day
but
i
soon
had
reason
to
repent
of
this
arrangement
in
order
to
protract
my
journey
and
augment
the
number
of
days
keratha
he
loaded
his
horse
with
all
his
church
furniture
and
at
almost
every
village
where
we
alighted
he
fitted
up
a
room
and
said
mass
i
was
in
consequence
seldom
able
to
leave
my
night
quarters
before
and
as
the
days
were
now
short
our
day
journey
was
not
more
than
four
or
five
hours
his
description
of
me
to
the
natives
varied
with
circumstances
sometimes
i
was
a
greek
lay
brother
sent
to
him
by
the
patriarch
a
deception
which
could
not
be
detected
by
my
dress
as
the
priesthood
is
not
distinguished
by
any
particular
dress
unless
it
be
the
blue
turban
which
they
generally
wear
sometimes
he
described
me
as
a
physician
who
was
in
search
of
herbs
and
occasionally
he
owned
that
my
real
object
was
to
examine
the
country
our
road
lay
upon
the
borders
of
the
stony
district
called
ledja
and
at
the
end
of
two
hours
we
passed
the
village
of
bousser
arabic
on
our
left
which
is
principally
inhabited
by
druses
it
lies
in
the
war
and
contains
the
turkish
place
of
pilgrimage
called
meziar
eliashaa
near
it
to
the
is
the
small
village
kherbet
hariri
in
one
hour
we
passed
baara
a
village
under
the
control
of
the
sheikh
of
ezra
and
at
half
an
hour
farther
to
our
right
the
village
eddour
arabic
the
wady
kanouat
a
torrent
which
takes
its
rise
in
the
mountain
passes
baara
where
it
turns
several
mills
in
the
winter
season
towards
the
end
of
may
it
is
generally
dried
up
at
one
hour
from
baara
is
the
ain
keratha
or
geratha
according
to
bedouin
and
haouran
pronunciation
arabic
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
in
the
war
are
several
wells
this
hill
is
covered
with
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
city
of
keratha
of
which
the
foundations
only
remain
there
had
been
such
a
scarcity
of
water
this
year
that
the
people
of
bousser
were
obliged
to
fetch
it
from
these
wells
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
them
is
the
village
nedjran
arabic
in
the
ledja
in
which
are
several
ancient
buildings
inhabited
by
druses
in
the
ledja
in
the
neighbourhood
of
keratha
medjel
are
many
spots
of
arable
ground
upon
a
low
hill
in
our
route
at
an
hour
and
a
quarter
from
the
ain
or
well
is
deir
el
khouat
arabic
the
brothers
monastery
a
heap
of
ruins
from
thence
we
travelled
to
the
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
to
the
village
sedjen
arabic
where
we
alighted
at
the
house
of
the
only
christian
family
remaining
among
the
druses
of
the
place
sedjen
is
built
like
all
these
ancient
towns
entirely
of
the
black
stone
peculiar
to
these
mountains
november
we
left
sedjen
about
noon
and
in
half
an
hour
came
to
the
spring
mezra
arabic
the
water
of
which
is
conducted
near
to
sedjen
by
an
ancient
canal
which
empties
itself
in
the
summer
time
into
a
large
pond
in
the
winter
the
stream
is
joined
by
a
number
of
small
torrents
which
descend
from
the
djebel
haouran
between
kanouat
and
soueida
it
empties
itself
farther
to
the
west
into
the
wady
kanouat
above
the
spring
is
a
ruined
castle
and
near
it
several
other
large
buildings
of
which
the
walls
only
are
standing
the
castle
was
most
probably
built
to
protect
the
water
there
is
a
tradition
that
tamerlane
filled
up
the
well
and
a
similar
story
is
repeated
in
many
parts
of
the
haouran
it
is
said
that
he
threw
into
the
springs
which
prevented
the
water
from
rising
to
the
surface
and
that
the
water
collecting
under
ground
from
several
sources
near
mezerib
at
length
burst
forth
and
formed
the
copious
spring
at
that
place
called
bushe
from
mezra
to
medjel
we
travelled
one
hour
it
rained
the
whole
day
on
arriving
at
medjel
i
alighted
to
copy
some
inscriptions
when
the
druse
sheikh
immediately
sent
for
me
to
know
what
i
was
about
it
is
a
general
opinion
with
these
people
that
inscriptions
indicate
hidden
treasure
and
that
by
reading
or
copying
them
a
knowledge
is
obtained
where
the
treasure
lies
i
often
combated
this
opinion
with
success
by
simply
asking
them
whether
if
they
chose
to
hide
their
money
under
ground
they
would
be
so
imprudent
as
to
inform
strangers
where
it
lay
the
opinion
however
is
too
strongly
rooted
in
the
minds
of
many
of
the
country
people
to
yield
to
argument
and
this
was
the
case
with
the
sheikh
of
medjel
having
asked
me
very
rudely
what
business
i
had
i
presented
to
him
the
pasha
bouyourdi
but
of
twenty
people
present
no
one
could
read
it
and
when
i
had
read
it
to
them
they
refused
to
believe
that
it
was
genuine
while
coffee
was
roasting
i
left
the
room
finished
copying
some
inscriptions
and
rode
off
in
a
torrent
of
rain
on
the
left
side
of
a
vaulted
leading
into
a
room
in
which
are
three
receptacles
for
the
dead
is
this
inscription
greek
and
opposite
to
it
on
the
right
side
of
the
in
large
characters

over
the
eastern
church

on
the
northern

on
two
stones
built
into
the
wall
of
a
house
on
the
side
of
the
road
beyond
the
village
greek
there
are
two
other
buildings
in
the
town
which
i
suppose
to
have
been
sepulchral
in
one
of
them
is
a
long
inscription
but
the
rain
had
made
it
illegible
we
rode
on
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
farther
to
the
village
kafer
el
loehha
arabic
situated
in
the
wady
kanouat
on
the
borders
of
the
ledja
i
here
passed
a
comfortable
evening
in
the
company
of
some
druses
who
conversed
freely
with
me
on
their
relations
with
their
own
sheikhs
and
with
the
surrounding

which
have
been
made
in

in
search
of
hidden

beneath
it
is
a
subterraneous
apartment
in
which
is
a
double
row

five
feet
and
a
half
long
the
door
is
so
low
as
hardly
to
allow
a
person
to
creep
in
i
copied
the
following
from
a
stone
in
an
adjoining
wall
greek
this
village
has
two
birkets
or
reservoirs
for
water
which
are
filled
in

time
by
a
branch
of
the
wady
kanouat
they
were
completely
dried
up

a
circumstance
which
rarely
happens

has
fallen
in
over
the
door
of
one
of

i
read
the

hence
it
appears
that

has
preserved
its
ancient

ed
half
an

a
ruined
uninhabited
village
upon

we
advanced
half
an
hour
to
the
village
mourdouk
arabic
on
the
declivity
of
the
djebel
haouran
it
has
a
spring
from
whence
the
druses
of

and
bereike
obtain
their
daily
supply
of
water
from
the
spring
we
proceeded
to
the
eastward
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
at

it
terminates

is
an
intermediate
plain
of
about
one
hour
in

and
for
the
greater

uncultivated
before

which
is
the
highest

they
are
distant
from

arabic
the
seat
of
the

sheikhs
and
containing
also
some
turkish
and
christian
families
it
lies
near
the
foot
of
tel
shohba
between
the
latter
and
the
mountain
it
was
formerly
one
of
the
chief
cities
in
these
districts
as
is
attested
by
its
remaining
town
walls
and
the
loftiness
of
its
public
edifices
the
walls
may
be
traced
all
round
the
city
and
are
perfect
in
many
places
there
are
eight
gates
with
a
paved
causeway
leading
from
each
into
the
town
each
gate
is
formed
of
two
arches
with
a
post
in
the
centre
the
eastern
gate
seems
to
have
been
the
principal
one
and
the
street
into
which
it
opens
leads
in
a
straight
line
through
the
town
like
the
other
streets
facing
the
gates
it
is
paved
with
oblong
flat
stones
laid
obliquely
across
it
with
great
regularity
following
this
street
through
a
heap
of
ruined
habitations
on
each
side
of
it
where
are
many
fragments
of
columns
i
came
to
a
place
where
four
massy
cubical
structures
formed
a
sort
of
square
through
which
the
street
runs
they
are
built
with
square
stones
are
twelve
feet
long
by
nine
high
and
as
appears
by
one
of
them
which
is
partly
broken
down
are
quite
solid
the
centre
being
filled
up
with
stones
farther
on
to
the
right
upon
a
terrace
stand
five
corinthian
columns
two
feet
and
a
quarter
in
diameter
all
quite
entire
after
passing
these
columns
i
came
to
the
principal
building
in
this
part
of
the
town
it
is
in
the
form
of
a
crescent
fronting
towards
the
east
without
any
exterior
ornaments
but
with
several
niches
in
the
front
i
did
not
venture
to
enter
it
as
i
had
a
bad
opinion
of
its
present
possessor
the
chief
of
shohba
who
some
years
ago
compelled
seetzen
to
turn
back
from
hence
towards
soueida
i
remained
unknown
to
the
druses
during
my
stay
at
shohba
before
the
above
mentioned
building
is
a
deep
and
large
reservoir
lined
with
small
stones
to
the
right
of
it
stands
another
large
edifice
of
a
square
shape
built
of
massy
stones
with
a
spacious
gate
its
interior
consists
of
a
double
range
of
vaults
one
above
the
other
of
which
the
lower
one
is
choaked
up
as
high
as
the
capitals
of
the
columns
which
support
the
arches
i
found
the
following
inscription
upon
an
arch
in
the
upper
story
greek
beyond
and
to
the
left
of
this
last
mentioned
building
in
the
same
street
is
a
vaulted
passage
with
several
niches
on
both
sides
of
it
and
dark
apartments
destined
probably
for
the
reception
of
the
bodies
of
the
governors
of
the
city
farther
on
are
the
remaining

of
a
large

i
had
seen
several

the

of

terminates
and
the

the
village
is
another
of
still
larger
circumference
but
not
so
deep
also
lined
with
stone
called
birket

from
the
circumstance
of
its
having
till
within
the
last
century
been
a
watering
place
for
the
hadj
which
used
to
pass
here
to
the
west
of
soueida
on
the
other
side
of
the
wady
stands
a
ruined
building
which
the
country
people
call
doubeise
it
is
a
perfect
square
of
thirteen
paces
with
walls
two
feet
thick
and
ornamented
on
each
side
with
six
doric
pilasters
sixteen
spans

is
the
following
inscription
in
handsome
characters
greek
soueida
was
formerly
one
of
the
largest
cities
of
the
haouran
the
circuit
of
its
ruins
is
at
least
four
miles
amongst
them
is
a
street
running
in
a
straight
line
in
which
the
houses
on
both
sides
are
still
standing
i
was
twelve
minutes
in
walking
from
one
end
to
other
like
the
streets
of
modern
cities
in
the
east
this
is
so
very
narrow
as
to
allow
space
only
for
one
person
or
beast
to
pass
on
both
sides
is
a
narrow
pavement
the
great
variety
seen
in
the
the
mode
of
construction
of
the
houses
seems
to
prove
that
the
town
has
been
inhabited
by
people
of
different
nations
in
several
places
on
both
sides
of
the
street
are
small
arched
open
rooms
which
i
supposed
to
have
been
shops
the
street
commences
in
the
upper
part
of
the
town
at
a
large
arched
gate
built
across
it
descending
from
thence
i
came
to
an
elegant
building
in
the
shape
of
a
crescent
the
whole
of
whose
front
forms
a
kind
of
niche
within
which
are
three
smaller
niches
round
the
flat
roof
is
written
in
large
characters
greek
on
a
stone
lying
upon
the
roof
greek
continuing
along
the
street
i
entered
on
the
left
an
edifice
with
four
rows
of
arches
built
with
very
low
pillars
in
the
ugly
style
already
described
upon
a
stone
built
upside
down
in
one
of
the
interior
walls
was
this
greek
greek
the
fourteenth
legion
was
surnamed
gemina
see
several
inscriptions
in
gruter
ed
at
the
lower
end
of
the
street
is
a
tower
about
thirty
feet
high
and
eighteen
square
turning
from
the
beginning
of
the
street
to
the
south
i
met
with
a
large
building
in
ruins
with
many
broken
pillars
it
seems
to
have
been
a
church
and
it
is
joined
to
another
building
which
has
the
appearance
of
having
once
been
a
monastery
in
the
paved
area
to
the
of
it
lies
a
water
trough
formed
of
a
single
stone
two
feet
and
a
half
in
breadth
and
seven
feet
in
length
ornamented
with
four
busts
in
relief
whose
heads
have
been
knocked
off
in
a
stony
field
about
three
hundred
yards
of
the
sheikh
house
i
found
engraved
upon
a
rock
greek
kanouat
round
a
pedestal
which
now
serves
to
support
one
of
the
columns
in
the
front
of
the
sheikh
house
is
the
following
greek
on
the
side
of
the
pedestal
is
a
figure
of
a
bird
with
expanded
wings
about
one
foot
high
and
below
it
is
a
man
hand
grasping
at
something
near
the
sheikh
house
stands
a
colonnade
of
corinthian
columns
which
surrounded
a
building
now
entirely
in
ruins
but
which
appears
to
have
been
destined
for
sepulchres
as
there
are
some
small
arched
doors
quite
choaked
up
leading
to
subterraneous
apartments
november
we
rode
to
the
ruined
city
called
kanouat
arabic
two
hours
to
the
of
soueida
the
road
lying
through
a
forest
of
stunted
oaks
and
zarour
trees
with
a
few
cultivated
fields
among
them
kanouat
is
situated
upon
a
declivity
on
the
banks
of
the
deep
wady
kanouat
which
flows
through
the
midst
of
the
town
and
whose
steep
banks
are
supported
by
walls
in
several
places
to
the
of
the
town
is
a
copious
spring
on
approaching
kanouat
from
the
side
of
soueida
the
first
object
that
struck
my
attention
was
a
number
of
high
columns
upon
a
terrace
at
some
distance
from
the
town
they
enclosed
an
oblong
square
fifteen
paces
in
breadth
by
in
length
there
were
originally
six
columns
on
one
side
and
seven
on
the
other
including
the
corner
columns
in
both
numbers
at
present
six
only
remain
and
the
bases
of
two
others
they
are
formed
of
six
pieces
of
stone
and
measure
from
the
top
of
the
pedestal
to
the
base
of
the
capital
feet
the
height
of
the
pedestal
is
five
feet
the
circumference
of
the
column
six
feet
the
capitals
are
elegant
and
well
finished
on
the
northern
side
was
an
inner
row
of
columns
of
somewhat
smaller
dimensions
than
the
outer
row
of
these
one
only
is
standing
within
the
square
of
columns
is
a
row
of
subterraneous
apartments
these
ruins
stand
upon
a
terrace
ten
feet
high
on
the
side
of
which
is
a
broad
flight
of
steps
the
pedestals
of
all
the
columns
had
inscriptions
upon
them
but
nothing
can
now
be
clearly
distinguished
except
greek
upon
one
of
them
two
divisions
of
the
town
may
be
distinguished
the
upper
or
principal
and
the
lower
the
whole
ground
upon
which
the
ruined
habitations
stand
is
overgrown
with
oak
trees
which
hide
the
ruins
in
the
lower
town
over
the
door
of
an
edifice
which
has
some
arches
in
its
interior
and
which
has
been
converted
in
modern
times
into
a
greek
church
is
an
inscription
in
which
the
words
greek
only
were
distinguishable
a
street
leads
up
to
this
building
paved
with
oblong
flat
stones
placed
obliquely
across
the
road
in
the
same
manner
which
i
have
described
at
shohba
here
are
several
other
buildings
with
pillars
and
arches
the
principal
of
them
has
four
small
columns
in
front
of
the
entrance
and
an
leading
to
an
inner
apartment
which
is
supported
by
five
arches
the
door
of
the
is
of
one
stone
as
usual
in
this
country
but
it
is
distinguished
by
its
sculptured
ornaments
a
stone
in
this
building
lying
on
the
ground

and
grapes
and
over
the
entrance
is
the
figure
of
the
cross
in
the
midst
of
a
bunch
of
grapes
i
observed
similar
ornaments
on
the
great
gate
at
shakka
and
i
have
often
seen
them
since
over
the
entrances
of
public
edifices
in
the
interior
of
the
area
on
the
side
is
a
niche
sixteen
feet
deep
arched
at
the
bottom
with
small
vaulted
rooms
on
both
its
sides
in
which
there
is
no
other
opening

sides
the
building
is
enclosed
by
a
large
paved
area
at
a
short
distance
from

is
another
building
whose
entrance
is
through
a
portico
consisting
of
four
columns
in

and
of
two
others
behind
between
two
wings
on
the
inner

and
a
half
in

part
of
the

are
standing
in
the
wall
opposite
the
entrance
are
two
niches
one
above
the
other
not
far
from
this
building
toward
its
western
side
i
found
lying
upon
the
ground
the
trunk
of
a
female
statue
of
very
inelegant
form
and
coarse
execution
my
companion
the
priest
spat
upon
it
when
i
told
him
that
such
idols
were
anciently
objects
of
adoration
by
its
side
lay
a
well
executed
female
foot
i
may
here
mention
for
the
information
of
future
travellers
in
these
parts
that
on
my
return
to
soueida
i
was
told
that
there
was
a
place
near
the
source
of
spring
water
where
a
great
number
of
figures
of
men
women
beasts
and
men
riding
naked
on
horses
were
lying
upon
the
ground
besides
the
buildings
just
mentioned
there
are
several
towers
with
two
stories
upon
arches
standing
insulated
in
different
parts
of
the
town
in
one
of
them
i
observed
a
peculiarity
in
the
structure
of
its
walls
which
i
had
already
seen
at
hait
and
which
i
afterwards
met
with
in
several
other
places
the
stones
are
cut
so
as
to
dovetail
and
fit
very
closely
the
circuit
of
this
ancient
city
may
be
about
two
miles
and
a
half
or
three
miles
from
the
spring
there
is
a
beautiful
view
into
the
plain
of
the
haouran
bounded
on
the
opposite
side
by
the
mountain
of
the
heish
now
covered

were
only
ezzehoue

druse
families
at

were
occupied
in
cultivating
a
few
tobacco
fields

returned
to
soueida
by
the
same
road
which
i
had
come
november
after
having
made
the
tour
of
the
city
i
took
coffee
at
the
house
of
the
sheikh
whose
brother
and
sons
received
me
very
politely
and
i
visited
some
sick
people
in
the
village
for
i
was
continually
pressed
wherever
i
went
to
write
receipts
for
the
sick
i
then
left
soueida
with
the
intention
of
sleeping
the
following
night
in
some
arab
tent
in
the
mountain
where
i
wished
to
see
some
ruined
villages
the
priest
fear
of
catching
cold
prevented
me
from
proceeding
according
to
my
wishes

arrived
in

invited
me
to
breakfast
with
him
but
i
was
well
treated
by
the
poor
christian
family
when
i
left
the
village
there
was
a
rumor
amongst
the
druses
that
i
should
not
be
permitted
to
depart
or
if
i
was

i
should
be
waylaid
on

one
of
the
most
amiable
men
i
have
met
with
in
the

and
what
is
still
more
extraordinary
he
is
extremely
desirous
to
acquire
knowledge
in
the
conversations
i
had
with
him
during
my
repeated
visits
at
aaere
he
was
always
most
anxious
to
obtain
information
concerning

begged

one
day
to
write
down
for
him
the
greek
english

with
the
corresponding
sound
in

he
shewed
me
the
copy

his
kindness
towards
me

the
more
remarkable
as
he
could
not

admired

had
two

offering
it
to
him
these
druses
as
well
as
those
of
kesrouan
firmly
believe
that
there
are
a
number
of
druses
in
england
a
belief
originating
in
the
declaration
of
the
christians
in
these
countries
that
the
english
are
neither
greeks
nor
catholics
and
therefore
not
christians
upon
a
stone
in
the
village
i
copied
the
following
xxxxx
november
being
desirous
of
visiting
the
parts
of
the
haouran
bordering
upon
the
desert
of
crossing
the
djebel
haouran
or
mountainous
part
of
the
district
and
of
exploring
several
ruined
hebran
cities
which
i
had
heard
of
in
the
desert
i
engaged
with
the
sheikh
permission
two
druses
and
a
christian
to
act
as
guides
as
there
was
considerable
risque
of
meeting
with
some
hostile
tribe
of
arabs
on
the
road
i
gave
my
purse
to
the
greek
priest
who
promised
to
wait
for
my
return
he
did
not
keep
his
word
however
for
he
quitted
aaere
taking
my
money
with
him
no
doubt
in
the
view
of
compelling
me
to
follow
him
to
his
village
from
whence
he
might
again
have
a
chance
of
obtaining
a
daily
allowance
by
accompanying
me
though
he
well
knew
that
it
was
my
intention
to
return
to
damascus
by
a
more
western
route
nor
was
this
all
he
took
twenty
piastres
out
of
my
purse
to
buy
straw
for
his
camels
on
his
repeatedly
confessing
to
me
afterwards
his
secret
wishes
that
some
frank
nation
would
invade
and
take
possession
of
the
country
i
told
him
that
he
would
by
no
means
be
a
gainer
by
such
an
event
as
a
trick
such
as
that
he
had
played
me
would
expose
him
to
be
turned
out
of
his
living
and
thrown
into
a
prison
you
must
imprison
all
the
people
of
the
country
then
was
his
reply
and
he
spoke
the
truth
i
have
often
reflected
that
if
the
english
penal
laws
were
suddenly
promulgated
in
this
country
there
is
scarcely
any
man
in
business
or
who
has
with
others
who
would
not
be
found
liable
to
transportation
before
the
end
of
the
first
six
months
our
road
lay
over
the
plain
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
we
then
began
to
mount
by
a
slight
ascent
in
an
hour
and
a
quarter
we
came
to
two
hills
with
the
ruins
of
a
village
called
medjmar
arabic
on

from
hebran
towards
the

or
as
the

here
call
it

in
one
houre
we
came
to
kuffer
arabic

a
considerable
town

is
built
in
the
usual
style
of
this
country
entirely
of
stone
most
of
the

doors
are
uniformly
of

my
guides
had
killed
these
birds

are
in
immense

here
but
i
found
none

the
copious

already
mentioned
called

from
which
we
had
passed
at
ezzehhoue
there
is
a
small
building
over
it
on
which
are
these
letters
greek
we
arrived
after
sunset
in
one
hour
from
kuffer
at
an
encampment
of
arabs
rawafie
immediately
at
the
foot
of
the
kelab
and
there
took
up
our
quarters
for
the
night
the
tent
of
our
host
was
very
neat
being
formed
with
alternate
white
and
black
shoukes
or
cloth
made
of
hair
i
here
found
the
meharem
to
the
right
of
the
man
apartment
we
were
treated
as
usual
with
coffee
and
feita
i
had
been
rather
feverish
during
the
whole
day
and
in
the
evening
the
symptoms
increased
but
cold
as
the
night
was
and
more
especially
on
the
approach
of
morning
wady
awairid
when
the
fire
which
is
kept
up
till
midnight
gradually
dies
out
i
found
myself
completely
recovered
the
next
day
this
encampment
consisted
of
ten
or
twelve
tents
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
which
surrounds
the
kelab
november
the
kelab
is
a
cone
rising
from
the
lower
ridge
of
the
mountains
it
is
barren
on
the
and
sides
but
covered
on
the
and
with
the
trees
common
to
these
mountains
i
was
told
that
in
clear
weather
the
sea
is
visible
from
its
top
the
ascent
to
which
from
the
encampment
was
said
to
be
one
hour
the
morning
was
beautiful
but
very
cold
the
whole
mountain
being
covered
with
hoar
frost
we
set
off
at
and
rode
through
the
forest
one
hour
when
we
breakfasted
at
an
encampment
of
arabs
shennebele
in
the
midst
of
the
wood
from
thence
i
took
two
arabs
who
volunteered
their
services
to
guide
me
over
the
mountains
into
the
eastern
plain
we
soon
reached
the
termination
of
the
forest
and
in
half
an
hour
passed
the
merdj
el
kenttare
arabic
a
fine
meadow
where
the
young
grass
had
already
made
its
appearance
in
the
midst
of
the
rocky
mountain
which
has
no
wood
here
a
rivulet
called
el
keine
arabic
whose
source
is
a
little
higher
up
in
the
mountain
flows
through
the
meadow
three
quarters
of
an
hour
farther
and
to
the
right
of
the
road
upon
a
hill
distant
half
an
hour
are
the
ruins
of
the
village
el
djefne
to
the
left
at
the
same
distance
is
tel
akrabe
we
passed
many
excellent
pasturing
places
where
the
arabs
of
the
mountain
feed
their
cattle
in
the
spring
but
the
mountain
is
otherwise
quite
barren
half
an
hour
farther
descending
the
mountain
we
passed
wady
awairid
arabic
whose
torrent
in
winter
flows
as
far
as
rohba
a
district
so
called
where
is
a
ruined
city
of
the
same
name
on
the
eastern
limits
of
the
szaffa
the
szaffa
arabic
is
a
stony
district
much
resembling
the
ledja
with
this
difference
that
the
rocks
with
which
it
is
covered
are
considerably
larger
although
the
whole
may
be
said
to
be
even
ground
it
is
two
or
three
days
in
circumference
and
is
the
place
of
refuge
of
the
arabs
who
fly
from
the
pasha
troops
or
from
their
enemies
in
the
desert
the
szaffa
has
no
springs
the
rain
water
is
collected
in
cisterns
the
only
entrance
is
through
a
narrow
pass
called
bab
el
szaffa
a
cleft
between
high
perpendicular
rocks
not
more
than
two
yards
in
breadth
which
one
ever
dared
to
enter
as
an
enemy
if
a
tribe
of
arabs
intend
to
remain
a
whole
year
in
the
szaffa
they
sow
wheat
and
barley
on
the
spots
fit
for
cultivation
on
its
precincts
on
its
limits
are
the
ruined
villages
of
boreisie
oedesie
and
el
koneyse
on
its
western
side
this
district
is
called
el
harra
a
term
applied
by
the
arabs
to
all
tracts
which
are
covered
with
small
stones
being
derived
from
harr

reflected
from
the
ground
our
route
lay
to
the

zaele
descended
by
the
banks
of
the
wady
into
the

and
at
a
short
distance
from
where
the

enters
it
arrived
at
zaele
arabic
in
two
hours
and
three
quarters
from
the
arab
encampment
where
we
had
breakfasted
zaele
owes
its
origin
to
the
copious
spring
which
rises
there
and
which
renders
it
in
summer
time
a
much
frequented
watering
place
of
the
arabs
the
ruined
city
which
stands
near
the
spring
is
half
an
hour
in
circuit
it
is
built
like
all
those
of
the
mountain
but
i
observed
that
the
stone
doors
were
particularly
low
scarcely
permitting
one
even
to
creep
in
a
cupola
once
stood
over
the
spring
and
its
basin
was
paved
i
found
the
following

upon
a
stone
lying
there

another
above
the

upon
a
terrace
adjoining
the
ruins

there
is
still
a
good
arable
soil
intersected
by
numerous
tels

covered
with
the
ruins
of
so
many
cities
and
villages
that
as
i
was
informed
in
whatever
direction
it
is
crossed
the
traveller
is
sure
to
pass
in
every
day
five
or
six
of
these
ruined
places
they
are
all
built
of
the
same
black
rock
of
which
the
djebel
consists
the
name
of
the

changes
in
every
district
and
the
whole
is
sometimes
called

from
its

no
where
met
with

water
is
easily
found
on
digging
to
the

the

on
the
other
to
the
of
wady
serethan
as
far
as
the
djof
i
wished
to
proceed
to
melleh
but
my
druse
companions
were
not
to
be
prevailed
upon
through
fear
of
the
arabs
sheraka
a
tribe
of
the
arabs
djelaes
who
were
said
to
be
in
that
neighbourhood
we
herefore
recrossed
the
mountain
from
zaele
and
passed
its
corner
on
which
there
are
no
trees
but
many
spots
of
excellent
pasture
in
two
hours
from
zaele
we
came
to
a
spring
called
ras
el
beder
arabic
the
moon
head
whose
waters
flow
down
into
the
plain
as
far
as
boszra
from
the
spring
we
redescended
and
reached
zahouet
el
khudher
arabic
a
ruined
city
standing
in
a
wady
at
a
short
distance
from
the
zahouet
el

one

from
these

a
rivulet

through
the
valley
whose
source
is
to
the
up
in
the
mountain
one
hour
distant
near
a
ruined
place
called
maaz
this
is
a
very
romantic
secluded
spot
immediately
behind
the
town
the
valley
closes
and
a
row
of
willows
skirting
both
banks
of
the
rivulet
in
its
descent
agreeably
surprise
the
traveller
who
rarely
meets
in
these
districts
with
trees
raised
by
the
labour
of
man
but
it
is
probable
that
these
willows
will
not
long
withstand
the
destroying
hands
of
the
arabs
fifteen
years
ago
there
was
a
larger
plantation
here
which
was
cut
down
for
fire
wood
and
every
summer
many
of
the
trees
share
the
same
fate
zahouet
el
khudher
was
formerly
visited
by
the
christians
of
the
haouran
for
the
purpose
of
offering
up
their
prayers
to
the
khudher
or
george
to
whom
a
church
in
the
bottom
of
the
valley
is
dedicated
the
turks
also
pay
great
veneration
to
this
saint
so
much
so
that
a
few
mats
worth
five
or
six
piastres
which
are
left
on
the
floor
of
the
sanctuary
of
the
church
are
safe
from
the
robbers
my
druse
guides
carried
them
to
a
house
in
the
town
to
sleep
upon
but
returned
them
carefully
on
the
following
morning
the
arabs
give
the
name
of
abd
maaz
to
george
the

a
ruined

side
of
the
wady
stands
the
small
ruined
town
of
zahouet
with
a
castle
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
i
could
find
no
legible
inscriptions
there
we
had
reached
zahouet
after
sunset
and
the
dread
of
arabs
who
very
frequently
visit
this
place
made
us
seek
for
a
night
shelter
in
the
upper
part
of
the
town
where
we
found
a
comfortable
room
and
lighted
a
still
more
comfortable
fire
we
had
tasted
nothing
since
our
breakfast
and
my
guides
in
the
full
confidence
of
meeting
with
plenty
of
kattas
and
partridges
on
our
road
had
laid
in
a
very
small
provision
of
bread
on
setting
out
but
had
brought
a
sack
of
flour
mixed
with
salt
after
the
arab
fashion
unluckily
we
had
killed
only
two
partridges
during
the
day
and
seen
no
kattas
we
therefore
had
but
a
scanty
supper
towards
midnight
we
were
alarmed
by
the
sound
of
persons
breaking
up
wood
to
make
a
fire
and
we
kept
upon
our
guard
till
near
when
we
proceeded
and
saw
upon
the
wet
ground
the
traces
of
men
and
dogs
who
had
passed
the
night
in
the
church
probably
as
much
in
fear
of
strangers
as
we
were
ourselves
november
i
took
a
view
of
the
town
after
which
we
descended
into
the
plain
called
here
ard
aaszaf
arabic
from
a
tel
named
aazaf
at
half
an
hour
from
the
khudher
the
abundant
rains
had
already
covered
the
plain
with
rich
verdure
our
way
lay
at
the
end
of
an
hour
and
a
quarter
we
saw
to
our
left
one
mile
distant
from
the
road
a
ruined
castle
upon
a
tel
called
keres

close
to

well
cultivated

so
called
one
hour
and
a
half
in

i
saw
in
the
town
four
public
edifices
with
arches
in
their
interior
one
of
them
is
distinguished
by
the
height
and
fine
curve
of
the
arches
as
well
as
by
the
complete
state
of
the
whole

lost
its
original
black
colour
and
now
presents
a
variety
of
hues
which
on
my
entering
surprised
me
much
as
i
at
first
supposed
it
to
be
painted
the
door
is
ornamented
with
grapes
and
vine
leaves
there
is
another
large
building
in
which
are
three
doors
only
three

over

are

distant
one

a

in
the

oerman
is
an
ancient
city
somewhat
larger
than
ayoun
in
it
are
three
towers
or
steeples
built
in
the
usual
mode
which
i
have
described
at
kuffer
on
the
walls
of
a
miserable
building
adjoining
the
side
of
the
town
are
the
following
six
inscribed
tablets
built
into
the

that
they

over

the
following
greek
oerman
has
a
spring
but
my
guides
afraid
of
prolonging
our
stay
in
these
desert
parts
denied
its
existence
when
i
enquired
for
it
i
was
informed
afterwards
that
a
large
stone
on
which
is
an
inscription
lies
near
it
there
are
also
several
birkets
from
oerman
we
proceeded
one
hour
and
a
quarter
to
the
town
and
castle
called
szalkhat
arabic
the
intermediate
country
is
full
of
ruined
walls
the
soil
of
the
desert
as
well
here
szalkhat
as
between
zahouet
and
oerman
is
black
and
notwithstanding
the
abundant
rains
the
ground
was
intersected
in
every
direction
by
large
fissures
caused
by
the
summer
heat
the
castle
of
szalkhat
is
situated
upon
a
hill
at
the
southern
foot
of
the
szfeikh
the
town
which
occupies
the
south
and
west
foot
of
the
castle
hill
is
now
uninhabited
but
fifteen
years
since
a
few
druse
and
christian
families
were
established
here
as
well
as
at
oerman
the
latter
retired
to
khabeb
where
i
afterwards
saw
them
and
where
they
are
still
called
szalkhalie
the
town
contains
upwards
of
eight
hundred
houses
but
presents
nothing
worthy
of
observation
except
a
large
mosque
with
a
handsome
madene
or
minaret
the
mosque
was
built
in
the
year
of
the
hedjra
or
as
appears
from
an
inscription
upon
it
the
minaret
is
only
two
hundred
years
old
but
even
the
mosque
seems
to
have
been
nothing
more
than
a
repaired
temple
or
church
as
there
are
several
well
wrought
niches
in
its
outer
walls
and
the
interior
is
vaulted
with
arches
supported
by
low
pillars
similar
to
those
which
have
been
before
described
several
stones
are
lying
about
with
greek
inscriptions
but
all
so
much
defaced
as
to
be
no
longer
legible
within
the
mosque
lies
a
large
stone
with
a
cut
upon
it
in
the
of
the
houses
of
the
town
are
a
great
number
of
fig
and
pomegranate
trees
the
former
were
covered
with
ripe
fruit
and
as
we
had
tasted
nothing
this
day
but
dry
flour
we
made
a
hearty
dinner
of
the
figs
there
is
no
spring
either
in
the
castle
or
town
of
szalkhat
but
every
house
has
a
deep
cistern
lined
with
stone
there
is
also
a
large
birket
the
castle
stands
upon
the
very
summit
of
the
hill
and
forms
a
complete
circle
it
is
a
very
commanding
position
and
of
the
first
importance
as
a
defence
of
the
haouran
against
the
arabs
it
is
surrounded
by
a
deep
ditch
which
separates
the
top
of
the
hill
from
the
part
immediately
below
it
i
walked
round
the
outside
of
the
ditch
in
twelve
minutes
the
upper
hill
except
in
places
where
the
rock
is
firm
is
paved
with
large
flat
stones
similar
to
those
of
the
castle
of
aleppo
a
number
of
these
stones
as
well
as
parts
of
the
wall
have
fallen
down
and
in
many
places
have
filled
up
the
ditch
to
half
its
depth
i
estimated
the
height
of
the
paved
upper
hill
to
be
sixty
yards
a
high
arched
bridge
leads
over
the
ditch
into
the
castle
the
wall
of
the
castle
is
of
moderate
thickness
flanked
all
round
by
towers
and
turrets
pierced
with
numerous
loop
holes
and
is
constructed
of
small
square
stones
like
some
of
the
eastern
walls
of
damascus
most
of
the
interior
apartments
of
the
castle
are
in
complete
ruins
in
several
of
them
are
deep
wells
on
entering
i
observed
over
the
gate
a
well
sculptured
eagle
with
expanded
wings
hard
by
on
the
left
of
the
entrance
are
two
capitals
of
columns
placed
one
upon
the
other
each
adorned
with
four
busts
in
relief
projecting
from
a
cluster
of
palm
leaves
the
heads
of
the
busts
are
wanting
the
sculpture
is
indifferent
a
covered
way
leads
from
the
inside
of
the
gateway
into
the
interior
of
this
i
took
a
very
cursory
view
as
the
day
was
near
closing
and
my
companions
pressed
me
very
much
to
depart
that
we
might
reach
a
village
three
hours
distant
there
being
no
water
here
for
my
horse
i
the
more
readily
complied
with
their
wishes
over
the
entrance
of
a
tower
in
the
interior
i
read
these
two
lines
arabic
in
the
name
of
god
the
merciful
and
the
munificent
during
the
reign
of
the
equitable
king
the
emir
ordered
the
building
of
this
castle
which
makes
it
probable
that
it
was
erected
for
the
defence
abd
maaz
of
the
country
against
the
crusaders
in
one
of
the
apartments
i
found
just
appearing
above
the
earth
the
upper
part
of
a
door
built
of
calcareous
stone
a
material
which
i
have
not
met
with
in
any
part
of
the
haouran
over
it
is
the
following
inscription
in
well
engraved
characters
greek
upon
the
architrave
of
the
door
on
both
sides
of
the
inscription
are
masques
in
in
an
apartment
where
i
saw
several
small
entrances
to
sepulchres
and
where
there
are
several
columns
lying
about
is
this
greek
and
on
a
stone
in
the
wall
of
the
same
apartment
greek
the
hill
upon
which
the
castle
stands
consists
of
alternate
layers
of
the
common
black
tufwacke
of
the
country
and
of
a
very
porous
deep
red
and
often
in
some
caverns
formed
in
the

great
quantities

towards

on
a
rainy
evening
in

to
reach
kereye
a
village
three
good
hours
distant
in
one
hour
we
passed
the
ruined
village

with
a
copious
spring
near
it
our
route
lay
through
a
stony
plain
and
the
night
now
becoming
very
dark
with
incessant
rain
my
guides
lost
their
way
and
we
continued
for
three
hours
uncertain
whether
we
should
not
be
obliged
to
take
up
our
night
quarters
in
the
open
plain
at
length
however
we
came
to
the
bed
of
a
wady
called
hameka
which
we
ascended
for
a
short
distance
and
in
half
an
hour
after
crossing
it
reached
kereye
about
ten
at
night
here
we
found
a
comfortable
fellah

a

a
city
containing
about
five
hundred

several
ancient

public
buildings

the
principal

in

remarkable
for
the
antiquity
of
its
castle
and
the
ancient
ruins
and
inscriptions
to
be
found
there
i
wished
very
much
to
visit
it
and
might
have
done
so
in
perfect
safety
and
without
expense
but
i
knew
that
there
was
a
garrison
of
between
three
and
four
hundred
moggrebyns
in
the
town
a
class
of
men
which
from
the
circumstance
of
their
passing
from
one
service
to
another
i
was
particularly
desirous
of
avoiding
it
was
very
probable
that
i
might
afterwards
meet
with
some
of
the
individuals
of
this
garrison
in
egypt
where
they
would
not
have
failed
to
recognize
my
person
in
consequence
of
the
remarkable
circumstance
of
my
visit
to
boszra
but
as
i
did
not
think
proper
to
state
these
reasons
to
my
guides
who
of
course
expected
me
to
examine
the
greatest
curiosity
in
the
haouran
i
told
them
that
i
had
had
a
dream
which
made
it
advisable
for
me
not
to
visit
this
place
they
greatly
applauded
my
prudent
determination
accustomed
as
they
had
been
to
look
upon
me
as
a
person
who
had
a
secret
to
insure
his
safety
when
travelling
about
in
such
dangerous
places
we
therefore
left
kereye
in
the
morning
and
proceeding
reached

famed
over
all
the

for
the
immense
treasures
said
to
be
buried
there
whenever
i
was
asked
by
the
fellahs
where
i
had
been
they
never
failed
to
enquire
particularly
whether
i
had
seen
houshhoush
the
small
ancient
village
contains
nothing
remarkable
except
a
church
supported
by
a
single

rests
on

much
higher
than
those
generally
seen
in
this
country
at

we
found
here
a
great
number
of
mushrooms
we
had
met
with
some
at
szalkhat
my
guides
taught
me
to
eat
them
raw
with
a
morsel
of
bread
the
quantity
of
kattas
here
was
beyond
description
the
whole

seemed
sometimes
to
rise

far
off

were
seen

i
proceeded

from
the
lying
down

the

often
rise
over

farther
to

this

joins

travelled
to

about
an
hour

were
now
upon

a
quarter
from

november
and
i
remained
at
aaere
these
two
days
during
which
the
sheikh
continued
his
friendly
behaviour
towards
me
it
was
my
wish
to
make
an
excursion
towards
the
western
parts
of
the
plain
of
the
haouran
in
order
to
visit
draa

ezzeroub
distant
one
day
journey
from
draa
which
judging
from
all
the
information
i
had
received
seemed
to
be
well
worth
seeing
i
offered
to
any
person
or
company
of
men
who
would
undertake
to
guide
me
to
the
spot
thirty
piastres
a
large
sum
in
these
parts
but
nobody
was
to
be
found
the
fact
was
that
the
road
from
aaere
to
draa
as
well
as
that
from
thence
to
om
edjemal
was
infested
by
a
party

chief
had
recently

besides
these
it

sheraka
made
incursions
in

thaale
was
therefore
obliged
to
give
up
my
project
but
with
the
intention
of
executing
it
at
a
future
period
november
i
left
aaere
in
the
company
of
a
druse
at
parting
the
sheikh
made
me
promise
that
i
would
again
visit
his
village
the
direction

route
was
to
the

an
hour

alighted
at

of

again
endeavoured
to
visit

but
no
body
would
undertake
to
act
as
my
guide
except
a
peasant
in
whose
company
i
did
not
think
that
i
should
be
sufficiently
secure
for
it
had
been
a
constant
rule
with
me
during
this
tour
not
to
expose
myself
to
any
hazard
well
knowing
that
this
was
not
the
place
where
duty
and
honour
obliged
me
to
do
so
on
the
contrary
i
felt
that
i
should
not
be
justified
in
risking
my
life
in
this
quarter
destined
as
i
am
to
other
and
it
is
hoped
more
important
pursuits
november
i
left
ezra
this
morning
with
the
priest
to
visit
some
villages
in
the
northern
loehf
and
if
possible
to
enter
the
ledja
we
rode
one
hour
to
keratha
close
to
which
is
a
spring
from
keratha
in
an
hour
and
a
quarter
we
came
to
mehadje
whence
i
saw
tel
shiehhan
bearing
to
the
east
of
the
road
from
ezra
to
mehadje
on
the
ledja
are
the
ruins
of
sour
and
aazim
from
mehadje
we
entered
the
ledja
and
continued
in
it
at
half
an
hour
distance
from
the
cultivated
plain
in
the
direction
till
we
reached
khabeb
arabic
at
the
end
of
two
hours
between
tebne
and
khabeb
lies
the
village
bossir
from
khabeb
the
kelab
haouran
bears
this
is
a
considerable
village
inhabited
for
the
greater
part
by
catholic
christians
who
as
i
have
mentioned
above
emigrated
from
szalkhat
the
sheikh
is
a
druse
i
met
here
a
poor
arab
a
native
of
the
country
three
days
journey
from
mekka
he
told
me
that
the
dhami
wahabi
had
killed
four
of
his
brothers
that
he
fled
from
home
and
established
himself
at
dael
a
village
in
the
haouran
which
was
ransacked
last
summer
by
the
same
enemies
when
he
lost
the
whole
of
his
property
this
man
corroborated
what
i
have
repeatedly
been
told
that
a
single
person
may
travel
over
the
wahabi
dominions
with
perfect
safety
november
i
here
took
two
druses
to
conduct
me
into
the
interior
of
the
ledja
the
arabs
who
inhabit
that
district
pay
some
deference
to
the
druses
but
none
whatever
to
the
turks
or
christians
of
the
neighbouring
villages
in
one
hour
we
passed
the
two
ruined
cities
zebair
arabic
and
zebir
arabic
close
to
each
other
at
the
end
of
two
hours
and
a
quarter
our
road
lying
in
the
direction
of
the
kelab
haouran
we
came
to
the
ruined
village
djedel
arabic
thus
far
the
ledja
is
a
level
country
with
a
stony
soil
covered
with
heaps
of
rocks
amongst
which
are
a
number
of
small
patches
of
meadow
which
afford
excellent
pasture
for
the
cattle
of
the
arabs
who
inhabit
these
parts
from
djedel
the
ground
becomes
uneven
the
pasturing
places
less
frequent
the
rocks
higher
and
the
road
more
difficult
i
had
intended
to
proceed
to
aahere
where
there
is
a
fine
spring
but
evening
coming
on
we
stopped
near
dhami
arabic
three
hours
and
three
quarters
from
khabeb
and
two
hours
distant
from
aahere
it
appears
strange
that
a
city
should
have
been
built
by
any
people
in
a
spot
where
there
is
neither
water
nor
arable
ground
and
nothing
but
a
little
grass
amidst
the
stones
dhami
may
contain
three
hundred
houses
most
of
which
are
still
in
good
preservation
there
is
a
large
building
whose
gate
is
ornamented
with
sculptured
vine
leaves
and
grapes
like
those
at
kanouat
every
house
appears
to
have
had
its
cistern
there
are
many
also
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
town
they
are
formed
by
excavations
in
the
rock
the
surface
of
which
is
supported
by
props
deir
dhami
of
loose
stones
some
of
them
are
arched
and
have
narrow
canals
to
conduct
the
water
into
them
from
the
higher
grounds
of
dhami
half
an
hour
is
deir
dhami
arabic
another
ruined
place
smaller
than
the
former
and
situated
in
a
most
dreary
part
of
the
ledja
near
which
we
found
after
a
good
deal
of
search
an
encampment
of
arabs
medledj
where
we
passed
the
night
november
these
arabs
being
of
a
doubtful
character
and
rendered
independent
by
the
very
difficult
access
of
their
rocky
abode
we
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
tell
them
that
i
had
come
to
look
at
their
country
they
were
told
therefore
that
i
was
a
manufacturer
of
gunpowder
in
search
of
saltpetre
for
at
dhami
and
in
most
of
the
ruined
villages
in
the
ledja
the
earth
which
is
dug
up
in
the
yards
of
the
houses
as
well
as
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
them
contains
saltpetre
or
as
it
is
called
in
arabic
melh
baroud
gunpowder
salt
the
ledja
which
is
from
two
to
three
days
journey
in
length
by
one
in
breadth
is
inhabited
by
several
tribes
of
arabs
viz
selman
arabic
medledj
arabic
szolout
arabic
dhouhere
arabic
and
siale
arabic
of
these
the
szolout
may
have
about
one
hundred
tents
the
medledj
one
hundred
and
twenty
and
the
others
fifty
or
sixty
they
breed
a
vast
number
of
goats
which
easily
find
pasturage
amongst
the
rocks
a
few
of
them
also
keep
sheep
and
cows
and
cultivate
the
soil
in
some
parts
of
the
ledja
where
they
sow
wheat
and
barley
they
possess
few
horses
the
medledj
have
about
twenty
and
the
szolout
and
dhouhere
each
a
dozen
but
i
shall
have
occasion
to
speak
of
these
arabs
again
in
describing
the
people
of
the
country
the
tent
in
which
we
slept
was
remarkably
large
although
it
could
not
easily
be
perceived
amidst
the
labyrinth
of
rocks
where
it
was
pitched
yet
our
host
was
kept
awake
the
whole
night
by
the
ledja
the
fear
of
robbers
and
the
dogs
barked
incessantly
he
told
me
next
morning
that
the
szolout
had
lately
been
very
successful
in
their
nightly
depredations
upon
the
medledj
our
host
having
no
barley
gave
my
horse
a
part
of
some
wheat
which
he
had
just
brought
from
the
plain
to
bake
into
bread
for
his
family
december
we
departed
at
sunrise
the
night
having
been
so
cold
that
none
of
us
was
able
to
sleep
we
found
our
way
with
great
difficulty
out
of
the
labyrinth
of
rocks
which
form
the
inner
ledja
and
through
which
the
arabs
alone
have
the
clue
some
of
the
rocks
are
twenty
feet
high
and
the
country
is
full
of
hills
and
wadys
in
the
outer
ledja
trees
are
less
frequent
than
here
where
they
grow
in
great
numbers
among
the
rocks
the
most
common
are
the
oak
the
malloula
and
the
bouttan
the
latter
is
the
bitter
almond
from
the
fruit
of
which
an
oil
is
extracted
used
by
the
people
of
the
country
to
anoint
their
temples
and
forehead
as
a
cure
for
colds
its
branches
are
in
great
demand
for
pipe
tubes
there
are
no
springs
in
any
part
of
this
stony
district
but
water
collects
in
winter
time
in
great
quantities
in
the
wadys
and
in
the
cisterns
and
birkets
which
are
every
where
met
with
in
some
of
these
it
is
kept
the
whole
summer
when
they
are
dried
up
the
arabs
approach
the
borders
of
the
ledja
called
the
loehf
to
water
their
cattle
at
the
springs
in
that
district
the
camel
is
met
with
throughout
the
ledja
and
walks
with
a
firm
step
over
the
rocky
surface
in
summer
he
feeds
on
the
flowers
or
dry
grass
of
the
pasturing
places
in
the
interior
parts
of
the
ledja
the
rocks
are
in
many
places
cleft
asunder
so
that
the
whole
hill
appears
shivered
and
in
the
act
of
falling
down
the
layers
are
generally
horizontal
from
six
to
eight
feet
or
more
in
thickness
sometimes
covering
the
hills
and
inclining
to
their
curve
as
appears
from
the
fissures
which
often
traverse
the
rock
from
top
to
bottom
in
many
places
are
ruined
walls
from
whence
it
may
be
conjectured
that
a
stratum
of
soil
of
sufficient
depth
for
cultivation
had
in
ancient
times
covered
the
rock
we
had
lost
our
road
when
we
met
with
a
travelling
encampment
of
medledj
who
guided
us
into
a
more
open
place
where
their
companions
were
pitching
their
tents
we
breakfasted
with
them
and
i
was
present
during
an
interesting
conversation
between
one
of
my
druse
companions
and
an
arab
the
wife
of
the
latter
it
appeared
had
been
carried
off
by
another
arab
who
fearing
the
vengeance
of
the
injured
husband
had
gone
to
the
druse
sheikh
of
khabeb
and
having
secured
his
dakhil
arabic
or
protection
returned
to
the
woman
in
the
ledja
the
sheikh
sent
word
to
the
husband
cautioning
him
against
taking
any
violent
measures
against
his
enemy
the
husband
whom
we
here
met
with
wished
to
persuade
the
druses
that
the
dakhil
of
the
sheikh
was
unjust
and
that
the
adulterer
ought
to
be
left
to
his
punishment
the
druse
not
agreeing
with
him
he
swore
that
nothing
should
prevent
him
from
shedding
the
blood
of
the
man
who
had
bereft
him
of
his
own
blood
but
i
was
persuaded
that
he
would
not
venture
to
carry
his
threat
into
effect
for
should
he
kill
his
enemy
the
druses
would
not
fail
to
be
revenged
upon
the
slayer
or
his
family
the
outer
ledja
is
to
be
distinguished
from
the
inner
on
this
side
as
well
as
on
that
by
which
we
entered
it
the
former
being
much
less
rocky
and
more
fit
for
pasturage
than
the
latter
on
the
borders
of
the
inner
ledja
we
passed
several
places
where
the
are
made
which
i
have
mentioned
in
a
former
part
of
my
journal
the
stones
are
cut
horizontally
out
of
the
rocks
leaving
holes
of
four
or
five
feet
in
depth
and
as
many
in
circumference
fifty
or
sixty
of
these
excavations
are
often
met
with
in
the
circumference
of
a
mile
the
stones
are
carried
to
be
finished

inhabited
by
about
one
hundred
druse

christian
families
we
travelled
this
day
about
eight
hours
and
a
half
shaara
was
once
a
considerable
city
it
is
built
on
both
sides
of
a
wady
half
an
hour
from
the
cultivated
plain
and
is
surrounded
by
a
most
dreary
barren
war
it
has
several
large
solidly
built
structures
now
in
ruins
and
amongst
others
a
tower
that
must
have
been
about
feet
high
in
the
upper
town
is
an
ancient
edifice
with
arches
converted
into
a
mosque
over
its
door
is
this
inscription

there
is
a
manufactory
in
the
town
the
earth
in
which
the
is
found
is
collected
in
great
quantities
in
the
ruined
houses
and
thrown
into
large
wooden
vessels
perforated
with
small
holes
on
one
side
near
the
bottom
water
is
then
poured
in
which
drains
through
the
holes
into
a

vessel
from
whence
it
is
taken
and
poured
into
large
copper
kettles
after
boiling
for
hours

told
by

own
account
that
he
sends
yearly
to

much
as

here
is
also
a
gunpowder
manufactory
december
the
greek
priest
who
had
not
ventured
to
accompany
me
into
the
ledja
i
found
again
at
shaara
i
wished
to
see
some
parts
of
the
northern
loehf
and
particularly
the
ruins
of
missema
of
which
i
heard
much
from
the
country
people
i
therefore
engaged
a
man
at
shaara
to
conduct
me
to
the
place
and
from
thence
to
damascus
we
set
out
in
the
morning
proceeded
along
the
limits
of
the
war
in
an
easterly
direction
and
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
came
to
the
sources
of
water
called
sheraya

they
are
five
or
six
in

situated
just
on

grow
vegetables
and
water
melons
and
in
summer
the
arabs
of
the
ledja
sometimes
sow
the
neighbouring
fields
with
wheat
but
the
frequent
passage
of
the
bedouins
renders
the
collection
of

harvest
somewhat
precarious
missemi

it
is
a
ruined

miles
in

the
principal
ruin
in

town
is
a
temple
in
tolerable
preservation
it
is
one
of
the
most
elegant
buildings
which
i
have
seen
in
the
haouran
the
approach
to
it
is
over
a
broad
paved
area
which
has
once
been
surrounded
by
a
row
of
short
pillars
a
flight
of
six
steps
the
whole
length
of
the
façade
leads
up
to
the
portico
which
consists
of
seven
doric
columns
but
of
which
three
only
are
now
standing
the
entrance
to

is
through
a
large

having
had
some
difficulty
in

in
two
hours
and
a
half
from

we
reached
the
town
of
edlip
arabic
the
approach
to
which
is
very
picturesque
it
lies
round
the
foot
of
a
hill
which
divides
it
into
two
parts
there
is
a
smaller
hill
on
the
side
the
town
is
surrounded
by
olive
plantations
and
the
whole
landscape
put
my
companion
an
english
traveller
in
mind
of
athens
and
its
vicinity
here
again
are
many
wells
cut
in
the
rocky
soil
round
the
town
this
place
is
called
little
edlip
arabic
of
great
edlip
arabic
the
name
only
remains
it
stood
at
half
an
distance
from
the
present
town
which
is
of
modern
date
or
about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
i
reckoned
the
number
of
its
houses
at
about
one
thousand
the
inhabitants
are
for
the
most
part
turks
there
are
only
eighty
greek
christian
families
and
three
of
armenian
greeks
they
have
a
church
and
three
priests
and
are
under
the
immediate
jurisdiction
of
the
greek
patriarch
of
damascus
the
principal
trade
of
edlip
is
in
soap
there
are
some
manufactories
of
cotton
stuffs
and
a
few
the
bazars
are
well
built
some
of
them
of
stone
in
the
town
are
several
khans
two
of
which
are
destined
for
the
reception
of
strangers
but
the
best
edifice
is
the
soap
manufactory
el
meszbane
a
large
building
edlip
has
no
gardens
because
there
is
no
water
but
from
wells
and
cisterns
there
are
a
few
orchards
of
pomegranate
and
fig
trees
and
some
vine
plantations
the
place
is
supplied
with
vegetables
from
rieha
and
from
aere
a
village
two
hours
distant
lying
between
darkoush
and
djissr
shogher
there
is
a
single
spring
in
the
town
of
brackish
water
which
is
never
used
but
in
seasons
of
great
drought
a
man
who
had
cleansed
the
bottom
of
the
deep
well
in
which
the
spring
issues
told
me
that
he
found
two
openings
in
the
rock
near
each
other
from
the
one
of
which
flows
sweet
water
while
that
from
the
other
is
brackish
i
made
the
tour
of
the
town
in
minutes
the
rocky
ground
is
full
of
caverns
wells
and
pits
edlip
is
held
by
the
family
of
kuperly
zaade
of
constantinople
but
a
part
of
its
revenue
is
a
wakf
to
the
harameyn
that
is
to
say
it
contributes
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
two
holy
cities
mekka
and
medina
the
town
pays
annually
to
the
above
family
twenty
purses
for
themselves
and
fifteen
for
the
holy
cities
the
latter
sum
was
formerly
sent
to
mekka
every
year
with
the
pilgrim
caravan
but
it
is
now
paid
into
the
hands
of
the
kuperlys

attached
to
the

it
pays
fifteen
purses
to

kuperlys
and
seven
to
the
harameyn
the
revenue
arising
from
thirteen
or
fourteen
villages
in
the
neighbourhood
of
djissr
shogher
has
been
assigned
to
the
support
of
several
hospitals
which
the
kuperlys
have
built
in
that
town
where
a
number
of
poor
people
are
fed
daily
gratis
neither
edlip
nor
shogher
pays
any
or
miri
in
consequence
of
their
being
attached
to
mekka
but
there
is
a
at
edlip
where
duties
are
levied
on
all
kinds
of

the
government

in
the
hands
of
a
mutsellim
named
by
the
porte
the
real
power
had
been
for
many
years
in
the
rich
family
of

arabic
till
the
present
chief
of
that
family
mahmoud
ibn
ayash
a
man
famous
for
his
hospitality
and
upright
character
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
all
his
influence
in
his
house
became
involved
in
a
deadly
quarrel
with
that
of
djahya
in
consequence
of
a
game
of
jerid
which
took
a
serious
turn
and
in
which
much
blood
was
shed
djahya
left
edlip
and
went
to
rieha
and
djissr
shogher
where
he
succeeded
in
engaging
in
his
interest
seyd
aga
and
topal
aly
the
rebel
chiefs
of
those
towns
who
only
wanted
a
pretext
to
fall
upon
edlip
they
accordingly
stirred
up
the
inhabitants
against
mahmoud
who
was
obliged
to
fly
to
aleppo
and
having
sent
the
mutsellim
moury
aga
back
to
constantinople
they
put
abou
shah
the
of
topal
aly
in
his
place
and
brought
djahya
back
to
edlip
after
some
months
the
two
rebels
came
to
a
compromise
with
mahmoud
who
returned
to
edlip
and
djahya
in
turn
fled
to
aleppo
mahmoud
power
however
was
now
at
an
end
the
two
chiefs
are
at
present
masters
of
the
town
and
share
its
spoils
but
its
wealth
has
much
decreased
since
these
events
took
place
in
eighteen
months
it
has
paid
upwards
of
six
hundred
purses
and
on
the
day
before
our
arrival
a
new
contribution
of
two
hundred
had
spread
despair
among
the
inhabitants
a

the

here
terminates
in
two
hours
and
forty
minutes
we
arrived
at

we
did
not
enter
through
fear
of
the
rebel

unless
the

finds

there
is
little
probability
of
its
reducing
them
they
at

tyrannize
over
the
whole

about
two
hours
to
the
of
rieha
lies
the
village
of
marszaf

and
of
the
latter
about
one
hour
the
ruined
town
benin
we
ascended
the
mountain
from
rieha
turned
round
its
eastern
corner
and
in
one
hour
from
rieha
reached
the
village
of
kefr
lata
arabic
we
were
hospitably
received
at
the
house
of
the
sheikh
of
kefr

although
his

only
were
at

upon
the
mountain
of

rieha
on
the
side
of
a
narrow
valley
watered
by
a
rivulet
it
contains
forty
or
fifty
houses
all
well
built
of
square
stones
which
have
been
taken
from
the
buildings
of
a
town
of
the
lower
empire
which
occupied
the
same
site
the
remains
deserve
notice
on
account
of
the
vast
quantity
of
stone
coffins
and
sepulchres
the
mountain
is
a
barren
calcareous
rock
of
no
great
hardness
in
some
places
are
a
few
spots
of
arable
ground
where
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
grow
barley
and
dhourra
on
the
side
of
the
rivulet
are
some
fruit
trees
we
were
occupied
the
whole
morning
in
visiting
the
neighbourhood
of
the
village
which
must
have
been
anciently
the
burying
place
of
all
the
great
families
of
this
district
the
number
of
tombs
being
too
considerable
for
so
small
a
town
as
kefr
lata
appears
to
have
been
no
such
sepulchres
or
at
least
very
few
are
met
with
among
the
ruins
of
the
large
cities
which
we
saw
afterwards
in
the
same
mountain
beginning
on
the
west
side
of
the
village
i
counted
sixteen
coffins
and
seven
caves
the
coffins
are
all
excavated
in
the
rock
the
largest
are
nine
feet
long
and
three
feet
and
a
half
in
breadth
the
smaller
seven
feet
long
and
three
feet
broad
their
depth
is
generally
about
five
feet
in
the
greater
part
of
them
there
is
on
one
side
a
curved
recess
cut
in
the
rock
about
four
feet
in
length
and
two
feet
in
breadth
all
these
coffins
had
originally
stone
lids
of
a
single
block
of
stone
exactly
covering
the
aperture
of
the
coffin
only
a
small
proportion
of
these
now
remain
entire
but
there
are
some
quite
uninjured
i
saw
only
two
or
three
in
which
a
sculptured
frieze
or
cornice
was
carried
along
the
whole
length
of
the
cover
the
generality
have
only
a
few
ornaments
on
the
two
ends
they
are
all
of
the
annexed
shape
the
apertures
of
the
coffins
are
invariably
even
with
the
surface
of
the
ground
and
the
lids
only
are
seen
from
without
as
if
lying
upon
the
surface
the
sepulchral
caves
vary
in
their
sizes
and
construction
the
entrance
is
generally
through
a
low
door
sometimes
ornamented
by
short
pilasters
into
a
vaulted
room
cut
in
the
rock
the
size
of
which
varies
from
six
to
fifteen
feet
in
length
and
from
four
to
ten
feet
in
breadth
the
height
of
the
vault
is
about
six
feet
but
sometimes
the
cave
terminates
in
a
flat
roof
they
all
contain
coffins
or
receptacles
for
the
dead
in
the
smaller
chambers
there
is
a
coffin
in
each
of
the
three
sides
the
larger
contain
four
or
six
coffins
two
opposite
the
entrance
and
one
on
each
side
or
two
on
each
of
the
three
sides
the
coffins
in
general
are
very
rudely
formed
some
of
the
natural
caverns
contain
also
artificial
receptacles
for
the
dead
similar
to
those
already
described
i
have
seen
many
of
these
caverns
in
different
parts
of
syria
the
south
side
of
the
village
being
less
rocky
there
are
neither
caves
nor
coffins
on
that
side
on
the
east
side
i
counted
coffins
and
five
sepulchral
caves
of
the
former
fourteen
are
within
a
very
small
space
the
greater
part
of
them
are
single
but
in
same
places
they
have
been
formed
in
pairs
upon
the
same
level
and
almost
touching
each
other
crossing
to
the
side
of
the
valley
of
kefr
lata
i
met
with
a
long
wall
built
with
large
blocks
of
stone
to
the
north
of
it
is
an
oblong
square
paces
in
length
and
in
breadth
cut
out
of
the
rock
in
its
walls
are
several
niches
in
the
middle
of
it
is
a
large
coffin
with
the
remains
of
a
wall
which
had
enclosed
it
to
the
of
this
is
a
similar
square
but
of
smaller
dimensions
i
counted
in
this
neighbourhood
twenty
coffins
and
four
sepulchral
caves
besides
several
open
niches
very
neatly
wrought
in
the
side
of
the
mountain
containing
recesses
for
the
dead
returning
towards
the
village
i
passed
the
source
of
the
rivulet
which
waters
the
valley
over
it
stands
an
ancient
building
which
consists
of
a
vaulted
roof
supported
by
four
short
columns
in
a
very
bad
heavy
style
it
is
about
thirieen
feet
in
height
a
djebel
erbayn
few
letters
of
a
greek
in
scription
are
visible
on
the
lower
part
of
the
roof
greek
we
left
the
village
about
and
crossed
the
mountain
in
a
northerly
direction
by
the
short
foot
way
to
rieha
in
half
an
hour
we
reached
the
point
of
the
mountain
directly
over
rieha
it
is
this
part
of
the
djebel
rieha
which
is
properly
called
djebel
erbayn
in
the
last
century
a
summer
residence
was
built
here
just
above
the
town
but
it
is
now
abandoned
although
a
most
beautiful
spot
surrounded
by
fruit
trees
of
all
sorts
with
a
copious
spring
and
presenting
a
magnificent
view
over
the
plains
of
aleppo
and
edlip
a
spring
which
here
issues
from
under
the
rock
collects
in
front
of
the
building
into
a
large

from
whence
it
flows
down

continued
our
road
in
a
direction
on
the
declivity
of
the
mountain
of
rieha
in
half
an
hour
el
bara
we
passed
a
copious
spring
enclosed
by
a
square
building
called
el

we
saw
the
village
kefrzebou
arabic
and
half
an
hour
to
the
west
of
it
another
called
ourim
arabic
we
met
with
several
sepulchral
caves
on
our
road
wherever
in
these
parts
the
soil
admits
of
culture
wheat
and
barley
are
sown
among
the
rocks
if
such
spots
are
distant
from
a
village
the
cultivators
pitch
a
few
tents
for
the
purpose
of
watching
the
seed
and
crop
such
encampments
are
called
mezraa
arabic
in
an
hour
and
ten
minutes
we
reached

two
hours
and
forty
minutes
the
village
meghara
arabic
with
many
remains
of
ancient
buildings
here
i
saw
a
neat
sepulchral
cave
with
a
vaulted
portico
supported
by
two
pillars
in
three
hours
we
reached
the
village
merayan
arabic
the
direction
of
our
route
sometimes
sometimes
just
by
merayan
is
a
large
coffin
cut
in
the
rocky
ground
like
those
of
kefr

a
spring
with
ancient
walls
in

twenty
minutes
we
came
to
ahsin

half
an
hour
to
the
west
of
which
is
the
village
eblim

the
principal
produce
of
all
these

is
grapes

are
carried
to
the
aleppo
market
and
there
sold
in
ordinary
years
at
about
nine
shillings
per
quintal
or
else
they
are
boiled
to
form
the
sweet
glutinous
extract
called
debs
which
is
a
substitute
for
sugar
all
over
the
east
at
the
end
of
four
hours
and
a
half
we
reached
the
village
el
bara
arabic
where
we
finished
our
day
journey
but
we
met
with
a
very
cold
reception
although
i
had
taken
the
precaution
of
obtaining
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
the

those
of

are
the
most
considerable
of
the
whole
and
as
i
had
often
heard
the
people
of
the
country
mention
them
i
thought
it
worth
while
to
take
this
circuitous
road
to
hamah
the
ruins
are
about
ten
minutes
walk
to
the
west
of
the
village
directing
our
researches
to
that
side
we
met
with
a
sepulchral
cave
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
town
a
broad
staircase
leads
down
to
the
entrance
of
it
over
which
i
copied
this
inscription
greek
the
following
figure
in
relief
was
over
it
we
saw
the
same
figure
with
variations
over
the
gates
of
several
buildings
in
these
ruins
the
episcopal
staff
is
found
in
all
of
them
the
best
executed
one
that
i
saw
was
of
this
form
on
the
outside
of
the
town
are
several
sepulchral
caves
and
a
few
coffins
the
town
walls
on
the
side
are
yet
standing
they
are
very
neatly
built
with
small
stones
with
a
square
pillar
at
every
six
or
seven
paces
about
nine
feet
high
the
ruins
extend
for
about
half
an
hour
from
south
to
north
and
consist
of
a
number
of
public
buildings
churches
and
private
habitations
the
walls
and
roofs
of
some
of
which
are
still
standing
i
found
no
inscriptions
here
the
stone
with
which
the
buildings
are
constructed
is
a
soft
calcareous
rock
that
speedily
decays
wherever
it
is
exposed
to
the
air
it
is
of
the
same
description
as
that
found
in
the
buildings
of
the
towns
about
the
mountain
of
simon
and
in
the
ruins
of
simon
where
not
a
single
legible
inscription
remains
though
as
at
bara
traces
of
them
are
seen
in
many
places
we
surveyed
the
town
in
all
directions
but
saw
no
building
worth
noticing
except
three
tombs
which
are
plain
square
structures
surmounted
with
pyramids
the
pyramidal
summit
of
one
of
them
has
fallen
the
interior
of
these
tombs
is
a
square
of
six
paces
on
the
side
opposite
the
door
is
a
stone
coffin
and
two
others
in
each
of
the
other
two
walls
the
pyramidal
roof
is
well
constructed
being
hollow
to
the
top
with
rounded
angles
and
without
any
interior
support
on
the
outside
the
pyramid
is
covered
with
thin
slabs
on
each
of
which
is
a
kind
of
knob
which
gives
the
whole
a
very
singular
appearance
the
height
of
the
whole
building
may
be
about
feet
in
one
of
the
tombs
is
a
window
the
other
is
quite
dark
two
of
them
stand
near
together
a
third
is
in
a
different
part
of
the
town
the
sides
of
one
of
the
coffins
is
carved
with
a
cross
in
the
middle
the
mode
of
construction
in
all
the
private
habitations
is
similar
to
that
which
i
noticed
in
the
ancient
towns
of
the
haouran
and
which
in
fact
is
still
in
use
in
most
of
the
arab
villages
in
syria
with
this
difference
that
the
latter
build
with
timber
and
mud
instead
of
stone
on
the
side
of
el
bara
stands
a
castle
built
in
the
saracen
or
crusade
style
with
a
spring
near
it
called
bir
alloun
arabic
the
only
one
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
ancient
town
and
which
apparently
was
insufficient
to
the
inhabitants
as
we
found
many
cisterns
cut
very
deep
in
the
rock
turning
from
the
spring
towards
the
present
village
we
passed
the
tomb
of
a
turkish
saint
called
kubbet
ibn
imaum
abou
beker
where
the
son
of
abou
beker
is
reported
to
have
been
killed
near
it
is
a
cave
with
eight
receptacles
for
the
dead
i
saw
there
some
rocks
of
the
same
basaltic
tufwacke
which
i
met
with
in
the
djebel
el
hasz
and
in
ome
of
the
districts
of
haouran
the
greater
part
of
the
villages
of
djebel
rieha
belong
to
the
dehly
bashi
at
rieha
feteyry
belongs
to
the
district
of
marra
its
inhabitants
have
often
been
punished
for
their
rebellious
conduct
and
their
predatory
incursions
into
the
neighbouring
districts
their
spirit
however
is
unbroken
and
they
still
follow
the
same
practices
the
frontiers
of
the
pashaliks
of
damascus
and
aleppo
run
across
the
mountain
of
rieha
which
commences
above
rieha
and
extends
to
kalaat
el
medyk
varying
in
breadth
from
two
to
five
hours
it
is
a
low
but
very
rocky
chain
little
fit
for
culture
except
in
the
valleys
but
it
abounds
in
game
especially
wild
boars
and
ounces
have
sometimes
been
killed
in
it
we
left
the
inhospitable
bara
at
with
two
armed
men
to
escort
us
over
the
mountain
into
the
valley
of
the
orontes
in
half
an
hour
we
passed
a
ruined
stone
bridge
across
a
narrow
wady
it
rests
upon
piers
which
are
formed
of
immense
blocks
el
ghab
of
stone
piled
upon
one
another
in
one
hour
and
twenty
minutes
we
came
to
kon
szafra
in
a
fertile
valley
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
where
a
few
families
live
in
wretched
huts
amidst
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
town
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
is
the
village
of
mezraa
in
an
hour
and
forty
minutes
we
reached
the
ruined
town
djerada
and
at
the
end
of
two
hours
and
a
half
kefr
aweyt
a
small
village
kefr
in
the
vulgar
dialect
means
ruins
here
the
mountain
is
much
less
rocky
and
more
fit
for
culture
our
road
lay
the
village
of
feteyry
lies
about
one
hour
and
a
half
south
of
aweyt
after
travelling
three
hours
we
came
in
sight
of
the
orontes
and
then
began
to
descend
the
mountain
on
this
side
is
rather
steep
and
its
side
is
overgrown
with
herbs
which
afford
an
excellent
pasturage
the
plant
asphodel
siris
arabic
is
very
common
the
inhabitants
of
syria
by
pulverising
its
dried
roots
and
mixing
the
powder
with
water
make
a
good
glue
which
is
superior
to
that
made
with
flour
as
it
is
not
attacked
by
worms
in
the
summer
the
inhabitants
of
the
valley
pasture
their
cattle
in
these
mountains
as
do
likewise
a
few
tribes
of
arabs
among
these
are
the
akeydat
of
whom
we
passed
a
small
encampment
the
part
of
djebel
rieha
which
beginning
at
kon
szafra
extends
to
the
valley
of
the
orontes
on
the
one
side
towards
kalaat
el
medyk
on
the
other
towards
djissr
shogher
bears
the
appellation
of
djebel
shaehsabou
arabic
the
continuation
of
the
same
mountain
towards
rieha
besides
its
general
name
of
djebel
rieha
is
likewise
called
djebel
zaouy
arabic
in
four
hours
and
a
quarter
we
reached
the
plain
below
near
an
insulated
hill
called
tel
aankye
arabic
which
seems
to
be
artificial
the
valley
bordered
on
the
side
by
djebel
shaehsabou
and
on
the
side
by
the
mountains
of
the
anzeyry
is
called
el
ghab
arabic
it
extends
almost
due
north
from
three
hours
of
howash
kalaat
el
medyk
to
near
djissr
shogher
its
breadth
is
about
two
hours
but
becomes
narrower
towards
the
north
it
is
watered
by
the
aaszy
arabic
or
orontes
which
flows
near
the
foot
of
the
western
mountain
where
it
forms
numerous
marshes
the
inhabitants
of
el
ghab
are
a
mongrel
race
of
arabs
and
fellahs
and
are
called
arab
el
ghab
they
live
in
winter
time
in
a
few
villages
dispersed
over
the
valley
of
which
they
cultivate
only
the
land
adjacent
to
their
villages
on
the
approach
of
hot
weather
they
retire
with
their
cattle
to
the
eastern
mountains
in
search
of
pasture
and
in
order
to
escape
the
immense
swarms
of
flies
and
gnats
arabic
which
infest
the
ghab
in
that
season
in
the
winter
the
aaszy
inundates
a
part
of
the
low
grounds
through
which
it
flows
and
leaves
many
small
lakes
and
ponds
the
valley
is
watered
also
by
numerous
springs
and
by
rivulets
which
descend
from
the
mountains
especially
from
those
on
the
east
to
the
of

having
passed
to
the

of

where
is
a
small

we
continued
our
road
up
the
valley
due
south
we
passed
near
the
spring
ayn

in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
farther
ayn
el

and
at
the
same
distance
farther
south
the
copious
spring
ayn

arabic
from
whence
we
turned
to
the
right
into
the
plain
and
at
the
end
of
four
hours
and
three
quarters
from
el
bara
reached
the
village
howash
where
we
alighted
at
the
sheikh
house
february
howash
is
the
principal
village
of
the
ghab
it
is
situated
on
the
borders
of
a
small
lake
formed
by
the
rivulet
of
ayn
el
howash
the
surrounding
country
was
at
this
time
for
the
greater
part
inundated
and
the
arabs
passed
in
small
boats
from
one
village
to
another
in
summer
the
inundation
subsides
but
the
lakes
remain
and
to
the
quantity
of
stagnant
water
thus
formed
is
owing
the
pest
of
flies
and
gnats
abovementioned
there
are
about
one
hundred
and
forty
huts
at
howash
the
walls
of
which
are
built
of
mud
the
roofs
are
composed
of
the
reeds
which
grow
on
the
banks
of
the
orontes
the
huts
in
which
these
people
live
in
the
mountain
during
the
summer
are
formed
also
of
reeds
which
are
tied
together
in
bundles
and
thus
transported
to
the
mountain
where
they
are
put
up
so
as
to
form
a
line
of
huts
in
which
the
families
within
are
separated
from
each
other
only
by
a
thin
partition
of
reeds
the
arabs
of
howash
cultivate
dhourra
and
wheat
and
like
all
the
arabs
of
the
ghab
rear
large
herds
of
buffaloes
which
are
of
a
small
kind
and
much
less
spirited
than
those
i
saw
in
the
plains
of
tarsous
it
is
a
common
saying
and
belief
among
the
turks
that
all
the
animal
kingdom
was
converted
by
their
prophet
to
the
true
faith
except
the
wild
boar
and
buffalo
which
remained
unbelievers
it
is
on
this
account
that
both
these
animals
are
often
called
christians
we
are
not
surprised
that
the
boar
should
be
so
denominated
but
as
the
flesh
of
the
buffalo
as
well
as
its
leben
or
sour
milk
is
much
esteemed
by
the
turks
it
is
difficult
to
account
for
the
disgrace
into
which
that
animal
has
fallen
among
them
the
only
reason
i
could
learn
for
it
is
that
the
buffalo
like
the
hog
has
a
habit
of
rolling
in
the
mud
and
of
plunging
into
the
muddy
ponds
in
the
summer
time
up
to
the
very
nose
which
alone
remains
visible
above
the
surface
the
territory
of
djissr
shogher
extends
as
far
as
howash
from
thence
southward
begins
the
district
of
kalaat
el
medyk
the
sheikh
of
howash
called
mohammed
el
omar
is
noted
in
the
adjoining
districts
for
his
hospitality
but
within
bthese
few
years
he
ayn
uktol
has
been
reduced
from
great
wealth
to
poverty
by
the
extortions
of
topal
aly
of
djissr
shogher
and
of
milly
ismayl
of
kalaat
el
medyk
the
troops
which
are
continually
passing
from
one
place
to
another
are
consuming
the
last
remains
of
his
property
the
night
we
slept
at
his
house
there
were
at
least
fifty
people
at
supper
of
whom
about
thirty
were
poor
arabs
of
his
village
the
others
were
all
strangers
we
left
howash
early
in
the
morning
and
rode
along
the
eastern
mountains
in
this
beautiful
valley
which
i
can
compare
only
to
the
valley
of
the
bekaa
between
the
two
libani
the
ghab
however
has
this
great
advantage
over
the
bekaa
that
it
is
copiously
watered
by
a
large
river
and
many
rivulets
while
the
latter
in
summer
time
has
little
or
no
water
at
half
an
hour
from
howash
we
met
with
several
fragments
of
shafts
of
columns
on
the
side
of
an
ancient
paved
causeway
we
followed
this
causeway
for
upwards
of
an
hour
although
in
some
places
no
remains
of
it
were
visible
at
the
distance
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
the
rate
of
about
three
miles
and
a
half
an
hour
from
the
first
heap
of
fragments
of
columns
we
met
with
a
similar
heap
then
at
an
equal
interval
a
third
and
again
a
fourth
not
more
than
four
columns
seemed
to
have
stood
together
in
any
of
these
places
we
conjectured
that
this
had
been
a
roman
road
and
the
columns
its
milliaria
the
causeway
was
traced
here
and
there
farther
to
the
south
but
without
any
appearance
of
stations
it
probably
followed
the
whole
length
of
the
valley
from
apamea
to
djissr
shogher
one
hour
and
a
quarter
from
howash
is
ayn
houyeth
arabic
a
copious
spring
the
roman
road
is
here
about
sixteen
feet
in
breadth
to
the
right
in
the
plain
is
the
village
of
houyeth
and
near
it
another
village
called
ain
uktol
arabic
on
our
right
was
a
perpendicular
rock
upon
which
were
patches
of
rich
verdure
two
hours
and
a
quarter
is
ayn
el
taka
arabic
a
large
spring
issuing
lake
el
taka
from
near
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
forming
a
small
lake
which
communicates
with
the
orontes
here
are
the
remains
of
some
ancient
walls
the
temperature
of
this
spring
as
well
as
of
those
which
we
passed
on
the
way
from
aankye
is
like
that
of
water
which
has
been
heated
by
the
sun
in
the
midst
of
summer
it
is
probably
owing
to
this
temperature
that
we
observed
such
vast
numbers
of
fish
in
the
lake
and
that
they
resort
here
in
the
winter
from
the
orontes
it
is
principally
the
species
called
by
the
arabs
the
black
fish
on
account
of
its
coloured
flesh
its
length
varies
from
five
to
eight
feet
the
fishery
is
at
present
in
the
hands
of
the
governor
of
kalaat
el
medyk
who
carries
it
on
on
his
own
account
the
period
is
from
november
till
the
beginning
of
january
the
fishermen
who
are
inhabitants
of
the
village
sherya
arabic
situated
on
the
borders
of
the
lake
at
half
an
distance
from
ayn
el
taka
enjoy
a
partial
exemption
from
the
miri
or
they
fish
with
harpoons
during
the
night
in
small
boats
which
carry
five
or
six
men
and
so
numerous
are
the
fish
that
by
throwing
the
harpoons
at
random
they
fill
their
boats
in
the
course
of
the
night
the
quantity
taken
might
be
doubled
if
there
were
a
ready
market
for
them
the
kantar
of
five
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
weight
is
sold
at
about
four
pounds
sterling
the
fish
are
salted
on
the
spot
and
carried
all
over
syria
and
to
cyprus
for
the
use
of
the
christians
during
their
long
and
rigid
fasts
the
income
derived
from
this
fishery
by
the
governor
of
kalaat
el
medyk
amounts
to
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
purses
or
three
thousand
pounds
sterling
besides
the
black
fish
carp
are
also
taken
with
nets
and
carried
to
hamah
and
homs
where
the
turks
are
very
fond
of
them
the
depth
of
the
lake
is
about
ten
feet
its
breadth
is
quite
irregular
being
seldom
more
than
half
an
hour
its
length
is
about
one
hour
and
a
half
one
hour
from
ayn
el
taka
and
the
lake
el
taka
we
arrived
at
kalaat
el
medyk
the
foot
of
the
hill
upon
which
stands
kalaat
el
medyk
arabic
or
the
castle
of
medyk
it
probably
occupies
the
site
of
apamea
for
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
travellers
have
been
wrong
in
placing
that
city
at
hamah
the
ancient
epiphania
or
at
some
ruins
situated
at
four
hours
distance
from
hamah
notwithstanding
our
desire
to
enter
the
castle
we
could
not
venture
to
do
so
the
governor
milly
ismayl
a
man
years
of
age
and
whose
name
has
been
well
known
in
syria
for
the
last
twenty
years
was
last
year
when
governor
of
hamah
ordered
by
the
pasha
of
damascus
to
march
with
his
corps
of
dehlys
towards
ladakie
to
join
the
tripoli
army
then
fighting
against
the
anzeyrys
who
inhabit
the
mountains
between
ladakie
and
antioch
in
passing
by
kalaat
el
medyk
on
his
way
to
djissr
shogher
he
found
the
castle
without
a
garrison
and
took
possession
of
it
thereby
declaring
himself
a
rebel
orders
have
in
consequence
been
given
to
strike
off
his
head
although
his
strong
fortress
enables
him
to
defy
these
orders
his
dread
of
being
surprised
induces
him
to
try
every
means
in
his
power
to
obtain
his
pardon
from
the
porte
and
he
has
even
sent
considerable
sums
of
money
to
constantinople
damascus
april
in
the
latter
end
of
march
milly
ismayl
went
to
hamah
on
some
private
business
and
during
his
absence
with
his
troops
topal
aly
quietly
seized
upon
the
castle
the
former
now
lives
in
retirement
at
hamah
while
the
power
and
reputation
of
topal
have
been
thus
considerably
increased
in
the
northern
parts
of
syria
under
these
circumstances
my
companion
and
myself
were
afraid
that
he
might
lay
hold
of
us
in
order
to
make
our
deliverance
subservient
to
his
purposes
we
therefore
passed
by
the
foot
of
the
hill
while
we
sent
in
our
attendants
to
buy
some
provisions
the
castle
is
built
upon
an
almost
insulated
hill
communicating
on
its
eastern
side
only
with
the
mountain
called
djebel
valley
of
the
orontes
oerimy
arabic
the
southernmost
point
of
djebel
shaehsabou
which
turns
off
here
towards
the
east
and
continues
for
about
three
hours
in
an
easterly
direction
to
the
south
of
oerimy
the
undulations
of
the
mountain
continue
for
about
three
hours
and
terminate
in
the
plain
of
terimsy
of
which
i
shall
speak
presently
the
castle
of
medyk
is
built
of
small
stones
with
several
turrets
and
is
evidently
of
modern
construction
on
the
side
close
to
the
gate
are
ruined
habitations
and
to
the
on
the
declivity
of
the
hill
is
a
mosque
enclosed
by
a
wall
which
forms
a
kind
of
to
the
castle
within
the
castle
wall
are
thirty
or
forty
houses
inhabited
by
turks
and
greek
christians
i
was
told
that
the
only
relic
of
antiquity
is
a
wall
in
the
governor
palace
built
with
large
blocks
of
stone
at
the
western
foot
of
the
hill
is
a
warm
sulphureous
spring
the
water
from
which
forms
a
pond
on
the
edge
of
the
pond
i
found
a
fragment
of
a
fine
fluted
doric
column
near
the
spring
is
a
large
khan
for
the
accommodation
of
travellers
on
the
side
of
the
hill
are
several
columns
scattered
about
as
we
wished
to
follow
the
valley
of
the
orontes
as
far
as
possible
we
continued
in
the
direction
by
along
the
plain
instead
of
taking
the
straight
road
towards
hamah
half
an
hour
from
kalaat
el
medyk
is
ayn
djoufar
arabic
a
rivulet
flowing
down
the
eastern
hills
through
wady
djoufar
it
runs
towards
the
castle
and
empties
itself
into
the
pond
at
the
castle
spring
up
in
the
hills
in
the
direction

quarters

rivulet
called
ayn

source
is
up

the
same
breadth
as

in
the

about
three
quarters
of

an
hour
from

a
broad
ditch
about
fifteen
feet
deep
and
forty
in

may
be
traced
for
an
hour
and
a
half
towards

orontes
near
it
is
the
village

khandak
or
the
ditch
this
ditch
is
not
paved
and
may
formerly
have
served
for
the
irrigation
of
the
plain
after
proceeding
for
two
hours
from
the
castle
our
two
guides
refused
to
go
any
farther
insisting
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
continue
longer
in
the
valley
to
say
the
truth
it
was
in
many
parts
covered
with
water
or
deep
mud
for
the
rains
had
been
incessant
during
several
months
and
the
road
we
had
already
come
from
the
castle
was
with
difficulty
passable
we
were
therefore
obliged
to
yield
and
turning
to
our
left
a
little
way
up
the
hill
rested
at
the
village
of
sekeylebye
arabic
situated
on
one
of
the
low
hills
near
a
rivulet
called
wady

may
here
observe
that

its

the

of
the
lake
diminishes
considerably
in
the
summer
time
but
very
seldom
dries
up
entirely
the
only
instance
upon
record
was
during
the
great
drought
in
when
it
is
asserted
that
springs
were
discovered
in
the
bed
of
the
lake
i
am
not
quite
certain
whether
it
communicates
on
the
western
side
with
the
orontes
our
guides
were
not
unanimous
in
their
answers
the
river
however
must
at
least
pass
very
close
to
the
lake
on
the
southern
borders
of
the
lake
are
the
tels
or
mounds
of
earth
called
telloul
el

arabic
on
the
side
is
the
tel
waoyat
arabic
the
soil
in
the
vicinity
of
the
lake
is
a
soft
clay
and
i
had
great
seidjar
difficulty
in
extricating
my
mare
from
the
swamp
as
i
approached
to
reconnoitre
the
lake
which
our
company
had
left
to
the
right
of
the
road
in
the
spring
the
earth
hardens
and
is
then
covered
with
most
luxuriant
pasturage
in
march
the
peasants
and
arabs
of
all
the
neighbouring
districts
and
villages
as
well
as
the
inhabitants
of
hamah
send
their
horses
and
mules
here
to
graze
under
the
care
of
herdsmen
who
regularly
pitch
their
tents
near
the
waoyat
and
each
of
whom
receives
a
piastre
a
head
from
the
owners
the
cattle
remain
here
till
april
the
best
pasture
seems
to
be
on
the
and
sides
the
banks
of
the
lake
being
there
lower
than
on
the
opposite
sides
it
was
here
perhaps
that
the
seleucidae
fed
their
herds
of
elephants
two
hours
and
a

from

is

three
hours
and
a
half
slow
march
we
reached
the
orontes
near
a
spot
where
a
large
wheel
of
the
same
construction
as
those
at
hamah
raises
the
water
from
the
river
and
empties
it
into
a
stone
canal
by
means
of
which
the
neighbouring
fields
are
irrigated
at
the
end
of
four
hours
we
came
to
a
bridge
over
the
river
on
the
other
side
of
which
the
castle
of
seidjar
is
arabic
situated
if
i
recollect
rightly
the
bridge
rests
upon
thirteen
arches
it
is
well
built
but
of
modern
construction
it
is
placed
at
the
point
where
the
aaszy
issues
from
between
rugged
mountains
on
the
summit
of
the
range
on
the
left
bank
stands
the
castle
to
the
of

at

it
is
nearly
as
large
as

just
by
the
bridge
is
a
khan
of
ancient
construction
probably
of
the
period
of
the
crusades
a
paved
way
leads
up
to
the
castle
which
is
at
present
inhabited
by
a
few
hundred
families
of
peasants
it
appears
from
the
style
of
construction
that
the
castle
as
it
now
stands
is
of
the
time
of
the
latter
califes
the
walls
towers
and
turrets
which
surround
it
on
the
and
sides
are
evidently
saracen
but
it
should
seem
from
the
many
remains
of
grecian
architecture
found
in
the
castle
that
a
greek
town
formerly
stood
here
fragments
of
columns
and
elegant
corinthian
and
doric
capitals
lie
dispersed
about
it
amongst
them
is
a
coffin
of
fine
marble
nine
feet
long
but
i
could
find
no
remains
of
any
ancient
building
on
the
east
side
the
river
runs
at
the
foot
of
a
deep
precipice
in
the
south
wall
a
strong
well
built
tower
is
still
in
perfect
preservation
near
it
is
a
deep
well
and
a
subterraneous
passage
which
we
were
informed
leads
down
to
the
river
side
we
searched
in
vain
for
greek
inscriptions
on
the
above
mentioned
tower
is
a
fine
arabic
inscription
but
too
high
to
be
copied
by
such
sighted
people
as
we
both
happened
to
be
on
the
gate
of
the
castle
which
leads
through
an
arched
passage
into
the
interior
i
copied
the
following
in
which
many
foreign
words
are
mixed
with
the
arabic
arabic
part
of
the
declivity
of

which
indicate
the
site
of
a

several
fragments
of

and
a
great
deal
of

are
lying

we
dug
up
an

neighbourhood
of
seidjar
is
calcareous
of
considerable
hardness
and
of
a
reddish
yellow
colour
on
the
side
of
the
castle
the
rock
seems
to
have
been
cut
perpendicularly
down
almost
as
low
as
the
river
either
for
the
purpose
of
adding
to
the
defence
of
the
fortress
on
this
side
or
to
facilitate
the
drawing
up
of
water
from
the
river
we
now
crossed
the
low
hills
to
the
south
of
seidjar
and
entered
the
plain
of
hamah
which
is
very
little
cultivated
here
we
proceeded
in
a
direction
in
one
hour
and
a
half
from

we
passed
a
number
of
wells
cut
close
to
each

rocky
ground

one
hour
and
three
quarters
is
a
small
bridge
over
a
torrent
called
el
saroudj
arabic
which
empties
itself
into
the
orontes
in
two
hours
we
saw
to
our
left
about
half
an
hour
distant
the
village

on
the
right
bank
of
the

in
two
hours
and
three
quarters
a
small

we
passed
the

a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
near
it
the
village
el

the
fertile
soil
now
begins
to
be
well
cultivated
in
four
hours
we
reached

where
we
alighted
at
the
house
of
selym
keblan
one
of
the
secretaries
the
most
gentlemanly
levantine
i
had
yet
known
hamah
is
situated
on
both
sides
of
the
orontes
a
part
of
it
is
built
on
the
declivity
of
a
hill

a
part
in

medine
is
the
abode
of

the
town
is
of
considerable
extent
and
must
contain
at
least
thirty
thousand
inhabitants
of
whom
the
greek
families
according
to
the
bishop
information
are
about
three
hundred
in
the
middle
of
the
city
is
a
square
mound
of
earth
upon
which
the
castle
formerly
stood
the
materials
as
well
as
the
stones
with
which
it
is
probable
that
the
hill
was
faced
have
been
carried
away
and
used
in
the
erection
of
modern
buildings
there
are
four
bridges
over
the
orontes

the
upper

with
water
by

of
buckets
fixed
to

which
empty
themselves
into
stone
canals
supported
by
lofty
arches
on
a

there
are
about
a
dozen
of
the
wheels
the
largest
of
them
called
naoura
el

is
at
least
seventy
feet
in
diameter
the
town
for
the
greater
part
is
well
built
although
the
walls
of
the
dwellings
a
few
palaces
excepted
are
of
mud
but
their
interior
makes
amends
for
the
roughness
of
their
external
appearance
the
mutsellim
resides
in
a
seraglio
on
the
banks
of
the
river
i
enquired
in
vain
for
a
piece
of
marble
with
figures
in
relief
which
la
roque
saw
but
in
the
corner
of
a
house
in
the
bazar
is
a
stone
with
a
number
of
small
figures
and
signs
which
appears
to
be
a
kind
of
hieroglyphical
writing
though
it
does
not
resemble
that
of
egypt
i
counted
thirteen
mosques
in
the
town
the
largest
of
which
has
a
very
ancient
minaret
the
principal
trade
of

is
with
the
arabs
who
buy
here
their
tent
furniture
and
clothes
the
abbas
or
woollen
mantles
made
here
are
much
esteemed
hamah
forms
a
part

is
usually
the
station

four
hundred

kept
here
by

to
check
the
arabs
who
inundate
the

and
summer
few
rich
merchants
are
found
in
the

it
is
the
residence
of
many
opulent
turkish
gentlemen
who
find
in
it
all
the
luxuries
of
the
large

some
measure
removed

for
his
brave
defence
of
cairo
after
the
defeat
of

being
curious
to
see
him
i
waited
upon
him
notwithstanding
the
rule
i
had
prescribed
to
myself
of
mixing
as
little
as
possible
with
turkish
grandees
and
presented
him
a
letter
of
recommendation
we
conversed
for
about
half
an
hour
he
was
very
civil
for
a
pasha

made
many
enquiries
concerning

of
its
territory

the
granary
of
northern

though
the
harvest
never
yields
more
than
ten
for

chiefly
in
consequence
of
the
immense
numbers
of
mice
which
sometimes
wholly
destroy
the
crops
i
did
not
see
any
of
these
animals
from
a
point
on

the

clear
february
we
remained
five
days
in
the
hospitable
house
of
selym
where
a
large
company
of
turks
and
arabs
assembled
every
evening
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
we
could
prevail
upon
him
to
let
us
depart
the
distance
between
hamah
and
tripoli
by
the
direct
road
is
four
days
or
three
days
by
performing
on
the
first
a
thirteen
hours
journey
from
hamah
to
hossn
but
we
wished
to
visit
the
castle
of
maszyad
the
seat
of
the
ismaylys
which
is
laid
down
upon
most
of
the
maps
of
syria
but
has
rarely
been
visited
by
any
travellers
we
set
out
about
and
travelling
in
a
shyghata
direction
came
in
an
hour
and
a
half
to
the
christian
village
kefrbehoun
arabic
and
in
two
hours
to
a
hillock
in
the
plain
called
tel
afyoun
arabic
the
with
an
ancient
well
the
number
of
these
insulated
mounds
of
earth
in
the
eastern
plain
of
syria
is
very
remarkable
their
shape
is
sometimes
so
regular
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
their
being
artificial
in
several
places
there
are
two
standing
close
together
it
is
a
general
remark
that
wherever
there
is
such
a
mound
a
village
is
found
near
it
and
a
spring
or
at
least
an
ancient
well
at
two
hours
and
a
half
from
hamah
is
el

a
small
village
near
the
road
here
the
ground
begins
to
be
uneven
covered
with

the
ruins
of
a
considerable

from
hence

homs
in
four
hours
and
a
half
we
came
to
considerable
heaps
of
large
hewn
stones
and
ruined
habitations
called
el
feiryouny
arabic
where
a
few
families
of
kurdines
had
pitched
their
tents
on
the
side
of
the

is
a
large
and
very
neatly
cut
ancient
well
the
face
of
the
country
is
hilly
with
a
rocky
soil
here
and
there
cultivated
at
the
end
of
five
hours
and
a
half
we
reached
byszyn
arabic
a
village
inhabited
by
anzeyrys
where
we
slept
february
one
hour
and
a
half
from
byszyn
is
the
village
of
shyghata
arabic
the
road
ascends
through
a
rocky
country
overgrown
with
shrubs
and
low
trees
at
two
hours
and
a
half
is
a
ruined
bridge
over
the
winter
torrent
el
saroudj
which
we
had
passed
in
the
plain
below
between
seidjar
and
hamah
it
was
now
so
much
swelled
by
the
heavy
rains
that
we
were
trying
in
vain
to
cross
it
in
different
places
when
a
shepherd
came
to
our
assistance
and
shewed
us
a
ford
considerable
as
the
stream
was
it
is
dried
up
in
summer
we
proceeded
from
the
bridge
in
a
direction
and
after
a
march
of
an
hour
and
three
quarters
during
which
we
crossed
several
torrents
we
reached
the
castle
of
maszyad
arabic
or
as
it
is
written
in
the
books
of
the
miri
meszyaf
arabic
the
approach
to
the
castle
on
two
sides
is
across
a
large
moor
to
the
of
it
are
the
highest
points
of
the
mountain
of
maszyad
at
the
foot
of
which
it
stands
upon
a
high
and
almost
perpendicular
rock
commanding
the
wild
moor
in
every
direction
and
presenting
a
gloomy
romantic
landscape
on
the
side
is
a
valley
where
the
inhabitants
cultivate
wheat
and
barley
the
town
of
maszyad
is
built
between
the
castle
and
the
mountain
on
the
declivity
of
the
mountain
it
is
upwards
of
half
an
hour
in
circumference
but
the
houses
are
in
ruins
and
there
is
not
a
single
well
built
dwelling
in
the
town
although
stone
is
the
only
material
used
the
town
is
surrounded
by
a
modern
wall
and
has
three
stone
gates
of
more
ancient
construction
on
one
of
them
i
saw
the
following
inscription
arabic
the
last
line
as
i
was
told
by
a
man
of
tripoli
contains
the
names
of
some
of
the
deities
of
the
ismaylys
the
mosque
is
now
in
ruins
there
are
several
arabic
inscriptions
in
different
parts
of
the
town
which
are
all
of
the
time
of
el
melek
el
dhaher
arabic
the
castle
is
surrounded
by
a
wall
of
moderate
thickness
and
contains
a
few
private

of
the
mamlouk
kosta
on
the
top
of
the
rock
are
some
apartments
belonging
to
the
castle
which
appear
to
have
had
several
floors
from
a
kyosk
which
the
present
governor
has
built
here
there
is
a
beautiful
view
down
into
the
western
valley
maszyad
is
remarkable
from
being
the
chief
seat
of
the
religious
sect
called
ismayly
arabic
enquiries
have
often
been
made
concerning
the
religious
doctrines
of
this
sect
as
well
as
those
of
the
anzeyrys
and
druses
not
only
european
travellers
and
europeans
resident
in
syria
but
many
natives
of
influence
have
endeavoured
to
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
these
idolaters
without
success
and
several
causes
combine
to
make
it
probable
that
their
doctrines
will
long
remain
unknown
the
principal
reason
is
that
few
individuals
among
them
become
acquainted
with
the
most
important
and
secret
tenets
of
their
faith
the
generality
contenting
themselves
with
the
observance
of
some
exterior
practices
while
the
arcana
are
possessed
by
the
select
few
it
will
be
asked
perhaps
whether
their
religious
books
would
not
unveil
the
mystery
it
is
true
that
all
the
different
sects
possess
books
which
they
regard
as
sacred
but
they
are
intelligible
only
to
the
initiated
a
sacred
book
of
the
anzeyrys
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
chief
of
the
army
of
youssef
pasha
which
plundered
the
castles
of
that
sect
in
it
came
afterwards
into
the
possession
of
my
friend
selym
of
hamah
who
had
destined
it
as
a
present
to
me
but
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
part
with
it
to
a
travelling
physician
and
the
book
is
now
in
the
possession
of
rousseau
the
french
consul
at
aleppo
who
has
had
it
translated
into
french
and
means
to
publish
it
but
it
will
probably
throw
little
light
upon
the
question
another
difficulty
arises
from
the
extreme
caution
of
the
ismaylys
upon
this
subject
whenever
they
are
obliged
to
visit
any
part
of
the
country
under
the
turkish
government
they
assume
the
character
of
mussulmans
being
well
aware
that
if
they
should
be
detected
in
the
practice
of
any
rite
contrary
to
the
turkish
religion
their
hypocrisy
in
affecting
to
follow
the
latter
would
no
longer
be
toleraled
and
their
being
once
clearly
known
to
be
pagans
which
they
are
only
suspected
to
be
at
present
would
expose
them
to
the
heaviest
exactions
and
might
even
be
followed
by
their
total
expulsion
or
extirpation
christians
and
jews
are
tolerated
because
mohammed
and
his
immediate
successors
granted
them
protection
and
because
the
turks
acknowledge
christ
and
the
prophets
but
there
is
no
instance
whatever
of
pagans
being
tolerated
the
ismaylys
are
generally
reported
to
adore
the
pudendum
muliebre
and
to
mix
on
certain
days
of
the
year
in
promiscuous
debauchery
when
they
go
to
hamah
they
pray
in
the
mosque
which
they
never
do
at
kalaat
maszyad
this
castle
has
been
from
ancient
times
their
chief
seat
one
of
them
asserted
that
his
religion
descended
from
ismayl
the
son
of
abraham
and
that
the
ismaylys
had
been
possessed
of
the
castle
since
the
time
of
el
melek
el
dhaher
as
acknowledged
by
the
firmahns
of
the
porte
a
few
years
since
they
were
driven
out
of
it
by
the
anzeyrys
in
consequence
of
a
most
daring
act
of
treachery
the
anzeyrys
and
ismaylys
have
always
been
at
enmity
the
consequence
perhaps
of
some
religious
differences
in
a
tribe
of
the
former
having
quarrelled
with
their
chief
quitted
their
abode
in
their
mountains
and
applied
to
the
emir
of
maszyad
for
an
asylum
the
latter
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
divide
the
strength
of
his
enemies
readily
granted
the
request
and
about
three
hundred
with
their
sheikh
mahmoud
settled
at
maszyad
the
emir
carrying
his
hospitality
so
far
as
to
order
several
families
to
quit
the
place
for
the
purpose
of
affording
room
for
the
new
settlers
for
several
months
all
was
tranquil
till
one
day
when
the
greater
part
of
the
people
were
at
work
in
the
fields
the
anzeyrys
at
a
given
signal
killed
the
emir
and
his
son
in
the
castle
and
then
fell
upon
the
ismaylys
who
had
remained
in
their
houses
sparing
no
one
they
could
find
and
plundering
at
the
same
time
the
whole
town
on
the
following
day
the
anzeyrys
were
joined
by
great
numbers
of
their
countrymen
which
proved
that
their
pretended
emigration
had
been
a
plot
and
the
circumstance
of
its
being
kept
secret
for
three
months
by
so
great
a
number
of
them
serves
to
shew
the
character
of
the
people
about
three
hundred
ismaylys
perished
on
this
occasion
the
families
who
had
escaped
in
the
sack
of
the
town
fled
to
hamah
homs
and
tripoli
and
their
treacherous
enemies
successfully
attacked
three
other
ismayly
castles
in
the
mountain
the
ismaylys
then
implored
the
protection
of
youssef
pasha
at
that
time
governor
of
damascus
who
marched
with
four
or
five
thousand
men
against
the
anzeyrys
retook
the
castles
which
had
belonged
to
the
ismaylys
but
kept
the
whole
of
the
plunder
of
the
anzeyrys
to
himself
this
castle
of
maszyad
with
a
garrison
of
forty
men
resisted
his
whole
army
for
three
months
in
after
youssef
pasha
had
been
exiled
by
the
porte
the
ismaylys
who
had
fled
to
hamah
homs
and
tripoli
returned
and
maszyad
is
now
inhabited
by
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
ismayly
families
and
by
thirty
of
christians
the
chief
who
resides
in
the
castle
is
styled
emir
his
name
is
zogheby
arabic
of
the
family
of
soleiman
he
informed
me
that
his
family
had
been
possessors
of
the
emirship
from
remote
times
and
that
they
are
recognised
as
such
by
express
firmahns
from
the
porte
zogherby
is
a
nephew
of
mustafa
the
emir

was
slain
by

anzeyrys
some
of
his

in
the
ismayly
castles
of
el
kadmous
el
kohf
el
aleyka
and
el
merkah
in
the
mountains
towards
ladakie
after
what
has
lately
taken
place
it
extreme
they
are
apparently
at
peace
but
many
secret
murders
are
committed
do
you
suppose
said
a
handsome
young
man
to
me
while
his
eyes
flashed
with
anger
that
these
whiskers
shall
turn
gray
before
i
shall
have
taken
my
revenge
for
a
slaughtered
wife
and
two
infant
children
but
the
ismaylys
are
weak
i
do
not
think
that
they
can
muster
eight
hundred
while
the
anzeyrys
are
triple
that
number
the
principal
produce
of
the
neighbourhood
of
maszyad
is
silk
they
have
large
plantations
of
mulberry
trees
which
are
watered
by
numerous
rivulets
descending
on
all
sides
from
the
mountain
into
the
valley
and
as
few
of
them
dry
up
in
summer
this
must
be
a
delightful
residence
during
the
hot
season
there
are
three
or
four
ismayly
villages
in
the
neighbourhood
of
maszyad
from
the
castle
the
ruins
called
deir
szoleib
bear
distant
about
two
hours
and
a
half
i
was
told
that
there
are
large
buildings
at
that
place
constructed
with
immense
blocks
of
stone
and
bearing
infidel
inscriptions
but
the
natives
of
these
countries
are
unable
to
distinguish
sculptured
ornaments
from
letters
in
unknown
languages
and
travellers
are
often
deceived
by
reports
of
long
inscriptions
which
prove
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
few
decorations
of
architecture
february
having
been
disappointed
in
our
hopes
of
finding
any
thing
remarkable
at
kalaat
el
maszyad
we
directed
our
course
to
tripoli
we
began
to
fear
that
the
incessant
rains
would
make
the
torrents
impassable
particularly
the
saroudj
which
we
crossed
yesterday
the
emir
gave
us
one
of
his
men
to
guide
and
protect
us
through
his
territories
after
travelling
for
an
hour
and
a
half
across
the
moor
along
the
side
of
the
upper
ridge
of
the
mountains
of
maszyad
we
arrived
at
the
village

near
to
which
is
the

there
are
several
other
ruined
castles
in
this
district
which
appear
to
have
been
all
built
about
the
twelfth
century
at
two
hours
and
a
half
is

a

summit
of
a

of

one
hour
is
the
ruined
castle
barein

near
beyadhein
we
crossed
the
torrent
saroudj
a
second
time
its
different
branches
inundated
the
whole
plain
two
hours
and
a
half
is
the
village
kortouman
arabic
inhabited
by
turkmans
from
whence
maszyad
bears
by
here
we
passed
another
torrent
near
a
mill
and
in
a
storm
of
heavy
rain
and
thunder
reached
nyszaf
three
hours
and
three
quarters
from
maszyad
the
road
from
kortouman
lying
by
for
the
greater
part
in

declivity
of
which
it
is
built
is
peopled
by
turkmans
the
greater
part
of
whom
do
not
speak
arabic
we
dried
our
clothes
at
a
fire
in
the
sheikh
house
and
took
some
refreshment
we
then
ascended
the
mountain
to
the
of
the
village
and
my
guides
who
were
afraid
of
the
road
through
the
upper
part
of
the
mountain
refusing
to
proceed
we
halted
for
the
night
at
shennyn
arabic
an
anzeyry
village
halfway
up
the
mountain
the
declivity
of
the
mountain
is
covered
with
vineyards
growing
upon
narrow
terraces
constructed
to
prevent
the
rain
from
washing
away
the
soil
from
the
grapes
is
extracted
the
debs
which
they
sell
at
hamah
three
quintals
of
grapes
are
shennyn
necessary
to
make
one
quintal
of
debs
which
was
sold
last
year
at
the
rate
of
per
quintal
as
our
hosts
appeared
to
be
good
natured
people
i
entered
after
supper
into
conversation
with
them
with
a
view
to
obtain
some
information
upon
their
religious
tenets
but
they
were
extremely
reserved
upon
this
head
i
had
heard
that
the
anzeyrys
maintained
from
time
to
time
some
communication
with
the
east
indies
and
that
there
was
a
temple
there
belonging
to
their
sect
to
which
they
occasionally
sent
messengers
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
i
said
that
i
knew
there
were
some
anzeyrys
in
the
east
indies
they
were
greatly
amazed
at
this
and
enquired
how
i
had
obtained
my
information
and
their
countenances
seemed
to
indicate
that
there
was
some
truth
in
my
assertion
they
are
divided
into
different
sects
of
which
nothing
is
known
except
the
names
viz
kelbye
shamsye
and
mokladjye
some
are
said
to
adore
the
sun
and
the
stars
and
others
the
pudendum
muliebre
the
mokledjye
wear
in
their
girdle
a
small
iron
hook
which
they
use
when
making
water
it
is
also
said
that
they
prostrate
themselves
every
morning
before
their
naked
mothers
saying
arabic
and
it
is
asserted
that
they
have
a
promiscuous
intercourse
with
their
females
in
a
dark
apartment
every
friday
night
but
these
are
mere
reports
it
is
a
fact
however
that
they
entertain
the
curious
belief
that
the
soul
ought
to
quit
the
dying
person
body
by
the
mouth
and
they
are
extremely
cautious
against
any
accident
which
they
imagine
may
prevent
it
from
taking
that
road
for
this
reason
whenever
the
government
of
ladakie
or
tripoli
condemns
an
anzeyry
to
death
his
relations
offer
considerable
sums
that
he
may
be
empaled
instead
of
hanged
i
can
vouch
for
the
truth
of
this
belief
which
proves
at
least
that
they
have
some
idea
of
a
future
state
it
appears
that
wady
rowyd
there
are
anzeyrys
in
anatolia
and
at
constantinople
some
years
since
a
great
man
of
this
sect
died
in
the
mountain
of
antioch
and
the
water
with
which
his
corpse
had
been
washed
was
carefully
put
into
bottles
and
sent
to
constantinople
and
asia
minor
march
the
weather
having
cleared
up
a
little
we
set
out
early
and
in
an
hour
and
a
half
reached
the
top
of
the

from
whence
we
enjoyed
a
beautiful
view
to

half
an

the
summit
on

western
declivity
is
the
copious
spring
called
near

in
two
hours
we
came

now
descended
into
the
romantic

full
of
mulberry

with
a
torrent
rolling
in
the
bottom
of

three
quarters
is
the

on

and
one
hour
farther
to
the
of
the
latter
on
the
same
side
is
the
village
el

we
crossed
the
wady
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
continued
along
its
right
bank
on
the
slope
of
the
mountain
through
orchards
and
fields
till
we
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
upon
which
kalaat

is
built
our
horses
being
rather
fatigued
we
sent
them
on
to
deir
djordjos
the
convent
of
george
where
we
intended
lalaat
el
hossn
to
sleep
and
walked
up
to
the
castle
which
is
distant
six
hours
and
a
half
from
shennyn
it
is
built
upon
the
top
of
an
insulated
hill
which
communicates
on
its
western
side
only
with
the
chain
of
mountains
we
had
passed
below
the
walls
of
the
castle
on
the
east
side
is
the
town
of
hossn
consisting
of
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
houses
the
castle
is
one
of
the
finest
buildings
of
the
middle
age
i
ever
saw
it
is
evidently
of
european
construction
the
lions
which
are
carved
over
the
gate
were
the
armorial
bearings
of
the
counts
of
thoulouse
whose
name
is
often
mentioned
in
the
history
of
the
crusades
it
is
surrounded
by
a
deep
paved
ditch
on
the
outside
of
which
runs
a
wall
flanked
with
bastions
and
towers
the
walls
of
the
castle
itself
are
very
regularly
constructed
and
are
ornamented
in
many
places
with
high
gothic
arches
projecting
several
feet
from
the
wall
the
inner
castle
which
is
seventy
paces
in
breadth
and
one
hundred
and
twenty
in
length
is
defended
by
bastions
a
broad
staircase
under
a
lofty
arched
passage
leads
up
from
the
gate
into
the
castle
and
was
accessible
to
horsemen
in
the
interior
we
particularly
admired
a
large
saloon
of
the
best
gothic
architecture
with
arches
intersecting
each
on
the
roof
in
the
middle
of
a
we
noticed
a
round
pavement
of
stones
elevated
about
a
foot
and
a
half
above
the
ground
and
eighteen
paces
in
diameter
we
could
not
account

a

near

is
said
to
flow
only
at
intervals
of
two

three
days
the

told
me
that
the
convent
was
built
at
the

time
with
the
castle
of
hossn
we
left
mar
djordjos
in
a
heavy
rain
descended
into
the
wady
mar
djordjos
and
after
two
hours
slight
descent
reached
the
plain
near
a
spring
called
neba
el
khalife
arabic
round
which
are
some
ancient
walls
a
vast
plain
now
opened
before
us
bordered
on
the
west
by
the
sea
which
however
was
not
yet
distinguishable
on
the
by
the
mountains
of
tartous
on
the
by
the
anzeyrys
mountains
and
on
the
south
by
the
djebel
shara
arabic
which
is
the
lower
northern
continuation
of
the
djebel
libnan
and
djebel
akkar
to
the
right
distant
about
three
hours
we
saw
the
castle
of
szaffytta
arabic
the
principal
seat
of
the
anzeyry
where
their
chief
el
fakker
resides
it
is
situated
on
the
declivity
of
the
anzeyry
mountains
near
it
stands
an
ancient
tower
called
berdj
mar
mykhael
or
michael
tower
about
seven
hours
from
szaffytta
towards
kalaat
maszyadt
are
the
ruins
of
a
temple
now
called
hassn
soleiman
which
according
to
all
reports
is
very
deserving
of
the
traveller
notice
as
indeed
are
all
the
mountains
of
szaffytta
and
the
whole
anzeyry
territory
where
are
the
castles
of
merkab
khowabe
kadmous
el
aleyka
el
kohf
berdj
tokhle
yahmour
berdj
miar
areyme
and
several
others
it
would
take
ten
days
to
visit
these
places
we
continued
along
the
foot
of
the
hills
which
form
the
djebel
shara
they
are
inhabited
by
turkmans
and
kurdines
we
passed
several
torrents
and
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
through
the
swampy
soil
after
a
march
of
five
hours
and
a
half
we
came
to
a
rivulet
which
had
swollen
so
much
from
the
rain
of
last
night
and
this
day
that
we
could
not
venture
to
pass
it
we
found
several
peasants
who
were
as
anxious
to
cross
it
as
ourselves
but
who
could
not
get
their
mules
over
as
the
rain
had
ceased
we
waited
on
the
banks
for
the
decrease
of
the
waters
which
is
usually
as
rapid
as
their
rise
but
it
soon
appeared
that
the
rain
still
continued
to
fall
in
the
mountains
for
the
stream
instead
of
decreasing
became
much
larger
in
this
difficulty
we
had
to
choose
between
returning
to
the
convent
and
sleeping
in
the
open
air
on
the
banks
of
the
rivulet
we
preferred
the
latter
and
passed
an
uncomfortable
night
on
the
wet
ground
by
daylight
the
waters
had
so
far
decreased
that
we
passed
over
without
any
accident
march
on
the
opposile
side
we
met
with
another
and
larger
branch
of
the
same
stream
and
at
the
end
of
an
hour
and
a
quarter
reached
the
nahr
el
kebir
the
ancient
eleutherus
near
a
ruined
bridge
this
is
a
large
torrent
dangerous
at
this
period
of
the
year
from
its
rapidity
the
hamah
caravans
have
been
known
to
remain
encamped
on
its
banks
for
weeks
together
without
being
able
to
cross
it
on
the
opposite
side
stands
a
khan
called
ayash
with
the
tomb
of
the
saint
sheikh
ayash
arabic
tel
arka
which
is
usually
the
third
day
station
of
the
caravans
from
hamah
to
tripoli
having
crossed
the
river
we
followed
the
northern
swellings
of
the
mountain
akkar
in
a
direction
having
the
plain
all
the
way
on
our
right
in
one
hour
and
a
quarter
from
the
khan
we
passed
at
half
an
hour
distance
to
the
an
insulated
hillock
in
the
plain
on
which
are
some
ruined
buildings
called
kella
arabic
and
to
the
east
of
it
half
an
hour
another
hillock
called
tel
aarous
arabic
and
at
the
same
distance
of
the
latter
the
village
haytha
arabic
at
two
hours
and
a
quarter
from
the
khan
ayash
we
passed
the
torrent
khereybe
coming
down
the
wady
of
that
name
on
our
left
and
the
castle
and
village
khereybe

the
mosque
near
to
it
and
where
the
mountains
runs
out
in
a
point
towards
the
north
is
a
hill
called
tel
arka
which
appears
by
its
regularly
flattened
conical
form
and
smooth
sides
to
be
artificial
i
was
told
that
on
its
top
are
some
ruins
of
habitations
and
walls
upon
an
elevation
on
its
and
sides
which
commands
a
beautiful
view
over
the

large
and
extensive
heaps
of
rubbish

of
ancient
dwellings

of
hewn

fragments
of

columns
of
the

i
counted
eight
six
of
which
were
of
gray
and
the
other
two
of
fine
red
granite
here
then
must
have
stood
the
ancient
town
of

where
alexander
severus
was
born
the
hill

probably
the
citadel
or
a
temple

have
stood
on

the
west
side
of
the
hill
runs
the
deep
valley

with
a
torrent
of
the

name
which
we
passed
over
a
bridge
near
a
mill

road
continued
from
an
elevated
spot
at
four

far
as

we
now
turned
round
the
mountains
on

and
passed
several
tents
of
turkmans
five
hours
and
a

in

we
arrived
at

and
alighted
at
the

of
the

agent
catziflis
this
city
which
is
called
tarabolos
by
the

the

opposite
to
it
on

the
castle
built
in
the
time
of
the
crusades
this
castle
has
often
been
in
a
ruined
state
but
it
has
lately
been
put
into
complete
repair
by

many
parts
of
tripoli
bear
marks
of
the
ages
of

amongst
these
are
several
high
arcades
of
gothic
architecture
under
which
the
streets
run
in
general
the
town
is
well
built
and
is
much
embellished
by
the
gardens
which
are
not
only
attached
to
the
houses
in
the
town
but
cover
likewise
the
whole
triangular
plain
lying
between
it
and
the
sea
tripoli
stands
in
one
of
the
most
favoured
spots
in
all
syria
as
the
maritime
plain
and
neighbouring
mountains
place
every
variety
of
climate
within
a
short
distance
of
the
inhabitants
the
wady
kadisha
higher
up
than
tripoli
is
one
of
the
most
picturesque
valleys
i
ever
saw
at
half
an
hour
from
the
town
is
an
aqueduct
across
the
wady
built
upon
arches
the
natives
call
it
kontaret
el
brins
arabic
a
corruption
perhaps
of
prince
it
conveys
the
water
used
for
drinking
into
the
town
by
means
of
a
canal
along
the
left
bank
of
the
kadisha
a
few
yards
above
the
aqueduct
is
a
bridge
across
the
stream
i
estimate
the
inhabitants
of
tripoli
at
about
fifteen
thousand
of
these
are
greek
christians
over
whom
a
bishop
presides
i
was
told
that
the
greeks
are
authorized
by
the
firmahns
of
the
porte
to
prevent
any
schismatic
greek
from
entering
the
town
this
may
not
be
the
fact
it
is
however
certain
that
whenever
a
schismatic
is
discovered
here
he
is
immediately
thrown
into
prison
put
in
irons
and
otherwise
very
such
a
statement
can
be
credited
by
those
only
who
are
acquainted
with
the
fanatism
of
the
eastern
christians
there
is
no
public
building
in
the
town
deserving
of
notice
the

itself
a

the
interjacent

formerly
covered
with
marshes
which
greatly
injured
the
air
but
the
greater
part
of
them
have
been
drained
and
converted
into
gardens
the
remains
of
a
wall
may
still
be
traced
across
the
triangular
plain
from
which
it
appears
that
the
western
point
was
the
site
of
the
ancient
city
wherever
the
ground
is
dug
in
that
direction
the
foundations
of

are
found
indeed
it
is

thus
procured
that
the

to
the
mouth
of
the
kadisha
runs
a
chain
of

about
ten

evidently
intended
for
the
defence
of

half
an

north
of

on
the
road
we
came
by
is
the
tomb
of
sheikh
el
bedawy
with
a
copious
spring
near
it
enclosed
by
a
wall
it
contains
a
great
quantity
of
fish
which
are
considered
sacred
by
the
turks
of
tripoli
and
are
fed
daily
by
the
guardians
of
the
tomb
and
by
the
tripolitans
no
person
dares
kill
any
of
them
they
are
as
the

express
it
a

to

tomb
the
same
kind
of
fish
is
found
in
the
kadisha
the
commerce
of
tripoli
has
decreased
lately
in
proportion
with
that
of
the
entire
commerce
of
syria
there
are
no
longer
any
frank
establishments
and
the
few
franks
who
still
remain
are
in
the
greatest
misery
a
french
consul
however
resides
here
guys
an
able
antiquary
and
who
was
very
liberal
in
his
literary
communications
to
us
he
has
a
very
interesting
collection
of
syrian
medals
catziflis
who
is
a
greek
is
a
very
respectable
man
and
rendered
considerable
services
to
the
english
army
during
the
war
in
egypt
he
is
extremely
attentive
and
hospitable
to
english
travellers
the
principal
commerce
of
tripoli
is
in
silk
produced
upon
the
mountain
of
which
it
exports
yearly
about
quintals
or
at
about
sterling
per
quintal
formerly
the
french
merchants
used
to
take
silk
in
return
for
their
goods
as
it
was
difficult
to
obtain
money
in
the
levantine
trade
it
is
true
that
they
sold
it
to
a
disadvantage
in
france
yet
not
so
great
as
they
would
have
done
had
they
insisted
on
being
reimbursed
ready
money
upon
which
they
must
have
paid
the
discount
the
silk
was
bought
up
at
marseilles
by
the
merchants
of
barbary
who
thus
procured
it
at
a
lower
rate
than
they
could
do
at
tripoli
this
intercourse
however
has
ceased
in
consequence
of
the
ruin
of
french
trade
and
the
moggrebyns
now
visit
tripoli
themselves
in
search
of
this
article
bringing
with
them
colonial
produce
indigo
and
tin
which
they
buy
at
malta
the
sale
of
west
india
coffee
has
of
late
increased
greatly
in
syria
the
turks
have
universally
adopted
the
use
of
it
because
it
is
not
more
than
half
the
price
of
mokha
coffee
a
considerable
market
is
thus
opened
to
the
west
india
planters
which
is
not
likely
to
be
interrupted
until
the
hadj
is
regularly
established
the
principal
traffic
of
which
was
in
coffee
the
next
chief
article
of
exportation
is
sponges
they
are
procured
on
the
sea
shore
but
the
best
are
found
at
a
little
depth
in
the
sea
the
demand
for
them
during
the
last
two
years
has
been
very
trifling
but
i
was
told
that
fifty
bales
of
twelve
thousand
sponges
each
might
be
yearly
furnished
their
price
is
from
to
forty
piastres
per
thousand
soap
is
exported
to
tarsous
for
anatolia
and
the
greek
islands
as
well
as
alkali
for
its
manufacture
which
is
procured
in
the
eastern
desert
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
soap
should
also
be
imported
into
tripoli
from
candia
the
reason
is
that
the
cretan
soap
contains
very
little
alkali
here
of
its
weight
of
alkali
is
added
to
it
and
in
this
state
it
is
sold
to
advantage
the
other
exports
are
about
one
hundred
or
one
hundred
and
twenty
quintals
of

for

upwards
of
six

the
duties
levied
upon

are
generally
calculated
by
the
number
of

to

in

those
on

peasant
who
rears
is
reckoned
to
pay
about
twenty
or
per

on

income
while
he

lives
by

he
refused
to

into

hands
of
youssef
pasha
of
damascus
who
had
also
been
invested
with
the
pashalik
of
tripoli
and
having
fortified
the
castle
he
boldly
awaited
with
a
few
trusty
adherents
the
arrival
of
youssef
who
approached
the
town
with
an
army
of
five
or
six
thousand
men
all
the
inhabitants
fled
to
the
mountain
except
the
french
consul
a
secret
enemy
of
berber
the
army
of
youssef
no
sooner
entered
the
city
than
they
began
plundering
it
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
they
completely
sacked
it
leaving
nothing
but
bare
walls
every
piece
of
iron
was
carried
off
and
even
the
marble
pavements
were
torn
up
and
sold
the
son
of
the
french
consul
gained
considerable
sums
by
buying
up
a
part
of
the
plunder
the
castle
was
now
besieged
and
some
french
artillerymen
having
been
brought
from
cyprus
a
breach
was
soon
made
but
though
defended
by
only
one
hundred
and
fifty
men
none
had
the
courage
to
advance
to
the
assault
after
a
siege
of
five
months
soleiman
pasba
of
acre
interceded
for
berber
and
youssef
pasha
glad
of
a
pretext
for
retreating
granted
the
garrison
every
kind
of
military
honours
the
remaining
provisions
in
the
castle
were
sold
to
the
pasha
for
ready
money
and
in
february
berber
accompanied
by
the
officers
of
soleiman
pasha
left
the
castle
and
retired
to
acre
he
was
again
named
governor
of
tripoli
when
soleiman
pasha
of
acre
and
damascus
was
in
invested
with
the
pashalik
of
tripoli
seid
soleiman
pasha
of
damascus
received
the
same
charge
in
during
our
stay
at
tripoli
berber
was
in
the
neigbbourhood
of
ladakie
making
war
against
some
rebel
anzeyrys
the
castle
of
tripoli
was
intrusted
to
the
command
of
an
aga
of
arnaouts
without
being
under
the
orders
of
berber
it
is
very
probable
that
berber
may
yet
become
a
conspicuous
character
in
syrian
affairs
being
a
man
of
great
spirit
firmness
and
justice
the
town
of
tripoli
was
never
in
a
better
state
than
when
under
his
command
march
having
spent
ten
days
at
tripoli
very
pleasantly
i
took
leave
of
my
companion
who
went
to
ladakie
and
antioch
and
set
out
with
a
guide
towards
damascus
with
the
intention
of
visiting
the
kesrouan
and
paying
my
respects
to
the
chief
of
the
deir
keiftein
mountain
the
emir
beshir
at
deir
el
kammar
on
the
way
i
wished
to
visit
some
ruins
in
the
koura
which
i
had
heard
of
at
tripoli
i
therefore
turned
out
of
the
great
road
which
follows
the
sea
shore
as
far
as
beirout
we
set
out
in
the
evening
ascended
the
castle
hill
to
the
of
the
town
and
arrived
after
an
hour
and
a
half
at
deir
keiftein
arabic
where
i
slept
the
road
lay
through
a
wood
of
olive
trees
on
the
left
bank
of
the
kadisha
over
the
lowest
declivities
of
the
libanus
it
is
a
part
of
the
district
el
koura
the
principal
produce
of
which
is
oil
the
zawye
on
the
other
side
of
the
kadisha
also
produces
oil
and
at
the
same
time
more
grain
than
the
koura
every
olive
tree
here
is
worth
from
fifteen
to
twenty
piastres
the
soil
in
which
the
trees
grow
is
regularly
ploughed
but
nothing
is
sown
between
the
trees
as
it
is
found
that
any
other
vegetation
diminishes
the
quantity
of
olives
the
ground
round
the
stem
is
covered
to
the
height
of
two
or
three
feet
with
earth
to
prevent
the
sun
from
hurting
the
roots
and
to
give
it
the
full
benefit

here
left

see
the
ruins

i
had
been
informed
at

in
twenty
minutes
i
reached
the
remains
of
an
ancient
town
standing
on

piece

but
with
few
houses
remaining
these
ruins
are
called
by
the
people
of
the
country
naous

namous

name
is
supposed
to
be
derived
from
the
word
arabic
a
but
i
think
its
derivation
from
the
greek
greek
more
probable
on
the
side
stand
the
ruins
of
two
temples
which
are
worth
the
naous
traveller
attention
the
smaller
one
is
very
much
like
the
temple
of
hossn
el

near
zahle
which
i
had
seen
on

way
to
baalbec
it
is
an
oblong

about

is
built
with
large
square

fallen
in

a
broad
staircase
leads
up
from
it
to

the
two
of
this
outer

are
still
standing
each
formed
of
a
single
stone
about
thirteen
feet
high
rudely
adorned
with

at
about
one
hundred

fifty
yards
from

much
larger

it
stands
in
an
area
of
fifty
paces
in

sixty
in

surrounded
by
a
wall
of
which
the
foundation
and
some

the
entrance
to

is
through
a
beautiful
gate
still

is
fourteen
feet
high

ten
feet

the
two

and
the
soffit
are
each
formed

are
elegantly
sculptured
at
the

and
elevated
four
or
five
feet
above
its
level
stood
the
temple
opposite
to
the
great
gate
it
presents
nothing
now
but
a
heap
of
ruins
among
which
it
is
impossible
to
trace
the
original
distribution
of
the
building
the
ground
is
covered
with
columns

and
friezes
i
saw
a
fragment
of
a
column
consisting
of
one
piece
of
stone
nine
feet
in
length
and
three
feet
and
a
half
in

the
columns
are
corinthian
but
not
of
the
best
workmanship
near
the
angle
of
the
temple
are
the
foundations
of
a
small
insulated
building
beshiza
in
order
to
level
the
surface
of
the
area
and
to
support
the
northern
wall
a
terrace
was
anciently
raised
which
is
ten
feet
high
in
the
corner
the
wall
of
the
area
is
built
with
large
blocks
of
well
cut
stone
some
of
which
are
upwards
of
twelve
feet
in
length
it
appears
however
to
have
undergone
repairs
as
several
parts
of
the
wall
are
evidently
of
modern
construction
it
has
perhaps
been
used
as
a
by
the
arabs
the
stone
of
the
building
is
calcareous
but
not
so
hard
as
the
rock
of
baalbec
i
saw
no
kind
of

there
is

turning
from
thence
in
a
direction
reached
in

the

torrent
of
nahr
beshiza
arabic
which
dries
up
in
summer
time
but
in

sometimes
swells
rapidly
to

intelligence
was
received
at
a

that
a

intended
to
plunder
the

fled
with
their
most
valuable
moveables
the

evening
and
retired
up
the
wady
beshiza
where
they
passed
the
night
it
had
unfortunately
rained
in
the
mountains
above
and
during
the
night
the
torrent
suddenly
swelled
and
carried
away
eight
or
ten
families

had
encamped
in

about
fifteen

been
thrown
out
of

the
entrance
is
from

or
rather
from
the
for
the
temple
does
not
face
the
four
cardinal
amyoun
points
the
northern

instead
of
completing
the
quadrangle
consists
of
two
curves
about
twelve
feet
in

and
both
vaulted
like
niches
as
high
as
the

are
several
projecting
bases
for
statues
the
door
and
its
soffit
which
is
formed
of
a
single
stone
are
ornamented
with
beautiful
sculptures
which
are
not
inferior
to
those
of
baalbec
before
the
entrance
was
a
portico
of
four
ionic
columns
of
which
three
are
standing
they
are
about
eighteen
feet
high
and
of
a
single
stone
opposite
to

of
the
exterior
columns
of
this
portico
is
a
pilaster

there
are
also
two
other
pilasters
in
the
opposite
or
eastern
wall
between
the
two
middle
columns
of
the
portico
is
a
gate
six
feet
high
formed
of
two
posts
with
a
stone
laid
across
them
this
is
probably
of
modern
date
as
the
exterior
of
the
northern
wall
also
appears
to
be
instead
of
forming
two
semicircles
as
within
it
is
polygonal
between
the
door
and

of

the
entablature
of
the
portico
is
perfect
in
the

of
the
building
stands
a
large
old
oak
tree
whose
branches
overshadow
the
temple
and
supply
the
place
of

roof
rendering
the
ruin
a
highly
picturesque
object

half
an
hour
to
the
west
of
beshiza
lies
the
village
of
deir
bashtar
arabic
from
the

we
turned
and
at

a
collector

he
pays

many
christian
families
are
governors
of
provinces

sheikhs
of
villages
in
the
mountains
in
collecting
the
miri
and
making
the
repartitions
of
the
extraordinary
demands
made
by
the
emir
they
always
gain
considerable
sums
but
whenever
a
sheikh
has
filled
his
purse
he
is
sure
to
fall
a
victim
to
the
avidity
of
the
chief
governor
these
sheikhs
affect
all
the
pomp
of
the
turks
surpass
them
in
family
pride
and
equal
them
in
avarice
low
intrigue
and
fanatism
the
governor
of
the
province
of
zawye
is
also
a
christian
of
the
family
of
dhaher
instead
of
descending
towards
the
sea
shore
which
is
the
usual
route
to
batroun
i
preferred
continuing
in
the
mountain
at
an
hour
and
a
quarter
from
amyoun
after
having
twice
passed
the
beshiza
or
as
it
is
also
called
the
nahr
aszfour
which
runs
in
a
very
narrow
wady
descending
from
the
district
of
laklouk
we
reached
the
village
of
keftoun

in
its
neighbourhood
dar

the
industry
with
which
these
mountaineers
cultivate
upon
the
narrow
terraces
formed
on
the
steep
declivity
of
the
mountain
their
vines
and
mulberry
trees
with
a
few
acres
of
corn
is
really
admirable
at
two
hours
the
village

right
a
little
farther
to
the
right
ras
enhash
arabic
below
on
the
sea
shore
at

extremity
of
a
point
of

is
a
large
village
called
amfy
arabic
and
near
it
the
convent
deir
natour
it
is
with
great
difficulty
that
a
horse
can
travel
through
these
mountains
the
roads
are
abominable
and
the
inhabitants
always
keep
them
so
in

to
render
the
invasion
of
their
country
more
difficult
the
direction
of
batroun
from
the
point
where
the
road
begins
to
descend
is
we
descended
the
mountain
called
akabe
el
meszabeha
near
the
wady
djaous
which
lower
down
takes
the
name
of
nahr
meszabeha
two
hours

a
half
from
amyoun
on
the
descent
is
a
fine
spring
with
a
vaulted
covering
over
it
called
ayn
el
khowadja
arabic
at
the
end
of
three
hours
we
reached
batroun
a
narrow
valley
watered
by
the
last
mentioned
river
and
bounded
on
the
right
hand
by
djebel
nourye
which
advances
towards
the
sea
and
on
the
left
by
another
mountain
upon
the
former
stands
the
village
hammad

on
the
point
of
it
over
the
sea
the
convent
of
mar
elias
at
three
hours
and
a
quarter
and
where
the
valley
is
scarcely
ten
minutes
in
breadth
a
castle
of
modern
construction
stands
upon
an
insulated
rock
it
is
called
kalaat
meszabeha
arabic
its
walls
are
very
slight
but
the
rock
upon
which
it
stands
is
so
steep
that
no
beast
of
burthen
can
ascend
it
this
castle
was
once
in
possession
of
the
metaweli
who
frequently
attacked
the
passengers
in
the
valley
near
it
is
a
bridge
over
the
wady
at
three
hours
and
three
quarters
where
the
valley
opens
towards
the
sea
is
the
village
kobba
arabic
at
the
foot
of
the
djebel
nourye
with
an
ancient
tower
near
it
at
the
end
of
four
hours
and
a
quarter
we
reached
batroun
arabic
where
i
slept
in
one
of
the
small
khans
which
are
built
by
the
sea
side
batroun
the
ancient
bostrys
contains
at
present
three
or
four
hundred
houses
its
inhabitants
are
for
the
greater
part
maronites
the
rest
are
greeks
and
turks
the
town
and
its
territory
belong
to
the
emir
beshir
but
it
is
under
the
immediate
government
of
two
of
his
relations
emir
kadan

emir
melhem
the
principal
man
in
the
town
is
the
christian
sheikh
of
the
family

the
produce
of
batroun

chiefly
in
tobacco
there
is
no
harbour
merely
an
inlet
capable
of
admitting
a
couple
of
coasting
boats
the
whole
coast
from
tripoli
to
beirout
appears
to
be
formed
of
sand
accumulated
by
the
prevailing
westerly
winds
and
hardened
into
rocks
an
artificial
shelter
seems
to
have
been
anciently
formed
by
excavating
the
rocks
and
forming
a
part
of
them
into
a
wall
of
moderate
thickness
for
the
length
of
one
hundred
paces
and
to
the
height
of
twelve
feet
it
was
probably
behind
this
wall
that
the
boats
of
bostrys
anciently
found
shelter
djebail
from
the
westerly
gales
i
saw
but
one
boat
between

our
road
lay
along
the
rocky
coast
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
we
came
to

without

the

some
parts

which
appear
to
be

the
district
of
djebail
was
under
the
command
of
abd
el
ahad
who
built
a
very
good
house
here
but
the
two
brothers
shared
the
fate
of
all
christians
who
attempt
to
rise
above
their
sphere
they
were
both
put
to
death
in
the
same
hour
by
the
emir
orders
indeed
there
is
scarcely
an
instance
in
the
modern
history
of
syria
of
a
christian

jew
having
long
enjoyed
the
power

his

still
unabated

an
ancient

call
it

from
an
echo

is
heard
here
if

in

of
separation
between
the
pahaliks

and
divide
the
district
of
fetouh
from
that
of
kesrouan
the
country
of
kesrouan
which
i
now
entered
presents
a
most
interesting
aspect
on
the
one
hand
are
steep
and
lofty
mountains
full
of
villages
and
convents
built
on
their
rocky
sides
and
on
the
other
a
fine
bay
and
a
plain
of
about
a
mile
in
breadth
extending
from
the
mountains
to
the
sea
there
is
hardly
any
place
in
syria
less
fit
for
culture
than
the
kesrouan
yet
it
has
become
the
most
populous
part
of
the
country
the
satisfaction
of
inhabiting
the
neighbourhood
of
places
of
sanctity
of
hearing
church
bells
which
are
found
in
no
other
part
of
syria
and
of
being
able
to
give
a
loose
to
religious
feelings
and
to
rival
the
mussulmans
in
fanatisim
are
the
chief
attractions
that
have
peopled
kesrouan
with
catholic
christians
for
the
present
state
of
this
country
offers
no
political
advantages
whatever
on
the
contrary
the
extortions
of
the
druses
have
reduced
the
peasant
to
the
most
miserable
state
of
poverty
more
miserable
even
than
that
in
the
eastern
plains
of
syria
nothing
therefore
but
religious
freedom
induces
the
christians
to
submit
to
these
extortions
added
perhaps
to
the
pleasure
which
the
catholics
derive
from
persecuting
their
brethren
of
the
greek
church
for
the
few
greeks
who
are
settled
here
are
not
better
treated
by
the
maronites
than
a
damascene
christian
might
expect
to
be

friendly
reception

of

which
his
residence
of
upwards
of
twelve
years

enabled

i
left

in

has
given
now
that
passions
have
cooled
and
that
the
greater
part
of
the
persons
concerned
are
dead
it
is
the
general
opinion
that
hindye
only
crime
was
her
ambition
to
pass
for
a
saint
the
abominable
acts
of
debauchery
and
cruelty
of
which
she
was
accused
are
probably
imaginary
but
it
is
certain
that
she
rigorously
punished
the
nuns
of
her
convent
who
hesitated
to
believe
in
her
sanctity
or
who
doubted
the
visits
of

sahel
alma
march
i
slept
at
harissa
and
left
it
early
in
the
morning
to
visit
ayn
warka
the
roads
in
these
mountains
are
bad
beyond
description
indeed
i
never
before
saw
any
inhabited
country
so
entirely
mountainous
as
the
kesrouan
there
are
no
levels
on
the
tops
of
the
mountain
but
the
traveller
no
sooner
arrives
on
the
summit
than
he
immediately
begins
the
descent
each
hill
is
insulated
so
that
to
reach
a
place
not
more
than
ten
minutes
distant
in
a
straight
line
one
is
obliged
to
travel
three
or
four
miles
by
descending
into
the
valley
and
ascending
again
the
other
side
from
harissa
i
went
north
half
an
hour
to
the
village
ghosta
arabic
near
which
are
two
convents
called
kereim
and
baklous
kereim
ayn
warka
is
a
rich
armenian
monastery
in
which
are
twenty
monks
the
silk
of
this
place
is
esteemed
the
best
in
kesrouan
a
little
farther
down
is
the
village
el
basha
one
hour
and
a
quarter
ayn
warka
arabic
another
maronite
convent
i
wished
to
see
this
place
because
i
had
heard
that
a
school
had
lately
been
established
here
and
that
the
convent
contained
a
good
library
of
syrian
books
but
i
was
not
so
fortunate
as
to
see
the
library
the
bishop
although
he
received
me
well
found
a
pretext
for
not
opening
the
room
in
which
the
books
are
kept
fearing
probably
that
if
his
treasures
should
be
known
the
convent
might
some
day
be
deprived
of
them
i
however
saw
a
beautiful
dictionary
in
large
folio
of
the
syriac
language
written
in
the
syriac
character
which
i
suppose
to
be
the
only
copy
in
syria
its
author
was
djorjios
el
kerem
seddany
who
composed
it
in
the
year
kerem
seddany
is
the
name
of
a
village
near
bshirrai
this
dictionary
may
be
worth
in
syria
eight
hundred
or
a
thousand
piastres
but
the
convent
would
certainly
not
sell
it
for
less
than
two
thousand
besides
a
present
to
the
bishop
the
school
of
ayn
warka
was
established
fifteen
years
since
by
youssef
the
predecessor
of
the
present
bishop
it
is
destined
to
educate
sixteen
poor
maronite
children
for
the
clerical
profession
they
remain
here
for
six
or
eight
years
during
which
they
are
fed
and
clothed
at
the
expense
of
the
convent
and
are
educated
according
to
the
literary
taste
of
the
country
that
is
to
say
in
addition
to
their
religious
duties
they
are
taught
grammar
logic
and
philosophy
the
principal
books
of
instruction
are
the
belough
el
arab
arabic
and
the
behth
el
mettalae
arabic
both
composed
by
the
bishop
djermanous
arabic
at
present
there
is
only
one
schoolmaster
but
another
is
shortly
expected
bezommar
to
teach
philosophy
the
boys
have
particular
hours
assigned
to
the
different
branches
of
their
studies
i
found
them
sitting
or
lying
about
in
the
each
reading
a
book
and
the
master
in
a
common
peasant
dress
in
the
midst
of
them
besides
the
arabic
language
they
are
taught
to
speak
write
and
read
the
syriac
the
principal
syriac
authors
whose
books
are
in
the
library
are
ibn
el
ebre
arabic
or
as
the
latins
call
him
berebreo
obeyd
yeshoua
arabic
and
ibn
el
aassal
arabic
their
works
are
chiefly
on
divinity
the
bishop
is
building
a
dormitory
for
the
boys
in
which
each
of
them
is
to
have
his
separate
room
he
has
also
begun
to
take
in
pupils
from
all
parts
of
syria
whose
parents
pay
for
their
board
and
education
the
convent
has
considerable
landed
property
and
its
income
is
increased
by
alms
from
the
catholic
syrians
the
boys
on
leaving
the
convent
are
obliged
to
take
orders
from
ayn
warka
i
ascended
to
the
convent
of
bezommar
arabic
one
hour
and
a
quarter
distant
it
belongs
to
the
armenian
catholics
and
is
the
seat
of
the
armenian
patriarch
or
spiritual
head
of
all
the
armenians
in
the
east
who
have
embraced
the
catholic
faith
bezommar
is
built
upon
the
highest
summit
of
the
mountain
of
kesrouan
which
is
a
lower
branch
of
the
southern
libanus
it
is
the
finest
and
the
richest
convent
in
kesrouan
and
is
at
present
inhabited
by
the
old
patriarch
youssef
four
bishops
twelve
monks
and
seventeen
priests
the
patriarch
himself
built
the
convent
at
an
expense
of
upwards
of
fifteen
thousand
pounds
sterling
its
income
is
considerable
and
is
derived
partly
from
its
great
landed
possessions
and
partly
from
the
benefactions
of
persons
at
constantinople
in
asia
minor
and
in
syria
the
venerable
patriarch
received
me
in
his
bed
from
which
i
fear
he
will
never
rise
again
the
armenian
priests
state
of
kesrouan
of
this
convent
are
social
and
obliging
with
little
of
the
pride
and
hypocrisy
of
the
maronites
several
of
them
had
studied
at
rome
the
convent
educates
an
indefinite
number
of
poor
boys
at
present
there
are
eighteen
who
are
destined
to
take
orders
they
are
clothed
and
fed
gratis
boys
are
sent
here
from
all
parts
of
the
levant
i
enquired
after
armenian
manuscripts
but
was
told
that
the
convent
possessed
only
armenian
books
printed
at
venice
i
left
bezommar
to
return
to

half
an

again
passed

on
my
descent
to
antoura
which
is
two
hours

a

distant
from

the
district
of

which
is
about
three
hours
and
a
half
in
length
from

from
two

three
hours
in

across
the

inhabited
by

neither

of

emir
beshir
resides
at
ghazir
to
protect
the
country
and
take
care
of
his
father
private
property
in
the
district
the
principal
and
almost
sole
produce
is
silk
mulberry
trees
are
consequently
the
chief
growth
of
the
soil
wheat
and
barley
are
sown
but
not
in
sufficient
quantity
for
the
consumption
of
the
people
the
quantity
of
silk
produced
annually
amounts
to
about
sixty
kantars
or
three
hundred
and
thirty
english
quintals
a
man
wealth
is
estimated
by
the
number
of
rotolas
of
silk
which
he
makes
and
the
annual
taxes
paid
to
government
are
calculated
and
distributed
in
proportion
to
them
the
miri
or
is
taken
upon
the
mule
loads
of
mulberry
leaves
eight
or
ten
trees
in
common
years
yielding
one
load
and
as
the
income
of
the
proprietors
depends
entirely
upon
the
growth
of
these
leaves
they
suffer
less
from
a
bad
crop
because
their
taxes
are
proportionally
low
the
extraordinary
extortions
of
the
government
however
are
excessive
the
emir
often
exacts
five
or
six
miris
in
the
year
and
one
levy
of
money
is
no
sooner
paid
than
orders
are
received
for
a
fresh
one
of
twenty
or
thirty
purses
upon
the
province
the
village
sheikh
fixes
the
contributions
to
be
paid
by
each
village
taking
care
to
appropriate
a
part
of
them
to
himself
last
year
many
peasants
were
obliged
to
sell
a
part
of
their
furniture
to
defray
the
taxes
it
may
easily
be
conceived
therefore
in
what
misery
they
live
they
eat
scarcely
any
thing
but
the
worst
bread
and
oil
or
soups
made
of
the
wild
herbs
of
which
tyranny
can
not
deprive
them
notwithstanding
the
wretchedness
in
which
they
are
left
by
the
government
they
have
still
to
satisfy
the
greediness
of
their
priests
but
these
contributions
they
pay
with
cheerfulness
many
of
the
convents
indeed
are
too
rich
to
require
their
assistance
but
those
which
are
poor
together
with
all
the
parish
priests
and
church
officers
live
upon
the
people
such
is
the
condition
of
this
christian
commonwealth
which
instead
of
deserving
the
envy
of
other
christians
living
under
the
turkish
yoke
is
in
a
more
wretched
state
than
any
other
part
of
syria
but
the
predominance
of
their
church
consoles
them
under
every
affliction
and
were
the
druse
governor
to
deprive
them
of
the
last
para
they
would
still
remain
in
the
vicinity
of
their
convent
contributions
are
never
levied
on
the
convents
though
the
landed
property
belonging
to
them
pays
duties
like
that
of
the
peasant
their
income
from
abroad
is
free
from
taxes
loans
are
sometimes
required
of
the
convents
but
they
are
regularly
reimbursed
in
the
time
of
the
next
harvest
the
priests
are
the
most
nahr
el
kelb
happy
part
of
the
population
of
kesrouan
they
are
under
no
anxiety
for
their
own
support
they
are
looked
upon
by
the

assuperior

and
their

a

i
could
not

it
turns
round
the
side
of
the
mountain
to
deir
el
kammar
distant
seven
hours
and
a
quarter
from
el
mellaha
i
rode
through
el
kammar
without
stopping
and
proceeded
to
the
village
of
beteddein
where
the
emir
beshir
is
building
a
new
palace
beteddein
the
town
of
deir
el
kammar
is
situated
on
the
declivity
of
the
mountain
at
the
head
of
a
narrow
valley
descending
towards
the
sea
it
is
inhabited
by
about
nine
hundred
maronite
three
hundred
druse
and
fifteen
or
twenty
turkish
families
who
cultivate
mulberry
and
vine
plantations
and
manufacture
all
the
articles
of
dress
of
the
mountaineers
they
are
particularly
skilful
in
working
the
rich
abbas
or
gowns
of
silk
interwoven
with
gold
and
silver
which
are
worn
by
the
great
sheikhs
of
the
druses
and
which
are
sold
as
high
as
eight
hundred
piastres
a
piece
the
emir
beshir
has
a
serai
here
the
place
seems
to
be
tolerably
well
built
and
has
large
bazars
the
tombs
of
the
christians
deserve
notice
every
family
has
a
stone
building
about
forty
feet
square
in
which
they
place
their
dead
the
entrance
being
always
walled
up
after
each
deposit
this
mode
of
interment
is
peculiar
to
deir
el
kammar
and
arose
probably
from
the
difficulty
of
excavating
graves
in
the
rocky
soil
on
which
it
is
built
the
tombs
of
the
richer
christian
families
have
a
small
kubbe
on
their
summit
the
name
of
this
town
signifying
the
monastery
of
the
moon
originates
in
a
convent
which
formerly
stood
here
dedicated
to
the
virgin
who
is
generally
represented
in

beneath
her
feet
half
an
hour
from
deir
el
kammar
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
lies
beteddein
arabic
which
in
syriac
means
the
two
teats
and
has
received
its
name
from
the
similarity
of
two
neighbouring
hills
upon
one
of
which
the
village
is
built
almost
all
the
villages
in
this
neighbourhood
have
syriac
names
march
the
emir
beshir
to
whom
i
had
letters
of
recommendation
from
barker
at
aleppo
received
me
very
politely
and
insisted
upon
my
living
at
his
house
his
new
palace
is
a
very
costly
edifice
but
at
the
present
rate
of
its
progress
five
more
years
will
be
required
to
finish
it
the
building
consists
of
a
large
quadrangle
one
on
side
of
which
are
the
emir
apartments
and
his
harem
with
a
private
two
other
sides
contain
small
apartments
for
his
people
and
the
fourth
is
open
towards
the
valley
and
deir
el
kammar
commanding
a
distant
view
of
the
sea
in
the
neighbouring
mountain
is
a
spring
the
waters
from
which
have
been
conducted
into
the
quadrangle
but
the
emir
wishes
to
have
a
more
abundant
supply
of
water
and
intends
to
bring
a
branch
of
the
nahr
el
kadhi
thither
for
this
purpose
the
water
must
be
diverted
from
the
main
stream
at
a
distance
of
three
hours
and
the
expense
of
the
canal
is
calculated
at
three
thousand
pounds
sterling
the
emir
beshir
is
at
present
master
of
the
whole
mountain
from
belad

down
to
near
akka

including
the
valley
of
bekaa
and
part
of
the
and

the
bekaa
together
with
a

of
one
hundred
purses
was
given
to
him
in
by

pasha
of
acre
for
his
assistance
against
youssef
pasha
of
damascus
he
pays
for
the
possession
of
the
whole
country
five
hundred
and
thirty
purses
of
which
one
hundred
and
thirty
go
to
tripoli
and
four
hundred
to
saida
or
acre
this
is
exclusive
of
the
extraordinary
demands
of
the
pashas
which
amount
to
at
least
three
hundred
purses
more
these
sums
are
paid
in
lieu
of
the
miri
which
the
emir
collects
himself
without
accounting
for
it
the
power
of
the
emir
however
is
a
mere
shadow
the
real
government
being
in
the
hands
of
the
druse
chief
sheikh
beshir
beshir
is
a
proper
name
borne
by
many
people
in
the
mountain
the
accent
is
on
the
last
syllable
the
sound
would
be
expressed
in
english
by
besheer
i
shall
here
briefly
explain
the
political
state
of
the
mountain
it
is
now
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
years
since
the
government
of
the
mountain
has
been
always
entrusted
by
the
pashas
of
acre
and
tripoli
to
an
individual
of
the
family
of
shehab
arabic
to
which
the
emir
beshir
belongs
this
family
derives
its
origin
from
mekka
where
its
name
is
known
in
the
history
of
mohammed
and
the
first
califes
they
are
mussulmans
and
some
of
them
pretend
even
to
be
sherifs
about
the
time
of
the
crusades
for
i
have
been
unable
to
ascertain
the
exact
period
the
shehabs
left
the
hedjaz
and
settled
in
a
village
of
the
haouran
to
which
they
gave
their
family
name
a
branch
of
the
family
is
said
to
inhabit
some
mountains
in
mesopotamia
under
the
command
of
emir
kasem
it
is
still
known
by
the
appellation
of
shohba
and
is
remarkable
for
its
antiquities
of
which
i
have
given
some
account
in
my
journal
of
a
tour
in
the
haouran
the
family
being
noble
or
of
emir
origin
were
considered
proper
persons
to
be
governors
of
the
mountain
for
it
was
and
still
is
thought
necessary
that
the
government
should
not
be
in
the
hands
of
a
druse
the
druses
being
always
divided
into
parties
a
governor
chosen
from
among
them
would
have
involved
the
country
in
the
quarrels
of
his
own
party
and
he
would
have
been
always
endeavouring
to
exterminate
his
adversaries
whereas
a
turk
by
carefully
managing
both
parties
maintains
a
balance
between
them
though
he
is
never
able
to
overpower
them
completely
he
can
oppose
the
christian
inhabitants
to
the
druses
who
are
in
much
smaller
numbers
than
the
former
and
thus
he
is
enabled
to
keep
the
country
in
a
state
of
tranquillity
and
in
subjection
to
the
pashas
this
policy
has
long
been
successful
notwithstanding
the
turbulent
spirit
of
the
mountaineers
the
continual
party
feuds
and
the
ambitious
projects
of
many
chiefs
as
well
of
the
druses
as
of
the
reigning
house
the
pashas
were
careful
also
not
to
permit
any
one
to
become
too
powerful
the
princes
of
the
reigning
family
were
continually
changed
and
party
spirit
was
revived
in
the
mountain
whenever
the
interests
of
the
porte
required
it
about
eighty
years
ago
the
country
was
divided
into
the
two
great
parties
of
keisy
arabic
whose
banner
was
red
and
yemeny
arabic
whose
banner
was
white
and
the
whole
christian
population
ranged
itself
on
the
one
side
or
the
other
the
keisy
gained
at
length
the
entire
ascendancy
after
which
none
but
secret
adherents
of
the
yemeny
remained
and
the
name
itself
was
forgotten
then
arose
the
three
sects
of
djonbelat
yezbeky
and
neked
these
still
exist
thirty
years
ago
the
two
first
were
equal
but
the
djonbelat
have
now
got
the
upper
hand
and
have
succeeded
in
disuniting
the
yezbeky
and
neked
the
djonbelat
arabic
draw
their
origin
from
the
druse
mountain
of
djebel
aala
between
ladakie
and
aleppo
they
are
an
old
and
noble
family
and
in
the
seventeenth
century
one
of
their
ancestors
was
pasha
of
aleppo
it
forms
at
present
the
richest
and
most
numerous
family
and
the
strongest
party
in
the
mountain
the
yezbeky
arabic
or
as
they
are
also
called
el
aemad
arabic
are
few
in
number
but
are
reputed
men
of
great
courage
and
enterprize
their
principal
residence
is
in
the
district
of
el
barouk
between
deir
el
kammar
and
zahle
the
neked
whose
principal
sheikh
is
at
present
named
soleiman
inhabit
for
the
greater
part
deir
el
kammar
seven
of
their
principal
chiefs
were
put
to
death
thirteen
years
ago
in
the
serai
of
the
emir
beshir
and
a
few
only
of
their
children
escaped
the
massacre
these
have
now
attained
to
years
of
manhood
and
remain
at
deir
el
kammar
watched
by
the
djonbelaty
and
the
aemad
who
are
united
against
them
the
djonbelat
now
carry
every
thing
with
a
high
hand
their
chief
el
sheikh
beshir
is
the
richest
and
the
shrewdest
man
in
the
mountain
besides
his
personal
property
which
is
very
considerable
no
affair
of
consequence
is
concluded
without
his
interest
being
courted
and
dearly
paid
for
his
annual
income
amounts
to
about
two
thousand
purses
or
fifty
thousand
pounds
sterling
the
whole
province
of
shouf
is
under
his
command
and
he
is
in
partnership
with
almost
all
the
druses
who
possess
landed
property
there
the
greater
part
of
the
district
of
djesn
arabic
is
his
own
property
and
he
permits
no
one
to
obtain
possesions
in
that
quarter
while
he
increases
his
own
estates
yearly
and
thus
continually
augments
his
power
the
emir
beshir
can
do
nothing
important
without
the
consent
of
the
sheikh
beshir
with
whom
he
is
obliged
to
share
all
the
contributions
which
he
extorts
from
the
mountaineers
it
is
from
this
cause
that
while
some
parts
of
the
mountain
are
very
heavily
taxed
in
others
little
is
paid
the
druses
form
the
richest
portion
of
the
population
but
they
supply
little
to
the
public
contributions
being
protected
by
the
sheikh
beshir
it
will
be
asked
perhaps
why
the
sheikh
does
not
set
aside
the
emir
beshir
and
take
the
ostensible
power
into
his
own
hands
many
persons
believe
that
he
entertains
some
such
design
while
others
better
informed
perhaps
assert
that
the
sheikh
will
never
make
the
attempt
because
he
knows
that
the
mountaineers
would
never
submit
to
a
druse
chief
the
druses
are
certainly
in
a
better
condition
at
present
than
they
would
be
under
the
absolute
sway
of
the
sheikh
who
would
soon
begin
to
oppress
instead
of
protecting
them
as
he
now
does
and
the
christians
who
are
a
warlike
people
detest
the
name
of
druse
too
much
ever
to
yield
quietly
to
a
chief
of
that
community
it
is
probably
in
the
view
of
attaching
the
christians
more
closely
to
him
and
to
oppose
them
in
some
measure
to
the
druses
that
the
emir
beshir
with
his
whole
family
has
secretly
embraced
the
christian
religion
the
shehab
as
i
have
already
mentioned
were
formerly
members
of
the
true
mussulman
faith
and
they
never
have
had
among
them
any
followers
of
the
doctrines
of
the
druses
they
still
affect
publicly
to
observe
the
mohammedan
rites
they
profess
to
fast
during
the
ramadhan
and
the
pashas
still
treat
them
as
turks
but
it
is
no
longer
matter
of
doubt
that
the
greater
part
of
the
shehab
with
the
emir
beshir
at
their
head
have
really
embraced
that
branch
only
of
the
family
which
governs
at
rasheya
and
hasbeya
continue
in
the
religion
of
their
ancestors
although
the
christians
of
the
mountain
have
thus
become
more
attached
to
their
prince
their
condition
on
the
whole
is
not
bettered
as
the
emir
scarcely
dares
do
justice
to
a
christian
against
a
druse
still
however
the
christians
rejoice
in
having
a
prince
of
their
own
faith
and
whose
counsellors
and
household
are
with
few
exceptions
of
the
same
religion
there
are
not
more
than
forty
or
fifty
persons
about
him
who
are
not
christians
one
of
the
prince
daughters
lately
married
a
druse
of
an
emir
family
who
was
not
permitted
to
celebrate
the
nuptials
till
he
had
been
instructed
in
the
doctrines
of
christianity
had
been
baptized
and
had
received
the
sacrament
how
far
the
shehab
may
be
sincere
in
their
professions
i
am
unable
to
decide
it
is
probable
that
if
their
interests
should
require
it
they
would
again
embrace
the
religion
of
their
ancestors
in
order
to
strengthen
his
authority
the
emir
beshir
has
formed
a
close
alliance
with
soleiman
pasha
of
acre
thus
abandoning
the
policy
of
his
predecessors
who
were
generally
the
determined
enemies
of
the
turkish
governors
this
alliance
is
very
expensive
to
the
prince
though
it
serves
in
some
degree
to
counterbalance
the
influence
of
the
sheikh
beshir
the
emir
and
the
sheikh
are
apparently
on
the
best
terms
the
latter
visits
the
emir
almost
every
week
attended
by
a
small
retinue
of
horsemen
and
is
always
received
with
the
greatest
apparent
cordiality
i
saw
him
at
beteddein
during
my
stay
there
his
usual
residence
is
at
the
village
of
mokhtar
arabic
three
hours
distant
from
beteddein
where
he
has
built
a
good
house
and
keeps
an
establishment
of
about
two
hundred
men
his
confidential
attendants
and
even
the
porters
of
his
harem
are
christians
but
his
bosom
friend
is
sheikh
el
nedjem
arabic
a
fanatical
druse
and
one
of
the
most
respected
of
their
akals
the
sheikh
beshir
has
the
reputation
of
being
generous
and
of
faithfully
defending
those
who
have
put
themselves
under
his
protection
the
emir
beshir
on
the
contrary
is
said
to
be
avaricious
but
this
may
be
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
smallness
of
his
income
he
is
an
amiable
man
and
if
any
levantine
can
be
called
the
friend
of
an
european
nation
he
certainly
is
the
friend
of
the
english
he
dwells
on
no
topic
with
so
much
satisfaction
as
upon
that
of
his
alliance
with
sir
sidney
smith
during
that
command
upon
this
coast
his
income
amounts
at
most
to
four
hundred
purses
or
about
sterling
after
deducting
from
the
revenue
of
the
mountain
the
sums
paid
to
the
pashas
to
the
sheikh
beshir
and
to
the
numerous
branches
of
his
family
his
favourite
expenditure
seems
to
be
in
building
he
keeps
about
fifty
horses
of
which
a
dozen
are
of
prime
quality
his
only
amusement
is
sporting
with
the
hawk
and
the
pointer
he
lives
on
very
bad
terms
with
his
family
who
complain
of
his
neglecting
them
for
the
greater
part
of
them
are
poor
and
will
become
still
poorer
till
they
are
reduced
to
the
state
of
fellahs
because
it
is
the
custom
with
the
sons
as
soon
as
they
attain
the
age
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
to
demand
the
share
of
the
family
property
which
is
thus
divided
among
them
the
father
retaining
but
one
share
for
himself
several
princes
of
the
family
are
thus
reduced
to
an
income
of
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
it
has
constantly
been
the
secret
endeavour
of
the
emir
beshir
to
make
himself
directly
dependent
upon
the
porte
and
to
throw
off
his
allegiance
to
the
pasha
but
he
has
never
been
able
to
succeed
the
conduct
of
djezzar
pasha
was
the
cause
of
this
policy
djezzar
for
reasons
which
have
already
been
explained
was
continually
changing
the
governors
of
the
mountain
and
each
new
governor
was
obliged
to
promise
him
large
sums
for
his
investiture
of
these
sums
few
were
paid
at
the
time
of
djezzar
death
and
bills
to
the
amount
of
sixteen
thousand
purses
were
found
in
his
treasury
secured
upon
the
revenue
of
the
mountain
at
the
intercession
of
soleiman
pasha
who
succeeded
djezzar
at
akka
and
of
gharib
effendi
the
commissioner
now
pasha
of
aleppo
this
sum
was
reduced
to
four
thousand
purses
of
which
the
emir
beshir
is
now
obliged
to
pay
off
a
part
annually
by
opposing
the
druse
parties
to
each
other
and
taking
advantage
of
the
christian
population
a
man
of
genius
and
energy
of
the
shehab
family
might
perhaps
succeed
in
making
himself
the
independent
master
of
the
mountain
such
an
event
would
render
this
the
most
important
government
in
syria
and
no
military
force
the
turks
could
send
would
be
able
to
overthrow
it
but
at
present
the
shehab
appear
to
have
no
man
of
enterprise
among
them
the
shehab
marry
only
among
themselves
or
with
two
druse
families
the
merad
arabic
and
kaszbeya
arabic
these
and
the
reslan
arabic
are
the
only
emir
families
or
descendants
of
the
prophet
among
the
druses
these
emirs
inhabit
the
province
called
el
meten
emir
manzour
the
chief
of
the
merads
is
a
man
of
influence
with
a
private
annual
income
of
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
purses
i
shall
now
subjoin
such
few
notes
on
the
druses
as
i
was
able
to
collect
during
my
short
stay
in
the
mountain
i
believe
them
to
be
authentic
because
i
was
very
careful
in
selecting
my
authourities
with
respect
to
the
true
religion
of
the
druses
none
but
a
learned
druse
can
satisfy
the
enquirer
curiosity
what
i
have
already
said
of
the
anzeyrys
is
equally
applicable
to
the
druses
their
religious
opinions
will
remain
for
ever
a
secret
unless
revealed
by
a
druse
their
customs
however
may
be
described
and
as
far
as
they
can
tend
to
elucidate
the
mystery
the
veil
may
be
drawn
aside
by
the
researches
of
the
traveller
it
seems
to
be
a
maxim
with
them
to
adopt
the
religious
practices
of
the
country
in
which
they
reside
and
to
profess
the
creed
of
the
strongest
hence
they
all
profess
islamism
in
syria
and
even
those
who
have
been
baptised
on
account
of
their
alliance
with
the
shehab
family
still
practise
the
exterior
forms
of
the
mohammedan
faith
there
is
no
truth
in
the
assertion
that
the
druses
go
one
day
to
the
mosque
and
the
next
to
the
church
they
all
profess
islamism
and
whenever
they
mix
with
mohammedans
they
perform
the
rites
prescribed
by
their
religion
in
private
however
they
break
the
fast
of
ramadhan
curse
mohammed
indulge
in
wine
and
eat
food
forbidden
by
the
koran
they
bear
an
inveterate
hatred
to
all
religions
except
their
own
but
more
particularly
to
that
of
the
franks
chiefly
in
consequence
of
a
tradition
current
among
them
that
the
europeans
will
one
day
overthrow
their
commonwealth
this
hatred
has
been
increased
since
the
invasion
of
the
french
and
the
most
unpardonable
insult
which
one
druse
can
offer
to
another
is
to
say
to
him
may
god
put
a
hat
on
you
allah
yelebesak
borneita
arabic
nothing
is
more
sacred
with
a
druse
than
his
public
reputation
he
will
overlook
an
insult
if
known
only
to
him
who
has
offered
it
and
will
put
up
with
blows
where
his
interest
is
concerned
provided
nobody
is
a
witness
but
the
slightest
abuse
given
in
public
he
revenges
with
the
greatest
fury
this
is
the
most
remarkable
feature
of
the
national
character
in
public
a
druse
may
appear
honourable
but
he
is
easily
tempted
to
a
contrary
behaviour
when
he
has
reason
to
think
that
his
conduct
will
remain
undiscovered
the
ties
of
blood
and
friendship
have
no
power
amongst
them
the
son
no
sooner
attains
the
years
of
maturity
than
he
begins
to
plot
against
his
father
examples
are
not
wanting
of
their
assailing
the
chastity
of
their
mothers
and
towards
their
sisters
such
conduct
is
so
frequent
that
a
father
never
allows
a
full
grown
son
to
remain
alone
with
any
of
the
females
of
his
family
their
own
religion
allows
them
to
take
their
sisters
in
marriage
but
they
are
restrained
from
indulging
in
this
connexion
on
account
of
its
repugnance
to
the
mohammedan
laws
a
druse
seldom
has
more
than
one
wife
but
he
divorces
her
under
the
slightest
pretext
and
it
is
a
custom
among
them
that
if
a
wife
asks
her
husband
permission
to
go
out
and
he
says
to
her
go
without
adding
and
come
back
she
is
thereby
divorced
nor
can
her
husband
recover
her
even
though
it
should
be
their
mutual
wish
till
she
is
married
again
according
to
the
turkish
forms
and
divorced
from
her
second
husband
it
is
known
that
the
druses
like
all
levantines
are
very
jealous
of
their
wives
adultery
however
is
rarely
punished
with
death
if
a
wife
is
detected
in
it
she
is
divorced
but
the
husband
is
afraid
to
kill
her
seducer
because
his
death
would
be
revenged
for
the
druses
are
inexorable
with
respect
to
the
law
of
retaliation
of
blood
they
know
too
that
if
the
affair
were
to
become
public
the
governor
would
ruin
both
parties
by
his
extortions
unnatural
propensities
are
very
common
amongst
them
the
akal
are
those
who
are
supposed
to
know
the
doctrines
of
the
druse
religion
they
superintend
divine
worship
in
the
chapels
or
as
they
are
called
khaloue
arabic
and
they
instruct
the
children
in
a
kind
of
catechism
they
are
obliged
to
abstain
from
swearing
and
all
abusive
language
and
dare
not
wear
any
article
of
gold
or
silk
in
their
dress
many
of
them
make
it
a
rule
never
to
eat
of
any
food
nor
to
receive
any
money
which
they
suspect
to
have
been
improperly
acquired
for
this
reason
whenever
they
have
to
receive
considerable
sums
of
money
they
take
care
that
it
shall
be
first
exchanged
for
other
coin
the
sheikh
el
nedjem
who
generally
accompanies
the
sheikh
beshir
in
his
visits
to
the
emir
never
tastes
food
in
the
palace
of
the
latter
nor
even
smokes
a
pipe
there
always
asserting
that
whatever
the
emir
possesses
has
been
unlawfully
obtained
there
are
different
degrees
of
akal
and
women
are
also
admitted
into
the
order
a
privilege
which
many
avail
themselves
of
from
parsimony
as
they
are
thus
exempted
from
wearing
the
expensive
and
rich
silks
fashionable
among
them
a
father
can
not
entirely
disinherit
his
son
in
that
case
his
will
would
be
set
aside
but
he
may
leave
him
a
single
mulberry
tree
for
his
portion
there
is
a
druse
kadhi
at
deir
el
kammar
who
judges
according
to
the
turkish
laws
and
the
customs
of
the
druses
his
office
is
hereditary
in
a
druse
family
but
he
is
held
in
little
repute
as
all
causes
of
importance
are
carried
before
the
emir
or
the
sheikh
beshir
the
druses
do
not
circumcise
their
children
circumcision
is
practised
only
in
the
mountain
by
those
members
of
the
shehab
family
who
continue
to
be
mohammedans
the
best
feature
in
the
druse
character
is
that
peculiar
law
of
hospitality
which
forbids
them
ever
to
betray
a
guest
i
made
particular
enquiries
on
this
subject
and
i
am
satisfied
that
no
consideration
of
interest
or
dread
of
power
will
induce
a
druse
to
give
up
a
person
who
has
once
placed
himself
under
his
protection
persons
from
all
parts
of
syria
are
in
the
constant
practice
of
taking
refuge
in
the
mountain
where
they
are
in
perfect
security
from
the
moment
they
enter
upon
the
emir
territory
should
the
prince
ever
be
tempted
by
large
offers
to
consent
to
give
up
a
refugee
the
whole
country
would
rise
to
prevent
such
a
stain
upon
their
national
reputation
the
mighty
djezzar
who
had
invested
his
own
creatures
with
the
government
of
the
mountain
never
could
force
them
to
give
up
a
single
individual
of
all
those
who
fled
thither
from
his
tyranny
whenever
he
became
very
urgent
in
his
demands
the
emir
informed
the
fugitive
of
his
danger
and
advised
him
to
conceal
himself
for
a
time
in
some
more
distant
part
of
his
territory
an
answer
was
then
returned
to
djezzar
that
the
object
of
his
resentment
had
fled
the
asylum
which
is
thus
afforded
by
the
mountain
is
one
of
the
greatest
advantages
that
the
inhabitants
of
syria
enjoy
over
those
in
the
other
parts
of
the
turkish
dominions
the
druses
are
extremely
fond
of
raw
meat
whenever
a
sheep
is
killed
the
raw
liver
heart
are
considered
dainties
the
christians
follow
their
example
but
with
the
addition
of
a
glass
of
brandy
with
every
slice
of
meat
in
many
parts
of
syria
i
have
seen
the
common
people
eat
raw
meat
in
their
favourite
dish
the
kobbes
the
women
especially
indulge
in
this
luxury
barker
told
me
that
during
his
two
years
residence
at
harissa
and
in
the
mountain
he
never
heard
any
kind
of
music
the
christians
are
too
devout
to
occupy
themselves
with
such
worldly
pleasures
and
the
druses
have
no
sort
of
musical
instruments
the
druses
have
a
few
historical
books
which
mention
their
nation
ibn
shebat
for
instance
as
i
was
told
gives
in
his
history
of
the
califes
that
of
the
druses
also
and
of
the
family
of
shehab
emir
haidar
a
relation
of
the
emir
beshir
has
lately
begun
to
compile
a
history
of
the
shehabs
which
already
forms
a
thick
quarto
volume
i
believe
that
the
greatest
amount
of
the
military
forces
of
the
druses
is
between
ten
and
fifteen
thousand
firelocks
the
christians
of
the
mountain
may
perhaps
be
double
that
number
but
i
conceive
that
the
most
potent
pasha
or
emir
would
never
be
able
to
collect
more
than
twenty
thousand
men
from
the
mountain
the
districts
inhabited
by
druses
in
the
pashalik

upwards
of
two

were
collected

the

assigned

them
convenient

some
of
them
retired
into
the
haouran
march
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
got
away
from
beteddein
the
emir
seemed
to
take
great
pleasure
in
conversing
with
me
as
we
spoke
in
arabic
which
made
him
much
freer
than
he
would
have
been
had
he
had
to
converse
through
the
medium
of
an
interpreter
he
wished
me
to
stay
a
few
days
longer
and
to
go
out
a
hunting
with
him
but
i
was
anxious
to
reach
damascus
and
feared
that
the
rain
and
snow
would
make
the
road
over
the
mountain
impassable
in
this
i
was
not
mistaken
having
afterwards
found
that
if
i
had
tarried
a
single
day
longer
i
should
have
been
obliged
to
return
along
the
great
road
by
the
way
of
beirout
the
emir
sent
one
of
his
horsemen
to
accompany

is
about
one
hour

conducted
a

the
road
ascends
the
steep
side
of
the
higher
region
of
the
mountain
called
djebel
barouk
we
were
an
hour
and
a
half
in
ascending
the
summit
was
covered
with
snow
and
a
thick
fog
rested
upon
it
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
footsteps
of
a
man
who
had
passed
a
few
hours
before
us
we
should
not
have
been
able
to
find
our
way
we
several
times
sunk
up
to
our
waists
in
the
snow
and
on
reaching
the
top
we
lost
the
footsteps
when
discovering
a
small
rivulet
running
beneath
the
snow
i
took
it
as
our
guide
and
although
the
druse
was
in
despair
and
insisted
on
returning
i
pushed
on
and
after
many
falls
reached
the
plain
of
the
bekaa
at
the
end
of
two
hours
from
the
summit
i
suppose
the
straight
road
to
be
not
more
than
an
hour
and
quarter
the
rivulet
by
which
we
descended
is
called
wady
dhobbye
arabic
we
had
no
sooner
entered
the
plain
than
it
began
to
snow
again
and
it
continued
to
rain
and
snow
for
several
days
small
caravans
djob
djennein
from
deir
el
kammar
to
damascus
pass
the
mountain
even
in
winter
but
to
prevent
the
sharp
hoofs
of
the
mules
from
sinking
deep
into
the
snow
the
muleteers
are
accustomed
in
the
difficult
places
to
spread
carpets
before
them
as
they
pass
we
reached
the
plain
near
a
small
village
inhabited
only
during
the
seed
time
from
thence
the
village
of
djob
djennein
bore
by
and
the
village
of
andjar
in
the
upper
part
of
the
bekaa
which
i
visited
in
the
year
from
zahle
from
the
foot
of
the
mountain
we
were
one
hour
in
reaching
the
bridge
over
the
liettani
which
has
been
lately
repaired
by
the
emir
beshir
who
has
also
built
a
khan
near
it
for
the
accommodation
of
travellers
at
twenty
minutes
from
the
bridge
lies
the
village
djob
djennein
arabic
one
of
the
principal
villages
of
the
bekaa
it
is
situated
on
the
declivity
of
the
where
that
mountain
begins
to
form
part
of
the
djebel
essheikh
the
libanus
here
advances
a
little
into
the
valley
which
from
thence
takes
a
more
western
course
the
emir
beshir
has
seven
or
eight
villages
about
djob
djennein
which
together
with
the
latter
are
his
own
property
but
the
whole
bekaa
since
soleiman
succeeded
to
the
pashalik
of
damascus
in
is
also
under
his
command
the
villages
to

having
one
of
the
emir
beshir
men
with
me
i
was
treated
like
a
great
man
in
the
house
of
the
sheikh
of
djob
djennein
this
i
may
be
allowed
to
mention
as
it
is
the
only
instance
of
my
receiving
such
honours
during
my
travels
in
syria
khan
doumas
march
caravans
reckon
two
days
journey
between
djob
djennein
and
damascus
but
as
i
was
tolerably
well
mounted
and
my
guide
was
on
a
good
mare
of
the
emir
beshir
i
resolved
on
reaching
it
in
one
day
we
therefore
pursued
our
route
at
a
brisk
walk
and
sometimes
at
a
trot
we
crossed
the
plain
obliquely
having
the
projection
of
the
which
ends
at
djob
djennein
on
our
right
at
minutes
from
djob
djennein
to
the
right
is
the
village
kamel
el
louz
arabic
where
are
many
ancient
caves
in
the
rocky
mountain
which
rises
behind
it
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
libanus
on
the
summit
of
the
mountain
on
our
left
i
observed
a
singular
rock
called
shekeik
el
donia
arabic
or
hadjar
el
konttara
arabic
my
guide
told
me
that
the
time
would
certainly
arrive
when
some
frank
nation
would
invade
this
country
and
that
on
reaching
this
rock
they
would
be
completely
routed
after
a
short
ascent
the
road
lies
through
a
narrow
plain
and
then
up
another
wady
in
the
midst
of
which
is
the
village
of
ayty
arabic
two
hours
distant
from
djob
djennein
it
belongs
to
sheikh
hassan
the
brother
of
sheikh
beshir
a
very
rich
druse
who
is
as
avaricious
as
the
latter
is
generous
he
has
however
built
a
khan
here
for
the
accommodation
of
travellers
there
is
a
fine
spring
in
the
village
the
inhabitants
manufacture
coarse
earthen
ware
arabic
with
which
they
supply
damascus
at
the
end
of
two
hours
and
three
quarters
we
reached
the
summit
of
the
where
the
heavy
rains
had
already
melted
the
greater
part
of
the
snow
here
are
some
stunted
oaks
and
numerous
springs
in
three
hours
and
a
quarter
we
descended
into
a
fine
plain
watered
by
the
wady
halloue
arabic
which
we
followed
into
a
narrow
valley
and
on
issuing
from
it
passed
a
ruined
khan
with
a
spring
called
khan
doumas
arabic
which
is
five
hours
and
a
quarter
from
djob
djennein
we
left
the
plain
of
damascus
village
doumas
which
is
half
an
hour
from
the
khan
on
our
right
and
at
the
end
of
six
hours
reached
a
high
uneven
plain
situated
between
the
anti
libanus
and
the
chain
of
hills
which
commence
near
katana
the
plain
is
called
szakhret
el
sham
arabic
seven
hours
and
a
half
the
ruined
khan
meylesoun
arabic
eight
hours
and
a
half
brought
us
to
the
termination
of
the
szakhret
from
which
we
descended
into
the
ghouta
or
plain
of
damascus
at
nine
hours
the
village
mezze
arabic
among
the
gardens
of
damascus
and
at
the
end
of
nine
hours
and
three
quarters
we
entered
the
city
which
is
generally
reckoned
fourteen
hours
journey
from
djob
djennein
note
between
kesrouan
and
zahle
i
am
informed
that
in
the
mountain
about
six
hours
from
the
latter
are
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
city
called
fakkra
or
mezza
large
blocks
of
stone
some
remains
of
temples
and
several
greek
inscriptions
are
seen
there
between
akoura
and
baalbec
is
a
road
cut
in
the
rock
with
several
long
greek
inscriptions
and
near
the
source
of
the
rivulet
of
afka
near
akoura
are
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
building
which
i
unfortunately
did
not
see
during
my
passage
through
that
village
in
although
i
enquired
for
them
journal
of
a
tour
from
damascus
into
the
haouran
and
the
mountains
to
the
and
of
the
lake
of
tiberias
in
the
months
of
april
and
may
in
returning
to
damascus
it
was
my
intention
to
obtain
some
further
knowledge
of
the
haouran
and
to
extend
my
journey
over
the
mountains
to
the
south
of
damascus
where
i
wished
to
explore
the
ruins
of
djerash
gerasa
and
of
amman
philadelphia
in
the
ancient
decapolis
which
seetzen
had
discovered
in
his
journey
from
damascus
to
jerusalem
an
unexpected
change
in
the
government
of
damascus
obliged
me
to
protract
my
stay
in
that
city
for
nearly
a
month
the
news
had
just
been
received
of
the
dismissal
of
soleiman
pasha
and
it
was
necessary
for
me
before
i
set
off
to
ascertain
whether
the
country
would
yield
quietly
to
the
command
of
the
new
pasha
for
if
rebel
parties
started
up
and
submission
became
doubtful
the
traveller
would
run
great
hazards
would
be
unable
to
derive
any
advantage
from
the
protection
of
the
government
and
would
be
obliged
to
force
his
way
by
the
means
of
endless
presents
to
the
provincial
chiefs
as
soon
as
i
was
satisfied
of
the
tranquil
state
of
the
pashalik
i
set
out
for
the
haouran
i
took
with
me
a
damascene
who
had
been
seventeen
times
to
mekka
who
was
well
acquainted
with
the
deir
ali
bedouins
inured
to
fatigue
and
not
indisposed
to
favour
my
pursuits
i
had
indeed
reason
to
be
contented
with
my
choice
of
this
man
though
he
was
of
little
further
use
to
me
than
to
take
care
of
my
horse
and
to
assist
in
intimidating
the
arabs
by
some
additional
arms
we
left
damascus
on
the
morning
of
the
of
april
and
as
my
first
steps
were
directed
towards
those
parts
of
the
ledja
which
i
had
not
visited
during
my
first
tour
we
took
the
road
of
el
kessoue
deir
ali
and
el
merdjan
to
the
description
of
which
in
my
former
journal
i
may
here
add
the
following
particulars
the
part
of
djebel
kessoue
is
called
djebel
aadelye
arabic
from
kessoue
our
road
bore
in
one
hour
and
a
quarter
from
that
place
we
passed
the
small
village
called
haush
el
madjedye
arabic
haush
being
an
appellation
applied
to
small
villages
enclosed
by
a
wall
or
rather
to
those
whose
houses
join
so
as
to
present
by
their
junction
a
defence
against
the
arab
robbers
the
entrance
to
the
haush
is
generally
through
a
strong
wooden
gate
which
is
carefully
secured
every
evening
at
an
hour
and
three
quarters
from
kessoue
is
deir
ali
to
the
north
of
which
upon
the
summit
of
djebel
kessoue
is
situated
the
mezar
el
khaledye
arabic
deir
ali
is
a
village
inhabited
by
druses
who
keep
the
arabs
in
great
awe
by
the
reputation
for
courage
which
they
have
acquired
upon
many
occasions
it
seems
rather
extraordinary
that
the
druses
the
known
enemies
of
the
mohammedan
faith
should
be
allowed
to
inhabit
the
country
so
near
to
the
gate
of
the
holy
city
as
damascus
is
called
for
not
only
deir
ali
but
three
or
four
villages
as
artous
esshera
fye
and
others
at
only
three
hours
distant
from
damascus
are
for
the
greater
part
peopled
by
them
numbers
of
them
are
even
settled
in
the
town
the
quarters
called
bab
mesalla
and
el
hakle
in
the
meidhan
or
suburbs
of
the
city
contain
merdjan
more
than
one
hundred
druse
families
who
are
there
called
teyamene
arabic
in
another
quarter
called
el
khereb
live
three
or
four
hundred
metaweli
families
or
shiytes
of
the
sect
of
aly
of
this
sect
is
the
present
mutsellim
aly
aga
the
religious
creeds
of
all
these
people
are
publicly
known
but
the
fanatism
of
the
damascenes
however
violent
is
easily
made
subservient
to
their
fears
or
interests
every
religious
and
moral
duty
being
forgotten
when
the
prospect
of
gain
or
the
apprehension
of
danger
presents
itself
at
three
hours
and
a
quarter
from
kessoue
is
the
village
el
merdjan
when
i
passed
this
place
in
i
found
a
single
christian
family
in
it
i
now
found
eight
or
ten
families
most
of
them
druses
who
had
emigrated
hither
from
shaara
a
well
peopled
village
in
but
now
deserted
they
had
brought
the
fertile
soil
round
el
merdjan
into
cultivation
and
had
this
year
sown
eight
ghararas
of
wheat
and
barley
or
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
cwt
english
the
gharara
of
damascus
is
eighty
muds
at
three
and
a
half
rotola
per
mud
or
twenty
pounds
the
taxes
paid
by
the
village
amounted
to
a
thousand
piastres
or
fifty
pounds
sterling
besides
the
tribute
extorted
by
the
bedouins
the
vicinity
of
the
village
is
watered
by
several
springs
i
was
obliged
to
remain
at
merdjan
the
next
day
because
my
mare
fell
ill
and
was
unable
to
proceed
as
i
did
not
like
to
return
to
damascus
i
bought
a
mare
of
the
sheikh
of
the
village
a
christian
of
mount
libanus
who
knew
me
and
who
took
a
bill
upon
damascus
in
payment
this
mare
i
afterwards
bartered
for
a
bedouin
horse
april
i
left
merdjan
to
examine
the
eastern
limits
of
the
ledja
we
passed
the
aamoud
eszoubh
arabic
or
column
of
the
morning
an
insulated
pillar
standing
in
the
plain
it
is
formed
berak
of
the
black
stone
of
the
ledja
about
or
thirty
feet
high
of
the
ionic
order
and
with
a
high
pedestal
i
had
been
told
that
there
were
some
inscriptions
upon
it
but
i
did
not
find
any
the
column
is
half
an
hour
distant
from
merdjan
to
the
eastward
of
south
round
the
column
are
fragments
of
three
or
four
others
which
appear
to
have
formed
a
small
temple
the
remains
of
a
subterraneous
aqueduct
extending
from
the
village
towards
the
spot
where
the
column
stands
are
yet
visible
in
one
hour
from
thence
we
passed
a
ruined
village
called
beidhan
arabic
with
a
saltpetre
manufactory
two
hours
from
merdjan
is
berak
arabic
bearing
from
it
our
road
lay
over
a
low
plain
between
the
djebel
kessoue
and
the
ledja
in
which
the
bedouins
of
the
latter
were
pasturing
their
cattle
berak
is
a
ruined
town
situated
on
the
corner
of
the
ledja
there
is
no
large
building
of
any
consequence
here
but
there
are
many
private
habitations
here
are
two
saltpetre
manufactories
in
which
the
saltpetre
is
procured
by
boiling
the
earth
dug
up
among
the
ruins
of
the
town
saline
earth
is
also
dug
up
in
the
neighbouring
plain
in
finding
the
productive
spots
they
are
guided
by
the
appearance
of
the
ground
in
the
morning
before
sunrise
and
wherever
it
then
appears
most
wet
with
dew
the
soil
beneath
is
found
impregnated
with
salt

in

we
reached
om

arabic
a
village
inhabited
by
druses
the
advantages
of
a
wady
like
the

are
incalculable
in
these
countries
where
we
always
find
that
cultivation
follows
the
direction
of
the
winter
torrents
as
it
follows
the
nile
in
egypt
there
are
not
many
wadys
in
this
country
which
inundate
the
land
but
the
inhabitants
make
the
best
use
of
the
water
to
irrigate
their
fields
after
the
great
rains
have
ceased
springs
are
scarce
and
it
is
from
the
wadys
that
the
reservoirs
are
filled
which
supply
both
men
and
cattle
with
water
till
the
return
of
the
rainy
season
it
is
from
the
numerous
wadys
which
rise
in

that
the

of

derives
its
means
of
existence
and
the
success
of
its
agriculture
om
ezzeitoun
is
inhabited
by
thirty
or
forty
families
it
appears
by
the
extent
of
its
ruins
to
have
been
formerly
a
town
of
some
note
i
here
copied
several
inscriptions
upon

broken

in
the
wall
of
a
public
building
over
the
great

of
the

was
the
following
greek
greek
the
only
ancient
building
of

an

of

only
remain
on

near

greek
i
had
intended
to
sleep
at
om
ezzeitoun
but
i
found
the
druses
very
towards
me
it
was
generally
reported
that
i
had
discovered
a
treasure
in
at
shohba
near
this
place
and
it
was
supposed
that
i
had
now
returned
to
carry
off
what
i
had
then
left
behind
i
had
to
combat
against
this
story
at
almost
every
place
but
i
was
nowhere
so
rudely
received
as
at
this
village
where
i
escaped
ill
treatment
only
by
assuming
a
very
imposing
air
and
threatening
with
many
oaths
that
if
i
lost
a
single
hair
of
my
beard
the
pasha
would
levy
an
avania
of
many
purses
on
the
village
i
had
with
me
an
old
passport
from
soleiman
pasha
who
though
no
longer
governor
of
damascus
had
been
charged
pro
tempore
with
the
government
till
the
arrival
of
the
new
pasha
who
was
expected
from
constantinople
soleiman
had
retired
to
his
former
government
at
acre
but
his
mutsellim
at
damascus
very
kindly
granted
me
strong
letters
of
recommendation
to
all
the
authorities
of
the
country
which
were
of
great
use
to
me
in
the
course
of
my
journey
i
left
om
ezzeitoun
late
in
the
evening
to
proceed
toward
the
mountain
of
haouran
our
road
lay
on
the
side
of
tel
shiehhan
bereit
close
to
which
runs
the
ledja
and
the
wady
lowa
descends
the
mountain
on
the
west
side
of
it
we
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
soueida
and
in
an
hour
and
a
quarter
from
the
village
stopped
after
sunset
at
an
encampment
of
the
djebel
haouran
arabs
my
companion
and
a
guide
whom
i
had
engaged
at
om
ezzeitoun
persuaded
me
to
appear
before
the
arabs
as
a
soldier
belonging
to
the
government
in
order
to
get
a
good
supper
of
which
we
were
in
great
want
that
of
the
preceding
night
at
the
saltpetre
works
having
consisted
of
only
a
handful
of
dry
biscuit
we
were
served
with
a
dish
of
rice
boiled
in
sour
milk
and
were
much
amused
by
the
sports
and
songs
of
the
young
girls
of
the
tribe
which
they
continued
in
the
moonlight
till
near
midnight
one
of
the
young
men
had
just
returned
to
the
encampment
who
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
the
aeneze
during
a
nightly
predatory
expedition
he
showed
us
the
marks
of
his
fetters
and
enlarged
upon
the
mode
of
treating
the
rabiat
or
prisoner
among
the
aeneze
a
friend
had
paid
thirty
camels
for
his
liberation
in
spring
the
arabs
of
the
djebel
haouran
and
the
ledja
take
advantage
of
the
approach
of
the
aeneze
to
plunder
daily
among
their
enemies
they
are
better
acquainted
with
the
ground
than
the
latter
a
part
of
whose
horses
and
cattle
are
every
spring
carried
off
by
these
daring
mountaineers
april
at
half
an
hour
from
the
encampment
is
the
hill
called
tel
dobbe
arabic
consisting
of
a
heap
of
ruins
with
a
spring
to
the
of
it
a
quarter
of
an
hour
is
the
ruined
village
of
bereit
which
was
inhabited
in
but
is
now
abandoned
the
haouran
peasants
wander
from
one
village
to
another
in
all
of
them
they
find
commodious
habitations
in
the
ancient
houses
a
camel
transports
their
family
and
baggage
and
as
they
are
not
tied
to
any
particular
spot
by
private
landed
property
or
plantations
and
find
every
where
large
tracts
to
cultivate
aatyl
they
feel
no
repugnance
at
quitting
the
place
of
their
birth
in
one
hour
we
passed
seleim
which
in
was
inhabited
by
a
few
poor
druses
but
is
now
abandoned
here
are
the
ruins
of
a
temple
built
with
much
smaller
stones
than
any
i
had
observed
in
the
construction
of
buildings
of
a
similar
size
in
the
haouran
on
the
four
outer
corners
were
corinthian
pilasters
at
one
hour
and
a
quarter
road
we
entered
the
wood
of
which
is
continued
along
the
western
declivity
of
the
djebel
one
hour
and
a
half
in
the
wood
we
passed
the
wady
dyab
arabic
coming
from
the
mountain
one
hour
and
three
quarters
passed
wady
kefr
el
laha
arabic
at
the
end
of
two
hours
we
reached
aatyl
arabic
a
small
druse
village
in
the
midst
of
the
wood
here
are
the
remains
of
two
handsome
temples
that
which
is
on
the
side
is
in
complete
ruins
it
consisted
of
a
square
building
with
a
high
arch
across
its
roof
two
niches
were
on
each
side
of
the
gate
and
in
front
of
it
a
portico
of
columns
the
number
of
which
it
is
impossible
to
determine
the
ground
being
covered
by
a
heap
of
fragments
of
columns
architraves
and
large
square
stones
this
temple
is
called
el
kaszr
from
a
small
stone
in
its
precincts
i
copied
the
following
letters
greek
on
the
outside
wall
of
the
temple
is
the
following
inscription
in
remarkably
fine
characters
greek
on
the
side
of
aatyl
stands
the
other
temple
which
is
of
small
dimensions
but
of
elegant
construction
it
has
a
portico
of
two
columns
and
two
pilasters
each
of
which
has
a
projecting
base
for
a
statue
elevated
from
the
ground
about
of
the
height
of
the
column
like
the
pillars
of
the
great
colonnade
at
palmyra
the
columns
are
corinthian
but
not
of
the
best
time
of
that
order
the
interior
of
the
temple
consists
of
an
apartment
with
several
arches
without
any
ornaments
but
the
gate
is
covered
with
sculpture
the
two
pilasters
forming
the
portico
have
inscriptions
on
their
bases
on
the
one
is
this
greek
near
the
other
pilaster
is
an
inscription
upon
two
broken
stones
lying
near
each
other
these
stones
appear
to
have
been
formerly
joined
and
to
have
formed
part
of
the
base
of
the
pilaster
and
the
inscription
seems
to
have
been
a
copy
of
the
former
upon
the
one
i
read
greek
and
upon
the
other
greek
greek
near
the
temple
i
saw
a
about
ten
inches
square
representing
a
female
bust
with
hair
in
ringlets
falling
upon
the
shoulders
it
was
lying
on
the
ground
but
it
was
not
of
such
workmanship
as
to
tempt
me
to
take
it
with
me
upon
the
wall
of
one
of
the
largest
houses
in
the
village
was
a
long
inscription
but
too
high
for
me
to
read
of
aatyl
about
one
hour
up
in
the
mountain
is
a
ruined
tower
called
berdj
mabroum
arabic
the
tobacco
of
aatyl
is
preferred
to
that
of
any
other
part
of
the
haouran
i
here
saw
a
public
woman
a
kahirene
who
seemed
to
be
kept
at
the
expense
of
the
whole
village
i
was
surprised
at
this
for
manners
in
the
haouran
are
generally
almost
as
pure
as
among
the
bedouins
public
women
are
not
suffered
and
adultery
is
punished
by
the
death
of
the
woman
while
the
man
is
ruined
by
the
heavy
penalties
exacted
by
the
government
in
expiation
of
his
guilt
last
year
a
married
turkish
woman
at
mohadje
a
village
in
the
loehf
was
caught
in
the
embraces
of
a
young
christian
her
three
brothers
hastened
to
the
spot
dragged
her
to
the
market
place
and
there
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
community
cut
her
in
pieces
with
their
swords
loading
her
at
the
same
time
with
the
most
horrible
imprecations
the
lover
was
fined
ten
purses
from
aatyl
i
pursued
my
way
one
hour
and
a
quarter
to
soueida
at
a
short
distance
from
which
are
the
remains
of
an
ancient
road
as
i
had
examined
the
antiquities
of
this
village
in
and
did
not
wish
to
be
seen
here
a
second
time
i
passed
on
without
stopping
in
the
direction
of
aaere
which
is
two
hours
and
a
half
distant
in
a
direction
in
the
plain
and
at
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
the
west
of

is
the
ruined

there
is
only
a
small
kurdine
village
in

road
between
soueida
and
aaere
april
i
remained
this
day
at
aaere
in
the
house
of
the
druse
chief
the
sheikh
shybely
ibn
hamdan
where
i
alighted
the
sheikh
appeared
to
be
greatly
pleased
at
my
reappearance
since
my
former
visit
i
had
cultivated
his
friendship
by
letters
and
presents
which
i
had
sent
to
him
from
aleppo
and
by
which
he
was
so
much
gratified
that
he
would
have
loaded
me
with
presents
in
return
had
i
not
thought
proper
to
decline
every
thing
of
that
kind
contenting
myself
with
some
very
strong
letters
of
recommendation
from
him
to
the
authorities
in
those
places
which
i
intended
to
visit
shybely
is
the
kindest
and
most
generous
turk
i
have
known
in
syria
and
his
reputation
for
these
qualities
has
become
so
general
that
peasants
from
all
parts
of
the
haouran
settle
in
his
village
the
whole
of
the
christian
community
of
soueida
with
the
greek
priest
at
their
head
had
lately
arrived
so
that
aaere
has
now
become
one
of
the
most
populous
villages
in
this
district
the
high
estimation
in
which
the
sheikh
is
held
arises
from
his
great
hospitality
and
the
justice
and
mildness
with
which
he
treats
the
peasants
upwards
of
forty
of
whom
he
feeds
daily
besides
strangers
who
are
continually
passing
here
in
their
way
to
the
bedouin
encampments
the
coffee
pot
is
always
boiling
in
the
menzoul
or
stranger
room
he
may
now
in
fact
be
called
the
druse
chief
of
the
haouran
though
that
title
belongs
in
strictness
to
his
hossein
ibn
hamdan
the
sheikh
of
soueida
in
the
mosque
of
aaere
a
low
vaulted
building
i
copied
the
following
inscription
from
a
stone
in

greek
boszra
april
i
now
thought
that
i
might
visit
boszra
which
i
had
found
it
prudent
to
avoid
in
my
former
tour
shybely
gave
me
one
of
his
men
as
a
guide
and
we
followed
the
road
which
i
have
already
described
as
far
as
shmerrin
at
a
quarter
of
an
hour
beyond
shmerrin
we
passed

boszra
arabic
is
situated
in
the
open
plain
two
hours
distant
from
aaere
and
is
at
present
the
last
inhabited
place
in
the
extremity
of
the
haouran
it
was
formerly
the
capital
of
arabia
provincia
and
is
now
including
its
ruins
the
largest
town
in
the
haouran
it
is
of
an
oval
shape
its
greatest
length
being
from
to
its
circumference
is
three
quarters
of
an
hour
it
was
anciently
enclosed
by
a
thick
wall
which
gave
it
the
reputation
of
a
place
of
great
strength
many
parts
of
this
wall
especially
on
the
side
still
remain
it
was
constructed
with
stones
of
a
moderate
size
strongly
cemented
together
the
principal
buildings
in
boszra
were
on
the
side
and
in
a
direction
from
thence
towards
the
middle
of
the
town
the
and
quarters
are
covered
with
ruins
of
private
dwellings
the
walls
of
many
of
which
are
still
standing
but
most
of
the
roofs
have
fallen
in
the
style
of
building
seems
to
have
been
similar
to
that
observed
in
all
the
other
ancient
towns
of
the
haouran
on
the
side
are
springs
of
fresh
water
of
which
i
counted
five
beyond
the
precincts
of
the
town
and
six
within
the
walls
their
waters
unite
with
a
rivulet
whose
source
is
on
the
side
within
the
town
and
which
loses
itself
in
the
southern
plain
at
several
hours
distance
it
is
called
by
the
arabs

which
in
most
maps
and
even
by
is
laid
down
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of

is
unknown
to
the
natives
but
i
was
afterwards
informed
that
there
is
a
wady
ghazel
in
the
direction
of
amman

in
the
djebel
belka
which
descends
from

eastern
plains
to
the
of

the
principal
ruins
of
boszra
are
the
following
a
square
building
which
within
is
circular
and
has
many
arches
and
niches
in
the

on
either
side
of
the

within
are
two
larger
niches
and
opposite
to
the

is
the
sanctuary
formed
of
low
arches
supported
by
corinthian
pillars
without
pedestals
several
beautiful
sculptured
friezes
are
inserted
in
the
wall
but
i
was
unable
to
discover
from
whence
they
had
been
taken
in

the
diameter
of
the
rotunda
is
four

its
roof
has
fallen

are
entire
without

it
appears
to
have
been
a

a
long

it
was
illegible
to
my
sight
at

the

have
given
to
this

the
name
of

or
the
house
of
boheiry
this
boheiry
is
a
personage
well
known
to
the
biographers
of
mohammed
and
many
strange
stories
are
related
of
him
by
the
mohammedans
in
honour
of
their
prophet
or
by
the
eastern
christians
in
derision
of
the
impostor
he
is
said
to
have
been
a
rich
greek
priest
settled
at
boszra
and
to
have
predicted
the
prophetic
vocation
of
mohammed
whom
he
saw
when
a
boy
passing
with
a
caravan
from
mekka
to
damascus
abou
el
feradj
one
of
the
earliest
arabic
historians
relates
this
anecdote
according
to
the
traditions
of
the
christians
he
was
a
confidential
counsellor
of
mohammed
in
the
compilation
of
the
koran
to
the
west
of
the
abovementioned
buildings
stands
the
great
mosque
of
boszra
which
is
certainly
coeval
with
the
first
aera
of
mohammedanism
and
is
commonly
ascribed
to
omar
el
khattab
arabic
part
of
its
roof
has
fallen
in
on
two
sides
of
the
square
building
runs
a
double
row
of
columns
transported
hither
from
the
ruins
of
some
christian
temple
in
the
town
those
which
are
formed
of
the
common
haouran
stone
are
badly
wrought
in
the
coarse
heavy
style
of
the
lower
empire
but
among
them
are
sixteen
fine
variegated
marble
columns
distinguished
both
by
the
beauty
of
the
material
and
of
the
execution
fourteen
are
corinthian
and
two
ionic
they
are
each
about
sixteen
or
eighteen
feet
in
height
of
a
single
block
and
well
polished
upon
two
of
them
standing
opposite
to
each

are
the
two
following
inscriptions
greek
greek
greek
the
walls
of
the
mosque
are
covered
with
a
coat
of
fine
plaster
upon
which
were
many
cufic
inscriptions
in
running
all
round
the
wall
which
was
embellished
also
by
numerous
elegant
arabesque
ornaments
a
few
traces
of
these
as
well
as
of
the
inscriptions
still
remain
the
interior
of
the
mosque
is
covered
with
the
ruins
of
the
roof
and
with
fragments
of
columns
among
which
i
observed
a
broken
shaft
of
an
octagonal
pillar
two
feet
in
diameter
there
are
also
several
stones
with
cufic
inscriptions
upon
them
passing
from
the
great
mosque
southwards
we
came
to
the
principal
ruin
of
boszra
the
remains
of
a
temple
situated
on
the
side
of
a
long
street
which
runs
across
the
whole
town
and
terminates
at
the
western
gate
of
this
temple
nothing
remains
but
the
back
wall
with
two
pilasters
and
a
column
joined
by
its
entablature
to
the
main
wall
they
are
all
of
the
corinthian
order
and
both
capitals
and
architraves
are
richly
adorned
with
sculpture
in
the
wall
of
the
temple
are
three
rows
of
niches
one
over
the
other
behind
this
is
another
wall
half
ruined
in
front
of
the
temple
but
standing
in
an
oblique
direction
towards
it
are
four
large
corinthian
columns
equalling
in
beauty
of
execution
the
finest
of
those
at
baalbec
or
palmyra
those
in
the
temple
of
the
sun
at
the
latter
place
excepted
they
are
quite
perfect
are
six
spans
in
diameter
and
somewhat
more
than
feet
in
height
they
are
composed
of
many
pieces
of
different
sizes
the
smallest
being
towards
the
top
and
they
do
not
appear
to
have
been
united
by
an
entablature
they
are
not
at
equal
distances
the
space
between
the
two
middle
ones
being
greater
than
the
two
other
intervals
about
thirty
paces
distant
stands
another
column
of
smaller
dimensions
and
of
more
elaborate
but
less
elegant
execution
i
endeavoured
in
vain
to
trace
the
plan
of
the
edifice
to
which
these
columns
belonged
for
they
correspond
in
no
way
with
the
neighbouring
temple
it
appeared
that
the
main
building
had
been
destroyed
and
its
site
built
upon
nothing
whatever
of
it
remaining
but
these
columns
the
immediate
vicinity
of
which
is
covered
with
the
ruins
of
private
houses
these
four
large
columns
and
those
of
kanouat
are
the
finest
remains
of
antiquity
in
the
haouran
upon
the
base
of
the
pilaster
in
the
back
wall
of
the
temple
is
the
following
inscription
in
handsome
characters
greek
upon
a
broken
stone
in
a
modern
wall
near
this
temple
i
read
greek
upon
another
broken
stone
not
far
from
the
former
is
this
inscription
now
almost
effaced
and
which
i
made
out
with
difficulty
greek
the
ruin
of
the
temple
just
described
is
in
the
upper
part
of
the
town
which
slopes
gently
towards
the
west
not
far
from
it
in
descending
the
principal
street
is
a
triumphal
arch
almost
entire
but
presenting
nothing
very
striking
in
its
appearance
from
the
circumstance
of
the
approach
to
it
being
choked
with
private
houses
as
is
the
case
with
all
the
public
buildings
in
boszra
except
the
church
first
mentioned
the
arch
consists
of
a
high
central
arch
with
two
lower
side
arches
between
these
are
corinthian
pilasters
with
projecting
bases
for
statues
on
the
inside
of
the
arch
were
several
large
niches
now
choked
up
by
heaps
of

in
its
is
a
stone
covered
with
a
long
and
beautiful
cufic
inscription
which
is
well
worth
transporting
to
europe
the
characters
being
very
small
it
would
have
required
a
whole
day
to
copy
it
it
begins
as
follows
arabic
not
far
from
the
great
mosque
is
another
triumphal
arch
of
smaller
dimensions
than
the
former
but
remarkable
for
the
thickness
of
its
walls
it
forms
the
entrance
to
an
arched
passage
through
which
one
of
the
principal
streets
passed
two
doric
columns
are
standing
before
it
in
the

almost
perfect
one
hundred

ninety

one
hundred

fifty
three
in

and
enclosed
by
a

seven
feet

built
of

its
depth
maybe
about
twenty
feet
a
staircase
leads
down
to
the

this
reservoir

a
work
of

saracens
made
for
watering
the

as
late
as
the
seventeenth

flanked
by
a
row
of

by
some
public
edifices

west
side
by
an
ancient
cemetery
the
other
sides
are
open
upon
a
broken
stone
in
the
middle
of

is
the
following
inscription
in
characters
similar
to
those
which
i
met
with
at
hebron
kanouat
and
aaere
xxxxx
i
now
quitted
the
precincts
of
the
town
and
just
beyond
the
walls
on
the
side
came
to
a
large
castle
of
saracen
origin
probably
of
the
time
of
the
crusades
it
is
one
of
the
best
built
castles
in
syria
and
is
surrounded
by
a
deep
ditch
its
walls
are
very
thick
and
in
the
interior
are
alleys
dark
vaults
subterraneous
passages
of
the
most
solid
construction
what
distinguishes
it
from
other
syrian
castles
is
that
on
the
top
of
it
there
is
a
gallery
of
short
pillars
on
three
sides
and
on
the
fourth
side
are
several
niches
in
the
wall
without
any
decorations
many
of
the
pillars
are
still
standing
the
castle
was
garrisoned
at
the
time
of
my
visit
by
six
moggrebyns
only
there
is
a
well
in
the
interior
i
copied
the
following

a
small
stone
lying
on
the
ground
within
the
castle
greek
legionis

the
castle
of
boszra
is
a
most
important
post
to
protect
the
harvests
of
the
haouran
against
the
hungry
bedouins
but
it
is
much
neglected
by
the
pashas
of
damascus
and
this
year
the
crops
of
the
inhabitants
of
boszra
have
been
almost
entirely
consumed
by
the
horses
of
the
aeneze
who
were
encamped
on
the
side
of
the
djebel
haouran
from
a
broken
stone
in
the
modern
wall
of
a
near
the
castle
i
copied
the
following
letters
greek
in
proceeding
from
the
castle
westwards
i
arrived
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at

of
the
town
where
the
long
street
terminates
the
gate
is
a
fine
arch
with
niches
on
each
side
in
perfect
preservation
the
people
of
boszra
call
it
bab
el
haoua
arabic
or
the
wind
gate
probably
because
the
prevailing
or
summer
breezes
blow
from
that
point
a
broad
paved
causeway
of
which
some
traces
yet
remain
led
into
the
town
vestiges
of
the
ancient
pavement
are
also
seen
in
many
of
the
streets
with
a
paved
footway
on
each
side
but
the
streets
are
all
narrow
just
permitting
a
loaded

near
the
bab

are
the

above
mentioned
called
ayoun

with
some
remains
of

near
them
the

built
here
a
small
or
barrack
for
thirty
men
to
keep
the
hostile
arabs
at
a
distance
from

the
town
walls
are
almost
perfect

there
is
no

i

its

principally
on

are
commemorated

of

not
a
vestige
remains
there
is
scarcely
a

in

the
twelve

families
who
now
inhabit

cultivate
nothing

wheat
barley

a
little
dhourra
a
number
of
fine
rose
trees
grow
wild
among
the
ruins
of
the
town
and
were
just
beginning
to
open
their
buds
april
i
was
greatly
annoyed
during
my
stay
at
boszra
by
the
curiosity
of
the
aeneze
who
were
continually
passing
through
the
place
it
had
been
my
wish
to
visit
the
ruined
city
of
om
el
djemal
arabic
which
is
eight
hours
distant
from
boszra
to
the
but
the
demands
of
the
arabs
for
conducting
me
thither
were
so
exorbitant
exceeding
even
the
sum
which
i
had
thought
necessary
to
bring
with
me
from
damascus
to
defray
the
expenses
of
my
whole
journey
that
i
was
obliged
to
return
to
aaere
towards
after
having
offered
thirty
piastres
for
a
guide
which
no
one
would
accept
none
but
aeneze
could
have
served
me
and
with
them
there
was
no
reasoning
they
believed
that
i
was
going
in
search
of
treasure
and
that
i
should
willingly
give
any
sum
to
reach
the
spot
where
it
was
hid
april
i
took
leave
of
my
worthy
friend
shybely
who
would
not
let
us
depart
alone
but
engaged
a
bedouin
to
accompany
us
towards
the
western
parts
of
the
haouran
this
man
was
a
bedouin
of
sayd
or
upper

had
been
with
one
of
them
to
mekka
from
whence
he
returned
to
damascus
where
he
entered
into
the
pasha
cavalry
here
he
had
the
misfortune
to
kill
one
of
his
comrades
which
el
hereyek
obliging
him
to
fly
he
repaired
to
the
aeneze
with
whom
he
found
security

protection

in

are
several

which
are
filled
either
by

water
which
is
conducted
into

from
every
side
by
narrow
channels
they
are
all
of
ancient
date
and
built
entirely
with
the
black
haouran
stone
but
i
saw
in
none
of
the
villages
any
edifice
of
magnitude
near
hereyek
we
fell
in
with
the
encampment
of
the
damascus
beggars
who
make
an
excursion
every
spring
to
the
haouran
to
collect
alms
from
the
peasants
and
arabs
these
contributions
are
principally
in
butter
and
wool
naeme
which
they
sell
on
their
return
to
damascus
they
had
about
a
dozen
tents
and
as
many
asses
and
i
saw
a
good
mare
tied
before
the
tent
of
the
sheikh
who
is
a
man
of
consequence
among
the
thieves
and
vagabonds
of
damascus
his
name
is
el
shuhadein
arabic
he
invited
us
to
drink
a
cup
of
coffee
and
take
some
refreshment
but
my
companions
who
knew
him
advised
me
to
keep
clear
of
him
at
six
hours
and
a
quarter
we
passed
at
a
short
distance
to
our
left
the
village
olma
arabic
our
route
being
about
one
hour
of
olma
lies
the
village
el
kerek
eight
hours
and
minutes
the
village
naeme
arabic
most
of
these
villages
stand
upon
or
near
low
hillocks
or
tels
the
only
objects
which
break
the
monotony
of
the
plain
it
was
at
naeme
that
i
saw
for
the
first
time
a
swarm
of
locusts
they
so
completely
covered
the
surface
of
the
ground
that
my
horse
killed
numbers
of
them
at
every
step
whilst
i
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
keeping
from
my
face
those
which
rose
up
and
flew
about
this
species
is
called
in
syria
djerad
nedjdyat
arabic
or
djerad
teyar
arabic
the
flying
locusts
being
thus
distinguished
from
the
other
species
called
djerad
dsahhaf
arabic
or
devouring
locusts
the
former
have
a
yellow
body
a
gray
breast
and
wings
of
a
dirty
white
with
gray
spots
the
latter
i
was
told
have
a
whitish
gray
body
and
white
wings
the
nedjdyat
are
much
less
dreaded
than
the
others
because
they
feed
only
upon
the
leaves
of
trees
and
vegetables
sparing
the
wheat
and
barley
the
dsahhaf
on
the
contrary
devour
whatever
vegetation
they
meet
with
and
are
the
terror
of
the
husbandmen
the
nedjdyat
attack
only
the
produce
of
the
gardener
or
the
wild
herbs
of
the
desert
i
was
told
however
that
the
offspring
of
the
nedjdyat
produced
in
syria
partake
of
the
voracity
of
the
dsahhaf
and
like
them
prey
upon
the
crops
of
grain
shemskein
those
which
i
saw
in
the
haouran
and
afterwards
in
the
gardens
of
damascus
fly
in
separate
bodies
and
do
not
spread
over
a
whole
district
the
young
of
this
species
are
quite
black
until
a
certain
age
the
bedouins
eat
locusts
which
are
collected
in
great
quantities
in
the
beginning
of
april
when
the
sexes
cohabit
and
they
are
easily
caught
after
having
been
roasted
a
little
upon
the
iron
plate
arabic
on
which
bread
is
baked
they
are
dried
in
the
sun
and
then
put
into
large
sacks
with
the
mixture
of
a
little
salt
they
are
never
served
up
as
a
dish
but
every
one
takes
a
handful
of
them
when
hungry
the
peasants
of
syria
do
not
eat
locusts
nor
have
i
myself
ever
had
an
opportunity
of
tasting
them
there
are
a
few
poor
fellahs
in
the
haouran
however
who
sometimes
pressed
by
hunger
make
a
meal
of
them
but
they
break
off
the
head
and
take
out
the
entrails
before
they
dry
them
in
the
sun
the
bedouins
swallow
them
entire
the
natural
enemy
of
the
locust
is
the
bird
semermar
arabic
which
is
of
the
size
of
a
swallow
and
devours
vast
numbers
of
them
it
is
even
said
that
the
locusts
take
flight
at
the
cry
of
the
bird
but
if
the
whole
feathered
tribe
of
the
districts
visited
by
locusts
were
to
unite
their
efforts
it
would
avail
little
so
immense
are
the
numbers
of
these
dreadful
insects
at
eight
hours
and
three
quarters
from

at

very
brisk

be
computed
at
nearly
twelve

about
five

its
particular
warehouse
these
stores
are
exclusively
for
the
pasha
suite
and
for
the
army
which
accompanies
the
hadj
and
are
chiefly
consumed
on
their
return
it
is
only
in
cases
of
great
abundance
and
by
particular
favour
that
the
pasha
permits
any
articles
to
be
sold
to
the
pilgrims
at
every
station
as
far
as
medina
is
a
castle
but
generally
smaller
than
this
filled
with
similar
stores
the
haouran
alone
is
required
to
deliver
every
year
into
the
store
houses
of
the
mezareib
two
thousand
gharara
of
barley
or
about
twenty
or
thousand
cwt
english
the
town
of
damascus
has
been
fed
for
the
last
three
months
with
the
biscuit
stored
in
the
mezareib
for
the
hadj
as
far
as
the
pasha
was
concerned
the
affairs
of
the
great
caravan
were
generally
well
managed
but
there
still
reigned
a
great
want
of
economy
and
the
expenses
of
the
hadjis
increased
every
year
of
late
years
the
hire
of
a
single
camel
from
damascus
to
mekka
has
been
seven
hundred
and
fifty
piastres
as
much
and
often
more
was
to
be
paid
on
coming
back
and
the
expenses
on
the
road
and
at
mekka
amounted
at
least
to
one
thousand
piastres
so
that
in
the
most
humble
way
the
journey
could
not
be
performed
at
less
than
two
thousand
five
hundred
piastres
or
sterling
a
camel
with
a
litter
cost
fifteen
hundred
in
going
and
as
much
in
coming
back
of
the
whole
caravan
not
above
part
were
real
pilgrims
the
rest
consisted
of
soldiers
the
servants
of
soldiers
people
attached
to
the
pasha
suite
merchants
pedlars
coffee
and
pipe
waiters
a
swarm
of
bedouins
together
with
several
tents
of
public
women
from
damascus
who
were
so
far
encouraged
that
whenever
they
were
unable
to
obtain
from
their
lovers
the
daily
food
for
their
horses
or
mules
they
obtained
a
supply
from
the
pasha
stores
the
greater
part
of
the
pilgrims
usually
contract
for
the
journey
with
one
of
the
great
undertakers
or
mekouam
arabic
as
they
are
called
this
agreement
is
only
for
a
beast
of
transport
and
for
water
as
to
eating
the
pilgrims
generally
mess
together
at
their
own
expense
in
bodies
of
about
half
a
dozen
the
mekouam
on
agreeing
to
furnish
a
beast
of
burthen
are
bound
to
replace
whatever
may
die
on
the
road
and
are
therefore
obliged
to
carry
with
them
at
least
one
unloaded
camel
for
every
loaded
one
it
is
a
general
practice
with
the
mekouam
to
obtain
as
large
sums
as
possible
on
account
from
the
pilgrims
who
engage
with
them
for
the
journey
they
generally
agree
among
each
other
upon
the
sum
to
be
demanded
as
well
as
the
moment
at
which
it
is
to
be
called
for
so
that
if
the
pilgrims
resist
the
imposition
the
hadj
sometimes
remains
encamped
on
the
same
spot
for
several
days
the
mekouam
all
refusing
to
proceed
and
feeing
the
pasha
for
his
connivance
at
their
injustice
on
their
return
to
damascus
if
they
have
already
extorted
from
the
pilgrims
in
the
course
of
the
journey
more
than
the
amount
of
their
contract
as
often
happens
they
generally
declare
themselves
to
be
bankrupts
and
then
the
value
of
a
few
camels
is
all
that
remains
to
pay
their
debts
to
the
pilgrims
those
pilgrims
who
do
not
engage
with
the
mekouam
as
is
generally
the
case
with
those
who
come
from
armenia
and
the
borders
of
the
black
sea
perform
the
journey
somewhat
cheaper
upon
their
own
beasts
but
they
are
on
the
road
by
the
mekouam
are
obliged
to
march
the
last
in
the
caravan
to
encamp
on
the
worst
ground
to
fill
their
water
skins
the
last
and
are
often
even
avanized
by
the
pasha
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
the
wretched
condition
of
the
greater
part
of
the
hadjis
and
the
bad
conduct
of
the
troops
and
arabs
thieving
and
robbery
have
become
general
among
them
and
it
is
more
the
want
of
sleep
from
fear
of
being
plundered
which
causes
the
death
of
so
many
pilgrims
than
the
fatigues
of
the
journey
the
pasha
troops
particularly
those
called
howara
which
bring
up
the
rear
of
the
caravan
are
frequently
known
to
kill
the
stragglers
during
the
night
in
order
to
strip
them
of
their
property
the
pasha
it
is
true
often
punishes
such
delinquents
and
scarcely
a
day
passes
without
some
one
being
empaled
alive
the
caravan
moves
on
and
the
malefactor
is
left
to
be
devoured
by
the
birds
of
prey
the
bedouins
are
particularly
dexterous
in
pilfering
at
night
they
sometimes
assume
the
dress
of
the
pasha
infantry
and
thus
introduce
themselves
unnoticed
amongst
the
camels
of
the
rich
hadjis
when
they
throw
the
sleeping
owner
from
his
mule
or
camel
and
in
the
confusion
occasioned
by
the
cries
of
the
fallen
rider
drive
off
the
beast
the
caravan
marches
daily
from
asser
or
about
three
hours
after
day
during
the
whole
of
the
night
and
till
the
followingmorning
when
the
tents
are
pitched
it
never
stops
but
during
prayers
the
arabs
of
sokhne
tedmor
and
haouran
together
with
the
bedouins
who
let
out
their
camels
precede
or
follow
the
caravan
at
the
distance
of
one
march
they
transport
the
provisions
for
the
pasha
troops
of
which
they
steal
and
publicly
sell
at
least
they
march
during
the
day
and
encamp
in
the
evening
their
caravan
is
called
el
selma
arabic
it
passes
the
great
caravan
once
every
two
or
three
days
and
then
encamps
till
the
latter
comes
up
when
they
supply
the
suite
with
provisions
the
cheapest
mode
of
performing
the
pilgrimage
is
to
agree
for
a
camel
with
one
of
those
arabs
but
the
fatigue
is
much
greater
in
following
the
selma
the
last
year
in
which
the
hadj
quitted
damascus
the
pilgrims
reached
the
gates
of
medina
but
they
were
not
permitted
to
enter
the
town
nor
to
proceed
to
mekka
and
after
an
unsuccessful
negotiation
of
seven
days
they
were
obliged
to
return
to
damascus
about
two
hundred
persian
hadjis
only
who
were
with
the
caravan
were
allowed
to
pass
on
paying
a
large
sum
of
money
ibn
saoud
the
wahabi
chief
had
one
interview
with
abdullah
pasha
accompanied
by
the
whole
of
his
retinue
at
djebel

near

they
exchanged
presents

the

in

we
left
mezareib
towards
the
evening
and
were
obliged
to
proceed
el
torra
alone
along
the
hadj
route
the
fear
of
the
aeneze
rendering
every
one
unwilling
to
accompany
us
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
came
to
a
bridge
over
the

arabic
to
the
left
near
the
road
is
the
ruined
village
kherbet
el
ghazale
arabic
where
the
hadj
sometimes
encamps
it
often
happens
that
the
caravan
does
not
encamp
upon
the
usual
spots
owing
to
a
wish
either
to
accelerate
or
to
prolong
the
journey
past
the
akabe
near
the
head
of
the
red
sea
beyond
which
the
bones
of
dead
camels
are
the
only
guides
of
the
pilgrim
through
the
waste
of
sand
the
caravan
often
loses
its
way
and
overshoots
the
day
station
in
such
cases
the
are
sometimes
exhausted
and
many
pilgrims
perish
through
fatigue
and
thirst
at
one
hour
from
the
mezareib
following
the
river
that
issues
from
the
small
lake
are
several
mills
from
thence
begins
the

arabic
coming
from
the
eastward
with
a
bridge
over
it
built
by
djezzar
pasha
in
winter
this
generally
proves
a
very
difficult
passage
to
the
hadj
on
account
of
the
swampy
ground
and
the
peasants
of
the
adjacent
villages
are
in
consequence
obliged
to
cover
the
road
with
a
thick
layer
of
straw
at
one

through
the
centre
of
which
lies
the
road
here
as
in
so
many
other
parts
of
the
haouran
i
saw
the
most
luxuriant
wild
herbage
through
which
my
horse
with
difficulty
made
his
way
artificial
meadows
can
hardly
be
finer
than
these
desert
fields
and
it
is
this
which
renders
the
haouran
so
favourite
an
abode
of
the
bedouins
the
peasants
of
syria
are
ignorant
of
the
advantages
of
feeding
their
cattle
with
hay
they
suffer
the
superfluous
grass
to
wither
away
and
in
summer
and
winter
feed
them
on
cut
straw
in
one
remtha
hour
and
a
quarter
we
passed
wady

our
road
lying
one
hour
and
three
quarters
we
came
to

torrent
descending
from

flowing
in
a
deep
bed
along
which
the
road
continues
for
some
time
in
two
hours
and
three
quarters
quick
walking
we
came
to
remtha

a
station
of
the
hadj
which
encamps
near
two
birkets
or
reservoirs
formed
in
the
bed
of
the
wady
by
means
of
three
high
walls
built
across
it
a
large
tribe
of
aeneze
were
watering
their
cattle

we
passed

contains
about
one
hundred
families

neighbourhood
are
a
number
of
wells
of

we
met
with
a
very
indifferent
reception
at
the
house
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
villages
on
the
hadj
route
exceed
all
others
in
fanatism
an
old
man
was
particularly
severe
in
his
animadversions
on
kafers
treading
the
sacred
earth
which
leads
to
the
kaabe
and
the
youngsters
echoed
his
insulting
language
i
found
means
however
to
show
the
old
man
a
penknife
which
i
carried
in
my
pocket
and
made
him
a
present
of
it
before
he
could
ask
it
of
me
we
then
became
as
great
friends
as
we
had
been
enemies
and
his
behaviour
induced
a
like
change
in
the
others
towards
me
a
penknife
worth
two
shillings
overcomes
the
fanatism
of
a
peasant
increase
the
present
and
it
will
have
equal
effect
upon
a
townsman
make
it
a
considerable
sum

the
mufti
himself
will
wave
all
religious
scruples

eight

dry

a

brought
us
to

it
is
not
very
good
but
serves
very
well
the
purposes
of
this
people
i
passed
a
most
unpleasant
night
here
it
is
the
custom
for
the
sake
of
saving
to
light
every
evening
a
large
fire
for
the
supply
of
which
there
is
plenty
of
dry
wood
in
the
neighbouring
mountain
the
room
where
i
lodged
was
thus
soon
filled
with
smoke
which
had
no
other
issue
than
a
small
door
and
even
this
was
shut
to
keep
out
the
cattle
the
peasants
seemed
to
delight
in
the
heat
thus
occasioned
they
took
off
all
their
clothes
except
the
abba
and
sat
smoaking
and
laughing
till
midnight
i
wished
to
imitate
them
but
did
not
dare
to
strip
for
fear
of
shewing
the
leathern
girdle
containing
my
money
which
i
wore
under
my
clothes
towards
the
morning
the
fire
went
out
and
the
company
was
asleep
i
then
opened
the
door
to
let
the
smoke
out
and
slept
a
few
hours
under
the
influence
of
the
morning
breeze
there
is
an
ancient
ruined
square
building
at
souf
with
several
broken
columns
from
one
of
them
i
copied
the
following
inscription
written
in
very
small
characters
greek
upon
a
pillar
near
it
is
a
fine
inscription
but
now
quite
illegible
at
the
spring
of
ayn
keykebe
which
is
covered
by
a
small
arched
building
i
copied
some
characters
from
a
broken
stone
lying
in
the
water
the
following
were
the
ending
of
the
inscription
greek
near
the
sources
are
numerous
caverns
in
which
the
poor
families
of
souf
reside
may
being
impatient
to
reach
djerash
i
left
souf
early
in
the
morning
taking
with
me
a
guide
who
was
afterwards
to
have
conducted
me
towards
szalt
in
the
djebel
belka
our
road
lay
along
the
mountain
on
the
west
side
of
wady

on
the
side
of
the
wady
half
an
hour
from
souf
is
the
ruined
place
called
kherbet

arabic
three
quarters
of
an
hour
from
souf
in
our
road
and
just
over
the
ruined
city
of
djerash
are
the
ruins
called
kherbet
el
deir
with
a
turkish
chapel
named
mezar
abou
beker
our
road
lay
in
one
hour
we
passed
n
the
declivity
of
the
mountain
descending
towards
djerash
a
place
which
i
supposed
to
have
been
the
burying
place
of
djerash
djerash
i
counted
upwards
of
fifty
sarcophagi
and
there
were
many
more
they
are
formed
of
the
calcareous
stone
with
which
the
zoueit
and
moerad
mountains
are
composed
some
of
them
are
sunk
to
a
level
with
the
surface
of
the
ground
which
is
very
rocky
others
appear
to
have
been
removed
from
their
original
position
the
largest
was
ten
spans
in
length
and
three
and
a
half
in
breadth
but
the
greater
part
are
much
smaller
and
are
not
even
large
enough
to
contain
the
corpse
of
a
full
grown
person
on
the
sides
of
a
few
of
them
are
sculptured
ornaments
in
as
festoons
genii
but
in
a
mutilated
state
and
not
remarkable
for
beauty
of
execution
i
saw
only
one
that
was
elegantly
wrought
the
whole
of
these
sarcophagi
had
flat
covers
a
few
of
which
still
remain
upon
one
of
the
largest
of
the
sarcophagi
and
which
is
one
of
those
first
met
with
in
going
from
souf
is
a
long
inscription
but
so
mutilated
as
to
be
almost
wholly
illegible
in
the
neighbourhood
are
several
heaps
of
large
square
stones
the
remains
of
some
building
in
an
hour
and
a
half
from
souf
we
reached
the
city
walls
of
djerash
or
kerash
arabic
the
dj
being
the
bedouin
pronunciation
of
the
letter
arabic
which
in
the
language
of
the
city
corresponds
with
our
djerash
was
built
upon
an
elevated
plain
in
the
mountains
of
moerad
on
uneven
ground
on
both
sides
of
wady
deir
which
besides
the
name
of
kerouan
arabic
bears
also
that
of
seil
djerash
arabic
or
the
river
of
djerash
this
river
empties
itself
at
a
short
distance
from
the
town
into
the
wady
zerka
arabic
probably
the
jabock
of
the
ancients
the
principal
part
of
the
city
stands
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
where
the
surface
is
more
level
than
on
the
opposite
side
although
the
right
bank
is
steeper
than
the
other
the
present
ruins
prove
the
magnitude
and
importance
of
the
ancient
city
and
the
modern
name
leads
to
the
belief
that
it
was
the
ancient
gerasa
one
of
the
principal
djerash
towns
of
the
decapolis
although
this
position
does
not
at
all
agree
with
that
given
to
gerasa
from
the
ancient
authorities
by
who
places
it
to
the
of
the
lake
of
tiberias
forty
miles
to
the
of
this
place
the
ruins
are
nearly
an
hour
and
a
quarter
in
circumference
following
insulated
fragments
of
the
walls
which
were
upwards
of
eight
feet
in
thickness
and
built
of
square
hewn
stones
of
middling
size
i
could
not
judge
of
their
original
heighth
as
the
upper
parts
were
every
where
demolished
i
shall
now
enumerate
the
principal
curiosities
of
djerash
agreeably
to
the
annexed
plan
which
may
give
a
general
idea
of
the
whole
for
its
accuracy
in
regard
to
distances
i
do
not
mean
to
vouch
as
i
had
at
most
only
four
hours
to
make
my
survey
and
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
i
could
persuade
my
three
companions
to
wait
so
long
for
me
none
of
them
would
accompany
me
through
the
ruins
on
account
of
their
fear
of
the
bedouins
who
are
in
the
habit
of
visiting
this
wady
they
therefore
concealed
themselves
beneath
the
trees
that
overshade
the
river
the
first
object
that
strikes
the
attention
in
coming
from
souf
after
passing
the
is
a
temple
a
its
main
body
consists
of
an
oblong
square
the
interior
of
which
is
about
paces
in
length
and
eighteen
in
breadth
a
double
row
of
six
columns
in
each
row
adorned
the
front
of
the
temple
of
the
first
row
five
columns
are
yet
standing
of
the
second
four
and
on
each
side
of
the
temple
there
remains
one
column
belonging
to
the
single
row
of
pillars
that
surrounded
the
temple
on
every
side
except
the
front
of
these
eleven
columns
nine
are
entire
and
two
are
without
capitals
their
style
of
architecture
is
much
superior
to
that
of
the
great
colonnade
hereafter
to
be
mentioned
and
seems
to
belong
to
the
best
period
of
the
corinthian
order
their
capitals
being
beautifully
ornamented
with
the
acanthus
leaves
the
shafts
are
composed
of
five
or
six
pieces
and
are
seven
spans
and
a
half
in
diameter
and
to
forty
feet
in
heighth
i
was
unable
to
ascertain
the
number
of
columns
in
the
flanks
of
the
peristyle
the
temple
stands
upon
an
artificial
terrace
elevated
five
or
six
feet
above
the
ground
the
interior
of
the
temple
is
choaked
with
the
ruins
of
the
roof
a
part
of
the
front
wall
of
the
cella
has
fallen
down
but
the
three
other
sides
are
entire
the
walls
are
wthout
ornament
on
the
interior
of
each
of
the
two
side
walls
and
about
from
the
floor
are
six
niches
of
an
oblong
shape
and
quite
plain
in
the
back
wall
opposite
to
the
door
is
a
vaulted
recess
with
a
small
dark
chamber
on
each
side
the
upper
part
of
a
niche
is
visible
on
the
exterior
of
the
remains
of
the
front
wall
with
some
trifling
but
elegantly
sculptured
ornaments
this
ruin
stands
within
a
peribolus
or
large
area
surrounded
by
a
double
row
of
columns
the
whole
edifice
seems
to
have
been
superior
in
taste
and
magnificence
to
every
public
building
of
this
kind
in
syria
the
temple
of
the
sun
at
palmyra
excepted
on
the
two
sides
marked
x
of
the
colonnade
of
the
peribolus
many
bases
and
broken
shafts
of
the
inner
row
of
columns
are
yet
standing
on
the
two
other
sides
there
are
but
few
these
columns
are
three
spans
and
a
half
in
diameter
on
the
long
side
x
forty
columns
may
be
traced
to
have
stood
at
only
three
paces
distant
from
each
other
on
the
opposite
long
side
one
perfect
column
is
yet
standing
on
the
short
side
x
are
three
in
the
outer
row
without
their
capitals
the
corner
columns
of
this
peribolus
were
double
and
in
the
shape
of
a
heart
as
in
the
annexed
figure
of
the
outer
row
of
the
peribolus
very
little
remains
indeed
it
may
be
doubted
whether
any
outer
row
ever
existed
opposite
to
the
back
of
the
temple
where
the
ground
is
rocky
and
uneven
the
number
of
columns
which
originally
adorned
the
temple
and
its
area
was
not
less
than
two
hundred
or
two
hundred
and
fifty
proceeding
westwards
from
the
above
described
ruin
through
the
remains
of
private
habitations
at
about
two
hundred
yards
distant
from
it
are
the
remains
of
a
small
temple
b
with
three
corinthian
pillars
still
standing
a
street
still
paved
in
some
places
leads
from
thence
to
a
spot
where
several
small
broken
columns
are
lying
turning
from
thence
to
the
i
entered
a
street
c
adorned
with
a
colonnade
on
either
side
about
thirty
broken
shafts
are
yet
standing
and
two
entire
columns
but
without
their
capitals
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
opposite
to
them
are
five
columns
with
their
capitals
and
entablatures
these
columns
are
rather
small
without
pedestals
of
different
sizes
the
highest
being
about
fifteen
feet
and
in
a
bad
taste
originally
there
must
have
been
about
fifty
pillars
in
this
street
a
little
farther
on
to
the
this
street
crosses
the
principal
street
of
the
town
and
where
the
two
streets
meet
are
four
large
cubical
masses
of
stone
d
each
occupying
one
of
the
angles
of
the
intersection
similar
to
those
which
i
saw
at
shohba
and
intended
perhaps
to
imitate
the
beautiful
pedestals
in
the
middle
of
the
great
portico
at
palmyra
these
cubes
are
about
seven
feet
high
and
about
eighteen
spans
broad
on
each
side
of
them
is
a
small
niche
three
are
entire
and
the
fourth
is
in
ruins
they
may
have
served
as
pedestals
for
statues
or
like
those
at
palmyra
may
have
supported
a
small
dome
upon
columns
under
which
stood
a
statue
i
endeavoured
to
examine
the
tops
of
the
cubes
but
they
are
all
thickly
overgrown
with
shrubs
which
it
was
not
in
my
power
to
clear
away
there
were
no
traces
whatever
of
statues
having
stood
upon
those
which
i
saw
at
shohba
following
the
great
street
marked
e
i
came
again
to
the
remains
of
columns
on
both
sides
these
were
much
larger
than
the
former
and
the
street
of
which
some
parts
of
the
pavement
yet
remain
was
much
broader
than
that
marked
c
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
street
stand
seventeen
corinthian
columns
sixteen
of
which
are
united
by
their
entablature
they
vary
in
size
and
do
not
correspond
in
height
either
with
those
opposite
to
them
or
with
those
in
the
same
line
a
circumstance
which
added
to
the
style
of
the
capitals
seems
to
prove
that
the
long
street
is
a
built
at
different
periods
and
of
less
ancient
construction
than
the
temple
some
of
the
columns
are
as
high
as
thirty
feet
others
the
shortest
i
estimated
at
twenty
feet
their
entablatures
are
slightly
ornamented
with
sculptured
where
a
high
column
stands
near
a
shorter
one
the
architrave
over
the
latter
reposes
upon
a
projecting
bracket
worked
into
the
shaft
of
the
higher
one
next
comes
following
the
street
in
the
same
direction
on
the
right
one
insulated
column
and
three
large
columns
with
their
entablature
joined
to
four
shorter
ones
in
the
way
just
described
then
two
columns
and
five
and
two
all
with
their
entablatures
making
in
the
whole
on
the
right
side
of
the
street
counting
from
the
cubes
columns
yet
standing
on
the
left
opposite
the
three
large
ones
joined
to
the
four
smaller
are
five
columns
of
middling
size
with
their
entablatures
and
a
single
large
one
but
the
greater
number
of
the
columns
on
this
side
have
fallen
and
are
lying
on
the
ground
in
some
places
behind
the
colonnade
on
the
right
are
low
apartments
some
of
which
are
vaulted
and
appear
to
have
been
shops
they
are
similar
to
those
which
i
saw
in
the
long
street
at
soueida
in
the
mountain
of
the
druses
see
page
the
long
street
just
described
terminates
in
a
large
open
space
f
enclosed
by
a
magnificent
semicircle
of
columns
in
a
single
row
seven
columns
are
yet
standing
originally
there
may
have
been
about
eighty
to
the
right
on
entering
the
forum
are
four
and
then
one
united
by
their
entablatures
to
the
left
five
seven
and
twenty
also
with
entablatures
the
latter
twenty
are
taller
than
the
others
the
lower
ground
on
which
they
stand
having
required
an
increased
height
of
column
in
order
to
place
the
whole
entablature
of
the
semicircle
on
the
same
level
the
pillars
near
the
entrance
are
about
fifteen
feet
in
height
and
one
foot
and
a
half
in
diameter
they
are
all
of
the
ionic
order
and
thus
they
differ
from
all
the
other
columns
remaining
in
the
city
the
radius
of
the
semicircle
in
following
the
direction
of
the
long
street
was
one
hundred
and
five
paces
at
the
end
of
the
semicircle
opposite
to
the
long
street
are
several
basins
which
seem
to
have
been
reservoirs
of
water
and
remains
of
an
aqueduct
are
still
visible
which
probably
supplied
them
to
the
right
and
left
are
some
low
arched
chambers
from
this
spot
the
ground
rises
and
on
mounting
a
low
but
steep
hill
before
me
i
found
on
its
top
the
remains
of
a
beautiful
temple
g
commanding
a
view
over
the
greater
part
of
the
town
the
front
of
the
temple
does
not
stand
directly
opposite
to
the
long
street
and
the
forum
but
declines
somewhat
to
the
northward
like
the
temple
first
described
it
was
adorned
with
a
corinthian
peristyle
of
which
one
column
only
remains
at
the
south
angle
in
front
was
a
double
row
of
columns
with
eight
as
i
conjecture
in
each
row
they
seem
to
have
been
thrown
down
by
an
earthquake
and
many
of
them
are
now
lying
on
the
declivity
of
the
hill
in
the
same
order
in
which
they
originally
stood
they
are
six
spans
and
a
half
in
diameter
and
their
capitals
appeared
to
me
of
a
still
finer
execution
than
those
of
the
great
temple
i
am
unable
to
judge
of
the
number
of
columns
on
the
long
sides
of
the
peristyle
their
broken
shafts
lie
about
in
immense
heaps
on
every
side
of
the
temple
except
the
front
there
appears
to
have
been
a
large
ditch
round
the
temple
of
the
cella
the
walls
only
remain
the
roof
entrance
and
back
wall
having
fallen
down
the
interior
of
the
cella
is
thirty
paces
in
length
and
in
breadth
the
walls
within
are
in
a
better
state
than
those
of
the
temple
a
which
are
much
impaired
on
the
outside
of
each
of
the
two
long
walls
was
a
row
of
six
niches
similar
to
those
within
the
temple
a
on
entering
the
temple
by
the
front
door
i
found
on
the
right
a
side
door
leading
towards
a
large
theatre
h
on
the
side
of
the
hill
and
at
about
sixty
paces
distant
from
the
temple
it
fronts
the
town
so
that
the
spectators
seated
upon
the
highest
row
of
benches
enjoyed
the
prospect
of
all
its
principal
buildings
and
quarters
there
are
eight
rows
of
seats
upwards
of
two
feet
in
breadth
between
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
rows
reckoning
from
the
top
a
tier
of
eight
boxes
or
small
apartments
intervenes
each
separated
from
the
other
by
a
thick
wall
the
uppermost
row
of
benches
is
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
paces
in
circuit
in
three
different
places
are
small
narrow
staircases
opening
into
the
rows
to
facilitate
the
ingress
or
egress
of
the
spectators
in
front
the
theatre
is
closed
by
a
proscenium
or
wall
about
forty
paces
in
length
embellished
within
by
five
richly
decorated
niches
connected
with
each
other
by
a
line
of
middling
sized
columns
of
which
two
remain
with
their
entablatures
and
six
without
their
capitals
within
these
was
another
parallel
range
of
columns
of
which
five
are
yet
standing
with
their
entablatures
the
entrance
to
the
theatre
was
by
steps
between
the
two
ends
of
the
proscenium
and
the
two
extremities
of
the
semicircle
near
the
proscenium
the
steps
on
both
sides
are
ruined
but
in
the
other
parts
they
are
perfect
the
town
wall
runs
very
near
the
back
of
the
theatre
on
this
side
of
the
town
there
are
no
other
ruins
of
any
consequence
excepting
the
gate
which
is
about
five
minutes
walk
from
the
semicircle
of
columns
it
is
a
fine
arch
and
apparently
in
perfect
preservation
with
a
smaller
one
on
each
side
adorned
with
several
pilasters
i
did
not
examine
it
closely
meaning
to
return
to
it
in
taking
a
review
of
what
i
had
already
seen
but
my
guides
were
so
tired
with
waiting
that
they
positively
refused
to
expose
their
persons
longer
to
danger
and
walked
off
leaving
me
the
alternative
of
remaining
alone
in
this
desolate
spot
or
of
abandoning
the
hope
of
correcting
my
notes
by
a
second
examination
of
the
ruins
returning
from
the
theatre
through
the
long
street
towards
the
four
cubic
pedestals
i
continued
from
thence
in
a
straight
line
along
the
main
street
l
the
pavement
of
which
is
preserved
in
several
places
on
the
right
hand
were
first
seven
columns
having
their
entablatures
and
farther
on
to
the
left
seven
others
also
with
their
entablatures
then
on
the
right
three
large
columns
without
entablatures
but
with
pedestals
which
none
of
those
already
mentioned
have
opposite
to
the
latter
on
the
left
hand
side
of
the
street
are
two
insulated
columns
the
three
large
columns
are
equal
in
size
to
those
of
the
peristyle
of
the
temple
a
they
stand
in
the
same
line
with
the
colonnade
of
the
street
and
belonged
to
a
small
building
m
of
the
body
of
which
nothing
remains
except
the
circular
back
wall
containing
several
niches
almost
in
complete
ruins
on
a
broken
pedestal
lying
on
the
ground
between
two
of
the
columns
of
this
building
is
the
following
inscription
greek
there
is
another
stone
with
an
inscription
upon
it
but
i
could
make
nothing
of
it
the
street
is
here
choaked
up
with
fragments
of
columns
close
to
the
three
columns
stands
a
single
one
and
at
a
short
distance
further
to
the
left
is
a
large
gateway
n
leading
up
to
the
temple
a
which
is
situated
on
considerably
higher
ground
and
is
not
visible
from
the
street
on
either
side
of
the
gateway
are
niches
and
a
wall
built
of
middling
sized
square
stones
which
runs
for
some
distance
parallel
with
the
street
among
a
heap
of
stones
lying
under
the
gate
i
copied
the
following
inscriptions
from
a
broken
stone
greek
the
letters
of
the
word
opnha
are
five
inches
in
length
upon
another
broken
stone
near
it
was
this
greek
and
close
to
the
latter
upon
the
edge
of
a
large
stone
this
greek
continuing
along
the
main
street
i
came
at
q
to
a
single
column
and
then
to
two
with
entablatures
on
the
right
opposite
to
them
on
the
left
are
three
single
columns
beyond
the
latter
for
one
hundred
paces
all
the
columns
have
fallen
i
then
came
to
an
open
rotunda
r
with
four
entrances
around
the
inside
of
its
wall
are
projecting
pedestals
for
statues
the
entraces
on
the
right
and
left
conduct
into
a
street
running
at
right
angles
to
the
main
street
i
followed
this
cross
street
to
my
left
and
found
on
the
right
hand
side
of
it
three
short
ionic
pillars
with
their
entablatures
close
to
the
rotunda
proceeding
in
the
same
direction
i
soon
reached
a
quadrangle
s
of
fine
large
corinthian
columns
the
handsomest
in
the
town
next
to
those
of
the
temple
to
the
right
stand
four
with
their
entablatures
and
one
single
formerly
they
were
six
in
number
the
fifth
is
the
deficient
one
the
first
and
sixth
are
like
those
in
the
area
of
the
temple
a
they
are
composed
of
more
than
a
dozen
frusta
and
what
is
remarkable
in
a
place
where
stone
is
so
abundant
each
frustum
consists
of
two
pieces
opposite
to
the
two
first
columns
of
the
row
just
described
are
two
columns
with
their
entablatures
this
colonnade
stands
in
front
of
a
theatre
t
to
which
it
evidently
formed
an
appendage
this
theatre
is
not
calculated
to
hold
so
many
spectators
as
the
one
already
described
though
its
area
is
considerably
larger
being
from
to
fifty
paces
in
diameter
it
has
sixteen
rows
of
benches
with
a
tier
of
six
boxes
intervening
between
the
tenth
and
eleventh
rows
reckoning
from
the
top
between
every
two
boxes
is
a
niche
forming
a
very
elegant
ornament
this
theatre
was
evidently
destined
for
purposes
different
from
the
other
probably
for
combats
of
wild
beasts
the
area
below
the
benches
is
more
extensive
and
there
is
a
suite
of
dark
arched
chambers
under
the
lowest
row
of
seats
opening
into
the
area
near
the
chief
entrance
of
the
theatre
which
is
from
the
in
the
direction
by
which
i
entered
the
colonnade
in
front
of
the
theatre
there
seems
formerly
to
have
been
a
wall
across
the
diameter
of
the
and
between
this
wall
and
the
colonnade
there
is
on
both
sides
a
short
wall
with
a
large
niche
or
apartment
in
it
the
colonnade
stands
upon
lower
ground
than
the
theatre
having
returned
from
hence
to
the
rotunda
in
the
long
street
i
followed
it
along
the
colonnade
v
and
found
the
greater
number
of
the
columns
to
have
ionic
capitals
on
the
right
side
are
only
two
small
columns
with
their
entablatures
to
the
left
are
eight
two
three
two
four
and
again
three
each
set
with
their
entablatures
close
to
the
ruined
w
near
the
bank
of
the
river
is
a
single
column
i
shall
now
describe
the
ancient
buildings
which
i
observed
on
the
side
of
the
long
street
the
street
which
leads
from
the
theatre
across
the
rotunda
r
is
prolonged
from
thence
towards
the
side
of
the
river
it
was
lined
with
columns
of
which
two
only
with
their
entablatures
remain
and
it
terminates
at
a
vast
edifice
u
situated
over
the
river
and
extending
along
its
banks
forty
or
fifty
paces
it
is
divided
into
many
apartments
the
greater
part
of
which
have
arched
roofs
some
of
them
are
very
lofty
i
now
returned
towards
the
gateway
n
and
found
opposite
to
it
and
to
the
great
temple
a
a
second
cross
street
running
towards
the
river
it
had
originally
a
colonnade
but
none
of
the
columns
are
now
standing
it
terminates
at
about
thirty
paces
from
the
main
street
in
a
gate
through
which
i
entered
into
a
long
quadrangle
of
columns
where
on
the
right
hand
four
and
then
three
columns
with
their
entablatures
are
still
standing
at
the
end
of
this
place
are
the
remains
of
a
circular
building
fronting
a
bridge
p
across
the
river
this
bridge
is
of
steep
ascent
owing
to
the
northern
banks
being
considerably
higher
than
the
southern
and
it
is
no
longer
passable
having
returned
to
the
four
cubical
pedestals
d
i
followed
to
the
left
the
continuation
of
the
street
c
by
which
i
had
first
approached
those
pedestals
and
which
having
crossed
the
main
street
at
the
pedestals
leads
to
the
river
where
it
terminated
at
a
broad
flight
of
steps
leading
down
to
the
bridge
k
of
the
colonnade
of
this
street
i
some
broken
shafts
only
are
standing
the
bridge
is
fourteen
feet
wide
with
a
high
centre
arch
and
two
lower
ones
it
is
built
with
great
solidity
and
its
pavement
is
exactly
of
the
same
construction
as
that
which
i
observed
in
the
streets
of
shohba
see
page
its
centre
is
broken
down
an
aqueduct
is
traced
from
the
side
of
the
building
u
passing
near
the
two
bridges
towards
the
southern
gate
of
the
town
such
weremy
observations
of
the
ruins
on
the
right
bank
of
the
wady
on
the
left
bank
little
else
remains
than
heaps
of
ruins
of
private
habitations
and
numerous
fragments
of
columns
i
must
confess
however
that
i
did
not
examine
the
part
of
the
town
towards
the
south
gate
but
i
have
reason
to
believe
from
the
view
which
i
had
of
it
while
on
the
temple
hill
that
nothing
of
consequence
either
as
to
buildings
or
columns
is
there
to
be
met
with
the
only
buildings
which
i
observed
to
the
left
of
the
river
are
near
to
it
upon
a
narrow
plain
which
stretches
along
its
banks
nearly
opposite
to
the
temple
m
are
the
remains
of
a
building
y
similar
in
construction
to
that
marked
u
on
the
right
bank
i
supposed
it
to
be
a
bath
a
stream
of
water
descends
from
a
spring
in
the
mountain
and
after
flowing
through
this
division
of
the
town
passes
this
building
and
empties
itself
into
the
river
the
arched
rooms
of
the
building
y
are
loftier
than
those
in
u
near
the
former
stand
four
columns
two
insulated
and
two
with
entablatures
also
two
broken
shafts
the
only
fluted
ones
that
i
saw
in
the
city
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
nearly
opposite
to
the
w
is
a
ruined
building
x
which
appears
to
have
been
a
small
temple
a
single
column
is
standing
amidst
a
heap
of
broken
ones
between
this
spot
and
the
building
y
are
the
remains
of
an
aqueduct
besides
the
one
hundred
and
ninety
columns
or
thereabouts
which
i
have
enumerated
in
the
above
description
there
are
upwards
of
one
hundred
half
columns
also
standing
i
did
not
see
any
marks
of
the
frusta
of
the
columns
having
been
joined
by
iron
hooks
as
at
palmyra
of
the
private
habitations
of
the
city
there
is
none
in
a
state
of
preservation
but
the
whole
of
the
area
within
the
walls
is
covered
with
their
ruins
the
stone
with
which
djerash
is
built
is
calcareous
of
considerable
hardness
and
the
same
as
the
rock
of
the
neighbouring
mountains
i
did
not
observe
any
other
stone
to
have
been
employed
and
it
is
matter
of
surprise
that
no
granite
columns
should
be
found
here
as
they
abound
in
syrian
cities
of
much
less
note
and
magnificence
than
djerash
it
had
been
my
intention
to
proceed
from
djerash
to
the
village
of
djezaze
in
my
way
to
the
castle
of
szalt
in
the
mountains
of
belka
from
whence
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
visit
amman
after
many
fruitless
enquiries
for
a
guide
a
man
of
souf
at
last
offered
to
conduct
me
to
szalt
and
he
had
accompanied
us
as
far
as
djerash
but
when
after
having
surveyed
the
ruins
i
rejoined
my
companions
he
had
changed
his
mind
and
insisted
on
returning
immediately
to
souf
this
was
occasioned
by
his
fear
of
the
arabs
beni
szakher
who
had
for
sometime
past
been
at
war
with
the
arabs
of
djebel
belka
and
the
government
of
damascus
and
who
were
now
extending
their
plundering
incursions
all
over
the
mountain
the
name
of
the
beni
szakher
is
generally
dreaded
in
these
parts
and
the
greater
or
less
facility
with
which
the
traveller
can
visit
them
depends
entirely
upon
the
good
or
bad
terms
existing
between
those
arabs
and
the
pasha
if
they
are
friends
one
of
the
tribe
may
easily
be
found
to
serve
as
a
guide
but
when
they
are
enemies
the
traveller
is
exposed
to
the
danger
of
being
stripped
and
if
the
animosity
of
the
two
parties
is
very
great
of
even
being
murdered
the
mutsellim
of
damascus
had
given
me
letters
to
the
chief
of
the
aatyl
arabs
el
belka
and
to
the
commander
of
the
pasha
cavalry
who
had
been
sent
to
assist
them
against
the
beni
szakher
the
allies
were
encamped
in
the
neighbourhood
of
kalaat
el
zerka
while
the
beni
szakher
had
collected
their
forces
at
amman
itself
a
place
still
famous
for
the
abundance
of
its
waters
under
these
circumstances
i
determined
to
proceed
first
to
szalt
hoping
that
i
might
from
thence
attain
amman
more
easily
as
the
inhabitants
of
szalt
who
are
always
more
or
less
rebellious
towards
the
government
of
damascus
are
generally
on
friendly
terms
with
the
bedouins
the
fears
of
my
guide
however
prevented
me
from
executing
this
plan
and
i
was
most
reluctantly
obliged
to
return
to
souf
for
it
would
have
been
madness
to
proceed
alone
we
returned
to
souf
not
by
the
road
over
the
mountain
but
in
following
the
course
of
the
rivulet
in
the
valley
el
deir
which
we
reascended
up
to
the
village
we
found
the
greater
part
of
the
narrow
plain
in
the
valley
sown
with
wheat
and
barley
by
the
people
of
souf
half
an
hour
from
the
town
in
the
wady
are
the
remains
of
a
large
reservoir
for
water
with
some
ruined
buildings
near
it
this
is
a
most
romantic
spot
large
oak
and
walnut
trees
overshade
the
stream
which
higher
up
flows
over
a
rocky
bed
nearer
the
village
are
some
olive
plantations
in
the
wady
we
reached
souf
in
two
hours
from
djerash
i
enquired
in
vain
for
a
guide
to
szalt
the
return
of
the
man
who
had
engaged
to
conduct
me
made
the
others
equally
cautious
and
nobody
would
accept
of
the
fifteen
piastres
which
i
offered
i
thought
in
unnecessary
therefore
to
stop
any
longer
at
souf
and
left
it
the
same
evening
in
order
to
visit
djebel
adjeloun
our
road
lay
up
a
mountain
through
a
thick
forest
of
oak
trees
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
from
souf
we
reached
the
summit
of
the
mountain
which
forms
the
frontier
between
the
district
of
moerad
and
the
djebel
adjeloun
this
is
the
thickest
forest
i
had
yet
seen
in
rabbad
syria
where
the
term
forest
arabic
or
arabic
is
often
applied
to
places
in
which
the
trees
grow
at
twenty
paces
from
each
other
in
an
hour
and
a
half
we
came
to
the
village
ain
djenne
arabic
in
a
fertile
valley
called
wady
djenne
at
the
extremity
of
which
several
springs
issue
from
under
the
rock
may
there
are
several
christian
families
at
ain
djenne
in
the
neighbouring
mountain
are
numerous
caverns
and
distant
half
an
hour
is
the
ruined
village
of
mar
elias
when
enquiring
for
ruins
which
might
answer
to
those
of
capitolias
i
had
been
referred
to
this
place
no
person
in
these
mountains
having
knowledge
of
any
other
ruins
an
olive
plantation
furnishes
the
principal
means
of
subsistence
to
the
eighty
families
who
inhabit
the
village
of
ain
djenne
we
set
out
early
in
the
morning
and
descended
the
valley
towards
adjeloun
arabic
which
has
given
its
name
to
the
district
it
is
built
in
a
narrow
passage
on
both
sides
of
the
rivulet
of
djenne
and
contains
nothing
remarkable
except
a
fine
ancient
mosque
i
left
my
horse
here
and
took
a
man
of
the
village
to
accompany
me
to
the
castle
of
rabbad
arabic
which
stands
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
three
quarters
of
an
hour
distant
from
adjeloun
to
the
left
of
the
road
at
a
short
distance
is
the
village
kefrandjy
from
ain
djenne
kalaat
el
rabbad
bears
by
it
is
the

the
house
of
barekat
in
whom
this
authority
has
for
many
years
resided
had
lately
been
quarrelling
about
it
among
themselves
the
chief
youssef
el
barekat
had
been
besieged
for
several
months
in
the
castle
he
was
now
gone
to
the
aga
of
tabaria
to
engage
him
in
his
interests
and
his
family
were
left
in
the
castle
with
strict
orders
not
to
let
any
unknown
persons
enter
it
and
to
keep
the
gate
secured
i
had
letters
of
recommendation
to
youssef
from
the
mutsellim
of
damascus
when
i
arrived
at
the
all
the
inhabitants
obeid
assembled
upon
the
wall
to
enquire
who
i
was
and
what
i
wanted
i
explained
to
them
the
nature
of
my
visit
and
shewed
them
the
mutsellim
letter
upon
which
they
opened
the
iron
gate
but
continued
to
entertain
great
suspicions
of
me
until
a
man
who
could
read
having
been
sent
for
my
letter
was
read
aloud
all
the
family
then
vied
in
civilities
towards
me
especially
when
i
told
them
that
i
intended
to
proceed
to
tabaria
kalaat
is
very
strong
and
as
appears
from
several
arabic
inscriptions
was
built
by
sultan
arabic
its
date
is
therefore
that
of
the
crusades
and
the
same
as
that
of
many
castles
in
other
parts
of
syria
which
owe
their
origin
to
the
vigilance
and
prudence
of
that
monarch
i
saw
nothing
particularly
worth
notice
in
it
its
thick
walls
arched
passages
and
small
bastions
are
common
to
all
the
castles
of
the
middle
ages
it
has
several
wells
but
on
the
outside
it
is
distinguished
by
the
deep
and
broad
ditch
which
surrounds
it
and
which
has
been
excavated
at
immense
labour
in
the
rock

as
well
as

it
commands
a
fine
prospect
it
is
now
inhabited
by
about
forty
persons
of
the
great
family
of

i
returned
from
kalaat
rabbad
to
adjeloun
where
i
rejoined
my
companions
and
after
set
out
for

our
road
lay
up
the
mountain
in
the
narrow
wady

at
half
an
hour
from

we
passed
the
spring
called

arabic
at
two
hours
the
district
of
djebel
adjeloun
terminates
and
that
of
obeid
begins
the
country
is
for
the
greater
part
woody
and
here
the
inhabitants
collect
considerable
quantities
of
galls
our

whence
the

distant
five
hours
and
a
quarter
from

el
hossn
is
the
principal
village
of
the
district
called
beni
obeid
it
stands
on
the
declivity
of
the
mountain
and
is
inhabited
by
upwards
of
one
hundred
families
of
which
about
are
greek
christians
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
patriarch
of
jerusalem
i
saw
nothing
remarkable
here
but
a
number
of
wells
cut
out
of
the
rock
i
happened
to
alight
at
the
same
house
where
seetzen
had
been
detained
for
eleven
days
by
bad
weather
his
hospitable
old
landlord
abdullah
el
ghanem
made
many
enquiries
after
him
may
i
found
very
bad
company
at
el
hossn
it
is
usual
for
the
pasha
of
damascus
to
send
annually
one
of
the
principal
officers
of
his
government
to
visit
the
southern
provinces
of
the
pashalik
to
exact
the
arrears
of
the
miri
and
to
levy
new
extortions
the
aga
of
tabaria
who
was
invested
this
year
with
the
office
had
just
arrived
in
the
village
with
a
suite
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
horsemen
whom
he
had
quartered
upon
the
peasants
my
landlord
had
seven
men
and
fifteen
horses
for
his
share
and
although
he
killed
a
sheep
and
boiled
about
twenty
pounds
of
rice
for
supper
yet
the
two
officers
of
the
party
in
his
house
were
continually
asking
for
more
spoiled
all
his
furniture
and
in
fact
acted
worse
than
an
enemy
would
have
done
it
is
to
avoid
vexations
of
this
kind
that
the
peasants
abandon
the
villages
most
exposed
to
such
visits
we
left
hossn
late
in
the
morning
and
proceeded
to
erbad
arabic
one
hour
and
a
quarter
from
the
former
our
road
lay
over

plain
erbad

the
chief
place
in
the

likewise
called
the
district
of
beni
djohma
arabic
or
of
bottein
arabic
from
the
sheikh
being
of
the
family
of
bottein
the
names
of
beni
obeid
and
beni
djohma
are
probably
derived
hebras
from
arab
tribes
which
anciently
settled
here
but
nobody
could
tell
me
the
origin
of
these
appellations
the
inhabitants
do
not
pretend
to
be
descendants
of
those
tribes
but
say
that
these
were
their
dwelling
places
from
time
immemorial
the
castle
of

upon
a
low

all

are
built
as
well
as
the
miserable
modern
walls
of

a
large
ancient
well
built
reservoir
is
the
only
curiosity
of
this
place
around

lay
several
handsome
sarcophagi
of
the

kind
of

some
sculptured
reliefs

are
upon

hill
at
about
one
hour
and
a
half
distant
i
was
told
that
the

of
large
extent
that
there
were
no
columns
standing
but
that
large
ones
were
lying
upon
the

intended
again
to
cross
the

in
order
to
see
the
ruins
of

from
thence
to
visit
the

were
shewn

but
went
astray
and
did
not
reach
beit

one
hour

a
half
by

i
took
a
guide
from

me
to

i
was

inhabited
by
several

there
intended

the
night
and
to
proceed
the
next
day
to
feik
a
village
on
the
side
of
the
lake
of

in
half
an
hour
from

we
passed
the

in
a

farther
to
the
joins
the

and
still
lower
down
unites
with
the

one
hour

was
the
village

runs
in

half
an

begins
that
of

at
one
hour

a
half
to

half
an
hour
we
saw
in

the

cultivate
a

there
are
several

is
uneven
ground
rising
towards
the
west

is
intersected
by
many
wadys
at
the

three
hours

a
quarter
we
reached
om

om

is
the
last
village
to

situated
near

bound
the

bears
to
the
of

one
hour
is
the
deep
wady
called

is
beyond
a
doubt
the
hieromax

sheriat
in
the
valley
of

not
far
from
the
junction
of
the
latter
with
the
jordan
i
am
doubtful
to
what
ancient
city
the
ruins
of
om

are
to
be
ascribed
it
was
probably
gamala
which
josephus
describes
as
standing
upon

the

the
ancient

was
situated
round
a
hill
which
is
the
highest
point
in
the
neighbourhood
to
the
east
of
the
hill
are
a
great
number
of
caverns
in
the
calcareous
rock
some
of
which
have
been
enlarged
and
rendered
habitable
others
have
been
used
as
sepulchral
caves
great
numbers
of
sarcophagi
are
lying
about
in
this
direction
they
are
all
of
black
stone
which
must
have
been
transported
from
the
banks
of
the

the
dimensions
of
the
largest
are
nine
spans
in
length
by
three
in
breadth
they
are
ornamented
with
of

festoons
wreaths
of

and
some
with

but
very
few
of
them
are
of
elegant

i
counted
upwards
of
seventy
on
the
declivity
of

on
the
summit
of

are
heaps
of
wrought
stones
but
no
remains
of
any
important
building
on
its
west
and
north
sides
are
the
remains
of
two
large
theatres
built
entirely
of
black
stone
that
on
the
side
is
in
better
preservation
than
the
other
although
more
ruined
than
the
theatres
at

the

the
greater
part
of
the

yet
remain
a
tier
of
boxes
intervenes
between
the
rows
of

as
at

and
there
are
deep
vaulted
apartments
beneath
the

there
are
no
remains
of
columns
in
front
of
either
theatre
the
theatre
on
the
north
side
of
the
hill
which
is
in
a
very
dilapidated
state
is
remarkable
for
its
great
depth
caused
by
its
being
built
on
a
part
of
the
steepest
declivity
of
the

its
uppermost
row
of

is
at

forty
feet
higher
than
the
lowest
the
area
below
the

is
comparatively
very
small
from
these
two
theatres
the
principal
part
of
the
town
appears
to
have
extended
westwards
over
an
even
piece
of
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
its
length
from
the
hill
was
at
least
half
an
hour
nothing
is
at
present
standing
but
there
are
immense
heaps
of
cut
stones
columns
dispersed
over
the
plain
a
long
street
running
westward
of
which
the
ancient
pavement
still
exists
in
most
parts
seems
to
have
been
the
principal
street
of
the
town
on
both
sides
there
are
vast
quantities
of
shafts
of
columns
at
a
spot
where
a
heap
of
large
corinthian
pillars
lay
a
temple
appears
to
have
stood
i
here
saw
the
base
of
a
large
column
of
gray
granite
the
town
terminates
in
a
narrow
point
where
a
large
solid
building
with
many
columns
seems
to
have
stood
with
the
exception
of
the
theatres
the
buildings
of
the
city
were
all
constructed
of
the
calcareous
stone
which
constitutes
the
rock
of
every
part
of
the
country
which
i
saw
between
wady
zerka
sheriat
el
mandhour
and
wady
sheriat
in
djebel
adjeloun
moerad
and
beni
obeid
none
of
the
basalt
or
black
stone
is
met
with
but
in
some
parts
of
el
kefarat
in
our
way
from
hebras
to
om
keis
i
saw
alternate
layers
of
calcareous
and
basaltic
rock
with
thin
strata
of
flint
the
habitations
of
om
keis
are
for
the
greater
part
caverns
there
is
no
water
but
what
is
collected
in
reservoirs
during
rains
these
were
quite
dried
up
which
was
the
occasion
perhaps
of
the
place
having
been
abandoned
for
we
found
not
a
single
inhabitant
my
guide
being
ignorant
of
the
road
to
feik
wished
to
return
to
hebras
and
i
was
hesitating
what
to
do
when
we
were
met
by
some
peasants
of
remtha
in
the
haouran
who
were
in
their
way
to
the
ghor
to
purchase
new
barley
of
which
grain
the
harvest
had
already
begun
in
the
hot
climate
of
that
valley
i
joined
their
little
caravan
we
continued
for
about
half
an
hour
from
om
keis
upon
the
high
plain
and
then
descended
the
mountains
the
western
declivity
of
which
is
entirely
basaltic
at
the
end
of
two
hours
from
om
keis
we
reached
the
banks
of
the
sheriat
el
mandhour
or
sheriat
el
menadhere
arabic
or
arabic
which
we
passed
at
a
ford
this
river
takes
the
additional
name
of
the
arabs
who
live
upon
its
banks
to
distinguish
it
from
the
sheriat
el
kebir
great
sheriat
by
which
the
jordan
is
known
the
sheriat
el
menadhere
is
formed
by
the
united
streams
of
the
nahr
rokad
arabic
which
flows
from
near
ain
shakhab
through
the
eastern
parts
of
djolan
of
the
hereir
whose
source
is
in
the
swampy
ground
near
tel
dilly
on
the
hadj
route
between
shemskein
and
el
szannamein
of
the
budje
which
comes
from
mezareib
and
after
its
junction
with
the
hereir
is
called
aweired
arabic
and
of
the
wady
hamy
sakkar
besides
several
other
smaller
wadys
the
name
of
sheriat
is
first
applied
to
the
united
streams
near
szamme
from
thence
it
flows
in
a
deep
bed
of
tufwacke
and
its
banks
are
cultivated
by
the
arabs
menadhere
sing
mandhour
who
live
under
valley
of
the
ghor
tents
and
remove
from
place
to
place
but
without
quitting
the
banks
of
the
river
they
sow
wheat
and
barley
and
cultivate
pomegranates
lemons
grapes
and
many
kinds
of
fruit
and
vegetables
which
they
sell
in
the
villages
of
the
haouran
and
djolan
further
to
the
west
the
wady
becomes
so
narrow
as
to
leave
no
space
between
the
edge
of
the
stream
and
the
precipices
on
both
sides
it
issues
from
the
mountain
not
far
from
the
south
end
of
the
lake
of
tabaria
and
about
one
hour
lower
down
is
joined
by
the
wady
el
arab
it
then
empties
itself
into
the
jordan
called
sheriat
el
kebir
at
two
hours
distant
from
the
lake
is
therefore
wrong
in
making
it
flow
into
the
lake
itself
the
river
is
full
of
fish
and
in
the
wady
its
course
is
very
rapid
the
shrub
called
by
the
arabs
defle
arabic
grows
on
its
banks
it
has
a
red
flower
and
according
to
the
arabs
is
poisonous
to
cattle
the
breadth
of
the
stream
where
it
issues
from
the
mountains
is
about
paces
its
depth
in
the
month
of
may
between
four
and
five
feet
we
had
now
entered
the
valley
of
the
ghor
arabic
which
may
be
compared
to
the
valley
of
the
bekaa
between
the
libanus
and
libanus
and
the
valley
el
ghab
of
the
orontes
the
mountains
which
enclose
it
are
not
to
be
compared
in
magnitude
with
those
of
the
bekaa
but
the
abundance
of
its
waters
renders
its
aspect
more
pleasing
to
the
eye
and
may
make
its
soil
more
productive
it
is
one
of
the
lowest
levels
in
syria
lower
than
the
haouran
and
djolan
by
nearly
the
whole
height
of
the
eastern
mountains
its
temperature
is
hotter
than
i
had
experienced
in
any
other
part
of
syria
the
rocky
mountains
concentrating
the
heat
and
preventing
the
air
from
being
cooled
by
the
westerly
winds
in
summer
in
consequence
of
this
higher
degree
of
heat
the
productions
of
the
ghor
ripen
long
before
those
of
the
haouran
the
barley
harvest
which
does
not
begin
in
the
upper
plain
till
fifteen
days
later
szammagh
we
here
found
nearly
finished
the
haouran
on
the
other
hand
was
every
where
covered
with
the
richest
verdure
of
wild
herbage
while
every
plant
in
the
ghor
was
already
dried
up
and
the
whole
country
appeared
as
if
in
the
midst
of
summer
volney
has
justly
remarked
that
there
are
few
countries
where
the
changes
from
one
climate
to
another
are
so
sudden
as
in
syria
and
i
was
never
more
convinced
of
it
than
in
this
valley
to
the
north
was
the
djebel
el
sheikh
covered
with
snow
to
the
east
the
fertile
plainsof
djolan
clothed
in
the
blossoms
of
spring
while
to
the
south
the
withered
vegetation
of
the
ghor
seemed
the
effect
of
a
tropical
sun
the
breadth
of
the
valley
is
about
an
hour
and
a
half
or
two
hours
from
the
ford
over
the
sheriat
we
proceeded
across
the
plain
in
a
direction
it
was
covered
with
low
shrubs
and
a
tree
bearing
a
fruit
like
a
small
apple
very
agreeable
to
the
taste
zaarour
arabic
is
the
name
given
to
it
by
the
inhabitants
of
mount
libanus
those
of
damascus
call
it
zaaboub
arabic
and
the
arabs
have
also
another
name
for
it
which
i
forget
in
an
hour
and
upwards
from
the
ford
we
reached
the
village
szammagh
arabic
situated
on
the
most
southern
extremity
of
the
lake
of
tabaria
it
contains
thirty
or
forty
poor
mud
houses
and
a
few
built
with
black
stone
the
jordan
issues
out
of
the
lake
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
the
westward
of
the
village
where
the
lake
ends
in
a
straight
line
extending
for
about
forty
minutes
in
a
direction
nearly
east
and
west
from
hence
the
highest
point
of
djebel
el
sheikh
bears
the
town
of
szaffad
by
between
the
lake
and
the
first
bridge
over
the
jordan
called
djissr
el
medjami
at
about
two
hours
and
a
half
from
hence
are
two
fordable
passages
across
the
river
excepting
about
one
hundred
fedhans
around
szammagh
no
part
of
the
valley
is
cultivated
in
this
neighbourhood
somewhat
hot
wells
lower
down
begin
the
corn
fields
of
the
arabs
el
ghor
who
are
the
principal
inhabitants
of
the
valley
those
living
near
szammagh
are
the
arabs
el
sekhour
and
the
beshaatoue
the
only
villages
met
with
from
hence
as
far
as
beysan
the
ancient
scythopolis
are
to
the
left
of
the
jordan
maad
arabic
at
the
foot
of
djebel
wostye
and
el
erbayn
arabic
from
szammagh
to
beysan
the
valley
is
called
ghor
tabaria
i
swam
to
a
considerable
distance
in
the
lake
without
seeing
a
single
fish
i
was
told
however
that
there
were
privileged
fishermen
at
tabaria
who
monopolize
the
entire
fishery
the
beach
on
this
side
is
a
fine
gravel
of
quartz
flint
and
tufwacke
there
is
no
shallow
water
the
lake
being
of
considerable
depth
close
in
shore
the
only
species
of
shell
which
i
saw
on
the
beach
was
of
the
smallest
kind
white
and
about
an
inch
and
a
half
long
there
are
no
kinds
of
rushes
or
reeds
on
the
shores
in
this
neighbourhood
may
the
quantities
of
mosquitos
and
other
vermin
which
always
by
preference
attack
the
stranger
accustomed
to
more
northern
climates
made
me
pass
a
most
uncomfortable
night
at
szammagh
we
departed
early
in
the
morning
in
order
to
visit
the
hot
wells
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
of
om
keis
the
situation
of
which
had
been
pointed
out
to
me
on
the
preceding
day
returning
towards
the
place
where
the
sheriat
issues
from
the
wady
we
followed
up
the
river
from
thence
and
in
one
hour
and
three
quarters
from
szammagh
we
reached
the
first
the
river
flows
in
a
deep
bed
being
confined
in
some
places
on
both
sides
by
precipices
of
upwards
of
one
hundred
feet
in
height
whose
black
rocks
present
a
most
striking
contrast
with
the
verdure
on
their
summits
for
several
hundred
yards
before
we
arrived
at
the
i
perceived
a
strong
sulphureous
smell
in
the
air
the
spring
is
situated
in
a
very
narrow
plain
in
the
valley
between
the
river
and
the
northern
hot
wells
cliffs
which
we
descended
the
plain
had
been
covered
with
rich
herbage
but
it
was
now
dried
up
a
great
variety
of
shrubs
and
some
old
palm
trees
also
grow
here
the
heat
in
the
midst
of
the
summer
must
be
suffocating
the
spring
bubbles
up
from
a
basin
about
forty
feet
in
circumference
and
five
feet
in
depth
which
is
enclosed
by
ruins
of
walls
and
buildings
and
forms
below
a
small
rivulet
which
falls
at
a
short
distance
into
the
river
the
water
is
so
hot
that
i
found
it
difficult
to
keep
my
hand
in
it
it
deposits
upon
the
stones
over
which
it
flows
a
thick
yellow
sulphureous
crust
which
the
neighbouring
arabs
collect
to
rub
their
camels
with
when
diseased
just
above
the
basin
which
has
originally
been
paved
is
an
open
arched
building
with
the
broken
shaft
of
a
column
still
standing
and
behind
it
are
several
others
also
arched
which
may
have
been
apartments
for
the
accommodation
of
strangers
the
large
stones
forming
these
structures
are
much
decayed
from
the
influence
of
the
exhalations
this
spring
is
called
hammet
el
sheikh
arabic
and
is
the
hottest
of
them
all
at
five
minutes
distance
ascending
the
wady
is
a
second
of
the
same
kind
but
considerably
cooler
it
issues
out
of
a
basin
covered
with
weeds
and
surrounded
with
reeds
and
has
some
remains
of
ancient
buildings
about
it
it
is
called
hammet
errih
arabic
and
joins
the
waters
from
the
first
source
following
the
course
of
the
river
up
the
wady
eight
more
hot
springs
are
met
with
i
shall
here
mention
their
names

i
did
not

this

two
hours
and
a
half
these
feik
eight
springs
are
on
both
sides
of
the
wady
and
have
remains
of
ancient
buildings
near
them
i
conceive
that
a
naturalist
would
find
it
well
worth
his
time
to
examine
the
productions
of
this
wady
hitherto
almost
unknown
in
the
month
of
april
the
hammet
el
sheikh
is
visited
by
great
numbers
both
of
sick
and
healthy
people
from
the
neighbourhood
of
nablous
and
nazaret
who
prefer
it
to
the
bath
of
tabaria
they
usually
remain
about
a
fortnight
we
returned
from
the
hamme
by
the
same
road
we
came
on
reaching
the
plain
of
el
ghor
we
turned
to
our
right
up
the
mountain
we
here
met
a
wild
boar
of
great
size
these
animals
are
very
numerous
in
the
ghor
and
my
companions
told
me
that
the
arabs
of
the
valley
are
unable
to
cultivate
the
common
barley
called
here
shayr
araby
arabic
on
account
of
the
eagerness
with
which
the
wild
swine
feed
upon
it
they
are
therefore
obliged
to
grow
a
less
esteemed
sort
with
six
rows
of
grains
called
shayr
kheshaby
arabic
which
the
swine
do
not
touch
at
three
quarters
of
an
hour
from
the
spot
where
we
began
to
ascend
we
came
to
a
spring
called
ain
el
khan
near
a
khan
called
el
akabe
where
caravans
sometimes
alight
this
being
the
great
road
from
the
djolan
and
the
northern
parts
of
the
haouran
to
the
ghor
akabe
is
a
general
term
for
a
steep
descent
in
one
hour
we
passed
a
spring
called
ain
el
akabe
more
copious
than
the
former
from
thence
we
reached
the
summit
of
the
mountain
one
hour
and
a
quarter
distant
from
its
foot
where
the
plain
commences
and
in
one
hour
and
three
quarters
more
entered
the
village
of
feik
distant
about
four
hours
and
a
half
from
szammagh
by
the
road
we
travelled
one
hour
to
the
of
szammagh
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
lies
the
village
kherbet
szammera
arabic
with
some
ancient
buildings
it
is
the
only
inhabited
village
on
the
side
of
the
lake
its
site
seems
to
correspond
with
that
of
the
ancient
hippos
farther
north
near
the
shore
are
the
ruined
places
called
doeyrayan
arabic
and
telhoun
arabic
three
quarters
of
an
hour
to
the
of
khan
el

near
the
summit
of
the
mountain
lies
the
half
ruined
but
still
inhabited
village
of

the
country
to
the
north
of
the

eastwards
towards
the
haouran
feik
is
a
considerable
village
inhabited
by
more
than
two
hundred
families
it
is
situated
at
the
head
of
the
wady
of
the
same
name
on
the
ridge
of
a
part
of
the
mountain
which
incloses
the
shore
of
the
lake
of
tabaria
and
it
enjoys
a
fine
view
over
the
middle
part
of
the
lake
the
rivulet
of
feik
has
three
sources
issuing
from
beneath
a
precipice
round
the
summit
of
which
the
village
is
built
in
the
shape
of
a
crescent
having
descended
the
hill
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
a
steep
insulated
hill
is
met
with
having
extensive
ruins
of
buildings
walls
and
columns
on
its
top
they
are
called
el
hossn
and
are
perhaps
the
remains
of
the
ancient
town
of
regaba
or
argob
feik
arabic
although
situated
in
the
plain
of
djolan
does
not
actually
belong
to
that
district
but
constitutes
a
territory
of
itself
it
forms
part
of
the
government
of
akka
and
is
i
believe
the
only
place
belonging
to
that
pashalik
on
the
side
of
the
jordan
it
was
separated
from
the
pashalik
of
damascus
by
djezzar
pasha
there
being
a
constant
passage
through
feik
from
the
haouran
to
tabaria
and
akka
more
than
thirty
houses
in
the
town
have
open
menzels
for
the
entertainment
of
strangers
of
every
description
and
supply
their
cattle
gratis
the
landlords
have
an
allowance
from
the
government
for
their
expenses
which
is
made
by
a
deduction
from
the
customary
taxes
and
if
the
menzel
is
much
frequented
as
in
the
case
of
that
of
the
sheikh
no
miri
at
all
is
collected
from
the
landlord
and
the
pasha
makes
him
also
an
yearly
allowance
in
money
out
of
the
miri
of
the
village
the
establishment
of
these
public
menzels
which
are
general
over
the
whole
country
to
the
of
damascus
does
great
honour
to
the
hospitable
spirit
of
the
turks
but
it
is
in
fact
the
only
expense
that
the
government
thinks
itself
obliged
to
incur
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
of
the
country
a
peasant
can
travel
for
a
whole
month
without
expending
a
para
but
people
of
any
distinction
give
a
few
paras
on
the
morning
of
their
departure
to
the
waiter
or
watchman
arabic
if
the
traveller
does
not
choose
to
alight
at
a
public
menzel
he
may
go
to
any
private
house
where
he
will
find
a
hospitable
landlord
and
as
good
a
supper
as
the
circumstances
of
his

can
afford
i
observed
upon

to
be
the

its

do
not
quite
correspond
with
those
of
the

to
a
narrow
strip
of
land
along
the

the
eastern

the

have
formed

the

presented
me
with
a
fruit

grows
wild
in

is
unknown
in

even
at

it
is
of

full
of

i
did

by

by
several

generally
sends

also
the

the
druses
are
not
under
the

correspond
directly
with
the

they
have
a

office
though
subject
to
the

of
the

has
been
hereditary
from
a
remote
period
in

the
turks
and

have
exactly
the
same
modes
of
life
but
the
druses
are
distinguished
from
them
in
many
respects
the
two
former
very
nearly
resemble
the
arabs
in
their
customs
and
manners
their
ordinary
dress
is
precisely
that
of
the
arabs

and

naked
they
have
also
adopted
for
the
greater
part
the
bedouin
dialect
gestures
and
phraseology
according
to
which
most
articles
of
housebold
furniture
have
names
different
from
those
in
the
towns
it
requires
little
experience
however
to
distinguish
the
adults
of
the
two
nations
from
one
another
the
arabs
are
generally
of
short
stature
with
thin
visage
scanty
beard
and
brilliant
black
eyes
while
the
fellahs
are
taller
and
stouter
with
a
strong
beard
and
a
less
piercing
look
but
the
difference
seems
chiefly
to
arise
from
their
mode
of
life
for
the
youth
of
both
nations
to
the
age
of
sixteen
have
precisely
the
same
appearance
the
turks
and
christians
of
the
haouran
live
and
dress
alike
and
religion
seems
to
occasion
very
little
difference
in
their
respective
conditions
when
quarrels
happen
the
christian
fears
not
to
strike
the
turk
or
to
execrate
his
religion
a
liberty
which
in
every
town
of
syria
would
expose
the
christian
to
the
penalty
of
death
or
to
a
very
heavy
pecuniary
fine
common
sufferings
and
dangers
in
the
defence
of
their
property
may
have
given
rise
to
the
toleration
which
the
christians
enjoy
from
the
turks
in
the
haouran
and
which
is
further
strengthened
by
the
druses
who
shew
equal
respect
to
both
religions
of
the
christians
are
greeks
and
the
only
religious
animosities
which
i
witnessed
during
my
tour
were
between
them
and
the
catholics
among
the
fellahs
of
the
haouran
the
richest
lives
like
the
poorest
and
displays
his
superior
wealth
only
on
the
arrival
of
strangers
the
ancient
buildings
afford
spacious
and
convenient
dwellings
to
many
of
the
modern
inhabitants
and
those
who
occupy
them
may
have
three
or
four
rooms
for
each
family
but
in
newly
built
villages
the
whole
family
with
all
its
household
furniture
cooking
utensils
and
provision
chests
is
commonly
huddled
together
in
one
apartment
here
also
they
keep
their
wheat
and
barley
in
reservoirs
formed
of
clay
called
kawara
arabic
which
are
about
five
feet
high
and
two
feet
in
diameter
the
chief
articles
of
furniture
are
a
handmill
which
is
used
in
summer
when
there
is
no
water
in
the
wadys
to
drive
the
mills
some
copper
kettles
and
a
few
mats
in
the
richer
houses
some
woollen
lebaet
are
met
with
which
are
coarse
woollen
stuffs
used
for
carpets
and
in
winter
for
cloths
real
carpets
or
mattrasses
are
seldom
seen
unless
it
be
upon
the
arrival
of
strangers
of
consequence
their
goat
hair
sacks
and
horse
and
camel
equipments
are
of
the
same
kind
as
those
used
by
the
bedouins
and
are
known
by
the
same
names
each
family
has
a
large
earthen
jar
of
the
manufacture
of
rasheiat
el
fukhar
which
is
filled
every
morning
by
the
females
from
the
birket
or
spring
with
water
for
the
day
consumption
in
every
house
there
is
a
room
for
the
reception
of
strangers
called
from
this
circumstance
medhafe
it
is
usually
that
in
which
the
male
part
of
the
family
sleeps
in
the
midst
of
it
is
a
fire
place
to
boil
coffee
the
most
common
dishes
of
these
people
are
burgoul
and
keshk
in
summer
they
supply
the
place
of
the
latter
by
milk
leben
and
fresh
butter
of
the
burgoul
i
have
spoken
on
other
occasions
there
are
two
kinds
of
keshk
and
the
first
is
prepared
by
putting
leaven
into
the
burgoul
and
pouring
water
over
it
it
is
then
left
until
almost
putrid
and
afterwards
spread
out
in
the
sun
to
dry
after
which
it
is
pounded
and
when
called
for
served
up
mixed
with
oil
or
butter
the
is
prepared
by
putting
leben
into
the
burgoul
instead
of
leaven
in
other
respects
the
process
is
the
same
keskh
and
bread
are
the
common
breakfast
and
towards
sunset
a
plate
of
burgoul
or
some
arab
dish
forms
the
dinner
in
honour
of
strangers
it
is
usual
to
serve
up
at
breakfast
melted
butter
and
bread
or
fried
eggs
and
in
the
evening
a
fowl
boiled
in
burgoul
or
a
kid
or
lamb
but
this
does
not
very
often
happen
the
women
and
children
eat
up
whatever
the
men
have
left
on
their
plates
the
women
dress
in
the
bedouin
manner
they
have
a
veil
over
the
head
but
seldom
veil
their
faces
hospitality
to
strangers
is
another
characteristic
common
to
the
arabs
and
to
the
people
of
haouran
a
traveller
may
alight
at
any
house
he
pleases
a
mat
will
be
immediately
spread
for
him
coffee
made
and
a
breakfast
or
dinner
set
before
him
in
entering
a
village
it
has
often
happened
to
me
that
several
persons
presented
themselves
each
begging
that
i
would
lodge
at
his
house
and
this
hospitality
is
not
confined
to
the
traveller
himself
his
horse
or
his
camel
is
also
fed
the
first
with
half
or
three
quarters
of
a
moud
the
moud
is
about
nineteen
pounds
english
of
barley
the
second
with
straw
with
this
part
of
their
hospitality
however
i
had
often
reason
to
be
dissatisfied
less
than
a
moud
being
insufficient
upon
a
journey
for
a
horse
which
is
fed
only
in
the
evening
according
to
the
custom
of
these
countries
as
it
would
be
considered
an
affront
to
buy
any
corn
the
horse
must
remain
unless
the
traveller
has
the
precaution
to
carry
a
little
barley
in
his
to
make
up
the
deficiency
in
the
host
allowance
on
returning
to
aaere
to
the
house
of
the
sheikh
after
my
tour
through
the
desert
one
of
my
druse
guides
insisted
upon
taking
my
horse
to
his
stables
instead
of
the
sheikh
when
i
was
about
to
depart
the
druse
brought
my
horse
to
the
door
and
when
i
complained
that
he
had
fallen
off
greatly
in
the
few
days
i
had
remained
in
the
village
the
sheikh
said
to
me
in
the
presence
of
several
persons
you
are
ignorant
of
the
ways
of
this
country
arabic
if
you
see
that
your
host
does
not
feed
your
horse
insist
upon
his
giving
him
a
moud
of
barley
daily
he
dares
not
refuse
it
it
is
a
point
of
honour
with
the
host
never
to
accept
of
the
smallest
return
from
a
guest
i
once
only
ventured
to
give
a
few
piastres
to
the
child
of
a
very
poor
family
at
zahouet
by
whom
we
had
been
most
hospitably
treated
and
rode
off
without
attending
to
the
cries
of
the
mother
who
insisted
upon
my
taking
back
the
money
besides
the
private
habitations
which
offer
to
every
traveller
a
secure
night
shelter
there
is
in
every
village
the
medhafe
of
the
sheikh
where
all
strangers
of
decent
appearance
are
received
and
entertained
it
is
the
duty
of
the
sheikh
to
maintain
this
medhafe
which
is
like
a
tavern
with
the
difference
that
the
host
himself
pays
the
bill
the
sheikh
has
a
public
allowance
to
defray
these
expenses
and
hence
a
man
of
the
haouran
intending
to
travel
about
for
a
fortnight
never
thinks
of
putting
a
single
para
in
his
pocket
he
is
sure
of
being
every
where
well
received
and
of
living
better
perhaps
than
at
his
own
home
a
man
remarkable
for
his
hospitality
and
generosity
enjoys
the
highest
consideration
among
them
the
inhabitant
of
the
haouran
estimates
his
wealth
by
the
number
of
fedhans
the
word
fedhan
is
applied
both
to
the
yoke
of
oxen
and
to
the
quantity
of
land
cultivated
by
them
which
varies
according
to
circumstances
in
some
parts
of
syria
chiefly
about
homs
the
fedhan
el
roumy
or
greek
fedhan
is
used
which
means
two
pair
of
oxen
or
pairs
of
cows
or
oxen
which
he
employs
in
the
cultivation
of
his
fields
if
it
is
asked
whether
such
a
one
has
piastres
illou
gheroush
arabic
a
common
mode
of
speaking
the
answer
is
a
great
deal
he
drives
six
pair
of
oxen
kethiar
bimashi
sette
fedhadhin
arabic
there
are
but
few
however
who
have
six
pair
of
oxen
a
man
with
two
or
three
is
esteemed
wealthy
and
such
a
one
has
probably
two
camels
perhaps
a
mare
or
at
least
a
gedish
a
gelding
or
a
couple
of
asses
and
forty
or
fifty
sheep
or
goats
the
fertility
of
the
soil
in
the
haouran
depends
entirely
upon
the
water
applied
to
it
in
districts
where
there
is
plenty
of
water
for
irrigation
the
peasants
sow
winter
and
summer
seeds
but
where
they
have
to
depend
entirely
upon
the
rainy
season
for
a
supply
nothing
can
be
cultivated
in
summer
the
harvest
in
the
latter
districts
therefore
is
in
proportion
to
the
abundance
of
the
winter
rains
the
first
harvest
is
that
of
arabic
at
the
end
of
april
of
these
there
are
vast
tracts
sown
the
produce
of
which
serve
as
food
for
the
cows
and
sheep
camels
are
fed
with
the
flour
made
from
these
beans
mixed
with
barley
meal
and
made
into
a
paste
next
comes
the
barley
harvest
and
towards
the
end
of
may
the
wheat
in
the
interval
between
the
two
last
the
peasants
eat
barley
bread
in
abundant
years
wheat
sells
at
fifty
piastres
the
gharara
three
rotola
and
a
half
make
a
moud
and
eighty
moud
a
gharara
a
rotola
is
equal
to
about
five
and
a
halfpounds
english
or
about
two
pounds
ten
shillings
for
fifteen
cwt
english
in
the
gharara
rose
as
high
as
to
one
hundred
and
ninety
piastres
the
wheat
of
the
haouran
is
considered
equal
if
not
superior
to
any
other
in
syria
barley
is
generally
not
more
than
half
the
price
of
wheat
when
i
was
in
the
haouran
the
price
of
an
ox
or
cow
was
about
seventy
piastres
that
of
a
camel
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
piastres
the
lands
which
are
not
capable
of
artificial
irrigation
are
generally
suffered
to
lie
fallow
one
year
a
part
of
them
is
sometimes
sown
in
spring
with
sesamum
cucumbers
melons
and
pulse
but
a
large
part
of
the
fruit
and
vegetables
consumed
in
the
haouran
is
brought
from
damascus
or
from
the
arabs
menadhere
who
cultivate
gardens
on
the
banks
of
the
sheriat
el
mandhour
the
peasants
of
haouran
are
extremely
shy
in
speaking
of
the
produce
of
their
land
from
an
apprehension
that
the
stranger
enquiries
may
lead
to
new
extortions
i
have
reason
to
believe
however
that
in
middling
years
wheat
yields
fold
in
some
parts
of
the
haouran
this
year
the
barley
has
yielded
and
even
in
some
instances
eighty
a
sheikh
who
formerly
inhabited
the
small
village
of
boreika
on
the
southern
borders
of
the
ledja
assured
me
that
from
twenty
mouds
of
he
once
obtained
thirty
ghararas
or
one
hundred
and
twenty
fold
fields
watered
by
rain
the
arabs
call
them
boal
arabic
yield
more
in
proportion
to
the
seed
sown
than
those
which
are
artificially
watered
this
is
owing
to
the
seed
being
sown
thinner
in
the
former
the
haouran
crops
are
sometimes
destroyed
by
mice
arabic
though
not
so
frequently
as
in
the
neighbourhood
of
homs
and
hamah
where
abundance
of
water
may
be
conducted
into
the
fields
from
neighbouring
springs
the
soil
is
again
sown
after
the
grain
harvests
with
vegetables
lentils
peas
sesamums
the
fellahs
who
own
fedhans
often
cultivate
one
another
fields
in
company
a
turk
living
in
a
druse
village
often
wishes
to
have
a
druse
for
his
companion
to
escape
in
some
degree
the
vexations
of
the
druse
sheikh
at
the
druse
sheikhs
black
slaves
are
frequently
met
with
but
the
turk
and
christian
proprietors
cultivate
their
lands
by
hired
native
labourers
sometimes
the
labourer
contracts
with
a
townsman
and
receives
from
him
oxen
ploughs
and
seed
a
labourer
who
has
one
fedhan
or
two
oxen
under
his
charge
usually
receives
at
the
time
of
sowing
one
gharara
of
corn
after
the
harvest
he
takes
of
the
produce
of
the
field
but
among
the
druses
only
a
fourth
the
master
pays
to
the
government
the
tax
called
miri
and
the
labourer
pays
ten
piastres
annually
the
rest
of
the
agricultural
population
of
the
haouran
consists
of
those
who
subsist
by
daily
labour
they
in
general
earn
their
living
very
hardly
i
once
met
with
a
young
man
who
had
served
eight
years
for
his
food
only
at
the
expiration
of
that
period
he
obtained
in
marriage
the
daughter
of
his
master
for
whom
he
would
otherwise
have
had
to
pay
seven
or
eight
hundred
piastres
when
i
saw
him
he
had
been
married
three
years
but
he
complained
bitterly
of
his
who
continued
to
require
of
him
the
performance
of
the
most
servile
offices
without
paying
him
any
thing
and
thus
prevented
him
from
setting
up
for
himself
and
family
daughters
are
paid
for
according
to
the
respectability
of
their
father
sometimes
as
high
as
fifteen
hundred
piastres
and
this
custom
prevails
amongst
druses
turks
and
christians
if
her
family
is
rich
the
girl
is
fitted
out
with
clothes
and
a
string
of
zequins
or
of
silver
coin
to
tie
round
her
head
after
which
she
is
delivered
to
her
husband
i
had
an
opportunity
of
witnessing
an
espousal
of
two
christians
at
aaere
in
the
house
of
a
christian
the
bride
was
brought
with
her
female
friends
and
relations
from
her
native
village
one
day
journey
distant
with
two
camels
decorated
with
tassels
bells
and
was
lodged
with
her
relations
in
aaere
they
entered
the
village
preceded
by
women
beating
the
tamborine
and
by
the
village
youths
firing
off
their
musquets
soon
afterwards
the
bridegroom
retired
to
the
spring
which
was
in
a
field
ten
minutes
from
the
village
where
he
washed
and
dressed
himself
in
new
clothes
he
then
entered
the
village
mounted
on
a
caparisoned
horse
surrounded
by
young
men
two
of
whom
beat
tamborines
and
the
others
fired
musquets
he
alighted
before
the
sheikh
house
and
was
carried
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
by
two
men
on
their
arms
amidst
continued
singing
and
huzzaing
the
sheikh
then
exclaimed
mebarek
el
aris
arabic
blessed
be
the
bridegroom
which
was
repeated
by
all
present
after
which
he
was
set
down
and
remained
till
sunset
exposed
to
the
jests
of
his
friends
after
this
he
was
carried
to
the
church
where
the
greek
priest
performed
the
marriage
ceremony
and
the
young
couple
retired
to
their
dwelling
the
bridegroom
father
had
slaughtered
several
lambs
and
kids
a
part
of
which
was
devoured
by
day
but
the
best
pieces
were
brought
in
three
enormous
dishes
of
bourgul
to
the
sheikh
medhafe
two
being
for
the
mob
and
the
third
for
the
sheikh
and
principal
men
of
the
village
in
the
evening
paras
were
collected
by
one
of
the
bridegroom
friends
who
sung
verses
in
praise
of
all
his
acquaintance
every
one
of
whom
when
named
was
expected
to
make
a
present
the
oppressions
of
the
government
on
one
side
and
those
of
the
bedouins
on
the
other
have
reduced
the
fellah
of
the
haouran
to
a
state
little
better
than
that
of
the
wandering
arab
few
individuals
either
among
the
druses
or
christians
die
in
the
same
village
in
which
they
were
born
families
are
continually
moving
from
one
place
to
another
in
the
first
year
of
their
new
settlement
the
sheikh
acts
with
moderation
towards
them
but
his
vexations
becoming
in
a
few
years
insupportable
they
fly
to
some
other
place
where
they
have
heard
that
their
brethren
are
better
treated
but
they
soon
find
that
the
same
system
prevails
over
the
whole
country
sometimes
it
is
not
merely
the
pecuniary
extortion
but
the
personal
enmity
of
the
sheikh
or
of
some
of
the
head
men
of
the
village
which
drives
a
family
from
their
home
for
they
are
always
permitted
to
depart
this
continued
wandering
is
one
of
the
principal
reasons
why
no
village
in
the
haouran
has
either
orchards
or
trees
or
gardens
for
the
growth
of
vegetables
shall
we
sow
for
strangers
was
the
answer
of
a
fellah
to
whom
i
once
spoke
on
the
subject
and
who
by
the
word
strangers
meant
both
the
succeeding
inhabitants
and
the
arabs
who
visit
the
haouran
in
the
spring
and
summer
the
taxes
which
all
classes
of
fellahs
in
the
haouran
pay
may
be
classed
under
four
heads
the
miri
the
expense
of
feeding
soldiers
on
the
march
the
tribute
to
the
arabs
and
extraordinary
contributions
the
miri
is
levied
upon
the
fedhan
thus
if
a
village
pay
twelve
purses
to
the
miri
and
there
are
thirty
pair
of
oxen
in
it
the
master
of
each
pair
pays
a
thirtieth
every
village
being
rated
for
the
miri
in
the
book
of
the
pasha
at
a
fixed
sum
that
sum
is
levied
as
long
as
the
village
is
at
all
inhabited
however
few
may
be
its
inhabitants
in
the
spring
of
every
year
or
if
no
strangers
have
arrived
and
settled
in
every
second
or
third
spring
the
ground
of
the
village
is
measured
by
long
cords
when
every
fellah
occupies
as
much
of
it
as
he
pleases
there
being
always
more
than
sufficient
the
amount
of
his
tax
is
then
fixed
by
the
sheikh
at
the
ratio
which
his
number
of
fedhans
bears
to
the
whole
number
of
fedhans
cultivated
that
year
whether
the
oxen
be
strong
or
weak
or
whether
the
quantity
of
seed
sown
or
of
land
cultivated
by
the
owner
of
the
oxen
be
more
or
less
is
not
taken
into
consideration
the
fellah
is
supposed
to
keep
strong
cattle
and
plough
as
much
land
as
possible
some
sow
six
gharara
of
wheat
or
barley
in
the
fedhan
others
five
and
others
seven
the
boundaries
of
the
respective
fields
are
marked
by
large
stones
arabic
the
miri
is
paid
in
kind
or
in
money
at
the
will
of
the
pasha
the
fellahs
prefer
the
latter
by
which
they
are
always
trifling
gainers
from
what
has
been
said
it
is
evidently
impossible
for
the
fellah
to
foresee
the
amount
of
miri
which
he
shall
have
to
pay
in
any
year
and
in
addition
to
this
vexation
the
miri
for
each
village
though
it
is
never
diminished
upon
a
loss
of
inhabitants
is
sometimes
raised
upon
a
supposed
increase
of
population
or
upon
some
other
pretext
it
may
generally
be
remarked
that
the
villages
inhabited
by
the
druses
usually
pay
more
miri
than
those
in
the
plain
because
some
allowance
is
made
to
the
latter
in
consideration
of
the
tribute
which
they
are
obliged
to
pay
to
the
arabs
and
from
which
the
former
are
exempt
at
aaere
the
year
before
my
first
visit
the
fedhan
had
paid
one
hundred
and
fifty
piastres
at
ezra
one
hundred
and
eighty
and
at
some
villages
in
the
plain
one
hundred
and
twenty
in
the
year
the
miri
including
some
extra
demands
amounted
in
general
to
five
hundred
piastres
the
fedhan
the
second
tax
upon
the
fellahs
is
the
expense
of
feeding
soldiers
on
the
march
if
the
number
is
small
they
go
to
the
sheikh
medhafe
but
if
they
are
numerous
they
are
quartered
or
rather
quarter
themselves
upon
the
fellahs
in
the
former
case
barley
only
for
their
horses
is
supplied
by
the
peasant
while
the
sheikh
furnishes
provisions
for
the
men
but
the
peasant
is
not
much
benefited
by
this
regulation
for
the
soldiers
are
in
general
little
disposed
to
be
satisfied
with
the
frugal
fare
of
the
sheikh
and
demand
fowls
or
butcher
meat
which
must
be
supplied
by
the
village
on
their
departure
they
often
steal
some
article
belonging
to
the
house
the
proportion
of
barley
to
be
furnished
by
each
individual
to
the
soldiers
horses
depends
of
course
upon
the
number
of
horses
to
be
fed
and
of
fedhans
in
the
village
at
aaere
in
the
year
it
amounted
to
fifty
piastres
per
fedhan
the
sheikh
of
aaere
has
six
pair
of
oxen
for
which
he
pays
no
taxes
but
the
presence
of
strangers
and
troops
is
so
frequent
at
his
medhafe
that
this
exemption
had
not
been
thought
a
sufficient
remuneration
and
he
is
entitled
to
levy
in
addition
every
year
two
or
three
gharara
of
corn
each
gharara
being
in
common
years
worth
eighty
or
one
hundred
piastres
some
sheikhs
levy
as
much
as
ten
gharara
besides
being
exempted
from
taxation
for
eight
ten
or
twelve
pair
of
oxen
the
third
and
most
heavy
contribution
paid
by
the
peasants
is
the
tribute
to
the
arabs
the
fahely
serdie
beni
szakher
serhhan
who
are
constant
residents
in
the
haouran
as
well
as
most
of
the
numerous
tribes
of
aeneze
who
visit
the
country
only
in
the
summer
are
from
remote
times
entitled
to
certain
tributes
called
khone
brotherbood
from
every
village
in
the
haouran
in
return
for
this
khone
the
arabs
abstain
from
touching
the
harvest
of
the
village
and
from
driving
off
its
cattle
and
camels
when
they
meet
them
in
their
way
each
village
pays
khone
to
one
sheikh
in
every
tribe
the
village
is
then
known
as
his
ukhta
arabic
or
sister
as
the
arabs
term
it
and
he
protects
the
inhabitants
against
all
the
members
of
his
own
tribe
it
may
easily
be
imagined
however
that
depredations
are
often
committed
without
the
possibility
of
redress
the
depredator
being
unknown
or
flying
immediately
towards
the
desert
the
amount
of
the
khone
is
continually
increasing
for
the
arab
sheikh
is
not
always
contented
with
the
quantity
of
corn
he
received
in
the
preceding
year
but
asks
something
additional
as
a
present
which
soon
becomes
a
part
of
his
accustomed
dues
if
the
pasha
of
damascus
were
guided
by
sound
policy
and
a
right
view
of
his
own
interests
he
might
soon
put
an
end
to
the
exactions
of
the
arabs
by
keeping
a
few
thousand
men
well
paid
in
garrison
in
the
principal
places
of
the
haouran
but
instead
of
this
his
object
is
to
make
the
khone
an
immediate
source
of
income
to
himself
the
chief
sheikhs
of
the
fehely
and
serdie
receive
yearly
from
the
pasha
a
present
of
a
pelisse
which
entitles
them
to
the
tribute
of
the
villages
out
of
which
the
fehely
pays
about
twenty
purses
and
the
serdie
twelve
purses
into
the
pasha
treasury
the
serdie
generally
regulate
the
amount
of
the
khone
which
they
levy
by
that
which
the
fehely
receive
and
take
half
as
much
but
the
khone
paid
to
the
aeneze
chiefs
is
quite
arbitrary
and
the
sum
paid
to
a
single
sheikh
varies
according
to
his
avidity
or
the
wealth
of
the
fellahs
from
thirty
and
forty
piastres
up
to
four
hundred
which
are
generally
paid
in
corn
these
various
oppressive
taxes
under
which
the
poor
fellah
groans
are
looked
upon
as
things
of
course
and
just
contributions
and
he
considers
himself
fortunate
if
they
form
the
whole
of
his
sufferings
but
it
too
often
happens
that
the
pasha
is
a
man
who
sets
no
bounds
to
his
rapacity
and
extraordinary
sums
are
levied
upon
the
village
by
the
simple
command
issued
from
the
hakim
el
haouran
to
the
village
sheikh
to
levy
three
or
four
hundred
piastres
upon
the
peasants
of
the
place
on
these
occasions
the
women
are
sometimes
obliged
to
sell
their
and
bracelets
and
the
men
their
cattle
to
satisfy
the
demand
and
have
no
other
hope
than
that
a
rich
harvest
in
the
following
year
shall
make
amends
for
their
loss
the
receipt
of
the
miri
of
the
whole
pashalik
of
damascus
is
in
the
hands
of
the
jew
bankers
or
serafs
of
the
pasha
who
have
two
and
a
half
per
cent
upon
his
revenue
and
as
much
upon
his
expenditure
they
usually
distribute
the
villages
amongst
their
creatures
who
repair
thither
at
the
time
of
harvest
to
receive
the
miri
and
who
generally
extort
besides
something
for
themselves
the
druses
who
inhabit
the
villages
in
the
loehf
and
those
on
the
sides
of
the
djebel
haouran
are
to
be
classed
with
the
fellahs
of
the
plain
with
regard
to
their
mode
of
living
and
their
relations
with
the
government
their
dress
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
fellahs
to
the
of
damascus
they
seldom
wear
the
keffie
and
the
grown
up
men
do
not
go
barefoot
like
the
other
fellahs
of
the
haouran
i
have
already
mentioned
that
their
chief
resides
at
soueida
of
which
village
he
is
also
the
sheikh
on
the
death
of
the
chief
the
individual
in
his
family
who
is
in
the
highest
estimation
from
wealth
or
personal
character
succeeds
to
the
title
and
is
confirmed
by
the
pasha
it
is
known
that
on
the
death
of
wehebi
el
hamdan
the
present
chief
who
is
upwards
of
eighty
shybely
el
hamdan
the
sheikh
of
aaere
will
succeed
him
the
chief
has
no
income
as
such
it
being
derived
from
the
village
of
which
he
is
sheikh
and
his
authority
over
the
others
goes
no
further
than
to
communicate
to
them
the
orders
of
the
pasha
in
manners
these
druses
very
much
resemble
those
of
the
mountains
of
kesrouan
the
families
form
clans
almost
independent
of
each
other
and
among
whom
there
are
frequent
quarrels
insults
are
studiously
avenged
by
the
respective
families
and
the
law
of
is
in
full
force
among
them
without
being
mitigated
by
the
admission
of
any
pecuniary
commutation
they
all
go
armed
as
do
the
turks
and
christians
of
the
haouran
in
general
few
druses
have
more
than
one
wife
but
she
may
be
divorced
on
very
slight
pretexts
with
respect
to
their
religion
the
druses
of
the
haouran
like
those
in
mount
libanus
have
the
class
of
men
called
akoul
sing
aakel
who
are
distinguished
from
the
rest
by
a
white
turban
and
the
peculiarity
of
the
folds
in
which
they
wear
it
the
akoul
are
not
permitted
to
smoke
tobacco
they
never
swear
and
are
very
reserved
in
their
manners
and
conversation
i
was
informed
that
these
were
their
only
obligations
and
it
appears
probable
for
i
observed
akoul
boys
of
eight
or
ten
years
of
age
from
whom
nothing
more
difficult
could
well
be
expected
and
to
whom
it
is
not
likely
that
any
important
secret
would
be
imparted
i
have
seen
akouls
of
that
age
whose
fathers
were
not
of
the
order
because
as
they
told
me
they
could
not
abstain
from
smoking
and
swearing
the
sheikhs
are
for
the
greater
part
akouls
the
druses
pray
in
their
chapels
but
not
at
stated
periods
these
chapels
are
called
khalawe
arabic
an
insulated
place
and
none
but
druses
are
allowed
to
enter
them
they
affect
to
follow
the
doctrines
of
mohammed
but
few
of
them
pray
according
to
the
turkish
forms
they
fast
during
ramadan
in
the
presence
of
strangers
but
eat
at
their
own
homes
and
even
of
the
flesh
of
the
wild
boar
which
is
frequently
met
with
in
these
districts
it
is
a
singular
belief
both
among
the
western
druses
and
those
of
the
haouran
that
there
are
a
great
number
of
druses
in
england
an
opinion
founded
perhaps
upon
the
fanatical
opinions
of
the
christians
of
syria
who
deny
the
english
to
be
followers
of
christ
because
they
neither
confess
nor
fast
when
i
first
arrived
at
the
druse
village
of
aaere
there
was
a
large
company
in
the
medhafe
and
the
sheikh
had
no
opportunity
of
speaking
to
me
in
private
he
therefore
called
for
his
inkstand
and
wrote
upon
a
piece
of
paper
the
following
questions
which
i
answered
as
well
as
i
could
and
returned
him
the
paper
where
do
the
five
wadys
flow
to
in
your
country
do
you
know
the
grain
of
the
plant
leiledj
arabic
and
where
is
it
sown
what
is
the
name
of
the
sultan
of
china
are
the
towns
of
hadjar
and
nedjran
in
the
yemen
known
to
you
is
hadjar
in
ruins
and
who
will
rebuild
it
is
the
moehdy
the
saviour
yet
come
or
is
he
now
upon
the
earth
i
have
not
been
able
to
obtain
any
information
concerning
the
period
at
which
the
druses
first
settled
in
these
parts
min
kadim
arabic
a
long
time
ago
was
the
general
answer
of
all
those
whom
i
questioned
on
the
subject
during
my
stay
at
aaere
news
arrived
there
that
a
body
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
druses
had
left
the
western
mountains
and
were
coming
to
settle
in
haouran
the
pasha
of
damascus
has
entrusted
to
the
druses
of
the
haouran
the
defence
of
the
neighbouring
villages
against
such
of
the
arabs
as
may
be
at
war
with
him
but
the
druses
perform
this
service
very
badly
they
are
the
secret
friends
of
all
the
arabs
to
whom
they
abandon
the
villages
of
the
plain
on
the
condition
that
their
own
brethren
are
not
to
be
molested
and
their
sheikhs
receive
from
the
arabs
presents
in
horses
cattle
and
butter
while
at
aaere
i
witnessed
an
instance
of
the
good
understanding
between
the
druses
and
the
arabs
serdie
whom
i
have
already
mentioned
as
having
been
at
war
with
the
pasha
at
the
time
of
my
visit
to
the
haouran
seeing
in
the
evening
some
arabs
stealing
into
the
of
the
sheikh
house
i
enquired
who
they
were
and
was
told
that
they
were
serdie
come
in
search
of
information
whether
any
more
troops
were
likely
to
be
sent
against
them
from
damascus
it
is
for
this
kind
of
treachery
that
the
fellahs
in
the
haouran
hate
the
druses
the
authority
both
of
the
druse
and
turkish
village
sheikh
is
very
limited
in
consequence
of
the
facility
with
which
the
fellahs
can
transport
themselves
and
families
to
another
village
i
was
present
during
a
dispute
between
a
christian
fellah
and
a
druse
chief
who
wished
to
make
the
former
pay
for
the
ensuing
year
at
the
rate
of
the
same
number
of
fedhans
that
he
had
paid
for
the
preceding
year
though
he
had
now
one
pair
of
oxen
less
after
much
wrangling
and
high
words
on
both
sides
the
christian
said
very
well
i
shall
not
sow
a
single
grain
but
retire
to
another
village
and
by
the
next
morning
he
had
made
preparation
for
his
departure
when
the
sheikh
having
called
upon
him
the
affair
was
amicably
settled
and
a
large
dish
of
rice
was
dressed
in
token
of
reconciliation
when
disputes
happen
between
druses
they
are
generally
settled
by
the
interference
of
mutual
friends
or
by
the
sheikhs
or
their
respective
families
or
by
the
great
chiefs
or
failing
these
the
two
families
of
the
two
parties
come
to
blows
rather
than
bring
their
differences
before
the
court
of
justice
at
damascus
among
the
turks
litigations
are
in
the
last
extremity
decided
by
the
kadhi
of
damascus
or
by
the
pasha
in
person
the
christians
often
bring
their
differences
before
the
tribunal
of
priests
or
that
of
the
patriarch
of
damascus
and
before
the
kadhi
in
times
when
it
is
known
that
christians
can
obtain
justice
which
is
not
the
case
under
every
governor
the
bedouins
of
the
haouran
are
of
two
classes
those
who
are
resident
and
those
who
visit
it
in
the
spring
and
summer
only
the
resident
arabs
are
the
fehily
arabic
serdie
arabic
beni
szakher
arabic
serhhan
arabic
the
arabs
of
the
mountain
haouran
or
ahl
el
djebel
arabic
and
those
of
the
ledja
arabic
by
resident
i
do
not
mean
a
fixed
residence
in
villages
but
that
their
wanderings
are
confined
to
the
haouran
or
to
some
particular
districts
of
it
thus
the
four
first
mentioned
move
through
every
part
of
the
country
from
zerka
up
to
the
plains
of
ard
zeikal
according
to
their
relations
with
other
tribes
their
own
affairs
and
the
state
of
pasturage
in
the
different
districts
the
beni
szakher
generally
encamp
at
the
foot
of
the
western
mountains
of
belka
and
the
heish
the
serhhan
near
them
and
the
fehily
and
serdie
in
the
midst
of
the
cultivated
districts
or
at
a
short
distance
from
them
according
to
the
terms
they
are
upon
with
the
pasha
when
i
was
in
the
haouran
the
fehliy
were
encamped
near
the
szaffa
the
beni
szakher
near
fedhein
the
serhhan
at
the
foot
of
the
belka
and
the
serdie
near
om
eddjemal
the
ahl
el
djebel
move
about
in
the
mountain
those
of
the
ledja
seldom
venture
to
encamp
beyond
their
usual
limits
in
that
district
but
i
have
spoken
more
largely
of
these
tribes
and
their
mutual
interests
in
another
place
the
fehily
and
serdie
are
called
ahl
el
dyrel
or
national
arabs
and
pay
tribute
to
the
pasha
who
however
is
often
at
war
with
them
for
withholding
it
or
for
plundering
his
troops
or
the
fellahs
if
the
pasha
happens
to
be
at
war
with
other
tribes
they
are
bound
to
join
his
troops
but
in
this
they
are
guided
entirely
by
the
advantage
which
they
are
likely
to
derive
from
the
contest
they
receive
khone
from
all
the
villages
of
the
haouran
the
djolan
and
many
of
those
in
the
djebel
adjeloun
the
ahl
el
djebel
and
the
arabs
el
ledja
are
kept
in
more
strict
dependence
upon
the
pasha
than
the
other
tribes
both
are
subject
to
an
annual
tribute
which
is
levied
on
each
tent
according
to
the
wealth
of
its
owner
this
is
collected
from
the
arabs
el
ledja
by
the
sheikh
of
the
fellahs
and
ascends
from
ten
to
sixty
piastres
for
each
tent
it
seldom
happens
that
the
arabs
el
djebel
prove
rebels
but
those
of
the
ledja
often
the
tribute
in
the
confidence
that
the
recesses
of
their
abode
can
not
he
forced
in
this
case
nothing
makes
them
yield
but
want
of
water
when
their
own
springs
failing
they
are
obliged
to
approach
the
perennial
sources
of
the
loehf
the
arabs
of
the
djebel
haouran
are
the
shepherds
of
the
people
of
the
plains
who
entrust
to
them
in
summer
and
winter
their
flocks
of
goats
and
sheep
which
they
pasture
during
the
latter
season
amongst
the
rocks
of
the
mountains
in
spring
the
arabs
return
the
flocks
to
their
owners
who
sell
a
part
of
them
at
damascus
or
make
butter
from
the
milk
during
the
spring
months
the
arabs
receive
for
their
trouble
of
the
lambs
and
kids
and
a
like
proportion
of
the
butter
casual
losses
in
the
flocks
are
borne
equally
by
both
parties
the
following
are
the
different
tribes
of
the
ahl
el
djebel
esshenabele
el
hassan
el
haddie
ghiath
essherefat
mezaid
el
kerad
beni
adhan
and
szammeral
of
those
of
the
ledja
i
have
already
spoken
the
ahl
el
djebel
are
always
at
peace
with
the
other
arabs
but
those
of
the
ledja
are
often
at
war
with
the
fehily
and
serdie
i
come
now
to
the
second
class
or
wandering
arabs
in
may
the
whole
haouran
is
coverered
with
swarms
of
wanderers
from
the
desert
who
remain
there
till
after
september
these
are
at
present
almost
exclusively
of
the
tribe
of
aeneze
formerly
the
haouran
was
often
visited
by
the
sherarat
from
the
mekka
road
at
fifteen
stations
from
damascus
by
the
shammor
from
djebel
shammor
and
by
the
dhofir
from
the
irak
country
on
the
arrival
of
the
aeneze
the
resident
arabs
who
may
happen
to
be
at
war
with
them
conceal
themselves
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
western
mountain
or
in
the
szaffa
or
they
retire
towards
mezareib
and
szannamein
the
aeneze
come
for
a
purpose
water
and
pasturage
for
the
summer
and
a
provision
of
corn
for
the
winter
if
they
are
at
peace
with
the
pasha
they
encamp
quietly
among
the
villages
near
the
springs
or
wells
if
at
war
with
him
for
their
relations
with
the
government
of
damascus
are
as
uncertain
as
their
own
with
each
other
they
keep
in
the
district
to
the
of
boszra
towards
om
eddjemal
and
fedhein
extending
their
limits
south
as
far
as
el
zerka
the
pasha
generally
permits
them
to
purchase
corn
from
the
haouran
but
in
years
when
a
scarcity
is
apprehended
a
restriction
is
put
upon
them
till
within
a
few
years
the
aeneze
were
the
constant
carriers
of
the
hadj
and
made
yearly
contracts
with
the
pasha
for
several
thousand
camels
by
which
they
were
considerable
gainers
as
well
as
by
the
fixed
tribute
which
many
of
their
sheikhs
had
made
themselves
entitled
to
from
the
pilgrim
caravan
and
by
their
nightly
plunder
of
stragglers
and
loaded
camels
during
the
march
these
advantages
have
made
the
aeneze
inclined
to
preserve
friendly
terms
with
the
pashalik
of
damascus
and
to
break
allegiance
to
the
wahabi
chief
notwithstanding
they
have
been
for
twelve
years
converts
to
his
religious
doctrines
if
however
they
shall
become
convinced
that
the
hadj
is
no
longer
practicable
they
will
soon
turn
their
arms
against
their
former
friends
an
event
which
is
justly
dreaded
by
the
people
of
the
haouran
the
tribe
of
aeneze
which
most
usually
visits
the
haouran
is
the
would
ali
under
their
chiefs
etteiar
and
ibn
ismayr
the
latter
has
at
present
more
interest
than
any
other
arab
sheikh
with
the
pasha
from
whom
he
occasionally
receives
considerable
presents
as
an
indemnification
for
his
losses
by
the
suspension
of
the
hadj
as
well
as
to
induce
him
to
keep
his
arabs
on
good
terms
with
the
turkish
governors
of
the
pashalik
description
of
a
journey
from
damascus
through
the
mountains
of
arabia
petraea
and
the
desert
el
ty
to
cairo
in
the
summer
of
wishing
to
obtain
a
further
knowledge
of
the
mountains
to
the
east
of
the
jordan
and
being
still
more
desirous
of
visiting
the
almost
unknown
districts
to
the
east
of
the
dead
sea
as
well
as
of
exploring
the
country
which
lies
between
the
latter
and
the
red
sea
i
resolved
to
pursue
that
route
from
damascus
to
cairo
in
preference
to
the
direct
road
through
jerusalem
and
ghaza
where
i
could
not
expect
to
collect
much
information
important
for
its
novelty
knowing
that
my
intended
way
led
through
a
diversity
of
bedouin
tribes
i
thought
it
advisable
to
equip
myself
in
the
simplest
manner
i
assumed
the
most
common
bedouin
dress
took
no
baggage
with
me
and
mounted
a
mare
that
was
not
likely
to
excite
the
cupidity
of
the
arabs
after
on
the
of
june
i
left
damascus
and
slept
that
night
at
kefer
souse

considerable

entered
into
a

kanneytra
is
now
in
ruins
having
been
deserted
by
its
inhabitants
since
the
period
of
the
passage
of
the
troops
into

it
is
enclosed
by
a
strong
wall
which
contains
within
its

a
good
khan
a
fine
mosque
with
several
short
columns
of
gray

and
a
copious

also
near

the
remains
of
a
small
ancient

consist
of
little
more
than
the
foundations
of

the
caravans
coming
from
akka
generally
halt
for
the
night
at
kanneytra
we
reposed
here
a
few
hours
and
then
continued
our
journey
over
ground
reservoirs

still
continues
to
rise
until
we
reached
the
chain
of
hills

form
the
most
conspicuous
part
of
the
mountain

the
ground
being
here
considerably
elevated
above
the
plain
of

the
djolan
these
hills
when
seen
from
afar
appear
like
mountains
although
when
viewed
from
their
foot
they
are
of
very
moderate
height
they
are
insulated
and
terminate
as
i
have
already
mentioned
at
the
hill

at
kanneytra
but
since
that
place
has
been
deserted
he
usually
encamps
with
the
turkmans
of

goes
from
one
encampment
to
another
to
collect
the

there

some
of

asserted
that
the

contained
a
spring
while
others
denied
it
from
which
i
inferred
that
the
water
never
dries
up
completely
i
take
this
to
be
the
lake
phiala
laid
down
in

of

there

no

a
neatly
built
town
situated
round
a
hill
on

a
castle

the
castle
appears
to
have
undergone
a
thorough
repair
in
the
course
of
the
last

it
has
a
good
wall

halfruined
walls
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
town
is
built
upon
several
low
hills
which
divide
it
into
different
quarters
of
these
the
largest
is
inhabited
exclusively
by
jews
who
esteem
szaffad
as
a
sacred
place

is
surrounded
with

occupations
of

i
had
no

to
any

was
obliged
to
lodge

public
coffee
house

left
the
town
early
in
the
morning

descended

lined

as

i
could
see

the

makes
it

empties
itself
into

just
by
beyond

we
came
to
a
ruined

near
the
borders
of

a
large
and
well
constructed

begins
a

about
twenty
minutes
in

stretches
down
close

covered
with
the
tree
called
doum
arabic

theder
arabic
which
bears
a
small
yellow
fruit
like
the
zaarour
it
was
now
about
and
the
sun
intensely
hot
we
therefore
looked
out
for
a
shady
spot
and
reposed
under
a
very
large
at
the
foot
of
which
a
rivulet
of
sweet
water
gushes
out
from
beneath
the
rocks
and
falls
into
the
lake
at
a
few
hundred
paces
distant
the
tree

given
its

near
it
are
several
other
springs
which
occasion
a
very
luxuriant
herbage
along
the
borders
of

the
pastures
of

proverbial
for
their
richness
among
the
inhabitants
of

neighbouring
countries
high
reeds
grow
along
the
shore
but
i
found
none
of
the
aromatic
reeds

shores
are
generally
sandy
without
reeds

large
quantities
grow
at
the
mouths
of

impedes
the

hence
intermittent

those

there

seem
to
indicate
that

turks
are
extremely
intolerant
at
tiberias
on
the
contrary
i
have
seen
christians
beating
turks
in
the
public
bazar
this
difference
seems
chiefly
to
depend
upon
the
character
of
the
local
government
that
of
soleiman
pasha
of
akka
the
successor
of
djezzar
is
distinguished
for
its
religious
tolerance
while
damascus
still
continues
to
be
the
seat
of
fanatism
and
will
remain
so
as
long
as
there
are
no
frank
establishments
or
european
agents
in
that
city
a
bazar
has
lately
been
built
at
tabaria
in
which
i
counted
about
a
dozen
retail
shops
the
traffic
of
the
inhabitants
is
principally
with
the
bedouins
of
the
ghor
and
of
the
district
of
szaffad
the
shopkeepers
repair
every
monday
to
the
khan
at
the
foot
of
mount
tabor
where
a
market
called
souk
el
khan
arabic
is
held
and
where
the
merchandize
of
the
town
is
bartered
chiefly
for
cattle
the
far
greater
part
of
the
inhabitants
of
tabaria
cultivate
the
soil
they
sow
the
narrow
plain
to
the
west
of
the
town
and
the
declivity
of
the
western
mountain
which
they
irrigate
artificially
by
means
of
several
springs
the
heat
of
the
climate
would
enable
them
to
grow
almost
any
tropical
plant
but
the
only
produce
of
their
fields
are
wheat
barley
dhourra
tobacco
melons
grapes
and
a
few
vegetables
the
melons
are
of
the
finest
quality
and
are
in
great
demand
at
akka
and
damascus
where
that
fruit
is
nearly
a
month
later
in
ripening
knowing
how
fond
the
syrians
in
general
are
of
the
early
fruits
i
sent
to
my
friends
at
damascus
a
mule
load
of
these
melons
which
according
to
eastern
fashion
is
a
very
acceptable
and
polite
present
about
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
weight
english
of
melons
sell
at
tabaria
for
about
eight
shillings
i
was
informed
that
the
shrub
which
produces
the
balm
of
mecca
succeeds
very
well
here
and
that
several
people
have
it
in
their
gardens
strabo
mentions
the
greek
as
growing
on
the
lake
ed
it
was
described
to
me
as
a
low
shrub
with
leaves
resembling
those
of
the
vine
the
fruit
about
three
inches
long
and
in
the
form
of
a
cucumber
changing
from
green
to
a
yellow
colour
when
ripe
it
is
gathered
in
june
oil
is
then
poured
over
it
and
in
this
state
it
is
exposed
to
the
sun
after
which
the
juic
e
forming
the
balm
is
expressed
from
it
the
jews
of
tiberias
occupy
a
quarter
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
in
the
middle
of
the
town
which
has
lately
been
considerably
enlarged
by
the
purchase
of
several
streets
it
is
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
town
by
a
high
wall
and
has
only
one
gate
of
entrance
which
is
regularly
shut
at
sunset
after
which
no
person
is
allowed
to
pass
there
are
one
hundred
and
sixty
or
two
hundred
families
of
which
forty
or
fifty
are
of
polish
origin
the
rest
are
jews
from
spain
barbary
and
different
parts
of
syria
tiberias
is
one
of
the
four
holy
cities
of
the
talmud
the
other
three
being
szaffad
jerusalem
and
hebron
it
is
esteemed
holy
ground
because
jacob
is
supposed
to
have
resided
here
and
because
it
is
situated
on
the
lake
genasereth
from
which
according
to
the
most
generally
received
opinion
of
the
talmud
the
messiah
is
to
rise
the
greater
part
of
the
jews
who
reside
in
these
holy
places
do
not
engage
in
mercantile
pursuits
but
are
a
society
of
religious
persons
occupied
solely
with
their
sacred
duties
there
are
among
them
only
two
who
are
merchants
and
men
of
property
and
these
are
styled
kafers
or
unbelievers
by
the
others
who
do
nothing
but
read
and
pray
jewish
devotees
from
all
parts
of
the
globe
flock
to
the
four
holy
cities
in
order
to
pass
their
days
in
praying
for
their
own
salvation
and
that
of
their
brethren
who
remain
occupied
in
worldly
pursuits
but
the
offering
up
of
prayers
by
these
devotees
is
rendered
still
more
indispensible
by
a
dogma
contained
in
the
talmud
that
the
world
will
return
to
its
primitive
chaos
if
prayers
are
not
addressed
to
the
god
of
israel
at
least
twice
a
week
in
these
four
cities
this
belief
produces
considerable
pecuniary
advantage
to
the
supplicants
as
the
missionaries
sent
abroad
to
collect
alms
for
the
support
of
these
religious
fraternities
plead
the
danger
of
the
threatened
chaos
to
induce
the
rich
jews
to
send
supplies
of
money
in
order
that
the
prayers
may
be
constantly
offered
up
three
or
four
missionaries
are
sent
out
every
year
one
to
the
coasts
of
africa
from
damietta
to
mogadore
another
to
the
coasts
of
europe
from
venice
to
gibraltar
a
third
to
the
archipelago
constantinople
and
anatolia
and
a
fourth
through
syria
the
charity
of
the
jews
of
london
is
appealed
to
from
time
to
time
but
the
jews
of
gibraltar
have
the
reputation
of
being
more
liberal
than
any
others
and
from
four
to
five
thousand
spanish
dollars
are
received
annually
from
them
the
polish
jews
settled
at
tabaria
send
several
collectors
regularly
into
bohemia
and
poland
and
the
rich
jewish
merchants
in
those
countries
have
their
pensioners
in
the
holy
land
to
whom
they
regularly
transmit
sums
of
money
great
jealousy
seems
to
prevail
between
the
syrian
and
polish
jews
the
former
being
in
possession
of
the
place
oblige
the
foreighers
to
pay
excessively
high
for
their
lodgings
and
compel
them
also
to
contribute
considerable
sums
towards
the
relief
of
the
indigent
syrians
while
they
themselves
never
give
the
smallest
trifle
to
the
poor
from
poland
the
pilgrim
jews
who
repair
to
tiberias
are
of
all
ages
from
twelve
to
sixty
if
they
bring
a
little
money
with
them
the
cunning
of
their
brethren
here
soon
deprives
them
of
it
for
as
they
arrive
with
the
most
extravagant
ideas
of
the
holy
cities
they
are
easily
imposed
upon
before
their
enthusiasm
begins
to
cool
to
rent
a
house
in
which
some
learned
rabbin
or
saint
died
to
visit
the
tombs
of
the
most
renowned
devotees
to
have
the
sacred
books
opened
in
their
presence
and
public
prayers
read
for
the
salvation
of
the
all
these
inestimable
advantages
together
with
various
other
minor
religious
tricks
soon
strip
the
stranger
of
his
last
farthing
he
then
becomes
dependent
upon
the
charity
of
his
nation
upon
foreign
subsidies
or
upon
the
fervour
of
some
inexperienced
pilgrim
those
who
go
abroad
as
missionaries
generally
realise
some
property
as
they
are
allowed
ten
per
cent
upon
all
alms
collected
besides
their
travelling
expenses
the
jewish
devotees
pass
the
whole
day
in
the
schools
or
the
synagogue
reciting
the
old
testament
and
the
talmud
both
of
which
many
of
them
know
entirely
by
heart
they
all
write
hebrew
but
i
did
not
see
any
fine
amongst
them
their
learning
seems
to
be
on
the
same
level
as
that
of
the
turks
among
whom
an
olema
thinks
he
has
attained
the
pinnacle
of
knowledge
if
he
can
recite
all
the
koran
together
with
some
thousand
of
hadeath
or
sentences
of
the
prophet
and
traditions
concerning
him
but
neither
jews
nor
turks
nor
christians
in
these
countries
have
the
slightest
idea
of
that
criticism
which
might
guide
them
to
a
rational
explanation
or
emendation
of
their
sacred
books
it
was
in
vain
that
i
put
questions
to
several
of
the
first
rabbins
concerning
the
desert
in
which
the
children
of
israel
sojourned
for
forty
years
i
found
that
my
own
scanty
knowledge
of
the
geography
of
palestine
and
of
its
partition
amongst
the
twelve
tribes
was
superior
to
theirs
there
are
some
beautiful
copies
of
the
books
of
moses
in
the
syrian
synagogue
written
upon
a
long
roll
of
leather
not
parchment
but
no
one
could
tell
me
when
or
where
they
were
made
i
suspect
however
that
they
came
from
bagdad
where
the
best
hebrew
scribes
live
and
of
whose
writings
i
had
seen
many
fine
specimens
at
aleppo
and
damascus
the
libraries
of
the
two
schools
at
tiberias
are
moderately
stocked
with
hebrew
books
most
of
which
have
been
printed
at
vienna
and
venice
except
some
copies
of
the
old
testament
and
the
talmud
they
have
no
manuscripts
they
observe
a
singular
custom
here
in
praying
while
the
rabbin
recites
the
psalms
of
david
or
the
prayers
extracted
from
them
the
congregation
frequently
imitate
by
their
voice
or
gestures
the
meaning
of
some
remarkable
passages
for
example
when
the
rabbin
pronounces
the
words
the
lord
with
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
they
imitate
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
through
their
closed
fists
when
horrible
occurs
they
puff
and
blow
to
represent
a
storm
or
should
he
mention
cries
of
the
righteous
in
distress
they
all
set
up
a
loud
screaming
and
it
not
unfrequently
happens
that
while
some
are
still
blowing
the
storm
others
have
already
begun
the
cries
of
the
righteous
thus
forming
a
concert
which
it
is
difficult
for
any
but
a
zealous
hebrew
to
hear
with
gravity
the
jews
enjoy
here
perfect
religious
freedom
more
particularly
since
soleiman
whose
principal
minister
haym
farkhy
is
a
jew
has
succeeded
to
the
pashalik
of
akka
during
the
life
of
djezzar
pasha
they
were
often
obliged
to
pay
heavy
fines
at
present
they
merely
pay
the
kharadj
their
conduct
however
is
not
so
prudent
as
it
ought
to
be
in
a
country
where
the
turks
are
always
watching
for
a
pretext
to
extort
money
they
sell
wine
and
brandy
to
the
soldiers
of
the
town
almost
publicly
and
at
their
weddings
they
make
a
very
dangerous
display
of
their
wealth
on
these
occasions
they
traverse
the
city
in
pompous
procession
carrying
before
the
bride
the
plate
of
almost
the
whole
community
consisting
of
large
dishes
coffee
pots
coffee
cups
and
they
feast
in
the
house
of
the
bridegroom
for
seven
successive
days
and
nights
the
wedding
feast
of
a
man
who
has
about
fifty
pounds
a
year
and
no
jew
can
live
with
his
family
on
less
will
often
cost
more
than
sixty
pounds
they
marry
at
a
very
early
age
it
being
not
uncommon
to
see
mothers
of
eleven
and
fathers
of
thirteen
years
the
rabbin
of
tiberias
is
under
the
great
rabbin
of
szaffad
who
pronounces
final
judgment
on
all
contested
points
of
law
and
religion
i
found
amongst
the
polish
jews
one
from
bohemia
an
honest
german
who
was
overjoyed
on
hearing
me
speak
his
own
language
and
who
carried
me
through
the
quarter
introducing
me
to
all
his
acquaintance
in
every
house
i
was
offered
brandy
and
the
women
appeared
to
be
much
less
shy
than
they
are
in
other
parts
of
syria
it
may
easily
be
supposed
that
many
of
these
jews
are
discontented
with
their
lot
led
by
the
stories
of
the
missionaries
to
conceive
the
most
exalted
ideas
of
the
land
of
promise
as
they
still
call
it
several
of
them
have
absconded
from
their
parents
to
beg
their
way
to
palestine
but
no
sooner
do
they
arrive
in
one
or
other
of
the
four
holy
cities
than
they
find
by
the
aspect
of
all
around
them
that
they
have
been
deceived
a
few
find
their
way
back
to
their
native
country
but
the
greater
number
remain
and
look
forward
to
the
inestimable
advantage
of
having
their
bones
laid
in
the
holy
land
the
cemetery
of
the
jews
of
tiberias
is
on
the
declivity
of
the
mountain
about
half
an
hour
from
the
town
where
the
tombs
of
their
most
renowed
persons
are
visited
much
in
the
same
manner
as
are
the
sepulchres
of
mussulman
saints
i
was
informed
that
a
great
rabbin
lay
buried
there
with
fourteen
thousand
of
his
scholars
around
him
the
ancient
town
of
tiberias
does
not
seem
to
have
occupied
any
part
of
the
present
limits
of
tabaria
but
was
probably
situated
at
a
short
distance
farther
to
the
south
near
the
borders
of
the
lake
its
ruins
begin
at
about
five
minutes
walk
from
the
wall
of
the
present
town
on
the
road
to
the
the
only
remains
of
antiquity
are
a
few
columns
heaps
of
stones
and
some
half
ruined
walls
and
foundations
of
houses
on
the
close
to
the
water
are
the
ruins
of
a
long
thick
wall
or
mole
with
a
few
columns
of
gray
granite
lying
in
the
sea
about
between
the
town
and
the
in
the
midst
of
the
plain
i
saw
seven
columns
of
which
two
only
are
standing
upright
and
there
may
probably
be
more
lying
on
the
ground
hid
among
the
high
grass
with
which
the
plain
is
covered
they
are
of
gray
granite
about
twelve
or
fourteen
feet
long
and
fifteen
inches
in
diameter
at
a
short
distance
from
them
is
the
fragment
of
a
beautiful
column
of
red
egyptian
granite
of
more
than
two
feet
in
diameter
these
ruins
stretch
along
the
as
far
as
the
hot
springs
and
extend
to
about
three
hundred
yards
inland
the
springs
are
at
minutes
from
the
modern
town
and
twenty
paces
from
the
edge
they
were
probably
very
near
the
gate
of
the
ancient
town
no
vestiges
of
buildings
of
any
size
are
visible
here
nothing
being
seen
but
the
ruins
of
small
arched
buildings
and
heaps
of
stone
there
are
some
other
remains
of
ancient
habitations
on
the
north
side
of
the
town
upon
a
hill
close
to
the
sea
which
is
connected
with
the
mountain
here
are
also
some
thick
walls
which
indicate
that
this
point
which
commands
the
town
was
anciently
fortified
none
of
the
ruined
buildings
in
tiberias
or
the
neighbourhood
are
constructed
with
large
stones
denoting
a
remote
age
all
the
walls
of
which
any
fragments
yet
remain
being
of
small
black
stones
cemented
together
by
a
very
thick
cement
upon
a
low
hill
on
the
side
of
the
town
stands
a
well
built
mosque
and
the
chapel
of
a
female
saint
the
present
is
built
over
the
spring
nearest
the
town
and
consists
of
two
double
rooms
the
apartment
being
separated
from
that
of
the
women
the
former
is
a
square
vaulted
chamber
with
a
large
stone
basin
in
the
centre
surrounded
by
broad
stone
benches
the
spring
issues
from
the
wall
and
flows
into
the
basin
or
bath
after
remaining
in
the
water
for
about
ten
minutes
the
bathers
seat
themselves
naked
upon
the
stone
benches
where
they
remain
for
an
hour
with
this
chamber
a
coffee
room
cummunicates
in
which
a
waiter
lives
during
the
bathing
season
and
where
visitors
from
a
distance
may
lodge
the
spring
which
has
thus
been
appropriated
to
bathing
is
the
largest
of
four
hot
sources
the
volume
of
its
water
is
very
considerable
and
would
be
sufficient
to
turn
a
mill
continuing
along
the
shore
for
about
two
hundred
paces
the
three
other
are
met
with
or
four
if
we
count
separately
two
small
ones
close
together
the
most
southern
spring
seems
to
be
the
hottest
of
all
the
hand
can
not
be
held
in
it
the
water
deposits
upon
the
stones
over
which
it
flows
in
its
way
towards
the
sea
a
thick
crust
but
the
colour
of
the
deposit
is
not
the
same
from
all
the
springs
in
some
it
is
white
in
the
others
it
is
of
a
red
yellowish
hue
a
circumstance
which
seems
to
indicate
that
the
nature
of
the
water
is
not
the
same
in
all
the
sources
there
are
no
remains
whatever
of
ancient
buildings
near
the
hottest
spring
people
from
all
parts
of
syria
resort
to
these
baths
which
are
reckoned
most
efficacious
in
july
they
are
recommended
principally
for
rheumatic
complaints
and
cases
of
premature
debility
two
patients
only
were
present
when
i
visited
them
some
public
women
of
damascus
who
were
kept
by
the
garrison
of
tabaria
had
established
themselves
in
the
ruined
vaults
and
caverns
near
the
baths
in
the
fourteenth
century
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
arabian
geographers
the
tomb
of
lokman
the
philosopher
was
shewn
at
tiberias
not
having
been
immediately
able
to
find
a
guide
to
accompany
me
along
the
valley
of
the
jordan
i
visited
a
fortress
in
the
mountain
near
medjdel
see
page
of
which
i
had
heard
much
at
tabaria
it
is
called
kalaat
ibn
maan
arabic
the
castle
of
the
son
of
maan
or
kalaat
hamam
arabic
the
castle
on
account
of
the
vast
quantity
of
wild
pigeons
that
breed
there
it
is
situated
half
kalaat
hamam
an
hour
to
the
west
of
medjdel
on
the
cliff
which
borders
the
wady
hamam
in
the
calcareous
mountain
are
many
natural
caverns
which
have
been
united
together
by
passages
cut
in
the
rock
and
enlarged
in
order
to
render
them
more
commodious
for
habitation
walls
have
also
been
built
across
the
natural
openings
so
that
no
person
could
enter
them
except
through
the
narrow
communicating
passages
and
wherever
the
nature
of
the
almost
perpendicular
cliff
permitted
it
small
bastions
were
built
to
defend
the
entrance
of
the
castle
which
has
been
thus
rendered
almost
impregnable
the
perpendicular
cliff
forms
its
protection
above
and
the
access
from
below
is
by
a
narrow
path
so
steep
as
not
to
allow
of
a
horse
mounting
it
in
the
midst
of
the
caverns
several
deep
cisterns
have
been
hewn
the
whole
might
afford
refuge
to
about
six
hundred
men
but
the
walls
are
now
much
damaged
the
place
was
probably
the
work
of
some
powerful
robber
about
the
time
of
the
crusades
a
few
vaults
of
communication
with
pointed
arches
denote
gothic
architecture
below
in
the
valley
runs
a
small
rivulet
which
empties
itself
into
the
wady
lymoun
here
the
peasants
of
medjdel
cultivate
some
gardens
in
returning
from
the
kalaat
hamam
i
was
several
times
reprimanded
by
my
guide
for
not
taking
proper
care
of
the
lighted
tobacco
that
fell
from
my
pipe
the
whole
of
the
mountain
is
thickly
covered
with
dry
grass
which
readily
takes
fire
and
the
slightest
breath
of
air
instantly
spreads
the
conflagration
far
over
the
country
to
the
great
risk
of
the
harvest
the
arabs
who
inhabit
the
valley
of
the
jordan
invariably
put
to
death
any
person
who
is
known
to
have
been
even
the
innocent
cause
of
firing
the
grass
and
they
have
made
it
a
public
law
among
themselves
that
even
in
the
height
of
intestine
warfare
no
one
shall
attempt
to
set
his
harvest
on
fire
one
evening
while
at
tabaria
i
saw
a
large
fire
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
which
lake
of
tiberias
spread
with
great
velocity
for
two
days
till
its
progress
was
checked
by
the
wady
feik
the
water
of
the
lake
of
tiberias
along
its
shores
from
medjdel
to
the
is
of
considerable
depth
with
no
shallows
i
was
told
that
the
water
rises
during
the
rainy
season
three
or
four
feet
above
its
ordinary
level
which
seems
not
at
all
improbable
considering
the
great
number
of
winter
torrents
which
empty
themselves
into
the
lake
the
northern
part
is
full
of
fish
but
i
did
not
see
a
single
one
at
szammagh
at
the
southern
extremity
see
the
most
common
species
are
the
binni
or
carp
and
the
mesht
arabic
which
is
about
a
foot
long
and
five
inches
broad
with
a
flat
body
like
the
sole
the
fishery
of
the
lake
is
rented
at
seven
hundred
piastres
per
annum
but
the
only
boat
that
was
employed
on
it
by
the
fishermen
fell
to
pieces
last
year
and
such
is
the
indolence
of
these
people
that
they
have
not
yet
supplied
its
loss
the
lake
furnishes
the
inhabitants
of
tiberias
with
water
there
being
no
spring
of
sweet
water
near
the
town
several
houses
have
salt
wells
june
took
a
guide
to
mount
tabor
the
whole
of
this
country
even
to
the
gates
of
damascus
is
in
a
state
of
insecurity
which
renders
it
very
imprudent
to
travel
alone
merchants
go
only
in
large
caravans
we
ascended
the
mountain
to
the
west
of
the
town
and
in
minutes
passed
the
ruined
vil
lage
of
szermedein
arabic
on
the
declivity
of
the
mountain
where
is
a
fine
spring
and
the
tomb
of
a
celebrated
saint
the
people
of
tabaria
here
cultivate
dhourra
melons
and
tobacco
at
the
end
of
one
hour
we
reached
the
top
of
the
steep
mountain
from
whence
mount
tabor
or
djebel
tor
arabic
as
the
natives
call
it
bears
by
from
hence
the
road
continues
on
a
gentle
mount
tabor
declivity
in
the
midst
of
well
cultivated
dhourra
fields
as
far
as
a
low
tract
called
ardh
el
hamma
arabic
the
whole
district
is
covered
with
the
thorny
shrub
merar
arabic
on
the
west
side
of
ardh
el
hamma
we
again
ascended
and
reached
the
village
of
kefer
sebt
arabic
distant
two
hours
and
a
half
from
tabaria
and
situated
on
the
top
of
a
range
of
hills
which
run
parallel
to
those
of
tabaria
about
half
an
hour
to
the
is
the
spring
ain
dhamy
arabic
in
a
deep
valley
from
hence
a
wide
plain
extends
to
the
foot
of
djebel
tor
in
crossing
it
we
saw
on
our
right
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
from
the
road
the
village
louby
arabic
and
a
little
farther
on
the
village
shedjare
arabic
the
plain
was
covered
with
the
wild
artichoke
called
khob
arabic
it
bears
a
thorny
violet
coloured
flower
in
the
shape
of
an
artichoke
upon
a
stem
five
feet
in
height
in
three
hours
and
a
quarter
we
arrived
at
the
khan
of
djebel
tor
arabic
a
large
ruinous
building
inhabited
by
a
few
families
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
is
a
half
ruined
fort
a
large
fair
is
held
here
every
monday
though
the
khan
is
at
no
great
distance
from
the
foot
of
mount
tabor
the
people
could
not
inform
us
whether
or
not
the
mount
was
inhabited
at
present
nor
were
they
hospitable
enough
either
to
lend
or
sell
us
the
little
provision
we
might
want
should
there
be
no
inhabitants
at
a
quarter
of
an
hour
from
the
khan
is
a
fine
spring
where
we
found
an
encampment
of
bedouins
of
the
tribe
of
szefeyh
arabic
whose
principal
riches
consist
in
cows
my
guide
went
astray
in
the
valleys
which
surround
the
lower
parts
of
djebel
tor
and
we
were
nearly
three
hours
from
our
departure
from
the
khan
in
reaching
the
top
of
the
mount
mount
tabor
is
almost
insulated
and
overtops
all
the
neighbouring
summits
on
its
south
and
west
sides
extends
a
large
plain
known
by
the
name
of
merdj
ibn
aamer
arabic
the
plain
of
esdrelon
of
the
scriptures
to
the
of
the
plain
are
the
mountains
of
nablous
and
to
the
of
it
those
of
nazareth
which
reach
to
the
foot
of
mount
tabor
terminating
at
the
village
of
daboury
the
plain
of
esdrelon
is
about
eight
hours
in
length
and
four
in
breadth
it
is
very
fertile
but
at
present
almost
entirely
deserted
the
shape
of
mount
tabor
is
that
of
a
truncated
cone
its
sides
are
covered
to
the
top
with
a
forest
of
oak
and
wild
pistachio
trees
its
top
is
about
half
an
hour
in
circuit
the
mountain
is
entirely
calcareous
we
found
on
the
top
a
single
family
of
greek
christians
refugees
from
ezra
a
village
in
the
haouran
where
i
had
known
them
during
my
stay
there
in
november
they
had
retired
to
this
remote
spot
to
avoid
paying
taxes
to
the
government
and
expected
to
remain
unnoticed
they
rented
the
upper
plain
at
the
rate
of
fifty
piastres
per
annum
from
the
sheikh
of
daboury
to
which
village
the
mountain
belongs
the
harvest
which
they
were
now
gathering
in
was
worth
about
twelve
hundred
piastres
and
they
had
had
the
good
fortune
not
to
be
disturbed
by
any
which
will
certainly
not
be
the
case
next
year
should
they
remain
here
on
the
top
of
mount
tabor
are
found
the
remains
of
a
large
fortress
a
thick
wall
constructed
with
large
stones
may
be
traced
quite
round
the
summit
close
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
on
several
parts
of
it
are
the
remains
of
bastions
on
the
west
side
a
high
arched
gate
called
bab
el
haoua
arabic
or
the
gate
of
the
winds
is
shewn
which
appears
to
have
been
the
principal
entrance
the
area
is
overspread
with
the
ruins
of
private
dwellings
built
of
stone
with
great
solidity
there
are
no
springs
but
a
great
number
of
reservoirs
have
been
cut
in
the
rock
two
of
which
are
still
of
service
in
supplying
water
the
christians
consider
mount
tabor
a
holy
place
in
honour
of
the
transfiguration
but
the
exact
spot
at
which
it
took
place
is
not
known
and
the
latins
and
greeks
are
at
variance
upon
the
subject
the
latins
celebrate
the
sacred
event
in
a
small
cavern
where
they
have
formed
a
chapel
at
about
five
minutes
walk
from
which
the
greeks
have
built
a
low
circular
wall
with
an
altar
before
it
for
the
same
purpose
the
latin
missionaries
of
the
frank
convent
of
nazareth
send
annually
two
fathers
to
celebrate
a
mass
in
their
chapel
they
generally
choose
day
for
making
this
visit
and
arrive
here
in
the
morning
in
order
that
they
may
read
the
evening
mass
in
the
church
of
peter
at
tabaria
the
greek
priests
of
nazareth
visit
their
chapel
of
mount
tabor
on
the
festival
of
the
virgin
on
which
occasion
several
thousand
pilgrims
repair
to
the
mountain
where
they
pass
the
night
under
tents
with
their
families
in
mirth
and
feasting
during
the
greater
part
of
the
summer
mount
tabor
is
covered
in
the
morning
with
thick
clouds
which
disperse
towards
a
strong
wind
blows
the
whole
of
the
day
and
in
the
night
dews
fall
more
copious
than
any
i
had
seen
in
syria
in
the
wooded
parts
of
the
mountain
are
wild
boars
and
ounces
i
lodged
with
my
old
acquaintance
the
arab
of
ezra
who
had
taken
up
his
quarters
in
one
of
the
ruined
habitations
june
we
returned
to
tabaria
by
the
same
road
on
entering
the
of
my
old
lodgings
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
find
it
full
of
strangers
bruce
an
english
traveller
had
arrived
from
nazareth
in
company
with
several
priests
of
the
frank
convent
who
intended
to
celebrate
mass
at
night
this
being
day
i
was
easily
prevailed
on
by
bruce
to
accompany
him
on
his
return
to
nazareth
the
following
morning
the
more
so
as
i
there
hoped
to
find
a
guide
for
the
valley
of
the
jordan
for
no
person
at
tabaria
nazareth
seemed
to
be
inclined
to
undertake
the
journey
except
in
the
company
of
an
armed
caravan
june
left
tabaria
two
hours
before
there
are
two
direct
roads
to
nazareth
one
by
kefer
sebt
and
el
khan
the
other
by
louby
we
took
a
third
that
we
might
visit
some
spots
recorded
in
the
new
testament
in
one
hour
from
tabaria
we
passed
a
spring
called
ain
el
rahham
arabic
at
two
hours
and
a
half
the
road
leads
over
a
high
uncultivated
plain
to
hedjar
el
noszara
arabic
the
stones
of
the
christians
four
or
five
blocks
of
black
stone
upon
which
christ
is
said
to
have
reclined
while
addressing
the
people
who
flocked
around
him
the
priests
of
nazareth
stopped
to
read
some
prayers
over
the
stones
below
this
place
towards
the
extends
a
small
plain
called
sahel
hottein
arabic
the
country
is
intersected
by
wadys
about
one
hour
distant
from
the
stones
upon
the
same
level
stands
a
hill
of
an
oblong
shape
with
two
projecting
summits
on
one
of
its
extremities
the
natives
call
it
keroun
hottein
arabic
the
horns
of
hottein
the
christians
have
given
it
the
appellation
of
mons
beatitudinis
and
pretend
that
the
five
thousand
were
there
fed
we
travelled
over
an
uneven
uncultivated
ground
until
we
arrived
at
kefer
kenna
arabic
four
hours
and
a
quarter
from
tabaria
a
neat
village
with
a
copious
spring
surrounded
by
plantations
of
olive
and
other
fruit
trees
and
chiefly
inhabited
by
catholic
christians
this
is
the
cana
celebrated
in
the
new
testament
for
the
miracle
at
the
marriage
feast
and
the
house
is
shewn
in
which
our
saviour
performed
it
we
rested
under
an
immense
which
afforded
shelter
from
the
sun
to
a
dozen
men
and
as
many
horses
and
mules
from
hence
the
road
ascends
and
continues
across
chalky
hills
overgrown
with
low
shrubs
as
far
as
naszera
arabic
or
nazareth
eight
hours
from
tabaria
by
the
road
we
travelled
i
alighted
at
the
convent
belonging
to
the
missionaries
of
terra
santa
here
bruce
introduced
me
to
lady
hester
stanhope
who
had
arrived
a
few
days
before
from
jerusalem
and
akka
and
was
preparing
to
visit
the
northern
parts
of
syria
and
among
other
places
palmyra
the
manly
spirit
and
enlightened
curiosity
of
this
lady
ought
to
make
many
modern
travellers
ashamed
of
the
indolent
indifference
with
which
they
hurry
over
foreign
countries
she
sees
a
great
deal
and
carefully
examines
what
she
sees
but
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
polite
and
distinguished
manner
in
which
she
is
every
where
received
by
the
governors
of
the
country
will
not
impress
her
with
too
favourable
an
opinion
of
the
turks
in
general
and
of
their
disposition
towards
the
nations
of
europe
naszera
is
one
of
the
principal
towns
of
the
pashalik
of
akka
its
inhabitants
are
industrious
because
they
are
treated
with
less
severity
than
those
of
the
country
towns
in
general
of
them
are
turks
and
christians
there
are
about
ninety
latin
families
together
with
a
congregation
of
greek
catholics
and
another
of
maronites
the
house
of
joseph
is
shewn
to
pilgrims
and
travellers
but
the
principal
curiosity
of
nazareth
is
the
convent
of
the
latin
friars
a
very
spacious
and
commodious
building
which
was
thoroughly
repaired
and
considerably
enlarged
in
within
it
is
the
church
of
the
annunciation
in
which
the
spot
is
shewn
where
the
angel
stood
when
he
announced
to
the
virgin
mary
the
tidings
of
the
messiah
behind
the
altar
is
a
subterraneous
cavern
divided
into
small
grottos
where
the
virgin
is
said
to
have
lived
her
kitchen
parlour
and
bedroom
are
shewn
and
a
narrow
hole
in
the
rock
in
which
the
child
jesus
once
hid
himself
from
his
persecutors
for
the
syrian
christians
have
a
plentiful
stock
of
such
traditions
unfounded
upon
any
authority
of
scripture
the
pilgrims
who
visit
these
holy
spots
are
in
the
habit
of
knocking
off
small
pieces
of
stone
from
the
walls
of
the
grottos
which
are
thus
continually
enlarging
in
the
church
a
miracle
is
still
exhibited
to
the
faithful
a
fine
granite
column
the
base
and
upper
part
of
which
remain
has
lost
the
middle
part
of
its
shaft
according
to
the
tradition
it
was
destroyed
by
the
saracens
ever
since
which
time
the
upper
part
has
been
miraculously
suspended
from
the
roof
as
if
attracted
by
a
all
the
christians
of
nazareth
with
the
friars
of
course
at
their
head
affect
to
believe
in
this
miracle
although
it
is
perfectly
evident
that
the
upper
part
of
the
column
is
connected
with
the
roof
the
church
is
the
finest
in
syria
next
to
that
of
the
holy
sepulchre
at
jerusalem
and
contains
two
tolerably
good
organs
within
the
walls
of
the
convent
are
two
gardens
and
a
small
burying
ground
the
walls
are
very
thick
and
serve
occasionally
as
a
fortress
to
all
the
christians
of
the
town
there
are
at
present
eleven
friars
in
the
convent
the
yearly
expenses
of
the
establishment
amount
to
upwards
of
sterling
a
small
part
of
which
is
defrayed
by
the
rent
of
a
few
houses
in
the
town
and
by
the
produce
of
some
acres
of
corn
land
the
rest
is
remitted
from
jerusalem
the
whole
annual
expenses
of
the
terra
santa
convents
are
about
they
have
felt
very
sensibly
the
occupation
of
spain
by
the
french
and
little
has
been
received
from
europe
for
the
last
four
years
while
the
turkish
authorities
exact
the
same
yearly
tribute
and
extraordinary
contributions
as
formerly
the
terra
santa
pays
to
the
pasha
of
damascus
about
a
year
the
greek
convent
of
jerusalem
pays
much
more
as
well
to
maintain
its
own
privileges
as
with
a
view
to
encroach
upon
those
of
the
latins
so
that
if
spain
be
not
speedily
liberated
it
is
to
be
feared
that
the
whole
establishment
of
the
terra
santa
must
be
abandoned
this
would
be
a
great
calamity
for
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
they
have
done
honour
to
the
european
name
in
the
levant
and
have
been
very
beneficial
to
the
cause
of
christianity
under
the
actual
circumstances
of
the
east
the
friars
are
chiefly
spanjards
they
are
exasperated
against
france
for
pretending
to
protect
them
without
affording
them
the
smallest
relief
from
the
oppressions
i
understood
from
the
spanish
consul
at
cairo
that
when
the
news
of
the
capture
of
madrid
in
august
reached
jerusalem
the
spanish
priests
celebrated
a
public
te
deum
and
took
the
oaths
prescribed
by
the
new
constitution
of
the
cortes
but
they
are
obliged
to
accept
this
protection
as
the
spanish
ambassador
at
constantinople
is
not
yet
acknowledged
by
the
porte
they
are
well
worth
the
attention
of
any
ambassador
at
the
porte
whose
government
is
desirous
of
maintaining
an
influence
in
syria
for
they
command
the
consciences
of
upwards
of
eighty
thousand
souls
when
the
french
invaded
syria
nazareth
was
occupied
by
six
or
eight
hundred
men
whose
advanced
posts
were
at
tabaria
and
szaffad
two
hours
from
hence
general
kleber
sustained
with
a
corps
not
exceeding
fifteen
hundred
men
the
attack
of
the
whole
syrian
army
amounting
to
at
least
thousand
he
was
posted
in
the
plain
of
esdrelon
near
the
village
of
foule
where
he
formed
his
battalion
into
a
square
which
continued
fighting
from
to
until
they
had
expended
almost
all
their
ammunition
bonaparte
informed
of
perilous
situation
advanced
to
his
support
with
six
hundred
men
no
sooner
had
he
come
in
sight
of
the
enemy
and
fired
a
shot
over
the
plain
than
the
turks
supposing
that
a
large
force
was
advancing
took
precipitately
to
flight
during
which
several
thousands
were
killed
and
many
drowned
in
the
river
daboury
which
then
inundated
a
part
of
the
plain
bonaparte
dined
at
nazareth
the
most
northern
point
that
he
reached
in
syria
and
returned
the
same
day
to
akka
after
the
retreat
of
the
french
from
akka
djezzar
pasha
resolved
on
causing
all
the
christians
in
his
pashalik
to
be
massacred
and
had
already
sent
orders
to
that
effect
to
jerusalem
and
nazareth
but
sir
sidney
smith
being
apprized
of
his
intentions
reproached
him
for
his
cruelty
in
the
severest
terms
and
threatened
that
if
a
single
christian
head
should
fall
he
would
bombard
akka
and
set
it
on
fire
djezzar
was
thus
obliged
to
send
counter
orders
but
sir
interference
is
still
remembered
with
heartfelt
gratitude
by
all
the
christians
who
look
upon
him
as
their
deliverer
word
i
have
often
heard
both
turks
and
christians
exclaim
like
word
it
never
the
same
can
not
be
said
of
his
antagonist
at
akka
who
maliciously
impressed
the
christians
certainly
much
inclined
in
his
favour
with
the
idea
of
his
speedy
return
from
egypt
on
retreating
from
akka
he
sent
word
to
his
partizans
at
szaffad
and
nazareth
exhorting
them
to
bear
up
resolutely
against
the
turks
but
for
three
months
when
he
assured
them
upon
his
honour
and
with
many
oaths
that
he
would
return
with
a
much
stronger
force
and
deliver
them
from
their
oppressors
the
inhabitants
of
nazareth
differ
somewhat
in
features
and
colour
from
the
northern
syrians
their
physiognomy
approaches
that
of
the
egyptians
while
their
dialect
and
pronunciation
differ
widely
from
those
of
damascus
in
western
palestine
especially
on
the
coast
the
inhabitants
seem
in
general
to
bear
more
resemblance
to
the
natives
of
egypt
than
to
those
of
northern
syria
towards
the
east
of
palestine
on
the
contrary
especially
in
the
villages
about
nablous
jerusalem
and
hebron
they
are
evidently
of
the
true
syrian
stock
in
features
though
not
in
language
it
would
be
an
interesting
subject
for
an
artist
to
pourtray
accurately
the
different
character
of
features
of
the
syrian
nations
the
aleppine
the
turkman
the
native
of
mount
libanus
the
damascene
the
inhabitant
of
the
from
beirout
to
akka
and
the
bedouin
although
all
inhabiting
the
same
country
have
distict
national
physiognomies
and
a
slight
acquaintance
with
them
enables
one
to
determine
the
native
district
of
a
syrian
with
almost
as
much
certainty
as
an
englishman
may
be
distinguished
at
first
sight
from
an
italian
or
an
inhabitant
of
the
south
of
france
the
christians
of
nazareth
enjoy
great
liberty
the
fathers
go
a
shooting
alone
in
their
monastic
habits
to
several
hours
distance
from
the
convent
without
ever
being
insulted
by
the
turks
i
was
told
that
about
thirty
years
ago
the
padre
guardiano
of
the
convent
was
also
sheikh
or
chief
justice
of
the
town
an
office
for
which
he
paid
a
certain
yearly
sum
to
the
pasha
of
akka
the
police
of
the
place
was
consequently
in
his
hands
and
when
any
disturbance
happened
the
reverend
father
used
to
take
his
stick
repair
to
the
spot
and
lay
about
him
freely
no
matter
whether
upon
turks
or
christians
the
guardian
has
still
much
influence
in
the
town
because
he
is
supposed
as
usual
to
be
on
good
terms
with
the
pasha
but
at
present
the
chief
man
at
nazareth
is
catafago
a
merchant
of
frank
origin
born
at
aleppo
he
has
rented
from
the
pasha
about
twelve
villages
situated
in
the
neighbourhood
of
nazareth
and
the
plain
of
esdrelon
for
which
he
pays
yearly
upwards
of
the
villages
in
the
pashalik
of
akka
are
all
of
the
description
which
the
turkish
law
calls
melk
they
are
all
assessed
at
certain
yearly
sums
which
each
is
obliged
to
pay
whatever
may
be
the
number
of
its
inhabitants
this
is
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
the
depopulation
of
many
parts
of
syria
his
profits
are
very
considerable
and
as
he
meddles
much
in
the
politics
and
intrigues
of
the
country
he
has
become
a
person
of
great
consequence
his
influence
and
recommendations
may
prove
very
useful
to
travellers
in
palestine
especially
to
those
who
visit
the
dangerous
districts
of
nablous
nablous
it
happened
luckily
during
my
stay
at
nazareth
that
two
petty
merchants
arrived
there
from
szalt
to
take
up
some
merchandize
which
they
sell
at
szalt
on
account
of
their
principals
at
this
place
szalt
was
precisely
the
point
i
wished
to
reach
not
having
been
able
to
visit
it
during
my
late
tour
in
the
mountains
of
moerad
on
their
return
therefore
i
gladly
joined
their
little
carayan
and
we
left
nazareth
at
midnight
on
the
of
july
july
road
lay
over
a
mountainous
country
in
two
hours
from
nazareth
we
passed
a
small
rivulet
two
hours
and
a
half
the
village
denouny
arabic
and
near
it
the
ruins
of
endor
where
the
grotto
is
shewn
from
hence
the
direction
of
our
route
was
leaving
mount
tabor
to
the
left
we
passed
along
the
plain
of
esdrelon
meeting
with
several
springs
in
our
road
but
the
country
is
a
complete
desert
although
the
soil
is
fertile
at
five
hours
and
a
half
is
the
village
of
om
el
taybe
arabic
belonging
to
the
district
of
djebel
nablous
or
as
it
is
also
called
belad
harthe
arabic
the
inhabitants
of
nablous
are
governed
by
their
own
chiefs
who
are
invested
by
the
pasha
it
is
said
that
the
villages
belonging
to
the
district
can
raise
an
army
of
five
thousand
men
they
are
a
restless
people
continually
in
dispute
with
each
other
and
frequently
in
insurrection
against
the
pasha
djezzar
never
succeeded
in
completely
subduing
them
and
junot
with
a
corps
of
fifteen
hundred
french
soldiers
was
defeated
by
them
the
principal
chief
of
nablous
at
present
is
of
the
family
of
shadely
arabic
in
six
hours
and
three
quarters
we
passed
the
village
of
meraszrasz
arabic
upon
the
summit
of
a
chain
of
hills
on
the
side
of
wady
oeshe
arabic
which
falls
into
the
jordan
at
about
half
an
hour
to
the
north
of
this
wady
runs
another
called
wady
byre
arabic
likewise
falling
into
that
river
between
these
two
valleys
are
situated
the
villages
of
denna
arabic
and
kokab
arabic
beyond
meraszrasz
bysan
we
began
to
descend
and
reached
the
bottom
of
the
valley
el
ghor
in
seven
hours
and
three
quarters
from
our
departure
from
nazareth
we
now
turned
more
southward
and
followed
the
valley
as
far
as
bysan
distant
eight
hours
and
a
quarter
from
nazareth
the
two
merchants
and
myself
had
left
the
caravan
at
meraszrasz
and
proceeded
to
bysan
there
to
repose
till
the
camels
came
up
but
the
drivers
missed
the
road
and
we
continued
almost
the
whole
day
in
search
of
them
bysan
bethsan
scythopolis
is
situated
upon
rising
ground
on
the
west
side
of
the
ghor
where
the
chain
of
mountains
bordering
the
valley
declins
considerably
in
height
and
presents
merely
elevated
ground
quite
open
towards
the
west
at
one
hour
distant
to
the
south
the
mountains
begin
again
the
ancient
town
was
watered
by
a
river
now
called
moiet
bysan
arabic
or
the
water
of
bysan
which
flows
in
different
branches
towards
the
plain
the
ruins
of
scythopolis
are
of
considerable
extent
and
the
town
built
along
the
banks
of
the
rivulet
and
in
the
valleys
formed
by
its
several
branches
must
have
been
nearly
three
miles
in
circuit
the
only
remains
are
large
heaps
of
black
hewn
stones
many
foundations
of
houses
and
the
fragments
of
a
few
columns
i
saw
only
a
single
shaft
of
a
column
standing
in
one
of
the
valleys
is
a
large
mound
of
earth
which
appeared
to
me
to
be
artificial
it
was
the
site
perhaps
of
a
castle
for
the
defence
of
the
town
on
the
left
bank
of
the
stream
is
a
large
khan
where
the
caravans
repose
which
take
the
shortest
road
from
jerusalem
to
damascus
the
present
village
of
bysan
contains
seventy
or
eighty
houses
its
inhabitants
are
in
a
miserable
condition
from
being
exposed
to
the
depredations
of
the
bedouins
of
the
ghor
to
whom
they
also
pay
a
heavy
tribute
after
waiting
here
some
time
for
the
arrival
of
the
caravan
we
rode
across
the
valley
till
we
reached
the
valley
of
the
jordan
banks
of
the
jordan
about
two
hours
distant
from
bysan
which
bore
from
us
we
here
crossed
the
river
at
a
ford
where
our
companions
arrived
soon
afterwards
the
valley
of
the
jordan
or
el
ghor
arabic
which
may
be
said
to
begin
at
the
northern
extremity
of
the
lake
of
tiberias
has
near
bysan
a
direction
of
by
and
by
its
breadth
is
about
two
hours
the
great
number
of
rivulets
which
descend
from
the
mountains
on
both
sides
and
form
numerous
pools
of
stagnant
water
produce
in
many
places
a
pleasing
verdure
and
a
luxuriant
growth
of
wild
herbage
and
grass
but
the
greater
part
of
the
ground
is
a
parched
desert
of
which
a
few
spots
only
are
cultivated
by
the
bedouins
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bysan
the
soil
is
entirely
of
marle
there
are
very
few

wherever
there
is
water
high

are
found
the
river

on
issuing
from
the

flows
for
about
three
hours
near
the
western
hills
and
then
turns
towards
the
eastern
on
which
side
it
continues
its
course
for
several
hours
the
river
flows
in
a
valley
of
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
breadth
which
is
considerably
lower
than
the
rest
of
the
plain
of

this
lower
valley
is
covered
with
high
trees
and
a
luxuriant
verdure
which
affords
a
striking
contrast
with
the
sandy
slopes
that

the

in
that
direction
being
full
of
rocks
and
little
susceptible
of
the
river
where
we
passed
it
was
about
eighty
paces
broad
and
about
three
feet
deep
this
it
must
be
recollected
was
in
the
midst
of
summer
in
the
winter
it
inundates
the
plain
in
the
bottom
of
the
narrow
valley
but
never
rises
to
the
level
of
the
upper
plain
of
the
ghor
which
is
at
least
forty
feet
above
the
level
of

the

is
fordable
in
many
places
during
summer
but
the
few
spots
where
it
may
be
crossed
in
the
rainy
season
are
known
only
to
the
arabs
after
passing
the
river
we
continued
our
route
close
to
the
foot
of
the
eastern
mountain
in
half
an
hour
from
the
ford
we
crossed
wady
mous
arabic
coming
from
the
mountains
of
adjeloun
in
one
hour
and
a
quarter
we
passed
wady
yabes
and
near
it
the
mezar
or
tomb
called
sherhabeib
arabic
in
two
hours
we
came
to
a
stony
and
hilly
district
intersected
by
several
deep
but
dry
wadys
called
korn

arabic
the

our
direction
was
alternately
and
by
here
the

returns
to
the
western
side
of
the

the
korn
el
hemar
abou
obeida
projects
into
the
ghor
about
four
miles
so
that
when
seen
from
the
north
the
valley
seems
to
be
completely
shut
up
by
these
hills
from
thence
a
fertile
tract
commences
overgrown
with
many
bouttom
arabic
or
wild
pistachio
trees
large
tracts
of
ground
were
burnt
owing
probably
to
the
negligence
of
travellers
who
had
set
the
dry
grass
on
fire
at
the
end
of
six
hours
and
late
at
night
we
passed
to
the
right
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
city
standing
on
the
declivity
of
the
mountain
and
still
bearing
its
original
name
amata
arabic
my
companions
told
me
that
several
columns
remain
standing
and
also
some
large
buildings
a
small
rivulet
here
descends
into
the
plain
in
six
hours
and
a
half
we
reached
the
mezar
abou
obeida

where
we
rested
for
two
hours
the
tomb
of
the
sheikh
is
surrounded
by
a
few
houses
but
there
are
no
inhabitants
at
present
except
the
keeper
of
the
tomb
and
his
wife
who
live
upon
the
charity
of
the
bedouins
it
appears
from
the
account
given
by
the
great
barbary
traveller
ibn
batouta
that
in
the
sixteenth
century
this
part
of
the
ghor
was
well
cultivated
and
full
of
villages
the
valley
of
the
jordan
affords
pasturage
to
numerous
tribes
of
bedouins
some
of
them
remain
here
the
whole
year
considering
it
as
their
patrimony
others
visit
it
only
in
winter
of
the
latter
description
are
the
bedouins
who
belong
to
the
districts
of
naszera
and
nablous
as
well
as
those
of
the
eastern
mountains
we
met
with
several
encampments
of
stationary
bedouins
who
cultivate
a
few
fields
of
wheat
barley
and
dhourra
they
are
at
peace
with
the
people
of
szalt
to
many
of
whom
the
greater
part
of
them
are
personally
known
we
therefore
passed
unmolested
but
a
stranger
who
should
venture
to
travel
here
unaccompanied
by
a
guide
of
the
country
would
most
certainly
be
stripped
for
the
names
of
the
bedouin
tribes

elmeysera
july
departed
from
abou
obeida
long
before
proceeding
from
thence
in
a
more
western
direction
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
passed
the
northern
branch
of
the
river
el
zerka
near
a
mill
which
was
at
work
in
one
hour
we
passed
the
principal
stream
a
small
river
which
empties
itself
into
the
jordan
about
one
hour
and
a
half
to
the
of
the
spot
where
it
issues
from
the
mountain
its
banks
are
overgrown
with
defle
solanum
furiosum
on
the
other
side
of
the
zerka
we
ascended
the
mountain
by
a
steep
acclivity
but
the
road
from
being
much
frequented
is
tolerably
good
the
mountain
consists
of
calcareous
rock
with
layers
of
various
coloured
and
large
blocks
of
the
black
haouran
stone
or
basalt
which
forms
a
principal
feature
in
the
mineralogy
of
eastern
syria
in
two
hours
and
three
quarters
we
arrived
at
the
top
of
the
mountain
from
whence
abou
obeida
bore
here
we
had
a
fine
view
over
the
valley
below
on
the
west
side
of
the
jordan
between
the
river
and
the
mountains
of
nablous
i
remarked
a
chain
of
low
calcareous
rocky
heights
which
begin
at
about
three
hours
north
of
abou
obeida
and
continue
for
several
hours
distance
to
the
of
that
place
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
the
highest
point
of
djebel
nablous
bore
the
direction
of
nablous
itself
was
pointed
out
to
me
as
on
the
summit
where
we
stood
are
some
large
heaps
of
hewn
stones
and
several
ruined
walls
with
the
fragments
of
three
large
columns
the
arabs
call
the
spot
el
meysera
arabic
the
zerka
or
jabock
of
the
scriptures
divides
the
district
of
moerad
from
the
country
called
el
belka
arabic
the
highest
summit
of
the
mountains
of
moerad
seems
to
be
considerably
higher
than
any
part
of
the
mountains
of
belka
from
meysera
the
road
continues
over
an
uneven
tract
along
the
summit
of
the
lower
ridge
of
mountains
which
form
the
northern
limits
of
mount
osha
the
belka
we
had
now
entered
a
climate
quite
different
from
that
of
the
ghor
during
the
whole
of
yesterday
we
had
been
much
oppressed
by
heat
which
was
never
lessened
by
the
slightest
breeze
in
the
belka
mountains
on
the
contrary
we
were
refreshed
by
cool
winds
and
every
where
found
a
grateful
shade
of
fine
oak
and
wild
pistachio
trees
with
a
scenery
more
like
that
of
europe
than
any
i
had
yet
seen
in
syria
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
from
meysera
we
passed
a
spring
i
was
told
that
in
the
valley
of
the
zerka
at
about
one
hour
above
its
issue
from
the
mountains
into
the
plain
are
several
hills
called
telloul
el
dahab
arabic
the
hills
of
gold
so
called
as
the
arabs
affirm
from
their
containing
a
gold
mine
in
one
hour
and
a
quarter
we
passed
the
ruined
place
called
el
herath
arabic
the
arabs
cultivate
here
several
fields
of
dhourra
and
cucumbers
my
companions
seeing
no
keepers
in
the
neighbouring
wood
carried
off
more
than
a
quintal
of
cucumbers
about
one
hour
to
the
of
herath
are
the
ruined
places
called
allan
arabic
and
syhhan
arabic
at
the
end
of
two
hours
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
mountain
called
djebel
djelaad
and
djebel
djelaoud
arabic
the
gilead
of
the
scriptures
which
runs
from
east
to
west
and
is
about
two
hours
and
a
half
in
length
upon
it
are
the
ruined
towns
of
djelaad
and
djelaoud
we
ascended
the
western
extremity
of
the
mountain
and
then
reached
the
lofty
mountain
called
djebel
osha
whose
summit
overtops
the
whole
of
the
belka
in
three
hours
and
a
quarter
from
meysera
we
passed
near
the
top
of
mount
osha
arabic
our
general
direction
being
still
the
forest
here
grows
thicker
it
consists
of
oak
bouttom
and
balout
arabic
trees
the
keykab
is
also
very
common
in
three
hours
and
three
quarters
we
descended
the
southern
side
of
the
mountain
near
the
tomb
of
osha
and
reached
szalt
arabic
four
hours
and
a
half
distant
from
meysera
near
the
tomb
of
osha
was
an
encampment
of
about
sixty
tents
szalt
of
the
tribe
of
abad
arabic
they
had
lately
been
robbed
of
almost
all
their
cattle
by
the
beni
szakher
and
were
reduced
to
such
misery
that
they
could
not
afford
to
give
us
a
little
sour
milk
which
we
begged
of
them
they
were
still
at
war
with
the
beni
szakher
and
were
in
hopes
of
recovering
a
part
of
their
property
but
as
they
were
too
weak
to
act
openly
they
had
encamped
for
protection
in
the
neighbourhood
of
their
friends
the
inhabitants
of
szalt
they
intended
to
make
from
hence
some
plundering
excursions
against
their
enemies
for
they
had
now
hardly
any
thing
more
to
lose
in
continuing
at
war
with
them
i
alighted
at
szalt
at
the
house
of
one
of
my
companions
where
i
was
hospitably
entertained
during
the
whole
of
my
stay
at
this
place
the
town
of
szalt
is
situated
on
the
declivity
of
a
hill
crowned
by
a
castle
and
is
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
steep
mountains
it
is
the
only
inhabited
place
in
the
province
of
belka
and
its
inhabitants
are
quite
independent
the
pashas
of
damascus
have
several
times
endeavoured
in
vain
to
subdue
them
abdulla

the
late

besieged
the

for
three
months
without

the
population
consists
of
about
four
hundred
musulman
and
eighty
christian
families
of
the
greek
church
who
live
in
perfect
amity
and

together
the
musulmans
are
composed
of
three
tribes
the
beni
kerad

each
of
which
has
its
separate
quarter
in
the
town
the
principal
sheikhs
at
present
two
in
number
live
in
the
castle
but
they
have
no
other
authority
over
the
rest
than
such
as
a
bedouin
sheikh
exercises
over

was
almost
wholly
rebuilt

was
divided
but
he
was
finally
driven
out
by
the
united

is
well
built
has
a

is
surrounded
by
a
wide

an
old
mosque
is
the
only
object
that
presents
itself
to
the
antiquary
the
christians
have
a
small
church
dedicated
to
the
virgin
where
divine
service
is
performed
by
two
priests
who
each
receive
annually
from
their
community
about
they
are
not
very
rigid
observers
either
of
their
prayers
or
fasts
and
although
it
was
now
the
time
of
lent
with
the
greeks
i
daily
saw
the
most
respectable
christians
eating
flesh
and
butter
the
greater
part
of
the
population
of
szalt
is
agricultural
a
few
are
weavers
and
there
are
about
twenty
shops
which
sell
on
commission
for
the
merchants
of
nazareth
damascus
nablous
and
jerusalem
and
furnish
the
bedouins
with
articles
of
dress

furniture
the
prices
are
at

fifty
per
cent
higher
than
at

the
culture
consists
of
wheat
and
barley
the
superfluous
produce

is
sold
to

vast
quantities

the
arable
fields
are
at

eight
miles
distant
from

in
the
low
grounds
of
the
neighbouring
mountains
where
they
take
advantage
of
the
winter
torrents
in
the
time
of
harvest
the
szaltese
transport
their
families
thither
where
they
live
for
several
months
under
tents
like
true
bedouins
the
principal
encampment
szalt
is
at
a
place
called
feheis
about
one
bour
and
a
half
to
the
of
szalt
in
addition
to
the
means
of
subsistence
just
mentioned
the
inhabitants
of
szalt
have
several
others
in
july
and
august
they
collect
in
the
mountains
of
the
belka
the
leaves
of
the
sumach
which
they
dry
and
carry
to
the
market
at
jerusalem
for
the
use
of
the
tanneries
upwards
of
five
hundred
camel
loads
are
yearly
exported
at
the
rate
of
fifteen
to
eighteen
piastres
the
cwt
the
merchants
also
buy
up
ostrich
feathers
from
the
bedouins
which
they
sell
to
great
advantage
at
damascus
the
food
and
clothing
of
the
szaltese
are
inferior
in
quality
to
those
of
the
peasants
of
northern
syria
their
dress
especially
the
approaches
to
that
of
the
bedouins
their
language
is
the
true
bedouin
dialect
the
only
public
expense
incurred
by
them
is
that
of
entertaining
travellers
for
this
purpose
there
are
four
public
taverns
menzel
or
medhafe
three
belonging
to
the
turks
and
one
to
the
christians
and
whoever
enters
there
is
maintained
as
long
as
he
chooses
provided
his
stay
be
not
prolonged
to
an
unreasonable
period
without
reasons
being
assigned
for
such
delay
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
with
a
proportionate
number
of
cups
of
coffee
are
served
up
to
the
stranger
whoever
he
may
be
for
guests
of
respectability
a
goat
or
lamb
is
slaughtered
and
some
of
the
inhabitants
then
partake
of
the
supper
the
expenses
incurred
by
these
menzels
are
shared
among
the
heads
of
families
according
to
their
respective
wealth
and
every
tavern
has
a
kind
of
landlord
who
keeps
the
accounts
and
provides
the
kitchen
out
of
the
common
stock
i
was
told
that
every
respectable
family
paid
about
fifty
piastres
per
annum
into
the
hands
of
the
master
of
the
menzels
which
makes
altogether
a
sum
of
about
spent
in
the
entertainment
of
strangers
were
the
place
dependent
on
any
turkish
government
more
than
triple
that
sum
would
be
extorted
from
its
inhabitants
for
the
support
of
passengers
besides
the
menzels
every
family
is
always
ready
to
receive
any
acquaintances
who
may
prefer
their
house
to
the
public
inn
it
will
readily
be
conceived
that
upon
these
terms
the
people
of
szalt
are
friends
of
the
neighbouring
bedouins
who
moreover
fear
them
because
they
have
a
secure
retreat
and
can
muster
about
four
hundred
and
from
forty
to
fifty
horses
the
powerful
tribe
of
beni
szakher
alone
is
fearless
of
the
people
of
szalt
on
the
contrary
they
exact
a
small
yearly
tribute
from
the
town
which
is
willingly
paid
in
order
to
secure
the
harvest
against
the
depredations
of
these
formidable
neighbours
disputes
nevertheless
arise
and
szalt
is
often
at
war
with
the
beni
szakher
while
i
remained
at
szalt
i
was
told
of
a
traveller
of
whom
i
had
also
heard
in
the
haouran
he
was
a
christian
of
abyssinia
whose
desire
it
was
to
end
his
days
at
jerusalem
he
first
sailed
from
massoua
to
djidda
where
he
was
seized
by
the
wahabi
and
carried
to
their
chief
ibn
saoud
at
deraye
where
he
remained
two
years
from
deraye
he
crossed
the
desert
with
the
encampments
of
wandering
bedouins
in
the
direction
of
damascus
and
last
year
he
reached
boszra
in
the
haouran
from
whence
he
was
sent
by
the
christians
to
szalt
where
he
remained
a
few
days
and
then
proceeded
for
jerusalem
when
he
arrived
at
the
jordan
he
declared
to
his
companions
that
he
was
a
priest
a
circumstance
which
he
had
always
kept
secret
he
continued
two
days
on
the
banks
of
the
river
fasting
and
praying
and
from
thence
made
his
way
alone
to
jerusalem
he
never
tasted
animal
food
and
although
he
had
experienced
no
sickness
on
the
road
he
died
soon
after
his
arrival
in
the
holy
city
it
was
not
my
intention
to
tarry
at
szalt
i
wished
to
proceed
by
the
first
opportunity
to
kerek
a
town
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
mezar
osha
dead
sea
but
the
communications
in
these
deserted
countries
are
far
from
being
regular
and
the
want
of
a
proper
guide
obliged
me
to
delay
my
departure
for
ten
days
during
this
delay
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
see
the
ruins
of
amman
which
i
had
not
been
able
to
visit
in
the
course
of
my
late
tour
in
the
decapolis
but
before
i
describe
amman
i
shall
subjoin
some
notes
on
the
neighbourhood
of
szalt
a
narrow
valley
leads
up
from
szalt
towards
the
mezar
osha
which
i
have
already
mentioned
half
way
up
the
valley
is
planted
with
vines
which
are
grown
upon
terraces
as
in
mount
libanus
to
prevent
their
being
washed
away
by
the
winter
torrents
the
mezar
osha
is
supposed
to
contain
the
tomb
of
neby
osha
or
the
prophet
hosea
equally
revered
by
turks
and
christians
and
to
whom
the
followers
of
both
religions
are
in
the
habit
of
offering
prayers
and
sacrifices
the
latter
consist
generally
of
a
sheep
to
be
slain
in
honour
of
the
saint
or
of
some
perfumes
to
be
burnt
over
his
tomb
i
was
invited
to
partake
of
a
sheep
presented
by
a
suppliant
to
whose
prayers
the
saint
had
been
favourable
there
was
a
large
party
and
we
spent
a
very
pleasant
day
under
a
fine
just
by
the
tomb
the
wives
and
daughters
of
those
who
were
invited
were
present
and
mixed
freely
in
the
conversation
the
tomb
is
covered
by
a
vaulted
building
one
end
of
which
serves
as
a
mosque
the
tomb
itself
in
the
form
of
a
coffin
is
feet
long
three
feet
broad
and
three
feet
and
a
half
in
height
being
thus
constructed
in
conformity
with
the
notion
of
the
turks
who
suppose
that
all
our
forefathers
were
giants
and
especially
the
prophets
before
mohammed
the
tomb
of
noah
in
the
valley
of
is
still
longer
the
coffin
of
osha
is
covered
with
silk
stuffs
of
different
colours
which
have
been
presented
to
him
as
votive
offerings
visitors
generally
throw
a
couple
of
paras
upon
the
tomb
these
are
collected
by
the
guardian
and
pay
the
expenses
of
illuminating
the
apartment
during
the
summer
months
for
in
the
winter
season
hardly
any
body
seeks
favours
at
the
shrine
of
the
saint
in
one

i
found
it
impossible
at
szalt
to
procure
a
guide
to
amman
the
country
was
in
a
state
which
rendered
it
very
dangerous
to
travel
through
it
the
beni
szakher
were
at
war
with
the
arabs
of
adouan
with
the
government
of
damascus
and
with
the
rowalla
a
branch
of
the
aeneze
and
we
heard
daily
of
skirmishes
taking
place
between
the
contending
parties
principally
near
the
river
zerka
amman
being
a
noted
spring
was
frequented
by
both
the
hostile
parties
and
although
the
people
of
szalt
were
now
at
peace
with
the
beni
szakher
having
concluded
it
on
the
day
of
my
arrival
yet
they
were
upon
very
indifferent
terms
with
the
feheis
adouan
and
rowalla
i
had
once
engaged
four
armed
men
to
accompany
me
on
foot
to
the
place
but
when
we
were
just
setting
out
after
sunset
their
wives
came
crying
to
my
lodging
and
upbraided
their
husbands
with
madness
in
exposing
their
lives
for
a
couple
of
piastres
being
equally
unsuccessful
in
several
other
attempts
and
tired
of
the
exaggerations
of
my
who
pretended
that
i
should
be
in
danger
of
being
stripped
and
even
killed
i
at
length
became
impatient
and
quitting
szalt
in
the
evening
of
the
i
rode
over
to
feheis
where
the
greater
part
of
the
szaltese
were
encamped
for
the
labours
of
the
harvest
and
where
it
was
more
likely
that
i
should
meet
with
a
guide
on
my
way
i
passed
the
deep
wady
ezrak
arabic
where
is
a
rivulet
and
several
mills
el
feheis
is
a
ruined
city
with
a
spring
near
it
here
are
the
remains
of
an
arched
building
in
which
the
christians
sometimes
perform
divine
service
below
feheis
upon
the
top
of
a
lower
mountain
is
the
ruined
place
called
el
khandok
arabic
which
appears
to
have
been
a
fort
it
is
surrounded
with
a
wall
of
large
stones
and
the
remains
of
several
bastions
are
visible
from
a
point
near
khandok
the
dead
sea
which
i
saw
for
the
first
time
bears
at
feheis
i
was
so
fortunate
as
to
find
a
guide
who
five
years
ago
had
served
in
the
same
capacity
to
mousa
the
name
assumed
by
seetzen
as
he
was
well
acquainted
with
all
the
bedouins
and
on
friendly
terms
with
them
he
engaged
to
take
me
to
amman
in
company
with
another
horseman
july
set
off
before
sunrise
on
leaving
feheis
we
crossed
a
mountainous
country
passed
through
a
thick
forest
of
oak
trees
and
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
reached
the
ardh
el
hemar
which
is
the
name
of
a
district
extending
north
and
south
for
about
two
hours
here
are
a
number
of
springs
which
have
rendered
it
a
amman
favourite
place
of
resort
of
the
bedouins
the
valley
was
covered
with
a
fine
coat
of
verdant
pasture
from
hence
the
road
ascended
through
oak
woods
and
pleasant
hills
over
flinty
ground
till
we
reached
after
a
march
of
two
hours
and
a
half
an
elevated
plain
from
whence
we
had
an
extensive
view
towards
the
east
the
plain
which
in
this
part
is
called
el
ahma
arabic
is
a
fertile
tract
interspersed
with
low
hills
these
are
for
the
greater
part
crowned
with
ruins
but
they
are
of
irregular
forms
unlike
the
tels
or
artificial
heights
of
the
haouran
and
of
northern
syria
just
by
the
road
at
the
end
of
three
hours
are
the
ruins
called
el
kholda
arabic
to
the
left
are
the
ruins
of
kherbet
karakagheish
arabic
and
to
the
right
at
half
an
distance
the
ruins
of
sar
arabic
and
fokhara
arabic
at
about
one
hour
south
of
sar
begins
the
district
called
kattar
arabic
or
marka
arabic
the
ruins
which
we
passed
here
as
well
as
all
those
before
mentioned
in
the
mountains
of
belka
present
no
objects
of
any
interest
they
consist
of
a
few
walls
of
dwelling
houses
heaps
of
stones
the
foundations
of
some
public
edifices
and
a
few
cisterns
now
filled
up
there
is
nothing
entire
but
it
appears
that
the
mode
of
building
was
very
solid
all
the
remains
being
formed
of
large
stones
it
is
evident
also
that
the
whole
of
the
country
must
have
been
extremely
well
cultivated
in
order
to
have
afforded
subsistence
to
the
inhabitants
of
so
many
towns
at
the
end
of
three
hours
and
a
half
we
entered
a
broad
valley
which
brought
us
in
half
an
hour
to
the
ruins
of
amman
which
lies
about
nineteen
english
miles
to
the
by
of
szalt
the
annexed
plan
not
included
will
give
an
idea
of
the
situation
and
ruins
of
amman
one
of
the
most
ancient
of
the
cities
recorded
in
jewish
history
the
town
lies
along
the
banks
of
a
river
called
moiet
amman
which
has
its
source
in
a
pond
a
at
a
few
hundred
paces
from
the
end
of
the
town
i
was
informed
that
this
river
is
lost
in
the
earth
one
hour
below
the
pond
that
it
issues
again
and
takes
the
name
of
ain
ghazale
arabic
then
disappears
a
second
time
and
rises
again
near
a
ruined
place
called
reszeyfa
arabic
beyond
which
it
is
said
to
be
lost
for
a
third
time
till
it
reappears
about
an
hour
to
the
west
of
kalaat
zerka
otherwise
called
kaszr
shebeib
arabic
near
the
river
zerka
into
which
it
empties
itself
ain
ghazale
is
about
one
hour
and
a
half
distant
from
amman
kalaat
zerka
is
four
hours
distant
the
river
of
amman
runs
in
a
valley
bordered
on
both
sides
by
barren
hills
of
flint
which
advance
on
the
south
side
close
to
the
edge
of
the
stream
the
edifices
which
still
remain
to
attest
the
former
splendour
of
amman
are
the
following
a
spacious
church
b
built
with
large
stones
and
having
a
steeple
of
the
shape
of
those
which
i
saw
in
several
ruined
towns
in
the
haouran
there
are
wide
arches
in
the
walls
of
the
small
building
c
with
niches
probably
a
temple
d
of
which
a
part
of
the
side
walls
and
a
niche
in
the
back
wall
are
remaining
there
are
no
ornaments
either
on
the
walls
or
about
the
curved
wall
e
along
the
water
side
with
many
niches
before
it
was
a
row
of
large
columns
of
which
four
remain
but
without
capitals
i
conjecture
this
to
have
been
a
kind
of
stoa
or
public
walk
it
does
not
communicate
with
any
other
high
arched
bridge
f
over
the
river
this
appears
to
have
been
the
only
bridge
in
the
town
although
the
river
is
not
fordable
in
the
winter
the
banks
of
the
river
as
well
as
its
bed
are
paved
but
the
pavement
has
been
in
most
places
carried
away
by
the
violence
of
the
winter
torrent
the
stream
is
full
of
small
fish
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
is
a
fine
theatre
the
largest
that
i
have
seen
in
syria
it
has
forty
rows
of
seats
between
the
tenth
and
eleventh
from
the
bottom
occurs
a
row
of
eight
boxes
or
small
apartments
capable
of
holding
about
twelve
spectators
each
fourteen
rows
higher
a
similar
row
of
boxes
occupies
the
place
of
the
middle
seats
and
at
the
top
of
all
there
is
a
third
tier
of
boxes
excavated
in
the
rocky
side
of
the
hill
upon
the
declivity
of
which
the
theatre
is
built
on
both
wings
of
the
theatre
are
vaults
in
front
was
a
colonnade
of
which
eight
corinthian
columns
yet
remain
besides
four
fragments
of
shafts
they
are
about
fifteen
feet
high
surmounted
by
an
entablature
still
entire
this
colonnade
must
have
had
at
least
fifty
columns
the
workmanship
is
not
of
the
best
roman
times
near
this
theatre
is
a
building
h
the
details
of
which
i
was
not
able
to
make
out
exactly
its
front
is
built
irregularly
without
columns
or
ornaments
of
any
kind
on
entering
i
found
a
area
enclosed
by
a
high
wall
in
which
narrow
steps
were
formed
running
all
round
from
bottom
to
top
the
inside
of
the
front
wall
as
well
as
the
round
wall
of
the
area
is
richly
ornamented
with
sculptured
ornaments
the
roof
which
once
covered
the
whole
building
has
fallen
down
and
choaks
up
the
interior
in
such
a
way
as
to
render
it
difficult
to
determine
whether
the
edifice
has
been
a
palace
or
destined
for
public
amusements
nearly
opposite
the
theatre
to
the
northward
of
the
river
are
the
remains
of
a
temple
k
the
posterior
wall
of
which
only
remains
having
an
entablature
and
several
niches
highly
adorned
with
sculpture
before
this
building
stand
the
shafts
of
several
columns
three
feet
in
diameter
its
date
appears
to
be
anterior
to
that
of
all
the
other
buildings
of
amman
and
its
style
of
architecture
is
much
superior
at
some
distance
farther
down
the
wady
stand
a
few
small
columns
i
probably
the
remains
of
a
temple
the
plain
between
the
river
and
the
northern
hills
is
covered
with
ruins
of
private
buildings
extending
from
the
church
c
down
to
the
columns
i
but
nothing
of
them
remains
except
the
foundations
and
some
of
the
door
posts
on
the
top
of
the
highest
of
the
northern
hills
stands
the
castle
of
amman
a
very
extensive
building
it
was
an
oblong
square
filled
with
buildings
of
which
about
as
much
remains
as
there
does
of
the
private
dwellings
in
the
lower
town
the
castle
walls
are
thick
and
denote
a
remote
antiquity
large
blocks
of
stone
are
piled
up
without
cement
and
still
hold
together
as
well
as
if
they
had
been
recently
placed
the
greater
part
of
the
wall
is
entire
it
is
placed
a
little
below
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
appears
not
to
have
risen
much
above
the
level
of
its
summit
within
the
castle
are
several
deep
cisterns
at
m
is
a
square
building
in
complete
preservation
constructed
in
the
same
manner
as
the
castle
wall
it
is
without
ornaments
and
the
only
opening
into
it
is
a
low
door
over
which
was
an
inscription
now
defaced
near
this
building
are
the
traces
of
a
large
temple
n
several
of
its
broken
columns
are
lying
on
the
ground
they
are
the
largest
i
saw
at
amman
some
of
them
being
three
feet
and
a
half
in
diameter
their
capitals
are
of
the
corinthian
order
on
the
north
side
of
the
castle
is
a
ditch
cut
in
the
rock
for
the
better
defence
of
this
side
of
the
hill
which
is
less
steep
than
the
others
the
ruins
of
amman
being
with
the
exception
of
a
few
walls
of
flint
of
calcareous
stone
of
moderate
hardness
have
not
resisted
the
ravages
of
time
so
well
as
those
of
djerash
the
buildings
exposed
to
the
atmosphere
are
all
in
decay
so
that
there
is
little
hope
of
finding
any
inscriptions
here
which
might
illustrate
the
history
of
the
place
the
construction
shews
that
the
edifices
were
of
different
ages
as
in
the
other
cities
of
the
decapolis
which
i
have
examined
i
am
sensible
that
the
above
description
of
amman
though
it
notices
all
the
principal
remains
is
still
very
imperfect
but
a
traveller
who
is
not
accompanied
with
an
armed
force
can
never
hope
to
give
very
satisfactory
accounts
of
the
antiquities
of
these
deserted
countries
my
guides
had
observed
some
fresh
near
the
side
which
greatly
alarmed
them
as
it
was
a
proof
that
szafout
some
bedouins
were
hovering
about
they
insisted
upon
my
returning
immediately
and
refusing
to
wait
for
me
a
moment
rode
off
while
i
was
still
occupied
in
writing
a
few
notes
upon
the
theatre
i
hastily
mounted
the
castle
hill
ran
over
its
ruins
and
galloping
after
my
guides
joined
them
at
half
an
hour
from
the
town
when
i
reproached
them
for
their
cowardice
they
replied
that
i
certainly
could
not
suppose
that
for
the
twelve
piastres
i
had
agreed
to
give
them
they
should
expose
themselves
to
the
danger
of
being
stripped
and
of
losing
their
horses
from
a
mere
foolish
caprice
of
mine
to
write
down
the
stones
i
have
often
been
obliged
to
yield
to
similar
reasoning
a
true
bedouin
however
never
abandons
his
companion
in
this
manner
whoever
therefore
wishes
to
travel
in
these
parts
and
to
make
accurate
observations
will
do
well
to
take
with
him
as
many
horsemen
as
may
secure
him
against
any
strolling
party
of
robbers
about
four
or
five
bours
from
amman
are
the
ruins
called
el
kohf
arabic
with
a
large
temple
and
many
columns
about
eight
hours
is
the
ruined
city
of
om
el
reszasz
arabic
the
mother
of
lead
which
according
to
all
accounts
is
of
great
extent
and
contains
large
buildings
in
my
present
situation
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
visit
these
two
places
i
hope
that
some
future
traveller
will
be
more
fortunate
we
returned
from
amman
by
a
more
northern
route
at
one
hour
and
three
quarters
we
passed
the
ruined
place
called
djebeyha
arabic
in
two
hours
the
ruins
of
meraze
arabic
the
hills
which
rise
over
the
plain
are
covered
to
their
tops
with
thick
heath
at
two
hours
and
a
half
are
the
ruins
of
om
djouze
arabic
with
a
spring
sources
of
water
are
seldom
met
with
in
this
upper
plain
of
the
belka
a
circumstance
that
greatly
enhances
the
importance
of
the
situation
of
amman
at
three
hours
and
a
half
is
szalt
szafout
arabic
where
are
ruins
of
some
extent
with
a
spring
the
gate
of
a
public
edifice
is
still
standing
to
the
north
and
east
of
this
place
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
on
which
it
stands
extends
a
broad
valley
called
el
bekka
arabic
it
is
extremely
fertile
and
is
in
part
cultivated
by
the
people
of
szalt
and
the
arabs
of
the
belka
the
beni
szakher
had
burnt
up
the
whole
of
the
crops
before
they
concluded
peace
with
szalt
in
the
bekka
is
a
ruined
place
called
ain
el
basha
arabic
with
a
spring
from
szafout
we
returned
by
ardh
el
hemar
to
feheis
which
we
reached
in
four
hours
and
a
half
from
szafout
near
the
springs
of
hemar
we
found
a
cow
that
had
gone
astray
from
some
bedouin
encampment
my
guides
immediately
declared
her
to
be
a
fair
prize
and
drove
her
off
before
them
to
feheis
where
she
was
killed
to
prevent
the
owner
from
claiming
her
and
the
encampment
feasted
upon
the
flesh
for
two
days
from
szafout
distant
about
two
hours
is
a
ruined
city
with
several
edifices
still
standing
called
yadjoush
arabic
of
amman
two
hours
is
a
ruined
building
called
el
nowakys
arabic
on
the
interior
wall
of
which
are
some
busts
in
relief
according
to
the
report
of
one
who
had
seen
them
but
whose
veracity
was
rather
doubtful
on
my
return
to
szalt
i
was
obliged
to
remain
there
several
days
longer
for
want
of
a
guide
for
the
road
to
kerek
is
a
complete
desert
and
much
exposed
to
the
inroads
of
the
arabs
at
last
i
found
a
man
who
engaged
to
serve
me
but
his
demands
were
so
exorbitant
that
i
was
several
days
in
bargaining
with
him
mousa
seetzen
he
said
had
paid
his
guide
piastres
for
the
trip
from
hence
to
kerek
and
he
would
not
therefore
go
the
same
road
for
less
than
three
this
was
an
enormous
sum
for
a
journey
of
two
days
in
a
country
where
an
arab
will
toil
for
a
fortnight
without
obtaining
so
great
a
sum
my
principal
mekabbely
objection
to
paying
so
much
was
that
it
would
become
known
at
kerek
which
besides
other
difficulties
it
might
bring
me
into
would
have
obliged
me
to
pay
all
my
future
guides
in
the
same
proportion
my
landlord
however
removed
this
objection
by
making
the
guide
take
a
solemn
oath
that
he
would
never
confess
to
having
received
more
than
six
piastres
for
his
trouble
there
was
no
other
proper
guide
to
be
got
and
i
began
to
be
tired
of
szalt
for
i
saw
that
my
landlord
was
very
earnest
in
his
endeavours
to
get
me
away
i
resolved
therefore
to
trust
to
my
good
fortune
and
to
set
out
with
no
other
company
than
that
of
an
armed
horseman
in
the
evening
i
returned
to
feheis
from
whence
we
departed
early
the
next
morning
july
passed
ardh
el
hemar
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
are
the
ruined
places
el
ryhha
arabic
shakour
arabic
meghanny
arabic
and
mekabbely
arabic
and
at
a
short
distance
farther
on
in
the
wood
we
met
two
men
quite
naked
whenever
the
bedouins
meet
any
other
arabs
in
the
desert
of
inferior
force
and
who
are
unknown
to
them
they
level
their
lances
and
stop
their
horses
within
about
ten
yards
of
the
strangers
to
enquire
whether
they
are
friends
or
not
my
guide
had
seen
the
two
men
at
a
great
distance
among
the
trees
be
called
to
me
to
get
my
gun
ready
and
we
galloped
towards
them
but
they
no
sooner
saw
us
than
they
stopped
and
cried
out
are
under
your
protection
they
then
told
us
that
they
were
peasants
of
a
village
near
rieha
or
jericho
that
they
had
been
carried
away
from
their
own
fields
by
a
party
of
beni
szakher
with
whom
their
village
happened
to
be
at
war
as
far
as
yadjoush
where
the
latter
had
encampments
that
after
being
required
to
pay
the
price
of
blood
of
one
of
the
tribe
slain
by
the
inhabitants
of
their
village
they
had
been
beaten
and
stripped
naked
but
that
at
last
they
had
found
means
to
escape
their
bruises
and
sores
bore
testimony
merdj
ekke
to
the
truth
of
their
story
instances
of
such
acts
of
violence
frequently
occur
in
the
desert
in
one
hour
and
three
quarters
we
came
to
the
ruins
of
kherbet
tabouk
arabic
which
seems
to
have
been
a
place
of
some
importance
many
wild
grow
here
the
direction
of
our
road
was
here
the
woody
country
terminates
and
we
found
ourselves
again
upon
the
high
plain
called
el
ahma
which
has
fertile
ground
but
no
trees
at
two
hours
and
a
quarter
is
a
ruined
birket
or
reservoir
of
rain
water
called
om
aamoud
arabic
from
some
fragments
of
columns
which
are
found
here
in
two
hours
and
a
half
we
passed
on
our
right
the
wady
szyr
arabic
which
has
its
source
near
the
road
und
falls
below
into
the
jordan
above
the
source
on
the
declivity
of
the
valley
are
the
ruins
called
szyr
we
continued
to
travel
along
a
well
trodden
road
for
the
greater
part
of
the
day
at
three
hours
were
the
ruins
of
szar
to
our
left
at
three
hours
and
a
half
and
about
half
an
hour
west
of
the
road
are
the
ruins
of
fokhara
on
the
side
of
the
wady
eshta
arabic
which
empties
itself
into
the
jordan
here
are
a
number
of
wild
the
whole
of
the
country
to
the
right
of
the
road
is
intersected
with
deep
wadys
and
precipices
and
is
overgrown
in
many
parts
with
fine
woods
we
had
at
intervals
a
view
of
the
ghor
below
to
the
left
of
the
road
is
the
great
plain
with
many
insulated
hillocks
in
three
hours
and
a
half
we
passed
a
hill
called
dhaheret
el
hemar
arabic
or
the
back
at
three
hours
and
three
quarters
to
the
right
are
the
ruins
of
meraszas
arabic
with
a
heap
of
stones
called
redjem
abd
reshyd
arabic
where
according
to
bedouin
tradition
a
wonderful
battle
took
place
between
a
slave
of
an
arab
called
reshyd
and
a
whole
party
of
his
enemies
here
terminates
the
district
el
ahma
to
the
left
are
the
ruins
called
merdj
ekke
arabic
the
soil
in
this
vicinity
is
chalky
last
year
a
battle
was
fought
here
between
the
troops
of
the
pasha
of
damascus
el
aal
and
the
beni
szakher
in
which
the
former
were
routed
at
four
hours
and
a
half
and
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
to
our
right
we
saw
the
ruins
of
naour
arabic
on
the
side
of
a
rivulet
of
that
name
which
falls
into
the
jordan
opposite
rieha
or
jericho
driving
in
its
course
several
mills
where
the
bedouins
of
the
belka
grind
their
corn
on
both
sides
of
the
road
are
many
vestiges
of
ancient
from
naour
our
road
lay
at
five
hours
and
three
quarters
are
the
ruins
of
el
aal
arabic
probably
the
eleale
of
the
scriptures
it
stands
upon
the
summit
of
a
hill
and
takes
its
name
from
its
situation
aal
meaning
it
commands
the
whole
plain
and
the
view
from
the
top
of
the
hill
is
very
extensive
comprehending
the
whole
of
the
southern
belka
from
hence
the
mountain
of
shyhhan
arabic
behind
which
lies
kerek
bears
by
el
aal
was
surrounded
by
a
well
built
wall
of
which
some
parts
yet
remain
among
the
ruins
are
a
number
of
large
cisterns
fragments
of
walls
and
the
foundations
of
houses
but
nothing
worth
particular
notice
the
plain
around
is
alternately
chalk
and
flint
at
six
hours
and
a
quarter
is
hesban
arabic
upon
a
hill
bearing
from
el
aal
here
are
the
ruins
of
a
large
ancient
town
together
with
the
remains
of
some
edifices
built
with
small
stones
a
few
broken
shafts
of
columns
are
still
standing
a
number
of
deep
wells
cut
in
the
rock
and
a
large
reservoir
of
water
for
the
summer
supply
of
the
inhabitants
at
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
of
hesban
are
the
ruins
of
myoun
arabic
the
ancient
baal
meon
arabic
of
the
tribe
of
ruben
in
order
to
see
medaba
i
left
the
great
road
at
hesban
and
proceeded
in
a
more
eastern
direction
at
six
hours
and
three
quarters
about
one
hour
distant
from
the
road
i
saw
the
ruins
of
djeloul
arabic
at
a
short
distance
to
the
east
of
which
are
the
ruined
places
called
el
samek
arabic
el
mesouh
arabic
and
madeba
om
el
aamed
arabic
situated
close
together
upon
low
elevations
at
about
four
hours
distant
to
the
east
of
our
road
i
observed
a
chain
of
hills
which
begins
near
kalaat
zerka
passes
to
the
east
of
amman
near
the
kalaat
el
belka
a
station
of
the
syrian
hadj
called
by
the
bedouins
kalaat
remeydan
arabic
and
continues
as
far
as
wady
modjeb
the
mountains
bear
the
name
of
el
zoble
arabic
the
hadj
route
to
mekka
lies
along
their
western
side
at
seven
hours
and
a
quarter
is
el
kefeyrat
arabic
a
ruined
town
of
some
extent
in
seven
hours
and
a
half
we
came
to
the
remains
of
a
well
paved
ancient
causeway
my
guide
told
me
that
this
had
been
formerly
the
route
of
the
hadj
and
that
the
pavement
was
made
by
the
mohammedans
but
it
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
roman
work
at
the
end
of
eight
hours
we
reached
madeba
built
upon
a
round
hill
this
is
the
ancient
medaba
but
there
is
no
river
near
it
it
is
at
least
half
an
hour
in
circumference
i
observed
many
remains
of
the
walls
of
private
houses
constructed
with
blocks
of
silex
but
not
a
single
edifice
is
standing
there
is
a
large
birket
which
as
there
is
no
spring
at
madeba
might
still
be
of
use
to
the
bedouins
were
the
surrounding
ground
cleared
of
the
rubbish
to
allow
the
water
to
flow
into
it
but
such
an
undertaking
is
far
beyond
the
views
of
the
wandering
arab
on
the
west
side
of
the
town
are
the
foundations
of
a
temple
built
with
large
stones
and
apparently
of
great
antiquity
the
annexed
is
its
form
and
dimensions
a
part
of
its
eastern
wall
remains
constructed
in
the
same
style
as
the
castle
wall
at
amman
at
the
entrance
of
one
of
the
courts
stand
two
columns
of
the
doric
order
each
of
two
pieces
without
bases
and
thicker
in
the
centre
than
at
either
extremity
a
peculiarity
of
which
this
is
the
only
instance
i
have
seen
in
syria
more
modern
capitals
have
been
added
one
of
which
is
corinthian
and
the
other
doric
and
an
equally
coarse
architrave
has
been
laid
upon
them
in
the
centre
of
one
of
the
courts
is
a
large
well
about
half
an
hour
west
of
madeba
arabic
are
the
ruins
of
el
teym
arabic
perhaps
the
kerjathaim
of
the
scripture
where
according
to
my
guide
a
very
large
birket
is
cut
entirely
in
the
rock
and
is
still
filled
in
the
winter
with
rain
water
as
there
are
no
springs
in
this
part
of
the
upper
plain
of
the
belka
the
inha
bi
tants
were
obliged
to
provide
by
cisterns
for
their
supply
of
water
during
the
summer
months
we
returned
from
madeba
towards
the
great
road
where
we
fell
in
with
a
large
party
of
bedouins
on
foot
who
were
going
to
rob
by
night
an
encampment
of
beni
szakher
at
least
fourteen
hours
distant
from
hence
each
of
them
had
a
small
bag
of
flower
on
his
back
some
were
armed
with
guns
and
others
with
sticks
i
was
afterwards
informed
that
they
drove
off
above
a
dozen
camels
belonging
to
the
beni
szakher
they
pointed
out
to
us
the
place
where
their
tribe
was
encamped
and
as
we
were
then
looking
out
for
some
place
where
we
might
get
a
supper
of
which
we
stood
in
great
need
we
followed
the
direction
they
gave
us
in
turning
a
little
westwards
we
entered
the
mountainous
country
which
forms
the
eastern
border
of
the
valley
of
the
jordan
and
descending
in
a
direction
along
the
windings
of
a
wady
we
arrived
at
a
large
encampment
of
bedouins
at
the
end
of
ten
hours
and
a
half
from
our
setting
out
in
the
morning
the
upper
part
of
the
mountains
consists
entirely
of
siliceous
rock
we
passed
on
the
road
several
spots
where
the
bedouins
cultivate
dhourra
we
were
well
received
by
the
bedouins
of
the
encampment
who
are
on
good
terms
with
the
people
of
szalt
one
of
the
principal
sheikhs
of
which
place
is
married
to
the
daughter
of
the
chief
of
this
tribe
they
belong
to
the
ghanemat
whose
sheikh
called
the
belka
abd
el
mohsen
arabic
is
one
of
the
first
men
in
the
belka
the
chief
tribe
in
this
province
for
many
years
was
the
adouan
but
they
are
now
reduced
to
the
lowest
condition
by
their
inveterate
enemies
the
beni
szakher
the
latter
whose
abode
had
for
a
long
space
of
time
been
on
the
hadj
road
near
oella
arabic
were
obliged
by
the
increasing
power
of
the
wahabi
to
retire
towards
the
north
they
approached
the
belka
and
obtained
from
the
adouan
who
were
then
in
possession
of
the
excellent
pasturage
of
this
country
permission
to
feed
their
cattle
here
on
paying
a
small
annual
tribute
they
soon
proved
however
to
be
dangerous
neighbours
having
detached
the
greater
part
of
the
other
tribes
of
the
belka
from
their
alliance
with
the
adouan
they
have
finally
succeeded
in
driving
the
latter
across
the
zerka
notwithstanding
the
assistance
which
they
received
from
the
pasha
of
damascus
peace
had
been
made
in
and
both
tribes
had
encamped
together
near
amman
when
hamoud
el
szaleh
chief
of
the
adouan
made
a
secret
arrangement
with
the
troops
and
the
tribe
of
rowalla
who
were
at
war
with
the
beni
szakher
to
make
a
united
attack
upon
them
the
plot
was
well
laid
but
the
valour
of
the
beni
szakher
proved
a
match
for
the
united
forces
of
their
enemies
they
lost
only
about
a
dozen
of
their
horsemen
and
about
two
thousand
sheep
and
since
that
time
an
inveterate
enmity
has
existed
between
the
beni
szakher
and
the
adouan
the
second
chief
of
adouan
an
old
man
with
thirteen
sons
who
always
accompany
him
to
the
field
joined
the
beni
szakher
as
did
also
the
greater
part
of
the
arabs
of
the
belka
in
the
adouan
were
driven
into
the
mountains
of
adjeloun
and
to
all
appearance
will
never
be
able
to
the
belka
for
the
enumeration
of
the
belka
arabs
see
the
classification
of
syrian
bedouins
in
the
appendix
the
superiority
of
the
pasturage
of
the
belka
over
that
of
all
southern
syria
is
the
cause
of
its
possession
being
thus
contested
zerka
mayn
the
bedouins
have
this
saying
canst
not
find
a
country
like
the
el
belka
ma
teltaka
arabic
the
beef
and
mutton
of
this
district
are
preferred
to
those
of
all
others
the
bedouins
of
the
belka
are
nominally
subject
to
an
annual
tribute
to
the
pasha
of
damascus
but
they
are
very
frequently
in
rebellion
and
pay
only
when
threatened
by
a
superior
force
for
the
last
two
years
abd
el
mohsen
has
not
paid
any
thing
the
contribution
of
the
adouan
is
tenth
of
the
produce
of
their
camels
sheep
goats
and
cows
besides
ten
pounds
of
butter
for
every
hundred
sheep
the
hundred
of
any
kind
of
cattle
is
here
called
shilleie
arabic
the
arabs
of
the
belka
have
few
camels
but
their
herds
of
cows
sheep
and
goats
are
large
and
whenever
they
have
a
prospect
of
being
able
to
secure
the
harvest
against
the
incursions
of
enemies
they
cultivate
patches
of
the
best
soil
in
their
territory
in
summer
they
remain
in
the
valleys
on
the
side
of
the
ghor
in
the
winter
a
part
of
them
descend
into
the
ghor
itself
while
the
others
encamp
upon
the
upper
plain
of
the
belka
july
left
the
encampment
of
abd
el
mohsen
early
in
the
morning
and
at
one
hour
from
it
descending
along
a
winding
valley
we
reached
the
banks
of
the
rivulet
zerka
mayn
arabic
which
is
not
to
be
confounded
with
the
northern
zerka
its
source
is
not
far
from
hence
it
flows
in
a
deep
and
barren
valley
through
a
wood
of
defle
trees
which
form
a
canopy
over
the
rivulet
impenetrable
to
the
meridian
sun
the
red
flowers
of
these
trees
reflected
in
the
river
gave
it
the
appearance
of
a
bed
of
roses
and
presented
a
singular
contrast
with
the
whitish
gray
rocks
which
border
the
wood
on
either
side
all
these
mountains
are
calcareous
mixed
with
some
flint
the
water
of
the
zerka
mayn
is
almost
warm
and
has
a
disagreeable
taste
occasioned
probably
by
the
quantity
of
defle
flowers
that
fall
into
it
having
crossed
the
river
we
ascended
the
steep
side
of
the
mountain
houma
arabic
wady
wale
at
the
top
of
which
we
saw
the
summit
of
djebel
attarous
arabic
about
half
an
hour
distant
to
our
right
this
is
the
highest
point
in
the
neighbourhood
and
seems
to
be
the
mount
nebo
of
the
scripture
on
its
summit
is
a
heap
of
stones
overshaded
by
a
very
large
wild
pistachio
tree
at
a
short
distance
below
to
the
is
the
ruined
place
called
kereyat
arabic
the
part
of
the
mountain
over
which
we
rode
was
completely
barren
with
an
uneven
plain
on
its
top
in
two
hours
and
a
half
we
saw
at
about
half
an
hour
to
our
right
the
ruins
of
a
place
called
lob
which
are
of
some
extent
we
passed
an
encampment
of
arabs
ghanamat
at
the
end
of
three
hours
and
three
quarters
after
an
steep
descent
we
reached
wady
wale
arabic
the
stream
contains
a
little
more
water
than
the
zerka
mayn
it
runs
in
a
rocky
bed
in
the
holes
of
which
innumerable
fish
were
playing
i
killed
several
by
merely
throwing
stones
into
the
water
the
banks
of
the
rivulet
are
overgrown
with
willows
defle
and
tamarisks
arabic
and
i
saw
large
petrifactions
of
shells
in
the
valley
about
one
hour
to
the
west
of
the
spot
where
we
passed
the
wale
are
the
ruins
of
a
small
castle
situated
on
the
summit
of
a
lower
ridge
of
mountains
the
arabs
call
it
keraoum
abou
el
hossein
arabic
in
the
valley
of
wale
a
large
party
of
arabs
sherarat
was
encamped
bedouins
of
the
arabian
desert
who
resort
hither
in
summer
for
pasturage
they
are
a
tribe
of
upwards
of
five
thousand
tents
but
not
having
been
able
to
possess
themselves
of
a
district
fertile
in
pasturage
and
being
hemmed
in
by
the
northern
aeneze
the
aeneze
of
the
nedjed
the
howeytat
and
beni
szakher
they
wander
about
in
misery
have
very
few
horses
and
are
not
able
to
feed
any
flocks
of
sheep
or
goats
they
live
principally
on
the
hadj
route
towards
maan
and
in
summer
approach
the
belka
pushing
northward
sometimes
as
far
as
haouran
they
wady
modjeb
are
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
encamping
on
spots
where
the
beni
szakher
and
the
aeneze
with
whom
they
always
endeavour
to
live
at
peace
do
not
choose
to
pasture
their
cattle
the
only
wealth
of
the
sherarat
consists
in
camels
their
tents
are
very
miserable
both
men
and
women
go
almost
naked
the
former
being
only
covered
round
the
waist
and
the
women
wearing
nothing
but
a
loose
shirt
hanging
in
rags
about
them
these
arabs
are
much
leaner
than
the
aeneze
and
of
a
browner
complexion
they
have
the
reputation
of
being
very
sly
and
enterprising
thieves
a
title
by
which
they
think
themselves
greatly
honoured
in
four
hours
and
a
half
after
having
ascended
the
mountain
on
the
side
of
the
wale
we
reached
a
fine
plain
on
its
summit
all
the
country
to
the
southward
of
the
wale
as
far
as
the
wady
modjeb
is
comprised
under
the
appellation
of
el
koura
a
term
often
applied
in
syria
to
plains
el
koura
is
the
of
of
the
scripture
the
soil
is
very
sandy
and
not
fertile
the
haouran
black
stone
or
basalt
if
it
may
be
so
called
is
again
met
with
here
the
river
el
wale
rises
at
about
three
hours
distance
to
the
of
the
spot
where
we
passed
it
near
which
it
takes
a
winding
course
to
the
south
until
it
approaches
the
modjeb
where
it
again
turns
westwards
the
lower
part
of
the
river
changes
its
name
into
that
of
seyl
heydan
arabic
which
empties
itself
into
the
modjeb
at
about
two
hours
distant
from
the
dead
sea
near
the
ruined
place
called
dar
el
ryashe
arabic
the
wale
seems
to
be
the
same
called
nahaliel
in
map
but
this
name
is
unknown
to
the
arabs
its
source
is
not
so
far
northward
as
in
the
map
between
the
wady
zerka
mayn
and
the
wale
is
another
small
rivulet
called
wady
el
djebel
arabic
at
the
end
of
six
hours
and
a
half
we
reached
the
banks
of
the
wady
modjeb
the
arnon
of
the
scriptures
which
divides
the
province
of
belka
from
that
of
kerek
as
it
formerly
divided
the
small
kingdoms
of
the
moabites
and
the
amorites
when
at
about
one
distance
short
of
the
modjeb
i
was
shewn
to
the
of
us
the
ruins
of
diban
arabic
the
ancient
dibon
situated
in
a
low
ground
of
the
koura
on
the
spot
where
we
reached
the
high
banks
of
the
modjeb
are
the
ruins
of
a
place
called
akeb
el
debs
arabic
we
followed
from
thence
the
top
of
the
precipice
at
the
foot
of
which
the
river
flows
in
an
eastern
direction
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
we
reached
the
ruins
of
araayr
arabic
the
aroer
of
the
scriptures
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
precipice
from
hence
a
leads
down
to
the
river
in
the
koura
about
one
hour
to
the
west
of
araayr
are
some
hillocks
called
keszour
el
besheir
arabic
the
view
which
the
modjeb
presents
is
very
striking
from
the
bottom
where
the
river
runs
through
a
narrow
stripe
of
verdant
level
about
forty
yards
across
the
steep
and
barren
banks
arise
to
a
great
height
covered
with
immense
blocks
of
stone
which
have
rolled
down
from
the
upper
strata
so
that
when
viewed
from
above
the
valley
looks
like
a
deep
chasm
formed
by
some
tremendous
convulsion
of
the
earth
into
which
there
seems
no
possibility
of
descending
to
the
bottom
the
distance
from
the
edge
of
one
precipice
to
that
of
the
opposite
one
is
about
two
miles
in
a
straight
line
we
descended
the
northern
bank
of
the
wady
by
a
which
winds
among
the
masses
of
rock
dismounting
on
account
of
the
steepness
of
the
road
as
we
had
been
obliged
to
do
in
the
two
former
valleys
which
we
had
passed
in
this
march
this
is
a
very
dangerous
pass
as
robbers
often
waylay
travellers
here
concealing
themselves
behind
the
rocks
until
their
prey
is
close
to
them
upon
many
large
blocks
by
the
side
of
the
path
i
saw
heaps
of
small
stones
placed
there
as
a
sort
of
weapon
for
the
traveller
in
case
of
need
no
arab
passes
without
adding
a
few
stones
to
these
heaps
there
are
three
fords
across
the
modjeb
of
which
we
took
that
most
frequented
i
had
never
felt
such
suffocating
heat
as
i
experienced
in
this
valley
from
the
concentrated
rays
of
the
sun
and
their
reflection
from
the
rocks
we
were
minutes
in
reaching
the
bottom
about
twelve
minutes
above
the
river
i
saw
on
the
road
side
a
heap
of
fragments
of
columns
which
had
been
about
eight
feet
in
height
a
bridge
has
been
thrown
across
the
stream
in
this
place
of
one
high
arch
and
well
built
but
it
is
now
no
longer
of
any
use
though
evidently
of
modern
date
at
a
short
distance
from
the
bridge
are
the
ruins
of
a
mill
the
river
which
flows
in
a
rocky
bed
was
almost
dried
up
having
less
water
than
the
zerka
mayn
and
wale
but
its
bed
bears
evident
marks
of
its
impetuosity
during
the
rainy
season
the
shattered
fragments
of
large
pieces
of
rock
which
had
been
broken
from
the
banks
nearest
the
river
and
carried
along
by
the
torrent
being
deposited
at
a
considerable
height
above
the
present
channel
of
the
stream
a
few
defle
and
willow
trees
grow
on
its
banks
the
principal
source
of
the
modjeb
is
at
a
short
distance
to
the
of
katrane
a
station
of
the
syrian
hadj
there
the
river
is
called
seyl
sayde
seyl
means
rivulet
in
this
country
arabic
lower
down
it
changes
its
name
to
efm
el
kereim
arabic
or
as
it
is
also
called
szefye
arabic
at
about
one
hour
east
of
the
bridge
it
receives
the
waters
of
the
ledjoum
which
flow
from
the
in
a
deep
bed
the
ledjoum
receives
a
rivulet
caled
seyl
el
mekhreys
arabic
and
then
the
baloua
arabic
after
which
it
takes
the
name
of
enkheyle
arabic
near
the
source
of
the
ledjoum
is
the
ruined
place
called
tedoun
arabic
and
near
the
source
of
the
baloua
is
a
small
ruined
castle
called
kalaat
baloua
the
rivulet
salyhha
arabic
coming
from
the
south
empties
itself
into
the
modjeb
below
the
bridge
near
the
confluence
of
the
ledjoum
and
the
modjeb
there
seemed
to
be
a
fine
verdant
pasture
ground
in
the
midst
of
which
stands
a
hill
with
some
ruins
upon
it
and
by
the
side
of
the
river
are
several
ruined
mills
in
mounting
the
southern
ascent
from
the
modjeb
we
passed
upon
a
narrow
level
at
about
five
minutes
from
the
bridge
the
ruins
of
a
small
castle
of
which
nothing
but
the
foundations
remains
it
is
called
mehatet
el
hadj
arabic
from
the
supposition
that
the
pilgrim
route
to
mekka
formerly
passed
here
and
that
this
was
a
station
of
the
hadj
near
the
ruin
is
a
birket
which
was
filled
by
a
canal
from
the
ledjoum
the
remains
of
which
are
still
visible
this
may
perhaps
be
the
site
of
areopolis
my
guide
told
me
that
seetzen
had
been
partly
stripped
at
this
place
by
some
arabs
we
did
not
meet
with
any
living
being
in
crossing
the
wady
near
the
ruins
is
another
heap
of
broken
columns
like
those
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
i
conjecture
that
the
columns
were
roman
milliaria
because
a
causeway
begins
here
and
runs
all
the
way
up
the
mountain
and
from
thence
as
far
as
rabba
it
is
about
fifteen
feet
broad
and
was
well
paved
though
at
present
in
a
bad
state
owing
to
a
torrent
which
rushes
along
it
from
the
mountain
in
winter
time
at
minutes
from
the
mehatet
el
hadj
are
three
similar
columns
entire
but
lying
on
the
ground
we
were
an
hour
and
three
quarters
in
ascending
from
the
bridge
to
the
top
on
this
side
the
road
might
easily
be
made
passable
for
horses
in
several
places
the
rock
has
been
cut
through
to
form
the
path
the
lower
part
of
the
mountains
is
calcareous
i
found
great
numbers
of
small
petrified
shells
and
small
pieces
of
mica
are
likewise
met
with
towards
arabs
hamaide
the
upper
part
of
the
mountain
the
ground
is
covered
with
large
blocks
of
the
black
haouran
stone
it
is
from
this
black
and
heavy
stone
which
seetzen
calls
basalt
but
which
i
rather
conceive
to
belong
to
the
species
called
tufwacke
by
the
germans
that
the
ancient
opinion
of
there
having
been
mountains
of
iron
on
the
east
side
of
the
jordan
appears
to
have
arisen
even
now
the
arabs
believe
that
these
stones
consist
chiefly
of
iron
and
i
was
often
asked
if
i
did
not
know
how
to
extract
it
which
i
found
to
be
more
porous
than
any
specimens
of
it
which
i
had
seen
further
northward
on
the
summit
of
this
steep
southern
ascent
are
the
ruins
of
a
large
square
building
of
which
the
foundations
only
remain
covered
with
heaps
of
stone
they
are
directly
opposite
araayr
and
the
ruins
above
mentioned
are
also
called
mehatet
el
hadj
i
believe
them
to
be
of
modern
date
we
had
now
again
reached
a
high
plain
to
our
right
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
was
the
djebel
shyhhan
an
insulated
mountain
with
the
ruined
village
of
that
name
on
its
summit
to
our
left
on
the
side
of
the
ledjoum
about
two
or
three
hours
distant
is
a
chain
of
low
mountains
called
el
ghoweythe
arabic
running
from
to
about
three
or
four
hours
to
the
south
of
el
ghoweythe
begins
a
chain
of
low
hills
called
el
tarfouye
arabic
which
farther
south
takes
the
name
of
orokaraye
arabic
it
then
turns
westward
and
terminates
to
the
of
kerek
from
the
mehatet
el
hadj
we
followed
the
paved
road
which
leads
in
a
straight
line
towards
rabba
in
a
direction
in
half
an
hour
we
met
some
shepherds
with
a
flock
of
sheep
who
led
us
to
the
tents
of
their
people
behind
a
hill
near
the
side
of
the
road
we
were
much
fatigued
but
the
kindness
of
our
hosts
soon
made
us
forget
our
laborious
march
we
alighted
under
the
tent
of
the
sheikh
who
was
dying
of
a
wound
he
had
received
a
few
days
before
from
a
thrust
of
a
lance
but
such
is
the
hospitality
of
these
people
and
their
attention
to
the
comforts
beit
kerm
of
the
traveller
that
we
did
not
learn
the
misfortune
till
the
following
day
he
was
in
the
apartment
and
we
did
not
hear
him
utter
any
complaints
they
supposed
with
reason
that
if
we
were
informed
of
his
situation
it
would
prevent
us
from
enjoying
our
supper
a
lamb
was
killed
and
a
friend
of
the
family
did
the
honours
of
the
table
we
should
have
enjoyed
our
repast
had
there
not
been
an
absolute
want
of
water
but
there
was
none
nearer
than
the
modjeb
and
the
daily
supply
which
according
to
the
custom
of
the
arabs
had
been
brought
in
before
was
as
often
happens
exhausted
before
night
our
own
water
skins
too
which
we
had
filled
at
the
modjeb
had
been
emptied
by
the
shepherds
before
we
reached
the
encampment
this
loss
was
the
more
sensible
to
me
as
in
desert
countries
where
water
seldom
occurs
not
feeling
great
thirst
during
the
heat
of
the
day
i
was
seldom
in
the
habit
of
drinking
much
at
that
time
but
in
the
evening
and
the
early
part
of
the
night
i
always
drank
with
great
eagerness
july
left
our
kind
hosts
who
belonged
to
the
arabs
hamaide
early
in
the
morning
and
continued
our
route
along
the
ancient
road
at
half
an
hour
from
the
encampment
we
passed
the
ruined
village
el
ryhha
arabic
in
one
hour
and
a
half
we
arrived
at
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
city
called
beit
kerm
arabic
belonging
to
which
on
the
side
of
the
road
are
the
remains
of
a
temple
of
remote
antiquity
its
shape
is
an
oblong
square
one
of
the
long
sides
forming
the
front
where
was
a
portica
of
eight
columns
in
antis
the
columns
three
feet
in
diameter
are
lying
on
the
ground
within
the
temple
a
great
part
of
the
walls
of
which
are
fallen
there
are
fragments
of
smaller
columns
the
stones
used
in
the
construction
of
the
walls
are
about
five
feet
long
and
two
feet
broad
at
one
hour
and
three
quarters
is
the
ruined
village
of
hemeymat
arabic
this
district
which
is
an
even
plain
is
kerek
very
fertile
and
large
tracts
are
here
cultivated
by
the
inhabitants
of
kerek
and
the
arabs
hamaide
at
two
hours
and
a
half
is
rabba
arabic
probably
the
ancient
rabbath
moab
where
the
ancient
causeway
terminates
the
ruins
of
rabba
are
about
half
an
hour
in
circuit
and
are
situated
upon
a
low
hill
which
commands
the
whole
plain
i
examined
a
part
of
them
only
but
the
rest
seemed
to
contain
nothing
remarkable
on
the
west
side
is
a
temple
of
which
one
wall
and
several
niches
remain
by
no
means
distinguished
for
elegance
near
them
is
a
gate
belonging
to
another
building
which
stood
on
the
edge
of
a
birket
distant
from
these
ruins
about
thirty
yards
stand
two
corinthian
columns
of
middling
size
one
higher
than
the
other
in
the
plain
to
the
west
of
the
birket
stands
an
insulated
altar
in
the
town
many
fragments
are
lying
about
the
walls
of
the
larger
edifices
are
built
like
those
of
heit
kerm
there
are
many
remains
of
private
habitations
but
none
entire
there
being
no
springs
in
this
spot
the
town
had
two
birkets
the
largest
of
which
is
cut
entirely
out
of
the
rocky
ground
together
with
several
cisterns
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
to
the
of
rabba
are
two
copious
springs
called
el
djebeyba
arabic
and
el
yaroud
arabic
from
rabba
our
road
lay
by
at
four
hours
are
the
ruins
of
kereythela
arabic
at
the
end
of
five
hours
we
entered
a
mountainous
district
full
of
wadys
and
after
a
march
of
six
hours
we
reached
the
town
of
kerek
i
hesitated
where
i
should
alight
at
kerek
and
whether
i
should
announce
myself
as
a
turk
or
a
christian
for
i
knew
that
the
success
of
my
progress
southward
depended
upon
the
good
will
of
the
people
of
this
place
i
had
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
the
sheikh
of
the
town
given
to
me
by
a
turkish
gentleman
of
damascus
whose
wife
was
a
native
of
kerek
and
he
had
mentioned
me
in
such
terms
as
led
me
to
anticipate
a
good
reception
but
as
i
knew
that
i
should
be
much
harassed
by
inquisitive
visitors
were
i
to
take
up
my
lodgings
at
the
house
i
determined
to
alight
at
some
and
then
consult
upon
my
future
proceeding
with
the
greek
priest
whom
i
knew
by
report
i
no
sooner
entered
the
north
gate
of
the
town
where
is
the
quarter
of
the
christians
than
i
was
surrounded
by
several
of
these
hospitable
people
who
took
hold
of
the
bridle
of
my
horse
every
one
insisting
upon
my
repairing
to
his
dwelling
i
followed
one
and
the
whole
neighbourhood
was
soon
assembled
to
partake
of
the
sheep
that
was
slaughtered
in
honour
of
my
arrival
still
no
one
had
asked
me
who
i
was
or
whither
i
was
going
after
some
conversation
with
the
priest
i
thought
it
expedient
to
pay
a
visit
of
ceremony
to
the
sheikh
in
order
to
deliver
my
letter
i
soon
however
had
reason
to
repent
he
received
me
very
politely
but
when
he
heard
of
my
intention
of
proceeding
southward
he
told
me
that
he
could
not
allow
of
my
going
forward
with
one
guide
only
and
that
as
he
was
preparing
to
visit
the
southern
districts
himself
in
a
few
days
i
should
wait
for
him
or
his
people
to
conduct
me
his
secretary
then
informed
me
that
it
was
expected
i
should
make
some
present
to
the
sheikh
and
pay
him
besides
the
sum
which
i
must
have
given
for
a
guide
the
present
i
flatly
refused
to
make
saying
that
it
was
rather
the
duty
to
make
a
present
to
the
guest
recommended
to
him
by
such
a
person
as
my
damascene
friend
was
with
respect
to
the
second
demand
i
answered
that
i
had
no
more
money
with
me
than
was
absolutely
necessary
for
my
journey
our
negotiations
on
this
point
lasted
for
several
days
when
seeing
that
i
could
obtain
no
guide
without
an
order
from
the
sheikh
i
at
last
agreed
to
pay
fifteen
piastres
for
his
company
as
far
as
djebel
sherah
if
i
had
shewn
a
disposition
to
pay
this
sum
immediately
every
body
would
have
thought
that
i
had
plenty
of
money
and
more
considerable
sums
would
have
been
extorted
in
every
part
of
turkey
it
is
a
prudent
rule
not
to
grant
the
turks
their
demands
immediately
because
they
soon
return
to
the
charge
had
i
not
shewn
my
letter
to
the
sheikh
i
should
have
procured
a
guide
with
little
trouble
i
should
have
had
it
in
my
power
to
see
the
borders
of
the
dead
sea
and
should
have
been
enabled
to
depart
sooner
but
having
once
made
my
agreement
with
him
i
was
obliged
to
wait
for
his
departure
which
was
put
off
from
day
to
day
and
thus
i
was
prevented
from
going
to
any
distance
from
the
town
from
the
fear
of
being
left
behind
i
remained
therefore
at
kerek
for
twenty
successive
days
changing
my
lodgings
almost
every
day
in
order
to
comply
with
the
pressing
invitations
of
its
hospitable
inhabitants
the
town
of
kerek
arabic
a
common
name
in
syria
is
built
upon
the
top
of
a
steep
hill
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
a
deep
and
narrow
valley
the
mountains
beyond
which
command
the
town
in
the
valley
on
the
west
and
north
sides
are
several
copious
springs
on
the
borders
of
which
the
inhabitants
cultivate
some
vegetables
and
considerable
plantations
of
olive
trees
the
principal
of
these
sources
are
ain
sara
arabic
which
issues
from
the
rock
in
a
very
romantic
spot
where
a
mosque
has
been
built
now
in
ruins
this
rivulet
turns
three
mills
the
other
sources
are
ain
szafszaf
arabic
ain
kobeyshe
arabic
and
ain
frandjy
arabic
or
the
european
spring
in
the
rock
near
which
as
some
persons
told
me
is
an
inscription
in
frank
characters
but
no
one
ever
would
or
could
shew
it
me
the
town
is
surrounded
by
a
wall
which
has
fallen
down
in
several
places
it
is
defended
by
six
or
seven
large
towers
of
which
the
northern
is
almost
perfect
and
has
a
long
arabic
inscription
on
its
wall
but
too
high
to
be
legible
from
the
ground
on
each
side
of
the
inscription
is
a
lion
in
similar
to
those
seen
on
the
walls
of
aleppo
and
damascus
the
town
had
originally
only
two
entrances
one
to
the
south
and
the
other
to
the
north
they
are
dark
passages
forty
paces
in
length
cut
through
the
rock
an
inscription
on
the
northern
gate
ascribes
its
formation
to
sultan
eddin
arabic
besides
these
two
gates
two
other
entrances
have
been
formed
leading
over
the
ruins
of
the
town
wall
at
the
west
end
of
the
town
stands
a
castle
on
the
edge
of
a
deep
precipice
over
the
wady
kobeysha
it
is
built
in
the
style
of
most
of
the
syrian
castles
with
thick
walls
and
parapets
large
arched
apartments
dark
passages
with
and
subterraneous
vaults
and
it
probably
owes
its
origin
like
most
of
these
castles
to
the
prudent
system
of
defence
adopted
by
the
saracens
against
the
franks
during
the
crusades
in
a
large
gothic
hall
are
the
remains
of
paintings
in
fresco
but
so
much
defaced
that
nothing
can
be
clearly
distinguished
kerek
having
been
for
some
time
in
the
hands
of
the
franks
this
hall
may
have
been
built
at
that
time
for
a
church
and
decorated
with
paintings
upon
an
uncouth
figure
of
a
man
bearing
a
large
chain
i
read
the
letters
ioni
painted
in
large
characters
the
rest
of
the
inscription
was
effaced
on
the
side
towards
the
town
the
castle
is
defended
by
a
deep
fosse
cut
in
the
rock
near
which
are
seen
several
remains
of
columns
of
gray
and
red
granite
on
the
south
side
the
castle
hill
is
faced
with
stone
in
the
same
manner
as
at
aleppo
el
hossn
szalkhat
on
the
west
side
a
wall
has
been
thrown
across
the
wady
to
some
high
rocks
which
project
from
the
opposite
side
a
kind
of
birket
has
thus
been
formed
which
formerly
supplied
the
garrison
with
water
in
the
castle
is
a
deep
well
and
many
of
the
private
houses
also
have
wells
but
their
water
is
brackish
others
have
cisterns
which
save
the
inhabitants
the
trouble
of
fetching
their
water
from
the
wady
below
there
are
no
antiquities
in
the
town
excepting
a
few
fragments
of
granite
columns
a
good
mosque
built
by
melek
el
dhaher
is
now
in
ruins
the
christians
have
a
church
dedicated
to
george
or
el
khuder
which
has
been
lately
repaired
on
the
declivity
of
the
wady
to
the
south
of
the
town
are
some
ancient
sepulchral
caves
of
coarse
workmanship
cut
in
the
chalky
rock
kerek
is
inhabited
by
about
four
hundred
turkish
and
one
hundred
and
fifty
christian
families
the
former
can
furnish
upwards
of
eight
hundred
firelocks
the
latter
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
the
turks
are
composed
of
settlers
from
all
parts
of
southern
syria
but
principally
from
the
mountains
about
hebron
and
nablous
the
christians
are
for
the
greater
part
descendants
of
refugees
from
jerusalem
bethlehem
and
beit
djade
they
are
free
from
all
exactions
and
enjoy
the
same
rights
with
the
turks
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
kerek
was
in
the
hands
of
the
bedouin
tribe
called
beni
ammer
who
were
accustomed
to
encamp
around
the
town
and
to
torment
the
inhabitants
with
their
extortions
it
may
be
remarked
generally
of
the
bedouins
that
wherever
they
are
the
masters
of
the
cultivators
the
latter
are
soon
reduced
to
beggary
by
their
unceasing
demands
the
uncle
of
the
present
sheikh
of
kerek
who
was
then
head
of
the
town
exasperated
at
their
conduct
came
to
an
understanding
with
the
arabs
howeytat
and
in
junction
with
these
falling
suddenly
upon
the
beni
ammer
completely
defeated
them
in
two
encounters
the
ammer
were
obliged
to
take
refuge
in
the
belka
where
they
joined
the
adouan
but
were
again
driven
from
thence
and
obliged
to
fly
towards
jerusalem
for
many
years
afterwards
they
led
a
miserable
life
from
not
being
sufficiently
strong
to
secure
to
their
cattle
good
pasturing
places
about
six
years
ago
they
determined
to
return
to
kerek
whatever
might
be
their
fate
in
their
way
round
the
southern
extremity
of
the
dead
sea
they
lost
two
thirds
of
their
cattle
by
the
attacks
of
their
inveterate
enemies
the
terabein
when
at
last
they
arrived
in
the
neighbourhood
of
kerek
they
threw
themselves
upon
the
mercy
of
the
present
sheikh
of
the
town
youssef
medjaby
who
granted
them
permission
to
remain
in
his
district
provided
they
would
obey
his
commands
they
were
now
reduced
from
upwards
of
one
thousand
tents
to
about
two
hundred
and
they
may
at
present
be
considered
as
the
advanced
guard
of
the
sheikh
of
kerek
who
employs
them
against
his
own
enemies
and
makes
them
encamp
wherever
he
thinks
proper
the
inhabitants
of
kerek
have
thus
become
formidable
to
all
the
neighbouring
arabs
they
are
complete
masters
of
the
district
of
kerek
and
have
great
influence
over
the
affairs
of
the
belka
the
christians
of
kerek
are
renowned
for
their
courage
and
more
especially
so
since
an
action
which
lately
took
place
between
them
and
the
rowalla
a
tribe
of
aeneze
a
party
of
the
latter
had
on
a
sunday
when
the
men
were
absent
robbed
the
christian
encampment
which
was
at
about
an
hour
from
the
town
of
all
its
cattle
on
the
first
alarm
given
by
the
women
young
men
immediately
pursued
the
enemy
whom
they
overtook
at
a
short
distance
and
had
the
courage
to
attack
though
upwards
of
four
hundred
men
mounted
on
camels
and
many
of
them
armed
with
firelocks
after
a
battle
of
two
hours
the
rowalla
gave
way
with
the
loss
of
killed
a
great
many
wounded
and
one
hundred
and
twenty
camels
together
with
the
whole
booty
which
they
had
carried
off
the
christians
had
only
four
men
killed
to
account
for
the
success
of
this
heroic
enterprise
i
must
mention
that
the
people
of
kerek
are
excellent
marksmen
there
is
not
a
boy
among
them
who
does
not
know
how
to
use
a
firelock
by
the
time
he
is
ten
years
of
age
the
sheikh
of
kerek
has
no
greater
authority
over
his
people
than
a
bedouin
sheikh
has
over
his
tribe
in
every
thing
which
regards
the
bedouins
he
governs
with
the
advice
of
the
most
respectable
individuals
of
the
town
and
his
power
is
not
absolute
enough
to
deprive
the
meanest
of
his
subjects
of
the
smallest
part
that
prevails
prevents
the
increase
of
wealth
and
the
richest
man
in
the
town
is
not
worth
more
than
about
sterling
their
custom
of
entertaining
strangers
is
much
the
same
as
at
szalt
they
have
eight
menzels
or
medhafe
arabic
for
the
reception
of
guests
six
of
which
belong
to
the
turks
and
two
to
the
christians
their
expenses
are
not
defrayed
by
a
common
purse
but
whenever
a
stranger
takes
up
his
lodging
at
one
of
the
medhafes
one
of
the
people
present
declares
that
he
intends
to
furnish
that
entertainment
and
it
is
then
his
duty
to
provide
a
dinner
or
supper
which
he
sends
to
the
medhafe
and
which
is
always
in
sufficient
quantity
for
a
large
company
a
goat
or
a
lamb
is
generally
killed
on
the
occasion
and
barley
for
the
horse
is
also
furnished
when
a
stranger
enters
the
town
the
people
almost
come
to
blows
with
one
another
in
their
eagerness
to
have
him
for
their
guest
and
there
are
turks
who
every
other
day
kill
a
goat
for
this
hospitable
purpose
indeed
it
is
a
custom
here
even
with
respect
to
their
own
neighbours
that
whenever
a
visitor
enters
a
house
dinner
or
supper
is
to
be
immediately
set
before
him
their
love
of
entertaining
strangers
is
carried
to
such
a
length
that
not
long
ago
when
a
christian
silversmith
who
came
from
jerusalem
to
work
for
the
ladies
and
who
being
an
industrious
man
seldom
stirred
out
of
his
shop
was
on
the
point
of
departure
after
a
two
months
residence
each
of
the
principal
families
of
the
town
sent
him
a
lamb
saying
that
it
was
not
just
that
he
should
lose
his
due
though
he
did
not
choose
to
come
and
dine
with
them
the
more
a
man
expends
upon
his
guests
the
greater
is
his
reputation
and
influence
and
the
few
families
who
pursue
an
opposite
conduct
are
despised
by
all
the
others
kerek
is
filled
with
guests
every
evening
for
the
bedouins
knowing
that
they
are
here
sure
of
a
good
supper
for
themselves
and
their
horses
visit
it
as
often
as
they
can
they
alight
at
one
medhafe
go
the
next
morning
to
another
and
often
visit
the
whole
before
they
depart
the
following
remarkable
custom
furnishes
another
example
of
their
hospitable
manners
it
is
considered
at
kerek
an
unpardonable
meanness
to
sell
butter
or
to
exchange
it
for
any
necessary
or
convenience
of
life
so
that
as
the
property
of
the
people
chiefly
consists
in
cattle
and
every
family
possesses
large
flocks
of
goats
and
sheep
which
produce
great
quantities
of
butter
they
supply
this
article
very
liberally
to
their
guests
besides
other
modes
of
consuming
butter
in
their
cookery
the
most
common
dish
at
breakfast
or
dinner
is
fetyte
a
sort
of
pudding
made
with
sour
milk
and
a
large
quantity
of
butter
there
are
families
who
thus
consume
in
the
course
of
a
year
upwards
of
ten
quintals
of
butter
if
a
man
is
known
to
have
sold
or
exchanged
this
article
his
daughters
or
sisters
remain
unmarried
for
no
one
would
dare
to
connect
himself
with
the
family
of
a
baya
el
samin
arabic
or
seller
of
butter
the
most
insulting
epithet
that
can
be
applied
to
a
man
of
kerek
this
custom
is
peculiar
to
the
place
and
unknown
to
the
bedouins
the
people
of
kerek
intermarry
with
the
bedouins
and
the
aeneze
even
give
the
kerekein
their
girls
in
marriage
the
sum
paid
to
the
father
of
the
bride
is
generally
between
six
and
eighthundred
piastres
young
men
without
property
are
obliged
to
serve
the
father
five
or
six
years
as
menial
servants
in
compensation
for
the
price
of
the
girl
the
kerekein
do
not
treat
their
wives
so
affectionately
as
the
bedouins
if
one
of
them
falls
sick
and
her
sickness
is
likely
to
prevent
her
for
some
time
from
taking
care
of
the
family
affairs
the
husband
sends
her
back
to
her
house
with
a
message
that
must
cure
her
for
as
he
says
bought
a
healthy
wife
of
you
and
it
is
not
just
that
i
should
be
at
the
trouble
and
expense
of
curing
this
is
a
rule
with
both
mohammedans
and
christians
it
is
not
the
custom
for
the
husband
to
buy
clothes
or
articles
of
dress
for
his
wife
she
is
in
consequence
obliged
to
apply
to
her
own
family
in
order
to
appear
decently
in
public
or
to
rob
her
husband
of
his
wheal
and
barley
and
sell
it
clandestinely
in
small
quantities
nor
does
she
inherit
the
smallest
trifle
of
her
property
the
kerekein
never
sleep
under
the
same
blanket
with
their
wives
and
to
be
accused
of
doing
so
is
considered
as
great
an
insult
as
to
be
called
a
coward
the
domestic
manners
of
the
christians
of
kerek
are
the
same
as
those
of
the
turks
their
laws
are
also
the
same
excepting
those
relating
to
marriage
and
in
cases
of
litigation
even
amongst
themselves
they
repair
to
the
tribunal
of
the
kadhy
or
judge
of
the
town
instead
of
submitting
their
differences
to
their
own
sheikhs
the
kadhy
is
elected
by
the
sheikhs
with
respect
to
their
religious
duties
they
observe
them
much
less
than
any
other
greeks
in
syria
few
of
them
frequent
the
church
alleging
not
without
reason
that
it
is
of
no
use
to
them
because
they
do
not
understand
one
word
of
the
greek
forms
of
prayer
neither
are
they
rigid
observers
of
lent
which
is
natural
enough
as
they
would
be
obliged
to
live
almost
entirely
on
dry
bread
were
they
to
abstain
wholly
from
animal
food
though
so
intimately
united
with
the
turks
both
by
common
interests
and
manners
as
to
be
considered
the
same
tribe
yet
there
exists
much
jealousy
among
the
adherents
of
the
two
religions
which
is
farther
increased
by
the
predilection
for
the
christians
the
turks
seeing
that
the
latter
prosper
have
devised
a
curious
method
of
participating
in
the
favours
which
providence
may
bestow
on
the
christians
on
account
of
their
religion
many
of
them
baptise
their
male
children
in
the
church
of
george
and
take
christian
godfathers
for
their
sons
there
is
neither
mollah
nor
fanatic
kadhy
to
prevent
this
practice
and
the
greek
priest
who
is
handsomely
paid
for
baptising
reconciles
his
conscientious
scruples
by
the
hope
that
the
boy
so
baptized
may
perhaps
die
a
christian
added
to
this
he
does
not
give
the
child
entire
baptism
but
dips
the
hands
and
feet
only
in
the
water
while
the
christian
child
receives
total
immersion
and
this
pious
fraud
sets
all
his
doubts
at
rest
as
to
the
legality
of
the
act
the
priests
pretend
nevertheless
that
such
is
the
efficacy
of
the
baptism
that
these
baptised
turks
have
never
been
known
to
die
otherwise
than
by
old
age
kerek
is
the
see
of
a
greek
bishop
who
generally
resides
at
jerusalem
the
diocese

called
battra
arabic
in
arabic
and
greek
in
greek
and
it
is
the
general
opinion
among
the
clergy
of
jerusalem
that
kerek
is
the
ancient

the
greek
bishops
belonging
to
the

but
it
will
be

that
there
is

to
think
they
are

the

about
six

per

he
visits
his
diocese
every
five
or
six
years
during
my
stay
a
greek
priest
arrived
from
jerusalem
to
collect
for
his
convent
which
had
been
at
a
great
expense
in
rebuilding
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
the
greeks
delivered
to
him
in
sheep
to
the
value
of
about
fifteen
pounds
sterling
the
kerekein
cultivate
the
plains
in
the
neighbouring
mountains
and
feed
their
cattle
on
the
uncultivated
parts
of
the
people
remain
encamped
the
whole
year
at
two
or
three
hours
distant
from
the
town
to
superintend
the
cattle
the
rest
encamp
in
the
harvest
time
only
during
the
latter
period
the
christians
have
two
large
camps
or
douars
and
the
turks
five
here
they
live
like
bedouins
whom
they
exactly
resemble
in
dress
food
and
language
the
produce
of
their
fields
is
purchased
by
the
bedouins
or
exchanged
for
cattle
the
only
other
commercial
intercourse
carried
on
by
them
is
with
jerusalem
for
which
place
a
caravan
departs
every
two
months
travelling
either
by
the
route
round
the
southern
extremity
of
the
dead
sea
which
takes
three
days
and
a
half
or
by
crossing
the
jordan
a
journey
of
three
days
at
jerusalem
they
sell
their
sheep
and
goats
a
few
mules
of
which
they
have
an
excellent
breed
hides
wool
and
a
little
fowa
or
madder
rubia
tinctorum
which
they
cultivate
in
small
quantities
in
return
they
take
coffee
rice
tobacco
and
all
kinds
of
articles
of
dress
and
of
household
furniture
this
journey
however
is
undertaken
by
few
of
the
natives
of
kerek
the
trade
being
almost
wholly
in
the
hands
of
a
few
merchants
of
hebron
who
keep
shops
at
kerek
and
thus
derive
large
profits
from
the
indolence
or
ignorance
of
the
kerekein
i
have
seen
the
most
common
articles
sold
at
two
hundred
per
cent
profit
the
trade
is
carried
on
chiefly
by
barter
and
every
thing
is
valued
in
measures
of
corn
this
being
the
readiest
representative
of
exchange
in
the
possession
of
the
hence
the
merchants
make
their
returns
chiefly
in
corn
and
partly
in
wool
the
only
artizans
in
kerek
who
keep
shops
are
a
blacksmith
a
shoemaker
and
a
silversmith
when
the
mekka
caravan
passes
the
kerekein
sell
provisions
of
all
kinds
to
the
hadj
which
they
meet
at
the
castle
of
katrana
many
turks
as
well
as
christians
in
the
town
have
negro
slaves
whom
they
buy
from
the
bedouins
who
bring
them
from
djidda
and
mekka
there
are
also
several
families
of
blacks
in
kerek
who
have
obtained
their
liberty
and
have
married
free
black
women
the
houses
of
kerek
have
only
one
floor
and
three
or
four
are
generally
built
in
the
same
the
roof
of
the
apartment
is
supported
by
two
arches
much
in
the
same
way
as
in
the
ancient
buildings
of
the
haouran
which
latter
however
have
generally
but
one
arch
over
the
arches
thick
branches
of
trees
are
laid
and
over
the
latter
a
thin
layer
of
rushes
along
the
wall
at
the
extremity
of
the
room
opposite
to
the
entrance
are
large
earthen
reservoirs
of
wheat
kowari
arabic
there
is
generally
no
other
aperture
in
these
rooms
than
the
door
a
circumstance
that
renders
them
excessively
disagreeable
in
the
winter
evenings
when
the
door
is
shut
and
a
large
fire
is
kindled
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
some
of
the
arab
tribes
in
the
territory
of
kerek
pay
a
small
annual
tribute
to
the
sheikh
of
kerek
as
do
likewise
the
peasants
who
cultivate
the
shores
of
the
dead
sea
in
order
however
to
secure
their
harvests
against
any
casualties
the
kerekein
have
deemed
it
expedient
to
pay
on
their
part
a
tribute
to
the
southern
arabs
called
el
howeytat
who
are
continually
passing
this
way
in
their
expeditions
against
the
beni
szakher
the
christians
pay
to
one
of
the
howeytat
sheikhs
one
spanish
dollar
per
family
and
the
turks
send
them
annually
about
fifteen
mule
loads
of
carpets
which
are
manufacured
at
kerek
whenever
the
sheikhs
of
the
beni
szakher
visit
the
town
they
receive
considerable
presents
by
way
of
a
friendly
tribute
the
district
of
kerek
comprises
three
other
villages
which
are
under
the
orders
of
the
sheikh
of
kerek
viz
ketherabba
arabic
oerak
arabic
and
khanzyre

there
are
besides
a
great
number
of

from

not
having
had
an
opportunity
of
descending
to
the
borders
of
the
dead
sea
i
shall
subjoin
here
a
few
notes
which
i
collected
from
the
people
of
kerek
i
have
since
been
informed
that
seetzen
the
most
indefatigable
traveller
that
ever
visited
syria
has
made
the
complete
tour
of
the
dead
sea
i
doubt
not
that
he
has
made
many
interesting
discoveries
in
natural
history
the
mountains
which
inclose
the
ghor
or
valley
of
the
jordan
open
considerably
at
the
northern
extremity
of
the
dead
sea
and
encompassing
it
on
the
and
sides
approach
again
at
its
extremity
leaving
only
a
narrow
plain
between
them
the
plain
on
the
west
side
between
the
sea
and
the
mountains
is
covered
with
sand
and
is
unfit
for
cultivation
but
on
the
side
and
especially
towards
the
extremity
where
it
continues
to
bear
the
appellation
of
el
ghor
arabic
the
plain
is
in
many
places
very
fertile
its
breadth
varies
from
one
to
four
and
five
miles
it
is
covered
with
forests
in
the
midst
of
which
the
miserable
peasants
build
their
huts
of
rushes
and
cultivate
their
dhourra
and
tobacco
fields
these
peasants
are
called
el
ghowárene
arabic
and
amount
to
about
three
hundred
families
they
live
very
poorly
owing
to
the
continual
exactions
of
the
neighbouring
bedouins
who
descend
in
winter
from
the
mountains
of
belka
and
kerek
and
pasture
their
cattle
amidst
the
fields
the
heat
of
the
climate
of
this
low
valley
during
the
summer
renders
it
almost
uninhabitable
the
people
then
go
nearly
naked
but
their
low
huts
instead
of
affording
shelter
from
the
heat
rather
increase
it
at
this
period
violent
intermittent
fevers
prevail
to
which
however
they
are
so
much
accustomed
that
they
labour
in
the
fields
during
the
intervals
of
the
paroxysms
of
the
disease
the
principal
settlement
of
the
ghowárene
is
at
the
southern
extremity
of
the
sea
near
the
embouchure
of
the
wady
el
ahhsa
their
village
is
called
ghor
szafye
arabic
and
is
the
winter
rendezvous
of
more
than
ten
large
tribes
of
bedouins
its
situation
corresponds
with
that
of
zoar
the
spots
not
cultivated
being
for
the
greater
part
sandy
there
is
little
pasturage
and
the
camels
in
consequence
feed
principally
upon
the
leaves
of
the
trees
about
eight
hours
to
the
of
szafye
is
the
ghor
el
mezra
arabic
a
village
much
frequented
by
the
people
of
kerek
who
there
buy
the
tobacco
which
they
smoak
about
the
middle
of
the
lake
on
the
same
eastern
shore
are
some
ruins
of
an
ancient
city
called
towahein
el
sukkar
arabic
the
sugar
mills
farther
north
the
mountains
run
down
to
the
lake
and
a
steep
cliff
overhangs
the
sea
for
about
an
hour
shutting
out
all
passage
along
the
shore
still
farther
to
the
north
are
the
ruined
places
called
kafreyn
arabic
and
rama
arabic
and
in
the
valley
of
the
jordan
south
of
abou
obeida
are
the
ruins
of
nemrin
arabic
probably
productions
of
the
ghor
the
bethnimra
of
the
scriptures
in
the
vegetable
productions
of
this
plain
the
botanist
would
perhaps
discover
several
unknown
species
of
trees
and
plants
the
reports
of
the
arabs
on
this
subject
are
so
vague
and
incoherent
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
obtain
any
precise
information
from
them
they
speak
for
instance
of
the
spurious
pomegranate
tree
producing
a
fruit
exactly
like
that
of
the
pomegranate
but
which
on
being
opened
is
found
to
contain
nothing
but
a
dusty
powder
this
they
pretend
is
the
sodom
other
persons
however
deny
its
existence
the
tree
asheyr
arabic
is
very
common
in
the
ghor
it
bears
a
fruit
of
a
reddish
yellow
colour
about
three
inches
in
diameter
which
contains
a
white
substance
resembling
the
finest
silk
and
enveloping
some
seeds
the
arabs
collect
the
silk
and
twist
it
into
matches
for
their
preferring
it
to
the
common
match
because
it
ignites
more
readily
more
than
twenty
camel
loads
might
be
annually
procured
and
it
might
perhaps
be
found
useful
in
the
silk
and
cotton
manufactories
of
europe
at
present
the
greater
part
of
the
fruit
rots
on
the
trees
on
making
an
incision
into
the
thick
branches
of
the
asheyr
a
white
juice
exsudes
which
is
collected
by
putting
a
hollow
reed
into
the
incision
the
arabs
sell
the
juice
to
the
druggists
at
jerusalem
who
are
said
to
use
it
in
medicine
as
a
strong
cathartic
it
is
the
same
plant
called
oshour
by
the
people
of
upper
egypt
and
nubia
norden
who
has
given
a
drawing
of
it
as
found
by
him
near
the
first
cataract
of
the
nile
improperly
denominates
it
oshar
indigo
is
a
very
common
production
of
the
ghor
the
ghowárene
sell
it
to
the
merchants
of
jerusalem
and
hebron
where
it
is
worth
twenty
per
cent
more
than
egyptian
indigo
one
of
the
most
interesting
productions
of
this
valley
is
the
beyrouk
honey
or
as
the
arabs
call
it
assal
beyrouk
arabic
i
suppose
it
to
be
the
manna
but
i
never
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
it
myself
it
was
described
to
me
as
a
juice
dropping
from
the
leaves
and
twigs
of
a
tree
called
gharrab
arabic
of
the
size
of
an
olive
tree
with
leaves
like
those
of
the
poplar
but
somewhat
broader
the
honey
collects
upon
the
leaves
like
dew
and
is
gathered
from
them
or
from
the
ground
under
the
tree
which
is
often
found
completely
covered
with
it
according
to
some
its
colour
is
brownish
others
said
it
was
of
a
grayish
hue
it
is
very
sweet
when
fresh
but
turns
sour
after
being
kept
two
days
the
arabs
eat
it
like
honey
with
butter
they
also
put
it
into
their
gruel
and
use
it
in
rubbing
their
water
skins
in
order
to
exclude
the
air
i
enquired
whether
it
was
a
laxative
but
was
answered
in
the
negative
the
beyrouk
honey
is
collected
only
in
the
months
of
may
and
june
some
persons
assured
me
that
the
same
substance
was
likewise
produced
by
the
thorny
tree
tereshresh
arabic
and
collected
at
the
same
time
as
that
from
the
gharrab
in
the
mountains
of
shera
grows
a
tree
called
arar
arabic
from
the
fruit
of
which
the
bedouins
extract
a
juice
which
is
extremely
nutritive
the
tree
talh
arabic
which
produces
the
gum
arabic
arabic
is
very
common
in
the
ghor
but
the
arabs
do
not
take
the
trouble
to
collect
the
gum
among
other
vegetable
productions
there
is
a
species
of
tobacco
called
merdiny
arabic
which
has
a
most
disagreeable
taste
but
for
want
of
a
better
kind
it
is
cultivated
in
great
quantity
and
all
the
bedouins
on
the
borders
of
the
dead
sea
are
supplied
with
it
the
coloquintida
arabic
or
arabic
grows
wild
every
where
in
great
quantities
the
tree
szadder
arabic
which
is
a
species
of
the
cochineal
tree
is
also
very
common
as
to
the
mineral
productions
of
the
borders
of
the
dead
sea
it
appears
that
the
southern
mountains
are
full
of
rock
salt
which
is
washed
off
by
the
winter
rains
and
carried
down
into
the
lake
in
the
northern
ghor
pieces
of
native
sulphur
are
found
at
a
small
dead
sea
depth
beneath
the
surface
and
are
used
by
the
arabs
to
cure
diseases
in
their
camels
the
asphaltum
arabic
hommar
which
is
collected
by
the
arabs
of
the
western
shore
is
said
to
come
from
a
mountain
which
blocks
up
the
passage
along
the
eastern
ghor
and
which
is
situated
at
about
two
hours
south
of
wady
modjeb
the
arabs
pretend
that
it
oozes
from
the
fissures
in
the
cliff
and
collects
in
large
pieces
on
the
rock
below
where
the
mass
gradually
increases
and
hardens
until
it
is
rent
asunder
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
with
a
loud
explosion
and
falling
into
the
sea
is
carried
by
the
waves
in
considerable
quantities
to
the
opposite
shores
at
the
northern
extremity
of
the
sea
the
is
found
its
combustible
properties
are
ascribed
by
the
arabs
to
the
magic
rod
of
moses
whose
tomb
is
not
far
from
thence
the
stones
are
thrown
into
the
fires
made
of
dung
to
encrease
the
heat
concerning
the
lake
itself
i
was
informed
that
no
visible
increase
of
its
waters
takes
place
in
winter
time
as
the
greater
part
of
the
torrents
which
descend
from
the
eastern
mountains
do
not
reach
the
lake
but
are
lost
in
the
sandy
plain
about
three
hours
north
of
szaffye
is
a
ford
by
which
the
lake
is
crossed
in
three
hours
and
a
half
some
arabs
assured
me
that
there
are
spots
in
this
ford
where
the
water
is
quite
hot
and
where
the
bottom
is
of
red
earth
it
is
probable
that
there
are
hot
springs
in
the
bottom
of
the
lake
which
near
the
ford
is
nowhere
deeper
than
three
or
four
feet
and
generally
only
two
feet
the
water
is
so
strongly
impregnated
with
salt

a

hour
and
a
quarter
we
came
to

a
village
of
the

size
as

very
picturesquely
situated
it
is
built
at
the
foot
of

high
perpendicular
cliff
down
which
a
rivulet
rushes
into

many
immense
fragments
have
separated
from

amongst

the

its

cultivate

which
they
sell

advantage
we
rested
here
the
greater
part
of
the
day
under
a
large
kharnoub
tree
our
sheikh
had
no
pressing
business
but
like
all
arabs
fond
of
idleness
and
of
living
well
at
other
expense
he
by
no
means
hastened
his
journey
but
easily
found
a
pretext
for
stopping
wherever
we
alighted
a
couple
of
sheep
or
goats
were
immediately
killed
and
the
best
fruits
together
with
plenty
of
tobacco
were
presented
to
us
our
company
increased
at
every
village
as
all
those
arabs
who
had
horses
followed
us
in
order
to
partake
of
our
good
fare
so

here
we
stopped

our
sheikh
having
a
house
in
the
village
and
a
wife
whom
he
dared
not
carry
to
kerek
having
another
family
there
in
the
evening
he
held
a
court
of
justice
as
he
had
done
at
ketherabba
and
decided
a
number
of
disputes
between
the
peasants
the
greater
part
of

were
concerning
money
transactions
between
husbands
and

an
extensive
tract

the
villages
of
this
country
are
each
governed
by
its
own
sheikh
and
the
peasants
are
little
better
than
bedouins
their
manners
dress
and
mode
of
living
are
exactly
the
same
in
the
harvest
time
they
live
in
the
mountains
under
tents
and
their
cattle
is
entrusted
during
the
whole
year
to
a
small
encampment
of
their
own
shepherds
in
the
afternoon
of
this
day
we
were
alarmed
by
loud
cries
in
the
direction
of
the
opposite
mountain
the
whole
of
our
party
immediately
mounted
and
i
also
followed
on
reaching
the
spot
from
whence
the
cries
came
we
found
two
shepherds
of
khanzyre
quite
naked
they
had
been
stripped
by
a
party
of
the
arabs
terabein
who
live
in
the
mountains
of
hebron
and
each
of
the
robbers
had
carried
off
a
fat
sheep
upon
his
mare
they
were
now
too
far
off
to
be
overtaken
and
our
people
not
being
able
to
engage
the
enemy
amused
themselves
with
a
in
their
return
home
they
displayed
superior
strength
and
agility
in
handling
the
lance
and
great
boldness
in
riding
at
full
speed
over
rugged
and
rocky
ground
in
the
exercise
with
the
lance
the
rider
endeavours
to
put
the
point
of
it
upon
the
shoulder
of
his
adversary
thus
showing
that
his
life
is
in
his
power
when
the
parties
become
heated
they
often
bear
off
upon
their
lances
the
turbands
of
their
adversaries
and
carry
them
about
with
insolent
vociferation
our
sheikh
of
kerek
a
man
of
sixty
far
excelled
all
his
people
in
these
youthful
exercises
indeed
he
seemed
to
be
an
accomplished
bedouin
sheikh
though
he
proved
to
be
a
treacherous
friend
to
me
as
i
thought
that
i
had
settled
matters
with
him
to
his
entire
satisfaction
i
was
not
a
little
astonished
when
he
took
me
aside
in
the
evening
to
announce
to
me
that
unless
he
received
twenty
piastres
more
he
would
not
take
charge
of
me
any
farther
although
i
knew
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
hinder
me
from
following
him
and
that
he
could
not
proceed
to
violence
without
entirely
losing
his
reputation
among
the
arabs
for
his
guest
yet
i
had
acquired
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
character
to
be
persuaded
that
if
i
did
not
acquiesce
in
his
demand
he
would
devise
some
means
to
get
me
into
a
situation
which
it
would
have
perhaps
cost
me
double
the
sum
to
escape
from
i
therefore
began
to
bargain
with
him
and
brought
him
down
to
fifteen
piastres
i
then
endeavoured
to
bind
him
by
the
most
solemn
oath
used
by
the
bedouins
laying
his
hand
upon
the
head
of
his
little
boy
and
on
the
fore
feet
of
his
mare
he
swore
that
he
would
for
that
sum
conduct
me
himself
or
cause
me
to
be
conducted
to
the
arabs
howeytat
from
whence
i
might
hope
to
find
a
mode
of
proceeding
in
safety
to
egypt
my
precautions
however
were
all
in
vain
being
satisfied
that
my
cash
was
reduced
to
a
few
piastres
he
began
his
plans
for
stripping
me
of
every
other
part
of
my
property
which
had
excited
his
wishes
the
day
after
his
oath
when
we
were
about
to
depart
from
ayme
he
addressed
me
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
company
saying
that
his
saddle
would
fit
my
horse
better
than
my
own
did
and
that
he
would
therefore
change
saddles
with
me
mine
was
worth
nearly
forty
piastres
his
was
not
worth
more
than
ten
i
objected
to
the
exchange
pretending
that
i
was
not
accustomed
to
ride
upon
the
low
bedouin
saddle
he
replied
by
assuring
me
that
i
should
soon
find
it
much
more
agreeable
than
the
town
saddle
moreover
said
he
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
the
sheikh
of
the
howeytat
will
take
your
saddle
from
you
if
you
do
not
give
it
to
me
i
did
not
dare
to
put
the
sheikh
in
mind
of
his
oath
for
had
i
betrayed
to
the
company
his
having
extorted
from
me
so
much
merely
for
the
sake
of
his
company
he
would
certainly
have
been
severely
reprimanded
by
the
bedouins
present
and
i
should
thus
have
exposed
myself
to
the
effects
of
his
revenge
all
the
at
the
same
time
pressed
me
to
comply
with
his
request
he
not
your
brother
said
they
not
the
best
morsels
of
his
dish
always
for
you
does
he
not
continually
fill
your
pipe
with
his
own
tobacco
fie
upon
your
but
they
did
not
know
that
i
had
calculated
upon
paying
part
of
the
hire
of
a
guide
to
egypt
with
the
value
of
the
saddle
nor
that
i
had
already
handsomely
paid
for
my
brotherhood
i
at
last
reluctantly
complied
but
the
sheikh
was
not
yet
satisfied
the
stirrups
he
had
given
me
although
much
inferior
to
those
he
had
taken
from
me
were
too
good
in
his
eyes
to
form
part
of
my
equipment
in
the
evening
his
son
came
to
me
to
propose
an
exchange
of
these
stirrups
against
a
pair
of
his
own
almost
unfit
for
use
and
which
i
knew
would
wound
my
ankles
as
i
did
not
wear
boots
but
it
was
in
vain
to
resist
the
pressing
intreaties
of
all
my
companions
in
favour
of
the
son
lasted
for
two
whole
days
until
tired
at
length
with
their
importunity
i
yielded
and
as
had
expected
my
feet
were
soon
wounded
i
have
entered
into
these
details
in
order
to
shew
what
arab
cupidity
is
an
article
of
dress
or
of
equipment
which
the
poorest
townsman
would
be
ashamed
to
wear
is
still
a
covetable
object
with
the
bedouins
they
set
no
bounds
to
their
demands
delicacy
is
unknown
amongst
them
nor
have
they
any
word
to
express
it
if
indeed
one
persists
in
refusing
they
never
take
the
thing
by
force
but
it
is
extremely
wady
el
ahsa
difficult
to
resist
their
eternal
supplications
and
compliments
without
yielding
at
last
with
regard
to
my
behaviour
towards
the
bedouins
i
always
endeavoured
by
every
possible
means
to
be
upon
good
terms
with
my
companions
whoever
they
were
and
i
seldom
failed
in
my
endeavours
i
found
by
experience
that
putting
on
a
grave
face
and
talking
wisely
among
them
was
little
calculated
to
further
the
views
on
the
contrary
i
aspired
to
the
title
of
a
merry
fellow
i
joked
with
them
whenever
i
could
and
found
that
by
a
little
attention
to
their
ways
of
thinking
and
reasoning
they
are
easily
put
into
good
humour
this
kind
of
behaviour
however
is
to
be
observed
only
in
places
where
one
makes
a
stay
of
several
days
or
towards
fellow
travellers
in
passing
rapidly
through
arab
encampments
it
is
better
for
the
traveller
not
to
be
too
talkative
in
the
tents
where
he
alights
but
to
put
on
a
stern
countenance
we
left
khanzyre
late
in
the
evening
that
we
might
enjoy
the
coolness
of
the
night
air
we
ascended
for
a
short
time
and
then
began
to
descend
into
the
valley
called
wady
el
ahsa
it
had
now
become
dark
and
this
was
without
exception
the
most
dangerous
route
i
ever
travelled
in
my
life
the
descent
is
steep
and
there
is
no
regular
road
over
the
smooth
rocks
where
the
foot
slips
at
every
step
we
had
missed
our
way
and
were
obliged
to
alight
from
our
horses
after
many
of
us
had
suffered
severe
falls
our
sheikh
was
the
only
horseman
who
would
not
alight
from
his
mare
whose
step
he
declared
was
as
secure
as
his
own
after
a
march
of
two
hours
and
a
half
we
halted
upon
a
narrow
plain
on
the
declivity
of
the
wady
called
el
derredje
arabic
where
we
lighted
a
fire
and
remained
till
august
three
quarters
of
an
hour
from
derredje
we
reached
the
bottom
of
the
valley
the
wady
el
ahsa
arabic
which
takes
its
rise
near
the
castle
el
ahsa
or
el
hassa
on
the
el
kerr
syrian
hadj
road
runs
here
in
a
deep
and
narrow
bed
of
rocks
the
banks
of
which
are
overgrown
with
defle
there
was
more
water
in
the
rivulet
than
in
any
of
those
i
had
passed
south
of
zerka
the
water
was
quite
tepid
caused
by
a
hot
spring
which
empties
itself
into
the
ahsa
from
a
side
valley
higher
up
the
wady
this
forms
the
third
hot
spring
on
the
east
of
the
dead
sea
one
being
in
the
wady
zerka
mayn
and
another
in
the
wady
hammad
the
valley
of
el
ahsa
divides
the
district
of
kerek
from
that
of
djebal
plur
of
djebel
the
ancient
gebalene
in
the
ghor
the
river
changes
its
name
into
that
of
kerahy
arabic
and
is
likewise
called
szafye
arabic
this
name
is
found
in
all
the
maps
of
arabia
petræa
but
the
course
of
the
river
is
not
from
the
south
as
there
laid
down
djebal
also
instead
of
being
laid
down
at
the
extremity
of
the
lake
is
improperly
placed
as
beginning
on
the
of
it
the
rock
of
the
wady
el
ahsa
is
chiefly
which
is
seldom
met
with
to
the
of
this
valley
but
it
is
very
common
in
the
southern
mountains
we
ascended
the
southern
side
of
the
valley
which
is
less
steep
and
rocky
than
the
northern
and
in
an
hour
and
a
half
reached
a
fine
spring
called
el
kaszrein
arabic
surrounded
by
verdant
ground
and
tall
reeds
the
bedouins
of
the
tribe
of
beni
naym
here
cultivate
some
dhourra
fields
and
there
are
some
remains
of
ancient
habitations
in
two
hours
and
a
quarter
we
arrived
at
the
top
of
the
mountain
when
we
entered
upon
an
extensive
plain
and
passed
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
city
of
considerable
extent
called
el
kerr
arabic
perhaps
the
ancient
kara
a
bishopric
belonging
to
the
diocese
of
rabba
moabitis
see
reland
palæst
vol
p
nothing
remains
but
heaps
of
stones
the
plain
which
we
crossed
in
a
by
direction
consists
of
a
fertile
soil
and
contains
the
ruins
of
several
villages
at
the
end
of
two
hours
and
three
quarters
we
descended
by
a
steep
road
into
a
wady
and
in
three
hours
reached
the
village
of
ayme
ayme
arabic
situated
upon
a
narrow
plain
at
the
foot
of
high
cliffs
in
its
neighbourhood
are
several
springs
and
wherever
these
are
met
with
vegetation
readily
takes
place
even
among
barren
sandrocks
ayme
is
no
longer
in
the
district
of
kerek
its
sheikh
being
now
under
the
command
of
the
sheikh
of
djebal
whose
residence
is
at
tafyle
one
half
of
the
inhabitants
live
under
tents
and
every
house
has
a
tent
pitched
upon
its
terrace
where
the
people
pass
the
mornings
and
evenings
and
sleep
the
climate
of
all
these
mountains
to
the
southward
of
the
belka
is
extremely
agreeable
the
air
is
pure
and
although
the
heat
is
very
great
in
summer
and
is
still
further
increased
by
the
reflexion
of
the
rays
from
the
rocky
sides
of
the
mountains
yet
the
temperature
never
becomes
suffocating
owing
to
the
refreshing
breeze
which
generally
prevails
i
have
seen
no
part
of
syria
in
which
there
are
so
few
invalids
the
properties
of
the
climate
seem
to
have
been
well
known
to
the
ancients
who
gave
this
district
the
appellation
of
palæstina
tertia
sive
salutaris
the
winter
is
very
cold
deep
snow
falls
and
the
frosts
sometimes
continue
till
the
middle
of
march
this
severe
weather
is
doubly
felt
by
the
inhabitants
as
their
dress
is
little
fitted
to
protect
them
from
it
during
my
stay
in
gebalene
we
had
every
morning
a
fog
which
did
not
disperse
till
day
i
could
perceive
the
vapours
collecting
in
the
ghor
below
which
after
was
completely
enveloped
in
them
during
the
night
they
ascend
the
sides
of
the
mountains
and
in
general
are
not
entirely
dissipated
until
near
from
khanzyre
we
had
the
ghor
all
the
way
on
our
right
about
eight
or
ten
hours
distant
but
in
a
straight
line
not
more
than
six
hours
august
one
hour
and
a
quarter
from
ayme
route
we
reached
tafyle
arabic
built
on
the
declivity
of
a
mountain
at
the
foot
of
which
is
wady
tafyle
this
name
bears
some
resemblance
to
that
of
phanon
or
phynon
which
according
tafyle
to
eusebius
was
situated
between
petra
and
euseb
de
nom
tafyle
contains
about
six
hundred
houses
its
sheikh
is
the
nominal
chief
of
djebal
but
in
reality
the
arabs
howeytat
govern
the
whole
district
and
their
sheikh
has
lately
constructed
a
small
castle
at
tafyle
at
his
own
expense
numerous
springs
and
rivulets
according
to
the
arabs
the
waters
of
which
unite
below
and
flow
into
the
ghor
render
the
vicinity
of
this
town
very
agreeable
it
is
surrounded
by
large
plantations
of
fruit
trees
apples
apricots
figs
pomegranates
and
olive
and
peach
trees
of
a
large
species
are
cultivated
in
great
numbers
the
fruit
is
chiefly
consumed
by
the
inhabitants
and
their
guests
or
exchanged
with
the
bedouin
women
for
butter
the
figs
are
dried
and
pressed
together
in
large
lumps
and
are
thus
exported
to
ghaza
two
long
days
journey
from
hence
the
inhabitants
of
djebal
are
not
so
independent
as
the
kerekein
because
they
have
not
been
able
to
inspire
the
neighbouring
bedouins
with
a
dread
of
their
name
they
pay
a
regular
tribute
to
the
beni
hadjaya
to
the
szaleyt
but
chiefly
to
the
howeytat
who
often
exact
also
extraordinary
donations
wars
frequently
happen
between
the
people
of
djebal
and
of
kerek
principally
on
account
of
persons
who
having
committed
some
offence
fly
from
one
town
to
seek
an
asylum
in
the
other
at
the
time
of
my
visit
a
coolness
had
existed
between
the
two
districts
for
several
months
on
account
of
a
man
of
tafyle
who
having
eloped
with
the
wife
of
another
had
taken
refuge
at
kerek
and
one
of
the
principal
reasons
which
had
induced
our
sheikh
to
undertake
this
journey
was
the
hope
of
being
able
to
bring
the
affair
to
an
amicable
termination
hence
we
were
obliged
to
remain
three
days
at
tafyle
tumultuous
assemblies
were
held
daily
upon
the
subject
and
the
meanest
arab
might
give
his
opinion
though
in
direct
opposition
to
that
of
his
sheikh
the
father
of
the
young
man
who
had
eloped
had
come
with
us
from
kerek
for
the
whole
family
had
been
obliged
to
fly
the
bedouin
laws
entitling
an
injured
husband
to
kill
any
of
the
relations
in
retaliation
for
the
loss
of
his
wife
the
husband
began
by
demanding
from
the
young
father
two
wives
in
return
for
the
one
carried
off
and
the
greater
part
of
the
property
which
the
emigrant
family
possessed
in
tafyle
the
father
of
the
wife
and
her
first
cousin
also
made
demands
of
compensation
for
the
insult
which
their
family
had
received
by
her
elopement
our
sheikh
however
by
his
eloquence
and
address
at
last
got
the
better
of
them
all
indeed
it
must
in
justice
be
said
that
youssef
medjaly
was
not
more
superior
to
the
other
mountaineers
in
the
strength
of
his
arm
and
the
excellence
of
his
horsemanship
than
he
was
by
his
natural
talents
the
affair
was
settled
by
the
father
placing
his
four
infant
daughters
the
youngest
of
whom
was
not
yet
weaned
at
the
disposal
of
the
husband
and
his
who
might
betrothe
them
to
whomsoever
they
chose
and
receive
themselves
the
money
which
is
usually
paid
for
girls
the
four
daughters
were
estimated
at
about
three
thousand
piastres
and
both
parties
seemed
to
be
content
in
testimony
of
peace
being
concluded
between
the
two
families
and
of
the
price
of
blood
being
paid
the
young
father
who
had
not
yet
shewn
himself
publickly
came
to
shake
hands
with
the
injured
husband
a
white
flag
was
suspended
at
the
top
of
the
tent
in
which
we
sat
a
sheep
was
killed
and
we
passed
the
whole
night
in
feasting
and
conversation
the
women
of
tafyle
are
much
more
shy
before
strangers
than
those
of
kerek
the
latter
never
or
at
least
very
seldom
veil
themselves
and
they
discourse
freely
with
all
strangers
the
former
on
the
contrary
imitate
the
city
ladies
in
their
pride
and
reserved
manners
the
inhabitants
of
tafyle
who
are
of
the
tribe
of
djowabere
arabic
supply
the
syrian
hadj
with
a
great
quantity
of
provisions
which
they
sell
to
the
caravan
at
the
castle
el
ahsa
and
the
profits
which
they
derive
from
this
trade
are
sometimes
very
great
it
is
much
to
be
doubted
whether
the
peasants
of
djebal
and
shera
will
be
able
to
continue
their
if
the
syrian
pilgrim
caravan
be
not
soon
the
produce
of
their
soil
hardly
enables
them
to
pay
their
heavy
tribute
to
the
bedouins
besides
feeding
the
strangers
who
alight
at
their
menzels
for
all
the
villages
in
this
part
of
the
country
treat
their
guests
in
the
manner
which
has
already
been
described
the
people
of
djebal
sell
their
wool
butter
and
hides
at
ghaza
where
they
buy
all
the
little
luxuries
which
they
stand
in
need
of
there
are
besides
in
every
village
a
few
shopkeepers
from
el
khalyl
or
hebron
who
make
large
profits
the
people
of
hebron
have
the
reputation
of
being
enterprising
merchants
and
not
so
dishonest
as
their
neighbours
of
palestine
their
pedlars
penetrate
far
into
the
desert
of
arabia
and
a
few
of
them
remain
the
whole
year
round
at
khaibar
in
the
nedjed
the
fields
of
tafyle
are
frequented
by
immense
numbers
of
crows
the
eagle
rakham
is
very
common
in
the
mountains
as
are
also
wild
boars
in
all
the
wadys

particularly
in
those

the
steinbock
or
bouquetin
of
the
swiss

pasture
in
flocks
of
forty
or
fifty
together
great
numbers
of
them
are
killed
by
the
people
of
kerek
and
tafyle
who
hold
their
flesh
in
high
estimation
they
sell
the
large
knotty
horns
to
the
hebron
merchants
who
carry
them
to
jerusalem
where
they
are
worked
into
handles
for
knives
and
daggers
i
saw
a
pair
of
these
horns
at
kerek
three
feet
and
a
half
in
length
the
arabs
told
me
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
a
shot
at
them
and
that
the
hunters
hide
themselves
among
the
reeds
on
the
banks
of
streams
where
the
animals
resort
in
the
evening
to
drink
they
also
asserted
that
when
pursued
they
will
throw
themselves
from
a
height
of
fifty
feet
and
more
upon
their
heads
without
receiving
any
injury
the
same
thing
is
asserted
by
the
hunters
in
the
alps
in
the
mountains
of
belka
kerek
djebal
and
shera
the
bird
katta
this
bird
is
a
species
of
partridge
tetrao
alkatta

is
found
in
large
flocks
in
may
and
june
in
every
part

has
been
particularly
described
in
aleppo
vol
ii
p
is
met
with
in
immense
numbers
they
fly
in
such
large
flocks
that
the
arab
boys
often
kill
two
and
three
at
a
time
merely
by
throwing
a
stick
amongst
them
their
eggs
which
they
lay
in
the
rocky
ground
are
collected
by
the
arabs
it
is
not
improbable
that
this
bird
is
the
seloua
arabic
or
quail
of
the
children
of
israel
the
peasants
of
tafyle
have
but
few
camels

till

bore
august
our
stay
at

we
changed
our
lodgings
twice
every
day
dining
at
one
public
house
and
supping
at
another
we
were
well
treated
and
had
every
evening
a
musical
party
consisting
of
bedouins
famous
for
their
performance
upon
the
rababa
or
guitar
of
the
desert
and
who
knew
all
the
new
bedouin
poetry
by
heart
i
here
met
a
man
from
aintab
near
aleppo
who
hearing
me
talk
of
his
native

took
a
great
liking
to
me
and
shewed
me
every
civility

left

a

still

defeated
the
djowabere
and
took
tafyle
where
they
constructed
a
castle

election
they
also
built
at
the

time
the

then
emigrated
to
this
place

appears
to
have
been
in
ancient
times
a
considerable
city
if
we
may
judge
from
the
ruins
which
surround

beszeyra
demanded
of
him
we
found
here
a
small
encampment
of
howeytat
arabs
to
one
of
whom
the
sheikh
recommended
me
he
professed
to
know
the
man
well
and
assured
me
that
he
was
a
proper
guide
we
settled
the
price
of
his
hire
to
cairo
at
eighty
piastres
and
he
was
to
provide
me
with
a
camel
for
myself
and
baggage
this
was
ain
djedolat
the
last
friendly
service
of
sheikh
youssef
towards
me
but
i
afterwards
learnt
that
he
received
for
his
interest
in
making
the
bargain
fifteen
piastres
from
the
arab
who
instead
of
eighty
would
have
been
content
with
forty
piastres
after
the
sheikh
had
departed
on
his
return
my
new
guide
told
me
that
his
camels
were
at
another
encampment
one
distance
to
the
south
and
that
he
had
but
one
with
him
which
was
necessary
for
the
transport
of
his
tent
this
avowal
was
sufficient
to
make
me
understand
the
character
of
the
man
but
i
still
relied
on
the
recommendation
in
order
to
settle
with
the
guide
i
sold
my
mare
for
four
goats
and
for
piastres
worth
of
corn
a
part
of
which
i
delivered
to
him
and
i
had
the
remainder
ground
into
flour
for
our
provision
during
the
journey
he
took
the
goats
in
payment
of
his
services
and
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
give
him
twenty
piastres
more
on
reaching
cairo
i
had
still
about
eighty
piastres
in
gold
but
kept
them
carefully
concealed
in
case
of
some
great
emergency
for
i
knew
that
if
i
were
to
shew
a
single
sequin
the
arabs
would
suppose
that
i
possessed
several
hundreds
and
would
either
have
robbed
me
of
them
or
prevented
me
from
proceeding
on
my
journey
by
the
most
exorbitant
demands
august
remained
two
days
at
beszeyra
and
then
set
out
with
the
family
of
my
guide
consisting
of
his
wife
two
children
and
a
servant
girl
we
were
on
foot
and
drove
before
us
the
loaded
camel
and
a
few
sheep
and
goats
our
road
ascended
at
three
quarters
of
an
hour
we
came
to
a
spring
in
the
mountain
the
rock
is
here
calcareous
with
basalt
at
two
hours
and
a
half
was
ain
djedolat
arabic
a
spring
of
excellent
water
here
the
mountain
is
overgrown
with
short
balout
trees
at
the
end
of
two
hours
and
three
quarters
direction
we
reached
the
top
of
the
mountain
which
is
covered
with
large
blocks
of
basalt
here
a
fine
view
opened
upon
us
to
our
right
we
had
the
deep
valley
of
wady
dhana
with
the
village
of
the
el
ghoeyr
same
name
on
its
side
farther
west
about
four
hours
from
dhana
we
saw
the
great
valley
of
the
ghor
and
towards
the
and
extended
the
wide
arabian
desert
which
the
syrian
pilgrims
cross
in
their
way
to
medina
in
three
hours
and
a
quarter
after
a
slight
descent
we
reached
the
plain
here
consisting
of
arable
ground
covered
with
flints
we
passed
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
town
or
large
village
called
el
dhahel
arabic
the
castle
of
aaneiza
arabic
with
an
insulated
hillock
near
it
a
station
of
the
pilgrims
bore
distant
about
five
hours
the
town
of
maan
distant
ten
or
twelve
hours
and
the
castle
el
shobak
east
of
aaneiza
runs
a
chain
of
hills
called
teloul
djaafar
arabic
proceeding
a
little
farther
we
came
to
the
high
borders
of
a
broad
valley
called
el
ghoeyr
arabic
diminutive
of
arabic
el
ghor
to
the
of
wady
dhana
looking
down
into
this
valley
we
saw
at
a
distance
a
troop
of
horsemen
encamped
near
a
spring
they
had
espied
us
and
immediately
mounted
their
horses
in
pursuit
of
us
although
several
people
had
joined
our
little
caravan
on
the
road
there
was
only
one
armed
man
amongst
us
except
myself
the
general
opinion
was
that
the
horsemen
belonged
to
the
beni
szakher
the
enemies
of
the
howeytat
who
often
make
inroads
into
this
district
there
was
therefore
no
time
to
lose
we
drove
the
cattle
hastily
back
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
hid
them
with
the
women
and
baggage
behind
some
rocks
near
the
road
and
we
then
took
to
our
heels
towards
the
village
of
dhana
arabic
which
we
reached
in
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
extremely
exhausted
for
it
was
about
two
in
the
afternoon
and
the
heat
was
excessive
in
order
to
run
more
nimbly
over
the
rocks
i
took
off
my
heavy
arab
shoes
and
thus
i
was
the
first
to
reach
the
village
but
the
sharp
flints
of
the
mountain
wounded
my
feet
so
much
that
after
reposing
a
little
i
could
hardly
stand
upon
my
legs
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
felt
fear
during
my
travels
dhana
in
the
desert
for
i
knew
that
if
i
fell
in
with
the
beni
szakher
without
any
body
to
protect
me
they
would
certainly
kill
me
as
they
did
all
persons
whom
they
supposed
to
belong
to
their
inveterate
enemy
the
pasha
of
damascus
and
my
appearance
was
very
much
that
of
a
damascene
our
fears
however
were
unfounded
the
party
that
pursued
us
proved
to
be
howeytat
who
were
coming
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
sheikh
at
tafyle
the
consequence
was
that
two
of
our
companions
who
had
staid
behind
because
being
inhabitants
of
maan
and
friends
of
the
beni
szakher
they
conceived
themselves
secure
were
stripped
by
the
pursuers
whose
tribe
was
at
war
with
the
people
of
maan
dhana
which
i
suppose
to
be
the
ancient
thoana
is
prettily
situated
on
the
declivity
of
tor
dhana
the
highest
mountain
of
djebal
and
has
fine
gardens
and
very
extensive
tobacco
plantations
the
howeytat
have
built
a
tower
in
the
village
the
inhabitants
were
now
at
war
with
those
of
beszeyra
but
both
parties
respect
the
lives
of
their
enemies
and
their
hostile
expeditions
are
directed
against
the
cattle
only
having
reposed
at
dhana
we
returned
in
the
evening
to
the
spot
where
we
had
left
the
women
and
the
baggage
and
rested
for
the
night
at
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
beyond
it
august
skirted
for
about
an
hour
the
eastern
borders
of
wady
ghoeyr
when
we
descended
into
the
valley
and
reached
its
bottom
at
the
end
of
three
hours
and
a
half
travelling
at
a
slow
pace
this
wady
divides
the
district
of
djebal
from
that
of
djebal
shera
arabic
or
the
mountains
of
shera
which
continue
southwards
towards
the
akaba
these
are
the
mountains
called
in
the
scriptures
mount
seir
the
territory
of
the
edomites
the
valley
of
ghoeyr
is
a
large
rocky
and
uneven
basin
considerably
lower
than
the
eastern
plain
upwards
of
twelve
miles
across
at
its
eastern
extremity
but
narrowing
towards
el
ghoeyr
the
west
it
is
intersected
by
numerous
wadys
of
winter
torrents
and
by
three
or
four
valleys
watered
by
rivulets
which
unite
below
and
flow
into
the
ghor
the
ghoeyr
is
famous
for
the
excellent
pasturage
produced
by
its
numerous
springs
and
it
has
in
consequence
become
a
favourite
place
of
encampment
for
all
the
bedouins
of
djebal
and
shera
the
borders
of
the
rivulets
are
overgrown
with
defle
and
the
shrub
rethem
arabic
the
rock
is
principally
calcareous
and
there
are
detached
pieces
of
basalt
and
large
tracts
of
brescia
formed
of
sand
flint
and
pieces
of
calcareous
stone
in
the
bottom
of
the
valley
we
passed
two
rivulets
one
of
which
is
called
seil
megharye
arabic
where
we
arrived
at
the
end
of
a
four
hours
walk
and
found
some
bedouin
women
washing
their
blue
gowns
and
the
wide
shirts
of
their
husbands
i
had
taken
the
lead
of
our
party
accompanied
by
my
little
boy
with
whom
i
reached
an
encampment
on
the
southern
side
of
the
valley
to
which
these
women
belonged
this
was
the
encampment
to
which
my
guide
belonged
and
where
he
assured
me
that
i
should
find
his
camels
i
was
astonished
to
see
nobody
but
women
in
the
tents
but
was
told
that
the
greater
part
of
the
men
had
gone
to
ghaza
to
sell
the
which
these
arabs
collect
in
the
mountains
of
shera
the
ladies
being
thus
left
to
themselves
had
no
impediment
to
the
satisfying
of
their
curiosity
which
was
very
great
at
seeing
a
townsman
and
what
was
still
more
extraordinary
a
man
of
damascus
for
so
i
was
called
under
their
tents
they
crowded
about
me
and
were
incessant
in
their
inquiries
respecting
my
affairs
the
goods
i
had
to
sell
the
dress
of
the
town
ladies
when
they
found
that
i
had
nothing
to
sell
nor
any
thing
to
present
to
them
they
soon
retired
they
however
informed
me
that
my
guide
had
no
other
camels
in
his
possession
than
the
one
we
had
brought
with
us
which
was
already
lame
he
soon
afterwards
arrived
and
when
i
began
to
expostulate
with
him
on
his
conduct
he
assured
me
that
his
camel
would
be
able
to
carry
us
all
the
way
to
egypt
but
begged
me
to
wait
a
few
days
longer
until
he
should
be
well
enough
to
walk
by
its
side
for
since
we
left
beszeyra
he
had
been
constantly
complaining
of
rheumatic
pains
in
his
legs
i
saw
that
all
this
was
done
to
gain
time
and
to
put
me
out
of
patience
in
order
to
cheat
me
of
the
wages
he
had
already
received
but
as
we
were
to
proceed
on
the
following
day
to
another
encampment
at
a
few
hours
distance
i
did
not
choose
to
say
any
thing
more
to
him
on
the
subject
in
a
place
where
i
had
nobody
but
women
to
take
my
part
hoping
to
be
able
to
attack
him
more
effectually
in
the
presence
of
his
own
august
remained
this
day
at
the
tents
and
i
amused
myself
with
visiting
almost
every
tent
in
the
encampment
these
women
being
accustomed
to
receive
strangers
in
the
absence
of
their
husbands
the
howeytat
arabs
resemble
the
egyptians
in
their
features
they
are
much
leaner
and
taller
than
the
northern
arabs
the
skin
of
many
of
them
is
almost
black
and
their
features
are
much
less
regular
than
those
of
the
northern
bedouins
especially
the
aeneze
the
women
are
tall
and
well
made
but
too
lean
and
even
the
handsomest
among
them
are
disfigured
by
broad
cheek
bones
the
howeytat
occupy
the
whole
of
the
shera
as
far
as
akaba
and
south
of
it
to
moyeleh
arabic
five
days
from
akaba
on
the
egyptian
hadj
road
to
the
east
they
encamp
as
far
as
akaba
el
shamy
or
the
akaba
on
the
syrian
pilgrim
route
while
the
northern
howeytat
take
up
their
winter
quarters
in
the
ghor
the
strength
of
their
position
in
these
mountains
renders
them
secure
from
the
attacks
of
the
numerous
hordes
of
bedouins
who
encamp
in
the
eastern
arabian
desert
they
are
however
in
continual
warfare
with
them
and
sometimes
undertake
expeditions
of
twenty
days
journey
in
order
to
surprise
some
encampment
of
their
enemies
in
the
plains
of
the
nedjed
the
beni
szakher
are
most
dreaded
by
them
on
account
of
their
acquaintance
with
the
country
and
peace
seldom
lasts
long
between
the
two
tribes
the
encampment
where
i
spent
this
day
was
robbed
of
all
its
camels
last
winter
by
the
beni
szakher
who
drove
off
in
one
morning
upwards
of
twelve
hundred
belonging
to
their
enemies
the
howeytat
receive
considerable
sums
of
money
as
a
tribute
from
the
egyptian
pilgrim
caravan
they
also
levy
certain
contributions
upon
the
castles
on
the
syrian
hadj
route
situated
between
maan
and
tebouk
which
they
consider
as
forming
a
part
of
their
territory
they
have
become
the
carriers
of
the
egyptian
hadj
in
the
same
manner
as
the
aeneze
transport
with
their
camels
the
syrian
pilgrims
and
their
baggage
when
at
variance
with
the
pashas
of
egypt
the
howeytat
have
been
known
to
plunder
the
caravan
a
case
of
this
kind
happened
about
ten
years
ago
when
the
hadj
was
returning
from
mekka
the
principal
booty
consisted
of
several
thousand
camel
loads
of
mocha
coffee
an
article
which
the
pilgrims
are
in
the
constant
habit
of
bringing
for
sale
to
cairo
the
bedouins
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
so
large
a
quantity
sold
the
greater
part
of
it
at
hebron
tafyle
and
kerek
and
that
year
happening
to
be
a
year
of
dearth
they
gave
for
every
measure
of
corn
an
equal
measure
of
coffee
the
howeytat
became
wahabis
but
they
paid
tribute
only
for
one
year
and
have
now
joined
their
forces
with
those
of
mohammed
aly
against
ibn
saoud
august
set
out
for
the
encampment
of
the
sheikh
of
the
northern
howeytat
with
the
tent
and
family
of
my
guide
who
was
afraid
of
leaving
them
in
this
place
where
be
thought
himself
too
much
exposed
to
the
incursions
of
the
beni
szakher
we
ascended
on
foot
through
many
wadys
of
winter
torrents
up
the
southern
mountains
of
the
ghoeyr
we
passed
several
springs
and
the
ruined
place
called
szyhhan
arabic
and
at
the
end
of
three
hours
walk
arrived
at
a
large
encampment
of
the
howeytat
situated
near
the
summit
of
the
basin
of
the
ghoeyr
it
is
usual
when
an
arab
with
his
tent
reaches
an
encampment
placed
in
a
douar
arabic
or
circle
that
some
of
the
families
strike
their
tents
and
pitch
them
again
in
such
a
way
as
to
widen
the
circle
for
the
admission
of
the
tent
but
the
character
of
my
guide
did
not
appear
to
be
sufficiently
respectable
to
entitle
him
to
this
compliment
for
not
a
tent
was
moved
and
he
was
obliged
to
encamp
alone
out
of
the
circle
in
the
hope
that
they
would
soon
break
up
for
some
other
spot
where
he
might
obtain
a
place
in
the
douar
these
arabs
are
much
poorer
than
the
aeneze
and
consequently
live
much
worse
had
it
not
been
for
the
supply
of
butter
which
i
bought
at
beszeyra
i
should
have
had
nothing
but
dry
bread
to
eat
there
was
not
a
drop
of
milk
to
be
got
for
at
this
time
of
the
year
the
ewes
are
dry
of
camels
there
was
but
about
half
a
dozen
in
the
whole
encampment
i
here
came
to
an
explanation
with
my
guide
who
i
saw
was
determined
to
cheat
me
out
of
the
wages
he
had
already
received
i
told
him
that
i
was
tired
of
his
subterfuges
and
was
resolved
to
travel
with
him
no
longer
and
i
insisted
upon
his
returning
me
the
goats
or
hiring
me
another
guide
in
his
stead
he
offered
me
only
one
of
the
goats
after
a
sharp
dispute
therefore
i
arose
took
my
gun
and
swore
that
i
would
never
his
tent
accompanying
my
oath
with
a
malediction
upon
him
and
upon
those
who
should
receive
him
into
their
encampment
for
i
had
been
previously
informed
that
he
was
not
a
real
howeytat
but
of
the
tribe
of
billy
the
individuals
of
which
are
dispersed
over
the
whole
desert
on
quitting
his
tent
i
was
surrounded
by
the
bedouins
of
the
encampment
who
told
me
that
they
had
been
silent
till
now
because
it
was
not
their
affair
to
interfere
between
a
host
and
his
guest
but
that
they
never
would
permit
a
stranger
to
depart
in
that
way
that
i
ought
to
declare
myself
to
be
under
the
protection
who
would
do
me
justice
this
being
what
i
had
anticipated
i
immediately
entered
the
tent
of
the
sheikh
who
happened
to
be
absent
my
guide
now
changed
his
tone
and
began
by
offering
me
two
goats
to
settle
our
differences
in
the
evening
the
sheikh
arrived
and
after
a
long
debate
i
got
back
my
four
goats
but
the
wheat
which
i
had
received
at
beszeyra
as
the
remaining
part
of
the
payment
for
my
mare
was
left
to
the
guide
in
return
for
his
good
offices
the
sheikh
begged
me
to
let
him
have
my
gun
which
was
worth
about
fifteen
piastres
i
presented
it
to
him
and
he
acknowledged
the
favour
by
telling
me
that
he
knew
an
honest
man
in
a
neighbouring
encampment
who
had
a
strong
camel
and
would
be
ready
to
serve
me
as
a
guide
august
took
a
boy
to
shew
me
the
way
to
this
person
and
driving
my
little
flock
before
us
we
reached
the
encampment
which
was
about
one
hour
to
the
westward
the
boy
told
the
bedouin
that
i
had
become
the
brother
i
was
therefore
well
received
and
soon
formed
a
favourable
opinion
of
this
arab
who
engaged
to
take
me
to
cairo
for
the
four
goats
which
i
was
to
deliver
to
him
now
and
twenty
piastres
about
one
pound
sterling
to
be
paid
on
my
arrival
in
egypt
this
will
be
considered
a
very
small
sum
for
a
journey
of
nearly
four
hundred
miles
but
a
bedouin
puts
very
little
value
upon
time
fatigue
and
labour
while
i
am
writing
this
many
hundred
loaded
camels
belonging
to
bedouins
depart
every
week
from
cairo
for
akaba
a
journey
of
ten
days
for
which
they
receive
piastres
per
camel
had
i
been
known
to
be
an
european
i
certainly
should
not
have
been
able
to
move
without
promising
at
least
a
thousand
piastres

my
guide
the

the
morning
i
went
to
the

bears
some
resemblance
to

is
better
adapted
for

it
is
not
commanded
by
any

at
the
foot
of
the
hill
are
two
springs
surrounded
by

and

the
castle

is
one
of
the
largest

it
is
not

who
cultivate

as
i
had
no

did
not

i
procured
at

my
only
spare

remained
in

delayed
his
departure
in
order
to
obtain
from
his
friends
some
commissions
for
cairo
upon
which
he
might
gain
a
few
piastres
in
the
afternoon
of
this
day
we
had
a
shower
of
rain
with
so
violent
a
gust
of
wind
that
all
the
tents
of
the
encampment
were
thrown
down
at
the
same
moment
for
the
poles
are
fastened
in
the
ground
very
carelessly
during
the
summer
months
august
whole
encampment
broke
up
in
the
morning
some
bedouins
having
brought
intelligence
that
a
strong
party
of
beni
szakher
had
been
seen
in
the
district
of
djebal
the
greater
part
of
the
males
of
the
howeytat
together
with
their
principal
sheikh
ibn
rashyd
arabic
were
gone
to
egypt
in
order
to
transport
the
army
across
the
desert
to
akaba
and
yambo
we
had
therefore
no
means
of
defence
against
these
formidable
enemies
and
were
obliged
to
take
refuge
in
the
neighbourhood
of
shobak
where
they
would
not
dare
to
attack
the
encampment
when
the
bedouins
encamp
in
small
numbers
they
choose
a
spot
surrounded
by
high
ground
to
prevent
their
tents
from
being
wady
nedjed
seen
at
a
distance
the
camp
is
however
not
unfrequently
betrayed
by
the
camels
which
pasture
in
the
vicinity
in
the
evening
we
took
our
final
departure
crossing
an
uneven
plain
covered
with
flints
and
the
ruins
of
several
villages
and
then
descended
into
the
wady
nedjed
arabic
the
rivulet
whose
source
is
in
a
large
paved
basin
in
the
valley
joins
that
of
shobak
upon
the
hills
which
border
this
pleasant
valley
are
the
ruins
of
a
large
town
of
the
same
name
of
which
nothing
remains
but
broken
walls
and
heaps
of
stones
in
one
hour
and
a
quarter
from
our
encampment
and
about
as
far
from
shobak
we
reached
the
camp
of
another
tribe
of
fellahein
bedouins
called
refaya
arabic
where
we
slept
they
are
people
of
good
property
for
which
they
are
indebted
to
their
courage
in
opposing
the
extortions
of
the
howeytat
here
were
about
sixty
tents
and
one
hundred
firelocks
their
herds
of
cows
sheep
and
goats
are
very
numerous
but
they
have
few
camels
besides
corn
fields
they
have
extensive
vineyards
and
sell
great
quantities
of
dried
grapes
at
ghaza
and
to
the
syrian
pilgrims
of
the
hadj
they
have
the
reputation
of
being
very
daring
thieves
august
was
particularly
desirous
of
visiting
wady
mousa
of
the
antiquities
of
which
i
had
heard
the
country
people
speak
in
terms
of
great
admiration
and
from
thence
i
had
hoped
to
cross
the
desert
in
a
straight
line
to
cairo
but
my
guide
was
afraid
of
the
hazards
of
a
journey
through
the
desert
and
insisted
upon
my
taking
the
road
by
akaba
the
ancient
eziongeber
at
the
extremity
of
the
eastern
branch
of
the
red
sea
where
he
said
that
we
might
join
some
caravans
and
continue
our
route
towards
egypt
i
wished
on
the
contrary
to
avoid
akaba
as
i
knew
that
the
pasha
of
egypt
kept
there
a
numerous
garrison
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
wahabi
and
of
his
rival
the
pasha
of
damascus
saoudye
a
person
therefore
like
myself
coming
from
the
latter
place
without
any
papers
to
shew
who
i
was
or
why
i
had
taken
that
circuitous
route
would
certainly
have
roused
the
suspicions
of
the
officer
commanding
at
akaba
and
the
consequences
might
have
been
dangerous
to
me
among
the
savage
soldiery
of
that
garrison
the
road
from
shobak
to
akaba
which
is
tolerably
good
and
might
easily
be
rendered
practicable
even
to
artillery
lies
to
the
of
wady
mousa
and
to
have
quitted
it
out
of
mere
curiosity
to
see
the
wady
would
have
looked
very
suspicious
in
the
eyes
of
the
arabs
i
therefore
pretended
to
have
made
a
vow
to
slaughter
a
goat
in
honour
of
haroun
aaron
whose
tomb
i
knew
was
situated
at
the
extremity
of
the
valley
and
by
this
stratagem
i
thought
that
i
should
have
the
means
of
seeing
the
valley
in
my
way
to
the
tomb
to
this
my
guide
had
nothing
to
oppose
the
dread
of
drawing
upon
himself
by
resistance
the
wrath
of
haroun
completely
silenced
him
we
left
the
refaya
early
in
the
morning
and
travelled
over
hilly
ground
at
the
end
of
two
hours
we
reached
an
encampment
of
arabs
saoudye
arabic
who
are
also
fellahein
or
cultivators
and
the
strongest
of
the
peasant
tribes
though
they
pay
tribute
to
the
howeytat
like
the
refaya
they
dry
large
quantities
of
grapes
they
lay
up
the
produce
of
their
harvest
in
a
kind
of
fortress
called
oerak
arabic
not
far
from
their
camp
where
are
a
few
houses
surrounded
by
a
stone
wall
they
have
upwards
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
tents
we
breakfasted
with
the
saoudye
and
then
pursued
the
windings
of
a
valley
where
i
saw
many
vestiges
of
former
cultivation
and
here
and
there
some
remains
of
walls
and
paved
roads
all
constructed
of
flints
the
country
hereabouts
is
woody
in
three
hours
and
a
half
we
passed
a
spring
from
whence
we
ascended
a
mountain
and
travelled
for
some
time
along
its
barren
summit
in
a
direction
when
we
again
descended
and
reached
ain
eldjy
mousa
distant
five
hours
and
a
half
from
where
we
had
set
out
in
the
morning
upon
the
summit
of
the
mountain
near
the
spot
where
the
road
to
wady
mousa
diverges
from
the
great
road
to
akaba
are
a
number
of
small
heaps
of
stones
indicating
so
many
sacrifices
to
haroun
the
arabs
who
make
vows
to
slaughter
a
victim
to
haroun
think
it
sufficient
to
proceed
as
far
as
this
place
from
whence
the
dome
of
the
tomb
is
visible
in
the
distance
and
after
killing
the
animal
they
throw
a
heap
of
stones
over
the
blood
which
flows
to
the
ground
here
my
guide
pressed
me
to
slaughter
the
goat
which
i
had
brought
with
me
from
shobak
for
the
purpose
but
i
pretended
that
i
had
vowed
to
immolate
it
at
the
tomb
itself
upon
a
hill
over
the
ain
mousa
the
arabs
lyathene
arabic
were
encamped
who
cultivate
the
valley
of
mousa
we
repaired
to
their
encampment
but
were
not
so
hospitably
received
as
we
had
been
the
night
before
ain
mousa
is
a
copious
spring
rushing
from
under
a
rock
at
the
eastern
extremity
of
wady
mousa
there
are
no
ruins
near
the
spring
a
little
lower
down
in
the
valley
is
a
mill
and
above
it
is
the
village
of
badabde
arabic
now
abandoned
it
was
inhabited
till
within
a
few
years
by
about
twenty
families
of
greek
christians
who
subsequently
retired
to
kerek
proceeding
from
the
spring
along
the
rivulet
for
about
twenty
minutes
the
valley
opens
and
leads
into
a
plain
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
length
and
ten
minutes
in
breadth
in
which
the
rivulet
joins
with
another
descending
from
the
mountain
to
the
southward
upon
the
declivity
of
the
mountain
in
the
angle
formed
by
the
junction
of
the
two
rivulets
stands
eldjy
arabic
the
principal
village
of
wady
mousa
this
place
contains
between
two
and
three
hundred
houses
and
is
enclosed
by
a
stone
wall
with
three
regular
gates
it
is
most
picturesquely
situated
and
is
inhabited
by
the
wady
mousa
lyathene
abovementioned
a
part
of
whom
encamp
during
the
whole
year
in
the
neighbouring
mountains
the
slopes
of
the
mountain
near
the
town
are
formed
into
artificial
terraces
covered
with
corn
fields
and
plantations
of
fruit
trees
they
are
irrigated
by
the
waters
of
the
two
rivulets
and
of
many
smaller
springs
which
descend
into
the
valley
below
eldjy
where
the
soil
is
also
well
cultivated
a
few
large
hewn
stones
dispersed
over
the
present
town
indicate
the
former
existence
of
an
ancient
city
in
this
spot
the
happy
situation
of
which
must
in
all
ages
have
attracted
inhabitants
i
saw
here
some
large
pieces
of
beautiful
saline
marble
but
nobody
could
tell
me
from
whence
they
had
come
or
whether
there
were
any
rocks
of
this
stone
in
the
mountains
of
shera
i
hired
a
guide
at
eldjy
to
conduct
me
to
tomb
and
paid
him
with
a
pair
of
old
he
carried
the
goat
and
gave
me
a
skin
of
water
to
carry
as
he
knew
that
there
was
no
water
in
the
wady
below
in
following
the
rivulet
of
eldjy
westwards
the
valley
soon
narrows
again
and
it
is
here
that
the
antiquities
of
wady
mousa
begin
of
these
i
regret
that
i
am
not
able
to
give
a
very
complete
account
but
i
knew
well
the
character
of
the
people
around
me
i
was
without
protection
in
the
midst
of
a
desert
where
no
traveller
had
ever
before
been
seen
and
a
close
examination
of
these
works
of
the
infidels
as
they
are
called
would
have
excited
suspicions
that
i
was
a
magician
in
search
of
treasures
i
should
at
least
have
been
detained
and
prevented
from
prosecuting
my
journey
to
egypt
and
in
all
probability
should
have
been
stripped
of
the
little
money
which
i
possessed
and
what
was
infinitely
more
valuable
to
me
of
my
journal
book
future
travellers
may
visit
the
spot
under
the
protection
of
an
armed
force
the
inhabitants
will
become
more
accustomed
to
the
researches
of
strangers
and
the
antiquities
of
wady
mousa
will
then
be
found
to
rank
amongst
the
most
curious
remains
of
ancient
art
at
the
point
where
the
valley
becomes
narrow
is
a
large
sepulchral
vault
with
a
handsome
door
hewn
in
the
rock
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
which
rises
from
the
right
bank
of
the
torrent
on
the
same
side
of
the
rivulet
a
little
farther
on
i
saw
some
other
sepulchres
with
singular
ornaments
here
a
mass
of
rock
has
been
insulated
from
the
mountain
by
an
excavation
which
leaves
a
passage
five
or
six
paces
in
breadth
between
it
and
the
mountain
it
forms
nearly
a
cube
of
sixteen
feet
the
top
being
a
little
narrower
than
the
base
the
lower
part
is
hollowed
into
a
small
sepulchral
cave
with
a
low
door
but
the
upper
part
of
the
mass
is
solid
there
are
three
of
these
mausolea
at
a
short
distance
from
each
other
a
few
paces
lower
on
the
left
side
of
the
stream
is
a
larger
mausoleum
similarly
formed
which
appears
from
its
decayed
state
and
the
style
of
its
architecture
to
be
of
more
ancient
date
than
the
others
over
its
entrance
are
four
obelisks
about
ten
feet
in
height
cut
out
of
the
same
piece
of
rock
below
is
a
projecting
ornament
but
so
much
defaced
by
time
that
i
was
unable
to
discover
what
it
had
originally
represented
it
had
however
nothing
of
the
egyptian
style
continuing
for
about
three
hundred
paces
farther
along
the
valley
which
is
in
this
part
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
breadth
several
small
tombs
are
met
with
on
both
sides
of
the
rivulet
excavated
in
the
rock
without
any
ornaments
beyond
these
is
a
spot
where
the
valley
seemed
to
be
entirely
closed
by
high
rocks
but
upon
a
nearer
approach
i
perceived
a
chasm
about
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
in
breadth
through
which
the
rivulet
flows
westwards
in
winter
in
summer
its
waters
are
lost
in
the
sand
and
gravel
before
they
reach
the
opening
which
is
called
el
syk
arabic
the
precipices
on
either
side
of
the
torrent
are
about
in
height
in
many
places
the
opening
between
them
at
top
is
less
than
at
bottom
and
the
sky
is
not
visible
from
below
as
the
rivulet
of
wady
mousa
must
have
been
of
the
greatest
importance
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
valley
and
more
particularly
of
the
city
which
was
entirely
situated
on
the
west
side
of
the
syk
great
pains
seem
to
have
been
taken
by
the
ancients
to
regulate
its
course
its
bed
appears
to
have
been
covered
with
a
stone
pavement
of
which
many
vestiges
yet
remain
and
in
several
places
stone
walls
were
constructed
on
both
sides
to
give
the
water
its
proper
direction
and
to
check
the
violence
of
the
torrent
a
channel
was
likewise
cut
on
each
side
of
the
syk
on
a
higher
level
than
the
river
to
convey
a
constant
supply
of
water
into
the
city
in
all
seasons
and
to
prevent
all
the
water
from
being
absorbed
in
summer
by
the
broad
torrent
bed
or
by
the
irrigation
of
the
fields
in
the
valley
above
the
syk
about
fifty
paces
below
the
entrance
of
the
syk
a
bridge
of
one
arch
thrown
over
the
top
of
the
chasm
is
still
entire
immediately
below
it
on
both
sides
are
large
niches
worked
in
the
rock
with
elegant
sculptures
destined
probably
for
the
reception
of
statues
some
remains
of
antiquities
might
perhaps
be
found
on
the
top
of
the
rocks
near
the
bridge
but
my
guide
assured
me
that
notwithstanding
repeated
endeavours
had
been
made
nobody
had
ever
been
able
to
climb
up
the
rocks
to
the
bridge
which
was
therefore
unanimously
declared
to
be
the
work
of
the
djan
or
evil
genii
in
continuing
along
the
winding
passage
of
the
syk
i
saw
in
several
places
small
niches
cut
in
the
rock
some
of
which
were
single
in
other
places
there
were
three
or
four
together
without
any
regularity
some
are
mere
holes
others
have
short
pilasters
on
both
sides
they
vary
in
size
from
ten
inches
to
four
or
five
feet
in
height
and
in
some
of
them
the
bases
of
statues
are
still
visible
we
passed
several
collateral
chasms
between
perpendicular
rocks
by
which
some
tributary
torrents
from
the
south
side
of
the
syk
empty
themselves
into
the
river
i
did
not
enter
any
of
them
but
i
saw
that
they
were
thickly
overgrown
with
defle
trees
my
guide
told
me
that
no
antiquities
existed
in
these
valleys
but
the
testimony
of
these
people
on
such
subjects
is
little
to
be
relied
on
the
bottom
of
the
syk
itself
is
at
present
covered
with
large
stones
brought
down
by
the
torrent
and
it
appears
to
be
several
feet
higher
than
its
ancient
level
at
least
towards
its
western
extremity
after
proceeding
for
minutes
between
the
rocks
we
came
to
a
place
where
the
passage
opens
and
where
the
bed
of
another
stream
coming
from
the
south
joins
the
syk
on
the
side
of
the
perpendicular
rock
directly
opposite
to
the
issue
of
the
main
valley
an
excavated
mausoleum
came
in
view
the
situation
and
beauty
of
which
are
calculated
to
make
an
extraordinary
impression
upon
the
traveller
after
having
traversed
for
nearly
half
an
hour
such
a
gloomy
and
almost
subterraneous
passage
as
i
have
described
it
is
one
of
the
most
elegant
remains
of
antiquity
existing
in
syria
its
state
of
preservation
resembles
that
of
a
building
recently
finished
and
on
a
closer
examination
i
found
it
to
be
a
work
of
immense
labour
the
principal
part
is
a
chamber
sixteen
paces
square
and
about
five
feet
high
there
is
not
the
smallest
ornament
on
the
walls
which
are
quite
smooth
as
well
as
the
roof
but
the
outside
of
the
entrance
door
is
richly
embellished
with
architectural
decorations
several
broad
steps
lead
up
to
the
entrance
and
in
front
of
all
is
a
colonnade
of
four
columns
standing
between
two
pilasters
on
each
of
the
three
sides
of
the
great
chamber
is
an
apartment
for
the
reception
of
the
dead
a
similar
excavation
but
larger
opens
into
each
end
of
the
vestibule
the
length
of
which
latter
is
not
equal
to
that
of
the
colonnade
as
it
appears
in
front
but
terminates
at
either
end
between
the
pilaster
and
the
neighbouring
column
the
doors
of
the
two
apartments
opening
into
the
vestibule
are
covered
with
carvings
richer
and
more
beautiful
than
those
on
the
door
of
the
principal
chamber
the
colonnade
is
about
feet
high
and
the
columns
are
about
three
feet
in
diameter
with
corinthian
capitals
the
pilasters
at
the
two
extremities
of
the
colonnade
and
the
two
columns
nearest
to
them
are
formed
out
of
the
solid
rock
like
all
the
rest
of
the
monument
but
the
two
centre
columns
one
of
which
has
fallen
were
constructed
separately
and
were
composed
of
three
pieces
each
the
colonnade
is
crowned
with
a
pediment
above
which
are
other
ornaments
which
if
i
distinguished
them
correctly
consisted
of
an
insulated
cylinder
crowned
with
a
vase
standing
between
two
other
structures
in
the
shape
of
small
temples
supported
by
short
pillars
the
entire
front
from
the
base
of
the
columns
to
the
top
of
the
ornaments
may
be
sixty
or
feet
the
architrave
of
the
colonnade
is
adorned
with
vases
connected
together
with
festoons
the
exterior
wall
of
the
chamber
at
each
end
of
the
vestibule
which
presents
itself
to
the
front
between
the
pilaster
and
the
neighbouring
column
was
ornamented
with
colossal
figures
in
but
i
could
not
make
out
what
they
represented
one
of
them
appears
to
have
been
a
female
mounted
upon
an
animal
which
from
the
tail
and
hind
leg
appears
to
have
been
a
camel
all
the
other
ornaments
sculptured
on
the
monument
are
in
perfect
preservation
the
natives
call
this
monument
kaszr
faraoun
arabic
or
castle
and
pretend
that
it
was
the
residence
of
a
prince
but
it
was
rather
the
sepulchre
of
a
prince
and
great
must
have
been
the
opulence
of
a
city
which
could
dedicate
such
monuments
to
the
memory
of
its
rulers
from
this
place
as
i
before
observed
the
syk
widens
and
the
road
continues
for
a
few
hundred
paces
lower
down
through
a
spacious
passage
between
the
two
cliffs
several
very
large
sepulchres
are
excavated
in
the
rocks
on
both
sides
they
consist
generally
of
a
single
lofty
apartment
with
a
flat
roof
some
of
them
are
larger
than
the
principal
chamber
in
the
kaszr
faraoun
of
those
which
i
entered
the
walls
were
quite
plain
and
unornamented
in
some
of
them
are
small
side
rooms
with
excavations
and
recesses
in
the
rock
for
the
reception
of
the
dead
in
others
i
found
the
floor
itself
irregularly
excavated
for
the
same
purpose
in
compartments
six
to
eight
feet
deep
and
of
the
shape
of
a
coffin
in
the
floor
of
one
sepulchre
i
counted
as
many
as
twelve
cavities
of
this
kind
besides
a
deep
niche
in
the
wall
where
the
bodies
of
the
principal
members
of
the
family
to
whom
the
sepulchre
belonged
were
probably
deposited
on
the
outside
of
these
sepulchres
the
rock
is
cut
away
perpendicularly
above
and
on
both
sides
of
the
door
so
as
to
make
the
exterior
facade
larger
in
general
than
the
interior
apartment
their
most
common
form
is
that
of
a
truncated
pyramid
and
as
they
are
made
to
project
one
or
two
feet
from
the
body
of
the
rock
they
have
the
appearance
when
seen
at
a
distance
of
insulated
structures
on
each
side
of
the
front
is
generally
a
pilaster
and
the
door
is
seldom
without
some
elegant
ornaments
these
fronts
resemble
those
of
several
of
the
tombs
of
palmyra
but
the
latter
are
not
excavated
in
the
rock
but
constructed
with
hewn
stones
i
do
not
think
however
that
there
are
two
sepulchres
in
wady
mousa
perfectly
alike
on
the
contrary
they
vary
greatly
in
size
shape
and
embellishments
in
some
places
three
sepulchres
are
excavated
one
over
the
other
and
the
side
of
the
mountain
is
so
perpendicular
that
it
seems
impossible
to
approach
the
uppermost
no
path
whatever
being
visible
some
of
the
lower
have
a
few
steps
before
their
entrance
in
continuing
a
little
farther
among
the
sepulchres
the
valley
widens
to
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
in
breadth
here
to
the
left
is
a
theatre
cut
entirely
out
of
the
rock
with
all
its
benches
it
may
be
capable
of
containing
about
three
thousand
spectators
its
area
is
now
filled
up
with
gravel
which
the
winter
torrent
brings
down
the
entrance
of
many
of
the
sepulchres
is
in
like
manner
almost
choked
up
there
are
no
remains
of
columns
near
the
theatre
following
the
stream
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
paces
further
the
rocks
open
still
farther
and
i
issued
upon
a
plain
two
hundred
and
fifty
or
three
hundred
yards
across
bordered
by
heights
of
more
gradual
ascent
than
before
here
the
ground
is
covered
with
heaps
of
hewn
stones
foundations
of
buildings
fragments
of
columns
and
vestiges
of
paved
streets
all
clearly
indicating
that
a
large
city
once
existed
here
on
the
left
side
of
the
river
is
a
rising
ground
extending
westwards
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
entirely
covered
with
similar
remains
on
the
right
bank
where
the
ground
is
more
elevated
ruins
of
the
same
description
are
also
seen
in
the
valley
near
the
river
the
buildings
have
probably
been
swept
away
by
the
impetuosity
of
the
winter
torrent
but
even
here
are
still
seen
the
foundations
of
a
temple
and
a
heap
of
broken
columns
close
to
which
is
a
large
birket
or
reservoir
of
water
still
serving
for
the
supply
of
the
inhabitants
during
the
summer
the
finest
sepulchres
in
wady
mousa
are
in
the
eastern
cliff
in
front
of
this
open
space
where
i
counted
upwards
of
fifty
close
to
each
other
high
up
in
the
cliff
i
particularly
observed
one
large
sepulchre
adorned
with
corinthian
pilasters
farther
to
the
west
the
valley
is
shut
in
by
the
rocks
which
extend
in
a
northern
direction
the
river
has
worked
a
passage
through
them
and
runs
underground
as
i
was
told
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
near
the
west
end
of
wady
mousa
are
the
remains
of
a
stately
edifice
of
which
part
of
the
wall
is
still
standing
the
inhabitants
call
it
kaszr
bent
faraoun
arabic
or
the
palace
of
daughter
in
my
way
i
had
entered
several
sepulchres
to
the
surprise
of
my
guide
but
when
he
saw
me
turn
out
of
the
footpath
towards
the
kaszr
he
exclaimed
see
now
clearly
that
you
are
an
infidel
who
have
some
particular
business
amongst
the
ruins
of
the
city
of
your
forefathers
but
depend
upon
it
that
we
shall
not
suffer
you
to
take
out
a
single
para
of
all
the
treasures
hidden
therein
for
they
are
in
our
territory
and
belong
to
i
replied
that
it
was
mere
curiosity
which
prompted
me
to
look
at
the
ancient
works
and
that
i
had
no
other
view
in
coming
here
than
to
sacrifice
to
haroun
but
he
was
not
easily
persuaded
and
i
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
irritate
him
by
too
close
an
inspection
of
the
palace
as
it
might
have
led
him
to
declare
on
our
return
his
belief
that
i
had
found
treasures
which
might
have
led
to
a
search
of
my
person
and
to
the
detection
of
my
journal
which
would
most
certainly
have
been
taken
from
me
as
a
book
of
magic
it
is
very
unfortunate
for
european
travellers
that
the
idea
of
treasures
being
hidden
in
ancient
edifices
is
so
strongly
rooted
in
the
minds
of
the
arabs
and
turks
nor
are
they
satisfied
with
watching
all
the
steps
they
believe
that
it
is
sufficient
for
a
true
magician
to
have
seen
and
observed
the
spot
where
treasures
are
hidden
of
which
he
is
supposed
to
be
already
informed
by
the
old
books
of
the
infidels
who
lived
on
the
spot
in
order
to
be
able
afterwards
at
his
ease
to
command
the
guardian
of
the
treasure
to
set
the
whole
before
him
it
was
of
no
avail
to
tell
them
to
follow
me
and
see
whether
i
searched
for
money
their
reply
was
course
you
will
not
dare
to
take
it
out
before
us
but
we
know
that
if
you
are
a
skilful
magician
you
will
order
it
to
follow
you
through
the
air
to
whatever
place
you
if
the
traveller
takes
the
dimensions
of
a
building
or
a
column
they
are
persuaded
that
it
is
a
magical
proceeding
even
the
most
liberal
minded
turks
of
syria
reason
in
the
same
manner
and
the
more
travellers
they
see
the
stronger
is
their
conviction
that
their
object
is
to
search
for
treasures
arabic
has
indications
of
treasure
with
him
is
an
expression
i
have
heard
a
hundred
times
on
the
rising
ground
to
the
left
of
the
rivulet
just
opposite
to
the
kaszr
bent
faraoun
are
the
ruins
of
a
temple
with
one
column
yet
standing
to
which
the
arabs
have
given
the
name
of
zob
faraoun
arabic
hasta
virilis
pharaonis
it
is
about
thirty
feet
high
and
composed
of
more
than
a
dozen
pieces
from
thence
we
descended
amidst
the
ruins
of
private
habitations
into
a
narrow
lateral
valley
on
the
other
side
of
which
we
began
to
ascend
the
mountain
upon
which
stands
the
tomb
of
aaron
there
are
remains
of
an
ancient
road
cut
in
the
rock
on
both
sides
of
which
are
a
few
tombs
after
ascending
the
bed
of
a
torrent
for
about
half
an
hour
i
saw
on
each
side
of
the
road
a
large
excavated
cube
or
rather
truncated
pyramid
with
the
entrance
of
a
tomb
in
the
bottom
of
each
here
the
number
of
sepulchres
increases
and
there
are
also
excavations
for
the
dead
in
several
natural
caverns
a
little
farther
on
we
reached
a
high
plain
called
szetouh
haroun
arabic
or
terrace
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
upon
which
his
tomb
is
situated
there
are
several
subterranean
sepulchres
in
the
plain
with
an
avenue
leading
to
them
which
is
cut
out
of
the
rocky
surface
the
sun
had
already
set
when
we
arrived
on
the
plain
it
was
too
late
to
reach
the
tomb
and
i
was
excessively
fatigued
i
therefore
hastened
to
kill
the
goat
in
sight
of
the
tomb
at
a
spot
where
i
found
a
number
of
heaps
of
stones
placed
there
in
token
of
as
many
sacrifices
in
honour
of
the
saint
while
i
was
in
the
act
of
slaying
the
animal
my
guide
exclaimed
aloud
haroun
look
upon
us
it
is
for
you
we
slaughter
this
victim
o
haroun
protect
us
and
forgive
us
o
haroun
be
content
with
our
good
intentions
for
it
is
but
a
lean
goat
o
haroun
smooth
our
paths
and
praise
be
to
the
lord
of
all
creatures
arabic
this
he
repeated
several
times
after
which
he
covered
the
blood
that
had
fallen
on
the
ground
with
a
heap
of
stones
we
then
dressed
the
best
part
of
the
flesh
for
our
supper
as
expeditiously
as
possible
for
the
guide
was
afraid
of
the
fire
being
seen
and
of
its
attracting
hither
some
robbers
august
plain
of
haroun
and
the
neighbouring
mountlains
have
no
springs
but
the
rain
water
collects
in
low
grounds
and
in
natural
hollows
in
the
rocks
where
it
partly
remains
the
whole
year
round
even
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
but
this
year
had
been
remarkable
for
its
drought
juniper
trees
grow
here
in
considerable
numbers
i
had
no
great
desire
to
see
the
tomb
of
haroun
which
stands
on
the
summit
of
the
mountain
that
was
opposite
to
us
for
i
had
been
informed
by
several
persons
who
had
visited
it
that
it
contained
nothing
worth
seeing
except
a
large
coffin
like
that
of
osha
in
the
vicinity
of
szalt
my
guide
moreover
insisted
upon
my
speedy
return
as
he
was
to
set
out
the
same
day
with
a
small
caravan
for
maan
i
therefore
complied
with
his
wishes
and
we
returned
by
the
same
road
we
had
come
i
regretted
afterwards
that
i
had
not
visited
tomb
as
i
was
told
that
there
are
several
large
and
handsome
sepulchres
in
the
rock
near
it
a
traveller
ought
if
possible
to
see
every
thing
with
his
own
eyes
for
the
reports
of
the
arabs
are
little
to
be
depended
on
with
regard
to
what
may
be
interesting
in
point
of
antiquity
they
often
extol
things
which
upon
examination
prove
to
be
of
no
kind
of
interest
and
speak
with
indifference
of
those
which
are
curious
and
important
in
a
room
adjoining
the
apartment
in
which
is
the
tomb
of
haroun
there
are
three
copper
vessels
for
the
use
of
those
who
slaughter
the
victims
at
the
tomb
one
is
very
large
and
destined
for
the
boiling
of
the
flesh
of
the
slaughtered
camel
although
there
is
at
present
no
guardian
at
the
tomb
yet
the
arabs
venerate
the
sheikh
too
highly
to
rob
him
of
any
of
his
kitchen
utensils
the
road
from
maan
and
from
wady
mousa
to
ghaza
leads
by
the
tomb
and
is
much
frequented
by
the
people
of
maan
and
the
bedouins
on
the
other
side
of
haroun
the
road
descends
into
the
great
valley
in
comparing
the
testimonies
of
the
authors
cited
in
palaestina
it
appears
very
probable
that
the
ruins
in
wady
mousa
are
those
of
the
ancient
petra
and
it
is
remarkable
that
eusebius
says
the
tomb
of
aaron
was
shewn
near
petra
of
this
at
least
i
am
persuaded
from
all
the
information
i
procured
that
there
is
no
other
ruin
between
the
extremities
of
the
dead
sea
and
red
sea
of
sufficient
importance
to
answer
to
that
city
whether
or
not
i
have
discovered
the
remains
of
the
capital
of
arabia
petræa
i
leave
to
the
decision
of
greek
scholars
and
shall
only
subjoin
a
few
notes
on
these
ruins
the
rocks
through
which
the
river
of
wady
mousa
has
worked
its
extraordinary
passage
and
in
which
all
the
tombs
and
mausolea
of
the
city
have
been
excavated
as
high
as
the
tomb
of
haroun
are
of
a
reddish
colour
the
rocks
above
eldjy
are
calcareous
and
the
does
not
begin
until
the
point
where
the
first
tombs
are
excavated
to
the
southward
the
sandstone
follows
the
whole
extent
of
the
great
valley
which
is
a
continuation
of
the
ghor
the
forms
of
the
summits
of
these
rocks
are
so
irregular
and
grotesque
that
when
seen
from
afar
they
have
the
appearance
of
volcanic
mountains
the
softness
of
the
stone
afforded
great
facilities
to
those
who
excavated
the
sides
of
the
mountains
but
unfortunately
from
the
same
cause
it
is
in
vain
to
look
for
inscriptions
i
saw
several
spots
where
they
had
existed
but
they
are
all
now
obliterated
the
position
of
this
town
was
in
point
of
security
as
a
few
hundred
men
might
defend
the
entrance
to
it
against
a
large
army
but
the
communication
with
the
neighbourhood
must
have
been
subjected
to
great
inconveniences
i
am
not
certain
whether
the
passage
of
the
syk
was
made
use
of
as
a
road
or
whether
the
road
from
the
town
towards
eldjy
was
formed
through
one
of
the
side
valleys
of
the
syk
the
road
westwards
towards
haroun
and
the
valley
below
is
very
difficult
for
beasts
of
burthen
the
summer
heats
must
have
been
excessive
the
situation
being
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
high
barren
cliffs
which
concentrate
the
reflection
of
the
sun
while
they
prevent
the
westerly
winds
from
cooling
the
air
i
saw
nothing
in
the
position
that
could
have
compensated
the
inhabitants
for
these
disadvantages
except
the
river
the
benefit
of
which
might
have
been
equally
enjoyed
had
the
town
been
built
below
eldjy
security
therefore
was
probably
the
only
object
which
induced
the
people
to
overlook
such
objections
and
to
select
such
a
singular
position
for
a
city
the
architecture
of
the
sepulchres
of
which
there
are
at
least
two
hundred
and
fifty
in
the
vicinity
of
the
ruins
are
of
very
different
periods
on
our
return
i
stopped
a
few
hours
at
eldjy
the
town
is
surrounded
with
of
all
kinds
the
produce
of
which
is
of
the
finest
quality
great
quantities
of
the
grapes
are
sold
at
ghaza
and
to
the
bedouins
the
lyathene
cultivate
the
valley
as
far
as
the
first
sepulchres
of
the
ancient
city
in
their
townhouses
they
work
at
the
loom
they
pay
tribute
to
the
howeytat
and
carry
provisions
to
the
syrian
pilgrims
at
maan
and
to
the
egyptian
pilgrims
at
akaba
they
have
three
encampments
of
about
eighty
tents
each
like
the
bedouins
and
other
inhabitants
of
shera
they
have
become
wahabis
but
do
not
at
present
pay
any
tribute
to
the
wahabi
chief
wady
mousa
is
comprised
within
the
territory
of
damascus
as
are
the
entire
districts
of
shera
and
djebal
the
most
southern
frontiers
of
the
pashalik
are
tor
hesma
a
high
mountain
so
called
at
one
journey
north
of
akaba
from
thence
northward
to
kerek
the
whole
country
belongs
to
the
same
pashalik
and
consequently
to
syria
but
it
may
easily
be
conceived
that
the
pasha
has
little
authority
in
these
parts
in
the
time
of
djezzar
the
arabs
of
wady
mousa
paid
their
annual
tax
into
his
treasury
but
no
other
pasha
has
been
able
to
exact
it
i
returned
from
eldjy
to
the
encampment
above
ain
mousa
which
is
considerably
higher
than
the
town
and
set
out
from
thence
immediately
for
i
very
much
disliked
the
people
who
are
less
civil
to
strangers
than
any
other
arabs
in
shera
we
travelled
in
a
southern
direction
along
the
windings
of
a
broad
valley
which
ascends
from
ain
mousa
and
reached
its
summit
at
the
end
of
two
hours
and
a
quarter
the
soil
though
flinty
is
very
capable
of
cultivation
this
valley
is
comprised
within
the
appellation
of
wady
mousa
because
the
rain
water
which
collects
here
joins
in
the
winter
the
torrent
below
eldjy
the
water
was
anciently
conducted
through
this
valley
in
an
artificial
channel
of
which
the
ain
mefrak
stone
walls
remain
in
several
places
at
the
extremity
of
the
wady
are
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
city
called
betahy
arabic
consisting
of
large
heaps
of
hewn
blocks
of
silicious
stone
the
trees
on
this
mountain
are
thinly
scattered
at
a
quarter
of
an
hour
from
betahy
we
reached
an
encampment
composed
of
lyathene
and
naymat
where
we
alighted
and
rested
for
the
night
august
road
lay
in
one
hour
we
came
to
ain
mefrak
arabic
where
are
some
ruins
from
thence
we
ascended
a
mountain
and
continued
along
the
upper
ridge
of
djebel
shera
to
our
right
was
a
tremendous
precipice
on
the
other
side
of
which
runs
the
chain
of
rocks
which
begin
near
wady
mousa
to
the
west
of
these
rocks
we
saw
the
great
valley
forming
the
continuation
of
the
ghor
at
the
end
of
three
hours
after
having
turned
a
little
more
southward
we
arrived
at
a
small
encampment
of
djaylat
arabic
where
we
stopped
to
breakfast
the
bedouin
tents
which
composed
a
great
part
of
this
encampment
were
the
smallest
i
had
ever
seen
they
were
about
four
feet
high
and
ten
in
length
the
inhabitants
were
very
poor
and
could
not
afford
to
give
us
coffee
our
breakfast
or
dinner
therefore
consisted
of
dry
barley
cakes
which
we
dipped
in
melted
grease
the
intelligence
which
i
learnt
here
was
extremely
agreeable
our
landlord
told
us
that
a
caravan
was
to
set
out
in
a
few
days
for
cairo
from
a
neighbouring
encampment
of
howeytat
and
that
they
intended
to
proceed
straight
across
the
desert
this
was
exactly
what
i
wished
for
i
could
not
divest
myself
of
apprehensions
of
danger
in
being
exposed
to
the
undisciplined
soldiers
of
akaba
it
had
been
our
intention
to
reach
akaba
from
hence
in
two
days
by
way
of
the
mountainous
district
of
reszeyfa
a
part
of
shera
so
called
and
djebel
hesma
but
we
now
gladly
changed
our
route
and
departed
for
the
encampment
of
the
howeytat
we
turned
to
the
and
in
half
an
el
szadeke
hour
from
the
djeylat
passed
the
fine
spring
called
el
szadeke
arabic
near
which
is
a
hill
with
extensive
ruins
of
an
ancient
town
consisting
of
heaps
of
hewn
stones
from
thence
we
descended
by
a
slight
declivity
into
the
eastern
plain
and
reached
the
encampment
distant
one
hour
and
a
half
from
szadeke
the
same
immense
plain
which
we
had
entered
in
coming
from
beszeyra
on
the
eastern
borders
of
the
ghoeyr
here
presented
itself
to
our
view
we
were
about
six
hours
of
maan
whose
two
hills
upon
which
the
two
divisions
of
the
town
are
situated
were
distinctly
visible
the
syrian
hadj
route
passes
at
about
one
hour
to
the
east
of
the
encampment
about
eight
hours
of
maan
a
branch
of
the
shera
extends
for
three
or
four
hours
in
an
eastern
direction
across
the
plain
it
is
a
low
hilly
chain
the
mountains
of
shera
are
considerably
elevated
above
the
level
of
the
ghor
but
they
appear
only
as
low
hills
when
seen
from
the
eastern
plain
which
is
upon
a
much
higher
level
than
the
ghor
i
have
already
noticed
the
same
peculiarity
with
regard
to
the
upper
plains
of
el
kerek
and
the
belka
and
it
is
observable
also
in
the
plain
of
djolan
relatively
to
the
level
of
the
lake
of
tiberias
the
valley
of
the
ghor
which
has
a
rapid
slope
southward
from
the
lake
of
tiberias
to
the
dead
sea
appears
to
continue
descending
from
the
southern
extremity
of
the
latter
as
far
as
the
red
sea
for
the
mountains
on
the
of
it
appear
to
increase
in
height
the
farther
we
proceed
southward
while
the
upper
plain
apparently
continues
upon
the
same
level
this
plain
terminates
to
the
near
akaba
on
the
syrian
hadj
route
by
a
steep
rocky
descent
at
the
bottom
of
which
begins
the
desert
of
nedjed
covered
for
the
greater
part
with
flints
the
same
descent
or
cliff
continues
westward
towards
akaba
on
the
egyptian
hadj
road
where
it
joins
the
djebel
hesma
a
prolongation
of
shera
maan
about
eight
hours
to
the
of
the
red
sea
we
have
thus
a
natural
division
of
the
country
which
appears
to
have
been
well
known
to
the
ancients
for
it
is
probably
to
a
part
of
this
upper
plain
together
with
the
mountains
of
shera
djebal
kerek
and
belka
that
the
name
of
arabia
petræa
was
applied
the
western
limits
of
which
must
have
been
the
great
valley
or
ghor
it
might
with
truth
be
called
petræa
not
only
on
account
of
its
rocky
mountains
but
also
of
the
elevated
plain
already
described
which
is
so
much
covered
with
stones
especially
flints
that
it
may
with
great
propriety
be
called
a
stony
desert
although
susceptible
of
culture
in
many
places
it
is
overgrown
with
wild
herbs
and
must
once
have
been
thickly
inhabited
for
the
traces
of
many
ruined
towns
and
villages
are
met
with
on
both
sides
of
the
hadj
road
between
maan
and
akaba
as
well
as
between
maan
and
the
plains
of
haouran
in
which
direction
are
also
many
springs
at
present
all
this
country
is
a
desert
and
maan
arabic
is
the
only
inhabited
place
in
it
all
the
castles
on
the
syrian
hadj
route
from
fedhein
to
medina
are
deserted
at
maan
are
several
springs
to
which
the
town
owes
its
origin
and
these
together
with
the
circumstance
of
its
being
a
station
of
the
syrian
hadj
are
the
cause
of
its
still
existing
the
inhabitants
have
scarcely
any
other
means
of
subsistence
than
the
profits
which
they
gain
from
the
pilgrims
in
their
way
to
and
from
mekka
by
buying
up
all
kinds
of
provisions
at
hebron
and
ghaza
and
selling
them
with
great
profit
to
the
weary
pilgrims
to
whom
the
gardens
and
vineyards
of
maan
are
no
less
agreeable
than
the
wild
herbs
collected
by
the
people
of
maan
are
to
their
camels
the
pomgranates
apricots
and
peaches
of
maan
are
of
the
finest
quality
in
years
when
a
very
numerous
caravan
passes
pomgranates
are
sold
at
one
piastre
each
and
every
thing
in
the
same
proportion
during
the
two
days
stay
of
the
pilgrims
in
going
and
as
many
in
returning
the
people
of
maan
earn
as
much
as
keeps
them
the
whole
year
maan
is
situated
in
the
midst
of
a
rocky
country
not
capable
of
cultivation
the
inhabitants
therefore
depend
upon
their
neighbours
of
djebal
and
shera
for
their
provision
of
wheat
and
barley
at
present
owing
to
the
discontinuance
of
the
syrian
hadj
they
are
scarcely
able
to
obtain
money
to
purchase
it
many
of
them
have
commenced
pedlars
among
the
bedouins
and
fabricators
of
different
articles
for
their
use
especially
furs
while
others
have
emigrated
to
tafyle
and
kerek
the
barbary
pilgrims
who
were
permitted
by
the
wahabi
chief
to
perform
their
pilgrimage
in
and
returned
from
medina
by
the
way
of
maan
and
shobak
to
hebron
jerusalem
and
yaffa
where
they
embarked
for
their
own
country
having
taken
this
circuitous
route
on
account
of
the
hostile
demonstrations
of
mohammed
ali
pasha
on
the
egyptian
road
several
thousands
of
them
died
of
fatigue
before
they
reached
maan
the
people
of
this
town
derived
large
profits
from
the
survivors
and
for
the
transport
of
their
effects
but
it
is
probable
that
if
the
syrian
hadj
is
not
soon
reestablished
the
place
will
in
a
few
years
be
abandoned
the
inhabitants
considering
their
town
as
an
advanced
post
to
the
sacred
city
of
medina
apply
themselves
with
great
eagerness
to
the
study
of
the
koran
the
greater
part
of
them
read
and
write
and
many
serve
in
the
capacity
of
imams
or
secretaries
to
the
great
bedouin
sheikhs
the
two
hills
upon
which
the
town
is
built
divide
the
inhabitants
into
two
parties
almost
incessantly
engaged
in
quarrels
which
are
often
sanguinary
no
individual
of
one
party
even
marries
into
a
family
belonging
to
the
other
on
arriving
at
the
encampment
of
the
howeytat
we
were
informed
that
the
caravan
was
to
set
out
on
the
second
day
i
had
howeytat
encampment
the
advantage
therefore
of
one
repose
i
was
now
reduced
to
that
state
which
can
alone
ensure
tranquillity
to
the
traveller
in
the
desert
having
nothing
with
me
that
could
attract
the
notice
or
excite
the
cupidity
of
the
bedouins
my
clothes
and
linen
were
torn
to
rags
a
dirty
keffye
or
yellow
handkerchief
covered
my
head
my
leathern
girdle
and
shoes
had
long
been
exchanged
by
way
of
present
against
similar
articles
of
an
inferior
kind
so
that
those
i
now
wore
were
of
the
very
worst
sort
the
tube
of
my
pipe
was
reduced
from
two
yards
to
a
span
for
i
had
been
obliged
to
cut
off
from
it
as
much
as
would
make
two
pipes
for
my
friends
at
kerek
and
the
last
article
of
my
baggage
a
pocket
handkerchief
had
fallen
to
the
lot
of
the
sheikh
of
eldjy
having
thus
nothing
more
to
give
i
expected
to
be
freed
from
all
further
demands
but
i
was
mistaken
i
had
forgotten
some
rags
torn
from
my
shirt
which
were
tied
round
my
ancles
wounded
by
the
stirrups
which
i
had
received
in
exchange
from
the
sheikh
of
kerek
these
rags
happening
to
be
of
white
linen
some
of
the
ladies
of
the
howeytat
thought
they
might
serve
to
make
a
berkoa
arabic
or
face
veil
and
whenever
i
stepped
out
of
the
tent
i
found
myself
surrounded
by
half
a
dozen
of
them
begging
for
the
rags
in
vain
i
represented
that
they
were
absolutely
necessary
to
me
in
the
wounded
state
of
my
ancles
their
answer
was
will
soon
reach
cairo
where
you
may
get
as
much
linen
as
you
by
thus
incessantly
teazing
me
they
at
last
obtained
their
wishes
but
in
my
anger
i
gave
the
rags
to
an
ugly
old
woman
to
the
no
slight
disappointment
of
the
young
ones
august
broke
up
in
the
morning
our
caravan
consisting
of
nine
persons
including
myself
and
of
about
twenty
camels
part
of
which
were
for
sale
at
cairo
with
the
rest
the
arabs
expected
to
be
able
to
transport
on
their
return
home
some
provisions
and
to
akaba
where
mohammed
ali
pasha
departure
for
cairo
had
established
a
depot
for
his
arabian
expedition
the
provisions
of
my
companions
consisted
only
of
flour
besides
flour
i
carried
some
butter
and
dried
leben
sour
milk
which
when
dissolved
in
water
forms
not
only
a
refreshing
beverage
but
is
much
to
be
recommended
as
a
preservative
of
health
when
travelling
in
summer
these
were
our
only
provisions
during
the
journey
we
did
not
sup
till
after
sunset
and
we
breakfasted
in
the
morning
upon
a
piece
of
dry
bread
which
we
had
baked
in
the
ashes
the
preceding
evening
without
either
salt
or
leven
the
frugality
of
these
bedouins
is
indeed
without
example
my
companions
who
walked
at
least
five
hours
every
day
supported
themselves
for
four
and
twenty
hours
with
a
piece
of
dry
black
bread
of
about
a
pound
and
a
half
weight
without
any
other
kind
of
nourishment
i
endeavoured
as
much
as
possible
to
imitate
their
abstemiousness
being
already
convinced
from
experience
that
it
is
the
best
preservative
against
the
effects
of
the
fatigues
of
such
a
journey
my
companions
proved
to
be
very
good
natured
people
and
not
a
single
quarrel
happened
during
our
route
except
between
myself
and
my
guide
he
too
was
an
honest
good
tempered
man
but
i
suffered
from
his
negligence
and
rather
from
his
ignorance
of
my
wants
as
an
european
he
had
brought
only
one
with
him
which
was
to
serve
us
both
for
drinking
and
cooking
and
as
we
had
several
intervals
of
three
days
without
meeting
with
water
i
found
myself
on
very
short
allowance
and
could
not
receive
any
assistance
from
my
companions
who
had
scarcely
enough
for
themselves
but
these
people
think
nothing
of
hardships
and
privations
and
take
it
for
granted
that
other
constitutions
are
hardened
to
the
same
aptitude
of
enduring
thirst
and
fatigue
as
their
own
we
returned
to
szadeke
where
we
filled
our
and
proceeded
from
thence
in
a
direction
ascending
the
eastern
djebel
koula
hills
of
djebel
shera
after
two
hours
march
we
began
to
descend
in
following
the
course
of
a
wady
at
the
end
of
four
hours
is
a
spring
called
ibn
reszeysz
arabic
the
highest
point
of
djebel
hesma
in
the
direction
of
akaba
bears
from
hence
hesma
is
higher
than
any
part
of
shera
in
five
hours
we
reached
ain
daleghe
arabic
a
spring
in
a
fertile
valley
where
the
howeytat
have
built
a
few
huts
and
cultivate
some
dhourra
fields
we
continued
descending
wady
daleghe
which
in
winter
is
an
impetuous
torrent
the
mountains
are
quite
barren
here
calcareous
rock
predominates
with
some
flint
at
the
end
of
seven
hours
we
left
the
wady
which
takes
a
more
northern
direction
and
ascended
a
steep
mountain
at
eight
hours
and
a
half
we
alighted
on
the
declivity
of
the
mountain
which
is
called
djebel
koula
arabic
and
which
appears
to
be
the
highest
summit
of
djebel
shera
our
road
was
tolerably
good
all
the
way
august
one
march
we
reached
the
summit
of
djebel
koula
which
is
covered
with
a
chalky
surface
the
descent
on
the
other
side
is
very
wild
the
road
lying
along
the
edges
of
almost
perpendicular
precipices
amidst
large
blocks
of
detached
rocks
down
a
mountain
entirely
destitute
of
vegetation
and
composed
of
calcareous
rocks
and
flint
lying
over
each
other
in
horizontal
layers
at
the
end
of
three
hours
we
came
to
a
number
of
tombs
on
the
road
side
where
the
howeytat
and
other
bedouins
who
encamp
in
these
mountains
bury
their
dead
in
three
hours
and
a
half
we
reached
the
bottom
of
the
mountain
and
entered
the
bed
of
a
winter
torrent
which
like
wady
mousa
has
worked
its
passage
through
the
chain
of
rocks
that
form
a
continuation
of
the
syk
these
rocks
extend
southwards
as
far
as
djebel
hesma
the
narrow
bed
is
enclosed
by
perpendicular
cliffs
which
at
the
entrance
of
the
wady
are
about
fifteen
or
twenty
yards
distant
from
each
other
but
wider
lower
down
wady
gharendel
we
continued
in
a
western
direction
for
an
hour
and
a
half
in
this
wady
which
is
called
gharendel
arabic
at
five
hours
the
valley
opens
and
we
found
ourselves
upon
a
sandy
plain
interspersed
with
rocks
the
bed
of
the
wady
was
covered
with
white
sand
a
few
trees
of
the
species
called
by
the
arabs
talh
tarfa
and
adha
arabic
grow
in
the
midst
of
the
sand
but
their
withered
leaves
can
not
divert
the
eye
from
the
dreary
scene
around
him
at
six
hours
the
valley
again
becomes
narrower
here
are
some
more
tombs
of
bedouins
on
the
side
of
the
road
at
the
end
of
six
hours
and
a
half
we
came
to
the
mouth
of
the
wady
where
it
joins
the
great
lower
valley
issuing
from
the
mountainous
country
into
the
plain
by
a
narrow
passage
formed
by
the
approaching
rocks
these
rocks
are
of
and
contain
many
natural
caverns
a
few
hundred
paces
above
the
issue
of
the
wady
are
several
springs
called
ayoun
gharendel
surrounded
by
a
few
date
trees
and
some
verdant
pasture
ground
the
water
has
a
sulphureous
taste
but
these
being
the
only
springs
on
the
borders
of
the
great
valley
within
one
journey
to
the
and
the
bedouins
are
obliged
to
resort
to
them
the
wells
are
full
of
leeches
some
of
which
fixed
themselves
to
the
palates
of
several
of
our
camels
whilst
drinking
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
we
could
remove
them
the
name
of
arindela
an
ancient
town
of
palæstina
tertia
bears
great
resemblance
to
that
of
gharendel
on
issuing
from
this
rocky
country
which
terminates
the
djebel
shera
on
its
western
side
the
wady
gharendel
empties
itself
into
the
valley
el
araba
in
whose
sands
its
waters
are
lost
this
valley
is
a
continuation
of
the
ghor
which
may
be
said
to
extend
from
the
red
sea
to
the
sources
of
the
jordan
the
valley
of
that
river
widens
about
jericho
and
its
inclosing
hills
are
united
to
a
chain
of
mountains
which
open
and
enclose
the
dead
sea
at
the
southern
wady
el
araba
extremity
of
the
sea
they
again
approach
and
leave
between
them
a
valley
similar
to
the
northern
ghor
in
shape
but
which
the
want
of
water
makes
a
desert
while
the
jordan
and
its
numerous
tributary
streams
render
the
other
a
fertile
plain
in
the
southern
ghor
the
rivulets
which
descend
from
the
eastern
mountains
to
the
of
wady
szafye
or
el
karahy
are
lost
amidst
the
gravel
in
their
winter
beds
before
they
reach
the
valley
below
and
there
are
no
springs
whatever
in
the
western
mountain
the
lower
plain
therefore
in
summer
is
entirely
without
water
which
alone
can
produce
verdure
in
the
arabian
deserts
and
render
them
habitable
the
general
direction
of
the
southern
ghor
is
parallel
to
the
road
which
i
took
in
coming
from
khanzyre
to
wady
mousa
at
the
point
where
we
crossed
it
near
gharendel
its
direction
was
from
to
from
gharendel
it
extends
southwards
for
fifteen
or
twenty
hours
till
it
joins
the
sandy
plain
which
separates
the
mountains
of
hesma
from
the
eastern
branch
of
the
red
sea
it
continues
to
bear
the
appellation
of
el
ghor
as
far
as
the
latitude
of
beszeyra
to
the
of
which
place
as
the
arabs
informed
me
it
is
interrupted
for
a
short
space
by
rocky
ground
and
wadys
and
takes
the
name
of
araba
arabic
which
it
retains
till
its
termination
near
the
red
sea
near
gharendel
where
i
saw
it
the
whole
plain
presented
to
the
view
an
expanse
of
shifting
sands
whose
surface
was
broken
by
innumerable
undulations
and
low
hills
the
sand
appears
to
have
been
brought
from
the
shores
of
the
red
sea
by
the
southerly
winds
and
the
arabs
told
me
that
the
valley
continued
to
present
the
same
appearance
beyond
the
latitude
of
wady
mousa
a
few
talh
trees
arabic
the
acacia
which
produces
the
gum
arable
tarfa
arabic
tamarisk
adha
arabic
and
rethem
arabic
grow
among
the
sand
hills
but
the
depth
of
sand
precludes
all
vegetation
of
herbage
numerous
bedouin
tribes
encamp
here
in
the
winter
when
the
torrents
produce
a
copious
supply
of
water
and
a
few
shrubs
spring
up
upon
their
banks
affording
pasturage
to
the
sheep
and
goats
but
the
camels
prefer
the
leaves
of
the
trees
especially
the
thorny
talh
the
existence
of
the
valley
el
araba
the
kadesh
barnea
perhaps
of
the
scriptures
appears
to
have
been
unknown
both
to
ancient
and
modern
geographers
although
it
forms
a
prominent
feature
in
the
topography
of
syria
and
arabia
petræa
it
deserves
to
be
thoroughly
investigated
and
travellers
might
proceed
along
it
in
winter
time
accompanied
by
two
or
three
bedouin
guides
of
the
tribes
of
howeytat
and
terabein
who
could
be
procured
at
hebron
akaba
or
eziongeber
might
be
reached
in
eight
days
by
the
same
road
by
which
the
communication
was
anciently
kept
up
between
jerusalem
and
her
dependencies
on
the
red
sea
for
this
is
both
the
nearest
and
the
most
commodious
route
and
it
was
by
this
valley
that
the
treasures
of
ophir
were
probably
transported
to
the
warehouses
of
solomon
of
the
towns
which
i
find
laid
down
in
maps
between
zoara
and
aelana
no
traces
remain
thoana
excepted
which
is
the
present
dhana
the
name
of
zoar
is
unknown
to
the
arabs
but
the
village
of
szafye
is
near
that
point
the
river
which
is
made
by
to
fall
into
the
dead
sea
near
zoara
is
the
wady
el
ahhsa
but
it
will
have
been
seen
in
the
above
pages
t
hat
the
course
of
that
wady
is
rather
from
the
east
than
south
i
enquired
in
vain
among
the
arabs
for
the
names
of
those
places
where
the
israelites
had
sojourned
during
their
progress
through
the
desert
none
of
them
are
known
to
the
present
inhabitants
the
country
about
akaba
and
to
the
of
it
might
perhaps
furnish
some
data
for
the
illustration
of
the
jewish
history
i
understand
that
seetzen
went
in
a
straight
line
from
hebron
to
akaba
across
the
desert
el
ty
he
may
perhaps
have
collected
some
interesting
information
on
the

they
are
two
long

journeys
of
ten

twelve
hours
each
at

we
were
one
hour
and
a
half
in
crossing
the
araba
direction
by
in
some
places
the
sand
is
very
deep
but
it
is
firm
and
the
camels
walk
over
it
without
sinking
the
heat
was
suffocating
and
it
was
increased
by
a
hot
wind
from
the
there
is
not
the
slightest
appearance
of
a
road
or
of
any
other
work
of
human
art
in
this
part
of
the
valley
on
the
other
side
we
ascended
the
western
chain
of
mountains
the
mountain
opposite
to
us
appeared
to
be
the
highest
point
of
the
whole
chain
as
far
as
i
could
see
and
it
is
called
djebel
beyane
arabic
the
height
of
this
chain
however
is
not
half
that
of
the
eastern
mountains
it
is
intersected
by
numerous
broad
wadys
in
which
the
talh
tree
grows
the
rock
is
entirely
silicious
of
the
same
species
as
that
of
the
desert
which
extends
from
hence
to
suez
i
saw
some
large
pieces
of
flint
perfectly
oval
three
to
four
feet
in
length
and
about
a
foot
and
a
half
in
breadth
after
an
hour
and
a
half
of
gentle
ascent
we
arrived
at
the
summit
of
the
hills
and
then
descended
by
a
short
and
very
gradual
declivity
into
the
western
plain
the
level
of
which
although
higher
wady
el
lahyane
than
that
of
the
araba
is
perhaps
one
thousand
feet
lower
than
the
eastern
desert
we
had
now
before
us
an
immense
expanse
of
dreary
country
entirely
covered
with
black
flints
with
here
and
there
some
hilly
chains
rising
from
the
plain
about
six
hours
distant
to
our
right
were
the
hills
near
wady
szays
arabic
the
horizon
being
very
clear
near
sunset
my
companions
pointed
out
to
me
the
mountains
of
kerek
which
bore
by
djebel
dhana
bore
by
and
djebel
hesma
i
must
here
observe
that
during
all
my
journeys
in
the
deserts
i
never
allowed
the
arabs
to
get
a
sight
of
my
compass
as
it
would
certainly
have
been
considered
by
them
as
an
instrument
of
magic
when
on
horseback
i
took
the
bearings
unseen
beneath
my
wide
arab
cloak
under
such
circumstances
it
is
an
advantage
to
ride
a
mare
as
she
may
easily
be
taught
to
stand
quite
still
when
mounted
on
a
camel
which
can
never
be
stopped
while
its
companions
are
moving
on
i
was
obliged
to
jump
off
when
i
wished
to
take
a
bearing
and
to
couch
down
in
the
oriental
manner
as
if
answering
a
call
of
nature
the
arabs
are
highly
pleased
with
a
traveller
who
jumps
off
his
beast
and
remounts
without
stopping
it
as
the
act
of
kneeling
down
is
troublesome
and
fatiguing
to
the
loaded
camel
and
before
it
can
rise
again
the
caravan
is
considerably
ahead
from
djebel
beyane
we
continued
in
the
plain
for
upwards
of
an
hour
and
stopped
for
the
night
in
a
wady
which
contains
talh
trees
and
extends
across
the
plain
for
about
half
an
hour
we
had
this
day
marched
eleven
hours
august
the
morning
we
passed
two
broad
wadys
full
of
tamarisks
and
of
talh
trees
which
have
given
to
them
the
name
of
abou
talhha
arabic
at
the
end
of
four
hours
we
reached
wady
el
lahyane
arabic
in
this
desert
the
water
collects
in
a
number
of
low
bottoms

wadys
where
it
produces
verdure
in

an
abundance
of

found
throughout

some
of

camels
might
feed
upon
the
thorny
branches
of
the
gum
arabic
tree
of
which
they
are
extremely
fond
these
poor
people
had
no
tents
with
them
and
their
only
shelter
from
the
burning
rays
of
the
sun
and
the
heavy
dews
of
night
were
the
scanty
branches
of
the
talh
trees
the
ground
was
covered
with
the
large
thorns
of
these
trees
which
are
a
great
annoyance
to
the
bedouins
and
their
cattle
each
bedouin
carries
in
his
girdle
a
pair
of
small
pincers
to
extract
the
thorns
from
his
feet
for
they
have
no
shoes
and
use
only
a
sort
of
sandal
made
of
a
piece
of
skin
tied
on
with
leathern
thongs
in
the
summer
they
collect
the
gum
arabic
arabic
which
they
sell
at
cairo
for
thirty
and
forty
patacks
the
camel
load
or
about
twelve
or
fifteen
shillings
per
cwt
english
but
the
gum
is
of
a
very
inferior
quality
to
that
of
sennaar
my
companions
eat
up
all
the
small
pieces
that
had
been
left
upon
the
trees
by
the
road
side
i
found
it
to
be
quite
tasteless
but
i
was
assured
that
it
was
very
nutritive
we
breakfasted
with
the
arabs
heywat
and
our
people
were
extremely
angry
and
even
insolent
at
not
having
been
treated
with
a
roasted
lamb
according
to
the
promise
of
the
sheikh
who
had
invited
us
to
alight
his
excuse
was
that
he
had
found
none
at
hand
but
one
of
our
young
men
had
overheard
his
wife
scolding
biar
omshash
him
and
declaring
that
she
would
not
permit
a
lamb
to
be
slaughtered
for
such
miserable
strangers
the
bedouin
women
in
general
are
much
less
generous
and
hospitable
than
their
husbands
over
whom
they
often
use
their
influence
to
curtail
the
allowance
to
guests
and
strangers
at
the
end
of
five
hours
we
issued
from
the
head
of
wady
lahyane
again
into
the
plain
the
hill
on
the
top
of
this
wady
is
called
ras
el
kaa
arabic
and
is
the
termination
of
a
chain
of
hills
which
stretch
across
the
plain
in
a
northern
direction
for
six
or
eight
hours
it
projects
like
a
promontory
and
serves
as
a
to
travellers
its
rock
is
calcareous
the
plain
which
we
now
entered
was
a
perfect
flat
covered
with
black
pebbles
the
high
insulated
mountain
behind
which
ghaza
is
situated
bore
from
hence
by
distant
three
long
days
journey
at
the
end
of
seven
hours
there
was
an
insulated
hill
to
the
left
of
our
road
two
hours
distant
called
szoeyka
arabic
we
here
turned
off
to
the
left
of
the
great
road
in
order
to
find
water
in
eight
hours
and
late
at
night
we
reached
several
wells
called
biar
omshash
arabic
is
where
we
found
an
encampment
of
heywat
with
whom
we
wished
to
take
our
supper
after
having
filled
our
water
skins
but
they
assured
us
that
they
had
nothing
except
dry
bread
to
give
us
on
hearing
this
my
companions
began
to
reproach
them
with
want
of
hospitality
and
an
altercation
ensued
which
i
was
afraid
would
lead
to
blows
i
therefore
mounted
my
camel
and
was
soon
followed
by
the
rest
we
continued
our
route
during
the
night
but
lost
our
road
in
the
dark
and
were
obliged
to
alight
in
a
wady
full
of
moving
sands
about
half
an
hour
from
the
wells
august
day
we
passed
several
wadys
of
talh
and
tamarisk
trees
intermixed
with
low
shrubs
direction
by
the
plain
is
for
the
greater
part
covered
with
flints
in
some
places
desert
el
ty
it
is
chalky
wherever
the
rain
collects
in
winter
vegetation
of
trees
and
shrubs
is
produced
in
the
midst
of
this
desert
we
met
a
poor
bedouin
woman
who
begged
some
water
of
us
she
was
going
to
akaba
where
the
tents
of
her
family
were
but
had
neither
provisions
nor
water
with
her
relying
entirely
on
the
hospitality
of
the
arabs
she
might
meet
on
the
road
we
directed
her
to
the
heywat
at
omshash
and
in
wady
lahyane
she
seemed
to
be
as
unconcerned
as
if
she
were
merely
taking
a
walk
for
pleasure
after
an
uninterrupted
march
of
nine
hours
and
a
half
we
reached
a
mountain
called
dharf
el
rokob
arabic
it
extends
for
about
eight
hours
in
a
direction
from
to
at
its
foot
we
crossed
the
egyptian
hadj
road
it
passes
along
the
mountain
towards
akaba
which
is
distant
from
hence
fifteen
or
eighteen
hours
we
ascended
the
northern
extremity
of
the
mountain
by
a
broad
road
and
after
a
march
of
eleven
hours
reached
on
the
other
side
a
well
called
el
themmed
arabic
whose
waters
are
impregnated
with
sulphur
the
pilgrim
caravan
passes
to
the
of
the
mountain
and
well
but
the
arabs
who
have
the
conduct
of
the
caravan
repair
to
the
well
to
fill
the
water
skins
for
the
supply
of
the
hadjis
the
well
is
in
a
sandy
soil
surrounded
by
calcareous
rocks
and
notwithstanding
its
importance
nothing
has
been
done
to
secure
it
from
being
choaked
up
by
the
sand
and
gravel
which
every
gust
of
wind
drives
into
it
its
sides
are
not
lined
and
the
arabs
take
so
little
care
in
descending
into
it
that
every
caravan
which
arrives
renders
it
immediately
turbid
the
level
plain
over
which
we
had
travelled
from
ras
el
kaa
terminates
at
dharf
el
rokob
westward
of
it
the
ground
is
more
intersected
by
hills
and
wadys
and
here
begins
the
desert
el
ty
arabic
in
which
according
to
tradition
both
jewish
and
mohammedan
the
israelites
wandered
for
several
years
and
from
which
odjme
belief
the
desert
takes
its
name
we
went
this
evening
two
hours
farther
than
the
themmed
and
alighted
in
the
wady
ghoreyr
arabic
after
a
march
of
thirteen
hours
and
a
half
the
bedouins
when
travelling
in
small
numbers
seldom
alight
at
a
well
or
spring
in
the
evening
for
the
purpose
of
there
passing
the
night
they
only
fill
their
as
quickly
as
possible
and
then
proceed
on
their
way
for
the
neighbourhood
of
watering
places
is
dangerous
to
travellers
especially
in
deserts
where
there
are
few
of
them
because
they
then
become
the
rendezvous
of
all
strolling
parties
august
issuing
from
the
wady
ghoreyr
we
passed
a
chain
of
hills
called
odjme
arabic
running
almost
parallel
with
the
dharf
el
rokob
we
had
now
the
hadj
route
a
broad
well
trodden
road
strewn
with
the
whitened
bones
of
animals
that
have
died
by
the
way
the
soil
is
chalky
and
overspread
with
black
pebbles
at
the
end
of
five
hours
and
a
half
we
reached
wady
rouak
arabic
here
the
term
wady
is
applied
to
a
narrow
strip
of
ground
the
bed
of
a
winter
torrent
not
more
than
one
foot
lower
than
the
level
of
the
plain
where
the
rain
water
from
the
inequalities
of
the
surface
collects
and
produces
a
vegetation
of
low
shrubs
and
a
few
talh
trees
the
greater
part
of
the
wadys
from
hence
to
egypt
are
of
this
description
the
coloquintida
grows
in
great
abundance
in
all
of
them
it
is
used
by
the
arabs
to
make
tinder
by
the
following
process
after
roasting
the
root
in
the
ashes
they
wrap
it
in
a
wetted
rag
of
cotton
cloth
they
then
beat
it
between
two
stones
by
which
means
the
juice
of
the
fruit
is
expressed
and
absorbed
by
the
rag
which
is
dyed
by
it
of
a
dirty
blue
the
rag
is
then
dried
in
the
sun
and
ignites
with
the
slightest
spark
of
fire
the
arabs
nearest
to
egypt
use
the
coloquint
in
venereal
complaints
they
fill
the
fruit
with
milk
roast
it
over
the
fire
and
then
give
to
the
patient
the
milk
thus
impregnated
with
the
essence
of
the
fruit
in
nine
hours
and
a
half
we
passed
a
chain
of
low
chalky
hills
called
ammayre
arabic
on
several
parts
of
the
road
were
holes
out
of
which
rock
salt
had
been
dug
at
the
end
of
ten
hours
and
a
half
we
arrived
in
the
vicinity
of
nakhel
a
fortified
station
of
the
egyptian
hadj
situated
about
half
an
hour
to
the
of
the
road
our
direction
was
still
by
nakhel
stands
in
a
plain
which
extends
to
an
immense
distance
southward
but
which
terminates
to
the
at
about
one
distance
from
nakhel
in
a
low
chain
of
mountains
the
fortress
is
a
large
square
building
with
stone
walls
without
any
habitations
round
it
there
is
a
well
of
brackish
water
and
a
large
birket
which
is
filled
from
the
well
in
the
time
of
the
hadj
the
pasha
of
egypt
keeps
a
garrison
in
nakhel
of
about
fifty
soldiers
and
uses
it
as
a
magazine
for
the
provisions
of
his
army
in
his
expedition
against
the
wahabi
the
appellation
nakhel
was
probably
given
to
this
castle
at
a
time
when
the
adjacent
country
was
covered
with
palm
trees
none
of
which
are
now
to
be
seen
here
at
akaba
on
the
contrary
are
large
forests
of
them
belonging
for
the
greater
part
to
the
arabs
heywat
the
ground
about
nakhel
is
chalky
or
sandy
and
is
covered
with
loose
pebbles
we
passed
along
the
road
as
quickly
as
we
could
for
my
companions
were
afraid
lest
their
camels
should
be
stopped
by
the
aga
of
nakhel
to
transport
provisions
to
akaba
the
arabs
heywat
and
sowadye
who
encamp
in
this
district
style
themselves
masters
of
akaba
and
nakhel
and
exact
yearly
from
the
pasha
certain
sums
for
permitting
him
to
occupy
them
for
though
they
are
totally
unable
to
oppose
his
troops
yet
the
tribute
is
paid
in
order
to
take
from
them
all
pretext
for
plundering
small
caravans
nakhel
about
six
hours
to
the
of
nakhel
is
a
chain
of
mountains
called
szadder
arabic
extending
in
a
direction
near
nakhel
my
arab
companions
fell
in
with
an
acquaintance
who
was
burning
charcoal
for
the
cairo
market
he
informed
us
that
a
large
party
of
arabs
sowaleha
with
whom
my
howeytats
were
at
war
was
encamped
in
this
vicinity
it
was
in
consequence
determined
to
travel
by
night
until
we
should
be
out
of
their
reach
and
we
stopped
at
sunset
about
one
hour
west
of
nakhel
after
a
march
of
eleven
hours
and
a
half
merely
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
the
camels
to
eat
being
ourselves
afraid
to
light
a
fire
lest
it
should
be
descried
by
the
sowaleha
we
were
obliged
to
take
a
supper
of
dry
flour
mixed
with
a
little
salt
during
the
whole
of
the
journey
the
camels
had
no
other
provender
than
the
withered
shrubs
of
the
desert
my
dromedary
excepted
to
which
i
gave
a
few
handfuls
of
barley
every
evening
loaded
camels
are
scarcely
able
to
perform
such
a
journey
without
a
daily
allowance
of
beans
and
barley
august
set
out
before
midnight
and
continued
at
a
quick
rate
the
whole
night
in
these
northern
districts
of
arabia
the
bedouins
in
general
are
not
fond
of
proceeding
by
night
they
seldom
travel
at
that
time
even
in
the
hottest
season
if
they
are
not
in
very
large
numbers
because
as
they
say
during
the
night
nobody
can
distinguish
the
face
of
his
friend
from
that
of
his
enemy
another
reason
is
that
camels
on
the
march
never
feed
at
their
ease
in
the
day
time
and
nature
seems
to
require
that
they
should
have
their
principal
meal
and
a
few
hours
rest
in
the
evening
the
favourite
mode
of
travelling
in
these
parts
is
to
set
out
about
two
hours
before
to
stop
two
hours
at
noon
when
every
one
endeavours
to
sleep
under
his
mantle
and
to
alight
for
the
evening
at
about
one
hour
before
sunset
we
always
sat
round
the
fire
in
conversation
for
two
or
three
hours
after
supper
during
this
march
my
companions
frequently
alluded
to
el
theghar
a
superstitious
belief
among
the
bedouins
that
the
desert
is
inhabited
by
invisible
female
demons
who
carry
off
travellers
tarrying
in
the
rear
of
the
caravans
in
order
to
enjoy
their
embraces
they
call
them
om
megheylan
arabic
from
ghoul
arabic
the
frequent
loss
of
men
who
exhausted
by
fatigue
loiter
behind
the
great
pilgrim
caravans
and
are
cut
off
stripped
and
abandoned
by
bedouin
robbers
may
have
given
rise
to
this
fable
which
afforded
my
companions
a
subject
of
numerous
jokes
against
me
townsmen
said
they
be
exquisite
morsels
for
these
ladies
who
are
accustomed
only
to
the
food
of
the
we
marched
for
four
hours
over
uneven
ground
and
then
reached
a
level
plain
consisting
of
rich
red
earth
fit
for
culture
and
similar
to
that
of
the
northern
syrian
desert
we
crossed
several
wadys
in
which
we
started
a
number
of
hares
at
every
twenty
yards
lay
heaps
of
bones
of
camels
horses
and
asses
by
the
side
of
the
road
at
six
hours
was
a
chain
of
low
hills
to
the
of
the
road
and
running
parallel
with
it
in
seven
hours
we
crossed
wady
nesyl
arabic
overgrown
with
green
shrubs
but
without
trees
at
the
end
of
ten
hours
and
a
half
we
reached
the
mountainous
country
called
el
theghar
arabic
or
the
mouths
which
forms
a
boundary
of
the
desert
el
ty
and
separates
it
from
the
peninsula
of
mount
sinai
we
ascended
for
half
an
hour
by
a
well
formed
road
cut
in
several
places
in
the
rock
and
then
followed
the
windings
of
a
valley
in
the
bed
of
a
winter
torrent
gradually
descending
on
both
sides
of
the
hadj
road
we
saw
numerous
heaps
of
stones
the
tombs
of
pilgrims
who
had
died
of
fatigue
among
others
is
shewn
that
of
a
woman
who
here
died
in
labour
and
whose
infant
was
carried
the
whole
way
to
mekka
and
back
to
cairo
in
good
health
at
the
end
of
fifteen
hours
we
alighted
in
a
valley
of
the
theghar
where
we
found
an
abundance
of
shrubs
and
trees
mabouk
september
continued
descending
among
the
windings
of
the
wady
turning
a
little
to
the
southward
of
the
hadj
route
among
the
calcareous
hills
of
the
wady
deep
sands
have
accumulated
which
have
been
blown
thither
from
the
shores
of
the
red
sea
and
in
several
parts
there
are
large
insulated
rocks
of
porous
tufwacke
after
a
march
of
four
hours
and
a
half
we
had
a
fine
view
of
the
sea
and
gained
the
plain
which
extends
to
its
shores
and
which
is
apparently
much
below
the
level
of
the
desert
el
ty
it
is
covered
with
moving
sands
among
which
a
few
low
shrubs
grow
the
direction
of
our
route
was
in
seven
hours
we
reached
the
wells
of
mabouk
arabic
to
our
great
satisfaction
as
we
had
not
a
drop
of
water
left
in
our
skins
these
wells
are
in
the
open
plain
at
the
foot
of
some
rocks
good
water
but
in
small
quantities
is
found
every
where
on
digging
to
the
depth
of
ten
or
twelve
feet
there
were
about
half
a
dozen
holes
five
or
six
feet
in
circumference
with
a
foot
of
water
in
each
on
drawing
up
the
water
the
holes
fill
again
immediately
we
here
met
some
shepherds
of
the
maazye
a
tribe
of
bedouins
of
the
desert
between
egypt
and
the
red
sea
who
were
busy
in
watering
a
large
herd
of
camels
they
were
so
kind
as
to
make
room
for
us
in
consideration
of
our
being
strangers
and
travellers
and
we
were
occupied
several
hours
in
drawing
up
water
these
wells
were
filled
up
last
year
by
the
moggrebyn
hadj
on
its
passage
to
revenge
themselves
upon
mohammed
ali
with
whose
treatment
they
were
dissatisfied
the
egyptian
pilgrims
take
a
more
northern
route
but
the
arabs
who
accompany
them
fill
the
water
skins
for
the
use
of
the
caravan
at
these
wells
and
rejoin
the
hadj
by
the
route
we
travelled
this
morning
near
the
wells
are
the
ruins
of
a
small
building
with
strong
walls
which
was
probably
constructed
for
the
defence
of
the
water
when
the
hadj
was
still
in
its
ancient
splendour
adjeroud
on
quitting
the
wells
we
turned
off
in
the
direction
of
suez
our
route
lying
there
are
no
traces
of
a
road
here
for
the
track
of
caravans
is
immediately
filled
up
by
the
moving
sands
which
covered
the
plain
as
far
as
i
could
discern
and
in
some
places
had
collected
into
hills
thirty
or
forty
feet
in
height
at
ten
hours
from
our
setting
out
in
the
morning
we
entered
a
plain
covered
with
flints
and
again
fell
in
with
the
hadj
road
here
we
took
a
by
direction
at
the
end
of
eleven
hours
the
plain
was
covered
with
a
saline
crust
and
we
crossed
a
tract
of
ground
about
five
minutes
in
breadth
covered
with
such
a
quantity
of
small
white
shells
that
it
appeared
at
a
distance
like
a
strip
of
salt
shells
of
the
same
species
are
found
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
of
tiberias
once
probably
the
sea
covered
the
whole
of
this
ground
at
twelve
hours
and
a
half
suez
bore
about
an
hour
and
an
half
distant
from
us
to
our
right
we
saw
marshy
ground
extending
northwards
which
the
people
informed
me
was
full
of
salt
it
is
called
like
all
salt
marshes
szabegha
arabic
at
the
end
of
thirteen
hours
we
crossed
a
low
and
narrow
wady
perhaps
the
remains
of
the
canal
of
ptolemy
and
at
fourteen
hours
and
a
half
alighted
in
wady
redjel
arabic
where
there
were
many
talh
trees
and
plenty
of
food
for
our
camels
september
continued
to
travel
over
the
plain
route
by
in
two
hours
we
reached
adjeroud
arabic
an
ancient
castle
which
has
lately
been
completely
repaired
by
mohammed
ali
who
keeps
a
garrison
here
there
are
two
separate
buildings
the
largest
of
which
is
occupied
by
the
soldiers
and
the
smaller
contains
a
mosque
with
the
tomb
of
a
saint
they
are
both
defended
by
strong
walls
against
any
attack
of
the
arabs
here
is
also
a
copious
well
but
the
water
is
very
bitter
and
can
be
used
only
for
watering
camels
the
garrison
is
supplied
from
the
wells
of
mousa
opposite
to
suez
our
road
was
full
of
the
aromatic
wady
mousa
herb
baytheran
arabic
which
is
sold
by
the
arabs
at
ghaza
and
hebron
beyond
adjeroud
many
wadys
cross
the
plain
to
the
left
we
had
the
chain
of
mountains
called
attaka
at
the
end
of
five
hours
and
about
one
hour
to
the
right
of
the
road
begins
the
chain
of
low
mountains
called
oweybe
arabic
running
parallel
with
the
attaka
our
route
lay
by
at
eight
hours
the
attaka
terminated
on
our
left
and
was
succeeded
by
a
ridge
of
low
hills
the
plain
here
is
sandy
covered
with
black
flints
we
again
passed
several
wadys
and
met
two
large
caravans
transporting
a
corps
of
infantry
to
suez
at
the
end
of
ten
hours
and
a
half
we
stopped
in
wady
djaafar
arabic
which
is
full
of
low
trees
shrubs
and
dry
herbs
from
hence
a
hilly
chain
extends

a
march
of
six
hours
along
the
plain
the
ground
began
to
be
overspread
with
egyptian
pebbles
route
we
passed
several
wadys
similar
to
those
mentioned
above
when
describing
wady
rowak
at
nine
hours
we
descried
the
nile
with
its
beautiful
verdant
shores
at
eleven
hours
began
a
hilly
tract
the
last
undulations
of
djebel
makattam
and
in
thirteen
hours
and
a
half
we
reached
the
vicinity
of
cairo
here
my
arab
companions
left
me
and
proceeded
to
belbeis
where
they
were
informed
their
principal
men
were
encamped
waiting
for
orders
to
proceed
to
akaba
i
discharged
my
honest
guide
hamd
ibn
hamdan
who
was
not
a
little
astonished
to
see
me
take
some
sequins
out
of
the
skirts
of
my
gown
as
it
was
too
late
to
enter
the
town
i
went
to
some
bedouin
tents
which
i
saw
at
a
distance
and
entered
one
of
them
in
which
for
the
first
time
i
drank
of
the
sweet
water
of
the
nile
here
i
remained
all
night
a
great
number
of
bedouins
were
at
this
time
collected
near
cairo
to
accompany
the
troops
which
were
to
be
sent
into
arabia
after
the
ramadhan
cairo
september
entered
cairo
before
sunrise
and
thus
concluded
my
journey
by
the
blessing
of
god
without
either
loss
of
health
or
exposure
to
any
imminent
danger
journal
of
a
tour
in
the
peninsula
of
mount
sinai
in
the
spring
of
about
the
beginning
of
april
cairo
was
again
visited
by
the
plague
the
franks
and
most
of
the
christians
shut
themselves
up
but
as
i
neither
wished
to
follow
their
example
nor
to
expose
myself
unnecessarily
in
the
town
i
determined
to
pass
my
time
during
the
prevalence
of
the
disease
among
the
bedouins
of
mount
sinai
to
visit
the
gulf
of
akaba
and
if
possible
the
castle
of
akaba
to
which
as
far
as
i
know
no
traveller
has
ever
penetrated
intending
to
pass
some
days
at
the
convent
of
mount
sinai
i
procured
a
letter
of
introduction
to
the
monks
from
their
brethren
at
cairo
for
without
this
passport
no
stranger
is
ever
permitted
to
enter
the
convent
i
was
also
desirous
of
having
a
letter
from
the
pasha
of
egypt
to
the
principal
sheikh
of
the
tribes
of
tor
over
whom
as
i
knew
by
former
experience
he
exercises
more
than
a
nominal
authority
with
the
assistance
of
this
paper
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
see
a
good
deal
of
the
bedouins
of
the
peninsula
in
safety
and
to
travel
in
their
company
to
akaba
such
letters
of
recommendation
are
in
general
easily
procured
in
syria
and
egypt
though
they
are
often
useless
as
i
found
on
several
occasions
during
my
first
journey
into
nubia
as
well
as
in
my
kayt
beg
travels
in
syria
where
the
orders
of
the
pasha
of
damascus
were
much
slighted
in
several
of
the
districts
under
his
dominion
a
fortnight
before
i
set
out
for
mount
sinai
i
had
applied
to
the
pasha
through
his
dragoman
for
a
letter
to
the
bedouin
sheikh
but
i
was
kept
waiting
for
it
day
after
day
and
after
thus
delaying
my
departure
a
whole
week
i
was
at
last
obliged
to
set
off
without
it
the
want
of
it
was
the
cause
of
some
embarrassment
to
me
and
prevented
me
from
reaching
akaba
it
is
not
improbable
that
on
being
applied
to
for
the
letter
the
pasha
gave
the
same
answer
as
he
gave
at
tayf
when
i
asked
him
for
a
firmahn
namely
that
as
i
was
sufficiently
acquainted
with
the
language
and
manners
of
the
arabs
i
needed
no
further
recommendation
the
arabs
of
mount
sinai
usually
alight
at
cairo
in
the
quarter
called
el
djemelye
where
some
of
them
are
almost
constantly
to
be
found
having
gone
thither
i
met
with
the
same
bedouin
with
whom
i
had
come
last
year
from
tor
to
cairo
i
hired
two
camels
from
him
for
myself
and
servant
and
laid
in
provisions
for
about
six
weeks
consumption
we
left
cairo
on
the
evening
of
the
of
april
and
slept
that
night
among
the
ruined
tombs
of
the
village
called
kayt
beg
a
mile
from
the
city
from
this
village
at
which
the
bedouins
usually
alight
the
caravans
for
suez
often
depart
it
is
also
the
resort
of
smugglers
from
suez
and
syria
april
set
out
from
kayt
beg
in
the
course
of
the
morning
in
the
company
of
a
caravan
bound
for
suez
comprising
about
twenty
camels
some
of
which
belonged
to
moggrebyn
pilgrims
who
had
come
by
sea
from
tunis
to
alexandria
the
others
to
a
hedjaz
merchant
and
to
the
bedouins
of
mount
sinai
who
had
brought
passengers
from
suez
to
cairo
and
were
now
returning
with
corn
to
their
mountains
as
i
knew
the
character
of
these
bedouins
by
former
experience
and
that
the
road
was
perfectly
derb
el
ankabye
safe
at
least
as
far
as
the
convent
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
this
time
to
travel
in
the
disguise
of
a
pauper
some
few
comforts
may
be
enjoyed
in
the
desert
even
by
those
who
do
not
travel
with
tents
and
servants
and
whenever
these
comforts
must
be
relinquished
it
becomes
a
very
irksome
task
to
cross
a
desert
as
i
fully
experienced
during
several
of
my
preceding
journeys
the
bedouins
of
sinai
or
as
they
are
more
usually
denominated
the
towara
or
bedouins
of
tor
formerly
enjoyed
the
exclusive
privilege
of
transporting
goods
provisions
and
passengers
from
cairo
to
suez
and
the
route
was
wholly
under
their
protection
since
the
increased
power
of
the
pasha
of
egypt
it
has
been
thrown
open
to
of
all
descriptions
egyptian
peasants
as
well
as
syrian
and
arabian
bedouins
and
as
the
egyptian
camels
are
much
stronger
for
a
short
journey
than
those
of
the
desert
the
bedouins
of
mount
sinai
have
lost
the
greater
part
of
their
custom
and
the
transport
trade
in
this
route
is
now
almost
wholly
in
the
hands
of
the
egyptian
carriers
the
hire
of
a
strong
camel
from
cairo
to
suez
was
at
this
time
about
six
or
eight
patacks
from
one
and
a
half
to
two
spanish
dollars
the
desert
from
cairo
to
suez
is
crossed
by
different
routes
we
followed
that
generally
taken
by
the
towara
which
lies
between
the
great
hadj
route
and
the
more
southern
one
close
along
the
mountains
the
latter
is
pursued
only
by
the
arabs
terabein
and
other
syrian
bedouins
the
route
we
took
is
called
derb
el
ankabye
arabic
we
proceeded
on
a
gentle
ascent
from
kayt
beg
and
passed
on
the
right
several
low
quarries
in
the
horizontal
layers
of
soft
calcareous
stone
of
which
the
mountain
of
mokattam
in
the
neighbourhood
of
cairo
is
composed
it
is
with
this
stone
that
the
splendid
mamelouk
tombs
of
kayt
beg
are
built
at
the
end
of
el
mogawa
an
hour
the
limestone
terminated
and
the
road
was
covered
with
flints
petrosilex
and
egyptian
pebbles
here
are
also
found
specimens
of
petrified
wood
the
largest
about
a
foot
in
length
we
now
travelled
eastward
and
after
a
march
of
three
hours
halted
upon
a
part
of
the
plain
called
el
mogawa
arabic
where
we
rested
during
the
heat
beyond
this
spot
to
the
distance
of
five
hours
from
cairo
we
met
with
great
quantities
of
petrified
wood
large
pieces
of
the
trunks
of
trees
three
or
four
feet
in
length
and
eight
or
ten
inches
in
diameter
lay
about
the
plain
and
close
to
the
road
was
an
entire
trunk
of
a
tree
at
least
twenty
feet
in
length
half
buried
in
sand
these
petrifactions
are
generally
found
in
low
grounds
but
i
saw
several
also
on
the
top
of
the
low
hills
of
gravel
and
sand
over
which
the
road
lies
several
travellers
have
expressed
doubts
of
their
being
really
petrified
wood
and
some
have
crossed
the
desert
without
meeting
with
any
of
them
the
latter
circumstance
is
easily
accounted
for
the
route
we
were
travelling
is
not
that
usually
taken
to
suez
i
have
crossed
this
desert
repeatedly
in
other
directions
and
never
saw
any
of
the
petrifactions
except
in
this
part
of
it
as
to
its
really
being
petrified
wood
there
can
not
be
any
reason
to
doubt
it
after
an
inspection
of
the
substance
in
which
the
texture
and
fibres
of
the
wood
are
clearly
distinguishable
and
perfectly
resemble
those
of
the
date
tree
i
think
it
not
improbable
that
before
nechos
dug
the
canal
between
the
nile
and
the
red
sea
the
communication
between
arsinoe
or
clysma
and
memphis
may
have
been
carried
on
this
way
and
stations
may
have
been
established
on
the
spots
now
covered
by
these
petrified
trees
the
water
requisite
to
produce
and
maintain
vegetation
might
have
been
procured
from
deep
wells
or
from
reservoirs
of
rain
water
as
is
done
in
the
equally
barren
desert
between
djidda
and
mekka
after
the
completion
of
the
canal
this
route
was
perhaps
neglected
the
trees
left
without
a
el
mograh
regular
supply
of
water
dried
up
and
fell
and
the
sands
with
the
winter
rains
and
torrents
gradually
effected
the
petrifaction
i
have
seen
specimens
of
the
petrified
wood
of
date
trees
found
in
the
libyan
desert
beyond
the
bahr
bala
ma
where
they
were
observed
by
horneman
in
and
in
by
boutin
a
french
officer
who
brought
several
of
them
to
cairo
they
resemble
precisely
those
which
i
saw
on
the
suez
road
in
colour
substance
and
texture
some
of
them
are
of
silex
in
others
the
substance
seems
to
approach
to
hornblende
we
continued
our
route
by
over
an
uneven
and
somewhat
hilly
country
covered
with
black
petrosilex
and
after
a
march
of
eight
hours
and
a
quarter
we
halted
in
a
valley
of
little
depth
called
wady
onszary
arabic
where
our
camels
found
good
pasture
close
by
are
some
low
hills
where
the
sands
are
seen
in
the
state
of
formation
into
rock
and
presenting
all
the
different
gradations
between
their
loose
state
and
the
solid
stone
i
saw
a
great
quantity
of
petrified
wood
upon
one
of
these
hills
amongst
which
was
the
entire
trunk
of
a
date
tree
april
onszary
we
travelled
by
for
one
hour
and
then
at
the
end
of
three
hours
the
hilly
country
terminates
beyond
which
in
this
route
no
petrified
wood
is
met
with
we
then
entered
upon
a
widely
extended
and
entirely
level
plain
called
by
the
bedouins
el
mograh
arabic
upon
which
we
rested
after
a
march
of
five
hours
and
a
half
while
we
were
preparing
our
dinner
two
ostriches
approached
near
enough
to
be
distinctly
seen
a
shot
fired
by
one
of
the
arabs
frightened
them
and
in
an
instant
they
were
out
of
sight
these
birds
come
into
this
plain
from
the
eastward
from
the
desert
of
tyh
but
i
never
heard
that
the
bedouins
of
this
country
take
the
trouble
of
hunting
them
the
plain
of
mograh
is
famous
for
the
skirmishes
which
have
taken
place
there
for
the
caravans
that
have
been
plundered
in
dar
el
hamra
crossing
it
and
for
the
number
of
travellers
that
have
been
murdered
on
it
in
former
times
when
this
desert
was
constantly
run
by
parties
of
robbers
the
mograh
was
always
chosen
by
them
as
their
point
of
attack
because
in
the
event
of
success
no
one
could
escape
them
on
a
plain
where
objects
can
be
distinguished
in
every
direction
to
the
distance
of
several
hours
even
at
present
since
the
route
has
been
made
more
secure
by
the
vigilance
of
the
pasha
of
cairo
robberies
sometimes
happen
and
in
the
autumn
of
a
rich
caravan
was
plundered
by
the
arabs
terabein
these
arabs
under
their
sheikh
abou
djehame
arabic
made
an
excursion
about
the
same
time
over
the
mountains
towards
cosseir
and
plundered
a
caravan
of
pilgrims
and
merchants
who
were
going
to
kenne
the
sheikh
was
seized
on
his
return
by
the
maazy
tribe
and
carried
to
cairo
where
he
remained
a
year
in
close
confinement
and
after
having
delivered
part
of
his
booty
into
the
treasury
of
the
pasha
was
released
a
few
days
before
i
set
out
the
desert
of
suez
is
never
inhabited
by
bedouin
encampments
though
it
is
full
of
rich
pasture
and
pools
of
water
during
winter
and
spring
no
strong
tribes
frequent
the
eastern
borders
of
egypt
and
a
weak
insulated
encampment
would
soon
be
stripped
of
its
property
by
nightly
robbers
the
ground
itself
is
the
patrimony
of
no
tribe
but
is
common
to
all
which
is
contrary
to
the
general
practice
of
the
desert
where
every
district
has
its
acknowledged

its
limits
of
separation
from
those
of
the
neighbouring
tribes
although
it
is
not
always
occupied
by
them
in
the
afternoon
we
proceeded
over
the
plain
and
in
eight
hours
and
three
quarters
arrived
opposite
to
the
station
of
the
hadj
called
dar
el
hamra
which
we
left
about
three
miles
to
the
north
of
us
and
which
is
distinguished
by
a
large
acacia
tree
the
only
one
in
this
plain
at
the
end
of
nine
hours
and
a
half
and
about
half
an
hour
from
the
road
we
saw
a
mound
of
earth
which
wady
emshash
the
arabs
told
me
was
thrown
up
about
fifty
years
ago
by
workmen
employed
by
ali
beg
then
governor
of
egypt
in
digging
a
well
there
the
ground
was
dug
to
the
depth
of
about
eighty
feet
when
no
water
appearing
the
work
was
abandoned
at
eleven
hours
and
a
quarter
our
road
joined
the
great
hadj
route
which
passes
in
a
more
northerly
direction
from
dar
el
hamra
to
the
birket
el
hadj
or
inundation
to
the
eastward
of
heliopolis
four
hours
distant
from
cairo
upon
the
banks
of
which
the
pilgrims
encamp
previous
to
their
setting
out
for
mekka
between
this
road
and
that
by
which
we
had
travelled
lies
another
also
terminating
at
kayt
beg
the
southernmost
route
which
as
i
have
already
mentioned
is
frequented
only
by
the
arabs
terabein
branches
off
from
this
common
route
at
about
six
hours
distant
from
suez
and
is
called
harb
bela
ma
the
road
without
water
it
is
very
seldom
frequented
by
regular
caravans
being
hilly
and
longer
than
the
others
but
i
was
told
that
notwithstanding
its
name
water
is
frequently
met
with
in
the
low
grounds
even
in
summer
just
beyond
where
we
fell
in
with
the
hadj
route
we
rested
in
the
bed
of
a
torrent
called
wady
hafeiry
arabic
at
the
foot
of
a
chain
of
hills
which
begin
there
and
extend
to
the
of
the
route
and
parallel
with
it
towards
adjeroud
our
camels
found
abundance
of
pasture
on
the
odoriferous
herb
obeitheran
arabic
santolina
fragrantissima
of
forskal
which
grew
here
in
great
plenty
april
road
lay
between
the
southern
mountain
and
the
abovementioned
chain
of
hills
to
the
north
called
djebel
uweybe
arabic
direction
in
three
hours
we
passed
the
bed
of
a
torrent
called
seil
abou
zeid
arabic
where
some
acacia
trees
grow
the
road
is
here
encompassed
on
every
side
by
hills
in
four
hours
and
a
half
we
reached
in
the
direction
by
wady
emshash
arabic
a
torrent
like
the
former
which
in
winter
is
filled
by
a
stream
of
several
feet
in
depth
bir
suez
rains
are
much
more
frequent
in
this
desert
than
in
the
valley
of
egypt
and
the
same
remark
may
be
made
in
regard
to
all
the
mountains
to
the
southward
where
a
regular
though
not
uninterrupted
rainy
season
sets
in
while
in
the
valley
of
the
nile
as
is
well
known
rain
seldom
falls
even
in
winter
the
soil
and
hills
are
here
entirely
calcareous
we
had
been
for
the
whole
morning
somewhat
alarmed
by
the
appearance
of
some
suspicious
looking
men
on
camels
at
a
distance
in
our
rear
and
our
bedouins
had
in
consequence
prepared
their
matchlocks
when
we
halted
during
the
hours
they
also
alighted
upon
a
hill
at
a
little
distance
but
seeing
us
in
good
order
and
with
no
heavy
loads
to
excite
their
cupidity
they
did
not
approach
us
they
however
this
evening
fell
upon
a
small
party
of
unarmed
egyptian
peasants
who
were
carrying
corn
to
suez
stripped
them
took
away
their
camels
and
loads
and
the
poor
owners
fled
naked
into
suez
it
was
afterwards
learnt
that
they
belonged
to
the
tribe
of
omran
who
live
on
the
eastern
shore
of
the
gulf
of
akaba
without
establishing
regular
patrols
of
the
bedouins
themselves
on
this
road
it
will
never
be
possible
to
keep
it
free
from
robbers
at
six
hours
and
a
half
begins
a
hilly
country
with
a
slight
descent
through
a
narrow
pass
between
hills
called
el
montala
arabic
a
favourite
spot
for
robbers
at
seven
hours
and
a
half
we
passed
adjeroud
arabic
about
half
an
hour
to
our
left
about
two
miles
west
of
it
is
a
well
in
the
wady
emshash
called
bir
emshash
which
yields
a
copious
supply
of
water
in
the
winter
but
dries
up
in
the
middle
of
summer
if
rains
have
not
been
abundant
the
garrison
of
adjeroud
where
is
a
well
so
bitter
that
even
camels
will
not
drink
the
water
draws
its
supply
of
drinking
water
from
the
bir
emshash
from
hence
the
road
turns
over
a
slightly
descending
plain
at
ten
hours
and
a
half
is
the
well
called
bir
suez
a
suez
copious
spring
enclosed
by
a
massive
building
from
whence
the
water
is
drawn
up
by
wheels
turned
by
oxen
and
emptied
into
a
large
stone
tank
on
the
outside
of
the
building
the
men
who
take
care
of
the
wheels
and
the
oxen
remain
constantly
shut
up
in
the
building
for
fear
of
the
bedouins
the
water
is
brackish
but
it
serves
for
drinking
and
the
arabs
and
egyptian
peasants
travelling
between
cairo
and
suez
who
do
not
choose
to
pay
a
higher
price
for
the
sweet
water
of
the
latter
place
are
in
the
habit
of
filling
their
water
skins
here
as
do
the
people
of
suez
for
their
cooking
provision
from
an
inscription
on
the
building
it
appears
that
it
was
erected
in
the
year
of
the
hedjra
we
reached
suez
about
sunset
at
the
end
of
eleven
hours
and
a
half
i
alighted
with
the
bedouins
upon
an
open
place
between
the
western
wall
of
the
town
and
its
houses
april
in
the
time
of
niebuhr
suez
was
not
enclosed
there
is
now
a
wall
on
the
west
and
which
is
rapidly
falling
to
decay
the
town
is
in
a
ruinous
state
and
neither
merchants
nor
artisans
live
in
it
its
population
consists
only
of
about
a
dozen
agents
who
receive
goods
from
the
ports
of
the
red
sea
and
forward
them
to
their
correspondents
at
cairo
together
with
some
who
deal
chiefly
in
provisions
the
pasha
keeps
a
garrison
here
of
about
fifty
horsemen
with
an
officer
who
commands
the
town
the
neighbouring
arabs
and
the
shipping
in
the
harbour
as
suez
is
one
of
the
few
harbours
in
the
red
sea
where
ships
can
be
repaired
some
vessels
are
constantly
seen
at
the
wharf
the
repairs
are
carried
on
by
greek
shipwrights
and
smiths
in
the
service
of
the
pasha
who
are
let
out
to
the
shipowners
by
the
commanding
officer
suez
has
of
late
become
a
harbour
of
secondary
importance
the
supplies
of
provisions
for
the
hedjaz
being
collected
principally
at
cosseir
and
shipped
from
thence
to
yembo
and
djidda
but
the
trade
in
coffee
and
india
goods
still
passes
this
way
to
cairo
i
saw
numerous
bales
of
spices
and
coffee
lying
near
the
shore
and
a
large
heap
of
iron
together
with
packages
of
small
wares
antimony
and
egyptian
goods
for
exportation
to
djidda
and
ultimately
to
yemen
and
india
the
merchants
complained
of
the
want
of
camels
to
transport
their
goods
to
cairo
the
pasha
who
owns
a
considerable
part
of
the
imports
of
coffee
has
fixed
the
carriage
across
the
desert
at
a
low
price
and
none
of
the
agents
venture
to
offer
more
to
the
camel
drivers
the
consequence
of
which
is
that
few
are
encouraged
to
come
to
suez
beyond
the
number
required
for
the
merchandize
a
caravan
consisting
of
five
or
six
hundred
camels
leaves
suez
for
cairo
on
the
of
each
lunar
month
accompanied
by
guards
and
two
while
smaller
ones
composed
of
twenty
or
thirty
beasts
depart
almost
every
four
or
five
days
but
to
these
the
merchants
are
shy
of
trusting
their
goods
because
they
can
never
depend
on
the
safety
of
the
road
accidents
however
seldom
happen
at
present
so
formidable
is
the
name
of
mohammed
ali
before
the
power
of
this
pasha
was
established
in
egypt
and
during
the
whole
period
of
the
mamelouk
government
the
bedouins
might
be
called
complete
masters
of
suez
every
inhabitant
was
obliged
t
o
have
his
protector
ghafyr
arabic
among
the
bedouins
of
mount
sinai
to
whom
he
made
annual
presents
of
money
corn
and
clothes
and
who
ensured
to
him
the
safe
passage
of
his
goods
and
person
through
the
desert
and
the
recovery
of
whatever
was
plundered
by
the
others
at
that
time
the
rate
of
freight
was
fixed
by
the
bedouins
and
camels
were
in
plenty
but
whenever
the
governors
of
cairo
quarrelled
with
the
bedouins
or
treated
any
of
them
at
cairo
the
road
was
immediately
interrupted
and
the
bedouins
placed
guards
over
the
well
of
naba
arabic
two
hours
distant
from
suez
in
the
hills
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
gulf
to
prevent
the
people
of
the
town
from
drawing
from
thence
their
daily
supply
of
sweet
water
the
difference
was
always
settled
by
presents
to
the
bedouins
who
however
as
may
readily
be
conceived
often
abused
their
power
and
it
not
unfrequently
happened
that
even
in
time
of
peace
a
bedouin
girl
would
be
found
in
the
morning
sitting
on
the
well
who
refused
permission
to
the
water
carriers
of
suez
to
draw
water
unless
they
paid
her
with
a
new
shirt
which
they
were
obliged
to
do
for
to
strike
her
or
even
to
remove
her
by
force
would
have
brought
on
a
war
with
her
tribe
the
authority
of
the
bedouins
is
now
at
an
end
though
their
sheikhs
receive
from
the
turkish
governors
of
suez
a
yearly
tribute
under
the
name
of
presents
in
clothes
and
money
the
pasha
himself
has
become
the
ghafyr
of
the
people
of
suez
and
exacts
from
every
camel
load
that
passes
through
the
gates
from
two
to
four
dollars
for
which
he
engages
to
ensure
the
passage
through
the
desert
when
the
caravan
however
was
plundered
in
he
never
returned
the
value
of
the
goods
to
the
owners
the
arabs
terabein
are
the
conductors
of
the
caravans
to
ghaza
and
khalyl
hebron
the
latter
of
which
is
eight
days
distant
at
this
time
the
freight
per
load
was
eighteen
patacks
or
four
dollars
and
a
half
these
caravans
bring
the
manufactures
of
damascus
soap
ware
tobacco
and
dried
fruits
which
are
shipped
at
suez
for
the
hedjaz
and
yemen
the
eastern
part
of
the
town
of
suez
is
completely
in
ruins
but
near
the
shore
are
some
well
built
khans
and
in
the
inhabited
part
of
the
town
are
several
good
private
houses
the
aspect
of
suez
is
that
of
an
arabian
and
not
an
egyptian
town
and
even
in
the
barren
waste
which
surrounds
it
it
resembles
yembo
and
djidda
the
same
motley
crowds
are
met
with
in
the
streets
and
the
greater
part
of
the
are
from
arabia
or
syria
the
air
is
bad
occasioned
by
the
saline
nature
of
the
earth
and
the
extensive
low
grounds
on
the
north
and
sides
which
are
filled
with
stagnant
waters
by
the
tides
the
inhabitants
endeavour
to
counteract
the
influence
of
this
bad
atmosphere
by
drinking
brandy
freely
the
mortality
is
not
diminished
by
such
a
remedy
and
fevers
of
a
malignant
kind
prevail
during
the
spring
and
summer
the
water
of
the
well
of
naba
though
called
sweet
has
a
very
indifferent
taste
and
becomes
putrid
in
a
few
days
if
kept
in
skins
the
government
has
made
a
sort
of
monopoly
of
it
but
its
distribution
is
very
irregular
and
affrays
often
happen
at
the
well
particularly
when
ships
are
on
the
point
of
sailing
in
general
however
they
touch
at
tor
for
a
supply
those
lying
in
the
harbour
might
fill
their
casks
at
the
well
of
abou
szoueyra
arabic
about
seven
hours
to
the
south
of
ayoun
mousa
and
about
half
an
hour
from
the
sea
shore
where
the
water
is
good
but
arabs
will
seldom
give
themselves
so
much
trouble
for
water
and
will
rather
drink
what
is
at
hand
though
bad
than
go
to
a
distance
for
good
ships
after
delivering
their
cargoes
at
suez
frequently
proceed
to
cosseir
to
take
in
corn

for
water
and
then
stand
over
to
the
western
coast
anchoring
in

every
evening

they
reach
their

the

it

of
a
deep
brownish

niebuhr
travelling
in
says
that
suez
derives
its
provisions
in
great
part
from
mount
sinai
and
ghaza
this
is
not
the
case
now
from
mount

it
obtains
nothing
but
charcoal
and
a
few
fruits
and
dates
in
the
autumn
dried
fruits
of
the
growth
of
damascus
are
the
only
import
from
ghaza
the
town
is
supplied
with
provisions
from
cairo
vegetables
are
found
only
at
the
time
of
the
arrival
of
the
caravan
every
article
is
of
the
worst
quality
and
per
cent
dearer
than
at
cairo
syrian
turkish
and
moggrebyn
pilgrims
are
constantly
seen
here
waiting
for
the
departure
of
ships
to
the
hedjaz
i
found
three
vessels
in
the
harbour
and
it
may
be
calculated
that
one
sails
to
the
southward
every
fortnight
no
europeans
are
settled
here
but
an
english
agent
is
expected
next
year
to
meet
the
ships
from
bombay
according
to
a
treaty
made
with
the
pasha
by
several
english
houses
who
wished
to
open
a
direct
communication
between
india
and
egypt
in
may
a
small
fleet
arrived
at

direct
from
bombay
which
was
composed
of
english
ships
and
of
others
belonging
to
mohammed
ali
pasha
among
the
articles
imported
were
two
elephants
destined
by
the
pasha
as
presents
to
the
porte
this
has
been
the
first
attempt
within
the
last
forty
years
to
open
a
direct
trade
between
india
and
egypt
and
will
be
as
profitable
to
the
pasha
as
it
must
be
ruinous
to
his
subjects
the
cargoes
of
these
ships
and
the
coffee
which
he
imports
from
yemen
are
distributed
by
him
among
the
merchants
of
cairo
in
proportion
to
their
supposed
capital
in
trade
and
they
are
obliged
to
take
the
articles
off
his
hands
at
the
highest
prices
which
they
bear
in
the
bazar
if
this
trade
is
encreased
by
the
pasha
it
will
entirely
prevent
the
merchants
from
importing
goods
on
their
own
account
from
djidda
the
quantity
they
are
thus
obliged
to
take
from
the
pasha
being
fully
sufficient
for

consumption
of

the
tide
was
then
at
flood
and
we
were
obliged
to
make
the
tour
of
the
whole
creek
to
the
of
the
town
which
at
low
water
can
be
forded
in
winter
time
and
immediately
after
the
rainy
season
this
circuit
is
rendered
still
greater
because
the
low
grounds
to
the
northward
of
the
creek
are
then
inundated
and
become
so
swampy
that
the
camels
can
not
pass
them
we
rode
one
hour
and
three
quarters
in
a
straight
line
northwards
after
passing
close
by
the
town
several
mounds
of
rubbish
which
afford
no
object
of
curiosity
except
a
few
large
stones
supposed
to
be
the
ruins
of
clysma
or
arsinoë
we
then
turned
eastwards
just
at
the
point
where
the
remains
of
the
ancient
canal
are
very
distinctly
visible
two
swellings
of
the
ground
of
which
the
eastern
is
about
eight
or
ten
feet
high
and
the
western
somewhat
less
run
in
a
straight
line
northwards
parallel
with
each
other
at
the
distance
of
about
feet
they
begin
at
a
few
hundred
paces
to
the
of
mark
from
whence
northwards
the
ground
is
covered
by
a
saline
crust
we
turned
the
point
of
this
inlet
and
halted
for
a
short
time
at
the
wells
of
ayoun
mousa
under
the
date
trees
the
water
of
these
wells
is
copious
but
one
only
affords
sweet
water
and
this
is
so
often
rendered
muddy
by
the
passage
of
arabs
whose
camels
descend
into
the
wells
that
it
is
seldom
fit
to
supply
a
provision
to
the
traveller
much
less
for
shipping
we
rested
at
two
hours
and
three
quarters
from
the
wells
in
the
plain
called
el
kordhye
arabic
april
proceeded
over
a
barren
sandy
and
gravelly
plain
called
el
ahtha
arabic
direction
by
for
about
an
hour
the
plain
was
uneven
we
then
entered
upon
a
flat
in
which
we
continued
low
mountains
the
commencement
wady
wardan
of
the
chain
of
tyh
run
parallel
with
the
road
to
the
left
about
eight
miles
distant
they
are
inhabited
by
terabein
at
the
end
of
four
hours
and
a
half
we
halted
for
a
few
hours
in
wady
seder
which
takes
its
name
of
wady
only
from
being
overflown
with
water
when
the
rains
are
very
copious
which
however
does
not
happen
every
year
its
natural
formation
by
no
means
entitles
it
to
be
called
a
valley
its
level
being
only
a
few
feet
lower
than
that
of
the
desert
on
both
sides
some
thorny
trees
grow
in
it
but
no
herbs
for
pasture
we
continued
our
way
over
the
plain
which
was
alternately
gravelly
stony
and
sandy
at
the
end
of
seven
hours
and
a
half
we
reached
wady
wardan
arabic
a
valley
or
bed
of
a
torrent
similar
in
nature
to
the
former
but
broader
near
its
extremity
at
the
sea
side
it
is
several
miles
in
breadth
and
here
is
the
well
of
abou
szoueyra
which
i
have
already
mentioned
the
arabs
of
tor
seldom
encamp
in
this
place
but
the
terabein
arabs
are
sometimes
attracted
by
the
well
during
the
war
which
happened
about
eight
years
ago
between
the
towara
and
the
maazy
bedouins
who
live
in
the
mountains
between
cairo
and
cosseir
a
party
of
the
former
happened
to
be
stationed
here
with
their
families
they
were
surprised
one
morning
by
a
troop
of
their
enemies
while
assembled
in
the
tent
to
drink
coffee
seven
or
eight
of
them
were
cut
down
the
sheikh
himself
an
old
man
seeing
escape
impossible
sat
down
by
the
fire
when
the
leader
of
the
maazy
came
up
and
cried
out
to
him
to
throw
down
his
turban
and
his
life
should
be
spared
the
generous
sheikh
rather
than
do
what
according
to
bedouin
notions
would
have
stained
his
reputation
ever
after
exclaimed
shall
not
uncover
my
head
before
my
enemies
and
was
immediately
killed
with
the
thrust
of
a
lance
a
low
chain
of
begins
here
to
the
west
near
the
sea
and
the
eastern
mountains
approach
the
road
at
nine
hours
and
a
half
howara
the
eastern
mountains
form
a
junction
with
the
western
hills
at
ten
hours
we
entered
a
hilly
country
at
ten
hours
and
three
quarters
we
rested
for
the
night
in
a
barren
valley
among
the
hills
called
wady
amara
arabic
we
met
with
nobody
in
this
route
except
a
party
of
yembo
merchants
who
had
landed
at
tor
and
were
travelling
to
cairo
the
hills
consist
of
chalk
and
silex
in
very
irregular
strata
the
silex
is
sometimes
quite
black
at
other
times
it
takes
a
lustre
and
transparency
much
resembling
agate
april
travelled
over
uneven
hilly
ground
gravelly
and
flinty
at
one
hour
and
three
quarters
we
passed
the
well
of
howara
arabic
round
which
a
few
date
trees
grow
niebuhr
travelled
the
same
route
but
his
guides
probably
did
not
lead
him
to
this
well
which
lies
among
hills
about
two
hundred
paces
out
of
the
road
he
mentions
a
rock
called
hadj
er
rakkabe
as
one
german
mile
short
of
gharendel
i
remember
to
have
halted
under
a
large
rock
close
by
the
road
side
a
very
short
distance
before
we
reached
howara
but
i
did
not
learn
its
name
the
water
of
the
well
of
howara
is
so
bitter
that
men
can
not
drink
it
and
even
camels
if
not
very
thirsty
refuse
to
taste
it
from
ayoun
mousa
to
the
well
of
howara
we
had
travelled
fifteen
hours
and
a
quarter
referring
to
this
distance
it
appears
probable
that
this
is
the
desert
of
three
days
mentioned
in
the
scriptures
to
have
been
crossed
by
the
israelites
immediately
after
their
passing
the
red
sea
and
at
the
end
of
which
they
arrived
at
marah
in
moving
with
a
whole
nation
the
march
may
well
be
supposed
to
have
occupied
three
days
and
the
bitter
well
at
marah
which
was
sweetened
by
moses
corresponds
exactly
with
that
of
howara
this
is
the
usual
route
to
mount
sinai
and
was
probably
therefore
that
which
the
israelites
took
on
their
escape
from
egypt
provided
it
be
admitted
that
they
crossed
the
sea
near
suez
as
niebuhr
with
good
reason
conjectures
there
is
wady
gharendel
no
other
road
of
three
days
march
in
the
way
from
suez
towards
sinai
nor
is
there
any
other
well
absolutely
bitter
on
the
whole
of
this
coast
as
far
as
ras
mohammed
the
complaints
of
the
bitterness
of
the
water
by
the
children
of
israel
who
had
been
accustomed
to
the
sweet
water
of
the
nile
are
such
as
may
daily
be
heard
from
the
egyptian
servants
and
peasants
who
travel
in
arabia
accustomed
from
their
youth
to
the
excellent
water
of
the
nile
there
is
nothing
which
they
so
much
regret
in
countries
distant
from
egypt
nor
is
there
any
eastern
people
who
feel
so
keenly
the
want
of
good
water
as
the
present
natives
of
egypt
with
respect
to
the
means
employed
by
moses
to
render
the
waters
of
the
well
sweet
i
have
frequently
enquired
among
the
bedouins
in
different
parts
of
arabia
whether
they
possessed
any
means
of
effecting
such
a
change
by
throwing
wood
into
it
or
by
any
other
process
but
i
never
could
learn
that
such
an
art
was
known
at
the
end
of
three
hours
we
reached
wady
gharendel
arabic
which
extends
to
the
and
is
almost
a
mile
in
breadth
and
full
of
trees
the
arabs
told
me
that
it
may
be
traced
through
the
whole
desert
and
that
it
begins
at
no
great
distance
from
el
arysh
on
the
mediterranean
but
i
had
no
means
of
ascertaining
the
truth
of
this
statement
about
half
an
hour
from
the
place
where
we
halted
in
a
southern
direction
is
a
copious
spring
with
a
small
rivulet
which
renders
the
valley
the
principal
station
on
this
route
the
water
is
disagreeable
and
if
kept
for
a
night
in
the
water
skins
it
turns
bitter
and
spoils
as
i
have
myself
experienced
having
passed
this
way
three
times
if
we
admit
bir
howara
to
be
the
marah
morra
in
arabic
means
marah
in
hebrew
is
of
exodus
xv
then
wady
gharendel
is
probably
elim
with
its
wells
and
date
trees
an
opinion
entertained
by
niebuhr
who
however
did
not
see
the
bitter
well
of
howara
on
the
road
to
gharendel
the
nonexistence
at
present
of
twelve
wells
at
gharendel
must
not
be
considered
as
evidence
against
the
conjecture
for
niebuhr
says
that
his
companions
obtained
water
here
by
digging
to
a
very
small
depth
and
there
was
a
great
plenty
of
it
when
i
passed
water
in
fact
is
readily
found
by
digging
in
every
fertile
valley
in
arabia
and
wells
are
thus
easily
formed
which
are
quickly
filled
up
again
by
the
sands
the
wady
gharendel
contains
date
trees
tamarisks
acacias
of
different
species
and
the
thorny
shrub
gharkad
arabic
the
peganum
retusum
of
forskal
which
is
extremely
common
in
this
peninsula
and
is
also
met
with
in
the
sands
of
the
delta
on
the
coast
of
the
mediterranean
its
small
red
berry
of
the
size
of
a
grain
of
the
pomegranate
is
very
juicy
and
refreshing
much
resembling
a
ripe
gooseberry
in
taste
but
not
so
sweet
the
arabs
are
very
fond
of
it
and
i
was
told
that
in
years
when
the
shrub
produces
large
crops
they
make
a
conserve
of
the
berries
the
gharkad
which
from
the
colour
of
its
fruit
is
also
called
by
the
arabs
homra
delights
in
a
sandy
soil
and
reaches
its
maturity
in
the
height
of
summer
when
the
ground
is
parched
up
exciting
an
agreeable
surprise
in
the
traveller
at
finding
so
juicy
a
berry
produced
in
the
driest
soil
and
season
might
not
the
berry
of
this
shrub
have
been
used
by
moses
to
sweeten
the
waters
of
marah
the
words
in
exodus
xv
are
the
lord
shewed
him
a
tree
which
when
he
had
cast
into
the
waters
the
waters
were
made
the
arabic
translation
of
this
passage
gives
a
different
and
perhaps
more
correct
reading
the
lord
guided
him
to
a
tree
of
which
he
threw
something
into
the
water
which
then
became
i
do
not
remember
to
have
seen
any
gharkad
in
the
neighbourhood
of
howara
but
wady
gharendel
is
full
of
this
shrub
as
these
conjectures
did
not
occur
to
me
when
i
was
on
the
spot
i
did
not
enquire
of
the
bedouins
whether
they
ever
sweetened
the
water
with
the
juice
of
the
berries
which
would
probably
effect
this
change
in
the
same
manner
as
the
juice
of
pomegranate
grains
expressed
into
it
the
bottom
of
the
valley
of
gharendel
swarms
with
ticks
which
are
extremely
distressing
both
to
men
and
beasts
and
on
this
account
the
caravans
usually
encamp
on
the
sides
of
the
hills
which
border
the
valley
wady
shebeyke
we
continued
in
a
direction
passing
over
hills
and
at
the
end
of
four
hours
from
our
starting
in
the
morning
we
came
to
an
open
though
hilly
country
still
slightly
ascending
and
then
reached
by
a
similar
descent
in
five
hours
and
a
half
wady
oszaita
arabic
enclosed
by
chalk
hills
here
is
another
bitter
well
which
never
yields
a
copious
supply
and
sometimes
is
completely
dried
up
a
few
date
trees
stand
near
it
from
hence
we
rode
over
a
wide
plain
and
at
the
end
of
seven
hours
and
three
quarters
came
to
wady
thale
arabic
rock
salt
is
found
here
as
well
as
in
gharendel
date
acacia
and
tamarisks
grow
in
the
valley
but
they
were
now
all
withered
to
our
right
was
a
chain
of
mountains
which
extend
towards
gharendel
proceeding
from
hence
south
we
turned
the
point
of
the
mountain
and
then
passed
the
rudely
constructed
tomb
of
a
female
saint
called
arys
themman
arabic
or
the
bridegroom
of
themman
where
the
arabs
are
in
the
habit
of
saying
a
short
prayer
and
suspending
some
rags
of
clothing
upon
some
poles
planted
round
the
tomb
after
having
doubled
the
mountain
we
entered
the
valley
called
wady
taybe
arabic
which
descends
rapidly
to
the
sea
at
the
end
of
eight
hours
and
a
half
we
turned
out
of
wady
taybe
into
a
branch
of
it
called
wady
shebeyke
arabic
in
which
we
continued
and
halted
for
the
night
after
a
march
of
nine
hours
and
a
quarter
this
is
a
broad
valley
with
steep
though
not
high
cliffs
on
both
sides
the
rock
is
calcareous
and
runs
in
even
horizontal
layers
just
over
the
road
a
place
was
shewn
to
me
from
whence
some
years
since
a
bedouin
of
the
arabs
of
tor
precipitated
his
son
bound
hands
and
feet
because
he
had
stolen
wady
hommar
corn
out
of
a
magazine
belonging
to
a
friend
of
the
family
in
the
great
eastern
desert
the
aeneze
bedouins
are
not
so
severe
in
such
instances
but
they
would
punish
a
bedouin
who
should
pilfer
any
thing
from
his
baggage
april
set
out
before
dawn
and
continued
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
in
the
wady
after
which
we
ascended
and
came
upon
a
high
plain
surrounded
by
rocks
with
a
towering
mountain
on
the
side
called
sarbout
el
djemel
arabic
we
crossed
the
plain
at
sun
rise
and
the
fresh
air
of
the
morning
was
extremely
agreeable
there
is
nothing
which
so
much
compensates
for
the
miseries
of
travelling
in
the
arabian
deserts
as
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
every
morning
the
sublime
spectacle
of
the
break
of
day
and
of
the
rising
of
the
sun
which
is
always
accompanied
even
in
the
hottest
season
with
a
refreshing
breeze
it
was
an
invariable
custom
with
me
at
setting
out
early
in
the
morning
to
walk
on
foot
for
a
few
hours
in
advance
of
the
caravan
and
as
enjoyments
are
comparative
i
believe
that
i
derived
from
this
practice
greater
pleasure
than
any
which
the
arts
of
the
most
luxurious
capitals
can
afford
at
two
hours
and
a
half
the
plain
terminated
we
then
turned
the
point
of
the
mountain
and
entered
the
valley
called
wady
hommar
arabic
in
which
we
continued
this
valley
in
which
a
few
acacia
trees
grow
has
no
perceptible
slope
on
either
side
its
rocks
are
all
calcareous
with
flint
upon
some
of
them
by
the
road
side
i
observed
a
few
scratchings
of
the
figures
of
camels
done
in
the
same
style
as
those
in
wady
mokatteb
copied
by
niebuhr
and
seetzen
but
without
any
inscriptions
at
four
hours
we
issued
from
this
valley
where
the
southern
rocks
which
enclose
it
terminate
and
we
travelled
over
a
wide
slightly
ascending
plain
of
deep
sand
called
el
debbe
arabic
a
name
given
by
the
towara
bedouins
to
several
other
sandy
districts
of
the
same
kind
wady
el
naszeb
the
direction
of
our
road
across
it
was
by
at
six
hours
and
a
half
we
entered
a
mountainous
country
much
devastated
by
torrents
which
have
given
the
mountains
a
very
wild
appearance
here
rocks
begin
we
followed
the
windings
of
a
valley
and
in
seven
hours
and
a
quarter
reached
the
wady
el
naszeb
arabic
where
we
rested
under
the
shade
of
a
large
impending
rock
which
for
ages
probably
has
afforded
shelter
to
travellers
it
is
i
believe
the
same
represented
by
niebuhr
in
vol
pl
he
calls
the
valley
warsan
which
is
no
doubt
its
true
name
but
the
arabs
comprise
all
the
contiguous
valleys
under
the
general
name
of
naszeb
shady
spots
like
this
are
well
known
to
the
arabs
and
as
the
scanty
foliage
of
the
acacia
the
only
tree
in
which
these
valleys
abound
affords
no
shade
they
take
advantage
of
such
rocks
and
regulate
the
journey
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
able
to
reach
them
at
noon
there
to
take
the
siesta
the
main
branch
of
the
wady
naszeb
continues
farther
up
to
the
and
contains
at
about
half
an
hour
from
the
place
where
we
rested
a
well
of
excellent
water
as
i
was
fatigued
and
the
sun
was
very
hot
i
neglected
to
go
there
though
i
am
sensible
that
travellers
ought
particularly
to
visit
wells
in
the
desert
because
it
is
at
these
natural
stations
that
traces
of
former
inhabitants
are
more
likely
to
be
found
than
any
where
else
the
wady
naszeb
empties
its
waters
in
the
rainy
season
into
the
gulf
of
suez
at
a
short
distance
from
the
birket
faraoun
while
my
guides
and
servant
lay
asleep
under
the
rock
and
one
of
the
arabs
had
gone
to
the
well
to
water
the
camels
and
fill
the
skins
i
walked
round
the
rock
and
was
surprised
to
find
inscriptions
similar
in
form
to
those
which
have
been
copied
by
travellers
in
wady
mokatteb
they
are
upon
the
surface
of
blocks
which
have
fallen
down
from
the
cliff
and
some
of
them
appear
to
have
been
engraved
while
the
pieces
still
formed
a
part
of
the
main
rock
there
is
a
great
number
of
them
but
few
can
be
distinctly
made
out
i
copied
the
following
from
some
rocks
which
are
lying
near
the
at
about
an
hundred
paces
from
the
spot
where
travellers
usually
alight
not
included
the
fallen
blocks
must
be
closely
examined
in
order
to
discover
the
inscriptions
in
some
places
they
are
still
to
be
seen
on
the
rock
above
they
have
evidently
been
done
in
great
haste
and
very
rudely
sometimes
with
large
letters
at
others
with
small
and
seldom
with
straight
lines
the
characters
appear
to
be
written
from
right
to
left
and
although
mere
scratches
an
instrument
of
metal
must
have
been
required
for
the
rock
though
of
sandstone
is
of
considerable
hardness
some
of
the
letters
are
not
higher
than
half
an
inch
but
they
are
generally
about
fifteen
lines
in
height
and
four
lines
in
breadth
the
annexed
figure
as
seetzen
has
already
observed
in
his
publication
upon
these
inscriptions
in
the
mines
de
is
seen
at
the
beginning
of
almost
every
line
hence
it
appears
that
none
of
the
inscriptions
are
of
any
length
but
that
they
consist
merely
of
short
phrases
all
similar
to
each
other
in
the
beginning
at
least
they
are
perhaps
prayers
or
the
names
of
pilgrims
on
their
way
to
mount
sinai
who
had
rested
under
this
rock
a
few
drawings
of
camels
and
goats
done
in
the
coarsest
manner
are
likewise
seen
niebuhr
vol
pl
has
given
some
sketches
of
them
some
syale
trees
a
species
of
the
mimosa
grow
in
this
valley
the
pod
which
they
produce
together
with
the
tenderest
shoots
of
the
branches
serve
as
fodder
to
the
camels
the
bark
of
the
tree
is
used
by
the
arabs
to
tan
leather
the
rocks
round
the
of
naszeb
are
much
shattered
and
broken
evidently
by
torrents
yet
no
torrents
within
the
memory
of
man
have
ever
rushed
down
the
valley
in
the
afternoon
we
entered
a
lateral
branch
of
the
naszeb
more
northerly
than
the
main
branch
which
contains
the
well
and
we
gradually
ascended
it
we
had
been
joined
at
the
ayoun
mousa
by
an
egyptian
bedouin
belonging
to
the
arabs
of
the
province
raml
el
morak
of
sherkyeh
who
was
married
to
a
girl
of
the
towara
arabs
last
night
being
in
the
vicinity
of
the
place
where
he
knew
his
wife
to
be
he
put
spurs
to
the
ass
on
which
he
was
mounted
and
thinking
that
he
knew
the
road
he
quitted
the
wady
shebeyke
two
hours
before
we
did
and
without
any
provision
of
water
he
missed
his
way
on
the
sandy
plain
of
debbe
and
instead
of
reaching
the
spring
of
naszeb
where
he
intended
to
allay
his
thirst
he
rode
the
whole
of
this
morning
and
afternoon
about
the
mountain
in
different
directions
in
fruitless
search
after
the
shady
and
conspicuous
rock
of
naszeb
towards
the
evening
we
met
him
so
much
exhausted
with
thirst
that
his
eyes
had
become
dim
and
he
could
scarcely
recognise
us
had
he
not
fallen
in
with
us
he
would
probably
have
perished
my
companions
laughed
at
the
effeminate
egyptian
as
they
called
him
and
his
presumption
in
travelling
alone
in
districts
with
which
he
was
unacquainted
at
the
end
of
eight
hours
and
three
quarters
in
a
general
direction
of
by
we
passed
a
small
inlet
in
the
northern
chain
where
at
a
short
distance
from
the
road
is
said
to
be
a
well
of
tolerable
water
called
el
maleha
arabic
or
the
saltish
we
then
ascended
with
difficulty
a
steep
mountain
composed
to
the
top
of
moving
sands
with
a
very
few
rocks
appearing
above
the
surface
we
reached
the
summit
after
a
march
of
nine
hours
and
three
quarters
and
rested
upon
a
high
plain
called
raml
el
morak
arabic
from
hence
we
had
an
extensive
view
to
the
north
bounded
by
the
chain
of
mountains
called
el
tyh
arabic
this
range
begins
near
the
abovementioned
mountain
of
sarbout
el
djemel
and
extends
in
a
curve
eastwards
twenty
or
miles
from
the
termination
of
the
wady
hommar
at
the
eastern
extremity
lies
a
high
mountain
called
djebel
odjme
arabic
to
the
north
of
which
begins
another
chain
likewise
running
eastwards
towards
the
gulf
of
wady
khamyle
akaba
the
name
of
el
tyh
is
applied
to
this
ridge
as
well
as
to
the
former
but
it
is
specifically
called
el
dhelel
arabic
these
chains
form
the
northern
boundaries
of
the
sinai
mountains
and
are
the
pasturing
places
of
the
sinai
bedouins
they
are
the
most
regular
ranges
of
the
peninsula
being
almost
throughout
of
equal
height
without
any
prominent
peaks
and
extending
in
an
uninterrupted
line
eastwards
they
are
inhabited
by
the
tribes
of
terabein
and
tyaha
the
latter
of
whom
are
richer
in
camels
and
flocks
than
any
other
of
the
towara
tribes
the
valleys
of
these
mountains
are
said
to
afford
excellent
pasturage
and
fine
springs
though
not
in
great
numbers
the
terabein
frequently
visit
cairo
and
suez
but
the
tyaha
have
more
intercourse
with
ghaza
and
khalyl
and
are
a
very
bold
independent
people
often
at
war
with
their
neighbours
and
even
now
caring
little
for
the
authority
of
the
pasha
of
egypt
at
the
southern
foot
of
the
mountain
tyh
extends
a
broad
sandy
plain
called
el
seyh
which
begins
at
the
debbe
and
continues
for
two
days
journey
eastwards
it
affords
good
pasturage
in
spring
but
has
no
water
and
is
therefore
little
frequented
by
bedouins
april
crossed
the
plain
of
raml
morak
in
a
by
direction
from
hence
the
high
peak
of
serbal
bore
in
an
hour
and
a
quarter
we
reached
the
upper
chain
of
the
mountains
of
sinai
where
grünstein
begins
mixed
in
places
with
layers
of
granite
and
we
entered
the
valley
called
wady
khamyle
arabic
at
the
end
of
two
hours
we
passed
in
the
valley
a
projecting
rock
like
that
of
naszeb
serving
for
a
to
travellers
here
i
observed
several
inscriptions
similar
to
those
of
naszeb
but
much
effaced
together
with
rude
drawings
of
mountain
goats
as
i
did
not
wish
to
betray
too
much
curiosity
until
i
could
ascertain
what
conduct
i
ought
to
pursue
in
order
to
attain
my
chief
object
of
penetrating
to
akaba
i
did
not
stop
to
copy
wady
barak
these
monuments
at
the
end
of
two
hours
and
a
half
in
the
wady
khamyle
we
came
to
the
first
bedouin
encampment
which
i
had
seen
since
leaving
suez
it
belonged
to
the
tribe
of
szowaleha
arabic
on
the
approach
of
summer
all
the
bedouins
leave
the
lower
country
where
the
herbage
is
dried
up
and
retire
towards
the
higher
parts
of
the
peninsula
where
owing
to
the
comparatively
cooler
climate
the
pasture
preserves
its
freshness
much
longer
ascending
gently
through
the
valley
we
passed
at
three
hours
a
place
of
burial
called
mokbera
arabic
one
of
the
places
of
interment
of
the
tribe
of
szowaleha
it
seems
to
be
a
custom
prevalent
with
the
arabs
in
every
part
of
the
desert
to
have
regular
whither
they
carry
their
dead
sometimes
from
the
distance
of
several
days
journey
the
burying
ground
seen
by
niebuhr
voyage
vol
near
naszeb
which
as
i
have
already
mentioned
i
passed
without
visiting
and
missed
in
my
way
back
by
taking
a
more
southern
road
appears
to
have
been
an
ancient
cemetery
of
the
same
kind
formed
at
a
time
when
hieroglyphical
characters
were
in
use
among
all
the
nations
under
egyptian
influence
as
there
are
no
countries
where
ancient
manners
are
so
permanent
as
in
the
desert
it
is
probable
that
the
same
customs
of
sepulture
then
prevailed
which
still
exist
and
that
the
burying
ground
described
by
niebuhr
by
no
means
proves
the
former
existence
of
a
city
among
the
rude
tombs
of
mokbera
which
consist
for
the
most
part
of
mere
heaps
of
earth
covered
with
loose
stones
the
tomb
of
sheikh
hamyd
a
bedouin
saint
is
distinguished
the
szowaleha
keep
it
always
carefully
covered
with
fresh
herbs
at
the
end
of
three
hours
and
a
half
we
entered
another
valley
called
wady
barak
arabic
where
the
ascent
becomes
more
steep
here
the
rock
changes
to
porphyry
with
strata
of
grünstein
the
surface
of
the
former
is
in
most
places
completely
wady
genne
black
the
mountains
on
both
sides
of
the
valley
are
much
shattered
detached
blocks
and
loose
stones
covered
their
sides
and
the
bottom
of
the
valley
was
filled
in
many
places
to
the
depth
of
ten
feet
with
a
layer
of
stones
that
had
fallen
down
the
wady
becomes
narrower
towards
the
upper
end
and
the
camels
ascended
with
difficulty
at
the
end
of
six
hours
and
a
quarter
we
reached
the
extremity
to
which
the
bedouins
apply
the
name
of
djebel
leboua
arabic
the
mountain
of
the
lioness
a
name
indicating
perhaps
that
lions
existed
at
one
period
in
the
peninsula
of
mount
sinai
though
no
longer
to
be
found
here
in
ascending
wady
barak
i
saw
upon
several
blocks
lying
by
the
road
side
short
inscriptions
generally
of
one
line
only
all
of
which
began
with
the
remarkable
character
already
represented
from
the
top
of
djebel
leboua
we
descended
a
little
and
entered
the
wady
genne
arabic
a
fine
valley
several
miles
in
breadth
and
covered
with
pasturage
it
lay
in
a
straight
line
before
us
and
presented
much
of
alpine
scenery
we
here
found
several
bedouins
occupied
in
collecting
which
they
burn
into
charcoal
for
the
cairo
market
they
prefer
for
this
purpose
the
thick
roots
of
the
shrub
rethem
arabic
genista
raetam
of
forskal
which
grows
here
in
abundance
of
the
herbs
which
grow
in
this
valley
many
were
odoriferous
as
the
obeytheran
sille
arabic
perhaps
the
zilla
myagrum
of
forskal
and
the
shyh
arabic
or
artemisia
the
bedouins
collect
also
the
herb
adjrem
arabic
which
they
dry
break
in
pieces
and
pound
between
stones
and
then
use
as
a
substitute
for
soap
to
wash
their
linen
with
i
was
told
that
very
good
water
is
found
at
about
two
miles
to
the
of
this
valley
we
gained
the
upper
extremity
of
wady
genne
at
the
end
of
nine
hours
the
ranges
of
mountains
in
this
country
differ
in
their
formation
from
all
the
other
arabian
chains
which
i
have
wady
osh
seen
the
valleys
reaching
to
the
very
summits
where
they
form
a
plain
and
thence
descend
on
the
other
side
a
very
pointed
peak
of
rocks
near
the
left
of
the
summit
of
wady
genne
is
known
by
the
appellation
of
zob
el
bahry
arabic
after
crossing
a
short
plain
we
again
descended
by
and
entered
the
valley
called
wady
berah
arabic
where
i
saw
another
block
with
inscriptions
near
it
were
many
others
but
effaced
the
following
was
more
regularly
and
clearly
written
than
any
i
have
seen
not
included
we
descended
slowly
through
this
valley
which
is
covered
with
sand
till
at
the
end
of
ten
hours
we
entered
a
side
valley
called
wady
osh
arabic
and
at
ten
hours
and
a
half
alighted
at
an
encampment
of
bedouins
pitched
at
no
great
distance
from
a
burial
ground
similar
to
that
which
we
had
passed
in
the
morning
this
encampment
belonged
to
the
oulad
said
arabic
a
branch
of
the
szowaleha
tribe
and
one
of
their
sheikhs
hassan
arabic
had
his
tent
here
this
we
entered
though
he
was
absent
and
the
arabs
had
a
long
and
fierce
dispute
among
themselves
to
decide
who
should
have
the
honour
of
furnishing
us
a
supper
and
a
breakfast
the
next
morning
he
who
first
sees
the
stranger
from
afar
and
exclaims
comes
my
guest
has
the
right
of
entertaining
him
whatever
tent
he
may
alight
at
a
lamb
was
killed
for
me
which
was
an
act
of
great
hospitality
for
these
bedouins
are
poor
and
a
lamb
was
worth
upwards
of
a
spanish
dollar
a
sum
that
would
afford
a
supply
of
butter
and
bread
to
the
family
for
a
whole
week
i
found
the
same
custom
to
prevail
here
which
i
observed
in
my
journey
through
the
northern
parts
of
arabia
petraea
when
meat
is
served
up
it
is
the
duty
of
one
of
the
guests
to
demand
a
portion
for
the
women
by
calling
out
lahm
el
ferash
meat
for
the
apartment
of
the
women
and
a
part
of
it
is
then
either
set
aside
or
he
is
answered
that
this
has
been
already
done
in
the
evening
we
joined
in
some
of
the
popular
songs
of
which
a
description
will
be
found
in
my
illustration
of
bedouin
manners
this
will
form
part
of
a
subsequent
volume
ed
i
was
naturally
asked
for
what
object
i
had
come
to
these
mountains
as
the
passage
of
greeks
on
their
way
to
visit
the
convent
of
sinai
is
frequent
i
might
have
answered
that
i
was
a
greek
but
i
thought
it
better
to
adhere
to
what
i
had
already
told
my
guides
that
i
had
left
cairo
in
order
not
to
expose
myself
to
the
plague
that
i
wished
to
pass
my
time
among
the
bedouins
while
the
disease
prevailed
and
that
i
intended
to
visit
the
convent
other
moslems
would
have
considered
it
impious
to
fly
from
the
infection
but
i
knew
that
all
these
bedouins
entertain
as
great
a
dread
of
the
plague
as
europeans
themselves
during
the
spring
when
the
disease
usually
prevails
in
egypt
no
prospect
of
gain
can
induce
them
to
expose
themselves
to
infection
by
a
journey
to
the
banks
of
the
nile
the
bedouins
with
whom
i
left
cairo
were
the
last
who
had
remained
there
had
the
pasha
granted
me
a
firmahn
to
the
great
sheikh
of
the
towara
arabs
i
should
have
gone
directly
to
his
tent
and
in
virtue
of
it
i
should
have
taken
guides
to
conduct
me
to
akaba
but
being
without
the
firmahn
i
thought
it
more
prudent
to
visit
the
convent
in
the
first
instance
and
to
depart
from
thence
for
akaba
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
such
influence
as
the
prior
might
possess
over
the
bedouins
for
though
they
pay
little
respect
to
the
priests
yet
they
have
some
fear
of
being
excluded
from
the
gains
accruing
from
the
transport
of
visitors
to
the
convent
as
every
person
who
makes
his
appearance
in
the
desert
is
supposed
by
the
arabs
to
be
attached
to
the
turkish
army
or
the
government
of
cairo
my
going
to
akaba
without
any
recommendations
would
have
given
rise
to
much
suspicion
and
i
should
probably
have
been
supposed
to
be
a
deserter
from
the
turkish
army
attempting
to
escape
by
that
circuitous
route
to
syria
a
practice
which
is
sometimes
resorted
to
by
the
soldiers
to
whom
without
the
passport
egypt
is
closed
both
by
sea
and
land
in
the
wady
osh
there
is
a
well
of
sweet
water
from
hence
upwards
and
throughout
the
primitive
chain
of
mount
sinai
the
water
is
generally
excellent
while
in
the
lower
chalky
mountains
all
round
the
peninsula
it
is
brackish
or
bitter
except
in
one
or
two
places
the
wady
osh
and
wady
berah
empty
their
waters
in
the
rainy
season
into
wady
el
sheikh
above
feiran
april
did
not
leave
our
kind
hosts
till
the
afternoon
for
they
insisted
on
my
taking
a
dinner
before
i
set
out
i
gave
to
their
children
who
accompanied
me
a
little
way
some
coffee
beans
to
carry
to
their
mothers
and
some
kammereddein
a
sweetmeat
made
at
damascus
from
apricots
of
which
i
had
laid
in
a
large
stock
and
which
is
very
acceptable
to
all
the
bedouins
of
syria
egypt
and
the
hedjaz
the
offer
of
any
reward
to
a
bedouin
host
is
generally
offensive
to
his
pride
but
some
little
presents
may
be
given
to
the
women
and
children
trinkets
and
similar
articles
are
little
esteemed
by
the
bedouins
but
coffee
is
in
great
request
all
over
the
desert
and
sweetmeats
and
sugar
are
preferred
to
money
which
though
it
will
sometimes
be
accepted
always
creates
a
sense
of
humiliation
and
consequently
of
dislike
towards
the
giver
for
my
own
part
being
convinced
that
the
hospitality
of
the
bedouin
is
afforded
with
disinterested
cordiality
i
was
in
general
averse
to
making
the
slightest
return
few
travellers
perhaps
will
agree
with
me
on
this
head
but
will
treat
the
bedouins
in
the
same
manner
as
the
turks
and
other
inhabitants
of
the
towns
who
never
proffer
their
services
or
wady
el
sheikh
hospitality
without
expecting
a
reward
the
feelings
of
bedouins
however
are
very
different
from
those
of
townsmen
and
a
bedouin
will
praise
the
guest
who
departs
from
him
without
making
any
other
remuneration
than
that
of
bestowing
a
blessing
upon
them
and
their
encampment
much
more
than
him
who
thinks
to
redeem
all
obligations
by
payment
we
returned
from
wady
osh
towards
wady
berah
but
leaving
the
latter
which
here
takes
a
direction
towards
wady
feiran
we
ascended
by
a
narrow
valley
called
wady
akhdhar
arabic
here
i
again
saw
some
inscriptions
on
blocks
of
stone
lying
by
the
road
side
a
few
hours
to
the
of
wady
osh
is
a
mountain
called
sheyger
where
native
cinnabar
is
collected
it
is
called
rasokht
arabic
by
the
arabs
and
is
usually
found
in
small
pieces
about
the
size
of
a
egg
it
is
very
seldom
crystallized
but
there
are
sometimes
nodules
on
the
surface
it
stains
the
fingers
of
a
dark
colour
and
its
fracture
is
in
perpendicular
fibres
i
did
not
hear
that
the
arabs
traded
at
all
in
this
metal
in
wady
osh
are
rocks
of
gneiss
mixed
with
granite
gneiss
is
found
in
many
parts
of
the
peninsula
after
one
hour
we
came
to
a
steep
ascent
and
descent
called
el
szaleib
arabic
which
occupied
two
hours
we
then
continued
our
descent
into
the
great
valley
called
wady
el
sheikh
arabic
one
of
the
principal
valleys
of
the
peninsula
the
rocks
of
szaleib
consist
throughout
of
granite
on
the
upper
strata
of
which
run
layers
of
red
feldspath
some
of
which
has
fallen
down
and
covers
the
valley
in
broken
fragments
the
wady
el
sheikh
is
broad
and
has
a
very
slight
acclivity
it
is
much
frequented
by
bedouins
for
its
pasturage
whenever
rain
falls
in
the
mountains
a
stream
of
water
flows
through
this
wady
and
from
thence
through
wady
feiran
into
the
sea
we
rode
in
a
direction
along
the
wady
el
sheikh
for
two
hours
and
then
halted
in
it
for
the
night
after
an
march
of
four
hours
several
arabs
of
the
encampment
where
we
slept
the
preceding
night
had
joined
our
party
to
go
to
the
convent
for
no
other
reason
i
believe
than
to
get
a
good
dinner
and
supper
on
the
road
this
evening
eight
persons
kneeled
down
round
a
dish
of
rice
cooked
with
milk
which
i
had
brought
from
wady
osh
and
the
being
kept
on
the
fire
we
sat
in
conversation
till
near
midnight
may
continued
in
a
direction
ascending
slightly
the
valley
then
becomes
narrower
at
two
hours
we
came
to
a
thick
wood
of
tamarisk
or
tarfa
and
found
many
camels
feeding
upon
their
thorny
shoots
it
is
from
this
evergreen
tamarisk
which
grows
abundantly
in
no
other
part
of
the
peninsula
that
the
manna
is
collected
we
now
approached
the
central
summits
of
mount
sinai
which
we
had
had
in
view
for
several
days
abrupt
cliffs
of
granite
from
six
to
eight
hundred
feet
in
height
whose
surface
is
blackened
by
the
sun
surround
the
avenues
leading
to
the
elevated
platform
to
which
the
name
of
sinai
is
specifically
applied
these
cliffs
enclose
the
holy
mountain
on
three
sides
leaving
the
and
sides
only
towards
the
gulf
of
akaba
more
open
to
the
view
on
both
sides
of
the
wood
of
tarfa
trees
extends
a
range
of
low
hills
of
a
substance
called
by
the
arabs
tafal
arabic
which
i
believe
to
be
principally
a
detritus
of
the
feldspar
of
granite
but
which
at
first
sight
has
all
the
appearance
of
it
is
brittle
crumbles
easily
between
the
fingers
and
leaves
upon
them
its
colour
which
is
a
pale
yellow
the
arabs
sell
it
at
cairo
where
it
is
in
request
for
taking
stains
out
of
cloth
and
where
it
serves
the
poor
instead
of
soap
for
washing
their
hands
but
it
is
chiefly
used
to
rub
the
skins
of
asses
during
summer
being
supposed
to
refresh
them
and
to
defend
them
against
the
heat
of
the
sun
at
the
end
of
three
hours
we
entered
the
cliffs
sheikh
szaleh
by
a
narrow
defile
about
forty
feet
in
breadth
with
perpendicular
granite
rocks
on
both
sides
the
ground
is
covered
with
sand
and
pebbles
brought
down
by
the
torrent
which
rushes
from
the
upper
region
in
the
winter
time
in
a
broader
part
of
the
pass
an
insulated
rock
about
five
feet
high
with
a
kind
of
naturally
formed
seat
is
shewn
as
a
place
upon
which
moses
once
reposed
whence
it
has
the
name
of
mokad
seidna
mousa
arabic
the
bedouins
keep
it
covered
with
green
or
dry
herbs
and
some
of
them
kiss
it
or
touch
it
with
their
hands
in
passing
by
beyond
it
the
valley
opens
the
mountains
on
both
sides
diverge
from
the
road
and
the
wady
el
sheikh
continues
in
a
direction
with
a
slight
ascent
a
little
to
the
east
from
hence
is
the
well
called
bir
mohsen
arabic
after
continuing
in
the
wady
for
an
hour
beyond
the
defile
we
entered
a
narrow
inlet
in
the
eastern
chain
and
rested
near
a
spring
called
abou
szoueyr
arabic
at
four
hours
and
a
half
was
a
small
walled
plantation
of
tobacco
with
some
fruit
trees
and
onions
cultivated
by
some
of
the
bedouins
oulad
said
in
the
afternoon
we
crossed
the
mountain
by
a
fell
again
into
the
wady
el
sheikh
and
at
the
end
of
eight
hours
from
our
setting
out
in
the
morning
reached
the
tomb
of
sheikh
szaleh
arabic
from
which
the
whole
valley
takes
its
name
the
coffin
of
the
sheikh
is
deposited
in
a
small
rude
stone
building
and
is
surrounded
by
a
thin
partition
of
wood
hung
with
green
cloth
upon
which
several
prayers
are
embroidered
on
the
walls
are
suspended
silk
tassels
handkerchiefs
ostrich
eggs
camel
halters
bridles
the
offerings
of
the
bedouins
who
visit
this
tomb
i
could
not
learn
exactly
the
history
of
this
sheikh
szaleh
some
said
that
he
was
the
forefather
of
the
tribe
of
szowaleha
others
the
great
moslem
prophet
szaleh
sent
to
the
tribe
of
thamoud
and
who
is
mentioned
in
the
koran
and
others
again
that
he
was
a
local
saint
which
i
believe
to
be
the
truth
among
convent
of
mount
sinai
the
bedouins
this
tomb
is
the
most
revered
spot
in
the
peninsula
next
to
the
mountain
of
moses
they
make
frequent
vows
to
kill
a
sheep
in
honour
of
the
sheikh
should
a
event
take
place
and
if
this
happens
the
votary
repairs
to
the
tomb
with
his
family
and
friends
and
there
passes
a
day
of
conviviality
once
in
every
year
all
the
tribes
of
the
towara
repair
hither
in
pilgrimage
and
remain
encamped
in
the
valley
round
the
tomb
for
three
days
many
sheep
are
then
killed
camel
races
are
run
and
the
whole
night
is
passed
in
dancing
and
singing
the
men
and
women
are
dressed
in
their
best
attire
the
festival
which
is
the
greatest
among
these
people
usually
takes
place
in
the
latter
part
of
june
when
the
nile
begins
to
rise
in
egypt
and
the
plague
subsides
and
a
caravan
leaves
sinai
immediately
afterwards
for
cairo
it
is
just
at
this
period
too
that
the
dates
ripen
in
the
valleys
of
the
lower
chain
of
sinai
and
the
pilgrimage
to
sheikh
szaleh
thus
becomes
the
most
remarkable
period
in
the
bedouin
year
in
the
western
mountain
opposite
sheikh
szaleh
and
about
one
hour
and
a
half
distant
is
a
fruitful
pasturing
place
upon
a
high
mountain
with
many
fields
and
plantations
of
trees
called
el
fereya
arabic
where
once
a
convent
stood
it
is
in
possession
of
the
oulad
said
we
continued
from
sheikh
szaleh
farther
till
at
the
end
of
six
hours
and
a
half
we
turned
to
our
right
into
a
broad
valley
at
the
termination
of
which
i
was
agreeably
surprised
by
the
beautiful
verdure
of
a
garden
of
almond
trees
belonging
to
the
convent
from
thence
by
another
short
turn
to
the
left
we
reached
the
convent
in
seven
hours
and
a
half
we
alighted
under
a
window
by
which
the
priests
communicate
with
the
arabs
below
the
letter
of
recommendation
which
i
had
with
me
was
drawn
up
by
a
cord
and
when
the
prior
had
read
it
a
stick
tied
across
a
rope
was
let
down
upon
which
i
placed
myself
and
was
hoisted
up
like
all
travellers
i
received
a
cordial
reception
and
was
shewn
into
the
same
neatly
furnished
room
in
which
all
preceding
europeans
had
taken
up
their
abode
i
rested
in
the
convent
three
days
when
i
told
the
monks
that
i
intended
to
go
to
akaba
they
gave
me
very
little
encouragement
particularly
when
they
learnt
that
i
had
no
firmahn
from
the
pasha
but
finding
that
i
was
firmly
resolved
they
sent
for
the
chief
ghafyr
or
protector
of
the
convent
and
recommended
me
strongly
to
him
the
monks
live
in
such
constant
dread
of
the
bedouins
who
knowing
very
well
their
timid
disposition
take
every
opportunity
to
strengthen
their
fears
that
they
believe
a
person
is
going
to
certain
destruction
who
trusts
himself
to
the
guidance
of
these
bedouins
any
where
but
on
the
great
road
to
suez
or
to
tor
i
had
been
particularly
pleased
with
the
character
and
behaviour
of
hamd
ibn
zoheyr
the
bedouin
who
had
joined
us
at
suez
and
not
being
equally
satisfied
with
the
guide
who
had
brought
me
from
cairo
i
discharged
him
and
engaged
hamd
for
the
journey
to
akaba
he
did
not
know
the
road
himself
but
one
of
his
uncles
who
had
been
there
assured
us
that
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
tribe
of
heywat
which
we
should
meet
on
the
road
and
with
all
the
passages
of
the
country
i
therefore
engaged
him
together
with
hamd
as
no
visitor
of
the
convent
is
permitted
to
leave
it
without
the
knowledge
of
one
of
the
ghafyrs
who
has
a
right
to
share
in
the
profits
of
the
escort
i
was
obliged
to
give
a
few
piastres
to
him
who
is
at
present
the
director
of
the
affairs
of
the
convent
in
the
desert
the
arabs
have
established
here
the
same
custom
which
i
remarked
in
my
journey
from
tor
to
cairo
every
one
who
is
present
at
the
departure
of
a
stranger
or
of
a
loaded
camel
from
the
convent
is
entitled
to
a
fee
provided
the
traveller
has
not
passed
wady
sal
a
line
which
is
about
one
mile
from
the
convent
to
avoid
this
unnecessary
company
and
expense
i
stole
out
of
the
convent
by
night
as
secretly
as
possible
but
we
were
overtaken
within
the
limits
by
a
bedouin
and
my
guides
were
obliged
to
give
him
six
piastres
to
make
him
desist
from
farther
claims
i
left
my
servant
and
unnecessary
baggage
at
the
convent
and
mounted
a
camel
for
the
hire
of
which
i
gave
five
dollars
and
i
paid
as
much
to
each
of
my
guides
who
were
also
mounted
and
were
to
conduct
me
to
akaba
and
back
again
may
left
the
convent
before
day
light
but
travelled
no
farther
to
day
than
to
the
well
of
abou
szoueyr
where
we
had
rested
on
the
first
of
may
and
where
a
large
company
of
arabs
assembled
when
they
heard
of
our
arrival
they
quarrelled
long
with
my
guides
for
having
taken
me
clandestinely
from
the
convent
but
were
at
last
pacified
by
a
lamb
which
i
bought
and
partook
of
with
them
in
the
evening
we
heard
from
afar
the
songs
of
an
encampment
to
which
my
guides
went
to
join
in
the
dance
i
remained
with
the
baggage
in
conversation
with
an
arab
who
had
lately
come
from
khalyl
or
hebron
and
who
much
dissuaded
me
from
going
to
akaba
he
assured
me
that
the
uncle
of
hamd
my
guide
knew
nothing
of
the
arabs
of
those
parts
nor
even
the
paths
through
the
country
but
i
slighted
his
advice
because
i
believed
that
it
was
dictated
by
envy
and
that
he
wished
himself
to
be
one
of
the
party
the
result
shewed
however
that
he
was
right
may
sunrise
we
left
abou
szoueyr
and
ascended
a
hilly
country
for
half
an
hour
after
a
short
descent
which
on
this
side
terminates
the
district
of
sinai
properly
so
called
we
continued
over
a
wide
open
plain
with
low
hills
called
szoueyry
arabic
direction
in
an
hour
and
a
half
we
entered
a
narrow
valley
called
wady
sal
arabic
formed
by
the
lower
ridges
of
the
primitive
mountains
in
the
windings
of
which
we
descended
slightly
and
on
the
top
i
found
the
rock
to
be
granite
somewhat
lower
down
grünstein
and
porphyry
began
to
appear
farther
on
granite
and
porphyry
cease
entirely
and
the
rock
consists
solely
of
grünstein
which
in
many
places
takes
the
nature
of
slate
some
of
the
layers
of
porphyry
are
very
striking
they
run
perpendicularly
from
the
very
summit
of
the
mountain
to
the
base
in
a
band
of
about
twelve
feet
in
width
and
projecting
somewhat
from
the
other
rocks
on
the
side
i
had
observed
similar
strata
in
wady
genne
but
running
horizontally
along
the
whole
chain
of
mountains
and
dividing
it
as
it
were
into
two
equal
parts
the
porphyry
i
have
met
with
in
sinai
is
usually
a
red
indurated
argillaceous
substance
in
some
specimens
it
had
the
appearance
of
red
feldspath
in
the
argil
are
imbedded
small
crystals
of
hornblende
or
of
mica
and
thin
pieces
of
quartz
at
most
two
lines
square
i
never
saw
any
large
fragments
of
quartz
in
it
its
universal
colour
is
red
the
lower
mountains
of
sinai
are
much
more
regularly
shaped
than
the
upper
ones
they
are
less
rugged
have
no
insulated
peaks
and
their
summits
fall
off
in
smooth
curves
the
wady
sal
is
extremely
barren
we
found
no
pasture
for
our
camels
as
no
rain
had
fallen
during
the
two
last
years
in
the
whole
of
this
eastern
part
of
the
peninsula
a
few
acacia
trees
grew
in
different
places
we
rested
at
noon
under
one
of
them
while
a
cup
of
coffee
was
prepared
and
then
pursued
the
wady
downwards
until
at
the
end
of
seven
hours
we
issued
from
it
into
a
small
plain
which
we
soon
crossed
and
at
seven
hours
and
a
half
entered
another
valley
similar
to
the
former
where
i
again
saw
some
granite
of
the
gray
species
our
descent
was
here
very
rapid
and
at
the
end
of
nine
hours
and
a
half
we
reached
a
lower
level
in
a
broad
valley
running
southwards
haydar
from
hence
the
summit
of
mount
catherine
behind
the
convent
bore
by
calcareous
and
sand
rocks
begin
here
and
the
bottom
of
the
valley
is
deep
sand
we
rode
in
it
in
the
direction
by
and
after
a
march
of
eleven
hours
alighted
in
a
plain
at
a
spot
which
afforded
some
shrubs
for
our
camels
to
feed
upon
the
elder
of
my
two
guides
by
name
szaleh
soon
proved
himself
to
be
ignorant
of
the
road
he
might
have
passed
this
way
in
his
youth
and
have
had
a
recollection
of
the
general
direction
of
the
valleys
but
when
we
arrived
in
the
plain
he
proceeded
in
various
directions
in
search
of
a
road
from
the
east
we
had
now
about
six
or
eight
miles
to
our
left
a
long
and
straight
chain
of
mountains
the
continuation
i
believe
of
that
of
tyh
or
dhelel
mentioned
above
and
running
almost
parallel
with
our
route
the
northern
side
of
these
mountains
is
inhabited
by
the
tribe
of
tyaha
here
passes
the
road
which
leads
straight
from
the
convent
to
akaba
while
the
one
we
took
descended
to
the
sea
and
had
been
chosen
by
my
guides
for
greater
security
the
upper
road
passes
by
the
watering
places
zelka
el
ain
the
well
a
place
much
frequented
by
bedouins
and
where
many
grow
and
lastly
by
el
hossey
it
is
the
common
route
from
the
convent
to
khalyl
and
jerusalem
may
started
early
and
continued
our
way
over
the
plain
which
is
called
haydar
arabic
it
appears
to
follow
the
mountain
of
tyh
as
far
as
its
western
extremity
and
there
to
join
the
seyh
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
thus
forming
the
northern
sandy
boundary
of
the
lower
sinai
chain
as
we
proceeded
we
approached
nearer
to
the
mountain
and
at
length
fell
in
with
the
looked
for
road
the
ground
is
gravelly
but
covered
with
moving
sands
which
are
raised
by
the
slightest
wind
to
the
east
the
country
was
open
with
low
hills
as
far
as
i
could
see
our
road
lay
at
one
hour
and
a
half
mount
catharine
bore
wady
rahab
by
we
now
descended
into
a
valley
of
deep
sand
covered
with
blocks
of
chalk
rock
at
one
hour
and
three
quarters
the
valley
is
contracted
into
a
narrow
pass
between
low
hills
of
bearing
traces
of
very
violent
torrents
at
the
end
of
two
hours
route
east
by
north
we
quitted
the
valley
and
crossed
a
rough
rocky
plain
intersected
on
every
side
by
beds
of
torrents
and
at
two
hours
and
three
quarters
halted
near
a
rock
one
of
the
guides
went
with
the
camels
up
a
side
valley
to
bring
water
from
the
well
hadhra
arabic
perhaps
the
hazeroth
hebrew
mentioned
in
numbers
xxxiii
distant
about
two
miles
from
the
halting
place
near
the
well
are
said
to
be
some
date
trees
and
the
remains
of
walls
which
formerly
enclosed
a
few
plantations
we
here
met
some
towara
bedouins
on
their
way
to
cairo
with
charcoal
after
employing
a
considerable
time
in
collecting
the
wood
and
burning
it
into
coal
they
carry
it
to
cairo
a
journey
at
least
of
ten
days
and
there
sell
it
for
three
or
four
dollars
per
load
so
cheap
do
they
hold
their
labour
and
so
limited
are
their
means
of
subsistence
in
return
they
bring
home
corn
and
clothes
to
their
women
and
children
we
started
again
as
soon
as
the
camels
returned
from
the
well
but
should
probably
have
gone
astray
had
not
the
bedouins
above
mentioned
pointed
out
the
road
we
ought
to
take
for
szaleh
the
uncle
of
hamd
although
he
pretended
to
be
quite
at
home
in
this
district
gave
evident
proofs
of
being
but
very
slightly
acquainted
with
it
we
made
many
windings
between
rocks
which
presented
their
smooth
perpendicular
sides
to
the
road
some
of
them
are
of
a
red
others
of
a
white
colour
the
ground
was
deeply
covered
with
sand
the
traces
of
torrents
were
observable
on
the
rocks
as
high
as
three
and
four
feet
above
the
boszeyra
present
level
of
the
plain
our
main
direction
was
at
four
hours
and
three
quarters
from
the
time
we
set
out
in
the
morning
we
entered
wady
rahab
arabic
a
fine
valley
with
many
syale
trees
where
the
sands
terminate
route
at
five
hours
and
a
half
we
entered
another
valley
broader
than
the
former
where
i
again
found
an
alternation
of
and
granite
the
barrenness
of
this
district
was
greater
than
i
had
yet
witnessed
in
my
travels
excepting
perhaps
some
parts
of
the
desert
el
tyh
the
nubian
valleys
might
be
called
pleasure
grounds
in
comparison
not
the
smallest
green
leaf
could
be
discovered
and
the
thorny
mimosa
which
retains
its
verdure
in
the
tropical
deserts
of
nubia
with
very
little
supply
of
moisture
was
here
entirely
withered
and
so
dry
that
it
caught
fire
from
the
lighted
cinders
which
fell
from
our
pipes
as
we
passed
we
continued
to
descend
by
a
gentle
slope
and
at
six
hours
and
a
half
entered
wady
samghy
arabic
coming
from
the
south
in
which
we
descended
at
the
end
of
eight
hours
and
a
half
we
left
this
valley
and
turned
into
a
side
one
called
boszeyra
arabic
where
we
halted
for
the
night
at
eight
hours
and
three
quarters
we
had
met
in
wady
samghy
two
old
bedouins
of
the
mezeine
tribe
who
belong
to
the
towara
nation
they
were
fishermen
on
their
way
to
the
sea
to
exercise
their
profession
one
of
them
carried
in
a
small
sack
a
measure
of
meal
which
was
to
serve
for
their
food
on
shore
the
other
had
a
skin
of
water
upon
his
shoulder
they
were
both
half
naked
and
both
approaching
to
seventy
years
of
age
one
of
them
was
deaf
but
so
intelligent
that
it
was
easy
to
talk
with
him
by
signs
he
had
established
a
vocabulary
of
gestures
with
his
companion
who
had
been
his
fishing
partner
for
ten
years
and
who
was
one
of
the
shrewdest
and
hardiest
bedouins
i
had
ever
seen
in
his
younger
days
he
had
been
a
noted
robber
and
in
attempting
to
carry
off
the
baggage
of
a
french
officer
in
the
sherkyeh
province
in
egypt
he
was
seized
laid
under
the
stick
and
so
severely
beaten
that
his
back
had
from
that
time
become
bent
but
notwithstanding
this
misfortune
and
his
age
he
had
lost
none
of
his
spirits
and
his
robust
constitution
still
enabled
him
to
cross
these
mountains
on
foot
and
to
exert
his
activity
whenever
it
was
required
these
two
men
partook
this
evening
of
my
supper
they
of
course
asked
me
where
i
was
going
and
shook
their
heads
when
i
told
them
i
was
bound
for
akaba
none
of
my
guides
knew
what
business
i
had
there
but
they
supposed
that
i
had
some
verbal
message
to
deliver
to
the
turkish
aga
who
was
at
the
head
of
the
garrison
ayd
es
szaheny
arabic
the
old
robber
soon
found
out
that
my
guide
szaleh
knew
little
of
the
road
and
still
less
of
the
arab
tribes
before
us
he
plainly
told
him
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
ensure
either
my
safety
or
his
own
in
passing
through
their
districts
and
reproached
him
for
having
deluded
me
with
false
assurances
there
appeared
to
be
so
much
good
faith
and
sense
in
all
the
old
man
said
and
i
found
him
so
well
informed
respecting
the
country
that
i
soon
determined
to
engage
him
to
join
us
but
as
we
were
to
descend
the
next
morning
by
the
same
road
to
the
i
deferred
making
him
any
overtures
till
we
should
arrive
there
the
wady
boszeyra
is
enclosed
by
gray
granite
rocks
out
of
which
the
towara
arabs
sometimes
hew
stones
for
hand
mills
which
they
dispose
of
to
the
northern
arabs
and
transport
for
sale
as
far
as
khalyl
it
is
very
seldom
that
any
arabs
pasture
in
the
district
we
had
traversed
from
wady
sal
the
towara
find
better
pasturage
in
the
southern
and
parts
of
the
peninsula
and
as
its
whole
population
is
very
small
the
more
barren
parts
of
it
are
abandoned
and
especially
this
side
where
very
few
wells
are
found
wasta
may
boszeyra
we
crossed
a
short
ridge
of
mountains
and
then
entered
a
narrow
valley
the
bed
of
a
torrent
called
saada
arabic
in
the
windings
of
which
we
descended
by
a
steeper
slope
than
any
of
the
former
our
main
direction
the
mountains
on
both
sides
were
of
moderate
height
and
with
gentle
slopes
till
after
an
hour
and
a
half
when
we
reached
a
chain
of
high
and
perpendicular
grünstein
rocks
which
hemmed
in
the
valley
so
closely
as
to
leave
in
several
places
a
passage
of
only
ten
feet
across
after
proceeding
for
a
mile
in
this
very
striking
and
majestic
defile
i
caught
the
first
glimpse
of
the
gulf
of
akaba
the
valley
then
widens
and
descends
to
the
sea
and
after
two
hours
and
a
quarter
we
alighted
upon
the
sandy
beach
which
is
here
several
hundred
paces
in
breadth
the
grünstein
and
granite
rocks
reach
all
the
way
down
but
at
the
very
foot
of
the
mountain
a
thin
layer
of
chalk
appeared
just
above
the
surface
of
the
ground
the
valley
opens
directly
upon
the
sea
into
which
it
empties
its
torrent
when
heavy
rains
fall
some
groves
of
stand
close
by
the
shore
among
which
is
a
well
of
brackish
but
drinkable
water
the
place
is
called
el
noweyba
arabic
we
now
followed
the
coast
in
a
direction
and
at
the
end
of
three
hours
and
a
quarter
halted
at
a
grove
of
intermixed
with
a
few
tamarisks
called
wasta
arabic
close
by
the
sea
here
is
a
small
spring
at
a
distance
of
fifty
yards
from
the
sea
and
not
more
than
eight
feet
above
the
level
of
the
water
it
was
choked
with
sand
which
we
removed
and
on
digging
a
hole
about
three
feet
deep
and
one
foot
in
diameter
it
filled
in
half
an
hour
with
very
tolerable
water
the
shore
is
covered
with
weeds
brought
hither
by
the
tide
here
the
two
bedouins
intended
to
take
up
their
quarters
for
fishing
but
i
easily
prevailed
upon
ayd
to
accompany
us
farther
on
he
promised
to
conduct
us
as
far
as
taba
a
valley
in
sight
of
akaba
but
declared
that
he
should
not
be
justified
in
holding
out
to
me
promises
of
safety
beyond
that
point
this
was
all
that
i
wished
for
the
present
thinking
that
when
we
arrived
thither
i
should
be
able
to
prevail
on
him
to
continue
farther
szaleh
now
gave
me
reason
to
suspect
that
from
the
moment
of
our
setting
out
he
had
had
treacherous
intentions
he
secretly
endeavoured
to
persuade
hamd
to
return
and
finding
the
latter
resolved
to
fulfil
his
engagements
he
declared
that
he
had
now
shown
us
enough
of
the
way
that
we
had
only
to
follow
the
shore
to
reach
akaba
and
that
the
weakness
of
his
camel
would
not
allow
it
to
proceed
farther
i
replied
that
he
was
at
liberty
to
take
himself
off
but
that
on
my
return
to
the
convent
i
should
pay
him
only
for
the
three
days
he
had
travelled
with
me
this
was
not
to
his
liking
and
he
therefore
preferred
going
on
before
we
left
this
place
ayd
told
me
that
as
i
had
treated
him
with
a
supper
last
night
it
was
his
duty
to
give
me
a
breakfast
this
morning
while
he
kneaded
a
loaf
of
flour
and
baked
it
in
the
ashes
his
companion
caught
some
fish
which
we
boiled
and
made
a
soup
of
the
broth
mixed
with
bread
the
deaf
man
was
made
to
understand
by
signs
that
he
was
to
wait
for
the
return
of
ayd
and
we
set
out
together
before
before
us
lay
a
small
bay
which
we
skirted
the
sands
on
the
shore
every
where
bore
the
impression
of
the
passage
of
serpents
crossing
each
other
in
many
directions
and
some
of
them
appeared
to
be
made
by
animals
whose
bodies
could
not
be
less
than
two
inches
in
diameter
ayd
told
me
that
serpents
were
very
common
in
these
parts
that
the
fishermen
were
much
afraid
of
them
and
extinguished
their
fires
in
the
evening
before
they
went
to
sleep
because
the
light
was
known
to
attract
them
as
serpents
are
so
numerous
on
this
side
they
are
probably
not
deficient
towards
the
head
of
the
gulf
on
its
opposite
shore
where
it
appears
that
the
israelites
passed
when
they
journeyed
from
mount
hor
by
the
way
of
the
red
sea
to
compass
the
land
of
edom
and
when
the
sent
fiery
serpents
among
the
numbers
xxi
the
following
passage
of
deuteronomy
viii
in
giving
a
general
description
of
this
country
alludes
to
the
serpents
led
thee
through
that
great
and
terrible
wilderness
wherein
were
fiery
serpents
and
scorpions
and
drought
where
there
was
no
water
who
brought
thee
forth
water
out
of
the
rock
of
flint
who
fed
thee
in
the
wilderness
with
manna
scorpions
are
numerous
in
all
the
adjacent
parts
of
palestine
and
the
desert
the
author
observes
in
a
note
in
another
place
that
the
arabic
translation
of
the
pentateuch
has
of
burning
bites
instead
of
note
of
the
editor
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
gulf
the
mountains
appeared
to
reach
down
to
the
in
the
direction
and
they
are
high
to
the
northward
the
chain
lowers
and
from
the
point
towards
akaba
the
level
is
still
lower
we
saw
at
a
distance
several
gazelles
which
my
guides
told
me
descend
at
to
the
sea
to
bathe
at
one
hour
from
wasta
we
reached
near
the
sea
another
collection
of
palm
trees
larger
than
the
former
and
having
a
well
which
was
completely
choaked
up
these
trees
receive
no
other
irrigation
than
the
winter
rains
each
tree
has
its
acknowledged
owner
among
some
of
the
towara
tribes
those
which
i
have
just
noticed
belong
to
some
persons
of
the
tribe
of
aleygat
not
the
smallest
attention
is
paid
to
the
trees
till
the
period
of
the
date
harvest
when
the
owners
encamp
under
them
with
their
families
for
about
a
week
while
the
fruit
is
gathered
the
shrub
gharkad
also
grows
here
in
large
quantities
at
one
hour
and
three
quarters
we
came
to
another
small
bay
round
which
lay
the
road
the
main
direction
of
the
shore
being
by
the
mountains
approach
very
near
to
the
water
leaving
only
a
narrow
sloping
plain
covered
with
loose
stones
washed
down
from
above
by
the
torrents
the
road
was
profusely
strewed
with
shells
of
different
species
all
of
which
were
empty
the
fishermen
collect
the
shells
take
out
the
animals
and
wady
om
hash
dry
them
in
the
sun
particularly
that
of
the
species
called
zorombat
arabic
which
i
have
also
seen
in
plenty
on
the
african
coast
of
the
red
sea
north
of
souakin
and
at
djidda
where
they
are
much
esteemed
by
the
mariners
and
are
sold
by
the
fishermen
at
tor
and
suez
i
here
made
a
rough
measurement
of
the
breadth
of
the
gulf
having
assumed
a
base
of
seven
hundred
paces
along
the
beach
and
then
measured
with
my
compass
the
angles
formed
at
either
extremity
of
it
with
a
prominent
point
of
the
opposite
mountain
the
result
gave
a
breadth
of
about
twelve
miles
the
vegetation
appeared
to
be
much
less
impregnated
with
saline
particles
than
i
had
found
it
on
other
parts
of
the
coast
of
the
red
sea
at
two
hours
and
three
quarters
we
had
to
pass
round
the
bottom
of
another
bay
of
red
and
white
where
steep
rocks
advance
so
close
to
the
water
as
to
leave
only
a
narrow
path
at
three
hours
and
three
quarters
we
passed
an
opening
into
the
mountain
called
wady
om
hash
arabic
from
whence
a
torrent
descends
which
after
its
issue
from
the
mountain
spreads
to
a
considerable
distance
along
the
shore
and
produces
verdure
the
shrub
doeyny
arabic
grows
here
in
abundance
it
is
almost
a
foot
in
height
and
continues
green
the
whole
year
the
arabs
collect
and
burn
it
and
sell
the
ashes
at
khalyl
where
they
are
used
in
the
glass
manufactories
we
passed
on
our
left
several
similar
inlets
into
the
mountain
the
beds
of
torrents
but
my
guides
could
not
or
would
not
tell
their
names
the
bedouins
are
generally
averse
to
satisfying
the
curiosity
on
such
subjects
not
being
able
to
conceive
what
interest
he
has
in
informing
himself
of
mere
names
they
ascribe
to
repeated
questions
of
this
nature
improper
motives
some
cunning
is
often
required
to
get
proper
answers
and
they
frequently
give
false
names
for
no
other
reason
than
to
have
the
pleasure
of
deluding
the
enquirer
and
laughing
at
him
among
themselves
behind
his
back
ras
om
haye
at
four
hours
and
a
quarter
we
passed
wady
mowaleh
arabic
and
at
the
end
of
five
hours
and
three
quarters
reached
the
northern
point
of
the
last
mentioned
bay
formed
by
a
projecting
part
of
the
mountain
or
promontory
called
abou
burko
arabic
which
means
who
wears
a
face
veil
because
on
the
top
of
it
is
a
white
rock
which
is
thought
to
resemble
the
white
berkoa
or
face
veil
of
the
arab
women
and
renders
it
a
conspicuous
object
from
afar
noweyba
where
we
had
first
reached
the
shore
bore
from
hence
we
rested
for
the
night
in
a
pasturing
place
near
the
mountain
on
the
south
side
of
the
promontory
old
ayd
who
carried
his
net
with
him
brought
us
some
fish
his
dog
eat
the
raw
fish
and
his
master
told
me
that
the
dog
sometimes
passed
several
months
without
any
other
food
may
set
out
long
before
none
of
our
party
was
ever
more
ready
to
alight
or
to
take
his
supper
than
szaleh
and
none
more
averse
to
start
during
the
whole
way
he
was
continually
grumbling
and
endeavouring
to
persuade
the
others
to
turn
back
we
were
one
hour
in
doubling
the
abou
burko
a
chalky
rock
whose
base
is
washed
by
the
waves
on
the
other
side
we
passed
at
two
hours
in
the
bottom
of
a
small
bay
wady
zoara
arabic
where
a
few
date
trees
grow
and
a
well
of
saltish
water
is
found
unfit
to
drink
the
maritime
plain
was
here
nearly
two
miles
in
breadth
having
made
the
tour
of
another
bay
from
abou
burko
we
reached
at
three
hours
and
a
half
a
promontory
forming
its
northern
boundary
and
called
ras
om
haye
arabic
a
name
derived
from
the
great
quantity
of
serpents
found
there
some
of
which
ayd
told
me
were
venemous
we
however
saw
none
of
any
kind
the
whole
coast
of
the
aelanitic
gulf
from
ras
abou
mohammed
to
akaba
consists
of
a
succession
of
bays
separated
from
such
other
by
head
lands
the
ras
om
haye
forms
the
western
extremity
of
the
mountain
of
tyh
om
haye
whose
straight
and
regular
ridge
runs
quite
across
the
peninsula
and
is
easily
distinguished
from
the
surrounding
mountains
we
halted
at
the
end
of
five
hours
in
a
rocky
valley
at
the
foot
of
ras
om
haye
where
acacia
trees
and
some
grass
grow
ayd
assured
us
that
in
the
mountain
at
some
distance
was
a
reservoir
of
rain
water
called
om
hadjydjein
arabic
but
he
could
not
answer
for
its
containing
water
at
this
time
he
described
to
hamd
its
situation
and
the
way
to
it
with
a
view
of
persuading
him
to
go
and
fetch
some
water
for
us
but
his
description
was
so
confused
and
i
thought
contradictory
in
several
circumstances
and
withal
so
pompous
that
i
concluded
it
to
be
all
a
story
and
told
him
he
was
a
babbler
babbler
he
exclaimed
allah
no
body
in
my
whole
life
ever
called
me
thus
before
a
babbler
i
shall
presently
shew
you
which
of
us
two
deserves
that
he
then
seized
one
of
the
large
water
skins
and
barefooted
as
he
was
began
ascending
the
mountain
which
was
covered
with
loose
and
sharp
stones
we
soon
lost
sight
of
him
but
saw
him
again
farther
on
climbing
up
an
almost
perpendicular
path
an
hour
and
a
half
after
he
returned
by
the
same
path
carrying
on
his
bent
back
the
skin
full
of
water
which
could
not
weigh
less
than
one
hundred
pounds
and
putting
it
down
before
us
said
take
it
from
the
babbler
i
was
so
overcome
with
shame
that
i
knew
not
how
to
apologize
for
my
inconsiderate
language
but
when
he
saw
that
i
really
felt
myself
in
the
wrong
he
was
easily
pacified
and
said
nothing
more
about
it
till
night
when
seeing
me
take
a
hearty
draught
of
the
water
and
hearing
me
praise
its
sweetness
compared
with
the
brackish
water
of
the
coast
he
stopped
me
and
said
man
for
the
future
never
call
an
old
bedouin
a
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
gulf
the
mountains
recede
somewhat
from
the
shore
leaving
at
their
feet
a
sloping
plain
a
place
on
the
coast
called
hagol
arabic
bore
from
hence
b
s
it
is
a
fruitful
valley
by
the
water
side
with
large
date
plantations
which
were
clearly
discernible
it
is
in
possession
of
the
tribe
of
arabs
called
akraba
arabic
behind
them
in
the
mountains
dwells
the
strong
and
warlike
tribe
of
omran
arabic
hagol
is
one
long
journey
from
akaba
to
the
south
of
it
about
four
hours
is
a
similar
cluster
of
date
trees
called
el
hamyde
arabic
which
bore
from
us
the
mountains
on
that
coast
are
steep
with
many
peaks
no
arabs
live
on
the
western
coast
owing
to
the
scanty
pasturage
it
is
occasionally
visited
by
fishermen
and
others
who
come
to
collect
the
herb
from
which
the
soda
ashes
are
obtained
or
to
cut
wood
and
burn
it
into
charcoal
the
fishermen
are
very
poor
and
visit
the
coast
only
during
the
summer
months
they
cure
their
fish
with
the
salt
which
they
collect
on
the
southern
part
of
the
coast
and
when
they
have
thus
prepared
a
sufficient
quantity
of
fish
they
fetch
a
camel
and
transport
it
to
tor
or
suez
at
tor
a
load
of
the
fish
or
about
four
hundred
pounds
may
be
had
for
three
dollars
the
fishermen
prepare
also
a
sort
of
lard
by
cutting
out
the
fat
adhering
to
the
fish
and
melting
it
they
then
mix
it
with
salt
preserve
it
in
skins
and
use
it
all
the
year
round
instead
of
butter
both
for
cookery
and
for
anointing
their
bodies
its
taste
is
not
disagreeable
as
the
bedouins
prefer
the
upper
road
this
road
along
the
coast
is
seldom
visited
except
by
poor
pilgrims
who
have
been
cut
off
from
the
caravan
or
robbed
by
bedouins
and
who
being
ignorant
of
the
road
across
the
desert
to
cairo
sometimes
make
the
tour
of
the
whole
peninsula
by
the
sea
side
as
they
are
thus
sure
not
to
lose
their
way
and
in
seldom
fail
in
finding
pools
of
water
ayd
told
me
that
he
had
frequently
met
with
stragglers
of
this
description
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
hunger
wady
mezeiryk
from
hence
northwards
the
shore
runs
having
doubled
the
point
of
om
haye
we
found
on
the
other
side
after
again
passing
round
a
small
bay
at
five
hours
and
three
quarters
a
bank
of
sand
running
into
the
sea
to
a
considerable
distance
and
several
miles
in
breadth
it
is
called
wady
mokabelat
arabic
and
is
the
termination
of
a
narrow
wady
in
the
mountains
to
our
left
from
whence
issues
a
torrent
which
spreads
in
time
of
rain
over
a
wide
extent
of
ground
partly
rocky
and
partly
sandy
where
it
produces
good
pasturage
and
irrigates
many
acacia
trees
the
view
up
this
wady
or
inlet
of
the
mountain
is
very
curious
at
its
mouth
it
is
nearly
two
miles
wide
and
it
narrows
gradually
upwards
with
the
most
perfect
regularity
so
that
the
eye
can
trace
it
for
five
or
six
miles
when
it
becomes
so
narrow
as
to
present
only
the
appearance
of
a
perpendicular
black
line
at
six
hours
and
a
half
we
came
again
to
a
mountain
forming
a
promontory
called
djebel
sherafe
arabic
the
mountains
from
om
haye
northward
decline
considerably
in
height
the
highest
point
of
the
chain
appears
to
be
the
summit
above
noweyba
where
we
had
descended
to
the
shore
beyond
djebel
sherafe
we
found
the
road
along
the
shore
obstructed
by
high
cliffs
and
were
obliged
to
make
a
detour
by
entering
a
valley
to
the
west
called
wady
mezeiryk
arabic
we
ascended
through
many
windings
entered
several
lateral
valleys
and
descended
again
to
the
shore
at
the
end
of
eight
hours
and
a
half
at
a
point
not
more
than
half
an
hour
distant
from
where
we
had
turned
out
of
the
road
we
found
the
valley
mezeiryk
full
of
excellent
pasture
many
herbs
were
growing
in
it
and
the
acacia
trees
were
all
green
upon
enquiry
i
learnt
that
to
the
north
of
djebel
tyh
copious
rains
had
fallen
during
the
winter
while
to
the
south
of
it
there
had
been
very
little
for
the
last
two
years
and
in
the
eastern
parts
none
in
the
whole
way
from
the
convent
i
had
not
met
with
the
smallest
trace
of
antiquity
either
inscriptions
upon
the
rocks
by
the
or
any
other
labour
of
man
until
we
reached
the
summit
of
wady
mezeiryk
where
close
to
the
road
is
a
large
rock
which
seems
for
a
small
space
to
have
received
an
artificial
surface
upon
it
i
found
rude
drawings
of
camels
and
of
mountain
and
other
goats
resembling
those
which
i
had
before
seen
and
those
which
i
saw
afterwards
in
the
wady
mokatteb
no
inscriptions
were
visible
but
the
annexed
figures
were
drawn
between
the
animals
these
were
the
only
drawings
or
inscriptions
that
i
met
with
in
the
mountains
to
the
of
the
convent
although
i
passed
many
flat
rocks
well
suited
to
them
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
inscriptions
have
been
written
by
pilgrims
proceeding
to
mount
sinai
and
that
the
drawings
of
animals
which
are
executed
in
a
ruder
manner
and
with
a
less
steady
hand
are
the
work
of
the
shepherds
of
the
peninsula
we
find
only
those
animals
represented
which
are
natives
of
these
mountains
such
as
camels
mountain
and
other
goats
and
gazelles
but
principally
the
two
first
it
may
be
worthy
of
mention
in
this
place
that
among
the
innumerable
paintings
and
sculptures
in
the
temples
and
tombs
of
egypt
i
never
met
with
a
single
instance
of
the
representation
of
a
camel
at
thebes
in
the
highest
of
the
tombs
on
the
side
of
the
djebel
habou
called
abd
el
gorne
which
has
not
i
believe
been
noticed
by
former
travellers
or
even
by
the
french
in
their
great
work
i
found
all
the
domestic
animals
of
the
egyptians
represented
together
in
one
large
painting
upon
a
wall
forming
the
most
elaborate
and
interesting
work
of
the
kind
which
i
saw
in
egypt
a
shepherd
conducts
the
whole
herd
into
the
presence
of
his
master
who
inspects
them
while
a
slave
is
noting
them
down
yet
even
here
i
looked
in
vain
for
the
camel
and
i
had
occasion
to
remark
in
the
course
of
my
tour
that
the
present
bedouins
of
sinai
are
in
the
habit
of
carving
the
figures
of
goats
upon
rocks
and
in
grottos
niebuhr
observes
that
in
the
hieroglyphic
wady
taba
inscriptions
which
he
saw
in
the
ancient
burying
ground
not
far
distant
from
naszeb
he
found
figures
of
goats
upon
almost
every
inscribed
this
animal
is
not
very
frequent
in
the
hieroglyphic
inscriptions
of
egypt
from
the
point
where
we
descended
again
to
the
shore
we
followed
a
range
of
black
basaltic
cliffs
into
which
the
sea
has
worked
several
creeks
appearing
like
so
many
small
lakes
with
very
narrow
openings
towards
the
sea
they
are
full
of
fish
and
shells
at
the
end
of
nine
hours
and
a
half
we
had
passed
these
cliffs
and
reached
the
plain
beyond
upon
which
we
continued
our
route
near
the
shore
and
rested
for
the
night
at
ten
hours
and
a
quarter
under
a
in
the
vicinity
of
a
deep
brackish
well
which
we
were
obliged
to
excavate
in
order
to
procure
some
water
for
our
camels
they
having
drank
none
since
we
quitted
wasta
from
hence
the
promontory
of
om
haye
bore
this
plain
which
is
the
extremity
of
a
valley
descending
from
the
western
mountain
is
called
wady
taba
arabic
ayd
had
promised
to
conduct
me
to
this
spot
but
no
farther
nor
would
the
new
offers
which
i
now
made
induce
hire
to
advance
we
had
already
passed
beyond
the
limits
of
the
arabs
towara
which
terminate
on
this
side
of
wady
mokabelat
and
we
were
now
in
the
territory
of
the
heywat
who
have
a
very
bad
reputation
we
had
met
with
nobody
on
the
road
but
in
wady
mezeiryk
as
well
as
in
wady
taba
we
saw
footsteps
which
shewed
that
some
persons
must
have
passed
there
a
short
time
before
none
of
my
guides
were
acquainted
with
the
tribe
of
heywat
had
we
therefore
met
any
strong
party
of
them
they
would
certainly
have
stripped
us
although
not
at
war
with
the
towara
for
it
is
a
universal
practice
among
bedouins
to
plunder
all
passengers
who
are
unknown
to
them
and
not
attended
by
guides
of
their
own
tribe
provided
they
possess
akaba
any
thing
worth
seizing
szaleh
had
completely
deluded
both
myself
and
his
own
nephew
hamd
he
had
confidently
asserted
that
he
knew
the
heywat
well
and
that
the
first
individual
of
them
whom
we
should
meet
would
easily
be
prevailed
upon
to
join
our
party
and
to
serve
as
an
additional
protector
about
one
hour
before
us
was
another
promontory
beyond
which
we
knew
that
the
country
was
well
peopled
by
two
other
tribes
the
alowein
and
omran
who
are
the
masters
of
the
district
of
akaba
intrepid
robbers
and
allies
of
the
heywat
and
who
are
to
this
day
quite
independent
of
the
government
of
egypt
through
them
we
must
unavoidably
pass
to
reach
akaba
and
ayd
could
not
give
me
the
smallest
hope
of
being
able
to
cross
their
valleys
without
being
attacked
had
i
been
furnished
with
a
firmahn
from
mohammed
ali
pasha
i
should
have
repaired
at
once
to
the
great
sheikh
of
the
towara
and
obliged
him
to
send
for
some
heywat
or
omran
guides
who
might
have
ensured
my
safety
but
having
been
disappointed
in
this
respect
i
had
no
alternative
but
to
turn
back
hamd
it
is
true
bravely
offered
to
accompany
me
wherever
i
chose
to
go
though
he
knew
nothing
of
the
road
before
us
or
the
arabs
upon
it
but
i
saw
little
chance
of
success
and
knew
from
what
i
had
heard
during
my
journey
from
kerek
to
cairo
that
the
omran
not
only
rob
but
murder
passengers
ayd
had
seen
on
the
shore
the
footsteps
of
a
man
which
he
knew
to
be
those
of
a
fisherman
a
friend
of
his
who
had
probably
passed
in
the
course
of
this
day
had
we
met
with
him
he
might
have
served
as
our
guide
but
not
a
soul
was
any
where
to
be
seen
under
these
circumstances
i
reluctantly
determined
to
retrace
my
steps
the
next
day
but
instead
of
proceeding
by
the
shore
to
turn
off
into
the
mountains
and
return
to
the
convent
by
a
more
western
route
akaba
was
not
far
distant
from
the
spot
from
whence
we
returned
before
i
could
distinguish
a
black
line
in
the
plain
where
my
guides
clearly
saw
the
surrounding
the
castle
which
bore
it
could
not
be
more
than
five
or
six
hours
distant
before
us
was
a
promontory
called
ras
koreye
arabic
and
behind
this
as
i
was
told
there
is
another
beyond
which
begins
the
plain
of
akaba
the
castle
is
situated
at
an
hour
and
a
half
or
two
hours
from
the
western
chain
down
which
the
hadj
route
leads
and
about
the
same
distance
from
the
eastern
chain
or
lower
continuation
of
tor
hesma
a
mountain
which
i
have
mentioned
in
my
journey
through
the
northern
parts
of
arabia
petraea
the
descent
of
the
western
mountain
is
very
steep
and
has
probably
given
to
the
place
its
name
of
akaba
which
in
arabic
means
a
cliff
or
a
steep
declivity
it
is
probably
the
akabet
aila
of
the
arabian
geographers
makrizi
says
that
the
village
besak
stands
upon
its
summit
in
numbers
xxxiv
the
of
is
mentioned
which
appears
to
correspond
very
accurately
to
this
ascent
of
the
western
mountain
from
the
plain
of
akaba
into
this
plain
which
surrounds
the
castle
on
every
side
except
the
sea
issues
the
wady
el
araba
the
broad
sandy
valley
which
leads
towards
the
dead
sea
and
which
i
crossed
in
at
a
day
and
a
half
or
two
days
journey
from
akaba
at
about
two
hours
to
the
south
of
the
castle
the
eastern
range
of
mountains
approaches
the
sea
the
plain
of
akaba
which
is
from
three
to
four
hours
in
length
from
west
to
east
and
i
believe
not
much
less
in
breadth
northward
is
very
fertile
in
pasturage
to
the
distance
of
about
one
hour
from
the
sea
it
is
strongly
impregnated
with
salt
but
farther
north
sands
prevail
the
castle
itself
stands
at
a
few
hundred
paces
from
the
sea
and
is
surrounded
with
large
groves
of
it
is
a
square
building
with
strong
walls
erected
as
it
now
stands
by
sultan
el
ghoury
of
egypt
in
the
sixteenth
century
in
its
interior
are
many
arab
huts
a
market
is
held
there
which
is
frequented
by
hedjaz
and
syrian
arabs
and
small
caravans
arrive
sometimes
from
khalyl
the
castle
has
tolerably
good
water
in
deep
wells
the
pasha
of
egypt
keeps
here
a
garrison
of
about
thirty
soldiers
to
guard
the
provisions
deposited
for
the
supply
of
the
hadj
and
for
the
use
of
the
cavalry
on
their
passage
by
this
route
to
join
the
army
in
the
hedjaz
cut
off
from
cairo
the
soldiers
of
the
garrison
often
turn
rebellious
three
years
ago
an
aga
made
himself
independent
and
whenever
a
corps
of
troops
passed
he
shut
the
gates
of
the
castle
and
prepared
to
defend
it
he
had
married
a
daughter
of
the
chief
of
the
omran
and
thus
secured
the
assistance
of
that
tribe
being
at
last
attacked
by
some
troops
sent
against
him
from
cairo
he
fled
to
his
tribe
and
escaped
into
syria
it
appears
that
the
gulf
extends
very
little
farther
east
than
the
castle
distant
from
which
one
hour
in
a
southern
direction
and
on
the
eastern
shore
of
the
gulf
lies
a
smaller
and
castle
inhabited
by
bedouins
only
called
kaszer
el
bedawy
at
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
from
akaba
and
the
same
distance
from
kaszer
el
bedawy
are
ruins
in
the
sea
which
are
visible
only
at
low
water
they
are
said
to
consist
of
walls
houses
and
columns
but
can
not
easily
be
approached
on
account
of
the
shallows
this
information
was
not
given
to
me
by
my
guides
but
after
my
return
to
cairo
by
some
french
mamelouks
in
the
army
of
mohammed
ali
pasha
who
had
formerly
been
for
several
weeks
in
garrison
at
akaba
they
however
had
never
seen
the
ruins
except
from
a
distance
i
enquired
particularly
whether
the
gulf
did
not
form
two
branches
at
this
extremity
as
it
has
always
been
laid
down
in
the
maps
but
i
was
assured
that
it
had
only
a
single
ending
at
which
the
castle
is
situated
to
the
north
of
akaba
in
the
mountain
leading
up
to
tor
hesma
is
a
wady
known
by
the
name
of
wady
ithem
arabic
i
was
told
that
at
a
certain
spot
this
valley
is
shut
up
by
an
ancient
wall
the
construction
of
which
is
ascribed
by
the
arabs
to
a
king
named
hadeid
whose
intention
in
erecting
it
was
to
prevent
the
tribe
of
beni
helal
of
nedjed
from
making
incursions
into
the
plain
by
this
valley
a
road
leads
eastwards
towards
nedjed
following
probably
a
branch
of
the
mountain
which
extends
towards
the
akaba
of
the
syrian
hadj
route
where
the
pilgrims
coming
from
damascus
descend
by
a
steep
and
difficult
pass
into
the
lower
plains
of
arabia
i
believe
this
chain
of
mountains
continues
in
a
direct
and
uninterrupted
line
from
the
eastern
shore
of
the
dead
sea
to
the
eastern
shore
of
the
red
sea
and
from
thence
to
yemen
makrizi
the
egyptian
historian
says
in
his
chapter
on
aila
akaba
is
from
hence
that
the
hedjaz
begins
in
former
times
it
was
the
frontier
place
of
the
greeks
at
one
mile
from
it
is
a
triumphal
arch
of
the
caesars
in
the
time
of
the
islam
it
was
a
fine
town
inhabited
by
the
beni
omeya
ibn
ahmed
ibn
touloun
a
sultan
of
egypt
made
the
road
over
the
akaba
or
steep
mountain
before
aila
there
were
many
mosques
at
aila
and
many
jews
lived
there
it
was
taken
by
the
franks
during
the
crusades
but
in
salaheddyn
transported
ships
upon
camels
from
cairo
to
this
place
and
recovered
it
from
them
near
aila
was
formerly
situated
a
large
and
handsome
town
called
aszyoun
arabic
eziongeber
my
guides
told
me
that
in
the
sea
opposite
to
the
above
mentioned
promontory
of
ras
koreye
there
is
a
small
island
they
affirmed
that
they
saw
it
distinctly
but
i
could
not
for
it
was
already
dusk
when
they
pointed
it
out
and
the
next
morning
a
thick
fog
covered
the
gulf
upon
this
island
according
to
their
statement
are
ruins
of
infidels
but
as
no
vessels
are
kept
in
these
parts
ayd
who
had
been
here
several
times
had
never
been
able
to
take
any
close
view
of
them
they
are
described
as
extensive
and
built
of
hard
stone
and
are
called
el
deir
convent
a
word
often
applied
by
arabs
to
any
ruined
building
in
which
they
suppose
that
the
priests
of
the
infidels
once
resided
the
bedouins
in
the
neighbourhood
of
akaba
as
i
have
already
observed
are
the
alouein
omran
and
heywat
they
are
all
three
entitled
to
a
passage
duty
from
the
hadj
caravan
the
alouein
exact
it
as
owners
of
the
district
extending
from
the
western
mountain
across
the
plain
to
akaba
the
heywat
as
the
possessors
of
the
country
from
the
well
of
themmed
to
the
summit
of
the
same
mountain
and
the
omran
as
masters
of
the
desert
from
akaba
southward
as
far
as
the
vicinity
of
moeleh
caravans
of
these
tribes
come
occasionally
to
cairo
in
search
of
corn
but
they
are
independent
of
the
pasha
of
egypt
of
which
they
give
proofs
by
continually
plundering
the
loads
of
the
hadj
caravans
and
of
all
those
who
pass
the
great
hadj
route
through
their
districts
their
intercourse
with
syria
especially
with
khalyl
is
much
more
frequent
than
with
cairo
we
had
had
through
the
whole
of
this
day
a
very
intense
simoum
or
wind
which
continued
also
during
the
night
in
the
evening
i
bathed
in
the
sea
but
found
myself
immediately
afterwards
as
much
heated
as
i
had
been
before
after
retiring
to
sleep
we
were
awakened
by
the
barking
of
dog
upon
which
ayd
springing
up
said
he
was
sure
that
some
people
were
in
the
neighbourhood
we
therefore
got
our
guns
ready
and
sat
by
the
fire
the
whole
night
for
whatever
may
be
the
heat
of
the
season
the
bedouin
must
have
his
fire
at
night
szaleh
gave
evident
signs
of
fear
but
happily
the
morning
came
without
realizing
his
apprehensions
may
still
expressed
his
certainty
that
somebody
had
wady
mezeiryk
approached
us
last
night
so
much
confidence
did
he
place
in
the
barking
of
his
dog
he
therefore
advised
me
to
hasten
my
way
back
as
some
arabs
might
see
our
footsteps
in
the
sand
and
pursue
us
in
quest
of
a
booty
on
departing
ayd
who
was
barefooted
and
whose
feet
had
become
sore
with
walking
took
from
under
the
round
which
we
had
passed
the
night
a
pair
of
leathern
sandals
which
he
knew
belonged
to
his
heywat
friend
the
fisherman
and
which
the
latter
had
hidden
here
till
his
return
in
order
to
inform
the
owner
that
it
was
he
who
had
taken
the
sandals
he
impressed
his
footstep
in
the
sand
just
by
which
he
knew
the
other
would
immediately
recognise
and
he
turned
the
toes
towards
the
south
to
indicate
that
he
had
proceeded
with
the
sandals
in
that
direction
we
now
returned
across
the
plain
to
the
before
mentioned
basalt
cliffs
passed
the
different
small
bays
and
turned
up
into
wady
mezeiryk
we
had
descended
from
our
camels
which
szaleh
was
driving
before
him
about
fifty
paces
in
advance
i
followed
and
about
the
same
distance
behind
me
walked
hamd
and
ayd
as
we
had
seen
nobody
during
the
whole
journey
and
were
now
returning
into
the
friendly
districts
of
the
towara
we
had
ceased
to
entertain
any
fears
from
enemies
and
were
laughing
at
ayd
for
recommending
us
to
cross
the
valleys
as
quickly
as
possible
my
gun
was
upon
my
camel
and
i
had
just
turned
leisurely
round
an
angle
of
the
valley
when
i
heard
ayd
cry
out
with
all
his
might
your
arms
here
they
are
i
immediately
ran
up
to
the
camels
to
take
my
gun
but
the
cowardly
szaleh
instead
of
stopping
to
assist
his
companions
made
the
camels
gallop
off
at
full
speed
up
the
valley
i
however
overtook
them
and
seized
my
gun
but
before
i
could
return
to
hamd
i
heard
two
shots
fired
and
at
him
are
we
not
towara
immediately
afterwards
i
saw
hamd
spring
djebel
sherafe
round
the
angle
his
eyes
flashing
with
rage
his
shirt
sprinkled
with
blood
his
gun
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
his
knife
covered
with
blood
his
foot
was
bleeding
he
had
lost
his
turban
and
his
long
black
hair
hung
down
over
his
shoulders
have
done
for
him
he
exclaimed
as
he
wiped
his
knife
let
us
without
ayd
said
i
indeed
he
replied
him
we
should
all
be
we
returned
round
the
corner
and
saw
ayd
exerting
his
utmost
agility
to
come
up
with
us
at
forty
paces
distance
an
arab
lay
on
the
ground
and
three
others
were
standing
over
him
we
took
hold
of
arm
and
hastened
to
our
camels
though
we
knew
not
where
to
find
them
szaleh
had
frightened
them
so
greatly
by
striking
them
with
his
gun
that
they
went
off
at
and
it
was
half
an
hour
before
we
reached
them
one
of
them
had
burst
its
girths
and
thrown
off
its
saddle
and
load
we
replaced
the
load
mounted
ayd
and
hastened
to
pass
the
rocks
of
djebel
sherafe
we
then
found
ourselves
in
a
more
open
country
less
liable
to
be
waylaid
amongst
rocks
and
better
able
to
defend
ourselves
hamd
now
told
me
that
ayd
had
first
seen
four
bedouins
running
down
upon
us
they
had
evidently
intended
to
waylay
us
from
behind
the
corner
but
came
a
little
too
late
when
he
heard
ayd
cry
out
he
had
just
time
to
strike
fire
and
to
light
the
match
of
his
gun
when
the
boldest
of
the
assailants
approached
within
twenty
paces
of
him
and
fired
the
ball
passed
through
his
shirt
he
returned
the
fire
but
missed
his
aim
while
his
opponent
was
coolly
reloading
his
piece
before
his
companions
had
joined
him
ayd
cried
out
to
hamd
to
attack
the
robber
with
his
knife
and
advanced
to
his
support
with
a
short
spear
which
he
carried
haind
drew
his
knife
rushed
upon
the
adversary
and
after
receiving
a
wound
in
the
foot
brought
him
to
the
ground
but
left
him
immediately
on
seeing
his
companions
hastening
to
his
relief
ayd
now
said
that
if
the
man
was
killed
we
should
certainly
be
pursued
but
that
if
he
was
only
wounded
the
others
would
remain
with
him
and
give
up
the
pursuit
we
travelled
with
all
possible
haste
not
knowing
whether
more
enemies
might
not
be
behind
or
whether
the
encampment
of
the
wounded
man
might
not
be
in
the
vicinity
from
whence
his
friends
might
collect
to
revenge
his
blood
ayd
had
certainly
not
been
mistaken
last
night
these
robbers
had
no
doubt
seen
our
fire
and
had
approached
us
but
were
frightened
by
the
barking
of
the
dog
uncertain
whether
we
were
proceeding
northward
or
southward
they
had
waited
till
they
saw
us
set
out
and
then
by
a
circuitous
route
in
the
mountains
had
endeavoured
unseen
to
get
the
start
of
us
in
order
to
waylay
us
in
the
passes
of
the
wady
mezeiryk
if
they
had
reached
the
spot
where
we
were
attacked
two
or
three
minutes
sooner
and
had
been
able
to
take
aim
at
us
from
behind
the
rock
we
must
all
have
inevitably
perished
that
they
intended
to
murder
us
contrary
to
the
usual
practice
of
bedouins
is
easily
accounted
for
they
knew
from
the
situation
of
the
place
where
they
discovered
us
as
well
as
from
the
dress
and
appearance
of
my
guides
that
they
were
towara
bedouins
but
though
i
was
poorly
dressed
they
must
have
recognized
me
to
be
a
townsman
and
a
townsman
is
always
supposed
by
bedouins
to
carry
money
with
him
to
rob
us
without
resistance
was
impossible
their
number
being
too
small
or
supposing
this
had
succeeded
and
any
of
the
guides
had
escaped
they
knew
that
they
would
sooner
or
later
be
obliged
to
restore
the
property
taken
and
to
pay
the
fine
of
blood
and
wounds
because
the
towara
were
then
at
peace
with
all
their
neighbours
for
these
reasons
they
had
no
doubt
resolved
to
kill
the
whole
party
as
the
only
effectual
mode
of
avoiding
all
disclosures
as
to
the
real
perpetrators
of
the
murder
i
do
not
believe
that
such
atrocities
often
occur
in
the
eastern
desert
noweyba
among
the
great
aeneze
tribe
at
least
i
never
heard
of
any
but
these
heywat
arabs
are
notorious
for
their
bad
faith
and
never
hesitate
to
kill
those
who
do
not
travel
under
the
protection
of
their
own
people
or
their
well
known
friends
scarcely
any
other
bedouin
robbers
would
have
fired
till
they
had
summoned
us
to
give
up
our
baggage
and
had
received
a
shot
for
answer
i
had
at
first
intended
to
visit
on
my
return
the
upper
mountains
to
which
there
is
a
road
leading
through
the
wady
mokabelat
but
ayd
dissuaded
me
he
said
that
if
the
party
from
which
we
had
just
escaped
meant
to
pursue
us
they
would
probably
lay
in
wait
for
us
in
some
of
the
passes
in
that
direction
as
he
did
not
doubt
that
it
would
be
their
belief
that
we
were
bound
for
tor
or
suez
the
nearest
road
to
which
places
lies
through
the
wady
mokabelat
i
yielded
to
his
opinion
and
we
returned
along
the
coast
by
the
same
road
we
had
come
wound
was
not
dangerous
i
dressed
it
as
well
as
i
could
and
four
days
afterwards
it
was
nearly
healed
we
travelled
a
part
of
the
night
and
may
the
next
morning
we
again
reached
noweyba
the
place
where
we
had
first
reached
the
coast
we
here
met
deaf
friend
szaleh
had
all
the
way
betrayed
the
most
timorous
disposition
in
excuse
for
running
away
when
we
were
attacked
he
said
that
he
intended
to
halt
farther
on
in
the
wady
in
order
to
cover
our
retreat
and
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
run
after
the
camels
which
were
frightened
by
the
firing
but
the
truth
was
that
his
terrors
deprived
him
of
all
power
of
reflection
otherwise
he
must
have
known
that
the
only
course
to
be
pursued
in
the
desert
when
suddenly
attacked
is
to
fight
for
life
as
escape
is
almost
impossible
having
been
foiled
in
my
hopes
of
visiting
akaba
i
now
wished
to
follow
the
shore
of
the
gulf
to
the
southward
but
szaleh
would
not
hear
of
any
farther
progress
in
that
direction
and
insisted
upon
wady
djereimele
my
going
back
to
the
convent
i
told
him
that
his
company
had
been
of
too
little
use
to
me
to
make
me
desirous
of
keeping
him
any
longer
he
therefore
returned
no
doubt
in
great
haste
by
the
same
route
we
had
come
accompanied
by
the
deaf
man
i
engaged
ayd
to
conduct
us
along
the
coast
hamd
being
very
ignorant
of
this
part
of
the
peninsula
where
his
tribe
the
oulad
sayd
never
encamp
the
date
trees
of
noweyba
belong
to
the
tribe
of
mezeine
here
were
several
huts
built
of
stones
and
branches
of
the
trees
in
which
the
owners
live
with
their
families
during
the
the
narrow
plain
which
rises
here
from
the
sea
to
the
mountain
is
covered
with
sand
and
loose
stones
ayd
told
me
that
in
summer
when
the
wind
is
strong
a
hollow
sound
is
sometimes
heard
here
as
if
coming
from
the
upper
country
the
arabs
say
that
the
spirit
of
moses
then
descends
from
mount
sinai
and
in
flying
across
the
sea
bids
a
farewell
to
his
beloved
mountains
we
rode
from
noweyba
round
a
bay
the
southern
point
of
which
bore
from
thence
by
in
two
hours
and
three
quarters
from
noweyba
we
doubled
the
point
and
rested
for
the
night
in
a
valley
just
behind
it
called
wady
djereimele
arabic
thickly
overgrown
with
the
shrub
gharkad
the
berries
of
which
are
gathered
in
great
abundance
red
coral
is
very
common
on
this
part
of
the
coast
in
the
evening
i
saw
a
great
number
of
shellfish
leave
the
water
and
crawl
to
one
hundred
or
two
hundred
paces
inland
where
they
passed
the
night
and
at
returned
to
the
sea
during
the
last
two
days
of
our
return
from
the
northward
i
had
found
no
opportunity
to
take
notes
i
had
never
permitted
my
companions
to
see
me
write
because
i
knew
that
if
their
suspicions
were
once
raised
it
would
at
least
render
them
much
less
open
in
their
communications
to
me
it
has
indeed
been
a
constant
maxim
with
me
never
to
write
before
arabs
on
the
road
at
least
i
have
departed
from
it
in
a
very
few
instances
only
in
syria
and
on
the
nile
in
my
first
journey
into
nubia
but
never
in
the
interior
of
nubia
or
in
the
hedjaz
had
i
visited
the
convent
of
mount
sinai
in
the
character
of
a
frank
with
the
firmahn
and
had
returned
as
travellers
usually
do
from
thence
to
cairo
i
should
not
have
hesitated
to
take
notes
openly
because
the
towara
arabs
dread
the
pasha
and
dare
not
insult
or
molest
any
one
under
his
protection
but
wishing
to
penetrate
into
a
part
of
the
country
occupied
by
other
tribes
it
became
of
importance
to
conceal
my
pursuits
lest
i
should
be
thought
a
necromancer
or
in
search
of
treasures
in
such
cases
many
little
stratagems
must
be
resorted
to
by
the
traveller
not
to
lose
entirely
the
advantage
of
making
memoranda
on
the
spot
i
had
accustomed
myself
to
write
when
mounted
on
my
camel
and
proceeding
at
an
easy
walk
throwing
the
wide
arab
mantle
over
my
head
as
if
to
protect
myself
from
the
sun
as
the
arabs
do
i
could
write
under
it
unobserved
even
if
another
person
rode
close
by
me
my
journal
books
being
about
four
inches
long
and
three
broad
were
easily
carried
in
a
waistcoat
pocket
and
when
taken
out
could
be
concealed
in
the
palm
of
the
hand
sometimes
i
descended
from
my
camel
and
walking
a
little
in
front
of
my
companions
wrote
down
a
few
words
without
stopping
when
halting
i
lay
down
as
if
to
sleep
threw
my
mantle
over
me
and
could
thus
write
unseen
under
it
at
other
times
i
feigned
to
go
aside
to
answer
a
call
of
nature
and
then
couched
down
in
the
arab
manner
hidden
under
my
cloak
this
evening
i
had
recourse
to
the
last
method
but
having
many
observations
to
note
i
remained
so
long
absent
from
my
companions
that
curiosity
was
roused
he
came
to
look
after
me
and
perceiving
me
immoveable
on
the
spot
approached
on
and
came
close
behind
me
without
my
perceiving
him
i
do
not
know
how
long
he
had
remained
there
but
suddenly
lifting
up
my
cloak
he
detected
me
with
the
book
in
my
hand
is
this
he
exclaimed
are
you
doing
i
shall
not
make
you
answerable
for
it
at
present
because
i
am
your
companion
but
i
shall
talk
further
to
you
about
it
when
we
are
at
the
i
made
no
answer
till
we
returned
to
the
when
i
requested
him
to
tell
me
what
further
he
had
to
say
write
down
our
country
he
replied
in
a
passionate
tone
mountains
our
pasturing
places
and
the
rain
which
falls
from
heaven
other
people
have
done
this
before
you
but
i
at
least
will
never
become
instrumental
to
the
ruin
of
my
i
assured
him
that
i
had
no
bad
intentions
towards
the
bedouins
and
told
him
he
must
be
convinced
that
i
liked
them
too
well
for
that
the
contrary
i
added
i
not
occasionally
written
down
some
prayers
ever
since
we
left
taba
we
should
most
certainly
have
been
all
killed
and
it
is
very
wrong
in
you
to
accuse
me
of
that
which
if
i
had
omitted
would
have
cost
us
our
he
was
startled
at
this
reply
and
seemed
nearly
satisfied
you
say
the
truth
he
observed
we
all
know
that
some
years
since
several
men
god
knows
who
they
were
came
to
this
country
visited
the
mountains
wrote
down
every
thing
stones
plants
animals
even
serpents
and
spiders
and
since
then
little
rain
has
fallen
and
the
game
has
greatly
the
same
opinions
prevail
in
these
mountains
which
i
have
already
mentioned
to
be
current
among
the
bedouins
of
nubia
they
believe
that
a
sorcerer
by
writing
down
certain
charms
can
stop
the
rains
and
transfer
them
to
his
own
country
the
travellers
to
whom
ayd
alluded
were
seetzen
who
visited
mount
sinai
eight
years
since
and
agnelli
who
ten
years
ago
travelled
for
the
emperor
of
austria
collecting
specimens
of
natural
history
and
who
made
some
stay
at
tor
from
whence
he
sent
arabs
to
hunt
for
all
kinds
of
animals
seetzen
traversed
the
peninsula
in
several
directions
and
followed
a
part
of
the
eastern
gulf
as
far
northward
i
believe
as
noweyba
this
learned
and
indefatigable
traveller
made
it
a
rule
not
to
be
intimidated
by
the
suspicions
and
prejudices
of
the
bedouins
beyond
the
jordan
on
the
shores
of
the
dead
sea
in
the
desert
of
tyh
in
this
peninsula
as
well
as
in
arabia
he
openly
followed
his
pursuits
never
attempting
to
hide
his
papers
and
pencils
from
the
natives
but
avowing
his
object
to
be
that
of
collecting
precious
herbs
and
curious
stones
in
the
character
of
a
christian
physician
in
the
holy
land
and
in
that
of
a
moslim
physician
in
the
hedjaz
if
the
knowledge
of
the
natural
history
of
syria
and
arabia
was
the
principal
object
of
researches
he
was
perfectly
right
in
the
course
which
he
adopted
but
if
he
considered
these
countries
only
as
intermediate
steps
towards
the
exploring
of
others
he
placed
his
ultimate
success
in
the
utmost
peril
and
though
he
may
have
succeeded
in
elucidating
the
history
of
the
brute
creation
he
had
little
chance
of
obtaining
much
information
on
the
human
character
which
can
only
be
done
by
gaining
the
confidence
of
the
inhabitants
and
by
accommodating
our
notions
views
and
manners
to
their
own
when
seetzen
visited
these
mountains
the
towaras
were
not
yet
reduced
to
subjection
by
mohammed
ali
he
was
obliged
on
several
occasions
to
pay
large
sums
for
his
passage
through
their
country
and
the
mezeine
would
probably
have
executed
a
plot
which
they
had
laid
to
kill
him
had
not
his
guides
been
informed
of
it
and
prevented
him
from
passing
through
their
territory
i
had
much
difficulty
in
soothing
ayd
he
remained
quiet
during
the
rest
of
the
journey
but
after
our
return
to
the
convent
the
ras
methna
report
spread
among
the
arabs
that
i
was
a
writer
like
those
who
had
preceded
me
and
i
thus
completely
lost
their
confidence
may
continued
along
the
coast
and
at
four
hours
passed
a
promontory
called
djebel
abou
ma
arabic
consisting
of
granite
from
hence
we
proceeded
by
and
at
seven
hours
came
to
a
sandy
plain
on
the
edge
of
a
large
sheltered
bay
we
found
here
some
bedouin
girls
in
charge
of
a
few
goats
they
told
us
that
their
parents
lived
not
far
off
in
the
valley
omyle
arabic
we
went
there
and
found
two
small
tents
where
three
or
four
women
and
as
many
little
children
were
occupied
in
spinning
and
in
collecting
herbs
to
feed
the
lambs
and
kids
which
were
frisking
about
them
ayd
knew
the
women
who
belonged
to
his
own
tribe
of
mezeine
their
husbands
were
fishermen
and
were
then
at
the
they
brought
us
some
milk
and
i
bought
a
kid
of
them
which
we
intended
to
dress
in
the
evening
the
women
were
not
at
all
bashful
i
freely
talked
and
laughed
with
them
but
they
remained
at
several
yards
distance
from
me
ayd
shook
them
by
the
hand
and
kissed
the
children
but
hamd
who
did
not
know
them
kept
at
the
same
distance
as
myself
higher
up
in
the
wady
is
a
well
of
good
water
called
tereibe
arabic
from
hence
we
went
by
and
at
eight
hours
came
to
ras
methna
arabic
a
promontory
whose
cliffs
continue
for
upwards
of
a
mile
close
by
the
water
side
granite
and
red
porphyry
here
cross
each
other
in
irregular
layers
in
some
places
horizontally
in
others
perpendicularly
the
granite
of
this
peninsula
presents
the
same
numberless
varieties
as
that
above
the
cataract
of
the
nile
and
near
assouan
and
the
same
beautiful
specimens
of
red
and
almost
purple
may
be
collected
here
as
in
that
part
of
egypt
the
transition
from
primitive
to
secondary
rocks
partaking
of
the
nature
of
grünstein
or
grauwacke
wady
methna
or
hornstein
and
trap
presents
also
an
endless
variety
in
every
part
of
the
peninsula
so
that
were
i
even
possessed
of
the
requisite
knowledge
accurately
to
describe
them
it
would
tire
the
patience
of
the
reader
masses
of
black
trap
much
resembling
basalt
compose
several
insulated
peaks
and
rocks
on
the
shore
the
granite
sand
carried
down
from
the
upper
mountains
has
been
formed
into
cement
by
the
action
of
the
water
and
mixed
with
fragments
of
the
other
rocks
already
mentioned
has
become
a
very
beautiful
breccia
at
the
end
of
eight
hours
and
three
quarters
we
rested
for
the
night
to
the
south
of
this
promontory
in
a
valley
still
called
wady
methna
from
some
fishermen
whom
we
met
i
bought
some
excellent
fish
of
a
species
resembling
the
turbot
and
very
common
on
this
coast
these
with
our
kid
furnished
an
abundant
repast
to
ourselves
as
well
as
to
the
fishermen
the
love
of
good
and
plentiful
fare
was
one
of
foibles
and
he
often
related
with
pride
that
in
his
younger
days
he
had
once
eaten
at
a
meal
with
three
other
bedouins
the
whole
of
a
mountain
goat
although
his
companions
as
he
observed
were
moderate
eaters
bedouins
in
general
have
voracious
appetites
and
whoever
travels
with
them
can
not
adopt
any
better
mode
of
attaching
them
to
his
interests
than
by
feeding
them
abundantly
and
inviting
all
strangers
met
with
on
the
road
to
partake
in
the
repast
pounds
given
as
presents
in
money
have
less
effect
than
shillings
spent
in
victuals
and
the
reputation
of
hospitality
which
the
traveller
thus
gains
facilitates
his
progress
on
every
occasion
my
practice
was
to
leave
the
provision
sack
open
and
at
the
disposal
of
my
guides
not
to
eat
but
when
they
did
not
to
take
the
choice
morsels
to
myself
to
share
in
the
cooking
and
not
to
give
any
orders
but
to
ask
for
whatever
i
wanted
as
a
favour
by
pursuing
this
method
i
continued
during
the
remainder
of
the
journey
to
be
on
the
best
terms
with
my
companions
dahab
and
had
not
the
slightest
altercation
either
with
hamd
or
ayd
on
the
eastern
shore
of
the
gulf
opposite
the
place
where
we
rested
lies
a
valley
called
mekna
arabic
inhabited
by
the
tribe
of
omran
close
to
the
shore
are
plantations
of
date
and
other
fruittrees
the
inhabitants
of
mekna
cross
the
gulf
in
small
boats
and
bring
to
this
side
sheep
and
goats
for
sale
of
which
they
possess
large
flocks
and
which
are
thus
more
plentiful
in
this
part
of
the
peninsula
than
in
any
other
the
mountains
behind
mekna
recede
from
the
sea
and
further
to
the
south
take
a
more
eastern
direction
so
as
to
leave
a
chain
of
hills
between
them
and
the
shore
rising
immediately
from
the
the
appearance
of
this
gulf
with
the
mountains
enclosing
it
on
both
sides
reminded
me
of
the
lake
of
tiberias
and
of
the
dead
sea
and
the
general
resemblance
was
still
further
heightened
by
the
hot
season
in
which
i
had
visited
all
these
places
may
road
lay
along
a
narrow
sandy
plain
by
the
sea
side
in
one
hour
and
a
half
we
reached
dahab
arabic
a
more
extensive
cluster
of
date
trees
than
i
had
before
seen
on
this
coast
it
extends
into
the
sea
upon
a
tongue
of
land
about
two
miles
beyond
the
line
of
the
shore
to
the
north
of
it
is
a
bay
which
affords
anchorage
but
it
is
without
protection
against
northerly
winds
dahab
is
probably
the
dizahab
mentioned
in
deut
i
there
are
some
low
hummocks
covered
with
sand
close
to
the
shore
of
the
low
promontory
probably
occasioned
by
the
ruins
of
buildings
the
plantations
of
date
trees
ar
e
here
enclosed
by
low
walls
within
many
of
which
are
wells
of
indifferent
water
but
in
one
of
them
about
feet
deep
and
fifty
yards
from
the
sea
we
found
the
best
water
i
had
met
with
on
any
part
of
this
coast
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
sea
about
two
miles
to
the
south
of
the
date
groves
are
a
number
of
shallow
ponds
into
which
the
sea
flows
at
hightide
here
the
salt
is
made
which
supplies
all
the
peninsula
as
well
as
the
fishermen
for
curing
their
fish
the
openings
of
the
ponds
being
closed
with
sand
the
water
is
left
to
evaporate
when
a
thick
crust
of
salt
is
left
which
is
collected
by
the
bedouins
dahab
is
a
favourite
resort
of
the
fishermen
who
here
catch
the
fish
called
boury
arabic
in
great
quantities
the
date
trees
of
dahab
which
belong
to
the
tribe
of
mezeine
and
aleygat
presented
a
very
different
appearance
to
those
of
egypt
and
the
hedjaz
where
the
cultivators
always
take
off
the
lower
branches
which
dry
up
annually
here
they
are
suffered
to
remain
and
hang
down
to
the
ground
forming
an
almost
impenetrable
barrier
round
the
tree
the
top
of
which
only
is
crowned
with
green
leaves
very
few
trees
had
any
fruit
upon
them
indeed
date
trees
in
general
yield
a
very
uncertain
produce
and
even
in
years
when
every
other
kind
of
fruit
is
abundant
they
are
sometimes
quite
barren
we
met
here
several
families
of
arabs
who
had
come
to
look
after
their
trees
and
to
collect
salt
in
the
midst
of
the
small
peninsula
of
dahab
are
about
a
dozen
heaps
of
stones
irregularly
piled
together
but
shewing
traces
of
having
once
been
united
none
of
them
is
higher
than
five
feet
the
arabs
call
them
kobour
el
noszara
or
the
tombs
of
the
christians
a
name
given
by
them
to
all
the
nations
which
peopled
their
country
before
the
introduction
of
the
islam
we
remained
several
hours
under
the
refreshing
shade
of
the
palm
trees
and
there
continued
our
road
in
crossing
the
tongue
of
land
i
observed
the
remains
of
what
i
conceived
to
be
a
road
or
causeway
which
began
at
the
mountain
and
ran
out
towards
the
point
of
the
peninsula
the
stones
which
had
formed
it
were
now
separated
from
each
other
but
lay
in
a
straight
line
so
as
to
afford
sufficient
proof
of
their
having
been
placed
here
by
the
wady
ghayb
labour
of
man
to
the
south
of
dahab
the
camel
road
along
the
shore
is
shut
up
by
cliffs
which
form
a
promontory
called
el
shedjeir
arabic
we
were
therefore
obliged
to
take
a
circuitous
route
through
the
mountains
and
directed
our
road
by
that
way
straight
towards
sherm
the
most
southern
harbour
on
this
coast
we
ascended
a
broad
sandy
valley
in
the
direction
this
is
the
same
wady
sal
in
which
we
had
already
travelled
in
our
way
from
the
convent
and
which
empties
itself
into
the
sea
in
the
rocky
sides
of
this
valley
i
observed
several
small
grottos
apparently
receptacles
for
the
dead
which
were
just
large
enough
to
receive
one
corpse
i
at
first
supposed
them
to
have
been
natural
erosions
of
the
rock
but
as
there
were
at
least
a
dozen
of
them
and
as
i
had
not
seen
any
thing
similar
in
other
rocks
i
concluded
that
they
had
been
originally
formed
by
man
and
that
time
had
worn
them
away
to
the
appearance
of
natural
cavities
we
left
the
valley
and
continued
to
ascend
slightly
through
windings
of
the
wady
beney
arabic
and
wady
ghayb
arabic
two
broad
barren
sandy
valleys
till
at
the
end
of
four
hours
we
reached
the
well
of
moayen
el
kelab
arabic
at
the
extremity
of
wady
ghayb
where
it
is
shut
up
by
a
cliff
here
is
a
small
pond
of
water
under
the
shade
of
an
impending
rock
and
a
large
wild
on
the
top
of
a
neighbouring
part
of
the
granite
cliff
is
a
similar
pond
with
reeds
growing
in
it
the
water
which
is
never
known
to
dry
up
is
excellent
and
acquires
still
greater
value
from
being
in
the
vicinity
of
a
spacious
cavern
which
affords
shade
to
the
traveller
this
well
is
much
visited
by
the
mezeine
tribe
on
several
trees
in
the
valley
leading
to
it
we
found
suspended
different
articles
of
bedouin
tent
furniture
and
also
entire
tent
coverings
my
guides
told
me
that
the
owners
left
them
here
during
their
absence
in
order
not
to
have
the
mofassel
el
korfa
trouble
of
carrying
them
about
and
such
is
the
confidence
which
these
people
have
in
one
another
that
no
instance
is
known
of
any
of
the
articles
so
left
having
ever
been
stolen
the
same
practice
prevails
in
other
parts
of
the
peninsula
the
cavern
is
formed
by
nature
in
a
beautiful
granite
rock
its
interior
is
covered
on
all
sides
with
figures
of
mountain
goats
drawn
with
charcoal
in
the
rudest
manner
they
are
done
by
the
shepherd
boys
and
girls
of
the
towaras
the
heat
being
intense
we
reposed
in
the
cavern
till
the
evening
when
after
retracing
our
road
for
a
short
distance
we
turned
into
the
wady
kenney
arabic
which
we
ascended
at
its
extremity
we
began
to
descend
in
a
wady
called
molahdje
arabic
a
narrow
steep
and
rocky
valley
of
difficult
passage
dog
started
a
mountain
goat
but
was
unable
to
come
up
with
it
we
slept
in
this
wady
at
one
hour
and
a
half
from
moayen
el
kelab
may
down
the
wady
widens
and
is
enclosed
by
high
granite
cliffs
its
direction
is
by
four
hours
continued
descent
brought
us
into
wady
orta
arabic
the
rocks
here
are
granite
red
porphyry
and
grünstein
similar
to
what
i
had
observed
towards
akaba
at
nearly
the
same
elevation
above
the
sea
at
the
end
of
six
hours
we
left
wady
orta
which
descends
towards
the
sea
and
turning
to
the
right
entered
a
large
plain
called
mofassel
el
korfa
arabic
in
which
we
rode
from
the
footsteps
in
the
sand
ayd
knew
the
individuals
of
the
mezeine
who
had
passed
this
way
in
the
morning
the
view
here
opened
upon
a
high
chain
of
mountains
which
extends
from
sherm
in
the
direction
of
the
convent
and
which
i
had
passed
on
my
return
from
arabia
in
going
from
sherm
to
tor
it
is
called
djebel
tarfa
arabic
and
is
inhabited
principally
by
the
mezeine
at
eight
hours
the
plain
widens
many
beds
of
torrents
coming
from
the
tarfa
cross
it
in
their
way
to
the
sea
this
sherm
part
is
called
el
arabic
and
excepting
in
the
beds
of
the
torrents
where
some
verdure
is
produced
it
is
an
entirely
barren
tract
at
nine
hours
we
approached
the
tarfa
between
which
and
our
road
were
low
hills
called
hodeybat
el
noszara
arabic
the
hump
backs
of
the
christians
the
waters
which
collect
here
in
the
winter
flow
into
the
sea
at
wady
nabk
at
ten
hours
the
plain
opens
still
wider
and
declines
gently
eastwards
to
the
sea
to
the
left
where
the
mountains
terminate
a
sandy
plain
extends
to
the
water
side
at
eleven
hours
is
an
insulated
chain
of
low
hills
forming
here
with
the
lowest
range
of
the
tarfa
a
valley
in
which
our
road
lay
and
in
which
we
halted
after
a
fatigueing
journey
of
twelve
hours
as
there
were
only
two
camels
for
three
of
us
we
rode
by
turns
and
ayd
regretted
his
younger
days
when
as
he
assured
us
he
had
once
walked
from
the
convent
to
cairo
in
four
days
the
hills
near
which
we
halted
are
called
roweysat
nimr
arabic
or
the
little
heads
of
the
tiger
may
descended
among
low
hills
and
after
two
hours
reached
the
harbour
of
sherm
arabic
this
is
the
only
harbour
on
the
western
coast
of
the
gulf
of
akaba
which
affords
safe
anchorage
for
large
ships
though
by
lying
close
in
shore
small
vessels
might
i
believe
find
shelter
in
several
of
the
bays
of
this
gulf
at
sherm
there
are
two
deep
bays
little
distant
from
each
other
but
separated
by
high
land
in
both
of
which
ships
may
lie
in
perfect
safety
on
the
shore
of
the
southern
bay
stands
the
tomb
of
a
sheikh
held
in
veneration
by
the
bedouins
and
mariners
a
small
house
has
been
built
over
it
the
walls
of
which
are
thickly
hung
with
various
offerings
by
the
bedouins
and
a
few
lamps
suspended
from
the
roof
are
sometimes
lighted
by
sailors
sherif
edrisi
in
his
geography
mentions
these
two
bays
of
sherm
and
calls
the
one
sherm
el
beit
arabic
or
of
the
house
and
the
other
sherm
el
bir
arabic
or
of
the
well
thus
accurately
describing
both
for
near
the
shore
of
the
northern
bay
are
several
copious
wells
of
brackish
water
deep
and
lined
with
stones
and
apparently
an
ancient
work
of
considerable
labour
the
distance
from
sherm
to
the
cape
of
ras
abou
mohammed
is
four
or
five
hours
on
the
way
a
mountain
is
passed
which
comes
down
close
to
the
sea
called
arabic
the
point
of
which
bears
from
sherm
by
bedouins
are
always
found
at
sherm
waiting
with
their
camels
for
ships
coming
from
the
hedjaz
whose
passengers
often
come
on
shore
here
in
order
to
proceed
by
land
to
tor
and
suez
the
arab
tribes
of
mezeine
and
aleygat
have
the
exclusive
right
of
this
transport
shortly
after
we
had
alighted
at
the
well
more
than
twenty
mezeine
came
down
from
the
mountain
with
their
camels
they
claimed
the
right
of
conducting
me
from
hence
and
of
supplying
me
with
a
third
camel
and
as
both
my
camels
belonged
to
arabs
of
the
tribe
of
oulad
sayd
they
insisted
upon
hamd
taking
my
baggage
from
his
camel
and
placing
it
upon
one
of
theirs
that
they
might
have
the
profits
of
hire
after
breakfasting
with
them
a
loud
quarrel
began
which
lasted
at
least
two
hours
i
told
them
that
the
moment
any
one
laid
his
hands
upon
my
baggage
to
remove
it
i
should
consider
it
as
carried
off
by
force
and
no
longer
my
property
and
that
i
should
state
to
the
governor
of
suez
that
i
had
been
robbed
here
although
they
could
not
all
expect
to
share
in
the
profits
arising
from
my
transport
every
one
of
them
was
as
vociferous
as
if
it
had
been
his
exclusive
affair
and
it
soon
became
evident
that
a
trifle
in
money
for
each
of
them
was
all
that
was
wanted
to
quiet
them
they
did
not
however
succeed
i
talked
very
boldly
told
them
that
they
were
robbers
and
that
they
should
be
punished
for
their
conduct
towards
me
at
last
their
principal
man
seeing
that
nothing
was
to
be
got
told
us
that
we
might
load
and
depart
he
accompanied
us
to
a
short
distance
and
received
a
handful
of
as
a
reward
for
his
having
been
less
clamorous
than
the
others
these
people
believed
that
my
visit
to
sherm
was
for
the
mere
purpose
of
visiting
the
tomb
of
the
saint
i
had
assigned
this
motive
to
ayd
who
was
himself
a
mezeine
telling
him
that
i
had
made
a
vow
to
thank
the
saint
for
his
protection
in
our
encounter
with
the
robbers
ayd
would
otherwise
have
been
much
astonished
at
my
proceeding
to
this
distance
without
any
plausible
object
the
nearest
road
from
sherm
to
the
convent
is
at
first
the
same
way
by
which
we
came
and
it
branches
off
northward
from
wady
orta
but
as
i
was
desirous
of
seeing
as
much
as
possible
of
the
coast
i
suggested
to
my
guides
that
if
we
proceeded
by
that
route
the
mezeine
of
sherm
might
possibly
ride
after
us
and
excite
another
quarrel
in
the
mountain
where
we
should
find
it
more
difficult
to
extricate
ourselves
they
consented
therefore
to
take
the
circuitous
route
along
the
shore
such
stratagems
are
often
necessary
in
travelling
with
bedouins
to
make
them
yield
to
the
wishes
for
though
they
care
little
for
fatigue
in
their
own
business
they
are
extremely
averse
to
go
out
of
their
way
to
gratify
what
they
consider
an
absurd
whim
of
their
companion
from
sherm
we
rode
an
hour
and
a
quarter
among
low
hills
near
the
shore
here
i
saw
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
this
peninsula
volcanic
rocks
for
a
distance
of
about
two
miles
the
hills
presented
perpendicular
cliffs
formed
in
half
circles
and
some
of
them
nearly
in
circles
none
of
them
being
more
than
sixty
to
eighty
feet
in
height
in
other
places
there
was
an
appearance
of
volcanic
craters
the
rock
is
black
with
sometimes
a
slight
red
appearance
full
of
cavities
and
of
a
rough
surface
on
the
road
lay
a
few
stones
which
had
separated
themselves
from
above
the
cliffs
were
covered
by
deep
layers
of
sand
and
the
valleys
at
their
feet
wady
szygha
were
also
overspread
with
it
it
is
possible
that
other
rocks
of
the
same
kind
may
be
found
towards
ras
abou
mohammed
and
hence
may
have
arisen
the
term
of
black
arabic
applied
to
these
mountains
by
the
greeks
it
should
be
observed
however
that
low
sand
hills
intervene
between
the
volcanic
rocks
and
the
sea
and
that
above
them
towards
the
higher
mountains
no
traces
of
lava
are
found
which
seems
to
shew
that
the
volcanic
matter
is
confined
to
this
spot
we
issued
from
the
low
hills
upon
a
wide
plain
which
extends
as
far
as
nabk
and
is
intersected
in
several
places
by
beds
of
torrents
our
direction
was
by
the
plain
terminates
three
or
four
miles
to
the
east
in
rocks
which
line
the
shore
at
the
end
of
three
hours
and
a
half
we
halted
under
a
rock
in
the
bed
of
one
of
the
torrents
the
whole
plain
appears
to
be
alluvial
many
petrified
shells
are
found
imbedded
in
the
chalky
and
calcareous
soil
in
the
afternoon
we
again
passed
several
low
in
the
plain
and
at
the
end
of
five
hours
wady
szygha
arabic
at
six
hours
and
a
half
from
sherm
we
rested
in
the
plain
in
a
spot
where
some
bushes
grew
amongst
which
we
found
a
bedouin
woman
and
her
daughter
living
under
a
covering
made
of
reeds
and
her
husband
and
son
were
absent
fishing
but
ayd
being
well
known
to
them
they
gave
us
a
hearty
welcome
and
milked
a
goat
for
me
after
sunset
they
joined
our
party
and
sitting
down
behind
the
bush
where
i
had
taken
up
my
quarters
eat
a
dish
of
rice
which
i
presented
to
them
the
daughter
was
a
very
handsome
girl
of
eighteen
or
nineteen
as
graceful
in
her
deportment
and
modest
in
her
behaviour
as
the
best
educated
european
female
could
be
indeed
i
have
often
had
occasion
to
remark
among
the
bedouins
comparing
them
with
the
women
of
of
the
most
polished
parts
of
europe
that
grace
and
modesty
are
not
less
than
beauty
the
gifts
of
nature
among
these
arabs
the
wady
nakb
men
consider
it
beneath
them
to
take
the
flocks
to
pasture
and
leave
it
to
the
women
in
front
of
our
halting
place
lay
an
island
called
djezyret
tyran
arabic
its
length
from
to
is
from
six
to
eight
miles
and
it
lies
about
four
miles
from
the
shore
half
its
length
is
a
narrow
promontory
of
sand
and
its
main
body
to
the
south
consists
of
a
barren
mountain
it
is
not
inhabited
but
the
bedouins
of
heteym
sometimes
come
here
from
the
eastern
coast
to
fish
for
pearls
and
remain
several
weeks
bringing
their
provision
of
water
from
the
spring
of
el
khereyde
arabic
on
that
coast
there
being
no
sweet
water
in
the
island
edrisi
mentions
a
place
on
the
western
coast
where
pearls
are
procured
a
circumstance
implied
by
the
name
of
maszdaf
arabic
which
he
gives
to
it
the
name
is
now
unknown
here
but
i
think
it
probable
that
edrisi
spoke
of
this
part
of
the
coast
the
quantity
of
pearls
obtained
is
very
small
but
the
heteym
pick
up
a
good
deal
of
which
they
sell
to
great
advantage
at
moeleh
to
the
ships
which
anchor
there
may
continued
over
the
plain
in
a
direction
by
and
in
two
hours
reached
wady
nabk
arabic
which
next
to
dahab
and
noweyba
is
the
principal
station
on
this
coast
large
plantations
of
date
trees
grow
on
the
among
which
as
usual
is
a
well
of
brackish
water
the
plain
which
reaches
from
near
sherm
to
nabk
is
the
only
one
of
any
extent
along
the
whole
coast
at
nabk
it
contracts
the
western
chain
approaches
to
within
two
miles
of
the
shore
and
farther
northward
this
chain
comes
close
to
the
sea
the
promontory
of
djebel
abou
ma
bore
from
wady
nabk
from
hence
to
dahab
as
the
arabs
told
me
is
about
six
hours
walk
along
the
shore
the
highest
point
of
the
mountain
upon
the
island
of
tyran
bore
by
the
opposite
part
of
the
eastern
coast
is
low
and
the
mountains
are
at
a
distance
inland
near
nabk
are
similar
to
those
at
dahab
except
during
the
date
harvest
nabk
is
inhabited
only
by
fishermen
they
are
the
poorest
individuals
of
their
tribe
who
have
no
flocks
or
camels
and
are
obliged
to
resort
to
this
occupation
to
support
themselves
and
families
we
bought
here
for
paras
or
about
halfpenny
salted
fish
each
about
two
feet
in
length
and
a
measure
of
the
dried
zorombat
which
in
this
state
the
arabs
call
bussra
for
the
smaller
kinds
of
fish
the
fishermen
use
which
they
throw
into
the
sea
from
the
shore
the
larger
species
they
kill
with
lances
one
of
which
ayd
carried
constantly
with
him
as
a
weapon
there
is
not
a
single
boat
nor
even
a
raft
to
be
found
on
the
whole
of
this
coast
but
the
bedouins
of
the
eastern
coast
have
a
few
boats
which
may
sometimes
be
seen
in
the
gulf
we
saw
here
a
great
number
of
porpoises
playing
in
the
water
close
to
the
shore
i
wished
to
shoot
at
one
of
them
but
was
prevented
by
my
companions
who
said
that
it
was
unlawful
to
kill
them
as
they
are
the
friends
of
man
and
never
hurt
any
body
i
saw
parts
of
the
skin
of
a
large
fish
killed
on
the
coast
which
was
an
inch
in
thickness
and
is
employed
by
these
arabs
instead
of
leather
for
sandals
we
now
turned
from
nabk
upwards
to
the
convent
and
in
half
an
hour
entered
the
chain
of
mountains
along
a
broad
valley
called
wady
nabk
in
which
we
ascended
slightly
and
rested
at
two
hours
and
a
quarter
from
nabk
under
a
large
acacia
tree
in
the
vicinity
were
three
tents
of
aleygat
arabs
the
women
of
which
approached
the
place
where
we
had
alighted
and
told
us
that
two
men
and
a
child
were
there
ill
of
the
plague
which
they
had
caught
from
a
relative
of
theirs
who
had
lately
come
from
egypt
with
the
disease
upon
him
and
who
had
died
at
that
time
they
were
wady
rahab
in
a
large
encampment
but
as
soon
as
the
infection
shewed
itself
their
companions
compelled
them
to
quit
the
camp
and
they
had
come
to
this
place
to
await
the
termination
of
the
disorder
my
guides
were
as
much
afraid
of
the
infection
as
i
was
and
made
the
women
remain
at
a
proper
distance
they
asked
me
for
some
rice
and
sugar
which
latter
article
they
believe
to
be
a
sovereign
remedy
against
diseases
i
was
glad
to
be
able
to
gratify
them
and
i
advised
them
to
give
the
patients
whey
which
is
almost
the
only
cooling
draught
the
arabs
know
they
conceive
that
almost
all
illnesses
proceed
from
cold
and
therefore
usually
attempt
to
cure
them
by
heat
keeping
the
patient
thickly
covered
with
clothes
and
feeding
him
upon
the
most
nourishing
food
they
can
afford
not
far
from
our
halting
place
on
the
ascent
of
the
mountain
is
a
reservoir
of
rain
water
where
we
filled
our
skins
the
acacia
trees
of
the
valley
were
thickly
covered
with
guin
arabic
the
towara
arabs
often
bring
to
cairo
loads
of
it
which
they
collect
in
these
mountains
but
it
is
much
less
esteemed
than
that
from
soudan
i
found
it
of
a
somewhat
sweet
and
rather
agreeable
taste
the
bedouins
pretend
that
upon
journeys
it
is
a
preventive
of
thirst
and
that
the
person
who
chews
it
may
pass
a
whole
day
without
feeling
any
inconvenience
from
the
want
of
water
we
set
out
in
the
afternoon
and
at
the
end
of
three
hours
and
a
half
from
wady
nabk
passed
the
mofassel
el
korfa
which
i
have
already
mentioned
at
four
hours
and
a
quarter
we
crossed
wady
el
orta
the
direction
of
our
road
by
and
at
the
end
of
five
hours
and
a
quarter
we
halted
in
wady
rahab
arabic
all
these
valleys
resemble
one
another
the
only
difference
of
appearance
which
they
afford
is
that
in
some
places
the
ground
is
parched
up
while
in
others
where
a
torrent
passes
during
the
winter
the
shrubs
still
retain
some
green
leaves
wady
orta
may
the
night
we
had
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
with
thunder
and
lightning
which
completely
drenched
both
ourselves
and
our
baggage
a
beautiful
morning
succeeded
and
the
atmosphere
which
during
the
last
three
days
had
been
extremely
hot
especially
on
the
low
coast
was
now
so
much
refreshed
that
we
seemed
to
have
removed
from
a
tropical
to
an
alpine
climate
we
passed
through
several
valleys
emptying
themselves
into
wady
orta
the
principal
of
these
is
called
wady
ertama
arabic
route
although
the
rain
had
been
heavy
the
sands
had
so
completely
absorbed
it
that
we
could
scarcely
find
any
traces
of
it
we
started
several
gazelles
the
only
game
i
have
seen
in
the
peninsula
except
hares
and
wolves
are
found
but
are
not
common
and
the
bedouins
sometimes
kill
leopards
of
one
of
which
i
obtained
a
large
skin
at
the
convent
the
bedouins
talk
much
of
a
beast
of
prey
called
wober
arabic
which
inhabits
the
most
retired
parts
only
of
the
peninsula
they
describe
it
as
being
of
the
size
of
a
large
dog
with
a
pointed
head
like
a
hog
i
heard
also
of
another
voracious
animal
called
shyb
arabic
stated
to
be
a
breed
between
the
leopard
and
the
wolf
of
its
existence
little
doubt
can
be
entertained
though
its
pretended
origin
is
probably
fabulous
for
the
arabs
and
especially
the
bedouins
are
in
the
common
practice
of
assigning
to
every
animal
that
is
seldom
met
with
parents
of
two
different
species
of
known
animals
on
the
coast
and
in
the
lower
valleys
a
kind
of
large
lizard
is
seen
called
dhob
arabic
which
has
a
scaly
skin
of
a
yellow
colour
the
largest
are
about
eighteen
inches
in
length
of
which
the
tail
measures
about
the
dhob
is
very
common
in
the
arabian
deserts
where
the
arabs
form
tobacco
purses
of
its
skin
it
lives
in
holes
in
the
sand
which
have
generally
two
openings
it
runs
fast
but
a
dog
easily
catches
it
of
birds
i
saw
partridges
in
great
numbers
pigeons
the
katta
but
not
in
such
large
flocks
as
i
wady
kyd
have
seen
them
in
syria
and
the
eagle
rakham
the
bedouins
also
mentioned
an
eagle
whose
outspread
wings
measure
six
feet
across
and
which
carries
off
lambs
after
four
hours
and
a
half
we
reached
wady
kyd
arabic
and
rested
at
its
entrance
under
two
immense
blocks
of
granite
which
had
fallen
down
from
the
mountain
they
form
two
spacious
caverns
and
serve
as
a
place
of
shelter
for
the
shepherdesses
we
saw
in
them
several
articles
of
tent
furniture
and
some
cooking
utensils
on
the
sides
figures
of
goats
are
drawn
with
charcoal
but
i
saw
no
inscriptions
cut
in
the
rock
the
blocks
are
split
in
several
places
as
if
by
lightning
we
followed
the
wady
kyd
continuing
on
a
gentle
ascent
from
the
time
of
our
setting
out
in
the
morning
the
windings
of
the
valley
led
us
at
the
end
of
five
hours
and
a
half
to
a
small
rivulet
two
feet
across
and
six
inches
in
depth
which
is
lost
immediately
below
in
the
sands
of
the
wady
it
drips
down
a
granite
rock
which
blocks
up
the
valley
there
only
twenty
paces
in
breadth
and
forms
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
a
small
pond
overshadowed
by
trees
with
fine
verdure
on
its
banks
the
rocks
which
overhang
it
on
both
sides
almost
meet
and
give
to
the
whole
the
appearance
of
a
grotto
most
delighful
to
the
traveller
after
passing
through
these
dreary
valleys
it
is
in
fact
the
most
romantic
spot
i
have
seen
in
these
mountains
and
worthy
of
being
frequented
by
other
people
than
arabs
upon
whom
the
beauties
of
nature
make
a
very
faint
impression
the
camels
passed
over
the
rocks
with
great
difficulty
beyond
it
we
continued
in
the
same
narrow
valley
along
the
rivulet
amidst
groves
of
date
nebek
and
some
tamarisk
trees
until
at
six
hours
we
reached
the
source
of
the
rivulet
where
we
rested
a
little
this
is
one
of
the
most
noted
date
valleys
of
the
sinai
arabs
the
contrast
of
its
deep
verdure
with
the
glaring
rocks
by
which
it
is
closely
hemmed
in
is
very
striking
and
shews
that
wherever
water
passes
in
these
districts
however
djebel
mordam
barren
the
ground
vegetation
is
invariably
found
within
the
enclosures
of
the
i
saw
a
few
patches
of
onions
and
of
hemp
the
latter
is
used
for
smoking
some
of
the
small
leaves
which
surround
the
being
laid
upon
the
tobacco
in
the
pipe
produces
a
more
intoxicating
smoke
the
same
custom
prevails
in
egypt
where
the
hemp
leaves
as
well
as
the
plant
itself
are
called
hashysh
in
the
branches
of
one
of
the
several
baskets
and
a
gun
were
deposited
and
some
camels
were
feeding
upon
the
grass
near
the
rivulet
but
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
in
the
valley
these
bedouins
being
under
no
fear
of
robbers
leave
their
goods
and
allow
their
beasts
to
pasture
without
any
one
to
watch
them
when
they
want
the
camels
they
send
to
the
springs
in
search
of
them
and
if
not
found
there
they
trace
their
footsteps
through
the
valleys
for
every
bedouin
knows
the
print
of
the
foot
of
his
own
camel
notwithstanding
its
verdure
the
wady
kyd
is
an
uncomfortable
place
on
account
of
the
great
number
of
gnats
and
ticks
with
which
it
is
infested
beyond
the
source
of
the
rivulet
which
oozes
out
of
the
ground
the
vegetation
ceases
and
the
valley
widens
we
rode
on
and
at
seven
hours
entered
wady
kheysy
a
wild
pass
in
which
the
road
is
covered
with
rocks
and
the
sides
of
the
mountains
are
shattered
by
torrents
we
ascended
through
many
windings
in
the
general
direction
of
until
we
found
the
valley
shut
up
by
a
high
mountain
called
djebel
mordam
arabic
the
rocks
are
granite
and
porphyry
in
many
parts
of
the
valley
grow
wild
called
by
the
arabs
hamad
here
also
grows
the
aszef
arabic
a
tree
which
i
had
already
seen
in
several
of
the
wadys
it
springs
from
the
fissures
in
the
rocks
and
its
crooked
stem
creeps
up
the
side
like
a
parasitic
plant
it
produces
according
to
the
arabs
a
fruit
of
the
size
of
a
walnut
of
a
blackish
colour
and
very
sweet
to
the
taste
the
bark
of
the
tree
mountain
of
mohala
is
white
and
the
branches
are
thickly
covered
with
small
thorns
the
leaves
are
and
of
the
same
shade
of
green
as
those
of
the
oak
this
wady
as
well
as
the
kyd
is
inhabited
by
mezeine
but
they
all
return
in
summer
to
the
highest
mountains
of
the
peninsula
where
the
pasture
is
more
abundant
than
in
these
lower
valleys
we
ascended
the
mordam
with
difficulty
and
on
the
other
side
found
a
narrow
valley
which
brought
us
at
the
end
of
eleven
hours
to
a
spring
called
tabakat
arabic
situated
under
a
rock
which
shuts
up
the
valley
the
spring
is
thickly
overgrown
with
reeds
and
sometimes
dries
up
in
summer
above
the
rock
extends
a
plain
or
rather
a
country
somewhat
more
open
intersected
with
hills
and
bounded
by
high
mountains
the
district
is
called
fera
el
adlial
arabic
and
is
a
favourite
pasturing
place
of
the
arabs
their
sheep
being
peculiarly
fond
of
the
little
berries
of
the
shrub
rethem
arabic
with
which
the
whole
plain
is
overspread
in
order
to
take
the
nearest
road
to
the
convent
we
ascended
in
a
direction
the
high
mountain
of
mohala
arabic
the
top
of
which
we
reached
at
the
end
of
eleven
hours
and
three
quarters
from
hence
the
convent
was
pointed
out
to
me
on
the
other
side
we
descended
into
a
narrow
valley
on
the
declivity
of
the
mountain
where
we
alighted
after
a
long
march
of
twelve
hours
and
a
quarter
this
mountain
is
entirely
of
granite
but
at
tabakat
beautiful
porphyry
is
seen
with
large
slabs
of
feldspath
traversed
by
layers
of
white
and
quartz
may
night
was
so
cold
that
we
all
lay
down
round
the
fire
and
kept
it
lighted
the
whole
night
early
in
the
morning
we
continued
to
descend
the
mountain
by
a
road
called
nakb
a
steep
declivity
is
called
by
the
bedouins
nakb
the
plural
of
which
ankaba
arabic
is
often
used
by
them
synonymously
with
djebal
arabic
mountains
haszfet
el
ras
abou
el
far
arabic
and
in
half
an
hour
reached
the
wady
ahmar
arabic
which
below
joins
the
wady
kyd
ascending
again
in
this
wady
we
came
in
an
hour
to
the
springs
of
abou
tereyfa
arabic
oozing
like
that
of
tabakat
from
below
a
rock
which
shuts
up
the
narrow
valley
on
the
declivity
of
the
mountains
farther
on
i
saw
many
ruins
of
walls
and
was
informed
by
my
guides
that
fifty
years
ago
this
was
one
of
the
most
fertile
valleys
of
their
country
full
of
date
and
other
fruit
trees
but
that
a
violent
flood
tore
up
all
the
trees
and
laid
it
waste
in
a
few
days
and
that
since
that
period
it
has
been
deserted
at
the
end
of
two
hours
and
a
half
we
descended
into
a
broad
valley
or
rather
plain
called
haszfet
el
ras
arabic
and
perceived
at
its
extremity
an
encampment
which
we
reached
at
three
hours
and
a
quarter
and
alighted
under
the
tent
of
the
chief
he
happened
to
be
the
same
bedouin
who
had
conducted
me
last
year
from
tor
to
cairo
and
who
had
also
brought
the
from
cairo
to
the
convent
i
knew
that
he
was
angry
with
me
for
having
discharged
him
on
my
arrival
at
the
latter
place
and
for
having
hired
hamd
to
conduct
me
to
akaba
he
was
already
acquainted
with
my
return
and
that
i
had
gone
to
sherm
but
little
expected
to
see
me
here
he
however
gave
me
a
good
reception
killed
a
lamb
for
my
dinner
and
would
not
let
me
depart
in
the
afternoon
another
arab
having
prepared
a
goat
for
our
supper
we
remained
therefore
the
whole
day
with
him
and
in
the
evening
joined
in
the
dance
and
songs
of
the
mesámer
which
were
protracted
till
long
and
brought
several
other
young
men
from
the
neighbouring
encampments
the
stranger
not
accustomed
to
bedouin
life
can
seldom
hope
to
enjoy
quiet
sleep
in
these
encampments
after
the
songs
and
dances
are
ended
he
must
lie
down
in
the
tent
of
his
host
with
a
number
of
men
who
think
to
honour
him
by
keeping
him
company
but
who
if
the
tent
is
not
very
large
wady
sebaye
lie
so
close
as
to
impart
to
him
a
share
of
the
vermin
with
which
they
are
sure
to
be
infested
to
sleep
in
the
open
air
before
the
tent
is
difficult
on
account
of
the
fierce
dogs
of
the
encampment
who
have
as
great
an
aversion
for
townsmen
as
their
masters
have
the
bedouins
too
dislike
this
practice
because
a
sight
of
the
female
apartment
may
thus
be
obtained
i
found
the
women
here
much
more
reserved
than
among
other
bedouins
i
could
not
induce
any
of
them
to
converse
with
me
and
soon
perceived
that
both
themselves
and
their
husbands
disliked
their
being
noticed
a
fastidiousness
of
manners
for
which
they
are
no
doubt
indebted
to
the
frequent
visits
of
their
husbands
to
the
capital
of
egypt
we
had
another
shower
in
the
night
flying
showers
are
frequent
during
the
summer
but
they
are
never
sufficiently
copious
in
that
season
to
produce
torrents
may
left
the
tent
before
dawn
and
proceeded
along
a
wady
and
then
up
an
ascent
whose
summit
we
reached
in
two
hours
from
thence
a
fine
view
opened
upon
a
broad
wady
called
sebaye
arabic
and
towards
the
mountain
of
tyh
we
crossed
wady
sebaye
and
then
ascended
the
mountain
which
commands
the
convent
on
the
south
side
and
descending
again
reached
the
convent
at
the
end
of
three
hours
and
a
half
our
march
during
the
whole
of
this
journey
had
been
slow
except
on
the
day
of
our
flight
from
the
robbers
for
our
camels
were
weak
and
tired
and
one
of
us
usually
walked
there
is
a
more
northern
road
from
sherm
to
the
convent
which
branches
off
from
that
by
which
we
came
at
wady
orta
it
passes
by
the
two
watering
places
of
naszeb
arabic
and
yne
arabic
the
former
which
is
in
a
fruitful
valley
where
trees
grow
must
not
be
confounded
with
the
western
naszeb
already
mentioned
hamd
afraid
of
being
liable
to
pay
the
fine
of
blood
if
it
should
become
known
that
the
robber
had
fallen
by
his
hand
had
convent
of
mount
sinai
made
us
all
give
him
our
solemn
promise
not
to
mention
any
thing
of
the
affair
when
i
discharged
him
and
ayd
at
the
convent
i
made
them
both
some
presents
which
they
had
well
deserved
particularly
hamd
this
he
was
so
imprudent
as
to
mention
to
his
uncle
szaleh
who
was
so
vexed
at
not
receiving
a
present
that
he
immediately
divulged
all
the
circumstances
of
our
rencounter
hamd
in
consequence
was
under
the
greatest
apprehensions
from
the
relations
of
the
robber
and
having
accompanied
me
on
my
return
to
cairo
he
remained
with
me
some
time
there
in
anxious
expectation
of
hearing
whether
the
blood
was
likely
to
be
revenged
not
hearing
any
thing
he
then
returned
to
his
mountain
four
months
after
which
a
party
of
omran
to
whose
tribe
the
men
had
belonged
came
to
the
tent
of
the
sheikh
of
the
towara
to
demand
the
fine
of
blood
the
man
had
died
a
few
days
after
receiving
the
wound
and
although
he
was
a
robber
and
the
first
aggressor
the
bedouin
laws
entitled
his
relations
to
the
fine
if
they
waved
the
right
of
retaliation
hamd
was
therefore
glad
to
come
to
a
compromise
and
paid
them
two
camels
which
the
two
principal
sheikhs
of
the
towara
gave
him
for
the
purpose
and
twenty
dollars
which
i
thought
myself
bound
to
reimburse
to
him
when
he
afterwards
called
on
me
at
cairo
this
was
the
third
man
hamd
had
killed
in
skirmish
but
he
had
paid
no
fine
for
the
others
as
it
was
never
known
who
they
were
nor
to
what
tribe
they
belonged
had
hamd
whom
every
one
knew
to
be
the
person
who
had
stabbed
the
robber
refused
to
pay
the
fine
the
omran
would
sooner
or
later
have
retaliated
upon
himself
or
his
relations
or
perhaps
upon
some
other
individual
of
his
tribe
according
to
the
custom
of
these
bedouins
who
have
established
among
themselves
the
law
of
see
my
remarks
on
the
customs
of
in
the
description
of
bedouin
manners
the
convent
of
mount
sinai
is
situated
in
a
valley
so
narrow
that
one
part
of
the
building
stands
on
the
side
of
the
western
mountain
while
a
space
of
twenty
paces
only
is
left
between
its
walls
and
the
eastern
mountain
the
valley
is
open
to
the
north
from
whence
approaches
the
road
from
cairo
to
the
south
close
behind
the
convent
it
is
shut
up
by
a
third
mountain
less
steep
than
the
others
over
which
passes
the
road
to
sherm
the
convent
is
an
irregular
quadrangle
of
about
one
hundred
and
thirty
paces
enclosed
by
high
and
solid
walls
built
with
blocks
of
granite
and
fortified
by
several
small
towers
while
the
french
were
in
egypt
a
part
of
the
east
wall
which
had
fallen
down
was
completely
rebuilt
by
order
of
general
kleber
who
sent
workmen
here
for
that
purpose
the
upper
part
of
the
walls
in
the
interior
is
built
of
a
mixture
of
and
gravel
cemented
together
by
mud
which
has
acquired
great
hardness
the
convent
contains
eight
or
ten
small
some
of
which
are
neatly
laid
out
in
beds
of
flowers
and
vegetables
a
few
and
cypresses
also
grow
there
and
great
numbers
of
vines
the
distribution
of
the
interior
is
very
irregular
and
could
not
be
otherwise
considering
the
slope
upon
which
the
building
stands
but
the
whole
is
very
clean
and
neat
there
are
a
great
number
of
small
rooms
in
the
lower
and
upper
stories
most
of
which
are
at
present
unoccupied
the
principal
building
in
the
interior
is
the
great
church
which
as
well
as
the
convent
was
built
by
the
emperor
justinian
but
it
has
subsequently
undergone
frequent
repairs
the
form
of
the
church
is
an
oblong
square
the
roof
is
supported
by
a
double
row
of
fine
granite
pillars
which
have
been
covered
with
a
coat
of
white
plaster
perhaps
because
the
natural
colour
of
the
stone
was
not
agreeeble
to
the
monks
who
saw
granite
on
every
side
of
them
the
capitals
of
the
columns
are
of
different
designs
several
of
them
bear
a
resemblance
to
palm
branches
while
others
are
a
close
but
coarse
imitation
of
the
latest
period
of
egyptian
sculpture
such
as
is
seen
at
philae
and
in
several
temples
in
nubia
the
dome
over
the
altar
still
remains
as
it
was
constructed
by
justinian
whose
portrait
together
with
that
of
his
wife
theodora
may
yet
be
distinguished
on
the
dome
together
with
a
large
picture
of
the
transfiguration
in
honour
of
which
event
the
convent
was
erected
an
abundance
of
silver
lamps
paintings
and
portraits
of
saints
adorn
the
walls
round
the
altar
among
the
latter
is
a
saint
christopher
with
a
head
the
floor
of
the
church
is
finely
paved
with
slabs
of
marble
the
church
contains
the
coffin
in
which
the
bones
of
saint
catherine
were
collected
from
the
neighbouring
mountain
of
catherine
where
her
corpse
was
transported
after
her
death
by
the
angels
in
the
service
of
the
monks
the
silver
lid
of
a
sarcophagus
likewise
attracts
attention
upon
it
is
represented
at
full
length
the
figure
of
the
empress
anne
of
russia
who
entertained
the
idea
of
being
interred
in
the
sarcophagus
which
she
sent
here
but
the
monks
were
disappointed
of
this
honour
in
a
small
chapel
adjoining
the
church
is
shewn
the
place
where
the
lord
is
supposed
to
have
appeared
to
moses
in
the
burning
bush
it
is
called
alyka
arabic
and
is
considered
as
the
most
holy
spot
in
mount
sinai
besides
the
great
church
there
are
smaller
churches
or
chapels
dispersed
over
the
convent
in
many
of
which
daily
masses
are
read
and
in
all
of
them
at
least
one
every
sunday
the
convent
formerly
resembled
in
its
establishment
that
of
the
holy
sepulchre
at
jerusalem
which
contains
churches
of
various
sects
of
christians
every
principal
sect
except
the
calvinists
and
protestants
had
its
churches
in
the
convent
of
sinai
i
was
shewn
the
chapels
belonging
to
the
syrians
armenians
copts
and
latins
but
they
have
long
been
abandoned
by
their
owners
the
church
of
the
latins
fell
into
ruins
at
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
has
not
been
rebuilt
but
what
is
more
remarkable
than
the
existence
of
so
many
churches
is
that
close
by
the
great
church
stands
a
mahometan
mosque
spacious
enough
to
contain
two
hundred
people
at
prayers
the
monks
told
me
that
it
was
built
in
the
sixteenth
century
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
the
convent
their
tradition
is
as
follows
when
selim
the
othman
emperor
conquered
egypt
he
took
a
great
fancy
to
a
young
greek
priest
who
falling
ill
at
the
time
that
selim
was
returning
to
constantinople
was
sent
by
him
to
this
convent
to
recover
his
health
the
young
man
died
upon
which
the
emperor
enraged
at
what
he
considered
to
be
the
work
of
the
priests
gave
orders
to
the
governor
of
egypt
to
destroy
all
the
christian
establishments
in
the
peninsula
of
which
there
were
several
at
that
period
the
priests
of
the
great
convent
of
mount
sinai
being
informed
of
the
preparations
making
in
egypt
to
carry
these
orders
into
execution
began
immediately
to
build
a
mosque
within
their
walls
hoping
that
for
its
sake
their
house
would
be
spared
it
is
said
that
their
project
was
successful
and
that
ever
since
the
mosque
has
been
kept
in
repair
this
tradition
however
is
contradicted
by
some
old
arabic
records
kept
by
the
prior
in
which
i
read
a
circumstantial
account
how
in
the
year
of
the
hedjra
some
straggling
turkish
hadjis
who
had
been
cut
off
from
the
caravan
were
brought
by
the
bedouins
to
the
convent
and
being
found
to
be
well
educated
and
originally
from
upper
egypt
were
retained
here
and
a
salary
settled
on
them
and
their
descendants
on
condition
of
their
becoming
the
servants
of
the
mosque
the
conquest
of
egypt
by
selim
did
not
take
place
till
the
mosque
in
the
convent
of
sinai
appears
therefore
to
have
existed
long
before
the
time
of
selim
the
descendants
of
these
hadjis
now
poor
bedouins
are
called
retheny
arabic
they
still
continue
to
be
the
servants
of
the
mosque
which
they
clean
on
thursday
evenings
and
light
the
lamps
one
of
them
is
called
the
imam
the
mosque
is
sometimes
visited
by
moslim
pilgrims
but
it
is
only
upon
the
occasion
of
the
presence
of
some
mussulman
of
consequence
that
the
call
to
prayers
is
made
from
the
minaret
in
the
convent
are
two
deep
and
copious
wells
of
spring
water
one
of
them
is
called
the
well
of
moses
because
it
is
said
that
he
first
drank
of
its
water
another
was
the
work
as
the
monks
say
of
an
english
lord
it
bears
the
date
there
is
also
a
reservoir
for
the
reception
of
rain
water
none
of
the
churches
or
chapels
have
steeples
there
is
a
bell
which
i
believe
is
rung
only
on
sundays
the
usual
mode
of
calling
the
monks
to
morning
prayers
is
by
striking
with
a
stick
upon
a
long
piece
of
granite
suspended
from
ropes
which
produces
a
sound
heard
all
over
the
convent
close
by
it
hangs
a
piece
of
dry
wood
which
emits
a
different
sound
and
summons
to
vespers
a
small
tower
is
shewn
which
was
built
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
for
the
residence
of
a
greek
patriarch
of
constantinople
who
was
exiled
to
this
place
by
the
orders
of
the
sultan
and
who
remained
here
till
he
died
according
to
the
credited
tradition
the
origin
of
the
convent
of
mount
sinai
dates
from
the
fourth
century
helena
the
mother
of
constantine
is
said
to
have
erected
here
a
small
church
in
commemoration
of
the
place
where
the
lord
appeared
to
moses
in
the
burning
bush
and
in
the
garden
of
the
convent
a
small
tower
is
still
shewn
the
foundations
of
which
are
said
to
have
been
laid
by
her
the
church
of
helena
drawing
many
visitors
and
monks
to
these
mountains
several
small
convents
were
erected
in
different
parts
of
the
peninsula
in
the
course
of
the
next
century
but
the
ill
treatment
which
the
monks
and
hermits
suffered
from
the
bedouins
induced
them
at
last
to
present
a
petition
to
the
emperor
justinian
entreating
him
to
build
a
fortified
convent
capable
of
affording
them
protection
against
their
oppressors
he
granted
the
request
and
sent
workmen
from
constantinople
and
egypt
with
orders
to
erect
a
large
convent
upon
the
top
of
the
mountain
of
moses
those
however
to
whom
the
work
was
entrusted
observing
the
entire
want
of
water
in
that
spot
built
it
on
the
present
site
they
attempted
in
vain
to
cut
away
the
mountain
on
each
side
of
the
building
with
a
view
to
prevent
the
arabs
from
taking
post
there
and
throwing
stones
at
the
monks
within
the
building
being
completed
justinian
sent
from
constantinople
some
slaves
natives
of
the
shores
of
the
black
sea
to
officiate
as
servants
in
the
convent
who
established
themselves
with
their
families
in
the
neighbouring
valleys
the
first
prior
was
doulas
whose
name
is
still
recorded
upon
a
stone
built
into
the
wall
of
one
of
the
buildings
in
the
interior
of
the
convent
the
above
history
is
taken
from
a
document
in
arabic
preserved
by
the
monks
an
arabic
inscription
over
the
gate
in
modern
characters
says
that
justinian
built
the
convent
in
the
thirtieth
year
of
his
reign
as
a
memorial
of
himself
and
his
wife
theodora
it
is
curious
to
find
a
passage
of
the
koran
introduced
into
this
inscription
it
was
probably
done
by
a
moslem
sculptor
without
the
knowledge
of
the
monks
a
few
years
after
the
completion
of
the
convent
one
of
the
monks
is
said
to
have
been
informed
in
his
sleep
that
the
corpse
of
catherine
who
suffered
martyrdom
at
alexandria
had
been
transported
by
angels
to
the
summit
of
the
highest
peak
of
the
surrounding
mountains
the
monks
ascended
the
mountain
in
procession
found
the
bones
and
deposited
them
in
their
church
which
thus
acquired
an
additional
claim
to
the
veneration
of
the
greeks
monastic
establishments
seem
soon
after
to
have
considerably
increased
throughout
the
peninsula
small
convents
chapels
and
hermitages
the
remains
of
many
of
which
are
still
visible
were
built
in
various
parts
of
it
the
prior
told
me
that
justinian
gave
the
whole
peninsula
in
property
to
the
convent
and
that
at
the
time
of
the
mohammedan
conquest
six
or
seven
thousand
monks
and
hermits
were
dispersed
over
the
mountains
the
establishments
of
the
peninsula
of
sinai
thus
resembling
those
which
still
exist
on
the
peninsula
of
mount
athos
it
is
a
favourite
belief
of
the
monks
of
mount
sinai
that
mohammed
himself
in
one
of
his
journeys
alighted
under
the
walls
of
the
convent
and
that
impressed
with
due
veneration
for
the
mountain
of
moses
he
presented
to
the
convent
a
firmahn
to
secure
to
it
the
respect
of
all
his
followers
ali
is
said
to
have
written
it
and
mohammed
who
could
not
write
to
have
confirmed
it
by
impressing
his
extended
hand
blackened
with
ink
upon
the
parchment
this
firmahn
it
is
added
remained
in
the
convent
until
selim
the
first
conquered
egypt
when
hearing
of
the
precious
relic
he
sent
for
it
and
added
it
to
the
other
relics
of
mohammed
in
the
imperial
treasury
at
constantinople
giving
to
the
convent
in
return
a
copy
of
the
original
certified
with
his
own
cipher
i
have
seen
the
latter
which
is
kept
in
the
sinai
convent
at
cairo
but
i
do
not
believe
it
to
be
an
authentic
document
none
of
the
historians
of
mohammed
who
have
recorded
the
transactions
of
almost
every
day
of
his
life
mention
his
having
been
at
mount
sinai
neither
in
his
earlier
youth
nor
after
he
set
up
as
a
prophet
and
it
is
totally
contrary
to
history
that
he
should
have
granted
to
any
christians
such
privileges
as
are
mentioned
in
this
firmahn
one
of
which
is
that
the
moslems
are
bound
to
aid
the
christian
monks
in
rebuilding
their
ruined
churches
it
is
to
be
observed
also
that
this
document
states
itself
to
have
been
written
by
ali
not
at
the
convent
but
in
the
mosque
of
the
prophet
at
medina
in
the
second
year
of
the
hedjra
and
is
addressed
not
to
the
convent
of
mount
sinai
in
particular
but
to
all
the
christians
and
their
priests
the
names
of
witnesses
followers
of
mohammed
are
subscribed
to
it
and
in
a
note
it
is
expressly
stated
that
the
original
written
by
ali
was
lost
and
that
the
present
was
copied
from
a
fourth
successive
copy
taken
from
the
original
hence
it
appears
that
the
relation
of
the
priests
is
at
variance
with
the
document
to
which
they
refer
and
i
have
little
doubt
therefore
that
the
former
is
a
fable
and
the
latter
a
forgery
notwithstanding
the
difficulties
to
which
the
monks
must
have
been
exposed
from
the
warlike
and
fanatical
followers
of
the
new
faith
in
syria
arabia
egypt
and
the
desert
the
convent
continued
uninjured
and
defended
itself
successfully
against
all
the
surrounding
tribes
by
the
peculiar
arms
of
its
possessors
patience
meekness
and
money
according
to
the
statement
of
the
monks
their
predecessors
were
made
responsible
by
the
sultans
of
egypt
for
the
protection
of
the
pilgrim
caravans
from
cairo
to
mekka
on
that
part
of
the
road
which
lay
along
the
northern
frontiers
of
their
territory
from
suez
to
akaba
for
this
purpose
they
thought
it
necessary
to
invite
several
tribes
and
particularly
the
szowaleha
and
the
aleygat
to
settle
in
the
fertile
valleys
of
sinai
in
order
to
serve
as
protectors
of
this
road
the
bedouins
came
but
their
power
increasing
while
that
of
the
monks
declined
they
in
the
course
of
time
took
possession
of
the
whole
peninsula
and
confined
the
monks
to
their
convent
it
appears
from
the
original
copy
of
a
compact
between
the
monks
and
the
above
bedouins
made
in
the
year
of
the
hedjra
when
sultan
dhaher
bybars
reigned
in
egypt
that
besides
this
convent
six
others
were
still
existing
in
the
peninsula
exclusive
of
a
number
of
chapels
and
hermitages
from
a
writing
on
parchment
dated
in
the
we
find
that
in
that
year
all
these
minor
establishments
had
been
abandoned
and
that
the
great
convent
holding
property
at
feiran
tor
and
in
other
fruitful
valleys
alone
remained
the
priests
assured
me
that
they
had
documents
to
prove
that
all
the
date
valleys
and
other
fertile
spots
in
the
gulf
of
akaba
had
been
in
their
possession
and
were
confirmed
to
them
by
the
sultans
of
egypt
but
they
either
could
not
or
would
not
shew
me
their
archives
in
detail
without
an
order
from
the
prior
at
cairo
indeed
all
their
papers
appeared
to
be
in
great
confusion
whenever
a
new
sultan
ascends
the
throne
of
constantinople
the
convent
is
furnished
with
a
new
firmahn
which
is
transmitted
to
the
pasha
of
egypt
but
as
the
neighbouring
bedouins
till
within
a
few
years
were
completely
independent
of
egypt
the
protection
of
the
pashas
was
of
very
little
use
to
the
monks
and
their
only
dependance
was
upon
their
own
resources
and
their
means
of
purchasing
and
conciliating
the
friendship
or
of
appeasing
the
animosity
of
the
arabs
at
present
there
are
only
monks
in
the
convent
they
are
under
the
presidence
of
a
wakyl
or
prior
but
the
ikonómos
greek
whom
the
arabs
call
the
kolob
is
the
true
head
of
the
community
and
manages
all
its
affairs
the
order
of
sinai
monks
dispersed
over
the
east
is
under
the
control
of
an
archbishop
in
arabic
called
the
reys
he
is
chosen
by
a
council
of
delegates
from
mount
sinai
and
from
the
affiliated
convent
at
cairo
and
he
is
confirmed
pro
forma
by
the
greek
patriarch
of
jerusalem
the
archbishop
can
do
nothing
as
to
the
appropriation
of
the
funds
without
the
unanimous
vote
of
the
council
formerly
he
lived
in
the
convent
but
since
its
affairs
have
been
on
the
decline
it
has
been
found
more
expedient
that
he
should
reside
abroad
his
presence
here
entitling
the
bedouins
to
great
fees
particularly
on
his
entrance
into
the
convent
i
was
told
that
ten
thousand
dollars
would
be
required
on
such
an
occasion
to
fulfil
all
the
obligations
to
which
the
community
is
bound
in
its
treaties
with
the
arabs
hence
it
happens
that
no
archbishop
has
been
here
since
the
year
when
the
reys
kyrillos
resided
and
i
believe
died
in
the
convent
i
was
informed
that
the
gate
has
remained
walled
up
since
the
year
but
that
if
an
archbishop
were
to
come
it
must
be
again
opened
to
admit
him
and
that
all
the
bedouin
sheiks
then
have
a
right
to
enter
within
the
walls
besides
the
convent
at
cairo
which
contains
a
prior
and
about
fifty
monks
mount
sinai
has
establishments
and
landed
property
in
many
other
parts
of
the
east
especially
in
the
archipelago
and
at
candia
it
has
also
a
small
church
at
calcutta
and
another
at
surat
the
discipline
of
these
monks
with
regard
to
food
and
prayer
is
very
severe
they
are
obliged
to
attend
mass
twice
in
the
day
and
twice
in
the
night
the
rule
is
that
they
shall
taste
no
flesh
whatever
all
the
year
round
and
in
their
great
fast
they
not
only
abstain
from
butter
and
every
kind
of
animal
food
and
fish
but
also
from
oil
and
live
four
days
in
the
week
on
bread
and
boiled
vegetables
of
which
one
small
dish
is
all
their
dinner
they
obtain
their
vegetables
from
a
pleasant
garden
adjoining
the
building
into
which
there
is
a
subterraneous
passage
the
soil
is
stony
but
in
this
climate
wherever
water
is
in
plenty
the
very
rocks
will
produce
vegetation
the
fruit
is
of
the
finest
quality
oranges
lemons
almonds
mulberries
apricots
peaches
pears
apples
olives
nebek
trees
and
a
few
cypresses
overshade
the
beds
in
which
melons
beans
lettuces
onions
cucumbers
and
all
sorts
of
culinary
and
herbs
are
sown
the
garden
however
is
very
seldom
visited
by
the
monks
except
by
the
few
whose
business
it
is
to
keep
it
in
order
for
although
surrounded
by
high
walls
it
is
not
inaccessible
to
the
bedouins
who
for
the
three
last
years
have
been
the
sole
gatherers
of
the
fruits
leaving
the
vegetables
only
for
the
monks
who
have
thus
been
obliged
to
repurchase
their
own
fruit
from
the
pilferers
or
to
buy
it
in
other
parts
of
the
peninsula
the
excellent
air
of
the
convent
and
the
simple
fare
of
the
inhabitants
render
diseases
rare
many
of
the
monks
are
very
old
men
in
the
full
possession
of
their
mental
and
bodily
faculties
they
have
all
taken
to
some
profession
a
mode
of
rendering
themselves
independent
of
egypt
which
was
practised
here
even
when
the
three
hundred
private
chambers
were
occupied
which
are
now
empty
though
still
ready
for
the
accommodation
of
pious
settlers
among
the
monks
who
now
remain
there
is
a
cook
a
distiller
a
baker
a
shoemaker
a
tailor
a
carpenter
a
smith
a
mason
a
gardener
a
maker
of
candles
each
of
these
has
his
in
the
and
rusty
utensils
of
which
are
still
to
be
seen
the
traces
of
the
former
riches
and
industry
of
the
establishment
the
rooms
in
which
the
provisions
are
kept
are
vaulted
and
built
of
granite
with
great
solidity
each
kind
of
provision
has
its
purveyor
the
and
distillery
are
still
kept
up
upon
a
large
scale
the
best
bread
is
of
the
finest
quality
but
a
second
and
third
sort
is
made
for
the
bedouins
who
are
fed
by
the
convent
in
the
distillery
they
make
brandy
from
dates
which
is
the
only
solace
these
recluses
enjoy
and
in
this
they
are
permitted
to
indulge
even
during
the
fasts
most
of
the
monks
are
natives
of
the
greek
islands
in
general
they
do
not
remain
more
than
four
or
five
years
when
they
return
to
their
own
country
proud
of
having
been
sufferers
among
bedouins
some
however
have
been
here
forty
years
a
few
of
them
only
understood
arabic
but
none
of
them
write
or
read
it
being
of
the
lower
orders
of
society
and
educated
only
in
convents
they
are
extremely
ignorant
few
of
them
read
even
the
modern
greek
fluently
excepting
in
their
and
i
found
but
one
who
had
any
notion
of
the
ancient
greek
they
have
a
good
library
but
it
is
always
shut
up
it
contains
about
fifteen
hundred
greek
volumes
and
seven
hundred
arabic
manuscripts
the
latter
which
i
examined
volume
after
volume
consist
entirely
of
books
of
prayer
copies
of
the
gospels
lives
of
saints
liturgies
a
thick
folio
volume
of
the
works
of
lokman
edited
according
to
the
arab
tradition
by
hormus
the
ancient
king
of
egypt
was
the
only
one
worth
attention
its
title
in
arabic
is
arabic
the
prior
would
not
permit
it
to
be
taken
away
but
he
made
me
a
present
of
a
fine
copy
of
the
aldine
odyssey
and
an
equally
fine
one
of
the
anthology
in
the
room
anciently
the
residence
of
the
archbishop
which
is
very
elegantly
paved
with
marble
and
extremely
well
furnished
though
at
present
unoccupied
is
preserved
a
beautiful
ancient
manuscript
of
the
gospels
in
greek
which
i
was
told
was
given
to
the
convent
by
emperor
called
it
is
written
in
letters
of
gold
upon
vellum
and
ornamented
with
portraits
of
the
apostles
notwithstanding
the
ignorance
of
these
monks
they
are
fond
of
seeing
strangers
in
their
wilderness
and
i
met
with
a
more
cordial
reception
among
them
than
i
did
in
the
convents
of
libanus
which
are
in
possession
of
all
the
luxuries
of
life
the
monks
of
sinai
are
even
generous
three
years
ago
they
furnished
a
servian
adventurer
who
styled
himself
a
knes
and
pretended
to
be
well
known
to
the
russian
government
with
sixty
dollars
to
pay
his
journey
back
to
alexandria
on
his
informing
them
of
his
destitute
circumstances
at
present
the
convent
is
seldom
visited
a
few
greeks
from
cairo
and
suez
and
the
inhabitants
of
tor
who
repair
here
every
summer
and
encamp
with
their
families
in
the
garden
are
the
only
persons
who
venture
to
undertake
the
journey
through
the
desert
so
late
as
the
last
century
regular
caravans
of
pilgrims
used
to
come
here
from
cairo
as
well
as
from
jerusalem
a
document
preserved
by
the
monks
states
the
arrival
in
one
day
of
eight
hundred
armenians
from
jerusalem
and
at
another
time
of
five
hundred
copts
from
cairo
i
believe
that
from
sixty
to
eighty
is
the
greatest
number
of
visitors
that
can
now
be
reckoned
in
a
year
in
the
small
but
neat
room
which
i
occupied
and
which
is
assigned
to
all
strangers
whom
the
prior
receives
with
any
marks
of
distinction
were
the
names
of
some
of
the
latest
european
travellers
who
have
visited
the
convent
the
following
inscriptions
written
upon
pieces
of
paper
stuck
against
the
walls
i
thought
worth

of

has
fallen
into
a
mistake
in
calling
the
convent
by
the
name
of
saint
catherine
it
is
dedicated
to
the
transfiguration
or
as
the
greeks
call
it
the
metamorphosis
and
not
to
saint
catherine
whose
relics
only
are
preserved
here
seetzen
visited
the
convent
a
second
time
previous
to
his
going
to
arabia
he
came
then
from
tor
and
stopped
only
one
day
the
visit
of
two
english
travellers
galley
knight
and
fazakerly
is
also
recorded
in
a
few
lines
dated
february
the
same
room
contained
likewise
several
modern
arabic
inscriptions
one
of
which
says
this
holy
place
came
one
who
does
not
deserve
that
his
name
should
be
mentioned
so
manifold
are
his
sins
he
came
here
with
his
family
may
whoever
reads
this
beseech
the
almighty
to
forgive
him
june
the
only
habitual
visitors
of
the
convent
are
the
bedouins
they
have
established
the
custom
that
whoever
amongst
them
whether
man
woman
or
child
comes
here
is
to
receive
bread
for
breakfast
and
supper
which
is
lowered
down
to
them
from
the
window
as
no
bedouins
except
the
servants
of
the
house
are
ever
admitted
within
the
walls
fortunately
for
the
monks
there
are
no
good
pasturing
places
in
their
immediate
neighbourhood
the
arab
encampments
are
therefore
always
at
some
distance
and
visitors
are
thus
not
so
frequent
as
might
be
supposed
yet
scarcely
a
day
passes
without
their
having
to
furnish
bread
to
thirty
or
forty
persons
in
the
last
century
the
bedouins
enjoyed
still
greater
privileges
and
had
a
right
to
call
for
a
dish
of
cooked
meat
at
breakfast
and
for
another
at
supper
the
monks
could
not
have
given
a
stronger
proof
of
their
address
than
by
obtaining
the
abandonment
of
this
right
from
men
in
whose
power
they
are
so
completely
placed
the
convent
of
sinai
at
cairo
is
subject
to
similar
claims
all
the
bedouins
of
the
peninsula
who
repair
to
that
city
on
their
private
business
receive
their
daily
meal
from
the
monks
who
not
having
the
same
excuses
as
their
brethren
of
mount
sinai
are
obliged
to
supply
a
dish
of
cooked
meat
the
convent
has
its
ghafeirs
or
protectors
in
number
among
the
tribes
inhabiting
the
desert
between
syria
and
the
red
sea
but
the
more
remote
of
them
are
entitled
only
to
some
annual
presents
in
clothes
and
money
while
the
towara
ghafeirs
are
continually
hovering
round
the
walls
to
extort
as
much
as
they
can
of
the
towara
arabs
the
tribes
of
szowaleha
and
aleygat
only
are
considered
as
protectors
the
mezeine
who
came
in
later
times
to
the
peninsula
have
no
claims
and
of
the
szowaleha
tribe
the
branches
oulad
said
and
owareme
are
exclusively
the
protectors
while
the
koreysh
and
rahamy
are
not
only
excluded
from
the
right
of
protection
but
also
from
the
transport
of
passengers
and
loads
of
the
oulad
said
each
individual
receives
an
annual
gift
of
a
dollar
and
the
ghafeir
of
this
branch
of
the
szowaleha
is
the
chief
man
of
business
in
the
desert
if
a
sheikh
or
head
man
calls
at
the
convent
he
receives
in
addition
to
his
bread
some
coffee
beans
sugar
soap
sometimes
a
handkerchief
a
little
medicine
under
such
circumstances
it
may
easily
be
conceived
that
disputes
continually
happen
if
a
sheikh
from
the
protecting
tribes
comes
to
the
convent
to
demand
coffee
sugar
or
clothing
and
is
not
well
satisfied
with
what
he
receives
he
immediately
becomes
the
enemy
of
the
monks
lays
waste
some
of
their
gardens
and
must
at
last
be
gained
over
by
a
present
the
independent
state
of
the
bedouins
of
sinai
had
long
prevented
the
monks
from
endeavouring
to
obtain
protection
from
the
government
of
egypt
whose
power
in
the
peninsula
being
trifling
they
would
only
by
complaining
have
exasperated
the
bedouins
against
them
their
differences
therefore
had
hitherto
been
accommodated
by
the
mediation
of
other
sheikhs
it
was
not
till
that
they
solicited
the
protection
of
mohammed
ali
this
will
secure
them
for
the
present
against
their
neighbours
but
it
will
probably
as
i
told
the
monks
be
detrimental
to
them
in
the
end
ten
or
twenty
dollars
were
sufficient
to
pacify
the
fiercest
bedouin
but
a
turkish
governor
will
demand
a
thousand
for
any
effectual
protection
the
arabs
when
discontented
have
sometimes
seized
a
monk
in
the
mountains
and
given
him
a
severe
beating
or
have
thrown
stones
or
fired
their
musquets
into
the
convent
from
the
neighbouring
heights
about
twenty
years
ago
a
monk
was
killed
by
them
the
monks
in
their
turn
have
fired
occasionally
upon
the
bedouins
for
they
have
a
well
furnished
armory
and
two
small
cannon
but
they
take
great
care
never
to
kill
any
one
and
though
they
dislike
such
turbulent
neighbours
and
describe
them
to
strangers
as
very
devils
yet
they
have
sense
enough
to
perceive
the
advantages
which
they
derive
from
the
better
traits
in
the
bedouin
character
such
as
their
general
good
faith
and
their
placability
our
convent
as
they
have
observed
to
me
been
subject
to
the
revolutions
and
oppressions
of
egypt
or
syria
it
would
long
ago
have
been
abandoned
but
providence
has
preserved
us
by
giving
us
bedouins
for
notwithstanding
the
greediness
of
the
bedouins
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
expenses
of
the
convent
are
very
moderate
each
monk
is
supplied
annually
with
two
coarse
woollen
cloaks
and
no
splendour
is
any
where
displayed
except
in
the
furniture
of
the
great
church
and
that
of
the
room
the
supplies
are
drawn
from
egypt
but
the
communication
by
caravans
with
cairo
is
far
from
being
regular
and
the
ikonómos
assured
me
that
at
the
time
i
was
there
the
house
did
not
contain
more
than
one
provision
the
yearly
consumption
of
corn
is
about
one
hundred
and
sixty
erdebs
or
two
thousand
five
hundred
bushels
which
is
sufficient
to
cover
all
the
demands
of
the
bedouins
and
i
believe
that
sterling
or
dollars
is
the
utmost
of
the
annual
expenditure
the
convent
at
cairo
expends
perhaps
two
or
three
times
that
sum
the
monks
complain
greatly
of
poverty
and
the
prior
assured
me
that
he
sometimes
has
not
a
farthing
left
to
pay
for
the
corn
that
is
brought
to
him
and
is
obliged
to
borrow
money
from
the
bedouins
at
high
interest
but
an
appearance
of
poverty
is
one
of
their
great
protections
and
considering
the
possessions
of
this
convent
abroad
and
the
presents
which
it
receives
from
pilgrims
i
am
much
inclined
to
doubt
the
assertion
the
bedouins
who
occupy
the
peninsula
of
mount
sinai
are
i
the
szowaleha
arabic
they
are
the
principal
tribe

they
boast
of
having
been
the
first
bedouins

settled
in
these
mountains

their
founder

two
of
whose
sons

say
emigrated

into
several
branches

oulad
said

whose
sheikh
is
at
present
the
second
sheikh
of
the
towara
arabs
they
are
not
so
poor
as
the
other
tribes
and
possess
the
best
valleys
of
the
mountains

sheikh
szaleh

is

sheikh
of

business
with

the

about
fifteen

who
live
with

are
usually
found
in

neighbourhood
of

they
are
said
to
have
come
originally
from
barbary
some
of
their
brethren
are
also
settled
in
upper
egypt
these
five
tribes
are
comprised
under
the
appellation
towara
or
the
bedouins
of
tor
and
form
a
single
body
whenever
any
foreign
tribe
of
the
northern
bedouins
attacks
any
one
of
them
but
sometimes
though
not
often
they
have
bloody
quarrels
among
themselves
their
history
according
to
the
reports
of
the
best
informed
among
them
founded
upon
tradition
is
as
follows
at
the
period
of
the
mohammedan
conquest
or
soon
after
the
peninsula
of
mount
sinai
was
inhabited
exclusively
by
the
tribe
of
oulad
soleiman
or
beni
selman
together
with
the
monks
the
szowaleha
and
aleygat
the
latter
originally
from
the
eastern
syrian
desert
were
then
living
on
the
borders
of
egypt
and
in
the
sherkieh
or
eastern
district
of
the
delta
from
whence
they
were
accustomed
to
make
frequent
inroads
into
this
territory
in
order
to
carry
off
the
and
other
fruits
some
encampments
of
szowaleha
are
still
found
in
the
sherkieh
whenever
the
inundation
of
the
nile
failed
they
repaired
in
great
numbers
to
these
mountains
and
pastured
their
herds
in
the
fertile
valleys
the
vegetation
of
which
is
much
more
nutritious
for
camels
and
sheep
than
the
luxuriant
but
insipid
pastures
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
after
long
wars
the
szowaleha
and
aleygat
succeeded
in
reducing
the
oulad
soleiman
many
of
their
families
were
exterminated
others
fled
and
their
feeble
remains
now
live
near
tor
where
they
still
pride
themselves
upon
having
been
the
former
lords
of
this
peninsula
the
szowaleha
and
aleygat
however
did
not
agree
and
had
frequent
disputes
among
themselves
at
that
period
there
arrived
at
sherm
four
families
of
the
mezeine
a
very
potent
tribe
in
the
hedjaz
east
of
medina
where
they
are
still
found
in
large
numbers
forming
part
of
the
great
tribe
of
beni
harb
they
were
flying
from
the
effects
of
and
wishing
to
settle
here
they
applied
to
the
szowaleha
begging
to
be
permitted
to
join
them
in
their
pastures
the
szowaleha
consented
on
condition
of
their
paying
a
yearly
tribute
in
sheep
in
the
same
manner
as
the
despised
tribe
of
heteym
on
the
opposite
coast
of
the
gulf
of
akaba
does
to
all
the
surrounding
arabs
arabic
the
high
spirited
mezeine
however
rejected
the
offer
as
derogatory
to
their
free
born
condition
and
addressed
themselves
to
the
aleygat
who
readily
admitted
them
to
their
brotherhood
and
all
their
pastures
long
and
obstinate
wars
between
the
szowaleha
and
aleygat
were
the
consequence
of
this
compact
the
two
tribes
fought
it
is
said
for
forty
years
and
in
the
greatest
and
the
last
battle
which
took
place
in
wady
barak
the
mezeine
decided
the
contest
in
favour
of
the
aleygat
great
says
the
bedouin
tradition
the
number
of
the
szowaleha
killed
in
this
engagement
that
the
nails
of
the
slain
were
seen
for
many
years
after
the
sport
of
the
winds
in
the
valleys
around
the
field
of
no
nation
equals
the
bedouins
in
numerical
exaggeration
ask
a
bedouin
who
belongs
to
a
tribe
of
three
hundred
tents
of
the
numbers
of
his
brethren
and
he
will
take
a
handful
of
sand
and
cast
it
up
in
the
air
or
point
to
the
stars
and
tell
you
that
they
are
as
numberless
much
is
therefore
necessary
even
to
arrive
at
an
approximation
to
the
truth
a
compromise
now
took
place
the
szowaleha
and
aleygat
divided
the
fertile
valleys
of
the
country
equally
and
the
mezeine
received
of
their
share
from
the
latter
the
sheikh
of
the
szowaleha
was
at
the
same
time
acknowledged
as
sheikh
of
the
whole
peninsula
at
present
the
mezeine
are
stronger
than
the
aleygat
and
both
together
are
about
equal
in
number
to
the
szowaleha
besides
the
towara
tribes
three
others
inhabit
the
northern
parts
of
the
peninsula
viz
the
heywat
arabic
who
live
towards
akaba
the
tyaha
arabic
who
extend
from
the
chain
of
the
mountain
el
tyh
northwards
towards
ghaza
and
hebron
and
the
terabein
arabic
who
occupy
the
part
of
the
peninsula
and
extend
from
thence
towards
ghaza
and
hebron
these
three
tribes
are
together
stronger
than
the
towara
with
whom
they
are
sometimes
at
war
and
being
all
derived
from
one
common
stock
the
ancient
tribe
of
beni
attye
they
are
always
firmly
united
during
hostilities
they
have
no
right
to
the
pasturages
south
of
djebel
tyh
but
are
permitted
to
encamp
sometimes
in
that
direction
if
pasture
is
abundant
the
pastures
in
their
own
territory
along
the
whole
of
the
northern
parts
of
djebel
tyh
are
said
to
be
excellent
and
to
extend
from
one
side
of
the
peninsula
to
the
other
i
believe
that
the
population
of
the
entire
peninsula
south
of
a
line
from
akaba
to
suez
as
far
as
cape
abou
mohammed
does
not
exceed
four
thousand
souls
in
years
of
dearth
even
this
small
number
is
sometimes
at
a
loss
to
find
pasturage
for
their
cattle
the
towara
are
some
of
the
poorest
of
the
bedouin
tribes
which
is
to
be
attributed
principally
to
the
scarcity
of
rain
and
the
consequent
want
of
pasturage
their
herds
are
scanty
and
they
have
few
camels
neither
of
their
two
sheikhs
the
richest
individuals
amongst
them
possesses
more
than
eight
few
tents
have
more
than
two
it
often
happens
that
two
or
three
persons
are
partners
in
one
camel
and
great
numbers
are
without
any
there
are
no
horses
even
among
the
sheikhs
who
constantly
ride
on
camels
but
asses
are
common
their
means
of
subsistence
are
derived
from
their
pastures
the
transport
trade
between
suez
and
cairo
the
sale
at
the
latter
place
of
the
charcoal
which
they
burn
in
their
mountains
of
the
gum
arabic
which
they
collect
and
of
their
dates
and
other
fruits
the
produce
of
this
trade
is
laid
out
by
them
at
cairo
in
purchasing
clothing
and
provisions
particularly
corn
for
the
supply
of
their
families
and
if
any
thing
remains
in
hand
they
buy
with
it
a
few
sheep
and
goats
at
tor
or
at
sherm
to
which
latter
place
they
are
brought
by
the
bedouins
of
the
opposite
coast
of
arabia
when
egypt
was
under
the
unsettled
government
of
the
mamelouks
the
towara
bedouins
who
were
then
independent
were
very
formidable
and
often
at
war
with
the
begs
as
well
as
with
the
surrounding
tribes
at
present
they
have
lost
much
of
the
profits
which
they
derived
from
their
traffic
with
suez
and
from
the
passage
of
caravans
to
cairo
they
are
kept
in
awe
by
mohammed
ali
and
have
taken
to
more
peaceful
habits
which
however
they
are
quite
ready
to
abandon
on
the
first
appearance
of
any
change
in
the
government
of
egypt
even
now
they
pay
no
duty
whatever
to
the
pasha
who
on
the
contrary
makes
their
chief
some
annual
presents
but
they
are
obliged
to
submit
to
the
rate
of
carriage
which
the
pasha
chooses
to
fix
for
the
transport
of
his
goods
they
live
of
course
according
to
their
means
the
small
sum
of
fifteen
or
twenty
dollars
pays
the
yearly
expenses
of
many
perhaps
of
most
of
their
families
and
the
daily
and
almost
unvarying
food
of
the
greater
part
of
them
is
bread
with
a
little
butter
or
milk
for
which
salt
alone
is
substituted
when
the
dry
season
is
set
in
and
their
cattle
no
longer
yield
milk
the
mezeine
appeared
to
me
much
hardier
than
the
other
tribes
owing
probably
to
their
being
exposed
to
greater
privations
in
the
more
barren
district
which
they
inhabit
they
hold
more
intercourse
with
the
neighbouring
bedouins
to
the
north
than
the
other
towaras
and
in
their
language
and
manners
approach
more
to
the
great
eastern
tribes
than
to
the
other
bedouins
of
the
peninsula
all
the
tribes
of
the
towara
complain
of
the
sterility
of
their
wives
they
wish
for
children
because
their
tribe
is
strengthened
by
it
but
providence
seems
to
have
wisely
proportioned
the
fertility
of
their
women
to
the
barrenness
of
the
country
and
though
the
bedouin
women
in
general
are
less
fruitful
than
the
stationary
arabs
the
towara
are
even
below
the
other
bedouins
in
this
respect
three
children
being
a
large
family
among
them
to
the
true
bedouin
tribes
above
enumerated
are
to
be
added
the
advenae
called
djebalye
arabic
or
the
mountaineers
i
have
stated
that
when
justinian
built
the
convent
he
sent
a
party
of
slaves
originally
from
the
shores
of
the
black
sea
as
menial
servants
to
the
priests
these
people
came
here
with
their
wives
and
were
settled
by
the
convent
as
guardians
of
the
orchards
and
date
plantations
throughout
the
peninsula
subsequently
when
the
bedouins
deprived
the
convent
of
many
of
its
possessions
these
slaves
turned
moslems
and
adopted
the
habits
of
bedouins
their
descendants
are
the
present
djebalye
who
unanimously
confess
their
descent
from
the
christian
slaves
whence
they
are
often
called
by
the
other
bedouins
children
of
they
are
not
to
be
distinguished
however
in
features
or
manners
from
other
bedouins
and
they
are
now
considered
a
branch
of
the
towara
although
the
latter
still
maintain
the
distinction
never
giving
their
daughters
in
marriage
to
the
djebalye
nor
taking
any
of
theirs
thus
the
djebalye
intermarry
only
among
themselves
and
form
a
separate
commmunity
of
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
armed
men
they
are
a
very
robust
and
hardy
race
and
their
girls
have
the
reputation
of
superior
beauty
over
all
others
of
the
peninsula
a
circumstance
which
often
gives
rise
to
unhappy
attachments
and
romantic
when
their
lovers
happen
to
belong
to
other
tribes
the
djebalye
still
remain
the
servants
of
the
convent
parties
of
three
attend
in
it
by
turns
and
are
the
only
bedouins
who
are
permitted
to
enter
within
the
walls
but
they
are
never
allowed
to
sleep
in
the
house
and
pass
the
night
in
the
garden
they
provide
collect
dried
herbage
for
the
mule
which
turns
the
mill
bring
milk
eggs
and
receive
all
the
offals
of
the
kitchen
some
of
them
encamp
as
bedouins
in
the
mountains
surrounding
the
peaks
of
moses
and
catherine
but
the
greater
part
are
settled
in
the
gardens
belonging
to
the
convent
in
those
mountains
they
engage
to
deliver
the
fruit
to
the
convent
but
as
these
gardens
produce
the
finest
fruit
in
the
peninsula
they
are
so
beset
by
bedouin
guests
at
the
time
of
gathering
that
the
share
is
usually
consumed
in
hospitality
the
djebalye
have
formed
a
strict
alliance
with
the
korashy
that
branch
of
the
szowaleha
which
has
no
claims
of
protectorship
upon
the
convent
and
by
these
means
they
have
maintained
from
ancient
times
a
certain
balance
of
power
against
the
other
szowaleha
they
have
no
right
to
transport
pilgrims
to
the
convent
and
are
in
general
considered
as
although
they
have
become
bedouins
in
every
respect
they
are
divided
into
several
smaller
tribes
some
of
whom
have
become
settlers
thus
the
tebna
are
settled
in
the
date
valley
of
feiran
in
gardens
nominally
the
property
of
the
convent
the
bezya
in
the
gardens
at
tor
and
the
sattla
in
other
parts
forming
a
few
families
whom
the
true
bedouins
stigmatize
with
the
opprobrious
name
of
fellahs
or
peasants
the
monks
told
me
that
in
the
last
century
there
still
remained
several
families
of
christian
bedouins
who
had
not
embraced
islamism
and
that
the
last
individual
of
this
description
an
old
woman
died
in
and
was
buried
in
the
garden
of
the
convent
in
this
garden
is
the
of
the
monks
and
in
several
adjoining
vaulted
chambers
their
remains
are
collected
after
the
bodies
have
lain
two
years
in
the
coffins
underground
high
piles
of
hands
shin
bones
and
sculls
are
placed
separately
in
the
different
corners
of
these
chambers
which
the
monks
are
with
difficulty
persuaded
to
open
to
strangers
in
a
row
of
wooden
chests
are
deposited
the
bones
of
the
archbishops
of
the
convent
which
are
regularly
sent
hither
wherever
the
archbishops
may
die
in
another
small
chest
are
shewn
the
sculls
and
some
of
the
bones
of
two
princes
who
are
said
to
have
been
shipwrecked
on
the
coast
of
tor
and
having
repaired
to
the
convent
to
have
lived
for
many
years
as
hermits
in
two
small
adjoining
caves
upon
the
mountain
of
moses
in
order
to
remain
inseparable
in
this
world
they
bound
two
of
their
legs
together
with
an
iron
chain
part
of
which
with
a
small
piece
of
a
coat
of
mail
which
they
wore
under
their
cloaks
is
still
preserved
no
one
could
tell
me
their
names
nor
the
period
at
which
they
resided
here
at
the
djebel
mousa
entrance
of
the
charnel
houses
is
the
picture
of
the
hoary
onuphrius
he
is
said
to
have
been
an
egyptian
prince
and
subsequently
one
of
the
first
monks
of
djebel
mousa
in
which
capacity
he
performed
many
miracles
after
two
days
repose
in
the
convent
and
its
delightful
garden
i
set
out
for
the
holy
places
around
it
a
pilgrimage
which
i
had
deferred
making
immediately
on
my
first
arrival
which
is
the
usual
practice
that
the
arabs
might
not
confound
me
with
the
common
run
of
visitors
to
whom
they
shew
no
great
respect
the
djebalye
enjoy
the
exclusive
right
of
being
guides
to
the
holy
places
my
suite
therefore
consisted
of
two
of
them
loaded
with
provisions
together
with
my
servant
and
a
young
greek
the
latter
had
been
a
sailor
in
the
red
sea
and
appeared
to
have
turned
monk
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
getting
his
fill
of
brandy
from
the
cellar
may
were
in
motion
before
sunrise
for
the
djebel
mousa
or
mountain
of
moses
the
road
to
which
begins
to
ascend
immediately
behind
the
walls
of
the
convent
regular
steps
were
formerly
cut
all
the
way
up
but
they
are
now
either
entirely
destroyed
or
so
much
damaged
by
the
winter
torrents
as
to
be
of
very
little
use
after
ascending
for
about
minutes
we
breathed
a
short
time
under
a
large
impending
rock
close
by
which
is
a
small
well
of
water
as
cold
as
ice
at
the
end
of
three
quarters
of
an
steep
ascent
we
came
to
a
small
plain
the
entrance
to
which
from
below
is
through
a
stone
gateway
which
in
former
times
was
probably
closed
a
little
beneath
it
stands
amidst
the
rocks
a
small
church
dedicated
to
the
virgin
on
the
plain
is
a
larger
building
of
rude
construction
which
bears
the
name
of
the
convent
of
elias
it
was
lately
inhabited
but
is
now
abandoned
the
monks
repairing
here
only
at
certain
times
of
the
year
to
read
mass
pilgrims
usually
halt
on
this
spot
where
a
tall
cypress
tree
grows
by
the
side
of
a
stone
tank
which
receives
the
winter
rains
on
a
large
rock
in
the
plain
are
several
arabic
inscriptions
engraved
by
pilgrims
three
or
four
hundred
years
ago
i
saw
one
also
in
the
syriac
language
according
to
the
koran
and
the
moslem
traditions
it
was
in
this
part
of
the
mountain
which
is
called
djebel
oreb
or
horeb
that
moses
communicated
with
the
lord
from
hence
a
still
steeper
ascent
of
half
an
hour
the
steps
of
which
are
also
in
ruins
leads
to
the
summit
of
djebel
mousa
where
stands
the
church
which
forms
the
principal
object
of
the
pilgrimage
it
is
built
on
the
very
peak
of
the
mountain
the
plane
of
which
is
at
most
sixty
paces
in
circumference
the
church
though
strongly
built
with
granite
is
now
greatly
dilapidated
by
the
unremitted
attempts
of
the
arabs
to
destroy
it
the
door
roof
and
walls
are
greatly
injured
szaleh
the
present
sheikh
of
the
towara
with
his
tribe
the
korashy
was
the
principal
instrument
in
the
work
of
destruction
because
not
being
entitled
to
any
tribute
from
the
convent
they
are
particularly
hostile
to
the
monks
some
ruins
round
the
church
indicate
that
a
much
larger
and
more
solid
building
once
stood
here
and
the
rock
appears
to
have
been
cut
perpendicularly
with
great
labour
to
prevent
any
other
approach
to
it
than
by
the
southern
side
the
view
from
this
summit
must
be
very
grand
but
a
thick
fog
prevented
me
from
seeing
even
the
nearest
mountains
about
thirty
paces
from
the
church
on
a
somewhat
lower
peak
stands
a
poor
mosque
without
any
ornaments
held
in
great
veneration
by
the
moslems
and
the
place
of
their
pilgrimage
it
is
frequently
visited
by
the
bedouins
who
slaughter
sheep
in
honour
of
moses
and
who
make
vows
to
him
and
intreat
his
intercession
in
heaven
in
their
favour
there
is
a
on
which
the
bedouins
come
hither
in
a
mass
and
offer
their
sacrifices
i
was
told
that
formerly
they
never
approached
the
place
without
being
dressed
in
the
ihram
or
sacred
mantle
with
which
the
moslems
cover
their
naked
bodies
on
visiting
mekka
and
which
then
consisted
only
of
a
napkin
tied
round
the
middle
but
this
custom
has
been
abandoned
for
the
last
forty
years
foreign
moslem
pilgrims
often
repair
to
the
spot
and
even
mohammed
ali
pasha
and
his
son
tousoun
pasha
gave
notice
that
they
intended
to
visit
it
but
they
did
not
keep
their
promise
close
by
the
footpath
in
the
ascent
from
elias
to
this
summit
and
at
a
small
distance
from
it
a
place
is
shown
in
the
rock
which
somewhat
resembles
the
print
of
the
fore
part
of
the
foot
it
is
stated
to
have
been
made
by
foot
when
he
visited
the
mountain
we
found
the
adjacent
part
of
the
rock
sprinkled
with
blood
in
consequence
of
an
accident
which
happened
a
few
days
ago
to
a
turkish
lady
of
rank
who
was
on
her
way
from
cairo
to
mekka
with
her
son
and
who
had
resided
for
some
weeks
in
the
convent
during
which
she
made
the
tour
of
the
sacred
places
bare
footed
although
she
was
old
and
decrepid
in
attempting
to
kiss
the
mark
of
foot
she
fell
and
wounded
her
head
but
not
so
severely
as
to
prevent
her
from
pursuing
her
pilgrimage
somewhat
below
the
mosque
is
a
fine
reservoir
cut
very
deep
in
the
granite
rock
for
the
reception
of
rain
water
the
arabs
believe
that
the
tables
of
the
commandments
are
buried
beneath
the
pavement
of
the
church
on
djebel
mousa
and
they
have
made
excavations
on
every
side
in
the
hope
of
finding
them
they
more
particularly
revere
this
spot
from
a
belief
that
the
rains
which
fall
in
the
peninsula
are
under
the
immediate
control
of
moses
and
they
are
persuaded
that
the
priests
of
the
convent
are
in
possession
of
the
taourat
a
book
sent
down
to
moses
from
heaven
upon
the
opening
and
shutting
of
which
depend
the
rains
of
the
peninsula
the
reputation
which
the
monks
have
thus
obtained
of
having
the
dispensation
of
the
rains
in
their
hands
has
become
very
troublesome
to
them
but
they
have
brought
it
on
by
their
own
measures
for
enhancing
their
credit
with
the
bedouins
in
times
of
dearth
they
were
accustomed
to
proceed
in
a
body
to
djebel
mousa
to
pray
for
rain
and
they
encouraged
the
belief
that
the
rain
was
due
to
their
intercessions
by
a
natural
inference
the
bedouins
have
concluded
that
if
the
monks
could
bring
rain
they
had
it
likewise
in
their
power
to
withhold
it
and
the
consequence
is
that
whenever
a
dearth
happens
they
accuse
the
monks
of
malevolence
and
often
tumultuously
assemble
and
compel
them
to
repair
to
the
mountain
to
pray
some
years
since
soon
after
an
occurrence
of
this
kind
it
happened
that
a
violent
flood
burst
over
the
peninsula
and
destroyed
many
date
trees
a
bedouin
whose
camel
and
sheep
had
been
swept
away
by
the
torrent
went
in
a
fury
to
the
convent
and
fired
his
gun
at
it
and
when
asked
the
reason
exclaimed
have
opened
the
book
so
much
that
we
are
all
drowned
he
was
pacified
by
presents
but
on
departing
he
begged
that
in
future
the
monks
would
only
half
open
the
taourat
in
order
that
the
rains
might
be
more
moderate
the
supposed
influence
of
the
monks
is
however
sometimes
attended
with
more
fortunate
results
the
sheikh
szaleh
had
never
been
father
of
a
male
child
and
on
being
told
that
providence
had
thus
punished
him
for
his
enmity
to
the
convent
he
two
years
ago
brought
a
load
of
butter
to
the
monks
and
entreated
them
to
go
to
the
mountain
and
pray
that
his
wife
who
was
then
pregnant
might
be
delivered
of
a
son
the
monks
complied
and
szaleh
soon
after
became
the
happy
father
of
a
fine
boy
since
that
period
he
has
been
the
friend
of
the
convent
and
has
even
partly
repaired
the
church
on
djebel
mousa
this
summit
was
formerly
inhabited
by
the
monks
but
at
present
they
visit
it
only
in
time
of
festivals
bir
shonnar
we
returned
to
the
convent
of
elias
and
then
descended
on
the
western
side
of
the
mountain
for
half
an
hour
by
another
decayed
flight
of
steps
into
a
valley
where
is
a
small
convent
called
el
erbayn
or
the
forty
it
is
in
good
repair
and
is
at
present
inhabited
by
a
family
of
djebalye
who
take
care
of
the
garden
annexed
to
it
which
affords
a
pleasing
place
of
rest
to
those
who
descend
from
the
barren
mountains
above
in
its
neighbourhood
are
extensive
olive
plantations
but
i
was
told
that
for
the
last
five
summers
the
locusts
had
devoured
both
the
fruit
and
foliage
of
these
trees
upon
which
they
alight
in
preference
to
all
others
this
insect
is
not
less
dreaded
here
than
in
arabia
syria
and
egypt
but
the
bedouins
of
mount
sinai
unlike
those
of
arabia
instead
of
eating
them
hold
them
in
great
abhorrence
we
passed
the
hours
at
elias
and
towards
evening
ascended
the
mountain
opposite
to
that
of
mousa
which
forms
the
western
cliff
of
this
narrow
valley
after
proceeding
about
an
hour
we
stopped
near
a
small
well
where
we
found
several
huts
of
djebalye
and
cleared
a
place
among
the
rocks
where
our
party
encamped
for
the
night
the
well
is
called
bir
shonnar
arabic
from
the
circumstance
of
a
monk
who
was
wandering
in
these
mountains
and
nearly
dying
of
thirst
having
miraculously
discovered
it
by
seeing
the
bird
shonnar
fly
up
from
the
spot
it
is
closely
surrounded
by
rocks
and
is
not
more
than
a
foot
in
diameter
and
as
much
in
depth
the
bedouins
say
that
it
never
dries
up
and
that
its
water
even
when
exposed
to
the
sun
is
as
cold
as
ice
several
trees
grow
near
it
amongst
others
the
zarour
arabic
now
almost
in
full
bloom
its
fruit
of
the
size
of
a
small
cherry
with
much
of
the
flavour
of
a
strawberry
is
i
believe
not
a
native
of
egypt
but
is
very
common
in
syria
i
bought
a
lamb
of
the
bedouins
which
we
roasted
among
the
rocks
and
although
there
were
only
two
women
and
one
girl
present
and
the
steep
side
of
the
mountain
hardly
permitted
a
person
to
stand
up
with
firmness
and
still
less
to
wheel
about
yet
the
greater
part
of
the
night
was
spent
in
the
mesámer
or
national
song
and
dance
to
which
several
other
neighbouring
djebalye
were
attracted
the
air
was
delightfully
cool
and
pure
while
in
the
lower
country
and
particularly
on
the
sea
shore
i
found
the
thermometer
often
at
and
once
even
at
in
the
convent
it
never
stood
higher
than
the
semoum
wind
never
reaches
these
upper
regions
in
winter
the
whole
of
the
upper
sinai
is
deeply
covered
with
snow
which
chokes
up
many
of
the
passes
and
often
renders
the
mountains
of
moses
and
catherine
inaccessible
the
climate
is
so
different
from
that
of
egypt
that
fruits
are
nearly
two
months
later
in
ripening
here
than
at
cairo
apricots
which
begin
to
be
in
season
there
in
the
last
days
of
april
are
not
fit
to
eat
in
sinai
till
the
middle
of
june
may
left
our
before
and
climbed
up
a
steep
ascent
where
there
had
formerly
been
steps
which
are
now
entirely
destroyed
this
side
of
djebel
katerin
or
mount
catherine
is
noted
for
its
excellent
pasturage
herbs
sprout
up
every
where
between
the
rocks
and
as
many
of
them
are
odoriferous
the
scent
early
in
the
morning
when
the
dew
falls
is
delicious
the
zattar
arabic
ocimum
zatarhendi
was
particularly
conspicuous
and
is
esteemed
here
the
best
possible
food
for
sheep
in
the
month
of
june
when
the
herbs
are
in
blossom
the
monks
are
in
the
habit
of
repairing
to
this
and
the
surrounding
mountains
in
order
to
collect
various
herbs
which
they
dry
and
send
to
the
convent
at
cairo
from
whence
they
are
dispatched
to
the
archbishop
of
sinai
at
constantinople
who
distributes
them
to
his
friends
and
dependents
they
are
supposed
to
possess
many
virtues
conducive
to
health
a
botanist
would
find
a
rich
harvest
here
and
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
two
mountains
so
easy
of
access
and
so
rich
in
vegetation
as
sinai
and
libanus
should
be
still
unexplored
by
men
of
science
the
pretty
red
flower
of
the
noman
plant
arabic
euphorbia
retusa
of
forskal
abounds
in
al
l
the
valleys
of
sinai
and
is
seen
also
amongst
the
most
barren
granite
rocks
of
the
mountains
as
we
approached
the
summit
of
the
mountain
we
saw
at
a
distance
a
small
flock
of
mountain
goats
feeding
among
the
rocks
one
of
our
arabs
left
us
and
by
a
widely
circuitous
road
endeavoured
to
get
to
leeward
of
them
and
near
enough
to
fire
at
them
he
enjoined
us
to
remain
in
sight
of
them
and
to
sit
down
in
order
not
to
alarm
them
he
had
nearly
reached
a
favourable
spot
behind
a
rock
when
the
goats
suddenly
took
to
flight
they
could
not
have
seen
the
arab
but
the
wind
changed
and
thus
they
smelt
him
the
chase
of
the
beden
as
the
wild
goat
is
called
resembles
that
of
the
chamois
of
the
alps
and
requires
as
much
enterprise
and
patience
the
arabs
make
long
circuits
to
surprise
them
and
endeavour
to
come
upon
them
early
in
the
morning
when
they
feed
the
goats
have
a
leader
who
keeps
watch
and
on
any
suspicious
smell
sound
or
object
makes
a
noise
which
is
a
signal
to
the
flock
to
make
their
escape
they
have
much
decreased
of
late
if
we
may
believe
the
arabs
who
say
that
fifty
years
ago
if
a
stranger
came
to
a
tent
and
the
owner
of
it
had
no
sheep
to
kill
he
took
his
gun
and
went
in
search
of
a
beden
they
are
however
even
now
more
common
than
in
the
alps
or
in
the
mountains
to
the
east
of
the
red
sea
i
had
three
or
four
of
them
brought
to
me
at
the
convent
which
i
bought
at
threefourths
of
a
dollar
each
the
flesh
is
excellent
and
has
nearly
the
same
flavour
as
that
of
the
deer
the
bedouins
make
waterbags
of
their
skins
and
rings
of
their
horns
which
they
wear
on
their
thumbs
when
the
beden
is
met
with
in
the
plains
the
dogs
of
the
hunters
easily
catch
him
but
they
can
not
come
up
with
him
among
the
rocks
where
he
can
make
leaps
of
twenty
feet
the
stout
bedouin
youths
are
all
hunters
and
excellent
marksmen
they
hold
it
a
great
honour
to
bring
game
to
their
tents
in
proof
of
their
being
hardy
mountain
runners
and
good
shots
and
the
epithet
bowardy
yknos
arabic
marksman
who
hunts
the
game
is
one
of
the
most
flattering
that
can
be
bestowed
upon
them
it
appears
from
an
ancient
picture
preserved
in
the
convent
which
represents
the
arrival
of
an
archbishop
from
egypt
as
well
as
from
one
of
the
written
documents
in
the
archives
that
in
the
sixteenth
century
all
the
arabs
were
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
as
well
as
with
matchlocks
at
present
the
former
are
no
longer
known
but
almost
every
tent
has
its
matchlock
which
the
men
use
with
great
address
notwithstanding
its
bad
condition
i
believe
bows
are
no
longer
used
as
regular
weapons
by
the
bedouins
in
any
part
of
arabia
after
a
very
slow
ascent
of
two
hours
we
reached
the
top
of
mount
catherine
which
like
the
mountain
of
moses
terminates
in
a
sharp
point
its
highest
part
consists
of
a
single
immense
block
of
granite
whose
surface
is
so
smooth
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
ascend
it
luxuriant
vegetation
reaches
up
to
this
rock
and
the
side
of
the
mountain
presented
a
verdure
which
had
it
been
of
turf
instead
of
shrubs
and
herbs
would
have
completed
the
resemblance
between
this
mountain
and
some
of
the
alpine
summits
there
is
nothing
on
the
summit
of
the
rock
to
attract
attention
except
a
small
church
or
chapel
hardly
high
enough
within
to
allow
a
person
to
stand
upright
and
badly
built
of
loose
uncemented
stones
the
floor
is
the
bare
rock
in
which
solid
as
it
is
the
body
of
catherine
is
believed
to
have
been
miraculously
buried
by
angels
after
her
martyrdom
at
alexandria
i
saw
inscribed
here
the
names
of
several
european
travellers
and
among
others
that
of
the
unfortunate
boutin
a
french
officer
of
engineers
who
passed
here
in
m
boutin
came
to
egypt
from
zante
he
first
made
a
journey
to
the
cataracts
of
assouan
and
then
went
to
bosseir
where
he
hired
a
ship
for
mokha
but
on
reaching
yembo
tousoun
pasha
the
son
of
mohammed
ali
would
not
permit
him
to
proceed
he
therefore
returned
to
suez
after
visiting
the
convent
of
sinai
and
its
neighbouring
mountains
after
his
return
to
cairo
he
went
to
siwah
to
examine
the
remains
of
the
temple
of
jupiter
ammon
carrying
with
him
a
small
boat
built
at
cairo
for
the
purpose
of
exploring
the
lake
and
the
island
in
it
mentioned
by
browne
he
experienced
great
vexations
from
the
inhabitants
of
siwah
and
the
boat
was
of
no
use
to
him
owing
to
the
shallowness
of
the
lake
so
that
after
a
residence
of
three
days
at
the
oasis
where
he
seems
to
have
made
no
discoveries
he
returned
to
cairo
in
the
company
of
some
augila
merchants
on
his
way
he
passed
the
wood
of
petrified
date
trees
discovered
by
horneman
his
route
i
believe
was
to
the
south
of
that
of
horneman
and
nearer
the
lesser
oasis
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
upon
his
return
from
siwah
when
i
first
arrived
at
cairo
he
remained
two
years
in
egypt
and
then
continued
his
travels
towards
syria
where
he
met
with
his
death
in
in
the
mountainous
district
of
the
nosayris
west
of
hamah
having
imprudently
exposed
himself
with
a
great
deal
of
baggage
in
company
only
of
his
interpreter
and
servant
and
without
any
native
guide
to
the
robbers
of
that
infamous
tribe
he
was
a
lover
of
truth
and
a
man
of
observation
and
enterprize
the
public
therefore
and
his
own
government
have
to
regret
his
death
no
less
than
his
friends
from
this
elevated
peak
a
very
extensive
view
opened
before
us
and
the
direction
of
the
different
surroundings
chains
of
mountains
could
be
distinctly
traced
the
upper
nucleus
of
the
sinai
composed
almost
entirely
of
granite
forms
a
rocky
wilderness
of
all
irregular
circular
shape
intersected
by
many
narrow
valleys
and
from
thirty
to
forty
miles
in
diameter
it
contains
the
highest
mountains
of
the
peninsula
whose
shaggy
and
pointed
peaks
and
steep
and
shattered
sides
render
it
clearly
distinguishable
from
all
the
rest
of
the
country
in
view
it
is
upon
this
highest
region
of
the
peninsula
that
the
fertile
valleys
are
found
which
produce
fruit
trees
they
are
principally
to
the
west
and
of
the
convent
at
three
or
four
hours
distant
water
too
is
always
found
in
plenty
in
this
district
on
which
account
it
is
the
place
of
refuge
of
all
the
bedouins
when
the
low
country
is
parched
up
i
think
it
very
probable
that
this
upper
country
or
wilderness
is
exclusively
the
desert
of
sinai
so
often
mentioned
in
the
account
of
the
wanderings
of
the
israelites
mount
catherine
appears
to
stand
nearly
in
the
centre
of
it
to
the
northward
of
this
central
region
and
divided
from
it
by
the
broad
valley
called
wady
el
sheikh
and
by
several
minor
wadys
begins
a
lower
range
of
mountains
called
zebeir
which
extends
eastwards
having
at
one
extremity
the
two
peaks
called
el
djoze
arabic
above
the
plantations
of
wady
feiran
and
losing
itself
to
the
east
in
the
more
open
country
towards
wady
sal
beyond
the
zebeir
northwards
are
sandy
plains
and
valleys
which
i
crossed
towards
the
west
at
raml
el
moral
and
towards
the
east
about
part
i
s
the
most
barren
and
destitute
of
water
of
the
whole
country
at
its
eastern
extremity
it
is
called
el
birka
arabic
it
borders
to
the
north
on
the
chain
of
el
tyh
which
stretches
in
a
regular
line
eastwards
parallel
with
the
zebeir
beginning
at
sarbout
el
djeinel
on
reaching
in
its
eastern
course
the
somewhat
higher
mountain
called
el
odjme
arabic
it
separates
into
two
one
of
its
branches
turns
off
in
a
right
angle
northward
and
after
continuing
for
about
fifteen
miles
in
that
direction
again
turns
to
the
east
and
extends
parallel
with
the
second
and
southern
branch
all
across
the
peninsula
towards
the
eastern
gulf
the
northern
branch
which
is
called
el
dhelel
arabic
bounds
the
view
from
mount
catherine
on
turning
to
the
east
i
found
that
the
mountains
in
this
direction
beyond
the
high
district
of
sinai
run
in
a
lower
range
towards
the
wady
sal
and
that
the
slope
of
the
upper
mountains
is
much
less
abrupt
than
on
the
opposite
side
from
sal
east
and
the
chains
intersect
each
other
in
many
irregular
masses
of
inferior
height
till
they
reach
the
gulf
of
akaba
which
i
clearly
distinguished
when
the
sun
was
just
rising
over
the
mountains
of
the
arabian
coast
excepting
the
short
extent
from
noweyba
to
dahab
the
mountains
bordering
on
the
gulf
are
all
of
secondary
height
but
they
rise
to
a
considerable
elevation
between
those
two
points
the
country
between
sherm
nabk
and
the
convent
is
occupied
also
by
mountains
of
minor
size
and
the
valleys
generally
are
so
narrow
that
few
of
them
can
be
distinguished
from
the
point
where
i
stood
the
whole
country
in
that
direction
appearing
an
uninterrupted
wilderness
of
barren
mountains
the
highest
points
on
that
side
appear
to
be
above
wady
kyd
above
the
valley
of
naszeb
and
principally
the
peaks
called
om
kheysyn
arabic
and
masaoud
arabic
the
view
to
the
south
was
bounded
by
the
high
mountain
of
om
shomar
arabic
which
forms
a
nucleus
of
itself
apparently
unconnected
with
the
upper
sinai
although
bordering
close
upon
it
to
the
right
of
this
mountain
i
could
distinguish
the
sea
in
the
neighbourhood
of
tor
near
which
begins
a
low
calcareous
chain
of
mountains
called
djebel
hemam
death
not
hamam
or

extending
along
the
gulf
of

separated
from

plain
called
el

arabic
across
which
the
road
from

passes
this
plain
terminates
to
the
of
mount
catherine
and
nearly
in
the
direction
of
djebel
serbal
towards
the
kaa
the
central

mountains
are
very
abrupt
and
leave
no
secondary
intermediate
chain
between
them
and
the
plain
at
their
feet
the
mountain
of
serbal
which
i
afterwards
visited
is
separated
from
the
upper

by
some
valleys
especially
wady
hebran
and
it
forms
with
several
neighbouring
mountains
a
separate
cluster
terminating
in
peaks
the
highest
of
which
appears
to
be
as
high
as

it
borders
on
the
wady

the

took

these
together
with
those
which
i
took
from
the
peak
of

the
distances

of

different

serve

the
highest
in
making
the
preceding
observations
i
was
obliged
to
take
out
my
compass
and
pencil
which
greatly
surprised
the
arabs
who
seeing
me
in
an
arab
dress
and
speaking
their
language
yet
having
the
same
pursuits
as
the
frank
travellers
whom
they
had
seen
here
were
quite
at
a
loss
what
to
make
of
me
the
suspicion
was
immediately
excited
that
i
had
ascended
this
mountain
to
practise
some
enchantment
and
it
was
much
increased
by
my
further
proceedings
the
bedouins
supposed
that
i
had
come
to
carry
off
the
rain
and
my
return
to
cairo
was
in
consequence
much
less
agreeable
than
my
journey
from
thence
indeed
i
might
have
been
subjected
to
el
ledja
some
unpleasant
occurrences
had
not
the
faithful
hamd
been
by
my
side
who
in
the
route
back
was
of
more
service
to
me
than
all
the
firmahns
of
the
pasha
could
have
been
we
returned
from
mount
catherine
to
the
place
where
we
had
passed
the
night
and
breakfasted
with
the
djebalye
for
which
payment
was
asked
and
readily
given
the
conveying
of
pilgrims
is
one
of
the
few
modes
of
subsistence
which
these
poor
people
possess
and
at
a
place
where
strangers
are
continually
passing
gratuitous
hospitality
is
not
to
be
expected
from
them
though
they
might
be
ready
to
afford
it
to
the
helpless
traveller
the
two
days
excursion
to
the
holy
places
cost
me
about
forty
piastres
or
five
dollars
before
we
had
again
reached
the
convent
el
erbayn
in
the
garden
of
which
i
passed
a
most
agreeable
afternoon
the
verdure
was
so
brilliant
and
the
blossoms
of
the
orange
trees
diffused
so
fine
a
perfume
that
i
was
transported
in
imagination
from
the
barren
cliffs
of
the
wilderness
to
the
luxurious
groves
of
antioch
it
is
surprising
that
the
europeans
resident
at
cairo
do
not
prefer
spending
the
season
of
the
plague
in
these
pleasant
gardens
and
this
delightful
climate
to
remaining
close
prisoners
in
the
infected
city
we
returned
in
the
evening
to
the
convent
by
following
to
the
northward
the
valley
in
which
the
erbayn
stands
this
valley
is
very
narrow
and
extremely
stony
many
large
blocks
having
rolled
from
the
mountains
into
it
it
is
called
el
ledja
arabic
a
name
given
to
a
similar
rocky
district
described
by
me
in
the
haouran
at
twenty
minutes
walk
from
the
erbayn
we
passed
a
block
of
granite
said
to
be
the
rock
out
of
which
the
water
issued
when
struck
by
the
rod
of
moses
it
lies
quite
insulated
by
the
side
of
the
path
which
is
about
ten
feet
higher
than
the
lowest
bottom
of
the
valley
the
rock
is
about
twelve
feet
in
height
of
an
irregular
shape
approaching
to
a
cube
there
are
some
apertures
upon
its
surface
through
which
the
water
is
said
to
have
burst
out
they
are
about
twenty
in
number
and
lie
nearly
in
a
straight
line
round
the
three
sides
of
the
stone
they
are
for
the
most
part
ten
or
twelve
inches
long
two
or
three
inches
broad
and
from
one
to
two
inches
deep
but
a
few
of
them
are
as
deep
as
four
inches
every
observer
must
be
convinced
on
the
slightest
examination
that
most
of
these
fissures
are
the
work
of
art
but
three
or
four
perhaps
are
natural
and
these
may
have
first
drawn
the
attention
of
the
monks
to
the
stone
and
have
induced
them
to
call
it
the
rock
of
the
miraculous
supply
of
water
besides
the
marks
of
art
evident
in
the
holes
themselves
the
spaces
between
them
have
been
chiselled
so
as
to
make
it
appear
as
if
the
stone
had
been
worn
in
those
parts
by
the
action
of
the
water
though
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
if
water
had
flowed
from
the
fissures
it
must
generally
have
taken
quite
a
different
direction
one
traveller
saw
on
this
stone
twelve
openings
answering
to
the
number
of
the
tribes
of
israel
breydenbach
another
sicard
mémoires
des
missions
describes
the
holes
as
a
foot
deep
they
were
probably
told
so
by
the
monks
and
believed
what
they
heard
rather
than
what
they
saw
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
paces
farther
on
in
the
valley
lies
another
piece
of
rock
upon
which
it
seems
that
the
work
of
deception
was
first
begun
there
being
four
or
five
apertures
cut
in
it
similar
to
those
on
the
other
block
but
in
a
less
finished
state
as
it
is
somewhat
smaller
than
the
former
and
lies
in
a
less
conspicuous
part
of
the
valley
removed
from
the
public
path
the
monks
probably
thought
proper
in
process
of
time
to
assign
the
miracle
to
the
other
as
the
rock
of
moses
has
been
described
by
travellers
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
deception
must
have
originated
among
the
monks
of
an
earlier
period
as
to
the
present
inhabitants
of
the
convent
and
of
the
peninsula
they
must
be
acquitted
of
any
fraud
respecting
it
for
they
conscientiously
believe
that
it
is
the
very
rock
from
whence
the
water
gushed
forth
in
this
part
of
the
peninsula
the
israelites
could
not
have
suffered
from
thirst
the
upper
sinai
is
full
of
wells
and
springs
the
greater
part
of
which
are
perennial
and
on
whichever
side
the
pretended
rock
of
moses
is
approached
copious
sources
are
found
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
it
the
rock
is
greatly
venerated
by
the
bedouins
who
put
grass
into
the
fissures
as
offerings
to
the
memory
of
moses
in
the
same
manner
as
they
place
grass
upon
the
tombs
of
their
saints
because
grass
is
to
them
the
most
precious
gift
of
nature
and
that
upon
which
their
existence
chiefly
depends
they
also
bring
hither
their
female
camels
for
they
believe
that
by
making
the
animal
couch
down
before
the
rock
while
they
recite
some
prayers
and
by
putting
fresh
grass
into
the
fissures
of
the
stone
the
camels
will
become
fertile
and
yield
an
abundance
of
milk
the
superstition
is
encouraged
by
the
monks
who
rejoice
to
see
the
infidel
bedouins
venerating
the
same
object
with
themselves
those
who
should
attempt
to
weaken
the
faith
of
the
monks
and
their
visitors
respecting
this
rock
would
be
now
almost
as
blameable
as
the
original
authors
of
the
imposture
for
such
is
the
ignorance
of
the
oriental
christians
and
the
impossibility
of
their
obtaining
any
salutary
instruction
under
the
turkish
government
that
were
their
faith
in
such
miracles
completely
shaken
their
religion
would
soon
be
entirely
overthrown
and
they
would
be
left
to
wander
in
all
the
darkness
of
atheism
it
is
curious
to
observe
the
blindness
with
which
christians
as
well
as
turks
believe
in
the
pretended
miracles
of
those
who
are
interested
in
deceiving
them
there
is
hardly
a
town
in
syria
or
egypt
where
the
moslems
have
not
a
living
saint
who
works
wonders
which
the
whole
population
is
ready
to
attest
as
when
i
was
at
damascus
in
some
christians
returned
thither
from
jerusalem
where
they
had
been
to
celebrate
easter
some
striking
miracles
said
to
have
been
performed
by
the
pope
during
his
imprisonment
at
savona
and
which
had
been
industriously
propagated
by
the
latin
priests
in
syria
seem
to
have
suggested
to
them
the
design
of
imitating
his
holiness
the
returning
pilgrims
unanimously
declared
that
when
the
spanish
priest
of
the
convent
of
the
holy
sepulchre
read
the
mass
on
easter
sunday
or
monday
upon
the
mount
of
olives
the
whole
assembled
congregation
saw
him
rise
while
behind
the
altar
two
or
three
feet
in
the
air
and
support
himself
in
that
position
for
several
minutes
in
giving
the
people
his
blessing
if
any
christian
of
damascus
had
expressed
his
doubts
of
the
truth
of
this
story
the
monks
of
the
convent
there
would
have
branded
him
with
the
epithet
of
framasoun
freemason
which
among
the
syrian
christians
is
synonymous
with
atheist
and
he
would
for
ever
have
lost
his
character
among
his
brethren
a
little
farther
down
than
the
rock
above
described
is
shewn
the
seat
of
moses
where
it
is
said
that
he
often
sat
it
is
a
small
and
apparently
natural
excavation
in
a
granite
rock
resembling
a
chair
near
this
is
the
pot
or
kettle
of
arabic
a
name
given
to
a
circular
projecting
knob
in
a
rock
similar
in
size
and
shape
to
the
lid
of
a
kettle
the
arabs
have
in
vain
endeavoured
to
break
this
rock
which
they
suppose
to
contain
great
treasures
as
we
proceeded
from
the
rock
of
the
miraculous
supply
of
water
along
the
valley
el
ledja
i
saw
upon
several
blocks
of
granite
whose
smooth
sides
were
turned
towards
the
path
inscriptions
similar
to
those
at
naszeb
the
following
were
the
most
legible
upon
a
small
block
not
included
not

not
included
there
are
many
effaced
lines
on
this
block
upon
a
rock
near
the
stone
of
moses
not
included
upon
a
block
close
to
the
above

not

upon
the
rock
called
the
pot
not
included
upon
a
large
insulated
block
of
granite
not
included
el
bostan
it
is
to
be
observed
that
none
of
these
inscriptions
are
found
higher
up
the
valley
than
the
water
rock
being
all
upon
blocks
on
the
way
from
thence
to
the
convent
which
seems
to
be
a
strong
proof
that
they
were
inscribed
by
those
persons
only
who
came
from
the
convent
or
from
cairo
to
visit
the
rock
and
not
by
pilgrims
in
their
way
to
the
mountain
of
moses
or
of
catherine
who
would
undoubtedly
have
left
some
record
farther
up
the
valley
and
more
particularly
upon
the
sides
and
summits
of
the
mountains
themselves
but
i
could
there
find
no
inscriptions
whatever
although
i
examined
the
ground
closely
and
saw
many
smooth
blocks
by
the
road
very
suitable
to
such
inscriptions
at
forty
minutes
walk
from
erbayn
where
the
valley
el
ledja
opens
into
the
broad
valley
which
leads
eastwards
to
the
convent
is
a
fine
garden
with
the
ruins
of
a
small
convent
called
el
bostan
water
is
conducted
into
it
by
a
small
channel
from
a
spring
in
the
ledja
it
was
full
of
apricot
trees
and
roses
in
full
blossom
a
few
djebalye
live
here
and
take
care
of
the
garden
from
hence
to
the
convent
is
half
an
hour
in
the
way
is
shewn
the
head
of
the
golden
calf
which
the
israelites
worshipped
transmuted
into
stone
it
is
somewhat
singular
that
both
the
monks
and
the
bedouins
call
it
the
head
ras
el
bakar
and
not
the
confounding
it
perhaps
with
the
heifer
of
which
the
old
testament
and
the
koran
speak
it
is
a
stone
in
the
ground
and
bears
some
resemblance
to
the
forehead
of
a
cow
some
travellers
have
explained
this
stone
to
be
the
mould
in
which
aaron
cast
the
calf
though
it
is
not
hollow
but
projecting
the
arabs
and
monks
however
gravely
assured
me
that
it
was
the
head
itself
beyond
this
object
towards
the
convent
a
hill
is
pointed
out
to
the
left
called
djebel
haroun
because
it
is
believed
to
be
the
spot
where
aaron
assembled
the
seventy
elders
of
israel
both
this
and
the
head
have
evidently
received
these
denominations
from
convent
of
mount
sinai
the
monks
and
bedouins
in
order
that
they
may
multiply
the
objects
of
veneration
and
curiosity
within
the
tour
round
the
convent
on
my
return
to
the
convent
i
could
not
help
expressing
to
several
of
the
monks
my
surprise
at
the
metamorphosis
of
a
calf
into
a
cow
and
of
an
idol
of
gold
into
stone
but
i
found
that
they
were
too
little
read
in
the
books
of
moses
to
understand
even
this
simple
question
and
i
therefore
did
not
press
the
subject
i
believe
there
is
not
a
single
individual
amongst
them
who
has
read
the
whole
of
the
old
testament
nor
do
i
think
that
among
eastern
christians
in
general
there
is
one
in
a
thousand
of
those
who
can
read
that
has
ever
taken
that
trouble
they
content
themselves
in
general
with
their
liturgies
and
histories
of
saints
few
of
them
read
the
gospels
though
more
do
so
in
syria
than
in
egypt
the
reading
of
the
whole
of
the
scripture
is
discountenanced
by
the
clergy
the
wealthy
seldom
have
the
inclination
to
prosecute
the
study
of
the
holy
writings
and
no
others
are
able
to
procure
a
manuscript
copy
of
the
bible
or
one
printed
in
the
two
establishments
in
mount
libanus
the
well
meant
endeavours
of
the
bible
society
in
england
to
supply
them
with
printed
copies
of
the
scriptures
in
arabic
if
not
better
directed
than
they
have
hitherto
been
will
produce
very
little
effect
in
these
countries
the
cost
of
such
a
copy
trifling
as
it
may
seem
in
england
is
a
matter
of
importance
to
the
poor
christians
of
the
east
the
society
has
besides
chosen
a
version
which
is
not
current
in
the
east
where
the
roman
translation
alone
is
acknowledged
by
the
clergy
who
easily
make
their
flocks
believe
that
the
scriptures
have
been
interpolated
by
the
protestants
it
would
perhaps
have
been
better
if
the
society
in
the
beginning
at
least
had
furnished
the
eastern
christians
with
cheap
copies
of
the
gospels
and
psalms
only
which
being
the
books
chiefly
in
use
among
them
in
manuscript
would
have
been
not
only
useful
to
them
but
more
approved
of
by
the
directors
of
their
consciences
than
the
entire
scripture
upon
mohammedans
it
is
vain
to
expect
that
the
reading
of
the
present
arabic
version
of
the
bible
should
make
the
slightest
impression
if
any
of
them
were
brought
to
conquer
their
inherent
aversion
to
the
book
they
could
not
read
a
page
in
it
without
being
tired
and
disgusted
with
its
style
in
the
koran
they
possess
the
purest
and
most
elegant
composition
in
their
language
the
rhythmical
prose
of
which
exclusive
of
the
sacred
light
in
which
they
hold
it
is
alone
sufficient
to
make
a
strong
impression
upon
them
the
arabic
of
the
greater
part
of
the
bible
on
the
contrary
and
especially
that
of
the
gospels
is
in
the
very
worst
style
the
books
of
moses
and
the
psalms
are
somewhat
better
grammatical
rules
it
is
true
are
observed
and
chosen
terms
are
sometimes
employed
but
the
phraseology
and
whole
construction
is
generally
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
the
language
and
so
uncouth
harsh
affected
and
full
of
foreign
idioms
that
no
musselman
scholar
would
be
tempted
to
prosecute
the
study
of
it
and
a
few
only
would
thoroughly
understand
it
in
style
and
phraseology
it
differs
from
the
koran
more
than
the
monkish
latin
from
the
orations
of
cicero
i
will
not
take
upon
me
to
declare
how
far
the
roman
and
the
arabic
translation
of
the
old
testament
are
defective
being
unable
to
read
the
original
hebrew
text
but
i
can
affirm
that
they
both
disagree
in
many
instances
from
the
english
translation
the
christians
of
the
east
who
will
seldom
read
any
book
written
by
a
moslem
and
to
whom
an
accurate
knowledge
of
arabic
and
of
the
best
writers
in
that
language
are
consequently
unknown
are
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
style
of
the
roman
version
which
is
in
use
among
them
it
is
for
the
sake
of
perusing
it
that
they
undertake
a
grammatical
study
of
the
arabic
language
and
their
priests
and
learned
men
usually
make
it
the
model
of
their
own
style
they
would
be
unwilling
therefore
to
admit
any
other
translation
and
there
is
not
at
present
either
in
syria
or
in
egypt
any
christian
priest
so
bold
and
so
learned
as
bishop
germanus
ferhat
of
aleppo
who
openly
expressed
his
dislike
of
this
translation
and
had
declared
his
intention
of
altering
it
himself
for
which
and
other
reasons
he
was
branded
with
the
epithet
of
heretic
for
arab
christians
therefore
the
roman
translation
will
not
easily
be
superseded
and
if
mussulmans
are
to
be
tempted
to
study
the
scriptures
they
must
be
clothed
in
more
agreeable
language
than
that
which
has
lately
been
presented
to
them
for
they
are
the
last
people
upon
whom
precepts
conveyed
in
rude
language
will
have
any
effect
in
the
present
state
of
western
asia
however
the
conversion
of
mohammedans
is
very
difficult
i
have
heard
only
of
one
instance
during
the
last
century
and
the
convert
was
immediately
shipped
off
to
europe
on
the
other
hand
should
an
european
power
ever
obtain
a
firm
footing
in
egypt
it
is
probable
that
many
years
would
not
elapse
before
thousands
of
moslems
would
profess
christianity
not
from
the
dictates
of
their
conscience
or
judgment
but
from
views
of
worldly
interest
i
was
cordially
greeted
on
my
return
to
the
convent
by
the
monks
and
the
fatherly
ikonómos
one
of
the
churchmen
i
have
met
with
in
the
east
the
safe
return
of
pilgrims
from
the
holy
mountains
is
always
a
subject
of
gratulation
so
great
is
their
dread
of
the
arabs
i
rested
the
following
day
in
the
convent
where
several
greeks
from
tor
and
suez
had
arrived
being
friends
of
the
monks
they
were
invited
in
the
evening
to
the
private
apartments
of
the
latter
where
they
were
plied
so
bountifully
with
brandy
that
they
all
retired
tipsy
to
bed
several
bedouins
had
acquainted
me
that
a
thundering
noise
wady
owasz
like
repeated
discharges
of
heavy
artillery
is
heard
at
times
in
these
mountains
and
they
all
affirmed
that
it
came
from
om
shomar
the
monks
corroborated
the
story
and
even
positively
asserted
that
they
had
heard
the
sound
about
five
years
ago
describing
it
in
the
same
manner
as
the
bedouins
the
same
noise
had
been
heard
in
more
remote
times
and
the
ikonómos
who
has
lived
here
forty
years
told
me
that
he
remembered
to
have
heard
the
noise
at
four
or
five
separate
periods
i
enquired
whether
any
shock
of
an
earthquake
had
ever
been
felt
on
such
occasions
but
was
answered
in
the
negative
wishing
to
ascertain
the
truth
i
prepared
to
visit
the
mountain
of
om
shomar
as
i
had
lost
much
of
the
confidence
of
the
bedouins
by
writing
upon
the
mountains
and
could
not
intimidate
them
by
shewing
a
passport
from
the
pasha
i
kept
my
intended
journey
secret
and
concerting
matters
with
hamd
and
two
djebalye
i
was
let
down
from
the
window
of
the
convent
a
little
before
midnight
on
the
of
may
and
found
my
guides
well
armed
and
in
readiness
below
we
proceeded
by
wady
sebaye
the
same
road
i
had
come
from
sherm
in
this
wady
tradition
says
the
israelites
gained
the
victory
over
the
amalekites
which
was
obtained
by
the
holding
up
of
the
hands
of
moses
ex
xvii
but
this
battle
was
fought
in
raphidim
where
the
water
gushed
out
from
the
rock
a
situation
which
appears
to
have
been
to
the
westward
of
the
convent
on
the
approach
from
the
gulf
of
suez
i
was
much
disappointed
at
being
able
to
trace
so
very
few
of
the
ancient
hebrew
names
of
the
old
testament
in
the
modern
names
of
the
peninsula
but
it
is
evident
that
with
the
exception
of
sinai
and
a
few
others
they
are
all
of
arabic
derivation
on
a
descent
from
the
summit
of
wady
sebaye
at
an
hour
and
a
half
from
the
convent
we
turned
to
the
right
from
the
road
to
sherm
and
entered
wady
owasz
arabic
in
a
direction
wady
rahaba
i
found
here
a
small
chain
of
white
and
red
hills
in
the
midst
of
granite
the
morning
was
so
very
cold
that
we
were
obliged
to
stop
and
light
a
fire
round
which
we
sat
till
sunrise
my
feet
and
hands
were
absolutely
benumbed
for
neither
gloves
or
stockings
are
in
fashion
among
bedouins
we
continued
in
the
valley
crossing
several
hills
till
at
four
hours
and
a
half
we
reached
wady
rahaba
arabic
in
the
lower
parts
of
which
we
had
passed
a
very
rainy
night
on
the
rahaba
is
one
of
the
principal
valleys
on
this
side
of
the
peninsula
it
is
broad
and
affords
good
pasturage
we
halted
under
a
granite
rock
in
the
middle
of
it
close
by
about
a
dozen
small
buildings
which
are
called
by
the
bedouins
makhsen
magazines
and
which
serve
them
as
a
place
of
deposit
for
their
provision
clothes
money
as
bedouins
are
continually
moving
about
they
find
it
inconvenient
to
carry
with
them
what
they
do
not
constantly
want
they
therefore
leave
whatever
they
have
not
immediate
need
of
in
these
magazines
to
which
they
repair
as
occasion
requires
almost
every
bedouin
in
easy
circumstances
has
one
of
them
i
have
met
with
them
in
several
parts
of
the
mountains
always
in
clusters
of
ten
or
twenty
together
they
are
at
most
ten
feet
high
generally
about
ten
or
twelve
feet
square
constructed
with
loose
stones
covered
with
the
trunks
of
date
trees
and
closed
with
a
wooden
door
and
lock
these
buildings
are
altogether
so
slight
and
the
doors
so
insecure
that
a
stone
would
be
sufficient
to
break
them
open
no
watchmen
are
left
to
guard
them
and
they
are
in
such
solitary
spots
that
they
might
easily
be
plundered
in
the
night
without
the
thief
being
ever
discovered
but
such
is
the
good
faith
of
the
towara
towards
each
other
that
robberies
of
this
kind
are
almost
unheard
of
and
their
sheikh
szaleh
whose
magazine
is
well
known
to
contain
fine
dresses
shawls
and
dollars
considers
his
property
as
safe
there
as
it
would
be
in
the
best
om
shomar
secured
building
in
a
large
town
the
towara
are
well
entitled
to
pride
themselves
on
this
trait
in
their
character
for
i
found
nothing
similar
to
it
among
other
bedouins
the
only
instance
upon
record
of
a
magazine
having
been
plundered
among
them
is
that
mentioned
in
page
for
which
the
own
father
inflicted
the
punishment
of
death
we
continued
our
route
in
a
side
branch
of
the
rababa
till
at
the
end
of
five
hours
and
a
half
we
ascended
a
mountain
and
then
descended
into
a
narrow
valley
or
rather
cleft
between
the
rocks
called
bereika
arabic
the
camel
which
i
rode
not
being
able
to
proceed
farther
on
account
of
the
rocky
road
i
left
it
here
in
charge
of
one
of
the
djebalye
this
part
of
sinai
was
completely
parched
up
no
rain
having
fallen
in
it
during
the
last
winter
from
hence
on
entering
a
narrow
pass
called
wady
zereigye
arabic
we
found
the
ground
moist
there
being
a
small
well
but
almost
dried
up
it
would
have
cost
us
some
time
to
dig
it
up
to
obtain
water
which
no
longer
rose
above
the
surface
though
it
still
maintained
some
verdure
around
it
this
defile
was
thickly
overgrown
with
fennel
three
or
four
feet
high
the
bedouins
eat
the
stalks
raw
and
pretend
that
it
cools
the
blood
farther
down
we
came
to
two
copious
springs
most
picturesquely
situated
among
the
rocks
being
overshaded
by
large
wild
a
great
number
of
which
grow
in
other
parts
of
this
district
we
descended
the
zereigye
by
windings
and
at
the
end
of
eight
hours
reached
its
lowest
extremity
where
it
joins
a
narrow
valley
extending
along
the
foot
of
om
shomar
the
almost
perpendicular
cliffs
of
which
now
stood
before
us
the
country
around
is
the
wildest
i
had
yet
seen
in
these
mountains
the
devastations
of
torrents
are
every
where
visible
the
sides
of
the
mountains
being
rent
by
them
in
numberless
directions
the
surface
of
the
sharp
rocks
is
blackened
by
the
sun
all
vegetation
is
dry
and
withered
and
the
whole
scene
presents
nothing
but
utter
desolation
and
hopeless
barrenness
we
ascended
in
the
valley
of
shomar
winding
round
the
foot
of
the
mountain
for
about
an
hour
till
we
reached
the
well
of
romhan
arabic
at
nine
hours
from
the
convent
where
we
rested
this
is
a
fine
spring
high
grass
grows
in
the
narrow
pass
near
it
with
several
and
a
gigantic
just
above
the
well
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
are
the
ruins
of
a
convent
called
deir
antous
it
was
inhabited
in
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
and
according
to
the
monks
it
was
the
last
convent
abandoned
by
them
i
found
it
mentioned
in
records
of
the
fifteenth
century
in
the
convent
it
was
then
one
of
the
principal
settlements
and
caravans
of
asses
laden
with
corn
and
other
provisions
passed
by
this
place
regularly
from
the
convent
to
tor
for
this
is
the
nearest
road
to
that
harbour
though
it
is
more
difficult
than
the
more
western
route
which
is
now
usually
followed
the
convent
consisted
of
a
small
solid
building
constructed
with
blocks
of
granite
i
was
told
that
date
plantations
are
found
higher
up
in
the
valley
of
romhan
and
that
the
monks
formerly
had
their
gardens
there
of
which
some
of
the
fruit
trees
still
remain
may
this
morning
i
took
hamd
with
me
to
climb
the
om
shomar
while
the
other
man
went
with
his
gun
in
pursuit
of
some
which
he
had
seen
yesterday
at
sunset
upon
the
summit
of
a
neighbouring
mountain
he
was
accompanied
by
another
djebalye
whom
we
had
met
by
chance
i
had
promised
them
a
good
reward
if
they
should
kill
a
goat
for
i
did
not
wish
to
have
them
near
me
when
examining
the
rocks
upon
the
mountain
it
took
me
an
hour
and
a
half
to
reach
the
top
of
shomar
and
i
employed
three
hours
in
visiting
separately
all
the
surrounding
heights
but
i
could
no
where
find
the
slightest
traces
of
a
volcano
or
of
any
volcanic
productions
which
i
have
not
observed
in
any
part
of
the
upper
sinai
om
shomar
consists
of
granite
the
lower
stratum
is
red
that
at
the
top
is
almost
white
so
as
to
appear
from
a
distance
like
chalk
this
arises
from
the
large
proportion
of
white
feldspath
in
it
and
the
smallness
of
the
particles
of
hornblende
and
mica
in
the
middle
of
the
mountain
between
the
granite
rocks
i
found
broad
strata
of
brittle
black
slate
mixed
with
layers
of
quartz
and
feldspath
and
with
micaceous
schistus
the
quartz
includes
thin
strata
of
mica
of
the
most
brilliant
white
colour
which
is
quite
dazzling
in
the
sun
and
forms
a
striking
contrast
with
the
blackened
surface
of
the
slate
and
red
granite
the
mountain
of
om
shomar
rises
to
a
peak
the
highest
summit
of
which
it
is
i
believe
impossible
to
reach
the
sides
being
almost
perpendicular
and
the
rock
so
smooth
as
to
afford
no
hold
to
the
foot
i
halted
at
about
two
hundred
feet
below
it
where
a
beautiful
view
opened
upon
the
sea
of
suez
and
the
neighbourhood
of
tor
which
place
was
distinctly
visible
at
our
feet
extended
the
wide
plain
el
kaa
the
southern
side
of
this
mountain
is
very
abrupt
and
there
is
no
secondary
chain
like
those
on
the
descent
from
sinai
to
the
sea
in
every
other
direction
i
have
already
mentioned
the
low
chain
called
hemam
which
separates
the
kaa
from
the
gulf
of
suez
in
this
chain
about
five
hours
from
tor
northward
is
the
djebel
nakous
or
mountain
of
the
bell
on
its
side
next
the
sea
a
mass
of
very
fine
sand
which
has
collected
there
rushes
down
at
times
and
occasions
a
hollow
sound
of
which
the
bedouins
relate
many
stories
they
compare
it
to
the
ringing
of
bells
and
a
fable
is
repeated
among
them
that
the
bells
belong
to
a
convent
buried
under
the
sands
the
wind
and
weather
are
not
believed
to
have
any
effect
upon
the
sound
bearings
from
om
shomar
tor
the
usual
road
to
tor
from
the
upper

through
the
valley

far
distant
to

of

over

we
took
a
breakfast
after
our
return
to
romhan
and
then
descended
by
the
same
way
we
had
come
in
wady
zereigye
we
heard
the
report
of
a
gun
and
were
soon
after
gratified
by
seeing
our
huntsman
arrive
at
the
place
where
we
had
left
our
camel
with
a
fine
mountain
goat
immediately
on
killing
it
he
had
skinned
it
taken
out
the
entrails
and
then
put
the
carcase
again
into
the
skin
carrying
it
on
his
back
with
the
skin
of
the
legs
tied
across
his
breast
no
butcher
in
europe
can
surpass
a
bedouin
in
skinning
an
animal
quickly
i
have
seen
them
strip
a
camel
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
entrails
are
very
seldom
thrown
away
if
water
is
at
hand
they
are
washed
if
not
they
are
roasted
over
the
fire
without
washing
the
liver
and
lungs
of
all
animals
are
usually
eaten
raw
and
many
of
the
hungry
bystanders
are
seen
swallowing
raw
pieces
of
flesh
after
a
hearty
dinner
we
descended
by
a
different
path
from
that
we
had
ascended
into
the
upper
part
of
wady
rahaba
in
which
we
continued
for
two
or
three
hours
when
we
halted
at
a
well
called
merdoud
arabic
at
a
little
distance
from
several
plantations
of
fruittrees
my
departure
from
the
convent
had
roused
the
suspicions
of
the
bedouins
they
had
learnt
that
i
was
going
to
om
shomar
and
wady
owasz
two
of
them
set
out
this
morning
by
different
routes
in
order
to
intercept
my
return
intending
no
doubt
to
excite
a
quarrel
with
me
respecting
my
visits
to
their
mountains
in
the
hope
of
extorting
money
from
me
we
met
one
of
them
at
this
well
and
he
talked
as
loud
and
was
as
boisterous
as
if
i
had
killed
some
of
his
kindred
or
robbed
his
tent
after
allowing
him
to
vent
his
rage
for
half
an
hour
i
began
to
speak
to
him
in
a
very
lofty
tone
of
my
own
importance
at
cairo
and
of
my
friendship
with
the
pasha
concluding
by
telling
him
that
the
next
time
he
went
to
cairo
i
would
have
his
camel
seized
by
the
soldiers
when
he
found
that
he
could
not
intimidate
me
he
accepted
of
my
invitation
to
be
our
guest
for
the
night
and
went
in
search
of
a
neighbouring
friend
of
his
who
brought
us
an
earthen
pot
in
which
we
cooked
the
goat
may
one
hour
below
merdoud
we
again
fell
in
with
wady
owasz
and
returned
by
the
former
road
to
the
convent
the
monks
were
in
the
greatest
anxiety
about
me
for
the
bedouins
who
had
gone
in
search
of
me
had
sworn
that
they
would
shoot
me
and
had
even
refused
a
small
present
offered
to
them
by
the
ikonómos
to
pacify
them
expecting
no
doubt
to
obtain
much
more
from
myself
but
they
now
returned
and
obliged
him
to
give
them
what
he
had
offered
them
pretending
that
it
was
for
his
sake
only
that
they
had
spared
my
life
nor
would
the
monks
believe
me
when
i
assured
them
that
i
had
been
in
no
danger
on
this
occasion
i
passed
the
following
four
days
in
the
convent
and
in
several
gardens
and
settlements
of
djebalye
at
a
little
distance
from
it
i
took
this
opportunity
to
look
over
some
of
the
records
of
the
convent
which
are
written
in
arabic
and
i
extracted
several
interesting
documents
relative
to
the
state
of
the
bedouins
in
former
times
and
their
affrays
with
the
monks

found
the

ghafeyr
called

i
had
never

met
with
among

i

the
sheikh
of

said
who
is
also
one
of
the
two
principal
sheiks
of
the
towara
and
in
whose
tent
i
had
slept
one
night
in
my
way
to
the
convent
he
begged
me
to
lend
him
twenty
dollars
which
he
promised
to
repay
me
at
cairo
as
he
wished
to
buy
some
sheep
to
be
killed
on
the
following
day
in
honour
of
the
saint
sheikh
szaleh
i
told
him
that
i
never
lent
money
to
any
body
but
would
willingly
have
made
him
a
present
of
the
sum
if
i
had
possessed
it
he
then
said
in
many
words
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
interference
the
bedouins
would
have
waylaid
and
killed
me
in
returning
from
djebel
katerin
i
told
him
that
he
and
his
tribe
would
have
been
responsible
to
the
pasha
of
egypt
for
such
an
act
and
in
short
that
i
never
paid
any
tribute
in
the
dominions
it
ended
by
my
giving
him
a
few
pounds
of
coffeebeans
wrapped
up
in
a
good
handkerchief
a
few
squares
of
soap
and
a
loaf
of
sugar
to
present
to
his
women
and
thus
we
parted
good
friends
in
the
evening
his
brother
came
and
also
received
a
few
trifles
he
had
brought
a
fat

health
of
his
young
wife

who
are
not
permitted
to
enter

convent
address
their
vows
and
prayers
to
him
on
the
outside
just
below
the
chapel
i
was
invited
to
partake
of
the
repast
prepared
by
the
brother
of
sheikh
hassan
and
much
against
the
advice
of
the
monks
i
let
myself
down
the
rope
from
the
window
and
sat
below
for
several
hours
with
the
arabs
i
was
invited
also
to
the
great
feast
of
sheikh
szaleh
in
wady
szaleh
which
was
to
take
place
on
the
morrow
but
as
i
knew
that
szaleh
the
great
chief
of
the
towara
was
to
be
there
and
would
no
doubt
press
me
hardly
by
his
inquiries
why
i
had
come
without
the
firmahn
and
as
the
arabs
were
greatly
exasperated
against
me
for
my
late
excursion
to
om
shomar
in
addition
to
other
causes
of
displeasure
i
thought
it
very
probable
that
i
might
be
insulted
amongst
them
and
i
therefore
determined
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
this
general
assembly
in
wady
szaleh
to
begin
my
journey
to
cairo
by
so
doing
i
should
also
escape
the
disagreeable
necessity
of
having
bedouin
guides
forced
upon
me
i
engaged
hamd
and
his
brother
with
two
camels
and
left
the
convent
before
dawn
on
the
after
having
taken
a
farewell
nakb
el
raha
of
the
monks
and
especially
of
the
worthy
ikonómos
who
presented
me
at
parting
with
a
skin
which
he
had
lately
bought
of
the
bedouins
together
with
several
fine
specimens
of
rock
crystals
and
a
few
small
pieces
of
native
cinnabar
arabic
the
crystals
are
collected
by
the
arabs
in
one
of
the
mountains
not
far
distant
from
the
convent
but
in
which
of
them
i
did
not
learn
i
have
seen
some
six
inches
in
length
and
one
and
a
half
in
breadth
the
greater
part
are
of
a
smoky
colour
with
pyramidal
tops
the
cinnabar
is
said
by
the
bedouins
to
be
found
in
great
quantities
upon
djebel
sheyger
arabic
a
few
hours
to
the
of
wady
osh
the
valley
in
which
i
slept
at
an
arab
encampment
two
nights
before
i
arrived
at
the
convent
from
suez
may
issued
from
the
narrow
valley
in
which
the
convent
stands
into
a
broader
one
or
rather
a
plain
called
el
raha
leaving
on
our
right
the
road
by
which
i
first
reached
the
convent
we
continued
in
el
raha
for
an
hour
and
an
half
when
we
came
to
an
ascent
called
nakb
el
raha
arabic
the
top
of
which
we
reached
in
two
hours
from
the
convent
i
had
chosen
this
route
which
is
the
most
southern
from
the
convent
to
suez
in
order
to
see
wady
feiran
and
to
ascend
from
thence
the
mountain
serbal
which
with
mount
saint
catherine
and
shomar
is
the
highest
peak
in
the
peninsula
i
had
mentioned
my
intention
to
hamd
who
it
appears
communicated
it
this
morning
to
his
brother
for
the
latter
left
us
abruptly
at
nakb
el
raha
saying
that
he
had
forgot
his
gun
giving
his
camel
in
charge
to
hamd
and
promising
to
join
us
lower
down
as
his
tent
was
not
far
distant
instead
however
of
going
home
he
ran
straight
to
the
arabs
assembled
at
sheikh
szaleh
and
acquainted
them
with
my
designs
their
chiefs
immediately
dispatched
a
messenger
to
feiran
to
enjoin
the
people
there
to
prevent
me
from
ascending
serbal
but
wady
solaf
fortunately
i
was
already
on
my
way
to
the
mountain
when
the
messenger
reached
feiran
and
on
my
return
i
had
only
to
encounter
the
clamorous
and
now
fruitless
expostulations
of
the
arabs
at
that
place
we
began
to
descend
from
the
top
of
nakb
el
raha
by
a
narrow
chasm
the
bed
of
a
winter
torrent
direction
by
at
the
end
of
two
hours
and
a
quarter
we
halted
near
a
spring
called
kanaytar
arabic
upon
several
blocks
near
it
i
saw
inscriptions
in
the
same
character
as
those
which
i
had
before
seen
but
they
were
so
much
effaced
as
to
be
no
longer
legible
i
believe
it
was
in
these
parts
that
niebuhr
copied
the
inscriptions
given
in
plate
of
his
voyage
from
the
spring
the
descent
was
steep
in
many
parts
i
found
the
road
paved
which
must
have
been
a
work
of
considerable
labour
and
i
was
told
that
it
had
been
done
in
former
times
at
the
expense
of
the
convent
this
road
is
the
only
one
passable
for
camels
with
the
exception
of
the
defile
in
which
is
the
seat
of
moses
in
the
way
from
the
upper
sinai
towards
suez
at
three
hours
and
three
quarters
from
the
convent
we
reached
the
foot
of
this
mountain
which
is
bordered
by
a
broad
gravelly
valley
this
is
the
boundary
of
the
upper
mountains
of
sinai
on
this
side
they
extended
in
an
almost
perpendicular
range
on
our
right
towards
wady
szaleh
and
on
our
left
in
the
direction
we
now
entered
wady
solaf
arabic
valley
of
wine
coming
from
the
or
which
here
separates
the
upper
sinai
range
from
the
lower
at
five
hours
we
passed
to
our
right
a
wady
coming
from
the
north
called
abou
taleb
arabic
at
the
upper
extremity
of
which
is
the
tomb
of
the
saint
abou
taleb
which
the
bedouins
often
visit
and
where
there
is
an
annual
festival
like
that
of
sheikh
szaleh
but
less
numerously
attended
our
road
continued
through
slightly
descending
sandy
valleys
at
the
end
of
five
hours
and
a
quarter
after
having
passed
several
encampments
without
stopping
we
turned
by
where
a
lateral
valley
branches
off
towards
the
sea
shore
and
communicates
with
the
valley
of
hebran
which
divides
the
upper
sinai
from
the
serbal
chain
wady
hebran
contains
considerable
plantations
and
gardens
and
this
valley
and
wady
feiran
are
the
most
abundant
in
water
of
all
the
wadys
of
the
lower
country
a
route
from
the
convent
to
tor
passes
through
wady
hebran
which
is
longer
than
the
usual
one
but
easier
for
beasts
of
burthen
at
six
hours
and
three
quarters
we
halted
in
wady
solaf
as
i
found
myself
somewhat
feverish
and
in
want
of
repose
we
saw
great
numbers
of
partridges
this
day
they
run
with
astonishing
celerity
along
the
rocky
sides
of
the
mountains
and
as
the
bedouins
do
not
like
to
expend
a
cartridge
upon
so
small
a
bird
they
are
very
bold
when
we
lighted
our
fire
in
the
evening
i
was
startled
by
the
cries
of
hamd
take
care
of
the
venemous
animal
i
then
saw
him
kill
a
reptile
like
a
spider
to
which
the
bedouins
give
the
name
of
abou
hanakein
arabic
or
the
hanak
meaning
in
their
dialect
mouth
it
was
about
four
inches
and
a
half
in
length
of
which
the
body
was
three
inches
it
has
five
long
legs
on
both
sides
covered
like
the
body
with
setae
of
a
light
yellow
colour
the
head
is
long
and
pointed
with
large
black
eyes
the
mouth
is
armed
with
two
pairs
of
fangs
one
above
the
other
recurved
and
extremely
sharp
hamd
told
me
that
it
never
makes
its
appearance
but
at
night
and
is
principally
attracted
by
fire
indeed
i
saw
three
others
during
this
journey
and
always
near
the
evening
fire
the
bedouins
entertain
the
greatest
dread
of
them
they
say
that
their
bite
if
not
always
mortal
produces
a
great
swelling
almost
instant
vomiting
and
the
most
excruciating
pains
i
believe
this
to
be
the
galeode
phalangiste
wady
rymm
at
least
it
exactly
resembles
the
drawing
of
that
animal
given
by
olivier
in
his
travels
pl
may
good
rest
completely
removed
my
feverish
symptoms
fatigue
and
a
check
of
perspiration
often
produce
slight
fevers
in
the
desert
which
i
generally
cured
by
lying
down
near
the
fire
and
drawing
my
mantle
over
my
head
as
the
bedouins
always
do
at
night
the
bedouins
before
they
go
to
rest
usually
undress
themselves
entirely
and
lie
down
quite
naked
upon
a
skin
which
they
carry
for
the
purpose
they
then
cover
themselves
with
every
garment
which
they
happen
to
have
with
them
even
in
the
hottest
season
they
always
cover
the
head
and
face
when
sleeping
not
only
at
night
but
also
during
the
hours
we
continued
in
wady
solaf
which
was
entirely
parched
up
for
an
hour
and
three
quarters
and
passed
to
the
left
a
narrower
valley
called
wady
keyfa
arabic
coming
from
the
serbal
mountains
at
two
hours
we
passed
wady
rymm
arabic
which
also
comes
from
the
same
chain
and
joins
the
solaf
from
thence
we
issued
at
three
hours
into
the
wady
el
sheik
the
great
valley
of
the
western
sinai
which
collects
the
torrents
of
a
great
number
of
smaller
wadys
there
is
not
the
smallest
opening
into
these
mountains
nor
the
slightest
projection
from
them
that
has
not
its
name
but
these
names
are
known
only
to
the
bedouins
who
are
in
the
habit
of
encamping
in
the
neighbourhood
while
the
more
distant
bedouins
are
acquainted
only
with
the
names
of
the
principal
mountains
and
valleys
i
have
already
mentioned
several
times
the
wady
el
sheikh
i
found
it
here
of
the
same
noble
breadth
as
it
is
above
and
in
many
parts
it
was
thickly
overgrown
with
the
tamarisk
or
tarfa
it
is
the
only
valley
in
the
peninsula
where
this
tree
grows
at
present
in
any
great
quantity
though
small
bushes
of
it
are
here
and
there
met
with
in
other
parts
it
is
from
the
tarfa
that
the
manna
is
obtained
and
it
is
very
strange
that
the
fact
should
have
remained
unknown
wady
el
sheikh
in
europe
till
seetzen
mentioned
it
in
a
brief
notice
of
his
tour
to
sinai
published
in
the
mines
de
this
substance
is
called
by
the
bedouins
mann
arabic
and
accurately
resembles
the
description
of
manna
given
in
the
scriptures
in
the
month
of
june
it
drops
from
the
thorns
of
the
tamarisk
upon
the
fallen
twigs
leaves
and
thorns
which
always
cover
the
ground
beneath
that
tree
in
the
natural
state
the
manna
is
collected
before
sunrise
when
it
is
coagulated
but
it
dissolves
as
soon
as
the
sun
shines
upon
it
the
arabs
clean
away
the
leaves
dirt
which
adhere
to
it
boil
it
strain
it
through
a
coarse
piece
of
cloth
and
put
it
into
leathern
skins
in
this
way
they
preserve
it
till
the
following
year
and
use
it
as
they
do
honey
to
pour
over
their
unleavened
bread
or
to
dip
their
bread
into
i
could
not
learn
that
they
ever
make
it
into
cakes
or
loaves
the
manna
is
found
only
in
years
when
copious
rains
have
fallen
sometimes
it
is
not
produced
at
all
as
will
probably
happen
this
year
i
saw
none
of
it
among
the
arabs
but
i
obtained
a
small
piece
of
last
produce
in
the
convent
where
having
been
kept
in
the
cool
shade
and
moderate
temperature
of
that
place
it
had
become
quite
solid
and
formed
a
small
cake
it
became
soft
when
kept
sometime
in
the
hand
if
placed
in
the
sun
for
five
minutes
it
dissolved
but
when
restored
to
a
cool
place
it
became
solid
again
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
the
season
at
which
the
arabs
gather
it
it
never
acquires
that
state
of
hardness
which
will
allow
of
its
being
pounded
as
the
israelites
are
said
to
have
done
in
numbers
xi
its
colour
is
a
dirty
yellow
and
the
piece
which
i
saw
was
still
mixed
with
bits
of
tamarisk
leaves
its
taste
is
agreeable
somewhat
aromatic
and
as
sweet
as
honey
if
eaten
in
any
considerable
quantity
it
is
said
to
be
slightly
purgative
the
quantity
of
manna
collected
at
present
even
in
seasons
when
the
most
copious
rains
fall
is
very
trifling
perhaps
not
amounting
to
more
than
five
or
six
hundred
pounds
it
is
entirely
consumed
among
the
bedouins
who
consider
it
the
greatest
dainty
which
their
country
affords
the
harvest
is
usually
in
june
and
lasts
for
about
six
weeks
sometimes
it
begins
in
may
there
are
only
particular
parts
of
the
wady
sheikh
that
produce
the
tamarisk
but
it
is
also
said
to
grow
in
wady
naszeb
the
fertile
valley
to
the
of
the
convent
on
the
road
from
thence
to
sherm
in
nubia
and
in
every
part
of
arabia
the
tamarisk
is
one
of
the
most
common
trees
on
the
euphrates
on
the
astaboras
in
all
the
valleys
of
the
hedjaz
and
the
bedja
it
grows
in
great
plenty
but
i
never
heard
of
its
producing
manna
except
in
mount
sinai
it
is
true
i
made
no
inquiries
on
the
subject
elsewhere
and
should
not
perhaps
have
learnt
the
fact
here
had
i
not
asked
repeated
questions
respecting
the
manna
with
a
view
to
an
explanation
of
the
scriptures
the
tamarisk
abounds
more
in
juices
than
any
other
tree
of
the
desert
for
it
retains
its
vigour
when
every
vegetable
production
around
it
is
withered
and
never
loses
its
verdure
till
it
dies
it
has
been
remarked
by
niebuhr
who
with
his
accustomed
candour
and
veracity
says
that
during
his
journey
to
sinai
he
forgot
to
enquire
after
the
manna
that
in
mesopotamia
manna
is
produced
by
several
trees
of
the
oak
species
a
similar
fact
was
confirmed
to
me
by
the
son
of
the
turkish
lady
mentioned
in
a
preceding
page
who
had
passed
the
greater
part
of
his
youth
at
erzerum
in
asia
minor
he
told
me
that
at
moush
a
town
three
or
four
days
distant
from
erzerum
a
substance
is
collected
from
the
tree
which
produces
the
galls
exactly
similar
to
the
manna
of
the
peninsula
in
taste
and
consistence
and
that
it
is
used
by
the
inhabitants
instead
of
honey
we
descended
the
wady
el
sheikh
by
upon
several
projecting
rocks
of
the
mountain
i
saw
small
stone
huts
which
hamd
told
me
were
the
work
of
infidels
in
ancient
times
they
were
wady
feiran
probably
the
cells
of
the
hermits
of
sinai
their
construction
is
similar
to
that
of
the
magazines
already
mentioned
but
the
stones
although
uncemented
are
more
carefully
placed
in
the
walls
and
have
thus
resisted
the
force
of
torrents
upon
the
summits
of
three
different
mountains
to
the
right
were
small
ruined
towers
originally
perhaps
chapels
dependant
on
the
episcopal
see
of
feiran
in
descending
the
valley
the
mountains
on
both
sides
approach
so
near
that
a
defile
of
only
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
across
is
left
beyond
this
they
again
diverge
when
a
range
of
the
same
hills
of
tafel
or
yellow
are
seen
which
i
observed
in
the
higher
parts
of
this
wady
at
the
end
of
four
hours
we
entered
the
plantations
of
wady
feiran
arabic
through
a
wood
of
tamarisks
and
halted
at
a
small
belonging
to
my
guide
hamd
wady
feiran
is
a
continuation
of
wady
el
sheikh
and
is
considered
the
finest
valley
in
the
whole
peninsula
from
the
upper
extremity
where
we
alighted
an
uninterrupted
row
of
gardens
and
plantations
extends
downwards
for
four
miles
in
almost
every
garden
is
a
well
by
means
of
which
the
grounds
are
irrigated
the
whole
year
round
exactly
in
the
same
manner
as
those
in
the
hedjaz
above
szafra
and
djedeyde
among
the
are
small
huts
where
reside
the
tebna
arabs
a
branch
of
the
djebalye
who
serve
as
gardeners
to
the
towara
bedouins
especially
to
the
szowaleha
who
are
the
owners
of
the
ground
they
take
of
the
fruit
for
their
labour
the
owners
seldom
visit
the
place
except
in
the
date
harvest
when
the
valley
is
filled
with
people
for
a
month
or
six
weeks
at
that
season
they
erect
huts
of
and
pass
their
time
in
conviviality
receiving
visits
and
treating
their
guests
with
dates
the
best
species
of
these
is
called
djamya
arabic
of
which
the
monks
send
large
boxes
annually
to
constantinople
as
presents
after
having
taken
out
the
stone
of
the
date
and
put
an
almond
in
its
place
the
nebek
rhamnus
lotus
the
fruit
of
which
is
a
favourite
food
of
the
bedouins
grows
also
in
considerable
quantity
at
wady
feiran
they
grind
the
dried
fruit
together
with
the
stone
and
preserve
the
meal
called
by
them
bsyse
arabic
in
leathern
skins
in
the
same
manner
as
the
nubian
bedouins
do
it
is
an
excellent
provision
for
journeying
in
the
desert
for
it
requires
only
the
addition
of
to
make
a
most
nourishing
agreeable
and
refreshing
diet
the
tebna
cultivators
are
very
poor
they
possess
little
or
no
landed
property
and
are
continually
annoyed
by
visits
from
the
bedouins
whom
they
are
under
the
necessity
of
receiving
with
hospitality
their
only
profitable
branch
of
culture
is
tobacco
of
which
they
raise
considerable
quantities
it
is
of
the
same
species
as
that
grown
in
the
mountains
of
arabia
petraea
about
wady
mousa
and
kerek
which
retains
its
green
colour
even
when
dry
it
is
very
strong
and
esteemed
for
this
quality
by
the
towara
bedouins
who
are
all
great
consumers
of
tobacco
and
who
are
chiefly
supplied
with
it
from
wady
feiran
they
either
smoke
it
or
chew
it
mixed
with
natron
or
with
salt
tobacco
has
acquired
here
such
a
currency
in
trade
that
the
tebna
buy
and
sell
minor
articles
among
themselves
by
the
mud
or
measure
of
tobacco
the
other
vegetable
productions
of
the
valley
are
cucumbers
gourds
melons
hemp
for
smoking
onions
a
few
badendjans
and
a
few
carob
trees
as
for
apple
pear
or
apricot
trees
they
grow
only
in
the
elevated
regions
of
the
upper
sinai
where
in
different
spots
are
about
thirty
or
forty
plantations
of
fruit
trees
in
a
very
few
places
wheat
and
barley
are
sown
but
the
crops
are
so
thin
that
they
hardly
repay
the
labour
of
cultivation
although
the
cultivator
has
the
full
produce
without
any
deduction
the
soil
is
every
where
so
stony
that
it
is
impossible
to
make
it
produce
corn
sufficient
for
even
the
smallest
arab
tribe
wady
ertama
the
narrowness
of
the
valley
of
feiran
which
is
not
more
than
an
hundred
paces
across
the
high
mountains
on
each
side
and
the
thick
woods
of
render
the
heat
extremely
oppressive
and
the
unhealthiness
of
the
situation
is
increased
by
the
badness
of
the
water
the
tebna
are
far
from
being
as
robust
and
healthy
as
their
neighbours
and
in
spring
and
summer
dangerous
fevers
reign
here
the
few
among
them
who
have
cattle
live
during
those
seasons
under
tents
in
the
mountains
leaving
a
few
persons
in
care
of
the
trees
as
mount
serbal
forms
a
very
prominent
feature
in
the
topography
of
the
peninsula
i
was
determined
if
possible
to
visit
it
and
hamd
having
never
been
at
the
top
of
it
i
was
under
the
necessity
of
inquiring
for
a
guide
none
of
the
tebna
present
knew
the
road
but
i
found
a
young
man
who
guided
us
to
the
tent
of
a
djebalye
which
was
pitched
in
the
lower
heights
of
serbal
and
who
being
a
great
sportsman
was
known
to
have
often
ascended
the
mountain
leaving
the
servant
with
the
camels
i
set
out
in
the
evening
on
foot
with
hamd
and
the
guide
carrying
nothing
with
us
but
some
in
a
small
skin
together
with
some
meal
and
ground
nebek
enough
to
last
us
for
two
days
we
ascended
wady
el
sheikh
for
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
and
then
turned
to
the
right
up
a
narrow
valley
called
wady
ertama
arabic
in
the
higher
part
of
which
a
few
grow
in
crossing
over
a
steep
ascent
at
its
upper
extremity
i
met
with
several
inscriptions
on
insulated
blocks
consisting
only
of
one
line
in
the
usual
ancient
character
but
i
did
not
copy
them
being
desirous
to
conceal
from
my
new
guide
that
i
was
a
writing
man
as
it
might
have
induced
him
to
dissuade
the
arabs
in
the
mountains
from
accompanying
me
farther
up
on
the
other
side
of
this
ascent
we
fell
in
with
wady
rymm
which
i
have
already
mentioned
and
found
here
mount
serbal
the
ruins
of
a
small
village
the
houses
of
which
were
built
entirely
with
hewn
stone
in
a
very
solid
manner
some
remains
of
the
foundations
of
a
large
edifice
are
traceable
a
little
lower
down
in
the
valley
are
some
date
trees
with
a
well
which
probably
was
the
first
cause
of
building
a
village
in
this
deserted
spot
for
the
whole
country
round
is
a
wilderness
of
rocks
and
the
valley
itself
is
not
like
those
below
flat
and
sandy
but
covered
with
large
stones
which
have
been
washed
down
by
torrents
from
hence
an
ascent
of
half
an
hour
brought
us
to
the
djebalye
arab
who
was
of
the
sattala
tribe
he
had
pitched
here
two
tents
in
one
of
which
lived
his
own
and
in
the
other
his
family
he
spent
the
whole
day
in
hunting
while
the
women
and
younger
children
took
care
of
the
cattle
which
found
good
pasturage
among
the
rocks
it
was
near
sunset
when
we
arrived
and
the
man
was
rather
startled
at
our
visit
though
he
received
us
kindly
and
soon
brought
us
a
plentiful
supper
when
i
asked
him
if
he
would
show
me
the
way
to
the
summit
of
the
serbal
which
was
now
directly
before
us
he
expressed
great
astonishment
and
no
doubt
immediately
conceived
the
notion
that
i
had
come
to
search
for
treasures
which
appears
the
more
probable
to
these
bedouins
as
they
know
that
the
country
was
formerly
inhabited
by
rich
monks
prepossessed
with
this
idea
and
knowing
that
nobody
then
present
was
acquainted
with
the
road
except
himself
he
thought
he
might
demand
a
most
exorbitant
sum
from
me
he
declined
making
any
immediate
bargain
and
said
that
he
would
settle
it
the
next
morning
june
rose
before
daylight
when
the
djebalye
made
coffee
and
then
told
me
that
he
could
not
think
of
accompanying
me
for
less
than
sixty
piastres
as
the
whole
journey
was
to
last
only
till
the
evening
and
i
knew
that
for
one
piastre
any
of
these
bedouins
will
run
about
the
mountains
on
messages
for
a
whole
day
i
offered
him
three
piastres
but
he
was
inflexible
and
replied
that
were
it
not
for
his
friendship
for
hamd
he
would
not
take
less
than
a
hundred
piastres
i
rose
to
eight
piastres
but
on
his
smiling
and
shrugging
up
his
shoulders
at
this
i
rose
and
declared
that
we
would
try
our
luck
alone
we
took
our
guns
and
our
provision
sack
filled
our
water
skin
at
a
neighbouring
well
called
ain
rymm
arabic
and
began
ascending
the
mountain
straight
before
us
i
soon
began
to
wish
that
i
had
come
to
some
terms
with
the
djebalye
we
walked
over
sharp
rocks
without
any
path
till
we
came
to
the
almost
perpendicular
side
of
the
upper
serbal
which
we
ascended
in
a
narrow
difficult
cleft
the
day
grew
excessively
hot
not
a
breath
of
wind
was
stirring
and
it
took
us
four
hours
to
climb
up
to
the
lower
summit
of
the
mountain
where
i
arrived
completely
exhausted
here
is
a
small
plain
with
some
trees
and
the
ruins
of
a
small
stone
reservoir
for
water
on
several
blocks
of
granite
are
inscriptions
but
most
of
them
are
illegible
i
copied
the
two
following
not
included
after
reposing
a
little
i
ascended
the
eastern
peak
which
was
to
our
left
hand
and
reached
its
top
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
after
great
exertions
for
the
rock
is
so
smooth
and
slippery
as
well
as
steep
that
even
barefooted
as
i
was
i
was
obliged
frequently
to
crawl
upon
my
belly
to
avoid
being
precipitated
below
and
had
i
not
casually
met
with
a
few
shrubs
to
grasp
i
should
probably
have
been
obliged
to
abandon
my
attempt
or
have
rolled
down
the
cliff
the
summit
of
the
eastern
peak
consists
of
one
enormous
mass
of
granite
the
smoothness
of
which
is
broken
only
by
a
few
partial
fissures
presenting
an
appearance
not
unlike
the
peaks
of
the
alps
the
sides
of
the
peak
at
a
few
paces
below
its
top
are
formed
of
large
insulated
blocks
twenty
or
thirty
feet
long
which
appeared
as
if
just
suspended
in
the
act
of
rushing
down
the
steep
near
the
top
i
found
steps
regularly
formed
with
large
loose
stones
which
must
have
been
brought
from
below
and
so
judiciously
arranged
along
the
declivity
that
they
have
resisted
the
devastations
of
time
and
may
still
serve
for
ascending
i
was
told
afterwards
that
these
steps
are
the
continuation
of
a
regular
path
from
the
bottom
of
the
mountain
which
is
in
several
parts
cut
through
the
rock
with
great
labour
if
we
had
had
the
guide
we
should
have
ascended
by
this
road
which
turns
along
the
southern
and
eastern
side
of
serbal
the
mountain
has
in
all
five
peaks
the
two
highest
are
that
to
the
east
which
i
ascended
and
another
immediately
west
of
it
these
rise
like
cones
and
are
distinguishable
from
a
great
distance
particularly
on
the
road
to
cairo
the
eastern
peak
which
from
below
looks
as
sharp
as
a
needle
has
a
platform
on
its
summit
of
about
fifty
paces
in
circumference
here
is
a
heap
of
small
loose
stones
about
two
feet
high
forming
a
circle
about
twelve
paces
in
diameter
just
below
the
top
i
found
on
every
granite
block
that
presented
a
smooth
surface
inscriptions
the
far
greater
part
of
which
were
illegible
i
copied
the
three
following
from
different
blocks
the
characters
of
the
first
are
a
foot
long
upon
the
rock
from
which
i
copied
the
third
there
were
a
great
many
others
but
very
few
were
legible
not
included
not
included
not
included
there
are
small
caverns
large
enough
to
shelter
a
few
persons
between
some
of
the
masses
of
stone
on
the
sides
of
these
caverns
are
numerous
inscriptions
similar
to
those
given
above
as
the
eye
is
very
apt
to
be
deceived
with
regard
to
the
relative
heights
of
mountains
i
will
not
give
any
positive
opinion
as
to
that
of
mount
serbal
but
it
appeared
to
me
to
be
higher
than
all
the
peaks
including
mount
catherine
and
very
little
lower
than
djebel
mousa
the
fact
of
so
many
inscriptions
being
found
upon
the
rocks
near
the
summit
of
this
mountain
and
also
in
the
valley
which
leads
from
its
foot
to
feiran
as
will
presently
be
mentioned
together
with
the
existence
of
the
road
leading
up
to
the
peak
afford
strong
reasons
for
presuming
that
the
serbal
was
an
ancient
place
of
devotion
it
will
be
recollected
that
no
inscriptions
are
found
either
on
the
mountain
of
moses
or
on
mount
catherine
and
that
those
which
are
found
in
the
ledja
valley
at
the
foot
of
djebel
katerin
are
not
to
be
traced
above
the
rock
from
which
the
water
is
said
to
have
issued
and
appear
only
to
be
the
work
of
pilgrims
who
visited
that
rock
from
these
circumstances
i
am
persuaded
that
mount
serbal
was
at
one
period
the
chief
place
of
pilgrimage
in
the
peninsula
and
that
it
was
then
considered
the
mountain
where
moses
received
the
tables
of
the
law
though
i
am
equally
convinced
from
a
perusal
of
the
scriptures
that
the
israelites
encamped
in
the
upper
sinai
and
that
either
djebel
mousa
or
mount
catherine
is
the
real
horeb
it
is
not
at
all
impossible
that
the
proximity
of
serbal
to
egypt
may
at
one
period
have
caused
that
mountain
to
be
the
horeb
of
the
pilgrims
and
that
the
establishment
of
the
convent
in
its
present
situation
which
was
probably
chosen
from
motives
of
security
may
have
led
to
the
transferring
of
that
honour
to
djebel
mousa
at
present
neither
the
monks
of
mount
sinai
nor
those
of
cairo
consider
mount
serbal
as
the
scene
of
any
of
the
events
of
sacred
history
nor
have
the
bedouins
any
tradition
among
them
respecting
it
but
it
is
possible
that
if
the
byzantine
writers
were
thoroughly
examined
some
mention
might
be
found
of
this
mountain
which
i
believe
was
never
before
visited
by
any
european
traveller
the
heat
was
so
oppressive
during
the
whole
day
that
i
felt
it
even
on
the
summit
of
the
mountain
the
air
was
motionless
and
a
thin
mist
pervaded
the
whole
atmosphere
as
always
occurs
in
these
climates
when
the
air
is
very
much
heated
i
took
from
the
peak
the
following
bearings
el
morkha
a
well
near
birket
faraoun
on
the
road
from
tor
to
suez
wady
feiran
sarbout
el
djemal
el
djoze
just
over
feiran
mountain
dhellel
wady
akhdar
which
i
passed
on
my
road
from
suez
to
the
convent
wady
el
sheikh
where
it
appears
broadest
and
near
the
place
where
i
had
entered
it
in
coming
from
suez
sheikh
abou
taleb
the
tomb
of
a
saint
mentioned
above
nakb
el
raha
from
whence
the
road
from
the
convent
to
feiran
begins
to
descend
from
the
upper
sinai
mount
catherine
om
shomar
daghade
arabic
a
fertile
valley
in
the
mountains
issuing
into
the
plain
of
kaa
the
direction
of
deir
sigillye
was
pointed
out
to
me
or
this
is
a
ruined
convent
on
the
side
of
serbal
near
the
road
which
leads
up
to
the
summit
of
the
mountain
it
is
said
to
be
well
built
and
spacious
and
there
is
a
copious
well
near
it
it
is
four
or
five
hours
distant
by
the
shortest
road
from
feiran
and
lies
in
a
very
rocky
district
at
present
uninhabited
even
by
bedouins
i
found
great
difficulty
in
descending
if
i
had
had
a
plentiful
supply
of
water
and
any
of
us
had
known
the
road
we
should
have
gone
down
by
the
steps
but
our
water
was
nearly
exhausted
and
in
this
hot
season
even
the
hardy
bedouin
is
afraid
to
trust
to
the
chance
only
of
finding
a
path
or
a
spring
i
was
therefore
obliged
to
return
by
the
same
way
which
i
had
ascended
wady
aleyat
and
by
crawling
rather
than
walking
we
reached
the
lower
platform
of
serbal
just
about
noon
and
reposed
under
the
shade
of
a
rock
here
we
finished
our
stock
of
milk
and
of
water
and
hamd
who
remembered
to
have
heard
once
that
a
well
was
in
this
neighbourhood
went
in
search
of
it
but
returned
after
an
absence
with
the
empty
skin
i
was
afterwards
informed
that
in
a
cleft
of
the
rock
not
far
from
the
stone
tank
which
i
have
already
mentioned
there
is
a
small
source
which
never
dries
up
we
had
yet
a
long
journey
to
make
hamd
therefore
volunteered
to
set
out
before
me
to
fill
the
skin
in
the
valley
below
and
to
meet
me
with
it
at
the
foot
of
the
cleft
by
which
we
had
entered
the
mountain
he
departed
leaping
down
the
mountain
like
a
gazelle
and
after
prolonging
my
siesta
i
leisurely
followed
him
with
the
other
arab
when
we
arrived
at
the
end
of
two
hours
and
a
half
at
the
point
agreed
upon
we
found
hamd
waiting
for
us
with
the
water
which
he
had
brought
from
a
well
at
least
five
miles
distant
a
slight
shower
of
rain
which
had
fallen
instead
of
cooling
the
air
appeared
only
to
have
made
it
hotter
instead
of
pursuing
from
our
second
the
road
by
which
we
had
ascended
in
the
morning
from
ain
rymm
we
took
a
more
western
direction
to
the
left
of
the
former
and
reached
by
a
less
rapid
descent
the
wady
aleyat
arabic
which
leads
to
the
lower
parts
of
wady
feiran
after
a
descent
of
an
hour
we
came
to
a
less
rocky
country
at
the
end
of
an
hour
and
a
half
from
the
foot
of
serbal
where
hamd
had
waited
for
us
we
reached
the
well
situated
among
where
he
had
filled
the
skins
its
water
is
very
good
much
better
than
that
of
feiran
the
are
not
very
thickly
planted
amongst
them
i
saw
several
doum
trees
some
of
which
i
had
already
observed
in
other
parts
of
the
peninsula
this
valley
is
inhabited
by
bedouins
during
the
wady
makta
and
here
are
many
huts
built
of
stones
or
of
which
they
then
occupy
in
the
evening
we
continued
our
route
in
the
valley
aleyat
in
the
direction
to
our
right
was
a
mountain
upon
the
top
of
which
is
the
tomb
of
a
sheikh
held
in
great
veneration
by
the
bedouins
who
frequently
visit
it
and
there
sacrifice
sheep
it
is
called
el
monadja
arabic
the
custom
among
the
bedouins
of
burying
their
saints
upon
the
summits
of
mountains
accords
with
a
similar
practice
of
the
israelites
there
are
very
few
bedouin
tribes
who
have
not
one
or
more
tombs
of
protecting
saints
makam
in
whose
honour
they
offer
sacrifices
the
custom
probably
originated
in
their
ancient
idolatrous
worship
and
was
in
some
measure
retained
by
the
sacrifices
enjoined
by
mohammed
in
the
great
festivals
of
the
islam
in
many
parts
of
this
valley
stand
small
buildings
ten
or
twelve
feet
square
and
five
feet
high
with
very
narrow
entrances
they
are
built
with
loose
stones
but
so
well
put
together
that
the
greater
part
of
them
are
yet
entire
notwithstanding
the
annual
rains
they
are
all
quite
empty
i
at
first
supposed
them
to
be
magazines
belonging
to
the
arabs
but
my
guides
told
me
that
their
countrymen
never
entered
them
because
they
were
kobour
el
kofar
or
tombs
of
infidels
perhaps
of
the
early
christians
of
this
peninsula
i
did
not
however
meet
with
any
similar
structures
in
other
parts
of
the
peninsula
unless
those
already
mentioned
in
the
upper
part
of
wady
feiran
are
of
the
same
class
at
half
an
hour
from
the
spring
and
we
passed
to
our
left
a
valley
coming
from
the
southern
mountains
called
wady
makta
arabic
and
half
an
hour
farther
on
at
sunset
we
reached
wady
feiran
at
the
place
where
the
date
plantations
terminate
and
an
walk
below
the
spot
from
whence
we
set
out
yesterday
upon
this
excursion
wady
aleyat
in
the
course
of
my
descent
from
the
cleft
at
the
foot
of
mount
serbal
through
the
wady
aleyat
i
found
numerous
inscriptions
on
blocks
by
the
side
of
the
road
those
which
i
copied
were
in
the
following
order
some
i
did
not
copy
and
many
were
effaced
upon
a
flat
stone
in
the
upper
extremity
of
the
wady
descending
from
the
foot
of
serbal
towards
the
well
with
not
included
upon
a
small
block
lower
down
not
included
upon
a
small
rock
still
lower
down
not
included
still
descending
not
included
near
the
spring
not
included
upon
a
large
rock
beyond
the
spring
and
towards
wady
feiran
not
included
further
down
upon
a
rock
being
one
of
the
clearest
inscriptions
which
i
saw
not
included
on
many
stones
were
drawings
of
goats
and
camels
this
was
once
probably
the
main
road
to
the
top
of
serbal
which
continued
along
its
foot
and
turned
by
deir
sigillye
round
its
eastern
side
thus
passing
the
cleft
and
the
road
by
which
we
had
ascended
and
which
nowhere
bears
traces
of
having
ever
been
a
regular
and
frequented
route
after
my
departure
in
the
morning
for
mount
serbal
the
messenger
dispatched
by
the
arabs
assembled
in
sheikh
szaleh
arrived
at
wady
feiran
and
forbad
the
people
from
guiding
me
to
the
top
of
serbal
the
news
of
this
order
had
spread
along
the
whole
valley
so
that
on
our
reaching
the
first
habitations
under
the
where
i
intended
to
rest
for
the
night
all
the
arabs
wady
feiran
assembled
and
became
extremely
clamorous
as
well
against
me
as
against
hamd
for
having
accompanied
me
i
cared
but
little
for
their
insolent
language
which
i
knew
how
to
reply
to
but
i
was
under
some
apprehensions
for
my
servant
and
baggage
and
therefore
determined
to
rejoin
them
immediately
we
ascended
the
valley
by
a
gentle
slope
and
reached
garden
late
at
night
greatly
fatigued
for
we
had
been
almost
the
whole
day
upon
our
legs
we
here
met
the
bedouins
and
their
girls
occupied
in
singing
and
dancing
which
they
kept
up
till
near
midnight
june
i
awoke
i
found
about
thirty
arabs
round
me
ready
to
begin
a
new
quarrel
about
my
pursuits
in
their
mountains
when
they
saw
that
i
paid
little
attention
to
their
remonstrances
and
was
packing
up
my
effects
in
order
to
proceed
on
my
journey
they
then
asked
me
for
some
victuals
and
coffee
after
having
observed
to
them
that
i
was
more
easily
prevailed
upon
by
civility
than
harshness
i
distributed
among
the
poorest
such
provisions
as
i
should
not
want
on
my
way
back
to
suez
together
with
some
and
soap
this
immediately
put
them
into
good
humour
and
in
return
they
brought
me
some
milk
cucumbers
and
a
quantity
of
bsyse
or
ground
nebek
i
purchased
from
them
a
skinful
of
dates
reduced
to
a
paste
and
one
of
them
joined
us
for
the
sake
of
travelling
in
our
company
to
suez
where
he
intended
to
sell
a
load
of
charcoal
we
then
set
out
leaving
every
body
behind
us
well
satisfied
we
followed
the
same
road
by
which
we
had
ascended
last
night
and
halted
again
where
the
date
trees
terminate
here
the
same
arabs
whom
we
had
found
yesterday
evening
having
been
informed
that
i
had
made
some
presents
where
i
had
slept
thought
no
doubt
that
by
being
vociferous
they
would
obtain
something
in
this
however
they
were
mistaken
for
i
gave
them
nothing
telling
them
they
might
seize
my
baggage
if
they
chose
but
this
they
prudently
declined
to
do
ten
years
ago
i
should
hardly
have
been
able
to
extricate
myself
in
this
manner
the
valley
of
feiran
widens
considerably
where
it
is
joined
by
the
wady
aleyat
and
is
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
breadth
upon
the
mountains
on
both
sides
of
the
road
stand
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
city
the
houses
are
small
but
built
entirely
of
stones
some
of
which
are
hewn
and
some
united
with
cement
but
the
greater
part
are
piled
up
loosely
i
counted
the
ruins
of
about
two
hundred
houses
there
are
no
traces
of
any
large
edifice
on
the
north
side
but
on
the
southern
mountain
there
is
an
extensive
building
the
lower
part
of
which
is
of
stone
and
the
upper
part
of
earth
it
is
surrounded
by
private
habitations
which
are
all
in
complete
ruins
at
the
foot
of
the
southern
mountain
are
the
remains
of
a
small
aqueduct
upon
several
of
the
neighbouring
hills
are
ruins
of
towers
and
as
we
proceeded
down
the
valley
for
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
i
saw
many
small
grottos
in
the
rocks
on
both
sides
hewn
in
the
rudest
manner
and
without
any
regularity
or
symmetry
the
greater
part
seemed
to
have
been
originally
formed
by
nature
and
afterwards
widened
by
human
labour
some
of
the
largest
which
were
near
the
ruined
city
had
perhaps
once
served
as
habitations
the
others
were
evidently
sepulchres
but
few
of
them
were
large
enough
to
hold
three
corpses
and
they
were
not
more
than
three
or
four
feet
high
i
found
no
traces
of
antiquity
in
any
of
them
at
half
an
hour
from
the
last
of
feiran
i
saw
to
the
right
of
the
road
upon
the
side
of
the
mountain
the
ruins
of
a
small
town
or
village
the
valley
in
the
front
of
which
is
at
present
quite
barren
it
had
been
better
built
than
the
town
above
described
and
contained
one
very
good
building
of
hewn
stone
with
two
stories
each
having
five
oblong
windows
in
front
the
roof
has
fallen
in
the
style
of
architecture
of
the
whole
strongly
resembles
that
seen
in
the
ruins
of
simon
to
the
north
of
aleppo
the
mountains
above
which
are
also
full
of
sepulchral
grottos
like
those
near
feiran
the
roofs
of
the
houses
appear
to
have
been
entirely
of
stone
like
those
in
the
ruined
towns
of
the
haouran
but
flat
and
not
arched
there
were
here
about
a
hundred
ruined
houses
feiran
was
formerly
the
seat
of
a
bishopric
theodosius
was
bishop
during
the
monothelite
controversy
from
documents
of
the
fifteenth
century
still
existing
in
the
convent
of
mount
sinai
there
appears
at
that
time
to
have
been
an
inhabited
convent
at
feiran
makrizi
the
excellent
historian
and
describer
of
egypt
who
wrote
about
the
same
time
gives
the
following
account
of
feiran
which
he
calls
faran
the
present
bedouins
call
it
fyran
or
feiran
arabic
and
thus
it
is
spelt
wherever
it
occurs
in
the
arabic
documents
in
the
convent
niebuhr
calls
it
faran
and
i
have
heard
some
bedouins
pronounce
it
as
if
it
were
written
arabic
giving
it
nearly
the
sound
of
fyran
is
one
of
the
towns
of
the
amalakites
situated
near
the
borders
of
the
sea
of
kolzoum
upon
a
hill
between
two
mountains
on
each
of
which
are
numberless
excavations
full
of
corpses
it
is
one
journey
distant
in
a
straight
line
from
the
sea
of
kolzoum
the
shore
of
which
is
there
called
shore
of
the
sea
of
faran
there
it
was
that
pharaoh
was
drowned
by
the
almighty
between
the
city
of
faran
and
the
tyh
are
two
days
journey
it
is
said
that
faran
is
the
name
of
the
mountains
of
mekka
and
that
it
is
the
name
of
other
mountains
in
the
hedjaz
and
that
it
is
the
place
mentioned
in
the
books
of
moses
but
the
truth
is
that
tor
and
faran
are
two
districts
belonging
to
the
southern
parts
of
egypt
and
that
it
is
not
the
same
as
the
faran
paran
mentioned
in
the
books
of
moses
it
is
stated
that
the
mountains
of
mekka
derive
their
name
from
faran
ibn
amr
ibn
amalyk
some
call
them
the
mountains
of
faran
others
fyran
the
city
of
faran
was
one
of
the
cities
belonging
to
midian
and
remained
so
until
the
present
times
there
are
plenty
of
palmtrees
there
of
the
dates
of
which
i
have
myself
eaten
a
large
river
flows
by
the
town
is
at
present
in
ruins
bedouins
only
pass
makrizi
is
certainly
right
in
supposing
that
the
faran
or
paran
mentioned
in
the
scriptures
is
not
the
same
as
feiran
an
opinion
which
has
been
entertained
also
by
niebuhr
and
other
travellers
from
the
passage
in
numbers
xiii
it
is
evident
that
paran
was
situated
in
the
desert
of
kadesh
which
was
on
the
borders
of
the
country
of
the
edomites
and
which
the
israelites
reached
after
their
departure
from
mount
sinai
on
their
way
towards
the
land
of
edom
paran
must
therefore
be
looked
for
in
the
desert
west
of
wady
mousa
and
the
tomb
of
aaron
which
is
shewn
there
at
present
the
people
of
feiran
bury
their
dead
higher
up
in
the
valley
than
the
ancient
ruins
in
the
neighbourhood
of
sheikh
abou
taleb
there
is
no
rivulet
but
in
winter
time
the
valley
is
completely
flooded
and
a
large
stream
of
water
collected
from
all
the
lateral
valleys
of
wady
el
sheikh
empties
itself
through
wady
feiran
into
the
gulf
of
suez
near
the
birket
faraoun
we
rode
for
one
hour
from
feiran
and
then
stopped
near
some
date
trees
called
hosseye
arabic
where
are
several
arab
huts
and
where
good
water
is
found
here
i
remained
the
rest
of
the
day
as
i
felt
very
much
the
effect
of
exertions
in
the
evening
all
the
females
quitted
the
huts
to
join
in
the
mesámer
in
which
i
also
participated
and
we
kept
it
up
till
long
after
midnight
my
servant
this
was
the
same
man
who
had
accompanied
me
during
my
journey
to
upper
egypt
as
far
as
assouan
i
again
engaged
him
in
my
service
after
my
return
fro
m
the
hedjaz
attempted
to
join
the
party
but
the
proud
wady
romman
arabs
told
him
that
he
was
a
fellah
not
of
good
breed
and
would
not
permit
him
to
mix
in
the
dance
he
met
with
the
same
repulse
last
night
at
feiran
june
followed
the
valley
by
a
slight
slope
through
its
windings
and
many
tamarisk
trees
grow
here
and
some
manna
is
collected
the
fertility
of
these
valleys
is
owing
chiefly
to
the
alluvial
soil
brought
down
from
the
mountains
by
the
torrents
and
which
soon
acquires
consistence
in
the
bottom
of
the
wady
but
if
a
year
passes
without
rain
these
alluvia
are
reduced
to
dust
and
dispersed
by
the
winds
over
the
mountains
from
whence
they
came
the
surface
was
covered
with
a
yellow
clay
in
which
a
variety
of
herbs
was
growing
at
two
hours
the
valley
for
the
length
of
about
an
hour
bears
the
name
of
wady
el
beka
arabic
or
the
valley
of
weeping
from
the
circumstance
as
it
is
related
of
a
bedouin
who
wept
because
his
dromedary
fell
here
during
the
pursuit
of
an
enemy
and
he
was
thus
unable
to
follow
his
companions
who
were
galloping
up
the
valley
to
wards
feiran
the
rock
on
the
side
of
the
road
is
mostly
composed
of
gneiss
at
three
hours
and
a
half
we
passed
to
our
right
wady
romman
arabic
i
was
told
that
in
the
mountains
from
which
it
descends
is
a
fine
spring
and
some
trees
about
four
hours
distant
the
road
now
turned
the
granite
finishes
and
begins
among
the
latter
is
found
at
five
hours
we
halted
under
a
large
impending
sandstone
rock
where
the
valley
widens
considerably
and
continues
in
a
direction
down
to
the
leaving
this
valley
to
the
left
we
rode
in
the
afternoon
ascending
slightly
over
rocky
ground
until
we
reached
an
upper
plain
at
the
end
of
wady
mokatteb
six
hours
the
chain
of
granite
mountains
continued
to
our
right
parallel
with
the
road
which
was
overspread
with
silex
and
farther
on
we
met
with
a
kind
of
basaltic
tufa
forming
low
hills
covered
with
sand
we
then
descended
and
at
six
hours
and
a
half
entered
the
valley
called
wady
mokatteb
arabic
the
appellation
of
djebel
mokatteb
which
several
travellers
have
applied
to
the
neighbouring
mountains
is
not
in
use
to
the
north
of
the
entrance
of
this
valley
near
the
foot
of
the
higher
chain
is
a
cluster
of
magazines
of
the
bedouins
at
a
spot
called
el
bedja
arabic
the
wady
mokatteb
extends
for
three
hours
march
in
the
direction
in
the
upper
part
it
is
three
miles
across
having
to
the
right
high
mountains
and
to
the
left
a
chain
of
lower
sandrocks
half
way
down
it
becomes
narrower
and
then
takes
the
name
of
seyh
szeder
arabic
in
most
places
the
present
abrupt
cliffs
twenty
or
thirty
feet
in
height
large
masses
have
separated
themselves
from
the
cliffs
and
lie
at
their
feet
in
the
valley
these
cliffs
and
rocks
are
thickly
covered
with
inscriptions
which
are
continued
with
intervals
of
a
few
hundred
paces
only
for
at
least
two
hours
and
a
half
similar
inscriptions
are
found
in
the
lower
part
of
the
wady
where
it
narrows
upon
the
rocks
of
the
opposite
or
side
of
the
valley
to
copy
all
these
inscriptions
would
occupy
a
skilful
draughtsman
six
or
eight
days
they
are
all
of
the
same
description
as
those
i
have
already
mentioned
consisting
of
short
lines
written
from
right
to
left
and
with
the
singular
character
represented
in
invariably
at
the
beginning
of
each
some
of
them
are
on
rocks
at
a
height
of
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
which
must
have
required
a
ladder
to
ascend
to
them
they
are
in
general
cut
deeper
than
those
on
the
granite
in
the
upper
country
but
in
the
same
careless
style
amongst
them
are
many
in
greek
containing
probably
like
the
others
the
names
of
those
who
wady
badera
passed
here
on
their
pilgrimage
to
the
holy
mountain
some
of
the
latter
contain
jewish
names
in
greek
characters
there
is
a
vast
number
of
drawings
of
mountain
goats
and
of
camels
the
latter
sometimes
represented
as
loaded
and
with
riders
on
their
backs
crosses
are
also
seen
indicating
that
the
inscribers
were
christians
it
should
be
observed
that
the
mokatteb
lies
in
the
principal
route
to
sinai
and
which
is
much
easier
and
more
frequented
than
the
upper
road
by
naszeb
which
i
took
in
my
way
to
the
convent
the
cliffs
also
are
so
situated
as
to
afford
a
fine
shade
to
travellers
during
the
hours
to
these
circumstances
may
undoubtedly
in
great
measure
be
attributed
the
numerous
inscriptions
found
in
this
valley
we
rested
for
the
night
after
a
march
of
nine
hours
and
a
quarter
near
the
lower
extremity
of
the
seyh
szeder
and
just
beyond
the
last
of
the
inscriptions
the
bottom
of
the
valley
is
here
rocky
and
as
flat
as
if
the
rock
had
been
levelled
by
art
june
a
few
hundred
paces
below
the
place
where
we
had
slept
the
valley
becomes
very
narrow
the
mountains
to
the
right
approach
and
a
defile
of
granite
rocks
is
entered
in
a
direction
by
called
wady
kenna
arabic
where
the
tomb
of
a
saint
of
the
name
of
wawa
arabic
stands
i
was
told
afterwards
at
cairo
by
some
sinai
bedouins
that
lower
down
in
wady
kenna
there
is
a
very
deep
cavern
in
the
rock
at
three
quarters
of
an
hour
we
passed
to
the
right
of
the
defile
and
turned
into
a
valley
called
badera
arabic
the
valley
of
badera
consists
of
sand
rock
and
the
ground
is
deeply
covered
with
sand
we
ascended
gently
in
it
and
in
an
hour
and
three
quarters
reached
its
summit
from
whence
we
descended
by
a
narrow
difficult
path
down
a
cliff
called
nakb
badera
arabic
into
an
open
plain
between
the
mountains
we
crossed
the
plain
and
at
two
hours
and
a
quarter
entered
wady
shellal
arabic
so
called
from
wady
shellal
the
number
of
cataracts
which
are
formed
in
the
rainy
season
by
the
torrents
descending
from
the
mountains
a
great
number
of
acacia
trees
grow
here
many
of
which
were
completely
dried
up
during
the
whole
of
our
journey
not
a
green
herb
could
be
discovered
we
here
met
several
bedouins
on
foot
on
their
way
from
suez
to
feiran
they
had
started
from
the
well
of
morkha
early
in
the
morning
and
had
ventured
on
the
journey
without
water
or
the
hope
of
finding
any
till
the
following
day
in
wady
feiran
we
gave
them
each
a
draught
of
water
and
they
went
off
in
good
spirits
purposing
to
pass
the
afternoon
under
some
shady
rock
and
to
continue
their
journey
during
the
night
we
descended
the
valley
slowly
and
at
the
end
of
four
hours
and
a
half
reached
its
termination
opening
upon
a
sandy
plain
on
the
shore
many
bones
of
camels
were
here
lying
about
as
is
generally
the
case
on
the
great
roads
through
the
desert
i
have
observed
that
these
skeletons
are
found
in
greatest
numbers
where
the
sands
are
deepest
which
arises
from
the
loaded
camels
passing
such
places
with
difficulty
and
often
breaking
down
in
them
it
is
an
erroneous
opinion
that
the
camel
delights
in
sandy
ground
it
is
true
that
he
crosses
it
with
less
difficulty
than
any
other
animal
but
wherever
the
sands
are
deep
the
weight
of
himself
and
his
load
makes
his
feet
sink
into
the
sand
at
every
step
and
he
groans
and
often
sinks
under
his
burthen
it
is
the
hard
gravelly
ground
of
the
desert
which
is
most
agreeable
to
this
animal
on
the
plain
we
fell
in
with
the
great
road
from
tor
to
suez
but
soon
quitted
it
to
the
right
and
turned
to
the
north
in
search
of
a
natural
reservoir
of
rain
in
which
the
bedouins
knew
that
some
water
was
still
remaining
at
the
end
of
five
hours
and
a
half
we
reached
a
narrow
cleft
in
the
mountain
where
we
halted
and
my
guides
went
a
mile
up
in
it
to
fill
the
skins
this
is
called
wady
morkha
el
dhafary
arabic
it
is
sometimes
frequented
by
the
arabs
because
it
furnishes
the
only
sweet
water
between
tor
and
suez
though
it
is
out
of
the
direct
road
and
the
well
of
morkha
is
at
no
great
distance
some
rain
had
fallen
here
in
the
winter
and
water
was
therefore
met
with
in
several
ponds
among
the
rocks
this
is
the
lowest
part
of
the
primitive
chain
of
mountains
and
i
believe
the
only
place
on
the
road
between
tor
and
suez
where
they
approach
the
sea
which
is
only
three
miles
distant
with
a
stony
plain
ascending
from
it
a
slave
of
a
towara
bedouin
here
partook
of
our
breakfast
he
had
been
sent
to
these
mountains
by
his
master
several
weeks
ago
to
collect
wood
and
burn
charcoal
which
he
was
doing
quite
alone
with
no
other
provision
than
a
sack
of
meal
charcoal
commonly
called
fahm
in
arabic
is
by
these
bedouins
called
habesh
a
term
which
i
never
heard
given
to
it
by
any
other
arabs
this
word
may
perhaps
be
the
origin
of
the
name
of
abyssinia
which
may
have
been
called
habesh
by
the
arabs
from
the
colour
of
its
inhabitants
travellers
will
do
well
to
enquire
for
the
dhafary
in
their
way
to
feiran
as
the
water
of
the
morkha
is
of
the
very
worst
kind
this
memorandum
would
be
particularly
useful
to
any
person
intending
to
copy
the
inscriptions
of
wady
mokatteb
we
reached
morkha
arabic
which
bears
from
dhafary
in
half
an
hour
the
road
leading
over
level
but
very
rocky
ground
morkha
is
a
small
pond
in
the
rock
close
to
the
foot
of
the
mountains
two
grow
near
its
margin
the
bad
taste
of
the
water
seems
to
be
owing
partly
to
the
weeds
moss
and
dirt
with
which
the
pond
is
filled
but
chiefly
no
doubt
to
the
saline
nature
of
the
soil
around
it
next
to
ayoun
mousa
in
the
vicinity
of
suez
and
gharendel
it
is
the
principal
station
on
this
road
after
watering
our
camels
which
was
our
only
motive
for
coming
to
the
morkha
we
returned
to
the
bay
of
birket
faraoun
one
hour
distant
we
followed
the
shore
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
in
a
direction
and
then
halted
close
by
the
sea
where
the
maritime
level
is
greatly
contracted
by
a
range
of
chalk
hills
which
in
some
places
approaches
close
to
the
water
before
us
extended
the
large
bay
of
birket
faraoun
so
called
from
being
according
to
arab
and
egyptian
tradition
the
place
where
the
israelites
crossed
the
sea
and
where
the
returning
waves
overwhelmed
pharaoh
and
his
host
there
is
an
almost
continual
motion
of
the
waters
in
this
bay
which
they
say
is
occasioned
by
the
spirits
of
the
drowned
still
moving
in
the
bottom
of
the
sea
but
which
may
also
be
ascribed
to
its
being
exposed
on
three
sides
to
the
sea
and
to
the
sudden
gusts
of
wind
from
the
openings
of
the
valleys
these
circumstances
together
with
its
shoals
render
it
very
dangerous
and
more
ships
have
been
wrecked
in
the
bay
of
birket
faraoun
than
in
any
other
part
of
the
gulf
of
tor
another
proof
in
the
eyes
of
the
arabs
that
spirits
or
demons
dwell
here
this
evening
and
night
we
had
a
violent
simoum
the
air
was
so
hot
that
when
i
faced
the
current
the
sensation
was
like
that
of
sitting
close
to
a
large
fire
the
hot
wind
was
accompanied
at
intervals
with
gusts
of
cooler
air
i
did
not
find
my
respiration
impeded
for
a
moment
during
the
continuance
of
the
hot
blast
the
simoum
is
frequent
on
this
low
coast
but
the
advantage
of
sea
bathing
renders
it
the
less
distressing
june
rode
close
by
the
shore
at
the
foot
of
sandy
cliffs
but
as
the
road
was
passable
only
at
low
water
we
were
obliged
as
the
tide
set
in
to
take
a
circuitous
route
over
the
mountain
at
the
end
of
an
hour
we
again
reached
the
sea
and
then
proceeded
north
over
a
wide
sandy
plain
towards
the
mountain
is
a
tract
of
low
grounds
several
miles
in
breadth
in
which
the
shrubs
gharkad
and
aszef
were
growing
in
great
plenty
at
the
end
of
two
hours
and
a
half
having
reached
a
very
conspicuous
wady
wardan
promontory
of
the
mountain
over
which
lies
the
road
to
the
hammam
mousa
or
of
moses
we
turned
on
its
south
side
into
a
fine
valley
called
wady
el
taybe
arabic
inclosed
by
abrupt
rocks
and
full
of
trees
among
which
were
a
few
of
the
date
now
completely
withered
want
of
rain
is
much
more
frequent
in
the
lower
ranges
of
the
peninsula
than
in
the
upper
at
four
hours
and
a
half
we
passed
wady
shebeyke
reached
soon
afterwards
the
top
of
wady
taybe
and
then
fell
in
with
the
road
by
which
i
had
passed
on
my
way
to
the
convent
from
suez
we
rested
in
wady
thale
under
a
rock
in
the
shade
of
which
at
the
thermometer
rose
to
after
a
march
of
eleven
hours
we
halted
in
wady
gharendel
june
continued
in
the
road
described
at
the
beginning
of
this
journal
and
at
six
hours
and
a
half
reached
wady
wardan
here
we
turned
out
of
the
great
road
to
suez
in
a
more
western
direction
towards
the
sea
in
order
to
take
in
water
at
the
well
of
szoueyra
which
we
came
to
in
three
hours
from
wardan
the
lower
parts
of
wady
wardan
extending
six
or
eight
miles
in
breadth
consist
of
deep
sand
which
a
strong
north
wind
drove
full
in
our
faces
and
caused
such
a
mist
that
we
several
times
went
astray
upon
small
sandy
mounds
in
this
plain
tamarisk
trees
grow
in
great
numbers
and
in
the
midst
of
these
lies
the
well
of
szoueyra
which
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
find
without
a
guide
it
is
about
two
miles
from
the
sea
we
here
met
many
terabein
women
occupied
in
watering
their
camels
i
enquired
of
them
whether
they
ever
collected
manna
from
the
tamarisks
i
understood
from
them
that
in
this
barren
plain
the
trees
never
yield
that
substance
in
the
evening
we
rode
along
a
narrow
path
parallel
with
the
sea
for
two
hours
and
a
half
the
wind
still
continued
and
obliged
us
to
seek
for
shelter
behind
a
desert
of
suez
hillock
in
the
lower
part
of
wady
szeder
where
we
found
protection
against
the
driving
sands
june
the
morning
we
reached
ayoun
mousa
we
found
here
as
we
had
previously
done
in
many
places
near
the
shore
the
tracks
of
carriages
a
very
uncommon
appearance
in
the
east
and
more
particularly
in
deserts
it
was
by
this
road
that
mohammed
women
passed
last
year
from
tor
to
suez
in
their
elegant
vehicles
towards
evening
we
entered
suez
june
caravan
was
to
leave
suez
this
day
but
its
departure
was
delayed
as
i
knew
that
the
plague
had
subsided
at
cairo
and
thought
that
the
road
was
tolerably
safe
i
asked
hamd
whether
he
would
venture
with
me
alone
upon
the
journey
fear
seemed
to
be
quite
unknown
to
this
excellent
young
man
and
he
readily
acquiesced
in
my
proposal
we
left
suez
in
the
evening
with
some
hopes
of
overtaking
a
caravan
of
towaras
which
we
were
informed
had
this
day
passed
to
the
north
of
suez
in
their
way
to
cairo
with
charcoal
towards
sunset
we
came
in
sight
of
the
castle
of
adjeroud
when
hamd
having
descried
from
afar
some
bedouins
on
foot
who
from
the
circumstance
of
their
walking
about
in
different
directions
in
a
place
where
no
road
passed
and
where
bedouins
never
alight
appeared
to
him
to
be
suspicious
characters
we
halted
behind
a
hill
till
it
was
dark
and
took
our
supper
after
sunset
we
saw
several
fires
at
a
distance
in
the
plain
which
hamd
immediately
concluded
to
be
those
of
the
towara
caravan
taking
advantage
of
the
darkness
to
avoid
the
observation
of
the
suspected
persons
we
rode
towards
the
fires
which
instead
of
being
those
of
the
towara
proved
to
belong
to
a
small
party
of
omran
encamped
near
the
well
in
the
wady
emshash
hamd
was
much
alarmed
when
he
perceived
his
mistake
for
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
bad
character
of
the
omran
castle
of
adjeroud
and
he
dreaded
them
the
more
on
account
of
the
arab
of
their
tribe
whom
he
had
killed
near
akaba
they
looked
very
greedily
at
my
travelling
sack
but
as
i
pretended
to
belong
to
the
garrison
at
suez
they
did
not
make
any
attempt
upon
it
they
told
us
that
in
coming
here
they
had
found
five
bedouins
sitting
near
the
well
who
retired
when
they
approached
it
and
who
were
probably
the
men
we
saw
as
we
thought
it
very
likely
that
they
would
waylay
us
farther
on
in
the
narrow
pass
of
montala
we
deemed
it
prudent
to
retire
to
adjeroud
and
take
shelter
in
the
castle
for
the
night
when
we
reached
that
place
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
i
persuaded
the
officer
to
open
the
gates
and
let
us
in
he
was
in
no
less
fear
of
the
robbers
than
ourselves
for
two
days
they
had
driven
back
his
people
from
the
well
of
emshash
where
they
were
accustomed
to
fill
their
water
skins
so
that
the
garrison
was
reduced
to
great
distress
as
they
had
no
provision
of
sweet
water
and
that
of
the
castle
well
is
scarcely
drinkable
a
turkish
officer
with
his
wife
and
son
and
eight
peasants
from
the
sherkieh
formed
the
whole
garrison
and
they
trembled
at
the
name
and
sight
of
the
bedouins
as
much
as
the
monks
of
the
sinai
convent
june
morning
i
proposed
to
the
officer
that
we
should
go
out
in
force
and
drive
the
robbers
from
the
well
which
was
only
half
an
hour
distant
but
this
he
refused
to
do
saying
that
he
had
no
orders
to
leave
the
castle
he
found
it
more
convenient
to
seize
my
skins
which
i
had
filled
at
suez
and
to
make
use
of
their
contents
for
his
family
towards
noon
we
saw
several
of
the
bedouins
hovering
round
the
castle
no
doubt
expecting
us
to
issue
from
it
in
this
difficulty
the
turkish
officer
having
refused
to
lend
his
horse
i
mounted
hamd
in
the
evening
upon
the
strongest
of
the
camels
and
told
him
to
gallop
to
suez
and
acquaint
the
commander
there
with
our
situation
or
else
to
hire
some
of
his
countrymen
who
were
there
waiting
for
the
departure
of
the
caravan
and
in
their
company
to
return
to
our
relief
bringing
with
him
a
supply
of
water
he
set
out
but
had
not
proceeded
a
mile
before
he
saw
the
robbers
running
upon
him
from
different
quarters
and
endeavouring
to
cut
him
off
from
the
road
they
fired
at
him
upon
which
he
returned
their
fire
and
gallopped
back
to
the
castle
the
officer
and
his
valiant
garrison
were
now
thrown
into
the
greatest
consternation
and
could
not
devise
any
means
of
relief
i
offered
to
ride
to
suez
provided
the
officer
would
lend
me
his
horse
but
he
appeared
to
be
more
afraid
of
losing
the
horse
than
of
dying
from
thirst
being
thus
unable
to
effect
any
thing
i
was
under
the
necessity
of
waiting
patiently
till
the
great
caravan
from
suez
should
pass
june
was
now
not
a
drop
of
sweet
water
in
the
castle
and
all
that
we
could
procure
of
the
of
adjeroud
had
been
standing
in
the
tank
since
it
was
filled
from
the
well
at
the
time
of
the
last
pilgrimage
the
wheels
of
the
well
which
is
two
hundred
and

year
the
building
which
encloses
the

shut
up
and
the
person
who
keeps
the
key
was
now
at
cairo
the
water
we
were
thus
obliged
to
drink
was
saline
putrid
and
of
a
yellow
green
colour
so
that
boiling
produced
no
improvement
in
it
and
our
stomachs
could
not
retain
it
june
slight
shower
of
rain
fell
which
the
turk
ascribed
to
his
prayers
but
all
the
water
we
could
collect
in
every
vessel
which
the
castle
could
furnish
scarcely
afforded
to
each
of
us
a
draught
hamd
made
a
second
attempt
to
night
to
go
to
suez
but
it
being
unfortunately
moonlight
he
was
seen
and
again
driven
back
june
three
days
blockade
i
had
the
pleasure
of
descrying
the
suez
caravan
at
a
distance
on
its
way
towards
wady
khouyfera
cairo
we
immediately
got
every
thing
ready
and
when
the
caravan
was
opposite
the
castle
at
about
twenty
minutes
distance
hamd
and
i
hastily
joined
it
what
became
of
the
officer
and
his
garrison
i
never
heard
i
bought
of
the
bedouins
of
the
caravan
a
supply
of
water
sufficient
to
last
me
to
cairo
although
the
passage
of
this
desert
is
less
dangerous
than
formerly
it
is
impossible
to
protect
it
effectually
without
establishing
a
small
body
of
horsemen
or
dromedaries
at
adjeroud
and
it
is
a
discredit
to
the
government
of
egypt
that
this
is
not
done
the
well
of
emshash
affords
a
seasonable
supply
of
water
to
robbers
who
lay
in
wait
in
the
rocky
country
of
montala
where
one
of
them
stationed
on
the
top
of
a
hill
gives
notice
of
the
approach
of
any
enemy
or
object
of
plunder
the
castle
was
undoubtedly
intended
as
a
post
against
the
arabs
the
french
once
had
a
garrison
in
it
and
its
walls
have
been
repaired
by
mohammed
ali
pasha
but
the
interior
is
in
a
very
ruinous
state
and
few
provisions
are
kept
in
the
extensive
within
it
on
proceeding
to
cairo
the
caravan
took
for
the
first
stage
from
adjeroud
a
route
somewhat
to
the
southward
of
that
by
which
i
had
gone
to
sinai
and
joined
the
latter
at
dar
el
hamra
six
hours
and
a
half
from
adjeroud
we
passed
wady
khoeyfera
arabic
the
bed
of
a
torrent
with
trees
growing
in
it
a
very
little
below
the
level
of
the
surrounding
plain
here
i
saw
the
ruins
of
a
small
stone
reservoir
and
to
a
considerable
distance
round
it
ruins
of
walls
and
several
wells
some
built
with
brick
and
others
with
stone
they
appear
to
have
been
surrounded
by
a
wall
which
now
forms
a
circular
enclosure
of
mounds
almost
wholly
covered
with
sands
the
existence
of
these
ruins
which
i
do
not
remember
to
have
seen
mentioned
by
any
traveller
confirms
my
belief
that
in
the
most
ancient
times
regular
stations
cairo
were
established
on
this
road
to
which
we
must
also
attribute
the
date

the
turkmans
who
prfer
living
on

erect
their
tents
on
the
declivities

these

extend
in

direction
above
forty
miles
the
mountain
of
simon

is
in
the

their
average
breadth
including
the
numerous
valleys
which
intersect

may
be
estimated
at
fifteen

twenty

they
lose
themselves
in

fifteen

at
about
seven

this

is
about
the
size
of
the

near
cambridge
it
regularly
but
moderately
overflows
in
and
is
full
of
carps
and
barbles
but
the
turkmans
have
no
implements
of
fishing
besides
the
afrin
there
are
numerous
smaller
rivers
and
sources
which
water
the
valleys
one
of
the
must
considerable
of
these
is
the
river
of
goul
which
takes
its
rise
near
a
turkman
encampment
of
the
same
name
about
six
hours
distant
from
simon
to
the
by
in
a
small
lake
about
one
mile
and
a
half
in
circumference
and
joins
the
waters
of
the
afrin
eight
miles
from
its
source
this
beautiful
little
lake
is
so
full
of
fish
that
the
boys
of
goul
kill
them
by
throwing
stones
at
them
the
river
turns
several
mills
near
goul
and
five
or
six
more
at
six
miles
distance
at
a
place
called
tahoun
kash
near
a
spot
where
the
chieftain
of
the
ryhanlu
mursal
oglu
hayder
aga
has
built
a
house
for
his
winter
residence
and
has
planted
a
garden
on
the
right
bank
of
the
afrin
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
distant
from
it
and
at
three
hours
ride
to
the
of
the
tent
of
mohammed
ali
my
turkman
host
are
two
warm
springs
at
half
an
hour
walk
from
each
other
i
only
saw
the
southernmost
which
is
strongly
impregnated
with
sulphur
and
made
my
thermometer
rise
to
it
constantly
bubbles
from
a
bottom
of
coarse
gravel
in
the
middle
of
the
bason
which
is
about
twenty
feet
in
circumference
and
four
feet
deep
the
sulphureous
smell
begins
to
be
sensible
at
a
distance
of
yards
from
it
and
i
was
told
that
the
northern
spring
was
still
more
sulphureous
the
turkmans
hold
the
medicinal
powers
of
these
springs
as
baths
in
great
estimation
women
as
well
as
men
use
them
for
the
cure
of
violent
headaches
which
are
very
prevalent
amongst
them
the
fields
of
the
turkmans
are
sown
with
wheat
barley
and
several
kinds
of
pulse
their
wheat
was
sown
only
a
fortnight
before
my
arrival
viz
about
the
twentieth
of
february
as
it
is
only
a
short
time
since
they
have
become
agriculturists
they
have
not
yet
any
plantations
of
fruit
trees
although
the
olive
pomegranate
and
fig
would
certainly
prosper
in
their
valleys
thirty
years
ago
the
hills
which
they
now
inhabit
were
partly
covered
with
wood
the
trade
of
firewood
with
aleppo
however
has
entirely
consumed
these
forests
at
present
they
cut
the
wood
for
the
aleppo
market
in
the
mountains
of
the
kurds
on
the
northern
side
of
the
afrin
and
when
that
shall
fail
aleppo
must
depend
for
its
fuel
upon
the
coast
of
caramania
from
whence
egypt
is
now
supplied
the
turkman
hills
are
inhabited
by
vast
numbers
of
jackals
wolves
and
foxes
are
also
numerous
and
i
saw
flocks
of
gazelles
to
the
number
of
twenty
or
thirty
in
each
flock
among
a
great
variety
of
birds
is
the
francoline
which
the
syrian
sportsmen
esteem
the
choicest
of
all
game
in
the
mountains
of
badjazze
which
borders
on
the
turkman
plains
stags
are
sometimes
killed
the
turkmans
are
passionately
fond
of
hawking
they
course
the
game
with
or
if
in
the
plain
they
run
it
down
with
their
horses
the
population
of
the
ryhanlu
turkmans
may
be
roughly
calculated
from
the
number
of
their
tents
which
amount
to
about
three
thousand
every
tent
contains
from
two
or
three
to
fifteen
inmates
they
can
raise
a
military
force
of
two
or
three
thousand
horsemen
and
of
as
many
infantry
they
are
divided
into
thirteen
minor
tribes
the
serigialar
or
tribe
of
the
chief
of
the
ryhanlu
turkmans
hayder
aga
has
five
hundred
horsemen
coudanlut
six
hundred

one

one

fifty
delikanlu
six
hundred
toroun
sixty
bahaderlu
one
hundred
hallalu
sixty
karken
twenty
aoutshar
twenty
okugu
fifty
the
serigialar
derive
their
origin
from
maaden
the
cheuslu
from
the
neighbourhood
of
badjazze
the
babaderli
from
the
mountains
of
simon
the
halalis
from
barak
each
tribe
has
its
own
chief
whose
rank
in
the
divan
is
determined
by
the
strength
his
tribe
hayder
aga
presides
amongst
them
whenever
it
is
found
necessary
to
call
together
a
common
council
his
authority
over
the
ryhanlus
seems
to
be
almost
absolute
as
he
sometimes
carries
his
motions
in
the
divan
even
against
the
opinion
and
will
of
the
assembled
chiefs
he
settles
the
disputes
which
occur
between
these
chiefs
and
which
are
often
accompanied
by
hostile
incursions
into
one
territory
the
chiefs
decide
all
disputes
among
their
own
followers
according
to
the
feeble
knowledge
which
they
possess
of
the
turkish
laws
but
appeals
from
their
tribunal
may
be
made
to
that
of
the
grand
chief
the
whole
ryhanlu
tribe
is
tributary
to
tshapan
oglu
the
powerful
governor
of
the
eastern
part
of
anatolia
who
resides
at
yuzgat
they
pay
him
an
annual
tribute
of
six
thousand
two
hundred
and
fifteen
piastres
in
horses
cattle
he
claims
also
the
right
of
nominating
to
the
vacant
places
of
chieftains
but
his
influence
over
the
turkman
ryhanlu
having
of
late
much
diminished
this
right
is
at
present
merely
nominal
the
predecessors
of
hayder
aga
used
to
receive
their
firmahn
of
nomination
or
rather
of
confirmation
from
the
porte
when
the
tribute
for
tshapan
oglu
is
collected
hayder
aga
generally
gives
in
an
account
of
disbursements
incurred
during
the
preceding
year
for
the
public
service
such
as
presents
to
officers
of
the
porte
passing
through
the
camp
expenses
of
entertaining
strangers
of
rank
the
tribute
as
well
as
hayder
demands
are
levied
from
the
tribes
according
to
the
repartition
of
the
minor
agas
and
each
chief
takes
that
opportunity
of
adding
to
the
sum
to
which
his
tribe
is
assessed
four
or
five
hundred
piastres
which
make
up
his
only
income
as
chief
the
turkmans
do
not
pay
any
miri
or
general
land
tax
to
the
grand
signor
for
the
ground
they
occupy
families
if
disgusted
with
their
chief
often
pass
from
one
tribe
to
another
without
any
one
daring
to
prevent
their
departure
the
ryhanlu
like
most
of
the
larger
turkman
nations
are
a
nomade
people
they
appear
in
their
winter
quarters
in
the
plain
of
antioch
at
the
end
of
september
and
depart
from
thence
towards
the
middle
of
april
when
the
flies
of
the
plain
begin
to
torment
their
horses
and
cattle
they
then
direct
their
march
towards
marash
and
remain
in
the
neighbourhood
of
that
place
about
one
month
from
thence
they
reach
the
mountains
of
gurun
and
albostan
the
mountains
which
they
occupy
are
called
keukduli
sungulu
and
kara
dorouk
upon
kara
dorouk
they
say
are
some
fine
ruins
here
they
pass
the
hottest
summer
months
in
autumn
they
repass
the
plains
of
albostan
and
return
by
the
same
route
towards
antioch
the
winter
habitations
of
the
turkmans
in
the
hilly
districts
are
as
i
have
mentioned
before
erected
on
the
declivity
of
the
hills
so
as
to
be
by
their
position
somewhat
sheltered
from
the
northerly
winds
sometimes
five
or
six
families
live
together
on
one
spot
in
as
many
tents
but
for
the
greater
part
tents
of
single
families
are
met
with
at
one
or
two
miles
distance
from
each
other
in
proportion
to
the
arable
land
which
the
hilly
parts
contain
these
districts
are
better
peopled
than
the
plain
where
a
thousand
tents
are
scattered
over
an
extent
of
the
most
fertile
country
of
at
least
five
hundred
square
miles
the
structure
of
the
habitations
of
these
nomades
is
of
course
extremely
simple
an
oblong
square
wall
of
loose
stones
about
four
feet
high
is
covered
over
with
a
black
cloth
made
of
goats
hair
which
is
supported
by
a
dozen
or
more
posts
so
that
in
the
middle
of
the
tent
the
covering
is
elevated
about
nine
feet
from
the
ground
a
stone
partition
is
built
across
the
tent
near
the
entrance
i
found
in
every
tent
that
the
women
had
uniformly
possession
of
the
greater
half
to
the
left
of
the
door
the
smaller
half
to
the
right
hand
side
is
appropriated
to
the
men
and
there
is
also
a
partition
at
h
figure
not
included
which
generally
serves
as
a
stable
for
a
favourite
horse
of
the
master
or
of
one
of
his
sons
the
rest
of
the
horses
and
the
cattle
are
kept
in
caverns
which
abound
in
these
calcareous
hills
or
in
smaller
huts
built
on
purpose
besides
those
who
live
in
tents
many
of
the
turkmans
especially
in
the
plain
live
in
large
huts
fifteen
feet
high
built
and
distributed
like
the
tents
but
having
instead
of
a
tent
covering
a
roof
of
rushes
which
grow
in
great
abundance
on
the
banks
of
the
afrin
the
room
serves
also
as
the
kitchen
there
they
work
at
their
looms
and
strangers
never
enter
unless
when
as
i
was
told
the
turkmans
meaning
to
do
great
honour
to
a
guest
allow
him
a
corner
of
the
harem
to
sleep
in
quiet
among
the
women
the
apartment
is
covered
with
carpets
which
serve
as
beds
to
strangers
and
to
the
unmarried
members
of
the
family
the
married
people
retire
into
the
harem
the
turkmans
have
also
a
kind
of
portable
tent
made
of
wood
like
a
round
bird
cage
which
they
cover
with
large
carpets
of
white
wool
the
entrance
may
be
shut
up
by
a
small
door
it
is
the
exclusive
habitation
of
the
ladies
and
is
only
met
with
in
families
who
are
possessed
of
large
property
the
tent
or
hut
of
a
turkman
is
always
surrounded
by
three
or
four
others
in
which
the
fellah
families
live
who
cultivate
his
land
these
fellahs
are
the
remaining
peasants
of
abandoned
villages
or
some
poor
straggling
kurds
the
turkmans
find
the
necessary
seed
and
receive
in
return
half
the
produce
which
is
collected
by
a
few
of
them
who
remain
for
this
purpose
in
the
winter
quarters
the
whole
year
round
the
fellahs
live
wretchedly
whenever
they
are
able
to
scrape
together
a
small
pittance
their
masters
take
it
from
them
under
pretence
of
borrowing
it
i
was
treated
by
several
of
them
at
dinner
with
the
best
dish
they
could
afford
bad
oil
with
coarse
bread
they
never
taste
meat
except
when
they
kill
a
cow
or
an
ox
disabled
by
sickness
or
age
the
greater
part
of
them
live
literally
upon
bread
and
water
neither
fruits
or
vegetables
being
cultivated
here
they
are
nevertheless
a
cheerful
people
the
young
men
play
sing
and
dance
every
evening
and
are
infinitely
better
tempered
than
their
haughty
masters
my
host
mohammed
ali
began
a
few
years
ago
to
plant
a
small
garden
of
fruit
trees
near
his
tents
his
example
will
probably
be
generally
followed
because
the
ryhanlu
families
at
every
returning
season
pitch
their
tents
on
the
same
spot
it
is
only
about
ten
years
that
the
ryhanlu
have
cultivated
the
land
like
the
other
turkman
hordes
they
had
always
preferred
the
wandering
life
of
feeders
of
cattle
agriculture
was
introduced
among
them
by
the
persuasion
of
hayder
aga
whose
daughter
having
married
a
chief
of
the
neighbouring
kurds
an
alliance
took
place
which
enabled
the
turkmans
to
perceive
the
advantages
derived
by
the
kurds
from
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
the
principal
riches
of
the
turkmans
however
still
consist
in
cattle
their
horses
are
inferior
to
those
of
the
arabs
of
the
desert
but
are
well
adapted
for
the
mountains
their
necks
are
shorter
and
thicker
than
those
of
the
arab
horses
the
head
larger
the
whole
frame
more
clumsy
the
price
of
a
good
turkman
horse
at
aleppo
is
four
or
five
hundred
piastres
while
twice
that
sum
or
more
is
paid
for
an
arab
horse
of
a
generous
breed
contrary
to
the
practice
of
the
arabs
the
turkmans
ride
males
exclusively
the
family
of
my
host
possessed
four
horses
three
mares
about
five
hundred
sheep
one
hundred
and
fifty
goats
six
cows
and
eight
camels
he
is
looked
upon
as
a
man
in
easy
circumstances
there
are
few
families
whose
property
does
not
amount
to
half
as
much
and
there
are
many
who
have
three
or
four
times
as
many
cattle
i
have
heard
of
some
who
are
possessed
of
property
in
cattle
and
cash
to
the
amount
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
piastres
such
sums
are
gained
by
the
trade
with
aleppo
and
by
usury
amongst
themselves
at
the
time
of
their
departure
for
armenia
the
ryhanlu
buy
up
buffaloes
and
arab
camels
which
they
exchange
in
armenia
for
a
better
breed
of
camels
and
for
some
other
cattle
for
the
aleppo
market
the
armenian
or
caramanian
camel
is
taller
and
stronger
than
the
arab
its
neck
is
more
bent
and
the
neck
and
upper
part
of
the
thighs
are
covered
with
thick
hair
the
arab
camel
on
the
contrary
has
very
little
hair
the
common
load
of
the
latter
is
about
six
hundred
weight
or
one
hundred
and
twenty
rotolos
but
the
armenian
camel
will
carry
one
hundred
and
sixty
rotolos
or
eight
hundred
weight
the
price
of
an
arabian
camel
is
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
piastres
that
of
an
armenian
at
aleppo
is
twice
as
much
this
breed
of
camels
is
produced
by
a
and
a
arabian
camel
the
people
of
anatolia
keep
these
male
dromedaries
as
stallions
for
the
purpose
of
covering
the
females
of
the
smaller
arabian
breed
which
the
turkmans
yearly
bring
to
their
market
if
left
to
breed
among
themselves
the
caramanian
camels
produce
a
puny
race
of
little
value
the
arabs
use
exclusively
their
smaller
breed
of
camels
because
they
endure
heat
thirst
and
fatigue
infinitely
better
than
the
others
which
are
well
suited
to
hilly
districts
the
camels
of
the
turkmans
feed
upon
a
kind
of
low
bramble
called
in
turkish
kufan
which
grows
in
abundance
upon
the
hills
in
the
evening
they
descend
the
mountains
and
come
trotting
towards
the
tents
where
each
camel
receives
a
ball
of
paste
made
of
barley
meal
and
water
weighing
about
one
pound
the
expense
of
feeding
these
useful
animals
is
therefore
reduced
to
the
cost
of
a
handful
of
barley
per
day
the
turkmans
do
not
milk
their
camels
but
use
them
exclusively
as
beasts
of
burthen
through
their
means
they
carry
on
a
very
profitable
trade
with
aleppo
they
provide
the
town
with
firewood
which
they
cut
in
the
mountains
of
the
kurds
distant
about
four
hours
to
the
of
mohammed
tent
the
kurds
themselves
who
inhabit
those
mountains
have
no
camels
and
are
obliged
to
sell
their
wood
and
their
labour
in
cutting
it
at
a
very
trifling
price
besides
wood
the
turkmans
carry
to
town
the
produce
of
their
fields
together
with
sheep
and
lambs
wool
butter
and
cheese
in
the
spring
and
a
variety
of
home
made
carpets
they
transport
the
merchandize
of
the
frank
merchants
at
aleppo
from
alexandretta
to
the
city
the
profits
arising
from
the
trade
with
aleppo
are
almost
entirely
consumed
by
the
demands
of
their
families
for
cloth
coffee
sweetmeats
and
various
articles
of
eastern
luxury
they
seldom
take
back
any
cash
to
their
tents
the
manner
of
living
of
the
turkmans
is
luxurious
for
a
nomade
people
their
tents
are
for
the
greater
part
clean
the
floor
in
the
room
is
furnished
with
a
divan
or
sophas
leaving
only
a
space
in
the
middle
where
a
large
fire
is
continually
kept
up
to
cheer
the
company
and
to
make
coffee
of
which
they
consume
a
great
quantity
their
coffee
cups
are
three
times
the
size
of
those
commonly
used
in
the
levant
or
as
large
as
an
english
coffee
cup
whenever
coffee
is
handed
round
each
cup
is
filled
two
or
three
times
when
i
was
with
them
i
often
drank
twenty
or
more
cups
in
the
course
of
the
day
the
servants
roast
and
pound
the
coffee
immediately
before
it
is
drank
they
pound
it
in
large
wooden
mortars
and
handle
the
pestle
with
so
much
address
that
if
two
or
three
are
pounding
together
they
keep
time
and
made
a
kind
of
music
which
seemed
to
be
very
pleasing
to
their
masters
the
turkmans
taste
flesh
only
upon
extraordinary
occasions
such
as
a
marriage
or
a
circumcision
a
nightly
feast
during
the
ramazan
or
the
arrival
of
strangers
their
usual
fare
is
burgoul
this
dish
is
made
of
wheat
boiled
and
afterwards
dried
in
the
sun
in
sufficient
quantity
for
a
consumption
the
grain
is
with
butter
or
oil
and
affords
a
very
palateable
nourishment
it
is
a
favourite
dish
all
over
syria
besides
burgoul
they
eat
rice
eggs
honey
dried
fruit
and
sour
milk
called
leben
they
have
none
but
goats
milk
their
bread
is
a
thin
unleavened
cake
which
the
women
bake
immediately
before
dinner
upon
a
hot
iron
plate
in
less
than
a
minute
breakfast
is
served
at
eight
in
the
morning
the
principal
meal
takes
place
immediately
after
sunset
the
turkmans
are
great
coxcombs
at
table
in
comparison
with
other
levantines
instead
of
simply
using
his
fingers
the
turkman
twists
his
thin
bread
very
adroitly
into
a
sort
of
spoon
which
he
swallows
together
with
the
morsel
which
he
has
taken
out
of
the
dish
with
it
i
remember
sitting
with
a
dozen
of
them
round
a
bason
of
sour
milk
which
we
dispatched
in
a
few
minutes
without
any
person
except
myself
having
in
the
least
soiled
his
fingers
the
turkman
women
do
not
hide
themselves
even
before
strangers
but
the
girls
seldom
enter
the
room
although
they
are
permitted
freely
to
talk
with
their
guests
i
was
much
struck
with
the
elegance
of
their
shapes
and
the
regularity
of
their
features
their
complexion
is
as
fair
as
that
of
european
women
as
they
advance
in
age
the
sun
browns
them
a
little
as
to
their
morals
chastity
becomes
a
necessary
virtue
where
even
a
kiss
is
punished
with
death
by
the
father
or
brother
of
the
unhappy
offender
i
could
mention
several
instances
of
the
extreme
severity
of
the
turkmans
upon
this
subject
but
one
may
suffice
three
brothers
taking
a
ride
end
passing
through
an
insulated
valley
met
their
sister
receiving
the
innocent
caresses
of
her
lover
by
a
common
impulse
they
all
three
discharged
their
upon
her
and
left
their
fallen
victim
upon
the
ground
while
the
lover
escaped
unhurt
my
host
mohammed
ali
upon
being
informed
of
the
murder
sent
his
servant
to
bring
the
body
to
his
tent
in
order
to
prevent
the
jackals
from
devouring
it
the
women
were
undressing
and
washing
the
body
to
commit
it
to
the
grave
when
a
slight
breathing
convinced
them
that
the
vital
spark
was
not
yet
extinguished
in
short
the
girl
recovered
she
was
no
sooner
out
of
immediate
danger
than
one
of
sons
repaired
to
the
tent
of
his
friends
the
three
brothers
who
sat
sullen
and
silent
round
the
fire
grieving
over
the
loss
of
their
sister
the
young
man
entered
and
saluted
them
and
said
come
to
ask
you
in
the
name
of
my
father
for
the
body
of
your
sister
my
family
wishes
to
bury
he
had
no
sooner
finished
than
the
brothers
rose
crying
she
was
dead
you
would
not
have
asked
for
her
you
would
have
taken
the
body
without
our
then
seizing
their
arms
they
were
hurrying
out
of
the
tent
in
search
of
the
still
living
victim
but
mohammed
son
opposed
the
authority
of
his
father
and
his
own
reputation
of
courage
to
their
brutal
intentions
he
swore
that
he
would
kill
the
first
who
should
leave
the
tent
told
them
that
they
had
already
sufficiently
revenged
the
received
injury
and
that
if
their
sister
was
not
dead
it
was
the
visible
protection
of
the
prophet
that
had
saved
her
and
thus
he
at
last
persuaded
them
to
grant
his
request
the
girl
was
nursed
for
three
months
in
mohammed
family
and
married
after
her
complete
recovery
to
the
young
man
who
had
been
the
cause
of
her
misfortune
notwithstanding
such
severity
the
young
turkmans
boast
of
their
intrigues
and
delight
in
all
the
dangers
of
secret
courtship
and
i
have
been
assured
upon
indisputable
authority
that
there
are
few
men
among
them
who
have
not
enjoyed
the
favours
of
their
mistresses
before
the
consumnnation
of
their
nuptials
if
the
woman
happens
to
become
a
mother
she
destroys
her
illegitimate
offspring
as
the
only
means
of
saving
her
own
life
and
that
of
the
father
the
turkman
ladies
dress
in
the
common
style
of
syrian
women
their
bonnet
is
adorned
with
strings
of
venetian
zequins
or
other
gold
pieces
the
dress
of
the
men
is
that
of
the
turks
of
anatolia
the
horsemen
wear
wide
riding
pantaloons
or
sherwalls
of
cloth
their
consists
of
a
red
cap
round
which
they
twist
a
turban
of
cotton
or
silk
stuff
the
wealthy
wear
turbans
of
flowered
stuffs
or
even
persian
shawls
twenty
years
ago
the
national
was
a
tall
and
narrow
cap
of
white
wool
in
the
shape
of
a
since
that
time
the
ryhanlu
have
left
off
wearing
it
but
i
remember
to
have
seen
a
headdress
of
this
kind
during
my
stay
with
the
turkmans
near
tarsus
the
turkman
women
are
very
laborious
besides
the
care
of
housekeeping
they
work
the
tent
coverings
of
goats
hair
and
the
woollen
carpets
which
are
inferior
only
to
those
of
persian
manufacture
their
looms
are
of
primitive
simplicity
they
do
not
make
use
of
the
shuttle
but
pass
the
woof
with
their
hands
they
seem
to
have
made
great
progress
in
the
art
of
dyeing
their
colours
are
beauitful
indigo
and
cochineal
which
they
purchase
at
aleppo
give
them
their
blue
and
red
dyes
but
the
ingredients
of
all
the
others
especially
of
a
brilliant
green
are
herbs
which
they
gather
in
the
mountains
of
armenia
the
dyeing
process
is
kept
by
them
as
a
national
secret
the
wool
of
their
carpets
is
of
the
ordinary
kind
the
carpets
are
about
seven
feet
long
and
three
broad
and
sell
from
fifteen
to
one
hundred
piastres
a
piece
while
the
females
are
employed
in
these
labours
the
men
pass
their
whole
time
in
indolence
except
at
sunset
when
they
feed
their
horses
and
camels
they
lounge
about
the
whole
day
without
any
useful
employment
and
without
even
refreshing
their
leisure
by
some
trifling
occupation
to
smoke
their
pipes
and
drink
coffee
is
to
them
the
most
agreeable
pastime
they
frequently
visit
each
other
and
collecting
round
the
they
keep
very
late
hours
i
was
told
that
there
are
some
men
amongst
them
who
play
the
tamboura
a
sort
of
guitar
but
i
never
heard
any
of
them
perform
if
the
young
men
would
condescend
to
assist
in
agriculture
the
wealth
of
the
families
would
rapidly
increase
and
the
whole
of
the
plains
of
antioch
might
in
time
be
cultivated
at
present
as
far
as
i
could
observe
there
are
few
families
growing
rich
most
of
them
spend
their
whole
income
a
turkman
never
leaves
his
tent
to
take
a
ride
in
the
neighbourhood
without
being
armed
with
his
gun
pistols
and
sabre
i
was
astonished
to
see
that
they
do
not
take
the
smallest
care
of
their
fire
arms
a
great
number
of
them
were
shewn
to
me
to
know
whether
they
were
of
english
manufacture
i
found
them
covered
with
rust
and
they
complained
of
their
often
missing
fire
they
have
no
gunsmiths
amongst
them
nor
any
artizans
at
all
except
some
farriers
and
a
few
makers
of
bridles
and
of
horse
accoutrements
there
are
no
lawyers
or
ulemas
among
the
ryhanlu
some
families
of
consequence
carry
with
them
a
faqui
or
travelling
imam
to
teach
their
children
to
read
and
to
pray
and
who
in
case
of
need
performs
likewise
the
duties
of
a
menial
servant
much
like
the
young
german
governor
these
faqui
are
for
the
greater
part
natives
of
albostan
educated
there
in
mosques
they
follow
the
turkmans
to
participate
in
the
pious
alms
which
the
koran
prescribes
they
are
generally
ignorant
even
of
the
turkish
law
they
are
often
consulted
however
by
the
chiefs
and
their
sentence
is
generally
confirmed
by
the
chief
whenever
there
is
no
precedent
or
customary
law
in
point
to
the
contrary
i
did
not
see
any
books
amongst
the
turkmans
and
i
am
certain
that
out
of
fifty
hardly
one
knows
how
to
read
or
write
even
few
of
them
know
the
text
of
their
prayers
which
are
throughout
the
mohammedan
countries
in
the
sacred
language
the
arabic
and
therefore
perform
the
prescribed
prostrations
silently
and
without
the
usual
ejaculations
the
married
people
men
as
well
as
women
are
tolerably
exact
in
the
performance
of
their
devotions
but
the
young
men
never
trouble
themselves
about
them
i
did
not
stay
long
enough
among
the
turkmans
to
be
able
to
judge
correctly
of
their
character
especially
as
i
was
ignorant
of
their
language
i
saw
enough
however
to
convince
me
that
they
possess
most
of
the
vices
of
nomade
nations
without
their
good
qualities
the
turkmans
are
like
the
arabs
and
kurds
a
people
of
robbers
that
is
to
say
every
thing
which
they
can
lay
hold
of
in
the
open
country
is
their
lawful
prize
provided
it
does
not
belong
to
their
acknowledged
friends
the
arabs
make
amends
in
some
measure
for
their
robberies
by
the
hospitality
and
liberality
with
which
they
receive
friends
and
strangers
in
this
respect
i
soon
found
that
i
had
been
led
to
form
a
very
erroneous
opinion
of
the
turkman
character
i
was
introduced
at
aleppo
to
mohammed
ali
aga
a
man
of
considerable
influence
amongst
the
ryhanlu
as
a
physician
who
was
travelling
in
search
of
herbs
and
i
succeeded
in
supporting
my
assumed
character
during
near
a
stay
under
his
tent
before
my
departure
from
aleppo
i
made
him
a
present
of
coffee
and
sweetmeats
to
the
amount
of
sixty
piastres
and
i
promised
him
another
present
when
he
should
have
brought
me
back
in
safety
to
aleppo
notwithstanding
these
precautions
my
reception
in
his
tent
was
rather
cool
and
i
soon
found
that
i
was
among
men
who
had
no
other
idea
than
that
of
getting
as
much
out
of
me
as
they
could
they
were
not
under
the
least
restraint
but
calculated
in
my
presence
how
much
my
visit
was
worth
to
them
as
i
sufficiently
understood
from
their
animated
tone
and
gestures
added
to
the
few
turkish
words
which
i
learnt
to
spare
my
dinner
my
host
took
me
out
a
visiting
almost
every
day
just
before
the
dinner
hour
and
that
he
might
know
how
far
it
would
be
prudent
to
incur
expence
on
my
account
he
permitted
one
of
his
friends
to
search
my
pockets
and
was
cruelly
disappointed
when
he
found
that
my
purse
did
not
contain
more
than
four
or
five
piastres
my
horse
for
the
maintenance
of
which
i
had
agreed
with
my
host
was
fed
with
straw
until
i
told
them
that
i
should
take
care
of
it
myself
when
they
were
obliged
to
deliver
its
daily
portion
of
barley
into
my
own
hands
such
was
the
liberality
which
i
experienced
in
return
for
the
medical
advice
and
medicines
which
they
received
without
hesitation
from
me
upon
demanding
them
their
minds
seemed
intent
only
upon
money
except
among
the
lovers
there
was
no
other
subject
of
conversation
and
instead
of
the
arab
virtues
of
honour
frankness
and
hospitality
there
appeared
to
be
no
other
motive
of
action
among
them
than
the
pursuit
of
gain
the
person
of
a
frank
may
be
safe
among
them
but
his
baggage
will
be
exposed
to
close
search
and
whatever
strikes
the
fancy
of
a
powerful
man
will
be
asked
of
him
in
such
a
manner
that
it
is
adviseable
to
give
up
the
object
at
once
i
had
fortunately
hidden
my
compass
in
my
girdle
but
a
thermometer
which
they
found
in
my
pocket
attracted
general
notice
if
i
had
explained
to
them
the
use
i
meant
to
make
of
it
it
would
have
confirmed
the
suspicion
already
hinted
to
me
by
one
of
them
that
i
intended
to
poison
their
springs
i
pretended
that
the
thermometer
was
a
surgical
instrument
which
being
put
into
the
blood
of
an
open
wound
served
to
shew
whether
the
wound
was
dangerous
or
not
it
is
not
more
from
the
behaviour
of
the
turkmans
towards
myself
that
i
formed
my
opinion
of
their
character
than
from
their
conduct
towards
each
other
they
are
constantly
upon
their
guard
against
robbers
and
thieves
of
their
own
tribe
they
cheat
each
other
in
the
most
trifling
affairs
and
like
most
of
the
aleppo
merchants
make
use
of
the
most
awful
oaths
and
imprecations
to
conceal
their
falsehood
if
they
have
one
good
quality
it
is
their
tolerance
in
religious
matters
which
proves
on
the
other
hand
how
little
they
care
about
them
the
men
marry
at
fourteen
or
fifteen
the
girls
at
thirteen
excepting
hayder
aga
and
some
of
his
brothers
there
are
very
few
who
have
more
than
one
wife
they
celebrate
their
marriage
feasts
with
great
pomp
the
young
men
play
upon
those
occasions
at
a
running
game
much
resembling
the
de
barre
known
on
the
continent
of
europe
their
music
then
consists
in
drums
and
trumpets
only
for
the
turkmans
are
not
so
fond
of
music
as
the
aleppines
and
the
arabs
nor
did
i
ever
meet
among
them
with
any
of
the
who
are
so
frequent
amongst
the
arabs
of
the
desert
whenever
a
son
reaches
the
marriageable
age
his
father
gives
him
even
before
his
marriage
a
couple
of
camels
and
a
horse
to
defray
by
the
profits
of
trade
his
private
expenses
at
the
death
of
the
father
his
property
is
divided
amongst
the
family
according
to
the
turkish
law
the
ryhanlu
bury
their
dead
in
the
burying
places
which
are
found
scattered
among
the
ruins
of
deserted
villages
my
observations
were
confined
to
the
ryhanlu
but
they
will
probably
in
great
measure
apply
to
all
the
large
turkman
tribes
which
inhabit
the
western
parts
of
asia
minor
and
concerning
which
i
obtained
a
few
particulars
in
the
level
country
between
badjazze
and
adena
lives
a
tribe
which
is
tributary
to
the
governors
of
these
two
places
they
are
called
jerid
and
are
more
numerous
than
the
ryhanlu
they
likewise
leave
their
plains
towards
the
approach
of
summer
and
winter
in
the
armenian
mountains
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
ryhanlu
like
the
latter
they
have
one
head
and
several
minor
chiefs
and
they
are
divided
into
six
tribes
viz
jerid
chief
shahen
beg
tegir
chief
oglu
kiaya
karegialar
chief
rustam
beg
bozdagan
chief
kerem
oglu
aoutshar
chief
hassan
beg
leck
chief
agri
bayouk
the
lecks
speak
besides
the
turkish
a
language
of
their
own
which
has
no
resemblance
either
to
the
arabic
turkish
persian
or
kurdine
sounds
like
the
whistling
of
birds
said
the
turkman
from
whom
i
obtained
this
information
and
the
same
remark
was
confirmed
by
others
the
name
of
the
leck
renders
the
supposition
probable
that
they
are
descendants
of
the
lazi
a
people
inhabiting
the
coast
of
the
black
sea
and
who
in
the
time
of
the
great
justinian
opposed
his
forces
with
some
success
chardin
mentions
having
met
descendants
of
the
lazi
near
trebizond
whom
he
describes
as
a
rude
people
with
a
peculiar
language
the
pehluvanlu
are
the
most
numerous
tribe
of
the
whole
nation
of
turkmans
they
are
governed
by
a
chief
mahmoud
beg
who
is
tributary
to
tshapan
oglu
a
part
of
them
have
for
a
long
period
been
cultivators
others
are
shepherds
they
inhabit
the
country
from
bosurk
to
near
constantinople
and
pass
the
summer
months
at
one
journey
distance
from
the
ryhanlu
they
are
in
possession
of
a
very
profitable
transport
trade
and
their
camels
form
almost
exclusively
the
caravans
of
smyrna
and
of
the
interior
of
anatolia
they
drive
their
sheep
for
sale
as
far
as
constantinople
the
rishwans
are
more
numerous
than
the
ryhanlu
but
their
tribe
is
not
held
in
esteem
among
the
turkmans
they
were
formerly
tributary
to
rishwan
oglu
governor
of
besna
which
lies
at
one
journey
from
aintab
and
they
used
then
to
winter
in
the
neighbourhood
of
djeboul
on
the
borders
of
a
small
salt
lake
five
hours
to
the
of
aleppo
they
are
at
present
dependent
on
tshapan
oglu
and
winter
in
the
plains
near
haimani
in
anatolia
they
pass
their
summer
months
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
ryhanlu
their
principal
tribes
are
deleyanli
chief
ali
beg
oglu
omar
anli
chief
omar
beg
mandolli
omar
aga
gelikanli
hassan
beg
mor
oglu
the
rishwans
are
noted
even
among
robbers
for
their
want
of
faith
the
great
tribes
of
the
turkmans
are
often
at
war
with
each
other
as
well
as
with
the
kurds
with
whom
they
are
in
contact
in
many
places
these
wars
seldom
cause
the
death
of
more
than
three
or
four
individuals
after
which
peace
is
concluded
in
a
late
war
between
the
ryhanlu
and
the
kurds
which
lasted
five
or
six
months
and
brought
on
several
battles
the
whole
list
of
deaths
was
only
six
kurds
and
four
turkmans
in
the
mountains
the
turkmans
are
accompanied
in
their
military
expeditions
by
foot
soldiers
armed
with
muskets
these
are
men
of
the
tribe
who
can
not
afford
to
keep
a
horse
neither
the
lance
nor
the
bow
is
used
among
them
some
tribes
of
kurds
on
the
contrary
have
never
abandoned
the
use
of
the
bow
the
tar
or
is
observed
among
the
turkman
nations
as
well
among
themselves
as
with
respect
to
foreigners
they
have
a
particular
species
of
tar
which
i
have
never
heard
of
among
the
arabs
it
attaches
to
their
goods
the
following
incident
will
best
explain
it
a
caravan
of
turkman
camels
laden
with
wood
was
seized
last
winter
just
before
the
gates
of
aleppo
by
a
detachment
of
karashukly
a
mixt
tribe
of
turkmans
and
arabs
who
inhabit
the
banks
of
the
euphrates
in
the
vicinity
of
bir
one
of
the
turkmans
was
wounded
the
loads
were
thrown
down
and
fifty
camels
driven
away
worth
about
five
hundred
piastres
apiece
the
turkmans
immediately
dispatched
an
old
arab
woman
as
ambassadress
to
their
enemies
to
treat
for
the
restoration
of
their
camels
and
she
succeeded
in
recovering
them
at
the
rate
of
one
hundred
and
sixty
piastres
apiece
or
eight
thousand
piastres
for
the
whole
i
was
told
by
a
turkman
chief
tar
between
us
will
not
be
for
the
whole
sum
of
thousand
piastres
the
real
value
of
the
camels
but
only
for
the
sum
of
eight
thousand
piastres
for
which
we
shall
on
the
first
opportunity
take
our
there
are
no
sherif
families
or
families
claiming
a
descent
from
the
prophet
amongst
the
ryhanlu
but
family
pride
is
not
unknown
among
them
descendants
from
ancient
and
renowned
chiefs
claim
though
poor
some
deference
from
wealthy
upstarts
in
one
of
their
late
battles
with
the
kurds
a
young
man
of
noble
extraction
but
poor
and
without
authority
was
crying
out
in
the
heat
of
action
let
us
attack
them
on
the
left
hayder
aga
who
heard
it
exclaimed
are
you
hold
your
after
the
victory
the
young
man
was
seen
thoughtful
and
melancholy
in
the
midst
of
the
rejoicings
of
his
brethren
hayder
aga
as
proud
a
man
as
ever
sat
upon
a
throne
to
whom
it
was
reported
sent
for
the
young
man
and
when
he
entered
the
tent
rose
and
kissed
his
beard
begging
him
to
forget
whatever
lie
might
have
said
in
the
heat
of
action
when
he
was
not
always
master
of
himself
their
ideas
of
decency
appear
singular
when
compared
with
our
own
a
turkman
will
talk
before
his
wife
daughter
or
sister
upon
subjects
which
are
banished
from
our
discourse
at
the
same
time
that
he
would
be
much
offended
if
any
friend
should
in
the
presence
of
his
females
speak
in
raptures
or
poetical
terms
of
the
charms
of
a
beloved
mistress
remains
of
antiquity
one
of
the
principal
motives
of
my
visit
to
the
turkmans
was
my
desire
to
visit
some
ruins
near
their
encampments
particularly
those
of
deir
samaan
which
at
aleppo
i
had
heard
compared
to
the
temples
at
baalbec
i
therefore
made
it
a
condition
with
my
turkman
host
that
he
should
take
me
to
deir
samaan
as
well
as
to
several
other
ruins
whose
names
i
had
collected
from
different
aleppines
the
day
after
my
arrival
under
his
tent
he
set
out
with
me
towards
the
deir
and
we
reached
it
after
a
ride
of
four
hours
over
the
rocky
hills
which
encircle
the
mountain
of
simon
called
djebel
samaan
or
sheikh
barekat
the
deir
samaan
consists
of
the
ruins
of
a
church
monastery
or
episcopal
palace
built
upon
the
top
of
an
insulated
hill
bearing
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
of
simon
about
eight
miles
distant
it
is
now
inhabited
by
several
families
of
kurds
who
have
their
black
goat
hair
tents
pitched
in
the
middle
of
the
ruins
they
received
us
with
much
hospitality
a
sheep
was
immediately
killed
and
all
the
delicacies
of
the
season
were
served
up
to
us
after
dinner
and
coffee
tshay
fn
was
served
round
which
the
aleppines
and
all
syrians
esteem
as
one
of
the
greatest
dainties
it
is
a
heating
drink
made
of
ginger
cloves
rosewater
sugar
and
similar
ingredients
boiled
together
to
a
thick
syrup
mursa
aga
the
chief
a
handsome
young
man
then
took
up
his
tamboura
or
guitar
and
the
rest
of
the
evening
passed
in
music
and
singing
the
whole
summit
of
the
hill
which
is
six
hundred
paces
in
length
and
one
hundred
and
seventy
in
breadth
was
once
covered
with
stately
buildings
a
thick
wall
of
square
hewn
stones
is
traceable
all
round
the
principal
ruins
consist
of
two
separate
buildings
a
palace
and
a
church
or
monastery
which
were
separated
from
each
other
by
a
yard
one
hundred
and
ten
paces
in
length
the
palace
or
perhaps
the
high
habitation
is
not
remarkable
either
for
its
size
or
elegance
i
could
not
enter
it
because
it
was
occupied
by
the
harem
of
mursa
aga
a
colonnade
led
from
the
palace
to
the
church
gate
the
broken
fragments
only
of
the
columns
remain
of
the
church
most
of
the
side
walls
are
still
standing
ornamented
with
pillars
and
arches
worked
in
the
walls
it
is
divided
into
two
circular
apartments
of
which
the
inner
may
have
been
the
sanctuary
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
church
is
a
dark
vaulted
room
which
receives
the
daylight
only
from
the
door
and
which
appears
to
have
been
a
sepulchre
a
number
of
niches
if
i
recollect
right
nine
not
perpendicular
like
the
egyptian
sepulchral
niches
but
horizontal
have
been
built
around
the
wall
into
this
chamber
opens
a
subterraneous
passage
which
is
said
by
the
kurds
to
continue
a
long
way
under
ground
in
the
direction
of
antakia
i
could
not
persuade
any
body
to
enter
it
with
me
adjacent
to
this
sepulchre
is
another
vaulted
open
hall
which
has
been
changed
by
its
present
proprietors
into
stables
and
an
apartment
for
receiving
strangers
in
the
heat
of
summer
the
softness
of
the
calcareous
stone
from
the
adjacent
hills
with
which
the
buildings
are
constructed
has
caused
all
the
ornaments
of
the
arches
and
columns
and
even
the
shafts
themselves
to
decay
enough
remains
however
of
their
clumsy
and
overcharged
ornaments
to
shew
that
the
edifices
are
of
an
advanced
period
of
the
greek
empire
the
columns
are
very
small
in
proportion
to
the
arches
which
they
support
and
i
did
not
see
any
above
eighteen
or
twenty
feet
high
the
perishable
nature
of
the
stone
has
not
left
a
single
inscription
visible
if
there
ever
were
any
with
the
exception
of
some
names
of
frenchmen
from
aleppo
who
visited
the
place
eighty
years
ago
the
sign
of
the
cross
is
visible
in
several
places
if
these
buildings
were
constructed
in
pious
commemoration
of
the
devout
sufferings
of
simon
stylites
who
passed
years
of
his
life
upon
a
column
they
are
probably
of
the
sixth
century
simon
died
towards
the
end
of
the
fifth
century
and
in
the
seventh
century
syria
was
conquered
and
converted
to
islamism
by
the
successors
of
mohammed
the
structures
are
certainly
not
of
the
date
of
the
crusades
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
building
are
the
remains
of
an
aqueduct
the
continuation
of
which
is
again
met
with
on
the
opposite
hill
the
kurdine
inhabitants
of
these
ruins
collect
at
present
the
rain
water
in
cisterns
descending
from
the
top
of
the
hill
on
the
western
side
the
remains
of
a
broad
paved
causeway
lead
to
an
arch
which
stands
about
ten
minutes
walk
from
the
castle
and
faces
the
ruins
of
a
city
built
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
of
which
a
number
of
buildings
are
still
extant
these
ruins
called
bokatur
are
uninhabited
their
circumference
may
be
estimated
at
about
one
mile
and
a
half
amongst
the
many
private
houses
a
palace
may
be
distinguished
surrounded
by
a
low
portico
at
which
terminates
the
causeway
leading
from
the
arch
at
half
an
distance
to
the
of
bokatur
are
ruins
resembling
the
former
in
extent
and
structure
i
saw
several
houses
of
which
the
front
was
supported
by
columns
of
a
smaller
size
than
those
of
the
palace
at
bokatur
this
place
is
now
called
immature
at
three
quarters
of
an
hour
to
the
of
it
are
other
similar
ruins
of
a
town
called
filtire
which
i
did
not
see
the
two
latter
places
are
now
inhabited
by
some
poor
kurdine
families
the
style
of
building
which
i
observed
in
the
houses
of
these
ruined
cities
approaches
more
to
the
european
than
the
asiatic
taste
the
roofs
are
somewhat
inclined
and
the
windows
numerous
and
large
instead
of
being

in
turkish
houses
the

most
of
which
are
still
remaining
are
for
the
greatest
part
without
ornament
from
one
foot
to
about
one
foot
and
a
half
thick
and
built
of
calcareous
squared
stones
like
deir

the
pillars
which
are
still
to
be
seen
in
some
of
the
ruined
buildings
are
none
of
them
more
than
fifteen
feet
high
their
capitals
like
those
of
the
columns
in
the
deir
samaan
are
rude
and
unfinished
if
any
order
is
discernible
it
is
a
corrupted
corinthian
the
neighbourbood
of
these
towns
at
least
for
five
miles
round
presents
nothing
but
an
uneven
plain
thickly
covered
with
barren
rocks
which
rise
to
the
height
of
two
or
three
feet
above
the
surface
a
few
herbs
grow
in
the
fissures
of
the
rocks
which
are
scarcely
sufficient
to
keep
from
starving
half
a
dozen
horses
the

of
the

miserable
inhabitants
there
are
several
wells
of
good
water
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
ruins
to
the
of
the
deir
at
an
hour
and
a
distance
stands
a
single
pillar
about
feet
high
the

and
capital
of
which
are
like
those
of

deir
no

are
visible
at
a
few
yards
from
the
column
is
the
entrance
to
a
spacious
subterraneous
cavern
i
passed
this
spot
on
my
way
to
the
deir
and
purposed
to
examine
the
contents
of
the
cave
on
our
return
i
returned
however
by
another
route
we
left
our
friendly
kurds
on
the
following
day
at
noon
at
taking
my
leave
i
told
the
chief
that
i
should
be
happy
to
make
him
some
acknowledgments
for
the
hospitality
shewn
to
me
whenever
he
should
visit
aleppo
he
excused
himself
for
not
having
been
able
to
treat
us
according
to
his
wishes
and
begged
me
to
send
him
from
aleppo
a
few
strings
for
his
guitar
which
i
gladly
promised
these
kurds
have
been
for
some
time
past
at
war
with
the
janissaries
at
aleppo
which
prevents
them
from
going
there
on
our
road
back
to
mohammed
tents
through
bokatur
and
immature
we
met
halfway
a
poor
gypsy
or
as
they
are
called
here
kurpadh
these
kurpadh
are
spread
over
the
whole
of
anatolia
and
syria
the
kurds
have
spread
themselves
over
some
parts
of
the
plain
which
the
afrin
waters
as
well
as
some
of
the
neighbouring
mountains
they
live
in
tents
and
in
villages
are
stationary
and
are
all
occupied
in
agriculture
and
the
rearing
of
cattle
they
form
four
tribes
of
which
the
shum
who
live
in
the
plain
are
the
most
considerable
the
kurds
seem
to
be
of
a
more
lively
disposition
than
the
turkmans
the
aleppines
say
that
their
word
is
less
to
be
depended
upon
than
that
of
the
turkmans
my
hosts
at
deir
samaan
asked
me
many
questions
relative
to
european
politics
i
found
the
opinion
prevalent
among
them
which
buonaparte
has
taken
such
pains
to
impress
upon
the
winds
of
the
continental
nations
that
great
britain
is
and
ought
to
be
merely
a
maritime
power
this
belief
however
proves
very
advantageous
to
english
travellers
in
these
countries
a
frenchman
will
every
where
be
taken
for
a
spy
as
long
as
the
french
invasion
of
egypt
and
syria
is
in
the
memory
of
man
but
it
seems
never
to
enter
into
the
suspicions
of
these
people
that
the
english
can
have
any
wish
to
possess
the
countries
of
the
levant
i
was
astonished
to
find
that
all
the
kurds
spoke
arabic
fluently
besides
the
turkish
and
their
own
language
which
latter
is
a
corrupted
mixture
of
persian
armenian
and
turkish
on
the
other
hand
i
only
met
three
or
four
turkmans
who
knew
how
to
express
themselves
in
arabic
though
both
nations
are
alike
in
almost
continual
intercourse
with
arab
peasants
and
aleppines
besides
the
ruins
just
described
there
are
many
others
dispersed
over
the
turkman
territories
which
to
judge
from
the
prevailing
architecture
are
of
the
same
date
as
those
already
mentioned
tisin

and
mayshat
all
of

at
two
or
three

are
heaps
of
ruined

with
a

kalaa

a
square

about
sixty
feet
high
they
have
only
one
small

near

the

tradition
says
that
kalaa
el
bent
or
in
turkish
kislar
kalassi
the
castle
of
girls
was
formerly
a
convent
probably
of
nuns
at
mayshat
a
turkman
encampment
on
the
top
of
a
hill
at
the
foot
of
which
is
a
large
deep
well
with
a
solid
wall
i
was
shewn
a
subterraneous
chamber
about
twenty
feet
long
and
fifteen
in
breadth
hewn
out
of
the
rock
at
the
entrance
to
which
are
two
columns
there
are
two
excavations
in
the
bottom
of
it
like
the
sepulchral
niches
which
i
saw
in
the
deir
samaan
i
have
been
told
that
near
telekberoun
a
village
situated
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
which
encircle
the
plain
of
khalaka
there
are
remains
of
an
ancient
causeway
elevated
two
or
three
feet
from
the
ground
about
fifteen
feet
broad
running
in
the
direction
from
aleppo
to
antioch
it
may
be
traced
for
the
length
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
the
plain
of
the
afrin
about
three
miles
from
mursal
residence
and
half
an
hour
from
the
afrin
stands
an
insulated
hillock
in
the
plain
with
the
ruins
of
a
saracen
castle
called
daoud
pasha
four
miles
to
the
of
it
is
situated
another
similar
hillock
with
ruins
of
a
castle
called
tshyie
the
sight
of
these
numerous
ruins
fills
the
minds
of
the
turkmans
and
kurds
with
ideas
of
hidden
treasures
and
they
relate
a
variety
of
traditionary
tales
of
moggrebyn
sheikhs
who
have
been
once
on
the
point
of
getting
out
the
treasure
when
they
have
been
interrupted
by
the
shrieks
of
a
woman
having
provided
myself
at
aleppo
with
a
small
hammer
to
break
off
spesimens
of
rocks
the
turkmans
could
not
be
pursuaded
that
this
instrument
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
searching
for
gold
several
turkmans
pressed
me
to
do
them
the
favour
of
working
for
a
day
in
their
behalf
i
endeavoured
to
persuade
them
that
the
hammer
was
to
assist
me
in
procuring
medicinal
herbs

the
chinese
word
for

our

not

the

such
is
the
nominal
division
of

but
the
power
of
the
porte
in
this
country
has
been
so
much
upon
the
decline
particularly
since
the
time
of
djezzar
pasha
of
akka
that
a
number
of
petty
independent
chiefs
have
sprung
up
who
defy
their

have
their
own
chiefs
and
it
was
but
last
year
that
the
pasha
of
damascus
succeeded
in
subduing
berber
a
formidable
rebel
who
had
fixed
his
seat
at
tripoli
and
had
maintained
himself
there
for
the
last
six
years
the
pashas
themselves
follow
the
same
practice
it
is
true
that
neither
the
pasha
of
damascus
nor
that
of
akka
has
yet
dared
openly
to
erect
the
standard
of
rebellion
they
enjoy
all
the
benefits
of
the
protection
of
the
supreme
government
but
depend
much
more
upon
their
own
strength
than
on
the
caprice
of
the
sultan
or
on
their
intrigues
in
the
seraglio
for
the
continuance
of
their
power
the
policy
of
the
porte
is
to
flatter
and
load
with
honours
those
whom
she
can
not
ruin
and
to
wait
for
some
lucky
accident
by
which
she
may
regain
her
power
but
above
all
to
avoid
a
formal
rupture
which
would
only
serve
to
expose
her
own
weakness
and
to
familiarize
the
pashas
and
their
subjects
with
the
ideas
of
rebellion
the
pashas
of
damascus
and
of
akka
continue
to
be
dutiful
subjects
of
the
grand
signior
in
appearance
and
they
even
send
considerable
sums
of
money
to
constantinople

ensure

of

as
well
as
all
strangers
passing
through
his
mountains
and
with
a
force
of
less
than
two
hundred
men
and
a
territory
confined
to
the
half
ruined
town
of
badjazze
in
the
gulf
of
alexandretta
and
a
few
miles
of
the
surrounding
mountains
his
father
and
himself
have
for
the
last
thirty
years
defied
all
the
attempts
of
the
neighbouring
pashas
to
subdue
them
the
inhabitants
of
aleppo
have
been
for
several
years
past
divided
into
two
parties
the
sherifs
the
real
or
pretended
descendants
of
the
prophet
and
the
janissaries
the
former
distinguish
themselves
by
twisting
a
green
turban
round
a
small
red
cap
the
latter
wear
high
barbary
caps
with
a
turban
of
shawl
or
white
muslin
and
a
khandjar
or
long
crooked
knife
in
their
girdles
there
are
few
turks
in
the
city
who
have
been
able
to
keep
aloof
from
both
parties
the
sherifs
first
showed
their
strength
about
forty
years
ago
during
a
tumult
excited
by
their
chiefs
in
consequence
of
a
supposed
insult
received
by
clarke
the
then
british
consul
aleppo
was
governed
by
them
in
a
disorderly
manner
for
several
years
without
a
pasha
until
the
bey
of
alexandretta
being
appointed
to
the
pashalik
surprised
the
town
and
ordered
all
the
chief
sherifs
to
be
strangled
the
pasha
however
found
his
authority
greatly
limited
by
the
influence
which
tshelebi
effendi
an
independent
aleppine
grandee
had
gained
over
his
countrymen
the
immense
property
of
family
added
to
his
personal
qualities
rendered
his
influence
and
power
so
great
that
during
twenty
years
he
obliged
several
pashas
who
would
not
yield
to
his
counsels
and
designs
to
quit
the
town
he
never
would
accept
of
the
repeated
offers
made
by
the
porte
to
raise
him
to
the
pashalik
his
interests
were
in
some
measure
supported
by
the
corps
of
janissaries
who
in
aleppo
as
in
other
turkish
towns
constitute
the
regular
military
force
of
the
porte
but
until
that
period
their
chiefs
had
been
without
the
smallest
weight
in
the
management
of
public
affairs
one
of
household
officers
ibrahim
beg
had
meanwhile
been
promoted
through
the
friends
of
his
patron
at
constantinople
to
the
first
dignities
in
the
town
he
was
made
mutsellim
vice
governor
and
mohassel
chief
custom
house
officer
and
after
the
death
of
tshelebi
his
power
devolved
upon
ibrahim
this
was
in
kussa
pasha
a
man
of
probity
and
talents
was
sent
at
that
time
as
pasha
to
aleppo
being
naturally
jealous
of
ibrahim
influence
he
endeavoured
to
get
possession
of
his
person
by
ordering
him
to
be
detained
during
a
visit
made
by
ibrahim
to
compliment
the
pasha
upon
his
arrival
for
a
debt
which
ibrahim
owed
to
a
foreign
merchant
who
had
preferred
his
complaints
to
the
tribunal
ibrahim
paid
the
debt
and
was
no
sooner
out
of
the
immediate
reach
than
he
engaged
ahmed
aga
one
of
the
present
janissary
chiefs
to
enter
with
him
into
a
formal
league
against
kussa
the
janissaries
together
with
party
attacked
the
troops
who
after
several
days
fighting
were
driven
out
of
the
town
and
ibrahim
was
soon
afterwards
named
pasha
of
three
tails
and
for
the
first
time
pasha
of
aleppo
from
that
period
may
be
dated
the
power
of
the
janissaries
ibrahim
had
been
the
cause
of
their
rising
into
consideration
but
he
soon
found
that
their
party
was
acquiring
too
much
strength
he
therefore
deemed
it
necessary
to
countenance
the
sherifs
and
being
a
man
of
great
talents
he
governed
and
plundered
the
town
by
artfully
opposing
the
two
parties
to
each
other
in
the
year
ibrahim
was
nominated
to
the
pashalik
of
damascus
sherif
pasha
a
man
of
ordinary
capacity
being
sent
to
aleppo
the
janissaries
soon
usurped
the
powers
of
government
at
the
time
of
the
french
invasion
of
egypt
the
intrigues
of
djezzar
pasha
of
akka
drove
ibrahim
from
his
post
at
damascus
and
he
was
obliged
to
follow
the
grand
army
into
egypt
when
after
the
campaign
of
egypt
the
grand
vizir
with
the
remains
of
his
army
was
approaching
aleppo
upon
his
return
to
constantinople
ibrahim
conceived
hopes
of
regaining
his
lost
seat
at
aleppo
through
the
means
of
his
son
mohammed
beg
then
mobassei
the
janissaries
were
persuaded
that
the
vizir
had
evil
intentions
against
them
forged
letters
were
produced
to
that
effect
and
the
whole
body
of
janissaries
left
the
town
before
the
arrival
in
its
neighbourhood
their
flight
gave
ibrahim
the
sought
for
opportunity
to
represent
the
fugitives
to
the
vizir
as
rebels
afraid
to
meet
their
presence
they
were
shortly
afterwards
by
a
firmahn
from
the
porte
formally
proscribed
as
rebels
and
the
killing
of
any
of
them
who
should
enter
the
territory
of
aleppo
was
declared
lawful
they
had
retired
to
damascus
latikia
tripoli
and
the
mountains
of
the
druses
and
they
spared
no
money
to
get
the
edict
of
their
exile
rescinded
after
a
tedious
bargain
for
the
price
of
their
pardon
they
succeeded
at
last
in
obtaining
it
on
condition
of
paying
one
hundred
thousand
piastres
into
the
treasury
ibrahim
pasha
who
had
in
the
meanwhile
regained
the
pashalik
of
aleppo
was
to
receive
that
sum
from
them
and
he
had
so
well
played
his
game
that
the
janissaries
still
thought
him
their
secret
friend
the
principal
chiefs
trusting
to
assurances
came
to
the
town
for
the
purpose
of
paying
down
the
money
they
were
a
few
days
afterwards
arrested
and
it
was
generally
believed
that
ibrahim
would
order
them
the
same
night
to
be
strangled
in
turkey
however
there
are
always
hopes
as
long
as
the
purse
is
not
exhausted
the
prisoners
engaged
mohammed
beloved
son
to
intercede
in
their
favour
they
paid
him
for
that
service
one
thousand
zequins
in
advance
and
promised
as
much
more
and
he
effectually
extorted
from
his
father
a
promise
not
to
kill
any
of
them
it
is
said
that
ibrahim
foretold
his
son
that
the
time
would
come
when
he
would
repent
of
his
intercession
a
short
time
afterwards
ibrahim
was
nominated
a
second
time
to
the
pashalik
of
damascus
which
became
vacant
by
death
in
his
prisoners
were
obliged
to
follow
him
to
damascus
from
whence
they
found
means
to
open
a
correspondence
with
the
emir
beshir
the
chief
of
the
druses
and
to
prevail
upon
him
to
use
all
his
interest
with
ibrahim
to
effect
their
deliverance
ibrahim
stood
at
that
time
in
need
of
the
friendship
he
had
received
orders
from
the
porte
to
seize
upon
treasures
at
akka
and
to
effect
this
the
of
the
druse
chief
was
absolutely
necessary
upon
the
reiterated
applications
the
prisoners
were
at
last
liberated
when
ibrahim
pasha
removed
to
damascus
he
procured
the
pashalik
of
aleppo
for
his
son
mohammed
pasha
a
man
who
possesses
in
a
high
degree
the
qualification
so
necessary
in
a
delegate
of
the
porte
of
understanding
how
to
plunder
his
subjects
the
chief
of
a
sherif
family
ibn
hassan
aga
khalas
who
has
since
entered
into
the
corps
of
the
janissaries
and
is
now
one
of
their
principal
men
was
the
first
who
resolved
to
oppose
open
force
to
his
measures
he
engaged
at
first
only
seven
or
eight
other
families
to
join
him
and
it
was
with
this
feeble
force
that
the
rebellion
broke
out
which
put
an
end
to
the
government
the
confederates
began
by
knocking
down
the
men
in
the
streets
wherever
they
met
them
janissaries
soon
assembled
from
all
quarters
to
join
party
and
between
two
or
three
hundred
deli
bashi
or
regular
troops
of
the
pasha
were
massacred
in
the
night
in
their
own
habitations
to
which
the
rebels
found
access
from
the
neighbouring
terraces
or
flat
roofs
still
the
troops
would
have
subdued
the
insurgents
had
it
not
been
for
the
desperate
bravery
of
hassan
aga
after
several
months
daily
fighting
in
the
streets
in
which
the
troops
had
thrown
up
entrenchments
want
of
food
began
to
be
sensibly
felt
in
the
part
of
the
city
which
his
adherents
occupied
near
the
serai
a
very
spacious
building
now
in
ruins
he
came
therefore
to
the
resolution
of
abandoning
the
city
at
request
a
tartar
was
sent
from
constantinople
with
orders
enjoining
him
to
march
against
berber
governor
of
tripoli
who
had
been
declared
a
rebel
having
thus
covered
the
disgrace
of
his
defeat
he
marched
out
of
aleppo
in
the
end
of
but
instead
of
proceeding
to
tripoli
he
established
his
head
quarters
at
sheikh
abou
beker
a
monastery
of
derwishes
situated
upon
an
elevation
only
at
one
distance
from
aleppo
where
he
recruited
his
troops
and
prepared
himself
to
besiege
the
town
his
affairs
however
took
a
more
favourable
turn
upon
the
arrival
of
a
kapidgi
bashi
or
officer
of
the
porte
from
constantinople
who
carried
with
him
the
most
positive
orders
that
mohammed
pasha
should
remain
governor
of
aleppo
and
be
acknowledged
as
such
by
the
inhabitants
the
persuasions
as
well
as
the
commands
which
the
janissaries
did
not
dare
openly
to
disobey
brought
on
a
compromise
in
consequence
of
which
the
pasha
the
city
so
far
he
had
gained
his
point
but
he
soon
found
himself
in
his
palace
without
friends
or
influence
the
janissaries
were
heard
to
declare
that
every
body
who
should
visit
him
would
be
looked
upon
as
a
spy
on
fridays
alone
the
great
people
paid
him
their
visit
in
a
body
the
place
meanwhile
was
governed
by
the
chiefs
of
the
janissaries
and
the
sherifs
at
length
the
pasha
succeeded
by
a
secret
nightly
correspondence
to
detach
the
latter
from
the
janissaries
who
were
gaining
the
ascendancy
the
sherifs
are
the
natural
supporters
of
government
in
this
country
most
of
the
villages
round
aleppo
were
then
in
their
possession
they
command
the
landed
interests
all
the
aleppo
grandees
of
ancient
families
and
all
the
ulemas
and
effendis
belong
to
their
body
and
the
generality
of
them
have
received
some
education
while
out
of
one
hundred
janissaries
there
are
scarcely
five
who
know
how
to
read
or
to
write
their
own
names
the
civil
war
now
broke
out
afresh
and
mohammed
had
again
the
worst
of
it
after
remaining
three
months
in
the
town
he
returned
to
his
former
encampment
at
sheikh
abou
beker
from
whence
he
assisted
his
party
in
the
town
who
had
taken
possession
of
the
castle
and
several
mosques
this
warfare
lasted
nearly
two
years
without
any
considerable
losses
on
either
side
the
sherifs
were
driven
out
of
the
mosques
but
defended
themselves
in
the
castle
generally
the
people
of
aleppo
janissaries
as
well
as
sherifs
are
a
cowardly
race
the
former
never
ventured
to
meet
the
troops
on
the
outside
of
their
walls
the
latter
did
not
once
sally
forth
from
the
castle
but
contented
themselves
with
firing
into
the
town
and
principally
against
bankousa
a
quarter
exclusively
inhabited
by
janissaries
the
pasha
on
his
side
would
have
ordered
his
arnaouts
to
take
the
town
by
assault
had
not
his
own
party
been
jealous
of
his
military
power
and
apprehensive
of
the
fury
of
an
assaulting
army
for
which
reason
they
constantly
endeavoured
to
prevent
any
vigorous
attack
promising
that
they
would
alone
bring
the
enemy
to
terms
after
nearly
two
years
fighting
during
which
time
a
considerable
part
of
the
town
was
laid
in
ruins
the
pasha
with
the
sherifs
were
on
the
point
of
succeeding
and
compelling
the
janissaries
to
surrender
the
chiefs
of
the
janissaries
had
applied
to
the
european
consuls
for
their
mediation
between
them
and
the
pasha
the
conditions
of
their
surrender
were
already
drawn
up
and
in
a
few
days
more
their
power
in
aleppo
would
probably
have
been
for
ever
annihilated
by
a
treacherous
infraction
of
the
capitulation
when
by
a
fortunate
mistake
a
tartar
sent
from
constantinople
to
mohammed
entered
the
town
instead
of
taking
his
packet
to
sheikh
abou
beker
the
janissaries
opened
the
dispatches
and
found
them
to
contain
a
firmahn
by
which
mohammed
pasha
was
recalled
from
his
pashalik
of
aleppo
this
put
an
end
to
the
war
mohammed
dismissed
the
greater
part
of
his
troops
and
retired
the
janissaries
came
to
a
compromise
with
the
sherifs
in
the
castle
and
have
since
that
time
been
absolute
masters
of
the
city
i
can
not
omit
mentioning
that
during
the
whole
of
the
civil
war
the
persons
and
property
of
the
franks
were
rigidly
respected
it
sometimes
happened
that
parties
of
sherifs
and
janissaries
skirmishing
in
the
bazars
left
off
firing
by
common
consent
when
a
frank
was
seen
passing
and
that
the
firing
from
the
minarets
ceased
when
franks
passed
over
their
flat
roofs
from
one
house
to
another
the
janissaries
have
this
virtue
in
the
eyes
of
the
franks
that
they
are
not
in
the
smallest
degree
fanatical
the
character
of
a
sherif
is
quite
the
contrary
and
whenever
religious
disputes
happen
they
are
always
excited
and
supported
by
some
greenhead
since
the
removal
of
mohammed
pasha
the
porte
has
continued
to
nominate
his
successors
but
the
name
of
pasha
of
aleppo
is
now
nothing
more
than
a
vain
title
his
first
successor
was
alla
eddin
pasha
a
near
relation
of
sultan
selim
then
waledin
pasha
othman
pasha
darukly
ibrahim
pasha
a
third
time
and
the
present
governor
seruri
mohammed
pasha
except
the
last
who
is
now
in
the
grand
camp
near
constantinople
they
have
all
resided
at
aleppo
but
they
occupied
the
serai
more
like
state
prisoners
than
governors
they
never
were
able
to
carry
the
most
trifling
orders
into
effect
without
feeing
in
some
way
or
other
the
chiefs
of
the
ja
n
issaries
to
grant
their
consent
the
corps
of
janissaries
or
the
odjak
of
aleppo
was
formerly
divided
as
in
other
turkish
towns
into
companies
or
ortas
but
since
the
time
of
their
getting
into
power
they
have
ceased
to
submit
to
any
regular
discipline
they
form
a
disorderly
body
of
from
three
to
four
thousand
men
and
daily
increase
their
strength
and
number
by
recruits
from
the
sherifs
those
who
possess
the
greatest
riches
and
whose
family
and
friends
are
the
most
numerous
are
looked
upon
as
their
chiefs
though
they
are
unable
to
exercise
any
kind
of
discipline
of
these
chiefs
there
are
at
present
six
principal
ones
who
have
succeeded
in
sharing
the
most
lucrative
branches
of
the
revenue
and
what
seems
almost
incredible
they
have
for
the
last
six
years
preserved
harmony
amongst
themselves
hadji
ibrahim
ibn
herbely
is
at
this
moment
the
richest
and
most
potent
of
them
all
the
legal
forms
of
government
have
not
been
changed
and
the
janissaries
outwardly
profess
to
be
the
dutiful
subjects
of
the
porte
the
civil
administration
is
nominally
in
the
hands
of
the
mutsellim
who
is
named
by
the
pasha
and
confirmed
by
the
porte
the
kadhi
presides
in
the
court
of
justice
and
the
mohassel
or
chief
custom
house
officer
is
a
llowed
to
perform
his
functions
in
the
name
of
his
master
but
the
mutsellim
dares
not
enforce
any
orders
from
the
porte
nor
the
kadhi
decide
any
law
suit
of
importance
without
being
previously
sure
of
the
consent
of
some
of
the
chief
janissaries
the
revenue
which
the
grand
signior
receives
at
this
moment
from
aleppo
is
limited
to
the
miri
or
general
landtax
which
the
janissaries
themselves
pay
the
kharatsh
or
tribute
of
the
christians
and
jews
and
the
income
of
the
custom
house
which
is
now
rented
at
the
yearly
rate
of
eighty
thousand
piastres
besides
these
there
are
several
civil
appointments
in
the
town
which
are
sold
every
year
at
constantinople
to
the
highest
bidder
the
janissaries
are
in
the
possession
of
the
most
lucrative
of
them
and
remit
regularly
to
the
porte
the
purchase
money
the
outward
decorum
which
the
janissaries
have
never
ceased
to
observe
towards
the
porte
is
owing
to
their
fear
of
offending
public
opinion
so
as
to
endanger
their
own
security
the
porte
on
the
other
hand
has
not
the
means
of
subduing
these
rebels
established
as
their
power
now
is
without
calling
forth
all
her
resources
and
ordering
an
army
to
march
against
them
from
constantinople
the
expense
of
such
an
enterprize
would
hardly
be
counterbalanced
by
the
profits
of
its
success
for
the
janissaries
pushed
to
extremities
would
leave
the
town
and
find
a
secure
retreat
for
themselves
and
their
treasures
in
the
mountains
of
the
druses
both
parties
therefore
endeavour
to
avoid
an
open
rupture
it
is
well
known
that
the
chief
janissaries
send
considerable
presents
to
constantinople
to
appease
their
anger
and
provided
the
latter
draws
supplies
for
his
pressing
wants
no
matter
how
or
from
whence
the
insults
offered
to
his
supreme
authority
are
easily
overlooked
the
janissaries
chiefly
exercise
their
power
with
a
view
to
the
filling
of
their
purses
every
inhabitant
of
aleppo
whether
turk
or
christian
provided
he
be
not
himself
a
janissary
is
obliged
to
have
a
protector
among
them
to
whom
he
applies
in
case
of
need
to
arrange
his
litigations
to
enforce
payment
from
his
creditors
and
to
protect
him
from
the
vexations
and
exactions
of
other
janissaries
each
protector
receives
from
his
client
a
sum
proportionate
to
the
circumstances
of
the
affairs
it
varies
from
twenty
to
two
thousand
piastres
a
year
besides
which
whenever
the
protector
terminates
an
important
business
to
the
wishes
he
expects
some
extraordinary
reward
if
two
protectors
happen
to
be
opposed
to
each
other
on
account
of
their
clients
the
more
powerful
of
the
two
sometimes
carries
the
point
or
if
they
are
equal
in
influence
they
endeavour
to
settle
the
business
by
compromise
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
to
justice
only
half
its
due
those
janissaries
who
have
the
greatest
number
of
clients
are
of
course
the
richest
and
command
the
greatest
influence
but
these
are
not
the
only
means
which
the
janissaries
employ
to
extort
money
they
monopolize
the
trade
of
most
of
the
articles
of
consumption
which
have
risen
in
consequence
to
nearly
double
the
price
which
they
bore
six
years
ago
as
well
as
of
several
of
the
manufactures
of
aleppo
upon
others
they
levy
heavy
taxes
in
short
their
power
is
despotic
and
oppressive
yet
they
have
hitherto
abstained
from
making
like
the
pashas
avanies
upon
individuals
by
open
force
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
the
greater
part
of
the
aleppines
do
not
wish
for
the
return
of
a
pasha
though
the
janissaries
extort
from
the
public
by
direct
and
indirect
means
more
than
the
pashas
ever
did
by
their
avanies
each
individual
discharges
the
burthen
imposed
upon
him
more
readily
because
he
is
confident
that
it
insures
the
remainder
of
his
fortune
in
the
time
living
was
cheaper
and
regular
taxes
not
oppressive
but
the
pasha
would
upon
the
most
frivolous
pretexts
order
a
man
of
property
to
be
thrown
into
prison
and
demand
the
sacrifice
of
one
fourth
of
his
fortune
to
grant
him
his
deliverance
notwithstanding
the
immense
income
of
the
chief
janissaries
they
live
poorly
without
indulging
themselves
in
the
usual
luxuries
of
and
horses
their
gains
are
hoarded
in
gold
coin
and
it
is
easy
to
calculate
such
is
the
publicity
with
which
all
sort
of
business
is
conducted
that
the
yearly
income
of
several
of
them
can
not
amount
to
less
than
thirty
or
forty
thousand
pounds
sterling
it
is
necessary
to
have
lived
for
some
time
among
the
turks
and
to
have
experienced
the
mildness
and
peacefulness
of
their
character
and
the
sobriety
and
regularity
of
their
habits
to
conceive
it
possible
that
the
inhabitants
of
a
town
like
aleppo
should
continue
to
live
for
years
without
any
legal
master
or
administration
of
justice
protected
only
by
a
miserable
guard
of
police
and
yet
that
the
town
should
be
a
safe
and
quiet
residence
no
disorders
or
nightly
tumults
occur
and
instances
of
murder
and
robbery
are
extremely
rare
if
serious
quarrels
sometimes
happen
it
is
chiefly
among
the
young
janissaries
heated
with
brandy
and
amorous
passion
who
after
sunset
fight
their
rivals
at
the
door
of
some
prostitute
this
precarious
security
is
however
enjoyed
only
within
the
walls
of
the
city
the
whole
neighbourhood
of
aleppo
is
infested
by
obscure
tribes
of
arab
and
kurdine
robbers
who
through
the
negligence
of
the
janissaries
acquire
every
day
more
insolence
and
more
confidence
in
the
success
of
their
enterprises
caravans
of
forty
or
fifty
camels
have
in
the
course
of
last
winter
been
several
times

yards
from

city
gate
not
a
week
passes
without
somebody
being
and
stripped
in
the
gardens
near
the
town
and
the
robbers
have
even
sometimes
taken
their
rest
in
one
of
the
suburbs
of
the
city
and
there
sold
their
cheaply
acquired
booty
in
the
time
of
ibrahim
pasha
the
neighbourhood

five
hours
was
kept
in
perfect
security
from
all
hostile
inroads
of
the
arabs
by
the
cavalry
guard
of

but
the
janissaries
are
very
averse
from
exposing
themselves
to
danger
there
is

no
head
among
them
to
command
no

to
pay
