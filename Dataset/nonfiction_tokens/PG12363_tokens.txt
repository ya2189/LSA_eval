preface
to
the
second
volume
in
demonstrating
the
plants
which
occur
in
our
annual
herborizing
excursions
i
have
found
it
necessary
to
put
into
the
hands
of
my
pupils
some
manual
of
botany
and
in
so
doing
i
have
found
all
that
have
yet
been
published
deficient
in
one
or
two
essential
points
and
particularly
as
relating
to
the
uses
to
which
each
plant
is
adapted
with
out
which
although
the
charms
of
the
flora
are
in
themselves
truly
delightful
yet
the
real
value
of
botanic
knowledge
is
lost
the
study
of
plants
so
far
as
regards
their
uses
and
culture
has
engaged
my
particular
attention
for
the
last
years
during
which
time
i
had
the
honour
of
conducting
a
series
of
experiments
on
the
growth
of
plants
for
the
board
of
agriculture
which
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
ascertaining
many
facts
relative
to
our
grasses
an
account
of
which
i
have
had
some
time
ready
for
publication
the
necessity
of
a
work
of
this
kind
in
my
present
profession
has
therefore
induced
me
to
abridge
it
and
put
it
to
press
as
such
i
offer
it
to
the
public
to
the
subscribers
to
my
botanic
garden
this
will
also
prove
of
great
service
it
being
intended
to
arrange
the
plants
in
their
several
departments
so
as
to
make
it
a
general
work
of
reference
both
in
the
fields
or
garden
in
the
department
which
treats
of
the
vegetables
used
for
medicinal
purposes
i
have
given
as
ample
descriptions
as
the
nature
of
the
work
will
admit
of
having
in
view
the
very
necessary
obligation
which
the
younger
branch
of
the
profession
are
under
of
paying
attention
to
the
subject
in
prosecuting
this
work
i
have
been
more
actuated
by
a
desire
to
render
to
my
pupils
and
others
useful
than
that
of
commencing
author
on
such
a
subject
and
writing

has
been
but
very
little
my
employment
i
trust
that
an
ample
excuse
will
be
granted
for
any
errors
that
may
appear

for
the

observations
on

of

and
on

it
is
now
fifty
years
since
the
celebrated
stillingfleet
observed
that
it
was
surprising
to
see
how
long
mankind
had
neglected
to
make
a
proper
advantage
of
plants
of
so
much
importance
to
agriculture
as
the
grasses
which
are
in
all
countries
the
principal
food
of
cattle
the
farmer
for
want
of
distinguishing
and
selecting
the
best
kinds
fills
his
pastures
either
with
weeds
or
improper
plants
when
by
making
a
right
choice
he
would
not
only
procure
a
more
abundant
crop
from
his
land
but
have
a
produce
more
nourishing
for
his
flock
one
would
therefore
naturally
wonder
after
this
truth
has
been
so
long
published
and
that
in
an
age
when
agriculture
and
the
arts
have
so
much
improved
that
select
seeds
of
this
tribe
of
plants
are
scarcely
to
be
produced
from
the
experience
i
have
had
on
this
subject
i
find
their
culture
is
attended
with
certain
difficulties
which
arise
not
so
much
from
the
nature
of
the
plants
as
from
the
labour
requisite
to
this
purpose
great
attention
being
necessary
for
saving
at
the
seasons
when
the
farmer
must
exert
all
the
strength
of
his
husbandmen
to
get
his
other
business
accomplished
the
only
mode
by
which
this
can
be
effected
is
by
selecting
a
proper
soil
for
the
kinds
intended
to
be
saved
the
seeds
should
be
drilled
into
the
ground
at
about
one
foot
distance
and
care
taken
that
the
plants
are
duly
weeded
of
all
other
kinds
that
may
intrude
themselves
before
they
get
too
firm
possession
of
the
soil
the
hoe
should
be
frequently
passed
between
the
drills
in
order
both
to
keep
the
land
clean
and
to
give
vigour
to
the
young
plants
the
sowing
may
be
done
either
in
the
spring
or
in
the
month
of
september
which
will
enable
the
crop
to
go
to
seed
the
following
spring
in
order
to
preserve
a
succession
of
crops
it
is
necessary
every
season
to
keep
the
ground
clean
all
the
summer
months
to
dig
or
otherwise
turn
up
the
land
between
the
drills
early
in
the
spring
and
to
be
particular
in
the
other
operations
until
the
seeds
ripen
now
this
business
being
so
inconvenient
to
the
farmer
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
wherever
attempts
of
this
kind
have
been
made
they
should
fail
from
want
of
the
necessary
care
as
above
stated
without
which
it
is
needless
to
speculate
in
such
an
undertaking
there
is
nevertheless
still
an
opportunity
for
any
one
who
would
give
up
his
land
and
time
to
the
pursuit
to
reap
a
rich
and
important
harvest
as
nothing
would
pay
him
better
or
redound
more
to
his
credit
than
to
get
our
markets
regularly
supplied
with
select
seeds
of
the
best
indigenous
grasses
so
that
a
proper
portion
of
them
may
be
used
for
forming
pasture
and
the
above
hints
are
not
thrown
out
by
a
person
who
wishes
to
speculate
in
a
theory
which
is
new
but
by
one
who
has
cultivated
those
plants
himself
both
for
seed
and
fodder
and
who
would
readily
wish
to
promote
their
culture
by
stating
a
mode
which
has
proved
to
him
a
profitable
pursuit

which
he

of

must
not

allow
all
the

to
be
husbanded
as
above
and
although
it
will
not

on

it
nevertheless

its

if
it

planted
in

of

its

considerable
and
it
appears
to

well
adapted

the
seeds
of
this
grass
are
not
to
be
obtained
separately
hence
it
is
not
in

it
is
however
worthy
of
attention
as
the

are

from
the
good
appearance
of
this

some
persons
have
recommended
it
as
likely
to
be
useful
for
forming
meadows
but
it
is
excessively
bitter
and
is
not
liked
by
cattle
generally
though
when
starved
they
are
sometimes
observed
to
eat
of
it
there
is
a
variety
of
it
with
knobby
roots
which
is
found
to
be
a
most
troublesome
and
noxious
weed
in
arable
lands
particularly
in
some
parts
of
the
coast
of
hampshire
where
it
abounds
this
variety
was
some
years
ago
introduced
into
the
island
of
kitts
and
it
has
since
taken
such
firm
possession
of
the
land
as
to
render

large

quite
useless

should
be

they
speculate

worth

trouble
of
select

it
is
bitter

the
taste
bromus
mollis
soft
mr
curtis
has
given
a
very
clear
account
of
this
grass
which
he
says
predominates
much
in
the
meadows
near
london
but
that
the
seeds
are
usually
ripe
and
the
grass
dried
up
before
the
hay
time
hence
it
is
lost
and
he
in
consequence
considered
it
only
in
the
light
of
a
weed
it
has
seldom
occurred
to
me
to
differ
in
opinion
from
this
gentleman
who
certainly
has
given
us
as
far
as
it
goes
a
most
perfect
description
of
our
useful
grasses
but
experience
has
convinced
me
that
the
soft
which
seeds
and
springs
up
so
early
makes
the
chief
bulk
of
most
of
our
meadows
in
march
and
april
and
although
it
is
ripe
and
over
or
nearly
so
by
the
hay
harvest
yet
the
food
it
yields
at
this
early
season
is
of
the
greatest
moment
as
little
else
is
found
fit
for
the
food
of
cattle
before
the
meadow
is
shut
up
for
hay
and
this
plant
being
eaten
down
at
that
season
is
not
any
loss
to
the
hay
crop
whoever
examines
the
seeds
of
this
grass
will
be
led
to
admire
how
wonderfully
it
is
fitted
to
make
its
way
into
the
soil
at
the
season
of
its
ripening
when
the
land
is
thus
covered
with
the
whole
produce
of
a
meadow
i
notice
this
curious
piece
of
mechanism
footnote
many
seeds
of
the
grasses
are
provided
with
awns
which
curl
up
in
dry
weather
and
relax
with
moisture
thus
by
change
of
atmosphere
a
continued
motion
is
occasioned
which
enables
the
seeds
to
find
their
way
through
the
foliage
to
the
soil
where
it
buries
itself
in
a
short
time
in
a
very
curious
manner
not
that
it
is
altogether
peculiar
to
this
plant
but
to
show
that
nature
has
provided
it
means
of
succeeding
in
burying
itself
in
the
ground
when
all
the
endeavours
of
man
could
not
sow
the
land
with
any

that

in

it
is
otherwise

festuca

no
plant
whatever
deserves
so
much
the
attention
of
the
graziers
as
this
grass
it
has
been
justly
esteemed
by
curtis
and
all
other
persons
practically
acquainted
with
the
produce
of
our
meadows
it
will
grow
in
almost
any
soil
that
is
capable
of
sustaining
a
vegetable
from
the
banks
of
rivulets
to
the
top
of
the
calcareous
hills
where
it
produces
herbage
equal
to
any
other
plant
of
the
kind
and
all
descriptions
of
cattle
eat
it
and
are
nourished
by
the
food
the
plant
is
of
easy
culture
as
it
yields
seeds
very
abundantly
and
they
grow
very
readily
i
have
made
some
excellent
meadows
with
this
seed
which
after
a
trial
of
ten
years
are
now
equal
to
any
in
the
kingdom
the
culture
of
the
seed
selected
is
now
nearly
lost
which
is
a
misfortune
i
had
almost
ventured
to
say
a
disgrace
to
our
agriculture
if
the
farmer
could
get
his
land
fit
for
meadow
laid
down
with
one
bushel
of
this
seed
one
bushel
of
alopecurus
pratensis
three
pounds
of
anthoxanthum
and
a
little
bromus
mollis
with
clover
i
will
venture
to
predict
experience
will
induce
him
to
say
i
will
seek
no
further
festuca
sheep
this
is
very
highly
spoken
of
in
all
dissertations
that
have
hitherto
been
written
on
the
merits
of
our
grasses
but
its
value
must
be
confined
to
alpine
situations
for
its
diminutive
size
added
to
its
slow
growth
renders
it
in
my
opinion
very
inferior
to
the
duriuscula
in
fact
i
am
of
opinion
that
these
are
often
confounded
together
and
the
merits
of
the
former
applied
to
this
although
they
are
different
in
many
respects
those
who
wish
to
obtain
more
of
its
history

festuca
vivipara
viviparous
this
affords
a
striking
instance
of
the
protection
that
nature
has
contrived
for
keeping
up
the
regular
produce
of
the
different
species
of
plants
as
when
the
festuca
ovina
is
found
in
very
high
mountainous
situations
places
not
congenial
to
the
ripening
seeds
of
so
light
a
nature
the
panicle
is
found
to
become
viviparous
producing
perfect
plants
which
being
beaten
down
with
heavy
rains
in
the
autumn
readily
strike
root
in
the
ground
this
plant
was
introduced
into
our
garden
many
years
ago
and
still
preserves
this
difference
otherwise
it
is
in
all
respects
the
same
as
the
festuca
ovina
festuca
pinnata
spiked
i
have
observed
this
near
the
thames
side
to
be
the
principal
grass
in
some
of
the
most
abundant
meadows
and
as
the
seeds
are
very
plentiful
i
am
of
opinion
it
might
be
very
easily
propagated
it
is
however
not
in
cultivation
at
present
festuca
loliacea
darnel
this
in
appearance
is
very
like
the
lolium
perenne
but
is
a
more
lasting
plant
in
the
ground
where
i
have
seen
it
wild
it
is
certainly
very
good
but
it
is
liable
to
the
objection
of
festuca
elatior
the
seeds
grow
but
sparingly
holcus
lanatus
yorkshire
grass
or
meadow
this
has
been
much
recommended
as
fit
for
i
am
not
an
advocate
for
it
it
is
late
in
blooming
and
consequently
not
fit
for
the
scythe
at
the
time
other
grasses
are
and
i
find
the
lower
foliage
where
it
occurs
in
meadows
to
be
generally
yellow
and
in
a
state
of
decay
from
its
tendency
to
mat
and
lie
prostrate
i
hear
it
has
been
cultivated
in
yorkshire
hence
probably
its
name
two
bushels
of
the
seed
would
sow
an
acre
and
it
is
sometimes
met
with
in

it
will

soil

thrives

mr
curtis
in
the
third
edition
of
his
treatise
on
grasses
says
he
is
induced
to
have
a
better
opinion
than
formerly
of
this
grass
and
that
dorset
also
thinks
it
may
be
cultivated
to
advantage
in
dry
sandy
soils
i
have
never
seen
it
exhibit
any
appearance
that
has
indicated
any
such
thing
and
do
not
recommend
it
hordeum
pratense
meadow
this
is
productive
and
forms
a
good
bottom
in
battersea
meadows
but
although
i
have
heard
it
highly
recommended
i
should
fear
it
was
much
inferior
to
many
others
one
species
of
which
grows
very
commonly
in
our
the
hordeum
maritimum
is
apt
to
render
cattle
diseased
in
the
mouth
from
chewing
the
seeds
which
are
armed
with
a
strong
bristly
awn
not
dissimilar
to
the
spike
of
this
grass
lolium
perenne
or
this
has
been
long
in
cultivation
and
is
usually
sown
with
clover
under
a
crop
of
spring
corn
it
forms
in
the
succeeding
autumn
a
good
stock
of
herbage
and
the
summer
following
it
is
commonly
mown
for
hay
or
the
seed
saved
for
market
after
which
the
land
is
usually
ploughed
and
fallowed
to
clear
it
of
weeds
or
as
a
preparation
for
wheat
by
sowing
a
crop
of
winter
tares
or
turnips
the
seed
is
about
six
or
eight
pecks
per
acre
and
ten
pounds
of
clover
mixt
as
the
land
best
suits
although
this
is
a
very
advantageous
culture
for
such
purposes
and
when
the
land
is
not
to
remain
in
constant
pasture
yet
it
is
by
no
means
a
fit
grass
for
permanent
meadow
as
it
exhausts
the
soil
and
presently
goes
into
a
state
of
decay
for
want
of
nourishment
when
other
plants
natural
to
the
soil
are
apt
to
overpower
it
there
are
several
varieties
of
this
grass
some
i
have
seen
with
the
flowers
double
others
with
branched
panicles
some
that
grow
very
luxuriantly
and
others
that
are
little
better
than
annuals
and
there
is
also
a
variety
in
cultivation
called
pacey
much
sought
for
but
i
am
of
opinion
that
nothing
but
a
fine
rich
soil
will
produce
a
very
good
crop
and
that
the
principal
difference
after
all
is
owing
more
to
cultivation
or
change
of
soil
than
to
any
real
difference
in
the
plant
itself
melica
coerulea
blue
this
is
common
on
all
our
heaths
it
appears
coarse
and
not
a
grass
likely
to
be
useful
yet
this
kind
is
spoken
of
by
walker
under
the
name
of
who
says
it
is
one
of
the
most
productive
and
best
grasses
for
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
where
it
grows
to
the
height
of
three
feet
a
size
to
which
it
never
attains
in
this
part
of
the
country
it
is
found
in
all
soils
both
in
dry
and
boggy
places
panicum
germanicum

panic
or
i
notice
this
plant
here
although
it
is
not
a
native
of
this
country
neither
is
it
in
cultivation
it
was
introduced
some
years
since
by
sir
thomas
tyrrwhit
from
hungary
it
is
said
there
to
be
the
best
food
of
all
others
for
horses
and
i
think
it
might
be
cultivated
to
advantage
on
high
sandy
soils
as
a
late
crop
of
green
fodder
the
seeds
are
similar
to
millet
footnote
the
hungarian
horses
are
remarked
for
their
sleekness
and
it
is
said
that
it
is
in
consequence
of
being
fed
on
panicum
crus
galli
this
plant
has
i
believe
never
been
recommended
for
cultivation
but
it
possesses
qualities
which
render
it
worth
attention
it
will
sometimes
grow
to
the
height
of
four
feet
is
very
fine
food
for
cattle
and
will
no
doubt
make
excellent
hay
it
stands
dry
weather
better
than
most
other
grasses
i
know
the
seeds
will
not
vegetate
before
may
and
the
crop
not
in
perfection
till
late
september
in
dry
soils
i
think
it
could
be
cultivated
to
advantage
if
sown
among
a
crop
of
tares
or
rye
in
the
autumn
and
after
they
are
cut
in
summer
this
would
spring
up
and
be
a
valuable
acquisition
in
a
dry
autumn
as
it
would
seldom
fail
producing
an
abundant
crop
it
grows
thick
and
would
tend
to
clear
the
land
as
a
smothering
crop
over
weeds
it
is
annual
phalaris
arundinacea
reed
this
is
not
in
cultivation

grows
plentyfully
on
the
muddy
banks
of
the
thames
it
will
also
grow
very
well
in
a
moderately
dry
soil
and
i
have
observed
that
cattle
eat
it
when
it
is
young
as
it
is
early
and
very
productive
as
well
as
extremely
hardy
i
think
it
might
become
valuable
as
early
feed
the
seeds
of
this
plant
do
not
readily
grow
but
it
might
easily
be
introduced
by
planting
the
roots
in
the
spring
the
striped
or
ribbon
grass
of
the
flower
garden
is
only
a
variety
of
this
see
poa

pratense
or
is
very
coarse
and
late
and
consequently
not
equal
to
many
of
our
grasses
either
for
hay
or
pasture
it
has
been
highly
recommended
in
america
where
it
may
probably
have
been
found
to
answer
better
than
it
has
done
with
us
in
cultivation
the
seed
used
to
be
imported
from
new
york
and
met
with
a
ready
sale
but
i
believe
it
is
seldom
imported
at
this
time
walker
says
the
seeds
were
taken
from
south
carolina
where
it
was
first
cultivated
to
that
state
by
one
timothy
hanson
from
whence
it
acquired
its
name
the
same
gentleman
supposes
it
may
be
introduced
into
the
highlands
of
scotland
with
good
effect
but
is
of
my
opinion
as
to
its
utility
in
rural
economy
of

phleum

phleum

hudson
this
affects
a
drier
soil
than
the
it
grows
very
frequently
in
dry
thin
soils
where
it
maintains
itself
against
the
parching
sun
by
its
bulbous
roots
which
lie
dormant
for
a
considerable
time
but
grow
again
very
readily
when
the
wet
weather
sets
in
a
curious
circumstance
which
gives
us
an
ample
proof
of
the
wise
contrivance
of
the
great
author
of
nature
to
fertilize
all
kinds
of
soil
for
the
benefit
of
his
creatures
here
below
there
is
another
instance
of
this
in
the
poa

grows
on
the

have
kept

it
has
vegetated
afterwards

this
is
the
most
general
plant

nature

grows
in
almost
every
situation
where
there
is
any
vegetation
it
has
been
spoken
of
as
good
in
cultivation
and
has
had
the
term
suffolk
grass
applied
to
it
from
its
having
been
grown
in
that
county
i
have
never
seen
it
in
such
states
neither
can
i
say
i
should
anticipate
much
benefit
to
arise
from
a
plant
which
is
not
only
an
annual
but
very
diminutive
in
size
poa

this
is
quite
an
aquatic
but
is
eaten
when
young
by

and
is
very
useful
in
fenny
countries
it
is
highly
ornamental
and
might
be
introduced
into
ponds
for
the
same
purpose
as
arundo
phragmites
it
might
also
be
planted
with
festuca
elatior
and
phalaris

where
it
would
be
useful

would
be
of
all
others
the
most
nutritive
and
best
plant
for

but
it
thrives
only
in
water
i
have
noticed
it
only
because
it
is
highly
recommended
by
the
editor
of

observations
on

the

are
very
fond
of

is
not
to
be

sold
in

of
the
famous

at

near
salisbury
there
this
as
well
as
poa

most
certainly
is
in
its
highest
perfection
but
the
real
and
general
value
of
grasses
or
other
plants
must
not
be
estimated
by
such
very
local
instances
when
our
object
is
to
direct
the

to
a
general
knowledge
of
the

poa
trivialis
those
who
have
observed
this
grass
in
our
best
watered
meadows
and
in
other
low
have
naturally
been
struck
with
its
great
produce
and
fine
herbage
in
some
such
places
it
undoubtedly
appears
to
have
every
good
quality
that
a
plant
of
this
nature
can
possess
it
is
a
principal
grass
in
the
famous
orchiston
meadow
near
salisbury
and
its
amazing
produce
is
mentioned
in
the
bath
agricultural
papers
vol
but
persons
should
not
be
altogether
caught
by
such
appearances
for
i
have
seen
it
in
some
lands
and
such
as
would
produce
good
red
clover
a
very
diminutive
and
insignificant
plant
indeed
when
persons
wish
to
introduce
it
they
should
carefully
examine
their
neighbouring
pastures
and
see
how
it
thrives
in
such
places
the
seeds
are
small
and
six
pounds
would
be
sufficient
for
an
acre
with
others
that
affect
a
similar
soil
poa
pratensis
this
is
also
a
grass
of
considerable
merit
when
it
suits
the
soil
it
affects
a
dry
situation
and
in
some
such
places
it
is
the
principal
herbage
but
i
have
cultivated
this
by
itself
for
seed
in
tolerably
good
land
and
after
some
time
i
found
it
matted
so
much
by
its
creeping
roots
as
to
become
quite
unproductive
both
of
herbage
and
seed
care
should
therefore
be
taken
that
only
a
proper
portion
of
this
be
introduced
the
seeds
of
this
and
poa
trivialis
are
the
same
in
bulk
and
probably
the
same
proportion
should
be
adopted
the
seeds
of
both
species
hang
together
by
a
substance
like
to
cobwebs
when
thrashed

require
to
be
rubbed

in

footnote
this
technical
term
is
generally
known
to
farmers
it
is
applied
to
clovers
and
such
plants
as
usually
grow
in
pastures
and
not
strictly
under
this
term
are
included
such
plants
as
are
sown
for
fodder
either
with
a
view
to
form
permanent
pastures
when
mixed
with
the
grasses
or
as
intermediate
crops
on
arable
land
in
those
cases
they
are
usually
sown
with
a
spring
crop
of
oats
or
barley
and
the
artificial
grasses
are
protected
after
the
harvest
by
the
stubble
left
on
the

affording
the
succeeding

a
valuable
crop

achillea
millefolium
this
has
been
much
recommended
for
sheep
feed
but
i
observe
it
is
frequently
left
untouched
by
them
if
other
green
herbage
is
found
on
the
land
it
will
thrive
in
almost
any
soil
but
succeeds
best
in
good
loam

is
about
twelve

this
plant
is
not
in

but
it
has
been
noticed
that
where
it
grows
naturally
the
cows
produce
better
milk
and
in
greater
quantity
it
grows
best
in
calcareous
soils
the
seeds
are
large

this

well
deserves
attention
cichorium

cichory

been
said
of
the
good
properties
of
this
plant
and
if
it

them
to
the
full
extent
mentioned
by
different
authors
i
wonder
there
is
not

else
than

it
is
very
prolific
and
will
grow
extremely
quick
after

but
i
fear
from
the
observations
i
have
made
that
it
does
not
possess
the
fattening
quality
it
is
said
to
have
the
plant

so
extremely
bitter
that
although
cattle
may
be
inclined
to
feed
on
it
early
in
the
spring
yet
as
the
season
advances
and
other
herbage
more
palatable
is
to
be
met
with
it
is
left
with
its
beautiful
blue
flowers
and
broad
foliage
to
rob
the
soil
and
adorn
our
fields
to
the
regret
of
the
farmer
it
grows
wild
in
great
abundance
in
battersea
fields
where
my
late
friend
curtis
used
ludicrously
to
say
that
bad
husbandry
was
exhibited
to
perfection
this
plant
is
there
continually
seen
in
the
greatest
abundance
where
the
ground
has
not
been
lately
disturbed
even
under
the
noses
of
all
the

of
that
neighbourhood
that
are
turned
in

hedysarum

this
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
useful

of
this

in

is
the

of
the

in
such
places
it
is
the
principal

both
green
and
in

for
all
his
stock
i
have
not
observed
it
to
be
cultivated
in
worcestershire
or
herefordshire
where
there
appears
to
be
much
land
that
would
grow
it
and
which
is
under
much
inferior
crops
the
seed
sown
is
about
four
bushels
per

a
mistake
is
often
made
in
mentioning
this
plant
the
newspapers
in
quoting
prices
from
mark
lane
call
it
cinquefoil
a
very
different
plant
potentilla
of
rather
a
noxious
quality

lathyrus

meadow
abounds
much
in
our
natural
meadows
particularly
in
the
best
loamy

where
it
is
very
productive
and
nutritious
it
is
not
in
cultivation
for
the
seeds
do
not
readily
vegetate
a
circumstance
much
to
be
regretted
but
unfortunately
the
case
with
several
of
our
other
tares
which
would
otherwise
be
a
great
acquisition
to
our
graziers
lotus
corniculatus
there
are
several
varieties
of
this
plant
one
growing
on
very
dry
chalky
soils
and
which
in
such
places
helps
to
make
a
good
turf
and
is
much
relished
by
cattle
the
other
varieties
grow
in
marshy
land
and
make
much
larger
plants
than
the
other
here
it
is
also
much
eaten
and
i
have
also
noticed
it
in
hay
where
it
appears
to
be
a
good
ingredient
as
it
thus
appears
to
grow
in
any
situation
there
is
no
doubt
if
the
seeds
were
collected
that
it
might
be
cultivated
with
ease
and
turn
to
good
account
in
such
land
as
is
too
light
for
clover
in
wet
and
boggy
situations
it
becomes
very
hairy
and
in
this
state
its
appearance
is
very
different
from
that
which
it
has
when
growing
in
chalk
where
it
is
perfectly
smooth
this
plant
should
not
be
overlooked
by
the
experimental
farmer
it
is
very
highly
spoken
of
in
anderson
essays
on
agriculture
under
the
mistaken
name
of
astragalus
glycophyllos
but
a
truly
practical
account
is
given
of
it
by
ellis
in
his
husbandry
by
the
old
name
medicago
falcata
yellow
is
nearly
allied
to
lucerne
and
is
equally
good
for
fodder
it
will
grow
on
land
that
is
very
dry
and
hence
is
likely
to
become
a
most
useful
plant
its
culture
has
however
been
tried
but
partially
some
experiments
were
made
with
this
plant
by
thomas
le
blanc
in
suffolk
which
are
recorded
by
professor

this
is
also
a
plant
much
relished
by

but
is
not
in
cultivation
it
is
an
annual
and
perhaps
inferior
in
many
respects
to
the
nonsuch
which
it
in
some
measure
resembles
there
are
many
varieties
of
this
plant
cultivated
in

on
account
of
the
curious

much
can
not
be
said
in
praise
of

most
useful
perennial
plant
it
is
every
thing
the
farmer
can
wish
for
excepting
that
it
will
not
grow
without
proper
culture
it
should
be
drilled
at
eighteen
inches

i
have
known

sown
with
grass
and
clover
for
forming
meadow
land
but
as
it
does
not
thrive
well
when
encumbered
with
other
plants
i
see
no
good
derived
from
this
practice
no
plant
requires

in

it

thrive
in
any

particularly
in
rocky

it
is
much
grown
on
the

in

where
by
its
roots
spreading
from

it
is
often
found
to
prevent

in

much
esteemed

near

in

i
have
observed
it
to

any

sheep
are

i
have

i
do
not

to

found

trifolium
pratense
red
this
is
a
very
old
plant
in
cultivation
and
perhaps
with
little
exception
one
of
the
most
useful
it
is
very
productive
and
nutritive
but
soon
exhausts
the
soil
and
unless
it
is
in
particular
places
it
presently
is
found
to
go
off
which
with
the
grazier
is
become
a
general
complaint
of
all
our
cultivated
clovers
it
is
also
well
known
that
if
the
crop
is
mown
the
plant
is
the
sooner
exhausted
seeds
of
clover
have
the
property
of
remaining
long
in
the
ground
after
it
has
become
thus
in
a
manner
exhausted
and
it
frequently
occurs
that
ashes
being
laid
on
will
stimulate
the
land
afresh
and
cause
the
seeds
to
vegetate
which
has
given
rise
to
the
erroneous
opinion
with
many
persons
that
ashes
and
particularly
soap
ashes
will
when
sown
on
land
produce
clover
red
clover
is
usually
cultivated
in
stiff
clays
or
loamy
soils
and
when
sown
alone
about
sixteen
or
eighteen
pounds
of
seed
are
used
for
the
acre
trifolium
medium
zigzag
or
is
in
some
degree
like
the
preceeding
it
produces
a
purple
flower
and
the
foliage
is
much
the
same
in
appearance
but
this
is
a
much
stronger
perennial
and
calculated
from
its
creeping
roots
to
last
much
longer
in
the
land
it
is
equally
useful
as
a
food
for
cattle
and
does
not
possess
that
dangerous
quality
of
causing
cattle
to
be
hove
or
blown
by
eating
it
when
fresh
and
green
this
plant
is
however
only
to
be
met
with
in
upland
pastures
and
there
in
its
wild
state
for
it
does
not
seed
very
abundantly
and
is
not
in
cultivation
in
the
london
we
often
hear
of
a
species
of
red
clover
termed
and
it
generally
sells
for
more
money
and
is
said
to
differ
in
having
the
characters
ascribed
to
it
of
this
plant
namely
a
hollow
stem
the
leaves
more
sharply
pointed
the
plant
being
a
stronger
perennial
and
having
the
property
of
not
causing
the
disorder
to
cows
that
eat
of
it
it
is
said
to
be
cultivated
in
hampshire
from
whence
i
have
often
received
the
seeds
which
have
been
purchased
purposely
for
the
experiment
but
on
growing
them
i
never
could
discover
these
differences
to
exist
it
is
a
circumstance
worthy
notice
that
the
very
exact
character
of
the
trifolium
medium
should
thus
be
said
to
belong
to
the
supposed
variety
of
red
clover
i
have
endeavoured
for
the
last
twenty
years
to
find
out
the
true
and
am
of
opinion
that
it
has
been
from
some
cause
mistaken
for
this
plant
the
trifolium
medium
is
at
all
events
a
plant
worth
attention
and
i
think
it
might
be
easily
brought
into
cultivation
for
although
it
does
not
seed
so
abundantly
as
the
pratense
i
have
observed
it
in
places
where
a
considerable
quantity
has
been
perfected
and
where
it
might
have
been
easily
collected
by
gathering
the
capsules
trifolium
repens
dutch
this
is
not
so
robust
a
plant
as
either
of
the
former
kinds
but
it
creeps
on
the
ground
and
forms
a
fine
bottom
in
all
lands
wherever
it
occurs
either
cultivated
or
wild
this
has
not
the
property
of
blowing
the
cattle
in
so
great
a
degree
as
the
other
sorts
have
this
disease
is
said
to
be
accelerated
by
clover
being
eaten
whilst
the
dew
is
on
it
and
when
green
clover
is
intended
to
be
used
as
fodder
it
is
always
best
to
mow
it
in
the
heat
of
the
day
and
let
it
lie
till
it
is
whithered
when
it
may
be
given
to
cows
with
safety
clover
seeds
of
all
kinds
are
necessary
ingredients
in
laying
down
land
to
pasture
and
the
usual
quantity
is
about
twelve
pounds
per
acre
mixt
in
proportion
at
the
option
of
the
grower
this
kind
remains
longer
in
slight
soils
than
the
red
does
but
although
both
are
perennial
plants
they
are
apt
to
go
off
for
the
reason
pointed
out
under
the
head
of
pratense
this
plant
as
well
as
the
medium
and
other
perennial
kinds
is
sometimes
found
in
old
pastures
on
loamy
soils
and
whenever
this
is
the
case
it
is
a
certain
indication
of
the
goodness
of
the
soil
and
such
as
a
judicious
gardener
would
make
choice
of
for
potting
his
exotic
plants
in
as
he
may
rest
assured
that
the
soil
which
will
maintain
clover
for
a
succession
of
seasons
will
be
fit
loam
for
such
purposes
trifolium
procumbens
yellow
an
annual
very
like
the
nonsuch
it
is
a
very
useful
plant
seeding
very
freely
in
pastures
and
growing
readily
by
which
means
it
is
every
year
renewed
and
affords
a
fine
bite
for
sheep
and
cattle
i
have
now
and
then
seen
the
seeds
of
this
in
the
shops
but
it
is
not
common
there
is
a
gentleman
who
cultivates
this
plant
very
successfully
near
horsham
and
who
i
am
informed
states
it
to
be
the
best
kind
of
clover
for
that
land
it
grows
very
commonly
amongst
the
herbage
on
horsham
common
so
that
it
is
probably
its
native
habitat
the
seeds
are
the
smallest
of
all
the
cultivated
clovers
and
of
course
less
in
weight

trifolium
ochroleucum
yellow
this
is
not
a
common
plant
but
it
deserves
the
attention
of
the
grazier
i
believe
it
is
not
in
cultivation
in
the
garden
it
stands
well
and
is
a
large
plant
the
herbage
appears
to
be
as
good
as
that
of
any
other
kind
of
clover
and
it
might
if
introduced
be
cultivated
by
similar
means
trifolium
agrarium
hop
this
is
also
a
good
plant
but
not
in
cultivation
it
is
eaten
by
cattle
in
its
wild
state
is
a
perennial
and
certainly
deserves
a
trial
with
such
persons
who
may
be
inclined
to
make
experiments
with
these
plants
buffalo
clover
is
a
kind
similar
to
trifolium
agrarium
and
trifolium
repens
and
appears
to
me
to
be
a
hybrid
plant
this
has
been
sometimes
sent
to
this
country
from
america
and
is
a
larger
plant
than
either
it
has
however
as
far
as
i
have
grown
it
the
same
property
of
exhausting
the
soil
as
all
the
other
species
possess
and
is
soon
found
to
go
off
it
is
not
in
cultivation
to
any
large
extent
vicia
cracca
tufted
persons
who
have
most
noticed
this
plant
have
imagined
it
might
be
introduced
into
cultivation
it
is
hardy
durable
nutritious
and
productive
but
like
the
yellow
vetchling
the
seeds
do
not
readily
vegetate
the
only
way
to
cultivate
it
therefore
would
be
by
planting
out
the
roots
which
might
be
done
as
they
are
easily
parted
and
are
to
be
procured
in
great
plenty

the
places

it
grows
wild
vicia
sativa
vetches
fetch
or
a
very
useful
and
common
plant
of
which
we
have
two
varieties
known
to
the
farmer
by
the
name
of
spring
and
winter
tares
they
are
both
annuals
the
spring
variety
is
a
more
upright
growing
plant
and
much
tenderer
than
the
other
it
is
usually
sown
in
march
and
april
and
affords
in
general
fine
summer
fodder
the
winter
tares
are
usually
sown
at
the
wheat
remain
all
winter
and
are
usually
cut
in
the
spring
generally
six
weeks
before
the
spring
crop
comes
in
the
winter
tares
are
now
considered
a
crop
worth
attention
by
the
farmers
near
london
who
sow
them
and
sell
the
crop
in
small
bundles
in
the
spring
at
a
very
good
price
tares
are
usually
sown
broadcast
about
three
bushels
and
a
half
to
the
acre
persons
should
be
careful
in
procuring
the
true
variety
for
the
winter
sowing
for
i
have
frequently
known
a
crop
fail
altogether
by
sowing
the
spring
tares
which
is
a
more
tender
variety
at
that
season
it
should
be
noticed
that
the
seeds
of
both
varieties
are
so
much
alike
that
the
kinds
are
not
to
be
distinguished
but
the
plants
are
easily
known
as
soon
as
they
begin
to
grow
and
form
stems
the
spring
kind
having
a
very
upright
habit
and
the
winter
tares
trail
on
the
ground
it
is
usual
for
persons
wanting
seeds
of
such
to
procure
a
sample
and
by
growing
them
in
a
hothouse
or
forcing
frame
they
may
soon
be
able
to
ascertain
the
kinds
ellis
in
his
husbandry
says
that
if
ewes
are
fed
on
tares
the
lambs
they
produce
will
invariably
have
red
flesh
vicia
sylvatica
wood
a
perennial
plant
growing
in
the
shade
it
seems
to
have
all
the
good
properties
in
general
with
the
other
sorts
of
tares
but
it
is
not
in
cultivation
vicia
sepium
bush
is
also
a
species
much
eaten
by
cattle
in
its
wild
state
but
has
not
yet
been
cultivated
it
nevertheless
would
be
an
acquisition
if
it
could
be
got
to
grow
in
quantity
so
much
having
been
said
of
the
different
kinds
of
tares
perhaps
some
persons
may
be
inclined
to
think
that
it
would
be
superfluous
to
have
more
in
cultivation
than
one
or
two
sorts
to
this
i
would
beg
leave
to
reply
that
they
do
not
all
grow
exactly
in
the
same
situations
wild
and
if
they
were
cultivated
some
one
of
them
might
be
found
to
suit
in
certain
lands
better
than
others
and
perhaps
we
never
shall
see
our
agriculture
at
the
height
of
improvement
till
by
some
measure
all
those
things
shall
be
grown
for
the
purposes
of
fair
comparative
experiment
an
institution
much
wanted
in
this
country
hints
as
to
the
laying
down
land
to
permanent
pasture
having
endeavoured
to
explain
as
nearly
as
possible
the
nature
and
uses
of
the
plants
which
are
likely
to
improve
our
meadows
and
pastures
i
shall
proceed
to
describe
the
best
approved
mode
of
sowing
the
land
on
which
depends
in
a
great
measure
the
future
success
of
the
husbandman
labour
under
the
head
lolium
perenne
i
observed
the
practice
of
sowing
clovers
and
that
grass
with
a
crop
of
barley
or
oats
which
is
intended
as
an
intermediate
crop
for
a
season
or
two
and
then
the
land
to
be
again
broken
up
and
used
for
arable
crops
and
this
is
a
common
and
useful
practice
for
although
neither
the
clover
or
will
last
long
yet
both
will
be
found
to
produce
a
good
crop
whilst
the
land
will
bear
it
or
until
it
is
overpowered
by
the
natural
weeds
of
the
ground
footnote
it
is
not
an
uncommon
opinion
amongst
farmers
that
produces
couch
and
this
is
not
extraordinary
for
if
the
land
is
at
all
furnished
with
this
weed
it
receives
great
encouragement
under
this
mode
of
culture
which
renders
it
necessary
to
the
farmer
to
break
it
up
i
am
aware
of
the
difficulty
of
persuading
persons
farmers
in
particular
to
adopt
any
new
systems
and
i
have
often
when
speaking
of
this
subject
amongst
men
of
enlightened
understandings
been
told
it
would
be
next
to
madness
to
sacrifice
the
benefit
of
a
crop
of
oats
or
barley
when
the
land
is
in
fine
tilth
and
whilst
we
can
grow
grass
seeds
underneath
it
to
this
i
reply
that
there
is
no
land
whatever
when
left
for
a
few
months
in
a
state
of
rest
but
will
produce
naturally
some
kind
of
herbage
good
and
bad
and
thus
we
find
the
industry
of
man
excited
and
the
application
of
the
hoe
and
the
weeder
continually
among
all
our
crops
this
being
essential
to
their
welfare
i
can
not
help
therefore
observing
how
extremely
absurd
it
is
to
endeavour
to
form
clean
and
good
pasturage
under
a
crop
hat
gives
as
much
protection
to
every
noxious
weed
as
to
the
young
grass
itself
weeds
are
of
two
descriptions
and
each
requires
a
very
different
mode
of
extermination
thus
if
annual
as
the
charlock
and
poppy
they
will
flower
among
the
corn
and
the
seeds
will
ripen
and
drop
before
harvest
and
be
ready
to
vegetate
as
soon
as
the
corn
is
removed
and
if
perennial
as
thistles
docks
and
a
long
tribe
of
others
in
this
way
well
known
to
the
farmer
they
will
be
found
to
take
such
firm
possession
of
the
ground
that
they
will
not
be
got
rid
of
without
great
trouble
and
expense
although
the
crop
of
corn
thus
obtained
is
valuable
yet
when
a
good
and
permanent
meadow
is
wanted
and
when
all
the
strength
of
the
land
is
required
to
nurture
the
young
grass
thus
robbed
and
injured
the
proprietor
is
often
at
considerable
expense
the
second
year
for
manure
which
taking
into
consideration
the
trouble
and
disadvantage
attending
it
more
than
counterbalances
the
profit
of
the
corn
crop
to
accomplish
fully
the
formation
of
permanent
meadows
three
things
are
necessary
namely
to
clean
the
land
to
produce
good
and
perfect
seeds
adapted
to
the
nature
of
the
soil
and
to
keep
the
crop
clean
by
eradicating
all
the
weeds
till
the
grasses
have
grown
sufficiently
to
prevent
the
introduction
of
other
plants
the
first
of
these
matters
is
known
to
every
good
farmer
the
second
may
be
obtained
and
the
third
may
be
accomplished
by
practising
the
modes
in
which
i
have
succeeded
at
a
small
comparative
expense
and
trouble
and
which
is
instanced
in
a
meadow
immediately
fronting
brompton
crescent
the
property
of
angus
macdonald
esq
which
land
was
very
greatly
encumbered
with
noxious
weeds
of
all
kinds
but
by
the
following
plan
the
grasses
were
encouraged
to
grow
up
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
plants
and
though
it
has
been
laid
down
more
than
ten
years
the
pasturage
is
now
at
least
equal
to
any
in
the
county
grass
seeds
may
be
sown
with
equal
advantage
both
in
spring
and
autumn
the
land
above
mentioned
was
sown
in
the
latter
end
of
august
and
the
seed
made
use
of
was
one
bushel
of
and
one
of
meadow
with
a
mixture
of
fifteen
pounds
of
white
clover
and
trefoil
per
acre
the
land
was
previously
cleaned
as
far
as
possible
with
the
plough
and
harrows
and
the
seeds
sown
and
covered
in
the
usual
way
in
the
month
of
october
following
a
most
prodigious
crop
of
annual
weeds
of
many
kinds
having
grown
up
were
in
bloom
and
covered
the
ground
and
the
sown
grasses
the
whole
was
then
mowed
and
carried
off
the
land
and
by
this
management
all
the
annual
weeds
were
at
once
destroyed
as
they
do
not
spring
again
if
cut
down
when
in
bloom
thus
whilst
the
stalks
and
roots
of
the
annual
weeds
were
decaying
the
sown
grasses
were
getting
strength
during
the
fine
weather
and
what
few
perennial
weeds
were
amongst
them
were
pulled
up
by
hand
in
their
young
state
the
whole
land
was
repeatedly
rolled
to
prevent
the
worms
and
frost
from
throwing
the
plants
out
of
the
ground
and
in
the
following
spring
it
was
grazed
till
the
latter
end
of
march
when
it
was
left
for
hay
and
has
ever
since
continued
a
good
field
of
grass
several
meadows
at
roehampton
belonging
to
the
late
goldsmid
were
laid
down
with
two
bushels
of
meadow
and
fifteen
pounds
of
mixed
clover
and
sown
in
the
spring
along
with
one
peck
and
a
half
of
barley
intended
as
a
shade
to
the
young
grasses
the
crop
was
thus
suffered
to
grow
till
the
latter
end
of
june
and
then
the
corn
with
the
weeds
was
mowed
and
carried
off
the
land
the
ground
was
then
rolled
and
at
the
end
of
july
the
grasses
were
so
much
grown
as
to
admit
good
grazing
for
sheep
which
were
kept
thereon
for
several
weeks
it
should
be
observed
that
the
corn
is
to
be
mowed
whilst
in
bloom
and
when
there
is
an
appearance
of
or
immediately
after
rain
which
will
be
an
advantage
to
the
grasses
and
occasion
them
to
thrive
greatly
i
sowed
some
fields
for
the
same
gentleman
in
autumn
in
the
same
way
and
found
them
to
succeed
equally
well
the
above
remarks
are
part
of
a
communication
i
gave
six
years
since
to
the
society
of
arts
for
which
i
was
honoured
with
their
prize
medal
and
i
have
great
pleasure
in
transcribing
it

as
i
frequently
visit
the
meadows
mentioned
above
and
have
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
them
pronounced
the
best
in
their
respective
neighbourhoods
thus
are
my
opinions
on
this
head
borne
out
by
twelve
years
experience
let
the
sceptic
compare
this
improvement
with
his
pretended
advantage
of
a
crop
of
barley
it
should
be
observed
that
our
agricultural
efforts
are
intended
only
to
assist
the
operations
of
nature
and
that
in
all
our
experiments
we
should
consult
the
soil
as
to
its
spontaneous
produce
from
whence
alone
we
can
be
enabled
to
adapt
with
propriety
plants
to
proper
situations
the
kinds
of
selected
that
are
at
this
time
to
be
purchased
are
few
and
consist
of
lolium
perenne
festuca
pratensis
alopecurus
pratensis
dactylis
glomeratus
cynosurus
cristatus
with
the
various
kinds
of
clovers
and
it
is
not
easy
to
lay
down
any
rule
as
to
the
mixture
or
proportion
of
each
different
kind
that
would
best
suit
particular
lands
attention
however
should
in
all
cases
be
paid
to
the
plants
growing
wild
in
the
neighbouring
pastures
or
in
similar
soils
and
the
greater
portion
used
of
those
which
are
observed
to
thrive
best
in
certain
instances
i
have
mentioned
particular
quantities
of
seeds
to
be
mixed
with
others
but
in
general
i
have
stated
how
much
it
would
require
to
sow
an
acre
with
each
kind
separately
from
which
a
person
may
form
a
criterion
when
several
sorts
are
used
as
to
what
quantity
of
each
sort
should
be
adopted
taking
into
view
therefore
that
nothing
but
a
mixture
of
proper
kinds
of
grasses
will
make
good
pasturage
and
that
our
knowledge
is
very
imperfect
on
this
head
at
the
present
season
we
must
advise
that
particular
attention
be
paid
to
the
subject
or
little
good
can
be
hoped
for
from
all
our
endeavours

the
student
in
agriculture
will
find
in
this
department
a
wide
field
for
speculation
which
although
it
has
been
greatly
improved
during
the
last
century
still
affords
much
room
for
experiments
during
the
last
years
i
have
had
opportunity
of
observing
the
great
difference
in
the
quantity
of
cattle
brought
to
one
of
our
largest
in
the
south
of
england
and
it
is
well
known
that
this
has
increased
in
a
ratio
of
more
than
double
and
i
am
informed
by
a
worthy
and
truly
honourable
prelate
who
has
observed
the
same
for
years
previously
that
it
has
nearly
quadrupled
i
have
also
made
it
my
business
as
a
subject
of
curiosity
to
inquire
if
the
increase
at
other
markets
has
been
the
same
and
from
all
accounts
i
am
convinced
of
the
affirmative
now
as
we
have
ample
proofs
from
the
statistical
accounts
of
our
husbandry
that
less
corn
has
not
been
grown
in
the
same
period
we
shall
naturally
be
inclined
to
give
the
merit
of
this
increase
to
the
introduction
of
the
turnip
husbandry
which
although
it
is
now
become
so
general
is
comparatively
speaking
but
in
its
infancy
and
it
is
from
that
branch
of
our
agriculture
that
has
sprung
the
culture
of
the
great
variety
of
fodder
of
the
description
which
i
am
now
about
to
explain
and
here
it
may
not
prove
amiss
to
observe
to
the
botanical
student
should
he
hereafter
be
destined
to
travel
that
by
making
himself
thus
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
such
vegetables
he
may
have
it
in
his
power
to
render
great
benefit
to
society
by
the
introduction
of
others
of
still
superior
virtues
for
the
use
both
of
man
and
the
brute
creation
when
sir
walter
raleigh
undertook
his
expedition
to
south
america
the
object
of
which
failed
he
had
the
good
fortune
from
his
taste
for
botany
to
render
to
his
country
and
to
the
world
at
large
a
more
essential
service
by
the
introduction
of
one
single
vegetable
than
was
ever
achieved

performed

many
remedies
against
this
evil
are
enumerated
in

the
best
preventative
however
appears
to
be
the
putting
manure
on
the

a
moist
state
and
sowing
the
seeds
with

have
this

seen
a
fine
field
of

sown
mixt
with
dung
out
of
a

and
ploughed
in
ridges
the

which
were
not

scarcely
a

escaped
the

turnips
are
sown
either
or
in
drills
it
takes
about
four
pounds
of
seed
per
acre
in
the
first
mode
and
about
half
the
quantity
in
the
second
there
are
several
varieties
of

grown
for

the
most
striking
of
which
are
the
white
round
norfolk
the
red
round
ditto
the
green
round
ditto
the
tankard
the
yellow
these
varieties
are
nearly
the
same
in
goodness
and
produce
the
green
and
red
are
considered
as
rather
more
hardy
than
the
others
the
tankard
is
and
stands
more
out
of
the
ground
and
is
objected
to
as
being
more
liable
to
the
attack
of
early
frosts
the
yellow
is
much
esteemed
in
scotland
and
supposed
to
contain
more
nutriment
footnote
the
usual
season
for
sowing
the
above
varieties
is
within
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
after
the
stone
and
dutch
turnips
are
grown
for
culinary
purposes
and
are
also
sometimes
sown
after
the
corn
is
cleared
as
being
small
and
of
early
growth
these
in
such
cases
are
called
stubble
turnips
and
often
in
fine
autumns
produce
a
considerable

the

see
mr

on

it
is
well
known
to
gardeners
that
the
cabbage
tribe
are
liable
to
sport
thus
in
their
progeny
and
to
some
accidental
occurrence
of
this
nature
we
are
indebted
for
the
very
useful
plant
called
the
swedish
which
is
a
hybrid
plant
of
the
turnip
and
cabbage
and
what
has
within
these
few
years
added
so
much
to
the
benefit
of
the
grazier
this
root
is
much
more
hardy
than
any
of
the
turnips
it
will
stand
our
winters
without
suffering
injury
from
frosts
and
is
particularly
ponderous
and
nutritious
it
is
usually
cultivated
as
the
common
trunip
with
this
difference
that
it
requires
to
be
sown
as
early
in
some
lands
as
the
month
of
may
it
being
a
plant
which
requires
a
longer
time
to
come
to
maturity
every
judicious
farmer
who
depends
on
turnips
for
foddering
his
stock
in
the
winter
will
do
well
to
guard
against
the
loss
sometimes
occasioned
by
the
failure
of
his
turnips
from
frost
and
wet
various
ways
of
doing
this
are
recommended
as
stacking
but
if
he
has
a
portion
of
his
best
land
under
swedish
turnip
he
will
have
late
in
the
winter
a
valuable
crop
that
will
be
his
best
substitute
another
advantage
is
this
that
it
will
last
a
fortnight
longer
in
the
spring
and
consequently
be
valuable
on
this
account
the
quantity
of
seed
usually
sown
is
the
same
as
for
the
common
kinds
of
turnip
there
are
two
varieties
of
this
plant
one
white

by
that
class
of
readers
for
which
this
work
is
mostly
intended
i
shall
give
a
short
sketch
of
it
is
a
natural
principle
of
vegetation
that
every
seed
undergoes
a
change
before
it
is
formed
into
the
young
plant
the
substance
of
the
cotyledons
which
when
ground
forms
the
nutritious
flower
of
which
bread
is
made
changes
into
two
particular
substances
sugar
and
mucilage
and
whilst
mankind
form
from
it
the
principal
staff
of
life
as
an
edible
commodity
the
same
parts
of
the
seed
in
barley
are
by
certain
means
made
into
malt
which
is
only
another
term
for
the
sugar
of
that
grain
to
effect
this
the
barley
is
steeped
in
water
and
afterwards
laid
in
heaps
in
which
state
it
vegetates
in
a
few
days
and
the
saccharine
fermentation
is
by
that
means
carried
on
to
a
certain
pitch
when
it
is
put
on
a
kiln
to
which
a
fire
is
applied
and
it
is
by
that
means
dried
it
is
then
perfect
malt
and
fit
for
the
purpose
of
brewing
pearl
and
scotch
barley
used
for
soup
and
medicinal
purposes
are
made
from
the
grain
by
being
put
into
a
mill
which
merely
grinds
off
the
husk
the
pearl
barley
is
mostly
prepared
in
holland
but
the
scotch
is
made
near
edinburgh
in
considerable
quantities
a
description
of
an
improved
mill
for
this
purpose
is
to
be
seen
in
the
edinburgh
encyclopaedia
hordeum
vulgare
bere
big
or
winter
this
is
a
coarser
grain
than
the
barley
and
hence
it
is
not
so
well
adapted
to
the
purpose
of
malting
it
is
grown
on
cold
thin
soils
being
much
hardier
than
the
former
it
is
now
often
sown
in
october
and
in
the
month
of
may
or
june
following
it
is
mown
and
taken
off
the
land
for
green
fodder
the
plants
will
notwithstanding
this
produce
in
august
a
very
abundant
crop
of
grain
hence
this
is
a
valuable
mode
of
culture
for
the
farmer
the
other
varieties
of
barley
are
hordeum
hexastichon
this
is
also
a
coarse
grain
and
although
it
was
once
in
cultivation
here
it
has
been
altogether
superseded
by
the
bere
which
is
a
better
kind

footnote
at

made
an

from
directions

emigrant
of
mixing
pease
with
urine
in
which
had
been
steeped
a
considerable
quantity
of
pigeon
dung
in
the
course
of
hours
they
had
swoln
very
much

they
were
put
into
the
ground
an
equal
quantity
were
steeped
in
water
and
the
same
quantity
also
that
had
not
been
steeped
were
sown
in
three
adjoining
spots
of
land
there
was
a
difference
in
the
coming
up
of
the
crops
of
some
days
in
each
but
that
with
the
above
preparation
took
the
lead
and
was
by
far
the
best
crop
on
the
ground
this
is
an
experiment
worth
attending
to
it
is
usual
to
prepare
wheat
in
a
similar
way
but
no
other
grain
that
i
have
ever
heard
of
the
gray
used
to
be
the
only
one
considered
sufficiently
hardy
for
culture
in
the
fields
but
since
the
improvement
in
our
agriculture
we
have
all
the
finer
varieties
cultivated
in
large
quantities
the
seed
used
is
about
two
bushels
and
a
half
per
acre
and
the
produce
varies
from
three
to
ten
quarters
the
varieties
of
peas
are
many
but
the
principal
ones
used
in
agriculture
are
the
early
charlton
pea
the
dwarf
marrow
the
prussian
blue
all
these
are
dwarf
kinds
and
as
the
demand
for
this
article
in
time
of
war
is
great
for
the
navy
and
army
if
the
farmer
land
will
suit
and
produce
such
as
will
boil
they
will
fetch
a
considerably
greater
price
in
proportion
the
varieties
that
are
found
to
boil
are
either
used
whole
or
split
which
is
done
by
steeping
them
in
water
till
the
cotyledons
swell
after
which
they
are
dried
on
a
kiln

passed
through
a

polygonum
fagopyrum
this
is
usually
sown
in
places
where
pheasants

birds
it
is
also
useful
for

and
it
is
often
sown
on
foul

in
the
summer
as
it
grows
very
thick
on
the

and
helps
to
clean
it
by
smothering
all
the
weeds
the

more
than
ten
or
twelve
weeks
secale
cereale
this
is
often
grown
for
a
spring
crop
of
green
food
by
sowing
it
early
in
the
autumn
as
it
is
very
hardy
and
is
not
affected
by
frost
it
grows
fast
in
the
spring
months
and
affords
a
very
luxuriant
crop
of
green
fodder
tares
and
rye
are
frequently
sown
mixed
together
for
the
same
purpose
and
the
tares
find
a
support
in
the
stalks
of
the
rye
by
which
means
they
produce
a
larger
crop
than
they
make
by
themselves
the
grain
is
the
next
in
estimation
to
wheat
and
is
frequently
used
for
making
bread
the
quantity
sown
per

is
the

as

sinapis

this
is
grown
in

in
great
quantities
for

of
mustard
and
is
considered
better
flavoured
stronger
and
capable
of
keeping
better
than
the

for
such
purpose
it
is
also
in
use
for
various
medicinal
preparations

about
two
bushels

been
used
to
be
bruised
in
a
mortar
and
eaten
sometimes
as
a
condiment
but
only
in
small
quantities
when
used
fresh
it
is
weak
and
has
an
unpleasant
taste
but
after
standing
a
few
hours
the
essential
oil
unites
with
the
water
which
is
used
and
it
then
becomes
considerably
stronger
and
the
flavour
is
improved
it
is
prepared
by
drying
the
seeds
on
a
kiln
and
grinding
them
to
a
powder
as
this
article
is
become
of
considerable
importance
from
the
demand
it
has
occasioned
persons
to
speculate
in
its
adulteration
which
is
now
i
believe
often
practised
real

will
bear
the
addition

ages
this
species
was
introduced
some
years
ago
from
the
barbary
coast
and
has
been
found
very
beneficial
for
sowing
in
the
spring
when
it
often
produces
a
large
crop
it
takes
a
shorter
time
to
come
to
maturity
than
the
other
sorts
and
as
it
is
a
more
profitable
crop
to
the
farmer
on
good
soils
than
barley
it
is
frequently
sown
after
turnips
are
over
this
has
perhaps
been
one
of
the
best
improvements
in
grain
husbandry
that
was
ever
introduced
as
it
gives
the
grower
great
advantages
which
he
could
not
have
under
the
common
culture
of
wheat
at
the
usual
this
is
little
different
in
appearance
from
the
common
white
wheat
but
there
was
a
small
variety
of
it
with
rounder
grains
sent
to
the
board
of
agriculture
from
the
cape
of
good
hope
about
the
year
of
which
i
saved
a
small
quantity
of
seeds
which
was
distributed
among
the
members
and
i
have
lately
seen
a
sample
of
it
in
the
hands
of
a
gentleman
in
devonshire
who
speaks
very
highly
of
it
as
producing
a
large
crop
in
a
short
time
and
that
the
flower
was
so
much
esteemed
that
the
millers
gave
him
a
higher
price
for
it
than
the
finest
samples
at
market
of
the
other
kinds
would
sell
for
i
believe
this
variety
is
very
scarce
it
is
now
twelve
years
since
i
grew
it
from
which
what
i
saw

all
other

any

are

sprung
triticum
compositum
egyptian
this
is
a
species
with
branched
ears
and
commonly
having
as
many
as
three
and
four
divisions
it
is
much
cultivated
in
the
eastern
countries
but
has
not
been
found
to
answer
so
well
in
this
country
as
the
common
cultivated
species
triticum
hybernum
common
of
this
grain
we
have
a
number
of
varieties
which
are
grown
according
to
the
fashion
of
countries
differing
in
the
colour
of
the
ear
and
also
of
the
grain
the
most
esteemed
sorts
are
the
hertfordshire
white
and
the
essex
red
wheat
which
are
both
much
cultivated
and
equally
esteemed
the
season
for
growing
these
kinds
is
usually
september
and
october

and
modes
are

used

to

the

varies
accordingly
as
does

the
quantity
of

pecks
to

bushels

wheat
is
liable
to
the
ravages
of
many
terrestrious
insects
which
attack
its
roots
and
also
some
very
curious
diseases
one
of
these
has
been
very
clearly
elucidated
by
our
munificent
patron
of
science
sir
joseph
banks
in
the
investigation
of
a
parasitical
plant
which
destroys
the
blood
of
the
stalk
and
leaves
renders
the
grain
thin
and
in
some
cases
quite
destroys
the
crop
which
has
done
that
gentleman
penetration
great
credit
footnote
sir
joseph
banks
on
the
blight
in
an
equally
extraordinary
disease
is
the
smut
which
converts
the
farinaceous
parts
of
the
grain
to
a
black
powder
resembling
smut
a
cirumstance
too
well
known
to
many
farmers
those
who
wish
to
consult
the
remedies
recommended
against
this
may
refer
to
the
annals
of
agriculture
and
most
other
books
on
the
subject
it
is
usual
with
farmers
to
mix
the
wheat
with
stale
urine
or
brine
and
to
dry
it
by
sifting
it
with
slaked
lime
which
has
the
effect
of
causing
it
to
vegetate
quickly
and
to
prevent
the
attacks
of
many
insects
when
the
seed
is
first
put
into
the
ground
this
is
considered
as
productive
of
great
benefit
to
the
crop
but
it
is
also
to
be
remarked
that
it
is
almost
the
only
grain
that
is
ever
prepared
with
this
mixture
although
it
might
be
applied
with
equal
propriety
to
all
others

large
quantities
are
every

consumed
in

which
is
the
pure
fecula
of
the
grain
obtained
by
steeping
it
in

and
beating
it
in
coarse
hempen
bags
by
which
means
the
fecula

thus
caused
to
exude
and
diffuse
through
the
water
this
from
being
mixed
with
the
saccharine
matter
of
the

soon
runs
into
the

fermentation
and
the
weak
acid
thus
formed
by
digesting
on

starch
is
soluble
in

becomes
of

it
is

or
draw
a
parallel
betwixt
the
success
of
former
physicians
and
those
of
modern
times
all
that
concerns
us
to
remark
is
that
the
ancients
were
infinitely
more
indebted
to
the
vegetable
kingdom
for
the
materials
of
their
art
than
the
moderns
not
so
well
acquainted
with
the
oeconomy
of
nature
which
teaches
us
that
plants
were
chiefly
destined
for
the
food
of
various
animals
they
sought
in
every
herb
some
latent
healing
virtue
and
frequently
endeavoured
to
make
up
the
want
of
efficacy
in
one
by
the
combination
of
numbers
hence
the
extreme
length
of
their
farraginous
prescriptions
more
enlightened
ideas
of
the
operations
of
medicine
have
taught
the
moderns
greater
simplicity
and
conciseness
in
practice
perhaps
there
is
a
danger
that
this
simplicity
may
be
carried
to
far
and
become
finally
detrimental
to
the
practice
the
above
is
quoted
from
the
preface
to
a
catalogue
of
medicinal
plants
published
by
my
predecessor
in
and
it
may
be
observed
that
the
medical
student
has
at
the
present
season
a
still
less
number
of
plants
to
store
up
in
memory
owing
probably
to
the
great
advances
that
chemistry
has
made
in
the
mean
time
through
which
mineral
articles
in
many
instances
have
superseded
those
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
but
nevertheless
as
woodville
has
justly
observed
it
would
be
difficult
to
show
that
this
preference
is
supported
by
any
conclusive
reasoning
drawn
from
a
comparative
superiority
of
the
former
or
that
the
more
general
use
of
them
has
led
to
greater
success
in
the
practice
of
the
healing
art
it
is
however
evident
that
we
have
much
to
regret
the
almost
total
neglect
of
the
study
of
medical
botany
by
the
younger
branches
of
the
professors
of
physic

we
are
credibly
informed
that

it
is
therefore
high
time
that
those
persons
who
are
engaged
in
the
business
of
pharmacy
should
be
obliged
to
become
so
far
acquainted

distinguish
at

all
such
as
are
useful
in
diet
or
medicine
and
more
particularly
such
as
are
of
poisonous
qualities
the
medical
student
has
so
many
subjects
for
his
consideration
that
it
is
not
desirable
he
should
have
a
greater
number
of
vegetables
to
consult
than
are
necessary
and
we
can
not
help
lamenting
the
difficulty
he
has
to
struggle
with
in
consequence
of
the
great
difference
of
names
which
the
pharmacopoeias
of
the
present
day
exhibit
the
london
edinburgh
and
dublin
in
many
instances
enforce
the
necessity
of
learning
a
different
term
in
each
for
the
same
thing
and
none
of
which
are
called
by
the
same
they
were
twenty
years
ago
surely
it
would
be
the
means
of
forwarding
the
knowledge
of
drugs
if
each
could
be
distinguished
by
one
general
term
the
candidate
for
medical
knowledge
however
is
not
the
only
one
who
has
at
times
to
regret
this
confusion
of
names
the
linnaean
system
is
an
easy
and
delightful
path
to
the
knowledge
of
plants
but
like
all
other
human
structures
it
has
its
imperfections
and
some
of
which
have
been
modified
by
judicious
alterations
yet
the
teachers
of
this
science
as
well
as
the
students
have
often
to
deprecate
the
unnecessary
change
in
names
which
has
been
made
by
many
writers
in
many
cases
no
more
reason
appears
for
it
than
there
generally
would
be
to
change
christian
and
surnames
of
persons

those
which
although
they
have
been
expunged
are

such

modern

it
should
be
observed
that
writers
on
medical
plants
with
few
exceptions
have
copied
from
one
another
or
with
a
little
alteration
as
to
words
only
and
as
some
vegetables
from
their
affinitiy
may
be
confounded
with
others

those
possessing
medical
qualities
may
be
substituted

of

also
considerably
bitter
and
have
been
sometimes
used
for
the

purposes
as
the

tops
this
is
justly
esteemed
to
be
the
most
efficacious
bitter
of
all
the
medicinal
plants
indigenous
to
this
country
it
has
been
recommended
as
a
substitute
for
gentian
and
by
several
thought
to
be
a
more
useful
medicine
experiments
have
also
shown
it
to
possess
an
equal
degree
of
antiseptic
power
many
authors
have
observed
that
along
with
the
tonic
and
stomachic
qualities
of
a
bitter
centaury
frequently
proves
cathartic
but
it
is
possible
that
this
seldom
happens
unless
it
be
taken
in
very
large
doses
the
use
of
this
as
well
as
of
the
other
bitters
was
formerly
common
in
febrile
disorders
previous
to
the
knowledge
of
which
now
supersedes
them

diuretic
and
is
said
to
open
obstructions
of
the
viscera
and
remoter

without
heating
or
irritating
the
system
it
has
long
been
considered
as
the
most
effectual
of
all
the
antiscorbutic
plants
and
its
sensible
qualities
are
sufficiently
powerful
to
confirm
this
opinion
in
the

called
by

of

of

seems
to
extend
its
action
through

has
frequently
done
great
service
in

proceeding
from

said
not
that

the
mode
of
using
it
was
by
cutting
the
whole

up
after
drying

smoking
it
in
a
common
and
which
in

cases
in

given
great

by

an

medicine
not

in

even
in

probably
not
so

by

in

by

they
stand
recommended

doubtless
be

paid
attention
to
the
subject
described
in
the
foregoing
sections
will
be
struck
with
the
admirable
contrivance
of
divine
wisdom
that
has
caused
such
astringent
substances
as
are
contained
in
the
oak
and
peruvian
bark
to
be
produced
from
the
same
soil
and
in
a
similar
way
to
those
mucilaginous
and
laxative
ones
which
we
find
in
the
juice
of
the

the
olive
oil
it
is
not
intended
in
this
small
elementary
work
to
enter
into
any
investigation
of
the
primitive
parts
of
the
vegetable
creation
or
how
such
different
particles
are
secreted
it
may
therefore
suffice
that
although
the
science
of
vegetable
physiology
admits
of
many
very
beautiful
and
instructing
illustrations
yet
they
only
go
so
far
as
to
prove
to
us
that
the
first
and
grand
principle
of
vegetable
life
and
existence
as
well
as
of
the
formation
of
all
organic
substances
consists
in
a
system
of
attraction
and
combination
of
the
different
particles
of
nature
as
they
exist
and
are
imbibed
from
the
soil
and
the
surrounding
atmosphere
thus
during
their
existence
we
observe
a
continual
series
of
aggregation
of
substance
but
no
sooner
does
the
principle
of
life
become
extinct
than
the
agents
of
decomposition
are
at
work
dividing
and
selecting
each
different
substance
and
carrying
it
back
from
whence
it
came
from
dust
thou
comest
and
to
dust
thou
shalt
return
this
therefore
seems
to
be
the
sum
total
of
existence
the
explanation
of
which
with
all
its
interesting
ramifications
is
more
fully
explained
by
the
learned
professors
in
what
is
called
the
science
of
chemistry
as
plants
of
all
descriptions
and
their
several
parts
form
a
link
of
that
chain
by
which
the
welfare
of
the
universe
is
connected
the
industry
of
mankind
is
excited
to
preserve
them
for
the
different
purposes
to
which
they
are
applicable
in
the
oeconomy
of
human
existence
to
whose
use
the
greater
part
of
the
animal
and
vegetable
creation
appears
to
be
subservient
as
men
then
and
rational
beings
it
becomes
our
duty
so
to
manage
those
things
when
necessary
as
to
counteract
as
much
as
possible
the
decomposition
and
corruption
which
are
natural
to
all
organized
bodies
when
deprived
of
the
living
principle
we
find
that
some
vegetables
are
used
fresh
but
the
greater
part
are
preserved
in
a
dry
state
in
which
by
proper
management
they
can
be
kept
for
a
considerable
time
afterwards
both
for
our
own
use
as
well
as
for
that
of
others
who
reside
at
a
distance
from
the
place
of
their
production
in
the
preparation
of
the
parts
of
plants
for
medicinal
purposes
we
should
always
have
in
view
the
extreme
volatility
of
many
of
those
substances
and
how
necessary
it
therefore
is
that
the
mode
of
preparation
and
drying
should
be
done
as
quickly
as
possible
in
order
to
counteract
the
effects
of
the
air
and
light
which
continue
to
dissipate
without
intermission
these
particles
during
the
whole
time
that
any
vegetable
either
fresh
or
dried
is
left
to
its
influence
if
we
consider
the
nature
of
hops
which
i
shall
take
as
an
example
as
being
prepared
in
this
way
on
the
largest
scale
we
shall
find
they
consist
of
three
different
principles
namely
an
aroma
combined
with
an
agreeable
bitter
taste
and
a
yellow
colour
all
of
which
properties
are
by
the
consumers
and
dealers
therein
expected
to
exist
in
the
article
after
drying
the
art
of
drying
hops
therefore
has
been
a
subject
of
speculation
for
many
years
and
although
we
find
the
kiln
apparatus
for
preserving
them
differ
in
many
places
from
the
various
opinions
of
the
projectors
yet
they
are
all
intended
for
the
same
mode
of
action
the
producing
of
a
proper
degree
of
heat
which
must
be
regulated
according
to
the
state
of
the
atmosphere
at
the
gathering
season
and
the
consequent
quantity
of
the
watery
extract
that
the
hops
contain
at
the
time
thus
it
is
usual
to
have
two
kilns
of
different
temperatures
at
work
at
the
same
time
it
should
however
be
observed
that
the
principal
art
of
drying
hops
is
in
doing
it
as
quickly
as
possible
so
as
not
to
injure
them
in
their
colour
as
soon
as
they
are
dried
it
is
considered
necessary
to
put
them
up
into
close
and
thick
bags
it
should
be
observed
that
all
vegetables
contain
at
every
period
of
their
growth
two
distinct
species
of
moiture
the
one
called
by
naturalists
the
common
juice
which
is
the
ascending
sap
and
is
replete
with
watery
particles
the
other
is
termed
the
proper
juice
which
having
passed
up
through
the
leaves
and
being
there
concocted
and
deprived
of
the
watery
part
contains
the
principle
on
which
various
properties
and
virtues
of
the
plant
depend
we
therefore
find
that
the
operations
above
described
only
go
to
this
that
the
watery
particles
in
the
common
juice
should
be
evaporated
as
being
a
part
necessary
to
be
got
rid
of
and
the
proper
juice
being
of
a
volatile
nature
the
less
time
the
plants
are
exposed
for
that
purpose
the
less
of
this
precious
material
will
be
lost
and
as
those
parts
are
flying
off
continually
from
all
dried
vegetables
there
should
be
one
general
rule
made
with
regard
to
their
peparation
for
if
we
instance
mint
balm
pennyroyal
the
longer
these
are
kept
in
the
open
air
the
weaker
are
they
found
to
be
in
their
several
parts
from
hence
we
may
naturally
infer
that
the
usual
mode
in
which
the
generality
of
herbs
are
dried
is
not
so
good
for
the
purpose
as
one
would
be
if
contrived
on
similar
principles
as
during
the
length
of
time
necessary
for
the
purpose
a
great
deal
of
the
principal
parts
of
the
plants
must
of
course
be
evaporated
and
lost
for
little
else
is
regarded
than
to
dry
them
so
as
to
prevent
putrefaction
although
the
generality
of
herbs
met
with
are
prepared
as
above
described
yet
in
such
articles
as
digitalis
hyoscyamus
conium
toxicodendron
where
the
quantity
necessary
for
a
dose
is
so
small
and
so
much
depends
on
its
action
practitioners
are
often
obliged
to
prepare
it
themselves
i
shall
therefore
relate
the
following
mode
as
the
best
adapted
to
that
purpose
the
digitalis
is
prepared
by
collecting
the
leaves
in
the
summer
and
stripping
them
off
from
the
these
should
be
then
carefully
exposed
to
a
slow
heat
and
the
watery
extract
slowly
thrown
off
in
which
they
should
not
be
exposed
to
any
great
degree
of
heat
which
by
its
action
will
deprive
them
of
their
fine
green
colour
when
this
is
effected
the
whole
may
be
put
in
contact
with
a
heat
that
will
enable
the
operator
to
reduce
it
to
a
fine
powder
and
in
order
to
keep
it
with
its
virtues
perfect
it
will
be
necessary
to
deprive
it
as
much
as
possible
of
the
influence
of
air
and
light
hence
it
is
preserved
in
close
glass
bottles
which
are
coated
and
also
placed
in
a
dark
part
of
the
elaboratory
now
it
is
necessary
that
all
plants
intended
to
be
used
in
a
dried
state
should
be
prepared
and
protected
in
a
similar
manner
and
although
it
may
be
considered
as
a
superfluous
trouble
so
far
as
regards
the
more
common
kinds
particular
attention
should
be
paid
to
these
when
a
small
quantity
is
a
dose
and
an
a
certain
poison
other
kinds
of
vegetables
require
a
certain
degree
of
fermentation
as
tobacco
the
prinicpal
art
of
preserving
it
consists
in
this
operation
being
duly
performed
for
which
purpose
as
soon
as
the
leaves
of
the
herb
are
fit
the
are
broken
and
the
leaves
left
on
in
order
for
the
moisture
in
part
to
be
evaporated
afterwards
these
are
gathered
and
tied
in
handfuls
and
hung
up
in
the
shade
to
dry
and
when
sufficiently
divested
of
moisture
the
bundles
are
collected
together
and
laid
in
large
boxes
or
tubs
in
which
these
are
fermented
and
afterwards
taken
out
again
and
dried
when
it
is
found
fit
to
pack
up
for
the
market
the
properties
of
stramonium
which
has
been
so
much
recommended
for
curing
asthma
consist
pricipally
in
the
aroma
which
is
only
to
be
preserved
in
a
similar
manner
and
i
have
found
from
experience
that
if
the
leaves
are
separated
from
the
plant
in
a
manner
similar
to
that
of
tobacco
and
the
rest
of
the
plant
noth
roots
stalks
and
be
slit
and
sufficiently
dried
in
the
sun
or
in
an
oven
and
the
whole
fermented
together
a
very
different
article
is
the
produce
than
what
it
is
when
dried
in
the
usual
way
and
left
entirely
to
the
chance
influence
of
the
atmosphere
in
the
common
operation
of
it
may
also
be
observed
that
the
continued
turning
it
over
and
admitting
its
parts
to
the
action
of
the
sun
and
the
air
is
for
the
purpose
of
getting
rid
of
the
watery
particles
contained
in
it
and
the
quicker
this
is
done
the
better
it
is
and
although
this
operation
is
so
essentially
necessary
yet
care
should
be
taken
at
the
same
time
that
it
be
not
made
too
dry
so
as
to
prevent
a
due
degree
of
fermentation
being
allowed
to
take
place
in
the
rick
and
it
may
be
observed
that
the
best
grasses
or
other
plants
used
for
hay
if
made
too
dry
so
as
to
prevent
the
natural
fermentation
which
their
proper
juices
will
excite
can
never
make
either
palatable
or
nutritive
food
for
cattle
neither
can
the
same
be
effected
if
the
article
is
used
in
too
small
quantities
it
should
be
observed
that
herbs
of
all
kinds
should
be
gathered
for
peserving
when
in
full
bloom
but
when
roots
or
barks
are
recommended
these
should
be
collected
in
the
autumn
months
the
principles
laid
down
for
preserving
dried

section
i
have
confined
myself
principally
to
such
as
are
in
cultivation
there
are
many
of
our
indigenous
plants
which
in
times
of
scarcity
and
in
other
cases
of
necessity
are
used
as
food
by
the
people
in
the
neighbourhood
where
they
grow
but
of
these
i
shall
make
a
separate
list
artichoke
cynara
we
have
several
varieties
of
this
plant
in
cultivation
but
the
most
approved
are
the
large
green
and
the
globe
they
are
propagated
by
taking
off
the
young
suckers
from
the
old
roots
in
may
and
planting
them
in
a
piece
of
rich
land
artichokes
have
been
raised
from
seed
but
they
are
seldom
perfected
in
this
country
artichoke
jerusalem
helianthus

similar
to
the

but
they
are
not
generally
esteemed
asparagus
asparagus
a
very
delicious
vegetable
in
the

and
well
known
to
all
amateurs
of
gardening
there
is
a
variety
called
the
gravesend
asparagus
and
another
called
the
battersea
but
it
is
the
richness
of
the
soil
and
manure
that
makes
the
only
difference
basil

these
are
much
esteemed
of
dwarf

we
have
many
varieties
the
pollen
of
these
plants
is
very
apt
to
become
mixed
and
consequently
hybrid
kinds
differing
in
the
colour
of
the
seeds
are
often
produced
the
season
for
sowing
these
is
from

the
kind
most
esteemed
for
pickling
the
other
sorts
being
all

this
kind
is
the

is
cultivated
by
sowing
the
seeds
in

are
usually
kept
all

the
white
beet
is
only
a
variety
of
the

and
it
is
the

that
are
usually
eaten
of
this
kind

of
borecole
we
have
two
varieties
the
purple

the
former
is
in
much
esteem
amongst
the
germans
who
make
a
number
of
excellent
dishes
from
it
in
the
winter
the
culture
is
the

is
only
kept
as
an
ornamental

here
i
am
induced
to
notice
this
plant
as
i
have
known
some
things
used
in
mistake
for
capers
that
are
dangerous
i
once
saw
an
instance
of
this
in

many
varieties
cultivated
here
in
namely
yellow

red
of
various
shapes
as
long

and
all
these
are
very
useful
either
pickled
by
themselves
or
mixed
with
any
other
substances
as

which
they
impart

very
fine
warm
flavour

usually
sown
in
march

commonly
raised
on
the

likewise
be
sown
in

celery
apium
celery
is
now
so
generally
known
as
to
render
a
description
of
the
plant
useless
nor
need
it
be
told
that
the
stalks
blanched
are
eaten
raw
stewed
it
should
be
used
with
great
caution
if
grown
in
wet
land
as
it
has
been
considered
poisonous
in
such
cases
the
season
of
sowing
celery
is
in
april
we
have
a
variety
of
this
which
is
red
and
much
esteemed
celeriac
this
is
a
variety
of
the
apium
graveolens
it
is
hollow
in
the
stem
and
the
roots
are
particularly
large
although
this
is
much
used
in
germany
it
is
not
so
much
esteemed
by
us
as
the
celery
champignon
agaricus
this
plant
is
equal
in
flavour
to
the
mushroom
when
boiled
or
stewed
it
is
rather
dry
and
has
little
or
no
scent
whatever
chardoons
cynara
the
gardeners
blanch
the
stalks
as
they
do
celery
and
they
are
eaten
raw
with

and
vinegar
or
if
fancy
directs
they
are
also
either
boiled
or
stewed
chervil
scandix
this
plant
is
so
much
used
by
the
french

dutch
that
there
is
scarcely
a

brassica
oleracea
this
is
a
small
variety
of
the
common
cabbage
which
is
sown
in
june
and
planted
out
for
autumn

winter
use
these
are
often
found
to
stand
the
severe
frosts
of
our
winter
when
the
large
sort
of
cabbages
are
killed
but
its
principal
use
with
gardeners
is
to
have
a
crop
that
will
occupy
the
land
after
the
beans
and
pease
are
over
and
perhaps
colewort
is
the
most
advantageous

such
purposes

cress
american
erysimum
this
is
cultivated
for
salads
and
is
much
esteemed
it
is
increased
by
sowing
the

cucumbers
cucumis
many
sorts
of
cucumbers
are
cultivated
by
gardeners
the
most
esteemed
are
the
southgate
cucumber
the
long
prickly
the
long
turkey
the
white
spined
the
early
crop
is
usually
sown
in
in
the
spring
and
is
a
crop
on
which
most
gardeners
have
always
prided
themselves
each
on
his
best
mode
of
management
of
this
crop
they
will
also
grow
if
sown
in
april
and
planted
out
in
the
open
ground
the

prickly
cucumber
is
grown
for
gerkins
dill

we
have
three
varieties
in

are
sown
usually
in
june

winter
endive
is
well
known
as
forming
a
principal
part
of
our
winter
salads
for
which
purpose
it
is
usual
with
gardeners
to
blanch
it
by
tying
the
plants
up
together
and
laying
them
in
dry
places
eschalot
allium
this
species
of
allium
is
very
pungent
its
scent
is
not
unpleasant
but
is
very
strong
and
in
general
it
is
preferred
to
the
onion
for
making
soups
and
gravies
it
is
propagated
by
planting
the
bulbs
in
september
and

they
are

the
use
of
this
plant
is
so
well

this
is
used
in
the

it
is
a
good
substitute
for

kohlrabbi
or
cabbage
brassica
rapa
we
have
two
kinds
of
this
in
cultivation
but
although
these
are
both
much
eaten
in
germany
they
are
not
esteemed
with
us
in
fact
we
have
so
many
varieties
of
the
cabbage
kind
all
the
year
round
for
culinary
purposes
that
nothing
could
much
improve
them
in
countries
further
north
than
we
are
this
is
probably
an
acquisition
as
from
its
hardiness
it
is
likely
to
stand
the
frost
better
than
some
of
the
more
delicate
varieties
leeks

they
partake
much
of
the
nature
of
onions
but
for
this
purpose
are
in
general
more
esteemed
this
plant
has
been
so
long
cultivated
in
this
country
that
its
native

solanum
the
portuguese

are
so
very
fond
of
this
fruit
that
there
is
not
a

in
and
it
is
deemed
cooling
and

it
is
also
called

this
is
also
used
for
the

mushroom
agaricus
is
cultivated
and
well
known
at
our
tables
for
its
fine
taste
and
utility
in
sauces
these
plants
do
not
produce
seeds
that
can
be
saved
they
are
therefore
cultivated
by
collecting
the
spawn
which
is
found
in
old
and
in
meadow
lands
various
methods
have
been
lately
devised
for
raising
mushrooms
artificially
but
none
seem
to
be
equal
to
those
raised
in
beds
as
is
described
in
all
our
books
of
gardening
raising
this
vegetable
in
close
rooms
by
fire
heat
has
been
found
to
produce
them
with
a
bad

and
they
are
not
considered
so
wholesome
as
those
grown
in
the
open

or
when
that
element
is
admitted
at
times
freely
to

are
remarkable
for
keeping
late
in

a
portion
of

it

in

in

the
inhabitants
use
the
pulp
with
some
acid
fruits
for
pastry
and
it
is
there
very
useful
it
is
also
sometimes
used
in
a

fare
which
is
usually
eaten
under
the
hedge
of

of
his
employment
is
often
accompanied
with
a
dried
onion
and
was
this
root
more
known
than
it
generally
is
it
would
yield
him
at
the
expense
of
with
a
little
labour
in
his
cottage
garden
an
equally
pleasant
and
more
useful
sauce
to
his
coarse
but
happy
meals
i
have
observed
many
instances
of
this
oeconomy
amongst
the
labouring
classes
in
my
youth

fear
it
is
not
quite
so
commonly
made

the
root
of

vegetable
is
a

accompaniment
to
the
loyal
and
standard
english
dishes
the
smoking
baron
and
the
roast
surloin
with
which
it
is
most
generally
esteemed
it
should
not
be
passed
unnoticed
here
that
this
very
grateful
and
wholesome
root
is
not
at
all
times
to
be
eaten
with
impunity
one
or
two
instances
of
its
deleterious
effects
have
been
witnessed
by
my
much
esteemed
friend
taylor
the
worthy
secretary
at
the
society
of
arts
and
which
he
has
communicated
to
me
i
shall
insert
his
own
words
particularly
as
it
may
be
the
means
of
preventing
the
botanical
student
from
falling
into
the
same
error
after
arriving
with
the
usual
good
appetite
from
his
recreative
task
of
herborizing
excursions
some
gentlemen
having
ordered
a
dinner
at
a
tavern
of
which
scraped
was
one
some
persons
in
company
took
a
small
quantity
and
dipping
it
in
salt
ate
of
it
these
were
soon
seized
with
a
suppression
of
urine
accompanied
with
inflammation
of
the
kidneys
which
shortly
after
proved
fatal
to
one
of
the
company
the
doctor
was
consulted
but
not
knowing
exactly
the
cause
of
the
complaint
of
course
was
at
a
loss
to
apply
a
remedy
in
time
but
another
circumstance
of
the
like
nature
having
come
under
his
notice
and
being
apprized
of
it
by
a
well
applied
corrective
medicine
he
recovered
the
patient
it
should
therefore
be
made
a
general
observation
under
such
circumstances
and
those
are
not
the
most
unpleasant
we
meet
with
in
our
researches
to
eat
on
an
empty
stomach

are
very
sweet
and
contain
a
large
quantity
of

the
former
is
an

particularly
in

where
it
has
long
been
gathered
and
eaten
by
the
inhabitants
thereabouts
it
was
used
also
to
be
cultivated
but
was
in
general
lost
to
our
gardens
till
my
late
partner
curtis
having
paid
a
visit
to
his
friend
wavell
at
barnstaple
found
it
at
that
gentleman
table
and
on
his
return
he
collected
some
seeds
and
planted
a
considerable
spot
of
ground
with
it
at
brompton
in
at
which
time
it
was
again
introduced
to
but
with
so
little
successs
that
no
person
was
found
to
purchase
it
and
consequently
the
crop
was
useless
this
celebrated
botanist
however
published
a
small
tract
on
its
uses
and
culture
which
met
with
a
considerable
sale
and
introduced
it
again
to
general
cultivation
the
seeds
should
be
sown
in
march
and
the
following
year
the
plants
are
fit
for
forming
plantations
when
they
should
be
put
out

three
feet
apart

is
blanched
either
by
placing
over
the

by
earthing
it
up

is
usually
done
with
celery
it
is
easily
forced
by
placing
hot

on
the
pots

is
brought
forward
in

from
thence

it
has
been
noticed

the
roots
of
this

are
very
similar
to

both
in

quality
they
are
rather

not
quite

the

use
the

the

of
the

have
more
acidity
in

than
the

although
not
in

it
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
early

it
is
propagated
in
the

mode
as
the
common

sorts
of
this
vegetable
are
cultivated
the
which
is

every

a
constant

the
prickly

is
not
so
quick
in

is
hardy
enough
to
stand
our

it
is
therefore
sown
in

truffles
lycoperdon
not
in

the
poor
people
in
this
country
find
it
worth
their
while
to
train
up
dogs
for
the
purpose
of
finding
them
which
by
having
some
frequently
laid
in
their
way
become
so
used
to
it
that
they
will
scrape
them
up
in
the
woods
hence
they
are
called
the
french
cooks
use
them
in
soups
in
the
same
manner
as
mushrooms
the
truffle
is
mostly
found
in
beech
woods
i
have
mentioned
this
because
it
is
very
generally
met
with
at
table

it
is
not
in

varieties
in

the
culture
and
uses
of
the
turnep
are
too
well
known
to
require
any
description
the
country
people
cut
a
raw
turnep
in
thin
slices
and
a
lemon
in
the
same
manner
and
by
placing
the
slices
alternately
with
between
each
the
juice
of
the
turnep
is
extracted
and
is
used
as
a
pleasant
and
good
remedy
in
obstinate
coughs
and
will
be
found
to
relieve
persons
thus
afflicted
if
taken
immediately
after
each
fit
although
this
is
one
of
the
remedies
my
young
medical
friends
may
be
led
to
despise
yet
i
would
nevertheless
advise
them
to
make
use
of
it
when
need
occasions
the
yellow
turnep
is
also
much
esteemed
as
a
vegetable
but
is
dry
and
very
different
in
taste
from
any
of
the
common
kinds
section
culinary
plants
not
in
cultivation
the
following
section
can
not
be
too
closely
studied
by
people
in
all
ranks
of
life
many
of
our
most
delicate
vegetables
are
found
growing
wild
and
in
times
of
scarcity
and
after
hard
winters
many
articles
of
this
department
will
be
found
highly
acceptable
to
all
and
the
condition
of
the
poorer
classes
would
be
bettered
by
a
more
intimate
knowledge
of
those
plants
in
fact
these
and
the
medicinal
plants
ought
to
be
known
to
every
one
and
in
order
to
facilitate
the
study
of
them
i
have
been
thus
particular
in
my
description
of
the
different
kinds
agaric
orange
agaricus
this
agaric
well
boiled
and
seasoned
with
pepper
and
salt
has
a
flavour
similar
to
that
of
a
roasted
muscle
in
this
way
the
french
in
general
make
use
of
it
it
is
in
high
perfection
about
september
and
is
chiefly
to
be
found
in
dry
woods
alexanders
smyrnium
if
the
poorer
people
were
aware
of
the
value
of
this
plant
which
is
now
quite
neglected
it
might
be
turned
to
good
account
as
an
article
of
food
and
that
in
all
likelihood
of
the
most
wholesome
kind
bryant
thinks
it
was
much
esteemed
by
the
monks
and
states
that
it
has
ever
since
the
destruction
of
the
abbeys
in
this
country
remained
in
many
places
growing
among
the
rubbish
hence
the
reason
of
its
being
found
wild
in
such
places
alexanders
smyrnium
is
said
that
the
leaves
and
stalks
boiled
are
more
pleasant
to
the
taste
than
the
other
kind
of
alexanders
arrowhead
sagittaria
the
roots
of
this
plant
are
said
to
be
very
similar
to
the
they
are
sometimes
dried
and
pounded
but
are
reported
to
have
an
acrid
unpleasant
taste
but
this
might
perhaps
be
got
rid
of
by
washing
the
powder
in
water
blackberry
rubus
the
berries
of
this
plant
are
well
known
in
the
country
but
if
too
many
be
eaten
they
are
apt
to
cause
swelling
in
the

sanguisorba
the
young

form
a

they
have
somewhat
the
flavour
of
cucumbers
butterwort
pinguicula
the
inhabitants
of

and
the
north

give
to

the
consistence
of
cream
by
pouring
it
warm
from
the

upon
the
leaves
of
this

and
then
instantly
straining
it
and
laying
it
aside
for
two
or
three
days
till
it
acquires
a
degree
of
acidity
this
milk
they
are
extremely
fond
of
and
once
made
they
need
not
repeat
the
use
of
the
leaves
as
above
for
a
spoonful
or
less
of
it
will
turn
another
quantity
of

so

rather
dry
yet
when
boiled
or
stewed
it
communicates
a
good
flavour
and
is
equal
to
the
common
mushroom
chantarelle
agaricus
this
agaric
when
broiled
with
pepper
and
salt
has
a
taste
very
similar
to
that
of
a
roasted
cockle
and
is
considered
by
the
french
a
great
delicacy
it
is
found
principally
in

wild
in
some
parts
of

has
nearly
the
shape
of

is
reckoned
in

it
grows
abundantly
a

onopordon
the
tender
stalks
of
this

peeled

boiled
are
by

which
is
not
agreeable
to
all
bryant
in
his
flora
diaetetica
says
that
the
bottoms
of
the
flowers
are
eaten
as
artichokes
heracleum
the
inhabitants
of
kamschatka
about
the
beginning
of
july
collect
the
of
the
radical
leaves
of
this
plant
and
after
peeling
off
the
rind
dry
them
separately
in
the
sun
and
then
tying
them
in
bundles
they
lay
them
up
carefully
in
the
shade
in
a
short
time
afterwards
these
dried
stalks
are
covered
over
with
a
yellow
saccharine
efflorescence
tasting
like
liquorice
and
in
this
state
they
are
eaten
as
a
delicacy
the
russians
not
content
with
eating
the
stalks
thus
prepared
contrive
to
get
a
very
intoxicating
spirit
from
them
by
first
fermenting
them
in
water
with
the
greater
bilberry
vaccinium
uliginosum
and
then
distilling
the
liquor
to
what
degree
of
strength
they
please
which
gmelin
says
is
more
agreeable
to
the
taste
than
spirits
made
from
corn
this
may
therefore
prove
a
good
succedaneum
for
whisky
and
prevent
the
consumption
of
much

to
be
applied

better
purposes

as
a

dewberry

the
dewberry
is
very
apt
to
be
mistaken
for
the

but
it
may
be
easily
distinguished
by
its
fruit
being
not
so
large
and
being
covered
with

similar
to

is
no
department

of
vegetables
in
which
we
are
more
at
a
loss
than
in
the
knowledge
of
their
colouring
principles
and
as
this
subject
presents
to
the
student
an
opportunity
of
making
many
interesting
and
useful
experiments
i
trust
i
shall
stand
excused
if
i
enter
more
fully
into
the
nature
of
it
than
i
have
found
it
necessary
to
do
in
some
of
the
former
sections
the
following
list
of
plants
which
is
given
as
containing
colours
of
different
kinds
are
the
same
as
have
been
so
considered
for
many
years
past
for
latterly
little
has
been
added
to
our
stock
of
knowledge
on
this
head
it
may
however
be
proper
to
observe
that
a
great
number
of
vegetables
still
contain
this
principle
in
a
superior
degree
and
only
want
the
proper
attention
paid
to
the
abstracting
it
most
of
our
dyeing
drugs
are
from
abroad
and
even
the
culture
of
madder
which
was
once
so
much
grown
by
our
farmers
is
now
lost
to
us
to
the
great
advantage
of
the
dutch
who
supply
our
markets
but
there
is
no
reason
why
the
agriculturist
or
the
artisan
should
be
so
much
beholden
to
a
neighbouring
nation
as
to
pay
them
enormous
prices
for
articles
which
can
be
so
readily
raised
at
home
and
according
to
the
general
report
of
the
consumers
managed
in
a
way
far
superior
to
what
it
generally
is
when
imported
let
the
botanical
student
therefore
pay
attention
to
this
particular
for
it
is
a
wide
field
in
which
great
advantages
may
be
reaped
either
in
this
country
or
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
where
he
may
hereafter
become
an
inhabitant
the
art
of
dyeing
generally
considered
is
kept
so
great
a
secret
that
few
persons
have
had
the
opportunity
of
making
experiments
the
extracting
colours
from
their
primitive
basis
is
a
chemical
operation
and
can
not
be
expected
in
this
place
but
as
some
persons
may
be
inclined
to
ascertain
these
properties
of
vegetables
i
shall
go
just
so
far
into
the
subject
as
to
give
an
idea
of
the
modes
generally
used
and
to
state
the
principles
on
which
the
colouring
property
is
fixed
when
applied
to
the
purposes
of
dyeing
cloth
in
the
article
madder
page
i
mentioned
having
made
an
extract
similar
to
the
adrianople
red
for
which
purpose
a
sufficient
quanitity
of
the
roots
should
be
taken
fresh
out
of
the
ground
washed
clean
from
the
dirt
bruised
in
a
mortar
and
then
boiled
in
till
the
whole
becomes
tinged
of
a
red
colour
then
put
into
a
cloth
and
all
the
colouring
matter
pressed
out
this
should
again
be
put
into
hot
water
in
a
clean
glazed
to
which
should
be
added
a
small
quantity
of
water
in
which
alum
had
been
dissolved
and
the
whole
stirred
up
together
then
immediately
add
a
lump
of
soda
or
stirring
the
whole
up
when
an
effervescence
will
take
place
the
allum
that
had
united
with
the
juice
of
the
madder
will
be
found
to
become
neutralized
by
the
and
the
result
will
be
a
precipitate
of
the
red
fecula
this
may
be
washed
over
in
different
waters
and
either
put
by
for
use
in
a
liquid
state
or
filtered
and
dried
in
powder
or
cakes
most
vegetable
colours
will
not
however
admit
of
being
extracted
by
water
and
it
is
necessary
to
use
an
acid
for
that
purpose
vinegar
is
the
most
common
but
in
making
the
extract
from
roots
with
acids
great
care
should
be
taken
that
they
are
sufficiently
cleared
from
mould
sand
for
if
the
same
should
contain
either
iron
or
any
metallic
substance
its
union
with
the
acid
will
cause
a
blackness
and
of
course
spoil
the
tint
in
a
similar
mode
are
all
the
different
colouring
principles
extracted
either
from
leaves
flowers
fruits
or
woods

preparation
of

is
a
curious
process

similar
principles

is
then
managed
with

and
acids
agreeably
to
the
foregoing
rules
which
are
necessary
for
throwing
out
the
colour
instructions
how
substances
may
be
tried
whether
they
are
serviceable
in
dyeing
from
hopson
translation
of
weigleb
chemistry
in
order
to
discover
if
any
vegetable
contains
a
colouring
principle
fit
for
dyeing
it
should
be
bruised
and
boiled
in
water
and
a
bit
of
cotton
linen
or
woollen
stuff
which
has
previously
been
well
cleaned
boiled
in
this
decoction
for
a
certain
time
and
rinsed
out
and
dried
if
the
stuff
becomes
coloured
it
is
a
sign
that
the
colour
may
be
easily
extracted
but
if
little
or
no
colour
be
perceived
we
are
not
immediately
to
conclude
that
the
body
submitted
to
the
trial
has
no
colour
at
all
but
must
first
try
how
it
will
turn
out
with
the
addition
of
saline
substances
it
ought
therefore
to
be
boiled
with
common
salt
sal
ammoniac
tartar
vinegar
alum
or
vitriol
and
then
tried
upon
the
stuff
if
it
then
exhibit
no
colour
it
may
safely
be
pronounced
to
be
unfit
for
dyeing
with
but
if
it
yields
a
dye
or
colour
the
nature
of
this
dye
must
then
be
more
closely
examined
which
may
be
done
in
the
following
manner
let
a
saturated
decoction
of
the
colouring
substance
be
well
clarified
distributed
into
different
glass
vessels
and
its
natural
colour
observed
then
to
one
portion
of
it
let
there
be
added
a
solution
of
common
salt
to
the
second
some
sal
ammoniac
and
to
the
third
alum
to
the
fourth
to
the
fifth
vitriolic
or
marine
acid
and
to
the
sixth
some
green
vitriol
and
the
mixtures
be
suffered
to
stand
undisturbed
for
the
space
of
hours
now
in
each
of
these
mixtures
the
change
of
colour
is
to
be
observed
as
likewise
whether
it
yields
a
precipitate
or
not
if
the
precipitate
by
the
pure
acid
dissolve
in
an
alkaline
lixivium
entirely
and
with
a
colour
they
may
be
considered
as
mucilaginous
particles
in
which
the
tingeing
property
of
the
body
must
be
looked
for
which
in
its
natural
state
subsists
in
an
compound
but
if
the
precipitate
be
only
partly
dissolved
in
this
manner
the
dissolved
part
will
then
be
of
the
nature
of
a
resinous
mucilage
which
in
the
operation
has
left
the
more
earthy
parts
behind
but
if
nothing
be
precipitated
by
the
acids
and
the
colour
of
the
decoction
is
rendered
brighter
it
is
a
mark
of
an
compound
which
can
not
be
separated
by
acids
in
this
there
are
mostly
commonly
more
earthy
parts
which
are
soon
made
to
appear
by
the
addition
of
an
alkali
when
in
the
instances
in
which
green
vitriol
has
been
added
a
black
precipitate
is
produced
it
indicates
an
astringent
earthy
compound
in
which
there
are
few
mucilaginous
particles
the
more
the
colour
verges
to
black
the
more
of
this
acid
and
mucilaginous
substance
will
be
found
in
it
the
mixture
of
alum
with
a
tingeing
decoction
shows
by
the
coloured
precipitate
that
ensues
from
it
on
the
one
hand
the
colour
it
yields
and
on
the
other
hand
by
the
precipitate
dissolving
either
partly
or
entirely
in
a
strong
alkaline
lixivium
whether
or
not
some
of
the
earth
of
alum
has
been
precipitated
together
with
the
colouring
particles
such
substances
as
these
must
not
in
general
be
boiled
with
alum
although
this
latter
ingredient
may
be
very
properly
used
in
the
preparation
of
the
stuff
when
a
tingeing
decoction
is
precipitated
by
an
alkaline
lixivium
and
the
precipitate
is
not
redissolved
by
any
acid
for
the
most
part
neither
one
nor
the
other
of
these
saline
substances
ought
to
be
used
but
the
neutral
salts
will
be
greatly
preferable
in
all
these
observations
that
are
made
with
respect
to
the
precipitation
effected
by
means
of
different
saline
substances
attention
must
be
paid
at
the
same
time
to
the
change
of
colour
which
ensues
in
order
to
discover
whether
the
colour
brightens
or
entirely
changes
when
the
colour
of
a
decoction
is
darkened
by
the
additions
without
becoming
turbid
it
shows
that
the
colouring
matter
is
more
concentrated
and
inspissated
when
the
colour
is
brightened
a
greater
degree
of
solution
and
attenuation
has
taken
place
in
the
colouring
matter
in
consequence
of
the
addition
if
the
colour
becomes
clearer
and
after
a
little
time
some
of
the
tingeing
substance
is
separated
it
shows
that
part
of
the
colour
is
developed
but
that
another
part
has
been
set
loose
from
its
combination
by
the
saline
substance
but
if
the
colouring
matter
is
separated
in
great
abundance
by
the
saline
addition
the
colour
being
brightened
at
the
same
time
it
may
be
considered
as
a
sign
that
the
colouring
substance
is
entirely
separated
from
the
decoction
and
that
only
an
inconsiderable
part
of
a
gummy
nature
remains
behind
united
with
the
additaments
which
is
in
a
very
diluted
this
is
an
effect
of
the
solution
of
tin
as
also
sometimes
of
the
pure
acids
if
indeed
a
portion
of
the
colouring
substance
be
separated
by
a
saline
addition
but
the
rest
of
the
colouring
decoction
becomes
darker
it
shows
that
the
rest
of
the
colouring
particles
have
been
more
concentrated
and
hence
have
acquired
a
greater
power
of
tingeing
with
regard
to
the
proportion
of
the
addition
the
following
circumstances
may
serve
by
way
of
guide
when
the
colour
of
a
decoction
is
darkened
by
the
addition
without
any
precipitate
being
produced
no
detriment
can
easily
arise
from
using
a
redundancy
of
it
because
the
colour
will
not
be
further
darkened
by
it
but
if
the
colour
be
required
to
be
brighter
the
trial
must
first
be
made
which
is
the
proportion
by
which
the
colour
is
darkened
the
most
and
then
less
of
it
must
be
employed
when
the
colour
of
a
decoction
is
brightened
by
an
addition
without
a
precipitation
ensuing
this
addition
can
never
be
used
in
a
larger
quantity
without
hurting
the
colouring
particles
because
the
colouring
particles
would
be
made
too
light
and
almost
entirely
such
is
the
consequence
of
too
large
an
addition
of
the
solution
of
tin
or
of
a
pure
acid
when
the
addition
produces
a
brighter
colour
and
part
only
of
the
colouring
substance
is
separated
without
a
further
addition
occasioning
a
fresh
separation
somewhat
more
of
it
than
what
is
wanted
may
be
added
to
produce
the
requisite
shading
because
experience
shows
that
by
this
means
a
greater
quantity
of
tingeing
particles
is
united
with
the
woolly
fibres
of
the
cloth
and
is
capable
of
being
as
it
were
concentrated
in
them
for
which
purpose
however
these
barks
must
be
boiled
down
this
effect
is
chiefly
observed
with
sal
ammoniac
and
wine
vinegar
when
by
an
addition
which
causes
a
separation
of
the
colouring
substance
the
colour
becomes
brighter
in
proportion
the
more
there
is
used
of
it
it
must
be
employed
in
a
moderate
quantity
only
because
otherwise
more
and
more
of
the
colouring
substance
will
be
separated
and
its
tingeing
power
diminished
but
when
a
colour
is
rendered
dark
at
first
by
an
addition
and
afterwards
upon
more
of
the
same
substance
being
added
becomes
brighter
and
this
in
proportion
to
the
quantity
that
is
added
it
will
be
found
that
the
darkening
power
has
its
determined
limits
and
that
for
producing
the
requisite
degree
of
darkness
neither
too
much
nor
too
little
must
be
taken
to
the
principles
also
the
different
proofs
bear
a
reference
by
which
the
fixity
and
durability
of
the
colour
with
which
a
stuff
has
been
dyed
may
be
tried
of
these
some
may
be
called
natural
other
artificial
the
natural
proof
consists
in
exposing
the
dyed
stuff
to
the
air
sun
and
rain
if
the
colour
is
not
changed
by
this
exposure
in
twelve
or
fourteen
days
it
may
be
considered
as
genuine
but
if
it
is
the
contrary
is
allowed
this
proof
however
is
not
adapted
to
every
colour
because
some
of
them
resist
it
and
yet
will
fade
in
consequence
of
the
application
of
certain
acids
others
on
the
contrary
that
can
not
resist
the
natural
proof
remain
unchanged
by
the
latter
colours
therefore
may
be
arranged
in
three
classes
and
to
each
of
these
a
particular
kind
of
artificial
proof
allotted
the
first
class
is
tried
with
alum
the
second
with
soap
and
the
third
with
tartar
for
the
proof
with
alum
half
an
ounce
of
this
is
dissolved
in
one
pound
of
boiling
water
in
an
earthenware
vessel
into
this
is
put
for
instance
a
drachm
of
yarn
or
worsted
or
a
piece
of
cloth
of
about
two
fingers
breadth
this
is
suffered
to
boil
for
the
space
of
five
minutes
and
is
then
washed
in
clean
water
in
this
manner
are
tried
crimson
scarlet
violet
ponceau
colour
different
shades
of
blue
and
other
colours
bordring
upon
these
for
the
proof
with
soap
two
drachms
of
this
substance
are
boiled
in
a
pint
of
water
and
the
small
piece
of
dyed
stuff
that
is
to
be
tried
is
put
into
it
and
likewise
suffered
to
boil
for
the
space
of
five
minutes
with
this
all
sorts
of
yellow
green
cinnamon
and
similar
colours
are
tried
in
the
same
manner
is
made
the
proof
with
tartar
only
this
should
be
previously
pounded
very
small
in
order
that
it
may
be
more
easily
dissolved
with
this
all
colours
bordering
upon
the
fawn
are
tried
from
the
above
we
discover
that
the
art
of
applying
and
fixing
colours
in
dyeing
depends
on
the
chemical
affinity
between
the
cloth
and
the
dyeing
principle
and
accordingly
as
this
is
more
or
less
strong
so
is
the
facility
with
which
the
substance
is
coloured
and
on
this
the
deepness
of
the
dye
depends
for
frequently
one
kind
of
cloth
will
be
found
to
receive
no
colour
at
all
whilst
another
will
receive
from
the
same
composition
a
deep
tinge
cotton
for
instance
receives
scarcely
any
tinge
from
the
same
bath
that
will
dye
woollen
a
deep
scarlet
wool
is
that
which
appears
to
have
the
strongest
affinity
to
colouring
matter
next
to
it
is
silk
then
linen
and
cotton
the
weakest
and
is
therefore
the
most
difficult
of
all
to
dye
perfectly
thus
if
a
piece
of
linen
cloth
be
dipped
into
a
solution
of
madder
it
will
come
out
just
tinged
with
the
colour
but
if
a
piece
of
the
same
be
previously
dipped
into
a
solution
of
alum
or
copperas
and
dried
previously
to
being
dipped
in
the
madder
the
alum
will
become
so
far
impregnated
with
the
colouring
principle
that
the
cloth
will
receive
a
perfect
dye
and
be
so
fixed
that
it
can
not
be
separated
by
any
common
means
thus
it
will
be
observed
that
the
art
of
dyeing
permanent
colours
depends
on
this
intermediate
principle
which
is
termed
a
mordant
these
mordants
are
very
numerous
and
on
a
knowledge
of
them
appears
to
rest
the
principal
secret
of
dyeing
the
following
mode
is
however
a
very
convenient
one
for
makig
experiments
on
fixing
the
colouring
principles
of
any
vegetable
extract
to
have
several
pieces
of
cloth
woollen
cotton
silk
and
linen
dipped
in
the
different
mordants
and
by
keeping
a
small
vessel
filled
with
the
colouring
solution
on
a
fire
in
a
state
a
little
below
boiling
by
cutting
small
pieces
of
each
and
immersing
them
in
the
colour
and
examining
and
comparing
with
each
other
experiments
of
this
kind
are
well
worth
the
attention
of
persons
for
when
we
refer
to
this
department
we
shall
find
very
few
plants
which
are
either
now
or

been

purpose

i
have
found
it
necessary
to
be
particular
in
my
description
of
the
articles
in
this
section
as
i
find
that
although
the
knowledge
of
botany
has
in
some
measure
increased
yet
in
general
we
are
not
better
acquainted
with
the
poisonous
vegetables
than
we
were
thirty
years
ago
many
and
frequent
are
the
accidents
which
occur
in
consequence
of
mistakes
being
made
with
those
plants
but
it
in
general
happens
that
from
feelings
easily
appreciated
persons
do
not
like
to
detail
such
misfortunes
which
not
only
hides
the
mischief
but
prevents
in
a
great
measure
the
antidotes
becoming
so
well
known
as
for
the
good
of
society
we
could
wish
they
were
this
i
experienced
in
my
researches
after
several
facts
which
i
wished
to
ascertain
regarding
this
subject
however
whilst
we
have
in
common
use
such
plants
as
foxglove
hemlock
and
henbane
and
which
are
now
so
generally
sold
in
our
people
who
sell
them
ought
to
be
particularly
careful
not
to
let
such
fall
into
the
hands
of
ignorant
persons
and
thereby
be
administered
either
in
mistake
or
in
improper
quantities
our
druggists
and
apothecaries
are
careful
in
not
selling
to
strangers
the
more
common
preparations
of
mercury
or
arsenic
drugs
which
in
themselves
carry
fear
and
dismay
in
their
very
names
yet
we
can
get
any
poisonous
vegetables
either
in
the
common
market
or
of
which
are
more
likely
to
be
abused
in
their
application
than
other
poisons
which
are
of
not
more
dangerous
tendencies
the
effects
of
vegetable
poisons
on
the
human
frame
vary
according
to
circumstances
the
most
usual
are
that
of
disturbing
the
nervous
function
producing
vertigo
faintness
delirium
madness
stupor
or
apoplexy
with
a
consequent
loss
of
understanding
of
speech
and
of
all
the
senses
and
frequently
this
dreadful
scene
ends
in
death
in
a
short
period
it
is
however
fortunate
that
these
dangerous
plants
which
either
grow
wild
or
are
cultivated
in
this
country
are
few
in
number
and
it
is
not
less
so
that
the
most
virulent
often
carry
with
them
their
own
antidote
as
many
of
them
from
their
disagreeable
taste
produce
nausea
and
sickness
by
which
their
mischief
is
frequently
removed
and
when
this
is
not
the
case
it
points
out
that
the
best
and
most
effectual
one
is
the
application
of
emetics
and
it
may
be
almost
considered
a
divine
dispensation
that
a
plant
very
common
in
all
watery
places
should
be
ready
at
hand

has
from
experience
proved
one
of
the
most
active

after
the

the
effects
often
remain
by
part
of
the

qualities
being
absorbed
by
the

it
often
happens

such
cases
that

be

all
cases
applied
as
soon
as
possible

before

assistance
is
procured

eleven
french
prisoners
had
the
liberty
of
walking
in
and
about
the
town
of
pembroke
three
of
them
being
in
the
fields
a
little
before
noon
found
and
dug
up
a
large
quantity
of
this
plant
with
its
roots
which
they
took
to
be
wild
celery
to
eat
with
their
bread
and
butter
for
dinner
after
washing
it
a
while
in
the
fields
they
all
three
ate
or
rather
tasted
of
the
roots
as
they
were
entering
the
town
without
any
previous
notice
of
sickness
at
the
stomach
or
disorder
in
the
head
one
of
them
was
seized
with
convulsions
the
other
two
ran
home
and
sent
a
surgeon
to
him
the
surgeon
first
endeavoured
to
bleed
and
then
to
vomit
him
but
those
endeavours
were
fruitless
and
the
soldier
died
in
a
very
short
time
ignorant
yet
of
the
cause
of
their
comrade
death
and
of
their
own
danger
they
gave
of
these
roots
to
the
other
eight
prisoners
who
all
ate
some
of
them
with
their
dinner
the
quantity
could
not
be
ascertained
a
few
minutes
after
the
remaining
two
who
gathered
the
plant
were
seized
in
the
same
manner
as
the
first
of
which
one
died
the
other
was
bled
and
a
vomit
forced
down
on
account
of
his
jaws
being
as
it
were
locked
together
this
operated
and
he
recovered
but
he
was
for
some
time
affected
with
a
giddiness
in
his
head
and
it
is
remarkable
that
he
was
neither
sick
nor
in
the
least
disordered
in
his
stomach
the
others
being
bled
and
vomited
immediately
were
secured
from
the
approach
of
any
bad
symptoms
upon
examination
of
the
plant
which
the
french
prisoners
mistook
for
wild
celery
howell
discovered
it
to
be
this
plant
which
grows
very
plentifully
in
the
neighbourhood
of
haverfordwest
although
the
above
account
which
wilmer
has
so
minutely
described
seems
well
attested
and
corroborated
by
the
above
gentleman
yet
i
was
informed
by
the
late
adams
comptroller
of
the
customs
at
pembroke
that
the
oenanthe
does
not
that
he
could
find
grow
in
that
part
of
the
country
but
that
what
the
above
unfortunate
french
officers
did
actually
eat
was
the
wild
celery
which
grows
plentifully
in
all
the
wet
places
near
that
town
i
take
the
liberty
of
mentioning
this
circumstance
as
it
will
serve
to
keep
in
mind
the
fact
that
celery
when
found
wild
and
growing
in
wet
places
shold
be
used
cautiously
it
being
in
such
situations
of
a
pernicious
tendency
for
such
whose
curiosity
may
lead
them
to
become
acquainted
with
the
oenanthe

cultivated
celery
differs
from
it
when
young
first
in
the
shape
and
size
of
its
roots
the
oenanthe
is
perennial
and
has
a
large
root
which
on
being
cut
is
observed
to
be
full
of
juice
which
exudes
in
form
of
globules
the
celery
on
the
contrary
has
roots
in
general
much
smaller
particularly
when
in
a
wild
state
the
leaves
of
celery
have
somewhat
the
same
flavour
but
are
smaller
the
nerves
on
the
lobes
of
the
leaves
are
also
very
prominent
and
somewhat
more
pointed
when
the
two
plants
are
in
bloom
a
more
conspicuous
difference
is
apparent
in
the
involucrum
and
seeds
the
character
of
which
should
be
consulted
it
may
be
mistaken
for
parsley
but
it
is
both
much
larger
in
foliage
and
higher
in
growth
it
is
also
different
from
it
in
the
shape
of
the
roots
these
are
the
two
plants
most
likely
to
be
confounded
with
it
but
the
student
should
also
consult
the
difference
existing
between
this
plant
and
the
following
which
although
somewhat
alike
in
appearance
may
be
confounded

of
the
peach
or
apricot
they
communicate
an
agreeable
flavour
to
aqueous
and
spirituous
fluids
either
by
infusion
or
distillation
the
distilled
water
applied
to
the
organs
of
smelling
strongly
impresses
the
mind
with
the
same
ideas
as
arise
from
the
taste
of
peach
blossoms
or
apricot
kernels
it
is
so
extremely
deleterious
in
its
nature
and
sometimes
so
sudden
in
its
operation
as
to
occasion
instantaneous
death
but
it
more
frequently
happens
that
epileptic
symptoms
are
first
produced
this
poison
was
discovered
by
accident
in
ireland
in
the
year
before
which
it
was
no
uncommon
practice
there
to
add
a
certain
quantity
of
laurel
water
to
brandy
or
other
spirituous
liquors
to
render
them
agreeable
to
the
palate
at
that
time
three
women
drank
some
and
one
of
them
a
short
time
afterwards
became
violently
disordered
lost
her
speech
and
died
in
about
an
hour
a
gentleman
at
guildford
some
few
years
back
also
by
making
an
experiment
as
he
intended
on
himself
was
poisoned
by
a
small
dose
he
did
not
survive
the
taking
it
more
than
two
hours
in
consequence
of
the
above
poisonous
principle
existing
in
the
laurel
it
has
been
recommended
to
persons
to
be
cautious
hwo
they
make
use
of
the
leaves
of
that
shrub
which
is
a
usual
practice
with
cooks
for
giving
flavour
to
custards
and
other
lest
the
narcotic
principle
should
be
also
conveyed
to
the
detriment
of
the
health
of
persons
who
eat
of
them
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
kernels
of
all
for
the
flavours
given
to
noyau
ratafia
and
other
liquors
which
are
highly
prized
by
epicures
are
all
of
them
derived
from
the
same
principle
as
and
which
on
chemical
investigation
is
found
to
be
prussic
acid
this
exists
in
considerable
quantities
in
the
bitter
almond
and
which
when
separated
proves
to
be
the
most
active
poison
known
to
the
human
as
well
as
all
other
animal
existence
this
principle
and
its
mode
of
extraction
should
not
be
made
more
public
than
the
necessity
of
scientific
research
requires
we
can
not
with
propriety
accuse
either
this
tree
or
the
laurel
as
being
poisonous
because
the
ingenuity
of
mankind
has
found
out
a
mode
of
extracting
this
active
acidulous
principle
and
which
is
so
very
small
in
proportion
to
the
wholesome
properties
of
the
fruit
as
not
to
be
suspected
of
any
danger
but
for
this
discovery
as
well
might
we
accuse
wheat
of
being
poisonous
because
it
yields
on
distillation
brandy
which
has
been
known
to
kill
many
a
fellow
who
has
indulged
in
this
favourite
beverage
to
excess
an
eminent
chemist
informs
me
that
he
has
made
experiments
with
the
oxalic
acid
and
found
that
when
this
was
also
concentrated
it
has
similar
effects
insomuch
that
no
animal
can
contain
a
grain
of
it
if
taken
into
the
throat
or
stomach
and
thus
might
we
also
be
led
to
consider
the
elegant
and
in
itself
harmless
as
a
poisonous
plant
acrid
poisons
these
should
be
attacked
by
strong
decoctions
of
and
peruvian
bark
after
which
soft
mucilaginous
matters
should
be
used
as
milk

blue
this
is
a
very
poisonous
plant
and
many
instances
have
been
adduced
of
its
dangerous
effects
it
has
probably
obtained
the
name
of
wolfsbane
from
a
tradition
that
wolves
in
searching
for
particular
roots
which
they
in
part
subsist
upon
in
winter
frequently
make
a
mistake
and
eat
of
this
plant
which
proves
fatal
to
them
a
weaver
in
spitalfields
having
supped
upon
some
cold
meat
and
salad
was
suddenly
taken
ill
and
when
the
surgeon
employed
upon
this
occcasion
visited
him
he
found
him
in
the
following
situation
he
was
in
bed
with
his
head
supported
by
an
assistant
his
eyes
and
teeth
were
fixed
his
nostrils
compressed
his
hands
feet
and
forehead
cold
no
pulse
to
be
perceived
his
respiration
short
interrupted
and
laborious
soon
after
he
had
eaten
of
the
above
he
complained
of
a
sensation
of
heat
affecting
the
tongue
and
fauces
his
teeth
appeared
loose
and
it
was
very
remarkable
although
a
was
produced
and
his
friends
attempted
to
reason
him
out
of
the
extravagant
idea
yet
he
imagined
that
his
face
was
swelled
to
twice
its
usual
size
by
degrees
the
heat
wich
at
first
only
seemed
to
affect
the
mouth
and
adjacent
parts
diffused
itself
over
his
body
and
extremities
he
had
an
unsteadiness
and
lassitue
in
his
joints
particularly
of
the
knees
and
ancles
with
an
irritable
twitching
of
the
tendons
which
seemed
to
deprive
him
of
the
power
of
walking
and
he
thought
that
in
all
his
limbs
he
perceived
an
evident
interruption
to
the
circulation
of
the
blood
a
giddiness
was
the
next
symptom
which
was
not
accompanied
with
nausea
his
eyes
became
watery
and
he
could
not
see
distinctly
a
kind
of
humming
noise
in
his
ears
continually
disturbed
him
until
he
was
reduced
to
the
state
of
insensibility
before

although
the
mischief
which
is
recited
above
occurred
from
the
root

been
purchased
at

i
do
not
know
of
any
vegetable
in

likely
to
be
confounded
with
this
it
might
by
chance
be
mistaken
for
the
smaller
tubers
of
jerusalem
artichoke
in
foliage
it
comes
near
to
the
other
species
of
aconitum
and
to
the
perennial
larkspurs
however
as
this
is
a
plant
much
grown
in
on
account
of
its
beautiful
blue
flowers
great
care
should
be
taken
not
to
use
any
roots
taken
from
such
places
that
can
not

ascertained

every

i
think
it
is
proper
that
all
the
species
should
be
considered
as
such
and
never
be
made
use
of
either
in
medicine
or
otherwise
without
great
care
in

administration
actaea

this
plant
is
also
considered
as
a
deadly
poison
but
we
have
no
authentical
accounts
of
its
mischievous
effects
although
parkinson
has
mentioned
it
in
these
words
the
inhabitants
of
all
the
mountaines
and
places
wheresoever
it
groweth
as
some
writers
say
do
generally
hold
it
to
be
a
most
dangerous
and
deadly
poison
both
to
man
and
beast
and
they
used
to
kill
the
wolves
herewith
very
speedily
this
is

as
often
to

when

great
care
should
certainly
be
taken

baron
haller
has
taken
a
great
deal
of
pains
to
collect
what
has
been
said
concerning
it
and
quotes
many
authorities
to
show
that
this
plant
has
been
productive
of
the
most
violent
symptoms
such
as
anxiety
hiccough
and
a
delirium
even
for
the
space
of
three
months
stupor
vomiting
convulsions
and
death
where
much
parsley
is
used
the
mistress
of
the
house
therefore
would
do
well
to
examine
the
herbs
previous
to
their
being
made
use
of
but
the
best
precaution
will
be
always
to
sow
that
variety
called
curled
parsley
which
can
not
be
mistaken
for
this
or
any
other
plant
we
might
also
observe
that
the
scent
is
strong
and
disagreeable
in
the
aethusa
but
this
property
either
in
the
plant
or
the
poison
is
not
at
all
times
to
be
trusted
in
cases
of
this
nature

is
related
by

who
was
desired
to
visit
two
children
at
newburn
in
scotland
who
the
preceding
day
had
swallowed
some
of
the
berries
of
the
deadly
nightshade
he
found
them
in
a
deplorable
situation
the
eldest
ten
years
of
age
was
delirious
in
bed
and
affected
with
convulsive
spasms
the
younger
was
not
in
a
much
better
condition
in
his
mother
arms
the
eyes
of
both
the
children
were
particularly
affected

appearances
accompanied
with
a
remarkable
kind
of

very
affecting
scene
the
symptoms
came
on
about
two
hours
after
they
had
eaten
the
berries
they
appeared
at
first
as
if
they
had
been
intoxicated
afterwards
lost
the
power
of
speaking
and
continued
the
whole
night
so
unruly
that
it
was
with

bad

of

of

which
occurred
in

is
mentioned
by
threlkeld
in
the
winter

some
men
working
in
a
garden
threw
up
some
roots
which
were
supposed
to
be
skirrets
and
those
were
cooked
for
dinner
about
two
hours
after
they
were
eaten
a
person
who
partook
of
them
was
taken
with
an
unusual
lassitude

accompanied

several
others
who
had
eaten
at
the
same
table
as
also
servants
who
had
partaken
were
subjected
to
the
like
influence
medical
assistance
being
at
hand
by
the
use
of
emetics
they
were
relieved
but
it
was
many
days
before
the
whole
of

had
recovered
from
those
dreadful

both
eaten

of

the
one
a

who
recovered
being
taken
ill

was
supposed
to
have
thrown
them
off

the
other
a
little

died
in
convulsions
the
next
morning
as
mothers
and
kindred
souls
do
not
like
names
to
be
made
public
in
these
cases
i
can
not
help
feeling
some
desire
to
suppress
a
publicity
of
a
fact
in
which
a
near
and
dear
relative
was
materially
interested
in
justice
however
to
the
public
i
must
mention
that
i
can
vouch
for
the
fact
and
trust
it
may
not
pass
without
notice
so
far
as
to
let
the

be
supposed
anything
but
wholesome

the
idea
of
skirrets
being
confounded
with
this
plant
is
i
think
erroneous
if
it
has
leaves
on
as
they
are
not
pinnated
and
very
different
from
it
when
the
hyoscyamus
is
in

it
has
flowers
of
an
uncommonly
disgusting
hue
the
scent
of
this

on
bruising
it

its
general
appearance
render
it
almost
impossible
that
any
one
should
mistake
it

the

of

however
be
mistaken

few
months

a

was
ill
of
a

complaint
and
the
apothecary
had
desired
the
nurse
to
procure
a
small
quantity
of
coltsfoot
and
make
it
a
little
tea
and
accordingly
the
good
woman
went
to
a
shop
in
london
where
she
procured
as
she
supposed
three
pennyworth
of
that
herb
and
made
a
decoction
of
which
she
gave
the
patient
a
a
few
minutes
after
which
she
found
symptoms
of
convulsions
make
their
appearance
and
sent
for
the
apothecary
but
who
unfortunately
was
so
totally
ignorant
of
botany
as
not
to
know
the
plant
but
supposing
it
to
be
coltsfoot
after
the
infant
died
took
his
leave
without
ay
remark
further
than
that
the
disorder
which
occasioned
its
death
had
arisen
from
some
accidental
and
unusual
cause
the
nurse
however
did
not
feel
perfectly
satisfied
of
this
fact
and
carried
the
remainder
of
the
herb
to
and
having
applied
there
for
information
was
referred
to

a
gentleman
who
had
from
his
botanical
researches
that

obtained

told

the

also
went
and
saw
the

done
that

here
was
certainly
a
striking

of

neglecting
so
far
the

not

it

taste
to

and
is
said
to
be
poisonous
to

this
grass
has
been
known
in

linnaeus
informs
us
that
the
horses
in

by
eating
of
this

are
seized
with
a
kind
of
palsy
which
he
supposes
is
brought
upon
them
not
so
much
by
any
noxious
qualities
in
the
plant
itself
as
by

noxious
in

annual
weeds
or
such
as
grow
wild
in
fields
and
that
do
not
produce
any
food
for

many
weeds
are
troublesome
to
the
farmer
amongst
his
crops
but
which
by
affording
a
little
fodder
at
some
season
or
other
in
some
degree
compensate
for
their
intrusion
but
as
the
following
are
not
of
this
description
they
ought
at
all
times
to
be
extirpated
for
it
should
be
recollected
that
the
space
occupied
by
such
a
plant
would
in
many
instances
afford
room
for
many
ears
of
wheat
the
following
are
annuals
and
chiefly
grow
among
arable
crops
as
corn
as
these
every
year
spring
up
from
seeds
it
is
a
very
difficult
matter
for
the
farmer
to
prevent
their
increase
especially
since
the
practice
of
fallowing
land
has
become
almost
obsolete
it
is
a
fact
worthy
notice
that
the
seeds
of
most
of
the
annual
weeds
will
lie
in
the
ground
for
many
years
if
they
happen
to
be
place
deep
so
that
all
land
is
more
or
less
impregnated
with
them
and
a
fresh
supply
is
produced
every
time
the
land
is
ploughed
it
is
therefore
proper
that
annual
weeds
of
every
description
should
be
prevented
as
much
as
possible
can
be
from
going
to
seed
for
one
year
crop
will
take
several
seasons
to
eradicate
the
only
effectual
mode
we
are
acquainted
with
of
getting
rid
of
annual
weeds
is
either
by
hoeing
them
up
when
young
or
by
cutting
the
plants
over
with
any
instrument
whilst
in
bloom
for
it
should
be
observed
that
those
never
spring
from
the
roots
if
cut
over
at
that
period
of
their
growth
which
oftentimes
may
be
easily
accomplished
i
once
observed
a
crop
of
burnet
in
which
bromus
secalius
lob
grass
was
growing
whose
spike
stood
a
considerable
height
above
the
crop
and
several
acres
of
which
a
boy
or
woman
might
have
cut
over
in
a
short
space
of
time
but
it
was
not
so
the
grass
seeds
and
burnet
were
suffered
to
ripen
together
and
no
means
could
be
devised
to
separate
the
two
when
threshed
for
this
reason
the
burnet
seeds
never
could
find
a
market
and
consequently
the
trouble
of
saving
it
as
well
as
the
crop
was
lost
to
the
grower
i
mention
this
as
an
instance
of
many
that
frequently
occur
how
many
times
do
we
see
with
crops
of
winter
tares
wild
oats
seeding
in
them
or
carduus
mutans
standing
so
high
above
those
crops
that
they
might
be
thus
extirpated
with
great
ease
it
may
be
observed
that
it
is
in
culture
of
this
nature
where
annual
seeds
multiply
a
regular
crop
of
wheat
will
by
its
thickness
on
the
ground
retard
their

the
following
are
such
as
are
perennial
and
are
of
the
most
troublesome
nature
being
xtremely
difficult
to
get
rid
of
in
consequence
of
their
creeping
roots
it
unfortunately
appens
that
where
the
land
is
the
most
worked
and
the
roots
the
more
broken
thereby
the
more
the
crop
of
weeds
increases
on
the
land
therefore
the
only
effectual
mode
of
extirpating
plants
of
this
nature
is
by
picking
out
the
roots
after
the
plough
or
by
digging
them
up
at
every
opportunity
by
some
proper
instrument
where
weeds
of
this
nature
occur
there
is
too
often
thought
to
be
more
labour
than
profit
in
their
extirpation
and
although
this
is
an
argument
of
some
propriety
where
a
farmer
is
tenant
at
will
or
where
his
strength
is
not
proportionate
to
the
land
yet
if
land
is
worth
any
thing
at
all
that
whatever
it
may
be
is
lost
if
it
is
suffered
thus
to
become
barren
and
as
prevention
is
in
most
cases
considered
preferable
to
cure
more
care
ought
to
be
taken
than
generally
is

as

the

enable
persons
to
discover
what
is
fit
for
their

loam
the
kind
best
adapted
to
the
purpose
of
growing
plants
is
of
a
moderately
close
texture
between
clay
and
sand
differing
from
the
former
in
want
of
tenacity
when
wet
and
not
becoming
hard
when
dry
nor
is
it
loose
and
dusty
like
the
latter
but
in
both
states
possesses
somewhat
of
a
saponaceous
quality
it
varies
in
colour
from
yellow
to
brown
and
is
commonly
found
in
old
pastures
it
may
also
be
remarked
that
where
any
perennial
species
of
clover
trifolium
are
found
wild
it
is
almost
a
certain
indication
of
a
fertile
loam
and
such
as
contains
the
proper
food
of
plants
in
abundance
is
frequently
found
on
waste
lands
where
heaths
ericae
are
produced
it
is
composed
of
decayed
vegetable
matter
and
white
sand
the
best
sort
is
light
when
dry
of
a
black
colour
and
easily
reduced
to
powder
care
should
be
taken
to
distinguish
it
from
peat
which
is
hard
when
dry
destitute
in
a
great
measure
of
the
sand
and
mostly
of
a
red
colour
this
contains
in
great
quantities
sulphureous
particles
and
mineral
oil
which
are
known
to
be
highly
destructive
to
vegetation
the
mould
formed
from
rotten
leaves
is
a
good
substitute
for
if
mixed
with
sand
and
is
often
made
use
of
for
the
same
purposes
these
earths
should
be
dug
from
the
surface
to
the
depth
of
a
few
inches
and
laid
in
heaps
that
the
roots
contained
therein
may
be
decomposed
and
before
they
are
used
should
be
passed
through
a
coarse
screen
particularly
if
intended

as
loam
has
been
found
to
contain
the
greatest
portion
of
the
real
pabulum
of

it
has
long
been
used
for
such
as
are
planted
in
pots
and
the
component
parts
of

of

two
in

in

have
had
more
than
one
object
in

being

to
put
in

such

as
were
ornamental

curious
at

to
insert
none
but
what
are
perfectly
hardy
yet
independently
of
this
to
make
it
sufficiently
general
to

to

who
might
wish
to

a
sufficient
number

in

not
to
be
distinguished

general

they
are
calculated
to
afford
the

the

for

so

that
i
have
known

mistake
this

for

it
is
unfortunate
for
the
amateurs
of
gardening
that
most
plants
of
this
tribe
are
difficult
of
propagation
and
are
not
of
easy
culture
i
have
sometimes
succeeded
with
this
and
other
species
by
the
following
method
to
take
up
the
roots
from
their
native
places
of
growth
as
early
as
they
can
be
found
and
then
procure
some
chalk
and
sift
it
through
a
fine
sieve
and
also
some
good
tenacious
loam
mix
both
in
equal
quantities
in
water
a
large
should
then
be
filled
with
some
rubble
of
chalk
about
one
third
deep
and
then
the
above
compost
over
it
placing
the
roots
in
the
centre
at
the
usual
depth
they
grew
before
as
the
water
drains
away
the
loam
and
chalk
will
become
fixed
closely
round
the
bulbs
and
they
will
remain
alive
and
grow
by
this
method
i
have
cultivated
these
plants
for
some
years
together
in
this
way
all
those
kinds
growing
in
chalk
may
be
made
to
grow
but
such
as
the
orchis
moryo
maculata
and
pyramidalis
may
be
grown
in

alone
planted
in

in
the
common

should
be
taken
that
the

in

they
are
planted
are

miscellaneous

beta
vulgaris
i
have
noticed
this
plant
before
both
as
to
its
culinary
uses
and
for
feeding
cattle
but
having
received
a
communication
from
a
friend
of
mine
who
resides
in
the
interior
of
russia
relative
to
his
establishment
for
extracting
sugar
from
this
root
i
can
not
omit
relating
it
here
as
it
appears
to
be
an
interesting
part
of
agricultural
oeconomy
i
have
here
two
extensive
fabrics
for
the
purpose
of
making
sugar
from
the
red
beet
and
we
find
that
it
yields
us
that
useful
article
in
great
abundance
from
every
quarter
of
the
root
eight
bushels
winchester
measure
i
obtain
ten
pounds
weight
of
good
brown
sugar
and
this
when
refined
produces
us
four
pounds
of
the
finest
clarified
lump
sugar
and
the
molasses
yield
good
brandy
on
distillation
this
is
not
all
for
while
we
are
now
working
the
article
the
cows
are
on
the
refuse
from
the
vats
after
mashing
and
those
animals
give
us
milk
in
abundance
and
the
butter
we
are
making
is
equal
to
any
that
is
made
in
the
summer
when
those
animals
are
foraging

best
meads
dashkoff
in
the
government
of
orel
miles
from
petersburgh
jan
the
above
account
which
is
so
extremely
flattering
may
no
doubt
lead
persons
to
imagine
that
the
culture
of
the
beet
for
the
same
purpose
in
this
country
might
be
found
to
answer
and
as
it
is
our
aim
in
this
little
work
to
give
the
best
information
on
these
subjects
without
prejudice
i
shall
beg
leave
to
make
use
of
the
following
observation
which
is
not
my
own
but
one
that
was
made
on
this
subject
by
a
russian
gentleman
whom
i
have
long
had
the
honour
of
enumerating
among
my
best
friends
and
who
is
not
less
distinguished
for
his
application
both
to
the
arts
and
oeconomy
than
he
is
for
his
professional
duties
and
his
readiness
at
all
times
to
communicate
information
for
the
general
good
the
land
where
the
beet
is
grown
is
of
an
excellent
quality
very
deep
and
fertile
and
such
as
will
grow
any
crop
for
a
series
of
years
without
manure
such
soils
are
seldom
found
in
this
country
but
what
may
be
cultivated
to
more
advantage
in
such
land
and
such
alone
will
this
vegetable
imbibe
a
large
quantity
of
the
saccharine
fluid
for
it
would
be
in
vain
to
look
for
it
in
such
beet
roots
as
have
been
grown
on
poor
land
made
rich
by
dint
of
manure
it
may
also
be
a
circumstance
worth
remarking
that
although
the
sugar
thus
obtained
is
very
good
for
common
use
it
by
no
means
answers
the
purpose
of
the
confectioner
as
it
is
not
fit
for
preserving
and
for
this
purpose
the
cane
sugar
alone
is
used
so
that
although
great
merit
may
attach
to
the
industry
of
a
person
who
in
times
of
scarcity
can
produce
such
an
useful
article
as
sugar
from
a
vegetable
so
easily
grown
yet
when
cane
sugar
can
be
imported
at
a
moderate
rate
it
will
always
supersede
the
use
of
the
other
pyrus
malus
the
this
useful
fruit
now
growing
so
much
to
decay
in
this
country
which
was
once
so
celebrated
for
its
produce
is
grown
in
great
perfection
in
all
the
northern
provinces
of
france
and
she
supplied
the
london
markets
with
apples
this
season
for
which
she
was
paid
upwards
of
and
can
most
likely
offer
us
good
cyder
on
moderate
terms
the
french
people
ever
alive
to
improvement
and
invention
having
discovered
a
mode
of
extracting
sugar
in
considerable
quantity
from
this
fruit
i
shall
transcribe
the
particulars
of
it
on
the
preparation
of
liquid
sugar
from
apples
or
pears
by
dubuc
ann
de
chim
vol
lxviii
several
establishments
have
been
made
in
the
south
of
france
for
making
sugar
from
grapes
it
is
therefore
desired
to
communicate
the
same
advantage
to
the
north
of
france
as
apples
and
pears
will
produce
sugar
whose
taste
is
equally
agreeable
as
that
of
grapes
and
equally
cheap
eight
quarts
of
the
full
ripe
juice
of
the
orange
apples
was
boiled
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
forty
grammes
of
powdered
chalk
added
to
it
and
the
boiling
continued
for
ten
minutes
longer
the
liquor
was
strained
twice
through
flannel
and
afterwards
reduced
by
boiling
to
one
half
of
its
former
bulk
and
the
operation
finished
by
a
slow
heat
until
a
thick
pellicle
rose
on
the
surface
and
a
quart
of
the
syrup
weighed
two
pounds
by
this
method
two
pounds
one
ounce
of
liquid
sugar
was
obtained
very
agreeable
in
flavour
and
which
sweetened
water
very
well
and
even
milk
without
curdling
it
eight
quarts
of
the
juice
of
apples
called
doux
levesque
yielded
by
the
same
process
two
pounds
twelve
ounces
of
liquid
sugar
eight
quarts
of
the
juice
of
the
sour
apples
called
blanc
mollet
yielded
two
pounds
ten
ounces
of
good
sugar
eight
quarts
of
the
juice
of
the
watery
apples
called
girard
yielded
two
pounds
and
a
half
chilogrammes
or
of
the
above
four
apples
yielded
nearly
pounds
of
juice
which
took
three
ounces
of
chalk
and
the
white
of
six
eggs
and
produced
more
than
six
pounds
of
excellent
liquid
sugar
in
order
to
do
without
the
white
of
eggs
twenty
pounds
of
the
juice
of
the
above
apples
were
saturated
with
eleven
drachms
of
chalk
and
repeatedly
strained
through
flannel
but
it
was
still
thick
and
disagreeable
to
the
taste
twelve
drachms
of
charcoal
powder
were
then
added
and
the
whole
boiled
for
about
ten
minutes
and
then
strained
through
flannel
it
was
then
clear
but
than
usual
however
it
produced
very
good
sugar
six
quarts
of
were
also
treated
with
seven
drachms
of
chalk
and
one
ounce
of
previously
washed
until
it
no
longer
coloured
the
water
with
the
same
effect
eight
quarts
of
apple
juice
of
several
different
kinds
and
in
different
stages
of
ripeness
of
which
was
still
sour
were
saturated
with
twelve
drachms
of
chalk
and
clarified
with
the
whites
of
six
eggs
some
malate
of
lime
was
deposited
in
small
crystals
towards
the
end
and
separated
by
passing
the
syrup
very
hot
through
the
flannel
very
near
two
pounds
of
sugar
were
obtained
ten
pounds
of
bruised
apples
similar
to
the
last
were
left
to
macerate
for
hours
and
four
quarts
of
the
juice
were
treated
with
five
drachms
of
chalk
and
the
white
of
an
egg
it
yielded
one
pound
six
ounces
of
liquid
sugar
so
that
the
maceration
had
been
of
service
pounds
of
the
pear
called
pillage
yielded
nine
quarts
of
juice
which
required
eighteen
drachms
of
chalk
and
the
whites
of
two
eggs
and
yielded
about
ounces
of
sugar
which
was
less
agreeable
to
the
taste
than
that
of
ripe
apples
six
quarts
of
juice
from
one
part
of
the
above
pears
and
two
of
ripe
apples
orange
and
girard
treated
with
eight
drachms
of
chalk
and
the
whites
of
two
eggs
yielded
ounces
of
very
sugar
superior
to
the
preceding
six
quarts
of
juice
of
an
equal
quantity
of
apples
and
pears
treated
with
ten
drachms
of
chalk
and
thirteen
of
prepared
charcoal
deposited
some
malate
of
lime
and
yielded
a
sugar
rather
darker
than
the
preceding
but
very
well
tasted
cadet
de
vaux
says
that
apple
juice
does
not
curdle
milk
and
that
a
small
quantity
of
chalk
added
to
it
destroys
some
part
of
the
saccharine
principle
but
eight
quarts
of
juice
from
ripe
apples
called
orange
which
was
evidently
acid
as
it
curdled
milk
and
reddened
infusion
of
turnsole
and
that
of

retrospect
vol
vi
the
distressed
state
of
our
orchards
in
the
cider
counties
has
lately
much
engaged
the
attention
of
all
persons
who
are
accustomed
to
travel
through
them
and
no
one
can
possibly
view
the
miserable
condition
of
the
trees
without
being
forcibly
struck
with
their
bad
appearance
the
principal
case
of
which
i
am
sorry
to
say
has

observations
on

lately
published
by
the
author
of
this
work
and
it
certainly
does
in
a
great
measure
tarnish
the
laurels
of
our
boasted
agriculturists
when
we
find
such
great
quantities
of
this
useful
fruit
produced
in
france
that
very
country
which
we
have
been
taught
to
believe
so
greatly
behind
us

the
general

this
plant
has
been
recommended
as
a
crop
for
feeding
cattle
and
is
stated
to
be
cultivated
for
that
purpose
in
some
parts
of
germany
and
flanders

i
believe
we
have
many
other
plants
better
calculated
for
the
purpose
here
viola
this
is
a
very
useful
plant
in
medicine

has
long
been
used

is
however
discarded

during
the
late
war
when
from
unfortunate
circumstances
and
misunderstandings
amongst
the
potentates
of
europe
the
commercial
intercourse
was
checked
great
speculations
were
made
among
the
people
to
discover
substitutes
for
such
articles
as
were
of
certain
demand
and
one
of
the
principal
was
of
course
the
article
hemp
which
although
it
can
be
partially
cultivated
in
this
country
is
a
plant
of
that
nature
that
we
should
find
the
article
at
a
most
enormous
price
were
we
dependent
on
our
own
supply
alone
the
great
growth
that
supplies
all
the
markets
in
the
world
is
russia
where
land
is
not
only
cheap
but
of
better
quality
than
here
but
with
which
country
we
were
once
unhappily
deprived
of
the
advantage
of
trade
this
caused
persons
to
seek
for
substitutes
and
i
once
saw
one
that
was
made
from
not
to
be
despised
but
it
is
probable
that
none
has
reached
so
high
in
perfection
as
that
produced
from
the
plant
above
named
a
person
has
grown
and
manufactured
this
article
in
canada
and
has
exhibited
some
samples
in
london
which
it
is
said
have
obtained
the
sanction
of

therefore
is
a

i
shall

is

desired
mow
the

when
it
is

but
should
a
greater
produce
of
inferior
quality
be
more
desirable
it
should
stand
until
the

the
contrary
obtains
in

frequently
in

upon
a
fit
of
cold
will
bleed
plentifully
