notes
on
domestic
architecture
if
building
many
houses
could
teach
us
to
build
them
well
surely
we
ought
to
excel
in
this
matter
never
was
there
such
a
people
in
other
countries
the
laws
interfere
or
customs
traditions
and
circumstances
as
strong
as
laws
either
capital
is
wanting
or
the
possession
of
land
or
there
are
already
houses
enough
if
a
man
inherit
a
house
he
is
not
likely
to
build
another
nor
if
he
inherit
nothing
but
a
place
in
an
inevitable
line
of
lifelong
toil
in
such
countries
houses
are
built
wholesale
by
capitalists
and
only
by
a
small
minority
for
themselves
and
where
the
man
inherits
no
house
he
at
least
inherits
the
traditional
pattern
of
one
or
the
nature
of
the
soil
decides
the
main
points
as
you
can
not
build
of
brick
where
there
is
no
clay
nor
of
wood
where
there
are
no
forests
but
here
every
man
builds
a
house
for
himself
and
every
one
freely
according
to
his
whims
many
materials
are
nearly
equally
cheap
and
all
styles
and
ways
of
building
equally
open
to
us
at
least
the
general
appearance
of
most
should
be
known
to
us
for
we
have
tried
nearly
all
our
public
opinion
is
singularly
impartial
and
cosmopolitan
or
perhaps
we
should
rather
say
knowing
and
unscrupulous
all
that
is
demanded
of
a
house
is
that
it
should
be
of
an
improved
style
or
at
least
something
different
nothing
will
excuse
it
if
and
hardly
anything
condemn
it
if
it
have
novelty
enough
and
this
latitude
is
not
confined
to
the
owner
scheme
of
his
house
but
extends
also
to
the
executive
department
in
other
countries
however
extravagant
your
fancy
you
are
brought
within
some
bounds
when
you
come
to
carry
it
out
for
the
architect
and
the
builder
have
been
trained
to
certain
rules
and
forms
and
these
will
enter
into
all
they
do
but
here
every
man
is
an
architect
who
can
handle
a
and
every
man
a
builder
who
can
use
a
plane
or
a
trowel
and
the
chances
are
that
the
owner
thinks
he
can
do
all
as
well
as
either
of
them
for
if
every
man
in
england
thinks
he
can
write
a
leading
article
much
more
every
yankee
thinks
he
can
build
a
house
never
was
such
freedom
from
the
rule
of
tradition
a
fair
field
and
no
favor
whatever
that
can
accomplish
we
shall
have
the
result
it
must
be
confessed
is
not
gratifying
for
if
you
sometimes
find
a
man
who
is
satisfied
with
his
own
house
yet
his
neighbors
sneer
at
it
and
he
at
his
neighbors
houses
and
even
with
himself
it
does
not
usually
wear
well
the
common
case
is
that
even
he
accepts
it
as
a
confessed
failure
or
at
best
a
compromise
and
if
he
does
not
confess
the
failure
for
association
pride
reconcile
one
to
much
the
house
confesses
it
for
what
else
but
failures
are
these
thin
wooden
or
cheap
brick
walls
temporarily
disguised
as
massive
stone
this
roof
leaking
from
the
retained
by
the
gothic
parapet
or
the
insufficient
slope
which
the
italian
style
demands
there
is
no
lack
of
endeavor
to
make
the
house
look
well
people
will
sacrifice
almost
anything
to
that
they
will
strive
their
chambers
into
the
roof
they
will
have
windows
where
they
do
not
want
them
or
leave
them
out
where
they
do
in
our
tropical
summers
they
will
endure
the
glare
and
heat
of
the
sun
rather
than
that
blinds
should
interfere
with
the
moulded
or
with
the
style
generally
they
will
break
up
the
outline
with
useless
and
expensive
irregularity
they
will
have
brackets
that
support
nothing
and
balconies
and
upon
which
no
one
ever
steps
after
the
carpenter
leaves
them
all
for
the
sake
of
pleasing
the
eye
and
all
this
without
any
real
and
lasting
success
with
a
success
indeed
that
seems
often
in
an
inverse
ratio
to
the
effort
if
a
man
have
a
to
build
or
a
in
the
woods
he
may
hit
upon
an
agreeable
outline
but
let
him
set
out
freely
and
with
all
deliberation
to
build
something
that
shall
be
beautiful
and
he
fails
not
that
the
failure
is
peculiar
at
all
to
us
in
europe
there
may
perhaps
be
less
bad
taste
though
i
am
not
sure
of
that
but
there
and
everywhere
i
think
the
memorable
houses
among
those
of
recent
date
are
not
those
carefully
elaborated
for
effect
the
premeditated
irregularity
of
the
english
gothic
the
trig
regularity
of
the
french
or
the
studied
rusticity
of
germany
but
such
as
seem
to
have
grown
of
themselves
out
of
the
place
where
they
stand
swiss
mexican
or
manila
italian
built
nobody
knows
when
or
by
whom
and
built
without
any
thought
of
attracting
attention
and
here
i
think
we
get
a
hint
as
to
the
reason
of
their
success
for
a
house
is
not
a
monument
that
it
should
seek
to
draw
attention
to
itself
but
the
of
men
upon
the
earth
and
it
must
show
itself
to
be
wholly
secondary
to
its
purpose
we
have
had
a
good
deal
of
exhortation
lately
now
getting
rather
wearisome
about
avoiding
pretence
in
architecture
and
that
we
should
let
things
show
for
what
they
are
the
avoidance
of
pretence
should
begin
farther
back
if
the
house
is
pretence
we
shall
not
help
it
by
frankness
of
treatment
in
details
the
house
is
the
sign
of
man
entering
into
possession
of
the
earth
a
houseless
savage
living
on
wild
game
and
accidental
fruits
is
an
alien
in
nature
or
a
minor
not
yet
come
to
his
estate
as
soon
as
he
begins
to
cultivate
the
soil
he
builds
him
a
house
no
longer
a
hut
or
a
cave
but
the
work
of
his
own
hands
and
as
permanent
as
his
tenure
of
the
cultivated
field
if
that
is
to
descend
to
his
children
the
house
must
be
so
built
as
to
endure
accordingly
it
is
the
material
expression
of
the
of
the
family
such
people
in
such
a
place
hence
the
requirement
of
fitness
for
its
use
and
of
harmony
with
its
surroundings
a
is
the
appropriate
dwelling
of
the
lumberer
in
the
woods
but
transplant
it
to
a
suburban
lawn
and
it
becomes
an
absurdity
and
a
double
absurdity
it
is
not
in
harmony
with
the
place
nor
fit
for
the
use
of
the
citizen
nothing
more
satisfactory
in
their
place
than
the
old
english
but
transfer
one
of
them
from
its
natural
atmosphere
and
surroundings
to
the
midst
of
one
of
our
raw
villages
or
bustling
cities
exposed
to
the
sudden
and
violent
changes
of
our
climate
the
open
timber
roof
admitting
the
heat
and
the
cold
and
the
stone
walls
bedewed
with
condensed
moisture
and
after
the
first
pleasant
impression
of
the
moment
is
over
there
is
left
only
a
painful
feeling
of
mimicry
not
to
be
removed
by
any
precision
of
copying
nor
by
the
feeble
attempts
at
ivy
in
the
corners
this
is
all
evident
enough
and
in
principle
generally
admitted
but
we
dodge
the
application
of
the
principle
because
we
are
not
ready
to
admit
to
ourselves
what
history
apart
from
any
reasoning
would
show
us
that
those
importations
are
failures
and
that
not
accidentally
in
these
particular
cases
leaving
the
hope
of
better
success
for
the
next
trial
but
necessarily
and
because
they
are
importations
all
good
architecture
must
be
the
gradual
growth
of
its
country
and
its
age
the
accumulation
of
men
experience
adding
and
leaving
out
from
generation
to
generation
the
air
of
permanence
and
stability
that
we
admire
in
it
must
be
gained
by
a
slow
and
solid
growth
it
is
the
product
not
of
any
one
man
skill
but
of
a
nation
and
its
type
accordingly
must
be
gradually
formed
but
in
this
as
in
everything
else
there
must
be
an
aim
and
one
persisted
in
else
no
experience
is
gained
a
mere
succession
of
generations
will
do
nothing
if
for
each
of
them
the
whole
problem
is
changed
the
man
of
can
not
profit
by
his
experience
in
the
building
of
his
house
if
his
culture
his
habits
his
associates
are
different
from
his
father
much
less
if
they
have
changed
since
his
own
youth
and
are
changing
from
year
to
year
he
will
not
imitate
he
will
not
forbear
to
alter
on
such
shifting
sands
no
enduring
structure
is
possible
but
only
a
tent
for
the
night
we
talk
of
the
laws
of
architecture
but
the
fundamental
law
of
all
and
one
that
is
sure
to
be
obeyed
is
that
the
dwelling
shall
typify
man
appropriation
of
the
earth
and
its
products
what
we
call
property
a
man
house
is
naturally
just
as
fixed
a
quantity
as
the
kind
and
the
amount
of
his
possessions
and
no
more
so
the
style
of
it
depending
on
the
inherited
ideas
of
the
class
to
which
he
belongs
will
be
as
formed
and
as
fixed
as
that
class
then
where
there
is
no
fixed
class
and
where
the
property
of
every
man
is
constantly
varying
our
quantity
will
be
just
so
variable
and
the
true
type
of
our
architecture
will
be
the
tent
of
the
variety
suited
to
the
climate
for
good
architecture
then
we
need
castes
in
society
and
fixed
ways
of
living
we
see
the
effect
in
the
old
parsonages
in
england
where
from
year
to
year
have
dwelt
men
of
the
same
class
education
income
tastes
and
circumstances
generally
and
so
bringing
from
generation
to
generation
nearly
the
same
requirements
with
the
unessential
changes
brought
in
from
time
to
time
by
new
wants
or
individual
fancies
here
and
there
putting
out
a
or
adding
a
wing
but
always
in
the
spirit
of
the
original
building
and
the
whole
getting
each
year
more
and
and
so
toned
into
more
complete
harmony
with
the
landscape
yet
still
living
and
expansive
it
may
be
said
that
the
result
is
here
a
partly
accidental
one
and
not
a
matter
of
art
but
domestic
architecture
is
only
a
fine
art
it
does
not
aim
at
a
beauty
of
the
monumental
kind
as
a
statue
a
triumphal
arch
or
even
a
temple
does
its
primary
aim
is
shelter
to
house
man
in
nature
and
it
forms
as
it
were
the
connecting
link
between
him
and
the
outward
world
its
results
therefore
are
partly
the
free
artistic
production
and
partly
retain
unmodified
their
material
character
in
the
image
carved
by
the
sculptor
the
stone
or
wood
used
derive
little
of
their
effect
from
the
original
material
the
important
character
is
that
imparted
to
them
by
his
skill
still
more
the
canvas
and
pigments
of
the
painter
but
in
architecture
the
wood
and
stone
still
fulfil
the
offices
of
covering
connecting
and
supporting
as
they
did
in
the
tree
and
the
quarry
and
their
physical
properties
play
an
essential
part
in
the
work
the
house
therefore
is
a
work
of
art
only
half
emancipated
from
nature
and
must
depend
on
nature
for
much
of
its
beauty
also
it
must
not
be
isolated
as
something
merely
to
be
looked
at
apart
from
its
position
and
its
material
use
the
common
mistake
in
our
houses
is
that
they
are
designed
as
inexperienced
persons
choose
their
to
be
something
of
themselves
and
not
as
mere
background
as
they
should
be
thus
it
is
that
people
seek
to
beautify
their
houses
by
ornamenting
them
as
a
vulgar
person
sticks
himself
over
with
jewelry
a
man
house
is
only
a
wider
kind
of
dress
and
as
we
do
not
call
a
man
when
we
are
forced
to
see
his
dress
before
we
see
him
so
a
house
can
not
be
satisfactory
when
it
isolates
itself
from
its
inmates
and
from
the
landscape
in
such
houses
the
more
the
worse
they
are
they
may
cheat
us
for
the
moment
but
the
oftener
we
see
them
the
less
we
like
them
does
not
the
uncomfortable
sensation
with
which
fine
houses
so
often
oppress
us
arise
from
the
vague
feeling
that
the
owner
has
built
himself
out
of
his
house
and
his
house
out
of
the
landscape
hence
it
is
mostly
the
novices
that
build
the
fine
houses
a
man
of
sense
i
think
will
generally
build
his
second
house
plainer
than
his
first
not
that
he
desires
perhaps
any
the
less
what
he
desired
before
but
he
is
more
alive
to
the
difficulties
and
to
the
cost
and
takes
refuge
in
the
safety
of
a
lower
scale
his
experience
has
taught
him
that
where
he
succeeded
best
he
was
really
farthest
from
the
end
he
sought
the
fine
house
requires
that
its
accessories
should
be
in
kind
all
things
within
and
without
the
approach
the
grounds
the
furniture
must
be
brought
up
to
the
same
pitch
and
kept
there
and
when
all
is
done
it
is
not
done
but
forever
demands
retouching
what
is
got
in
this
kind
can
not
be
paid
for
with
money
nor
finished
once
for
all
but
is
a
absorbent
of
time
thought
life
and
it
attacks
the
owner
too
he
must
conform
in
his
dress
his
equipage
and
his
habits
generally
he
must
be
as
fine
as
his
house
the
nicer
his
taste
the
more
any
incongruity
will
offend
him
and
the
greater
the
danger
of
his
becoming
more
or
less
an
appendage
to
his
house
much
of
that
chronic
ailment
of
our
society
the
trials
of
housekeeping
is
traceable
to
this
source
this
is
a
complicated
trouble
and
probably
other
causes
have
their
share
in
it
but
we
can
not
fail
to
recognize
in
these
seemingly
accidental
obstructions
a
stern
but
beneficent
adjustment
of
our
circumstances
to
enforce
a
simplicity
which
we
should
else
neglect
one
can
not
greatly
deprecate
the
terrors
of
high
rents
and
long
bills
and
the
sufferings
from
clumsy
and
careless
domestics
if
they
help
to
keep
down
senseless
profusion
and
display
our
problem
is
in
truth
one
of
greater
difficulty
than
at
first
appears
for
we
are
each
of
us
striving
to
do
by
the
skill
and
forethought
of
one
man
what
naturally
accomplishes
itself
in
a
succession
of
generations
and
with
the
aid
of
circumstances
it
is
from
our
freedom
that
the
trouble
arises
were
our
society
composed
of
few
classes
widely
and
permanently
distinct
a
fitting
style
for
each
would
naturally
arise
and
become
established
and
perfected
there
would
be
fewer
occasions
for
new
houses
and
the
new
house
would
be
less
novel
in
style
and
so
two
difficulties
would
be
overcome
for
novelty
of
style
is
a
drawback
to
effect
as
tending
to
isolate
the
house
and
a
new
house
is
always
at
a
disadvantage
nature
in
any
case
is
slow
to
adopt
our
handiwork
into
the
landscape
sometimes
the
assimilation
is
so
difficult
that
it
must
be
ruined
for
its
original
purpose
before
it
will
be
accepted
sooner
or
later
indeed
it
will
be
accepted
for
though
most
of
our
buildings
seem
even
in
decay
to
resist
the
harmonizing
hand
of
nature
and
to
grow
only
ghastly
and
not
venerable
in
dilapidation
yet
leave
them
long
enough
and
what
of
beauty
was
possible
to
them
will
appear
though
it
be
only
a
crumbling
heap
of
bricks
where
the
chimney
stood
or
the
grassy
slope
where
the
has
fallen
in
it
is
for
this
reason
that
persons
of
taste
have
taken
pains
to
face
their
houses
with
and
stone
or
invent
proper
names
for
them
in
imitation
of
the
english
but
nature
is
jealous
of
this
helping
and
neither
the
lichens
nor
the
names
will
stick
for
the
reason
that
they
never
grew
there
they
can
not
be
naturalized
without
naturalizing
their
conditions
the
gray
ancestral
houses
of
england
are
the
beautiful
symbols
of
the
permanence
of
family
and
of
caste
they
are
the
embodiments
of
traditional
institutions
and
culture
when
we
speak
of
the
house
of
stanley
or
of
howard
the
expression
is
not
wholly
figurative
we
do
not
mean
simply
the
men
and
women
of
these
families
but
the
whole
complex
of
this
manifold
environment
which
has
descended
to
them
and
in
the
midst
of
which
they
have
grown
up
no
more
to
be
separated
from
it
than
the
polyp
from
the
coral
stem
all
this
is
centralized
and
has
its
expression
in
the
house
now
as
these
conditions
are
not
our
conditions
the
attempt
to
build
fine
houses
is
an
attempt
to
import
an
effect
where
the
cause
has
not
existed
our
position
is
that
of
a
perpetually
shifting
population
the
mass
shifting
and
the
individuals
shifting
in
place
circumstances
requirements
the
movement
is
inevitable
and
whether
desirable
or
not
we
must
conform
to
it
so
we
naturally
build
cheaply
and
slightly
that
the
house
be
not
an
incumbrance
rather
than
a
furtherance
to
our
life
it
is
agreeable
to
the
feelings
to
be
well
rooted
and
established
and
the
results
in
outward
appearance
are
agreeable
but
it
is
not
desirable
to
be
so
niched
into
the
rock
that
a
change
of
fortune
or
even
a
change
in
the
direction
of
a
shall
leave
us
high
and
dry
like
the
fossils
of
the
norwegian
cliffs
but
rather
like
the
of
our
beaches
free
to
travel
up
and
down
with
the
tide
the
imitating
of
foreign
examples
comes
from
no
real
demand
but
only
from
a
fancied
or
simulated
demand
from
tradition
association
at
in
one
shape
or
another
it
is
at
bottom
something
of
the
same
flunkeyism
that
in
a
more
exaggerated
form
assumes
heraldic
bearings
and
puts
its
servants
into
livery
it
may
well
reconcile
us
to
our
deprivation
to
remember
at
what
cost
these
things
we
admire
are
established
and
kept
up
the
imagination
is
pleased
with
this
stability
but
it
is
bought
too
dear
if
progress
is
to
be
sacrificed
to
it
if
the
freedom
and
the
true
lives
of
the
members
are
to
be
merged
in
the
family
and
if
they
are
to
be
the
stones
of
which
the
house
is
built
it
is
not
desirable
to
be
whether
the
bonds
be
physical
or
only
moral
ones
we
may
well
be
content
to
have
our
limits
free
even
though
our
architecture
suffer
for
it
it
is
better
that
houses
should
belong
to
men
and
not
men
to
houses
but
whether
we
are
content
or
not
it
is
evident
that
all
hope
of
improvement
lies
in
the
tendency
somewhat
noticeable
of
late
to
the
abnegation
of
exotic
styles
and
graces
we
have
survived
the
parthenon
pattern
and
there
seems
to
be
a
prospect
that
we
shall
outlive
the
gothic
cottage
even
the
bracketed
villa
has
seen
its
palmiest
days
apparently
and
exhausted
most
of
its
variations
we
are
in
an
extremely
chaotic
state
just
now
but
there
seems
to
be
an
inclination
towards
more
rational
ways
at
least
in
the
plans
and
general
arrangement
of
houses
of
course
mere
negation
can
not
carry
us
far
we
sometimes
hear
it
said
that
it
is
as
easy
for
a
house
to
look
well
as
to
look
ill
and
those
who
say
this
seem
to
think
that
the
failure
is
due
solely
to
want
of
due
consideration
of
the
problem
on
the
part
of
our
builders
and
that
we
have
but
to
leave
out
their
blunders
to
get
at
a
satisfactory
result
but
if
we
look
at
the
facts
of
the
case
we
find
the
builders
have
some
reason
on
their
side
nothing
can
be
more
unsightly
than
the
stalky
staring
houses
of
our
villages
with
their
plain
of
a
pitch
neither
high
enough
nor
low
enough
for
beauty
and
disfigured
moreover
by
mere
excrescences
of
attic
windows
and
over
the
whole
structure
the
awkward
angularity
and
the
look
of
barren
mindless
conformity
and
uniformity
in
the
general
outlines
and
the
meagre
frittered
effect
inherent
in
the
material
but
when
we
come
to
build
we
find
that
the
blockheads
who
invented
this
style
or
have
got
at
the
cheapest
way
of
supplying
the
first
imperative
demands
of
the
people
for
whom
they
build
namely
to
be
walled
in
and
roofed
and
with
a
decent
neatness
but
without
much
care
that
the
house
should
be
solid
and
enduring
for
it
can
not
well
be
so
flimsy
as
not
to
outlast
the
owner
needs
he
does
not
look
to
it
as
the
habitation
of
his
children
hardly
as
his
own
for
his
lifetime
but
as
a
present
shelter
easily
and
quickly
got
ready
and
as
easily
plucked
up
and
carried
off
again
the
of
england
looks
upon
a
house
as
real
estate
as
part
of
the
soil
but
with
us
it
is
hardly
a
fixture
surely
nothing
can
be
more
simple
and
than
an
ordinary
new
england
house
but
at
the
same
time
nothing
can
be
uglier
the
outline
the
material
the
color
and
texture
of
the
surface
are
at
all
points
opposed
to
breadth
of
effect
or
harmony
with
the
surroundings
there
is
neither
mass
nor
elegance
there
are
no
lines
of
union
with
the
ground
the
meagre
monotony
of
the
lines
of
shingles
and
clapboards
making
subdivisions
too
small
to
be
impressive
and
too
large
to
be
overlooked
and
finally
the
paint
of
which
the
outside
really
consists
thrusting
forward
its
chalky
blankness
as
it
were
a
standing
defiance
of
all
possibility
of
assimilation
all
combine
to
form
something
that
shall
forever
remain
a
blot
in
the
landscape
evidently
it
is
not
merely
a
more
treatment
that
we
want
for
here
is
sufficient
simplicity
but
a
simplicity
barren
of
all
satisfaction
and
singularly
enough
it
seems
with
all
its
meagreness
to
pass
easily
into
an
ostentatious
display
in
these
houses
there
is
no
thought
of
architecture
that
is
considered
as
something
quite
apart
and
not
essential
to
the
of
the
house
but
for
this
very
reason
matters
are
not
much
changed
when
the
owner
determines
to
spend
something
for
looks
the
house
remains
at
bottom
the
same
rude
mass
with
the
architecture
tacked
on
it
is
not
that
the
owner
has
any
deeper
or
different
sentiment
towards
his
dwelling
but
merely
that
he
has
a
desire
to
make
a
flourish
before
the
eyes
of
beholders
there
is
no
heartfelt
interest
in
all
this
on
his
part
it
gives
him
no
pleasure
how
then
should
it
please
the
spectator
the
case
is
the
same
whether
it
be
the
coarse
ornamentation
of
the
cheap
cottage
or
the
work
of
the
fashionable
architect
we
feel
that
the
decoration
is
superficial
and
may
be
dispensed
with
and
then
however
skillful
it
becomes
superfluous
the
more
elaborate
the
worse
for
attention
is
the
more
drawn
to
the
failure
what
is
wanted
for
any
real
progress
is
not
so
much
a
greater
skill
in
our
as
more
thoughtful
consideration
on
the
part
of
the
of
what
truly
interests
them
in
the
house
we
do
not
stop
to
examine
what
really
weighs
with
us
but
on
some
fancied
necessity
hasten
to
do
superfluous
things
what
is
it
that
we
really
care
for
in
the
building
of
our
houses
is
it
not
that
like
dress
or
manners
they
should
facilitate
and
not
impede
the
business
of
life
we
do
not
wish
to
be
compelled
to
think
of
them
by
themselves
either
as
good
or
bad
but
to
get
rid
of
any
obstruction
from
them
they
are
to
be
lived
in
not
looked
at
and
their
beauty
must
grow
as
naturally
from
their
use
as
the
flower
from
its
stem
so
that
it
shall
not
be
possible
to
say
where
the
one
ends
and
the
other
begins
not
that
beauty
will
come
of
itself
there
must
be
the
feeling
to
be
satisfied
before
any
satisfaction
will
come
but
we
shall
not
help
it
by
pretending
the
feeling
nor
by
trying
to
persuade
others
or
ourselves
that
we
are
pleased
with
what
has
been
pleasing
to
other
nations
and
under
other
circumstances
our
poverty
if
poverty
it
be
is
not
disgraceful
until
we
attempt
to
conceal
it
by
our
affectation
of
foreign
airs
and
graces
maya
the
princess
the
sea
floated
its
upon
the
gray
shore
and
murmured
its
inarticulate
all
day
to
the
dumb
rocks
above
the
blue
sky
was
bordered
with
saffron
sunrises
pink
sunsets
silver
or
spangled
with
careless
stars
the
air
was
full
of
that
had
fluttered
the
hearts
of
a
thousand
roses
and
a
million
violets
with
long
deep
kisses
and
then
flung
the
delicate
odors
abroad
to
tell
their
exploits
and
set
the
butterflies
mad
with
jealousy
and
the
bees
crazy
with
avarice
and
all
this
bloom
was
upon
the
country
of
larrièrepensée
when
queen
lura
little
daughter
came
to
life
in
the
topaz
palace
that
stood
on
sunrise
hills
and
was
king
joconde
summer
pavilion
now
there
was
no
searching
far
and
wide
for
godfathers
godmothers
and
a
name
as
there
is
when
the
princesses
of
this
world
are
born
for
in
the
first
place
larrièrepensée
was
a
country
of
pious
heathen
and
full
of
fairies
the
people
worshipped
an
idea
and
invited
the
fairy
folk
to
all
their
parties
as
we
who
are
proper
here
invite
the
clergy
only
the
fairy
folk
did
not
get
behind
the
door
or
leave
the
room
when
dancing
commenced
and
the
reason
why
this
princess
was
born
to
a
name
as
well
as
to
a
kingdom
was
that
long
ago
the
people
who
kept
records
in
larrièrepensée
were
much
troubled
by
the
ladies
of
that
land
never
growing
old
they
staid
at
thirty
for
ten
years
at
forty
for
twenty
and
all
died
before
fifty
which
made
much
confusion
in
dates
especially
when
some
women
were
called
upon
to
tell
traditions
the
only
sort
of
history
endured
in
that
kingdom
because
it
was
against
the
law
to
write
either
lies
or
romances
though
you
might
hear
and
tell
them
if
you
would
and
some
people
would
although
to
call
a
man
a
historian
there
was
the
same
thing
as
to
say
you
lie
here
but
as
i
was
saying
this
evergreen
way
into
which
the
women
fell
caused
much
trouble
and
the
twelve
sages
made
a
law
that
for
six
hundred
years
every
female
child
born
in
any
month
of
the
hundred
following
should
be
named
by
the
name
ordained
for
that
month
and
then
they
made
a
long
list
containing
hundred
names
of
women
and
locked
it
up
in
the
box
of
great
designs
which
stood
always
under
the
king
throne
and
thenceforward
at
the
beginning
of
every
month
the
twelve
sages
unlocked
the
box
consulted
the
paper
and
sent
a
herald
through
the
town
to
proclaim
the
for
that
month
so
this
saved
a
world
of
trouble
for
if
some
wrinkled
old
maid
should
say
and
that
happened
long
ago
some
time
before
i
was
born
all
her
gossips
laughed
and
cried
out
ho
ho
there
a
historian
do
we
not
all
know
you
were
a
born
allia
ten
years
before
that
date
and
then
the
old
maid
was
put
to
shame
now
it
happened
well
for
queen
lura
lovely
daughter
that
on
her
was
written
the
gracious
name
of
maya
for
it
seemed
well
to
fit
her
grace
and
delicacy
while
but
few
in
that
country
knew
its
sad
oriental
depth
or
that
it
had
any
meaning
at
all
it
was
all
one
flush
of
dawn
upon
sunrise
hills
when
the
in
curls
and
white
frocks
began
to
strew
the
great
hall
of
amethyst
with
geranium
leaves
and
arrange
light
tripods
of
gold
for
the
fairies
who
were
that
day
gathered
from
all
larrièrepensée
to
see
and
gift
the
new
princess
the
queen
had
written
notes
to
them
on
spicy
and
now
the
and
the
wheeled
her
couch
of
state
into
the
hall
of
amethyst
that
she
might
receive
the
tender
wishes
of
the
good
fairies
while
yet
the
sweet
languor
of
her
motherhood
kept
her
from
the
fresh
wind
and
bright
dew
out
of
doors
the
couch
of
state
was
fashioned
like
a
great
rose
of
crimson
velvet
only
where
there
should
have
been
the
gold
anthers
of
the
flower
lay
the
lovely
queen
wrapped
in
a
mantle
of
down
and
nested
on
one
arm
slept
the
child
of
the
kingdom
maya
presently
a
cloud
of
swept
through
the
wide
windows
and
settling
upon
the
ceiling
began
a
murmurous
song
when
one
by
one
the
entered
and
flitting
to
their
tripods
each
garlanded
with
her
own
blossom
awaited
the
coming
of
their
head
the
fairy
cordis
as
the
queen
perceived
their
delay
a
sudden
pang
crossed
her
pale
and
tranquil
brow
ah
said
she
to
the
lita
my
poor
baby
maya
what
have
i
done
i
have
neglected
to
ask
the
fairy
anima
and
now
she
will
come
in
anger
and
give
my
child
an
evil
gift
unless
cordis
hastens
do
not
fear
madam
said
lita
your
nerves
are
weak
take
a
little
cordial
so
she
gave
the
queen
a
red
glass
full
of
honeybell
whiskey
but
she
called
it
a
fine
name
like
or
and
then
queen
lura
drank
it
down
nicely
so
much
depends
on
names
even
in
larrièrepensée
but
as
lita
set
away
the
glass
the
bees
upon
the
ceiling
began
to
buzz
in
a
most
angry
manner
and
rally
about
the
the
cried
round
the
palace
corner
and
a
strange
light
like
the
sun
shining
when
it
rains
threw
a
lurid
glow
over
the
graceful
fairy
forms
then
the
door
of
the
hall
flung
open
and
a
beautiful
wrathful
shape
crossed
the
threshold
it
was
the
fairy
anima
where
she
gathered
the
gauzes
that
made
her
rainbow
vest
or
the
that
gemmed
her
hair
or
the
cloud
of
purple
that
was
her
robe
no
fay
or
mortal
knew
but
they
knew
well
the
power
of
her
presence
and
grew
pale
at
her
anger
with
swift
feet
she
neared
the
couch
of
state
but
her
steps
lingered
as
she
saw
within
those
crimson
leaves
the
delicate
face
of
the
queen
and
her
sleeping
child
always
she
murmured
and
i
tread
the
winds
abroad
a
fair
bud
and
i
am
but
a
stately
stem
you
were
foolish
and
frail
queen
lura
that
you
sent
me
no
word
of
your
now
i
come
angry
show
me
the
child
lita
with
awed
steps
drew
near
and
lifted
the
baby
in
her
arms
and
the
child
soft
hazel
eyes
looked
with
grave
innocence
at
anima
truly
the
princess
was
a
lovely
piece
of
nature
her
hair
like
fine
silk
fell
in
dark
yet
gilded
tresses
from
her
brow
her
eyes
were
thoughtless
tender
serene
her
lips
red
as
the
heart
of
a
peach
her
skin
so
fair
that
it
seemed
stained
with
violets
where
the
blue
veins
crept
lovingly
beneath
and
her
dimpled
cheeks
were
flushed
with
sleep
like
the
sunset
sky
anima
looked
at
the
ah
too
much
too
much
said
she
queen
lura
a
butterfly
can
eat
honey
only
let
us
have
a
higher
life
for
the
princess
of
larrièrepensée
maya
i
give
thee
for
a
another
crown
receive
the
spark
queen
lura
shrieked
but
anima
stretching
out
her
wand
a
snake
of
black
diamonds
with
a
head
touched
the
child
eyes
and
from
the
serpent
rapid
tongue
a
spark
of
fire
darted
into
either
eye
and
sunk
deeper
and
deeper
for
two
tears
flowed
above
and
hung
on
maya
silky
lashes
as
she
looked
with
a
preternatural
expression
of
reproach
at
the
fairy
now
all
was
confusion
queen
lura
tried
to
faint
she
knew
it
was
proper
and
the
rang
all
the
palace
bells
in
a
row
anima
gave
no
glance
at
the
little
princess
who
still
sat
upright
in
lita
petrified
arms
but
went
proudly
from
the
hall
alone
the
dropped
their
wands
with
one
sonorous
clang
upon
the
floor
and
with
bitter
sighs
and
wringing
hands
flitted
one
after
another
to
the
portal
bewailing
as
they
went
their
wasted
gifts
and
powers
why
should
i
give
her
beauty
cried
the
fairy
rose
all
eyes
will
be
dazzled
with
the
spark
who
will
know
on
what
form
it
shines
so
the
red
rose
dropped
and
died
why
should
i
bring
her
innocence
said
the
fairy
lily
the
spark
will
burn
all
evil
from
her
thought
and
deed
then
the
white
lily
dropped
and
died
is
there
any
use
to
her
in
grace
wept
the
fairy
eglantine
the
spark
will
melt
away
all
mortal
grossness
till
she
is
light
and
graceful
as
the
clouds
above
and
the
eglantine
wreaths
dropped
and
died
she
will
never
want
humility
said
the
fairy
violet
for
she
will
find
too
soon
that
the
spark
is
a
curse
as
well
as
a
crown
so
the
violet
dropped
and
died
then
the
denied
her
pity
the
blue
not
constancy
the
iris
pride
the
gold
the
love
the
amaranth
hope
all
because
the
spark
should
gift
her
with
every
one
of
these
and
burn
the
gift
in
deeply
so
they
all
dropped
and
died
and
she
could
never
know
the
flowers
of
life
only
its
fires
but
in
the
end
of
all
this
flight
came
a
ray
of
consolation
like
the
star
that
heralds
dawn
springing
upward
on
the
skirt
of
blackest
hour
the
raging
bees
that
had
swarmed
upon
the
golden
chandelier
returned
to
the
ceiling
and
their
song
the
scattered
flowers
revived
and
scented
the
air
for
the
fairy
cordis
came
too
late
but
welcome
her
face
bright
with
flushes
of
vivid
but
uncertain
rose
her
deep
gray
eyes
brimming
with
motherhood
a
sister
fondness
and
the
ardor
of
a
child
the
tenderest
made
her
a
robe
full
of
little
common
flowers
and
in
her
hair
rested
a
light
circle
of
such
blooms
as
beguile
the
winter
days
of
the
poor
and
the
desolate
and
put
forth
their
sweetest
buds
by
the
garret
window
or
the
bedside
of
a
sick
man
lita
nearly
dropped
the
baby
in
her
great
relief
of
mind
but
cordis
caught
it
and
looked
at
its
brilliant
face
with
tears
ah
head
of
the
fairies
help
me
murmured
queen
lura
extending
her
arms
toward
cordis
for
she
had
kept
one
eye
open
wide
enough
to
see
what
would
happen
while
she
fainted
away
all
i
can
i
will
said
the
kindly
fairy
speaking
in
the
same
key
that
a
lark
sings
in
so
she
sat
down
upon
a
white
velvet
mushroom
and
fell
to
thinking
while
maya
the
princess
looked
at
her
from
the
rose
where
she
lay
and
the
queen
having
pushed
her
down
robe
safely
out
of
the
way
leaned
her
head
on
her
hand
and
very
properly
cried
as
much
as
six
tears
soon
like
a
sunbeam
cordis
looked
up
i
can
give
the
princess
a
queen
lura
said
she
but
it
is
not
sure
look
you
she
will
have
a
lonely
life
for
the
spark
burns
as
well
as
shines
and
the
only
way
to
mend
that
matter
is
to
give
the
fire
better
fuel
than
herself
for
some
long
years
yet
she
must
keep
herself
in
peace
and
the
shade
but
when
she
is
a
woman
and
the
spark
can
no
more
be
hidden
since
to
be
a
woman
is
to
have
power
and
pain
then
let
her
veil
herself
and
with
a
staff
and
scrip
go
abroad
into
the
world
for
her
time
is
come
now
in
this
kingdom
of
larrièrepensée
there
stand
many
houses
all
empty
but
swept
and
garnished
and
a
fire
laid
ready
on
the
hearth
for
the
hand
of
the
coming
to
kindle
but
sometimes
nay
often
this
fire
is
a
cheat
for
there
be
men
who
carve
the
semblance
of
it
in
stone
and
are
so
content
to
have
the
chill
for
the
blaze
all
their
lives
and
on
some
hearths
the
logs
are
green
wood
set
up
before
their
time
and
on
some
they
are
but
ashes
for
the
fire
has
burned
and
died
and
left
the
ghostly
shape
of
boughs
behind
and
sometimes
again
they
are
but
icicles
clothed
in
bark
to
save
the
shame
of
the
possessor
but
there
are
some
hearths
laid
with
dry
and
goodly
timber
and
if
the
princess
maya
does
not
fail
but
chooses
a
real
and
honest
heap
of
wood
and
kindles
it
from
the
spark
within
her
then
will
she
have
a
most
perfect
life
for
the
fire
that
consumes
her
shall
leave
its
evil
work
and
make
the
light
and
warmth
of
a
household
and
rescue
her
forever
from
the
accursed
crown
of
the
spark
but
i
grieve
to
tell
you
yet
one
of
my
name
can
not
lie
if
the
princess
mistake
the
false
for
the
true
if
she
flashes
her
fire
upon
stone
or
ice
or
embers
either
the
spark
will
recoil
and
burn
her
to
ashes
or
it
will
die
where
she
placed
it
and
turn
her
to
stone
or
worst
fate
of
all
yet
likeliest
to
befall
the
tenderest
and
best
it
will
reenter
her
at
her
lips
and
turn
her
whole
nature
to
the
bitterness
of
gall
so
that
neither
food
shall
refresh
her
sleep
rest
her
water
quench
her
thirst
nor
fire
warm
her
body
is
it
worth
the
trial
or
shall
she
live
and
burn
slowly
to
her
death
with
the
unquenchable
fire
of
the
spark
ah
let
her
at
the
least
try
for
that
perfect
life
said
queen
lura
then
the
fairy
cordis
drew
from
her
delicate
finger
a
ring
of
twisted
gold
in
which
was
set
an
opal
wrought
into
the
shape
of
a
heart
and
in
it
palpitated
like
throbbing
blood
one
scarlet
flash
of
flame
let
her
keep
this
always
on
her
hand
said
cordis
it
will
serve
to
test
the
truth
of
the
fire
she
strives
to
kindle
for
if
it
be
not
true
wood
this
heart
will
grow
cold
the
throb
cease
the
glow
become
dim
the
talisman
may
will
save
her
unless
in
the
madness
of
joy
she
forget
to
ask
its
aid
or
the
spark
flashing
upon
its
surface
seems
to
create
anew
the
fire
within
and
thus
deceives
her
so
the
fairy
put
the
ring
upon
queen
lura
hand
and
kissed
fair
brow
already
shaded
with
sleep
the
bees
upon
the
ceiling
followed
her
dropping
honey
as
they
went
the
wheeled
away
the
couch
of
state
the
swept
up
the
fading
leaves
and
blossoms
drew
the
curtains
down
fastened
the
great
door
with
a
bar
sprinkled
the
corridors
with
rosewater
and
by
moonrise
when
the
nightingales
sung
loud
from
the
laurel
thickets
all
the
country
slept
even
maya
but
the
spark
burned
bright
and
she
dreamed
so
the
night
came
on
and
many
another
night
and
many
a
new
day
till
maya
grown
a
girl
looked
onward
to
the
life
before
her
with
strange
foreboding
for
still
the
spark
burned
hitherto
it
had
been
but
a
glad
light
on
all
things
except
men
and
women
for
into
their
souls
the
spark
looked
too
far
and
open
brow
was
shadowed
deeply
and
often
with
sorrows
not
her
own
and
her
heart
ached
many
a
day
for
pains
she
could
not
or
dared
not
relieve
but
if
she
were
left
alone
the
illumination
of
the
spark
filled
everything
about
her
with
glory
the
sky
rapturous
blue
the
vivid
tints
of
grass
and
leaves
the
dismaying
splendor
of
roses
the
milky
the
brilliant
whiteness
of
the
lily
the
turquoise
eyes
of
all
these
gave
her
a
pleasure
intense
as
pain
and
the
songs
of
the
winds
the
of
june
midnights
the
gathering
roar
of
autumn
tempests
the
rattle
of
thunder
the
breathless
and
lurid
pause
before
a
tropic
storm
all
these
the
spark
enhanced
and
vivified
till
seeing
how
blest
in
herself
and
the
company
of
nature
the
child
of
the
kingdom
grew
queen
lura
deliberated
silently
and
long
whether
she
should
return
the
gift
of
the
fairy
cordis
and
let
maya
live
so
tranquil
and
ignorant
forever
or
whether
she
should
awaken
her
from
her
dreams
and
set
her
on
her
way
through
the
world
but
now
the
princess
maya
began
to
grow
pale
and
listless
her
eyes
shone
brighter
than
ever
but
she
was
consumed
with
a
feverish
longing
to
see
new
and
strange
things
on
her
knees
and
weeping
she
implored
her
mother
to
release
her
from
the
court
routine
and
let
her
wander
in
the
woods
and
watch
the
village
children
play
so
queen
lura
having
now
another
little
daughter
named
maddala
who
was
just
like
all
other
children
and
a
great
comfort
to
her
mother
was
the
more
inclined
to
grant
maya
prayer
she
therefore
told
maya
all
that
was
before
her
and
having
put
upon
her
tiny
finger
the
bade
the
take
off
her
velvet
robe
and
the
gold
circlet
in
her
hair
and
clothe
her
in
a
russet
suit
of
serge
with
a
gray
kirtle
and
hood
king
joconde
was
gone
to
the
wars
queen
lura
cried
a
little
the
princess
maddala
laughed
and
maya
went
out
alone
not
lonely
for
the
spark
burned
high
and
clear
and
showed
all
the
legends
written
on
the
world
everywhere
and
maya
read
them
as
she
went
out
on
the
wide
plain
she
passed
many
little
houses
but
through
all
their
low
casements
the
red
gleam
of
a
fire
shone
and
on
the
clustered
happy
children
or
a
peasant
bride
with
warm
blushes
on
her
cheek
sat
spinning
or
a
young
mother
with
pensive
eyes
lulled
her
baby
to
its
twilight
sleep
and
sheltered
it
with
still
prayers
one
of
these
kindly
cottages
harbored
maya
for
the
night
and
then
her
way
at
dawn
lay
through
a
vast
forest
where
the
dim
stretched
far
away
till
they
grew
undefined
as
a
gray
cloud
and
only
here
and
there
the
sunshine
strewed
its
on
ferns
and
mosses
feathery
and
soft
as
strange
plumage
and
costly
velvet
sometimes
a
little
brook
with
bubbling
laughter
crept
across
her
path
and
slid
over
the
black
rocks
gurgling
and
dimpling
in
the
shadow
or
sparkling
in
the
sun
while
fish
red
and
swam
noiseless
as
dreams
and
darting
poised
a
moment
on
the
surface
cast
a
glittering
diamond
reflection
on
the
yellow
sand
beneath
the
way
grew
long
and
maya
weary
the
new
leaves
of
opalescent
tint
shed
odors
of
faint
and
passionate
sweetness
the
birds
sang
that
smote
the
sense
like
a
caress
a
warm
wind
yearned
and
complained
in
the
pine
boughs
far
above
her
yet
her
heart
grew
heavy
and
her
eyes
dim
she
was
sick
for
home
not
for
the
palace
and
the
court
not
for
her
mother
and
maddala
but
for
home
she
knew
her
exile
and
wept
to
return
that
night
and
for
many
nights
she
slept
in
the
forest
and
when
at
length
she
came
out
upon
the
plain
beyond
she
was
pale
and
wan
her
dark
eyes
drooped
her
slender
figure
was
bowed
and
languid
and
only
the
mark
upon
her
brow
where
the
coronet
had
fretted
its
whiteness
betrayed
that
maya
was
a
princess
born
and
now
dwellings
began
to
dot
the
country
brown
cottages
with
clinging
vines
villas
aërial
and
with
pointed
roofs
and
capricious
windows
huts
in
which
some
poor
wretch
from
his
bed
of
straw
looked
out
upon
the
wasteful
luxury
of
his
neighbor
and
loathing
his
bitter
crust
and
turbid
water
saw
feasts
spread
in
the
open
air
where
tropic
fruits
and
beaded
wine
mocked
his
feverish
thirst
and
palaces
of
stainless
marble
rising
tower
upon
tower
and
turret
over
turret
like
the
pearly
heaps
of
cloud
before
a
storm
while
the
wind
swept
from
their
gilded
lattices
bursts
of
festal
music
the
chorus
that
receives
a
bride
or
the
triumphal
notes
of
a
warrior
return
all
these
maya
passed
by
for
no
door
was
open
and
no
fireless
hearth
revealed
but
before
night
dropped
her
starry
veil
she
had
travelled
to
a
mansion
whose
door
was
set
wide
and
within
a
cold
hearth
was
piled
with
boughs
of
oak
and
beech
the
opal
upon
finger
grew
dim
but
she
moved
toward
the
unlit
wood
and
at
her
approach
the
false
pretence
betrayed
itself
the
ice
glared
before
her
and
chilled
her
to
the
soul
as
its
shroud
of
bark
fell
off
she
fled
over
the
threshold
and
the
laughed
with
bitter
mirth
but
the
spark
was
safe
now
came
thronging
streets
and
many
an
open
portal
wooed
maya
but
wooed
in
vain
once
upon
the
steps
of
a
quaint
and
picturesque
cottage
stood
an
artist
with
eyes
that
flashed
heaven
own
azure
and
lit
his
waving
curls
with
a
gleam
of
gold
his
pleading
look
tempted
the
child
of
the
kingdom
with
potent
affinities
of
land
and
likeness
his
fair
cottage
called
her
from
wall
and
casement
with
the
spiritual
eyes
of
ideal
faces
looking
down
upon
her
forever
changeless
and
forever
pure
but
when
from
purest
pity
kindness
and
she
would
have
drawn
near
the
hearth
a
sigh
like
the
passing
of
a
soul
shivered
by
her
and
before
its
breath
the
shapely
embers
fell
to
dust
the
hearth
beneath
was
heaped
with
ashes
and
with
tearful
lids
maya
turned
away
and
the
weeping
closed
the
door
behind
her
long
days
and
nights
passed
ere
she
essayed
again
and
then
weary
and
faint
with
she
lingered
on
the
steps
of
a
lofty
house
whose
carved
door
was
swung
open
whose
jasper
hearthstone
was
heaped
with
goodly
logs
and
beside
it
on
the
soft
skin
of
a
panther
slept
a
youth
beautiful
as
adonis
and
in
his
sleep
ever
murmuring
mother
maya
heart
yearned
with
a
kindred
pang
she
too
was
orphaned
in
her
soul
and
she
would
gladly
have
lit
the
fire
upon
this
lonely
hearth
and
companioned
the
solitude
of
the
sleeper
but
alas
the
boughs
still
wore
their
summer
garland
and
from
each
severed
end
slow
tears
of
distilled
honeyedly
upon
the
stone
beneath
of
such
withes
and
saplings
comes
no
living
fire
maya
smiling
set
a
kiss
upon
the
brow
but
the
spark
lay
quiet
and
the
flung
a
blooming
after
its
departing
guest
the
year
was
now
wellnigh
run
the
princess
maya
despaired
of
home
the
earth
seemed
a
harsh
stepmother
and
its
children
rather
stones
than
clay
a
vague
sense
of
some
fearful
barrier
between
herself
and
her
kind
haunted
the
woman
soul
within
her
and
the
unquenchable
flames
of
the
spark
seemed
to
girdle
her
with
a
defence
that
drove
away
even
friendly
ingress
night
and
day
she
wept
oppressed
with
loneliness
she
knew
not
how
to
speak
the
tongues
of
men
though
well
she
understood
their
significance
only
little
children
mated
rightly
with
her
divine
infancy
only
the
mute
glories
of
nature
satisfied
for
a
moment
her
brooding
soul
the
celestial
impulses
within
her
beat
their
wings
in
futile
longing
for
freedom
and
with
inexpressible
anguish
she
uttered
her
griefs
aloud
or
sung
them
to
such
plaintive
strains
that
all
who
heard
wept
in
sympathy
yet
she
had
no
home
after
many
days
she
came
upon
a
broad
champaign
fertile
land
where
on
a
gentle
knoll
among
budding
orchards
and
fields
green
with
winter
grains
stood
a
low
house
with
gay
parterres
and
clipped
hedges
around
it
all
ordered
with
artistic
harmony
while
over
chimney
and
cornice
crept
wreaths
of
glossy
ivy
every
deep
green
leaf
veined
with
streaks
of
light
and
its
graceful
sprays
clasping
and
clinging
wherever
they
touched
the
chiselled
stone
beneath
upon
the
lawn
opened
a
broad
low
door
and
the
southern
sun
streamed
inward
showing
the
carved
panels
of
the
fireplace
and
its
red
hearth
where
heavy
boughs
of
wood
and
splinters
from
the
heart
of
the
pine
lay
ready
for
the
hand
of
the
coming
to
kindle
upon
the
threshold
plucking
out
the
dead
leaves
of
the
ivy
stood
one
from
whose
face
strength
and
beauty
and
guile
that
the
guileless
knew
not
shone
sunlike
upon
maya
and
as
she
faltered
and
paused
he
spoke
a
welcome
to
her
in
her
own
language
and
held
toward
her
the
clasping
hand
of
help
a
thrill
of
mad
joy
cleft
the
heart
of
the
princess
a
glow
of
incarnate
summer
dyed
with
rose
her
cheek
and
lip
the
spark
blazed
through
her
brimming
eyes
weariness
vanished
home
home
sung
her
rapt
lips
and
in
the
delirious
ecstasy
of
the
hour
she
pressed
toward
the
hearth
laid
down
her
scrip
and
staff
upon
the
heaped
wood
flung
herself
on
the
red
stone
and
heedless
of
the
opal
talisman
flashed
outward
from
her
joyful
eyes
the
spark
the
crown
the
curse
so
a
forked
tongue
of
lightning
speeds
from
its
cloud
and
cleaves
the
oak
to
its
centre
so
the
blaze
of
a
meteor
rushes
through
and
is
gone
the
spark
lit
quivered
sunk
and
flashed
again
but
the
wood
lay
unlighted
beneath
it
maya
gasped
for
breath
and
with
the
long
respiration
the
spark
returned
lit
upon
her
lips
seared
them
like
a
hot
iron
and
entered
into
her
heart
the
blighting
canker
of
her
fate
a
bitterness
in
flesh
and
spirit
forevermore
writhing
with
anguish
and
contempt
she
turned
away
from
the
wrought
stone
whose
semblance
had
beguiled
her
to
her
mortal
loss
and
as
she
passed
from
the
step
another
hand
lit
a
consuming
blaze
beneath
her
staff
and
scrip
sending
a
sword
of
flame
after
her
to
the
threshold
and
the
shrieked
aloud
only
stones
together
strike
fire
maya
while
from
the
casement
above
looked
forth
two
faces
false
and
fair
with
eyes
of
azure
ice
and
disdainful
smiles
and
bound
together
by
a
curling
serpent
that
ringed
itself
in
portentous
symbol
about
their
waists
with
eyes
proud
lips
and
erect
head
maya
went
out
her
laugh
rang
loud
her
song
soared
in
wild
and
mocking
cadence
to
the
stars
her
rigid
brow
wore
scorn
like
a
coronal
of
flame
and
with
a
scathed
nature
she
trod
the
streets
of
the
city
mixed
with
its
wondering
crowds
made
the
spark
a
blaze
and
a
marvel
in
all
lands
but
hid
the
opal
in
her
bosom
for
its
scarlet
spot
of
had
dropped
away
and
the
jewel
was
broken
across
so
the
wide
world
heard
of
maya
the
child
of
the
kingdom
and
from
land
to
land
men
carried
the
stinging
arrows
of
her
wit
or
signalled
the
of
her
scorn
while
seas
and
shores
unknown
echoed
her
mad
and
rapt
music
or
answered
the
veiled
agony
that
derided
itself
with
choruses
of
laughter
from
every
mystic
whisper
of
the
wave
or
roar
of
falling
headlands
and
then
she
fled
away
lest
in
the
turbulent
whirl
of
life
the
curse
should
craze
and
not
slay
her
for
sleep
had
vanished
with
wordless
moans
and
frighted
aspect
from
her
pillow
or
if
it
dared
standing
afar
off
to
cast
its
pallid
shadow
there
still
there
was
neither
rest
nor
refreshing
in
the
troubled
spell
nor
could
the
thirst
that
consumed
her
quench
itself
with
red
wine
or
crystal
water
translucent
grapes
or
the
crimson
fruits
that
summer
kisses
into
sweetness
with
her
heats
forever
longing
and
forever
unsated
it
parched
her
lips
and
burnt
her
gasping
mouth
but
there
was
no
draught
to
allay
it
and
even
so
food
failed
of
its
office
kindly
hands
brought
to
her
whose
queenliness
asserted
itself
to
their
souls
with
an
innocent
loftiness
careless
of
pomp
or
insignia
all
delicate
dates
and
exquisite
viands
but
neither
the
keen
and
stimulating
odors
of
savory
meat
the
crisp
whiteness
of
freshest
bread
nor
the
gold
of
honeycomb
could
tempt
her
to
eat
the
simplest
peasant
fare
in
measure
too
scanty
for
a
linnet
sustained
her
life
but
the
curse
lit
even
upon
her
food
and
those
lips
of
fire
burned
all
things
in
their
touch
to
tasteless
ashes
so
she
fled
away
for
the
forest
was
cool
and
lonely
and
even
as
she
learned
the
lies
and
treacheries
of
men
so
she
longed
to
leave
them
behind
her
and
die
in
bitterness
less
bitter
for
its
solitude
but
maya
fled
not
from
herself
the
winds
wailed
like
the
crying
of
despair
in
her
pines
the
shining
rustled
hisses
upon
her
unstrung
ear
the
timid
who
own
no
rule
but
patient
love
and
caresses
hid
from
her
defiant
step
and
dazzling
eye
and
when
she
knew
herself
in
no
wise
healed
by
the
ministries
of
nature
in
the
very
apathy
of
desperation
she
flung
herself
by
the
clear
fountain
that
had
already
fallen
upon
her
lips
and
cooled
them
with
bitter
water
and
hiding
her
head
under
the
broad
fresh
leaves
of
a
calla
that
bent
its
marble
cups
above
her
knitted
brow
and
loosened
hair
she
lay
in
deathlike
trance
till
the
fairy

swept
her
feet
with
fringed
garments
and
cast
the
serpent

and
glittering
upon
her
breast

the

deep
tones
and
for

the

held
toward
her
with

the

retorted

the

no

there

thou

fire
or
wilt
thou
turn
the
sleep

rest
thee

draught

similar

upon

ourselves
by
contemplating
the
difficulties
of
the
problem
and
the
improbability
that
in
our
generation
at
least
we
shall
be
deprived
of
these
subjects
of
general
news
and
universal
interest
during
the
last
the
progress
of
experimental
philosophy
in
the
direction
of
the
weather
though
its
results
are
for
the
most
part
of
a
negative
character
has
yet
been
sufficient
to
excite
the
apprehensions
of
the
philanthropist
we
have
unlearned
many
fables
and
false
theories
and
have
made
great
advancement
in
that
knowledge
of
our
ignorance
which
is
the
only
true
foundation
of
positive
science
the
moon
has
been
deposed
from
the
executive
chair
though
she
still
has
her
supporters
and
advocates
and
an
innumerable
host
of
minor
causes
are
found
to
constitute
upon
strictly
republican
principles
the
ruling
power
of
the
winds
and
the
rain
that
regularity
however
complicated
which
reason
still
demands
and
expects
even
from
the
weather
is
not
found
to
be
so
simple
as
our
rules
and
signs
of
the
weather
indicate
for
the
operation
of
these
innumerable
causes
is
so
complicated
that
the
repetition
of
similar
phenomena
or
similar
combinations
of
causes
to
any
great
extent
is
the
most
improbable
of
events
perhaps
the
meteorologist
will
ultimately
find
that
nature
has
succeeded
in
what
seems
indeed
to
be
her
aim
in
completely
retracing
her
steps
and
reducing
the
operation
of
that
simple
and
regular
system
of
causes
which
she
brought
out
of
chaos
back
to
a
confusion
of
detail
from
which
all
law
and
regularity
are
obliterated
meteorological
observations
have
however
determined
many
regular
and
constant
causes
and
a
few
regular
phenomena
the
method
pursued
in
these
investigations
is
for
the
most
part
the
elimination
by
general
averages
of
limited
and
temporary
changes
in
the
elements
of
the
weather
and
the
determination
of
those
changes
which
depend
upon
the
constant
influences
of
locality
of
season
and
of
constant
or
slowly
varying
causes
these
constant
influences
constitute
the
climate
and
the
study
of
climates
is
thus
the
first
step
towards
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
the
weather
climates
in
their
changes
and
distribution
are
very
important
elements
in
the
determination
of
the
movements
of
the
weather
and
are
to
the
meteorologist
what
the
elements
of
the
planetary
orbits
are
to
the
astronomer
but
unlike
planetary
perturbations
the
weather
makes
the
most
reckless
excursions
from
its
averages
and
obscures
them
by
a
most
inconsequent
and
incalculable
fickleness
whether
mechanical
science
will
hereafter
succeed
in
calculating
these
perturbations
of
climate
as
we
may
style
the
weather
or
will
find
the
problem
beyond
its
capacity
it
will
yet
doubtless
account
for
much
that
is
now
obscure
as
observation
brings
the
facts
more
distinctly
to
view
we
propose
to
give
a
brief
general
survey
of
the
mechanics
of
the
atmosphere
in
its
present
state
and
to
indicate
the
nature
and
limits
of
our
knowledge
on
this
subject
among
the
first
noticed
and
most
remarkable
features
of
regularity
in
atmospheric
changes
are
constant
periodic
and
prevailing
winds
the
most
remarkable
instances
of
these
are
the
of
the
torrid
zone
the
monsoons
of
the
indian
ocean
and
the
prevailing
southwest
wind
of
our
northern
temperate
latitudes
of
these
the
are
the
most
important
to
science
as
furnishing
the
key
to
that
general
explanation
of
the
winds
which
was
first
advanced
by
the
distinguished
halley
in
halley
celebrated
theory
the
are
explained
as
the
effects
of
the
unequal
distribution
of
the
sun
heat
in
different
latitudes
the
air
of
the
equator
heated
more
than
the
northern
or
southern
air
expands
more
and
overflows
moving
in
the
upper
regions
of
the
atmosphere
toward
the
poles
while
the
lower
colder
air
on
both
sides
moves
toward
the
equator
to
preserve
equilibrium
thus
an
extensive
circulation
is
carried
on
the
air
that
moves
from
the
equator
in
the
upper
atmosphere
gradually
sinking
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
finally
ceases
to
move
toward
the
poles
and
returns
as
an
undercurrent
to
the
equator
where
it
again
rises
and
moves
toward
the
poles
now
the
air
of
the
equator
moving
with
the
earth
rotary
motion
has
a
greater
velocity
than
the
earth
itself
at
high
northern
or
southern
latitudes
and
consequently
appears
to
gain
an
eastward
motion
in
its
progress
toward
the
poles
without
friction
this
relative
eastward
motion
would
increase
as
the
air
moves
toward
the
poles
and
diminish
at
the
same
rate
as
the
air
returns
till
at
the
equator
the
velocity
of
the
earth
and
of
the
air
would
again
be
equal
but
friction
reduces
the
motion
of
the
returning
air
to
that
of
the
earth
at
or
near
the
calms
of
the
tropics
so
that
the
air
passing
the
tropics
gains
a
relative
westward
motion
in
its
further
progress
through
the
torrid
zone
the
southwestward
motion
thus
produced
between
the
tropic
of
cancer
and
the
equator
is
the
now
according
to
this
theory
the
prevailing
winds
of
our
temperate
latitudes
ought
to
have
a
southeastward
motion
as
far
as
the
calms
of
cancer
or
the
horse
latitudes
moreover
instead
of
these
calms
there
should
still
be
a
southward
motion
but
observation
has
shown
that
though
the
prevailing
lower
winds
of
our
latitude
move
eastward
still
their
motion
is
toward
the
north
rather
than
the
south
so
that
they
appear
to
contradict
the
theory
by
which
the
are
explained
to
account
for
these
anomalies
lieut
maury
has
invented
a
very
ingenious
hypothesis
which
is
published
in
his
physical
geography
of
the
sea
he
supposes
that
the
air
which
passes
from
the
equator
toward
the
poles
in
the
upper
regions
of
the
atmosphere
is
brought
down
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
beyond
the
calms
of
the
tropics
and
that
it
thence
proceeds
with
an
increasing
eastward
motion
appearing
in
our
northern
hemisphere
as
the
prevailing
northeastward
winds
approaching
the
poles
with
a
spiral
motion
the
air
there
rises
according
to
this
hypothesis
in
a
vortex
and
returns
toward
the
equator
in
the
upper
atmosphere
gradually
acquiring
a
westward
motion
till
returning
to
the
tropics
it
is
again
brought
down
to
the
earth
and
thence
proceeds
with
a
still
increasing
westward
motion
as
the
at
the
equator
the
air
rises
again
and
according
to
lieut
maury
crosses
to
the
other
side
and
proceeds
through
a
similar
course
in
the
other
hemisphere
the
rising
of
the
air
at
the
equator
is
supposed
to
cause
the
equatorial
rains
and
the
drought
of
the
tropics
is
also
explained
by
that
descent
of
the
air
in
these
latitudes
which
this
hypothesis
supposes
now
although
this
hypothesis
explains
the
phenomena
it
has
still
met
with
great
opposition
the
motions
which
lieut
maury
supposes
can
hardly
be
accounted
for
without
resorting
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
to
electricity
or
magnetism
to
some
occult
cause
or
some
occult
operation
of
a
known
cause
moreover
it
has
been
difficult
for
the
mechanical
philosopher
to
understand
how
the
winds
manage
to
cross
each
other
as
lieut
maury
supposes
them
to
do
at
the
equator
and
the
tropics
without
getting
into
entangling
alliances
if
this
hypothesis
were
advanced
not
as
a
physical
explanation
of
the
phenomena
but
like
the
epicycles
and
eccentrics
of
ptolemy
to
save
the
appearances
its
ingenuity
would
be
greatly
to
its
author
credit
but
like
the
epicycles
and
eccentrics
though
it
represents
the
phenomena
well
enough
it
contradicts
laws
of
motion
now
well
known
which
ought
to
be
familiar
to
every
physical
philosopher
but
these
speculations
of
lieut
maury
will
now
be
superseded
by
a
new
theory
of
atmospheric
movements
an
account
of
which
was
presented
by
its
author
thompson
at
the
recent
meeting
of
the
british
association
for
the
advancement
of
science
footnote
a
fuller
discussion
of
this
theory
the
author
reserved
for
the
royal
society
the
gives
a
brief
abstract
of
his
paper
in
its
report
of
the
proceedings
of
the
association
thompson
theory
takes
account
of
forces
hitherto
unnoticed
which
are
generated
by
the
eastward
circulation
of
the
atmosphere
in
high
latitudes
he
shows
that
these
forces
cause
the
prevailing
northeastward
of
our
latitudes
while
above
this
yet
below
the
highest
northeastward
current
the
air
ought
still
to
move
southward
according
to
halley
theory
this
is
not
the
immediate
effect
of
differences
of
temperature
but
a
secondary
effect
induced
by
the
friction
of
the
earth
surface
and
the
continual
deflection
of
the
air
eastward
motion
from
a
great
circle
in
which
the
air
tends
to
move
into
the
small
circle
of
the
latitude
in
which
the
air
actually
does
move
the
force
of
this
deflection
measured
by
the
centrifugal
force
of
the
air
as
it
circulates
around
the
pole
retards
the
movement
from
the
equator
and
finally
wholly
suspends
it
so
that
the
upper
air
circulates
around
in
the
higher
latitudes
as
water
may
be
made
to
circulate
in
a
pail
and
the
air
is
drawn
away
from
the
polar
regions
as
this
circulatory
motion
is
communicated
to
it
and
tends
to
accumulate
in
the
middle
latitudes
as
the
circulating
water
is
heaped
up
around
the
sides
of
the
pail
hence
in
the
middle
latitudes
there
is
a
greater
weight
of
air
than
at
the
poles
and
this
tends
to
press
the
lower
air
to
higher
latitudes
centrifugal
force
however
balances
this
pressure
so
long
as
the
lower
air
moves
with
the
velocity
of
the
upper
strata
but
as
the
friction
of
the
earth
retards
its
motion
and
diminishes
its
centrifugal
force
it
gradually
yields
to
the
pressure
of
the
air
above
it
and
moves
toward
the
poles
near
the
polar
circles
it
is
again
retarded
by
its
increasing
centrifugal
force
and
it
returns
through
the
middle
regions
of
the
atmosphere
thus
there
are
two
systems
of
atmospheric
circulation
in
each
hemisphere
the
principal
one
extends
from
the
equator
to
high
middle
latitudes
and
partly
overlies
the
other
which
extends
from
the
tropical
calms
to
the
polar
circles
these
two
circulations
move
in
opposite
directions
like
two
wheels
when
one
communicates
its
motion
to
the
other
by
the
contact
of
their
circumferences
in
the
middle
latitudes
the
lower
current
of
the
principal
circulation
lies
upon
the
upper
current
of
the
secondary
circulation
and
both
move
together
toward
the
equator
this
principal
lower
current
first
touches
the
earth
surface
beyond
the
tropical
calms
and
having
lost
its
relative
eastward
motion
and
now
tending
westward
it
appears
as
the
very
regular
and
constant
while
the
upper
secondary
current
returns
without
reaching
the
tropics
as
an
undercurrent
and
in
our
latitude
appears
as
the
prevailing
northeastward
wind
a
very
feeble
motion
usually
lost
in
the
weather
winds
and
other
disturbances
and
only
appearing
distinctly
in
the
general
average
thompson
illustrates
the
effect
of
the
friction
of
the
surface
on
the
eastward
circulation
of
the
air
by
a
very
simple
experiment
with
a
pail
of
water
if
we
put
into
the
pail
grains
of
any
material
a
little
heavier
than
water
and
then
give
the
water
a
rotatory
motion
by
stirring
it
the
grains
ought
by
the
centrifugal
force
imparted
to
them
to
collect
around
the
sides
of
the
pail
but
sinking
to
the
bottom
they
do
in
fact
tend
to
collect
at
the
centre
carried
inward
by
those
currents
which
the
friction
of
the
sides
and
bottom
indirectly
produces
thus
thompson
beautiful
and
philosophical
theory
completes
that
of
halley
and
explains
all
those
apparent
anomalies
which
have
hitherto
seemed
irreconcilable
with
the
only
rational
account
of
the
the
rainless
calms
of
the
tropics
are
explained
by
this
theory
without
that
crossing
and
interference
of
winds
which
lieut
maury
supposes
for
the
secondary
circulation
returns
as
an
toward
the
poles
without
reaching
the
tropics
and
the
dry
lower
current
of
the
principal
circulation
passes
over
the
tropical
latitudes
in
its
gradual
descent
before
it
reaches
the
earth
as
the
these
absorbing
moisture
from
the
sea
precipitate
it
as
they
rise
again
and
produce
the
constant
equatorial
rains
and
these
rains
doubtless
tend
much
more
powerfully
than
the
mere
unequal
distribution
of
heat
to
direct
the
wind
toward
the
equator
for
the
fall
of
rain
rapidly
diminishes
the
pressure
of
the
air
and
disturbs
its
equilibrium
so
that
violent
winds
are
frequently
observed
to
blow
toward
rainy
districts
thus
primarily
the
unequal
distribution
of
heat
and
more
immediately
the
equatorial
rains
cause
the
principal
circulation
of
our
atmosphere
and
this
indirectly
produces
the
secondary
circulation
of
theory
both
these
regular
movements
are
however
greatly
disturbed
and
especially
the
latter
by
winds
which
are
occasioned
by
local
and
irregular
rains
in
these
movements
and
their
causes
we
have
the
general
outline
of
our
subject
within
which
we
must
now
sketch
the
weather
the
causes
of
atmospheric
movement
which
we
have
thus
far
considered
are
the
unequal
distribution
of
the
sun
heat
the
absorption
and
precipitation
of
moisture
the
direct
and
the
inductive
action
of
the
earth
rotation
and
friction
if
to
these
we
should
add
the
tidal
action
of
the
sun
and
moon
attractions
we
should
perhaps
complete
the
list
of
which
are
certainly
known
to
exert
a
more
or
less
general
influence
upon
the
atmosphere
but
this
short
list
is
long
enough
as
we
shall
soon
see
if
the
earth
were
wholly
covered
with
water
of
a
uniform
depth
its
climates
would
be
distributed
with
greater
regularity
and
the
perturbations
of
climate
would
be
comparatively
small
and
regular
though
even
under
such
circumstances
there
would
still
exist
a
tendency
to
discontinuity
and
complexity
of
movements
from
that
influence
of
rain
the
peculiar
character
of
which
we
shall
soon
consider
the
irregular
distribution
of
land
and
water
and
the
peculiar
action
of
each
in
imparting
the
heat
of
the
sun
to
the
incumbent
air
the
irregular
distribution
of
plains
and
mountains
and
their
various
effects
in
different
positions
and
at
different
altitudes
the
distribution
of
heat
effected
by
ocean
currents
all
these
tend
to
produce
permanent
derangements
of
climate
and
great
irregularities
in
the
weather
to
these
we
must
add
what
the
astronomer
calls
disturbing
actions
of
the
second
order
effects
of
the
disturbances
themselves
upon
the
action
of
the
disturbing
agencies
effects
of
the
irregular
winds
upon
the
distribution
of
heat
and
rain
and
upon
the
action
of
lands
and
seas
mountains
and
plains
though
such
disturbances
are
comparatively
insignificant
in
the
motions
of
the
planets
yet
in
the
weather
they
are
often
more
important
than
the
primary
causes
the
aggregate
and
permanent
effect
of
all
these
disturbing
causes
primary
and
secondary
is
seen
in
that
irregular
distribution
of
climates
which
the
tortuous
isothermal
lines
and
the
mottled
raincharts
illustrate
the
isothermal
lines
may
be
regarded
as
the
topographical
delineations
of
that
bed
of
temperatures
down
which
the
upper
atmosphere
flows
from
the
equator
toward
the
poles
till
its
downward
tendency
is
balanced
by
the
centrifugal
force
of
its
eastward
motion
this
irregular
bed
shifts
from
month
to
month
from
day
to
day
and
even
from
hour
to
hour
and
the
lines
that
are
drawn
on
the
maps
are
only
averages
for
the
year
or
the
season
in
the
midst
of
these
irregular
but
continuous
agencies
the
rain
introduces
a
peculiar
discontinuity
and
turns
irregularity
into
discord
we
have
shown
that
the
rain
is
an
immediate
cause
of
wind
but
how
is
the
rain
itself
produced
for
so
marked
an
effect
we
naturally
seek
a
special
cause
but
no
adequate
single
cause
has
ever
been
discovered
the
combination
of
many
conditions
probably
is
necessary
such
as
a
peculiar
distribution
of
heat
and
moisture
and
atmospheric
movements
though
the
immediate
cause
of
the
fall
of
rain
is
doubtless
the
rising
and
consequent
expansion
and
cooling
of
the
saturated
air
the
winds
that
blow
hither
and
thither
vainly
striving
to
restore
equilibrium
to
the
atmosphere
burden
themselves
with
the
moisture
they
absorb
from
the
seas
and
this
moisture
absorbs
their
heat
retards
their
motion
and
slowly
modifies
the
forces
which
impel
them
now
when
the
saturated
air
extending
far
above
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
carried
in
its
movements
still
higher
is
relieved
of
an
incumbent
weight
of
air
it
becomes
rarefied
and
its
temperature
and
capacity
for
moisture
are
simultaneously
diminished
its
moisture
suddenly
precipitated
appears
as
a
cloud
the
particles
of
which
collect
into
and
fall
to
the
earth
thus
the
air
suddenly
loses
much
of
its
weight
and
instead
of
restoring
equilibrium
to
the
troubled
atmosphere
it
introduces
a
new
source
of
disturbance
though
the
weight
of
the
air
is
diminished
by
the
fall
of
rain
yet
the
bulk
is
increased
by
the
expansive
force
of
the
latent
heat
which
the
condensed
vapors
set
free
thus
the
rainy
air
expands
upwards
and
flows
outwards
and
no
longer
able
to
balance
the
pressure
of
the
surrounding
air
it
is
carried
still
higher
by
inblowing
winds
which
rise
in
turn
and
continue
the
process
often
extending
the
storm
over
vast
areas
the
force
of
these
movements
is
measured
partly
by
the
force
of
latent
heat
set
free
and
partly
by
the
mechanical
power
of
the
a
very
small
fraction
of
which
constitutes
the
of
all
our
rivers
such
a
fruitful
source
of
disturbance
generated
by
so
slight
an
accident
as
the
upward
movement
of
the
saturated
air
expanded
by
its
own
agency
to
so
great
an
extent
so
sudden
and
discontinuous
in
its
action
so
obscure
in
its
origin
and
so
distinct
in
its
effects
such
a
phenomenon
defies
the
powers
of
mathematical
prediction
and
rouses
all
the
winds
to
sedition
a
storm
not
only
disturbs
the
lower
winds
but
its
influences
reach
even
to
the
upper
movements
the
sudden
expansion
and
rising
of
the
rainy
air
delay
these
movements
which
afterwards
react
as
violent
winds
the
forces
stored
away
by
the
gradual
rise
of
vapor
and
its
absorption
of
heat
and
then
suddenly
exhibited
in
a
mechanical
form
by
the
effects
of
rain
afford
an
illustration
of
that
principle
of
conservation
and
economy
of
power
of
which
there
are
so
many
examples
in
modern
science
no
power
is
ever
destroyed
whether
exhibited
as
heat
or
mechanical
force
in
the
products
and
forces
of
chemical
or
of
vital
action
in
movement
or
in
altered
conditions
of
motion
whether
changed
by
the
growth
of
plants
into
fuel
or
into
food
and
converted
again
to
heat
by
combustion
or
by
vital
processes
and
brought
out
as
mechanical
power
in
the
or
in
the
horse
it
is
still
the
same
power
and
is
measured
in
each
of
its
forms
by
an
invariable
standard
it
first
appears
as
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
a
portion
escapes
at
once
back
into
space
while
the
rest
passes
first
through
a
series
of
transformations
a
part
is
changed
into
moving
winds
or
into
suspended
vapor
and
a
part
into
fuel
or
food
from
conditions
of
motion
it
is
changed
into
motion
from
motion
it
is
changed
by
friction
or
resistance
into
heat
electric
force
molecular
vibrations
or
into
new
conditions
of
motion
and
passing
through
its
course
of
changes
it
remains
embroiled
in
its
permanent
effects
or
escapes
into
space
as
heat
though
mechanical
science
will
probably
never
be
able
to
predict
the
beginning
or
duration
of
storms
it
will
yet
doubtless
be
able
to
account
for
all
their
general
features
and
for
such
distinct
local
peculiarities
as
observation
may
determine
great
advancement
has
already
been
made
in
the
determination
of
prevailing
winds
and
in
the
study
of
storms
two
theories
have
been
brought
forward
upon
the
general
movements
of
storms
both
have
been
proved
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
their
advocates
by
the
storms
themselves
and
probably
both
are
with
some
limitations
true
the
first
of
these
theories
we
have
already
described
according
to
it
the
winds
move
inward
toward
the
centre
of
the
storm
according
to
the
other
theory
they
blow
in
a
circumference
around
the
centre
observations
upon
storms
of
small
extent
such
as
or
tornadoes
show
very
clearly
that
the
winds
blow
toward
the
stormy
district
but
when
observations
are
made
upon
the
winds
within
the
district
of
such
extensive
storms
as
sometimes
visit
the
united
states
the
directions
of
the
wind
are
found
to
be
so
various
that
the
advocates
of
either
theory
making
due
allowance
for
local
disturbances
can
triumphantly
refute
their
adversaries
in
such
storms
there
are
doubtless
many
centres
or
maxima
of
rain
and
whether
the
wind
move
around
or
toward
these
centres
it
would
inevitably
get
confused
the
opinion
that
the
winds
move
around
the
central
point
or
line
of
the
storm
was
strenuously
maintained
by
the
late
redfield
whose
activity
in
his
favorite
pursuit
has
connected
his
name
inseparably
with
meteorology
others
have
maintained
the
same
opinion
and
the
rotatory
motion
of
the
tropical
hurricanes
is
offered
as
a
principal
proof
it
is
obvious
from
the
causes
of
motion
already
considered
that
if
the
air
is
carried
far
by
its
tendency
toward
a
rainy
district
it
will
acquire
a
secondary
relative
motion
from
its
change
of
latitude
and
this
in
our
hemisphere
if
the
air
move
toward
the
south
will
be
westward
if
toward
the
north
eastward
hence
the
motion
of
the
air
from
both
directions
toward
a
stormy
district
is
deflected
to
the
right
side
of
the
storm
and
this
gives
rise
to
that
motion
from
right
to
left
which
is
observed
in
the
hurricanes
of
the
northern
hemisphere
to
suppose
as
many
do
that
regular
winds
arising
from
constant
and
extensive
causes
can
come
into
bodily
conflict
and
preserve
their
identity
and
original
impetus
for
days
without
immediate
and
strongly
impelling
forces
to
sustain
their
motion
implies
a
profound
ignorance
of
mechanical
science
and
is
little
better
than
those
ancient
superstitions
which
gave
a
personal
identity
to
the
winds
the
momentum
of
ordinary
winds
is
a
feeble
force
in
comparison
with
those
forces
of
pressure
and
friction
which
continually
modify
it
hence
sudden
changes
in
the
direction
and
intensity
of
winds
must
primarily
arise
from
similar
changes
in
these
forces
but
there
are
no
known
forces
which
change
so
suddenly
except
the
pressure
and
latent
heat
of
suspended
vapor
and
therefore
the
fall
of
rain
is
the
only
adequate
known
cause
of
those
which
interpolated
among
the
gentler
winds
keep
the
atmosphere
in
perpetual
commotion
storms
have
however
certain
habits
and
peculiarities
more
or
less
regular
and
distinct
which
depend
upon
locality
and
season
and
this
is
what
ought
to
be
expected
for
though
the
storms
themselves
are
essentially
anomalous
yet
many
of
the
causes
which
cooperate
to
induce
them
are
constant
or
periodic
while
others
are
subject
to
but
slight
perturbations
it
is
obvious
that
no
more
moisture
can
be
precipitated
than
has
been
evaporated
and
that
the
winds
only
gain
suddenly
by
the
fall
of
rain
the
forces
which
they
have
lost
at
their
leisure
in
the
absorption
of
moisture
thus
the
rage
of
the
storm
is
kept
within
bounds
and
though
the
exact
period
at
which
the
winds
are
set
free
can
not
be
determined
yet
their
force
and
frequency
must
be
subject
to
certain
limitations
the
study
of
the
habits
and
peculiarities
of
storms
is
of
the
greatest
importance
to
navigation
and
agriculture
and
these
arts
have
already
been
benefited
by
the
labors
of
the
meteorologist
the
lawlessness
of
the
weather
within
certain
limitations
though
discouraging
to
the
physical
philosopher
has
yet
its
bright
side
for
the
student
of
final
causes
the
uses
of
the
weather
and
its
adaptation
to
organic
life
are
subjects
of
untiring
interest
the
progression
of
the
seasons
varied
by
differences
of
latitude
is
also
diversified
and
adapted
to
a
fuller
development
of
organic
variety
by
irregularities
of
climate
the
regular
alternations
of
day
and
night
summer
and
winter
dry
seasons
and
wet
are
adapted
to
those
alternations
of
organic
functions
which
belong
to
the
economy
of
life
the
vital
forces
of
plants
and
of
the
lower
orders
of
animals
have
not
that
capacity
of
change
which
is
necessary
to
the
complete
development
of
life
but
they
persist
in
their
present
mode
of
action
and
when
they
are
not
modified
by
outward
changes
reduce
life
to
its
simplest
phases
changes
of
growth
are
effected
by
those
apparent
hardships
to
which
life
is
subject
and
progression
in
new
directions
is
effected
by
retrogression
in
previous
modes
of
growth
the
old
leaves
and
branches
must
fall
the
wood
must
be
or
dried
the
substance
of
seeds
must
wither
and
then
decay
the
action
of
leaves
must
every
night
be
reversed
vines
and
branches
must
be
shaken
by
the
winds
that
the
energies
and
the
materials
of
new
forms
of
life
may
be
rendered
active
and
available
some
of
the
outward
changes
of
nature
are
regular
and
periodic
while
others
without
law
or
method
are
apparently
adapted
by
their
diversity
to
draw
out
the
unlimited
capacities
and
varieties
of
life
so
that
as
inorganic
nature
approaches
a
regulated
confusion
the
more
it
tends
to
bring
forth
that
perfect
order
of
which
fragments
appear
in
the
incomplete
system
of
actual
organic
life
the
classification
of
organic
forms
presents
to
the
naturalist
not
the
structure
of
a
regular
though
incomplete
development
but
the
broken
and
fragmentary
form
of
a
ruin
we
may
suppose
then
with
a
recent
physiological
writer
that
the
creation
of
those
organic
forms
which
constitute
this
fragmentary
system
was
effected
in
the
midst
of
an
elemental
storm
a
regulated
confusion
uniting
all
the
external
conditions
which
the
highest
capacities
and
the
greatest
varieties
of
organized
life
require
for
their
fullest
development
and
that
as
the
storm
subsided
into
a
simpler
but
less
genial
diversity
into
the
weather
whole
orders
and
genera
and
species
sank
with
it
from
the
ranks
of
possible
organic
forms
the
weather
fallen
from
its
high
estate
no
longer
able
to
develope
much
less
to
create
new
forms
can
only
sustain
those
that
are
left
to
its
care
man
finds
himself
everywhere
mirrored
in
nature
wayward
inconstant
always
seeking
rest
always
impelled
by
new
evils
the
greatest
of
which
he
himself
creates
protecting
and
cherishing
or
blighting
and
destroying
the
fragmentary
life
of
a
fallen
nature
incapable
himself
of
creating
new
capacities
but
nourishing
in
prosperity
and
quickening
in
adversity
those
that
are
left
he
sees
the
workings
of
his
own
life
in
the
strife
of
the
elements
his
powers
and
activities
are
related
to
his
spiritual
capacities
as
inorganic
movements
are
related
to
an
organizing
life
the
resurrection
of
his
higher
nature
is
like
a
new
creation
secret
sudden
inconsequent
the
wind
bloweth
where
it
listeth
and
thou
hearest
the
sound
thereof
but
canst
not

whence
it

and

chapter
iv
the
designs
of
elam
hunt
upon
the
hand
of
laura
stebbins
have
already
been
mentioned
in
a
former
chapter
of
this
history
as
well
as
the
fact
that
his
hopes
were
encouraged
by
jaynes
who
to
make
no
secret
of
the
matter
had
pledged
her
word
to
the
enamored
elam
that
when
he
should
be
settled
in
a
parish
of
his
own
laura
should
be
added
to
complete
the
sum
of
his
felicity
to
this
agreement
laura
herself
was
not
a
party
nay
her
consent
had
never
been
so
much
as
asked
for
though
elam
knew
that
marriage
by
proxy
was
impossible
and
indeed
would
doubtless
have
preferred
to
be
the
bridegroom
at
his
own
wedding
he
had
no
objection
whatever
to
a
vicarious
courtship
for
he
was
not
a
forward
suitor
delighting
to
prattle
of
his
pains
to
his
fair
tormentor
as
the
way
of
many
is
but
touching
all
the
terms
and
conditions
of
this
contract
laura
was
informed
by
jaynes
who
when
the
other
protested
with
tears
and
sobs
against
this
disposition
of
her
person
without
even
asking
her
leave
thereto
replied
with
a
quiet
voice
and
manner
that
she
had
the
right
to
make
the
promise
in
name
and
had
done
so
upon
due
consideration
this
ominous
reserve
frightened
laura
far
more
than
an
angry
reply
would
have
done
for
when
her
sister
spoke
with
such
brief
decision
it
was
a
sign
that
her
mind
was
made
up
and
laura
knew
full
well
the
resolute
purpose
with
which
jaynes
was
wont
to
pursue
any
design
that
she
had
once
formed
she
distrusted
her
own
ability
to
withstand
her
sister
inflexible
will
and
felt
a
secret
misgiving
that
in
spite
of
herself
she
would
by
some
means
be
forced
or
persuaded
to
yield
at
last
this
very
lack
of
faith
in
her
own
power
of
resistance
caused
her
more
distress
and
terror
than
all
her
other
fears
sometimes
she
almost
fancied
a
spell
of
enchantment
had
been
put
upon
her
which
would
render
all
her
efforts
to
escape
her
fate
as
unavailing
as
the
struggles
of
a
gnat
in
a
spider
web
a
friend
in
time
of
trouble
is
like
a
staff
to
one
that
is
lame
or
weary
but
when
laura
in
these
straits
leaned
upon
her
dearest
friend
cornelia
for
aid
and
comfort
she
found
but
a
broken
reed
for
instead
of
words
of
consolation
and
encouragement
cornelia
uttered
only
dismal
prophecies
that
laura
was
surely
doomed
to
be
the
young
parson
bride
if
you
only
had
another
lover
to
run
away
with
now
said
she
why
then
it
would
be
delightful
to
have
your
sister
act
as
she
does
but
as
it
is
i
sure
i
do
see
any
way
to
avoid
it
nor
i
cried
laura
sinking
still
deeper
in
despair
oh
dear
what
shall
i
do
in
novels
you
know
pursued
cornelia
where
there
a
cruel
tyrannical
father
like
your
sister
there
always
a
hero
in
love
with
the
heroine
i
sure
i
wish
there
was
a
hero
in
love
with
me
said
laura
thinking
of
her
own
hero
in
regimentals
i
run
away
with
him
she
added
with
animation
if
if
both
his
legs
were
shot
off
not
considering
duly
i
dare
say
how
greatly
such
a
dreadful
mutilation
however
glorious
in
itself
would
conflict
with
the
rapid
locomotion
essential
to
her
plan
of
elopement
but
when
tira
blake
came
to
be
told
of
laura
trouble
and
the
reasons
of
it
that
sage
and
prudent
friend
gave
counsel
that
cheered
her
like
a
cordial
telling
her
it
would
be
sinful
to
marry
a
man
whom
she
disliked
so
heartily
and
that
in
such
a
matter
no
one
had
the
right
to
demand
or
enforce
obedience
it
bad
enough
to
be
married
when
you
willin
said
she
but
when
you
willin
there
no
law
nor
no
gospel
to
make
you
but
if
maria
should
compel
me
what
should
i
do
cried
laura
to
whom
her
sister
will
seemed
more
mighty
than
both
law
and
gospel
she
ca
replied
statira
sententiously
she
ca
her
in
such
a
case
is
only
good
for
herself
it
ca
make
you
any
man
what
shall
you
do
why
nothin
nothin
in
the
world
if
they
should
bring
bridegroom
and
parson
and
stand
you
up
side
of
him
by
main
force
which
of
course
is
foolish
to
think
of
their
doing
so
only
i
suppose
it
just
to
show
you
what
i
mean
even
in
such
a
case
you
need
do
anything
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
your
head
from
bobbin
and
there
lawyers
nor
squires
nor
parsons
nor
parsons
wives
either
for
that
matter
enough
in
all
connecticut
to
marry
you
to
a
mouse
let
alone
a
man
humph
added
miss
blake
with
scornful
accent
i
should
like
to
see
set
out
to
marry
me
to
anybody
i
did
want
to
have
there
was
nothing
in
all
that
tira
said
which
laura
did
not
know
before
but
it
was
uttered
in
such
a
way
that
it
sounded
in
her
ears
like
a
new
revelation
filling
her
heart
with
peace
and
comfort
and
inspiring
her
with
hope
and
courage
the
magic
spell
that
had
enthralled
her
spirit
was
broken
by
the
power
of
a
few
cheery
confident
assuring
words
a
heavy
weight
seemed
lifted
from
her
heart
and
relieved
from
the
pressure
her
spirits
rose
joyous
and
elastic
the
shadow
was
dispelled
which
had
darkened
her
future
and
the
sun
seemed
to
shine
brighter
and
the
birds
to
sing
more
sweetly
she
herself
was
changed
or
at
least
it
was
hard
to
believe
she
was
the
same
laura
stebbins
who
the
night
before
had
cried
herself
to
sleep
and
whose
doleful
visage
that
very
morning
had
looked
out
at
her
from
the
mirror
she
flew
at
tira
in
a
transport
and
without
asking
her
leave
kissed
her
twenty
times
in
less
than
a
minute
after
a
fashion
that
i
say
it
with
reverence
would
have
tantalized
even
a
deacon
she
clapped
her
hands
she
laughed
she
danced
she
went
swaying
on
tiptoe
around
the
room
with
a
jaunty
step
singing
and
keeping
time
to
a
waltz
tune
and
finally
pausing
near
the
window
she
doubled
a
tiny
fist
as
white
as
a
snowball
bringing
it
down
into
the
rosy
palm
of
her
other
hand
with
a
gesture
of
resolute
determination
at
the
same
time
uttering
through
closed
teeth
and
with
compressed
and
puckered
lips
an
vow
that
never
the
longest
day
she
lived
would
she
marry
elam
hunt
to
please
anybody
as
her
sister
maria
said
she
with
a
saucy
toss
of
the
head
would
find
if
she
tried
to
make
her
i
doubt
greatly
whether
if
laura
had
known
what
i
am
now
going
to
tell
my
reader
she
would
have
indulged
in
such
vivacious
pranks
and
bold
defiant
words
namely
that
jaynes
was
hearing
everything
she
said
and
in
fact
had
listened
to
and
taken
special
heed
of
nearly
the
whole
conversation
a
part
of
which
has
been
set
forth
above
coming
through
the
wicket
in
the
garden
fence
on
an
errand
to
the
bugbee
kitchen
the
sound
of
her
own
name
in
excited
tones
struck
jaynes
ear
and
excited
her
curiosity
walking
nearer
to
the
house
and
concealing
herself
behind
a
little
thicket
of
lilac
bushes
near
the
open
window
of
statira
bedroom
she
was
enabled
to
hear
with
distinctness
almost
every
word
uttered
by
the
unconscious
conspirators
who
were
plotting
against
the
fulfilment
of
her
cherished
project
there
is
good
reason
for
believing
that
what
jaynes
overheard
while
lying
in
ambush
as
has
been
related
excited
in
her
heart
emotions
of
indignation
and
resentment
be
that
as
it
may
no
trace
of
displeasure
was
visible
upon
her
face
or
in
her
voice
or
manner
when
a
few
minutes
afterwards
she
stood
by
the
side
of
the
unsuspicious
tira
in
the
back
veranda
of
the
house
holding
in
her
hand
a
plate
containing
a
pat
of
butter
she
had
just
borrowed
from
the
doctor
housekeeper
while
the
latter
peeping
through
the
curtain
of
gazed
at
as
pretty
a
spectacle
as
just
then
could
have
been
seen
anywhere
in
belfield
on
the
grassplot
in
the
shade
of
a
great
laura
and
helen
were
playing
at
graces
both
were
full
of
frolicsome
glee
the
former
with
spirits
in
their
first
glad
rebound
from
recent
despondency
being
wild
with
gayety
enjoying
the
sport
no
less
than
the
merry
child
her
playmate
laura
glowing
face
was
fairly
radiant
with
beauty
and
her
figure
was
unconsciously
displayed
in
such
a
variety
of
bewitching
attitudes
and
dainty
postures
that
even
a
pair
of
frisky
kittens
that
had
been
chasing
each
other
round
the
grassplot
and
up
and
down
the
stems
of
the
ceased
their
gambols
and
lay
still
crouching
in
the
grass
and
watching
her
graceful
motions
as
if
taking
heed
for
future
imitation
if
kit
and
tabby
really
did
regard
laura
with
admiration
and
complacency
it
was
more
than
i
can
say
for
jaynes
in
whose
heart
a
secret
rage
was
burning
though
her
aspect
and
demeanor
were
as
placid
and
demure
as
if
the
butter
she
held
in
her
hand
would
not
have
melted
in
her
mouth
jaynes
for
reasons
of
her
own
thought
proper
to
keep
her
temper
in
control
abstaining
from
any
manifestation
of
displeasure
for
a
much
longer
time
than
while
she
remained
standing
in
the
back
veranda
of
doctor
bugbee
house
she
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
apprise
laura
that
her
rebellious
conference
with
statira
had
been
discovered
nor
to
forbid
her
from
holding
further
communication
with
her
evil
counsellors
but
contented
herself
for
the
present
with
keeping
a
stricter
watch
over
her
sister
conduct
by
practising
with
increased
rigor
and
vigilance
that
efficient
system
of
tactics
hereinbefore
commemorated
by
which
the
ardor
of
laura
chance
admirers
was
repressed
and
their
advances
repelled
and
by
alluding
from
time
to
time
to
prospective
nuptials
as
to
an
event
predestined
and
inevitable
or
at
least
no
less
sure
to
come
to
pass
than
if
laura
herself
had
engaged
her
hand
to
hunt
of
her
own
free
will
and
accord
and
was
only
waiting
to
be
asked
to
name
the
it
was
many
months
after
elam
left
the
shady
height
of
east
windsor
hill
before
he
received
a
call
to
settle
for
though
he
preached
in
different
parts
on
trial
before
many
congregations
that
were
destitute
of
pastors
none
of
these
fastidious
flocks
would
listen
to
his
voice
a
second
time
or
agree
to
choose
him
for
its
shepherd
at
last
however
the
people
of
walbury
a
town
in
windham
county
lying
nearly
twenty
miles
from
belfield
made
choice
of
hunt
to
be
their
spiritual
guide
and
accordingly
extended
to
him
an
invitation
to
be
ordained
and
installed
as
the
settled
minister
over
their
ancient
parish
upon
receiving
this
proposal
elam
at
once
despatched
a
letter
to
his
friend
and
ally
jaynes
informing
her
of
his
good
fortune
and
suggesting
that
laura
should
at
once
bestir
herself
in
preparations
for
their
wedding
in
order
that
this
blissful
event
might
precede
his
ordination
then
after
waiting
for
the
lapse
of
that
period
of
decorous
delay
which
immemorial
usage
has
prescribed
in
such
cases
he
indited
an
epistle
to
the
church
in
walbury
stating
in
proper
and
accustomed
form
that
his
native
humility
inclined
him
to
refuse
their
request
but
that
after
a
wrestle
with
his
inclinations
he
had
got
the
better
of
them
and
had
resolved
to
sacrifice
his
own
wishes
and
feelings
and
to
enter
the
field
of
labor
to
which
the
israel
in
walbury
had
invited
him
a
year
and
more
had
elapsed
since
laura
encouraged
by
tira
assuring
words
had
begun
to
hope
that
a
better
fate
was
in
store
for
her
than
to
become
the
wife
of
a
man
she
detested
meanwhile
elam
had
often
come
to
belfield
sometimes
preaching
a
sermon
for
jaynes
and
going
away
again
after
a
brief
sojourn
without
having
opened
his
mouth
to
laura
to
speak
of
love
or
marriage
at
his
later
visits
it
was
evident
that
he
was
inclined
to
despond
about
his
prospects
of
getting
a
settlement
and
laura
began
to
entertain
strong
hopes
that
he
never
would
be
successful
for
she
would
have
given
up
all
the
chances
of
beholding
her
military
hero
in
person
and
would
have
been
content
to
live
a
maid
forever
continually
waiting
for
elam
if
she
could
have
been
assured
the
time
would
never
come
for
him
to
claim
her
but
one
morning
after
breakfast
having
made
her
bed
and
arranged
her
chamber
singing
blithely
all
the
while
she
was
just
going
to
sit
down
by
the
window
with
her
sewing
when
jaynes
came
in
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
laura
guessed
at
once
that
the
letter
was
from
elam
and
that
it
contained
the
news
of
which
the
reader
has
been
apprised
already
though
she
did
not
need
to
read
the
letter
in
order
to
inform
herself
of
its
contents
she
took
it
in
her
hand
when
her
sister
bade
her
read
it
and
made
a
pretence
of
obedience
shuddering
meanwhile
with
disgust
and
terror
at
last
she
came
to
the
conclusion
of
the
epistle
where
elam
had
mentioned
his
desire
to
be
married
before
being
ordained
and
had
subscribed
himself
as
united
in
gospel
bonds
to
the
worthy
lady
to
whom
the
letter
was
addressed
then
folding
up
the
paper
with
trembling
hands
she
held
it
towards
her
sister
without
daring
to
look
up
or
to
say
a
word
now
laura
asked
jaynes
in
a
quiet
tone
when
can
you
be
ready
to
be
married
laura
tried
to
speak
and
looked
up
with
a
pale
frightened
face
into
her
sister
impassive
countenance
her
white
lips
failed
to
form
the
words
she
strove
to
utter
when
shall
the
wedding
be
said
jaynes
with
a
smile
of
affected
sportiveness
name
the
happy
day
my
love
happy
day
repeated
poor
laura
oh
maria
why
what
the
matter
child
said
jaynes
what
are
you
crying
for
oh
dear
dear
sister
sobbed
laura
falling
on
her
knees
at
jaynes
feet
do
hear
me
you
are
my
mother
for
you
fill
her
place
i
have
endeavored
to
do
so
said
jaynes
then
for
god
sake
do
make
me
marry
this
horrid
man
pursued
laura
do
tell
me
that
i
must
do
force
me
to
such
a
fate
and
with
many
passionate
words
like
these
laura
implored
her
sister
not
to
lay
any
command
upon
her
to
marry
elam
hunt
hush
laura
hush
my
dear
child
said
jaynes
who
had
anticipated
this
scene
and
was
well
prepared
with
her
replies
be
calm
you
behave
absurdly
i
have
no
power
to
force
you
to
marry
any
man
i
do
expect
to
compel
you
to
accept
hunt
for
a
husband
for
at
least
two
years
past
i
had
supposed
however
that
it
was
your
intention
to
do
so
if
you
have
changed
your
mind
and
if
you
wish
to
break
an
engagement
that
has
subsisted
so
long
whether
for
or
without
cause
i
can
not
prevent
it
you
have
read
so
many
foolish
romances
that
your
head
is
turned
and
you
fancy
yourself
a
heroine
in
distress
but
let
me
tell
you
my
dear
that
in
real
life
here
in
new
england
a
woman
can
not
be
forced
to
marry
so
calm
your
transports
wipe
your
eyes
and
get
up
from
your
knees
i
not
to
be
kneeled
to
pray
remember
laura
did
as
she
was
told
so
much
abashed
that
she
dared
not
look
up
to
increase
her
confusion
her
sister
began
to
laugh
i
beg
your
pardon
dear
said
she
but
ha
ha
ha
it
was
so
funny
like
a
scene
in
a
play
i
should
think
i
know
i
been
silly
maria
said
laura
weeping
again
with
shame
this
time
never
mind
dear
said
her
sister
in
a
kind
tone
we
all
silly
sometimes
you
never
be
guilty
of
the
folly
again
at
any
rate
of
supposing
that
girls
can
be
married
in
spite
of
themselves
by
cruel
sisters
eh
laura
oh
maria
do
forgive
me
cried
laura
blushing
crimson
i
was
so
very
silly
well
let
it
all
go
said
jaynes
kissing
her
now
talk
about
this
letter
tell
me
why
you
do
wish
to
marry
hunt
if
you
have
any
good
reason
against
it
i
sure
i
do
desire
it
though
i
confess
having
supposed
so
long
it
was
a
settled
thing
i
had
set
my
heart
upon
it
perhaps
this
disappointment
has
been
sent
to
me
for
some
wise
purpose
added
jaynes
with
a
pious
sigh
thus
encouraged
laura
opened
her
heart
and
began
to
talk
saying
that
she
did
like
hunt
that
she
did
love
him
that
she
disliked
him
and
hated
him
and
that
he
was
hateful
and
horrid
and
awful
and
dreadful
and
so
homely
and
pale
and
pimpled
and
ugh
she
should
never
like
him
nor
love
him
but
always
dislike
him
and
hate
him
and
on
she
went
in
this
manner
till
her
fervor
was
cooled
and
she
had
exhausted
by
frequent
repetition
every
form
of
speech
capable
of
expressing
her
great
repugnance
to
a
union
with
elam
hunt
in
conclusion
she
said
she
was
willing
never
to
marry
but
would
remain
with
her
sister
and
work
for
her
and
the
children
all
her
life
thank
you
dear
said
jaynes
we
talk
of
your
kind
offer
presently
and
you
will
see
i
think
that
i
have
no
desire
that
you
should
live
and
die
an
old
maid
even
in
case
you
do
not
marry
mr
hunt
i
sure
i
rather
than
not
said
laura
with
a
twinge
of
conscience
at
the
thought
of
her
hero
have
you
said
all
that
you
got
to
say
asked
jaynes
very
quietly
laura
looked
up
into
her
sister
grave
sober
face
and
felt
a
chill
of
vague
apprehension
begin
to
take
the
place
of
the
hopeful
glow
in
her
heart
eh
said
jaynes
inquiringly
y
yes
faltered
laura
only
this
i
do
like
him
and
such
a
horrid
disgusting
man
and
and
that
all
i
believe
except
that
i
do
like
him
and
think
he
so
disagreeable
and
oh
yes
there
another
thing
he
wears
blue
spectacles
ugh
spectacles
is
there
anything
more
said
jaynes
still
speaking
with
the
same
even
quiet
voice
n
no
said
laura
only
i
and
here
she
paused
do
like
him
added
jaynes
supplying
the
words
yes
that
it
said
laura
i
know
i
foolish
but
it
much
to
confess
it
said
jaynes
now
that
patiently
heard
all
that
you
have
to
say
i
wish
to
be
heard
a
few
words
in
favor
of
a
dear
and
worthy
friend
of
mine
against
whom
you
appear
to
entertain
a
groundless
antipathy
no
not
groundless
interposed
laura
well
i
agree
that
a
pale
studious
face
and
blue
spectacles
are
good
reasons
for
hating
a
man
now
let
me
say
a
word
or
two
in
his
favor
notwithstanding
and
also
in
favor
of
a
plan
which
i
had
supposed
was
agreed
upon
and
which
i
dislike
extremely
to
see
abandoned
you
have
reasons
against
it
which
you
have
stated
i
have
reasons
for
it
which
i
will
state
but
first
answer
me
two
or
three
simple
questions
or
will
you
dear
and
laura
assenting
she
went
on
to
ask
if
hunt
was
not
good
and
pious
and
of
blameless
life
and
reputation
extorting
from
laura
an
affirmative
reply
to
each
separate
inquiry
he
all
these
good
qualities
then
to
offset
the
complexion
of
his
face
and
spectacles
resumed
jaynes
now
let
us
look
at
the
matter
in
a
worldly
point
of
view
he
is
able
to
give
you
not
only
a
place
but
the
very
highest
position
in
society
he
can
offer
you
not
wealth
but
competence
which
is
better
than
either
poverty
or
riches
why
my
dear
there
are
a
hundred
girls
in
this
town
many
of
whom
excel
you
in
everything
which
men
think
desirable
in
a
wife
except
perhaps
the
poor
perishable
quality
of
beauty
girls
of
good
family
rich
or
likely
to
be
so
intelligent
well
educated
some
of
them
to
say
the
least
almost
as
pretty
as
you
any
one
of
whom
would
think
herself
honored
by
this
offer
which
you
despise
for
most
people
are
aware
that
to
be
a
minister
wife
in
new
england
is
my
dear
to
occupy
as
i
have
just
said
the
very
summit
of
the
social
structure
here
jaynes
made
a
period
and
watched
the
effect
of
her
words
after
a
pause
she
resumed
by
alluding
to
laura
offer
to
remain
with
her
always
without
marrying
and
while
poor
laura
listened
with
a
feeling
as
if
the
very
earth
was
sinking
beneath
her
feet
jaynes
reminded
her
that
she
was
a
penniless
orphan
who
had
been
maintained
for
years
by
the
bounty
of
one
upon
whom
she
had
no
claim
except
that
she
was
the
sister
of
his
wife
i
have
no
right
you
know
my
dear
continued
jaynes
to
tell
you
that
you
may
stay
here
longer
jabez
doubtless
would
bid
you
remain
and
welcome
as
he
told
you
to
come
and
welcome
but
young
women
are
usually
expected
to
marry
at
or
near
your
age
it
is
probable
indeed
i
know
that
at
the
time
you
came
this
event
was
thought
of
and
taken
into
account
jaynes
is
warm
friend
and
admirer
he
expects
that
you
are
going
to
marry
this
good
friend
what
will
be
his
reflections
when
he
learns
that
you
prefer
to
remain
here
a
pensioner
upon
his
income
rather
than
to
marry
such
a
man
as
hunt
whose
only
demerits
are
his
blue
spectacles
and
pale
complexion
here
laura
turned
so
white
and
looked
so
woful
that
her
tormentor
paused
in
apprehension
that
the
poor
girl
was
going
to
swoon
oh
my
god
what
shall
i
do
cried
laura
beating
her
palms
together
in
sore
distress
you
know
resumed
jaynes
watching
her
sister
carefully
and
speaking
softly
you
know
that
jaynes
salary
is
not
large
it
used
to
be
more
than
sufficient
for
our
wants
but
the
children
are
getting
to
be
more
expensive
every
year
their
clothes
cost
more
and
the
boys
at
least
ought
soon
to
go
away
to
school
and
jabez
has
set
his
heart
upon
sending
newton
to
college
if
well
never
mind
dear
i
say
no
more
but
when
i
think
of
this
offer
of
hunt
such
a
good
offer
especially
to
one
in
your
circumstances
from
such
a
worthy
talented
pious
young
clergyman
whose
preference
julia
bramhall
or
cornelia
bugbee
with
their
thousands
would
be
glad
to
win
who
is
going
to
be
settled
in
a
good
old
parish
like
walbury
and
receive
at
once
a
salary
almost
as
large
i
dare
say
as
jaynes
i
say
laura
that
you
ought
to
give
better
reasons
for
refusing
him
nay
for
jilting
him
after
a
engagement
than
that
his
cheeks
are
pale
and
his
spectacles
blue
we
love
you
laura
and
are
willing
to
give
you
a
home
and
the
best
we
can
afford
to
eat
and
drink
and
wear
but
hunt
loves
you
as
well
or
better
and
offers
you
more
than
we
have
it
in
our
power
to
bestow
take
the
day
for
reflection
hunt
will
be
here
think
my
child
whether
you
will
be
justified
in
rejecting
this
offer
your
refusal
bear
in
mind
imposes
upon
others
a
sacrifice
of
something
more
than
childish
whims
and
silly
prejudices
in
order
that
you
may
have
time
and
opportunity
to
give
this
important
matter
due
consideration
you
had
better
remain
in
your
chamber
but
do
fancy
yourself
a
prisoner
if
you
choose
to
see
any
one
that
calls
you
can
do
so
but
my
dear
i
can
not
permit
you
to
go
and
seek
those
who
from
spite
and
malice
against
me
would
take
delight
in
giving
you
evil
counsel
with
this
sharp
innuendo
against
tira
blake
in
which
she
thought
she
might
now
safely
indulge
jaynes
concluded
her
speech
and
went
out
softly
leaving
poor
laura
in
a
stupor
of
despair
sitting
with
her
hands
clasped
in
her
lap
and
her
head
drooping
on
her
bosom
at
last
looking
up
with
a
glance
so
woful
that
one
would
scarcely
have
known
her
laura
perceived
she
was
alone
she
rose
went
to
the
door
and
locked
it
standing
for
a
moment
trembling
until
of
a
sudden
she
fell
piteously
and
began
to
walk
to
and
fro
across
her
chamber
wringing
her
hands
like
one
distraught
and
sometimes
throwing
herself
upon
the
bed
wailing
and
moaning
all
the
while
as
if
her
heart
would
break
indeed
and
truly
she
had
some
reason
for
the
violence
of
her
grief
not
being
a
thoughtful
person
nor
given
to
meditation
she
had
never
before
duly
considered
that
her
maintenance
was
a
matter
of
cost
and
calculation
to
those
who
provided
it
nor
reflected
that
she
had
no
rightful
claim
upon
those
who
gave
her
shelter
food
and
clothing
she
had
been
thankful
to
her
protectors
for
their
kindness
but
the
sentiment
she
entertained
for
them
was
more
like
filial
love
than
gratitude
for
the
first
time
she
realized
that
she
was
a
pensioner
on
another
bounty
and
felt
the
sharp
sting
of
conscious
dependence
at
length
growing
more
calm
after
the
first
passionate
outbreak
of
frantic
sorrow
had
subsided
she
dried
her
eyes
and
sat
down
on
purpose
to
think
poor
child
serious
deliberation
was
a
new
exercise
to
her
mind
besides
her
head
ached
her
brain
seemed
in
a
whirl
and
her
heart
was
so
full
and
heavy
she
wanted
to
do
nothing
but
cry
with
all
her
might
till
the
burden
was
gone
but
think
she
must
and
knitting
her
brows
and
stilling
her
sobs
she
tried
to
think
what
could
she
do
oh
if
she
could
but
ask
tira
but
what
good
could
tira
do
what
could
she
tell
her
it
was
not
her
sister
that
was
forcing
her
but
fate
itself
all
that
her
sister
had
told
her
was
true
every
word
the
tone
of
her
voice
her
manner
had
been
unusually
kind
and
gentle
there
was
nothing
she
had
said
that
she
could
be
blamed
for
saying
tira
herself
must
admit
that
it
was
all
true
and
reasonable
but
oh
how
very
dreadful
then
she
conjured
up
to
view
the
image
of
elam
hunt
his
lank
slim
figure
arrayed
in
sombre
black
his
pale
cadaverous
visage
spotted
with
pimples
and
blue
blotches
of
beard
his
spectral
glance
of
admiration
through
those
detestable
blue
spectacles
she
imagined
that
she
felt
the
clammy
touch
of
his
long
skinny
fingers
and
cold
flabby
palm
she
reflected
upon
the
probability
nay
the
certainty
that
she
must
marry
this
man
for
whom
she
felt
such
an
invincible
repugnance
and
in
a
frenzy
of
dismay
and
terror
she
screamed
aloud
and
started
up
as
if
to
fly
then
recollecting
herself
she
sank
down
oh
heavens
she
thought
there
was
no
escape
no
help
how
wretched
she
was
how
utterly
miserable
all
alone
alone
in
such
a
dreary
lonesome
world
with
no
home
nor
father
nor
mother
nor
brother
with
only
a
sister
who
had
a
husband
and
children
whom
she
loved
as
she
ought
far
better
than
she
did
her
there
was
nobody
to
whom
she
was
the
dearest
of
all
nobody
except
elam
hunt
whom
she
hated
and
loathed
with
all
her
heart
and
the
very
thought
of
whose
love
made
her
shudder
what
could
she
do
to
stay
and
be
a
burden
for
her
friends
to
support
was
worse
than
anything
that
at
least
she
was
resolved
to
do
no
longer
if
she
were
only
strong
enough
she
would
go
where
nobody
knew
her
and
work
at
housework
or
in
a
factory
or
anywhere
oh
if
she
only
knew
enough
to
teach
school
she
should
like
that
it
would
be
so
pleasant
to
have
the
children
love
her
and
bring
her
flowers
to
put
upon
her
desk
but
oh
dear
she
did
know
enough
she
feared
for
all
that
she
had
graduated
at
the
academy
she
never
dared
to
write
a
letter
without
looking
up
all
the
hard
words
of
it
in
the
dictionary
to
see
how
they
were
spelt
and
parsing
and
doing
sums
oh
gracious
she
never
could
teach
school
that
was
out
of
the
question
at
last
after
a
long
fit
of
silent
musing
during
which
she
had
bit
her
lips
and
frowned
and
gazed
abstractedly
at
the
wall
a
gleam
of
hope
lit
up
her
face
soon
brightening
into
a
smile
she
had
hit
upon
a
plan
she
could
learn
the
milliner
trade
she
had
always
been
handy
with
her
needle
and
liked
nothing
better
than
to
arrange
laces
and
ribbons
and
flowers
she
could
easily
learn
to
make
and
trim
a
bonnet
she
thought
at
least
she
could
try
at
first
it
would
come
hard
to
sit
cooped
up
in
those
little
back
shops
sewing
and
stitching
from
morning
till
night
but
it
was
better
than
marrying
elam
hunt
or
than
eating
other
people
bread
then
she
began
to
build
castles
in
the
air
as
her
custom
was
she
fancied
herself
a
milliner
apprentice
working
away
at
bonnets
and
caps
among
a
group
of
other
girls
sometimes
rising
to
attend
upon
a
customer
or
peeping
out
between
the
folds
of
a
curtain
at
people
in
the
front
shop
she
wondered
whether
cornelia
and
helen
would
be
ashamed
of
knowing
a
milliner
apprentice
if
they
should
chance
to
see
her
in
hartford
what
would
her
schoolmates
say
and
would
her
hero
despise
a
girl
that
worked
for
a
livelihood
then
she
whimpered
a
little
thinking
how
lonesome
she
would
be
for
a
while
among
strangers
but
it
was
a
kind
of
lamentation
that
differed
widely
from
the
frantic
weeping
of
the
morning
then
all
at
once
a
doubt
began
to
depress
her
hopes
could
she
get
a
place
she
was
a
stranger
in
hartford
and
beyond
that
city
she
dared
not
send
her
thoughts
could
tira
get
a
place
for
her
she
feared
not
for
tira
herself
seldom
went
to
the
city
but
there
was
doctor
bugbee
who
knew
a
great
many
people
there
and
who
was
so
rich
and
powerful
that
even
in
hartford
though
it
was
a
city
his
word
must
have
great
influence
besides
the
firm
of
bugbee
brothers
purchased
large
quantities
of
goods
at
some
of
the
great
millinery
shops
the
doctor
own
private
custom
was
not
small
for
cornelia
dressed
as
became
her
condition
and
even
little
helen
scorned
to
wear
a
bonnet
unless
it
came
from
hartford
doctor
bugbee
could
help
her
to
find
a
place
doubtless
he
would
be
willing
nay
even
glad
to
assist
her
in
her
trouble
at
any
rate
she
would
ask
him
but
how
was
she
to
see
him
he
was
not
likely
to
call
upon
her
unless
she
feigned
sickness
and
sent
for
him
for
her
sister
would
not
permit
her
to
go
to
his
house
where
she
would
be
sure
to
see
tira
besides
the
doctor
manner
had
of
late
grown
so
distant
and
forbidding
that
she
was
a
little
fearful
of
obtruding
herself
upon
his
notice
though
sorry
for
this
change
she
had
never
laid
it
so
much
to
heart
as
to
be
grieved
or
affronted
for
even
his
children
complained
of
his
altered
behavior
and
all
his
friends
had
noticed
the
gloomy
expression
which
his
face
sometimes
wore
but
now
she
troubled
herself
with
wondering
whether
she
had
given
him
any
cause
to
be
offended
with
her
perhaps
her
giddy
nonsense
and
thoughtless
gayety
which
when
he
himself
was
cheerful
and
happy
he
had
listened
to
without
displeasure
had
vexed
and
annoyed
him
in
his
moods
of
sadness
and
dejection
but
what
else
could
she
do
than
solicit
his
aid
the
favor
though
small
for
him
to
grant
would
be
of
immense
benefit
to
her
and
the
doctor
would
not
be
likely
to
refuse
she
would
tell
him
how
friendless
she
was
and
beg
him
to
help
the
fatherless
in
her
distress
she
knew
that
he
would
not
turn
her
away
at
all
events
she
could
try
coming
at
last
to
this
conclusion
and
wonderfully
cheered
and
strengthened
by
the
purpose
she
had
formed
she
washed
her
face
arranged
her
dishevelled
hair
and
smoothed
her
rumpled
dress
then
sitting
down
behind
the
she
began
to
watch
for
cornelia
hoping
her
friend
would
not
long
delay
her
accustomed
visit
to
the
parsonage
but
it
happened
that
cornelia
had
that
very
day
begun
a
novel
in
three
volumes
the
heroine
of
which
was
represented
to
be
a
young
lady
whose
extreme
beauty
and
amiable
temper
made
her
deserving
of
better
treatment
than
she
received
at
the
hands
of
the
author
who
suffered
her
to
be
cheated
and
bullied
by
a
scheming
and
brutal
guardian
to
be
slandered
by
his
envious
daughter
persecuted
by
a
dissolute
nobleman
haunted
by
a
spectre
shut
up
in
a
tower
exposed
to
manifold
dangers
beset
by
robbers
abducted
assaulted
barely
rescued
and
finally
even
teased
and
tormented
by
the
chosen
lover
of
her
heart
a
fellow
who
was
always
making
her
miserable
and
himself
ridiculous
by
his
absurd
suspicions
and
fractious
behavior
sympathizing
deeply
with
this
distressed
young
woman
whose
unexampled
misfortunes
and
troubles
would
have
touched
the
heart
of
even
a
marble
statue
cornelia
was
weeping
dolefully
over
a
page
near
the
end
of
the
second
volume
where
the
lady
lover
in
a
fit
of
senseless
jealousy
tears
her
miniature
from
his
bosom
renounces
her
affection
and
leaves
her
swooning
upon
the
floor
just
then
helen
rushed
into
her
chamber
with
a
summons
from
laura
to
hasten
at
once
to
her
side
for
laura
after
long
watching
had
caught
sight
of
helen
jumping
the
rope
on
the
grassplot
and
by
means
of
coughing
and
waving
her
handkerchief
from
the
window
had
attracted
the
notice
of
the
child
who
coming
to
the
paling
had
received
the
message
she
forthwith
bore
to
cornelia
adding
to
it
the
information
that
laura
eyes
appeared
to
be
almost
as
red
as
cornelia
own
staying
only
to
finish
the
volume
cornelia
repaired
to
comfort
and
console
her
friend
to
whose
chamber
she
found
ready
access
in
spite
of
some
vague
misgivings
in
jaynes
mind
but
shrewd
as
this
lady
was
by
nature
and
apprehensive
as
she
felt
that
some
untoward
accident
would
prevent
the
accomplishment
of
her
cherished
plans
she
never
dreamed
of
the
momentous
results
that
were
to
follow
this
interview
apparently
so
harmless
between
laura
and
her
friend
nor
would
it
be
fitting
to
suffer
an
account
of
so
important
a
conference
to
appear
at
the
end
of
a
chapter
to
be
continued
in
the
next
number
spartacus
the
romans
had
many
virtues
and
conspicuous
amongst
these
was
the
virtue
of
impartiality
they
treated
everybody
with
equal
inhumanity
they
were
as
pitiless
towards
the
humble
as
towards
the
proud
the
quality
of
mercy
was
utterly
unknown
to
them
their
motto
parcere
subjectis
et
debellare
superbos
powell
buxton
has
happily
translated
they
murdered
all
who
resisted
them
and
enslaved
the
rest
but
it
was
as
slaveholders
that
the
romans
most
clearly
exhibited
their
impartiality
they
were
above
those
miserable
subterfuges
that
are
so
common
with
americans
they
made
slaves
of
all
of
the
high
as
well
as
the
low
of
thracians
as
well
as
sardinians
of
greeks
and
syrians
as
readily
as
of
scythians
and
cappadocians
the
consequence
of
the
modes
by
which
the
romans
obtained
their
bondmen
by
war
by
purchase
and
by
kidnapping
affecting
as
they
did
the
most
cultivated
and
the
bravest
races
necessarily
made
slavery
a
very
dangerous
institution
greeks
and
gauls
thracians
and
syrians
germans
and
spaniards
were
not
likely
to
submit
their
necks
readily
to
the
yoke
they
rose
several
times
in
great
masses
and
contended
for
years
on
equal
terms
with
the
legions
some
of
their
number
exhibited
the
talents
of
statesmen
and
soldiers
at
the
head
of
armies
more
numerous
than
both
those
which
fought
at
cannae
one
of
them
showed
himself
to
be
a
born
soldier
and
caused
the
greatest
terror
to
be
felt
at
rome
that
had
been
known
there
since
that
day
on
which
hannibal
rode
up
to
the
colline
gate
and
cast
his
javelin
defiantly
into
that
city
which
he
himself
never
could
enter
the
treatment
of
their
slaves
by
the
romans
was
not
unlike
that
which
slaves
now
experience
some
masters
were
kind
and
there
are
many
facts
which
show
that
the
relations
between
master
and
slave
were
occasionally
of
the
most
amiable
nature
but
these
were
exceptional
cases
the
general
rule
being
cruelty
as
it
must
be
where
so
much
power
is
lodged
in
the
hands
of
one
class
of
men
and
the
other
has
only
a
nominal
protection
from
the
law
even
where
cruelty
takes
no
other
form
than
that
involved
in
hard
labor
the
slave
must
experience
intolerable
oppression
now
the
romans
were
the
most
avaricious
people
that
ever
lived
they
had
a
hearty
love
of
money
for
money
sake
they
would
do
anything
for
gold
such
men
were
not
likely
to
let
their
slaves
grow
fat
from
light
tasks
and
abundant
food
their
food
was
light
and
their
tasks
were
heavy
so
were
they
that
they
were
compelled
to
rob
on
the
highway
and
were
encouraged
to
do
so
by
their
owners
indeed
much
of
the
private
economy
of
the
romans
was
founded
on
cruelty
to
their
slaves
some
who
have
come
down
to
us
as
model
men
were
infamous
for
their
maltreatment
of
their
bondmen
the
life
of
any
foreigner
was
of
but
little
account
with
any
roman
but
enslaved
foreigners
were
regarded
as
on
a
level
with
brutes
many
anecdotes
are
related
of
the
ferocious
disregard
of
all
humanity
which
the
world
masters
manifested
towards
the
servile
classes
there
is
a
story
told
by
cicero
in
one
of
the
verrine
orations
which
peculiarly
illustrates
this
feature
of
the
roman
character
the
praetorian
edicts
forbade
slaves
to
carry
arms
there
were
no
exceptions
a
boar
of
great
size
was
once
given
to
lucius
domitius
who
was
a
sicilian
praetor
its
size
caused
him
to
ask
by
whom
it
was
slain
and
on
being
informed
that
the
hunter
was
a
shepherd
and
slave
he
sent
for
him
the
slave
not
doubting
that
he
should
be
rewarded
for
his
bravery
hastened
to
present
himself
before
the
praetor
who
asked
him
what
he
killed
the
animal
with
with
a
spear
was
the
answer
whereupon
the
praetor
ordered
that
he
should
be
immediately
crucified
this
was
but
one
of
thousands
of
similar
acts
that
were
perpetrated
by
romans
through
many
generations
the
slaves
as
we
have
remarked
occasionally
revolted
and
the
efforts
that
were
found
necessary
to
subdue
them
rose
sometimes
to
the
dignity
of
wars
the
first
servile
war
of
the
romans
occurred
in
sicily
there
were
various
reasons
why
this
fine
island
should
become
the
scene
of
servile
wars
sooner
than
other
portions
of
the
roman
dominions
upon
the
final
expulsion
of
the
carthaginians
about
the
middle
of
the
second
punic
war
great
changes
of
property
ensued
speculators
from
italy
rushed
into
the
island
who
says
arnold
in
the
general
distress
of
the
sicilians
bought
up
large
tracts
of
land
at
a
low
price
or
became
the
occupiers
of
estates
which
had
belonged
to
sicilians
of
the
carthaginian
party
and
had
been
forfeited
to
rome
after
the
execution
or
flight
of
their
owners
the
sicilians
of
the
roman
party
followed
the
example
and
became
rich
out
of
the
distress
of
their
countrymen
slaves
were
to
be
had
cheap
and
corn
was
likely
to
find
a
sure
market
whilst
italy
was
suffering
from
the
ravages
of
war
accordingly
sicily
was
crowded
with
slaves
employed
to
grow
corn
for
the
great
landed
proprietors
whether
sicilian
or
italian
and
so
by
their
masters
that
they
soon
began
to
provide
for
themselves
by
robbery
the
poorer
sicilians
were
the
sufferers
from
this
evil
and
as
the
masters
were
well
content
that
their
slaves
should
be
maintained
at
the
expense
of
others
they
were
at
no
pains
to
restrain
their
outrages
thus
although
nominally
at
peace
though
full
of
wealthy
proprietors
and
though
exporting
corn
largely
every
year
yet
sicily
was
teeming
with
evils
which
seventy
or
eighty
years
after
broke
out
in
the
horrible
atrocities
of
the
servile
war
footnote
arnold
of
vol
iii
pp
london
edition
the
sicilian
servile
war
began
only
a
few
years
after
the
destruction
of
carthage
and
corinth
and
when
the
military
power
of
the
republic
was
probably
at
its
height
though
military
discipline
may
have
been
somewhat
relaxed
from
the
old
standard
it
lasted
two
or
three
years
the
chief
of
the
slaves
had
at
one
time
two
hundred
thousand
followers
inclusive
probably
of
women
and
children
he
was
a
syrian
of
apamea
named
eunus
and
had
been
a
prophet
and
conjurer
among
the
slaves
to
his
prophecies
and
tricks
he
owed
his
elevation
when
the
rebellion
broke
out
according
to
some
accounts
he
was
rather
a
cunning
than
an
able
man
but
it
should
be
recollected
that
his
enemies
only
have
drawn
his
portrait
the
victories
he
so
often
won
over
the
roman
forces
are
placed
to
the
credit
of
his
lieutenant
a
cilician
of
the
name
of
cleon
but
he
must
have
been
a
man
of
considerable
ability
to
have
maintained
his
position
so
long
and
to
have
commanded
the
services
of
those
said
to
have
been
his
superiors
cleon
superiority
was
probably
only
that
of
the
soldier
he
fell
in
battle
and
eunus
was
made
prisoner
but
died
before
he
could
be
brought
to
punishment
no
doubt
to
the
vast
regret
of
his
savage
captors
in
the
year
another
servile
war
broke
out
in
sicily
and
was
not
brought
to
an
end
until
after
four
years
of
hard
fighting
the
leaders
were
salvius
or
tryphon
an
italian
and
athenion
a
cilician
or
greek
both
showed
considerable
talent
but
owed
their
leadership
salvius
to
his
knowledge
of
divination
and
athenion
to
his
pretensions
to
astrology
they
were
often
successful
and
it
was
not
until
a
consul
had
taken
the
field
against
them
that
the
slaves
were
subdued
the
chiefs
having
successively
fallen
and
no
one
arising
to
make
their
place
good
the
next
great
servile
war
was
on
a
grander
scale
though
briefer
than
either
of
the
sicilian
contests
its
scene
was
italy
and
it
was
conducted
on
the
part
of
the
rebels
by
the
profoundest
military
genius
ever
encountered
by
the
romans
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
hannibal
we
speak
of
spartacus
who
defeated
many
roman
armies
and
disputed
with
the
republic
the
dominion
of
the
italian
peninsula
and
with
it
that
of
the
civilized
world
this
war
took
place
while
rome
was
engaged
in
hostilities
with
sertorius
and
mithridates
and
it
was
brought
to
an
end
only
by
the
exertions
of
the
ablest
generals
the
republic
then
had
the
great
pompeius
having
been
summoned
from
spain
and
it
being
in
contemplation
to
order
home
lucullus
from
the
east
in
the
war
with
hannibal
the
romans
showed
their
fearlessness
by
sending
troops
to
spain
while
the
carthaginian
with
his
army
was
lying
under
their
walls
but
they
called
troops
and
generals
from
spain
to
their
assistance
against
the
thracian
gladiator
he
must
have
been
a
man
of
extraordinary
powers
to
have
accomplished
so
much
with
the
means
at
his
disposal
it
has
been
regarded
as
a
proof
of
the
astonishing
powers
of
hannibal
as
a
commander
that
he
could
keep
together
and
in
effective
condition
an
army
composed
of
the
outcasts
as
it
were
of
many
nations
and
win
with
it
great
victories
scattered
over
a
long
period
of
time
yet
this
was
less
than
was
done
by
spartacus
the
carthaginian
like
alexander
succeeded
to
an
army
formed
by
his
father
next
after
himself
the
ablest
man
of
the
age
the
thracian
without
country
or
home
and
an
outlaw
from
the
beginning
of
his
enterprise
had
to
create
an
army
and
that
out
of
the
most
heterogeneous
and
apparently
the
most
unpromising
materials
the
palm
must
be
aligned
to
the
latter
to
what
race
did
spartacus
belong
we
are
told
that
he
was
a
thracian
his
family
being
shepherds
the
thracians
were
a
brave
people
but
by
no
means
remarkable
for
the
highest
intellectual
superiority
yet
spartacus
was
eminently
a
man
of
mind
with
large
views
and
an
original
genius
for
organization
and
war
plutarch
pays
him
the
highest
compliment
in
his
power
by
admitting
that
he
deserved
to
be
regarded
as
belonging
to
the
hellenic
race
he
was
says
the
old
lifemaker
a
man
not
only
of
great
courage
and
strength
but
in
judgment
and
mildness
of
character
superior
to
his
condition
and
more
like
a
greek
than
one
would
expect
from
his
nation
it
is
not
impossible
that
he
had
greek
blood
in
his
veins
thrace
was
hard
by
greece
had
many
greek
cities
and
its
full
proportion
of
those
greek
adventurers
military
and
civil
who
were
to
be
found
in
every
country
and
city
from
spain
to
persia
from
gades
to
ecbatana
what
more
probable
than
that
among
his
ancestors
were
greeks
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
thracians
themselves
were
capable
of
producing
eminent
men
being
a
superior
physical
race
and
prevented
only
by
the
force
of
circumstances
from
attaining
to
a
respectable
position
they
were
renowned
for
soldierlike
qualities
which
caused
the
romans
to
give
them
the
preference
as
gladiators
a
dubious
honor
to
say
the
best
of
it
how
and
under
what
circumstances
spartacus
became
a
gladiator
is
a
point
by
no
means
clear
we
can
not
trust
the
roman
accounts
as
it
was
a
meritorious
thing
in
the
opinion
of
a
roman
for
a
man
to
lie
for
his
country
as
well
as
to
die
for
it
florus
states
that
he
was
first
a
thracian
mercenary
then
a
roman
soldier
then
a
deserter
and
robber
and
then
because
of
his
strength
a
gladiator
from
choice
but
to
say
nothing
of
the
national
prejudices
of
florus
he
writes
like
a
man
who
felt
it
to
be
a
particular
grievance
that
romans
should
have
been
compelled
to
fight
slaves
and
particularly
gladiators
this
is
in
striking
contrast
with
plutarch
who
was
a
contemporary
of
florus
but
whose
patriotic
pride
was
not
wounded
by
the
victories
which
the
thracian
gladiator
won
over
roman
generals
indeed
as
he
was
willing
to
admit
that
spartacus
ought
to
have
been
a
greek
we
may
suppose
that
he
was
pleased
to
read
of
his
victories
a
not
unnatural
thing
in
a
provincial
and
particularly
in
a
greek
who
knew
so
well
what
his
country
had
once
been
plutarch
says
not
a
word
about
the
thracian
having
been
a
soldier
and
a
thief
but
introduces
him
with
one
of
his
good
stories
they
say
he
tells
us
that
when
spartacus
was
first
taken
to
rome
to
be
sold
a
snake
was
seen
folded
over
his
face
while
he
was
sleeping
and
a
woman
of
the
same
tribe
with
spartacus
who
was
skilled
in
divination
and
possessed
by
the
mysterious
rites
of
dionysus
declared
that
this
was
a
sign
of
a
great
and
formidable
power
which
would
attend
him
to
a
happy
termination
she
was
the
thracian
wife
or
mistress
being
connected
with
him
by
some
tender
tie
and
was
with
him
when
he
subsequently
escaped
from
capua
in
the
bloody
drama
of
the
war
of
spartacus
hers
is
the
sole
relieving
figure
and
we
would
fain
know
more
of
her
for
it
could
have
been
no
ordinary
woman
who
was
loved
by
such
a
man
the
passion
of
the
romans
for
gladiatorial
combats
is
well
known
not
a
few
persons
followed
the
calling
of
and
had
whole
corps
of
these
doomed
men
whom
they
let
to
those
who
wished
to
get
up
such
shows
there
were
several
schools
of
gladiators
the
chief
of
which
were
at
ravenna
and
capua
where
garrisons
were
maintained
to
keep
the
pupils
in
subjection
according
to
one
account
spartacus
while
on
a
predatory
incursion
was
made
prisoner
and
afterwards
sold
to
cneius
lentulus
batiatus
a
trainer
of
gladiators
who
sent
him
to
his
school
at
capua
he
was
to
have
fought
at
rome
but
he
had
higher
thoughts
than
of
submitting
to
so
degrading
a
destiny
as
the
being
butchered
to
make
a
roman
holiday
most
of
his
companions
were
gauls
and
thracians
the
bravest
of
men
who
bore
confinement
with
small
patience
they
conspired
to
make
their
escape
the
chief
conspirators
being
spartacus
and
two
others
who
were
subsequently
made
his
lieutenants
crixus
a
gaul
and
oenomaus
a
greek
some
two
hundred
persons
were
in
the
conspiracy
but
only
a
portion
of
them
succeeded
in
breaking
the
school
bounds
florus
says
that
not
more
than
thirty
got
out
while
velleius
makes
the
number
to
have
been
and
plutarch
having
armed
themselves
with
spits
knives
and
cleavers
from
a
cook
shop
they
hastened
out
of
capua
passing
along
the
appian
way
they
fell
in
with
a
number
of
wagons
loaded
with
gladiators
weapons
which
they
seized
and
were
thus
placed
in
good
fighting
condition
shortly
after
this
they
encountered
a
small
body
of
soldiers
whom
they
routed
and
whose
arms
they
substituted
for
the
gladiatorial
deeming
these
no
longer
worthy
of
them
they
were
now
joined
by
a
few
others
fugitives
and
mountaineers
with
whom
they
took
refuge
in
the
crater
of
vesuvius
then
as
from
time
immemorial
and
for
nearly
a
century
and
a
half
later
inactive
thence
under
the
leadership
of
spartacus
and
his
lieutenants
crixus
and
oedomaus
they
ravaged
the
country
but
it
is
not
probable
that
they
caused
much
alarm
their
number
being
only
two
hundred
and
such
collections
of
slaves
being
by
no
means
uncommon
the
romans
little
dreamed
that
they
were
on
the
eve
of
one
of
the
most
terrible
of
their
many
wars
claudius
pulcher
one
of
the
praetors
was
sent
against
the
robbers
as
they
were
considered
to
be
he
found
them
so
advantageously
posted
on
the
mountain
that
though
superior
to
them
in
numbers
in
the
ratio
of
fifteen
to
one
he
resolved
to
blockade
them
and
so
compel
them
to
descend
to
the
plain
and
fight
at
disadvantage
or
starve
but
he
was
contending
with
a
man
of
genius
against
whom
even
rome
military
system
could
not
then
succeed
he
despised
his
enemy
a
sort
of
gratification
which
to
those
indulging
in
it
generally
costs
very
dear
spartacus
caused
ropes
to
be
made
of
vine
branches
with
the
aid
of
which
he
and
his
followers
lowered
themselves
to
the
base
of
the
mountain
at
a
point
which
had
been
left
unguarded
by
the
romans
because
considered
inaccessible
by
the
who
commanded
them
and
consequently
affording
a
capital
outlet
for
bold
men
under
a
daring
leader
in
the
dead
of
night
the
gladiators
stole
round
to
the
rear
of
the
roman
camp
and
assailed
it
taken
by
surprise
and
heavy
with
sleep
the
romans
were
routed
like
sheep
and
their
arms
and
baggage
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
despised
enemy
spartacus
saw
now
that
it
was
time
for
him
and
his
comrades
to
assume
a
higher
character
than
had
hitherto
belonged
to
them
instead
of
a
leader
of
outlaws
he
aspired
to
be
the
liberator
of
the
servile
population
of
italy
he
issued
a
proclamation
in
which
while
calling
upon
his
followers
to
remember
the
multitudes
who
groaned
in
chains
he
urged
the
slaves
to
rise
pointing
out
how
strong
they
were
and
how
weak
were
their
oppressors
maintaining
that
the
strength
of
the
masters
lay
in
the
blind
and
disgraceful
submission
of
the
slaves
at
the
same
time
declaring
that
the
land
belonged
of
right
to
the
bravest
a
sentiment
as
natural
and
proper
when
uttered
by
a
man
in
his
situation
as
it
is
base
when
proceeding
from
a
modern
buccaneer
who
has
taken
up
arms
not
to
obtain
his
own
freedom
but
to
enslave
others
the
whole
address
is
contemptuous
towards
the
romans
though
somewhat
too
rhetorical
for
a
man
in
the
situation
of
spartacus
it
is
the
composition
of
sallust
but
we
may
believe
that
it
expresses
the
sentiments
of
spartacus
as
sallust
was
not
only
his
contemporary
but
was
too
good
an
artist
to
disregard
keeping
in
what
he
wrote
italy
was
at
this
time
full
of
slaves
many
of
whom
must
have
been
men
of
quite
as
much
intelligence
as
the
romans
having
been
made
captives
in
war
the
free
population
of
the
peninsula
had
almost
entirely
disappeared
two
generations
before
tiberius
gracchus
had
pointed
to
the
miserable
condition
of
italy
and
to
the
fact
that
the
increase
of
the
slave
population
had
caused
the
italian
yeomanry
to
become
almost
extinct
in
the
years
that
had
passed
since
his
murder
the
work
of
extinction
had
gone
on
at
an
accelerated
rate
the
social
war
and
the
wars
of
sulla
and
marius
having
aided
slavery
to
do
its
perfect
work
in
this
way
had
perished
that
splendid
rural
population
from
which
the
roman
legionary
infantry
had
been
conscribed
and
which
had
enabled
the
aristocratical
republic
to
baffle
the
valor
of
samnium
the
skill
of
pyrrhus
and
the
genius
of
hannibal
even
so
early
as
in
the
first
of
the
eastern
wars
of
the
romans
immediately
after
the
second
defeat
of
carthage
there
were
indications
that
the
supply
of
roman
soldiers
was
giving
out
an
anecdote
of
the
younger
scipio
shows
what
must
have
been
the
character
of
a
large
part
of
the
roman
population
more
than
sixty
years
before
the
war
of
spartacus
when
he
declared
that
tiberius
gracchus
had
rightly
been
put
to
death
and
an
angry
shout
at
the
brutal
speech
came
from
the
people
he
turned
to
them
and
exclaimed
peace
ye
stepsons
of
italy
remember
who
it
was
that
brought
you
in
chains
to
rome
the
country
being
full
of
slaves
and
the
children
of
slaves
spartacus
had
little
difficulty
in
obtaining
recruits
apulia
was
particularly
fruitful
of
insurgents
in
that
country
the
vices
of
roman
slavery
were
displayed
in
all
their
naked
hideousness
and
the
apulian
shepherds
and
herdsmen
had
a
reputation
for
lawlessness
that
has
never
been
surpassed
yet
this
was
the
consequence
not
the
cause
of
their
bondage
it
is
related
that
some
of
them
having
asked
their
master
for
clothing
he
exclaimed
what
are
there
no
travellers
with
clothes
on
the
atrocious
hint
says
liddell
was
soon
taken
the
shepherd
slaves
of
lower
italy
became
banditti
and
to
travel
through
apulia
without
an
armed
retinue
was
a
perilous
adventure
from
assailing
travellers
the
marauders
began
to
plunder
the
smaller
and
all
but
the
rich
were
obliged
to
desert
the
country
and
flock
into
the
towns
so
early
as
the
year
seven
thousand
slaves
in
apulia
were
condemned
for
brigandage
by
a
praetor
sent
specially
to
restore
order
in
that
land
of
pasturage
when
they
were
not
employed
upon
the
hills
they
were
shut
up
in
large
buildings
where
they
talked
over
their
wrongs
and
formed
schemes
of
vengeance
the
century
and
more
between
this
date
and
the
appearance
of
spartacus
had
not
improved
the
condition
of
the
apulian
slaves
he
found
them
ripe
for
revolt
and
was
soon
joined
by
thousands
of
their
number
men
whose
modes
of
life
rendered
them
the
very
best
possible
material
for
soldiers
provided
they
could
be
induced
to
submit
to
the
restraints
of
discipline
they
were
strong
hardy
athletic
and
active
and
full
of
hatred
of
their
masters
it
shows
the
superiority
of
the
thracian
that
he
could
prevail
upon
them
to
act
in
a
regular
manner
he
formed
them
into
an
army
the
chief
officers
being
the
men
who
had
escaped
from
capua
in
his
company
this
army
had
some
discipline
which
was
the
more
easily
acquired
because
many
of
the
men
were
originally
soldiers
captives
of
the
roman
sword
but
the
hatred
of
all
in
it
to
the
romans

their
knowledge
that
they
had
to
choose
between
victory
and
the
crudest
forms
of
death
known

of

and
we
can
believe
that
he
did
so
without

that

calls

speaks
of
spartacus
is
not
only
amusing
as
an
instance
of
foolish
pride
but
is
curious
as
illustrating
a
change
in
roman
ideas
that
was
working
out
more
important
results
than
could
have
followed
from
all
the
acts
of
the
first
two
caesars
though
perhaps
it
was
in
some
sense
connected
with
if
not
dependent
upon
their
legislation
much
as
spartacus
had
done
and
signal
as
had
been
his
successes
it
was
not
yet
the
opinion
at
rome
that
he
was
a
formidable
foe
the
government
despatched
publius
varinius
glaber
to
act
against
him
at
the
head
of
ten
thousand
men
this
seems
a
small
force
yet
it
was
not
much
smaller
than
the
army
with
which
three
or
four
years
later
lucullus
overthrew
the
whole
military
power
of
the
armenian
monarchy
and
it
was
half
as
large
as
that
with
which
caesar
changed
the
fate
of
the
world
at
pharsalia
the
romans
probably
thought
it
strong
enough
to
subdue
all
the
slaves
in
italy
and
varinius
sufficiently
skilful
to
defeat
their
leaders
and
send
them
to
rome
in
chains
but
they
were
to
have
a
rough
awakening
from
their
dreams
of
invincibility
though
some
early
successes
of
varinius
for
a
time
apparently
justified
their
confidence
the
army
of
spartacus
numbered
forty
thousand
men
but
it
was
poorly
armed
and
its
discipline
was
very
imperfect
it
still
lacked
to
use
a
modern
term
the
baptism
of
fire
never
yet
having
been
matched
in
the
open
field
against
a
regular
force
its
arms
were
chiefly
agricultural
implements
and
wooden
pikes
that
had
been
made
by
hardening
the
points
of
stakes
with
fire
spartacus
resolved
upon
retreating
into
lucania
but
the
gauls
in
his
army
headed
by
his
lieutenant
crixus
pronounced
this
decision
cowardly
separated
themselves
from
the
main
body
attacked
the
romans
and
were
utterly
routed
the
retreat
to
lucania
was
then
made
in
perfect
safety
and
even
with
glory
apart
from
the
skill
with
which
it
was
conducted
watching
his
opportunity
and
showing
that
he
understood
the
military
principle
of
cutting
up
an
enemy
in
detail
spartacus
fell
upon
a
roman
detachment
two
thousand
strong
and
destroyed
it
shortly
after
this
the
roman
general
succeeded
as
he
thought
in
getting
him
into
a
trap
the
servile
encampment
was
upon
a
piece
of
ground
hemmed
in
on
one
side
by
mountains
on
the
other
by
impassable
waters
and
the
romans
were
about
to
close
up
the
only
outlets
with
some
of
those
grand
works
to
which
they
owed
so
many
of
their
conquests
when
one
night
spartacus
silently
retreated
leaving
his
camp
in
such
a
state
as
completely
deceived
the
enemy
who
did
not
discover
what
had
happened
until
the
next
morning
when
the
gladiators
were
beyond
their
reach
this
masterly
retreat
was
followed
up
by
a
brilliant
surprise
of
a
division
of
the
roman
army
under
the
command
of
cossinius
the
night
was
just
getting
in
and
the
soldiers
were
resting
from
their
march
and
from

cossinius

only
to

with

the

from

it

defeated

still

in

he
resolved
to
attack
varinius
sallust
represents
him
as
addressing
his
army
before
the
battle
and
telling
them
that
they
were
about
to
enter
not
upon
a
single
action
but
upon
a
long
war
that
from
success
then
would
follow
a
series
of
victories
and
that
therein
lay
their
only
salvation
from
a
death
at

excruciating
and
infamous
they
must
he
said
live
upon

after
victory
an
expression
that
showed
he
had
a
clear
comprehension
of
the
nature
of
his
situation
in
the
battle
that
followed
varinius
was
beaten
unhorsed
and
compelled
to
fly
for
his
life
all
his
personal
goods
fell
into
the
hands
of
spartacus
his
lictors
with
the
shared
the
same
fate
spartacus
assumed
the
dress
of
the
roman
and
all
the
ensigns
of
authority
he
has
been
censured
for
this
but
a
little
reflection
ought
to
convince
every
one
that
he
did
not
act
from
vanity
but
from
a
profound
appreciation
of
the
state
of
things
in
italy
the
slaves
of
which
his
army
was
composed
were
accustomed
to
see
the
emblems
of
authority
with
which
he
was
now
clothed
and
surrounded
in
the
possession
of
their
masters
alone
and
when
they
beheld
them
on
and
about
their
chief
they
were
not
only
reminded
of
the
governing
power
but
also
of
the
overthrow
of
those
who
had
therefore
monopolized
it
spartacus
was
a
statesman
and
knew
how
to
operate
on
the
minds
of
the
rude
masses
who
followed
him
and
obeyed
his
orders
the
defeat
of
varinius
left
the
whole
of
lower
lucania
at
the
mercy
of
the
gladiators
spartacus
now
established
posts
at
metapontum
and
at
thurii
here
he
labored
with
unceasing
energy
and
industry
to
organize
and
discipline
his
men
adopting
various
measures
to
prevent
them
from
becoming
enervated
through
the
abundance
in
which
they
were
revelling
he
prohibited
the
use
of
money
among
them
and
gave
all
that
he
himself
had
to
relieve
those
who
had
suffered
from
the
war
some
of
his
officers
are
said
to
have
followed
his
example
in
making
so
great
a
sacrifice
for
the
common
good
towards
the
close
of
the
year
varinius
had
succeeded
in
getting
another
army
on
foot
with
this
he
resolved
to
watch
the
enemy
repeated
defeats
having
made
the
romans
cautious
though
they
were
not
even
yet
seriously
alarmed
he
formed
and
fortified
a
camp
whence
he
kept
a
there
was
some
skirmishing
but
no
fighting
on
a
large
scale
this
did
not
suit
spartacus
who
had
become
confident
in
himself
and
his
men
he
desired
battle
but
wished
the
romans
should
take
the
initiative
and
was
convinced
that
the
near
approach
of
winter
would
compel
them
soon
to
fight
or
to
retreat
to
encourage
them
he
feigned
fear
and
commenced
a
retrograde
movement
but
no
sooner
had
the
elated
romans
advanced
in
pursuit
than
he
turned
upon
them
and
they
were
compelled
to
fight
under
circumstances
that
made
defeat
certain
this
second
rout
of
varinius
was
total
and
we
hear
no
more
of
him
never
had
there
been
a
more
successful
campaign
than
that
which
spartacus
had
just
closed
his
force
had
been
increased
from
less
than
one
hundred
men
to
nearly
one
hundred
thousand
he
had
proved
himself
more
than
the
equal
of
the
generals
who
had
been
sent
against
him
both
in
strategy
and
in
arms
he
had
fought
three
great
battles
and
numerous
lesser
actions
and
had
been
uniformly
successful
like
carnot
he
had
organized
victory
a
large
part
of
italy
was
at
his
command
and
under
any
other
circumstances
than
those
which
existed
or
against
any
other
foe
than
rome
he
would
probably
have
found
little
difficulty
in
establishing
a
powerful
state
the
origin
of
which
would
have
been
far
more
respectable
than
of
that
with
which
he
was
contending
but
he
was
a
statesman
and
knew
that
brilliant
as
were
his
successes
he
had
no
chance
of
accomplishing
anything
permanent
within
the
peninsula
he
was
fighting
too
for
freedom
not
for
dominion
his
plan
was
to
get
out
of
italy
two
courses
were
open
to
him
he
might
retreat
to
the
extremity
of
the
peninsula
cross
the
strait
that
separates
it
from
sicily
and
renew
the
servile
wars
of
that
island
or
he
might
march
north
force
his
way
out
of
italy
and
so
with
most
of
his
followers
reach
their
homes
in
gaul
and
thrace
the
latter
course
was
determined
upon
but
the
more
portion
of
his
men
the
gauls
were
opposed
to
it
and
resolved
to
march
upon
rome
a
division
of
the
victorious
army
ensued
the
larger
number
under
spartacus
proceeded
to
carry
out
the
wise
plan
of
their
leader
but
the
minority
refused
to
obey
him
we
have
seen
that
at
the
very
outset
of
his
enterprise
spartacus
encountered
opposition
from
the
gauls
in
his
army
who
were
ever
for
rash
measures
and
that
separating
themselves
from
their
associates
under
the
lead
of
crixus
they
had
been
defeated
crixus
rejoined
his
old
chieftain
and
did
good
service
but
he
and
his
countrymen
untaught
by
experience
and
inflated
with
a
notion
of
invincibility
on
what
founded
it
would
be
hard
to
say
would
not
aid
spartacus
in
his
prudent
attempt
to
lead
his
followers
out
of
italy
rome
was
their
object
and
to
the
number
of
thirty
thousand
they
separated
themselves
from
the
main
army
at
first
the
event
seemed
to
justify
their
decision
meeting
a
roman
army
commanded
by
the
prætor
arrius
on
the
borders
of
samnium
the
gauls
put
it
to
rout
and
the
victory
of
crixus
was
not
less
decisive
than
any
of
those
which
had
been
won
by
spartacus
but
this
splendid
dawn
was
soon
overcast
crixus
was
a
drunkard
and
while
sleeping
off
one
of
his
fits
of
intoxication
he
was
set
upon
by
a
roman
army
under
the
consul
gellius
he
was
killed
and
his
followers
either
shared
his
fate
or
were
totally
dispersed
this
was
the
first
great
victory
won
by
the
romans
in
the
war
the
defeat
of
varinius
aroused
the
roman
government
to
see
that
their
enemy
was
not
to
be
despised
and
revolted
slave
though
he
was
they
were
compelled
to
pay
him
the
respect
of
making
prodigious
efforts
to
effect
his
destruction
the
consuls
gellius
and
lentulus
were
charged
with
the
conduct
of
the
war
the
former
overthrew
the
gauls
the
latter
followed
spartacus
and
came
up
with
him
in
etruria
here
a
contest
of
pure
generalship
took
place
lentulus
was
determined
not
to
fight
until
gellius
whose
victory
he
knew
of
should
have
come
up
and
spartacus
was
equally
determined
that
fight
he
should
before
the
junction
could
be
effected
he
succeeded
in
blocking
up
the
road
by
which
gellius
was
advancing
unknown
to
lentulus
and
then
offered
the
latter
battle
supposing
that
his
colleague
would
join
him
in
the
course
of
the
action
the
roman
accepted
the
challenge
and
was
beaten
the
victors
then
marched
to
meet
gellius
who
was
served
after
the
same
manner
as
lentulus
spartacus
was
the
only
general
who
ever
defeated
two
great
roman
armies
each
headed
by
a
consul
on
the
same
day
and
in
different
battles
hannibal
austerlitz
cannae
approaches
nearest
to
this
exploit
of
the
thracian
but
on
that
field
the
two
consular
armies
were
united
under
the
command
of
varro
these
great
successes
were
soon
followed
by
the
defeat
of
two
lesser
roman
armies
combined
under
the
lead
of
the
praetor
manlius
and
the
proconsul
cassius
this
last
victory
not
only
left
the
whole
open
country
at
the
command
of
spartacus
but
also
the
road
to
rome
upon
which
city
he
now
resolved
to
march
it
would
have
been
wiser
had
he
persevered
in
his
original
plan
the
execution
of
which
his
victories
must
have
made
it
easy
to
carry
out
but
perhaps
success
had
its
usual
effect
even
on
his
mind
and
blinded
him
to
the
impossibility
of
permanent
triumph
in
italy
he
winnowed
his
army
dismissing
all
his
soldiers
except
such
as
were
distinguished
by
their
bravery
their
strength
and
their
intelligence
in
order
that
his
march
might
be
swift
he
caused
all
the
superfluous
baggage
to
be
destroyed
every
beast
of
burden
that
could
be
dispensed
with
was
slain
his
prisoners
were
disposed
of
after
the
same
fashion
in
a
modern
general
such
an
act
would
be
utterly
without
excuse
but
it
was
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
ancient
warfare
and
spartacus
probably
felt
far
more
regret
at
sacrificing
his
beasts
of
burden
than
he
experienced
in
consenting
to
if
he
did
not
order
the
butchery
of
some
thousands
of
men
whom
he
must
have
looked
upon
as
so
many
brutes
proceeding
to
the
south
spartacus
fell
in
with
a
great
roman
army
led
by
arrius
and
a
battle
was
fought
near
ancona
in
which
victory
was
true
to
the
gladiator
the
romans
were
not
only
beaten
their
army
was
utterly
destroyed
a
result
which
they
seem
to
have
felt
to
be
so
shameful
that
they
made
no
apologies
for
it
why
after
this
signal
victory
spartacus
did
not
forthwith
carry
out
his
grand
design
of
attacking
rome
a
design
every
way
so
worthy
of
his
genius
and
which
alone
could
give
him
a
chance
of
achieving
permanent
success
after
he
had
abandoned
the
idea
of
forcing
his
way
out
of
italy
by
a
northern
march
can
never
be
known
it
is
supposed
to
have
been
in
consequence
of
information
that
circumstances
had
now
placed
it
in
his
power
to
effect
a
passage
into
sicily
a
project
which
he
had
regarded
with
favor
at
an
earlier
period
at
this
time
the
cilician
pirates
had
the
command
of
the
mediterranean
which
they
held
until
they
were
conquered
some
years
later
by
pompeius
it
was
by
the
aid
of
these
men
that
spartacus
expected
to
carry
his
army
into
sicily
they
had
shipping
in
abundance
and
in
a
few
days
they
could
have
conveyed
a
hundred
thousand
men
across
the
narrow
strait
that
separates
sicily
from
italy
this
they
agreed
to
do
and
were
paid
in
advance
by
spartacus
though
it
is
probable
that
he
relied
less
upon
that
payment
for
their
assistance
than
upon
the
palpable
fact
that
their
interests
were
the
same
as
his
own
the
pirates
were
on
the
sea
what
the
gladiatorial
army
was
on
land
they
were
the
victims
of
roman
oppression
and
had
become
outlaws
because
the
world
law
was
against
them
a
union
of
their
fleets
which
numbered
more
than
a
thousand
vessels
with
the
army
of
spartacus
in
the
harbors
and
on
the
fields
of
sicily
would
perhaps
have
been
more
than
a
match
for
the
whole
power
of
rome
contending
as
the
republic
then
was
with
mithridates
and
bleeding
still
from
the
wounds
inflicted
by
marius
and
sulla
as
well
as
from
the
blows
of
spartacus
sicily
too
was
then
in
a
state
which
promised
well
for
the
design
of
the
thracian
verres
was
ruling
over
the
island
and
how
he
ruled
it
cicero
has
told
us
had
the
victorious
thracian
entered
the
island
both
the
free
population
and
the
slaves
would
have
risen
against
the
romans
a
new
state
might
have
been
formed
strong
both
in
fleets
and
in
armies
and
compelled
from
the
very
nature
of
its
origin
to
contend
to
the
death
with
its
old
oppressors
whatever
the
result
it
is
certain
that
a
long
sicilian
war
like
that
which
the
romans
had
been
compelled
to
wage
with
the
carthaginians
would
have
changed
the
course
of
history
by
directing
the
attention
and
the
energies
of
such
men
as
crassus
pompeius
and
caesar
to
very
different
fields
from
those
on
which
their
fame
and
power
were
won
but
it
was
not
to
be
there
was
work
for
rome
to
do
which
could
be
done
by
no
other
nation
the
power
that
had
been
found
superior
to
hannibal
was
not
to
fall
before
spartacus
or
even
to
have
its
course
stayed
materially
by
his
victories
he
marched
to
the
foot
of
italy
on
the
shore
of
the
strait
where
he
expected
to
find
his
supposed
naval
allies
he
was
disappointed
they
impolitic
no
less
than
faithless
broke
their
engagement
after
they
had
pocketed
the
sum
agreed
upon
for
their
services
it
was
impossible
for
spartacus
to
carry
out
his
design
for
not
only
had
he
no
vessels
but
his
followers
were
it
is
altogether
probable
incapable
of
building
them
the
romans
too
must
have
had
ships
in
the
strait
and
a
very
few
would
have
been
found
enough
to
keep
it
clear
of
the
unskilful
gladiators
even
had
the
latter
had
the
time
and
the
means
to
construct
boats
after
the
defeat
of
the
romans
under
arrius
the
senate
had
called
crassus
to
the
chief
command
resolving
to
make
an
herculean
effort
to
destroy
their
terrible
enemy
the
accounts
are
somewhat
confused
but
according
to
plutarch
crassus
commenced
operations
against
spartacus
before
the
latter
marched
for
sicily
he
sent
one
of
his
lieutenants
mummius
to
follow
and
harass
the
gladiators
but
with
orders
to
avoid
a
general
engagement
the
lieutenant
disobeyed
his
orders
fought
a
battle
and
was
defeated
not
a
few
of
his
men
threw
away
their
arms
and
fled
an
uncommon
thing
with
a
roman
army
the
victors
continued
their
march
but
as
we
have
seen
failed
in
their
main
object
spartacus
then
took
up
a
position
in
the
territory
of
rhegium
which
is
over
against
sicily
he
must
have
been
convinced
by
this
time
that
the
crisis
of
his
fortune
had
arrived
and
though
he
would
not
even
then
entirely
give
up
all
idea
of
crossing
over
into
the
island
that
lay
within
sight
of
his
camp
he
prepared
to
meet
the
coming
storm
which
had
been
for
some
time
gathering
in
his
rear
accordingly
he
faced
about
and
commenced
a
game
of
generalship
with
crassus
who
was
now
in
person
at
the
head
of
the
roman
army
footnote
it
is
probable
that
justice
has
never
been
done
to
crassus
as
a
military
man
roman
writers
were
not
likely
to
deal
fairly
with
a
man
who
closed
his
career
so
fatally
to
himself
and
so
disgracefully
in
every
way
to
his
country
it
was
his
misfortune
a
misfortune
of
his
own
creating
to
lead
the
finest
roman
army
that
had
ever
been
seen
in
the
east
to
destruction
in
an
unjust
attack
on
the
parthians
had
he
succeeded
the
injustice
of
his
course
would
have
been
overlooked
by
his
countrymen
but
they
never
could
forgive
his
defeat
yet
it
is
certain
that
this
man
who
has
come
down
to
us
as
a
contemptible
creature
having
small
claim
to
consideration
beyond
what
he
derived
from
his
enormous
possessions
not
only
exhibited
eminent
military
ability
in
the
war
of
spartacus
but
when
a
young
man
won
that
great
battle
which
takes
its
name
from
the
colline
gate
and
which
laid
the
roman
world
at
the
feet
of
sulla
pontius
telesious
had
marched
upon
rome
with
the
intention
of
destroying
the
den
of
the
wolves
of
italy
and
sulla
arrived
to
the
city
rescue
but
just
in
time
in
the
battle
that
immediately
followed
sulla
at
the
head
of
the
left
wing
of
his
army
was
completely
defeated
while
the
right
wing
commanded
by
crassus
was
as
completely
victorious
talent
must
have
had
something
to
do
with
crassus
success
which
enabled
sulla
to
retrieve
his
fortunes
and
to
triumph
over
the
marius
party
one
hundred
thousand
men
are
said
to
have
fallen
in
this
battle
the
avarice
of
crassus
and
his
want
of
popular
manners
were
fatal
to
him
in
life
and
his
defeat
left
him
no
friends
in
death
of
all
men
then
living
crassus
was
best
entitled
to
command
an
army
employed
in
fighting
revolted
slaves
if
not
the
greatest
slaveholder
in
rome
he
was
the
most
systematic
of
the
class
of
owners
and
knew
best
how
to
turn
the
industry
of
slaves
to
account
he
was
the
wealthiest
citizen
of
the
republic
one
can
understand
how
indignant
such
a
person
must
have
felt
at
the
audacity
of
the
gladiator
and
his
followers
as
a
slaveholder
as
a
man
of
property
as
a
lover
of
law
and
order
he
was
concerned
at
so
very
disorderly
a
spectacle
as
that
of
slaves
subverting
all
the
laws
of
the
republic
as
a
roman
he
felt
that
abhorrence
for
slaves
which
was
common
to
the
character
here
were
motives
enough
to
bring
out
the
powers
of
any
man
if
powers
he
had
in
him
and
it
does
not
follow
that
because
crassus
was
very
rich
he
was
therefore
a
fool
he
was
a
man
of
consummate
talents
and
at
this
particular
time
was
probably
the
most
influential
citizen
of
rome
the
romans
had
confidence
in
him
as
the
embodiment
of
the
spirit
of
supremacy
by
which
they
were
so
completely
animated
the
event
showed
that
their
confidence
was
not
misplaced
the
army
of
crassus
was
two
hundred
thousand
strong
and
having
restored
its
discipline
by
examples
of
great
severity
he
marched
to
meet
spartacus
but
on
arriving
in
front
of
the
latter
position
he
would
not
attack
it
while
spartacus
showed
an
equal
unwillingness
to
fight
the
roman
determined
to
blockade
the
enemy
as
they
had
the
sea
on
one
side
and
that
was
held
by
a
fleet
he
commenced
a
line
of
works
the
completion
of
which
would
have
rendered
it
impossible
for
the
gladiators
to
escape
these
works
were
on
the
usual
roman
scale
and
consisted
principally
of
walls
and
ditches
a
hundred
thousand
men
being
employed
in
their
construction
so
cleverly
did
crassus
conceal
what
he
was
about
that
it
was
not
until
he
had
almost
accomplished
his
design
that
spartacus
discovered
the
intention
of
his
foe
the
emergency
was
suited
to
his
genius
and
he
was
not
unequal
to
it
he
began
a
series
of
attacks
on
the
romans
harassing
them
perpetually
retarding
their
labors
and
drawing
their
attention
from
that
point
of
their
line
by
which
he
purposed
to
extricate
his
army
at
last
on
a
night
when
a
terrible
was
raging
he
led
his
men
to
a
place
where
the
roman
works
were
yet
incomplete
the
snow
enabling
them
to
march
noiselessly
when
they
reached
the
line
the
immense
ditches
seemed
to
bar
their
further
advance
but
they
set
resolutely
at
work
to
fill
them
earth
snow
fagots
and
dead
bodies
of
men
and
beasts
were
hastily
thrown
into
them
and
across
this
singular
bridge
the
whole
army
poured
into
the
country
leaving
the
roman
camp
behind
and
having
rendered
nugatory
all
the
laborious
digging
and
trenching
of
the
legions
it
was
not
until
the
next
morning
that
crassus
discovered
what
had
been
done
and
how
thoroughly
he
had
been
by
spartacus
but
he
had
no
room
for
vexation
in
his
mind
he
was
so
frightened
as
a
roman
citizen
that
he
could
not
feel
mortified
as
a
roman
soldier
he
took
counsel
of
his
fears
and
did
that
which
he
had
cause
both
to
be
ashamed
of
and
to
regret
in
after
days
he
wrote
to
the
senate
stating
that
in
his
opinion
not
only
should
pompeius
be
summoned
home
from
spain
but
lucullus
also
from
the
east
to
aid
in
putting
down
an
enemy
who
was
unconquerable
by
ordinary
means
a
short
time
sufficed
to
show
how
indiscreetly
for
his
own
fame
he
had
acted
for
spartacus
was
unable
to
follow
up
his
success
in
consequence
of
mutinies
in
his
army
the
gauls
again
rebelled
against
his
authority
and
left
him
crassus
concentrated
his
whole
force
in
an
attack
on
the
seceders
and
a
battle
followed
which
plutarch
says
was
the
most
severely
contested
of
the
war
the
romans
remained
masters
of
the
field
more
than
twelve
thousand
of
the
gauls
being
slain
of
whom
only
two
were
wounded
in
the
back
the
rest
falling
in
the
ranks
spartacus
retreated
to
the
mountains
of
petelia
closely
followed
by
roman
detachments
turning
upon
them
he
drove
them
back
but
this
last
gleam
of
success
led
to
his
destruction
his
policy
was
to
avoid
a
battle
but
his
men
would
not
listen
to
his
prudent
counsels
and
compelled
him
to
face
about
and
march
against
crassus
this
was
what
the
roman
desired
for
pompeius
was
bringing
up
an
army
from
spain
and
would
be
sure
to
reap
all
the
honors
of
the
war
were
it
to
be
prolonged
some
accounts
represent
spartacus
as
anxious
for
battle
whether
he
was
so
or
not
he
made
every
preparation
that
became
a
good
general
the
armies
met
on
the
silarus
in
the
northern
part
of
lucania
and
the
battle
which
followed
and
which
was
to
finish
this
remarkable
war
was
fought
not
far
from
where
the
traveller
now
sees
the
noble
ruins
of
paestum
spartacus
made
his
last
speech
to
his
soldiers
warning
them
of
what
they
would
have
to
expect
if
they
should
fall
alive
into
the
hands
of
their
old
masters
by
way
of
practical
commentary
on
his
text
he
caused
a
cross
to
be
erected
on
a
height
and
to
that
cross
was
nailed
a
living
roman
whose
agonies
were
visible
to
the
whole
army
spartacus
then
ordered
his
horse
to
be
brought
to
him
in
front
of
the
army
and
slew
the
animal
with
his
own
hands
i
am
determined
he
said
to
his
men
to
share
all
your
dangers
our
positions
shall
be
the
same
if
we
are
victorious
i
shall
get
horses
enough
from
the
foe
if
we
are
beaten
i
shall
need
a
horse
no

footnote
when
the
earl
of
warwick
the
killed
his
horse
in
front
of
the
yorkist
army
at
the
battle
of
towton
fought
on
palm
sunday
he
little
knew
that
he
was
imitating
the
action
of
a
general
of
revolted
slaves
more
than
fifteen
centuries
earlier
warwick
is
said
to
have
done
the
same
thing
at
the
battle
of
barnet
the
last
of
his
fields
where
he
was
defeated
and
slain
fighting
for
the
house
of
lancaster
the
battle
that
followed
was
the
most
severely
contested
action
of
that
warlike
period
which
extending
through
two
generations
saw
the
victories
of
marius
over
the
northern
barbarians
at
its
commencement
and
pharsalia
and
munda
and
philippi
at
its
close
the
insurgents
attacked
with
great
fury
but
with
method
spartacus
leading
the
way
at
the
head
of
a
band
of
select
followers
thus
acting
the
part
of
a
soldier
as
well
as
of
a
general
the
romans
steadily
resisted
and
the
slaughter
was
great
on
both
sides
at
last
victory
began
to
incline
towards
the
gladiators
when
spartacus
fell
and
the
fortune
of
the
day
was
changed
he
had
made
a
fierce
charge
on
the
romans
with
the
intention
of
cutting
his
way
to
crassus
two
centurions
had
fallen
by
his
sword
and
a
number
of
inferior
men
when
he
was
himself
wounded
in
one
of
his
thighs
falling
upon
one
knee
he
still
continued
to
fight
until
he
was
overpowered
and
slain
the
battle
was
maintained
for
some
time
longer
and
ended
only
with
the
destruction
of
the
insurgents
thirty
thousand
of
whom
were
killed
livy
puts
their
killed
at
forty
thousand
the
roman
slain
numbered
twenty
thousand
and
they
had
as
many
more
wounded
only
six
thousand
prisoners
fell
into
the
hands
of
crassus
who
caused
the
whole
of
them
to
be
crucified
the
crosses
being
placed
at
intervals
on
both
sides
of
the
appian
way
between
capua
and
rome
and
the
whole
roman
army
being
marched
through
the
horrible
lines
a
body
of
five
thousand
fugitives
who
sought
refuge
in
the
north
were
intercepted
by
pompeius
on
his
homeward
march
from
spain
and
slaughtered
to
a
man
thus
fell
spartacus
and
far
more
nobly
than
either
of
the
great
republican
chiefs
whose
deaths
were
so
soon
to
follow
pompeius
who
boasted
that
he
had
cut
up
the
war
by
the
roots
ran
away
from
pharsalia
without
an
effort
to
retrieve
his
fortunes
though
the
force
opposed
to
him
in
the
battle
was
only
half
as
large
as
his
own
and
he
had
still
abundant
resources
for
future
operations
crassus
who
claimed
to
have
conquered
spartacus
and
who
not
unreasonably
resented
the
pretensions
of
pompeius
fell
miserably
in
parthia
after
having
led
the
romans
to
the
most
fatal
of
their
fields
except
cannae
wanting
the
nerve
to
die
sword
in
hand
in
the
midst
of
his
foes
like
spartacus
he
consented
to
adorn
the
triumph
of
those
foes
and
perished
as
ignominiously
as
the
great
gladiator
gloriously
who
paid
for
the
prima
donna
i
if
anything
could
make
a
man
forgive
himself
for
being
sixty
years
old
said
the
consul
holding
up
his
between
his
eye
and
the
setting
sun
for
it
was
it
would
be
that
he
can
remember
in
her
divine
sixteenity
at
the
park
theatre
thirty
odd
years
ago
egad
sir
one
could
help
making
great
allowances
for
after
seeing
her
in
she
was
beyond
imagination
and
delicious
the
consul
as
my
readers
may
have
partly
inferred
was
not
a
roman
consul
nor
yet
a
french
one
he
had
had
the
honor
of
representing
this
great
republic
at
one
of
the
hanse
towns
i
forget
which
in
president
monroe
time
i
do
recollect
how
long
he
held
the
office
but
it
was
long
enough
to
make
the
title
stick
to
him
for
the
rest
of
his
life
with
the
tenacity
of
a
militia
colonelcy
or
village
diaconate
the
country
people
round
about
used
to
call
him
the
which
i
believe
for
i
am
not
very
fresh
from
my
was
etymologically
correct
enough
however
orthoepically
erroneous
he
had
not
limited
his
european
life
however
within
the
precinct
of
his
hanseatic
consulship
but
had
dispersed
himself
very
promiscuously
over
the
continent
and
had
seen
many
cities
and
the
manners
of
many
men
and
of
some
women
i
mean
in
their
public
character
for
the
consul
correct
of
life
as
of
ear
never
sought
to
undeify
his
divinities
by
pursuing
them
from
the
heaven
of
the
stage
to
the
purgatorial
intermediacy
of
the
still
less
to
the
lower
depth
of
disenchantment
into
which
too
many
of
them
sunk
in
their
private
life
yes
sir
he
went
on
i
have
seen
and
heard
them
all
catalani
pasta
pezzaroni
grisi
and
all
the
rest
of
them
even
sonntag
though
not
in
her
very
best
estate
but
i
give
you
my
word
there
is
none
that
has
taken
lodgings
here
tapping
his
forehead
so
permanently
as
the
signorina
g
or
that
i
can
see
and
hear
so
distinctly
when
i
am
in
the
mood
of
it
by
myself
desdemona
and
as
i
said
just
now
she
is
as
fresh
in
them
all
to
my
mind
eye
and
ear
as
if
the
park
theatre
had
not
given
way
to
a
cursed
and
i
had
been
hearing
her
there
only
last
night
let
drink
her
memory
the
consul
added
half
in
mirth
and
half
in
melancholy
a
mood
to
which
he
was
not
unused
and
which
did
not
ill
become
him
now
no
intelligent
person
who
knew
the
excellence
of
the
wine
could
refuse
to
pay
this
posthumous
honor
to
the
harmonious
shade
of
the
lost
muse
the
consul
was
an
man
in
his
tastes
to
be
sure
and
held
to
the
old
religion
of
madeira
which
divided
the
faith
of
our
fathers
with
the
cambridge
platform
and
had
never
given
in
to
the
later
heresies
which
have
crept
into
the
communion
of
from
the
south
of
france
and
the
rhine
a
glass
of
champagne
he
would
say
is
all
well
enough
at
the
end
of
dinner
just
to
take
the
grease
out
of
one
throat
and
get
the
palate
ready
for
the
more
serious
vintages
ordained
for
the
solemn
and
deliberate
drinking
by
which
man
justifies
his
creation
but
madeira
sir
madeira
is
the
only
that
never
fails
a
man
and
can
always
be
depended
upon
as
something
sure
and
steadfast
i
confess
to
having
fallen
away
myself
from
the
gracious
doctrine
and
works
to
which
he
had
held
so
fast
but
i
am
no
bigot
which
for
a
heretic
is
something
remarkable
and
had
no
scruple
about
uniting
with
him
in
the
service
he
proposed
without
demur
or
protestation
as
to
form
or
substance
indeed
he
disarmed
fanaticism
by
the
curious
care
he
bestowed
on
making
his
works
conformable
to
the
faith
that
was
in
him
for
partly
by
inheritance
and
partly
by
industrious
pains
his
old
house
was
undermined
by
a
cellar
of
wine
such
as
is
seldom
seen
in
these
days
of
modern
degeneracy
he
is
the
last
gentleman
that
i
know
of
of
that
old
school
that
used
to
import
their
own
wine
and
lay
it
down
annually
themselves
their
bins
forming
a
kind
of
vinous
calendar
suggestive
of
great
events
their
degenerate
sons
are
content
to
be
furnished
as
they
want
it
from
the
dubious
stores
of
the
vintner
by
retail
i
suppose
it
was
her
youth
and
beauty
sir
i
suggested
that
made
her
so
rememberable
to
you
you
know
she
was
barely
turned
seventeen
when
she
sung
in
this
country
partly
that
no
doubt
replied
the
consul
but
not
altogether
nor
chiefly
no
sir
it
was
her
genius
which
made
her
beauty
so
glorious
she
was
wonderfully
handsome
though
she
was
a
phantom
of
delight
as
that
lake
fellow
says
it
was
thus
profanely
that
the
consul
designated
the
poet
wordsworth
whom
he
could
not
abide
and
the
best
thing
he
ever
said
by
jove
and
did
you
never
see
her
again
i
inquired
once
only
he
answered
eight
or
nine
years
afterwards
a
year
or
two
before
she
died
it
was
at
venice
and
in
she
was
different
and
yet
not
changed
for
the
worse
there
was
an
indescribable
look
of
sadness
out
of
her
eyes
that
touched
one
oddly
and
fixed
itself
in
the
memory
but
she
was
something
apart
and
by
herself
and
stamped
herself
on
one
mind
as
rachel
did
in
or
it
was
true
genius
and
no
imitation
that
made
both
of
them
what
they
were
but
she
actually
had
the
physical
beauty
which
rachel
only
compelled
you
to
think
she
had
by
the
force
of
her
genius
and
consummate
dramatic
skill
while
she
was
on
the
scene
before
you
but
do
you
rank
with
rachel
as
a
dramatic
artist
i
asked
i
can
not
tell
he
answered
but
if
she
had
not
the
studied
perfection
of
rachel
which
was
always
the
same
and
could
not
be
altered
without
harm
she
had
at
least
a
capacity
of
impulsive
about
her
which
made
her
for
the
time
the
character
she
personated
not
always
the
same
but
such
as
the
woman
she
represented
might
have
been
in
the
shifting
phases
of
the
passion
that
possessed
her
and
to
think
that
she
died
at
what
might
not
ten
years
more
have
made
her
it
is
odd
i
observed
that
her
fame
should
be
forever
connected
with
the
name
she
got
by
her
first
unlucky
marriage
in
new
york
for
it
was
unlucky
enough
i
believe
was
it
not
you
may
say
that
responded
the
consul
without
fear
of
denial
or
qualification
it
was
disgraceful
in
its
beginning
and
in
its
ending
it
was
a
swindle
on
a
large
scale
and
poor
maria
g
was
the
one
who
suffered
the
most
by
the
operation
i
have
always
heard
said
i
that
old
g
was
cheated
out
of
the
price
for
which
he
had
sold
his
daughter
and
that
got
his
wife
on
false
pretences
not
altogether
so
returned
the
consul
i
happen
to
know
all
about
that
matter
from
the
best
authority
she
was
obtained
on
false
pretences
to
be
sure
but
it
was
not
g
that
suffered
by
them
moreover
never
paid
the
price
agreed
upon
and
yet
g
got
it
for
all
that
indeed
i
exclaimed
it
must
have
been
a
neat
operation
i
can
not
exactly
see
how
the
thing
was
done
but
i
have
no
doubt
a
tale
hangs
thereby
and
a
good
one
is
it
tellable
i
see
no
reason
why
not
said
the
consul
the
sufferer
made
no
secret
of
it
and
i
know
of
no
reason
why
i
should
mynheer
van
holland
told
me
the
story
himself
in
amsterdam
in
the
year
and
who
was
he
i
inquired
and
what
had
he
to
do
with
it
i
tell
you
responded
the
consul
filling
his
glass
and
passing
the
bottle
if
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
shut
the
window
behind
you
and
ring
for
candles
for
it
gets
chilly
here
among
the
mountains
as
soon
as
the
sun
is
down
i
beg
your
pardon
did
you
make
a
remark
oh
you
must
really
pardon
me
i
can
not
give
you
such
a
clue
as
that
to
the
identity
of
my
dear
consul
just
now
for
excellent
and
sufficient
reasons
but
if
you
have
paid
your
money
for
the
sight
of
this
number
you
may
take
your
choice
of
all
the
mountain
ranges
on
the
continent
from
the
rocky
to
the
white
and
settle
him
just
where
you
like
only
you
must
leave
a
gap
to
the
westward
through
which
the
river
also
anonymous
for
the
present
distress
breaks
its
way
and
which
gives
him
half
an
hour
more
sunshine
than
he
would
otherwise
be
entitled
to
and
slope
the
fields
down
to
its
margin
near
a
mile
off
with
their
native
timber
thinned
so
skilfully
as
to
have
the
effect
of
the
best
it
is
a
grand
and
lovely
scene
and
when
i
look
at
it
i
do
not
wonder
at
one
of
the
consul
apophthegms
namely
that
the
chief
advantage
of
foreign
travel
is
that
it
teaches
you
that
one
place
is
just
as
good
to
live
in
as
another
imagine
that
the
one
place
he
had
in
his
mind
at
the
time
was
just
this
one
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
when
candles
came
we
drew
our
chairs
together
and
he
told
me
in
substance
the
following
story
i
will
tell
it
in
my
own
words
not
that
they
are
so
good
as
his
but
because
they
come
more
readily
to
the
nib
of
my
pen
ii
new
york
has
grown
considerably
since
she
was
new
amsterdam
and
has
almost
forgotten
her
whilom
dependence
on
her
first
godmother
indeed
had
it
not
been
for
the
historic
industry
of
the
erudite
diedrich
knickerbocker
very
few
of
her
sons
would
know
much
about
the
obligations
of
their
nursing
mother
to
their
old
grandame
beyond
sea
in
the
days
of
the
dutch
dynasty
still
though
the
old
monopoly
has
been
dead
these
two
hundred
years
or
thereabout
there
is
i
know
not
how
many
fold
more
traffic
with
her
than
in
the
days
when
it
was
in
full
life
and
force
doth
not
that
benefactor
of
his
species
udolpho
wolfe
derive
thence
his
immortal
or
immortalizing
schiedam
schnapps
the
virtues
whereof
according
to
his
advertisements
are
fast
transferring
from
the
domain
of
pleasure
to
that
of
positive
duty
too
and
toys
such
as
the
friendly
saint
whom
protestant
children
have
been
taught
by
dutch
tradition
to
invoke
delights
to
drop
into
the
votive
stocking
they
come
from
the
mother
city
where
she
sits
upon
the
waters
quite
as
much
a
as
venice
herself
and
linens
too
fair
and
fresh
and
pure
as
the
maidens
that
weave
them
come
forth
from
dutch
looms
ready
to
grace
our
tables
or
to
deck
our
beds
and
the
mention
of
these
brings
me
back
to
my
story
though
the
immediate
connection
between
holland
linen
and
marriage
may
not
at
first
view
be
palpable
to
sight
still
it
is
a
fact
that
the
web
of
this
part
of
her
variegated
destiny
was
spun
and
woven
out
of
threads
of
flax
that
took
the
substantial
shape
of
fine
hollands
and
this
is
the
way
in
which
it
came
to
pass
mynheer
van
holland
of
whom
the
consul
spoke
just
now
you
must
understand
to
have
been
one
of
the
chief
merchants
of
amsterdam
a
city
whose
merchants
are
princes
and
have
been
kings
his
transactions
extended
to
all
parts
of
the
old
world
and
did
not
skip
over
the
new
his
ships
visited
the
harbor
of
new
york
as
well
as
of
london
and
as
he
died
two
or
three
years
ago
a
very
rich
man
his
adventures
in
general
must
have
been
more
remunerative
than
the
one
i
am
going
to
relate
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
it
seemed
good
to
this
worthy
merchant
to
despatch
a
vessel
with
a
cargo
chiefly
made
up
of
linens
to
the
market
of
new
york
the
honest
man
little
dreamed
with
what
a
fate
his
ship
was
fraught
wrapped
up
in
those
flaxen
folds
he
happened
to
be
in
london
the
winter
before
and
was
present
at
the
of
maria
g
at
the
king
theatre
he
must
have
admired
the
beauty
grace
and
promise
of
the
youthful
had
he
been
ten
times
a
dutchman
and
if
he
heard
of
her
intended
emigration
to
america
as
he
possibly
might
have
done
it
most
likely
excited
no
particular
emotion
in
his
phlegmatic
bosom
he
could
not
have
imagined
that
the
exportation
of
a
little
to
new
york
should
interfere
with
a
potential
venture
of
his
own
in
fair
linen
the
gods
kindly
hid
the
future
from
his
eyes
so
that
he
might
enjoy
the
comic
vexation
her
lively
sallies
caused
to
in
the
play
unknowing
that
she
would
be
the
innocent
cause
of
a
more
serious
provocation
to
himself
in
downright
earnest
he
thought
of
this
himself
after
it
had
all
happened
well
the
good
ship
had
prosperous
gales
and
fair
weather
across
the
ocean
and
dropped
anchor
off
the
battery
with
some
days
to
spare
from
the
amount
due
to
the
voyage
the
consignee
came
off
and
took
possession
of
the
cargo
and
duly
transferred
it
to
his
own
warehouse
though
the
advantages
of
advertising
were
not
as
fully
understood
in
those
days
of
comparative
ignorance
as
they
have
been
since
he
duly
announced
the
goods
which
he
had
received
and
waited
for
a
customer
he
did
not
have
to
wait
long
it
was
but
a
day
or
two
after
the
appearance
of
the
advertisement
in
the
newspapers
that
he
had
prime
holland
linens
on
hand
just
received
from
amsterdam
when
he
was
waited
upon
by
a
gentleman
of
good
address
and
evidently
of
french
extraction
who
inquired
of
the
consignee
whom
we
will
call
schulemberg
for
the
nonce
whether
he
had
the
linens
he
had
advertised
yet
on
hand
they
are
still
on
hand
and
on
sale
said
schulemberg
what
is
the
price
of
the
entire
consignment
inquired
the
customer
fifty
thousand
dollars
responded
schulemberg
and
the
terms
cash
on
delivery
very
good
replied
the
obliging
buyer
if
they
be
of
the
quality
you
describe
in
your
advertisement
i
will
take
them
on
those
terms
send
them
down
to
my
warehouse
no
pearl
street
tomorrow
morning
and
i
will
send
you
the
money
and
your
name
inquired
schulemberg
is
responded
the
courteous
purchaser
the
two
merchants
bowed
politely
the
one
to
the
other
mutually
well
pleased
with
the
morning
work
and
bade
each
other
good
day
schulemberg
knew
but
little
if
anything
about
his
new
customer
but
as
the
transaction
was
to
be
a
cash
one
he
did
not
mind
that
he
calculated
his
commissions
gave
orders
to
his
head
clerk
to
see
the
goods
duly
delivered
the
next
morning
and
went
on
change
and
thence
to
dinner
in
the
enjoyment
of
a
complacent
mind
and
a
good
appetite
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
did
the
same
at
any
rate
he
had
the
most
reason
at
least
according
to
his
probable
notions
of
mercantile
morality
and
success
iii
the
next
day
came
and
with
it
came
betimes
the
packages
of
linens
to
warehouse
in
pearl
street
but
the
price
for
the
same
did
not
come
as
punctually
to
schulemberg
according
to
the
contract
under
which
they
were
delivered
in
point
of
fact
was
not
in
at
the
time
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
would
attend
to
the
matter
without
delay
as
soon
as
he
came
in
a
cash
transaction
does
not
necessarily
imply
so
much
the
instant
presence
of
coin
as
the
unequivocal
absence
of
credit
a
day
or
two
more
or
less
is
of
no
material
consequence
only
there
is
to
be
no
delay
for
sales
and
returns
before
payment
so
schulemberg
gave
himself
no
uneasiness
about
the
matter
when
two
three
and
even
five
and
six
days
had
slid
away
without
producing
the
apparition
of
the
current
money
of
the
merchant
a
man
who
transacted
affairs
on
so
large
a
scale
as
and
conducted
them
on
the
sound
basis
of
ready
money
might
safely
be
trusted
for
so
short
a
time
but
when
a
week
had
elapsed
and
no
tidings
had
been
received
either
of
purchaser
or
schulemberg
thought
it
time
for
himself
to
interfere
in
his
own
proper
person
accordingly
he
incontinently
proceeded
to
the
of
to
receive
the
promised
price
or
to
know
the
reason
why
if
he
failed
to
obtain
the
one
satisfaction
he
at
least
could
not
complain
of
being
disappointed
of
the
other
matters
seemed
to
be
in
some
little
confusion
and
the
clerks
in
a
high
state
of
gleeful
excitement
addressing
himself
to
the
chief
among
them
schulemberg
asked
the
pertinent
question
is
in
no
sir
was
the
answer
he
is
not
and
he
will
not
be
just
at
present
but
when
will
he
be
in
for
i
must
see
him
on
some
pressing
business
of
importance
not
sir
replied
the
clerk
smiling
expressively
he
can
not
be
interrupted
on
any
business
of
any
kind
whatever
the
deuce
he
ca
returned
schulemberg
i
see
about
that
very
soon
i
can
tell
you
he
promised
to
pay
me
cash
for
fifty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
holland
linens
a
week
ago
i
have
not
seen
the
color
of
his
money
yet
and
i
mean
to
wait
no
longer
where
does
he
live
for
if
he
be
alive
i
will
see
him
and
hear
what
he
has
to
say
for
himself
and
that
speedily
indeed
sir
pleasantly
expostulated
the
clerk
i
think
when
you
understand
the
circumstances
of
the
case
you
will
forbear
disturbing
this
day
of
all
others
in
his
life
why
what
the
devil
ails
this
day
above
all
others
said
schulemberg
somewhat
testily
that
he
ca
see
his
creditors
and
pay
his
debts
on
it
why
sir
the
fact
is
the
clerk
replied
with
an
air
of
interest
and
importance
it
is
he
marries
this
morning
the
signorina
g
and
i
am
sure
you
would
not
molest
him
with
business
on
such
an
occasion
as
that
but
my
fifty
thousand
dollars
persisted
the
consignee
and
why
have
they
not
been
paid
oh
give
yourself
no
uneasiness
at
all
about
that
sir
replied
the
clerk
with
the
air
of
one
to
whom
the
handling
of
such
trifles
was
a
daily
occurrence
will
of
course
attend
to
that
matter
the
moment
he
is
a
little
at
leisure
in
fact
i
imagine
that
in
the
hurry
and
bustle
inseparable
from
an
event
of
this
nature
the
circumstance
has
entirely
escaped
his
mind
but
as
soon
as
he
returns
to
business
again
i
will
recall
it
to
his
recollection
and
you
will
hear
from
him
without
delay
the
clerk
was
right
in
his
augury
as
to
the
effect
his
intelligence
would
have
upon
the
creditor
it
was
not
a
clerical
error
on
his
part
when
he
supposed
that
schulemberg
would
not
choose
to
enact
the
part
of
skeleton
at
the
wedding
breakfast
of
the
young
there
is
something
about
the
great
events
of
life
which
can
not
happen
a
great
many
times
to
anybody
a
wedding
or
a
funeral
a
mourning
or
a
festival
that
touches
the
strings
of
the
one
human
heart
of
us
all
and
makes
it
return
no
uncertain
sound
himself
would
hardly
have
demanded
his
pound
of
flesh
on
the
had
it
been
that
was
to
espouse
the
fair
even
he
would
have
allowed
three
days
of
grace
before
demanding
the
specific
performance
of
his
bond
now
schulemberg
was
very
far
from
being
a
shylock
and
he
was
also
a
constant
attendant
upon
the
opera
and
a
devoted
admirer
of
the
lovely
g
so
he
could
not
wonder
that
a
man
on
the
eve
of
marriage
with
that
divine
creature
should
forget
every
other
consideration
in
the
immediate
contemplation
of
his
happiness
even
if
it
were
the
consideration
for
a
cargo
of
prime
linens
and
one
to
the
tune
of
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
it
is
altogether
likely
that
the
mundane
reflection
occurred
to
him
and
made
him
easier
in
his
mind
under
the
delay
that
old
g
was
by
no
means
the
kind
of
man
to
give
away
a
daughter
who
dropped
gold
and
silver
from
her
sweet
lips
whenever
she
opened
them
in
public
as
the
princess
in
the
did
pearls
and
diamonds
to
any
man
who
could
not
give
him
a
solid
equivalent
in
return
so
that
in
fact
he
regarded
the
notes
of
the
signorina
g
as
so
much
collateral
security
for
his
debt
so
schulemberg
was
content
to
bide
his
reasonable
time
for
the
discharge
of
indebtedness
to
his
principal
he
had
advised
mynheer
van
holland
of
the
speedy
sale
of
his
consignment
and
given
him
hopes
of
a
quick
return
of
the
proceeds
but
as
days
wore
away
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
time
he
was
called
on
to
bide
was
growing
into
an
unreasonable
one
i
can
not
state
with
precision
exactly
how
long
he
waited
whether
he
disturbed
the
sweet
influences
of
the
by
his
intrusive
presence
or
permitted
that
nectareous
satellite
to
fill
her
horns
and
wax
and
wane
in
peace
before
he
sought
to
bring
the
bridegroom
down
to
the
things
of
earth
are
questions
which
i
must
leave
to
the
discretion
of
my
readers
to
settle
each
for
himself
or
herself
according
to
their
own
notions
of
the
proprieties
of
the
case
but
at
the
proper
time
after
patience
had
thrown
up
in
disgust
the
office
of
a
virtue
he
took
his
hat
and
cane
one
fine
morning
and
walked
down
to
no
pearl
street
for
the
double
purpose
of
wishing
joy
of
his
marriage
and
of
receiving
the
price
promised
long
and
long
withheld
of
the
linens
which
form
the
tissue
of
my
story
the
gods
gave
ear
and
granted
half
his
prayer
the
rest
the
winds
dispersed
in
empty
air
there
was
not
the
slightest
difficulty
about
his
imparting
his
epithalamic
congratulation
but
as
to
his
receiving
the
numismatic
consideration
for
which
he
hoped
in
return
that
was
an
entirely
different
affair
he
found
matters
in
the
again
apparently
something
out
of
joint
but
with
a
less
smiling
and
sunny
atmosphere
pervading
them
than
he
had
remarked
on
his
last
visit
he
was
received
by
with
courtesy
a
little
perhaps
and
not
as
flowing
and
gracious
as
at
their
first
interview
preliminaries
over
schulemberg
plunging
with
epic
energy
into
the
midst
of
things
said
i
have
called
to
receive
the
fifty
thousand
dollars
which
you
will
remember
you
engaged
to
pay
down
for
the
linens
i
sold
you
on
such
a
day
i
can
make
allowance
for
the
interruption
which
has
prevented
your
attending
to
this
business
sooner
but
it
is
now
high
time
that
it
were
settled
i
consent
to
it
all
monsieur
replied
with
a
deprecatory
gesture
you
have
reason
and
i
am
desolated
that
it
is
the
impossible
that
you
ask
of
me
to
do
how
sir
demanded
the
creditor
what
do
you
mean
by
the
impossible
you
do
not
mean
to
deny
that
you
agreed
to
pay
cash
for
the
goods
my
faith
no
monsieur
shruggingly
responded
i
avow
it
you
have
reason
i
promised
to
pay
the
money
as
you
say
it
but
if
i
have
not
the
money
to
pay
you
how
can
i
pay
you
the
money
what
to
do
i
do
understand
you
sir
returned
schulemberg
you
have
not
the
money
and
you
do
not
mean
to
pay
me
according
to
agreement
but
monsieur
how
can
i
when
i
have
not
money
have
you
not
heard
that
i
have
made
what
you
call
it
failure
yesterday
i
am
grieved
of
it
thrice
sensibly
but
if
it
went
of
my
life
i
could
not
pay
you
for
your
fine
linens
which
were
of
a
good
market
at
the
price
indeed
sir
replied
schulemberg
i
had
not
heard
of
your
misfortunes
and
i
am
heartily
sorry
for
them
on
my
own
account
and
yours
but
still
more
on
account
of
your
charming
wife
but
there
is
no
great
harm
done
after
all
send
the
linens
back
to
me
and
accounts
shall
be
square
between
us
and
i
will
submit
to
the
loss
of
the
interest
ah
but
monsieur
you
are
too
good
and
madame
will
be
recognizant
to
you
forever
for
your
gracious
politeness
but
my
god
it
is
impossible
that
i
return
to
you
the
linen
i
have
sold
it
monsieur
i
have
sold
it
all
sold
it
reiterated
schulemberg
regardless
of
the
rules
of
etiquette
sold
it
and
to
whom
pray
and
when
to
g
my
answered
the
catechumen
blandly
and
it
is
a
week
that
he
has
received
it
then
i
must
bid
you
a
good
morning
sir
said
schulemberg
rising
hastily
and
collecting
his
hat
and
gloves
for
i
must
lose
no
time
in
taking
measures
to
recover
the
goods
before
they
have
changed
hands
again
pardon
monsieur
interrupted
the
poor
but
honest
but
it
is
too
late
one
can
not
regain
them
g
embarked
himself
for
mexico
yesterday
morning
and
carried
them
all
with
him
imagine
the
consternation
and
rage
of
poor
schulemberg
at
finding
that
he
was
sold
though
the
goods
were
not
i
decline
reporting
the
conversation
any
farther
lest
its
strength
of
expression
and
force
of
expletive
might
be
too
much
for
the
more
queasy
of
my
readers
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
royalty
of
coining
a
word
at
once
freed
his
own
mind
and
imprisoned
the
body
of
for
in
those
days
imprisonment
for
debt
was
a
recognized
institution
and
i
think
few
of
its
strongest
opponents
will
deny
that
this
was
a
case
to
which
it
was
no
abuse
to
apply
it
iv
i
regret
that
i
am
compelled
to
leave
this
exemplary
merchant
in
captivity
but
the
exigencies
of
my
story
the
moral
of
which
beckons
me
away
to
the
distant
coast
of
mexico
require
it
at
my
hands
the
reader
may
be
consoled
however
by
the
knowledge
that
he
obtained
his
liberation
in
due
time
his
dutch
creditor
being
entirely
satisfied
that
nothing
whatsoever
could
be
squeezed
out
of
him
by
passing
him
between
the
bars
of
the
debtor
prison
though
that
was
all
the
satisfaction
he
ever
did
get
how
he
accompanied
his
young
wife
to
europe
and
there
lived
by
the
coining
of
her
voice
into
drachmas
as
her
father
had
done
before
him
needs
not
to
be
told
here
nor
yet
how
she
was
divorced
from
him
and
made
another
matrimonial
venture
in
partnership
with
de
b
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
or
her
after
the
bargain
and
sale
of
which
she
was
the
object
and
the
consequences
which
immediately
resulted
from
it
and
here
accordingly
i
take
my
leave
of
them
but
my
story
is
not
quite
done
yet
it
must
now
pursue
the
fortunes
of
the
enterprising
signor
g
who
had
so
deftly
turned
his
daughter
into
a
of
fine
linens
this
excellent
person
sailed
as
told
schulemberg
for
vera
cruz
with
an
assorted
cargo
consisting
of
singers
fiddlers
and
as
aforesaid
of
mynheer
van
holland
fine
linens
the
voyage
was
as
prosperous
as
was
due
to
such
an
argosy
if
a
single
amphion
could
not
be
drowned
by
the
utmost
malice
of
gods
and
men
so
long
as
he
kept
his
voice
in
order
what
possible
mishap
could
befall
a
whole
of
them
the
vessel
arrived
safely
under
the
shadow
of
san
juan
de
ulua
and
her
precious
freight
in
all
its
varieties
was
welcomed
with
a
tropical
enthusiasm
the
market
was
bare
of
linen
and
of
song
and
it
was
hard
to
say
which
found
the
readiest
sale
competition
raised
the
price
of
both
articles
to
a
fabulous
height
so
the
good
g
had
the
benevolent
satisfaction
of
clothing
the
naked
and
making
the
ears
that
heard
him
to
bless
him
at
the
same
time
after
selling
his
linens
at
a
great
advance
on
the
cost
price
considering
he
had
only
paid
his
daughter
for
them
and
having
given
a
series
of
the
most
successful
concerts
ever
known
in
those
latitudes
signor
g
set
forth
for
the
aztec
city
as
the
relations
of
and
were
not
upon
the
most
satisfactory
footing
just
then
at
vera
cruz
he
thought
it
most
prudent
to
carry
his
treasure
with
him
to
the
capital
his
progress
thither
was
a
triumphal
procession
not
cortés
not
general
scott
himself
marched
more
gloriously
along
the
steep
and
rugged
road
that
leads
from
the
to
the
than
did
this
son
of
song
every
city
on
his
line
of
march
was
the
monument
of
a
victory
and
from
each
one
he
levied
tribute
and
bore
spoils
away
and
the
vanquished
thanked
him
for
this
spoiling
of
their
goods
arrived
at
the
splendid
city
at
that
time
the
largest
and
most
populous
on
the
north
american
continent
he
speedily
made
himself
master
of
it
a
welcome
conqueror
the
mexicans
with
the
genuine
love
for
song
of
their
southern
ancestors
had
had
but
few
opportunities
for
gratifying
it
such
as
that
now
offered
to
them
g
was
a
tenor
of
great
compass
and
a
most
skilful
and
accomplished
singer
the
artists
who
accompanied
him
were
of
a
high
order
of
merit
if
not
of
the
very
first
class
mexico
had
never
heard
the
like
and
though
a
country
was
glad
to
take
their
notes
and
give
them
gold
in
return
they
were
feasted
and
flattered
in
the
intervals
of
the
concerts
and
the
bright
eyes
of
señoras
and
señoritas
rained
influence
upon
them
on
the
off
nights
as
their
fair
hands
rained
flowers
upon
the
ones
and
they
have
a
very
pleasant
way
in
those
golden
realms
of
giving
ornaments
of
diamonds
and
other
precious
stones
to
virtuous
singers
as
we
give
and
gold
watches
to
meritorious
railway
conductors
and
hotel
clerks
as
a
testimonial
of
the
sense
we
entertain
of
their
private
characters
and
public
services
the
gorgeous
east
herself
never
showered
on
her
kings
barbaric
pearl
and
gold
with
a
richer
hand
than
the
city
of
mexico
poured
out
the
glittering
rain
over
the
portly
person
of
the
happy
g
saturated
at
length
with
the
golden
flood
and
its
foam
of
pearl
and
diamond
if
indeed
singer
were
ever
capable
of
such
saturation
and
were
not
rather
permeable
forever
like
a
sieve
of
the
danaides
saturated
or
satisfied
that
it
was
all
run
out
he
prepared
to
take
up
his
line
of
march
back
again
to
the
city
of
the
true
cross
mexico
mourned
over
his
going
and
sent
him
forth
upon
his
way
with
blessings
and
prayers
for
his
safe
return
but
alas
the
blessings
and
the
prayers
were
alike
vain
the
saints
were
either
deaf
or
busy
or
had
gone
a
journey
and
either
did
not
hear
or
did
not
mind
the
vows
that
were
sent
up
to
them
at
any
rate
they
did
not
take
that
care
of
the
worthy
g
which
their
devotees
had
a
right
to
expect
of
them
turning
his
back
on
the
halls
of
the
montezumas
where
he
had
revelled
so
sumptuously
he
proceeded
on
his
way
towards
the
atlantic
coast
as
fast
as
his
mules
thought
fit
to
carry
him
and
his
beloved
treasure
with
the
proceeds
of
his
linens
and
his
lungs
he
was
rich
enough
to
retire
from
the
vicissitudes
of
operatic
life
to
some
safe
retreat
in
his
native
spain
or
his
adoptive
italy
filled
with
happy
imaginings
he
fared
onward
the
bells
of
his
mules
keeping
time
with
the
melodious
joy
of
his
heart
until
he
had
descended
from
the
to
the
wilder
region
on
the
hither
side
of
jalapa
as
the
narrow
road
turned
sharply
at
the
foot
of
a
steeper
descent
than
common
into
a
dreary
valley
made
yet
more
gloomy
by
the
shadow
of
the
hill
behind
intercepting
the
sun
though
the
afternoon
was
not
far
advanced
the
was
made
unpleasantly
aware
of
the
transitory
nature
of
man
hopes
and
the
vanity
of
his
joys
when
his
train
wound
into
the
rough
open
space
it
found
itself
surrounded
by
a
troop
of
men
whose
looks
and
gestures
bespoke
their
function
without
the
intermediation
of
an
interpreter
but
no
interpreter
was
needed
in
this
case
as
signor
g
was
a
spaniard
by
birth
and
their
expressive
pantomime
was
a
sufficiently
eloquent
substitute
for
speech
in
plain
english
he
had
fallen
among
thieves
with
very
little
chance
of
any
good
samaritan
coming
by
to
help
him
now
signor
g
had
had
dealings
with
brigands
and
banditti
all
his
operatic
life
indeed
he
had
often
drilled
them
till
they
were
perfect
in
their
exercises
and
got
them
up
regardless
of
expense
under
his
direction
they
had
often
rushed
forward
to
the
footlights
pouring
into
the
helpless
mass
before
them
repeated
volleys
of
explosive
crotchets
but
this
was
a
very
different
chorus
that
now
saluted
his
eyes
it
was
the
real
thing
instead
of
the
and
in
the
opinion
of
signor
g
at
least
very
much
inferior
to
it
instead
of
the
hat
jauntily
feathered
and
looped
these
irregulars
wore
huge
much
the
worse
for
time
and
weather
flapped
over
their
faces
for
the
velvet
jacket
with
the
tail
which
had
nearly
broken
up
the
friendship
between
pickwick
and
tupman
when
the
latter
gentleman
proposed
induing
himself
with
one
on
the
occasion
of
leo
breakfast
for
this
integument
i
say
these
minions
of
the
moon
had
blankets
round
their
shoulders
thrown
back
in
preparation
for
actual
service
instead
of
those
authentic
in
which
your
true
bandit
rejoices
like
a
new
malvolio
to
tie
up
his
legs
perhaps
to
keep
them
from
running
away
these
false
knaves
wore
some
of
them
ragged
boots
up
to
their
thighs
while
others
had
no
crural
coverings
at
all
and
only
rough
sandals
such
as
the
indians
there
use
between
their
feet
and
the
ground
they
were
picturesque
perhaps
but
not
attractive
to
wealthy
travellers
but
the
wealthy
travellers
were
attractive
to
them
so
they
came
together
all
the
same
such
as
they
were
however
there
they
were
fierce
sad
and
sallow
with
knives
in
their
belts
and
guns
of
various
parentage
in
their
hands
while
their
captain
bade
our
good
man
stand
and
deliver
there
was
no
room
for
choice
he
had
an
escort
to
be
sure
but
it
was
entirely
unequal
to
the
emergency
even
if
it
were
not
as
was
afterwards
shrewdly
suspected
in
league
with
the
robbers
the
enemy
had
the
advantage
of
arms
position
and
numbers
and
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
to
disgorge
his
hoarded
gains
at
once
or
to
have
his
breath
stripped
first
and
his
estate
summarily
administered
upon
afterwards
by
these
his
casual
heirs
as
the
king
of
france
by
virtue
of
his
would
have
confiscated
yorick
six
shirts
and
pair
of
black
silk
breeches
in
spite
of
his
eloquent
protest
against
such
injustice
had
he
chanced
to
die
in
his
most
christian
majesty
dominions
as
signor
g
had
an
estate
in
his
breath
from
which
he
could
draw
a
larger
yearly
rent
than
the
rolls
of
many
a
spanish
grandee
could
boast
he
wisely
chose
the
part
of
discretion
and
surrendered
at
the
same
his
new
acquaintances
showed
themselves
expert
practitioners
in
the
breaking
open
of
trunks
and
the
rifling
of
all
his
beloved
doubloons
all
his
cherished
dollars
for
the
which
no
yankee
ever
felt
a
stronger
passion
took
swift
wings
and
flew
from
his
coffers
to
alight
in
the
hands
of
the
adversary
the
sacred
recesses
of
his
pockets
and
those
of
his
companions
were
sacred
no
longer
from
the
sacrilegious
hands
of
the
spoilers
the
were
ravished
from
the
for
in
those
days
studs
were
not
and
the
rings
snatched
from
the
reluctant
fingers
all
the
shining
testimonials
of
mexican
admiration
were
transferred
with
the
celerity
of
magic
into
the
possession
of
the
chivalry
of
the
road
not
faulconbridge
himself
could
have
been
more
resolved
to
come
on
at
the
beckoning
of
gold
and
silver
than
were
they
and
good
catholics
though
they
were
it
is
most
likely
that
bell
book
and
candle
would
have
had
as
little
restraining
influence
over
them
as
he
professed
to
feel
at
last
they
rested
from
their
labors
to
the
victors
belonged
the
spoils
as
they
discovered
with
instinctive
sagacity
that
they
should
do
though
the
apophthegm
had
not
yet
received
the
authentic
seal
of
american
statesmanship
science
and
skill
had
done
their
utmost
and
poor
g
and
his
companions
in
misery
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
ring
stripped
of
everything
but
the
clothes
on
their
backs
the
duty
of
the
day
being
satisfactorily
performed
the
victors
felt
that
they
had
a
right
to
some
relaxation
after
their
toils
and
now
a
change
came
over
them
which
might
have
reminded
signor
g
of
the
banditti
of
the
with
whose
habits
he
had
been
so
long
familiar
and
whose
operations
he
had
himself
directed
some
one
of
the
troop
who
however
fit
for
stratagems
and
spoils
had
yet
music
in
his
soul
called
aloud
for
a
song
the
idea
was
hailed
with
acclamations
not
satisfied
with
the
capitalized
results
of
his
voice
to
which
they
had
helped
themselves
they
were
unwilling
to
let
their
prey
go
until
they
had
also
ravished
from
him
some
specimens
of
the
airy
mintage
whence
they
had
issued
accordingly
the
catholic
vagabonds
seated
themselves
on
the
ground
a
fuliginous
parterre
to
look
upon
and
called
upon
g
for
a
song
a
rock
which
projected
itself
from
the
side
of
the
hill
served
for
a
stage
as
well
as
the
green
plat
in
the
wood
near
athens
did
for
the
company
of
manager
quince
and
there
was
no
need
of
a
as
poor
g
had
no
clothes
to
change
for
those
he
stood
in
not
the
hebrews
by
the
waters
of
babylon
when
their
captors
demanded
of
them
a
song
of
zion
had
less
stomach
for
the
task
but
the
prime
tenor
was
now
before
an
audience
that
would
brook
neither
denial
nor
excuse
nor
hoarseness
nor
catarrh
nor
sudden
illness
certified
unto
by
the
friendly
physician
would
avail
him
now
the
demand
was
irresistible
for
when
he
hesitated
the
persuasive
though
stern
mouth
of
a
musket
hinted
to
him
in
expressive
silence
that
he
had
better
prevent
its
speech
with
song
so
he
had
to
make
his
first
appearance
upon
that
unworthy
scaffold
before
an
audience
which
multifold
as
his
experience
had
been
was
one
such
as
he
had
never
sung
to
yet
as
the
shadows
of
evening
began
to
fall
rough
torches
of
pine
wood
were
lighted
and
shed
a
glare
such
as
salvator
rosa
loved
to
kindle
upon
a
scene
such
as
he
delighted
to
paint
the
rascals
had
taste
that
the
tenor
himself
could
not
deny
they
knew
the
choice
bits
of
the
operas
which
held
the
stage
forty
years
ago
and
they
called
for
them
wisely
and
applauded
his
efforts
vociferously
nay
more
in
the
height
of
their
enthusiasm
they
would
toss
him
one
of
his
own
doubloons
or
dollars
instead
of
the
bouquets
usually
hurled
at
singers
they
well
judged
that
these
flowers
that
never
fade
would
be
the
tribute
he
would
value
most
and
so
they
rewarded
his
meritorious
strains
out
of
his
own
stores
as
claude
du
val
or
richard
tarpin
in
the
golden
days
of
highway
robbery
would
sometimes
generously
return
a
guinea
to
a
traveller
he
had
just
lightened
of
his
purse
to
enable
him
to
continue
his
journey
it
was
lucky
for
the
unfortunate
g
that
their
approbation
took
this
solid
shape
or
he
would
have
been
badly
off
indeed
for
it
was
all
he
had
to
begin
the
world
with
over
again
after
his
appreciating
audience
had
exhausted
their
musical
repertory
and
had
as
many
encores
as
they
thought
good
they
broke
up
the
concert
and
betook
themselves
to
their
fastnesses
among
the
mountains
leaving
their
patient
to
find
his
way
to
the
coast
as
best
he
might
with
a
pocket
as
light
as
his
soul
was
heavy
at
vera
cruz
a
concert
or
two
furnished
him
with
the
means
of
embarking
himself
and
his
troupe
for
europe
and
leaving
the
new
world
forever
behind
him
and
here
i
must
leave
him
for
my
story
is
done
the
reader
hungering
for
a
moral
may
discern
that
though
signor
g
received
the
price
he
asked
for
his
lovely
daughter
it
advantaged
him
nothing
and
that
he
not
only
lost
it
all
but
it
was
the
occasion
of
his
losing
everything
else
he
had
this
is
very
well
as
far
as
it
goes
but
then
it
is
equally
true
that
actually
obtained
his
wife
and
that
mynheer
van
holland
paid
for
her
i
dare
say
all
this
can
be
reconciled
with
the
eternal
fitness
of
things
but
i
protest
i
do
see
how
it
is
to
be
done
it
is
all
a
muddle
in
my
mind
i
can
not
even
affirm
that
the
banditti
were
ever
hanged
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
unlucky
dutch
merchant
whose
goods
were
so
comically
mixed
up
with
this
whole
history
never
had
any
poetical
or
material
justice
for
his
loss
of
them
but
it
is
as
much
the
reader
business
as
mine
to
settle
these
casuistries
i
only
undertook
to
tell
him
who
it
was
that
paid
for
the
and
i
have
done
it
i
consider
that
a
good
story
said
the
consul
when
he
had
finished
the
narration
out
of
which
i
have
compounded
the
foregoing
and
what
is
not
always
the
case
with
a
good
story
it
is
a
true
one
i
cordially
concurred
with
my
honored
friend
in
this
opinion
and
if
the
reader
should
unfortunately
differ
from
me
on
this
point
i
beg
him
to
believe
that
it
is
entirely
my
fault
as
the
consul
told
it
to
me
it
was
an
excellent
good
story
poor
mynheer
van
holland
he
added
laughing
never
got
over
that
adventure
not
that
the
loss
was
material
to
him
he
was
too
rich
for
that
but
the
provocation
of
his
fifty
thousand
dollars
going
to
a
parcel
of
mexican
after
buying
an
for
a
frenchman
on
its
way
was
enough
to
rouse
even
dutch
to
the
he
could
not
abide
either
frenchmen
or
all
the
rest
of
his
life
and
by
jove
i
wonder
at
it
nor
i
neither
for
the
matter
of
that
two
rivers
thy
summer
voice
musketaquit
repeats
the
music
of
the
rain
but
sweeter
rivers
pulsing
flit
through
thee
as
thou
through
concord
plain
thou
in
thy
narrow
banks
art
pent
the
stream
i
love
unbounded
goes
through
flood
and
sea
and
firmament
through
light
through
life
it
forward
flows
i
see
the
inundation
sweet
i
hear
the
spending
of
the
stream
through
years
through
men
through
nature
fleet
through
passion
thought
through
power
and
dream
musketaquit
a
goblin
strong
of
shard
and
flint
makes
jewels
gay
they
lose
their
grief
who
hear
his
song
and
where
he
winds
is
the
day
of
day
so
forth
and
brighter
fares
my
stream
who
drink
it
shall
not
thirst
again
no
darkness
stains
its
equal
gleam
and
ages
drop
in
it
like
rain
the
autocrat
of
the
every
man
his
own
boswell
the
atlantic
obeys
the
moon
and
its
luniversary
has
come
round
again
i
have
gathered
up
some
hasty
notes
of
my
remarks
made
since
the
last
high
tides
which
i
respectfully
submit
please
to
remember
this
is
just
as
easy
and
just
as
formal
as
i
choose
to
make
it
i
never
saw
an
author
in
my
life
saving
perhaps
one
that
did
not
purr
as
audibly
as
a
domestic
cat
on
having
his
fur
smoothed
in
the
right
way
by
a
skilful
hand
but
let
me
give
you
a
caution
be
very
careful
how
you
tell
an
author
he
is
ten
to
one
he
will
hate
you
and
if
he
does
be
sure
he
can
do
you
a
mischief
and
very
probably
will
say
you
over
his
romance
or
his
verses
and
he
will
love
you
and
send
you
a
copy
you
can
laugh
over
that
as
much
as
you
like
in
private
wonder
why
authors
and
actors
are
ashamed
of
being
funny
why
there
are
obvious
reasons
and
deep
philosophical
ones
the
clown
knows
very
well
that
the
women
are
not
in
love
with
him
but
with
hamlet
the
fellow
in
the
black
cloak
and
plumed
hat
passion
never
laughs
the
wit
knows
that
his
place
is
at
the
tail
of
a
procession
if
you
want
the
deep
underlying
reason
i
must
take
more
time
to
tell
it
there
is
a
perfect
consciousness
in
every
form
of
wit
using
that
term
in
its
general
sense
that
its
essence
consists
in
a
partial
and
incomplete
view
of
whatever
it
touches
it
throws
a
single
ray
separated
from
the
rest
red
yellow
blue
or
any
intermediate
shade
upon
an
object
never
white
light
that
is
the
province
of
wisdom
we
get
beautiful
effects
from
wit
all
the
prismatic
colors
but
never
the
object
as
it
is
in
fair
daylight
a
pun
which
is
a
kind
of
wit
is
a
different
and
much
shallower
trick
in
mental
optics
throwing
the
of
two
objects
so
that
one
overlies
the
other
poetry
uses
the
rainbow
tints
for
special
effects
but
always
keeps
its
essential
object
in
the
purest
white
light
of
will
you
allow
me
to
pursue
this
subject
a
little
further
they
did
allow
me
at
that
time
for
somebody
happened
to
scrape
the
floor
with
his
chair
just
then
which
accidental
sound
as
all
must
have
noticed
has
the
instantaneous
effect
that
cutting
the
yellow
hair
had
upon
infelix
dido
it
broke
the
charm
and
that
breakfast
was
over
do
flatter
yourselves
that
friendship
authorizes
you
to
say
disagreeable
things
to
your
intimates
on
the
contrary
the
nearer
you
come
into
relation
with
a
person
the
more
necessary
do
tact
and
courtesy
become
except
in
cases
of
necessity
which
are
rare
leave
your
friend
to
learn
unpleasant
truths
from
his
enemies
they
are
ready
enough
to
tell
them
forgets
that
is
universal
when
you
read
the
story
of
the
archbishop
and
gil
blas
you
may
laugh
if
you
will
at
the
poor
old
man
delusion
but
do
forget
that
the
youth
was
the
greater
fool
of
the
two
and
that
his
master
served
such
a
booby
rightly
in
turning
him
out
of
doors
you
need
not
get
up
a
rebellion
against
what
i
say
if
you
find
everything
in
my
sayings
is
not
exactly
new
you
ca
possibly
mistake
a
man
who
means
to
be
honest
for
a
literary
pickpocket
i
once
read
an
introductory
lecture
that
looked
to
me
too
learned
for
its
latitude
on
examination
i
found
all
its
erudition
was
taken
from
if
i
had
been
i
should
have
shown
up
the
professor
who
had
once
belabored
me
in
his
feeble
way
but
one
can
generally
tell
these
wholesale
thieves
easily
enough
and
they
are
not
worth
the
trouble
of
putting
them
in
the
pillory
i
doubt
the
entire
novelty
of
my
remarks
just
made
on
telling
unpleasant
truths
yet
i
am
not
conscious
of
any
larceny
neither
make
too
much
of
flaws
and
occasional
overstatements
some
persons
seem
to
think
that
absolute
truth
in
the
form
of
rigidly
stated
propositions
is
all
that
conversation
admits
this
is
precisely
as
if
a
musician
should
insist
on
having
nothing
but
perfect
chords
and
simple
melodies
no
diminished
fifths
no
flat
sevenths
no
flourishes
on
any
account
now
it
is
fair
to
say
that
just
as
music
must
have
all
these
so
conversation
must
have
its
partial
truths
its
embellished
truths
its
exaggerated
truths
it
is
in
its
higher
forms
an
artistic
product
and
admits
the
ideal
element
as
much
as
pictures
or
statues
one
man
who
is
a
little
too
literal
can
spoil
the
talk
of
a
whole
tableful
of
men
of
yes
you
say
but
who
wants
to
hear
fanciful
people
nonsense
put
the
facts
to
it
and
then
see
where
it
is
certainly
if
a
man
is
too
fond
of
paradox
if
he
is
flighty
and
empty
if
instead
of
striking
those
fifths
and
sevenths
those
harmonious
discords
often
so
much
better
than
the
twinned
octaves
in
the
music
of
thought
if
instead
of
striking
these
he
jangles
the
chords
stick
a
fact
into
him
like
a
stiletto
but
remember
that
talking
is
one
of
the
fine
arts
the
noblest
the
most
important
and
the
most
difficult
and
that
its
fluent
harmonies
may
be
spoiled
by
the
intrusion
of
a
single
harsh
note
therefore
conversation
which
is
suggestive
rather
than
argumentative
which
lets
out
the
most
of
each
talker
results
of
thought
is
commonly
the
pleasantest
and
the
most
profitable
it
is
not
easy
at
the
best
for
two
persons
talking
together
to
make
the
most
of
each
other
thoughts
there
are
so
many
of
them
the
company
looked
as
if
they
wanted
an
explanation
when
john
and
thomas
for
instance
are
talking
together
it
is
natural
enough
that
among
the
six
there
should
be
more
or
less
confusion
and
misapprehension
our
landlady
turned
pale
no
doubt
she
thought
there
was
a
screw
loose
in
my
intellects
and
that
involved
the
probable
loss
of
a
boarder
a
person
who
wears
a
spanish
cloak
and
a
sad
cheek
fluted
by
the
passions
of
the
melodrama
whom
i
understand
to
be
the
professional
ruffian
of
the
neighboring
theatre
alluded
with
a
certain
lifting
of
the
brow
drawing
down
of
the
corners
of
the
mouth
and
somewhat
rasping
di
to
falstaff
nine
men
in
buckram
everybody
looked
up
i
believe
the
old
gentleman
opposite
was
afraid
i
should
seize
the
at
any
rate
he
slid
it
to
one
side
as
it
were
carelessly
i
think
i
said
i
can
make
it
plain
to
benjamin
franklin
here
that
there
are
at
least
six
personalities
distinctly
to
be
recognized
as
taking
part
in
that
dialogue
between
john
and
thomas
the
real
john
known
only
to
his
maker
john
ideal
john
never
the
three
johns
real
one
and
often
very
unlike
him
thomas
ideal
john
never
the
real
john
nor
john
but
often
very
unlike
either
the
real
thomas
three
thomases
thomas
ideal
thomas
john
ideal
thomas
only
one
of
the
three
johns
is
taxed
only
one
can
be
weighed
on
a
but
the
other
two
are
just
as
important
in
the
conversation
let
us
suppose
the
real
john
to
be
old
dull
and
but
as
the
higher
powers
have
not
conferred
on
men
the
gift
of
seeing
themselves
in
the
true
light
john
very
possibly
conceives
himself
to
be
youthful
witty
and
fascinating
and
talks
from
the
point
of
view
of
this
ideal
thomas
again
believes
him
to
be
an
artful
rogue
we
will
say
therefore
he
so
far
as
thomas
attitude
in
the
conversation
is
concerned
an
artful
rogue
though
really
simple
and
stupid
the
same
conditions
apply
to
the
three
thomases
it
follows
that
until
a
man
can
be
found
who
knows
himself
as
his
maker
knows
him
or
who
sees
himself
as
others
see
him
there
must
be
at
least
six
persons
engaged
in
every
dialogue
between
two
of
these
the
least
important
philosophically
speaking
is
the
one
that
we
have
called
the
real
person
no
wonder
two
disputants
often
get
angry
when
there
are
six
of
them
talking
and
listening
all
at
the
same
time
a
very
unphilosophical
application
of
the
above
remarks
was
made
by
a
young
fellow
answering
to
the
name
of
john
who
sits
near
me
at
table
a
certain
basket
of
peaches
a
rare
vegetable
little
known
to
was
on
its
way
to
me
this
unlettered
johannes
he
appropriated
the
three
that
remained
in
the
basket
remarking
that
there
was
just
one
apiece
for
him
i
convinced
him
that
his
practical
inference
was
hasty
and
illogical
but
in
the
mean
time
he
had
eaten
the
peaches
the
opinions
of
relatives
as
to
a
man
powers
are
very
commonly
of
little
value
not
merely
because
they
overrate
their
own
flesh
and
blood
as
some
may
suppose
on
the
contrary
they
are
quite
as
likely
to
underrate
those
whom
they
have
grown
into
the
habit
of
considering
like
themselves
the
advent
of
genius
is
like
what
florists
style
the
of
a
seedling
tulip
into
what
we
may
call
colors
ten
thousand
dingy
flowers
then
one
with
the
divine
streak
or
if
you
prefer
it
like
the
coming
up
in
old
jacob
garden
of
that
most
gentlemanly
little
fruit
the
seckel
pear
which
i
have
sometimes
seen
in
it
is
a
surprise
there
is
nothing
to
account
for
it
all
at
once
we
find
that
twice
two
make
nature
is
fond
of
what
are
called
this
little
book
of
life
which
she
has
given
into
the
hands
of
its
joint
possessors
is
commonly
one
of
the
old
bound
over
again
only
once
in
a
great
while
there
is
a
stately
poem
in
it
or
its
leaves
are
illuminated
with
the
glories
of
art
or
they
enfold
a
draft
for
untold
values
signed
by
the
millionfold
millionnaire
old
mother
herself
but
strangers
are
commonly
the
first
to
find
the
gift
that
came
with
the
little
book
it
may
be
questioned
whether
anything
can
be
conscious
of
its
own
flavor
whether
the
or
the
or
even
a
still
more
eloquently
silent
animal
that
might
be
mentioned
is
aware
of
any
personal
peculiarity
may
well
be
doubted
no
man
knows
his
own
voice
many
men
do
not
know
their
own
profiles
every
one
remembers
carlyle
famous
characteristics
article
allow
for
exaggerations
and
there
is
a
great
deal
in
his
doctrine
of
the
of
genius
it
comes
under
the
great
law
just
stated
this
incapacity
of
knowing
its
own
traits
is
often
found
in
the
family
as
well
as
in
the
individual
so
never
mind
what
your
cousins
brothers
sister
uncles
aunts
and
the
rest
say
about
the
fine
poem
you
have
written
but
send
it
postage
paid
to
the
editors
if
there
are
any
of
the
atlantic
which
by
the
way
is
not
so
called
because
it
is
a
as
some
dull
wits
wish
they
had
said
but
are
too
late
scientific
knowledge
even
in
the
most
modest
persons
has
mingled
with
it
a
something
which
partakes
of
insolence
absolute
peremptory
facts
are
bullies
and
those
who
keep
company
with
them
are
apt
to
get
a
bullying
habit
of
mind
not
of
manners
perhaps
they
may
be
soft
and
smooth
but
the
smile
they
carry
has
a
quiet
assertion
in
it
such
as
the
champion
of
the
heavy
weights
commonly
the
but
not
the
most
diffident
of
men
wears
upon
what
he
very
inelegantly
calls
his
mug
take
the
man
for
instance
who
deals
in
the
mathematical
sciences
there
is
no
elasticity
in
a
mathematical
fact
if
you
bring
up

that

with
it
what
the

it

of

that
handle

oh
you
need
not
tell
me
that
and
are
the
most
gracious
unassuming
people
in
the
world
and
yet
preëminent
in
the
ranges
of
science
i
am
referring
to
i
know
that
as
well
as
you
but
mark
this
which
i
am
going
to
say
once
for
all
if
i
had
not
force
enough
to
project
a
principle
full
in
the
face
of
the
half
dozen
most
obvious
facts
which
seem
to
contradict
it
i
would
think
only
in
single
file
from
this
day
forward
a
rash
man
once
visiting
a
certain
noted
institution
at
south
boston
ventured
to
express
the
sentiment
that
man
is
a
rational
being
an
old
woman
who
was
an
attendant
in
the
idiot
school
contradicted
the
statement
and
appealed
to
the
facts
before
the
speaker
to
disprove
it
the
rash
man
stuck
to
his
hasty
generalization
notwithstanding
it
is
my
desire
to
be
useful
to
those
with
whom
i
am
associated
in
my
daily
relations
i
not
unfrequently
practise
the
divine
art
of
music
in
company
with
our
landlady
daughter
who
as
i
mentioned
before
is
the
owner
of
an
accordion
having
myself
a
barytone
voice
of
more
than
half
an
octave
in
compass
i
sometimes
add
my
vocal
powers
to
her
execution
of
thou
thou
in
this
bosom
not
however
unless
her
mother
or
some
other
discreet
female
is
present
to
prevent
misinterpretation
or
remark
i
have
also
taken
a
good
deal
of
interest
in
benjamin
franklin
before
referred
to
sometimes
called
or
more
frequently
frank
in
imitation
of
that
felicitous
abbreviation
combining
dignity
and
convenience
adopted
by
some
of
his
betters
my
acquaintance
with
the
french
language
is
very
imperfect
i
having
never
studied
it
anywhere
but
in
paris
which
is
awkward
as
devoted
himself
to
it
with
the
peculiar
advantage
of
an
alsacian
teacher
the
boy
i
think
is
doing
well
between
us
notwithstanding
the
following
is
an
french
exercise
written
by
this
young
gentleman
his
mother
thinks
it
very
creditable
to
his
abilities
though
being
unacquainted
with
the
french
language
her
judgment
can
not
be
considered

think
this
exercise
which
i
have
not
corrected
or
allowed
to
be
touched
in
any

is

french
fathers
of

find
it

the
passage
was
originally
taken

lately
published

this
was
translated

it
was
republished
at

with

the
notes
consist
of
an

and
a

our

this
may
be
compared
with
the
original
to
be
found
on
shelf
division

of
the
public
library
of
this
metropolis
some
of
you
boarders
ask
me
from
time
to
time
why
i
do
write
a
story
or
a
novel
or
something
of
that
kind
instead
of
answering
each
one
of
you
separately
i
will
thank
you
to
step
up
into
the
wholesale
department
for
a
few
moments
where
i
deal
in
answers
by
the
piece
and
by
the
bale
that
every
human
being
has
in
him
stuff
for
one
novel
in
three
volumes
duodecimo
has
long
been
with
me
a
cherished
belief
it
has
been
maintained
on
the
other
hand
that
many
persons
can
not
write
more
than
one
novel
that
all
after
that
are
likely
to
be
life
is
so
much
more
tremendous
a
thing
in
its
heights
and
depths
than
any
transcript
of
it
can
be
that
all
records
of
human
experience
are
as
so
many
bound
to
the
innumerable
glowing
glistening
rustling
breathing
leaves
and
flowers
of
the
forest
and
the
prairies
all
we
can
do
with
books
of
human
experience
is
to
make
them
alive
again
with
something
borrowed
from
our
own
lives
we
can
make
a
book
alive
for
us
just
in
proportion
to
its
resemblance
in
essence
or
in
form
to
our
own
experience
now
an
author
first
novel
is
naturally
drawn
to
a
great
extent
from
his
personal
experiences
that
is
is
a
literal
copy
of
nature
under
various
slight
disguises
but
the
moment
the
author
gets
out
of
his
personality
he
must
have
the
creative
power
as
well
as
the
narrative
art
and
the
sentiment
in
order
to
tell
a
living
story
and
this
is
rare
besides
there
is
great
danger
that
a
man
first
shall
clean
him
out
so
to
speak
of
his
best
thoughts
most
lives
though
their
stream
is
loaded
with
sand
and
turbid
with
alluvial
waste
drop
a
few
golden
grains
of
wisdom
as
they
flow
along
oftentimes
a
single
gets
them
all
and
after
that
the
poor
man
labor
is
only
rewarded
by
mud
and
worn
pebbles
all
which
proves
that
i
as
an
individual
of
the
human
family
could
write
one
novel
or
story
at
any
rate
if
i
would
why
do
i
then
well
there
are
several
reasons
against
it
in
the
first
place
i
should
tell
all
my
secrets
and
i
maintain
that
verse
is
the
proper
medium
for
such
revelations
rhythm
and
rhyme
and
the
harmonies
of
musical
language
the
play
of
fancy
the
fire
of
imagination
the
flashes
of
passion
so
hide
the
nakedness
of
a
heart
laid
open
that
hardly
any
confession
transfigured
in
the
luminous
halo
of
poetry
is
reproached
as
a
beauty
shows
herself
under
the
chandeliers
protected
by
the
glitter
of
her
diamonds
with
such
a
broad
snowdrift
of
white
arms
and
shoulders
laid
bare
that
were
she
unadorned
and
in
plain
calico
she
would
be
unendurable
in
the
opinion
of
the
ladies
again
i
am
terribly
afraid
i
should
show
up
all
my
friends
i
should
like
to
know
if
all
do
not
do
this
now
i
am
afraid
all
my
friends
would
not
bear
showing
up
very
well
for
they
have
an
average
share
of
the
common
weakness
of
humanity
which
i
am
pretty
certain
would
come
out
of
all
that
have
told
stories
among
us
there
is
hardly
one
i
can
recall
that
has
not
drawn
too
faithfully
some
living
portrait
that
might
better
have
been
spared
once
more
i
have
sometimes
thought
it
possible
i
might
be
too
dull
to
write
such
a
story
as
i
should
wish
to
write
and
finally
i
think
it
very
likely
i
write
a
story
one
of
these
days
do
be
surprised
at
anytime
if
you
see
me
coming
out
with
the
schoolmistress
or
the
old
gentleman
opposite
schoolmistress
and
old
gentleman
that
sits
opposite
had
left
the
table
before
i
said
this
i
want
my
glory
for
writing
the
same
discounted
now
on
the
spot
if
you
please
i
will
write
when
i
get
ready
how
many
people
live
on
the
reputation
of
the
reputation
they
might
have
made
i
saw
you
smiled
when
i
spoke
about
the
possibility
of
my
being
too
dull
to
write
a
good
story
i
do
pretend
to
know
what
you
meant
by
it
but
i
take
occasion
to
make
a
remark
that
may
hereafter
prove
of
value
to
some
among
when
one
of
us
who
has
been
led
by
native
vanity
or
senseless
flattery
to
think
himself
or
herself
possessed
of
talent
arrives
at
the
full
and
final
conclusion
that
he
or
she
is
really
dull
it
is
one
of
the
most
tranquillizing
and
blessed
convictions
that
can
enter
a
mortal
mind
all
our
failures
our
our
strange
disappointments
in
the
effect
of
our
efforts
are
lifted
from
our
bruised
shoulders
and
fall
like
christian
pack
at
the
feet
of
that
omnipotence
which
has
seen
fit
to
deny
us
the
pleasant
gift
of
high
intelligence
with
which
one
look
may
overflow
us
in
some
wider
sphere
of
being
how
sweetly
and
honestly
one
said
to
me
the
other
day
i
hate
books
a
gentleman
singularly
free
from
affectations
not
learned
of
course
but
of
perfect
breeding
which
is
often
so
much
better
than
learning
by
no
means
dull
in
the
sense
of
knowledge
of
the
world
and
society
but
certainly
not
clever
either
in
the
arts
or
sciences
his
company
is
pleasing
to
all
who
know
him
i
did
not
recognize
in
him
inferiority
of
literary
taste
half
so
distinctly
as
i
did
simplicity
of
character
and
fearless
acknowledgment
of
his
inaptitude
for
scholarship
in
fact
i
think
there
are
a
great
many
gentlemen
and
others
who
read
with
a
mark
to
keep
their
place
that
really
hate
books
but
never
had
the
wit
to
find
it
out
or
the
manliness
to
own
it
i
always
read
with
a
mark
we
get
into
a
way
of
thinking
as
if
what
we
call
an
intellectual
man
was
as
a
matter
of
course
made
up
of
or
thereabouts
of
and
himself
but
even
if
he
is
actually
so
compounded
he
need
not
read
much
society
is
a
strong
solution
of
books
it
draws
the
virtue
out
of
what
is
best
worth
reading
as
hot
water
draws
the
strength
of
if
i
were
a
prince
i
would
hire
or
buy
a
private
literary
in
which
i
would
steep
all
the
leaves
of
new
books
that
promised
well
the
infusion
would
do
for
me
without
the
vegetable
fibre
you
understand
me
i
would
have
a
person
whose
sole
business
should
be
to
read
day
and
night
and
talk
to
me
whenever
i
wanted
him
to
i
know
the
man
i
would
have
a
incisive
fellow
knows
history
or
at
any
rate
has
a
shelf
full
of
books
about
it
which
he
can
use
handily
and
the
same
of
all
useful
arts
and
sciences
knows
all
the
common
plots
of
plays
and
novels
and
the
stock
company
of
characters
that
are
continually
coming
on
in
new
costume
can
give
you
a
criticism
of
an
octavo
in
an
epithet
and
a
wink
and
you
can
depend
on
it
cares
for
nobody
except
for
the
virtue
there
is
in
what
he
says
delights
in
taking
off
big
wigs
and
professional
gowns
and
in
the
disembalming
and
unbandaging
of
all
literary
mummies
yet
he
is
as
tender
and
reverential
to
all
that
bears
the
mark
of
genius
that
is
of
a
new
influx
of
truth
or
beauty
as
a
nun
over
her
missal
in
short
he
is
one
of
those
men
that
know
everything
except
how
to
make
a
living
him
would
i
keep
on
the
square
next
my
own
royal
compartment
on
life
chessboard
to
him
i
would
push
up
another
pawn
in
the
shape
of
a
comely
and
wise
young
woman
whom
he
would
of
course
take
to
wife
for
all
contingencies
i
would
liberally
provide
in
a
word
i
would
in
the
plebeian
but
expressive
phrase
put
him
through
all
the
material
part
of
life
see
him
sheltered
warmed
fed
and
all
that
just
to
be
able
to
lay
on
his
talk
when
i
liked
with
the
privilege
of
shutting
it
off
at
will
a
club
is
the
next
best
thing
to
this
strung
like
a
harp
with
about
a
dozen
ringing
intelligences
each
answering
to
some
chord
of
the
macrocosm
they
do
well
to
dine
together
once
in
a
while
a
made
up
of
such
elements
is
the
last
triumph
of
civilization
over
barbarism
nature
and
art
combine
to
charm
the
senses
the
equatorial
zone
of
the
system
is
soothed
by
artifices
the
faculties
are
off
duty
and
fall
into
their
natural
attitudes
you
see
wisdom
in
slippers
and
science
in
a
short
jacket
the
whole
force
of
conversation
depends
on
how
much
you
can
take
for
granted
vulgar
have
to
play
their
game
out
nothing
short
of
the
brutality
of
an
actual
checkmate
satisfies
their
dull
apprehensions
but
look
at
two
masters
of
that
noble
game
white
stands
well
enough
so
far
as
you
can
see
but
red
says
mate
in
six
moves
white
looks
nods
the
game
is
over
just
so
in
talking
with
men
especially
when
they
are
and
expansive
as
they
are
apt
to
be
at
table
that
blessed
clairvoyance
which
sees
into
things
without
opening
them
that
glorious
license
which
having
shut
the
door
and
driven
the
reporter
from
its
calls
upon
truth
majestic
virgin
to
get
off
from
her
pedestal
and
drop
her
academic
poses
and
take
a
festive
garland
and
the
vacant
place
on
the
that
of
questions
and
replies
and
comments
large
axioms
bowled
over
the
mahogany
like
from
professional
mortars
and
explosive
wit
dropping
its
trains
of
fire
and
the
rain
of
pelting
everybody
that
shows
himself
the
picture
of
a
truly
intellectual
banquet
is
one
that
the
old
divinities
might
well
have
attempted
to
reproduce
in
their
oh
oh
oh
cried
the
young
fellow
whom
they
call
john
that
is
from
one
of
your
lectures
i
know
it
i
replied
i
concede
it
i
confess
it
i
proclaim
it
the
trail
of
the
serpent
is
over
them
all
all
lecturers
all
professors
all
have
ruts
and
grooves
in
their
minds
into
which
their
conversation
is
perpetually
sliding
did
you
never
in
riding
through
the
woods
of
a
still
june
evening
suddenly
feel
that
you
had
passed
into
a
warm
stratum
of
air
and
in
a
minute
or
two
strike
the
chill
layer
of
atmosphere
beyond
did
you
never
in
cleaving
the
green
waters
of
the
back
bay
where
the
provincial
are
in
the
habit
of
beating
the
metropolitan
find
yourself
in
a
tepid
streak
a
narrow
local
a
gratuitous
a
little
underdone
through
which
your
glistening
shoulders
soon
flashed
to
bring
you
back
to
the
cold
realities
of
temperature
just
so
in
talking
with
any
of
the
characters
above
referred
to
one
not
unfrequently
finds
a
sudden
change
in
the
style
of
the
conversation
the
eye
rayless
as
a
in
august
all
at
once
fills
with
light
the
face
flings
itself
wide
open
like
the
when
the
bride
and
bridegroom
enter
the
little
man
grows
in
stature
before
your
eyes
like
the
small
prisoner
with
hair
on
end
beloved
yet
dreaded
of
early
childhood
you
were
talking
with
a
dwarf
and
an
imbecile
you
have
a
giant
and
a
angel
before
you
nothing
but
a
streak
out
of
a
as
when
at
some
moment
the
mighty
springs
into
the
air
before
the
astonished
from
the
bosom
of
that
fair
sheet
sacred
to
the
hymns
of
quiet
batrachians
at
home
and
the
epigrams
of
a
less
amiable
and
less
elevated
order
of
in
other
latitudes
who
was
that
person
that
was
so
abused
some
time
since
for
saying
that
in
the
conflict
of
two
races
our
sympathies
naturally
go
with
the
higher
no
matter
who
he
was
now
look
at
what
is
going
on
in
india
a
white
superior
caucasian
race
against
a
inferior
but
still
caucasian
race
and
where
are
english
and
american
sympathies
we
ca
stop
to
settle
all
the
doubtful
questions
all
we
know
is
that
the
brute
nature
is
sure
to
come
out
most
strongly
in
the
lower
race
and
it
is
the
general
law
that
the
human
side
of
humanity
should
treat
the
brutal
side
as
it
does
the
same
nature
in
the
inferior
animals
tame
it
or
crush
it
the

of

of

briefly
that
i
should

it
much
lazier

to

it
down

thereon
before
you
go
this

i
want
to
read
you
a
copy
of
verses
you
will
understand
by
the
title
that
they
are
written
in
an
imaginary
character
i
do
doubt
they
will
fit
some
well
enough
i
send
it
forth
as

on

of
conviction
that
it
will
suit
somebody
there
is
no
loftier
illustration
of
faith
than
this
it
believes
that
a
soul
has
been
clad
in
flesh
that
tender
parents
have
fed
and
nurtured
it
that
its
mysterious
or
has
survived
its
myriad
exposures
and
reached
the
stature
of
maturity
that
the
man
now
has
given
in
his
adhesion
to
the
traditions
and
habits
of
the
race
in
favor
of
artificial

that
he

that

to

there
is
a
prophecy
in
every
seam
and
its
pockets
are
full
of
now
hear
the
verses
the
old

dreams
o
for
one
hour
of
youthful
joy
give
back
my
twentieth
spring
i
rather
laugh
a
boy
than
reign
a
king
off
with
the
wrinkled
spoils
of
age
away
with
learning
crown
tear
out
life
page
and
dash
its
trophies
down
one
moment
let
my
stream
from
boyhood
fount
of
flame
give
me
one
giddy
reeling
dream
of
life
all
love
and
fame
my
listening
angel
heard
the
prayer
and
calmly
smiling
said
if
i
but
touch
thy
silvered
hair
thy
hasty
wish
hath
sped
but
is
there
nothing
in
thy
track
to
bid
thee
fondly
stay
while
the
swift
seasons
hurry
back
to
find
the
day
ah
truest
soul
of
womankind
without
thee
what
were
life
one
bliss
i
can
not
leave
behind
i
take
my
precious
wife
the
angel
took
a
sapphire
pen
and
wrote
in
rainbow
dew
the
man
would
be
a
boy
again
and
be
a
husband
too
and
is
there
nothing
yet
unsaid
before
the
change
appears
remember
all
their
gifts
have
fled
with
those
dissolving
years
why
yes
for
memory
would
recall
my
fond
paternal
joys
i
could
not
bear
to
leave
them
all
i
take
my
girl
and
boys
the
smiling
angel
dropped
his
pen
why
this
will
never
do
the
man
would
be
a
boy
again
and
be
a
father
too
and
so
i
laughed
my
laughter
woke
the
household
with
its
noise
and
wrote
my
dream
when
morning
broke

into

claiming

long
a

and
peremptory
judgment
its
elements
must
of
necessity
be
gathered
slowly
from
many
and
scattered
sources
the
accumulated

of
the
great

of

the

of

the
keen

of

the

every

reach

warrant
for

the
work
of
agassiz
if
we
may
judge
it
by
the
portion
now
before
us
has
a
right
to
challenge
such
a
matured
opinion
and
to
wait
for
it
not
the
less
does
a
certain
duty
belong
to
us
as
literary
journalists
with
reference
to
these
stately
volumes
which
are
in
the
hands
of
thousands
learned
and
unlearned
and
of
which
there
are
scores
of
thousands
waiting
to
hear
our
duty
we
consider
to
be
first
that
of
recognition
in
terms
of
fitting
courtesy
secondly
of
analysis
for
the
general
reader
thirdly
of
accentuation
so
to
speak
of
what
seems
most
widely
applicable
or
interesting
and
lastly
of
making
such
comments
as
so
pregnant
a
text
may
suggest
and
first
of
recognition
here
are
the
fruits
of
ten
years
of
patient
labor
taken
out
of
the
heart
of
life
in
the
age
of
vigor
which
is
that
of
ambition
to
use
the
phrase
of
another
great
observer
by
a
man
of
large
endowments
and
of
vast
knowledge
assisted
by
skilful
collaborators
by
finished
artists
by
the
counsels
and
liberality
of
the
learned
few
and
the
generous
countenance
of
the
intelligent
many
before
analysis
before
criticism
there
should
be
uttered
a
welcome
not
grudging
not
envious
of
an
overshadowing
reputation
not
in
searching
for
qualifications
to
abate
its
warmth
not
carefully
taming
down
its
enthusiasm
to
tepid
formalisms
but
and
such
as
all
noble
works
and
deeds
should
claim
the
learned
men
of
past
centuries
have
left
us
an
example
of
this
treatment
of
authors
in
those
gratulatory
verses
with
which
they
were
wont
to
hail
every
considerable
literary
or
scientific
performance
they
knew
human
nature
well
they
knew
that
the
author
when
he
quenches
the
lamp
over
which
he
has
grown
haggard
and
pale
and
steps
from
his
cell
into
daylight
and
the
chill
outside
air
longs
longs
unutterably
for
kind
words
and
the
cheering
fellowship
of
kindred
souls
and
with
instinctive
grace
they
chose
the
poetical
form
of
expression
simply
because
this
alone
gives
full
license
to
the
lips
of
friendship
this
old
folio
which
stands
by
us
is
not
precious
only
because
it
contains
the
quaint
wisdom
and
manifold
experience
of
ambroise
paré
mingled
with
his
credulous
gossip
and
again
sweetened
by
his
simple
reverence
not
precious
alone
because
it
contains
the
noblest
words
ever
uttered
by
one
of
his
profession
le
pensay
et
dieu
le
but
also
because
pierre
ronsard
the
poet
of
france
has
left
his
deathless
name
thrice
inscribed
in
its
earlier
pages
at
the
foot
of
tributes
to
its
author
and
here
in
the
next
century
comes
schenck
of
grafenberg
staggering
under
his
monstrous
volume
of
casus
rariores
ready
to
fall
fainting
by
the
wayside
when
lo
the
shining
ones
meet
him
too
and
lift
him
and
lighten
him
with
the
utterance
of
these
distinct
poems
which
we
see
hung
up
on
so
many
votive
tablets
at
the
entrance
of
this
miniature
babel
of
science
even
so
late
as
the
last
century
the
genial
custom
survived
for
our
worthy
stalpart
van
der
wiel
whose
little
pair
of
volumes
was
published
in
can
boast
of
pages
of
commendatory
verse
much
of
it
in
his
native
dutch
a
little
of
which
goes
a
good
way
with
all
except
batavian
readers
but
as
the
arundines
cami
musical
as
they
are
have
lent
no
prelude
to
these
harmonies
of
science
we
must
say
in
a
few
plain
words
of
prose
our
own
first
thought
as
to
the
work
the
commencement
of
which
lies
before
us
we
believe
that
if
completed
according
to
its
promise
it
is
to
be
one
of
the
monumental
labors
of
our
century
comparisons
are
not
to
be
lightly
instituted
and
especially
under
circumstances
that
do
not
allow
a
fair
survey
of
the
whole
field
from
which
the
objects
to
be
compared
are
to
be
taken
we
suppose
however
it
will
be
conceded
that
the
sunset
continent
has
never
witnessed
anything
like
the
inception
of
this
mighty
task
in
the
way
of
systematic
natural
science
and
if
since
cuvier
the
greatest
of
naturalists
as
agassiz
considers
him
slept
with
the
fossils
to
which
he
had
given
life
there
has
been
any
other
student
of
nature
who
has
attempted
a
task
so
immense
with
the
same
union
of
observing
reflecting
analyzing
and
coördinating
power
we
can
not
name
him
our
civilization
has
a
right
to
be
proud
of
such
an
accession
to
its
thinking
and
laboring
constituency
it
is
also
bound
to
be
grateful
for
it
and
to
express
its
gratitude
it
is
just
one
hundred
years
since
another
swiss
the
magnificent
albert
von
haller
gave
to
the
world
the
first
volume
of
the
elementa
physiologiae
corporis
humani
nine
years
afterwards
in
the
last
of
the
eight
volumes
appeared
and
the
vast
structure
which
embodied
his
untiring
study
of
nature
his
erudition
his
deepest
thought
his
highest
imaginings
his
holiest
aspirations
stood
like
the
alps
whose
shadow
fell
upon
its
birthplace
the
lovely
lausaune
pride
of
the
pays
de
vaud
the
clepsydrae
that
measure
the
centuries
as
they
drop
from
the
dizzy
cliffs
the
glaciers
by
the
descent
of
which
time
is
marked
out
as
by
a
shadow
on
a
dial
and
which
thunder
out
the
high
noon
of
each
revolving
year
with
their
frozen
tongues
as
they
crack
beneath
the
summer
sun
have
registered
a
new
centennial
circle
and
at
the
very
hour
of
its
completion
switzerland
vindicates
her
ancient
renown
in
these
fair
pages
at
once
pledge
and
performance
of
another
of
her
honored
children
may
the
auspicious
omen
lead
to
as
happy
a
conclusion
lovingly
then
we
lay
open
the
generous
quarto
and
look
upon
its
broad
bright
it
tells
us
that
we
have
here
the
first
of
a
series
of
contributions
to
the
natural
history
of
the
united
states
of
america
we
see
that
one
of
its
three
parts
embraces
the
largest
generalities
of
natural
science
under
the
head
of
an
essay
on
classification
we
see
that
the
other
two
parts
are
devoted
to
the
description
and
delineation
of
a
single
order
of
reptilia
the
testudinata
or
turtles
if
agassiz
had
intentionally
chosen
the
simplest
way
of
proving
that
he
had
naturalized
himself
in
new
england
he
could
not
have
selected
more
fortunately
than
he
has
done
by
adopting
our
word
to
cover
all
the
testudinates
to
an
englishman
a
turtle
is
a
that
for
a
brief
space
lies
on
his
back
and
fights
the
air
with
his
useless
paddles
in
the
of
a
bound
eventually
to
guildhall
there
to
feed
gog
and
magog
or
his
worshippers
known
as
aldermen
for
him
a
is
a
when
his
poets
and
romancers
speak
of
turtles
again
they
commonly
mean
not
half
so
swift
the
sailing
falcon
flies
that
drives
a
turtle
through
the
liquid
skies
the
only
flight
of
a
testudinate
which
we
remember
is
that
downward
one
of
the
unfortunate
tortoise
that
cracked
the
bald
crown
of
aeschylus
but
turtle
as
embracing
all
chelonians
or
as
liberal
shepherds
call
it
turkle
is
unquestionably
cisatlantic
the
distinguished
naturalist
has
made
himself
an
american
citizen
by
adopting
our
own
expression
and
should
have
the
freedom
of
all
our
cities
presented
to
him
in
the
shell
of
a
it
is
singular
to
recall
the
honors
which
have
been
bestowed
on
the
testudinates
from
all
antiquity
it
was
the
and
shell
of
a
tortoise
that
suggested
the
lyre
to
mercury
as
he
walked
by
the
shore
of
nilus
it
was
on
the
back
of
a
tortoise
that
the
indian
sage
placed
his
elephant
which
upheld
the
world
under
the
the
roman
legions
swarmed
into
the
walled
cities
of
the
and
in
that
wise
old
fable
which
childhood
learns
and
age
too
often
remembers
sorrowing
it
was
the
tortoise
that
won
the
race
against
the
swiftest
of
the
smaller
tribes
his
competitor
and
here
once
more
we
have
his
shell
strung
with
vibrating
thoughts
that
repeat
the
harmonies
of
nature
once
more
his
broad
back
stoops
to
the
weighty
problems
which
the
planet
proposes
to
its
children
once
more
the
great
cities
are
stormed
by
science
beneath
his
coat
of
mail
once
more
he
has
run
the
race
not
against
the
hare
only
but
the
whole
animal
kingdom
and
won
it
and
with
it
the
new
fame
which
awaits
him
as
he
leads
in
the
long
array
of
his
fellows
that
are
to
come
up
one
by
one
in
these
enduring
records
and
so
we
turn
the
leaf
and
come
to
the
dedication
the
dedication
of
a
work
like
this
destined
to
preserve
all
the
names
it
enrols
in
the
immortality
of
science

delays
us
for
a
moment
of
the
foreign
teacher
and
friend
to
whom
the
author
owes
some
of
his
earliest
lessons
and
of
that
group
of
our
own
citizens
most
of
them
still
living
who
lent
their
united
efforts
to
the
enterprise
of
publication
after
it
was
commenced
we
need
not
speak
individually
but
we
can
not
pass
over
the
name
of
francis
calley
gray
without
a
word
of
grateful
remembrance
for
one
who
was
the
friend
and
adviser
of
the
author
in
planning
the
publication
of
the
work
before
us
we
who
remember
his
varied
culture
his
large
and
fluent
discourse
with
its
formidable
accuracy
of
knowledge
and
gracious
suavity
of
utterance
his
taste
in
literature
and
art
which
made
his
home
a
suite
of
princely
cabinets
his
generous
and
elegant
hospitality
which
scholars
and
artists
knew
so
well
counting
him
as
the
peer
and
in
many
points
the
more
than
peer
of
such
as
the
wide
world
of
letters
is
proud
to
claim
are
pleased
to
see
that
his
cherished
name
will
be
read
by
the
students
of
unborn
generations
on
the
first
leaf
of
this
noble
record
of
the
science
of
our
own
the
preface
which
follows
the
dedication
is
full
of
grateful
acknowledgments
to
the
many
friends
of
science
in
all
parts
of
the
country
who
came
forward
to
lend
their
aid
in
various
forms
especially
in
collecting
and
transmitting
specimens
from
the
most
widely
remote
sections
of
the
continent
the
pious
zeal
of
winthrop
sargent
who
brought
a
cargo
of
living
turtles
more
than
a
thousand
miles
to
the
of
testudinous
learning
at
cambridge
is
only
paralleled
by
the
memorable
act
of
the
pisans
in
transporting
of
holy
soil
from
palestine
to
fill
their
campo
santo
genius
is
marked
by
nothing
more
distinctly
than
that
it
makes
the
world
its
tributary
he
from
whose
lips
it
speaks
has
but
to
look
calmly
into
the
eyes
of
dull
routine
of
jaded
toil
of
fickle
childhood
and
utter
the
words
follow
me
officials
close
their
books
tired
fishermen

their
nets
riotous
boys
forsake
their

to

the
master
bidding
is
he
making
collections
for
some
great
purpose
of
study
piece
by
piece
the
fragmentary
spoils
flow
in
upon
him
of
all
sizes
shapes
and
hues
a
chaos
of
confused
riches
perhaps
only
a
wealth
of
rubbish
as
they
lie
at
his
feet
one
by
one
they
fall
into
harmonious
relations
until
the
meaningless
heap
has
become
a
vast
mosaic
where
nothing
is
too
minute
to
fill
some
interstice
nothing
too
angular
to
fit
some
corner
nothing
so
dull
or
brilliant
of
tint
that
it
will
not
furnish
its
fraction
of
light
or
shadow
such
has
been
the
history
of
those
years
of
labor
the
results
of
which
these
volumes
present
to
us
whatever
may
have
been
said
of
the
devotion
of
our
countrymen
to
material
interests
the
wise
and
winning
lips
had
only
to
speak
and
such
a
currency
of
and
was
set
in
circulation
that
the
contemplative
stranger
who
saw
the
mighty
coinage
of
chelonia
flowing
in
upon
cambridge
might
well
have
thought
that
the
national
idea
was
not
the
almighty
dollar
but
the
almighty
turtle
agassiz
places
a
high
estimate
on
the
intelligence
as
well
as
the
kind
spirit
of
his
adopted
countrymen
there
is
not
a
class
of
learned
men
here
he
says
distinct
from
the
other
cultivated
members
of
the
community
on
the
contrary
so
general
is
the
desire
for
knowledge
that
i
expect
to
see
my
book
read
by
operatives
by
fishermen
by
farmers
quite
as
extensively
as
by
the
students
of
our
colleges
or
by
the
learned
professions
and
it
is
but
proper
that
i
should
endeavor
to
make
myself
understood
by
all
the
deficiencies
of
our
scientific
libraries
and
the
want
of
a
class
of
elementary
works
upon
natural
history
such
as
are
widely
circulated
in
europe
are
adverted
to
and
alleged
as
a
reason
for
entering
into
details
which
the
professional
naturalist
might
think
misplaced
we
quote
one
paragraph
entire
from
the
preface
as
not
susceptible
of
being
abridged
and
as
briefly
stating
those
general
facts
with
regard
to
the
work
which
all
our
readers
must
desire
to
know
i
have
a
few
words
more
to
say
respecting
the
two
first
volumes
now
ready
for
publication
considering
the
uncertainty
of
human
life
i
have
wished
to
bring
out
at
once
a
work
that
would
exemplify
the
nature
of
the
investigations
i
have
been
tracing
during
the
last
ten
years
and
show
what
is
likely
to
be
the
character
of
the
whole
series
i
have
aimed
therefore
in
preparing
these
two
volumes
to
combine
them
in
such
a
manner
as
that
they
should
form
a
whole
the
first
part
contains
an
exposition
of
the
general
views
i
have
arrived
at
thus
far
in
my
studies
of
natural
history
the
second
part
shows
how
i
have
attempted
to
apply
these
results
to
the
special
study
of
zoology
taking
the
order
of
testudinata
as
an
example
i
believe
that
in
america
where
turtles
are
everywhere
common
and
greatly
diversified
a
student
could
not
make
a
better
beginning
than
by
a
careful
perusal
of
this
part
specimens
in
hand
with
constant
reference
to
the
second
chapter
of
the
first
part
the
third
part
exemplifies
the
bearing
of
embryology
upon
these
general
questions
while
it
contains
the
fullest
illustration
of
the
embryonic
growth
of
the
testudinata
the
preface
closes
with
honorable
mention
of
the
gentlemen
who
have
furnished
direct
assistance
in
the
preparation
of
the
work
and
especially
of
clark
in
microscopic
observation
and
illustration
and
of
sonrel
in
drawing
the
zoological
figures
the
list
of
subscribers
is
not
without
its
special
meaning
and
interest
if
as
has
been
said
the
grade
of
civilization
in
any
community
can
be
estimated
by
the
amount
of
sulphuric
acid
it
consumes
the
extent
to
which
a
work
like
this
has
been
called
for
in
different
sections
of
the
country
may
to
some
extent
be
considered
an
index
of
its
intellectual
aspirations
if
not
of
its
actual
progress
this
is
especially
true
of
those
remoter
regions
where
personal
motives
would
exercise
least
influence
but
without
instituting
any
comparisons
we
may
well
be
proud
of
this
ample
list
of
hundred
subscribers
most
of
them
citizens
of
the
republic
a
support
such
as
was
never
before
offered
to
any
scientific
man
for
purely
scientific
ends
without
any
reference
to
government
objects
or
direct
practical
aims
our
analysis
must
confine
itself
mainly
to
the
first
of
the
three
parts
into
which
these
two
volumes
are
divided
this
first
part
it
is
that
contains
those
large
results
which
every
thinker
must
desire
to
learn
from
one
whose
life
has
been
devoted
to
the
searching
and
contemplative
study
of
nature
it
is
in
the
realm
of
thought
here
explored
that
natural
science
whose
figure
we
are
wont
to
look
down
upon
crouching
to
her
task
like
him
of
the
as
he
painfully
gathers
together
his
sticks
and
straws
rises
erect
and
lifts
her
forehead
into
the
upper
atmosphere
of
philosophy
where
the
clouds
are
indeed
thickest
but
the
stars
are
nearest
the
second
and
third
parts
belong
more
exclusively
to
the
professed
students
of
natural
history
in
its
different
special
departments
our
notice
of
these
divisions
of
the
work
must
therefore
be
comparatively
brief
the
first
chapter
of
the
first
part
has
for
its
title
the
fundamental
relations
of
animals
to
one
another
and
to
the
world
in
which
they
live
as
the
basis
of
the
natural
system
of
animals
certain
general
doctrines
the
spirit
of
which
runs
through
all
the
scientific
works
of
agassiz
are
distinctly
laid
down
in
the
first
section
of
this
chapter
it
is
headed
with
the
statement
the
leading
features
of
a
natural
zoological
system
are
all
founded
in
nature
the
systems
named
from
the
great
leaders
of
science
are
but
translations
of
the
creator
thoughts
into
human
language
if
it
can
be
proved
that
man
has
not
invented
but
only
traced
this
systematic
arrangement
in
nature
that
these
relations
and
proportions
which
exist
throughout
the
animal
and
vegetable
world
have
an
intellectual
an
ideal
connection
in
the
mind
of
the
creator
that
this
plan
of
creation
which
so
commends
itself
to
our
highest
wisdom
has
not
grown
out
of
the
necessary
action
of
physical
laws
but
was
the
free
conception
of
the
almighty
intellect
matured
in
his
thought
before
it
was
manifested
in
tangible
external
forms
if
in
short
we
can
prove
premeditation
prior
to
the
act
of
creation
we
have
done
once
and
forever
with
the
desolate
theory
which
refers
us
to
the
laws
of
matter
as
accounting
for
all
the
wonders
of
the
universe
and
leaves
us
with
no
god
but
the
monotonous
unvarying
action
of
physical
forces
binding
all
things
to
their
inevitable
destiny
one
more
extract
must
be
given
from
this
section
for
it
is
the
key
to
the
general
argument
which
follows
i
disclaim
every
intention
of
introducing
in
this
work
any
evidence
irrelevant
to
my
subject
or
of
supporting
any
conclusions
not
immediately
flowing
from
it
but
i
can
not
overlook
nor
disregard
here
the
close
connection
there
is
between
the
facts
ascertained
by
scientific
investigations
and
the
discussions
now
carried
on
respecting
the
origin
of
organized
beings
and
though
i
know
those
who
hold
it
to
be
very
unscientific
to
believe
that
thinking
is
not
something
inherent
in
matter
and
that
there
is
an
essential
difference
between
inorganic
and
living
and
thinking
beings
i
shall
not
be
prevented
by
any
such
pretensions
of
a
false
philosophy
from
expressing
my
conviction
that
as
long
as
it
can
not
be
shown
that
matter
or
physical
forces
do
actually
reason
i
shall
consider
any
manifestation
of
thought
as
evidence
of
the
existence
of
a
thinking
being
as
the
author
of
such
thought
and
shall
look
upon
an
intelligent
and
intelligible
connection
between
the
facts
of
nature
as
direct
proof
of
the
existence
of
a
thinking
god
as
certainly
as
man
exhibits
the
power
of
thinking
when
he
recognizes
their
natural
relations
we
must
content
ourselves
with
the
most
general
statement
of
the
nature
and
bearing
of
the
series
of
propositions
which
follow
they
are
illustrated
by
a
large
survey
of
the
material
universe
in
its
manifestations
of
life
and
of
the
relations
between
the
various
forms
of
life
to
each
other
and
to
the
inorganic
world
these
propositions
in
number
might
be
called
an
analysis
of
the
qualities
of
the
infinite
mind
exhibited
in
the
realm
of
organized
and
especially
of
animal
being
nothing
but
want
of
space
prevents
our
reproducing
at
full
length
the
very
careful
recapitulation
to
be
found
at
the
close
of
the
chapter
or
the
analysis
to
be
found
in
the
table
of
contents
with
something
more
of
labor
than
the
task
of
copying
would
have
been
we
have
attempted
to
compress
the
truths
already
crowded
in
these
brief
and
pregnant
sentences
into
the
still
narrower
compass
of
a
few
lines
in
our
straitened
pages
the
harmony
of
the
universe
is
a
manifestation
of
illimitable
intellect
displaying
itself
in
various
modes
of
thought
as
these
are
shown
in
the
characters
and
relations
of
organized
beings
unity
of
thought
manifesting
itself
independently
of
space
of
time
of
known
material
agencies
of
special
form
illustrated
by
repetition
of
similar
types
in
different
circumstances
by
identities
or
partial
resemblances
or
serial
connections
found
under
varying
conditions
of
being
power
of
expressing
the
same
idea
in
innumerable
forms
as
in
those
instances
of
essential
identity
of
parts
in
the
midst
of
formal
differences
known
as
power
of
combination
as
in
the
adjustment
of
organized
beings
to
each
other
and
to
the
inorganic
world
or
in
the
harmonious
allotment
of
the
most
varied
gifts
to
different
beings
definite
recognition
of
time
and
space
as
in
the
life
of
individuals
of
species
in
the
stages
of
growth
in
the
geographical
limitation
of
types
prescience
and
omniscience
as
shown
in
the
types
of
earlier
geological
ages
omnipresence
by
the
adjustment
of
the
whole
series
of
animal
organisms
to
the
various
parts
of
the
planet
they
inhabit
the
final
of
agassiz
is
as
follows
we
may
sum
up
the
results
of
this
discussion
up
to
this
point
in
still
fewer
words
all
organized
beings
exhibit
in
themselves
all
those
categories
of
structure
and
of
existence
upon
which
a
natural
system
may
be
founded
in
such
a
manner
that
in
tracing
it
the
human
mind
is
only
translating
into
human
language
the
divine
thoughts
expressed
in
nature
in
living
realities
all
these
beings
do
not
exist
in
consequence
of
the
continued
agency
of
physical
causes
but
have
made
their
successive
appearance
upon
earth
by
the
immediate
intervention
of
the
creator
as
proof
i
may
sum
up
my
argument
in
the
following
manner
the
products
of
what
are
commonly
called
physical
agents
are
everywhere
the
same
that
is
upon
the
whole
surface
of
the
globe
and
have
always
been
the
same
that
is
during
all
geological
periods
while
organized
beings
are
everywhere
different
and
have
differed
in
all
ages
between
two
such
series
of
phenomena
there
can
be
no
causal
or
genetic
connection
the
combination
in
time
and
space
of
all
these
thoughtful
conceptions
exhibits
not
only
thought
it
shows
also
premeditation
power
wisdom
greatness
prescience
omniscience
providence
in
one
word
all
these
facts
in
their
natural
connection
proclaim
aloud
the
one
god
whom
man
may
know
adore
and
love
and
natural
history
must
in
good
time
become
the
analysis
of
the
thoughts
of
the
creator
of
the
universe
as
manifested
in
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
to
this
statement
we
must
add
two
paragraphs
from
the
pages
just
preceding
pp
if
i
have
succeeded
even
very
imperfectly
in
showing
that
the
various
relations
observed
between
animals
and
the
physical
world
as
well
as
between
themselves
exhibit
thought
it
follows
that
the
whole
has
an
intelligent
author
and
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
to
attempt
to
point
out
as
far
as
possible
the
difference
there
may
be
between
divine
thinking
and
human
thought
taking
nature
as
exhibiting
thought
for
my
guide
it
appears
to
me
that
while
human
thought
is
consecutive
divine
thought
is
simultaneous
embracing
at
the
same
time
and
forever
in
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
the
most
diversified
relations
among
hundreds
of
thousands
of
organized
beings
each
of
which
may
present
complications
again
which
to
study
and
understand
even
imperfectly
as
for
instance
man
himself
mankind
has
already
spent
thousands
of
years
and
yet
all
this
has
been
done
by
one
mind
must
be
the
work
of
one
mind
only
of
him
before
whom
man
can
only
bow
in
grateful
acknowledgment
of
the
prerogatives
he
is
allowed
to
enjoy
in
this
world
not
to
speak
of
the
promises
of
a
future
life
chapter
second
is
entitled
leading
groups
of
the
existing
systems
of
animals
its
nine
sections
treat
successively
of
the
great
types
or
branches
of
the
animal
kingdom
of
classes
orders
families
genera
species
other
natural
divisions
successive
development
of
characters
and
close
with
some
very
significant
conclusions
on
the
importance
of
the
study
of
classification
agassiz
has
attempted
to
give
definiteness
to
the
terms
above
enumerated
which
have
been
used
with
various
significance
by
limiting
each
one
of
them
to
covering
a
single
category
of
natural
relationship
thus
or
are
characterized
by
their
plan
of
structure
by
the
manner
in
which
that
plan
is
executed
so
far
as
ways
and
means
are
concerned
by
the
degrees
of
complication
of
that
structure
by
their
form
so
far
as
determined
by
structure
by
the
details
of
the
execution
in
special
parts
by
the
relations
of
individuals
to
one
another
and
to
the
world
in
which
they
live
as
well
as
by
the
proportions
of
their
parts
their
ornamentation
etc
and
yet
there
are
other
natural
divisions
which
must
be
acknowledged
in
a
natural
zoölogical
system
but
these
are
not
to
be
traced
so
uniformly
in
all
classes
as
the
former
they
are
in
reality
only
limitations
of
the
other
kinds
of
divisions
this
chapter
must
be
studied
in
the
original
text
the
arguments
by
which
its
conclusions
are
supported
hardly
admitting
of
brief
analysis
the
most
superficial
reader
will
be
interested
in
account
of
the
mode
in
which
he
sought
for
the
natural
boundaries
of
the
various
divisions
by
observing
the
special
point
of
view
in
which
various
eminent
naturalists
have
considered
their
subject
as
for
instance
audubon
among
the
biographers
of
species
latreille
among
the
students
of
genera
and
cuvier
at
the
head
of
those
who
have
contemplated
the
higher
groups
such
as
classes
and
types
the
most
indifferent
reader
will
be
arrested
by
the
opinions
boldly
promulgated
with
reference
to
species
the
evidence
that
all
animals
have
originated
in
large
numbers
is
growing
so
strong
that
the
idea
that
every
species
existed
in
the
beginning
in
single
pairs
may
be
said
to
be
given
up
almost
entirely
by
naturalists
if
we
are
led
to
admit
as
the
beginning
of
each
species
the
simultaneous
origin
of
a
large
number
of
individuals
if
the
same
species
may
originate
at
the
same
time
in
different
localities
these
first
representatives
of
each
species
at
least
were
not
connected
by
sexual
derivation
and
as
this
applies
equally
to
any
first
pair
this
fancied
test
criterion
of
specific
identity
must
at
all
events
be
given
up
and
with
it
goes
also
the
pretended
real
existence
of
the
species
in
contradistinction
from
the
mode
of
existence
of
genera
families
orders
classes
and
types
for
what
really
exists
are
individuals
not
species
pp
chapter
third
is
headed
notice
of
the
principal
systems
of
zoology
it
is
divided
into
the
six
following
sections
general
remarks
upon
modern
systems
early
attempts
to
classify
animals
period
of
linnaeus
period
of
cuvier
and
anatomical
systems
physiophilosophical

embryological
systems
this
chapter
is
invaluable
to
the
general
student
as
giving
him
in
a
single
view
not
only
a
of
the
most
important
attempts
at
classification
in
zoology
but
an
examination
of
the
principles
involved
in
each
by
the
one
among
all
living
men
most
fitted
to
perform
the
task
no
cultivated
person
who
desires
to
know
anything
of
natural
science
can
pass
over
this
portion
of
the
work
without
careful
study
those
who
are
not
prepared
to
follow
the
author
through
the
details
of
the
second
part
will
yet
consider
these
volumes
as
indispensable
companions
for
reference
as
containing
this
brief
but
comprehensive
encyclopedia
and
commentary
covering
the
whole
philosophical
machinery
of
zoological
science
for
the
first
section
of
this
chapter
agassiz
adopts
the
fundamental
divisions
branches
of
cuvier
introducing
such
changes
among
the
classes
and
orders
as
the
progress
of
science
demands
the
second
section
gives
a
short
account
of
the
early
attempts
to
classify
animals
more
particularly
of
the
divisions
established
by
aristotle
the
third
section
embraces
the
period
of
linnaeus
and
gives
his
classification
the
fourth
that
of
cuvier
and
anatomical
systems
with
the
classifications
of
cuvier
lamark
de
blainville
ehrenberg
burmeister
owen
von
siebold
and
stannius
leuckart
the
fifth
section
includes
the
physiophilosophical
systems
with
diagrams
of
oken
and
fitzinger
classifications
and
a
special
article
for
the
circular
groups
of
mcleay
the
sixth
and
last
section
is
devoted
to
embryological
systems

presents
diagrams
of
the

the
second
part
of
the
monograph
introduces
us
to
the
consideration
of
a
special
subject
of
natural
history
the
north
american
testudinata
its
three
chapters
treat
successively
of
this
order
of
reptiles
of
its
families
of
its
north
american
genera
and
species
the
third
part
contained
in
the
second
volume
is
entitled
embryology
of
the
turtle
it
consists
of
two
chapters
development
of
the
egg
from
its
first
appearance
to
the
formation
of
the
embryo
development
of
the
embryo
from
the
time
the
egg
leaves
the
ovary
to
that
of
the
hatching
of
the
young
then
follow
the
explanation
of
the
plates
and
the
plates
themselves
in
number
we
need
not
attempt
to
give
any
account
of
the
parts
devoted
to
the
development
of
these
particular
subjects
this
we
must
necessarily
leave
to
the
journals
devoted
to
scientific
matters
and
the
class
of
students
most
intimate
with
these
departments
of
natural
science
yet
the
american
who
asks
for
a
model
to
work
by
in
his
investigations
will
find
a
great
deal
more
than
the
north
american
testudinata
in
the
part
to
which
that
title
is
prefixed
the
principles
of
classification
exemplified
the
methods
of
description
illustrated
the
rules
of
nomenclature
tested
what
matter
is
it
whether
the
has
chosen
this
or
that
string
to
play
the
air
upon
when
each
has
compass
enough
for
all
its
melody
still
more
forcibly
does
this
comment
apply
to
the
elaborate
and
ample
division
of
the
work
embracing
the
embryology
of
the
turtle
he
who
has
mastered
the
details
of
this
section
has
at
his
feet
the
whole
broad
realm
of
which
this
province
holds
one
of
the
testudine
we
are
unwilling
to
speak
of
the
illustrations
comparatively
without
more
extended
means
of
judgment
than
we
have
at
hand
but
that
they
are
of
superlative
excellence
brilliant
delicate
accurate
and
is
what
none
will
dispute
look
at
these
turtles
models
of
owners
as
they
are

is
out
collecting

bodies
of
the
aforesaid
or
behold
no
plate
bewailing
the
wretchedness
of
those
who
have
no
roofs
to
cover
them
or
no
of
the
same
plate
bestowing
an
archiepiscopal
benediction
on
the
houseless
multitudes
before
he
retires
for
the
night
to
slumber
between
his
tessellated
floor
and
his
frescoed
ceiling
of
the
smooth
white
eggs
with
their
rounded
reliefs
and
tenderly
graduated
light
and
shadow
all
eyes
are
judges
but
of
the
exquisite
figures
showing
the
various
stages
of
development
and
the
details
of
structural
arrangement
the
uninitiated
must
take
the
opinions
of
a
microscopic
expert
and
if
they
will
accept
our
testimony
as
that
of
one
not
unfamiliar
with
the
instrument
and
the
mysteries
it
reveals
we
can
assure
them
that
these
figures
are
of
supreme
excellence
the
hazy
semitransparency
of
the
embryonic
tissues
the
halos
the
granules
the
globules
the
the
delicate
membranous
expansions
the
vascular
webs
are
expressed
with
purity
softness
freedom
and
a
conscientiousness
which
reminds
us
of
donne
microscopic
daguerreotypes
while
in
many
points
the
views
are
literally
truer
to
nature
just
as
a
sculptor
bust
of
a
living
person
is
often
more
really
like
him
in
character
than
a
cast
moulded
on
his
features
we
have
attempted
to
give
a
slight
idea
of
the
contents
of
these
two
volumes
in
the
compass
of
a
few
pages
we
have
called
the
attention
to
various
points
of
special
interest
as
we
were
going
along
it
remains
to
make
such
comments
as
suggest
themselves
to
us
either
in
our
character
of
the
scholiast
or
in
our
own
right
as
a
freed
citizen
of
the
intellectual
as
well
as
the
political
republic
whence
why
whither
these
are
the
three
great
questions
that
arise
in
the
soul
of
every
race
and
of
every
thinking
being
he
who
looks
at
either
of
them
with
the
least
new
light
though
he
whisper
what
he
sees
ever
so
softly
has
the
world
to
listen
to
him
no
matter
how
he
got
his
knowledge
nor
what
he
calls
it
it
belongs
to
mankind
but
science
has
been
mainly
engaged
with
another
question
in
itself
of
very
inferior
interest
namely
we
must
be
permitted
to
speak
of
science
in
our
freest
capacity
and
will
endeavor
not
to
abuse
our
liberty
the
study
of
natural
phenomena
for
the
sake
of
the
pleasing
variety
of
aspects
they
present
for
the
delight
of
collecting
curious
specimens
for
the
exercise
of
ingenuity
in
detecting
the
secret
methods
of
nature
for
the
gratification
of
arranging
facts
or
objects
in
regular
series
is
an
innocent
and
not
a
fruitless
pursuit
many
persons
are
born
with
a
natural
instinct
for
it
and
with
special
aptitudes
which
may
even
constitute
a
kind
of
genius
we
should
do
honor
to
such
power
wherever
we
find
it
honor
according
to
its
kind
and
its
degree
but
not
affix
the
wrong
label
to
it
those
who
possess
it
acquire
knowledge
sometimes
so
extensive
and
uncommon
that
we
regard
them
with
a
certain
admiration
but
knowledge
is
not
wisdom
unless
these
narrow
trains
of
ideas
are
brought
into
relation
with
other
and
wider
ranges
of
thought
or
with
the
conduct
of
life
they
can
not
aspire
to
that
loftier
name
we
must
go
farther
than
this
the
study
of
the
in
nature
or
the
simple
observation
of
phenomena
is
often
used
as
an
opiate
to
quiet
the
higher
faculties
there
can
be
no
question
of
the
fact
that
many
persons
pass
much
of
their
lives
working
in
the
or
laboratories
of
science
just
as
old
women
knit
just
as
prisoners
carve
quaintly
elaborate
toys
in
their
dungeons
the
product
is
not
absolutely
useless
in
either
case
the
fingers
of
the
body
or
of
the
mind
become
swift
and
cunning
but
the
soul
does
not
grow
under
such
culture
we
are
willing
to
allow
that
many
of
those
who
browse
in
the
sleepy
meadows
of
aimless
observation
loving
to
keep
their
heads
down
as
they
gaze
at
and
gather
their
narcotic
herbs
rather
than
lift
them
to
the
horizon
beyond
or
the
heaven
above
act
in
obedience
to
the
law
of
their
limited
natures
still
let
us
recognize
the
limitation
and
not
forget
that
the
pursuit
which
may
be
fitting
and
praiseworthy
toil
for
one
class
of
minds
may
be
ignoble
indolence
for
another
we
must
remember
on
the
other
hand
that
however
humble
may
be
the
intellectual
position
of
the
man
of
science
or
knowledge
in
distinction
from
wisdom
the
results
of
his
labors
may
be
of
the
highest
importance
the
most
ignorant
laborer
may
get
a
stone
out
of
the
quarry
and
the
poorest
slave
unearth
a
diamond
these
intellectual
artisans
come
to
their
daily
task
with
hypertrophied
special
organs
fitted
to
their
peculiar
craft
some
of
them
are
all
eyes
some
all
hands
some
are
microscopes
others
balances
if
a
man
would
watch
a
thermometer
every
hour
of
the
day
and
night
for
ten
years
and
give
a
table
of
his
observations
the
result
would
be
of
interest
and
value
but
the
bulbous
extremity
of
the
instrument
would
probably
contain
as
much
thought
at
the
end
of
the
ten
years
as
that
of
the
observer
clearly
then
science
does
not
properly
belong
to
scientific
men
unless
they
happen
also
to
be
wise
ones
not
more
to
them
than
honey
to
bees
or
books
to
printers
the
bee
certainly
feed
on
the
honey
he
has
made
and
the
printer
read
the
books
he
has
put
in
type
but
non
is
the
rule
science
is
knowledge
it
is
true
but
knowledge
disarticulated
and
parcelled
out
among
certain
specialists
like
truth
in
milton
glorious
comparison
he
who
can
restore
each
part
to
its
true
position
and
orient
the
lesser
whole
in
its
relations
to
the
universe
he
it
is
to
whom
science
belongs
he
must
range
through
all
time
and
follow
nature
to
her
farthest
bounds
then
he
can
dissect
beetles
like
straus
derekheim
without
becoming
a
myope
but
even
this
is
not
enough
let
us
see
what
qualities
would
go
to
make
up
the
ideal
model
of
the
truly
wise
student
of
nature
he
must
have
in
the
first
place
as
the
substratum
of
his
faculties
the
power
of
observation
with
the
passion
that
keeps
it
active
and
the
skilful
hand
to
serve
its
needs
secondly
a
quick
eye
for
resemblances
and
differences
thirdly
a
wide
range
of
mental
vision
fourthly
the
coordinating
or
systematizing
faculty
fifthly
a
large
scholarship
lastly
and
without
which
all
these
gifts
fall
short
of
their
ultimate
aim
an
instinct
for
the
highest
forms
of
truth
a
centripetal
tendency
always
seeking
the
idea
behind
the
form
the
deity
in
his
manifestations
and
thence
working
outward
again
to
solve
those
infinite
problems
of
life
and
its
destinies
which
are
in
reality
all
that
the
thinking
soul
most
lives
for
it
is
as
easy
to
find
all
these
qualities
separate
as
it
is
to
turn
beneath
the
finger
one
of
the
letters
of
a
revolving
padlock
but
they
must
all
be
brought
together
in
line
before
the
grand
portals
of
nature
hypaethral
temple
will
open
to
her
chosen
student
how
incomplete
the
man
of
science
is
with
only
one
or
two
of
these
endowments
may
be
seen
by
a
few
examples
the
power
and
instinct
of
observation
combined
with
the
most
consummate
skill
do
not
necessarily
make
a
great
philosophical
naturalist
leeuwenhoek
had
all
these
they
bore
admirable
fruits
too
we
can
not
but
read
the
old
man
letters
to
the
royal
society
written
if
we
remember
right
after
the
age
of
eighty
with
delight
and
admiration
those
little
lenses
in
their
silver
mountings
all
ground
and
set
and
fashioned
by
his
own
hand
showed
him
the
and
the
pipes
of
the
teeth
which
purkinje
and
retzius
found
with
their
achromatic
microscopes
a
century
later
we
honor
his
skill
and
sagacity
as
they
deserve
but
a
little
trick
of
dollond
applied
to
the
microscopic
has
left
all
his
achievements
a
mere
matter
of
curious
history
few
have
been
more
remarkable
for
perceiving
resemblances
and
differences
than
oken
this
is
the
poetical
side
of
the
scientific
mind
and
he
shares
with
goethe
the
honor
of
that
startling
and
discovery
the
vertebral
character
of
the
bones
of
the
cranium
at
this
very
time
the
four
vertebral
cranial
bones
recognized
by
owen
are
the
same
oken
has
described
but
notwithstanding
the
generous
tribute
of
agassiz
to
his
great
merits
the
writer
who
assigns
special
colors
to
the
persons
in
the
trinity
red
blue
and
green
and
then
allots
to
satan
a
constituent
of
one
of
these
yellow
has
drifted
away
from
the
solid
anchorage
of
observation
into
the
shoreless
waste
of
the
inane
if
not
amidst
the
dark
abysses
of
the
profane
if
the
widest
range
of
mental
vision
joined
too
with
great
learning
could
make
a
successful
student
of
nature
lord
bacon
should
have
stood
by
the
side
of
linnaeus
but
open
the
sylva
sylvarum
anywhere
and
see
what
bacon
was
as
a
naturalist
it
was
observed
in
the
of
the
last
yeare
that
there
were
scene
in
divers
and
low
about
many
that
had
two
or
three
inches
long
at
the
least
whereas
usually
have
no
tailes
at
all
which
argueth
a
great
disposition
to
in
the
and
this
in
that
great
birth
of
time
the
instauration
of
the
sciences
the
systematizing
or
coordinating
power
is
worse
than
nothing
unless
it
be
supported
by
the
other
qualities
already
mentioned
darwin
had
it
and
something
of
what
is
called
genius
with
it
but
where
is
now
the
zoönomia
and
what
is
erudition
without
the
power
to
correct
errors
by
appealing
to
nature
to
arrange
methodically
to
use
wisely
it
would
be
a
shame
to
mention
any
name
in
illustration
of
its
insignificance
our
shelves
bend
and
crack
under
the
load
of
unwise
and
learned
authorship
there
are
two
stages
in
every
student
life
in
the
first
he
is
afraid
of
books
in
the
second
books
are
afraid
of
him
for
they
are
a
great
community
of
thieves
and
one
finds
the
same
stolen
patterns
in
all
their
pockets
though
often
dressed
in
sheep
clothing
they
have
the
maw
of
wolves
when
the
student
has
once
found
them
out
he
laughs
at
the
pretensions
of
erudition
and
strides
gayly
up
and
down
great
libraries
feeling
that
the
most
blustering
folio
of
them
all
will
turn
as
pale
as
if
it
were
bound
in
if
he
only
lay
his
hand
on
its
shoulder
nor
lastly
can
any
elevation
of
aim
any
thirst
for
the
divine
springs
of
knowledge
enable
a
man
to
dispense
with
the
sober
habits
of
observation
and
the
positive
acquirements
that
must
give
him
the
stamina
to
attempt
the
higher
flights
of
thought
the
eagle
wings
are
nothing
without
his
pectoral
muscles
it
is
not
swedenborg
and
his
disciples
that
legislate
for
the
scientific
world
they
may
suggest
truth
but
they
rarely
prove
it
and
never
bring
it
into
such
systematic
forms
as
nature
will
insist
on
laying
down
that
all
these
qualities
which
go
to
make
up
our
ideal
should
exist
in
absolute
perfection
in
any
single
man
of
mortal
birth
is
not
to
be
expected
but
there
are
names
in
the
history
of
science
which
recall
so
imposing
a
combination
of
these
several
gifts
that
comparing
the
men
who
bore
them
with
the
civilization
of
their
time
we
can
hardly
conceive
that
uninspired
intellect
should
come
nearer
the
imaginary
standard
such
a
man
was
aristotle
the
slender
and
fop
with
the
showy
mantle
on
his
ungraceful
person
and
the
costly
rings
on
his
fingers
who
hung
on
the
lips
of
plato
for
twenty
years
and
trained
the
boy
of
macedon
to
whatever
wisdom
he
possessed
whose
life
was
set
by
destiny
between
the
greatest
of
thinkers
and
the
greatest
of
conquerors
seems
to
have
borrowed
the
intellect
of
the
one
and
the
universal
aspirations
of
the
other
but
because
he
invaded
every
realm
of
knowledge
it
must
not
be
thought
he
dealt
with
nature
at
he
was
a
collector
and
a
dissector
he
could
display
the
anatomical
structure
of
a
fish
as
well
as
write
a
treatise
on
the
universe
or
on
rhetoric
or
government
or
logic
or
music
or
mathematics
dethroned
we
call
him
and
yet
agassiz
quotes
his
descriptions
with
respect
and
confesses
that
the
systematic
classification
of
animals
makes
but
one
stride
from
aristotle
to
linnaeus
cuvier
was
such
a
man
alone
and
unapproached
in
his
own
spheres
of
knowledge
his
report
on
the
progress
of
the
natural
sciences
is
only
an
index
to
the
wide
range
of
his
intellect
in
one
point
however
we
must
own
that
he
seems
slow
of
apprehension
or
limited
by
preconceived
opinions
in
his
reception
of
the
homologies
pointed
out
by
oken
and
the
physiophilosophical
observers
in
the
same
range
of
intellects
we
should
reckon
linnaeus
and
humboldt
and
should
have
reckoned
goethe
had
he
given
himself
to
science
we
do
not
assume
to
say
where
in
the
category
of
fully
equipped
intelligences
agassiz
belongs
but
if
the
union
of
the
most
extraordinary
observing
powers
with
an
almost
poetic
perception
of
analogies
with
a
wide
compass
of
thought
the
classifying
instinct
and
habit
large
knowledge
of
books
and
personal
intimacy
with
the
leaders
in
various
departments
of
knowledge
and
with
this
the
aspect
of
mind
and
heart
which
is
the
crowning
gift
of
all
if
the
union
of
these
qualities
can
give
to
the
man
of
science
a
claim
to
the
nobler
name
of
wisdom
it
is
not
flattery
but
justice
to
award
this
distinction
to
agassiz
to
him
then
we
listen
when
after
having
sounded
every
note
in
the
wide
gamut
of
nature
after
reading
the
story
of
life
as
it
stands
written
in
the
long
series
of
records
reaching
from
cambrian
fossils
to
ovarian
germs
after
tracing
the
divine
principle
of
order
from
the
starlike
flower
at
his
feet
to
the
circle
of
planets
which
spreads
its
fiery
corolla
in
obedience
to
the
same
simple
law
that
disposes
the
leaves
of
the
growing
plant
as
our
eminent
mathematician
tells
us
he
relates
in
simple
and
reverential
accents
the
highest
truths
he
has
learned
in
traversing
god
mighty
universe
for
him
and
such
as
him
for
us
too
if
we
read
wisely
the
toiling
slaves
of
science
often
working
with
little
consciousness
of
the
full
proportions
of
the
edifice
they
are
helping
to
construct
have
spent
their
busy
lives
all
knowledge
asserts
its
true
dignity
when
once
brought
into
relation
with
the
grand
end
of
knowledge
a
wider
and
deeper
view
of
the
significance
of
conscious
and
unconscious
created
being
and
the
character
of
its
creator
we
shall
close
this
article
with
some
remarks
upon
the
great
doctrines
that
dominate
all
the
manifold
subordinate
thoughts
which
fill
these
crowded
pages
the
plan
of
creation
agassiz
maintains
has
not
grown
out
of
the
necessary
action
of
physical
laws
but
was
the
free
conception
of
the
almighty
intellect
matured
in
his
thought
before
it
was
manifested
in
tangible
external
forms
before
agassiz
before
linnaeus
before
aristotle
before
plato
timaeus
the
locrian
spake

original

so
taught
the
pagan
philosopher
whom
plato
took
as
his
guide
in
his
contemplations
of
nature
we
trace
the
thought
again
in
dante
amidst
the
various
fragments
of
ancient
wisdom
which
he
has
embodied
in
the
divina
commedia

che
non

che

non

sire
xiii
two
thousand
years
after
the
old
greek
had
written
the
christian
philosopher
sir
thomas
browne
repeats
the
same
doctrine
in
a
new
phraseology
abraham
was
i
is
the
saying
of
christ
yet
it
is
true
in
some
sense
if
i
say
it
of
myself
for
i
was
not
only
before
myself
but
that
is
in
the
idea
of
god
and
the
decree
of
that
synod
held
from
all
eternity
and
in
this
sense
i
say
the
world
was
before
the
creation
and
at
an
end
before
it
had
a
beginning
and
thus
was
i
dead
before
i
was
alive
though
my
grave
be
my
dying
place
was
paradise
and
eve
miscarried
of
me
before
she
conceived
of
cain
the
slender
reed
through
which
philosophy
breathed
her
first
musical
whisperings
is
laid
by
and
the
sacred
lyre
of
theology
is
silent
or
little
heeded
but
the
mighty
organ
of
modern
science
with
its
hundred
stops
each
answering
to
some
voice
of
nature
takes
up
the
pausing
strain
and
as
we
listen
we
recognize
through
all
its
mingling
harmonies
the
simple
sublime
eternal
melody
that
came
from
the
lips
of
timaeus
the
locrian
the
same
doctrine
reappears
in
various
forms
in
the
popular
works
of
derham
and
paloy
and
the
bridgewater
treatises
in
the
learned
and
thoughtful
pages
of
burdach
and
in
the
mystical
rhapsodies
of
oken
but
never
we
believe
was
it
before
enforced
and
illustrated
by
so
imperial
a
survey
of
the
whole
domain
of
natural
science
as
in
the
volumes
before
us
we
are
not
disposed
to
discuss
at
any
length
the
opinion
maintained
by
agassiz
that
life
has
not
grown
out
of
the
necessary
action
of
the
physical
laws
if
we
accept
the
customary
definitions
of
the
physical
laws
we
accede
most
cordially
to
his
proposition
as
opposed
to
the
fancies
of
epicurus
and
his
poet
lucretius
or
to
modern
atheistic
doctrines
of
similar
character
we
have
no
qualification
or
condition
to
suggest
which
might
change
its
force
or
significance
when
we
remember
that
the
genius
of
such
a
man
as
laplace
shared
the
farthest
flight
of
science
only
to
waft
us
back
the
tidings
of
despair
we
are
thankful
that
so
profound
a
student
of
nature
as
agassiz
has
tracked
the
warm
of
divinity
throughout
all
the
vestiges
of
creation
there
is
danger
however
that
in
accepting
this
doctrine
as
a
truth
we
may
be
led
into
an
inexact
conception
of
the
physical
laws
unless
we
closely
examine
the
sense
in
which
we
use
the
expression
the
forces
which
act
according
to
these
laws
and
the
various
forms
of
the
or
concrete
forces
are
often
spoken
of
as
if
they
were
blind
agencies
and
existences
acting
by
an
inherent
power
of
their
own
but
if
everything
outside
of
our
consciousness
resolves
itself
in
the
last
analysis
into
force
or
something
capable
of
producing
change
and
if
force
existing
by
the
will
of
an
omniscient
and
omnipresent
being
to
whom
time
has
no
absolute
significance
is
simply
god
himself
in
action
then
we
shall
find
it
impossible
to
limit
the
causal
agency
of
the
physical
forces
all
we
can
say
is
that
commonly
they
appear
to
move
in
certain
rectilinear
paths
in
which
they
manifest
a
degree
of
uniformity
and
precision
so
amazing
that
we
are
lost
in
the
infinite
intelligence
they
display
unless
we
become
perfectly
stupid
to
it
and
think
as
in
the
old
fable
there
is
no
music
in
it
because
we
are
made
deaf
by
its
continued
harmony
no
single
leaf
ever
made
a
mistake
in
falling
though
in
so
doing
it
solved
more
problems
than
were
ever
held
in
all
the
libraries
that
have
changed
or
are
changing
into
dust
or
ashes
we
are
willing
to
accept
the
belief
of
agassiz
that
matter
does
not
exist
as
such
but
is
everywhere
and
always
a
specific
thing
as
are
all
finite
beings
but
we
must
extend
the
same
idea
to
the
physical
forces
and
believe
them
to
be
specific
agencies
and
their
acts
specific
acts
in
other
words
each
one
of
them
a
divine
manifestation
theology
is
close
upon
us
in
these
speculations
perhaps
says
robertson
in
the
volume
of
admirable
sermons
just
republished
even
the
eternal
himself
is
more
closely
bound
to
his
works
than
our
philosophical
systems
have
conceived
perhaps
matter
is
only
a
mode
of
thought
looking
then
at
our
recognized
forms
of
matter
and
physical
force
as
expressions
of
a
omnipotence
we
concede
that
the
uniform
lines
of
action
in
which
human
observation
has
hitherto
traced
them
do
not
and
so
far
as
we
can
see
can
not
shape
the
curves
of
the
simplest
organism
it
is
time
for
us
to
close
these
volumes
to
which
we
can
not
even
hope
to
have
done
justice
and
leave
them
to
those
graver
tribunals
that
will
in
due
season
award
their
decisions
we
have
taken
the
master
hand
and
followed
nature
through
all
her
paths
of
life
we
have
trod
with
him
the
shores
of
old
oceans
that
roll
no
more
and
traced
the
providence
that
orders
the
creation
of
engraved
in
every
stony
feature
of
their
obsolete
organisms
we
have
broken
into
that
mysterious
chamber
the
chosen
studio
of
the
infinite
artist
where
beneath
its
marble
or
crystalline
dome
he
fashions
the
embryo
from
its
formless
fluids
and
as
we
turn
reluctantly
away
the
accents
we
have
once
already
heard
linger
with
us
in
one
word
all
these
facts
in
their
natural
connection
proclaim
aloud
the
one
god
whom
man
may
know
adore
and
love
and
natural
history
must
in
good
time
become
the
analysis
of
the
thoughts
of
the
creator
of
the
universe

and

all

the
shadows
of

hither

passing
throngs

straight
across

way

parsee
over
against
me
to
the
gate
of

house

my
is
i
watch
with
interest
the
frequent
eddies
occasioned

of

brahmin
warrior

keeping
severely
to

side

that
the
foul
shadow

not
pollute

is
as
though
my
window
were
a
tower
of
allahabad
and
below
me
in
cossitollah
were
the
shy
meeting
of
the
waters

looking
up

down
i
mark
how
the
limpid
jumna
of

caste
holds
its
way

you
ever
do
the
city

permit
me
to
commend
with
especial
emphasis
to
your
consideration
this
same
cossitollah
as
a
representative
street
wherein
the
european
and
asiatic
elements
of
the
calcutta
panorama
are
mingled
in
the
most
picturesque
proportions
for
cossitollah
is
the
link
that
most
directly
joins
the
pitiful
benightedness
of
the
black
town
to
the
imposing
splendors
of
kumpnee
bahadoor
the
short
but
stubborn
chain
of
responsibility
as
it
were
whereby
the
ball
of
helpless
and
infatuated
is
fastened
to
the
leg
of
british
enlightenment
and
accountability
from
the
midaun
or
parade
ground
with
its
arrays
of
sepoy
chivalry
its
grand
reviews
before
the
lard
as
in
domestic
bengalee
we
designate
the
its
solemn
sham
battles
and
its
regimental

cossitollah
is
as
i
have
said
preëminently
the

street

calcutta
other

all

here
the

gives
the

walks
carefully

reader

the

let
us
sit

observe
it

forty
puffs
of
a
no

in
a
lazy
palanquin
from
one
end
of
cossitollah
to
the
other
and
from
our
window
though
not
exactly
midway
but
nearer
the
bazaar
we
can
see
from
flag
street
wellnigh
to
the
midaun
what
is
this
a
close
with
a
passenger
the
bearers
with
elbows
sharply
crooked
and

all
varicose
trotting
to
a
monotonous
jerking
ditty
which
the

is
impudently
improvising
to
the
refrain
of
easy

at
the
expense
of
their

sufficiently

a

through

so
they
have
turned
down

but
what
now
here
is
something
more
imposing
a
four
spanking
arabs
in
trappings
a
fat
and
elaborate
coachman
very
solemn
two
tall
or
supporting
the
box
one
on

with
studied
symmetry
like
siva

vishnu
upholding
the

thus
amid
much
vociferation
and
unceremonious
dispersing
of
the
common
herd
who
dodge
with
practised
agility
right
and
left
the
fat
and
elaborate
coachman
pulls
up
the
spanking
arabs
at
our
gate
and
the
baboo
alights
with
the
air
of
a
gentleman
of
thirty
lachs
to
the
manner
born
to
him
all
this
outcry
is
but
usage
custom
and
is
to
him
as
air
as
the
baboo
steps
through
the
wide
swinging
gate
and
enters
the
place
that
owns
him
master
let
us
mark
his
reception
the
first
our
grenadier
doorkeeper
the
man
of
proud
port
and
commanding
presence
to
whom
that
portal
is
a
post
of
honor
our
athos
porthos
and
aramis
in
one
of
courage
strength
and
address
enlisted
with
fidelity
the
loyalty
of
ramee
durwan
is
threefold
in
this
order
first
to
his
caste
next
to
his
beard
and
then
to
his
post
only
for
the
two
first
would
he
abandon
the
last
his
life
he
holds
of
less
account
than
either
as
the
baboo
passes
ramee
durwan
you
think
will
be
ready
with
profound
and
obsequious
salaam
not
so
he
draws
himself
up
to
the
very
last
of
his
extraordinary
inches
and
touches
his
forehead
lightly
with
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
only
slightly
inclining
his
head
a
not
more
than
affable
salute
almost
with
a
quality
of
concession
gracious
as
well
as
graceful
he
would
do
as
much
for
any
puppy
of
a
cadet
who
might
drop
in
on
the
sahib
on
the
other
hand
lowly
louteth
the
baboo
with
eyes
downcast
and
palm
applied
reverentially
to
his
sleek
forehead
how
now
this
baboo
is
a
banyan
of
solid
substance
and
the
mullicks
all
are
citizens
of
credit
and
renown
while
ramee
durwan
gets
five
rupees
a
month
and
makes
his
bed
at
the
gate
last
year
they
say
when
little
dwarkanath
mullick
the
baboo
adopted
son
nine
years
old
was
married
to
the
tender
child
vinda
old
lulla
seal
darling
on
her
fifth
birthday
the
baboo
kalidas
raniaya
mullick
made
the
occasion
famous
by
liberating
fifty
of
the
soodra
sort
with
as
many
flourishes
of
his
illustrious
signature
ramee
durwan
has
not
a
change
of
turbans
and
now
the
baboo
passes
into
the
godown
and
receives
from
a
score
of
servile
glibbest
of
clerks
their
several
reports
of
the
day
business
presently
from
his
low
desk
in
the
lowliest
corner
uprises
and
comes
forward
quietly
mutty

roy
the

every

but
he
is
only
the
baboo

circar
an
humble
accountant
on
fifteen
rupees
a
month
do
you
perceive
that
fact
in
the
style
of
his
salutation
hardly
for
the
baboo
piously
raises
his
joined
hands
high
above
his
head
and
louting
lower
than
before
murmurs
the
orthodox
salutation
yet
the
baboo
contributed
two
thousand
rupees
in
fireworks
to
the
last
doorga
fooja
and
sent
a
hundred
goats
to
the
altar
while
only
with
many
and
trying
shifts
of
saving
could
mutty
loll
afford
gold
leaf
for
one
image
besides
two
tomtoms
and
a
horn
to
march
before
it
in
procession
but
behold
the
lordly
beneficence
in
mutty
loll
attitude
and
gesture
as
with
outstretched
hands
palms
upward
he
greets
the
baboo
condescendingly

here
comes
the

to

for

whither
so
fast
with
the
spanking

and
the

to
the
to
the

and
the
simpkin
is
for

of
mine
who
will
do
the
the
honor
to
make
it
their
own
for
a
day
or
two
take
care
baboo
take
care
i
have
my
doubts
as
to
the
simpkin
they
do
say
the
orthodoxy
of
bengal
men
is
none
the
better
for
beefsteaks
and
heidseck
such
diet
does
not
become
the
son
of
a
strict
and
straightgoing
heathen
well
may
the
brahmins
groan
for
the
glaring
scandals
of
the
new
lights
you
be
marrying
widows
next
and
dining
at
clubs
with
fast
ensigns
sahib
caste
is
god
and
mamoul
is
his
prophet
the
church
of
the
churruck
post
and
the
orgies
of
hooly
are
in
no
danger
from
beef
or
simpkin
so
long
as
steak
or
bottle
costs
a
man
his
inheritance
and
we
of
young
bengal
know
too
well
how
hard
are
the
ways
of
the
pariah
to
try
them
for
fun
caste
is
god
and
mamoul
is
his
prophet
the
tidings
of
great
joy
your
missionaries
bring
fall
upon
ears
stopped
with
family
pride
and
the
family
jewels
you
know
that
appropriate
old

in
our
proverbial
philosophy
is
the
news
of
the

to
a

in

well
i
have
but
a
few
minutes
to
spare
and
the

is
waiting
with
the
indigo
samples
presently
as
the
cossitollah
panorama
flows
on
beneath
our
window
with
all
its
bizarreness
from
the
bazaars
its
boxwallahs
and
its
its
peddlers
of

its

its

and
its
perambulating
cobblers
and

its
jugglers
gymnasts
and
its
fellows
who
feed
on
glass
bottles
for
the
astonishment
and
delectation
of
the
sahibs
or
who
if
you
have
such
a
thing
as
a
sheep
about
you
will
undertake
to
slaughter
and
skin
it
with
their
teeth
and
devour
it
on
the

its

for
a
few
pice
will
run
sharp
foils
through
each
other
bodies
without
for
a
moment
disturbing
either
health
or
cheerfulness
or
will
make
mangoes
grow
under

while
master
waits
as
the
brahmin
still
dodges
the
shadow
of
the
soodra
and
the
soodra
spits
upon
the
footprint
of
the

the
baboo
returns
to
his

the

solemn
coachman
gathers
up
the

the

assume
their

attitudes
on

the

just
now
a

with

one

and
never

near
passes
the

the
plain

of
a
respectable
accountant
in
the
honorable
company
coal
office
at
garden
reach
shows
between
the
venetian
slats
of
the
little
window
and
lo
our
fine
baboo
steps
out
of
his
slippers
and
standing
barefoot
in
the
common
dust
of
cossitollah
dust
that
has
been
churned
by
all
the
that
ply
that
promiscuous
thoroughfare
humbly
touches
first
the
vulgar
ground
and
then
his
elegant
turban
murmuring
a
pious
for
the
respectable
accountant
in
the
honorable
company
coal
office
is
like
mutty
loll
a
kooleen
brahmin
only
a
little
more
so
caste
is
god
and
mamoul
is
his
prophet
at
the
of
the
baboo
on
the
durumtollah
road
a
gray
and
withered
hag
all
crippled
and
leprosied
sits
what
may
that
be
be
patient
you
shall
know
when
the
baboo
was
as
yet
a
youth
his
uncle
rajinda
the
pride
of
the
mullicks
died
of
cholera
and
the
administration
of
the
estate
devolved
upon
our
kalidas
of
course
there
were
mortgages
to
foreclose
and
delinquent
debtors
to
stir
up
a
certain
small
shopkeeper
of
the
china
bazaar
was
responsible
to
the
concern
for
a
few
thousand
rupees
wherewith
he
had
been
accommodated
by
uncle
rajinda
as
a
basis
for
certain
operations
in
seersuckers
and
that
had
yielded
no
returns
so
our
baboo
in
a
curt
that
is
note
or
of
paper
as
near
as
a
bengalee
can
come
to
the
word
bade
the
small
speculator
of
china
bazaar
come
down
forthwith
with
the
rupees
but
behold
you
now
he
had
paid
he
said
by
the
holy
ganges
and
the
blessed
cow
by
the
turban
of
his
father
and
the
veil
of
his
mother
restitution
had
been
made
long
ago
the
old
man
said
and
the
soul
of
uncle
rajinda
the
pride
of
the
mullicks
had
no
reason
to
be
disquieted
for
the
rupees
though
the
seersuckers
had
been
but
vanity
and
the
vexation
of
spirit
produce
the
documents
said
the
baboo
with
a
impassibility
that
in
wall
street
would
have
made
him
a
great
bear
where
are
the
receipts
my
lord
i
know
not
prostrating
my
unworthy
turban
beneath
the
lovely
lilies
of
your
feet
i
swear
to
my
the
lord
by
the
holy
water
and
the
blessed
cow
by
the
beard
of
my
father
and
the
veil
of
my
mother
that
i
settled
the
little
account
long
ago
that
unhappy
speculator
in
seersuckers
and
died
in
prison
and
a
that
is
a
spiritual
teacher
feed
by
the
baboo
desolated
his
last
hour
with
the
assurance
that
he
should
transmigrate
into
the
bodies
of
seven
generations
of
and
drag
sailormen
in
a
state
of
beer
from
the
ghauts
to
the
all
his
miserable
lives
now
whether
or
not
the
unlucky
little
speculator
had
in
good
faith
discharged
the
debt
will
in
all
the
probabilities
of
human
rights
and
wrongs
never
appear
this
side
of
the
last
trump
for
the
holy
water
and
the
sacred
cow
his
father
beard
and
his
mother
veil
were
not
good
in
law
the
documents
not
forthcoming
but
it
is
certain
that
his
widow
had
faith
in
his
integrity
for
at
once
with
all
her
sorrows
on
her
head
she
sallied
forth
in
quest
of
justice
and
from
brahmin
post
to
sahib
pillar
she
went
crying
see
me
righted
against
this
hard
and
arrogant
baboo
let
my
wrongs
be
redressed
or
fear
the
evil
eye
of
dookhee
the
sorrowful
of
haranu
the
lost
but
utterly
in
vain
for
the
clamor
of
the
hindoo
widow
however
bitterly
aggrieved
is
but
a
nuisance
and
her
accusation
insolence
so
in
her
pitiful
outcasting
in
all
the
forlorn
loathsomeness
of
leprosy
and
the
shunned
squalor
of
a
cripple
she
sat
down
at
the
baboo
gate
to
wait
for
justice
till
the
gods
should
bestow
it
till
siva
the
avenger
should
behold
her
and
ask
who
has
done
this
and
who
shall
challenge
her
who
shall
bid
her
move
on
mamoul
has
crowned
her
queen
of
tears
and
her
sublime
patience
and
appealing
have
made
a
throne
of
the
wayside
stone
on
which
she
sits
there
is
no
power
so
audacious
that
it
would
give
the
word
to
depose
her
her
matted
gray
locks
and
her
furrowed
cheeks
her
sunken
eyes
and
her
hungry
lips
are
her
sacred
ashes
of
the
high
caste
of
sorrow
the
brahmin
averts
his
face
as
he
passes
and
mutters
she
is
as
the
flower
which
is
out
of
reach
she
is
dedicated
to
god
that
insolent
official
the
baboo
pampered
durwan
sees
in
her
only
mamoul
he
would
as
soon
think
of
shaving
himself
as
of
driving
her
away
so
as
the
baboo
passes
in
or
out
through
the
great
gate
the
solemn
coachman
whips
up
the
spanking
arabs
and
the
syces
bawl
louder
than
ever
and
kalidas
ramaya
mullick
turns
away
his
eyes
but
for
all
that
the
durhna
woman
heaps
dust
upon
her
head
which
he
sees
and
mutters
a
weird
warning
which
he
hears
and
though
the
lawn
is
wide
and
the
banian
topes
are
leafy
and
a
gilded
temple
the
family
shrine
stands
between
and
the
marble
veranda
is
spacious
and
the
state
apartments
are
remote
they
do
say
the
shadow
of
the
durhna
woman
falls
on
the

after

the

we
leave

learn
as
i
did
without

of
a
surly
that
in

parlors
they
estimate
all

of
this
kind
as
rubbish

it
is
not

true
that
there

are
of

which
take
rank
in

with

passionate
experiences
so
medicinal
so
stringent
so
revolutionary
so
authoritative
books
which
are
the
work
and
the
proof
of
faculties
so
comprehensive
so
nearly
equal
to
the
world
which
they
paint
that
though
one
shuts
them
with
meaner
ones
he
feels
his
exclusion
from
them
to
accuse
his
way
of
living
consider
what
you
have
in
the
smallest
chosen
library
a
company
of
the
wisest
and
wittiest
men
that
could
be
picked
out
of
all
civil
countries
in
a
thousand
years
have
set
in
best
order
the
results
of
their
learning
and
wisdom
the
men
themselves
were
hid
and
inaccessible
solitary
impatient
of
interruption
fenced
by
etiquette
but
the
thought
which
they
did
not
uncover
to
their
bosom
friend
is
here
written
out
in
transparent
words
to
us
the
strangers
of
another
age
we
owe
to
books
those
general
benefits
which
come
from
high
intellectual
action
thus
i
think
we
often
owe
to
them
the
perception
of
immortality
they
impart
sympathetic
activity
to
the
moral
power
go
with
mean
people
and
you
think
life
is
mean
then
read
plutarch
and
the
world
is
a
proud
place
peopled
with
men
of
positive
quality
with
heroes
and
demigods
standing
around
us
who
will
not

sleep
then
they
address

poetry
inspires

become
the
organic
culture
of
the
time
college
education
is
the
reading
of
certain
books
which
the
common
sense
of
all
scholars
agrees
will
represent
the
science
already
accumulated
if
you
know
that
for
instance
in
geometry
if
you
have
read
euclid
and
laplace
your
opinion
has
some
value
if
you
do
not
know
these
you
are
not
entitled
to
give
any
opinion
on
the
subject
whenever
any
skeptic
or
bigot
claims
to
be
heard
on
the
questions
of
intellect
and
morals
we
ask
if
he
is
familiar
with
the
books
of
plato
where
all
his
pert
objections
have
once
for
all
been
disposed
of
if
not
he
has
no
right
to
our
time
let
him
go
and
find
himself
answered
there
meantime
the
colleges
whilst
they
provide
us
with
libraries
furnish
no
professor
of
books
and
i
think
no
chair
is
so
much
wanted
in
a
library
we
are
surrounded
by
many
hundreds
of
dear
friends
but
they
are
imprisoned
by
an
enchanter
in
these
paper
and
leathern
boxes
and
though
they
know
us
and
have
been
waiting
two
ten
or
twenty
centuries
for
us
some
of
them
and
are
eager
to
give
us
a
sign
and
unbosom
themselves
it
is
the
law
of
their
limbo
that
they
must
not
speak
until
spoken
to
and
as
the
enchanter
has
dressed
them
like
battalions
of
infantry
in
coat
and
jacket
of
one
cut
by
the
thousand
and
ten
thousand
your
chance
of
hitting
on
the
right
one
is
to
be
computed
by
the
arithmetical
rule
of
permutation
and
combination
not
a
choice
out
of
three
caskets
but
out
of
half
a
million
caskets
all
alike
but
it
happens
in
our
experience
that
in
this
lottery
there
are
at
least
fifty
or
a
hundred
blanks
to
a
prize
it
seems
then
as
if
some
charitable
soul
after
losing
a
great
deal
of
time
among
the
false
books
and
alighting
upon
a
few
true
ones
which
made
him
happy
and
wise
would
do
a
right
act
in
naming
those
which
have
been
bridges
or
ships
to
carry
him
safely
over
dark
morasses
and
barren
oceans
into
the
heart
of
sacred
cities
into
palaces
and
temples
this
would
be
best
done
by
those
great
masters
of
books
who
from
time
to
time
appear
the
fabricii
the
seldens
magliabecchis
scaligers
mirandolas
bayles
johnsons
whose
eyes
sweep
the
whole
horizon
of
learning
but
private
readers
reading
purely
for
love
of
the
book
would
serve
us
by
leaving
each
the
shortest
note
of
what
he
found
there
are
books
and
it
is
practicable
to
read
them
because
they
are
so
few
we
look
over
with
a
sigh
the
monumental
libraries
of
paris
of
the
vatican
and
the
british
museum
in
the
imperial
library
at
paris
it
is
commonly
said
there
are
six
hundred
thousand
volumes
and
nearly
as
many
manuscripts
and
perhaps
the
number
of
extant
printed
books
may
be
as
many
as
these
numbers
united
or
exceeding
a
million
it
is
easy
to
count
the
number
of
pages
which
a
diligent
man
can
read
in
a
day
and
the
number
of
years
which
human
life
in
favorable
circumstances
allows
to
reading
and
to
demonstrate
that
though
he
should
read
from
dawn
till
dark
for
sixty
years
he
must
die
in
the
first
alcoves
but
nothing
can
be
more
deceptive
than
this
arithmetic
where
none
but
a
natural
method
is
really
pertinent
i
visit
occasionally
the
cambridge
library
and
i
can
seldom
go
there
without
renewing
the
conviction
that
the
best
of
it
all
is
already
within
the
four
walls
of
my
study
at
home
the
inspection
of
the
catalogue
brings
me
continually
back
to
the
few
standard
writers
who
are
on
every
private
shelf
and
to
these
it
can
afford
only
the
most
slight
and
casual
additions
the
crowds
and
centuries
of
books
are
only
commentary
and
elucidation
echoes
and
weakeners
of
these
few
great
voices
of
time
the
best
rule
of
reading
will
be
a
method
from
nature
and
not
a
mechanical
one
of
hours
and
pages
it
holds
each
student
to
a
pursuit
of
his
native
aim
instead
of
a
desultory
miscellany
let
him
read
what
is
proper
to
him
and
not
waste
his
memory
on
a
crowd
of
mediocrities
as
whole
nations
have
derived
their
culture
from
a
single
book
as
the
bible
has
been
the
literature
as
well
as
the
religion
of
large
portions
of
europe
as
hafiz
was
the
eminent
genius
of
the
persians
confucius
of
the
chinese
cervantes
of
the
spaniards
so
perhaps
the
human
mind
would
be
a
gainer
if
all
the
secondary
writers
were
lost
say
in
england
all
but
shakspeare
milton
and
bacon
through
the
profounder
study
so
drawn
to
those
wonderful
minds
with
this
pilot
of
his
own
genius
let
the
student
read
one
or
let
him
read
many
he
will
read
advantageously
johnson
said
whilst
you
stand
deliberating
which
book
your
son
shall
read
first
another
boy
has
read
both
read
anything
five
hours
a
day
and
you
will
soon
be
learned
nature
is
much
our
friend
in
this
matter
nature
is
always
clarifying
her
water
and
her
wine
no
filtration
can
be
so
perfect
she
does
the
same
thing
by
books
as
by
her
gases
and
plants
there
is
always
a
selection
in
writers
and
then
a
selection
from
the
selection
in
the
first
place
all
books
that
get
fairly
into
the
vital
air
of
the
world
were
written
by
the
successful
class
by
the
affirming
and
advancing
class
who
utter
what
tens
of
thousands
feel
though
they
can
not
say
there
has
already
been
a
scrutiny
and
choice
from
many
hundreds
of
young
pens
before
the
pamphlet
or
political
chapter
which
you
read
in
a
fugitive
journal
comes
to
your
eye
all
these
are
young
adventurers
who
produce
their
performance
to
the
wise
ear
of
time
who
sits
and
weighs
and
ten
years
hence
out
of
a
million
of
pages
reprints
one
again
it
is
judged
it
is
winnowed
by
all
the
winds
of
opinion
and
what
terrific
selection
has
not
passed
on
it
before
it
can
be
reprinted
after
twenty
years
and
reprinted
after
a
century
it
is
as
if
minos
and
rhadamanthus
had
indorsed
the
writing
is
therefore
an
economy
of
time
to
read
old
and
famed
books
nothing
can
be
preserved
which
is
not
good
and
i
know
beforehand
that
pindar
martial
terence
galen
kepler
galileo
bacon
erasmus
more
will
be
superior
to
the
average
intellect
in
contemporaries
it
is
not
so
easy
to
distinguish
betwixt
notoriety
and
fame
be
sure
then
to
read
no
mean
books
shun
the
spawn
of
the
press
on
the
gossip
of
the
hour
do
not
read
what
you
shall
learn
without
asking
in
the
street
and
the
train
johnson
said
he
always
went
into
stately
shops
and
good
travellers
stop
at
the
best
hotels
for
though
they
cost
more
they
do
not
cost
much
more
and
there
is
the
good
company
and
the
best
information
in
like
manner
the
scholar
knows
that
the
famed
books
contain
first
and
last
the
best
thoughts
and
facts
now
and
then
by
rarest
luck
in
some
foolish
grub
street
is
the
gem
we
want
but
in
the
best
circles
is
the
best
information
if
you
should
transfer
the
amount
of
your
reading
day
by
day
in
the
newspaper
to
the
standard
authors
but
who
dare
speak
of
such
a
thing
the
three
practical
rules
then
which
i
have
to
offer
are
never
read
any
book
that
is
not
a
year
old
never
read
any
but
famed
books
never
read
any
but
what
you
like
or
in
shakespeare
phrase
no
profit
goes
where
is
no
pleasure
in
brief
sir
study
what
you
most
affect
montaigne
says
books
are
a
languid
pleasure
but
i
find
certain
books
vital
and
spermatic
not
leaving
the
reader
what
he
was
he
shuts
the
book
a
richer
man
i
would
never
willingly
read
any
others
than
such
and
i
will
venture
at
the
risk
of
inditing
a
list
of
old
primers
and
grammars
to
count
the
few
books
which
a
superficial
reader
must
thankfully
use
of
the
old
greek
books
i
think
there
are
five
which
we
can
not
spare
homer
who
in
spite
of
pope
and
all
the
learned
uproar
of
centuries
has
really
the
true
fire
and
is
good
for
simple
minds
is
the
true
and
adequate
germ
of
greece
and
occupies
that
place
as
history
which
nothing
can
supply
it
holds
through
all
literature
that
our
best
history
is
still
poetry
it
is
so
in
hebrew
in
sanscrit
and
in
greek
english
history
is
best
known
through
shakspeare
how
much
through
merlin
robin
hood
and
the
scottish
ballads
the
german
through
the
nibelungen
lied
the
spanish
through
the
cid
of
homer
george
chapman
is
the
heroic
translation
though
the
most
literal
prose
version
is
the
best
of
herodotus
whose
history
contains
inestimable
anecdotes
which
brought
it
with
the
learned
into
a
sort
of
disesteem
but
in
these
days
when
it
is
found
that
what
is
most
memorable
of
history
is
a
few
anecdotes
and
that
we
need
not
be
alarmed
though
we
should
find
it
not
dull
it
is
regaining
aeschylus
the
grandest
of
the
three
tragedians
who
has
given
us
under
a
thin
veil
the
first
plantation
of
europe
the
prometheus
is
a
poem
of
the
like
dignity
and
scope
as
the
book
of
job
or
the
norse
of
plato
i
hesitate
to
speak
lest
there
should
be
no
end
you
find
in
him
that
which
you
have
already
found
in
homer
now
ripened
to
thought
the
poet
converted
to
a
philosopher
with
loftier
strains
of
musical
wisdom
than
homer
reached
as
if
homer
were
the
youth
and
plato
the
finished
man
yet
with
no
less
security
of
bold
and
perfect
song
when
he
cares
to
use
it
and
with
some
harpstrings
fetched
from
a
higher
heaven
he
contains
the
future
as
he
came
out
of
the
past
in
plato
you
explore
modern
europe
in
its
causes
and
seed
all
that
in
thought
which
the
history
of
europe
embodies
or
has
yet
to
embody
the
man
finds
himself
anticipated
plato
is
up
with
him
too
nothing
has
escaped
him
every
new
crop
in
the
fertile
harvest
of
reform
every
fresh
suggestion
of
modern
humanity
is
there
if
the
student
wish
to
see
both
sides
and
justice
done
to
the
man
of
the
world
pitiless
exposure
of
pedants
and
the
supremacy
of
truth
and
the
religious
sentiment
he
shall
be
contented
also
why
should
not
young
men
be
educated
on
this
book
it
would
suffice
for
the
tuition
of
the
race
to
test
their
understanding
and
to
express
their
reason
here
is
that
which
is
so
attractive
to
all
men
the
literature
of
aristocracy
shall
i
call
it
the
picture
of
the
best
persons
sentiments
and
manners
by
the
first
master
in
the
best
times
portraits
of
pericles
alcibiades
crito
prodicus
protagoras
anaxagoras
and
socrates
with
the
lovely
background
of
the
athenian
and
suburban
landscape
or
who
can
overestimate
the
images
with
which
he
has
enriched
the
minds
of
men
and
which
pass
like
bullion
in
the
currency
of
all
nations
read
the
phaedo
the
protagoras
the
phaedrus
the
timaeus
the
republic
and
the
apology
of
socrates
plutarch
can
not
be
spared
from
the
smallest
library
first
because
he
is
so
readable
which
is
much
then
that
he
is
medicinal
and
invigorating
the
lives
of
cimon
lycurgus
alexander
demosthenes
phocion
marcellus
and
the
rest
are
what
history
has
of
best
but
this
book
has
taken
care
of
itself
and
the
opinion
of
the
world
is
expressed
in
the
innumerable
cheap
editions
which
make
it
as
accessible
as
a
newspaper
but
plutarch
morals
is
less
known
and
seldom
reprinted
yet
such
a
reader
as
i
am
writing
to
can
as
ill
spare
it
as
the
lives
he
will
read
in
it
the
essays
on
the
daemon
of
socrates
on
isis
and
osiris
on
progress
in
virtue
on
garrulity
on
love
and
thank
anew
the
art
of
printing
and
the
cheerful
domain
of
ancient
thinking
plutarch
charms
by
the
facility
of
his
associations
so
that
it
signifies
little
where
you
open
his
book
you
find
yourself
at
the
olympian
tables
his
memory
is
like
the
isthmian
games
where
all
that
was
excellent
in
greece
was
assembled
and
you
are
stimulated
and
recruited
by
lyric
verses
by
philosophic
sentiments
by
the
forms
and
behavior
of
heroes
by
the
worship
of
the
gods
and
by
the
passing
of
fillets
parsley
and
laurel
wreaths
chariots
armor
sacred
cups
and
utensils
of
sacrifice
an
inestimable
trilogy
of
ancient
social
pictures
are
the
three
banquets
respectively
of
plato
xenophon
and
plutarch
plutarch
has
the
least
claim
to
historical
accuracy
but
the
meeting
of
the
seven
wise
masters
is
a
charming
portraiture
of
ancient
manners
and
discourse
and
is
as
dear
as
the
voice
of
a
fife
and
entertaining
as
a
french
novel
xenophon
delineation
of
athenian
manners
is
an
accessory
to
plato
and
supplies
traits
of
socrates
whilst
plato
has
merits
of
every
kind
being
a
repertory
of
the
wisdom
of
the
ancients
on
the
subject
of
love
a
picture
of
a
feast
of
wits
not
less
descriptive
than
aristophanes
and
lastly
containing
that
ironical
eulogy
of
socrates
which
is
the
source
from
which
all
the
portraits
of
that
head
current
in
europe
have
been
drawn
of
course
a
certain
outline
should
be
obtained
of
greek
history
in
which
the
important
moments
and
persons
can
be
rightly
set
down
but
the
shortest
is
the
best
and
if
one
lacks
stomach
for
voluminous
annals
the
old
slight
and
popular
summary
of
goldsmith
or
gillies
will
serve
the
valuable
part
is
the
age
of
pericles
and
the
next
generation
and
here
we
must
read
the
clouds
of
aristophanes
and
what
more
of
that
master
we
gain
appetite
for
to
learn
our
way
in
the
streets
of
athens
and
to
know
the
tyranny
of
aristophanes
requiring
more
genius
and
sometimes
not
less
cruelty
than
belonged
to
the
official
commanders
aristophanes
is
now
very
accessible
with
much
valuable
commentary
through
the
labors
of
mitchell
and
cartwright
an
excellent
popular
book
is
j
john
ancient
greece
the
life
and
letters
of
niebuhr
even
more
than
his
lectures
furnish
leading
views
and
winckelmann
a
greek
born
out
of
due
time
has
become
essential
to
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
attic
genius
the
secret
of
the
recent
histories
in
german
and
in
english
is
the
discovery
owed
first
to
wolff
and
later
to
boeckh
that
the
sincere
greek
history
of
that
period
must
be
drawn
from
demosthenes
specially
from
the
business
orations
and
from
the
comic
poets
if
we
come
down
a
little
by
natural
steps
from
the
master
to
the
disciples
we
have
six
or
seven
centuries
later
the
platonists
who
also
can
not
be
skipped
plotinus
porphyry
proclus
synesius
jamblichus
of
jamblichus
the
emperor
julian
said
that
he
was
posterior
to
plato
in
time
not
in
genius
of
plotinus
we
have
eulogies
by
porphyry
and
longinus
and
the
favor
of
the
emperor
gallienus
indicating
the
respect
he
inspired
among
his
contemporaries
if
any
one
who
had
read
with
interest
the
isis
and
osiris
of
plutarch
should
then
read
a
chapter
called
providence
by
synesius
translated
into
english
by
thomas
taylor
he
will
find
it
one
of
the
majestic
remains
of
literature
and
like
one
walking
in
the
noblest
of
temples
will
conceive
new
gratitude
to
his
fellowmen
and
a
new
estimate
of
their
nobility
the
imaginative
scholar
will
find
few
stimulants
to
his
brain
like
these
writers
he
has
entered
the
elysian
fields
and
the
grand
and
pleasing
figures
of
gods
and
daemons
and
demoniacal
men
of
the
azonic
and
the
aquatic
gods
daemons
with
fulgid
eyes
and
all
the
rest
of
the
platonic
rhetoric
exalted
a
little
under
the
african
sun
sail
before
his
eyes
the
acolyte
has
mounted
the
tripod
over
the
cave
at
delphi
his
heart
dances
his
sight
is
quickened
these
guides
speak
of
the
gods
with
such
depth
and
with
such
pictorial
details
as
if
they
had
been
bodily
present
at
the
olympian
feasts
the
reader
of
these
books
makes
new
acquaintance
with
his
own
mind
new
regions
of
thought
are
opened
jamblichus
life
of
pythagoras
works
more
directly
on
the
will
than
the
others
since
pythagoras
was
eminently
a
practical
person
the
founder
of
a
school
of
ascetics
and
socialists
a
planter
of
colonies
and
nowise
a
man
of
abstract
studies
alone
the
respectable
and
sometimes
excellent
translations
of
library
have
done
for
literature
what
railroads
have
done
for
internal
intercourse
i
do
not
hesitate
to
read
all
the
books
i
have
named
and
all
good
books
in
translations
what
is
really
best
in
any
book
is
translatable
any
real
insight
or
broad
human
sentiment
nay
i
observe
that
in
our
bible
and
other
books
of
lofty
moral
tone
it
seems
easy
and
inevitable
to
render
the
rhythm
and
music
of
the
original
into
phrases
of
equal
melody
the
italians
have
a
fling
at
translators
traditori
but
i
thank
them
i
rarely
read
any
latin
greek
german
italian
sometimes
not
a
french
book
in
the
original
which
i
can
procure
in
a
good
version
i
like
to
be
beholden
to
the
great
metropolitan
english
speech
the
sea
which
receives
tributaries
from
every
region
under
heaven
i
should
as
soon
think
of
swimming
across
charles
river
when
i
wish
to
go
to
boston
as
of
reading
all
my
books
in
originals
when
i
have
them
rendered
for
me
in
my
mother
tongue
for
history
there
is
great
choice
of
ways
to
bring
the
student
through
early
rome
if
he
can
read
livy
he
has
a
good
book
but
one
of
the
short
english
compends
some
goldsmith
or
ferguson
should
be
used
that
will
place
in
the
cycle
the
bright
stars
of
plutarch
the
poet
horace
is
the
eye
of
the
augustan
age
tacitus
the
wisest
of
historians
and
martial
will
give
him
roman
manners
and
some
very
bad
ones
in
the
early
days
of
the
empire
but
martial
must
be
read
if
read
at
all
in
his
own
tongue
these
will
bring
him
to
gibbon
who
will
take
him
in
charge
and
convey
him
with
abundant
entertainment
down
with
notice
of
all
remarkable
objects
on
the
way
through
fourteen
hundred
years
of
time
he
can
not
spare
gibbon
with
his
vast
reading
with
such
wit
and
continuity
of
mind
that
though
never
profound
his
book
is
one
of
the
conveniences
of
civilization
like
the
proposed
railroad
from
new
york
to
the
pacific
and
i
think
will
be
sure
to
send
the
reader
to
his
memoirs
of
himself
and
the
extracts
from
my
journal
and
abstracts
of
my
readings
which
will
spur
the
laziest
scholar
to
emulation
of
his
prodigious
performance
now
having
our
idler
safe
down
as
far
as
the
fall
of
constantinople
in
he
is
in
very
good
courses
for
here
are
trusty
hands
waiting
for
him
the
cardinal
facts
of
european
history
are
soon
learned
there
is
dante
poem
to
open
the
italian
republics
of
the
middle
age
dante
vita
nuova
to
explain
dante
and
beatrice
and
boccaccio
life
of
dante
a
great
man
to
describe
a
greater
to
help
us
perhaps
a
volume
or
two
of
sismondi
italian
republics
will
be
as
good
as
the
entire
sixteen
when
we
come
to
michel
angelo
his
sonnets
and
letters
must
be
read
with
his
life
by
vasari
or
in
our
day
by
duppa
for
the
church
and
the
feudal
institution
hallam
middle
ages
will
furnish
if
superficial
yet
readable
and
conceivable
outlines
the
life
of
the
emperor
charles
by
the
useful
robertson
is
still
the
key
of
the
following
age
ximenes
columbus
loyola
luther
erasmus
melancthon
francis
henry
elizabeth
and
henry
iv
of
france
are
his
contemporaries
it
is
a
time
of
seeds
and
expansions
whereof
our
recent
civilization
is
the
fruit
if
now
the
relations
of
england
to
european
affairs
bring
him
to
british
ground
he
is
arrived
at
the
very
moment
when
modern
history
takes
new
proportions
he
can
look
back
for
the
legends
and
mythology
to
the
younger
edda
and
the
heimrskringla
of
snorro
sturleson
to

romances
to

life
of
alfred
and
venerable

and
to
the
researches
of
sharon
turner
and
palgrave
hume
will
serve
him
for
an
intelligent
guide
and
in
the
elizabethan
era
he
is
at
the
richest
period
of
the
english
mind
with
the
chief
men
of

and
of

which
that

not
long
after
in
reading
history
he
is
to
prefer
the
history
of
individuals
he
will
not
repent
the
time
he
gives
to
bacon
not
if
he
read
the
advancement
of
learning
the
essays
the
novum
organon
the
history
of
henry
and
then
all
the
letters
especially
those
to
the
earl
of
devonshire
explaining
the
essex
business
and
all
but
his
apophthegms
the
task
is
aided
by
the
strong
mutual
light
which
these
men
shed
on
each
other
thus
the
works
of
ben
jonson
are
a
sort
of
hoop
to
bind
all
these
fine
persons
together
and
to
the
land
to
which
they
belong
he

written
verses
to

on

his

with

many
occasional

and
the
portrait
sketches
in
his
discoveries
and
the
gossiping
record
of
his
opinions
in
his
conversations
with
drummond
of
hawthornden
has
really
illustrated
the
england
of
his
time
if
not
to
the
same
extent
yet
much
in
the

way
as
walter

celebrated
the

another
class
of
books
closely
allied
to
these

of

are
those
which
may
be

of

the

are

selden

conversations

and

there
is
a

i
should
designate
as

such
as

a
list
of
course
that
may
easily
be
swelled
as
dependent
on
individual
caprice
many
men
are
as
tender
and
irritable
as
lovers
in
reference
to
these
predilections
indeed
a
man
library
is
a
sort
of
harem
and
i
observe
that
tender
readers
have
a
great
prudencey
in
showing
their
books
to
a
stranger
the
annals
of
bibliography
afford
many
examples
of
the
delirious
extent
to
which
can
go
when
the
legitimate
delight
in
a
book
is
transferred
to
a
rare
edition
or
to
a
manuscript
this
mania
reached
its
height
about
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
for
an
autograph
of
shakspeare
one
hundred
and
guineas
were
given
in
may
the
library
of
the
duke
of
roxburgh
was
sold
the
sale
lasted
days
we
abridge
the
story
from
dibdin
and
among
the
many
curiosities
was
a
copy
of
boccaccio
published
by
valdarfer
at
venice
in
the
only
perfect
copy
of
this
edition
among
the
distinguished
company
which
attended
the
sale
were
the
duke
of
devonshire
earl
spencer
and
the
duke
of
marlborough
then
marquis
of
blandford
the
bid
stood
at
five
hundred
guineas
a
thousand
guineas
said
earl
spencer
and
ten
added
the
marquis
you
might
hear
a
pin
drop
all
eyes
were
bent
on
the
bidders
now
they
talked
apart
now
ate
a
biscuit
now
made
a
bet
but
without
the
least
thought
of
yielding
one
to
the
other
two
thousand
pounds
said
the
marquis
the
earl
spencer
bethought
him
like
a
prudent
general
of
useless
bloodshed
and
waste
of
powder
and
had
paused
a
quarter
of
a
minute
when
lord
althorp
with
long
steps
came
to
his
side
as
if
to
bring
his
father
a
fresh
lance
to
renew
the
fight
father
and
son
whispered
together
and
earl
spencer
exclaimed
two
thousand
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
an
electric
shock
went
through
the
assembly
and
ten
quietly
added
the
marquis
there
ended
the
strife
ere
evans
let
the
hammer
fall
he
paused
the
ivory
instrument
swept
the
air
the
spectators
stood
dumb
when
the
hammer
fell
the
stroke
of
its
fall
sounded
on
the
farthest
shores
of
italy
the
tap
of
that
hammer
was
heard
in
the
libraries
of
rome
milan
and
venice
boccaccio
stirred
in
his
sleep
of
five
hundred
years
and
van
praet
groped
in
vain
amidst
the
royal
alcoves
in
paris
to
detect
a
copy
of
the
famed
valdarfer
boccaccio
another
class
i
distinguish
by
the
term
anatomy
of
melancholy
is
a
book
of
great
learning
to
read
it
is
like
reading
in
a
dictionary
is
an
inventory
to
remind
us
how
many
classes
and
species
of
facts
exist
and
in
observing
into
what
strange
and
multiplex
learning
has
strayed
to
infer
our
opulence
neither
is
a
dictionary
a
bad
book
to
read
there
is
no
cant
in
it
no
excess
of
explanation
and
it
is
full
of
suggestion
the
raw
material
of
possible
poems
and
histories
nothing
is
wanting
but
a
little
shuffling
sorting
ligature
and
cartilage
out
of
a
hundred
examples
cornelius
agrippa
on
the
vanity
of
arts
and
sciences
is
a
specimen
of
that
which
grew
to
be
the
habit
of
the
gluttonous
readers
of
his
time
like
the
modern
germans
they
read
a
literature
whilst
other
mortals
read
a
few
books
they
read
voraciously
and
must
disburden
themselves
so
they
take
any
general
topic
as
melancholy
or
praise
of
science
or
praise
of
folly
and
write
and
quote
without
method
or
end
now
and
then
out
of
that
affluence
of
their
learning
comes
a
fine
sentence
from
theophrastus
or
seneca
or
boëthius
but
no
high
method
no
inspiring
efflux
but
one
can
not
afford
to
read
for
a
few
sentences
they
are
good
only
as
strings
of
suggestive
words
there
is
another
class
more
needful
to
the
present
age
because
the
currents
of
custom
run
now
in
another
direction
and
leave
us
dry
on
this
side
i
mean
the
a
right
metaphysics
should
do
justice
to
the
coördinate
powers
of
imagination
insight
understanding
and
will
poetry
with
its
aids
of
mythology
and
romance
must
be
well
allowed
for
an
imaginative
creature
men
are
ever
lapsing
into
a
beggarly
habit
wherein
everything
that
is
not
ciphering
that
is
which
does
not
serve
the
tyrannical
animal
is
hustled
out
of
sight
our
orators
and
writers
are
of
the
same
poverty
and
in
this
neither
the
imagination
the
great
awakening
power
nor
the
morals
creative
of
genius
and
of
men
are
addressed
but
though
orator
and
poet
are
of
this
hunger
party
the
capacities
remain
we
must
have
symbols
the
child
asks
you
for
a
story
and
is
thankful
for
the
poorest
it
is
not
poor
to
him
but
radiant
with
meaning
the
man
asks
for
a
novel
that
is
asks
leave
for
a
few
hours
to
be
a
poet
and
to
paint
things
as
they
ought
to
be
the
youth
asks
for
a
poem
the
very
dunces
wish
to
go
to
the
theatre
what
private
heavens
can
we
not
open
by
yielding
to
all
the
suggestion
of
rich
music
we
must
have
idolatries
mythologies
some
swing
and
verge
for
the
creative
power
lying
coiled
and
cramped
here
driving
ardent
natures
to
insanity
and
crime
if
it
do
not
find
vent
without
the
great
and
beautiful
arts
which
speak
to
the
sense
of
beauty
a
man
seems
to
me
a
poor
naked
shivering
creature
these
are
his
becoming
draperies
which
warm
and
adorn
him
whilst
the
prudential
and
economical
tone
of
society
starves
the
imagination
affronted
nature
gets
such
indemnity
as
she
may
the
novel
is
that
allowance
and
frolic
the
imagination
finds
everything
else
pins
it
down
and
men
flee
for
redress
to
byron
scott
disraeli
dumas
sand
balzac
dickens
thackeray
and
reade
their
education
is
neglected
but
the
circulating
library
and
the
theatre
as
well
as
the
the
notch
mountains
the
adirondac
country
the
tour
to
mont
blanc
to
the
white
hills
and
the
ghauts
make
such
amends
as
they
can
the
imagination
infuses
a
certain
volatility
and
intoxication
it
has
a
flute
which
sets
the
atoms
of
our
frame
in
a
dance
like
planets
and
once
so
liberated
the
whole
man
reeling
drunk
to
the
music
they
never
quite
subside
to
their
old
stony
state
but
what
is
the
imagination
only
an
arm
or
weapon
of
the
interior
energy
only
the
precursor
of
the
reason
and
books
that
treat
the
old
pedantries
of
the
world
our
times
places
professions
customs
opinions
histories
with
a
certain
freedom
and
distribute
things
not
after
the
usages
of
america
and
europe
but
after
the
laws
of
right
reason
and
with
as
daring
a
freedom
as
we
use
in
dreams
put
us
on
our
feet
again
enable
us
to
form
an
original
judgment
of
our
duties
and
suggest
new
thoughts
for
lucrezia
floriani
le
péché
de
antoine
jeanne
of
george
sand
are
great
steps
from
the
novel
of
one
termination
which
we
all
read
twenty
years
ago
yet
how
far
off
from
life
and
manners
and
motives
the
novel
still
is
life
lies
about
us
dumb
the
day
as
we
know
it
has
not
yet
found
a
tongue
these
stories
are
to
the
plots
of
real
life
what
the
figures
in
la
belle
assemblée
which
represent
the
fashion
of
the
month
are
to
portraits
but
the
novel
will
find
the
way
to
our
interiors
one
day
and
will
not
always
be
the
novel
of
costume
merely
i
do
not
think
them
inoperative
now
so
much
can
not
leave
the
young
men
and
maidens
untouched
and
doubtless
it
gives
some
ideal
dignity
to
the
day
the
young
study
noble
behavior
and
as
the
player
in
consuelo
insists
that
he
and
his
colleagues
on
the
boards
have
taught
princes
the
fine
etiquette
and
strokes
of
grace
and
dignity
which
they
practise
with
so
much
effect
in
their
villas
and
among
their
dependents
so
i
often
see
traces
of
the
scotch
or
the
french
novel
in
the
courtesy
and
brilliancy
of
young
midshipmen
collegians
and
clerks
indeed
when
one
observes
how
ill
and
ugly
people
make
their
loves
and
quarrels
is
pity
they
should
not
read
novels
a
little
more
to
import
the
fine
generosities
and
the
clear
firm
conduct
which
are
as
becoming
in
the
unions
and
separations
which
love
effects
under
shingle
roofs
as
in
palaces
and
among
illustrious
personages
in
novels
the
most
serious
questions
are
really
beginning
to
be
discussed
what
made
the
popularity
of
jane
eyre
but
that
a
central
question
was
answered
in
some
sort
the
question
there
answered
in
regard
to
a
vicious
marriage
will
always
be
treated
according
to
the
habit
of
the
party
a
person
of
commanding
individualism
will
answer
it
as
rochester
does
as
cleopatra
as
milton
as
george
sand
do
magnifying
the
exception
into
a
rule
dwarfing
the
world
into
an
exception
a
person
of
less
courage
that
is
of
less
constitution
will
answer
as
the
heroine
does
giving
way
to
fate
to
conventionalism
to
the
actual
state
and
doings
of
men
and
women
for
the
most
part
our
is
a
passion
for
results
we
admire
parks
and
beauties
and
the
homage
of
and
parliaments
they
make
us
skeptical
by
giving
prominence
to
wealth
and
social
position
i
remember
when
some
peering
eyes
of
boys
discovered
that
the
oranges
hanging
on
the
boughs
of
an
in
a
gay
piazza
were
tied
to
the
twigs
by
thread
i
fear
is
so
with
the
prosperities
nature
has
a
magic
by
which
she
fits
the
man
to
his
fortunes
by
making
them
the
fruit
of
his
character
but
the
novelist
plucks
this
event
here
and
that
fortune
there
and
ties
them
rashly
to
his
figures
to
tickle
the
fancy
of
his
readers
with
a
cloying
success
or
scare
them
with
shocks
of
tragedy
and
so
on
the
whole
a
juggle
we
are
cheated
into
laughter
or
wonder
by
feats
which
only
oddly
combine
acts
that
we
do
every
day
there
is
no
new
element
no
power
no
furtherance
is
only
confectionery
not
the
raising
of
new
corn
great
is
the
poverty
of
their
inventions
was
beautiful
and
he
fell
in
money
and
killing
and
the
wandering
jew
and
persuading
the
lover
that
his
mistress
is
betrothed
to
another
these
are
the
mainsprings
new
names
but
no
new
qualities
in
the
men
and
women
hence
the
vain
endeavor
to
keep
any
bit
of
this
fairy
gold
which
has
rolled
like
a
brook
through
our
hands
a
thousand
thoughts
awoke
great
rainbows
seemed
to
span
the
sky
a
morning
among
the
mountains
but
we
close
the
book
and
not
a
ray
remains
in
the
memory
of
evening
but
this
passion
for
romance
and
this
disappointment
show
how
much
we
need
real
elevations
and
pure
poetry
that
which
shall
show
us
in
morning
and
night
in
stars
and
mountains
and
in
all
the
plight
and
circumstance
of
men
the
analogons
of
our
own
thoughts
and
a
like
impression
made
by
a
just
book
and
by
the
face
of
nature
if
our
times
are
sterile
in
genius
we
must
cheer
us
with
books
of
rich
and
believing
men
who
had
atmosphere
and
amplitude
about
them
every
good
fable
every
mythology
every
biography
out
of
a
religious
age
every
passage
of
love
and
even
philosophy
and
science
when
they
proceed
from
an
intellectual
integrity
and
are
not
detached
and
critical
have
the
imaginative
element
the
greek
fables
the
persian
history
firdousi
the
younger
edda
of
the
scandinavians
the
chronicle
of
the
cid
the
poem
of
dante
the
sonnets
of
michel
angelo
the
english
drama
of
shakspeare
beaumont
and
fletcher
and
ford
and
even
the
prose
of
bacon
and
milton
in
our
time
the
ode
of
wordsworth
and
the
poems
and
the
prose
of
goethe
have
this
richness
and
leave
room
for
hope
and
for
generous
attempts
there
is
no
room
left
and
yet
i
might
as
well
not
have
begun
as
to
leave
out
a
class
of
books
which
are
the
best
i
mean
the
bibles
of
the
world
or
the
sacred
books
of
each
nation
which
express
for
each
the
supreme
result
of
their
experience
after
the
hebrew
and
greek
scriptures
which
constitute
the
sacred
books
of
christendom
these
are
the
desatir
of
the
persians
and
the
zoroastrian
oracles
the
vedas
and
laws
of
menu
the
upanishads
the
vishnu
purana
the
bhagvat
geeta
of
the
hindoos
the
books
of
the
buddhists
the
chinese
classic
of
four
books
containing
the
wisdom
of
confucius
and
mencius
also
such
other
books
as
have
acquired
a
authority
in
the
world
as
expressing
the
highest
sentiment
and
hope
of
nations
such
are
the
hermes
trismegistus
pretending
to
be
egyptian
remains
the
sentences
of
epictetus
of
marcus
antoninus
the
vishnu
sarma
of
the
hindoos
the
gulistan
of
saadi
the
imitation
of
christ
of
thomas
à
kempis
and
the
thoughts
of
pascal
all
these
books
are
the
majestic
expressions
of
the
universal
conscience
and
are
more
to
our
daily
purpose
than
this
almanac
or
this
day
newspaper
but
they
are
for
the
closet
and
to
be
read
on
the
bended
knee
their
communications
are
not
to
be
given
or
taken
with
the
lips
and
the
end
of
the
tongue
but
out
of
the
glow
of
the
cheek
and
with
the
throbbing
heart
friendship
should
give
and
take
solitude
and
time
brood
and
ripen
heroes
absorb
and
enact
them
they
are
not
to
be
held
by
letters
printed
on
a
page
but
are
living
characters
translatable
into
every
tongue
and
form
of
life
i
read
them
on
lichens
and
bark
i
watch
them
on
waves
on
the
beach
they
fly
in
birds
they
creep
in
worms
i
detect
them
in
laughter
and
blushes
and
of
men
and
women
these
are
scriptures
which
the
missionary
might
well
carry
over
prairie
desert
and
ocean
to
siberia
japan
timbuctoo
yet
he
will
find
that
the
spirit
which
is
in
them
journeys
faster
than
he
and
greets
him
on
his
arrival
was
there
already
long
before
him
the
missionary
must
be
carried
by
it
and
find
it
there
or
he
goes
in
vain
is
there
any
geography
in
these
things
we
call
them
asiatic
we
call
them
primeval
but
perhaps
that
is
only
optical
for
nature
is
always
equal
to
herself
and
there
are
as
good
pairs
of
eyes
and
ears
now
in
the
planet
as
ever
were
only
these
ejaculations
of
the
soul
are
uttered
one
or
a
few
at
a
time
at
long
intervals
and
it
takes
millenniums
to
make
a
bible
these
are
a
few
of
the
books
which
the
old
and
the
later
times
have
yielded
us
which
will
reward
the
time
spent
on
them
in
comparing
the
number
of
good
books
with
the
shortness
of
life
many
might
well
be
read
by
proxy
if
we
had
good
proxies
and
it
would
be
well
for
sincere
young
men
to
borrow
a
hint
from
the
french
institute
and
the
british
association
and
as
they
divide
the
whole
body
into
sections
each
of
which
sit
upon
and
report
of
certain
matters
confided
to
them
so
let
each
scholar
associate
himself
to
such
persons
as
he
can
rely
on
in
a
literary
club
in
which
each
shall
undertake
a
single
work
or
series
for
which
he
is
qualified
for
example
how
attractive
is
the
whole
literature
of
the
roman
de
la
rose
the
fabliaux
and
the
of
the
french
troubadours
yet
who
in
boston
has
time
for
that
but
one
of
our
company
shall
undertake
it
shall
study
and
master
it
and
shall
report
on
it
as
under
oath
shall
give
us
the
sincere
result
as
it
lies
in
his
mind
adding
nothing
keeping
nothing
back
another
member
meantime
shall
as
honestly
search
sift
and
as
truly
report
on

mythology
the

the

of

a

the
diamond
lens
i
the
bending
of
the
twig
from
a
very
early
period
of
my
life
the
entire
bent
of
my
inclinations
had
been
towards
microscopic
investigations
when
i
was
not
more
than
ten
years
old
a
distant
relative
of
our
family
hoping
to
astonish
my
inexperience
constructed
a
simple
microscope
for
me
by
drilling
in
a
disk
of
copper
a
small
hole
in
which
a
drop
of
pure
water
was
sustained
by
capillary
attraction
this
very
primitive
apparatus
magnifying
some
fifty
diameters
presented
it
is
true
only
indistinct
and
imperfect
forms
but
still
sufficiently
wonderful
to
work
up
my
imagination
to
a
preternatural
state
of
excitement
seeing
me
so
interested
in
this
rude
instrument
my
cousin
explained
to
me
all
that
he
knew
about
the
principles
of
the
microscope
related
to
me
a
few
of
the
wonders
which
had
been
accomplished
through
its
agency
and
ended
by
promising
to
send
me
one
regularly
constructed
immediately
on
his
return
to
the
city
i
counted
the
days
the
hours
the
minutes
that
intervened
between
that
promise
and
his
departure
meantime
i
was
not
idle
every
transparent
substance
that
bore
the
remotest
semblance
to
a
lens
i
eagerly
seized
upon
and
employed
in
vain
attempts
to
realize
that
instrument
the
theory
of
whose
construction
i
as
yet
only
vaguely
comprehended
all
panes
of
glass
containing
these
oblate
spheroidal
knots
familiarly
known
as
bull
eyes
were
ruthlessly
destroyed
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
lenses
of
marvellous
power
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
extract
the
crystalline
humor
from
the
eyes
of
fishes
and
animals
and
endeavored
to
press
it
into
the
microscopic
service
i
plead
guilty
to
having
stolen
the
glasses
from
my
aunt
agatha
spectacles
with
a
dim
idea
of
grinding
them
into
lenses
of
wondrous
magnifying
properties
in
which
attempt
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
that
i
totally
failed
at
last
the
promised
instrument
came
it
was
of
that
order
known
as
field
simple
microscope
and
had
cost
perhaps
about
fifteen
dollars
as
far
as
educational
purposes
went
a
better
apparatus
could
not
have
been
selected
accompanying
it
was
a
small
treatise
on
the
microscope
its
history
uses
and
discoveries
i
comprehended
then
for
the
first
time
the
arabian
entertainments
the
dull
veil
of
ordinary
existence
that
hung
across
the
world
seemed
suddenly
to
roll
away
and
to
lay
bare
a
land
of
enchantments
i
felt
towards
my
companions
as
the
seer
might
feel
towards
the
ordinary
masters
of
men
i
held
conversations
with
xanure
in
a
tongue
which
they
could
not
understand
i
was
in
daily
communication
with
living
wonders
such
as
they
never
imagined
in
their
wildest
visions
i
penetrated
beyond
the
external
portal
of
things
and
roamed
through
the
sanctuaries
where
they
beheld
only
a
drop
of
rain
slowly
rolling
down
the
i
saw
a
universe
of
beings
animated
with
all
the
passions
common
to
physical
life
and
convulsing
their
minute
sphere
with
struggles
as
fierce
and
protracted
as
those
of
men
in
the
common
spots
of
mould
which
my
mother
good
housekeeper
that
she
was
fiercely
scooped
away
from
her
jam
pots
there
abode
for
me
under
the
name
of
mildew
enchanted
gardens
filled
with
dells
and
avenues
of
the
densest
foliage
and
most
astonishing
verdure
while
from
the
fantastic
boughs
of
these
microscopic
forests
hung
strange
fruits
glittering
with
green
and
silver
and
gold
it
was
no
scientific
thirst
that
at
this
time
filled
my
mind
it
was
the
pure
enjoyment
of
a
poet
to
whom
a
world
of
wonders
has
been
disclosed
i
talked
of
my
solitary
pleasures
to
none
alone
with
my
microscope
i
dimmed
my
sight
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
poring
over
the
marvels
which
it
unfolded
to
me
i
was
like
one
who
having
discovered
the
ancient
eden
still
existing
in
all
its
primitive
glory
should
resolve
to
enjoy
it
in
solitude
and
never
betray
to
mortal
the
secret
of
its
locality
the
rod
of
my
life
was
bent
at
this
moment
i
destined
myself
to
be
a
microscopist
of
course
like
every
novice
i
fancied
myself
a
discoverer
i
was
ignorant
at
the
time
of
the
thousands
of
acute
intellects
engaged
in
the
same
pursuit
as
myself
and
with
the
advantages
of
instruments
a
thousand
times
more
powerful
than
mine
the
names
of
leeuwenhoek
williamson
spencer
ehrenberg
schultz
dujardin
schact
and
schleiden
were
then
entirely
unknown
to
me
or
if
known
i
was
ignorant
of
their
patient
and
wonderful
researches
in
every
fresh
specimen
of
cryptogamia
which
i
placed
beneath
my
instrument
i
believed
that
i
discovered
wonders
of
which
the
world
was
as
yet
ignorant
i
remember
well
the
thrill
of
delight
and
admiration
that
shot
through
me
the
first
time
that
i
discovered
the
common
wheel
animalcule
expanding
and
contracting
its
flexible
spokes
and
seemingly
rotating
through
the
water
alas
as
i
grew
older
and
obtained
some
works
treating
of
my
favorite
study
i
found
that
i
was
only
on
the
threshold
of
a
science
to
the
investigation
of
which
some
of
the
greatest
men
of
the
age
were
devoting
their
lives
and
intellects
as
i
grew
up
my
parents
who
saw
but
little
likelihood
of
anything
practical
resulting
from
the
examination
of
bits
of
moss
and
drops
of
water
through
a
brass
tube
and
a
piece
of
glass
were
anxious
that
i
should
choose
a
profession
it
was
their
desire
that
i
should
enter
the
of
my
uncle
ethan
blake
a
prosperous
merchant
who
carried
on
business
in
new
york
this
suggestion
i
decisively
combated
i
had
no
taste
for
trade
i
should
only
make
a
failure
in
short
i
refused
to
become
a
merchant
but
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
select
some
pursuit
my
parents
were
staid
new
england
people
who
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
labor
and
therefore
although
thanks
to
the
bequest
of
my
poor
aunt
agatha
i
should
on
coming
of
age
inherit
a
small
fortune
sufficient
to
place
me
above
want
it
was
decided
that
instead
of
waiting
for
this
i
should
act
the
nobler
part
and
employ
the
intervening
years
in
rendering
myself
independent
after
much
cogitation
i
complied
with
the
wishes
of
my
family
and
selected
a
profession
i
determined
to
study
medicine
at
the
new
york
academy
this
disposition
of
my
future
suited
me
a
removal
from
my
relatives
would
enable
me
to
dispose
of
my
time
as
i
pleased
without
fear
of
detection
as
long
as
i
paid
my
academy
fees
i
might
shirk
attending
the
lectures
if
i
chose
and
as
i
never
had
the
remotest
intention
of
standing
an
examination
there
was
no
danger
of
my
being
plucked
besides
a
metropolis
was
the
place
for
me
there
i
could
obtain
excellent
instruments
the
newest
publications
intimacy
with
men
of
pursuits
kindred
to
my
own
in
short
all
things
necessary
to
insure
a
profitable
devotion
of
my
life
to
my
beloved
science
i
had
an
abundance
of
money
few
desires
that
were
not
bounded
by
my
illuminating
mirror
on
one
side
and
my
on
the
other
what
therefore
was
to
prevent
my
becoming
an
illustrious
investigator
of
the
veiled
worlds
it
was
with
the
most
buoyant
hopes
that
i
left
my
new
england
home
and
established
myself
in
new
york
ii
the
longing
of
a
man
of
science
my
first
step
of
course
was
to
find
suitable
apartments
these
i
obtained
after
a
couple
of
days
search
in
fourth
avenue
a
very
pretty
unfurnished
containing
bedroom
and
a
smaller
apartment
which
i
intended
to
fit
up
as
a
laboratory
i
furnished
my
lodgings
simply
but
rather
elegantly
and
then
devoted
all
my
energies
to
the
adornment
of
the
temple
of
my
worship
i
visited
pike
the
celebrated
optician
and
passed
in
review
his
splendid
collection
of
microscopes
field
compound
higham
spencer
nachet
binocular
that
founded
on
the
principles
of
the
stereoscope
and
at
length
fixed
upon
that
form
known
as
spencer
trunnion
microscope
as
combining
the
greatest
number
of
improvements
with
an
almost
perfect
freedom
from
tremor
along
with
this
i
purchased
every
possible
accessory
drawtubes
micrometers
a
achromatic
condensers
white
cloud
illuminators
prisms
parabolic
condensers
polarizing
apparatus
forceps
aquatic
boxes
with
a
host
of
other
articles
all
of
which
would
have
been
useful
in
the
hands
of
an
experienced
microscopist
but
as
i
afterwards
discovered
were
not
of
the
slightest
present
value
to
me
it
takes
years
of
practice
to
know
how
to
use
a
complicated
microscope
the
optician
looked
suspiciously
at
me
as
i
made
these
wholesale
purchases
he
evidently
was
uncertain
whether
to
set
me
down
as
some
scientific
celebrity
or
a
madman
i
think
he
inclined
to
the
latter
belief
i
suppose
i
was
mad
every
great
genius
is
mad
upon
the
subject
in
which
he
is
greatest
the
unsuccessful
madman
is
disgraced
and
called
a
lunatic
mad
or
not
i
set
myself
to
work
with
a
zeal
which
few
scientific
students
have
ever
equalled
i
had
everything
to
learn
relative
to
the
delicate
study
upon
which
i
had
embarked
a
study
involving
the
most
earnest
patience
the
most
rigid
analytic
powers
the
steadiest
hand
the
most
untiring
eye
the
most
refined
and
subtile
manipulation
for
a
long
time
half
my
apparatus
lay
inactively
on
the
shelves
of
my
laboratory
which
was
now
most
amply
furnished
with
every
possible
contrivance
for
facilitating
my
investigations
the
fact
was
that
i
did
not
know
how
to
use
some
of
my
scientific
accessories
never
having
been
taught
microscopies
and
those
whose
use
i
understood
theoretically
were
of
little
avail
until
by
practice
i
could
attain
the
necessary
delicacy
of
handling
still
such
was
the
fury
of
my
ambition
such
the
untiring
perseverance
of
my
experiments
that
difficult
of
credit
as
it
may
be
in
the
course
of
one
year
i
became
theoretically
and
practically
an
accomplished
microscopist
during
this
period
of
my
labors
in
which
i
submitted
specimens
of
every
substance
that
came
under
my
observation
to
the
action
of
my
lenses
i
became
a
discoverer
in
a
small
way
it
is
true
for
i
was
very
young
but
still
a
discoverer
it
was
i
who
destroyed
ehrenberg
theory
that
the
was
an
animal
and
proved
that
his
monads
with
stomachs
and
eyes
were
merely
phases
of
the
formation
of
a
vegetable
cell
and
were
when
they
reached
their
mature
state
incapable
of
the
act
of
conjugation
or
any
true
generative
act
without
which
no
organism
rising
to
any
stage
of
life
higher
than
vegetable
can
be
said
to
be
complete
it
was
i
who
resolved
the
singular
problem
of
rotation
in
the
cells
and
hairs
of
plants
into
ciliary
attraction
in
spite
of
the
assertions
of
wenham
and
others
that
my
explanation
was
the
result
of
an
optical
illusion
but
notwithstanding
these
discoveries
laboriously
and
painfully
made
as
they
were
i
felt
horribly
dissatisfied
at
every
step
i
found
myself
stopped
by
the
imperfections
of
my
instruments
like
all
active
microscopists
i
gave
my
imagination
full
play
indeed
it
is
a
common
complaint
against
many
such
that
they
supply
the
defects
of
their
instruments
with
the
creations
of
their
brains
i
imagined
depths
beyond
depths
in
nature
which
the
limited
power
of
my
lenses
prohibited
me
from
exploring
i
lay
awake
at
night
constructing
imaginary
microscopes
of
immeasurable
power
with
which
i
seemed
to
pierce
through
all
the
envelopes
of
matter
down
to
its
original
atom
how
i
cursed
those
imperfect
mediums
which
necessity
through
ignorance
compelled
me
to
use
how
i
longed
to
discover
the
secret
of
some
perfect
lens
whose
magnifying
power
should
be
limited
only
by
the
resolvability
of
the
object
and
which
at
the
same
time
should
be
free
from
spherical
and
chromatic
aberrations
in
short
from
all
the
obstacles
over
which
the
poor
microscopist
finds
himself
continually
stumbling
i
felt
convinced
that
the
simple
microscope
composed
of
a
single
lens
of
such
vast
yet
perfect
power
was
possible
of
construction
to
attempt
to
bring
the
compound
microscope
up
to
such
a
pitch
would
have
been
commencing
at
the
wrong
end
this
latter
being
simply
a
partially
successful
endeavor
to
remedy
those
very
defects
of
the
simple
instrument
which
if
conquered
would
leave
nothing
to
be
desired
it
was
in
this
mood
of
mind
that
i
became
a
constructive
microscopist
after
another
year
passed
in
this
new
pursuit
experimenting
on
every
imaginable
substance
glass
gems
flints
crystals
artificial
crystals
formed
of
the
alloy
of
various
vitreous
materials
in
short
having
constructed
as
many
varieties
of
lenses
as
argus
had
eyes
i
found
myself
precisely
where
i
started
with
nothing
gained
save
an
extensive
knowledge
of
i
was
almost
dead
with
despair
my
parents
were
surprised
at
my
apparent
want
of
progress
in
my
medical
studies
i
had
not
attended
one
lecture
since
my
arrival
in
the
city
and
the
expenses
of
my
mad
pursuit
had
been
so
great
as
to
embarrass
me
very
seriously
i
was
in
this
frame
of
mind
one
day
experimenting
in
my
laboratory
on
a
small
diamond
that
stone
from
its
great
refracting
power
having
always
occupied
my
attention
more
than
any
other
when
a
young
frenchman
who
lived
on
the
floor
above
me
and
who
was
in
the
habit
of
occasionally
visiting
me
entered
the
room
i
think
that
jules
simon
was
a
jew
he
had
many
traits
of
the
hebrew
character
a
love
of
jewelry
of
dress
and
of
good
living
there
was
something
mysterious
about
him
he
always
had
something
to
sell
and
yet
went
into
excellent
society
when
i
say
sell
i
should
perhaps
have
said
peddle
for
his
operations
were
generally
confined
to
the
disposal
of
single
articles
a
picture
for
instance
or
a
rare
carving
in
ivory
or
a
pair
of
or
the
dress
of
a
mexican
when
i
was
first
furnishing
my
rooms
he
paid
me
a
visit
which
ended
in
my
purchasing
an
antique
silver
lamp
which
he
assured
me
was
a
cellini
it
was
handsome
enough
even
for
that
and
some
other
for
my
why
simon
should
pursue
this
petty
trade
i
never
could
imagine
he
apparently
had
plenty
of
money
and
had
the
of
the
best
houses
in
the
city
taking
care
however
i
suppose
to
drive
no
bargains
within
the
enchanted
circle
of
the
upper
ten
i
came
at
length
to
the
conclusion
that
this
peddling
was
but
a
mask
to
cover
some
greater
object
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
believe
my
young
acquaintance
to
be
implicated
in
the
that
however
was
none
of
my
affair
on
the
present
occasion
simon
entered
my
room
in
a
state
of
considerable
excitement
mon
he
cried
before
i
could
even
offer
him
the
ordinary
salutation
it
has
occurred
to
me
to
be
the
witness
of
the
most
astonishing
things
in
the
world
i
promenade
myself
to
the
house
of
madame
how
does
the
little
animal
name
himself
in
the
latin
vulpes
i
answered
ah
yes
vulpes
i
promenade
myself
to
the
house
of
madame
vulpes
the
spirit
medium
yes
the
great
medium
great
heavens
what
a
woman
i
write
on
a
slip
of
paper
many
of
questions
concerning
affairs
the
most
secret
affairs
that
conceal
themselves
in
the
abysses
of
my
heart
the
most
profound
and
behold
by
example
what
occurs
this
devil
of
a
woman
makes
me
replies
the
most
truthful
to
all
of
them
she
talks
to
me
of
things
that
i
do
not
love
to
talk
of
to
myself
what
am
i
to
think
i
am
fixed
to
the
earth
am
i
to
understand
you
simon
that
this
vulpes
replied
to
questions
secretly
written
by
you
which
questions
related
to
events
known
only
to
yourself
ah
more
than
that
more
than
that
he
answered
with
an
air
of
some
alarm
she
related
to
me
things
but
he
added
after
a
pause
and
suddenly
changing
his
manner
why
occupy
ourselves
with
these
follies
it
was
all
the
biology
without
doubt
it
goes
without
saying
that
it
has
not
my
but
why
are
we
here
it
has
occurred
to
me
to
discover
the
most
beautiful
thing
as
you
can
a
vase
with
green
lizards
on
it
composed
by
the
great
bernard
palissy
it
is
in
my
apartment
let
us
mount
i
go
to
show
it
to
you
i
followed
simon
mechanically
but
my
thoughts
were
far
from
palissy
and
his
enamelled
ware
although
i
like
him
was
seeking
in
the
dark
after
a
great
discovery
this
casual
mention
of
the
spiritualist
madame
vulpes
set
me
on
a
new
track
what
if
this
spiritualism
should
be
really
a
great
fact
what
if
through
communication
with
subtiler
organisms
than
my
own
i
could
reach
at
a
single
bound
the
goal
which
perhaps
a
life
of
agonizing
mental
toil
would
never
enable
me
to
attain
while
purchasing
the
palissy
vase
from
my
friend
simon
i
was
mentally
arranging
a
visit
to
madame
vulpes
iii
the
spirit
of
leeuwenhoek
two
evenings
after
this
thanks
to
an
arrangement
by
letter
and
the
promise
of
an
ample
fee
i
found
madame
vulpes
awaiting
me
at
her
residence
alone
she
was
a
woman
with
a
keen
and
rather
cruel
dark
eye
and
an
exceedingly
sensual
expression
about
her
mouth
and
under
jaw
she
received
me
in
perfect
silence
in
an
apartment
on
the
ground
floor
very
sparely
furnished
in
the
centre
of
the
room
close
to
where
vulpes
sat
there
was
a
common
round
mahogany
table
if
i
had
come
for
the
purpose
of
sweeping
her
chimney
the
woman
could
not
have
looked
more
indifferent
to
my
appearance
there
was
no
attempt
to
inspire
the
visitor
with
any
awe
everything
bore
a
simple
and
practical
aspect
this
intercourse
with
the
spiritual
world
was
evidently
as
familiar
an
occupation
with
vulpes
as
eating
her
dinner
or
riding
in
an
omnibus
you
come
for
a
communication
mr
linley
said
the
medium
in
a
dry
tone
of
voice
by
appointment
yes
what
sort
of
communication
do
you
want
a
written
one
yes
i
wish
for
a
written
one
from
any
particular
spirit
yes
have
you
ever
known
this
spirit
on
this
earth
never
he
died
long
before
i
was
born
i
wish
merely
to
obtain
from
him
some
information
which
he
ought
to
be
able
to
give
better
than
any
other
will
you
seat
yourself
at
the
table
linley
said
the
medium
and
place
your
hands
upon
it
i
obeyed
vulpes
being
seated
opposite
me
with
her
hands
also
on
the
table
we
remained
thus
for
about
a
minute
and
a
half
when
a
violent
succession
of
raps
came
on
the
table
on
the
back
of
my
chair
on
the
floor
immediately
under
my
feet
and
even
on
the
window
panes
vulpes
smiled
composedly
they
are
very
strong
she
remarked
you
are
fortunate
she
then
continued
will
the
spirits
communicate
with
this
gentleman
vigorous
affirmative
will
the
particular
spirit
he
desires
to
speak
with
communicate
a
very
confused
rapping
followed
this
question
i
know
what
they
mean
said
vulpes
addressing
herself
to
me
they
wish
you
to
write
down
the
name
of
the
particular
spirit
that
you
desire
to
converse
with
is
that
so
she
added
speaking
to
her
invisible
guests
that
it
was
so
was
evident
from
the
numerous
affirmatory
responses
while
this
was
going
on
i
tore
a
slip
from
my
and
scribbled
a
name
under
the
table
will
this
spirit
communicate
in
writing
with
this
gentleman
asked
the
medium
once
more
after
a
moment
pause
her
hand
seemed
to
be
seized
with
a
violent
tremor
shaking
so
forcibly
that
the
table
vibrated
she
said
that
a
spirit
had
seized
her
hand
and
would
write
i
handed
her
some
sheets
of
paper
that
were
on
the
table
and
a
pencil
the
latter
she
held
loosely
in
her
hand
which
presently
began
to
move
over
the
paper
with
a
singular
and
seemingly
involuntary
motion
after
a
few
moments
had
elapsed
she
handed
me
the
paper
on
which
i
found
written
in
a
large
uncultivated
hand
the
words
he
is
not
here
but
has
been
sent
for
a
pause
of
a
minute
or
so
now
ensued
during
which
vulpes
remained
perfectly
silent
but
the
raps
continued
at
regular
intervals
when
the
short
period
i
mention
had
elapsed
the
hand
of
the
medium
was
again
seized
with
its
convulsive
tremor
and
she
wrote
under
this
strange
influence
a
few
words
on
the
paper
which
she
handed
to
me
they
were
as
follows
i
am
here
question
me
leeuwenhoek
i
was
astounded
the
name
was
identical
with
that
i
had
written
beneath
the
table
and
carefully
kept
concealed
neither
was
it
at
all
probable
that
an
uncultivated
woman
like
vulpes
should
know
even
the
name
of
the
great
father
of
microscopies
it
may
have
been
biology
but
this
theory
was
soon
doomed
to
be
destroyed
i
wrote
on
my
slip
still
concealing
it
from
vulpes
a
series
of
questions
which
to
avoid
tediousness
i
shall
place
with
the
responses
in
the
order
in
which
they
occurred
can
the
microscope
be
brought
to
perfection
yes
am
i
destined
to
accomplish
this
great
task
you
are
i
wish
to
know
how
to
proceed
to
attain
this
end
for
the
love
which
you
bear
to
science
help
me
a
diamond
of
one
hundred
and
forty
carats
submitted
to
currents
for
a
long
period
will
experience
a
rearrangement
of
its
atoms
and
from
that
stone
you
will
form
the
universal
lens
will
great
discoveries
result
from
the
use
of
such
a
lens
so
great
that
all
that
has
gone
before
is
as
nothing
but
the
refractive
power
of
the
diamond
is
so
immense
that
the
image
will
be
formed
within
the
lens
how
is
that
difficulty
to
be
surmounted
pierce
the
lens
through
its
axis
and
the
difficulty
is
obviated
the
image
will
be
formed
in
the
pierced
space
which
will
itself
serve
as
a
tube
to
look
through
now
i
am
called
good
night
i
can
not
at
all
describe
the
effect
that
these
extraordinary
communications
had
upon
me
i
felt
completely
bewildered
no
biological
theory
could
account
for
the
of
the
lens
the
medium
might
by
means
of
biological
with
my
mind
have
gone
so
far
as
to
read
my
questions
and
reply
to
them
coherently
but
biology
could
not
enable
her
to
discover
that
magnetic
currents
would
so
alter
the
crystals
of
the
diamond
as
to
remedy
its
previous
defects
and
admit
of
its
being
polished
into
a
perfect
lens
some
such
theory
may
have
passed
through
my
head
it
is
true
but
if
so
i
had
forgotten
it
in
my
excited
condition
of
mind
there
was
no
course
left
but
to
become
a
convert
and
it
was
in
a
state
of
the
most
painful
nervous
exultation
that
i
left
the
medium
house
that
evening
she
accompanied
me
to
the
door
hoping
that
i
was
satisfied
the
raps
followed
us
as
we
went
through
the
hall
sounding
on
the
balusters
the
flooring
and
even
the
lintels
of
the
door
i
hastily
expressed
my
satisfaction
and
escaped
hurriedly
into
the
cool
night
air
i
walked
home
with
but
one
thought
possessing
me
how
to
obtain
a
diamond
of
the
immense
size
required
my
entire
means
multiplied
a
hundred
times
over
would
have
been
inadequate
to
its
purchase
besides
such
stones
are
rare
and
become
historical
i
could
find
such
only
in
the
regalia
of
eastern
or
european
monarchs
iv
the
eye
of
morning
there
was
a
light
in
simon
room
as
i
entered
my
house
a
vague
impulse
urged
me
to
visit
him
as
i
opened
the
door
of
his
unannounced
he
was
bending
with
his
back
toward
me
over
a
carcel
lamp
apparently
engaged
in
minutely
examining
some
object
which
he
held
in
his
hands
as
i
entered
he
started
suddenly
thrust
his
hand
into
his
breast
pocket
and
turned
to
me
with
a
face
crimson
with
confusion
what
i
cried
poring
over
the
miniature
of
some
fair
lady
well
do
blush
so
much
i
wo
ask
to
see
it
simon
laughed
awkwardly
enough
but
made
none
of
the
negative
protestations
usual
on
such
occasions
he
asked
me
to
take
a
seat
simon
said
i
i
have
just
come
from
madame
vulpes
this
time
simon
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
seemed
stupefied
as
if
a
sudden
electric
shock
had
smitten
him
he
babbled
some
incoherent
words
and
went
hastily
to
a
small
closet
where
he
usually
kept
his
liquors
although
astonished
at
his
emotion
i
was
too
preoccupied
with
my
own
idea
to
pay
much
attention
to
anything
else
you
say
truly
when
you
call
madame
vulpes
a
devil
of
a
woman
i
continued
simon
she
told
me
wonderful
things
tonight
or
rather
was
the
means
of
telling
me
wonderful
things
ah
if
i
could
only
get
a
diamond
that
weighed
one
hundred
and
forty
carats
scarcely
had
the
sigh
with
which
i
uttered
this
desire
died
upon
my
lips
when
simon
with
the
aspect
of
a
wild
beast
glared
at
me
savagely
and
rushing
to
the
where
some
foreign
weapons
hung
on
the
wall
caught
up
a
malay
creese
and
brandished
it
furiously
before
him
no
he
cried
in
french
into
which
he
always
broke
when
excited
no
you
shall
not
have
it
you
are
perfidious
you
have
consulted
with
that
demon
and
desire
my
treasure
but
i
will
die
first
me
i
am
brave
you
can
not
make
me
fear
all
this
uttered
in
a
loud
voice
trembling
with
excitement
astounded
me
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
i
had
accidentally
trodden
upon
the
edges
of
simon
secret
whatever
it
was
it
was
necessary
to
reassure
him
my
dear
simon
i
said
i
am
entirely
at
a
loss
to
know
what
you
mean
i
went
to
madame
vulpes
to
consult
with
her
on
a
scientific
problem
to
the
solution
of
which
i
discovered
that
a
diamond
of
the
size
i
just
mentioned
was
necessary
you
were
never
alluded
to
during
the
evening
nor
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
even
thought
of
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
this
outburst
if
you
happen
to
have
a
set
of
valuable
diamonds
in
your
possession
you
need
fear
nothing
from
me
the
diamond
which
i
require
you
could
not
possess
or
if
you
did
possess
it
you
would
not
be
living
here
something
in
my
tone
must
have
completely
reassured
him
for
his
expression
immediately
changed
to
a
sort
of
constrained
merriment
combined
however
with
a
certain
suspicious
attention
to
my
movements
he
laughed
and
said
that
i
must
bear
with
him
that
he
was
at
certain
moments
subject
to
a
species
of
vertigo
which
betrayed
itself
in
incoherent
speeches
and
that
the
attacks
passed
off
as
rapidly
as
they
came
he
put
his
weapon
aside
while
making
this
explanation
and
endeavored
with
some
success
to
assume
a
more
cheerful
air
all
this
did
not
impose
on
me
in
the
least
i
was
too
much
accustomed
to
analytical
labors
to
be
baffled
by
so
flimsy
a
veil
i
determined
to
probe
the
mystery
to
the
bottom
simon
i
said
gayly
let
us
forget
all
this
over
a
bottle
of
burgundy
i
have
a
case
of
lausseure
fragrant
with
the
odors
and
ruddy
with
the
sunlight
of
the
côte
let
us
have
up
a
couple
of
bottles
what
say
you
with
all
my
heart
answered
simon
smilingly
i
produced
the
wine
and
we
seated
ourselves
to
drink
it
was
of
a
famous
vintage
that
of
a
year
when
war
and
wine
throve
together
and
its
pure
but
powerful
juice
seemed
to
impart
renewed
vitality
to
the
system
by
the
time
we
had
half
finished
the
second
bottle
simon
head
which
i
knew
was
a
weak
one
had
begun
to
yield
while
i
remained
calm
as
ever
only
that
every
draught
seemed
to
send
a
flush
of
vigor
through
my
limbs
simon
utterance
became
more
and
more
indistinct
he
took
to
singing
french
of
a
not
very
moral
tendency
i
rose
suddenly
from
the
table
just
at
the
conclusion
of
one
of
those
incoherent
verses
and
fixing
my
eyes
on
him
with
a
quiet
smile
said
simon
i
have
deceived
you
i
learned
your
secret
this
evening
you
may
as
well
be
frank
with
me
vulpes
or
rather
one
of
her
spirits
told
me
all
he
started
with
horror
his
intoxication
seemed
for
the
moment
to
fade
away
and
he
made
a
movement
towards
the
weapon
that
he
had
a
short
time
before
laid
down
i
stopped
him
with
my
hand
monster
he
cried
passionately
i
am
ruined
what
shall
i
do
you
shall
never
have
it
i
swear
by
my
mother
i
do
want
it
i
said
rest
secure
but
be
frank
with
me
tell
me
all
about
it
the
drunkenness
began
to
return
he
protested
with
maudlin
earnestness
that
i
was
entirely
mistaken
that
i
was
intoxicated
then
asked
me
to
swear
eternal
secrecy
and
promised
to
disclose
the
mystery
to
me
i
pledged
myself
of
course
to
all
with
an
uneasy
look
in
his
eyes
and
hands
unsteady
with
drink
and
nervousness
he
drew
a
small
case
from
his
breast
and
opened
it
heavens
how
the
mild
was
shivered
into
a
thousand
prismatic
arrows
as
it
fell
upon
a
vast
that
glittered
in
the
case
i
was
no
judge
of
diamonds
but
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
this
was
a
gem
of
rare
size
and
purity
i
looked
at
simon
with
wonder
and
must
i
confess
it
with
envy
how
could
he
have
obtained
this
treasure
in
reply
to
my
questions
i
could
just
gather
from
his
drunken
statements
of
which
i
fancy
half
the
incoherence
was
affected
that
he
had
been
superintending
a
gang
of
slaves
engaged
in
in
brazil
that
he
had
seen
one
of
them
secrete
a
diamond
but
instead
of
informing
his
employers
had
quietly
watched
the
negro
until
he
saw
him
bury
his
treasure
that
he
had
dug
it
up
and
fled
with
it
but
that
as
yet
he
was
afraid
to
attempt
to
dispose
of
it
publicly
so
valuable
a
gem
being
almost
certain
to
attract
too
much
attention
to
its
owner
antecedents
and
he
had
not
been
able
to
discover
any
of
those
obscure
channels
by
which
such
matters
are
conveyed
away
safely
he
added
that
in
accordance
with
oriental
practice
he
had
named
his
diamond
by
the
fanciful
title
of
the
eye
of
morning
while
simon
was
relating
this
to
me
i
regarded
the
great
diamond
attentively
never
had
i
beheld
anything
so
beautiful
all
the
glories
of
light
ever
imagined
or
described
seemed
to
pulsate
in
its
crystalline
chambers
its
weight
as
i
learned
from
simon
was
exactly
one
hundred
and
forty
carats
here
was
an
amazing
coincidence
the
hand
of
destiny
seemed
in
it
on
the
very
evening
when
the
spirit
of
leeuwenhoek
communicates
to
me
the
great
secret
of
the
microscope
the
priceless
means
which
he
directs
me
to
employ
start
up
within
my
easy
reach
i
determined
with
the
most
perfect
deliberation
to
possess
myself
of
simon
diamond
i
sat
opposite
him
while
he
nodded
over
his
glass
and
calmly
revolved
the
whole
affair
i
did
not
for
an
instant
contemplate
so
foolish
an
act
as
a
common
theft
which
would
of
course
be
discovered
or
at
least
necessitate
flight
and
concealment
all
of
which
must
interfere
with
my
scientific
plans
there
was
but
one
step
to
be
taken
to
kill
simon
after
all
what
was
the
life
of
a
hide
peddling
jew
in
comparison
with
the
interests
of
science
human
beings
are
taken
every
day
from
the
condemned
prisons
to
be
experimented
on
by
surgeons
this
man
simon
was
by
his
own
confession
a
criminal
a
robber
and
i
believed
on
my
soul
a
murderer
he
deserved
death
quite
as
much
as
any
felon
condemned
by
the
laws
why
should
i
not
like
government
contrive
that
his
punishment
should
contribute
to
the
progress
of
human
knowledge
the
means
for
accomplishing
everything
i
desired
lay
within
my
reach
there
stood
upon
the
a
bottle
half
full
of
french
laudanum
simon
was
so
occupied
with
his
diamond
which
i
had
just
restored
to
him
that
it
was
an
affair
of
no
difficulty
to
drug
his
glass
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
was
in
a
profound
sleep
i
now
opened
his
waistcoat
took
the
diamond
from
the
inner
pocket
in
which
he
had
placed
it
and
removed
him
to
the
bed
on
which
i
laid
him
so
that
his
feet
hung
down
over
the
edge
i
had
possessed
myself
of
the
malay
creese
which
i
held
in
my
right
hand
while
with
the
other
i
discovered
as
accurately
as
i
could
by
pulsation
the
exact
locality
of
the
heart
it
was
essential
that
all
the
aspects
of
his
death
should
lead
to
the
surmise
of
i
calculated
the
exact
angle
at
which
it
was
probable
that
the
weapon
if
levelled
by
simon
own
hand
would
enter
his
breast
then
with
one
powerful
blow
i
thrust
it
up
to
the
hilt
in
the
very
spot
which
i
desired
to
penetrate
a
convulsive
thrill
ran
through
simon
limbs
i
heard
a
smothered
sound
issue
from
his
throat
precisely
like
the
bursting
of
a
large
sent
up
by
a
diver
when
it
reaches
the
surface
of
the
water
he
turned
half
round
on
his
side
and
as
if
to
assist
my
plans
more
effectually
his
right
hand
moved
by
some
more
spasmodic
impulse
clasped
the
handle
of
the
creese
which
it
remained
holding
with
extraordinary
muscular
tenacity
beyond
this
there
was
no
apparent
struggle
the
laudanum
i
presume
paralyzed
the
usual
nervous
action
he
must
have
died
instantaneously
there
was
yet
something
to
be
done
to
make
it
certain
that
all
suspicion
of
the
act
should
be
diverted
from
any
inhabitant
of
the
house
to
simon
himself
it
was
necessary
that
the
door
should
be
found
in
the
morning
on
the
how
to
do
this
and
afterwards
escape
myself
not
by
the
window
that
was
a
physical
impossibility
besides
i
was
determined
that
the
windows
also
should
he
found
bolted
the
solution
was
simple
enough
i
descended
softly
to
my
own
room
for
a
peculiar
instrument
which
i
had
used
for
holding
small
slippery
substances
such
as
minute
spheres
of
glass
etc
this
instrument
was
nothing
more
than
a
long
slender
with
a
very
powerful
grip
and
a
considerable
leverage
which
last
was
accidentally
owing
to
the
shape
of
the
handle
nothing
was
simpler
than
when
the
key
was
in
the
lock
to
seize
the
end
of
its
stem
in
this
vice
through
the
keyhole
from
the
outside
and
so
lock
the
door
previously
however
to
doing
this
i
burned
a
number
of
papers
on
simon
hearth
suicides
almost
always
burn
papers
before
they
destroy
themselves
i
also
emptied
some
more
laudanum
into
simon
glass
having
first
removed
from
it
all
traces
of
wine
cleaned
the
other
and
brought
the
bottles
away
with
me
if
traces
of
two
persons
drinking
had
been
found
in
the
room
the
question
naturally
would
have
arisen
who
was
the
second
besides
the
might
have
been
identified
as
belonging
to
me
the
laudanum
i
poured
out
to
account
for
its
presence
in
his
stomach
in
case
of
examination
the
theory
naturally
would
be
that
he
first
intended
to
poison
himself
but
after
swallowing
a
little
of
the
drug
was
either
disgusted
with
its
taste
or
changed
his
mind
from
other
motives
and
chose
the
dagger
these
arrangements
made
i
walked
out
leaving
the
gas
burning
locked
the
door
with
my
vice
and
went
to
bed
simon
death
was
not
discovered
until
nearly
three
in
the
afternoon
the
servant
astonished
at
seeing
the
gas
burning
the
light
streaming
on
the
dark
landing
from
under
the
door
peeped
through
the
keyhole
and
saw
simon
on
the
bed
she
gave
the
alarm
the
door
was
burst
open
and
the
neighborhood
was
in
a
fever
of
excitement
every
one
in
the
house
was
arrested
myself
included
there
was
an
inquest
but
no
clue
to
his
death
beyond
that
of
suicide
could
be
obtained
curiously
enough
he
had
made
several
speeches
to
his
friends
the
preceding
week
that
seemed
to
point
to
one
gentleman
swore
that
simon
had
said
in
his
presence
that
he
was
tired
of
life
his
landlord
affirmed
that
simon
when
paying
him
his
last
month
rent
remarked
that
he
would
not
pay
him
rent
much
longer
all
the
other
evidence
corresponded
the
door
locked
inside
the
position
of
the
corpse
the
burnt
papers
as
i
anticipated
no
one
knew
of
the
possession
of
the
diamond
by
simon
so
that
no
motive
was
suggested
for
his
murder
the
jury
after
a
prolonged
examination
brought
in
the
usual
verdict
and
the
neighborhood
once
more
settled
down
into
its
accustomed
quiet
animula
the
three
months
succeeding
simon
catastrophe
i
devoted
night
and
day
to
my
diamond
lens
i
had
constructed
a
vast
galvanic
battery
composed
of
nearly
two
thousand
pairs
of
plates
a
higher
power
i
dared
not
use
lest
the
diamond
should
be
calcined
by
means
of
this
enormous
engine
i
was
enabled
to
send
a
powerful
current
of
electricity
continually
through
my
great
diamond
which
it
seemed
to
me
gained
in
lustre
every
day
at
the
expiration
of
a
month
i
commenced
the
grinding
and
polishing
of
the
lens
a
work
of
intense
toil
and
exquisite
delicacy
the
great
density
of
the
stone
and
the
care
required
to
be
taken
with
the
curvatures
of
the
surfaces
of
the
lens
rendered
the
labor
the
severest
and
most
harassing
that
i
had
yet
undergone
at
last
the
eventful
moment
came
the
lens
was
completed
i
stood
trembling
on
the
threshold
of
new
worlds
i
had
the
realization
of
alexander
famous
wish
before
me
the
lens
lay
on
the
table
ready
to
be
placed
upon
its
platform
my
hand
fairly
shook
as
i
enveloped
a
drop
of
water
with
a
thin
coating
of
oil
of
turpentine
preparatory
to
its
examination
a
process
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
the
rapid
evaporation
of
the
water
i
now
placed
the
drop
on
a
thin
slip
of
glass
under
the
lens
and
throwing
upon
it
by
the
combined
aid
of
a
prism
and
a
mirror
a
powerful
stream
of
light
i
approached
my
eye
to
the
minute
hole
drilled
through
the
axis
of
the
lens
for
an
instant
i
saw
nothing
save
what
seemed
to
be
an
illuminated
chaos
a
vast
luminous
abyss
a
pure
white
light
cloudless
and
serene
and
seemingly
limitless
as
space
itself
was
my
first
impression
gently
and
with
the
greatest
care
i
depressed
the
lens
a
few
breadths
the
wondrous
illumination
still
continued
but
as
the
lens
approached
the
object
a
scene
of
indescribable
beauty
was
unfolded
to
my
view
i
seemed
to
gaze
upon
a
vast
space
the
limits
of
which
extended
far
beyond
my
vision
an
atmosphere
of
magical
luminousness
permeated
the
entire
field
of
view
i
was
amazed
to
see
no
trace
of
animalculous
life
not
a
living
thing
apparently
inhabited
that
dazzling
expanse
i
comprehended
instantly
that
by
the
wondrous
power
of
my
lens
i
had
penetrated
beyond
the
grosser
particles
of
aqueous
matter
beyond
the
realms
of
infusoria
and
protozoa
down
to
the
original
gaseous
globule
into
whose
luminous
interior
i
was
gazing
as
into
an
almost
boundless
dome
filled
with
a
supernatural
radiance
it
was
however
no
brilliant
void
into
which
i
looked
on
every
side
i
beheld
beautiful
inorganic
forms
of
unknown
texture
and
colored
with
the
most
enchanting
hues
these
forms
presented
the
appearance
of
what
might
be
called
for
want
of
a
more
specific
definition
foliated
clouds
of
the
highest
rarity
that
is
they
undulated
and
broke
into
vegetable
formations
and
were
tinged
with
splendors
compared
with
which
the
gilding
of
our
autumn
woodlands
is
as
dross
compared
with
gold
far
away
into
the
illimitable
distance
stretched
long
avenues
of
these
gaseous
forests
dimly
transparent
and
painted
with
prismatic
hues
of
unimaginable
brilliancy
the
pendent
branches
waved
along
the
fluid
glades
until
every
vista
seemed
to
break
through
ranks
of
drooping
silken
pennons
what
seemed
to
be
either
fruits
or
flowers
pied
with
a
thousand
hues
lustrous
and
ever
varying
bubbled
from
the
crowns
of
this
fairy
foliage
no
hills
no
lakes
no
rivers
no
forms
animate
or
inanimate
were
to
be
seen
save
those
vast
auroral
copses
that
floated
serenely
in
the
luminous
stillness
with
leaves
and
fruits
and
flowers
gleaming
with
unknown
fires
unrealizable
by
mere
imagination
how
strange
i
thought
that
this
sphere
should
be
thus
condemned
to
solitude
i
had
hoped
at
least
to
discover
some
new
form
of
animal
life
perhaps
of
a
lower
class
than
any
with
which
we
are
at
present
acquainted
but
still
some
living
organism
i
find
my
newly
discovered
world
if
i
may
so
speak
a
beautiful
chromatic
desert
while
i
was
speculating
on
the
singular
arrangements
of
the
internal
economy
of
nature
with
which
she
so
frequently
splinters
into
atoms
our
most
compact
theories
i
thought
i
beheld
a
form
moving
slowly
through
the
glades
of
one
of
the
prismatic
forests
i
looked
more
at
tentively
and
found
that
i
was
not
mistaken
words
can
not
depict
the
anxiety
with
which
i
awaited
the
nearer
approach
of
this
mysterious
object
was
it
merely
some
inanimate
substance
held
in
suspense
in
the
attenuated
atmosphere
of
the
globule
or
was
it
an
animal
endowed
with
vitality
and
motion
it
approached
flitting
behind
the
gauzy
colored
veils
of
for
seconds
dimly
revealed
then
vanishing
at
last
the
violet
pennons
that
trailed
nearest
to
me
vibrated
they
were
gently
pushed
aside
and
the
form
floated
out
into
the
broad
light
it
was
a
female
human
shape
when
i
say
human
i
mean
it
possessed
the
outlines
of
humanity
but
there
the
analogy
ends
its
adorable
beauty
lifted
it
inimitable
heights
beyond
the
loveliest
daughter
of
adam
i
can
not
i
dare
not
attempt
to
inventory
the
charms
of
this
divine
revelation
of
perfect
beauty
those
eyes
of
mystic
violet
dewy
and
serene
evade
my
words
her
long
lustrous
hair
following
her
glorious
head
in
a
golden
wake
like
the
track
sown
in
heaven
by
a
falling
star
seems
to
quench
my
most
burning
phrases
with
its
splendors
if
all
the
bees
of
hybla
nestled
upon
my
lips
they
would
still
sing
but
hoarsely
the
wondrous
harmonies
of
outline
that
enclosed
her
form
she
swept
out
from
between
the
of
the
into
the
broad
sea
of
light
that
lay
beyond
her
motions
were
those
of
some
graceful
naiad
cleaving
by
a
mere
effort
of
her
will
the
clear
unruffled
waters
that
fill
the
chambers
of
the
sea
she
floated
forth
with
the
serene
grace
of
a
frail
bubble
ascending
through
the
still
atmosphere
of
a
june
day
the
perfect
roundness
of
her
limbs
formed
suave
and
enchanting
curves
it
was
like
listening
to
the
most
spiritual
symphony
of
beethoven
the
divine
to
watch
the
harmonious
flow
of
lines
this
indeed
was
a
pleasure
cheaply
purchased
at
any
price
what
cared
i
if
i
had
waded
to
the
portal
of
this
wonder
through
another
blood
i
would
have
given
my
own
to
enjoy
one
such
moment
of
intoxication
and
delight
breathless
with
gazing
on
this
lovely
wonder
and
forgetful
for
an
instant
of
everything
save
her
presence
i
withdrew
my
eye
from
the
microscope
eagerly
alas
as
my
gaze
fell
on
the
thin
slide
that
lay
beneath
my
instrument
the
bright
light
from
mirror
and
from
prism
sparkled
on
a
colorless
drop
of
water
there
in
that
tiny
bead
of
dew
this
beautiful
being
was
forever
imprisoned
the
planet
neptune
was
not
more
distant
from
me
than
she
i
hastened
once
more
to
apply
my
eye
to
the
microscope
animula
let
me
now
call
her
by
that
dear
name
which
i
subsequently
bestowed
on
her
had
changed
her
position
she
had
again
approached
the
wondrous
forest
and
was
gazing
earnestly
upwards
presently
one
of
the
trees
as
i
must
call
them
unfolded
a
long
ciliary
process
with
which
it
seized
one
of
the
gleaming
fruits
that
glittered
on
its
summit
and
sweeping
slowly
down
held
it
within
reach
of
animula
the
sylph
took
it
in
her
delicate
hand
and
began
to
eat
my
attention
was
so
entirely
absorbed
by
her
that
i
could
not
apply
myself
to
the
task
of
determining
whether
this
singular
plant
was
or
was
not
instinct
with
volition
i
watched
her
as
she
made
her
repast
with
the
most
profound
attention
the
suppleness
of
her
motions
sent
a
thrill
of
delight
through
my
frame
my
heart
beat
madly
as
she
turned
her
beautiful
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
spot
in
which
i
stood
what
would
i
not
have
given
to
have
had
the
power
to
precipitate
myself
into
that
luminous
ocean
and
float
with
her
through
those
groves
of
purple
and
gold
while
i
was
thus
breathlessly
following
her
every
movement
she
suddenly
started
seemed
to
listen
for
a
moment
and
then
cleaving
the
brilliant
ether
in
which
she
was
floating
like
a
flash
of
light
pierced
through
the
opaline
forest
and
disappeared
instantly
a
series
of
the
most
singular
sensations
attacked
me
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
suddenly
gone
blind
the
luminous
sphere
was
still
before
me
but
my
daylight
had
vanished
what
caused
this
sudden
disappearance
had
she
a
lover
or
a
husband
yes
that
was
the
solution
some
signal
from
a
happy
had
vibrated
through
the
avenues
of
the
forest
and
she
had
obeyed
the
summons
the
agony
of
my
sensations
as
i
arrived
at
this
conclusion
startled
me
i
tried
to
reject
the
conviction
that
my
reason
forced
upon
me
i
battled
against
the
fatal
conclusion
but
in
vain
it
was
so
i
had
no
escape
from
it
i
loved
an
animalcule
it
is
true
that
thanks
to
the
marvellous
power
of
my
microscope
she
appeared
of
human
proportions
instead
of
presenting
the
revolting
aspect
of
the
coarser
creatures
that
live
and
struggle
and
die
in
the
more
easily
resolvable
portions
of
the
she
was
fair
and
delicate
and
of
surpassing
beauty
but
of
what
account
was
all
that
every
time
that
my
eye
was
withdrawn
from
the
instrument
it
fell
on
a
miserable
drop
of
water
within
which
i
must
be
content
to
know
dwelt
all
that
could
make
my
life
lovely
could
she
but
see
me
once
could
i
for
one
moment
pierce
the
mystical
walls
that
so
inexorably
rose
to
separate
us
and
whisper
all
that
filled
my
soul
i
might
consent
to
be
satisfied
for
the
rest
of
my
life
with
the
knowledge
of
her
remote
sympathy
it
would
be
something
to
have
established
even
the
faintest
personal
link
to
bind
us
together
to
know
that
at
times
when
roaming
through
those
enchanted
glades
she
might
think
of
the
wonderful
stranger
who
had
broken
the
monotony
of
her
life
with
his
presence
and
left
a
gentle
memory
in
her
heart
but
it
could
not
be
no
invention
of
which
human
intellect
was
capable
could
break
down
the
barriers
that
nature
had
erected
i
might
feast
my
soul
upon
her
wondrous
beauty
yet
she
must
always
remain
ignorant
of
the
adoring
eyes
that
day
and
night
gazed
upon
her
and
even
when
closed
beheld
her
in
dreams
with
a
bitter
cry
of
anguish
i
fled
from
the
room
and
flinging
myself
on
my
bed
sobbed
myself
to
sleep
like
a
child
vi
the
spilling
of
the
cup
i
arose
the
next
morning
almost
at
daybreak
and
rushed
to
my
microscope
i
trembled
as
i
sought
the
luminous
world
in
miniature
that
contained
my
all
animula
was
there
i
had
left
the
surrounded
by
its
moderator
burning
when
i
went
to
bed
the
night
before
i
found
the
sylph
bathing
as
it
were
with
an
expression
of
pleasure
animating
her
features
in
the
brilliant
light
which
surrounded
her
she
tossed
her
lustrous
golden
hair
over
her
shoulders
with
innocent
coquetry
she
lay
at
full
length
in
the
transparent
medium
in
which
she
supported
herself
with
ease
and
gambolled
with
the
enchanting
grace
that
the
nymph
salmacis
might
have
exhibited
when
she
sought
to
conquer
the
modest
hermaphroditus
i
tried
an
experiment
to
satisfy
myself
if
her
powers
of
reflection
were
developed
i
lessened
the
considerably
by
the
dim
light
that
remained
i
could
see
an
expression
of
pain
flit
across
her
face
she
looked
upward
suddenly
and
her
brows
contracted
i
flooded
the
stage
of
the
microscope
again
with
a
full
stream
of
light
and
her
whole
expression
changed
she
sprang
forward
like
some
substance
deprived
of
all
weight
her
eyes
sparkled
and
her
lips
moved
ah
if
science
had
only
the
means
of
conducting
and
reduplicating
sounds
as
it
does
the
rays
of
light
what
carols
of
happiness
would
then
have
entranced
my
ears
what
jubilant
hymns
to
adonaïs
would
have
thrilled
the
illumined
air
i
now
comprehended
how
it
was
that
the
count
de
gabalis
peopled
his
mystic
world
with
sylphs
beautiful
beings
whose
breath
of
life
was
lambent
fire
and
who
sported
forever
in
regions
of
purest
ether
and
purest
light
the
rosicrucian
had
anticipated
the
wonder
that
i
had
practically
realized
how
long
this
worship
of
my
strange
divinity
went
on
thus
i
scarcely
know
i
lost
all
note
of
time
all
day
from
early
dawn
and
far
into
the
night
i
was
to
be
found
peering
through
that
wonderful
lens
i
saw
no
one
went
nowhere
and
scarce
allowed
myself
sufficient
time
for
my
meals
my
whole
life
was
absorbed
in
contemplation
as
rapt
as
that
of
any
of
the
romish
saints
every
hour
that
i
gazed
upon
the
divine
form
strengthened
my
passion
a
passion
that
was
always
overshadowed
by
the
maddening
conviction
that
although
i
could
gaze
on
her
at
will
she
never
never
could
behold
me
at
length
i
grew
so
pale
and
emaciated
from
want
of
rest
and
continual
brooding
over
my
insane
love
and
its
cruel
conditions
that
i
determined
to
make
some
effort
to
wean
myself
from
it
come
i
said
this
is
at
best
but
a
fantasy
your
imagination
has
bestowed
on
animula
charms
which
in
reality
she
does
not
possess
seclusion
from
female
society
has
produced
this
morbid
condition
of
mind
compare
her
with
the
beautiful
women
of
your
own
world
and
this
false
enchantment
will
vanish
i
looked
over
the
newspapers
by
chance
there
i
beheld
the
advertisement
of
a
celebrated
danseuse
who
appeared
nightly
at
niblo
the
signorina
caradolce
had
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
beautiful
as
well
as
the
most
graceful
woman
in
the
world
i
instantly
dressed
and
went
to
the
theatre
the
curtain
drew
up
the
usual
of
fairies
in
white
muslin
were
standing
on
the
right
toe
around
the
enamelled
of
green
canvas
on
which
the
belated
prince
was
sleeping
suddenly
a
flute
is
heard
the
fairies
start
the
trees
open
the
fairies
all
stand
on
the
left
toe
and
the
queen
enters
it
was
the
signorina
she
bounded
forward
amid
thunders
of
applause
and
lighting
on
one
foot
remained
poised
in
air
heavens
was
this
the
great
enchantress
that
had
drawn
monarchs
at
her
those
heavy
muscular
limbs
those
thick
ankles
those
cavernous
eyes
that
stereotyped
smile
those
crudely
painted
checks
where
were
the
vermeil
blooms
the
liquid
expressive
eyes
the
harmonious
limbs
of
animula
the
signorina
danced
what
gross
discordant
movements
the
play
of
her
limbs
was
all
false
and
artificial
her
bounds
were
painful
athletic
efforts
her
poses
were
angular
and
distressed
the
eye
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
with
an
exclamation
of
disgust
that
drew
every
eye
upon
me
i
rose
from
my
seat
in
the
very
middle
of
the
signorina
and
abruptly
quitted
the
house
i
hastened
home
to
feast
my
eyes
once
more
on
the
lovely
form
of
my
sylph
i
felt
that
henceforth
to
combat
this
passion
would
be
impossible
i
applied
my
eye
to
the
lens
aninula
was
there
but
what
could
have
happened
some
terrible
change
seemed
to
have
taken
place
during
my
absence
some
secret
grief
seemed
to
cloud
the
lovely
features
of
her
i
gazed
upon
her
face
had
grown
thin
and
haggard
her
limbs
trailed
heavily
the
wondrous
lustre
of
her
golden
hair
had
faded
she
was
ill
ill
and
i
could
not
assist
her
i
believe
at
that
moment
i
would
have
gladly
forfeited
all
claims
to
my
human
birthright
if
i
could
only
have
been
dwarfed
to
the
size
of
an
animalcule
and
permitted
to
console
her
from
whom
fate
had
forever
divided
me
i
racked
my
brain
for
the
solution
of
this
mystery
what
was
it
that
afflicted
the
sylph
she
seemed
to
suffer
intense
pain
her
features
contracted
and
she
even
writhed
as
if
with
some
internal
agony
the
wondrous
forests
appeared
also
to
have
lost
half
their
beauty
their
hues
were
dim
and
in
some
places
faded
away
altogether
i
watched
animula
for
hours
with
a
breaking
heart
and
she
seemed
absolutely
to
wither
away
under
my
very
eye
suddenly
i
remembered
that
i
had
not
looked
at
the
for
several
days
in
fact
i
hated
to
see
it
for
it
reminded
me
of
the
natural
barrier
between
animula
and
myself
i
hurriedly
looked
down
on
the
stage
of
the
microscope
the
slide
was
still
there
but
great
heavens
the
had
vanished
the
awful
truth
burst
upon
me
it
had
evaporated
until
it
had
become
so
minute
as
to
be
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
i
had
been
gazing
on
its
last
atom
the
one
that
contained
animula
and
she
was
dying
i
rushed
again
to
the
front
of
the
lens
and
looked
through
alas
the
last
agony
had
seized
her
the
forests
had
all
melted
away
and
animula
lay
struggling
feebly
in
what
seemed
to
be
a
spot
of
dim
light
ah
the
sight
was
horrible
the
limbs
once
so
round
and
lovely
shrivelling
up
into
nothings
the
eyes
those
eyes
that
shone
like
heaven
being
quenched
into
black
dust
the
lustrous
golden
hair
now
lank
and
discolored
the
last
throe
came
i
beheld
that
final
struggle
of
the
blackening
form
and
i
fainted
when
i
awoke
out
of
a
trance
of
many
hours
i
found
myself
lying
amid
the
wreck
of
my
instrument
myself
as
shattered
in
mind
and
body
as
it
i
crawled
feebly
to
my
bed
from
which
i
did
not
rise
for
months
they
say
now
that
i
am
mad
but
they
are
mistaken
i
am
poor
for
i
have
neither
the
heart
nor
the
will
to
work
all
my
money
is
spent
and
i
live
on
charity
young
men
associations
that
love
a
joke
invite
me
to
lecture
on
optics
before
them
for
which
they
pay
me
and
laugh
at
me
while
i
lecture
linley
the
mad
microscopist
is
the
name
i
go
by
i
suppose
that
i
talk
incoherently
while
i
lecture
who
could
talk
sense
when
his
brain
is
haunted
by
such
ghastly
memories
while
ever
and
anon
among
the
shapes
of
death
i
behold
the
radiant
form
of
my
lost
animula
the
sculptor
funeral
amid
the
aisle
apart
there
stood
a
mourner
like
the
rest
and
while
the
solemn
rites
were
said
he
fashioned
into
verse
his
mood
that
would
not
be
repressed
why
did
they
bring
him
home
bright
jewel
set
in
lead
oh
bear
the
sculptor
back
to
rome
and
lay
him
with
the
mighty
dead
with
adonais
and
the
rest
of
all
the
young
and
good
and
fair
that
drew
the
milk
of
english
breast
and
their
last
sigh
in
latian
air
lay
him
with
raphael
unto
whom
was
granted
rome
most
lasting
tomb
for
many
a
lustre
many
an
aeon
he
might
sleep
well
in
the
panthéon
deep
in
the
sacred
city
womb
the
smoke
and
splendor
and
the
stir
of
rome
lay
him
diocletian
dome
blessed
saint
mary
of
the
angels
near
to
that
house
in
which
he
dwelt
house
that
to
many
seemed
a
home
so
much
with
him
they
loved
and
felt
we
were
his
guests
a
hundred
times
we
loved
him
for
his
genial
ways
he
gave
me
credit
for
my
rhymes
and
made
me
blush
with
praise
ah
there
be
many
histories
that
no
historian
writes
and
friendship
hath
its
mysteries
and
consecrated
nights
amid
the
busy
days
of
pain
wear
of
hand
and
tear
of
brain
weary
midnight
weary
morn
years
of
struggle
paid
with
scorn
yet
oft
amid
all
this
despair
long
rambles
in
the
autumn
days
appian
or
flaminian
ways
bright
moments
snatched
from
care
when
loose
as
buffaloes
on
the
wild
campagna
we
roved
and
dined
on
crust
and
curds
olives
thin
wine
and
thinner
birds
and
woke
the
echoes
of
divine
romagna
and
then
returning
late
after
long
knocking
at
the
lateran
gate
suppers
and
nights
of
gods
and
then
mornings
that
made
us
men
rare
nights
at
the
minerva
tavern
with
orvieto
from
the
cardinal
cavern
free
nights
but
fearless
and
without
reproof
for
bayard
word
ruled
beppo
roof
o

what
memories
awake
when
crawford
name
is
said
of
days
and
friends
for
whose
dear
sake
that
path
of
hades
unto
me
will
have
no
more
of
dread
than
his
own
orpheus
felt
seeking
eurydice
o
crawford
husband
father
brother
are
in
that
name
that
little
word
let
me
no
more
my
sorrow
smother
grief
stirs
me
and
i
must
be
stirred
o
death
thou
teacher
true
and
rough
full
oft
i
fear
that
we
have
erred
and
have
not
loved
enough
but
oh
ye
friends
this
side
of
acheron
who
cling
to
me
i
shall
not
know
my
love
till
ye
are
gone
and
i
am
gray
fair
women
with
your
loving
eyes
old
men
that
once
my
footsteps
led
sweet
children
much
as
all
i
prize
until
the
sacred
dust
of
death
be
shed
upon
each
dear
and
venerable
head
i
can
not
love
you
as
i
love
the
dead
but
now
the
natural
man
being
sown
we
can
more
lucidly
behold
the
spiritual
one
for
we
till
time
shall
end
full
visibly
shall
see
our
friend
in
all
his
hand
did
mould
that
worn
and
patient
hand
that
lies
so
cold
when
on
some
blessed
studious
day
to
my
loved
library
i
wend
my
way
amid
the
forms
that
give
the
gallery
grace
his
thought
in
that
pale
poet
i
shall
trace
keen
orpheus
with
his
eyes
fixed
deep
in
ruddy
hell
seeking
amid
those
lurid
skies
the
wife
he
loved
so
well
and
feel
that
still
therein
i
see
all
that
was
in
my
master
thought
and
in
that
constant
hand
wherewith
he
wrought
the
eternal
type
of
constancy
thou
marble
husband
might
there
be
more
of
flesh
and
blood
like
thee
or
if
in
music
festive
hall
i
come
to
cheat
me
of
my
care
amid
the
swell
the
dying
fall
his
genius
greets
me
there
o
man
of
bronze
thy
solemn
air
best
soother
of
a
troubled
brain
floods
me
with
memories
and
again
as
thou
visibly
to
men
beloved
musician
so
once
more
crawford
comes
back
that
did
thy
form
restore
well
let
him
pass
good
mourners
go
your
several
ways
he
needs
no
further
rite
nor
mass
nor
eulogy
who
best
could
praise
himself
in
marble
and
in
brass
yet
his
best
monument
did
raise
not
in
those
perishable
things
that
men
eternal
deem
the
pride
of
palaces
and
kings
but
in
such
works
as
must
avail
him
there
with
him
who
from
the
extreme
love
that
was
in
his
breast
said
come
all
ye
that
heavy
burdens
bear
and
i
will
give
you
rest
the
president
message
as
a
mere
literary
production
the
message
of
buchanan
is
so
superior
to
any
of
the
messages
of
his
immediate
predecessor
that
the
reader
naturally
expects
to
find
in
it
a
corresponding
superiority
of
sentiment
and
aim
when
we
meet
a
man
who
is
and
whose
external
demeanor
is
that
of
a
gentleman
we
are
prone
to
infer
that
he
is
also
a
man
of
upright
principles
and
honorable
feelings
but
we
are
very
often
mistaken
in
this
inference
the
nice
garment
proves
to
be
little
better
than
a
nice
disguise
and
the
robe
of
respectability
may
cover
the
heart
of
a
very
scurvy
fellow
buchanan
sentences
run
smoothly
enough
they
are
for
the
most
part
grammatical
the
tone
throughout
is
sedate
if
not
dignified
and
the
general
spirit
unambitious
and
moderate
but
the
doctrine
in
our
estimation
is
on
the
most
essential
point
atrocious
and
the
objects
which
are
sought
to
be
compassed
are
unworthy
of
the
man
the
office
the
country
and
the
age
we
refer
of
course
to
what
is
said
of
the
one
vital
question
with
us
now
the
question
of
slavery
in
kansas
but
before
proceeding
to
a
discussion
of
that
let
us
say
a
word
or
two
of
other
parts
of
this
important
document
the
president
introduces
as
the
first
of
his
topics
the
prevailing
money
pressure
which
he
treats
at
considerable
length
with
some
degree
of
truth
but
without
originality
or
comprehensiveness
of
view
he
profiles
to
inquire
into
the
causes
of
the
unfortunate
disasters
of
trade
and
into
the
remedies
which
may
be
devised
against
their
recurrence
but
on
neither
head
is
he
remarkably
profound
or
instructive
it
is
merely
reiterating
the
commonplaces
of
the
newspapers
to
talk
about
the
excessive
loans
and
issues
of
the
banks
and
to
ring
changes
of
phraseology
on
the
vices
of
speculation
and
all
the
world
is
as
familiar
with
all
that
as
the
president
can
be
and
scarcely
needed
a
reminder
on
either
score
what
we
wanted
of
the
head
of
the
nation
what
a
real
statesman
who
understood
his
subject
would
have
given
us
that
is
if
he
had
pretended
to
go
at
all
beyond
the
simple
statement
of
the
fact
of
commercial
revulsion
into
a
discussion
of
it
was
a
comprehensive
and
philosophic
analysis
of
all
the
causes
of
the
phenomenon
a
calm
and
careful
review
of
all
its
circumstances
and
a
rigid
deduction
of
broad
general
principles
from
an
adequate
study
of
the
entire
case
but
this
the
president
has
not
furnished
in
connecting
our
commercial
derangements
with
the
disorders
of
the
banking
system
he
has
unquestionably
struck
upon
a
great
and
fundamental
truth
but
it
is
merely
a
single
truth
and
he
strikes
it
in
rather
a
vague
and
random
way
in
considering
these
reverses
there
are
many
things
to
be
taken
into
account
besides
the
constitution
and
customs
whether
good
or
bad
of
our
american
banks
many
things
which
do
not
even
confine
themselves
to
this
continent
but
are
spread
over
the
greater
part
of
the
civilized
world
buchanan
is
still
lamer
in
his
suggestion
of
remedies
than
he
is
in
his
inquiry
after
causes
the
federal
government
he
thinks
can
do
little
or
nothing
in
the
premises
a
fatal
admission
at
the
outset
and
we
are
coolly
turned
over
to
the
most
unsubstantial
and
impracticable
of
all
reliances
the
wisdom
and
patriotism
of
the
state
legislatures
why
can
not
the
federal
government
do
anything
in
the
premises
the
president
tells
us
that
the
constitution
has
conferred
upon
congress
the
exclusive
right
to
coin
money
regulate
the
value
and
that
it
has
prohibited
the
states
from
issuing
bills
of
credit
which
phrase
if
it
mean
anything
means
making
and
the
inference
would
seem
to
be
inevitable
that
congress
has
a
sovereign
authority
and
power
over
the
whole
matter
it
may
moreover
touch
the
circulation
of
bills
by
means
of
its
indisputable
right
to
lay
a
upon
paper
and
gallatin
long
ago
recommended
the
exercise
of
this
power
as
an
effectual
method
of
restraining
the
emission
of
small
notes
upon
what
principle
then
can
the
president
assert
so
dictatorially
as
he
does
that
the
federal
government
is
concluded
from
action
if
the
excesses
of
the
state
banks
are
so
enormous
as
he
represents
and
so
perpetually
and
so
widely
disastrous
why
should
it
not
interpose
to
avert
the
fearful
evil
why
refer
us
for
relief
to
the
proceedings
of
different
legislative
bodies
no
three
of
which
probably
would
agree
upon
any
coherent
system
we
do
not
ourselves
say
that
congress
ought
to
interfere
and
undertake
by
main
force
to
regulate
the
currency
because
we
hold
to
other
and
as
we
think
better
methods
of
arriving
at
a
sound
and
stable
currency
but
from
the
of
the
president
and
with
his
views
of
the
efficiency
of
legislative
restrictions
upon
banks
we
do
not
see
how
he
could
consistently
avoid
recommending
the
instant
action
of
congress
on
the
heel
of
his
grandiloquent
description
of
the
evils
of
redundant
paper
money
evils
which
are
felt
all
over
the
country
it
is
a
lamentably
impotent
conclusion
to
say
after
all
we
do
much
to
help
it
yes
let
us
confide
piously
in
wisdom
and
patriotism
of
the
state
legislatures
which
are
almost
the
last
places
in
the
world
as
things
go
where
we
should
look
for
either
quality
not
being
able
to
do
anything
himself
however
what
does
he
urge
upon
the
wise
and
patriotic
state
legislatures
why
a
series
of
flimsy
restrictions
which
would
have
about
as
much
effect
in
preventing
the
tremendous
abuses
of
banking
which
he
himself
depicts
as
a
bit
of
filigree
would
have
in
restraining
the
expansion
of
steam
restrictions
restrictions
restrictions
as
if
that
method
of
correcting
the
evil
had
not
been
utterly
exploded
by
nearly
two
centuries
of
experience
buchanan
calls
himself
a
democrat
he
is
loud
in
his
protestations
of
respect
for
the
sagacity
the
and
the
virtue
of
the
people
his
political
school
takes
for
its
motto
the
adage
that
government
is
best
which
governs
least
his
party
if
he
does
not
purports
to
be
a
great
advocate
of
the
emancipation
of
trade
from
all
the
restraints
which
take
the
names
of
protections
tariffs
bounties
etc
etc
and
we
wonder
how
it
is
that
in
his
presumed
excursions
over
the
entire
domain
of
he
should
have
got
no
inkling
of
a
thought
as
to
the
benefits
of
in
banking
we
wonder
that
so
great
a
subject
could
be
dismissed
with
the
suggestion
of
a
few
petty
restraints
if
the
state
legislatures
remarks
the
president
summing
up
his
entire
thought
afford
us
a
real
specie
basis
for
our
circulation
by
increasing
the
denomination
of
first
to
twenty
and
afterwards
to
fifty
dollars
if
they
will
require
that
the
banks
shall
at
all
times
keep
on
hand
at
least
one
dollar
of
gold
and
silver
for
every
three
dollars
of
their
circulation
and
deposits
and
if
they
will
provide
by
a
enactment
which
nothing
can
arrest
that
the
moment
they
suspend
they
shall
go
into
liquidation
i
believe
that
such
provisions
with
a
weekly
publication
by
each
bank
of
a
statement
of
its
condition
would
go
far
to
secure
us
against
future
suspensions
of
specie
payments
singular
blindness
buchanan
lived
for
several
years
as
american
ambassador
in
england
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
while
there
he
used
his
eyes
and
possibly
his
brains
he
must
have
noticed
occasionally
at
least
in
his
walks
through
the
city
the
immense
marble
structure
in
threadneedle
street
known
as
the
bank
of
england
it
is
certain
that
he
has
read
the
history
of
that
bank
inasmuch
as
it
is
twice
or
thrice
alluded
to
in
his
message
he
can
not
be
ignorant
therefore
that
the
circulation
of
england
has
essentially
a
specie
basis
that
no
are
issued
there
for
less
than
the
amount
of
dollars
that
the
banks
at
all
times
keep
on
hand
one
dollar
of
gold
for
every
three
dollars
of
their
circulation
and
deposits
and
that
the
laws
of
bankruptcy
are
alike
rigid
in
regard
to
institutions
and
individuals
these
are
precisely
the
provisions
which
he
commends
to
the
adoption
of
wise
and
patriotic
state
legislatures
as
an
admirable
corrective
for
suspensions
yet
he
forgets
to
explain
to
us
how
it
happens
that
the
bank
of
england
to
which
they
are
all
applied
has
virtually
suspended
payment
six
times
in
the
course
of
its
existence
having
been
saved
from
open
dishonor
only
by
the
timely
assistance
of
the
government
while
the
trade
of
england
in
spite
of
the
staid
and
conservative
habits
of
the
people
is
quite
as
liable
to
those
terrific
called
revulsions
as
our
own
before
urging
his
restraints
the
president
ought
to
have
inquired
a
little
into
the
history
of
such
restraints
and
he
would
then
have
saved
himself
from
the
absurdity
of
patronizing
remedies
which
an
actual
trial
had
proved
ludicrously
inapt
and
inefficacious
with
regard
to
the
second
topic
of
the
message
our
foreign
relations
it
may
be
said
that
the
positions
assumed
are
frank
manly
and
explicit
unless
we
have
reason
to
suspect
in
the
slightly
belligerent
attitude
towards
spain
a
return
on
the
part
of
the
president
to
one
of
his
old
and
unlawful
loves
the
acquisition
of
cuba
in
that
case
we
should
deplore
his
language
and
be
inclined
to
doubt
also
the
sincerity
of
his
just
denunciations
of
walker
infamous
schemes
of
piracy
and
brigandage
until
events
however
have
developed
the
signs
of
a
sinister
policy
of
this
sort
we
must
bestow
an
earnest
plaudit
upon
his
decided
rebuke
of
the
filibusters
coupling
that
praise
with
a
wish
that
the
vigilance
of
his
subordinates
may
hereafter
prove
of
a
more
and
energetic
kind
than
has
yet
been
manifested
but
for
the
terms
in
which
the
president
has
disposed
of
his
third
topic
the
kansas
difficulty
we
can
scarcely
characterize
their
disingenuousness
and
meanings
we
have
already
spoken
of
the
object
of
this
part
of
the
document
as
atrocious
and
we
repeat
the
word
as
the
most
befitting
that
could
be
used
that
object
is
nothing
less
than
an
attempt
to
cover
the
enormous
frauds
which
have
marked
the
proceedings
of
the
agents
in
kansas
from
their
initiation
with
a
varnish
of
smooth
and
plausible
pretexts
adroitly
taking
up
the
question
at
the
point
which
it
had
reached
when
his
own
administration
began
he
leaves
out
of
view
all
the
antecedent
crimes
treacheries
and
tricks
by
which
the
people
of
the
territory
had
been
led
into
civil
war
and
thus
assumes
that
the
late
lecompton
convention
was
a
legitimate
convention
and
that
the
constitution
framed
by
it
or
said
to
have
been
framed
by
it
for
there
is
no
official
report
of
the
instrument
as
yet
was
framed
in
pursuance
of
proper
authority
or
law
he
does
not
tell
us
that
the
territorial
legislature
which
called
this
convention
was
a
usurping
legislature
brought
together
as
the
congressional
records
show
by
an
invading
horde
from
a
neighboring
state
he
does
not
tell
us
that
even
if
it
had
been
a
properly
constituted
body
in
itself
it
had
no
right
to
call
a
convention
for
the
purpose
of
superseding
the
territorial
organization
he
does
not
tell
us
that
the
convention
as
assembled
represented
but
of
the
legal
voters
of
the
territory
nor
does
he
seem
to
regard
the
fact
that
the
other
of
the
people
were
virtually
disfranchised
by
that
convention
so
far
as
their
right
to
determine
the
provisions
of
their
organic
law
is
concerned
as
at
all
a
vital
and
important
fact
by
a
miserable
juggle
worthy
of
the
frequenters
of
the
or
the
the
people
of
kansas
have
been
nominally
allowed
to
decide
the
question
of
slavery
and
that
permission
according
to
buchanan
fulfils
and
completes
all
that
he
ever
meant
or
his
associates
ever
meant
by
the
promise
of
popular
sovereignty
now
this
may
be
all
that
the
president
and
his
party
ever
meant
by
that
phrase
but
it
is
not
all
that
their
words
expressed
or
the
country
expected
in
the
course
of
the
last
three
or
four
years
and
by
a
series
of
measures
the
established
principles
of
the
federal
government
in
regard
to
its
management
of
the
territories
principles
sanctioned
by
every
administration
from
washington
down
to
fillmore
have
been
overruled
for
the
sake
of
a
new
doctrine
which
goes
by
the
name
of
popular
sovereignty
the
most
sacred
and
binding
compacts
of
former
years
were
annulled
to
make
way
for
it
and
the
judicial
department
of
the
government
was
violently
hauled
from
its
sacred
retreat
into
the
political
arena
to
give
a
gratuitous
to
the
old
opinions
and
the
apparent
sanction
of
law
to
the
new
dogma
so
that
popular
sovereignty
might
reign
triumphant
in
the
territories
at
the
convention
of
the
party
which
nominated
buchanan
as
a
candidate
for
his
present
office
a
celebrated
occasion
as
he
calls
it
the
members
affirmed
in
the
most
emphatic
manner
the
right
of
the
people
of
all
the
territories
including
kansas
to
form
their
own
constitutions
as
they
pleased
under
the
single
condition
that
it
should
be
republican
buchanan
reiterated
that
assertion
in
his
inaugural
address
and
in
subsequent
communications
when
he
appointed
robert
walker
governor
of
the
territory
he
instructed
him
to
assure
the
people
that
they
should
be
guarantied
against
all
fraud
or
violence
when
they
should
be
called
upon
to
vote
for
or
against
the
constitution
which
would
be
submitted
to
them
so
that
there
might
be
a
fair
expression
of
the
popular
will
nothing
in
short
could
have
been
clearer
more
direct
more
frequently
repeated
than
the
asseverations
of
the
democratic
party
made
through
its
official
representatives
its
newspapers
and
its
orators
to
the
effect
that
its
only
object
in
its
kansas
policy
was
to
secure
the
great
principle
of
popular
sovereignty
on
the
strength
of
these
assurances
alone
it
was
enabled
to
achieve
its
victory
in
the
last
presidential
campaign
buchanan
owes
his
position
to
them
as
is
repeatedly
admitted
by
douglas
in
his
speech
of
december
last
and
the
whole
nation
having
discussed
and
battled
and
voted
on
the
principle
acquiesced
as
it
is
accustomed
to
do
after
an
election
in
the
ascendency
of
the
victors
it
prepared
itself
to
see
the
application
of
the
principle
which
had
been
announced
and
defended
as
so
important
and
wise
under
these
pledges
and
promises
what
has
been
the
performance
a
convention
for
which
inasmuch
as
it
was
illegally
called
by
an
illegal
body
a
large
proportion
of
the
citizens
of
kansas
refused
to
vote
frames
a
constitution
in
the
interest
and
according
to
the
convictions
of
the
slenderest
minority
of
the
people
it
incorporates
in
that
constitution
a
recognition
of
old
territorial
laws
to
the
last
degree
offensive
to
the
majority
of
the
people
it
incorporates
in
it
a
clause
establishing
slavery
in
perpetuity
it
connects
with
it
a
schedule
perpetuating
the
existing
slavery
whatever
it
may
be
against
all
future
remedy
which
has
not
the
sanction
of
the
and
then
by
a
miserable
chicane
it
submits
the
constitution
to
a
vote
of
the
people
but
it
submits
it
under
such
terms
that
the
people
if
they
vote
at
all
must
vote
it
whether
they
like
it
or
not
while
the
only
part
in
which
they
can
exercise
any
choice
is
the
which
relates
to
future
slavery
the
other
parts
especially
the
schedule
which
recognizes
the
existing
slavery
and
that
almost
irremediably
the
people
are
not
allowed
to
pronounce
upon
they
are
not
allowed
to
pronounce
upon
the
details
of
the
state
organization
they
are
fobbed
off
with
a
transparent
cheat
of
heads
i
win
tails
you
lose
and
the
whole
game
is
denominated
popular
sovereignty
what
is
worse
the
president
of
the
united
states
argues
that
this
would
be
a
fair
settlement
of
the
question
and
that
in
the
exercise
of
such
a
choice
the
glorious
doctrine
of
popular
sovereignty
is
amply
applied
and
vindicated
he
admits
that
the
correct
principle
as
in
the
case
of
minnesota
is
to
refer
the
constitution
to
the
approval
and
ratification
of
the
people
he
admits
that
the
only
mode
in
which
the
will
of
the
people
can
be
authentically
ascertained
is
by
a
direct
vote
he
admits
that
the
friends
and
supporters
of
the
act
when
struggling
to
sustain
its
provisions
before
the
great
tribunal
of
the
american
people
everywhere
throughout
the
union
publicly
pledged
their
faith
and
honor
to
submit
the
question
of
their
domestic
institutions
to
the
decision
of
the
people
of
kansas
without
any
qualification
or
restriction
whatever
but
then
and
here
is
the
subterfuge
domestic
institutions
means
only
the
single
institution
of
slavery
and
the
convention
in
consenting
to
yield
and
this
only
in
appearance
to
the
arbitrament
of
the
people
has
fully
satisfied
all
the
demands
of
the
principle
of
popular
sovereignty
their
other
questions
are
all
political
the
questions
as
to
the
organization
of
their
executive
legislative
and
judicial
departments
as
to
their
elective
franchise
their
distribution
of
districts
their
banks
their
rates
and
modes
of
taxation
are
not
domestic
questions
but
political
and
provided
the
people
are
suffered
to
vote
on
the
future
not
the
existing
condition
of
slaves
faith
has
been
sufficiently
kept
popular
sovereignty
means
pertaining
to
negroes
not
the
negroes
already
in
the
territory
but
those
who
may
be
hereafter
introduced
for
the
monopoly
of
that
branch
of
trade
and
merchandise
which
is
already
established
and
the
future
growth
and
increase
of
it
must
not
be
interfered
with
even
by
popular
sovereignty
because
that
would
be
an
act
of
gross
injustice
in
other
words
popular
sovereignty
is
merely
designed
to
cover
the
right
of
the
people
to
vote
on
a
single
question
specially
presented
by
an
illegal
body
under
electoral
arrangements
made
by
its
new
officers
which
officers
not
only
receive
but
count
the
votes
and
make
the
returns
while
all
the
rest
is
merely
unimportant
and
trivial
it
is
just
the
sort
of
sovereignty
for
which
louis
napoleon
provided
when
he
wished
to
procure
a
popular
sanction
for
the
numberless
atrocities
of
the
of
the
december
an
old
authority
tells
us
that
it
is
hard
to
kick
against
the
pricks
and
the
president
appears
to
have
experienced
the
difficulty
in
kicking
against
the
pricks
of
his
conscience
he
had
committed
himself
to
a
principle
which
he
is
now
compelled
by
the
policy
of
his
southern
masters
to
evade
and
is
painfully
embarrassed
as
to
how
he
shall
hide
his
tracks
he
knows
as
all
the
world
knows
that
this
jugglery
in
kansas
has
been
performed
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
secure
a
foothold
for
slavery
there
against
the
demonstrated
opinion
of
of
the
people
he
knows
as
all
the
world
knows
that
if
the
convention
had
had
the
least
desire
to
arrive
at
a
fair
expression
of
the
popular
will
on
the
question
of
slavery
or
any
other
question
it
was
easy
to
make
a
candid
and
honorable
submission
of
it
to
an
election
to
be
held
honestly
under
the
recognized
officers
of
the
territory
but
he
knows
also
that
under
such
circumstances
the
case
would
have
been
carried
overwhelmingly
against
the
domestic
institution
and
thus
have
rebuked
with
all
the
emphasis
that
an
outraged
community
could
give
to
the
expression
of
its
will
the
nefarious
conduct
which
the
party
has
pursued
from
the
beginning
and
this
was
a
consummation
not
to
be
wished
he
therefore
wriggles
and
shuffles
with
an
absurd
and
transparent
inconsistency
to
defeat
the
popular
will
and
yet
mouth
it
bravely
about
the
great
principle
of
popular
sovereignty
the
president
thinks
that
it
is
time
that
these
troubles
in
kansas
were
at
an
end
and
we
cordially
agree
with
him
in
the
sentiment
but
he
needs
scarcely
to
be
reminded
that
they
never
will
be
at
an
end
until
the
wicked
schemes
which
have
been
so
long
persisted
in
to
override
the
convictions
and
hopes
and
interests
of
a
large
majority
of
the
kansas
settlers
are
utterly
abandoned
by
those
who
are
in
power
of
the
remaining
and
mostly
routine
topics
of
the
message
we
have
no
occasion
to
speak
and
we
only
regret
that
the
deficiencies
of
the
most
important
parts
are
so
glaring
as
to
oblige
us
to
treat
them
with
undisguised
severity

london
this
work
has
a
double
claim
to
attention
in
america
first
on
account
of
its
great
intrinsic
merit
as
a
narrative
of
the
beginnings
of
the
european
settlement
of
this
continent
secondly
as
containing
a
thorough
and
exceedingly
able
account
of
the
planting
of
slavery
in
america
and
the
origin
of
that
system
which
has
been
and
is
the
great
blight
of
the
civilization
of
the
new
world
mr
helps
is
endowed
in
large
measure
with
the
qualities
of
an
historian
of
the
highest
order
a
clear
and
comprehensive
vision
a
wide
knowledge
and
careful
study
of
human
nature
free
and
generous
sympathies
are
united
in
him
with
a
penetrative
imagination
which
vivifies
the
life
of
past
times
with
a
reverence
for
truth
which
excludes
prejudice
and
prepossession
and
with
a
profoundly
religious
spirit
the
tone
of
his
thought
is
manly
and
vigorous
and
his
style
with
the
beauty
of
which
the
readers
of
his
essays
have
long
been
familiar
is
marked
by
quiet
grace
and
unpretending
strength
there
are
many
passages
in
these
volumes
of
wise
reflection
and
of
pleasant
humor
in
the
drawing
of
character
and
in
the
narration
of
events
mr
helps
is
equally
happy
the
pages
of
his
book
are
full
of
lifelike
portraits
of
the
great
soldiers
and
great
priests
of
the
time
and
of
animated
pictures
of
the
scenes
in
which
they
were
engaged
mr
helps
has
investigated
his
subject
with
zeal
industry
and
patience
he
has
sought
out
the
original
authorities
has
brought
to
light
many
important
facts
has
redeemed
some
great
memories
from
unjust
oblivion
and
has
presented
a
new
view
of
several
of
the
chief
features
of
the
history
in
a
graceful
advertisement
to
the
third
volume
he
says
the
reader
will
observe
that
there
is
scarcely
any
allusion
in
this
work
to
the
kindred
works
of
modern
writers
on
the
same
subject
this
is
not
from
any
want
of
respect
for
the
able
historians
who
have
written
upon
the
discovery
or
the
conquest
of
america
i
felt
however
from
the
first
that
my
object
in
investigating
this
portion
of
history
was
different
from
theirs
and
i
wished
to
keep
my
mind
clear
from
the
influence
which
these
eminent
persons
might
have
exercised
upon
it
a
considerable
space
in
these
volumes
is
devoted
to
an
investigation
of
the
character
and
condition
of
the
native
races
of
the
continent
at
the
period
of
the
spanish
conquest
this
subject
is
treated
with
peculiar
skill
and
learning
and
with
unusual
power
of
sympathetic
analysis
and
appreciation
of
remote
and
obscure
developments
of
society
another
portion
of
the
history
which
his
plan
has
led
mr
helps
to
treat
at
length
and
with
exhaustive
thoroughness
is
the
early
relations
between
the
conquerors
and
the
conquered
embracing
the
method
of
settlement
of
the
different
countries
the
whole
disastrous
system
of
and
which
in
its
full
development
led
to
the
destruction
of
the
native
population
of
hispaniola
and
to
the
introduction
of
negroes
into
this
and
the
other
west
india
islands
to
supply
the
demand
for
laborers
another
most
interesting
portion
of
his
subject
and
one
which
has
never
till
now
been
fairly
exhibited
relates
to
the
labors
of
the
dominican
and
franciscan
monks
and
their
admirable
and
unwearied
efforts
to
counteract
and
to
remedy
some
of
the
bitterest
evils
of
the
conquest
theirs
were
the
first
protests
that
were
raised
against
slavery
in
america
and
their
ranks
afforded
the
first
martyrs
in
the
cause
of
the
indian
and
the
negro
las
casas
has
found
an
eloquent
and
just
biographer
and
mr
helps
has
the
satisfaction
of
having
securely
placed
his
name
among
the
few
that
deserve
the
lasting
honor
and
remembrance
of
the
world
the
narrative
of
las
casas
life
is
one
of
strong
dramatic
interest
his
life
was
a
varied
and
remarkable
one
even
for
those
times
of
striking
contrasts
and
varieties
in
the
fortunes
of
men
and
in
mr
helps
pages
one
sees
the
man
himself
with
his
simplicity
and
elevation
of
purpose
his
honesty
of
motive
his
energy
his
impetuosity
his
courage
and
his
faith
the
three
volumes
already
published
embrace
the
progress
of
spanish
conquest
from
the
first
discoveries
of
columbus
to
incursion
into
peru
it
is
sincerely
to
be
hoped
that
mr
helps
may
continue
his
work
at
least
to
the
period
when
the
spanish
conquest
and
colonization
were
met
and
limited
by
the
conquest
and
the
colonization
of
the
other
european
nations
its
importance
as
a
wise
thoughtful
unpolemic
investigation
of
the
origin
and
the
results
of
slavery
is
hardly
to
be
overestimated
the
space
allowed
to
a
critical
notice
does
not
permit
us
to
render
it
full
justice
we
can
do
little
more
than
recommend
it
warmly
to
the
readers
of
history
and
to
the
students
of
the
most
difficult
and
the
darkest
social
problem
of
the
age
of
railroad
construction
for
the
use
of
american
engineers
containing
the
necessary
rules
tables
and
formulae
for
the
location
construction
equipment
and
management
of
railroads
as
built

mo
pp
all
who
trust
their
persons
to
railroad
cars
or
their
estates
to
railroad
stocks
will
welcome
every
effort
to
enlighten
that
irresponsible
body
of
railroad
builders
and
managers
in
whose
wits
we
put
our
faith
the
work
which
we
here
notice
is
intended
for
uneducated
american
engineers
of
whom
there
are
unfortunately
too
many
the
rapidity
with
which
our
railroads
have
been
built
and
the
experimental
character
of
this
new
branch
of
engineering
have
obliged
us
to
resort
to
such
native
ability
and
mother
wit
as
our
people
could
afford
the
great
body
of
our
railroad
engineers
have
had
no
training
but
the
experience
they
have
blundered
through
and
even
our
railroad
financiers
are
men
more
distinguished
for
courage
and
energy
than
for
experimental
skill
vose
book
will
doubtless
be
of
great
service
in
remedying
these
evils
by
bringing
within
the
reach
of
every
intelligent
man
a
valuable
and
very
carefully
prepared
summary
of
such
rules
formulas
and
statistics
as
our
railroad
experiences
have
furnished
and
proved
railroad
engineering
and
management
have
united
almost
every
branch
of
mechanical
and
financial
science
and
have
developed
several
new
and
peculiar
arts
so
that
the
successful
construction
equipment
and
management
of
a
railroad
require
a
rare
combination
of
accomplishments
managers
hitherto
have
been
too
little
acquainted
with
their
business
to
settle
many
questions
of
economy
but
they
are
now
beginning
to
look
upon
their
enterprises
with
cooler
judgments
the
handbook
discusses
several
questions
of
economy
but
seeks
especially
in
its
rules
and
formulas
to
avoid
those
risks
by
which
economy
has
often
been
turned
into
the
most
ruinous
extravagance
on
the
question
of
fuel
our
author
advocates
the
use
of
coke
as
the
most
economical
and
convenient
and
every
way
preferable
where
it
can
be
readily
obtained
he
also
urges
on
economical
grounds
a
more
moderate
rate
of
speed
in
railroad
travel
thus
showing
that
we
may
save
our
forests
our
lives
and
a
considerable
expense
all
at
the
same
time
the
style
is
clear
and
for
a
work
not
professing
to
be
a
complete
treatise
but
only
a
manual
of
useful
facts
the
arrangement
is
admirable
the
book
is
thoroughly
practical
and
touches
upon
such
matters
and
for
the
most
part
upon
such
matters
only
as
are
likely
to
be
of
service
to
the
practical
man
yet
it
is
quite
elementary
in
its
character
and
free
from
unnecessary
technicalities
the
book
has
however
one
great
fault
it
is
full
of
errata
no
carefully
prepared
table
of
corrections
can
make
amends
for
such
a
fault
in
a
book
in
which
typographical
correctness
is
of
the
greatest
importance
to
insert
in
their
places
with
a
pen
more
than
two
hundred
published
corrections
is
a
labor
which
no
reader
would
willingly
undertake
we
hope
therefore
that
a
new
and
correct
edition
will
soon
be
published

it
is
a
remarkable
fact
and
one
not
very
creditable
to
the
musical
public
of
england
that
the
works
of

hawkins
barney
and

should
remain
for
almost
an
entire
century
after

concerning

and
that

that

correcting
the
errors
reconciling
the
contradictions
and
supplying
the
deficiencies
of
those
authors

be
from
the
pen
of
a
french
exile
and
yet
during
all
this
time
materials
have
been
accumulating
the
fame
of
the
composer
has
been
extending
the
demand
for
such
a
work
increasing
and
the
number
of
intelligent
and
elegant
english
writers
upon
music
growing
greater
schoelcher
work
though
perhaps
the
most
valuable
contribution
to
musical
historical
literature
which
has
for
many
years
appeared
from
the
english
press
leaves
much
to
be
desired
excepting
a
correction
of
the
chronology
of
handel
visit
to
italy
very
little
if
anything
of
importance
is
added
to
what
we
already
possessed
in
regard
to
the
early
history
of
the
composer
we
look
in
vain
for
the
means
of
tracing
the
development
of
his
genius
the
impression
left
upon
the
mind
of
the
reader
is
that
his
powers
showed
themselves
suddenly
in
full
splendor
and
that
at
a
single
bound
he
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
the
dramatic
composers
of
his
age
this
was
not
true
of
hasse
mozart
gluck
cherubini
weber
in
dramatic
composition
nor
of
bach
haydn
beethoven
in
other
branches
of
the
musical
art
however
great
a
man
genius
may
be
he
must
live
and
learn
to
attain
the
highest
excellence
long
continued
study
is
necessary
and
handel
as
we
believe
was
no
exception
to
the
general
law
the
list
of
works
consulted
by
schoelcher
prefixed
to
the
biography
shows
that
he
has
by
no
means
exhausted
the
german
authorities
which
may
be
profitably
used
in
writing
upon
the
early
history
of
handel
indeed
the
author
though
of
german
descent
is
unacquainted
with
the
german
language
we
can
learn
from
them
the
state
of
dramatic
music
at
that
time
in
berlin
leipsic
brunswick
hanover
köthen
we
can
form
from
them
some
correct
idea
of
the
powers
of
keiser
steffani
graupner
schieferdecker
telemann
grünwald
and
others
then
in
possession
of
the
lyric
stage
we
can
thus
estimate
the
influences
which
led
handel
from
the
path
that
bach
so
successfully
followed
into
that
which
he
pursued
with
equal
success
and
though
the
amount
of
matter
relating
to
him
personally
be
small
much
that
throws
light
upon
his
early
life
still
remains
inaccessible
to
the
english
reader
the
biography
of
a
great
creative
artist
must
in
great
measure
consist
of
a
history
of
his
works
and
the
great
value
of
the
book
before
us
arises
from
the
searching
examination
to
which
schoelcher
has
subjected
the
several
collections
of
manuscripts
which
are
preserved
in
england
one
of
which
in
some
respects
the
most
valuable
has
fallen
into
his
own
possession
this
examination
for
the
first
time
made
together
with
the
first
careful
and
thorough
search
for
whatever
might
afford
a
ray
of
light
in
the
various
periodicals
of
handel
time
has
enabled
the
author
to
correct
innumerable
errors
in
previous
writers
and
trace
step
by
step
the
rapid
succession
of
opera
anthem
serenata
and
oratorio
which
filled
the
years
of
the
composer
manhood
for
the
general
reader
perhaps
schoelcher
has
been
drawn
too
far
into
detail
and
some
passages
of
his
work
might
have
been
better
reserved
for
his
catalogue
of
handel
works
but
these
details
are
of
the
highest
value
to
the
student
of
musical
literature
and
indeed
form
for
him
the
principal
charm
of
the
work
the
importance
of
the
author
labors
can
be
duly
appreciated
only
by
those
who
have
had
occasion
to
study
somewhat
extensively
the
musical
history
of
the
last
century
for
them
the
results
of
those
labors
as
here
presented
are
invaluable

there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
merit
of
these
sermons
considered
as
examples
of
method
and
embodiments
of
character
whatever
elements
of
christianity
may
be
left
unexpressed
in
them
it
is
certain
that
spurgeon
has
succeeded
in
expressing
himself
his
discourses
at
least
give
us
christianity
as
he
understands
feels
and
lives
it
they
should
be
studied
by
all
clergymen
who
desire
to
master
the
secret
of
influencing
masses
of
men
they
will
afford
valuable
hints
in
respect
to
method
even
when
their
spirit
tone
and
teaching
present
no
proper
model
for
imitation
spurgeon
we
suppose
would
be
classed
among
calvinists
but
he
is
not
merely
that
without
any
force
depth
amplitude
or
originality
of
thought
he
has
considerable
force
and
originality
of
nature
he
detaches
from
their
relations
certain
doctrines
of
calvinism
which
especially
interest
him
and
so
emphasizes
and
intensifies
them
so
blends
them
with
his
personal
being
and
experience
that
the
impression
he
stamps
upon
the
mind
is
rather
of
spurgeonism
than
calvinism
he
gives
vivid
reality
to
his
doctrines
because
they
are
incorporated
with
his
nature
and
not
merely
with
his
spiritual
but
with
his
animal
nature
he
is
thoroughly
in
earnest
from
the
fact
that
he
preaches
himself
his
converts
therefore
are
likely
to
mistake
being
spurgeonized
for
being
christianized
for
the
christianity
he
preaches
is
not
so
much
vital
christianity
as
it
is
christianity
passed
through
the
vitalities
of
his
own
nature
and
essentially
modified
and
lowered
in
the
process
to
understand
then
the
kind
of
influence
he
exerts
we
have
simply
to
inquire
what
kind
of
man
is
spurgeon
the
answer
to
this
question
is
given
on
every
page
of
his
sermons
he
has
no
reserves
but
lets
his
character
transpire
in
every
sentence
he
is
a
bold
eager
earnest
devout
passionate
man
with
considerable
experience
in
the
sphere
of
the
religious
emotions
full
of
sympathy
with
rough
natures
full
of
mother
wit
and
practical
sagacity
but
as
a
theologian
coarse
ignorant
and
strikingly
deficient
in
fine
spiritual
perceptions
these
qualities
inhere
in
a
nature
of
singular
vigor
intensity
and
directness
that
sends
out
words
like
bullets
warmth
of
feeling
combined
with
narrowness
of
mind
makes
him
a
bigot
but
his
bigotry
is
not
the
sour
assertion
of
an
opinion
but
the
racy
utterance
of
a
nature
he
believes
in
spurgeonism
so
thoroughly
and
so
simply
that
toleration
is
out
of
the
question
and
doctrines
opposed
to
his
own
he
refers
with
instantaneous
and
ingenuous
dogmatism
to
folly
or
wickedness
i
think
he
says
in
one
of
his
sermons
i
have
none
here
so
profoundly
stupid
as
to
be
puseyites
i
can
scarcely
believe
that
i
have
been
the
means
of
attracting
one
person
here
so
utterly
devoid
of
one
remnant
of
brain
as
to
believe
the
doctrine
of
baptismal
regeneration
the
doctrine
indeed
is
so
nonsensical
to
him
that
after
some
caricatures
of
it
he
asserts
that
it
would
discredit
scripture
with
all
sensible
men
if
it
were
taught
in
scripture
god
himself
could
not
make
spurgeon
believe
it
and
doubtless
there
are
many
high
churchmen
who
would
retort
that
nothing
short
of
a
miracle
could
make
them
assent
to
some
of
the
dogmas
of
their
assailant
indeed
the
incapacity
of
our
preacher
to
discern
or
mentally
to
reproduce
a
religious
character
differing
in
creed
from
his
own
makes
him
the
most
amusingly
intolerant
of
popes
not
because
he
is
malignant
but
because
he
is
spurgeon
if
he
had
learning
or
largeness
of
mind
he
would
probably
lose
the
greater
portion
of
his
power
he
gets
his
hearers
into
a
corner
limits
the
range
of
their
vision
to
the
doctrine
he
is
expounding
refuses
to
listen
to
any
excuses
or
palliations
and
then
screams
out
to
them
believe
or
be
damned
in
his
own
mind
he
is
sure
they
will
be
damned
if
they
do
not
believe
so
far
as
regards
his
influence
over
those
minds
whose
religious
emotions
are
strong
but
whose
religious
principles
are
weak
every
limitation
of
his
mind
is
an
increase
of
his
force
this
theological
narrowness
is
unaccompanied
with
theological
rancor
a
rough
but
genuine
benevolence
is
at
the
heart
of
system
he
wishes
his
opponents
to
be
converted
not
condemned
he
very
properly
feels
that
with
his
ideas
of
the
divine
government
he
would
be
the
basest
of
criminals
if
he
spared
himself
or
spared
either
entreaty
or
denunciation
in
the
great
work
of
saving
souls
he
throws
himself
with
such
passionate
earnestness
into
his
business
that
his
sermons
boil
over
with
the
excitement
of
his
feelings
indeed
it
is
difficult
to
say
whether
our
impressions
of
him
derived
from
the
written
page
come
to
us
more
from
the
eye
than
the
ear
his
very
style
foams
rages
prays
entreats
adjures
weeps
screams
warns
and
execrates
his
words
are
words
that
everybody
understands
bold
blunt
homely
quaint
level
to
his
nature
all
alive
with
passion
and
directed
with
the
single
purpose
of
carrying
the
fortresses
of
sin
by
assault
the
reader
who
contrives
to
preserve
his
calmness
amid
this
storm
of
words
can
not
but
be
vexed
that
rhetoric
so
efficient
should
frequently
be
combined
with
notions
so
narrow
with
bigotry
so
besotted
with
religious
principles
so
materialized
that
the
man
who
is
loudly
proclaimed
as
the
greatest
living
orator
of
the
pulpit
should
have
so
little
of
that
christian
spirit
which
refines
when
it
inflames
which
exalts
enlarges
and
purifies
the
natures
it
moves
for
spurgeon
is
after
all
little
more
than
a
theological
a
protestant
dominican
easy
of
comprehension
because
he
leaves
out
the
higher
elements
of
his
themes
and
not
hesitating
to
vulgarize
christianity
if
he
may
thereby
extend
it
among
the
vulgar
it
has
been
attempted
to
justify
him
by
the
examples
of
luther
and
bunyan
to
neither
of
whom
does
he
bear
more
than
the
most
superficial
resemblance
he
is
to
be
sure
as
natural
as
luther
but
then
his
nature
happens
to
be
a
puny
nature
as
compared
with
that
of
the
great
reformer
and
not
to
insist
on
specific
differences
it
is
certain
that
luther
if
alive
would
have
the
same
objection
to
spurgeon
bringing
down
the
doctrines
of
christianity
to
the
supposed
mental
condition
of
his
hearers
as
he
had
to
the
romanists
of
his
day
who
corrupted
religion
in
order
that
the
public
might
be
more
generally
accommodated
bunyan
phraseology
is
homely
but
celestializing
imagination
kept
his
familiar
grasp
of
things
divine
from
being
an
irreverent
pawing
of
things
divine
nature
works
on
a
low
level
of
influence
deficient
in
imagination
and
with
a
mind
coarse
and
unspiritualized
though
religiously
impressed
he
animalizes
his
creed
in
attempting
to
give
it
sensuous
reality
and
impressiveness
if
it
be
said
that
by
this
process
he
feels
his
way
into
hearts
which
could
not
be
affected
by
more
spiritual
means
the
answer
is
that
the
multitude
who
listened
to
the
sermon
on
the
mount
were
not
of
a
more
elevated
cast
of
mind
than
the
multitude
who
listened
to
spurgeon
sermon
on
regeneration
but
the
truth
is
that
spurgeon
preaching
is
liked
not
simply
because
it
rouses
sinners
to
repentance
but
because
it
gives
sinners
a
certain
enjoyment
it
is
racy
original
exciting
and
comes
directly
from
the
character
of
the
preacher
it
is
relished
as
spurgeon
tells
us
in
his
preface
by
princes
of
every
nation
and
nobles
of
every
rank
as
well
as
by
humbler
people
but
we
doubt
whether
christianity
should
be
vulgarized
to
give
jaded
nobles
a
new
sensation
or
in
order
to
be
made
a
fit
gospel
for
the
poor
the
border
land
of
the
christian
and
the
turk
comprising
adventures
of

army
new
york
rudd
carleton
broadway
james
oscar
noyes
the
author
of
this
book
is
an
american
all
over
he
has
the
rapidity
and
eagerness
of
mind
that
the
champagny
atmosphere
of
our
northern
hills
gives
to
those
who
are
stout
enough
not
to
be
wilted
by
our
hot
summers
for
briskness
thriftiness
energy
and
alacrity
it
is
hard
to
find
his
match
he
has
made
a
book
of
travels
and
will
make
a
hundred
unless
somebody
finds
him
a
place
at
home
where
he
will
have
an
indefinite
number
of
to
keep
him
busy
or
unless
some
african
prince
cuts
his
head
off
or
he
happens
to
call
upon
the
battas
about
their
here
he
has
been
streaming
through
eastern
europe
and
western
asia
so
hilarious
and
all
the
time
so
intensely
so
perfectly
at
home
everywhere
so
quick
at
making
friends
so
perfectly
convinced
that
the
world
was
made
for
american
travellers
and
so
apt
at
proving
it
by
his
own
example
that
his
friends
who
missed
him
for
a
while
not
only
were
not
astonished
to
find
that
he
had
been
a
surgeon
in
the
ottoman
army
during
this
brief
interval
but
only
wondered
he
had
not
been
grand
vizier
in
this
instance
the
book
is
the
man
if
we
may
so
far
change
monsieur
de
buffon
saying
it
is
full
of
fresh
observations
and
lively
descriptions
perhaps
a
little
too
overlarded
and
oversprigged
with
prose
and
verse
quotations
but
as
lively
as
a
golden
carp
just
landed
it
describes
scenes
not
familiar
to
most
readers
tells
stories
they
have
never
heard
introduces
them
to
new
costumes
and
faces
and
helps
itself
by
the
aid
of
pictures
to
make
its
vivacious
narrative
real
we
are
much
pleased
to
learn
that
the
work
has
met
with
a
very
good
reception
for
we
consider
it
as
the
card
of
introduction
of
a
gentleman
whom
the
american
people
will
very
probably
know
pretty
well
before
he
has
done
with
them
and
be
the
better
for
the
acquaintance
cantos
to

a
literal

translation
by
peabody
boston
ticknor
fields
a
man
must
be
either
conscious
of
poetic
gifts
and
possessed
of
real
learning
or
very
presumptuous
and
ignorant
who
undertakes
at
the
present
day
a
translation
of
dante
peabody
might
claim
exemption
from
this
on
the
ground
that
his
translation
is
not
a
one
but
he
himself
does
not
put
in
this
plea
and
we
can
not
grant
to
him
the
possession
of
poetic
power
or
declare
that
he
is
not
ignorant
and
presumptuous
he
says
in
his
preface
with
a
modesty
the
worth
of
which
will
soon
become
apparent
the
present
is
on
a
different
plan
from
all
other
translations
and
must
be
judged
accordingly
while
i
disclaim
all
intention
of
disputing
the
palm
as
a
poet
or
scholar
with
the
least
of
those
who
have
walked
with
dante
before
me
yet
by
such
labor
and
plodding
as
their
genius
would
not
allow
them
to
descend
to
have
i
made
a
more
literal
and
perhaps
therefore
a
better
translation
than
they
all
peabody
is
right
in
supposing
that
none
of
the
previous
translations
of
dante
could
descend
to
labor
and
plodding
as
his
in
carlyle
published
his
literal
prose
translation
of
the
inferno
it
was
in
many
respects
admirably
done
and
it
has
afforded
great
assistance
to
the
students
of
the
poet
in
their
first
progress
peabody
does
not
acknowledge
any
obligations
to
it
or
refer
to
it
in
any
way
let
us
however
compare
a
passage
or
two
of
the
two
versions
we
open
at
line
of
the
first
canto
we
do
not
divide
peabody
into
the
lines
of
verse
carlyle
art
thou
then
that
virgil
and
that
fountain
which
pours
abroad
so
rich
a
stream
of

i
answered
him
with
bashful
front
o
glory
and
light
of

may
the
long
zeal
avail
me
and
the
great
love
which
made
me
search
thy
volume
thou
art
my
master
and
my
author
peabody
art
thou
that
virgil
and
that
fountain
then
which
pours
abroad
so
rich
a
stream
of
speech
with
bashful
forehead
him
i
gave
reply
o
light
and
glory
of
the
other
bards
may
the
long
zeal
and
the
great
love
avail
me
that
hath
caused
me
thy
volume
to
explore
thou
art
my
master
thou
my
author
art
opening
again
at
random
we
take
the
two
translations
at
the
beginning
of
the
eighth
canto
carlyle
i
say
continuing
that
long
before
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
high
tower
our
eyes
went
upward
to
the
summit
because
of
two
flamelets
that
we
saw
put
there
and
another
from
far
gave
signal
back
so
far
that
the
eye
could
scarcely
catch
it
and
i
turning
to
the
sea
of
all
knowledge
said
what
says
this
and
what
replies
yon
other
light
and
who
are
they
that
made
it
peabody
i
say
continuing
that
long
before
unto
the
foot
of
that
high
tower
we
came
our
eyes
unto
its
summit
upward
went
cause
of
two
flamelets
that
we
saw
there
placed
while
signal
back
another
gave
from
far
so
far
the
eye
a
glimpse
could
hardly
catch
then
i
to
the
sea
of
all
wisdom
turned
and
said
what
sayeth
this
and
what
replies
that
other
fire
and
who
are
they
that
made
it
we
open
again
in
cantos
nine
and
ten
and
find
a
like
resemblance
between
carlyle
prose
and
peabody
metre
but
we
have
perhaps
quoted
enough
to
enable
our
readers
to
form
a
just
idea
of
the
latter
person
labor
and
plodding
it
is
not
however
in
the
text
alone
that
the
resemblance
exists
peabody
notes
bear
a
striking
conformity
to
carlyle
there
are
fourteen
notes
to
the
second
canto
in
peabody
book
taken
with
more
or
less
unimportant
alteration
and
addition
from
carlyle
without
acknowledgment
of
the
twelve
notes
to
canto
eight
nine
are
with
little
change
from
carlyle
we
have
compared
no
farther
uno
now
and
then
peabody
gives
us
a
note
of
his
own
in
the
first
canto
for
instance
he
explains
the
allegorical
greyhound
as
a
looked
for
reformer
coming
man
the
appropriateness
and
elegance
of
which
commentary
will
be
manifest
to
all
readers
familiar
with
the
allusion
in
the
fourth
canto
where
virgil
speaks
of
the
condition
of
the
souls
in
limbo
our
professed
translator
says
dante
says
this
in
bitter
irony
he
ill
brooks
the
narrow
bigotry
of
the
church
etc
showing
an
utter
ignorance
of
dante
real
adherence
to
the
doctrine
of
the
church
he
has
here
read
carlyle
note
with
less
attention
than
usual
for
a
quotation
contained
in
it
from
the
de
monarchià
would
have
set
him
right
the
quotation
is
however
in
latin
and
though
peabody
has
transferred
many
quotations
from
the
aeneid
through
carlyle
to
his
own
notes
they
are
often
so
printed
as
not
to
impress
one
with
a
strong
sense
of
his
familiarity
with
the
latin
language
we
give
one
instance
for
the
sake
of
illustration
on
page
appear
the
following
lines
terribili
squarlore
charon
eni
plurina
mento
canities
inculta
jucet
staut
lumina
flaurina
nor
is
he
happier
in
his
quotations
from
italian
or
in
his
other
displays
of
learning
having
occasion
to
quote
one
of
dante
most
familiar
lines
he
gives
it
in
this
way
lasciatte
ogni
speranzi
voi
anacreon
is
with
him
anachreon
vallombrosa
is
vallambroso
aristotelian
is
aristotleian
five
times
all
the
instances
in
which
the
name
occurs
the
ghibelline
appears
as
the
ghiberlines
and
montaperti
is
transformed
into
montapesti
nor
is
peabody
poetic
capacity
superior
to
his
honesty
or
his
learning
witness
such
lines
as
these
my
parents
natives
of
lombardy
were
they
come
to
blood
and
then
the
savage
party
like
as
at
palo
near
the
quarnãro
i
am
not
aeneas
i
am
not
paul
we
have
exhibited
sufficiently
the
merits
of
what
its
author
declares
to
be
perhaps
a
better
translation
than
any
other
he
says
that
the
whole
divine
comedy
of
which
these
ten
cantos
are
a
specimen
will
appear
in
due
time
if
the
specimen
be
a
fair
one
the
translation
of
the
purgatory
and
the
paradise
will
not
appear
until
after
the
publication
of
carlyle
prose
version
for
which
we
may
yet
have
to
wait
some
time
we
are
confident
that
so
honorable
a
publishing
house
as
that
of
ticknor
and
fields
must
have
been
unaware
of
the
character
of
a
book
so
full
of
false
pretences
when
they
allowed
their
name
to
be
put
on
the
but
to
make
up
for
even
unconscious
participation
in
such
a
literary
imposition
we
trust
that
they
will
soon
put
to
press
the
remainder
of
parsons
excellent
translation
of
dante
poem
a
specimen
of
which
appeared
so
long
since
bearing
their
imprint
by
alexander
smith
author
of
a
life
drama
and
other
poems
boston
ticknor
fields
on
the
first
appearance
of
alexander
smith
criticism
became
and
fairly
exhausted
its
whole
vocabulary
of
panegyric
in
giving
him
welcome
there
is
not
a
page
in
this
volume
on
which
we
can
not
find
some
novel
image
shakspearian
of
expression
or
some
striking
simile
said
the
critic
of
the
westminster
review
having
read
these
extracts
said
another
exponent
of
public
opinion
turn
any
poet
you
and
compare
the
texture
of
the
composition
it
is
a
severe
test
but
you
will
find
that
alexander
smith
bears
it
well
it
was
observable
however
that
all
this
praise
was
lavished
on
what
were
styled
beauties
passages
and
single
lines
bricks
from
the
edifice
were
extravagantly
eulogized
but
on
turning
to
the
poems
it
was
found
that
the
poetical
lines
and
passages
were
not
parts
of
a
whole
that
the
bricks
formed
no
edifice
at
all
there
were
no
indications
of
creative
genius
no
shaping
or
constructive
power
no
substance
and
fibre
of
individuality
no
signs
of
a
great
poetical
nature
but
a
splendid
anarchy
of
sensations
and
faculties
the
separate
beauties
as
the
author
had
heaped
and
huddled
them
together
presented
a
total
result
of
deformity
it
was
also
found
that
striking
as
some
of
the
images
metaphors
and
similes
were
they
gave
little
poetic
satisfaction
or
delight
a
certain
thinness
of
sentiment
poverty
of
idea
and
shallowness
of
experience
were
not
hidden
from
view
to
one
who
looked
sharply
through
the
gorgeous
wrappings
of
words
a
small
but
sensitive
and
facile
nature
capable
of
fully
expressing
itself
by
the
grace
of
a
singularly
fluent
fancy
with
an
appetite
for
beauty
rather
than
a
passion
for
it
with
no
essential
imagination
and
opulence
of
soul
this
was
the
mortifying
result
to
which
we
were
conducted
by
analysis
still
it
was
asserted
that
the
luxuriance
of
the
young
poet
mind
promised
much
let
a
few
years
pass
and
tennyson
and
browning
and
elizabeth
barrett
would
be
at
his
feet
a
few
years
have
passed
and
here
is
his
second
volume
it
has
less
richness
of
fancy
than
the
first
but
its
merits
and
demerits
are
the
same
the
man
has
not
yet
grown
into
a
poet
has
not
yet
learned
that
the
foliage
flowers
and
fruits
of
the
mind
should
be
connected
with
primal
roots
in
its
individual
being
these
are
still
tied
on
in
his
old
manner
to
a
succession
of
thoughts
and
emotions
which
have
themselves
little
vital
connection
with
each
other
the
in
his
blood
which
gave
an
appearance
of
exulting
and
abounding
life
to
his
first
poems
has
somewhat
subsided
now
and
the
effect
is
that
the
city
poems
as
a
whole
are
leaner
in
spirit
and
more
morbid
and
despondent
in
tone
than
the
life
drama
yet
there
is
still
so
much
that
is
superficially
striking
in
the
volume
such
a
waste
of
imagery
and
emotion
and
so
many
occasional
lines
and
epithets
of
real
power
and
beauty
that
we
close
the
volume
with
some
vexation
and
pain
at
our
inability
to
award
it
the
praise
which
many
readers
will
think
it
deserves
foreign

novelle
auf

heller
a
very
interesting
novel
indeed
sketching
life
at
the
little
court
of
the
duke
of
wurtemberg
at
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
a
famous
mistress
of
the
duke

countess

the
main
points
of
interest
in
the
story
are
historical
and
the
tissue
of
fiction
interwoven
with
these
is
remarkably
well
arranged
herr
heller
belongs
to
the
school
of
german
novelists
who
like
hermann
kurz
and
others
of
minor
mark
make
a
copious
and
comprehensive
use
of
historical
facts
in
art
their
object
and
aim
seem
to
be
rather
to
illustrate
and
embody
the
historical
facts
in
the
flesh
and
blood
of
tangible
reality
than
merely
to
amuse
by
transforming
history
into
a
material
for
poetical
entertainment
with
all
that
the
abovenamed
little
volume
is
amply
worth
reading

a
painter
describes
here
a
summer
journey
through
the
desert
of
sahara
as
far
south
from
algiers
as
el
aghouat
in
the
year
there
is
not
much
that
is
new
in
this
book
considering
the
many
later
and
far
more
comprehensive
and
extensive
illustrations
of
life
in
the
great
desert
since
published
by
bayard
taylor
barth
and
others
but
it
is
a
very
interesting
picture
of
this
life
as
seen
and
drawn
by
a
painter
his
descriptions
contain
many
landscape
and
pictures
by
means
of
which
a
vivid
idea
of
the
scenery
and
life
are
conveyed
to
the
imagination
of
the
reader
