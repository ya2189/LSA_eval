this
pamphlet
was
first
published
in
but
was
subsequently
reprinted
it
not
apparent
if
the
curiosities
in
spelling
date
back
to
the
original
or
were
introduced
later
they
have
been
retained
as
found
and
the
reader
is
left
to
decide
please
verify
with

quoting
this
material
southern
horrors
lynch
law
in
all
its
phases
by
ida
preface
the
greater
part
of
what
is
contained
in
these
pages
was
published
in
the
york
june
in
explanation
of
the
editorial
which
the
memphis
whites
considered
sufficiently
infamous
to
justify
the
destruction
of
my
paper
the
since
the
appearance
of
that
statement
requests
have
come
from
all
parts
of
the
country
that
exiled
the
name
under
which
it
then
appeared
be
issued
in
pamphlet
form
some
donations
were
made
but
not
enough
for
that
purpose
the
noble
effort
of
the
ladies
of
new
york
and
brooklyn
have
enabled
me
to
comply
with
this
request
and
give
the
world
a
true
unvarnished
account
of
the
causes
of
lynch
law
in
the
south
this
statement
is
not
a
shield
for
the
despoiler
of
virtue
nor
altogether
a
defense
for
the
poor
blind
sampsons
who
suffer
themselves
to
be
betrayed
by
white
delilahs
it
is
a
contribution
to
truth
an
array
of
facts
the
perusal
of
which
it
is
hoped
will
stimulate
this
great
american
republic
to
demand
that
justice
be
done
though
the
heavens
fall
it
is
with
no
pleasure
i
have
dipped
my
hands
in
the
corruption
here
exposed
somebody
must
show
that
the
race
is
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
and
it
seems
to
have
fallen
upon
me
to
do
so
the
awful
that
judge
lynch
is
calling
every
week
is
appalling
not
only
because
of
the
lives
it
takes
the
rank
cruelty
and
outrage
to
the
victims
but
because
of
the
prejudice
it
fosters
and
the
stain
it
places
against
the
good
name
of
a
weak
race
the
is
not
a
bestial
race
if
this
work
can
contribute
in
any
way
toward
proving
this
and
at
the
same
time
arouse
the
conscience
of
the
american
people
to
a
demand
for
justice
to
every
citizen
and
punishment
by
law
for
the
lawless
i
shall
feel
i
have
done
my
race
a
service
other
considerations
are
of
minor
importance

to
the
women
of
new
york
and
brooklyn
whose
race
love
earnest
zeal
and
unselfish
effort
at
lyric
hall
in
the
city
of
new
york
on
the
night
of
october
made
possible
its
publication
this
pamphlet
is
gratefully
dedicated
by
the
author
hon
fred
douglass
letter
miss
wells
let
me
give
you
thanks
for
your
faithful
paper
on
the
lynch
abomination
now
generally
practiced
against
colored
people
in
the
south
there
has
been
no
word
equal
to
it
in
convincing
power
i
have
spoken
but
my
word
is
feeble
in
comparison
you
give
us
what
you
know
and
testify
from
actual
knowledge
you
have
dealt
with
the
facts
with
cool
painstaking
fidelity
and
left
those
naked
and
uncontradicted
facts
to
speak
for
themselves
brave
woman
you
have
done
your
people
and
mine
a
service
which
can
neither
be
weighed
nor
measured
if
american
conscience
were
only
half
alive
if
the
american
church
and
clergy
were
only
half
christianized
if
american
moral
sensibility
were
not
hardened
by
persistent
infliction
of
outrage
and
crime
against
colored
people
a
scream
of
horror
shame
and
indignation
would
rise
to
heaven
wherever
your
pamphlet
shall
be
read
but
alas
even
crime
has
power
to
reproduce
itself
and
create
conditions
favorable
to
its
own
existence
it
sometimes
seems
we
are
deserted
by
earth
and
heaven
yet
we
must
still
think
speak
and
work
and
trust
in
the
power
of
a
merciful
god
for
final
deliverance
very
truly
and
gratefully
yours

wednesday
evening
may
the
city
of
memphis
was
filled
with
excitement
editorials
in
the
daily
papers
of
that
date
caused
a
meeting
to
be
held
in
the
cotton
exchange
building
a
committee
was
sent
for
the
editors
of
the
an
journal
published
in
that
city
and
the
only
reason
the
open
threats
of
lynching
that
were
made
were
not
carried
out
was
because
they
could
not
be
found
the
cause
of
all
this
commotion
was
the
following
editorial
published
in
the
may
the
saturday
previous
eight
negroes
lynched
since
last
issue
of
the
one
at
little
rock
last
saturday
morning
where
the
citizens
broke
into
the
penitentiary
and
got
their
man
three
near
anniston
one
near
new
orleans
and
three
at
clarksville
the
last
three
for
killing
a
white
man
and
five
on
the
same
old
racket
the
new
alarm
about
raping
white
women
the
same
programme
of
hanging
then
shooting
bullets
into
the
lifeless
bodies
was
carried
out
to
the
letter
nobody
in
this
section
of
the
country
believes
the
old
lie
that
negro
men
rape
white
women
if
southern
white
men
are
not
careful
they
will
overreach
themselves
and
public
sentiment
will
have
a
reaction
a
conclusion
will
then
be
reached
which
will
be
very
damaging
to
the
moral
reputation
of
their
women
the
of
wednesday
following
may
contained
the
following
leader
those
negroes
who
are
attempting
to
make
the
lynching
of
individuals
of
their
race
a
means
for
arousing
the
worst
passions
of
their
kind
are
playing
with
a
dangerous
sentiment
the
negroes
may
as
well
understand
that
there
is
no
mercy
for
the
negro
rapist
and
little
patience
with
his
defenders
a
negro
organ
printed
in
this
city
in
a
recent
issue
publishes
the
following
atrocious
paragraph
nobody
in
this
section
of
the
country
believes
the
old
lie
that
negro
men
rape
white
women
if
southern
white
men
are
not
careful
they
will
overreach
themselves
and
public
sentiment
will
have
a
reaction
and
a
conclusion
will
be
reached
which
will
be
very
damaging
to
the
moral
reputation
of
their
women
the
fact
that
a
black
scoundrel
is
allowed
to
live
and
utter
such
loathsome
and
repulsive
calumnies
is
a
volume
of
evidence
as
to
the
wonderful
patience
of
southern
whites
but
we
have
had
enough
of
it
there
are
some
things
that
the
southern
white
man
will
not
tolerate
and
the
obscene
intimations
of
the
foregoing
have
brought
the
writer
to
the
very
outermost
limit
of
public
patience
we
hope
we
have
said
enough
the
of
same
date
copied
the
editorial
with
these
words
of
comment
patience
under
such
circumstances
is
not
a
virtue
if
the
negroes
themselves
do
not
apply
the
remedy
without
delay
it
will
be
the
duty
of
those
whom
he
has
attacked
to
tie
the
wretch
who
utters
these
calumnies
to
a
stake
at
the
intersection
of
main
and
madison
brand
him
in
the
forehead
with
a
hot
iron
and
perform
upon
him
a
surgical
operation
with
a
pair
of
tailor
shears
acting
upon
this
advice
the
leading
citizens
met
in
the
cotton
exchange
building
the
same
evening
and
threats
of
lynching
were
freely
indulged
not
by
the
lawless
element
upon
which
the
deviltry
of
the
south
is
usually
saddled
but
by
the
leading
business
men
in
their
leading
business
centre
fleming
the
business
manager
and
owning
a
half
interest
the
had
to
leave
town
to
escape
the
mob
and
was
afterwards
ordered
not
to
return
letters
and
telegrams
sent
me
in
new
york
where
i
was
spending
my
vacation
advised
me
that
bodily
harm
awaited
my
return
creditors
took
possession
of
the
office
and
sold
the
outfit
and
the
was
as
if
it
had
never
been
the
editorial
in
question
was
prompted
by
the
many
inhuman
and
fiendish
lynchings
of
which
have
recently
taken
place
and
was
meant
as
a
warning
eight
lynched
in
one
week
and
five
of
them
charged
with
rape
the
thinking
public
will
not
easily
believe
freedom
and
education
more
brutalizing
than
slavery
and
the
world
knows
that
the
crime
of
rape
was
unknown
during
four
years
of
civil
war
when
the
white
women
of
the
south
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
race
which
is
all
at
once
charged
with
being
a
bestial
one
since
my
business
has
been
destroyed
and
i
am
an
exile
from
home
because
of
that
editorial
the
issue
has
been
forced
and
as
the
writer
of
it
i
feel
that
the
race
and
the
public
generally
should
have
a
statement
of
the
facts
as
they
exist
they
will
serve
at
the
same
time
as
a
defense
for
the
sampsons
who
suffer
themselves
to
be
betrayed
by
white
delilahs
the
whites
of
montgomery
knew
duke
sounded
the
keynote
of
the
situation
which
they
would
gladly
hide
from
the
world
when
he
said
in
his
paper
the
five
years
ago
why
is
it
that
white
women
attract
negro
men
now
more
than
in
former
days
there
was
a
time
when
such
a
thing
was
unheard
of
there
is
a
secret
to
this
thing
and
we
greatly
suspect
it
is
the
growing
appreciation
of
white
juliets
for
colored
romeos
duke
like
the
proprietors
was
forced
to
leave
the
city
for
reflecting
on
the
honah
of
white
women
and
his
paper
suppressed
but
the
truth
remains
that
men
do
not
always
rape
white
women
without
their
consent
duke
before
leaving
montgomery
signed
a
card
disclaiming
any
intention
of
slandering
southern
white
women
the
editor
of
the
has
no
disclaimer
to
enter
but
asserts
instead
that
there
are
many
white
women
in
the
south
who
would
marry
colored
men
if
such
an
act
would
not
place
them
at
once
beyond
the
pale
of
society
and
within
the
clutches
of
the
law
the
miscegnation
laws
of
the
south
only
operate
against
the
legitimate
union
of
the
races
they
leave
the
white
man
free
to
seduce
all
the
colored
girls
he
can
but
it
is
death
to
the
colored
man
who
yields
to
the
force
and
advances
of
a
similar
attraction
in
white
women
white
men
lynch
the
offending
not
because
he
is
a
despoiler
of
virtue
but
because
he
succumbs
to
the
smiles
of
white
women
black
white
it
the
of
january
publishes
a
case
in
point
underwood
the
wife
of
a
minister
of
elyria
ohio
accused
an
of
rape
she
told
her
husband
that
during
his
absence
in
stumping
the
state
for
the
prohibition
party
the
man
came
to
the
kitchen
door
forced
his
way
in
the
house
and
insulted
her
she
tried
to
drive
him
out
with
a
heavy
poker
but
he
overpowered
and
chloroformed
her
and
when
she
revived
her
clothing
was
torn
and
she
was
in
a
horrible
condition
she
did
not
know
the
man
but
could
identify
him
she
pointed
out
william
offett
a
married
man
who
was
arrested
and
being
in
ohio
was
granted
a
trial
the
prisoner
vehemently
denied
the
charge
of
rape
but
confessed
he
went
to
underwood
residence
at
her
invitation
and
was
criminally
intimate
with
her
at
her
request
this
availed
him
nothing
against
the
sworn
testimony
of
a
ministers
wife
a
lady
of
the
highest
respectability
he
was
found
guilty
and
entered
the
penitentiary
december
for
fifteen
years
some
time
afterwards
the
woman
remorse
led
her
to
confess
to
her
husband
that
the
man
was
innocent
these
are
her
words
i
met
offett
at
the
post
office
it
was
raining
he
was
polite
to
me
and
as
i
had
several
bundles
in
my
arms
he
offered
to
carry
them
home
for
me
which
he
did
he
had
a
strange
fascination
for
me
and
i
invited
him
to
call
on
me
he
called
bringing
chestnuts
and
candy
for
the
children
by
this
means
we
got
them
to
leave
us
alone
in
the
room
then
i
sat
on
his
lap
he
made
a
proposal
to
me
and
i
readily
consented
why
i
did
so
i
do
not
know
but
that
i
did
is
true
he
visited
me
several
times
after
that
and
each
time
i
was
indiscreet
i
did
not
care
after
the
first
time
in
fact
i
could
not
have
resisted
and
had
no
desire
to
resist
when
asked
by
her
husband
why
she
told
him
she
had
been
outraged
she
said
i
had
several
reasons
for
telling
you
one
was
the
neighbors
saw
the
fellows
here
another
was
i
was
afraid
i
had
contracted
a
loathsome
disease
and
still
another
was
that
i
feared
i
might
give
birth
to
a
negro
baby
i
hoped
to
save
my
reputation
by
telling
you
a
deliberate
lie
her
husband
horrified
by
the
confession
had
offett
who
had
already
served
four
years
released
and
secured
a
divorce
there
are
thousands
of
such
cases
throughout
the
south
with
the
difference
that
the
southern
white
men
in
insatiate
fury
wreak
their
vengeance
without
intervention
of
law
upon
the
who
consort
with
their
women
a
few
instances
to
substantiate
the
assertion
that
some
white
women
love
the
company
of
the
will
not
be
out
of
place
most
of
these
cases
were
reported
by
the
daily
papers
of
the
south
in
the
winter
of
the
wife
of
a
practicing
physician
in
memphis
in
good
social
standing
whose
name
has
escaped
me
left
home
husband
and
children
and
ran
away
with
her
black
coachman
she
was
with
him
a
month
before
her
husband
found
and
brought
her
home
the
coachman
could
not
be
found
the
doctor
moved
his
family
away
from
memphis
and
is
living
in
another
city
under
an
assumed
name
in
the
same
city
last
year
a
white
girl
in
the
dusk
of
evening
screamed
at
the
approach
of
some
parties
that
a
negro
had
assaulted
her
on
the
street
he
was
captured
tried
by
a
white
judge
and
jury
that
acquitted
him
of
the
charge
it
is
needless
to
add
if
there
had
been
a
scrap
of
evidence
on
which
to
convict
him
of
so
grave
a
charge
he
would
have
been
convicted
sarah
clark
of
memphis
loved
a
black
man
and
lived
openly
with
him
when
she
was
indicted
last
spring
for
miscegenation
she
swore
in
court
that
she
was
a
white
woman
this
she
did
to
escape
the
penitentiary
and
continued
her
illicit
relation
undisturbed
that
she
is
of
the
lower
class
of
whites
does
not
disturb
the
fact
that
she
is
a
white
woman
the
leading
citizens
of
memphis
are
defending
the
honor
of
white
women
included
since
the
manager
of
the
has
been
run
away
from
memphis
by
the
guardians
of
the
honor
of
southern
white
women
a
young
girl
living
on
poplar
who
was
discovered
in
intimate
relations
with
a
handsome
mulatto
young
colored
man
will
morgan
by
name
stole
her
father
money
to
send
the
young
fellow
away
from
that
father
wrath
she
has
since
joined
him
in
chicago
the
for
june
has
the
following
if
lillie
bailey
a
rather
pretty
white
girl
seventeen
years
of
age
who
is
now
at
the
city
hospital
would
be
somewhat
less
reserved
about
her
disgrace
there
would
be
some
very
nauseating
details
in
the
story
of
her
life
she
is
the
mother
of
a
little
coon
the
truth
might
reveal
fearful
depravity
or
it
might
reveal
the
evidence
of
a
rank
outrage
she
will
not
divulge
the
name
of
the
man
who
has
left
such
black
evidence
of
her
disgrace
and
in
fact
says
it
is
a
matter
in
which
there
can
be
no
interest
to
the
outside
world
she
came
to
memphis
nearly
three
months
ago
and
was
taken
in
at
the
woman
refuge
in
the
southern
part
of
the
city
she
remained
there
until
a
few
weeks
ago
when
the
child
was
born
the
ladies
in
charge
of
the
refuge
were
horified
the
girl
was
at
once
sent
to
the
city
hospital
where
she
has
been
since
may
she
is
a
country
girl
she
came
to
memphis
from
her
fathers
farm
a
short
distance
from
hernando
miss
just
when
she
left
there
she
would
not
say
in
fact
she
says
she
came
to
memphis
from
arkansas
and
says
her
home
is
in
that
state
she
is
rather
good
looking
has
blue
eyes
a
low
forehead
and
dark
red
hair
the
ladies
at
the
woman
refuge
do
not
know
anything
about
the
girl
further
than
what
they
learned
when
she
was
an
inmate
of
the
institution

she
would
not
tell
much
when
the
child
was
born
an
attempt
was
made
to
get
the
girl
to
reveal
the
name
of
the
negro
who
had
disgraced
her
she
obstinately
refused
and
it
was
impossible
to
elicit
any
information
from
her
on
the
subject
note
the
wording
the
truth
might
reveal
fearful
depravity
or
rank
outrage
if
it
had
been
a
white
child
or
lillie
bailey
had
told
a
pitiful
story
of
negro
outrage
it
would
have
been
a
case
of
woman
weakness
or
assault
and
she
could
have
remained
at
the
woman
refuge
but
a
negro
child
and
to
withhold
its
father
name
and
thus
prevent
the
killing
of
another
negro
rapist
a
case
of
fearful
depravity
the
very
week
the
leading
citizens
of
memphis
were
making
a
spectacle
of
themselves
in
defense
of
all
white
women
of
every
kind
an
stricklin
was
found
in
a
white
woman
room
in
that
city
although
she
made
no
outcry
of
rape
he
was
jailed
and
would
have
been
lynched
but
the
woman
stated
she
bought
curtains
of
him
he
was
a
furniture
dealer
and
his
business
in
her
room
that
night
was
to
put
them
up
a
white
woman
word
was
taken
as
absolutely
in
this
case
as
when
the
cry
of
rape
is
made
and
he
was
freed
what
is
true
of
memphis
is
true
of
the
entire
south
the
daily
papers
last
year
reported
a
farmer
wife
in
alabama
had
given
birth
to
a
negro
child
when
the
negro
farm
hand
who
was
plowing
in
the
field
heard
it
he
took
the
mule
from
the
plow
and
fled
the
dispatches
also
told
of
a
woman
in
south
carolina
who
gave
birth
to
a
negro
child
and
charged
three
men
with
being
its
father
one
of
whom
has
since
in
tuscumbia
the
colored
boy
who
was
lynched
there
last
year
for
assaulting
a
white
girl
told
her
before
his
accusers
that
he
had
met
her
there
in
the
woods
often
before
frank
weems
of
chattanooga
who
was
not
lynched
in
may
only
because
the
prominent
citizens
became
his
body
guard
until
the
doors
of
the
penitentiary
closed
on
him
had
letters
in
his
pocket
from
the
white
woman
in
the
case
making
the
appointment
with
him
edward
coy
who
was
burned
alive
in
texarkana
january
died
protesting
his
innocence
investigation
since
as
given
by
the
bystander
in
the
inter
october
proves
the
woman
who
was
paraded
as
a
victim
of
violence
was
of
bad
character
her
husband
was
a
drunkard
and
a
gambler
she
was
publicly
reported
and
generally
known
to
have
been
criminally
intimate
with
coy
for
more
than
a
year
previous
she
was
compelled
by
threats
if
not
by
violence
to
make
the
charge
against
the
victim
when
she
came
to
apply
the
match
coy
asked
her
if
she
would
burn
him
after
they
had
been
sweethearting
so
long
a
large
majority
of
the
superior
white
men
prominent
in
the
affair
are
the
reputed
fathers
of
mulatto
children
these
are
not
pleasant
facts
but
they
are
illustrative
of
the
vital
phase
of
the
race
question
which
should
properly
be
designated
an
earnest
inquiry
as
to
the
best
methods
by
which
religion
science
law
and
political
power
may
be
employed
to
excuse
injustice
barbarity
and
crime
done
to
a
people
because
of
race
and
color
there
can
be
no
possible
belief
that
these
people
were
inspired
by
any
consuming
zeal
to
vindicate
god
law
against
miscegnationists
of
the
most
practical
sort
the
woman
was
a
willing
partner
in
the
guilt
and
being
of
the
superior
race
must
naturally
have
been
more
guilty
in
natchez
marshall
one
of
the
de
la
of
the
city
created
a
tremendous
sensation
several
years
ago
she
has
a
black
coachman
who
was
married
and
had
been
in
her
employ
several
years
during
this
time
she
gave
birth
to
a
child
whose
color
was
remarked
but
traced
to
some
brunette
ancestor
and
one
of
the
fashionable
dames
of
the
city
was
its
godmother
marshall
social
position
was
unquestioned
and
wealth
showered
every
dainty
on
this
child
which
was
idolized
with
its
brothers
and
sisters
by
its
white
papa
in
course
of
time
another
child
appeared
on
the
scene
but
it
was
unmistakably
dark
all
were
alarmed
and
rush
of
blood
strangulation
were
the
conjectures
but
the
doctor
when
asked
the
cause
grimly
told
them
it
was
a
negro
child
there
was
a
family
conclave
the
coachman
heard
of
it
and
leaving
his
own
family
went
west
and
has
never
returned
as
soon
as
marshall
was
able
to
travel
she
was
sent
away
in
deep
disgrace
her
husband
died
within
the
year
of
a
broken
heart
ebenzer
fowler
the
wealthiest
colored
man
in
issaquena
county
was
shot
down
on
the
street
in
mayersville
january
just
before
dark
by
an
armed
body
of
white
men
who
filled
his
body
with
bullets
they
charged
him
with
writing
a
note
to
a
white
woman
of
the
place
which
they
intercepted
and
which
proved
there
was
an
intimacy
existing
between
them
hundreds
of
such
cases
might
be
cited
but
enough
have
been
given
to
prove
the
assertion
that
there
are
white
women
in
the
south
who
love
the
company
even
as
there
are
white
men
notorious
for
their
preference
for
women
there
is
hardly
a
town
in
the
south
which
has
not
an
instance
of
the
kind
which
is
well
known
and
hence
the
assertion
is
reiterated
that
nobody
in
the
south
believes
the
old
thread
bare
lie
that
negro
men
rape
white
women
hence
there
is
a
growing
demand
among
that
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
parties
accused
of
rape
be
fully
established
they
know
the
men
of
the
section
of
the
country
who
refuse
this
are
not
so
desirous
of
punishing
rapists
as
they
pretend
the
utterances
of
the
leading
white
men
show
that
with
them
it
is
not
the
crime
but
the
bishop
fitzgerald
has
become
apologist
for
lynchers
of
the
rapists
of
women
only
governor
tillman
of
south
carolina
in
the
month
of
june
standing
under
the
tree
in
barnwell
on
which
eight
were
hung
last
year
declared
that
he
would
lead
a
mob
to
lynch
a
who
raped
a
woman
so
say
the
pulpits
officials
and
newspapers
of
the
south
but
when
the
victim
is
a
colored
woman
it
is
different
last
winter
in
baltimore
three
white
ruffians
assaulted
a
miss
camphor
a
young
girl
while
out
walking
with
a
young
man
of
her
own
race
they
held
her
escort
and
outraged
the
girl
it
was
a
deed
dastardly
enough
to
arouse
southern
blood
which
gives
its
horror
of
rape
as
excuse
for
lawlessness
but
she
was
an
the
case
went
to
the
courts
an
lawyer
defended
the
men
and
they
were
acquitted
in
nashville
there
is
a
white
man
pat
hanifan
who
outraged
a
little
girl
and
from
the
physical
injuries
received
she
has
been
ruined
for
life
he
was
jailed
for
six
months
discharged
and
is
now
a
detective
in
that
city
in
the
same
city
last
may
a
white
man
outraged
an
girl
in
a
drug
store
he
was
arrested
and
released
on
bail
at
the
trial
it
was
rumored
that
five
hundred
had
organized
to
lynch
him
two
hundred
and
fifty
white
citizens
armed
themselves
with
winchesters
and
guarded
him
a
cannon
was
placed
in
front
of
his
home
and
the
buchanan
rifles
state
militia
ordered
to
the
scene
for
his
protection
the
mob
did
not
materialize
only
two
weeks
before
eph

who
had
only
been
with
rape
upon
a
white
woman
had
been
taken
from
the
jail
with

buchanan
and
the
police
and
militia
standing
by
dragged
through
the
streets
in
broad
daylight
knives
plunged
into
him
at
every
step
and
with
every
fiendish
cruelty
a
frenzied
mob
could
devise
he
was
at
last
swung
out
on
the
bridge
with
hands
cut
to
pieces
as
he
tried
to
climb
up
the
stanchions
a
naked
bloody
example
of
the
of
the
civilization
of
the
athens
of
the
south
no
cannon
or
military
was
called
out
in
his
defense
he
dared
to
visit
a
white
woman
at
the
very
moment
these
civilized
whites
were
announcing
their
determination
to
protect
their
wives
and
daughters
by
murdering
grizzard
a
white
man
was
in
the
same
jail
for
raping
maggie
reese
an
girl
he
was
not
harmed
the
honor
of
grown
women
who
were
glad
enough
to
be
supported
by
the
grizzard
boys
and
ed
coy
as
long
as
the
liaison
was
not
known
needed
protection
they
were

the
outrage
upon
helpless
childhood
needed
no
avenging

two
months
ago
inflicted
such
injuries
upon
another

that
she
died
he
was
not
punished
but
an
attempt
was
made
in
the

town
in
the
month
of

to
lynch
an

new
cry
the
appeal
of
southern
whites
to
northern
sympathy
and
sanction
the
adroit
insiduous
plea
made
by
bishop
fitzgerald
for
suspension
of
judgment
because
those
who
condemn
lynching
express
no
sympathy
for
the
woman
in
the
case
falls
to
the
ground
in
the
light
of
the
foregoing
from
this
exposition
of
the
race
issue
in
lynch
law
the
whole
matter
is
explained
by
the
opposition
growing
out
of
slavery
to
the
progress
of
the
race
this
is
crystalized
in
the
slogan
this
is
a
white
man
country
and
the
white
man
must
rule
the
south
resented
giving
the
his
freedom
the
ballot
box
and
the
civil
rights
law
the
raids
of
the
and
white
liners
to
subvert
reconstruction
government
the
hamburg
and
ellerton
the
copiah
county
and
the
layfayette
parish
massacres
were
excused
as
the
natural
resentment
of
intelligence
against
government
by
ignorance
honest
white
men
practically
conceded
the
necessity
of
intelligence
murdering
ignorance
to
correct
the
mistake
of
the
general
government
and
the
race
was
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
solid
south
thoughtful
with
the
strong
arm
of
the
government
withdrawn
and
with
the
hope
to
stop
such
wholesale
massacres
urged
the
race
to
sacrifice
its
political
rights
for
sake
of
peace
they
honestly
believed
the
race
should
fit
itself
for
government
and
when
that
should
be
done
the
objection
to
race
participation
in
politics
would
be
removed
but
the
sacrifice
did
not
remove
the
trouble
nor
move
the
south
to
justice
one
by
one
the
southern
states
have
legally
disfranchised
the
and
since
the
repeal
of
the
civil
rights
bill
nearly
every
southern
state
has
passed
separate
car
laws
with
a
penalty
against
their
infringement
the
race
regardless
of
advancement
is
penned
into
filthy
stifling
partitions
cut
off
from
smoking
cars
all
this
while
although
the
political
cause
has
been
removed
the
butcheries
of
black
men
at
barnwell
carrolton
waycross
and
memphis
have
gone
on
also
the
flaying
alive
of
a
man
in
kentucky
the
burning
of
one
in
arkansas
the
hanging
of
a
girl
in
louisiana
a
woman
in
jackson
and
one
in
hollendale
until
the
dark
and
bloody
record
of
the
south
shows
lynched
during
the
past
eight
years
not
fifty
of
these
were
for
political
causes
the
rest
were
for
all
manner
of
accusations
from
that
of
rape
of
white
women
to
the
case
of
the
boy
will
lewis
who
was
hanged
at
tullahoma
last
year
for
being
drunk
and
sassy
to
white
folks
these
statistics
compiled
by
the
were
given
the
first
of
this
year
since
then
not
less
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
have
been
known
to
have
met
violent
death
at
the
hands
of
cruel
bloodthirsty
mobs
during
the
past
nine
months
to
palliate
this
record
which
grows
worse
as
the
becomes
intelligent
and
excuse
some
of
the
most
heinous
crimes
that
ever
stained
the
history
of
a
country
the
south
is
shielding
itself
behind
the
plausible
screen
of
defending
the
honor
of
its
women
this
too
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
only
of
the
victims
to
mobs
have
been
with
rape
to
say
nothing
of
those
of
that
who
were
innocent
of
the
charge
a
white
correspondent
of
the
declares
that
the
who
was
lynched
in
chestertown
in
may
for
assault
on
a
white
girl
was
innocent
that
the
deed
was
done
by
a
white
man
who
had
since
disappeared
the
girl
herself
maintained
that
her
assailant
was
a
white
man
when
that
poor
was
murdered
the
whites
excused
their
refusal
of
a
trial
on
the
ground
that
they
wished
to
spare
the
white
girl
the
mortification
of
having
to
testify
in
court
this
cry
has
had
its
effect
it
has
closed
the
heart
stifled
the
conscience
warped
the
judgment
and
hushed
the
voice
of
press
and
pulpit
on
the
subject
of
lynch
law
throughout
this
land
of
liberty
men
who
stand
high
in
the
esteem
of
the
public
for
christian
character
for
moral
and
physical
courage
for
devotion
to
the
principles
of
equal
and
exact
justice
to
all
and
for
great
sagacity
stand
as
cowards
who
fear
to
open
their
mouths
before
this
great
outrage
they
do
not
see
that
by
their
tacit
encouragement
their
silent
acquiescence
the
black
shadow
of
lawlessness
in
the
form
of
lynch
law
is
spreading
its
wings
over
the
whole
country
men
who
like
governor
tillman
start
the
ball
of
lynch
law
rolling
for
a
certain
crime
are
powerless
to
stop
it
when
drunken
or
criminal
white
toughs
feel
like
hanging
an
on
any
pretext
even
to
the
better
class
of
the
crime
of
rape
is
so
revolting
they
have
too
often
taken
the
white
man
word
and
given
lynch
law
neither
the
investigation
nor
condemnation
it
deserved
they
forget
that
a
concession
of
the
right
to
lynch
a
man
for
a
certain
crime
not
only
concedes
the
right
to
lynch
any
person
for
any
crime
but
so
frequently
is
the
cry
of
rape
now
raised
it
is
in
a
fair
way
to
stamp
us
a
race
of
rapists
and
desperadoes
they
have
gone
on
hoping
and
believing
that
general
education
and
financial
strength
would
solve
the
difficulty
and
are
devoting
their
energies
to
the
accumulation
of
both
the
mob
spirit
has
grown
with
the
increasing
intelligence
of
the
it
has
left
the
places
where
ignorance
prevails
has
thrown
off
the
mask
and
with
this
new
cry
stalks
in
broad
daylight
in
large
cities
the
centers
of
civilization
and
is
encouraged
by
the
leading
citizens
and
the
press
malicious
untruthful
white
press
the
and
of
memphis
are
owned
by
leading
business
men
of
that
city
and
yet
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
had
been
no
white
woman
in
memphis
outraged
by
an
and
that
memphis
possessed
a
thrifty
class
of
the
of
may
under
the
head
of
more
rapes
more
lynchings
gave
utterance
to
the
following
the
lynching
of
three
negro
scoundrels
reported
in
our
dispatches
from
anniston
for
a
brutal
outrage
committed
upon
a
white
woman
will
be
a
text
for
much
comment
on
southern
barbarism
by
northern
newspapers
but
we
fancy
it
will
hardly
prove
effective
for
campaign
purposes
among
intelligent
people
the
frequency
of
these
lynchings
calls
attention
to
the
frequency
of
the
crimes
which
causes
lynching
the
southern
barbarism
which
deserves
the
serious
attention
of
all
people
north
and
south
is
the
barbarism
which
preys
upon
weak
and
defenseless
women
nothing
but
the
most
prompt
speedy
and
extreme
punishment
can
hold
in
check
the
horrible
and
beastial
propensities
of
the
negro
race
there
is
a
strange
similarity
about
a
number
of
cases
of
this
character
which
have
lately
occurred
in
each
case
the
crime
was
deliberately
planned
and
perpetrated
by
several
negroes
they
watched
for
an
opportunity
when
the
women
were
left
without
a
protector
it
was
not
a
sudden
yielding
to
a
fit
of
passion
but
the
consummation
of
a
devilish
purpose
which
has
been
seeking
and
waiting
for
the
opportunity
this
feature
of
the
crime
not
only
makes
it
the
most
fiendishly
brutal
but
it
adds
to
the
terror
of
the
situation
in
the
thinly
settled
country
communities
no
man
can
leave
his
family
at
night
without
the
dread
that
some
roving
negro
ruffian
is
watching
and
waiting
for
this
opportunity
the
swift
punishment
which
invariably
follows
these
horrible
crimes
doubtless
acts
as
a
deterring
effect
upon
the
negroes
in
that
immediate
neighborhood
for
a
short
time
but
the
lesson
is
not
widely
learned
nor
long
remembered
then
such
crimes
equally
atrocious
have
happened
in
quick
succession
one
in
tennessee
one
in
arkansas
and
one
in
alabama
the
facts
of
the
crime
appear
to
appeal
more
to
the
negro
lustful
imagination
than
the
facts
of
the
punishment
do
to
his
fears
he
sets
aside
all
fear
of
death
in
any
form
when
opportunity
is
found
for
the
gratification
of
his
bestial
desires
there
is
small
reason
to
hope
for
any
change
for
the
better
the
commission
of
this
crime
grows
more
frequent
every
year
the
generation
of
negroes
which
have
grown
up
since
the
war
have
lost
in
large
measure
the
traditional
and
wholesome
awe
of
the
white
race
which
kept
the
negroes
in
subjection
even
when
their
masters
were
in
the
army
and
their
families
left
unprotected
except
by
the
slaves
themselves
there
is
no
longer
a
restraint
upon
the
brute
passion
of
the
negro
what
is
to
be
done
the
crime
of
rape
is
always
horrible
but
the
southern
man
there
is
nothing
which
so
fills
the
soul
with
horror
loathing
and
fury
as
the
outraging
of
a
white
woman
by
a
negro
it
is
the
race
question
in
the
ugliest
vilest
most
dangerous
aspect
the
negro
as
a
political
factor
can
be
controlled
but
neither
laws
nor
lynchings
can
subdue
his
lusts
sooner
or
later
it
will
force
a
crisis
we
do
not
know
in
what
form
it
will
come
in
its
issue
of
june
the
evening
gives
the
following
excuse
for
lynch
law
aside
from
the
violation
of
white
women
by
negroes
which
is
the
outcropping
of
a
bestial
perversion
of
instinct
the
chief
cause
of
trouble
between
the
races
in
the
south
is
the
negro
lack
of
manners
in
the
state
of
slavery
he
learned
politeness
from
association
with
white
people
who
took
pains
to
teach
him
since
the
emancipation
came
and
the
tie
of
mutual
interest
and
regard
between
master
and
servant
was
broken
the
negro
has
drifted
away
into
a
state
which
is
neither
freedom
nor
bondage
lacking
the
proper
inspiration
of
the
one
and
the
restraining
force
of
the
other
he
has
taken
up
the
idea
that
boorish
insolence
is
independence
and
the
exercise
of
a
decent
degree
of
breeding
toward
white
people
is
identical
with
servile
submission
in
consequence
of
the
prevalence
of
this
notion
there
are
many
negroes
who
use
every
opportunity
to
make
themselves
offensive
particularly
when
they
think
it
can
be
done
with
impunity
we
have
had
too
many
instances
right
here
in
memphis
to
doubt
this
and
our
experience
is
not
exceptional
white
people
wo
stand
this
sort
of
thing
and
whether
they
be
insulted
as
individuals
are
as
a
race
the
response
will
be
prompt
and
the
bloody
riot
of
in
which
so
many
negroes
perished
was
brought
on
principally
by
the
outrageous
conduct
of
the
blacks
toward
the
whites
on
the
streets
it
is
also
a
remarkable
and
discouraging
fact
that
the
majority
of
such
scoundrels
are
negroes
who
have
received
educational
advantages
at
the
hands
of
the
white
taxpayers
they
have
got
just
enough
of
learning
to
make
them
realize
how
hopelessly
their
race
is
behind
the
other
in
everything
that
makes
a
great
people
and
they
attempt
to
get
even
by
insolence
which
is
ever
the
resentment
of
inferiors
there
are
negroes
among
us
and
it
is
truly
unfortunate
that
they
should
have
to
pay
even
in
part
the
penalty
of
the
offenses
committed
by
the
baser
sort
but
this
is
the
way
of
the
world
the
innocent
must
suffer
for
the
guilty
if
the
negroes
as
a
people
possessed
a
hundredth
part
of
the
which
is
evidenced
by
the
courteous
bearing
of
some
that
the
could
name
the
friction
between
the
races
would
be
reduced
to
a
minimum
it
will
not
do
to
beg
the
question
by
pleading
that
many
white
men
are
also
stirring
up
strife
the
caucasian
blackguard
simply
obeys
the
promptings
of
a
depraved
disposition
and
he
is
seldom
deliberately
rough
or
offensive
toward
strangers
or
unprotected
women
the
negro
tough
on
the
contrary
is
given
to
just
that
kind
of
offending
and
he
almost
invariably
singles
out
white
people
as
his
victims
on
march
there
were
lynched
in
this
same
city
three
of
the
best
specimens
of
young
manhood
they
were
peaceful
citizens
and
energetic
business
men
they
believed
the
problem
was
to
be
solved
by
eschewing
politics
and
putting
money
in
the
purse
they
owned
a
flourishing
grocery
business
in
a
thickly
populated
suburb
of
memphis
and
a
white
man
named
barrett
had
one
on
the
opposite
corner
after
a
personal
difficulty
which
barrett
sought
by
going
into
the
people
grocery
drawing
a
pistol
and
was
thrashed
by
calvin
mcdowell
he
barrett
threatened
to
clean
them
out
these
men
were
a
mile
beyond
the
city
limits
and
police
protection
hearing
that
barrett
crowd
was
coming
to
attack
them
saturday
night
they
mustered
forces
and
prepared
to
defend
themselves
against
the
attack
when
barrett
came
he
led
a
of
officers
twelve
in
number
who
afterward
claimed
to
be
hunting
a
man
for
whom
they
had
a
warrant
that
twelve
men
in
citizen
clothes
should
think
it
necessary
to
go
in
the
night
to
hunt
one
man
who
had
never
before
been
arrested
or
made
any
record
as
a
criminal
has
never
been
explained
when
they
entered
the
back
door
the
young
men
thought
the
threatened
attack
was
on
and
fired
into
them
three
of
the
officers
were
wounded
and
when
the
party
found
it
was
officers
of
the
law
upon
whom
they
had
fired
they
ceased
and
got
away
men
were
arrested
and
thrown
in
jail
as
conspirators
although
they
all
declared
more
than
once
they
did
not
know
they
were
firing
on
officers
excitement
was
at
fever
beat
until
the
morning
papers
two
days
after
announced
that
the
wounded
deputy
sheriffs
were
out
of
danger
this
hindered
rather
than
helped
the
plans
of
the
whites
there
was
no
law
on
the
statute
books
which
would
execute
an
for
wounding
a
white
man
but
the
unwritten
law
did
three
of
these
men
the
president
the
manager
and
clerk
of
the
grocery
the
leaders
of
the
conspiracy
were
secretly
taken
from
jail
and
lynched
in
a
shockingly
brutal
manner
the
negroes
are
getting
too
independent
they
say
we
must
teach
them
a
lesson
what
lesson
the
lesson
of
subordination
kill
the
leaders
and
it
will
cow
the
negro
who
dares
to
shoot
a
white
man
even
in
although
the
race
was
wild
over
the
outrage
the
mockery
of
law
and
justice
which
disarmed
men
and
locked
them
up
in
jails
where
they
could
be
easily
and
safely
reached
by
the
mob
the
ministers
newspapers
and
leaders
counselled
obedience
to
the
law
which
did
not
protect
them
their
counsel
was
heeded
and
not
a
hand
was
uplifted
to
resent
the
outrage
following
the
advice
of
the
people
left
the
city
in
great
numbers
the
dailies
and
associated
press
reports
heralded
these
men
to
the
country
as
toughs
and
negro
desperadoes
who
kept
a
low
dive
this
same
press
service
printed
that
the
negro
who
was
lynched
at
indianola
in
may
had
outraged
the
sheriff
daughter
the
girl
was
more
than
eighteen
years
old
and
was
found
by
her
father
in
this
man
room
who
was
a
servant
on
the
place
not
content
with
misrepresenting
the
race
the
was
not
to
be
satisfied
until
the
paper
which
was
doing
all
it
could
to
counteract
this
impression
was
silenced
the
colored
people
were
resenting
their
bad
treatment
in
a
way
to
make
itself
felt
yet
gave
the
mob
no
excuse
for
further
murder
until
the
appearance
of
the
editorial
which
is
construed
as
a
reflection
on
the
honor
of
the
southern
white
women
it
is
not
half
so
libelous
as
that
of
the
which
appeared
four
days
before
and
which
has
been
given
in
these
pages
they
would
have
lynched
the
manager
of
the
for
exercising
the
right
of
free
speech
if
they
had
found
him
as
quickly
as
they
would
have
hung
a
rapist
and
glad
of
the
excuse
to
do
so
the
owners
were
ordered
not
to
return
the
was
suspended
with
as
little
compunction
as
the
business
of
the
people
grocery
broken
up
and
the
proprietors
murdered
south

henry
grady
in
his
speeches
in
new
england
and
new

pictured
the
as
incapable
of
through
him
and
other
leading
men
the
cry
of
the
south
to
the
country
has
been
hands
off
leave
us
to
solve
our
problem
to
the
the
south
says
the
white
man
must
and
will
rule
there
is
little
difference
between
the
antebellum
south
and
the
new
south
her
white
citizens
are
wedded
to
any
method
however
revolting
any
measure
however
extreme
for
the
subjugation
of
the
young
manhood
of
the
race
they
have
cheated
him
out
of
his
ballot
deprived
him
of
civil
rights
or
redress
therefor
in
the
civil
courts
robbed
him
of
the
fruits
of
his
labor
and
are
still
murdering
burning
and
lynching
him
the
result
is
a
growing
disregard
of
human
life
lynch
law
has
spread
its
insiduous
influence
till
men
in
new
york
state
pennsylvania
and
on
the
free
western
plains
feel
they
can
take
the
law
in
their
own
hands
with
impunity
especially
where
an
is
concerned
the
south
is
brutalized
to
a
degree
not
realized
by
its
own
inhabitants
and
the
very
foundation
of
government
law
and
order
are
imperilled
public
sentiment
has
had
a
slight
reaction
though
not
sufficient
to
stop
the
crusade
of
lawlessness
and
lynching
the
spirit
of
christianity
of
the
great
church
was
aroused
to
the
frequent
and
revolting
crimes
against
a
weak
people
enough
to
pass
strong
condemnatory
resolutions
at
its
general
conference
in
omaha
last
may
the
spirit
of
justice
of
the
grand
old
party
asserted
itself
sufficiently
to
secure
a
denunciation
of
the
wrongs
and
a
feeble
declaration
of
the
belief
in
human
rights
in
the
republican
platform
at
minneapolis
june
some
of
the
great
dailies
and
weeklies
have
swung
into
line
declaring
that
lynch
law
must
go
the
president
of
the
united
states
issued
a
proclamation
that
it
be
not
tolerated
in
the
territories
over
which
he
has
jurisdiction
governor
northern
and
chief
justice
bleckley
of
georgia
have
proclaimed
against
it
the
citizens
of
chattanooga
have
set
a
worthy
example
in
that
they
not
only
condemn
lynch
law
but
her
public
men
demanded
a
trial
for
weems
the
accused
rapist
and
guarded
him
while
the
trial
was
in
progress
the
trial
only
lasted
ten
minutes
and
weems
chose
to
plead
guilty
and
accept
years
sentence
than
invite
the
certain
death
which
awaited
him
outside
that
cordon
of
police
if
he
had
told
the
truth
and
shown
the
letters
he
had
from
the
white
woman
in
the
case
colyar
of
nashville
is
so
overcome
with
the
horrible
state
of
affairs
that
he
addressed
the
following
earnest
letter
to
the
nothing
since
i
have
been
a
reading
man
has
so
impressed
me
with
the
decay
of
manhood
among
the
people
of
tennessee
as
the
dastardly
submission
to
the
mob
reign
we
have
reached
the
unprecedented
low
level
the
awful
criminal
depravity
of
substituting
the
mob
for
the
court
and
jury
of
giving
up
the
jail
keys
to
the
mob
whenever
they
are
demanded
we
do
it
in
the
largest
cities
and
in
the
country
towns
we
do
it
in
midday
we
do
it
after
full
not
to
say
formal
notice
and
so
thoroughly
and
generally
is
it
acquiesced
in
that
the
murderers
have
discarded
the
formula
of
masks
they
go
into
the
town
where
everybody
knows
them
sometimes
under
the
gaze
of
the
governor
in
the
presence
of
the
courts
in
the
presence
of
the
sheriff
and
his
deputies
in
the
presence
of
the
entire
police
force
take
out
the
prisoner
take
his
life
often
with
fiendish
glee
and
often
with
acts
of
cruelty
and
barbarism
which
impress
the
reader
with
a
degeneracy
rapidly
approaching
savage
life
that
the
state
is
disgraced
but
faintly
expresses
the
humiliation
which
has
settled
upon
the
once
proud
people
of
tennessee
the
state
in
its
majesty
through
its
organized
life
for
which
the
people
pay
liberally
makes
but
one
record
but
one
note
and
that
a
criminal
falsehood
was
hung
by
persons
to
the
jury
unknown
the
murder
at
shelbyville
is
only
a
verification
of
what
every
intelligent
man
knew
would
come
because
with
a
mob
a
rumor
is
as
good
as
a
proof
these
efforts
brought
forth
apologies
and
a
short
halt
but
the
lynching
mania
was
raged
again
through
the
past
three
months
with
unabated
fury
the
strong
arm
of
the
law
must
be
brought
to
bear
upon
lynchers
in
severe
punishment
but
this
can
not
and
will
not
be
done
unless
a
healthy
public
sentiment
demands
and
sustains
such
action
the
men
and
women
in
the
south
who
disapprove
of
lynching
and
remain
silent
on
the
perpetration
of
such
outrages
are
particeps
criminis
accomplices
accessories
before
and
after
the
fact
equally
guilty
with
the
actual
lawbreakers
who
would
not
persist
if
they
did
not
know
that
neither
the
law
nor
militia
would
be
employed
against
them
in
the
creation
of
this
healthier
public
sentiment
the
can
do
for
himself
what
no
one
else
can
do
for
him
the
world
looks
on
with
wonder
that
we
have
conceded
so
much
and
remain
under
such
great
outrage
and
provocation
to
northern
capital
and
labor
the
south
owes
its
rehabilitation
if
labor
is
withdrawn
capital
will
not
remain
the
is
thus
the
backbone
of
the
south
a
thorough
knowledge
and
judicious
exercise
of
this
power
in
lynching
localities
could
many
times
effect
a
bloodless
revolution
the
white
man
dollar
is
his
god
and
to
stop
this
will
be
to
stop
outrages
in
many
localities
the
of
memphis
denounced
the
lynching
of
three
of
their
best
citizens
and
urged
and
waited
for
the
authorities
to
act
in
the
matter
and
bring
the
lynchers
to
justice
no
attempt
was
made
to
do
so
and
the
black
men
left
the
city
by
thousands
bringing
about
great
stagnation
in
every
branch
of
business
those
who
remained
so
injured
the
business
of
the
street
car
company
by
staying
off
the
cars
that
the
superintendent
manager
and
treasurer
called
personally
on
the
editor
of
the
asked
them
to
urge
our
people
to
give
them
their
patronage
again
other
business
men
became
alarmed
over
the
situation
and
the
was
run
away
that
the
colored
people
might
be
more
easily
controlled
a
meeting
of
white
citizens
in
june
three
months
after
the
lynching
passed
resolutions
for
the
first
time
condemning
it
they
did
not
punish
the
every
one
of
them
was
known
by
name
because
they
had
been
selected
to
do
the
dirty
work
by
some
of
the
very
citizens
who
passed
these
resolutions
memphis
is
fast
losing
her
black
population
who
proclaim
as
they
go
that
there
is
no
protection
for
the
life
and
property
of
any
citizen
in
memphis
who
is
not

the
citizens
of

intellectual

financial
improvement
has
been
phenomenal
have
never
had
a
separate

now

from
covington
says
covington
june
the
railroads
of
the
state
are
beginning
to
feel
very
markedly
the
effects
of
the
separate
coach
bill
recently
passed
by
the
legislature
no
class
of
people
in
the
state
have
so
many
and
so
largely
attended
excursions
as
the
blacks
all
these
have
been
abandoned
and
regular
travel
is
reduced
to
a
minimum
a
competent
authority
says
the
loss
to
the
various
roads
will
reach
this
year
a
call
to
a
state
conference
in
lexington
last
june
had
delegates
from
every
county
in
the
state
those
delegates
the
ministers
teachers
heads
of
secret
and
others
orders
and
the
head
of
every
family
should
pass
the
word
around
for
every
member
of
the
race
in
kentucky
to
stay
oil
railroads
unless
obliged
to
ride
if
they
did
so
and
their
advice
was
followed
persistently
the
convention
would
not
need
to
petition
the
legislature
to
repeal
the
law
or
raise
money
to
file
a
suit
the
railroad
corporations
would
be
so
effected
they
would
in
lobby
to
have
the
separate
car
law
repealed
on
the
other
hand
as
long
as
the
railroads
can
get
excursions
they
will
always
have
plenty
of
money
to
fight
all
the
suits
brought
against
them
they
will
be
aided
in
so
doing
by
the
same
partisan
public
sentiment
which
passed
the
law
white
men
passed
the
law
and
white
judges
and
juries
would
pass
upon
the
suits
against
the
law
and
render
judgment
in
line
with
their
prejudices
and
in
deference
to
the
greater
financial
power
the
appeal
to
the
white
man
pocket
has
ever
been
more
effectual
than
all
the
appeals
ever
made
to
his
conscience
nothing
absolutely
nothing
is
to
be
gained
by
a
further
sacrifice
of
manhood
and
by
the
right
exercise
of
his
power
as
the
industrial
factor
of
the
south
the
can
demand
and
secure
his
rights
the
punishment
of
lynchers
and
a
fair
trial
for
accused
rapists
of
the
many
inhuman
outrages
of
this
present
year
the
only
case
where
the
proposed
lynching
did
occur
was
where
the
men
armed
themselves
in
jacksonville
and
paducah
ky
and
prevented
it
the
only
times
an
who
was
assaulted
got
away
has
been
when
he
had
a
gun
and
used
it
in
the
lesson
this
teaches
and
which
every
should
ponder
well
is
that
a
winchester
rifle
should
have
a
place
of
honor
in
every
black
home
and
it
should
be
used
for
that
protection
which
the
law
refuses
to
give
when
the
white
man
who
is
always
the
aggressor
knows
he
runs
as
great
risk
of
biting
the
dust
every
time
his
victim
does
he
will
have
greater
respect
for
life
the
more
the
yields
and
cringes
and
begs
the
more
he
has
to
do
so
the
more
he
is
insulted
outraged
and
lynched
the
assertion
has
been
substantiated
throughout
these
pages
that
the
press
contains
unreliable
and
doctored
reports
of
lynchings
and
one
of
the
most
necessary
things
for
the
race
to
do
is
to
get
these
facts
before
the
public
the
people
must
know
before
they
can
act
and
there
is
no
educator
to
compare
with
the
press
the
papers
are
the
only
ones
which
will
print
the
truth
and
they
lack
means
to
employ
agents
and
detectives
to
get
at
the
facts
the
race
must
rally
a
mighty
host
to
the
support
of
their
journals
and
thus
enable
them
to
do
much
in
the
way
of
investigation
a
lynching
occurred
at
port
jarvis
the
first
week
in
june
a
white
and
colored
man
were
implicated
in
the
assault
upon
a
white
girl
it
was
charged
that
the
white
man
paid
the
colored
boy
to
make
the
assault
which
he
did
on
the
public
highway
in
broad
day
time
and
was
lynched
this
too
was
done
by
parties
unknown
the
white
man
in
the
case
still
lives
he
was
imprisoned
and
promises
to
fight
the
case
on
trial
at
the
preliminary
examination
it
developed
that
he
had
been
a
suitor
of
the
girl
she
had
repulsed
and
refused
him
yet
had
given
him
money
and
he
had
sent
threatening
letters
demanding
more
the
day
before
this
examination
she
was
so
wrought
up
she
left
home
and
wandered
miles
away
when
found
she
said
she
did
so
because
she
was
afraid
of
the
man
testimony
why
should
she
be
afraid
of
the
prisoner
why
should
she
yield
to
his
demands
for
money
if
not
to
prevent
him
exposing
something
he
knew
it
seems
explainable
only
on
the
hypothesis
that
a
existed
between
the
colored
boy
and
the
girl
and
the
white
man
knew
of
it
the
press
is
singularly
silent
has
it
a
motive
we
owe
it
to
ourselves
to
find
out
the
story
comes
from
larned
kansas
that
a
young
white
lady
held
at
bay
until
daylight
without
alarming
any
one
in
the
house
a
burly
negro
who
entered
her
room
and
bed
the
burly
negro
was
promptly
lynched
without
investigation
or
examination
of
inconsistant
stories
a
house
was
found
burned
down
near
montgomery
in
monroe
county
a
few
weeks
ago
also
the
burned
bodies
of
the
owners
and
melted
piles
of
gold
and
silver
these
discoveries
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
awful
crime
was
not
prompted
by
motives
of
robbery
the
suggestion
of
the
whites
was
that
brutal
lust
was
the
incentive
and
as
there
are
nearly
negroes
living
within
a
radius
of
five
miles
of
the
place
the
conclusion
was
inevitable
that
some
of
them
were
the
perpetrators
upon
this
suggestion
probably
made
by
the
real
criminal
the
mob
acted
upon
the
conclusion
and
arrested
ten
four
of
whom
they
tell
the
world
confessed
to
the
deed
of
murdering
richard
johnson
and
outraging
his
daughter
jeanette
these
four
men
berrell
jones
moses
johnson
jim
and
john
packer
none
of
them
years
of
age
upon
this
conclusion
were
taken
from
jail
hanged
shot
and
burned
while
yet
alive
the
night
of
the
same
report
says
johnson
was
on
the
best
of
terms
with
his
negro
tenants
the
race
thus
outraged
must
find
out
the
facts
of
this
awful
hurling
of
men
into
eternity
on
supposition
and
give
them
to
the
indifferent
and
apathetic
country
we
feel
this
to
be
a
garbled
report
but
how
can
we
prove
it
near
vicksburg
a
murder
was
committed
by
a
gang
of
burglars
of
course
it
must
have
been
done
by
negroes
and
negroes
were
arrested
for
it
it
is
believed
that
two
men
smith
tooley
and
john
adams
belonged
to
a
gang
controlled
by
white
men
and
fearing
exposure
on
the
night
of
july
they
were
hanged
in
the
court
house
yard
by
those
interested
in
silencing
them
robberies
since
committed
in
the
same
vicinity
have
been
known
to
be
by
white
men
who
had
their
faces
blackened
we
strongly
believe
in
the
innocence
of
these
murdered
men
but
we
have
no
proof
no
other
news
goes
out
to
the
world
save
that
which
stamps
us
as
a
race
of
cutthroats
robbers
and
lustful
wild
beasts
so
great
is
southern
hate
and
prejudice
they
legally
hung
poor
little
mildrey
brown
at
columbia
on
the
circumstantial
evidence
that
she
poisoned
a
white
infant
if
her
guilt
had
been
proven
unmistakably
had
she
been
white
mildrey
brown
would
never
have
been
hung
the
country
would
have
been
aroused
and
south
carolina
disgraced
forever
for
such
a
crime
the
himself
did
not
know
as
he
should
have
known
as
his
journals
should
be
in
a
position
to
have
him
know
and
act
nothing
is
more
definitely
settled
than
he
must
act
for
himself
i
have
shown
how
he
may
employ
the
boycott
emigration
and
the
press
and
i
feel
that
by
a
combination
of
all
these
agencies
can
be
effectually
stamped
out
lynch
law
that
last
relic
of
barbarism
and
slavery
the
gods
help
those
who
help
themselves
