said
to

the

he
was
sent
by
his
parents
to
the
college
of
chinon
whence
he
entered
the
école
des
arts
et
metiers
and
afterward
went
to
paris
to
work
in
the
shop
of
a
this
was
an
excellent
apprenticeship
for
our
future
electrician
since
it
is
in
small
works
that
electricity
excels
and
if
its
domain
is
to
be
increased
it
is
only
on
condition
that
the
electric
mechanician
shall
never
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
he
should
be
a

that
his

possess

once

titans
and
the
delicacy
of
those
of

it
was
not
long
ere
trouvé
set
up
a
shop
of
his
own
whither
inventors
flocked
in
crowds
and
the
work
he
did
for
these
soon
gave
up
to
him
the
secrets
of
the
art
of
creating
the
first
applications
that
he
attempted
related
to
the
use
of
electricity
in
surgery
a
wonderfully
fecund
branch
but
one
whose
importance
was
scarcely
suspected
notwithstanding
the
results
already
obtained
through
the
application
of
the
insufflation

to
what
the
surgeon
needed
was
to
see
plainly
into
the
cavities
of
the
human
body
trouvé
found
a
means
of
lighting
these
up
with
lamps
whose
illuminating
power
was
fitted
for
that
sort
of
exploration
this
new
mode
of
illumination
having
been
adopted
it
was
but
natural
that
it
should
afterward
find
an
application
in
dangerous
mines
powder
mills
and
for
a
host
of
different
purposes
but
the
perfection
of
this
sort
of
instruments
was
the

the
misfortunes

afterward
directed
trouvé
attention
to
military
electricity
and
led
him
to
devise
a
perfect
system
of
portable
telegraphy
in
which
his
hermetic
pile
lends
itself
perfectly
to
all
maneuvers
and
withstands
all
sorts
of
moving
about
the
small
volume
of
which
we
have
spoken

devoted
more
particularly
to
electric
navigation
for
which
trouvé
specially
designed
the
motor
of
his
invention
and
by
the
aid
of
which
he
performed
numerous
experiments
on
the
ocean
on
the
seine
at
paris
and
before
rouen

at

this
latter

he
kept
ahead
with
so
distinguished
success
we
could
not
undertake

at
the
age
of
years
and
full
of
honor
after
a
life
actively
devoted
to
scientific
work
of
the
highest
and
most
accurate
kind
which
has
contributed
more
than
that
of
any
other
contemporary
to
establish
the
principles
on
which
an
exact
science
like
chemistry
is
founded
the
illustrious
wöhler
has
gone
to
his
rest
after
he
had
worked
for
some
time
with
berzelius
in
sweden
he
taught
chemistry
from
to
at
the
polytechnic
school
in
berlin
then
till
he
was
stationed
at
the
higher
polytechnic
school
at
cassel
and
then
he
became
ordinary
professor
of
chemistry
in
the
university
of
göttingen
where
he
remained
till
his
death
he
was
born
july
at
eschersheim
near
until
the
year
it
was
believed
that
organic
substances
could
only
be
formed
under
the
influence
of
the
vital
force
in
the
bodies
of
animals
and
plants
it
was
wöhler
who
proved
by
the
artificial
preparation
of
urea
from
inorganic
materials
that
this
view
could
not
be
maintained
this
discovery
has
always
been
considered
as
one
of
the
most
important
contributions
to
our
scientific
knowledge
by
showing
that
ammonium
cyanate
can
become
urea
by
an
internal
arrangement
of
its
atoms
without
gaining
or
losing
in
weight
wöhler
furnished
one
of
the
first
and
best
examples
of
isomerism
which
helped
to
demolish
the
old
view
that
equality
of
composition
could
not
coexist
in
two
bodies
a
and
b
with
differences
in
their
respective
physical
and
chemical
properties
two
years
later
in
wöhler
published
jointly
with
liebig
the
results
of
a
research
on
cyanic
and
cyanuric
acid
and
on
urea
berzelius
in
his
report
to
the
swedish
academy
of
sciences
called
it
the
most
important
of
all
researches
in
physics
chemistry
and
mineralogy
published
in
that
year
the
results
obtained
were
quite
unexpected
and
furnished
additional
and
most
important
evidence
in
favor
of
the
doctrine
of
isomerism
in
the
year
wöhler
and
liebig
published
an
investigation
of
the
oil
of
bitter
almonds
they
prove
by
their
experiments
that
a
group
of
carbon
hydrogen
and
oxygen
atoms
can
behave
like
an
element
take
the
place
of
an
element
and
can
be
exchanged
for
elements
in
chemical
compounds
thus
the
foundation
was
laid
of
the
doctrine
of
compound
radicals
a
doctrine
which
has
had
and
has
still
the
most
profound
influence
on
the
development
of
chemistry
so
much
so
that
its
importance
can
hardly
be
exaggerated
since
the
discovery
of
potassium
by
davy
it
was
assumed
that
alumina
also
the
basis
of
clay
contained
a
metal
in
combination
with
oxygen
davy
oerstedt
and
berzelius
attempted
the
extraction
of
this
metal
but
could
not
succeed
wöhler
then
worked
on
the
same
subject
and
discovered
the
metal
aluminum
to
him
also
is
due
the
isolation
of
the
elements
yttrium
beryllium
and
titanium
the
observation
that
silicium
can
be
obtained
in
crystals
and
that
some
meteoric
stones
contain
organic
matter
he
analyzed
a
number
of
meteorites
and
for
many
years
wrote
the
digest
on
the
literature
of
meteorites
in
the
der
he
possessed
perhaps
the
best
private
collection
of
meteoric
stones
and
irons
existing
wöhler
and
sainte
claire
deville
discovered
the
crystalline
form
of
boron
and
wöhler
and
buff
the
hydrogen
compounds
of
silicium
and
a
lower
oxide
of
the
same
element
this
is
by
no
means
a
full
statement
of
wöhler
scientific
work
it
even
does
not
mention
all
the
discoveries
which
have
had
great
influence
on
the
theory
of
chemistry
the
mere
titles
of
the
papers
would
fill
several
pages
the
journals
of
every
year
from
to
contain
contributions
from
his
pen
and
even
his
minor
publications
are
always
interesting
as
was
truly
remarked
ten
years
ago
when
it
was
proposed
by
a
fellow
of
the
royal
society
that
a
copley
medal
should
be
conferred
upon
him
for
two
or
three
of
his
researches
he
deserves
the
highest
honor
a
scientific
man
can
obtain
but
the
sum
of
his
work
is
absolutely
overwhelming
had
he
never
lived
the
aspect
of
chemistry
would
be
very
different
from
that
it
is
now
while
sojourning
at
cassel
wöhler
made
among
other
chemical
discoveries
one
for
obtaining
the
metal
nickel
in
a
state
of
purity
and
with
two
attached
friends
he
founded
a
factory
there
for
the
preparation
of
the
metal
among
the
works
which
he
published
were
grundriss

anorganischen

and
the

nor
must
we
omit
to
mention

and

vols
at
a
sitting
of
the
academy
held
on
october
jean
baptiste
dumas
the
permanent
secretary
with
profound
regret
made
known
the
intelligence
of
the
death
of
the
illustrious
foreign
associate
friedrich
wöhler
professor
in
the
university
of
göttingen
he
said
friedrich
wöhler
the
favorite
pupil
of
berzelius
had
followed
in
the
lines
and
methods
of
work
of
his
master
from
till
his
last
year
he
has
continuously
published
memoirs
or
simple
notes
always
remarkable
for
their
exactness
and
often
of
such
a
nature
that
they
took
among
contemporaneous
production
the
first
rank
by
their
importance
their
novelty
or
their
fullness
employed
chiefly
during
his
sojourn
in
sweden
in
work
on
mineral
chemistry
he
has
remained
all
his
life
the
undisputed
chief
in
this
branch
of
science
in
german
universities
this
preparation
and
preoccupation
which
one
might
have
thought
sufficient
to
occupy
his
time
did
not
however
prevent
him
from
taking
the
chief
part
in
the
development
of
organic
chemistry
and
of
filling
one
of
the
most
elevated
positions
in
it
his
contemporaries
have
not
forgotten
the
unusual
sensation
produced
by
the
unexpected
discovery
by
which
he
was
enabled
to
make
artificially
and
by
a
purely
chemical
method
urea
the
most
nitrogenous
of
animal
substances
other
transformations
or
combinations
giving
birth
to
substances
which
until
then
had
only
been
met
with
in
animals
or
plants
have
since
been
obtained
but
the
artificial
formation
of
urea
still
remains
the
neatest
and
most
elegant
example
of
this
order
of
creation
all
chemists
know
and
admire
the
classical
memoir
in
which
wöhler
and
liebig
some
time
after
made
known
the
nature
of
the
benzoic
series
and
connected
them
with
the
radicals
of
which
we
may
consider
them
as
being
the
derivatives
comparable
with
products
of
a
mineral
nature
their
memoirs
on
the
derivatives
of
uric
acid
a
prolific
source
of
new
and
remarkable
substances
has
been
an
inexhaustible
mine
in
the
hands
of
their
successors
this
is
not
a
moment
when
we
should
pretend
to
review
the
work
which
wöhler
has
done
in
mineral
chemistry
among
the
papers
which
he
has
published
in
scientific
journals
there
are
few
which
the
treatises
of
chemistry
have
not
immediately
turned
to
account
we
need
only
confine
ourselves
to
the
discovery
of
aluminum
to
which
the
energy
and
inventive
genius
of
our
henry
deville
soon
gave
a
place
near
the
noble
metals
united
by
a
rivalry
which
would
have
divided
less
noble
minds
these
two
great
chemists
carried
on
together
their
researches
in
chemistry
and
joined
their
forces
to
clear
up
points
still
obscure
in
the
history
of
boron
silicium
and
the
metals
of
the
platinum
group
and
remained
closely
united
which
each
year
only
strengthened
the
reader
will
pardon
me
a
souvenir
entirely
personal
we
were
born
wöhler

in

am
his
senior
by
a
few
days
our
scientific
life
began
at
the
same
date
and
during
sixty
years
everything
has
combined
to
bind
more
closely
the
links
of
brotherhood
which
has
existed
for
so
long
a
time
our
hebrew
population
the
united
jewish
association
has
made
a
canvass
of
the
denomination
in
this
country
finding
congregations

a

over
its

surface
is
made
in

some
degrees
lower

this
comes
from
the
fact
that
its
waters
are
fresh
from
the
yet
unfathomed
depths
of
the

which
during
the
five
short
months
of

has
scarcely
time
to
properly
unfreeze

in

respects
a

have
to

ferried

too
the

is
so
cold
in
the
region
above
the
lake
that
birds
flying
across

icy
bosom
sometimes
drop
down
dead
on

some
authors
say
that
seals
have
been
caught
in
the
lake
of
the
same
character
as
those
found
in
the
arctic
seas
for
this
assertion
i
have
no
proof
an
immense
caravan
traffic
is
carried
across
the
frozen
lake
every
season
between
russia
and
china
to
accommodate
this
the
russian
postal
authorities
once
established
a
post
house
on
the
middle
of
the
lake
where
horses
were
kept
for
travelers

this
was
discontinued
after
one
winter
when
an

suddenly
set
in
and

all
disappeared
beneath

and
were
never

more
in

the

is
navigated
by
an
antiquated
steamer
called
the
general

which
ventures
out
in
calm
weather
but
can
not
face
the
violent

spinning
without

at
the
recent
meeting
of
the
new
england
cotton
manufacturers
association
held
at
the
institute
of
technology
boston
the
following
paper
on
the
harris
system
of
revolving
ring
spinning
was
read
by
webber
for
the
author
it
is
well
known
that
one
of
the
most
serious
difficulties
in
ring
spinning
is
the
variable
pull
upon
the
traveler
caused
by
the
difference
in
diameter
of
the
full
and
empty
bobbins
and
this
is
especially
noticeable
in
spinning
weft
or
filling
when
the
diameter
of
the
quill
at
the
tip
is
not
over
of
an
inch
while
that
of
the
base
of
the
cone
or
full
bobbin
is
from
an
inch
to
an
inch
and
this
variation
in
diameter
causes
the
line
of
draught
upon
the
traveler
which
with
the
full
bobbin
forms
nearly
a
tangent
to
the
interior
circle
of
the
ring
to
be
nearly
radial
to
it
with
an
empty
one
and
this
increased
drag
upon
the
traveler
not
only
causes
frequent
breakage
in
spinning
but
also
stretches
the
yarn
so
that
it
is
perceptibly
finer
when
it
is
spun
on
the
nose
of
the
bobbin
than
when
it
is
spun
on
the
bottom
of
the
cone
endeavors
have
been
made
to
compensate
for
this
difficulty
by
making
a
less
draught
at
that
period
of
the
operation
but
we
believe
the
principle
of
curing
one
error
by
adding
another
to
be
wrong
and
aim
by
our
improvement
to
avoid
the
cause
of
the
trouble
which
we
do
by
giving
a
revolving
motion
to
the
ring
itself
in
the
same
direction
as
that
of
the
traveler
at
a
variable
speed
so
as
to
aid
its
slip
and
reduce
its
friction
on
the
ring
this
we
accomplish
by
means
of
a
shaft
with
whorls
on
it
located
directly
over
the
drum
for
driving
the
spindle
from
which
bands
drive
each
ring
separately
and
attached
by
to
the
and
moving
up
and
down
with
it
this
shaft
is
driven
by
a
pair
of
conical
drums
from
the
main
cylinder
shaft
and
is
so
arranged
with
a
loose
pulley
on
the
large
end
of
the
receiving
cone
as
to
remain
stationary
while
the
wind
is
on
or
near
the
base
of
the
bobbin
or
nearly
parallel
to
the
path
of
the
traveler
when
the
cone
of
the
bobbin
begins
to
diminish
to
such
a
point
as
to
materially
increase
the
radial
pull
on
the
traveler
these
conical
drums
are
put
in
operation
by
a
belt
shipper
attached
to
the
lift
motion
which
moves
the
belt
on
to
the
cones
and
gives
a
continually
accelerated
motion
to
the
rings
so
that
when
the
wind
reaches
the
top
of
the
bobbin
the
rings
will
have
their
maximum
speed
of
about
revolutions
per
minute
or
about
the
number
of
revolutions
of
the
spindle
at
this
point
if
the
latter
make
revolutions
per
minute
and
this
we
find
in
actual
practice
to
produce
results
which
are
highly
satisfactory
as
the
lift
falls
again
the
belt
is
moved
back
on
the
cones
giving
a
retarding
motion
to
the
rings
until
it
reaches
the
point
at
which
it
began
to
operate
and
is
then
either
moved
on
to
the
loose
pulley
and
the
rings
remain
stationary
or
for
very
fine
yarn
are
kept
in
motion
at
a
slow
speed
we
are
often
asked
if
this
does
not
affect
the
twist
but
answer
that
it
does
not
in
the
least
as
the
relative
speeds
of
the
rolls
and
spindles
remain
the
same
and
the
only
thing
that
can
be
affected
is
the
hardness
of
the
wind
upon
the
bobbin
and
this
is
adjustable
by
the
use
of
a
heavier
or
lighter
traveler
according
to
the
compactness
of
cop
required
we
claim
by
means
of
this
improvement
the
ability
to
use
a
much
smaller
quill
or
bobbin
and
consequently
holding
as
much
yarn
in
a
less
outside
diameter
enabling
us
to
use
a
smaller
ring
thus
saving
power
both
in
the
weight
of
bobbin
to
be
carried
and
in
the
distance
to
be
moved
by
the
traveler
and
we
believe
the
power
to
be
saved
in
this
manner
and
by
the
diminution
of
the
dead
pull
on
the
traveler
when
the
wind
is
at
the
tip
of
the
bobbin
to
be
more
than
sufficient
to
give
the
necessary
motion
to
the
revolving
rings
we
are
as
yet
unable
to
answer
this
question
of
power
fully
as
we
have
not
yet
tested
a
full
size
frame
but
we
propose
to
do
this
in
season
to
answer
all
questions
at
the
next
meeting
of
your
association
the
same
invention
is
also
applicable
to
warp
spinning
by
giving
the
ring
a
continuous
accelerating
and
retarding
motion
in
which
the
maximum
speed
is
given
to
the
ring
at
the
first
start
of
the
frame
when
the
bobbin
is
empty
sufficient
to

but
from

it
was
suggested
by
a
member
that
the
only
advantage

a
revolving

was
to
relieve
the

to
the
extent

were
making

and
the
traveler
the
strain
on
the

would
be
equal
to
revolutions
on
a
stationary
ring
webber
however
thought
that
the
motion
of
the
ring
gave
the
traveler
a
lift
that
prevented
its
stopping
at
any
particular
point
and
cited
the
fact
that
all
numbers
up
to
could
be
spun
with
this
ring
as
proof
of
its
superiority
over
the

new

at

things
with
a

confidence
of
the

in
the
minds
of
timid

proprietors
among
others
he
mentioned
the
advances
now
being
made
by

in
regard
to
improved
appliances
for
developing
the
illuminating
power
of
coal
gas
with
especial

to
a
new
burner
just
patented
by
grimston
livesey
passed
a
very
high
encomium
upon
the
burner
and
this
expression
of
opinion
by
such
an
authority
is
sufficient
to
arouse
deep
interest
in
the
apparatus
in
question
it
is
therefore
with
much
pleasure
that
we
present
our
readers
with
the
following
early
account
of
burner
for
which
we
are
indebted
to
the
inventor
and
george
bower
of
neots
in
whose
manufactory
the
burners
are
now
being
made
in
all
sizes
it
should
be
premised
to
save
disappointment
that
the
invention
is
yet
so
fresh
that
its
ultimate
capabilities
are
unknown
the
accompanying
illustration
therefore
represents
the
bare
skeleton
of
one
of
the
first
models
and
the
actual
performance
of
only
the
very
earliest
burner
made
in
great
part
by
grimston
himself
has
been
fully
tested
before
proceeding
to
describe
the
invention
a
brief
history
may
be
interesting
of
how
it
happened
that
grimston
an
electric
lighting
engineer
became
a
gas
burner
maker
the
story
will
undoubtedly
help
to
explain
the
reasons
for
many
of
the
characteristics
of
the
new
burner
illustration
improved

fig
sectional
elevation
it
appears
then
that
grimston
who
was
connected
with
the
electrical
engineering
establishment
of
siemens
limited
was
some
months
ago
shown
the
construction
and
working
of
the
siemens
regenerative
gas
burner
which
is
now
sufficiently
well
known
to
render
a
description
unnecessary
here
in
common
with
most
spectators
of
this
very
ingeniously
and
philosophically
designed
appliance
grimston
was
struck
with
its
bulk
and
the
superficial
clumsiness
of
the
arrangement
whereby
the
air
and
gas
supply
are
heated
in
it
by
the
products
of
combustion
these
lamps
have
of
course
materially
improved
of
late
but
when
grimston
first
saw
them
perhaps
months
ago
they
certainly
could
not
be
called
neat
and
compact
in
design
he
at
once
grasped
the
idea
embodied
in
these
lamps
and
set
about
constructing
an
arrangement
which
should
be
based
on
a
similar
principle
but
at
the
same
time
avoid
the
inconveniences
complained
of
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
he
has
succeeded
in
both
these
aims
and
the
burner
which
now
bears
his
name
strikes
the
observer
at
once
by
the
brilliant
light
which
it
produces
by
the
simplest
and
most
obvious
means
we
may
now
describe
by
reference
to
the
accompanying
illustrations
how
grimston
produces

is
evident
that
the
number

might
be
increased
so
as
to
abstract
almost
all
the
heat
from

but
for
the
limitations
imposed
first
by
a
consideration
of
the
actual
quantity
of
air
required
to
support
combustion
and
secondly
by
the
obligation
to
let
sufficient
ascensional
power
remain
in
the
gases
which
are
left
to
pass
out
through
the
upper
chimney
if
the

are
cooled

they
will
either
fall
back
into

and
extinguish

flame
or
will
be
removable
only
by
the
draught
of
a
long
chimney
it
will
probably
be
the
aim
of
the
inventor
to
balance
these
requirements
and
so
to
produce
burners
with
very
short
or
longer
chimneys
according
as
appearance
is
to
be
consulted
or
the
highest
possible
effect
produced
the
burner
is
a
ring
of
brass
tubes
of
considerable
diameter
in
proportion
to
the
quantity
of
gas
consumed
and
thus
provides
for
the
delivery
of
gas
expanded
by
heat
in
connection
with
this
device
an
explanation
may
be
found
of
the
failure
of
the
british
association
committee
on
gas
burners
to
find
any
advantage
from
previously
heating
the
air
and
gas
consumed
the
committee
did
not
make
the
necessary
provision
for
the
increased
bulk
of
the
combustible
and
its
air
supply
caused
by
their
heightened
temperature
and
the
same
quantity
of
gas
measured
cold
at
the
meter
could
only
be
driven
through
the
ordinary
small
burner
holes
at
a
velocity
destructive
of
good
results
herr
frederick
siemens
perceived
this
in
his
early
experiments
and
not
only
increased
the
orifices
of
his
burners
but
provided
for
the
closer
contact
of
the
more
rarefied
gas
and
air
by
the
use
of
notched
deflectors
which
are
now
an
essential
part
of
his
apparatus
grimston
also
uses
separate
tubes
of
large
area
for
his
hot
gas
but
dispenses
with
deflectors
save
in
so
far
as
the
same
duty
may
be
performed
by
the
plain
lower
edge
of
the
inner
cylinder
of
the
lamp
body
and
the
indentation
of
the
glass
beneath
which
as
will
be
noticed
is
made
to
follow
the
shape
of
the
flame
it
only
remains
now
to
speak
of
the
flame
and
its
qualities
it
is
in
the
first
place
a
flame
of
hot
gas
burning
at
an
extremly
small
velocity
of
flow
and
wholly
exposed
to
view
from
the
exact
point
which
it
is
required
to
light
in
this
latter
respect
it
differs
materially
and
with
advantage
from
the
siemens
burner
which
while
presenting
an
extremely
brilliant
and
beautiful
ball
of
flame
outside
its
central
tube
of
porcelain
may
yet
be
tailing
smokily
downward
inside
this
opaque
screen
and
thereby
causing
unperceived
waste
the
flame
of
the
grimston
burner
on
the
other
hand
is
quite
exposed
and
all
its
light
from
the
ends
of
the
to
the
point
where
visible
combustion
ceases
is
made
available
for
use
as
a
perfect
argand
flame
in
the
usual
position
has
been
likened
in
form
to
a
tulip
flower
so
the
flame
of
this
burner
presents
the
appearance
of
an
inverted
convolvulus
so
far
as
he
has
already
gone
grimston
prefers
to
keep
the
tubes
of
the
burner
at
such
a
distance
from
each
other
that
the
several
jets
part
at
the
point
where
they
turn
upward
so
that
the
convolvulus
figure
is
not
maintained
to
the
edge
of
the
flame
from
its
peculiar
position
the
light
is
of
course
completely
shadowless
as
regards
the
lamp
which
affords
it
and
this
of
itself
is
no
small
recommendation
for
a
pendant
it
shows
well
for
the
simplicity
and
effectiveness
of
the
perfected
burners
that
grimston
experimental
example
although
necessarily
imperfect
in
many
ways
burns
with
a
remarkably
steady
light
of
great
brilliancy
which
is
assured
by
the
fact
that
the
products
of
combustion
are
robbed
of
all
their
heat
to
magnify
the
useful
effect
so
that
the
hand
may
be
borne
with
ease
over
the
outlet
of
the
chimney
with
respect
to
the
endurance
of
the
apparatus
it
will
be
sufficient
to
remark
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
gas
or
air
heating
arrangements
to
get
out
of
order
and
they
are
all
easily
accessible
while
the
burner
is
in
action
the
glass
is
not
liable
to
breakage
although
it
is
in
close
proximity
to
the
flame
as
may
be
gathered
from
the
testimony
of
the
inventor
who
has
never
broken
one
notwithstanding
the
severity
of
some
of
his
experimental
studies
upon
his
first
lamp
the
consumption
of
gas
in
the
first
burner
made
by
grimston
was
cubic
feet
per
hour
and
its
illuminating
power
averaged
candles
the
diameter
of
this
burner
was
inches
across
the
tubes
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
state
that
if
this
high
duty
which
was
obtained
with
the
ordinary
gas
of
the
gaslight
and
coke
company
can
be
maintained
to
say
nothing
of
being
exceeded
in
the
commercial
article
the
grimston
burner
with
its
other
advantages
over
all
existing
methods
of
obtaining
equal
results
has
a
great
future
before
it
for
example
it
does
not
require
a
separate
air
supply
under
high
pressure
or
any
extra
material
to
render
incandescent
and
it
may
be
turned
on
full
immediately
upon
lighting
it
throws
a
shadowless
light
and
lends
itself
to
ventilating
arrangements
and
it
is
not
by
any
means
cumbersome
delicate
in
construction
or
costly
in
manufacture
one
of
the
greatest
advantages
to
which
it
lays
claim
is
however
the
power
of
yielding
almost
as
good
results
in
a
small
burner
as
in
a
large
one
this
is
a
consideration
of
great
moment
when
it
is
remembered
that
the
tendency
of
most
of
the
high
power
burners
hitherto
introduced
is
to
benefit
the
lighting
of
streets
large
interiors
and
generally
speaking
points
of
great
consumption
meanwhile
the
private
user
of
burners
consuming
from
to
cubic
feet
of
gas
per
hour
has
been
left
to
attain
as
best
he
might
by
the
use
of
burners
excellent
of
their
kind
to
the
maximum
effect
of
the
standard
argand
now
however
grimston
seeks
to
make
the
small
consumer
partake
of
the
advantages
erstwhile
reserved
for
the
wholesale
user
of
large
and
costly
siemens
and
other
lamps
and
he
even
looks
to
this
class
of
patrons
with
particular
care
the
example
which
we
now
illustrate
in
fig
is
a
sectional
presentment
precisely
half
the
actual
size
of
a
burner
which
it
is
intended
to
prepare
for
the
market
before
all
others
another
simple
form
of
the
burner
with
vertical
tubes
will
we
understand
be
introduced
as
soon
as
possible
it
will
be
readily
understood
that
the
principle
is
capable
of
being
embodied
in
many
shapes
and
it
is

has
made
several
forms
both
of

defty
has
sought
in

to
apply
the
principle
of
heating

in
a
simple
manner
with
the
object
of
obtaining
improved

tried
many
years

here
we
have
the
a

b
for
heating
the

supplied
to
an
ordinary

causing
it
to
pass
downward
between

inward
to
the
point
of
combustion
through
a
screen
c
under
the
inner
chimney
but
in
addition
thereto
defty
hopes
to
gain
an
improved
result
by
causing
the
gas
to
pass
through
the
internal
tube
s
which
rises
up
in
the
middle
of
the

the
gas
which
enters

made
to
pass
up
through

down
through
the
annular

there
is
an
attempt
made
to
heat
the

heat
of
the
products

it
will
be
perceived
by

is
furnished
with
a
double

partly
filled
with
the
convoluted
a
which
also
takes
up
some
of
the
waste
heat
and
delivers
the
gas
to
the
burner
at
a
correspondingly
high
temperature
a
very
simple
method
of
lighting
this
burner
which
in
itself
does
not
present
anything
remarkable
is
arranged
at
the
lower
part
of
the
globe
where
a
hole
is
cut

a
loose
conical
glass
plug
which
can
of
course
be
made
to
partake
of
the
general

be
pushed
up

of
the
passage
of

then
dropped
in
its
place
again
formal
tests
of
the
performances
of
these
burners

not
available

the

may
be
said
of
the
heating
burners
which
are
shown
in
the
following
diagrams
illustration
fig
the
first
of

called
by

is
designed
to
heat
the
mixture
of
air

ignition
by
conduction
from
its
own

the
inventor
claims
to
effect
a
perfect
combustion
in
this
manner
with
considerable
economy
of
fuel
it
is
evident
however
that
a
good
deal
of
the
gas
consumed
goes
to
heat
the
burner
itself
illustration

the
next
and
last
of
defty
productions
to
be
at

described
is
the
crater
burner
shown
herewith

this

an
atmospheric
burner
which
is
purposely
made
to
fire
back
as
well
as
to
burn
on
the
top
of
the
apparatus
the
body
of
the
burner
like
the
pyramid
heater
just
described
is
full
of
balls
which
become
very
hot
from
the
lower
flame
and
thus
after
the
burner
has
been
for
some
time
in
action
a
pale
lambent
blaze
crowns
the

apparently
greater
in
volume
than
when
it
is
first
lighted

there
is
a
lamentable
absence
of
reliable
data
as
to
economic
results
which
will
perhaps
be
afforded
when
the

in
question
is
ready
to
be
offered
to
the
public

one
inventor

another
succeeds
in
distancing
his

this
is
an
open
field
which
affords
scope
for
more
workers

there
is
the
certainty
of

sufficiently
to
allow

next
a

and
the

rolled
between

as
a
consequence
the
number
of
revolutions
made
is
so
much
the
greater
in
proportion
as
the
diameter
of
the
shaft
is
smaller
with
respect
to
that
of
the
cylinders
it
should
be
remarked
that
the
bar
during
its
rotation
under
pressure
is
held
by
the
guide
c
so
that
its
diagrammatic
axis
fig
exceeds
the
line
a
a
joining
the
centers
of
the
cylinders
just
enough
to
prevent
its
escape
to
the
opposite
and
so
that
the
pressure
upon
the
said
guide
which
performs
the
role
of
scraper
is
merely
sufficient
to
detach
the
scales
which
form
during
the
operation
under
such
conditions
and
at
a
velocity
of
revolutions
per
minute
in
the
two
cylinders
it
will
take
but
a
fraction
of
a
minute
to
finish
a
bar
the
length
of
the
table
that
is
to
say
meters
then
by
loosening
the
upper
cylinder
the
bar
may
be
easily
shoved
along
in
one
direction
or
the
other
so
as
to
continue
the
finishing
operation
on
successive
lengths
this
moving
of
the
bar
forward
is
further
facilitated
by
the
aid
of
a
clamp
with
rollers
and
a
movable
socket
v

for
large
diameters

and
beyond

employed
by
the

small
windlasses
placed
opposite
each
other

at
a
distance

twice
the
greatest
length
of
the

the
chains
of

or
of
any
other
part
of
the
bar
it
is
only
necessary
to
lower
the
lever
of
one
them
by
reason
of
the
contrary
rotation
of
the
bar
the
effective
stress
on
the
lever
will
be
very
moderate
while
the
cut
produced
will
be
a
clean
and
quickly
performed
one
it
should
be
remarked
that
as
a
consequence
of
the
cone
on
the
projecting
extremity
of
the
cylinder
journals

on
the
rollers
that
control

it
is
only
necessary
to
move
the
lever

the
right

to
stop
the
motion
of
each
of
the

these
latter
to
prevent
all
possibility
of

are
inclosed
within
semicircular
guards
finally
the
controlling
rollers
are
made
of
a
material

is
quite
elastic

there
might
likewise
be
finished
axles

as
those
provided

the

may
if
preferred
be
driven
by
small
special
motors
affixed
to
the
frame
such
an
arrangement
which
is
more
costly
than
the
preceding
is
nevertheless
indicated
in

the
weight

thrown
away
which
can
not
be
admitted
into
the
sewers
in
towns
where
the
excreta
are
separated
by
means
of
water
closets
the
disposal
of
the
other
refuse
presents
less
difficulty
but
still
a
considerable
one
because
the
animal

refuse
is
not
kept
separate
from
the
cinders
and
ashes
all
being
thrown
together
into
the
ash

the

therefore
can
not
be
deposited
upon
ground
which
may
afterward
be
built
upon
although
that
custom
obtained
generally
in

the

in

perhaps
in

have

many
theoretical

been
promulgated
as
in
the
collotype

process
as
our
readers
are
aware
we
have
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
collotype
printing
in
operation
in
several
european
establishments
of
note
and
have
from
time
to
time
published
in
these
columns
our
experiences
but
requests
still
come
to
us
so
frequently
for
information
on
the
process
that
we
have
deemed
it
well
to
make
a
practical
summary
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
working
or
desire
to
work
the
method
the
formulæ
and
manipulations
here
set
down
are
those
of
löwy
albert
allgeyer
and
obernetter
four
of
the
best
authorities
on
the
subject
and
we
can
assure
our
readers
there
is
nothing
described
but
what
is
actually
practiced
plate
for
the
printing
herr
albert
of
munich
uses
patent
plate
of
nearly
half
an
inch
in
thickness
as
most
of
his
work
is
printed
upon
the
schnell
press
machine
press
herr
obernetter
of
vienna
since
he
only
employs
the
slower
and
more
careful
hand
press
prefers
plate
glass
of
ordinary
thickness
as
being
handier
in
manipulation
and
better
adapted
to
the
common
herr
löwy
of
vienna
again
uses
plate
glass
a
quarter
of
an
inch
thick
as
his
productions
range
from
the
finest
to
the
roughest
coating
of
the
glass
herr
albert
original
plan
was
to
apply
a
preliminary
coating
of
bichromated
gelatine
to
the
thick
glass
plate
the
film
being
exposed
to
light
through
the
back
of
the
glass
and
thus
rendered
insoluble
and
tightly
cemented
to
the
surface
this
film
serving
as
a
basis
for
the
second
sensitive
coating
that
was
afterward
impressed
by
the
negative
this
double
treatment
is
now
definitely
abandoned
in
most
lichtdruck
establishments
and
instead
a
preliminary
coating
of
soluble
silicate
and
albumen
dissolved
in
water
is
used
herr
löwy
method
and
formula
are
as
follows
the
glass
plate
is
cleaned
and
coated
with
soluble
glass
parts
white
of
egg
water
to
the
soluble
glass
must
be
free
from
caustic
potash
the
mixture
which
must
be
used
fresh
is
carefully
filtered
and
spread
evenly
over
the
previously
cleaned
glass
plate
the
superfluous
liquid
is
flowed
off
and
the
film
dried
either
spontaneously
or
by
slightly
warming
the
film
is
generally
dry
in
a
few
minutes
when
it
is
rinsed
with
water
and
again
dried
at
this
stage
the
plate
bears
an
open
porous
film
slightly
opalescent
so
slight
however
as
only
to
be
observed
by
an
experienced
eye
of
the
sensitive
we
now
come
to
the
second
stage
of
the
process
the
application
of
a
film
of
bichromated
gelatine
to
the
plate
herr
löwy
formula
is
as
follows
bichromate
of
potash
grammes
gelatine
ounces
water
to
according
to
the
weather
the
amount
of
water
must
be
varied
but
in
any
case
the
solution
is
a
very
fluid
one
an
ounce
is
about
grammes
as
most
of
our
readers
know
a
practical
collotypist
sees
at
a
glance
the
quality
of
the
prepared
plate
without
any
preliminary
testing
a
good
preliminary
film
is
a
glass
that
is
transparent
yet
slightly
dull
the
film
is
so
thin
you
can
scarcely
believe
it
is
there
the
plate
is
slightly
warmed
upon
a
slate
slab
underneath
which
is
a
water
bath
it
is
then
flooded
with
the
above
mixture
of
bichromated
gelatine
leaving
only
sufficient
to
make
a
very
thin
film
when
coated
the
plate
is
placed
in
the
drying
chamber
the
sensitive
much
depends
upon
the
drying
a
water
bath
with
gas
burner
underneath
is
used
for
heating
and
a
slate
slab
perfectly
level
receives
the
glass
plate
the
drying
chamber
is
kept
at
an
even
temperature
of
the
object
to
be
attained
is
a
fine
grain
throughout
the
surface
of
the
gelatine
and
unless
this
grain
is
satisfactory
the
finished
printing
block
never
will
be
if
the
gelatine
film
be
too
thick
then
the
grain
will
be
coarse
or
again
if
the
temperature
in
drying
be
too
high
there
will
be
no
grain
at
all
the
drying
is
complete
in
two
or
three
hours
and
should
not
take
longer
negative
to
be
printed
the
sensitive
film
being
upon
the
surface
of
a
thick
glass
plate
it
is
necessary
that
the
cliché
or
negative
employed
should
be
upon
patent
plate
or
not
upon
glass
at
all
so
as
to
insure
perfect
contact
best
of
all
is
to
employ
a
stripped
negative
in
which
case
absolute
contact
is
insured
in
printing
it
is
only
in
these
circumstances
that
the
most
perfect
impression
can
be
secured
if
the
negative
is
otherwise
satisfactory
and
only
requires
stripping
it
must
be
upon
a
leveling
stand
and
fluid
gelatine
of
a
tolerable
consistence
is
poured
over
it
when
dry
a
is
run
around
the
margin
and
the
film
leaves
the
glass
without
any
trouble
herr
obernetter
says
that
many
of
the
negatives
he
receives
have
to
be
reproduced
before
they
can
be
transformed
into
lichtdruck
plates
and
he
employs
either
the
wet
collodion
process
or
the
graphite
method
according
to
circumstances
if
the
copy
is
desired
to
be
softer
than
the
original
collodion
is
employed
if
vigor
be
desired
graphite
is
used
and
here
is
his
formula
dextrine
grains
ordinary
white
sugar
bichromate
of
ammonia
water
ounces
glycerine
to
drops
the
film
is
dried
at
a
temperature
of
to
in
about
ten
minutes
and
while
still
warm
is
printed
under
a
negative
in
diffused
light
for
a
period
of
five
to
fifteen
minutes
in
a
print
the
image
is
slightly
visible
the
plate
is
again
warmed
a
little
above
atmospheric
temperature
in
a
darkened
room
and
then
fine
levigated
graphite
is
applied
with
a
fine
dusting
brush
a
sheet
of
white
paper
being
held
underneath
to
judge
of
the
effect
breathing
upon
the
film
renders
it
more
capable
of
attracting
the
powder
when
the
desired
vigor
has
been
attained
the
superfluous
powder
is
dusted
off
and
the
plate
coated
with
normal
collodion
afterward
the
film
is
cut
through
at
the
margins
of
the
plate
by
means
of
a
sharp
knife
and
put
into
water
in
a
little
while
from
two
to
five
minutes
the
collodion
with
the
image
will
be
detached
from
the
glass
the
film
is
at
once
turned
over
in
the
water
and
brought
out
upon
the
glass
plate
under
a
soft
jet
of
water
any
that
may
exist
between
the
collodion
and
the
glass
are
removed
and
then
a
solution
of
gum
arabic
two
grammes
of
gum
dissolved
in
one
hundred
grammes
of
water
is
poured
over
and
the
film
is
allowed
to
dry
spontaneously
of
the
printing
block
under
the
the
exposure
is
very
rapid
any
one
conversant
with
photolithographic
work
will
understand
this
at
any
rate
every
photographer
knows
that
bichromated
gelatine
is
much
more
rapid
than
the
chloride
of
silver
he
generally
has
to
do
with
there
is
no
other
way
of
measuring
the
exposure
than
by
the
photometer
or
personal
experience
and
the
latter
is
by
far
the
best
after
leaving
the
printing
frame
the
plate
is
immersed
in
cold
water
here
it
remains
at
discretion
for
half
an
hour
or
an
hour
the
purpose
of
course
being
to
wash
out
the
soluble
bichromate
it
is
when
the
print
comes
out
of
this
bath
that
judgment
is
passed
upon
it
an
experienced
eye
tells
at
once
what
it
is
fit
for
if
it
is
yellow
the
yellowness
must
be
of
the
slightest
indeed
herr
furkl
the
manager
of
herr
löwy
lichtdruck
department
will
not
admit
that
a
good
plate
is
yellow
at
all
a
yellow
tint
means
that
it
will
take
up
too
much
ink
when
the
roller
is
passed
over
it
the
plates
of
herr
obernetter
however
are
rather
more
yellow
than
herr
löwy
certainly
only
a
tinge
but
still
yellow
and
herr
obernetter
work
proves
at
any
rate
that
the
yellowish
tinge
is
by
no
means
inseparable
from
good
results
the
washed
and
dried
plate
should
appear
like
a
design
of
ground
and
polished
glass
the
ground
glass
appearance
is
given
by
the
grain
if
there
are
pure
almost
transparent
and
opalescent
shadows
the
plate
is
a
good
one
from
the
we
have
now
a
ready
for
the
press
if
it
is
to
be
printed
by
machinery
that
is
to
say
upon
a
schnell
press
the
surface
is
etched
if
it
has
to
be
more
carefully
handled
in
a
hand
press
etching
is
rarely
resorted
to
it
is
moistened
only
with
glycerine
and
water
to
etch
a
plate
for
a
schnell
press
it
is
placed
upon
a
leveling
stand
and
the
following
solution
is
poured
upon
it
glycerine
parts
ammonia
nitrate
of
potash
saltpeter
water
another
equally
good
formula
recommended
by
allgeyer
who
managed
herr
albert
lichtdruck
printing
for
some
years
is
glycerine
parts
water
chloride
of
sodium
common
salt
in
lieu
of
common
salt
parts
of
hyposulphite
of
soda
or
other
hygroscopic
salt
such
as
chloride
of
calcium
may
be
employed
the
etching
fluid
is
permitted
to
remain
upon
the
image
for
half
an
hour
during
this
time
by
gently
moving
the
finger
to
and
fro
over
the
surface
the
swelling
or
relief
of
the
image
can
be
distinctly
felt
the
plate
is
not
washed
but
the
etching
fluid
simply
poured
off
so
that
the
film
remains
impregnated
with
the
glycerine
and
water
at
the
most
a
piece
of
bibulous
paper
is
used
to
absorb
any
superfluous
quantity
of
the
etching
fluid
after
etching
the
plate
is
taken
straight
to
the
printing
press
the
inking
up
and
printing
are
done
very
much
as
in
lithography
if
it
requires
a
practiced
hand
to
produce
a
good
lithographic
print
it
stands
to
reason
that
in
dealing
with
a
gelatine
printing
block
instead
of
a
stone
skill
and
practice
are
more
necessary
still
therefore
at
this
point
the
photographer
should
hand
over
the
work
to
the
lithographer
or
rather
the
lichtdruck
printer
it
is
only
by
coaxing
judiciously
with
roller
and
sponge
that
a
good
printing
block
can
be
obtained
and
no
amount
of
teaching
theoretically
can
beget
a
good
printer
to
appreciate
how
skillful
a
printer
must
be
it
is
only
necessary
to
see
the
imperfect
proofs
that
first
result
and
to
watch
how
these
are
gradually
improved
by
dint
of
rolling
rubbing
etching
cleaning
etc
in
all
lichldruck
establishments
two
kinds
of
rollers
are
used
of
leather
and
glue
in
some
establishments
too
they
employ
two
kinds
of
ink
but
herr
löwy
manages
to
secure
delicacy
and
vigor
at
the
same
time
by
using
one
ink
but
rolling
up
with
two
kinds
of
roller
collotype
printing
is
not
merely
done
by
hand
presses
but
is
also
done
by
machinery
at
herr
albert
a
gas
engine
of
power
is
employed
to
drive
the
machines
and
each
machine
requires
the
attention
of
a
skilled
mechanic
and
a
girl
the
press
is
very
like
the
lithographic
quick
press
upon
a
big
steel
bed
lies
the
little
collotype
block
the
glass
printing
block
with
its
brownish
film
of
gelatine
moves
horizontally
to
and
fro
and
as
it
does
so
passes
under
half
a
dozen
rollers
which
not
only
supply
ink
but
disperse
it
some
of
the
rollers
are
of
leather
and
others
of
glue
and
whenever
the
printing
block
retires
from
underneath
them
an
ink
slab
takes
the
place
of
the
block
and
imparts
more
ink
to
the
rollers
sometimes
as
many
as
eight
rollers
are
used
for
the
difficulty
of
machine
printing
is
to
apply
the
ink
as
delicately
and
equally
as
possible
it
is
necessary
at
intervals
to
damp
the
block
and
when
the
printer
in
charge
finds
this
to
be
the
case
he
stops
the
press
and
applies
a
little
glycerine
and
water
with
a
cloth
or
sponge
then
a
leather
roller
is
passed
over
to
remove
superfluous
moisture
and
the
press
is
again
started

valuable
and
up
to
the
present
time
the
least
generally
appreciated
services
that
electricity
can
render
for
domestic
purposes
is
that
of
its
application
in
lighters
at
the
present
epoch
of
indifferent
matches
to
have
instantaneously
a
light
by
pulling
a
cord
pressing
on
a
button
or
turning
a
cock
is
a
thing
worthy
of
being
taken
into
serious
consideration
and
our
own
personal
experience
permits
us
to
assert
that
regarded
from
this
point
of
view
electricity
is
capable
of
daily
rendering
inappreciable
services
according
to
the
nature
of
the
application
that
is
to
be
made
of
them
the
places
in
which
they
are
to
be
put
and
the
combustible
that
they
are
to
inflame
electric
lighters
vary
greatly
in
form
and
arrangement
we
shall
limit
ourselves
here
to
pointing
out
the
simplest
and
most
practical
of
the
numerous
models
of
such
apparatus
that
have
been
constructed
up
to
the
present
time
all
those
that
we
shall
describe
are
based
on
the
incandescence
of
a
platinum
wire
a
few
have
been
constructed
based
on
the
induction
spark
but
they
are
more
complicated
and
expensive
and
have
not
entered
into
practical
use
before
commencing
to
describe
these
apparatus
we
shall
make
a
remark
in
regard
to
the
piles
for
working
them
and
that
is
that
we
prefer
for
this
purpose
leclanché
elements
with
agglomerated
plates
and
a
large
surface
of
zinc
in
order
to
bring
about
combustion
in
any
given
substance
it
is
necessary
to
bring
near
it
an
incandescent
body
raised
to
a
certain
temperature
which
varies
with
the
nature
of
the
said
substance
and
which
is
quite
low
for
illuminating
gas
higher
for
petroleum
and
a
white
heat
for
a
wax
taper
or
a
candle
we
have
said
that
we
make
use
exclusively
of
a
platinum
wire
raised
momentarily
to
incandescence
by
the
passage
of
an
electric
current
the
temperature
of
such
wire
will
depend
especially
upon
the
intensity
of
the
current
traversing
it
and
if
this
is
too
great
the
platinum
chosen
because
of
its
inoxidizability
and
its
elevated
melting
point
will
rapidly
melt
while
if
the
intensity
is
too
little
the
temperature
reached
by
the
wire
will
itself
be
too
low
and
no
inflammation
will
be
brought
about
practice
soon
indicates
a
means
of
obviating
these
two
inconveniences
and
teaches
how
each
apparatus
may
be
placed
under
such
conditions
that
the
wire
will
hardly
ever
melt
and
that
the
lighting
will
always
be
effected
for
the
same
intensity
of
current
that
traverses
the
wire
the
temperature
of
the
latter
might
be
made
to
vary
by
diminishing
or
increasing
its
diameter
a
very
fine
wire
will
attain
a
red
heat
through
a
very
weak
current
but
it
would
be
very
brittle
and
subject
to
break
at
the
least
accident
for
this
reason
it
becomes
necessary
to
employ
wires
a
little
stronger
and
varying
generally
from
one
to
of
a
millimeter
in
diameter
the
current
then
requires
to
be
a
little
intenser
the
requisite
intensity
is
easily
obtained
with
elements
of
large
surface
which
have
a
much
feebler
internal
resistance
than
elements
and
since
for
a
given
number
of
elements
the
intensity
of
the
current
decreases
in
measure
as
the
internal
resistance
of
the
elements
increases
it
becomes
of
interest
to
diminish
such
internal
resistance
as
much
as
possible
the
platinum
wires
are
usually
rolled
spirally
with
the
object
in
view
of
concentrating
the
heat
into
a
small
space
in
order
to
raise
the
temperature
of
the
wire
as
much
as
possible
there
is
thus
need
of
a
less
intense
current
to
produce
the
inflammation
than
with
a
wire
simply
stretched
out
in
fact
the
same
wire
traversed
by
a
current
of
constant
intensity
scarcely
reaches
a
heat
when
it
is
straight
while
it
attains
a
heat
when
it
is
wound
spirally
because
in
the
latter
case
the
cooling
surface
is
less

we
shall
now
proceed
to
the
examination
of
a
few
practical
forms
of
electric
lighters
in
fig
will
be
seen
quite
a
convenient
spirit
or
naphtha
lighter
which
has
been
devised
more
especially
for
the
use
of
smokers
by
pushing
the
lamp
toward
the
wall
the
wick
is
brought
into
proximity
with
the
spiral
and
the
lamp
acting
on
a
button
behind
it
closes
the
current
pressure
on
the
lamp
being
removed
the
latter
moves
back
slightly
through
the
pressure
of
a
small
spring
which
thrusts
on
the
button
owing
to
this
latter
simple
arrangement
the
spiral
never
comes
in
contact
with
the
flame
and
may
thus
last
for
a
long
time
loiseau
the
proprietor
of
this
apparatus
employs
a
very
fine
platinum
wire
flattened
into
the
form
of
a
ribbon
and
it
takes
only
the
current
from
a
to
effect
the
inflammation
of
the
wick
the
system
is
so
arranged
that
any
one
can
easily
replace
in
a
moment
the
spiral
that
has
accidentally
got
out
of
order
and
in
order
that
this
may
be
done
the
maker
has
placed
the
spiral
on
a
small
distinct
piece
that
he
styles
the
conflagrator
the
latter
consists
of
two
small
thin
tubes
of
brass
held
parallel
and
firmly
by
means
of
a
brass
a
small
bit
of
paper
wound
round
each
tube
in
front
of
the
insures
insulation
the
outer
extremity
of
the
two
tubes
supports
the
platinum
spiral
which
is
fixed
to
them
very
simply
by
the
aid
of
two
small
brass
needles
of
conical
form
which
pinch
the
wire
in
the
tube
and
hold
it
in
place
there
is
nothing
easier
to
do
than
replace
the
wire
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
remove
the
two
little
rods
with
a
pair
of
pincers
to
make
a
spiral
of
suitable
length
by
rolling
the
wire
round
a
pin
and
to
fix
it
into
the
tubes
as
we
have
just
explained
with
two
or
three
extra
conflagrators
on
hand
there
need
never
any
trouble
occur
in
fig
we
show
a
new
and
simple
form
of
ranque
lighter
in
which
an
concealed
in
the
base
brings
the
spiral
and
the
wick
into
juxtaposition
the
extinguisher
which
is
balanced
by
a
counterpoise
oscillates
about
a
horizontal
axis
and
its
support
carries
two
small
pins
against
which
act
successively
two
notches
in
a
piece
of
oval
form
fixed
on
the
side
of
the
movable
rods
in
the
position
shown
in
the
cut
on
the
first
emission
of
a
current
the
upper
notch
acts
so
as
to
depress
the
extinguisher
but
the
travel
of
the
rods
that
carry
the
spiral
is
so
limited
that
the
latter
does
not
strike
against
the
extinguisher
on
the
next
emission
the
lower
notch
acts
so
as
to
raise
the
extinguisher
while
the
spiral
approaches
the
wick
and
lights
it
it
is
well
to
actuate
these
which
may
be
located
at
a
distance
not
by
a
contact
button
but
by
some
pulling
arrangement
which
is
always
much
more
easy
to
find
in
the
dark
without
much
groping
about
there
might
be
used
for
such
a
purpose
the
very
motion
of
the
front
door
when
opened
for
lighting
the
hall
but
that
would
offer
the
inconvenience
of
operating
likewise
in
the
daytime
and
of
thus
needlessly
using
up
the
pile
and
the
naphtha
in
all
these
spirit
or
naphtha
lighters
it
is
important
that
the
spiral
not
the
wick
but
that
it
shall
be
placed
a
little
above
and
on
the
side
in
the
mixture
of
air
and
combustible
vapor
several
apparatus
have
likewise
been
devised
for
lighting
gas
by
electricity
and
a
few
of
these
we
shall
describe
the
simplest
form
of
these
is
barbier
lighter
for
the
use
of
smokers
for
lighting
candles
sealing
letters
etc
it
consists
of
a
small
affixed
to
a
round
box
seven
to
eight
centimeters
in
diameter
and
connected
to
the
by
a
rubber
tube
by
maneuvering
the
handle
the
cock
is
opened
and
an
electric
contact
set
up
of
sufficient
duration
to
raise
to
a
red
heat
the
spiral
and
to
light
the
gas
it
is
well
in
this
case
for
the
sake
of
economizing
in
wire
to
utilize
the
lead
as
a
return
wire
especially
if
the
pile
is
located
at
some
little
distance
from
the
lighter
in
the
arrangement
generally
in
use
the
key
is
provided
with
a
special
spring
which
tends
to
cause
it
to
turn
in
such
a
way
as
to
assume
a
vertical
position
and
with
a
tooth
which
on
engaging
with
a
piece
moving
on
a
joint
holds
it
in
a
horizontal
position
as
soon
as
it
has
been
brought
thereto
in
order
to
extinguish
the
burner
it
is
only
necessary
to
depress
the
lever
and
thus
allow
the
key
to
assume
again
the
vertical
position
that
is
to
say
the
position
that
closes
the
aperture
through
which
the
gas
flows
out
in
a
new
arrangement
the
notch
spring
and
the
lever
are
done
away
with
the
cock
alone
taking
the
two
positions
open
or
closed
another
very
ingenious
system
is
that
of
loiseau
consisting
of
an
ordinary
etc
carrying
at
its
side
a
conflagrator
analogous
to
that
of
the
fig
but
arranged
vertically
one
of
the
rods
of
the
conflagrator
is
connected
with
the
positive
of
the
pile
and
the
other
with
the
little
horizontal
brass
rod
which
is
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
burner
on
turning
the
cock
so
as
to
open
it
a
small
flow
of
gas
occurs
opposite
the
platinum
spiral
while
at
the
same
time
a
rigid
projecting
piece
affixed
to
the
cock
bears
against
a
small
vertical
metallic
piece
and
brings
it
in
contact
with
the
brass
rod
the
circuit
is
thus
closed
for
an
instant
the
spiral
is
raised
to
a
red
heat
and
lights
the
gas
and
the
flame
rises
and
finally
lights
the
burner
it
goes
without
saying
that
on
continuing
the
motion
the
contact
is
broken
so
as
not
uselessly
to
waste
the
pile
and
so
as
to
stop
the
escape
of
gas
for
gas
furnaces
loiseau
is
constructing
a
which
is
connected
with
the
side
of
the
furnace
by
flexible
cords
the
contact
button
is
on
the
sleeve
itself
and
the
spiral
is
protected
against
shocks
by
a
metallic
covering
which
is
cleft
at
the
extremity
and
the
points
bent
over
at
a
right
angle
all
the
lighters
here
described
work
well
and
are
rendering
valuable
services
they
may
be
considered
as
the
natural
and
indispensable
auxiliaries
of
electric

their
use

most
certainly

rendered

vibration
of

utilized
in
previous
systems
in
which
an

the
sonorous
vibrations
are
due
either
to
the
motion
of

such
a
manner
that
the

of
either
one

of
both
its

is
communicated
to
a

the

also
employ
two
or
more
in

and
utilize
the
vibration
of
both

in
the
manner

can
be
made

through
one
of
these
brushes
and
making
its
exit
through
the
other
will
always
traverse
bobbins
everything
will
occur
then
as
if
we
caused
the
solenoid
to
move
instead
of
the
brushes
this
granted
and
the
brushes
being
in
any
position
whatever
let
us
send
a
current
into
the
apparatus
and
place
therein
a
soft
iron
cylinder
by
virtue
of
a
well
known
law
such
cylinder
will
remain
suspended
in
the
interior
of
the
solenoid
and
its
longitudinal
center
will
place
itself
at
so
much
the
greater
distance
from
that
of
the
solenoid
the
more
the
current
increases
in
intensity
it
would
even
fall
entirely
if
the
current
had
not
an
intensity
above
a
minimum
value
dependent
upon
many
elements
concerning
which
we
have
not
now
to
occupy
ourselves
we
will
suppose
the
current
intense
enough
to
keep
the
distance
of
the
two
centers
much
below
that
which
would
bring
about
a
fall
of
the
cylinder
when
such
a
condition
is
fulfilled
it
is
found
that
if
we
try
to
remove
the
iron
cylinder
from
the
equilibrium
that
it
is
in
we
must
apply
a
pressure
that
increases
with
the
amount
of
separation
just
exactly
as
if
it
were
suspended
from
a
spring
it
results
from
this
fact
that
if
we
displace
the
brushes
a
distance
equal
to
the
thickness
of
one
plate
of
the
collector
the
active
solenoid
will
undergo
the
same
displacement
and
its
longitudinal
center
will
move
away
from
that
of
the
iron
cylinder
and
that
the
attraction
exerted
upon
the
latter
will
increase
it
will
not
be
able
to
assume
its
first
value
and
equilibrium
can
not
be
unless
the
cylinder
undergoes
a
displacement
identical
with
that
of
the
solenoid
now
as
this
latter
depends
upon
the
motion
communicated
to
the
system
of
brushes
we
see
that
definitively
the
cylinder
will
faithfully
reproduce
the
motion
communicated
to
the
brushes
by
the
hand
of
the
operator
this
apparatus
then
constitutes
a
genuine
electric
in
which
the
current
is
never
interrupted
nor
modified
in
quantity
or
direction
no
more
indeed
than
the
magnetization
developed
in
the
soft
iron
cylinder
everything
takes
place
as
if
the
iron
cylinder
were
suspended
in
a
solenoid
ten
centimeters
in
length
that
was
caused
to
rise
and
fall
with
the
difference
that
the
weight
of
the
cylinder
exerts
no
action
on

of

these
explanations
being
understood
there
remain
but
few
things
to
be
said
to
cause
the
operation
of

to
be
thoroughly
comprehended
the
elementary
sections
constituting
the

a

of
the

are
in

they

with

so
that
by

there
maybe
given

most
suitable

when
such
angle
has
been
determined
the
angle

an
alternating

motion
the
iron
cylinder
weighs
kilogrammes
but
when
the
current
has
an
intensity
of
amperes
and
traverses
sections
the
stress
developed
may
reach
kilogrammes
that
is
to
say
three
times
the
weight
of
the
hammer
so
this
latter
obeys
with
absolute
docility
the
motions
of
the
operator
hands
as
those
who
were
present
at
the
lecture
were
enabled
to
see
i
will
incidentally
add
that
this
power
hammer
was
placed
on
a
circuit
derived
from
one
that
served
likewise
to
supply
three
machines
siemens
d
model
and
a
gramme
machine
breguet
model
each
of
these
machines
was
making
revolutions
per
minute
and
developing
kilogrammeters
per
second
measured
by
means
of
a
carpentier
brake
all
these
apparatus
were
operating
with
absolute
independence
and
had
for
generator
the
double
excitation
machine
that
figured
at
the
exhibition
of
electricity
in
an
experiment
made
since
then
i
have
succeeded
in
developing
in
each
of
these
four
machines
kilogrammeters
per
second
whatever
was
the
number
of
those
that
were
running
and
i
found
it
possible
to
add
the
hammer
on
a
derived
circuit
without
notably
affecting
the
operation
of
the
receivers
it
results
from
this
that
with
my
system
of
double
excitation
machine
i
have
been
enabled
to
easily
run
with
absolute
independence
six
machines
each
giving
a
the
economic
performance
moreover
slightly
exceeded

new
electric
lamp
when
it
becomes
a
question
of
practical
lighting
it
is
very
certain
that
the
best
electric
lamp
will
be
the
one
that
is
most
simple
and
requires
the
fewest
mechanical
parts
it
is
to
such
simplicity
that
is
due
all
the
success
of
the
jablochkoff
candle
and
the
lamp
yet
in
the
former
of
these
lamps
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
somewhat
great
and
variable
resistance
opposed
to
the
current
in
its
passage
through
two
carbons
that
keep
diminishing
in
length
in
measure
as
they
burn
proves
a
cause
of
loss
of
light
and
of
variation
in
it
and
it
is
also
to
be
regretted
that
the
duration
of
combustion
of
the
carbons
is
not
longer
and
finally
it
is
allowable
to
believe
that
the
power
employed
in
volatilizing
the
insulator
placed
between
the
carbons
is
prejudicial
to
the
economical
use
of
this
system
in
order
to
obviate
this
latter
inconvenience
an
endeavor
has
been
made
in
the
wilde
candle
to
do
away
with
the
insulator
but
the
results
obtained
have
scarcely
been
encouraging
an
endeavor
has
also
been
made
to
render
the
duration
of
the
carbons
greater
by
employing
quite
long
ones
and
causing
these
to
move
forward
successively
through
the
intermedium
of
a
species
of
rollers
or
of
counterpoises
as
in
the
lamps
of
mersanne
and
werdermann
but
then
the
system
becomes
more
complicated
finally
in
order
to
keep
the
resistance
of
the
carbons
at
a
minimum
and
constant
their
contact
with
the
rheophores
of
the
circuit
has
been
established
at
a
short
distance
from
the
arc
and
this
is
one
of
the
principal
advantages
possessed
by
the
system
at
a
certain
epoch
it
was
thought
that
the
problem
might
be
simply
solved
by
arranging
in
front
of
each
other
two
carbons
actuated
by
a
spiral
spring
as
in
car
lamps
and
kept
at
a
proper
distance
apart
for
forming
the
electric
arc
by
two
pieces
of
calcined
magnesia
into
which
they
entered
like
a
wedge
in
measure
as
their
conical
point
were
away
through
combustion
this
was
the
system
of
de
baillehache
and
the
trials
that
were
made
therewith
were
very
satisfactory
but
unfortunately
the
magnesia
was
not
able
to
resist
very
long
the
temperature
to
which
it
was
submitted
the
problem
found
a
better
solution
in
the
but
has
been
solved
in
another
manner
and
just
as
simply
by
solignac
and
the
results
obtained
by
him
have
been
very
satisfactory
as
regarded
from
the
standpoint
of
steadiness

the

by

so
much
the
greater

becomes
sufficient

that

allow

prevent
any
further
softening

is
perceived
no

the

influence

the
effect
produced

not
under

of
an
action

a
different
nature

happens
in

regulators
it
is
certain
that
this
idea
is
new

original

the
results

was
demonstrated
twenty
years
thereafter
by

by
eliminating

the

was
rewarded
by

at
first
manufactured
from

announced
to
the
scientific
world
that
it
could
be
obtained
from
a
material
called

in
greenland
in
large
quantities
imported
into

under
the

of
mineral
soda
and
used
as
a
washing
soda
and
in
the
manufacture
of

it
consists
of
a
double

and
only
requires
to
be
mixed
with
an

what

the

peat

asphalt
petroleum
are
properly
speaking
not
minerals
at
all
as
they
are
organic
substances
and
have
no
definite
chemical
composition
or
crystalline
forms
they
are
in
fact
chiefly
the
products
or
phases
of
a
progressive
and
inevitable
change
in
which
like
all
organic
matter
is
an
unstable
compound
and
destined
to
decomposition
in
virtue
of
a
mysterious
and
inscrutable
force
which
resides
in
the
microscopic
embryo
of
the

a
tree
begins
its
growth
for
a
brief
interval
this
growth
is
maintained
by
the
prepared
food
stored
in
the
cotyledons
and
this
suffices
to
produce
and
to
bring
into

the

life
goes
on

in

and
dormant
in

absorbing
the

as
a

which
it
controls

are

of
the

the

during
all
the
years
of
the

of
the

these
organs
are
mainly
occupied
in
breaking

that
unite

off

hundreds
of

in

in
opposition
to
the
force
of

and
to
the
affinities
of
inorganic
chemistry
the
time
comes
however
sooner
or
later
when
the
power
which
has
created
and
the
life
that
has
pervaded
this
wonderful
structure
abandon
it
the
affinities
of
inorganic
chemistry
immediately
reassert
themselves
in
ordinary
circumstances
rapidly
tearing
down
the
ephemeral
fabric
the
disintegration
of
organic

when
deserted
by
the

to
the
phenomena
which
form
the
theme
of
this
paper
most
decomposes
with
great
rapidity
and
plant
tissue
when
not
protected
soon
decays
this
decay
is
essentially
oxidation
since
its
final
result
is
the
restoration
to
the
atmosphere
of
carbonic
acid
which
is
broken
up
in
by
the
appropriation
of
its
carbon
hence
it
is
a
kind
of
combustion
although
this
term
is
more
generally
applied
to
very
rapid
oxidation
with
the
evolution
of
sensible
light
and
heat
but
whether
the
process
goes
on
rapidly
or
slowly
the
same
force
is
evolved
that
is
absorbed
in
the
growth
of
and
by
accelerating
and
guiding
its
evolution
we
are
able
to
utilize
this
force
in
the
production
at

of
heat

and
their
correlatives
chemical
affinity
motive
power
electricity
and

the
decomposition
of
plants
may
however
be
more
or
less
retarded
and
it
then
takes
the
form
of
a
destructive
distillation
the
constituents
reacting
upon
each
other
and
forming
temporary
combinations
part
of
which
are
evolved
and
part
remain
behind
water
is
the
great
extinguisher
of
this
as
of
the
more
rapid
oxidation
that
we
call
combustion
and
the
decomposition
of
under
water
is
extremely
slow
from
the
partial
exclusion
of
oxygen
buried
under
thick
and
nearly
impervious
masses
of
clay
where
the
exclusion
of
oxygen
is
still
more
nearly
complete
the
decomposition
is
so
far
retarded
that
which
is
destroyed
by
combustion
almost
instantaneously
and
if
exposed
to
the
elements
moisture
with
a
free
access
of
oxygen
decays
in
a
year
or
two
may
be
but
partially
consumed
when
millions
of
years
have
passed
the
final
result
is
however
inevitable
and
always
the
same
the
oxidation
and
escape
of
the
organic
mutter
and
the
concentration
of
the
inorganic
matter
woven
into
its
composition
in
it
but
not
of
it
forming
what
we
call
the
ash
of
the
plant
since
the
decomposition
of
organic
matter
commences
the
instant
it
is
abandoned
by
the
creative
and
conservative
vital
force
and
proceeds
uninterruptedly
whether
slowly
or
rapidly
to
the
final
result
it
is
evident
that
each
moment
in
the
progress
of
this
decomposition
presents
us
with
a
phase
of
structure
and
composition
different
from
that
which
preceded
and
from
that
which
follows
it
hence
the
succession
of
these
phases
forms
a
complete
sliding
scale
which
is
graphically
shown
in
the

where
the

of

we
may

this

of

products
where
we
please
and
by
careful
analysis
determine
accurately
the
chemical
composition
of
a
section
at
this
point
and
we
may
please
ourselves
with
the
illusion
as
many
chemists
have
done
that
the
definite
proportions
found
represent
the
formula
of
a
specific
compound
but
an
adjacent
section
above
or
below
would
show
a
different
composition
and
so
in
the
entire
triangle
we
should
find
an
infinite
series
of
formulae
or
rather
no
constant
formulae
at
all
we
should
also
find
that
the
slice
taken
at
any
point
while
lying
in
the
laboratory
or
undergoing
chemical
treatment
would
change
in
composition
and
become
a
different
substance
in
the
same
way
we
can
snatch
a
brand
from
the
fire
at
any
stage
of
its
decomposition
or
analyze
a
decaying
tree
trunk
during
any
month
of
its
existence
and
thus
manufacture
as
many
chemical
formulae
as
we
like
and
give
them
specific
names
but
it
is
evident
that
this
is
play
not
science
the
truth
is
the
slowly
decomposing
tissue
of
the
plants
of
past
ages
has
given
us
a
series
of
phases
which
we
have
grouped
under
distinct
names
and
we
have
called
one
group
peat
one
lignite
another
coal
another
anthracite
and
another
graphite
we
have
spaced
off
the
scale
and
called
all
within
certain
lines
by
a
common
name
but
this
does
not
give
us
a
common
composition
for
all
the
material
within
these
lines
hence
we
see
that
any
effort
to
define
or
describe
coal
lignite
or
anthracite
accurately
must
be
a
failure
because
neither
has
a
fixed
composition
neither
is
a
distinct
substance
but
simply
a
conventional
group
of
substances
which
form
part
of
an
infinite
and
indivisible
series
but
this
sliding
scale
of
solid
compounds
which
we
designate
by
the
names
given
above
is
not
the
only
product
of
the
natural
and
spontaneous
distillation
of
plant
tissue
part
of
the
original
organic
mass
remains
though
constantly
wasting
to
represent
it
another
part
escapes
either
completely
oxidized
as
carbonic
acid
and
water
or
in
a
volatile
or
liquid
form
still
retaining
its
organic
character
and
destined
to
future
oxidation
known
as
carbureted
hydrogen
olefiant
gas
petroleum
etc
hence
in
the
decomposition
of
vegetable
tissue
two
classes
of
resultant
compounds
are
formed
one
residual
and
the
other
evolved
and
the
genesis
and
relation
of

be
accurately
shown

in
this

the
vertical

connecting
the

of
the

and
of
the

of

indicates
that
each
succeeding
one
is
produced
by
further
alteration
from
that
which
precedes
it
and
not
independently
also
the
arrangement
of
the
braces
is
designed
to
show
that
any
or
all
of
the
evolved
products
are
given
off
at
each
stage
of
alteration
the
theory
here
proposed
has
not
been
evolved
from
my
inner
consciousness
but
has
grown
from
careful
study
through
many
years
of
facts
in
the
field
a
brief
sketch
of
the
evidence
in
favor
of
it
is
all
that
we
have
space
for
here
residual
products
dry
consists
of
about
per
cent
of
carbon
per
cent
of
oxygen
with
a
little
nitrogen
and
per
cent
of
hydrogen
in
a
we
find
the
upper
part
of
the
scale
represented
above
very
well
shown
plants
are
growing
on
the
surface
with
the
normal
composition
of
cellulose
the
first
stratum
of
peat
consists
of
browned
and
partially
decomposed
which
is
found
to
have
lost
perhaps
per
cent
of
the
components
of
wood
and
to
have
acquired
an
increasing
percentage
of
carbon
as
we
descend
in
the
peat
it
becomes
more
homogeneous
and
darker
until
at
the
bottom
of
the
marsh
ten
or
twenty
feet
from
the
surface
we
have
a
black
carbonaceous
paste
which
when
dried
resembles
some
varieties
of
coal
and
approaches
them
in
composition
it
has
lost
half
the
substance
of
the
original
plant
and
shows
a
marked
increase
in
the
relative
proportion
of
carbon
each
inch
in
vertical
thickness
of
the
represents
a
phase
in
the
progressive
change
from
to
lignite
using
this
term
with
its
common
signification
to
indicate
not
necessarily
carbonized
ligneous
tissue
but
that
belongs
to
a
past
though
modern
geological
age
tertiary
cretaceous
jurassic
or
triassic
these
lignites
or
modern
coals
are
only
peat
beds
which
have
been
buried
for
a
longer
or
shorter
time
under
clay
sand
or
solidified
rock
and
have
progressed
farther
or
less
far
on
the
road
to
coal
as
with
peats
so
with
lignites
we
find
that
at
different
geological
levels
they
exhibit
different
stages
of
this
distillation
the
tertiary
lignites
being
usually
distinguished
without
difficulty
by
the
presence
of
a
larger
quantity
of
combined
water
and
oxygen
and
a
less
quantity
of
carbon
than
the
cretaceous
coals
and
these
in
turn
differ
in
the
same
respects
from
the
triassic
all
the
coals
of
the
tertiary
and
mesozoic
ages
are
grouped
under
one
name
but
it
is
evident
that
they
are
as
different
from
each
other
as
the
new
and
spongy
from
the
old
and
peat
in
the
by
mere
convention
we
call
the
peat
which
accumulated
in
the
carboniferous
age
by
the
name
of
bituminous
coal
and
an
examination
of
the
carboniferous
strata
in
different
countries
has
shown
that
the
formed
in
the
carboniferous
age
though
varying
somewhat
like
others
with
the
kind
of
vegetation
from
which
they
were
derived
have
a
common
character
by
which
they
may
be
distinguished
from
the
more
modern
coals
containing
less
water
less
oxygen
and
more
carbon
and
usually
exhibiting
the
property
of
coking
which
is
rare
in
coals
of
later
date
though
there
is
great
diversity
in
the
carboniferous
coals
and
it
would
be
absurd
to
express
their
composition
by
a
single
formula
it
may
be
said
that
over
the
whole
world
these
coals
have
characteristics
as
a
group
by
which
they
can
be
recognized
the
result
of
the
slow
decomposition
of
the
tissue
of
plants
which
lived
in
the
carboniferous
age
and
which
have
by
a
broad
and
general
change
approximated
to
a
certain
phase
in
the
spontaneous
distillation
of
an
experienced
geologist
will
not
fail
to
refer
to
their
proper
horizon
a
group
of
coals
of
carboniferous
age
any
more
than
those
of
the
cretaceous
or
tertiary
in
the
ages
anterior
to
the
carboniferous
the
quantity
of
land
vegetation
was
apparently
not
sufficient
to
form
thick
and
extensive
beds
of
peat
but
the
remains
of
are
contained
in
all
the
older
formations
though
there
only
as
anthracite
or
graphite
the
last
two
groups
of
residual
products
of
these
we
have
examples
in
the
beds
of
graphite
in
the
laurentian
rocks
of
canada
and
of
anthracite
of
the
lower
silurian
strata
of
upper
church
and
kilnaleck
ireland
from
these
facts
it
is
apparent
that
the
carbon
series
is
graded
geologically
that
is
by
the
lapse
of
time
during
which
has
been
subjected
to
this
natural
and
spontaneous
distillation
but
we
have
better
evidence
than
this
of
the
derivation
of
one
from
another
of
the
groups
of
residual
products
which
have
been
enumerated
in
many
localities
the
coals
and
lignites
of
different
ages
have
been
exposed
to
local
influences
such
as
the
outbursts
of
or
the
metamorphism
of
mountain
chains
which
have
hastened
the
distillation
and
out
of
known
earlier
groups
have
produced
the
last
for
example
trap
outbursts
have
converted
tertiary
lignites
in
alaska
into
good
bituminous

on

in

colorado
and
at
the
placer

near
santa
fe
new
mexico
cretaceous
lignites
into
anthracite
those
from
queen
charlotte
island
and
southwestern
colorado
are
as
bright
hard
and
valuable
as
any
from
pennsylvania
at
a
little
distance
from
the
focus
of
volcanic
action
the
cretaceous
coals
of
southwestern
colorado
have
been
made
bituminous
and
coking
while
at
the
placer
mountains
the
same
stratum
may
be
seen
in
its
anthracitic
and
lignitic
stages
a
still
better
series
illustrating
the
derivation
of
one
form
of
carbon
solids
from
another
is
furnished
by
the
coals
of
ohio
pennsylvania
and
rhode
island
these
are
of
the
same
age
in
ohio
presenting
the
normal
composition
and
physical
characters
of
bituminous
coals
that
is
of
plant
tissue
generally
and
uniformly
descending
the
scale
in
the
lapse
of
time
from
the
carboniferous
age
to
the
present
in
the
mountains
of
pennsylvania
the
same
coal
beds
somewhat
affected
by
the
metamorphism
which
all
the
rocks
of
the
alleghanies
have
shared
have
reached
the
stage
of
coals
where
half
the
volatile
constituents
have
been
driven
off
again
in
the
anthracite
basins
of
eastern
pennsylvania
the
distillation
further
effected
has
formed
from
these
coals
containing
only
from
three
to
ten
per
cent
of
volatile
matter
while
in
the
focus
of
metamorphic
action
at
newport
rhode
island
the
carboniferous
coals
have
been
changed
to
that
is
are
half
anthracite
and
half
graphite
here
traveling
from
west
to
east
a
progressive
change
is
noted
similar
to
that
which
may
be
observed
in
making
a
vertical
section
of
a
peat
bog
or
in
comparing
the
coals
of
tertiary
mesozoic
and
carboniferous
age
only
the
latter
is
the
continuation
and
natural
sequence
of
the
former
series
of
changes
in
the
laurentian
rocks
of
canada
are
large
accumulations
of
carbonaceous
matter
all
of
which
is
graphite
and
that
which
is
universally
conceded
to
be
derived
from
the
oxidation
of
graphite
is
artificially
difficult
and
in
nature
laboratory
slow
but
it
is
inevitable
as
we
see
in
the
decomposition
of
its
outcrops
and
the
blanching
of
exposed
surfaces
of
clouded
marbles
where
the
coloring
is
graphite
thus
the
end
is
reached
and
by
observations
in
the
field
the
origin
and
relationship
of
the
different
carbon
solids
derived
from
organic
tissue
are
demonstrated
it
only
remains
to
be
said
in
regard
to
them
that
all
the
changes
enumerated
may
be
imitated
artificially
and
that
the
stages
of
decomposition
which
we
have
designated
by
the
names
graphite
anthracite
coal
lignite
are
not
necessary
results
of
the
decomposition
of
a
fallen
tree
may
slowly
consume
away
and
all
its
carbonaceous
matter
may
be
oxidized
and
dissipated
without
exhibiting
the
phases
of
lignite
coal
etc
and
lignite
and
coal
when
exposed
to
air
and
moisture
are
burned
away
to
ashes
in
the
same
manner
simply
because
in
these
cases
complete
oxidation
of
the
carbon
takes
place
particle
by
particle
and
the
mass
is
not
affected
as
a
whole
in
such
a
way
as
to
assume
the
intermediate
stages
referred
to
chemical
analysis
however
proves
that
the
process
is
essentially
the
same
although
the
physical
results
are
different
evolved
products
the
gradual
wasting
of
in
the
formation
of
peat
lignite
coal
may
be
estimated
as
averaging
for
peat
to
per
cent
lignite
to
per
cent
coal
to
per
cent
anthracite
to
and
graphite
per
cent
of
the
original
mass
the
evolved
products
ultimately
represent
the
entire
organic
portion
of
the
wood
the
mineral
matter
or
ash
being
the
only
residuum
these
evolved
products
include
both
liquids
and
gases
and
by
subsequent
changes
solids
are
produced
from
some
of
them
carbonic
acid
carbonic
oxide
nitrogenous
and
hydrocarbon
gases
water
and
petroleum
are
mentioned
above
as
the
substances
which
escape
from
during
its
decomposition
that
all
these
are
eliminated
in
the
decay
of
vegetable
and
animal
structures
is
now
generally
conceded
by
chemists
and
geologists
although
there
is
a
wide
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
nature
of
the
process
it
has
been
claimed
that
the
evolved
products
enumerated
above
are
the
results
of
the
primary
decomposition
of
organic
matter
and
never
of
further
changes
in
the
residual
products
that
in
the
of
organic
tissue
variable
quantities
of
coal
anthracite
petroleum
marsh
gas
are
formed
but
that
these
are
never
derived
the
one
from
the
other
this
opinion
is
however
certainly
erroneous
and
the
formation
of
any
or
all
the
evolved
products
may
take
place
throughout
the
entire
progress
of
the
decomposition
marsh
gas
and
carbonic
acid
are
seen
escaping
from
the
surface
of
pools
where
recent
vegetable
matter
is
submerged
and
they
are
also
eliminated
in
the
further
decomposition
of
peat
lignite
coal
and
carbonaceous
shale
fire
damp
and
common
names
for
the
gases
mentioned
above
are
produced
in
large
quantities
in
the
mines
where
tertiary
or
cretaceous
lignites
or
carboniferous
coals
or
anthracites
are
mined
it
has
been
said
that
these
gases
are
simply
locked
up
in
the
interstices
of
the
carbonaceous
matter
and
are
liberated
in
its
excavation
but
all
who
have
worked
coal
mines
know
that
such
accumulations
are
not
sufficient
to
supply
the
enormous
and
continuous
flow
which
comes
from
all
parts
of
the
mass
penetrated
we
have
ample
proof
moreover
that
coal
when
exposed
to
the
air
undergoes
a
kind
of
distillation
in
which
the
evolution
of
carbonic
acid
and
hydrocarbon
gases
is
a
necessary
and
prominent
feature
the
gas
makers
know
that
if
their
coal
is
permitted
to
lie
for
months
or
years
after
being
mined
it
suffers
serious
deterioration
yielding
a
less
and
less
quantity
of
illuminating
gas
with
the
lapse
of
time
so
coking
coals
are
rendered
dry
and
valueless
for
this
purpose
by
long
exposure
carbureted
hydrogen
olefiant
gas
are
constant
associates
of
the
petroleum
of
springs
or
wells
and
this
escape
of
gas
and
oil
has
been
going
on
in
some
localities
without
apparent
diminution
for
two
or
three
thousand
years
we
can
only
account
for
the
persistence
of
this
flow
by
supposing
that
it
is
maintained
by
the
gradual
distillation
of
the
carbonaceous
masses
with
which
such
evolutions
of
gas
or
of
liquid
are
always
connected
if
it
were
true
that
carbureted
hydrogen
and
petroleum
are
produced
only
from
the
primary
decomposition
of
organic
tissue
it
would
be
inevitable
that
at
least
the
elastic
gases
would
have
escaped
long
since
oil
wells
which
have
been
nominally
exhausted
that
is
from
which
the
accumulations
of
centuries
in
rock
reservoirs
have
been
pumped
and
therefore
have
been
abandoned
have
in
all
cases
been
found
to
be
slowly
replenished
by
a
current
and
constant
secretion
apparently
the
product
of
an
unceasing
distillation
in
the
valley
of
the
cumberland
about
burkesville
one
of
the
oil
regions
of
the
country
the
gases
escaping
from
the
equivalent
of
the
utica
shale
accumulate
under
the
plates
of
impervious
limestone
above
until
masses
of
rock
and
earth
hundreds
of
tons
in
weight
are
sometimes
thrown
out
with
great
violence
unless
these
gases
had
been
produced
by
comparatively
recent
distillation
such
explosions
could
not
occur
in
opening
a
coal
mine
on
a
hillside
the
first
traces
of
the
coal
seam
are
found
in
a
dark
stain
in
the
superficial
clay
then
a
substance
like
rotten
wood
is
reached
from
which
all
the
volatile
constituents
have
escaped
these
appear
however
later
and
continue
to
increase
as
the
mine
is
deepened
until
under
water
or
a
heavy
covering
of
rock
the
coal
attains
its
normal
physical
and
chemical
characters
here
it
is
evident
that
the
coal
has
undergone
a
distillation
which
must
have
resulted
in
the
constant
production
of
carbonic
acid
and
carbureted
hydrogen
a
line
of
perennial
oil
and
gas
springs
marks
the
outcrop
of
every
great
stratum
of
carbonaceous
matter
in
the
country
of
these
the
most
considerable
and
remarkable
are
the
bituminous
shales
of
the
silurian
utica
shale
of
the
devonian
hamilton
and
huron
shales
the
carboniferous
etc
here
the
carbonaceous
constituent
to
per
cent
is
disseminated
through
a
great
proportion
of
inorganic
material
clay
and
sand
and
seems
both
from
the
nature
of
the
materials
which
furnished
it
cellular
plants
and
minute
animal
organisms
and
its
dissemination
to
be
specially
prone
to
spontaneous
distillation
the
utica
shale
is
the
lowest
of
these
great
sheets
of
carbonaceous
matter
and
that
supplies
the
gases
and
liquids
which
issue
from
the
earth
at
collingwood
canada
and
in
the
valley
of
the
cumberland
the
next
carbonaceous
sheet
is
formed
by
the
great
bituminous
shale
beds
of
the
upper
devonian
which
underlie
and
supply
the
oil
wells
in
western
pennsylvania
in
some
places
the
shale
is
several
hundred
feet
in
thickness
and
contains
more
carbonaceous
matter
than
all
the
overlying
coal
strata
the
outcrop
of
this
formation
from
central
new
york
to
tennessee
is
conspicuously
marked
by
gas
springs
the
flow
from
which
is
apparently
unfailing
petroleum
is
scarcely
less
constant
in
its
connection
with
these
carbonaceous
rocks
than
carbureted
hydrogen
and
it
only
escapes
notice
from
the
little
space
it
occupies
the
two
substances
are
so
closely
allied
that
they
must
have
a
common
origin
and
they
are
in
fact
generated
simultaneously
in
thousands
of
localities
during
the
oil
excitement
of
some
years
since
when
the
whole
country
was
hunted
over
for
oil
sign
in
many
lagoons
from
which
bubbles
of
were
constantly
escaping
films
of
genuine
petroleum
were
found
on
the
surface
and
as
the
underlying
strata
were
barren
of
oil
this
could
only
have
been
derived
from
the
decaying
vegetable
tissue
below
in
the
bay
of
marquette
two
or
three
miles
north
of
the
town
where
the
shore
is
a
peat
bog
underlain
by
archæan
rocks
i
have
seen
bubbles
of
carbureted
hydrogen
rising
in
great
numbers
attended
by
drops
of
petroleum
which
spread
as
iridescent
films
on
the
surface
the
remarks
which
have
been
made
in
regard
to
the
heterogeneous
nature
of
the
solid
hydrocarbons
apply
with
scarcely
less
force
to
the
gaseous
and
liquid
products
of
vegetable
decomposition
the
gases
which
escape
from
marshes
contain
carbonic
acid
a
number
of
hydrocarbon
gases
or
the
materials
out
of
which
they
may
be
composed
in
the
process
of
analysis
and
finally
a
larger
or
smaller
volume
of
nitrogenous
gas
it
is
possible
that
the
elimination
of
these
gases
takes
the
form
of
fractional
distillation
and
definite
compounds
may
be
formed
directly
from
the
or
its
derivatives
and
mingle
as
they
escape
this
is
however
not
certain
for
the
gases
as
we
find
them
are
always
mixtures
and
never
pure
in
the
liquid
evolved
products
the
petroleums
this
is
emphatically
true
for
we
combine
under
this
name
fluids
which
vary
greatly
in
both
their
physical
and
chemical
characters
some
are
light
and
ethereal
others
are
thick
and
tarry
some
are
transparent
some
opaque
some
red
some
brown
others
green
some
have
an
offensive
and
others
an
agreeable
odor
some
contain
asphalt
in
large
quantity
others
paraffine
etc
thus
they
form
a
heterogeneous
assemblage
of
liquid
hydrocarbons
of
which
naphtha
and
maltha
may
be
said
to
form
the
extremes
and
which
have
little
in
common
except
their
undefinable
name
the
causes
of
these
differences
are
but
imperfectly
understood
but
we
know
that
they
are
in
part
dependent
on
the
nature
of
the
organic
material
that
has
furnished
the
petroleums
and
in
part
upon
influences
affecting
them
after
their
formation
for
example
the
oil
which
saturates
the
niagara
limestone
at
chicago
and
which
is
undoubtedly
indigenous
in
this
rock
and
probably
of
animal
origin
is
black
and
thick
that
from
enniskillen
canada
is
also
black
has
a
vile
odor
probably
in
virtue
of
sulphur
compounds
and
we
have
reason
to
believe
is
derived
from
animal
matter
the
oils
of
northwestern
pennsylvania
are
mostly
brown
sometimes
green
by
reflected
light
and
have
a
pungent
and
characteristic
odor
these
are
undoubtedly
derived
from
the
hamilton
shales
which
contain
ten
or
twenty
per
cent
of
carbonaceous
matter
apparently
produced
from
the
decomposition
of
since
these
are
in
places
exceedingly
abundant
and
nearly
all
other
fossils
are
absent
the
oils
of
italy
though
varying
much
in
appearance
have
usually
an
ethereal
odor
that
is
rather
agreeable
they
are
of
tertiary
age
the
oils
of
japan
differing
much
among
themselves
have
as
a
common
character
an
odor
quite
different
from
the
pennsylvania
oils
so
the
petroleums
of
the
caspian
of
india
california
occurring
at
different
geological
horizons
exhibit
a
diversity
of
physical
and
chemical
characters
which
may
be
fairly
supposed
to
depend
upon
the
material
from
which
they
have
been
distilled
the
oils
in
the
same
region
however
are
found
to
exhibit
a
series
of
differences
which
are
plainly
the
result
of
causes
operating
upon
them
after
their
production
near
the
surface
they
are
thicker
and
darker
below
and
near
the
carbonaceous
mass
from
which
they
have
been
generated
they
are
of
lighter
gravity
and
color
we
find
in
limited
quantity
oils
which
are
nearly
white
and
may
be
used
in
lamps
without
refining
which
have
been
refined
in
fact
in
nature
laboratory
others
that
are
reddish
yellow
by
transmitted
light
sometimes
green
by
reflected
light
are
called
amber
oils
these
also
occur
in
small
quantity
and
as
i
am
led
to
believe
have
acquired
their
characteristics
by
filtration
through
masses
of
sandstone
whatever
the
variety
of
petroleum
may
be
if
exposed
for
a
long
time
to
the
air
it
undergoes
a
spontaneous
distillation
in
which
gases
and
vapors
existing
or
formed
escape
and
solid
residues
are
left
the
nature
of
these
solids
varies
with
the
petroleums
from
which
they
come
some
producing
asphaltum
others
paraffine
others
ozokerite
and
so
on
through
a
long
list
of
substances
which
have
received
distinct
names
as
mineral
species
though
rarely
if
ever
possessing
a
definite
and
invariable
composition
the
change
of
petroleum
to
asphalt
may
be
witnessed
at
a
great
number
of
localities
in
canada
the
black
asphaltic
oil
forms
by
its
evaporation
great
sheets
of
hard
or
tarry
asphalt
called
gum
beds
around
the
in
the
far
west
are
numerous
springs
of
petroleum
which
are
known
to
the
hunters
as
because
of
the
accumulations
about
them
of
the
products
of
the
evaporation
and
oxidation
of
petroleum
to
tar
or
asphalt
certain
less
common
oils
yield
ozokerite
as
a
solid
and
considerable
accumulations
of
this
are
known
in
galicia
and
utah
natural
paraffine
is
less
abundant
and
yet
in
places
it
occurs
in
considerable
quantity
asphalt
is
the
common
name
for
the
solid
residue
from
the
evaporation
and
oxidation
of
petroleum
and
large
accumulations
of
this
substance
are
known
in
many
parts
of
the
world
perhaps
the
most
noted
of
all
being
that
of
the
pitch
lake
of
the
island
of
trinidad
there
as
everywhere
else
the
derivation
of
asphalt
from
petroleum
is
obvious
and
traceable
in
all
stages
the
asphalts
then
have
a
common
history
in
this
that
they
are
produced
by
the
evaporation
and
oxidation
of
petroleum
but
it
should
also
be
said
that
they
share
the
diversity
of
character
of
petroleums
and
the
term
asphalt
represents
a
group
of
substances
of
which
the
physical
characters
and
chemical
composition
differ
greatly
in
virtue
of
their
derivation
and
also
differ
from
changes
which
they
are
constantly
undergoing
thus
at
the
pitch
lake
in
trinidad
the
central
portion
is
a
tarry
petroleum
near
the
sides
a
plastic
asphalt
and
finally
that
which
is
of
almost
solidity
hence
we
see
that
the
solid
residues
from
petroleum
are
unstable
compounds
like
the
coals
and
lignites
and
in
virtue
of
their
organic
nature
are
constantly
undergoing
a
series
of
changes
of
which
the
final
term
is
combustion
or
oxidation
from
these
facts
we
might
fairly
infer
that
asphalts
formed
in
geological
ages
anterior
to
the
present
would
exhibit
characters
resulting
from
still
further
distillation
that
they
would
be
harder
and
drier
containing
less
volatile
ingredients
and
more
fixed
carbon
such
is
in
fact
the
case
and
these
older
asphalts
are
represented
by
which
i
have
designated
as
asphaltic
coals
these
are
found
in
fissures
and
cavities
in
rocks
of
various
ages
which
have
been
more
or
less
disturbed
and
usually
in
regions
where
springs
of
petroleum
now
exist
the
albertite
fills
fissures
in
carboniferous
rocks
in
new
brunswick
on
a
line
of
disturbance
and
near
precisely
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
grahamite
of
west
virginia
it
fills
a
vertical
fissure
which
was
cut
through
the
sandstones
and
shales
of
the
in
the
sandstones
it
remained
open
in
the
shales
it
has
been
closed
by
the
yielding
of
the
rock
the
grahamite
fills
the
open
fissure
in
the
sandstone
and
was
plainly
introduced
when
in
a
liquid
state
in
the
vicinity
are
oil
springs
and
it
is
on
an
axis
of
disturbance
from
near
tampico
mexico
i
have
received
a
hydrocarbon
solid
essentially
grahamite
asphalt
and
petroleum
these
are
described
as
occurring
near
together
and
evidently
represent
phases
of
different
dates
in
the
same
substance
i
have
collected
asphaltic
coals
very
similar
to
grahamite
and
albertite
in
appearance
and
chemical
composition
in
colorado
and
utah
where
they
occur
with
the
game
associates
as
at
tampico
i
have
found
at
canajoharie
new
york
in
cavities
in
the
which
rut
the
utica
shale
a
hydrocarbon
solid
which
must
have
infiltrated
into
these
cavities
as
petroleum
but
which
since
the
remote
period
when
the
fissures
were
formed
has
been
distilled
until
it
is
now
similar
anthracitic
asphalt
or
asphaltic
anthracite
is
common
in
the
calciferous
in
herkimer
county
new
york
where
it
is
associated
with
and
often
contained
in
the
beautiful
crystals
of
quartz
for
which
the
locality
is
famous
here
the
same
phase
of
distillation
is
reached
as
in
the
coke
residuum
of
the
petroleum
stills
again
in
some
crystalline
limestones
detached
scales
or
crystals
of
occur
which
are
undoubtedly
the
product
of
the
complete
distillation
of
liquid
hydrocarbons
with
which
the
rock
was
once
impregnated
the
remarkable
purity
of
such
graphite
is
the
natural
result
of
its
mode
of
formation
and
such
cases
resemble
the
occurrence
of
graphite
in
cast
iron
and
basalt
the
black
clouds
and
bands
which
stain
many
otherwise
white
marbles
are
generally
due
to
specks
of
graphite
the
residue
of
hydrocarbons
which
once
saturated
the
rock
some
limestones
are
quite
black
from
the
carbonaceous
matter
they
contain
lycoming
valley
glenn
falls
and
collingwood
canada
and
these
are
sold
as
black
marbles
but
if
exposed
to
heat
such
limestones
are
blanched
by
the
expulsion
of
the
contained
carbon
usually
a
residue
of
anthracite
or
graphite
is
left
forming
dark
spots
or
streaks
as
we
find
in
the
clouded
and
banded
marbles
finally
the
great
work
going
on
in
nature
laboratory
may
be
closely
imitated
by
art
the
differences
in
the
results
being
simply
the
consequence
of
differing
conditions
in
the
experiments
vegetable
tissue
has
been
converted
artificially
into
the
equivalents
of
lignite
coal
anthracite
and
graphite
with
the
emission
of
vapors
gases
and
oils
closely
resembling
those
evolved
in
natural
processes
so
petroleum
may
be
distilled
to
form
asphalt
and
this
in
turn
converted
into
albertite
and
coke
anthracite
grahamite
has
been
artificially
produced
from
petroleum
by
jenney
in
the
preceding
remarks
no
effort
has
been
made
even
to
enumerate
all
the
carbon
minerals
which
have
been
described
this
was
unnecessary
in
a
discussion
of
the
relations
of
the
more
important
groups
and
would
have
extended
this
article
much
beyond
its
prescribed
length
those
who
care
to
gain
a
fuller
knowledge
of
the
different
members
of
the
various
groups
are
referred
to
the
admirable
chapter
on
the
hydrocarbon
compounds
in
dana
mineralogy
it
will
however
add
to
the
value
of
this
paper
if
brief
mention
be
made
of
a
few
carbon
minerals
of
which
the
genesis
and
relations
are
not
generally
known
and
in
regard
to
which
special
interest
is
felt
such
as
the
diamond
jet
the
hydrocarbon
jellies
dopplerite
etc
the
diamond
is
found
in
the
of
metamorphic
rocks
in
many
countries
and
is
probably
one
of
the
evolved
products
of
the
distillation
of
organic
matter
they
once
contained
under
peculiar
circumstances
it
has
apparently
been
formed
by
precipitation
from
sulphide
of
carbon
or
some
other
volatile
carbon
compound
by
elective
affinity
laboratory
experiments
have
proved
the
possibility
of
producing
it
by
such
a
process
but
the
artificial
crystals
are
microscopic
perhaps
only
because
a
long
time
is
required
to
build
up
those
of
larger
size
jet
is
a
carbonaceous
solid
which
in
most
cases
is
a
true
lignite
and
generally
retains
more
or
less
of
the
structure
of
wood
masses
are
sometimes
found
that
show
no
structure
and
these
are
probably
formed
from
bitumen
which
has
separated
from
the
wood
of
which
it
once
formed
part
and
which
it
generally
saturates
or
invests
in
some
cases
however
these
masses
of
substance
are
plainly
the
residuum
of
excrementitious
matter
voided
by
fishes
or
reptiles
these
latter
are
often
found
in
the
triassic
of
connecticut
and
new
jersey
and
in
the
cretaceous
marls
of
the
latter
state
the
discovery
of
a
quantity
of
hydrocarbon
jelly
recently
in
a
at
scranton
has
caused
some
wonder
but
similar
substances
dopplerite
etc
have
been
met
with
in
the
of
other
countries
and
while
the
history
of
the
formation
of
this
singular
group
of
hydrocarbons
is
not
yet
well
understood
and
offers
an
interesting
subject
for
future
research
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
these
jellies
have
been
of
common
occurrence
among
the
evolved
products
of
the
decomposition
of
vegetable
tissue
in
all
ages
the
fossil
resins
often
erroneously
called
gums
amber
kauri
copal
though
interestingly
related
to
the
enumerated
on
the
preceding
pages
form
no
essential
part
of
the
series
and
demand
only
the
briefest
notice
here
is
the
resin
which
exuded
from
certain
coniferous
trees
that
in
tertiary
times
grew
abundantly
in
northern
europe
the
leaves
and
trunks
of
these
trees
have
generally
perished
but
masses
of
their
resin
more
enduring
buried
in
the
earth
on
the
shores
of
the
baltic
have
in
the
lapse
of
time
changed
physically
and
chemically
and
have
become
fitted
for
the
ornamental
purposes
for
which
they
have
been
used
by
all
civilized
nations
is
the
resin
of
a
living
coniferous
tree
of
new
zealand
and
the
gum
is
dug
from
the
earth
on
the
sites
of
forests
which
have
now
disappeared
is
a
commercial
name
given
to
the
resins
of
several
different
trees
but
the
most
esteemed
and
indeed
the
only
true
copal
is
the
product
of
a
tree
which
grows
along
the
zanzibar
coast
and
has
left
its
resin
buried
in
the
sands
of
old
raised
beaches
which
it
has
abandoned
the
diversity
of
character
which
the
fossil
resins
exhibit
shows
the
complexity
of
the
vital
processes
in
operation
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
and
gives
probability
to
the
theory
that
some
of
the
differences
we
find
in
the
carbon
minerals
are
due
to
differences
in
the
plants
from
which
they
have
been
derived
the
variations
in
the
physical
and
chemical
characters
of
different
coals
from
the
same
basin
and
from
different
parts
of
the
same
stratum
have
been
sometimes
credited
to
the
same
cause
but
they
are
probably
in
greater
degree
due
to
the
differences
in
the
conditions
under
which
these
varieties
have
been
formed
cannel
coal
as
i
have
shown
elsewhere
jour
march
is
completely
macerated
vegetable
tissue
which
was
deposited
as
carbonaceous
mud
at
the
bottom
of
lagoons
in
the
caking
coals
were
probably
peat
which
accumulated
under
somewhat
uniform
conditions
was
constantly
saturated
with
moisture
and
became
a
comparatively
homogeneous
and
partially
gelatinous
carbonaceous
mass
while
the
coals
which
show
a
distinctly
laminated
structure
and
consist
of
layers
of
alternating
with
bands
of
mineral
charcoal
or
cannel
seem
to
have
been
formed
in
alternating
conditions
of
more
or
less
moisture
and
the
bituminous
portions
are
inclosed
in
cells
or
are
separated
by
partitions
so
that
the
mass
does
not
melt
down
but
more
or
less
perfectly
holds
its
form
when
exposed
to
heat
the
generalities
of
the
origin
and
relations
of
the
carbon
minerals
have
now
been
briefly
considered
but
a
review
of
the
subject
would
be
incomplete
without
some
reference
to
the
theories
which
have
been
advanced
by
others
that
are
in
conflict
with
the
views
now
presented
there
have
always
been
some
who
denied
the
organic
nature
of
the
mineral
hydrocarbons
but
it
has
been
regarded
as
a
sufficient
answer
to
their
theories
that
chemists
and
geologists
are
generally
agreed
in
saying
that
no
instances
are
known
of
the
occurrence
in
nature
of
hydrocarbons
solid
liquid
or
gaseous
in
which
the
evidence
was
not
satisfactory
that
they
had
been
derived
from
animal
or
vegetable
tissue
a
few
exceptional
cases
however
in
which
chemists
and
geologists
of
deserved
distinction
have
claimed
the
possibility
and
even
probability
of
the
production
of
marsh
gas
petroleum
through
inorganic
agencies
require
notice
in
a
paper
published
in
the
de
chimie
et
de
vol
berthelot
attempts
to
show
that
the
formation
of
petroleum
and
carbureted
hydrogen
from
inorganic
substances
is
possible
if
it
be
true
as
suggested
by
daubre
that
there
are
vast
masses
of
the
alkaline
metals
potassium
sodium
deeply
buried
in
the
earth
and
at
a
high
temperature
to
which
carbonic
acid
should
gain
access
and
he
demonstrates
that
these
premises
being
granted
the
formation
of
hydrocarbons
would
necessarily
follow
but
it
should
be
said
that
no
satisfactory
evidence
has
ever
been
offered
of
the
existence
of
zones
or
masses
of
the
unoxidized
alkaline
metals
in
the
earth
and
it
is
not
claimed
by
berthelot
that
there
are
any
facts
in
the
occurrence
of
petroleum
and
carbureted
hydrogen
in
nature
which
seem
to
exemplify
the
chemical
action
which
he
simply
claims
is
theoretically
possible
berthelot
also
says
that
in
most
cases
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
organic
origin
of
the
hydrocarbons
mendeleeff
in
the
discusses
at
considerable
length
the
genesis
of
petroleum
and
attempts
to
sustain
the
view
that
it
is
of
inorganic
origin
his
arguments
and
illustrations
are
chiefly
drawn
from
the
oil
wells
of
pennsylvania
and
canada
and
for
the
petroleum
of
these
two
districts
he
claims
an
inorganic
origin
because
as
he
says
there
are
no
accumulations
of
organic
matter
below
the
horizons
at
which
the
oils
and
gases
occur
he
then
goes
into
a
lengthy
discussion
of
the
possible
and
probable
source
of
petroleum
where
as
in
the
instances
cited
an
organic
origin
is
not
possible
it
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
mendeleeff
to
say
that
beneath
the
oil
bearing
strata
of
western
pennsylvania
are
sheets
of
bituminous
shale
from
one
hundred
to
five
hundred
feet
in
thickness
which
afford
an
adequate
and
it
may
be
proved
the
true
source
of
the
petroleum
and
that
no
petroleum
has
been
found
below
these
shales
also
that
the
of
canada
are
all
underlain
by
the
collingwood
shales
the
equivalent
of
the
utica
carbonaceous
shales
of
new
york
and
that
from
the
of
these
shales
petroleum
and
hydrocarbon
gases
are
constantly
escaping
with
a
better
knowledge
of
the
geology
of
the
districts
he
refers
to
he
would
have
seen
that
the
facts
in
the
cases
he
cites
afford
the
strongest
evidence
of
the
organic
origin
of
petroleum
among
those
who
are
agreed
as
to
the
organic
origin
of
the
hydrocarbons
there
is
yet
some
diversity
of
opinion
in
regard
to
the
nature
of
the
process
by
which
they
have
been
produced
lesley
has
at
various
times
advocated
the
theory
that
petroleum
is
indigenous
in
the
which
hold
it
and
has
been
derived
from
plants
buried
in
them
proc
amer
philos
vol
pp
etc
my
own
observations
do
not
sanction
this
view
as
the
limited
number
of
plants
buried
in
the
sandstones
which
are
now
reservoirs
of
petroleum
must
always
have
borne
a
small
proportion
in
volume
to
the
mass
of
inorganic
matter
and
some
of
those
which
are
saturated
with
petroleum
are
almost
completely
destitute
of
the
impressions
of
plants
in
all
cases
where
sandstones
contain
petroleum
in
quantity
i
think
it
will
be
found
that
there
are
sheets
of
carbonaceous
matter
below
from
which
carbureted
hydrogen
and
petroleum
are
constantly
issuing
a
more
probable
explanation
of
the
occurrence
of
petrolem
in
the
sandstones
is
that
they
have
from
their
porosity
become
convenient
receptacles
for
that
which
flowed
from
some
organic
stratum
below
sterry
hunt
has
regarded
limestones
and
especially
the
niagara
and
corniferous
as
the
principal
sources
of
our
petroleum
but
as
i
have
elsewhere
suggested
no
considerable
flow
of
petroleum
has
ever
been
obtained
from
the
niagara
limestone
though
at
chicago
and
niagara
falls
it
contains
a
large
quantity
of
bituminous
matter
also
that
the
corniferous
limestone
which
hunt
has
regarded
as
the
source
of
the
oil
of
canada
and
pennsylvania
is
too
thin
and
too
barren
of
petroleum
or
the
material
out
of
which
it
is
made
to
justify
the
inference
the
corniferous
limestone
is
never
more
than
fifty
or
sixty
feet
thick
and
does
not
contain
even
one
per
cent
of
hydrocarbons
and
in
southern
kentucky
where
oil
is
produced
in
large
quantity
this
limestone
does
not
exist
that
many
limestones
are
more
or
less
charged
with
petroleum
is
well
known
and
in
addition
to
those
mentioned
above
the
silurian
limestone
at
collingwood
canada
may
be
cited
as
an
example
as
i
have
elsewhere
shown
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
petroleum
here
is
indigenous
and
has
been
derived
in
part
at
least
from
animal
organisms
but
the
limestones
are
generally
compact
and
if
cellular
their
cavities
are
closed
and
the
amount
of
petroleum
which
under
any
circumstances
flows
from
or
can
be
extracted
from
limestone
rock
is
small
on
the
other
hand
the
bituminous
shales
which
underlie
the
different
oil
regions
afford
an
abundant
source
of
supply
holding
the
proper
relations
with
the
reservoirs
that
contain
the
oil
and
are
spontaneously
and
constantly
evolving
gas
and
oil
as
may
be
observed
in
a
great
number
of
localities
for
this
reason
while
confessing
the
occurrence
of
petroleum
and
asphaltum
in
many
limestones
i
am
thoroughly
convinced
that
little
or
none
of
the
petroleum
of
commerce
is
derived
from
them
peckham
who
has
studied
the
petroleum
field
of
southern
california
attributes
the
abundant
hydrocarbon
emanations
in
that
locality
to
microscopic
animals
it
is
quite
possible
that
this
is
true
in
this
and
other
localities
but
the
bituminous
shales
which
are
evidently
the
sources
of
the
petroleum
of
pennsylvania
ohio
kentucky
generally
contain
abundant
impressions
of
sea
weeds
and
indeed
these
are
almost
the
only
organisms
which
have
left
any
traces
in
them
i
am
inclined
therefore
now
as
in
my
report
on
the
rock
oils
of
ohio
published
in
to
ascribe
the
carbonaceous
matter
of
the
bituminous
shales
of
pennsylvania
and
ohio
and
hence
the
petroleum
derived
from
them
to
the
easily
decomposed
cellular
tissue
of
algæ
which
have
in
their
decomposition
contributed
a
large
percentage
of
diffused
carbonaceous
matter
to
the
sediments
accumulating
at
the
bottom
of
the
water
where
they
grew
in
a
recent
communication
to
the
national
academy
of
sciences
sterry
hunt
has
proposed
the
theory
that
anthracite
is
the
result
of
the
decomposition
of
vegetable
tissue
when
buried
in
porous
strata
like
sandstone
but
an
examination
of
even
a
few
of
the
important
deposits
of
anthracite
in
the
world
will
show
that
no
such
relationship
as
he
suggests
obtains
anthracite
may
and
does
occur
in
sedimentary
rocks
of
varied
character
but
so
far
as
my
observation
has
extended
never
in
quantity
in
sandstone
in
the
lower
silurian
rocks
anthracite
occurs
both
in
the
old
world
and
in
the
new
where
no
metamorphism
has
affected
it
and
where
it
is
simply
the
normal
result
of
the
long
continued
distillation
of
plant
tissue
but
the
anthracite
beds
which
are
known
and
mined
in
so
many
countries
are
the
results
of
the
metamorphism
of
of
one
or
another
age
by
local
outbursts
of
trap
or
the
steaming
and
baking
of
the
disturbed
strata
in
mountain
chains
numerous
instances
of
which
are
given
on
a
preceding
page
mendeleeff
in
his
article
already
referred
to
misled
by
a
want
of
knowledge
of
the
geology
of
our
and
ascribing
the
petroleum
to
an
inorganic
cause
connects
the
production
of
oil
in
pennsylvania
and
caucasia
with
the
neighboring
mountain
chains
of
the
alleghanies
and
the
caucasus
but
in
these
localities
a
sufficient
amount
of
organic
matter
can
be
found
to
supply
a
source
for
the
petroleum
while
the
upheaval
and
loosening
of
the
strata
along
lines
parallel
with
the
axes
of
elevation
has
favored
the
decomposition
spontaneous
distillation
of
the
carbonaceous
strata
it
should
be
distinctly
stated
also
that
no
igneous
rocks
are
found
in
the
vicinity
of
productive
here
or
elsewhere
and
there
are
no
facts
to
sustain
the
view
that
petroleum
is
a
volcanic
product
in
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
in
ohio
illinois
and
kentucky
are
great
deposits
of
petroleum
far
removed
from
any
mountain
chain
or
volcanic
vent
and
the
cases
which
have
been
cited
of
the
limited
production
of
hydrocarbons
in
the
vicinity
of
and
probably
in
connection
with
volcanic
centers
may
be
explained
by
supposing
that
in
these
cases
the
petroleum
is
distilled
from
sedimentary
strata
containing
organic
matter
by
the
proximity
of
melted
rock
or
steam
everything
indicates
that
the
distillation
which
has
produced
the
greatest
quantities
of
petroleum
known
was
effected
at
a
low
temperature
and
the
constant
escape
of
petroleum
and
carbureted
hydrogen
from
the
outcrops
of
bituminous
shales
as
well
as
the
result
of
weathering
on
the
shales
depriving
them
of
all
their
carbon
shows
that
the
distillation
and
complete
elimination
of
the
organic
matter
they
contain
may
take
place
at
the
ordinary
temperature
estimation
of
sulphur
in
iron
and
steel
by
george
craig
for
wellnigh
two
years
i
have
been
estimating
sulphur
in
iron
and
steel
by
a
modification
of
the
evolution
process
which
consists
in
passing
the
evolved
gases
through
an
ammoniacal
solution
of
peroxide
of
hydrogen
which
oxidizes
the
sulphureted
hydrogen
to
sulphuric
acid
which
latter
is
estimated
as
usual
the
is
as
follows
illustration
grains
of
the
iron
or
steel
are
placed
in
the
oz
flask
a
along
with
oz
water
oz
hydrochloric
acid
are
added
from
the
stoppered
funnel
b
in
such
quantities
at
a
time
as
to
produce
a
moderate
evolution
of
gas
through
the
nitrogen
bulb
c
which
contains
oz

peroxide
of
hydrogen
and
oz
ammonia
the
tube
d
is
to
condense
the
bulk
of
the
hydrochloric
acid
which
distills
over
during
the
operation
when
all
the
acid
has
been
added
and
the

of
gas
becomes
sluggish
heat
is
applied
and
the
liquid
boiled
till
all
action
ceases
air
is
blown
through
the
aparatus
for
a
few
minutes
and
the
contents
of

washed
into
a

beaker
and
acidified
with
hydrochloric
acid
boiled
barium
chloride
added
and
the
barium
sulphate
filtered
off
after
standing
a
short
time
a
blank
experiment
must
be
done
with
each
new
lot
of
peroxide
of
hydrogen
obtained
which
always
gives
under
barium
sulphate
with
me
the
whole
operation
is
finished
within
two
hours
the
usual
oxidation
process
occupying
nearly
two
days
and
the
results
obtained
are
invariably
slightly
higher
than
by
the
oxidation
processes
until
lately
i
have
always
added
excess
of
chlorate
of
potash
to
the
residue
left
in
a
evaporated

nearly
to

diluted
filtered
and
added
chloride
of
barium
to
the
diluted
filtrate
but
only
once
have
i
obtained
a
trace
of
precipitate
after
standing
hours
and
the
in
that
case
contained
per
cent
of
silicon
so
that
all
the
sulphur
is
evolved
during
the
process
it
has
been
objected
to
the
evolution
process
that
when
the
iron
contains
copper
all
the
sulphur
is
not
evolved
but
theoretically
it
ought
to
be
evolved
whether
copper
is
present
or
not
and
to
test
the
point
i
fused
lb
of
ordinary
scotch
with
some
copper
for
half
an
hour
in
a
fletcher
gas
furnace
no
copper
could
be
detected
in
the
iron
by
mere
observation
with
a
microscope
but
it
gave
on
analysis
per
cent
of
copper
and
on
estimating
the
sulphur
in
it
by
the
above
process
and
by
oxidation
with
chlorate
of
potash
and
hydrochloric
acid
using
grains
in
each
case
and
performing
blank
experiments
i
found
by
peroxide
of
hydrogen
process
per
cent
by
oxidation
and
hcl
process
so
that
even
in
highly
cupriferous
all
the
sulphur
is
evolved

abstract
of
a
lecture
before
the
master
association
new
york
by
chandler
it
is
only
about
one
hundred
years
since
the
first
important
facts
were
discovered
which
threw
light
upon
the
chemistry
of
atmosphere
it
was
in
that
priestley
in
london
and
scheele
in
sweden
discovered
the
vital
constituents
of
the
atmosphere
the
oxygen
gas
which
supports
life
the
inert
gas
nitrogen
had
been
discovered
a
year
or
two
before
when
we
examine
our
atmosphere
we
find
it
is
composed
of
oxygen
and
nitrogen
the
nitrogen
constitutes
no
less
than
per
cent
of
the
atmosphere
the
remaining
percent
consists
of
oxygen
so
that
the
atmosphere
consists
almost
entirely
of
these
two
gases
odorless
and
colorless
and
invisible
the
atmosphere
is
however
never
free
from
moisture
a
certain
amount
of
aqueous
vapor
is
always
present
the
quantity
can
hardly
be
stated
as
it
varies
from
day
to
day
and
month
to
month
it
depends
upon
the
temperature
and
other
conditions
then
we
have
the
gas
commonly
called
carbonic
acid
in
extremely
minute
quantities
about
one
part
in
or
four
of
one
per
cent
a
small
quantity
of
ammonia
and
a
small
quantity
of
ozone
are
also
present
besides
these
gases
which
have
been
enumerated
and
which
play
an
important
part
in
supporting
life
in
both
the
kingdoms
of
nature
we
find
a
great
many
solids
every
housewife
knows
how
dust
settles
upon
everything
about
the
house
this
dust
has
recently
been
the
subject
of
most
active
study
and
it
proves
to
be
quite
as
important
as
the
vital
oxygen
that
actually
supports
life
when
we
examine
this
dust
and
it
falls
everywhere
not
only
in
the
city
streets
but
upon
the
tops
of
mountains
upon
the
deck
of
the
ocean
steamer
and
the
arctic
snow
we
find
some
of
it
does
not
belong
to
the
earth
and
as
it
is
not
terrestrial
we
call
it
cosmical
and
when
it
falls
in
large
pieces
we
call
it
a
meteorite
or
shooting
star
when
the
challenger
crossed
the
atlantic
and
soundings
were
made
in
the
deep
sea
in
the
mud
that
was
brought
up
and
examined
there
were
found
various
little
particles
that
were
not
terrestrial
they
were
dust
particles
that
were
dropped
into
the
atmosphere
of
the
earth
from
outer
space
then
we
have
terrestrial
dust
and
we
divide
that
into
mineral
and
organic
the
mineral
consists
chiefly
of
clay
sand
and
near
the
ocean
salt
then
we
have
organic
matter
some
of
this
is
dead
leaves
which
have
been
ground
to
powder
animal
matter
has
also
become
dry
and
reduced
to
powder
and
we
actually
find
the
remains
of
animals
and
plants
floating
upon
the
atmosphere
especially
in
the
city
examinations
of
the
dust
which
had
collected
upon
the
basement
and
higher
windows
of
a
fifth
avenue
residence
showed
that
the
dust
upon
the
basement
floor
was
chiefly
composed
of
sand
and
the
higher
up
i
went
the
smaller
proportion
of
sand
and
a
larger
proportion
of
animal
matter
so
that
the
dust
that
blows
into
our
faces
is
largely
decomposing
animal
substance
but
we
have
a
living
matter
in
the
atmosphere
we
often
notice
in
the
summer
after
a
rain
that
the
ground
is
yellow
on
gathering
up
the
yellow
powder
and
examining
it
under
the
microscope
we
find
that
it
consists
of
pollen
the
pollen
of
rag
weed
and
other
plants
is
supposed
to
be
the
cause
of
hay
fever
but
we
also
have
something
far
more
important
in
the
germs
of
certain
classes
of
vegetation
the
effects
are
familiar
if
food
is
put
away
it
becomes
mouldy
this
mould
is
a
peculiar
kind
of
vegetation
which
is
called
a
fungus
and
the
plants
fungi
in
order
for
this
mould
to
develop
a
certain
temperature
and
a
certain
degree
of
moisture
are
necessary
our
food
we
say
decays
now
what
we
call
decay
is
really
the
growth
of
these
fungi
animal
and
vegetable
substances
which
these
fungi
seize
upon
are
destroyed
all
ordinary
fermentations
and
putrefactions
are
due
to
mould
fungi
yeast
plants
or
bacteria
and
liquids
undergoing
these
processes
carry
these
fungi
and
their
germs
wherever
they
go
the
refuse
of
the
city
pollutes
the
air
you
have
only
to
pass
along
any
street
to
find
more
or
less
rubbish
that
furnishes
the
nidus
for
the
growth
and
development
of
these
germs
and
until
we
adopt
better
methods
of
getting
rid
of
that
refuse
we
never
shall
have
the
air
of
this
city
in
the
condition
that
it
should
be
one
of
the
most
constant
sources
of
the
pollution
of
the
air
in
inhabited
localities
is
the
decomposition
that
takes
place
in
the
ground
refuse
of
every
kind
gets
into
it
our
sewers
are
leaky
and
putrefaction
is
constantly
going
on
the
soil
down
to
the
limit
of
the
ground
water
contains
a
large
amount
of
air
this
air
when
the
atmospheric
pressure
in
the
house
is
diminished
is
drawn
in
with
such
organic
impurities
as
it
contains
a
cement
floor
in
the
cellar
is
not
a
protection
against
this
entrance
of
the
ground
air
for
the
cement
is
porous
to
the
passage
of
air
but
a
remedy
may
be
found
by
laying
on
the
cement
a
covering
of
coal
tar
pitch
in
which
bricks
are
set
on
edge
the
spaces
between
the
bricks
are
filled
with
the
melted
pitch
and
the
bricks
then
covered
with
coal
tar
pitch
when
the
house
is
building
the
foundation
walls
should
also
be
similarly
coated
outside
as
well
as
inside
such
a
cellar
floor
was
considered
to
be
absolutely
impervious
to
ground
air
and
moisture
the
lecturer
had
recently
laid
this
floor
in
his
own
house
with
the
greatest
success
the
atmosphere
of
the
entire
house
is
improved
and
the
expense
is
very
moderate
another
source
of
the
contamination
of
the
air
of
houses
is
the
heating
apparatus
stoves
and
furnaces
however
well
constructed
at
first
will
from
the
contraction
and
expansion
of
the
metal
soon
allow
the
escape
of
coal
gas
and
this
danger
is
greatly
increased
by
the
use
of
dampers
in

chandler
having
kept
a
record
of
accidents
from
this
cause
had
accumulated
a
formidable
list
of
suffocations
due
to
the
use
of
the
damper
the
danger
was
now
somewhat
lessened
by
providing
dampers
with
perforations
in
the
center
which
allowed
the
gases
to
escape
when
the
damper
was
closed
as
regards
the
maintenance
of
pure
air
in
houses
the
preference
was
given
to
the
open
the
furnace
deriving
a
supply
of
pure
air
from
out
of
doors
was
when
properly
constructed
a
very
satisfactory
method
of
heating
but
in
city
houses
the
mistake
was
often
made
of
carrying
the
cold
air
duct
of
the
furnace
to
the
front
of
the
house
where
it
was
exposed
to
the
dust
of
the
streets
it
should
be
taken
from
the
rear
end
of
the
house
and
carried
some
distance
above
the
surface
of
the
yard
it
was
an
excellent
expedient
to
insert
in
the
cold
air
duct
a
wire
screen
to
hold
a
layer
of
cotton
to
retain
the
floating
impurities
which
might
enter
the
this
could
be
removed
from
time
to
time
and
the
cotton
replaced
steam
heating
has
been
objected
to
by
many
for
reasons
in
no
wise
due
to
the
apparatus
but
to
neglect
in
the
use
of
it
the
complaint
of
closeness
where
steam
is
used
is
due
to
the
fact
that
a
room
containing
a
steam
radiator
can
be
heated
with
every
door
and
window
closed
and
no
fresh
air
admitted
while
with
stoves
and
open
a
certain
quantity
of
fresh
air
must
be
admitted
to
maintain
the
fire
where
radiators
are
used
the
ventilation
of
the
rooms
should
therefore
be
looked
after
again
the
complaint
that
steam
apparatus
has
an
unpleasant
odor
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
radiators
are
allowed
to
become
covered
with
dust
which
is
cooked
and
gives
rise
to
the
smells
complained
of
the
radiator
should
be
from
time
to
time
cleaned
when
these
precautions
are
taken
no
means
of
heating
is
more
satisfactory
than
steam
sewer
gas
is
another
source
of
contamination
this
is
a
very
indefinite
term
to
which
formerly
many
false
and
exaggerated
properties
of
causing
specific
diseases
were
attributed
it
is
now
however
recognized
to
mean
simply
the
air
of
sewers
generally
not
differing
very
greatly
from
common
air
containing
a
certain
proportion
of
marsh
gas
carbonic
acid
and
sulphureted
hydrogen
etc
no
one
of
these
gases
however
is
capable
of
producing
the
diseases
attributed
to
sewer
gas
careful
research
has
shown
that
it
is
the
sewage
itself
containing
germs
of
specific
disease
which
is
added
to
the
air
in
the
sewer
by
the
breaking
of
bubbles
of
gas
on
its
surface
which
is
the
cause
of
the
diseases
associated
with
sewers
an
intimate
connection
is
believed
to
exist
between
the
germs
of
sewer
air
and
diphtheria
and
probably
also
between
sewer
air
and
scarlet
fever
this
sewer
gas
is
to
be
excluded
from
our
houses
by
proper
systems
of
plumbing
and
to
such
an
extent
have
these
now
been
perfected
that
there
is
no
objection
to
having
plumbing
fixtures
in
all
parts
of
the
house
this
opinion
has
lately
been
objected
to
in
the
science
as
it
was
at
a
meeting
of
the
academy
of
medicine
last
spring
but
on
wholly
insufficient
grounds
the
objectors
all
insist
that
a
trap
will
allow
sewer
gas
to
pass
through
it
and
the
experiments
made
at
the
academy
of
medicine
showed
that
sulphureted
hydrogen
gas
would
so
pass
the
advocates
of
the
trap
have
never
denied
that
the
water
seal
would
absorb
gases
on
one
side
and
give
them
off
on
the
other
but
they
do
deny
that
in
the
conditions
existing
in
good
plumbing
such
gases
will
be
given
off
in
quantities
to
do
any
damage
and
they
confidently
assert
that
the
germ
which
is
the
dangerous
element
will
not
pass
the
seal
at
all
pumpelly
investigated
the
matter
for
the
national
board
of
health
and
in
no
instance
was
he
able
to
make
the
germ
pass
the
seal
of
the
trap
it
is
now
proposed
to
set
up
against
the
weight
of
this
scientific
testimony
the
results
of
an
investigator
in
chicago
whose
work
was
at
once
appropriated
as
an
advertisement
by
stock
jobbing
disinfectant
companies
in
a
manner
which
raises
a
suspicion
that
the
investigation
was
made
in
their
interest
he
described
tersely
the
essentials
of
good
plumbing
the
necessity
of
a
trap
on
the
house
drain
the
ventilation
of
the
and
the
ventilation
of
the
trap
against
siphonage
of
the
first
he
said
that
it
offered
protection
to
each
householder
against
the
entrance
into
his
house
of
the
germs
of
a
contagious
disease
which
passed
into
the
common
sewer
from
the
house
of
a
neighbor
were
the
trap
dispensed
with
the
contagion
in
the
sewer
would
have
free
entrance
into
the
houses
connecting
with
it
chandler
in
conclusion
alluded
to
the
cordial
relations
now
existing
between
the
board
of
health
and
the
majority
of
the
master
plumbers
of
the
city
he
said
that
for
himself
his
opinion
of
the
craft
had
greatly
risen
during
his
intimate
connection
with
plumbers
the
last
two
years
he
thought
the
majority
of
the
jobs
now
done
in
the
city
are
well
executed
he
believed
that
the
board
of
health
had
not
been
obliged
to
proceed
against
more
than
eight
master
plumbers
since
the
new
law
went
into
force
he
called
upon
the
association
to
adopt
a
code
of
ethics
which
should
define
what
an
honest
plumber
can
do
and
can
not
do
and
he
illustrated
his
meaning
by
citing
an
extraordinary
case
of
fraudulent
workmanship
which
had
been
recently
reported
to
him
his
remarks
on
this
point
were
greeted
with
frequent
outbursts
of
applause
the
plantain
as
a
styptic
the
following
abstract
of
a
paper
read
by
quinlan
at
the
recent
british
pharmaceutical
congress
may
prove
of
interest
to
medical
readers
in
this
country
where
the
plant
mentioned
is
a
common
weed
about
a
year
ago
quinlan
had
seen
the
chewed
leaves
of
the
successfully
used
to
stop
a
dangerous
hemorrhage
from
leech
bites
in
a
situation
where
pressure
could
not
be
employed
he
had
searched
out
the
literature
of
the
subject
and
found
that
although
this
herb
is
highly
spoken
of
by
culpepper
and
other
old
writers
as
a
styptic
and
alluded
to
as
such
in
the
plays
of
shakespeare
its
employment
seems
to
have
died
out
professor
quinlan
described
the
suitable
varieties
of
plantain
and
exhibited
preparations
which
had
been
made
for
him
by
evans
of
dublin
state
apothecary
they
dried
leaves
and
powdered
leaves
conserved
with
glycerine
for
external
use
the
juice
preserved
by
alcohol
as
also
by
glycerine
for
internal
use
and
a
green
extract
he
gave
an
account
of
the
chemistry
of
the
juice
from
which
it
appeared
that
it
was
not
a
member
of
the
tannin
series
and
also
described
its
physiological
effect
in
causing
a
tendency
to
stasia
in
the
capillaries
of
the
tail
of
a
goldfish
examined
with
a
microscopic
power
of
x
he
regarded
its
styptic
power
as
partly
mechanical
and
partly
physiological
the
juice
in
large
doses
he
had
found
useful
in
internal
hemorrhages
the
knowledge
of
the
properties
of
this
plant
he
thought
would
be
useful
in
cases
of
emergency
because
it
could
be
obtained
in
any
field
and
by
the
most
uninstructed
persons
bacteria
bacteria
whether
significant
of
disease
or
decline
of
health
are
found
more
or
less
numerous
in
everything
we
eat
and
drink
the
germs
or
spores
of
many
kinds
known
as
tenue
spirillum
vibriones
etc
exist
in
almost
infinite
numbers
some
of
the
smallest
are
too
small
to
be
seen
by
the
highest
powers
which
being
lodged
in
all
vegetable
and
animal
substances
spring
into
life
and
develop
very
rapidly
under
favorable
circumstances
they
develop
most
rapidly
when
decomposition
commences
and
seem
to
indicate
the
degree
or
activity
of
that
decomposition
also
hastening
the
same
they
are
found
most
numerous
in
the
feces
and
usually
fully
developed
in
the
fresh
evacuations
of
persons
of
all
ages
they
may
be
seen
plainly
under
a
thin
glass
with
high
powers
with
strong
or
clear
light
when
the
material
is
much
diluted
with
water
these
bacteria
appear
almost
as
numerously
yet
more
slowly
in
urine
either
upon
exposure
to
air
or
when
freshly
evacuated
when
the
general
health
of
the
individual
is
declining
or
any
tendency
to
decomposition
a
diagnosis
can
be
aided
very
greatly
by
a
study
of
these
bacteria
as
they
indicate
or
determine
the
vitality
vigor
and
purity
of
the
system
whether
more
or
less
subject
to
disease
even
before
any
signs
of
disease
appear
they
seem
to
preindicate
the
hold
of
the
life
force
on
the
material
and
always
appear
when
that
force
is
broken
their
relative
quantity
found
in
feces
is
as
a
barometric
indication
of
the
general
health
or
some
particular
disturbance
and
it
is
surprising
how
very
fast
they
multiply
while
simply
passing
the
intestines
under
circumstances
favorable
for
their
growth
these
forms
so
small
are
important
because
so
very
numerous
and
their
study
has
been
perhaps
avoided
by
many
yet
they
certainly
mean
something
and
effect
something
even
the
varieties
as
mentioned
above
and
it
is
certainly
worth
while
to
continue
to
study
their
meaning
even
beyond
what
has
already
been
written
by
others
on
the
adams
in
the
the
soy
bean
a
good
deal
of
attention
has
lately
been
directed
to
this
plant
in
consequence
of
the
enormous
extent
to
which
it
is
cultivated
in
china
for
the
sake
of
the
small
seeds
which
it
produces
and
which
are
known
as
soy
beans
these
vary
considerably
in
size
shape
and
color
according
to
the
variety
of
the
plant
which
produces
them
they
are
for
the
most
part
about
the
size
and
shape
of
an
ordinary
field
pea
and
like
the
pea
are
of
a
yellow
color
some
however
are
of
a
greenish
tint
these
seeds
contain
a
large
quantity
of
oil
which
is
expressed
from
them
in
china
and
used
for
a
variety
of
purposes
the
residue
is
moulded
with
a
considerable
amount
of
pressure
into
large
circular
cakes
two
feet
or
more
across
and
six
inches
or
eight
inches
thick
this
cake
is
used
either
for
feeding
cattle
or
for
manuring
the
land
indeed
a
very
large
trade
is
done
in
china
with
bean
cake
as
it
is
always
called
for
these
purposes
the
sauce
called
soy
is
also
prepared
from
seeds
of
this
bean
the
plant
generally
known
as
soja

is
by
modern
botanists
referred
to
glycine
soja
it
is
an
erect
hairy
herbaceous
plant
the
leaves
are
and
the
papilionaceous
flowers
are
born
in
axillary
racemes
it
is
too
tender
for
outdoor
cultivation
in
this
country
but
has
been
recommended
for
extended
growth
in
our
colonies
as
a
commercial
plant

philesia
buxifolia
we
figure
this
plant
not
as
a
novelty
but
for
the
purpose
of
showing
what
a
fine
thing
it
is
when
grown
under
propitious
circumstances
generally
we
see
it
more
or
less
starved
in
the
greenhouse
and
even
when
planted
out
in
the
winter
garden
its
flowers
lack
the
size
and
richness
of
color
they
attain
it
comes
from
the
extreme
south
of
south
america
which
accounts
for
its
hardihood
and
is
a
near
ally
of
the
lapageria
the
latter
is
remarkable
for
withstanding
even
the
noxious
fumes
of
the
copper
smelting
works
in
chili
and
as
the
philesia
has
similar
tough
leaves
it
is
probable
that
it
would
support
the
vitiated
atmosphere
of
a
town
better
than
most
evergreens
in
any
case
there
is
no
reasonable
doubt
but
that
if
cultivators
would
take
the
necessary
pains
they
might
select
perfectly
hardy
varieties
both
of
the
lapageria
and
of
the
philesia
as
it
is
we
can
only
call
the
philesea
north
of
the
thames
while
the
lapageria
is
not
even

age
the
dream
of

caused
matters
of
more

to

neglected
the
first
that

to

was
about
a

having
been
sent

by
a

time
the
trunk
of

furnishes
timber
of
the
largest
dimensions
but
that
from
the

is
preferred
for
ornamental
purposes
owing
to
its
closer
grain
and
more

its

is
rapid
but
the
most
valuable
trees
grow
slowly
among

on
sterile

to
gather

most
desolate

once
flourished
that
curiously
veined
and
much
esteemed
variety
once
known
in

as
madeira
wood

which
has
long
since
been
exterminated
jamaica
also
which
used
to
be
a
fruitful
source
of
mahogany
and
whence
in
not

is
now
almost

san
domingo
or

in
a
dry
state
mahogany
is
very
durable
and
not
liable
to
the
attack
of
worms
but
when
exposed
to
the
weather
it
does
not
last
long
it
would
therefore
make
excellent
material
for
floors
roofs
but
its
costliness
limits
its
utility
in
this
direction
and
it
is
chiefly
employed
for
furniture
doors
and
a
few
other
articles
of
joinery
for
which
it
is
among
the
best
materials
known
it
has
been
used
for
sashes
and
window
frames
but
is
not
desirable
for
this
purpose
on
account
of
the
ease
with
which
it
is
affected
by
the
weather
it
has
also
been
used
in
england
to
some
extent
for
the
framing
of
machinery
in
its
color
is
a
reddish
brown
of
different
shades
and
luster
sometimes
becoming
a
yellowish
brown
and
often
much
veined
and
mottled
with
darker
shades
of
the
same
color
its
texture
is
uniform
and
the
rings
indicating
its
annual
growth
are
not
very
distinct
the
larger
medullary
rays
are
absent
but
the
smaller
ones
are
often
very
distinct
with
pores
between
them
in
the
jamaica
woods
these
pores
are
often
filled
with
a
white
substance
but
in
that
brought
from
central
america
they
are
generally
empty
it
has
neither
taste
nor

shrinks
very
slightly

wood
the
variety
called
spanish
mahogany
comes
from
the
west
indies
and
is
in
smaller
logs
than
the
honduras
mahogany
being
generally
about
two
feet
square
and
ten
feet
long
it
is
close
grained
and
hard
generally
darker
than
the
honduras
free
from
black
specks
and
sometimes
strongly
marked
the
pores
appear
as
though
chalk
had
been
rubbed
into
them
the
honduras
mahogany
comes
in
logs
from
two
to
four
feet
square
and
twelve
to
fourteen
long
planks
have
been
obtained
seven
feet
wide
its
grain
is
very
open
and
often
irregular
with
black
or
gray
specks
the
veins
and
figures
are
often
very
distinct
and
handsome
and
that
of
a
fine
golden
color
and
free
from
gray
specks
is
considered
the
best
it
holds
the
glue
better
than
any
other
wood
the
weight
of
a
cubic
foot
of
mahogany
varies
from
to
pounds
its
strength
is
between
and
stiffness
to
and
toughness
to
oak
being
considered
as
one
hundred
in
each
case
there
are
three
other
species
of
the
genus
besides
the
mahogany
tree
two
of
them
natives
of
the
east
indies
one
is
a
very
large
tree
growing
in
the
mountainous
parts
of
central
hindostan
and
rises
to
a
great
height
throwing
out
many
branches
toward
the
top
the
head
is
spreading
and
the
leaves
bear
some
resemblance
to
those
of
the
american
species
the
wood
is
a
dull
red
not
so
beautiful
as
that
known
to
commerce
but
harder
heavier
and
more
durable
the
natives
of
india
consider
it
the
most
durable
timber
which
their
forests
afford
and
consequently
use
it
when
it
can
be
procured
wherever
strength
and
durability
are
particularly
desired
the
other
east
indian
species
is
found
in
the
mountains
of
sircars
which
run
parallel
to
the
bay
of
bengal
the
tree
is
not
so
large
as
any
of
the
other
species
described
and
the
wood
is
of
much
different
appearance
being
of
a
deep
yellow
considerably
resembling
box
the
grain
is
close
and
the
wood
both
heavy
and
durable
the
third
species
known
as
african
mahogany
is
brought
from
sierra
leone
it
is
hard
and
durable
and
used
for
purposes
requiring
these
properties
in
an
eminent
degree
if
however
the
heart
of
the

has
been
often
copied
by

pearls
the

it
immediately
fortifies
itself
by
covering

only
in
this
