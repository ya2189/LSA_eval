preface
patriotism
or
love
of
country
is
one
of
the
tests
of
nobility
of
character
no
great
man
ever
lived
that
was
not
a
patriot
in
the
highest
and
truest
sense
from
the
earliest
times
the
sentiment
of
patriotism
has
been
aroused
in
the
hearts
of
men
by
the
narrative
of
heroic
deeds
inspired
by
love
of
country
and
love
of
liberty
this
truth
furnishes
the
key
to
the
arrangement
and
method
of
the
present
work
the
ten
epochs
treated
are
those
that
have
been
potential
in
shaping
subsequent
events
and
when
men
have
struck
blows
for
human
liberty
against
odds
and
regardless
of
personal
consequences
the
simple
narrative
carries
its
own
morals
and
the
most
profitable
work
for
the
teacher
will
be
to
merely
supplement
the
narrative
so
that
the
picture
presented
shall
be
all
the
more
vivid
moral
reflections

ten
great
events
in
history
chapter
i
of
freedom
by
greek
the
great
events
in
history
are
those
where
upon
special
occasions
a
man
or
a
people
have
made
a
stand
against
tyranny
and
have
preserved
or
advanced
freedom
for
the
people
sometimes
tyranny
has
taken
the
form
of
the
oppression
of
the
many
by
the
few
in
the
same
nation
and
sometimes
it
has
been
the
oppression
of
a
weak
nation
by
a
stronger
one
the
successful
revolt
against
tyranny
the
terrible
conflict
resulting
in
the
emancipation
of
a
people
has
always
been
the
favorite
theme
of
the
historian
marking
as
it
does
a
step
in
the
progress
of
mankind
from
a
savage
to
a
civilized
state
one
of
the
earliest
as
well
as
most
notable
of
these
conflicts
of
which
we
have
an
authentic
account
took
place
in
greece
hundred
years
ago
or
five
hundred
years
before
the
christian
era
at
that
time
nearly
all
of
europe
was
inhabited
by
rude
barbarous
tribes
in
all
that
broad
land
the
arts
and
sciences
which
denote
civilization
had
made
their
appearance
only
in
the
small
and
apparently
insignificant
peninsula
of
greece
lying
on
the
extreme
southeast
border
adjoining
asia
at
a
period
before
authentic
history
begins
it
is
probable
that
roving
tribes
of
shepherds
from
the
north
took
possession
of
the
hills
and
valleys
of
greece
shut
off
on
the
north
by
mountain
ranges
and
on
all
other
sides
surrounded
by
the
sea
these
tribes
were
able
to
maintain
a
sturdy
independence
for
many
hundred
years
the
numerous
harbors
and
bays
which
subdivide
greece
invited
to
a
maritime
life
and
at
a
very
early
time
the
descendants
of
the
original
shepherds
became
skillful
navigators
and
courageous
adventurers
the
voyages
of
aeneas
and
ulysses
in
the
siege
of
troy
and
those
of
jason
in
search
of
the
golden
fleece
and
of
perseus
to
the
court
of
king
minos
are
the
mythological
accounts
embellished
by
imagination
and
distorted
by
time
of
what
were
real
voyages
crossing
the
mediterranean
grecian
adventurers
became
acquainted
with
the
egyptians
then
the
most
civilized
people
of
the
world
and
from
egypt
they
took
back
to
their
native
country
the
germs
of
the
arts
and
sciences
which
afterward
made
greece
so
famous
thence
improvements
went
forward
with
rapid
strides
hints
received
from
egypt
were
reproduced
in
higher
forms
massive
temples
became
light
and
airy
rude
sculpture
became
beautiful
by
conforming
to
natural
forms
and
hieroglyphics
developed
into
the
letters
which
cadmus
invented
or
improved
schools
were
established
athletic
sports
were
encouraged
aesthetic
taste
was
developed
until
in
the
arts
in
philosophy
in
science
and
in
literature
the
greeks
took
the
lead
of
all
peoples
as
population
increased
colonies
went
out
settling
upon
the
adjacent
coasts
of
asia
and
upon
the
islands
farther
west
in
asia
the
greek
colonists
were
subject
to
the
persian
empire
which
then
extended
its
rule
over
all
western
asia
and
claimed
dominion
over
africa
and
eastern
europe
the
greeks
fresh
from
the
freedom
of
their
native
land
could
not
patiently
endure
the
extortions
of
the
persian
government
to
which
their
own
people
submitted
without
question
hence
conflicts
arose
which
finally
culminated
in
persia
taking
complete
possession
of
the
asiatic
greek
cities
but
the
ties
of
kinship
were
strong
and
the
people
of
greece
keenly
resented
the
tyranny
which
had
been
exercised
over
their
countrymen
and
an
irrepressible
conflict
arose
between
the
two
nations
the
persian
king
darius
determined
to
put
an
end
to
all
annoyance
by
invading
and
subjugating
greece
before
the
final
march
of
his
army
darius
sent
heralds
throughout
greece
demanding
soil
and
water
as
an
acknowledgment
of
the
supremacy
of
persia
but
herodotus
says
that
at
sparta
when
this
impudent
demand
was
made
the
heralds
were
thrown
into
wells
and
told
to
help
themselves
to
all
the
earth
and
water
they
liked
after
a
long
preparation
in
an
army
of
one
hundred
thousand
men
or
more
under
the
command
of
artaphernes
convoyed
by
a
formidable
fleet
invaded
greece
for
a
long
time
it
met
with
little
opposition
and
city
after
city
submitted
to
the
overwhelming
hosts
of
the
persian
king
the
approach
to
athens
was
regarded
as
the
final
turning
point
of
the
war
artaphernes
selected
the
plains
of
marathon
miles
to
the
northeast
of
athens
as
the
place
of
his
final
landing
his
forces
by
the
lowest
estimate
consisted
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
of
which
ten
thousand
were
cavalry
to
these
were
opposed
the
army
of
athens
and
its
allies
consisting
in
all
of
ten
thousand
men
the
forms
an
irregular
crescent
six
miles
long
and
two
broad
in
its
widest
part
it
is
bounded
on
one
side
by
the
sea
and
on
the
other
by
a
rampart
of
mountains
at
the
time
of
the
battle
the
extremities
of
the
plain
were
flanked
by
swamps
diminishing
the
extent
of
the
front
and
hampering
the
operations
of
the
larger
army
the
command
of
the
greek
army
had
been
intrusted
to
ten
generals
who
ruled
successively
one
day
each
themistocles
one
of
these
generals
resigned
his
day
in
favor
of
miltiades
and
all
the
others
followed
his
example
and
so
the
battle
was
set
ten
thousand
greeks
under
miltiades
against
the
overwhelming
hosts
of
the
enemy
the
persians
confident
in
their
numbers
erected
no
intrenchments
they
did
not
dream
of
an
attack
from
the
little
band
of
greeks
there
is
evidence
to
believe
that
they
were
dissatisfied
with
the
nature
of
the
they
had
chosen
and
were
upon
the
point
of
embarking
to
land
at
some
point
nearer
the
city
if
this
was
the
case
they
were
very
rudely
awakened
from
their
dream
of
security
by
the
movement
of
the
greeks
on
the
morning
of
the
tenth
day
after
leaving
athens
miltiades
drew
up
his
army
in
order
of
battle
he
was
obliged
to
perilously
weaken
his
center
in
order
to
confront
the
whole
of
the
persian
army
so
as
to
avoid
the
danger
of
being
outflanked
and
surrounded
the
greeks
began
the
battle
by
a
furious
attack
along
the
whole
line
endeavoring
to
close
in
a
conflict
as
soon
as
possible
so
as
to
avoid
the
deadly
arrows
of
the
persians
and
to
take
the
advantage
of
their
heavier
arms
the
persians
were
greatly
astonished
when
they
saw
this
little
band
rushing
against
them
with
such
a
headlong
dash
and
thought
that
the
greeks
must
have
been
seized
with
madness
the
persian
general
had
concentrated
his
forces
at
the
center
and
at
this
part
of
the
the
fiery
onset
of
greeks
was
checked
by
mere
weight
of
numbers
but
at
length
the
mighty
persian
force
moved
irresistibly
forward
forcing
the
greeks
slowly
backward
fighting
dying
but
never
yielding
soon
the
greek
army
were
cut
in
two
and
the
persians
marched
proudly
onward
to
assured
victory
but
the
battle
was
not
yet
over
the
genius
of
miltiades
had
anticipated
this
result
the
wings
of
the
greek
army
strengthened
at
the
expense
of
the
center
fell
upon
the
weakened
wings
of
the
persians
with
irresistable
onset
the
invaders
were
forced
back
step
by
step
the
retreat
soon
changing
into
a
wild
and
promiscuous
rout
and
two
thirds
of
the
persian
army
ceased
to
exist
as
a
fighting
force
the
victorious
greeks
now
turned
their
attention
to
the
persian
center
falling
upon
its
flanks
with
incredible
fury
surrounded
on
all
sides
for
a
time
the
persians
maintained
their
old
reputation
as
valiant
soldiers
but
nothing
could
withstand
the
impetuosity
of
the
greeks
and
soon
the
whole
of
the
invading
hosts
were
in
tumultuous
retreat
the
victorious
greeks
pressed
rapidly
forward
to
prevent
the
foe
from
embarking
and
if
possible
to
capture
some
of
the
ships
but
the
persian
archers
held
the
victors
in
check
until
the
flying
soldiery
were
embarked
and
the
greeks
obtained
possession
of
only
seven
vessels
but
they
were
left
in
undisputed
possession
of
the
field
of
battle
the
camp
of
the
enemy
and
an
immense
amount
of
treasure
which
had
been
abandoned
in
the
precipitate
flight
six
thousand
four
hundred
persian
dead
remained
on
the
plain
while
the
greek
loss
was
one
hundred
and
all
athens
hastened
to
welcome
the
brave
soldiery
a
spartan
force
on
its
way
to
join
the
athenians
arrived
too
late
to
take
part
in
the
battle
and
they
quietly
returned
home
as
the
news
spread
loud
and
frantic
rejoicings
were
heard
throughout
greece
and
the
name
of
persia
so
long
a
dread
and
a
menace
lost
much
of
its
terrors
illustration
at
but
the
battle
of
marathon
and
the
victory
of
miltiades
had
a
wider
significance
than
could
enter
into
the
imaginations
of
then
living
man
it
was
a
conflict
between
the
barbarism
of
asia
and
the
dawning
civilization
of
europe
between
oriental
despotism
and
human
liberty
the
victory
rendered
normal
human
growth
possible
and
to
use
the
expressive
phrase
of
the
modern
poet
henceforth
to
the
sunset
unchecked
on
its
way
shall
liberty
follow
the
march
of
the
day
it
was
not
for
the
greeks
alone
but
for
all
ages
and
all
peoples
and
in
this
western
world
when
we
celebrate
the
birth
of
our
own
country
we
should
ever
keep
in
mind
the
desperate
struggle
at
marathon
and
the
valor
of
miltiades
and
his
greek
soldiery
but
the
war
was
not
yet
over
a
single
defeat
did
not
extinguish
the
hopes
of
the
persian
monarch
nor
exhaust
the
resources
of
his
empire
herodotus
says
now
darius
was
very
bitter
against
the
athenians
and
when
he
heard
the
tale
of
the
battle
of
marathon
he
was
much
more
wroth
and
desired
much
more
eagerly
to
march
against
hellas
straightway
he
sent
heralds
to
all
the
cities
and
bade
them
make
ready
an
army
and
to
furnish
much
more
than
they
had
done
before
both
ships
and
horses
and
corn
and
while
the
heralds
were
going
round
all
asia
was
shaken
for
three
years
but
in
the
fourth
year
the
egyptians
who
had
been
made
slaves
by
cambyses
rebelled
against
the
persians
and
then
the
king
sought
only
the
more
vehemently
to
go
both
against
the
egyptians
and
against
the
greeks
so
he
named
xerxes
his
son
to
be
king
over
the
persians
after
himself
and
made
ready
to
march
but
in
the
year
after
the
revolt
of
egypt
darius
himself
died
nor
was
he
suffered
to
punish
the
athenians
or
the
egyptians
who
had
rebelled
against
him
the
death
of
darius
gave
greece
a
respite
but
the
final
conflict
was
only
postponed
xerxes
was
weak
obstinate
and
but
he
inherited
all
his
father
hatred
of
the
greeks
and
he
resolved
upon
one
supreme
effort
to
reduce
them
to
subjection
for
seven
years
more
the
whole
vast
persian
empire
resounded
with
the
notes
of
preparation
in
ten
years
after
the
battle
of
marathon
everything
was
in
readiness
a
formidable
fleet
had
been
built
and
equipped
corn
and
military
stores
had
been
collected
to
a
vast
amount
and
an
army
had
gathered
which
including
camp
followers
was
variously
estimated
at
from
three
to
five
millions
a
bridge
of
boats
was
built
across
the
hellespont
and
the
oriental
horde
was
prepared
to
ravage
the
grecian
valleys
like
a
swarm
of
devouring
locusts
a
great
storm
arose
and
destroyed
the
bridge
and
the
persian
despot
ordered
the
hellespont
scourged
with
whips
in
token
of
his
displeasure
when
the
bridge
was
rebuilt
xerxes
from
a
throne
erected
upon
the
shore
for
seven
days
and
nights
watched
his
mighty
host
pass
over
from
asia
into
europe
in
the
mean
time
the
greeks
were
preparing
for
the
onset
sparta
true
to
her
military
organization
did
little
but
to
bring
her
army
to
the
perfection
of
discipline
and
many
of
the
weaker
cities
resolved
to
quietly
submit
to
the
invaders
the
athenians
alone
seemed
to
have
fully
understood
the
gravity
of
the
situation
to
them
the
rage
of
the
persian
king
was
particularly
directed
for
the
crushing
defeat
at
marathon
and
athens
was
more
exposed
than
any
other
of
the
greek
cities
during
the
ten
years
athens
raised
and
equipped
as
large
an
army
as
her
population
would
warrant
every
man
was
enrolled
in
the
ranks
food
and
military
stores
were
collected
but
the
chief
means
of
defense
was
a
novel
one
and
showed
the
desperate
nature
of
the
conflict
in
which
they
were
about
to
engage
under
the
wise
direction
of
themistocles
they
built
a
formidable
fleet
so
large
that
in
case
of
emergency
the
whole
population
of
the
city
could
embark
and
either
remain
afloat
or
take
refuge
on
the
neighboring
islands
a
congress
of
the
cities
had
determined
to
oppose
the
approach
of
xerxes
at
some
favorable
place
by
a
combined
army
at
the
head
of
the
maliac
gulf
there
was
a
narrow
pass
through
which
the
persians
had
to
go
the
road
running
between
a
mountain
and
a
swamp
which
stretched
to
the
sea
and
at
one
place
the
swamp
came
so
near
the
mountain
that
there
was
hardly
room
for
the
road
to
run
between
this
is
the
famous
pass
of
thermopylæ
and
here
it
was
that
a
small
army
might
block
the
way
against
any
number
of
the
enemy
across
this
pass
a
wall
was
built
and
behind
it
was
posted
the
greek
army
under
the
command
of
leonidas
the
spartan
king
his
forces
consisted
of
three
hundred
spartans
seven
hundred
thespians
and
about
four
thousand
more
from
the
various
grecian
cities
the
persians
approached
and
for
four
days
waited
expecting
to
see
the
greek
army
disperse
at
the
very
sight
of
their
formidable
numbers
but
as
they
were
apparently
not
frightened
on
the
fifth
day
the
persians
made
an
attack
for
two
days
the
battle
continued
inflicting
great
losses
upon
the
persians
while
the
little
army
of
leonidas
behind
their
fortifications
was
scarcely
injured
on
the
third
morning
a
renegade
greek
showed
xerxes
a
path
across
the
mountains
where
he
could
completely
turn
the
greek
position
the
persians
were
not
slow
to
avail
themselves
of
this
intelligence
and
toward
the
close
of
the
third
day
leonidas
saw
the
enemy
descending
the
mountain
ready
to
surround
him
and
cut
off
his
retreat
acting
promptly
he
ordered
his
allies
to
leave
the
field
before
it
was
too
late
but
he
with
his
devoted
band
of
three
hundred
were
to
remain
in
accordance
of
a
spartan
law
which
forbade
a
spartan
soldier
ever
to
retreat
from
the
presence
of
an
enemy
the
seven
hundred
thespians
remained
with
him
and
the
whole
band
was
cut
down
but
not
without
inflicting
fearful
loss
upon
the
enemy

into

during

battle
the
fleets
were
also
engaged
in
an
indecisive

a

however
arose
and
destroyed
two
hundred
of
the
persian

when
thermopylæ

was

for

now
at
the
mercy
of
the
conqueror
the
spartan
army
moved
off
to
defend
their
own
city
it
was
now
that
the
wisdom
of
themistocles
showed
itself
the
athenians
had
no
hope
of
being
able
to
defend
athens
and
resolved
to
abandon
the
town
and
to
remove
their
wives
and
children
out
of
attica
to
a
place
of
safety
the
whole
population
men
women
and
children
sorrowfully
left
their
homes
and
streamed
down
to
the
carrying
what
they
could
with
them
the
fleet
took
them
over
to
salamis
and
adjacent
islands
and
when
xerxes
reached
athens
he
found
it
silent
and
deserted
a
few
poor
or
desperate
men
alone
refused
to
depart
and
had
posted
themselves
behind
a
wooden
fortification
on
the
top
of
the
acropolis
the
fortress
and
sanctuary
of
athens
the
persians
fired
the
fortifications
stormed
the
acropolis
slaughtered
its
defenders
and
burned
every
holy
place

athens
and
its
citadel
were
in
the
hands
of
the
barbarians
its
inhabitants
were
scattered
its
holy
places
destroyed
one
hope
alone
remained
to
the
athenians
the
ships
which
themistocles
had
persuaded
them
to
build
the
fleet
was
anchored
in
the
strait
of
salamis
and
beside
the
two
hundred
ships
of
athens
it
consisted
of
a
large
number
from
other
ports
of
greece
among
the
greeks
there
were
divided
counsels
some
were
for
giving
immediate
battle
and
some
were
for
flying
from
the
thousand
persian
ships
now
advancing
upon
them
themistocles
saw
that
to
retreat
would
be
ruin
and
he
by
stratagem
kept
every
ship
in
its
place
he
sent
secret
word
to
the
persians
that
the
greek
fleet
would
soon
be
in
full
retreat
and
the
persian
admiral
sent
two
hundred
vessels
to
blockade
the
farther
extremity
of
the
strait
so
that
flight
was
impossible

xerxes
from
a
throne
built
for
him
on
the
shore
so
that
he
might
be
a
spectator
of
the

gave
the

at

all
the
long
banks
of
oars
in
the
thousand
ships
flashed
in

and
dipped
in

water
but
here
as
at
marathon
the
way
was
narrow
and
there
was
no
chance
for
the
display
of
the
full
power
of
the
persian
fleet
in
a
conflict
they
stood
no
chance
with
the
greeks
and
xerxes
with
despair
in
his
heart
saw
two
hundred
of
his
best
ships
sunk
or
captured
and
many
more
seriously
disabled
while
the
greeks
had
suffered
little
loss
themistocles
remained
all
night
at

anchorage
ready
to
renew
the
conflict
on
the
morrow
but
xerxes
fearful
for
the
fate
of
his
bridge
across
the
hellespont
ordered
the
eight
hundred
remaining
ships
to
sail
for
its
protection
while
he
and
his
whole
army
marched
as
rapidly
as
possible
for
the
same
point
the
number
assembled
to
pass
back
into
asia
was
greatly
diminished
from
the
hosts
which
a
few
months
before
had
so
proudly
marched
to
assured
victory
besides
those
lost
in
battle
thousands
had
perished
through
disease
and
famine
but
the
hope
of
final
success
was
not
entirely
abandoned
and
the
persian
general
mardonius
with
three
hundred
thousand
of
the
best
soldiers
of
the
invading
army
were
left
to
complete
the
conquest
with
the
retreat
of
xerxes
the
athenians
returned
to
their
city
finding
their
temples
destroyed
and
their
homes
desolated
but
they
immediately
commenced
the
work
of
rebuilding
and
amid
rejoicings
and
renewed
hopes
the
city
arose
from
its
ashes
the
clash
of
arms
gave
place
to
the
din
of
industry
and
the
fighting
soldier
was
replaced
by
the
peaceable
citizen
in
the
mean
time
mardonius
went
into
winter
quarters
in
the
northern
provinces
and
during
the
winter
he
endeavored
to
effect
by
negotiation
and
bribery
what
he
had
failed
to
accomplish
by
arms
he
succeeded
in
exciting
the
jealousy
of
several
of
the
cities
toward
each
other
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
bring
about
concert
of
action
and
he
succeeded
in
detaching
thebes
entirely
from
the
confederacy
and
arraying
it
against
athens
the
theban
force
which
joined
his
army
became
one
of
the
most
formidable
foes
which
the
allied
greek
had
to
meet
the
negotiations
continued
through
the
spring
but
as
summer
approached
the
army
of
mardonius
was
on
the
move
sparta
was
not
ready
to
meet
the
invader
and
the
athenians
once
more
took
refuge
on
their
ships
ten
months
after
their
return
mardonius
took
possession
of
the
city
and
this
time
effectually
destroyed
it
but
as
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
a
further
stay
he
marched
his
army
to
thebes
which
became
his
headquarters
the
spartans
were
at
length
ready
to
march
they
saw
their
city
menaced
and
their
own
safety
demanded
that
the
forces
of
mardonius
should
be
broken
with
the
aid
of
their
allies
they
put
into
the
field
an
army
the
largest
that
the
greeks
ever
mustered
variously
reported
as
numbering
one
hundred
thousand
to
one
hundred
and
ten
thousand
men
these
were
under
the
command
of
the
spartan
king
pausanias
in
september
they
set
out
for
thebes
and
in
a
few
days
came
up
to
the
persian
army
which
was
stationed
at
plataea
a
short
distance
from
thebes
here
mardonius
had
established
a
fortified
camp
to
which
he
might
retreat
if
defeated
on
the
field
for
eleven
days
the
two
armies
confronted
each
other
neither
anxious
to
strike
the
first
blow
then
the
supply
of
water
for
the
greek
camp
gave
out
and
pausanias
fell
back
to
a
better
position
this
movement
threw
the
greek
army
into
disorder
and
the
three
main
divisions
became
separated
from
one
another
perceiving
this
the
next
morning
mardonius
hastened
with
his
persians
toward
the
higher
ground
where
the
spartan
troops
might
be
seen
winding
along
under
the
hillside
for
from
the
he
could
not
catch
sight
of
the
athenians
who
were
hidden
among
the
low
hills
which
rose
from
the
level
plain
the
last
momentous
strife
had
now
begun
it
was
the
custom
of
the
spartans
before
beginning
a
battle
to
offer
sacrifice
and
to
wait
for
an
omen
or
sign
from
heaven
on
the
offering
even
now
when
the
persians
had
advanced
to
within
and
were
pouring
flights
of
arrows
upon
the
spartans
pausanias
offered
sacrifice
but
the
omens
were
bad
and
forbade
any
action
except
in
the
spartans
knelt
behind
their
shields
but
the
arrows
pierced
them
and
the
bravest
men
died
sorrowfully
lamenting
not
for
death
but
because
they
died
without
striking
a
blow
for
sparta
in
his
distress
pausanias
called
upon
the
goddess
hera
and
the
omens
suddenly
became
favorable
and
the
spartans
with
their
tegean
allies
threw
themselves
upon
the
enemy
but
the
disparity
of
forces
rendered
the
attack
desperate
thousand
greeks
in
all
were
opposed
to
the
overwhelming
numbers
of
mardonius
the
athenians
were
engaged
elsewhere
and
could
afford
no
assistance
the
persians
had
made
a
palisade
of
their
wicker
shields
behind
which
they
could
securely
and
effectually
use
their
bows
and
arrows
by
the
first
fierce
onset
of
the
greeks
this
palisade
went
down
but
the
asiatics
laying
aside
their
bows
fought
desperately
with
javelins
and
daggers
but
they
had
no
metal
armor
to
defend
them
and
the
spartans
with
their
lances
fixed
and
their
shields
touching
each
other
bore
down
everything
before
them
the
persians
fought
with
almost
hellenic
heroism
coming
to
close
quarters
they
seized
the
spears
of
their
enemies
and
broke
off
their
heads
rushing
forward
singly
or
in
small
groups
they
were
borne
down
in
the
crush
and
killed
still
they
were
not
dismayed
and
the
battle
raged
more
fiercely
on
the
spot
where
mardonius
on
his
white
horse
fought
with
the
flower
of
his
troops
at
length
mardonius
was
slain
and
when
his
chosen
guards
had
fallen
around
him
the
remainder
of
the
persians
made
their
way
to
their
fortified
camp
and
took
refuge
behind
its
wooden
walls
in
the
mean
time
the
athenian
army
had
been
confronted
by
the
allies
here
it
was
not
a
conflict
between
disciplined
valor
and
barbaric
hordes
but
between
greek
and
greek
the
battle
was
long
and
bloody
but
in
the
end
the
defenders
of
greek
liberty
were
victorious
over
those
who
would
destroy
it
the
theban
force
was
not
only
defeated
but
annihilated
and
then
the
athenians
hastened
to
the
support
of
pansanias
while
the
spartans
were
the
soldiery
in
greece
for
the
field
they
had
little
skill
in
siege
operations
and
the
wooden
walls
of
the
persian
camp
opposed
to
them
an
effective
barrier
while
the
spartan
force
was
engaged
in
abortive
attempts
the
athenians
and
their
allies
came
up
fresh
from
their
victory
over
the
thebans
headed
by
the
tegeans
they
burst
like
a
deluge
into
the
encampment
and
the
persians
losing
all
heart
sought
wildly
to
hide
themselves
like
deer
flying
from
lions
then
followed
a
carnage
so
fearful
that
out
of
two
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
men
not
three
thousand
it
is
said
remained
alive
thus
ended
this
formidable
invasion
which
threatened
the
very
existence
of
greece
the
great
wave
of
oriental
despotism
had
spent
its
force
without
submerging
freedom
thenceforth
the
wonderful
greek
energy
and
creative
power
might
be
turned
away
from
matters
military
and
expended
upon
the
arts
of
peace
the
athenians
returned
to
their
city
and
found
everything
in
ruins
fire
and
hate
had
destroyed
home
and
temple
alike
all
the
accumulated
wealth
of
generations
was
gone
nothing
was
left
but
the
indomitable
energy
which
had
been
tested
on
so
many
trying
emergencies
and
the
wonderful
skill
of
eye
and
hand
which
came
of
inherited
aptitude
and
long
personal
experience
upon
the
old
site
a
new
city
grew
in
a
single
generation
marvelous
in
its
splendor
of
temple
and

light
and
airy
yet
so
strong

enduring

became
objects
of
interest
to
all

crowds
of
pilgrims
visited
the
localities
celebrated
by
the
evangelists
splendid
churches
were
erected
on
the
ruins
of

spot
pointed

life

his
apostles

marked
by

chapel
or

of
prayer
jerusalem
and
the
holy
land
became
the
resort
of
numerous
bodies
of
clergy
who
resided
in
the
churches
and
monasteries
which
the
piety
of
the
wealthy
had
founded
for
them
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
century
the
gigantic
roman
empire
was
broken
up
into
two
the
eastern
the
capital
of
which
was
constantinople
and
the
western
the
capital
of
which
was
rome
it
was
to
the
former
of
these
that
syria
and
palestine
were
attached
before
the
end
of
the
fifth
century
the
western
empire
had
been
destroyed
by
the
eruption
of
the
german
races
and
the
beginnings
of
a
new
european
civilization
were
rising
from
its
ruins
meanwhile
the
eastern
remained
entire
till
about
the
year
when
the
arabs
burning
with
the
spirit
of
conquest
infused
into
them
by
the
religion
of
mohammed
poured
into
its
provinces
egypt
syria
and
palestine
were
annexed
as
dependencies
to
the
great
arabic
empire
of
the
caliphs
the
religion
of
mohammed
became
dominant
in
the
holy
land
the
temples
and
chapels
were
converted
into
mosques
numbers
of
pilgrims
still
continued
each
year
to
visit
palestine
in
return
for
a
certain
tribute
the
earlier
caliphs
permitted
the
christians
of
jerusalem
to
have
a
patriarch
and
to
carry
on
their
own
form
of
worship
of
all
the
caliphs
the
celebrated
haroun
best
known
to
us
in
the
stories
of
the
arabian
nights
was
the
most
tolerant
and
under
him
the
christians
enjoyed
perfect
peace
great
cruelties
were
practised
by
the
fatimite
caliphs
who
conquered
syria
about
the
year
the
pilgrims
were
robbed
beaten
and
sometimes
slain
on
their
journey
the
christian
residents
oppressed
by
heavy
impositions
and
their
feelings
outraged
by
insults
against
their
religion
these
sufferings
were
slight
however
compared
with
those
which
they
endured
after
the
invasion
and
conquest
of
palestine
by
the
turkish
hordes
in
but
recently
converted
to
moslemism
and
therefore
more
rude
and
fanatical
than
the
other
mohammedans
these
turks
wreaked
their
vengeance
on
all
alike
christians
jews
and
even
the
native
mohammedans
the
news
of
the
atrocities
perpetrated
by
the
turks
produced
a
deep
sensation
over
the
whole
of
christendom
as
well
among
the
latin
christians
as
among
the
greek
christians
the
name
given
to
the
population
of
what
remained
of
the
old
byzantine
empire
the
latter
had
reason
to
dread
that
if
the
turks
were
not
checked
constantinople
their
capital
would
soon
share
the
same
fate
as
jerusalem
accordingly
about
the
year
the
greek
emperor
manuel
vii
sent
to
supplicate
the
assistance
of
the
great
pope
gregory
vii
against
the
turks
till
now
there
had
prevailed
a
spirit
of
antagonism
between
the
greek
and
latin
churches
the
former
refusing
to
yield
obedience
to
the
pope
of
the
west
as
the
universal
head
of
the
church
gregory
therefore
eagerly
received
the
application
of
the
greek
emperor
seeing
the
promise
of
the
final
subjection
of
the
greek
to
the
latin
church
he
resolved
to
give
the
enterprise
his
countenance
and
to
march
himself
at
the
head
of
an
army
to
rescue
the
holy
sepulchre
gregory
was
prevented
from
ever
carrying
out
his
design
and
the
idea
of
a
crusade
gradually
died
away
meanwhile
the
turks
extended
their
victories
at
the
expense
of
the
greek
empire
before
the
accession
of
the
celebrated
alexius
comnenus
to
the
throne
in
the
whole
of
asia
minor
was
in
the
possession
of
the
turks
and
broken
up
into
a
number
of
kingdoms
the
sultans
of
which
soon
began
to
quarrel
among
themselves
the
disturbed
state
of
asia
minor
greatly
increased
the
sufferings
of
the
pilgrims
not
one
out
of
three
returned
to
recount
the
story
of
his
hardships
among
those
who
undertook
the
pilgrimage
to
jerusalem
when
the
dangers
attending
it
were
the
greatest
was
a
native
of
amiens
in
france
named
peter
who
had
become
a
monk
and
an
ascetic
being
called
from
his
solitary
manner
of
life
peter
the
hermit
he
arrived
safely
at
jerusalem
and
visited
all
the
scenes
sacred
to
a
christian
eyes
as
he
walked
along
the
streets
looking
at
this
and
that
holy
spot
insolent
and
contemptuous
turks
looked
on
and
mocked
him
and
his
spirit
grew
bitter
within
him
and
his
hand
clutched
itself
convulsively
as
if
longing
for
a
sword
burning
with
a
sense
of
injuries
sustained
by
the
christians
and
the
desecration
of
the
sacred
places
he
sought
the
counsel
of
simeon
the
greek
patriarch
of
jerusalem
in
reply
to
peter
questions
he
explained
that
nothing
was
to
be
expected
from
the
greek
empire
in
behalf
of
the
holy
land
the
court
of
constantinople
was
so
dissolute
and
corrupt
and
that
the
only
hope
was
that
the
latin
princes
might
be
persuaded
to
form
a
league
for
the
grand
purpose

illustration

the
letters
were
accordingly
written
and
the
hermit
set
sail
with
them
from
joppa
arriving
in
italy
he
presented
the
documents
to
the
pope
urban

a
pupil
and

urging
his
holiness
to
use
his
authority
as
the
head
of
christendom
to
set
in
motion
a
scheme
for
regaining
the
birthplace
of
christ
enthusiasm
is
contagious
and
the
pope
appears
to
have
caught
it
instantly
from
one
whose
zeal
was
so
unbounded
giving
the
hermit
full
powers
he
sent
him
abroad
to
preach
the
holy
war
peter
departed
going
from
town
to
town
and
from
village
to
village
and
in
the
language
of
the
chroniclers
traversing
the
whole
of
europe
in
less
than
a
time
his
strange
and
wild
aspect
his
glittering
eye
his
shrill
and
unearthly
eloquence
the
grandeur
of
his
theme
his
pathetic
descriptions
of
jerusalem
and
the
christians
there
produced
everywhere
the
most
extraordinary
sensations
he
set
out
says
a
contemporary
historian
from
whence
i
know
not
nor
with
what
purpose
but
we
saw
him
passing
through
the
towns
and
villages
everywhere
preaching
and
the
people
flocking
round
him
loading
him
with
gifts
and
praising
his
sanctity
with
such
eulogiums
that
i
never
remember
having
seen
so
great
honors
paid
to
any
other
man
the
people
reverenced
him
so
that
they
plucked
the
hairs
from
the
mane
of
his
mule
and
kept
them
afterward
as
relics
out
of
doors
he
generally
wore
a
woolen
tunic
with
a
brown
mantle
which
descended
to
his
heels
his
arms
and
feet
were
bare
he
ate
little
or
no
bread
but
lived
on
fish
and
wine
such
being
the
success
of
the
hermit
mission
the
pope
showed
his
approbation
of
the
project
by
summoning
in
the
year
two
councils
the
first
of
these
was
held
at
placentia
in
march
ambassadors
from
the
greek
emperor
appeared
to
petition
for
aid
against
the
turks
and
the
members
of
the
council
were
unanimous
in
their
support
of
the
crusade
the
second
the
famous
council
of
clermont
was
held
at
the
town
of
that
name
in
auvergne
in
the
month
of
november
it
was
in
the
midst
of
an
extremely
cold
winter
and
the
ground
was
covered
with
snow
during
seven
days
the
council
sat
with
closed
doors
while
immense
crowds
from
all
parts
of
france
flocked
into
the
town
in
the
expectation
that
the
pope
himself
would
address
the
people
all
the
neighborhood
presented
the
appearance
of
a
vast
camp
issuing
from
the
church
in
his
full
canonicals
surrounded
by
his
cardinals
and
bishops
in
all
the
splendor
of
ecclesiastical
costume
the
pope
stood
before
the
populace
on
a
high
scaffolding
erected
for
the
occasion
and
covered
with
scarlet
cloth
a
brilliant
array
of
bishops
and
cardinals
surrounded
him
and
among
them
humbler
in
rank
but
more
important
in
the
world
eye
the
hermit
peter
dressed
in
his
simple
woolen
gown
the
pope
eloquent
words
touched
every
heart
he
was
interrupted
by
the
united
voice
of
the
people
shouting
god
wills
it
god
wills
it
hushing
the
joyous
tumult
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
the
pontiff
continued
be
they
then
your
in
the
combat
for
those
words
came
from
god
let
the
army
of
the
lord
when
it
rushes
upon
its
enemies
shout
but
that
one
cry
wills
it
god
wills
it
let
whoever
is
inclined
to
devote
himself
to
this
holy
cause
wear
on
his
breast
or
back
the
sign
of
the
holy
cross
from
this
time
the
red
cross
was
the
sacred
emblem
of
the
crusaders
the
first
crusade
following
the
council
of
clermont
preparations
for
invading
the
holy
land
began
in
almost
every
country
of
europe
the
clanging
of
the
smith
hammer
making
or
repairing
armor
was
heard
in
every
village
all
who
had
property
of
any
description
rushed
to
the
mart
to
change
it
for
hard
cash
the
nobles
mortgaged
their
estates
the
farmer
endeavored
to
sell
his
plow
and
the
artisan
his
tools
to
purchase
a
sword
for
the
deliverance
of
jerusalem
women
disposed
of
their
trinkets
for
the
same
purpose
during
the
spring
and
summer
of
the
roads
teemed
with
crusaders
all
hastening
to
the
towns
and
villages
appointed
as
the
rendevous
of
the
district
very
few
knew
where
jerusalem
was
some
thought
it
fifty
thousand
miles
away
and
others
imagined
it
but
a
month
journey
while
at
the
sight
of
every
tower
or
castle
the
children
exclaimed
is
that
jerusalem
little
attempt
at
any
organization
was
made
though
the
multitude
had
three
leaders
it
is
said
that
the
first
band
consisting
of
twenty
thousand
foot
with
only
eight
horsemen
were
led
by
a
burgundian
gentleman
called
walter
the
penniless
they
were
followed
by
a
rabble
of
forty
thousand
men
women
and
children
led
by
peter
the
hermit
a
medley
of
all
nations
and
languages
next
followed
a
band
of
fifteen
thousand
men
mostly
germans
under
a
priest
named
gottschalk
these
three
multitudes
led
the
way
in
the
crusades
pursuing
the
same
route
that
namely
which
leads
through
hungary
and
bulgaria
toward
asia
minor
like
their
nominal
leader
each
of
the
followers
of
walter
the
penniless
was
poor
to
penury
and
trusted
for
subsistence
to
the
chances
of
the
road
in
hungary
they
met
with
loud
resistance
from
the
people
whose
houses
they
attacked
and
plundered
but
in
bulgaria
the
natives
declared
war
against
the
hungry
horde
they
were
dispersed
and
almost
exterminated
some
of
the
survivors
retraced
their
steps
the
rest
among
whom
was
walter
reached
constantinople
where
they
awaited
the
arrival
of
peter
and
his
companions
the
hermit
who
had
the
same
difficulties
to
contend
with
in
marching
through
hungary
and
bulgaria
reached
constantinople
with
his
army
greatly
reduced
and
in
a
most
deplorable
condition
here
he
and
walter
joined
forces
the
hermit
assuming
the
superior
command
they
were
hospitably
received
by
the
emperor
but
their
riotous
conduct
soon
wearied
out
his
patience
and
he
was
glad
to
listen
to
a
proposal
of
the
hermit
to
furnish
them
with
the
means
of
passing
at
once
into
asia
the
rabble
accordingly
crossed
the
bosphorus
and
took
up
their
quarters
in
bethynia
here
they
became
perfectly
ungovernable
ravaging
the
country
around
and
committing
incredible
excesses
at
length
peter
utterly
disgusted
and
despairing
left
them
to
their
own
guidance
and
returned
to
constantinople
the
bravest
of
them
were
annihilated
in
a
battle
fought
near
nice
walter
the
penniless
falling
with
seven
mortal
wounds
between
two
and
three
thousand
alone
escaped
brought
back
to
constantinople
by
the
troops
of
alexius
who
rescued
them
from
the
turks
the
emperor
dismissed
them
with
orders
to
return
home
and
thus
ended
the
disastrous
expedition
of
walter
the
penniless
and
peter
the
hermit
the
fifteen
thousand
germans
led
by
gottschalk
never
reached
constantinople
being
slaughtered
or
dispersed
during
their
passage
through
hungary
hungary
was
also
fatal
to
another
army
of
crusaders
the
fourth
in
order
but
greatly
exceeding
in
numbers
the
other
three
put
together
this
terrible
horde
consisting
of
about
two
hundred
thousand
swept
through
germany
committing
horrible
outrages
especially
against
the
jews
whom
they
murdered
without
mercy
they
were
preceded
by
a
goose
and
a
goat
to
which
they
attributed
divine
powers
as
the
rabble
advanced
the
hungarians
gave
themselves
up
for
lost
the
king
and
nobles
were
preparing
to
flee
when
the
mass
fell
asunder
of
its
own
accord
many
were
slain
by
the
enraged
hungarians
some
escaped
to
the
north
a
few
ultimately
joined
the
succeeding
bands
of
crusaders
but
the
majority
perished
thus
within
a
few
months
upward
of
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
human
beings
were
swept
out
of
existence
and
they
had
spent
their
lives
without
one
important
result
having
been
accomplished
without
one
glorious
feat
having
been
achieved
this
was
the
worst
paroxysm
of
the
madness
of
europe
and
this
passed
her
chivalry
stepped
upon
the
scene
men
of
cool
heads
mature
plans
and
invincible
courage
stood
forward
to
lead
and
direct
not
more
fanatical
masses
but
the
gentry
yeomanry
and
serfs
of
feudal
europe
these
were
the
true
crusaders
altogether
they
formed
six
armies
marching
separately
and
at
considerable
intervals
of
time
first
carne
the
army
of
godfrey
of
bouillon
duke
of
lorraine
the
pride
of
his
age
for
all
noble
and
knightly
virtues
immortalized
by
the
poet
tasso
he
had
risen
from
a
to
join
the
crusade
and
sold
his
lordship
to
raise
the
necessary
money
around
his
standard
assembled
many
of
the
best
knights
of
the
age
in
the
month
of
august
they
commenced
their
march
through
hungary
and
bulgaria
four
other
chiefs
of
the
royal
blood
of
europe
also
assumed
the
cross
and
led
each
his
army
to
the
holy
land
hugh
count
of
vermandois
brother
of

eldest
son
of
the
celebrated
robert

with
bohemond
and
second
in
command
in
the
army
came
tancred
the
favorite
hero
of
all
the
historians
of
the
crusade
so
young
so
valiant
so
enthusiastic
there
was
not
among
them
all
says
tasso
a
greater
warrior
nor
any
one
of
more
courteous
behavior
of
fairer
countenance
or
of
loftier
and
more
intrepid
heart
the
last
army
was
led
by
the
haughty
and
resolute
count
raimond
of
toulouse
to
detail
the
progress
of
the
various
armies
is
unnecessary
upward
of
six
hundred
thousand
warriors
of
the
west
beside
a
multitude
of
priests
women
and
children
were
at
last
actually
encamped
on
asiatic
soil
it
was
literally
a
moving
nation
in
which
all
languages
were
spoken
all
costumes
worn
there
was
the
son
of
the
north
with
broad
open
forehead
mild
blue
eyes
sanguine
complexion
and
large
frame
there
the
dark
visaged
southron
with
his
flashing
glance
and
fiery
soul
there
was
the
knight
in
his
armor
the
priest
in
his
robes
the
in
his
tough
jerkin
the
unkempt
serf
with
his
belt
of
rope
there
were
pawing
horses
swearing
grooms
carts
full
of
provisions
sacks
groups
of
gossiping
women
crowds
of
merry
children
under
the
bright
sun
of
asia
all
was
gaudy
and
brilliant
spearpoints
glittered
and
helmets
gleamed
thousands
of
targets
displayed
their
painted
glories
pennons
of
blue
purple
and
white
streamed
from
every
tent
while
heavier
flags
flapped
their
sullen
folds
and
everywhere
on
shield
flag
helmet
tunic
and
coat
of
mail
was
seen
blazoned
the
holy
sign
of
the
red
cross
walking
through
all
these
heedless
of
the
looks
cast
upon
him
and
hearing
not
the
from
all
parts
of
the
camp
might
be
seen
a
man
of
small
stature
thin
and
poorly
clad
with
face
wild
unsettled
eye
and
timid
nervous
gait
it
was
the
man
who
had
created
it
all
peter
the
hermit
he
had
crossed
from
constantinople
with
godfrey
of
bouillon
his
revenge
was
near
on
on
then
to
the
holy
city
alas
the
holy
city
was
yet
far
distant
not
much
more
than
half
their
journey
in
point
of
space
had
been
accomplished
and
in
point
of
difficulty
and
peril
their
march
had
little
more
than
begun
for
they
had
just
entered
the
countries
of
the
infidels
months
had
to
roll
on
and
many
battles
to
be
fought
ere
the
pinnacles
of
the
holy
city
should
greet
their
longing
eyes
the
route
of
the
crusading
armies
lay
in
a
southeasterly
direction
through
asia
minor
and
then
southward
to
jerusalem
along
the
shores
of
the
levant
their
march
along
this
route
counting
from
the
time
of
their
crossing
into
asia
minor
may
to
the
time
when
they
came
in
sight
of
jerusalem
and
laid
siege
to
it
june
occupied
upward
of
two
years
countless
were
the
dangers
to
which
the
crusaders
were
subject
in
this
trial
of
the
many
sieges
two
are
especially
memorable
that
of
nice
and
that
of
antioch
the
siege
of
nice
was
the
first
exploit
in
which
the
crusading
armies
were
engaged
during
these
six
weeks
the
slaughter
of
the
christians
by
the
arrows
of
the
turkish
garrison
and
by
the
bolts
and
large
stones
which
they
discharged
from
mangonels
and
catapults
was
immense
the
city
surrendered
at
last
not
however
to
the
latin
chiefs
but
to
an
envoy
of
the
greek
emperor
alexius
who
contrived
to
enter
into
communication
with
the
besieged
and
induced
them
to
capitulate
angry
and
dissatisfied
the
crusaders
left
their
encampment
and
resumed
their
march
not
in
one
mass
but
in
several
bodies
at
length
the
scattered
armies
reunited
for
the
siege
of
antioch
toward
the
end
of
october
all
the
known
means
of
attack
were
put
in
operation
movable
towers
were
constructed
from
which
to
discharge
missiles
into
the
city
the
walls
were
battered
and
the
sallies
of
the
besieged
bravely
met
still
without
any
effective
result
at
the
end
of
ten
days
famine
stared
them
in
the
face
so
extravagant
were
they
in
the
use
of
their
stores
pestilence
joined
its
ravages
and
instead
of
the
brave
army
of
chivalry
which
had
sat
down
before
antioch
was
to
be
seen
a
crowd
of
gaunt
and
famishing
creatures
with
scarcely
a
thought
but
that
of
procuring
food
multitudes
died
desertions
became
numerous
the
chiefs
began
to
weary
of
the
expedition
and
most
disgraceful
of
all
peter
the
hermit
turned
his
back
on
the
enterprise
and
had
actually
fled
several
miles
on
his
way
home
when
he
was
brought
back
by
the
soldiers
of
tancred
and
forced
to
undergo
a
public
reprimand
at
length
after
infinite
sufferings
on
the
part
of
the
christians
antioch
was
taken
on
the
of
june
by
means
of
the
treachery
of
an
armenian
captain
whom
the
turks
had
intrusted
with
the
command
of
one
of
the
towers
and
who
admitted
a
number
of
the
crusaders
during
a
dark
and
stormy
night
imagination
can
not
conceive
a
scene
more
dreadful
than
that
presented
by
the
devoted
city
of
antioch
on
that
night
of
horror
the
crusaders
fought
with
a
blind
fury
which
fanaticism
and
suffering
alike
incited
no
quarter
was
shown
at
daylight
the
massacre
ceased
and
the
crusaders
gave
themselves
up
to
plunder
they
found
gold
jewels
and
rich
fabrics
in
abundance
but
of
provisions
little
of
any
kind
suddenly
they
were
roused
from
their
sloth
and
pleasure
by
the
appearance
before
antioch
of
an
immense
army
which
the
persian
caliph
had
dispatched
to
sweep
the
christian
locusts
from
the
face
of
the
earth
great
was
the
alarm
of
the
christians
when
they
saw
this
splendid
host
of
more
than
two
hundred
thousand
men
encamped
around
the
hills
of
antioch
the
corn
and
wine
found
in
the
city
were
soon
exhausted
all
the
horrors
of
a
second
famine
began
many
deserted
and
escaped
over
the
walls
carrying
the
news
of
the
sad
condition
of
the
christians
back
toward
europe
the
worst
consequence
of
these
desertions
was
that
the
greek
emperor
alexius
who
hearing
of
the
successes
of
the
latins
was
on
his
march
to
assist
the
crusaders
was
deterred
from
advancing
and
returned
to
constantinople
with
increasing
famine
came
a
pestilence
so
that
in
a
short
time
but
sixty
thousand
remained
of
the
three
hundred
thousand
that
had
invested
antioch
but
this
bitter
extremity
knit
the
leaders
more
firmly
together
and
bohemond
godfrey
and
tancred
swore
never
to
desert
the
cause
while
life
lasted
it
is
said
that
belief
in
the
remarkable
fulfillment
of
a
dream
brought
hope
once
more
to
the
disheartened
crusaders
peter
barthelmy
a
priest
of
provence
dreamed
he
said
that
saint
andrew
appeared
to
him
in
the
night
and
informed
him
that
underneath
a
certain
spot
in
the
floor
of
the
church
of
saint
peter
was
buried
the
identical
lance
with
which
the
roman
soldiers
pierced
the
side
of
christ
as
he
hung
on
the
cross
this
relic
said
the
apparition
was
to
be
the
guarantee
of
god
presence
and
their
guide
to
victory
twelve
persons
were
chosen
to
conduct
the
search
a
whole
day
was
spent
in
vain
the
workmen
were
tired
out
and
still
no
lance
was
found
at
last
peter
descended
into
the
pit
and
began
to
dig
the
loose
earth
suddenly
a
cry
of
joy
was
heard
and
stretching
himself
to
his
full
height
peter
handed
up
into
the
eager
fingers
of
those
above
an
actual
rusty
in
an
instant
it
was
noised
abroad
that
the
holy
relic
had
been
found
what
remained
now
but
to
issue
forth
and
discomfit
the
infidel
host
the
infidel
host
was
discomfited
on
the
of
june
two
hundred
thousand
turks
in
the
full
flush
of
health
and
strength
were
routed
outside
the
walls
of
antioch
by
a
christian
army
antioch
was
bestowed
upon
bohemond
and
it
was
resolved
that
the
army
should
remain
there
to
recruit
before
advancing
toward
jerusalem
the
tragical
fate
of
peter
barthelmy
must
be
mentioned
many
of
the
crusaders
had
begun
to
question
the
genuineness
of
the
relic
he
had
found
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
submit
to
the
ordeal
of
fire
and
perished
in
the
flames
from
that
moment
the
story
of
the
relic
lost
credit
it
was
on
a
lovely
morning
in
the
summer
of
that
the
forty
thousand
crusaders
who
were
all
that
remained
of
the
vast
army
which
had
two
years
ago
laid
seige
to
nice
were
recompensed
for
all
their
toils
by
a
sight
of
the
holy
city
bathed
in
the
splendor
of
eastern
sunshine
the
name
jerusalem
escaped
from
every
lip
some
leaped
and
shouted
some
kneeled
and
prayed
some
wept
some
threw
themselves
prostrate
and
kissed
the
earth
some
gazed
and
trembled
all
had
much
ado
says
the
quaint
fuller
to
manage
so
much
gladness
preparations
for
a
siege
were
soon
under
way
the
besiegers
who
had
gained
skill
by
their
former
attempts
employed
all
the
methods
of
attack
that
experience
could
suggest
or
courage
execute
while
the
garrison
of
forty
thousand
turks
who
maintained
the
city
for
their
master
the
caliph
of
egypt
resisted
with
determined
obstinacy
at
length
after
a
confession
of
sins
by
the
whole
army
and
a
penitential
procession
around
the
walls
a
simultaneous
attack
was
made
with
mangonels
and
all
manner
of
besieging
engines
at
one
quarter
a
huge
wooden
tower
was
wheeled
close
to
the
walls
a
movable
bridge
was
let
down
and
bounding
across
it
a
soldier
named
lutold
was
the
first
man
to
stand
upon
the
battlements
godfrey
of
bouillon
and
a
number
of
knights
sprang
after
him
and
the
christians
were
within
jerusalem
meanwhile
at
another
part
of
the
wall
tancred
and
robert
of
normandy
had
shattered
open
a
gate
and
rushed
in
with
their
men
while
at
a
third
part
of
the
city
raimond
of
toulouse
effected
an
entrance
for
himself
and
his
followers
by
the
help
of
in
an
instant
after
the
banner
of
the
cross
floated
upon
the
walls
of
jerusalem
the
crusaders
raising
once
more
their
redoubtable
rushed
on
from
every
side
and
the
city
was
taken
the
battle
raged
for
several
hours
and
the
christians
gave
no
quarter
peter
the
hermit
who
had
remained
so
long
under
the
veil
of
neglect
was
repaid
that
day
for
all
his
zeal
and
all
his
suffering
he
was
once
more
the
idol
of
the
army
but
history
is
silent
concerning
the
remainder
of
his
life
eight
days
after
the
capture
of
the
city
the
latin
chiefs
unanimously
elected
godfrey
of
bouillon
king
of
jerusalem
a
new
christian
state
was
thus
founded
in
syria
consisting
at
first
of
little
more
than
the
mere
city
of
jerusalem
but
extending
by
subsequent
battles
and
conquests
until
it
included
the
whole
of
palestine
a
language
resembling
was
established
in
this
kingdom
and
a
code
of
feudal
laws
drawn
up
for
its
government
the
clergy
also
obtained
their
share
of
the
conquest
jerusalem
was
created
into
a
patriarchate
and
bethlehem
into
a
bishopric
the
foundation
of
the
latin
kingdom
of
jerusalem
in
july
was
the
consummation
of
the
first
crusade
a
period
of
fifty
years
succeeded
during
which
time
many
battles
were
fought
with
the
saracens
of
syria
and
egypt
the
result
of
which
was
to
strengthen
the
latin
state
no
fewer
than
five
hundred
thousand
persons
set
out
from
europe
for
syria
incited
by
the
news
of
the
success
of
the
first
crusade
the
three
centers
from
which
the
christian
power
sought
to
spread
itself
through
the
mussulman
possessions
were
jerusalem
antioch
and
edessa
the
very
spirit
of
the
crusade
seemed
to
have
died
out
the
latin
kingdom
of
jerusalem
had
become
like
any
other
kingdom
of
the
period
a
country
in
which
men
built
houses
plowed
land
made
bargains
gave
feasts
drank
laughed
talked
quarreled
and
went
to
law
the
fall
of
edessa
the
first
conspicuous
success
of
the
turks
came
like
a
surprise
upon
the
latin
population
of
syria
an
attempt
was
made
by
the
christians
to
recover
the
city
but
it
failed
and
the
frontier
of
syria
was
open
to
invasion
from
the
east
the
second
crusade
the
fall
of
edessa
and
the
petitions
of
the
people
of
palestine
for
aid
produced
a
sensation
throughout
europe
and
especially
in
france
nor
was
an
apostle
wanting
worthy
to
fill
the
place
of
peter
and
to
summon
the
chivalry
of
europe
to
a
second
crusade
commissioned
by
pope
eugenius
for
that
purpose
the
famous
saint
bernard
abbot
of
clairvaux
in
champagne
traveled
through
france
and
germany
exerting
the
power
of
his
marvelous
eloquence
in
recruiting
the
armies
of
the
cross
the
chiefs
of
the
second
crusade
were
two
of
the
most
powerful
princes
of
europe
louis
vii
king
of
france
and
conrad
iii
emperor
of
germany
under
their
command
upward
of
one
million
two
hundred
thousand
men
collected
from
all
parts
of
europe
marched
toward
palestine
in
two
great
armies
early
in
notwithstanding
the
vastness
of
the
preparations
the
expedition
was
a
total
failure
the
events
of
the
last
fifty
years
had
rendered
the
policy
of
the
greek
princes
hostile
to
the
crusades
manuel
comnenus
the
grandson
of
alexius
who
now
occupied
the
throne
suffered
both
armies
to
pass
into
asia
minor
where
misled
by
greek
scouts
the
army
of
conrad
was
all
but
destroyed
by
the
turks
near
iconium
while
the
army
of
louis
after
undergoing
infinite
hardships
was
wrecked
in
the
defiles
of
the
pisidian
mountains
the
fragments
of
the
two
armies
uniting
made
their
way
to
syria
where
they
with
forces
of
the
princes
of
jerusalem
and
antioch
in
laying
seige
to
damascus
but
without
effect
in
conrad
and
louis
returned
to
europe
and
the
second
crusade
was
at
an
end
having
attained
nothing
but
the
expenditure
of
more
than
a
million
of
lives
the
third
crusade
a
period
of
forty
years
elapsed
before
europe
fitted
out
another
crusade
meanwhile
the
struggle
between
the
christian
and
the
turks
in
syria
was
carried
on
without
intermission
noureddin
the
son
of
the
conqueror
of
edessa
displayed
a
genius
which
astonished
both
christians
and
turks
keeping
possession
of
edessa
he
aimed
at
extending
his
conquest
at
the
expense
of
the
christians
still
further
for
some
time
he
was
kept
in
check
by
the
abilities
of
baldwin
iii
king
of
jerusalem
on
his
death
in
his
brother
amalric
far
inferior
to
baldwin
in
ability
succeeded
to
the
throne
at
this
crisis
while
noureddin
the
sultan
of
aleppo
and
amalric
the
christian
king
of
jerusalem
were
the
rival
powers
in
syria
occurred
a
circumstance
which
exercised
considerable
influence
on
the
subsequent
course
of
events
and
which
makes
necessary
a
retrospective
glance
at
the
time
of
the
first
crusade
palestine
was
the
scene
of
a
violent
contest
between
the
turks
who
had
poured
down
from
the
north
conquering
as
they
went
and
the
fatimites
of
egypt
who
had
possessed
syria
for
nearly
a
century
the
turks
had
at
first
been
irresistible
the
fatimites
however
had
been
able
to
recover
jerusalem
from
the
hands
of
their
enemies
and
held
it
when
besieged
by
the
christians
interrupted
in
their
conflict
with
each
other
for
the
sovereignty
of
palestine
the
fatimites
and
turks
turned
their
arms
with
one
accord
against
the
invader
in
the
person
of
noureddin
the
turkish
power
was
now
increasing
the
fatimite
dynasty
of
egypt
meanwhile
had
long
been
showing
signs
of
decay
the
caliphs
having
become
mere
tools
in
the
hands
of
their
viziers
in
one
of
these
viziers
shawer
finding
himself
expelled
from
his
post
by
a
rival
sought
refuge
at
the
court
of
aleppo
and
applied
to
the
sultan
for
assistance
noureddin
eagerly
embraced
an
opportunity
for
obtaining
a
footing
in
egypt
and
sent
two
persons
chyrkouh
and
his
nephew
saladin
to
displace
the
usurping
vizier
and
shawer
they
however
usurped
the
government
and
shawer
applied
to
the
king
of
jerusalem
amalric
for
assistance
amalric
in
turn
attempted
usurpation
and
again
the
officers
of
noureddin
came
to
the
aid
of
shawer
the
vizier
paid
the
penalty
of
his
fickleness
by
losing
his
head
and
his
post
was
occupied
by
chyrkouh
who
while
ruling
egypt
as
a
vizier
of
the
fatimite
caliph
was
in
reality
the
lieutenant
of
noureddin
on
the
death
of
chyrkouh
saladin
was
appointed
to
the
viziership
the
caliph
fancied
that
he
would
now
regain
the
control
of
his
own
dominions
but
he
little
knew
the
character
of
his
new
vizier
saladin
soon
effected
a
revolution
in
egypt
declared
the
fatimite
dynasty
to
be
at
an
end
and
subjected
the
country
once
more
to
the
nominal
authority
of
the
bagdad
caliphs
whom
noureddin
professed
to
reverence
as
the
supreme
heads
of
the
mohammedan
empire
nor
did
he
stop
here
he
soon
showed
a
disposition
to
shake
off
the
supremacy
of
noureddin
and
the
sultan
of
aleppo
was
marching
into
egypt
to
vindicate
his
authority
when
he
suddenly
died
in
the
year
saladin
now
saw
the
great
obstacle
to
his
ambition
removed
and
began
to
aim
at
realizing
those
schemes
of
sovereignty
which
noureddin
had
projected
the
state
of
the
christian
kingdom
during
the
ten
or
twelve
years
which
followed
directly
favored
his
plans
civil
dissensions
arose
which
the
keen
eye
of
saladin
discovered
and
already
master
of
all
syria
he
resolved
to
complete
his
greatness
by
the
conquest
of
palestine
accordingly
when
in
the
year
it
was
known
that
he
was
on
his
march
against
jerusalem
the
christian
crusaders
saw
the
necessity
of
abandoning
their
dissensions
and
uniting
cordially
against
the
invader
town
after
town
surrendered
to
the
victorious
saracen
and
in
october
jerusalem
itself
after
fourteen
days
defense
was
obliged
to
submit
to
his
mercy
the
conduct
of
saladin
on
this
occasion
was
more
generous
than
might
have
been
expected
a
moderate
ransom
was
fixed
for
every
individual
on
the
payment
of
which
he
was
at
liberty
to
remove
with
his
goods
to
whatever
place
he
chose
to
the
christian
ladies
saladin
conduct
was
courteous
in
the
extreme
so
that
it
became
a
remark
among
the
latins
of
palestine
that
saladin
was
a
barbarian
only
in
name
thus
after
ninety
years
was
the
holy
city
again
inhabited
by
the
infidel
and
all
the
fruits
of
the
first
crusade
lost
as
it
seemed
to
the
world
saladin
now
possessed
the
whole
of
palestine
with
the
single
exception
of
the
city
of
tyre
which
was
gallantly
defended
by
conrad
marquis
of
montferrat
the
epidemic
frenzy
which
had
been
gradually
cooling
was
now
extinct
or
nearly
so
and
the
nations
of
europe
looked
with
cold
indifference
upon
the
armaments
of
their
princes
but
chivalry
was
now
in
all
its
glory
and
it
continued
to
supply
armies
for
the
holy
land
poetry
more
than
religion
inspired
the
third
crusade
the
knights
and
their
retainers
listened
with
delight
to
the
martial
and
amatory
strains
of
the
ministrels
minnesingers
and
troubadors
men
fought
not
so
much
for
the
holy
sepulchre
as
to
gain
glory
for
themselves
in
the
best
and
only
field
where
glory
could
be
obtained
they
fought
not
as
zealots
but
as
soldiers
not
for
religion
but
for
honor
the
first
to
take
the
field
was
the
illustrious
german
emperor
frederick
barbarossa
marching
from
ratisbon
at
the
bead
of
a
magnificent
army
in
he
fought
his
way
through
the
greek
dominions
advanced
through
asia
minor
conquering
as
he
went
and
was
already
on
the
borders
of
palestine
when
imprudently
bathing
he
was
cut
off
in
the
seventieth
year
of
his
age
his
army
suffered
greatly
from
the
difficulties
of
their
march
and
the
attacks
of
the
saracens
the
wrecks
of
it
under
frederick
son
the
duke
of
swabia
proved
a
most
valuable
reinforcement
to
the
christians
in
syria
who
had
by
this
time
rallied
and
combined
against
the
domination
of
saladin
laying
siege
to
the
city
of
acre
on
the
a
town
of
so
much
importance
that
the
possession
of
it
was
considered
almost
equivalent
to
being
master
of
the
whole
country
upon
this
siege
commenced
in
august
was
concentrated
all
the
force
at
the
command
of
the
christians
in
palestine
the
remnants
of
the
two
great
military
orders
the
knights
templars
and
the
knights
hospitallers
the
survivors
of
frederick
army
together
with
such
bodies
of
crusaders
as
were
continually
arriving
from
europe
by
sea
guy
de
lusignan
was
the
commander
of
the
besieging
forces
and
so
skillfully
was
his
army
fortified
that
saladin
was
unable
to
dislodge
him
for
months
the
siege
continued
and
many
engagements
had
taken
place
between
the
christian
army
and
that
of
saladin
which
occupied
the
mountains
to
the
south
but
without
visible
advantage
on
either
side
such
was
the
position
of
affairs
when
early
in
the
summer
of
philip
of
france
and
richard
coeur
de
lion
of
england
arrived
with
their
fleets
the
struggle
was
soon
over
and
on
the
of
july
acre
surrendered
to
the
christians
had
the
crusaders
been
united
among
themselves
the
fall
of
this
city
might
have
been
but
preliminary
to
the
recovery
of
the
whole
country
the
rivalry
of
the
kings
of
france
and
england
however
prevented
their
cordial
and
not
long
after
the
capture
of
acre
philip
ruined
the
cause
of
the
crusade
by
returning
to
europe
after
gaining
many
important
successes
against
saladin
and
earning
for
himself
the
reputation
of
the
most
valiant
knight
of
the
age
richard
involved
in
disputes
with
the
other
chiefs
of
the
crusade
and
anxious
to
revisit
england
where
his
presence
was
becoming
daily
more
necessary
was
glad
to
conclude
an
honorable
peace
saladin
on
his
part
was
equally
willing
to
end
a
struggle
which
had
cost
him
so
much
a
truce
was
concluded
for
three
years
and
eight
months
during
which
christian
pilgrims
were
to
enjoy
the
liberty
of
visiting
jerusalem
without
hindrance
saladin
entertained
many
christians
in
his
own
palace
from
which
they
returned
their
tongues
laden
with
praises
of
the
noble
infidel
richard
and
saladin
never
met
but
each
admired
the
prowess
and
nobleness
of
soul
of
his
rival
the
christians
and
moslems
no
longer
looked
upon
each
other
as
barbarians
to
whom
mercy
was
a
crime
each
host
entertained
the
highest
admiration
for
the
bravery
and
magnanimity
of
the
other
and
in
their
occasional
truces
met
upon
the
most
friendly
terms
when
richard
the
king
of
england
lay
in
his
tent
consumed
by
a
fever
there
came
into
the
camp
camels
laden
with
snow
sent
by
his
enemy
the
sultan
saladin
to
assuage
his
disease
the
homage
of
one
brave
soldier
to
another
but
when
richard
was
returning
to
england
it
was
by
a
christian
prince
that
he
was
treacherously
seized
and
secretly
confined
it
was
on
the
of
october
that
richard
set
sail
for
europe
forced
by
stress
of
weather
to
land
at
zara
he
made
the
attempt
to
journey
through
the
continent
and
was
arrested
and
held
a
prisoner
while
passing
through
the
dominions
of
his
enemy
and
former
the
archduke
of
austria
and
remained
in
prison
in
vienna
for
several
months
he
returned
to
england
in
and
died
in
his
great
antagonist
saladin
had
died
in
not
long
after
the
christian
armies
left
palestine
at
the
end
of
the
crusade
the
crescent
waved
as
defiantly
as
ever
over
the
land
of
israel
the
fourth
crusade
the
fourth
crusade
from
to
led
by
henry
vi
of
germany
was
equally
a
failure
there
were
gained
some
brilliant
victories
but
dissensions
divided
the
armies
and
at
last
a
truce
was
made
with
the
mohammedans
it
is
true
that
these
victories
made
the
crusaders
masters
of
the
but
when
the
armies
departed
the
christian
king
found
himself
in
possession
of
cities
which
he
was
unable
to
garrison
and
which
he
felt
would
be
held
only
by
the
sufferance
of
the
enemy
the
fifth
crusade
in
the
year
a
new
crusade
was
set
on
foot
commanded
by
several
of
the
most
powerful
nobles
of
italy
and
france
instead
of
marching
at
once
against
the
infidels
the
crusaders
suffered
themselves
to
be
drawn
into
a
contest
with
the
greek
empire
just
at
this
time
the
emperor
of
the
greeks
had
been
deposed
and
deprived
of
his
eyes
by
his
own
brother
his
son
alexius
fled
to
europe
and
petitioned
the
assistance
of
the
latin
princes
against
the
usurper
promising
in
return
to
use
his
efforts
to
bring
about
a
union
of
the
greek
with
the
latin
church
and
to
employ
all
the
resources
of
his
kingdom
against
the
infidels
of
syria
the
temptation
of
such
a
prospect
could
not
be
resisted
the
crusaders
marched
into
greece
laid
siege
to
constantinople
and
took
the
city
by
storm
thereby
establishing
latin
christianity
in
the
eastern
metropolis
but
at
what
a
cost
neither
the
works
of
god
nor
man
were
respected
by
the
invaders
they
vented
their
brutal
ferocity
upon
the
one
and
satisfied
their
avarice
upon
the
other
in
sophia
the
silver
was
stripped
from
the
pulpit
an
exquisite
and
table
of
oblation
was
broken
in
pieces
the
sacred
chalices
were
turned
into
the
gold
fringe
was
ripped
off
the
veil
of
the
sanctuary
asses
and
horses
were
led
into
the
churches
to
carry
off
the
spoil
many
beautiful
bronze
pieces
above
all
price
as
works
of
art
were
broken
into
pieces
to
be
sold
as
old
metal
the
finely
chiseled
marble
was
also
destroyed
by
the
same
spirit
of
vandalism
two
thousand
people
were
put
to
the
sword
had
there
been
less
plunder
the
slaughter
would
in
all
probability
have
been
much
greater
for
fifty
years
the
empire
was
ruled
over
by
the
franks
meanwhile
the
knights
plunged
in
the
luxury
of
the
city
heeded
not
the
appeals
from
palestine
but
allowed
the
besieged
and
suffering
for
whose
rescue
they
had
enlisted
to
linger
and
die
without
an
effort
on
their
behalf
moved
to
desperation
in
this
emergency
the
christians
sent
to
europe
a
cry
for
help
the
sixth
crusade
the
urgent
appeal
from
palestine
caused
pope
innocent
iii
to
earnestly
preach
a
new
crusade
and
he
crowned
his
labors
and
appeals
with
his
famous
exclamation
sword
sword
start
from
thy
scabbard
and
sharpen
thyself
to
kill
though
the
many
disastrous
and
fruitless
expeditions
had
so
dampened
the
ardor
of
men
that
they
gave
little
heed
to
his
appeals
the
zeal
of
the
young
was
kindled
for
the
cause
to
which
their
elders
seemed
so
indifferent
the
children
of
germany
and
france
caught
the
madness
of
the
hour
and
resolved
upon
a
crusade
of
their
own
inspired
by
the
preaching
of
a
fanatical
priest
named
nicholas
twenty
thousand
boys
of
the
average
age
of
twelve
years
assembled
at
cologne
they
came
from
all
ranks
of
life
and
the
heir
of
the
proud
noble
marched
side
by
side
with
the
son
of
the
humblest
peasant
sisters
priests
and
servants
joined
the
throng
swelling
the
numbers
and
adding
to
the
confusion
their
journey
began
in
july
and
their
destination
was
palestine
and
they
were
to
go
by
way
of
rome
so
as
to
obtain
the
assistance
and
the
blessing
of
the
pope
in
their
ignorance
these
poor
children
thought
that
palestine
was
but
a
few
miles
distant
and
before
the
close
of
the
first
day
march
excited
voices
were
heard
asking
if
the
holy
sepulchre
was
in
sight
slowly
onward
the
multitude
moved
up
the
rhine
and
over
the
mont
cenis
pass
of
the
alps
into
italy
but
day
by
day
hearts
became
sick
with
continued
disappointment
and
little
feet
weary
with
the
miles
which
stretched
before
the
weak
and
the
sickly
were
the
first
to
give
out
and
though
they
struggled
to
keep
their
places
in
the
ranks
one
by
one
they
fell
by
the
wayside
to
die
alone
with
no
loving
hands
to
soothe
their
last
moments
or
to
moisten
their
parched
lips
with
a
drop
of
cold
water
the
path
of
the
youthful
crusaders
might
be
traced
by
the
marks
left
by
thousands
of
bleeding
feet
and
by
the
victims
stretched
in
death
along
the
course
death
disease
and
desertion
soon
thinned
their
ranks
to
such
an
extent
that
only
one
half
of
their
original
number
lived
to
reach
the
summit
of
the
alps
and
look
down
into
italy
the
journey
across
the
mountains
was
a
fearful
one
they
had
left
home
in
summer
when
their
raiment
was
thin
it
had
become
scanty
and
ragged
in
the
long
and
dusty
march
so
that
they
were
exposed
to
the
full
severity
of
the
cold
the
rocks
cut
their
shoeless
feet
but
nothing
remained
but
to
press
onward
or
to
lie
down
and
die
only
seven
thousand
lived
to
reach
genoa
where
they
were
received
coldly
but
where
they
were
at
last
permitted
to
stay
a
week
to
rest
then
again
onward
through
the
plains
of
italy
until
all
that
survived
made
their
way
to
rome
pope
innocent
partook
of
the
fanaticism
which
affected
all
europe
but
the
sight
of
these
little
victims
of
the
universal
delusion
reduced
to
mere
spectres
by
hardships
disease
and
famine
aroused
in
him
an
unexpected
human
sympathy
he
blessed
the
children
forbade
them
to
go
farther
and
when
rested
sent
them
back
to
their
german
homes
the
winter
had
passed
and
the
spring
had
come
again
before
the
few
survivors
reached
their
beloved
fatherland
day
by
day
there
came
straggling
into
the
german
cities
groups
of
these
victims
their
heads
drooping
for
shame
their
eyes
red
with
tears
their
clothing
in
rags
many
died
upon
realizing
the
last
hope
which
had
sustained
them
so
long
mothers
looked
in
vain
among
the
thin
ranks
for
their
beloved
ones
and
time
only
soothed
the
untold
misery
of
this
wild
enterprise
soon
after
the
departure
of
the
german
children
on
their
crusade
under
nicholas
another
of
about
equal
numbers
set
out
from
cologne
by
a
different
route
they
crossed
the
alps
by
the
pass
of
gothard
and
descended
into
eastern
italy
keeping
along
the
coast
of
the
adriatic
they
at
last
came
to
the
southern
front
of
the
peninsula
and
could
go
no
farther
they
met
with
a
fate
similar
to
that
of
the
first
band
with
the
additional
horror
that
many
of
them
were
seized
by
turkish
pirates
and
carried
away
into
slavery
the
few
who
survived
to
reach
southern
italy
embarked
on
a
vessel
and
never
were
heard
of
more
no
messenger
even
returned
to
the
hills
of
the
rhine
to
report
the
fate
of
the
little
ones
and
they
all
disappeared
from
the
aching
gaze
of
anxious
mothers
as
though
the
earth
had
swallowed
them
up
the
third
children
crusade
set
out
from
france
under
the
leadership
of
a
friar
named
stephen
they
numbered
thirty
thousand
and
their
first
destination
was
marseilles
whence
they
were
to
take
shipping
for
palestine
through
means
directly
provided
by
the
lord
through
the
broad
fields
of
france
during
the
hot
summer
days
the
crusaders
marched
every
mile
marked
by
victims
and
when
the
white
walls
of
the
city
of
their
destination
became
visible
their
numbers
were
reduced
one
half
the
charity
of
marseilles
was
taxed
to
its
utmost
to
provide
for
the
fifteen
thousand
mouths
open
to
receive
it
through
weary
weeks
the
children
waited
in
vain
for
the
promised
aid
from
the
lord
despair
was
more
fatal
than
famine
and
soon
two
thirds
of
those
who
had
reached
the
city
perished
when
their
numbers
were
reduced
to
five
thousand
apparently
the
promise
of
divine
aid
was
fulfilled
two
wealthy
and
benevolent
merchants
volunteered
to
send
the
children
on
to
their
destination
seven
ships
were
prepared
and
into
these
the
five
thousand
crowded
believing
their
troubles
were
at
an
end
the
ships
sailed
out
of
port
freighted
with
mother
love
and
religious
blessings
to
anxious
eyes
that
watched
their
departure
their
white
sails
lessening
in
the
distance
wafted
back
messages
of
hope
and
assurance
at
the
dawn
of
another
day
the
last
speck
had
disappeared
and
the
blue
waves
of
the
mediterranean
rolled
tranquilly
as
if
jealously
guarding
the
secrets
of
fate
but
time
went
on
vessels
direct
from
the
scene
of
conflict
saw
the
precious
fleet
news
of
stern
conflicts
with
the
infidels
was
brought
by
wandering
palmers
but
from
sailor
merchant
from
peasant
warrior
and
from
noble
scarred
with
saracenic
wounds
there
was
a
silence
in
regard
to
the
little
wanderers
streaming
eyes
fixed
upon
the
east
looked
in
vain
until
all
tears
were
quenched
in
death
eighteen
years
passed
since
the
children
fleet
sailed
out
of
european
life
then
a
vague
rumor
of
treachery
began
to
circulate
and
little
by
little
the
details
came
out
of
one
of
the
most
inhuman
crimes
that
ever
shocked
the
hearts
of
men
the
benevolent
merchants
who
furnished
the
ships
had
sold
the
children
to
the
barbarous
moslems
and
the
course
of
the
fleet
was
turned
from
east
to
south
on
the
second
day
out
a
great
storm
arose
and
two
of
the
ships
foundered
and
all
on
board
perished
a
more
horrible
fate
awaited
the
survivors
landing
in
a
city
of
the
moors
in
northern
africa
they
were
conducted
to
a
secure
prison
and
from
the
gloomy
portals
they
passed
out
into
distant
and
perpetual
slavery
one
by
one
the
captives
died
some
by
disease
some
by
cruelty
others
passed
away
in
old
age
at
length
all
dropped
their
weary
burdens
and
their
toils
and
sorrows
ended
not
one
of
the
hundreds
that
sailed
out
of
marseilles
on
that
sunny
afternoon
ever
saw
europe
again
rarely
in
the
history
of
the
world
has
a
story
in
real
life
been
freighted
with
so
much
woe
as
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
victims
of
the
strange
madness
which
swept
over
europe
less
than
seven
hundred
years
ago
peace
to
their
memories
at
last
an
army
was
organized
and
innocent
announced
that
he
himself
would
lead
the
host
to
the
defense
of
the
holy
sepulchre
but
his
death
intervened
before
the
project
was
ripe
andrew
king
of
hungary
was
the
only
monarch
who
had
leisure
or
inclination
to
leave
his
dominions
he
led
the
army
to
palestine
and
defeated
the
saracens
but
failed
to
follow
up
his
victory
and
soon
after
abandoned
the
enterprise
the
duke
of
austria
who
succeeded
him
as
leader
directed
the
whole
energy
of
the
crusade
against
egypt
and
damietta
which
commanded
the
river
nile
was
chosen
as
the
first
point
of
attack
finding
themselves
unable
to
successfully
defend
the
city
the
moslems
offered
to
yield
the
whole
of
palestine
to
the
christians
upon
the
condition
of
the
evacuation
of
egypt
with
a
blindness
almost
incredible
these
terms
were
refused
and
a
last
attack
made
on
the
walls
of
damietta
the
besieged
made
but
slight
resistance
and
the
christians
entered
the
city
to
find
out
of
seventy
thousand
but
three
thousand
remaining
so
fearful
had
been
the
scourge
of
plague
and
famine
several
months
were
spent
in
damietta
the
climate
either
weakened
the
frames
or
obscured
the
understandings
of
the
christians
for
after
their
conquest
they
remained
inactive
until
the
moslems
recuperated
their
army
and
were
able
to
recapture
damietta
and
expel
the
crusaders
from
egypt
with
a
view
to
the
recovery
of
the
holy
land
frederick
ii
of
germany
had
been
married
to
iolante
the
heiress
of
the
kingdom
of
jerusalem
his
early
life
was
spent
in
sicily
in
familiar
intercourse
with
jews
and
arabs
and
sicily
was
to
the
last
the
favored
portion
of
his
dominion
the
emperor
court
was
given
up
to
unpardonable
frivolities
in
the
eyes
of
pope
gregory
ix
one
of
whose
first
pontifical
acts
was
to
summon
frederick
to
a
new
crusade
the
emperor
paid
little
heed
to
the
aged
pope
exhortations
and
commands
postponing
from
time
to
time
the
period
of
his
departure
he
embarked
at
last
but
in
ten
days
returned
the
pope
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
and
pronounced
his
excommunication
frederick
treated
it
with
contempt
and
appealed
to
christendom
to
sustain
him
for
this
be
underwent
a
more
tremendous
excommunication
but
his
partisans
in
rome
raised
an
insurrection
and
expelled
the
pope
and
now
frederick
set
sail
of
his
own
accord
on
his
crusading
expedition
on
reaching
the
holy
land
he
was
received
with
joy
by
the
knights
and
pilgrims
but
the
clergy
held
aloof
from
him
as
under
the
ban
of
the
church
he
negotiated
privately
with
the
sultan
of
egypt
the
christian
camp
was
thronged
with
saracens
the
emperor
wore
a
saracen
dress
in
his
privacy
he
did
not
hesitate
to
say
i
came
not
here
to
deliver
the
holy
city
but
to
maintain
my
estimation
among
the
franks
to
the
sultan
he
appealed
out
of
your
goodness
surrender
to
me
jerusalem
as
it
is
that
i
may
be
able
to
lift
up
my
head
among
the
kings
of
christendom
accordingly
the
city
was
surrendered
to
him
the
pope
repudiated
the
transaction
while
the
emperor
proclaimed
his
successes
to
europe
the
pope
denounced
them
frederick
crowned
himself
at
jerusalem
being
unable
to
find
any
ecclesiastic
who
dared
to
perform
the
ceremony
and
departed
from
the
holy
land
he
prepared
to
enter
on
his
conflict
with
the
pontiff
and
drew
over
to
his
side
the
general
sentiment
of
europe
the
pope
was
made
to
give
way
and
peace
proclaimed
the
treaty
which
closed
the
sixth
crusade
was
for
ten
years
the
seventh
crusade
on
neither
side
probably
was
the
truce
strictly
kept
and
the
injuries
done
to
pilgrims
on
their
way
from
acre
to
jerusalem
were
alleged
as
a
sufficient
reason
for
sending
out
the
expedition
headed
by
richard
earl
of
cornwall
brother
of
the
english
henry
iii
and
afterward
king
of
the
romans
this
expedition
may
be
regarded
as
the
seventh
in
the
list
of
crusades
and
deserves
notice
as
having
been
brought
to
an
end
like
that
of
frederick
by
a
treaty
in
the
terms
of
the
latter
covenant
were
even
more
favorable
to
the
christians
but
two
years
later
the
latin
power
such
as
it
was
was
swept
away
by
the
sword
of
korasmians
pushed
onward
by
the
hordes
of
jenghiz
khan
the
awful
inroad
was
alleged
by
pope
innocent
iv
as
reason
for
summoning
christendom
again
to
the
rescue
of
the
holy
land
the
eighth
crusade
nearly
seven
years
passed
away
before
the
french
king
louis
ix
was
able
to
set
sail
for
egypt
the
royal
saint
who
lives
for
us
in
the
quaint
and
graphic
account
of
his
seneschal
joinville
may
with
truth
be
said
to
have
been
animated
by
a
spirit
of
devotion
and
intolerant
in
theory
and
bigoted
in
language
louis
had
that
true
charity
which
would
make
him
succor
his
enemies
not
less
than
his
friends
nor
was
his
bravery
less

in

disadvantage
louis
was
taken
prisoner
with
serene
patience
he
underwent
suffering
for
which
the
saracens
so
joinville
tells
us
frankly
confessed
that
they
would
have
renounced
mahommed

when
the
payment
of
his
ransom
set
him
free
he
made
a
pilgrimage
in

nazareth

he
achieved
nothing

his
humiliation
involved
no
dishonor
and
the
genuineness
of
his
faith
his
devotion

his
love

been
fully
tested
in
the
furnace
of
affliction
the
crusading
fire
was
now
rapidly
burning
itself
out
in
the
west
there
was
nothing
to
awaken
again
the
enthusiasm
which
had
been
stirred
by
peter
the
hermit
and
bernard
while
in
palestine
itself
the
only
signs
of
genuine
activity
were
furnished
by
the
antagonism
between
the
religious
orders
there
the
quarrels
of
templars
and
hospitallers
led
to
a
pitched
battle
in
in
which
almost
all
the
templars
were
slain
the
ninth
crusade
some
eight
years
later
the
tidings
that
antioch
had
been
taken
by

in

kingsley
ably
summarizes
the
effects
of
the
crusades
as
follow
egypt
was
still
the
center
of
communication
between
the
two
great
stations
of
the
moslem
power
and
indeed
as
lane
has
shown
us
in
his
most
valuable
translation
of
the
nights
possessed
a
peculiar
life
and
character
of
its
own
it
was
the
rash
object
of
the
crusaders
to
extinguish
that
life
palestine
was
first
their
point
of
attack
but
the
later
crusaders
seem
to
have
found
like
all
the
rest
of
the
world
that
the
destinies
of
palestine
could
not
be
separated
from
those
of
egypt
and
to
damietta
accordingly
was
directed
that
last
disastrous
attempt
of
louis
the
crusaders
failed
utterly
of
the
object
at
which
they
aimed
they
succeeded
in
an
object
of
which
they
never
dreamed
for
in
those
crusades
the
moslem
and
the
christian
had
met
face
to
face
and
found
that
both
were
men
that
they
had
a
common
humanity
a
common
eternal
standard
of
nobility
and
virtue
so
the
christian
knights
went
home
humbler
and
wiser
men
when
they
found
in
the
saracen
enemies
the
same
generosity
truth
mercy
chivalrous
which
they
fancied
their
own
peculiar
possession
and
added
to
that
a
civilization
and
a
learning
which
they
could
only
admire
and
imitate
and
thus
from
the
era
of
the
crusades
a
kindlier
feeling
sprang
up
between
the
crescent
and
the
cross
till
it
was
again
broken
by
the
fearful
invasions
of
the
turks
through
eastern
europe
the
learning
of
the
moslem
as
well
as
their
commerce
began
to
pour
rapidly
into
christendom
both
from
spain
egypt
and
syria
and
thus
the
crusaders
were
indeed
rewarded
according
to
their
deeds
they
took
the
sword
and
perished
by
the
sword
but
the
truly
noble
element
in
them
the
element
which
our
hearts
and
reasons
recognize
and
love
in
spite
of
all
the
folly
and
fanaticism
of
the
crusades
whensoever
we
read
or
the
the
element
of
loyal
faith
and
did
not
go
unrequited
they
learned
wider
juster
views
of
man
and
virtue
which
i
can
not
help
believing
must
have
had
great
effect
in
weakening
in
their
minds
the
old
exclusive
bigoted
notions
and
in
paving
the
way
for
the
great
outburst
of
free
thought
and
the
great
assertion
of
the
dignity
of
humanity
which
the
fifteenth
century
beheld
they
opened
a
path
for
that
influx
of
scientific
knowledge
which
has
produced
in
after
centuries
the
most
enormous
effects
on
the
welfare
of
europe
and
made

possible
for
millions
who
would
otherwise

chapter
iii
of
freedom
in
alpine
while
the
great
sovereigns
of
europe
were
busy
in
fighting
the
moslems
in
palestine
they
did
not
entirely
neglect
affairs
at
home
some
of
them
were
very
good
rulers
protecting
their
subjects
and
maintaining
good
order
and
others
were
tyrannical
and
imposed
all
sorts
of
taxes
and
heavy
burdens
upon
the
people
up
among
the
alps
where
the
country
is
made
up
of
rough
rocky
mountains
and
narrow
valleys
lived
a
people
who
were
practically
free
they
lived
in
little
communities
each
one
of
which
elected
its
own
magistrate
or
governor
and
made
its
own
laws
the
region
was
so
poor
and
rough
that
the
neighboring
kings
little
cared
to
get
possession
of
it
and
the
alpine
dwellers
had
a
greater
amount
of
freedom
than
any
other
people
of
europe
the
country
was
divided
into
little
separate
communities
one
of
which
was
called
schwytz
and
this
afterward
gave
the
name
to
the
whole
country
switzerland
this
country
of
the
swiss
was
really
a
part
of
the
german
empire
but
the
emperors
had
extended
their
rule
over
the
lower
parts
of
the
country
leaving
the
forest
cantons
free
and
a
brave
courageous
and
industrious
people
grew
up
there
no
among
the
alps
for
every
person
worked
and
no
body
tried
to
rob
his
neighbor
of
his
honest
earnings
they
were
a
strong
athletic
race
and
the
monarchs
of
the
surrounding
countries
were
glad
to
secure
swiss
soldiers
for
it
was
said
that
the
swiss
never
deserted
in
while
wallace
was
struggling
for
freedom
in
scotland
albert
of
austria
the
second
of
the
house
of
hapsburg
resolved
to
get
possession
of
the
free
forest
cantons
he
observed
great
secrecy
in
carrying
out
his
designs
and
it
was
not
until
a
or
bailiff
was
permanently
established
in
the
country
supported
by
austrian
soldiers
that
the
people
awakened
to
their
danger
the
story
that
follows
is
one
that
all
true
swiss
delight
to
believe
and
though
it
may
not
be
true
in
regard
to
names
and
details
yet
as
a
record
of
the
main
incidents
of
history
it
is
substantially
correct
the
first
austrian
bailiff
was
hermann
gessler
who
built
a
strong
fortress
at
küssnacht
in
uri
at
first
he
professed
great
love
for
the
people
but
when
he
became
firmly
established
he
threw
off
the
mask
and
showed
himself
to
be
a
cruel
cowardly
tyrant
he
was
both
vain
and
greedy
and
he
exacted
both
homage
and
tribute
from
the
surrounding
peasantry
property
was
seized
by
the
soldiers
and
should
the
owner
venture
to
remonstrate
he
was
mercilessly
beaten
or
killed
on
the
spot
complaints
to
the
governor
were
followed
by
fresh
outrages
until
no
one
even
in
the
most
secluded
valleys
considered
himself
safe
here
tyranny
as
usual
overstepped
the
bounds
of
safety
the
free
spirit
born
of
toil
and
privations
in
the
would
not
long
endure
the
outrages
to
which
the
people
were
subjected
a
leader
only
was
needed
to
induce
a
general
revolt
and
this
leader
was
found
in
the
person
of
william

illustration
william
tell
according
to
the
received
accounts

born
at
bürgelen
a
secluded
hamlet

the
canton

the
lake

the
year

like
his
forefathers
was
the
proprietor
of
a
cottage
a
few
small
fields
a
vineyard
and
an
orchard

william

reached
the
age
of
twenty
his
father

to
have
died

to
him
these
humble
possessions

by
nature
with
a
lofty
and
energetic
mind

was
distinguished
also
by
great
physical
strength
and
manly
beauty
he
was
taller
by
a
head
than
most
of
his
companions
he
loved
to
climb
the
rugged
rocks
of
his
native
mountains
in
pursuit
of
the
chamois
and
to
steer
his
boat
across
the
lake
in
time
of
storm
and
of
danger
the
load
of
wood
which
he
could
bear
upon
his
shoulders
was
double

which
any
ordinary
man
could
support
with
other
sources
of
happiness

that
of
possessing
an
intimate
friend

dwelt
amid
the
rocky
heights

unterwalden
arnold

melchthal

this
associate

similar
in
many
salient
points
of
character
there
was
still
an
essential
difference
between
the
two
men
arnold

melchthal
while
he
loved
his
country
with
an
ardor
equal
to

temperament

impulse

succeeded
in

his

by
the
stern
force

the
two

passed
their
days
in
the

foresaw
on
the
arrival

many
of
the
misfortunes
which
must
inevitably
follow
his
iron
rule
and
without
explaining
his
views
even
to
arnold
of
melchthal
without
needlessly
alarming
his
family
endeavored
to
devise
some
means
not
of
bearing
the
yoke
patiently
but
of
delivering
his
country
from
the
galling
oppression
which
albert
had
brought
upon
it
the
hero
felt
satisfied
that
the
evil
deeds
of
the
governor
would
sooner
or
later
bring
just
retribution
upon
him
for
this
and
many
other
reasons
therefore
despite
his
own
secret
wishes
when
arnold
poured
out
his
fiery
wrath
in
the
ear
of
his
friend
he
listened
calmly
and
to
avoid
inflaming
him
more
avowed
none
of
his

even
feelings
in

one
evening
however
william

and
his

sat
in
front
of
their
cottage
watching
their
son
amusing
himself
amid
the
flocks
when
the
former
grew
more
thoughtful
and
sad
than
usual
presently
tell
spoke
and
for
the
first
time
imparted
to
his
wife
some
of
his
most
secret
designs
while
the
conversation
was
still
proceeding
the
parents
saw
their
son
rush
toward
them
crying
for
help
and
shouting
the
name
of
old
melchthal
as
he
spoke
arnold
father
appeared
in
sight
led
by
his
and
feeling
his
way
with
a
stick
tell
and
his
wife
hastened
forward
and
discovered
to
their
inconceivable
horror
that
their
friend
was
blind
his
eyes
having
been
put
out
with
hot
irons
the
hero
of
bürgelen
burning
with
just
indignation
called
on
the
old
man
to
explain
the
fearful
sight
and
also
the
cause
of
arnold
absence
it
appeared
that
that
very
morning
the
father
son
and
were
in
the
fields
loading
a
couple
of
oxen
with
produce
for
the
when
an
austrian
soldier
presented
himself
and
having
examined
the
animals
which
appeared
to
suit
his
fancy
ordered
their
owner
to
unyoke
the
beasts
preparatory
to
his
driving
them
off
adding
insolence
to
tyranny
he
further
remarked
that
such
might
very
well
draw
their
own
plows
and
carts
arnold
furious
at
the
man
daring
impertinence
was
only
restrained
by
his
father
earnest
entreaties
from
sacrificing
the
robber
on
the
spot
nothing
however
could
prevent
him
from
aiming
a
blow
at
the
soldier
which
broke
two
of
his
fingers
the
enraged
soldier
then
retreated
but
old
melchthal
who
well
knew
the
character
of
gessler
immediately
forced
arnold
much
against
his
inclination
to
go
and
conceal
himself
for
some
days
in
the
righi
scarcely
had
arnold
departed
in
this
direction
when
a
detachment
of
guards
from
altorf
surrounded
their
humble
tenement
and
dragged
old
melchthal
before
gessler
who
ordered
him
to
give
up
his
son
furious
at
the
refusal
which
ensued
the
tyrant
commanded
the
old
man
eyes
to
be
put
out
and
then
sent
him
forth
blind
to
deplore
his
misfortunes
tell
heard
the
story
of
melchthal
in
silence
and
when
he
had
finished
inquired
the
exact
spot
of
his
son
concealment
the
father
replied
that
it
was
in
a
particular
cavern
of
mount
righi
the
desert
rocks
of
which
place
are
unknown
to
the
emissaries
of
the
governor
and
there
he
had
promised
to
remain
until
he
received
his
permission
to
come
forth
this
tell
requested
might
be
granted
immediately
and
turning
to
his
son
ordered
him
to
start
at
once
for
the
righi
with
a
message
to
arnold
walter
obeyed
gladly
and
providing
himself
with
food
and
receiving
private
instructions
from
his
father
went
on
his
journey
under
cover
of
the
night
tell
himself
then
threw
around
his
own
person
a
cloak
of
seized
his
quiver
full
of
sharp
arrows
and
taking
his
terrible
bow
which
few
could
bend
in
hand
bade
adieu
to
his
wife
for
a
few
days
and
took
his
departure
in
an
opposite
direction
from
that
pursued
by
his
son
it
was
quite
dawn
when
walter
reached
the
righi
and
a
slight
column
of
blue
smoke
speedily
directed
him
to
the
spot
where
arnold
lay
concealed
the
intrusion
at
first
startled
the
fugitive
but
recognizing
tell
son
he
listened
eagerly
to
his
dismal
story
the
conclusion
of
which
roused
in
him
so
much
fury
that
he
would
have
rushed
forth
at
once
to
assassinate
gessler
had
not
walter
restrained
him
schooled
by
tell
he
informed
him
that
his
father
was
engaged
in
preparing
vengeance
for
the
tyrant
crime
being
at
that
moment
with
werner
stauffacher
concerting
proper
measures
of
resistance
said
my
father
tell
arnold
of
this
new
villany
of
the
governor
and
say
that
it
is
not
rage
which
can
give
us
just
revenge
but
the
utmost
exertion
of
courage
and
prudence
i
leave

to
bid
werner
arm
his
canton
let
melchthal
go
to

with

and
werner
in
the
field
of

scarcely
taking
time
to
refresh
himself
with

sent
walter
on
his
homeward
journey
while
he
started
for
stautz
walter
when
alone
turned
his
steps
toward
altorf
where
unfortunately
and
unknown
to
himself
he
came
into
the
presence
of
gessler
to
whom
he
uttered
somewhat
hard
things
about
the
state
of
the
country
being
led
to
commit
himself
by
the
artful
questions
of
the
tyrant
who
immediately
ordered
the
lad
into
confinement
with
strict
injunctions
to
the
guards
to
seize
whomsoever
should
claim
him
meanwhile
certain
doubts
and
fears
from
he
knew
not
what
cause
arose
in
the
mind
of
gessler
and
struck
him
with
a
presentiment
that
all
was
not
right
he
imagined
that
the
people
wore
in
their
looks
less
abject
submission
to
his
authority
and
the
better
to
satisfy
himself
of
the
correctness
or
erroneousness
of
this
view
he
commanded
berenger
to
erect
at
dawn
of
day
in
the
of
altorf
a
pole
on
the
point
of
which
he
was
to
place
the
ducal
cap
of
austria
an
order
was
further
promulgated
to
the
effect
that
every
one
passing
near
or
within
sight
of
it
should
make
obeisance
in
proof
of
his
honor
and
fealty
to
the
duke
numerous
soldiers
under
arms
were
directed
to
surround
the
place
to
keep
the
avenues
and
to
compel
the
to
bend
with
proper
respect
to
the
emblem
of
the
governing
power
of
the
three
cantons
gessler
likewise
determined
that
whoever
should
disobey
the
mandate
should
be
accused
of
disaffection
and
treated
accordingly
a
measure
which
promised
both
to
discover
the
discontented
and
furnish
sufficient
grounds
for
their
punishment
numerous
detachments
of
troops
among
whom
money
had
been
previously
distributed
were
then
placed
around
to
see
that
his
commands
were
scrupulously
obeyed
history
scarcely
records
another
instance
of
tyranny
so
galling
and
humiliating
to
the
oppressed
and
so
insolent
on
the
part
of
its
author
the
proceedings
of
tell
in
the
interval
were
of
the
deepest
concern
to
the
country
having
arrived
within
the
territory
of
schwytz
and
at
the
village
of
stainea
he
called
at
the
house
of
werner
and
being
admitted
threw
at
his
feet
a
heavy
bundle
of
lances
arrows
and
swords
werner
stauffacher
cried
tell
the
time
is
come
for
action
and
without
a
moment
delay
he
informed
his
friend
of
all
that
had
passed
dwelling
minutely
on
every
detail
and
when
he
had
at
length
finished
the
cautious
werner
could
restrain
his
wrath
no
longer
but
exclaimed
clasping
the
hero
hand
friend
let
us
begin
i
am
ready
after
further
brief
conference
they
by
separate
ways
carried
round
arms
to
their
friends
in
the
town
and
neighboring
villages
many
hours
were
thus
consumed
and
when
their
weapons
were
at
last
distributed
they
both
returned
to
stauffacher
house
snatched
some
slight
refreshment
and
then
sped
on
their
way
to
grütli
accompanied
by
ten
of
their
most
tried
adherents
the
lake
of
lucerne
was
soon
reached
and
a
boat
procured
werner
perceiving
the
furious
tempest
inquired
of
tell
if
his
skill
would
enable
him
to
struggle
against
the
storm
arnold
awaits
us
cried
william
and
the
fate
of
our
country
depends
on
this
interview
with
these
words
he
leaped
into
the
boat
werner
jumped
after
him
and
the
rest
followed
tell
cast
loose
the
agitated
vessel
seized
the
tiller
and
hoisting
sail
the
little
craft
flew
along
the
waves
presently
it
is
said
the
wind
moderated
and
ere
they
reached
the
opposite
side
had
ceased
altogether
a
phenomenon
common
in
these
mountain
lakes
the
boat
was
now
made
fast
and
the
conspirators
hastened
to
the
field
of
grütli
where
at
the
mouth
of
a
cavern
of
the
same
name
arnold
and
walter
fürst
awaited
them
each
with
ten
other
companions
tell
allowed
no
consideration
of
natural
feeling
to
silence
the
calls
of
duty
but
at
once
came
to
the
point
he
first
gave
a
brief
sketch
of
the
state
of
the
country
under
the
austrian
bailiffs
and
having
shown
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
companions
the
necessity
for
immediate
and
combined
action
is
related
to
have
added
we
may
have
our
plans
frustrated
by
delay
and
the
time
has
come
for
action
i
ask
only
a
few
days
for
preparation
unterwalden
and
schwytz
are
armed
three
hundred
and
fifty
warriors
are
i
am
assured
ready
i
will
remain
in
altorf
and
as
soon
as
i
receive
tidings
from
fürst
will
fire
a
huge
pile
of
wood
near
my
house
at
this
signal
let
all
march
to
the
rendezvous
and
when
united
we
will
pour
down
upon
altorf
where
i
will
then
strive
to
rouse
the
people
this
plan
of
the
campaign
was
agreed
to
and
it
was
further
resolved
that
in
the
enterprise
upon
which
they
were
now
embarked
no
one
should
be
guided
by
his
own
private
opinion
nor
ever
forsake
his
friends
that
they
should
jointly
live
or
jointly
die
in
defense
of
the
common
cause
that
each
should
in
his
own
vicinity
promote
the
object
in
view
trusting
that
the
whole
nation
would
one
day
have
cause
to
bless
their
friendly
union
that
the
count
of
hapsburg
should
be
deprived
of
none
of
his
lands
vassals
or
prerogatives
that
the
freedom
which
they
had
inherited
from
their
fathers
they
were
determined
to
assert
and
to
hand
down
to
their
children
untainted
and
undiminished
then
stauffacher
fürst
and
melcthal
and
the
other
conspirators
stepped
forward
and
raising
their
hands
swore
that
they
would
die
in
defense
of
that
freedom
after
this
solemn
oath
and
after
an
agreement
that
new
year
day
should
be
chosen
for
the
outbreak
unless
in
the
meantime
a
signal
fire
should
arouse
the
inhabitants
on
some
sudden
emergency
the
heroes
separated
arnold
returned
to
stautz
werner
to
schwytz
while
tell
and
fürst
took
their
way
to
altorf
the
sun
already
shone
brightly
as
tell
entered
the
town
and
he
at
once
advanced
into
the
public
place
where
the
first
object
which
caught
his
eye
was
a
handsome
cap
embroidered
with
gold
stuck
upon
the
end
of
a
long
pole
soldiers
walked
around
it
in
respectful
silence
and
the
people
of
altorf
as
they
passed
bowed
their
heads
profoundly
to
the
symbol
of
power
tell
was
much
surprised
at
this
new
and
strange
manifestation
of
servility
and
leaning
on
his
gazed
contemptuously
both
on
the
people
and
the
soldiers
berenger
captain
of
the
guard
at
length
observed
this
man
who
alone
amid
a
cringing
populace
carried
his
head
erect
he
went
to
him
and
fiercely
asked
why
he
neglected
to
pay
obedience
to
the
orders
of
hermann
gessler
tell
replied
that
he
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
bow
to
a
hat
or
even
to
the
one
which
the
hat
represented
this
bold
language
surprised
berenger
who
ordered
tell
to
be
disarmed
and
then
surrounded
by
guards
he
was
carried
before
the
governor
wherefore
demanded
the
incensed
bailiff
hast
thou
disobeyed
my
orders
and
failed
in
thy
respect
to
the
emperor
why
hast
thou
dared
to
pass
before
the
sacred
badge
of
thy
sovereign
without
the
evidence
of
homage
required
of
thee
verily
answered
tell
with
mock
humility
how
this
happened
i
know
not
is
an
accident
and
no
mark
of
contempt
suffer
me
therefore
in
thy
clemency
to
depart
gessler
was
irritated
at
this
reply
feeling
assured
that
there
was
something
beneath
the
tranquil
and
bitter
smile
of
the
prisoner
which
he
could
not
fathom
suddenly
he
was
struck
by
the
resemblance
which
existed
between
him
and
the
boy
walter
whom
he
had
met
the
previous
day
and
immediately
ordered
him
to
be
brought
forward
gessler
now
inquired
the
prisoner
name
which
he
no
sooner
learned
than
he
recognized
as
that
of
the
archer
so
celebrated
throughout
the
canton
as
soon
as
the
youth
arrived
the
governor
turned
to
tell
and
told
him
that
he
had
heard
of
his
extraordinary
dexterity
and
was
accordingly
determined
to
put
it
to
proof
while
beholding
justice
done
the
people
of
altorf
shall
also
admire
thy
skill
thy
son
shall
be
placed
a
hundred
yards
distant
with
an
apple
on
his
head
if
thou
hast
the
good
fortune
to
carry
off
the
apple
in
triumph
with
one
of
thy
arrows
i
pardon
both
and
restore
your
liberty
if
thou
refusest
this
trial
thy
son
shall
die
before
thine
eyes
tell
implored
gessler
to
spare
him
so
cruel
an
experiment
but
finding
the
governor
inexorable
the
hero
submitted
to
the
trial
he
was
conducted
into
the
public
place
where
the
required
distance
was
measured
by
berenger
a
double
row
of
soldiers
shutting
up
three
sides
of
the
square
the
people
and
trembling
pressed
behind
walter
stood
with
his
back
to
a
linden
tree
patiently
awaiting
the
exciting
moment
hermann
gessler
some
distance
behind
watched
every
motion
his
and
belt
were
handed
to
tell
he
tried
the
point
broke
the
weapon
and
demanded
his
quiver
it
was
brought
to
him
and
emptied
at
his
feet
william
stooped
down
and
taking
a
long
time
to
choose
one
managed
to
hide
a
second
in
his
girdle
the
other
he
held
in
his
hand
and
proceeded
to
string
his
bow
while
berenger
cleared
away
the
remaining
arrows
after
hesitating
he
drew
the
bow
aimed
shot
and
the
apple
struck
through
the
core
was
carried
away
by
the
arrow
the
was
filled
by
loud
cries
of
admiration
walter
flew
to
embrace
his
father
who
overcome
by
the
excess
of
his
emotions
fell
insensible
to
the
ground
thus
exposing
the
second
arrow
to
view
gessler
stood
over
him
awaiting
his
recovery
which
speedily
took
place
tell
rose
and
turned
away
from
the
governor
who
however
thus
addressed
him
incomparable
archer
i
will
keep
my
promise
but
added
he
tell
me
what
needed
you
with
that
second
arrow
which
you
have
i
see
secreted
in
your
girdle
one
was
surely
enough
the
second
shaft
replied
tell
was
to
pierce
thy
heart
tyrant
if
i
had
chanced
to
harm
my
son
at
these
words
the
terrified
governor
retired
behind
his
guards
revoked
his
promise
of
pardon
commanding
him
further
to
be
placed
in
irons
and
to
be
reconducted
to
the
fort
he
was
obeyed
and
as
slight
murmurs
rose
among
the
people
double
patrols
of
austrian
soldiers
paraded
the
streets
and
forced
the
citizens
to
retire
to
their
houses
walter
released
fled
to
join
arnold
of
melchthal
according
to
a
whispered
order
from
his
father
gessler
reflecting
on
the
aspect
of
the
people
and
fearful
that
some
plot
was
in
progress
which
his
accidental
shortness
of
provisions
rendered
more
unfortunate
determined
to
rid
his
citadel
of
the
object
which
might
induce
an
attack
with
this
in
view
he
summoned
berenger
and
said
to
him
i
am
about
to
leave
altorf
and
you
shall
command
during
my
absence
i
leave
my
brave
soldiers
who
will
readily
obey
your
voice
and
soon
returning
with
supplies
and
reinforcements
we
will
crush
this
vile
people
and
punish
them
for
their
insolent
murmurings
prepare
me
a
large
boat
in
which
thirty
men
picked
from
my
guard
may
depart
with
me
as
soon
as
night
comes
on
load
this
audacious
tell
with
chains
and
send
him
on
board
i
will
myself
take
him
where
he
can
expiate
his
crimes
the
evening
was
fine
and
promising
the
boat
danced
along
the
placid
waters
the
air
was
pure
the
waves
tranquil
the
stars
shone
brightly
in
the
sky
a
light
southern
breeze
aided
the
efforts
of
the
oarsmen
and
tempered
the
rigor
of
the
cold
which
night
in
that
season
rendered
almost
insupportable
so
near
the
glaciers
all
appeared
in
gessler
favor
the
extent
of
the
first
section
of
the
lake
was
soon
passed
and
the
boat
headed
for
brunnen
tell
meantime
loaded
with
irons
gazed
with
eager
eye
on
the
desert
rocks
of
grütli
where
the
day
before
he
had
planned
with
his
friends
for
the
deliverance
of
his
country
while
painful
thoughts
crossed
his
mind
his
looks
were
attracted
by
a
dim
light
which
burst
forth
near
his
own
house
presently
this
light
increased
and
before
long
a
blaze
arose
visible
all
over
uri
the
heart
of
the
prisoner
beat
with
joy
for
he
felt
that
all
efforts
were
making
to
rescue
him
gessler
observed
the
flame
which
in
reality
was
a
to
arouse
the
cantons
but
supposed
it
some
swiss
peasant
house
accidentally
in
flames
suddenly
however
between
fluelen
and
sissigen
when
in
deep
water
intermingled
with
shoals
the
south
wind
ceased
to
blow
and
one
of
those
storms
which
are
common
on
the
lake
commenced
a
north
wind
burst
upon
them
raised
the
waves
to
a
great
height
and
dashed
them
over
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
which
giving
way
to
the
fury
of
the
storm
flew
toward
the
shore
that
rocky
and
precipitous
menaced
their
lives
the
bleak
wind
brought
also
frost
snow
and
sleet
which
spread
darkness
over
the
waters
and
covered
the
hands
and
faces
of
the
rowers
with
ice
the
soldiers
inert
and
prayed
for
life
while
gessler
but
ill
prepared
for
death
was
profuse
in
his
offers
of
money
and
other
rewards
if
they
would
rouse
themselves
to
save
him
in
this
emergency
the
austrian
bailiff
was
reminded
by
one
of
his
attendants
that
the
prisoner
tell
was
no
less
skillful
in
the
management
of
a
boat
than
in
the
exercise
of
the
bow
and
see
my
lord
said
one
of
the
men
representing
to
gessler
the
imminent
peril
they
were
all
incurring
all
are
paralyzed
with
terror
and
even
the
pilot
is
unable
to
manage
the
helm
gessler
fear
of
tell
induced
him
at
first
to
hesitate
but
the
prayers
of
the
soldiers
becoming
pressing
he
told
the
prisoner
that
if
he
could
take
them
safely
through
the
storm
he
should
be
at
once
unbound
tell
having
replied
that
by
the
grace
of
god
he
could
still
save
them
was
instantly
freed
from
his
shackles
and
placed
at
the
helm
when
the
boat
answering
to
a
kept
its
course
steadily
through
the
bellowing
surge
as
if
conscious
of
the
free
spirit
which
had
now
taken
the
command
guiding
the
obedient
tiller
at
his
will
tell
pointed
the
head
of
the
boat
in
the
direction
whence
they
came
which
he
knew
to
be
the
only
safe
course
and
encouraging
and
cheering
the
rowers
made
rapid
and
steady
progress
through
the
water
the
darkness
which
now
wrapped
them
round
prevented
gessler
from
discovering
that
he
had
turned
his
back
on
his
destination
tell
continued
on
his
way
nearly
the
whole
night
the
dying
light
of
the
on
the
mountain
serving
as
a
beacon
in
enabling
him
to
approach
the
shores
of
schwytz
and
to
avoid
the
shoals
between
sissigen
and
fluelen
are
two
mountains
the
greater
and
the
lesser
achsenberg
whose
sides
hemmed
in
and
rising
perpendicularly
from
the
bed
of
the
lake
offer
not
a
single
platform
where
human
foot
can
stand
when
near
this
place
dawn
broke
in
the
eastern
sky
and
gessler
the
danger
appearing
to
decrease
scowled
upon
tell
in
sullen
silence
as
the
prow
of
the
vessel
was
driven
inland
tell
perceived
a
solitary
and
called
to
the
rowers
to
redouble
their
efforts
till
they
should
have
passed
the
precipice
ahead
observing
with
ominous
truth
that
it
was
the
most
dangerous
point
on
the
whole
lake
the
soldiers
here
recognized
their
position
and
pointed
it
out
to
gessler
who
demanded
of
tell
what
he
meant
by
taking
them
back
to
altorf
william
without
answering
him
brought
the
bow
suddenly
close
upon
the
rock
seized
his
bow
and
with
an
effort
which
sent
the
unguided
craft
back
into
the
lake
sprang
on
shore
scaled
the
rocks
and
took
the
direction
of
schwytz
having
thus
escaped
the
clutches
of
the
governor
he
made
for
the
main
road
between
art
and
küssnacht
and
there
hid
himself
until
such
a
time
as
the
bailiff
should
pass
that
way
gessler
and
his
attendants
having
with
great
difficulty
effected
a
landing
at
brunnen
proceeded
toward
küssnacht
in
the
spot
still
known
as
the
hollow
way
and
marked
by
a
chapel
tell
overheard
the
threats
pronounced
against
himself
should
he
once
more
be
caught
and
in
default
of
his
apprehension
vengeance
was
vowed
against
his
family
tell
felt
that
the
safety
of
himself
and
his
wife
and
children
to
say
nothing
of
the
duty
he
owed
to
his
country
required
the
tyrant
death
and
seizing
an
arrow
he
pierced
gessler
to
the
heart
the
bold
deed
accomplished
the
hero
effected
his
escape
to
stemen
where
he
found
werner
stauffacher
preparing
to
march
immediate
action
was
now
necessary
but
the
original
decision
of
the
conspirators
remained
unchanged
accordingly
on
the
morning

made
prisoner
and
compelled
to
promise
that
he
would
never
again
set
foot
within
the
territory
of
the
three
cantons
after
which
he
was
allowed
to
retire
to
lucerne

the
same
morning
at
the
head
of
the
men
of
schwytz
destroyed
the
fortress
of

the
men
of

took
possession
of
altorf
on
the
following
sunday
the
deputies
of
uri
schwytz
and
unterwalden
met
and
renewed
that
fraternal
league
which
has
endured
to
this
day
in
leopold
second
son
of
albert
determined
to
punish
the
confederate
cantons
for
their
revolt
and
accordingly
marched
against
them
at
the
head
of
a
considerable
army
accompanied
by
a
numerous
retinue
of
nobles
count
otho
of
strasberg
one
of
his
ablest
generals
crossed
the
brunig
with
a
body
of
four
thousand
men
intending
to
attack
upper
unterwalden
the
bailiffs
of
willisan
of
wodhausen
and
of
lucerne
meantime
armed
a
fourth
of
that
number
to
make
a
descent
on
the
lower
division
of
the
same
canton
while
the
emperor
in
person
at
the
head
of
his
army
of
reserve
poured
down
from
egerson
on
mogarten
in
the
country
of
schwytz
ostentatiously
displaying
an
extensive
supply
of
rope
where
with
to
hang
the
chiefs
of
the
rebels
the
confederates
in
order
to
oppose
this
formidable
invasion
occupied
a
position
in
the
mountains
bordering
on
the
convent
of
our
lady
of
the
hermits
four
hundred
men
of
uri
and
three
hundred
of
unterwalden
had
effected
a
junction
with
the
warriors
of
schwytz
who
formed
the
principal
force
of
the
little
army
fifty
men
banished
from
this
latter
canton
offered
themselves
to
combat
beneath
their
banner
intending
to
efface
by
their
valor
the
remembrance
of
past
faults
early
on
the
morning
of
november
some
thousands
of
austrian
knights
slowly
ascended
the
hill
on
which
the
swiss
were
posted
with
the
hope
of
dislodging
them
the
latter
however
advanced
to
meet
their
enemies
uttering
the
most
terrific
cries
the
band
of
banished
men
having
precipitated
large
stones
and
fragments
of
rocks
from
the
hillsides
and
from
overhanging
cliffs
rushed
from
behind
the
sheltering
influence
of
a
thick
fog
and
threw
the
advancing
columns
into
confusion
the
austrians
immediately
broke
their
ranks
and
presently
a
complete
rout
with
terrible
slaughter
ensued
the
flower
of
the
austrian
chivalry
perished
on
the
field
of
morgarten
beneath
the
halberts
arrows
and
clubs
of
the
shepherds
leopold
himself
though
he
succeeded
in
gaining
the
shattered
remnant
of
his
forces
had
a
narrow
escape
while
the
swiss
animated
by
victory
hastened
to
unterwalden
where
they
defeated
another
body
of
austrians
in
this
instance
count
otho
had
as
narrow
an
escape
as
the
emperor
after
these
two
fields
the
confederates
hastened
to
renew
their
ancient
alliance
which
was
solemnly
sworn
to
in
an
assembly
held
at
brunnen
on
the
eighth
day
of
december
after
the
battle
of
morgarten
one
canton
after
another
threw
off
the
austrian
yoke
and
joined
the
forest
cantons
until
nearly
all
switzerland
was
joined
in
a
confederacy
a
later
war
waged
by
albert
proved
disastrous
to
the
austrian
cause
and
ended
by
a
further
consolidation
of
the
swiss
cantons
in
seventy
years
after
morgarten
the
austrians
made
another
attempt
to
bring
the
brave
mountaineers
into
subjection
an
army
of
nine
thousand
men
the
best
trained
soldiers
of
the
empire
under
the
lead
of
the
archduke
leopold
invaded
the
country
to
these
the
confederates
opposed
a
force
of
fourteen
hundred
they
met
in
a
valley
near
the
lake
of
sempach
the
austrians
had
learned
something
of
swiss
warfare
and
knew
that
they
stood
no
chance
in
a
conflict
with
the
swiss
and
so
they
formed
their
men
into
squares
with
a
wall
of
bristling
spears
on
every
side
upon
this
solid
mass
of
men
the
swiss
could
make
no
impression
in
vain
they
charged
with
the
fiery
courage
which
had
so
often
gained
them
the
victory
they
could
find
no
vulnerable
point
in
the
serried
columns
and
it
seemed
that
the
brave
mountaineers
must
all
perish
and
leave
their
homes
again
to
the
mercy
of
the
austrian
soldiers
but
when
almost
in
despair
the
tide
of
battle
was
turned
by
the
acts
of
a
single
swiss
soldier
arnold
winkelried
of
unterwalden
he
communicated
his
plan
to
his
immediate
neighbors
and
then
rushing
forward
he
grasped
as
many
of
the
austrian
spears
as
he
could
reach
and
gathering
them
together
he
bowed
to
the
ground
with
the
spears
buried
in
his
breast
into
the
breach
his
companions
rushed
and
with
their
powerful
swords
they
soon
widened
the
space
so
that
the
whole
swiss
force
had
room
for
action
the
austrians
were
almost
annihilated
leopold
himself
being
slain
the
poet
montgomery
has
given
the
following
version
of
this
event
arnold
winkelried
make
way
for
liberty
he
cried
make
way
for
liberty
and
died
in
arms
the
austrian
phalanx
stood
a
living
wall
a
human
wood
a
wall
where
every
conscious
stone
seemed
to
its
kindred
thousands
grown
a
rampart
all
assaults
to
bear
till
time
to
dust
their
frames
should
wear
a
wood
like
that
enchanted
grove
in
which
with
fiends
rinaldo
strove
where
every
silent
tree
possessed
a
spirit
prisoned
in
its
breast
which
the
first
stroke
of
coming
strife
would
startle
into
hideous
life
so
dense
so
still
the
austrians
stood
a
living
wall
a
human
wood
impregnable
their
front
appears
all
horrent
with
projected
spears
whose
polished
points
before
them
shine
from
flank
to
flank
one
brilliant
line
bright
as
the
breakers
splendors
run
along
the
billows
to
the
sun
opposed
to
these
a
hovering
band
contended
for
their
native
land
peasants
whose
strength
had
broke
from
manly
necks
the
ignoble
yoke
and
forged
their
fetters
into
swords
on
equal
terms
to
fight
their
lords
and
what
insurgent
rage
had
gained
in
many
a
mortal
fray
maintained
marshaled
at
morn
at
freedom
call
they
come
to
conquer
or
to
fall
where
he
who
conquered
he
who
fell
was
deemed
a
dead
or
living
tell
such
virtue
had
that
patriot
breathed
so
to
the
soil
his
soul
bequeathed
that
his
arrows
flew
heroes
in
his
own
likeness
grew
and
warriors
sprang
from
every
sod
which
his
awakening
footstep
trod
and
now
the
work
of
life
and
death
hung
on
the
passing
of
a
breath
the
fire
of
conflict
burnt
within
the
battle
trembled
to
begin
yet
while
the
austrians
held
their
ground
point
for
attack
was
nowhere
found
the
impatient
switzers
gazed
the
unbroken
line
of
lances
blazed
that
line
suicide
to
meet
and
perish
at
their
tyrant
feet
how
could
they
rest
within
their
graves
and
leave
their
homes
the
homes
of
slaves
would
they
not
feel
their
children
tread
with
clanging
chains
above
their
head
it
must
not
this
day
this
hour
annihilates
the
oppressor
power
all
switzerland
is
in
the
field
she
will
not
fly
she
can
not
yield
she
must
not
fall
her
better
fate
here
gives
her
an
immortal
date
few
were
the
numbers
she
could
boast
but
every
freeman
was
a
host
and
felt
as
though
himself
were
he
on
whose
sole
arm
hung
victory
it
did
depend
on
one
indeed
behold
him
arnold
winkelried
there
sounds
not
to
the
tramp
of
fame
the
echo
of
a
nobler
name
unmarked
he
stood
amid
the
throng
in
rumination
deep
and
long
till
you
might
see
with
sudden
grace
the
very
thought
come
his
face
and
by
the
motion
of
his
form
anticipate
the
coming
storm
and
by
the
uplifting
of
his
brow
tell
where
the
bolt
would
strike
and
how
but
was
no
sooner
thought
and
done
the
field
was
in
a
moment
won
make
way
for
liberty
he
cried
then
ran
with
arms
extended
wide
as
if
his
dearest
friend
to
clasp
ten
spears
he
swept
within
his
grasp
make
way
for
liberty
he
cried
their
keen
points
met
from
side
to
side
he
bowed
among
them
like
a
tree
and
thus
made
way
for
liberty
swift
to
the
breach
his
comrades
fly
make
way
for
liberty
they
cry
and
through
the
austrian
phalanx
dart
as
rushed
the
spears
through
arnold
heart
while
instantaneous
as
his
fall
rout
ruin
panic
scattered
all
an
earthquake
could
not
overthrow
a
city
with
a
surer
blow
thus
switzerland
again
was
free
thus
death
made
way
for
liberty
in
the
next
fifty
years
the
swiss
were
engaged
in
a
war
with
austria
and
another
with
france
and
in
both
cases
they
were
victorious
but
while
they
were
exhausted
by
the
incessant
wars
that
had
been
urged
upon
them
they
were
threatened
with
a
more
formidable
invasion
than
ever
charles
the
bold
duke
of
burgundy
resolved
to
attach
switzerland
to
his
domain
crossing
the
jura
the
duke
found
himself
in
possession
of
yverdun
it
having
been
betrayed
into
his
hands
but
the
citadel
still
held
out
charles
irritated
that
his
progress
should
be
stayed
by
such
a
handful
of
men
offered
to
let
them
retire
home
if
they
would
surrender
but
if
they
still
held
out
he
would
hang
them
all
the
swiss
knowing
prolonged
defense
was
useless
surrendered
as
they
marched
out
of
the
citadel
they
were
seized
by
order
of
the
duke
and
all
murdered
aroused
by
these
horrors
an
army
of
twenty
thousand
advanced
to
meet
the
duke
at
the
head
of
three
times
that
number
in
the
battle
that
ensued
the
burgundians
were
entirely
defeated
and
charles
narrowly
escaped
with
his
life
writhing
under
his
disgrace
and
vowing
revenge
the
duke
raised
a
much
more
numerous
army
and
again
invaded
switzerland
he
advanced
by
the
way
of
the
lake
of
neufchatel
and
paused
a
few
days
to
capture
the
fortress
on
the
banks
of
lake
morat
while
the
siege
was
going
on
the
swiss
army
concentrated
and
marched
to
meet
their
foes
thirty
thousand
men
were
to
fight
the
battle
of
freedom
against
one
hundred
thousand
it
was
on
saturday
june
the
weather
was
threatening
the
sky
overcast
and
rain
fell
in
torrents
a
vanguard
was
formed
commanded
by
john
hallwyl
who
knelt
and
besought
a
blessing
from
on
high
while
they
yet
prayed
the
sun
broke
through
the
clouds
upon
which
the
swiss
commander
rose
sword
in
hand
crying
up
up
heaven
smiles
on
our
victory
the
artillery
thundered
forth
as
he
spoke
and
the
whole
plain
from
the
lake
to
the
rocky
heights
became
one
vast
toward
the
main
body
of
the
burgundians
the
swiss
army
poured
down
with
irresistible
force
and
courage
and
clearing
all
difficulties
they
reached
the
line
of
the
enemy
a
fearful
slaughter
now
ensued
the
burgundians
were
utterly
vanquished
the
haughty
duke
pale
and
dispirited
fled
with
a
few
followers
and
never
stopped
till
he
reached
the
banks
of
lake
leman
the
rout
was
so
complete
that
many
of
the
burgundians
in
terror
and
despair
threw
themselves
into
the
lake
of
morat
the
banks
of
which
were
strewed
with
the
bodies
of
the
slain
the
battle
of
morat
lives
in
history
with
the
victories
of
marathon
and
bannockburn
in
each
freedom
for
the
nation
was
secured
and
liberty
for
man
was
preserved
and
transmitted
as
a
deed
the
swiss
victory
for
ever
freed
a
people
from
a
grasping
foreign
tyrant
and
it
is
a
matter
of
rejoicing
to
all
who
love
liberty
till
and
like
other
great
events
it
is
the
subject
of
national
traditions
according
to
one
of
these
a
young
native
of
friburg
who
had
been
engaged
in
the
battle
keenly
desirous
of
being
the
first
to
carry
home
tidings
of
the
victory
ran
the
whole
way
a
distance
of
ten
or
twelve
miles
and
with
such
overhaste
that
on
his
arrival
at
the
he
dropped
with
fatigue
and
barely
able
to
shout
that
the
swiss
were
victorious
immediately
expired
a
twig
of
which
he
carried
in
his
hand
was
planted
on
the
spot
in
commemoration
of
this
event
and
till
the
present
day
are
seen
in
the
of
friburg
the
aged
and
remains
of
the
venerable
tree
which
grew
from
this
twig
in
most
of
the
towns
of
switzerland
a
tree
of
liberty
is
preserved
which
came
from
scions
of
the
original
tree
at
friburg
chapter
iv
and
six
hundred
years
ago
the
duty
of
defending
freedom
fell
to
king
robert
bruce
and
the
scotch
and
this
is
how
it
happened
the
time
was
during
the
crusades
when
all
europe
was
marching
to
the
east
and
engaging
in
battle
with
the
moslems
scotland
had
been
an
independent
country
for
many
years
but
some
of
her
princes
were
too
weak
for
those
troublous
times
the
witches
that
deceived
macbeth
seem
to
have
cast
a
spell
upon
the
prosperity
of
the
country
clan
was
at
enmity
with
clan
and
one
great
chieftain
waged
relentless
war
with
another
the
fierce
nobles
paid
little
heed
to
the
king
and
showed
no
regard
for
the
rights
of
the
people
it
seemed
that
peace
and
liberty
had
departed
forever
alexander
iii
died
leaving
no
direct
heir
the
scottish
nobles
assembled
to
elect
who
should
be
their
king
the
choice
lay
between
robert
bruce
and
john
balliol
as
the
nobles
could
not
agree
the
matter
was
referred
to
king
edward
i
of
england
who
decided
in
favor
of
balliol
the
new
prince
was
weak
and
when
he
resented
the
interference
of
king
edward
in
some
of
his
affairs
he
was
easily
defeated
and
driven
from
the
kingdom
scotland
was
now
regarded
as
a
conquered
country
and
the
people
were
terribly
oppressed
the
nobles
were
deprived
of
their
estates
and
the
poor
people
were
taxed
to
the
verge
of
starvation
for
fifteen
years
king
edward
held
on
to
his
usurped
power
while
the
weak
king
balliol
was
wandering
in
foreign
lands
paying
no
attention
to
the
distracted
state
of
his
country
at
last
the
oppression
became
so
great
that
conflicts
took
place
almost
daily
between
the
scotch
peasants
and
the
english
soldiery
on
one
occasion
a
young
man
named
william
wallace
was
out
with
a
boy
to
carry
the
fish
two
or
three
english
soldiers
came
along
and
insisted
on
taking
the
fish
wallace
offered
to
divide
with
them
but
they
insisted
on
taking
the
whole
when
he
flew
in
a
rage
killed
one
with
his
and
seizing
a
sword
put
the
others
to
flight
he
then
fled
and
concealed
himself
in
the
mountains
until
the
matter
blew
over
on
another
occasion
he
killed
an
englishman
who
insulted
him
at
a
fair
and
fled
to
his
home
where
he
was
pursued
by
the
soldiers
he
escaped
by
the
back
door
but
the
cruel
english
leader
hazelrigg
put
his
wife
and
servants
to
death
from
that
time
wallace
devoted
himself
to
fighting
the
english
he
soon
collected
a
band
of
outlaws
and
attacked
the
english
whereever
he
found
a
favorable
opportunity
he
soon
had
the
satisfaction
of
killing
hazelrigg
and
of
capturing
many
important
places
the
scotch
rose
everywhere
and
joined
wallace
who
soon
found
himself
at
the
head
of
a
formidable
army
with
this
lie
captured
the
english
fortresses
and
finally
defeated
the
chief
english
army
under
earl
warren
scotland
was
now
free
but
the
english
king
hastened
back
from
flanders
to
punish
the
scotch
the
battle
of
falkirk
was
fought
july
and
the
scotch
were
entirely
defeated
wallace
again
became
a
fugitive
but
was
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
edward
and
was
beheaded
and
quartered
according
to
the
barbarous
custom
of
the
times
the
eyes
of
all
scotland
were
now
turned
to
robert
bruce
as
the
only
remaining
champion
who
would
be
likely
to
make
head
against
the
english
and
he
accepted
the
proffered
leadership
his
principal
rival
was
a
powerful
noble
called
the
red
comyn
and
with
this
rival
bruce
sought
to
make
friends
the
two
met
in
a
church
and
comyn
flatly
refused
to
join
the
scottish
cause
but
openly
proclaimed
his
adherence
to
the
english
a
quarrel
arose
and
in
the
excitement
bruce
stabbed
comyn
almost
paralyzed
at
his
act
he
rushed
out
of
the
house
and
called
for
his
horse
his
friends
eagerly
inquired
what
was
the
matter
i
doubt
said
bruce
that
i
have
slain
the
red
comyn
do
not
leave
the
matter
in
doubt
said
kirkpatrick
i
will
make
it
certain
he
and
his
companions
then
rushed
into
the
church
and
soon
dispatched
comyn
with
their
daggers
this
deed
is
the
one
great
blot
upon
the
name
of
bruce
and
bitterly
did
he
repent
of
his
rashness
it
called
down
upon
his
devoted
head
the
anathema
of
the
church
for
sacrilege
in
committing
violence
before
the
holy
altar
it
arrayed
against
him
the
kinsmen
and
friends
of
the
red
comyn
and
it
produced
distrust
in
the
minds
of
many
true
friends
of
scotland
who
could
never
have
confidence
in
such
an
impetuous
leader
bruce
made
a
vow
that
if
he
succeeded
in
securing
the
freedom
of
scotland
he
would
do
penance
for
his
crime
by
entering
upon
a
crusade
and
fighting
for
the
holy
sepulchre
on
the
of
march
bruce
was
crowned
king
his
enemies
immediately
attacked
and
defeated
him
and
he
was
obliged
to
take
refuge
in
the
mountains
of
the
highlands
here
he
was
hunted
like
a
wild
animal
and
was
obliged
to
flee
from
one
fastness
to
another
one
of
the
most
malignant
of
his
enemies
was
lord
lorn
a
kinsman
of
the
red
comyn
at
one
time
bruce
and
his
few
followers
were
retreating
through
a
narrow
pass
when
he
was
set
upon
by
lorn
and
a
much
superior
force
sending
his
followers
ahead
he
stopped
his
horse
in
the
narrow
way
and
covered
their
retreat
upon
seeing
the
king
thus
alone
three
powerful
highlandmen
a
father
and
two
sons
set
upon
him
determined
to
kill
him
or
take
him
prisoner
for
their
master
lord
lorn
bruce
struck
the
first
man
who
came
up
and
seized
his
bridle
such
a
blow
with
his
sword
as
to
cut
off
his
hand
and
free
the
bridle
the
man
bled
to
death
the
other
brother
seized
him
by
the
leg
and
attempted
to
throw
him
from
his
horse
the
king
setting
spurs
to
the
horse
made
the
animal
spring
forward
so
that
the
highlander
fell
under
the
horse
feet
and
as
he
endeavored
to
rise
the
king
cleft
his
head
in
two
with
his
sword
the
father
seeing
his
two
sons
thus
slain
flew
at
bruce
and
grasped
him
in
his
mantle
so
close
to
his
body
that
he
could
not
have
room
to
wield
his
long
sword
but
with
an
iron
hammer
which
hung
at
his
bruce
dashed
out
the
brains
of
this
new
assailant
the
dying
man
still
clung
to
the
king
mantle
so
that
to
get
free
bruce
was
obliged
to
undo
the
brooch
by
which
it
was
fastened
and
leave
it
with
the
mantle
behind
this
brooch
fell
into
the
hands
of
lorn
and
was
kept
in
the
family
for
many
generations
as
a
memorial
of
bruce
but
bruce
was
soon
reduced
to
greater
straits
and
without
followers
was
obliged
to
conceal
himself
in
stables
and
caves
in
all
his
misfortunes
he
never
gave
up
the
cause
of
his
country
and
he
sacredly
devoted
his
life
to
the
freedom
of
scotland
after
one
of
his
defeats
he
was
lying
one
night
on
a
wretched
bed
in
a
rude
hut
while
debating
in
his
own
mind
whether
it
were
not
best
to
enlist
in
a
crusade
when
his
attention
was
directed
to
a
spider
on
the
rafters
overhead
he
saw
that
the
little
spinner
was
trying
to
swing
from
one
rafter
to
another
so
as
to
fix
his
thread
across
the
space
time
and
again
it
tried
and
failed
admiring
the
perseverance
of
the
creature
bruce
began
to
count
the
number
of
times
he
tried
one
two
three
four
five
six
it
suddenly
occurred
to
bruce
that
this
was
just
the
number
of
times
he
had
failed
in
his
attempts
against
the
enemy
he
then
made
up
his
mind
that
if
the
spider
succeeded
in
the
next
trial
he
would
make
one
more
endeavor
to
recover
his
kingdom
but
if
it
failed
he
would
start
at
once
for
palestine
the
spider
sprang
into
the
air
and
this
time
succeeded
so
the
king
resolved
upon
another
trial
and
never
after
met
with
a
defeat
illustration
many
a
wild
story
is
told
of
his
feats
of
arms
and
hairbreadth
escapes
while
he
wandered
about
without
a
country
sir
walter
scott
in
his
poem
the
lord
of
the
isles
records
one
of
these
legends
it
is
reported
that
on
one
occasion
with
his
brother
edward
and
sister
isabel
in
a
boat
he
was
driven
by
stress
of
weather
to
take
refuge
in
one
of
the
hebrides
upon
the
western
coast
the
home
of
roland
the
lord
of
the
isles
it
happened
to
be
a
festive
occasion
a
large
assembly
having
met
to
celebrate
the
marriage
of
the
lord
of
the
isles
with
the
sister
of
the
lord
of
lorn
as

him
now
by

while
my

stood
the

with

and
scornful
brow
up
all
who
love

blow
on

and
lay
the
outlawed

low
then
waked
the
wild
debate
again
with
brawling
threat
and
clamor
vain
vassals
and
menials
thronging
in
lent
their
brute
rage
to
swell
the
din
when
far
and
wide
a
bugle
clang
from
the
dark
ocean
upward
rang
the
abbot
comes
they
cried
at
once
the
holy
man
whose

met
him
on

beside

in

in

his

glistening

his

he
said
our

from

but
what
means
this
no

is
here
do
dirks
unsheathed
suit

or
are
these
naked
brands
a
seemly
show
for
churchman
sight
when
he
comes
summoned
to
unite
betrothed
hearts
and
hands
then
cloaking
hate
with
fiery
zeal
proud
lorn
answered
the
appeal
thou

he
waked
a

in

and
now
as

bruce
remained
for
some
months
while
his
friends
were
making
preparations
for
a
rising
upon
the
mainland
at
last
the
time
came
and
bruce
at
the
head
of
a
little
force
landed
in
the
night
and
surprised
and
captured
a
castle
held
by
the
lord
of
lorn
holding
this
as
a
basis
of
operations
the
king
and
his
principal
followers
douglas
and
randolph
went
out
in
different
directions
to
arouse
the
people
against
their
english
oppressors
and
to
raise
forces
of
sufficient
strength
to
risk
their
cause
in
battle
this
was
a
matter
of
great
hazard
as
every
movement
of
the
scotch
was
closely
watched
by
the
enemy
and
when
any
one
was
suspected
of
opposing
the
english
rule
he
was
at
once
imprisoned
and
probably
executed
the
patriots
were
obliged
to
move
with
great
caution
and
often
to
secrete
themselves
in
the
fastnesses
of
the
mountains
or
in
the
lonely
huts
of
the
peasants
were
employed
to
track
the
fugitives
and
it
is
related
that
lorn
at
one
time
followed
bruce
with
a
that
had
once
been
his
own
the
king
seeing
that
he
was
followed
by
a
large
body
of
soldiers
divided
his
men
into
three
separate
parties
hoping
to
throw
the
hound
off
the
track
the
when
he
came
to
the
point
of
separation
would
not
even
notice
the
two
other
divisions
but
followed
that
of
the
king
finding
his
last
expedient
had
failed
bruce
ordered
his
whole
party
to
disperse
keeping
with
him
only
his
as
an
attendant
when
lorn
discovered
the
party
had
broken
up
he
sent
five
of
his
men
who
were
speedy
on
foot
to
follow
the
king
and
put
him
to
death
they
ran
so
fast
that
they
soon
gained
sight
of
bruce
and
his
companion
the
two
turned
upon
the
five
men
of
lorn
who
came
up
one
by
one
exhausted
with
running
and
put
them
all
to
death
by
this
time
bruce
was
much
fatigued
but
he
dared
not
stop
to
rest
for
he
could
hear
every
moment
the
deep
bay
of
the
hound
at
length
they
came
to
a
wood
through
which
ran
a
small
stream
of
water
into
the
stream
they
waded
and
followed
it
for
a
long
distance
the
followed
the
track
to
the
water
but
he
could
trace
the
scent
no
farther
and
lorn
gave
up
the
chase
but
bruce
adventures
were
not
at
an
end
after
resting
themselves
in
the
woods
the
two
set
out
to
find
some
human
habitation
or
to
fall
in
with
some
party
of
their
friends
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
they
met
three
men
who
looked
like
ruffians
they
were
well
armed
and
one
of
them
bore
a
sheep
on
his
back
which
it
seemed
he
had
just
stolen
they
saluted
the
king
civilly
and
he
replying
to
their
salutation
asked
them
where
they
were
going
the
men
answered
that
they
were
seeking
for
robert
bruce
for
they
intended
to
join
him
the
king
answered
that
if
they
would
go
with
him
he
would
conduct
them
where
they
could
find
the
scottish
king
then
the
man
who
had
spoken
changed
color
and
bruce
who
looked
sharply
at
him
began
to
suspect
that
the
ruffian
guessed
who
he
was
and
that
he
and
his
companions
had
some
design
against
his
person
in
order
to
gain
the
reward
which
had
been
offered
for
his
life
so
he
said
to
them
good
friends
as
we
are
not
well
acquainted
with
each
other
you
must
go
before
us
and
we
will
follow
near
to
you
have
no
occasion
to
suspect
any
harm
from
us
said
the
man
do
i
suspect
any
said
bruce
i
but
this
is
the
way
it
which
i
choose
to
travel
the
men
did
as
he
commanded
and
thus
they
traveled
till
they
came
to
a
waste
and
ruinous
cottage
where
the
men
proposed
to
dress
down
part
of
the
sheep
which
they
were
carrying
the
king
was
glad
to
hear
of
food
but
he
insisted
that
two
fires
should
be
kindled
one
for
himself
and
at
one
end
of
the
cottage
the
other
at
the
other
end
for
the
three
companions
the
men
did
as
he
desired
they
broiled
a
quarter
of
the
mutton
for
themselves
and
gave
another
to
the
king
and
his
attendant
they
were
obliged
to
eat
it
without
bread
or
salt
but
as
they
were
very
hungry
they
were
glad
to
get
food
in
any
shape
and
partook
of
it
heartily
then
so
heavy
a
drowsiness
fell
on
king
robert
that
he
greatly
desired
to
sleep
but
first
he
desired
his
to
watch
as
he
slept
for
he
had
great
suspicion
of
his
new
acquaintances
his
promised
to
keep
awake
and
did
his
best
to
so
keep
his
word
but
the
king
had
not
been
long
asleep
ere
his
fell
into
a
deep
slumber
also
for
he
had
as
much
fatigue
as
the
king
when
the
three
villains
saw
the
king
and
his
attendant
were
asleep
they
made
signs
to
each
other
and
rising
up
at
once
drew
their
swords
with
the
purpose
to
kill
them
both
but
the
king
slept
but
lightly
and
as
little
noise
as
the
traitors
made
in
rising
he
was
awakened
by
it
and
starting
up
drew
his
sword
and
went
to
meet
them
at
the
same
moment
he
pushed
his
with
his
foot
to
awaken
him
and
he
started
up
but
ere
he
got
his
eyes
cleared
to
see
what
was
about
him
one
of
the
ruffians
that
were
advancing
to
slay
the
king
killed
him
with
the
stroke
of
a
sword
the
king
was
now
alone
one
man
against
three
and
in
the
greatest
danger
of
his
life
but
his
amazing
strength
and
the
good
armor
which
he
wore
freed
him
from
this
great
danger
and
he
killed
the
men
one
by
one
king
robert
was
now
alone
and
he
left
the
cottage
very
sorrowful
for
the
death
of
his
and
took
himself
in
the
direction
toward
where
he
had
directed
his
men
to
ensemble
after
their
dispersion
it
was
now
near
night
and
the
place
of
meeting
being
a
he
went
boldly
into
it
where
he
found
the
mistress
an
old
scotchwoman
sitting
alone
upon
seeing
a
stranger
enter
she
asked
him
who
and
what
he
was
the
king
answered
that
he
was
a
traveler
who
was
journeying
through
the
country
travelers
answered
the
good
woman
welcome
here
for
the
sake
of
one
who
is
that
one
said
the
king
whose
sake
you
make
all
travelers
welcome
is
our
lawful
king
robert
the
bruce
answered
the
mistress
is
the
rightful
lord
of
this
country
and
although
he
is
now
pursued
and
hunted
after
with
hounds
and
horns
i
hope
to
live
to
see
him
king
over
all
scotland
you
love
him
so
well
dame
said
the
king
that
you
see
him
before
you
i
am
robert
the
bruce
said
the
good
woman
in
great
surprise
wherefore
are
you
thus
alone
where
are
all
your
men
have
none
with
me
at
this
moment
answered
the
bruce
therefore
i
must
travel
alone
that
shall
not
be
said
the
brave
old
dame
i
have
two
stout
sons
gallant
and
trusty
men
who
shall
be
your
servants
for
life
and
death
so
she
brought
her
sons
and
though
she
well
knew
the
danger
to
which
she
exposed
them
she
made
them
swear
fealty
to
the
king
and
they
afterward
became
high
officers
in
his
service
now
the
loyal
old
woman
was
getting
everything
ready
for
the
king
supper
when
suddenly
there
was
a
trampling
of
horse
heard
around
the
house
they
thought
it
must
be
some
of
the
english
or
john
of
lorn
men
and
the
good
wife
called
upon
her
sons
to
fight
to
the
last
for
king
robert
but
shortly
after
the
voices
of
james
of
douglas
and
of
edward
brute
the
king
brother
were
heard
who
had
come
with
a
hundred
and
fifty
horsemen
to
this
according
to
the
instructions
of
the
king
when
they
parted
robert
the
bruce
was
right
joyful
to
meet
his
brother
and
faithful
friend
lord
james
and
had
no
sooner
found
himself
at
the
head
of
such
a
considerable
body
of
followers
than
forgetting
hunger
and
weariness
he
began
to
inquire
where
the
enemy
who
had
pursued
him
so
long
had
taken
up
their
quarters
said
he
they
must
suppose
we
are
totally
scattered
and
fled
it
is
likely
they
will
think
themselves
quite
secure
and
disperse
themselves
into
distant
quarters
and
keep
careless
watch
is
very
true
answered
james
of
douglas
i
passed
a
village
where
there
are
two
hundred
of
them
quartered
who
had
placed
no
sentinels
and
if
you
have
a
mind
to
make
haste
we
may
surprise
them
this
very
night
then
there
was
nothing
but
mount
and
ride
and
as
the
scots
came
by
surprise
on
the
body
of
the
english
whom
douglas
had
mentioned
and
rushed
suddenly
into
the
village
where
they
were
quartered
they
easily
dispersed
and
cut
them
to
pieces
thus
doing
their
pursuers
more
injury
than
they
themselves
had
received
during
the
long
and
severe
pursuit
of
the
preceding
day
on
another
occasion
bruce
with
sixty
men
was
wandering
in
the
county
of
galloway
awaiting
the
gathering
of
forces
now
the
people
of
galloway
are
mostly
friendly
to
the
lord
of
lorn
and
a
large
number
of
them
collected
determined
to
capture
him
they
felt
sure
of
the
success
of
their
enterprise
as
they
had
a
to
track
the
king
and
had
such
superior
numbers
now
bruce
who
was
always
watchful
and
vigilant
had
received
some
information
of
this
party
to
come
upon
him
suddenly
in
the
night
accordingly
he
quartered
his
party
of
sixty
men
on
the
farther
side
of
a
deep
and
river
that
had
very
steep
and
rocky
banks
there
was
but
one
ford
by
which
this
river
could
be
crossed
in
the
neighborhood
and
that
ford
was
deep
and
narrow
so
that
two
men
could
scarcely
get
through
abreast
the
bank
on
which
they
were
to
land
on
the
other
side
was
steep
and
the
path
that
led
upward
from
the
water
edge
extremely
narrow
and
difficult
bruce
caused
his
men
to
lie
down
and
sleep
at
a
place
about
half
a
mile
distant
from
the
river
while
he
with
two
attendants
went
down
to
watch
the
ford
and
thinking
how
easy
the
enemy
might
be
kept
from
passing
there
providing
it
was
bravely
defended
when
he
heard
the
distant
baying
of
a
hound
which
was
always
coming
nearer
and
nearer
this
was
the
which
was
tracing
the
king
steps
to
the
ford
where
he
had
crossed
and
the
two
hundred
galloway
men
were
along
with
the
animal
and
guided
by
it
bruce
thought
of
going
back
to
awaken
his
men
but
then
he
thought
it
might
be
some
shepherd
dog
men
said
he
sorely
tired
i
will
not
disturb
them
by
the
barking
of
a
cur
till
i
know
something
more
of
the
matter
so
he
stood
and
listened
and
by
and
by
as
the
cry
of
the
hound
came
nearer
he
began
to
hear
the
trampling
of
horses
and
the
voices
of
men
and
the
ringing
and
clattering
of
armor
and
then
he
was
sure
the
enemy
were
coming
to
the
then
the
king
thought
i
go
back
to
give
my
men
the
alarm
these
galloway
men
will
get
through
the
ford
without
opposition
and
that
would
be
a
pity
since
it
is
a
place
so
advantageous
to
make
a
defense
against
them
so
he
looked
again
at
the
steep
path
and
the
deep
river
and
he
thought
it
gave
him
so
much
advantage
that
he
could
defend
the
passage
with
his
own
hand
until
his
men
came
to
assist
him
his
armor
was
so
good
and
strong
that
he
had
no
fears
of
their
arrows
and
therefore
the
combat
was
not
so
very
unequal
as
it
must
have
otherwise
seemed
he
therefore
sent
his
followers
to
waken
his
men
and
remained
alone
on
the
bank
of
the
river
in
the
meanwhile
the
noise
and
the
trampling
of
the
horses
increased
and
the
moon
being
bright
bruce
saw
the
glancing
arms
of
about
two
hundred
men
who
came
down
to
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
the
men
of
galloway
on
their
part
saw
but
one
solitary
figure
guarding
the
ford
and
the
foremost
of
them
plunged
into
the
river
without
minding
him
bruce
who
stood
high
above
them
on
the
bank
where
they
were
to
land
killed
the
foremost
man
with
a
thrust
of
his
long
spear
and
with
a
second
thrust
stabbed
the
horse
which
fell
down
kicking
and
plunging
in
his
agonies
on
the
narrow
path
and
so
preventing
the
others
from
getting
out
of
the
river
in
the
confusion
five
or
six
of
the
enemy
were
slain
or
having
been
borne
down
the
current
were
drowned
in
the
river
the
rest
were
terrified
and
drew
back
but
when
they
looked
again
and
saw
only
one
man
they
themselves
being
so
many
they
cried
out
that
their
honor
would
be
lost
forever
if
they
did
not
force
their
way
and
encouraged
each
other
with
loud
cries
to
plunge
in
and
assault
him
but
by
this
time
the
soldiers
came
up
to
his
assistance
and
the
galloway
men
retreated
and
gave
up
their
enterprise
these
successes
of
bruce
inspired
great
confidence
and
he
soon
found
himself
at
the
head
of
a
formidable
force
with
this
he
marched
up
and
down
the
country
and
compelled
the
english
to
keep
strictly
within
their
castles
and
fortified
places
and
even
several
of
these
were
captured
king
edward
i
of
england
heard
of
these
successes
of
bruce
with
astonishment
and
rage
though
old
and
sorely
diseased
he
raised
a
large
army
and
marched
for
the
north
but
he
had
scarcely
crossed
the
scottish
border
when
his
physician
informed
him
that
he
had
but
a
few
hours
to
live
he
immediately
called
his
son
to
his
and
made
him
swear
that
he
would
push
forward
this
expedition
against
the
bruce
and
he
died
cursing
the
whole
scotch
people
he
even
gave
direction
that
his
body
should
be
boiled
and
that
his
bones
wrapped
in
a
bull
hide
should
be
carried
at
the
head
of
the
army
as
often
as
the
scots
attempted
to
recover
their
freedom
edward
ii
was
a
weak
prince
neither
so
wise
nor
so
brave
as
his
father
he
marched
a
little
way
on
to
scotland
but
having
no
great
liking
for
war
he
turned
and
marched
back
into
england
he
disregarded
his
father
injunction
about
the
disposition
of
his
bones
but
took
them
back
to
london
and
deposited
them
in
westminster
abbey
from
this
time
the
cause
of
bruce
was
a
succession
of
victories
during
the
winter
and
spring
one
english
fortress
after
another
surrendered
until
there
only
remained
the
strong
castle
of
stirling
held
by
the
english
power
this
castle
was
besieged
and
sir
philip
mowbray
the
commander
agreed
to
surrender
it
if
it
was
not
reinforced
by
the
english
before
midsummer
then
came
a
cessation
of
hostilities
and
a
period
of
rest
for
the
scots
king
edward
had
made
no
arrangement
to
again
interfere
in
scottish
affairs
but
now
when
sir
philip
mowbray
the
governor
of
stirling
came
to
london
to
tell
the
king
that
stirling
the
last
scottish
town
of
importance
which
remained
in
possession
of
the
english
was
to
be
surrendered
if
it
were
not
relieved
by
force
of
arms
before
midsummer
then
all
the
english
nobles
called
out
it
would
be
a
sin
and
shame
to
permit
the
fair
conquest
which
edward
i
had
made
to
be
forfeited
to
the
scots
for
want
of
fighting
it
was
therefore
resolved
that
the
king
should
go
himself
to
scotland
with
as
great
forces
as
he
could
possibly
muster
king
edward
ii
therefore
assembled
one
of
the
greatest
armies
which
a
king
of
england
ever
commanded
there
were
troops
brought
from
all
his
dominions
many
brave
soldiers
from
the
french
provinces
which
the
king
of
england
enjoyed
in
france
many
irish
many
welsh
and
all
the
great
english
nobles
and
barons
with
their
followers
were
assembled
in
one
great
army
the
number
was
not
less
than
one
hundred
thousand
men
king
robert
the
bruce
summoned
all
his
nobles
and
barons
to
join
him
when
he
heard
of
the
great
preparation
which
the
king
of
england
was
making
they
were
not
so
numerous
as
the
english
by
many
thousand
men
in
fact
his
whole
army
did
not
very
much
exceed
thirty
thousand
men
and
they
were
much
worse
armed
than
the
wealthy
englishmen
but
then
robert
who
was
at
their
head
was
one
of
the
most
expert
generals
of
the
time
and
the
officers
he
had
under
him
were
his
brother
edward
his
nephew
randolph
his
faithful
follower
the
douglas
and
other
brave
and
experienced
leaders
who
commanded
the
same
men
that
had
been
accustomed
to
fight
and
gain
victories
under
every
disadvantage
of
situation
and
numbers
the
king
on
his
part
studied
how
he
might
supply
by
address
and
stratagem
what
he
wanted
in
numbers
and
strength
he
knew
the
superiority
of
the
english
both
in
their
cavalry
which
were
much
better
mounted
and
armed
than
those
of
the
scots
and
in
the
archery
in
which
art
the
english
were
better
than
any
people
in
the
world
both
these
advantages
he
resolved
to
provide
against
with
this
purpose
bruce
led
his
army
down
into
a
plain
near
stirling
called
the
park
near
which
and
beneath
it
the
english
army
must
needs
pass
through
a
boggy
country
broken
with
while
the
scots
occupied
hard
dry
ground
he
then
caused
all
the
hard
ground
upon
the
front
of
his
line
of
battle
where
cavalry
were
likely
to
act
to
be
dug
full
of
holes
about
as
deep
as
a
man
knee
they
were
filled
with
light
brushwood
and
the
turf
was
laid
on
the
top
so
that
it
appeared
a
plain
field
while
in
reality
it
was
all
as
full
of
these
pits
as
a
honeycomb
is
of
holes
he
also
it
is
said
caused
steel
spikes
called
calthrops
to
be
scattered
up
and
down
in
the
plain
where
the
english
cavalry
were
most
likely
to
advance
trusting
to
lame
and
destroy
their
horses
when
his
army
was
drawn
the
line
stretched
north
and
south
on
the
south
it
was
terminated
by
the
banks
of
the

and
expressed
his
determination
to

to
lose

desired
that
all

before

when
the
main
body
of
his
army
was
thus
placed
in
order
the
king
posted
randolph
with
a
body
of
horse
near
to
the
church
of
mirau
commanding
him
to
use
the
utmost
diligence
to
prevent
any
succorers
from
being
thrown
into
stirling
castle
he
then
dismissed
james
of
douglas
and
sir
robert
keith
the
marshal
of
the
scottish
army
in
order
that
they
might
survey
as
nearly
as
they
could
the
english
force
which
was
now
approaching
from
falkirk
they
returned
with
information
that
the
approach
of
that
vast
host
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
terrible
sights
which
could
be
seen
that
the
whole
country
seemed
covered
with
on
horse
and
foot
that
the
number
of
standard
banners
and
pennants
made
so
gallant
a
show
that
the
bravest
and
most
numerous
host
in
christendom
might
be
alarmed
to
see
king
edward
moving
against
them
it
was
upon
the
of
june
that
the
king
of
scotland
heard
the
news
that
the
english
army
were
approaching
stirling
he
drew
out
his
army
therefore
in
the
order
which
he
had
before
resolved
upon
after
a
short
time
bruce
who
was
looking
out
anxiously
for
the
enemy
saw
a
body
of
english
cavalry
trying
to
get
into
stirling
from
the
eastward
this
was
the
lord
clifford
who
with
a
chosen
body
of
eight
hundred
horse
had
been
detached
to
relieve
the
castle
see
randolph
said
the
king
to
his
nephew
there
is
a
rose
fallen
from
your
chaplet
by
this
be
meant
that
randolph
has
lost
some
honor
by
suffering
the
enemy
to
pass
where
he
had
been
commanded
to
follow
them
randolph
made
no
reply
but
rushed
against
clifford
with
little
more
than
half
his
number
the
scots
were
on
foot
the
english
turned
to
charge
them
with
their
lances
and
randolph
drew
up
his
men
in
close
order
to
receive
them
he
seemed
to
be
in
so
much
danger
that
douglas
asked
leave
of
the
king
to
go
and
assist
him
the
king
refused
permission
let
randolph
he
said
redeem
his
own
fault
i
can
not
break
the
order
of
battle
for
his
sake
still
the
danger
appeared
greater
and
the
english
horse
seemed
entirely
to
encompass
the
small
handful
of
scottish
infantry
to
please
you
said
douglas
to
the
king
my
heart
will
not
suffer
me
to
stand
idle
and
see
randolph
perish
i
must
go
to
his
assistance
he
rode
off
accordingly
but
long
before
they
had
reached
the
place
of
combat
they
saw
the
english
horses
galloping
off
many
with
their
empty
saddles
halt
said
douglas
to
his
men
randolph
has
gained
the
day
since
we
were
not
soon
enough
to
help
him
in
the
battle
do
not
let
us
lessen
his
glory
by
approaching
the
field
now
that
was
nobly
done
especially
as
douglas
and
randolph
were
always
contending
which
should
rise
highest
in
the
good
opinion
of
the
king
and
the
nation
the
van
of
the
english
army
now
came
in
sight
and
a
number
of
their
bravest
knights
drew
near
to
see
what
the
scottish
were
doing
they
saw
king
robert
dressed
in
his
armor
and
distinguished
by
a
gold
crown
which
he
wore
over
his
helmet
he
was
not
mounted
on
his
great
war
horse
because
he
did
not
expect
to
fight
that
evening
but
he
rode
on
a
little
pony
up
and
down
the
ranks
of
his
army
putting
his
men
in
order
and
carried
in
his
hand
a
short
made
of
steel
when
the
king
saw
the
english
horsemen
draw
near
he
advanced
a
little
before
his
own
men
that
he
might
look
at
them
more
nearly
there
was
a
knight
among
the
english
called
sir
henry
de
bohun
who
thought
this
would
be
a
good
opportunity
to
gain
great
fame
to
himself
and
put
an
end
to
the
war
by
killing
king
robert
the
king
being
poorly
mounted
and
having
no
lance
bohun
galloped
on
him
suddenly
and
furiously
thinking
with
his
long
spear
and
his
big
strong
horse
easily
to
bear
him
down
to
the
ground
king
robert
saw
him
and
permitted
him
to
come
very
near
then
suddenly
turned
his
pony
a
little
to
one
side
so
that
sir
henry
missed
him
with
the
lance
point
and
was
in
the
act
of
being
carried
past
him
by
the
career
of
his
horse
but
as
he
passed
king
robert
rose
up
in
his
stirrups
and
struck
sir
henry
on
the
head
with
his
so
terrible
a
blow
that
it
broke
to
pieces
his
iron
helmet
as
if
it
had
been
a
and
hurled
him
from
his
saddle
he
was
dead
before
he
reached
the
ground
this
gallant
action
was
blamed
by
the
scottish
leaders
who
thought
bruce
ought
not
to
have
exposed
himself
to
so
much
danger
when
the
safety
of
the
whole
army
depended
on
him
the
king
only
kept
looking
at
his
weapon
which
was
injured
by
the
force
of
the
blow
and
said
i
have
broken
my
good
this
is
the
way
scott
describes
this
incident
in
the
lord
of
the
isles
o
gay
yet
fearful
to
behold
flashing
with
steel
and
rough
with
gold
and
bristled
with
balls
and
spears
with
plumes
and
pennons
waving
fair
was
that
bright
battle
front
for
there
rode
england
king
and
peers
and
who
that
saw
that
monarch
ride
his
kingdom
battling
by
his
side
could
then
his
direful
doom
foretell
fair
was
his
seat
in
knightly
selle
and
in
his
sprightly
eye
was
set
some
sparks
of
the
plantagenet
though
bright
and
wandering
was
his
glance
it
flashed
at
sight
of
shield
and
lance
knowest

said
de

who
marshals
thus
their

the
audacious

were

but
horsed

still
must
the
rebel
dare
our
wrath
set
on
him
sweep
him
from
our
path
and
at
king
edward
signal
soon
dashed
from
the
ranks
sir
edward
bohun
of
hereford
high
blood
he
came
a
race
renowned
for
knightly
fame
he
burned
before
his
monarch
eye
to
do
some
deed
of
chivalry
he
spurred
his
steed
he
couched
his
lance
and
darted
on
the
bruce
at
once
as
motionless
as
rocks
that
bide
the
wrath
of
the
advancing
tide
the
bruce
stood
fast
each
breast
beat
high
and
dazzled
was
each
gazing
eye
the
heart
had
hardly
time
to
think
the
eyelid
scarce
had
time
to
wink
while
on
the
king
like
flash
of
flame
spurred
to
full
speed
the
came
the
partridge
may
the
falcon
mock
if
that
slight
palfrey
stand
the
shock
but
swerving
from
the
knight
career
just
as
they
met
bruce
shunned
the
spear
onward
the
baffled
warrior
bore
his
course
but
soon
his
course
was
high
in
his
stirrups
stood
the
king
and
gave
his
the
swing
right
on
de
bohun
the
whiles
he
passed
fell
that
stern
dint
the
first
the
last

blow

its
brazen

on

soon

sudden
fell
the
fierce
de
bohun
one
pitying
glance
the
monarch
shed
where
on
the
field
his
foe
lay
dead
then
gently
turned
his
palfrey
head
and
pacing
back
his
sober
way
slowly
he
gained
his
own
array
there
round
their
king
the
leaders
crowd
and
blame
his
recklessness
aloud
that
risked
each
adventurous
spear
a

so
valued

so
dear

next
morning
being
the
of
june
at
break
of
day
the
battle
began
in
terrible
earnest
the
english
as
they
advanced
saw
the
scots
getting
into
lines
the
abbot
of
inchaffray
walked
through
their
ranks
barefooted
and
exhorted
them
to
fight
for
their
freedom
they
kneeled
down
as
he
passed
and
prayed
to
heaven
for
victory
king
edward
who
saw
this
called
out
they
kneel
down
they
are
asking
forgiveness
yes
said
a
celebrated
english
baron
called
ingelram
de
umphraville
but
they
ask
it
from
god
not
from
us
these
men
will
conquer
or
die
upon
the
field
the
english
king
ordered
his
men
to
begin
the
battle
the
archers
then
bent
their
bows
and
began
to
shoot
so
closely
together
that
the
arrows
fell
like
flakes
of
snow
on
a
upon
the
right
behind
the
wood
each
by
his
steed
dismounted
stood
the
scottish
chivalry
with

fierce
edward

can
scarce
restrain
his
own
keen
heart
his
eager

until
the

cried
and
vaulting
from

bloody
plain
the
fine
english
cavalry
then
advanced
to
support
their
archers
and
to
attack
the
scottish
line
but
coming
over
the
ground
which
was
dug
full
of
pits
the
horses
fell
into
these
holes
and
the
riders
lay
tumbling
about
without
any
means
of
defense
and
unable
to
rise
from
the
weight
of
their
armor
the
englishmen
began
to
fall
into
general
disorder
and
the
scottish
king
bringing
up
more
of
his
forces
attacked
and
pressed
them
still
more
closely
on
a
sudden
an
event
happened
which
decided
the
victory
the
servants
and
attendants
on
the
scottish
camp
bad
been
sent
behind
the
army
to
a
place
called
gillies
hill
but
now
when
they
saw
that
their
masters
were
like
to
gain
the
day
they
rushed
from
their
place
of
concealment
with
such
weapons
as
they
could
get
that
they
might
have
their
share
in
the
victory
and
in
the
spoil
the
english
seeing
them
come
suddenly
over
the
hill
mistook
the
disorderly
rabble
for
a
new
army
coming
up
to
sustain
the
scots
and
losing
all
heart
began
to
shift
every
man
for
himself
edward
himself
left
the
field
as
fast
as
he
could
ride
and
was
closely
pursued
by
douglas
with
a
party
of
horse
who
followed
him
as
far
as
dunbar
where
the
english
had
still
a
friend
in
the
governor
patrick
earl
of
mans
the
earl
received
edward
in
his
forlorn
condition
and
furnished
him
with
a
fishing
skiff
or
small
ship
in
which
he
escaped
to
england
having
entirely
lost
his
fine
army
and
a
great
number
of
his
bravest
nobles
the
english
never
before
or
afterward
lost
so
dreadful
a
battle
as
that
of
bannockburn
nor
did
the
scots
ever
gain
one
of
the
same
importance
many
of
the
best
and
bravest
of
the
english
nobility
and
gentry
lay
dead
on
the
field
a
great
many
more
were
made
prisoners
and
the
whole
of
king
edward
immense
army
was
dispersed
or
destroyed
thus
did
robert
bruce
arise
from
the
condition
of
an
exile
hunted
with
like
a
stag
or
beast
of
prey
to
the
rank
of
an
independent
sovereign
universally
acknowledged
to
be
one
of
the
wisest
and
bravest
kings
who
then
lived
the
nation
of
scotland
was
also
raised
once
more
from
the
state
of
a
distressed
and
conquered
province
to
that
of
a
free
and
independent
state
governed
by
its
own
laws
and
subject
to
its
own
princes
and
although
the
country
was
after
the
bruce
death
often
subjected
to
great
loss
and
distress
both
by
the
hostility
of
the
english
and
by
the
unhappy
civil
wars
among
the
scots
themselves
yet
they
never
afterward
lost
the
freedom
for
which
wallace
had
laid
down
his
life
and
which
king
robert
had
recovered
no
less
by
his
wisdom
than
by
his
weapons
and
therefore
most
just
it
is
that
while
the
country
of
scotland
retains
any
recollection
of
its
history
the
memory
of
these
brave
warriors
and
faithful
patriots
ought
to
be
remembered
with
honor
and
gratitude
in
fourteen
years
after
the
battle
of
bannockburn
peace
was
concluded
between
england
and
scotland
in
which
the
english
surrendered
all
pretension
to
the
scottish
crown
king
robert
was
now
years
old
and
he
prepared
to
enter
upon
a
crusade
in
accordance
with
his
vow
and
in
expiation
of
his
offense
of
slaying
the
red
comyn
but
being
smitten
with
a
fatal
disease
he
directed
lord
james
of
douglas
upon
his
death
to
take
his
heart
and
carry
it
to
palestine
in
fulfillment
of
his
vow
douglas
accepted
the
sacred
trust
and
encased
the
heart
in
silver
and
hung
it
about
his
neck
on
his
way
to
the
holy
land
he
turned
aside
to
help
the
spaniard
in
a
campaign
against
the
moors
in
one
battle
being
sorely
beset
he
flung
the
heart
of
bruce
into
the
midst
of
the
enemy
and
followed
it
up
with
the
of
the
douglas
which
had
so
often
cheered
to
victory
among
his
native
hills

columbus

in
a
stirring
age
everywhere
light
was
breaking
in
after
centuries
of
darkness
and
all
europe
was
restless
with
suggestions
and
beginnings
of
new
life
great
men
were
plenty
rulers
like
the
medici
of

like

brought

the

that
later
set
the
world
agog
great
inventions
were
spreading

before
now
becoming
terribly
effective
through
the
improvement
in
guns
printing
suddenly
opening
knowledge
to
every
class
the
little
compass
with
which
mariners
were
just
beginning
to
trust
themselves
boldly
on
the
seas
in
spite
of
the
popular
impression
that
it
was
a
sort
of
infernal
machine
presided
over
by
the
devil
himself
illustration
ships
of
columbus
and
to
this
age
had
been
bequeathed
the
fascinating
stories
of
sir
john
mandeville
and
marco
polo
stories
to
make
every
boy
crazy
to
be
off
to
seek
his
fortune
from
their
travels
in
asia
these
men
had
brought
back
the
most
remarkable
accounts
of
the
eastern
lands
a
country
was
there
they
said
called
cathay
bordering
on
the
sea
it
was
ruled
by
an
emperor
the
kubla
khan
or
great
khan
who
lighted
his
bedroom
with
a
bright
jewel
half
a
foot
long
set
upon
golden
pillars
and
decorated
his
walls
with
wrought
gold
and
hundreds
of
precious
stones
the
rivers
of
the
land
were
crossed
by
marble
bridges
and
the
houses
were
roofed
and
paved
with
gold
the
seas
were
full
of
islands
where
spices
grew
and
countless
strange
creatures
lived
men
men
with
a
lip
long
enough
to
cover
their
whole
face
men
with
only
one
foot
but
that
so
large
that
they
held
it
over
them
like
an
umbrella
when
they
lay
down
in
the
sun
to
rest
men
and
men
with
no
heads
at
all
men
whose
only
food
was
snakes
and
others
whose
favorite
beverage
was
human
blood
dragons
and
unicorns
woolly
hens
and
sheep
that
grew
on
trees
and
in
one
island
a
valley
where
only
devils
dwelt
but
there
were
besides
great
hills
of
gold
cities
with
towers
of
silver
and
gold
precious
stones
of
all
kinds
and
pearls
big
and
round
there
was
trade
between
europe
and
certain
parts
of
asia
which
they
called
the
indies
and
reached
by
going
east
and
south
by
land
but
this
marvelous
country
of
the
grand
khan
lay
beyond
and
its
riches
remained
a
golden
dream
known
only
by
the
travelers
reports
that
was
what
was
known
of
asia
of
africa
even
less
for
fifty
years
before
columbus
was
born
only
a
strip
across
the
northern
part
of
it
was
known
and
south
of
that
lay
nothing
said
the
people
and
of
america
our
america
they
never
dreamed
some
fifty
years
before
the
birth
of
columbus
prince
henry
of
portugal
studying
the
matter
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
world
did
not
necessarily
end
at
cape
nothing
on
the
african
coast
as
people
said
but
perhaps
extended
a
long
way
farther
and
having
an
abundance
of
time
and
money
he
began
to
send
out
ships
to
sail
along
beyond
the
cape
and
see
what
they
could
find
and
they
found
a
long
long
coast
year
after
year
until
the
prince
was
a
old
man
he
sent
out
vessel
after
vessel
and
though
often
and
wrecked
and
unsuccessful
they
many
times
came
back
with
accounts
of
new
discoveries
one
by
one
they
brought
the
numerous
islands
lying
off
the
northwest
coast
of
africa
to
the
notice
of
the
people
of
europe
and
after
they
once
got
past
that
mysterious
cape
nothing
they
sailed
along
the
coast
going
farther
and
farther
on
successive
voyages
until
in
long
after
prince
henry
death
and
just
before
columbus
great
voyage
the
most
southern
point
was
rounded
the
african
continent
was
known
and
the
to
the
indies
was
established
the
idea
as
to
the
date
of
columbus
birth
historians
can
not
agree
within
some
ten
years
it
was
doubtless
some
where
between
and
they
also
give
different
accounts
as
to
his
birthplace
but
it
seems
most
probable
that
he
was
born
in
genoa
on
the
mediterranean
the
son
of
a
and
that
he
went
to
school
in
pavia
at
fourteen
he
became
a
sailor
up
and
down
the
seas
first
in
the
sunny
mediterranean
later
along
the
stormy
atlantic
coast
sailed
the
lad
the
young
man
in
the
small
sailing
vessels
of
the
time
and
learned
well
the
ocean
which
he
afterward
so
boldly
trusted
illustration
view
of
genoa
he
was
a
daring
handsome
bronzed
young
man
when
he
went
to
lisbon
where
his
brother
bartholomew
was
established
as
a
cosmographer
making
charts
for
seamen
and
with
all
his
enthusiasm
for
his
life
he
had
enough
interest
in
ordinary
pursuits
to
fall
in
love
most
romantically
it
happened
on
account
of
his
being
so
regular
at
church
every
day
he
must
attend
service
and
every
day
to
church
came
donna
philippa
palestrello
who
lived
in
a
convent
near
by
across
the
seats
flitted
involuntary
glances
between
the
cloistered
maiden
and
the
handsome
brown
sailor
with
a
dimple
in
his
chin
some
pictures
have
him
something
besides
prayers
were
read
between
the
lines
of
the
and
the
marriage
which
closed
this
churchly
wooing
proved
the
wisdom
of
both
parties
philippa
father
had
been
one
of
prince
henry
famous
seamen
and
the
governor
of
porto
santo
one
of
the
islands
and
after
his
marriage
columbus
lived
sometimes
at
porto
santo
sometimes
at
lisbon
and
much
of
the
time
on
the
sea
he
sailed
south
along
the
african
coast
to
guinea
north
he
sailed
to
england
and
farther
on
to
iceland
wherever
ships
could
go
there
went
he
intent
on
learning
all
there
was
to
know
of
the
world
he
lived
in
he
read
eagerly
all
that
was
written
about
the
earth
shape
and
size
the
modern
science
of
his
time
he
well
understood
he
pored
over
the
maps
of
the
ancient
geographer
ptolemy
over
the
maps
of
cosmas
a
later
geographer
over
palestrello
charts
given
him
by
philippa
mother
ptolemy
said
the
world
is
round
but
cosmas
whom
good
christians
were
bound
to
believe
since
he
founded
his
science
on
the
bible
said
it
is
flat
with
a
wall
around
it
to
hold
up
the
sky
very
probable
certainly
but
that
notion
of
the
ancients
that
the
world
is
round
like
a
ball
had
been
caught
up
and
believed
by
a
handful
of
men
scattered
sparsely
down
through
the
centuries
and
of
late
lead
gained
among
advanced
scientists
more
of
a
following
than
ever
and
columbus
who
with
all
his
enthusiasm
for
adventure
and
his
reverence
for
religion
and
he
church
had
a
clear
unbiased
scientific
head
mentally
turned
his
back
upon
cosmas
and
clasped
hands
with
the
ancients
and
the
wisest
scientists
of
his
own
day
the
north
was
known
the
south
was
fast
becoming
so
the
east
had
been
penetrated
but
the
west
was
unexplored
stretching
along
from
thule
the
distant
iceland
to
the
southern
part
of
the
great
african
continent
thousands
of
miles
lay
the
sea
of
darkness
as
the
people
called
it
what
lay
beyond
the
question
had
been
asked
before
times
enough
times
enough
answered
for
any
reasonable
man
hell
was
there
said
one
superstition
have
you
seen
the
flames
at
a
sea
thick
like
paste
in
which
no
ships
can
sail
said
another
darkness
said
another
thick
darkness
the
blackness
of
nothing
and
the
end
of
all
created
things
there
a
legend
that
over
there
beyond
was
paradise
and
brandan
wandering
about
the
seas
had
reached
it
the
ancients
told
of
an
island
atlantis
over
there
somewhere
in
the
west
and
one
of
them
had
said
in
the
last
days
an
age
will
come
when
ocean
shall
loose
the
chains
of
things
a
wonderful
country
will
be
discovered
and
tiphis
shall
make
known
new
worlds
nor
shall
thule
be
the
end
of
the
earth
ah
to
be
the
discoverer
of
atlantis
or
paradise
but
if
the
world
is
round
said
columbus
it
is
not
hell
that
lies
beyond
that
stormy
sea
over
there
lie
the
eastern
strand
of
asia
the
cathay
of
marco
polo
the
land
of
the
kubla
khan
and
cipango
the
great
island
beyond
it
nonsense
said
the
neighbors
the
world
round
ca
you
it
is
flat
and
cosmas
indicopleustes
who
lived
hundreds
of
years
before
you
were
born
says
it
is
flat
and
he
got
it
from
the
bible
you
no
good
christian
to
be
taking
up
with
such
heathenish
notions
thought
columbus
i
will
write
to
paolo
toscanelli
at
florence
and
see
what
be
will
say
so
columbus
wrote
and
toscanelli
the
wise
scientist
answered
that
the
idea
of
sailing
west
was
good
and
feasible
and
with
the
letter
came
a
map
on
which
asia
and
the
great
island
cipango
were
laid
down
opposite
europe
with
the
atlantic
between
exactly
as
columbus
imagined
it
toscanelli
said
it
was
easy
enough
you
may
be
certain
of
meeting
with
extensive
kingdoms
populous
cities
and
rich
provinces
abounding
in
all
sorts
of
precious
stones
and
your
visit
will
cause
great
rejoicing
to
the
king
and
princes
of
those
distant
lands
besides
opening
a
way
for
communication
between
them
and
the
christians
and
the
instruction
of
them
in
the
catholic
religion
and
the
arts
we
possess
it
was
when
this
encouragement
came
and
from
this
time
all
the
sailor
thoughts
and
plans
turned
toward
the
west
the
life
at
home
between
his
voyages
whether
spent
with
his
brother
the
cosmographer
at
lisbon
or
with
his
wife
and
sailor
on
the
porto
santo
island
was
hardly
less
nautical
than
the
voyages
themselves
porto
santo
was
in
line
with
the
to
and
from
spain
and
all
the
african
coast
and
islands
and
the
family
there
with
the
men
sailors
and
geographers
and
the
women
wives
and
daughters
of
sailors
and
geographers
lived
in
the
bracing
salt
full
of
the
tingle
of
adventure
wild
stories
tell
the
sailors
coming
and
going
whom
one
can
scarce
contradict
for
lack
of
certain
knowledge
and
is
it
not
an
age
of
wonders
in
real
life
and
the
round
earth
the
round
earth
it
round
and
the
empire
of
the
grand
khan
just
over
the
western
water
there
not
far
the
sailors
said
that
on
the
shores
of
one
of
the
islands
two
dead
men
of
strange
appearance
had
been
washed
in
from
the
west
the
sailors
said
they
had
picked
up
sticks
drifting
from
the
west
pedro
correa
himself
and
a
man
to
be
trusted
had
found
one
floating
from
the
west
and
there
was
a
legend
of
the
sight
of
land
lying
like
a
faint
cloud
along
that
western
horizon
the
world
round
said
columbus
it
is
not
very
large
he
thought
it
much
smaller
than
it
is
and
opposite
us
across
that
sea
lies
asia
and
to
asia
by
way
of
that
sea
i
will
go
there
in
the
west
lies
my
duty
to
god
and
man
i
will
carry
salvation
to
the
heathen
and
bring
back
gold
for
the
christians
from
the
to
the
orient
a
path
i
will
find
through
the
waters
the
waiting
such
a
venture
as
columbus
proposed
could
scarcely
be
carried
out
at
that
time
except
by
the
help
of
kings
so
to
the
kings
went
columbus
naturally
portugal
with
her
proved
interest
in
discovery
came
first
in
his
thought
and
before
portugal
king
he
laid
his
project
the
king
should
fit
him
out
with
vessels
and
men
and
with
them
columbus
would
sail
to
the
indies
not
by
the
route
around
africa
which
the
portuguese
had
so
long
been
seeking
but
by
a
nearer
way
straight
across
the
atlantic
think
of
the
untold
wealth
from
the
empire
of
the
khan
rolling
in
to
portugal
if
this
connection
could
be
established
and
think
of
converting
those
heathen
to
our
blessed
mother
church
it
was
worth
thinking
about
and
the
king
called
a
council
of
his
wise
men
to
consider
the
startling
idea
not
long
were
the
wise
men
in
wisely
deciding
that
the
plan
was
the
wild
scheme
of
an
adventurer
likely
to
come
to
no
good
whatever
and
when
the
king
hardly
satisfied
laid
it
before
another
council
they
too
wisely
declared
it
ridiculous
o
ye
owlish
dignitaries
still
the
king
was
not
convinced
we
have
discovered
much
by
daring
adventure
why
not
more
stick
to
the
coast
and
do
go
sailing
straight
away
from
all
known
land
into
waters
unknown
and
mysterious
said
the
wise
men
but
if
the
unknown
waters
bring
us
to
the
riches
of
cathay
said
the
king
that
the
extravagant
dream
of
a
visionary
it
contains
no
truth
and
much
danger
said
the
wise
men
try
it
yourself
and
see
unbeknown
to
this
columbus
just
send
out
a
ship
of
your
own
to
the
west
and
let
them
come
back
and
tell
us
what
they
find
it
was
a
most
underhand
piece
of
business
all
around
but
the
king
yielded
and
sent
out
a
ship
which
presently
came
back
again
with
the
report
that
there
was
no
cathay
there
and
they
had
found
any
cipango
it
was
all
nonsense
and
what
they
had
met
with
was
a
big
storm
that
scared
them
terribly
so
columbus
retired
and
left
the
king
of
portugal
to
his
brave
sailors
and
wise
councilors
next
will
come
spain
and
meantime
he
will
send
his
brother
bartholomew
to
present
the
plan
at
the
english
court
the
spanish
sovereigns
ferdinand
and
isabella
were
down
in
andalusia
that
beautiful
southern
province
of
spain
in
the
midst
of
a
war
with
the
moors
who
occupied
certain
portions
of
the
land
and
whom
the
spaniards
were
trying
to
drive
out
so
his
wife
being
now
dead
columbus
took
his
little
boy
diego
and
to
andalusia
they
went
they
stopped
at
palos
by
the
sea
and
from
there
set
out
on
foot
the
way
was
long
and
diego
could
not
go
far
without
getting
very
thirsty
and
his
father
stopping
at
a
great
dark
stone
convent
called
maria
de
la
rabida
to
get
him
a
drink
the
prior
asked
them
in
to
rest
a
bit
as
they
talked
columbus
soon
told
of
his
great
project
to
sail
to
the
indies
by
way
of
the
western
sea
the
prior
in
his
long
dark
robe
and
shaved
head
opened
his
eyes
at
this
and
wanted
to
hear
more
novel
project
this
thought
he
very
astonishing
i
must
have
my
friend
fernandez
hear
it
so
a
messenger
was
sent
to
palos
to
fetch
the
doctor
and
columbus
went
over
again
the
wonderful
plan
just
to
sail
west
not
so
very
far
over
the
round
earth
and
reach
the
stately
cities
of
cathay
and
convert
the
grand
khan
to
the
faith
and
gather
of
the
plentiful
gold
and
jewels
of
that
land
little
diego
stood
by
and
listened
with
eyes
and
the
doctor
pondered
while
the
prior
gazed
out
from
the
western
window
upon
the
atlantic
and
columbus
bent
eager
eyes
and
flushed
face
over
his
chart
why
it
may
be
possible
send
for
martin
alonzo
pinzon
he
is
a
seaman
let
us
see
what
he
thinks
to
palos
again
goes
the
messenger
to
the
rich
and
influential
citizen
alonzo
pinzon
and
tells
him
he
is
wanted
at
la
pabida
ah
alonzo
pinzon
greets
him
the
prior
come
and
hear
what
a
man
proposes
to
do
and
a
wise
and
courageous
sailor
he
seems
though
poor
enough
and
a
third
time
they
bend
over
the
charts
there
in
the
dark
stone
convent
and
alonzo
pinzon
hears
of
the
western
route
to
india
and
diego
gazes
from
one
to
the
other
and
hopes
in
his
heart
that
his
father
will
take
him
along
he
wants
to
see
the
unicorns
pinzon
catches
the
idea
with
enthusiasm
promising
to
help
columbus
with
money
and
influence
and
to
go
with
him
if
he
goes
the
doctor
cogitating
upon
the
statements
and
arguments
concludes
that
they
make
quite
a
reasonable
showing
and
advises
columbus
to
go
on
the
prior
says
go
at
once
to
the
court
talavera
the
confessor
is
a
good
friend
of
mine
and
a
letter
of
introduction
to
him
will
gain
you
access
to
the
king
and
queen
they
will
surely
help
you
diego
clasps
his
hands
will
you
stay
with
me
diego
says
the
prior
i
rather
go
to
court
says
diego
nay
my
son
says
columbus
if
the
good
prior
will
keep
you
i
will
leave
you
here
while
i
go
on
my
uncertain
errand
so
the
little
boy
stands
in
the
great
stone
doorway
and
watches
his
father
out
of
sight
toward
cordova
at
cordova
is
nothing
but
excitement
and
confusion
the
army
is
just
starting
upon
a
campaign
against
the
moors
talavera
is
preoccupied
has
his
hands
full
of
business
and
can
scarcely
give
columbus
time
enough
to
state
his
errand
dear
me
a
new
route
to
the
indies
but
do
you
see
how
busy
we
are
with
this
war
it
is
probably
all
nonsense
sounds
like
it
the
court
in
can
not
waste
precious
hours
over
the
consideration
of
such
wild
visions
as
this
so
columbus
takes
lodgings
in
cordova
supports
himself
by
talks
to
everybody
about
the
new
route
to
asia
and
waits
such
a
man
with
such
a
story
is
likely
to
gain
some
attention
and
by
and
by
he
begins
to
have
friends
several
of
the
important
politicians
come
to
know
him
some
are
converts
to
his
theory
and
finally
the
grand
cardinal
himself
procures
him
an
audience
with
the
king
and
queen
enthusiastically
the
man
unfolds
his
theories
to
royalty
the
land
of
the
grand
khan
with
its
untold
treasure
the
salvation
of
millions
of
souls
in
the
indies
are
the
vivid
points
the
earth
is
a
sphere
and
a
ship
may
sail
straight
from
spain
to
cipango
urges
this
man
of
imagination
and
faith
the
king
was
not
slow
to
perceive
the
great
advantages
which
success
in
such
an
enterprise
would
bring
to
the
government
that
undertook
it
but
he
must
consult
the
wise
men
talavera
should
head
a
commission
composed
of
the
great
men
in
the
church
great
men
of
science
and
professors
in
the
universities
surely
no
man
could
ask
for
more
so
to
salamanca
seat
of
the
greatest
spanish
university
columbus
went
to
convince
the
commission
in
the
hall
of
the
convent
there
was
assembled
the
imposing
company
shaved
monks
in
gowns
of
black
and
gray
fashionably
dressed
men
from
the
court
in
jaunty
bats
cardinals
in
scarlet
robes
all
the
dignity
and
learning
of
spain
gathered
and
waiting
for
the
man
and
his
idea
he
stands
before
them
with
his
charts
and
explains
his
belief
that
the
world
is
round
and
that
asia
stretches
from
the
eastern
boundary
of
europe
to
a
point
something
like
four
thousand
miles
from
spain
hence
asia
could
be
reached
by
sailing
due
west
across
the
atlantic
they
had
heard
something
of
this
before
at
cordova
and
here
at
salamanca
before
the
commission
was
formally
assembled
and
they
had
their
arguments
ready
you
think
the
earth
is
round
and
inhabited
on
the
other
side
are
you
not
aware
that
the
holy
fathers
of
the
church
have
condemned
this
belief
say
the
fathers
the
scriptures
tell
us
all
men
are
descended
from
adam
but
certainly
no
men
descended
from
adam
live
in
such
a
region
as
this
you
speak
of
the
antipodes
will
you
contradict
the
fathers
the
holy
scriptures
too
tell
us
expressly
that
the
heavens
are
spread
out
like
a
tent
and
how
can
that
be
true
if
the
earth
is
not
flat
like
the
ground
the
tent
stands
on
this
theory
of
yours
looks
heretical
columbus
might
well
quake
in
his
boots
at
the
mention
of
heresy
for
there
was
that
new
inquisition
just
in
fine
running
order
with
its
elaborate
banging
burning
mangling
system
for
heretics
what
would
become
of
the
idea
if
he
should
get
passed
over
to
that
energetic
institution
i
am
a
true
and
loyal
catholic
he
cries
i
wish
to
convert
the
grand
khan
people
to
our
blessed
faith
i
believe
the
bible
and
god
himself
sends
me
on
this
mission
but
these
words
of
the
scriptures
are
to
be
taken
as
a
figure
not
as
literal
facts
of
science
will
this
sailor
teach
us
how
to
read
the
scriptures
growl
the
monks
well
for
argument
suppose
this
world
is
round
and
you
could
sail
west
to
the
indies
the
voyage
would
take
years
and
you
could
not
carry
food
enough
to
keep
you
from
starving
but
i
believe
it
is
only
a
voyage
of
four
thousand
miles
and
can
with
favoring
winds
be
accomplished
in
a
short
time
says
columbus
stating
his
scientific
reasons
for
this
belief
will
this
sailor
teach
us
science
growl
the
professors
well
all
this
be
true
but
really
can
you
expect
us
to
believe
that
there
is
a
land
beneath
us
where
people
walk
with
their
feet
and
trees
grow
oh
foolish
columbus
what
an
absurd
idea
and
besides
if
the
signor
should
succeed
in
sailing
down
around
the
earth
to
this
peculiar
region
how
does
he
propose
to
get
back
again
will
his
ship
sail
oh
the
nudgings
and
winks
among
the
monks
at
this
poser
and
the
professors
smile
triumphantly
and
anyway
who
are
you
signor
colombo
to
set
yourself
up
to
know
more
than
all
the
world
beside
have
men
been
sailing
in
all
the
seas
ever
since
the
time
of
noah
and
if
such
a
thing
as
this
were
possible
would
not
somebody
have
found
it
out
long
ago
with
sound
science
reverent
religion
enthusiastic
imagination
and
faith
he
answered
them
this
unknown
sailor
and
left
them
bewildered
by
his
views
and
impressed
by
his
personality
perhaps
there
is
truth
in
the
matter
said
the
monks
of
stephen
they
said
they
would
think
about
it
and
they
did
think
about
it
and
it
took
them
four
years
to
think
about
it
meantime
they
adjourned
and
went
about
their
own
affairs
and
columbus
went
back
to
court
the
campaign
against
the
moors
began
and
from
that
time
to
the
end
of
those
weary
years
columbus
followed
the
court
from
place
to
place
over
the
hills
and
valleys
of
beautiful
andalusia
sometimes
he
made
charts
for
his
support
sometimes
be
fought
in
the
battles
sometimes
he
talked
with
the
courtiers
or
begged
audience
with
the
king
to
urge
him
to
a
decision
but
always
was
with
him
that
one
dream
on
which
he
was
staking
all
his
time
and
strength
the
best
years
and
the
fullest
power
of
his
manhood
hope
of
his
heart
purpose
of
his
will
that
one
idea
possessing
him
in
vivid
unwavering
faith
the
queen
was
kind
his
enthusiasm
and
sound
judgment
his
persistent
faith
in
his
idea
his
dignity
and
strong
determination
tempered
by
the
most
manly
religion
made
him
friends
even
among
his
examiners
at
salamanca
and
so
he
hoped
and
waited
think
of
it
four
years
of
suspense
on
top
of
thirteen
years
of
thought
and
study
and
investigation
toward
one
end
and
when
at
last
talavera
assembled
the
wise
men
of
the
commission
to
announce
the
result
of
their
long
deliberation
they
had
come
to
this
wise
conclusion
that
the
whole
thing
was
foolish
and
impossible
unworthy
of
a
great
attention
better
give
it
up
cristoforo
colombo
and
make
charts
for
a
living
the
rest
of
your
days
no
says
colombo
that
western
ocean
must
be
crossed
he
turns
to
the
powerful
spanish
nobles
they
are
friendly
but
hardly
dare
take
up
the
project
he
will
go
to
france
and
present
his
case
but
first
to
la
rabida
to
see
diego
a
tall
lad
now
what
says
the
prior
no
success
too
bad
too
bad
but
spain
must
not
give
the
glory
of
this
great
undertaking
to
france
i
know
the
queen
and
i
will
write
to
her
i
was
her
confessor
once
he
wrote
with
such
force
that
he
was
summoned
to
the
queen
at
once
and
his
earnest
pleading
determined
isabella
to
send
again
for
columbus
but
again
disappointment
came
for
they
took
offense
at
columbus
high
demands
and
would
not
grant
them
the
spanish
sovereigns
were
to
furnish
the
largest
share
of
the
equipment
he
should
be
admiral
of
the
seas
and
he
and
his
sons
after
him
were
to
rule
under
the
king
the
countries
discovered
and
share
in
all
the
profits
of
the
enterprise
bold
demands
from
an
adventurer
seventeen
years
of
waiting
might
have
taught
him
common
sense
but
with
his
absurd
faith
and
uncommon
sense
he
would
accept
no
other
terms
and
turned
away
again
with
his
idea
and
his
determination
too
bad
too
bad
said
angel
the
will
plead
with
the
queen
she
must
not
let
slip
this
chance
of
enriching
the
king
converting
the
khan
i
will
myself
lend
the
money
necessary
if
the
king
ca
afford
it
said
isabella
to
angel
i
think
as
you
do
this
is
a
wonderful
plan
let
them
say
what
they
will
by
my
own
right
i
am
queen
of
castile
as
well
as
queen
of
spain
and
i
pledge
the
crown
of
castile
to
raise
for
cristoforo
colombo
a
suitable
equipment
to
sail
to
the
indies
by
the
west
let
him
make
his
own
terms
at
last
the
fretting
applications
the
repeated
explanations
the
harrowing
suspense
the
long
restriction
are
over
and
the
strong
wings
of
the
are
free
to
bear
away
over
the
atlantic
the
voyage
at
palos
in
southern
spain
three
small
ships
were
provided
one
the
santa
maria
in
which
columbus
was
to
sail
was
fully
decked
the
other
two
the
pinta
and
the
niña
had
decks
and
cabins
only
at
the
ends
as
for
crews
to
secure
them
was
no
easy
matter
not
many
sailors
cared
to
trust
themselves
upon
that
unknown
sea
of
not
many
believed
in
this
story
of
a
western
route
to
asia
a
few
with
visions
of
the
grand
khan
palaces
and
the
marvelous
sights
of
the
east
would
go
for
adventure
sake
and
risk
the
mystery
between
a
few
thinking
of
the
great
hills
of
gold
would
risk
the
danger
of
tumbling
into
hell
midway
for
the
chance
of
getting
safely
across
to
the
land
of
treasure
alonzo
pinzon
was
on
hand
as
he
had
promised
and
was
given
command
of
the
pinta
while
the
niña
was
put
in
charge
of
his
brother
vincent
royal
pardon
for
crimes
and
offenses
was
offered
for
any
who
would
undertake
this
voyage
and
so
some
were
added
to
the
company
queer
stuff
for
such
an
undertaking
but
beggars
can
not
be
choosers
and
cristoforo
colombo
might
be
thankful
that
he
could
get
anybody
for
his
fool
errand
on
august
in
the
early
morning
the
three
ships
lay
in
palos
harbor
and
down
to
palos
harbor
flock
all
the
town
to
see
them
off
for
cathay
groups
of
shudder
companionably
over
the
vague
terrors
of
the
atlantic
and
chatter
over
the
probabilities
of
the
adventurers
return
with
untold
wealth
excited
again
upon
the
strong
controlled
face
of
columbus
and
thank
god
for
this
missionary
to
the
grand
the
dark
sea
will
surely
be
his
destruction
before
he
gets
there
children
wriggle
through
the
throng
and
stare
at
the
men
who
are
soon
to
find
out
what
becomes
of
the
sun
when
it
sets
and
to
know
for
themselves
whether
or
no
it
hisses
and
makes
the
water
boil
the
sailors
make
their
way
toward
the
ships
through
a
running
fire
of
conversation
and
culminating
at
the
dock
in
general
and
the
clinging
embraces
and
sobs
of
daughters
and
sweethearts
and
wives
the
pinzons
are
there
with
their
friends
fernandez
is
going
too
and
the
prior
of
la
rabida
in
his
long
robe
is
exulting
with
him
over
this
success
diego
soon
to
go
to
court
as
page
to
the
prince
is
there
to
bid
his
father
now
all
are
on
the
docks
ready
to
embark
a
hundred
and
twenty
men
to
brave
the
unknown
terrors
of
that
sea
stretching
before
them
the
prior
steps
gravely
down
among
them
carrying
the
sacred
host
kneeling
before
him
columbus
murmurs
his
last
confession
and
receives
the
communion
and
after
him
the
pinzons
and
the
sailors
reverently
commune
the
people
are
silent
as
the
prior
blesses
the
departing
ones
and
then
the
ships
are
manned
the
sails
spread
and
palos
watches
until
they
flutter
like
white
birds
out
of
to
return
moan
the
daughters
and
the
sweethearts
and
the
wives
and
the
children
with
wide
dark
eyes
whisper
of
the
unicorns
and
dragons
of
the
east
off
at
last
oh
the
exhilaration
of
it
admiral
of
three
rickety
ships
and
all
the
unknown
seas
governor
of
a
hundred
disreputable
sailors
and
the
realms
of
cathay
they
had
not
been
out
three
days
when
the
pinta
rudder
got
out
of
order
that
crew
of
the
pinta
had
been
none
too
willing
to
start
on
this
rash
expedition
and
columbus
had
his
suspicions
that
they
put
it
out
of
order
on
purpose
perhaps
they
did
anyway
the
next
day
it
was
reported
broken
again
and
columbus
pointed
for
one
of
the
canary
islands
to
get
it
mended
we
are
going
to
cathay
by
way
of
the
western
ocean
they
said
in
reply
to
the
islanders
questions
oh
said
the
islanders
every
year
we
can
see
land
lying
west
of
us
away
off
there
you
will
find
it
though
none
of
us
have
been
there
some
weeks
of
delay
that
unseaworthy
pinta
caused
but
at
last
on
september
they
were
once
more
started
now
the
and
with
their
homes
and
the
known
world
behind
them
into
the
west
they
sailed
hardly
had
the
land
disappeared
when
the
sailors
dismayed
at
their
own
boldness
began
to
be
frightened
enough
the
steersmen
let
the
vessels
drift
around
a
bit
steer
to
the
sternly
cried
columbus
there
was
grumbling
in
the
crew
and
the
admiral
showed
his
wit
by
commencing
then
and
there
two
records
of
the
distance
traveled
each
day
the
record
for
the
faithless
sailors
edification
showed
fewer
miles
than
the
reality
and
the
truth
of
the
matter
no
one
knew
but
himself
from
that
day
until
he
brought
them
safe
to
the
other
side
the
fifth
day
a
fragment
of
a
ship
drifted
by
them
a
wreck
cried
the
sailors
and
grew
gloomy
over
the
bad
omen
one
night
a
remarkable
bolt
of
fire
fell
into
the
sea
and
the
superstitious
men
were
how
could
they
go
on
in
the
face
of
this
message
from
heaven
but
go
on
they
must
this
remarkable
admiral
said
calmly
steer
to
the
west
as
the
days
went
on
they
began
to
meet
large
patches
of
weeds
very
green
we
must
be
near
to
land
said
the
sailors
perhaps
some
island
said
the
admiral
but
the
continent
we
shall
find
further
ahead
another
strange
thing
happened
that
little
compass
their
only
sure
guide
to
cathay
began
to
behave
as
if
it
too
had
lost
its
head
over
this
foolhardy
undertaking
the
neighbors
at
home
had
warned
them
that
the
devil
managed
the
compass
and
this
needle
never
known
to
point
anywhere
but
north
now
pointed
west
of
north
was
the
devil
steering
them
for
hell
heaven
fiery
bolt
had
warned
them
they
had
not
heeded
and
now
the
devil
was
tampering
with
the
compass
poor
sailors
they
looked
fiercely
on
columbus
and
wished
themselves
well
out
of
this
business
but
the
admiral
faced
the
strange
occurrence
quietly
though
his
heart
may
well
have
beat
fearfully
and
proceeded
to
investigate
its
cause
he
soon
announced
it
it
is
the
north
star
that
moves
he
coolly
informed
the
terrified
men
the
needle
is
always
true
the
admiral
was
certainly
a
marvelously
wise
man
and
the
sailors
said
no
more
eleven
days
out
no
thickening
of
the
sea
yet
except
with
this
mass
of
floating
weed
no
darkness
except
the
darkness
of
night
no
nearer
the
sunset
and
always
at
that
golden
western
path
across
the
water
weeds
weeds
vast
stretches
of
weeds
they
must
betoken
land
and
a
live
crab
discovered
among
them
would
surely
seem
to
indicate
it
the
sea
is
smooth
the
air
clear
it
is
like
andalusia
in
april
all
but
the
nightingales
exclaims
the
admiral
what
would
you
give
to
hear
a
nightingale
just
now
admiral
gazing
into
the
moonlit
infinity
of
silence
that
enspheres
you
you
can
not
bear
the
crystal
tension
go
below
to
the
relief
of
the
narrow
room
and
the
journal
faithfully
kept
more
signs
of
land
they
kill
tunnies
sure
sign
say
the
sailors
and
all
the
signs
are
from
the
west
where
i
hope
the
high
god
in
whose
hand
is
all
victory
will
speedily
direct
us
to
land
writes
the
admiral
even
the
faithless
sailors
begin
to
forget
their
sullen
disapproval
and
the
three
ships
race
merrily
to
see
which
shall
first
discover
land
great
flocks
of
birds
alonzo
pinzon
saw
from
the
pinta
this
very
night
we
shall
reach
land
i
believe
he
exulted
and
the
pinta
swiftly
shot
ahead
expecting
to
sight
the
shore
at
any
moment
there
must
be
islands
all
about
us
thought
the
admiral
but
we
will
not
stay
for
them
now
straight
to
the
west
still
no
land
for
all
the
signs
and
eager
watching
leagues
of
undulating
weeds
but
no
land
and
the
sailors
grumble
again
they
fear
that
they
never
shall
meet
in
these
seas
with
a
fair
wind
to
return
to
spain
a
heartens
them
but
it
quickly
flits
off
laden
with
kisses
for
andalusian
sweethearts
and
again
the
east
wind
fills
the
sails
and
carries
them
away
and
away
and
away
alonzo
pinzon
and
columbus
hold
a
conference
and
columbus
spreading
out
that
dear
map
of
the
atlantic
lying
between
europe
and
asia
traces
for
the
pilots
the
course
they
have
pursued
a
bold
straight
westerly
line
and
shows
them
that
they
are
now
near
the
islands
of
the
asiatic
coast
inspired
delusion
how
did
it
happen
that
the
distance
you
reckoned
to
asia
was
just
the
distance
that
landed
you
on
american
shores
then
again
all
eyes
strain
to
the
west
and
the
three
little
ships
in
that
great
circle
of
water
steer
swiftly
on
their
unknown
course
to
unknown
lands
the
excited
sailors
can
scarce
do
their
work
we
are
nearing
land
the
admiral
says
he
says
it
will
be
perhaps
cipango
itself
think
of
the
gold
and
the
dragons
a
coward
in
cipango
the
king
has
his
palace
roofed
and
floored
with
gold
and
the
pearls
there
are
of
a
beautiful
if
it
is
not
cipango
it
will
be
still
some
other
famous
island
if
not
cathay
but
bethink
you
of
the
monsters
of
those
islands
we
are
like
to
meet
men
they
say
and
lions
and
beasts
with
heads
ay
but
the
gold
the
gold
what
will
gold
be
to
thee
man
with
a
cannibal
drinking
thy
blood
and
there
is
somewhere
there
a
valley
of
devils
hist
about
that
there
no
need
to
speak
any
land
were
better
than
this
dreary
endless
ocean
ay
ay
any
land
were
better
than
this
endless
ocean
i
go
to
look
for
land
the
admiral
offers
a
reward
to
the
man
first
discovering
it
ho
for
the
west
and
the
golden
cities
of
cathay
monsters
devils
the
admiral
was
a
man
of
science
and
not
of
superstition
but
those
wild
stories
may
well
have
made
the
night
uncanny
for
him
suddenly
alonzo
pinzon
cried
land
and
with
praiseworthy
prudence
hastened
to
claim
the
reward
the
admiral
fell
on
his
knees
and
thanked
god
alonzo
pinzon
crew
sang
the
gloria
the
men
of
the
niña
ran
up
the
rigging
and
shouted
that
the
land
was
truly
there
all
night
the
excited
men
talked
of
nothing
but
that
land
and
the
admiral
changed
their
course
to
southwest
where
it
appeared
to
lie
fast
they
sailed
till
morning
till
noon
till
afternoon
and
then
discovered
that
what
they
had
taken
for
land
was
nothing
but
clouds
oh
the
fearful
reaction
after
that
tense
hours
there
is
no
further
shore
cried
the
sailors
it
is
as
they
said
the
sea
goes
on
forever
and
we
are
going
to
death
the
admiral
quietly
ordered
sail
on
into
the
west
they
could
not
gainsay
him
he
willed
it
and
they
sailed
on
weeds
and
birds
still
float
and
fly
about
the
ships
fine
weather
and
the
sea
smooth
many
thanks
to
god
says
the
admiral
alonzo
pinzon
wished
to
seek
the
islands
that
might
be
near
them
no
said
the
admiral
we
shall
not
change
our
course
put
the
signs
of
land
again
brought
reviving
spirits
and
new
hope
to
the
men
and
again
the
three
ships
try
to
outsail
one
another
in
the
race
for
the
first
discovery
the
nina
suddenly
fired
a
salute
signal
of
land
but
the
land
did
not
appear
seeing
flocks
of
birds
flying
southwest
columbus
altered
his
course
to
that
direction
thinking
that
the
birds
knew
better
than
he
where
land
lay
and
three
days
more
they
sailed
watching
eagerly
the
various
signs
weeds
pelicans
passing
birds
gazing
gazing
gazing
upon
that
unbroken
boundary
line
sweeping
around
the
lonesome
watery
world
only
sky
and
sea
sea
and
sky
with
lines
of
passing
birds
black
across
the
one
and
the
undulating
weeds
streaking
the
other
three
little
ships
with
spreading
sails
under
the
blue
dome
that
distant
limiting
circle
delicately
distinct
always
curving
in
unbroken
perfection
ah
the
calm
cruelty
of
the
smiling
sea
and
sky
the
admiral
encouraged
them
in
the
best
manner
he
could
representing
the
profits
they
were
about
to
acquire
and
adding
that
it
was
to
no
purpose
to
complain
having
come
so
far
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
continue
on
to
the
indies
till
with
the
help
of
our
lord
they
should
arrive
there
it
is
said
though
columbus
does
not
record
it
that
now
the
sailors
whispered
about
among
themselves
that
it
would
be
their
best
plan
to
throw
him
quietly
into
the
sea
and
say
he
unfortunately
fell
in
while
he
stood
absorbed
in
looking
at
the
stars
if
they
did
plot
such
folly
they
had
sense
enough
not
to
carry
it
out
so
there
was
indeed
nothing
for
it
but
to
sail
on
the
next
day
brought
more
floating
articles
and
newly
excited
expectancy
a
cane
a
log
a
carved
stick
the
pinta
found
think
of
the
way
that
carved
stick
passed
from
hand
to
hand
carved
with
an
iron
tool
said
one
nay
i
doubt
it
see
they
are
waving
a
branch
from
the
deck
ho
the
pinta
a
stalk
loaded
with
roseberries
there
must
be
land
or
else
the
devil
himself
puts
these
signs
in
our
way
alonzo
pirzon
in
the
swift
pinta
kept
ahead
night
came
down
at
ten
the
admiral
peer
into
the
darkness
saw
a
light
was
it
one
of
those
phantom
lights
reported
to
dance
over
these
waters
a
faint
glimmering
light
pero
gutierrez
come
here
i
see
a
light
look
that
way
i
see
it
too
said
pero
rodrigo
sanchez
come
here
a
light
but
rodrigo
sanchez
does
not
stand
in
the
right
place
and
sees
nothing
at
all
it
was
gone
a
moment
then
the
admiral
saw
it
moving
up
and
down
it
be
an
indication
of
land
admitted
rodrigo
sanchez
but
columbus
was
certain
and
his
orders
were
prompt
and
imperative
a
strict
watch
to
be
kept
upon
the
forecastle
and
for
him
who
should
first
see
land
a
silken
jacket
and
the
reward
promised
by
the
king
and
queen
at
midnight

in

morning
it
was
friday
october
five
weeks
since
they
saw
the
last
of
the
canaries
they
found
that
the
land
was
a
small
island
with
naked
people
on
its
shore
here
we
are
at
last
we
have
accomplished

you

occasion
alonzo

and
the

bears
the
royal
standard
of
our
sovereigns
all
aboard
put
off
the
boat
row
for
the
shore
the
curious
natives
flock
about
these
strange
beings
who
come
in
winged
ships
and
have
bodies
covered
with
something
besides
skin
handsome
natives
evidently
no
cannibals
and
very
obliging
no
lions
or
hippogriffs
or
unicorns
but
gold
yes
little
pieces
of
it
hanging
about
the
savages
necks
they
make
signs
that
it
comes
from
a
land
to
the
south
cipango
thought
columbus
and
set
sail
to
find
it
they
were
in
the
group
of
islands
between
north
and
south
america
which
we
call
the
bahamas
and
the
west
indies
the
first
island
discovered
the
natives
called
guanahani
but
columbus
named
it
san
salvador
holy
saviour
they
sailed
about
among
them
hunting
for
gold
and
cipango
bartering
with
the
astonished
natives
observing
the
land
not
quite
equal
to
mandeville
tales
were
the
sights
they
saw
yet
the
luxuriant
tropical
vegetation
of
the
islands
the
trees
with
luscious
fruit
and
sweet
perfume
the
brilliant
birds
flitting
through
the
green
foliage
the
marvelous
fish
flashing
in
the
waters
the
lizards
darting
across
the
paths
were
wonderful
enough
in
their
new
beauty
to
the
eyes
of
the
europeans
i
saw
no
cannibals
says
columbus
but
he
heard
of
an
island
full
of
them
he
heard
too
of
the
island
of
the
amazons
fierce
wild
women
who
use
bows
and
spears
and
are
less
like
women
than
men
and
there
was
an
island
where
the
inhabitants
had
no
hair
and
one
where
the
people
had
tails
mermaids
he
saw
but
adds
the
honest
admiral
they
were
not
so
like
ladies
as
they
are
painted
where
do
you
get
your
gold
says
the
admiral
by
signs
to
the
islanders
cubanacan
say
the
natives
flashes
across
the
admiral
mind
and
he
sails
off
in
renewed
certainty
the
island
which
the
natives
called
colba
or
cuba
he
took
for
cipango
and
after
much
searching
he
came
to
it
at
last
when
he
did
reach
it
its
size
deceived
him
into
thinking
he
had
reached
the
continent
and
messengers
were
straightway
dispatched
to
seek
the
grand
khan
with
his
marble
bridges
and
golden
towers
columbus
bad
brought
along
a
letter
to
him
from
ferdinand
and
isabella
in
which
they
tell
him
that
having
heard
of
his
love
for
them
and
his
wish
to
hear
news
from
spain
they
now
send
their
admiral
to
tell
him
of
their
health
and
prosperity
but
the
messengers
could
not
find
the
khan
how
could
you
know

colombo
that
you
were
only
half
way
around
the
great
world
and
thousands
of
miles
yet
from

the
reward
america
was
discovered
the
daring
admiral
never
knew
it
to
the
day
of
his
death
he
thought
the
world
was
only
half
as
large
as
it
is
and
that
he
had
sailed
west
to
cathay
america
was
discovered

there
was
continuous
warfare
between
these
antagonistic
ideas
this
period
is
known
as
the
dark
ages
for
while
it
lasted
there
was
little
visible
progress
and
an
apparent
almost
entire
forgetfulness
of
the
ancient
civilizations
during
the
dark
ages
roving
bands
of
freebooters
wandered
about
from
place
to
place
engaged
in
robbery
rapine
and
murder
to
resist
this
systematic
plunder
the
people
placed
themselves
under
the
guardianship
of
some
powerful
chieftain
in
the
vicinity
and
paid
a
certain
amount
of
their
earnings
for
the
privilege
of
enjoying
the
remainder
hence
there
grew
up
in
the
gothic
communities
of
europe
that
peculiar
state
of
society
known
as
the
feudal
system
a
great
chieftain
or
lord
lived
in
a
strong
castle
built
for
defense
against
neighboring
lords
a
retinue
of
soldiers
was
in
immediate
attendance
who
when
not
engaged
in
war
passed
their
time
in
hunting
and
debauchery
all
the
expenses
and
waste
of
the
castle
and
its
occupants
were
defrayed
by
the
peasants
who
cultivated
the
lands
and
who
were
all
obliged
to
take
up
arms
whenever
their
lord
dominions
were
invaded
in
process
of
time
the
taxes
upon
the
people
became
so
burdensome
that
they
were
reduced
to
the
condition
of
serfs
when
all
their
earnings
except
enough
to
supply
the
barest
necessaries
of
life
were
taken
from
them
in
the
shape
of
taxes
and
rents
a
constantly
increasing
number
were
yearly
taken
from
the
ranks
of
the
industrious
to
swell
the
numbers
of
the
soldiery
until
europe
seemed
one
vast
camp
the
feudal
system
demanded
little
in
the
way
of
industry
except
agriculture
and
rude
home
manufactures
to
furnish
food
and
clothing
arms
were
purchased
from
other
lands
the
best
being
obtained
from
the
higher
civilization
of
the
moslems
but
as
population
increased
people
began
to
congregate
in
centers
and
towns
and
cities
sprung
up
these
called
for
more
varied
industries
and
a
class
of
people
soon
became
numerous
who
had
little
or
no
dependence
upon
the
feudal
lord
to
protect
themselves
craftsmen
engaged
in
the
same
kind
of
work
united
and
formed
guilds
and
the
various
guilds
though
often
warring
with
each
other
united
for
the
common
defense
the
leaders
of
the
guilds
gradually
became
the
heads
of
notable
burgher
families
who
became
influential
and
wealthy
as
the
cities
became
powerful
the
feudal
system
declined
and
in
many
regions
the
powerful
burghers
were
able
to
maintain
their
independence
not
only
against
their
old
lords
but
also
against
the
monarch
who
ruled
many
lordships
between
the
monarch
and
the
lords
there
was
a
natural
antagonism
the
monarch
endeavoring
to
gain
power
and
the
lords
endeavoring
to
retain
their
privileges
the
burghers
made
use
of
these
contending
forces
and
by
sometimes
siding
with
the
one
and
sometimes
with
the
other
they
not
only
secured
their
own
freedom
but
laid
the
foundation
for
the
freedom
of
the
people
which
is
now
generally
recognized
and
which
forms
the
very
of
our
republican
institutions
but
the
rise
of
the
burgher
class
and
the
evolution
of
human
liberty
through
their
work
was
by
no
means
an
easy
task
as
the
military
spirit
was
dominant
the
calling
of
an
artisan
was
considered
derogatory
and
lords
and
soldiers
looked
down
upon
the
industrious
classes
as
inferior
beings
scott
well
represents
this
spirit
in
the
speech
of
rob
roy
the
highland
chief
in
his
reply
to
the
offer
of
bailie
jarvie
to
get
his
sons
employment
in
a
factory
make
my
sons
weavers
i
would
see
every
loom
in
glasgow
beam
treadle
and
shuttles
burnt
in
sooner
to
break
the
force
of
the
strong
military
power
and
to
secure
to
the
industrious
classes
the
rights
of
human
beings
required
a
continuous
warfare
which
lasted
through
many
centuries
and
which
is
far
from
being
finished
at
the
present
time
but
thanks
to
the
sturdy
valor
of
the
burghers
of
the
middle
ages
human
liberty
was
maintained
and
transmitted
to
succeeding
generations
illustration
hitherto
in
the
history
of
the
world
mountains
had
been
found
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
human
liberty
thermopylæ
morgarten
bannockburn
were
all
fought
where
precipitous
and
narrow
valleys
prevented
the
champions
of
freedom
from
being
overwhelmed
by
numbers
and
where
a
single
man
in
defense
of
his
home
could
wield
more
power
than
ten
men
in
attack
the
tyrants
who
lorded
it
over
plains
had
learned
by
dear
experience
to
shun
mountains
and
avoid
collisions
with
mountaineers
and
in
case
of
controversies
they
always
endeavored
to
gain
by
stratagem
what
they
could
not
obtain
by
force
austrian
tyranny
had
dashed
itself
in
vain
against
the
alps
and
english
tyranny
had
turned
back
southward
thwarted
and
impotent
from
the
scotch
highlands
but
it
was
to
be
demonstrated
that
liberty
might
have
a
home
in
other
than

and

agriculture
the
parent
of

prosperity
flourished
as
nowhere
else
manufactures

had
followed
in
its
train
until
the
hollow

had
become
the
beehive
of

the
direction
of
the
most
vast
commercial
enterprises
had
been
transferred
from
the
lagoons
of
venice
to
the
cities
of
the
dikes
this
country
for
centuries
had
constituted
a
part
of
the
german
empire
at
one
side
of
the
great
lines
of
communication
and
moored
so
far
out
to
sea
it
had
been
overlooked
and
neglected
to
a
certain
degree
by
the
reigning
dynasties
and
out
of
this
neglect
grew
its
prosperity
while
the
rule
of
the
central
government
was
nearly
nominal
the
feudal
lords
never
obtained
a
strong
foothold
in
the
country
and
the
order
and
peace
of
the
communities
were
preserved
by
municipal
officers
chosen
by

of

wealthy
burgher

fairly
divided

acid
dictated
a
policy
at

wise
and
humane
extortioners
were
suppressed
industries
fostered
and
peace
maintained
in
the
religious
controversies
which
followed
the
preaching
of
luther
the
eastern
provinces
of
the
hollow
land
almost
exclusively
espoused
the
new
religion
while
the
western
provinces
clung
as
tenaciously
to
the
old
while
this
difference
in
religious
opinions
gave
rise
to
disputes
and
tended
toward
the
disruption
of
social
relations
for
many
years
toleration
was
practiced
and
peace
preserved
during
the
reign
of
charles
v
as
emperor
of
germany
the
lowland
countries
were
permitted
to
go
on
in
their
career
of
prosperity
with
the
exception
of
a
religious
persecution
charles
was
a
bigot
and
for
a
time
he
tried
to
put
down
heresy
with
a
strong
hand
but
finding
the
new
doctrines
firmly
established
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
he
relaxed
his
persecutions
and
permitted
things
to
take
pretty
much
their
own
course
on
the
abdication
of
charles
v
in
spain
and
the
low
countries
fell
to
the
lot
of
philip
ii
notwithstanding
the
riches
which
had
poured
into
spain
from
the
plunder
of
mexico
and
peru
the
netherlands
were
the
richest
part
of
philip
dominions
yielding
him
a
princely
revenue
but
the
free
spirit
manifested
by
these
artisans
in
their
homes
by
the
sea
was
contrary
to
all
philip
ideas
of
government
and
was
constantly
galling
to
his
personal
pride
so
he
determined
to
reduce
his
teutonic
subjects
to
the
same
degree
of
abject
submission
that
he
had
the
residents
of
the
sunny
lands
of
spain
to
give
intensity
to
his
resolve
philip
was
a
bigot
and
in
carrying
out
his
state
designs
he
was
also
gratifying
his
religious
animosities
and
giving
expression
to
his
almost
insane
religious
hatreds
his
policy
was
directly
calculated
to
ruin
the
most
prosperous
part
of
his
own
dominions
to
kill
the
goose
which
laid
the
golden
egg
philip
spent
the
first
five
years
of
his
reign
in
the
netherlands
waiting
the
issue
of
a
war
in
which
he
was
engaged
with
france
during
this
period
his
flemish
and
dutch
subjects
began
to
have
some
experience
of
his
government
they
observed
with
alarm
that
the
king
hated
the
country
and
distrusted
the
people
he
would
speak
no
other
language
than
spanish
his
counselors
were
spaniards
he
kept
spaniards
alone
about
his
person
and
it
was
to
spaniards
that
all
vacant
posts
were
assigned
besides
certain
of
his
measures
gave
great
dissatisfaction
he
the
persecuting
edicts
against
the
protestants
which
his
father
in
the
end
of
his
reign
had
suffered
to
fall
into
disuse
and
the
severities
which
ensued
began
to
drive
hundreds
of
the
most
useful
citizens
out
of
the
country
as
well
as
to
injure
trade
by
deterring
protestant
merchants
from
the
dutch
and
flemish
ports
dark
hints
too
were
thrown
out
that
he
intended
to
establish
an
ecclesiastical
court
in
the
netherlands
similar
to
the
spanish
inquisition
and
the
spirit
of
catholics
as
well
as
protestants
revolted
from
the
thought
that
this
chamber
of
horrors
should
ever
become
one
of
the
institutions
of
their
free
land
he
had
also
increased
the
number
of
bishops
in
the
netherlands
from
five
to
seventeen
and
this
was
regarded
as
the
mere
appointment
of
twelve
persons
devoted
to
the
spanish
interest
who
would
help
if
necessary
to
overawe
the
people
lastly
he
kept
the
provinces
full
of
spanish
troops
and
this
was
in
direct
violation
of
a
fundamental
law
of
the
country
against
these
measures
the
nobles
and
citizens
complained
bitterly
and
from
them
drew
sad
anticipations
of
the
future
nor
were
they
more
satisfied
with
the
address
in
which
through
the
bishop
of
arras
as
his
spokesman
he
took
farewell
of
them
at
a
convention
of
the
states
held
at
ghent
previous
to
his
departure
to
spain
the
oration
recommended
severity
against
heresy
and
only
promised
the
withdrawal
of
the
foreign
troops
the
reply
of
the
states
was
firm
and
bold
and
the
recollection
of
it
must
have
rankled
afterward
in
the
revengeful
mind
of
philip
i
would
rather
be
no
king
at
all
he
said
to
one
of
his
ministers
at
the
time
than
have
heretics
for
my
subjects
but
suppressing
his
resentment
in
the
mean
time
be
set
sail
for
spain
in
august
leaving
his
to
act
as
his
viceroy
in
the
netherlands
at
this
juncture
while
the
dutch
were
threatened
by
a
complete
subjugation
of
their
liberties
a
champion
arose
who
in
the
end
proved
more
than
a
match
for
philip
both
in
diplomatic
fields
and
in
military
operations
this
was
william
prince
of
orange
one
of
the
highest
nobility
but
with
his
whole
heart
in
sympathy
with
the
people
inheriting
a
personality
almost
perfect
in
physical
mental
and
moral
vigor
and
harmony
he
early
manifested
a
prudence
and
wisdom
which
gained
for
him
the
entire
confidence
of
the
suspicious
and
experienced
charles
it
was
on
the
arm
of
william
of
orange
that
charles
had
leaned
for
support
on
that
memorable
day
when
in
the
assembly
of
the
states
at
brussels
he
rose
feebly
from
his
seat
and
declared
his
abdication
of
the
sovereign
power
and
it
was
said
that
one
of
charles
last
advices
to
his
son
philip
was
to
cultivate
the
goodwill
of
the
people
of
the
netherlands
and
especially
to
defer
to
the
counsels
of
the
prince
of
orange
when
therefore
in
the
year
philip
began
his
rule
in
the
netherlands
there
were
few
persons
who
were
either
better
entitled
or
more
truly
disposed
to
act
the
part
of
faithful
and
loyal
advisers
than
william
of
nassau
then
years
of
age
but
close
as
had
been
william
relations
to
the
late
emperor
there
were
stronger
principles
and
feelings
in
his
mind
than
gratitude
to
the
son
of
the
monarch
whom
he
had
loved
he
had
thought
deeply
on
the
question
how
a
nation
should
be
governed
and
had
come
to
entertain
opinions
very
hostile
to
arbitrary
power
he
had
observed
what
appeared
to
him
as
a
catholic
gross
blunders
in
the
mode
of
treating
religious
differences
he
had
imbibed
deeply
the
dutch
spirit
of
independence
and
it
was
the
most
earnest
wish
of
his
heart
to
see
the
netherlands
prosperous
and
happy
nor
was
he
at
all
a
visionary
or
a
man
whose
activity
would
be
officious
and
troublesome
he
was
eminently
a
practical
man
one
who
had
a
strong
sense
of
what
is
expedient
in
existing
circumstances
and
his
manner
was
so
grave
and
quiet
that
he
obtained
the
name
of
william
the
silent
still
many
things
occurred
during
philip
four
years
residence
in
the
netherlands
to
make
him
speak
out
and
remonstrate
he
was
one
of
those
who
tried
to
get
the
king
to
use
gentler
and
more
popular
measures
and
the
consequence
was
that
a
decided
aversion
grew
up
in
the
dark
and
haughty
mind
of
philip
to
the
prince
of
orange
after
the
departure
of
philip
the
administration
of
the
duchess
of
parma
produced
violent
discontent
the
persecutions
of
the
protestants
were
becoming
so
fierce
that
over
and
above
the
suffering
inflicted
on
individuals
the
commerce
of
the
country
was
sensibly
falling
off
the
establishment
of
a
court
like
the
inquisition
was
still
in
contemplation
spaniards
were
still
appointed
to
places
of
trust
in
preference
to
flemings
and
finally
the
spanish
soldiers
who
ought
to
have
been
removed
long
ago
were
still
burdening
the
country
with
their
presence
the
woes
of
the
people
were
becoming
intolerable
occasionally
there
were
slight
outbreaks
of
violence
and
a
low
murmur
of
vehement
feeling
ran
through
the
whole
population
foreboding
a
general
eruption
our
poor
fatherland
they
said
to
each
other
god
has
afflicted
as
with
two
enemies
water
and
spaniards
we
have
built
dikes
and
overcome
the
one
but
how
shall
we
get
rid
of
the
other
why
if
nothing
better
occurs
we
know
one
way
at
least
and
we
shall
keep
it
in
reserve
we
can
set
the
two
enemies
against
each
other
we
can
break
down
the
dikes
inundate
the
country
and
let
the
water
and
the
spaniards
fight
it
out
between
them
about
this
time
too
the
decrees
of
the
famous
council
of
trent
which
had
been
convened
in
to
take
into
consideration
the
state
of
the
church
and
the
means
of
checking
the
new
religion
and
which
had
closed
its
sittings
in
the
end
of
were
made
public
and
philip
the
most
zealous
catholic
of
his
time
issued
immediate
orders
for
their
being
enforced
both
in
spain
and
in
the
netherlands
in
spain
the
decrees
were
received
as
a
matter
of
course
the
council
having
authority
over
the
catholic
people
but
the
attempt
to
force
the
mandates
of
an
ecclesiastical
body
upon
a
people
who
neither
acknowledged
its
authority
nor
believed
in
its
truth
was
justly
regarded
as
an
outrage
and
the
whole
country
burst
out
in
a
storm
of
indignation
in
many
places
the
decrees
were
not
executed
at
all
and
wherever
the
authorities
did
attempt
to
execute
them
the
people
rose
and
compelled
them
to
desist
a
political
club
or
confederacy
was
organized
among
the
nobility
for
the
express
purpose
of
resisting
the
establishment
of
the
inquisition
they
bound
themselves
by
a
solemn
oath
to
oppose
the
introduction
of
the
inquisition
whether
it
were
attempted
openly
or
secretly
or
by
whatever
name
it
should
be
called
and
also
to
protect
and
defend
each
other
from
all
the
consequences
which
might
result
from
their
having
formed
this
league
perplexed
and
alarmed
the
regent
implored
the
prince
of
orange
and
his
two
associates
counts
egmont
and
horn
to
return
to
the
council
and
give
her
their
advice
they
did
so
and
a
speech
of
the
prince
of
orange
in
which
he
asserted
strongly
the
utter
folly
of
attempting
to
suppress
opinion
by
force
and
argued
that
such
is
the
nature
of
heresy
that
if
it
rests
it
rusts
but
whoever
rubs
it
whets
it
had
the
effect
of
inclining
the
regent
to
mitigate
the
ferocity
of
her
former
edicts
meanwhile
the
confederates
were
becoming
bolder
and
more
numerous
assembling
in
great
numbers
at
brussels
they
walked
in
procession
through
the
streets
to
the
palace
of
the
regent
where
they
were
admitted
to
an
interview
in
reply
to
their
petition
she
said
she
was
willing
to
send
one
or
more
persons
to
spain
to
lay
the
complaint
before
the
king
while
the
nobles
and
influential
persons
were
thus
preparing
to
in
case
of
a
collision
with
the
spanish
government
a
sudden
and
disastrous
movement
occurred
among
the
lower
classes
it
was
stated
and
believed
that
the
regent
had
given
permission
for
the
exercise
of
the
protestant
form
of
worship
and
throughout
flanders
multitudes
poured
into
the
fields
after
the
preachers
the
reaction
after
the
suppression
of
the
previous
years
was
very
great
and
the
emotions
were
easily
kindled
into
rage
against
the
catholics
led
on
by
fanatics
the
ignorant
masses
made
a
concerted
attack
upon
the
catholic
churches
shattering
their
windows
tearing
up
their
pavements
and
destroying
all
the
objects
of
art
which
they
contained
the
cathedral
at
antwerp
was
the
special
object
of
attack
and
it
was
reduced
to
an
almost
hopeless
ruin
the
patriot
nobles
exerted
their
influence
and
at
last
succeeded
in
suppressing
the
violence
and
in
restoring
order
before
the
news
of
this
outburst
had
reached
spain
philip
had
resolved
to
crush
the
confederacy
and
break
the
proud
spirit
of
the
netherlands
secret
orders
were
given
for
the
collection
of
troops
the
regent
was
instructed
to
amuse
the
patriots
until
the
means
of
punishing
them
were
ready
and
in
a
short
time
it
was
hoped
that
there
would
no
longer
be
a
patriot
or
a
heretic
in
the
low
countries
it
is
easy
to
conceive
with
what
rage
and
bitterness
of
heart
philip
while
indulging
these
dreams
must
have
received
intelligence
of
the
terrible
doings
of
the
iconoclasts
but
as
cautious
and
dissimulating
as
he
was
obstinate
and
revengeful
he
concealed
his
intentions
in
the
mean
time
announced
them
to
the
regent
only
in
secret
letters
and
dispatches
and
held
out
hopes
in
public
to
the
patriots
and
people
of
the
netherlands
that
he
was
soon
to
pay
them
a
visit
in
person
to
inquire
into
the
condition
of
affairs
william
had
secret
intelligence
of
the
purpose
of
philip
in
time
to
avert
its
worst
consequences
the
man
whom
philip
sent
into
the
netherlands
at
the
head
of
the
army
as
a
fit
instrument
of
his
purpose
of
vengeance
was
the
duke
of
alva
a
personage
who
united
the
most
consummate
military
skill
with
the
disposition
of
a
ruffian
ready
to
undertake
any
enterprise
however
base
such
was
the
man
who
at
the
age
of
sixty
in
the
month
of
august
made
his
entry
into
the
netherlands
at
the
head
of
an
army
of
fifteen
thousand
men
one
of
his
first
acts
was
the
arrest
of
the
counts
egmont
and
horn
the
regent
resigned
and
alva
was
left
in
supreme
control
now
ensued
the
grand
struggle
in
the
netherlands
on
the
one
hand
was
a
nation
of
quiet
orderly
people
industrious
in
a
high
degree
prosperous
in
their
commerce
and
disposed
to
remain
peaceful
subjects
to
a
foreign
monarch
on
the
other
hand
was
a
sovereign
who
unthankful
for
the
blessing
of
reigning
over
such
a
happy
and
nation
and
stimulated
by
passion
and
bigotry
resolved
on
compelling
all
to
submit
to
his
will
on
penalty
of
death
alva
at
once
commenced
his
persecutions
supported
by
his
army
blood
was
shed
like
water
the
inquisition
was
established
and
began
its
work
of
unspeakable
horrors
in
the
netherlands
patriots
and
protestants
in
crowds
left
the
country
the
leading
men
of
the
netherlands
were
arrested
and
executed
under
circumstances
of
extreme
ferocity
counts
egmont
and
horn
were
beheaded
at
brussels
overwhelming
taxes
were
imposed
upon
the
people
and
during
the
short
period
of
his
administration
alva
executed
eighteen
thousand
patriots
including
many
catholics
for
in
his
rage
against
the
free
spirit
of
the
netherlanders
he
recognized
no
distinction
in
condition
or
in
religious
belief
in
the
mean
time
the
prince
of
orange
was
active
in
devising
means
to
liberate
his
unfortunate
country
from
the
terrible
scourge
to
which
it
was
subjected
for
five
years
he
battled
incessantly
against
the
spanish
power
now
he
entered
into
combination
with
the
english
and
now
with
the
french
with
the
vain
hope
of
obtaining
a
sufficient
force
to
drive
the
spaniards
out
of
the
country
twice
he
raised
an
army
and
marched
to
the
aid
of
the
brave
burghers
who
still
maintained
their
independence
and
both
times
was
defeated
by
the
superior
force
and
generalship
of
alva
he
organized
a
fleet
which
ravaged
the
coast
captured
vessels
laden
with
provisions
for
army
and
defended
the
ports
within
reach
of
their
guns
when
the
shattered
remains
of
william
last
army
retreated
across
the
german
frontier
it
seemed
that
the
people
of
the
netherlands
were
about
to
be
left
to
their
fate
but
sixty
cities
and
towns
were
now
in
revolt
and
unless
they
were
recovered
philip
could
no
longer
be
considered
the
king
of
the
netherlands
nothing
was
left
but
the
slow
process
of
siege
operations
haarlem
held
out
seven
months
and
cost
the
spaniards
ten
thousand
men
it
surrendered
at
last
under
the
promise
of
an
amnesty
to
its
defenders
when
they
were
murdered
by
thousands
in
cold
blood
but
philip
was
dissatisfied
with
alva
for
his
slow
progress
and
for
his
execution
of
catholics
as
well
as
protestants
and
in
after
five
years
rule
he
recalled
him
and
with
characteristic
ingratitude
neglected
and
him
for
his
faithful
but
bloody
services
don
luis
requesens
succeeded
the
duke
of
alva
as
governor
of
the
netherlands
and
as
commander
of
the
spanish
army
while
a
zealous
catholic
he
seems
to
have
been
a
much
more
humane
and
just
man
than
alva
he
began
his
administration
by
abolishing
the
most
obnoxious
measures
of
his
predecessor
thus
changing
the
whole
tone
of
the
government
had
he
been
left
to
follow
his
own
counsels
in
everything
he
doubtless
would
have
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
prince
of
orange
and
established
peace
upon
a
permanent
basis
but
the
king
was
obstinately
determined
to
capture
the
revolted
cities
and
punish
his
rebel
subjects
and
the
general
was
obliged
to
continue
the
war
at
this
time
william
was
besieging
middleburg
on
the
island
of
zealand
and
one
of
the
first
acts
of
the
governor
was
to
raise
the
siege
to
this
end
he
caused
a
large
fleet
to
be
assembled
and
under
the
command
of
two
experienced
admirals
he
sent
it
down
the
scheldt
to
the
relief
of
middleburg
the
prince
of
orange
immediately
hastened
to
the
critical
spot
and
gave
direction
to
patriot
operations
the
holland
ships
were
collected
and
a
great
naval
battle
took
place
on
january
although
their
force
was
much
the
greater
the
spaniards
had
little
chance
upon
the
water
in
a
contest
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
low
countries
the
smaller
vessels
of
the
prince
of
orange
fell
upon
the
spanish
fleet
with
a
ferocity
which
they
could
not
withstand
and
the
result
was
a
complete
victory
with
the
destruction
of
their
principal
vessels
middleburg
soon
after
surrendered
to
the
patriots
and
the
sway
of
william
over
the
maritime
provinces
was
rendered
complete
in
april
an
army
from
germany
raised
through
the
influence
of
the
prince
of
orange
and
commanded
by
his
brother
count
henry
of
nassau
marched
into
the
low
countries
but
the
spaniards
dominated
the
land
as
the
dutch
the
sea
and
the
relief
array
was
defeated
and
count
henry
was
killed
this
defeat
however
to
the
patriot
cause
was
almost
equal
to
a
victory
the
spanish
troops
who
had
long
been
without
pay
became
mutinous
and
unmanageable
and
before
they
could
be
appeased
much
precious
time
was
lost
the
prince
of
orange
made
the
best
use
of
this
time
the
revolted
cities
were
strengthened
and
supplied
with
provisions
and
every
preparation
made
for
both
defensive
and
offensive
war
but
best
of
all
the
dutch
admiral
boldly
sailed
up
the
scheldt
captured
forty
of
the
spanish
vessels
and
sunk
many
more
at
length
the
spanish
general
was
once
more
ready
to
continue
his
aggressive
movements
and
he
proceeded
to
lay
siege
to
the
populous
city
of
leyden
the
story
of
this
siege
is
one
of
the
most
in
the
annals
of
heroism
leyden
stands
in
a
low
situation
in
the
midst
of
a
labyrinth
of
rivulets
and
canals
that
branch
of
the
rhine
which
still
retains
the
name
of
its
upper
course
passes
through
the
middle
of
it
and
front
this
stream
such
an
infinity
of
canals
are
derived
that
it
is
difficult
to
say
whether
the
water
or
the
land
possesses
the
greater
space
by
these
canals
the
ground
on
which
the
city
stands
is
divided
into
a
great
number
of
small
islands
united
together
by
bridges
for
five
months
all
other
operations
were
suspended
all
the
energy
of
requesens
on
the
one
hand
was
directed
toward
getting
possession
of
the
city
and
all
the
energy
of
the
prince
of
orange
on
the
other
hand
toward
assisting
the
citizens
and
preventing
it
from
being
taken
the
issue
depended
entirely
however
on
the
bravery
and
resolution
of
the
citizens
of
leyden
themselves
pent
up
within
their
walls
they
had
to
resist
the
attacks
and
stratagems
of
the
besiegers
and
all
that
the
prince
of
orange
could
do
was
to
occupy
the
surrounding
country
harass
the
besiegers
as
much
as
possible
and
enable
the
citizens
to
hold
out
by
conveying
to
them
supplies
of
provisions
and
men
there
was
not
in
the
city
a
single
scion
of
a
noble
family
there
were
no
men
trained
to
military
operations
it
was
a
city
of
artisans
and
tradesmen
and
the
spaniards
expected
scarcely
more
than
a
show
of
resistance
from
a
foe
so
ignoble
as
well
might
the
sheep
resist
a
pack
of
ravening
wolves
as
the
men
of
the
and
workshop
resist
the
best
trained
soldiers
of
europe
but
nobly
nay
up
to
the
highest
heroic
pitch
of
human
nature
did
the
citizens
behave
they
had
to
endure
a
siege
in
its
most
dreary
form
that
of
a
blockade
instead
of
attempting
to
storm
the
town
valdez
the
spanish
general
resolved
to
reduce
it
by
the
slow
process
of
starvation
for
this
purpose
he
completely
surrounded
the
town
by
a
circle
of
forts
more
than
sixty
in
number
and
the
inhabitants
thus
saw
themselves
walled
completely
in
from
the
rest
of
the
earth
with
its
growing
crops
and
its
granaries
and
restricted
entirely
to
whatever
quantity
of
provisions
there
happened
to
be
on
the
small
spot
of
ground
on
which
they
walked
up
and
down
their
only
means
of
communication
with
the
prince
of
orange
was
by
trained
for
the
purpose
one
attempt
was
made
by
them
to
break
through
the
line
of
blockade
for
the
sake
of
keeping
possession
of
a
piece
of
for
their
cattle
but
it
was
unsuccessful
and
they
began
now
to
work
day
and
night
in
repairing
their
fortifications
so
as
to
resist
the
spanish
batteries
when
they
should
begin
to
play
like
fire
pent
up
the
patriotism
of
the
inhabitants
burned
more
fiercely
and
brightly
every
man
became
a
hero
every
woman
an
orator
and
words
of
flashing
genius
were
spoken
and
deeds
of
wild
bravery
done
such
as
would
have
been
impossible
except
among
twenty
thousand
human
beings
living
in
the
same
city
and
all
roused
at
once
to
the
same
unnatural
pitch
of
emotion
the
two
leading
spirits
were
john
van
der
dors
the
commander
better
known
by
his
latinized
name
of
dousa
and
peter
van
der
werf
the
burgomaster
plebeian
names
these
but
loftier
natures
never
possessed
the
hearts
of
kings
or
nobles
beside
their
deeds
the
chivalry
of
knighthood
looks
trivial
and
mean
under
the
management
of
these
two
men
every
precaution
was
adopted
for
the
defense
of
the
city
the
resolution
come
to
was
that
the
last
man
among
them
should
die
of
want
rather
than
admit
the
spaniards
into
the
town
coolly
and
with
a
foresight
thoroughly
dutch
dousa
and
van
der
werf
set
about
making
an
inventory
of
all
that
was
eatable
in
the
town
corn
cattle
nay
even
horses
and
dogs
calculating
how
long
the
stock
could
last
at
the
rate
of
so
much
a
day
to
every
man
and
woman
in
the
city
adopting
means
to
get
the
whole
placed
under
the
management
of
a
dispensing
committee
and
deciding
what
should
be
the
allowance
per
head
at
first
so
as
to
prevent
their
stock
from
being
eaten
up
too
fast
it
was
impossible
however
to
collect
all
the
food
into
one
fund
or
to
regulate
its
consumption
by
municipal
arrangements
and
after
two
months
had
elapsed
famine
bad
commenced
in
earnest
and
those
devices
for
mitigating
the
gnawings
of
hunger
began
to
be
employed
which
none
but
starving
men
would
think
of
not
only
the
flesh
of
dogs
and
horses
but
roots
weeds
nettles
everything
green
that
the
eye
could
detect
shooting
up
from
the
earth
was
ravenously
eaten
many
died
of
want
and
thousands
fell
ill
still
they
held
out
and
indignantly
rejected
the
offers
made
to
them
by
the
besiegers
when
we
have
nothing
else
said
dousa
in
reply
to
a
message
from
valdez
we
will
eat
our
left
hands
keeping
the
right
to
fight
with
once
indeed
hunger
seemed
to
overcome
patriotism
and
for
some
days
crowds
of
gaunt
and
famished
wretches
moved
along
the
streets
crying
let
the
spaniards
in
for
god
sake
let
them
in
assembling
with
hoarse
clamor
at
the
house
of
van
der
werf
they
demanded
that
he
should
give
them
food
or
surrender
i
have
no
food
to
give
you
was
the
burgomaster
reply
and
i
have
sworn
that
i
will
not
surrender
to
the
spaniards
but
if
my
body
will
be
of
any
service
to
you
tear
me
in
pieces
and
let
the
hungriest
of
you
eat
me
the
poor
wretches
went
away
and
thought
no
more
of
surrendering
the
thought
of
the
prince
of
orange
night
and
day
was
how
to
render
assistance
to
the
citizens
of
leyden
how
to
convey
provisions
into
the
town
he
had
collected
a
large
supply
but
with
all
his
exertions
could
not
raise
a
sufficient
force
to
break
through
the
blockade
in
this
desperate
extremity
the
dutch
resolved
to
have
recourse
to
that
expedient
which
they
had
kept
in
reserve
until
it
should
be
clear
that
no
other
was
left
they
would
break
their
dikes
open
their
sluices
inundate
the
whole
level
country
around
leyden
and
wash
the
spaniards
and
their
forts
utterly
away
it
was
truly
a
desperate
measure
and
it
was
only
in
the
last
extremity
that
they
could
bring
themselves
to
think
of
it
all
that
fertile
land
which
the
labor
of
ages
had
drained
and
cultivated
to
see
it
converted
into
a
sheet
of
water
there
could
not
possibly
be
a
sight
more
unseemly
and
melancholy
to
a
dutchman
eyes
but
when
the
measure
was
once
resolved
upon
they
set
to
work
with
a
heartiness
and
zeal
greater
than
that
which
had
attended
their
building
hatchets
hammers
spades
and
pickaxes
were
in
requisition
and
by
the
labor
of
a
single
night
the
work
of
ages
was
demolished
and
undone
the
water
availing
itself
of
the
new
inlets
poured
over
the
flat
country
and
in
a
short
time
the
whole
of
the
region
between
leyden
and
rotterdam
was
flooded
the
spaniards
at
first
resolved
upon
immediate
flight
but
seeing
that
the
water
did
not
rise
above
a
certain
level
they
recovered
their
courage
and
though
obliged
to
abandon
their
forts
which
were
stationed
upon
the
low
grounds
they
persevered
in
the
blockade
but
there
was
another
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
inundation
of
the
country
beside
that
of
washing
away
the
spaniards
and
the
prince
of
orange
made
preparations
for
effecting
it
he
had
caused
two
hundred
boats
to
be
built
and
loaded
with
provisions
these
now
began
to
row
toward
the
famished
city
the
inhabitants
saw
them
coming
they
watched
them
eagerly
advancing
across
the
waters
fighting
their
way
past
the
spanish
forts
and
bringing
bread
to
them
but
it
seemed
as
if
heaven
itself
had
become
cruel
for
a
north
wind
was
blowing
and
so
long
as
it
continued
to
blow
the
waters
would
not
be
deep
enough
for
the
boats
to
reach
the
city
they
waited
for
days
every
eye
fixed
on
the
vanes
but
still
the
wind
continued
in
the
north
though
never
within
the
memory
of
the
oldest
citizen
had
it
blown
in
that
direction
so
long
at
that
time
of
year
many
died
in
sight
of
the
vessels
that
contained
the
food
which
would
have
kept
them
alive
and
those
who
survived
shuffled
along
the
streets
living
skeletons
instead
of
men
but
the
sea
did
not
at
last
desert
the
brave
men
who
had
so
long
dominated
it
at
the
last
extremity
it
roused
itself
and
swept
down
in
its
might
upon
the
doomed
spaniards
when
but
two
days
stood
between
the
starving
citizens
and
death
lo
the
vanes
trembled
and
veered
round
the
wind
shifted
first
to
the
northwest
blowing
the
with
hurricane
force
into
the
mouth
of
the
rivers
and
then
to
the
south
driving
the
waters
directly
toward
the
city
the
remaining
forts
of
the
spaniards
were
quickly
begirt
with
water
the
spaniards
themselves
pursued
by
the
zealanders
in
their
boats
were
either
drowned
or
shot
swimming
or
fished
out
with
hooks
fastened
to
the
end
of
poles
and
killed
with
the
sword
several
bodies
of
them
however
effected
their
escape
the
citizens
had
all
crowded
at
the
gates
to
meet
their
deliverers
with
bread
in
their
hands
they
ran
through
the
streets
and
many
who
had
outlived
the
famine
died
of
surfeit
the
same
day
they
met
in
one
of
the
churches
a
lean
and
sickly
congregation
with
the
magistrates
at
their
head
to
return
thanks
to
almighty
god
for
his
mercy
the
citizens
of
leyden
had
performed
their
duty
nobly
and
well
it
was
a
triple
service
they
had
driven
away
from
their
city
the
hated
spaniard
they
had
secured
the
freedom
of
their
country
and
they
had
preserved
liberty
for
mankind
no
nobler
deeds
are
chronicled
in
all
history
than
this
long
battle
with
death
than
this
silent
uncomplaining
endurance
during
the
long
weeks
while
the
succors
were
delayed
by
adverse
winds
as
a
recompense
to
the
people
of
leyden
for
their
heroic
conduct
the
prince
of
orange
gave
them
the
choice
of
exemption
from
taxes
for
a
certain
number
of
years
or
of
having
a
university
established
in
the
city
and
much
to
their
honor
they
preferred
the
latter
the
university
of
leyden
was
accordingly
established
in
at
one
time
it
attained
so
high
a
reputation
for
learning
that
leyden
was

chapter
vii
invincible
in
the
invincible
armada
sailed
from
spain
into
the
high
seas
to
understand
the
nature
of
this
formidable
naval
armament
and
the
reasons
for
its
sailing
we
must
take
a
brief
survey
of
the
condition
of
europe
at
this
period
of
the
world
history
spain
before
the
armada
at
this
time
spain
was
the
most
powerful
of
the
monarchies
of
europe
many
causes
had
conspired
to
give
her
this
about
one
hundred
years
before
the
two
principal
provinces
castile
and
aragon
were
united
by
the
marriage
of
their
sovereigns
isabella
and
ferdinand
in
the
aloors
were
subjugated
uniting
the
whole
peninsula
under
one
government
in
the
same
year
under
the
auspices
of
the
spanish
sovereigns
columbus
discovered
the
new
world
giving
additional
luster
to
the
spanish
name
and
a
new
impulse
to
spanish
adventure
thirty
years
later
mexico
and
peru
had
been
overrun
and
plundered
by
cortes
and
pizarro
and
the
treasures
of
millions
of
people
accumulated
through
many
centuries
became
a
possession
of
the
spanish
people
raising
them
to
a
degree
of
opulence
unknown
since
the
time
of
the
most
illustrious
of
the
roman
emperors
in
consequence
of
this
wealth
commerce
expanded
large
cities
grew
up
along
the
courses
of
the
navigable
rivers
and
all
branches
of
industry
were
aroused
to
a
state
of
great
activity
in
spain
and
austria
were
united
under
the
emperor
charles
v
grandson
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
and
during
his
reign
the
united
kingdoms
arose
to
a
height
of
power
almost
equal
to
that
of
the
empire
of
charlemagne
the
dominion
of
charles
extended
from
the
atlantic
to
the
steppes
of
poland
and
from
the
mediterranean
to
the
baltic
it
included
all
of
western
continental
europe
except
france
and
southern
italy
in
charles
abdicated
his
throne
and
divided
his
empire
giving
austria
and
germany
to
his
brother
ferdinand
and
spain
and
the
low
countries
of
holland
and
belgium
to
his
son
philip
ii
spain
was
now
rich
and
powerful
her
armies
were
large
and
were
commanded
by
the
most
experienced
military
officers
of
europe
material
progress
showed
itself
on
every
side
the
richest
commerce
of
the
world
poured
its
wealth
into
her
ports
a
new
intellectual
life
was
aroused
which
found
expression
in
literature
and
schools
all
the
conditions
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
spanish
people
were
about
to
lead
europe
in
the
direction
of
a
higher
civilization
character
and
policy
of
philip
ii
but
soon
all
this
changed
philip
was
vain
bigoted
and
ambitious
in
his
administration
of
public
affairs
he
seemed
to
have
but
two
objects
in
view
to
augment
spanish
power
and
to
cause
his
own
religious
creed
to
be
universally
accepted
to
promote
these
objects
he
had
no
scruples
in
regard
to
means
his
own
people
were
tortured
and
executed
by
the
thousand
by
this
savage
policy
he
stamped
out
heresy
placed
freedom
of
thought
under
a
ban
and
put
an
end
to
the
intellectual
progress
of
the
country
in
his
dealings
with
other
nations
his
diplomacy
included
all
the
arts
of
chicanery
and
deceit
two
formidable
obstacles
stood
in
the
way
of
the
realization
of
his
plans
heretical
england
had
become
a
strong
naval
power
and
english
ships
captured
his
laden
with
the
spoils
of
the
countries
lie
had
plundered
the
eagles
of
the
sea
despoiled
the
wolves
of
the
main
of
their
gains
the
second
trouble
was
nearer
home
the
people
of
the
low
countries
revolted
alike
from
his
government
and
his
creed
to
remove
these
obstacles
was
the
first
step
toward
the
attainment
of
his
larger
ambitions
in
regard
to
england
philip
ventured
upon
a
of
policy
he
sought
the
hand
of
mary
the
newly
crowned
queen
of
england
and
married
her
by
this
step
lie
hoped
and
expected
to
extinguish
dissent
in
england
as
he
had
done
in
his
own
dominions
to
gradually
usurp
the
government
and
to
make
english
naval
supremacy
subserve
the
interests
of
spain
but
philip
was
sorely
disappointed
mary
though
narrow
and
bigoted
and
at
one
with
hire
in
creed
had
still
english
blood
in
her
and
english
independence
had
been
sturdily
maintained
through
too
many
centuries
to
be
surrendered
to
any
power
or
on
any
pretext
the
english
parliament
also
interfered
and
refused
to
crown
him
jointly
with
mary
so
philip
found
himself
united
to
a
sickly
peevish
wife
of
twice
his
age
and
entirely
powerless
to
effect
the
purposes
he
had
in
view
three
or
four
years
passed
in
fruitless
intrigue
punishments
for
heresy
were
frequent
but
the
fires
of
persecution
never
blazed
so
fiercely
in
the
cooler
atmosphere
of
england
as
in
spain
and
the
victims
of
the
stake
could
be
counted
singly
instead
of
by
the
thousand
then
mary
died
and
elizabeth
ascended
the
throne
of
england
the
new
queen
declined
the
honor
of
philip
hand
which
was
tendered
her
and
she
zealously
espoused
the
cause
of
the
english
church
the
hunted
turned
hunters
and
the
last
fires
of
english
persecution
were
lit
by
those
whom
the
stake
had
threatened
all
through
the
dreary
years
of
mary
reign
this
change
of
front
and
the
gradual
amelioration
of
penalties
which
followed
show
that
persecutions
are
not
the
monopoly
of
any
sect
but
are
rather
the
manifestations
of
an
irresponsible
power
in
a
age
philip
retired
angry
and
disgusted
the
contemptuous
refusal
of
his
hand
by
elizabeth
was
a
terrible
shock
to
his
personal
pride
the
triumph
of
the
new
church
inflamed
his
bigotry
and
the
sturdy
independence
of
the
english
people
was
a
severe
blow
to
his
pride
of
country
he
brooded
over
the
situation
and
determined
to
resent
the
slights
personal
and
public
which
had
been
put
upon
him
from
his
purpose
he
was
for
a
time
diverted
by
the
attitude
of
his
rebellious
subjects
in
belgium
maddened
to
ferocity
by
the
failure
of
his
plans
he
devoted
the
whole
people
to
destruction
and
he
sent
his
armies
under
the
terrible
duke
of
alva
to
devastate
the
cities
of
the
dikes
as
pizarro
had
destroyed
the
homes
of
the
incas
after
innumerable
atrocities
and
the
wholesale
slaughter
of
men
women
and
children
the
remnant
of
freedom
was
preserved
by
the
obstinacy
of
the
dutch
burghers
the
wise
policy
of
william
the
silent
the
aid
of
the
sea
and
the
succor
furnished
by
elizabeth
illustration
spanish
here
again
was
practical
defeat
his
cherished
purposes
were
thwarted
and
the
high
hope
of
his
life
was
gone
nothing
was
left
but
despair
and
revenge
at
this
time
philip
began
to
exhibit
in
a
marked
degree
the
madness
which
overshadowed
the
last
years
of
his
life
his
hatred
of
england
grew
from
day
to
day
and
at
last
took
shape
in
a
determination
to
make
one
supreme
effort
to
conquer
his
rival
and
to
check
the
rising
free
thought
of
the
english
people
for
years
the
preparations
went
on
for
the
great
conflict
and
in
twenty
years
after
the
accession
of
elizabeth
to
the
throne
everything
was
ready
england
power
to
resist
the
armada
and
what
of
england
and
of
her
ability
to
resist
this
formidable
attack
for
a
hundred
years
before
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
civil
wars
of
the
roses
had
desolated
the
country
and
put
an
end
to
national
growth
for
the
next
fifty
years
and
until
the
commencement
of
the
reign
of
elizabeth
violence
and
bloodshed
were
so
common
that
the
population
barely
maintained
its
own
in
the
whole
number
of
people
in
england
and
wales
was
estimated
at
four
millions
about
one
third
of
the
population
of
spain
but
england
possessed
two
elements
of
strength
her
people
although
differing
in
creed
and
often
warring
with
one
another
were
intensely
patriotic
and
were
united
as
one
man
against
a
foreign
foe
and
the
ships
of
england
manned
by
english
crews
and
commanded
by
her
great
captains
the
legitimate
successors
of
the
old
vikings
dominated
the
seas
no
enterprise
was
too
hazardous
for
these
hardy
mariners
to
undertake
and
no
disparity
of
force
ever
induced
them
to
pause
philip
was
often
wrought
to
frenzy
as
he
saw
these
bold
corsairs
capture
his
and
ravage
his
coasts
in
sight
of
his
invincible
but
impotent
armies
the
mode
of
attack
which
philip
determined
upon
consisted
of
two
distinct
but
movements
a
formidable
army
of
invasion
under
the
duke
of
parma
the
most
experienced
and
skillful
commander
in
europe
was
stationed
at
the
several
ports
of
the
low
countries
opposite
the
british
coast
from
dunkirk
east
innumerable
transports
were
provided
to
convey
this
host
across
the
channel
and
once
on
english
ground
an
easy
and
triumphant
march
to
london
was
expected
the
second
part
of
the
grand
expedition
consisted
of
an
immense
fleet
of
the
largest
vessels
ever
built
under
the
command
of
the
duke
of
medina
sidonia
which
was
to
drive
away
the
english
ships
and
convoy
the
army
of
parma
to
the
english
shore
this
fleet
was
christened
by
the
spaniards
the
invincible
armada
philip
hastened
his
preparations
with
all
the
energy
he
could
command
in
every
port
resounded
the
axe
and
hammer
of
the
in
every
arsenal
blazed
the
flames
of
busy
forges
all
spanish
europe
echoed
with
the
din
of
arms
provisions
were
amassed
in
a
thousand
granaries
soldiers
were
daily
mustered
on
the
drilled
and
accustomed
to
the
use
of
arquebus
and
cannon
carts
and
wagons
were
built
in
hundreds
for
the
conveyance
of
stores
spades
mattocks
and
baskets
were
got
ready
for
the
pioneers
iron
and
brass
ordnance
were
cast
and
leaden
shot
melted
in
enormous
quantities
nor
were
the
instruments
of
torture
the
and
the
daughter
forgotten
in
the
preparations
were
nearly
completed
and
the
armada
was
about
ready
to
sail
when
a
knowledge
of
its
destination
became
known
to
sir
francis
drake
the
great
english
commander
without
considering
the
disparity
of
force
the
old
with
a
fleet
of
vessels
made
a
sudden
descent
upon
the
port
of
cadiz
where
the
ships
of
the
armada
were
at
anchor
many
of
the
larger
vessels
escaped
by
taking
refuge
under
the
guns
of
the
forts
but
the
city
was
lit
up
by
the
blaze
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
burning
ships
and
the
great
enterprise
was
delayed
for
another
year
sailing
of
the
armada
but
this
disaster
only
called
forth
greater
exertions
the
maimed
vessels
were
repaired
new
ones
were
built
and
at
length
one
hundred
and
ships
many
of
them
the
largest
ever
known
at
the
time
were
ready
to
sail
they
carried
three
thousand
guns
and
thirty
thousand
men
on
may
the
armada
sailed
from
the
mouth
of
the
tagus
but
a
great
gale
dispersed
the
ships
and
obliged
them
to
put
back
into
port
to
repair
surely
god
did
not
smile
upon
the
beginning
of
a
warfare
carried
on
in
his
name
it
was
not
until
july
that
the
fleet
finally
sailed
from
corunna
on
its
mission
of
destruction
and
to
meet
its
fate
to
cope
with
this
formidable
force
the
whole
british
navy
could
muster
only
vessels
all
much
smaller
than
the
largest
of
the
spanish
ships
but
in
consideration
of
the
great
danger
merchants
and
private
gentlemen
fitted
out
vessels
at
their
own
expense
and
by
midsummer
a
fleet
of
one
hundred
and
ships
was
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
british
admiral
in
tonnage
number
of
guns
and
number
of
men
the
strength
of
the
whole
fleet
was
about
one
half
that
of
the
armada
but
all
england
was
aroused
for
more
than
five
centuries
this
was
the
first
foreign
invasion
that
had
threatened
her
shores
the
years
of
preparation
had
given
time
for
the
avowed
purposes
of
philip
to
become
known
throughout
the
kingdom
there
was
anxiety
everywhere
for
no
one
knew
where
and
when
the
blow
was
to
be
struck
but
there
was
no
thought
of
submission
and
all
england
stood
alert
eagerly
watching
and
waiting
much
to
philip
disappointment
and
chagrin
the
great
catholic
families
of
england
rallied
to
their
country
defense
as
readily
as
their
protestant
neighbors
and
all
englishmen
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
this
supreme
moment
of
the
nation
peril
vessels
patrolled
the
shores
to
give
notice
of
the
coming
ships
soldiers
drilled
in
every
hamlet
and
on
the
piles
of
fagots
were
placed
so
that
might
speedily
send
the
news
to
the
remotest
parts
of
the
kingdom
waiting
for
the
armada
canon
kingsley
has
given
a
graphic
picture
of
england
great
naval
commanders
when
the
news
was
received
that
the
armada
was
off
the
coast
he

assembled
at

on
the
of

the
face
of
each
speaker
his
cap
is
in
his
hand
so
you
can
see
the
of
crisp
brown
hair
and
the
wrinkled
forehead
as
well
as
the
high
the
short
square
face
the
broad
temples
the
thick
lips
which
are
yet
as
firm
as
granite
a
coarse
plebeian
stump
of
a
man
yet
the
whole
figure
and
attitude
are
those
of
boundless
determination
energy
and
when
at
last
he
speaks
a
few
blunt
words
all
eyes
are
turned
respectfully
on
him
for
his
name
is
francis
drake
a
burly
grizzled
elder
in
greasy
garments
contrasting
oddly
with
the
huge
gold
chain
about
his
neck
waddles
up
as
if
he
had
been
born
and
had
lived
ever
since
in
a
gale
of
wind
at
sea
the
upper
half
of
his
sharp
dogged
visage
seems
of
a
leather
the
brow
of
badger
fur
and
as
he
claps
drake
on
the
back
with
a
broad
devon
accent
he
shouts
you
to
drink
your
wine
francis
drake
or
be
you
not
saving
your
presence
my
lord
the
lord
high
admiral
only
laughs
and
bids
drake
go
and
drink
his
wine
for
john
hawkins
admiral
of
the
fleet
is
the
patriarch
of
plymouth
seamen
if
drake
is
the
hero
so
they
push
through
the
crowd
wherein
is
many
another
man
whom
we
would
gladly
have
spoken
with
face
to
face
on
earth
martin
frobisher
and
john
davis
are
sitting
on
that
bench
smoking
tobacco
from
long
silver
pipes
and
by
them
are
fenton
and
wishington
who
have
both
tried
to
follow
drake
path
around
the
world
and
failed
though
by
no
fault
of
their
own
the
short
prim
man
in
the
huge
yellow
ruff
is
richard
hawkins
the
admiral
hereafter
famous
son
but
hark
the
boom
of
a
single
gun
seaward
directs
the
attention
of
every
one
to
a
small
armed
vessel
staggering
up
the
sound
under
a
press
of
canvas
a
boat
puts
off
its
oars
flash
quickly
in
the
sun
the
captain
lands
and
inquiring
for
the
lord
high
admiral
is
quickly
brought
into
his
presence
he
has
discovered
the
formidable
array
of
the
spaniards
bearing
down
with
the
wind
like
so
many
floating
castles
the
ocean
seeming
to
groan
under
the
weight
of
their
heavy
burdens
the
lord
high
admiral
proposes
to
hold
counsel
with
his
principal
officers
but
says
drake
with
a
hearty
laugh
us
play
out
our
play
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
to
win
the
game
and
beat
the
spaniards
too
the
game
was
played
out
steadily
and
the
last
cast
having
been
thrown
drake
and
his
comrades
leaped
into
their
boats
and
rowed
swiftly
to
their
respective
ships
with
so
much
skill
did
howard
and
his
lieutenants
direct
the
movements
of
their
squadrons
that
before
morning
sixty
of
the
best
english
ships
had
warped
out
of
plymouth
harbor
how
the
news
spread
through
england
while
preparations
had
been
made
to
meet
the
armada
there
seems
to
have
been
a
half
expectation
on
the
part
of
the
government
that
something
would
occur
to
prevent
its
sailing
until
the
very
last
elizabeth
and
her
counselors
appeared
to
place
more
confidence
in
diplomacy
and
political
combinations
than
in
the
powers
of
sir
francis
drake
and
his
coadjutors
so
when
the
armada
was
seen
off
the
coast
the
were
kindled
and
the
whole
kingdom
was
soon
ablaze
the
stirring
verse
of
macaulay
best
describes
the
spread
of
the
news
the
alarm
the
anxiety
and
the
grand
uprising
of
the
whole
people
attend
all
ye
who
list
to
bear
our
noble
england
praise
i
tell
of
the
deeds
she
wrought
in
ancient
days
when
that
great
fleet
invincible
against
her
bore
in
vain
the
richest
spoils
of
mexico
the
stoutest
hearts
of
spain
it
was
about
the
lovely
close
of
a
warm
summer
day
there
carne
a
gallant

her
crew
hath
seen
castile

at

on

lie
heaving
many
a
mile
at

she
escaped
their

by
god
especial
grace
and
the
tall
pinta
till
the
noon
had
held
her
close
in

forthwith
a

placed
along

him
to
set
up
the
standard
of
her

at
once
on
all
her
stately
gates
arose
the
answering
fires
at
once
the
wild
alarum
clashed
from
all
her
reeling
spires
from
all
the
batteries
of
the
tower
pealed
loud
the
voice
of
fear
and
all
the
thousand
masts
of
thames
sent
back
a
louder
cheer
and
from
the
farthest
wards
was
heard
the
rush
of
hurrying
feet
and
the
broad
streams
of
pikes
and
flags
rushed
down
each
roaring
street
and
broader
still
became
the
blaze
and
louder
still
the
din
as
fast
from
every
village
round
the
horse
came
spurring
in
and
eastward
straight
from
wild
blackheath
the
warlike
errand
went
and
roused
in

the
gallant
squires
of

southward
from

pleasant
hills
flew
those
bright
couriers
forth
high
on
bleak
hampstead
swarthy
moor
they
started
for
the
north
and
on
and
on
without
a
pause
untired
they
bounded
still
all
night
from

they
sprang
they
sprang

the

that
burned
on

embattled
pile
and
the
red
glare
on

roused
the
burghers
of
carlisle
the
preliminary
skirmish
it
was
on
saturday
july
a
dull
misty
day
that
the
two
great
fleets
which
represented
the
cause
of
freedom
on
the
one
side
and
the
longing
after
universal
empire
on
the
other
came
in
sight
of
each
other
the
great
armada
with
its
huge
galleons
in
battle
array
extending
over
a
space
of
many
miles
was
suffered
to
sail
up
the
channel
past
plymouth
harbor
without
molestation
this
was
in
accordance
with
the
general
plan
of
attack
which
bad
been
agreed
upon
the
superior
force
of
the
spaniards
caused
no
fear
but
rather
a
grim
determination
to
overwhelm
and
destroy
the
universal
sentiment
that
seemed
to
prevail
among
all
classes
of
englishmen
concerning
their
country
finds
fitting
expression
in
the
words
which
shakespeare
puts
into
the
mouth
of
john
of
gaunt
this
royal
throne
of
kings
this
sceptered
isle
this
earth
of
majesty
this
seat
of
mars
this
other
eden
this
fortress
built
by
nature
for
herself
against
infection
and
the
hand
of
war
this
happy
breed
of
men
this
little
world
this
precious
stone
set
in
the
silver
sea
which
serves
it
in
the
office
of
a
wall
or
as
a
moat
defensive
to
a
house
against
the
envy
of
less
happier
lands
this
blessed
spot
this
earth
this
realm
this
england
dear
for
her
reputation
through
the
world
to
guard
this
favored
spot
and
to
protect
its
soil
from
the
polluting
footstep
of
the
hated
spaniard
mariners
went
forth
to
do
or
die
it
was
now
in
the
moment
of
supreme
peril
that
the
courage
hardihood
and
skill
of
england
great
navigators
gained
in
battle
with
the
elements
in
the
unknown
seas
of
the
north
and
west
and
in
many
a
strife
against
fearful
odds
with
their
spanish
foes
were
found
to
be
equal
to
the
occasion
and
sufficient
to
insure
the
safety
of
their
country
on
sunday
morning
july
the
english
ships
commenced
their
attacks
upon
their
unwieldy
antagonists
the
spanish
ships
says
motley
seemed
arrayed
for
a
pageant
in
honor
of
a
victory
won
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
crescent
whose
horns
were
seven
miles
asunder
those
gilded
towers
and
floating
castles
with
their
brilliant
standards
and
martial
music
bore
slowly
up
the
channel
the
admiral
the
duke
stood
in
his
private
tower
on
the
deck
of
his
great
galleon
the
saint
martin
surrounded
by
guards
of
infantry
and
captains
of
cavalry
no
better
acquainted
than
himself
with
naval
tactics
and
just
as
the
gaddy
hovers
about
and
stings
the
horse
which
is
all
unable
to
escape
from
its
tiny
enemy
so
round
the
heavy
galleons
and
unwieldy
ships
of
spain
the
light
english
vessels
commanded
by
able
and
experienced
seamen
hovered
with
the
utmost
freedom
their
superior
tactics
soon
obtained
the
advantage
of
the
wind
enabling
them
at
intervals
to
cannonade
their
enemies
with
great
effect
while
they
themselves
escaped
out
of
range
at
pleasure
and
easily
avoided
the
tremendous
discharge
of
the
spanish
ordnance
in
vain
the
golden
duke
attempted
to
bring
on
a
general
engagement
howard
and
drake
were
well
aware
that
in
a
fight
the
strongest
would
necessarily
conquer
and
that
their
only
hope
of
success
lay
in
keeping
close
upon
the
enemy
flanks
or
following
at
his
heels
cutting
off
a
stray
galleon
making
a
dash
into
his
squadrons
and
so
gradually
but
surely
reducing
his
strength
until
they
could
venture
to
give
him
battle
on
more
equal
terms
the
armada
fronde
says
made
sail
and
attempted
to
close
to
medina
sidonia
extreme
astonishment
it
seemed
at
the
pleasure
of
the
english
to
leave
him
or
allow
him
to
approach
them
as
they
chose
the
galleons
moved
like
thames
barges
piled
with
hay
while
the
sharp
low
english
ships
sailed
at
near
two
feet
to
the
spaniards
one
and
shot
away
as
if
by
magic
in
the
eye
of
the
wind
it
was
as
if
a
modern
steam
fleet
was
engaged
with
a
squadron
of
the
sailing
vessels
choosing
their
own
distance
and
fighting
or
not
fighting
as
suited
their
convenience
astonished
and
confounded
as
well
by
the
manoeuvring
as
by
the
rapidity
of
the
english
fire
the
spanish
officers
could
not
refuse
their
admiration
they
knew
they
were
inferior
at
sea
but
had
not
fully
realized
their
inferiority
notwithstanding
the
lessons
drake
hawkins
cavendish
and
others
had
already
taught
them
but
here
were
the
english
firing
four
shots
to
their
one
while
their
ships
were
so
nimble
that
with
a
fresh
breeze
even
the
swiftest
of
the
spanish
ships
could
not
touch
there
such
splendid
gunners
and
skillful
seamen
the
spaniards
had
never
seen
before
and
were
hardly
able
to
believe
in
their
existence
the
wind
was
from
the
west
so
that
the
english
fleet
were
able
to
keep
to
the
windward
giving
them
an
increased
advantage
over
their
antagonists
the
spanish
gunners
drafted
from
the
army
could
not
manage
the
naval
ordnance
and
their
shots
flew
high
and
scarcely
touched
the
english
ships
on
the
other
hand
the
spanish
vessels
were
riddled
with
shot
and
men
fell
killed
and
wounded
on
every
side
but
the
ships
were
too
strongly
built
to
be
easily
destroyed
and
so
the
monsters
continued
to
receive
fearful
blows
and
sailed
wearily
and
helplessly
on
toward
night
medina
sidonia
finding
it
impossible
to
bring
on
a
general
engagement
signaled
to
make
sail
up
the
channel
the
rear
to
be
covered
by
the
squadron
under
his
second
in
command
don
martinez
de
recaldi
the
wind
was
now
rising
and
promised
a
squally
evening
the
english
ships
withdrew
for
want
of
powder
an
express
was
sent
up
to
london
for
a
fresh
supply
a
fast
boat
was
dispatched
to
lord
harry
seymour
who
commanded
a
fleet
of
coasters
farther
up
the
channel
with
a
letter
reporting
progress
so
far
and
bidding
him
be
on
the
alert
but
the
misfortunes
of
the
spaniards
were
not
yet
over
the
capitana
one
of
their
largest
galleons
fouled
with
another
vessel
and
broke
her
she
fell
behind
and
was
left
to
her
fate
in
the
morning
drake
took
possession
of
her
and
found
many
casks
of
reals
and
what
was
of
more
importance
some
tons
of
gunpowder
with
which
the
roebuck
the
swiftest
traveler
of
the
fleet
flew
to
the
lord
admiral
shortly
after
dark
another
serious
accident
occurred
the
officers
of
one
of
the
great
galleons
impatient
and
irritated
at
the
results
of
the
action
were
quarreling
with
one
another
the
captain
struck
the
with
a
stick
the
gunner
who
was
from
holland
went
below
in
a
rage
thrust
a
burning
linstock
or
long
match
into
a
and
sprang
through
a
into
the
sea
the
deck
was
blown
off
from
stem
to
stern
two
hundred
seamen
and
soldiers
were
sent
into
the
air
some
fell
into
the
water
and
were
drowned
some
scorched
or
mutilated
dropped
back
into
the
wreck
the
ship
which
was
one
of
the
largest
in
the
fleet
was
built
so
strongly
that
she
survived
the
shock
and
at
the
english
took
possession
of
her
at
the
bottom
of
the
hold
were
many
barrels
of
powder
which
lord
howard
so
sorely
needed
the
progress
of
the
fight
on
the
morning
of
july
the
spanish
admiral
saw
the
remainder
of
the
english
fleet
coming
up
from
plymouth
harbor
and
he
made
all
sail
up
the
channel
owing
to
the
want
of
powder
the
attack
of
the
english
was
less
vigorous
than
on
the
day
before
but
still
they
dogged
the
spaniards
in
the
most
persevering
manner
and
succeeded
in
inflicting
serious
damage
upon
many
of
the
spanish
vessels
the
breeze
from
the
west
still
continued
but
it
was
light
and
the
fleets
made
but
little
headway
during
the
day
on
tuesday
july
a
strong
morning
breeze
sprang
up
from
the
east
and
the
spaniards
found
themselves
for
the
first
time
to
the
windward
taking
advantage
of
the
situation
they
bore
down
upon
the
english
fleet
and
tried
to
bring
on
a
general
engagement
this
challenge
the
english
would
not
accept
and
stood
out
to
sea
toward
the
west
the
spaniards
thought
they
were
retreating
and
gave
chase
all
the
galleons
were
bad
sailers
but
some
were
better
than
others
and
soon
the
san
marcus
outstripped
her
consorts
when
several
miles
ahead
of
all
her
companions
the
wind
shifted
to
the
west
leaving
the
english
to
the
windward
lord
howard
immediately
bore
down
in
his
the
ark
and
attacked
the
san
marcus
but
she
defended
herself
with
great
bravery
and
for
an
hour
and
a
half
fought
delivering
eighty
shots
and
receiving
five
hundred
his
powder
again
giving
out
lord
howard
was
obliged
to
withdraw
this
action
was
fought
off
plymouth
harbor
so
that
in
the
three
fight
the
armada
had
made
no
substantial
progress
toward
its
destination
by
this
time
the
news
that
the
armada
was
in
the
channel
had
circulated
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
england
and
from
every
creek
and
port
and
harbor
came
accession
of
goodly
ships
equipped
at
the
cost
of
leading
squires
and
nobles
and
manned
by
her
blood
from
lyme
and
weymouth
and
poole
and
the
isle
of
wight
young
lords
and
gentlemen
came
streaming
out
in
every
smack
or
sloop
they
could
lay
hold
of
to
snatch
their
share
of
danger
and
glory
at
howard
side
the
strength
which
they
were
able
to
add
was
little
or
nothing
but
they
brought
enthusiasm
they
brought
to
the
crews
the
sense
that
the
heart
of
all
england
was
with
them
and
this
assurance
transformed
every
seaman
into
a
hero
on
tuesday
evening
after
the
fight
medina
sidonia
counted
a
hundred
sail
behind
him
and
he
observed
with
some
uneasiness
that
the
numbers
were
continually
increasing
on
wednesday
july
the
weather
was
calm
and
the
english
lay
idle
at
a
short
distance
from
the
armada
waiting
for
powder
thursday
july
was
the
of
spain
patron
saint
jago
of
him
who
mounted
on
a
steed
had
ridden
in
of
battle
in
one
of
the
spanish
encounters
with
the
moors
and
had
led
them
to
victory
should
nothing
on
this
holy
day
be
done
in
his
honor
by
those
whom
he
had
so
greatly
favored
it
was
decided
to
make
an
attack
the
galleys
led
the
way
and
in
their
van
rode
three
of
the
four
great
galliasses
thrashing
the
sea
to
foam
with
three
hundred
oars
apiece
the
english
met
them
with
such
tremendous
discharges
of
that
had
not
the
wind
risen
about
noon
enabling
the
spanish
ships
to
come
up
to
their
assistance
the
galleys
would
surely
have
been
taken
when
the
lord
admiral
withdrew
his
ships
the
spaniards
were
so
cowed
that
they
made
no
attempt
to
pursue
them
thus
says
canon
kingsley
the
fight
had
thundered
on
the
afternoon
beneath
the
virgin
cliffs
of
freshwater
on
the
isle
of
wight
while
myriad
sea
fowl
rose
screaming
from
every
ledge
and
with
their
black
wings
spotted
the
walls
of
chalk
and
the
lone
shepherd
hurried
down
the
slopes
above
to
peer
over
the
dizzy
ledge
and
forgot
the
fluttering
in
his
snare
while
trembling
he
gazes
upon
glimpses
of
tall
masts
and
gorgeous
flags
piercing
at
times
the
veil
of
which
weltered
far
below
brief
respite
from
battle
friday
july
was
a
tranquil
summer
day
the
wind
died
away
and
the
two
fleets
but
a
few
miles
apart
lay
rocking
on
the
waves
the
duke
of
medina
sidonia
took
advantage
of
the
pause
and
sent
a
swift
messenger
to
the
prince
of
parma
praying
him
to
dispatch
to
his
assistance
forty
small
capable
of
contending
with
the
light
swift
craft
of
the
english
all
the
next
day
july
the
two
fleets
sailed
slowly
up
the
channel
in
hostile
but
silent
companionship
the
spaniard
convinced
he
could
not
meet
the
englishman
in
open
fight
the
englishman
heedful
that
he
should
not
be
surrounded
by
a
superior
force
at
night
the
battered
and
maltreated
armada
took
refuge
in
the
harbor
of
calais
the
same
afternoon
lord
howard
was
joined
by
sir
harry
seymour
with
his
squadron
of
sixteen
vessels
which
bad
been
keeping
watch
along
the
eastern
ports
and
the
combined
fleet
dropped
anchor
to
the
eastward
of
calais
and
within
a
mile
and
a
half
of
the
french
shore
never
since
england
was
england
says
motley
had
such
a
sight
been
seen
as
now
revealed
itself
in
those
narrow
straits
between
dover
and
calais
along
that
low
sandy
shore
and
quite
within
the
range
of
the
calais
fortifications
one
hundred
and
thirty
spanish
ships
the
greater
number
of
them
the
largest
and
most
heavily
armed
in
the
world
lay
face
to
face
and
scarcely
out
of
with
one
hundred
and
fifty
english
sloops
and
frigates
the
strongest
and
swiftest
that
the
island
could
furnish
and
commanded
by
men
whose
exploits
had
rung
through
the
world
farther
along
the
coast
invisible
but
known
to
be
performing
a
most
perilous
and
vital
service
was
a
squadron
of
dutch
vessels
of
all
sizes
lining
both
the
outer
and
inner
of
the
of
the
flemish
coasts
and
swarming
in
all
the
estuaries
and
inlets
of
that
intricate
and
dangerous
between
dunkirk
and
texel
those
fleets
of
holland
and
zealand
numbering
some
one
hundred
and
fifty
galleons
sloops
and
lay
patiently
blockading
every
possible
egress
from
the
ports
in
possession
of
the
duke
of
parma
and
longing
to
grapple
with
him
as
soon
as
his
fleet
of
gunboats
and
hoys
packed
with
his
spanish
and
italian
veterans
should
venture
to
set
forth
upon
the
sea
for
their
enterprise
this
friendly
attitude
of
the
dutch
to
the
english
was
due
to
a
variety
of
causes
both
nations
represented
the
new
religion
in
its
struggle
against
the
established
church
in
consequence
of
the
terrible
atrocities
of
the
duke
of
alva
the
dutch
had
an
inextinguishable
hatred
for
the
spaniards
and
were
ready
to
do
anything
to
thwart
their
plans
and
diminish
their
power
then
too
the
dutch
remembered
how
the
ships
of
elizabeth
laden
with
provisions
had
brought
succor
to
their
beleaguered
cities
and
saved
the
lives
of
their
famished
people
so
animated
by
enmity
on
the
one
side
and
by
gratitude
on
the
other
the
dutch
for
a
time
forgot
their
struggle
for
maritime
supremacy
with
the
english
and
brought
all
their
force
to
bear
to
support
the
english
cause
in
its
hour
of
greatest
need
the
spaniards
seem
never
to
have
anticipated
this
energetic
action
on
the
part
of
the
dutch
the
duke
of
medina
sidonia
now
found
that
he
could
get
no
direct
sea
communication
with
the
spanish
and
the
duke
of
parma
found
himself
in
a
situation
where
his
invincible
army
was
powerless
and
his
soldierly
experience
and
talents
were
of
no
avail
the
plans
of
the
spanish
admiral
to
make
use
of
the
small
vessels
of
parma
had
been
thwarted
by
the
dutch
and
the
dispersion
of
the
dutch
vessels
had
been
prevented
by
the
fierce
attack
of
howard
and
drake
upon
the
armada
in
coming
to
anchor
on
that
saturday
night
in
calais
harbor
however
the
spaniards
had
gained
two
important
points
their
ships
were
under
the
protection
of
friendly
and
nothing
remained
to
prevent
the
of
the
and
the
fleet
the
duke
of
parma
could
march
his
forces
westward
and
embark
from
calais
instead
of
dunkirk
and
thus
turn
the
flank
of
the
dutch
fleet
sunday
july
was
a
day
of
suspense
and
anxiety
on
the
part
of
both
the
contending
forces
the
english
knew
that
a
junction
with
parma
was
now
possible
and
howard
and
drake
were
too
good
seamen
not
to
know
that
in
a
close
and
general
engagement
the
superior
size
weight
and
numbers
of
the
spanish
ships
would
prevail
on
the
other
hand
the
spaniards
knew
that
they
were
in
an
unsafe
harbor
should
a
strong
wind
spring
up
from
the
west
and
medina
sidonia
began
to
have
a
wholesome
dread
of
the
valor
and
strength
which
guarded
the
homes
of
britain
the
day
passed
in
sabbath
quiet
and
repose
and
when
the
sun
set
there
was
no
indication
that
a
night
strife
was
to
follow
potential
as
shaping
the
future
destinies
of
both
spain
and
england
fright
and
flight
during
the
day
captain
winter
of
the
english
fleet
suggested
that
the
spaniards
might
be
driven
from
their
anchorage
by
and
his
plan
was
adopted
six
vessels
were
loaded
with
rosin
pitch
brimstone
and
other
combustibles
and
made
ready
to
sail
the
night
was
dark
with
indications
in
sky
and
sea
of
a
coming
gale
when
the
spanish
bells
says
froude
were
about
striking
twelve
and
save
the
watch
on
deck
soldiers
and
seamen
lay
stretched
in
sleep
certain
dark
objects
which
had
been
seen
dimly
drifting
in
the
tide
near
where
the
galleons
lay
thickest
shot
suddenly
into
pyramids
of
light
flames
leaping
from
ruddy
sail
to
sail
flickering
on
the
ropes
and
forecastles
masts
and
a
lurid
blaze
of
conflagration
a
cool
commander
might
have
ordered
out
his
boats
and
towed
the
clear
but
medina
sidonia
with
a
strain
already
upon
him
beyond
the
strength
of
his
capacity
saw
coming
some
terrible
engine
of
destruction
like
the
floating
mine
which
had
shattered
bridge
at
antwerp
panic
spread
through
the
entire
armada
hasty
and
impetuous
cries
arose
on
board
each
menaced
vessel
anchors
comrades
out
every
stitch
of
canvas
away
away
for
in
the
track
of
those
blazing
ships
follow
death
and
ruin
there
are
times
when
immense
bodies
of
men
suddenly
give
way
to
the
influence
of
a
needless
but
panic
and
this
was
one
of
them
every
cable
was
cut
galleon
galliasse
and
patache
drove
hurriedly
through
the
press
of
shipping
each
heedless
of
its
comrade
danger
and
seeking
frantically
some
channel
of
escape
in
vain
the
duke
of
medina
sidonia
attempted
to
reform
his
disordered
array
so
long
as
the
darkness
lasted
the
confusion
prevailed
and
ship
after
ship
reeled
staggered
and
drifted
out
to
sea
several
of
the
spanish
ships
were
disabled
two
were
burned
and
it
was
not
until
they
found
themselves
six
miles
from
shore
and
at
a
secure
distance
from
the
smoldering
hulks
that
they
recovered
from
their
terror
renewal
of
the
fight
on
monday
july
when
the
day
dawned
lord
howard
discovered
the
spanish
fleet
in
great
disorder
scattered
over
a
wide
space
in
the
channel
he
immediately
ordered
an
advance
and
while
drake
made
a
bold
attack
upon
the
main
body
of
the
enemy
the
lord
high
admiral
drove
upon
the
sands
several
of
the
sluggard
vessels
of
the
armada
which
the
had
failed
to
drive
out
to
sea
for
several
hours
he
engaged
the
great
galliasse
under
the
direct
command
of
admiral
moncada
which
was
aground
upon
the
sands
the
vessel
was
captured
and
moncada
slain
and
the
english
admiral
hastened
to
the
assistance
of
drake
it
was
well
says
froude
that
no
more
time
was
wasted
over
so
small
a
matter
lord
howard
had
already
delayed
too
long
for
his
fame
it
was
no
time
for
the
admiral
of
the
fleet
to
be
loitering
over
a
stray
feather
which
had
dropped
from
the
enemy
plume
when
every
ship
was
imperiously
needed
for
a
far
more
important
service
medina
sidonia
intended
to
return
to
calais
but
his
ships
had
drifted
in
the
night
far
to
the
east
and
before
his
signal
of
return
could
be
obeyed
the
english
fleet
was
upon
them
sir
henry
seymour
with
his
sixteen
ships
having
the
advantage
of
wind
speed
and
skill
came
upon
a
cluster
of
spanish
galleons
at
eight
in
the
morning
reserving
their
fire
till
within
a
hundred
and
twenty
yards
and
wasting
no
cartridges
the
english
ships
continued
through
the
entire
forenoon
to
pour
upon
them
one
continuous
rain
of
shot
they
were
driven
together
and
became
entangled
in
a
confused
and
helpless
mass
drake
in
the
mean
time
had
fallen
upon
a
score
of
galleons
under
the
direct
command
of
medina
sidonia
himself
they
were
better
handled
than
the
rest
and
were
endeavoring
to
keep
and
retain
some
command
of
themselves
but
their
wretched
sailing
powers
put
them
to
a
disadvantage
for
which
no
skill
or
courage
could
compensate
the
english
were
always
at
windward
of
them
and
hemmed
in
at
every
turn
they
too
were
forced
back
upon
their
consorts
hunted
together
as
a
shepherd
hunts
sheep
upon
a
common
and
the
whole
mass
of
them
were
forced
slowly
eastward
away
from
the
only
harbor
open
to
them
and
into
the
unknown
waters
of
the
north
sea
howard
came
up
at
noon
to
join
in
the
work
of
destruction
the
spaniards
always
bad
was
helpless
beyond
all
past
experience
from
eight
in
the
morning
until
sunset
the
english
almost
untouched
themselves
fired
into
them
without
intermission
at
short
range
they
ceased
only
when
the
last
cartridge
was
spent
and
every
man
was
weary
with
labor
they
took
no
prizes
and
they
attempted
to
take
none
their
orders
were
to
sink
and
destroy
they
saw
three
great
galleons
go
down
and
three
more
drift
toward
the
sands
where
their
destruction
was
certain
on
board
the
spanish
ships
all
was
consternation
and
despair
toward
sunset
the
great
santa
maria
went
down
with
all
on
board
when
the
ships
companies
were
called
over
it
was
discovered
that
no
less
than
four
thousand
men
had
been
killed
or
drowned
and
twice
as
many
wounded
the
survivors
were
so
utterly
dispirited
that
nothing
could
induce
them
to
face
england

upon

lord

with
his
squadron
was
to
return
to
guard
the
mouth
of
the
thames
against
any
attempt
on

while
the
remainder
of

was
to
continue
the
chase
of

ninety
vessels
under

the

so
fashioned
as
to

only
before

were
driven

made
its

through
her

in

the
spaniards
stricken
with
a
wonderful
fear
made
no

to
succor
their

pressed
heavily
on

them
to

continued
until
friday
august
there
was
now
no

to
be
apprehended
from
the
scattered

the

was
threatening
and
the

beginning
to
fail
howard
and
drake
determined
on
returning
homeward
leaving
a
couple
of
pinnaces
to
dog
the
spaniards
past
the
scottish
isles
though
the
wind
was
contrary
they
beat
back
against
it
without
loss
and
in
four
or
five
days
the

with

all
safely
arrived
in

buffeted
to

the
pope
but
the
king
and
under
him
the
clergy
held
their
offices
the
roman
catholic
ritual
was
not
as
in
some
of
the
european
sects
entirely
given
up
but
was
modified
to
suit
the
new
order
and
when
the
change
was
effected
the
new
ministers
firm
in
their
positions
the
new
ready
for
use
then
the
catholics
were
summarily
ordered
to
embrace
the
reformed
faith
at
that
time
it
had
not
dawned
upon
the
world
that
there
might
be
more
than
one
way
to
worship
god
in
truth
catholics
honestly
believed
that
protestants
were
going
straight
to
perdition
and
protestants
as
honestly
believed
that
a
like
fate
was
in
store
for
the
pope
and
his
followers
when
this
was
the
temper
of
conviction
the
natural
thing
for
each
church
to
do
was
to
persecute
every
other
not
from
hate
but
from
the
benevolent
determination
to
oblige
men
to
accept
the
true
religion
and
save
their
souls
even
though
it
might
be
necessary
in
the
course
of
proceedings
to
burn
their
bodies
mixed
with
this
legitimate
missionary
spirit
were
all
sorts
of
political
motives
the
church
whether
catholic
or
protestant
was
closely
connected
with
the
state
and
through
all
the
corruptions
of
party
politics
religion
had
to
be
dragged
so
when
the
english
state
established
protestantism
its
first
duty
and
interest
was
to
suppress
catholicism
after
two
protestant
kings
a
catholic
queen
came
to
the
throne
and
with
her
the
protestants
fell
and
the
catholics
rose
the
former
were
forbidden
their
service
their
ministers
were
turned
out
of
their
positions
fines
imprisonment
burning
punished
those
who
held
out
against
the
true
faith
again
the
scene
changed
the
queen
died
and
by
her
protestant
successor
freedom
of
worship
was
denied
to
catholics
and
the
anglican
church
was
as
the
church
of
england
meantime
in
the
church
of
england
a
spirit
of
criticism
had
grown
up
stricter
thinkers
disliked
the
imposing
ceremonies
which
the
english
church
still
retained
some
of
the
ministers
ceased
to
wear
gowns
in
preaching
performed
the
marriage
ceremony
without
using
a
ring
and
were
in
favor
of
simplifying
all
the
church
service
unpretentious
workers
began
to
tire
of
the
everlasting
quarreling
and
to
long
for
a
religion
simple
and
quiet
these
soon
met
trouble
for
the
rulers
had
decided
that
salvation
was
by
the
church
of
england
as
the
sovereign
its
head
should
order
dissent
was
the
guilt
of
heresy
and
revolution
sin
against
god
and
crime
against
the
king
and
english
law
they
were
forbidden
to
preach
at
all
if
they
would
not
wear
a
gown
during
service
and
the
people
who
went
to
hear
them
were
punished
this
treatment
caused
serious
thought
among
the
as
they
were
called
and
once
thinking
they
soon
concluded
that
the
king
had
no
such
supreme
right
to
order
the
church
and
the
church
had
over
its
ministers
no
such
right
of
absolute
dictation
various
sects
sprang
up
called
by
various
names
differing
among
themselves
upon
minor
points
but
agreeing
more
or
less
in
dissent
from
the
full
unquestioned
rule
and
service
of
the
episcopal
church
against
all
these
dissenters
the
laws
acted
as
against
the
catholics
not
only
must
englishmen
be
protestants
they
must
be
protestants
of
the
church
of
england
bodies
were
organized
to
keep
strict
watch
of
the
they
were
forbidden
their
simpler
church
worship
and
fined
if
they
did
not
attend
that
of
the
english
church
they
were
scoffed
and
scorned
by
the
profane
multitude
and
so
vexed
as
truly
their
affliction
was
not
small
john
robinson
congregation
among
that
division
of
the
called
puritans
was
a
little
congregation
at
scrooby
a
town
in
north
england
the
pastor
was
john
robinson
wise
kind
dignified
scholarly
and
his
helper
in
church
work
and
government
was
elder
william
brewster
a
college
man
who
had
served
at
the
royal
court
for
the
rest
the
congregation
were
mainly
farmers
who
wished
only
to
live
in
peace
according
to
bible
teaching
royal
servants
were
watchful
and
an
open
church
was
out
of
the
question
but
every
sunday
they
met
for
service
wherever
they
could
sometimes
in
elder
brewster
big
house
sometimes
anywhere
so
that
they
might
listen
to
their
beloved
pastor
during
the
week
they
worked
their
farms
thinking
and
talking
of
the
iniquities
of
the
catholics
the
impurities
of
the
episcopalians
the
hard
ways
that
beset
the
puritans
and
the
righteous
god
who
looked
down
upon
it
all
to
record
and
avenge
quiet
as
such
a
simple
church
in
a
corner
of
england
must
have
been
it
was
not
left
undisturbed
priests
of
the
dominant
church
and
officers
of
the
civil
service
soon
pounced
down
with
the
demand
that
the
puritan
farmers
stop
all
this
and
return
to
the
ways
of
the
loyal
church
john
robinson
people
however
had
no
notion
of
giving
up
their
they
possessed
a
full
share
of
english
obstinacy
and
backed
in
it
by
their
consciences
were
not
likely
to
surrender
at
once
so
their
troubles
began
they
were
hunted
and
persecuted
on
every
side
some
were
clapped
into
prisons
others
had
their
houses
beset
and
watched
night
and
day
and
hardly
escaped
their
hands
and
the
most
were
fain
to
fly
and
leave
their
houses
and
habitations
and
the
means
of
their
livelihood
what
shall
we
do
thought
the
distressed
farmers
we
can
not
live
in
such
persecution
we
will
have
to
go
away
give
up
indeed
no
we
shall
not
belie
our
consciences
for
any
man
since
god
is
behind
us
we
conform
and
under
opposition
and
injustice
puritan
lips
set
themselves
rigid
puritan
hearts
closed
against
the
persecutors
strong
reaction
from
the
beautiful
ceremonies
and
graceful
living
that
could
hide
such
unbrotherliness
became
almost
worship
of
unloveliness
and
hardship
in
after
years
the
lives
of
their
descendants
were
shaped
into
a
narrow
severity
not
drawn
from
the
sweetness
and
light
of
the
gospel
which
they
read
but
from
the
bitter
fountains
of
their
early
sufferings
and
wrongs
what
shall
we
do
cried
the
harassed
farmers
we
will
have
to
leave
our
home
and
go
to
holland
where
others
like
us
have
already
gone
and
where
we
hear
is
freedom
of
religion
for
all
men
yet
how
should
they
get
there
for
though
they
could
not
stay
yet
were
they
not
suffered
to
go
and
if
they
should
get
there
how
could
they
who
had
only
been
used
to
a
plain
country
life
and
the
innocent
trade
of
husbandry
manage
to
live
in
a
country
where
people
spoke
an
outlandish
language
instead
of
good
english
and
earned
their
money
by
trade
somehow
god
would
help
give
up
their
religion
they
would
not
they
set
about
going
they
bribed
ship
captains
feed
the
sailors
paid
unreasonable
rates
for
passage
and
then
deserted
by
these
same
captains
and
sailors
tried
it
again
with
others
were
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
officers
who
rifled
them
of
what
money
they
had
left
and
turned
them
over
to
prison
hard
luck
set
free
from
prison
they
bargained
with
a
dutchman
to
take
them
in
his
ship
to
holland
but
as
they
were
going
aboard
a
company
of
armed
men
surprised
them
and
the
dutchman
afraid
to
be
seen
in
such
company
hastily
sailed
away
with
half
the
pilgrims
leaving
the
rest
terrified
on
the
shore
take
us
back
cried
the
men
do
you
see
our
wives
and
children
crying
after
us
but
the
dutchman
was
afraid
of
the
soldiers
what
will
they
do
without
us
cried
the
men
straining
their
eyes
to
see
all
that
was
happening
on
shore
our
goods
are
not
yet
aboard
take
us
back
no
use
the
dutchman
sailed
away
and
the
soldiers
carried
off
the
frightened
women
and
children
to
prison
when
the
authorities
had
them
safely
locked
up
they
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
silly
women
and
helpless
children
who
cried
for
their
husbands
and
fathers
and
when
asked
concerning
their
homes
cried
the
more
and
declared
they
had
any
and
after
making
themselves
sufficient
trouble
they
solved
the
important
problem
by
letting
the
ridiculous
creatures
go
again
the
dutchman
ship
through
a
terrible
storm
came
to
land
the
distressed
husbands
sought
the
distressed
wives
and
troublous
wanderings
ended
in
reunion
so
were
they
continually
thwarted
but
by
one
means
or
another
determined
wills
bent
circumstances
to
their
end
and
at
last
they
reached
holland
strangers
as
they
were
destitute
all
unused
to
the
new
life
and
people
they
had
trouble
enough
at
first
but
they
wasted
little
time
staring
at
the
new
world
it
was
a
world
they
were
to
become
a
part
of
as
soon
as
possible
and
with
characteristic
earnestness
they
fell
to
work
at
any
thing
they
found
to
do
after
a
year
in
amsterdam
they
settled
in
leyden
they
made
them
homes
they
learned
as
best
they
could
the
uncouth
language
they
taught
their
farmer
hands
unaccustomed
crafts
and
applied
their
farmer
heads
to
the
mysteries
of
trade
elder
brewster
with
the
tastes
and
habits
of
a
gentleman
a
rapidly
diminishing
property
and
a
large
family
of
children
looked
about
for
work
and
presently
obtained
pupils
whom
he
taught
english
after
an
original
method
later
he
set
up
a
and
in
printing
puritan
books
forbidden
to
be
published
in
england
found
plenty
to
do
robinson
visited
his
people
and
was
busy
for
their
welfare
preached
studied
wrote
books
he
was
a
kind
friend
and
helper
and
a
scholar
besides
and
proud
of
him
were
his
devoted
flock
leyden
dutchmen
looked
with
curiosity
upon
the
knot
of
plain
foreigners
sober
men
quiet
women
children
named
after
all
the
bible
saints
and
heavenly
virtues
bibles
they
brought
and
evidently
read
it
was
rumored
that
together
every
morning
and
before
each
meal
each
household
held
service
of
prayer
and
long
sermons
and
various
devotions
wholly
filled
the
sabbath
queer
people
meditated
the
hollanders
but
they
soon
found
that
it
was
safe
to
trust
the
bible
readers
though
they
were
peculiar
about
sunday
they
were
surprisingly
certain
to
keep
their
promises
and
for
all
their
propensity
to
pray
without
ceasing
they
made
most
faithful
workmen
superintendents
sought
them
for
laborers
merchants
willingly
gave
them
credit
and
with
the
passing
years
they
became
settled
and
quietly
prosperous
the
bibles
were
not
neglected
the
daily
prayers
and
weekly
sermons
were
methodically
attended
the
unpretentious
people
were
not
unobserved
many
from
england
came
to
enjoy
like
freedom
of
worship
and
far
outside
of
leyden
john
robinson
learning
was
known
when
arminians
and
calvinists
fell
into
hot
disputes
and
leyden
ministers
and
university
professors
held
public
meetings
twice
a
week
to
settle
knotty
points
of
doctrine
john
robinson
was
always
there
listening
eagerly
to
both
sides
many
a
famous
talk
he
bad
with
the
ministers
and
professors
we
must
have
robinson
confute
the
arminians
cried
his
friends
among
themselves
so
on
a
day
the
puritan
pastor
somewhat
demurring
because
he
was
a
foreigner
yet
withal
not
loath
to
ride
a
tilt
with
the
enemy
confronted
episcopus
the
arminian
professor
and
it
is
reported
by
the
calvinists
that
his
overwhelming
arguments
utterly
nonplussed
and
put
the
great
episcopus
to
rout
oh
those
theological
debates
about
the
paltry
affairs
of
this
world
it
was
not
right
to
quarrel
when
personal
considerations
were
at
stake
puritan
worthies
could
bridle
the
tongue
but
when
was
called
in
question
some
keenly
felt
phase
of
the
truth
some
doctrine
their
precious
bible
seemed
to
teach
then
the
repressed
fire
burst
into
legitimate
flame
and
righteous
indignation
with
magnificent
effect
hurled
back
and
forth
the
thunderbolts
of
prophecy
and
psalm
the
departure
from
leyden
after
some
eleven
or
twelve
years
of
this
life
in
leyden
the
puritans
began
to
grow
restless
holland
was
not
home
to
them
and
they
were
lonely
some
of
them
were
growing
old
and
the
somber
burden
of
poverty
and
exile
began
to
weary
the
brave
shoulders
the
children
were
growing
up
and
hard
work
and
cramped
life
pressed
all
too
severely
upon
the
young
natures
so
that
they
either
threw
off
the
yoke
and
turned
to
bad
ways
or
bearing
it
patiently
missed
the
chance
of
education
and
grew
old
before
their
time
they
feared
to
stay
longer
in
this
foreign
country
lest
the
children
should
learn
from
the
dutch
to
break
the
sabbath
should
lose
their
native
language
should
cease
to
be
englishmen
perhaps
it
would
be
best
to
move
again
and
settle
in
some
land
under
the
flag
of
dear
england
harsh
england
that
would
not
grant
them
peace
at
home
though
they
should
have
to
go
to
most
distant
regions
they
would
cheerfully
go
and
consider
themselves
missionaries
there
if
only
they
might
have
the
protection
of
england
king
they
would
go
and
break
the
way
for
others
of
their
countrymen
less
strong
and
in
america
if
need
be
prepare
an
english
home
for
englishmen
gravely
the
elders
talked
together
the
uncongenial
life
had
been
cheerfully
borne
a
new
uprooting
and
uncertain
change
would
be
as
steadfastly
carried
through
once
they
were
sure
god
willed
it
and
at
last
it
seemed
best
to
decide
upon
removal
the
dangers
were
great
but
not
desperate
the
difficulties
were
many
but
not
invincible
and
all
of
them
through
the
help
of
god
by
fortitude
and
patience
might
either
be
borne
or
overcome
sturdy
courage
o
england
to
exile
such
sons
where
then
should
they
go
i
will
guide
thee
reads
the
promise
of
the
puritan
bible
and
to
god
they
turn
in
prayer
for
direction
a
general
meeting
is
held
and
much
discussion
results
in
the
decision
to
cross
the
atlantic
to
virginia
great
britain
vast
new
realm
they
would
not
settle
near
the
colony
already
planted
there
for
that
was
of
the
episcopal
church
and
might
molest
them
but
away
by
themselves
somewhere
anywhere
if
only
they
might
nestle
in
a
remote
corner
of
their
king
dominions
and
on
english
soil
be
free
to
follow
their
own
conscience
god
and
the
king
was
the
loyal
thought
yet
if
there
be
choice
the
king
shall
not
be
first
but
sending
petition
to
the
king
they
found
that
he
would
give
them
no
assurance
of
freedom
of
worship
it
was
intimated
that
if
they
did
go
the
royal
eye
might
be
expected
to
wink
at
the
proceeding
but
as
for
promises
royalty
would
not
commit
itself
here
was
a
discouragement
how
should
they
dare
break
up
their
homes
and
cross
the
ocean
to
an
unknown
uncolonized
land
with
no
assurance
of
protection
and
liberty
when
they
arrived
there
but
the
leaders
rallied
again
if
on
the
king
part
there
is
a
purpose
or
desire
to
wrong
us
they
cried
though
we
had
a
seal
as
broad
as
the
it
would
not
serve
the
turn
for
there
would
be
means
enough
found
to
recall
or
reverse
we
must
rest
herein
on
god
providence
as
we
have
done
before
not
lacking
in
comprehension
of
the
world
ways
and
in
canny
shrewdness
were
those
puritans
wearisome
negotiations
then
began
with
men
who
should
furnish
means
for
the
removal
back
and
forth
from

from

into
the
harrowed

months
of
all
this
the

were

a
body
of
london
merchants
agreed
to
furnish
ships
and
provisions
for
the
passage
on
certain
conditions
for
seven
years
after
landing
the
puritans
were
to
hold
all
property
in
common
they
were
to
fish
plant
build
and
at
the
end
of
seven
years
were
to
share
with
the
merchants
according
to
certain
specified
conditions
the
accumulated
property
capital
and
profits
hard
terms
but
they
could
not
choose
and
go
they
must
who
should
go
this
question
agitated
the
leyden
congregation
not

voyage
perhaps
not

so
far
so
far
yet
the
most
were
willing
and
it
remained
to
select
from
the
large
congregation
those
most
fit
for
the
hard
task
there
was
dividing
of
friend
from
friend
of
husband
from
wife
of
father
from
child
elder
brewster
would
go
as
their
spiritual
leader
since
the
beloved
pastor
must
for
the
present
stay
with
those
who
remained
hoping
later
to
cross
the
sea
and
come
to
them
a
ship
the
speedwell
was
fitted
up
in
holland
another
the
mayflower
awaited
them
in
england
when
all
was
ready
they
appointed
a
day
of
solemn
fasting
and
prayer
pastor
robinson
preached
to
them
a
good
part
of
the
day
on
the
text
and
there
at
the
river
by
ahava
i
proclaimed
a
fast
that
we
might
humble
ourselves
before
our
god
and
seek
of
him
a
right
way
for
us
and
for
our
children
and
for
all
our
substance
and
the
rest
of
the
time
was
spent
in
pouring
out
prayers
to
the
lord
with
great
fervency
mixed
with
abundance
of
again
they
met
together
in
a
feast
at
the
pastor
house
sorry
feasting
the
hospitality
was
large
but
hearts
were
too
full
for
much
but
tears
a
tender
painful
farewell
gathering
their
pastor
going
about
among
them
with
words
of
comfort
and
counsel
gentle
last
suggestions
scripture
texts
believed
though
the
voice
that
repeats
them
trembles
and
breaks
believed
and
clung
to
through
the
tug
of
parting
fear
thou
not
for
i
am
with
thee
be
not
dismayed
for
i
am
thy
god
i
will
strengthen
thee
yea
i
will
help
thee
yea
i
will
uphold
thee
with
the
right
hand
of
my
righteousness
god
is
our
refuge
and
strength
a
very
present
help
in
trouble
therefore
will
not
we
fear
though
the
earth
be
removed
and
though
the
mountains
be
carried
into
the
midst
of
the
sea
the
lord
of
hosts
is
with
us
the
god
of
jacob
is
our
refuge
yes
they
believed
and
believing
they
sang
through
tears
quivering
pain
notes
at
first
then
faith
dominating
the
tones
grew
firmer
and
sustained
until
the
final
words
rang
out
clear
and
strong
and
with
the
end
of
the
hymn
they
were
ready
for
last
earnest
and
quiet
to
take
ship
they
went
to
delft
haven
fourteen
miles
from
leyden
and
to
the
port
pastor
robinson
with
most
of
their
friends
accompanied
them
one
more
night
on
land
then
the
long
voyage
and
the
uncertain
future
there
was
little
sleep
that
night
and
again
with
bible
words
and
christian
counsel
hearts
were
strengthened
in
the
morning
the
wind
being
fair
they
went
aboard
and
their
friends
with
them
where
truly
doleful
was
the
sight
of
that
sad
and
mournful
parting
to
see
what
sighs
and
sobs
and
prayers
did
sound
among
them
we
know
we
know
god
our
refuge
but
sore
is
the
parting
we
willing
but
our
hearts
are
wrung
there
is
no
thought
of
regret
or
turning
but
oh
the
pain
of
it
the
dutchmen
loitering
in
the
sunshine
on
the
shore
watching
with
heavy
curiosity
this
strange
departure
suddenly
find
their
own
eyes
filled
with
sympathetic
tears
we
must
be
off
cries
the
captain
half
impatient
over
so
much
fervency
and
tears
they
kneel
around
the
pastor
and
with
unsteady
voice
though
his
trust
is
firm
he
calls
upon
the
god
in
whom
they
believe
to
guide
and
bless
these
his
children
once
more
the
arms
cling
close
mother
mother
how
can
i
let
you
go
my
child
my
child
beloved
you
will
come
over
to
me
soon
oh
my
husband
god
wills
it
i
must
go
my
son
i
shall
not
live
to
see
your
face
again
loosen
the
clasping
arms
unfold
the
clinging
fingers
you
stay
and
we
go
and
the
ocean
lies
between
the
wind
comes
breathing
the
sails
fill
across
the
widening
space
and
they
are
gone
the
voyage
they
sailed
first
to
meet
the
mayflower
and
others
of
the
puritan
company
at
southampton
england
there
they
called
robert
cushman
to
account
fell
out
with
one
of
their
london
patrons
read
together
an
affectionate
farewell
letter
from
robinson
made
all
final
arrangements
for
the
voyage
and
on
august
set
sail
in
the
two
ships
for
america
but
the
captain
of
the
speedwell
in
the
business
twice
had
them
back
to
land
to
repair
pretended
leaks
and
the
second
time
putting
in
at
plymouth
it
was
determined
to
leave
the
speedwell
and
a
part
of
the
puritan
band
the
little
company
small
enough
before
was
again
reduced
like
gideon
some
were
discouraged
with
the
many
hindrances
and
willingly
stayed
some
were
beginning
to
fear
for
the
success
of
the
voyage
undertaken
so
late
in
the
season
some
were
weak
and
could
be
spared
where
there
was
need
of
the
strongest
some
little
children
were
sent
back
to
await
a
later
passage
robert
cushman
vexed
to
the
soul
by
the
unsatisfactoriness
of
his
negotiations
sick
and
disheartened
stayed
behind
again
there
were
sad
parting
tears
and
prayers
but
god
would
sustain
and

over
the
wide
ocean
in
search
of
an
english
home
where
englishmen
might
freely
worship
god
the
voyage
at
first
was
fair
enough
they
were
seasick
some
of
them
the
children
had
to
be
watched
lest
they
fall
overboard
a
profane
bully
of
a
sailor
after
using
all
manner
of
abuse
toward
the
sick
ones
himself
fell
ill
and
died
and
says
william
bradford
recording
it
thus
his
curses
light
on
his
own
head
and
it
was
an
astonishment
to
all
his
fellows
for
they
noted
it
to
be
the
just
hand
of
god
upon
him
later
came
storms
and
danger
with
breaking
of
masts
eager
consultation
among
the
ship
officers
water
wind
confusion
but
the
masts
were
mended
and
they
committed
themselves
to
the
will
of
god
and
resolved
to
proceed
big
john
howland
coming
on
deck
was
thrown
into
the
sea
by
a
lurch
of
the
ship
but
with
a
rope
was
hauled
in
again
and
saved
before
they
came
to
land
a
little
boy
was
born
in
the
hopkins
family
and
they
named
him
oceanus
and
samuel
fuller
servant
a
young
man
named
william
butten
died
as
they
neared
the
coast
the
hard
voyage
was
over
at
last
and
on
the
of
november
cape
cod
appeared
they
knew
about
cape
cod
from
the
map
and
book
of
captain
john
smith
who
had
tried
to
plant
a
colony
there
some
years
before
but
they
intended
to
land
somewhere
near
the
hudson
river
and
turned
south
along
the
coast
shoals
and
breakers
barring
their
passage
that
way
they
returned
and
on
november
anchored
in
cape
cod
harbor
being
now
passed
the
vast
ocean
and
a
sea
of
troubles
before
their
preparation
unto
further
proceedings
they
fell
down
upon
their
knees
and
blessed
the
lord
the
god
of
heaven
who
had
brought
them
over
the
vast
and
furious
ocean
and
delivered
them
from
all
perils
and
miseries
thereof
again
to
set
their
feet
on
the
firm
and
stable
earth
their
proper
element
so
there
they
were
and
as
yet
no
one
had
left
the
ship
it
was
winter
the
cold
blue
ocean
beat
the
cold
white
shore
and
the
dark
forest
further
back
rustled
and
moaned
in
the
north
wind
whistling
bleak
welcome
what
could
those
women
and
children
do
there
west
from
the
sea
lay
an
unexplored
country
no
one
knew
how
large
dark
forest
uninhabited
save
for
the
dusky
indian
clothed
the
land
in
an
unbroken
mystery
of
wilderness
north
and
south
stretched
the
desolate
coast
stretched
five
hundred
miles
ere
it
reached
the
nearest
european
settlement
east
lay
the
ocean
not
to
be
recrossed
how
could
the
men
build
shelter
in
the
midst
of
a
northern
winter
and
they
must
build
for
the
ship
store
of
provisions
was
none
too
large
and
the
captain
impatient
to
be
off
again
before
famine
set
in
after
ages
of
comfort
shiver
to
think
of
it
that
lone
cold
landing
the
stretching
desolate
coast
the
cutting
snow
the
little
anchored
ship
bearing
treasure
of
warm
human
hearts
strong
human
wills
clear
purpose
courage
untamed
slight
protection
the
rocking
ship
for
such
precious
store
of
life
with
that
white
relentless
winter
coming
down
upon
the
bay
the
day
of
casting
anchor
those
steadfast
earnest
men
whose
god
was
the
lord
and
whose
king
was
james
of
england
gathered
in
the
mayflower
cabin
and
by
a
formal
statement
written
and
signed
formed
themselves
into
a
civil
state
note
the
words
of
the
compact
in
the
name
of
god
amen
we
whose
names
are
underwritten
the
loyal
subjects
of
our
dread
sovereign
lord
king
james
have
fled
over
seas
from
english
persecution

undertaken
for
the
glory
of

and
the
advancement
of
the
christian
faith
and
honor
of
our
king
and
country
a
voyage
to
plant
the
first
colony
in
the
northern
parts
of
virginia
god
and
the
king
true
christians
and
true
englishmen
the
document
reads
with
a
calm
dignity
a
clear
political
instinct
a
solemn
religious
faith
worthy
of
englishmen
they
may
have
braved
english
laws
for
conscience
sake
but
there
is
no
bravado
they
may
keenly
feel
the
injustice
they
have
experienced
but
there
was
no
repining
then
began
expeditions
to
the
land
the
men
under
captain
standish
went
in
parties
in
a
small
boat
returning
to
the
ship
at
night
or
in
some
cases
they
camped
on
the
shore
and
were
away
from
the
ship
several
days
wading
to
the
shore
through
water
too
shallow
even
for
the
small
boat
with
freezing
as
it
covered
them
tramping
through
the
snow
breaking
through
the
forest
with
prayer
each
morning
and
always
a
day
of
rest
on
sunday
they
explored
the
coast
and
wilderness
for
the
best
place
to
settle
they
found
yellow
indian
corn
buried
by
the
indians
in
and
carried
it
to
the
ship
counting
it
god
special
providence
that
they
were
thus
provided
with
seed
to
plant
the
next
year
the
lord
is
never
wanting
unto
his
in
their
greatest
needs
let
his
holy
name
have
all
the
praise
cried
william
bradford
november
wore
away
dark
and
wild
and
with
set
teeth
december
came
back
and
forth
went
the
exploring
parties
a
skirmish
with
the
indians
took
place
but
it
pleased
god
to
vanquish
their
enemies
and
give
them
deliverance
and
by
his
special
providence
so
to
dispose
that
not
any
one
of
them
was
hurt
or
hit
though
their
arrows
came
close
thereupon
they
gave
the
lord
solemn
thanks
and
named
the
place
the
first
encounter
after
a
stormy
dangerous
week
saturday
december
dawned
clear
and
the
sun
shone
down
on
the
snowy
world
the
sabbath
day
the
explorers
observed
on
shore
and
monday
they
sounded
the
harbor
and
found
it
fit
for
shipping
and
marched
into
the
land
and
found
a
place
fit
for
situation
at
least
it
was
the
best
they
could
find
and
the
season
and
their
present
necessity
made
them
glad
to
accept
of
it
so
they
returned
to
their
ship
again
with
this
news
to
the
rest
of
their
people
which
did
much
comfort
their
hearts
this
day
december
old
style
corresponding
to
december
new
style
is
celebrated
as
the
date
of
the
landing
of
the
pilgrims
meantime
what
of
those
left
in
the
ship
these
four
dreary
weeks
the
ways
of
life
went
on
in
births
and
deaths
six
of
the
wanderers
found
the
door
of
the
other

and
peregrine
white
came
into
this
of

the
little
boy
jasper
more
who
came
in

of
the
carvers
died
and
dorothy
bradford
fell
overboard
and
was
drowned
while
her
husband
was
exploring
the
coast
the
men
had
terrible
coughs
and
colds
from
wading
through
the
freezing
sea
and
the
women
were
beginning
to
suffer
from
the
hardship
of
it
all
the
children
adapted
themselves
to
the
situation
billington
being
gone
to
the
shore
his
son
john
with
the
family
gun
well
loaded
took
occasion
to
try
his
skill
by
shooting
it
off
in
the
cabin
yet
by
god
mercy
no
harm
was
done
midwinter
and

in
with
more
severity

for

tiny
babies
to
be
shielded
from
all
harm
their
only
home
the
inhospitable
shore
no
time
to
lose
the
they
began
to
build
the
first
house
and
so
was
planted
plymouth
in
that
dead
winter
time
sprang
plymouth
cold
for
the
seed
of
the
mayflower
but
mayflower
seed
did
not
easily
die
the
houses
went
up
one
after
another
and
as
it
became
possible
the
company
on
the
ship
were
transferred
to
the
land
the
ship
indeed
became
more
and
more
undesirable
sickness
prevailed
the
sailors
did
not
escape
but
dragged
about
or
tossed
in
their
beds
in
fierce
impatience
and
of
the
puritans
half
their

english
since
there
are
few
well
enough
to
build
the
little
settlement
snowbound
between
the
ocean
and
the

but
slowly
sometimes
death
comes
twice
and
thrice
in
a
day
and
the
whole
scene
is
a
funeral
and
the
ocean
one

it

they
gather
at

to

the

of
her
and
send

back

back
goes
the

straight
to

yet
with
that
fearful

freezing
in

scarce
fifty
of

left

not

the

disappears
on

chapter
ix
and
how
an
empire
was
india
the
great
peninsula
stretching
from
the
himalayas
to
cape
comorin
is
nearly
half
as
large
as
europe
and
contains
a
population
of
myth
and
tradition
claim
for
this
people
a
very
great
antiquity
and
there
are
many
evidences
that
in
arts
government
and
literature
india
is
at
least
coeval
with
china
and
egypt
the
three
constituting
the
most
ancient
civilizations
of
the
world
while
western
europe
was
still
the
abode
of
barbarians
and
while
even
greece
had
scarcely
felt
the
impulse
which
aroused
her
to
intellectual
life
the
fabrics
of
india
had
reached
a
marvelous
degree
of
fineness
and
beauty
and
the
monarchs
of
the
west
counted
it
a
great
privilege
to
be
clothed
in
the
purple
and
fine
linen
of
the
orient
early
history
the
early
history
of
india
seems
a
confused
tangle
of
strifes
and
contentions
between
different
nations
and
races
for
the
possession
of
this
region
inexpressibly
rich
in
all
that
makes
a
land
desirable
for
the
occupation
of
man
and
of
wars
between
local
rulers
striving
for
dominion
in
the
midst
of
this
confusion
however
there
seems
to
be
good
evidence
that
the
early
civilization
made
its
first
appearance
in
the
valleys
of
the
upper
indus
that
all
invasions
until
recent
times
were
from
the
fierce
tribes
of
the
to
the
northwest
that
the
industrious
people
of
the
valleys
were
driven
from
their
homes
by
successive
incursions
of
barbarians
extending
through
many
centuries
that
each
horde
becoming
partially
civilized
was
in
turn
driven
forward
and
that
the
migrations
were
continuous
from
the
north
to
the
south
thus
it
happens
that
at
present
the
population
of
india
consists
of
at
least
thirty
distinct
nationalities
and
that
the
aboriginal
possessors
of
the
vale
of
cashmere
have
been
driven
forward
until
now
they
are
found
only
upon
the
summits
of
the
neilgherry
mountains
in
the
extreme
southern
part
of
the
peninsula
the
mogul
empire
the
brahminical
religion
has
prevailed
in
india
from
the
earliest
period
the
first
literary
productions
of
the
people
are
the
vedas
the
sacred
books
of
the
brahmins
this
religion
is
tolerant
and
inclusive
its
pantheon
recognizes
so
many
gods
that
each
barbarous
tribe
from
the
north
found
their
own
deity
represented
so
that
their
crude
religious
notions
readily
merged
in
the
more
complicated
system
of
the
people
they
had
conquered
the
great
buddhistic
reform
spent
its
force
and
although
triumphant
in
other
lands
it
left
but
little
impress
in
india
where
it
originated
the
whole
people
believed
the
brahminical
creed
and
practiced
the
brahminical
precepts
it
was
a
religion
that
included
the
purest
abstractions
and
the
grossest
form
of
idolatry
while
absorbing
all
other
creeds
it
never
sought
to
make
converts
to
its
own
the
later
incursions
from
the
northwest
were
essentially
different
from
their
predecessors
the
tribes
of
the
had
been
converted
to
the
fanatical
and
proselyting
faith
of
mohammed
about
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
a
mongol
tribe
strong
and
stalwart
from
late
successful
wars
and
full
of
the
fierce
zeal
of
recent
converts
to
moslemism
appeared
at
the
northern
gate
of
india
and
in
a
short
time
overspread
the
country
and
established
the
mogul
empire
with
its
capital
at
delhi
the
stern
conquerors
never
rested
until
they
had
firmly
established
their
authority
over
the
whole
country
the
first
great
sultan
baber
had
a
genius
for
government
he
was
firm
and
temperate
in
his
administration
and
he
protected
the
common
people
from
the
worst
rapacity
of
their
former
rulers
out
of
the
chaos
of
native
rule
he
evoked
something
like
civilized
order
and
he
established
the
mogul
empire
upon
the
foundation
of
a
higher
form
of
justice
than
had
ever
before
been
practiced
in
the
east
after
a
reign
of
fifty
years
this
great
monarch
died
in
two
years
before
the
adventurous
john
smith
set
foot
upon
the
territory
of
virginia
for
another
hundred
years
the
mogul
emperors
descendants
of
baber
held
firm
possession
of
india
and
in
that
time
the
country
reached
the
height
of
its
power
in
wealth
and
influence
temples
and
palaces
in
richness
and
beauty
surpassing
the
most
gorgeous
dreams
of
people
arose
on
every
side
arts
flourished
as
never
before
and
the
commerce
of
india
overland
to
the
west
was
so
great
that
large
cities
sprung
up
along
its
track
solely
supported
by
the
trading
caravans
the
gold
from
all
the
nations
toward
the
setting
sun
was
drained
to
pay
for
indian
fabrics
and
india
became
the
richest
country
of
the
world
in
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
mogul
empire
began
to
decline
weak
and
effeminate

occupied
the

of
baber
and
shah
jehan
the
governors
of
great
provinces
while
ruling
under

really
independent
and
in
turn
revolted
and
set
up
an
independent

the
whole

was
ablaze
with
civil
war
rapacious
chieftains
plundered
the

the

declined
industry
of
all
kinds
languished
and
the
country
upon
which
nature
had
lavished
her

seemed
to
be
surrendered
hopelessly
to
oppression
and
misrule
european
settlements
in
india
during
the
last
century
of
the
mogul
rule
and
the
following
half
century
of
anarchy
a
new
element
entered
into
the
affairs
of
india
which
was
destined
to
effect
great
and
revolutionary
changes
following
the
wake
of
vasco
da
gama
the
maritime
powers
of
western
europe
all
entered
into
a
trade
with
india
by
the
way
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
the
long
caravan
route
through
central
asia
was
abandoned
and
ships
of
the
sea
took
the
place
of
ships
of
the
desert
lisbon
amsterdam
and
london
absorbed
the
trade
which
had
made
bagdad
aleppo
and
bassorah
opulent
and
these
renowned
cities
of
haroun
speedily
declined
in
wealth
power
and
influence
the
portuguese
dutch
french
and
english
entered
into
eager
competition
to
secure
the
trade
of
india
by
the
new
route
and
to
facilitate
commercial
operations
stations
called
factories
were
established
along
the
coast
by
the
consent
of
the
native
princes
these
factories
and
a
small
territory
adjacent
were
under
the
exclusive
civil
control
of
the
people
occupying
them
illustration
scene
in
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
these
factories
remained
mere
trading
stations
taking
no
part
in
the
general
political
affairs
of
the
country
while
trade
was
active
and
the
profits
great
the
east
india
companies
who
controlled
the
factories
were
content
and
while
the
annual
tribute
or
rent
was
paid
with
regularity
the
native
princes
had
a
strong
motive
for
protecting
the
trading
companies
in
their
operations
but
the
display
of
barbaric
splendor
excited
the
cupidity
of
many
of
the
agents
of
the
companies
and
the
atrocities
of
barbaric
tyranny
aroused
the
indignation
of
others
and
there
came
a
time
when
interference
in
native
affairs
seemed
both
natural
and
proper
the
time
of
the
new
departure
in
policy
was
about
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
place
the
southeast
coast
and
the
occasion
the
civil
wars
which
grew
out
of
disputed
succession
the
student
of
history
finds
it
difficult
to
understand
fully
the
political
situation
at
the
time
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
all
the
provinces
of
the
mogul
empire
was
the
deccan
which
extended
its
sway
over
all
of
southern
india
the
ruler
known
as
the
nizam
administered
the
government
in
the
name
of
the
mogul
but
in
reality
he
was
independent
and
a
true
eastern
despot
the
chief
province
of
the
deccan
was
the
carnatic
which
embraced
all
the
territory
along
the
eastern
coast
the
sovereign
of
this
region
called
the
nabob
while
paying
a
nominal
tribute
to
the
nizam
was
really
independent
raising
revenue
waging
wars
and
forming
alliances
without
reference
to
either
the
government
of
the
deccan
or
that
of
the
mogul
empire
to
add
to
the
general
confusion
bands
of
mahrattas
in
numbers
forming
large
armies
were
constantly
roaming
through
the
country
and
levying
contributions
on
both
the
governments
and
the
people
this
peculiar
race
was
at
first
a
mere
band
of
robbers
which
descended
from
the
western
mountains
of
india
but
by
repeated
conquests
and
by
accessions
from
the
wild
and
turbulent
classes
of
all
parts
of
the
country
they
bad
become
a
great
power
and
ruled
in
many
fertile
provinces
in
becoming
sovereigns
they
did
not
cease
to
be
freebooters
every
region
which
was
not
subject
to
their
rule
was
wasted
by
their
incursions
whenever
their
were
heard
the
peasant
threw
his
bag
of
rice
on
his
shoulder
hid
his
small
savings
in
his
girdle
and
fled
with
his
wife
and
children
to
the
mountains
or
the
jungles
to
the
milder
neighborhood
of
the
hyena
and
the
tiger
dupleix
and
french
policy
at
this
time
the
two
principal
factories
on
the
east
coast
of
india
were
the
british
station
at
fort
george
now
madras
and
the
french
station
at
pondicherry
eighty
miles
farther
south
the
first
man
who
seems
to
have
entertained
definite
notions
about
building
up
a
european
sovereignty
upon
the
ruins
of
the
mogul
empire
was
dupleix
the
french
governor
at
pondicherry
his
long
residence
in
the
east
had
given
him
a
knowledge
of
indian
affairs
that
few
europeans
possessed
his
restless
capacious
and
inventive
mind
says
macaulay
had
formed
this
scheme
at
a
time
when
the
oldest
servants
of
the
english
company
were
busied
only
about
invoices
and
bills
of
lading
nor
had
he
only
proposed
for
himself
the
end
he
had
also
a
just
and
distinct
view
of
the
means
by
which
it
was
to
be
attained
he
clearly
saw
that
the
greatest
force
which
the
princes
of
india
could
bring
into
the
field
would
be
no
match
for
the
small
body
of
men
trained
in
the
discipline
and
guided
by
the
tactics
of
the
west
he
saw
also
that
the
natives
of
india
might
under
european
commanders
be
formed
into
armies
such
as
saxe
or
frederick
would
be
proud
to
command
he
was
perfectly
aware
that
the
most
easy
and
convenient
way
in
which
a
european
adventurer
could
exercise
sovereignty
in
india
was
to
govern
the
motions
and
speak
through
the
mouth
of
some
glittering
puppet
dignified
by
the
title
of
nabob
or
nizam
the
arts
both
of
war
and
policy
which
a
few
years
later
were
employed
with
such
signal
success
by
the
english
were
first
understood
and
practiced
by
this
ingenious
and
aspiring
frenchman
in
the
nizam
of
the
deccan
died
two
claimants
for
the
throne
appeared
in
the
persons
of
nazir
jung
son
of
the
old
nizam
and
mirzapha
jung
a
grandson
about
the
same
time
an
adventurer
chunda
sahib
set
up
a
claim
for
the
throne
of
the
carnatic
against
anaverdy
khan
the
reigning
prince
here
was
the
opportunity
for
dupleix
to
carry
his
plans
into
execution
he
espoused
the
cause
of
chunda
sahib
in
the
carnatic
and
sent
four
hundred
french
soldiers
to
his
assistance
a
battle
was
fought
and
anaverdy
khan
was
killed
his
son
mohammed
ali
fled
with
a
scanty
remnant
of
his
army
to
trichinopoly
and
nearly
all
the
carnatic
submitted
to
the
conqueror
next
dupleix
lent
his
french
soldiers
to
mirzapha
jung
who
in
a
short
time
became
master
of
the
deccan
the
new
sovereigns
showered
wealth
and
favors
upon
the
successful
frenchman
he
was
declared
governor
of
a
territory
in
india
as
large
as
all
france
with
a
population
of
people
he
was
placed
in
command
of
the
largest
military
force
of
the
country
he
was
presented
with
a
million
dollars
in
money
and
many
valuable
jewels

nabob
concluded
any
affairs
of
moment
without
his
advice
and
consent
he
was
in
fact
invested
with
sovereign
powers
and
french
influence
in
southern
india
was
paramount
and
seemingly
firmly
established
the
triumph
of
the
french
arms
carried
consternation
to
the
british
factory
at
george
unless
the
victorious
career
of
dupleix
could
be
stayed
not
only
would
british
influence
be
destroyed
but
the
very
existence
of
their
trading
posts
would
soon
be
at
an
end
at
this
time
the
government
of
george
was
feeble
the
military
officers
in
command
were
without
experience
everything
betokened
speedy
and
irretrievable
ruin
in
this
emergency
the
valor
and
genius
of
an
obscure
english
youth
suddenly
turned
the
tide
of
fortune
robert
clive
and
the
siege
of
arcot
robert
clive
had
gone
to
india
in
the
service
of
the
company
as
commissary
to
the
soldiers
stationed
at
fort
george
his
duties
were
those
of
a
clerk
he
was
now
years
old
but
had
had
no
experience
in
military
affairs
like
dupleix
however
he
seemed
to
comprehend
the
political
situation
of
the
country
and
when
the
emergency
came
that
called
forth
his
powers
he
was
found
to
possess
both
military
genius
and
profound
statesmanship
he
represented
to
the
officers
of
the
post
that
if
trichinopoly
now
besieged
by
chunda
sahib
and
his
french
allies
should
surrender
mohammed
ali
would
perish
and
french
influence
would
become
supreme
as
the
distance
of
trichinopoly
from
fort
george
was
so
great
as
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
marching
directly
to
the
assistance
of
their
ally
he
advocated
the
bold
project
of
making
a
diversion
by
a
sudden
attack
upon
arcot
the
capital
of
the
carnatic
and
the
favorite
residence
of
the
nabob
his
plans
were
approved
and
he
was
appointed
commander
to
carry
them
into
execution
the
young
captain
says
macaulay
was
put
at
the
head
of
two
hundred
english
soldiers
and
three
hundred
sepoys
armed
and
disciplined
after
the
english
fashion
the
weather
was
stormy
but
clive
pushed
on
through
thunder
lightning
and
rain
to
the
gates
of
arcot
the
garrison
in
a
panic
evacuated
the
fort
and
the
english
entered
it
without
a
blow
clive
immediately
began
to
collect
provisions
to
throw
up
works
and
make
preparations
for
sustaining
a
siege
the
garrison
which
had
fled
at
his
approach
had
now
recovered
from
its
dismay
and
to
the
number
of
three
thousand
men
it
encamped
close
to
the
town
at
dead
of
night
clive
marched
out
of
the
fort
attacked
the
camp
by
surprise
slew
great
numbers
dispersed
the
rest
and
returned
to
his
quarters
without
having
lost
a
single
man
the
news
of
the
fall
of
arcot
soon
reached
chunda
sahib
as
he
was
besieging
trichinopoly
an
army
under
the
command
of
his
son
rajah
sahib
numbering
ten
thousand
native
troops
and
one
hundred
and
fifty
frenchmen
was
immediately
dispatched
to
arcot
and
proceeded
to
invest
the
fort
which
seemed
quite
incapable
of
sustaining
a
siege
the
walls
were
ruinous
and
the
ditches
dry
the
garrison
reduced
by
casualties
now
consisted
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
english
soldiers
and
two
hundred
sepoys
the
stock
of
provisions
was
scanty
and
the
commander
was
a
youth
of
five
and
twenty
who
had
been
bred
a
during
fifty
days
the
siege
went
on
during
fifty
days
the
young
captain
maintained
the
defense
with
a
firmness
vigilance
and
ability
which
would
have
done
honor
to
the
oldest
marshal
in
europe
the
garrison
began
to
feel
the
pressure
of
hunger
at
this
juncture
the
sepoys
came
to
clive
not
to
complain
of
their
scanty
fare
but
to
propose
that
all
the
grain
should
be
given
to
the
europeans
who
required
more
nourishment
than
the
natives
of
asia
the
thin
gruel
they
said
which
was
strained
away
from
the
rice
would
suffice
for
themselves
the
devotion
of
clive
little
band
equaled
that
of
the
tenth
legion
of
caesar
or
of
the
old
guard
of
napoleon
clive
looked
for
succor
from
two
sources
an
attempt
made
by
the
government
at
madras
to
relieve
the
place
failed
but
there
was
still
hope
from
another
quarter
a
body
of
six
thousand
mahrattas
under
a
chief
named
morari
row
had
been
hired
to
assist
mohammed
ali
but
as
the
french
power
seemed
irresistible
this
force
bad
hitherto
remained
inactive
on
the
frontiers
of
the
carnatic
the
fame
of
the
defense
of
arcot
roused
them
from
their
torpor
rajah
sahib
learned
that
the
mahrattas
were
in
motion
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
be
expeditious
he
first
offered
large
bribes
to
clive
and
vowed
that
if
his
proposals
were
not
accepted
he
would
instantly
storm
the
fort
and
put
every
man
to
the
sword
clive
told
him
in
reply
that
his
father
was
a
usurper
and
that
his
army
was
a
rabble
and
that
he
would
do
well
to
think
twice
before
he
sent
such
poltroons
into
a
breach
defended
by
english
soldiers
rajah
sahib
determined
to
storm
the
fort
the
day
was
well
suited
to
a
bold
military
enterprise
it
was
the
great
mohammedan
festival
which
is
sacred
to
the
memory
of
hosein
the
son
of
ali
the
history
of
islam
contains
nothing
more
touching
than
the
event
which
gave
rise
to
that
solemnity
the
mournful
legend
relates
how
the
chief
of
the
fatimites
when
all
his
brave
followers
had
perished
round
him
drank
his
last
draught
of
water
and
uttered
his
latest
prayer
how
the
assassins
carried
his
head
in
triumph
smote
the
lifeless
lips
with
his
staff
and
how
a
few
old
men
recollected
with
tears
that
they
had
seen
those
lips
pressed
to
the
lips
of
the
prophet
of
god
after
the
lapse
of
near
twelve
centuries
the
recurrence
of
this
solemn
season
excites
the
fiercest
and
saddest
emotions
in
the
bosoms
of
the
devout
moslems
of
india
they
work
themselves
up
to
such
agonies
of
rage
and
lamentation
that
some
it
is
said
have
given
up
the
ghost
from
the
mere
effect
of
mental
excitement
they
believe
that
whoever
during
this
festival
falls
in
arms
against
the
infidels
atones
by
his
death
for
all
the
sins
of
life
and
passes
at
once
to
the
garden
of
the
houris
it
was
at
this
time
that
rajah
sahib
determined
to
assault
arcot
stimulating
drugs
were
employed
to
aid
the
effect
of
religious
zeal
and
the
besiegers
drunk
with
enthusiasm
drunk
with
bang
rushed
furiously
to
the
attack
clive
had
received
secret
intelligence
of
the
design
had
made
his
arrangements
and
exhausted
by
fatigue
had
thrown
himself
on
his
bed
he
was
awakened
by
the
alarm
and
was
instantly
at
his
post
the
enemy
advanced
driving
before
them
elephants
whose
foreheads
were
armed
with
iron
plates
it
was
expected
that
the
gates
would
yield
to
the
shock
of
these
living
but
the
huge
beasts
no
sooner
felt
the
english
than
they
turned
round
and
rushed
furiously
away
trampling
on
the
multitude
which
had
urged
them
forward
a
raft
was
launched
on
the
water
which
filled
one
part
of
the
ditch
clive
perceiving
that
his
gunners
at
that
post
did
not
understand
their
business
took
the
management
of
a
piece
of
artillery
himself
and
cleared
the
raft
in
a
few
minutes
where
the
moat
was
dry
the
assailants
mounted
with
great
boldness
but
they
were
received
with
a
fire
so
heavy
and
so
well
directed
that
it
soon
quelled
the
courage
even
of
fanaticism
and
intoxication
the
rear
ranks
of
the
english
kept
the
front
ranks
supplied
with
a
constant
succession
of
loaded
muskets
and
every
shot
told
on
the
living
mass
below
after
three
desperate
onsets
the
besiegers
retired
behind
the
ditch
the
struggle
lasted
about
an
hour
four
hundred
of
the
assailants
fell
the
garrison
lost
only
five
or
six
men
the
besieged
passed
an
anxious
night
looking
for
a
renewal
of
the
attack
but
when
day
broke
the
enemy
were
no
more
to
be
seen
they
had
retired
leaving
the
english
several
guns
and
a
large
quantity
of
ammunition
clive
immediately
began
offensive
operations
by
seven
hundred
english
troops
and
sepoys
from
madras
and
effecting
a
junction
with
the
auxiliary
mahratta
force
he
soon
overran
all
the
northern
carnatic
he
gained
a
complete
victory
over
rajah
army
of
five
thousand
natives
and
three
hundred
frenchmen
at
this
time
major
lawrence
arrived
from
england
and
assumed
the
command
an
expedition
marched
to
the
assistance
of
mohammed
ali
at
trichinopoly
the
besiegers
were
defeated
and
chunda
sahib
was
put
to
death
by
the
mahrattas
into
whose
hands
he
fell
the
english
were
now
masters
of
the
carnatic
and
the
french
influence
was
broken
steadily
the
english
power
was
extended
over
the
deccan
and
all
southern
india
dupleix
struggled
against
his
fate
in
vain
no
french
armament
came
to
his
assistance
his
company
condemned
his
policy
and
furnished
him
with
no
aid
but
still
he
persisted
bribed
intrigued
promised
lavished
his
private
fortune
and
everywhere
tried
to
raise
new
enemies
to
the
government
at
madras
but
all
to
no
purpose
at
length
when
his
last
hope
for
empire
died
out
broken
in
fortune
and
spirits
he
returned
to
his
native
country
to
die
obscure
and
neglected
clive
went
back
to
england
for
a
brief
space
but
after
a
year
or
two
he
returned
to
india
as
governor
of
madras
his
first
service
after
his
return
was
to
rout
out
a
nest
of
pirates
which
had
for
a
long
time
maintained
a
stronghold
upon
the
coast
he
then
turned
his
attention
to
reform
in
the
company
business
and
to
strengthening
british
influence
with
the
natives
in
all
directions
before
two
months
had
expired
he
received
intelligence
which
called
forth
all
the
energies
of
his
bold
and
active
mind
the
story
of
the
black
hole
of
the
large
provinces
into
which
the
mogul
empire
was
divided
the
wealthiest
was
bengal
no
part
of
india
possessed
such
natural
advantages
both
for
agriculture
and
commerce
the
ganges
rushing
through
a
hundred
channels
to
the
sea
has
formed
a
vast
plain
of
rich
mold
which
even
under
the
tropical
sky
rivals
the
verdure
of
an
english
april
the
yield
an
increase
such
as
is
elsewhere
unknown
spices
sugar
vegetable
oils
are
produced
with
marvelous
exuberance
the

an
inexhaustible
supply
of
fish
the
desolate
islands
along
the

with
noxious
vegetation

swarming
with

the

of

numbers

a
population
greater
than
that
of

the
race
by
which
this
rich
tract
was
peopled
enervated
by
a
soft
climate
and
accustomed
to
peaceful
employments
bore
the
same
relation
to
other
asiatics
which
the
asiatics
generally
bear
to
the
bold
and
energetic
children
of
europe
whatever
the
bengalee
does
he
does
languidly
his
favorite
pursuits
are
sedentary
he
shrinks
from
bodily
exertion
and
though
voluble
in
dispute
and
able
in
the
war
of
chicane
he
seldom
engages
in
a
personal
conflict
and
scarcely
ever
enlists
as
a
soldier
there
never
perhaps
existed
a
people
so
thoroughly
fitted
by
nature
and
by
habit
for
a
foreign
yoke
the
great
commercial
companies
of
europe
had
long
possessed
factories
in
bengal
the
french
the
dutch
and
the
english
had
stations
on
the
hoogly

chief
branch
of
the
ganges
of
these
the
english
fort
william
on
the
site
of
the
present
city
of
calcutta
was
nearest
the
sea
a
church
and
ample
warehouses
rose
in
the
vicinity
a
row
of
spacious
houses
belonging
to
the
chief
officers
of
the
east
india
company
lined
the
banks
of
the
river
and
in
the
neighborhood
had
sprung
up
a
large
and
busy
native
town
for
the
ground
on
which
the
settlement
stood
the
english
paid
rent
to
the
government
and
were
permitted
to
have
practical
control
of
their
own
domain
the
province
of
bengal
had
long
been
governed
by
a
viceroy
of
the
mogul
who
had
become
practically
independent
in
the
sovereignty
descended
to
a
youth
under
twenty
years
of
age
who
bore
the
name
of
surajah
dowlah
oriental
despots
are
perhaps
the
worst
class
of
human
beings
and
this
unhappy
boy
was
one
of
the
worst
specimens
of
his
class
his
understanding
was
naturally
feeble
and
his
temper
unamiable
his
education
had
been
such
as
would
have
enervated
even
a
vigorous
intellect
and
perverted
even
a
generous
disposition
he
was
unreasonable
because
nobody
ever
dared
to
reason
with
him
and
selfish
because
he
had
never
been
made
to
feel
himself
dependent
on
the
good
will
of
others
early
debauchery
had
unnerved
his
body
and
his
mind
he
indulged
immoderately
in
the
use
of
ardent
spirits
which
inflamed
his
weak
brain
almost
to
madness
his
chosen
companions
were
flatterers
sprung
from
the
dregs
of
the
people
it
is
said
that
he
had
arrived
at
the
last
stage
of
human
depravity
when
cruelty
becomes
pleasing
for
its
own
sake
when
the
sight
of
pain
as
pain
is
an
agreeable
excitement
it
had
early
been
his
amusement
to
torture
beasts
and
birds
and
when
he
grew
up
he
enjoyed
with
still
greater
relish
the
misery
of
his
from
a
child
surajah
dowlah
had
hated
the
english
it
was
his
whim
to
do
so
and
his
whims
were
never
opposed
he
had
formed
a
very
exaggerated
notion
of
the
wealth
which
might
be
obtained
by
plundering
them
and
his
feeble
mind
could
not
perceive
that
the
riches
of
calcutta
however
great
could
not
compensate
him
for
what
he
must
lose
if
the
european
trade
should
be
driven
by
his
violence
to
some
other
quarter
pretexts
for
a
quarrel
were
readily
found
and
surajah
dowlah
marched
with
a
great
army
against
fort
william
the
servants
of
the
company
at
madras
had
been
forced
to
become
statesmen
and
soldiers
those
in
bengal
were
still
mere
traders
and
were
in
no
condition
to
defend
themselves
against
the
formidable
attack
the
fort
was
taken
after
a
feeble
resistance
and
nearly
the
whole
english
population
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
conqueror
a
few
including
the
governor
had
saved
themselves
by
taking
refuge
in
the
ships
the
nabob
seated
himself
with
regal
pomp
in
the
principal
ball
of
the
factory
and
ordered
holwell
the
first
in
rank
among
the
prisoners
to
be
brought
before
him
his
highness
talked
about
the
insolence
of
the
english
and
grumbled
at
the
smallness
of
the
treasure
he
had
found
but
he
promised
to
spare
their
lives
and
retired
to
rest
then
was
committed
that
great
crime
memorable
for
its
singular
atrocity
memorable
for
the
terrible
retribution
by
which
it
was
followed
the
english
captives
were
left
to
the
mercy
of
the
guards
and
the
guards
determined
to
secure
them
for
the
night
in
the
prison
of
the
garrison
a
chamber
known
by
the
fearful
name
of
the
black
hole
the
space
was
only
twenty
feet
square
the
were
small
and
obstructed
it
was
the
summer
solstice
the
season
when
the
fierce
heat
of
bengal
can
scarcely
be
rendered
tolerable
to
natives
of
england
by
lofty
hills
and
by
the
constant
waving
of
fans
the
number
of
prisoners
was
one
hundred
and
and
they
were
driven
into
the
cell
at
the
point
of
the
sword
they
cried
for
mercy
they
strove
to
burst
the
door
holwell
offered
large
bribes
to
the
jailers
but
the
answer
was
that
nothing
could
be
done
without
the
nabob
orders
and
that
the
nabob
was
asleep
and
would
be
angry
if
anybody
waked
him
then
the
prisoners
went
mad
with
despair
and
fought
for
places
near
the
windows
where
they
might
obtain
air
the
jailers
in
the
mean
time
held
lights
at
the
bars
and
shouted
with
laughter
at
the
frantic
struggles
of
their
victims
at
length
the
tumult
died
away
in
low
gaspings
and
moanings
the
day
broke
the
nabob
had
slept
off
his
debauch
and
permitted
the
door
to
be
opened
ghastly
figures
staggered
out
of
the
one
hundred
and
bodies
were
hastily
thrown
into
a
pit
and
covered
up
and
the
black
hole
of
calcutta
has
gone
into
history
as
a
synonym
for
all
that
is
dreadful
and
all
that
is
possible
in
human
suffering
the
horror
which
daylight
revealed
awakened
neither
pity
nor
remorse
in
the
bosom
of
the
savage
nabob
he
inflicted
no
punishment
on
the
murderers
he
shoved
no
tenderness
to
the
survivors
he
sent
letters
to
the
court
of
delhi
describing
his
conquest
in
most
pompous
language
he
placed
a
garrison
at
fort
william
and
forbade
englishmen
to
dwell
in
the
neighborhood
clive
in
bengal
in
august
the
news
of
the
fall
of
calcutta
reached
madras
and
excited
the
fiercest
and
bitterest
resentment
the
cry
of
the
whole
settlement
was
for
vengeance
within
hours
after
the
arrival
of
the
intelligence
it
was
determined
that
an
expedition
should
be
sent
to
the
hoogly
and
that
clive
should
be
at
the
head
of
the
land
forces
the
naval
armament
was
under
the
command
of
admiral
watson
nine
hundred
english
infantry
and
fifteen
hundred
sepoys
sailed
to
punish
a
prince
who
ruled
over
of
people
in
october
the
expedition
sailed
but
it
had
to
make
its
way
against
adverse
winds
and
did
not
reach
bengal
until
december
in
the
mean
time
the
surajah
dowlah
was
reveling
in
fancied
security
he
was
so
ignorant
of
the
state
of
foreign
countries
that
he
often
used
to
say
that
there
were
not
ten
thousand
men
in
all
europe
and
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
possible
that
the
english
would
dare
to
invade
his
dominions
but
while
in
no
fear
of
the
english
he
began
to
miss
them
greatly
his
revenues
fell
off
and
his
ministers
at
length
made
him
understand
that
it
was
more
profitable
to
protect
traders
than
to
plunder
them
he
was
disposed
to
permit
the
company
to
resume
their
operations
when
he
heard
of
the
arrival
of
clive
in
the
hoogly
he
instantly
marched
with
his
troops
toward
calcutta
clive
commenced
operations
with
his
usual
vigor
he
routed
the
garrison
at
fort
william
recovered
calcutta
and
stormed
and
sacked
the
nabob
stations
along
the
river
the
nabob
alarmed
at
this
proof
of
power
and
spirit
made
overtures
of
peace
he
offered
to
restore
the
factory
and
to
give
compensation
to
those
whom
he
had
despoiled
clive
considering
the
disparity
of
his
force
and
the
uncertainty
of
war
consented
to
negotiate
the
terms
which
he
demanded
were
those
which
guaranteed
much
greater
power
to
the
english
than
they
ever
had
before
his
manner
was
cool
and
determined
as
though
conscious
of
possessing
power
sufficient
to
enforce
his
demands
the
nabob
behaved
with
all
the
faithlessness
of
an
indian
statesman
and
with
all
the
levity
of
a
boy
he
promised
retracted
hesitated
evaded
at
one
time
he
advanced
with
his
army
in
a
threatening
manner
toward
calcutta
but
when
he
saw
the
resolute
front
which
the
english
presented
be
fell
back
in
alarm
and
consented
to
make
peace
on
their
own
terms
the
treaty
was
no
sooner
concluded
than
he
formed
new
designs
against
them
he
intrigued
with
the
french
upon
the
hoogly
he
invited
the
french
force
in
the
deccan
to
come
and
drive
the
english
out
of
bengal
all
this
was
well
known
to
clive
and
watson
they
resolved
to
rid
themselves
of
one
source
of
danger
before
the
nabob
plans
were
consummated
they
attacked
the
french
factory
upon
the
hoogly
watson
directed
the
expedition
by
water
and
clive
by
land
their
success
was
rapid
and
complete
the
fort
the
garrison
the
artillery
the
military
stores
all
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
english
fresh
from
this
victory
clive
returned
to
his
negotiations
with
the
surajah
dowlah
the
nabob
was
confounded
by
this
sudden
movement
and
the
destruction
of
the
french
power
he
regarded
the
english
with
still
greater
fear
and
still
greater
hatred
he
oscillated
between
servility
and
insolence
one
day
he
sent
a
large
sum
to
calcutta
as
part
of
the
compensation
due
for
the
wrongs
he
had
committed
the
nest
day
he
sent
valuable
jewels
to
bussy
the
french
commander
in
the
deccan
imploring
that
officer
to
hasten
and
protect
bengal
against
clive
whom
all
bad
fortune
attend
he
ordered
his
army
to
march
against
the
english
he
countermanded
his
orders
he
tore
letters
he
sent
answers
in
the
most
florid
language
of
compliment
he
threatened
to
impale
watts
the
english
agent
he
sent
for
watts
and
begged
pardon
for
the
insult
in
the
mean
time
his
folly
his
vices
his
dissolute
manners
and
his
love
of
low
company
disgusted
all
classes
of
his
own
subjects
and
a
formidable
conspiracy
was
formed
against
him
in
his
own
capital
the
conspirators
entered
into
negotiation
with
clive
and
he
agreed
to
place
meer
jaffler
the
head
of
the
movement
upon
the
throne
of
bengal
in
his
diplomacy
clive
seems
to
have
laid
aside
his
character
as
a
bluff
soldier
and
to
have
taken
lessons
from
his
wily
and
treacherous
indian
foes
he
intrigued
and
deceived
until
the
last
moment
when
the
conspiracy
was
ripe
and
his
army
ready
the
moment
for
action
came
watts
the
english
agent
secretly
fled
and
took
refuge
in
calcutta
clive
put
his
troops
in
motion
and
wrote
to
the
nabob
a
letter
in
which
he
set
forth
the
english
wrongs
and
concluded
by
saying
that
as
the
rains
were
about
to
set
in
he
and
his
men
would
do
themselves
the
honor
of
waiting
upon
his
highness
for
an
answer
surajah
dowlah
instantly
assembled
his
whole
force
and
marched
to
encounter
the
english
it
had
been
arranged
that
meer
jaffier
should
separate
himself
from
the
nabob
and
carry
over
his
division
to
clive
but
as
the
decisive
moment
approached
the
fears
of
the
conspirator
overcame
his
ambition
clive
advanced
to
the
river
which
separated
him
from
his
foe
the
nabob
lay
with
a
mighty
power
a
few
miles
off
at
plassey
meer
jaffier
delayed
and
returned
evasive
answers
to
the
remonstrances
of
the
english
general
the
battle
and
its
results
clive
was
in
an
anxious
and
painful
situation
he
could
place
no
confidence
in
the
sincerity
or
the
courage
of
his
confederate
and
whatever
confidence
he
might
have
in
his
own
military
talents
and
in
the
valor
and
discipline
of
his
troops
it
was
no
light
thing
to
engage
an
army
twenty
times
as
numerous
as
his
own
before
him
lay
a
river
over
which
it
was
easy
to
advance
but
over
which
if
things
went
ill
not
one
of
his
little
band
would
return
on
this
occasion
for
the
first
and
for
the
last
time
his
dauntless
spirit
during
a
few
hours
shrank
from
the
fearful
responsibility
of
making
a
decision
he
called
a
council
of
war
the
majority
pronounced
against
fighting
and
clive
declared
his
concurrence
with
the
majority
long
afterward
he
said
that
he
had
never
called
but
one
council
of
war
and
that
if
he
had
taken
their
advice
the
british
would
never
have
been
masters
of
bengal
but
scarcely
had
the
meeting
broke
up
than
he
was
himself
again
he
retired
alone
under
the
shade
of
some
trees
and
passed
an
hour
there
in
thought
he
came
back
determined
to
take
the
risk
and
gave
orders
that
all
should
be
in
readiness
for
passing
the
river
on
the
morrow
the
river
was
passed
and
at
the
close
of
a
toilsome
march
the
army
long
after
sunset
took
up
its
quarters
in
a
grove
of
near
plassey
within
a
mile
of
the
enemy
clive
was
unable
to
steep
he
heard
through
the
night
the
sound
of
drums
and
cymbals
from
the
vast
camp
of
the
nabob
it
is
not
strange
that
even
his
stout
heart
should
now
and
then
have
sunk
when
he
reflected
against
what
odds
and
for
what
a
prize
he
was
in
a
few
hours
to
contend
nor
was
the
rest
of
surajah
dowlah
more
peaceful
his
mind
at
once
weak
and
stormy
was
distracted
by
wild
and
horrible
apprehensions
appalled
by
the
greatness
and
nearness
of
the
crisis
distrusting
his
captains
dreading
every
one
who
approached
him
dreading
to
be
left
alone
lie
sat
gloomily
in
his
tent
haunted
a
greek
poet
would
have
said
by
the
furies
of
those
who
had
cursed
him
with
their
last
breath
in
the
black
hole
the
day
broke
the
day
which
was
to
decide
the
fate
of
india
at
sunrise
the
army
of
the
nabob
pouring
through
many
openings
of
the
camp
began
to
move
toward
the
grove
where
the
english
lay
forty
thousand
infantry
armed
with
firelocks
pikes
swords
bows
and
arrows
covered
the
plain
they
were
accompanied
by
fifty
pieces
of
ordnance
of
the
largest
size
each
tugged
by
a
long
team
of
white
oxen
and
each
pushed
on
from
behind
by
an
elephant
some
smaller
guns
under
the
direction
of
french
soldiers
were
perhaps
more
formidable
the
cavalry
were
fifteen
thousand
drawn
from
the
bolder
races
which
inhabit
the
northern
provinces
and
the
practiced
eye
of
clive
could
perceive
that
the
men
and
horses
were
more
powerful
than
those
of
the
carnatic
the
force
opposed
to
this
great
multitude
consisted
of
only
three
thousand
men
but
of
these
nearly
one
thousand
were
english
and
all
were
led
by
english
officers
and
trained
in
the
english
discipline
the
battle
commenced
with
a
cannonade
in
which
the
artillery
of
the
nabob
did
scarcely
any
execution
while
the
of
the
english
produced
great
effect
several
officers
in
surajah
service
fell
disorder
began
to
spread
through
his
ranks
his
own
terror
increased
every
moment
one
of
the
conspirators
advised
him
to
retreat
this
advice
agreeing
as
it
did
with
what
his
own
terrors
suggested
was
readily
received
he
ordered
his
army
to
fall
back
and
this
order
decided
his
fate
clive
snatched
the
moment
and
ordered
his
troops
to
advance
the
confused
and
dispirited
multitude
gave
way
before
the
onset
of
disciplined
valor
no
mob
attacked
by
regular
soldiers
was
ever
more
completely
routed
the
little
band
of
frenchmen
who
alone
ventured
to
confront
the
english
were
swept
down
the
stream
of
the
fugitives
in
an
hour
the
forces
of
surajah
dowlah
were
dispersed
never
to
only
five
hundred
of
the
vanquished
were
slain
but
their
camp
their
guns
their
baggage
innumerable
wagons
innumerable
cattle
remained
in
the
power
of
the
conqueror
with
a
loss
of
soldiers
killed
and
fifty
wounded
clive
had
scattered
an
army
of
sixty
thousand
men
and
had
subdued
an
empire
larger
and
more
populous
than
great
britain
this
brilliant
success
of
clive
added
plassey
as
one
of
the
of
the
world
which
has
shaped
national
destinies
and
decided
the
fate
of
trillions
of
people
though
much
was
yet
to
be
done
before
the
fruits
of
victory
could
be
fully
realized
clive
at
once
became
almost
supreme
in
authority
surajah
dowlah
fled
in
disguise
and
disappeared
from
history
in
complete
obscurity
meer

held
clive
in
slavish
awe
he
once
reproved
a
native
of
high
rank
for
some
trouble
with
the
company
sepoys
are
you
yet
to
learn
he
said
who
colonel

in
what
station

the

was
i
affront
the
colonel
i
who
never
get
up
in
the
morning
without
making
three
low
bows
to
his
jackass
the
policy
inaugurated
by
clive
was
continued
by
his
successors
the
british
rule
was
extended
by
setting
up
native
princes
or
setting
them
aside
as
expediency
dictated
until
the
whole
vast

the

wild
exercise
of
irresponsible
power
has
been
corrected
and
governmental

under

rule
are
now
administered
on
the
foundation

the

no

from

of

all

the

the

in

had
accustomed
him
to
freedom
and
had
given
him
hardihood
his

were
broad

it
was

to
bind
burdens
upon
them
against

stern
purpose
to
subdue
hungry
for
affection
the
offspring
turned
his
face
toward
england
for
the
smallest
caress
and
the
east
wind
brought
back
across
the
atlantic
full
in
his
face
the
sharp
crack
of
a
whip
then
came
a
period
of
aggression
and
resistance
the
stamp
act
was
passed
but
stamp
could
not
be
sold
and
the
lives
of
became
miserable
soldiers
crowded
citizens
upon
boston
common
citizens
mobbed
the
soldiers
soldiers
fired
killing
five
citizens
and
were
saved
from
destruction
only
by
the
active
interference
of
the
patriot
leaders
this
affray
marked
the
first
shedding
of
blood
and
has
gone
into
history
as
the
boston
massacre
tea
was
taxed
but
the
matrons
took
to
catnip
and
sage
and
no
tea
was
sold
three
cargoes
of
taxed
tea
were
sent
into
boston
harbor
but
a
was
heard
the
vessels
were
boarded
by
a
band
of
painted
savages
tomahawk
in
band
the
were
broken
up
and
the
tea
was
thrown
into
the
water
this
last
act
demanded
special
punishment
and
the
boston
port
bill
shut
up
the
port
of
boston
allowing
no
ship
to
go
in
or
out
the
sympathetic
people
of
salem
and
marblehead
placed
wharf
and
warehouse
at
the
disposal
of
boston
merchants
softening
the
blow
as
much
as
possible
relief
to
the
suffering
poor
of
boston
poured
in
from
all
sides
and
the
british
ministry
saw
that
the
whole
people
were
making
common
cause
in
resistance
to
oppression
the
next
step
is
the
vigorous
use
of
the
strong
arm
filial
love
must
be
forced
in
by
means
of
bayonets
and
affection
secured
by
gunpowder
and
bullets
a
strong
force
of
soldiers
under
general
gage
took
possession
of
boston
the
troops
were
quartered
in
the
city
hall
and
other
buildings
sacred
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
to
justice
and
peace
the
city
government
was
superseded
by
the
military
sentinels
patrolled
the
streets
arbitrary
edicts
took
the
place
of
law
citizens
were
interfered
with
while
in
the
pursuit
of
private
business
for
soldiers
insults
there
was
no
redress
the
leading
patriots
john
adams
joseph
warren
james
otis
john
hancock
and
samuel
adams
were
hunted
and
a
price
was
set
on
their
heads
boston
was
in
the
strong
hands
of
military
power
outwardly
it
was
subdued
but
beneath
was
a
seething
fire
ready
to
burst
into
flame
when
the
moment
for
conflagration
should
arrive
but
massachusetts
was
aroused
town
and
country
were
one
the
war
spirit
invoked
engendered
its
kind
committees
of
safety
were
formed
in
every
town
the
drum
and
fife
echoed
from
mountain
to
valley
the
musket
of
the
old
war
the
of
the
sportsman
and
the
rifle
of
the
hunter
were
brought
from
their
and
prepared
for
use
forge
and
hammer
were
busy
in
making
guns
and
swords
in
every
hamlet
prepared
to
march
on
the
moment
nor
were
the
women
idle
wheel
and
loom
were
busy
as
never
before
the
patriot
soldier
starting
for
the
front
was
clad
in
serviceable
prepared
by
loving
hands
and
he
departed
amid
the
tears
prayers
and
blessings
of
loving
yet
steadfast
hearts
the
general
court
of
massachusetts
was
convened
it
was
denounced
and
proscribed
by
general
gage
but
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
its
mandates
had
all
the
force
of
law
taxes
were
levied
and
cheerfully
paid
the
colony
was
divided
into
military
districts
and
each
one
placed
under
the
command
of
a
competent
officer
powder
arms
and
other
military
stores
were
collected
and
all
needful
preparations
were
made
for
war
the
other
new
england
colonies
fully
shared
in
the
excitement
of
massachusetts
the
note
of
alarm
spread
through
the
land
and
a
continental
congress
was
called
to
meet
at
philadelphia
to
consider
the
policy
best
to
be
pursued
for
the
common
weal
but
general
gage
became
impatient
he
would
strike
a
blow
that
would
at
once
assert
british
power
and
terrify
the
whole
rebel
race
the
mailed
hand
must
be
seen
beneath
the
soft
glove
the
opportunity
was
not
long
wanting
a
military
depot
at
concord
eighteen
miles
northwest
of
boston
he
determined
to
seize
a
force
of
eight
hundred
men
under
smith
and
major
pitcairn
was
to
set
out
on
the
evening
of
april
the
patriot
leaders
were
early
aware
that
some
movement
was
on
foot
and
eager
eyes
watched
for
indications
of
its
force
and
direction
but
it
was
kept
a
profound
secret
and
it
was
not
until
the
troops
were
upon
the
march
that
their
destination
could
be
guessed
let
the
poet
tell
how
the
purpose
was
discovered
and
the
news
carried
to
the
country
illustration
revere
paul
revere
ride
listen
my
children
and
you
shall
hear
of
the
midnight
ride
of
paul
revere
on
the
eighteenth
of
april
hardly
a
man
is
now
alive
who
remembers
that
famous
day
and
year
he
said
to
his
friend
if
the
british
march
by
land
or
sea
from
the
town
hang
a
lantern
aloft
in
the
belfry
arch
in
the
north
church
tower
as
a
signal
light
one
if
by
land
and
two
if
by
sea
and
i
on
the
opposite
shore
will
be
ready
to
ride
and
spread
the
alarm
through
every
middlesex
village
and
farm
for
the
country
folk
to
be
up
and
to
arm
then
he
said
good
night
and
with
muffled
oar
silently
rowed
to
the
charlestown
shore
just
as
the
moon
rose
over
the
bay
where
swinging
wide
at
her
moorings
lay
the
somerset
british
a
phantom
ship
with
each
mast
and
spar
across
the
moon
like
a
prison
bar
and
a
huge
black
hulk
that
was
magnified
by
its
own
reflection
in
the
tide
meanwhile
his
friend
through
alley
and
street
watches
and
wanders
with
eager
ears
till
in
the
silence
around
him
he
hears
the
muster
of
men
at
the
barrack
door
the
sound
of
arms
and
the
tramp
of
feet
and
the
measured
tread
of
the
grenadiers
marching
down
to
their
boats
on
the
shore
then
he
climbed
the
tower
of
the
old
north
church
by
the
wooden
stairs
with
stealthy
tread
to
the
belfry
chamber
overhead
and
startled
the
pigeons
from
their
perch
on
the
somber
rafters
that
round
him
made
masses
and
moving
shapes
of
shade
by
the
trembling
ladder
steep
and
tall
to
the
highest
window
in
the
wall
where
he
paused
to
listen
and
look
down
a
moment
on
the
roofs
of
the
town
and
the
moonlight
flowing
over
all
beneath
in
the
churchyard
lay
the
dead
in
their
on
the
hill
wrapped
in
a
silence
so
deep
and
still
that
he
could
hear
like
a
sentinel
tread
the
watchful
as
it
went
creeping
along
from
tent
to
tent
and
seeming
to
whisper
all
is
well
a
moment
only
he
feels
the
spell
of
the
place
and
the
hour
and
the
secret
dread
of
the
lonely
belfry
and
the
dead
for
suddenly
all
his
thoughts
were
bent
on
a
shadowy
something
far
away
where
the
river
widens
to
meet
the
bay
a
line
of
black
that
bends
and
floats
on
the
rising
tide
like
a
bridge
of
boats
meanwhile
impatient
to
mount
and
ride
booted
and
spurred
with
a
heavy
stride
on
the
opposite
shore
walked
paul
revere
now
he
patted
his
horse
side
now
gazed
on
the
landscape
far
and
near
then
impetuous
stamped
the
earth
and
turned
and
tightened
his
but
mostly
lie
watched
with
eager
search
the
of
the
old
north
church
as
it
rose
above
the
graves
on
the
hill
lonely
and
spectral
and
somber
and
still
and
lo
as
he
looks
on
the
belfry
height
a
glimmer
and
then
a
gleam
of
light
he
springs
to
the
saddle
the
bridle
he
turns
but
lingers
and
gazes
till
full
on
his
sight
a
second
lamp
in
the
belfry
burns
a
hurry
of
hoofs
in
the
village
street
a
shape
in
the
moonlight
a
bulk
in
the
dark
and
beneath
from
the
pebbles
in
passing
a
spark
struck
out
by
a
steed
flying
fearless
and
fleet
that
was
all
and
yet
through
the
gloom
and
the
light
the
fate
of
a
nation
was
riding
that
night
and
the
spark
struck
out
by
that
steed
in
its
flight
kindled
the
land
into
flame
with
its
heat
the
british
column
moved
on
through
the
darkness
with
no
sound
save
the
steady
tread
of
marching
feet
at
first
and
hamlet
were
wrapped
in
a
deep
repose
but
as
the
night
wore
on
signs
of
life
began
to
appear
at
every
horsemen
galloped
off
at
their
approach
and
hurried
lights
at
chamber
windows
showed
that
slumber
had
been
suddenly
interrupted
at
the
invading
force
reached
lexington
a
little
village
twelve
miles
from
boston
here
to
the
number
of
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
aroused
by
the
cry
of
paul
revere
had
hastily
assembled
they
offered
no
opposition
to
the
british
troops
but
stood
silent
spectators
to
the
unusual
sight
illustration
the
fight
at
lexington
the
british
column
halted
and
major
pitcairn
rode
forward
and
in
the
most
peremptory
tone
of
command
cried
out
disperse
you
rebels
throw
down
your
arms
and
disperse
no
one
obeyed
and
he
gave
the
order
to
fire
out
blazed
the
muskets
and
what
remained
of
the
little
group
sought
safety
in
flight
the
british
marched
on
leaving
on
that
peaceful
common
under
the
very
shadow
of
the
church
eight
figures
stark
and
motionless
in
death
from
this
baptism
of
blood
they
moved
on
regretful
perhaps
at
the
stern
necessity
of
their
action
but
rejoicing
that
all
opposition
had
been
so
easily
and
completely
overcome
on
they
sped
the
sun
arose
in
its
glory
to
cheer
them
on
their
march
their
thoughts
were
jubilant
as
in
fancy
they
posed
as
heroes
before
their
fellows
left
behind
no
vision
of
the
dead
men
staring
upward
from
the
grass
of
lexington
haunted
them
the
silent
march
of
the
night
had
ended
and
now
they
could
press
onward
with
clatter
and
song
the
six
miles
to
concord
were
soon
passed
over
a
strong
guard
was
left
at
the
bridge
for
with
all
his
confidence
colonel
smith
was
a
skillful
commander
and
would
neglect
no
precaution
to
secure
the
safety
of
his
troops
so
careful
was
he
that
he
sent
back
a
secret
messenger
from
lexington
for
more
men
on
press
the
exulting
soldiers
on
through
the
streets
of
concord
in
search
of
the
military
stores
but
lo
they
had
taken
wings
and
flown
to
a
place
of
safety
a
few
barrels
of
flour
half
destroyed
a
few
hundred
thrown
into
wells
was
the
sole
outcome
of
the
intended
destruction
the
committee
of
safety
had
performed
their
duty
discreetly
and
in
time
but
hark
what
means
that
musketry
not
the
scattering
fire
of
a
skirmish
but
volley
answering
volley
has
the
impossible
come
to
pass
have
the
rebels
dared
to
fire
upon
the
king
troops
but
the
firing
grows
warmer
louder
hasten
to
the
bridge
lest
retreat
be
cut
off
the
guards
sore
beset
welcome
the
aid
armed
foes
spring
up
on
every
side
they
are
behind
before
everywhere
no
safety
now
but
in
instant
rapid
retreat
you
know
the
rest
in
the
books
you
have
read
how
the
british
regulars
fired
and
fled
how
the
farmers
gave
them
ball
for
ball
from
behind
each
fence
and
wall
chasing
the
down
the
lane
then
crossing
the
fields
to
emerge
again
under
the
trees
at
the
bend
of
the
road
and
only
pausing
to
fire
and
load
discipline
and
valor
are
of
no
avail
here
vollied
musketry
has
little
chance
against
backwoods
sharpshooters
occupying
every
vantage
ground
that
their
knowledge
of
the
country
enabled
them
to
do
the
day
was
wearing
on
noon
found
them
a
disorganized
mass
flying
through
lexington
streets
the
scene
of
their
morning
victory
in
the
mean
time
lord
percy
with
eight
hundred
fresh
troops
and
two
is
marching
out
on
the
lexington
road
not
that
any
danger
was
apprehended
but
simply
as
a
precautionary
measure
between
two
and
three
while
yet
two
miles
short
of
lexington
ominous
sounds
of
conflict
smote
his
ears
not
the
rolling
volleys
and
stately
tread
of
victory
but
the
confused
noise
of
fight
and
flight
betokening
irretrievable
disaster
the
fresh
troops
were
formed
into
a
hollow
square
and
the
hunted
fugitives
came
rushing
into
their
place
of
refuge
exhausted
by
their
long
march
and
hot
fight
many
of
them
fell
prone
upon
the
ground
their
tongues
says
a
high
authority
hanging
out
of
their
mouths
but
lord
percy
must
not
delay
ten
miles
lie
between
him
and
safety
and
many
hours
of
day
remain
before
darkness
will
lend
its
friendly
aid
short
time
for
rest
beat
off
the
fierce
and
persistent
attacks
speed
away
while
yet
unsurrounded
a
british
army
must
never
suffer
the
humiliation
of
defeat
and
capture
by
a
horde
of
rebel
yankees
so
through
the
afternoon
the
marched
quickly
sullenly
dejectedly
fighting
desperately
for
very
life
the
day
closed
as
they
neared
the
river
and
under
the
starlight
they
embarked
finding
safety
and
rest
at
last
not
quite
yet
for
as
the
last
boat
left
the
shore
a
rifle
blazed
out
and
one
more
victim
was
sent
to
atone
for
the
wanton
murder
on
lexington
common
the
eventful
day
ended
with
a
loss
on
the
part
of
the
british
of
two
hundred
and
while
the
aggregate
loss
of
the
patriots
was
one
hundred
and
five
without
discipline
and
with
the
most
reckless
exposure
to
danger
they
had
inflicted
a
loss
nearly
three
times
as
great
as
they
had
sustained
the
news
of
lexington
spread
everywhere
producing
wild
excitement
the
notes
of
warlike
preparation
were
heard
throughout
the
land
with
deliberate
purpose
general
gage
had
sown
the
teeth
and
there
literally
sprung
up
a
bountiful
crop
of
armed
men
every
village
and
every
helped
to
swell
the
number
the
remotest
hamlet
furnished
its
contingent
in
distant
connecticut
gallant
old
general
putnam
heard
the
news
while
plowing
prompt
as
when
he
dragged
the
wolf
from
its
den
he
unyoked
his
oxen
left
his
plow
in
the
furrow
and
leaping
to
his
saddle
galloped
to
the
fray
fiery
ethan
allen
at
the
head
of
his
green
mountain
boys
was
eager
to
march
but
paused
to
execute
that
marvelous
enterprise
which
secured
for
the
patriot
cause
the
formidable
fortresses
of
ticonderoga
and
crown
point
with
all
their
military
stores
day
by
day
the
multitude
increased
until
thirty
thousand
men
were
encamped
around
boston
from
charlestown
neck
to
dorchester
from
the
evening
of
the
lexington
fight
general
gage
was
shut
up
in
boston
the
patriots
kept
a
strict
guard
on
every
road
and
no
parties
were
permitted
to
pass
out
or
provisions
to
pass
in
all
supplies
for
the
town
came
by
sea
the
officers
chafed
under
the
enforced
inactivity
they
would
be
done
with
the
ignoble
work
of
defense
behind
fortifications
they
longed
for
an
opportunity
to
regain
the
prestige
lost
on
that
fatal
nineteenth
of
april
but
general
gage
was
too
wise
a
commander
to
risk
the
safety
of
his
army
so
he
held
the
impatience
of
his
officers
in
check
and
awaited
events
the
patriot
leaders
were
equally
impatient
the
enthusiasm
of
the
moment
must
be
turned
to
good
account
the
men
were
all
unused
to
living
in
camps
and
were
peculiarly
exposed
to
camp
diseases
and
camp
vices
discipline
had
not
yet
counteracted
the
demoralizing
tendencies
of
army
life
the
different
divisions
of
the
army
were
ranged
under
favorite
local
leaders
and
while
there
was
some
show
of
order
there
was
little
or
no
concert
of
action
it
was
now
the
middle
of
june
two
months
had
elapsed
since
lord
percy
was
driven
back
into
boston
all
means
to
lure
general
gage
from
the
town
had
failed
and
an
aggressive
movement
was
devised
it
was
resolved
to
take
a
new
position
threatening
the
town
and
the
shipping
in
the
port
the
place
selected
was
the
highland
on
the
charlestown
peninsula
known
as
bunker
hill
and
the
time
fixed
upon
for
the
enterprise
the
night
of
june
eight
hundred
men
armed
with
shovels
and
picks
assembled
at
six
the
movement
was
known
to
be
a
perilous
one
and
every
man
felt
that
he
took
his
life
in
his
hand
president
langdon
of
harvard
college
offered
prayer
with
the
ancient
puritan
fervor
colonel
prescott
took
command
of
the
military
operations
and
colonel
gridley
conducted
the
engineering
in
early
evening
they
set
out
the
march
was
in
profound
silence
with
suppressed
breathing
and
stealthy
tread
they
made
their
way
an
army
of
ghosts
entering
the
land
of
shadows
but
the
grim
faces
of
the
officers
and
the
clinched
hands
of
the
men
showed
more
than
ghostly
purpose
about
midnight
the
march
ceased
clear
in
the
starlight
they
could
see
british
ship
and
camp
and
could
hear
the
sentinel
proclaim
all
is
well
a
redoubt
eight
rods
square
was
laid
out
and
these
eight
hundred
husbandmen
bent
their
seasoned
muscles
to
the
work
the
embankment
grew
up
in
the
darkness
and
at
its
six
feet
of
height
amply
protected
the
workers
within
in
the
american
camp
all
was
excitement
and
expectation
supporting
parties
were
organized
supplies
hurried
up
and
means
for
and
retreat
provided
it
was
now
that
the
fatal
weakness
of
the
patriot
organization
was
made
manifest
different
leaders
had
notions
inconsistent
with
each
other
and
divided
councils
led
to
indecisive
action
the
brunt
of
the
coming
engagement
was
left
to
one
tenth
of
the
patriot
forces
scarred
veterans
scented
the
battle
from
afar
and
hastened
to
the
front
to
share
the
danger
and
the
glory
with
no
command
officers
were
content
to
act
as
volunteers
and
handle
muskets
putnam
with
military
foresight
took
charge
of
the
line
of
communication
and
with
true
farmer
instinct
he
converted
two
and
a
field
of
hay
into
a
line
of
serviceable
breastworks
reaching
across
charlestown
neck
into
the
country
at
the
astonished
britons
gazed
upon
this
vision
of
the
night
a
moment
pause
then
instantaneous
rapid
action
that
nocturnal
growth
threatened
their
very
lives
those
audacious
and
insolent
rebels
must
be
swept
from
existence
without
orders
the
boston
battery
at
copp
hill
opened
upon
the
redoubt
as
soon
as
it
was
discovered
ships
in
the
bay
poured
in
furious
broadsides
the
cannonade
awoke
boston
from
her
slumbers
citizens
half
dressed
rushed
into
the
streets
every
roof
and
steeple
that
commanded
a
view
of
the
scene
was
soon
crowded
with
anxious
spectators
who
remained
there
during
the
livelong
day
patriot
and
royalist
mingled
and
fierce
passions
and
wordy
wars
accompanied
the
progress
of
the
conflict
outside
exultation
at
patriot
success
was
often
too
great
to
be
suppressed
and
wild
cheers
sounded
from
the
and
echoed
through
the
streets
so
passed
the
forenoon
the
little
band
on
the
hill
protected
by
the
worked
on
with
speed
and
safety
the
hurtling
masses
of
iron
aimed
at
their
destruction
either
buried
themselves
in
the
yielding
earth
or
passed
overhead
without
injury
one
man
only
paid
with
his
life
the
penalty
of
his
curiosity
in
looking
over
the
breastworks
an
early
luncheon
was
served
and
then
work
again
but
even
iron
muscles
have
their
limit
of
endurance
and
the
grew
less
rapidly
as
the
day
wore
on
until
at
high
noon
work
altogether
ceased
but
what
of
the
enemy
by
this
time
they
are
aware
of
the
uselessness
of
their
cannonade
other
and
stronger
measures
must
be
taken
and
that
on
the
instant
the
military
renown
gained
on
so
many
must
not
be
lost
in
a
conflict
with
rude
peasants
the
best
point
of
vantage
in
a
general
war
must
not
be
lost
to
the
king
every
sentiment
of
ambition
and
loyalty
urged
to
action
a
ship
dropped
down
the
river
and
took
position
to
command
charlestown
neck
but
the
and
the
hay
resisted
the
shock
and
the
american
line
remained
unturned
rough
old
putnam
foresight
became
an
important
factor
in
the
day
conflict
suddenly
the
drum
loud
beat
and
the
shrill
scream
of
the
fife
startled
all
hearts
into
a
fiercer
life
the
notes
with
no
tremor
of
fear
rang
out
sonorous
triumphant
for
centuries
such
notes
had
led
britons
to
victory
and
british
soldiers
will
do
or
die
four
thousand
grenadiers
under
lord
howe
march
down
to
the
shore
with
the
quick
elastic
tread
of
soldiers
upon
a
holiday
excursion
in
that
resolute
front
and
precision
of
movement
there
was
little
to
raise
the
spirits
or
inspire
hope
in
the
hearts
of
the
thousands
of
patriotic
observers
who
were
watching
the
movements
with
feverish
anxiety
in
perfect
order
they
embark
and
in
perfect
order
they
land
upon
the
charlestown
shore
in
their
advance
toward
the
silent
redoubt
no
line
wavered
and
no
step
faltered
though
every
man
was
aware
of
the
fearful
peril
before
him
within
the
little
all
was
activity
and
expectation
pomeroy
stark
putnam
came
to
help
not
to
dictate
at
the
last
moment
general
warren
from
the
state
committee
of
safety
unable
to
conceal
his
anxiety
came
and
took
his
place
in
the
ranks
these
officers
all
outranked
colonel
prescott
but
neither
of
them
would
take
the
command
from
the
officer
who
had
proved
himself
capable
and
worthy
of
it
shovels
and
picks
gave
place
to
rifles
and
muskets
and
as
experienced
eyes
glanced
along
the
tubes
grave
smiles
lit
up
rugged
faces
at
the
thought
of
the
welcome
the
enemy
would
soon
receive
be
steady
be
firm
is
the
parting
injunction
of
putnam
as
he
takes
his
way
to
his
command
at
the
we
must
conquer
or
die
is
the
sentiment
of
warren
as
he
grasps
the
musket
of
a
common
soldier
showing
to
the
last
that
noble
patriotism
which
makes
his
name
so
dear
to
all
who
love
their
country
keep
cool
wait
until
you
see
the
color
of
their
eyes
aim
at
their
red
coats
pick
off
their
commanders
are
the
fiery
last
commands
of
prescott
as
the
scarlet
column
moved
up
the
hill
each
soldier
is
in
place
each
eye
unflinchingly
is
fixed
on
the
enemy
and
each
right
hand
is
pressed
upon
the
musket
ready
for
the
supreme
moment
the
batteries
which
had
been
covering
the
advancing
columns
ceased
as
they
neared
the
summit
an
ominous
silence
succeeded
the
tumult
of
the
preceding
hours
no
sound
is
heard
but
the
short
quick
words
of
command
in
the
british
ranks
and
the
steady
tread
of
the
marching
files
the
space
had
diminished
to
a
few
rods
and
still
a
silence
wrapped
the
redoubt
at
the
last
moment
had
the
hearts
of
the
patriots
failed
did
the
near
approach
of
the
deprive
them
of
their
courage
by
the
forward
march
rang
out
from
the
british
lines
a
sudden
rush
and
one
deafening
volley
was
it
lightning
from
heaven
that
struck
down
every
man
in
their
first
rank
was
it
the
earthquake
shock
that
left
those
long
lines
of
dead
heaped
like
grass
before
the
mower
scythe
the
rear
ranks
paralyzed
by
the
terrible
disaster
held
their
ground
but
no
human
courage
could
withstand
the
fire
that
blazed
fierce
and
merciless
from
the
redoubt
a
moment
pause
and
then
a
wild
headlong
flight
to
the
sheltering
boats
on
the
shore
as
shouts
of
triumph
went
up
from
thousands
of
sympathizing
hearts
the
contending
forces
were
in
a
state
of
intense
activity
within
the
breastworks
prescott
cool
deliberate
masterful
watched
every
detail
and
directed
every
action
warren
stark
and
pomeroy
put
soul
into
every
movement
putnam
defended
his
own
line
and
sent
the
good
news
outward
to
cheer
the
thousands
who
had
taken
no
part
in
the
contest
and
to
urge
immediate
in
the
british
quarters
new
officers
took
the
place
of
those
who
lay
stretched
on
the
the
men
were
rallied
and
reformed
new
regiments
came
over
from
boston
and
again
four
thousand
men
breasted
the
hill
and
marched
up
to
the
breastworks
with
colors
flying
and
drums
beating
this
time
they
were
permitted
to
come
within
the
reach
of
friendly
greeting
when
again
a
solid
sheet
of
flame
leaped
forth
from
the
breastworks
again
covering
the
earth
with
the
dead
the
rear
columns
for
a
few
moments
stood
fast
but
nothing
could
withstand
that
hail
of
shot
aimed
to
take
life
and
again
they
fled
to
the
shore
the
day
was
wearing
on
it
was
now
five
if
the
americans
can
hold
on
until
the
friendly
darkness
sets
in
they
may
retain
possession
of
charlestown
and
force
the
british
to
evacuate
boston
general
ward
was
at
cambridge
trying
in
vain
to
secure
order
in
time
for
action
general
knox
ranged
up
and
down
the
lines
frantically
urging
the
men
to
follow
him
to
the
fray
putnam
blazing
with
excitement
and
fully
comprehending
the
danger
was
everywhere
animating
and
urging
on
the
fresh
troops
now
he
sent
almost
frantic
appeals
for
powder
now
he
implored
the
men
in
reserve
to
move
at
once
and
now
he
rallied
his
own
men
to
repel
the
attack
upon
his
own
lines
a
considerable
force
was
at
last
rallied
to
march
but
upon
reaching
charlestown
neck
the
firing
from
the
british
ships
was
so
deadly
that
they
dared
not
venture
to
cross
in
the
redoubt
was
the
courage
of
despair
the
powder
had
given
out
and
for
many
of
the
muskets
only
a
single
cartridge
remained
to
meet
the
coming
charge
but
all
remained
firm
while
the
sun
slowly
sunk
in
the
west
after
their
second
repulse
the
force
under
lord
howe
cowed
and
demoralized
refuse
to
again
advance
into
the
jaws
of
death
the
idea
is
gaining
ground
that
the
rebel
position
is
impregnable
and
that
a
wise
policy
demands
that
no
more
blood
shall
be
shed
in
a
vain
endeavor
to
reduce
it
the
impetuous
sir
henry
clinton
refuses
to
take
this
view
of
the
situation
and
his
counsels
are
heeded
every
military
resource
at
the
command
of
general
gage
is
now
brought
into
requisition
all
the
ships
in
the
harbor
are
ordered
to
direct
their
fire
upon
the
fort
and
the
line
of
communication
new
batteries
are
erected
by
competent
engineers
to
sweep
through
the
outer
breastworks
and
render
them
untenable
the
reserve
forces
are
ordered
up
and
every
available
man
is
in
the
ranks
the
charge
must
now
be
made
on
every
side
and
the
little
band
of
eight
hundred
literally
crushed
by
numbers
all
this
and
the
final
charge
must
be
made
within
the
few
hours
of
remaining
daylight
or
british
power
is
forever
at
an
end
in
america
at
last
all
preparation
ends
and
the
time
for
action
arrives
shot
from
the
new
batteries
drive
the
defenders
with
severe
loss
within
their
interior
defenses
the
advance
of
the
swarming
enemies
is
met
with
a
feeble
scattering
fire
in
place
of
the
volleyed
death
of
the
previous
charges
showers
of
stones
and
blows
from
clubbed
muskets
greet
those
who
first
mount
the
ramparts
but
nothing
could
resist
the
last
desperate
bayonet
charge
of
the
british
the
defenders
of
the
fort
slowly
and
sullenly
retired
before
the
overwhelming
numbers
of
their
adversaries
at
the
last
moment
major
pitcairn
meets
his
death
and
thus
expiates
as
far
as
possible
his
bloody
orders
at
lexington
at
nearly
the
same
moment
general
warren
in
the
very
rear
of
the
retreating
troops
is
shot
sealing
with
his
life
his
devotion
to
his
country
that
the
retreating
americans
were
not
annihilated
was
due
to
the
of
general
putnam
and
to
his
skill
in
holding
the
enemy
in
check
while
the
flying
fugitives
found
safety
in
