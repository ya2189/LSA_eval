introduction
the
present
volume
has
been
published
with
two
main
objects
the
writer
has
attempted
to
exhibit
in
outline
the
leading
features
of
the
international
history
of
the
two
countries
which
in
became
the
united
kingdom
relations
with
england
form
a
large
part
and
the
heroic
part
of
scottish
history
relations
with
scotland
a
very
much
smaller
part
of
english
history
the
result
has
been
that
in
histories
of
england
references
to
relations
are
occasional
and
spasmodic
while
students
of
scottish
history
have
occasionally
forgotten
that
in
regard
to
her
southern
neighbour
the
attitude
of
scotland
was
not
always
on
the
heroic
scale
scotland
appears
on
the
horizon
of
english
history
only
during
epochs
leaving
no
trace
of
its
existence
in
the
intervals
between
these
it
may
be
that
the
space
given
to
scotland
in
the
ordinary
histories
of
england
is
proportional
to
the
importance
of
scottish
affairs
on
the
whole
but
the
importance
assigned
to
relations
in
the
fourteenth
century
is
quite
disproportionate
to
the
treatment
of
the
same
subject
in
the
fifteenth
century
readers
even
of
green
famous
book
may
learn
with
surprise
from
lang
or
hume
brown
the
part
played
by
the
scots
in
the
loss
of
the
english
dominions
in
france
or
may
fail
to
understand
the
references
to
scotland
in
the
diplomatic
correspondence
of
the
sixteenth
century
there
seems
to
be
therefore
room
for
a
connected
narrative
of
the
attitude
of
the
two
countries
towards
each
other
for
only
thus
is
it
possible
to
provide
the
requisite
for
a
fair
appreciation
of
the
policy
of
edward
i
and
henry
viii
or
of
elizabeth
and
james
i
such
a
narrative
is
here
presented
in
outline
and
the
writer
has
tried
as
far
as
might
be
to
eliminate
from
his
work
the
element
of
national
prejudice
the
book
has
also
another
aim
the
relations
between
england
and
scotland
have
not
been
a
purely
political
connexion
the
peoples
have
from
an
early
date
been
to
some
extent
intermingled
and
this
mixture
of
blood
renders
necessary
some
account
of
the
racial
relationship
it
has
been
a
favourite
theme
of
the
english
historians
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
the
portions
of
scotland
where
the
gaelic
tongue
has
ceased
to
be
spoken
are
not
really
scottish
but
english
the
scots
who
resisted
edward
wrote
freeman
were
the
english
of
lothian
the
true
scots
out
of
hatred
to
the
nearest
to
them
leagued
with
the
farther
off
green
writing
of
the
time
of
edward
i
says
the
farmer
of
fife
or
the
lowlands
and
the
artisan
of
the
towns
remained
northumbrian
englishmen
and
he
adds
that
the
coast
districts
north
of
the
tay
were
inhabited
by
a
population
of
the
same
blood
as
that
of
the
lowlands
the
theory
has
been
at
all
events
verbally
accepted
by
lang
who
describes
the
history
of
scotland
as
the
record
of
the
long
resistance
of
the
english
of
scotland
to
england
of
the
long
resistance
of
the
celts
of
scotland
to
the
english
of
scotland
above
all
the
conception
has
been
firmly
planted
in
the
imagination
by
the
poet
of
the
of
the
these
fertile
plains
that
soften
vale
were
once
the
birthright
of
the
gael
the
stranger
came
with
iron
hand
and
from
our
fathers
reft
the
land
while
holding
in
profound
respect
these
illustrious
names
the
writer
ventures
to
ask
for
a
modification
of
this
verdict
that
the
scottish
lowlanders
among
whom
we
include
the
inhabitants
of
the
coast
districts
from
the
tay
to
the
moray
firth
were
in
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
english
in
speech
and
manners
as
oman
guardedly
describes
them
is
beyond
doubt
were
they
also
english
in
blood
the
evidence
upon
which
the
accepted
theory
is
founded
is
twofold
in
the
course
of
the
sixth
century
the
angles
made
a
descent
between
the
humber
and
the
forth
and
that
district
became
part
of
the
english
kingdom
of
northumbria
even
here
we
have
in
the
evidence
of
the
some
reasons
for
believing
that
a
proportion
of
the
original
brythonic
population
may
have
survived
this
northern
portion
of
the
kingdom
of
northumbria
was
affected
by
the
danish
invasions
but
it
remained
an
anglian
kingdom
till
its
conquest
in
the
beginning
of
the
eleventh
century
by
the
celtic
king
malcolm
ii
there
is
thus
sufficient
justification
for
freeman
phrase
the
english
of
lothian
if
we
interpret
the
term
lothian
in
the
strict
sense
but
it
remains
to
be
explained
how
the
inhabitants
of
the
scottish
lowlands
outside
lothian
can
be
included
among
the
english
of
lothian
who
resisted
edward
i
that
explanation
is
afforded
by
the
events
which
followed
the
norman
conquest
of
england
it
is
argued
that
the
englishmen
who
fled
from
the
normans
united
with
the
original
english
of
lothian
to
produce
the
result
indicated
in
the
passage
quoted
from
green
the
farmers
of
fife
and
the
lowlands
the
artisans
of
the
towns
the
dwellers
in
the
coast
districts
north
of
tay
became
by
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
stout
northumbrian
englishmen
green
admits
that
the
of
scotland
was
still
inhabited
in
by
the
picts
of
galloway
and
neither
he
nor
any
other
exponent
of
the
theory
offers
any
explanation
of
their
subsequent
disappearance
the
history
of
scotland
from
the
fourteenth
century
to
the
rising
of
contains
according
to
this
view
a
struggle
between
the
celts
and
the
english
of
scotland
the
most
important
incident
of
which
is
the
battle
of
harlaw
in
which
resulted
in
a
great
victory
for
the
english
of
scotland
hill
burton
writes
thus
of
harlaw
on
the
face
of
ordinary
history
it
looks
like
an
affair
of
civil
war
but
this
expression
is
properly
used
towards
those
who
have
common
interests
and
sympathies
who
should
naturally
be
friends
and
may
be
friends
again
but
for
a
time
are
from
incidental
causes
of
dispute
and
quarrel
made
enemies
the
contest
was
none
of
this
it
was
a
contest
between
foes
of
whom
their
contemporaries
would
have
said
that
their
ever
being
in
harmony
with
each
other
or
having
a
feeling
of
common
interests
and
common
nationality
was
not
within
the
range
of
rational
expectations
it
will
be
difficult
to
make
those
not
familiar
with
the
tone
of
feeling
in
lowland
scotland
at
that
time
believe
that
the
defeat
of
donald
of
the
isles
was
felt
as
a
more
memorable
deliverance
even
than
that
of
bannockburn
we
venture
to
plead
for
a
modification
of
this
theory
which
may
fairly
be
called
the
orthodox
account
of
the
circumstances
it
will
at
once
occur
to
the
reader
that
some
definite
proof
should
be
forthcoming
that
the
celtic
inhabitants
of
scotland
outside
the
lothians
were
actually
subjected
to
this
process
of
racial
displacement
such
a
displacement
had
certainly
not
been
effected
before
the
norman
conquest
for
it
was
only
in
that
the
english
of
lothian
were
subjected
to
the
rule
of
a
celtic
king
and
the
large
amount
of
scottish
literature
in
the
gaelic
tongue
is
sufficient
indication
that
celtic
scotland
was
not
confined
to
the
highlands
in
the
eleventh
century
nor
have
we
any
hint
of
a
racial
displacement
after
the
norman
conquest
even
though
it
is
unquestionable
that
a
considerable
number
of
exiles
followed
queen
margaret
to
scotland
and
that
william
harrying
of
the
north
of
england
drove
others
over
the
border
it
is
easy
to
lay
too
much
stress
upon
the
effect
of
the
latter
event
the
northern
counties
can
not
have
been
very
thickly
populated
and
if
freeman
is
right
in
his
description
of
that
fearful
deed
half
of
policy
half
of
vengeance
which
has
stamped
the
name
of
william
with
infamy
not
very
many
of
the
victims
of
his
cruelty
can
have
made
good
their
flight
for
we
are
told
that
the
bodies
of
the
inhabitants
of
yorkshire
were
rotting
in
the
streets
in
the
highways
or
on
their
own
hearthstones
stone
dead
left
no
fellow
to
colonize
scotland
we
find
therefore
only
the
results
and
not
the
process
of
this
racial
displacement
these
results
were
the
adoption
of
english
manners
and
the
english
tongue
and
the
growth
of
english
names
and
we
wish
to
suggest
that
they
may
find
an
historical
explanation
which
does
not
involve
the
total
disappearance
of
the
scottish
farmer
from
fife
or
of
the
scottish
artisan
from
aberdeen
before
proceeding
to
a
statement
of
the
explanation
to
which
we
desire
to
direct
the
reader
attention
it
may
be
useful
to
deal
briefly
with
the
questions
relating
to
the
spoken
language
of
lowland
scotland
and
to
its
the
fact
that
the
language
of
the
angles
and
saxons
completely
superseded
in
england
the
tongue
of
the
conquered
britons
is
admitted
to
be
a
powerful
argument
for
the
view
that
the
conquest
of
england
resulted
in
a
racial
displacement
but
the
argument
can
not
be
transferred
to
the
case
of
the
scottish
lowlands
where
also
the
english
language
has
completely
superseded
a
celtic
tongue
for
in
the
first
case
the
victory
is
that
of
the
language
of
a
savage
people
known
to
be
in
a
state
of
actual
warfare
and
it
is
a
victory
which
follows
as
an
immediate
result
of
conquest
in
scotland
the
victory
of
the
english
tongue
outside
the
lothians
dates
from
a
relatively
advanced
period
of
civilization
and
it
is
a
victory
won
not
by
conquest
or
bloodshed
but
by
peaceful
means
even
in
a
case
of
conquest
change
of
speech
is
not
conclusive
evidence
of
change
of
race
the
adoption
of
a
romance
tongue
by
the
gauls
much
less
is
it
decisive
in
such
an
instance
as
the
adoption
of
english
by
the
lowlanders
of
scotland
in
striking
contrast
to
the
case
of
england
the
victory
of
the
speech
in
scotland
did
not
include
the
adoption
of
english
the
reader
will
find
the
subject
fully
discussed
in
the
valuable
work
by
the
reverend
johnston
entitled
of
it
is
impossible
says
johnston
to
speak
with
strict
accuracy
on
the
point
but
celtic
names
in
scotland
must
outnumber
all
the
rest
by
nearly
ten
to
one
even
in
counties
where
the
gaelic
tongue
is
now
quite
obsolete
in
fife
in
forfar
in
the
mearns
and
in
parts
of
aberdeenshire
the
are
almost
entirely
celtic
the
region
where
english
abound
is
of
course
the
lothians
but
scarcely
an
english
is
definitely
known
to
have
existed
even
in
the
lothians
before
the
norman
conquest
and
even
in
the
lothians
the
english
tongue
never
affected
the
names
of
rivers
and
mountains
in
many
instances
the
existence
of
a
which
has
now
assumed
an
english
form
is
no
proof
of
english
race
as
the
gaelic
tongue
died
out
gaelic
were
either
translated
or
corrupted
into
english
forms
englishmen
receiving
grants
of
land
from
malcolm
canmore
and
his
successors
called
these
lands
after
their
own
names
with
the
addition
of
the
the
influence
of
english
ecclesiastics
introduced
many
new
names
and
as
english
commerce
opened
up
new
seaports
some
of
these
became
known
by
the
names
which
englishmen
had
given
them
on
the
whole
the
evidence
of
the
corroborates
our
view
that
the
changes
were
changes
in
civilization
and
not
in
racial
distribution
we
now
proceed
to
indicate
the
method
by
which
these
changes
were
effected
apart
from
any
displacement
of
race
our
explanation
finds
a
parallel
in
the
process
which
has
changed
the
face
of
the
scottish
highlands
within
the
last
hundred
and
fifty
years
and
which
produced
very
important
results
within
the
sixty
years
to
which
sir
walter
scott
referred
in
the
second
title
of
there
has
been
no
racial
displacement
but
the
english
language
and
english
civilization
have
gradually
been
superseding
the
ancient
tongue
and
the
ancient
customs
of
the
scottish
highlands
the
difference
between
skye
and
fife
is
that
the
influences
which
have
been
at
work
in
the
former
for
a
century
and
a
half
have
been
in
operation
in
the
latter
for
more
than
eight
hundred
years
what
then
were
the
influences
which
between
and
produced
in
the
scottish
lowlands
some
of
the
results
that
between
and
were
achieved
in
the
scottish
highlands
that
they
included
an
infusion
of
english
blood
we
have
no
wish
to
deny
in
considerable
numbers
penetrated
northwards
and
by
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
lowlanders
were
a
much
less
pure
race
than
except
in
the
lothians
they
had
been
in
the
days
of
malcolm
canmore
our
contention
is
that
we
have
no
evidence
for
the
assertion
that
this
saxon
admixture
amounted
to
a
racial
change
and
that
ethnically
the
men
of
fife
and
of
forfar
were
still
scots
not
english
such
an
infusion
of
english
blood
as
our
argument
allows
will
not
explain
the
adoption
of
the
english
tongue
or
of
english
habits
of
life
we
must
look
elsewhere
for
the
full
explanation
the
english
victory
was
as
we
shall
try
to
show
a
victory
not
of
blood
but
of
civilization
and
three
main
causes
helped
to
bring
it
about
the
marriage
of
malcolm
canmore
introduced
two
new
influences
into
scotland
an
english
court
and
an
english
church
and
contemporaneously
with
the
changes
consequent
upon
these
new
institutions
came
the
spread
of
english
commerce
carrying
with
it
the
english
tongue
along
the
coast
and
bringing
an
infusion
of
english
blood
into
the
towns
in
the
reign
of
david
i
the
son
of
malcolm
canmore
and
margaret
these
purely
saxon
influences
were
succeeded
by
the
tendencies
of
the
king
favourites
grants
of
land
to
english
and
norman
courtiers
account
for
the
occurrence
of
english
and
norman
family
and
the
men
who
lived
in
immediate
dependence
upon
a
lord
giving
him
their
services
and
receiving
his
protection
owing
him
their
homage
and
living
under
his
sole
jurisdiction
took
the
name
of
the
lord
whose
men
they
were
a
more
important
question
arises
with
regard
to
the
system
of
land
tenure
and
the
change
from
clan
ownership
to
feudal
possession
how
was
the
tribal
system
suppressed
an
outline
of
the
process
by
which
scotland
became
a
feudalized
country
will
be
found
in
the
appendix
where
we
shall
also
have
an
opportunity
of
referring
for
purposes
of
comparison
to
the
methods
by
which
was
destroyed
after
the
last
jacobite
insurrection
here
it
must
suffice
to
give
a
brief
summary
of
the
case
there
presented
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
tribes
of
were
not
the
clans
of
the
clan
system
in
the
highlands
underwent
considerable
development
between
the
days
of
malcolm
canmore
and
those
of
the
stuarts
too
much
stress
must
not
be
laid
upon
the
unwillingness
of
the
people
to
give
up
tribal
ownership
for
it
is
clear
from
our
early
records
that
the
rights
of
were
confined
to
the
immediate
kin
of
the
head
of
the
clan
the
limit
of
the
immediate
kindred
says
robertson
extended
to
the
third
generation
all
who
were
fourth
in
descent
from
a
senior
passing
from
amongst
the
and
receiving
apparently
a
final
allotment
which
seems
to
have
been
separated
permanently
from
the
remainder
of
the
by
certain
ceremonies
usual
on
such
occasions
to
such
holders
of
individual
property
the
charter
offered
by
david
i
gave
additional
security
of
tenure
we
know
from
the
documents
entitled
quoniam
attachiamenta
printed
in
the
first
volume
of
the
of
the
parliament
of
that
the
tribal
system
included
large
numbers
of
bondmen
to
whom
the
change
to
feudalism
meant
little
or
nothing
but
even
when
all
due
allowance
has
been
made
for
this
the
difficulty
is
not
completely
solved
there
must
have
been
some
owners
of
clan
property
whom
the
changes
affected
in
an
adverse
way
and
we
should
expect
to
hear
of
them
we
do
hear
of
them
for
the
reigns
of
the
successors
of
malcolm
canmore
are
largely
occupied
with
revolts
in
galloway
and
in
morayshire
the
most
notable
of
these
was
the
rebellion
of
macheth
mormaor
of
moray
about
on
its
suppression
david
i
confiscated
the
earldom
of
moray
and
granted
it
by
charters
to
his
own
favourites
and
especially
to
the
from
yorkshire
and
northumberland
whom
he
had
invited
to
aid
him
in
dealing
with
the
reactionary
forces
of
moray
but
such
grants
of
land
in
no
way
dispossessed
the
lesser
tenants
who
simply
held
of
new
lords
and
by
new
titles
fordun
who
wrote
two
centuries
later
ascribes
to
david
successor
malcolm
iv
an
invasion
of
moray
and
says
that
the
king
scattered
the
inhabitants
throughout
the
rest
of
scotland
and
replaced
them
by
his
own
peaceful
people
there
is
no
further
evidence
in
support
of
this
statement
and
almost
the
whole
of
malcolm
short
reign
was
occupied
with
the
settlement
of
galloway
we
know
that
he
followed
his
policy
of
making
grants
of
land
in
moray
and
this
is
probably
the
germ
of
truth
in
fordun
statement
moray
however
occupied
rather
an
exceptional
position
as
the
power
of
the
sovereign
extended
over
the
west
says
robertson
it
was
his
policy
not
to
eradicate
the
old
ruling
families
but
to
retain
them
in
their
native
provinces
rendering
them
more
or
less
responsible
for
all
that
portion
of
their
respective
districts
which
was
not
placed
under
the
immediate
authority
of
the
royal
sheriffs
or
baillies
as
this
policy
was
carried
out
even
in
galloway
argyll
and
ross
where
there
were
occasional
rebellions
and
was
successful
in
its
results
we
have
no
reason
for
believing
that
it
was
abandoned
in
dealing
with
the
rest
of
the
lowlands
as
from
time
to
time
instances
occurred
in
which
this
plan
was
unsuccessful
and
as
other
causes
for
forfeiture
arose
the
lands
were
granted
to
strangers
and
by
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
scottish
nobility
was
largely
the
vestiges
of
the
clan
system
which
remained
may
be
part
of
the
explanation
of
the
place
of
the
great
houses
in
scottish
history
the
unique
importance
of
such
families
as
the
douglasses
or
the
gordons
may
thus
be
a
portion
of
the
celtic
heritage
of
the
lowlands
if
then
it
was
not
by
a
displacement
of
race
but
through
the
subtle
influences
of
religion
feudalism
and
commerce
that
the
scottish
lowlands
came
to
be
english
in
speech
and
in
civilization
if
the
farmers
of
fife
and
some
at
least
of
the
burghers
of
dundee
or
of
aberdeen
were
really
scots
who
had
been
subjected
to
english
influences
we
should
expect
to
find
no
strong
racial
feeling
in
mediæval
scotland
such
racial
antagonism
as
existed
would
in
this
case
be
owing
to
the
large
admixture
of
scandinavian
blood
in
caithness
and
in
the
isles
rather
than
to
any
difference
between
the
true
scots
and
the
english
of
the
lowlands
do
we
then
find
any
racial
antagonism
between
the
highlands
and
the
lowlands
if
freeman
is
right
in
laying
down
the
general
rule
that
the
true
scots
out
of
hatred
to
the
nearest
to
them
leagued
with
the
farther
off
if
hill
burton
is
correct
in
describing
the
red
harlaw
as
a
battle
between
foes
who
could
have
no
feeling
of
common
nationality
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
in
support
of
the
theory
we
have
ventured
to
suggest
we
may
fairly
expect
some
signs
of
between
those
who
maintained
the
celtic
civilization
and
their
brethren
who
had
abandoned
the
ancient
customs
and
the
ancient
tongue
we
may
naturally
look
for
attempts
to
produce
a
conservative
or
celtic
reaction
but
anything
more
than
this
will
be
fatal
to
our
case
the
facts
do
not
seem
to
us
to
bear
out
generalization
when
the
independence
of
scotland
is
really
at
stake
we
shall
find
the
true
scots
on
the
patriotic
side
highlanders
and
islesmen
fought
under
the
banner
of
david
i
at
northallerton
they
took
their
place
along
with
the
men
of
carrick
in
the
bruce
own
division
at
bannockburn
and
they
bore
their
part
in
the
stubborn
ring
that
encircled
james
iv
at
flodden
at
other
times
indeed
we
do
find
the
lords
of
the
isles
involved
in
treacherous
intrigues
with
the
kings
of
england
but
just
in
the
same
way
as
we
see
the
earls
of
douglas
engaged
in
traitorous
schemes
against
the
scottish
kings
in
both
cases
alike
we
are
dealing
with
the
revolt
of
a
powerful
vassal
against
a
weak
king
such
an
incident
is
sufficiently
frequent
in
the
annals
of
scotland
to
render
it
unnecessary
to
call
in
racial
considerations
to
afford
an
explanation
one
of
the
most
notable
of
these
intrigues
occurred
in
the
year
when
donald
of
the
isles
who
chanced
to
be
engaged
in
a
personal
quarrel
about
the
heritage
which
he
claimed
in
right
of
his
lowland
relatives
made
a
treacherous
agreement
with
henry
iv
and
the
quarrel
ended
in
the
battle
of
harlaw
in
the
real
importance
of
harlaw
is
that
it
ended
in
the
defeat
of
a
scotsman
who
like
some
other
scotsmen
in
the
south
was
acting
in
the
english
interest
any
further
significance
that
it
may
possess
arises
from
the
consideration
that
it
is
the
last
of
a
series
of
efforts
directed
against
the
predominance
not
of
the
english
race
but
of
saxon
speech
and
civilization
it
was
just
because
highlanders
and
lowlanders
did
represent
a
common
nationality
that
the
battle
was
fought
and
the
blood
spilt
on
the
field
of
harlaw
was
not
shed
in
any
racial
struggle
but
in
the
cause
of
the
real
english
conquest
of
scotland
the
conquest
of
civilization
and
of
speech
our
argument
derives
considerable
support
from
the
references
to
the
highlands
of
scotland
which
we
find
in
mediæval
literature
racial
distinctions
were
not
always
understood
in
the
middle
ages
but
readers
of
giraldus
cambrensis
are
familiar
with
the
strong
racial
feeling
that
existed
between
the
english
and
the
welsh
and
between
the
english
and
the
irish
if
the
lowlanders
of
scotland
felt
towards
the
highlanders
as
hill
burton
asserts
that
they
did
feel
we
should
expect
to
find
references
to
the
difference
between
celts
and
saxons
but
on
the
contrary
we
meet
with
statement
after
statement
to
the
effect
that
the
highlanders
are
only
scotsmen
who
have
maintained
the
ancient
scottish
language
and
literature
while
the
lowlanders
have
adopted
english
customs
and
a
foreign
tongue
the
words
scots
and
scotland
are
never
used
to
designate
the
highlanders
as
distinct
from
other
inhabitants
of
scotland
yet
the
phrase
lingua
scotica
means
up
to
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
gaelic
tongue
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
john
major
speaks
of
the
wild
scots
and
islanders
as
using
irish
while
the
civilized
scots
speak
english
and
gavin
douglas
professed
to
write
in
scots
the
lowland
tongue
in
the
course
of
the
century
this
became
the
regular
usage
acts
of
the
scottish
parliament
directed
against
highland
marauders
class
them
with
the
border
thieves
there
is
no
hint
in
the
register
of
the
privy
council
or
in
the
exchequer
rolls
of
any
racial
feeling
and
the
independence
of
the
celtic
chiefs
has
been
considerably
exaggerated
james
iv
and
james
v
both
visited
the
isles
and
the
chief
town
of
skye
takes
its
name
from
the
visit
of
the
latter
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
it
was
safe
for
hector
boece
the
principal
of
the
newly
founded
university
of
aberdeen
to
go
in
company
of
the
rector
to
make
a
voyage
to
the
hebrides
and
in
the
account
they
have
left
us
of
their
experiences
we
can
discover
no
hint
that
there
existed
between
highlanders
and
lowlanders
much
the
same
difference
as
separated
the
english
from
the
welsh
neither
in
barbour
nor
in
blind
harry
is
there
any
such
consciousness
of
difference
although
barbour
lived
in
aberdeen
in
the
days
before
harlaw
john
of
fordun
a
and
a
contemporary
of
barbour
was
an
ardent
admirer
of
margaret
and
of
david
i
and
of
the
institutions
they
introduced
while
he
possessed
an
invincible
objection
to
the
kilt
we
should
therefore
expect
to
find
in
him
some
consciousness
of
the
racial
difference
he
writes
of
the
highlanders
with
some
describing
them
as
a
savage
and
untamed
people
rude
and
independent
given
to
rapine
hostile
to
the
english
language
and
people
and
owing
to
diversity
of
speech
even
to
their
own
nation
but
it
is
his
custom
to
write
thus
of
the
opponents
of
the
civil
and
ecclesiastical
institutions
and
he
brings
all
scotland
under
the
same
condemnation
when
he
tells
us
how
david
did
his
utmost
to
draw
on
that
rough
and
boorish
people
towards
quiet
and
chastened
manners
the
reference
to
their
own
nation
shows
too
that
fordun
did
not
understand
that
the
highlanders
were
a
different
people
and
when
he
called
them
hostile
to
the
english
he
was
evidently
unaware
that
their
custom
was
out
of
hatred
to
the
saxons
nearest
them
to
league
with
the
english
john
major
writing
in
the
reign
of
james
iv
mentions
the
differences
between
highlander
and
lowlander
the
wild
scots
speak
irish
the
civilized
scots
use
english
but
he
adds
most
of
us
spoke
irish
a
short
time
ago
his
contemporary
hector
boece
who
made
the
tour
to
the
hebrides
says
those
of
us
who
live
on
the
borders
of
england
have
forsaken
our
own
tongue
and
learned
english
being
driven
thereto
by
wars
and
commerce
but
the
highlanders
remain
just
as
they
were
in
the
time
of
malcolm
canmore
in
whose
days
we
began
to
adopt
english
manners
when
bishop
elphinstone
applied
in
for
papal
permission
to
found
a
university
in
old
aberdeen
in
proximity
to
the
barbarian
highlanders
he
made
no
suggestion
of
any
racial
difference
between
the
population
of
aberdeen
and
their
neighbours
late
in
the
sixteenth
century
john
lesley
the
defender
of
queen
mary
who
had
been
bishop
of
ross
and
came
of
a
northern
family
wrote
in
a
strain
similar
to
that
of
major
and
boece
foreign
nations
look
on
the
scots
as
wild
barbarians
because
they
maintain
the
customs
and
the
language
of
their
ancestors
but
we
call
them
highlanders
even
in
connexion
with
the
battle
of
harlaw
we
find
that
scottish
historians
do
not
use
such
terms
in
speaking
of
the
highland
forces
as
hill
burton
would
lead
us
to
expect
of
the
two
contemporary
authorities
one
the
book
of
pluscarden
was
probably
written
by
a
highlander
while
the
continuation
of
fordun
in
which
we
have
a
more
detailed
account
of
the
battle
was
the
work
of
bower
a
lowlander
who
shared
fordun
antipathy
to
highland
customs
the
mentions
the
battle
in
a
very
casual
manner
it
was
fought
between
donald
of
the
isles
and
the
earl
of
mar
there
was
great
slaughter
and
it
so
happened
that
the
town
of
cupar
chanced
to
be
burned
in
the
same
year
bower
assigns
a
greater
importance
to
the
affair
he
tells
us
that
donald
wished
to
spoil
aberdeen
and
then
to
add
to
his
own
possessions
all
scotland
up
to
the
tay
it
is
as
if
he
were
writing
of
the
ambition
of
the
house
of
douglas
but
there
is
no
hint
of
racial
antipathy
the
abuse
applied
to
donald
and
his
followers
would
suit
equally
well
for
the
borderers
who
shouted
the
douglas
john
major
tells
us
that
it
was
a
civil
war
fought
for
the
spoil
of
the
famous
city
of
aberdeen
and
he
can
not
say
who
won
only
the
islanders
lost
more
men
than
the
civilized
scots
for
him
its
chief
interest
lay
in
the
ferocity
of
the
contest
rarely
even
in
struggles
with
a
foreign
foe
had
the
fighting
been
so
keen
the
fierceness
with
which
harlaw
was
fought
impressed
the
country
so
much
that
some
sixty
years
later
when
major
was
a
boy
he
and
his
playmates
at
the
grammar
school
of
haddington
used
to
amuse
themselves
by
mock
fights
in
which
they
the
red
harlaw
from
major
we
turn
with
interest
to
the
principal
of
the
university
and
king
college
hector
boece
who
wrote
his
of
at
aberdeen
about
a
century
after
the
battle
of
harlaw
and
who
shows
no
trace
of
the
strong
feeling
described
by
hill
burton
he
narrates
the
origin
of
the
quarrel
with
much
sympathy
for
the
lord
of
the
isles
and
regrets
that
he
was
not
satisfied
with
recovering
his
own
heritage
of
ross
but
was
tempted
by
the
pillage
of
aberdeen
and
he
speaks
of
the
lowland
army
as
the
scots
on
the
other
side
his
narrative
in
the
is
devoid
of
any
racial
feeling
whatsoever
and
in
his
of
the
bishops
of
he
omits
any
mention
of
harlaw
at
all
we
have
laid
stress
upon
the
evidence
of
boece
because
in
aberdeen
if
anywhere
the
memory
of
the
celtic
peril
at
harlaw
should
have
survived
similarly
george
buchanan
speaks
of
harlaw
as
a
raid
for
purposes
of
plunder
made
by
the
islanders
upon
the
mainland
these
illustrations
may
serve
to
show
how
scottish
historians
really
did
look
upon
the
battle
of
harlaw
and
how
little
do
they
share
horror
of
the
celts
when
we
turn
to
descriptions
of
scotland
we
find
no
further
proof
of
the
correctness
of
the
orthodox
theory
when
giraldus
cambrensis
wrote
in
the
twelfth
century
he
remarked
that
the
scots
of
his
time
have
an
affinity
of
race
with
the
irish
and
the
english
historians
of
the
war
of
independence
speak
of
the
scots
as
they
do
of
the
welsh
or
the
irish
and
they
know
only
one
type
of
scotsman
we
have
already
seen
the
opinion
of
john
major
the
scottish
historian
and
theologian
who
had
lived
much
in
france
and
could
write
of
his
native
country
from
an
that
the
highlanders
speak
irish
and
are
less
respectable
than
the
other
scots
and
his
opinion
was
shared
by
two
foreign
observers
pedro
de
ayala
and
polydore
vergil
the
former
remarks
on
the
difference
of
speech
and
the
latter
says
that
the
more
civilized
scots
have
adopted
the
english
tongue
in
like
manner
english
writers
about
the
time
of
the
union
of
the
crowns
write
of
the
highlanders
as
scotsmen
who
retain
their
ancient
language
camden
indeed
speaks
of
the
lowlands
as
being
in
origin
but
he
restricts
his
remark
to
the
district
which
had
formed
part
of
the
kingdom
of
northumbria
we
should
of
course
expect
to
find
that
the
gradually
widening
breach
in
manners
and
language
between
highlanders
and
lowlanders
produced
some
dislike
for
the
highland
robbers
and
their
irish
tongue
and
we
do
occasionally
though
rarely
meet
some
indication
of
this
there
are
not
many
references
to
the
highlanders
in
scottish
literature
earlier
than
the
sixteenth
century
blind
harry
book
vi
ll
represents
an
english
soldier
as
using
in
addressing
wallace

a
mixture
of

and

phrase
seems
to
have
some
ironical
signification
for
we
find
in

that
it
was
used
by

as
a
term
of
abuse
towards
the

vi
the
lowland
literature
of
the
sixteenth
century
contains
a
considerable
amount
of
abuse
of
the
highland
tongue
william
dunbar
in
his
flyting
an
exercise
in
invective
reproaches
his
antagonist
walter
kennedy
with
his
highland
origin
kennedy
was
a
native
of
galloway
while
dunbar
belonged
to
the
lothians
where
we
should
expect
the
strongest
appreciation
of
the
differences
between
lowlander
and
highlander
dunbar
moreover
had
studied
or
at
least
resided
at
oxford
and
was
one
of
the
first
scotsmen
to
succumb
to
the
attractions
of
town
the
most
suggestive
point
in
the
flyting
is
that
a
native
of
the
lothians
could
still
regard
a
galwegian
as
a
beggar
irish
bard
for
walter
kennedy
spoke
and
wrote
in
lowland
scots
he
was
possibly
a
graduate
of
the
university
of
glasgow
and
he
could
boast
of
stuart
blood
ayrshire
was
as
really
english
as
was
aberdeenshire
and
if
dunbar
is
in
earnest
it
is
a
strong
confirmation
of
our
theory
that
he
being
of
the
lothians
himself
spoke
of
kennedy
in
this
way
it
would
however
be
unwise
to
lay
too
much
stress
on
what
was
really
a
conventional
exercise
of
a
particular
style
of
poetry
now
obsolete
kennedy
in
his
reply
retorts
that
he
alone
is
true
scots
and
that
dunbar
as
a
native
of
lothian
is

for
a
theory
of

antagonism
after
the

the
lowlands
of
scotland
came
to
be
more
and
more
closely
bound
to
england
while
the

remained
unaffected
by
these
changes
the
scottish
nobility
began
to
find
its

the
history
of

century
prepared
the
way
for
the
acceptance
of
the
celtic
theory
in
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
and
when
philologists
asserted
that
the
scottish
highlanders
were
a
different
race
from
the
scottish
lowlanders
the
suggestion
was
eagerly
adopted
the
views
of
the
philologists
were
confirmed
by
the
experiences
of
the
and
they
received
a
literary
form
in
the
of
the
and
in
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
theory
received
further
development
owing
to
the
fact
that
it
was
generally
in
line
with
the
arguments
of
the
defenders
of
the
edwardian
policy
in
scotland
and
it
can
not
be
denied
that
it
holds
the
field
in
spite
of
robertson
attack
on
it
in

writer
of

volume
ventures
to
hope
that
he
has
at
all

done
something
to
make
out
a
case
for
of
the
subject
the
political
facts
on
which
rests
the
argument
just
stated
will
be
found
in
the
text
and
an
appendix
contains
the
more
important
references
to
the
highlanders
in
mediæval
scottish
literature
and
offers
a
brief
account
of
the
feudalization
of
scotland
our
argument
amounts
only
to
a
modification
and
not
to
a
complete
reversal
of
the
current
theory
no
historical
problems
are
more
difficult
than
those
which
refer
to
racial
distribution
and
it
is
impossible
to
speak
dogmatically
on
such
a
subject
that
the
english
blood
of
the
lothians
and
the
english
exiles
after
the
norman
conquest
did
modify
the
race
over
whom
malcolm
canmore
ruled
we
do
not
seek
to
deny
but
that
it
was
a
modification
and
not
a
displacement
a
victory
of
civilization
and
not
of
race
we
beg
to
suggest
the
english
influences
were
none
the
less
strong
for
this
and
in
the
end
they
have
everywhere
prevailed
but
the
scotsman
may
like
to
think
that
mediæval
scotland
was
not
divided
by
an
abrupt
racial
line
and
that
the
political
unity
and
independence
which
it
obtained
at
so
great
a
cost
did
correspond
to
a
natural
and

racial
distribution
and
feudal
relations
since
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
has
been
customary
to
speak
of
the
scottish
highlanders
as
celts
the
name
is
singularly
inappropriate
the
word
celt
was
used
by
cæsar
to
describe
the
peoples
of
middle
gaul
and
it
thence
became
almost
synonymous
with
gallic
the
ancient
inhabitants
of
gaul
were
far
from
being
closely
akin
to
the
ancient
inhabitants
of
scotland
although
they
belong
to
the
same
general
family
the
latter
were
picts
and
goidels
the
former
brythons
or
britons
of
the
same
race
as
those
who
settled
in
england
and
were
driven
by
the
saxon
conquerors
into
wales
as
their
kinsmen
were
driven
into
brittany
by
successive
conquests
of
gaul
in
the
south
of
scotland
goidels
and
brythons
must
at
one
period
have
met
but
the
result
of
the
meeting
was
to
drive
the
goidels
into
the
highlands
where
the
goidelic
or
gaelic
form
of
speech
still
remains
different
from
the
welsh
of
the
descendants
of
the
britons
thus
the
only
reason
for
calling
the
scottish
highlanders
celts
is
that
cæsar
used
that
name
to
describe
a
race
cognate
with
another
race
from
which
the
highlanders
ought
to
be
carefully
distinguished
in
none
of
our
ancient
records
is
the
term
celt
ever
employed
to
describe
the
highlanders
of
scotland
they
never
called
themselves
celtic
their
neighbours
never
gave
them
such
a
name
nor
would
the
term
have
possessed
any
significance
as
applied
to
them
before
the
eighteenth
century
in
a
french
historian
and
biblical
antiquary
paul
yves
pezron
wrote
a
book
about
the
people
of
brittany
entitled
de
la
nation
et
de
la
langue
des
celtes
autrement
appellez
it
was
translated
into
english
almost
immediately
and
philologists
soon
discovered
that
the
language
of
cæsar
celts
was
related
to
the
gaelic
of
the
scottish
highlanders
on
this
ground
progressed
the
extension
of
the
name
and
the
highlanders
became
identified
with
instead
of
being
distinguished
from
the
celts
of
gaul
the
word
celt
was
used
to
describe
both
the
whole
family
including
brythons
and
goidels
and
also
the
special
branch
of
the
family
to
which
cæsar
applied
the
term
it
is
as
if
the
word
teutonic
had
been
used
to
describe
the
whole
aryan
family
and
had
been
specially
employed
in
speaking
of
the
romance
peoples
the
word
celtic
has
however
become
a
technical
term
as
opposed
to
saxon
or
english
and
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
its
use
besides
the
goidels
or
celts
and
the
brythonic
celts
or
britons
we
find
traces
in
scotland
of
an
earlier
race
who
are
known
as
picts
a
few
fragments
of
whose
language
survive
about
the
identity
of
these
picts
another
controversy
has
been
waged
some
look
upon
the
pictish
tongue
as
closely
allied
to
scottish
gaelic
others
regard
it
as
brythonic
rather
than
goidelic
and
rhys
surmises
that
it
is
really
an
older
form
of
speech
neither
goidelic
nor
brythonic
and
probably
not
allied
to
either
although
in
the
form
in
which
its
fragments
have
come
down
to
us
it
has
been
deeply
affected
by
brythonic
forms
be
all
this
as
it
may
it
is
important
for
us
to
remember
that
at
the
dawn
of
history
modern
scotland
was
populated
entirely
by
people
now
known
as
celts
of
whom
the
brythonic
portion
were
the
later
to
appear
driving
the
goidels
into
the
more
mountainous
districts
the
picts
whatever
their
origin
had
become
practically
amalgamated
with
the
celts
and
the
roman
historians
do
not
distinguish
between
different
kinds
of
northern
barbarians
in
the
end
of
the
fifth
century
and
the
beginning
of
the
sixth
a
new
settlement
of
goidels
was
made
these
were
the
scots
who
founded
the
kingdom
of
dalriada
corresponding
roughly
to
the
modern
argyllshire
some
fifty
years
later
came
the
angles
under
ida
and
established
a
dominion
along
the
coast
from
tweed
to
forth
covering
the
modern
counties
of
roxburgh
berwick
haddington
and
midlothian
its
outlying
fort
was
the
castle
of
edinburgh
the
name
of
which
in
the
form
in
which
we
have
it
has
certainly
been
influenced
by
association
with
the
northumbrian
king
edwin
this
district
remained
a
portion
of
the
kingdom
of
northumbria
till
the
tenth
century
and
it
is
of
this
district
alone
that
the
word
english
can
fairly
be
used
even
here
however
there
must
have
been
a
considerable
infusion
of
celtic
blood
and
such
celtic
as
dunbar
still
remain
even
in
the
counties
where
english
predominate
a
distinguished
celtic
scholar
tells
us
in
all
our
ancient
literature
the
inhabitants
of
ancient
lothian
are
known
as
because
they
were
a
cymric
people
governed
by
the
saxons
of
northumbria
a
further
influence
was
that
of
the
norse
invaders
who
attacked
the
country
from
the
ninth
to
the
eighteenth
century
and
profoundly
modified
the
racial
character
of
the
population
on
the
south
and
west
coasts
in
the
islands
and
along
the
east
coast
as
far
south
as
the
moray
firth
such
then
was
the
racial
distribution
of
scotland
picts
goidelic
celts
brythonic
celts
scots
and
were
in
possession
of
the
country
in
the
year
kenneth
macalpine
king
of
the
scots
of
dalriada
united
under
his
rule
the
ancient
kingdoms
of
the
picts
and
scots
including
the
whole
of
scotland
from
the
pentland
firth
to
the
forth
in
a
brother
of
the
king
of
scots
became
king
of
the
britons
of
strathclyde
while
lothian
with
the
rest
of
northumbria
passed
under
the
overlordship
of
the
house
of
wessex
we
have
now
arrived
at
the
commencement
of
the
long
dispute
about
the
overlordship
we
shall
attempt
to
state
the
main
outlines
as
clearly
as
possible
the
foundation
of
the
whole
controversy
lies
in
a
statement
in
the
honest
english
of
the
winchester
chronicle
that
in
was
eadward
king
chosen
to
father
and
to
lord
of
the
scots
king
and
of
the
scots
and
of
regnold
king
and
of
all
the
northumbrians
and
also
of
the
strathclyde
brythons
or
welsh
robertson
has
argued
that
no
real
weight
can
be
given
to
this
statement
for
regnold
king
had
died
in
in
edward
the
elder
was
striving
to
suppress
the
danes
south
of
the
humber
and
had
no
claims
to
overlordship
of
any
kind
over
the
northumbrian
danes
and
english
and
the
place
assigned
bakewell
in
derbyshire
is
improbable
and
the
recorded
building
of
a
fort
there
is
irrelevant
the
reassertion
of
this
homage
under
aethelstan
in
which
occurs
in
one
of
the
chronicle
is
open
to
the
objection
that
it
describes
the
king
of
scots
as
giving
up
idolatry
more
than
three
hundred
and
fifty
years
after
the
conversion
of
the
country
but
as
the
entry
under
the
year
is
probably
in
a
contemporary
hand
considerable
weight
must
be
attached
to
the
double
statement
in
the
reign
of
edmund
the
magnificent
an
event
occurred
which
has
given
fresh
occasion
for
dispute
a
famous
passage
in
the
chronicle
tells
how
edmund
and
malcolm
i
of
scotland
conquered
cumbria
which
the
english
king
gave
to
malcolm
on
condition
that
malcolm
should
be
his
midwyrtha
or
by
sea
and
land
freeman
interpreted
this
as
a
feudal
grant
reading
the
sense
of
fealty
into
midwyrtha
and
regarded
the
district
described
as
cumbria
as
including
the
whole
of
strathclyde
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
justify
this
position
especially
as
we
have
no
reason
for
supposing
that
edmund
did
invade
strathclyde
and
since
in
point
of
fact
strathclyde
remained
hostile
to
the
kingdom
of
scotland
long
after
this
date
in
the
statement
of
the
chronicle
is
reasserted
in
connection
with
the
accession
of
eadred
and
in
somewhat
stronger
words
the
scots
gave
him
oaths
that
they
would
all
that
he
would
such
are
the
main
facts
relating
to
the
first
two
divisions
of
the
threefold
claim
to
overlordship
and
their
value
will
probably
continue
to
be
estimated
in
accordance
with
the
personal
feelings
of
the
reader
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
claim
that
they
are
in
any
way
decisive
nor
can
any
further
light
be
gained
from
the
story
of
what
lang
has
happily
termed
the
apocryphal
eight
which
the
king
of
scots
stroked
on
the
dee
in
the
reign
of
edgar
in
connection
with
this
great
commendation
of
the
chronicle
mentions
only
six
kings
as
rowing
edgar
at
chester
and
it
wisely
names
no
names
the
number
eight
and
the
mention
of
kenneth
king
of
scots
as
one
of
the
oarsmen
have
been
transferred
to
freeman
pages
from
those
of
the
chronicler
florence
of
worcester
we
pass
now
to
the
third
section
of
the
supremacy
argument
the
district
to
which
we
have
referred
as
lothian
was
unquestionably
largely
inhabited
by
men
of
english
race
and
it
formed
part
of
the
northumbrian
kingdom
within
the
first
quarter
of
the
eleventh
century
it
had
passed
under
the
dominion
of
the
celtic
kings
of
scotland
when
and
how
this
happened
is
a
mystery
the
tract
northynbrorum
which
used
to
be
attributed
to
simeon
of
durham
asserts
that
it
was
ceded
by
edgar
to
kenneth
and
that
kenneth
did
homage
and
this
story
elaborated
by
john
of
wallingford
has
been
frequently
given
as
the
historical
explanation
but
simeon
of
durham
in
his
history
asserts
that
malcolm
ii
about
wrested
lothian
from
the
earl
of
northumbria
and
there
is
internal
evidence
that
the
story
of
edgar
and
kenneth
has
been
constructed
out
of
the
known
facts
of
malcolm
reign
it
is
at
all
events
certain
that
the
scottish
kings
in
no
sense
governed
lothian
till
after
the
battle
of
carham
in
when
malcolm
and
the
strathclyde
monarch
owen
defeated
the
earl
of
northumbria
and
added
lothian
to
his
dominions
this
conquest
was
confirmed
by
canute
in
and
in
connection
with
the
confirmation
the
chronicle
again
speaks
of
a
doubtful
homage
which
the
scots
king
not
long
held
and
again
the
chronicle
or
one
version
of
it
adds
an
impossible
statement
this
time
about
macbeth
who
had
not
yet
appeared
on
the
stage
of
history
the
year
is
also
marked
by
the
succession
of
malcolm
grandson
duncan
to
the
throne
of
his
kinsman
owen
of
strathclyde
and
on
malcolm
death
in
the
whole
of
scotland
was
nominally
united
under
duncan
i
the
consolidation
of
the
kingdom
was
as
yet
in
the
future
but
from
the
end
of
the
reign
of
malcolm
ii
there
was
but
one
kingdom
of
scotland
from
this
united
kingdom
we
must
exclude
the
islands
which
were
largely
inhabited
by
norsemen
both
the
hebrides
and
the
islands
of
orkney
and
shetland
were
outside
the
realm
of
scotland
the
names
of
macbeth
and
the
gentle
duncan
suggest
the
great
drama
which
the
genius
of
shakespeare
constructed
from
the
magic
tale
of
hector
boece
but
our
path
does
not
lie
by
the
moor
near
forres
nor
past
birnam
wood
or
dunsinane
nor
does
the
historian
of
the
relations
between
england
and
scotland
have
anything
to
tell
about
the
english
expedition
to
restore
malcolm
all
such
tales
emanate
from
florence
of
worcester
and
we
know
only
that
siward
of
northumbria
made
a
fruitless
invasion
of
scotland
and
that
macbeth
reigned
for
three
years
afterwards
we
have
now
traced
in
outline
the
connections
between
the
northern
and
the
southern
portions
of
this
island
up
to
the
date
of
the
norman
conquest
of
england
we
have
found
in
scotland
a
population
composed
of
pict
scot
goidel
brython
dane
and
angle
and
we
have
seen
how
the
country
came
to
be
in
some
sense
united
under
a
single
monarch
it
is
not
possible
to
speak
dogmatically
of
either
of
the
two
great
problems
of
the
period
the
racial
distribution
of
the
country
and
the
edwardian
claims
to
overlordship
but
it
is
clear
that
no
portion
of
scotland
was
in
in
any
sense
english
except
the
lothians
of
which
angles
and
danes
had
taken
possession
from
the
lothians
the
english
influences
must
have
spread
slightly
into
strathclyde
but
the
fact
that
the
celtic
kings
of
scotland
were
strong
enough
to
annex
and
rule
the
lothians
as
part
of
a
celtic
kingdom
implies
a
limit
to
english
colonization
as
to
the
feudal
supremacy
it
may
be
fairly
said
that
there
is
no
portion
of
the
english
claim
that
can
not
be
reasonably
doubted
and
whatever
force
it
retains
must
be
of
the
nature
of
a
cumulative
argument
it
must
of
course
be
recollected
that
chroniclers
of
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
like
english
historians
of
a
later
date
regarded
themselves
as
holding
a
brief
for
the
english
claim
while
on
the
other
hand
scottish
writers
would
be
the
last
to
assert
in
their
own
case
a
complete
absence
of
bias

the

conquest

could
not
fail
to
modify
the
position
of
scotland
just
as
the
roman
and
the
saxon
conquests
had
in
turn
driven
the
brythons
northwards
so
the
dispossessed
saxons
fled
to
scotland
from
their
norman
victors
the
result
was
considerably
to
alter
the
ecclesiastical
arrangements
of
the
country
and
to
help
its
advance
towards
civilization
the
proportion
of
to
the
races
who
are
known
as
celts
must
also
have
been
increased
but
a
complete
of
southern
scotland
could
not
and
did
not
follow
the
failure
of
william
conquest
to
include
the
northern
counties
of
england
left
northumbria
an
easy
prey

the
scottish
king
and

of

known
as
canmore
to
margaret
the
sister
of
edgar
the
ætheling
gave
her
husband
an
excuse
for
interference
in
england
we
accordingly
find
a
long
series
of
raids
over
the
border
of
which
only
five
possess
any
importance
in
malcolm
who
had
even
in
the
confessor
time
been
in
northumberland
with
hostile
intent
conducted
an
invasion
in
the
interests
of
his
it
is
probable
that
this
movement
was
intended
to
coincide
with
the
arrival
of
the
danish
fleet
a
few
months
earlier
but
malcolm
was
too
late
the
danes
had
gone
home
and
in
the
interval
william
had
himself
superintended
the
great
harrying
of
the
north
which
made
subsequent
efforts
somewhat
unnecessary
the
invasion
is
important
only
as
having
provoked
the
of
the
conqueror
which
led
to
the
renewal
of
the
supremacy
controversy
william
marched
into
scotland
and
crossed
the
forth
the
first
english
king
to
do
so
since
the
unfortunate
egfrith
who
fell
at
nectansmere
in
at
abernethy
on
the
banks
of
the
tay
malcolm
and
william
met
and
the
english
chronicle
as
usual
informs
us
that
the
king
of
scots
became
the
man
of
the
english
king
but
as
malcolm
received
from
william
twelve
in
england
it
is
at
least
doubtful
whether
malcolm
paid
homage
for
these
alone
or
also
for
lothian
and
cumbria
or
for
either
of
them
there
is
at
all
events
no
question
about
the
scottish
historians
have
not
failed
to
point
out
that
the
value
of
the
homage
for
whatever
it
was
given
is
sufficiently
indicated
by
malcolm
dealings
with
gospatric
of
northumberland
whom
william
dismissed
as
a
traitor
and
rebel
within
about
six
months
of
the
abernethy
meeting
malcolm
gave
gospatric
the
earldom
of
dunbar
and
he
became
the
founder
of
the
great
house
of
march
no
further
invasion
took
place
till
when
malcolm
took
advantage
of
william
norman
difficulties
to
make
another
harrying
expedition
which
afforded
the
occasion
for
the
building
of
the
accession
of
rufus
and
his
difficulties
with
robert
of
normandy
led
in
to
a
somewhat
belated
attempt
by
malcolm
to
support
the
claims
of
the
ætheling
by
a
third
invasion
and
in
the
following
year
peace
was
made
rufus
confirmed
to
malcolm
the
grant
of
twelve
and
malcolm
in
turn
gave
the
english
king
such
homage
as
he
had
given
to
his
father
what
this
vague
statement
meant
it
was
reserved
for
the
bruce
to
determine
and
the
bruces
had
as
yet
not
one
foot
of
scottish
soil
the
agreement
made
in
did
not
prevent
rufus
from
completing
his
father
work
by
the
conquest
of
cumberland
to
which
the
scots
had
claims
malcolm
indignation
and
william
illness
led
to
a
famous
meeting
at
gloucester
whence
malcolm
withdrew
in
great
wrath
declining
to
be
treated
as
a
vassal
of
england
the
customary
invasion
followed
with
the
result
that
malcolm
was
slain
at
alnwick
in
november
but
the
great
effects
of
the
norman
conquest
as
regards
scotland
are
not
connected
with
strictly
international
affairs
they
are
partially
racial
and
in
other
respects
may
be
described
as
personal
it
is
unquestionable
that
there
was
an
immigration
of
the
northumbrian
population
into
scotland
but
the
northumbrian
population
were
and
the
north
of
england
was
not
thickly
populated
when
william
the
conqueror
ravaged
the
northern
counties
with
fire
and
sword
a
considerable
proportion
of
the
population
must
have
perished
the
actual
infusion
of
english
blood
may
thus
be
exaggerated
but
the
introduction
of
english
influences
can
not
be
questioned
these
influences
were
mainly
due
to
the
personality
of
malcolm
second
wife
the
saxon
princess
margaret
the
queen
was
a
woman
of
considerable
mental
power
and
possessed
a
great
influence
over
her
and
husband
she
was
a
devout
churchwoman
and
she
immediately
directed
her
energies
to
the
task
of
bringing
the
scottish
church
into
closer
communion
with
the
roman
the
changes
were
slight
in
themselves
all
that
we
know
of
them
is
an
alteration
in
the
beginning
of
lent
the
proper
observance
of
easter
and
of
sunday
and
a
question
still
disputed
about
the
tonsure
but
slight
as
they
were
they
stood
for
much
they
involved
the
abandonment
of
the
separate
position
held
by
the
scottish
church
and
its
acceptance
of
a
place
as
an
integral
portion
of
roman
christianity
the
result
was
to
make
the
papacy
for
the
first
time
an
important
factor
in
scottish
affairs
and
to
bridge
the
gulf
that
divided
scotland
from
continental
europe
we
soon
find
scottish
churchmen
seeking
learning
in
france
and
bringing
into
scotland
those
french
influences
which
were
destined
seriously
to
affect
the
civilization
of
the
country
but
above
all
these
roman
changes
were
important
just
because
they
were
anglican
introduced
by
an
english
queen
carried
out
by
english
clerics
emanating
from
a
court
which
was
rapidly
becoming
english
malcolm
subjects
thenceforth
began
to
adopt
english
customs
and
the
english
tongue
which
spread
from
the
court
of
queen
margaret
the
colony
of
english
refugees
represented
a
higher
civilization
and
a
more
advanced
state
of
commerce
than
the
scottish
celts
and
the
english
language
from
this
cause
also
made
rapid
progress
for
about
years
margaret
exercised
the
most
potent
influence
in
her
husband
kingdom
and
when
she
died
her
reputation
as
a
saint
and
her
subsequent
canonization
maintained
and
supported
the
traditions
she
had
created
not
only
did
she
have
on
her
side
the
power
of
a
court
and
the
prestige
of
courtly
etiquette
but
as
we
have
said
she
represented
a
higher
civilizing
force
than
that
which
was
opposed
to
her
and
hence
the
greatness
of
her
victory
it
must
however
be
remembered
that
the
spread
of
the
english
language
in
scotland
does
not
necessarily
imply
the
predominance
of
english
blood
it
means
rather
the
growth
of
english
commerce
we
can
trace
the
adoption
of
english
along
the
seaboard
and
in
the
towns
while
gaelic
still
remained
the
language
of
the
countryman
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
english
immigration
of
sufficient
proportions
to
overwhelm
the
gaelic
population
like
the
victory
of
the
conquered
english
over
the
conquering
normans
which
was
even
then
making
fast
progress
in
england
it
is
a
triumph
of
a
kind
that
subsequent
events
have
revealed
as
characteristically
and
it
called
into
force
the
powers
of
adaptation
and
of
colonization
which
have
brought
into
being
so
great
an
world
malcolm
reign
ended
in
defeat
and
failure
his
wife
died
of
grief
and
the
opportunity
presented
itself
of
a
celtic
reaction
against
the
anglicization
of
the
reign
of
malcolm
iii
the
throne
was
seized
by
malcolm
brother
donald
bane
malcolm
eldest
son
duncan
whose
mother
ingibjorg
had
been
a
dane
received
assistance
from
rufus
and
drove
donald
bane
after
a
reign
of
six
months
into
the
distant
north
but
after
about
six
months
he
himself
was
slain
in
a
small
fight
with
the
mormaer
or
earl
of
the
mearns
and
donald
bane
continued
to
reign
for
about
three
years
in
conjunction
with
edmund
a
son
of
malcolm
and
margaret
but
in
edgar
a
younger
brother
of
edmund
again
obtained
the
help
of
rufus
and
secured
the
throne
the
reign
of
edgar
is
important
in
two
respects
it
put
an
end
to
the
celtic
revival
and
reproduced
the
conditions
of
the
time
of
malcolm
and
margaret
henceforward
celtic
efforts
were
impossible
except
in
the
highlands
and
the
celts
of
the
lowlands
resigned
themselves
to
the
process
of
anglicization
imposed
upon
them
alike
by
ecclesiastical
political
and
commercial
circumstances
it
saw
also
the
beginning
of
an
influence
which
was
to
prove
scarcely
less
fruitful
in
results
than
the
triumph
of
which
we
have
spoken
in
november
sister
matilda
was
married
to
the
norman
king
of
england
henry
i
and
two
years
later
another
sister
mary
was
married

eustace
count
of

the
son
of
the
future
king
stephen
these
unions
with
a
son
and
a
grandson
respectively
of
william
the
conqueror
prepared
the
way
for
the
norman
conquest
of
scotland
edgar
died
in
january
and
his
brother
and
successor
alexander
i
espoused
an
sybilla
who
is
generally
supposed
to
have
been
a
natural
daughter
of
henry
i
on
the
death
of
alexander
in
these
norman
influences
acquired
a
new
importance
under
his
brother
david
the
youngest
son
of

and
margaret
during
the
troubles
which
followed
his
death
david
had
been
educated
in

and
after
the
marriage
of

and

had
resided
at

court
of
his
till
the
death
of

became

and
the
southern
portion

norman
baron
in
this
way
the
earldom
of
huntingdon
became
attached
to
the
scottish
throne
and
afforded
an
occasion
for
reviving
the
old
question
of
homage
moreover
waltheof
of
huntingdon
was
the
son
of
siward
of
northumbria
and
david
regarded
himself
as
on
this
account
possessing
claims
over
northumbria
david
as
we
have
seen
had
been
brought
up
under
norman
influences
and
it
is
under
the
son
of
the
saxon
margaret
that
the
bloodless
norman
conquest
of
scotland
took
place
edgar
had
recognized
the
new
english
nobility
and
settlers
by
addressing
charters
to
all
in
his
kingdom
both
scots
and
english
his
brother
david
speaks
of
french
and
english
scots
and
galwegians
the
charters
are
of
course
addressed
to
barons
and
and
their
evidence
refers
to
the
english
and
nobility
the
norman
fascination
which
had
been
turned
to
such
good
account
in
england
in
italy
and
in
the
holy
land
had
completely
vanquished
such
english
prepossessions
as
david
might
have
inherited
from
his
mother
normans
like
the
bruces
and
the
fitzalans
afterwards
the
stewarts
came
to
david
court
and
received
from
him
grants
of
land
the
number
of
norman
signatures
that
attest
his
charters
show
that
his
was
mainly
norman
he
was
a
very
devout
a
sair
sanct
for
the
crown
as
james
vi
called
him
and
norman
prelate
and
norman
abbot
helped
to
increase
the
total
of
norman
influence
he
transformed
scotland
into
a
feudal
country
gave
grants
of
land
by
feudal
tenure
summoned
a
great
council
on
the
feudal
principle
and
attempted
to
create
such
a
monarchy
as
that
of
which
henry
i
was
laying
the
foundations
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
this
strong
norman
influence
helped
to
prepare
the
scottish
people
for
the
french
alliance
but
its
more
immediate
effect
was
to
bring
about
the
existence
of
an
nobility
these
great
norman
names
were
to
become
great
in
scottish
story
but
it
required
a
long
process
to
make
their
bearers
in
any
sense
scotsmen
most
of
them
had
come
from
england
many
of
them
held
lands
in
england
and
none
of
them
could
be
expected
to
feel
any
real
difference
between
themselves
and
their
english
fellows
during
the
reign
of
henry
i
influences
thus
worked
a
great
change
in
scotland
on
henry
death
david
as
the
uncle
of
the
empress
matilda
immediately
took
up
arms
on
her
behalf
stephen
with
the
wisdom
which
characterized
the
beginning
of
his
reign
came
to
terms
with
him
at
durham
david
did
not
personally
acknowledge
the
usurper
but
his
son
henry
did
him
homage
for
huntingdon
and
some
possessions
in
the
north
in
the
following
year
david
claimed
northumberland
for
henry
as
the
representative
of
siward
and
on
stephen
refusal
again
adopted
the
cause
of
the
empress
the
usual
invasion
of
england
followed
and
after
some
months
of
ravaging
a
short
truce
and
a
slight
scottish
victory
gained
at
clitheroe
on
the
ribble
in
june
the
final
result
was
david
great
defeat
in
the
battle
of
the
standard
fought
near
northallerton
on
the
august
the
battle
of
the
standard
possesses
no
special
interest
for
students
of
the
art
of
war
the
english
army
under
william
of
albemarle
and
walter
was
drawn
up
in
one
line
of
battle
consisting
of
knights
in
coats
of
mail
archers
and
spearmen
the
scots
were
in
four
divisions
the
van
was
composed
of
the
picts
of
galloway
the
right
wing
was
led
by
prince
henry
and
the
men
of
lothian
were
on
the
left
behind
fought
king
david
with
the
men
of
moray
the
galwegians
made
several
unsuccessful
attempts
upon
the
english
centre
prince
henry
led
his
horse
through
the
english
left
wing
but
the
infantry
failed
to
follow
and
the
prince
lost
his
advantage
by
a
premature
attempt
to
plunder
the
scottish
right
made
a
pusillanimous
attempt
on
the
english
left
and
the
reserve
began
to
desert
king
david
who
collected
the
remnants
of
his
army
and
retired
in
safety
to
a
height
above
cowton
moor
the
scene
of
the
fight
prince
henry
was
left
surrounded
by
the
enemy
but
saved
the
position
by
a
clever
stratagem
and
rejoined
his
father
oman
remarks
that
the
battle
was
of
a
very
abnormal
type
for
the
twelfth
century
since
the
side
which
had
the
advantage
in
cavalry
made
no
attempt
to
use
it
while
that
which
was
weak
in
the
arm
made
a
creditable
attempt
to
turn
it
to
account
by
breaking
into
the
hostile
flank
wild
rushes
of
unmailed
clansmen
against
a
steady
front
of
spears
and
bows
never
succeeded
in
this
respect
northallerton
is
the
forerunner
of
dupplin
halidon
hill
flodden
and
pinkie
the
chief
interest
for
our
purpose
attaching
to
the
battle
of
the
standard
is
connected
with
the
light
it
throws
upon
the
racial
complexion
of
the
country
seventy
years
after
the
norman
conquest
our
chief
authorities
are
the
hexham
chroniclers
and
ailred
of
rivaulx
english
writers
of
the
twelfth
century
they
speak
of
david
host
as
composed
of
angli
picti
and
scoti
the
angli
alone
contained
mailed
knights
in
their
ranks
and
david
first
intention
was
to
send
these
warriors
against
the
english
while
the
picts
and
scots
were
to
follow
with
sword
and
targe
the
galwegians
and
the
scots
from
beyond
forth
strongly
opposed
this
arrangement
and
assured
the
king
that
his
unarmed
highlanders
would
fight
better
than
these
frenchmen
the
king
gave
the
place
of
honour
to
the
galwegians
and
altered
his
whole
plan
of
battle
the
whole
context
and
the
earl
of
strathern
sneer
at
these
frenchmen
would
seem
to
show
that
the
angli
are
at
all
events
clearly
distinguished
from
the
picts
of
galloway
and
the
scots
who
like
malise
of
strathern
came
from
beyond
the
forth
it
is
probable
that
the
angli
were
the
men
of
lothian
but
it
must
also
be
recollected
both
that
the
term
included
the
nobility
these
frenchman
and
the
english
settlers
who
had
followed
queen
margaret
and
that
david
was
fighting
in
an
english
quarrel
and
in
the
interests
of
an
english
queen
the
knights
who
wore
coats
of
mail
were
entirely
and
it
is
against
them
that
the
claim
of
the
highlanders
is
particularly
directed
when
richard
of
hexham
tells
us
that
angles
scots
and
picts
fell
out
by
the
way
as
they
returned
home
he
means
to
contrast
the
men
of
lothian
and
the
new
nobility
with
the
picts
of
galloway
and
the
highlanders
from
north
of
the
forth
and
this
unusual
application
of
the
term
to
a
portion
of
the
scottish
army
is
an
indication
not
that
the
lowlanders
were
entirely
english
but
that
there
was
a
strong
jealousy
between
the
scots
and
the
new
english
nobility
the
angli
are
above
all
others
the
knights
in
mail
it
is
not
possible
to
credit
david
with
any
real
affection
for
the
cause
of
the
empress
or
with
any
higher
motive
than
selfish
greed
and
it
can
scarcely
be
claimed
that
he
kept
faith
with
stephen
such
however
were
the
difficulties
of
the
english
king
that
in
spite
of
his
crushing
defeat
david
reaped
the
advantages
of
victory
peace
was
made
in
april
by
the
treaty
of
durham
which
secured
to
prince
henry
the
earldom
of
northumberland
as
an
english
fief
the
scottish
border
line
which
had
successively
enclosed
strathclyde
and
part
of
cumberland
and
the
lothians
now
extended
to
the
tees
david
gave
stephen
some
assistance
in
but
on
the
victory
of
the
empress
maud
at
lincoln
in
david
deserted
the
captive
king
and
was
present
on
the
empress
side
at
her
defeat
at
winchester
in
eight
years
later
he
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
claimant
henry
afterwards
henry
ii
by
which
the
eldest
son
of
the
scottish
king
was
to
retain
his
english
fiefs
and
david
was
to
aid
henry
against
stephen
an
unsuccessful
attempt
on
england
followed
the
last
of
david
numerous
invasions
when
he
died
in
he
left
scotland
in
a
position
of
power
with
regard
to
england
such
as
she
was
never
again
to
occupy
the
religious
devotion
which
secured
for
him
a
popular
canonization
he
was
never
actually
canonized
can
scarcely
justify
his
conduct
to
stephen
but
it
must
be
recollected
that
throughout
his
reign
there
is
comparatively
little
racial
antagonism
between
the
two
countries
david
interfered
in
an
english
civil
war
and
took
part
now
on
one
side
and
now
on
the
other
but
the
whole
effect
of
his
life
was
to
bring
the
nations
more
closely
together
through
the
norman
influences
which
he
encouraged
in
scotland
his
son
and
heir
held
great
fiefs
in
england
and
he
granted
tracts
of
land
to
nobles
a
bruce
and
a
balliol
who
each
held
possessions
both
in
scotland
and
in
england
tried
to
prevent
the
battle
of
the
standard
their
efforts
proved
fruitless
but
the
fact
is
notable
and
significant
david
eldest
son
the
gallant
prince
henry
who
had
led
the
wild
charge
at
northallerton
predeceased
his
father
in
he
left
three
sons
of
whom
the
two
elder
malcolm
and
william
became
successively
kings
of
scotland
while
from
the
youngest
david
earl
of
huntingdon
were
descended
the
claimants
at
the
first
it
was
the
fate
of
scotland
as
so
often
again
to
be
governed
by
a
child
and
a
strong
king
henry
ii
was
now
on
the
throne
of
england
as
david
i
had
taken
advantage
of
the
weakness
of
stephen
so
now
did
henry
ii
benefit
by
the
youth
of
malcolm
iv
in
spite
of
the
agreement
into
which
henry
had
entered
with
david
in
he
in
obtained
from
malcolm
then
fourteen
years
of
age
the
resignation
of
his
claims
upon
northumberland
cumberland
and
westmoreland
in
return
for
this
malcolm
received
a
confirmation
of
the
earldom
of
huntingdon
cf
the
abandonment
of
the
northern
claims
seems
to
have
led
to
a
quarrel
for
henry
refused
to
knight
the
scots
king
but
in
the
following
year
malcolm
accompanied
henry
in
his
expedition
to
toulouse
and
received
his
knighthood
at
henry
hands
malcolm
subsequent
troubles
were
connected
with
rebellions
in
moray
and
in
galloway
against
the
new
and
with
the
ambition
of
somerled
the
ruler
of
argyll
and
of
the
still
independent
western
islands
the
only
occasion
on
which
he
again
entered
into
relations
with
england
was
in
when
he
met
henry
at
woodstock
and
did
homage
to
his
eldest
son
who
became
known
as
henry
iii
although
he
never
actually
reigned
as
usual
there
is
no
statement
precisely
defining
the
homage
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
king
of
scots
was
also
earl
of
huntingdon
malcolm
died
in
and
was
succeeded
by
his
brother
william
the
lion
who
reigned
for
nearly
fifty
years
henry
was
now
in
the
midst
of
his
great
struggle
with
the
church
but
william
made
no
attempt
to
use
the
opportunity
he
accepted
the
earldom
of
huntingdon
from
henry
and
in
when
the
younger
henry
was
crowned
in
becket
despite
william
took
the
oath
of
fealty
to
him
as
earl
of
huntingdon
but
in
when
the
english
king
ungrateful
son
organized
a
baronial
revolt
william
decided
that
his
chance
had
come
his
grandfather
david
had
made
him
earl
of
northumberland
and
the
resignation
which
henry
had
extorted
from
the
weakness
of
malcolm
iv
could
scarcely
be
held
as
binding
upon
william
so
william
marched
into
england
to
aid
the
rebel
prince
and
after
some
skirmishes
and
the
usual
ravaging
was
surprised
while
tilting
near
alnwick
and
made
a
captive
he
was
conveyed
to
the
castle
of
falaise
in
normandy
and
there
on
december
as
a
condition
of
his
release
he
signed
the
treaty
of
falaise
which
rendered
the
kingdom
of
scotland
for
fifteen
years
unquestionably
the
vassal
of
england
the
treaty
acknowledged
henry
ii
as
overlord
of
scotland
and
expressly
stated
the
dependence
of
the
scottish
church
upon
that
of
england
the
relations
of
the
churches
had
been
an
additional
cause
of
difficulty
since
the
time
of
margaret
and
the
present
arrangement
was
in
no
sense
final
a
papal
legate
held
a
council
in
edinburgh
in
and
ten
years
afterwards
pope
clement
iii
took
the
scottish
church
directly
under
his
own
protection
about
the
political
relationship
there
could
be
no
such
doubt
william
stood
theoretically
if
not
actually
in
much
the
same
position
to
henry
ii
as
john
baliol
afterwards
occupied
to
edward
i
it
was
not
till
the
accession
of
richard
i
that
william
recovered
his
freedom
the
castles
in
the
south
of
scotland
which
had
been
delivered
to
the
english
were
restored
and
the
independence
of
scotland
was
admitted
on
william
paying
richard
the
sum
of
marks
this
agreement
dated
december
annulled
the
terms
of
the
treaty
of
falaise
and
left
the
position
of
william
the
lion
exactly
what
it
had
been
at
the
death
of
malcolm
iv
he
remained
liegeman
for
such
lands
as
the
scottish
kings
had
in
times
past
done
homage
to
england
the
agreement
with
richard
i
is
certainly
not
incompatible
with
the
scottish
position
that
the
homage
before
the
treaty
of
falaise
applied
only
to
the
earldom
of
huntingdon
but
the
usual
vagueness
was
maintained
and
the
arrangement
in
no
way
determines
the
question
of
the
homage
paid
by
the
earlier
scottish
kings
for
a
hundred
years
after
this
date
the
two
countries
were
never
at
war
william
had
difficulties
with
john
in
an
outbreak
of
hostilities
seemed
almost
certain
but
the
two
kings
came
to
terms
the
long
reign
of
william
came
to
an
end
in
his
son
and
successor
alexander
ii
joined
the
french
party
in
england
which
was
defeated
at
lincoln
in
alexander
made
peace
with
the
regent
resigned
all
claims
to
northumberland
and
did
homage
for
his
english
possessions
the
most
important
of
which
was
the
earldom
of
huntingdon
which
had
since
been
held
by
his
uncle
david
known
as
david
of
huntingdon
in
he
married
joanna
sister
of
henry
iii
another
marriage
negotiated
at
the
same
time
was
probably
of
more
real
importance
margaret
the
eldest
daughter
of
william
the
lion
became
the
wife
of
the
justiciar
of
england
hubert
de
burgh
hume
brown
has
pointed
out
that
immediately
on
the
fall
of
hubert
de
burgh
a
dispute
arose
between
henry
and
alexander
the
english
king
desired
alexander
to
acknowledge
the
treaty
of
falaise
and
this
alexander
refused
to
do
the
agreement
which
averted
an
appeal
to
the
sword
was
on
the
whole
favourable
to
scotland
nothing
was
said
about
homage
for
this
kingdom
david
of
huntingdon
had
died
in
and
alexander
gave
up
the
southern
earldom
but
received
a
fief
in
the
northern
counties
always
coveted
of
the
kings
of
scotland
this
arrangement
is
known
as
the
treaty
of
york
some
trifling
incidents
and
the
second
marriage
of
alexander
which
brought
scotland
into
closer
touch
with
france
he
married
marie
daughter
of
enguerand
de
coucy
nearly
provoked
a
rupture
in
but
the
domestic
troubles
of
henry
and
alexander
alike
prevented
any
breach
of
the
long
peace
which
had
subsisted
since
the
capture
of
william
the
lion
in
the
scottish
king
died
and
his
son
and
successor
alexander
iii
was
knighted
by
henry
of
england
and
in
married
margaret
henry
eldest
daughter
the
relations
of
alexander
to
henry
iii
and
to
edward
i
will
be
narrated
in
the
following
chapter
not
once
throughout
his
reign
was
any
blood
spilt
in
an
english
quarrel
and
the
story
of
his
reign
forms
no
part
of
our
subject
its
most
interesting
event
is
the
battle
of
largs
the
scottish
kings
had
for
some
time
been
attempting
to
annex
the
islands
and
in
hakon
of
norway
invaded
scotland
as
a
retributive
measure
he
was
defeated
at
the
battle
of
largs
and
in
the
isles
were
annexed
to
the
scottish
crown
the
fact
that
this
forcible
annexation
took
place
after
a
struggle
only
twenty
years
before
the
death
of
alexander
iii
must
be
borne
in
mind
in
connection
with
the
part
played
by
the
islanders
in
the
war
of
independence

scotland
had
found

a

struggle
with
the

the
misfortunes
which
had
overtaken
scotland
in
the
premature
deaths
of
alexander
and
his
three
children
might
yet
prove
a
very
real
blessing
if
they
prepared
the
way
for
the
creation
of
a
great
island
kingdom
which
should
be
at

free
and

the
little
margaret
the
maid
of
norway
edward
had
been
acknowledged
heir
to
the
throne
of
her
grandfather
in
february
and
on
his
death
her
succession
was
admitted
the
great
council
met
at
scone
in
april
and
appointed
six
guardians
of
the
kingdom
it
was
no
easy
task
which
was
entrusted
to
them
for
the
claim
of
a
child
and
a
foreigner
could
not
but
be
disputed
by
the
barons
who
stood
nearest
to
the
throne
the
only
rival
who
attempted
to
rebel
was
robert
bruce
of
annandale
who
had
been
promised
the
succession
by
alexander
ii
and
had
been
disappointed
of
the
fulfilment
of
his
hopes
by
the
birth
of
the
late
king
in
the
deaths
of
two
of
the
guardians
added
to
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
and
it
was
with
something
like
relief
that
the
scots
heard
that
eric
of
norway
the
father
of
their
queen
wished
to
come
to
an
arrangement
with
edward
of
england
in
whose
power
he
lay
the
result
of
eric
negotiations
with
edward
was
that
a
conference
met
at
salisbury
in
and
was
attended
on
edward
invitation
by
four
scottish
representatives
who
included
robert
bruce
and
three
of
the
guardians
such
were
the
troubles
of
the
country
that
the
scots
willingly
acceded
to
edward
proposals
which
gave
him
an
interest
in
the
government
of
scotland
and
they
heard
with
delight
that
he
contemplated
the
marriage
of
their
little
queen
to
his
son
edward
then
two
years
of
age
the
english
king
was
assured
of
the
satisfaction
which
such
a
marriage
would
give
to
scotland
and
the
result
was
that
by
the
treaty
of
brigham
in
the
marriage
was
duly
arranged
edward
had
previously
obtained
the
necessary
dispensation
from
the
pope
the
eagerness
with
which
the
scots
welcomed
the
proposal
of
marriage
was
sufficient
evidence
that
the
time
had
come
for
carrying
out
statesmanlike
scheme
but
the
conditions
which
were
annexed
to
it
should
have
warned
him
that
there
were
limits
to
the
scottish
compliance
with
his
wishes
scotland
was
not
in
any
way
to
be
absorbed
by
england
although
the
crowns
would
be
united
in
the
persons
of
edward
and
margaret
edward
wisely
made
no
attempt
to
force
scotland
into
any
more
complete
union
although
he
could
not
but
expect
that
the
union
of
the
crowns
would
prepare
the
way
for
a
union
of
the
kingdoms
he
certainly
interpreted
in
the
widest
sense
the
rights
given
him
by
the
treaty
of
brigham
but
when
the
scots
objected
to
his
demand
that
all
scottish
castles
should
be
placed
in
his
power
he
gave
way
without
rousing
further
suspicion
or
indignation
hitherto
his
policy
had
been
characterized
by
the
great
sagacity
which
he
had
shown
in
his
conduct
of
english
affairs
it
is
impossible
to
refuse
either
to
sympathize
with
his
ideals
or
to
admire
the
tact
he
displayed
in
his
negotiations
with
scotland
his
considerateness
extended
even
to
the
little
maid
of
norway
for
whose
benefit
he
victualled
with
raisins
and
other
fruit
the
large
ship
which
he
sent
to
conduct
her
to
england
but
the
large
ship
returned
to
england
with
a
message
from
king
eric
that
he
would
not
entrust
his
daughter
to
an
english
vessel
the
patient
edward
sent
it
back
again
and
it
was
probably
in
it
that
the
child
set
sail
in
september
some
weeks
later
bishop
fraser
of
andrews
one
of
the
guardians
and
a
supporter
of
the
english
interest
wrote
to
edward
that
he
had
heard
a
sorrowful
rumour
regarding
the
queen
the
rumour
proved
to
be
in
circumstances
which
are
unknown
to
us
the
poor
died
on
her
voyage
and
her
death
proved
a
fatal
blow
to
the
work
on
which
edward
had
been
engaged
for
the
last
four
years
of
the
thirteen
competitors
who
put
forward
claims
to
the
crown
only
three
need
be
here
mentioned
they
were
each
descended
from
david
earl
of
huntingdon
brother
of
william
the
lion
and
grandson
of
david
i
the
claimant
who
according
to
the
strict
rules
of
primogeniture
had
the
best
right
was
john
balliol
the
grandson
of
margaret
the
eldest
daughter
of
earl
david
his
most
formidable
opponent
was
robert
bruce
of
annandale
the
son
of
earl
david
second
daughter
isabella
who
based
his
candidature
on
the
fact
that
he
was
the
grandson
whereas
balliol
was
the
of
the
earl
of
huntingdon
through
whom
both
the
rivals
claimed
the
third
john
hastings
was
the
grandson
of
youngest
daughter
ada
bishop
fraser
in
the
letter
to
which
we
have
already
referred
urged
edward
i
to
interfere
in
favour
of
john
balliol
who
might
be
employed
to
further
english
interests
in
scotland
the
english
king
thereupon
decided
to
put
forward
a
definite
claim
to
be
lord
paramount
and
in
virtue
of
that
right
to
decide
the
disputed
succession
since
richard
i
had
restored
his
independence
to
william
the
lion
in
the
question
of
the
overlordship
had
lain
almost
entirely
dormant
on
john
succession
william
had
done
homage
saving
his
own
right
but
whether
the
homage
was
for
scotland
or
solely
for
his
english
fiefs
was
not
clear
his
successor
alexander
ii
aided
louis
of
france
against
the
infant
henry
iii
and
after
the
battle
of
lincoln
came
to
an
agreement
with
the
regent
by
which
he
did
homage
to
henry
iii
but
only
for
the
earldom
of
huntingdon
and
his
other
possessions
in
kingdom
after
the
fall
of
hubert
de
burgh
henry
used
his
influence
with
pope
gregory
ix
who
looked
upon
the
english
king
as
a
valuable
ally
in
the
great
struggle
with
frederick
ii
to
persuade
the
pope
to
order
the
king
of
scots
to
acknowledge
henry
as
his
overlord
alexander
refused
to
comply
with
the
papal
injunction
and
the
matter
was
not
definitely
settled
henry
made
no
attempt
to
enforce
his
claim
and
merely
came
to
an
agreement
with
alexander
regarding
the
english
possessions
of
the
scottish
king
during
the
minority
of
alexander
iii
when
henry
was
for
two
years
the
real
ruler
of
scotland
he
described
himself
not
as
lord
paramount
but
as
chief
adviser
of
the
scottish
king
lastly
when
in
alexander
iii
took
a
solemn
oath
of
homage
to
edward
at
westminster
he
according
to
the
scottish
account
of
the
affair
made
an
equally
solemn
avowal
that
to
god
alone
was
his
homage
due
for
the
kingdom
of
scotland
and
edward
had
accepted
the
homage
thus
rendered
it
is
thus
clear
that
edward
regarded
the
claim
of
the
overlordship
as
a
trump
card
to
be
played
only
in
special
circumstances
and
these
appeared
now
to
have
arisen
the
death
of
the
maid
of
norway
had
deprived
him
of
his
right
to
interfere
in
the
affairs
of
scotland
and
had
destroyed
his
hopes
of
a
marriage
alliance
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
hope
of
carrying
out
his
scottish
policy
had
vanished
unless
he
could
take
advantage
of
the
helpless
condition
of
the
country
to
obtain
a
full
and
final
recognition
of
a
claim
which
had
been
denied
for
exactly
a
hundred
years
at
first
it
seemed
as
if
the
scheme
were
to
prove
satisfactory
the
norman
nobles
who
claimed
the
throne
declared
after
some
hesitation
their
willingness
to
acknowledge
edward
claim
to
be
lord
paramount
and
the
english
king
was
therefore
arbiter
of
the
situation
he
now
obtained
what
he
had
asked
in
vain
in
the
preceding
year
the
delivery
into
english
hands
of
all
scottish
strongholds
june
edward
delayed
his
decision
till
the
november
when
after
much
disputation
regarding
legal
precedents
and
many
consultations
with
scottish
commissioners
and
the
english
parliament
he
finally
adjudged
the
crown
to
john
balliol
it
can
not
be
argued
that
the
decision
was
unfair
but
edward
was
fortunate
in
finding
that
the
candidate
whose
hereditary
claim
was
strongest
was
also
the
man
most
fitted
to
occupy
the
position
of
a
vassal
king
the
new
monarch
made
a
full
and
indisputable
acknowledgment
of
his
position
as
edward
liege
and
the
great
seal
of
the
kingdom
of
scotland
was
publicly
destroyed
in
token
of
the
position
of
vassalage
in
which
the
country
now
stood
of
what
followed
it
is
difficult
to
speak
with
any
certainty
balliol
occupied
the
throne
for
three
and
a
half
years
and
was
engaged
during
the
whole
of
that
period
in
disputes
with
his
superior
the
details
need
not
detain
us
edward
claimed
to
be
final
judge
in
all
scottish
cases
he
summoned
balliol
to
his
court
to
plead
against
one
of
the
scottish
king
own
vassals
and
to
receive
instructions
with
regard
to
the
raising
of
money
for
edward
needs
it
may
fairly
be
said
that
edward
treatment
of
balliol
does
give
grounds
for
the
view
of
scottish
historians
that
the
english
king
was
determined
from
the
first
to
goad
his
wretched
vassal
into
rebellion
in
order
to
give
him
an
opportunity
of
absorbing
the
country
in
his
english
kingdom
on
the
other
hand
it
may
be
argued
that
if
this
was
edward
aim
he
was
singularly
unfortunate
in
the
time
he
chose
for
forcing
a
crisis
he
was
at
war
with
philip
iv
of
france
madoc
was
raising
his
welsh
rebellion
and
edward
seizure
of
wool
had
created
much
indignation
among
his
own
subjects
however
this
may
be
it
is
certain
that
balliol
rankling
with
a
sense
of
injustice
caused
by
the
ignominy
which
edward
had
heaped
upon
him
and
rendered
desperate
by
the
complaints
of
his
own
subjects
decided
by
the
advice
of
the
great
council
to
disown
his
allegiance
to
the
king
of
england
and
to
enter
upon
an
alliance
with
france
it
is
noteworthy
that
the
policy
of
the
french
alliance
as
an
movement
which
became
the
watchword
of
the
patriotic
party
in
scotland
was
inaugurated
by
john
balliol
the
scots
commenced
hostilities
by
some
predatory
incursions
into
the
northern
counties
of
england
in
whether
or
not
edward
was
waiting
for
the
opportunity
thus
given
him
he
certainly
took
full
advantage
of
it
undisturbed
by
his
numerous
difficulties
he
marched
northwards
to
the
town
of
tradition
tells
that
he
was
exasperated
by
insults
showered
upon
him
by
the
inhabitants
but
the
story
can
not
go
far
to
excuse
the
massacre
which
followed
the
capture
of
the
town
after
more
than
a
century
of
peace
the
first
important
act
of
war
was
marked
by
a
brutality
which
was
a
fitting
prelude
to
more
than
two
centuries
of
fierce
and
bloody
fighting
on
edward
policy
of
thorough
as
exemplified
at
berwick
must
rest
to
some
extent
the
responsibility
for
the
unnecessary
ferocity
which
distinguished
the
scottish
war
of
independence
it
was
from
a
military

complete
and

was
unquestionably
a
failure

to

scotland

country

continued

off

he
also
despoiled
scotland
of
many
of
its

might
serve
to
remind
his

a
leader
round
whom
it
might
rally
a
leader
arose
in
the
person
of
sir
william
wallace
a
heroic
and
somewhat
mysterious
figure
who
first
attracted
notice
in
the
autumn
of
and
by
the
spring
of
the
following
year
had
gathered
round
him
a
band
of
guerilla
warriors
by
whose
help
he
was
able
to
make
serious
attacks
upon
the
english
garrisons
of
lanark
and
scone
may
these
exploits
of
little
importance
in
themselves
sufficed
to
attract
the
popular
feeling
towards
wallace
the
domestic
difficulties
of
edward
i
rendered
the
time
opportune
for
a
rising
and
despite
the
failure
of
an
and
attempt
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
more
patriotic
barons
which
led
to
the
submission
of
irvine
in
the
little
army
which
wallace
had
collected
rapidly
grew
in
courage
and
in
numbers
and
its
leader
laid
siege
to
the
castle
of
dundee
he
had
now
attained
a
position
of
such
importance
that
surrey
and
cressingham
found
it
necessary
to
take
strong
measures
against
him
and
they
assembled
at
stirling
whither
wallace
marched
to
meet
them
the
battle
of
stirling
bridge
or
more
strictly
cambuskenneth
bridge
was
fought
on
september
wallace
with
his
army
of
knights
and
spearmen
took
up
his
position
on
the
abbey
craig
with
the
forth
between
him
and
the
english
less
than
a
mile
from
the
scottish
camp
was
a
small
bridge
over
the
river
giving
access
to
the
abbey
of
cambuskenneth
surrey
rashly
attempted
to
cross
this
bridge
in
the
face
of
the
scots
and
wallace
after
a
considerable
number
of
the
enemy
had
been
allowed
to
reach
the
northern
bank
ordered
an
attack
the
english
failed
to
keep
the
bridge
and
their
force
became
divided
surrey
was
unable
to
offer
any
assistance
to
his
vanguard
and
they
fell
an
easy
prey
to
the
scots
while
the
english
general
with
the
remnants
of
his
army
retreated
to
berwick
stirling
was
the
great
military
key
of
the
country
commanding
all
the
passes
from
south
to
north
and
the
great
defeat
which
the
english
had
sustained
placed
the
country
in
the
power
of
wallace
along
with
an
andrew
de
moray
of
whose
identity
we
know
nothing
he
undertook
the
government
of
the
country
corresponded
in
the
name
of
scotland
with
lübeck
and
hamburg
and
took
the
offensive
against
england
in
an
expedition
which
ravaged
as
far
south
as
hexham
to
the
great
monastery
of
hexham
he
granted
protection
in
the
name
of
the
leaders
of
the
army
of
scotland
although
he
was
not
successful
in
restraining
the
ferocity
of
his
followers
the
document
in
question
is
granted
in
the
name
of
john
king
of
scotland
and
in
a
charter
dated
march
wallace
describes
himself
as
guardian
of
the
kingdom
of
scotland
acting
for
the
exiled
balliol
in
the
following
summer
edward
marched
into
scotland
and
although
his
forces
were
in
serious
difficulties
from
want
of
food
he
went
forward
to
meet
wallace
who
held
a
strong
position
at
falkirk
wallace
prepared
to
meet
edward
by
drawing
up
his
spearmen
in
four
great
schiltrons
or
divisions
with
a
reserve
of
cavalry
his
flanks
were
protected
by
archers
and
he
had
also
placed
archers
between
the
divisions
of
spearmen
on
the
english
side
edward
himself
commanded
the
centre
the
earls
of
norfolk
and
hereford
the
right
and
the
bishop
of
durham
the
left
the
scottish
defeat
was
the
result
of
a
combination
of
archers
and
cavalry
the
first
attack
of
the
english
horse
was
completely
repulsed
by
the
spearmen
the
front
ranks
says
oman
knelt
with
their
fixed
in
the
earth
the
rear
ranks
levelled
their
lances
over
their
comrades
heads
the
grove
of
spears
was
far
too
dense
for
the
cavalry
to
penetrate
but
edward
withdrew
the
cavalry
and
ordered
the
archers
to
send
a
shower
of
arrows
on
the
scots
wallace
cavalry
made
no
attempt
to
interfere
with
the
archers
the
scottish
bowmen
were
too
few
to
retaliate
and
when
the
english
horse
next
charged
they
found
many
weak
points
in
the
schiltrons
and
broke
up
the
scottish
host
as
the
battle
of
stirling
had
created
the
power
of
wallace
so
that
of
falkirk
completely
destroyed
it
he
almost
immediately
resigned
his
office
of
guardian
mainly
according
to
tradition
because
of
the
jealousy
with
which
the
great
barons
regarded
him
and
took
refuge
in
france
edward
was
still
in
the
midst
of
difficulties
both
foreign
and
domestic
and
he
was
unable
to
reduce
the
country
the
scots
elected
new
guardians
who
regarded
themselves
as
regents
not
for
edward
but
for
balliol
they
included
john
comyn
and
robert
bruce
earl
of
carrick
the
future
king
the
guardians
were
successful
in
persuading
both
philip
iv
of
france
and
pope
boniface
viii
to
intervene
in
their
favour
but
edward
disregarded
the
papal
interference
and
though
he
was
too
busy
to
complete
his
conquest
he
sent
an
army
into
scotland
in
each
of
the
years
and
military
operations
were
almost
entirely
confined
to
ravaging
but
in
february
comyn
completely
defeated
at
rosslyn
near
edinburgh
an
english
army
under
sir
john
segrave
and
ralph
de
manton
whom
edward
had
ordered
to
make
a
foray
in
scotland
about
the
beginning
of
lent
in
the
summer
of
the
english
king
roused
perhaps
by
this
small
success
and
able
to
give
his
undivided
attention
to
scotland
conducted
an
invasion
on
a
larger
scale
in
september
he
traversed
the
country
as
far
north
as
elgin
and
remaining
in
scotland
during
the
winter
of
he
set
to
work
in
the
spring
to
reduce
the
castle
of
stirling
which
still
held
out
against
him
when
the
garrison
surrendered
in
july
scotland
lay
at
edward
feet
comyn
had
already
submitted
to
the
english
king
and
edward
personal
vindictiveness
was
satisfied
by
the
capture
of
wallace
by
sir
john
menteith
a
scotsman
who
had
been
acting
in
the
english
interest
wallace
was
taken
to
london
subjected
to
a
mock
trial
tortured
and
put
to
death
with
ignominy
on
the
august
his
head
was
placed
on
london
bridge
and
portions
of
his
body
were
sent
to
scotland
his
memory
served
as
an
inspiration
for
the
cause
of
freedom
and
it
is
held
in
just
reverence
to
the
present
hour
if
it
is
true
that
he
did
not
scruple
to
go
beyond
what
we
should
regard
as
the
limits
of
honourable
warfare
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
was
fighting
an
enemy
who
had
also
disregarded
these
limits
and
much
may
be
forgiven
to
brave
men
who
are
resisting
a
gratuitous
war
of
conquest
when
he
died
his
work
seemed
to
have
failed
but
he
had
shown
his
countrymen
how
to
resist
edward
and
he
had
given
sufficient
evidence
of
the
strength
of
national
feeling
if
only
it
could
find
a
suitable
leader
the
english
had
to
learn
the
lesson
which
five
centuries
later
napoleon
had
to
learn
in
spain
and
scotland
can
not
forget
that
wallace
was
the
first
to
teach
it
it
is
not
less
pathetic
to
turn
to
edward
scheme
for
the
government
of
scotland
it
bears
the
impress
of
a
mind
which
was
that
of
a
statesman
and
a
lawyer
as
well
as
a
soldier
it
is
impossible
to
deny
a
tribute
of
admiration
to
its
wisdom
or
to
question
the
probability
of
its
success
in
other
circumstances
had
the
course
of
events
been
more
propitious
for
edward
great
plan
scotland
and
england
might
have
been
spared
much
suffering
but
edward
failed
to
realize
that
the
scots
could
no
longer
regard
him
as
the
friend
and
ally
to
whose
son
they
had
willingly
agreed
to
marry
their
queen
he
was
now
but
a
military
conqueror
in
temporary
possession
of
their
country
an
enemy
to
be
resisted
by
any
means
the
new
constitution
was
foredoomed
to
failure
carrying
out
his
scheme
of
edward
created
no
but
placed
scotland
under
his
own
nephew
john
of
brittany
he
interfered
as
little
as
might
be
with
the
customs
and
laws
of
the
country
he
placed
over
it
eight
justiciars
with
sheriffs
under
them
in
edward
parliament
which
met
at
london
was
attended
by
scottish
representatives
the
incorporation
of
the
country
with
its
larger
neighbour
was
complete
but
it
involved
as
little
change
as
was
possible
in
the
circumstances
the
parliament
of
was
attended
by
robert
bruce
earl
of
carrick
who
attended
not
as
a
representative
of
scotland
but
as
an
english
lord
bruce
was
the
grandson
of
the
robert
bruce
of
annandale
who
had
been
promised
the
crown
by
alexander
ii
and
who
had
been
one
of
the
claimants
of
his
grandfather
had
done
homage
to
edward
and
bruce
himself
had
been
generally
on
the
english
side
and
had
fought
against
wallace
at
falkirk
when
john
balliol
had
decided
to
rebel
he
had
transferred
the
lands
of
annandale
from
the
bruces
to
the
comyns
and
they
had
been
restored
by
edward
i
after
balliol
submission
from
to
bruce
had
been
associated
with
comyn
in
the
guardianship
of
the
kingdom
but
like
comyn
had
submitted
to
edward
nobody
in
scotland
could
now
think
of
a
restoration
of
balliol
and
if
there
was
to
be
a
scottish
king
at
all
it
must
obviously
be
either
comyn
or
bruce
the
claim
of
john
comyn
the
younger
was
much
stronger
than
that
of
his
father
had
been
the
elder
comyn
had
claimed
on
account
of
his
descent
from
donald
bane
the
brother
and
successor
of
malcolm
canmore
but
the
younger
comyn
had
an
additional
claim
in
right
of
his
mother
who
was
a
sister
of
john
balliol
between
bruce
and
comyn
there
was
a
feud
in
at
a
meeting
of
the
great
council
of
scotland
at
peebles
comyn
had
attacked
bruce
and
they
could
only
be
separated
by
the
use
of
violence
on
the
february
bruce
and
the
comyn
met
in
the
church
of
the
convent
of
the
minorite
friars
at
dumfries
tradition
tells
that
they
met
to
adjust
their
conflicting
claims
with
a
view
to
establishing
the
independence
of
the
country
in
the
person
of
one
or
other
of
the
rivals
that
a
dispute
arose
in
which
they
came
to
blows
and
that
bruce
after
inflicting
a
severe
wound
upon
his
enemy
left
the
church
i
doubt
i
have
slain
the
red
comyn
he
said
to
his
followers
doubt
was
the
reply
of
sir
roger
fitzpatrick
i
mak
siccar
the
actual
circumstances
of
the
affair
are
unknown
to
us
but
bruce
may
fairly
be
relieved
of
the
suspicion
of
any
premeditation
because
it
is
most
unlikely
that
he
would
have
needlessly
chosen
to
offend
the
church
by
committing
a
murder
within
sanctuary
the
real
interest
attaching
to
the
circumstances
lies
in
the
tradition
that
the
object
of
the
meeting
was
to
organize
a
resistance
against
edward
i
whether
this
was
so
or
not
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
result
of
the
conference
compelled
the
bruce
to
place
himself
at
the
head
of
the
national
cause
a
norman
baron
born
in
england
he
was
by
no
means
the
natural
leader
for
whose
appearance
men
looked
and
there
was
a
grave
chance
of
his
failing
to
arouse
the
national
sentiment
but
the
murder
of
one
claimant
to
the
scottish
throne
at
the
hands
of
the
only
other
possible
candidate
who
thus
placed
himself
in
the
position
of
undoubted
heir
could
scarcely
have
been
forgiven
by
edward
i
even
if
the
comyn
had
not
for
the
past
two
years
proved
a
faithful
servant
of
the
english
king
there
was
no
alternative
and
on
the
march
robert
earl
of
carrick
and
lord
of
annandale
was
crowned
king
of
the
scots
at
scone
the
ancient
royal
crown
of
the
scottish
kings
had
been
removed
by
balliol
in
and
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
edward
but
the
countess
of
buchan
placed
on
the
bruce
head
a
hastily
made
coronet
of
gold
it
was
far
from
an
auspicious
beginning
it
is
difficult
to
give
bruce
credit
for
much
patriotic
feeling
although
as
we
have
seen
he
had
been
one
of
the
guardians
who
had
maintained
a
semblance
of
independence
the
death
of
the
comyn
had
thrown
against
him
the
whole
influence
of
the
church
he
was
excommunicate
and
it
was
no
sin
to
slay
him
the
powerful
family
whose
head
had
been
cut
off
by
his
hand
had
vowed
revenge
and
its
great
influence
was
on
the
side
of
the
english
it
is
no
small
tribute
to
the
force
of
the
sentiment
of
nationality
that
the
scots
rallied
round
such
a
leader
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
from
whatever
reason
the
bruce
adopted
the
national
cause
he
proved
in
every
respect
worthy
of
a
great
occasion
and
as
time
passed
he
came
to
deserve
the
place
he
occupies
as
the
hero
of
the
epic
of
a
freedom
the
first
blow
in
the
renewed
struggle
was
struck
at
methven
near
perth
where
on
the
june
the
earl
of
pembroke
inflicted
a
defeat
upon
king
robert
the
lowlands
were
now
almost
entirely
lost
to
him
he
sent
his
wife
and
child
to
kildrummie
castle
in
aberdeenshire
whence
they
fled
to
the
sanctuary
of
duthac
near
tain
in
august
bruce
was
defeated
at
dalry
by
alexander
of
lorn
a
relative
of
the
comyn
in
september
kildrummie
castle
fell
and
nigel
bruce
king
robert
brother
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
english
and
was
put
to
death
at
berwick
to
complete
the
tale
of
catastrophes
the
bruce
wife
and
daughter
two
of
his
sisters
and
other
two
of
his
brothers
along
with
the
countess
of
buchan
came
into
the
power
of
the
english
king
edward
placed
some
of
the
ladies
in
cages
and
put
to
death
sir
thomas
bruce
and
alexander
bruce
dean
of
glasgow
february
meanwhile
king
robert
had
found
it
impossible
to
maintain
himself
even
in
his
own
lands
of
carrick
and
he
withdrew
to
the
island
of
rathlin
where
he
wintered
undeterred
by
this
long
series
of
calamities
he
took
the
field
in
the
spring
of
and
now
for
the
first
time
fortune
favoured
him
on
the
may
he
defeated
the
english
under
pembroke
at
loudon
hill
in
ayrshire
he
had
been
joined
by
his
brother
edward
and
by
the
lord
james
of
douglas
the
black
douglas
and
the
news
of
his
success
slight
as
it
was
helped
to
increase
at
once
the
spirit
and
the
numbers
of
his
followers
his
position
however
was
one
of
extreme
difficulty
he
was
still
only
a
king
in
name
and
in
reality
the
leader
of
a
guerilla
warfare
edward
was
marching
northwards
at
the
head
of
a
large
army
determined
to
crush
his
audacious
subject
but
fate
had
decreed
that
the
hammer
of
the
scots
was
never
again
to
set
foot
in
scotland
at
near
carlisle
within
sight
of
his
unconquered
conquest
the
great
edward
breathed
his
last
his
death
was
the
in
the
struggle
the
reign
of
edward
ii
in
england
is
a
most
important
factor
in
the
explanation
of
bruce
success
with
the
death
of
edward
i
the
whole
aspect
of
the
contest
changes
the
english
were
no
longer
conducting
a
great
struggle
for
a
statesmanlike
ideal
as
they
had
been
under
edward
i
however
impossible
he
himself
had
made
its
attainment
there
is
no
longer
any
sign
of
conscious
purpose
either
in
their
method
or
in
their
aims
the
nature
of
the
warfare
at
once
changed
edward
ii
despite
his
father
wish
that
his
bones
should
be
carried
at
the
head
of
the
army
till
scotland
was
subdued
contented
himself
with
a
fruitless
march
into
ayrshire
and
then
returned
to
give
his
father
a
magnificent
burial
in
westminster
abbey
king
robert
was
left
to
fight
his
scottish
enemies
without
their
english
allies
these
scottish
enemies
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
the
nobles
who
had
supported
the
english
cause
more
or
less
consistently
and
the
personal
enemies
of
the
bruce
who
increased
in
numbers
after
the
murder
of
comyn
among
the
great
families
thus
alienated
from
the
cause
of
scotland
were
the
highlanders
of
argyll
and
the
isles
some
of
the
men
of
badenach
and
certain
galloway
clans
but
that
this
opposition
was
personal
and
not
racial
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
from
the
first
some
of
these
highlanders
were
loyal
to
bruce
sir
nigel
campbell
and
angus
og
we
shall
see
further
that
after
the
first
jealousies
caused
by
comyn
death
and
success
had
passed
away
the
men
of
argyll
and
the
isles
took
a
more
prominent
part
on
the
scottish
side
in
december
bruce
routed
john
comyn
the
successor
of
his
old
rival
at
slains
on
the
aberdeenshire
coast
and
in
the
following
may
when
comyn
had
obtained
some
slight
english
assistance
he
inflicted
a
final
defeat
upon
him
at
inverurie
the
power
of
the
comyns
in
their
hereditary
earldom
of
buchan
had
now
been
suppressed
and
king
robert
turned
his
attention
to
their
allies
in
the
south
in
the
autumn
of
he
himself
defeated
alexander
of
lorn
and
subdued
the
district
of
argyll
his
brother
edward
reduced
galloway
to
subjection
and
douglas
along
with
randolph
earl
of
moray
was
successful
in
tweeddale
thus
within
three
years
from
the
death
of
comyn
bruce
had
broken
the
power
of
the
great
families
whose
enmity
against
him
had
been
aroused
by
that
event
one
year
later
the
other
great
misfortune
which
had
been
brought
upon
him
by
the
same
cause
was
removed
by
an
act
which
is
important
evidence
at
once
of
the
strength
of
the
feeling
in
the
country
and
of
the
confidence
which
bruce
had
inspired
on
the
february
the
clergy
of
scotland
met
at
dundee
and
made
a
solemn
declaration
of
fealty
to
king
robert
as
their
lawful
king
scotland
was
thus
united
in
its
struggle
for
independence
under
king
robert
i
it
now
remained
to
attack
the
english
garrisons
who
held
the
castles
of
scotland
an
invasion
conducted
by
edward
ii
in
proved
fruitless
and
the
english
king
returned
home
to
enter
on
a
long
quarrel
with
the
lords
ordainers
and
to
see
his
favourite
gaveston
first
exiled
and
then
put
to
death
while
the
attention
of
the
rulers
of
england
was
thus
occupied
bruce
for
the
first
time
since
wallace
inroad
of
carried
the
war
into
the
enemy
country
invading
the
north
of
england
both
in
and
in
meanwhile
the
strongholds
of
the
country
were
passing
out
of
the
english
power
linlithgow
was
recovered
in
perth
in
january
and
roxburgh
a
month
later
the
romantic
capture
of
the
castle
of
edinburgh
by
randolph
earl
of
moray
in
march
is
one
of
the
classical
stories
of
scottish
history
and
in
the
summer
of
the
same
year
king
robert
restored
the
scottish
rule
in
the
isle
of
man
in
november
only
stirling
castle
remained
in
english
hands
and
edward
bruce
rashly
agreed
to
raise
the
siege
on
condition
that
the
garrison
should
surrender
if
they
were
not
relieved
by
june
edward
ii
determined
to
make
a
heroic
effort
to
maintain
this
last
vestige
of
english
conquest
and
his
attempt
to
do
so
has
become
irrevocably
associated
with
the
field
of
bannockburn
in
his
preparations
for
the
great
struggle
which
was
to
determine
the
fate
of
scotland
the
bruce
carefully
avoided
the
errors
which
had
led
to
wallace
defeat
at
falkirk
he
selected
a
position
which
was
covered
on
one
side
by
the
bannock
burn
and
a
morass
and
on
the
other
side
by
the
new
park
or
forest
his
front
was
protected
by
the
stream
and
by
the
famous
series
of
pottes
or
holes
covered
over
so
as
to
deceive
the
english
cavalry
the
choice
of
this
narrow
position
not
only
prevented
the
possibility
of
a
flank
attack
but
also
forced
the
great
army
of
edward
ii
into
a
small
space
where
its
numbers
became
a
positive
disadvantage
king
robert
arranged
his
infantry
in
four
divisions
in
front
were
three
schiltrons
of
pikemen
under
randolph
edward
bruce
and
sir
james
douglas
and
bruce
himself
commanded
the
reserve
which
was
composed
of
highlanders
from
argyll
and
the
islands
and
of
the
men
of
carrick
sir
robert
keith
the
marischal
was
in
charge
of
a
small
body
of
cavalry
which
did
good
service
by
driving
back
at
a
critical
moment
such
archers
as
made
their
way
through
the
forest
the
english
army
was
in
ten
divisions
but
the
limited
area
in
which
they
had
to
fight
interfered
with
their
arrangement
as
at
falkirk
the
english
cavalry
made
a
gallant
but
useless
charge
against
the
schiltrons
but
it
was
not
possible
again
to
save
the
day
by
means
of
archers
for
the
archers
had
no
room
to
deploy
and
could
only
make
vain
efforts
to
shoot
over
the
heads
of
the
horsemen
bruce
strengthened
the
scots
with
his
reserve
and
then
ensued
a
general
action
along
the
whole
line
the
van
of
the
english
army
was
now
thoroughly
demoralized
and
their
comrades
in
the
rear
could
not
in
these
narrow
limits
press
forward
to
render
any
assistance
king
robert
at
this
juncture
rushed
down
a
hill
behind
the
scottish
army
and
they
appeared
to
the
english
as
a
fresh
force
come
to
assist
the
enemy
the
result
was
the
loss
of
all
sense
of
discipline
king
edward
magnificent
host
fled
in
complete
rout
and
with
great
slaughter
and
the
cause
of
scottish
freedom
was
won
the
victory
of
bannockburn
did
not
end
the
war
for
the
english
refused
to
acknowledge
the
independence
of
scotland
and
fighting
continued
till
the
year
the
scots
not
only
invaded
england
but
adopted
the
policy
of
fighting
england
in
ireland
and
english
reprisals
in
scotland
were
uniformly
unsuccessful
bruce
invaded
england
in
in
the
same
year
his
brother
edward
landed
with
a
scottish
army
at
carrickfergus
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
a
throne
for
himself
he
was
crowned
king
of
ireland
in
may
and
during
that
and
the
following
year
king
robert
was
personally
in
ireland
giving
assistance
to
his
brother
but
in
edward
bruce
was
defeated
and
slain
near
dundalk
and
with
his
death
this
phase
of
the
bruce
english
policy
disappears
a
few
months
before
the
death
of
edward
bruce
king
robert
had
captured
the
border
town
of
which
had
been
held
by
the
english
since
in
edward
ii
sent
an
english
army
to
besiege
berwick
and
the
scots
replied
by
an
invasion
of
england
in
the
course
of
which
douglas
and
randolph
defeated
the
english
at
in
yorkshire
the
english
were
led
by
the
archbishop
of
york
and
so
many
clerks
were
killed
that
the
battle
acquired
the
name
of
the
chapter
of
mitton
the
war
lingered
on
for
three
years
more
the
year
saw
an
invasion
of
england
by
king
robert
and
a
of
scotland
by
edward
ii
who
destroyed
the
abbey
of
dryburgh
on
his
return
march
this
expedition
was
as
usual
fruitless
for
the
scots
adopted
their
usual
tactics
of
leaving
the
country
waste
and
desolate
and
the
english
army
could
obtain
no
food
in
october
of
the
same
year
king
robert
made
a
further
inroad
into
yorkshire
and
won
a
small
victory
at
biland
abbey
at
last
in
march
a
truce
was
made
for
thirteen
years
but
as
edward
ii
persisted
in
declining
to
acknowledge
the
independence
of
scotland
it
was
obvious
that
peace
could
not
be
long
maintained
during
the
fourteen
years
which
followed
his
victory
of
bannockburn
king
robert
was
consolidating
his
kingdom
he
had
obtained
recognition
even
in
the
western
highlands
and
islands
and
the
sentiment
of
the
whole
nation
had
gathered
around
him
the
force
of
this
sentiment
is
apparent
in
connection
with
ecclesiastical
difficulties
when
pope
john
xxii
attempted
to
make
peace
in
and
refused
to
acknowledge
the
bruce
as
king
the
papal
envoys
were
driven
from
the
kingdom
for
this
the
country
was
placed
under
the
papal
ban
and
when
in
the
pope
offered
both
to
acknowledge
king
robert
and
to
remove
the
excommunication
on
condition
that
berwick
should
be
restored
to
the
english
the
scots
refused
to
comply
with
his
condition
a
small
rebellion
in
had
been
firmly
repressed
by
king
and
parliament
the
birth
of
a
son
to
king
robert
on
the
march
had
given
security
to
the
dynasty
and
at
the
great
parliament
which
met
at
cambuskenneth
in
at
which
scottish
burghs
were
for
the
first
time
represented
the
clergy
the
barons
and
the
people
took
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
little
prince
david
and
should
his
heirs
fail
to
robert
the
son
of
bruce
daughter
marjorie
and
her
husband
robert
the
high
steward
of
scotland
the
same
parliament
put
the
financial
position
of
the
monarch
on
a
satisfactory
footing
by
granting
him
a
tenth
penny
of
all
rents
the
deposition
and
murder
of
edward
ii
created
a
situation
of
which
the
king
of
scots
could
not
fail
to
take
advantage
the
truce
was
broken
in
the
summer
of
by
an
expedition
into
england
conducted
by
douglas
and
randolph
and
the
hardiness
of
the
scottish
soldiery
surprised
the
english
and
warned
them
that
it
was
impossible
to
prolong
the
contest
in
the
present
condition
of
the
two
countries
the
regents
for
the
young
edward
iii
resolved
to
come
to
terms
with
bruce
the
treaty
of
northampton
dated
march
is
still
preserved
in
edinburgh
it
acknowledged
the
complete
independence
of
scotland
and
the
royal
dignity
of
king
robert
it
promised
the
restoration
of
all
the
symbols
of
scottish
independence
which
edward
i
had
removed
and
it
arranged
a
marriage
between
prince
david
the
heir
to
the
scottish
throne
and
joanna
the
sister
of
the
young
king
of
england
a
marriage
ceremony
between
the
two
children
was
solemnized
in
the
following
may
but
the
stone
of
fate
was
never
removed
from
westminster
owing
it
is
said
to
the
opposition
of
the
abbot
the
succession
of
james
vi
to
the
throne
of
england
nearly
three
centuries
later
was
accepted
as
the
fulfilment
of
the
prophecy
attached
to
the
coronation

thus
closed
the
portion
of
scottish
history
which
is
known
as
the
war
of
independence
the
condemnation
of
the
policy
of
edward
i
lies
simply
in
its
results
he
found
the
two
nations
at
peace
and
living
together
in
amity
he
left
them
at
war
and
each
inspired
with
a
bitter
hatred
of
the
other
a
policy
which
aimed
at
the
unification
of
the
island
and
at
preventing
scotland
from
proving
a
source
of
danger
to
england
and
which
resulted
in
a
warfare
covering
almost
continuously
more
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
and
which
after
the
lapse
of
four
centuries
left
the
policy
of
scotland
a
serious
difficulty
to
english
ministers
can
scarcely
receive
credit
for
practical
sagacity
however
wise
its
aim
it
created
for
england
a
relentless
and
irritating
if
not
always
a
dangerous
enemy
invariably
ready
to
take
advantage
of
english
difficulties
england
had
to
fight
scotland
in
france
and
in
ireland
and
edward
iv
and
henry
vii
found
the
king
of
scots
the
ally
of
the
house
of
lancaster
and
the
protector
of
perkin
warbeck
only
the
accident
of
the
reformation
rendered
it
possible
to
disengage
scotland
from
its
alliance
with
france
and
to
bring
about
a
union
with
england
till
the
emergence
of
the
religious
question
the
english
party
in
scotland
consisted
of
traitors
and
mercenaries
and
their
efforts
to
strengthen
english
influence
form
the
most
discreditable
pages
of
scottish
history
we
are
not
here
dealing
with
the
domestic
history
of
scotland
but
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
a
reference
to
the
subject
of
the
influence
of
the
scottish
victory
upon
the
scots
themselves
it
has
been
argued
that
bannockburn
was
for
scotland
a
national
misfortune
and
that
defeat
would
have
been
for
the
real
welfare
of
the
country
there
are
of
course
two
from
which
we
may
approach
the
question
the
apologist
of
bannockburn
might
lay
stress
on
the
different
effects
of
conquest
and
a
independence
upon
the
national
character
and
might
fairly
point
to
various
national
characteristics
which
have
been
perhaps
of
some
value
to
civilization
and
which
could
hardly
have
been
fostered
in
a
condition
of
servitude
on
the
other
hand
there
arises
a
question
as
to
material
prosperity
it
must
be
remembered
that
we
are
not
here
discussing
the
effect
of
a
peaceful
and
amicable
union
such
as
edward
first
proposed
but
of
a
successful
war
of
conquest
and
in
this
connection
it
is
only
with
thankfulness
and
gratitude
to
wallace
and
to
bruce
that
the
scotsman
can
regard
the
parallel
case
of
ireland
which
from
a
century
before
the
time
of
edward
i
had
been
annexed
by
conquest
the
story
we
have
just
related
goes
to
create
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
fate
of
scotland
could
not
have
been
different
but
further
leaving
all
such
problems
of
the
might
have
been
we
may
submit
that
the
misery
of
scotland
in
the
fourteenth
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
has
been
much
exaggerated
it
is
true
that
the
borders
were
in
a
condition
of
perpetual
feud
and
that
minorities
and
intrigues
gravely
hampered
the
progress
of
the
country
but
more
especially
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
there
are
not
wanting
indications
of
prosperity
the
chapter
of
scottish
history
which
tells
of
the
growth
of
burghs
has
yet
to
be
written
the
construction
of
magnificent
cathedrals
and
religious
houses
and
the
rise
of
three
universities
must
not
be
left
out
of
account
gifts
to
the
infant
universities
the
records
of
which
we
possess
prove
that
for
humble
folk
the
tenure
of
property
was
comparatively
secure
and
that
there
was
a
large
amount
of
comfort
among
the
people
under
james
iv
trade
and
commerce
prospered
and
the
scottish
navy
rivalled
that
of
the
tudors
the
century
in
which
scottish
prosperity
received
its
most
severe
blows
immediately
succeeded
the
union
of
the
crowns
if
for
three
hundred
years
the
civilizing
influence
of
england
can
scarcely
be
traced
in
the
history
of
scottish
progress
that
of
france
was
predominant
and
scotland
can
not
entirely
regret
the
fact
scotland
from
the
date
of
bannockburn
to
that
of
pinkie
will
not
suffer
from
a
comparison
with
the
england
which
underwent
the
strain
of
the
long
french
wars
the
civil
broils
of
lancaster
and
york
and
the
oppression
of
the
tudors
moreover
there
is
one
further
consideration
which
should
not
be
overlooked
the
postponement
of
an
english
union
till
the
seventeenth
century
enabled
scotland
to
work
out
its
own
reformation
of
religion
in
the
way
best
adapted
to
the
national
needs
and
it
is
difficult
to
estimate
from
the
material
alone
the
importance
of
this
factor
in
the
national
progress
the
inspiration
and
the
education
which
the
scottish
church
has
given
to
the
scottish
people
has
found
one
result
in
the
impulse
it
has
afforded
to
the
growth
of
material
prosperity
and
it
is
not
easy
to
regret
that
scotland
at
the
date
of
the
reformation
was
free
to
work
out
its
own
ecclesiastical
destiny

pinkerton
suggests
that
king
robert
adopted
this
arrangement
because
he
was
unable
to
trust
the
highlanders
but
this
is
unlikely
as
their
leader
angus
og
had
been
consistently
faithful
to
him
throughout
chapter
v
edward
iii
and
scotland
almost
immediately
after
the
conclusion
of
the
treaty
of
northampton
the
conditions
of
government
in
england
and
scotland
were
reversed
since
the
death
of
edward
i
scotland
under
a
strong
king
had
gained
by
the
weakness
of
the
english
sovereign
now
england
under
the
energetic
rule
of
edward
iii
was
to
profit
by
the
death
of
king
robert
and
by
the
succession
of
a
minor
on
the
june
king
robert
died
probably
a
leper
at
his
castle
of
cardross
on
the
clyde
and
left
the
scottish
throne
to
his
son
david
ii
in
october
of
the
following
year
the
young
edward
iii
of
england
threw
off
the
yoke
of
the
mortimers
and
established
his
personal
rule
and
came
almost
immediately
into
conflict
with
scotland
the
scottish
regent
was
randolph
or
ranulph
earl
of
moray
the
companion
of
bruce
and
the
black
douglas
in
the
exploits
of
the
great
war
possibly
because
edward
iii
had
afforded
protection
to
the
pretender
edward
balliol
the
eldest
son
of
john
balliol
and
had
received
him
at
the
english
court
randolph
refused
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
of
northampton
by
which
their
lands
were
to
be
restored
to
the
disinherited
to
barons
whose
property
in
scotland
had
been
forfeited
because
they
had
adopted
the
english
side
in
the
war
a
somewhat
serious
situation
was
thus
created
and
edward
not
unnaturally
took
advantage
of
it
to
disown
the
treaty
of
northampton
which
had
been
negotiated
by
the
mortimers
during
his
minority
and
which
was
extremely
unpopular
in
england
he
at
once
recognized
edward
balliol
as
king
of
scotland
the
only
defence
of
randolph
action
is
the
probability
that
he
suspected
edward
to
be
in
search
of
a
pretext
for
refusing
to
be
bound
by
a
treaty
made
in
such
circumstances
and
if
a
struggle
were
to
ensue
it
was
certainly
desirable
not
to
increase
the
power
of
the
english
party
edward
proceeded
to
assist
balliol
in
an
expedition
to
scotland
which
lang
describes
as
practically
an
filibustering
expedition
winked
at
by
the
home
government
the
filibusters
being
neither
more
nor
less
scottish
than
most
of
our
but
before
balliol
reached
scotland
the
last
of
the
paladins
whose
names
have
been
immortalized
by
the
bruce
wars
had
disappeared
from
the
scene
randolph
died
at
musselburgh
in
july
and
scotland
was
left
leaderless
the
new
regent
the
earl
of
mar
was
quite
incapable
of
dealing
with
the
situation
when
balliol
landed
at
kinghorn
in
august
he
made
his
way
unmolested
till
he
reached
the
river
earn
on
his
way
to
perth
the
regent
had
taken
up
a
position
near
dupplin
and
was
at
the
head
of
a
force
which
considerably
outnumbered
the
english
but
the
scots
had
failed
to
learn
the
lesson
taught
by
edward
i
at
falkirk
and
by
bruce
at
bannockburn
the
english
succeeded
in
crossing
the
earn
by
night
and
took
up
a
position
opposite
the
hill
on
which
the
scots
were
encamped
their
archers
were
so
arranged
as
practically
to
surround
the
scots
who
attacked
in
three
divisions
armed
with
pikes
making
no
attempt
even
to
harass
the
thin
lines
of
archers
who
were
extended
on
each
side
of
the
english
main
body
but
the
unerring
aim
of
the
archers
could
not
fail
to
render
the
scottish
attack
innocuous
the
english
stood
their
ground
while
line
after
line
of
the
scots
hurled
themselves
against
them
only
to
be
struck
down
by
the
shafts
at
last
the
attack
degenerated
into
a
complete
rout
and
the
english
made
good
their
victory
by
an
indiscriminate
massacre
the
immediate
result
of
the
battle
of
dupplin
moor
was
that
edward
i
of
scotland
entered
upon
a
reign
which
lasted
almost
exactly
twelve
weeks
he
was
crowned
at
scone
on
september
and
unreservedly
acknowledged
himself
the
vassal
of
the
king
of
england
on
the
december
the
new
king
was
at
annan
when
an
unexpected
attack
was
made
upon
him
by
a
small
force
led
very
appropriately
by
a
son
of
randolph
earl
of
moray
and
by
the
young
brother
of
the
lord
james
of
douglas
balliol
fled
to
carlisle
one
leg
booted
and
the
other
naked
and
there
awaited
the
help
of
his
liege
lord
who
prepared
to
invade
scotland
in
may
meanwhile
the
patriotic
party
had
failed
to
take
advantage
of
their
opportunity
sir
andrew
moray
of
bothwell
the
regent
chosen
to
succeed
mar
who
had
fallen
at
dupplin
had
been
captured
in
a
skirmish
near
roxburgh
either
in
november
or
in
april
and
was
succeeded
in
turn
by
sir
archibald
douglas
the
hero
of
the
annan
episode
but
destined
to
be
better
known
as
tyneman
the
unlucky
the
young
king
had
been
sent
for
safety
to
france
in
april
balliol
was
again
in
scotland
and
in
may
edward
iii
began
to
besiege
berwick
which
had
been
promised
him
by
balliol
to
defend
berwick
the
scots
were
forced
to
fight
a
pitched
battle
which
proved
a
repetition
of
dupplin
moor
berwick
had
promised
to
surrender
if
it
were
not
relieved
by
a
fixed
date
when
the
day
arrived
a
small
body
of
scots
had
succeeded
in
breaking
through
the
english
lines
and
sir
archibald
douglas
had
led
a
larger
force
to
ravage
northumberland
on
these
grounds
berwick
held
that
it
had
been
in
fact
relieved
but
edward
iii
who
lacked
his
grandfather
nice
appreciation
of
situations
where
law
and
fact
are
at
variance
replied
by
hanging
a
hostage
the
regent
was
now
forced
to
risk
a
battle
in
the
hope
of
saving
berwick
and
he
marched
southwards
towards
berwick
with
a
large
army
edward
following
the
precedent
of
dupplin
occupied
a
favourable
position
at
halidon
hill
with
his
front
protected
by
a
marsh
he
drew
up
his
line
in
the
order
that
had
been
so
successful
at
dupplin
and
the
same
result
followed
each
successive
body
of
scottish
pikemen
was
cut
down
by
a
shower
of
english
arrows
before
being
able
even
to
strike
a
blow
the
regent
was
slain
and
moray
his
companion
in
arms
fled
to
france
soon
to
return
to
strike
another
blow
for
scotland
the
victory
of
halidon
added
greatly
to
the
popularity
of
edward
iii
for
the
english
looked
upon
the
shame
of
bannockburn
as
avenged
and
they
sang
scots
out
of
berwick
and
out
of
aberdeen
at
the
burn
of
bannock
ye
were
far
too
keen
many
guiltless
men
ye
slew
as
was
clearly
seen
king
edward
has
avenged
it
now
and
fully
too
i
ween
he
has
avenged
it
well
i
ween
well
worth
the
while
i
bid
you
all
beware
of
scots
for
they
are
full
of
guile
is
now
thou
scot
that
begins
thy
care
then
boastful
thy
dwelling
is
all
bare
false
wretch
and
forsworn
whither
wilt
thou
fare
hie
thee
unto
bruges
seek
a
better
biding
there
there
wretch
shalt
thou
stay
and
wait
a
weary
while
thy
dwelling
in
dundee
is
lost
for
ever
by
thy
guile
in
scotland
the
party
of
independence
was
for
the
time
helpless
edward
and
balliol
divided
the
country
between
them
the
eight
counties
of
dumfries
roxburgh
berwick
selkirk
peebles
haddington
edinburgh
and
linlithgow
formed
the
english
king
share
of
the
spoil
along
with
a
reassertion
of
his
supremacy
over
the
rest
of
scotland
english
officers
began
to
rule
between
the
tweed
and
the
forth
but
the
cause
of
independence
was
never
really
hopeless
balliol
and
the
english
party
were
soon
weakened
by
internal
dissensions
and
the
leaders
on
the
patriotic
side
were
not
slow
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunities
thus
given
them
it
was
indeed
necessary
to
send
king
david
and
his
wife
to
france
and
they
landed
at
boulogne
in
may
but
from
france
in
return
came
the
young
earl
of
moray
who
along
with
robert
the
high
steward
son
of
marjory
bruce
and
next
heir
to
the
throne
took
up
the
duties
of
guardians
the
arrival
of
moray
gave
fresh
life
to
the
cause
but
there
is
little
interest
in
the
records
of
the
struggle
the
scots
won
two
small
successes
at
the
of
edinburgh
and
at
kilblain
but
the
victory
in
the
skirmish
at
the
august
was
more
unfortunate
than
defeat
for
it
deprived
scotland
for
some
time
of
the
services
of
the
earl
of
moray
he
had
captured
guy
de
namur
and
conducted
him
to
the
borders
and
was
himself
taken
prisoner
while
on
his
journey
northwards
sir
andrew
moray
of
bothwell
who
had
been
made
guardian
after
the
battle
of
dupplin
and
was
captured
in
april
had
now
been
ransomed
and
he
was
again
recognized
as
regent
for
david
ii
so
strong
was
the
scottish
party
that
balliol
had
to
flee
to
england
for
assistance
and
in
edward
iii
again
appeared
in
scotland
it
was
not
a
very
heroic
effort
for
the
future
victor
of
crécy
he
marched
northwards
to
elgin
and
on
his
way
home
burned
the
town
of
aberdeen
as
in
the
first
war
the
had
proved
to
be
the
death
of
edward
i
in
the
summer
of
so
now
exactly
thirty
years
later
came
another
decisive
event
in
the
autumn
of
edward
iii
first
styled
himself
king
of
france
and
the
diversion
of
his
energies
from
the
scots
to
their
french
allies
rendered
possible
the
final
overthrow
of
balliol
and
the
scottish
traitors
the
circumstances
are
however
parallel
only
to
the
extent
that
an
intervention
of
fortune
rendered
possible
the
victory
of
scottish
freedom
in
there
was
no
great
leader
the
hour
had
come
but
not
the
man
for
the
next
four
years
castle
after
castle
fell
into
scottish
hands
many
of
the
tales
are
romantic
enough
but
they
do
not
lead
to
a
bannockburn
the
only
incident
of
any
significance
is
the
defence
of
the
castle
of
dunbar
the
lord
of
dunbar
was
the
earl
of
march
whose
record
throughout
the
troubles
had
been
far
from
consistent
but
who
was
now
a
supporter
of
king
david
largely
through
the
influence
of
his
wife
famous
as
black
agnes
a
daughter
of
the
great
randolph
earl
of
moray
from
january
to
june
black
agnes
held
dunbar
against
english
assaults
by
sea
and
land
many
romantic
incidents
have
been
related
of
these
long
months
of
siege
the
stories
of
the
countess
use
of
a
to
repair
the
damage
done
by
the
english
to
the
battlements
and
of
her
prophecy
made
when
the
earl
of
salisbury
brought
a
sow
or
shed
fitted
to
protect
soldiers
in
the
manner
of
the
roman
beware
montagow
for
farrow
shall
thy
sow
and
fulfilled
by
dropping
a
huge
stone
on
the
machine
and
thus
scattering
its
occupants
the
litter
of
english
pigs
these
and
her
which
as
salisbury
said
pierce
to
the
heart
are
among
the
most
wonderful
of
historical
fairy
tales
in
the
end
the
english
had
to
raise
the
siege
came
i
early
came
i
late
i
found
agnes
at
the
gate
they
sang
as
the
explanation
of
their
failure
the
defence
of
dunbar
was
followed
by
the
surrender
of
perth
and
the
capture
of
the
castles
of
stirling
and
edinburgh
and
in
june
david
ii
returned
to
scotland
from
which
balliol
had
fled
david
was
now
seventeen
years
of
age
and
he
had
a
great
opportunity
scotland
was
again
free
and
was
prepared
to
rally
round
its
national
sovereign
and
the
son
of
the
bruce
the
english
foe
was
engaged
in
a
great
struggle
with
france
and
difficulties
had
arisen
between
the
english
king
and
his
parliament
but
the
unworthy
son
of
the
great
robert
proved
only
a
source
of
weakness
to
his
supporters
the
only
redeeming
feature
of
his
policy
is
that
it
was
at
first
inspired
by
loyalty
to
his
french
protectors
in
their
interest
he
made
in
the
year
of
the
crécy
campaign
an
incursion
into
england
thus
ending
a
truce
made
in
after
the
usual
preliminary
ravaging
he
reached
neville
cross
near
durham
in
the
month
of
october
there
he
found
a
force
prepared
to
meet
him
led
as
at
northallerton
and
at
mitton
by
the
clergy
of
the
northern
province
the
battle
was
a
repetition
of
dupplin
and
halidon
hill
and
a
rehearsal
of
homildon
and
flodden
scots
and
english
alike
were
drawn
up
in
the
usual
three
divisions
the
left
centre
and
right
being
led
respectively
on
the
one
side
by
robert
the
steward
king
david
and
randolph
and
on
the
other
by
rokeby
archbishop
neville
and
henry
percy
the
english
archers
were
as
usual
spread
out
so
as
to
command
both
the
scottish
wings
they
were
met
by
no
cavalry
charge
and
they
soon
threw
the
scottish
left
into
confusion
and
prepared
the
way
for
an
assault
upon
the
centre
randolph
was
killed
the
king
was
captured
and
for
eleven
years
he
remained
a
prisoner
in
england
meanwhile
robert
the
steward
still
the
heir
to
the
throne
for
david
had
no
children
ruled
in
scotland
there
is
reason
for
believing
that
in
david
was
allowed
to
go
to
scotland
to
raise
a
ransom
and
two
years
later
an
arrangement
was
actually
made
for
his
release
but
robert
the
steward
and
david
had
always
been
on
bad
terms
and
after
everything
had
been
formally
settled
the
scots
decided
to
remain
loyal
to
their
french
allies
hostilities
recommenced
in
august
the
scots
won
a
small
victory
at
nesbit
in
berwickshire
and
captured
the
town
of
berwick
early
in
the
following
year
it
was
retaken
by
edward
iii
who
proclaimed
himself
the
successor
of
balliol
and
mercilessly
ravaged
the
lowlands
so
great
was
his
destruction
of
churches
and
religious
houses
that
the
invasion
is
remembered
as
the
burned
candlemas
peace
was
made
in
and
david
ransom
was
fixed
at
marks
it
was
a
huge
sum
but
in
connection
with
the
efforts
made
to
raise
it
the
burgesses
acquired
some
influence
in
the
government
of
the
country
david
residence
in
france
and
in
england
had
entirely
deprived
him
of
sympathy
with
the
national
aspirations
of
his
subjects
he
loved
the
gay
court
of
edward
iii
and
the
chivalry
had
deeply
affected
him
he
hated
his
destined
successor
and
he
had
been
charmed
by
edward
personality
accordingly
we
find
him
seven
years
after
his
return
to
scotland
again
making
a
journey
to
england
it
is
a
striking
fact
that
the
son
of
the
victor
of
bannockburn
should
have
gone
to
london
to
propose
to
sell
the
independence
of
scotland
to
the
grandson
of
edward
i
the
difficulty
of
paying
the
yearly
instalment
of
his
ransom
made
a
limit
to
his
own
extravagant
expenditure
and
he
now
offered
instead
of
money
an
acknowledgment
of
either
edward
himself
or
one
of
his
sons
as
the
heir
to
the
scottish
throne
the
result
of
this
proposal
was
to
change
the
policy
of
edward
he
abandoned
the
balliol
claim
and
the
traditional
edwardian
policy
in
scotland
and
accepted
david
offer
david
returned
to
scotland
and
laid
before
his
parliament
the
less
violent
of
the
two
schemes
the
proposal
that
in
the
event
of
his
dying
childless
prince
lionel
of
england
should
succeed
to
that
said
all
his
lieges
nay
na
their
consent
wald
be
na
way
that
ony
ynglis
mannys
sone
in
to
that
honour
suld
be
done
or
succede
to
bere
the
crown
off
scotland
in
successione
sine
of
age
and
off
vertew
there
the
lauchfull
airis
appearand
ware
so
the
proposal
to
substitute
an
son
for
the
lawful
heirs
proved
utterly
futile
equally
vain
were
any
attempts
of
the
scots
to
mitigate
edward
rigour
in
the
exaction
of
the
ransom
and
edward

another
scottish
campaign
to
vindicate
his
right
as
the
successor
of
balliol
who
had
died
in
but
english
energies
were
once
more
diverted
at
a
critical
moment
the
black
prince
had
involved
himself
in
serious
troubles
in
gascony
and
england
was
called
upon
to
defend
its
conquests
in

in
a
truce
was
made
between
scotland
and
england
to
last
for
fourteen
years
david

died
unregretted
in
february
it
was
fortunate
for
scotland
that
the
miserable
seven
years
which
remained
to
edward
iii
and
the
reign
of
his
unfortunate
grandson
were
so
full
of
trouble
for
england
robert
the
steward
succeeded
his
uncle
without
much
difficulty
he
was
years
of
age
already
an
old
man
for
those
days
eight
years
the
senior
of
the
nephew
whom
he
succeeded
the
main
lines
of
the
foreign
policy
of
his
reign
may
be
briefly
indicated
but
its
chief
interest
lies
in
a
series
of
border
raids
the
story
of
which
is
too
intricate
and
of
too
slight
importance
to
concern
us
the
new
king
began
by
entering
into
an
agreement
with
france
of
a
more
definite
description
than
any
previous
arrangement
and
the
year
may
be
taken
as
marking
the
formal
inauguration
of
the
league
the
truce
with
england
was
continued
and
was
renewed
in
three
years
before
the
date
originally
fixed
for
its
expiry
the
renewal
was
necessitated
by
various
acts
of
hostility
which
had
rendered
it
in
effect
a
dead
letter
the
english
were
still
in
possession
of
such
scottish
strongholds
as
roxburgh
berwick
and
lochmaben
and
round
these
there
was
continual
warfare
the
scots
sacked
the
town
of
roxburgh
in
but
without
regaining
the
castle
and
in
they
again
obtained
possession
of
berwick
john
of
gaunt
who
had
forced
the
government
of
his
nephew
to
acknowledge
his
importance
as
a
factor
in
english
politics
was
entrusted
with
the
command
of
an
army
directed
against
scotland
he
met
the
scottish
representatives
at
berwick
which
was
again
in
english
hands
and
agreed
to
confirm
the
existing
truce
which
was
maintained
till
when
scotland
was
included
in
the
english
truce
with
france
the
truce
which
was
to
last
for
eight
months
was
negotiated
in
france
in
january
in
february
and
march
john
of
gaunt
conducted
a
ravaging
expedition
into
scotland
as
far
as
edinburgh
during
the
peasants
revolt
he
had
taken
refuge
in
scotland
and
the
chroniclers
tell
us
that
the
expedition
of
was
singularly
merciful
still
it
was
an
act
of
war
and
the
scots
may
reasonably
have
expressed
surprise
when
in
april
the
french
ambassadors
who
had
been
detained
in
england
since
february
arrived
in
edinburgh
and
announced
that
scotland
and
england
had
been
at
peace
since
january
about
the
same
time
there
occurred
two
border
forays
some
french
knights
with
their
scottish
hosts
made
an
incursion
into
england
and
the
percies
along
with
the
earl
of
nottingham
conducted
a
devastating
raid
in
scotland
laying
waste
the
lothians
about
the
date
of
both
events
there
is
some
doubt
probably
the
percy
invasion
was
in
retaliation
for
the
french
affair
but
all
the
time
the
two
countries
were
nominally
at
peace
and
it
was
not
till
may
that
they
were
technically
in
a
state
of
war
in
that
month
a
french
army
was
sent
to
aid
the
scots
and
under
the
command
of
john
de
vienne
it
took
part
in
an
incursion
on
a
somewhat
larger
scale
than
the
usual
raids
the
english
replied
in
the
month
of
august
by
an
invasion
conducted
by
richard
ii
in
person
at
the
head
of
a
large
army

the
scots
declining
a
battle

cumberland
richard
sacked
edinburgh

burned
the
great
religious
houses
of
dryburgh
melrose
and
newbattle
but
was
forced
to
retire
without
having
made
any
real
conquest
the
scots
adopted
their
invariable
custom
of
retreating
after
laying
waste
the
country
so
as
to
deprive
the
english
of
provender

impatience
of
their
french
allies

persuade
them
to
give
battle

to
him
as
to
henry

there
was
a
strong
temptation
to
acquire
popularity
by
a
spirited
foreign
policy
the
scots
hesitated
to
acknowledge
henry
as
king
of
england
and
he
in
turn
seems
to
have
resolved
upon
an
invasion
of
scotland
as
the
first
military
event
of
his
reign
he
accordingly
raised
the
old
claim
of
homage
and
marched
into
scotland
to
demand
the
fealty
of
robert
iii
and
his
barons
as
usual
we
find
in
scotland
some
malcontents
who
form
an
english
party
the
leader
of

intrigue
on
this
occasion
was
the

earl

the
son
of

the

had
married
in
february
a
daughter
of
the
earl
of
douglas
the
hereditary
foe
of
march
the
dunbar
allegiance
had
always
been
doubtful
and
it
was
only
the
influence
of
the
great
countess
that
had
brought
it
to
the
patriotic
side
in
august
henry
marched
into
scotland
and
besieged
for
three
days
the
castle
of
edinburgh
which
was
successfully
defended
by
the
regent
while
albany
was
at
the
head
of
an
army
which
made
no
attempt
to
interfere
with
henry
movements
difficulties
in
wales
now
attracted
henry
attention
and
he
left
scotland
without
having
accomplished
anything
and
leaving
the
record
of
the
mildest
and
most
merciful
english
invasion
of
scotland
the
necessities
of
his
position
in
england
may
explain
his
abstaining
from
spoiling
religious
houses
as
his
predecessors
had
done
but
the
chroniclers
tell
us
that
he
gave
protection
to
every
town
that
asked
it
while
henry
was
suppressing
the
welsh
revolt
and
negotiating
with
his
parliament
albany
and
rothesay
were
struggling
for
the
government
of
scotland
rothesay
fell
from
power
in

in
march
he
died
at
falkland
contemporary
rumour
and
subsequent
legend
attributed
his
death
to
albany
and
as
in
the
case
of
richard

the
method
of
death
was
supposed
to
be
starvation
sir
walter

told
the
story
in
fair
maid
of
albany
who
had
succeeded
him
as
regent
or
guardian
made
no
effort
to
end
the
meaningless
war
with
england
which
went
fitfully
on
an
idiot
mendicant
who
was
represented
to
be
richard
ii
gave
the
scots
their
first
opportunity
of
supporting
a
pretender
to
the
english
throne
but
the
pretence
was
too
ridiculous
to
be
seriously
maintained
the
french
refused
to
take
any
part
in
such
a
scheme
and
the
served
only
to
annoy
henry
iv
and
scarcely
gave
even
a
semblance
of
significance
to
the
war
which
really
degenerated
into
a
series
of
border
raids
one
of
which
was
of
unusual
importance
henry
had
no
intention
of
seriously
prosecuting
the
claim
of
homage
and
the
continuance
of
hostilities
is
really
explained
by
the
between
march
and
douglas
and
the
old
feud
between
the
douglases
and
the
percies
in
june
the

victory

hill
douglas
and
murdoch
stewart
the
eldest
son
of
albany
had
collected
a
large
army
and
the
incursion
was
raised
to
the
level
of
something
like
national
importance
they
marched
into
england
and
took
up
a
strong
position
on
homildon
hill
or
heugh
the
percies
under
northumberland
and
hotspur
sent
against
them
a
body
of
english
archers
who
easily
outranged
the
scottish
bowmen
and
threw
the
army
into
confusion
then
ensued
as
at
dupplin
and
halidon
hill
a
simple
massacre
murdoch
stewart
and
douglas
were
taken
captive
with
several
other
scots
lords
close
on
homildon
hill
followed
the
rebellion
of

percies
and
the
result
of
the
english
victory
at
homildon
was
merely
to
create
a
new
difficulty
for
henry
iv
the
sudden
nature
of
the
percy
revolt
is
indicated
by
the
fact
that
when
albany
marched
to
relieve
a
scottish
stronghold
which
they
were
besieging
he
found
that
the
enemy
had
entered
into
an
alliance
with
the
house
of
douglas
their
ancient
foes
and
were
turning
their
arms

dispute
was
fought
for
the
lowland
town
of
aberdeen
in
a
lowland
part
of
aberdeenshire
the
very
name
of
the
town
is
celtic
and
the
district
in
which
the
battlefield
of
harlaw
is
situated
abounds
to
this
day
in
celtic
and
not
many
miles
away
the
gaelic
tongue
may
still
be
heard
at
braemar
or
at
tomintoul
it
was
not
to
a
racial
battle
between
celt
and
saxon
that
the
earl
of
mar
and
the
provost
of
aberdeen
aided
by
the
frasers
marched
out
to
harlaw
in
july
to
meet
donald
of
the
isles
had
the
clansmen
been
victorious
there
would
certainly
have
been
a
celtic
revival
but
this
was
not
the
danger
most
dreaded
by
the
victorious
lowlanders
the
battle
of
harlaw
was
part
of
the
struggle
with
england
donald
of
the
isles
was
the
enemy
of
scottish
independence
and
his
success
would
mean
english
supremacy
he
had
taken
up
the
rôle
of
the
disinherited
of
the
preceding
century
just
as
the
earl
of
march
had
done
some
years
before
as
time
passed
and
civilization
progressed
in
the
lowlands
while
the
highlands
maintained
their
integrity
the
feeling
of
separation
grew
more
strongly
marked
and
as
the
inhabitants
of
the
lowlands
intermarried
with
french
and
english
the
differences
of
blood
became
more
evident
and
hostility
became
unavoidable
but
any
such
abrupt
racial
division
as
freeman
drew
between
the
true
scots
and
the
scottish
lowlanders
stands
much
in
need
of
proof
harlaw
was
an
incident
in
the
struggle
with
england
it
was
succeeded
in
or
by
an
unfortunate
expedition
into
england
known
as
the
foul
raid
and
after
the
foul
raid
came
the
battle
of
baugé
they
are
all
part
of
one
and
the
same
story
although
harlaw
might
seem
an
internal
complication
and
baugé
an
act
of
unprovoked
aggression
both
are
really
as
much
part
of
the
english
war
as
is
the
foul
raid
or
the
battle
of
bannockburn
itself
the
invasion
of
france
by
henry
v
reminded
the
scots
that
the
english
could
be
attacked
on
french
soil
as
well
as
in
northumberland
so
the
earl
of
buchan
a
son
of
albany
was
sent
to
france
at
the
head
of
an
army
in
answer
to
the
dauphin
request
for
help
in
march
the
scots
defeated
the
english
at
baugé
and
captured
the
earl
of
somerset
the
death
of
henry
v
in
the
following
year
and
the
difficulties
of
the
english
government
led
to
the
return
of
the
young
king
of
scots
the
regent
albany
had
been
succeeded
in
by
his
son
who
was
weak
and
incompetent
and
scotland
longed
for
its
rightful
king
james
had
been
carefully
educated
in
england
and
the
dreary
years
of
his
captivity
have
enriched
scottish
literature
by
the
more
sweet
than
ever
a
poet
heart
gave
yet
to
the
english
tongue
albany
seems
to
have
made
all
due
efforts
to
obtain
his
release
and
james
was
in
constant
communication
with
scotland
he
had
been
forced
to
accompany
henry
v
to
france
and
was
present
at
the
siege
of
melun
where
henry
refused
quarter
to
the
scottish
allies
of
france
although
england
and
scotland
were
at
war
although
constantly
complaining
of
his
imprisonment
and
of
the
treatment
accorded
to
him
in
england
james
brought
home
with
him
when
his
release
was
negotiated
in
an
english
bride
joan
beaufort
the
heroine
of
the
she
was
the
daughter
of
somerset
who
had
been
captured
at
baugé
and
of
john
of
gaunt
the
troublous
reign
of
james
i
gave
him
but
little
time
for
conducting
a
foreign
war
and
the
truce
which
was
made
when
the
king
was
ransomed
continued
till
it
had
been
suggested
that
the
peace
between
england
and
scotland
should
extend
to
the
scottish
troops
serving
in
france
but
no
such
clause
was
inserted
in
the
actual
arrangement
made
and
it
is
almost
certain
that
james
could
not
have
enforced
it
even
had
he
wished
to
do
so
he
gave
however
no
indication
of
holding
lightly
the
ties
that
bound
scotland
to
france
and
in
agreed
to
the
marriage
of
his
infant
daughter
margaret
to
the
dauphin
meanwhile
the
scottish
levies
had
been
taking
their
full
share
in
the
struggle
for
freedom
in
which
france
was
engaged
at
crevant
near
auxerre
in
july
the
earl
of
buchan
now
constable
of
france
was
defeated
by
salisbury
and
thirteen
months
later
buchan
and
the
earl
of
douglas
duke
of
touraine
fell
on
the
disastrous
field
of
verneuil
at
the
battle
of
the
herrings
an
attack
upon
a
french
convoy
carrying
lenten
food
to
the
besiegers
of
orleans
made
near
janville
in
february
the
scots
under
the
new
constable
sir
john
stewart
of
darnley
committed
the
old
error
of
halidon
and
homildon
and
their
impetuous
valour
could
not
avail
against
the
english
archers
they
shared
in
the
victory
of
pathay
gained
by
the
maid
of
orleans
in
june
almost
on
the
anniversary
of
bannockburn
and
they
continued
to
follow
the
maid
through
the
last
fateful
months
of
her
warfare
so
great
a
part
had
scotsmen
taken
in
the
french
wars
that
on
the
expiry
of
the
truce
in
the
english
offered
to
restore
not
only
roxburgh
but
also
berwick
to
scotland
but
the
french
alliance
was
destined
to
endure
for
more
than
another
century
and
james
declined
thus
bringing
about
a
slight
resuscitation
of
warlike
operations
the
scots
won
a
victory
at
piperden
near
berwick
in
or
and
in
the
summer
of
when
the
princess
margaret
was
on
her
way
to
france
to
enter
into
her
union
with
the
dauphin
the
english
made
an
attempt
to
take
her
captive
james
replied
by
an
attempt
upon
roxburgh
but
gave
it
up
without
having
accomplished
anything
and
returned
to
spend
his
last
christmas
at
perth
his
twelve
years
in
scotland
had
been
mainly
occupied
in
attempts
to
reduce
his
rebellious
subjects
especially
in
the
highlands
to
obedience
and
loyalty
and
he
had
roused
much
implacable
resentment
so
the
was
murdered
at
perth
in
february
and
his
english
widow
was
left
to
guard
her
son
the
child
sovereign
now
in
his
seventh
year
it
was
probably
under
her
influence
that
a
truce
of
nine
years
was
made
when
the
truce
came
to
an
end
scotland
was
in
the
interval
between
the
two
contests
with
the
house
of
douglas
which
mark
the
reign
of
james
ii
william
the
sixth
earl
and
his
brother
david
had
been
entrapped
and
beheaded
by
the
governors
of
the
boy
king
in
november
and
the
new
earl
james
the
gross
died
in
and
was
succeeded
by
his
son
william
the
eighth
earl
who
remained
for
some
years
on
good
terms
with
the
king
accordingly
we
find
that
when
the
english
burned
the
town
of
dunbar
in
may
douglas
replied
in
the
following
month
by
sacking
alnwick
retaliation
came
in
the
shape
of
an
assault
upon
dumfries
in
the
end
of
june
and
the
scots
with
douglas
at
their
head
burned
warkworth
in
july
the
successive
attacks
on
alnwick
and
warkworth
roused
the
percies
to
a
greater
effort
and
in
october
they
invaded
scotland
and
were
defeated
at
the
battle
of
sark
or
lochmaben
stone
in
the
league
was
strengthened
by
the
marriage
of
king
james
to
marie
of
gueldres
now
began
the
second
struggle
with
the
douglases
their
great
possessions
their
rights
as
wardens
of
the
marches
their
prestige
in
scottish
history
made
them
dangerous
subjects
for
a
weak
royal
house
since
the
death
of
the
good
lord
james
their
loyalty
to
the
kings
of
scotland
had
not
been
unbroken
and
it
is
probable
that
their
suppression
was
inevitable
in
the
interests
of
a
strong
central
government
but
the
perfidy
with
which
james
with
his
own
hand
murdered
the
earl
in
february
can
scarcely
be
condoned
and
it
has
created
a
sympathy
for
the
douglases
which
their
history
scarcely
merits
james
had
now
entered
upon
a
decisive
struggle
with
the
great
house
which
a
temporary
reconciliation
with
the
new
earl
in
only
served
to
prolong
the
quarrel
is
interesting
for
our
purpose
because
it
largely
decided
the
relations
between
scotland
and
the
rival
lines
of
lancaster
and
york
in
when
the
douglases
were
finally
suppressed
and
their
estates
were
forfeited
the
yorkists
first
took
up
arms
against
henry
vi
douglas
had
attempted
intrigues
with
the
lord
of
the
isles
with
the
lancastrians
and
with
the
yorkists
in
turn
and
about
he
came
to
an
understanding
with
the
duke
of
york
we
find
therefore
during
the
years
which
followed
the
first
battle
of
albans
a
revival
of
active
hostilities
with
england
in
james
invaded
england
and
harried
northumberland
in
the
interests
of
the
lancastrians
during
the
temporary
loss
of
power
by
the
duke
of
york
in
a
truce
was
concluded
but
it
was
broken
after
the
reconciliation
of
york
to
henry
vi
in
and
when
the
battle
of
northampton
in
july
left
the
yorkists
again
triumphant
james
marched
to
attempt
the
recovery
of
roxburgh
james
i
as
we
have
seen
had
abandoned
the
siege
of
roxburgh
castle
only
to
go
to
his
death
his
son
found
his
death
while
attempting
the
same
task
on
sunday
the
of
august
he
was
killed
by
the
bursting
of
a
cannon
the
mechanism
of
which
had
attracted
his
attention
and
made
him
according
to
pitscottie
more
curious
than
became
him
or
the
majesty
of
a
king
the
year
saw
edward
iv
placed
on
his
uneasy
throne
and
a
boy
of
ten
years
reigning
over
the
turbulent
kingdom
of
scotland
the
scots
had
regained
roxburgh
a
few
days
after
the
death
of
king
james
and
they
followed
up
their
success
by
the
capture
of
wark
but
a
greater
triumph
was
in
store
when
margaret
of
anjou
after
rescuing
her
husband
henry
vi
at
the
second
battle
of
albans
in
february
met
in
march
the
great
disaster
of
towton
she
fled
with
henry
to
scotland
where
she
had
been
received
when
preparing
for
the
expedition
which
had
proved
so
unfortunate
on
her
second
visit
she
brought
with
her
the
surrender
of
berwick
which
in
april
became
once
more
a
scots
town
and
was
represented
in
the
parliament
which
met
in
in
gratitude
for
the
gift
the
scots
made
an
invasion
of
england
in
june
and
besieged
carlisle
but
were
forced
to
retire
without
having
afforded
any
real
assistance
to
the
lancastrian
cause
there
was
now
a
division
of
opinion
in
scotland
with
regard
to
supporting
the
lancastrian
cause
the
policy
of
the
late
king
was
maintained
by
the
great
bishop
kennedy
who
himself
entertained
henry
vi
in
the
castle
of
andrews
but
the
mary
of
gueldres
was
a
niece
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
was
through
his
influence
persuaded
to
go
over
to
the
side
of
the
white
rose
while
edward
iv
remained
on
unfriendly
terms
with
louis
xi
of
france
kennedy
had
not
much
difficulty
in
resisting
the
yorkist
proclivities
of
the
and
in
keeping
scotland
loyal
to
the
red
rose
they
were
able
to
render
their
allies
but
little
assistance
and
their
opposition
gave
the
astute
edward
iv
an
opportunity
of
intrigue
john
of
the
isles
took
advantage
of
the
minority
of
james
iii
to
break
the
peace
into
which
he
had
been
brought
by
james
ii
and
the
exiled
earl
of
douglas
concluded
an
agreement
between
the
lord
of
the
isles
and
the
king
of
england
but
when
in
october
edward
iv
came
to
terms
with
louis
xi
bishop
kennedy
was
willing
to
join
mary
of
gueldres
in
deserting
the
doomed
house
of
lancaster
mary
did
not
live
to
see
the
success
of
her
policy
but
peace
was
made
for
a
period
of
fifteen
years
and
scotland
had
no
share
in
the
brief
lancastrian
restoration
of
the
threatening
relations
between
england
and
france
nearly
led
to
a
rupture
in
but
the
result
was
only
to
strengthen
the
agreement
and
it
was
arranged
that
the
infant
heir
of
james
iii
should
marry
the
princess
cecilia
edward
daughter
in
when
the
french
were
again
alarmed
by
the
diplomacy
of
edward
iv
we
find
an
outbreak
of
hostilities
the
precise
cause
of
which
is
somewhat
obscure
it
is
certain
that
edward
made
no
effort
to
preserve
the
peace
and
he
sent
in
a
fleet
to
attack
the
towns
on
the
firth
of
forth
in
revenge
for
a
border
raid
for
which
james
had
attempted
to
apologize
edward
was
unable
to
secure
the
services
of
his
old
ally
the
lord
of
the
isles
who
had
been
again
brought
into
subjection
in
the
interval
of
peace
and
who
now
joined
in
the
national
preparations
for
war
with
england
but
there
was
still
a
rebel
earl
of
douglas
with
whom
to
plot
and
edward
was
fortunate
in
obtaining
the
of
the
duke
of
albany
brother
of
james
iii
who
had
been
exiled
in
albany
and
edward
made
a
treaty
in
in
which
the
former
styled
himself
alexander
king
of
scotland
and
promised
to
do
homage
to
edward
when
he
should
obtain
his
throne
the
only
important
events
of
the
war
are
the
recapture
of
berwick
in
august
and
an
invasion
of
scotland
by
the
duke
of
gloucester
berwick
was
never
again
in
scottish
hands
albany
was
unable
to
carry
out
the
revolution
contemplated
in
his
treaty
with
edward
iv
but
he
was
reinstated
and
became
for
three
months
of
the
realm
of
scotland
in
march
he
resigned
this
office
and
after
a
brief
interval
in
which
he
was
reconciled
to
king
james
was
again
forfeited
in
july
edward
iv
had
died
on
the
of
april
and
albany
was
unable
to
obtain
any
english
aid
along
with
the
earl
of
douglas
he
made
an
attempt
upon
scotland
but
was
defeated
at
lochmaben
in
july
thereafter
both
he
and
his
ally
pass
out
of
the
story
douglas
died
a
prisoner
in
albany
escaped
to
france
where
he
was
killed
at
a
tournament
in
he
left
a
son
who
was
to
take
a
great
part
in
scottish
politics
during
the
minority
of
james
richard
iii
found
sufficient
difficulty
in
governing
england
to
prevent
his
desiring
to
continue
unfriendly
relations
with
scotland
and
he
made
on
his
accession
something
like
a
cordial
peace
with
james
iii
it
was
arranged
that
james
now
a
widower
should
marry
elizabeth
woodville
widow
of
edward
iv
and
that
his
heir
prince
james
should
marry
a
daughter
of
the
duke
of
suffolk
james
did
not
afford
richard
any
assistance
in
and
after
the
battle
of
bosworth
he
remained
on
friendly
terms
with
henry
vii
a
controversy
about
berwick
prevented
the
completion
of
negotiations
for
marriage
alliances
but
friendly
relations
were
maintained
till
the
revolution
of
in
which
james
iii
lost
his
life
both
james
and
his
rebellious
nobles
who
had
proclaimed
his
son
as
king
attempted
to
obtain
english
assistance
but
it
was
given
to
neither
side
the
new
king
james
iv
was
young
brave
and
ambitious
he
was
specially
interested
in
the
navy
and
in
the
commercial
prosperity
of
scotland
it
was
scarcely
possible
that
in
this
way
difficulties
with
england
could
be
avoided
for
henry
vii
was
engaged
in
developing
english
trade
and
encouraged
english
shipping
accordingly
we
find
that
while
the
two
countries
were
still
nominally
at
peace
they
were
engaged
in
a
naval
warfare
scotland
was
fortunate
in
the
possession
of
some
great
notable
among
whom
were
sir
andrew
wood
and
sir
andrew
barton
in
sir
andrew
wood
with
two
ships
the
and
the
inflicted
a
severe
defeat
upon
five
english
vessels
which
were
engaged
in
a
piratical
expedition
in
the
firth
of
forth
henry
vii
in
great
wrath
sent
stephen
bull
with
three
great
ships
and
to
revenge
the
honour
of
the
english
navy
and
after
a
severe
fight
bull
and
his
vessels
were
captured
by
the
scots
there
was
thus
considerable
irritation
on
both
sides
and
while
the
veteran
intriguer
the
duchess
of
burgundy
attempted
to
obtain
james
assistance
for
the
pretender
perkin
warbeck
the
of
york
henry
entered
into
a

offered
him
a

the

spanish
princess
was
already
promised

all

avoid
war
were
of
no

and
in

james
marched
into

ravaged

the

in

were
in

for
the
marriage
of
james
iv
to
margaret
tudor
polydore
virgil
tells
us
that
the
english
council
raised
the
objection
that
margaret
or
her
descendants
might
succeed
to
the
throne
of
england
if
it
should
fall
out
so
said
henry
the
realm
of
england
will
suffer
no
evil
since
it
will
not
be
the
addition
of
england
to
scotland
but
of
scotland
to
england
it
is
obvious
that
the
english
had
every
reason
for
desiring
to
stop
the
irritating
opposition
of
the
scots
which
while
it
never
seriously
endangered
the
realm
was
frequently
a
cause
of
annoyance
and
which
hampered
the
efforts
of
english
diplomacy
the
scots
on
the
other
hand
were
separated
from
the
english
by
the
memories
of
two
centuries
of
constant
warfare
and
they
were
bound
by
many
ties
to
the
enemies
of
england
the
only
king
of
scots
since
alexander
iii
who
had
been
on
friendly
terms
with
england
was
james
iii
and
his
enemies
had
used
the
fact
as
a
weapon
against
him
his
successor
had
already
twice
refused
the
proffered
english
alliance
and
when
he
at
length
accepted
persistent
proposal
and
the
english
princess
it
was
only
after
much
hesitation
and
upon
certain
strict
conditions
no
englishmen
were
to
enter
scotland
without
letters
commendatory
of
their
own
sovereign
lord
or
safe
conduct
of
his
warden
of
the
marches
the
marriage
though
not
especially
flattering
to
the
dignity
of
a
monarch
who
had
been
encouraged
to
hope
for
the
hand
of
a
daughter
of
spain
was
notable
as
involving
a
recognition
the
first
since
the
treaty
of
northampton
of
the
king
of
scots
as
an
independent
sovereign
on
the
of
august
margaret
was
married
to
james
in
the
chapel
of
holyrood
she
was
received
with
great
rejoicing
the
poet
dunbar
whom
a
recent
visit
to
london
had
convinced
that
the
english
capital
with
its
beryl
streamis
pleasant
where
many
a
swan
doth
swim
with
wingis
fair
was
the
flower
of

all
wrote
the
poem
on
the
union
of
the
thistle
and
the
rose
to
welcome
this
second
english
margaret
to
scotland
but
the
time
was
not
yet
ripe
for
any
real
union
of
the
thistle
and
the
rose
peace
continued
till
the
death
of
henry
vii
but
during
these
years
england
was
never
at
war
with
france
james
threatened
war
with
england
in
april
in
the
interests
of
the
duke
of
gueldres
in
he
declined
to
give
an
understanding
that
he
would
not
renew
the
old
league
with
france
and
he
refused
to
be
drawn
by
pope
julius
ii
into
an
attitude
of
opposition
to
that
country
even
before
the
death
of
henry
vii
in
there
were
troubles
with
regard
to
the
borders
and
it
was
evident
that
the
perpetual
peace
arranged
by
the
treaty
of
marriage
was
a
sheer
impossibility
henry
viii
succeeded
to
the
throne
of
england
in
april
three
years
and
five
months
later
in
september
was
fought
the
battle
of
flodden
the
causes
may
soon
be
told
they
fall
under
three
heads
james
and
henry
were
alike
headstrong
and
impetuous
and
they
were
alike
ambitious
of
playing
a
considerable
part
in
european
affairs
they
were
moreover
and
in
the
division
of
the
inheritance
of
henry
vii
the
king
of
england
had
with
characteristic
tudor
avarice
retained
jewels
and
other
property
which
had
been
left
to
his
sister
the
queen
of
scots
in
the
second
place
the
ancient
jealousies
were
again
roused
by
disputes
on
the
borders
and
by
naval
warfare
james
had
long
been
engaged
in
the
building
of
a
fleet
for
the
protection
of
our
shores
in
he
had
built
the
for
which
it
was
said
the
woods
of
fife
had
been
wasted
the
scottish
fleet
was
frequently
involved
in
quarrels
with
henry
ships
and
in
august
the
english
took
two
scottish
vessels
which
they
alleged
to
be
pirates
and
andrew
barton
was
slain
in
the
fighting
james
demanded
redress
but
says
hall
the
king
of
england
wrote
with
brotherly
salutations
to
the
king
of
scots
of
the
robberies
and
evil
doings
of
andrew
barton
and
that
it
became
not
one
prince
to
lay
a
breach
of
a
league
to
another
prince
in
doing
justice
upon
a
pirate
or
thief
these
personal
irritations
and
petty
troubles
might
have
proved
harmless
and
had
no
european
complications
intervened
it
is
possible
that
there
might
have
from
fate
dark
book
a
leaf
been
torn
the
leaf
which
tells
of
flodden
field
but
in
julius
ii
formed
the
holy
league
against
france
and
by
the
end
of
the
year
it
included
spain
austria
and
england
the
formation
of
a
united
europe
against
the
ancient
ally
of
scotland
thoroughly
alarmed
james
it
was
true
that
at
the
moment
england
was
willing
to
be
friendly
but
should
france
be
subdued
whither
might
scotland
look
for
help
in
the
future
james
used
every
effort
to
prevent
the
league
from
carrying
out
their
project
he
attempted
to
form
a
coalition
of
denmark
france
and
scotland
and
wrote
to
his
uncle
the
king
of
denmark
urging
him
to
declare
for
the
most
christian
king
he
wrote
henry
offering
to
pardon
all
the
damage
done
to
us
and
our
kingdom
the
capture
of
our
merchant
ships
the
slaughter
and
imprisonment
of
our
subjects
if
only
henry
would
maintain
the
universal
concord
of
the
church
he
made
a
vigorous
appeal
to
the
pope
himself
beseeching
him
to
keep
the
peace
his
efforts
were
of
course
futile
nor
was
france
in
such
extreme
danger
as
he
supposed
but
the
chance
of
proving
himself
the
saviour
of
france
appealed
strongly
to
him
and
when
there
came
to
him
in
the
spring
of
a
message
from
the
queen
of
france
couched
in
the
bygone
language
of
chivalry
and
urging
him
as
her
knight
to
break
a
lance
for
her
on
english
soil
james
could
no
longer
hesitate
henry
persevered
in
his
warlike
measures
against
france
and
james
after
one
more
despairing
effort
to
act
as
mediator
began
his
preparations
for
an
invasion
of
england
his
wisest
counsellors
were
strongly
opposed
to
war
most
prominent
among
them
was
his
father
faithful
servant
bishop
elphinstone
the
founder
of
the
university
of
aberdeen
elphinstone
was
a
saint
a
scholar
and
a
statesman
and
he
was
probably
the
only
man
in
scotland
who
could
influence
the
king
during
the
discussion
of
the
french
alliance
he
urged
delay
but
was
overborne
by
the
impetuous
patriotism
of
the
younger
nobles
whose
voice
was
as
ever
for
war
so
war
it
was
bitter
letters
of
defiance
passed
between
the
two
kings
and
in
august
james
led
his
army
over
the
border
lowlanders
highlanders
and
islesmen
had
alike
rallied
round
his
banner
once
again
we
find
the
true
scots
leagued
not
with
but
against
the
saxons
farther
off
the
scots
took
norham
castle
and
some
neighbouring
strongholds
to
prevent
their
affording
protection
to
the
english
and
then
occupied
a
strong
position
on
flodden
edge
the
earl
of
surrey
who
was
in
command
of
the
english
army
challenged
james
to
a
pitched
battle
and
james
accepted
the
challenge
meanwhile
surrey
completely
outmanoeuvred
the
king
of
scots
crossing
the
till
and
marching
northwards
so
as
to
get
between
james
and
scotland
james
seems
to
have
been
quite
unsuspicious
of
this
movement
which
was
protected
by
some
rising
ground
the
scots
had
failed
to
learn
the
necessity
of
scouting
surrey
when
he
had
gained
his
end
recrossed
the
till
and
made
a
march
directly
southwards
upon
flodden
james
can
not
have
been
afraid
of
losing
his
communications
for
his
force
was
and
surrey
was
bound
by
the
terms
of
his
own
challenge
to
fight
immediately
but
he
decided
to
abandon
flodden
edge
for
the
lower
ridge
of
brankston
and
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
which
not
only
rendered
the
scots
invisible
to
the
enemy
but
likewise
concealed
the
enemy
from
the
scots
king
james
and
his
army
rushed
upon
the
english
the
battle
began
with
artillery
the
superiority
of
the
english
in
which
forced
the
scots
to
come
to
close
quarters
then
far
on
the
left
unseen
the
while
stanley
broke
lennox
and
argyle
on
the
english
right
sir
edmund
howard
fell
back
before
the
charge
of
the
scottish
borderers
who
forthwith
devoted
themselves
to
plunder
the
centre
was
fiercely
contested
the
lord
high
admiral
of
england
a
son
of
surrey
defeated
crawford
and
montrose
and
attacked
the
division
with
which
james
himself
was
encountering
surrey
while
the
archers
on
the
left
of
the
english
centre
rendered
unavailing
the
brave
charge
of
the
highlanders
with
artillery
and
with
archery
the
english
had
drawn
the
scottish
attack
and
the
battle
of
flodden
was
but
a
variation
on
every
fight
since
dupplin
moor
finally
the
scots
formed
themselves
into
a
ring
of
spearmen
and
the
english
with
their
arrows
and
their
long
bills
kept
up
a
continuous
attack
the
story
has
been
told
once
for
all
but
yet
though
thick
the
shafts
as
snow
though
charging
knights
as
whirlwinds
go
though
ply
the
ghastly
blow
unbroken
was
the
ring
the
stubborn
spearmen
still
made
good
their
dark
impenetrable
wood
each
stepping
where
their
comrade
stood
the
instant
that
he
fell
no
thought
was
there
of
dastard
flight
link
in
the
serried
phalanx
tight
groom
fought
like
noble
squire
like
knight
as
fearlessly
and
well
till
utter
darkness
closed
her
wing
their
thin
host
and
wounded
king
no
defeat
had
ever
less
in
it
of
disgrace
the
victory
of
the
english
was
hard
won
and
the
valour
displayed
on
the
stricken
field
saved
scotland
from
any
further
results
of
surrey
triumph
the
results
were
severe
enough
although
the
scots
could
boast
of
their
dead
king
that
no
one
failed
him
he
is
keeping
royal
state
and
semblance
still
they
had
lost
the
best
and
bravest
of
the
land
scarcely
a
family
record
but
tells
of
an
ancestor
slain
at
flodden
and
many
laments
have
come
down
to
us
for
the
flowers
of
the
forest
but
although
the
disaster
was
overwhelming
and
the
loss
seemed
irreparable
at
the
time
though
the
defeat
at
flodden
was
not
less
decisive
than
the
victory
of
bannockburn
the
name
of
flodden
notwithstanding
all
this
recalls
but
an
incident
in
our
annals
bannockburn
is
an
incident
in
english
history
but
it
is
the
great
in
the
story
of
scotland
the
historian
can
not
regard
flodden
as
more
than
incidental
to
both
when
james
v
succeeded
his
father
he
was
but
one
year
old
and
his
guardian
in
accordance
with
the
desire
of
james
iv
was
the
margaret
tudor
her
subsequent
career
is
one
long
tale
of
intrigue
too
elaborate
and
intricate
to
require
a
full
recapitulation
here
the
war
lingered
on
in
a
desultory
fashion
till
may
lord
dacre
ravaged
the
borders
and
the
scots
replied
by
a
raid
into
england
but
there
is
nothing
of
any
interest
to
relate
from
the
accession
of
francis
i
in
the
condition
of
politics
in
scotland
as
of
all
europe
was
influenced
and
at
times
dominated
by
his
rivalry
with
the
emperor
the
unwonted
desire
of
france
for
peace
and
alliance
with
england
placed
the
scots
in
a
position
of
considerable
difficulty
and
the
difficulty
was
accentuated
by
the
more
than
usually
distracted
state
of
the
country
during
the
minority
of
the
king
in
august
margaret
who
had
in
the
preceding
april
given
birth
to
a
posthumous
child
to
james
iv
was
married
to
the
earl
of
angus
the
grandson
of
archibald
it
was
felt
that
the
sister
of
henry
viii
and
the
wife
of
a
douglas
could
scarcely
prove
a
suitable
guardian
of
a
stewart
throne
and
the
scots
invited
the
duke
of
albany
son
of
the
traitor
duke
and
cousin
of
the
late
king
to
come
over
to
scotland
and
undertake
the
government
despite
some
efforts
of
henry
to
prevent
him
albany
came
to
scotland
in
may
he
was
a
french
nobleman
possessed
large
estates
in
france
and
although
he
was
ere
long
to
the
scottish
throne
could
speak
no
language
but
french
when
he
arrived
in
scotland
he
found
against
him
the
party
of
margaret
and
angus
while
the
earls
of
lennox
and
arran
were
his
ardent
supporters
the
latter
nobleman
was
the
grandson
of
james
ii
being
the
son
of
the
princess
mary
and
james
lord
hamilton
and
he
was
therefore
the
next
heir
to
the
throne
after
albany
the
interests
of
both
might
be
endangered
should
margaret
and
angus
become
and
so
we
find
them
acting
together
for
some
time
albany
was
immediately
made
regent
of
scotland
and
the
care
of
the
young
king
and
his
brother
the
baby
duke
of
ross
was
entrusted
to
him
it
required
force
to
obtain
possession
of
the
children
but
the
regent
succeeded
in
doing
so
in
august
in
time
to
defeat
a
scheme
of
henry
viii
for
kidnapping
the
princes
the
fled
to
england
where
in
october
she
bore
to
angus
a
daughter
margaret
afterwards
countess
of
lennox
and
mother
of
the
unfortunate
darnley
she
then
proceeded
to
pay
a
visit
to
henry
viii
meanwhile
in
scotland
albany
was
finding
many
difficulties
arran
was
now
in
rebellion
against
him
and
now
in
alliance
with
him
in
may
angus
himself
leaving
his
imperious
wife
in
england
made
terms
with
the
regent
the
infant
duke
of
ross
had
died
in
the
end
of
and
only
the
boy
king
stood
between
albany
and
the
throne
in
albany
returned
to
france
to
cement
more
closely
the
old
alliance
and
remained
in
france
till
margaret
immediately
returned
to
scotland
and
had
she
behaved
with
any
degree
of
wisdom
might
have
greatly
strengthened
her
brother
tortuous
scottish
policy
but
a
tudor
and
a
douglas
could
not
be
other
than
an
pair
and
margaret
was
already
tired
of
her
husband
in
she
informed
her
brother
that
she
desired
to
divorce
angus
henry
whose
own
matrimonial
adventures
were
still
in
the
future
and
to
whom
angus
was
useful
scolded
his
sister
in
true
tudor
fashion
and
told
her
that
alike
by
the
laws
of
god
and
man
she
must
stick
to
her
husband
a
formal
reconciliation
took
place
but
henceforth
margaret
one
desire
was
to
be
free
and
to
this
she
subordinated
all
other
considerations
in
she
came
to
an
understanding
with
arran
her
bitterest
foe
and
in
the
summer
of
the
same
year
we
find
henry
marvelling
much
at
the
tender
letters
she
sent
to
france
in
which
she
urged
the
return
of
albany
whose
absence
from
scotland
had
been
the
main
aim
of
english
policy
since
flodden
while
francis
i
and
henry
viii
were
on
good
terms
albany
was
detained
in
france
but
when
in
their
relations
became
strained
he
returned
to
scotland
to
find
angus
in
power
scotland
rallied
round
him
and
in
february
angus
in
turn
retired
to
france
while
henry
viii
devoted
his
energies
to
the
prevention
of
a
marriage
between
his
amorous
sister
and
the
handsome
albany
the
regent
led
an
army
to
the
borders
and
began
to
organize
an
invasion
for
which
the
north
of
england
was
but
was
outwitted
by
henry
agent
lord
dacre
who
arranged
an
armistice
which
he
had
no
authority
to
conclude
albany
then
returned
to
france
and
the
scots
refusing
henry
offer
of
peace
had
to
suffer
an
invasion
by
surrey
which
was
encouraged
by
margaret
who
was
again
on
the
english
side
when
albany
came
back
in
september
he
easily
won
over
the
fickle
queen
but
after
an
unsuccessful
attack
on
wark
he
left
scotland
for
ever
in
may
no
sooner
had
albany
disappeared
from
the
scene
than
margaret
entered
into
a
new
intrigue
with
the
earl
of
arran
it
had
one
important
result
the
erection
of
the
young
king
who
now
at
the
age
of
twelve
years
became
the
nominal
ruler
of
the
country
this
manoeuvre
was
executed
with
the
connivance
of
the
english
to
whose
side
margaret
had
again
deserted
for
some
time
arran
and
margaret
remained
at
the
head
of
affairs
but
the
return
of
the
earl
of
angus
at
once
drove
the
into
the
opposite
camp
and
she
became
reconciled
to
the
leader
of
the
french
party
archbishop
beaton
whom
she
had
imprisoned
shortly
before
angus
who
had
been
the
paid
servant
of
england
throughout
all
changes
since
assumed
the
government
the
alliance
between
england
and
france
which
followed
the
disaster
to
francis
i
at
pavia
seriously
weakened
the
supporters
of
french
influence
in
scotland
and
angus
made
a
three
years
truce
in
in
the
next
year
arran
transferred
his
support
to
angus
who
held
the
reins
of
power
till
the
summer
of
the
chief
event
of
this
period
is
the
divorce
of
queen
margaret
who
immediately
married
a
youth
henry
stewart
son
of
lord
evandale
and
afterwards
known
as
lord
methven
the
fall
of
angus
was
brought
about
by
the
conduct
of
the
young
king
himself
who
tired
of
the
tyranny
in
which
he
was
held
and
escaping
from
edinburgh
to
stirling
regained
his
freedom
angus
had
to
flee
to
england
and
james
passed
under
the
influence
of
his
mother
and
her
youthful
husband
in
he
made
a
truce
with
england
for
five
years
during
these
years
james
showed
leanings
towards
the
french
alliance
while
henry
was
engaged
in
treasonable
intrigues
with
scottish
nobles
and
in
fomenting
border
troubles
but
the
truce
was
renewed
in
and
a
more
definite
peace
was
made
in
henry
now
attempted
to
enlist
james
as
an
ally
against
rome
and
by
the
irony
of
fate
offered
him
as
a
temptation
to
become
a
protestant
the
hand
of
the
princess
mary
james
refused
to
break
with
the
pope
and
negotiations
for
a
meeting
between
the
two
kings
fell
through
fortunately
for
henry
was
prepared
to
kidnap
james
the
king
of
scots
arranged
in
to
marry
a
daughter
of
the
duc
de
vendome
but
on
seeing
her
behaved
much
as
henry
viii
was
to
do
in
the
case
of
anne
of
cleves
except
that
he
definitely
declined
to
wed
her
at
all
being
in
france
he
made
a
proposal
for
the
princess
madeleine
daughter
of
francis
i
and
was
married
to
her
in
january
this
step
naturally
annoyed
henry
who
refused
james
a
passport
through
england
on
the
ground
that
no
scottish
king
had
ever
entered
england
peacefully
except
as
a
vassal
so
james
returned
by
sea
with
his
dying
bride
and
reached
scotland
to
find
numerous
troubles
in
store
for
him
among
them
intrigues
brought
about
by
his
mother
wish
to
obtain
a
divorce
from
her
third
husband
madeleine
died
in
july
and
the
relations
between
james
and
henry
viii
now
a
widower
by
the
death
of
jane
seymour
were
further
strained
by
the
fact
that
nephew
and
uncle
alike
desired
the
hand
of
mary
of
guise
widow
of
the
duke
de
longueville
who
preferred
her
younger
suitor
and
married
him
in
the
following
summer
these
two
french
marriages
are
important
as
marking
james
final
rejection
of
the
path
marked
out
for
him
by
henry
viii
the
husband
of
a
guise
could
scarcely
remain
on
good
terms
with
the
heretic
king
of
england
but
henry
with
true
tudor
persistency
did
not
give
up
hope
of
bending
his
nephew
to
his
will
and
spent
the
next
few
years
in
negotiating
with
james
in
trying
to
alienate
him
from
cardinal
beaton
the
great
supporter
of
the
french
alliance
and
in
urging
the
king
of
scots
to
enrich
himself
at
the
expense
of
the
church
as
late
as
a
meeting
was
arranged
at
york
whither
henry
went
to
find
that
his
nephew
did
not
appear
james
was
probably
wise
for
we
know
that
henry
would
not
have
scrupled
to
seize
his
person
border
troubles
arose
henry
reasserted
the
old
claim
of
homage
and
devised
a
scheme
to
kidnap
james
finally
he
sent
the
earl
of
angus
who
had
been
living
in
england
with
a
force
to
invade
scotland
and
this
without
the
formality
of
declaring
war
henry
in
fact
was
acting
as
a
suzerain
punishing
a
vassal
who
had
refused
to
appear
when
he
was
summoned
the
english
ravaged
the
county
of
roxburgh
in
the
scottish
nobles
declined
to
cross
the
border
in
what
they
asserted
to
be
a
french
quarrel
and
in
november
a
small
scottish
force
was
enclosed
between
solway
moss
and
the
river
esk
and
completely
routed
the
ignominy
of
this
fresh
disaster
broke
the
king
heart
on
december
was
born
the
hapless
princess
who
is
known
as
queen
of
scots
the
news
brought
small
comfort
to
the
dying
king
who
was
still
mourning
the
sons
he
had
lost
in
the
preceding
year
he
said
it
came
with
a
lass
and
it
will
pass
with
a
lass
and
so
adds
pitscottie
he
recommended
himself
to
the
mercy
of
almighty
god
and
spake
little
from
that
time
forth
but
turned
his
back
unto
his
lords
and
his
face
unto
the
wall
six
days
later
the
end
came
with
a
little
smile
of
laughter
and
kissing
his
hand
to
the
nobles
who
stood
round
he
breathed

for

a

was
left
the
sole

of

fortunately
margaret

had
predeceased
her

in
october
and
her
death
left
one
disturbing
element
the
less
but
the
situation
which
the
dowager
had
to
face
was
much
more
perplexed
than
that
which
confronted
any
other
of
the
long
line
of
scottish
during
the
reign
of
james
v
the
reformed
doctrines
had
been
rapidly
spreading
in
scotland
it
was
at
one
time
possible
that
james
v
might
follow
the
example
of
henry
viii
and
a
considerable
section
of
his
subjects
would
have
welcomed
the
change
his
death
added
recruits
to
the
protestant
cause
the
greater
nobles
now
strongly
desired
an
alienation
of
church
property
because
they
could
take
advantage
of
the
royal
minority
to
seize
it
for
their
private
advantage
the
english
party
no
longer
consisted
only
of
outlawed
traitors
there
were
many
honest
scots
who
felt
that
alliance
with
a
protestant
kingdom
must
replace
the
old
french
league
the
main
interest
had
come
to
be
not
nationality
but
religion
and
scotland
must
decide
between
france
and
england
the
sixteenth
century
had
already
in
spite
of
all
that
had
passed
made
it
evident
that
scots
and
english
could
live
on
terms
of
peace
and
the
reign
of
james
iv
which
had
witnessed
the
first
attempt
at
a
perpetual
alliance
was
remembered
as
the
golden
age
of
scottish
prosperity
the
was
by
birth
and
by
education
committed
to
the
maintenance
of
the
old
religion
and
of
the
french
alliance
the
task
was
indeed
difficult
ultimate
success
was
rendered
impossible
by
causes
over
which
she
possessed
no
kind
of
control
a
temporary
victory
was
rendered
practicable
only
by
the
folly
of
henry
viii
the
history
of
henry
intrigues
becomes
at
this
point
very
intricate
and
we
must
be
content
with
a
mere
outline
on
james
death
he
conceived
the
plan
of
seizing
the
scottish
throne
and
for
this
purpose
he
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
scottish
prisoners
taken
at
solway
moss
they
professed
themselves
willing
to
seize
mary
and
cardinal
beaton
and
so
to
deprive
the
national
party
of
their
leaders
then
came
the
news
that
the
earl
of
arran
had
been
appointed
regent
in
december
he
was
to
the
throne
and
so
was
unlikely
to
acquiesce
in
henry
scheme
and
the
traitors
were
instructed
to
deal
with
him
as
they
thought
necessary
but
the
traitors
who
had
of
course
been
joined
by
the
earl
of
angus
proved
false
to
henry
and
were
falsely
true
to
scotland
they
imprisoned
beaton
but
did
not
deliver
him
up
to
the
english
and
they
came
to
terms
with
arran
nor
did
they
carry
out
henry
projects
further
than
to
permit
the
circulation
of
haly
write
baith
the
new
testament
and
the
auld
in
the
vulgar
toung
and
to
enter
into
negotiations
for
the
marriage
of
the
young
queen
to
the
prince
of
wales
afterwards
edward
vi
the
conditions
they
made
were
widely
different
from
those
suggested
by
henry
full
precautions
were
taken
to
secure
the
independence
of
the
country
both
during
minority
and
for
the
future
strongholds
were
to
be
retained
in
scottish
hands
should
there
be
no
child
of
the
marriage
the
union
would
determine
and
the
proper
heir
would
succeed
to
the
scottish
throne
in
any
case
no
union
of
the
kingdoms
was
contemplated
although
the
crowns
might
be
united
these
terms
were
slightly
modified
in
the
following
may
beaton
who
had
escaped
to
andrews
did
not
oppose
the
treaty
but
made
preparations
for
war
the
treaty
was
agreed
to
and
the
war
of
intrigues
went
on
henry
offering
almost
any
terms
for
the
possession
of
the
little
queen
finally
in
september
arran
joined
the
cardinal
became
reconciled
to
the
church
and
left
henry
to
intrigue
with
the
earl
of
lennox
the
next
heir
after
arran
hostilities
broke
out
in
the
end
of
when
the
scots
enraged
by
henry
having
attacked
some
scottish
shipping
declared
the
treaty
annulled
in
the
spring
of
the
earl
of
hertford
conducted
his
expedition
into
scotland
the
english
wooing
as
it
was
called
took
the
form
of
a
massacre
without
regard
to
age
or
sex
the
instructions
given
to
hertford
by
henry
and
his
council
read
like
quotations
from
the
book
of
joshua
he
was
to
leave
none
remaining
where
he
encountered
any
resistance
hertford
abandoning
the
usual
methods
of
english
invaders
came
by
sea
took
leith
burned
edinburgh
and
ravaged
the
lothians
lennox
attempted
to
give
up
dumbarton
to
the
english
but
his
treachery
was
discovered
and
he
fled
to
england
where
he
married
margaret
the
daughter
of
angus
and
niece
of
henry
viii
by
whom
he
became
in
the
father
of
henry
stewart
lord
darnley
who
thus
stood
within
the
possibility
of
succession
in
his
own
right
to
both
kingdoms
angus
and
his
brother
sir
george
douglas
seized
the
opportunity
given
them
by
the
misery
caused
by
the
english
atrocities
to
make
a
move
against
arran
and
beaton
and
seized
the
person
of
the
but
their
success
was
brought
to
an
end
by
the
meeting
of
a
parliament
summoned
by
arran
in
december
and
the
douglases
were
reconciled
and
restored
to
their
estates
deeming
this
the
most
profitable
step
for
themselves
their
breach
with
henry
was
widened
by
the
events
of
the
next
two
months
a
body
of
englishmen
under
sir
ralph
eure
defeated
arran
at
melrose
and
desecrated
the
abbey
the
sepulchre
of
the
douglas
family
in
revenge
angus
along
with
arran
fell
upon
the
english
at
ancrum
moor
in
roxburghshire
and
inflicted
on
them
a
total
defeat
this
was
followed
by
a
second
invasion
of
hertford
this
time
by
land
he
ravaged
the
borders
in
merciless
fashion
a
by
an
army
of
scots
and
french
auxiliaries
had
proved
futile
owing
to
the
incompetence
or
the
treachery
of
angus
who
almost
immediately
returned
to
the
english
side
about
the
same
time
a
descendant
of
the
lord
of
the
isles
whom
james
iv
had
crushed
made
an
agreement
with
henry
but
was
of
little
use
to
his
cause
beaton
after
some
successful
fighting
on
the
borders
in
the
end
of
went
to
andrews
in
the
beginning
of
on
the
march
george
wishart
who
had
been
condemned
on
a
charge
of
heresy
was
hanged
and
his
body
was
burned
at
the
stake
on
may
the
more
fierce
section
of
the
protestant
party
took
their
revenge
by
murdering
the
great
cardinal
in
cold
blood
we
are
not
here
concerned
with
beaton
private
character
or
with
his
treatment
of
heretics
his
public
actions
as
far
as
foreign
relations
are
concerned
are
marked
by
a
consistent
patriotic
aim
he
represented
the
long
line
of
scottish
churchmen
who
had
striven
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
kingdom
and
the
alliance
with
france
he
had
shown
great
ability
and
tact
and
in
politics
he
had
been
much
more
honest
than
his
opponents
but
for
his
support
of
the
in
and
but
for
his
maintaining
the
party
to
which
arran
afterwards
attached
himself
it
is
possible
that
scotland
might
have
passed
under
the
yoke
of
henry
viii
in
instead
of
being
peacefully
united
to
england
sixty
years
later
with
him
disappeared
any
remaining
hope
of
the
french
party
we
may
say
of
old
catholic
scotland
writes
lang
as
said
the
dying
cardinal
all
is
gone
though
beaton
was
dead
the
effects
of
his
work
remained
he
had
saved
the
situation
at
the
crisis
of
december
and
the
insensate
cruelty
of
henry
viii
had
made
it
impossible
that
the
cardinal
work
should
fall
to
pieces
at
once
it
seemed
at
first
as
if
the
only
difference
was
that
the
castle
of
andrews
was
held
by
the
english
party
ten
months
after
beaton
death
the
small
protestant
garrison
was
joined
by
john
knox
who
was
present
when
the
regent
succeeded
with
help
from
france
in
reducing
the
castle
in
july
its
defenders
including
knox
were
sent
as
to
france
henry
viii
had
died
in
the
preceding
january
but
hertford
now
protector
somerset
continued
the
scottish
policy
of
the
preceding
reign
in
the
summer
of
he
made
his
third
invasion
of
scotland
marked
by
the
usual
barbarity
in
the
course
of
it
on
september
was
fought
the
last
battle
between
scots
and
english
somerset
met
the
scots
under
arran
at
pinkiecleuch
near
edinburgh
and
by
the
combined
effect
of
artillery
and
a
cavalry
charge
completely
defeated
them
with
great
slaughter
the
english
after
some
further
devastation
returned
home
and
the
scots
at
once
entered
into
a
treaty
with
france
which
had
been
at
war
with
england
since
it
was
agreed
that
the
young
queen
should
marry
the
dauphin
the
eldest
son
of
henry
ii
while
negotiations
were
in
progress
she
was
placed
for
safety
first
in
the
priory
of
inchmahome
an
island
in
the
lake
of
menteith
and
afterwards
in
dumbarton
castle
in
june
a
large
number
of
french
auxiliaries
were
sent
to
scotland
and
in
the
beginning
of
august
mary
was
sent
to
france
the
english
failed
to
capture
her
and
she
landed
about
august
the
war
lingered
on
till
the
scots
gradually
won
back
the
strongholds
which
had
been
seized
by
the
english
and
although
their
french
allies
did
good
service
serious
jealousies
arose
which
greatly
weakened
the
position
of
the
french
party
finally
scotland
was
included
in
the
peace
made
between
england
and
france
in
all
the
time
the
reformed
faith
was
rapidly
gaining
adherents
and
when
in
april
the
succeeded
arran
now
duke
of
chatelherault
as
regent
she
found
the
problem
of
governing
scotland
still
more
difficult
the
relations
with
england
had
indeed
been
simplified
by
the
accession
of
a
roman
catholic
queen
in
england
but
the
spanish
marriage
of
mary
tudor
made
it
difficult
for
a
guise
to
obtain
any
help
from
her
she
continued
the
policy
of
obtaining
french
levies
and
the
irritation
they
caused
was
a
considerable
help
to
her
opponents
knox
had
returned
to
scotland
in
and
except
for
a
visit
to
geneva
in
spent
the
rest
of
his
life
in
his
native
country
in
was
formed
the
powerful
assembly
of
protestant
clergy
and
laymen
who
took
the
title
of
the
congregation
of
the
lord
and
signed
the
national
covenant
which
aimed
at
the
abolition
of
roman
catholicism
their
hostility
to
the
was
intensified
by
the
events
of
the
year
in
april
queen
mary
was
married
to
the
dauphin
and
her
husband
received
the
and
became
known
as
king
of
scots
scotland
seemed
to
have
passed
entirely
under
france
we
know
that
there
was
some
ground
for
the
protestant
alarm
because
the
girl
queen
had
been
induced
to
sign
documents
which
transferred
her
rights
in
case
of
her
decease
without
issue
to
the
king
of
france
and
his
heirs
these
documents
were
in
direct
antagonism
to
the
assurance
given
to
the
scottish
parliament
of
the
maintenance
of
national
independence
the
french
alliance
seemed
to
have
gained
a
complete
triumph
while
the
shout
of
joy
raised
by
its
supporters
was
really
the
of
the
cause
knox
and
the
congregation
had
rendered
it
for
ever
impossible
nor
was
it
long
before
this
became
apparent
in
november
mary
tudor
died
and
england
was
again
protestant
henry
ii
ordered
francis
and
mary
to
assume
the
arms
of
england
in
virtue
of
mary
descent
from
margaret
tudor
which
made
her
in
roman
catholic
eyes
the
rightful
queen
of
england
elizabeth
being
born
out
of
wedlock
the
protestant
queen
of
england
had
thus
an
additional
motive
for
opposition
to
the
government
of
mary
of
guise
and
her
daughter
it
was
unfortunate
for
the
that
at
this
particular
juncture
she
was
entering
into
strained
relations
with
the
reformers
hitherto
she
had
succeeded
in
satisfying
knox
himself
but
in
the
beginning
of
she
adopted
more
severe
measures
and
the
lords
of
the
congregation
began
to
discuss
a
treasonable
alliance
with
england
which
proved
the
beginning
of
the
end
the
treaty
of
set
the
french
government
free
to
pay
greater
attention
to
the
progress
of
scottish
affairs
and
mary
of
guise
forthwith
denounced
the
leading
protestant
preachers
as
heretics
it
was
much
too
late
the
immediate
result
was
the
perth
riots
of
may
and
june
which
involved
the
destruction
of
the
religious
houses
which
were
the
glory
of
the
fair
city
the
aspect
of
affairs
was
so
threatening
that
the
regent
came
to
terms
and
promised
that
she
would
take
no
vengeance
on
the
people
of
perth
and
that
she
would
not
leave
a
french
garrison
in
the
town
the
regent
kept
her
word
in
garrisoning
the
town
with
scotsmen
but
her
introduction
of
a
french
bodyguard
in
attendance
on
her
own
person
was
regarded
as
a
breach
of
her
promise
the
destruction
of
religious
buildings
continued
although
knox
did
his
endeavour
to
save
the
palace
of
scone
the
protestants
held
andrews
while
the
regent
entered
into
negotiations
which
they
considered
to
be
a
mere
subterfuge
for
gaining
time
and
on
the
june
they
marched
upon
edinburgh
in
july
occurred
the
sudden
death
of
henry
ii
francis
and
mary
succeeded
and
the
supreme
power
in
france
and
in
scotland
passed
to
the
house
of
guise
the
protestants
who
had
been
making
overtures
to
cecil
and
elizabeth
declared
in
october
that
the
regent
had
been
deposed
this
bold
step
was
justified
by
the
help
received
from
england
and
by
the
indignation
caused
by
the
excesses
of
the
regent
french
troops
in
scotland
so
far
had
religious
emotion
outrun
the
sentiment
of
nationality
that
the
protestants
were
willing
to
admit
almost
any
english
claim
the
result
of
elizabeth
treaty
with
the
rebels
was
that
they
were
enabled
to
besiege
leith
by
means
of
an
english
fleet
while
the
regent
took
refuge
in
edinburgh
castle
the
english
attack
on
leith
was
unsuccessful
but
the
dangerous
illness
of
the
led
to
the
conclusion
of
peace
a
truce
was
made
on
condition
that
all
foreign
soldiers
french
and
english
alike
should
leave
scotland
and
that
the
scottish
claim
to
the
english
throne
should
be
abandoned
on
the
june
mary
died
the
wisdom
of
the
policy
of
her
later
years
may
be
questioned
but
her
conduct
during
her
widowhood
forms
a
strange
contrast
to
that
of
her
tudor
in
similar
circumstances
it
is
probable
that
her
intentions
were
honest
enough
and
that
the
protestant
indignation
at
her
falsehoods
was
based
on
invincible
misunderstanding
her
gracious
charm
of
manner
was
the
concomitant
of
a
tolerance
rare
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
she
died
at
peace
with
all
men
and
surrounded
by
those
who
had
been
in
arms
against
her
receiving
all
her
nobles
with
all
pleasure
with
a
pleasant
countenance
and
even
embracing
them
with
a
kiss
of
love
her
death
set
the
lords
of
the
congregation
free
to
carry
out
their
ecclesiastical
programme
in
august
roman
catholicism
was
abolished
by
the
scottish
parliament
and
the
celebration
of
the
mass
forbidden
under
severe
penalties
there
remained
the
question
of
the
ratification
of
the
treaty
of
edinburgh
the
final
form
of
the
agreement
by
which
peace
had
been
made
the
young
queen
of
scots
objected
to
the
treaty
on
the
ground
that
it
included
a
clause
that
the
most
christian
king
and
queen
mary
and
each
of
them
abstain
henceforth
from
using
the
title
and
bearing
the
arms
of
the
kingdom
of
england
or
of
ireland
she
interpreted
the
word
henceforth
as
involving
an
absolute
renunciation
of
her
claim
to
the
english
throne
and
so
prejudicing
her
succession
should
she
survive
elizabeth
cecil
had
suggested
to
the
scots
that
it
might
be
advisable
to
raise
the
claim
of
the
lord
james
stewart
an
illegitimate
son
of
james
v
and
afterwards
earl
of
moray
to
the
throne
or
to
support
that
of
the
house
of
hamilton
the
scots
improved
on
this
suggestion
and
proposed
that
elizabeth
should
marry
the
earl
of
arran
the
eldest
son
of
the
duke
of
chatelherault
who
might
succeed
to
the
throne
there
were
many
reasons
why
elizabeth
should
not
wed
the
imbecile
arran
and
it
may
safely
be
said
that
she
never
seriously
considered
the
project
although
she
continued
to
trifle
with
the
suggestion
which
formed
a
useful
form
of
intrigue
against
mary
the
situation
was
considerably
altered
by
the
death
of
francis
ii
in
december
that
event
was
on
the
whole
welcome
to
elizabeth
for
it
destroyed
the
power
of
the
guises
and
mary
stuart
had
now
to
face
her
scottish
difficulties
without
french
aid
she
was
not
on
good
terms
with
her
catherine
de
medici
who
now
controlled
the
destinies
of
france
and
it
was
evident
that
she
must
accept
the
fact
of
the
scottish
reformation
and
enter
upon
a
conflict
with
the
theocratic
tendencies
of
the
church
and
with
the
scottish
nobles
who
were
the
pensioners
of
elizabeth
on
the
other
hand
although
francis
ii
was
dead
his
widow
survived
young
beautiful
charming
and
a
queen
the
dissolution
of
her
first
marriage
had
removed
an
actual
difficulty
from
the
path
of
the
english
queen
but
after
all
it
only
meant
that
she
might
be
able
to
contract
an
alliance
still
more
dangerous
as
early
as
december
throckmorton
warned
elizabeth
that
she
must
have
an
eye
to
the
second
marriage
of
mary
stuart
the
queen
of
england
had
a
choice
of
alternatives
she
might
prosecute
the
intrigue
with
the
earl
of
arran
capture
mary
on
her
way
to
scotland
and
boldly
adopt
the
position
of
the
leader
of
protestantism
there
were
however
many
difficulties
ecclesiastical
foreign
and
personal
in
such
a
course
arran
was
an
impossible
husband
knox
and
the
lords
of
the
congregation
made
good
allies
but
bad
subjects
and
the
inevitable
struggle
with
spain
would
be
precipitated
the
other
course
was
to
attempt
to
win
mary
confidence
and
to
prevent
her
from
contracting
an
alliance
with
the
hapsburgs
which
was
probably
what
elizabeth
most
feared
this
was
the
alternative
finally
adopted
by
the
queen
of
england
but
very
characteristically
she
did
not
immediately
abandon
the
other
possibility
on
the
pretext
that
mary
refused
to
confirm
the
treaty
of
edinburgh
her
cousin
declined
to
grant
her
request
for
a
from
france
to
scotland
and
spoke
of
the
scottish
queen
in
terms
which
mary
took
the
first
opportunity
of
resenting
the
queen
your
mistress
she
remarked
to
the
english
ambassador
who
brought
the
refusal
doth
say
that
i
am
young
and
do
lack
experience
indeed
i
confess
i
am
younger
than
she
is
and
do
want
experience
but
i
have
age
enough
and
experience
to
use
myself
towards
my
friends
and
kinsfolk
friendly
and
uprightly
and
i
trust
my
discretion
shall
not
so
fail
me
that
my
passion
shall
move
me
to
use
other
language
of
her
than
it
becometh
of
a
queen
and
my
next
kinswoman
when
in
august
mary
did
sail
from
france
to
scotland
elizabeth
made
an
effort
to
capture
her
it
was
characteristically
hesitating
and
it
succeeded
only
in
giving
mary
an
impression
of
elizabeth
hostility
some
months
later
elizabeth
imprisoned
the
countess
of
lennox
the
mother
of
darnley
for
giving
god
thanks
because
when
the
ships
were
almost
near
taking
of
the
scottish
queen
there
fell
down
a
mist
from
heaven
that
separated
them
and
preserved
her
the
arrival
of
mary
in
scotland
effectually
put
an
end
to
the
arran
intrigue
but
the
of
scarcely
nineteen
years
had
many
difficulties
with
which
to
contend
as
a
devout
roman
catholic
she
had
to
face
the
relentless
opposition
of
knox
and
the
congregation
who
objected
even
to
her
private
exercise
of
her
own
faith
as
the
representative
of
the
french
alliance
now
but
a
dead
cause
she
was
confronted
by
an
english
party
which
included
not
only
her
avowed
enemies
but
many
of
her
real
or
pretended
friends
her
brother
the
lord
james
stewart
whom
she
made
earl
of
moray
and
who
guided
the
early
policy
of
her
reign
was
constantly
in
elizabeth
pay
as
were
most
of
her
other
advisers
her
secretary
maitland
of
lethington
the
most
distinguished
and
the
ablest
scottish
statesman
of
his
day
had
as
the
fixed
aim
of
his
policy
a
good
understanding
with
england
furthermore
she
was
disliked
by
all
the
nobles
who
had
seized
upon
the
property
of
the
church
and
added
it
to
their
own
possessions
up
to
the
age
of
she
had
by
scots
law
the
right
of
recalling
all
grants
of
land
made
during
her
minority
and
her
greedy
nobles
knew
well
that
the
victory
of
roman
catholicism
meant
the
restoration
of
church
lands
her
relations
with
france
were
uncertain
and
the
guises
found
their
attention
fully
occupied
at
home
as
the
next
heir
to
the
throne
of
england
she
was
bound
to
be
very
careful
in
her
dealings
with
elizabeth
united
by
every
tie
of
blood
and
sentiment
to
rome
and
the
guises
she
was
forced
for
reasons
of
policy
to
remain
on
good
terms
with
protestantism
and
the
tudor
queen
of
england
the
first
years
of
mary
reign
in
scotland
were
marked
by
the
continuance
of
good
relations
between
herself
and
her
whom
she
entrusted
with
the
government
of
the
kingdom
in
she
suppressed
the
most
powerful
catholic
noble
in
scotland
the
earl
of
huntly
the
result
of
this
policy
was
to
raise
an
unfounded
suspicion
in
england
and
spain
that
the
queen
of
scots
was
no
more
devout
towards
rome
than
for
the
sustentation
of
her
uncles
the
indignation
felt
at
conduct
among
roman
catholics
in
england
and
in
spain
may
have
been
one
of
the
reasons
for
elizabeth
adopting
a
more
distinctly
protestant
position
in
in
the
act
of
supremacy
of
that
year
the
first
avowed
reference
is
made
to
the
authority
used
by
henry
viii
and
edward
vi
the
supreme
headship
of
the
church
it
at
all
events
made
elizabeth
position
less
difficult
because
spain
and
austria
were
not
likely
to
attack
england
in
the
interests
of
a
queen
whose
orthodoxy
was
doubtful
meanwhile
elizabeth
was
directing
all
her
efforts
to
prevent
mary
from
contracting
a
second
marriage
and
at
all
hazards
to
secure
that
she
should
not
marry
don
carlos
of
spain
or
the
archduke
of
austria
her
persistent
endeavours
to
bribe
scottish
nobles
were
directed
with
considerable
acuteness
to
creating
an
english
party
strong
enough
to
deter
foreign
princes
from
seeking
upon
a
country
so
much
at
her
devotion
she
warned
mary
that
any
alliance
with
a
mighty
prince
would
offend
england
and
so
imperil
her
succession
mary
on
her
part
was
attempting
to
obtain
a
recognition
of
her
position
as
second
person
heir
presumptive
and
she
professed
her
willingness
to
take
elizabeth
advice
in
the
matter
of
her
marriage
the
english
queen
made
various
suggestions
and
found
objections
to
them
all
finally
she
proposed
that
mary
should
marry
her
own
favourite
leicester
and
a
long
correspondence
followed
it
was
suggested
that
the
two
queens
should
have
an
interview
but
this
project
fell
through
elizabeth
of
course
was
too
fondly
attached
to
leicester
to
see
him
become
the
husband
of
her
beautiful
rival
mary
on
her
part
despised
the
earl
and
leicester
himself
apologized
to
ambassador
for
the
presumption
of
the
proposal
alleging
the
invention
of
that
proposition
to
have
proceeded
from
master
cecil
his
secret
enemy
while
the
leicester
negotiations
were
in
progress
the
earl
of
lennox
who
had
been
exiled
in
returned
to
scotland
with
his
son
henry
lord
darnley
a
handsome
youth
eighteen
years
of
age
as
early
as
may
knox
suspected
that
mary
intended
to
marry
darnley
there
is
little
doubt
that
it
was
a
but
there
were
also
political
reasons
for
darnley
was
after
mary
herself
the
nearest
heir
to
elizabeth
throne
and
only
the
hamiltons
stood
between
him
and
the
crown
of
scotland
he
had
been
born
and
educated
in
england
as
also
had
been
his
mother
the
daughter
of
angus
and
margaret
tudor
and
elizabeth
might
have
used
him
as
against
mary
claim
that
claim
the
english
queen
refused
to
acknowledge
although
in
the
end
of
murray
and
maitland
of
lethington
tried
their
utmost
to
persuade
her
to
do
so
on
the
july
mary
was
married
to
darnley
in
the
chapel
of
holyrood
elizabeth
chose
to
take
offence
and
murray
raised
a
rebellion
there
are
two
stories
of
plots
there
are
hints
of
a
scheme
to
capture
mary
and
darnley
and
murray
on
the
other
hand
alleged
that
darnley
had
entered
into
a
conspiracy
to
kidnap
him
it
is
at
all
events
certain
that
murray
raised
a
revolt
and
that
the
people
rallied
to
mary
who
drove
her
brother
across
the
border
elizabeth
received
murray
with
coldness
and
asked
him
how
he
being
a
rebel
to
her
sister
of
scotland
durst
take
the
boldness
upon
him
to
come
within
her
realm
but
murray
confident
in
elizabeth
promise
of
aid
knew
what
this
hypocritical
outburst
was
worth
and
the
english
queen
soon
afterwards
wrote
to
mary
in
his
favour
the
motive
which
murray
alleged
for
his
revolt
was
his
fear
for
the
true
religion
in
view
of
marriage
to
darnley
nominally
a
roman
catholic
but
his
position
with
regard
to
the
rizzio
bond
renders
it
as
we
shall
see
somewhat
difficult
to
give
him
credit
for
sincerity
it
is
more
likely
that
he
was
ambitious
of
ruling
the
kingdom
with
mary
as
a
prisoner
about
elizabeth
complicity
there
can
be
no
doubt
mary
troubles
had
only
begun
on
the
january
randolph
the
english
ambassador
wrote
from
edinburgh
i
can
not
tell
what
mislikings
of
late
there
hath
been
between
her
grace
and
her
husband
he
presses
earnestly
for
the
matrimonial
crown
which
she
is
loth
hastily
to
grant
darnley
in
fact
had
proved
a
vicious
fool
and
was
possessed
of
a
fool
ambition
rizzio
mary
italian
secretary
who
had
urged
the
darnley
marriage
strongly
warned
mary
against
giving
her
husband
any
real
share
in
the
government
and
darnley
determined
that
rizzio
should
be
removed
he
therefore
entered
into
a
conspiracy
with
his
natural
enemies
the
scottish
nobles
who
professed
to
be
willing
to
secure
the
throne
for
this
youth
whom
they
despised
and
hated
the
plot
involved
the
murder
of
rizzio
the
imprisonment
of
mary
the
for
darnley
and
the
return
of
murray
and
his
accomplices
who
were
still
in
exile
the
english
government
was
of
course
privy
to
the
scheme
the
murder
was
carried
out
in
circumstances
of
great
brutality
on
the
night
of
the
march
condition
of
health
having
then
passed
almost
to
the
end
of
seven
months
in
our
birth
renders
the
carrying
out
of
the
deed
in
her
presence
and
while
rizzio
was
her
guest
almost
certainly
an
attempt
upon
the
queen
own
life
there
were
numberless
opportunities
of
slaying
rizzio
elsewhere
and
the
ghastly
details
the
sudden
appearance
of
ruthven
hollow
pale
just
risen
from
a
sick
bed
the
pistol
of
ker
of
faudonside
are
so
rich
in
dramatic
effect
that
one
can
scarcely
doubt
what
was
intended
the
plot
failed
in
its
main
purpose
rizzio
indeed
was
killed
and
murray
made
his
appearance
next
morning
and
obtained
forgiveness
the
queen
embracit
him
and
kisset
him
alleging
that
in
caice
he
had
bene
at
hame
he
wald
not
have
sufferit
her
to
have
bene
sa
uncourterly
handlit
but
the
success
ended
here
mary
won
over
her
husband
and
together
they
escaped
and
fled
to
dunbar
darnley
deserted
his
accomplices
proclaimed
his
innocence
and
strongly
urged
the
punishment
of
the
murderers
they
of
course
threw
themselves
on
the
hospitality
of
queen
elizabeth
who
sent
them
money
and
lied
to
mary
who
did
not
put
too
much
faith
in
her
assurances
on
june
a
prince
was
born
in
edinburgh
castle
but
the
event
brought
about
only
a
partial
reconciliation
between
his
unhappy
parents
mary
was
shamefully
treated
by
her
worthless
husband
and
in
the
following
november
her
nobles
suggested
to
her
the
project
of
a
divorce
darnley
however
was
not
doomed
to
the
fate
which
overtook
his
descendants
the
life
of
a
king
without
a
crown
he
had
awakened
the
enmity
of
men
whose
feuds
were
and
the
rizzio
conspirators
were
not
likely
to
forgive
the
upstart
youth
whose
inconstancy
had
foiled
their
plan
for
mary
fall
and
whose
treachery
had
involved
them
in
exile
darnley
had
proved
useless
even
as
a
tool
for
the
nobles
he
had
offended
mary
and
disgusted
everybody
in
scotland
and
there
were
many
who
were
willing
to
do
without
him
at
this
point
a
new
tool
was
ready
to
the
hands
of
the
discontented
barons
the
earl
of
bothwell
whether
with
mary
consent
or
not
aspired
to
the
queen
hand
and
devised
a
plan
for
the
murder
of
darnley
on
the
night
of
the
february
the
wretched
boy
not
yet
years
of
age
was
strangled
and
the
house
in
which
he
had
been
living
was
blown
up
with
gunpowder
public
opinion
accused
bothwell
of
the
murder
he
was
tried
and
found
innocent
and
parliament
put
its
seal
upon
his
acquittal
on
the
april
he
seized
the
person
of
the
queen
as
she
was
travelling
from
linlithgow
to
edinburgh
and
mary
married
him
on
the
may
malum
maio
nubere
vulgus
the
nobles
almost
immediately
raised
a
rebellion
professedly
to
deliver
the
queen
from
the
thraldom
of
bothwell
on
june
she
surrendered
at
carberry
hill
and
the
nobles
disregarded
a
pledge
of
loyalty
to
the
queen
given
on
condition
of
her
abandoning
bothwell
alleging
that
she
was
still
in
correspondence
with
him
they
now
accused
her
of
murdering
her
husband
and
imprisoned
her
in
lochleven
castle
the
whole
affair
is
wrapped
in
mystery
but
it
is
impossible
to
give
the
earl
of
morton
and
the
other
nobles
any
credit
for
honesty
of
purpose
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
they
used
bothwell
for
their
own
ends
and
while
they
represented
the
murder
as
the
result
of
a
domestic
conspiracy
between
the
queen
and
bothwell
they
afterwards
when
quarrelling
among
themselves
hurled
at
each
other
accusations
of
participation
in
the
plot
and
their
leader
the
earl
of
morton
died
on
the
scaffold
as
a
criminal
put
to
death
for
the
murder
of
darnley
this
of
course
does
not
exclude
the
hypothesis
of
mary
guilt
and
while
the
view
of
hume
or
of
froude
could
not
now
be
seriously
advanced
in
its
entirety
it
is
only
right
to
say
that
a
majority
of
historians
are
of
opinion
that
she
at
least
connived
at
the
murder
the
question
of
her
implication
as
a
principal
in
the
plot
depends
upon
the
authenticity
of
the
documents
known
as
the
casket
letters
which
purported
to
be
written
by
the
queen
to
bothwell
and
which
the
insurgent
lords
afterwards
produced
as
evidence
against
her
moray
had
left
scotland
in
the
end
of
april
when
he
returned
in
the
beginning
of
august
he
found
that
the
prisoner
of
lochleven
to
whom
he
owed
his
advancement
and
his
earldom
had
been
forced
to
sign
a
deed
of
abdication
nominating
himself
as
regent
for
her
infant
son
on
the
august
he
went
to
lochleven
and
saw
his
sister
as
he
had
done
after
the
murder
of
rizzio
when
she
was
a
prisoner
in
holyrood
till
an
hour
past
midnight
elizabeth
pensioner
preached
to
the
unfortunate
princess
on
righteousness
and
judgment
leaving
her
that
night
in
hope
of
nothing
but
of
god
mercy
it
was
merely
a
threat
mary
life
was
safe
for
elizabeth
roused
for
once
to
a
feeling
of
generosity
had
forbidden
moray
to
make
any
attempt
on
that
next
morning
he
graciously
accepted
the
regency
and
left
his
sister
prison
with
her
kisses
on
his
lips
on
the
may
mary
escaped
from
lochleven
and
her
brother
at
once
prepared
a
hostile
force
to
meet
her
her
army
composed
largely
of
protestants
marched
towards
dunbarton
castle
where
they
desired
to
place
the
queen
for
safe
keeping
the
regent
intercepted
her
at
langside
and
inflicted
a
complete
defeat
upon
her
forces
mary
was
again
a
fugitive
and
her
followers
strongly
urged
her
to
take
refuge
in
france
but
elizabeth
had
given
her
a
promise
of
protection
and
mary
impelled
by
some
fateful
impulse
resolved
to
throw
herself
on
the
mercy
of
her
kinswoman
on
the
day
of
may
her
little
boat
crossed
the
solway
when
the
queen
of
scots
the
daughter
of
the
house
of
guise
the
widow
of
a
monarch
of
the
line
of
valois
set
foot
on
english
soil
as
a
suppliant
for
the
protection
which
came
to
her
only
by
death
the
last
faint
hope
must
have
faded
out
of
the
hearts
of
the
few
who
still
longed
for
an
independent
scotland

by
gratitude
and
by
ancient
tradition
to
the
ally
who
more
than
once
had
proved
its
salvation

ix
the
union
of
the
crowns
when
mary
fled
to
england
elizabeth
refused
to
see
her
on
the
ground
that
she
ought
first
to
clear
herself
from
the
suspicion
of
guilt
in
connection
with
the
murder
of
darnley
in
the
end
mary
agreed
that
the
case
should
be
submitted
to
the
judgment
of
a
commission
appointed
by
elizabeth
and
she
appeared
as
prosecuting
moray
and
his
friends
as
rebels
and
traitors
they
defended
themselves
by
bringing
accusations
against
mary
and
produced
the
casket
letters
and
other
documents
in
support
of
their
assertions
mary
asked
to

thought

refused

he
was
informed
that

feelings
had
been
hurt
by
mary
accusing

of

mary

then
withdrew
and
elizabeth
closed
the
case
with
the
oracular
decision
that
nothing
has
been
adduced
against
the
earl
of
moray
and
his
adherents
as
yet
that
may
impair
their
honour
or
allegiances
and
on
the
other
part
there
has
been
nothing
sufficiently
produced

shown
by

the
queen
of
england
should
conceive
or
take
any
evil
opinion
of
the
queen
her
good
sister
for
anything
yet
seen
so
elizabeth
good
sister
was
subjected
to
a
rigorous
imprisonment
and
the
earl
of
moray
returned
to
scotland
with
an
increased
allowance
of
english
gold
henceforth
the
successive
regents
of
scotland
had
to
guide
their
policy
in

with
elizabeth
wishes
if
they
rebelled
she
could
always
threaten
to
release
her
prisoner
and
once
or
twice
in
the
course

long
weary
years
mary
whose
nature
was
buoyant
actually
dared
to
hope
that

would

moved

was

suppressed
in

was
assassinated
at

and
the
earl
of
lennox
the
father
of

and

succeeded
to
the
regency
while
mary
scottish
supporters
who
had
continued
to
fight
for
her
desperate
cause
were
strengthened
by
the
accession
of
maitland
of
lethington

with
kirkaldy

also
a
recruit
from

party
held
edinburgh

were

had

suggested
in
letters
from

papal
agent
rudolfi

in

norfolk
was
put

death
lennox
had
been
killed
in
september
and
his
successor
the
earl
of
mar
was
approached
on
the
subject
of
taking
mary
life
elizabeth
was
unwilling
to
accept
the
responsibility
for
the
deed
and
proposed
to
deliver
up
mary
to
mar
on
the
understanding
that
she
should
be
immediately
killed
mar
who
was
an
honourable
man
declined
to
listen
to
the
proposal
but
after
his
death
which
occurred
in
october
the
new
regent
the
earl
of
morton
professed
his
willingness
to
undertake
the
accomplishment
of
the
deed
if
elizabeth
would
openly
acknowledge
it
this
she
refused
to
do
and
the
plot
failed
it
is
characteristic
that
the
last
douglas
to
play
an
important
part
in
scottish
history
should
be
the
leading
actor
in
such
a
plot
as
this
the
castle
of
edinburgh
fell
in
june
and
with
its
surrender
passed
away
mary
last
chance
in
scotland
morton
held
the
regency
till
when
he
was
forced
to
resign
and
the
young
king
now
twelve
years
old
became
the
nominal
ruler
in
morton
was
condemned
to
death
as
airt
and
pairt
in
darnley
murder
and
elizabeth
failed
in
her
efforts
to
save
him
mary
entered
into
negotiations
with
elizabeth
for
her
release
and
return
to
scotland
as
with
james
vi
and
the
english
queen
played
with
her
prisoner
while
all
the
time
she
was
discussing
projects
for
her
death
the
key
to
the
policy
of
james
is
his
desire
to
secure
the
succession
to
the
english
crown
to
that
end
he
was
willing
to
sacrifice
all
other
considerations
nor
had
he
on
other
grounds
any
desire
to
share
his
throne
with
his
mother
in
he
negotiated
a
league
with
england
which
however
contained
a
provision
that
the
said
league
be
without
prejudice
in
any
sort
to
any
former
league
or
alliance
betwixt
this
realm
and
any
other
auld
friends
and
confederates
thereof
except
only
in
matters
of
religion
wheranent
we
do
fully
consent
the
league
be
defensive
and
offensive
as
we
are
at
the
era
of
religious
wars
the
latter
section
of
the
clause
goes
far
to
neutralize
the
former
scotland
was
at
last
at
the
disposal
of
the
sovereign
of
england
even
the
tragedy
of
fotheringay
scarcely
produced
a
passing
coldness
on
the
february
elizabeth
warrant
was
carried
out
and
mary
head
fell
on
the
block
she
was
accused
of
plotting
for
her
own
escape
and
against
elizabeth
life
it
is
probable
that
she
had
so
plotted
and
it
would
be
childish
to
express
surprise
or
indignation
the
english
queen
on
her
part
had
injured
her
kinswoman
too
deeply
to
render
it
possible
to
be
generous
now
mary
had
sent
her
on
her
arrival
in
england
a
diamond
jewel
which
as
she
afterwards
reminded
her
i
received
as
a
token
from
you
and
with
assurance
to
be
succoured
against
my
rebels
and
even
that
on
my
retiring
towards
you
you
would
come
to
the
very
frontiers
in
order
to
assist
me
which
had
been
confirmed
to
me
by
divers
messengers
had
the
protection
thus
promised
been
vouchsafed
it
might
have
spared
elizabeth
many
years
of
trouble
but
it
was
now
too
late
and
the
relentless
logic
of
events
forced
her
to
complete
the
tale
of
her
treachery
and
injustice
by
a
deed
which
she
herself
could
not
but
regard
as
a
crime
but
while
this
excuse
may
be
made
for
the
deed
itself
there
can
be
no
apology
for
the
manner
of
it
the
queen
of
england
stooped
to
urge
her
servants
to
murder
her
kinswoman
when
they
refused
she
was
mean
enough
to
contrive
so
as
to
throw
the
responsibility
upon
her
secretary
davison
after
death
she
wrote
to
king
james
and
expressed
her
sincere
regret
at
having
cut
off
the
head
of
his
mother
by
accident
james
accepted
the
apology
and
in
the
following
year
made
preparations
against
the
armada
had
the
son
of
mary
stuart
been
otherwise
constituted
it
would
scarcely
have
been
safe
for
elizabeth
to
persevere
in
the
execution
of
his
mother
an
alliance
between
scotland
and
spain
might
have
proved
dangerous
for
england
but
elizabeth
knew
well
the
type
of
man
with
whom
she
had
to
deal
and
events
proved
that
she
was
wise
in
her
generation
and
james
on
his
part
had
his
reward
elizabeth
died
in
march
and
her
successor
was
the
king
of
scots
who
entered
upon
a
heritage
which
had
been
bought
in
the
view
of
his
catholic
subjects
by
the
blood
of
his
mother
and
which
was
to
claim
as
its
next
victim
his
second
son
within
years
of
his
accession
his
house
had
lost
not
only
their
new
kingdom
but
their
ancestral
throne
as
well
in
all
james
references
to
the
union
it
is
clear
that
he
regarded
that
event
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
monarch
had
it
proved
of
as
little
value
to
his
subjects
as
to
the
stuart
line
there
would
have
been
small
reason
for
remembering
it
the
union
of
england
and
scotland
was
one
of
the
events
most
clearly
by
a
benignant
fate
but
it
is
difficult
to
feel
much
sympathy
for
the
son
who
would
not
risk
its
postponement
when
by
the
possible
sacrifice
of
his
personal
ambition
he
might
have
saved
the
life
of
his
mother
there
are
certain
aspects
of
james
life
in
scotland
that
explain
his
future
policy
and
they
are
therefore
important
for
our
purpose
in
the
first
place
he
spent
his
days
in
one
long
struggle
with
the
theocratic
church
system
which
had
been
brought
to
scotland
by
knox
and
developed
by
his
great
successor
andrew
melville
the
church
courts
local
and
central
had
maintained
the
old
ecclesiastical
jurisdiction
and
they
dealt
out
justice
with
impartial
hand
in
all
questions
of
morality
religion
education
and
marriage
the
kirk
session
or
the
presbytery
or
the
general
assembly
was
the
church
was
by
far
the
most
important
factor
in
the
national
life
it
interfered
in
numberless
ways
with
legislative
and
executive
functions
on
one
occasion
king
james
consulted
the
presbytery
of
edinburgh
about
the
raising
of
a
force
to
suppress
a
rebellion
and
as
late
as
he
approached
the
general
assembly
with
reference
to
a
tax
and
promised
that
his
chamber
doors
sould
be
made
patent
to
the
meanest
minister
in
scotland
there
sould
not
be
anie
meane
gentleman
in
scotland
more
subject
to
the
good
order
and
discipline
of
the
kirk
than
he
would
be
andrew
melville
had
told
him
that
there
is
twa
kings
and
twa
kingdomes
in
scotland
thair

james

saxt

and
of

nocht
a

nor
a
lord
nor
a
heid
bot
a
member
james
had
done
his
utmost
to
assert
his
authority
over
the
church
he
had
tried
to
establish
episcopacy
in
scotland
to
replace
the
presbyterian
system
and
had
succeeded
only
to
a
very
limited
extent
presbytery
he
said
agreeth
as
well
with
a
king
as
god
with
the
devil
so
he
went
to
england
not
only
prepared
to
welcome
the
episcopal
form
of
and
to
graciously
receive
the
episcopal
adulation
so
freely
showered
upon
him
but
also
determined
to
suppress
at
all
hazards
the
proud
puritanes
who
claining
to
their
paritie
and
crying
are
all
but
vile
wormes
yet
will
judge
and
give
law
to
their
king
but
will
be
judged
nor
controlled
by
none
sillie
vassal
was
melville
of
the
royal
character
in
james
own
presence
god
hath
given
us
a
solomon
exulted
the
bishop
of
winchester
and
he
recorded
the
fact
in
print
that
all
the
world
might
know
james
was
wrong
in
mistaking
the
english
puritans
for
the
scottish
presbyterians
alike
in
number
in
influence
and
in
aim
his
new
subjects
differed
from
his
old
enemies
english
puritanism
had
already
proved
unsuited
to
the
genius
of
the
nation
and
it
had
given
up
all
hope
of
the
abolition
of
episcopacy
the
millenary
petition
asked
only
some
changes
in
the
ritual
of
the
church
and
certain
moderate
reforms
had
james
received
their
requests
in
a
more
reasonable
spirit
he
might
have
succeeded
in
reconciling
at
all
events
the
more
moderate
section
of
them
to
the
church
and
at
the
very
first
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
likely
to
win
for
himself
the
blessing
of
the
which
he
was
so
eager
to
obtain
but
just
at
this
crisis
he
found
the
first
symptoms
of
parliamentary
opposition
and
here
again
his
training
in
scotland
interfered
the
church
and
the
church
alone
had
opposed
him
in
scotland
he
had
never
discovered
that
a
parliament
could
be
other
than
subservient
it
was
therefore
natural
for
him
to
connect
the
parliamentary
discontent
with
puritan
dissatisfaction
scottish
puritans
had
employed
the
general
assembly
as
their
main
weapon
of
offence
their
english
fellows
evidently
desired
to
use
the
house
of
commons
as
an
engine
for
similar
purposes
therefore
said
king
james
i
shall
make
them
conform
themselves
or
i
will
harry
them
out
of
the
land
or
else
do
worse
so
he
did
worse
and
prepared
the
way
for
the
puritan
revolution
if
the
english
succession
enabled
the
king
to
suppress
the
scottish
assembly
the
assembly
had
its
revenge
for
the
fear
of
it
brought
a
snare
and
james
may
justly
be
considered
one
of
the
founders
of
english
dissent
a
violent
hatred
of
the
temporal
claims
of
the
church
also
affected
james
attitude
to
roman
catholicism
his
catholic
subjects
in
scotland
had
not
been
in
a
position
to
do
him
any
harm
and
the
son
of
mary
stuart
could
not
but
have
some
sympathy
for
his
accordingly
we
find
him
telling
his
first
parliament
i
acknowledge
the
roman
church
to
be
our
mother
church
although
defiled
with
some
infirmities
and
corruption
but
after
the
gunpowder
plot
and
when
he
was
engaged
in
a
controversy
with
cardinal
perron
about
the
right
of
the
pope
to
depose
kings
he
came
to
prove
that
the
pope
is
antichrist
and
our
mother
church
none
other
than
the
scarlet
woman
his
scottish
experience
revealed
clearly
enough
that
the
claims
of
rome
and
geneva
were
identical
in
their
essence
there
is
on
record
an
incident
that
will
serve
to
illustrate
his
position
in
the
scottish
privy
council
reported
to
him
the
case
of
a
jesuit
john
ogilvie
he
bade
them
examine
ogilvie
if
he
proved
to
be
but
a
priest
who
had
said
mass
he
was
to
go
into
banishment
but
if
he
was
a
practiser
of
sedition
let
him
die
the
unfortunate
priest
showed
in
his
reply
that
he
held
the
same
view
of
the
royal
supremacy
as
did
the
presbyterian
clergy
it
was
enough
they
hanged
him
once
more
james
irish
policy
seems
to
have
been
influenced
by
his
experience
of
the
scottish
highlands
he
had
conceived
the
plan
which
was
afterwards
carried
out
in
the
plantation
of
ulster
planting
colonies
among
them
of
answerable
inland
subjects
that
within
short
time
may
reforme
and
civilize
the
among
them
rooting
out
or
transporting
the
barbarous
or
stubborne
sort
and
planting
civilitie
in
their
roomes
although
james
continued
to
carry
on
his
efforts
in
this
direction
after
yet
it
may
be
said
that
the
english
succession
prevented
his
giving
effect
to
his
scheme
and
that
it
also
interfered
with
his
intentions
regarding
the
abolition
of
hereditary
jurisdictions
which
remained
to
wracke
the
whole
land
till
after
the
rising
of
on
the
april
king
james
set
out
from
edinburgh
to
enter
upon
the
inheritance
which
had
fallen
to
him
by
right
divine
his
departure
made
considerable
changes
in
the
condition
of
scotland
the
absence
of
any
fear
of
an
outbreak
of
hostilities
with
the
auld
enemy
was
a
great
boon
to
the
borders
but
there
was
little
love
lost
between
the
two
countries
the
union
of
the
crowns
did
not
of
course
affect
the
position
of
scotland
to
england
in
matters
of
trade
and
beyond
some
thirty
years
of
peace
james
ancient
kingdom
gained
but
little
king
james
who
possessed
considerable
powers
of
statesmanship
if
not
much
practical
wisdom
devised
the
impossible
project
of
a
union
of
the
kingdoms
in
what
god
hathe
conjoyned
he
said
let
no
man
separate
i
am
the
husband
and
all
the
whole
isle
is
my
lawful
wife
i
hope
therefore
that
no
man
will
be
so
unreasonable
as
to
think
that
i
that
am
a
christian
king
under
the
gospel
should
be
a
polygamist
and
husband
to
two
wives
he
desired
to
see
a
complete
union
one
king
one
law
one
church
scotland
would
he
trusted
with
time
become
but
as
cumberland
and
northumberland
and
those
other
remote
and
northern
shires
commissioners
were
appointed
and
in
they
produced
a
scheme
which
involved
commercial
equality
except
with
regard
to
cloth
and
meat
the
exception
being
made
by
mutual
consent
the
discussion
on
the
union
question
raised
the
subject
of
naturalization
and
the
rights
of
the
scots
born
after
james
accession
to
the
throne
the
royal
prerogative
became
involved
in
the
discussion
and
a
test
case
was
prepared
some
land
in
england
was
bought
for
the
infant
grandson
of
lord
colvill
or
colvin
of
culross
an
action
was
raised
against
two
defendants
who
refused
him
possession
of
the
land
and
they
defended
themselves
on
the
ground
that
the
child
as
an
alien
could
not
possess
land
in
england
it
was
decided
that
he
as
a
subject
of
the
king
of
scotland
was
also
a
subject
of
the
king
of
england
this
decision
and
the
repeal
of
the
laws
treating
scotland
as
a
hostile
country
proved
the
only
result
of
the
negotiations
for
union
the
english
parliament
would
not
listen
to
any
proposal
for
commercial
equality
and
the
king
had
to
abandon
his
cherished
project
james
had
boasted
to
his
english
parliament
that
if
they
agreed
to
commercial
equality
the
scottish
estates
would
in
three
days
adopt
english
law
it
is
doubtful
if
the
acquiescence
even
of
the
scottish
parliament
would
have
gone
so
far
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
english
succession
had
made
james
more
powerful
in
scotland
than
any
of
his
predecessors
had
been
here
i
sit
he
said
and
governe
scotland
with
my
pen
i
write
and
it
is
done
and
by
a
clearke
of
the
councell
i
governe
scotland
now
which
others
could
not
doe
by
the
sword
the
boast
was
justified
by
the
facts
the
king
instructions
to
his
privy
council
which
formed
the
scottish
executive
are
of
the
most
dictatorial
description
james
gives
his
orders
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
is
accustomed
to
unswerving
obedience
and
he
does
not
hesitate
to
reprove
his
erring
ministers
in
the
severest
terms
of
censure
the
whole
business
of
parliament
was
conducted
by
the
lords
of
the
articles
who
represented
the
spiritual
and
temporal
lords
and
the
commons
all
the
bishops
were
the
king
creatures
and
by
virtue
of
their
position
entirely
dependent
on
him
it
was
therefore
arranged
that
the
prelates
should
choose
representatives
of
the
temporal
lords
and
they
took
care
to
select
men
who
supported
the
king
policy
the
peers
were
allowed
to
choose
representatives
of
the
bishops
and
could
not
avoid
electing
the
king
friends
while
the
representatives
of
the
spiritual
and
temporal
lords
choose
men
to
appear
for
the
small
barons
and
the
burgesses
in
this
way
the
efficient
power
of
parliament
was
completely
monopolized
and
none
dared
to
dispute
the
king
will
even
the
church
was
reduced
to
an
unwilling
submission
which
from
its
very
nature
could
only
be
temporary
he
forbade
the
meeting
of
a
general
assembly
and
the
convening
of
an
assembly
at
aberdeen
in
defiance
of
his
command
in
served
to
give
him
an
opportunity
of
imprisoning
or
banishing
the
presbyterian
leaders
he
had
to
give
up
his
scheme
of
abolishing
the
presbyterian
church
courts
and
contented
himself
with
engrafting
on
to
the
existing
system
the
institution
of
episcopacy
which
had
practically
been
in
abeyance
since
although
scotland
was
never
without
its
titular
prelates
bishops
were
appointed
in
presbyteries
and
synods
were
ordered
to
elect
perpetual
moderators
and
the
scheme
was
devised
so
that
the
moderator
of
almost
every
synod
should
be
a
bishop
the
members
of
the
linlithgow
convention
which
accepted
this
scheme
were
specially
summoned
by
the
king
and
it
was
in
no
sense
a
free
assembly
of
the
church
but
the
royal
power
was
for
the
present
irresistible
in
an
assembly
which
met
at
glasgow
established
episcopacy
and
its
action
was
in
ratified
by
the
scots
parliament
three
of
the
scottish
bishops
received
english
orders
to
ensure
the
succession
but
to
prevent
any
claim
of
superiority
neither
english
primate
took
any
part
in
the
ceremony
in
the
assembly
met
at
aberdeen
and
the
king
made
five
proposals
which
are
known
as
the
five
articles
of
perth
from
their
adoption
there
in
the
five
articles
included
the
eucharist
to
be
received
kneeling
the
administration
of
the
sacrament
of
the
lord
supper
to
sick
persons
in
private
houses
the
administration
of
baptism
in
private
houses
in
cases
of
necessity
the
recognition
of
christmas
good
friday
easter
and
pentecost
and
the
episcopal
benediction
scottish
opposition
centred
round
the
first
article
which
was
not
welcomed
even
by
the
episcopalian
party
and
it
required
the
personal
interference
to
enforce
it
in
holyrood
chapel
during
his
stay
in
edinburgh
in
his
proposal
to
erect
in
the
chapel
representations
of
patriarchs
and
saints
shocked
even
the
bishops
on
whose
remonstrances
he
withdrew
his
orders
incidentally
administering
a
severe
rebuke
to
the
recalcitrant
prelates
at
whose
ignorance
he
could
not
but
wonder
not
till
the
following
year
were
the
articles
accepted
at
perth
under
fear
of
the
royal
displeasure
and
considerable
difficulty
was
experienced
in
enforcing
them
the
only
other
scottish
measures
of
james
reign
that
demand
mention
are
his
attempts
to
carry
out
his
policy
of
plantations
in
the
highlands
as
a
whole
the
scheme
failed
and
was
productive
of
considerable
misery
but
here
and
there
it
succeeded
and
it
tended
to
increase
the
power
of
the
government
the
end
of
the
reign
is
also
remarkable
for
attempts
at
scottish
colonization
resulting
in
the
foundation
of
nova

to
secure
for
the
church
some
of
its
ancient
revenues
more
serious
still
was
his
endeavour
to
bring
the
scottish
church
into
uniformity
with
the
usage
of
the
church
of
england
james
had
understood
that
any
further
attempt
to
alter
the
service
or
constitution
of
the
church
of
scotland
would
infallibly
lead
to
serious
trouble
he
had
given
up
an
intention
of
introducing
a
new
to
supersede
the
book
of
common
order
known
as
knox
liturgy
which
was
employed
in
the
church
though
not
to
the
exclusion
of
extemporary
prayers
when
charles
came
to
edinburgh
to
be
crowned
in
he
made
a
further
attempt
in
this
direction
and
although
he
had
to
postpone
the
introduction
of
this
particular
change
he
left
a
most
uneasy
feeling
not
only
among
the
presbyterians
but
also
among
the
bishops
themselves
an
altar
was
erected
in
holyrood
chapel
and
behind
it
was
a
crucifix
before
which
the
clergy
made
genuflexions
he
erected
edinburgh
into
a
bishopric
with
the
collegiate
church
of
giles
for
a
cathedral
and
the
bishops
of
edinburgh
as
they
followed
in
rapid
succession
gained
the
reputation
of
innovators
and
supporters
of
laud
and
the
english
even
more
dangerous
in
its
effect
was
a
general
order
for
the
clergy
to
wear
surplices
it
was
widely
disobeyed
but
it
created
very
great
alarm
in
canons
were
issued
for
the
church
of
scotland
which
owed
their
existence
to
the
dangerous
meddling
of
laud
now
archbishop
of
canterbury
james
who
loved
episcopacy
had
dreaded
the
influence
of
laud
in
scotland
his
fear
was
justified
for
it
was
given
to
laud
to
make
an
episcopal
church
impossible
north
of
the
tweed
although
certain
of
the
scottish
bishops
had
expressed
approval
of
these
canons
they
were
enjoined
in
the
church
by
royal
authority
and
the
scots
whose
theory
of
the
rights
of
the
church
was
much
more
high
than
that
of
laud
would
on
this
account
alone
have
met
them
with
resistance
but
the
canons
used
words
and
phrases
which
were
intolerable
to
scottish
ears
they
spoke
of
a
chancel
and
they
commended
auricular
confession
they
gave
the
scottish
bishops
something
like
the
authority
of
their
english
brethren
to
the
detriment
of
minister
and
and
they
made
the
use
of
a
new
compulsory
and
forbade
any
objection
to
it
two
years
elapsed
before
the
book
was
actually
introduced
it
was
english
and
it
had
been
forced
upon
the
church
by
the
state
and
worse
than
this
it
was
associated
with
the
hated
name
of
laud
and
with
his
suspected
designs
upon
the
protestant
religion
when
it
came
it
was
found
to
follow
the
english
almost
exactly
but
such
changes
as
there
were
seemed
suspicious
in
the
extreme
in
the
communion
service
the
rubric
preceding
the
prayer
of
consecration
read
thus
during
the
time
of
consecration
he
shall
stand
at
such
a
part
of
the
holy
table
where
he
may
with
the
more
ease
and
decency
use
both
his
hands
the
reference
to
both
hands
was
suspected
to
mean
the
elevation
of
the
host
and
this
suspicion
was
confirmed
by
the
omission
of
the
sentences
take
and
eat
this
in
remembrance
that
christ
died
for
thee
and
feed
on
him
in
thy
heart
by
faith
with
thanksgiving
and
drink
this
in
remembrance
that
christ
blood
was
shed
for
thee
and
be
thankful
from
the
words
of
administration
on
more
general
grounds
too
strong
objection
was
taken
to
the
book
and
on
july
there
occurred
the
famous
riot
in
giles
which
has
become
connected
with
the
name
of
jennie
geddes
the
objection
was
not
in
any
sense
to
read
prayers
in
themselves
the
book
of
common
order
had
been
read
in
giles
that
very
morning
the
difficulty
lay
in
the
particular
book
and
it
is
notable
that
the
cries
which
have
come
down
to
us
as
prefacing
the
riot
are
all
indicative
of
a
suspected
attempt
to
reintroduce
roman
catholicism
the
mass
is
entered
upon
us
baal
is
in
the
church
darest
thou
sing
mass
in
my
lug
the
privy
council
was
negligent
in
punishing
the
rioters
and
it
soon
became
evident
that
they
had
public
opinion
behind
them
alexander
henderson
who
ministered
to
a
fifeshire
congregation
in
the
old
norman
church
of
leuchars
and
whom
the
king
was
to
meet
in
other
circumstances
issued
a
respectful
and
moderate
protest
in
which
he
did
not
deal
with
the
particular
points
at
issue
but
asserted
the
ecclesiastical
independence
of
scotland
riots
continued
to
disturb
edinburgh
and
charles
was
impotent
to
suppress
them
he
refused
henderson
supplication
its
supporters
drew
up
a
second
petition
boldly
asking
that
the
bishops
should
be
tried
as
the
real
authors
of
the
disturbances
and
in
november
they
chose
a
body
of
commissioners
to
represent
them
these
commissioners
and
some
of
them
are
known
in
scottish
history
as
the
tables
the
name
being
applied
to
several
different
bodies
charles
replied
to
the
second
petition
in
wrathful
terms
and
it
was
decided
to
revive
the
national
covenant
of
to
renounce
popery
it
had
been
drawn
up
under
fear
of
a
popish
plot
and
was
itself
an
expansion
of
the
covenant
of
to
it
was
now
added
a
declaration
suited
to
immediate
necessities
on
the
and
march
it
was
signed
by
vast
multitudes
in
the
churchyard
of
greyfriars
in
edinburgh
and
it
continued
to
be
signed
sometimes
under
pressure
throughout
the
land
hamilton
charles
agent
in
scotland
was
quite
unable
to
meet
the
situation
in
the
end
charles
had
to
agree
to
the
meeting
of
a
general
assembly
in
glasgow
in
november
hamilton
the
high
commissioner
attempted
to
obtain
the
ejection
of
laymen
and
to
create
a
division
among
his
opponents
when
he
failed
in
this
he
dissolved
the
assembly
in
the
king
name
at
the
instance
of
henderson
supported
by
argyll
the
assembly
refused
to
acknowledge
itself
dissolved
and
proceeded
to
abolish
episcopacy
and
the
presbyterian
form
of
church
government
the
king
on
his
part
began
to
concert
measures
with
his
privy
council
for
the
subjugation
of
scotland
the
committee
on
scotch
affairs
of
the
english
privy
council
was
obviously
unconstitutional
but
matters
were
fast
drifting
towards
civil
war
and
it
was
no
time
to
consider
constitutional
niceties
it
is
much
more
important
that
the
committee
was
divided
and
useless
wentworth
writing
from
ireland
advised
the
king
to
maintain
a
firm
attitude
but
not
to
provoke
an
outbreak
of
war
at
so
inconvenient
a
moment
charles
again
attempted
a
compromise
he
offered
to
withdraw
laud
unlucky
the
new
canons
and
even
the
articles
of
perth
and
to
limit
the
power
of
the
bishops
and
he
asked
the
people
to
sign
the
covenant
of
on
which
the
new
covenant
was
based
but
which
of
course
contained
no
reference
to
immediate
difficulties
but
it
was
too
late
the
sentiment
of
religious
independence
had
become
united
to
the
old
feeling
of
national
independence
and
war
was
inevitable
the
scots
were
fortunate
in
their
leaders
in
the
end
of
there
returned
to
scotland
from
germany
alexander
leslie
the
great
soldier
who
had
fought
for
protestantism
under
gustavus
adolphus
in
february
he
took
command
of
the
army
of
the
covenant
which
had
been
largely
reinforced
by
veterans
from
the
thirty
years
war
a
more
attractive
personality
than
leslie
was
that
of
the
young
earl
of
montrose
who
had
attached
himself
with
enthusiasm
to
the
national
cause
and
had
attempted
to
convert
the
people
of
aberdeen
to
covenanting
principles
charles
on
his
part
asserted
that
his
throne
was
in
danger
and
that
the
scottish
preparations
constituted
a
menace
to
the
kingdom
of
england
and
so
attempted
to
rouse
enthusiasm
for
himself
while
the
king
was
preparing
to
reinforce
the
loyalist
marquis
of
huntly
at
aberdeen
the
news
came
that
the
garrisons
of
edinburgh
and
dunbarton
had
surrendered
to
the
insurgents
march
who
a
few
days
later
seized
the
regalia
at
dalkeith
on
march
aberdeen
fell
into
the
hands
of
montrose
and
leslie
and
huntly
was
soon
practically
a
prisoner
charles
had
by
this
time
reached
york
and
it
was
now
evident
that
he
had
entirely
miscalculated
the
strength
of
the
enemy
he
had
hoped
to
subdue
scotland
through
hamilton
and
huntly
he
now
saw
that
if
scotland
was
to
be
conquered
at
all
it
must
be
through
an
english
army
the
first
blood
in
the
civil
war
was
shed
near
turriff
in
aberdeenshire
may
where
some
of
huntly
supporters
gained
a
slight
success
after
which
the
city
of
aberdeen
fell
into
their
hands
for
some
ten
days
when
it
was
reoccupied
by
the
covenanters
meanwhile
charles
and
leslie
had
been
facing
each
other
near
berwick
the
former
unwilling
to
risk
his
raw
levies
against
leslie
trained
soldiers
while
the
covenanters
were
not
desirous
of
entering
into
a
war
in
which
they
might
find
the
whole
strength
of
england
ultimately
arrayed
against
them
on
the
june
the
two
parties
entered
into
the
pacification
of
berwick
in
accordance
with
which
both
armies
were
to
be
disbanded
and
charles
promised
to
allow
a
free
general
assembly
and
a
free
parliament
to
govern
scotland
while
the
pacification
was
being
signed
at
berwick
a
battle
was
in
progress
at
aberdeen
where
on
june
montrose
gained
a
victory
at
the
bridge
of
dee
over
the
earl
of
aboyne
the
eldest
son
of
the
marquis
of
huntly
for
the
third
time
montrose
spared
the
city
of
aberdeen
and
scotland
settled
down
to
a
brief
period
of
peace
it
was
clear
that
the
pacification
was
only
a
truce
for
no
exact
terms
had
been
agreed
upon
and
both
sides
thoroughly
distrusted
each
other
disputes
immediately
arose
about
the
constitution
of
parliament
and
the
assembly
charles
refused
to
rescind
the
acts
constituting
episcopacy
legal
and
it
is
clear
that
he
never
intended
to
keep
his
promise
to
the
scots
who
on
their
part
were
too
suspicious
of
his
good
faith
to
carry
out
their
part
of
the
agreement
in
the
end
assembly
and
parliament
alike
abolished
episcopacy
and
parliament
passed
several
acts
to
ensure
its
own
supremacy
charles
refused
to
assent
to
these
acts
and
prorogued
parliament
from
november
to
june
the
result
of
the
king
evident
disinclination
to
implement
the
treaty
of
berwick
was
an
interesting
attempt
to
undo
the
work
of
the
preceding
century
by
a
reversion
to
the
old
policy
of
a
french
alliance
it
was
of
course
impossible
thus
to
turn
back
and
richelieu
met
the
scottish
offers
with
a
decisive
rebuff
while
the
fact
of
these
treasonable
negotiations
became
known
to
charles
and
embittered
the
already
bitter
controversy
a
new
attempt
at
negotiation
failed
and
in
june
the
second
bishops
war
began
as
usual
the
north
suffered
especially
from
the
fierceness
of
the
earl
of
argyll
who
disliked
the
more
moderate
policy
advocated
by
montrose
the
king
english
difficulties
were
increasing
and
the
scots
had
now
many
sympathizers
among
englishmen
who
looked
upon
them
as
fighting
for
the
same
cause
of
protestantism
and
constitutional
government
in
august
the
scots
invaded
england
for
the
first
time
since
the
minority
of
mary
stuart
and
on
august
they
defeated
a
portion
of
the
king
army
at
newburn
a
ford
near
newcastle
the
town
was
immediately
occupied
and
from
newcastle
the
invaders
advanced
to
the
tees
and
seized
durham
charles
was
forced
a
second
time
to
give
way
in
october
he
agreed
that
the
scottish
army
of
occupation
should
be
paid
until
the
english
parliament
which
he
was
about
to
summon
might
make
a
final
arrangement
by
parliament
alone
could
the
scots
be
paid
and
thus
by
a
strange
irony
of
fate
the
occupation
of
the
northern
counties
by
a
scottish
army
was
for
the
time
the
best
guarantee
of
english
liberties
there
were
however
points
on
which
the
scottish
army
and
the
english
parliament
found
it
difficult
to
agree
and
it
was
not
till
august
that
the
scots
recrossed
the
tweed
charles
who
hoped
to
enlist
the
sympathy
of
the
scots
in
his
struggle
with
the
english
parliament
paid
a
second
visit
to
edinburgh
where
he
gave
his
assent
to
the
abolition
of
episcopacy
and
to
the
repeal
of
the
acts
which
had
given
rise
to
the
dispute
but
it
became
evident
that
the
parliament
and
not
the
king
was
to
bear
rule
in
scotland
the
stay
in
edinburgh
was
marked
by
what
is
known
as
the
incident
a
mysterious
plot
to
capture
argyll
and
hamilton
who
was
now
the
ally
of
argyll
it
was
supposed
that
the
king
was
cognizant
of
the
plan
he
had
to
defend
himself
from
the
accusation
and
was
declared
guiltless
in
the
matter
at
the
time
of
the
incident
argyll
fled
but
soon
returned
and
charles
had
to
yield
to
him
in
all
things
parliament
under
argyll
appointed
all
officials
argyll
himself
was
made
a
marquis
and
leslie
became
earl
of
leven
there
was
a
general
amnesty
and
among
those
who
obtained
their
liberty
was
the
earl
of
montrose
who
had
been
imprisoned
in
may
for
making
terms
with
the
king
in
november
charles
left
scotland
for
london
to
face
the
english
parliament
he
can
scarcely
have
hoped
for
scottish
aid
and
when
a
few
months
later
he
was
on
the
verge
of
hostilities
and
made
a
request
for
assistance
it
was
twice
refused
with
the
general
course
of
the
great
rebellion
we
are
not
here
concerned
it
is
important
for
our
purpose
to
notice
that
it
affected
scotland
in
two
ways
the
course
of
events
converted
on
the
one
hand
the
episcopalian
party
into
a
royalist
party
and
placed
at
its
head
the
covenanter
montrose
on
the
other
hand
the
national
covenant
was
transformed
into
the
solemn
league
and
covenant
which
had
for
its
aim
the
establishment
of
presbytery
in
england
as
well
as
in
scotland
this
will
o
the
wisp
of
covenanted
uniformity
led
the
scottish
church
into
somewhat
strange
places
as
early
as
january
montrose
had
offered
to
strike
a
blow
for
the
king
in
scotland
but
charles
would
not
take
the
responsibility
of
beginning
the
strife
in
august
negotiations
began
for
the
extension
of
the
covenant
to
england
the
solemn
league
and
covenant
which
provided
for
the
abolition
of
episcopacy
in
england
was
adopted
by
the
convention
of
estates
at
edinburgh
on
august
and
in
the
following
month
it
passed
both
houses
of
parliament
in
england
and
was
taken
both
by
the
house
of
commons
and
by
the
assembly
of
divines
at
westminster
its
only
ultimate
results
were
the
substitution
in
scotland
of
the
westminster
confession
of
faith
catechisms
and
directory
for
public
worship
in
place
of
the
older
scottish
documents
and
the
approximation
of
scottish
presbytery
to
english
puritanism
involving
a
distinct
departure
from
the
ideals
of
the
scottish
reformation
and
the
introduction
into
scotland
of
a
form
of
sabbatarianism
which
has
come
to
be
regarded
as
distinctively
scottish
but
which
owes
its
origin
historically
to
english
nonconformity
its
immediate
effects
were
the
predominance
of
presbytery
in
england
and
the
crossing
of
the
tweed
in
january
by
a
scottish
army
in
the
pay
of
the
english
parliament
the
part
taken
by
the
scottish
army
in
the
war
was
not
unimportant
in
april
they
aided
fairfax
in
the
siege
of
york
in
july
they
took
an
honourable
share
in
the
battle
of
marston
moor
they
were
responsible
for
the
uxbridge
proposals
which
provided
for
peace
on
the
basis
of
a
presbyterian
settlement
in
june
they
advanced
southwards
to
mansfield
and
after
the
surrender
of
carlisle
on
june
and
its
occupation
by
a
scottish
garrison
leven
proceeded
to
alcester
and
thereafter
laid
siege
to
hereford
an
attempt
which
events
in
scotland
forced
him
to
abandon
finally
in
may
the
king
surrendered
to
the
scottish
army
at
newark
which
had
been
invested
by
leven
since
the
preceding
november
while
the
scottish
army
was
thus
aiding
the
parliamentary
cause
the
earl
of
montrose
had
created
an
important
diversion
on
the
king
side
in
scotland
itself
in
april
he
occupied
dumfries
and
made
an
unsuccessful
attempt
on
the
scottish
lowlands
in
may
charles
conferred
on
him
a
marquisate
and
in
august
he
prepared
to
renew
the
struggle
to
his
old
foes
the
gordons
he
first
looked
for
assistance
but
was
finally
compelled
to
raise
his
forces
in
the
highlands
and
to
obtain
irish
aid
on
september
he
gained
his
first
victory
at
tippermuir
near
perth
on
which
he
had
marched
with
his
highland
host
from
perth
he
marched
on
aberdeen
gaining
some
reinforcements
from
the
northern
gentry
and
in
particular
from
the
earl
of
airlie
once
again
montrose
fought
a
battle
which
delivered
the
city
of
aberdeen
into
his
power
september
but
now
he
was
unwilling
or
unable
to
protect
the
captured
town
which
was
cruelly
ravaged
from
aberdeen
montrose
proceeded
by
rothiemurchus
to
blair
athole
but
suddenly
turned
backwards
to
aberdeenshire
where
he
defended
fyvie
castle
slipped
past
argyll
and
again
reached
blair
athole
the
enemies
of
argyll
crowded
to
his
banner
but
his
army
was
still
small
when
in
december
he
made
his
descent
upon
argyll
and
reached
the
castle
of
inverary
from
inverary
he
went
northwards
ravaging
as
he
went
till
he
found
at
loch
ness
that
there
was
an
army
of
men
under
the
earl
of
seaforth
prepared
to
resist
his
advance
while
argyll
was
behind
him
at
inverlochy
although
argyll
army
considerably
outnumbered
his
own
montrose
turned
southwards
and
made
a
rapid
dash
at
argyll
forces
as
they
lay
at
inverlochy
and
won
a
complete
victory
the
news
of
which
dispersed
seaforth
men
and
enabled
montrose
to
invite
charles
to
a
country
which
lay
at
his
mercy
at
elgin
he
was
joined
by
the
heir
of
the
marquis
of
huntly
his
forces
increased
and
the
excommunication
which
the
church
immediately
published
against
him
seemed
of
but
little
importance
on
april
he
seized
dundee
and
on
may
won
a
fresh
victory
at
auldearn
which
was
followed
in
rapid
succession
by
a
victory
at
alford
in
july
and
in
august
by
the
crowning
mercy
of
kilsyth
which
made
him
master
of
the
situation
and
forced
leven
to
raise
the
siege
of
hereford
from
kilsyth
he
marched
to
glasgow
where
both
the
highlanders
and
the
gordons
began
to
desert
him
from
england
leven
sent
david
leslie
to
meet
montrose
as
he
marched
by
the
lothians
into
the
border
counties
on
september
just
one
year
after
his
victory
at
aberdeen
montrose
was
completely
defeated
at
philiphaugh
he
escaped
but
his
power
was
broken
and
he
was
unable
henceforth
to
take
any
important
share
in
the
war
when
charles
surrendered
himself
to
the
scots
in
may
his
friends
in
scotland
were
helpless
and
he
had
to
meet
the
presbyterian
leaders
without
any
hope
beyond
that
of
being
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
differences
of
opinion
between
presbyterians
and
independents
which
were
fast
assuming
critical
importance
the
king
held
at
newcastle
a
conference
with
alexander
henderson
which
led
to
no
definite
result
in
the
end
the
scots
offered
to
adopt
the
king
cause
if
he
would
accept
presbyterianism
this
he
declined
to
do
and
his
refusal
left
the
scots
no
choice
except
keeping
him
a
prisoner
or
surrendering
him
to
his
english
subjects
they
owed
him
no
gratitude
and
while
it
might
be
chivalrous
it
could
scarcely
be
expedient
to
retain
his
person
while
he
was
unwilling
to
accede
to
their
conditions
they
were
powerless
to
give
him
any
help
he
was
therefore
handed
over
to
the
commissioners
of
the
english
parliament
and
the
scots
on
the
january
returned
home
having
been
paid
as
the
price
of
the
king
surrender
the
money
promised
them
by
the
english
parliament
when
they
entered
into
the
struggle
in
in
the
end
of
the
scots
again
entered
into
the
long
series
of
negotiations
with
the
king
when
charles
was
a
prisoner
at
newport
and
while
he
was
arranging
terms
with
the
english
he
entered
into
a
secret
agreement
with
commissioners
from
scotland
the
engagement
as
it
was
called
embodied
the
conditions
which
charles
had
refused
at
newcastle
the
recognition
of
presbytery
in
scotland
and
its
establishment
in
england
for
three
years
the
king
being
allowed
toleration
for
his
own
form
of
worship
the
engagement
was
by
no
means
unanimously
carried
in
the
scottish
parliament
and
its
results
were
disastrous
to
charles
himself
it
caused
the
english
parliament
to
pass
the
vote
of
no
addresses
and
the
second
civil
war
which
it
helped
to
provoke
had
a
share
in
bringing
about
his
death
the
duke
of
hamilton
led
a
small
army
into
england
where
in
august
it
was
totally
defeated
by
cromwell
at
preston
meanwhile
the
hamilton
party
had
lost
power
in
scotland
and
when
cromwell
entered
scotland
argyll
who
had
opposed
the
engagement
willingly
agreed
to
his
conditions
and
accepted
the
aid
of
three
english
regiments
in
the
events
of
the
next
six
months
scotland
had
no
part
nor
lot
the
responsibility
for
the
king
death
rests
on
the
english
government
alone
the
news
of
the
execution
of
the
king
was
at
once
followed
by
the
fall
of
argyll
and
his
party
the
scots
had
no
sympathy
with
english
republicanism
and
they
were
alarmed
by
the
growth
of
independency
in
england
on
february
charles
ii
was
proclaimed
king
of
great
britain
france
and
ireland
and
the
scots
declared
themselves
ready
to
defend
his
cause
by
blood
if
only
he
would
take
the
covenant
this
the
young
king
refused
to
do
while
he
had
hopes
of
success
in
ireland
meanwhile
three
of
his
most
loyal
friends
perished
on
the
scaffold
the
english
who
held
the
duke
of
hamilton
as
a
prisoner
put
him
to
death
on
march
and
on
the
day
of
the
same
month
the
marquis
of
huntly
was
beheaded
at
edinburgh
on
april
montrose
who
had
collected
a
small
army
and
taken
the
field
in
the
northern
highlands
was
defeated
at
carbisdale
and
taken
prisoner
on
the
may
he
was
hanged
in
edinburgh
and
with
his
death
the
story
is
deprived
of
its
hero
the
pressure
of
misfortune
finally
drove
charles
to
accept
the
scottish
offers
even
while
montrose
was
fighting
his
last
battle
his
young
master
was
negotiating
with
the
covenanters
conferences
were
held
at
breda
in
the
spring
of
and
charles
landed
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
spey
on
the
july
having
taken
the
covenant
in
the
middle
of
the
same
month
cromwell
crossed
the
tweed
at
the
head
of
an
english
army
the
scots
under
leven
and
david
leslie
took
up
a
position
near
edinburgh
and
after
a
month
fruitless
skirmishing
cromwell
had
to
retire
to
dunbar
whither
leslie
followed
him
by
a
clever
manoeuvre
leslie
intercepted
cromwell
retreat
on
berwick
while
he
also
seized
doon
hill
an
eminence
commanding
dunbar
the
parliamentary
committee
under
whose
authority
leslie
was
acting
forced
him
to
make
an
attack
to
prevent
cromwell
force
from
escaping
by
sea
the
details
of
the
battle
have
been
disputed
and
the
most
convincing
account
is
that
given
by
firth
in
his
cromwell
when
leslie
left
the
doon
hill
his
left
became
shut
in
between
the
hill
and
the
steep
ravine
of
the
brock
burn
while
his
centre
had
not
sufficient
room
to
move
cromwell
therefore
after
a
feint
on
the
left
concentrated
his
forces
against
leslie
right
and
shattered
it
the
rout
was
complete
and
leslie
had
to
retreat
to
stirling
while
the
lowlands
fell
into
cromwell
hands
cromwell
was
conciliatory
and
a
considerable
proportion
of
presbyterians
took
up
an
attitude
hostile
to
the
king
claims
the
supporters
of
charles
were
known
as
resolutioners
or
engagers
and
his
opponents
as
protesters
or
remonstrants
the
consequence
was
that
the
old
royalists
and
episcopalians
began
to
rejoin
charles
before
the
battle
of
dunbar
september
charles
had
been
really
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
the
covenanters
who
had
ruled
him
with
a
rod
of
iron
as
the
stricter
presbyterians
withdrew
and
their
places
were
filled
by
the
malignants
whom
they
had
excluded
from
the
king
service
the
personal
importance
of
charles
increased
on
january
he
was
crowned
at
scone
and
in
the
following
summer
he
took
up
a
position
near
stirling
with
leslie
as
commander
of
his
army
cromwell
outmanoeuvred
leslie
and
seized
perth
and
the
royal
forces
retaliated
by
the
invasion
of
england
which
ended
in
the
defeat
of
worcester
on
september
exactly
one
year
after
dunbar
the
king
escaped
and
fled
to
france
scotland
was
now
unable
to
resist
monk
whom
cromwell
had
left
behind
him
when
he
went
southwards
to
defeat
charles
at
worcester
on
the
august
he
captured
stirling
and
on
the
the
committee
of
estates
was
seized
at
alyth
and
carried
off
to
london
there
was
no
further
attempt
at
opposition
and
all
scotland
for
the
first
time
since
the
reign
of
edward
i
was
in
military
occupation
by
english
troops
the
property
of
the
leading
supporters
of
charles
ii
was
confiscated
in
the
general
assembly
was
reduced
to
pleading
that
we
were
an
ecclesiastical
synod
a
spiritual
court
of
jesus
christ
which
meddled
not
with
anything
civil
but
their
unwonted
humility
was
of
no
avail
to
save
them
an
earlier
victim
than
the
assembly
was
the
scottish
parliament
it
was
decided
in
that
scotland
should
be
incorporated
with
england
and
from
february
of
that
year
till
the
restoration
the
kingdom
of
scotland
ceased
to
exist
the
instrument
of
government
of
gave
scotland
thirty
members
in
the
british
parliament
twenty
were
allotted
to
the
shires
one
to
each
of
the
larger
shires
and
one
to
each
of
nine
groups
of
less
important
shires
there
were
also
eight
groups
of
burghs
each
group
electing
one
member
and
two
members
were
returned
by
the
city
of
edinburgh
between
and
scotland
was
governed
by
parliamentary
commissioners
and
from
onwards
by
a
special
council
the
court
of
session
was
abolished
and
its
place
taken
by
a
commission
of
justice
the
actual
union
dates
from
when
it
was
ratified
by
the
supreme
council
of
the
commonwealth
of
england
but
scotland
was
under
english
rule
from
the
battle
of
worcester
the
wise
policy
of
allowing
freedom
of
trade
like
the
improvement
in
the
administration
of
justice
failed
to
reconcile
the
scots
to
the
union
and
to
the
end
it
required
a
military
force
to
maintain
the
new
government
as
scotland
had
no
share
in
the
execution
of
charles
i
so
it
had
none
in
the
restoration
of
his
son
the
committee
of
estates
which
met
after
the
of
may
was
not
lacking
in
loyalty
all
traces
of
the
union
were
swept
away
and
the
pressure
of
the
new
navigation
act
was
severely
felt
in
contrast
to
the
freedom
of
trade
that
had
been
the
great
boon
of
the
commonwealth
but
worse
evils
were
in
store
the
covenanted
monarch
was
determined
to
restore
episcopacy
in
scotland
and
for
this
purpose
he
employed
as
a
tool
the
notorious
james
sharpe
who
had
been
sent
up
to
london
to
plead
the
cause
of
presbytery
with
monk
sharpe
returned
to
scotland
in
the
spring
of
as
archbishop
of
andrews
parliament
met
by
royal
authority
and
passed
a
general
act
rescissory
which
rendered
void
all
acts
passed
since
the
episcopal
form
of
church
government
was
immediately
established
the
privy
council
received
enlarged
powers
and
was
again
completely
subservient
to
the
king
the
execution
of
argyll
atoned
for
the
death
of
montrose
in
the
eyes
of
royalists
and
two
notable
ecclesiastical
politicians
johnston
of
warriston
and
james
guthrie
were
also
put
to
death
an
indemnity
act
was
passed
but
many
men
found
that
the
pardon
had
its
price
on
october
an
act
was
passed
ordering
recusant
ministers
to
leave
their
parishes
and
the
council
improved
on
the
english
five
mile
act
by
ordering
that
no
recusant
minister
should
on
pain
of
treason
reside
within
twenty
miles
of
his
parish
within
six
miles
of
edinburgh
or
any
cathedral
town
or
within
three
miles
of
any
royal
burgh
a
court
of
high
commission
which
had
been
established
by
james
vi
in
was
again
entrusted
with
all
religious
cases
the
effect
of
these
harsh
measures
was
to
rouse
the
insurrections
which
are
the
most
notable
feature
of
the
reign
in
the
covenanters
were
defeated
at
the
battle
of
pentland
or
rullion
green
and
those
who
were
suspected
of
a
share
in
the
rising
were
subjected
to
examination
under
torture
which
now
became
one
of
the
normal
features
of
charles
brutal
government
prisoners
were
hanged
or
sent
as
slaves
to
the
plantations
in
an
indulgence
was
passed
permitting
presbyterian
services
under
certain
conditions
but
in
parliament
passed
a
conventicle
act
making
it
a
capital
crime
to
preach
expound
scripture
or
pray
at
any
unlicensed
meeting
on
may
sharpe
was
assassinated
near
andrews
the
murderers
escaped
and
some
of
them
joined
the
covenanters
of
the
west
the
government
had
determined
to
put
a
stop
to
the
meetings
of
conventicles
and
had
chosen
for
this
purpose
john
graham
of
claverhouse
on
the
june
claverhouse
was
defeated
at
drumclog
but
eleven
days
later
he
routed
the
covenanting
army
at
bothwell
bridge
and
took
over
a
thousand
prisoners
only
seven
were
executed
but
the
others
were
imprisoned
in
greyfriars
churchyard
and
a
large
number
of
them
were
sold
as
plantation
slaves
a
small
rising
at
aird
moss
in
ayrshire
in
was
easily
suppressed

parliament
prescribed
as
a
test
the
disavowal
of
the
national
covenant
of

the
solemn
league

covenant

it
declared
that
any
attempt
to
alter
the
succession
involved
the
subjects
in
perjury
and
rebellion
in
connection
with
the
test
act
an
opportunity
was
found
for
convicting
the
earl
of
argyll
of
treason
his
property
was
confiscated

he
himself
was
allowed
to
escape
the
last
years
of
the
reign
under

were
marked
by
exceptional
cruelty
in

with
the
religious
persecutions
the
expeditions
of

wigtown
martyrs
and
the
horrible
cruelties
of

given
to
these
years
the
title
of
the
killing
time
the
scottish
parliament
welcomed
king
james

with
fulsome
adulation
but
the
new
king
was
scarcely
seated
on

throne
before
a
rebellion
broke
out
the
earl
of
argyll
adopted
the
cause
of
monmouth
landed

failure
nobody
joined
his
standard
and
he
himself
failing
to
make
good
his
retreat
was
captured
and
executed
without
a
new
trial
the
parliament
again
enforced
the
test
act
and
renewed
the
conventicle
act
making
it
a
capital
offence
even
to
be
present
at

the
persecutions

the

had
been
restored
in
chapter
xi
the
union
of
the
parliaments
on
april
a
convention
of
the
estates
of
scotland
met
to
consider
the
new
situation
which
had
been
created
by
the
course
of
events
in
england
they
had
no
difficulty
in
determining
their
course
of
action
nor
any
scruples
about
deposing
james
who
was
declared
to
have
forfeited
his
right
to
the
crown
a
list
was
drawn
up
of
the
misdeeds
they
included
erecting
schools
and
societies
of
jesuits
making
papists
officers
of
state
taxation
and
the
maintenance
of
a
standing
army
without
consent
of
parliament
illegal
imprisonments
fines
and
forfeitures
and
interference
with
the
charters
of
burghs
the
crown
was
then
offered
to
william
and
mary
but
upon
certain
strictly
defined
conditions
all
the
acts
of
the
late
king
which
were
included
in
the
list
of
his
offences
must
be
recognized
as
illegal
no
roman
catholic
might
be
king
or
queen
of
scotland
and
the
new
sovereigns
must
agree
to
the
of
presbytery
as
the
national
religion
it
was
obvious
that
the
nation
was
not
unanimous
to
the
lords
of
convention
was
claverhouse
spoke
ere
the
king
crown
go
down
there
are
crowns
to
be
broke
the
opponents
of
the
revolution
settlement
consisted
mainly
of
the
old
royalist
and
episcopalian
party
the
representatives
of
those
who
had
followed
montrose
to
victory
and
the
supporters
of
the
restoration
government
as
the
great
rebellion
had
made
royalists
of
the
scottish
episcopalians
so
the
revolution
could
not
but
convert
them
into
jacobites
their
leader
was
james
graham
of
claverhouse
who
retreated
from
edinburgh
to
the
north
to
prepare
for
a
campaign
against
the
new
government
the
discontent
was
not
confined
to
the
episcopalian
party
such
roman
catholics
as
there
were
in
scotland
at
the
time
were
prepared
to
take
up
arms
for
a
stuart
king
who
was
a
devout
adherent
of
their
religion
moreover
the
presbyterians
themselves
were
not
united
a
party
which
was
to
grow
in
strength
and
which
now
included
a
considerable
number
of
extreme
presbyterians
still
longed
in
spite
of
their
experience
of
charles
ii
for
a
covenanted
king
and
looked
with
great
distrust
upon
william
and
mary
the
triumphant
party
of
moderate
presbyterians
who
probably
represented
most
faithfully
the
feeling
of
the
nation
acted
throughout
with
considerable
wisdom
the
acceptance
of
the
crown
converted
the
convention
into
a
parliament
and
the
estates
set
themselves
to
obtain
in
the
first
place
their
own
freedom
from
the
tyranny
of
the
committee
known
as
the
lords
of
the
articles
through
which
james
vi
and
his
successors
had
kept
the
parliament
in
subjection
william
was
unwilling
to
lose
entirely
this
method
of
controlling
his
new
subjects
but
he
had
to
give
way
the
parliament
rescinded
the
act
of
charles
ii
asserting
his
majesty
supremacy
over
all
persons
and
in
all
causes
ecclesiastical
as
inconsistent
with
the
establishment
of
church
government
now
desired
but
in
the
military
crisis
which
threatened
them
they
proceeded
no
further
than
to
bring
in
an
act
abolishing
prelacy
and
all
superiority
of
office
in
the
church
of
scotland
while
william
first
parliament
was
debating
his
enemies
were
entering
upon
a
struggle
which
was
destined
to
be
brief
edinburgh
castle
held
out
for
king
james
till
june
when
its
captain
the
duke
of
gordon
capitulated
graham
of
claverhouse
now
viscount
dundee
had
collected
an
army
of
highlanders
against
whom
william
sent
general
mackay
a
scotsman
who
had
served
in
holland
mackay
followed
dundee
through
the
highlands
to
elgin
and
on
to
inverness
and
finally
after
many
wanderings
the
two
armies
met
in
the
pass
of
killiecrankie
dundee
and
his
highlanders
were
victorious
but
dundee
himself
was
killed
in
the
battle
and
his
death
proved
a
fatal
blow
to
the
jacobite
cause
after
some
delay
mackay
was
able
to
attain
the
object
for
which
the
battle
had
been
fought
the
possession
of
blair
athole
castle
the
military
resistance
soon
came
to
an
end
the
ecclesiastical
settlement
followed
the
suppression
of
the
rebellion
the
deprivation
of
nonjuring
clergymen
had
been
proceeding
since
the
establishment
of
the
new
government
and
in
an
act
was
passed
restoring
to
their
parishes
the
presbyterian
clergy
who
had
been
ejected
under
charles
ii
a
small
temporary
provision
was
made
for
their
successors
who
were
now
in
turn
expelled
on
the
may
the
parliament
adopted
the
confession
of
faith
although
it
refused
to
be
committed
to
the
covenant
the
presbyterian
form
of
church
government
was
established
but
king
william
succeeded
in
maintaining
some
check
on
the
general
assembly
and
toleration
was
granted
to
such
episcopalian
dissenters
as
were
willing
to
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
on
the
other
hand
acceptance
of
the
confession
of
faith
was
made
a
test
for
professors
in
the
universities
the
changes
were
carried
out
with
little
disturbance
to
the
peace
there
was
no
blood
spilt
and
except
for
some
rough
usage
of
episcopalians
in
the
west
known
as
the
rabbling
of
the
curates
there
was
nothing
in
the
way
of
outrage
or
insult
the
credit
of
the
settlement
belongs
to
william
carstares
afterwards
principal
of
the
university
of
edinburgh
whose
tact
and
wisdom
overcame
many
difficulties
the
personal
union
of
scotland
and
england
had
created
no
special
difficulties
while
both
countries
were
under
the
rule
of
an
absolute
monarch
the
policy
of
both
was
alike
because
it
was
guided
by
one
supreme
ruler
but
the
accession
of
a
constitutional
king
with
a
parliamentary
title
at
once
created
many
problems
difficult
of
solution
and
made
a
more
complete
union
absolutely
necessary
the
union
of
was
thus
the
natural
consequence
of
the
revolution
of
although
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
scrupulous
care
was
taken
alike
by
the
new
king
and
by
his
english
parliament
to
recognize
the
existence
of
scotland
as
a
separate
kingdom
the
scottish
parliament
which
regarded
itself
as
the
ruler
of
the
country
found
itself
hampered
and
restricted
by
william
action
it
was
allowed
no
voice
on
questions
of
foreign
policy
and
its
conduct
of
home
affairs
met
with
not
infrequent
interference
which
roused
the
indignation
of
scottish
politicians
and
especially
of
the
section
which
followed
fletcher
of
saltoun
several
causes
combined
to
add
to
the
unpopularity
which
william
had
acquired
through
the
occasional
friction
with
the
parliament
scotland
had
ceased
to
have
any
interest
in
the
war
and
its
prolongation
constituted
a
standing
grievance
of
which
the
partisans
of
the
stuarts
were
not
slow
to
avail
themselves
there
were
two
events
in
particular
which
roused
widespread
resentment
in
scotland
these
were
the
massacre
of
glencoe
and
the
failure
of
the
scheme
for
colonizing
the
isthmus
of
darien
the
story
of
glencoe
has
been
often
told
the
december
had
been
appointed
as
the
latest
day
on
which
the
government
would
receive
the
submission
of
the
highland
chiefs
macdonald
of
glencoe
delayed
till
the
last
moment
and
then
proceeded
to
where
a
fortress
had
just
been
erected
to
take
the
oath
in
the
presence
of
its
commander
who
had
no
power
to
receive
it
from
he
had
to
go
to
inverary
to
take
the
oath
before
the
sheriff
of
argyll
and
he
did
so
on
the
january
the
six
days
delay
placed
him
and
his
clan
in
the
power
of
men
who
were
unlikely
to
show
any
mercy
to
the
name
of
macdonald
acting
under
instructions
from
king
william
the
nature
of
which
has
been
matter
of
dispute
campbell
of
glenlyon
acting
with
the
knowledge
of
breadalbane
and
sir
john
dalrymple
of
stair
the
secretary
of
state
and
as
their
tool
entered
the
pass
of
glencoe
on
the
february
the
macdonalds
trusting
in
the
assurances
which
had
been
given
by
the
government
seem
to
have
suspected
no
evil
from
this
armed
visit
of
their
traditional
enemies
the
campbells
and
received
them
with
hospitality
while
they
were
living
peaceably
all
possible
retreat
was
being
cut
off
from
the
unfortunate
macdonalds
by
the
closing
of
the
passes
and
on
the
effect
was
given
to
the
dastardly
scheme
it
failed
however
to
achieve
its
full
object
the
extirpation
of
the
clan
many
escaped
to
the
hills
but
the
chief
himself
and
over
thirty
others
were
murdered
in
cold
blood
the
news
of
the
massacre
roused
a
fierce
flame
of
indignation
not
only
in
the
highlands
but
throughout
the
lowlands
as
well
and
the
jacobites
did
not
fail
to
make
use
of
it
a
commission
was
appointed
to
enquire
into
the
circumstances
and
it
severely
censured
dalrymple
and
charged
breadalbane
with
treason
while
many
blamed
possibly
unjustly
the
king
himself
the
other
grievance
was
of
a
different
nature
about
william
paterson
the
founder
of
the
bank
of
england
suggested
the
formation
of
a
scottish
company
to
trade
to
africa
and
the
indies
it
was
originally
known
as
the
african
company
but
it
was
destined
to
be
popularly
remembered
by
the
name
of
its
most
notable
failure
the
darien
company
it
received
very
full
powers
from
the
scottish
parliament
powers
of
military
colonization
as
well
as
trading
privileges
these
powers
aroused
great
jealousy
and
indignation
in
england
and
the
house
of
commons
decided
that
as
the
company
had
its
headquarters
in
london
the
directors
were
guilty
of
high
crimes
and
misdemeanours
there
followed
a
failure
of
the
english
capital
on
which
the
promoters
had
reckoned
but
shares
to
the
value
of
on
which
was
paid
up
were
subscribed
in
scotland
at
first
the
company
was
a
prosperous
trading
concern
but
its
only
attempt
at
colonization
involved
it
in
ruin
paterson
wished
his
to
found
a
colony
in
the
isthmus
of
panama
and
to
attract
thither
the
whole
trade
of
north
and
south
america
the
ports
of
the
colony
were
to
be
open
to
ships
of
all
nations
in
the
end
of
twelve
hundred
scots
landed
on
the
shore
of
the
gulf
of
darien
without
organization
and
without
the
restraint
of
responsibility
to
any
government
they
soon
had
difficulties
with
their
spanish
neighbours
and
the
english
colonists
at
new
york
barbadoes
and
jamaica
were
warned
to
render
them
no
assistance
disease
and
famine
completed
the
tale
of
misery
and
the
first
colonists
deserted
their
posts
their
successors
who
arrived
to
find
empty
huts
surrounded
by
lonely
scottish
graves
were
soon
in
worse
plight
and
they
were
driven
out
by
a
band
of
spaniards
the
unfortunate
company
lingered
on
for
some
time
but
merely
as
traders
the
scots
blamed
the
king
for
their
failure
and
he
became
more
than
ever
unpopular
in
scotland
the
moral
of
the
whole
story
was
that
only
through
the
corporate
union
of
the
two
countries
could
trade
jealousies
and
the
danger
of
rival
schemes
of
colonization
be
avoided
in
the
reign
of
charles
ii
the
scots
who
felt
keenly
the
loss
of
the
freedom
of
trade
which
they
had
enjoyed
under
cromwell
had
themselves
broached
the
question
of
union
and
william
had
brought
it
forward
at
the
beginning
of
his
reign
it
was
however
reserved
for
his
successor
to
see
it
carried
in
march
the
king
died
the
death
of
william
ii
as
his
title
ran
in
the
kingdom
of
scotland
was
received
with
a
feeling
amounting
almost
to
satisfaction
the
first
english
parliament
of
queen
anne
agreed
to
the
appointment
of
commissioners
to
discuss
terms
of
union
and
the
estates
of
scotland
chose
representatives
to
meet
them
but
the
english
refused
to
give
freedom
of
trade
and
so
the
negotiations
broke
down
in
reply
the
scottish
parliament
removed
the
restrictions
on
the
import
of
wines
from
france
with
which
country
england
was
now
at
war
in
the
summer
of
the
scots
passed
an
act
of
security
which
invested
the
parliament
with
the
power
of
the
crown
in
case
of
the
queen
dying
without
heirs
and
entrusted
to
it
the
choice
of
a
protestant
sovereign
from
the
royal
line
it
refused
to
such
king
or
queen
if
also
sovereign
of
england
the
power
of
declaring
war
or
making
peace
without
the
consent
of
parliament
and
it
enacted
that
the
union
of
the
crowns
should
determine
after
the
queen
death
unless
scotland
was
admitted
to
equal
trade
and
navigation
privileges
with
england
further
the
act
provided
for
the
compulsory
training
of
every
scotsman
to
bear
arms
in
order
that
the
country
might
if
necessary
defend
its
independence
by
the
sword
the
queen
consent
to
the
act
of
security
was
refused
and
the
bitterness
of
the
national
feeling
was
accentuated
by
the
suspicion
of
a
jacobite
plot
parliament
had
been
adjourned
on
september
when
it
met
in
it
again
passed
the
act
of
security
and
an
important
section
began
to
argue
that
the
royal
assent
was
merely
a
usual
form
and
not
an
indispensable
authentication
of
an
act
for
some
time
it
seemed
as
if
the
two
countries
were
on
the
brink
of
war
but
as
the
union
of
the
crowns
had
been
rendered
possible
by
the
of
a
nation
who
could
accept
their
hereditary
enemy
as
their
hereditary
sovereign
so
now
queen
anne
advisers
resolved
with
patient
wisdom
to
secure
at
all
hazards
the
union
of
the
kingdoms
it
was
not
an
easy
task
even
in
england
for
there
could
be
no
union
without
complete
freedom
of
trade
and
many
englishmen
were
most
unwilling
to
yield
on
this
point
in
scotland
the
difficulties
to
be
overcome
were
much
greater
the
whole
nation
irrespective
of
politics
and
religion
felt
bitterly
the
indignity
of
surrendering
the
independent
existence
for
which
scotland
had
fought
for
four
hundred
years
it
could
not
but
be
difficult
to
reconcile
an
ancient
and
people
to
incorporation
with
a
larger
and
more
powerful
neighbour
and
the
whole
population
mourned
the
approaching
loss
of
their
parliament
and
their
autonomy
almost
every
section
had
special
reasons
for
opposing
the
measure
for
the
jacobites
an
act
of
union
meant
that
scotland
was
irretrievably
committed
to
the
hanoverian
succession
and
whatever
force
the
jacobites
might
be
able
to
raise
after
the
queen
death
must
take
action
in
the
shape
of
a
rebellion
against
the
government
it
deprived
them
of
all
hope
of
seizing
the
reins
of
power
and
of
using
the
machinery
of
government
in
scotland
for
the
good
of
their
cause
a
of
which
the
act
of
security
gave
considerable
chance
on
this
very
account
the
triumphant
presbyterians
were
anxious
to
carry
the
union
scheme
and
the
correspondence
of
the
electress
sophia
proves
that
the
negotiations
for
union
were
looked
upon
at
hanover
as
solely
an
important
factor
in
the
succession
controversy
but
the
recently
presbyterian
church
of
scotland
regarded
with
great
anxiety
a
union
with
an
episcopalian
country
and
hesitated
to
place
their
dearly
won
freedom
at
the
mercy
of
a
parliament
the
large
majority
of
whom
were
episcopalians
the
more
extreme
presbyterians
and
especially
the
cameronians
of
the
west
were
bitterly
opposed
to
the
project
they
protested
against
becoming
subject
to
a
parliament
in
whose
deliberations
the
english
bishops
had
an
important
voice
and
against
accepting
a
king
who
had
been
educated
as
a
lutheran
and
they
clamoured
for
covenanted
uniformity
and
a
covenanted
monarch
by
a
curious
irony
of
fate
the
scottish
episcopalians
were
forced
by
their
jacobite
leanings
to
act
with
the
extreme
presbyterians
and
to
oppose
the
scheme
of
amalgamation
with
an
episcopalian
country
the
legal
interest
was
strongly
against
a
proposal
that
might
reduce
the
importance
of
scots
law
and
of
scottish
lawyers
while
the
populace
of
edinburgh
were
furious
at
the
suggestion
of
a
union
whose
result
must
be
to
remove
at
once
one
of
the
glories
of
their
city
and
a
valuable
source
of
income
there
was
still
another
body
of
opponents
the
reign
of
william
had
been
remarkable
for
the
rise
of
political
parties
the
two
main
factions
were
known
as
williamites
and
cavaliers
and
in
addition
to
these
there
had
grown
up
a
patriot
or
country
party
it
was
brought
into
existence
by
the
enthusiasm
of
fletcher
of
saltoun
and
it
was
based
upon
an
antiquarian
revival
which
may
be
compared
with
the
mediæval
attempts
to
revive
the
republic
of
rome
the
aim
of
the
patriots
was
to
maintain
the
independence
of
scotland
and
they
attempted
to
show
that
the
scottish
crown
had
never
been
under
feudal
obligations
to
england
and
that
the
scottish
parliament
had
always
possessed
sovereign
rights
and
could
govern
independently
of
the
will
of
the
monarch
they
were
neither
jacobites
nor
hanoverians
but
they
held
that
if
the
foreign
domination
of
which
they
had
complained
under
william
were
to
continue
it
mattered
little
whether
it
emanated
from
germains
or
from
the
court
of
james
and
they
had
combined
with
the
jacobites
to
pass
the
act
of
security
such
was
the
complicated
situation
with
which
the
english
government
had
to
deal
their
first
step
was
to
advise
queen
anne
to
assent
to
the
act
of
security
and
so
to
conserve
the
dignity
and
of
the
scottish
parliament
commissioners
were
then
appointed
to
negotiate
for
a
union
no
attempt
was
made
to
conciliate
the
jacobites
for
no
attempt
could
have
met
with
any
kind
of
success
nor
did
the
commissioners
make
any
effort
to
satisfy
the
more
extreme
presbyterians
who
sullenly
refused
to
acknowledge
the
union
when
it
became
an
accomplished
fact
and
who
remained
to
hamper
the
government
when
the
jacobite
troubles
commenced
an
assurance
that
there
would
be
no
interference
with
the
church
of
scotland
as
by
law
established
and
a
guarantee
that
the
universities
would
be
maintained
in
their
satisfied
the
moderate
presbyterians
and
removed
their
scruples
unlike
james
vi
and
cromwell
the
advisers
of
queen
anne
declared
their
intention
of
preserving
the
independent
scots
law
and
the
independent
scottish
courts
of
justice
and
these
guarantees
weakened
the
arguments
of
the
patriot
party
but
above
all
the
english
proposals
won
the
support
of
the
commercial
interest
in
scotland
by
conceding
freedom
of
trade
in
a
complete
form
they
agreed
that
all
parts
of
the
united
kingdom
of
great
britain
be
under
the
same
regulations
prohibitions
and
restrictions
and
liable
to
equal
impositions
and
duties
for
export
and
import
the
adjustment
of
financial
obligations
was
admitted
to
involve
some
injustice
to
scotland
and
an
equivalent
was
allowed
to
compensate
for
the
responsibility
now
accruing
to
scotland
in
connection
with
the
english
national
debt
it
remained
to
adjust
the
representation
of
scotland
in
the
united
parliament
it
was
at
first
proposed
to
allow
only
members
but
the
number
was
finally
raised
to
thirty
of
these
represented
the
shires
each
shire
was
to
elect
one
representative
except
the
three
groups
of
bute
and
caithness
clackmannan
and
kinross
and
nairn
and
cromarty
in
each
group
the
election
was
made
alternately
by
the
two
counties
thus
bute
clackmannan
and
nairn
each
sent
a
member
in
and
caithness
kinross
and
cromarty
in
the
device
is
sufficiently
unusual
to
deserve
mention
the
burghs
were
divided
into
fifteen
groups
each
of
which
was
given
one
member
in
this
form
after
considerable
difficulty
the
act
was
carried
both
in
scotland
and
in
england
it
was
a
union
much
less
extensive
than
that
which
had
been
planned
by
james
vi
or
that
which
had
been
in
actual
force
under
cromwell
the
existence
of
a
separate
church
governed
differently
from
the
english
establishment
and
the
maintenance
of
a
separate
legal
code
and
a
separate
judicature
have
helped
to
preserve
some
of
the
national
characteristics
of
the
scots
not
for
many
years
did
the
union
become
popular
in
scotland
and
not
for
many
years
did
the
two
nations
become
really
united
it
might
in
fact
be
said
that
the
force
of
steam
has
accomplished
what
law
has
failed
to
do
and
that
the
real
incorporation
of
scotland

england

this
contrast

and

must
be
read
in
the
light
of
fordun
general
view
of
the
work
of
the
descendants
of
malcolm
canmore
he
describes
how
david
i
changed
the
lowlanders
into
civilized
men
but
never
hints
that
he
did
so
by
introducing
englishmen
he
represents
the
whole
nation
outside
the
old
northumbrian
kingdom
as
picts
and
scots
on
whose
antiquity
he
lays
stress
and
merely
mentions
that
malcolm
canmore
welcomed
english
refugees
the
following
extracts
show
that
he
looked
upon
the
lowlanders
not
as
a
separate
race
from
the
highlanders
but
simply
as
men
of
the
same
barbarian
race
who
had
been
civilized

david

appendix
b
the
feudalization
of
scotland
the
object
of
this
appendix
is
to
give
a
summary
of
the
process
by
which
feudalism
came
to
supersede
the
earlier
scottish
civilization
for
a
more
detailed
account
the
reader
is
referred
to
skene
robertson
under
her
early
and
lang
of
the
kingdom
of
which
malcolm
canmore
became
the
ruler
in
was
not
inhabited
by
clans
it
had
been
from
of
old
divided
into
seven
provinces
each
of
which
was
inhabited
by
tribes
the
tribe
or
tuath
was
governed
by
its
own
chief
or
king
ri
or
toisech
each
province
or
mor
tuath
was
governed
by
ri
mor
tuath
or
mormaer
and
these
seven
mormaers
seem
in
theory
at
all
events
to
have
elected
the
national
king
and
to
have
acted
as
his
advisers
the
tribe
was
divided
into
freemen
and
slaves
and
freemen
and
slaves
alike
were
subdivided
into
various
classes
noble
and
simple
serfs
attached
to
land
and
personal
bondmen
the
land
was
held
not
by
the
tribe
in
general
but
by
the
or
near
kin
of
the
or
senior
of
each
family
within
the
tribe
on
the
death
of
a
senior
the
new
senior
was
chosen
generally
with
strict
regard
to
primogeniture
from
among
the
nearest
in
blood
and
all
who
were
within
three
degrees
of
kin
to
him
shared
in
the
of
the
proceeds
of
the
land
the
senior
had
special
privileges
and
was
the
representative
and
surety
of
the
and
the
guardian
of
their
common
interests
after
the
third
generation
a
man
ceased
to
be
reckoned
among
the
and
probably
received
a
small
personal
allotment
most
of
his
descendants
would
thus
be
landless
or
if
they
held
land
would
do
so
by
what
soon
amounted
to
servile
tenure
thus
the
majority
of
the
tribe
had
little
or
nothing
to
lose
by
the
feudalization
that
was
approaching
the
changes
of
malcolm
reign
are
concerned
with
the
church
not
with
but
the
territorialization
of
the
church
and
the
abolition
of
the
ecclesiastical
system
of
the
tribe
foreshadowed
the
innovations
that
malcolm
son
was
to
introduce
we
have
seen
that
an
reaction
followed
the
deaths
of
malcolm
and
margaret
this
is
important
because
it
involved
an
expulsion
of
the
english
from
scotland
which
may
be
compared
with
the
expulsion
of
the
normans
from
england
after
the
return
of
godwin
our
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
is
derived
from
the
following

it
was
not
till
the
reign
of
alexander
i
that
the
new
influences
made
any
serious
modification
of
ancient
custom
the
peaceful
edgar
had
surrounded
himself
with
english
favourites
and
had
granted
saxon
charters
to
saxon
landholders
in
the
lothians
his
brother
alexander
made
the
first
efforts
to
abolish
the
old
celtic
tenure
in
he
gave
a
charter
to
the
monastery
of
scone
and
not
only
did
the
charter
contemplate
the
direct
holding
of
land
from
the
king
but
the
signatories
or
witnesses
described
themselves
as
earls
not
as
mormaers
the
monastery
was
founded
to
commemorate
the
suppression
of
a
revolt
of
the
celts
of
moray
and
the
earls
who
witnessed
the
charter
bore
celtic
names
this
policy
of
taking
advantage
of
rebellions
to
introduce
english
civilization
became
a
characteristic
method
of
the
kings
of
scotland
alexander
successor
david
i
set
himself
definitely
to
carry
on
the
work
which
his
brother
had
begun
he
found
his
opportunity
in
the
rising
of
malcolm
macheth
earl
of
moray
to
this
rising
we
have
already
referred
in
the
introduction
it
was
the
greatest
effort
made
against
the
innovations
of
the
sons
of
malcolm
canmore
and
its
leader
malcolm
macheth
was
the
representative
of
a
rival
line
of
kings
david
had
to
obtain
the
assistance
not
only
of
the
by
whom
he
himself
was
surrounded
but
also
of
some
of
the
barons
of
northumberland
and
yorkshire
with
whom
he
had
a
connection
as
earl
of
huntingdon
for
the
descendant
of
the
celtic
kings
of
scotland
was
himself
an
english
baron
we
have
seen
that
david
captured
macheth
and
forfeited
the
lands
of
moray
which
he
regranted
on
feudal
terms
to
or
to
native
scots
who
supported
the
king
new
policy
the
war
with
england
interrupted
david
work
as
a
long
struggle
with
the
church
had
prevented
his
brother
alexander
from
giving
full
scope
to
the
principles
that
both
had
learned
in
the
english
court
but
by
the
end
of
david
reign
the
lines
of
future
development
had
been
quite
clearly
laid
down
the
celtic
church
had
almost
disappeared
the
bishops
of
andrews
dunkeld
moray
glasgow
ross
caithness
aberdeen
dunblane
brechin
and
galloway
were
great
royal
officers
who
inculcated
upon
the
people
the
necessity
of
adopting
the
new
political
and
ecclesiastical
system
the
culdee
monasteries
were
dying
out
north
of
the
forth
scone
had
been
founded
by
alexander
i
as
a
pioneer
of
the
new
civilization
and
after
the
defeat
of
malcolm
macheth
and
the
settlement
of
moray
david
in
founded
the
abbey
of
kinloss
the
celtic
official
terms
were
replaced
by
english
names
the
mormaer
had
become
the
earl
the
toisech
was
now
the
thane
and
earl
and
thane
alike
were
losing
their
position
as
the
royal
representative
as
david
gradually
introduced
the
or
sheriff
who
represented
the
royal
exchequer
and
the
royal
system
of
justice
police
regulations
tended
still
further
to
strengthen
the
nascent
feudalism
like
the
kings
of
england
he
would
have
none
of
the
lordless
man
of
whom
no
law
can
be
got
and
commendation
was
added
to
the
forces
which
produced
the
disintegration
of
the
tribal
system
not
less
important
was
the
introduction
of
written
charters
alexander
had
given
a
written
charter
to
the
monastery
of
scone
david
gave
private
charters
to
individual
and
made
the
possession
of
a
charter
the
test
of
a
freeholder
finally
it
is
from
david
reign
that
scottish
burghs
take
their
origin
he
encouraged
the
rise
of
towns
as
part
of
the
feudal
system
the
burgesses
were
of
the
king
held
of
him
by
charter
and
stood
in
the
same
relation
to
him
as
other
so
firmly
grounded
was
this
idea
that
up
to
the
only
scottish
burgesses
who
attended
parliament
were
representatives
of
the
ancient
royal
burghs
and
their
right
depended
historically
not
on
any
gift
of
the
franchise
but
on
their
position
as
that
there
were
strangers
among
the
new
burgesses
can
not
be
doubted
saxons
and
normans
mingled
with
danes
and
flemish
merchants
in
the
humble
streets
of
the
villages
that
were
protected
by
the
royal
castle
and
that
grew
into
scottish
towns
but
their
numbers
were
too
few
to
give
us
any
ground
for
believing
that
they
were
in
any
sense
foreign
colonies
or
that
they
seriously
modified
the
ethnic
character
of
the
land
men
from
the
country
would
for
reasons
of
protection
or
from
the
impulse
of
commerce
find
their
way
into
the
towns
it
is
certain
that
the
population
of
the
towns
did
not
migrate
into
the
country
the
real
importance
of
the
towns
lies
in
the
part
they
played
in
the
spread
of
the
english
tongue
to
the
influence
of
court
and
king
of
land
tenure
of
law
and
police
of
parish
priest
and
monk
and
abbot
and
bishop
was
added
the
persuasive
force
of
commercial
interest
the
death
of
david
i
in
was
immediately
followed
by
celtic
revolts
against
order
the
province
of
moray
made
a
final
effort
on
behalf
of
donald
mac
malcolm
macheth
the
son
of
the
malcolm
macheth
of
the
previous
reign
and
of
a
sister
of
somerled
of
argyll
the
ancestor
of
the
lord
of
the
isles
the
new
king
malcolm
iv
the
grandson
of
david
easily
subdued
this
rising
and
it
is
in
connection
with
its
suppression
that
fordun
makes
the
statement
quoted
in
the
introduction
about
the
displacement
of
the
population
of
moray
there
is
no
earlier
authority
for
it
than
the
fourteenth
century
and
the
inherent
probability
in
its
favour
is
so
very
slight
that
but
little
weight
can
reasonably
be
assigned
to
it
david
had
already
granted
moray
to
who
were
now
in
possession
of
the
lowland
portion
and
who
ruled
the
celtic
population
we
should
expect
to
hear
something
definite
of
any
further
change
in
the
lowlands
and
a
repopulation
of
the
highlands
of
moray
was
beyond
the
limits
of
possibility
the
king
too
had
little
time
to
carry
out
such
a
measure
for
he
had
immediately
to
face
a
new
rebellion
in
galloway
he
reigned
for
twelve
years
in
all
and
was
only
years
of
age
when
he
died
the
only
truth
in
fordun
statement
is
probably
that
malcolm
iv
carried
on
the
policy
of
david
i
in
regard
to
the
of
moray
and
forfeited
the
possessions
of
those
who
had
taken
part
in
macheth
rising
in
galloway
a
similar
policy
was
pursued
some
of
the
old
nobility
offended
perhaps
by
malcolm
attendance
on
henry
ii
at
toulouse
in
his
capacity
as
an
english
baron
joined
the
defeated
donald
macheth
in
an
attempt
upon
malcolm
at
perth
in
macheth
took
refuge
in
galloway
which
the
king
had
to
invade
three
times
before
bringing
it
into
subjection
before
his
death
in
galloway
was
part
of
the
feudal
kingdom
of
scotland
only
once
again
was
the
security
of
the
dynasty
seriously
threatened
by
the
supporters
of
the
older
civilization
when
william
the
lion
brother
and
successor
of
malcolm
iv
was
the
prisoner
of
henry
ii
risings
took
place
both
in
galloway
and
in
moray
a
galloway
chieftain
by
name
gilbert
maintained
an
independent
rule
to
his
death
in
when
william
came
to
terms
with
his
nephew
and
successor
roland
in
the
north
donald
bane
mac
william
a
of
malcolm
canmore
raised
the
standard
of
revolt
in
and
it
was
not
till
that
the
rebellion
was
finally
suppressed
and
donald
bane
killed
there
were
further
risings
in
moray
in
on
the
accession
of
alexander
ii
and
in
galloway
in
the
chronicler
walter
of
coventry
tells
us
that
these
revolts
were
occasioned
by
the
fact
that
recent
scottish
kings
had
proved
themselves
frenchmen
rather
than
scots
and
had
surrounded
themselves
solely
with
frenchmen
this
is
the
real
explanation
of
the
support
given
to
the
celtic
pretenders
a
new
civilization
is
not
easily
imposed
upon
a
people
elsewhere
in
scotland
the
process
was
more
gradual
and
less
violent
in
the
eastern
lowlands
there
were
no
pretenders
and
no
rebellions
and
traces
of
the
earlier
civilization
remained
longer
than
in
galloway
and
in
moray
in
fife
alone
says
robertson
the
earl
continued
in
the
thirteenth
century
to
exercise
the
prerogatives
of
a
royal
maor
and
in
the
reign
of
david
i
we
find
in
fife
what
is
practically
the
clan
macduff
neither
in
the
eastern
lowlands
nor
in
the
more
disturbed
districts
of
moray
and
galloway
is
there
any
evidence
of
a
radical
change
in
the
population
the
changes
were
imposed
from
above
lang
has
pointed
out
that
we
do
not
hear
of
feuds
consequent
on
the
eviction
of
prior
holders
the
juries
from
angus
to
clyde
are
full
of
celtic
names
of
the
gentry
the
steward
fitzalan
got
renfrew
but
the
or
gentry
remain
celtic
after
the
reigns
of
david
and
william
the
contemporary
chronicler
aelred
gives
no
hint
that
david
replaced
his
scottish
subjects
by
an
population
he
admits
that
he
was
terrible
to
the
men
of
galloway
but
insists
that
he
was
beloved
of
the
scots
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
new
system
brought
justice
and
order
with
it
and
must
soon
have
commended
itself
by
its
practical
results
the
grants
of
land
did
not
mean
dispossession
the
small
owners
of
land
and
the
serfs
acquiesced
in
the
new
rule
and
began
to
take
new
names
and
the
strangers
were
in
actual
possession
not
of
the
land
itself
but
of
the
owed
by
the
land
even
with
regard
to
the
great
lords
the
statements
have
been
slightly
exaggerated
alexander
ii
was
aided
in
crushing
the
rebellion
of
by
celtic
earls
and
in
he
subdued
galloway
by
the
aid
of
a
celtic
earl
of
ross
we
have
attempted
to
explain
the
anglicization
of
scotland
south
and
east
of
the
highland
line
by
the
combined
forces
of
the
church
the
court
feudalism
and
commerce
and
it
is
unnecessary
to
lay
further
stress
upon
the
importance
of
these
elements
in
twelfth
century
life
it
may
be
interesting
to
compare
with
this
the
process
by
which
the
scottish
highlands
have
been
anglicized
within
the
last
century
and
a
half
it
must
in
the
first
place
be
fully
understood
that
the
interval
between
the
twelfth
century
and
the
suppression
of
the
last
jacobite
rising
was
not
void
of
development
even
in
the
highlands
it
is
in
the
reign
of
david
the
first
says
skene
that
the
sept
or
clan
first
appears
as
a
distinct
and
prominent
feature
in
the
social
organization
of
the
gaelic
population
and
it
is
not
till
the
reign
of
robert
iii
that
he
finds
the
first
appearance
of
a
distinct
clan
between
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
century
and
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
the
clan
had
developed
a
complete
organization
consisting
of
the
chief
and
his
kinsmen
the
common
people
of
the
same
blood
and
the
dependants
of
the
clan
each
clan
contained
several
septs
founded
by
such
descendants
of
chiefs
as
had
obtained
a
definite
possession
in
land
the
writer
of
from
a
gentleman
in
the
north
of
scotland
in
mentions
that
the
highland
clans
were
subdivided
into
smaller
branches
of
fifty
or
sixty
men
who
deduce
their
original
from
their
particular
chieftains
and
rely
upon
them
as
their
more
immediate
protectors
and
defenders
the
hanoverian
government
had
thus
to
face
in
a
problem
in
some
respects
more
difficult
than
that
which
the
descendants
of
malcolm
canmore
had
solved
the
clan
organization
was
complete
and
clan
loyalty
had
assumed
the
form
of
an
extravagant
devotion
a
hostile
feeling
had
arisen
between
highlands
and
lowlands
and
all
feeling
of
common
nationality
had
been
lost
there
was
no
such
important
factor
as
the
church
to
help
the
change
religion
was
on
the
whole
perhaps
rather
adverse
than
favourable
to
the
process
of
anglicization
on
the
other
hand
the
task
was
in
other
aspects
very
much
easier
the
highlands
had
been
affected
by
the
events
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
the
chiefs
were
no
longer
mere
freebooters
and
raiders
the
jacobite
rising
had
weakened
the
highlands
and
the
clans
had
been
divided
among
themselves
it
was
not
a
united
opposition
that
confronted
the
government
above
all
the
methods
of
had
already
been
rendered
subject
to
very
considerable
modification
since
the
reign
of
james
vi
the
law
had
been
successful
in
attempting
to
ignore
all
celtic
usages
inconsistent
with
its
principles
and
it
regarded
all
persons
possessing
a
feudal
title
as
absolute
proprietors
of
the
land
and
all
occupants
of
the
land
who
could
not
show
a
right
derived
from
the
proprietor
as
simple
tenants
thus
the
strongest
support
of
the
clan
system
had
been
removed
before
the
suppression
of
the
clans
the
government
of
george
ii
placed
the
highlands
under
military
occupation
and
began
to
root
out
every
tendency
towards
the
persistence
of
a
clan
organization
the
clan
as
a
military
unit
ceased
to
exist
when
the
highlanders
were
disarmed
and
as
a
unit
for
administrative
purposes
when
the
heritable
jurisdictions
were
abolished
and
it
could
no
longer
claim
to
be
a
political
force
of
any
kind
for
every
vestige
of
independence
was
removed
the
only
individual
characteristic
left
to
the
clan
or
to
the
highlander
was
the
tartan
and
the
celtic
garb
and
its
use
was
prohibited
under
very
severe
penalties
these
were
measures
which
were
not
possible
in
the
days
of
david
as
they
were
in
those
of
george
but
a
further
step
was
common
to
both
centuries
the
forfeiture
of
lands
and
although
a
later
government
restored
many
of
these
to
descendants
of
the
attainted
chiefs
the
magic
spell
had
been
broken
and
the
proprietor
was
no
longer
the
head
of
the
clan
such
measures
and
the
introduction
of
had
within
sixty
years
changed
the
whole
face
of
the
highlands
another
century
has
been
added
to
sir
walter
years
and
it
may
be
argued
that
all
the
resources
of
modern
civilisation
have
failed
to
accomplish
in
that
period
what
the
descendants
of
malcolm
canmore
effected
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
this
is
true
as
far
as
language
is
concerned
but
only
with
regard
to
language
the
highlanders
have
not
forgotten
the
gaelic
tongue
as
the
lowlanders
had
forgotten
it
by
the
outbreak
of
the
war
of
independence
various
facts
account
for
this
one
of
the
features
of
recent
days
is
an
antiquarian
revival
which
has
tended
to
preserve
for
highland
children
the
great
intellectual
advantage
of
a
education
the
very
severance
of
the
bond
between
chieftain
and
clan
has
helped
to
perpetuate
the
ancient
language
for
the
people
no
longer
adopt
the
speech
of
their
chief
as
in
earlier
days
the
celt
of
moray
or
of
fife
adopted
the
tongue
spoken
by
his
lord
or
learned
by
the
great
men
of
his
own
race
at
the
court
of
david
or
of
william
the
lion
the
bible
has
been
translated
into
gaelic
and
gaelic
has
become
the
language
of
highland
religion
in
the
lowlands
of
the
twelfth
century
the
whole
influence
of
the
church
was
directed
to
the
extermination
of
the
culdee
religion
associated
with
the
celtic
language
and
with
celtic
civilization
above
all
the
difference
lies
in
the
rise
of
burghs
in
the
lowlands
speech
follows
trade
every
small
town
on
the
east
coast
was
a
school
of
english
language
should
commerce
ever
reach
the
highlands
should
the
abomination
of
desolation
overtake
the
waterfalls
and
the
valleys
and
other
temples
of
nature
share
the
degradation
of
the
falls
of
foyers
we
may
then
look
for
the
disappearance
of
the
gaelic
tongue
be
all
this
as
it
may
it
is
undeniable
that
there
has
been
in
the
highlands
since
a
change
of
civilization
without
a
displacement
of
race
we
venture
to
think
that
there
is
some
ground
for
the
view
that
a
similar
change
of
civilization
occurred
in
the
lowlands
between
and
and
similarly
without
a
racial
dispossession
we
do
not
deny
that
there
was
some
infusion
of
blood
between
the
forth
and
the
moray
firth
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
was
a
repopulation
