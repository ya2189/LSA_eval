including
a
narrative
of

we
hold
these

to
be
that
all

equal

with
certain
unalienable

among
these
are

the

its

of
its
consequences
to
himself
by
the
principal

not

proper
to
state
that
a
large

secured

incapacitates

memoir
i
was
born
in
the
year
in
cumberland
county
downs
township
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
on
the
shores
of
nantuxet
creek
not
far
from
delaware
bay
into
which
that
creek
flows
my
father
was
a
farmer
not
a
very
profitable
occupation
in
that
barren
part
of
the
country
my
mother
was
a
widow
at
the
time
of
her
marriage
with
my
father
having
three
children
by
a
former
husband
by
my
father
she
had
six
more
of
whom
i
was
the
youngest
but
one
she
was
a
woman
of
strong
mind
and
marked
character
a
zealous
member
of
the
methodist
church
and
although
i
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
her
at
an
early
age
her
instructions
though
the
effect
was
not
apparent
at
the
moment
made
a
deep
impression
on
my
youthful
mind
and
no
doubt
had
a
very
sensible
influence
over
my
future
life
just
previous
to
or
during
the
war
with
great
britain
my
father
removed
still
nearer
to
the
shore
of
the
bay
and
the
sight
of
the
vessels
passing
up
and
down
inspired
me
with
a
desire
to
follow
the
life
of
a
waterman
but
it
was
some
years
before
i
was
able
to
gratify
this
wish
i
well
remember
the
alarm
created
in
our
neighborhood
by
the
incursions
of
the
british
vessels
up
the
bay
during
the
war
and
that
at
these
times
the
women
of
the
neighborhood
used
to
collect
at
our
house
as
if
looking
up
to
my
mother
for
counsel
and
guidance
i
was
only
twelve
years
old
when
this
good
mother
died
but
so
strong
was
the
impression
which
she
left
upon
my
memory
that
amid
the
struggles
and
dangers
and
cares
of
my
subsequent
life
i
have
seldom
closed
my
eyes
to
sleep
without
some
thought
or
image
of
her
as
my
father
soon
after
married
another
widow
with
four
small
children
it
became
necessary
to
make
room
in
the
house
for
their
accommodation
and
with
a
younger
brother
of
mine
i
was
bound
out
an
apprentice
in
a
cotton
and
woollen
factory
at
a
place
called
cedarville
manufactures
were
just
then
beginning
to
be
introduced
into
the
country
and
great
hopes
were
entertained
of
them
as
a
profitable
business
my
employer
or
bos
as
we
called
him
had
formerly
been
a
schoolmaster
and
he
did
not
wholly
neglect
our
instructions
in
other
things
besides
of
this
i
stood
greatly
in
need
for
there
were
no
public
schools
in
the
neighborhood
in
which
i
was
born
and
my
parents
had
too
many
children
to
feed
and
clothe
to
be
able
to
pay
much
for
schooling
we
were
required
on
sundays
by
our
employer
to
learn
two
lessons
one
in
the
forenoon
the
other
in
the
afternoon
after
reciting
which
we
were
left
at
liberty
to
roam
at
our
pleasure
winter
evenings
we
worked
in
the
factory
till
nine
after
which
and
before
going
to
bed
we
were
required
to
recite
over
one
of
our
lessons
these
advantages
of
education
were
not
great
but
even
these
i
soon
lost
within
five
months
from
the
time
i
was
bound
to
him
my
employer
died
the
factories
were
then
sold
out
to
three
partners
the
one
who
carried
on
the
took
me
but
he
soon
gave
up
the
business
and
went
back
to
farming
which
had
been
his
original
occupation
i
remained
with
him
for
a
year
and
a
half
or
thereabouts
when
my
father
bound
me
out
apprentice
to
a
my
new
bos
was
in
some
respects
a
remarkable
man
but
not
a
very
good
sort
of
one
for
a
boy
to
be
bound
apprentice
to
he
paid
very
little
attention
to
his
business
which
he
seemed
to
think
unworthy
of
his
genius
he
was
a
man
fond
of
company
and
frolics
in
which
he
indulged
himself
freely
and
much
given
to
speeches
and
harangues
in
which
he
had
a
good
deal
of
fluency
in
religion
he
professed
to
be
a
universalist
holding
to
doctrines
and
opinions
very
different
from
those
which
my
mother
had
instilled
into
me
he
ridiculed
those
opinions
and
argued
against
them
but
without
converting
me
to
his
way
of
thinking
though
as
far
as
practice
went
i
was
ready
enough
to
imitate
his
example
my
sundays
were
spent
principally
in
taverns
playing
at
dominos
which
then
was
and
still
is
a
favorite
game
in
that
part
of
the
country
and
as
the
unsuccessful
party
was
expected
to
treat
i
at
times
ran
up
a
bill
at
the
bar
as
high
as
four
or
six
dollars
no
small
indebtedness
for
a
young
apprentice
with
no
more
means
than
i
had
as
i
grew
older
this
method
of
living
grew
less
and
less
satisfactory
to
me
and
as
i
saw
that
no
good
of
any
kind
not
even
a
knowledge
of
the
trade
he
had
undertaken
to
teach
me
was
to
be
got
of
my
present
bos
i
bought
my
time
of
him
and
went
to
work
with
another
man
to
pay
for
it
before
i
had
succeeded
in
doing
that
and
while
i
was
not
yet
nineteen
i
took
upon
myself
the
still
further
responsibility
of
marriage
this
was
a
step
into
which
i
was
led
rather
by
the
impulse
of
youthful
passion
than
by
any
thoughtful
foresight
yet
it
had
at
least
this
advantage
that
it
obliged
me
to
set
diligently
to
work
to
provide
for
the
increasing
family
which
i
soon
found
growing
up
around
me
i
had
never
liked
the
business
to
which
my
father
had
bound
me
an
apprentice
i
had
always
desired
to
follow
the
water
the
vessels
which
i
had
seen
sailing
up
and
down
the
delaware
bay
still
haunted
my
fancy
and
i
engaged
myself
as
cook
on
board
a
sloop
employed
in
carrying
wood
from
maurice
river
to
philadelphia
promotion
in
this
line
is
sufficiently
rapid
for
in
four
months
after
commencing
as
cook
i
rose
to
be
captain
this
wood
business
in
which
i
remained
for
two
years
is
carried
on
by
vessels
of
from
thirty
to
sixty
tons
known
as
they
are
built
so
as
to
draw
but
little
water
which
is
their
chief
distinction
from
the
which
are
fit
for
the
open
sea
they
will
carry
from
to
fifty
cords
of
wood
on
which
a
profit
is
expected
of
a
dollar
and
upwards
they
have
usually
about
three
hands
the
captain
or
skipper
included
the
men
used
to
be
hired
when
i
entered
the
business
for
eight
or
ten
dollars
the
month
but
they
now
get
nearly
or
quite
twice
as
much
the
captain
usually
sails
the
vessel
on
shares
unless
he
is
himself
owner
in
whole
or
in
part
victualling
the
vessel
and
hiring
the
men
and
paying
over
to
the
owner
forty
dollars
out
of
every
hundred
during
the
winter
from
december
to
march
the
navigation
is
impeded
by
ice
and
the
seldom
run
the
men
commonly
spend
this
long
vacation
in
visiting
rabbiting
and
too
often
in
taverns
to
the
exhaustion
of
their
purses
the
impoverishment
of
their
families
and
the
sacrifice
of
their
sobriety
yet
the
watermen
if
many
of
them
are
not
able
always
to
resist
the
temptations
held
out
to
them
are
in
general
an
honest
and
set
though
with
little
education
and
sometimes
rather
rough
in
their
manners
the
extent
of
my
education
when
i
took
to
the
water
and
in
this
respect
i
was
not
perhaps
much
inferior
to
the
generality
of
my
brother
watermen
was
to
read
with
no
great
fluency
and
to
sign
my
name
nor
did
i
ever
learn
much
more
than
this
till
my
residence
in
washington
jail
to
be
related
hereafter
having
followed
the
wood
business
for
two
years
i
aspired
to
something
a
little
higher
and
obtained
the
command
of
a
sloop
engaged
in
the
coasting
business
from
philadelphia
southward
and
eastward
at
this
time
a
sloop
of
sixty
tons
was
considered
a
very
respectable
coaster
the
business
is
now
mostly
carried
on
by
vessels
of
a
larger
class
some
of
them
especially
the
regular
lines
of
packets
being
very
handsome
and
expensive
the
terms
on
which
these
coasters
were
sailed
were
very
similar
to
those
already
stated
in
the
case
of
the
the
captain
victualled
the
vessel
and
paid
the
hands
and
received
for
his
share
half
the
net
profits
after
deducting
the
extra
expenses
of
loading
and
unloading
it
was
in
this
coasting
business
that
the
best
years
of
my
life
were
spent
during
which
time
i
visited
most
of
the
ports
and
rivers
between
savannah
southward
and
john
in
the
british
province
of
new
brunswick
eastward
those
two
places
forming
the
extreme
limits
of
my
voyagings
as
philadelphia
was
the
port
from
and
to
which
i
sailed
i
presently
found
it
convenient
to
remove
my
family
thither
and
there
they
continued
to
live
till
after
my
release
from
the
washington
prison
i
was
so
successful
in
my
new
business
that
besides
supporting
my
family
i
was
able
to
become
half
owner
of
the
sloop
superior
at
an
expense
of
over
a
thousand
dollars
most
of
which
i
paid
down
but
this
proved
a
very
unfortunate
investment
on
her
second
trip
after
i
had
bought
into
her
returning
from
baltimore
to
philadelphia
by
the
way
of
the
delaware
and
chesapeake
canal
while
off
the
mouth
of
the
susquehannah
she
struck
as
i
suppose
a
sunken
tree
brought
down
by
a
heavy
freshet
in
that
river
the
water
flowed
fast
into
the
cabin
it
was
in
vain
that
i
attempted
to
run
her
ashore
she
sunk
in
five
minutes
the
men
saved
themselves
in
the
boat
which
was
on
deck
and
which
floated
as
she
went
down
i
stood
by
the
rudder
till
the
last
and
stepped
off
it
into
the
boat
loath
enough
to
leave
my
vessel
on
which
there
was
no
insurance
by
this
unfortunate
accident
i
lost
everything
except
the
clothes
i
had
on
and
was
obliged
to
commence
anew
i
accordingly
obtained
the
command
of
the
new
sloop
sarah
henry
of
seventy
tons
burden
and
continued
to
sail
her
for
several
years
on
shares
while
in
her
i
made
a
voyage
to
savannah
and
while
under
sail
from
that
city
for
charleston
i
was
taken
with
the
yellow
fever
i
lay
for
a
week
quite
unconscious
of
anything
that
was
going
on
about
me
and
came
as
near
dying
as
a
man
could
do
and
escape
the
religious
instructions
of
my
mother
had
from
time
to
time
recurred
to
my
mind
and
had
occasioned
me
some
anxiety
i
was
now
greatly
alarmed
at
the
idea
of
dying
in
my
sins
from
which
i
seemed
to
have
escaped
so
narrowly
my
mind
was
possessed
with
this
fear
and
to
relieve
myself
from
it
i
determined
if
it
were
a
possible
thing
to
get
religion
at
any
rate
the
idea
of
religion
in
which
i
had
been
educated
was
that
of
a
sudden
miraculous
change
in
which
a
man
felt
himself
relieved
from
the
burden
of
his
sins
united
to
god
and
made
a
new
creature
for
this
experience
i
diligently
sought
and
tried
every
way
to
get
it
i
set
up
family
prayers
in
my
house
went
to
meetings
and
conversed
with
experienced
members
of
the
church
but
for
nine
months
or
more
all
to
no
purpose
at
length
i
got
into
an
awful
state
beginning
to
think
that
i
had
been
so
desperate
a
sinner
that
there
was
no
forgiveness
for
me
while
i
was
in
this
miserable
condition
i
heard
of
a
about
to
be
held
on
cape
may
and
i
immediately
resolved
to
attend
it
and
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
accomplish
the
object
which
i
had
so
much
at
heart
i
went
accordingly
and
yielded
myself
entirely
up
to
the
dictation
of
those
who
had
the
control
of
the
meeting
i
did
in
everything
as
i
was
told
went
into
the
altar
prayed
and
let
them
pray
over
me
this
went
on
for
several
days
without
any
result
one
evening
as
i
approached
the
altar
and
was
looking
into
it
i
met
a
captain
of
my
acquaintance
and
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
these
proceedings
and
as
he
seemed
to
approve
them
i
invited
him
to
go
into
the
altar
with
me
we
both
went
in
accordingly
and
knelt
down
pretty
soon
my
friend
got
up
and
walked
away
saying
he
had
got
religion
i
did
not
find
it
so
easily
i
remained
at
the
altar
praying
till
after
the
meeting
broke
up
and
even
till
one
a
few
acquaintances
and
others
remaining
with
me
and
praying
round
me
and
over
me
and
for
me
till
at
last
thinking
that
i
had
done
everything
i
could
i
told
them
pray
no
more
as
evidently
there
was
no
forgiveness
for
me
so
i
withdrew
to
a
distance
and
sat
down
upon
an
old
tree
lamenting
my
hard
case
very
seriously
i
was
sure
i
had
committed
the
unpardonable
sin
a
friend
who
sat
down
beside
me
and
of
whom
i
inquired
what
he
supposed
the
unpardonable
sin
was
endeavored
comfort
me
by
suggesting
that
whatever
it
might
be
it
would
take
more
sense
and
learning
than
ever
i
had
to
commit
it
but
i
would
not
enter
into
his
merriment
all
the
next
day
which
was
sunday
i
passed
in
a
most
miserable
state
i
went
into
the
woods
alone
i
did
not
think
myself
worthy
or
fit
to
associate
with
those
who
had
religion
while
i
was
anxious
to
avoid
the
company
of
those
who
made
light
of
it
sometimes
i
would
sit
down
sometimes
i
would
stand
up
sometimes
i
would
walk
about
frequently
i
prayed
but
found
no
comfort
in
it
about
i
met
a
friend
who
said
to
me
well
our
is
about
ended
what
a
misery
those
few
words
struck
to
my
heart
about
ended
i
said
to
myself
about
ended
and
i
not
converted
a
little
later
as
i
was
passing
along
the
i
saw
a
woman
before
me
kneeling
and
praying
an
acquaintance
of
mine
who
was
approaching
her
in
an
opposite
direction
called
out
to
me
daniel
help
me
pray
for
this
woman
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
make
one
more
effort
and
i
knelt
down
and
commenced
praying
but
quite
as
much
for
myself
as
for
her
others
gathered
about
us
and
joined
in
and
the
interest
and
excitement
became
so
great
that
after
a
vain
effort
to
call
us
off
the
regular
services
of
the
evening
were
dispensed
with
and
the
ground
was
left
to
us
things
went
on
in
this
way
till
about
nine
when
as
suddenly
as
if
i
had
been
struck
a
heavy
blow
i
felt
a
remarkable
change
come
over
me
all
my
fears
and
terrors
seemed
to
be
instantaneously
removed
and
my
whole
soul
to
be
filled
with
joy
and
peace
this
was
the
sort
of
change
which
i
had
been
taught
to
look
for
as
the
consequence
of
getting
that
religion
for
which
i
had
been
struggling
so
hard
i
instantly
rose
up
and
told
those
about
me
that
i
was
a
converted
man
and
from
that
moment
i
was
able
to
sing
and
shout
and
pray
with
the
best
of
them
in
the
midst
of
my
exultation
who
should
come
up
but
my
old
master
in
the
trade
of
whom
i
have
already
given
some
account
he
had
heard
that
i
was
on
the
in
pursuit
of
religion
and
had
come
to
find
me
out
daniel
he
said
addressing
me
by
my
christian
name
what
are
you
doing
here
do
make
a
fool
of
yourself
to
which
i
answered
that
i
had
got
to
be
just
such
a
fool
as
i
had
long
wanted
to
be
and
i
took
him
by
the
arm
and
endeavored
to
prevail
upon
him
to
kneel
down
and
allow
us
to
pray
over
him
assuring
him
that
i
knew
his
convictions
to
be
much
better
than
his
conduct
that
he
must
get
religion
and
now
was
the
time
but
he
drew
back
and
escaped
from
me
with
promises
to
do
better
which
however
he
did
not
keep
as
for
myself
considering
and
as
i
thought
feeling
that
i
was
a
converted
man
i
now
enjoyed
for
some
time
an
extraordinary
satisfaction
a
sort
of
offset
to
the
months
of
agony
and
misery
which
i
had
previously
endured
but
though
regarding
myself
as
now
truly
converted
i
delayed
some
time
before
uniting
myself
with
any
particular
church
i
did
not
know
which
to
join
this
division
into
so
many
hostile
sects
seemed
to
me
unaccountable
i
thought
that
all
good
christians
should
love
each
other
and
be
as
one
family
yet
it
seemed
necessary
to
unite
myself
with
some
body
of
christians
and
as
i
had
been
educated
a
methodist
i
concluded
to
join
them
i
have
given
the
account
of
my
religious
experience
exactly
as
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
and
as
i
now
remember
it
it
corresponded
with
the
common
course
of
religious
experiences
in
the
methodist
church
except
that
with
me
the
struggle
was
harder
than
commonly
happens
i
did
not
doubt
at
the
time
that
it
was
truly
a
supernatural
change
as
much
the
work
of
the
spirit
as
the
sudden
conversions
recorded
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
others
can
form
their
own
opinion
about
it
i
will
only
add
that
subsequent
experience
has
led
me
to
the
belief
that
the
reality
of
a
man
religion
is
more
to
be
judged
of
by
what
he
does
than
by
how
he
feels
or
what
he
says
the
change
which
had
taken
place
in
me
however
it
is
to
be
regarded
was
not
without
a
decided
influence
on
my
whole
future
life
i
no
longer
considered
myself
as
living
for
myself
alone
i
regarded
myself
as
bound
to
do
unto
others
as
i
would
that
they
should
do
unto
me
and
it
was
in
attempting
to
act
up
to
this
principle
that
i
became
involved
in
the
difficulties
to
be
hereafter
related
meanwhile
i
resumed
my
voyages
in
the
sarah
henry
in
which
i
continued
to
sail
on
shares
for
several
years
with
tolerable
success
afterwards
i
followed
the
same
business
in
the
schooner
protection
in
which
i
suffered
another
shipwreck
we
sailed
from
philadelphia
to
washington
in
the
district
of
columbia
laden
with
coal
proceeding
down
the
delaware
and
by
the
open
sea
but
when
off
the
entrance
of
the
chesapeake
we
encountered
a
heavy
gale
which
split
the
sails
swept
the
decks
and
drove
us
off
our
course
as
far
south
as
ocracoke
inlet
on
the
coast
of
north
carolina
i
took
a
pilot
intending
to
go
in
to
repair
damages
but
owing
to
the
strength
of
the
current
which
defeated
his
calculations
the
pilot
ran
us
on
the
bar
as
soon
as
the
schooner
bow
touched
the
ground
she
swung
round
broadside
to
the
sea
which
immediately
began
to
break
over
her
in
a
fearful
manner
she
filled
immediately
everything
on
deck
was
swept
away
and
as
our
only
chance
of
safety
we
took
to
the
this
was
about
seven
in
the
evening
towards
morning
by
reason
of
the
continual
thumping
the
mainmast
began
to
work
through
the
vessel
and
to
settle
in
the
sand
so
that
it
became
necessary
for
us
to
make
our
way
to
the
which
we
did
not
without
danger
as
one
of
the
men
was
twice
washed
off
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
inside
was
a
small
low
island
on
which
lay
five
boats
each
manned
by
five
men
who
had
come
down
to
our
assistance
but
the
surf
was
so
high
that
they
did
not
venture
to
approach
us
so
we
remained
clinging
with
difficulty
to
the
rigging
till
about
one
when
the
schooner
went
to
pieces
the
mast
to
which
we
were
clinging
fell
and
we
were
precipitated
into
the
raging
surf
which
swept
us
onward
towards
the
island
already
mentioned
the
men
there
anticipating
what
had
happened
had
prepared
for
its
occurrence
and
the
best
swimmers
with
ropes
tied
round
their
waists
the
other
end
of
which
was
held
by
those
on
shore
plunged
in
to
our
assistance
one
of
our
unfortunate
company
was
drowned
the
rest
of
us
came
safely
to
the
shore
but
we
lost
everything
except
the
clothes
we
stood
in
the
fragments
saved
from
the
wreck
were
sold
at
auction
for
two
hundred
dollars
the
people
of
that
neighborhood
treated
us
with
great
kindness
and
we
presently
took
the
packet
for
elizabeth
city
whence
i
proceeded
to
norfolk
baltimore
and
so
home
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
go
to
sea
no
more
but
after
remaining
on
shore
for
three
weeks
and
not
finding
anything
else
to
do
as
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
have
the
means
of
supporting
my
increasing
family
i
took
the
command
of
another
vessel
belonging
to
the
same
owners
the
sloop
joseph
b
while
in
this
vessel
my
voyages
were
to
the
eastward
i
was
engaged
in
the
in
conjunction
with
the
owners
of
the
vessel
we
bought
flour
and
grain
on
a
sixty
days
credit
which
i
carried
to
the
kennebec
portsmouth
boston
new
bedford
and
other
eastern
ports
calculating
upon
the
returns
of
the
voyage
to
take
up
our
notes
i
was
so
successful
in
this
business
as
finally
to
become
the
owner
of
the
joseph
which
vessel
i
exchanged
away
at
portsmouth
for
the
sophronia
a
schooner
of
one
hundred
and
sixty
tons
worth
about
fourteen
hundred
dollars
in
this
vessel
i
made
two
trips
to
boston
one
with
coal
and
the
other
with
timber
having
unloaded
my
timber
i
took
in
a
hundred
tons
of
plaster
purchased
on
my
own
account
intending
to
dispose
of
it
in
the
susquehanna
but
on
the
passage
i
encountered
a
heavy
storm
which
blew
the
masts
out
of
the
vessel
and
drove
her
ashore
on
the
south
side
of
long
island
we
saved
our
lives
but
i
lost
everything
except
one
hundred
and
sixty
dollars
for
which
i
sold
what
was
left
of
the
vessel
and
cargo
having
returned
to
my
family
with
but
little
disposition
to
try
my
fortune
again
in
the
one
day
being
in
the
i
purchased
a
horse
and
wagon
and
taking
in
my
wife
and
some
of
the
younger
children
i
went
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
neighborhood
in
which
i
was
born
here
i
traded
for
half
of
a
of
about
sixty
tons
burden
in
which
i
engaged
in
the
and
other
small
having
met
at
baltimore
the
owner
of
the
other
half
i
bought
him
out
also
the
whole
craft
stood
me
in
about
seven
hundred
dollars
i
then
purchased
three
hundred
bushels
of
potatoes
with
which
i
sailed
for
fredericksburg
in
virginia
but
this
proved
a
losing
trip
the
potatoes
not
selling
for
what
they
cost
me
at
fredericksburg
i
took
in
flour
on
freight
for
norfolk
but
my
still
pursued
me
in
unloading
the
vessel
the
cargo
forward
being
first
taken
out
she
settled
by
the
stern
and
sprang
a
leak
damaging
fifteen
barrels
of
flour
which
were
thrown
upon
my
hands
i
then
sailed
for
the
eastern
shore
of
virginia
and
at
a
place
called
cherrystone
traded
off
my
damaged
flour
for
a
cargo
of
pears
with
which
i
sailed
for
new
york
i
proceeded
safely
as
far
as
barnegat
when
i
encountered
a
storm
which
drove
me
back
into
the
delaware
obliging
me
to
seek
refuge
in
the
same
maurice
river
from
which
i
had
commenced
my
life
in
the
wood
business
but
by
this
time
the
pears
were
spoiled
and
i
was
obliged
to
throw
them
overboard
at
cherrystone
i
had
met
the
owner
of
a
who
had
seemed
disposed
to
trade
with
me
for
my
vessel
and
i
now
returned
to
that
place
and
completed
the
trade
after
which
i
loaded
the
with
oysters
and
terrapins
and
sailed
for
philadelphia
this
boat
was
an
excellent
sailer
but
too
sharp
and
not
of
burden
enough
for
my
business
and
i
soon
exchanged
her
for
half
a
little
sloop
in
which
i
carried
a
load
of
to
baltimore
by
this
time
i
was
pretty
well
sick
of
the
water
and
having
hired
out
the
sloop
i
set
up
a
shop
at
philadelphia
for
the
purchase
and
sale
of
junk
old
iron
but
after
continuing
in
this
business
for
about
two
years
my
health
being
bad
and
the
doctor
having
advised
me
to
try
the
water
again
i
bought
half
of
another
sloop
and
engaged
in
trading
up
and
down
chesapeake
bay
returning
home
towards
the
close
of
the
season
with
the
proceeds
of
the
summer
business
i
encountered
in
the
upper
part
of
chesapeake
bay
a
terrible
which
proved
fatal
to
many
vessels
then
in
the
bay
in
attempting
to
make
a
harbor
the
vessel
struck
the
ground
and
knocked
off
her
rudder
and
in
order
to
get
her
off
we
were
obliged
to
throw
over
the
we
drifted
about
all
day
it
still
blowing
and
snowing
and
at
night
let
go
both
anchors
so
we
lay
for
a
night
and
a
day
but
having
neither
boat
rudder
nor
provisions
i
was
finally
obliged
to
slip
the
anchors
and
run
ashore
i
sold
my
half
of
her
as
she
lay
for
ninety
dollars
which
was
all
that
remained
to
me
of
my
investment
and
my
summer
work
not
having
the
means
to
purchase
a
boat
my
health
also
continuing
quite
infirm
the
next
summer
i
hired
one
and
continued
the
same
trade
up
and
down
the
bay
which
i
had
followed
the
previous
summer
my
trading
up
and
down
the
bay
in
the
way
which
i
have
described
of
course
brought
me
a
good
deal
into
contact
with
the
slave
population
no
sooner
indeed
does
a
vessel
known
to
be
from
the
north
anchor
in
any
of
these
waters
and
the
slaves
are
pretty
adroit
in
ascertaining
from
what
state
a
vessel
comes
than
she
is
boarded
if
she
remains
any
length
of
time
and
especially
over
night
by
more
or
less
of
them
in
hopes
of
obtaining
a
passage
in
her
to
a
land
of
freedom
during
my
earlier
voyagings
several
years
before
in
chesapeake
bay
i
had
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
all
these
requests
at
that
time
according
to
an
idea
still
common
enough
i
had
regarded
the
negroes
as
only
fit
to
be
slaves
and
had
not
been
inclined
to
pay
much
attention
to
the
pitiful
tales
which
they
told
me
of
by
their
masters
and
mistresses
but
my
views
upon
this
subject
had
undergone
a
gradual
change
i
knew
it
was
asserted
in
the
declaration
of
independence
that
all
men
are
born
free
and
equal
and
i
had
read
in
the
bible
that
god
had
made
of
one
flesh
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
i
had
found
out
by
intercourse
with
the
negroes
that
they
had
the
same
desires
wishes
and
hopes
as
myself
i
knew
very
well
that
i
should
not
like
to
be
a
slave
even
to
the
best
of
masters
and
still
less
to
such
sort
of
masters
as
the
greater
part
of
the
slaves
seemed
to
have
the
idea
of
having
first
one
child
and
then
another
taken
from
me
as
fast
as
they
grew
large
enough
and
handed
over
to
the
to
be
carried
i
knew
not
where
and
sold
if
they
were
girls
i
knew
not
for
what
purposes
would
have
been
horrible
enough
and
from
instances
which
came
to
my
notice
i
perceived
that
it
was
not
less
horrible
and
distressing
to
the
parties
concerned
in
the
case
of
black
people
than
of
white
ones
i
had
never
read
any
abolition
books
nor
heard
any
abolition
lectures
i
had
frequented
only
methodist
meetings
and
nothing
was
heard
there
about
slavery
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
perceive
why
the
golden
rule
of
doing
to
others
as
you
would
wish
them
to
do
to
you
did
not
apply
to
this
case
had
i
been
a
slave
myself
and
it
is
not
a
great
while
since
the
algerines
used
to
make
slaves
of
our
sailors
white
as
well
as
black
i
should
have
thought
it
very
right
and
proper
in
anybody
who
would
have
ventured
to
assist
me
in
escaping
out
of
bondage
and
the
more
dangerous
it
might
have
been
to
render
such
assistance
the
more
meritorious
i
should
have
thought
the
act
to
be
why
had
not
these
black
people
so
anxious
to
escape
from
their
masters
as
good
a
light
to
their
liberty
as
i
had
to
mine
i
know
it
is
sometimes
said
by
those
who
defend
slavery
or
apologize
for
it
that
the
slaves
at
the
south
are
very
happy
and
contented
if
left
to
themselves
and
that
this
idea
of
running
away
is
only
put
into
their
heads
by
mischievous
white
people
from
the
north
this
will
do
very
well
for
those
who
know
nothing
of
the
matter
personally
and
who
are
anxious
to
listen
to
any
excuse
but
there
is
not
a
waterman
who
ever
sailed
in
chesapeake
bay
who
will
not
tell
you
that
so
far
from
the
slaves
needing
any
prompting
to
run
away
the
difficulty
is
when
they
ask
you
to
assist
them
to
make
them
take
no
for
an
answer
i
have
known
instances
where
men
have
lain
in
the
woods
for
a
year
or
two
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
escape
on
board
some
vessel
on
one
of
my
voyages
up
the
potomac
an
application
was
made
to
me
on
behalf
of
such
a
runaway
and
i
was
so
much
moved
by
his
story
that
had
it
been
practicable
for
me
at
that
time
i
should
certainly
have
helped
him
off
one
or
two
attempts
i
did
make
to
assist
the
flight
of
some
of
those
who
sought
my
assistance
but
none
with
success
till
the
summer
of
which
is
the
period
to
which
i
have
brought
down
my
narrative
i
was
employed
during
that
summer
as
i
have
mentioned
already
in
trading
up
and
down
the
chesapeake
in
a
hired
boat
a
small
black
boy
being
my
only
assistant
among
other
trips
i
went
to
washington
with
a
cargo
of
oysters
while
i
was
lying
there
at
the
same
wharf
as
it
happened
from
which
the
pearl
afterwards
took
her
departure
a
colored
man
came
on
board
and
observing
that
i
seemed
to
be
from
the
north
he
said
he
supposed
we
were
pretty
much
all
abolitionists
there
i
know
where
he
got
this
piece
of
information
but
i
think
it
likely
from
some
southern
member
of
congress
as
i
did
not
check
him
but
rather
encouraged
him
to
go
on
he
finally
told
me
that
he
wanted
to
get
passage
to
the
north
for
a
woman
and
five
children
the
husband
of
the
woman
and
father
of
the
children
was
a
free
colored
man
and
the
woman
under
an
agreement
with
her
master
had
already
more
than
paid
for
her
liberty
but
when
she
had
asked
him
for
a
settlement
he
had
only
answered
by
threatening
to
sell
her
he
begged
me
to
see
the
woman
which
i
did
and
finally
i
made
an
arrangement
to
take
them
away
their
bedding
and
other
things
were
sent
down
on
board
the
vessel
in
open
day
and
at
night
the
woman
came
on
board
with
her
five
children
and
a
niece
we
were
ten
days
in
reaching
frenchtown
where
the
husband
was
in
waiting
for
them
he
took
them
under
his
charge
and
i
saw
them
no
more
but
since
my
release
from
imprisonment
in
washington
i
have
heard
that
the
whole
family
are
comfortably
established
in
a
free
country
and
doing
well
having
accomplished
this
exploit
and
was
it
not
something
of
an
exploit
to
bestow
the
invaluable
gift
of
liberty
upon
seven
of
the
season
being
now
far
advanced
i
gave
up
the
boat
to
the
owner
and
returned
to
my
family
at
philadelphia
in
the
course
of
the
following
month
of
february
i
received
a
note
from
a
person
whom
i
had
never
known
or
heard
of
before
desiring
me
to
call
at
a
certain
place
named
in
it
i
did
so
when
it
appeared
that
i
had
been
heard
of
through
the
colored
family
which
i
had
brought
off
from
washington
a
letter
from
that
city
was
read
to
me
relating
the
case
of
a
family
or
two
who
expected
daily
and
hourly
to
be
sold
and
desiring
assistance
to
get
them
away
it
was
proposed
to
me
to
undertake
this
enterprise
but
i
declined
it
at
this
time
as
i
had
no
vessel
and
because
the
season
was
too
early
for
navigation
through
the
canal
i
saw
the
same
person
again
about
a
fortnight
later
and
finally
arranged
to
go
on
to
washington
to
see
what
could
be
done
there
i
agreed
to
return
again
so
soon
as
i
could
find
a
vessel
fit
for
the
enterprise
i
spoke
with
several
persons
of
my
acquaintance
who
had
vessels
under
their
control
but
they
declined
on
account
of
the
danger
they
did
not
appear
to
have
any
other
objection
and
seemed
to
wish
me
success
passing
along
the
street
i
met
captain
sayres
and
knowing
that
he
was
sailing
a
small
called
the
pearl
and
learning
from
him
that
business
was
dull
with
him
i
proposed
the
enterprise
to
him
offering
him
one
hundred
dollars
for
the
charter
of
his
vessel
to
washington
and
back
to
frenchtown
where
according
to
the
arrangement
with
the
friends
of
the
passengers
they
were
to
be
met
and
carried
to
philadelphia
this
was
considerably
more
than
the
vessel
could
earn
in
any
ordinary
trip
of
the
like
duration
and
sayres
closed
with
the
offer
he
fully
understood
the
nature
of
the
enterprise
by
our
bargain
i
was
to
have
as
supercargo
the
control
of
the
vessel
so
far
as
related
to
her
freight
and
was
to
bring
away
from
washington
such
passengers
as
i
chose
to
receive
on
board
but
the
control
of
the
vessel
in
other
respects
remained
with
him
captain
sayres
engaged
in
this
enterprise
merely
as
a
matter
of
business
i
too
was
to
be
paid
for
my
time
and
trouble
an
offer
which
the
low
state
of
my
pecuniary
affairs
and
the
necessity
of
supporting
my
family
did
not
allow
me
to
decline
but
this
was
not
by
any
means
my
sole
or
principal
motive
i
undertook
it
out
of
sympathy
for
the
enslaved
and
from
my
desire
to
do
something
to
further
the
cause
of
universal
liberty
such
being
the
different
ground
upon
which
sayres
and
myself
stood
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
or
expedient
to
communicate
to
him
the
names
of
the
persons
with
whom
the
expedition
had
originated
and
at
my
suggestion
those
persons
abstained
from
any
direct
communication
with
him
either
at
philadelphia
or
washington
sayres
had
as
cook
and
sailor
on
board
the
pearl
a
young
man
named
chester
english
he
was
married
and
had
a
child
or
two
but
was
himself
as
inexperienced
as
a
child
having
never
been
more
than
thirty
miles
from
the
place
where
he
was
born
i
remonstrated
with
sayres
against
taking
this
young
man
with
us
but
english
pleased
with
the
idea
of
seeing
washington
desired
to
go
and
sayres
who
had
engaged
him
for
the
season
did
not
like
to
part
with
him
he
went
with
us
but
was
kept
in
total
ignorance
of
the
real
object
of
the
voyage
he
had
the
idea
that
we
were
going
to
washington
for
a
load
of
we
proceeded
down
the
delaware
and
by
the
canal
into
the
chesapeake
making
for
the
mouth
of
the
potomac
as
we
ascended
that
river
we
stopped
at
a
place
called
machudock
where
i
purchased
by
way
of
cargo
and
cover
to
the
voyage
twenty
cords
of
wood
and
with
that
freight
on
board
we
proceeded
to
washington
where
we
arrived
on
the
evening
of
thursday
the
of
april
as
it
happened
we
found
that
city
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
on
the
subject
of
emancipation
liberty
and
the
rights
of
man
a
grand
procession
was
on
foot
in
honor
of
the
new
french
revolution
the
expulsion
of
and
the
establishment
of
a
republic
in
france
bonfires
were
blazing
in
the
public
squares
and
a
great
meeting
was
being
held
in
front
of
the
newspaper
office
at
which
very
enthusiastic
and
exciting
speeches
were
delivered
principally
by
southern
democratic
members
of
congress
which
body
was
at
that
time
in
session
a
full
account
of
these
proceedings
with
reports
of
the
speeches
was
given
in
the
of
the
next
day
according
to
this
report
foote
the
senator
from
mississippi
extolled
the
french
revolution
as
holding
out
to
the
whole
family
of
man
a
bright
promise
of
the
universal
establishment
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
he
declared
in
the
same
speech
that
the
age
of
tyrants
and
of
slavery
was
rapidly
drawing
to
a
close
and
that
the
happy
period
to
be
signalized
by
the
of
man
from
the
fetters
of
civic
oppression
and
the
recognition
in
all
countries
of
the
great
principles
of
popular
sovereignty
equality
and
brotherhood
was
at
this
moment
visibly
commencing
stanton
of
tennessee
and
others
spoke
in
a
strain
equally
fervid
and
philanthropic
i
am
obliged
to
refer
to
the
newspaper
for
an
account
of
these
speeches
as
i
did
not
hear
them
myself
i
came
to
washington
not
to
preach
nor
to
hear
preached
emancipation
equality
and
brotherhood
but
to
put
them
into
practice
sayres
and
english
went
up
to
see
the
procession
and
hear
the
speeches
i
had
other
things
to
attend
to
the
news
of
my
arrival
soon
spread
among
those
who
had
been
expecting
it
though
i
neither
saw
nor
had
any
direct
communication
with
any
of
those
who
were
to
be
my
passengers
i
had
some
difficulty
in
disposing
of
my
wood
which
was
not
a
very
article
but
finally
sold
it
taking
in
payment
the
purchaser
note
on
sixty
days
which
i
changed
off
for
half
cash
and
half
provisions
as
the
trader
to
whom
i
passed
the
note
had
no
hard
bread
sayres
and
myself
went
in
the
steamer
to
alexandria
to
purchase
a
barrel
a
circumstance
of
which
it
was
afterwards
attempted
to
take
advantage
against
us
it
was
arranged
that
the
passengers
should
come
on
board
after
dark
on
saturday
evening
and
that
we
should
sail
about
midnight
i
had
understood
that
the
expedition
had
principally
originated
in
the
desire
to
help
off
a
certain
family
consisting
of
a
woman
nine
children
and
two
who
were
believed
to
be
legally
entitled
to
their
liberty
their
case
had
been
in
litigation
for
some
time
but
although
they
had
a
very
good
case
the
lawyer
whom
they
employed
bradley
one
of
the
most
distinguished
members
of
the
bar
of
the
district
testified
in
the
course
of
one
of
my
trials
that
he
believed
them
to
be
legally
free
yet
as
their
money
was
nearly
exhausted
and
as
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
the
law
delay
and
the
pertinacity
of
the
woman
who
claimed
them
it
was
deemed
best
by
their
friends
that
they
should
get
away
if
they
could
lest
she
might
seize
them
unawares
and
sell
them
to
some
trader
in
speaking
of
this
case
the
person
with
whom
i
communicated
at
washington
informed
me
that
there
were
also
quite
a
number
of
others
who
wished
to
avail
themselves
of
this
opportunity
of
escaping
and
that
the
number
of
passengers
was
likely
to
be
larger
than
had
at
first
been
calculated
upon
to
which
i
replied
that
i
did
not
stand
about
the
number
that
all
who
were
on
board
before
eleven
i
should
take
the
others
would
have
to
remain
behind
saturday
evening
at
supper
i
let
english
a
little
into
the
secret
of
what
i
intended
i
told
him
that
the
sort
of
we
were
going
to
take
would
prove
very
easy
to
load
and
unload
that
a
number
of
colored
people
wished
to
take
passage
with
us
down
the
bay
and
that
as
sayres
and
myself
would
be
away
the
greater
part
of
the
evening
all
he
had
to
do
was
as
fast
as
they
came
on
board
to
lift
up
the
hatch
and
let
them
pass
into
the
hold
shutting
the
hatch
down
upon
them
the
vessel
which
we
had
moved
down
the
river
since
unloading
the
wood
lay
at
a
rather
lonely
place
called
wharf
from
a
building
which
stood
upon
it
the
high
bank
of
the
river
under
which
a
road
passed
afforded
a
cover
to
the
wharf
and
there
were
only
a
few
scattered
buildings
in
the
vicinity
towards
the
town
there
stretched
a
wide
extent
of
open
fields
anxious
as
might
naturally
be
expected
as
to
the
result
i
kept
in
the
vicinity
to
watch
the
progress
of
events
there
was
another
small
vessel
that
lay
across
the
head
of
the
same
wharf
but
her
crew
were
all
black
and
going
on
board
her
just
at
dusk
i
informed
the
skipper
of
my
business
intimating
to
him
at
the
same
time
that
it
would
be
a
dangerous
thing
for
him
to
betray
me
he
assured
me
that
i
need
have
no
fears
of
him
that
the
other
men
would
soon
leave
the
vessel
not
to
return
again
till
monday
and
that
for
himself
he
should
go
below
and
to
sleep
so
as
neither
to
hear
nor
to
see
anything
shortly
after
dark
the
expected
passengers
began
to
arrive
coming
stealthily
across
the
fields
and
gliding
silently
on
board
the
vessel
i
observed
a
man
near
a
neighboring
who
seemed
to
be
watching
them
i
went
towards
him
and
found
him
to
be
black
he
told
me
that
he
understood
what
was
going
on
but
that
i
need
have
no
apprehension
of
him
two
white
men
who
walked
along
the
road
past
the
vessel
and
who
presently
returned
back
the
same
way
occasioned
me
some
alarm
but
they
seemed
to
have
no
suspicions
of
what
was
on
foot
as
i
saw
no
more
of
them
i
went
on
board
the
vessel
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
evening
and
learned
from
english
that
the
hold
was
fast
filling
up
i
had
promised
him
in
consideration
of
the
unusual
nature
of
the
business
we
were
engaged
in
ten
dollars
as
a
gratuity
in
addition
to
his
wages
something
past
ten
i
went
on
board
and
directed
english
to
cast
off
the
fastenings
and
to
get
ready
to
make
sail
pretty
soon
sayres
came
on
board
it
was
a
dead
calm
and
we
were
obliged
to
get
the
boat
out
to
get
the
vessel
head
round
after
dropping
down
a
half
a
mile
or
so
we
encountered
the
tide
making
up
the
river
and
as
there
was
still
no
wind
we
were
obliged
to
anchor
here
we
lay
in
a
dead
calm
till
about
daylight
the
wind
then
began
to
breeze
up
lightly
from
the
northward
when
we
got
up
the
anchor
and
made
sail
as
the
sun
rose
we
passed
alexandria
i
then
went
into
the
hold
for
the
first
time
and
there
found
my
passengers
pretty
thickly
stowed
i
distributed
bread
among
them
and
knocked
down
the
bulkhead
between
the
hold
and
the
cabin
in
order
that
they
might
get
into
the
cabin
to
cook
they
consisted
of
men
and
women
in
pretty
equal
proportions
with
a
number
of
boys
and
girls
and
two
small
children
the
wind
kept
increasing
and
hauling
to
the
westward
off
fort
washington
we
had
to
make
two
stretches
but
the
rest
of
the
way
we
run
before
the
wind
shortly
after
dinner
we
passed
the
steamer
from
baltimore
for
washington
bound
up
i
thought
the
passengers
on
board
took
particular
notice
of
us
but
the
number
of
vessels
met
with
in
a
passage
up
the
potomac
at
that
season
is
so
few
as
to
make
one
at
least
for
the
idle
passengers
of
a
steamboat
an
object
of
some
curiosity
just
before
sunset
we
passed
a
schooner
loaded
with
plaster
bound
up
as
we
approached
the
mouth
of
the
potomac
the
wind
hauled
to
the
north
and
blew
with
such
stiffness
as
would
make
it
impossible
for
us
to
go
up
the
bay
according
to
our
original
plan
under
these
circumstances
apprehending
a
pursuit
from
washington
i
urged
sayres
to
go
to
sea
with
the
intention
of
reaching
the
delaware
by
the
outside
passage
but
he
objected
that
the
vessel
was
not
fit
to
go
outside
which
was
true
enough
and
that
the
bargain
was
to
go
to
frenchtown
having
reached
point
lookout
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
not
being
able
to
persuade
sayres
to
go
to
sea
and
the
wind
being
dead
in
our
teeth
and
too
strong
to
allow
any
attempt
to
ascend
the
bay
we
came
to
anchor
in
cornfield
harbor
just
under
point
lookout
a
shelter
usually
sought
by
encountering
contrary
winds
when
in
that
neighborhood
we
were
all
sleepy
with
being
up
all
the
night
before
and
soon
after
dropping
anchor
we
all
turned
in
i
knew
nothing
more
till
waking
suddenly
i
heard
the
noise
of
a
steamer
blowing
off
steam
alongside
of
us
i
knew
at
once
that
we
were
taken
the
black
men
came
to
the
cabin
and
asked
if
they
should
fight
i
told
them
no
we
had
no
arms
nor
was
there
the
least
possibility
of
a
successful
resistance
the
loud
shouts
and
trampling
of
many
feet
overhead
proved
that
our
assailants
were
numerous
one
of
them
lifted
the
hatch
a
little
and
cried
out
niggers
by
g
d
an
exclamation
to
which
the
others
responded
with
three
cheers
and
by
banging
the
buts
of
their
muskets
against
the
deck
a
lantern
was
called
for
to
read
the
name
of
the
vessel
and
it
being
ascertained
to
be
the
pearl
a
number
of
men
came
to
the
and
called
for
captain
drayton
i
was
in
no
great
hurry
to
stir
but
at
length
rose
from
my
berth
saying
that
i
considered
myself
their
prisoner
and
that
i
expected
to
be
treated
as
such
while
i
was
dressing
rather
too
slowly
for
the
impatience
of
those
outside
a
sentinel
who
had
been
stationed
at
the
followed
every
motion
of
mine
with
his
gun
which
he
kept
pointed
at
me
in
great
apprehension
apparently
lest
i
should
suddenly
seize
some
dangerous
weapon
and
make
at
him
as
i
came
out
of
the
two
of
them
seized
me
took
me
on
board
the
steamer
and
tied
me
and
they
did
the
same
with
sayres
and
english
who
were
brought
on
board
one
after
the
other
the
black
people
were
left
on
board
the
pearl
which
the
steamer
took
in
tow
and
then
proceeded
up
the
river
to
explain
this
sudden
change
in
our
situation
it
is
necessary
to
go
back
to
washington
great
was
the
consternation
in
several
families
of
that
city
on
sunday
morning
to
find
no
breakfast
and
what
was
worse
their
servants
missing
nor
was
this
disaster
confined
to
washington
only
georgetown
came
in
for
a
considerable
share
of
it
and
even
alexandria
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
had
not
entirely
escaped
the
persons
who
had
taken
passage
on
board
the
pearl
had
been
held
in
bondage
by
no
less
than
different
persons
great
was
the
wonder
at
the
sudden
and
simultaneous
disappearance
of
so
many
prime
hands
roughly
estimated
though
probably
with
considerable
exaggeration
as
worth
in
the
market
not
less
than
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
all
at
one
fell
swoop
too
as
the
district
attorney
afterwards
in
arguing
the
case
against
me
pathetically
expressed
it
there
were
a
great
many
guesses
and
conjectures
as
to
where
these
people
had
gone
and
how
they
had
gone
but
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
the
losers
would
have
got
upon
the
right
track
had
it
not
been
for
the
treachery
of
a
colored
hackman
who
had
been
employed
to
carry
down
to
the
vessel
two
passengers
who
had
been
in
hiding
for
some
weeks
previous
and
who
could
not
safely
walk
down
lest
they
might
be
met
and
recognized
emulating
the
example
of
that
large
and
in
their
own
opinion
at
least
highly
moral
religious
and
respectable
class
of
white
people
known
as
this
hackman
thought
it
a
fine
opportunity
to
feather
his
nest
by
playing
to
the
seeing
how
much
the
information
was
in
demand
and
anticipating
no
doubt
a
large
reward
he
turned
informer
and
described
the
pearl
as
the
conveyance
which
the
fugitives
had
taken
and
it
being
ascertained
that
the
pearl
had
actually
sailed
between
saturday
night
and
sunday
morning
preparations
were
soon
made
to
pursue
her
a
mr
dodge
of
georgetown
a
wealthy
old
gentleman
originally
from
new
england
missed
three
or
four
slaves
from
his
family
and
a
small
steamboat
of
which
he
was
the
proprietor
was
readily
obtained
men
including
a
son
or
two
of
old
dodge
and
several
of
those
whose
slaves
were
missing
volunteered
to
man
her
and
they
set
out
about
sunday
noon
armed
to
the
teeth
with
guns
pistols
and
well
provided
with
brandy
and
other
liquors
they
heard
of
us
on
the
passage
down
from
the
baltimore
steamer
and
the
vessel
loaded
with
plaster
they
reached
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
not
having
found
the
pearl
were
about
to
return
as
the
steamer
could
not
proceed
into
the
bay
without
forfeiting
her
insurance
as
a
last
chance
they
looked
into
cornfield
harbor
where
they
found
us
as
i
have
related
this
was
about
two
in
the
morning
the
pearl
had
come
to
anchor
about
nine
the
previous
evening
it
is
a
hundred
and
forty
miles
from
washington
to
cornfield
harbor
the
steamer
with
the
pearl
in
tow
crossed
over
from
point
lookout
to
piney
point
on
the
south
shore
of
the
potomac
and
here
the
pearl
was
left
at
anchor
a
part
of
the
steamer
company
remaining
to
guard
her
while
the
steamer
having
myself
and
the
other
white
prisoners
on
board
proceeded
up
coan
river
for
a
supply
of
wood
having
obtained
which
she
again
about
noon
of
monday
took
the
pearl
in
tow
and
started
for
washington
the
bearing
manner
and
aspect
of
the
armed
persons
by
whom
we
had
been
thus
seized
and
bound
without
the
slightest
shadow
of
lawful
authority
was
sufficient
to
inspire
a
good
deal
of
alarm
we
had
been
lying
quietly
at
anchor
in
a
harbor
of
maryland
and
although
the
owners
of
the
slaves
might
have
had
a
legal
right
to
pursue
and
take
them
back
what
warrant
or
authority
had
they
for
seizing
us
and
our
vessel
they
could
have
brought
none
from
the
district
of
columbia
whose
officers
had
no
jurisdiction
or
authority
in
cornfield
harbor
nor
did
they
pretend
to
have
any
from
the
state
of
maryland
some
of
them
showed
a
good
deal
of
excitement
and
evinced
a
disposition
to
proceed
to
lynch
us
at
once
a
man
named
houver
who
claimed
as
his
property
two
of
the
boys
passengers
on
board
the
pearl
put
me
some
questions
in
a
very
insolent
tone
to
which
i
replied
that
i
considered
myself
a
prisoner
and
did
not
wish
to
answer
any
questions
whereupon
one
of
the
bystanders
flourishing
a
dirk
in
my
face
exclaimed
if
i
was
in
his
place
i
put
this
through
you
at
piney
point
one
of
the
company
proposed
to
hang
me
up
to
the
and
make
me
confess
but
the
more
influential
of
those
on
board
were
not
ready
for
any
such
violence
though
all
were
exceedingly
anxious
to
get
out
of
me
the
history
of
the
expedition
and
who
my
employers
were
that
i
had
employers
and
persons
of
note
too
was
taken
for
granted
on
all
hands
nor
did
i
think
it
worth
my
while
to
contradict
it
though
i
declined
steadily
to
give
any
information
on
that
point
sayres
and
english
very
readily
told
all
that
they
knew
english
especially
was
in
a
great
state
of
alarm
and
cried
most
bitterly
i
pitied
him
much
besides
feeling
some
compunctions
at
getting
him
thus
into
difficulty
and
upon
the
representations
which
i
made
that
he
came
to
washington
in
perfect
ignorance
of
the
object
of
the
expedition
he
was
finally
untied
as
sayres
was
obliged
to
admit
that
he
came
to
washington
to
take
away
colored
passengers
he
was
not
regarded
with
so
much
favor
but
it
was
evidently
me
whom
they
looked
upon
as
the
chief
culprit
alone
possessing
a
knowledge
of
the
history
and
origin
of
the
expedition
which
they
were
so
anxious
to
unravel
they
accordingly
went
to
work
very
artfully
to
worm
this
secret
out
of
me
i
was
placed
in
charge
of
one
orme
a
of
georgetown
whose
manner
towards
me
was
such
as
to
inspire
me
with
a
certain
confidence
in
him
who
as
it
afterwards
appeared
from
his
testimony
on
the
trial
carefully
took
minutes
but
as
it
proved
very
confused
and
incorrect
ones
of
all
that
i
said
hoping
thus
to
secure
something
that
might
turn
out
to
my
disadvantage
another
person
with
whom
i
had
a
good
deal
of
conversation
and
who
was
afterwards
produced
as
a
witness
against
me
was
william
craig
in
my
opinion
a
much
more
conscientious
person
than
orme
who
seemed
to
think
that
it
was
part
of
his
duty
as
a
to
testify
to
something
at
all
hazards
to
help
on
a
conviction
but
this
is
a
subject
to
which
i
shall
have
occasion
to
return
presently
in
one
particular
at
least
the
testimony
of
both
these
witnesses
was
correct
enough
they
both
testified
to
my
expressing
pretty
serious
apprehensions
of
what
the
result
to
myself
was
likely
to
be
what
the
particular
provisions
were
in
the
district
of
columbia
as
to
helping
slaves
to
escape
i
did
not
know
but
i
had
heard
that
in
some
of
the
they
were
very
severe
in
fact
i
was
assured
by
craig
that
i
had
committed
the
highest
crime
next
to
murder
known
in
their
laws
under
these
circumstances
i
made
up
my
mind
that
the
least
penalty
i
should
be
apt
to
escape
with
was
confinement
in
the
penitentiary
for
life
and
it
is
quite
probable
that
i
endeavored
to
console
myself
as
these
witnesses
testified
with
the
idea
that
after
all
it
might
in
a
religious
point
of
view
be
all
for
the
best
as
i
should
thus
be
removed
from
temptation
and
have
ample
time
for
reflection
and
repentance
but
my
apprehensions
were
by
no
means
limited
to
what
i
might
suffer
under
the
forms
of
law
from
the
temper
exhibited
by
some
of
my
captors
and
from
the
vindictive
fury
with
which
the
idea
of
enabling
the
enslaved
to
regain
their
liberty
was
i
knew
generally
regarded
at
the
south
i
apprehended
more
sudden
and
summary
proceedings
and
what
happened
afterwards
at
washington
proved
that
these
apprehensions
were
not
wholly
unfounded
the
idea
of
being
torn
in
pieces
by
a
furious
mob
was
exceedingly
disagreeable
many
men
who
might
not
fear
death
might
yet
not
choose
to
meet
it
in
that
shape
i
called
to
mind
the
apology
of
the
methodist
minister
who
just
after
a
declaration
of
his
that
he
was
not
afraid
to
die
ran
away
from
a
furious
bull
that
attacked
him
that
though
not
fearing
death
he
did
not
like
to
be
torn
in
pieces
by
a
mad
bull
i
related
this
anecdote
to
craig
and
as
he
testified
on
the
trial
expressed
my
preference
to
be
taken
on
the
deck
of
the
steamer
and
shot
at
once
rather
than
to
be
given
up
to
a
washington
mob
to
be
baited
and
murdered
i
talked
pretty
freely
with
orme
and
craig
about
myself
the
circumstances
under
which
i
had
undertaken
this
enterprise
my
motives
to
it
my
family
my
past
misfortunes
and
the
fate
that
probably
awaited
me
but
they
failed
to
extract
from
me
what
they
seemed
chiefly
to
desire
any
information
which
would
implicate
others
orme
told
me
as
he
afterwards
testified
that
what
the
people
in
the
district
wanted
was
the
principals
and
that
if
i
would
give
information
that
would
lead
to
them
the
owners
of
the
slaves
would
let
me
go
or
sign
a
petition
for
my
pardon
craig
also
made
various
inquiries
tending
to
the
same
point
though
i
was
firmly
resolved
not
to
yield
in
this
particular
yet
i
was
desirous
to
do
all
i
could
to
soften
the
feeling
against
me
and
it
was
doubtless
this
desire
which
led
me
to
make
the
statements
sworn
to
by
orme
and
craig
that
i
had
no
connection
with
the
persons
called
abolitionists
which
was
true
enough
that
i
had
formerly
refused
large
offers
made
me
by
slaves
to
carry
them
away
and
that
in
the
present
instance
i
was
employed
by
others
and
was
to
be
paid
for
my
services
on
arriving
off
fort
washington
the
steamer
anchored
for
the
night
as
the
captors
preferred
to
make
their
triumphant
entry
into
the
city
by
daylight
sayres
and
myself
were
watched
during
the
night
by
a
regular
guard
of
two
men
armed
with
muskets
who
were
relieved
from
time
to
time
before
getting
under
weigh
again
which
they
did
about
seven
in
the
morning
of
tuesday
sayres
and
myself
were
tied
together
and
the
black
people
also
with
the
other
arm
bound
behind
their
backs
as
we
passed
alexandria
we
were
all
ordered
on
deck
and
exhibited
to
the
mob
collected
on
the
wharves
to
get
a
sight
of
us
who
signified
their
satisfaction
by
three
cheers
when
we
landed
at
the
in
washington
which
is
a
mile
and
more
from
pennsylvania
avenue
and
in
a
remote
part
of
the
city
but
few
people
had
yet
assembled
we
were
marched
up
in
a
long
procession
sayres
and
myself
being
placed
at
the
head
of
it
guarded
by
a
man
on
each
side
english
following
next
and
then
the
negroes
as
we
went
along
the
mob
began
to
increase
and
as
we
passed
gannon
that
armed
with
a
knife
rushed
out
and
with
horrid
imprecations
made
a
pass
at
me
which
was
very
near
finding
its
way
through
my
body
instead
of
being
arrested
as
he
ought
to
have
been
this
was
politely
informed
that
i
was
in
the
hands
of
the
law
to
which
he
replied
d
n
the
law
i
have
three
negroes
and
i
will
give
them
all
for
one
thrust
at
this
d
d
scoundrel
and
he
followed
along
waiting
his
opportunity
to
repeat
the
blow
the
crowd
by
this
time
was
greatly
increased
we
met
an
immense
mob
of
several
thousand
persons
coming
down
street
with
the
avowed
intention
of
carrying
us
up
before
the
capitol
and
making
an
exhibition
of
us
there
the
noise
and
confusion
was
very
great
it
seemed
as
if
the
time
for
the
lynching
had
come
when
almost
up
to
pennsylvania
avenue
a
rush
was
made
upon
us
lynch
them
lynch
them
the
d
n
villains
and
other
such
cries
resounded
on
all
sides
those
who
had
us
in
charge
were
greatly
alarmed
and
seeing
no
other
way
to
keep
us
from
the
hands
of
the
mob
they
procured
a
hack
and
put
sayres
and
myself
into
it
the
hack
drove
to
the
jail
the
mob
continuing
to
follow
repeating
their
shouts
and
threats
several
thousand
people
surrounded
the
jail
filling
up
the
enclosure
about
it
our
captors
had
become
satisfied
from
the
statements
made
by
sayres
and
myself
and
from
his
own
statements
and
conduct
that
the
participation
of
english
in
the
affair
was
not
of
a
sort
that
required
any
punishment
and
when
the
mob
made
the
rush
upon
us
the
persons
having
him
in
charge
had
let
him
go
with
the
intention
that
he
should
escape
after
a
while
he
had
found
his
way
back
to
the
steamboat
wharf
but
the
steamer
was
gone
alone
in
a
strange
place
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
he
told
his
story
to
somebody
whom
he
met
who
put
him
in
a
hack
and
sent
him
up
to
the
jail
it
was
a
pity
he
lacked
the
enterprise
to
take
care
of
himself
when
set
at
liberty
as
it
cost
him
four
months
imprisonment
and
his
friends
some
money
i
ought
to
have
mentioned
before
that
on
arriving
within
the
waters
of
the
district
sayres
and
myself
had
been
examined
before
a
justice
of
the
peace
who
was
one
of
the
captors
and
who
had
acted
as
their
leader
he
had
made
out
a
commitment
against
us
but
none
against
english
so
that
the
persons
who
had
him
in
charge
were
right
enough
in
letting
him
go
sayres
and
myself
were
at
first
put
into
the
same
cell
but
towards
night
we
were
separated
a
person
named
goddard
connected
with
the
police
came
to
examine
us
he
went
to
sayres
first
he
then
came
to
me
when
i
told
him
that
as
i
supposed
he
had
got
the
whole
story
out
of
sayres
and
as
it
was
not
best
that
two
stories
should
be
told
i
would
say
nothing
goddard
then
took
from
me
my
money
one
of
the
keepers
threw
me
in
two
thin
blankets
and
i
was
left
to
sleep
as
i
could
the
accommodations
were
not
of
the
most
luxurious
kind
the
cell
had
a
stone
floor
which
with
the
help
of
a
blanket
was
to
serve
also
for
a
bed
there
was
neither
chair
table
stool
nor
any
individual
piece
of
furniture
of
any
kind
except
a
and
a
i
was
refused
my
overcoat
and
valise
and
had
nothing
but
my
to
make
a
pillow
of
with
such
a
pillow
and
the
bare
stone
floor
for
my
bed
looked
upon
by
all
whom
i
saw
with
apparent
abhorrence
and
terror
as
much
so
to
all
appearance
as
if
i
had
been
a
murderer
or
taken
in
some
other
desperate
crime
remembering
the
execrations
which
the
mob
had
belched
forth
against
me
and
uncertain
whether
a
person
would
be
found
to
express
the
least
sympathy
for
me
which
might
not
in
the
existing
state
of
the
public
feeling
be
safe
it
may
be
imagined
that
my
slumbers
were
not
very
sound
meanwhile
the
rage
of
the
mob
had
taken
for
the
moment
another
direction
i
had
heard
it
said
while
we
were
coming
up
in
the
steamboat
that
the
abolition
press
must
be
stopped
and
the
mob
accordingly
as
the
night
came
on
gathered
about
the
office
of
the
with
threats
to
destroy
it
some
little
mischief
was
done
but
the
in
the
city
well
aware
how
dependent
washington
is
upon
the
liberality
of
congress
were
unwilling
that
anything
should
occur
to
place
the
district
in
bad
odor
at
the
north
some
of
them
also
it
is
but
justice
to
believe
could
not
entirely
give
in
to
the
doctrine
and
practice
of
suppressing
free
discussion
by
force
and
by
their
efforts
seconded
by
a
drenching
storm
of
rain
that
came
on
between
nine
and
ten
the
mob
were
persuaded
to
disperse
for
the
present
the
jail
was
guarded
that
night
by
a
strong
body
of
police
serious
apprehensions
being
entertained
lest
the
mob
instigated
by
the
violence
of
many
southern
members
of
congress
should
break
in
and
lynch
us
great
apprehension
also
seemed
to
be
felt
at
the
jail
lest
we
might
be
rescued
and
we
were
subject
during
the
night
to
frequent
examinations
to
see
that
all
was
safe
great
was
the
terror
as
well
as
the
rage
which
the
abolitionists
appeared
to
inspire
they
seemed
to
be
thought
capable
if
not
very
narrowly
watched
of
taking
us
off
through
the
roof
or
the
stone
floor
or
out
of
the
doors
and
from
the
looks
which
the
keepers
gave
me
from
time
to
time
i
could
plainly
enough
read
their
thoughts
that
a
fellow
who
had
ventured
on
such
an
enterprise
as
that
of
the
pearl
was
desperate
and
daring
enough
to
attempt
anything
for
a
poor
prisoner
like
me
so
much
in
the
power
of
his
captors
and
without
the
slightest
means
hopes
or
even
thoughts
of
escape
it
was
some
little
satisfaction
to
observe
the
awe
and
terror
which
he
inspired
of
the
prison
fare
i
shall
have
more
to
say
by
and
by
it
is
sufficient
to
state
here
that
it
was
about
on
a
par
with
the
sleeping
accommodations
and
hardly
of
a
sort
to
give
a
man
in
my
situation
the
necessary
physical
vigor
however
i
thought
little
of
this
at
that
moment
as
i
was
too
sick
and
excited
to
feel
much
disposition
to
eat
the
washington
prison
is
a
large
stone
building
the
front
part
of
the
lower
story
of
which
is
occupied
by
the
or
and
by
the
kitchen
and
sleeping
apartments
for
the
keepers
the
back
part
shut
off
from
the
front
by
strong
grated
doors
has
a
winding
stone
ascending
in
the
middle
on
each
side
of
which
on
each
of
the
three
stories
are
also
shut
off
from
the
by
grated
iron
doors
the
back
wall
of
the
jail
forms
one
side
of
these
passages
which
are
lighted
by
grated
windows
on
the
other
side
are
the
cells
also
with
grated
iron
doors
and
receiving
their
light
and
air
entirely
from
the
passages
the
passages
themselves
have
no
ventilation
except
through
the
doors
and
windows
which
answer
that
purpose
very
imperfectly
the
front
second
story
over
the
contains
the
cells
for
the
female
prisoners
the
front
third
story
is
the
debtors
apartment
the
usage
of
the
jail
always
has
been
except
in
cases
of
insubordination
or
attempted
escape
when
locking
up
in
the
cells
by
day
as
well
as
by
night
has
been
resorted
to
as
a
punishment
to
allow
the
prisoners
during
the
the
use
of
the
passages
for
the
benefit
of
light
air
and
exercise
indeed
it
is
hard
to
conceive
a
more
cruel
punishment
than
to
keep
a
man
locked
up
all
the
time
in
one
of
these
unventilated
cells
on
the
morning
of
the
second
day
of
our
confinement
we
too
were
let
out
into
the
passage
but
we
were
soon
put
back
again
and
not
only
into
separate
cells
but
into
separate
passages
so
as
to
be
entirely
cut
off
from
any
communication
with
each
other
it
was
a
long
time
before
we
were
able
to
regain
the
privilege
of
the
passage
but
for
the
present
i
shall
pass
over
the
internal
economy
and
administration
of
the
prison
and
my
treatment
in
it
intending
further
on
to
give
a
general
sketch
of
that
subject
about
nine
or
ten
giddings
the
member
of
congress
from
ohio
came
to
see
us
there
was
some
disposition
i
understood
not
to
allow
him
to
enter
the
jail
but
giddings
is
a
man
not
easily
repulsed
and
there
is
nobody
of
whom
the
good
people
at
washington
especially
the
who
make
up
so
large
a
part
of
the
population
stand
so
much
in
awe
as
a
member
of
congress
especially
a
member
of
giddings
fearless
determination
he
was
allowed
to
come
in
bringing
another
person
with
him
but
was
followed
into
the
jail
by
a
crowd
of
ruffians
who
compelled
the
turnkey
to
admit
them
into
the
passage
and
who
vented
their
rage
in
execration
and
threats
giddings
said
that
he
had
understood
we
were
here
in
jail
without
counsel
or
friends
and
that
he
had
come
to
let
us
know
that
we
should
not
want
for
either
and
he
introduced
the
person
he
had
brought
with
him
as
one
who
was
willing
to
act
temporarily
as
our
counsel
not
long
after
david
a
hall
a
lawyer
of
the
district
came
to
offer
his
services
to
us
in
the
same
way
key
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
district
and
who
as
such
had
charge
of
the
proceedings
against
us
was
there
at
the
same
time
he
advised
hall
to
leave
the
jail
and
go
home
immediately
as
the
people
outside
were
furious
and
he
ran
the
risk
of
his
life
to
which
hall
replied
that
things
had
come
to
a
pretty
pass
if
a
man
counsel
was
not
to
have
the
privilege
of
talking
with
him
poor
devils
said
the
district
attorney
as
he
went
out
i
pity
them
they
are
to
be
made
for
others
yet
the
rancor
and
virulence
and
fierce
pertinacity
with
which
this
key
afterwards
pursued
me
did
not
look
much
like
pity
no
doubt
he
was
a
good
deal
irritated
at
his
ill
success
in
getting
any
information
out
of
me
the
passengers
found
on
board
the
pearl
had
been
committed
to
the
jail
as
runaways
and
giddings
on
going
up
to
the
house
by
way
of
warning
i
suppose
to
the
that
they
were
not
to
be
allowed
to
have
everything
their
own
way
moved
an
inquiry
into
the
circumstances
under
which
persons
were
held
prisoners
in
the
district
jail
merely
for
attempting
to
vindicate
their
inalienable
rights
hale
also
in
the
senate
in
consequence
of
the
threats
held
out
to
destroy
the
office
and
to
put
a
stop
to
the
publication
of
that
paper
moved
a
resolution
of
inquiry
into
the
necessity
of
additional
laws
for
the
protection
of
property
in
the
district
the
fury
which
these
movements
excited
in
the
minds
of
the
found
expression
in
the
editorial
columns
of
the
washington
in
an
article
which
i
have
inserted
below
as
forming
a
curious
contrast
to
the
exultations
of
that
print
only
a
week
before
and
to
which
i
have
had
occasion
already
to
refer
over
the
spread
of
the
principles
of
liberty
and
universal
emancipation
the
violent
attack
upon
giddings
because
he
had
visited
us
three
poor
prisoners
in
jail
and
offered
us
the
assistance
of
counsel
as
if
the
vilest
criminals
were
not
entitled
to
have
counsel
to
defend
them
is
well
worthy
of
notice
the
following
is
the
article
referred
to
the
abolition
incendiaries
those
two
abolition
incendiaries
giddings
and
hale
threw
firebrands
yesterday
into
the
two
houses
of
congress
the
western
abolitionist
moved
a
resolution
of
inquiry
into
the
transactions
now
passing
in
washington
which
brought
on
a
fierce
and
fiery
debate
on
the
part
of
the
southern
members
in
the
course
of
which
giddings
compelled
to
on
the
of
venable
and
haskell
he
had
visited
the
three
piratical
kidnappers
now
confined
in
jail
and
offered
them
the
reply
of
toombs
of
georgia
was
scorching
to
an
intense
degree
the
abolitionist
john
hale
threw
a
firebrand
resolution
into
the
senate
calling
for
additional
laws
to
compel
this
city
to
prevent
riots
this
also
gave
rise
to
a
long
and
excited
debate
no
question
was
taken
in
either
house
before
they
adjourned
but
in
the
progress
of
the
discussion
in
both
houses
some
doctrines
were
uttered
which
are
calculated
to
startle
the
friends
of
the
union
giddings
justified
the
kidnappers
and
contended
that
though
the
act
was
legally
forbidden
it
was
not
morally
wrong
toombs
brought
home
the
practical
consequences
of
this
doctrine
to
the
member
from
ohio
in
a
most
impressive
manner
hale
of
the
senate
whilst
he
was
willing
to
protect
the
abolitionist
expressed
himself
willing
to
relax
the
laws
and
weaken
the
protection
which
is
given
to
the
slave
property
in
this
district
davis
of
massachusetts
held
the
strange
doctrine
that
while
he
would
not
disturb
the
rights
of
the
he
would
not
cease
to
discuss
those
rights
as
if
congress
ought
to
discuss
or
to
protect
a
right
to
discuss
a
domestic
institution
of
the
southern
states
with
which
they
had
no
right
to
interfere
why
discuss
when
they
can
not
act
why
first
lay
down
an
abstract
principle
which
they
intend
to
violate
in
practice
such
fanatics
as
giddings
and
hale
are
doing
more
mischief
than
they
will
be
able
to
atone
for
their
incessant
and
impertinent
intermeddling
with
the
most
delicate
question
in
our
social
relations
is
creating
the
most
indignant
feelings
in
the
community
the
fiery
discussions
they
are
exciting
are
calculated
to
provoke
the
very
riots
which
they
deprecate
let
these
madmen
forbear
if
they
value
the
tranquillity
of
our
country
and
the
stability
of
our
union
we
conjure
them
to
forbear
their
maddened
parricidal
hand
an
article
like
this
in
the
was
well
calculated
and
probably
was
intended
to
encourage
and
stimulate
the
rioters
and
accordingly
they
assembled
that
same
evening
in
greater
force
than
before
threatening
the
destruction
of
the
office
the
publication
office
of
the
was
not
far
from
the
patent
office
and
the
of
bailey
the
editor
was
at
no
great
distance
the
mob
taking
upon
themselves
the
character
of
a
meeting
of
citizens
appointed
a
committee
to
wait
upon
bailey
to
require
him
to
remove
his
press
out
of
the
district
of
columbia
of
course
as
i
was
locked
up
in
the
jail
trying
to
rest
my
aching
head
and
weary
limbs
with
a
stone
floor
for
a
bed
and
a
for
my
pillow
i
can
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
what
transpired
on
this
occasion
but
a
correspondent
of
the
new
york
who
probably
was
an
gives
the
following
account
of
the
interview
between
the
committee
and
bailey
clearing
his
throat
the
leader
of
the
committee
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
thus
addressed
bailey
sir
we
have
been
appointed
as
a
committee
to
wait
upon
you
by
the
meeting
of
the
citizens
of
washington
which
has
assembled
this
evening
to
take
into
consideration
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
late
outrage
upon
property
and
to
convey
to
you
the
result
of
the
deliberations
of
that
meeting
you
are
aware
of
the
excitement
which
now
prevails
it
has
assumed
a
most
threatening
aspect
this
community
is
satisfied
that
the
existence
of
your
press
among
us
is
endangering
the
public
peace
and
they
are
convinced
that
the
public
interests
demand
its
removal
we
have
therefore
waited
upon
you
for
the
purpose
of
inquiring
whether
you
are
prepared
to
remove
your
press
by
ten
morning
and
we
beseech
you
as
you
value
the
peace
of
this
district
to
accede
to
our
request
loud
shouting
heard
at
the
patent
office
gentlemen
i
do
not
believe
you
are
actuated
by
any
unkind
feelings
towards
me
personally
but
you
must
be
aware
that
you
are
demanding
of
me
the
surrender
of
a
great
constitutional
right
a
right
which
i
have
used
but
not
abused
in
the
preservation
of
which
you
are
as
deeply
interested
as
i
am
how
can
you
ask
me
to
abandon
it
and
thus
become
a
party
to
my
own
degradation
we
subscribe
to
all
that
you
say
but
you
see
the
popular
excitement
the
consequences
of
your
refusal
are
inevitable
now
if
you
can
avert
these
consequences
by
submitting
to
what
the
people
request
although
unreasonable
is
it
not
your
duty
as
a
good
citizen
to
submit
it
is
on
account
of
the
community
we
come
here
obeying
the
popular
feeling
which
you
hear
expressed
in
the
distance
and
which
can
not
be
calmed
and
but
for
the
course
we
have
adopted
would
at
this
moment
be
manifested
in
the
destruction
of
your
office
but
they
have
consented
to
wait
till
they
hear
our
report
we
trust
then
that
as
a
good
citizen
you
will
respond
favorably
to
the
wish
of
the
people
of
the
as
one
of
the
oldest
citizens
i
do
assure
you
that
it
is
in
all
kindness
we
make
this
request
we
come
here
to
tell
you
that
we
can
not
arrest
violence
in
any
other
way
than
by
your
allowing
us
to
say
that
you
yield
to
the
request
of
the
people
in
kindness
we
tell
you
that
if
this
thing
commences
here
we
know
not
where
it
may
end
i
am
for
mild
measures
myself
the
prisoners
were
in
my
hands
but
i
would
not
allow
my
men
to
inflict
any
punishment
on
them
gentlemen
i
appreciate
your
kindness
but
i
ask
is
there
a
man
among
you
who
standing
as
i
now
stand
the
representative
of
a
free
press
would
accede
to
this
demand
and
abandon
his
rights
as
an
american
citizen
of
the
we
know
it
is
a
great
sacrifice
that
we
ask
of
you
but
we
ask
it
to
appease
popular
excitement
let
me
say
to
you
that
i
am
a
i
have
taken
no
measures
to
defend
my
office
my
house
or
myself
i
appeal
to
the
good
sense
and
intelligence
of
the
community
and
stand
upon
my
rights
as
an
american
citizen
looking
to
the
law
alone
for
protection
we
have
now
discharged
our
duty
it
has
come
to
this
the
people
say
it
must
be
done
unless
you
agree
to
go
we
now
ask
a
categorical
answer
will
you
remove
your
press
i
answer
i
make
no
resistance
and
i
can
not
assent
to
your
demand
the
press
is
there
it
is
undefended
you
can
do
as
you
think
proper
of
the
all
rests
with
you
we
tell
you
what
will
follow
your
refusal
and
if
you
persist
all
the
responsibility
must
fall
upon
your
shoulders
it
is
in
your
power
to
arrest
the
arm
that
is
raised
to
give
the
blow
if
you
refuse
to
do
so
by
a
single
expression
though
it
might
cost
you
much
on
you
be
all
the
consequences
you
demand
the
sacrifice
of
a
great
right
you
of
the
committee
interrupting
i
know
it
is
a
hardship
but
look
at
the
consequences
of
your
refusal
we
do
not
come
here
to
express
our
individual
opinions
i
would
myself
leave
the
district
if
in
your
place
we
now
ask
of
you
shall
this
be
done
we
beg
you
will
consider
this
matter
in
the
light
in
which
we
view
it
i
am
one
man
against
many
but
i
can
not
sacrifice
any
right
that
i
possess
those
who
have
sent
you
here
may
do
as
they
think
proper
of
the
the
whole
community
is
against
you
they
say
here
is
an
evil
that
threatens
them
and
they
ask
you
to
remove
that
evil
you
say
no
and
of
course
on
your
head
be
all
the
consequences
let
me
remind
you
that
we
have
been
recently
engaged
in
public
rejoicings
for
what
have
we
rejoiced
because
the
people
in
another
land
have
arisen
and
triumphed
over
the
despot
who
had
done
what
he
did
not
demolish
presses
but
he
imprisoned
editors
in
other
words
he
enslaved
the
press
will
you
then
present
to
america
and
the
world
of
the
committee
interrupting
if
we
could
stop
this
movement
of
the
people
we
would
do
it
but
you
make
us
unable
to
do
so
we
can
not
tell
how
far
it
will
go
after
your
press
is
pulled
down
we
do
not
know
where
they
will
go
next
it
is
your
duty
in
such
a
case
to
sacrifice
your
constitutional
rights
i
presume
when
they
shall
have
accomplished
their
object
radcliff
interrupting
we
advise
you
to
be
out
of
the
way
the
people
think
that
your
press
endangers
their
property
and
their
lives
and
they
have
appointed
us
to
tell
you
so
and
ask
you
to
remove
it
if
you
say
that
you
will
do
so
they
will
retire
satisfied
if
you
refuse
they
say
they
will
tear
it
down
here
is
boyle
a
gentleman
of
property
and
one
of
our
oldest
residents
you
see
that
we
are
united
if
you
hold
out
and
occupy
your
position
the
men
women
and
children
of
the
district
will
universally
rise
up
against
you
bailey
addressing
himself
to
his
father
a
venerable
man
of
more
than
eighty
years
of
age
who
approached
the
doorway
and
commenced
remonstrating
with
the
committee
you
do
not
understand
the
matter
father
these
gentlemen
are
a
committee

rights
and

the
committee
then
retired
and
bailey
reëntered
his
dwelling
meanwhile
the
shouts
of
the
mob
as
they
received
the
reports
of
the
committee
were
reëchoed
along
the
streets
a
fierce
yell
greeted
the
reäppearance
of
radcliff
in
front
of
the
patent
office
he
announced
the
result
of
the
interview
with
the
editor
of
the
shouts
imprecations
blasphemy
burst
from
the
crowd
down
with
the
now
for
it
gut
the
office
were
the
exclamations
heard
on
all
sides
and
the
mob
rushed
tumultuously
to
but
a
body
of
the
city
police
had
been
stationed
to
guard
the
building
and
the
mob
finally
contented
themselves
with
passing
a
resolution
to
pull
it
down
the
next
day
at
ten
if
the
press
was
not
meanwhile
removed
that
same
afternoon
we
three
prisoners
had
been
taken
before
three
justices
who
held
a
court
within
the
jail
for
our
examination
hall
appeared
as
our
counsel
the
examination
was
continued
till
the
next
day
when
we
were
all
three
of
us
recommitted
to
jail
on
a
charge
of
stealing
slaves
our
bail
being
fixed
at
a
thousand
dollars
for
each
slave
or
thousand
dollars
for
each
of
us
meanwhile
both
houses
of
congress
became
the
scenes
of
very
warm
debates
growing
out
of
circumstances
connected
with
our
case
in
the
senate
hale
agreeably
to
the
notice
he
had
given
asked
leave
to
introduce
a
bill
for
the
protection
of
property
in
the
district
of
columbia
against
the
violence
of
mobs
this
bill
as
was
stated
in
the
debate
was
copied
almost
word
for
word
from
a
law
in
force
in
the
state
of
maryland
and
many
other
states
have
and
all
ought
to
have
a
similar
law
making
the
cities
and
towns
liable
for
any
property
which
might
be
destroyed
in
them
by
mob
violence
in
the
house
the
subject
came
up
on
a
question
of
privilege
raised
by
palfrey
of
massachusetts
who
offered
a
resolution
for
the
appointment
of
a
select
committee
to
inquire
into
the
facts
that
a
lawless
mob
had
assembled
during
the
two
previous
nights
setting
at
defiance
the
constituted
authorities
of
the
united
states
and
menacing
members
of
congress
and
other
persons
in
both
those
bodies
the
debate
was
very
warm
as
any
one
interested
in
it
will
find
by
reading
it
in
the
columns
of
the
it
was
upon
this
occasion
during
the
debate
in
the
senate
that
foote
then
a
senator
from
mississippi
and
now
governor
of
that
state
whose
speech
on
the
french
revolution
has
been
already
quoted
threatened
to
join
in
lynching
hale
if
he
ever
set
foot
in
mississippi
whither
he
invited
him
to
come
for
that
purpose
this
part
of
the
debate
was
so
peculiar
and
so
characteristic
showing
so
well
the
spirit
with
which
the
district
of
columbia
was
then
blazing
against
me
that
i
can
not
help
giving
the
following
extract
from
foote
speech
as
contained
in
the
official
report
all
must
see
that
the
course
of
the
senator
from
new
hampshire
is
calculated
to
embroil
the
confederacy
to
put
in
peril
our
free
institutions
to
jeopardize
that
union
which
our
forefathers
established
and
which
every
pure
patriot
throughout
the
country
desires
shall
be
perpetuated
can
any
man
be
a
patriot
who
pursues
such
a
course
is
he
an
enlightened
friend
of
freedom
or
even
a
judicious
friend
of
those
with
whom
he
affects
to
sympathize
who
adopts
such
a
course
who
does
not
know
that
such
men
are
practically
the
worst
enemies
of
the
slaves
i
do
not
beseech
the
gentleman
to
stop
but
if
he
perseveres
he
will
awaken
indignation
everywhere
and
it
can
not
be
that
enlightened
men
who
conscientiously
belong
to
the
faction
at
the
north
of
which
he
is
understood
to
be
the
head
can
sanction
or
approve
everything
that
he
may
do
under
the
influence
of
excitement
in
this
body
i
will
close
by
saying
that
if
he
really
wishes
glory
and
to
be
regarded
as
the
great
liberator
of
the
blacks
if
he
wishes
to
be
particularly
distinguished
in
this
cause
of
emancipation
as
it
is
called
let
him
instead
of
remaining
here
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
or
instead
of
secreting
himself
in
some
dark
corner
of
new
hampshire
where
he
may
possibly
escape
the
just
indignation
of
good
men
throughout
this
republic
let
him
visit
the
good
state
of
mississippi
in
which
i
have
the
honor
to
reside
and
no
doubt
he
will
be
received
with
such
shouts
of
joy
as
have
rarely
marked
the
reception
of
any
individual
in
this
day
and
generation
i
invite
him
there
and
will
tell
him
beforehand
in
all
honesty
that
he
could
not
go
ten
miles
into
the
interior
before
he
would
grace
one
of
the
tallest
trees
in
the
forest
with
a
rope
around
his
neck
with
the
approbation
of
every
virtuous
and
patriotic
citizen
and
that
if
necessary
i
should
myself
assist
in
the
operation
hale
reply
was
equally
characteristic
the
honorable
senator
invites
me
to
visit
the
state
of
mississippi
and
kindly
informs
me
that
he
would
be
one
of
those
who
would
act
the
assassin
and
put
an
end
to
my
career
he
would
aid
in
bringing
me
to
public
execution
no
death
by
a
mob
well
in
return
for
his
hospitable
invitation
i
can
only
express
the
desire
that
he
would
penetrate
into
some
of
the
dark
corners
of
new
hampshire
and
if
he
do
i
am
much
mistaken
if
he
would
not
find
that
the
people
in
that
benighted
region
would
be
very
happy
to
listen
to
his
arguments
and
engage
in
an
intellectual
conflict
with
him
in
which
the
truth
might
be
elicited
i
think
however
that
the
announcement
which
the
honorable
senator
has
made
on
this
floor
of
the
fate
which
awaits
so
humble
an
individual
as
myself
in
the
state
of
mississippi
must
convince
every
one
of
the
propriety
of
the
high
eulogium
which
he
pronounced
upon
her
the
other
day
when
he
spoke
of
the
high
position
which
she
occupied
among
the
states
of
this
but
enough
of
this
personal
matter
a
footnote
a
the
following
paragraph
which
has
recently
been
going
the
rounds
of
the
newspapers
will
serve
to
show
the
sort
of
manners
which
prevail
in
the
state
so
fitly
represented
by
foote
and
how
these
southern
ruffians
experience
in
their
own
families
the
natural
effect
of
the
sentiments
which
they
so
freely
avow
the
death
of
mr
the
vicksburg
of
the
gives
the
following
account
of
the
shooting
of
thomas
carneal
of
governor
foote
we
have
abstained
thus
long
from
giving
any
notice
of
the
sad
affair
which
resulted
in
the
death
of
thomas
carneal
the
of
the
governor
of
our
state
that
we
might
get
the
particulars
it
seems
that
the
steamer
watkins
with
carneal
as
a
passenger
landed
at
or
near
the
plantation
of
judge
james
in
washington
county
carneal
had
heard
that
the
judge
was
an
extremely
brutal
man
to
his
slaves
and
was
likewise
excited
with
liquor
and
upon
the
judge
inviting
him
and
others
to
take
a
drink
with
him
carneal
replied
that
he
would
not
drink
with
a
man
who
abused
his
negroes
this
the
judge
resented
as
an
insult
and
high
words
ensued
the
company
took
their
drink
however
all
but
carneal
who
went
out
upon
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
took
a
seat
where
he
was
sought
by
judge
james
who
desired
satisfaction
for
the
insult
carneal
refused
to
make
any
and
asked
the
old
gentleman
if
any
of
his
sons
would
resent
the
insult
if
he
was
to
slap
him
in
the
mouth
to
which
the
judge
replied
that
he
would
do
it
himself
if
his
sons
would
not
whereupon
carneal
struck
him
in
the
month
with
the
back
of
his
hand
the
judge
resented
it
by
striking
him
across
the
head
with
a
cane
which
stunned
carneal
very
much
causing
the
blood
to
run
freely
from
the
wound
as
soon
as
carneal
recovered
from
the
wound
he
drew
a
and
attacked
the
judge
with
it
inflicting
several
wounds
upon
his
person
some
of
which
were
thought
to
be
mortal
some
gentlemen
in
endeavoring
to
separate
the
combatants
were
wounded
by
carneal
when
judge
james
arrived
at
his
house
bleeding
and
in
a
dying
state
as
was
thought
his
son
seized
a
gun
loaded
it
heavily
with
large
shot
galloped
to
where
the
boat
was
hitched
his
horse
and
deliberately
raised
his
gun
to
shoot
carneal
who
was
sitting
upon
a
james
was
warned
not
to
fire
as
carneal
was
unarmed
and
he
might
kill
some
innocent
person
he
took
his
gun
from
his
shoulder
raised
it
again
and
fired
both
barrels
in
succession
killing
carneal
instantly
it
is
a
sad
affair
and
carneal
leaves
besides
numerous
friends
a
most
interesting
and
accomplished
widow
to
bewail
his
tragical
end
such
was
the
savage
character
of
the
debate
that
even
calhoun
who
was
not
generally
discourteous
finding
himself
rather
hard
pressed
by
some
of
hale
arguments
excused
himself
from
an
answer
on
the
ground
that
hale
was
a
maniac
the
set
upon
hale
with
all
their
force
but
though
they
succeeded
in
voting
down
his
bill
it
was
generally
agreed
and
anybody
may
see
by
the
report
that
he
had
altogether
the
best
of
the
argument
palfrey
resolution
was
also
lost
but
the
boldness
with
which
giddings
and
others
avowed
their
opinions
and
the
freedom
of
speech
which
they
used
on
the
subject
of
slavery
afforded
abundant
proof
that
the
gagging
system
which
had
prevailed
so
long
in
congress
had
come
at
last
to
an
end
these
movements
though
the
propositions
of
hale
and
palfrey
were
voted
down
were
not
without
their
effect
the
common
council
of
washington
appointed
an
acting
mayor
in
place
of
the
regular
mayor
who
was
sick
president
polk
sent
an
intimation
to
the
clerks
of
the
departments
some
of
whom
had
been
active
in
the
mobs
that
they
had
better
mind
their
own
business
and
stay
at
home
something
was
said
about
marines
from
the
and
from
that
time
the
riotous
spirit
began
to
subside
meanwhile
the
unfortunate
people
who
had
attempted
to
escape
in
the
pearl
had
to
pay
the
penalty
of
their
love
of
freedom
a
large
number
of
them
as
they
were
taken
out
of
jail
by
the
persons
who
claimed
to
be
their
owners
were
handed
over
to
the
the
following
account
of
the
departure
of
a
portion
of
these
victims
for
the
southern
market
was
given
in
a
letter
which
appeared
at
the
time
in
several
northern
newspapers
last
evening
as
i
was
passing
the
railroad
dépôt
i
saw
a
large
number
of
colored
people
gathered
round
one
of
the
cars
and
from
manifestations
of
grief
among
some
of
them
i
was
induced
to
draw
near
and
ascertain
the
cause
of
it
i
found
in
the
car
towards
which
they
were
so
eagerly
gazing
about
fifty
colored
people
some
of
whom
were
nearly
as
white
as
myself
a
majority
of
them
were
of
the
number
who
attempted
to
gain
their
liberty
last
week
about
half
of
them
were
females
a
few
of
whom
had
but
a
slight
tinge
of
african
blood
in
their
veins
and
were
finely
formed
and
beautiful
the
men
were
ironed
together
and
the
whole
group
looked
sad
and
dejected
at
each
end
of
the
car
stood
two
personages
with
large
canes
in
their
hands
and
if
their
countenances
were
an
index
of
their
hearts
they
were
the
very
impersonation
of
hardened
villany
itself
in
the
middle
of
the
car
stood
the
notorious
of
baltimore
slatter
who
i
learn
is
a
member
of
the
methodist
church
good
and
regular
standing
he
had
purchased
the
men
and
women
around
him
and
was
taking
his
departure
for
georgia
while
observing
this
old
villain
this
dealer
in
the
bodies
and
souls
of
men
the
chaplain
of
the
senate
entered
the
car
a
methodist
brother
and
took
his
brother
slatter
by
the
hand
chatted
with
him
for
some
time
and
seemed
to
view
the
scene
before
him
with
as
little
concern
as
we
should
look
upon
cattle
i
know
not
whether
he
came
with
a
view
to
sanctify
the
act
and
pronounce
a
parting
blessing
but
this
i
do
know
that
he
justifies
slavery
and
denounces
efforts
as
bitterly
as
do
the
most
hardened
a
presbyterian
minister
who
owned
one
of
the
fugitives
was
the
first
to
strike
a
bargain
with
slatter
and
make
merchandise
of
god
image
and
many
of
these
poor
victims
thus
manacled
and
destined
for
the
southern
market
are
regular
members
of
the
african
methodist
church
of
this
city
i
did
not
hear
whether
they
were
permitted
to
get
letters
of
dismission
from
the
church
and
of
to
any
church
where
god
in
his
providence
might
cast
their
lot
probably
a
certificate
from
slatter
to
the
effect
that
they
are
christians
will
answer
every
purpose
no
doubt
he
will
demand
a
good
price
for
slaves
of
this
character
perhaps
brother
slicer
furnished
him
with
testimonials
of
their
religious
character
to
help
their
sale
in
georgia
i
understand
that
he
was
accustomed
to
preach
to
them
here
and
especially
to
urge
upon
them
obedience
to
their
masters
some
of
the
colored
people
outside
as
well
as
in
the
car
were
weeping
most
bitterly
i
learned
that
many
families
were
separated
wives
were
there
to
take
leave
of
their
husbands
and
husbands
of
their
wives
children
of
their
parents
brothers
and
sisters
shaking
hands
perhaps
for
the
last
time
friends
parting
with
friends
and
the
tenderest
ties
of
humanity
sundered
at
the
single
bid
of
the
inhuman
before
them
a
husband
in
the
meridian
of
life
begged
to
see
the
partner
of
his
bosom
he
protested
that
she
was
free
that
she
had
free
papers
and
was
torn
from
him
and
shut
up
in
the
jail
he
clambered
up
to
one
of
the
windows
of
the
car
to
see
his
wife
and
as
she
was
reaching
forward
her
hand
to
him
the
villain
slatter
ordered
him
down
he
did
not
obey
the
husband
and
wife
with
tears
streaming
down
their
cheeks
besought
him
to
let
them
converse
for
a
moment
but
no
a
monster
more
hideous
hardened
and
savage
than
the
blackest
spirit
of
the
pit
knocked
him
down
from
the
car
and
ordered
him
away
the
bystanders
could
hardly
restrain
themselves
from
laying
violent
hands
upon
the
brutes
this
is
but
a
faint
description
of
that
scene
which
took
place
within
a
few
rods
of
the
capitol
under
recognized
by
congress
o
what
a
revolting
scene
to
a
feeling
heart
and
what
a
retribution
awaits
the
actors
will
not
these
wailings
of
anguish
reach
the
ears
of
the
most
high
is
mine
i
will
repay
saith
the
lord
of
those
sent
off
at
this
time
several
through
the
generosity
of
charitable
persons
at
the
north
were
subsequently
redeemed
among
whom
were
the
edmundson
girls
of
whom
an
account
is
given
in
the
key
to
uncle
tom
cabin
from
one
of
the
women
who
was
not
sold
but
retained
at
washington
i
received
a
mark
of
kindness
and
remembrance
for
which
i
felt
very
grateful
she
obtained
admission
to
the
jail
the
sunday
after
our
committal
to
see
some
of
her
late
still
confined
there
and
as
she
passed
the
passage
in
which
i
was
confined
she
called
to
me
and
handed
a
bible
through
the
gratings
i
am
happy
to
be
able
to
add
that
she
has
since
upon
a
second
trial
succeeded
in
effecting
her
escape
and
that
she
is
now
a
free
woman
the
great
excitement
which
our
attempt
at
emancipation
had
produced
at
washington
and
the
rage
and
fury
exhibited
against
us
had
the
effect
to
draw
attention
to
our
case
and
to
secure
us
sympathy
and
assistance
on
the
part
of
persons
wholly
unknown
to
us
a
public
meeting
was
held
in
faneuil
hall
in
boston
on
the
of
april
at
which
a
committee
was
appointed
consisting
of
samuel
may
samuel
howe
samuel
sewell
richard
hildreth
robert
morris
francis
jackson
elizur
wright
joseph
southwick
walter
channing
browne
henry
bowditch
william
channing
joshua
blanchard
and
charles
list
authorized
to
employ
counsel
and
to
collect
money
for
the
purpose
of
securing
to
us
a
fair
trial
of
which
without
some
interference
from
abroad
the
existing
state
of
public
feeling
in
the
district
of
columbia
seemed
to
afford
little
prospect
a
correspondence
was
opened
by
this
committee
with
the
hon
horace
mann
then
a
representative
in
congress
from
the
state
of
massachusetts
with
seward
of
new
york
with
salmon
chase
of
ohio
and
with
fessenden
of
maine
all
of
whom
volunteered
their
gratuitous
services
should
they
be
needed
a
moderate
subscription
was
promptly
obtained
the
larger
part
of
it
as
i
am
informed
through
the
liberality
of
gerrit
smith
now
a
representative
in
congress
from
new
york
whose
large
pecuniary
contributions
to
all
philanthropic
objects
as
well
as
his
zealous
efforts
in
the
same
direction
both
with
the
tongue
and
the
pen
have
made
him
so
conspicuous
he
has
indeed
a
unique
way
of
spending
his
large
fortune
without
precedent
at
least
in
this
country
and
not
likely
to
find
many
imitators
the
committee
being
thus
put
in
funds
deputed
hildreth
one
of
the
members
of
it
to
proceed
to
washington
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
he
arrived
there
toward
the
end
of
the
month
of
may
by
which
time
the
public
excitement
against
us
or
at
least
the
exterior
signs
of
it
had
a
good
deal
subsided
but
we
were
still
treated
with
much
rigor
being
kept
locked
up
in
our
cells
denied
the
use
of
the
passage
and
not
allowed
to
see
anybody
except
when
once
in
a
while
giddings
or
hall
found
an
access
to
us
but
even
then
we
were
not
allowed
to
hold
any
conversation
except
in
the
presence
of
the
jailer
it
may
well
be
imagined
that
the
news
of
my
capture
and
imprisonment
and
of
the
danger
in
which
i
seemed
to
be
had
thrown
my
family
into
great
distress
i
also
had
suffered
exceedingly
on
their
account
several
of
the
children
being
yet
too
young
to
shift
for
themselves
but
i
was
presently
relieved
by
the
information
which
i
received
before
long
that
during
my
imprisonment
my
family
would
be
provided
for
warm
remonstrances
had
been
made
to
the
judge
of
the
criminal
court
by
hall
against
the
attempt
to
exclude
us
from
communication
with
our
friends
a
liberty
freely
granted
to
all
other
prisoners
the
judge
declined
to
interfere
but
mann
having
agreed
to
act
as
our
counsel
was
thenceforth
freely
admitted
to
interviews
with
us
without
the
presence
of
any
keeper
books
and
newspapers
were
furnished
me
by
friends
out
of
doors
i
presently
obtained
a
mattress
and
the
liberty
of
providing
myself
with
better
food
than
the
jail
allows
i
continued
to
suffer
a
good
deal
of
annoyance
from
the
capricious
insolence
and
tyranny
of
the
marshal
robert
wallace
but
i
intend
to
go
more
at
length
into
the
details
of
my
prison
experience
after
having
first
disposed
of
the
legal
proceedings
against
us
the
feeling
against
me
was
no
doubt
greatly
increased
by
the
failure
of
the
efforts
repeatedly
made
to
induce
me
to
give
up
the
names
of
those
who
had
coöperated
with
me
and
to
turn
against
them
there
was
a
certain
taylor
from
boston
i
believe
then
in
washington
the
inventor
of
a
submarine
armor
for
diving
purposes
i
had
formerly
been
well
acquainted
with
him
and
at
a
time
when
no
friend
of
mine
was
allowed
access
to
me
he
made
me
repeated
visits
at
the
jail
at
the
request
as
he
said
of
the
district
attorney
to
induce
me
to
make
a
full
disclosure
in
which
case
it
was
intimated
i
should
be
let
off
very
easy
as
taylor
did
not
prevail
with
me
one
of
the
jailers
afterwards
assured
me
that
he
was
authorized
to
promise
me
a
thousand
dollars
in
case
i
would
become
a
witness
against
those
concerned
with
me
as
i
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
all
these
propositions
the
resolution
seemed
to
be
taken
to
make
me
and
sayres
and
even
english
suffer
in
a
way
to
be
a
warning
to
all
similar
offenders
the
laws
under
which
we
were
to
be
tried
were
those
of
the
state
of
maryland
as
they
stood
previous
to
the
year
these
laws
had
been
temporarily
continued
in
force
over
that
part
of
the
district
ceded
by
maryland
the
whole
of
the
present
district
at
the
time
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
spates
commenced
and
questions
of
more
general
interest
and
the
embarrassment
growing
out
of
the
existence
of
slavery
having
defeated
all
attempts
at
a
revised
code
these
same
old
laws
of
maryland
still
remain
in
force
though
modified
in
some
respects
by
acts
of
congress
in
an
act
of
maryland
passed
in
the
year
and
in
force
in
the
district
there
was
a
section
which
seemed
to
have
been
intended
for
precisely
such
cases
as
ours
it
provided
that
any
person
or
persons
who
shall
hereafter
be
convicted
of
giving
a
pass
to
any
slave
or
person
held
to
service
or
shall
be
found
to
assist
by
advice
donation
or
loan
or
otherwise
the
transporting
of
any
slave
or
any
person
held
to
service
from
this
state
or
by
any
other
unlawful
means
depriving
a
master
or
owner
of
the
service
of
his
slave
or
person
held
to
service
for
every
such
offence
the
party
aggrieved
shall
recover
damages
in
an
action
on
the
case
against
such
offender
or
offenders
and
such
offender
or
offenders
shall
also
be
liable
upon
indictment
and
conviction
upon
verdict
confession
or
otherwise
in
this
state
in
any
county
court
where
such
offence
shall
happen
to
be
fined
a
sum
not
exceeding
two
hundred
dollars
at
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
the
use
of
the
master
or
owner
of
such
slave
the
other
half
to
the
county
school
if
there
be
any
if
there
be
no
such
school
to
the
use
of
the
county
accordingly
the
grand
jury
under
the
instructions
of
the
district
attorney
found
indictments
against
each
of
us
prisoners
based
on
this
act
one
for
each
of
the
slaves
found
on
board
the
vessel
two
excepted
who
were
runaways
from
virginia
and
the
names
of
their
masters
not
known
as
it
would
have
been
possible
to
have
fined
us
about
fifteen
thousand
dollars
apiece
upon
these
indictments
besides
costs
and
as
by
the
laws
of
the
district
there
is
no
method
of
discharging
prisoners
from
jail
who
are
unable
to
pay
a
fine
except
by
an
executive
pardon
one
would
have
thought
that
this
might
have
satisfied
but
the
idea
that
we
should
escape
with
a
fine
though
we
might
be
kept
in
prison
for
life
from
inability
to
pay
it
was
very
unsatisfactory
it
was
desired
to
make
us
out
guilty
of
a
penitentiary
offence
at
the
least
and
for
that
purpose
recourse
was
had
to
an
old
forgotten
act
of
maryland
passed
in
the
year
the
fourth
section
of
which
provided
that
any
person
or
persons
who
after
the
said
tenth
day
of
september
shall
steal
any
ship
sloop
or
other
vessel
whatsoever
out
of
any
place
within
the
body
of
any
county
within
this
province
of
seventeen
feet
or
upwards
by
the
keel
and
shall
carry
the
same
ten
miles
or
upwards
from
the
place
whence
it
shall
be
stolen
who
shall
steal
any
negro
or
other
or
who
shall
counsel
hire
aid
abet
or
command
any
person
or
persons
to
commit
the
said
offences
or
who
shall
be
accessories
to
the
said
offences
and
shall
be
thereof
legally
convicted
as
aforesaid
or
outlawed
or
who
shall
obstinately
or
of
malice
stand
mute
or
peremptorily
challenge
above
twenty
shall
suffer
death
as
a
felon
or
felons
and
be
excluded
the
benefit
of
the
clergy
they
would
have
been
delighted
no
doubt
to
hang
us
under
this
act
but
that
they
could
not
do
as
congress
by
an
act
passed
in
having
changed
the
punishment
of
death
inflicted
by
the
old
maryland
statutes
except
in
certain
cases
specially
provided
for
into
confinement
in
the
penitentiary
for
not
less
than
twenty
years
to
make
sure
of
us
at
all
events
not
less
than
separate
indictments
that
being
the
number
of
the
pretended
owners
were
found
against
each
of
us
for
stealing
slaves
our
counsel
afterwards
made
some
complaint
of
this
great
number
of
indictments
when
two
against
each
of
us
including
all
the
separate
charges
in
different
counts
would
have
answered
as
well
it
was
even
suggested
that
the
fact
that
a
fee
of
ten
dollars
was
chargeable
upon
each
indictment
toward
the
salary
of
the
district
attorney
might
have
something
to
do
with
this
large
number
but
the
district
attorney
denied
very
strenuously
being
influenced
by
any
such
motive
maintaining
in
the
face
of
authorities
produced
against
him
that
this
great
number
was
necessary
he
thought
it
safest
i
suppose
instead
of
a
single
jury
on
each
charge
against
each
of
us
to
have
the
chance
of
a
much
greater
number
and
the
advantage
besides
of
repeated
opportunities
of
correcting
such
blunders
mistakes
and
neglects
as
the
prisoner
counsel
might
point
out
on
the
of
july
i
was
arraigned
in
the
criminal
court
judge
crawford
presiding
on
one
of
the
larceny
indictments
to
which
i
pleaded
not
guilty
whereupon
my
counsel
hall
and
mann
moved
the
court
for
a
continuance
till
the
next
term
alleging
the
prevailing
public
excitement
and
the
want
of
time
to
prepare
the
defence
and
to
procure
additional
counsel
but
the
judge
could
only
be
persuaded
and
that
with
difficulty
to
delay
the
trial
for
eighteen
days
when
this
unexpected
information
was
communicated
to
the
committee
at
boston
a
correspondence
was
opened
by
telegraph
with
seward
chase
and
fessenden
but
governor
seward
had
a
legal
engagement
at
baltimore
on
the
very
day
appointed
for
the
commencement
of
the
trial
and
the
other
two
gentlemen
had
indispensable
engagements
in
the
courts
of
ohio
and
maine
under
these
circumstances
as
hall
was
not
willing
to
take
the
responsibility
of
acting
as
counsel
in
the
case
and
as
it
seemed
necessary
to
have
some
one
familiar
with
the
local
practice
the
boston
committee
retained
the
services
of
carlisle
of
the
washington
bar
and
hildreth
again
proceeded
to
washington
to
give
his
assistance
just
as
the
trial
was
about
to
commence
carlisle
being
taken
sick
the
judge
was
with
great
difficulty
prevailed
upon
to
grant
a
further
delay
of
three
days
this
delay
was
very
warmly
opposed
not
only
by
the
district
attorney
but
by
the
same
radcliff
whom
we
have
seen
figuring
as
chairman
of
the
to
wait
on
bailey
and
who
had
been
retained
at
an
expense
of
two
hundred
dollars
by
the
friends
of
english
as
counsel
for
him
they
thinking
it
safest
not
to
have
his
defence
mixed
up
in
any
way
with
that
of
myself
and
sayres
before
the
three
days
were
out
governor
seward
having
finished
his
business
in
baltimore
hastened
to
washington
but
as
the
rules
of
the
court
did
not
allow
more
than
two
counsel
to
speak
on
one
side
the
other
counsel
being
also
fully
prepared
it
was
judged
best
to
proceed
as
had
been
arranged
the
trials
accordingly
commenced
on
thursday
the
of
july
upon
an
indictment
against
me
for
stealing
two
slaves
the
property
of
one
andrew
houver
the
district
attorney
in
opening
his
case
which
he
did
in
a
very
dogmatic
overbearing
and
violent
manner
declared
that
this
was
no
common
affair
the
rights
of
property
were
violated
by
every
larceny
but
this
case
was
peculiar
and
enormous
other
kinds
of
property
were
protected
by
their
want
of
intelligence
but
the
intelligence
of
this
kind
of
property
greatly
diminished
the
security
of
its
possession
the
jury
therefore
were
to
give
such
a
construction
to
the
laws
and
the
facts
as
to
subject
violators
of
it
to
the
most
serious
consequences
the
facts
which
seemed
to
be
relied
upon
by
the
district
attorney
as
establishing
the
alleged
larceny
were
that
i
had
come
to
washington
and
staid
from
monday
to
saturday
without
any
ostensible
business
when
i
had
sailed
away
with
slaves
on
board
concealed
under
the
hatches
and
the
hatches
battened
down
and
that
when
pursued
and
overtaken
the
slaves
were
found
on
board
with
provisions
enough
for
a
month
it
is
true
that
houver
swore
that
the
hatches
were
battened
down
when
the
pearl
was
overtaken
by
the
steamer
but
in
this
he
was
contradicted
by
every
other
government
witness
this
houver
was
according
to
some
of
the
other
witnesses
in
a
considerable
state
of
excitement
and
at
the
time
of
the
capture
he
addressed
some
violent
language
to
me
as
already
related
he
had
sold
his
two
boys
after
their
recapture
to
the
but
had
been
obliged
to
buy
them
back
again
at
a
loss
of
one
hundred
dollars
by
the
remonstrances
of
his
wife
who
did
not
like
to
part
with
them
as
they
had
been
raised
in
the
family
perhaps
this
circumstance
made
him
the
more
inveterate
against
me
as
to
the
schooner
being
provisioned
for
a
month
the
bill
of
the
provisions
on
board
purchased
in
washington
was
produced
on
the
trial
and
they
were
found
to
amount
to
three
bushels
of
meal
two
hundred
and
six
pounds
of
pork
and
fifteen
gallons
of
molasses
which
with
a
barrel
of
bread
purchased
in
alexandria
would
make
rather
a
short
month
supply
for
persons
it
was
also
proved
by
the
government
witnesses
that
the
pearl
was
a
mere
not
fit
to
go
to
sea
which
did
not
agree
very
well
with
the
idea
held
out
by
the
district
attorney
that
i
intended
to
run
these
negroes
off
to
the
west
indies
and
to
sell
them
there
but
to
make
up
for
these
deficiencies
williams
who
acted
as
the
leader
of
the
steamer
expedition
swore
that
i
had
said
while
on
board
that
if
i
had
got
off
with
the
negroes
i
should
have
made
an
independent
fortune
but
on
the
next
trial
he
could
not
say
whether
it
was
i
who
told
him
so
or
whether
somebody
else
told
him
that
i
had
said
so
orme
and
craig
with
whom
i
principally
conversed
and
who
went
into
long
details
recollected
nothing
of
the
sort
and
it
is
very
certain
that
as
there
was
no
foundation
for
it
and
no
motive
for
such
a
statement
on
my
part
i
never
made
it
williams
perhaps
had
heard
somebody
guess
that
if
i
had
got
off
i
had
slaves
enough
to
make
me
independent
and
that
guess
of
somebody
else
he
perhaps
remembered
or
seemed
to
remember
as
something
said
by
me
or
reported
to
have
been
said
by
me
and
such
often
in
cases
producing
great
public
excitement
is
the
sort
of
evidence
upon
which
men
lives
or
liberty
is
sworn
away
the
idea
however
of
an
intention
to
run
the
negroes
off
for
sale
seemed
principally
to
rest
on
the
testimony
of
a
certain
captain
baker
who
had
navigated
the
steamer
by
which
we
were
captured
at
the
mouth
of
the
potomac
and
who
saw
as
he
was
crossing
over
to
coan
river
for
wood
a
long
black
brig
with
her
sails
loose
lying
at
anchor
under
point
lookout
about
three
miles
from
our
vessel
this
was
proved
by
other
witnesses
to
be
a
very
common
place
of
anchorage
in
fact
that
it
was
common
for
vessels
waiting
for
the
wind
or
otherwise
to
anchor
anywhere
along
the
shores
of
the
bay
but
captain
baker
thought
otherwise
and
he
and
the
district
attorney
wished
the
jury
to
infer
that
this
brig
seen
by
him
under
point
lookout
was
a
piratical
craft
lying
ready
to
receive
the
negroes
on
board
and
to
carry
them
off
to
cuba
besides
houver
williams
orme
craig
and
baker
another
witness
was
called
to
testify
as
to
the
sale
of
the
wood
and
my
having
been
in
washington
the
previous
summer
many
questions
as
to
evidence
arose
and
the
examination
of
these
witnesses
consumed
about
two
days
and
a
half
in
opening
the
defence
mann
commenced
with
some
remarks
on
the
peculiarity
of
his
position
growing
out
of
the
unexpected
urgency
with
which
the
case
had
been
pushed
to
a
trial
and
the
public
excitement
which
had
been
produced
by
it
he
also
alluded
to
the
hardship
of
finding
against
me
such
a
multiplicity
of
indictments
for
what
individual
however
innocent
could
stand
up
against
such
an
accumulated
series
of
prosecutions
backed
by
all
the
force
of
the
nation
some
observations
on
the
costs
thus
unnecessarily
accumulated
and
in
particular
on
the
district
attorney
fees
produced
a
great
excitement
and
loud
denials
on
the
part
of
that
officer
mann
then
proceeded
to
remark
that
in
all
criminal
trials
which
he
had
ever
before
attended
or
heard
of
the
prosecuting
officer
had
stated
and
produced
to
the
jury
in
his
opening
the
law
alleged
to
be
violated
as
the
district
attorney
had
done
nothing
of
that
sort
he
must
endeavor
to
do
it
for
him
mann
then
proceeded
to
call
the
attention
of
the
jury
to
the
two
laws
already
quoted
upon
which
the
two
sets
of
indictments
were
founded
of
both
these
acts
charged
against
me
the
stealing
of
houver
slaves
and
the
helping
them
to
escape
from
their
master
i
could
not
be
guilty
the
real
question
in
this
case
was
which
had
i
done
to
make
the
act
stealing
there
must
have
been
so
mann
maintained
a
taking
as
the
lawyers
say
that
is
a
design
on
my
part
to
appropriate
these
slaves
to
my
own
use
as
my
own
property
if
the
object
was
merely
to
help
them
to
escape
to
a
free
state
then
the
case
plainly
came
under
the
other
statute
in
going
on
to
show
how
likely
it
was
that
the
persons
on
board
the
pearl
might
have
desired
and
sought
to
escape
independently
of
any
solicitations
or
suggestions
on
my
part
mann
alluded
to
the
meeting
in
honor
of
the
french
revolution
already
mentioned
held
the
very
night
of
the
arrival
of
the
pearl
at
washington
as
he
was
proceeding
to
read
certain
extracts
from
the
speech
of
senator
foote
on
that
occasion
already
quoted
and
well
calculated
as
he
suggested
to
put
ideas
of
freedom
and
emancipation
into
the
heads
of
the
slaves
he
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
judge
when
the
following
curious
dialogue
occurred
a
certain
latitude
is
to
be
allowed
to
counsel
in
this
case
but
i
can
not
permit
any
harangue
against
slavery
to
be
delivered
here
rising
suddenly
and
stepping
i
am
sure
your
honor
must
be
laboring
under
some
strange
misapprehension
born
and
bred
and
expecting
to
live
and
die
in
a
community
and
entertaining
no
ideas
different
from
those
which
commonly
prevail
here
i
have
watched
the
course
of
my
associate
argument
with
the
closest
attention
the
point
he
is
making
i
am
sure
is
most
pertinent
to
the
case
a
point
it
would
be
cowardice
in
the
prisoner
counsel
not
to
make
and
i
must
beg
your
honor
to
deliberate
well
before
you
undertake
to
stop
the
mouths
of
counsel
and
to
take
care
that
you
have
full
constitutional
warrant
for
doing
so
i
ca
permit
an
harangue
against
slavery
mann
proceeded
to
explain
the
point
at
which
he
was
aiming
he
had
read
these
extracts
from
foote
speech
delivered
to
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
blacks
and
whites
bond
and
free
assembled
before
the
office
as
showing
to
what
exciting
influences
the
slaves
of
the
district
were
exposed
independently
of
any
particular
pains
taken
by
anybody
to
make
them
discontented
and
with
the
same
object
in
view
he
proposed
to
read
some
further
extracts
from
other
speeches
delivered
on
the
same
occasion
if
this
matter
is
put
in
as
evidence
it
must
first
be
proved
that
such
speeches
were
delivered
if
the
authenticity
of
the
speeches
is
denied
i
will
call
the
honorable
foote
to
prove
it
what
newspaper
is
that
from
which
the
counsel
reads
it
the
washington
of
april
and
without
further
objection
he
proceeded
to
read
some
further
extracts
he
concluded
by
urging
upon
the
jury
that
this
case
was
to
be
viewed
merely
as
an
attempt
of
certain
slaves
to
escape
from
their
masters
and
on
my
part
an
attempt
to
assist
them
in
so
doing
and
therefore
a
case
under
the
statute
of
punishable
with
fine
and
not
a
larceny
as
charged
against
me
in
this
indictment
several
witnesses
were
called
who
had
known
me
in
philadelphia
to
testify
as
to
my
good
character
the
district
attorney
was
very
anxious
to
get
out
of
these
witnesses
whether
they
had
never
heard
me
spoken
of
as
a
man
likely
to
run
away
with
slaves
and
it
did
come
out
from
one
of
them
that
from
the
tenor
of
my
conversation
it
used
sometimes
to
be
talked
over
that
one
day
or
other
it
would
heave
up
that
i
had
helped
off
some
negro
to
a
free
state
but
these
conversations
the
witness
added
were
generally
in
a
jesting
tone
and
another
witness
stated
that
the
charge
of
running
off
slaves
was
a
common
joke
among
the
watermen
according
to
the
practice
in
the
maryland
criminal
courts
and
the
same
practice
prevails
in
the
district
of
columbia
the
judge
does
not
address
the
jury
at
all
after
the
evidence
is
all
in
the
counsel
before
arguing
the
case
may
call
upon
the
judge
to
give
to
the
jury
instructions
as
to
the
law
these
instructions
which
are
offered
in
writing
and
argued
by
the
counsel
the
judge
can
give
or
refuse
as
he
sees
fit
or
can
alter
them
to
suit
himself
but
any
such
refusal
or
alteration
furnishes
ground
for
a
bill
of
exceptions
on
which
the
case
if
a
verdict
is
given
against
the
prisoner
may
be
carried
by
writ
of
error
before
the
circuit
court
of
the
district
for
their
revisal
my
counsel
asked
of
the
judge
no
less
than
fourteen
instructions
on
different
points
of
law
ten
of
which
the
judge
refused
to
give
and
modified
to
suit
himself
several
of
these
related
to
the
true
definition
of
theft
or
what
it
was
that
makes
a
taking
larceny
it
was
contended
by
my
counsel
and
they
asked
the
judge
to
instruct
the
jury
that
to
convict
me
of
larceny
it
must
be
proved
that
the
taking
the
slaves
on
board
the
pearl
was
with
the
intent
to
convert
them
to
my
own
use
and
to
derive
a
gain
from
such
conversion
and
that
if
they
believed
that
the
slaves
were
received
on
board
with
the
design
to
help
them
to
escape
to
a
free
state
then
the
offence
was
not
larceny
but
a
violation
of
the
statute
of
this
instruction
variously
put
was
six
times
over
asked
of
the
judge
and
as
often
refused
he
was
no
less
anxious
than
the
district
attorney
to
convict
me
of
larceny
and
send
me
to
the
penitentiary
but
having
a
vast
deal
more
sense
than
the
district
attorney
he
saw
that
the
idea
that
i
had
carried
off
these
negroes
to
sell
them
again
for
my
own
profit
was
not
tenable
it
was
plain
enough
that
my
intention
was
to
help
them
to
escape
the
judge
therefore
who
did
not
lack
ingenuity
went
to
work
to
twist
the
law
so
as
if
possible
to
bring
my
case
within
it
even
he
did
not
venture
to
say
that
merely
to
assist
slaves
to
escape
was
stealing
stealing
he
admitted
must
be
a
taking
for
the
sake
of
gain
but
so
he
told
the
jury
in
one
of
his
instructions
this
desire
of
gain
need
not
be
to
convert
the
article
taken
to
his
the
taker
own
use
nor
to
obtain
for
the
thief
the
value
in
money
of
the
thing
stolen
if
the
act
was
prompted
by
a
desire
to
obtain
for
himself
or
another
even
other
than
the
owner
a
money
gain
or
any
other
inducing
advantage
a
dishonest
gain
then
the
act
was
a
larceny
and
in
another
instruction
he
told
the
jury
that
if
they
believed
from
the
evidence
that
the
prisoner
before
receiving
the
slaves
on
board
imbued
their
minds
with
discontent
persuaded
them
to
go
with
him
and
by
corrupt
influences
and
inducements
caused
them
to
come
to
his
ship
and
then
took
and
carried
them
down
the
river
then
the
act
was
a
larceny
upon
these
instructions
of
the
judge
to
which
bills
of
exceptions
were
filed
by
my
counsel
the
case
which
had
been
already
near
a
week
on
trial
was
argued
to
the
jury
the
district
attorney
had
the
opening
and
the
close
and
both
my
counsel
had
the
privilege
of
speaking
for
the
following
sketch
of
the
argument
as
well
as
of
the
legal
points
already
noted
i
am
indebted
to
the
notes
of
hildreth
taken
at
the
time
i
shall
endeavor
to
be
very
brief
in
the
opening
reserving
myself
till
i
know
the
grounds
of
defence
it
is
the
duty
of
the
jury
to
give
their
verdict
according
to
the
law
and
evidence
and
so
far
as
i
knew
public
opinion
there
neither
exists
now
nor
has
existed
at
any
other
time
the
slightest
desire
on
the
part
of
a
single
individual
that
the
prisoner
should
have
otherwise
than
a
fair
trial
i
think
therefore
the
solemn
warnings
by
the
prisoner
counsel
to
the
jury
were
wholly
uncalled
for
there
was
no
doubt
an
excitement
out
of
doors
a
natural
excitement
at
such
an
amount
of
property
snatched
up
at
one
fell
swoop
but
was
that
to
justify
the
suggestion
to
a
jury
of
twelve
honest
men
that
they
were
not
to
act
the
part
of
a
mob
the
learned
counsel
who
opened
the
case
for
the
prisoner
has
alluded
to
the
disadvantage
of
his
position
from
the
fact
that
he
was
a
stranger
i
acknowledge
that
disadvantage
and
i
have
attempted
to
remedy
it
and
so
has
the
court
by
extending
towards
him
every
possible
courtesy
the
prisoner
counsel
seems
to
think
i
press
this
matter
too
hard
but
am
i
to
sit
coolly
by
and
see
the
property
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
district
carried
off
and
when
the
felon
is
brought
into
court
not
do
my
best
to
secure
his
conviction
the
district
attorney
here
went
into
a
long
and
labored
defence
of
the
course
he
had
taken
in
preferring
against
the
prisoner
indictments
for
larceny
and
others
on
the
same
state
of
facts
for
transportation
he
denied
that
the
larcenies
of
the
property
of
different
individuals
could
be
included
in
one
indictment
and
declared
that
if
the
prisoner
counsel
would
show
the
slightest
authority
for
it
he
would
give
up
the
case
after
going
on
in
this
strain
for
an
hour
or
more
attacking
the
opposite
counsel
and
defending
himself
in
what
carlisle
pronounced
most
extraordinary
opening
argument
he
had
ever
heard
in
his
life
the
district
attorney
came
down
at
last
to
the
facts
of
the
case
in
what
position
is
the
prisoner
placed
by
the
evidence
how
is
he
introduced
to
the
jury
by
his
philadelphia
friends
these
witnesses
were
examined
as
to
his
character
and
the
substance
of
their
testimony
is
that
he
is
a
man
who
would
steal
a
negro
if
he
got
a
chance
he
passed
for
honest
otherwise
but
he
says
himself
he
would
steal
a
negro
to
liberate
him
and
the
court
says
it
makes
no
difference
whether
he
steals
to
liberate
or
steals
to
sell
being
caught
in
the
act
he
acknowledges
his
guilt
and
says
he
was
a
deserter
from
his
god
a
backslider
a
one
year
the
next
in
the
potomac
with
a
schooner
stealing
negroes
why
say
he
took
them
for
gain
if
he
did
not
steal
them
why
say
he
knew
he
should
end
his
days
in
a
penitentiary
why
say
if
he
got
off
with
the
negroes
he
should
have
realized
an
independent
fortune
did
he
not
know
they
were
slaves
he
chartered
the
vessel
to
carry
off
negroes
and
if
they
were
free
negroes
or
he
supposed
them
to
be
how
was
he
to
realize
an
independent
fortune
he
was
afraid
of
the
excitement
at
washington
why
so
if
the
negroes
were
not
slaves
there
was
the
fact
of
their
being
under
the
hatches
concealed
in
the
hold
of
the
vessel
did
not
that
prove
he
meant
to
steal
them
add
to
that
the
other
fact
of
his
leaving
at
night
he
comes
here
with
a
miserable
load
of
wood
gives
it
away
sells
it
for
a
note
did
not
care
about
the
wood
wanted
only
to
get
it
out
had
a
longing
for
a
cargo
of
negroes
the
wood
was
a
blind
besides
he
lied
about
it
would
he
have
ever
come
back
to
collect
his
note
but
the
counsel
says
the
slaves
might
have
heard
oration
and
so
have
been
persuaded
to
go
a
likely
story
they
all
started
off
i
suppose
ran
straight
down
to
the
vessel
and
got
into
the
hold
negroes
all
together
but
was
not
the
vessel
chartered
in
philadelphia
to
carry
off
negroes
this
shows
the
excessive
weakness
of
the
defence
and
how
did
the
slaves
behave
after
they
were
captured
if
they
had
been
running
away
would
they
not
have
been
downcast
and
disheartened
would
not
they
have
said
now
we
are
taken
on
the
other
hand
according
to
the
testimony
of
major
williams
on
their
way
back
they
were
laughing
shouting
and
eating
molasses
in
large
quantities
nero
fiddled
when
rome
was
burning
but
did
not
eat
molasses
what
a
transition
from
liberty
to
molasses
then
it
is
proved
that
the
bulkhead
between
the
cabin
and
the
hold
was
knocked
down
and
that
the
slaves
went
to
drayton
and
asked
if
they
should
fight
did
not
that
show
his
authority
over
them
that
the
slaves
were
under
his
control
and
that
he
was
the
it
speaks
volumes
here
followed
a
long
eulogy
on
the
gallantry
and
humanity
of
the
captors
one
man
did
threaten
a
little
but
he
was
drunk
the
substance
of
the
law
as
laid
down
by
the
judge
is
this
if
drayton
came
here
to
carry
off
these
people
and
by
machinations
prevailed
on
them
to
go
with
him
and
knew
they
were
slaves
it
makes
no
difference
whether
he
took
them
to
liberate
or
took
them
to
sell
if
he
was
to
be
paid
for
carrying
them
away
that
was
gain
enough
suppose
a
man
were
to
take
it
into
his
head
that
the
northern
factories
were
very
bad
things
for
the
health
of
the
and
were
to
go
with
a
schooner
for
the
purpose
of
liberating
those
poor
devils
by
stealing
the
spindles
would
not
he
be
served
as
this
prisoner
is
served
here
would
they
not
exhaust
the
to
find
the
severest
punishment
there
may
be
those
carried
so
far
by
a
miserable
mistaken
philanthropy
as
even
to
steal
slaves
for
the
sake
of
setting
them
at
liberty
but
this
prisoner
says
he
did
it
for
gain
we
might
look
upon
him
with
some
respect
if
in
a
manly
style
he
insisted
on
his
right
to
liberate
them
but
he
avowedly
steals
for
gain
he
lies
about
it
besides
even
a
jury
of
abolitionists
would
have
no
sympathy
for
such
a
man
try
him
anyhow
by
the
word
of
god
by
the
rules
of
common
honesty
he
would
be
convicted
anyhow
he
is
presented
to
the
world
at
large
as
a
rogue
and
a
common
thief
and
liar
there
can
be
no
other
conception
of
him
he
did
it
for
dishonest
gain
the
prisoner
must
be
convicted
he
can
not
escape
there
can
be
no
manner
of
doubt
as
to
his
guilt
i
am
at
a
loss
without
appearing
absurd
in
my
own
eyes
to
conceive
what
kind
of
a
defence
can
be
made
i
have
not
the
least
sort
of
feeling
against
the
wretch
himself
i
desire
a
conviction
from
principle
i
have
heard
doctrines
asserted
on
this
trial
that
strike
directly
at
the
rights
and
liberty
of
southern
citizens
i
have
heard
counsel
seeking
to
establish
principles
that
strike
directly
at
the
security
of
southern
property
i
feel
no
desire
that
this
man
as
a
man
should
be
convicted
but
i
do
desire
that
all
persons
inclined
to
infringe
on
our
rights
of
property
should
know
that
there
is
a
law
hero
to
punish
them
and
i
am
happy
that
the
law
has
been
so
clearly
laid
down
by
the
court
let
it
be
known
from
maine
to
texas
to
widest
limits
that
we
have
officers
and
juries
to
execute
that
law
no
matter
by
whom
it
may
be
violated
for
the
prisoner
regretted
to
occupy
any
more
of
the
jury
time
with
this
very
protracted
trial
i
mentioned
some
days
since
that
the
prisoner
was
liable
under
the
indictments
against
him
to
eight
hundred
years
imprisonment
a
term
hardly
to
be
served
out
by
methuselah
himself
but
apart
from
any
punishment
if
his
hundred
and
trials
are
to
proceed
at
this
rate
the
chance
is
he
will
die
without
ever
reaching
their
termination
the
district
attorney
has
dwelt
at
great
length
on
what
passed
the
other
day
and
more
than
once
he
has
pointedly
referred
to
me
in
a
tone
and
manner
not
to
be
mistaken
i
have
endeavored
to
conduct
this
trial
according
to
the
principles
of
law
and
to
that
standard
i
mean
to
come
up
my
client
though
a
prisoner
at
this
bar
has
rights
legal
social
human
and
upon
those
rights
i
mean
to
insist
this
is
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
ever
heard
a
prisoner
on
trial
and
before
conviction
denounced
as
a
liar
a
thief
a
felon
a
wretch
a
rogue
it
is
unjust
to
apply
these
terms
to
any
man
on
trial
the
law
presumes
him
to
be
innocent
the
feelings
of
the
prisoner
ought
not
to
be
thus
outraged
he
is
unfortunate
he
may
be
guilty
that
is
the
very
point
you
are
to
try
this
prisoner
is
charged
with
stealing
two
slaves
the
property
of
andrew
houver
did
he
or
not
that
point
you
are
to
try
by
the
law
and
the
evidence
because
you
may
esteem
this
a
peculiarly
valuable
kind
of
property
you
are
not
to
measure
out
in
this
case
a
peculiar
kind
of
justice
you
have
heard
the
evidence
the
law
for
the
purposes
of
this
trial
you
are
to
take
from
the
judge
but
you
are
not
to
be
led
away
with
the
idea
that
you
must
convict
this
prisoner
at
any
rate
it
is
a
principle
that
it
is
better
for
an
indefinite
number
of
guilty
men
to
escape
than
for
one
innocent
man
to
be
convicted
and
punished
and
for
the
best
of
reasons
for
to
have
the
very
machinery
established
for
the
protection
of
right
turned
into
an
instrument
for
the
infliction
of
wrong
strikes
a
more
fatal
blow
at
civil
society
than
any
number
of
unpunished
private
injuries
nor
is
there
any
danger
that
the
prisoner
will
escape
due
punishment
for
any
crimes
he
may
have
committed
besides
this
and
forty
other
larceny
indictments
hanging
over
his
head
there
are
transportation
indictments
against
him
now
he
can
not
be
guilty
of
both
and
which
of
these
offences
if
either
does
the
evidence
against
him
prove
who
is
this
man
look
at
him
you
see
he
has
passed
the
meridian
of
life
you
have
heard
about
him
from
his
neighbors
they
pronounce
him
a
fair
upright
moral
man
no
suspicion
hitherto
was
ever
breathed
against
his
honesty
he
was
a
professor
of
religion
and
so
far
as
we
know
had
walked
in
all
the
ordinances
and
commands
of
the
law
blameless
now
in
all
cases
of
doubt
a
fair
and
exemplary
character
especially
in
an
elderly
man
is
a
great
capital
to
begin
with
this
prisoner
may
have
been
mistaken
in
his
views
as
to
matters
of
human
right
but
as
to
violating
what
he
believed
to
be
duty
there
is
not
the
slightest
evidence
that
such
was
his
character
but
abundance
to
the
contrary
he
is
found
under
circumstances
that
make
him
amenable
to
the
law
let
him
be
tried
i
do
not
gainsay
that
but
let
him
have
the
common
sentiments
of
humanity
extended
toward
him
even
if
he
be
guilty
the
point
urged
against
him
with
such
earnestness
i
may
say
vehemence
is
not
that
he
took
the
slaves
merely
but
that
he
took
them
with
design
to
steal
his
confessions
are
dwelt
upon
stated
and
overstated
as
you
will
recollect
but
consider
under
what
circumstances
these
alleged
confessions
were
made
there
are
circumstances
which
make
such
statements
very
fallacious
consider
his
excitement
his
state
of
health
for
it
is
in
evidence
that
he
had
been
out
of
health
suffering
with
some
disorder
which
required
his
head
to
be
shaved
consider
the
armed
men
that
surrounded
him
and
the
imminent
peril
in
which
he
believed
his
life
to
be
it
is
great
injustice
to
brand
him
with
the
foul
epithet
of
liar
for
any
little
discrepancies
if
such
there
were
in
statements
made
under
such
circumstances
other
matters
have
been
forced
in
of
a
most
extraordinary
character
to
prejudice
his
case
in
your
eyes
it
has
been
suggested
the
idea
has
been
thrown
out
again
and
again
that
under
pretence
of
helping
them
to
freedom
he
meant
to
sell
these
negroes
this
suggestion
which
outruns
all
reason
and
discretion
is
founded
on
the
simple
fact
of
a
brig
seen
lying
at
anchor
in
a
place
of
common
anchorage
suggesting
no
suspicious
appearance
but
as
to
which
you
are
asked
to
infer
that
these
slaves
were
to
be
transported
into
her
and
carried
to
cuba
or
elsewhere
for
sale
what
a
monstrous
imagination
what
a
gross
libel
on
that
brig
her
officers
her
crew
her
owners
all
of
whom
are
thus
charged
as
kidnappers
and
pirates
and
all
this
baseless
dream
got
up
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
your
minds
against
the
prisoner
it
marks
indeed
with
many
other
things
the
style
in
which
this
prosecution
is
conducted
take
the
law
as
laid
down
by
the
court
and
it
is
necessary
for
the
government
to
prove
if
this
indictment
is
to
be
sustained
that
the
prisoner
corrupted
the
minds
of
houver
slaves
and
induced
and
persuaded
them
to
go
on
board
his
vessel
they
were
found
on
board
the
prisoner
vessel
no
doubt
but
as
to
how
they
came
there
we
have
not
a
particle
of
evidence
here
is
a
gap
a
fatal
gap
in
the
government
case
by
what
are
you
to
look
into
this
void
space
and
time
and
to
say
that
drayton
enticed
them
to
go
on
board
the
counsel
here
read
from
on
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
prosecution
are
bound
by
the
evidence
to
exclude
every
hypothesis
inconsistent
with
the
guilt
now
is
it
the
only
possible
means
of
accounting
for
the
presence
of
houver
slaves
on
board
to
suppose
that
this
prisoner
enticed
them
might
not
somebody
else
have
done
it
might
they
not
have
gone
without
being
enticed
at
all
we
wished
to
call
the
slaves
themselves
as
witnesses
but
the
law
shuts
up
their
mouths
can
you
without
any
evidence
say
that
drayton
enticed
them
and
that
by
no
other
means
could
they
come
onboard
presumptive
evidence
as
laid
down
in
the
book
an
acknowledged
and
unquestioned
authority
from
which
i
have
read
ought
to
be
equally
strong
with
the
evidence
of
one
unimpeached
witness
swearing
positively
to
the
fact
are
you
as
sure
that
drayton
enticed
those
slaves
as
if
that
fact
had
been
positively
sworn
to
by
one
witness
testifying
that
he
stood
by
and
saw
and
heard
it
if
you
are
not
then
under
the
law
as
laid
down
by
the
court
you
can
not
find
him
guilty
for
the
the
sun
under
which
we
draw
our
breath
the
soil
we
tottle
over
in
childhood
the
air
we
breathe
the
objects
that
earliest
attract
our
attention
the
whole
system
of
things
with
which
our
youth
is
surrounded
impress
firmly
upon
us
ideas
and
sentiments
which
cling
to
us
to
our
latest
breath
and
modify
all
our
views
i
trust
i
am
man
enough
always
to
remember
this
when
i
hear
opinions
expressed
and
views
maintained
by
men
educated
under
a
system
different
from
that
prevailing
here
no
matter
how
contrary
those
views
and
opinions
may
be
to
my
own
it
may
surprise
those
of
you
who
know
me
the
moral
atmosphere
in
which
i
have
grown
up
and
the
opinions
which
i
entertain
but
never
have
i
felt
so
deep
and
hearty
an
interest
in
the
defence
of
any
case
as
in
this
this
prisoner
i
never
saw
till
i
came
from
a
sick
bed
into
this
court
when
i
met
him
for
the
first
time
i
had
participated
strongly
in
the
feeling
which
in
connection
with
him
had
been
excited
in
this
community
as
you
well
know
i
have
and
could
have
no
sympathy
with
the
motives
by
which
he
may
be
presumed
to
have
been
actuated
why
then
this
sudden
feeling
in
his
behalf
not
i
assure
you
from
mercenary
motives
his
acquittal
or
his
condemnation
will
make
no
difference
in
the
compensation
i
receive
for
my
services
the
overpowering
interest
i
feel
in
this
case
originates
in
the
fact
that
it
places
at
stake
the
reputation
of
this
district
and
in
some
respects
of
the
country
itself
of
which
this
city
is
the
political
capital
the
counsel
for
the
government
has
dwelt
with
emphasis
on
the
great
amount
and
value
of
property
placed
at
hazard
by
this
prisoner
there
is
something
however
far
more
valuable
than
property
a
fair
honorable
impartial
administration
of
justice
and
of
the
chivalrous
race
of
the
south
it
may
be
expected
that
they
will
do
justice
though
the
heavens
fall
god
forbid
that
the
world
should
point
to
this
trial
as
a
proof
that
we
are
so
besotted
by
passion
and
interest
that
we
can
not
discern
the
most
obvious
distinctions
and
that
on
a
slave
question
with
a
jury
of
there
is
no
possible
chance
of
justice
many
i
assure
you
will
be
ready
to
fasten
this
charge
upon
us
it
is
my
hope
my
ardent
desire
it
is
your
sworn
duty
that
no
step
be
taken
against
this
prisoner
without
full
warrant
of
law
and
evidence
the
duty
of
defence
i
discharge
with
pleasure
i
could
have
desired
that
this
prisoner
might
have
been
defended
entirely
by
counsel
resident
in
this
district
it
would
have
been
my
pride
to
have
shown
to
the
world
that
of
our
own
mere
motion
we
would
do
justice
in
any
case
no
matter
how
delicate
no
matter
how
sore
the
point
the
prisoner
had
touched
my
learned
friend
the
district
attorney
has
alluded
to
the
courtesy
which
he
and
the
court
have
extended
to
my
associate
in
this
cause
i
hope
he
does
not
plume
himself
upon
that
a
gentleman
of
my
learning
ability
unexceptionable
deportment
and
high
character
among
his
own
people
must
and
will
be
treated
with
courtesy
wherever
he
goes
but
at
the
same
time
that
he
boasts
of
his
courtesy
the
district
attorney
takes
occasion
to
charge
my
associate
with
gross
ignorance
of
the
law
he
says
the
charges
could
not
have
been
included
in
one
indictment
and
offers
to
give
up
the
case
if
we
will
produce
a
single
authority
to
that
effect
it
were
easy
to
produce
the
authority
see
indictment
but
unfortunately
the
district
attorney
has
made
a
promise
which
he
ca
fulfil
the
district
attorney
is
mistaken
in
this
matter
at
the
same
time
let
me
admit
that
in
the
management
of
this
case
he
has
displayed
an
ability
beyond
his
years
this
is
the
first
prosecution
ever
brought
so
far
as
we
can
discover
on
this
statute
either
in
this
district
or
in
maryland
this
statute
of
the
existence
of
which
few
lawyers
were
aware
i
am
sure
i
was
not
has
been
waked
up
after
a
slumber
of
more
than
a
century
and
brought
to
bear
upon
my
client
it
is
your
duty
to
go
into
the
examination
of
this
novel
case
temperately
and
carefully
to
take
care
that
no
man
and
no
court
upon
review
of
the
case
shall
be
able
to
say
that
your
verdict
is
not
warranted
by
the
evidence
if
the
case
is
made
out
against
the
prisoner
convict
him
but
if
not
as
you
value
the
reputation
of
the
district
and
your
own
souls
beware
how
you
give
a
verdict
against
him
you
are
not
a
court
it
is
no
part
of
your
business
to
inquire
whether
the
prisoner
has
done
wrong
and
if
so
to
punish
him
for
it
it
is
your
sole
business
to
inquire
if
he
be
guilty
of
this
special
charge
set
forth
against
him
in
this
indictment
of
stealing
andrew
houver
two
slaves
the
law
you
are
not
expected
to
judge
of
to
enlighten
you
on
that
matter
we
have
prayed
instructions
from
the
court
and
those
instructions
for
the
purpose
of
this
trial
are
to
be
taken
as
the
law
the
question
for
you
is
does
the
evidence
in
this
case
bring
the
prisoner
within
the
law
as
laid
down
by
the
court
to
bring
him
within
that
law
you
are
not
to
go
upon
imagination
but
upon
facts
proved
by
witnesses
and
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
very
plain
duty
before
you
this
is
not
a
thing
done
in
a
corner
take
care
that
you
render
such
a
verdict
that
you
will
not
be
ashamed
to
have
it
set
forth
in
letters
of
light
visible
to
all
the
world
there
are
two
offences
established
by
the
statutes
of
maryland
between
which
in
this
case
it
becomes
your
duty
to
distinguish
everything
depends
on
these
statutes
because
without
these
statutes
neither
act
is
a
crime
at
common
law
there
are
no
such
offences
as
stealing
slaves
or
transporting
slaves
now
which
of
these
two
acts
is
proved
against
this
prisoner
in
some
respects
they
are
alike
the
carrying
the
slaves
away
the
depriving
the
master
of
their
services
is
common
to
both
but
to
constitute
the
stealing
of
slaves
according
to
the
law
as
laid
down
by
the
court
there
must
be
something
more
yet
there
must
be
a
corruption
of
the
minds
of
the
slaves
and
a
seducing
them
to
leave
their
masters
service
and
does
not
this
open
a
plain
path
for
this
prisoner
out
of
the
danger
of
this
prosecution
where
is
the
least
evidence
that
the
prisoner
seduced
these
slaves
and
induced
them
to
leave
their
masters
has
the
district
attorney
with
all
his
zeal
pointed
out
a
single
particle
of
evidence
of
that
sort
has
he
done
anything
to
take
this
case
out
of
the
transportation
statute
and
to
convert
it
into
a
case
of
stealing
he
has
to
be
sure
indulged
in
some
very
harsh
epithets
applied
to
this
prisoner
epithets
very
similar
to
those
which
lord
coke
indulged
in
on
the
trial
of
sir
walter
raleigh
and
which
drew
out
on
the
part
of
that
prisoner
a
memorable
retort
my
client
is
not
a
raleigh
but
neither
i
must
be
permitted
to
say
is
the
district
attorney
a
lord
coke
i
should
be
sorry
to
have
it
go
abroad
that
we
can
not
try
a
man
for
an
offence
of
this
sort
without
calling
him
a
liar
a
rogue
a
wretch
the
district
attorney
here
interrupted
with
a
good
deal
of
warmth
he
insisted
that
he
did
not
address
the
prisoner
but
the
jury
and
that
it
was
his
right
to
call
the
attention
of
the
jury
to
the
evidence
proving
the
prisoner
to
be
a
liar
rogue
and
wretch
i
do
not
dispute
the
learned
right
it
is
a
matter
of
taste
but
with
you
gentlemen
of
the
jury
these
harsh
epithets
are
not
to
make
the
difference
of
a
hair
you
are
to
look
at
the
evidence
and
where
is
the
evidence
that
the
prisoner
seduced
and
enticed
these
slaves
it
may
happen
to
any
man
to
have
a
runaway
slave
in
his
premises
and
even
in
his
employment
it
happened
to
me
to
have
in
my
employ
a
runaway
one
of
the
best
servants
by
the
way
i
ever
had
he
told
me
he
was
free
and
i
employed
him
as
such
if
i
had
happened
to
have
taken
him
to
baltimore
there
would
have
been
a
complete
similitude
to
the
case
at
bar
and
according
to
the
district
attorney
logic
i
might
have
been
indicted
for
stealing
because
i
had
him
with
me
i
am
to
be
presumed
to
have
enticed
him
from
his
master
as
to
the
particular
circumstances
under
which
he
came
into
my
employment
i
might
have
been
wholly
unable
to
show
them
is
it
not
possible
to
suppose
a
great
number
of
circumstances
under
which
these
slaves
of
houver
left
their
master
service
and
came
on
board
the
pearl
without
any
agency
on
the
part
of
this
prisoner
now
the
government
might
positively
disprove
and
exclude
forty
such
suppositions
but
so
long
as
one
remained
which
was
not
excluded
you
can
not
find
a
verdict
of
conviction
the
government
is
to
prove
that
the
prisoner
enticed
and
seduced
these
negroes
and
you
have
no
right
to
presume
he
did
so
unless
every
other
possible
explanation
of
the
case
is
positively
excluded
by
the
testimony
is
it
so
extravagant
a
supposition
that
foote
speech
and
the
other
speeches
heretofore
alluded
to
heard
by
these
slaves
or
communicated
to
them
might
have
so
wrought
upon
their
minds
as
to
induce
them
to
leave
their
masters
i
say
that
they
had
any
right
to
suppose
that
these
declamations
about
universal
emancipation
had
any
reference
to
them
i
am
a
southern
man
and
i
hold
to
the
southern
doctrine
i
admit
that
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
perfect
civil
liberty
and
holding
people
of
another
race
in
domestic
servitude
but
then
it
is
natural
that
these
people
should
overlook
this
distinction
however
obvious
and
important
nor
do
they
lack
wit
to
apply
these
speeches
to
their
own
case
or
interest
in
such
matters
i
myself
have
a
slave
as
quick
to
see
distinctions
as
i
am
and
who
would
have
made
a
better
lawyer
if
he
had
had
the
same
advantages
it
came
out
the
other
day
in
a
trial
in
this
court
that
the
colored
people
have
among
themselves
it
was
an
assault
and
battery
case
one
of
the
disputants
in
the
heat
of
the
argument
struck
the
other
but
then
they
have
precedents
for
that
in
the
house
of
representatives
is
it
an
impossible
or
improbable
or
a
disproved
supposition
that
a
number
of
slaves
having
agreed
together
to
desert
their
masters
or
having
concerted
such
a
plan
with
somebody
here
drayton
was
employed
to
come
and
take
them
away
and
that
he
received
them
on
board
without
ever
having
seen
one
of
them
if
his
confessions
are
to
be
taken
at
all
they
are
to
be
taken
together
and
do
they
not
tend
to
prove
such
a
state
of
facts
drayton
says
he
was
hired
to
come
here
that
he
was
to
be
paid
for
taking
them
away
does
that
look
as
if
he
seduced
them
the
counsel
here
commented
at
length
on
drayton
statements
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
they
tended
to
prove
nothing
more
than
a
transportation
for
hire
and
he
threw
no
little
ridicule
on
the
ship
which
the
district
attorney
had
conjured
up
in
his
opening
of
the
case
but
which
in
his
late
speech
he
had
wholly
overlooked
but
even
should
you
find
that
drayton
seduced
these
slaves
to
leave
their
masters
to
make
out
a
case
of
larceny
you
must
be
satisfied
that
he
took
them
into
his
possession
now
what
is
possession
of
a
slave
not
merely
being
in
company
with
him
if
i
ride
in
a
hack
i
am
not
in
possession
of
the
driver
possession
of
a
slave
is
dominion
and
control
and
where
is
the
slightest
evidence
that
this
prisoner
claimed
any
dominion
or
control
over
these
slaves
the
whole
question
in
this
case
is
were
these
slaves
stolen
or
were
they
running
away
with
the
prisoner
assistance
the
mere
fact
of
their
being
in
the
prisoner
company
throws
no
light
whatever
on
this
matter
the
great
point
however
in
this
case
is
this
by
the
judge
instructions
enticement
must
be
proved
shall
the
record
of
this
trial
go
forth
to
the
world
showing
that
you
have
found
a
fact
of
which
there
was
no
evidence
i
believe
in
my
conscience
there
is
a
gap
in
this
evidence
not
to
be
filled
up
except
by
passion
and
prejudice
if
that
is
so
i
hope
there
is
no
one
so
ungenerous
so
little
of
a
true
southerner
as
to
blame
me
for
my
zeal
in
this
case
or
not
to
rejoice
in
a
verdict
of
acquittal
it
is
bad
enough
that
strangers
should
have
got
up
a
mob
in
this
district
in
relation
to
this
matter
it
would
however
be
a
million
times
worse
if
juries
can
not
be
found
here
cool
and
dispassionate
enough
to
render
impartial
verdicts
i
hope
gentlemen
of
the
jury
you
will
rise
above
all
influence
make
yourselves
abolitionists
if
you
can
but
look
at
the
facts
of
the
case
and
looking
at
those
facts
is
it
necessary
for
me
to
open
my
lips
in
reply
in
a
case
like
this
sustained
by
such
direct
testimony
such
overwhelming
proof
i
defy
any
man
however
crazy
on
the
subject
of
slavery
unless
he
be
blinded
by
some
film
of
interest
to
hesitate
a
moment
as
to
his
conclusions
the
district
attorney
here
proceeded
at
great
length
and
with
a
great
air
of
offended
dignity
to
complain
of
having
been
schooled
and
advised
by
the
prisoner
counsel
and
to
justify
the
use
of
the
foul
epithets
he
had
bestowed
on
the
prisoner
this
is
not
a
place
for
parlor
talk
i
had
chosen
the
english
words
that
conveyed
my
meaning
most
distinctly
it
was
all
very
well
for
the
prisoner
counsel
to
smooth
things
over
but
was
i
instead
of
calling
him
a
liar
to
say
he
told
a
fib
when
i
call
him
a
thief
and
a
felon
do
i
go
beyond
the
charge
of
the
grand
jury
in
the
indictment
if
this
is
stepping
over
the
limits
of
propriety
in
all
similar
cases
i
shall
do
the
same
i
do
not
intend
to
blackguard
the
prisoner
i
do
not
delight
in
using
these
epithets
my
heart
is
not
locked
up
i
am
no
jack
ketch
prosecuting
criminals
for
ten
dollars
a
head
i
sympathize
with
the
wretches
brought
here
but
when
i
choose
to
call
them
by
their
proper
names
i
am
not
to
be
accused
of
bandying
epithets
the
district
attorney
then
proceeded
also
at
great
length
and
in
a
high
key
to
justify
his
hundred
and
indictments
against
the
prisoner
and
to
clear
himself
from
the
imputation
of
mercenary
motives
on
the
ground
that
the
business
of
the
year
independently
of
these
indictments
would
furnish
the
utmost
amount
to
which
he
was
entitled
he
next
referred
to
the
matter
of
the
brig
testified
to
by
captain
baker
which
had
been
made
the
occasion
of
much
ridicule
by
the
prisoner
counsel
part
of
the
evidence
which
he
had
relied
on
in
connection
with
the
brig
had
been
ruled
out
and
the
law
as
laid
down
by
the
court
according
to
which
taking
to
liberate
was
the
same
as
taking
to
steal
had
made
it
unnecessary
for
him
so
he
said
to
dwell
on
this
part
of
the
case
yet
he
now
proceeded
to
argue
at
great
length
from
the
testimony
in
the
case
that
there
must
have
been
a
connection
between
the
brig
and
the
schooner
that
as
the
schooner
was
confessedly
unseaworthy
and
could
not
have
gone
out
of
the
bay
it
must
have
been
the
intention
to
put
the
slaves
on
board
the
brig
and
to
carry
them
off
to
cuba
or
elsewhere
and
sell
them
the
testimony
to
this
effect
he
pronounced
conclusive
the
united
states
said
the
district
attorney
have
laid
before
you
the
clearest
possible
case
i
have
just
gone
through
a
pretty
long
term
of
this
court
i
see
several
familiar
faces
on
the
jury
and
i
rely
on
your
intelligence
in
fact
the
only
point
of
the
defence
is
that
the
united
states
have
offered
no
proof
that
drayton
seduced
and
enticed
these
slaves
to
come
on
board
the
pearl
and
that
the
prisoner
counsel
are
pleased
to
call
a
gap
a
chasm
which
they
say
you
fill
up
it
is
the
same
gap
which
occurs
in
every
larceny
case
where
can
the
government
produce
positive
testimony
to
the
taking
that
is
done
secretly
in
the
dark
and
is
to
be
presumed
from
circumstances
a
man
is
found
going
off
with
a
bag
of
chickens
your
chickens
are
you
going
to
presume
that
the
chickens
run
into
his
bag
of
their
own
accord
and
without
his
agency
a
man
is
found
riding
your
horse
are
you
to
presume
that
the
horse
came
to
him
of
its
own
accord
and
yet
horses
love
liberty
they
love
to
kick
up
their
heels
and
run
yet
this
would
be
just
as
sensible
as
to
suppose
that
these
slaves
came
on
board
drayton
vessel
without
his
direct
agency
he
came
here
from
philadelphia
for
them
they
are
found
on
board
his
vessel
drayton
says
he
would
steal
a
negro
if
he
could
is
not
that
enough
then
he
was
here
some
months
before
with
an
pretending
to
sell
oysters
he
pretended
that
he
came
for
his
health
likely
story
indeed
i
should
like
to
see
the
doctor
who
would
recommend
a
patient
to
come
here
in
the
fall
of
the
year
when
the
fever
and
ague
is
so
thick
in
the
marshes
that
you
can
cut
it
with
a
knife
cruising
about
eating
and
selling
oysters
at
that
time
of
the
year
for
his
health
nonsense
he
was
here
at
that
very
time
hatching
and
contriving
that
these
very
negroes
should
go
on
board
the
pearl
but
the
prisoner
counsel
say
he
might
have
been
employed
by
others
simply
to
carry
them
away
who
could
have
employed
him
but
abolitionists
and
did
he
not
say
he
had
no
sympathy
with
abolitionists
so
much
for
that
hypothesis
then
he
in
fact
pleads
guilty
he
says
he
expects
to
die
in
the
penitentiary
do
you
think
he
ought
to
if
there
is
any
chasm
here
the
prisoner
must
shed
light
upon
it
if
he
had
employers
who
were
they
the
prisoner
counsel
have
said
that
he
is
not
bound
to
tell
and
that
the
witnesses
if
summoned
here
would
not
be
compelled
to
criminate
themselves
but
shall
this
prisoner
be
allowed
to
take
advantage
of
his
own
wrong
as
to
the
metaphysics
of
the
prisoner
counsel
about
possession
that
is
easily
disposed
of
were
not
these
slaves
found
in
drayton
possession
and
did
he
admit
that
he
took
them
as
to
the
cautions
given
you
about
prejudice
and
passion
i
do
not
think
they
are
necessary
i
have
seen
no
sort
of
excitement
here
since
the
first
detection
of
this
affair
that
would
prevent
the
prisoner
having
a
fair
trial
is
there
any
crowd
or
excitement
here
the
community
will
be
satisfied
with
the
verdict
there
is
no
question
the
party
is
guilty
i
never
had
anything
to
do
with
a
case
sustained
by
stronger
evidence
i
ask
you
to
give
an
illegal
or
perjured
verdict
take
the
law
and
the
evidence
and
decide
upon
it
the
argument
being
now
concluded
and
the
jury
about
to
go
out
some
question
arose
whether
the
jury
should
have
the
written
instructions
of
the
court
with
them
and
some
inquiry
being
made
as
to
the
practice
one
of
the
jurors
observed
that
in
a
case
in
which
he
had
formerly
acted
as
juror
the
jury
had
the
instructions
with
them
and
he
proceeded
to
tell
a
funny
story
about
a
bottle
of
rum
told
by
one
of
the
jurors
on
that
occasion
which
story
caused
him
to
remember
the
fact
it
may
be
observed
by
the
way
that
the
proceedings
of
the
united
states
criminal
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
are
not
distinguished
for
any
remarkable
decorum
or
dignity
the
jury
in
this
case
were
in
constant
intercourse
during
any
little
intervals
in
the
trial
with
the
spectators
outside
the
bar
the
case
was
given
to
the
jury
about
three
and
the
court
after
waiting
half
an
hour
adjourned
when
the
court
met
at
ten
the
next
morning
the
jury
were
still
out
having
remained
together
all
night
without
being
able
to
agree
meanwhile
the
district
attorney
proceeded
to
try
me
on
another
indictment
for
stealing
three
slaves
the
property
of
one
william
upperman
as
this
trial
was
proceeding
about
two
the
jury
in
the
first
case
came
in
and
rendered
a
verdict
of
guilty
they
presented
rather
a
haggard
appearance
having
been
locked
up
for
hours
and
some
of
them
being
perhaps
a
little
troubled
in
their
consciences
the
jury
it
was
understood
had
been
divided
from
the
beginning
four
for
acquittal
and
eight
for
conviction
these
four
were
all
irishmen
and
perhaps
they
did
not
consider
it
consistent
with
their
personal
safety
and
business
interests
to
persist
in
disappointing
the
public
of
that
verdict
which
the
district
attorney
had
so
imperiously
demanded
the
agreement
it
was
understood
had
taken
place
only
a
few
moments
before
they
came
in
and
had
been
reached
entirely
on
the
strength
of
williams
testimony
to
my
having
said
that
had
i
got
off
i
should
have
made
an
independent
fortune
now
it
was
a
curious
coincidence
that
at
the
very
moment
that
this
agreement
was
thus
taking
place
williams
again
on
the
stand
as
a
witness
on
the
second
trial
wished
to
take
back
what
he
had
then
sworn
to
on
the
first
trial
stating
that
he
could
not
tell
whether
he
had
heard
me
say
this
or
whether
he
had
heard
of
my
having
said
it
from
somebody
else
after
the
rendition
of
the
verdict
of
the
other
jury
the
second
case
was
again
resumed
the
evidence
varied
in
only
a
few
particulars
from
that
which
had
been
given
in
the
first
case
there
was
in
addition
the
testimony
of
upperman
the
pretended
owner
of
the
woman
and
her
daughters
one
of
fifteen
the
other
nine
years
old
whom
i
was
charged
in
this
indictment
with
stealing
this
man
swore
with
no
less
alacrity
and
with
no
less
falsehood
than
houver
had
done
before
him
he
stated
that
about
ten
of
that
same
night
that
the
pearl
left
washington
while
he
was
fastening
up
his
house
he
saw
a
man
standing
on
the
opposite
his
door
and
observed
him
for
some
time
not
long
after
having
gone
to
bed
he
heard
a
noise
of
somebody
coming
down
stairs
and
calling
out
he
was
answered
by
his
who
was
just
then
going
off
though
he
had
no
suspicion
of
it
at
the
time
that
man
standing
on
the
he
pretended
to
recognize
as
me
he
was
perfectly
certain
of
it
beyond
all
doubt
and
question
the
object
of
this
testimony
was
to
lead
to
a
conclusion
of
enticement
or
persuasion
on
my
part
and
so
to
bring
the
case
within
one
of
the
instructions
already
stated
on
a
subsequent
trial
upperman
was
still
more
certain
if
possible
that
i
was
the
man
but
he
was
entirely
mistaken
in
saying
so
his
house
was
on
pennsylvania
avenue
more
than
a
mile
from
where
the
pearl
lay
and
i
was
not
within
a
mile
of
it
that
night
i
dare
say
upperman
was
sincere
enough
he
was
one
of
your
positive
sort
of
men
but
his
case
like
that
of
houver
shows
that
men
in
a
passion
will
sometimes
fall
into
blunders
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
after
the
trials
were
over
upperman
became
satisfied
of
his
error
the
first
trial
had
consumed
a
week
the
second
one
lasted
four
days
the
judge
laid
down
the
same
law
as
before
and
similar
exceptions
were
taken
by
my
counsel
the
jury
again
remained
out
all
night
being
long
divided
nine
for
conviction
to
three
for
acquittal
but
on
the
morning
of
august
they
came
in
with
a
verdict
of
guilty
satisfied
for
the
present
with
these
two
verdicts
against
me
the
district
attorney
now
proposed
to
pass
over
the
rest
of
my
cases
and
to
proceed
to
try
sayres
my
counsel
objected
that
having
been
forced
to
proceed
against
my
remonstrances
i
was
here
ready
for
trial
and
they
insisted
that
all
my
cases
should
be
now
disposed
of
they
did
not
prevail
however
and
the
district
attorney
proceeded
to
try
sayres
on
an
indictment
for
stealing
the
same
two
slaves
of
houver
in
addition
to
the
former
witnesses
against
me
english
was
now
put
upon
the
stand
the
district
attorney
having
first
entered
upon
the
hundred
and
fifteen
indictments
against
him
but
he
could
state
nothing
except
the
circumstances
of
his
connection
with
the
affair
and
the
coming
on
board
of
the
passengers
on
saturday
night
as
i
have
already
related
them
on
the
other
hand
the
phantom
brig
story
of
which
the
district
attorney
had
made
so
great
a
handle
in
the
two
cases
against
me
was
now
ruled
out
on
the
ground
that
the
brig
could
not
be
brought
into
the
case
till
some
connection
had
first
been
shown
between
her
and
the
pearl
the
trial
lasted
three
days
the
district
attorney
pressed
for
a
conviction
with
no
less
violence
than
he
had
done
in
my
case
assuring
the
jury
that
if
they
did
not
convict
there
was
an
end
of
the
security
of
slave
property
but
sayres
had
several
advantages
over
me
my
two
juries
had
been
citizens
of
washington
several
of
them
belonging
to
a
class
of
loafers
who
frequent
the
courts
for
the
sake
of
the
fees
to
be
got
as
jurymen
some
complaints
having
been
made
of
this
the
officers
had
been
sent
to
georgetown
and
the
country
districts
and
the
present
jury
was
drawn
from
those
quarters
then
again
i
was
regarded
as
the
main
culprit
the
only
one
in
the
secret
of
the
transaction
and
as
i
was
already
convicted
the
feeling
against
sayres
was
much
lessened
in
fact
the
jury
in
his
case
after
an
absence
of
half
an
hour
returned
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
the
district
attorney
greatly
surprised
and
vexed
proceeded
to
try
sayres
on
another
indictment
this
trial
lasted
three
days
and
a
half
but
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
district
attorney
who
was
more
positive
longer
and
louder
than
ever
the
jury
in
ten
minutes
returned
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
the
trials
had
now
continued
through
nearly
four
weeks
of
very
hot
weather
and
both
sides
were
pretty
well
worn
out
vexed
at
the
two
last
verdicts
the
district
attorney
threatened
to
give
up
sayres
on
a
requisition
from
virginia
which
was
said
to
have
been
lodged
for
us
some
of
the
alleged
slaves
belonging
there
and
we
having
been
there
shortly
before
finally
it
was
agreed
that
verdicts
should
be
taken
against
sayres
in
the
transportation
cases
he
to
have
the
advantage
of
carrying
the
points
of
law
before
the
circuit
court
and
the
remaining
larceny
indictments
against
him
to
be
discontinued
thus
ended
the
first
legal
campaign
english
was
discharged
altogether
without
trial
sayres
had
got
rid
of
the
charge
of
larceny
i
had
been
found
guilty
on
two
indictments
for
stealing
upon
which
judge
crawford
sentenced
me
to
twenty
years
imprisonment
in
the
penitentiary
while
sayres
on
indictments
for
assisting
the
escape
of
slaves
was
sentenced
to
a
fine
on
each
indictment
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
and
costs
amounting
altogether
to
seven
thousand
four
hundred
dollars
but
from
these
judgments
an
appeal
had
been
taken
to
the
circuit
court
and
meanwhile
sayres
and
i
remained
in
prison
as
before
the
hearing
before
the
circuit
court
came
on
the
of
november
that
court
consisted
of
cranch
an
able
and
upright
judge
but
very
old
and
infirm
and
judges
morrell
and
dunlap
the
latter
of
whom
claimed
to
be
the
owner
of
two
of
the
negroes
found
on
board
the
pearl
my
cases
were
argued
for
me
by
hildreth
carlisle
and
mann
the
district
attorney
who
was
much
better
fitted
to
bawl
to
a
jury
than
to
argue
before
a
court
had
retained
at
the
expense
of
the
united
states
the
assistance
of
bradley
one
of
the
ablest
lawyers
of
the
district
the
argument
consumed
not
less
than
three
days
many
points
were
discussed
but
that
on
which
the
cases
turned
was
the
definition
of
larceny
it
resulted
in
the
allowance
of
several
of
my
bills
of
exceptions
the
overturn
of
the
law
of
judge
crawford
on
the
subject
of
larceny
and
the
establishment
by
the
circuit
court
of
the
doctrine
on
that
subject
contended
for
by
my
counsel
but
from
this
opinion
judge
dunlap
dissented
the
case
of
sayres
for
want
of
time
was
postponed
till
the
next
term
a
new
trial
having
been
ordered
in
my
two
cases
everybody
supposed
that
the
charge
of
larceny
would
now
be
abandoned
as
the
circuit
court
had
taken
away
the
only
basis
on
which
it
could
possibly
rest
but
the
zeal
of
the
district
attorney
was
not
yet
satisfied
and
no
longer
trusting
to
his
own
unassisted
efforts
he
obtained
at
the
expense
of
the
united
states
the
assistance
of
richard
cox
an
old
and
very
unscrupulous
practitioner
with
whose
aid
he
tried
the
cases
over
again
in
the
criminal
court
the
two
trials
lasted
about
fourteen
days
i
was
again
defended
by
mann
and
carlisle
and
now
with
better
success
as
the
juries
under
the
instructions
which
judge
crawford
found
himself
obliged
to
give
and
notwithstanding
the
desperate
efforts
against
me
acquitted
me
in
both
cases
almost
without
leaving
their
seats
finally
the
district
attorney
agreed
to
abandon
the
remaining
larceny
cases
if
we
would
consent
to
verdicts
in
the
transportation
cases
on
the
same
terms
with
those
in
the
case
of
sayres
this
was
done
when
judge
crawford
had
the
satisfaction
of
sentencing
me
to
fines
and
costs
amounting
together
to
ten
thousand
and
sixty
dollars
and
to
remain
in
prison
until
that
amount
was
paid
there
was
still
a
further
hearing
before
the
circuit
court
on
the
bills
of
exceptions
to
these
transportation
indictments
my
counsel
thought
they
had
some
good
legal
objections
but
the
hearing
unfortunately
came
on
when
judge
cranch
was
absent
from
the
bench
and
the
other
two
judges
overruled
them
by
a
strange
construction
of
the
laws
no
criminal
case
except
by
accident
can
be
carried
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
otherwise
the
cases
against
us
would
have
been
taken
there
including
the
question
of
the
legality
of
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
thus
after
a
severe
and
expensive
struggle
i
was
saved
from
the
penitentiary
but
sayres
and
myself
remained
in
the
washington
jail
loaded
with
enormous
fines
which
from
our
total
inability
to
pay
them
would
keep
us
there
for
life
unless
the
president
could
be
induced
to
pardon
us
and
it
was
even
questioned
as
i
shall
show
presently
whether
he
had
any
such
power
the
jail
of
the
district
of
columbia
is
under
the
charge
of
the
marshal
of
the
district
that
office
when
i
was
first
committed
to
prison
was
filled
by
a
hunter
but
he
was
sick
at
the
time
and
died
soon
after
when
robert
wallace
was
appointed
this
wallace
was
a
virginian
from
the
neighbor
hood
of
alexandria
son
of
a
doctor
wallace
from
whom
he
had
inherited
a
large
property
including
many
slaves
he
had
removed
to
tennessee
and
had
set
up
there
but
failing
in
that
business
had
returned
back
with
the
small
remnants
of
his
property
and
polk
provided
for
him
by
making
him
marshal
it
was
not
long
before
i
found
that
he
had
a
great
spite
against
me
it
was
in
vain
that
i
solicited
from
him
the
use
of
the
passage
the
light
which
came
into
my
cell
was
very
faint
and
i
could
only
read
by
sitting
on
the
floor
with
my
back
against
the
grating
of
the
cell
door
but
so
far
from
aiding
me
to
read
and
it
was
the
only
method
i
had
of
passing
my
time
wallace
made
repeated
and
vexatious
attempts
to
keep
me
from
receiving
newspapers
i
should
very
soon
have
died
on
the
prison
allowance
the
marshal
is
allowed
by
the
united
states
cents
per
day
for
feeding
the
prisoners
for
this
money
they
receive
two
meals
breakfast
consisting
of
one
herring
and
a
dish
of
molasses
and
water
very
slightly
flavored
with
coffee
and
for
dinner
again
with
half
a
pound
of
the
meanest
sort
of
salted
beef
and
a
soup
made
of
stirred
into
the
this
is
the
bill
of
fare
day
after
day
all
the
year
round
and
as
at
the
utmost
such
food
can
not
cost
more
than
eight
or
nine
cents
a
day
for
each
prisoner
and
as
the
average
number
is
fifty
the
marshal
must
make
a
handsome
profit
the
diet
has
been
fixed
i
suppose
after
the
model
of
the
slave
allowances
but
congress
after
providing
the
means
of
feeding
the
prisoners
in
a
decent
manner
ought
not
to
allow
them
to
be
starved
for
the
benefit
of
the
marshal
such
was
the
diet
to
which
i
was
confined
in
the
first
days
of
my
imprisonment
but
i
soon
contrived
to
make
a
friend
of
jake
the
old
black
cook
of
the
prison
who
i
could
see
as
he
came
in
to
pour
out
my
coffee
evinced
a
certain
sympathy
and
respect
for
me
through
his
agency
i
was
able
to
purchase
some
more
eatable
food
and
indeed
the
surgeon
of
the
jail
allowed
me
flour
under
the
name
of
medicine
it
being
impossible
as
he
said
for
me
to
live
on
the
prison
diet
wallace
soon
after
he
came
into
office
finding
a
small
sum
in
my
possession
of
about
forty
dollars
took
it
from
me
he
expressed
a
fear
that
i
might
corrupt
old
jake
or
somebody
else
especially
as
he
found
that
i
gave
jake
my
old
newspapers
and
so
escape
from
the
prison
but
he
left
the
money
in
the
hands
of
the
jailer
and
allowed
me
to
draw
it
out
a
dollar
at
a
time
he
presently
turned
out
old
jake
and
put
in
a
of
his
own
as
cook
but
she
was
better
disposed
towards
me
than
her
master
and
i
found
no
difficulty
in
purchasing
with
my
own
money
and
getting
her
to
prepare
such
food
as
i
wanted
i
was
able
too
after
some
six
or
eight
weeks
sleeping
on
the
stone
floor
of
my
cell
to
obtain
some
improvement
in
that
particular
and
not
for
myself
only
but
for
all
the
other
prisoners
also
the
jailer
was
requested
by
several
persons
who
came
to
see
us
to
procure
mattresses
for
us
at
their
expense
and
finally
wallace
as
if
out
of
pure
shame
procured
a
quantity
of
husk
mattresses
for
the
use
of
the
prisoners
generally
still
we
had
no
cots
and
were
obliged
to
spread
our
mattresses
on
the
floor
the
allowance
of
clothing
made
to
the
prisoners
who
were
confined
without
any
means
of
supporting
themselves
corresponded
pretty
well
with
the
jail
allowance
of
provisions
they
received
shirts
one
at
a
time
made
of
the
very
meanest
kind
of
cotton
cloth
and
of
the
very
smallest
dimensions
trousers
of
about
equal
quality
and
shoes
it
was
said
that
the
united
states
paid
also
for
jackets
and
caps
how
that
was
i
do
not
know
but
the
prisoners
never
received
any
the
custody
of
the
jail
was
intrusted
to
a
head
jailer
assisted
by
four
guards
or
turnkeys
one
of
whom
acted
also
as
of
the
personal
treatment
toward
me
of
those
in
office
at
the
time
i
was
first
committed
i
have
no
complaint
to
make
the
rigor
of
my
confinement
was
indeed
great
but
i
am
happy
to
say
that
it
was
not
aggravated
by
any
disposition
on
the
part
of
these
men
to
triumph
over
me
or
to
trample
upon
me
as
they
grew
more
acquainted
with
me
they
showed
their
sense
that
i
was
not
an
ordinary
criminal
and
treated
me
with
many
marks
of
consideration
and
even
of
regard
and
in
one
of
them
i
found
a
true
friend
shortly
after
wallace
came
into
office
he
made
several
changes
he
was
full
of
caprices
and
easily
took
offence
from
very
small
causes
and
of
this
the
keepers
as
well
as
the
prisoners
had
abundant
experience
the
head
jailer
did
his
best
to
please
behaving
in
the
most
humble
and
submissive
manner
but
all
to
no
purpose
he
was
discharged
as
were
also
the
others
one
after
another
wallace
undertaking
to
act
as
head
jailer
himself
of
wallace
vexatious
conduct
towards
me
of
his
refusal
to
allow
me
to
receive
newspapers
prohibiting
the
under
jailer
to
lend
me
even
the
baltimore
of
his
accusation
against
me
of
bribing
old
jake
whom
he
forbade
the
turnkeys
to
allow
to
come
near
me
of
his
keeping
me
shut
up
in
my
cell
and
generally
of
a
bitter
spirit
of
angry
malice
against
me
i
had
abundant
reason
to
complain
during
the
weary
fifteen
months
or
more
that
i
remained
under
his
power
but
his
subordinates
though
obliged
to
obey
his
orders
and
to
comply
with
his
humors
were
far
from
being
influenced
by
his
feelings
even
his
favorite
among
the
turnkeys
a
person
who
pretty
faithfully
copied
his
conduct
towards
the
other
prisoners
always
behaved
very
kindly
towards
me
and
even
used
to
make
a
confidant
of
me
by
coming
to
my
cell
to
talk
over
his
troubles
but
the
person
whose
kind
offices
and
friendly
sympathy
did
far
more
than
those
of
any
other
to
relieve
the
tediousness
of
my
confinement
and
to
keep
my
heart
from
sinking
was
wood
there
is
no
chaplain
at
the
washington
jail
nor
has
congress
so
far
as
i
am
aware
made
any
provision
of
any
kind
for
the
spiritual
wants
or
the
moral
and
religious
instruction
of
the
inmates
of
it
this
great
deficiency
wood
a
man
of
a
great
heart
though
of
very
limited
pecuniary
means
being
then
a
clerk
in
the
telegraph
office
had
taken
it
upon
himself
to
supply
so
far
as
he
could
and
for
that
purpose
he
was
in
the
habit
of
visiting
the
prison
on
sundays
conversing
with
the
prisoners
and
furnishing
tracts
and
books
to
such
as
were
able
and
disposed
to
read
he
came
to
my
cell
or
to
the
grating
of
the
passage
in
which
i
was
confined
on
the
very
first
sunday
of
my
imprisonment
and
he
readily
promised
at
my
request
to
furnish
me
with
a
bible
though
in
that
act
of
kindness
he
was
anticipated
by
the
colored
woman
of
whom
i
have
already
made
mention
who
appeared
at
my
cell
with
a
bible
for
me
just
after
wood
had
left
it
the
kindness
of
wood
heart
and
the
sincerity
of
his
sympathy
was
so
apparent
as
to
secure
him
the
affectionate
respect
of
all
the
prisoners
to
me
he
proved
a
very
considerate
and
useful
friend
not
only
was
i
greatly
indebted
to
his
assistance
in
making
known
my
necessities
and
those
of
my
family
to
those
disposed
to
relieve
them
but
his
cheerful
and
christian
conversation
served
to
brighten
many
a
dark
hour
and
to
dispel
many
gloomy
feelings
were
all
professing
christians
like
my
friend
wood
we
should
not
hear
so
many
denunciations
as
we
now
do
of
the
church
and
complaints
of
her
there
was
another
person
also
whose
kind
attentions
to
me
i
ought
not
to
overlook
this
was
susannah
ford
a
very
respectable
colored
woman
who
sold
refreshments
in
the
lobby
of
the
and
who
in
the
progress
of
the
trial
had
evinced
a
good
deal
of
interest
in
the
case
as
she
often
had
boarders
in
the
jail
who
like
me
could
not
live
on
the
jail
fare
and
whom
she
supplied
she
was
frequently
there
and
she
seldom
came
without
bringing
with
her
some
substantial
token
of
her
regard
sayres
and
myself
had
looked
forward
to
the
change
of
administration
which
resulted
from
the
election
of
general
taylor
with
considerable
hopes
of
advantage
from
it
but
for
a
considerable
time
this
advantage
was
limited
to
a
change
in
the
marshal
in
whose
custody
we
were
the
turning
out
of
wallace
gave
great
satisfaction
to
everybody
in
the
jail
or
connected
with
it
except
the
turnkeys
who
held
office
by
his
appointment
and
who
expected
that
his
dismissal
would
be
followed
by
their
own
the
very
day
before
the
appointment
of
his
successor
came
out
i
had
been
remonstrating
with
him
against
the
cruelty
of
refusing
me
the
use
of
the
passage
and
i
had
even
ventured
to
hint
that
i
hoped
he
would
do
nothing
which
he
would
be
ashamed
to
see
spoken
of
in
the
public
prints
to
which
he
replied
g
d
d
n
the
public
prints
in
that
cell
you
will
stay
but
in
this
he
proved
not
much
of
a
prophet
the
next
day
as
soon
as
the
news
of
his
dismissal
reached
the
jail
the
turnkeys
at
once
unlocked
my
and
admitted
me
into
the
passage
observing
that
the
new
marshal
when
he
came
to
take
possession
should
at
least
find
me
there
this
new
marshal
was
robert
wallach
a
native
of
the
district
very
similar
in
name
to
his
predecessor
but
very
different
in
nature
and
from
the
time
that
he
entered
into
office
the
extreme
rigor
hitherto
exercised
to
me
was
a
good
deal
abated
one
thing
however
i
had
to
regret
in
the
change
which
was
the
turning
out
of
all
the
old
guards
with
whom
i
was
already
well
acquainted
and
the
appointment
of
a
new
set
one
of
these
thus
turned
out
the
person
to
whom
i
have
already
referred
to
as
the
chief
favorite
of
the
late
marshal
made
a
desperate
effort
to
retain
his
office
but
although
he
solicited
and
obtained
certificates
to
the
effect
that
he
was
and
always
had
been
a
good
whig
he
had
to
walk
out
with
the
others
the
new
jailer
appointed
by
wallach
and
three
of
the
new
guards
or
turnkeys
were
very
gentlemanly
persons
and
neither
i
nor
the
other
prisoners
had
any
reason
to
complain
of
the
change
of
the
fourth
turnkey
i
can
not
say
as
much
he
was
violent
overbearing
and
tyrannical
and
he
was
frequently
guilty
of
conduct
towards
the
prisoners
which
made
him
very
unfit
to
serve
under
such
a
marshal
and
ought
to
have
caused
his
speedy
removal
but
unfortunately
the
marshal
was
under
some
political
obligations
to
him
which
made
the
turning
him
out
not
so
easy
a
matter
this
person
seemed
to
have
inherited
all
the
feelings
of
hatred
and
dislike
which
the
late
marshal
had
entertained
towards
me
and
he
did
his
best
to
annoy
me
in
a
variety
of
ways
though
of
course
his
power
was
limited
by
his
subordinate
position
but
although
i
gained
considerably
by
the
of
things
i
soon
found
that
it
had
also
some
annoying
consequences
under
the
old
marshal
either
to
make
the
imprisonment
more
disagreeable
to
me
or
from
fear
lest
i
should
corrupt
the
other
prisoners
i
had
been
kept
in
a
sort
of
solitary
confinement
no
other
prisoners
being
placed
in
the
same
passage
this
system
was
now
altered
and
although
my
privacy
was
always
so
far
respected
that
i
was
allowed
a
cell
by
myself
i
often
found
myself
with
in
the
same
passage
from
whose
society
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
derive
either
edification
or
pleasure
i
suffered
a
good
deal
from
this
cause
but
at
length
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
remedy
or
at
least
a
partial
one
i
was
allowed
during
the
the
range
of
the
debtors
apartments
a
suite
of
spacious
airy
and
comfortable
rooms
in
which
there
were
seldom
more
than
one
or
two
tenants
i
pleaded
hard
to
be
removed
to
these
apartments
altogether
to
be
allowed
to
sleep
there
as
well
as
to
pass
the
days
there
as
it
was
merely
for
the
of
a
sum
of
money
that
i
was
held
i
thought
i
had
a
right
to
be
treated
as
a
debtor
but
those
apartments
were
so
insecure
that
the
keepers
did
not
care
to
trust
me
there
during
the
night
by
this
change
of
quarters
my
condition
was
a
good
deal
improved
i
not
only
had
ample
conveniences
for
reading
but
i
improved
the
opportunity
to
learn
to
write
having
only
been
able
to
sign
my
name
when
t
was
committed
to
the
prison
but
a
jail
after
all
is
a
jail
and
i
longed
and
sighed
to
obtain
my
liberty
and
to
enjoy
again
the
society
of
my
wife
and
children
had
it
been
wished
to
impress
my
mind
in
the
strongest
manner
with
the
horrors
of
slavery
no
better
method
could
have
been
devised
than
this
imprisonment
in
the
washington
jail
i
felt
personally
what
it
was
to
be
restrained
of
my
liberty
and
as
many
of
the
prisoners
were
runaway
slaves
or
slaves
committed
at
the
request
of
their
masters
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
what
slaves
are
exposed
to
of
this
i
shall
here
give
but
a
single
instance
wallace
the
marshal
as
i
have
already
mentioned
had
two
female
slaves
the
last
remnants
of
the
large
which
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
one
of
these
was
a
young
and
very
comely
mulatto
girl
whom
wallace
had
made
his
housekeeper
and
whom
he
sought
to
make
also
his
concubine
but
as
the
girl
already
had
a
child
by
a
young
white
man
to
whom
she
was
attached
she
steadily
repelled
all
his
advances
not
succeeding
by
persuasion
this
scion
of
the
aristocracy
of
the
old
dominion
this
virginian
gentleman
and
marshal
of
the
united
states
for
the
district
of
columbia
shut
the
girl
up
in
the
jail
of
the
district
in
hopes
of
thus
breaking
her
to
his
will
and
as
she
proved
obstinate
he
finally
sold
her
he
then
turned
his
eyes
on
the
other
woman
his
property
jemima
our
cook
already
the
mother
of
three
children
but
she
set
him
at
open
defiance
as
she
wished
to
be
sold
he
had
lost
the
greatest
means
of
controlling
her
and
as
she
openly
threatened
before
all
the
keepers
to
tear
every
rag
of
clothing
off
his
body
if
he
dared
lay
his
hand
upon
her
he
did
not
venture
to
brave
her
fury
in
most
of
the
states
if
not
in
all
of
them
certainly
in
all
the
free
states
there
is
no
such
thing
as
keeping
a
man
in
prison
for
life
merely
for
the
of
a
fine
which
he
has
no
means
to
pay
the
same
spirit
of
humanity
which
has
abolished
the
imprisonment
of
poor
debtors
at
the
caprice
of
their
creditors
has
provided
means
for
discharging
after
a
short
imprisonment
persons
held
in
prison
for
fines
which
they
have
no
means
of
paying
indeed
what
can
be
more
unequal
or
unjust
than
to
hold
a
poor
man
a
prisoner
for
life
for
an
offence
which
a
rich
man
is
allowed
to
expiate
by
a
small
part
of
his
superfluous
wealth
but
this
is
one
among
many
other
barbarisms
which
the
existence
of
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
by
preventing
any
systematic
revision
of
the
laws
has
entailed
upon
the
capital
of
our
model
democracy
there
was
as
i
have
stated
no
means
by
which
sayres
and
myself
could
be
discharged
from
prison
except
by
paying
our
fines
which
was
totally
out
of
the
question
or
by
obtaining
a
presidential
pardon
which
for
a
long
time
seemed
equally
hopeless
there
was
indeed
a
peculiarity
about
our
case
such
as
might
afford
a
plausible
excuse
for
not
extending
to
us
any
relief
under
the
law
of
the
sums
imposed
upon
us
as
fines
were
to
go
one
half
to
the
owners
of
the
slaves
and
the
other
half
to
the
district
and
it
was
alleged
that
although
the
president
might
remit
the
latter
half
he
could
not
the
other
that
same
radcliff
whom
i
have
already
had
occasion
to
mention
volunteered
his
services
for
a
consideration
to
get
over
this
difficulty
in
consequence
of
a
handsome
fee
which
he
received
he
undertook
to
obtain
the
consent
of
the
owners
of
the
slaves
to
our
discharge
but
having
pocketed
the
money
he
made
so
far
as
i
could
find
very
little
progress
in
the
business
not
having
secured
above
five
or
six
signers
in
answer
to
my
repeated
applications
he
at
length
proposed
that
my
wife
and
youngest
daughter
should
come
on
to
washington
to
do
the
business
which
he
had
undertaken
and
for
which
he
had
secured
a
handsome
payment
in
advance
they
came
on
accordingly
and
by
personal
application
succeeded
in
obtaining
in
all
the
signatures
of
out
of
the
whole
number
the
reception
which
they
met
with
from
different
parties
was
very
different
showing
that
there
is
among
as
much
variety
of
character
as
among
other
people
some
signed
with
alacrity
saying
that
as
no
slaves
had
been
lost
i
had
been
kept
in
jail
too
long
already
others
required
much
urging
others
positively
refused
some
even
added
insults
young
francis
dodge
of
georgetown
would
not
sign
though
my
life
had
depended
upon
it
one
wanted
me
hung
and
another
tarred
and
feathered
one
pious
lying
on
his
as
he
supposed
was
persuaded
to
sign
but
he
afterwards
drew
back
and
nothing
could
prevail
on
him
to
put
his
name
to
the
paper
die
or
live
he
wholly
refused
but
the
most
curious
case
occurred
at
alexandria
to
which
place
my
wife
went
to
obtain
the
signature
of
a
pious
old
lady
who
had
been
the
claimant
of
a
youngster
found
among
the
passengers
of
the
pearl
and
who
had
been
sold
in
consequence
for
the
southern
market
the
old
lady
it
appeared
was
still
the
owner
of
the
mother
who
acted
as
one
of
her
domestics
and
if
she
was
willing
the
old
lady
professed
her
readiness
to
sign
the
black
woman
was
accordingly
called
in
and
the
nature
of
my
wife
application
stated
to
her
but
with
much
positiveness
and
indignation
she
refused
to
give
her
consent
declaring
that
my
wife
could
as
well
do
without
her
husband
as
she
could
do
without
her
boy
so
imbruted
and
stupefied
by
slavery
was
this
old
woman
that
she
seemed
to
think
the
selling
her
boy
away
from
her
a
perfectly
humane
christian
and
proper
act
while
all
her
indignation
was
turned
against
me
who
had
merely
afforded
the
boy
an
opportunity
of
securing
his
freedom
i
dare
say
they
had
persuaded
the
old
woman
that
i
had
enticed
the
boy
to
run
away
whereas
as
i
have
already
stated
i
had
never
seen
him
nor
any
other
of
the
passengers
till
i
found
them
on
board
as
only
signers
could
be
obtained
the
matter
stood
very
much
as
it
did
before
the
attempt
was
made
so
long
as
president
fillmore
remained
a
candidate
for
reëlection
there
was
little
ground
to
expect
from
him
a
favorable
consideration
of
my
case
i
therefore
felt
sincerely
thankful
to
the
whig
convention
when
they
passed
by
fillmore
and
gave
the
nomination
to
general
scott
fillmore
being
thus
placed
in
a
position
which
enabled
him
to
listen
to
the
dictates
of
reason
justice
and
humanity
my
hopes
and
those
of
my
friends
were
greatly
raised
sumner
the
free
democratic
senator
from
massachusetts
had
visited
me
in
prison
shortly
after
his
arrival
at
washington
and
had
evinced
from
the
beginning
a
sincere
and
active
sympathy
for
me
some
complaints
were
made
against
him
in
some
papers
because
he
did
not
present
to
the
senate
some
petitions
in
my
behalf
which
had
been
forwarded
to
his
care
but
sumner
was
of
opinion
and
i
entirely
agreed
with
him
that
if
the
object
was
to
obtain
my
discharge
from
prison
that
object
was
to
be
accomplished
not
by
agitating
the
matter
in
the
senate
but
by
private
appeals
to
the
equity
and
the
conscience
of
the
president
nor
did
he
think
nor
i
either
that
my
interests
ought
to
be
sacrificed
for
the
opportunity
to
make
an
speech
there
is
reason
in
everything
and
i
thought
and
he
thought
too
that
i
had
been
made
enough
of
a
martyr
of
already
the
case
having
been
brought
to
the
notice
of
the
president
he
being
no
longer
a
candidate
for
reëlection
could
not
fail
to
recognize
the
claim
of
sayres
and
myself
to
a
discharge
we
had
already
been
kept
in
jail
upwards
of
four
years
for
an
offence
which
the
laws
had
intended
to
punish
by
a
trifling
pecuniary
fine
nor
was
this
all
the
earlier
part
of
our
confinement
had
been
exceedingly
rigorous
and
it
had
only
been
by
the
untiring
efforts
of
our
friends
and
at
a
great
expense
to
them
that
we
had
been
saved
from
falling
victims
to
the
conspiracy
between
the
district
attorney
and
judge
crawford
to
send
us
to
the
penitentiary
although
my
able
and
indefatigable
counsel
mann
whose
arduous
labors
and
efforts
in
my
behalf
i
shall
never
forget
and
still
less
his
friendly
counsels
and
kind
personal
attentions
had
received
nothing
except
i
believe
the
partial
reimbursement
of
his
travelling
expenses
and
although
there
was
much
other
service
gratuitously
rendered
in
our
cases
yet
it
had
been
necessary
to
pay
pretty
roundly
for
the
services
of
carlisle
and
altogether
the
expenditures
which
had
been
incurred
to
shield
us
from
the
effects
of
the
conspiracy
above
mentioned
far
exceeded
any
amount
of
fine
which
might
have
been
reasonably
imposed
under
the
indictments
upon
which
we
had
been
found
guilty
was
not
the
enormous
sum
which
judge
crawford
sentenced
us
to
pay
a
gross
violation
of
the
provision
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
against
excessive
fines
any
fine
utterly
beyond
a
man
ability
to
pay
and
which
operates
to
keep
him
a
prisoner
for
life
must
be
excessive
or
else
that
word
has
no
meaning
but
though
our
case
was
a
strong
one
there
still
remained
a
serious
obstacle
in
the
way
in
the
idea
that
because
half
the
fines
was
to
go
to
the
owners
of
the
slaves
the
president
could
not
remit
that
half
here
was
a
point
upon
which
sumner
was
able
to
assist
us
much
more
effectually
than
by
making
speeches
in
the
senate
it
was
a
point
too
involved
in
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
for
there
were
some
english
cases
which
denied
the
power
of
pardon
under
such
circumstances
sumner
found
however
by
a
laborious
examination
of
the
american
cases
that
a
different
view
had
been
taken
in
this
country
and
he
drew
up
and
submitted
to
the
president
an
elaborate
legal
opinion
in
which
the
right
of
the
executive
to
pardon
us
was
very
clearly
made
out
this
opinion
the
president
referred
to
the
attorney
general
a
considerable
time
elapsed
before
he
found
leisure
to
examine
it
but
at
last
it
obtained
his
sanction
also
information
at
length
reached
us
the
matter
having
been
pending
for
two
months
or
more
that
the
president
had
signed
our
pardon
it
had
yet
however
to
pass
through
the
office
of
the
secretary
for
the
interior
and
meanwhile
we
were
not
by
any
means
free
from
anxiety
the
reader
will
perhaps
recollect
that
among
the
other
things
which
the
district
attorney
had
held
over
our
heads
had
been
the
threat
to
surrender
us
up
to
the
authorities
of
virginia
on
a
requisition
which
it
was
alleged
they
had
made
for
us
the
story
of
this
requisition
had
been
repeated
from
time
to
time
and
a
circumstance
now
occurred
which
in
seeming
to
threaten
us
with
something
of
the
sort
served
to
revive
all
our
apprehensions
stuart
the
secretary
of
the
interior
through
whose
office
the
pardon
was
to
pass
sent
word
to
the
marshal
that
such
a
pardon
had
been
signed
and
at
the
same
time
requested
him
if
it
came
that
day
into
his
hands
not
to
act
upon
it
till
the
next
as
this
stuart
was
a
virginian
out
apprehensions
were
naturally
excited
of
some
movement
from
that
quarter
the
pardon
arrived
about
five
that
afternoon
and
immediately
upon
receiving
it
the
marshal
told
us
that
he
had
no
longer
any
hold
upon
us
that
we
were
free
men
and
at
liberty
to
go
where
we
chose
as
we
were
preparing
to
leave
the
jail
i
observed
that
a
gentleman
a
friend
of
the
marshal
whom
i
had
often
seen
there
and
who
had
always
treated
me
with
great
courtesy
hardly
returned
my
and
looked
at
me
as
black
as
a
afterwards
upon
inquiring
of
the
jailer
what
the
reason
could
be
i
learned
that
this
gentleman
who
was
a
good
deal
of
a
politician
was
greatly
alarmed
and
disturbed
lest
the
act
of
the
president
in
having
pardoned
us
should
result
in
the
defeat
of
the
whig
party
and
though
willing
enough
that
we
should
be
released
he
did
not
like
to
have
it
done
at
the
expense
of
his
party
and
his
own
hopes
of
obtaining
some
good
office
the
whigs
were
defeated
sure
enough
but
whether
because
we
were
pardoned
though
the
idea
is
sufficiently
nattering
to
my
vanity
is
more
than
i
shall
venture
to
decide
the
black
prisoners
in
the
jail
having
nothing
to
hope
or
fear
from
the
rise
or
fall
of
parties
yielded
freely
to
their
friendly
feelings
and
greeted
our
departure
with
three
cheers
we
left
the
jail
as
privately
as
possible
and
proceeded
in
a
carriage
to
the
house
of
a
gentleman
of
the
district
where
we
were
entertained
at
supper
our
imprisonment
had
lasted
four
years
and
four
months
lacking
seven
days
we
did
not
feel
safe
however
with
that
virginia
requisition
hanging
over
our
heads
so
long
as
we
remained
in
the
district
or
anywhere
on
ground
and
by
the
liberality
of
our
friends
a
hack
was
procured
for
us
to
carry
us
that
same
night
to
baltimore
there
the
next
morning
to
take
the
cars
for
philadelphia
the
night
proved
one
of
the
darkest
and
stormiest
which
it
had
ever
been
my
fate
to
encounter
and
i
have
seen
some
bad
weather
in
my
time
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
and
the
road
was
only
now
and
then
visible
by
the
flashes
of
the
lightning
but
our
trusty
driver
persevered
and
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
brought
us
to
baltimore
by
the
early
dawn
sayres
proceeded
by
the
direct
route
to
philadelphia
having
still
some
apprehensions
of
pursuit
and
a
requisition
i
took
the
route
by
harrisburg
great
was
the
satisfaction
which
i
felt
as
the
cars
crossed
the
line
from
maryland
into
pennsylvania
it
was
like
escaping
out
of
algiers
into
a
free
and
christian
country
i
shall
leave
it
to
the
reader
to
imagine
the
meeting
between
myself
and
my
family
they
had
received
notice
of
my
coming
and
were
all
waiting
to
receive
me
if
a
man
wishes
to
realize
the
agony
which
our
american
inflicts
in
the
separation
of
families
let
him
personally
feel
that
separation
as
i
did
let
him
pass
four
years
in
the
washington
jail
when
committed
to
the
prison
i
was
by
no
means
well
i
had
been
a
good
deal
out
of
health
as
appeared
from
the
evidence
on
the
trial
for
two
or
three
years
before
close
confinement
or
indeed
confinement
of
any
sort
does
not
agree
with
persons
of
my
temperament
and
i
came
out
of
the
prison
a
good
deal
older
and
much
more
of
an
invalid
than
when
i
entered
it
the
reader
perhaps
will
inquire
what
good
was
gained
by
all
these
sufferings
of
myself
and
my
family
what
satisfaction
i
can
have
as
it
did
not
succeed
in
looking
back
to
an
enterprise
attended
with
so
much
risk
and
which
involved
me
in
so
long
and
tedious
an
imprisonment
the
satisfaction
that
i
have
is
this
what
i
did
and
what
i
attempted
to
do
was
my
protest
a
protest
which
resounded
from
one
end
of
the
union
to
the
other
and
which
i
hope
by
the
dissemination
of
this
my
narrative
to
renew
and
repeat
it
it
was
my
protest
against
the
infamous
and
atrocious
doctrine
that
there
can
be
any
such
thing
as
property
in
man
we
can
only
do
according
to
our
power
and
the
capacity
gifts
and
talents
that
we
have
others
more
fortunate
than
i
may
record
their
protest
against
this
wicked
doctrine
more
safely
and
comfortably
for
themselves
than
i
did
they
may
embody
it
in
burning
words
and
eloquent
speeches
they
may
write
it
out
in
books
they
may
preach
it
in
sermons
i
could
not
do
that
i
have
as
many
thoughts
as
another
but
for
want
of
education
i
lack
the
power
to
express
them
in
speech
or
writing
i
have
not
been
able
to
put
even
this
short
narrative
on
paper
without
obtaining
the
assistance
of
a
friend
i
could
not
talk
i
could
not
write
but
i
could
act
the
humblest
the
most
uneducated
man
can
do
that
i
did
act
and
by
my
actions
i
protested
that
i
did
not
believe
that
there
was
or
could
be
any
such
thing
as
a
right
of
property
in
human
beings
nobody
in
this
country
will
admit
for
a
moment
that
there
can
be
any
such
thing
as
property
in
a
white
man
the
institution
of
slavery
could
not
last
for
a
day
if
the
slaves
were
all
white
but
i
do
not
see
that
because
their
complexions
are
different
they
are
any
the
less
men
on
that
account
the
doctrine
i
hold
to
and
which
i
desired
to
preach
in
a
practical
way
is
the
doctrine
of
jefferson
and
madison
that
there
can
not
be
property
in
man
no
not
even
in
black
men
and
the
rage
exerted
against
me
on
the
part
of
the
grew
entirely
out
of
my
preaching
that
doctrine
actions
as
everybody
knows
speak
louder
than
words
by
virtue
of
my
actions
proclaiming
my
opinion
on
that
subject
i
became
at
once
powerless
as
i
otherwise
was
elevated
in
the
minds
of
the
to
the
same
high
level
with
giddings
and
hale
who
they
could
not
help
believing
must
have
been
my
secret
confederates
if
i
had
believed
as
the
do
that
men
can
be
owned
if
i
had
really
attempted
as
they
falsely
and
meanly
charged
me
with
doing
to
steal
had
i
actually
sought
to
appropriate
men
as
property
to
my
own
use
had
that
been
all
does
anybody
imagine
that
i
should
ever
have
been
pursued
with
such
persevering
enmity
and
personal
virulence
do
they
get
up
a
debate
in
congress
and
a
riot
in
the
city
of
washington
every
time
a
theft
is
committed
or
attempted
in
the
district
it
was
purely
because
i
was
not
a
thief
because
in
helping
men
women
and
children
claimed
as
chattels
to
escape
i
bore
my
testimony
against
robbing
human
beings
of
their
liberty
this
was
the
very
thing
that
excited
the
against
me
just
as
a
strong
speech
excites
them
against
hale
or
giddings
or
mann
or
stunner
those
gentlemen
have
words
at
command
they
can
speak
and
can
do
good
service
by
doing
so
as
for
me
it
was
impossible
that
i
should
ever
be
able
to
make
myself
heard
in
congress
or
by
the
nation
at
large
except
in
the
way
of
action
the
opportunity
occurring
i
did
not
hesitate
to
improve
it
nor
have
i
ever
yet
seen
occasion
to
regret
having
done
so
