introduction
the
accompanying
atlas
has
been
included
in
this
series
for
the
greater
convenience
of
the
reader
of
grote
greece
and
other
works
that
ask
a
continual
reference
to
maps
of
ancient
and
classical
geography
the
disadvantage
of
having
to
turn
perpetually
from
the
text
of
a
volume
to
a
map
at
its
end
or
a
few
pages
away
is
often
enough
to
prevent
the
effective
use
of
the
one
in
elucidating
the
other
despite
some
slight
variations
of
spelling
in
the
classical
used
by
different
authors
there
need
be
no
difficulty
in
adapting
the
same
atlas
to
various
works
whether
they
are
english
versions
of
historians
like
herodotus
or
livy
or
english
histories
of
the
ancient
world
such
as
grote
and
gibbon
taking
the
case
of
grote
he
preferred
as
we
know
the
use
of
the
k
in
greek
names
to
the
usual
equivalent
c
and
he
retained
other
special
forms
of
certain
words
a
comparative
list
of
a
few
typical
names
which
appear
both
in
the
index
to
his
history
of
greece
in
this
series
and
in
the
index
to
the
present
atlas
will
show
that
the
variation
between
the
two
is
regular
and
fairly
uniform
and
easy
to
remember

the
reader
will
need
no

the

to

it
is
not

when

simpler

gains
equally
by
having
a

its

is
somewhat
less
than

but
as
to
the
exact
limits
of
greece
proper
he
points
out
that
these
limits
seem
not
to
have
been
very
precisely
defined
even
among

the

before

the
country

was
not
considered
as
a
part
of
italy
it
had
been
occupied
by
a
powerful
colony
of
gauls
who
settling
themselves
along
the
banks
of
the
po
from
piedmont
to
romagna
carried
their
arms
and
diffused
their
name

the
venetians
the
middle
part
of
the
peninsula
that
now
composes
the
duchy
of
tuscany
and
the
ecclesiastical

the
ancient

of
the

we
may
remark
that

the
little
province
of

annexed

seat

sovereignty

advantage

being
the
result
of
the
successive
labour
of
many
hands
its
original
author
was
samuel

sometime
of
shrewsbury
school
and
afterwards
bishop
of
lichfield
and
coventry
he
edited
aeschylus
and
was
in
his
way
a
famous
geographer
the
work
was
at
a
later
date
twice
revised
and
its
maps
were
under
the
editorship
of
his
son
it
has
now
been
again
revised
