philadelphia
ice
creams
comprising
the
first
group
are
very
palatable
but
expensive
in
many
parts
of
the
country
it
is
quite
difficult
to
get
good
cream
for
that
reason
i
have
given
a
group
of
creams
using
part
milk
and
part
cream
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
it
takes
smart
juggling
to
make
ice
cream
from
milk
by
far
better
use
condensed
milk
with
enough
water
or
milk
to
rinse
out
the
cans
ordinary
fruit
creams
may
be
made
with
condensed
milk
at
a
cost
of
about
fifteen
cents
a
quart
which
of
course
is
cheaper
than
ordinary
milk
and
cream
in
places
where
neither
cream
nor
condensed
milk
can
be
purchased
a
fair
ice
cream
is
made
by
adding
two
tablespoonfuls
of
olive
oil
to
each
quart
of
milk
the
cream
for
philadelphia
ice
cream
should
be
rather
rich
but
not
double
cream
if
pure
raw
cream
is
stirred
rapidly
it
swells
and
becomes
frothy
like
the
beaten
whites
of
eggs
and
is
whipped
cream
to
prevent
this
in
making
philadelphia
ice
cream
the
cream
is
scalded
and
when
it
is
cold
the
remaining
half
of
raw
cream
is
added
this
gives
the
smooth
light
and
rich
consistency
which
makes
these
creams
so
different
from
others
use
of
fruits
use
fresh
fruits
in
the
summer
and
the
best
canned
unsweetened
fruits
in
the
winter
if
sweetened
fruits
must
be
used
cut
down
the
given
quantity
of
sugar
where
acid
fruits
are
used
they
should
be
added
to
the
cream
after
it
is
partly
frozen
time
for
freezing
the
time
for
freezing
varies
according
to
the
quality
of
cream
or
milk
or
water
water
ices
require
a
longer
time
than
ice
creams
it
is
not
well
to
freeze
the
mixtures
too
rapidly
they
are
apt
to
be
coarse
not
smooth
and
if
they
are
churned
before
the
mixture
is
icy
cold
they
will
be
greasy
or
buttery
the
average
time
for
freezing
two
quarts
of
cream
should
be
ten
minutes
it
takes
but
a
minute
or
two
longer
for
larger
quantities
directions
for
freezing
pound
the
ice
in
a
large
bag
with
a
mallet
or
use
an
ordinary
ice
shaver
the
finer
the
ice
the
less
time
it
takes
to
freeze
the
cream
a
four
quart
freezer
will
require
ten
pounds
of
ice
and
a
quart
and
a
pint
of
coarse
rock
salt
you
may
pack
the
freezer
with
a
layer
of
ice
three
inches
thick
then
a
layer
of
salt
one
inch
thick
or
mix
the
ice
and
salt
in
the
tub
and
shovel
it
around
the
freezer
before
beginning
to
pack
the
freezer
turn
the
crank
to
see
that
all
the
machinery
is
in
working
order
then
open
the
can
and
turn
in
the
mixture
that
is
to
be
frozen
turn
the
crank
slowly
and
steadily
until
the
mixture
begins
to
freeze
then
more
rapidly
until
it
is
completely
frozen
if
the
freezer
is
properly
packed
it
will
take
fifteen
minutes
to
freeze
the
mixture
philadelphia
ice
creams
are
not
good
if
frozen
too
quickly
to
repack
after
the
cream
is
frozen
wipe
off
the
lid
of
the
can
and
remove
the
crank
take
off
the
lid
being
very
careful
not
to
allow
any
salt
to
fall
into
the
can
remove
the
dasher
and
scrape
it
off
take
a
large
knife
or
steel
spatula
scrape
the
cream
from
the
sides
of
the
can
work
and
pack
it
down
until
it
is
perfectly
smooth
put
the
lid
back
on
the
can
and
put
a
cork
in
the
hole
from
which
the
dasher
was
taken
draw
off
the
water
repack
and
cover
the
whole
with
a
piece
of
brown
paper
throw
over
a
heavy
bag
or
a
bit
of
burlap
and
stand
aside
for
one
or
two
hours
to
ripen
to
mold
ice
creams
ices
or
puddings
if
you
wish
to
pack
ice
cream
and
serve
it
in
forms
or
shapes
it
must
be
molded
after
the
freezing
the
handiest
of
all
of
these
molds
is
either
the
brick
or
the
melon
mold
after
the
cream
is
frozen
rather
stiff
prepare
a
tub
or
bucket
of
coarsely
chopped
ice
with
less
salt
than
you
use
for
freezing
to
each
ten
pounds
of
ice
allow
one
quart
of
rock
salt
sprinkle
a
little
rock
salt
in
the
bottom
of
your
bucket
or
tub
then
put
over
a
layer
of
cracked
ice
another
layer
of
salt
and
cracked
ice
and
on
this
stand
your
mold
which
is
not
filled
but
is
covered
with
a
lid
and
pack
it
all
around
leaving
the
top
of
course
to
pack
later
on
take
your
freezer
near
this
tub
remove
the
lid
from
the
mold
and
pack
in
the
cream
smoothing
it
down
until
you
have
filled
it
to
overflowing
smooth
the
top
with
a
spatula
or
limber
knife
put
over
a
sheet
of
waxed
paper
and
adjust
the
lid
have
a
strip
of
muslin
or
cheese
cloth
dipped
in
hot
paraffin
or
suet
and
quickly
bind
the
seam
of
the
lid
this
will
remove
all
danger
of
salt
water
entering
the
pudding
now
cover
the
mold
thoroughly
with
ice
and
salt
make
sure
that
your
packing
tub
or
bucket
has
a
hole
below
the
top
of
the
mold
so
that
the
salt
water
will
be
drained
off
if
you
are
packing
in
small
molds
each
mold
as
fast
as
it
is
closed
should
be
wrapped
in
wax
paper
and
put
down
into
the
salt
and
ice
these
must
be
filled
quickly
and
packed
molds
should
stand
two
hours
and
may
stand
longer
to
remove
ice
creams
ices
and
puddings
from
molds
ice
cream
may
be
molded
in
the
freezer
you
will
then
have
a
perfectly
round
smooth
mold
which
serves
very
well
for
puddings
that
are
to
be
garnished
and
saves
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
extra
expense
for
salt
and
ice
as
cold
water
is
warmer
than
the
ordinary
freezing
mixture
after
you
lift
the
can
or
mold
wipe
off
the
salt
hold
it
for
a
minute
under
the
cold
water
spigot
then
quickly
wipe
the
top
and
bottom
and
remove
the
lid
loosen
the
pudding
with
a
limber
knife
hold
the
mold
a
little
slanting
give
it
a
shake
and
nine
times
out
of
ten
it
will
come
out
quickly
having
the
perfect
shape
of
the
can
or
mold
if
the
cream
still
sticks
and
refuses
to
come
out
wipe
the
mold
with
a
towel
wrung
from
warm
water
hot
water
spoils
the
gloss
of
puddings
and
unless
you
know
exactly
how
to
use
it
the
cream
is
too
much
melted
to
garnish
all
frozen
puddings

refreshments
for
affairs
in
arranging
this
matter
i
have
made
an
earnest
effort
to
be
of
service
to
the
housewife
without
or
with
one
maid
as
well
as
to
those
who
are
fortunate
enough
to
have
trained
help
it
is
perhaps
unnecessary
to
say
that
elaborate
refreshments
are
entirely
out
of
place
at
small
afternoon
or
evening
cards
an
ice
with
a
wafer
or
cake
and
coffee
served
on
card
tables
are
sufficient
a
salad
with
bread
and
butter
sandwiches
and
coffee
or
a
salad
sandwich
with
coffee
make
a
nice
combination
hot
dishes
even
light
entr√©es
seem
to
call
for
a
dessert
or
another
course
and
coffee
for
wedding
and
other
large
receptions
serve
a
greater
variety
of
dishes
jellied
meats
boned
chicken
salads
sandwiches
ices
cakes
and
coffee
in
winter
creamed
dishes
may
be
served
in
paper
cases
on
the
same
plate
with
salads
and
other
cold
dishes
serve
coffee
in
small
cups
after
refreshments
many
so
called
elaborate
dishes
are
quite
easily
made
and
entr√©es
are
frequently
quite
as
good
when
rewarmed
chicken
croquettes
may
be
made
and
fried
early
in
the
day
ready
to
rewarm
on
brown
paper
in
a
baking
pan
in
a
hot
oven
ten
minutes
before
serving
time
sandwiches
will
keep
perfectly
well
for
several
hours
if
wrapped
in
a
damp
towel
and
closed
in
a
tin
bread
box
salad
sandwiches
are
better
however
if
made
as
near
serving
time
as
possible
if
a
large
reception
is
to
be
given
even
with
good
help
prepare
as
many
dishes
as
possible
the
day
before
to
avoid
confusion
on
the
fixed
day
refreshments
for
small
affairs
need
not
necessarily
cost
much
time
or
money
a
half
cupful
of
chopped
steak
a
couple
of
chops
or
a
bit
of
chicken
or
a
box
of
sardines
make
a
good
foundation
for
molds
of
tomato
jelly
served
with
bread
and
butter
sandwiches
and
coffee
they
are
quite
sufficient
for
afternoon
or
evening
cards
many
of
the
ices
in
this
book
are
new
and
attractive
the
new
sorbets
are
liked
by
those
who
are
always
striving
for
a
change
many
are
old
and
reliable
at
large
affairs
serve
from
the
dining
table
at
card
parties
large
and
small
serve
on
the
card
tables
using
a
small
tea
cloth
on
each
table
at
afternoon
teas
serve
from
the
tea
table
in
the
drawing
room
at
lawn
parties
serve
from
a
large
table
on

small
tables
may
be
placed
here
and
there
for
the
convenience
of
guests
every
day
afternoon
tea
may
be
served
in
the
summer
on
the
porch
in
the
winter
in
the
living
room
or
library
if
two
dishes
only
are
served
be
sure
that
they
harmonize
with
each
other
and
with
the
manner
of
service
suitable
and
hygienic
combinations
are
always
to
be
considered
but
the
√¶sthetic
side
seems
to
me
of
equal
importance
coffee
for
large
home
affairs
allow
eleven
ounces
of
finely
ground
coffee
to
each
gallon
of
water
this
will
serve
twenty
five
persons
with
one
coffee
cup
each
and
forty
persons
with
cups
the
better
way
to
make
a
large
quantity
of
coffee
without
an
urn
is
to
purchase
a
new
wash
boiler
wash
it
and
put
in
the
required
quantity
of
water
cold
weigh
the
coffee
and
divide
it

in

cheese

bag
tie

put
