daily
and

from
all
parts
of
the
world
i
receive
publications
bearing
upon
the
practical
applications
of
electricity
this
great
movement
the
ultimate
outcome
of
which
is
not
to
be
foreseen
had
its
origin
in
the
discoveries
made
by
michael
faraday
years
ago
from
these
discoveries
have
sprung
applications
of
the
telephone
order
together
with
various
forms
of
the
electric
telegraph
from
them
have
sprung
the
extraordinary
advances
made
in
electrical
illumination
faraday
could
have
had
but
an
imperfect
notion
of
the
expansions
of
which
his
discoveries
were
capable
still
he
had
a
vivid
and
strong
imagination
and
i
do
not
doubt
that
he
saw
possibilities
which
did
not
disclose
themselves
to
the
general
scientific
mind
he
knew
that
his
discoveries
had
their
practical
side
but
he
steadfastly
resisted
the
seductions
of
this
side
applying
himself
to
the
development
of
principles
being
well
aware
that
the
practical
question
would
receive
due
development
hereafter
during
my
sojourn
in
switzerland
this
year
i
read
through
the
proofs
of
this
new
edition
and
by
my
reading
was
confirmed
in
the
conviction
that
the
book
ought
not
to
be
suffered
to
go
out
of
print
the
memoir
was
written
under
great
pressure
but
i
am
not
ashamed
of
it
as
it
stands
glimpses
of
faraday
character
and
gleams
of
his
discoveries
are
there
to
be
found
which
will
be
of
interest
to
humanity
to
the
end
of
time

it
was
i
believe
my
husband
intention
to
substitute
this
preface
written
a
few
days
before
his
death
for
all
former
prefaces
as
however
he
had
not
the
opportunity
of
revising
the
old
prefatory
pages
himself
they
have
been
allowed
to
remain
just
as
they
stood
in
the
last
edition
louisa
c
tyndall
preface
to
the
fourth
edition
when
consulted
a
short
time
ago
as
to
the
republication
of
as
a
discoverer
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
labours
and
points
of
character
of
so
great
a
worker
and
so
good
a
man
should
not
be
allowed
to
vanish
from
the
public
eye
i
therefore
willingly
fell
in
with
the
proposal
of
my
publishers
to
issue
a
new
edition
of
the
little
book
royal
institution
february
preface
to
the
second
edition
the
experimental
researches
of
faraday
are
so
voluminous
their
descriptions
are
so
detailed
and
their
wealth
of
illustration
is
so
great
as
to
render
it
a
heavy
labour
to
master
them
the
multiplication
of
proofs
necessary
and
interesting
when
the
new
truths
had
to
be
established
are
however
less
needful
now
when
these
truths
have
become
household
words
in
science
i
have
therefore
tried
in
the
following
pages
to
compress
the
body
without
injury
to
the
spirit
of
these
imperishable
investigations
and
to
present
them
in
a
form
which
should
be
convenient
and
useful
to
the
student
of
the
present
day
while
i
write
the
volumes
of
the
life
of
faraday
by
bence
jones
have
reached
my
hands
to
them
the
reader
must
refer
for
an
account
of
faraday
private
relations
a
hasty
glance
at
the
work
shows
me
that
the
reverent
devotion
of
the
biographer
has
turned
to
admirable
account
the
materials
at
his
command
the
work
of
bence
jones
enables
me
to
correct
a
statement
regarding
wollaston
and
faraday
respective
relations
to
the
discovery
of
magnetic
rotation
wollaston
idea
was
to
make
the
wire
carrying
a
current
rotate
round
its
own
axis
an
idea
afterwards
realised
by
the
celebrated
ampere
faraday
discovery
was
to
make
the
wire
carrying
the
current
revolve
round
the
pole
of
a
magnet

it
has
been
thought
desirable
to
give
you
and
the
world
some
image
of
michael
faraday
as
a
scientific
investigator
and
discoverer
the
attempt
to
respond
to
this
desire
has
been
to
me
a
labour
of
difficulty
if
also
a
labour
of
love
for
however
well
acquainted
i
may
be
with
the
researches
and
discoveries
of
that
great
master
however
numerous
the
illustrations
which
occur
to
me
of
the
loftiness
of
faraday
character
and
the
beauty
of
his
life
still
to
grasp
him
and
his
researches
as
a
whole
to
seize
upon
the
ideas
which
guided
him
and
connected
them
to
gain
entrance
into
that
strong
and
active
brain
and
read
from
it
the
riddle
of
the
world
this
is
a
work
not
easy
of
performance
and
all
but
impossible
amid
the
distraction
of
duties
of
another
kind
that
i
should
at
one
period
or
another
speak
to
you
regarding
faraday
and
his
work
is
natural
if
not
inevitable
but
i
did
not
expect
to
be
called
upon
to
speak
so
soon
still
the
bare
suggestion
that
this
is
the
fit
and
proper
time
for
speech
sent
me
immediately
to
my
task
from
it
i
have
returned
with
such
results
as
i
could
gather
and
also
with
the
wish
that
those
results
were
more
worthy
than
they
are
of
the
greatness
of
my
theme
it
is
not
my
intention
to
lay
before
you
a
life
of
faraday
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
term
the
duty
i
have
to
perform
is
to
give
you
some
notion
of
what
he
has
done
in
the
world
dwelling
incidentally
on
the
spirit
in
which
his
work
was
executed
and
introducing
such
personal
traits
as
may
be
necessary
to
the
completion
of
your
picture
of
the
philosopher
though
by
no
means
adequate
to
give
you
a
complete
idea
of
the
man
the
newspapers
have
already
informed
you
that
michael
faraday
was
born
at
newington
butts
on
september
and
that
he
died
at
hampton
court
on
august
believing
as
i
do
in
the
general
truth
of
the
doctrine
of
hereditary
transmission
sharing
the
opinion
of
carlyle
that
really
able
man
never
proceeded
from
entirely
stupid
parents
i
once
used
the
privilege
of
my
intimacy
with
faraday
to
ask
him
whether
his
parents
showed
any
signs
of
unusual
ability
he
could
remember
none
his
father
i
believe
was
a
great
sufferer
during
the
latter
years
of
his
life
and
this
might
have
masked
whatever
intellectual
power
he
possessed
when
thirteen
years
old
that
is
to
say
in
faraday
was
apprenticed
to
a
bookseller
and
bookbinder
in
blandford
street
manchester
square
here
he
spent
eight
years
of
his
life
after
which
he
worked
as
a
journeyman
elsewhere
you
have
also
heard
the
account
of
faraday
first
contact
with
the
royal
institution
that
he
was
introduced
by
one
of
the
members
to
sir
humphry
davy
last
lectures
that
he
took
notes
of
those
lectures
wrote
them
fairly
out
and
sent
them
to
davy
entreating
him
at
the
same
time
to
enable
him
to
quit
trade
which
he
detested
and
to
pursue
science
which
he
loved
davy
was
helpful
to
the
young
man
and
this
should
never
be
forgotten
he
at
once
wrote
to
faraday
and
afterwards
when
an
opportunity
occurred
made
him
his
assistant
gassiot
has
lately
favoured
me
with
the
following
reminiscence
of
this
time
common
surrey
dear
tyndall
sir
davy
was
accustomed
to
call
on
the
late
pepys
in
the
poultry
on
his
way
to
the
london
institution
of
which
pepys
was
one
of
the
original
managers
the
latter
told
me
that
on
one
occasion
sir
davy
showing
him
a
letter
said
pepys
what
am
i
to
do
here
is
a
letter
from
a
young
man
named
faraday
he
has
been
attending
my
lectures
and
wants
me
to
give
him
employment
at
the
royal
institution
what
can
i
do
do
replied
pepys
put
him
to
wash
bottles
if
he
is
good
for
anything
he
will
do
it
directly
if
he
refuses
he
is
good
for
nothing
no
no
replied
davy
we
must
try
him
with
something
better
than
that
the
result
was
that
davy
engaged
him
to
assist
in
the
laboratory
at
weekly
wages
held
the
joint
office
of
professor
of
chemistry
and
director
of
the
laboratory
he
ultimately
gave
up
the
former
to
the
late
professor
brande
but
he
insisted
that
faraday
should
be
appointed
director
of
the
laboratory
and
as
faraday
told
me
this
enabled
him
on
subsequent
occasions
to
hold
a
definite
position
in
the
institution
in
which
he
was
always
supported
by
davy
i
believe
he
held
that
office
to
the
last
me
my
dear
tyndall
yours
truly
gassiot
tyndall
from
a
letter
written
by
faraday
himself
soon
after
his
appointment
as
davy
assistant
i
extract
the
following
account
of
his
introduction
to
the
royal
institution
for
myself
i
am
absent
from
home
nearly
day
and
night
except
occasional
calls
and
it
is
likely
shall
shortly
be
absent
entirely
but
this
having
nothing
more
to
say
and
at
the
request
of
my
mother
i
will
explain
to
you
i
was
formerly
a
bookseller
and
binder
but
am
now
turned
philosopher
which
happened
thus
whilst
an
apprentice
i
for
amusement
learnt
a
little
chemistry
and
other
parts
of
philosophy
and
felt
an
eager
desire
to
proceed
in
that
way
further
after
being
a
journeyman
for
six
months
under
a
disagreeable
master
i
gave
up
my
business
and
through
the
interest
of
a
sir
davy
filled
the
situation
of
chemical
assistant
to
the
royal
institution
of
great
britain
in
which
office
i
now
remain
and
where
i
am
constantly
employed
in
observing
the
works
of
nature
and
tracing
the
manner
in
which
she
directs
the
order
and
arrangement
of
the
world
i
have
lately
had
proposals
made
to
me
by
sir
humphry
davy
to
accompany
him
in
his
travels
through
europe
and
asia
as
philosophical
assistant
if
i
go
at
all
i
expect
it
will
be
in
october
next
about
the
end
and
my
absence
from
home
will
perhaps
be
as
long
as
three
years
but
as
yet
all
is
uncertain
this
account
is
supplemented
by
the
following
letter
written
by
faraday
to
his
friend
de
la
rive
on
the
occasion
of
the
death
of
marcet
the
letter
is
dated
september
dear
friend
your
subject
interested
me
deeply
every
way
for
marcet
was
a
good
friend
to
me
as
she
must
have
been
to
many
of
the
human
race
i
entered
the
shop
of
a
bookseller
and
bookbinder
at
the
age
of
thirteen
in
the
year
remained
there
eight
years
and
during
the
chief
part
of
my
time
bound
books
now
it
was
in
those
books
in
the
hours
after
work
that
i
found
the
beginning
of
my
philosophy
there
were
two
that
especially
helped
me
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
from
which
i
gained
my
first
notions
of
electricity
and
marcet
conversation
on
chemistry
which
gave
me
my
foundation
in
that
science
not
suppose
that
i
was
a
very
deep
thinker
or
was
marked
as
a
precocious
person
i
was
a
very
lively
imaginative
person
and
could
believe
in
the
arabian
nights
as
easily
as
in
the
encyclopaedia
but
facts
were
important
to
me
and
saved
me
i
could
trust
a
fact
and
always
an
assertion
so
when
i
questioned
book
by
such
little
experiments
as
i
could
find
means
to
perform
and
found
it
true
to
the
facts
as
i
could
understand
them
i
felt
that
i
had
got
hold
of
an
anchor
in
chemical
knowledge
and
clung
fast
to
it
thence
my
deep
veneration
for
marcet
first
as
one
who
had
conferred
great
personal
good
and
pleasure
on
me
and
then
as
one
able
to
convey
the
truth
and
principle
of
those
boundless
fields
of
knowledge
which
concern
natural
things
to
the
young
untaught
and
inquiring
mind
may
imagine
my
delight
when
i
came
to
know
marcet
personally
how
often
i
cast
my
thoughts
backward
delighting
to
connect
the
past
and
the
present
how
often
when
sending
a
paper
to
her
as
a
i
thought
of
my
first
instructress
and
such
like
thoughts
will
remain
with
me
have
some
such
thoughts
even
as
regards
your
own
father
who
was
i
may
say
the
first
who
personally
at
geneva
and
afterwards
by
correspondence
encouraged
and
by
that
sustained
me
twelve
or
thirteen
years
ago
faraday
and
myself
quitted
the
institution
one
evening
together
to
pay
a
visit
to
our
friend
grove
in
baker
street
he
took
my
arm
at
the
door
and
pressing
it
to
his
side
in
his
warm
genial
way
said
tyndall
i
will
now
show
you
something
that
will
interest
you
we
walked
northwards
passed
the
house
of
babbage
which
drew
forth
a
reference
to
the
famous
evening
parties
once
assembled
there
we
reached
blandford
street
and
after
a
little
looking
about
he
paused
before
a
stationer
shop
and
then
went
in
on
entering
the
shop
his
usual
animation
seemed
doubled
he
looked
rapidly
at
everything
it
contained
to
the
left
on
entering
was
a
door
through
which
he
looked
down
into
a
little
room
with
a
window
in
front
facing
blandford
street
drawing
me
towards
him
he
said
eagerly
there
tyndall
that
was
my
i
bound
books
in
that
little
nook
a
woman
stood
behind
the
counter
his
conversation
with
me
was
too
low
to
be
heard
by
her
and
he
now
turned
to
the
counter
to
buy
some
cards
as
an
excuse
for
our
being
there
he
asked
the
woman
her
name
her
predecessor
name
his
name
wo
do
he
said
with
impatience
was
his
predecessor
riebau
she
replied
and
immediately
added
as
if
suddenly
recollecting
herself
sir
was
the
master
of
sir
charles
faraday
he
responded
is
no
such
person
great
was
her
delight
when
i
told
her
the
name
of
her
visitor
but
she
assured
me
that
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
running
about
the
shop
she
she
did
not
know
why
that
it
must
be
charles
faraday
faraday
did
as
you
know
accompany
davy
to
rome
he
was
by
the
managers
of
the
royal
institution
on
may
here
he
made
rapid
progress
in
chemistry
and
after
a
time
was
entrusted
with
easy
analyses
by
davy
in
those
days
the
royal
institution
published
quarterly
journal
of
science
the
precursor
of
our
own
faraday
first
contribution
to
science
appeared
in
that
journal
in
it
was
an
analysis
of
some
caustic
lime
from
tuscany
which
had
been
sent
to
davy
by
the
duchess
of
montrose
between
this
period
and
various
notes
and
short
papers
were
published
by
faraday
in
he
experimented
upon
flames
professor
auguste
de
la
rive
had
investigated
those
sounding
flames
and
had
applied
to
them
an
explanation
which
completely
accounted
for
a
class
of
sounds
discovered
by
himself
but
did
not
account
for
those
known
to
his
predecessors
by
a
few
simple
and
conclusive
experiments
faraday
proved
the
explanation
insufficient
it
is
an
epoch
in
the
life
of
a
young
man
when
he
finds
himself
correcting
a
person
of
eminence
and
in
faraday
case
where
its
effect
was
to
develop
a
modest
such
an
event
could
not
fail
to
act
profitably
from
time
to
time
between
and
faraday
published
scientific
notes
and
notices
of
minor
weight
at
this
time
he
was
acquiring
not
producing
working
hard
for
his
master
and
storing
and
strengthening
his
own
mind
he
assisted
brande
in
his
lectures
and
so
quietly
skilfully
and
modestly
was
his
work
done
that
brande
vocation
at
the
time
was
pronounced
on
velvet
in

published
a
chemical
paper
two
new
compounds
of
chlorine
and
carbon
and
on
a
new
compound
of
iodine
carbon
and
hydrogen
this
paper
was
read
before
the
royal
society
on
december
and
it
was
the
first
of
his
that
was
honoured
with
a
place
in
the
transactions
on
june
he
married
and
obtained
leave
to
bring
his
young
wife
into
his
rooms
at
the
royal
institution
there
for
years
they
lived
together
occupying
the
suite
of
apartments
which
had
been
previously
in
the
successive
occupancy
of
young
davy
and
brande
at
the
time
of
her
marriage
faraday
was
years
of
age
he
being
nearly
thirty
regarding
this
marriage
i
will
at
present
limit
myself
to
quoting
an
entry
written
in
faraday
own
hand
in
his
book
of
diplomas
which
caught
my
eye
while
in
his
company
some
years
ago
it
ran
thus
january
these
records
and
events
i
here
insert
the
date
of
one
which
as
a
source
of
honour
and
happiness
far
exceeds
all
the
rest
we
were
married
on
june
faraday
then
follows
the
copy
of
the
minutes
dated
may
which
gave
him
additional
rooms
and
thus
enabled
him
to
bring
his
wife
to
the
royal
institution
a
feature
of
faraday
character
which
i
have
often
noticed
makes
itself
apparent
in
this
entry
in
his
relations
to
his
wife
he
added
chivalry
to
affection

here
is
davy
recommendation
of
faraday
presented
to
the
managers
of
the
royal
institution
at
a
meeting
on
the
of
march
charles
hatchett
in
the
chair
humphry
davy
has
the
honour
to
inform
the
managers
that
he
has
found
a
person
who
is
desirous
to
occupy
the
situation
in
the
institution
lately
filled
by
william
payne
his
name
is
michael
faraday
he
is
a
youth
of
years
of
age
as
far
as
sir
davy
has
been
able
to
observe
or
ascertain
he
appears
well
fitted
for
the
situation
his
habits
seem
good
his
disposition
active
and
cheerful
and
his
manner
intelligent
he
is
willing
to
engage
himself
on
the
same
terms
as
given
to
payne
at
the
time
of
quitting
the
institution
that
michael
faraday
be
engaged
to
fill
the
situation
lately
occupied
by
payne
on
the
same
terms
faraday
loved
this
word
and
employed
it
to
the
last
he
had
an
intense
dislike
to
the
modern
term
physicist
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
a
copy
of
the
original
letter
chapter
early
researches
magnetic
rotations
liquefaction
of
gases
heavy
glass
charles
anderson
contributions
to
physics
oersted
in
discovered
the
action
of
a
voltaic
current
on
a
magnetic
needle
and
immediately
afterwards
the
splendid
intellect
of
ampere
succeeded
in
showing
that
every
magnetic
phenomenon
then
known
might
be
reduced
to
the
mutual
action
of
electric
currents
the
subject
occupied
all
men
thoughts
and
in
this
country
wollaston
sought
to
convert
the
deflection
of
the
needle
by
the
current
into
a
permanent
rotation
of
the
needle
round
the
current
he
also
hoped
to
produce
the
reciprocal
effect
of
causing
a
current
to
rotate
round
a
magnet
in
the
early
part
of
wollaston
attempted
to
realise
this
idea
in
the
presence
of
sir
humphry
davy
in
the
laboratory
of
the
royal
institution
this
was
well
calculated
to
attract
faraday
attention
to
the
subject
he
read
much
about
it
and
in
the
months
of
july
august
and
september
he
wrote
a
of
the
progress
of
which
he
published
in
thomson
of
philosophy
soon
afterwards
he
took
up
the
subject
of
rotations
and
on
the
morning
of
he
called
his
wife
to
witness
for
the
first
time
the
revolution
of
a
magnetic
needle
round
an
electric
current
incidental
to
the
sketch
he
repeated
almost
all
the
experiments
there
referred
to
and
these
added
to
his
own
subsequent
work
made
him
practical
master
of
all
that
was
then
known
regarding
the
voltaic
current
in
he
also
touched
upon
a
subject
which
subsequently
received
his
closer
attention
the
vaporization
of
mercury
at
common
temperatures
and
immediately
afterwards
conducted
in
company
with
stodart
experiments
on
the
alloys
of
steel
he
was
accustomed
in
after
years
to
present
to
his
friends
razors
formed
from
one
of
the
alloys
then
discovered
during
faraday
hours
of
liberty
from
other
duties
he
took
up
subjects
of
inquiry
for
himself
and
in
the
spring
of
thus
he
began
the
examination
of
a
substance
which
had
long
been
regarded
as
the
chemical
element
chlorine
in
a
solid
form
but
which
sir
humphry
davy
in
had
proved
to
be
a
hydrate
of
chlorine
that
is
a
compound
of
chlorine
and
water
faraday
first
analysed
this
hydrate
and
wrote
out
an
account
of
its
composition
this
account
was
looked
over
by
davy
who
suggested
the
heating
of
the
hydrate
under
pressure
in
a
sealed
glass
tube
this
was
done
the
hydrate
fused
at
a
the
tube
became
filled
with
a
yellow
atmosphere
and
was
afterwards
found
to
contain
two
liquid
substances
paris
happened
to
enter
the
laboratory
while
faraday
was
at
work
seeing
the
oily
liquid
in
his
tube
he
rallied
the
young
chemist
for
his
carelessness
in
employing
soiled
vessels
on
filing
off
the
end
of
the
tube
its
contents
exploded
and
the
oily
matter
vanished
early
next
morning
paris
received
the
following
note
sir
the
oil
you
noticed
yesterday
turns
out
to
be
liquid
chlorine
faithfully
faraday
the
gas
had
been
liquefied
by
its
own
pressure
faraday
then
tried
compression
with
a
syringe
and
succeeded
thus
in
liquefying
the
gas
to
the
published
account
of
this
experiment
davy
added
the
following
note
desiring
faraday
to
expose
the
hydrate
of
chlorine
in
a
closed
glass
tube
it
occurred
to
me
that
one
of
three
things
would
happen
that
decomposition
of
water
would
occur
or
that
the
chlorine
would
separate
in
a
fluid
state
davy
moreover
immediately
applied
the
method
of
atmosphere
to
the
liquefaction
of
muriatic
gas
faraday
continued
the
experiments
and
succeeded
in
reducing
a
number
of
gases
till
then
deemed
permanent
to
the
liquid
condition
in
he
returned
to
the
subject
and
considerably
expanded
its
limits
these
important
investigations
established
the
fact
that
gases
are
but
the
vapours
of
liquids
possessing
a
very
low
and
gave
a
sure
basis
to
our
views
of
molecular
aggregation
the
account
of
the
first
investigation
was
read
before
the
royal
society
on
april
and
was
published
in
faraday
name
in
the
transactions
the
second
memoir
was
sent
to
the
royal
society
on
december
i
may
add
that
while
he
was
conducting
his
first
experiments
on
the
liquefaction
of
gases
thirteen
pieces
of
glass
were
on
one
occasion
driven
by
an
explosion
into
faraday
eye
some
small
notices
and
papers
including
the
observation
that
glass
readily
changes
colour
in
sunlight
follow
here
in
and
faraday
published
papers
in
the
transactions
on
compounds
of
carbon
and
hydrogen
and
on
acid
in
the
former
of
these
papers
he
announced
the
discovery
of
benzol
which
in
the
hands
of
modern
chemists
has
become
the
foundation
of
our
splendid
aniline
dyes
but
he
swerved
incessantly
from
chemistry
into
physics
and
in
we
find
him
engaged
in
investigating
the
limits
of
vaporization
and
showing
by
exceedingly
strong
and
apparently
conclusive
arguments
that
even
in
the
case
of
mercury
such
a
limit
exists
much
more
he
conceived
it
to
be
certain
that
our
atmosphere
does
not
contain
the
vapour
of
the
fixed
constituents
of
the
earth
crust
this
question
i
may
say
is
likely
to
remain
an
open
one
rankine
for
example
has
lately
drawn
attention
to
the
odour
of
certain
metals
whence
comes
this
odour
if
it
be
not
from
the
vapour
of
the
metal
in
faraday
became
a
member
of
a
committee
to
which
sir
john
herschel
and
dollond
also
belonged
appointed
by
the
royal
society
to
examine
and
if
possible
improve
the
manufacture
of
glass
for
optical
purposes
their
experiments
continued
till
when
the
account
of
them
constituted
the
subject
of
a
lecture
this
lectureship
founded
in
by
henry
baker
of

strand
london
provides
that
every
year
a
lecture
shall
be
given
before
the
royal
society
the
sum
of
four
pounds
being
paid
to
the
lecturer
the
bakerian
lecture
however
has
long
since
passed
from
the
region
of
pay
to
that

honour

the
manufacture
of
glass
for
optical
purposes
was
delivered
at
the
close
of
it
is
a
most
elaborate
and
conscientious
description
of
processes
precautions
and
results
the
details
were
so
exact
and
so
minute
and
the
paper
consequently
so
long
that
three
successive
sittings
of
the
royal
society
were
taken
up
by
the
delivery
of
the
lecture
this
glass
did
not
turn
out
to
be
of
important
practical
use
but
it
happened
afterwards
to
be
the
foundation
of
two
of
greatest
discoveries
the
experiments
here
referred
to
were
commenced
at
the
falcon
glass
works
on
the
premises
of
green
and
pellatt
but
faraday
could
not
conveniently
attend
to
them
there
in
therefore
a
furnace
was
erected
in
the
yard
of
the
royal
institution
and
it
was
at
this
time
and
with
a
view
of
assisting
him
at
the
furnace
that
faraday
engaged
sergeant
anderson
of
the
royal
artillery
the
respectable
truthful
and
altogether
trustworthy
man
whose
appearance
here
is
so
fresh
in
our
memories
anderson
continued
to
be
the
reverential
helper
of
faraday
and
the
faithful
servant
of
this
institution
for
nearly
forty
years
in
faraday
published
a
paper
a
peculiar
class
of
optical
deceptions
to
which
i
believe
the
beautiful
optical
toy
called
the
chromatrope
owes
its
origin
in
the
same
year
he
published
a
paper
on
vibrating
surfaces
in
which
he
solved
an
acoustical
problem
which
though
of
extreme
simplicity
when
solved
appears
to
have
baffled
many
eminent
men
the
problem
was
to
account
for
the
fact
that
light
bodies
such
as
the
seed
of
lycopodium
collected
at
the
vibrating
parts
of
sounding
plates
while
sand
ran
to
the
nodal
lines
faraday
showed
that
the
light
bodies
were
entangled
in
the
little
whirlwinds
formed
in
the
air
over
the
places
of
vibration
and
through
which
the
heavier
sand
was
readily
projected
faraday
resources
as
an
experimentalist
were
so
wonderful
and
his
delight
in
experiment
was
so
great
that
he
sometimes
almost
ran
into
excess
in
this
direction
i
have
heard
him
say
that
this
paper
on
vibrating
surfaces
was
too
heavily
laden
with
experiments

the

from
a

from
sir
john
herschel
written
to
me
from
collingwood
on
the
of
november
will
take
this
opportunity
to
mention
that
i
believe
myself
to
have
originated
the
suggestion
of
the
employment
of
borate
of
lead
for
optical
purposes
it
was
somewhere
in
the
year
as
well
as
i
can
recollect
that
i
mentioned
it
to
sir
james
then
south
and
in
consequence
the
trial
was
made
in
his
laboratory
in
blackman
street
by
precipitating
and
working
a
large
quantity
of
borate
of
lead
and
fusing
it
under
a
muffle
in
a
porcelain
evaporating
dish
a
very
limpid
though
slightly
yellow
glass
resulted
the
refractive
index
which
you
will
find
set
down
in
my
table
of
refractive
indices
in
my
article
light
encyclopaedia
metropolitana
it
was
however
too
soft
for
optical
use
as
an
glass
this
faraday
overcame
at
least
to
a
considerable
degree
by
the
introduction
of
silica

the
work
thus
referred
to
though
sufficient
of
itself
to
secure
no

scientific
reputation
forms
but
the
vestibule
of
achievements
he
had
been
engaged
within
these
walls
for
eighteen
years
during
part
of
the
time
he
had
drunk
in
knowledge
from
davy
and
during
the
remainder
he
continually
exercised
his
capacity
for
independent
inquiry
in
we
have
him
at
the
climax
of
his
intellectual
strength
forty
years
of
age
stored
with
knowledge
and
full
of
original
power
through
reading
lecturing
and
experimenting
he
had
become
thoroughly
familiar
with
electrical
science
he
saw
where
light
was
needed
and
expansion
possible
the
phenomena
of
ordinary
electric
induction
belonged
as
it
were
to
the
alphabet
of
his
knowledge
he
knew
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
the
presence
of
an
electrified
body
was
sufficient
to
excite
by
induction
an
unelectrified
body
he
knew
that
the
wire
which
carried
an
electric
current
was
an
electrified
body
and
still
that
all
attempts
had
failed
to
make
it
excite
in
other
wires
a
state
similar
to
its
own
what
was
the
reason
of
this
failure
faraday
never
could
work
from
the
experiments
of
others
however
clearly
described
he
knew
well
that
from
every
experiment
issues
a
kind
of
radiation
luminous
in
different
degrees
to
different
minds
and
he
hardly
trusted
himself
to
reason
upon
an
experiment
that
he
had
not
seen
in
the
autumn
of
he
began
to
repeat
the
experiments
with
electric
currents
which
up
to
that
time
had
produced
no
positive
result
and
here
for
the
sake
of
younger
inquirers
if
not
for
the
sake
of
us
all
it
is
worth
while
to
dwell
for
a
moment
on
a
power
which
faraday
possessed
in
an
extraordinary
degree
he
united
vast
strength
with
perfect
flexibility
his
momentum
was
that
of
a
river
which
combines
weight
and
directness
with
the
ability
to
yield
to
the
flexures
of
its
bed
the
intentness
of
his
vision
in
any
direction
did
not
apparently
diminish
his
power
of
perception
in
other
directions
and
when
he
attacked
a
subject
expecting
results
he
had
the
faculty
of
keeping
his
mind
alert
so
that
results
different
from
those
which
he
expected
should
not
escape
him
through
preoccupation
he
began
his
experiments
the
induction
of
electric
currents
by
composing
a
helix
of
two
insulated
wires
which
were
wound
side
by
side
round
the
same
wooden
cylinder
one
of
these
wires
he
connected
with
a
voltaic
battery
of
ten
cells
and
the
other
with
a
sensitive
galvanometer
when
connection
with
the
battery
was
made
and
while
the
current
flowed
no
effect
whatever
was
observed
at
the
galvanometer
but
he
never
accepted
an
experimental
result
until
he
had
applied
to
it
the
utmost
power
at
his
command
he
raised
his
battery
from
cells
to
cells
but
without
avail
the
current
flowed
calmly
through
the
battery
wire
without
producing
during
its
flow
any
sensible
result
upon
the
galvanometer
its
flow
and
this
was
the
time
when
an
effect
was
expected
but
here
faraday
power
of
lateral
vision
separating
as
it
were
from
the
line
of
expectation
came
into
play
he
noticed
that
a
feeble
movement
of
the
needle
always
occurred
at
the
moment
when
he
made
contact
with
the
battery
that
the
needle
would
afterwards
return
to
its
former
position
and
remain
quietly
there
unaffected
by
the
flowing
current
at
the
moment
however
when
the
circuit
was
interrupted
the
needle
again
moved
and
in
a
direction
opposed
to
that
observed
on
the
completion
of
the
circuit
this
result
and
others
of
a
similar
kind
led
him
to
the
conclusion
the
battery
current
through
the
one
wire
did
in
reality
induce
a
similar
current
through
the
other
but
that
it
continued
for
an
instant
only
and
partook
more
of
the
nature
of
the
electric
wave
from
a
common
leyden
jar
than
of
the
current
from
a
voltaic
battery
the
momentary
currents
thus
generated
were
called
induced
currents
while
the
current
which
generated
them
was
called
the
inducing
current
it
was
immediately
proved
that
the
current
generated
at
making
the
circuit
was
always
opposed
in
direction
to
its
generator
while
that
developed
on
the
rupture
of
the
circuit
coincided
in
direction
with
the
inducing
current
it
appeared
as
if
the
current
on
its
first
rush
through
the
primary
wire
sought
a
purchase
in
the
secondary
one
and
by
a
kind
of
kick
impelled
backward
through
the
latter
an
electric
wave
which
subsided
as
soon
as
the
primary
current
was
fully
established
faraday
for
a
time
believed
that
the
secondary
wire
though
quiescent
when
the
primary
current
had
been
once
established
was
not
in
its
natural
condition
its
return
to
that
condition
being
declared
by
the
current
observed
at
breaking
the
circuit
he
called
this
hypothetical
state
of
the
wire
the
state
he
afterwards
abandoned
this
hypothesis
but
seemed
to
return
to
it
in
later
life
the
term
is
also
preserved
by
professor
du
bois
reymond
to
express
a
certain
electric
condition
of
the
nerves
and
professor
clerk
maxwell
has
ably
defined
and
illustrated
the
hypothesis
in
the
tenth
volume
of
the
of
the
cambridge
philosophical
society
the
mere
approach
of
a
wire
forming
a
closed
curve
to
a
second
wire
through
which
a
voltaic
current
flowed
was
then
shown
by
faraday
to
be
sufficient
to
arouse
in
the
neutral
wire
an
induced
current
opposed
in
direction
to
the
inducing
current
the
withdrawal
of
the
wire
also
generated
a
current
having
the
same
direction
as
the
inducing
current
those
currents
existed
only
during
the
time
of
approach
or
withdrawal
and
when
neither
the
primary
nor
the
secondary
wire
was
in
motion
no
matter
how
close
their
proximity
might
be
no
induced
current
was
generated
faraday
has
been
called
a
purely
inductive
philosopher
a
great
deal
of
nonsense
is
i
fear
uttered
in
this
land
of
england
about
induction
and
deduction
some
profess
to
befriend
the
one
some
the
other
while
the
real
vocation
of
an
investigator
like
faraday
consists
in
the
incessant
marriage
of
both
he
was
at
this
time
full
of
the
theory
of
ampere
and
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
numbers
of
his
experiments
were
executed
merely
to
test
his
deductions
from
that
theory
starting
from
the
discovery
of
oersted
the
illustrious
french
philosopher
had
shown
that
all
the
phenomena
of
magnetism
then
known
might
be
reduced
to
the
mutual
attractions
and
repulsions
of
electric
currents
magnetism
had
been
produced
from
electricity
and
faraday
who
all
his
life
long
entertained
a
strong
belief
in
such
reciprocal
actions
now
attempted
to
effect
the
evolution
of
electricity
from
magnetism
round
a
welded
iron
ring
he
placed
two
distinct
coils
of
covered
wire
causing
the
coils
to
occupy
opposite
halves
of
the
ring
connecting
the
ends
of
one
of
the
coils
with
a
galvanometer
he
found
that
the
moment
the
ring
was
magnetised
by
sending
a
current
through
the
other
coil
the
galvanometer
needle
whirled
round
four
or
five
times
in
succession
the
action
as
before
was
that
of
a
pulse
which
vanished
immediately
on
interrupting
the
circuit
a
whirl
of
the
needle
in
the
opposite
direction
occurred
it
was
only
during
the
time
of
magnetization
or
demagnetization
that
these
effects
were
produced
the
induced
currents
declared
a
change
of
condition
only
and
they
vanished
the
moment
the
act
of
magnetization
or
demagnetization
was
complete
the
effects
obtained
with
the
welded
ring
were
also
obtained
with
straight
bars
of
iron
whether
the
bars
were
magnetised
by
the
electric
current
or
were
excited
by
the
contact
of
permanent
steel
magnets
induced
currents
were
always
generated
during
the
rise
and
during
the
subsidence
of
the
magnetism
the
use
of
iron
was
then
abandoned
and
the
same
effects
were
obtained
by
merely
thrusting
a
permanent
steel
magnet
into
a
coil
of
wire
a
rush
of
electricity
through
the
coil
accompanied
the
insertion
of
the
magnet
an
equal
rush
in
the
opposite
direction
accompanied
its
withdrawal
the
precision
with
which
faraday
describes
these
results
and
the
completeness
with
which
he
defines
the
boundaries
of
his
facts
are
wonderful
the
magnet
for
example
must
not
be
passed
quite
through
the
coil
but
only
half
through
for
if
passed
wholly
through
the
needle
is
stopped
as
by
a
blow
and
then
he
shows
how
this
blow
results
from
a
reversal
of
the
electric
wave
in
the
helix
he
next
operated
with
the
powerful
permanent
magnet
of
the
royal
society
and
obtained
with
it
in
an
exalted
degree
all
the
foregoing
phenomena
and
now
he
turned
the
light
of
these
discoveries
upon
the
darkest
physical
phenomenon
of
that
day
arago
had
discovered
in
that
a
disk
of
metal
had
the
power
of
bringing
a
vibrating
magnetic
needle
suspended
over
it
rapidly
to
rest
and
that
on
causing
the
disk
to
rotate
the
magnetic
needle
rotated
along
with
it
when
both
were
quiescent
there
was
not
the
slightest
measurable
attraction
or
repulsion
exerted
between
the
needle
and
the
disk
still
when
in
motion
the
disk
was
competent
to
drag
after
it
not
only
a
light
needle
but
a
heavy
magnet
the
question
had
been
probed
and
investigated
with
admirable
skill
both
by
arago
and
ampere
and
poisson
had
published
a
theoretic
memoir
on
the
subject
but
no
cause
could
be
assigned
for
so
extraordinary
an
action
it
had
also
been
examined
in
this
country
by
two
celebrated
men
babbage
and
sir
john
herschel
but
it
still
remained
a
mystery
faraday
always
recommended
the
suspension
of
judgment
in
cases
of
doubt
have
always
admired
he
says
prudence
and
philosophical
reserve
shown
by
arago
in
resisting
the
temptation
to
give
a
theory
of
the
effect
he
had
discovered
so
long
as
he
could
not
devise
one
which
was
perfect
in
its
application
and
in
refusing
to
assent
to
the
imperfect
theories
of
others
now
however
the
time
for
theory
had
come
faraday
saw
mentally
the
rotating
disk
under
the
operation
of
the
magnet
flooded
with
his
induced
currents
and
from
the
known
laws
of
interaction
between
currents
and
magnets
he
hoped
to
deduce
the
motion
observed
by
arago
that
hope
he
realised
showing
by
actual
experiment
that
when
his
disk
rotated
currents
passed
through
it
their
position
and
direction
being
such
as
must
in
accordance
with
the
established
laws
of
action
produce
the
observed
rotation
introducing
the
edge
of
his
disk
between
the
poles
of
the
large
horseshoe
magnet
of
the
royal
society
and
connecting
the
axis
and
the
edge
of
the
disk
each
by
a
wire
with
a
galvanometer
he
obtained
when
the
disk
was
turned
round
a
constant
flow
of
electricity
the
direction
of
the
current
was
determined
by
the
direction
of
the
motion
the
current
being
reversed
when
the
rotation
was
reversed
he
now
states
the
law
which
rules
the
production
of
currents
in
both
disks
and
wires
and
in
so
doing
uses
for
the
first
time
a
phrase
which
has
since
become
famous
when
iron
filings
are
scattered
over
a
magnet
the
particles
of
iron
arrange
themselves
in
certain
determinate
lines
called
magnetic
curves
in
faraday
for
the
first
time
called
these
curves
of
magnetic
force
and
he
showed
that
to
produce
induced
currents
neither
approach
to
nor
withdrawal
from
a
magnetic
source
or
centre
or
pole
was
essential
but
that
it
was
only
necessary
to
cut
appropriately
the
lines
of
magnetic
force
faraday
first
paper
on
induction
which
i
have
here
endeavoured
to
condense
was
read
before
the
royal
society
on
the
of
november
on
january
he
communicated
to
the
royal
society
a
second
paper
on
terrestrial
induction
which
was
chosen
as
the
bakerian
lecture
for
the
year
he
placed
a
bar
of
iron
in
a
coil
of
wire
and
lifting
the
bar
into
the
direction
of
the
dipping
needle
he
excited
by
this
action
a
current
in
the
coil
on
reversing
the
bar
a
current
in
the
opposite
direction
rushed
through
the
wire
the
same
effect
was
produced
when
on
holding
the
helix
in
the
line
of
dip
a
bar
of
iron
was
thrust
into
it
here
however
the
earth
acted
on
the
coil
through
the
intermediation
of
the
bar
of
iron
he
abandoned
the
bar
and
simply
set
a
copper
plate
spinning
in
a
horizontal
plane
he
knew
that
the
earth
lines
of
magnetic
force
then
crossed
the
plate
at
an
angle
of
about
when
the
plate
spun
round
the
lines
of
force
were
intersected
and
induced
currents
generated
which
produced
their
proper
effect
when
carried
from
the
plate
to
the
galvanometer
the
plate
was
in
the
magnetic
meridian
or
in
any
other
plane
coinciding
with
the
magnetic
dip
then
its
rotation
produced
no
effect
upon
the
galvanometer
at
the
suggestion
of
a
mind
fruitful
in
suggestions
of
a
profound
and
philosophic
character
i
mean
that
of
sir
john
herschel
barlow
of
woolwich
had
experimented
with
a
rotating
iron
shell
christie
had
also
performed
an
elaborate
series
of
experiments
on
a
rotating
iron
disk
both
of
them
had
found
that
when
in
rotation
the
body
exercised
a
peculiar
action
upon
the
magnetic
needle
deflecting
it
in
a
manner
which
was
not
observed
during
quiescence
but
neither
of
them
was
aware
at
the
time
of
the
agent
which
produced
this
extraordinary
deflection
they
ascribed
it
to
some
change
in
the
magnetism
of
the
iron
shell
and
disk
but
faraday
at
once
saw
that
his
induced
currents
must
come
into
play
here
and
he
immediately
obtained
them
from
an
iron
disk
with
a
hollow
brass
ball
moreover
he
produced
the
effects
obtained
by
barlow
iron
was
in
no
way
necessary
the
only
condition
of
success
was
that
the
rotating
body
should
be
of
a
character
to
admit
of
the
formation
of
currents
in
its
substance
it
must
in
other
words
be
a
conductor
of
electricity
the
higher
the
conducting
power
the
more
copious
were
the
currents
he
now
passes
from
his
little
brass
globe
to
the
globe
of
the
earth
he
plays
like
a
magician
with
the
earth
magnetism
he
sees
the
invisible
lines
along
which
its
magnetic
action
is
exerted
and
sweeping
his
wand
across
these
lines
evokes
this
new
power
placing
a
simple
loop
of
wire
round
a
magnetic
needle
he
bends
its
upper
portion
to
the
west
the
north
pole
of
the
needle
immediately
swerves
to
the
east
he
bends
his
loop
to
the
east
and
the
north
pole
moves
to
the
west
suspending
a
common
bar
magnet
in
a
vertical
position
he
causes
it
to
spin
round
its
own
axis
its
pole
being
connected
with
one
end
of
a
galvanometer
wire
and
its
equator
with
the
other
end
electricity
rushes
round
the
galvanometer
from
the
rotating
magnet
he
remarks
upon
the
independence
of
the
magnetism
and
the
body
of
the
magnet
which
carries
it
the
steel
behaves
as
if
it
were
isolated
from
its
own
magnetism
and
then
his
thoughts
suddenly
widen
and
he
asks
himself
whether
the
rotating
earth
does
not
generate
induced
currents
as
it
turns
round
its
axis
from
west
to
east
in
his
experiment
with
the
twirling
magnet
the
galvanometer
wire
remained
at
rest
one
portion
of
the
circuit
was
in
motion
relatively
to
another
portion
but
in
the
case
of
the
twirling
planet
the
galvanometer
wire
would
necessarily
be
carried
along
with
the
earth
there
would
be
no
relative
motion
what
must
be
the
consequence
take
the
case
of
a
telegraph
wire
with
its
two
terminal
plates
dipped
into
the
earth
and
suppose
the
wire
to
lie
in
the
magnetic
meridian
the
ground
underneath
the
wire
is
influenced
like
the
wire
itself
by
the
earth
rotation
if
a
current
from
south
to
north
be
generated
in
the
wire
a
similar
current
from
south
to
north
would
be
generated
in
the
earth
under
the
wire
these
currents
would
run
against
the
same
terminal
plate
and
thus
neutralise
each
other
this
inference
appears
inevitable
but
his
profound
vision
perceived
its
possible
invalidity
he
saw
that
it
was
at
least
possible
that
the
difference
of
conducting
power
between
the
earth
and
the
wire
might
give
one
an
advantage
over
the
other
and
that
thus
a
residual
or
differential
current
might
be
obtained
he
combined
wires
of
different
materials
and
caused
them
to
act
in
opposition
to
each
other
but
found
the
combination
ineffectual
the
more
copious
flow
in
the
better
conductor
was
exactly
counterbalanced
by
the
resistance
of
the
worse
still
though
experiment
was
thus
emphatic
he
would
clear
his
mind
of
all
discomfort
by
operating
on
the
earth
itself
he
went
to
the
round
lake
near
kensington
palace
and
stretched
feet
of
copper
wire
north
and
south
over
the
lake
causing
plates
soldered
to
the
wire
at
its
ends
to
dip
into
the
water
the
copper
wire
was
severed
at
the
middle
and
the
severed
ends
connected
with
a
galvanometer
no
effect
whatever
was
observed
but
though
quiescent
water
gave
no
effect
moving
water
might
he
therefore
worked
at
london
bridge
for
three
days
during
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide
but
without
any
satisfactory
result
still
he
urges
it
seems
a
necessary
consequence
that
where
water
is
flowing
there
electric
currents
should
be
formed
if
a
line
be
imagined
passing
from
dover
to
calais
through
the
sea
and
returning
through
the
land
beneath
the
water
to
dover
it
traces
out
a
circuit
of
conducting
matter
one
part
of
which
when
the
water
moves
up
or
down
the
channel
is
cutting
the
magnetic
curves
of
the
earth
whilst
the
other
is
relatively
at
rest
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
currents
do
run
in
the
general
direction
of
the
circuit
described
either
one
way
or
the
other
according
as
the
passage
of
the
waters
is
up
or
down
the
channel
this
was
written
before
the
submarine
cable
was
thought
of
and
he
once
informed
me
that
actual
observation
upon
that
cable
had
been
found
to
be
in
accordance
with
his
theoretic
deduction
three
years
subsequent
to
the
publication
of
these
researches
that
is
to
say
on
january
faraday
read
before
the
royal
society
a
paper
the
influence
by
induction
of
an
electric
current
upon
itself
a
shock
and
spark
of
a
peculiar
character
had
been
observed
by
a
young
man
named
william
jenkin
who
must
have
been
a
youth
of
some
scientific
promise
but
who
as
faraday
once
informed
me
was
dissuaded
by
his
own
father
from
having
anything
to
do
with
science
the
investigation
of
the
fact
noticed
by
jenkin
led
faraday
to
the
discovery
of
the
extra
current
or
the
current
induced
in
the
primary
wire
itself
at
the
moments
of
making
and
breaking
contact
the
phenomena
of
which
he
described
and
illustrated
in
the
beautiful
and
exhaustive
paper
referred
to
years
have
passed
since
the
discovery
of
but
if
we
except
the
extra
current
until
quite
recently
nothing
of
moment
was
added
to
the
subject
faraday
entertained
the
opinion
that
the
discoverer
of
a
great
law
or
principle
had
a
right
to
the
this
was
his
term
arising
from
its
illustration
and
guided
by
the
principle
he
had
discovered
his
wonderful
mind
aided
by
his
wonderful
ten
fingers
overran
in
a
single
autumn
this
vast
domain
and
hardly
left
behind
him
the
shred
of
a
fact
to
be
gathered
by
his
successors
and
here
the
question
may
arise
in
some
minds
what
is
the
use
of
it
all
the
answer
is
that
if
man
intellectual
nature
thirsts
for
knowledge
then
knowledge
is
useful
because
it
satisfies
this
thirst
if
you
demand
practical
ends
you
must
i
think
expand
your
definition
of
the
term
practical
and
make
it
include
all
that
elevates
and
enlightens
the
intellect
as
well
as
all
that
ministers
to
the
bodily
health
and
comfort
of
men
still
if
needed
an
answer
of
another
kind
might
be
given
to
the
question
is
its
use
as
far
as
electricity
has
been
applied
for
medical
purposes
it
has
been
almost
exclusively
electricity
you
have
noticed
those
lines
of
wire
which
cross
the
streets
of
london
it
is
faraday
currents
that
speed
from
place
to
place
through
these
wires
approaching
the

of

the
mariner
sees
an
unusually
brilliant

and
from
the
noble

at
the

the
board
of
trade
and
the
brethren
of
the
trinity
house
as
well
as
the
commissioners
of
northern
lights
are
contemplating
the
introduction
of
the
light
at
numerous
points
upon
our
coasts
and
future
generations
will
be
able
to
refer
to
those
guiding
stars
in
answer
to
the
question
what
has
been
the
practical
use
of
the
labours
of
faraday
but
i
would
again
emphatically
say
that
his
work
needs
no
such
justification
and
that
if
he
had
allowed
his
vision
to
be
disturbed
by
considerations
regarding
the
practical
use
of
his
discoveries
those
discoveries
would
never
have
been
made
by
him
have
rather
he
writes
in
desirous
of
discovering
new
facts
and
new
relations
dependent
on
induction
than
of
exalting
the
force
of
those
already
obtained
being
assured
that
the
latter
would
find
their
full
development
hereafter
in
when
lecturing
before
a
private
society
in
london
on
the
element
chlorine
faraday
thus
expressed
himself
with
reference
to
this
question
of
utility
leaving
this
subject
i
will
point
out
the
history
of
this
substance
as
an
answer
to
those
who
are
in
the
habit
of
saying
to
every
new
fact
what
is
its
use
franklin
says
to
such
what
is
the
use
of
an
infant
the
answer
of
the
experimentalist
is
endeavour
to
make
it
useful
when
scheele
discovered
this
substance
it
appeared
to
have
no
use
it
was
in
its
infancy
and
useless
state
but
having
grown
up
to
maturity
witness
its
powers
and
see
what

footnote

chapter
i
am
indebted
to
a
friend
for
the
following
exquisite
morsel
short
time
after
the
publication
of
first
researches
in
he
attended
the
meeting
of
the
british
association
at
oxford
in
on
this
occasion
he
was
requested
by
some
of
the
authorities
to
repeat
the
celebrated
experiment
of
eliciting
a
spark
from
a
magnet
employing
for
this
purpose
the
large
magnet
in
the
ashmolean
museum
to
this
he
consented
and
a
large
party
assembled
to
witness
the
experiments
which
i
need
not
say
were
perfectly
successful
whilst
he
was
repeating
them
a
dignitary
of
the
university
entered
the
room
and
addressing
himself
to
professor
daniell
who
was
standing
near
faraday
inquired
what
was
going
on
the
professor
explained
to
him
as
popularly
as
possible
this
striking
result
of
great
discovery
the
dean
listened
with
attention
and
looked
earnestly
at
the
brilliant
spark
but
a
moment
after
he
assumed
a
serious
countenance
and
shook
his
head
i
am
sorry
for
it
said
he
as
he
walked
away
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
stopped
for
a
moment
and
repeated
i
am
sorry
for
it
then
walking
towards
the
door
when
the
handle
was
in
his
hand
he
turned
round
and
said
indeed
i
am
sorry
for
it
it
is
putting
new
arms
into
the
hands
of
the
incendiary
this
occurred
a
short
time
after
the
papers
had
been
filled
with
the
doings
of
the
hayrick
burners
an
erroneous
statement
of
what
fell
from
the
dean
mouth
was
printed
at
the
time
in
one
of
the
oxford
papers
he
is
there
wrongly
stated
to
have
said
it
is
putting
new
arms
into
the
hands
of
the
infidel
chapter
points
of
character
a
point
highly
illustrative
of
the
character
of
faraday
now
comes
into
view
he
gave
an
account
of
his
discovery
of
in
a
letter
to
his
friend
hachette
of
paris
who
communicated
the
letter
to
the
academy
of
sciences
the
letter
was
translated
and
published
and
immediately
afterwards
two
distinguished
italian
philosophers
took
up
the
subject
made
numerous
experiments
and
published
their
results
before
the
complete
memoirs
of
faraday
had
met
the
public
eye
this
evidently
irritated
him
he
reprinted
the
paper
of
the
learned
italians
in
the
magazine
accompanied
by
sharp
critical
notes
from
himself
he
also
wrote
a
letter
dated
to
gay
lussac
who
was
then
one
of
the
editors
of
the
de
chimie
in
which
he
analysed
the
results
of
the
italian
philosophers
pointing
out
their
errors
and
defending
himself
from
what
he
regarded
as
imputations
on
his
character
the
style
of
this
letter
is
unexceptionable
for
faraday
could
not
write
otherwise
than
as
a
gentleman
but
the
letter
shows
that
had
he
willed
it
he
could
have
hit
hard
we
have
heard
much
of
gentleness
and
sweetness
and
tenderness
it
is
all
true
but
it
is
very
incomplete
you
can
not
resolve
a
powerful
nature
into
these
elements
and
faraday
character
would
have
been
less
admirable
than
it
was
had
it
not
embraced
forces
and
tendencies
to
which
the
silky
adjectives
and
would
by
no
means
apply
underneath
his
sweetness
and
gentleness
was
the
heat
of
a
volcano
he
was
a
man
of
excitable
and
fiery
nature
but
through
high
he
had
converted
the
fire
into
a
central
glow
and
motive
power
of
life
instead
of
permitting
it
to
waste
itself
in
useless
passion
that
is
slow
to
anger
saith
the
sage
greater
than
the
mighty
and
he
that
ruleth
his
own
spirit
than
he
that
taketh
a
city
faraday
was
not
slow
to
anger
but
he
completely
ruled
his
own
spirit
and
thus
though
he
took
no
cities
he
captivated
all
hearts
as
already
intimated
faraday
had
contributed
many
of
his
minor
papers
including
his
first
analysis
of
caustic
lime
to
the
journal
of
science
in
he
collected
those
papers
and
others
together
in
a
small
octavo
volume
labelled
them
and
prefaced
them
thus
notes
notices
published
in
octavo
up
to
m
faraday
of
mine
published
in
octavo
in
the
quarterly
journal
of
science
and
elsewhere
since
the
time
that
sir
davy
encouraged
me
to
write
the
analysis
of
caustic
lime
i
think
at
this
date
are
good
others
moderate
and
some
bad
but
i
have
put
all
into
the
volume
because
of
the
utility
they
have
been
of
to
me
and
none
more
than
the
bad
in
pointing
out
to
me
in
future
or
rather
after
times
the
faults
it
became
me
to
watch
and
to
avoid
i
never
looked
over
one
of
my
papers
a
year
after
it
was
written
without
believing
both
in
philosophy
and
manner
it
could
have
been
much
better
done
i
still
hope
the
collection
may
be
of
great
use
to
me
faraday
more
than
the
bad
this
is
a
bit
of
faraday
innermost
nature
and
as
i
read
these
words
i
am
almost
constrained
to
retract
what
i
have
said
regarding
the
fire
and
excitability
of
his
character
but
is
he
not
all
the
more
admirable
through
his
ability
to
tone
down
and
subdue
that
fire
and
that
excitability
so
as
to
render
himself
able
to
write
thus
as
a
little
child
i
once
took
the
liberty
of
censuring
the
conclusion
of
a
letter
of
his
to
the
dean
of
paul
he
subscribed
himself
yours
and
i
objected
to
the
adverb
but
tyndall
he
said
am
humble
and
still
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
to
think
that
i
am
not
also
proud
this
duality
ran
through
his
character
a
democrat
in
his
defiance
of
all
authority
which
unfairly
limited
his
freedom
of
thought
and
still
ready
to
stoop
in
reverence
to
all
that
was
really
worthy
of
reverence
in
the
customs
of
the
world
or
the
characters
of
men
and
here
as
well
as
elsewhere
may
be
introduced
a
letter
which
bears
upon
this
question
of
written
long
years
subsequent
to
the
period
at
which
we
have
now
arrived
i
had
been
at
glasgow
in
at
a
meeting
of
the
british
association
on
a
certain
day
i
communicated
a
paper
to
the
physical
section
which
was
followed
by
a
brisk
discussion
men
of
great
distinction
took
part
in
it
the
late
whewell
among
the
number
and
it
waxed
warm
on
both
sides
i
was
by
no
means
content
with
this
discussion
and
least
of
all
with
my
own
part
in
it
this
discontent
affected
me
for
some
days
during
which
i
wrote
to
faraday
giving
him
no
details
but
expressing
in
a
general
way
my
dissatisfaction
i
give
the
following
extract
from
his
reply
dear
tyndall
these
great
meetings
of
which
i
think
very
well
altogether
advance
science
chiefly
by
bringing
scientific
men
together
and
making
them
to
know
and
be
friends
with
each
other
and
i
am
sorry
when
that
is
not
the
effect
in
every
part
of
their
course
i
know
nothing
except
from
what
you
tell
me
for
i
have
not
yet
looked
at
the
reports
of
the
proceedings
but
let
me
as
an
old
man
who
ought
by
this
time
to
have
profited
by
experience
say
that
when
i
was
younger
i
found
i
often
misinterpreted
the
intentions
of
people
and
found
they
did
not
mean
what
at
the
time
i
supposed
they
meant
and
further
that
as
a
general
rule
it
was
better
to
be
a
little
dull
of
apprehension
where
phrases
seemed
to
imply
pique
and
quick
in
perception
when
on
the
contrary
they
seemed
to
imply
kindly
feeling
the
real
truth
never
fails
ultimately
to
appear
and
opposing
parties
if
wrong
are
sooner
convinced
when
replied
to
forbearingly
than
when
overwhelmed
all
i
mean
to
say
is
that
it
is
better
to
be
blind
to
the
results
of
partisanship
and
quick
to
see
good
will
one
has
more
happiness
in
oneself
in
endeavouring
to
follow
the
things
that
make
for
peace
you
can
hardly
imagine
how
often
i
have
been
heated
in
private
when
opposed
as
i
have
thought
unjustly
and
superciliously
and
yet
i
have
striven
and
succeeded
i
hope
in
keeping
down
replies
of
the
like
kind
and
i
know
i
have
never
lost
by
it
i
would
not
say
all
this
to
you
did
i
not
esteem
you
as
a
true
philosopher
and
friend
very
truly
faraday

faraday
would
have
been
rejoiced
to
learn
that
during
its
last
meeting
at
dundee
the
british
association
illustrated
in
a
striking
manner
the
function
which
he
here
describes
as
its
principal
one
in
my
own
case
a
brotherly
welcome
was

identity

electricities
first
researches
on
i
have
already
once
used
the
word
in
reference
to
the
occasional
state
of
faraday
mind
when
experimenting
it
was
to
him
a
discomfort
to
reason
upon
data
which
admitted
of
doubt
he
hated
what
he
called
knowledge
and
ever
tended
either
to
transfer
it
into
the
region
of
undoubtful
knowledge
or
of
certain
and
definite
ignorance
pretence
of
all
kinds
whether
in
life
or
in
philosophy
was
hateful
to
him
he
wished
to
know
the
reality
of
our
nescience
as
well
as
of
our
science
one
thing
or
the
other
he
seemed
to
say
to
an
unproved
hypothesis
out
as
a
solid
truth
or
disappear
as
a
convicted
lie
after
making
the
great
discovery
which
i
have
attempted
to
describe
a
doubt
seemed
to
beset
him
as
regards
the
identity
of
electricities
it
right
he
seemed
to
ask
call
this
agency
which
i
have
discovered
electricity
at
all
are
there
perfectly
conclusive
grounds
for
believing
that
the
electricity
of
the
machine
the
pile
the
gymnotus
and
torpedo
and
are
merely
different
manifestations
of
one
and
the
same
agent
to
answer
this
question
to
his
own
satisfaction
he
formally
reviewed
the
knowledge
of
that
day
he
added
to
it
new
experiments
of
his
own
and
finally
decided
in
favour
of
the
of
electricities
his
paper
upon
this
subject
was
read
before
the
royal
society
on
january
and
after
he
had
proved
to
his
own
satisfaction
the
identity
of
electricities
he
tried
to
compare
them
quantitatively
together
the
terms
quantity
and
intensity
which
faraday
constantly
used
need
a
word
of
explanation
here
he
might
charge
a
single
leyden
jar
by
twenty
turns
of
his
machine
or
he
might
charge
a
battery
of
ten
jars
by
the
same
number
of
turns
the
quantity
in
both
cases
would
be
sensibly
the
same
but
the
intensity
of
the
single
jar
would
be
the
greatest
for
here
the
electricity
would
be
less
diffused
faraday
first
satisfied
himself
that
the
needle
of
his
galvanometer
was
caused
to
swing
through
the
same
arc
by
the
same
quantity
of
machine
electricity
whether
it
was
condensed
in
a
small
battery
or
diffused
over
a
large
one
thus
the
electricity
developed
by
thirty
turns
of
his
machine
produced
under
very
variable
conditions
of
battery
surface
the
same
deflection
hence
he
inferred
the
possibility
of
comparing
as
regards
quantity
electricities
which
differ
greatly
from
each
other
in
intensity
his
object
now
is
to
compare
frictional
with
voltaic
electricity
moistening
bibulous
paper
with
the
iodide
of
potassium
a
favourite
test
of
his
and
subjecting
it
to
the
action
of
machine
electricity
he
decomposed
the
iodide
and
formed
a
brown
spot
where
the
iodine
was
liberated
then
he
immersed
two
wires
one
of
zinc
the
other
of
platinum
each
of
an
inch
in
diameter
to
a
depth
of
of
an
inch
in
acidulated
water
during
eight
beats
of
his
watch
or
of
a
second
and
found
that
the
needle
of
his
galvanometer
swung
through
the
same
arc
and
coloured
his
moistened
paper
to
the
same
extent
as
thirty
turns
of
his
large
electrical
machine
turns
of
the
machine
produced
an
effect
distinctly
less
than
that
produced
by
his
two
wires
now
the
quantity
of
water
decomposed
by
the
wires
in
this
experiment
totally
eluded
observation
it
was
immeasurably
small
and
still
that
amount
of
decomposition
involved
the
development
of
a
quantity
of
electric
force
which
if
applied
in
a
proper
form
would
kill
a
rat
and
no
man
would
like
to
bear
it
in
his
subsequent
researches
the
absolute
quantity
of
electricity
associated
with
the
particles
or
atoms
of
matter
he
endeavours
to
give
an
idea
of
the
amount
of
electrical
force
involved
in
the
decomposition
of
a
single
grain
of
water
he
is
almost
afraid
to
mention
it
for
he
estimates
it
at
discharges
of
his
large
leyden
battery
this
if
concentrated
in
a
single
discharge
would
be
equal
to
a
very
great
flash
of
lightning
while
the
chemical
action
of
a
single
grain
of
water
on
four
grains
of
zinc
would
yield
electricity
equal
in
quantity
to
a
powerful
thunderstorm
thus
his
mind
rises
from
the
minute
to
the
vast
expanding
involuntarily
from
the
smallest
laboratory
fact
till
it
embraces
the
largest
and
grandest
natural
phenomena
in
reality
however
he
is
at
this
time
only
clearing
his
way
and
he
continues
laboriously
to
clear
it
for
some
time
afterwards
he
is
digging
the
shaft
guided
by
that
instinct
towards
the
mineral
lode
which
was
to
him
a
rod
of
divination
riecht
die
wahrheit
said
the
lamented
kohlrausch
an
eminent
german
once
in
my
hearing
smells
the
truth
his
eyes
are
now
steadily
fixed
on
this
wonderful
voltaic
current
and
he
must
learn
more
of
its
mode
of
transmission
on
may
he
read
a
paper
before
the
royal
society
a
new
law
of
electric
conduction
he
found
that
though
the
current
passed
through
water
it
did
not
pass
through
ice
why
not
since
they
are
one
and
the
same
substance
some
years
subsequently
he
answered
this
question
by
saying
that
the
liquid
condition
enables
the
molecule
of
water
to
turn
round
so
as
to
place
itself
in
the
proper
line
of
polarization
while
the
rigidity
of
the
solid
condition
prevents
this
arrangement
this
polar
arrangement
must
precede
decomposition
and
decomposition
is
an
accompaniment
of
conduction
he
then
passed
on
to
other
substances
to
oxides
and
chlorides
and
iodides
and
salts
and
sulphurets
and
found
them
all
insulators
when
solid
and
conductors
when
fused
in
all
cases
moreover
except
one
and
this
exception
he
thought
might
be
apparent
only
he
found
the
passage
of
the
current
across
the
fused
compound
to
be
accompanied
by
its
decomposition
is
then
the
act
of
decomposition
essential
to
the
act
of
conduction
in
these
bodies
even
recently
this
question
was
warmly
contested
faraday
was
very
cautious
latterly
in
expressing
himself
upon
this
subject
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
held
that
an
infinitesimal
quantity
of
electricity
might
pass
through

no

faraday
has
now
got
fairly
entangled
amid
the
chemical
phenomena
of
the
pile
and
here
his
previous
training
under
davy
must
have
been
of
the
most
important
service
to
him
why
he
asks
should
decomposition
thus
take
place
what
force
is
it
that
wrenches
the
locked
constituents
of
these
compounds
asunder
on
the
of
june
he
read
a
paper
before
the
royal
society
decomposition
in
which
he
seeks
to
answer
these
questions
the
notion
had
been
entertained
that
the
poles
as
they
are
called
of
the
decomposing
cell
or
in
other
words
the
surfaces
by
which
the
current
enters
and
quits
the
liquid
exercised
electric
attractions
upon
the
constituents
of
the

and
tore
them
asunder
faraday
combats
this
notion
with
extreme
vigour

compounded
of
the
alkali

and
sulphuric

the
voltaic

passing
through
a
solution
of
this
salt

steeped
a
piece
of
litmus
paper
and
a
piece
of
turmeric
paper
in
a
solution
of
sulphate
of
soda
placing
each
of
them
upon
a
separate
plate
of
glass
he
connected
them
together
by
means
of
a
string
moistened
with
the
same
solution
he
then
attached
one
of
them
to
the
positive
conductor
of
an
electric
machine
and
the
other
to
the
of
this
building
these
he
called
his
train
on
turning
the
machine
the
electricity
passed
from
paper
to
paper
through
the
string
which
might
be
varied
in
length
from
a
few
inches
to
seventy
feet
without
changing
the
result
the
first
paper
was
reddened
declaring
the
presence
of
sulphuric
acid
the
second
was
browned
declaring
the
presence
of
the
alkali
soda
the
dissolved
salt
therefore
arranged
in
this
fashion
was
decomposed
by
the
machine
exactly
as
it
would
have
been
by
the
voltaic
current
when
instead
of
using
the
positive
conductor
he
used
the
negative
the
positions
of
the
acid
and
alkali
were
reversed
thus
he
satisfied
himself
that
chemical
decomposition
by
the
machine
is
obedient
to
the
laws
which
rule
decomposition
by
the
pile
and
now
he
gradually
abolishes
those
poles
to
the
attraction
of
which
electric
decomposition
had
been
ascribed
he
connected
a
piece
of
turmeric
paper
moistened
with
the
sulphate
of
soda
with
the
positive
conductor
of
his
machine
then
he
placed
a
metallic
point
in
connection
with
his
discharging
train
opposite
the
moist
paper
so
that
the
electricity
should
discharge
through
the
air
towards
the
point
the
turning
of
the
machine
caused
the
corners
of
the
piece
of
turmeric
paper
opposite
to
the
point
to
turn
brown
thus
declaring
the
presence
of
alkali
he
changed
the
turmeric
for
litmus
paper
and
placed
it
not
in
connection
with
his
conductor
but
with
his
discharging
train
a
metallic
point
connected
with
the
conductor
being
fixed
at
a
couple
of
inches
from
the
paper
on
turning
the
machine
acid
was
liberated
at
the
edges
and
corners
of
the
litmus
he
then
placed
a
series
of
pointed
pieces
of
paper
each
separate
piece
being
composed
of
two
halves
one
of
litmus
and
the
other
of
turmeric
paper
and
all
moistened
with
sulphate
of
soda
in
the
line
of
the
current
from
the
machine
the
pieces
of
paper
were
separated
from
each
other
by
spaces
of
air
the
machine
was
turned
and
it
was
always
found
that
at
the
point
where
the
electricity
entered
the
paper
litmus
was
reddened
and
at
the
point
where
it
quitted
the
paper
turmeric
was
browned
he
urges
poles
are
entirely
abandoned
but
we
have
still
electrochemical
decomposition
it
is
evident
to
him
that
instead
of
being
attracted
by
the
poles
the
bodies
separated
are
ejected
by
the
current
the
effects
thus
obtained
with
poles
of
air
he
also
succeeded
in
obtaining
with
poles
of
water
the
advance
in
faraday
own
ideas
made
at
this
time
is
indicated
by
the
word
he
afterwards
reiterates
this
view
the
evolved
substances
are
expelled
from
the
decomposing
body
and
drawn
out
by
an
attraction
having
abolished
this
idea
of
polar
attraction
he
proceeds
to
enunciate
and
develop
a
theory
of
his
own
he
refers
to
davy
celebrated
bakerian
lecture
given
in
which
he
says
almost
entirely
occupied
in
the
consideration
of
electrochemical
decompositions
the
facts
recorded
in
that
lecture
faraday
regards
as
of
the
utmost
value
but
mode
of
action
by
which
the
effects
take
place
is
stated
very
generally
so
generally
indeed
that
probably
a
dozen
precise
schemes
of
electrochemical
action
might
be
drawn
up
differing
essentially
from
each
other
yet
all
agreeing
with
the
statement
there
given
it
appears
to
me
that
these
words
might
with
justice
be
applied
to
faraday
own
researches
at
this
time
they
furnish
us
with
results
of
permanent
value
but
little
help
can
be
found
in
the
theory
advanced
to
account
for
them
it
would
perhaps
be
more
correct
to
say
that
the
theory
itself
is
hardly
presentable
in
any
tangible
form
to
the
intellect
faraday
looks
and
rightly
looks
into
the
heart
of
the
decomposing
body
itself
he
sees
and
rightly
sees
active
within
it
the
forces
which
produce
the
decomposition
and
he
rejects
and
rightly
rejects
the
notion
of
external
attraction
but
beyond
the
hypothesis
of
decompositions
and
recompositions
enunciated
and
developed
by
grothuss
and
davy
he
does
not
i
think
help
us
to
any
definite
conception
as
to
how
the
force
reaches
the
decomposing
mass
and
acts
within
it
nor
indeed
can
this
be
done
until
we
know
the
true
physical
process
which
underlies
what
we
call
an
electric
current
faraday
conceives
of
that
current
as
axis
of
power
having
contrary
forces
exactly
equal
in
amount
in
opposite
directions
but
this
definition
though
much
quoted
and
circulated
teaches
us
nothing
regarding
the
current
an
here
can
only
mean
a
direction
and
what
we
want
to
be
able
to
conceive
of
is
not
the
axis
along
which
the
power
acts
but
the
nature
and
mode
of
action
of
the
power
itself
he
objects
to
the
vagueness
of
de
la
rive
but
the
fact
is
that
both
he
and
de
la
rive
labour
under
the
same
difficulty
neither
wishes
to
commit
himself
to
the
notion
of
a
current
compounded
of
two
electricities
flowing
in
two
opposite
directions
but
the
time
had
not
come
nor
is
it
yet
come
for
the
displacement
of
this
provisional
fiction
by
the
true
mechanical
conception
still
however
indistinct
the
theoretic
notions
of
faraday
at
this
time
may
be
the
facts
which
are
rising
before
him
and
around
him
are
leading
him
gradually
but
surely
to
results
of
incalculable
importance
in
relation
to
the
philosophy
of
the
voltaic
pile
he
had
always
some
great
object
of
research
in
view
but
in
the
pursuit
of
it
he
frequently
alighted
on
facts
of
collateral
interest
to
examine
which
he
sometimes
turned
aside
from
his
direct
course
thus
we
find
the
series
of
his
researches
on
electrochemical
decomposition
interrupted
by
an
inquiry
into
power
of
metals
and
other
solids
to
induce
the
combination
of
gaseous
bodies
this
inquiry
which
was
received
by
the
royal
society
on
though
not
so
important
as
those
which
precede
and
follow
it
illustrates
throughout
his
strength
as
an
experimenter
the
power
of
spongy
platinum
to
cause
the
combination
of
oxygen
and
hydrogen
had
been
discovered
by
dobereiner
in
and
had
been
applied
by
him
in
the
construction
of
his
philosophic
lamp
it
was
shown
subsequently
by
dulong
and
thenard
that
even
a
platinum
wire
when
perfectly
cleansed
may
be
raised
to
incandescence
by
its
action
on
a
jet
of
cold
hydrogen
in
his
experiments
on
the
decomposition
of
water
faraday
found
that
the
positive
platinum
plate
of
the
decomposing
cell
possessed
in
an
extraordinary
degree
the
power
of
causing
oxygen
and
hydrogen
to
combine
he
traced
the
cause
of
this
to
the
perfect
cleanness
of
the
positive
plate
against
it
was
liberated
oxygen
which
with
the
powerful
affinity
of
the
state
swept
away
all
impurity
from
the
surface
against
which
it
was
liberated
the
bubbles
of
gas
liberated
on
one
of
the
platinum
plates
or
wires
of
a
decomposing
cell
are
always
much
smaller
and
they
rise
in
much
more
rapid
succession
than
those
from
the
other
knowing
that
oxygen
is
sixteen
times
heavier
than
hydrogen
i
have
more
than
once
concluded
and
i
fear
led
others
into
the
error
of
concluding
that
the
smaller
and
more
quickly
rising
bubbles
must
belong
to
the
lighter
gas
the
thing
appeared
so
obvious
that
i
did
not
give
myself
the
trouble
of
looking
at
the
battery
which
would
at
once
have
told
me
the
nature
of
the
gas
but
faraday
would
never
have
been
satisfied
with
a
deduction
if
he
could
have
reduced
it
to
a
fact
and
he
has
taught
me
that
the
fact
here
is
the
direct
reverse
of
what
i
supposed
it
to
be
the
small
bubbles
are
oxygen
and
their
smallness
is
due
to
the
perfect
cleanness
of
the
surface
on
which
they
are
liberated
the
hydrogen
adhering
to
the
other
electrode
swells
into
large
bubbles
which
rise
in
much
slower
succession
but
when
the
current
is
reversed
the
hydrogen
is
liberated
upon
the
cleansed
wire
and
then
its
bubbles
also
become

laws
of
decomposition
in
our
conceptions
and
reasonings
regarding
the
forces
of
nature
we
perpetually
make
use
of
symbols
which
when
they
possess
a
high
representative
value
we
dignify
with
the
name
of
theories
thus
prompted
by
certain
analogies
we
ascribe
electrical
phenomena
to
the
action
of
a
peculiar
fluid
sometimes
flowing
sometimes
at
rest
such
conceptions
have
their
advantages
and
their
disadvantages
they
afford
peaceful
lodging
to
the
intellect
for
a
time
but
they
also
circumscribe
it
and
when
the
mind
has
grown
too
large
for
its
lodging
it
often
finds
difficulty
in
breaking
down
the
walls
of
what
has
become
its
prison
instead
of
its
home
no
man
ever
felt
this
tyranny
of
symbols
more
deeply
than
faraday
and
no
man
was
ever
more
assiduous
than
he
to
liberate
himself
from
them
and
the
terms
which
suggested
them
calling
whewell
to
his
aid
in
he
endeavoured
to
displace
by
others
all
terms
tainted
by
a
foregone
conclusion
his
paper
on
decomposition
received
by
the
royal
society
on
january
opens
with
the
proposal
of
a
new
terminology
he
would
avoid
the
word
if
he
could
he
does
abandon
the
word
as
applied
to
the
ends
of
a
decomposing
cell
because
it
suggests
the
idea
of
attraction
substituting
for
it
the
perfectly
natural
term
electrodes
he
applied
the
term
electrolyte
to
every
substance
which
can
be
decomposed
by
the
current
and
the
act
of
decomposition
he
called
electrolysis
all
these
terms
have
become
current
in
science
he
called
the
positive
electrode
the
anode
and
the
negative
one
the
cathode
but
these
terms
though
frequently
used
have
not
enjoyed
the
same
currency
as
the
others
the
terms
anion
and
cation
which
he
applied
to
the
constituents
of
the
decomposed
electrolyte
and
the
term
ion
which
included
both
anions
and
cations
are
still
less
frequently
employed
faraday
now
passes
from
terminology
to
research
he
sees
the
necessity
of
quantitative
determinations
and
seeks
to
supply
himself
with
a
measure
of
voltaic
electricity
this
he
finds
in
the
quantity
of
water
decomposed
by
the
current
he
tests
this
measure
in
all
possible
ways
to
assure
himself
that
no
error
can
arise
from
its
employment
he
places
in
the
course
of
one
and
the
same
current
a
series
of
cells
with
electrodes
of
different
sizes
some
of
them
plates
of
platinum
others
merely
platinum
wires
and
collects
the
gas
liberated
on
each
distinct
pair
of
electrodes
he
finds
the
quantity
of
gas
to
be
the
same
for
all
thus
he
concludes
that
when
the
same
quantity
of
electricity
is
caused
to
pass
through
a
series
of
cells
containing
acidulated
water
the
action
is
independent
of
the
size
of
the
electrodes
he
next
proves
that
variations
in
intensity
do
not
interfere
with
this
equality
of
action
whether
his
battery
is
charged
with
strong
acid
or
with
weak
whether
it
consists
of
five
pairs
or
of
fifty
pairs
in
short
whatever
be
its
source
when
the
same
current
is
sent
through
his
series
of
cells
the
same
amount
of
decomposition
takes
place
in
all
he
next
assures
himself
that
the
strength
or
weakness
of
his
dilute
acid
does
not
interfere
with
this
law
sending
the
same
current
through
a
series
of
cells
containing
mixtures
of
sulphuric
acid
and
water
of
different
strengths
he
finds
however
the
proportion
of
acid
to
water
might
vary
the
same
amount
of
gas
to
be
collected
in
all
the
cells
a
crowd
of
facts
of
this
character
forced
upon
faraday
mind
the
conclusion
that
the
amount
of
decomposition
depends
not
upon
the
size
of
the
electrodes
not
upon
the
intensity
of
the
current
not
upon
the
strength
of
the
solution
but
solely
upon
the
quantity
of
electricity
which
passes
through
the
cell
the
quantity
of
electricity
he
concludes
is
proportional
to
the
amount
of
chemical
action
on
this
law
faraday
based
the
construction
of
his
celebrated
voltameter
or
measure
of
voltaic
electricity
but
before
he
can
apply
this
measure
he
must
clear
his
ground
of
numerous
possible
sources
of
error
the
decomposition
of
his
acidulated
water
is
certainly
a
direct
result
of
the
current
but
as
the
varied
and
important
researches
of
mm
becquerel
de
la
rive
and
others
had
shown
there
are
also
secondary
actions
which
may
materially
interfere
with
and
complicate
the
pure
action
of
the
current
these
actions
may
occur
in
two
ways
either
the
liberated
ion
may
seize
upon
the
electrode
against
which
it
is
set
free
forming
a
chemical
compound
with
that
electrode
or
it
may
seize
upon
the
substance
of
the
electrolyte
itself
and
thus
introduce
into
the
circuit
chemical
actions
over
and
above
those
due
to
the
current
faraday
subjected
these
secondary
actions
to
an
exhaustive
examination
instructed
by
his
experiments
and
rendered
competent
by
them
to
distinguish
between
primary
and
secondary
results
he
proceeds
to
establish
the
doctrine
of
decomposition
into
the
same
circuit
he
introduced
his
voltameter
which
consisted
of
a
graduated
tube
filled
with
acidulated
water
and
provided
with
platinum
plates
for
the
decomposition
of
the
water
and
also
a
cell
containing
chloride
of
tin
experiments
already
referred
to
had
taught
him
that
this
substance
though
an
insulator
when
solid
is
a
conductor
when
fused
the
passage
of
the
current
being
always
accompanied
by
the
decomposition
of
the
chloride
he
wished
to
ascertain
what
relation
this
decomposition
bore
to
that
of
the
water
in
his
voltameter
completing
his
circuit
he
permitted
the
current
to
continue
until
reasonable
quantity
of
gas
was
collected
in
the
voltameter
the
circuit
was
then
broken
and
the
quantity
of
tin
liberated
compared
with
the
quantity
of
gas
the
weight
of
the
former
was
grains
that
of
the
latter
of
a
grain
oxygen
as
you
know
unites
with
hydrogen
in
the
proportion
of
to
to
form
water
calling
the
equivalent
or
as
it
is
sometimes
called
the
atomic
weight
of
hydrogen
that
of
oxygen

that
of
water

consequently
or
now
if
the
quantity
of
water
decomposed
in
faraday
experiment
be
represented
by
the
number
or
in
other
words
by
the
equivalent
of
water
then
the
quantity
of
tin
liberated
from
the
fused
chloride
is
found
by
an
easy
calculation
to
be
which
is
almost
exactly
the
chemical
equivalent
of
tin
thus
both
the
water
and
the
chloride
were
broken
up
in
proportions
expressed
by
their
respective
equivalents
the
amount
of
electric
force
which
wrenched
asunder
the
constituents
of
the
molecule
of
water
was
competent
and
neither
more
nor
less
than
competent
to
wrench
asunder
the
constituents
of
the
molecules
of
the
chloride
of
tin
the
fact
is
typical
with
the
indications
of
his
voltameter
he
compared
the
decompositions
of
other
substances
both
singly
and
in
series
he
submitted
his
conclusions
to
numberless
tests
he
purposely
introduced
secondary
actions
he
endeavoured
to
hamper
the
fulfilment
of
those
laws
which
it
was
the
intense
desire
of
his
mind
to
see
established
but
from
all
these
difficulties
emerged
the
golden
truth
that
under
every
variety
of
circumstances
the
decompositions
of
the
voltaic
current
are
as
definite
in
their
character
as
those
chemical
combinations
which
gave
birth
to
the
atomic
theory
this
law
of
decomposition
ranks
in
point
of
importance
with
that
of
definite
combining
proportions
in
chemistry

origin
of
power
in
the
voltaic
pile
in
one
of
the
public
areas
of
the
town
of
como
stands
a
statue
with
no
inscription
on
its
pedestal
save
that
of
a
single
name
the
bearer
of
that
name
occupies
a
place
for
ever
memorable
in
the
history
of
science
to
him
we
owe
the
discovery
of
the
voltaic
pile
to
which
for
a
brief
interval
we
must
now
turn
our
attention
the
objects
of
scientific
thought
being
the
passionless
laws
and
phenomena
of
external
nature
one
might
suppose
that
their
investigation
and
discussion
would
be
completely
withdrawn
from
the
region
of
the
feelings
and
pursued
by
the
cold
dry
light
of
the
intellect
alone
this
however
is
not
always
the
case
man
carries
his
heart
with
him
into
all
his
works
you
can
not
separate
the
moral
and
emotional
from
the
intellectual
and
thus
it
is
that
the
discussion
of
a
point
of
science
may
rise
to
the
heat
of
a
the
fight
between
the
rival
optical
theories
of
emission
and
undulation
was
of
this
fierce
character
and
scarcely
less
fierce
for
many
years
was
the
contest
as
to
the
origin
and
maintenance
of
the
power
of
the
voltaic
pile
volta
himself
supposed
it
to
reside
in
the
contact
of
different
metals
here
was
exerted
his
force
which
tore
the
combined
electricities
asunder
and
drove
them
as
currents
in
opposite
directions
to
render
the
circulation
of
the
current
possible
it
was
necessary
to
connect
the
metals
by
a
moist
conductor
for
when
any
two
metals
were
connected
by
a
third
their
relation
to
each
other
was
such
that
a
complete
neutralisation
of
the
electric
motion
was
the
result
theory
of
metallic
contact
was
so
clear
so
beautiful
and
apparently
so
complete
that
the
best
intellects
of
europe
accepted
it
as
the
expression
of
natural
law
volta
himself
knew
nothing
of
the
chemical
phenomena
of
the
pile
but
as
soon
as
these
became
known
suggestions
and
intimations
appeared
that
chemical
action
and
not
metallic
contact
might
be
the
real
source
of
voltaic
electricity
this
idea
was
expressed
by
fabroni
in
italy
and
by
wollaston
in
england
it
was
developed
and
maintained
by
those
electricians
becquerel
of
paris
and
de
la
rive
of
geneva
the
contact
theory
on
the
other
hand
received
its
chief
development
and
illustration
in
germany
it
was
long
the
scientific
creed
of
the
great
chemists
and
natural
philosophers
of
that
country
and
to
the
present
hour
there
may
be
some
of
them
unable
to
liberate
themselves
from
the
fascination
of
their
after
the
researches
which
i
have
endeavoured
to
place
before
you
it
was
impossible
for
faraday
to
avoid
taking
a
side
in
this
controversy
he
did
so
in
a
paper
the
electricity
of
the
voltaic
pile
received
by
the
royal
society
on
the
of
april
his
position
in
the
controversy
might
have
been
predicted
he
saw
chemical
effects
going
hand
in
hand
with
electrical
effects
the
one
being
proportional
to
the
other
and
in
the
paper
now
before
us
he
proved
that
when
the
former
was
excluded
the
latter
were
sought
for
in
vain
he
produced
a
current
without
metallic
contact
he
discovered
liquids
which
though
competent
to
transmit
the
feeblest
currents
competent
therefore
to
allow
the
electricity
of
contact
to
flow
through
them
if
it
were
able
to
form
a
current
were
absolutely
powerless
when
chemically
inactive
one
of
the
very
few
experimental
mistakes
of
faraday
occurred
in
this
investigation
he
thought
that
with
a
single
voltaic
cell
he
had
obtained
the
spark
before
the
metals
touched
but
he
subsequently
discovered
his
error
to
enable
the
voltaic
spark
to
pass
through
air
before
the
terminals
of
the
battery
were
united
it
was
necessary
to
exalt
the
force
of
the
battery
by
multiplying
its
elements
but
all
the
elements
faraday
possessed
were
unequal
to
the
task
of
urging
the
spark
across
the
shortest
measurable
space
of
air
nor
indeed
could
the
action
of
the
battery
the
different
metals
of
which
were
in
contact
with
each
other
decide
the
point
in
question
still
as
regards
the
identity
of
electricities
from
various
sources
it
was
at
that
day
of
great
importance
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
voltaic
current
could
jump
as
a
spark
across
an
interval
before
contact
faraday
friend
gassiot
solved
this
problem
he
erected
a
battery
of
cells
and
with
it
urged
a
stream
of
sparks
from
terminal
to
terminal
when
separated
from
each
other
by
a
measurable
space
of
air
the
memoir
on
the
of
the
voltaic
pile
published
in
appears
to
have
produced
but
little
impression
upon
the
supporters
of
the
contact
theory
these
indeed
were
men
of
too
great
intellectual
weight
and
insight
lightly
to
take
up
or
lightly
to
abandon
a
theory
faraday
therefore
resumed
the
attack
in
a
paper
communicated
to
the
royal
society
on
the
of
february
in
this
paper
he
hampered
his
antagonists
by
a
crowd
of
adverse
experiments
he
hung
difficulty
after
difficulty
about
the
neck
of
the
contact
theory
until
in
its
efforts
to
escape
from
his
assaults
it
so
changed
its
character
as
to
become
a
thing
totally
different
from
the
theory
proposed
by
volta
the
more
persistently
it
was
defended
however
the
more
clearly
did
it
show
itself
to
be
a
congeries
of
devices
bearing
the
stamp
of
dialectic
skill
rather
than
of
natural
truth
in
conclusion
faraday
brought
to
bear
upon
it
an
argument
which
had
its
full
weight
and
purport
been
understood
at
the
time
would
have
instantly
decided
the
controversy
contact
theory
he
urged
that
a
force
which
is
able
to
overcome
powerful
resistance
as
for
instance
that
of
the
conductors
good
or
bad
through
which
the
current
passes
and
that
again
of
the
electrolytic
action
where
bodies
are
decomposed
by
it
can
arise
out
of
nothing
that
without
any
change
in
the
acting
matter
or
the
consumption
of
any
generating
force
a
current
shall
be
produced
which
shall
go
on
for
ever
against
a
constant
resistance
or
only
be
stopped
as
in
the
voltaic
trough
by
the
ruins
which
its
exertion
has
heaped
up
in
its
own
course
this
would
indeed
be
a
creation
of
power
and
is
like
no
other
force
in
nature
we
have
many
processes
by
which
the
form
of
the
power
may
be
so
changed
that
an
apparent
conversion
of
one
into
the
other
takes
place
so
we
can
change
chemical
force
into
the
electric
current
or
the
current
into
chemical
force
the
beautiful
experiments
of
seebeck
and
peltier
show
the
convertibility
of
heat
and
electricity
and
others
by
oersted
and
myself
show
the
convertibility
of
electricity
and
magnetism
but
in
no
case
not
even
in
those
of
the
gymnotus
and
torpedo
is
there
a
pure
creation
or
a
production
of
power
without
a
corresponding
exhaustion
of
something
to
supply
it
these
words
were
published
more
than
two
years
before
either
mayer
printed
his
brief
but
celebrated
essay
on
the
forces
of
inorganic
nature
or
joule
published
his
first
famous
experiments
on
the
mechanical
value
of
heat
they
illustrate
the
fact
that
before
any
great
scientific
principle
receives
distinct
enunciation
by
individuals
it
dwells
more
or
less
clearly
in
the
general
scientific
mind
the
intellectual
plateau
is
already
high
and
our
discoverers
are
those
who
like
peaks
above
the
plateau
rise
a
little
above
the
general
level
of
thought
at
the
time
but
many
years
prior
even
to
the
foregoing
utterance
of
faraday
a
similar
argument
had
been
employed
i
quote
here
with
equal
pleasure
and
admiration
the
following
passage
written
by
roget
so
far
back
as
speaking
of
the
contact
theory
he
says
there
could
exist
a
power
having
the
property
ascribed
to
it
by
the
hypothesis
namely
that
of
giving
continual
impulse
to
a
fluid
in
one
constant
direction
without
being
exhausted
by
its
own
action
it
would
differ
essentially
from
all
the
known
powers
in
nature
all
the
powers
and
sources
of
motion
with
the
operation
of
which
we
are
acquainted
when
producing
these
peculiar
effects
are
expended
in
the
same
proportion
as
those
effects
are
produced
and
hence
arises
the
impossibility
of
obtaining
by
their
agency
a
perpetual
effect
or
in
other
words
a
perpetual
motion
but
the
force
ascribed
by
volta
to
the
metals
when
in
contact
is
a
force
which
as
long
as
a
free
course
is
allowed
to
the
electricity
it
sets
in
motion
is
never
expended
and
continues
to
be
excited
with
undiminished
power
in
the
production
of
a
effect
against
the
truth
of
such
a
supposition
the
probabilities
are
all
but
infinite
when
this
argument
which
he
employed
independently
had
clearly
fixed
itself
in
his
mind
faraday
never
cared
to
experiment
further
on
the
source
of
electricity
in
the
voltaic
pile
the
argument
appeared
to
him
remove
the
foundation
itself
of
the
contact
theory
and
he
afterwards
let
it
crumble
down
in
peace
footnote
to
chapter
to
account
for
the
electric
current
which
was
really
the
core
of
the
whole
discussion
faraday
demonstrated
the
impotence
of
the
contact
theory
as
then
enunciated
and
defended
still
it
is
certain
that
two
different
metals
when
brought
into
contact
charge
themselves
the
one
with
positive
and
the
other
with
negative
electricity
i
had
the
pleasure
of
going
over
this
ground
with
kohlrausch
in
and
his
experiments
left
no
doubt
upon
my
mind
that
the
contact
electricity
of
volta
was
a
reality
though
it
could
produce
no
current
with
one
of
the
beautiful
instruments
devised
by
himself
sir
william
thomson
has
rendered
this
point
capable
of
sure
and
easy
demonstration
and
he
and
others
now
hold
what
may
be
called
a
contact
theory
which
while
it
takes
into
account
the
action
of
the
metals
also
embraces
the
chemical
phenomena
of
the
circuit
helmholtz
i
believe
was
the
first
to
give
the
contact
theory
this
new
form

his
celebrated
essay

the
burst
of
power
which
had
filled
the
four
preceding
years
with
an
amount
of
experimental
work
unparalleled
in
the
history
of
science
partially
subsided
in
and
the
only
scientific
paper
contributed
by
faraday
in
that
year
was
a
comparatively
unimportant
one
an
improved
form
of
the
voltaic
battery
he
brooded
for
a
time
his
experiments
on
electrolysis
had
long
filled
his
mind
he
looked
as
already
stated
into
the
very
heart
of
the
electrolyte
endeavouring
to
render
the
play
of
its
atoms
visible
to
his
mental
eye
he
had
no
doubt
that
in
this
case
what
is
called
electric
current
was
propagated
from
particle
to
particle
of
the
electrolyte
he
accepted
the
doctrine
of
decomposition
and
recomposition
which
according
to
grothuss
and
davy
ran
from
electrode
to
electrode
and
the
thought
impressed
him
more
and
more
that
ordinary
electric
induction
was
also
transmitted
and
sustained
by
the
action
of
particles
his
first
great
paper
on
frictional
electricity
was
sent
to
the
royal
society
on
november
we
here
find
him
face
to
face
with
an
idea
which
beset
his
mind
throughout
his
whole
subsequent
life
the
idea
of
action
at
a
distance
it
perplexed
and
bewildered
him
in
his
attempts
to
get
rid
of
this
perplexity
he
was
often
unconsciously
rebelling
against
the
limitations
of
the
intellect
itself
he
loved
to
quote
newton
upon
this
point
over
and
over
again
he
introduces
his
memorable
words
gravity
should
be
innate
inherent
and
essential
to
matter
so
that
one
body
may
act
upon
another
at
a
distance
through
a
vacuum
and
without
the
mediation
of
anything
else
by
and
through
which
this
action
and
force
may
be
conveyed
from
one
to
another
is
to
me
so
great
an
absurdity
that
i
believe
no
man
who
has
in
philosophical
matters
a
competent
faculty
of
thinking
can
ever
fall
into
it
gravity
must
be
caused
by
an
agent
acting
constantly
according
to
certain
laws
but
whether
this
agent
be
material
or
immaterial
i
have
left
to
the
consideration
of
my
readers
faraday
does
not
see
the
same
difficulty
in
his
contiguous
particles
and
yet
by
transferring
the
conception
from
masses
to
particles
we
simply
lessen
size
and
distance
but
we
do
not
alter
the
quality
of
the
conception
whatever
difficulty
the
mind
experiences
in
conceiving
of
action
at
sensible
distances
besets
it
also
when
it
attempts
to
conceive
of
action
at
insensible
distances
still
the
investigation
of
the
point
whether
electric
and
magnetic
effects
were
wrought
out
through
the
intervention
of
contiguous
particles
or
not
had
a
physical
interest
altogether
apart
from
the
metaphysical
difficulty
faraday
grapples
with
the
subject
experimentally
by
simple
intuition
he
sees
that
action
at
a
distance
must
be
exerted
in
straight
lines
gravity
he
knows
will
not
turn
a
corner
but
exerts
its
pull
along
a
right
line
hence
his
aim
and
effort
to
ascertain
whether
electric
action
ever
takes
place
in
curved
lines
this
once
proved
it
would
follow
that
the
action
is
carried
on
by
means
of
a
medium
surrounding
the
electrified
bodies
his
experiments
in
reduced
in
his
opinion
this
point
of
demonstration
he
then
found
that
he
could
electrify
by
induction
an
insulated
sphere
placed
completely
in
the
shadow
of
a
body
which
screened
it
from
direct
action
he
pictured
the
lines
of
electric
force
bending
round
the
edges
of
the
screen
and
reuniting
on
the
other
side
of
it
and
he
proved
that
in
many
cases
the
augmentation
of
the
distance
between
his
insulated
sphere
and
the
inducing
body
instead
of
lessening
increased
the
charge
of
the
sphere
this
he
ascribed
to
the
coalescence
of
the
lines
of
electric
force
at
some
distance
behind
the
screen
faraday
theoretic
views
on
this
subject
have
not
received
general
acceptance
but
they
drove
him
to
experiment
and
experiment
with
him
was
always
prolific
of
results
by
suitable
arrangements
he
placed
a
metallic
sphere
in
the
middle
of
a
large
hollow
sphere
leaving
a
space
of
something
more
than
half
an
inch
between
them
the
interior
sphere
was
insulated
the
external
one
uninsulated
to
the
former
he
communicated
a
definite
charge
of
electricity
it
acted
by
induction
upon
the
concave
surface
of
the
latter
and
he
examined
how
this
act
of
induction
was
effected
by
placing
insulators
of
various
kinds
between
the
two
spheres
he
tried
gases
liquids
and
solids
but
the
solids
alone
gave
him
positive
results
he
constructed
two
instruments
of
the
foregoing
description
equal
in
size
and
similar
in
form
the
interior
sphere
of
each
communicated
with
the
external
air
by
a
brass
stem
ending
in
a
knob
the
apparatus
was
virtually
a
leyden
jar
the
two
coatings
of
which
were
the
two
spheres
with
a
thick
and
variable
insulator
between
them
the
amount
of
charge
in
each
jar
was
determined
by
bringing
a
into
contact
with
its
knob
and
measuring
by
a
torsion
balance
the
charge
taken
away
he
first
charged
one
of
his
instruments
and
then
dividing
the
charge
with
the
other
found
that
when
air
intervened
in
both
cases
the
charge
was
equally
divided
but
when
shellac
sulphur
or
spermaceti
was
interposed
between
the
two
spheres
of
one
jar
while
air
occupied
this
interval
in
the
other
then
he
found
that
the
instrument
occupied
by
the
dielectric
takes
more
than
half
the
original
charge
a
portion
of
the
charge
was
absorbed
by
the
dielectric
itself
the
electricity
took
time
to
penetrate
the
dielectric
immediately
after
the
discharge
of
the
apparatus
no
trace
of
electricity
was
found
upon
its
knob
but
after
a
time
electricity
was
found
there
the
charge
having
gradually
returned
from
the
dielectric
in
which
it
had
been
lodged
different
insulators
possess
this
power
of
permitting
the
charge
to
enter
them
in
different
degrees
faraday
figured
their
particles
as
polarized
and
he
concluded
that
the
force
of
induction
is
propagated
from
particle
to
particle
of
the
dielectric
from
the
inner
sphere
to
the
outer
one
this
power
of
propagation
possessed
by
insulators
he
called
their
inductive
capacity
faraday
visualizes
with
the
utmost
clearness
the
state
of
his
contiguous
particles
one
after
another
they
become
charged
each
succeeding
particle
depending
for
its
charge
upon
its
predecessor
and
now
he
seeks
to
break
down
the
wall
of
partition
between
conductors
and
insulators
we
not
he
says
a
gradual
chain
of
association
carry
up
discharge
from
its
occurrence
in
air
through
spermaceti
and
water
to
solutions
and
then
on
to
chlorides
oxides
and
metals
without
any
essential
change
in
its
character
even
copper
he
urges
offers
a
resistance
to
the
transmission
of
electricity
the
action
of
its
particles
differs
from
those
of
an
insulator
only
in
degree
they
are
charged
like
the
particles
of
the
insulator
but
they
discharge
with
greater
ease
and
rapidity
and
this
rapidity
of
molecular
discharge
is
what
we
call
conduction
conduction
then
is
always
preceded
by
atomic
induction
and
when
through
some
quality
of
the
body
which
faraday
does
not
define
the
atomic
discharge
is
rendered
slow
and
difficult
conduction
passes
into
insulation
though
they
are
often
obscure
a
fine
vein
of
philosophic
thought
runs
through
those
investigations
the
mind
of
the
philosopher
dwells
amid
those
agencies
which
underlie
the
visible
phenomena
of
induction
and
conduction
and
he
tries
by
the
strong
light
of
his
imagination
to
see
the
very
molecules
of
his
dielectrics
it
would
however
be
easy
to
criticise
these
researches
easy
to
show
the
looseness
and
sometimes
the
inaccuracy
of
the
phraseology
employed
but
this
critical
spirit
will
get
little
good
out
of
faraday
rather
let
those
who
ponder
his
works
seek
to
realise
the
object
he
set
before
him
not
permitting
his
occasional
vagueness
to
interfere
with
their
appreciation
of
his
speculations
we
may
see
the
ripples
and
eddies
and
vortices
of
a
flowing
stream
without
being
able
to
resolve
all
these
motions
into
their
constituent
elements
and
so
it
sometimes
strikes
me
that
faraday
clearly
saw
the
play
of
fluids
and
ethers
and
atoms
though
his
previous
training
did
not
enable
him
to
resolve
what
he
saw
into
its
constituents
or
describe
it
in
a
manner
satisfactory
to
a
mind
versed
in
mechanics
and
then
again
occur
i
confess
dark
sayings
difficult
to
be
understood
which
disturb
my
confidence
in
this
conclusion
it
must
however
always
be
remembered
that
he
works
at
the
very
boundaries
of
our
knowledge
and
that
his
mind
habitually
dwells
in
the
contiguity
of
shade
by
which
that
knowledge
is
surrounded
in
the
researches
now
under
review
the
ratio
of
speculation
and
reasoning
to
experiment
is
far
higher
than
in
any
of
faraday
previous
works
amid
much
that
is
entangled
and
dark
we
have
flashes
of
wondrous
insight
and
utterances
which
seem
less
the
product
of
reasoning
than
of
revelation
i
will
confine
myself
here
to
one
example
of
this
divining
power
by
his
most
ingenious
device
of
a
rapidly
rotating
mirror
wheatstone
had
proved
that
electricity
required
time
to
pass
through
a
wire
the
current
reaching
the
middle
of
the
wire
later
than
its
two
ends
says
faraday
two
ends
of
the
wire
in
professor
wheatstone
experiments
were
immediately
connected
with
two
large
insulated
metallic
surfaces
exposed
to
the
air
so
that
the
primary
act
of
induction
after
making
the
contact
for
discharge
might
be
in
part
removed
from
the
internal
portion
of
the
wire
at
the
first
instance
and
disposed
for
the
moment
on
its
surface
jointly
with
the
air
and
surrounding
conductors
then
i
venture
to
anticipate
that
the
middle
spark
would
be
more
retarded
than
before
and
if
those
two
plates
were
the
inner
and
outer
coatings
of
a
large
jar
or
leyden
battery
then
the
retardation
of
the
spark
would
be
much
greater
this
was
only
a
prediction
for
the
experiment
was
not
made
sixteen
years
subsequently
however
the
proper
conditions
came
into
play
and
faraday
was
able
to
show
that
the
observations
of
werner
siemens
and
latimer
clark
on
subterraneous
and
submarine
wires
were
illustrations
on
a
grand
scale
of
the
principle
which
he
had
enunciated
in
the
wires
and
the
surrounding
water
act
as
a
leyden
jar
and
the
retardation
of
the
current
predicted
by
faraday
manifests
itself
in
every
message
sent
by
such
cables
the
meaning
of
faraday
in
these
memoirs
on
induction
and
conduction
is
as
i
have
said
by
no
means
always
clear
and
the
difficulty
will
be
most
felt
by
those
who
are
best
trained
in
ordinary
theoretic
conceptions
he
does
not
know
the
reader
needs
and
he
therefore
does
not
meet
them
for
instance
he
speaks
over
and
over
again
of
the
impossibility
of
charging
a
body
with
one
electricity
though
the
impossibility
is
by
no
means
evident
the
key
to
the
difficulty
is
this
he
looks
upon
every
insulated
conductor
as
the
inner
coating
of
a
leyden
jar
an
insulated
sphere
in
the
middle
of
a
room
is
to
his
mind
such
a
coating
the
walls
are
the
outer
coating
while
the
air
between
both
is
the
insulator
across
which
the
charge
acts
by
induction
without
this
reaction
of
the
walls
upon
the
sphere
you
could
no
more
according
to
faraday
charge
it
with
electricity
than
you
could
charge
a
leyden
jar
if
its
outer
coating
were
removed
distance
with
him
is
immaterial
his
strength
as
a
generalizer
enables
him
to
dissolve
the
idea
of
magnitude
and
if
you
abolish
the
walls
of
the
room
even
the
earth
itself
he
would
make
the
sun
and
planets
the
outer
coating
of
his
jar
i
dare
not
contend
that
faraday
in
these
memoirs
made
all
his
theoretic
positions
good
but
a
pure
vein
of
philosophy
runs
through
these
writings
while
his
experiments
and
reasonings
on
the
forms
and
phenomena
of
electrical
discharge
are
of
imperishable
importance

never

now
feeling
the
effects
of
the

which
he
had
been
subjected
for
so
many
years
during
these
years
he
repeatedly
broke
down
his

alone
witnessed
the
extent
of
his
prostration
and
to
her
loving
care
we
and
the
world
are
indebted
for
the
enjoyment
of
his
presence
here
so
long
he
found
occasional
relief
in
a
theatre
he
frequently
quitted
london
and
went
to
brighton
and
elsewhere
always
choosing
a
situation
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
sea
or
of
some
other
pleasant
horizon
where
he
could
sit
and
gaze
and
feel
the
gradual
revival
of
the
faith
that
never
did
betray
the
heart
that
loved
her
but
very
often
for
some
days
after
his
removal
to
the
country
he
would
be
unable
to
do
more
than
sit
at
a
window
and
look
out
upon
the
sea
and
sky
in
his
state
became
more
serious
than
it
had
ever
been
before
a
published
letter
to
richard
taylor
dated
march
contains
an
allusion
to
his
previous
condition
are
aware
he
says
considerations
regarding
health
have
prevented
me
from
working
or
reading
on
science
for
the
last
two
years
this
at
one
period
or
another
of
their
lives
seems
to
be
the
fate
of
most
great
investigators
they
do
not
know
the
limits
of
their
constitutional
strength
until
they
have
transgressed
them
it
is
perhaps
right
that
they
should
transgress
them
in
order
to
ascertain
where
they
lie
faraday
however
though
he
went
far
towards
it
did
not
push
his
transgression
beyond
his
power
of
restitution
in
faraday
and
he
went
to
switzerland
under
the
affectionate
charge
of
her
brother
george
barnard
the
artist
this
time
of
suffering
throws
fresh
light
upon
his
character
i
have
said
that
sweetness
and
gentleness
were
not
its
only
constituents
that
he
was
also
fiery
and
strong
at
the
time
now
referred
to
his
fire
was
low
and
his
strength
distilled
away
but
the
residue
of
his
life
was
neither
irritability
nor
discontent
he
was
unfit
to
mingle
in
society
for
conversation
was
a
pain
to
him
but
let
us
observe
the
great
when
alone
he
is
at
the
village
of
interlaken
enjoying
jungfrau
sunsets
and
at
times
watching
the
swiss
nailers
making
their
nails
he
keeps
a
little
journal
in
which
he
describes
the
process
of
nailmaking
and
incidentally
throws
a
luminous
beam
upon
himself
clout
nailmaking
goes
on
here
rather
considerably
and
is
a
very
neat
and
pretty
operation
to
observe
i
love
a
smith
shop
and
anything
relating
to
smithery
my
father
was
a
smith
from
interlaken
he
went
to
the
falls
of
the
giessbach
on
the
pleasant
lake
of
brientz
and
here
we
have
him
watching
the
shoot
of
the
cataract
down
its
series
of
precipices
it
is
shattered
into
foam
at
the
base
of
each
and
tossed
by
its
own
recoil
as
through
the
air
the
sun
is
at
his
back
shining
on
the
drifting
spray
and
he
thus
describes
and
muses
on
what
he
sees
every
fall
was
foaming
from
the
abundance
of
water
and
the
current
of
wind
brought
down
by
it
was
in
some
places
too
strong
to
stand
against
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
the
rainbows
seen
from
various
points
were
very
beautiful
one
at
the
bottom
of
a
fine
but
furious
fall
was
very
pleasant
there
it
remained
motionless
whilst
the
gusts
and
clouds
of
spray
swept
furiously
across
its
place
and
were
dashed
against
the
rock
it
looked
like
a
spirit
strong
in
faith
and
steadfast
in
the
midst
of
the
storm
of
passions
sweeping
across
it
and
though
it
might
fade
and
revive
still
it
held
on
to
the
rock
as
in
hope
and
giving
hope
and
the
very
drops
which
in
the
whirlwind
of
their
fury
seemed
as
if
they
would
carry
all
away
were
made
to
revive
it
and
give
it
greater
beauty

we
must
quit
the
man
and
go

the
discoverer
we
shall
return
for
a
brief
space
to
his
company
carry
your
thoughts
back
to
his
last
experiments
and
see
him
endeavouring
to
prove
that
induction
is
due
to
the
action
of
contiguous
particles
he
knew
that
polarized
light
was
a
most
subtle
and
delicate
investigator
of
molecular
condition
he
used
it
in
in
exploring
his
electrolytes
and
he
tried
it
in
upon
his
dielectrics
at
that
time
he
coated
two
opposite
faces
of
a
glass
cube
with
tinfoil
connected
one
coating
with
his
powerful
electric
machine
and
the
other
with
the
earth
and
examined
by
polarized
light
the
condition
of
the
glass
when
thus
subjected
to
strong
electric
influence
he
failed
to
obtain
any
effect
still
he
was
persuaded
an
action
existed
and
required
only
suitable
means
to
call
it
forth
after
his
return
from
switzerland
he
was
beset
by
these
thoughts
they
were
more
inspired
than
logical
but
he
resorted
to
magnets
and
proved
his
inspiration
true
his
dislike
of
knowledge
and
his
efforts
to
liberate
his
mind
from
the
thraldom
of
hypotheses
have
been
already
referred
to
still
this
rebel
against
theory
was
incessantly
theorising
himself
his
principal
researches
are
all
connected
by
an
undercurrent
of
speculation
theoretic
ideas
were
the
very
sap
of
his
intellect
the
source
from
which
all
his
strength
as
an
experimenter
was
derived
while
once
sauntering
with
him
through
the
crystal
palace
at
sydenham
i
asked
him
what
directed
his
attention
to
the
magnetization
of
light
it
was
his
theoretic
notions
he
had
certain
views
regarding
the
unity
and
convertibility
of
natural
forces
certain
ideas
regarding
the
vibrations
of
light
and
their
relations
to
the
lines
of
magnetic
force
these
views
and
ideas
drove
him
to
investigation
and
so
it
must
always
be
the
great
experimentalist
must
ever
be
the
habitual
theorist

or
not

to
his

informed
endeavoured
to
improve
the
manufacture
of
glass
for
optical
purposes
but
though
he
produced
a
heavy
glass
of
great
refractive
power
its
value
to
optics
did
not
repay
him
for
the
pains
and
labour
bestowed
on
it
now
however
we
reach
a
result
established
by
means
of
this
same
heavy
glass
which
made
ample
amends
for
all
in
november
he
announced
his
discovery
of
the
of
light
and
the
illumination
of
the
lines
of
magnetic
force
this
title
provoked
comment
at
the
time
and
caused
misapprehension
he
therefore
added
an
explanatory
note
but
the
note
left
his
meaning
as
entangled
as
before
in
fact
faraday
had
notions
regarding
the
magnetization
of
light
which
were
peculiar
to
himself
and
untranslatable
into
the
scientific
language
of
the
time
probably
no
other
philosopher
of
his
day
would
have
employed
the
phrases
just
quoted
as
appropriate
to
the
discovery
announced
in
but
faraday
was
more
than
a
philosopher
he
was
a
prophet
and
often
wrought
by
an
inspiration
to
be
understood
by
sympathy
alone
the
prophetic
element
in
his
character
occasionally
coloured
and
even
injured
the
utterance
of
the
man
of
science
but
subtracting
that
element
though
you
might
have
conferred
on
him
intellectual
symmetry
you
would
have
destroyed
his
motive
force
but
let
us
pass
from
the
label
of
this
casket
to
the
jewel
it
contains
have
long
he
says
an
opinion
almost
amounting
to
conviction
in
common
i
believe
with
many
other
lovers
of
natural
knowledge
that
the
various
forms
under
which
the
forces
of
matter
are
made
manifest
have
one
common
origin
in
other
words
are
so
directly
related
and
mutually
dependent
that
they
are
convertible
as
it
were
into
one
another
and
possess
equivalents
of
power
in
their
action
this
strong
persuasion
he
adds
to
the
powers
of
light
and
then
he
examines
the
action
of
magnets
upon
light
from
conversation
with
him
and
anderson
i
should
infer
that
the
labour
preceding
this
discovery
was
very
great
the
world
knows
little
of
the
toil
of
the
discoverer
it
sees
the
climber
jubilant
on
the
mountain
top
but
does
not
know
the
labour
expended
in
reaching
it
probably
hundreds
of
experiments
had
been
made
on
transparent
crystals
before
he
thought
of
testing
his
heavy
glass
here
is
his
own
clear
and
simple
description
of
the
result
of
his
first
experiment
with
this
substance

of
this
glass
about
two
inches
square
and
of
an
inch
thick
having
flat
and
polished
edges
was
placed
as
a
diamagnetic
between
the
poles
not
as
yet
magnetized
by
the
electric
current
so
that
the
polarized
ray
should
pass
through
its
length
the
glass
acted
as
air
water
or
any
other
transparent
substance
would
do
and
if
the
were
previously
turned
into
such
a
position
that
the
polarized
ray
was
extinguished
or
rather
the
image
produced
by
it
rendered
invisible
then
the
introduction
of
the
glass
made
no
alteration
in
this
respect
in
this
state
of
circumstances
the
force
of
the
was
developed
by
sending
an
electric
current
through
its
coils
and
immediately
the
image
of
the
became
visible
and
continued
so
as
long
as
the
arrangement
continued
magnetic
on
stopping
the
electric
current
and
so
causing
the
magnetic
force
to
cease
the
light
instantly
disappeared
these
phenomena
could
be
renewed
at
pleasure
at
any
instant
of
time
and
upon
any
occasion
showing
a
perfect
dependence
of
cause
and
effect
in
a
beam
of
ordinary
light
the
particles
of
the
luminiferous
ether
vibrate
in
all
directions
perpendicular
to
the
line
of
progression
by
the
act
of
polarization
performed
here
by
faraday
all
oscillations
but
those
parallel
to
a
certain
plane
are
eliminated
when
the
plane
of
vibration
of
the
polarizer
coincides
with
that
of
the
analyzer
a
portion
of
the
beam
passes
through
both
but
when
these
two
planes
are
at
right
angles
to
each
other
the
beam
is
extinguished
if
by
any
means
while
the
polarizer
and
analyzer
remain
thus
crossed
the
plane
of
vibration
of
the
polarized
beam
between
them
could
be
changed
then
the
light
would
be
in
part
at
least
transmitted
in
experiment
this
was
accomplished
his
magnet
turned
the
plane
of
polarization
of
the
beam
through
a
certain
angle
and
thus
enabled
it
to
get
through
the
analyzer
so
that
magnetization
of
light
and
the
illumination
of
the
magnetic
lines
of
force
becomes
when
expressed
in
the
language
of
modern
theory
the
rotation
of
the
plane
of
polarization
to
him
as
to
all
true
philosophers
the
main
value
of
a
fact
was
its
position
and
suggestiveness
in
the
general
sequence
of
scientific
truth
hence
having
established
the
existence
of
a
phenomenon
his
habit
was
to
look
at
it
from
all
possible
points
of
view
and
to
develop
its
relationship
to
other
phenomena
he
proved
that
the
direction
of
the
rotation
depends
upon
the
polarity
of
his
magnet
being
reversed
when
the
magnetic
poles
are
reversed
he
showed
that
when
a
polarized
ray
passed
through
his
heavy
glass
in
a
direction
parallel
to
the
magnetic
lines
of
force
the
rotation
is
a
maximum
and
that
when
the
direction
of
the
ray
is
at
right
angles
to
the
lines
of
force
there
is
no
rotation
at
all
he
also
proved
that
the
amount
of
the
rotation
is
proportional
to
the
length
of
the
diamagnetic
through
which
the
ray
passes
he
operated
with
liquids
and
solutions
of
aqueous
solutions
he
tried
and
more
and
found
the
power
in
all
of
them
he
then
examined
gases
but
here
all
his
efforts
to
produce
any
sensible
action
upon
the
polarized
beam
were
ineffectual
he
then
passed
from
magnets
to
currents
enclosing
bars
of
heavy
glass
and
tubes
containing
liquids
and
aqueous
solutions
within
an
helix
a
current
sent
through
the
helix
caused
the
plane
of
polarization
to
rotate
and
always
in
the
direction
of
the
current
the
rotation
was
reversed
when
the
current
was
reversed
in
the
case
of
magnets
he
observed
a
gradual
though
quick
ascent
of
the
transmitted
beam
from
a
state
of
darkness
to
its
maximum
brilliancy
when
the
magnet
was
excited
in
the
case
of
currents
the
beam
attained
at
once
its
maximum
this
he
showed
to
be
due
to
the
time
required
by
the
iron
of
the
to
assume
its
full
magnetic
power
which
time
vanishes
when
a
current
without
iron
is
employed
this
experiment
he
says
may
i
think
justly
say
that
a
ray
of
light
is
electrified
and
the
electric
forces
illuminated
in
the
helix
as
with
the
magnets
he
submitted
air
to
magnetic
influence
and
anxiously
but
could
not
discover
any
trace
of
action
on
the
polarized
ray
many
substances
possess
the
power
of
turning
the
plane
of
polarization
without
the
intervention
of
magnetism
oil
of
turpentine
and
quartz
are
examples
but
faraday
showed
that
while
in
one
direction
that
is
across
the
lines
of
magnetic
force
his
rotation
is
zero
augmenting
gradually
from
this
until
it
attains
its
maximum
when
the
direction
of
the
ray
is
parallel
to
the
lines
of
force
in
the
oil
of
turpentine
the
rotation
is
independent
of
the
direction
of
the
ray
but
he
showed
that
a
still
more
profound
distinction
exists
between
the
magnetic
rotation
and
the
natural
one
i
will
try
to
explain
how
suppose
a
tube
with
glass
ends
containing
oil
of
turpentine
to
be
placed
north
and
south
fixing
the
eye
at
the
south
end
of
the
tube
let
a
polarized
beam
be
sent
through
it
from
the
north
to
the
observer
in
this
position
the
rotation
of
the
plane
of
polarization
by
the
turpentine
is
let
the
eye
be
placed
at
the
north
end
of
the
tube
and
a
beam
be
sent
through
it
from
the
south
the
rotation
is
still
not
so
however
when
a
bar
of
heavy
glass
is
subjected
to
the
action
of
an
electric
current
in
this
case
if
in
the
first
position
of
the
eye
the
rotation
be
in
the
second
position
it
is
these
considerations
make
it
manifest
that
if
a
polarized
beam
after
having
passed
through
the
oil
of
turpentine
in
its
natural
state
could
by
any
means
be
reflected
back
through
the
liquid
the
rotation
impressed
upon
the
direct
beam
would
be
exactly
neutralized
by
that
impressed
upon
the
reflected
one
not
so
with
the
induced
magnetic
effect
here
it
is
manifest
that
the
rotation
would
be
doubled
by
the
act
of
reflection
hence
faraday
concludes
that
the
particles
of
the
oil
of
turpentine
which
rotate
by
virtue
of
their
natural
force
and
those
which
rotate
in
virtue
of
the
induced
force
can
not
be
in
the
same
condition
the
same
remark
applies
to
all
bodies
which
possess
a
natural
power
of
rotating
the
plane
of
polarization
and
then
he
proceeded
with
exquisite
skill
and
insight
to
take
advantage
of
this
conclusion
he
silvered
the
ends
of
his
piece
of
heavy
glass
leaving
however
a
narrow
portion
parallel
to
two
edges
diagonally
opposed
to
each
other
unsilvered
he
then
sent
his
beam
through
this
uncovered
portion
and
by
suitably
inclining
his
glass
caused
the
beam
within
it
to
reach
his
eye
first
direct
and
then
after
two
four
and
six
reflections
these
corresponded
to
the
passage
of
the
ray
once
three
times
five
times
and
seven
times
through
the
glass
he
thus
established
with
numerical
accuracy
the
exact
proportionality
of
the
rotation
to
the
distance
traversed
by
the
polarized
beam
thus
in
one
series
of
experiments
where
the
rotation
required
by
the
direct
beam
was
that
acquired
by
three
passages
through
the
glass
was
while
that
acquired
by
five
passages
was
but
even
when
this
method
of
magnifying
was
applied
he
failed
with
various
solid
substances
to
obtain
any
effect
and
in
the
case
of
air
though
he
employed
to
the
utmost
the
power
which
these
repeated
reflections
placed
in
his
hands
he
failed
to
produce
the
slightest
sensible
rotation
these
failures
of
faraday
to
obtain
the
effect
with
gases
seem
to
indicate
the
true
seat
of
the
phenomenon
the
luminiferous
ether
surrounds
and
is
influenced
by
the
ultimate
particles
of
matter
the
symmetry
of
the
one
involves
that
of
the
other
thus
if
the
molecules
of
a
crystal
be
perfectly
symmetrical
round
any
line
through
the
crystal
we
may
safely
conclude
that
a
ray
will
pass
along
this
line
as
through
ordinary
glass
it
will
not
be
doubly
refracted
from
the
symmetry
of
the
liquid
figures
known
to
be
produced
in
the
planes
of
freezing
when
radiant
heat
is
sent
through
ice
we
may
safely
infer
symmetry
of
aggregation
and
hence
conclude
that
the
line
perpendicular
to
the
planes
of
freezing
is
a
line
of
no
double
refraction
that
it
is
in
fact
the
optic
axis
of
the
crystal
the
same
remark
applies
to
the
line
joining
the
opposite
blunt
angles
of
a
crystal
of
iceland
spar
the
arrangement
of
the
molecules
round
this
line
being
symmetrical
the
condition
of
the
ether
depending
upon
these
molecules
shares
their
symmetry
and
there
is
therefore
no
reason
why
the
wavelength
should
alter
with
the
alteration
of
the
azimuth
round
this
line
annealed
glass
has
its
molecules
symmetrically
arranged
round
every
line
that
can
be
drawn
through
it
hence
it
is
not
doubly
refractive
but
let
the
substance
be
either
squeezed
or
strained
in
one
direction
the
molecular
symmetry
and
with
it
the
symmetry
of
the
ether
is
immediately
destroyed
and
the
glass
becomes
doubly
refractive
unequal
heating
produces
the
same
effect
thus
mechanical
strains
reveal
themselves
by
optical
effects
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
in
faraday
experiment
it
is
the
magnetic
strain
that
produces
the
rotation
of
the
plane
of
polarization

discovery
of

researches
on
action
faraday
next
great
step
in
discovery
was
announced
in
a
memoir
on
the
condition
of
all
matter
communicated
to
the
royal
society
on
december
one
great
source
of
his
success
was
the
employment
of
extraordinary
power
as
already
stated
he
never
accepted
a
negative
answer
to
an
experiment
until
he
had
brought
to
bear
upon
it
all
the
force
at
his
command
he
had
over
and
over
again
tried
steel
magnets
and
ordinary
on
various
substances
but
without
detecting
anything
different
from
the
ordinary
attraction
exhibited
by
a
few
of
them
stronger
coercion
however
developed
a
new
action
before
the
pole
of
an
he
suspended
a
fragment
of
his
famous
heavy
glass
and
observed
that
when
the
magnet
was
powerfully
excited
the
glass
fairly
retreated
from
the
pole
it
was
a
clear
case
of
magnetic
repulsion
he
then
suspended
a
bar
of
the
glass
between
two
poles
the
bar
retreated
when
the
poles
were
excited
and
set
its
length
equatorially
or
at
right
angles
to
the
line
joining
them
when
an
ordinary
magnetic
body
was
similarly
suspended
it
always
set
axially
that
is
from
pole
to
pole
faraday
called
those
bodies
which
were
repelled
by
the
poles
of
a
magnet
diamagnetic
bodies
using
this
term
in
a
sense
different
from
that
in
which
he
employed
it
in
his
memoir
on
the
magnetization
of
light
the
term
magnetic
he
reserved
for
bodies
which
exhibited
the
ordinary
attraction
he
afterwards
employed
the
term
magnetic
to
cover
the
whole
phenomena
of
attraction
and
repulsion
and
used
the
word
paramagnetic
to
designate
such
magnetic
action
as
is
exhibited
by
iron
isolated
observations
by
brugmanns
becquerel
le
baillif
saigy
and
seebeck
had
indicated
the
existence
of
a
repulsive
force
exercised
by
the
magnet
on
two
or
three
substances
but
these
observations
which
were
unknown
to
faraday
had
been
permitted
to
remain
without
extension
or
examination
having
laid
hold
of
the
fact
of
repulsion
faraday
immediately
expanded
and
multiplied
it
he
subjected
bodies
of
the
most
varied
qualities
to
the
action
of
his
magnet
mineral
salts
acids
alkalis
ethers
alcohols
aqueous
solutions
glass
phosphorus
resins
oils
essences
vegetable
and
animal
tissues
and
found
them
all
amenable
to
magnetic
influence
no
known
solid
or
liquid
proved
insensible
to
the
magnetic
power
when
developed
in
sufficient
strength
all
the
tissues
of
the
human
body
the
blood
though
it
contains
iron
included
were
proved
to
be
diamagnetic
so
that
if
you
could
suspend
a
man
between
the
poles
of
a
magnet
his
extremities
would
retreat
from
the
poles
until
his
length
became
equatorial
soon
after
he
had
commenced
his
researches
on
diamagnetism
faraday
noticed
a
remarkable
phenomenon
which
first
crossed
my
own
path
in
the
following
way
in
the
year
while
working
in
the
cabinet
of
my
friend
professor
knoblauch
of
marburg
i
suspended
a
small
copper
coin
between
the
poles
of
an
on
exciting
the
magnet
the
coin
moved
towards
the
poles
and
then
suddenly
stopped
as
if
it
had
struck
against
a
cushion
on
breaking
the
circuit
the
coin
was
repelled
the
revulsion
being
so
violent
as
to
cause
it
to
spin
several
times
round
its
axis
of
suspension
a
similarly
suspended
exhibited
the
same
deportment
for
a
moment
i
thought
this
a
new
discovery
but
on
looking
over
the
literature
of
the
subject
it
appeared
that
faraday
had
observed
multiplied
and
explained
the
same
effect
during
his
researches
on
diamagnetism
his
explanation
was
based
upon
his
own
great
discovery
of
currents
the
effect
is
a
most
singular
one
a
weight
of
several
pounds
of
copper
may
be
set
spinning
between
the
poles
the
excitement
of
the
magnet
instantly
stops
the
rotation
though
nothing
is
apparent
to
the
eye
the
copper
if
moved
in
the
excited
magnetic
field
appears
to
move
through
a
viscous
fluid
while
when
a
flat
piece
of
the
metal
is
caused
to
pass
to
and
fro
like
a
saw
between
the
poles
the
sawing
of
the
magnetic
field
resembles
the
cutting
through
of
cheese
or
butter
this
virtual
friction
of
the
magnetic
field
is
so
strong
that
copper
by
its
rapid
rotation
between
the
poles
might
probably
be
fused
we
may
easily
dismiss
this
experiment
by
saying
that
the
heat
is
due
to
the
electric
currents
excited
in
the
copper
but
so
long
as
we
are
unable
to
reply
to
the
question
is
an
electric
current
the
explanation
is
only
provisional
for
my
own
part
i
look
with
profound
interest
and
hope
on
the
strange
action
here
referred
to
faraday
thoughts
ran
intuitively
into
experimental
combinations
so
that
subjects
whose
capacity
for
experimental
treatment
would
to
ordinary
minds
seem
to
be
exhausted
in
a
moment
were
shown
by
him
to
be
all
but
inexhaustible
he
has
now
an
object
in
view
the
first
step
towards
which
is
the
proof
that
the
principle
of
archimedes
is
true
of
magnetism
he
forms
magnetic
solutions
of
various
degrees
of
strength
places
them
between
the
poles
of
his
magnet
and
suspends
in
the
solutions
various
magnetic
bodies
he
proves
that
when
the
solution
is
stronger
than
the
body
plunged
in
it
the
body
though
magnetic
is
repelled
and
when
an
elongated
piece
of
it
is
surrounded
by
the
solution
it
sets
like
a
diamagnetic
body
equatorially
between
the
excited
poles
the
same
body
when
suspended
in
a
solution
of
weaker
magnetic
power
than
itself
is
attracted
as
a
whole
while
an
elongated
portion
of
it
sets
axially
and
now
theoretic
questions
rush
in
upon
him
is
this
new
force
a
true
repulsion
or
is
it
merely
a
differential
attraction
might
not
the
apparent
repulsion
of
diamagnetic
bodies
be
really
due
to
the
greater
attraction
of
the
medium
by
which
they
are
surrounded
he
tries
the
rarefaction
of
air
but
finds
the
effect
insensible
he
is
averse
to
ascribing
a
capacity
of
attraction
to
space
or
to
any
hypothetical
medium
supposed
to
fill
space
he
therefore
inclines
but
still
with
caution
to
the
opinion
that
the
action
of
a
magnet
upon
bismuth
is
a
true
and
absolute
repulsion
and
not
merely
the
result
of
differential
attraction
and
then
he
clearly
states
a
theoretic
view
sufficient
to
account
for
the
phenomena
he
says
explanation
of
the
movements
of
the
diamagnetic
bodies
and
all
the
dynamic
phenomena
consequent
upon
the
action
of
magnets
upon
them
might
be
offered
in
the
supposition
that
magnetic
induction
caused
in
them
a
contrary
state
to
that
which
it
produced
in
ordinary
matter
that
is
to
say
while
in
ordinary
magnetic
influence
the
exciting
pole
excites
adjacent
to
itself
the
contrary
magnetism
in
diamagnetic
bodies
the
adjacent
magnetism
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
exciting
pole
this
theory
of
reversed
polarity
however
does
not
appear
to
have
ever
laid
deep
hold
of
faraday
mind
and
his
own
experiments
failed
to
give
any
evidence
of
its
truth
he
therefore
subsequently
abandoned
it
and
maintained
the
of
the
diamagnetic
force
he
then
entered
a
new
though
related
field
of
inquiry
having
dealt
with
the
metals
and
their
compounds
and
having
classified
all
of
them
that
came
within
the
range
of
his
observation
under
the
two
heads
magnetic
and
diamagnetic
he
began
the
investigation
of
the
phenomena
presented
by
crystals
when
subjected
to
magnetic
power
this
action
of
crystals
had
been
in
part
theoretically
predicted
by
poisson
and
actually
discovered
by
plucker
whose
beautiful
results
at
the
period
which
we
have
now
reached
profoundly
interested
all
scientific
men
faraday
had
been
frequently
puzzled
by
the
deportment
of
bismuth
a
highly
crystalline
metal
sometimes
elongated
masses
of
the
substance
refused
to
set
equatorially
sometimes
they
set
persistently
oblique
and
sometimes
even
like
a
magnetic
body
from
pole
to
pole
effect
he
says
at
a
single
pole
and
it
is
then
striking
to
observe
a
long
piece
of
a
substance
so
diamagnetic
as
bismuth
repelled
and
yet
at
the
same
moment
set
round
with
force
axially
or
end
on
as
a
piece
of
magnetic
substance
would
do
the
effect
perplexed
him
and
in
his
efforts
to
release
himself
from
this
perplexity
no
feature
of
this
new
manifestation
of
force
escaped
his
attention
his
experiments
are
described
in
a
memoir
communicated
to
the
royal
society
on
december
i
have
worked
long
myself
at
action
amid
all
the
light
of
faraday
and
plucker
researches
the
papers
now
before
me
were
objects
of
daily
and
nightly
study
with
me
eighteen
or
nineteen
years
ago
but
even
now
though
their
perusal
is
but
the
last
of
a
series
of
repetitions
they
astonish
me
every
circumstance
connected
with
the
subject
every
shade
of
deportment
every
variation
in
the
energy
of
the
action
almost
every
application
which
could
possibly
be
made
of
magnetism
to
bring
out
in
detail
the
character
of
this
new
force
is
minutely
described
the
field
is
swept
clean
and
hardly
anything
experimental
is
left
for
the
gleaner
the
phenomena
he
concludes
are
altogether
different
from
those
of
magnetism
or
diamagnetism
they
would
appear
in
fact
to
present
to
us
new
force
or
a
new
form
of
force
in
the
molecules
of
matter
which
for
convenience
sake
he
designates
by
a
new
word
as
force
he
looks
at
the
crystal
acted
upon
by
the
magnet
from
its
mass
he
passes
in
idea
to
its
atoms
and
he
asks
himself
whether
the
power
which
can
thus
seize
upon
the
crystalline
molecules
after
they
have
been
fixed
in
their
proper
positions
by
crystallizing
force
may
not
when
they
are
free
be
able
to
determine
their
arrangement
he
therefore
liberates
the
atoms
by
fusing
the
bismuth
he
places
the
fused
substance
between
the
poles
of
an
powerfully
excited
but
he
fails
to
detect
any
action
i
think
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
an
action
is
exerted
here
that
a
true
cause
comes
into
play
but
its
magnitude
is
not
such
as
sensibly
to
interfere
with
the
force
of
crystallization
which
in
comparison
with
the
diamagnetic
force
is
enormous
adds
faraday
a
longer
time
were
allowed
and
a
permanent
magnet
used
a
better
result
might
be
obtained
i
had
built
many
hopes
upon
the
process
this
expression
and
his
writings
abound
in
such
illustrates
what
has
been
already
said
regarding
his
experiments
being
suggested
and
guided
by
his
theoretic
conceptions
his
mind
was
full
of
hopes
and
hypotheses
but
he
always
brought
them
to
an
experimental
test
the
record
of
his
planned
and
executed
experiments
would
i
doubt
not
show
a
high
ratio
of
hopes
disappointed
to
hopes
fulfilled
but
every
case
of
fulfilment
abolished
all
memory
of
defeat
disappointment
was
swallowed
up
in
victory
after
the
description
of
the
general
character
of
this
new
force
faraday
states
with
the
emphasis
here
reproduced
its
mode
of
action
law
of
action
appears
to
be
that
the
line
or
axis
of
force
being
the
resultant
of
the
action
of
all
the
molecules
tends
to
place
itself
parallel
or
as
a
tangent
to
the
magnetic
curve
or
line
of
magnetic
force
passing
through
the
place
where
the
crystal
is
situated
the
force
moreover
appears
to
him
be
clearly
distinguished
from
the
magnetic
or
diamagnetic
forces
in
that
it
causes
neither
approach
nor
recession
consisting
not
in
attraction
or
repulsion
but
in
giving
a
certain
determinate
position
to
the
mass
under
its
influence
and
then
he
goes
on
carefully
to
examine
and
prove
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
connection
of
the
force
with
attractive
or
repulsive
influences
with
the
most
refined
ingenuity
he
shows
that
under
certain
circumstances
the
force
can
cause
the
centre
of
gravity
of
a
highly
magnetic
body
to
retreat
from
the
poles
and
the
centre
of
gravity
of
a
highly
diamagnetic
body
to
approach
them
his
experiments
root
his
mind
more
and
more
firmly
in
the
conclusion
that
attraction
nor
repulsion
causes
the
set
or
governs
the
final
position
of
the
crystal
in
the
magnetic
field
that
the
force
which
does
so
is
therefore
in
its
character
and
effects
from
the
magnetic
and
diamagnetic
forms
of
force
on
the
other
hand
he
continues
has
a
most
manifest
relation
to
the
crystalline
structure
of
bismuth
and
other
bodies
and
therefore
to
the
power
by
which
their
molecules
are
able
to
build
up
the
crystalline
masses
and
here
follows
one
of
those
expressions
which
characterize
the
conceptions
of
faraday
in
regard
to
force
generally
appears
to
me
impossible
to
conceive
of
the
results
in
any
other
way
than
by
a
mutual
reaction
of
the
magnetic
force
and
the
force
of
the
particles
of
the
crystals
upon
each
other
he
proves
that
the
action
of
the
force
though
thus
molecular
is
an
action
at
a
distance
he
shows
that
a
bismuth
crystal
can
cause
a
freely
suspended
magnetic
needle
to
set
parallel
to
its
axis
few
living
men
are
aware
of
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
results
like
this
or
of
the
delicacy
necessary
to
their
attainment
though
it
thus
takes
up
the
character
of
a
force
acting
at
a
distance
still
it
is
due
to
that
power
of
the
particles
which
makes
them
cohere
in
regular
order
and
gives
the
mass
its
crystalline
aggregation
which
we
call
at
other
times
the
attraction
of
aggregation
and
so
often
speak
of
as
acting
at
insensible
distances
thus
he
broods
over
this
new
force
and
looks
at
it
from
all
possible
points
of
inspection
experiment
follows
experiment
as
thought
follows
thought
he
will
not
relinquish
the
subject
as
long
as
a
hope
exists
of
throwing
more
light
upon
it
he
knows
full
well
the
anomalous
nature
of
the
conclusion
to
which
his
experiments
lead
him
but
experiment
to
him
is
final
and
he
will
not
shrink
from
the
conclusion
force
he
says
to
me
to
be
very
strange
and
striking
in
its
character
it
is
not
polar
for
there
is
no
attraction
or
repulsion
and
then
as
if
startled
by
his
own
utterance
he
asks
is
the
nature
of
the
mechanical
force
which
turns
the
crystal
round
and
makes
it
affect
a
magnet
do
not
remember
he
continues
such
a
case
of
force
as
the
present
one
where
a
body
is
brought
into
position
only
without
attraction
or
repulsion
plucker
the
celebrated
geometer
already
mentioned
who
pursued
experimental
physics
for
many
years
of
his
life
with
singular
devotion
and
success
visited
faraday
in
those
days
and
repeated
before
him
his
beautiful
experiments
on
action
faraday
repeated
and
verified
plucker
observations
and
concluded
what
he
at
first
seemed
to
doubt
that
plucker
results
and
action
had
the
same
origin
at
the
end
of
his
papers
when
he
takes
a
last
look
along
the
line
of
research
and
then
turns
his
eyes
to
the
future
utterances
quite
as
much
emotional
as
scientific
escape
from
faraday
can
not
he
says
at
the
end
of
his
first
paper
on
action
this
series
of
researches
without
remarking
how
rapidly
the
knowledge
of
molecular
forces
grows
upon
us
and
how
strikingly
every
investigation
tends
to
develop
more
and
more
their
importance
and
their
extreme
attraction
as
an
object
of
study
a
few
years
ago
magnetism
was
to
us
an
occult
power
affecting
only
a
few
bodies
now
it
is
found
to
influence
all
bodies
and
to
possess
the
most
intimate
relations
with
electricity
heat
chemical
action
light
crystallization
and
through
it
with
the
forces
concerned
in
cohesion
and
we
may
in
the
present
state
of
things
well
feel
urged
to
continue
in
our
labours
encouraged
by
the
hope
of
bringing
it
into
a
bond
of
union
with
gravity
itself
supplementary
remarks
a
brief
space
will
perhaps
be
granted
me
here
to
state
the
further
progress
of
an
investigation
which
interested
faraday
so
much
drawn
by
the
fame
of
bunsen
as
a
teacher
in
the
year
i
became
a
student
in
the
university
of
marburg
in
hesse
cassel
bunsen
behaviour
to
me
was
that
of
a
brother
as
well
as
that
of
a
teacher
and
it
was
also
my
happiness
to
make
the
acquaintance
and
gain
the
friendship
of
professor
knoblauch
so
highly
distinguished
by
his
researches
on
radiant
heat
plucker
and
faraday
investigations
filled
all
minds
at
the
time
and
towards
the
end
of
professor
knoblauch
and
myself
commenced
a
joint
investigation
of
the
entire
question
long
discipline
was
necessary
to
give
us
due
mastery
over
it
employing
a
method
proposed
by
dove
we
examined
the
optical
properties
of
our
crystals
ourselves
and
these
optical
observations
went
hand
in
hand
with
our
magnetic
experiments
the
number
of
these
experiments
was
very
great
but
for
a
considerable
time
no
fact
of
importance
was
added
to
those
already
published
at
length
however
it
was
our
fortune
to
meet
with
various
crystals
whose
deportment
could
not
be
brought
under
the
laws
of
action
enunciated
by
plucker
we
also
discovered
instances
which
led
us
to
suppose
that
the
force
was
by
no
means
independent
as
alleged
of
the
magnetism
or
diamagnetism
of
the
mass
of
the
crystal
indeed
the
more
we
worked
at
the
subject
the
more
clearly
did
it
appear
to
us
that
the
deportment
of
crystals
in
the
magnetic
field
was
due
not
to
a
force
previously
unknown
but
to
the
modification
of
the
known
forces
of
magnetism
and
diamagnetism
by
crystalline
aggregation
an
eminent
example
of
action
adduced
by
plucker
and
experimented
on
by
faraday
was
iceland
spar
it
is
what
in
optics
is
called
a
negative
crystal
and
according
to
the
law
of
plucker
the
axis
of
such
a
crystal
was
always
repelled
by
a
magnet
but
we
showed
that
it
was
only
necessary
to
substitute
in
whole
or
in
part
carbonate
of
iron
for
carbonate
of
lime
thus
changing
the
magnetic
but
not
the
optical
character
of
the
crystal
to
cause
the
axis
to
be
attracted
that
the
deportment
of
magnetic
crystals
is
exactly
antithetical
to
that
of
diamagnetic
crystals
isomorphous
with
the
magnetic
ones
was
proved
to
be
a
general
law
of
action
in
all
cases
the
line
which
in
a
diamagnetic
crystal
set
equatorially
always
set
itself
in
an
isomorphous
magnetic
crystal
axially
by
mechanical
compression
other
bodies
were
also
made
to
imitate
the
iceland
spar
these
and
numerous
other
results
bearing
upon
the
question
were
published
at
the
time
in
the
magazine
and
in
annalen
and
the
investigation
of
diamagnetism
and
action
was
subsequently
continued
by
me
in
the
laboratory
of
professor
magnus
of
berlin
in
december
after
i
had
quitted
germany
bence
jones
went
to
the
prussian
capital
to
see
the
celebrated
experiments
of
du
bois
reymond
influenced
i
suppose
by
what
he
there
heard
he
afterwards
invited
me
to
give
a
friday
evening
discourse
at
the
royal
institution
i
consented
not
without
fear
and
trembling
for
the
royal
institution
was
to
me
a
kind
of
dragon
den
where
tact
and
strength
would
be
necessary
to
save
me
from
destruction
on
february
the
discourse
was
given
and
it
ended
happily
i
allude
to
these
things
that
i
may
mention
that
though
my
aim
and
object
in
that
lecture
was
to
subvert
the
notions
both
of
faraday
and
plucker
and
to
establish
in
opposition
to
their
views
what
i
regarded
as
the
truth
it
was
very
far
from
producing
in
faraday
either
enmity
or
anger
at
the
conclusion
of
the
lecture
he
quitted
his
accustomed
seat
crossed
the
theatre
to
the
corner
into
which
i
had
shrunk
shook
me
by
the
hand
and
brought
me
back
to
the
table
once
more
subsequently
and
in
connection
with
a
related
question
i
ventured
to
differ
from
him
still
more
emphatically
it
was
done
out
of
trust
in
the
greatness
of
his
character
nor
was
the
trust
misplaced
he
felt
my
public
dissent
from
him
and
it
pained
me
afterwards
to
the
quick
to
think
that
i
had
given
him
even
momentary
annoyance
it
was
however
only
momentary
his
soul
was
above
all
littleness
and
proof
to
all
egotism
he
was
the
same
to
me
afterwards
that
he
had
been
before
the
very
chance
expression
which
led
me
to
conclude
that
he
felt
my
dissent
being
one
of
kindness
and
affection
it
required
long
subsequent
effort
to
subdue
the
complications
of
action
and
to
bring
under
the
dominion
of
elementary
principles
the
vast
mass
of
facts
which
the
experiments
of
faraday
and
plucker
had
brought
to
light
it
was
proved
by
reich
edmond
becquerel
and
myself
that
the
condition
of
diamagnetic
bodies
in
virtue
of
which
they
were
repelled
by
the
poles
of
a
magnet
was
excited
in
them
by
those
poles
that
the
strength
of
this
condition
rose
and
fell
with
and
was
proportional
to
the
strength
of
the
acting
magnet
it
was
not
then
any
property
possessed
permanently
by
the
bismuth
and
which
merely
required
the
development
of
magnetism
to
act
upon
it
that
caused
the
repulsion
for
then
the
repulsion
would
have
been
simply
proportional
to
the
strength
of
the
influencing
magnet
whereas
experiment
proved
it
to
augment
as
the
square
of
the
strength
the
capacity
to
be
repelled
was
therefore
not
inherent
in
the
bismuth
but
induced
so
far
an
identity
of
action
was
established
between
magnetic
and
diamagnetic
bodies
after
this
the
deportment
of
magnetic
bodies
and
crystalline
amorphous
and
compressed
was
compared
with
that
of
crystalline
amorphous
and
compressed
diamagnetic
bodies
and
by
a
series
of
experiments
executed
in
the
laboratory
of
this
institution
the
most
complete
antithesis
was
established
between
magnetism
and
diamagnetism
this
antithesis
embraced
the
quality
of
polarity
the
theory
of
reversed
polarity
first
propounded
by
faraday
being
proved
to
be
true
the
discussion
of
the
question
was
very
brisk
on
the
continent
professor
wilhelm
weber
was
the
ablest
and
most
successful
supporter
of
the
doctrine
of
diamagnetic
polarity
and
it
was
with
an
apparatus
devised
by
him
and
constructed
under
his
own
superintendence
by
leyser
of
leipzig
that
the
last
demands
of
the
opponents
of
diamagnetic
polarity
were
satisfied
the
establishment
of
this
point
was
absolutely
necessary
to
the
explanation
of
action
with
that
admirable
instinct
which
always
guided
him
faraday
had
seen
that
it
was
possible
if
not
probable
that
the
diamagnetic
force
acts
with
different
degrees
of
intensity
in
different
directions
through
the
mass
of
a
crystal
in
his
studies
on
electricity
he
had
sought
an
experimental
reply
to
the
question
whether
crystalline
bodies
had
not
different
specific
inductive
capacities
in
different
directions
but
he
failed
to
establish
any
difference
of
the
kind
his
first
attempt
to
establish
differences
of
diamagnetic
action
in
different
directions
through
bismuth
was
also
a
failure
but
he
must
have
felt
this
to
be
a
point
of
cardinal
importance
for
he
returned
to
the
subject
in
and
proved
that
bismuth
was
repelled
with
different
degrees
of
force
in
different
directions
it
seemed
as
if
the
crystal
were
compounded
of
two
diamagnetic
bodies
of
different
strengths
the
substance
being
more
strongly
repelled
across
the
axis
than
along
it
the
same
result
was
obtained
independently
and
extended
to
various
other
bodies
magnetic
as
well
as
diamagnetic
and
also
to
compressed
substances
a
little
subsequently
by
myself
the
law
of
action
in
relation
to
this
point
is
that
in
diamagnetic
crystals
the
line
along
which
the
repulsion
is
a
maximum
sets
equatorially
in
the
magnetic
field
while
in
magnetic
crystals
the
line
along
which
the
attraction
is
a
maximum
sets
from
pole
to
pole
faraday
had
said
that
the
force
was
neither
attraction
nor
repulsion
thus
far
he
was
right
it
was
neither
taken
singly
but
it
was
both
by
the
combination
of
the
doctrine
of
diamagnetic
polarity
with
these
differential
attractions
and
repulsions
and
by
paying
due
regard
to
the
character
of
the
magnetic
field
every
fact
brought
to
light
in
the
domain
of
action
received
complete
explanation
the
most
perplexing
of
those
facts
were
shown
to
result
from
the
action
of
mechanical
couples
which
the
proved
polarity
both
of
magnetism
and
diamagnetism
brought
into
play
indeed
the
thoroughness
with
which
the
experiments
of
faraday
were
thus
explained
is
the
most
striking
possible
demonstration
of
the
marvellous
precision
with
which
they
were
executed

when
an
experimental
result
was
obtained
by
faraday
it
was
instantly
enlarged
by
his
imagination
i
am
acquainted
with
no
mind
whose
power
and
suddenness
of
expansion
at
the
touch
of
new
physical
truth
could
be
ranked
with
his
sometimes
i
have
compared
the
action
of
his
experiments
on
his
mind
to
that
of
highly
combustible
matter
thrown
into
a
furnace
every
fresh
entry
of
fact
was
accompanied
by
the
immediate
development
of
light
and
heat
the
light
which
was
intellectual
enabled
him
to
see
far
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
fact
itself
and
the
heat
which
was
emotional
urged
him
to
the
conquest
of
this
domain
but
though
the
force
of
his
imagination
was
enormous
he
bridled
it
like
a
mighty
rider
and
never
permitted
his
intellect
to
be
overthrown
in
virtue
of
the
expansive
power
which
his
vivid
imagination
conferred
upon
him
he
rose
from
the
smallest
beginnings
to
the
grandest
ends
having
heard
from
zantedeschi
that
bancalari
had
established
the
magnetism
of
flame
he
repeated
the
experiments
and
augmented
the
results
he
passed
from
flames
to
gases
examining
and
revealing
their
magnetic
and
diamagnetic
powers
and
then
he
suddenly
rose
from
his
bubbles
of
oxygen
and
nitrogen
to
the
atmospheric
envelope
of
the
earth
itself
and
its
relations
to
the
great
question
of
terrestrial
magnetism
the
rapidity
with
which
these
thoughts
assumed
the
form
of
experiments
is
unparalleled
his
power
in
this
respect
is
often
best
illustrated
by
his
minor
investigations
and
perhaps
by
none
more
strikingly
than
by
his
paper
the
diamagnetic
condition
of
flame
and
gases
published
as
a
letter
to
richard
taylor
in
the
magazine
for
december
after
verifying
varying
and
expanding
the
results
of
bancalari
he
submitted
to
examination
heated
produced
by
platinum
spirals
placed
in
the
magnetic
field
and
raised
to
incandescence
by
electricity
he
then
examined
the
magnetic
deportment
of
gases
generally
almost
all
of
these
gases
are
invisible
but
he
must
nevertheless
track
them
in
their
unseen
courses
he
could
not
effect
this
by
mingling
smoke
with
his
gases
for
the
action
of
his
magnet
upon
the
smoke
would
have
troubled
his
conclusions
he
therefore
his
gases
in
tubes
carried
them
out
of
the
magnetic
field
and
made
them
reveal
themselves
at
a
distance
from
the
magnet
immersing
one
gas
in
another
he
determined
their
differential
action
results
of
the
utmost
beauty
being
thus
arrived
at
perhaps
the
most
important
are
those
obtained
with
atmospheric
air
and
its
two
constituents
oxygen
in
various
media
was
strongly
attracted
by
the
magnet
in
for
example
it
was
powerfully
magnetic
whereas
nitrogen
was
diamagnetic
some
of
the
effects
obtained
with
oxygen
in
were
strikingly
beautiful
when
the
fumes
of
chloride
of
ammonium
a
diamagnetic
substance
were
mingled
with
the
oxygen
the
cloud
of
chloride
behaved
in
a
most
singular
manner
attraction
of
iron
filings
says
faraday
a
magnetic
pole
is
not
more
striking
than
the
appearance
presented
by
the
oxygen
under
these
circumstances
on
observing
this
deportment
the
question
immediately
occurs
to
him
can
we
not
separate
the
oxygen
of
the
atmosphere
from
its
nitrogen
by
magnetic
analysis
it
is
the
perpetual
occurrence
of
such
questions
that
marks
the
great
experimenter
the
attempt
to
analyze
atmospheric
air
by
magnetic
force
proved
a
failure
like
the
previous
attempt
to
influence
crystallization
by
the
magnet
the
enormous
comparative
power
of
the
force
of
crystallization
i
have
already
assigned
as
a
reason
for
the
incompetence
of
the
magnet
to
determine
molecular
arrangement
in
the
present
instance
the
magnetic
analysis
is
opposed
by
the
force
of
diffusion
which
is
also
very
strong
comparatively
the
same
remark
applies
to
and
is
illustrated
by
another
experiment
subsequently
executed
by
faraday
water
is
diamagnetic
sulphate
of
iron
is
strongly
magnetic
he
enclosed
dilute
solution
of
sulphate
of
iron
in
a
tube
and
placed
the
lower
end
of
the
tube
between
the
poles
of
a
powerful
horseshoe
magnet
for
days
together
but
he
could
produce
concentration
of
the
solution
in
the
part
near
the
magnet
here
also
the
diffusibility
of
the
salt
was
too
powerful
for
the
force
brought
against
it
the
experiment
last
referred
to
is
recorded
in
a
paper
presented
to
the
royal
society
on
the
august
in
which
he
pursues
the
investigation
of
the
magnetism
of
gases
newton
observations
on
were
often
referred
to
by
faraday
his
delight
in
a
was
like
that
of
a
boy
and
he
often
introduced
them
into
his
lectures
causing
them
when
filled
with
air
to
float
on
invisible
seas
of
carbonic
acid
and
otherwise
employing
them
as
a
means
of
illustration
he
now
finds
them
exceedingly
useful
in
his
experiments
on
the
magnetic
condition
of
gases
a
bubble
of
air
in
a
magnetic
field
occupied
by
air
was
unaffected
save
through
the
feeble
repulsion
of
its
envelope
a
bubble
of
nitrogen
on
the
contrary
was
repelled
from
the
magnetic
axis
with
a
force
far
surpassing
that
of
a
bubble
of
air
the
deportment
of
oxygen
in
air
very
impressive
the
bubble
being
pulled
inward
or
towards
the
axial
line
sharply
and
suddenly
as
if
the
oxygen
were
highly
magnetic
he
next
labours
to
establish
the
true
magnetic
zero
a
problem
not
so
easy
as
might
at
first
sight
be
imagined
for
the
action
of
the
magnet
upon
any
gas
while
surrounded
by
air
or
any
other
gas
can
only
be
differential
and
if
the
experiment
were
made
in
vacuo
the
action
of
the
envelope
in
this
case
necessarily
of
a
certain
thickness
would
trouble
the
result
while
dealing
with
this
subject
faraday
makes
some
noteworthy
observations
regarding
space
in
reference
to
the
torricellian
vacuum
he
says
it
is
hardly
necessary
for
me
to
state
that
i
find
both
iron
and
bismuth
in
such
vacua
perfectly
obedient
to
the
magnet
from
such
experiments
and
also
from
general
observations
and
knowledge
it
seems
manifest
that
the
lines
of
magnetic
force
can
traverse
pure
space
just
as
gravitating
force
does
and
as
statical
electrical
forces
do
and
therefore
space
has
a
magnetic
relation
of
its
own
and
one
that
we
shall
probably
find
hereafter
to
be
of
the
utmost
importance
in
natural
phenomena
but
this
character
of
space
is
not
of
the
same
kind
as
that
which
in
relation
to
matter
we
endeavour
to
express
by
the
terms
magnetic
and
diamagnetic
to
confuse
these
together
would
be
to
confound
space
with
matter
and
to
trouble
all
the
conceptions
by
which
we
endeavour
to
understand
and
work
out
a
progressively
clearer
view
of
the
mode
of
action
and
the
laws
of
natural
forces
it
would
be
as
if
in
gravitation
or
electric
forces
one
were
to
confound
the
particles
acting
on
each
other
with
the
space
across
which
they
are
acting
and
would
i
think
shut
the
door
to
advancement
mere
space
can
not
act
as
matter
acts
even
though
the
utmost
latitude
be
allowed
to
the
hypothesis
of
an
ether
and
admitting
that
hypothesis
it
would
be
a
large
additional
assumption
to
suppose
that
the
lines
of
magnetic
force
are
vibrations
carried
on
by
it
whilst
as
yet
we
have
no
proof
that
time
is
required
for
their
propagation
or
in
what
respect
they
may
in
general
character
assimilate
to
or
differ
from
their
respective
lines
of
gravitating
luminiferous
or
electric
forces
pure
space
he
assumes
to
be
the
true
magnetic
zero
but
he
pushes
his
inquiries
to
ascertain
whether
among
material
substances
there
may
not
be
some
which
resemble
space
if
you
follow
his
experiments
you
will
soon
emerge
into
the
light
of
his
results
a
was
suspended
by
a
skein
of
cocoon
silk
at
one
end
of
the
beam
was
fixed
a
inch
long
tubes
of
exceedingly
thin
glass
filled
with
various
gases
and
hermetically
sealed
were
suspended
in
pairs
from
the
two
ends
of
the
the
position
of
the
rotating
was
such
that
the
two
tubes
were
at
opposite
sides
of
and
equidistant
from
the
magnetic
axis
that
is
to
say
from
the
line
joining
the
two
closely
approximated
polar
points
of
an
his
object
was
to
compare
the
magnetic
action
of
the
gases
in
the
two
tubes
when
one
tube
was
filled
with
oxygen
and
the
other
with
nitrogen
on
the
supervention
of
the
magnetic
force
the
oxygen
was
pulled
towards
the
axis
the
nitrogen
being
pushed
out
by
turning
the
they
could
be
restored
to
their
primitive
position
of
equidistance
where
it
is
evident
the
action
of
the
glass
envelopes
was
annulled
the
amount
of
torsion
necessary
to
equidistance
expressed
the
magnetic
difference
of
the
substances
compared
and
then
he
compared
oxygen
with
oxygen
at
different
pressures
one
of
his
tubes
contained
the
gas
at
the
pressure
of
inches
of
mercury
another
at
a
pressure
of
inches
of
mercury
a
third
at
a
pressure
of
inches
while
a
fourth
was
exhausted
as
far
as
a
good
renders
exhaustion
possible
the
first
of
these
was
compared
with
the
other
three
the
effect
was
most
striking
it
was
drawn
towards
the
axis
when
the
magnet
was
excited
the
tube
containing
the
rarer
gas
being
apparently
driven
away
and
the
greater
the
difference
between
the
densities
of
the
two
gases
the
greater
was
the
energy
of
this
action
and
now
observe
his
mode
of
reaching
a
material
magnetic
zero
when
a
bubble
of
nitrogen
was
exposed
in
air
in
the
magnetic
field
on
the
supervention
of
the
power
the
bubble
retreated
from
the
magnet
a
less
acute
observer
would
have
set
nitrogen
down
as
diamagnetic
but
faraday
knew
that
retreat
in
a
medium
composed
in
part
of
oxygen
might
be
due
to
the
attraction
of
the
latter
gas
instead
of
to
the
repulsion
of
the
gas
immersed
in
it
but
if
nitrogen
be
really
diamagnetic
then
a
bubble
or
bulb
filled
with
the
dense
gas
will
overcome
one
filled
with
the
rarer
gas
from
the
of
his
he
suspended
his
bulbs
of
nitrogen
at
equal
distances
from
the
magnetic
axis
and
found
that
the
rarefaction
or
the
condensation
of
the
gas
in
either
of
the
bulbs
had
not
the
slightest
influence
when
the
magnetic
force
was
developed
the
bulbs
remained
in
their
first
position
even
when
one
was
filled
with
nitrogen
and
the
other
as
far
as
possible
exhausted
nitrogen
in
fact
acted
space
itself
it
was
neither
magnetic
nor
diamagnetic
he
can
not
conveniently
compare
the
paramagnetic
force
of
oxygen
with
iron
in
consequence
of
the
exceeding
magnetic
intensity
of
the
latter
substance
but
he
does
compare
it
with
the
sulphate
of
iron
and
finds
that
bulk
for
bulk
oxygen
is
equally
magnetic
with
a
solution
of
this
substance
in
water
seventeen
times
the
weight
of
the
oxygen
in
crystallized
of
iron
or
times
its
weight
of
metallic
iron
in
that
state
of
combination
by
its
capability
to
deflect
a
fine
glass
fibre
he
finds
that
the
attraction
of
this
bulb
of
oxygen
containing
only
of
a
grain
of
the
gas
at
an
average
distance
of
more
than
an
inch
from
the
magnetic
axis
is
about
equal
to
the
gravitating
force
of
the
same
amount
of
oxygen
as
expressed
by
its
weight
these
facts
could
not
rest
for
an
instant
in
the
mind
of
faraday
without
receiving
that
expansion
to
which
i
have
already
referred
is
hardly
necessary
he
writes
me
to
say
here
that
this
oxygen
can
not
exist
in
the
atmosphere
exerting
such
a
remarkable
and
high
amount
of
magnetic
force
without
having
a
most
important
influence
on
the
disposition
of
the
magnetism
of
the
earth
as
a
planet
especially
if
it
be
remembered
that
its
magnetic
condition
is
greatly
altered
by
variations
of
its
density
and
by
variations
of
its
temperature
i
think
i
see
here
the
real
cause
of
many
of
the
variations
of
that
force
which
have
been
and
are
now
so
carefully
watched
on
different
parts
of
the
surface
of
the
globe
the
daily
variation
and
the
annual
variation
both
seem
likely
to
come
under
it
also
very
many
of
the
irregular
continual
variations
which
the
photographic
process
of
record
renders
so
beautifully
manifest
if
such
expectations
be
confirmed
and
the
influence
of
the
atmosphere
be
found
able
to
produce
results
like
these
then
we
shall
probably
find
a
new
relation
between
the
aurora
borealis
and
the
magnetism
of
the
earth
namely
a
relation
established
more
or
less
through
the
air
itself
in
connection
with
the
space
above
it
and
even
magnetic
relations
and
variations
which
are
not
as
yet
suspected
may
be
suggested
and
rendered
manifest
and
measurable
in
the
further
development
of
what
i
will
venture
to
call
atmospheric
magnetism
i
may
be
in
these
expectations
but
as
yet
i
am
sustained
in
them
by
the
apparent
reality
simplicity
and
sufficiency
of
the
cause
assumed
as
it
at
present
appears
to
my
mind
as
soon
as
i
have
submitted
these
views
to
a
close
consideration
and
the
test
of
accordance
with
observation
and
where
applicable
with
experiments
also
i
will
do
myself
the
honour
to
bring
them
before
the
royal
society
two
elaborate
memoirs
are
then
devoted
to
the
subject
of
atmospheric
magnetism
the
first
sent
to
the
royal
society
on
the
of
october
and
the
second
on
the
of
november
in
these
memoirs
he
discusses
the
effects
of
heat
and
cold
upon
the
magnetism
of
the
air
and
the
action
on
the
magnetic
needle
which
must
result
from
thermal
changes
by
the
convergence
and
divergence
of
the
lines
of
terrestrial
magnetic
force
he
shows
how
the
distribution
of
magnetism
in
the
earth
atmosphere
is
effected
he
applies
his
results
to
the
explanation
of
the
annual
and
of
the
diurnal
variation
he
also
considers
irregular
variations
including
the
action
of
magnetic
storms
he
discusses
at
length
the
observations
at
petersburg
greenwich
hobarton
helena
toronto
and
the
cape
of
good
hope
believing
that
the
facts
revealed
by
his
experiments
furnish
the
key
to
the
variations
observed
at
all
these
places
in
the
year
i
had
the
honour
of
an
interview
with
humboldt
in
berlin
and
his
parting
words
to
me
then
were
faraday
that
i
entirely
agree
with
him
and
that
he
has
in
my
opinion
completely
explained
the
variation
of
the
declination
eminent
men
have
since
informed
me
that
humboldt
was
hasty
in
expressing
this
opinion
in
fact
faraday
memoirs
on
atmospheric
magnetism
lost
much
of
their
force
perhaps
too
much
through
the
important
discovery
of
the
relation
of
the
variation
of
the
declination
to
the
number
of
the
solar
spots
but
i
agree
with
him
and
edmond
becquerel
who
worked
independently
at
this
subject
in
thinking
that
a
body
so
magnetic
as
oxygen
swathing
the
earth
and
subject
to
variations
of
temperature
diurnal
and
annual
must
affect
the
manifestations
of
terrestrial
magnetism
the
air
that
stands
upon
a
single
square
foot
of
the
earth
surface
is
according
to
faraday
equivalent
in
magnetic
force
to
lbs
of
crystallized
protosulphate
of
iron
such
a
substance
can
not
be
absolutely
neutral
as
regards
the
deportment
of
the
magnetic
needle
but
faraday
writings
on
this
subject
are
so
voluminous
and
the
theoretic
points
are
so
novel
and
intricate
that
i
shall
postpone
the
complete
analysis
of
these
researches
to
a
time
when
i
can
lay
hold
of
them
more
completely
than
my
other
duties
allow
me
to
do
now
footnote
to
chapter
this
persuasion
has
been
greatly
strengthened
by
the
recent
perusal
of
a
paper
by
baxendell
chapter
speculations
nature
of
matter
lines
of
force
the
scientific
picture
of
faraday
would
not
be
complete
without
a
reference
to
his
speculative
writings
on
friday
january
he
opened
the
weekly
of
the
royal
institution
by
a
discourse
entitled
speculation
touching
electric
conduction
and
the
nature
of
matter
in
this
discourse
he
not
only
attempts
the
overthrow
of
dalton
theory
of
atoms
but
also
the
subversion
of
all
ordinary
scientific
ideas
regarding
the
nature
and
relations
of
matter
and
force
he
objected
to
the
use
of
the
term
atom
have
not
yet
found
a
mind
he
says
did
habitually
separate
it
from
its
accompanying
temptations
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
words
definite
proportions
equivalent
primes
which
did
and
do
fully
express
all
the
facts
of
what
is
usually
called
the
atomic
theory
in
chemistry
were
dismissed
because
they
were
not
expressive
enough
and
did
not
say
all
that
was
in
the
mind
of
him
who
used
the
word
atom
in
their
stead
a
moment
will
be
granted
me
to
indicate
my
own
view
of
position
here
the
word
was
not
used
in
the
stead
of
definite
proportions
equivalents
or
primes
these
terms
represented
facts
that
followed
from
but
were
not
equivalent
to
the
atomic
theory
facts
can
not
satisfy
the
mind
and
the
law
of
definite
combining
proportions
being
once
established
the
question
should
combination
take
place
according
to
that
law
is
inevitable
dalton
answered
this
question
by
the
enunciation
of
the
atomic
theory
the
fundamental
idea
of
which
is
in
my
opinion
perfectly
secure
the
objection
of
faraday
to
dalton
might
be
urged
with
the
same
substantial
force
against
newton
it
might
be
stated
with
regard
to
the
planetary
motions
that
the
laws
of
kepler
revealed
the
facts
that
the
introduction
of
the
principle
of
gravitation
was
an
addition
to
the
facts
but
this
is
the
essence
of
all
theory
the
theory
is
the
backward
guess
from
fact
to
principle
the
conjecture
or
divination
regarding
something
which
lies
behind
the
facts
and
from
which
they
flow
in
necessary
sequence
if
theory
then
account
for
the
definite
proportions
observed
in
the
combinations
of
chemistry
its
justification
rests
upon
the
same
basis
as
that
of
the
principle
of
gravitation
all
that
can
in
strictness
be
said
in
either
case
is
that
the
facts
occur
as
if
the
principle
existed
the
manner
in
which
faraday
himself
habitually
deals
with
his
hypotheses
is
revealed
in
this
lecture
he
incessantly
employed
them
to
gain
experimental
ends
but
he
incessantly
took
them
down
as
an
architect
removes
the
scaffolding
when
the
edifice
is
complete
can
not
but
doubt
he
says
he
who
as
a
mere
philosopher
has
most
power
of
penetrating
the
secrets
of
nature
and
guessing
by
hypothesis
at
her
mode
of
working
will
also
be
most
careful
for
his
own
safe
progress
and
that
of
others
to
distinguish
the
knowledge
which
consists
of
assumption
by
which
i
mean
theory
and
hypothesis
from
that
which
is
the
knowledge
of
facts
and
laws
faraday
himself
in
fact
was
always
by
hypothesis
and
making
theoretic
divination
the
to
his
experimental
results
i
have
already
more
than
once
dwelt
on
the
vividness
with
which
he
realised
molecular
conditions
we
have
a
fine
example
of
this
strength
and
brightness
of
imagination
in
the
present
he
grapples
with
the
notion
that
matter
is
made
up
of
particles
not
in
absolute
contact
but
surrounded
by
interatomic
space
he
observes
be
taken
as
the
only
continuous
part
of
a
body
so
constituted
space
will
permeate
all
masses
of
matter
in
every
direction
like
a
net
except
that
in
place
of
meshes
it
will
form
cells
isolating
each
atom
from
its
neighbours
itself
only
being
continuous
let
us
follow
out
this
notion
consider
he
argues
the
case
of
a
of
electricity
such
for
example
as
with
its
molecules
and
intermolecular
spaces
running
through
the
mass
in
its
case
space
must
be
an
insulator
for
if
it
were
a
conductor
it
would
resemble
fine
metallic
web
penetrating
the
lac
in
every
direction
but
the
fact
is
that
it
resembles
the
wax
of
black
which
surrounds
and
insulates
the
particles
of
conducting
carbon
interspersed
throughout
its
mass
in
the
case
of
therefore
space
is
an
insulator
but
now
take
the
case
of
a
conducting
metal
here
we
have
as
before
the
swathing
of
space
round
every
atom
if
space
be
an
insulator
there
can
be
no
transmission
of
electricity
from
atom
to
atom
but
there
is
transmission
hence
space
is
a
conductor
thus
he
endeavours
to
hamper
the
atomic
theory
reasoning
he
says
in
a
subversion
of
that
theory
altogether
for
if
space
be
an
insulator
it
can
not
exist
in
conducting
bodies
and
if
it
be
a
conductor
it
can
not
exist
in
insulating
bodies
any
ground
of
reasoning
he
adds
as
if
carried
away
by
the
ardour
of
argument
tends
to
such
conclusions
as
these
must
in
itself
be
false
he
then
tosses
the
atomic
theory
from
horn
to
horn
of
his
dilemmas
what
do
we
know
he
asks
of
the
atom
apart
from
its
force
you
imagine
a
nucleus
which
may
be
called
a
and
surround
it
by
forces
which
may
be
called
m
my
mind
the
a
or
nucleus
vanishes
and
the
substance
consists
in
the
powers
of
and
indeed
what
notion
can
we
form
of
the
nucleus
independent
of
its
powers
what
thought
remains
on
which
to
hang
the
imagination
of
an
a
independent
of
the
acknowledged
forces
like
boscovich
he
abolishes
the
atom
and
puts
a
of
force
in
its
place
with
his
usual
courage
and
sincerity
he
pushes
his
view
to
its
utmost
consequences
view
of
the
constitution
of
matter
he
continues
seem
to
involve
necessarily
the
conclusion
that
matter
fills
all
space
or
at
least
all
space
to
which
gravitation
extends
for
gravitation
is
a
property
of
matter
dependent
on
a
certain
force
and
it
is
this
force
which
constitutes
the
matter
in
that
view
matter
is
not
merely
mutually
penetrable
but
each
atom
extends
so
to
say
throughout
the
whole
of
the
solar
system
yet
always
retaining
its
own
centre
of
force
it
is
the
operation
of
a
mind
filled
with
thoughts
of
this
profound
strange
and
subtle
character
that
we
have
to
take
into
account
in
dealing
with
faraday
later
researches
a
similar
cast
of
thought
pervades
a
letter
addressed
by
faraday
to
richard
phillips
and
published
in
the
magazine
for
may
it
is
entitled
on
and
it
contains
one
of
the
most
singular
speculations
that
ever
emanated
from
a
scientific
mind
it
must
be
remembered
here
that
though
faraday
lived
amid
such
speculations
he
did
not
rate
them
highly
and
that
he
was
prepared
at
any
moment
to
change
them
or
let
them
go
they
spurred
him
on
but
they
did
not
hamper
him
his
theoretic
notions
were
fluent
and
when
minds
less
plastic
than
his
own
attempted
to
render
those
fluxional
images
rigid
he
rebelled
he
warns
phillips
moreover
that
from
first
to
last
merely
threw
out
as
matter
for
speculation
the
vague
impressions
of
his
mind
for
he
gave
nothing
as
the
result
of
sufficient
consideration
or
as
the
settled
conviction
or
even
probable
conclusion
at
which
he
had
arrived
the
gist
of
this
communication
is
that
gravitating
force
acts
in
lines
across
space
and
that
the
vibrations
of
light
and
radiant
heat
consist
in
the
tremors
of
these
lines
of
force
notion
he
says
far
as
it
is
admitted
will
dispense
with
the
ether
which
in
another
view
is
supposed
to
be
the
medium
in
which
these
vibrations
take
place
and
he
adds
further
on
that
his
view
to
dismiss
the
ether
but
not
the
vibrations
the
idea
here
set
forth
is
the
natural
supplement
of
his
previous
notion
that
it
is
gravitating
force
which
constitutes
matter
each
atom
extending
so
to
say
throughout
the
whole
of
the
solar
system
the
letter
to
phillips
winds
up
with
this
beautiful
conclusion
think
it
likely
that
i
have
made
many
mistakes
in
the
preceding
pages
for
even
to
myself
my
ideas
on
this
point
appear
only
as
the
shadow
of
a
speculation
or
as
one
of
those
impressions
upon
the
mind
which
are
allowable
for
a
time
as
guides
to
thought
and
research
he
who
labours
in
experimental
inquiries
knows
how
numerous
these
are
and
how
often
their
apparent
fitness
and
beauty
vanish
before
the
progress
and
development
of
real
natural
truth
let
it
then
be
remembered
that
faraday
entertained
notions
regarding
matter
and
force
altogether
distinct
from
the
views
generally
held
by
scientific
men
force
seemed
to
him
an
entity
dwelling
along
the
line
in
which
it
is
exerted
the
lines
along
which
gravity
acts
between
the
sun
and
earth
seem
figured
in
his
mind
as
so
many
elastic
strings
indeed
he
accepts
the
assumed
instantaneity
of
gravity
as
the
expression
of
the
enormous
elasticity
of
the
of
weight
such
views
fruitful
in
the
case
of
magnetism
barren
as
yet
in
the
case
of
gravity
explain
his
efforts
to
transform
this
latter
force
when
he
goes
into
the
open
air
and
permits
his
helices
to
fall
to
his
mind
eye
they
are
tearing
through
the
lines
of
gravitating
power
and
hence
his
hope
and
conviction
that
an
effect
would
and
ought
to
be
produced
it
must
ever
be
borne
in
mind
that
faraday
difficulty
in
dealing
with
these
conceptions
was
at
bottom
the
same
as
that
of
newton
that
he
is
in
fact
trying
to
overleap
this
difficulty
and
with
it
probably
the
limits
prescribed
to
the
intellect
itself
the
idea
of
lines
of
magnetic
force
was
suggested
to
faraday
by
the
linear
arrangement
of
iron
filings
when
scattered
over
a
magnet
he
speaks
of
and
illustrates
by
sketches
the
deflection
both
convergent
and
divergent
of
the
lines
of
force
when
they
pass
respectively
through
magnetic
and
diamagnetic
bodies
these
notions
of
concentration
and
divergence
are
also
based
on
the
direct
observation
of
his
filings
so
long
did
he
brood
upon
these
lines
so
habitually
did
he
associate
them
with
his
experiments
on
induced
currents
that
the
association
became
and
he
could
not
think
without
them
have
been
so
accustomed
he
writes
employ
them
and
especially
in
my
last
researches
that
i
may
have
unwittingly
become
prejudiced
in
their
favour
and
ceased
to
be
a
judge
still
i
have
always
endeavoured
to
make
experiment
the
test
and
controller
of
theory
and
opinion
but
neither
by
that
nor
by
close
in
principle
have
i
been
made
aware
of
any
error
involved
in
their
use
in
his
later
researches
on
action
the
idea
of
lines
of
force
is
extensively
employed
it
indeed
led
him
to
an
experiment
which
lies
at
the
root
of
the
whole
question
in
his
subsequent
researches
on
atmospheric
magnetism
the
idea
receives
still
wider
application
showing
itself
to
be
wonderfully
flexible
and
convenient
indeed
without
this
conception
the
attempt
to
seize
upon
the
magnetic
actions
possible
or
actual
of
the
atmosphere
would
be
difficult
in
the
extreme
but
the
notion
of
lines
of
force
and
of
their
divergence
and
convergence
guides
faraday
without
perplexity
through
all
the
intricacies
of
the
question
after
the
completion
of
those
researches
and
in
a
paper
forwarded
to
the
royal
society
on
october
he
devotes
himself
to
the
formal
development
and
illustration
of
his
favourite
idea
the
paper
bears
the
title
lines
of
magnetic
force
their
definite
character
and
their
distribution
within
a
magnet
and
through
space
a
deep
reflectiveness
is
the
characteristic
of
this
memoir
in
his
experiments
which
are
perfectly
beautiful
and
profoundly
suggestive
he
takes
but
a
secondary
delight
his
object
is
to
illustrate
the
utility
of
his
conception
of
lines
of
force
study
of
these
lines
he
says
at
different
times
been
greatly
influential
in
leading
me
to
various
results
which
i
think
prove
their
utility
as
well
as
fertility
faraday
for
a
long
period
used
the
lines
of
force
merely
as
representative
idea
he
seemed
for
a
time
averse
to
going
further
in
expression
than
the
lines
themselves
however
much
further
he
may
have
gone
in
idea
that
he
believed
them
to
exist
at
all
times
round
a
magnet
and
irrespective
of
the
existence
of
magnetic
matter
such
as
iron
filings
external
to
the
magnet
is
certain
no
doubt
the
space
round
every
magnet
presented
itself
to
his
imagination
as
traversed
by
loops
of
magnetic
power
but
he
was
chary
in
speaking
of
the
physical
substratum
of
those
loops
indeed
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
physical
theory
of
lines
of
force
presented
itself
with
any
distinctness
to
his
own
mind
the
possible
complicity
of
the
luminiferous
ether
in
magnetic
phenomena
was
certainly
in
his
thoughts
the
magnetic
force
he
writes
transferred
through
bodies
or
through
space
we
know
not
whether
the
result
is
merely
action
at
a
distance
as
in
the
case
of
gravity
or
by
some
intermediate
agency
as
in
the
case
of
light
heat
the
electric
current
and
as
i
believe
static
electric
action
the
idea
of
magnetic
fluids
as
applied
by
some
or
of
magnetic
centres
of
action
does
not
include
that
of
the
latter
kind
of
transmission
but
the
idea
of
lines
of
force
does
and
he
continues
thus
am
more
inclined
to
the
notion
that
in
the
transmission
of
the
magnetic
force
there
is
such
an
action
an
intermediate
agency
external
to
the
magnet
than
that
the
effects
are
merely
attraction
and
repulsion
at
a
distance
such
an
affection
may
be
a
function
of
the
ether
for
it
is
not
at
all
unlikely
that
if
there
be
an
ether
it
should
have
other
uses
than
simply
the
conveyance
of
radiations
when
he
speaks
of
the
magnet
in
certain
cases
amongst
its
own
forces
he
appears
to
have
some
conception
of
this
kind
in
view
a
great
part
of
the
investigation
completed
in
october
was
taken
up
with
the
motions
of
wires
round
the
poles
of
a
magnet
and
the
converse
he
carried
an
insulated
wire
along
the
axis
of
a
bar
magnet
from
its
pole
to
its
equator
where
it
issued
from
the
magnet
and
was
bent
up
so
as
to
connect
its
two
ends
a
complete
circuit
no
part
of
which
was
in
contact
with
the
magnet
was
thus
obtained
he
found
that
when
the
magnet
and
the
external
wire
were
rotated
together
no
current
was
produced
whereas
when
either
of
them
was
rotated
and
the
other
left
at
rest
currents
were
evolved
he
then
abandoned
the
axial
wire
and
allowed
the
magnet
itself
to
take
its
place
the
result
was
the
same
it
was
the
relative
motion
of
the
magnet
and
the
loop
that
was
effectual
in
producing
a
current
the
lines
of
force
have
their
roots
in
the
magnet
and
though
they
may
expand
into
infinite
space
they
eventually
return
to
the
magnet
now
these
lines
may
be
intersected
close
to
the
magnet
or
at
a
distance
from
it
faraday
finds
distance
to
be
perfectly
immaterial
so
long
as
the
number
of
lines
intersected
is
the
same
for
example
when
the
loop
connecting
the
equator
and
the
pole
of
his
barmagnet
performs
one
complete
revolution
round
the
magnet
it
is
manifest
that
all
the
lines
of
force
issuing
from
the
magnet
are
once
intersected
now
it
matters
not
whether
the
loop
be
ten
feet
or
ten
inches
in
length
it
matters
not
how
it
may
be
twisted
and
contorted
it
matters
not
how
near
to
the
magnet
or
how
distant
from
it
the
loop
may
be
one
revolution
always
produces
the
same
amount
of
current
electricity
because
in
all
these
cases
all
the
lines
of
force
issuing
from
the
magnet
are
once
intersected
and
no
more
from
the
external
portion
of
the
circuit
he
passes
in
idea
to
the
internal
and
follows
the
lines
of
force
into
the
body
of
the
magnet
itself
his
conclusion
is
that
there
exist
lines
of
force
within
the
magnet
of
the
same
nature
as
those
without
what
is
more
they
are
exactly
equal
in
amount
to
those
without
they
have
a
relation
in
direction
to
those
without
and
in
fact
are
continuations
of
them
line
of
force
therefore
at
whatever
distance
it
may
be
taken
from
the
magnet
must
be
considered
as
a
closed
circuit
passing
in
some
part
of
its
course
through
the
magnet
and
having
an
equal
amount
of
force
in
every
part
of
its
course
all
the
results
here
described
were
obtained
with
moving
metals
he
continues
with
profound
sagacity
motion
would
not
generate
a
relation
which
had
not
a
foundation
in
the
existence
of
some
previous
state
and
therefore
the
quiescent
metals
must
be
in
some
relation
to
the
active
centre
of
force
that
is
to
the
magnet
he
here
touches
the
core
of
the
whole
question
and
when
we
can
state
the
condition
into
which
the
conducting
wire
is
thrown
before
it
is
moved
we
shall
then
be
in
a
position
to
understand
the
physical
constitution
of
the
electric
current
generated
by
its
motion
in
this
inquiry
faraday
worked
with
steel
magnets
the
force
of
which
varies
with
the
distance
from
the
magnet
he
then
sought
a
uniform
field
of
magnetic
force
and
found
it
in
space
as
affected
by
the
magnetism
of
the
earth
his
next
memoir
sent
to
the
royal
society
december
is
the
employment
of
the
induced
magnetoelectro
current
as
a
test
and
measure
of
magnetic
forces
he
forms
rectangles
and
rings
and
by
ingenious
and
simple
devices
collects
the
opposed
currents
which
are
developed
in
them
by
rotation
across
the
terrestrial
lines
of
magnetic
force
he
varies
the
shapes
of
his
rectangles
while
preserving
their
areas
constant
and
finds
that
the
constant
area
produces
always
the
same
amount
of
current
per
revolution
the
current
depends
solely
on
the
number
of
lines
of
force
intersected
and
when
this
number
is
kept
constant
the
current
remains
constant
too
thus
the
lines
of
magnetic
force
are
continually
before
his
eyes
by
their
aid
he
colligates
his
facts
and
through
the
inspirations
derived
from
them
he
vastly
expands
the
boundaries
of
our
experimental
knowledge
the
beauty
and
exactitude
of
the
results
of
this
investigation
are
extraordinary
i
can
not
help
thinking
while
i
dwell
upon
them
that
this
discovery
of
is
the
greatest
experimental
result
ever
obtained
by
an
investigator
it
is
the
mont
blanc
of
faraday
own
achievements
he
always
worked
at
great
elevations
but
a
higher
than
this
he
never
subsequently
attained
footnotes
to

he
compares
the
interpenetration
of
two
atoms
to
the
coalescence
of
two
distinct
waves
which
though
for
a
moment
blended
to
a
single
mass
preserve
their
individuality
and
afterwards
separate
in
this
form
the
experiment
is
identical

unity
and
convertibility
of
natural
forces
theory
of
the
electric
current
the
terms
unity
and
convertibility
as
applied
to
natural
forces
are
often
employed
in
these
investigations
many
profound
and
beautiful
thoughts
respecting
these
subjects
being
expressed
in
faraday
memoirs
modern
inquiry
has
however
much
augmented
our
knowledge
of
the
relationship
of
natural
forces
and
it
seems
worth
while
to
say
a
few
words
here
tending
to
clear
up
certain
misconceptions
which
appear
to
exist
among
philosophic
writers
regarding
this
relationship
the
whole
stock
of
energy
or
in
the
world
consists
of
attractions
repulsions
and
motions
if
the
attractions
and
repulsions
are
so
circumstanced
as
to
be
able
to
produce
motion
they
are
sources
of
but
not
otherwise
let
us
for
the
sake
of
simplicity
confine
our
attention
to
the
case
of
attraction
the
attraction
exerted
between
the
earth
and
a
body
at
a
distance
from
the
earth
surface
is
a
source
of
because
the
body
can
be
moved
by
the
attraction
and
in
falling
to
the
earth
can
perform
work
when
it
rests
upon
the
earth
surface
it
is
not
a
source
of
power
or
energy
because
it
can
fall
no
further
but
though
it
has
ceased
to
be
a
source
of
energy
the
attraction
of
gravity
still
acts
as
a
force
which
holds
the
earth
and
weight
together
the
same
remarks
apply
to
attracting
atoms
and
molecules
as
long
as
distance
separates
them
they
can
move
across
it
in
obedience
to
the
attraction
and
the
motion
thus
produced
may
by
proper
appliances
be
caused
to
perform
mechanical
work
when
for
example
two
atoms
of
hydrogen
unite
with
one
of
oxygen
to
form
water
the
atoms
are
first
drawn
towards
each
other
they
move
they
clash
and
then
by
virtue
of
their
resiliency
they
recoil
and
quiver
to
this
quivering
motion
we
give
the
name
of
heat
now
this
quivering
motion
is
merely
the
redistribution
of
the
motion
produced
by
the
chemical
affinity
and
this
is
the
only
sense
in
which
chemical
affinity
can
be
said
to
be
converted
into
heat
we
must
not
imagine
the
chemical
attraction
destroyed
or
converted
into
anything
else
for
the
atoms
when
mutually
clasped
to
form
a
molecule
of
water
are
held
together
by
the
very
attraction
which
first
drew
them
towards
each
other
that
which
has
really
been
expended
is
the
pull
exerted
through
the
space
by
which
the
distance
between
the
atoms
has
been
diminished
if
this
be
understood
it
will
be
at
once
seen
that
gravity
may
in
this
sense
be
said
to
be
convertible
into
heat
that
it
is
in
reality
no
more
an
outstanding
and
inconvertible
agent
as
it
is
sometimes
stated
to
be
than
chemical
affinity
by
the
exertion
of
a
certain
pull
through
a
certain
space
a
body
is
caused
to
clash
with
a
certain
definite
velocity
against
the
earth
heat
is
thereby
developed
and
this
is
the
only
sense
in
which
gravity
can
be
said
to
be
converted
into
heat
in
no
case
is
the
force
which
produces
the
motion
annihilated
or
changed
into
anything
else
the
mutual
attraction
of
the
earth
and
weight
exists
when
they
are
in
contact
as
when
they
were
separate
but
the
ability
of
that
attraction
to
employ
itself
in
the
production
of
motion
does
not
exist
the
transformation
in
this
case
is
easily
followed
by
the
eye
first
the
weight
as
a
whole
is
set
in
motion
by
the
attraction
of
gravity
this
motion
of
the
mass
is
arrested
by
collision
with
the
earth
being
broken
up
into
molecular
tremors
to
which
we
give
the
name
of
heat
and
when
we
reverse
the
process
and
employ
those
tremors
of
heat
to
raise
a
weight
as
is
done
through
the
intermediation
of
an
elastic
fluid
in
the
a
certain
definite
portion
of
the
molecular
motion
is
destroyed
in
raising
the
weight
in
this
sense
and
this
sense
only
can
the
heat
be
said
to
be
converted
into
gravity
or
more
correctly
into
potential
energy
of
gravity
it
is
not
that
the
destruction
of
the
heat
has
created
any
new
attraction
but
simply
that
the
old
attraction
has
now
a
power
conferred
upon
it
of
exerting
a
certain
definite
pull
in
the
interval
between
the
of
the
falling
weight
and
its
collision
with
the
earth
so
also
as
regards
magnetic
attraction
when
a
sphere
of
iron
placed
at
some
distance
from
a
magnet
rushes
towards
the
magnet
and
has
its
motion
stopped
by
collision
an
effect
mechanically
the
same
as
that
produced
by
the
attraction
of
gravity
occurs
the
magnetic
attraction
generates
the
motion
of
the
mass
and
the
stoppage
of
that
motion
produces
heat
in
this
sense
and
in
this
sense
only
is
there
a
transformation
of
magnetic
work
into
heat
and
if
by
the
mechanical
action
of
heat
brought
to
bear
by
means
of
a
suitable
machine
the
sphere
be
torn
from
the
magnet
and
again
placed
at
a
distance
a
power
of
exerting
a
pull
through
that
distance
and
producing
a
new
motion
of
the
sphere
is
thereby
conferred
upon
the
magnet
in
this
sense
and
in
this
sense
only
is
the
heat
converted
into
magnetic
potential
energy
when
therefore
writers
on
the
conservation
of
energy
speak
of
tensions
being
and
they
do
not
mean
thereby
that
old
attractions
have
been
annihilated
and
new
ones
brought
into
existence
but
that
in
the
one
case
the
power
of
the
attraction
to
produce
motion
has
been
diminished
by
the
shortening
of
the
distance
between
the
attracting
bodies
and
that
in
the
other
case
the
power
of
producing
motion
has
been
augmented
by
the
increase
of
the
distance
these
remarks
apply
to
all
bodies
whether
they
be
sensible
masses
or
molecules
of
the
inner
quality
that
enables
matter
to
attract
matter
we
know
nothing
and
the
law
of
conservation
makes
no
statement
regarding
that
quality
it
takes
the
facts
of
attraction
as
they
stand
and
affirms
only
the
constancy
of
that
power
may
exist
in
the
form
of
motion
or
it
may
exist
in
the
form
of
force
with
distance
to
act
through
the
former
is
dynamic
energy
the
latter
is
potential
energy
the
constancy
of
the
sum
of
both
being
affirmed
by
the
law
of
conservation
the
convertibility
of
natural
forces
consists
solely
in
transformations
of
dynamic
into
potential
and
of
potential
into
dynamic
energy
which
are
incessantly
going
on
in
no
other
sense
has
the
convertibility
of
force
at
present
any
scientific
meaning
by
the
contraction
of
a
muscle
a
man
lifts
a
weight
from
the
earth
but
the
muscle
can
contract
only
through
the
oxidation
of
its
own
tissue
or
of
the
blood
passing
through
it
molecular
motion
is
thus
converted
into
mechanical
motion
supposing
the
muscle
to
contract
without
raising
the
weight
oxidation
would
also
occur
but
the
whole
of
the
heat
produced
by
this
oxidation
would
be
liberated
in
the
muscle
itself
not
so
when
it
performs
external
work
to
do
that
work
a
certain
definite
portion
of
the
heat
of
oxidation
must
be
expended
it
is
so
expended
in
pulling
the
weight
away
from
the
earth
if
the
weight
be
permitted
to
fall
the
heat
generated
by
its
collision
with
the
earth
would
exactly
make
up
for
that
lacking
in
the
muscle
during
the
lifting
of
the
weight
in
the
case
here
supposed
we
have
a
conversion
of
molecular
muscular
action
into
potential
energy
of
gravity
and
a
conversion
of
that
potential
energy
into
heat
the
heat
however
appearing
at
a
distance
from
its
real
origin
in
the
muscle
the
whole
process
consists
of
a
transference
of
molecular
motion
from
the
muscle
to
the
weight
and
gravitating
force
is
the
mere
by
means
of
which
the
transference
is
effected
these
considerations
will
help
to
clear
our
way
to
the
conception
of
the
transformations
which
occur
when
a
wire
is
moved
across
the
lines
of
force
in
a
magnetic
field
in
this
case
it
is
commonly
said
we
have
a
conversion
of
magnetism
into
electricity
but
let
us
endeavour
to
understand
what
really
occurs
for
the
sake
of
simplicity
and
with
a
view
to
its
translation
into
a
different
one
subsequently
let
us
adopt
for
a
moment
the
provisional
conception
of
a
mixed
fluid
in
the
wire
composed
of
positive
and
negative
electricities
in
equal
quantities
and
therefore
perfectly
neutralizing
each
other
when
the
wire
is
still
by
the
motion
of
the
wire
say
with
the
hand
towards
the
magnet
what
the
germans
call
a
a
separating
force
is
brought
into
play
this
force
tears
the
mixed
fluids
asunder
and
drives
them
in
two
currents
the
one
positive
and
the
other
negative
in
two
opposite
directions
through
the
wire
the
presence
of
these
currents
evokes
a
force
of
repulsion
between
the
magnet
and
the
wire
and
to
cause
the
one
to
approach
the
other
this
repulsion
must
be
overcome
the
overcoming
of
this
repulsion
is
in
fact
the
work
done
in
separating
and
impelling
the
two
electricities
when
the
wire
is
moved
away
from
the
magnet
a
or
separating
force
also
comes
into
play
but
now
it
is
an
attraction
that
has
to
be
surmounted
in
surmounting
it
currents
are
developed
in
directions
opposed
to
the
former
positive
takes
the
place
of
negative
and
negative
the
place
of
positive
the
overcoming
of
the
attraction
being
the
work
done
in
separating
and
impelling
the
two
electricities
the
mechanical
action
occurring
here
is
different
from
that
occurring
where
a
sphere
of
soft
iron
is
withdrawn
from
a
magnet
and
again
attracted
in
this
case
muscular
force
is
expended
during
the
act
of
separation
but
the
attraction
of
the
magnet
effects
the
reunion
in
the
case
of
the
moving
wire
also
we
overcome
a
resistance
in
separating
it
from
the
magnet
and
thus
far
the
action
is
mechanically
the
same
as
the
separation
of
the
sphere
of
iron
but
after
the
wire
has
ceased
moving
the
attraction
ceases
and
so
far
from
any
action
occurring
similar
to
that
which
draws
the
iron
sphere
back
to
the
magnet
we
have
to
overcome
a
repulsion
to
bring
them
together
there
is
no
potential
energy
conferred
either
by
the
removal
or
by
the
approach
of
the
wire
and
the
only
power
really
transformed
or
converted
in
the
experiment
is
muscular
power
nothing
that
could
in
strictness
be
called
a
conversion
of
magnetism
into
electricity
occurs
the
muscular
oxidation
that
moves
the
wire
fails
to
produce
within
the
muscle
its
due
amount
of
heat
a
portion
of
that
heat
equivalent
to
the
resistance
overcome
appearing
in
the
moving
wire
instead
is
this
effect
an
attraction
and
a
repulsion
at
a
distance
if
so
why
should
both
cease
when
the
wire
ceases
to
move
in
fact
the
deportment
of
the
wire
resembles
far
more
that
of
a
body
moving
in
a
resisting
medium
than
anything
else
the
resistance
ceasing
when
the
motion
is
suspended
let
us
imagine
the
case
of
a
liquid
so
mobile
that
the
hand
may
be
passed
through
it
to
and
fro
without
encountering
any
sensible
resistance
it
resembles
the
motion
of
a
conductor
in
the
unexcited
field
of
an
now
let
us
suppose
a
body
placed
in
the
liquid
or
acting
on
it
which
confers
upon
it
the
property
of
viscosity
the
hand
would
no
longer
move
freely
during
its
motion
but
then
only
resistance
would
be
encountered
and
overcome
here
we
have
rudely
represented
the
case
of
the
excited
magnetic
field
and
the
result
in
both
cases
would
be
substantially
the
same
in
both
cases
heat
would
in
the
end
be
generated
outside
of
the
muscle
its
amount
being
exactly
equivalent
to
the
resistance
overcome
let
us
push
the
analogy
a
little
further
suppose
in
the
case
of
the
fluid
rendered
viscous
as
assumed
a
moment
ago
the
viscosity
not
to
be
so
great
as
to
prevent
the
formation
of
ripples
when
the
hand
is
passed
through
the
liquid
then
the
motion
of
the
hand
before
its
final
conversion
into
heat
would
exist
for
a
time
as
which
on
subsiding
would
generate
its
due
equivalent
of
heat
this
intermediate
stage
in
the
case
of
our
moving
wire
is
represented
by
the
period
during
which
the
electric
current
is
flowing
through
it
but
that
current
like
the
ripples
of
our
liquid
soon
subsides
being
like
them
converted
into
heat
do
these
words
shadow
forth
anything
like
the
reality
such
speculations
can
not
be
injurious
if
they
are
enunciated
without
dogmatism
i
do
confess
that
ideas
such
as
these
here
indicated
exercise
a
strong
fascination
on
my
mind
is
then
the
magnetic
field
really
viscous
and
if
so
what
substance
exists
in
it
and
the
wire
to
produce
the
viscosity
let
us
first
look
at
the
proved
effects
and
afterwards
turn
our
thoughts
back
upon
their
cause
when
the
wire
approaches
the
magnet
an
action
is
evoked
within
it
which
travels
through
it
with
a
velocity
comparable
to
that
of
light
one
substance
only
in
the
universe
has
been
hitherto
proved
competent
to
transmit
power
at
this
velocity
the
luminiferous
ether
not
only
its
rapidity
of
progression
but
its
ability
to
produce
the
motion
of
light
and
heat
indicates
that
the
electric
current
is
also
motion
further
there
is
a
striking
resemblance
between
the
action
of
good
and
bad
conductors
as
regards
electricity
and
the
action
of
diathermanous
and
adiathermanous
bodies
as
regards
radiant
heat
the
good
conductor
is
diathermanous
to
the
electric
current
it
allows
free
transmission
without
the
development
of
heat
the
bad
conductor
is
adiathermanous
to
the
electric
current
and
hence
the
passage
of
the
latter
is
accompanied
by
the
development
of
heat
i
am
strongly
inclined
to
hold
the
electric
current
pure
and
simple
to
be
a
motion
of
the
ether
alone
good
conductors
being
so
constituted
that
the
motion
may
be
propagated
through
their
ether
without
sensible
transfer
to
their
atoms
while
in
the
case
of
bad
conductors
this
transfer
is
effected
the
transferred
motion
appearing
as
heat
i
do
not
know
whether
faraday
would
have
subscribed
to
what
is
here
written
probably
his
habitual
caution
would
have
prevented
him
from
committing
himself
to
anything
so
definite
but
some
such
idea
filled
his
mind
and
coloured
his
language
through
all
the
later
years
of
his
life
i
dare
not
say
that
he
has
been
always
successful
in
the
treatment
of
these
theoretic
notions
in
his
speculations
he
mixes
together
light
and
darkness
in
varying
proportions
and
carries
us
along
with
him
through
strong
alternations
of
both
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
a
certain
amount
of
mathematical
training
would
have
affected
his
work
we
can
not
say
what
its
influence
would
have
been
upon
that
force
of
inspiration
that
urged
him
on
whether
it
would
have
daunted
him
and
prevented
him
from
driving
his
adits
into
places
where
no
theory
pointed
to
a
lode
if
so
then
we
may
rejoice
that
this
strong
delver
at
the
mine
of
natural
knowledge
was
left
free
to
wield
his
mattock
in
his
own
way
it
must
be
admitted
that
faraday
purely
speculative
writings
often
lack
that
precision
which
the
mathematical
habit
of
thought
confers
still
across
them
flash
frequent
gleams
of
prescient
wisdom
which
will
excite
admiration
throughout
all
time
while
the
facts
relations
principles
and
laws
which
his
experiments
have
established
are
sure
to
form
the
body
of
grand
theories
yet
to
come
footnotes
to
chapter
mr
clerk
maxwell
has
recently
published
an
exceedingly
important
investigation
connected
with
this
question
even
in
the
portions
of
the
memoirs
of
maxwell
the
admirable
spirit
of
his
philosophy
is
sufficiently
revealed
as
regards
the
employment
of
scientific
imagery
i
hardly
know
his
equal
in
power
of
conception
and
clearness
of
definition
one
important
difference
of
course
exists
between
the
effect
of
motion
in
the
magnetic
field
and
motion
in
a
resisting
medium
in
the
former
case
the
heat
is
generated
in
the
moving
conductor
in
the
latter
it
is
in
part
generated
in
the
medium
chapter
summary
when
from
an
alpine
height
the
eye
of
the
climber
ranges
over
the
mountains
he
finds
that
for
the
most
part
they
resolve
themselves
into
distinct
groups
each
consisting
of
a
dominant
mass
surrounded
by
peaks
of
lesser
elevation
the
power
which
lifted
the
mightier
eminences
in
nearly
all
cases
lifted
others
to
an
almost
equal
height
and
so
it
is
with
the
discoveries
of
faraday
as
a
general
rule
the
dominant
result
does
not
stand
alone
but
forms
the
culminating
point
of
a
vast
and
varied
mass
of
inquiry
in
this
way
round
about
his
great
discovery
of
induction
other
weighty
labours
group
themselves
his
investigations
on
the
extra
current
on
the
polar
and
other
condition
of
diamagnetic
bodies
on
lines
of
magnetic
force
their
definite
character
and
distribution
on
the
employment
of
the
induced
current
as
a
measure
and
test
of
magnetic
action
on
the
revulsive
phenomena
of
the
magnetic
field
are
all
notwithstanding
the
diversity
of
title
researches
in
the
domain
of
induction
faraday
second
group
of
researches
and
discoveries
embrace
the
chemical
phenomena
of
the
current
the
dominant
result
here
is
the
great
law
of
definite
decomposition
around
which
are
massed
various
researches
on
conduction
and
on
electrolysis
both
with
the
machine
and
with
the
pile
to
this
group
also
belongs
his
analysis
of
the
contact
theory
his
inquiries
as
to
the
source
of
voltaic
electricity
and
his
final
development
of
the
chemical
theory
of
the
pile
his
third
great
discovery
is
the
magnetization
of
light
which
i
should
liken
to
the
weisshorn
among
mountains
high
beautiful
and
alone
the
dominant
result
of
his
fourth
group
of
researches
is
the
discovery
of
diamagnetism
announced
in
his
memoir
as
the
magnetic
condition
of
all
matter
round
which
are
grouped
his
inquiries
on
the
magnetism
of
flame
and
gases
on
action
and
on
atmospheric
magnetism
in
its
relations
to
the
annual
and
diurnal
variation
of
the
needle
the
full
significance
of
which
is
still
to
be
shown
these
are
faraday
most
massive
discoveries
and
upon
them
his
fame
must
mainly
rest
but
even
without
them
sufficient
would
remain
to
secure
for
him
a
high
and
lasting
scientific
reputation
we
should
still
have
his
researches
on
the
liquefaction
of
gases
on
frictional
electricity
on
the
electricity
of
the
gymnotus
on
the
source
of
power
in
the
machine
the
last
two
investigations
being
untouched
in
the
foregoing
memoir
on
rotations
on
regelation
all
his
more
purely
chemical
researches
including
his
discovery
of
benzol
besides
these
he
published
a
multitude
of
minor
papers
most
of
which
in
some
way
or
other
illustrate
his
genius
i
have
made
no
allusion
to
his
power
and
sweetness
as
a
lecturer
taking
him
for
all
in
all
i
think
it
will
be
conceded
that
michael
faraday
was
the
greatest
experimental
philosopher
the
world
has
ever
seen
and
i
will
add
the
opinion
that
the
progress
of
future
research
will
tend
not
to
dim
or
to
diminish
but
to
enhance
and
glorify
the
labours
of
this
mighty
investigator
chapter
illustrations
of
character
thus
far
i
have
confined
myself
to
topics
mainly
interesting
to
the
man
of
science
endeavouring
however
to
treat
them
in
a
manner
unrepellent
to
the
general
reader
who
might
wish
to
obtain
a
notion
of
faraday
as
a
worker
on
others
will
fall
the
duty
of
presenting
to
the
world
a
picture
of
the
man
but
i
know
you
will
permit
me
to
add
to
the
foregoing
analysis
a
few
personal
reminiscences
and
remarks
tending
to
connect
faraday
with
a
wider
world
than
that
of
science
namely
with
the
general
human
heart
one
word
in
reference
to
his
married
life
in
addition
to
what
has
been
already
said
may
find
a
place
here
as
in
the
former
case
faraday
shall
be
his
own
spokesman
the
following
paragraph
though
written
in
the
third
person
is
from
his
hand
june
he
married
an
event
which
more
than
any
other
contributed
to
his
earthly
happiness
and
healthful
state
of
mind
the
union
has
continued
for
years
and
has
in
no
wise
changed
except
in
the
depth
and
strength
of
its
character
faraday
immediate
forefathers
lived
in
a
little
place
called
clapham
wood
hall
in
yorkshire
here
dwelt
robert
faraday
and
elizabeth
his
wife
who
had
ten
children
one
of
them
james
faraday
born
in
being
father
to
the
philosopher
a
family
tradition
exists
that
the
faradays
came
originally
from
ireland
faraday
himself
has
more
than
once
expressed
to
me
his
belief
that
his
blood
was
in
part
celtic
but
how
much
of
it
was
so
or
when
the
infusion
took
place
he
was
unable
to
say
he
could
imitate
the
irish
brogue
and
his
wonderful
vivacity
may
have
been
in
part
due
to
his
extraction
but
there
were
other
qualities
which
we
should
hardly
think
of
deriving
from
ireland
the
most
prominent
of
these
was
his
sense
of
order
which
ran
like
a
luminous
beam
through
all
the
transactions
of
his
life
the
most
entangled
and
complicated
matters
fell
into
harmony
in
his
hands
his
mode
of
keeping
accounts
excited
the
admiration
of
the
managing
board
of
this
institution
and
his
science
was
similarly
ordered
in
his
experimental
researches
he
numbered
every
paragraph
and
welded
their
various
parts
together
by
incessant
reference
his
private
notes
of
the
experimental
researches
which
are
happily
preserved
are
similarly
numbered
their
last
paragraph
bears
the
figure
his
working
qualities
moreover
showed
the
tenacity
of
the
teuton
his
nature
was
impulsive
but
there
was
a
force
behind
the
impulse
which
did
not
permit
it
to
retreat
if
in
his
warm
moments
he
formed
a
resolution
in
his
cool
ones
he
made
that
resolution
good
thus
his
fire
was
that
of
a
solid
combustible
not
that
of
a
gas
which
blazes
suddenly
and
dies
as
suddenly
away
and
here
i
must
claim
your
tolerance
for
the
limits
by
which
i
am
confined
no
materials
for
a
life
of
faraday
are
in
my
hands
and
what
i
have
now
to
say
has
arisen
almost
wholly
out
of
our
close
personal
relationship
letters
of
his
covering
a
period
of
sixteen
years
are
before
me
each
one
of
which
contains
some
characteristic
utterance
strong
yet
delicate
in
counsel
joyful
in
encouragement
and
warm
in
affection
references
which
would
be
pleasant
to
such
of
them
as
still
live
are
made
to
humboldt
biot
dumas
chevreul
magnus
and
arago
accident
brought
these
names
prominently
forward
but
many
others
would
be
required
to
complete
his
list
of
continental
friends
he
prized
the
love
and
sympathy
of
men
prized
it
almost
more
than
the
renown
which
his
science
brought
him
nearly
a
dozen
years
ago
it
fell
to
my
lot
to
write
a
review
of
his
researches
for
the
magazine
after
he
had
read
it
he
took
me
by
the
hand
and
said
the
sweetest
reward
of
my
work
is
the
sympathy
and
good
will
which
it
has
caused
to
flow
in
upon
me
from
all
quarters
of
the
world
among
his
letters
i
find
little
sparks
of
kindness
precious
to
no
one
but
myself
but
more
precious
to
me
than
all
he
would
peep
into
the
laboratory
when
he
thought
me
weary
and
take
me
upstairs
with
him
to
rest
and
if
i
happened
to
be
absent
he
would
leave
a
little
note
for
me
couched
in
this
or
some
other
similar
form
tyndall
i
was
looking
for
you
because
we
were
at
tea
we
have
not
yet
done
will
you
come
up
i
frequently
shared
his
early
dinner
almost
always
in
fact
while
my
lectures
were
going
on
there
was
no
trace
of
asceticism
in
his
nature
he
preferred
the
meat
and
wine
of
life
to
its
locusts
and
wild
honey
never
once
during
an
intimacy
of
fifteen
years
did
he
mention
religion
to
me
save
when
i
drew
him
on
to
the
subject
he
then
spoke
to
me
without
hesitation
or
reluctance
not
with
any
apparent
desire
to
the
occasion
but
to
give
me
such
information
as
i
sought
he
believed
the
human
heart
to
be
swayed
by
a
power
to
which
science
or
logic
opened
no
approach
and
right
or
wrong
this
faith
held
in
perfect
tolerance
of
the
faiths
of
others
strengthened
and
beautified
his
life
from
the
letters
just
referred
to
i
will
select
three
for
publication
here
i
choose
the
first
because
it
contains
a
passage
revealing
the
feelings
with
which
faraday
regarded
his
vocation
and
also
because
it
contains
an
allusion
which
will
give
pleasure
to
a
friend
institution
this
is
crossed
out
by
faraday
isle
of
wight
june
dear
tyndall
you
see
by
the
top
of
this
letter
how
much
habit
prevails
over
me
i
have
just
read
yours
from
thence
and
yet
i
think
myself
there
however
i
have
left
its
science
in
very
good
keeping
and
i
am
glad
to
learn
that
you
are
at
experiment
once
more
but
how
is
the
health
not
well
i
fear
i
wish
you
would
get
yourself
strong
first
and
work
afterwards
as
for
the
fruits
i
am
sure
they
will
be
good
for
though
i
sometimes
despond
as
regards
myself
i
do
not
as
regards
you
you
are
young
i
am
old
but
then
our
subjects
are
so
glorious
that
to
work
at
them
rejoices
and
encourages
the
feeblest
delights
and
enchants
the
strongest
have
not
yet
seen
anything
from
magnus
thoughts
of
him
always
delight
me
we
shall
look
at
his
black
sulphur
together
i
heard
from
schonbein
the
other
day
he
tells
me
that
liebig
is
full
of
ozone
of
allotropic
oxygen
for
the
present
my
dear
tyndall
truly
faraday
the
contemplation
of
nature
and
his
own
relation
to
her
produced
in
faraday
a
kind
of
spiritual
exaltation
which
makes
itself
manifest
here
his
religious
feeling
and
his
philosophy
could
not
be
kept
apart
there
was
an
habitual
overflow
of
the
one
into
the
other
whether
he
or
another
was
its
exponent
he
appeared
to
take
equal
delight
in
science
a
good
experiment
would
make
him
almost
dance
with
delight
in
november
he
wrote
to
me
thus
hope
some
day
to
take
up
the
point
respecting
the
magnetism
of
associated
particles
in
the
meantime
i
rejoice
at
every
addition
to
the
facts
and
reasoning
connected
with
the
subject
when
science
is
a
republic
then
it
gains
and
though
i
am
no
republican
in
other
matters
i
am
in
that
all
his
letters
illustrate
this
catholicity
of
feeling
ten
years
ago
when
going
down
to
brighton
he
carried
with
him
a
little
paper
i
had
just
completed
and
afterwards
wrote
to
me
his
letter
is
a
mere
sample
of
the
sympathy
which
he
always
showed
to
me
and
my
work
december
dear
tyndall
i
can
not
resist
the
pleasure
of
saying
how
very
much
i
have
enjoyed
your
paper
every
part
has
given
me
delight
it
goes
on
from
point
to
point
beautifully
you
will
find
many
pencil
marks
for
i
made
them
as
i
read
i
let
them
stand
for
though
many
of
them
receive
their
answer
as
the
story
proceeds
yet
they
show
how
the
wording
impresses
a
mind
fresh
to
the
subject
and
perhaps
here
and
there
you
may
like
to
alter
it
slightly
if
you
wish
the
full
idea
not
an
inaccurate
one
to
be
suggested
at
first
and
yet
after
all
i
believe
it
is
not
your
exposition
but
the
natural
jumping
to
a
conclusion
that
affects
or
has
affected
my
pencil
return
on
friday
when
i
will
return
you
the
paper
truly
yours
faraday
the
third
letter
will
come
in
its
proper
place
towards
the
end
while
once
conversing
with
faraday
on
science
in
its
relations
to
commerce
and
litigation
he
said
to
me
that
at
a
certain
period
of
his
career
he
was
forced
definitely
to
ask
himself
and
finally
to
decide
whether
he
should
make
wealth
or
science
the
pursuit
of
his
life
he
could
not
serve
both
masters
and
he
was
therefore
compelled
to
choose
between
them
after
the
discovery
of
his
fame
was
so
noised
abroad
that
the
commercial
world
would
hardly
have
considered
any
remuneration
too
high
for
the
aid
of
abilities
like
his
even
before
he
became
so
famous
he
had
done
a
little
business
this
was
the
phrase
he
applied
to
his
purely
commercial
work
his
friend
richard
phillips
for
example
had
induced
him
to
undertake
a
number
of
analyses
which
produced
in
the
year
an
addition
to
his
income
of
more
than
a
thousand
pounds
and
in
a
still
greater
addition
he
had
only
to
will
it
to
raise
in
his
professional
business
income
to
a
year
indeed
double
this
sum
would
be
a
wholly
insufficient
estimate
of
what
he
might
with
ease
have
realised
annually
during
the
last
thirty
years
of
his
life
while
restudying
the
experimental
researches
with
reference
to
the
present
memoir
the
conversation
with
faraday
here
alluded
to
came
to
my
recollection
and
i
sought
to
ascertain
the
period
when
the
question
or
science
had
presented
itself
with
such
emphasis
to
his
mind
i
fixed
upon
the
year
or
for
it
seemed
beyond
the
range
of
human
power
to
pursue
science
as
he
had
done
during
the
subsequent
years
and
to
pursue
commercial
work
at
the
same
time
to
test
this
conclusion
i
asked
permission
to
see
his
accounts
and
on
my
own
responsibility
i
will
state
the
result
in
his
professional
business
income
instead
of
rising
to
or
more
fell
from
to
from
this
it
fell
with
slight
oscillations
to
in
and
to
zero
in
between
and
it
never
except
in
one
instance
exceeded
being
for
the
most
part
much
under
this
the
exceptional
year
referred
to
was
that
in
which
he
and
sir
charles
lyell
were
engaged
by
government
to
write
a
report
on
the
haswell
colliery
explosion
and
then
his
business
income
rose
to
from
the
end
of
to
the
day
of
his
death
faraday
annual
professional
business
income
was
exactly
zero
taking
the
duration
of
his
life
into
account
this
son
of
a
blacksmith
and
apprentice
to
a
bookbinder
had
to
decide
between
a
fortune
of
on
the
one
side
and
his
undowered
science
on
the
other
he
chose
the
latter
and
died
a
poor
man
but
his
was
the
glory
of
holding
aloft
among
the
nations
the
scientific
name
of
england
for
a
period
of
forty
years
the
outward
and
visible
signs
of
fame
were
also
of
less
account
to
him
than
to
most
men
he
had
been
loaded
with
scientific
honours
from
all
parts
of
the
world
without
i
imagine
a
dissentient
voice
he
was
regarded
as
the
prince
of
the
physical
investigators
of
the
present
age
the
highest
scientific
position
in
this
country
he
had
however
never
filled
when
the
late
excellent
and
lamented
lord
wrottesley
resigned
the
presidency
of
the
royal
society
a
deputation
from
the
council
consisting
of
his
lordship
grove
and
gassiot
waited
upon
faraday
to
urge
him
to
accept
the
president
chair
all
that
argument
or
friendly
persuasion
could
do
was
done
to
induce
him
to
yield
to
the
wishes
of
the
council
which
was
also
the
unanimous
wish
of
scientific
men
a
knowledge
of
the
quickness
of
his
own
nature
had
induced
in
faraday
the
habit
of
requiring
an
interval
of
reflection
before
he
decided
upon
any
question
of
importance
in
the
present
instance
he
followed
his
usual
habit
and
begged
for
a
little
time
on
the
following
morning
i
went
up
to
his
room
and
said
on
entering
that
i
had
come
to
him
with
some
anxiety
of
mind
he
demanded
its
cause
and
i
responded
you
should
have
decided
against
the
wishes
of
the
deputation
that
waited
on
you
yesterday
would
not
urge
me
to
undertake
this
responsibility
he
said
not
only
urge
you
was
my
reply
i
consider
it
your
bounden
duty
to
accept
it
he
spoke
of
the
labour
that
it
would
involve
urged
that
it
was
not
in
his
nature
to
take
things
easy
and
that
if
he
became
president
he
would
surely
have
to
stir
many
new
questions
and
agitate
for
some
changes
i
said
that
in
such
cases
he
would
find
himself
supported
by
the
youth
and
strength
of
the
royal
society
this
however
did
not
seem
to
satisfy
him
faraday
came
into
the
room
and
he
appealed
to
her
her
decision
was
adverse
and
i
deprecated
her
decision
he
said
at
length
must
remain
plain
michael
faraday
to
the
last
and
let
me
now
tell
you
that
if
i
accepted
the
honour
which
the
royal
society
desires
to
confer
upon
me
i
would
not
answer
for
the
integrity
of
my
intellect
for
a
single
year
i
urged
him
no
more
and
lord
wrottesley
had
a
most
worthy
successor
in
sir
benjamin
brodie
after
the
death
of
the
duke
of
northumberland
our
board
of
managers
wished
to
see
faraday
finish
his
career
as
president
of
the
institution
which
he
had
entered
on
weekly
wages
more
than
half
a
century
before
but
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
presidency
he
wished
for
rest
and
the
reverent
affection
of
his
friends
was
to
him
infinitely
more
precious
than
all
the
honours
of
official
life
the
first
requisite
of
the
intellectual
life
of
faraday
was
the
independence
of
his
mind
and
though
prompt
to
urge
obedience
where
obedience
was
due
with
every
right
assertion
of
manhood
he
intensely
sympathized
even
rashness
on
the
side
of
honour
found
from
him
ready
forgiveness
if
not
open
applause
the
wisdom
of
years
tempered
by
a
character
of
this
kind
rendered
his
counsel
peculiarly
precious
to
men
sensitive
like
himself
i
often
sought
that
counsel
and
with
your
permission
will
illustrate
its
character
by
one
or
two
typical
instances
in
i
was
appointed
examiner
under
the
council
for
military
education
at
that
time
as
indeed
now
i
entertained
strong
convictions
as
to
the
enormous
utility
of
physical
science
to
officers
of
artillery
and
engineers
and
whenever
opportunity
offered
i
expressed
this
conviction
without
reserve
i
did
not
think
the
recognition
though
considerable
accorded
to
physical
science
in
those
examinations
at
all
proportionate
to
its
importance
and
this
probably
rendered
me
more
jealous
than
i
otherwise
should
have
been
of
its
claims
in
trinity
college
dublin
a
school
had
been
organized
with
reference
to
the
woolwich
examinations
and
a
large
number
of
exceedingly
young
gentlemen
were
sent
over
from
dublin
to
compete
for
appointments
in
the
artillery
and
the
engineers
the
result
of
one
examination
was
particularly
satisfactory
to
me
indeed
the
marks
obtained
appeared
so
eloquent
that
i
forbore
saying
a
word
about
them
my
colleagues
however
followed
the
usual
custom
of
sending
in
brief
reports
with
their
returns
of
marks
after
the
results
were
published
a
leading
article
appeared
in
times
in
which
the
reports
were
largely
quoted
praise
being
bestowed
on
all
the
candidates
except
the
excellent
young
fellows
who
had
passed
through
my
hands
a
letter
from
trinity
college
drew
my
attention
to
this
article
bitterly
complaining
that
whereas
the
marks
proved
them
to
be
the
best
of
all
the
science
candidates
were
wholly
ignored
i
tried
to
set
matters
right
by
publishing
on
my
own
responsibility
a
letter
in
times
the
act
i
knew
could
not
bear
justification
from
the
war
office
point
of
view
and
i
expected
and
risked
the
displeasure
of
my
superiors
the
merited
reprimand
promptly
came
as
the
secretary
of
state
for
war
might
value
the
expression
of
professor
opinion
he
begged
to
say
that
an
examiner
appointed
by
his
royal
highness
the
had
no
right
to
appear
in
the
public
papers
as
professor
tyndall
has
done
without
the
sanction
of
the
war
office
nothing
could
be
more
just
than
this
reproof
but
i
did
not
like
to
rest
under
it
i
wrote
a
reply
and
previous
to
sending
it
took
it
up
to
faraday
we
sat
together
before
his
fire
and
he
looked
very
earnest
as
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
pondered
the
following
conversation
then
passed
between
us
you
certainly
have
received
a
reprimand
tyndall
but
the
matter
is
over
and
if
you
wish
to
accept
the
reproof
you
will
hear
no
more
about
it
but
i
do
not
wish
to
accept
it
then
you
know
what
the
consequence
of
sending
that
letter
will
be
i
do
they
will
dismiss
you
i
know
it
then
send
the
letter
the
letter
was
firm
but
respectful
it
acknowledged
the
justice
of
the
censure
but
expressed
neither
repentance
nor
regret
faraday
in
his
gracious
way
slightly
altered
a
sentence
or
two
to
make
it
more
respectful
still
it
was
duly
sent
and
on
the
following
day
i
entered
the
institution
with
the
conviction
that
my
dismissal
was
there
before
me
weeks
however
passed
at
length
the
envelope
appeared
and
i
broke
the
seal
not
doubting
the
contents
they
were
very
different
from
what
i
expected
secretary
of
state
for
war
has
received
professor
tyndall
letter
and
deems
the
explanation
therein
given
perfectly
satisfactory
i
have
often
wished
for
an
opportunity
of
publicly
acknowledging
this
liberal
treatment
proving
as
it
did
that
lord
panmure
could
discern
and
make
allowance
for
a
good
intention
though
it
involved
an
offence
against
routine
for
many
years
subsequently
it
was
my
privilege
to
act
under
that
excellent
body
the
council
for
military
education
on
another
occasion
of
this
kind
having
encouraged
me
in
a
somewhat
hardy
resolution
i
had
formed
faraday
backed
his
encouragement
by
an
illustration
drawn
from
his
own
life
the
subject
will
interest
you
and
it
is
so
sure
to
be
talked
about
in
the
world
that
no
avoidable
harm
can
rise
from
its
introduction
here
in
the
year
sir
robert
peel
wished
to
offer
faraday
a
pension
but
that
great
statesman
quitted
office
before
he
was
able
to
realise
his
wish
the
minister
who
founded
these
pensions
intended
them
i
believe
to
be
marks
of
honour
which
even
proud
men
might
accept
without
compromise
of
independence
when
however
the
intimation
first
reached
faraday
in
an
unofficial
way
he
wrote
a
letter
announcing
his
determination
to
decline
the
pension
and
stating
that
he
was
quite
competent
to
earn
his
livelihood
himself
that
letter
still
exists
but
it
was
never
sent
faraday
repugnance
having
been
overruled
by
his
friends
when
lord
melbourne
came
into
office
he
desired
to
see
faraday
and
probably
in
utter
ignorance
of
the
man
for
unhappily
for
them
and
us
ministers
of
state
in
england
are
only
too
often
ignorant
of
great
englishmen
his
lordship
said
something
that
must
have
deeply
displeased
his
visitor
all
the
circumstances
were
once
communicated
to
me
but
i
have
forgotten
the
details
the
term
i
think
was
incautiously
employed
by
his
lordship
and
other
expressions
were
used
of
a
similar
kind
faraday
quitted
the
minister
with
his
own
resolves
and
that
evening
he
left
his
card
and
a
short
and
decisive
note
at
the
residence
of
lord
melbourne
stating
that
he
had
manifestly
mistaken
his
lordship
intention
of
honouring
science
in
his
person
and
declining
to
have
anything
whatever
to
do
with
the
proposed
pension
the
nobleman
at
first
considered
the
matter
a
capital
joke
but
he
was
afterwards
led
to
look
at
it
more
seriously
an
excellent
lady
who
was
a
friend
both
to
faraday
and
the
minister
tried
to
arrange
matters
between
them
but
she
found
faraday
very
difficult
to
move
from
the
position
he
had
assumed
after
many
fruitless
efforts
she
at
length
begged
of
him
to
state
what
he
would
require
of
lord
melbourne
to
induce
him
to
change
his
mind
he
replied
should
require
from
his
lordship
what
i
have
no
right
or
reason
to
expect
that
he
would
grant
a
written
apology
for
the
words
he
permitted
himself
to
use
to
me
the
required
apology
came
frank
and
full
creditable
i
thought
alike
to
the
prime
minister
and
the
philosopher
considering
the
enormous
strain
imposed
on
faraday
intellect
the
buoyancy
even
of
his
later
years
was
astonishing
he
was
often
prostrate
but
he
had
immense
resiliency
which
he
brought
into
action
by
getting
away
from
london
whenever
his
health
failed
i
have
already
indicated
the
thoughts
which
filled
his
mind
during
the
evening
of
his
life
he
brooded
on
magnetic
media
and
lines
of
force
and
the
great
object
of
the
last
investigation
he
ever
undertook
was
the
decision
of
the
question
whether
magnetic
force
requires
time
for
its
propagation
how
he
proposed
to
attack
this
subject
we
may
never
know
but
he
has
left
some
beautiful
apparatus
behind
delicate
wheels
and
pinions
and
associated
mirrors
which
were
to
have
been
employed
in
the
investigation
the
mere
conception
of
such
an
inquiry
is
an
illustration
of
his
strength
and
hopefulness
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
to
what
results
it
might
have
led
him
but
the
work
was
too
heavy
for
his
tired
brain
it
was
long
before
he
could
bring
himself
to
relinquish
it
and
during
this
struggle
he
often
suffered
from
fatigue
of
mind
it
was
at
this
period
and
before
he
resigned
himself
to
the
repose
which
marked
the
last
two
years
of
his
life
that
he
wrote
to
me
the
following
letter
one
of
many
priceless
letters
now
before
me
which
reveals
more
than
anything
another
pen
could
express
the
state
of
his
mind
at
the
time
i
was
sometimes
censured
in
his
presence
for
my
doings
in
the
alps
but
his
constant
reply
was
him
alone
he
knows
how
to
take
care
of
himself
in
this
letter
anxiety
on
this
score
reveals
itself
for
the
first
time
court
august
dear
tyndall
i
do
not
know
whether
my
letter
will
catch
you
but
i
will
risk
it
though
feeling
very
unfit
to
communicate
with
a
man
whose
life
is
as
vivid
and
active
as
yours
but
the
receipt
of
your
kind
letter
makes
me
to
know
that
though
i
forget
i
am
not
forgotten
and
though
i
am
not
able
to
remember
at
the
end
of
a
line
what
was
said
at
the
beginning
of
it
the
imperfect
marks
will
convey
to
you
some
sense
of
what
i
long
to
say
we
had
heard
of
your
illness
through
miss
moore
and
i
was
therefore
very
glad
to
learn
that
you
are
now
quite
well
do
not
run
too
many
risks
or
make
your
happiness
depend
too
much
upon
dangers
or
the
hunting
of
them
sometimes
the
very
thinking
of
you
and
what
you
may
be
about
wearies
me
with
fears
and
then
the
cogitations
pause
and
change
but
without
giving
me
rest
i
know
that
much
of
this
depends
upon
my
own
nature
and
i
do
not
know
why
i
write
it
save
that
when
i
write
to
you
i
can
not
help
thinking
it
and
the
thoughts
stand
in
the
way
of
other
matter
what
a
strange
desultory
epistle
i
am
writing
to
you
and
yet
i
feel
so
weary
that
i
long
to
leave
my
desk
and
go
to
the
couch
dear
wife
and
jane
desire
their
kindest
remembrances
i
hear
them
in
the
next
room
i
forget
but
not
you
my
dear
tyndall
for
i
am
yours
faraday
this
weariness
subsided
when
he
relinquished
his
work
and
i
have
a
cheerful
letter
from
him
written
in
the
autumn
of
but
towards
the
close
of
that
year
he
had
an
attack
of
illness
from
which
he
never
completely
rallied
he
continued
to
attend
the
friday
evening
meetings
but
the
advance
of
infirmity
was
apparent
to
us
all
complete
rest
became
finally
essential
to
him
and
he
ceased
to
appear
among
us
there
was
no
pain
in
his
decline
to
trouble
the
memory
of
those
who
loved
him
slowly
and
peacefully
he
sank
towards
his
final
rest
and
when
it
came
his
death
was
a
falling
asleep
in
the
fulness
of
his
honours
and
of
his
age
he
quitted
us
the
good
fight
fought
the
work
of
duty
shall
i
not
say
of
glory
done
the
referred
to
in
the
foregoing
letter
is
faraday
niece
miss
jane
barnard
who
with
an
affection
raised
almost
to
religious
devotion
watched
him
and
tended
him
to
the
end
i
saw
faraday
for
the
first
time
on
my
return
from
marburg
in
i
came
to
the
royal
institution
and
sent
up
my
card
with
a
copy
of
the
paper
which
knoblauch
and
myself
had
just
completed
he
came
down
and
conversed
with
me
for
half
an
hour
i
could
not
fail
to
remark
the
wonderful
play
of
intellect
and
kindly
feeling
exhibited
by
his
countenance
when
he
was
in
good
health
the
question
of
his
age
would
never
occur
to
you
in
the
light
and
laughter
of
his
eyes
you
never
thought
of
his
grey
hairs
he
was
then
on
the
point
of
publishing
one
of
his
papers
on
magnecrystallic
action
and
he
had
time
to
refer
in
a
flattering
note
to
the
memoir
i
placed
in
his
hands
i
returned
to
germany
worked
there
for
nearly
another
year
and
in
june
came
back
finally
from
berlin
to
england
then
for
the
first
time
and
on
my
way
to
the
meeting
of
the
british
association
at
ipswich
i
met
a
man
who
has
since
made
his
mark
upon
the
intellect
of
his
time
who
has
long
been
and
who
by
the
strong
law
of
natural
affinity
must
continue
to
be
a
brother
to
me
we
were
both
without
definite
outlook
at
the
time
needing
proper
work
and
only
anxious
to
have
it
to
perform
the
chairs
of
natural
history
and
of
physics
being
advertised
as
vacant
in
the
university
of
toronto
we
applied
for
them
he
for
the
one
i
for
the
other
but
possibly
guided
by
a
prophetic
instinct
the
university
authorities
declined
having
anything
to
do
with
either
of
us
if
i
remember
aright
we
were
equally
unlucky
elsewhere
one
of
faraday
earliest
letters
to
me
had
reference
to
this
toronto
business
which
he
thought
it
unwise
in
me
to
neglect
but
toronto
had
its
own
notions
and
in
at
the
instance
of
bence
jones
and
on
the
recommendation
of
faraday
himself
a
chair
of
physics
at
the
royal
institution
was
offered
to
me
i
was
tempted
at
the
same
time
to
go
elsewhere
but
a
strong
attraction
drew
me
to
his
side
let
me
say
that
it
was
mainly
his
and
other
friendships
precious
to
me
beyond
all
expression
that
caused
me
to
value
my
position
here
more
highly
than
any
other
that
could
be
offered
to
me
in
this
land
nor
is
it
for
its
honour
though
surely
that
is
great
but
for
the
strong
personal
ties
that
bind
me
to
it
that
i
now
chiefly
prize
this
place
you
might
not
credit
me
were
i
to
tell
you
how
lightly
i
value
the
honour
of
being
faraday
successor
compared
with
the
honour
of
having
been
friend
his
friendship
was
energy
and
inspiration
his
is
a
burden
almost
too
heavy
to
be
borne
sometimes
during
the
last
year
of
his
life
by
the
permission
or
invitation
of
faraday
i
went
up
to
his
rooms
to
see
him
the
deep
radiance
which
in
his
time
of
strength
flashed
with
such
extraordinary
power
from
his
countenance
had
subsided
to
a
calm
and
kindly
light
by
which
my
latest
memory
of
him
is
warmed
and
illuminated
i
knelt
one
day
beside
him
on
the
carpet
and
placed
my
hand
upon
his
knee
he
stroked
it
affectionately
smiled
and
murmured
in
a
low
soft
voice
the
last
words
that
i
remember
as
having
been
spoken
to
me
by
michael
faraday
it
was
my
wish
and
aspiration
to
play
the
part
of
schiller
to
this
goethe
and
he
was
at
times
so
strong
and
joyful
his
body
so
active
and
his
intellect
so
clear
as
to
suggest
to
me
the
thought
that
he
like
goethe
would
see
the
younger
man
laid
low
destiny
ruled
otherwise
and
now
he
is
but
a
memory
to
us
all
surely
no
memory
could
be
more
beautiful
he
was
equally
rich
in
mind
and
heart
the
fairest
traits
of
a
character
sketched
by
paul
found
in
him
perfect
illustration
for
he
was
vigilant
sober
of
good
behaviour
apt
to
teach
not
given
to
filthy
lucre
he
had
not
a
trace
of
worldly
ambition
he
declared
his
duty
to
his
sovereign
by
going
to
the
levee
once
a
year
but
beyond
this
he
never
sought
contact
with
the
great
the
life
of
his
spirit
and
of
his
intellect
was
so
full
that
the
things
which
men
most
strive
after
were
absolutely
indifferent
to
him
me
health
and
a
day
says
the
brave
emerson
i
will
make
the
pomp
of
emperors
ridiculous
in
an
eminent
degree
faraday
could
say
the
same
what
to
him
was
the
splendour
of
a
palace
compared
with
a
thunderstorm
upon
brighton
downs
what
among
all
the
appliances
of
royalty
to
compare
with
the
setting
sun
i
refer
to
a
thunderstorm
and
a
sunset
because
these
things
excited
a
kind
of
ecstasy
in
his
mind
and
to
a
mind
open
to
such
ecstasy
the
pomps
and
pleasures
of
the
world
are
usually
of
small
account
nature
not
education
rendered
faraday
strong
and
refined
a
favourite
experiment
of
his
own
was
representative
of
himself
he
loved
to
show
that
water
in
crystallizing
excluded
all
foreign
ingredients
however
intimately
they
might
be
mixed
with
it
out
of
acids
alkalis
or
saline
solutions
the
crystal
came
sweet
and
pure
by
some
such
natural
process
in
the
formation
of
this
man
beauty
and
nobleness
coalesced
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
vulgar
and
low
he
did
not
learn
his
gentleness
in
the
world
for
he
withdrew
himself
from
its
culture
and
still
this
land
of
england
contained
no
truer
gentleman
than
he
not
half
his
greatness
was
incorporate
in
his
science
for
science
could
not
reveal
the
bravery
and
delicacy
of
his
heart
but
it
is
time
that
i
should
end
these
weak
words
and
lay
my
poor
garland
on
the
grave
of
this
just
and
faithful
knight
of
god
