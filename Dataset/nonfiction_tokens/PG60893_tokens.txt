preface
the
progress
of
educational
thought
during
the
closing
years
of
this
century
has
been
marvellous
professional
schools
have
created
a
demand
for
professional
teaching
by
giving
an
increasing
group
of
skilled
instructors
to
our
schools
this
professional
activity
has
caused
our
leading
cities
to
provide
as
integral
parts
of
the
city
system
of
education
finally
our
great
universities
have
established
departments
of
pedagogy
for
the
higher
training
in
education
as
a
result
the
leading
positions
in
higher
schools
and
in
supervision
are
more
and
more
demanding
professionally
trained
leaders
in
this
auspicious
awakening
for
professional
leadership
there
has
come
an
increasing
demand
for
standard
treatises
upon
the
fundamental
problems
of
education
treatises
upon
the
history
methods
principles
and
systems
of
education
have
appeared
with
astonishing
frequency
that
many
of
these
are
commercial
to
doubtless
true
there
is
always
a
great
temptation
to
profit
by
an
active
demand
but
not
always
widely
trained
and
broadly
cultured
teachers
who
have
achieved
a
local
success
with
a
method
that
owed
its
virtue
to
the
personality
of
its
author
and
not
to
its
intrinsic
worth
have
been
tempted
into
authorship
the
wiser
and
nobler
minds
in
the
profession
wait
the
days
of
unrest
and
experimentation
breeding
discord
and
confusion
have
in
part
passed
away
and
the
time
has
come
when
the
products
of
all
this
divergent
activity
may
be
put
to
the
test
of
clear
analysis
and
adequate
experience
this
is
especially
true
in
the
domains
of
historic
and
philosophic
inquiry
in
experimental
activity
touching
the
problems
of
psychic
life
as
related
to
its
sensorium
much
has
been
done
in
a
tentative
way
much
must
yet
be
done
to
produce
results
of
enduring
significance
this
series
of
educational
treatises
is
projected
to
give
inquiring
minds
the
best
thought
of
our
present
professional
life
fundamental
problems
in
education
will
be
exhibited
in
the
series
from
time
to
time
by
thoroughly
trained
leaders
of
extended
experience
teachers
may
confidently
accept
these
as
authoritative
discussions
of
the
cardinal
questions
of
their
profession
the
highest
endowment
of
the
human
spirit
on
the
intellectual
side
is
the
power
to
think
learning
to
think
is
an
essential
process
and
end
in
all
school
work
thinking
is
the
regal
activity
in
a
vague
way
all
teaching
appeals
to
the
of
the
pupil
but
vagueness
in
teaching
is
as
pernicious
as
it
is
common
to
exhibit
the
value
scope
and
process
of
thought
is
of
inestimable
service
to
the
teacher
it
gives
specific
direction
to
teaching
processes
and
saves
the
child
from
a
thousand
fanciful
expedients
in
the
craze
of
the
passing
decade
for
novelty
in
teaching
there
has
resulted
an
undue
emphasis
upon
forms
of
expressional
activity
it
has
been
in
many
quarters
forgotten
that
education
is
noblest
when
it
produces
reflective
activity
the
power
to
analyze
and
synthetize
is
the
most
fruitful
endowment
of
the
intellectual
life
expression
without
adequate
reflection
is
productive
of
superficiality
we
have
been
living
a
life
of
educational
expedients
the
path
of
educational
advance
is
strewn
with
countless
practices
which
once
claimed
attention
largely
because
of
the
feeling
among
too
many
that
the
newest
theory
is
the
best
there
has
come
let
us
hope
the
more
rational
resolve
to
test
all
new
and
loudly
heralded
theories
by
fundamental
laws
of
mental
activity
to
emphasize
the
significance
of
this
reaction
and
to
afford
helpful
criteria
of
educational
processes
this
volume
will
be
found
most
stimulating
suggestive
and
sensible
for
the
purposes
of
the
teacher
thinking
may
be
distinguished
as
follows
by
which
one
is
to
understand
thinking
the
thing
and
not
some
other
thing
in
its
stead
much
thinking
is
not
clear
the
power
of
recall
is
not
fully
developed
the
mind
acts
but
is
not
able
to
assert
confidently
the
accuracy
of
what
it
acts
upon
much
needless
criticism
is
heaped
upon
schools
because
pupils
can
not
spell
correctly
solve
problems
accurately
recite
a
lesson
in
history
or
in
geography
properly
short
because
the
knowledge
is
not
clear
the
first
step
in
all
true
teaching
is
the
step
that
makes
clear
to
the
pupil
the
thing
he
is
to
think
by
which
one
is
to
understand
thinking
the
thing
in
its
relations
this
phase
of
thinking
is
sometimes
called
apperception
it
is
the
second
and
not
the
first
step
in
thinking
there
is
no
value
in
teaching
relations
until
the
things
to
be
related
are
first
clearly
apprehended
perception
must
precede
apperception
the
pupil
in
the
elementary
school
has
been
well
taught
if
he
has
been
taught
to
think
clearly
and
distinctly
by
which
one
is
to
understand
thinking
the
thing
in
its
essential
parts
this
is
the
analytic
form
of
thought
the
child
at
first
can
not
think
adequately
his
mind
thinks
things
as
wholes
he
has
not
the
power
to
think
the
whole
and
its
parts
as
parts
of
the
whole
simultaneously
he
must
rise
to
adequate
thinking
only
after
clear
and
distinct
thinking
have
become
habits
of
mind
the
fuller
phase
of
this
activity
by
which
these
analyzed
parts
are
synthetically
wrought
into
an
organic
unity
is
the
process
of
essential
prerequisite
of
all
high
orders
of
thought
this
power
every
teacher
should
possess
it
is
his
surplus
of
knowledge
the
possession
of
which
makes
him
easily
master
in
the
teaching
process
by
which
one
is
to
understand
thinking
the
thing
in
its
causes
this
is
the
highest
form
of
thinking
the
thing
it
gives
perspective
to
and
eliminates
all
accidental
and
misleading
elements
from
the
categories
of
thought
to
achieve
this
one
must
specialize
the
teaching
of
the
future
must
be
more
and
more
intensive
in
scope
the
day
of
the
encyclopædist
is
gone
the
teacher
of
must
be
a
teacher
who
knows
one
order
of
truth
exhaustively
and
who
possesses
the
skill
to
incite
in
others
a
permanent
enthusiasm
for
that
order
of
truth
scientific
progress
is
conditioned
by
such
teaching
the
author
has
brought
to
this
discussion
the
matured
convictions
of
broad
training
in
american
and
european
systems
of
schools
and
a
wide
and
successful
experience
in
teaching
pupils
and
directing
systems
of
education
the
discussion
takes
on
the
modest
but
stimulating
style
of
the
public
speaker
the
author
has
for
many
years
been
among
our
foremost
lecturers
upon
education
the
temper
of
the
discussion
is
moderate
and
constructive
there
will
be
found
here
no
wild
excess
no
straining
after
fanciful
effect
no
advocacy
of
sensational
and
ephemeral
methods
nor
is
there
a
trace
of
pessimistic
and
destructive
criticism
of
the
earnest
teachers
who
are
conscious
of
limitations
and
are
reaching
hopefully
for
help
on
the
contrary
the
discussion
is
full
of
real
sympathy
founded
upon
personal
experience
with
teaching
in
all
its
phases
and
abounds
in
stimulating
suggestion
october
preface
for
a
number
of
years
it
has
been
the
duty
as
well
as
privilege
to
lecture
at
county
institutes
on
the
difficult
art
of
teaching
pupils
to
think
this
led
to
the
request
that
the
lectures
be
thrown
into
permanent
form
for
publication
the
lecturer
who
never
publishes
has
no
pet
theories
to
defend
he
can
change
his
views
as
often
as
he
sees
fit
yet
in
spite
of
this
advantage
he
can
not
always
escape
or
ignore
the
art
of
printing
one
who
gives
his
thoughts
to
the
public
without
the
use
of
manuscript
and
under
the
limitations
of
extemporaneous
speech
made
necessary
by
the
large
audiences
which
gather
at
institutes
especially
in
pennsylvania
runs
the
risk
of
being
misquoted
and
misunderstood
he
pays
the
penalty
of
being
reported
in
fragmentary
if
not
distorted
forms
this
ultimately
drives
him
in
justice
to
himself
and
others
to
write
out
his
theories
on
education
and
to
give
them
to
his
coworkers
in
print
portions
of
these
lectures
were
delivered
at
the
annual
meeting
of
the
superintendents
of
new
england
before
the
state
associations
of
massachusetts
rhode
island
and
florida
before
the
connecticut
council
of
education
before
the
summer
schools
held
under
the
auspices
of
the
ohio
state
university
and
the
university
of
wisconsin
and
at
several
of
the
meetings
of
the
national
educational
association
the
favorable
hearing
accorded
on
these
occasions
induces
the
hope
that
the
lectures
will
be
kindly
received
by
many
who
teach
outside
of
pennsylvania
and
by
some
who
give
instruction
in
our
higher
institutions
of
learning
although
no
one
can
hope
on
so
difficult
a
theme
to
say
much
that
will
be
entirely
satisfactory
to
leading
educators
surely
no
apology
is
needed
from
any
one
who
after
spending
his
best
years
in
educational
work
attempts
to
contribute
his
mite
towards
the
solution
of
any
of
the
problems
which
confront
the
teacher
it
is
assumed
that
there
is
a
body
of
educational
doctrine
well
established
in
the
minds
of
teachers
and
that
on
many
school
questions
we
have
advanced
beyond
the
border
line
of
first
discovery
those
who
assert
that
our
educational
practice
is
radically
wrong
and
in
need
of
thorough
reformation
should
hasten
to
clarify
their
own
views
and
ideas
to
substitute
constructive
for
destructive
criticism
and
to
give
definite
shape
to
their
reforms
otherwise
a
whole
generation
will
grow
to
maturity
and
the
reformers
themselves
will
pass
away
before
any
of
their
reforms
will
have
been
accomplished
to
give
teachers
the
feeling
that
what
they
are
doing
is
all
wrong
and
to
leave
them
without
anything
better
in
place
of
what
is
condemned
robs
them
of
joy
in
their
work
makes
them
victims
of
worry
and
neurasthenia
and
unfits
them
for
the
care
of
children
it
is
hoped
that
these
lectures
will
be
found
to
suggest
a
better
way
whenever
criticism
is
bestowed
upon
existing
methods
of
instruction
no
attempt
is
made
to
ridicule
the
psychologists
or
the
advocates
of
child
study
or
those
patient
and
painstaking
workers
who
are
honestly
seeking
to
establish
the
facts
of
mind
through
experiments
in
the
laboratory
he
who
has
carefully
reflected
upon
the
art
of
making
pupils
think
will
not
hesitate
to
admit
that
thus
far
he
has
received
more
light
from
the
standard
psychology
than
from
the
labors
of
those
who
claim
to
be
the
exponents
of
the
new
psychology
the
latter
can
hardly
write
or
talk
without
using
the
terms
coined
by
the
older
students
of
mind
this
shows
their
indebtedness
to
those
who
taught
and
speculated
before
laboratories
of
psychology
were
established
sometimes
the
experiments
have
only
served
to
test
and
give
a
reason
for
what
was
already
accepted
often
they
have
brought
to
our
knowledge
facts
of
mind
which
could
never
have
been
discovered
by
the
method
of
introspection
in
either
case
the
experiments
have
resulted
in
clear
gain
let
the
facts
of
brain
and
mind
of
nervous
and
mental
action
of
human
growth
maturity
and
decay
be
gathered
questioned
tested
and
classified
let
their
bearing
upon
educational
practice
be
set
forth
in
the
clearest
possible
light
every
resulting
step
of
progress
and
reform
will
be
hailed
with
delight
by
all
who
have
no
pet
theories
to
defend
the
lecturer
is
limited
by
time
by
the
kind
of
audience
which
he
addresses
and
by
circumstances
largely
beyond
his
control
these
limitations
drop
out
when
he
reduces
his
thoughts
to
writing
and
a
rearrangement
at
many
points
becomes
possible
as
well
as
desirable
the
expedients
for
relieving
the
strain
of
attention
and
winning
back
the
listless
can
be
omitted
and
omissions
that
become
necessary
through
the
exigencies
of
the
programme
must
be
supplied
for
the
sake
of
logical
sequence
moreover
the
aims
which
those
who
engage
the
lecturer
set
before
him
frequently
require
a
modification
of
the
line
of
discussion
so
that
a
course
of
lectures
on
a
specific
theme
can
not
always
follow
the
same
order
of
treatment
although
substantially
the
same
in
content
and
scope
hence
the
division
into
chapters
has
been
adopted
as
preferable
to
the
original
sequence
of
lectures
nevertheless
the
style
of
the
rostrum
has
not
been
altogether
eliminated
because
when
oral
discourse
is
thrown
into
new
forms
and
the
phraseology
is
changed
for
the
sake
of
publication
the
loss
in
vividness
directness
and
simplicity
is
greater
than
the
gain
in
diction
and
fulness
of
statement
lecturing
as
well
as
has
its
peculiar
temptations
the
lecturer
must
interest
his
hearers
in
order
to
hold
them
he
is
tempted
to
play
to
the
galleries
and
to
omit
what
is
beyond
the
comprehension
of
the
average
audience
the
on
the
other
hand
is
tempted
to
display
his
learning
to
make
a
show
of
depth
and
erudition
the
student
of
pedagogy
is
supposed
to
be
in
search
of
profound
wisdom
those
who
write
for
him
often
dive
so
deep
that
their
style
becomes
muddy
unfortunately
some
of
the
best
treatises
on
education
have
been
written
in
the
style
of
the
philosopher
and
wrought
out
on
the
plane
of
the
university
professor
although
intended
for
undergraduates
at
normal
schools
and
for
teachers
whose
meagre
salaries
do
not
enable
them
to
pursue
courses
of
study
at
institutions
of
higher
learning
the
lucid
style
of
treatise
on
has
done
much
to
counteract
this
tendency
yet
many
of
the
authors
of
our
treatises
on
pedagogy
seem
to
be
haunted
by
a
feeling
similar
to
that
of
the
german
professor
who
on
reading
the
opening
chapters
of
a
new
book
and
finding
them
to
be
intelligible
to
his
colleagues
exclaimed
i
must
rewrite
these
chapters
otherwise
nobody
will
read
my
book
huxley
has
well
described
the
penalty
which
must
be
paid
by
those
who
speak
or
write
for
the
purpose
of
being
understood
these
are
his
words
the
same
time
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
popularization
of
science
whether
by
lecture
or
essay
has
its
drawbacks
success
in
this
department
has
its
perils
for
those
who
succeed
the
who
take
their
revenge
as
we
have
recently
had
occasion
to
observe
by
ignoring
all
the
rest
of
a
work
and
glibly
labelling
him
a
mere
popularizer
if
the
falsehood
were
not
too
glaring
they
would
say
the
same
of
faraday
and
helmholtz
and
one
who
can
never
hope
to
rival
the
style
of
spencer
and
huxley
and
those
to
whom
the
latter
refers
will
nevertheless
do
well
to
emulate
their
skill
in
making
difficult
things
plain
to
people
who
are
not
specialists
or
experts
he
who
writes
for
the
teachers
in
our
public
schools
should
put
aside
his
ambition
to
be
considered
erudite
or
profound
and
endeavor
above
all
things
to
be
understood
vague
theories
are
apt
to
beget
a
bad
conscience
in
those
who
teach
and
to
destroy
the
joy
which
every
one
has
a
right
to
feel
while
doing
honest
and
faithful
work
hence
the
writer
offers
no
apology
for
heaping
illustration
upon
illustration
in
the
effort
to
make
his
meaning
plain
to
those
whom
he
aims
to
help
there
is
at
present
great
need
for
clear
thinking
and
luminous
presentation
of
facts
on
the
part
of
all
who
write
on
education
for
the
people
or
for
teachers
in
our
public
schools
by
a
process
similar
to
that
by
which
the
mediæval
imagination
swelled
the
murder
of
the
innocents
at
bethlehem
into
a
slaughter
of
thousands
of
children
there
can
not
have
been
many
male
children
two
years
old
and
under
in
a
small
judean
village
the
harm
which
some
pupils
suffer
is
magnified
into
a
national
crime
at
the
feet
of
american
parents
the
evils
which
result
from
societies

are

heighten
the
effect
of

upon

work
the
need
of

seems
far
less
urgent
and
teachers
instead
of
wasting
their
time
in
worry
and
uncertainty
begin
with
cheerful
heart
to
impart
that
which
modern
civilization
requires
every
child
to
know
as
a
condition
of
and
complete
living
there
is
of
course
a
worse
fault
than
obscurity
of
style
dearth
of
ideas
the
danger
to
which
the
lecturer
is
always
exposed

losing
his
hearers
and
failing
to
be

minds
may
leave
while
they
are

spurs
to
effort
in
two
directions
either
he
will
try
to
say
something
worth
listening
to
or
he
will
strive
to
entertain
by
amusing
stories
and
incidents
if
he
be
conscious
of
a
lack
of
talent
for
humor
he
will
try
to
stuff
his
lectures
full
of
sense
if
the
lectures
here
published
lack
in
this
respect
the
writer
is
willing
to
acknowledge
failure
in
preparing
a
course
of
lectures
it
is
proper
to
bear
in
mind
the
difference
between
the
lecturer
the
orator
the
poet
and
the
philosopher
the
philosopher
investigates
ideas
and
truths
explores
their
essence
and
relations
and
unfolds
them
in
their
deepest
unity
and
in
their
greatest
possible
compass
when
this
has
been
done
throughout
the
whole
domain
of
thought
his
mission
is
accomplished
the
poet
seeks
to
clothe
his
ideas
in
beautiful
forms
when
the
idea
is
perfectly
suited
to
the
form
and
the
form
to
the
idea
his
mission
is
accomplished
the
orator
aims
to
move
the
will
he
quotes
authorities
uses
ideas
appeals
to
the
feelings
and
subordinates
everything
to
the
one
end
of
gaining
a
verdict
winning
a
vote
or
getting
a
response
in
the
conduct
of
those
whom
he
addresses
the
lecturer
seeks
to
impart
information
he
aims
to
get
a
response
in
the
thinking
of
those
whom
he
addresses
he
tries
to
reach
the
intellect
rather
than
the
will
beautiful
language
and
exhaustive
treatment
are
not
essential
parts
of
his
mission
it
is
his
province
to
elucidate
the
theme
under
consideration
to
guide
the
efforts
and
inquiries
of
those
who
come
to
him
for
instruction
to
direct
them
to
the
sources
of
information
and
to
furnish
such
incentives
as
he
can
towards
independent
study
and
investigation
since
the
data
for
pedagogy
are
derived
mainly
from
kindred
fields
of
investigation
the
lecturer
on
the
science
and
art
of
education
has
frequent
occasion
to
cite
authorities
and
to
utilize
the
labors
and
conclusions
of
the
men
eminent
in
the
sciences
which
throw
light
upon
the
growth
of
the
child
more
especially
upon
the
development
of
mind
and
character
the
most
original
writers
quote
very
little
and
those
who
are
anxious
to
establish
a
reputation
for
originality
refrain
from
quoting
others
it
is
the
business
of
the
lecturer
to
lead
the
hearer
to
the
sources
of
information
when
anything
has
been
so
well
said
that
he
can
not
improve
upon
the
form
of
statement
it
is
proper
that
he
should
quote
the
language
carefully
giving
the
source
whence
it
is
derived
without
doubt
when
the
genius
appears
who
will
do
for
pedagogy
what
aristotle
did
for
logic
and
euclid
for
geometry
he
will
so
polish
every
gem
he
gets
from
others
and
give
it
a
setting
so
unique
and
appropriate
that
the
world
will
recognize
the
touch
of
the
master
and
acknowledge
the
contribution
as
peculiarly
his
own
handiwork
in
painting
and
sculpture
we
look
to
the
past
for
the
greatest
works
of
art
in

the
century
now
closing
has
rivalled
if
not
surpassed
its
predecessors
in
the
science
and
art
of
education
the
greatest
achievements
belong
to
the
future
it
is
currently
reported
and
sometimes
believed
that
when
the
president
of
a
celebrated
university
was
asked
why
he
had
transferred
a
certain
professor
from
the
department
of
geology
to
that
of
pedagogy
he
replied
thought
the
fellow
would
do
less
harm
in
that
if
the
story
is
not
a
myth
he
probably
meant
less
harm
to
the
reputation
of
the
university
when
in
our
day
a
course
in
geology
or
logic
or
geometry
is
announced
one
can
foretell
the
ground
that
will
be
covered
no
such
prediction
can
be
made
with
reference
to
a
course
of
lectures
on
teaching
the
prophet
is
yet
to
come
who
will
fix
the
scope
of
the
science
of
education
and
give
it
something
like
definite
and
abiding
shape
this
volume
is
not
designed
to
supplant
systematic
treatises
on
psychology
and
logic
its
aim
is
to
throw
light
upon
one
important
phase
of
the
art
of
teaching
if
it
contributes
but
two
mites
to
the
treasury
of
information
on
the
science
and
art
of
education
the
labor
bestowed
upon
it
has
not
been
in
vain
should
any
critic
hint
that
two
mites
are
all
one
has
to
give
it
may
be
said
in
reply
that
it
is
better
to
give
something
than
to
give
nothing
at
all
and
that
according
to
holy
writ
the
smallest
contributions
are
not
to
be
despised
if
made
in
the
right
spirit
and
it
may
add
to
the
stock
of
ideas
to
be
informed
that
a
small
english
weight
called
mite
outweighs
very
many
of
the
current
criticisms
upon
modern
education
that
of
this
small
weight
it
takes
twenty
to
make
a
grain
and
that
to
a
faithful
teacher
a
tenth
of
a
grain
of
helpful
suggestion
is
worth
more
than
many
tons
of
destructive
criticism

thring
who
next
to
arnold
was
perhaps
the

england
ever
had
laid
much
stress
upon

sometimes
he
would
startle
a
dull
lad
in

an
exercise
by
asking

views

so
important
is
thinking
in
all
teaching
that
at
the
educational
congress
in
one
educator
after
another
rose
in
his
place
to
emphasize
the
maxim
the
pupils
one
of
the
most
advanced
of
the
reformers
shouted
in
almost
frantic
tones
make
even
the
very
babies
after
the
wise
men
had
returned
to
their
homes
a
chicago
periodical
raised
the
query
can
you
stop
a
pupil
from
thinking
and
the
conclusion
it
announced
was
that
neither
the
teacher
behind
the
desk
nor
the
tyrant
upon
his
throne
can
stop
a
pupil
from
thinking
evidently
if
that
which
sticks
up
between
a
shoulders
is
a
head
and
not
a
turnip
if
the
pupil
is
rational
and
not
an
imbecile
or
an
idiot
he
does
some
thinking
for
himself
and
the
maxim
the
pupils
think
requires
further
analysis
before
it
can
be
helpful
in
the
art
of
teaching
sidenote
thinking
for
self
relying
on
others
we
who
teach
are
very
apt
to
overestimate
thinking
in
our
own
line
of
work
and
to
undervalue
thinking
outside
of
the
school
there
is
perhaps
as
much
good
thought
in
a
bonnet
as
in
the
solution
of
a
quadratic
equation
a
embodies
as
much
genuine
thought
as
the
demonstration
of
a
geometrical
theorem
the
construction
of
a
locomotive
or
a
railway
bridge
displays
as
much
effective
thinking
as
of
history
or
of
the
pure
most
men
think
very
well
in
doing
their
own
kind
of
work
in
many
other
spheres
of
activity
they
must
let
other
people
think
for
them
when
the
professor
of
astronomy
discusses
a
problem
connected
with
his
science
he
thinks
for
himself
but
when
he
buys
a
piece
of
land
he
gets
a
lawyer
to
think
for
him
in
the
examination
of
the
title
and
the
preparation
of
the
deed
the
lawyer
thinks
for
himself
in
the
but
when
he
goes
home
to
dine
he
expects
his
wife
or
the
cook
to
have
done
the
thinking
for
him
in
the
preparation
of

grover
cleveland
had
the
reputation
of
thinking
for
himself
many
a
politician
found
out
that
this
reputation
was
founded
on
fact
but
when
the
is
sick
or
has
the
toothache
he
is
willing
to
let
a
physician
or
a
dentist
think
for
him
in
like
manner
a
pupil
may
think
very
well
upon
the
but
if
the
teacher
whose
very
name
indicates
the
function
of
guiding
fails
to
guide
the
pupil
aright
the
latter
may
become
a
mere
parrot
in
the
what
then
is
involved
in
making
a
pupil
think
sidenote
thinking
defined
the
difficulty
in
answering
this
question
is
increased
by
the
diversity
of
meanings
of
the
word
the
teacher
who
is
not
clear
in
his
use
of
the
term
may
employ
exercises
calculated
to
develop
one
kind
of
mental
activity
and
then
accuse
the
pupils
of
dulness
because
they
do
not
show
facility
in
some
other
intellectual
process
when
a
on
mental
science
defines
the
intellect
as
the
power
by
which
we
think
the
term
is
used
to
designate
every
form
of
intellectual
activity
the
century
dictionary
defines
thinking
as
an
exercise
of
the
cognitive
faculties
in
any
way
not
involving
outward
observation
or
the
passive
reception
of
ideas
from
other
minds
the
logician
defines
thinking
as
the
process
of
comparing
two
ideas
through
their
relation
to
a
third
many
exercises
of
the
school
are
supposed
to
cultivate
thinking
in
the
last
sense
of
the
word
when
in
reality
they
cultivate
thinking
only
in
the
widest
acceptation
of
the
term
sidenote
a
faulty
exercise
the
writer
saw
a
normal
school
principal
conduct
an
exercise
in
thinking
as
the
latter
called
it
turning
to
one
of
the
pupils
he
said
will
you
please
think
of
something
as
soon
as
the
boy
raised
his
hand
the
principal
asked
it
belong
to
the
animal
the
vegetable
or
the
mineral
kingdom
then
turning
to
the
other
members
of
the
class
he
said
of
you
can
think
of
the
vegetable
in
mind
the
names
of
at
least
forty
different
vegetables
were
given
and
spelled
and
written
upon
the
at
last
a
pupil
succeeded
in
naming
what
was
in
mind
then
there
was
a
look
of
triumph
upon
the
faces
of
the
principal
and
the
class
as
much
as
to
say
that
splendid
thinking
at
least
one
person
felt
like
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
for
very
shame
for
here
was
resurrected
from
the
dead
an
old
exercise
of
philanthropinism
which
was
buried
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
what
should
one
call
that
kind
of
mental
activity
that
is
all
it
is
the
exercise
tended
to
beget
a
habit
very
difficult
to
break
up
after
it
has
been
formed
sidenote
a
better
plan
far
better
was
an
exercise
which
the
writer
witnessed
in
a
graded
school
the
teacher
had
called
the
class
in
the
second
reader
as
soon
as
all
the
pupils
were
seated
she
said
may
read
the
first
instead
of
reading
orally
the
class
became
so
quiet
that
one
might
have
heard
a
pin
drop
after
most
of
the
hands
were
raised
she
called
upon
one
pupil
to
tell
what
the
paragraph
said
the
second
paragraph
was
read
and
the
substance
of
it
stated
in
the
own
words
an
omission
was
supplied
by
another
pupil
an
incorrect
phrase
was
modified
by
giving
the
correct
words
for
conveying
the
thought
in
the
course
of
the
lesson
it
became
necessary
to
clarify
the
ideas
of
some
this
was
accomplished
by
a
few
pertinent
questions
which
made
the
pupils
think
for
themselves
after
the
entire
lesson
had
been
read
in
this
way
she
dismissed
the
class
without
assigning
a
lesson
every
member
of
the
class
went
to
his
seat
took
out
his
slate
and
began
to
write
out
the
lesson
in
his
own
language
the
interest
and
pleasure
depicted
on
their
faces
showed
that
it
was
not
a
task
but
a
joy
to
express
thought
by
the
pencil
the
teacher
had
given
them
something
to
think
about
she
had
taught
them
to
express
their
thoughts
in
spoken
and
written
language
her
questions
had
stimulated
their
thinking
and
when
later
in
the
day
the
lesson
in
oral
reading
was
given
the
vocal
utterance
showed
that
every
pupil
understood
what
he
was
reading
there
was
no
utterance
of
vocables
but
an
expression
of
thought
based
upon
a
thorough
understanding
and
appreciation
of
what
was
read
the
silent
reading
was
an
exercise
in
and
the
language
lesson
upon
the
slate
was
an
exercise
in
active
thinking
through
written
words
and
the
oral
expression
furnished
a
test
by
which
the
teacher
could
ascertain
what
she
had
accomplished
in
getting
her
pupils
to
think
sidenote
a
suggestive
reply
the
first
thing
necessary
in
making
the
pupil
think
is
best
shown
by
relating
another
incident
the
catalogue
of
a
school
announced
that
the
teachers
were
aiming
to
get
their
pupils
to
read
latin
at
sight
and
to
think
in
more
tongues
than
one
a
captious
superintendent
wrote
to
the
principal
saying
envy
you
how
do
you
do
it
we
would
be
satisfied
if
we
could
make
pupils
think
in
the
reply
was
equally
sharp
and
suggestive
ask
how
we
make
pupils
think
i
answer
by
giving
them
something
to

a

who
was

was
compelled
by
circumstances
to
quit
his

and
to
accept
a
position
as
janitor
one
day
the
pipe
leading
from
the
sink
to
the
sewer
was
clogged
the
teacher
in
conjunction
with
a
carpenter
worked
a
long
time
to
fix
it
but
in
vain
the
janitor
was
called
who
in
a
few
moments
overcame
the
difficulty
by
the
application
of
a
principle
in
natural
philosophy
on
which
the
teacher
could
have
talked
learnedly
although
he
knew
not
how
to
apply
it
in
the
given
case
the
janitor
related
how
the
foreman
in
a
foundry
was
baffled
in
the
effort
to
bore
a
hole
through
a
piece
of
iron
until
a
workman
trained
under
a
foreign
master
suggested
the
purchase
of
two
things
at
a
by

the
hole
was
easily
bored
when
the
druggist
asked
about

use

was
to
be
made
of
these
chemicals
he
was
told
that
the
use
was
one
of
the
mysteries
of
the
trade
next
the
carpenter
fixed
the
mortise
lock
of
a
door
which
needed
attention
and
the
others
lauded
the
skill
with
which
he
handled
his
tools
and
applied
his
knowledge
before
the
three

the
son
came
with
a
word
which
he
could
not
find

his
lexicon
with
the
aid
of

the
teacher
showed
how
to

what

the

of
the

the

the

what
was
the
mental
condition
of
the

spoken
of
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
the
boy
knew
the
real
thing
long
before
he
knew
the
first

without

he
had
tasted

played
in

against

been
washed
in

against
his
own
will
for
months
before
he
learned
the
first
symbol
for
water
used
in
common
by
him
and
others
which
was
probably
the
spoken
word
up
to
that
time
he
thought
of
water
in
some
mental
picture
or
image
which
had
been
formed
upon
the
eye
and
then
upon
mind
somewhat
as
the
picture
is
formed
through
the
art
of
the
photographer
up
to
the
time
that
he
learned
the
spoken
word
for
water
this
liquid
suggested
mental
pictures
which
constituted
a
thinking
in

rather
than
in

set
by
the
standard
dictionary
on
entering

was

added

he
may
have
associated
at
first

with

very
soon
with
both

correct

were
followed
next
he
was
taught
the
the
blunder
which
the
teacher
on
the
banks
of
the
susquehanna
had
committed
consisted
not
in
teaching
how
water
is
indicated
on
a
map
but
in
not
pointing
to
the
majestic
river
near
the
and
associating
the
water
in
its
channel
with
the
representations
of
water
on

the
boy
studied
latin
or
greek
he
was
taught
new

for
water
in
the
corresponding
words
of
these
languages
if
he
studied
chemistry
he
early
learned
the
composition
of
water
and
was
thenceforth
taught
to
write
it
a
symbol
enshrining
a
new
truth
and
lifting
him

half
the
errors
in

arise
from
the
fact
that
the
teacher
does
not
constantly
bear
in
mind
the
distinction
between
the
symbol
and
the
thing
for
which
the
symbol
stands
thus
giving
rise
to
confusion

the

the

either
the

had
not
been

had
forgotten

between

and
the
ordinary

sometimes
the
confusion
exists
in
the

of
the

as

in
the
minds
of
the

then
he
expects
them
to
learn

while
he
teaches
them
another

there
is

above

of

were
not
the
inevitable
outcome
of
juggling
with
technical

apart
from
the

they
denote
a

would
have
started

would
have
lifted

than
the

he
was
in

the

should
fail
to
see
the
difference
between
an

actually
performed
and
a
description
of
the

in
a
more
incredible
still
does
it
seem
when
we
hear
of

who
see
no

a

the
noted
teacher
agassiz
made
a
difference
in
his
directions

students
to
the
former
he
would
give
specimens
with
directions
to
study
them
without
referring
to
a
book
having
taught
them
how
to
use
their
eyes
he
would
gradually
lead
them
to
the
method
of
interpreting
and
verifying
the
statements
of
an
author
and
when
the
advanced
student
was
set
to
work
at
original
investigations
he
was
told
to
study
certain
books
as
it
would
save
much
valuable
time
one
of
his
pupils
writes
shall
never
forget
a
forceful
lesson
given
me
by
the
great
agassiz
when
i
studied
with
him
in
the
museum
of
cambridge
i
worked
near
a
young
man
from
cleveland
ohio
who
has
since
achieved
distinction
as
a
teacher
of
biology
i
was
comparatively
a
beginner
however
while
he
was
well
advanced
in
his
studies
on
a
certain
day
agassiz
came
sauntering
by
and
stopped
long
enough
to
tell
me
not
to
use
the
library
so
much
but
to
confine
myself
to
observations
of
the
specimens
on
hand
and
the
writing
of
my
observations
and
comments
passing
on
a
little
farther
he
spoke
to
my
friend
and
said
when
you
go
home
this
summer
to
cleveland
i
wish
you
would
make
a
special
study
of
a
certain
kind
of
fish
found
in
the
harbor
there
it
is
not
found
plentifully
anywhere
else
in
the
world
take
a
and
go
three
hundred
yards
northeast
of
the
point
of
the
breakwater
and
you
will
find
them
in
abundance
before
going
home
get
the
only
three
books
ever
written
on
this
fish
from
the
library
here
and
read
them
it
will
save
your
time
to
read
them
before
beginning
to
study
the
fish
agassiz
was
as
anxious
to
teach
the
right
use
of
books
as
is
the
professor
of
literature
but
he
adapted
his
directions
to
the
degree
of
advancement
which
his
students
had
attained
and
did
not
neglect
the
formation
of
the
basal
concepts
and
the
habits
of
study
needful
in
the
sciences
he
taught
sidenote
botany
how
little
the
exhortations
of
our
educational
reformers
have
been
taken
to
heart
by
some
teachers
is
evident
from
the
recent
experiences
of
a
normal
school
principal
who
had
great
difficulty
in
finding
a
satisfactory
teacher
of
botany
the
students
could
invariably
answer
the
questions
of
the
state
board
of
examiners
by
filling
pages
of
manuscript
with
technical
terms
in
the
field
they
could
not
distinguish
one
plant
from
another
in
despair
the
principal
said
to
his
teacher
of
psychology
can
we
not
apply
common
sense
to
the
teaching
of

can
we
not
plant

watch
their
growth
and

the
growing
specimens
instead
of

had
prepared
together
with

accompanying

and
drawings
of
parts
which
could
not
be
described
including
colorings
in
imitation
of
the
actual
colors
of
the
flowers
gave
evidence
of
real
knowledge
and
served
to
satisfy
the
examiners
although
the
array
of
technical
terms
was
far
less
formidable
if
violations
of
the
fundamental
laws
of
teaching
occur
in
our
higher
institutions
of
learning
what
may
we
not
expect
in
the
lower
schools
where
the
teaching
is
intrusted
to
young
people
of
limited
education
nevertheless
it
is
a
notorious
fact
that
the
worst
forms
of
teaching
are
found
in
our
higher
institutions
of
learning
where
many
of
the
professors
seem
to
know
as
little
of
the
science
of
education
as
the
motorman
knows
of
the
science
of
electricity
otherwise
they
would
make
impossible
the
use
of
coaches
and
keys
by
means
of
which
the
student
taxes
the
memory
rather
than
the
understanding
and
ultimately
loses
all
power
of
independent
thought
and
investigation
such
helps
arrest
mental
development
destroy
the
power
of
original
thinking
and
do
more
harm
than
the
practice
of
feeding
the
mind
with
mere
verbal
statements
which
in

of
time
may
acquire
content
and
meaning
the
study
of
the
sciences
which
classify
minerals

other
animals
may
degenerate
into
a
mere
study
of
words
even
when
the
student
acquires
some
familiarity
with
the
specimens
to
be
classified
the
scientific
name
is
the
one
thing
about
a
flower
with
which
the
creator
has
had
nothing
to
do
and
if
the
recognition
of
the
scientific
name
is
the
chief
or
sole
aim
of
the
student
of
botany
it
is
a
genuine
case
of

somewhat
late

the
manufactured

the

of

have
more
vitality
in

for
the

in

over
several
books
of

teacher
the
difficulty
is
well
stated
in
john
discussion
of
symbolic
conceptions
he
says
any
simple
object
which
can
be
grasped
in
a
single
act
of
perception
such
as
a
knife
or
a
book
an
egg
or
an
orange
a
circle
or
a
triangle
you
can
frame
a
conception
which
almost
or
quite
exactly
the
object
the
picture
or
visual
image
in
your
mind
when
the
orange
is
present
to
the
senses
is
almost
exactly
reproduced
when
it
is
absent
the
distinction
between
the
two
lies
chiefly
in
the
relative
faintness
of
the
latter
but
as
the
objects
of
thought
increase
in
size
and
in
complexity
of
detail
the
case
soon
comes
to
be
very
different
you
can
not
frame
a
truly
representative
conception
of
the
town
in
which
you
live
however
familiar
you
may
be
with
its
streets
and
houses
its
parks
and
trees
and
the
looks
and
demeanor
of
the
townsmen
it
is
impossible
to
embrace
so
many
details
in
a
single
mental
picture
the
mind
must
range
to
and
fro
among
the
phenomena
in
order
to
represent
the
town
in
a
series
of
conceptions
but
practically
what
you
have
in
mind
when
you
speak
of
the
town
is
a
fragmentary
conception
in
which
some
portion
of
the
object
is
represented
while
you
are
well
aware
that
with
sufficient
pains
a
series
of
mental
pictures
could
be
formed
which
would
approximately
correspond
to
the
object
to
some
extent
the
conception
is
representative
but
to
a
great
degree
it
is
symbolic
with
a
further
increase
in
the
size
and
complexity
of
the
objects
of
thought
our
conceptions
gradually
lose
their
representative
character
and
at
length
become
purely
symbolic
no
one
can
form
a
mental
picture
that
answers
even
approximately
to
the
earth
even
a
homogeneous
ball
eight
thousand
miles
in
diameter
is
too
vast
an
object
to
be
conceived
otherwise
than
symbolically
and
much
more
is
this
true
of
the
ball
upon
which
we
live
with
all
its
endless
multiformity
of
detail
we
imagine
a
globe
and
clothe
it
with
a
few
terrestrial
attributes
and
in
our
minds
this
fragmentary
notion
does
duty
as
a
symbol
of
the
earth
case
becomes
still
more
striking
when
we
have
to
deal
with
conceptions
of
the
universe
of
cosmic
forces
such
as
light
and
heat
or
of
the
stupendous
secular
changes
which
modern
science
calls
us
to
contemplate
here
our
conceptions
can
not
even
pretend
to
represent
the
objects
they
are
as
purely
symbolic
as
the
algebraic
equations
whereby
the
geometer
expresses
the
shapes
of
curves
yet
so
long
as
there
are
means
of
verification
at
our
command
we
can
reason
as
safely
with
these
symbolic
conceptions
as
if
they
were
truly
representative
the
geometer
can
at
any
moment
translate
his
equation
into
an
actual
curve
and
thereby
test
the
results
of
his
reasoning
and
the
case
is
similar
with
the
undulatory
theory
of
light
the
conception
of
atomicity
and
other
vast
stretches
of
thought
which
in
recent
times
have
revolutionized
our
knowledge
of
nature
the
danger
in
the
use
of
symbolic
conceptions
is
the
danger
of
framing
illegitimate
symbols
that
answer
to
nothing
in
heaven
or
earth
as
has
happened
first
and
last
with
so
many
theories
in
science
and
in
the
word
conception
as
used
in
this
quotation
is
synonymous
with
concept
but
elsewhere
it
is
also
used
in
two
other
senses
to
signify
the
to
conceive
objects
their
relations
and
classes
and
to
name
the
activity
by
which
the
concept
is
produced
hence
the
term
concept
is
preferred
in
this
discussion
sidenote
concepts
of
distance
sidenote
large
cities
to
give
a
full
account
of
the
development
of
the
basal
concepts
in
the
different
branches
of
study
would
require
a
treatise
on
the
methods
of
teaching
these
branches
all
that
can
be
attempted
is
to
draw
attention
to
some
of
the
typical
methods
and
devices
adopted
by
eminent
teachers
in
the
development
of
the
concepts
which
fiske
calls
symbolic
conceptions
distance
is
one
of
the
concepts
at
the
basis
of
geography
and
astronomy
to
say
that
the
circumference
of
the
earth
is
thousand
miles
that
the
distance
of
the
moon
from
the
earth
is
two
hundred
and
forty
thousand
miles
and
that
the
distance
of
the
sun
is
and
millions
of
miles
may
mean
very
little
to
the
human
mind
especially
to
the
mind
of
a
child
supposing
however
that
a
boy
finds
a
mile
by
actual
measurement
and
that
he
finds
he
can
walk
four
miles
an
hour
he
can
gradually
rise
to
the
thought
of
walking
forty
miles
in
a
day
of
ten
hours
or
two
hundred
and
forty
miles
in
the
six
working
days
of
a
week
in
one
hundred
and
four
weeks
or
two
years
he
could
walk
around
the
globe
to
walk
to
the
moon
would
require
a
thousand
weeks
or
about
twenty
years
it
is
by
the
method
of
gradual
approach
that
concepts
of
great
distance
of
immense
magnitudes
of
the
infinitely
large
and
the
infinitely
small
must
be
developed
to
this
category
belong
large
cities
like
new
york
and
london
quantities
denoting
the
size
of
the
earth
and
its
distance
from
the
sun
and
the
fixed
stars
the
fraction
of
a
second
in
which
a
is
taken
or
an
electric
flash
is
photographed
such
quantities
are
apt
to
remain
as
mere
figures
or
symbols
in
the
mind
of
the
learner
unless
the
method
of
gradual
approach
is
adopted
starting
with
a
town
or
a
ward
with
which
the
pupil
is
familiar
several
may
be
joined
in
idea
until
the
concept
of
a
city
of
fifty
or
sixty
thousand
population
is
reached
it
takes
about
twenty
of
these
to
make
a
city
like
philadelphia
and
five
cities
like
philadelphia
to
make
a
city
like
london
a
lesson
on
how
london
is
fed
will
add
much
to
the
formation
of
an
adequate
idea
of
such
a
large
city
sidenote
shape
of
the
earth
an
adequate
idea
of
the
shape
of
the
earth
can
be
formed
only
by
gradual
development
the
three
kinds
of
roundness
dollar
pillar
ball
must
be
taught
then
the
various
easily
intelligible
reasons
for
believing
it
to
be
round
like
a
ball
may
follow
in
the
elementary
grade
as
the
pupil
advances
he
may
be
told
of
the
dispute
between
newton
and
the
french
the
former
affirming
it
to
be
round
like
an
orange
is
flattened
at
the
poles
latter
asserting
that
it
resembled
a
lemon
with
the
polar
axis
longer
than
the
equatorial
diameter
and
how
by
measuring
degrees
of
latitude
and
finding
that
their
length
increases
as
we
approach
the
poles
the
french
mathematicians
in
spite
of
their
wishes
to
the
contrary
proved
view
to
be
correct
the
same
lesson
might
be
taught
by
starting
with
the
rotation
of
the
earth
showing
by
experiment
the
tendency
of
revolving
bodies
to
bulge
out
at
the
equator
and
then
drawing
the
inference
that
the
degrees
of
latitude
are
shortest
where
the
curvature
is
greatest
and
that
they
are
longest
where
the
curvature
is
least
either
method
is
strictly
logical
but
the
method
which
follows
the
order
of
discovery
whenever
it
is
feasible
is
calculated
to
arouse
the
greater
interest
in
minds
of
average
capacity
the
teacher
who
is
a
master
of
his
art
will
supplement
the
historical
lesson
by
a
lesson
passing
from
cause
to
consequence
so
as
to
fix
and
clarify
the
concept
formed
by
passing
from
the
ground
of
knowledge
to
the
necessary
inference
finally
by
drawing
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
equatorial
diameters
are
not
all
of
the
same
length
he
will
build
up
in
the
mind
a
concept
of
the
real
shape
of
the
earth
shape
unlike
any
mathematical
figure
treated
of
in
the
on
geometry
the
attempt
to
give
a
complete
idea
of
the
shape
of
the
earth
in
the
first
lessons
on
geography
would
have
ended
in
confusion
of
thought
the
wise
teacher
develops
complex
concepts
gradually
and
not
more
rapidly
than
the
learner
is
able
to
advance
this
process
may
be
called
enriching
the
concept
the
successive
concepts
although
only
partial
representations
of
what
is
to
be
known
are
adequate
for
the
thinking
required
at
a
given
stage
of
development
the
number
of
complete
or
exhaustive
concepts
in
any
department
of
knowledge
is
small
indeed
sidenote
the
order
of
discovery
and
of
instruction
instructive
as
it
often
is
to
follow
the
order
of
discovery
it
must
not
be
inferred
that
this
is
invariably
the
best
order
of
instruction
what
teacher
of
astronomy
would
be
so
foolish
as
to
lead
a
student
through
the
nineteen
imaginary
paths
which
kepler
tried
before
he
discovered
that
an
elliptical
orbit
fitted
the
recorded
observations
of
tycho
brahe
much
may
be
learned
from
the
methods
pursued
by
eminent
teachers
it
will
abundantly
pay
any
teacher
of
science
to
study
lectures
on
the
chemistry
of
a
candle
series
which
for
models
of
developing
the
fundamental
concepts
of
chemistry
is
unsurpassed
the
devices
used
by
such
teachers
are
often
very
suggestive
for
instance
in
teaching
the
concept
of
the
new
geography
that
the
earth
revolves
not
like
a
body
with
a
liquid
interior
but
like
a
body
with
an
interior
as
rigid
as
glass

kelvin
suggests
a
comparison
of
the
spinning
of
a
egg
and
of

boiled

made
in
every
sidenote
ideas
of
great
distances
a
few
quotations
from
the
astronomer
young
will
show
how
concepts
of
great
distances
can
be
developed
so
as
to
be
more
than

ciphers

to
try
to

such
a
distance
supposing
that
he
could
walk
four
miles
an
hour
and
keep
it
up
for
ten
hours
every
day
it
would
take
and
years
to
make
a
single
million
of
miles
and
more
than
hundred
years
to
traverse
the
whole
if
some
celestial
railway
could
be
imagined
the
journey
to
the
sun
even
if
our
trains
ran
sixty
miles
an
hour
day
and
night
without
a
stop
would
require
over
one
hundred
and
years
to
borrow
the
curious
illustration
of
professor
mendenhall
if
we
could
imagine
an
arm
long
enough
to
enable
him
to
touch
the
sun
and
burn
himself
he
would
die
of
old
age
before
the
pain
could
reach
him
since
according
to
the
experiments
of
helmholtz
and
others
a
nervous
shock
is
communicated
only
at
the
rate
of
one
hundred
feet
per
second
or
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
miles
a
day
and
would
need
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
to
make
the
journey
sound
would
do
it
in
about
fourteen
years
if
it
could
be
transmitted
through
celestial
space
and
a
in
about
nine
if
it
were
to
move
uniformly
with
the
same
speed
as
when
it
left
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
if
the
earth
could
be
suddenly
stopped
in
her
orbit
and
allowed
to
fall
unobstructed
towards
the
sun
under
the
accelerating
influence
of
his
attraction
she
would
reach
the
centre
in
about
two
months
i
have
said
if
she
could
be
stopped
but
such
is
the
compass
of
her
orbit
that
to
make
its
circuit
in
a
year
she
has
to
move
nearly
nineteen
miles
a
second
or
more
than
fifty
times
faster
than
the
swiftest
and
in
moving
twenty
miles
her
path
deviates
from
perfect
straightness
by
less
than
of
an
professor
young
uses
a
very
suggestive
device
in
his
astronomy
for
showing
the
comparative
sizes
and
distances
of
heavenly
bodies
the
sun
by
a
globe
two
feet
in
diameter
the
earth
would
be
of
an
inch
in
size
of
a
very
small
pea
or
a
caliber
round
its
distance
from
the
sun
on
that
scale
would
be
just
two
hundred
and
twenty
feet
and
nearest
still
on
the
same
scale
be
eight
thousand
miles
away
at
the
sometimes
the
employment
of
a
new
unit
aids
in
realizing
the
idea
of
very
great
distances
the
ordinary
astronomical
unit
is
the
distance
of
the
sun
from
the
earth
it
is
not
large
enough
to
be
convenient
in
expressing
the
distances
of
fixed
stars
hence
astronomers
have
found
it
more
satisfactory
to
take
as
a
unit
the
distance
light
travels
in
a
year
which
is
about
thousand
times
the
distance
of
the
sun
from
the
earth
the
tables
of
fixed
stars
give
distances
in
terms
of
this
unit
from
upward
a
glance
at
these
figures
fills
the
mind
with
an
idea
of
the
infinite
grandeur
of
the
universe
and
with
feelings
of
awe
and
sublimity
akin
to
those
which
must
fill
the
soul
on
approaching
the
throne
of
almighty
god
sidenote
time
of
scientists
assert
that
the
infinitely
great
is
more
easily
conceived
than
the
infinitely
small

represented
by

trillions
are
more
easily
grasped
than
fractions

comprehended

a
lecture
delivered
at

charles

idea
of
how

may
be
made

a

taken
of
an

if

corpuscular
theory
of

a
chain
of

thousand
million

surely
that
number
should
produce
an
effect
we
can
readily
conceive
that
one

million
wavelets
would
produce
an
appreciable
effect
they
would
represent

of

would
seem
then
to
be

to
produce
a
photographic

idea
of
total
depravity
many
teachers
of
science
spend
all
their
spare
time
in
reading
scientific
literature
and
in
posting
themselves
upon

achievements
in
their

it
might
be
to
them
a

delightful
occupation
if
they
traversed

bestowed
upon
the
best
way

have

and
would

of
the
most
abstruse
and
complex
ideas

be
resolved
by
analysis
into
their
elements
and
thereby
be
made
intelligible
to
people
of
ordinary
training
an
eminent
teacher
of
theology
felt
called
upon
to
impart
to
a
promiscuous
audience
an
idea
of
the
doctrine
of
total
depravity
as
taught
by
the
church
he
started
by
referring
first
to
the
popular
mistake
that
the
doctrine
teaches
the
utter
depravity
of
the
human
race
then
to
the
ancient
heresy
that
the
depravity
of
human
nature
resides
in
the
body
and
not
in
the
soul
and
finally
to
the
meaning
of
total
as

is
greater

reach

before

computed
the
ratio
of
the

to
the
diameter
to

considered
so
great
that
the

was
inscribed
upon

then
turning
to
the

let
him
examine
the

by
which
clausen

out

who
developed

his
idea
of
the

introduced
by

will
be
heightened
still
more
on
learning
that

carried
the
calculation
to
six
hundred

seven
decimal
places
result
so
nearly
accurate
that
if
it
were
correctly
used
in
calculating
the
circumference
of

the
possible
error
would
be
inappreciable
in
the
most

on
further
learning

π
to

teaching
was
in

with
the
laws
of
mental
growth
for
fear
the
pupils
would
manipulate
the
arabic
figures
without
corresponding
ideas
collections
and
equal

of

were
drawn
upon
the

to
illustrate
addition
and
subtraction
of
integers
and
fractions
the
plan
was
followed
for
years
and
carried
upward
through

finally
the

were
examined
for
admission
into
the
high
school
a

involving
the
four
fundamental
rules
in

which
could
not

or

was

only
ten

the

kind
of
problem
was
given
three
times
by
three
different
persons
and
with
practically
the
same
outcome
the
teachers
realized
that
they
had
kept
up
for
too
long
a
time
the
thinking
in
things
instead
of
drilling
the
pupils
upon
the
process
of
thinking
in
the
symbols
of
the
arabic
notation
it
is
of
course
possible
to
think
number
without
using
the
arabic
digits
the
romans
did
so
by
means
of
their
and
the
chinese
do
so
by
devices
of
their
own
the

which
were
brought
into

through

influences
are
derived
according
to
max
mueller
from
the
first
letters
of
the
sanskrit
words
for
the
first
ten
numerals
their
use
facilitated
calculation
to
such
an
extent
that
arithmetic
gradually
ceased
to
be
the
prerogative
of
slaves
and
ecclesiastics
its
operations
began
to
be
understood
by
freemen
and
by
the
nobility
if
children
are
denied
the
use
of
objects
in
their
early
lessons
in
number
they
resort
to
counting
on
their
fingers
if
they
are
not
led
from
this
thinking
on
their
fingers
to
thinking
in
figures
they
will
never
become
expert
in
arithmetic
sometimes
the
fingers
no
longer
move
but
the
mind
conceives
pictures
of
the
hand
and
the
eye
runs
along
the
fingers
of
hands
not
visible
to
the
corporeal
eye
it
is
equally
bad
if
the
pupils
never
think
number
except
by
mental
pictures
of
blocks
sticks
balls
and
the
like
when
the
pupil
sees
he
should
not
conceive
seven
heaps
of
nine
each
and
then
a
rearrangement
into
six
groups
of
ten
and
three
stray
ones
alongside
of
these

began
to

into

and
thirds
and
fourths
and

they
added

subtracted
by
subdividing
these
into

that
denoted

of

whilst
the
charm
of

still
clung
to
the
process
a

who
visited

asked
one
of

how

still
another
incident
taken
from
actual
life
will
serve
to
throw
light
upon
the
subject
under
discussion
in
the
booming
days
of
the
iron
industry
a
laborer
had
saved
and
put
out
at
interest
twelve
hundred
dollars
the
rate
was
six
per
and
no
interest
had
been
paid
for
one
year
and
four
months
unable
to
reckon
interest
with
figures
the
toiler
asked
the
principal
of
the
schools
to
tell
him
the
amount
of
interest
due
next
day
he
greeted
the
principal
by
asking

in

said
the

this
aroused
still
greater

for

that
beyond
the
ability
to

the
man
had
no
knowledge
of
arithmetic
by
agreement
they
met
on
saturday
afternoon
so
that
the
man
might
show
his
method
of
reckoning
interest
at
the
appointed
hour
the
man
laid
six
pennies
on
the
floor
to
denote
a
interest
on
one
dollar
and
then
laid
two
pennies
alongside
of
these
as
the
additional
interest
on
a
dollar
for
four
months
the
supply
of
pennies
being
exhausted
he
made
strokes
with
chalk
and
proceeded
to
do
this
twelve
hundred
times
and
then
to
count
them
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
interest
it
was
thinking
in
things
with
a
vengeance
and
yet
the
making
of
strokes
with
chalk
was
a
step
in

even

as
the

or

or
relation
of

in
the
external
world
which
corresponds
to

in

the

denote

or
involve
more

the
abstract
and
general
concepts
under
which
the

classifies

this

when

reaction
against
rote
teaching
so
much
has
been
said
and
written
against
the
teaching
of
mere
words
especially
big
words
against
recitations
of
definitions
rules
principles
and
forms
of
statement
given
in
the
or
wrought
out
by
the
teacher
that
many
people
fail
to
see
the
value
of
technical
terms
as
instruments
of
thought
a
separate
chapter
is
necessary
to
point
out
their
function
in
scientific
thinking
and
instruction
in
common
parlance
the
use
of
technical
terms
should
be
avoided
do
we
say
that
nebuchadnezzar
had
a
long
noun
or
a
long
name
noun
is
a
technical
term
name
is
the
word
in
ordinary
use
do
we
say
that
a
man
broke
his
femur
or
his
leg
the
doctors
who
set
the
limb
will
probably
use
the
technical
term
in
their
conferences
in
talking
with
the
common
people
they
use
the
common
names
unless
they
wish
to
awe
the
multitudes
by
a
show
of
learning
often
indeed
men
use
big
words
to
hide
their
ignorance
in
physiology
the
investigations
are
carried
as
far
as
possible
and
then
a
term
is
coined
to
cover
the
unknown
often
words
are
strung
together
to
cover
a
lack
of
ideas
or
to
establish
a
reputation
for
erudition
these
are
tricks
to
which
a
genuine
teacher
has
no
occasion
to
resort
it
is
his
duty
to
ascertain
the
educational
value
of
the
technical
terms
of
science
and
to
use
these
terms
for
the
purpose
of
fixing
scientific
ideas
in
the
mind
and
of
causing
the
pupil
to
think
clearly
and
exactly
sidenote
basal
concepts
at
the
basis
of
every
science
as
we
have
seen
there
are
certain
ideas
which
can
not
be
conveyed
to
other
minds
by
the
use
of
the
corresponding
technical
terms
these
basal
concepts
must
be
built
up
in
the
mind
by
skilful
teaching
sometimes
by
the
very
process
by
which
the
race
acquired
or
discovered
them
it
may
require
a
trip
to
the
field
to
the
museum
or
to
the
mine
or
an
experiment
in
the
laboratory
may
be
necessary
perhaps
a
development
lesson
is
needed
to
enable
the
pupil
to
grasp
the
idea
clearly
and
fully
it
is
very
certain
that
if
the
idea
is
hazy
and
the
subsequent
thinking
will
be
loose
obscure
and
unsatisfactory
the
glib
use
of
technical
terms
may
often
hide
from
the
teacher
the
defects
of
the
thinking
and
it
may
require
an
examination
to
reveal
the
points
wherein
the
teacher
has
failed
questions
which
require
a
pupil
to
look
at
his
knowledge
from
a
new
point
of
view
are
helpful
an
examination
abounding
in
such
questions
may
be
an
intellectual
blessing
to
both
teacher
and
pupil
the
examiner
should
of
course
avoid
puzzling
for
these
are
calculated
to
embarrass
the
pupil
and
confuse
his
thinking
sidenote
popular
lectures
a
clear
thinker
can
always
make
his
ideas
intelligible
to
those
who
have
acquired
the
basal
concepts
of
the
things
principles
and
laws
with
which
he
deals
lecturers
on
popular
science
avoid
the
abstruse
questions
of
advanced
science
and
the
technical
terms
which
do
not
convey
a
definite
meaning
to
the
average
hearer
they
select
topics
which
can
be
discussed
in
the
language
of
common
life
and
often
state
the
results
of
scientific
research
without
leading
the
audience
through
the
successive
steps
by
which
these
results
are
obtained
the
popular
lecture
requires
special
gifts
that
are
not
in
the
possession
of
every
scientist
huxley
was
one
of
the
most
gifted
men
of
the
century
yet
he
says
of
himself

huxley
have
not
been
one
of
those
fortunate
persons
who
are
able
to
regard
a
popular
lecture
as
a
mere
unworthy
of
being
ranked
among
the
serious
efforts
of
a

who
keep
their

of

have
found
that

putting
the

learned
in

the

and
the

into
language
which
without
bating
a

of
scientific
accuracy
shall
be
generally
intelligible
taxed
such
scientific
and
literary
faculty
as
i
possessed
to
the
uttermost
indeed
my
experience
has
furnished
me
with
no
better
corrective
of
the
tendency
to
scholastic
pedantry
which
besets
all
those
who
are
absorbed
in
pursuits
remote
from
the
common
ways
of
men
and
become
habituated
to
think
and
speak
in
the
technical
dialect
of
their
own
little
world
as
if
there
were
no
sidenote
exact
thinking
there
is
an
error
on
the
other
hand
into
which
practical
men
fall
when
they
object
to
the
technical
language
of
the
scientist
there
are
many
things
in
science
which
can
not
be
made
plain
to
the
mind
the
difficulty
lies
not
in
the
terminology
employed
but
in
the
lack
of
the
basal
concepts
necessary
for
the
advanced
thinking
which
must
be
employed
says
robert
galloway
when
employed
in

unlike
their
employment

common
use

a
meaning
steadily
fixed
and
precisely
determined
this
precision
in
the
meaning
of
scientific
terms
necessarily
requires
on
the
part
of
those
who
can
make
proper
use
of
them
habits
of
this
is
an
indispensable
qualification
for
attainment
in
any
science
there
is
no
dispensing
with
it
consequently
one
who
does
not
know
the
language
of
a
science
and
who
has
not
been
taught
to
think
accurately
with
respect
to
it
can
not
understand
properly
what
may
be
told
or
shown
him
about
the
facts
or
principles
of
that
sidenote
de
quincey
from
this
point
of
view
it
is
easy
to
see
the
use
which
the
teacher
should
make
of
technical
terms
circumlocutions
and
explanatory
phrases
may
be
helpful
in
developing
fundamental
ideas
but
the
corresponding
technical
terms
should
be
associated
with
the
ideas
as
soon
as
these
assume
clear
definite
shape
language
is
the
atmosphere
in
which
thinking
lives
technical
language
is
as
necessary
to
the
scientific
thought
as
the
air
we
breathe
is
to
the
physical
life
in
one
of
his
letters
to
a
young

whose
education
had
been
neglected

renders
an
important
service
to
the
science

was
not
simply
transferring
a

which
had
previously
been

useful

bringing
into

as

or
elements
which
exist
and
come
forward
hourly
in

i
urge
this
upon
your
attention
because
you
will
often
hear
such
challenges
thrown
out
as
this
or
others
involving
the
same
error
if
there
be
any
sense
in

let
us
have
it
in

transfer
into
the
unscientific

of

scientific
notions
which
it

not
fitted
to
express
the
challenger
proceeds
upon
the
common
error
of
supposing
all
ideas
fully
developed
to
exist
in
all
understandings
ergo
his
own
and
all
that
are
in
his

he
thinks
we
can
express
in
english
thus
the
challenger
in
his
own
notions
has
you
in
a
dilemma
at
any
rate
for
if
you
do
not
translate
it
then
it
confirms
his
belief
that
the
whole
is
jargon
if
you
do
as
doubtless
with
the
help
of
much
periphrasis
that
will
be
intelligible
to
a
man
who
already
understands
the
philosophy
then
where
was
the
use
of
the
terminology
but
the
way
to
deal
with
this
fellow
is
as
follows
my
good
sir
i
shall
do
what
you
ask
but
before
i
do
it
i
beg
you
will
oblige
me
by
translating
this
mathematics
into
the
language
of
chemistry
translating
this
chemistry
into
the
language
of

both
into
the

of

finally
solve
me
the
cambridge
problem
given
the

the

of

to
determine
the
longitude
of
the

this
is
the
way
to
deal
with
such
sidenote
images
sidenote
higher
forms
of

technical

are
very
helpful
in
dealing
with
that
which
can
not
be

or

when
francis

his
inquiries
into

conceive
the

table
to
recall
vividly
the
various
dishes
and
the
way
in
which
they
are
placed
upon
the
table
many
men
of
scientific
habits
of
thought
declared
that
there
is
no
such
human
faculty
on
the
other
hand
the
educational
reformer
whose
early
training
did
not
make
him
familiar
with
the
of
higher
mathematics
may
honestly
declare
that
he
can
not
conceive
an
abstract
number
and
as
a
matter
of
course
he
can
have
no
adequate
conception
of
the
value
of
the
higher
forms
of
thinking
in
symbols
harris
has
well
said
that
the
mind
can
think
ideas
which
can
not
be
pictorially
conceived
or
made
to
stand
before
the

in
in
thinking
this
class
of
ideas
technical
terms
are
indispensable
as
instruments
of
thought
sidenote
symbols
classified
sidenote
suggestive
symbols
the
value
of
technical
terms
as
instruments
of
thought
is
seen
in
a
still
clearer
light
if
we
try
to
classify
the
various
uses
of
the
signs
and
symbols
which
are
employed
as
aids
in
thinking
many
of
these
have
no
office
beyond
that
of
the
things
or
ideas
for
which
they
stand
to
this
class
belong
the
marks
which
suggest
to
the
tramp
a
cross
dog
or
a
good
meal
as
soon
as
he
has
seen
them
they
could
be
erased
the
train
of
thought
which
they
started
in
his
mind
can
go
on
without
them
of
a
similar
character
are
the
devices
by
which
the
merchant
marks
the
buying
and
the
selling
prices
of
goods
the
red
and
blue
lights
used
on
railways
and
ocean
steamers
the

employed
by
the

corps
of
an
army
and
the
steps
grips
signs
countersigns
and
passwords
employed
by
secret
societies
as
a
means
of
identification
very
many
of
the
artificial
devices
used
in
systems
of
mnemonics
have
no
higher
function
than
that
of
suggesting
what
otherwise
might
be
forgotten
sidenote
symbols
as
substitutes
very
different
are
the
signs
and
symbols
which
mathematics
employs
as
substitutes
for
the
quantities
to
be
considered
in
adding
a
column
in
the
ledger
or
in
a
statistical
table
the
mind
thinks
the
figures
without
reference
to
the
concrete
objects
which
they
denote
in
the
solution
of
a
problem
in
algebra
the
unknown
quantities
are
represented
by
symbols
like
and
the
known
quantities
by
the
first
letters
of
the
alphabet
or
by
numerical
expressions
the
relations
between
the
quantities
are
indicated
by
equations
there
is
no
thought
of
the
quantities
themselves
while
the
mind
is
engaged
in
manipulating
the
symbols
according
to
rules
of
operation
and
only
when
the
result
is
to
be
interpreted
do
the
quantities
reappear
in
the
field
of
consciousness
the
substitute
symbol
is
a
device
for
temporarily
dropping
an
idea
until
it
is
needed
for
interpretation
the
suggestive
symbol
is
a
means
of
bringing
an
idea
or
thought
into
the
domain
of
consciousness
the
latter
furnishes
or
recalls
material
for
the
mind
to
act
upon
the
former
lightens
the
burden
which
the
mind
would
otherwise
have
to
carry
the
arithmetical
solution
of
an
age
question
in
which
the
mind
constantly
carries
the
thought
of
age
and
his
age
as
compared
with
the
algebraic
solution
of
the
same
question
in
which
a
and
his
wife
as
well
as
their
ages
sink
temporarily
out
of
sight
shows
the
value
of
substitute
signs
and
symbols
in
mathematical
thinking
and
explains
why
algebraic
methods
are
so
far
superior
to
the
clumsy
and
involved
methods
of
arithmetical
analysis
sidenote
expressive
symbols
different
from
either
of
these
is
the
class
of
symbols
used
in
expressing
ideas
this
class
includes
not
only
the
words
of
written
and
spoken
language
but
also
the
natural
signs
of
gesture
language
and
the
conventional
signs
of
manual
language
taught
to
deaf
mutes
the
language
is
full
of
faded
metaphors
indicating
the
office
of
common
words
they
are
said
to
express
meaning
to
convey
thought
to
embody
ideas
to
enshrine
content
they
may
be
likened
to
through
which
one
sees
what
is
back
of
them
sometimes
the
like
spectacles
when
first
worn
attract
more
attention
from
the
person
looking
than
the
objects
seen
through
them
parallel
to
what
occurs
when
the
articulate
speech
or
its
rhetorical
adornment
attracts
more
attention
than
the
thought
expressed
but
if
that
which
is
seen
through
the
is
on
the
order
of
a
santa
claus
loaded
with
toys
and
then
no
notice
is
taken
of
the
medium
through
which
the
object
is

hence
the
very
best
which
rivets
attention
upon
the

to
teach
the
spelling
of
words
incidentally
furthermore
the
instruction
which
frequently
stops
to
draw
attention
to
the
grammar
of
the
sentences
the
spelling
of
the
words
or
their
mode
of
utterance
interferes
with
the
formation
of
logical
habits
of
thinking
and
divests
the
words
of
their
function
as
expressive
signs
when
the
word
itself
becomes
an
object
of
thought
the
mind
is
not
thinking
by
means
of
that
word
it
has
been
well
said
that
we
may
fail
to
apprehend
the
meaning
of
what
a
person
is
saying
because
the
tone
of
his
voice
arrests
our
attention
through
its
resemblance
to
that
of
some
one
else
in
whom
we
feel
an
interest
that
so
far
as
signs
thus
attract
notice
on
their
own
account
they
fail
to
fulfil
their
function
as
a
means
of
attending
to
something
other
than
themselves
for
this
very
pertinent
observation
credit
is
due
to
stout
who
lxii
page
has
very
clearly
drawn
the
distinction
between
the
three
classes
of
signs
or
symbols
used
as
helps
in
thinking
he
says
sidenote
f
stout
signs
serve
only
to
bring
something
to
mind
they
are
not
a
means
of
minding
it
when
once
recalled
an
expressive
sign
on
the
contrary
is
a
means
of
attending
to
its
signification
expressive
signs
differ
from
substitutes
in
a
manner
exactly
the
inverse
of
that
in
which
they
differ
from
suggestive
signs
a
suggestive
sign
has
fulfilled
its
purpose
and
becomes
of
no
further
avail
so
soon
as
it
has
suggested
its
meaning
a
substitute
sign
is
a
counter
which
takes
the
place
of
its
meaning
so
long
as
it
fulfils
its
representative
function
it
renders
useless
all
reference
to
that
which
it
represents
the
counters
are
manipulated
according
to
certain
rules
of
operation
until
a
certain
result
is
reached
which
is
then
interpreted
the
operator
may
be
actually
unable
to
interpret
the
intermediate
steps
algebraical
and
arithmetical
symbols
are
to
a
great
extent
used
as
mere
substitute
signs
the
same
is
true
of
the
symbols
employed
in
formal
logic
it
is
possible
to
use
signs
of
this
kind
whenever
fixed
and
definite
rules
of
operation
can
be
derived
from
the
nature
of
the
things
symbolized
so
as
to
be
applied
in
manipulating
the
signs
without
further
reference
to
their
signification
a
word
is
an
instrument
for
thinking
about
the
meaning
which
it
expresses
a
substitute
sign
is
a
means
of
not
thinking
about
the
meaning
which
it
sidenote
fixing
concepts
in
addition
to
these
three
purposes
the
technical
term
may
serve
still
another
important
end
it
helps
to
fix
the
new
concept
or
notion
after
it
has
been
developed
by
skilful
instruction
its
association
therewith
makes
it
a
suggestive
sign
whenever
occasion
requires
the
recurrence
of
the
concept
or
thought
for
which
it
stands
the
train
of
thought
is
facilitated
and
made
possible
by
the
use
of
technical
terms
as
expressive
signs
and
if
the
idea
denoted
by
it
can
be
accurately
defined
so
that
the
definition
becomes
a
triumph
of
intellect
or
if
it
can
be
quantified
so
as
to
become
a
unit
of
measure
like
the
volts
ohms
ampères
and
watts
in
applied
electricity
the
technical
term
may
even
serve
a
purpose
analogous
to
the
substitute
signs
in
sciences
like
formal
logic
and
mathematics
sidenote
proper
use
of
technical
terms
the
foregoing
analysis
indicates
the
proper
method
of
teaching
technical
terms
first
the
basal
concept
should
be
carefully
developed
and
clearly
presented
it
should
then
be
fixed
in
the
mind
by
association
with
the
corresponding
technical
term
finally
the
union
should
be
made
permanent

when
in

the

is
not
absolutely
required
circumlocutions

thought

it
seems

quite
certain
that
we
can
and
do
think
things
without
thinking
of
any
sound
or
words
language
seems
to
me
to
be
necessary
to
the
progress
of
thought
but
not
at
all
necessary
to
the
mere
act
of
thinking
it
is
a
product
of
thought
a
vehicle
for
the
communication
of
it
a
channel
for
the
conveyance
of
it
and
an
embodiment
which
is
essential
to
its
growth
and
continuity
but
it
seems
to
be
altogether
erroneous
to
represent
it
as
an
inseparable
part
of
cogitation
donkeys

because

the

of

articulation
exists
sometimes
in
wonderful
perfection
but
parrots
are
not
so
clever
as
many

have
no

vocal

not

should
every

perfectly
express

there
should
be
no
important
meaning
without
its

we
have
occasion
to
think
of
often

have

three

in

of

three
contingencies
are
possible
the
growth

may
be
more
rapid
than
the
acquisition
of

the

the
ability

them
in

the
acquisition
of

the
tendency
to
acquire
words
without
the
corresponding
ideas
is
in
at
least
one
direction
a
source
of
gain
rather
than
loss
the
pert
phrases
profane
words
and
other
objectionable
language
which
the
child
accidentally
hears
from
the
lips
of
older
persons
and
at
times
uses
to
the
unspeakable
annoyance
of
parents
and
teachers
would
be
an
occasion
for
far
more
serious
alarm
if
the
meaning
were
fully
understood
were
it
a
law
of
our
mental
life
that
the
hearing
and
learning
of
a
profane
or
obscene
word
necessarily
carried
with
it
a
clear
grasp
of
the
meaning
the
resulting
harm
to
the
inner
life
of
the
soul
would
be
immeasurably
greater
and
the
stain
upon
the
character
would
be
vastly
more
difficult
to
remove
the
objectionable

may
mirror
the
habits
of
thought
and
speech
into
which
those
in
charge
of
the
child
have
fallen
awaken
in
them
a
new
sense
of
their
responsibility
and
cause
them
to
be
more
careful
of
what
they

it
may
prove
an
index

the
kind

the

has
not
learned
to
think
the
thought
expressed
a
simple
warning
against
the
use
of
such
ugly
words
generally
suffices
to
eradicate
them
from
the
vocabulary
and
in
such
instances
it
is
a
blessing
in
disguise
that
the
learning
of
the
words
was
not
accompanied
by
the
acquisition
of
their
meaning

loss
to

intellectual

simply
imitates

an
instance
of

waste

the

sometimes
stops
in

without

exclaims

there
is
probably
a

of
truth
in
what

claims
if
the
pupil
had
mastered
the

he
would
not
only
have
a
clear
idea

but
he
would
also
have
acquired
from
the

or
from

the
words
to
express

idea
nevertheless
if
there
is
reason
for
thinking
that
the
pupil
has
devoted
reasonable
time
to
the

his
linguistic
powers
should
be

the
value
of

of

as
a
means
of
imparting
power
to
every

that

is
easily
seen

generally
acknowledged

the
literature
of
knowledge
serves
the
double
purpose
of
furnishing
us
material
for
thought
and
of
acting
as
a
stimulus
to
thought
on
this
point
we
have
the
testimony
of
the
wisest
who
have
ventured
to
give
advice
upon
the
use
of
books
lowell
says
is
certainly
true
that
the
material
of
thought
reacts
upon
the

itself
shakespeare
himself
would
have
been

had
he
been
padlocked
in
a
thinly
shaven
vocabulary
and

had
he
worked
in

only
a
more
inspired
the
advice
which
lowell
gives
concerning
a
course
of
reading
and
the
ends
of
scholarship
to
be
kept
in
mind
by
those
who
read
with
a
purpose
is
too
valuable
to
be
omitted
in
this
connection
sidenote
his
advice
is
sometimes
asked
by
young
people
to
recommend
a
course
of
reading
my
advice
would
be
that
they
should
confine
themselves
to
the
supreme
books
in
whatever
literature
or
still
better
to
choose
some
one
great
author
and
make
themselves
thoroughly
familiar
with
him
for
as
all
roads
lead
to
rome
so
do
they
likewise
lead
away
from
it
and
you
will
find
that
in
order
to
understand
perfectly
and
to
weigh
exactly
any
vital
piece
of
literature
you
will
be
gradually
and
pleasantly
persuaded
to
excursions
and
explorations
of
which
you
little
dreamed
when
you
began
and
will
find
yourselves
scholars
before
you
are
aware
for
remember
there
is
nothing
less
profitable
than
scholarship
for
the
mere
sake
of
scholarship
nor
anything
more
wearisome
in
the
attainment
but
the
moment
you
have
a
definite
aim
attention
is
quickened
the
mother
of
memory
and
all
that
you
acquire
groups
and
arranges
itself
in
an
order
that
is
lucid
because
everywhere
and
always
it
is
in
intelligent
relation
to
a
central
object
of
constant
and
growing
interest
this
method
also
forces
upon
us
the
necessity
of
thinking
which
is
after
all
the
highest
result
of
all
education
for
what
we
want
is
not
learning
but
knowledge
that
is
the
power
to
make
learning
answer
its
true
end
as
a
quickener
of
intelligence
and
a
widener
of
our
intellectual
sympathies
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
every
one
is
fitted
by
nature
or
inclination
for
a
definite
course
of
study
or
indeed
for
serious
study
in
any
sense
i
am
quite
willing
that

should

called
it

their
content
it
is
perhaps
the
only
way
in
which
time
may
be
profitably
wasted

desultory
reading
will
not
make
a
man
as
bacon
understood
it
of
one
who
has
not
memory
his
power
of
assimilation
and
above

his
comprehensive
view
of
the

of

of

in

the
relation
of
causes
and
effects
is
studied
by
adding
or
excluding
one
factor
after
another
take
the
discovery
which
made
daguerre
famous
up
to
his

men
had
tried
in

to
fix
the

of

formed
in

no
alchemist
ever
went
to

at
a
more
unpromising
task

the

deeper
hold

of
utter

of
all
kinds

in
loneliness
and
secrecy
suspected
of

even
by
his

he
kept
on

an
accident
gave
him
a
clue
to
discovery
the
plates
with
which
he
experimented
were
stowed
away
in
a
rubbish
closet
one
day
he
found
to
his
surprise
upon
one
of
these
plates
the
very
image
which
had
fallen
upon
it
in
the
camera
something
in
the
closet
must
have
produced
the

he
removed
one
thing
after
another
getting
the
same
effect
until
nothing
remained
except
some
mercury
which
had
been
spilled
upon
the
closet
floor
this
was
inferred
to
be
the
agent
which
developed
the

thus
was
laid

james

has
recently
put
in
a
plea
for
the

which
by

of
the
abuses
to
which
it
was
formerly
subjected
has
fallen
into
such
disuse

verbal

thus
a

teachers
find
that
a
very
ready

is
a
bad
educator
it
stunts
the

a

for
what
reason
i
know
not
unless
it
be
that
the
mind
to
which
it
belongs
is
prevented
by
the
very
excellence
of
its
power
of
apprehending
and
recalling
separate
facts
from
rising
to
that
discernment
of
their
relations
which
is
involved
in
reasoning
and
judgment
and
so
stays
in
a
function
which
should
be
the

it
applies

to

certainly
one
runs
the
risk
by

of
a
child
with
details
of
arresting
the
development
of

powers
of

we
prevent
that
further
development
of
it
which
consists
in
rising
from

conceptions
to
the
conception

is
another
warning
from
the
pen
of
archbishop
whately
people
have
been
intellectually
damaged
by
having
what
is
called
a
good
memory
an
unskilful
teacher
is
content
to
put
before
children
all
they
ought
to
learn
and
to
take
care
that
they
remember
it
and
so
though
the
memory
is
retentive
the
mind
is
left
in
a
passive
state
and
men
wonder
that
he
who
was
so
quick
at
learning
and
remembering
should
not
be
an
able
man
which
is
as
reasonable
as
to
wonder
that
a
cistern
if
filled
should
not
be
a
perpetual
fountain
many
men
are
saved
by
their
deficiency
of
memory
from
being
spoiled
by
an
education
for
those
who
have
no
extraordinary
memory
are
driven
to
supply
its
place
by
thinking
if
they
do
not
remember
a
mathematical
demonstration
they
are
driven
to
devise
one
if
they
do
not
remember
what
aristotle
or
bacon
said
they
are
driven
to
consider
what
they
are
likely
to
have
said
or
ought
to
have
in
his
letter
to
a
student
who
lamented
his
defective
memory
hamerton
says
that
so
far
from
writing
as
might
be
expected
a
letter
of
condolence
on
a
miserable
memory
he
felt
disposed
to
write
a
letter
of
congratulation
is
possible
that
you
may
be
blessed
with
a
selecting
memory
which
is
not
only
useful
for
what
it
retains
but
also
for
what
it
rejects
in
the
immense
mass
of
facts
which
come
before
you
in
literature
and
in
life
it
is
well
that
you
should
suffer
as
little
bewilderment
as
possible
the
nature
of
your
memory
saves
you
from
this
by
unconsciously
selecting
what
has
interested
you
and
letting
the
rest
go
sidenote
analytical
memory
in
the
last
quotation
we
get
a
hint
of
the
form
of
memory
which
latham
styles
the
analytical
analytical
memory
is
exercised
when
the
mind
furnishes
a
view
of
its
own
and
thereby
holds
together
a
set
of
impressions
selected
out
of
a
mass
thus
a
barrister
strings
together
the
material
facts
of
his
case
and
a
lecturer
those
of
his
science
by
their
bearing
on
what
he
wants
to
many
thinkers
sift
everything
they
read
hear
and
see
that
which
they
do
not
need
is
rejected
and
forgotten
that
which
has
a
bearing
upon
their
investigations
is
selected
retained
and
utilized
as
an
aid
in
thinking
a
form
of
retention
called
the
index
memory
is
very
helpful
the
lawyer
should
know
where
to
find
such
law
as
he
does
not
carry
in
his
head
having
found
the
required
statute
or
judicial
interpretation
he
applies
it
to
the
case
in
hand
no
sooner
is
a
case
finally
decided
or
settled
than
he
drops
its
details
from
his
mind
and
directs
his
intellectual
strength
to
the
interests
of
the
next
client
in
this
ability
to
sift
select
and
reject
as
the
occasion
demands
lies
the
secret
of
the
success
of
many
a
public
lecturer
of
many
a
magazine
writer
the
men
in
the
pulpit
or
upon
the
platform
who
lack
this
gift
soon
wear
out
the
public
speedily
detects
when
they
have
nothing
more
to
give
the
preparation
of
debates
speeches
essays
and
theses
trains
these
forms
of
memory
after
the
analytical
habit
has
been
formed
the
student
unconsciously
yet
constantly
gathers
classifies
and
stores
materials
for
thought
the
public
are
frequently
surprised
by
the
array
of
striking
facts
interesting
data
apt
illustrations
and
pleasing
anecdotes
with
which
he
enlivens
every
topic
of
discussion
and
elucidates
every
subject
of
investigation
sidenote
assimilative
memory
higher
than
the
analytical
is
the
assimilative
form
of
memory
which
matter
into
the
system
so
that
the
knowledge
assimilated
becomes
a
part
of
the
own
self
like
that
of
his
name
or
of
a
familiar
the
assimilation
of
knowledge
has
a
parallel
in
the
assimilation
of
food
the
phrase
that
knowledge
is
the
food
of
the
mind
has
almost
become
classical
in
treatises
on
education
the
figure
of
speech
throws
light
upon
the
relative
functions
of
memory
and
thinking
in
the
acquisition
and
elaboration
of
knowledge
before
the
food
is
set
before
the
child
it
should
be
cooked
and
put
into
the
most
palatable
form
parallel
to
the
preparation
of
the
lesson
by
the
teacher
so
that
he
may
put
it
before
the
learner
in
its
most
attractive
form
before
the
food
is
swallowed
it
should
be
masticated
broken
into
parts
parallel
to
the
act
of
analysis
by
which
the
chunks
of
knowledge
are
resolved
into
their
elements
and
each
set
before
the
mind
in
the
simplest
form
in
the
form
in
which
it
can
be
grasped
most
easily
sidenote
transformation
of
knowledge
if
the
food
remains
in
the
stomach
unchanged
it
produces
dyspepsia
and
a
long
train
of
bodily
ills
if
the
knowledge
which
the
mind
appropriates
is
retained
unchanged
it
produces
mental
dyspepsia
and
there
is
no
real
assimilation
from
this
point
of
view
we
can
easily
see
why
montaigne
said
that
to
know
by
heart
is
not
to
know
at
all
just
as
the
food
which
is
taken
into
the
body
must
be
transformed
into
chyme
and
chyle
and
blood
before
it
can
be
assimilated
so
the
knowledge
which
is
taken
up
by
the
mind
must
be
transformed
if
it
is
to
be
assimilated
the
best
illustration
of
the
transformation
of
knowledge
is
that
given
by
an
anecdote
of
gough
which
has
now
become
classic
in
a
pullman
car
a
crying
child
was
disturbing
the
slumbers
of
every
passenger
at
last
a
gruff
miner
whose
patience
was
exhausted
stuck
his
head
out
of
his
berth
and
exclaimed
should
like
to
know
where
that
mother
is
the
baggage
car
in
a
coffin
was
the
reply
of
the
person
in
charge
of
the
child
the
knowledge
imparted
by
that
phrase
was
immediately
transformed
into
new
thought
and
sentiment
and
purpose
there
was
not
another
word
of
complaint
throughout
the
entire
journey
every
passenger
was
thinking
of
the
unfortunate
child
in
the
light
of
an
orphan
their
hearts
were
stirred
with
feelings
of
sympathy
which
in
the
case
of
the
old
miner
issued
into
will
and
purpose
for
he
got
up
began
to
carry
the
little
one
and
did
his
best
to
make
it
feel
contented
in
the
new
surroundings
if
the
lessons
in
civil
government
and
history
of
the
united
states
remain
in
the
memory
a
mere
tissue
of
dates
names
and
events
the
teacher
has
failed
no
matter
how
brilliant
the
answers
in
class
or
at
the
examination
if
these
lessons
do
not
issue
in
new
thoughts
sentiments
and
purposes
if
they
do
not
enlarge
the
mental
vision
of
the
pupils
beget
in
them
the
sentiment
of
patriotism
and
cause
them
to
resolve
that
they
will
support
the
government
by
paying
a
just
share
of
its
taxes
and
by
insisting
on
a
pure
ballot
a
word
if
these
lessons
do
not
make
the
pupil
say
that
he
will
live
for
his
country
and
even
die
in
its
defence
the
teacher
has
failed
because
there
has
been
no
adequate
assimilation
of
knowledge
another
figure
of
speech
is
sometimes
used
to
describe
the
transformation
of
knowledge
a
grain
of
wheat
fall
into
the
earth
and
die
it
abideth
by
itself
alone
but
if
it
die
it
beareth
much
if
the
knowledge
which
enters
the
mind
remains
unchanged
it
abideth
by
itself
alone
but
if
it
perish
in
its
original
form
if
it
is
changed
through
the
process
of
growth
so
as
to
enter
into
new
relations
it
brings
forth
a
harvest
of
thought
and
sentiment
and
purpose
the
last
two
should
be
the
concomitants
of
the
crop
of
new
thoughts
which
spring
from
implanted
in
the
soul
that
the
ancients
understood
the
use
and
abuse
of
the
memory
is
evident
from
their
method
of
teaching
law
sidenote
teaching
the
law
the
roman
learned
by
heart
the
twelve
tables
of
the
law
his
teachers
were
not
satisfied
with
a
mere
knowledge
of
the
words
they
insisted
that
he
should
understand
the
meaning
of
the
law
and
apply
it
in
regulating
his
own
conduct
and
in
passing
judgment
upon
the
conduct
of
others
is
it
any
wonder
that
the
roman
people
became
the
exponents
of
law
and
order
throughout
the
civilized
world
and
that
roman
jurisprudence
still
exerts
a
moulding
influence
upon
the
legislation
of
the
latin
races
if
not
of
the
entire
civilized
world
there
is
still
another
nation
of
antiquity
whose
youth
were
instructed
in
the
law
with
the
most
scrupulous
care
the
ten
commandments
of
the
mosaic
law
were
committed
to
memory
in
chapter
of
deuteronomy
we
read
these
words
which
i
command
thee
this
day

be
in
thine
heart
and
thou
shalt
teach
them
diligently
unto
thy
children
and
shalt
talk
of
them
when
thou
sittest
in
thine
house
and
when
thou
walkest
by
the
way
and
when
thou
liest
down
and
when
thou
risest
up
and
thou
shalt
bind
them
for
a
sign
upon
thine
hand
and
they
shall
be
as
frontlets
between

the
universal
conviction
of
the
jewish
people
after

the

never

contains
a

and
an
error

deserving

consideration

may
signify
that
by

the
soul
is
to
be
emancipated
from
the
tyranny
of

him

a

his

throw

these
investigations
were
published
in

began
to
inquire
among

to
their

to
call
up

engaged
in

were
inclined
to
consider
him
fanciful
and
fantastic
in
supposing
that
the

really
expressed
what
he
thought
everybody
supposed
them
to

says
they
had
no

spoke
to
persons

he
got
very
different
replies
among
other
curious
things

he
discovered
he
found
that
the
power
of
thinking
in

may
be
partly
inherited
partly
developed
by
practice
and
that
it
may
be
impaired

by
the

of
hard

peculiar
to
men
engaged
in

scientific
men
as
a
class
have
feeble
powers
of

he
reached
the
conclusion
that
perception
of
sharp
mental

is
antagonistic
to
the
acquirement
of
highly
generalized
and
abstract
thought
especially
when
the
steps

further

keep
the

in
the
concrete
when
the

demands
more
advanced
and
very
different
methods
of

in
the

direction

may
be
tied
to
words

the
thinking
which

demand
points
in

can
not
forbear
quoting
his
language
in
so
far
as
it
bears
upon
the

training
in
distinction
from

as
to
the
utility
of

the

sidenote
geography
the
imagination
is
very
active
in
children
watch
their
plays
if
you
would
see
how
they
convert
a
stick
into
a
horse
the
into
a
home
and
mimic
the
drama
of
life
in
their
games
and
contests
their
life
is
largely
and
thinking
in
images
this
tendency
to
think
in
images
can
be
utilized
in
the
lessons
in
arithmetic
geometry
geography
and
history
without
the
combination
of
images
into
new
forms
and
products
the
pupil
can
not
think
the
thoughts
peculiar
to
these
branches
for
instance
the
lesson
in
geography
starts
with
what
the
child
has
seen
or
can
see
at
home
and
proceeds
to
that
which
is
away
from
home
using
pictures
drawings
and
vivid
descriptions
to
aid
the
imagination
in
picturing
scenery
cities
countries
and
forms
of
life
in
other
parts
of
the
globe
it
may
be
a
question
what
the
mind
should
think
in
connection
with
the
symbols
and
truths
of
that
science
the
form
of
a
continent
is
without
doubt
best
conceived
as
given
on
a
map
for
many
practical
purposes
cities
may
be
thought
as
mere
and
in
a
journey
many
a
river
is
for
mature
minds
a
winding
black
line
on
colored
surfaces
called
maps
nevertheless
if
geography
means
for
a
pupil
no
more
than
this
it
will
be
dry
and
uninteresting
indeed
out
of
the
images
of
things
observed
the
mind
should
be
led
to
construct
images
of
what
it
has
not
seen
these
images
are
never
an
adequate
picture
of
the
foreign
city
or
country
even
after
they
have
been
supplemented
or
modified
by
visits
to
museums

and
zoological
gardens
by

to
the

the
thoughts
of
a
country
that
one
has
journeyed
through
or
lived
in
for
a
time
consist
partly
of
images
and
partly
of
symbolic
representations
since
thinking
in
images
is
easier
for
beginners
than
thinking
in
symbols
the
instruction
in
geography
should
begin
with
at
home
with
the
things
on
the
with
the
garments
worn
and
the
means
of
transportation
used
and
proceed
from
these
to
the
life
the
home
the
dress
and
the
sports
of
children
living
in
other
lands
and
other
climes
the
lessons
in
geography
make
constant
appeals
to
the
imagination
and
call
for
thinking
in
images

in

with

in

weaves
them
into
a
fabric
in
which
their

and
significance
become
apparent
so
far
as
the
trend
of

is

it
would
have

the
teacher
to
keep
himself
and
his
pupils
wide
awake
during
the
hours
of
study
and
recitation
he
should
not
worry
them
by
excessive
tasks
or
unreasonable

of
sleep
are

when
he
undertook
to

this

of
consciousness
has
been
likened
to
a
stream
and
has
given
rise
to
the
expression
stream
of
the
metaphor
can
be
pressed
very
far
without
conveying
untruths
a
stream
does
not
always
flow
with
the
same
velocity
it
is
at
times
deep
at
other
times
shallow
now
moving
forward
like
a
swollen
torrent
now
flowing
placidly
with
scarcely
a
wave
or
a
ripple
perceptible
on
its
surface
here
its
smooth
course
is
disturbed
by
wind
and
storm
and
rain
there
its
even
flow
is
influenced
by
rocks
and
irregularities
in
the
bed
of
the
stream
again
and
again
its
current
is
modified
by
affluents
which
empty
their
waters
into
the
main

perhaps
changing
the
appearance
from
clear
to
cloudy
or
muddy
or
it
may
be
exerting
the
opposite
effect
to
all
these
peculiarities
in

there

from

furnished
many
a
figure
of
speech
for
our
poetic
literature
the
change
from
the
active
upper
waters
to
the
sedate
lower
current
may
typify
the
change
in
the
stream
of
thought
as
we
pass
from
youth
to
age
while
the
volume
of
the
stream
is
small
and
the
channel
lacks
depth
it
is
easy
to
change
the
direction
of
the
current
as
sometimes
happens
when
a
straight
channel
is
dug
to
take
the
place
of
its
windings
in
early
life
the
stream
of
thought
is
apt
to
wander
in
meandering
courses
the
teacher
may
very
frequently
find
it
necessary
to
keep
the
mind
from
wandering
to
direct
the
stream
of
thought
towards
the
destined
goal
and
to
make
it
groove
for

in
harmony
with
logical
habits
in
teaching
pupils

quite
as
essential

as
it
is
to
furnish
either
or
in
one

the

stream
of

fails
utterly
to
express
the
truth
the
constituents
of
thought
are
not
related
to
each

like

of

have
a
connection
with

that
precede
and
those
that
follow
an
inner
nexus
binds
the
successive
portions
of

hence
other
figures
of

have
been
employed
to
denote
the
connection
between
the
successive
elements
of
a
logical

as
the

of

the

of

the

it
will
be
readily
admitted
that
often
our

is
so
loose
and
disjointed
that
its

resemble
the

more
than
the

whereas
our

in

in
which

is
derived
not
from

but
from

may
perform
the
triple
function
of

supplying
the
fuel
for
the
process
regulating
the
speed
and
directing
it
along
the
lines
of
track
which
lead
to
the
desired
goal
it
is
as
natural
for
a
pupil
to
think
as
it
is
for
a
stream
to
flow
towards
the
ocean
the
stream
may
run
shallow
if
no
supply
of
water
is
received
from
the
outside
it
is
the
mission
of
the
teacher
to
keep
up
the
supply
to
remove
as
far
as
possible
the
obstructions
which
are
likely
to
throw
the
current
of
thought
into
unexpected
channels
it
is
a
peculiarity
of
this
current
of
thinking
that
it
is
cognitive
or
possesses
the
function
of
knowing
human
thought
resembles
the
stream
in
seemingly
taking
up
and
carrying
what
was
not
a
part
of
itself
just
as
the
stream
of
water
carries
minerals
in
solution
as
well
as
silt
sand
pebbles
and
even
heavier
objects
so
the
stream
of
thought
appears
to
lay
hold
of
objects
and
to
carry
them
as
part
of
itself
here
however
the
strings
of
the
analogy
break
the
stream
of
thought
is
in
the
mind
the
objects
with
which
it
deals
are
outside
of
the
mind
mental
pictures
of
these
objects
float
in
the
stream
of
thought
as
objects
on
the
bank
of
a
river
are
mirrored
in
its
waters
yet
the
parallel
is
not
complete
because
the
mind
may
turn
the
eye
upon
itself
and
make
what
is
thus
seen
the
object
of
thought
this
turning
upon
itself
may
be
likened
to
eddies
in
the
stream
but
even
when
the
mind
thus
turns
back
upon
itself
and
views
its
own
states
and
activities
these
are
regarded
as
objective
as
related
to
the
thinking
process
very
much
like
the
objects
of
knowledge
in
the
external
world
another
important
phase
of
thinking
finds
no
likeness
in
any
of
the
figures
of
speech
above
referred
to
the
mind
meets
certain
objects
of
thought
on
which
it
seems
to
tarry
or
fasten
itself
this
has
led
some
writers
to
deny
that
the
stream
of
thought
is
a
continuous
current
this
view
causes
undue
stress
to
be
laid
upon
the
material
of
thought
and
leads
the
teacher
to
undervalue
his
function
as
directing
guide
in
teaching
pupils
to
think
even
professor
bain
claims
that
sidenote
view
stream
of
thought
is
not
a
continuous
current
but
a
series
of
distinct
ideas
more
or
less
rapid
in
their
succession
the
rapidity
being
measurable
by
the
number
that
pass
through
the
mind
in
a
given
time
mental
excitement
is
constantly
judged
of
by
this
test
and
if
we
choose
to
count
and
time
the
thoughts
as
they
succeed
one
another
we
could
give
so
much
more
precision
to
the
sidenote
transitions
sidenote
two
phases
these
transitions
should
not
be
confounded
with
the
relations
between
objects
of
thought
or
between
objects
in
the
external
world
the
relations
may
be
part
of
the
thought
of
that
which
is
perceived
or
known
or
they
may
be
made
distinct
ideas
or
thoughts
the
important
phase
under
consideration
is
the
passage
of
the
mind
from
one
idea
or
thought
to
another
such
transitions
are
quite
as
important
and
quite
as
much
a
part
of
the
current
of
thought
as
the
premises
and
conclusions
on
which
the
mind
seems
to
rest
these
two
phases
of
the
may
be
likened
to
the
perching
and
the
flight
of
a
bird
this
figure
of
speech
is
used
by
professor
james
among
whose
services
to
the
profession
of
teaching
it
is
not
the
least
that
he
has
called
attention
to
the
importance
of
these
transitions
in
the
stream
of
consciousness
his
account
is
so
lucid
and
satisfactory
that
one
can
not
forbear
to
quote
his
words
at
some
length
referring
to
the
stream
of
thought
he
says
sidenote
view
of
professor
james
a
life
it
seems
to
be
made
up
of
an
alternation
of
flights
and
perchings
the
rhythm
of
language
expresses
this
where
every
thought
is
expressed
in
a
sentence
and
every
sentence
closed
by
a
period
the
are
usually
occupied
by
sensorial
imaginations
of
some
sort
whose
peculiarity
is
that
they
can
be
held
before
the
mind
for
an
indefinite
time
and
contemplated
without
changing
the
places
of
flight
are
filled
with
thoughts
of
relations
static
or
dynamic
that
for
the
most
part
obtain
between
the
matters
contemplated
in
the
periods
of
comparative
rest
us
call
the
the
parts
and
the
places
of
flight
the
parts
of
the
stream
of
thought
it
then
appears
that
the
main
need
of
our
thinking
is
at
all
times
the
attainment
of
some
other
substantive
part
than
the
one
from
which
we
have
just
been
dislodged
and
we
may
say
that
the
main
use
of
the
transitive
parts
is
to
lead
us
from
one
substantive
conclusion
to
another
now
it
is
very
difficult
introspectively
to
see
the
transitive
parts
for
what
they
really
are
if
they
are
but
flights
to
a
conclusion
stopping
them
to
look
at
them
before
a
conclusion
is
reached
is
really
annihilating
them
whilst
if
we
wait
until
the
conclusion
be
reached
it
so
exceeds
them
in
vigor
and
stability
that
it
quite
eclipses
and
swallows
them
up
in
its
glare
let
any
one
try
to
cut
a
thought
in
the
middle
and
get
a
look
at
its
section
and
he
will
see
how
difficult
the
introspective
observation
of
the
transitive
tract
is
the
rush
of
the
thought
is
so
headlong
that
it
almost
always
brings
us
up
at
the
conclusion
before
we
can
arrest
it
or
if
our
purpose
is
nimble
enough
and
we
do
arrest
it
it
ceases
forthwith
to
be
itself
as
a
crystal
caught
in
the
warm
hand
is
no
longer
a
crystal
but
a
drop
so
instead
of
catching
the
feeling
of
relation
moving
to
its
term
we
find
we
have
caught
some
substantive
thing
usually
the
last
word
we
were
pronouncing
statistically
taken
and
with
its
function
tendency
and
particular
meaning
in
the
sentence
quite
evaporated
the
attempt
at
introspective
analysis
in
these
cases
is
in
fact
like
seizing
a
spinning
top
to
catch
its
motion
or
trying
to
turn
up
the
gas
quickly
enough
to
see
the
darkness
and
the
challenge
to
these
psychoses
which
is
sure
to
be
thrown
by
doubting
psychologists
at
any
one
who
contends
for
their
existence
is
as
unfair
as
treatment
of
the
advocates
of
motion
when
asking
them
to
point
out
in
what
place
an
arrow
when
it
moves

argues
the
falsity
of
their

up

the

away

making
these

in

from

moulded
by

masters
logic
has
very
little
to
say
about
these
transitions
for
which
one
language
sometimes
supplies
words
and
expressions
altogether
wanting
in
another
frequently
we
grow
conscious
of
them
through
the
feeling
of
a
gap
to
be
filled
or
of
a
chasm
to
be
leaped
over
or
of
an
obstacle
to
be
cleared
away
or
of
something
that
obstructs
our
thinking
and
hinders
it
from
reaching
the
goal
here
again
one
can
not
refrain
from
quoting
professor
james
although
his
words
do
not
indicate
that
he
fully
realizes
the
value
for
elementary
instruction
of
what
he
has
written
here
are
his
words
truth
is
that
large
tracts
of
human
speech
are
nothing
but
of
in
thought
of
which
direction
we
nevertheless
have
an
acutely
discriminative
sense
though
no
definite
sensorial
image
plays
any
part
in
it
whatsoever
sensorial
images
are
stable
psychic
facts
we
can
hold
them
still
and
look
at
them
as
long
as
we
like
these
bare
images
of
logical
movements
on
the
contrary
are
psychic
transitions
always
on
the
wing
so
to
speak
and
not
to
be
glimpsed
except
in
flight
their
function
is
to
lead
from
one
set
of
images
to
another
as
they
pass
we
feel
both
the
waxing
and
the
waning
images
in
a
way
quite
different
from
the
way
of
their
full
presence
if
we
try
to
hold
fast
the
feeling
of
direction
the
full
presence
comes
and
the
feeling
of
direction
is
lost
the
blank
verbal
scheme
of
logical
movement
gives
us
the
fleeting
sense
of
the
movement
as
we
read
it
quite
as
well
as
does
a
rational
sentence
awakening
definite
imaginations
by
its
sidenote
directing
the
youthful
mind
right
here
the
teacher
who
is
an
artist
finds
the
opportunity
for
the
display
of
his
highest
skill
it
is
his
privilege
to
direct
the
flights
and
the
perchings
of
the
youthful
mind
he
can
shape
the
thoughts
and
their
sequence
he
can
cause
the
intellect
to
move
from
the
reason
to
its
consequence
or
in
the
reverse
direction
if
that
be
more
natural
or
more
appropriate
he
can
guide
the
thought
from
cause
to
effect
from
the
whole
to
the
parts
from
the
general
to
the
particular
from
the
end
to
the
means
from
the
design
to
its
execution
or
a
movement
the
other
way
is
possible
in
each
of
these
categories
while
thus
choosing
the
direction
which
thought
shall
take
he
can
select
the
objects
upon
which
it
shall
tarry
this
directing
influence
he
will
often
exert
when
he
is
not
aware
of
it
his
own
habits
of
mind
will
be
reflected
in
the
mental
life
of
his
pupils
there
was
profound
philosophy
in
the
reply
of
a
gifted
author
who
when
asked
by
his
daughter
what
she
should
study
said

more
concerned
about
the
teachers
under
whom
you
study

about
the

depend
far
more
upon
the

than
upon
the
upon
the
quality

instruction
than
upon
its
general
content
there
is
of
course
a
difference
in
the
culture
value
of
different
branches
of
study
but
a
study
as
valuable
as
geometry
may
be
pursued
in
a
loose
way
whilst
branches
of
much
inferior
value
for
developing
power
to
think
may
be
taught
and
studied
by
the
methods
of
rigid
and
exact
thought
sidenote
the
sidenote
forms
of
speech
in
shaping
the
activity
of

the
makes
the
mind
tarry
long
enough
for
clear
apprehension
sometimes
for
thorough
comprehension
upon
the
ideas
judgments
and
conclusions
which
are
the
framework
of
a
system
of
thought
but
he
does
not
neglect
the
transitions
from
one
to
the
other
as
if
these
were
of
little
account
or
necessarily
took
care
of
themselves
the
transitions

are
aided
by
set
phrases

soon
as
these
are
mastered
there
develops

the

was
lecturing
upon

in

dark
ages
to
show
how
the
energies
of
the
common
people
were
exhausted
in
the
struggle
for

the
resolution
of
a
synod
in

was
cited

resolution
enjoined
upon
the

of

the
peasants
were
at

provided
with

made
of
acorns
a
few
minutes
later
a
reference
was
made
to
the
autobiography
of
thomas

in
which
certain
things
are
described
as

experience
is
suggested

huxley
relates
an
amusing
story
of
an
orator
who
was
endowed
with
a
voice
of
rare
flexibility
and
power
and
with
a
fine
flow
of
words
and
who
was
called
upon
to
speak
without
much
preparation
the
applause
was
terrific
when
huxley
asked
a
neighbor
who
was
especially
enthusiastic
what
the
orator
had
said
the
latter
could
not
tell
nothing
was
lacking
in

sense
and
occasionally
grammar
the

the

that

are
due

has

text
was
hardly
announced
before
every
one
in
the
audience
including
the
writer
forgot
all
about
spurgeon
and
thought
only
of
his
message
to
the
thousands
before
him
the
secret
of
his
oratory
lay
in
his
ability
to
make
the
audience
forget
everything
except
the
gospel
he
was
preaching
if
people
after
hearing
a
speaker
talk
of
his
fine
delivery
his
flowery
language
and
beautiful
figures
of
speech
or
his
peculiarities
of
pronunciation
and
other
eccentricities
it
is
proof
positive
that
he
has
failed
instead
of
holding
the
attention
to
what
he
was
saying
the
audience
was
thinking
of
his
manner

delivery
a
book
has
the
advantage
of
keeping
the
personal
characteristics
from
interfering
with
the
stream

it
has
the
disadvantage

losing

the

is
still
more
striking
i
read
the
phrase
ship
which
carried
nelson
was
appropriately
named
the
victory
unless
the
ship
itself
is
the
prominent
interest
i
have
probably
no
image
at
all
or
at
least
only
a
faint
and
fleeting
shadow
of
some
vague
outline
i
do
not
picture
a
i
do
not
see
the
hull
masts
cordage
and
cannon
though
these
with
the
fluttering
flags
and
pennons
may
successfully
emerge
if
i
dwell
on
the
ship
i
perhaps
do
not
see
nelson
or
at
any
rate
do
not
see
his
pale
face
one
eye
and
one
arm
but
only
some
faint
suggestion
of
a
human
form
the
purpose
of
the
phrase
was
not
to
raise
images
but
to
communicate
a
fact
respecting
the
name
of
the
ship
and
my
intelligence
has
been
occupied
with
this
purpose
i
must
it
is
true
have
understood
each
word
or
at
any
rate
each
clause
of
the
sentence
but
for
this
understanding
it
is
not
necessary
that
i
should
translate
nor
even
that
i
should
be
capable
of
translating
each
word
into
an
image
or
cluster
of
images
it
is
enough
if
i
apprehend
a
series
of
logical
relations
we
all
use
occasional
words
with
intelligent
and
intelligible
propriety
the
meaning
of
which
as
isolated
terms
we
can
not
translate
we
read
shakespeare
and
goethe
without
a
suspicion
of
the
many
words
which
for
us
have
no
images
but
if
one
of
these
words
occurs
in
an
unfamiliar
connection
we
are
at
once
arrested
as
we
are
if
any
familiar
word
is
placed
in
an
unfamiliar
position
suppose
we
come
upon
the
sentence
ship
which
carried
nelson
was
named
the
ship
which
carried
napoleon
across
the
desert
was
named
are
at
once
arrested
the
connection
of
ship
and
desert
is
unusual
and
is
seen
on
reflection
to
be
contrary
to
experience
but
when
we
learn
that
the
camel
is
called
the
of
the
desert
we
recognize
the
new
value
assigned
to
the
term
and
the
logical
correctness
of
the
phrase
is
thereby
these
examples
and
others
like
them
which
lewes
gives
bring
us
face
to
face
with
the
proposition
that
of
our
thinking
is
carried
on
by
means
of
symbols
without
any
images
which
is
the
same
thing
as
thinking
being
carried
on
by
words
without
any
meanings

with
only
the
accompanying
intuition
of
their
logical
thus
after
a
century
of
exhortation
against
the
blind
use
of
words
we
are
brought
face

question
of
using
words
in

abuse

this

to

the

sidenote
kinds
of
thinking
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
first
chapter
the
word
has
several
meanings
one
can
hardly
write
or
speak
on
education
without
using
the
word
in
more
senses
than
one
and
it
is
not
always
convenient
to
break
the
line
of
thought
or
discussion
by
indicating
with
a
definition
the
meaning
intended
this
is
a
violation
of
rule
that
no
terms
in
the
least
obscure
or
equivocal
shall
be
used
without
defining
them
pascal
possessed
one
of
the
most
remarkable
intellects
the
world
has
ever
known
his
style
has
been
described
as
a
garment
of
light
few
thinkers
have
attained
to
an
equal
degree
clearness
of
expression
and
perfect
grasp
of
the
truth
nowhere
are
these
qualities
more
essential
than
in
lectures
and
treatises
on
teaching
it
is
a
misfortune
that
so
useful
a
word
as
should
ever
be
ambiguous
the
use
of
equivocal
terms
leads
to
misunderstandings
in
theory
and
faults
in
practice
the
advantage
of
technical
terms
lies
in
the
fact
that
after
they
have
been
clearly
defined
they
can
always
be
used
in
the
same
sense
the
disadvantage
in
the
use
of
technical
terms
is
that
they
convey
no
meaning
to
minds
unfamiliar
with
the
terminology
of
the
specific
science
to
which
they
belong
hence
the
best
thinkers
can
not
escape
the
necessity
of
employing
words
in
current
use
to
convey
their
thoughts
as
soon
as
words
pass
into
common
parlance
they
acquire
a
variety
of
meanings
and
of
shades
of
meaning
the
thought
of
a
people
is
always
more
or
less
in
advance
of
their
vocabulary
the
same
word
must
be
used
in
several
meanings
because
no
other
term
equally
simple
and
convenient
can
serve
as
a
substitute
no
one
for
instance
can
write
or
speak
in
the
english
language
without
using
the
word
in
both
its
figurative
and
its
literal
sense
the
connection
must
show
what
signification
is
intended
the
same
remark
applies
to
the
word
the
connection
must
show
whether
it
is
used
in
the
colloquial
sense
of
guessing
or
in
the
logical
sense
of
a
comparison
of
two
ideas
through
their
relation
to
a
third
or
in
the
broader
sense
of
imaging
reflecting
and
reacting
upon
what
one
reads
or
hears
or
in
a
still
broader
sense
to
designate
any
form
of
mental
activity
since
the
popular
mind
employs
the
word
as
a
general
term
to
cover
the
entire
intellectual
life
it
is
convenient
to
specify
kinds
of
thinking
by
the
use
of
adjectives
like
independent
loose
continuous
organic
technical
scientific
and
other
qualifying
phrases
inasmuch
as
these
distinctions
are
made
for
the
purpose
of
characterizing
differences
observed
in
the
of
the
maturer
life
for
which
our
pupils
are
to
be
trained
it
is
helpful
to
glance
at
them
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
the
bearing
of
what
we
do
at
school
upon
habits
of
thought
beyond
the
school
sidenote
the
independent

what
is

by
an
independent

evidently
one
who
is
not
indebted
to
others
for
the
inferences
which
he
draws
or
the
conclusions
at
which
he
arrives
many
practices
at
school
are
subversive
of
habits
of
independent
thinking
the
assignment
of
lessons
of
such
length
and
difficulty
that
the
weaker
pupils
must
rely
upon
their
stronger
classmates
for
help
or
resort
to
keys
and
for
assistance
makes
them
helpless
instead
of
and
cultivates
the
memory
at
the
expense
of
the
understanding
the
lessons
should
be
graded
so
as
to
beget
the
sense
of
mastery
every
difficulty
that
is
overcome
by
a
own
efforts
tends
to
develop
in
him
an
ambition
to
conquer
other
difficulties
few
if
any
joys
can
be
compared
with
the
ecstatic
joy
of
victory
moreover
it
should
be
the
aim
of
the
teacher
to
beget
in
the
pupil
a
love
of
truth
more
potent
and
profound
than
reverence
for
a
favorite
authority
on
the
contrary
the
feeling
of
independence
and
the
desire
of
distinction
by
differing
from
other
people
may
grow
into
a
passion
this
seldom
does
much
harm
in
the
case
of
an
editor
or
a
professor
if
you
give
either
of
them
leave
to
criticise
and
to
print
he
is
well
satisfied
if
he
is
elected
to
a
board
of
managers
or
the
national
assembly
his
critical
faculty
and
his
fondness
for
finding
fault
and
thinking
differently
from
other
people
may
make
him
a
hinderance
to
the
leaders
who
must
get
things
done
or
cause
him
to
stand
apart
like
ewald
in
the
german
reichstag
as
a
party
whose
views
must
be
ignored
on
all
questions
requiring
prompt
action
or
immediate
decision
to
counteract
this
tendency
in
a
youth
of
strong
personality
it
is
difficult
to
devise
anything
better
than
the
moulding
supremacy
of
the
chastening
influence
of
a
contest
in
the
literary
society
and
the
relentless
lessons
which
a
boy
gets
on
the
when
he
will
not
play
because
the
game
does
not
go
his
way
independence
of
thought
in
the
quest
of
truth
on
the
one
hand
and
concert
of
action
for
the
public
good
on
the
other
are
two
of
the
most
useful
lessons
to
be
learned
at
school
at
this
point
there
is
room
for
a
kind
of
apart
from
a
syllabus
of
set
questions
and
leading
to
results
which
can
not
be
tabulated
in
statistics
or
averages
the
average
in
such
cases
is
untrue
as
a
guide
and
may
be
utterly
subversive
of
correct
habits
of
thinking
or
the
correct
method
of
dealing
with
the
individual
to
give
enough
optional
or
specific
work
for
the
brightest
and
not
too
much
general
or
required
work
for
the
slowest
is
an
ideal
hard
to
realize
in
the
assignment
of
work
and
yet
of
supreme
importance
in
the
endeavor
to
develop
habits
of
independent
thinking
sidenote
independent

and
popular

there
is
great
need
for
independent
thinking
under
a
system
of
popular
government
especially
on
the
part
of
those
who
exercise
the
elective
franchise
in
the
modern
caucus
or
convention
one
man
often
does

are
invited

as
the

cares
to
do

craves
a
guide
an
authority
to
relieve
him
of
the
trouble
of
thinking
for
himself
outside
of

particular
vocation
or
profession
it
is
absolutely
necessary
at
times
for
the
strongest
intellects
to
accept
the
conclusions
of
other
thinkers
the
man
who
has
been
successful
at
making
money
and
who
finds
that
his
thinking
in
financial
matters
is
trustworthy
often
makes
himself
obnoxious
by
assuming
that
his
opinions
and
conclusions
should
be
accorded
equal
weight
in
every
other
sphere
of
human
activity
there
is
no
better
place
to
teach
the
individual
his
limitations
without
destroying
his
independence
as
a
thinker

the
atmosphere
of
a
great
university

of

you

are
thoroughly
independent

show
how
often

make

indeed

loose
thinkers
it
is
always
difficult
to
retain
what
they
say
the
thinking
of
a
totally
opposite
class
of
men
resembles
the
growth
of
an
organism
they
start
from
a
germinal
idea
which
like
seed
sown
into
good
soil
begins
to
grow
throwing
out
parts
which
have
inward
connection
and
which
together
constitute
an
organic
unity
in
a
machine
any
part
can
be
replaced
by
another
in
the
organism
no
such
substitution
is
possible
for
each
organ
bears
a
life
relation
to
the
whole
and
if
it
is
wanting
the
unity
of
the
organism
is
destroyed
organic
thinking
gives
the
hearer
the
feeling
that
the
several
parts
and
inferences
of
a
discourse
are
evolved
from
his
inner
consciousness
having
had
the

he
feels

he
had
held

involves
the
speaker
supplied

conditions
of

as
the

supplies
warmth
for
vegetable
growth
the
effect
of
such
thinking
is
irresistible
the
branches
of

which
thus
grow
out
of
a
fundamental
idea

show
the
inner
relation
between
the
subjects
not
as

mere
sequence
but
as
a
living
organic
relation
have
an
educative
value
which
can
not
be
too
highly
prized
the
organic
thinker
if
he
makes
himself
understood
has
the
audience
on
his
side
and
his
cogency
can
seldom
be
refuted
except
by
showing
either
that
his
germinal
idea
is
wrong
or
that
his
conclusions
have
no
connection

harris
on
stages
of
thinking
harris
has
drawn
attention
to
three
stages
of
thinking
he
claims
that
in
the
first
stage
things
are
regarded
as
the
essential
elements
of
all
being
that
in
the
second
the
mind
discovers
relations
essential
relations
that
in
the
third
stage
the
mind
thinks
the
is
the
category
of
the
reason
just
as
relativity
is
the
category
of
the
understanding
or
atomism
the
category
of
theoretically
this
distinction
is
important
as
giving
us
a
rational
basis
for
the
knowledge
of
god
as
revealed
to
man
practically
every
child
thinks
the
idea
of
god
where
the
study
of
science
or
philosophy
leads
to
atheism
the
wish
is
always
father
to
the
thought
sidenote
technical
and
scientific
thinking
clifford
has
made
a
distinction
between
technical
and
scientific
thinking
the
former
enables
one
to
do
with
skill
and
accuracy
what
has
been
done
heretofore
the
latter
partakes
of
the
nature
of
prophecy
or
prediction
he
claims
that
scientific
as
well
as
merely
technical
thought
make
use
of
experience
to
direct
human
action
but
that
while
technical
thought
or
skill
enables
a
man
to
deal
with
the
same
circumstances
he
has
met
before
scientific
thought
enables
him
to
deal
with
circumstances
different
from
any
he
has
met
before
in
his
opinion
scientific
thought
is
human
progress
itself
an
example
or
two
can
best
be
given
in
his
own
language
you
make
a
dot
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
then
hold
a
piece
of
iceland
spar
over
it
you
will
see
not
one
dot
but
two
a
mineralogist
by
measuring
the
angles
of
a
crystal
can
tell
you
whether
or
not
it
possesses
this
property
without
looking
through
it
he
requires
no
scientific
thought
to
do
that
but
sir
rowan
hamilton
the
late
astronomer
royal
of
ireland
knowing
these
facts
and
also
the
explanation
of
them
which
fresnel
had
given
thought
about
the
subject
and
predicted
that
by
looking
through
certain
crystals
in
a
particular
direction
we
should
see
not
two
dots
but
a
continuous
circle
lloyd
made
the
experiment
and
saw
the
circle
a
result
which
had
never
been
even
suspected
this
has
always
been
considered
one
of
the
most
signal
instances
of
scientific
thought
in
the
domain
of
physics
it
is
most
distinctly
an
application
of
experience
gained
under
certain
circumstances
to
entirely
different
clifford
compares
two
achievements
in
the
domain
of
astronomy
which
help
to
set
the
distinction
between
technical
and
scientific
thought
in
a
still
clearer
light
astronomers
observed
that
the
relative
motions
of
the
sun
and
moon
recurred
all
over
again
in
the
same
order
every
nineteen
years
they
were
thus
enabled
to
predict
the
time
at
which
eclipses
would
take
place
a
calculator
at
one
of
our
great
observatories
can
do
a
great
deal
more
than
this
like
them
he
makes
use
of
past
experience
to
predict
the
future
but
he
knows
of
a
great
number
of
other
cycles
besides
the
one
of
nineteen
years
and
takes
account
of
all
of
them
and
he
can
tell
about
the
solar
eclipse
of
six
years
hence
exactly
when
it
will
be
visible
and
how
much
of
the
surface
will
be
covered
at
each
place
and
to
a
second
at
what
time
of
the
day
it
will
begin
and
finish
there
this
prediction
involves
technical
skill
of
the
highest
order
but
it
does
not
involve
scientific
thought
as
any
astronomer
will
tell
you
by
such
calculations
the
place
of
the
planet
uranus
at
different
times
of
the
year
had
been
predicted
and
set
down
the
predictions
were
not
fulfilled
then
arose
adams
and
from
the
errors
in
the
prediction
he
calculated
the
place
of
an
entirely
new
planet
that
had
never
yet
been
suspected
and
you
all
know
how
the
new
planet
was
actually
found
in
that
place
now
this
prediction
does
involve
scientific
thought
as
any
one
who
has
studied
it
will
tell
you
here
then
are
two
cases
of
thought
about
the
same
subject
both
predicting
events
by
the
application
of
previous
experience
yet
we
say
one
is
technical
and
the
other
sidenote
science
as
knowledge
of
things
in
their
causes
and
relations
the
foregoing
distinction
may
be
valuable
in
the
training
of
university
students
whose
career
is
to
be
that
of
original
research
and
discovery
but
it
has
very
little
value
for
teachers
in
schools
of
lower
grade
for
ordinary
purposes
science
is
the
knowledge
of
things
in
their
causes
and
relations
if
the
teacher
begets
the
habit
of
asking
why
and
makes
the
pupils
dissatisfied
with
simply
knowing
the
how
and
the
what
he
has
gone
far
towards
making
them
thinkers
in
the
scientific
sense
of
the
word
how
shall
the
knowledge
of
things
in
their
causes
and
relations
be
attained
the
mind
first
thinks
things
as
isolated
units
apart
from
and
without
reference
to
other
things
under
the
impulse
to
know
it
resolves
the
thing
into
its
elements
or
constituent
parts
and
then
puts
them
together
in
a
more
complete
idea
of
each
thing
as
a
whole
the
boy
whose
curiosity
impels
him
to
take
apart
a
watch
or
clock
is
following
the
bent
of
the
mind
to
proceed
analytically
if
he
does
not
try
to
put
the
pieces
together
so
that
the
reconstructed
whole
will
keep
time
as
before
he
needs
stimulus
in
the
direction
of
synthetic
thinking
soon
his
interest
in
leads
him
to
detect
similarities
between
american
watches
and
those
made
in
switzerland
and
he
learns
to
classify
to
see
a
multitude
of
details
and
peculiarities
at
a
glance
one
characteristic
or
peculiarity
bringing
to
his
mind
the
distinctive
parts
and
construction
of
every
watch
in
a
given
class
from
the
way
in
which
a
given
watch
keeps
time
he
draws
inferences
in
regard
to
the
entire
class
this
is
inductive
thinking
from
the
conclusions
he
has
framed
he
makes
up
his
mind
as
to
the
new
watch
which
the
jeweller
offers
him
for
sale
he
is
now
thinking
deductively
sidenote
distinction
between
laws
and
causes
from
thinking
things
as
units
the
mind
passes
to
thinking
the
relations
of
things
the
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
in
play
in
ministering
to
bodily
wants
occupies
the
mind
in
very
early
stages
of
thinking
the
gifts
of
the
kindergarten
appeal
to
this
tendency
in
the
mind
and
help
to
develop
it
into
habit
and
faculty
design
and
its
execution

and
end
the
tool
and
its
use
the
raw
material
and
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
to
be
used
and
the
essay
in
which
it
is
to
be
formulated
are
so
many
ways
of
thinking
things
or
ideas
in
their
relations
not
only
may
a
relation
become
a
distinct
object
of
thought
but
relations
between
relations
classes
of
relations
instance
in
simple
and
compound
proportion
thus
be
made
to
stand
apart
before
the
mind
as
distinct
objects
of
thought
the
most
important
of
all
these
relations
is
that
of
cause
and
effect
how
things
come
to
be
their
origin
and
development
the
forces
that
make
them
what
they
are
are
the
questions
of
profound
and
abiding
interest
to
the
scientific
mind
laws
are
often
spoken
of
as
if
they
were
causes
a
law
is
a
generalized
statement
of
an
invariable
sequence
of
things
or
motions
of
things
we
sometimes
personify
these
sequences
and
speak
of
them
as
if
they
were
forces
in
nature
the
laws
are
personified
as
if
they
were
conscious
beings
demanding
obedience
and
inflicting
punishment
for
disobedience
the
consciousness
of
the
personification
is
lost
and
then
along
with
spelling
nature
with
a
capital
letter
we
fall
into
the
mistake
of
making
laws
stand
for
the
maker
and
creator
of
all
things
furthermore
it
is
very
important
to
distinguish
the
ground
of
knowledge
from
causes
that
are
operative
in
the
world
outside
of
mind
the
rain
of
last
night
caused
the
streets
to
be
muddy
but
the
condition
of
the
streets
an
effect
of
rainfall
may
be
the
ground
of
our
knowledge
that
it
must
have
rained
last
night
the
fact
that
the
earth
is
flattened
at
the
poles
or
in
other
words
that
its
curvature
is
less
at
the
poles
than
at
the
equator
explains
the
fact
that
degrees
of
latitude
get
longer
as
we
approach
the
poles
the
former
is
the
cause
the
latter
is
an
effect
but
the
mind
drew
the
former
as
an
inference
from
the
determination
of
degrees
of
latitude
by
actual
measurement
the
effect
became
the
ground
of
knowledge
frequently
the
cause
is
known
or
inferred
from
its
effect
that
which
is
causal
in
the
world
of
mind
is
effect
in
the
world
outside
of
mind
and
that
which
is
effect
in
nature
becomes
the
ground
of
knowledge
in
the
processes
of
thought
from
this
point
as
we
spy
the
land
in
which
thinking
becomes
knowing
xvii
thinking
and
knowing
when
a
knowledge
is
not
in
order
the
more
of
it
he
has
the
greater
will
be
his
confusion
of
thought
when
the
facts
are
not
organized
into
faculty
the
greater
the
mass
of
them
the
more
will
the
mind
stagger
along
under
its
burden
hampered
instead
of
helped
by
its
acquisitions
spencer
that
knowledge
can
not
be
gained
without
more
or
less
of
correct
and
prolonged
thinking
is
a
practical
maxim
which
no
one
would
be
found
to
dispute
but
that
there
is
much
knowledge
which
does
not
come
by
thinking
is
a
maxim
scarcely
more
to
be
held
in
doubt
thinking
is
then
universally
recognized
as
an
important
and
even
necessary
part
of
knowing
but
it
is
not
the
whole
of
knowing
or
in
other
words
one
must
make
use
of
faculties
of
thought
as
an
indispensable
means
to
cognition
but
there
are
other
means
which
must
also
be
employed
since
it
is
not
by
thought
alone
that
the
human
mind
attains
cognition
of
knowledge

thinking
and
knowing
one
morning
a
teacher
was
awakened
by
a
noise
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
heard
and
hopes
never
to
hear
again
it
was
unlike
anything
in
his
former
experience
soon
he
began
to
distinguish
the
hissing
of
steam
and
the
moaning
of
men
but
the
cause
was
still
a
mystery
later
he
learned
that
the
blast
furnace
in
the
neighborhood
had
exploded
and
that
several
men
were
killed
and
others
had
been
seriously
injured
by
the
explosion
sidenote
interpretation
of
the
cause
of
the
noise
could
not
be
inferred
because
there
was
nothing
in
his
former
experience
with
which
it
could
be
compared
the
escaping
steam
and
the
voices
of
the
suffering
workmen
were
recognized
because
they
could
be
interpreted
in
the
light
of
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
before
in
order
that
any
one
may
derive
definite
knowledge
from
there
must
be
something
in
past
experience
to
give
meaning
to
the
new
experience

that
issues
in
knowing
is
coupled
with
a
process
of

the

the

well

to
every

any

truth
according

have

rests
upon

is
based
upon
what

and
is
further
strengthened
by
the
absence

the

sidenote
value
of
questions
when
the
knowledge
which
a
pupil
has
is
to
be
deepened
or
made
more
distinct
a
series
of
questions
may
beget
the
required
thinking
for
instance
let
us
take
the
case
of
a
pupil
who
has
reached
the
stage
where
his
knowledge
of
the
properties
of
the
parts
of
speech
should
be
made
more
complete
let
the
teacher
ask
for
the
difference
between
a
pencil
and
a
part
of
speech
between
a
noun
and
a
name
between
gender
and
sex
between
number
in
grammar
and
number
in
arithmetic
between
person
in
grammar
and
a
person
like
the
president
of
the
united
states
between
case
in
grammar
and
a
case
in
division
of
fractions
between
tense
and
time
between
mode
and
manner
between
action
and
a
verb
between
the
object
of
an
action
and
the
object
of
a
verb
comparison
will
soon
show
the
inaccuracy
of
the
statement
that
the
direct
object
of
an
action
is
in
the
accusative
case
and
the
learner
will
see
that
case
is
a
property
of
nouns
not
of
objects
and
can
not
be
predicated
of
the
object
of
an
action
but
of
the
which
the
object
of
the
action
which
word
may
be
either
in
the
nominative
or
the
accusative
case
as
the
verb
is
either
in
the
passive
or
active
voice
comparison
will
lead
the
pupil
to
see
clearly
that
gender
is
a
property
of
nouns
whereas
sex
or
the
absence
of
sex
is
predicated
of
that
for
which
nouns
stand
comparison
will
serve
to
bring
out
the
distinction
between
number
in
grammar
as
a
property
of
nouns
indicating
one
or
more
than
one
and
numbers
in
arithmetic
of
which
there
are
as
many
as
there
are
units
or
collections
of
units
in
the
universe
thinking
by
comparison
will
lead
to
the
detection
of
similarities
and
differences
to
discrimination
combination
and
generalization
and
through
these
to
more
distinct
and
more
adequate
knowledge
questions
which
draw
attention
to
likenesses
and
differences
to
causal
relations
and
logical
sequences
stimulate
analysis
and
comparison
the
resulting
judgments
clarify
the
stream
of
thought
and
push
the
boundary
of
knowledge
into
the
regions
of
the
hitherto
unknown
sidenote
theory
true
and
false
the
greatest
minds
when
working
under
the
influence
of
a
false
theory
fail
to
arrive
at

socrates
rejected
the
view
of
anaxagoras
that
the
sun
is
a
fire
because
we
can
look
at
a
fire
but
not
at
the
sun
because
plants
grow
by
sunshine
and
are
killed
by
fire

among
the
greatest

he
spent
many
nights
trying
to
find
the
method
by
which
the
baser
metals
could
be
transmuted
into
silver
and
gold
his
researches
as
an
alchemist
led
to
nothing
because
he
was
working
under
the
spell
of
a
false
theory
sidenote
scientists
faraday
acknowledged
that
he
was
often
compelled
to
give
up
his
preconceived
notions
and
in
some
cases
his
failures
are
almost
as
instructive
as
his
discoveries
it
was
characteristic
of
him
to
hold
to
his
theories
until
he
proved
them
either
true
or
false
and
he
was
ever
ready
to
reject
any
hypothesis
as
soon
as
he
found
it
inconsistent
with
the
laws
of
nature
newton
was
willing
to
suspend
judgment
for
years
upon
his
theory
of
gravitation
until
more
accurate
measurements
of
the
size
and
the
distance
showed
his
theory
and
calculations
to
be
right
socrates
advised
his
followers
to
quit
the
study
of
astronomy
probably
because
he
felt
that
in
his
time
the
data
were
not
sufficient
to
warrant
definite
conclusions
hosts
of
instances
can
be
cited

that
the

the
strongest
intellects
does
not
issue
in
knowing
when
it
is
based
upon
or
biassed
by
a
wrong
working
hypothesis
and
yet
it
must
be
confessed
that
wrong
hypotheses
may
lead
to
valuable
negative
results

the
case

investigations

exploded

room
for
the

superiority
of

in
their
love

fidelity
to

the
facility
with
which
they
construct
theories
to
account
for
observed
phenomena
in
the
patience
with
which
they
test
theory
by
fact
and
in
the
readiness
with
which
they
reject
every
hypothesis

soon
as
it
is
found
to
be
in
irreconcilable
conflict

of

said
to
be
only
ten

from

not
only
in
the
painstaking
accuracy
of
their
observations
and
in
the
surprising
fertility
with
which
they
frame
theories
but
also
in
the
habit
of
verifying
every
hypothesis
until
there
is

ground
to
establish
its

it

been
evolved
and
stated
the
instruction
may
sometimes
begin
with
a
statement
of
applications
in
order
to
prepare
the
mind
for
the
thinking
that
issues
in
knowing
the
applications
of
color
in
the
railway
service
in
navigation
and
in
the
arts
will
create
an
interest
in
the
study
of
color
without
which
the
presentation
of
the
fundamental
ideas
may
be
in
vain
several
lecturers
have
admitted
that
they
failed
in
the
presentation
of
color
lessons
to
hold
the
attention
of
their
until
they
excited
an
interest
in
color
by
indicating
important
applications
this
statement
of
applications
by
way
of
preparation
must
however
not
be
confounded
with
the
applications
which
should
follow
the
framing
of
general
propositions
and
the
cognition
of
general
truths
the
hypotheses
of
the
scientist
correspond
to
the
general
truths
and
principles
which
instruction
always
aims
to
reach
in
all
except
the
most
advanced
investigations
the
pupil
should
work
under
the
guidance
of
principles
that
have
risen
above
the
hypothetical
stage
he
should
think
under
the
inspiration
of
truths
he
should
master
the
known
in
his
chosen
field
before
he
seeks
to
enlarge
the
boundaries
of
human
knowledge
by
invasions
into
the
realm
of
the
unknown
sad
is
the
spectacle
of
a
talented

wasting
its
strength
in
fruitless
efforts
to
rediscover

is
already
well
established

formulation
of

similarity
in

the
formulation
of

in
mathematical
studies
is
sometimes
carried
to
extremes

pupil
may
at
times
be
allowed
to
work
under
the
guidance
of
principles
which
he
knows
by
implication
and
which
he
has
never
had
occasion
to
formulate
in
explicit
statements
the
formulation
of
the
principles
of
algebra
can
be
carried
into
the
statement
of
hundreds
of
general
propositions
if
the
pupil
is
asked
to
fix
all
these
in
the
crystallized
or
specific
form
given
in
the
it
may
result
in
a
prodigious
waste
of
time
furthermore
the
effort
to
follow
invariably
any
formal
steps
in
the
order
of
instruction
is
apt
to
make
the
instruction
unduly
formal
and
lifeless
no
thinker
can
afford
to
think
in
the
set
forms
of
the
syllogism
while
evolving
a
train
of
thought
conscious
conformity
to
these
hinders
progress
in
the
spontaneous
evolution
of
germinal
ideas
in
like
manner
although
the
student
of
pedagogy
may
find
a
guide
in
the
rules
and
principles
of
his
science
while
preparing
the
of
a
lesson
yet
in
giving
the
instruction
the
truth
must
be
the
object
of
chief
regard
the
centre
of
attention
in
consciousness
constant
thought
of
prescribed
steps
makes
the
teaching
stiff
and
formal
and
dissipates
the
joyous
interest
which
accompanies
free
and
spontaneous
thinking
formal
rules
are
very
often
like
hobbles
on
the
feet
of
the
horse
they
impede
his
speed
rob
him
of
half
his
power
and
energy
and
spoil
his
enjoyment
of
the
open
field
bearing
this
in
mind
the
young
teacher
will
perhaps
not
be
harmed
by
the
advice
that
in
his
teaching
he
should
ever
seek
to
lead
the
learner
to
clear
and
distinct
perception
of
likenesses
and
differences
in
the
of
each
and
every
lesson
the
newer
methods
of
teaching
a
beginner
to
read
wisely
draw
attention
to
the
points
of
similarity
and
difference
in
the
shapes
and
sounds
of
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
they
even
go
to
the
extreme
of
comparing
sounds
with
the
noises
of
animals
with
which
the
child
in
the
larger
cities
is
totally
unfamiliar
this
error
is
not
half
so
bad
as
the
opposite
extreme
very
much
of
the
bad
teaching
by
which
the
schools
are
afflicted
arises
from
the
assumption
that
the
learner
sees
the
points
of
agreement
and
difference
which
are
so
very
obvious
to
the
mature
mind
of
the
teacher
the
consequence
is
mental
confusion
and
loss
of
the
joy
of
definite
thinking
the
detection
of
likeness
in
objects
having
many
points
of
diversity
gives
the
mind
an
agreeable
surprise

emotion

pleasure
afforded

an
instance
of
how
pride
in
own
work
may
beget
a
cheap
cynicism
with
regard
to
the
work
of
others
and
how

a

it
blinds

jevons
in
his
treatise
on
the
sciences
says
is
difficult
to
find
persons
who
can
with
perfect
fairness
register
facts
for
and
against
their
own
peculiar
views
among
uncultivated
observers
the
tendency
to
remark
favorable
and
to
forget
unfavorable
events
is
so
great
that
no
reliance
can
be
placed
upon
their
supposed
observations
thus
arises
the
enduring
fallacy
that
the
changes
of
the
weather
coincide
in
some
way
with
the
changes
of
the
moon
although
exact
and
impartial
registers
give
no
countenance
to
the
fact
the
whole
race
of
prophets
and
quacks
live
on
the
overwhelming
effect
of
one
success
compared
with
hundreds
of
failures
which
are

forgotten

we
should
do
well
to
bear
in

the
ancient
story
quoted
by
bacon
of
one
who
in
pagan
times
was
shown
a
temple
with
a
picture
of
all
the
persons
who
had
been
saved
from
shipwreck
after
paying
their
vows
when
asked
whether
he
did
not
now
acknowledge
the
power
of
the
gods
he
answered
where
are
they
painted
that
were
drowned
after
their
vows
sometimes
the
feeling
that
a
given
way
of
looking
at
things
is
undoubtedly
correct
prevents
the
mind
from
thinking
at
all
a
lady
claimed
that
she
had
been
taught
to
accept
the
statements
of
the
bible
in
their
literal
sense
and
that
in
this
belief
she
was
going
to
live
and
die
she
was
asked
to
read
the
psalm
at
the
end
of
the
first
verse
she
was
asked
whether
she
could
be
anything
else
than
a
sheep
if
the
lord
was
literally
her
shepherd
when
a
little
farther
on
she
was
asked
in
what
green
pastures
she
had
been
lying
down
she
burst
into
tears
her
condition
and
that
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
others
is
correctly
given
in

of

on
the
influence
of
feeling
upon
thinking
long
as
an
opinion
is
strongly
rooted
in
the
feelings
it
gains
rather
than
loses
in
stability
by
having
a
preponderating
weight
of
argument
against
it
for
if
it
were
accepted
as
the
result
of
argument
the
refutation
of
the
argument
might
shake
the
solidity
of
the
conviction
but
when
it
rests
solely
on
feeling
the
worse
it
fares
in
argumentative
contest
the
more
persuaded
its
adherents
are
that
their
feeling
must
have
some
deeper
ground
which
the
arguments
do
not
reach
and
while
the
feeling
remains
it
is
always
throwing
up
fresh
intrenchments
of
argument
to
fill
any
breach
made
in
the
sidenote
regard
for

when
a

are

grounded
in

it
is
but
natural
that
he
should
be
unwilling
to
abandon
them
without
a
struggle
to
intrench
himself
behind
impregnable
arguments
if
he
has
reached
his
conclusions
as
the
result
of
long
and
careful
inquiry
he
has
a
right
to
hold
on
to
them
with
more
than
ordinary
tenacity
the
same
regard
for
truth
which
led
him
to
form

however
make

of
the

to
direct

the

of
the

under

the

of

flows
onward
like
the
current
of

in
the

of
a
river
when
the

movement
is

an
act
of

may
be
needed
to
bring
the
mind
back
to
the
regular
channel
there
are
forms
of
intellectual
activity
called
dreaming
reverie
and
meditation
in
which
the
ideas
follow
each
other
without
any
effort
to
regulate
them
often
they
are
fanciful
incoherent
and
illogical
they
are
suggested
by
passing
objects
by
musical
sounds
perhaps
by
the
stimulating
influence
of
a
drug
or
narcotic
few
can
start
a
train
of

winding
up
their
minds
as
they
would
a
clock
and
then
letting
it
run
down
until
the

lecture
or

is
complete
no

of
the

being
required
to
keep
the

from

be
partly
a

mostly
it
is
the

which
all
these
have
in
common
an

is
under

when
every
soldier
and
every
officer
is
subject
to
the

of
his
superior
so
that
the
entire

of
men
can
be
moved
against

at

of

a

when
the
entire

is

of

the

when
all
the

are

to
the

of

and
to
the
rules
which
he
has
laid
down
for
the

the

when

are
under

are
in

with

it

to
ascertain
the

of

which
underlie
correct

these
are
developed
and
discussed
in

that
should
be
mastered
not

by
those
who
must
meet
others
in

by
all
who

to

fortunately
the
law
of

here
comes
into
play
to
lighten
the
conscious
effort
of
the

when
the
intellect
through
the
guidance
of
a
conscious
will
has
acted
according
to
the
forms
of
thought
in
which
the
logician
can
find
no
fallacies
it
tends
to
act
again
in
that
way
and
the
next
time
a
less
expenditure
of
conscious
effort
is
required
the
thinking
of
the
teacher
if
correct
and
logical
tends
to
beget
correct
and
logical
habits
of
thought
on
the
part
of
the
pupil
it
is
a
piece
of
good
fortune
to
fall
under
the
dominating
influence
of
a
towering
intellect
for
a
time
the
growing
mind
that
is
engaged
in
thinking

and
mastering
the
speculations
the
reflections
the
reasonings
of
a
master
who
is
such
not
merely
in

but
also
in
fact
may
be
in
a
subjection
very
like
unto
intellectual

sooner
or
later
the
day
of

arrives
and
those
who
were
not

at

those
who
expect
to
spend
their

in

have
great
reason
to
strive
after
the
discipline
which
results
in
placing
all
the
powers
of
mind
and
heart
under
the
control
of
the
will
the
feelings
which
interfere
with
reflection
should
be
repressed
and
expelled
by
strenuous
effort
the
emotions
which
stimulate
thinking
should
be
cherished
and
fostered
the
inner
nexus
which
binds
ideas
in
logical
trains
of

should
be
followed
until
the

becomes
second

thinking
which
goes
forward
according
to
some
established
habit
requires
less
effort
than
intellectual
work
that
is
accompanied
with
much
volitional

this
fact
serves
as
a
valuable
indication
to
men

inspiration
of

or

and
from
motives
grounded
in

in
all
these
stages
of
growth
thinking
is
a
most
important
factor
let
us
go
into
details
for
purposes
of
illustration
the
human
will
in
its
process
of
development
starts
on
a
physical
rather
than
a
spiritual
basis
on
the
one
hand
a
want
is
felt
and
on
the
other
an
impulse
towards
the
satisfaction
of
that
want
in
course
of
time
this
impulse
or
appetence
assumes
the
form
of
intelligent
or
conscious
purpose
looking
towards
the
gratification
of
felt
wants
and
then
the
will
begins
to
show
itself
in
the
form
of
clear
definite
volitions
and
actions
the
strength
of
the
will
depends
largely
upon
these
impulses
or
appetences
and
their
strength
in
turn
depends
upon
the
health
the
temperament
the
organization
physical
and
psychical
of
the
individual
if
by
careful
diet
exercise
or
otherwise
we
invigorate
these
we
thereby
furnish
capital
that
will
in
after
years
bear
compound
interest
in
the
form
of
strong
if
the
diet
exercise
play
sleep
and
work
are
not
properly
regulated
first
by
the
parent
the
nurse
and
the
teacher
and
later
by
the
individual
himself
the
appetences
develop
into
appetites
that
enslave
the
will
and
seriously
interfere
with
its
further
growth
as
the
power
to
think
is
developed
the
will
passes
over
into
a
higher
stage
of
activity
the
very
longing
for
happiness
leads
the
child
to
impose
restrictions
upon
itself
it
feels
happy
if
it
can
secure
the
approbation
of
those
with
whom
it
associates
if
we
show
our
displeasure
at
something
it
has
done
the
little
philosopher
begins
to
practise
in
certain
directions
for
the
purpose
of
regaining
and
retaining
our
good
will
the
second
stage
is
now
reached
in
which
gives
place
to
the
will
acting
under
the
influence
of
one
or
more
ethical
ideas
the
child
at
school
is
lifted
upon
this
loftier
plane
by
the
circumstances
which
surround
him
it
must
practise
the
school
virtues
industry
obedience
and
the
like
it
accepts
certain
forms
of
in
keeping
quiet
in
abstaining
from
play
in
observing
the
rules
of
the
school
where
the
discipline
is
rigid
and
the
instruction
lacks
interest
it
may
even
conceive
of
the
school
as
a
mere

to
let
the
hours
at
school
can
be
sweetened
by
exercises
in
thinking
and
expressing
thought
to
such
an
extent
that
the
school
becomes
the
place
to
which
children
best
like
to
go
some
men
have
not
advanced
very
far
beyond
this
second
stage
in
the
growth
of
the
will
they
follow
some
regular
occupation
as
the
boy
does
in
going
to
school
they
practise
certain
forms
of
virtue
honesty
so
that
you
could
intrust
to
them
your

perfect
safety
they
break
the
sabbath
use
name
in
vain
and
commit
daily
many
other
sins
and
transgressions
occasionally
one
finds
a
school
in
which
no
pupil
would
dare
to
be
caught
telling
a
lie
and
yet
the
moral
tone
is
low
there
being
vices
which
like

to

making

out

marble
wax
or
even
out
of

genuine
thinking
in

it
is
a
species
of
doing
which
flows
from
thinking
through
willing
and
reacts
upon
the
process
of
thinking
to
see
how
a

is
made
is
better
than
to
be

but
to
make
it
by
our
own

and

is
vastly
more
educative
than
seeing
and
hearing
manual
training
tends
to
make
the
pupil
intellectually
honest
he
can
not
get
away
from
a
thought
expressed
in
wood
or
other
material
as
he
can
from
a
thought
expressed
in
language
which
may
suffice
to
suggest
his
idea
but
not
to
give
it
adequate
expression
this
influence
of
doing
upon
thinking
has
led
to
the
formulation
of
the
maxim

learn

thinking
and
doing
when
we
turn
to
modern
pedagogics
we
see
how
enormously
the
field
of
reactive
conduct
has
been
extended
by
the
introduction
of
all
those
methods
of
concrete
which
are
the
glory
of
our
contemporary
schools
verbal
reactions
useful
as
they
are
are
insufficient
the
words
may
be
right
but
the
concepts
corresponding
to
them
are
often
direfully
wrong
in
a
modern
school
therefore
they
form
only
a
small
part
of
what
the
pupil
is
required
to
do
he
must
keep
make
drawings
plans
and
maps
take
measurements
enter
the
laboratory
and
perform
experiments
consult
authorities
and
write
essays
he
must
do
in
his
fashion
what
is
often
laughed
at
by
outsiders
when
it
appears
in
prospectuses
under
the
title
of
original
work
but
what
is
really
the
only
possible
training
for
the
doing
of
original
work
thereafter
the
most
colossal
improvement
which
recent
years
have
seen
in
secondary
education
lies
in
the
introduction
of
schools
not
because
they
will
give
us
a
people
more
handy
and
practical
for
domestic
life
and
better
skill
in
trades
but
because
they
will
give
us
citizens
with
an
entirely
different
intellectual
life
laboratory
work
and
shop
work
engender
a
habit
of
observation
a
knowledge
of
the
difference
between
accuracy
and
vagueness
and
an
insight
into
complexity
and
into
the
inadequacy
of
all
abstract
verbal
accounts
of
real
phenomena
which
once
brought
into
the
mind
remain
there
as
possessions
they
confer
precision
because
if
you
are
a
thing
you
must
do
it
definitely
right
or
definitely
wrong
they
give
honesty
for
when
you
express
yourself
by
making
things
and
not
by
using
words
it
becomes
impossible
to
dissimulate
your
vagueness
or
ignorance
by
ambiguity
they
beget
a
habit
of
they
keep
the
interest
and
attention
always
cheerfully
engaged
and
reduce
the
disciplinary
function
to
a
minimum

the
best

aim
at
the

if
a

has
been
well

are
apt

make
no

inquiries
although
the
expression

is
a

there
is
often
a
wide
chasm

getting

and
having
it
done
many
of
the
reforms
and
revolutions
thought
out
by
university
professors
never

beyond

in
which
they

the

on
which
they

never
troubles
a
despotic

until
the
ideas
of
the

show

of
passing
into

life
of

the
difference
between

and
action
between
the
man
of
words
and
the
man
of
deeds
has
long
been
felt
and
emphasized
the
favorite
method
of
teaching
by
lectures
and
requiring
the
pupil
to
take
notes
fails
utterly
if
it
stops
with
mere
telling
how
a
thing
is
to
be
done
and
is
not
followed
by
actual
doing
on
the
part
of
the
learner
work
in
the
shop
in
the
field
and
in
the
factory
often
proves
more
effective
in
fitting
a
boy
to
earn
a
living
than
the
theoretical
instruction
of
the
schools
the
advantage
of
doing
over
telling
as
a
means
of
learning
has
led
to
the
formulation
of
the
maxim
learn
to
do
by
doing
and
some
educational
reformers
have
announced
the
maxim
as
a
principle
of
education
universal
in
its
application
hence
it
is
worth
while
to
clarify
its
meaning
and
to
ascertain
its
limitations
in
so
doing
we
shall
get
a
glimpse
of
the
true
relation
between
thinking
and
doing
sidenote
the
maxim
applied
to
medicine
and
surgery
a
young
man
possessed
of
unbounded
faith
in
this
maxim
came
to
town
for
the
purpose
of
practising
medicine
and
surgery
he
announced
that
if
any
persons
got
sick
he
proposed
to
give
them
medicine
in
the
hope
of
learning
the
physiological
and
therapeutic
effects
of
the
various
drugs
if
any
limbs
were
to
be
amputated
he
was
willing
to
try
his
hand
in
the
hope
of
ultimately
learning
how
to
perform
surgical
operations
he
was
too
simple
to
succeed
as
a
quack
he
did
not
get
a
single
patient
the
people
wisely
gave
him
no
opportunity
of
learning
to
do
by
doing
sidenote
the
maxim
in
the
other
professions
equally
foolish
were
it
thus
to
apply
the
maxim
to
any
of
the
other
professions
would
you
with
life
or
property
at
stake
allow
a
novice
to
plead
your
cause
at
court
in
order
that
he
might
learn
to
plead
by
pleading
who
would
waste
the
golden
sabbath
hours
in
listening
to
one
who
was
trying
to
learn
to
preach
by
preaching
the
civilized
world
regards
knowledge
which
is
the
product
of
the
act
of
learning
as
the
indispensable
guide
of
those
who
offer
their
services
at
the
bar
from
the
pulpit
or
in
the
when
a
yale
professor
was
asked
whether
study
was
required
of
those
divinely
called
to
preach
he
replied
that
he
had
read
of
but
one
instance
in
which
the
lord
condescended
to
speak
through
the
mouth
of
an
ass
sidenote
comenius
even
an
ass
may
learn
to
do
some
things
by
continually
doing
them
in
a
blind
way
and
that
too
in
spite
of
his
proverbial
stubbornness
but
such
learning
by
blind
practice
is
unworthy
of
the
of
a
being
gifted
with
human
intelligence
and
capable
it
may
be
of
filling
a
profession
instinct
may
guide
a
bee
or
a
beaver
but
knowledge
should
guide
man
in
the
arts
and
habits
which
he
acquires
this
fact
is
not
ignored
in
the
maxim
as
originally
given
by
comenius
to
be
done
should
be
learned
by
doing
them
mechanics
understand
this
well
they
do
not
give
the
apprentice
a
lecture
upon
their
trade
but
they
will
let
him
see
how
they
as
masters
do
then
they
place
the
tool
in
his
hands
teach
him
to
use
it
and
imitate
them
doing
can
be
learned
only
by
doing
writing
by
writing
painting
by
painting
and
so
there
is
in
this
statement
a
clear
recognition
on
the
one
hand
of
the
which
precedes
and
accompanies
all
intelligent
doing
and
on
the
other
of
the
practice
which
is
needful
for
the
attainment
of
skill
the
master
mechanic
seeks
first
to
give
his
apprentice
a
clear
concept
of
what
is
to
be
done
and
the
knowledge
thus
acquired
through
the
eye
and
perhaps
partly
through
hearing
directions
and
explanations
is
afterwards
put
into
practice
by
the
actual
manipulation
of
tools
and
materials
if
the
maxim
had
been
allowed
to
stand
in
this
its
original
form
and
meaning
no
one
could
have
objected
to
its
use
and
application
but
when
the
attempt
was
made
to
elevate
it
into
a
principle
of
binding
force
for
all
teaching
when
furthermore
the
form
was
shortened
so
as
to
widen
the
meaning
and
the
maxim
was
then
applied
to
regulate
the
acquisition
of
every
form
of
human
activity
both
physical
and
mental
it
is
not
surprising
that
protests
were
heard
and
the
necessity
was
felt
of
investigating
the
maxim
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
its
limitations
and
defining
its
meaning
sidenote
value
of
the
maxim
yet
we
must
not
fail
to
make
grateful
acknowledgment
of
the
services
to
education
rendered
by
those
who
lifted
the
maxim
into
prominence
how
often
were
pupils

to
learn

thing
by
doing
another

advocated

it
would

was
to
be
learned

oral
reading

was
taught

if
the
names
of
the

would
make
the
child
familiar
with
the
sounds
the
idea
of

to
be
gotten
by
naming

imitating

and
accuracy

the
use

to
be
acquired
from

analysis
familiarity
with
birds

minerals
chemicals
was
to
be
gained
from
the
learned
phraseology

sometimes
even
the

knew
very
little

technical
terms
when
the
great
ornithologist
wilson
visited
princeton

the
professor
of
natural
history
scarcely
knew
a
sparrow
from
a
woodpecker
a
great
change
has
come
over
princeton
and
all
other
higher
institutions
of
learning
and
the
new
influence
has
been
felt
in
our
high
schools
and
even
in
the
grades
below
sidenote
maxims
principles
whilst
cheerfully
acknowledging
the
value
of
the
maxim
of
comenius
we
should
nevertheless
insist
on
the
difference
between
a
maxim
which
may
regulate
our
conduct
in
specific
cases
and
a
principle
which
is
an
guide
in
operations
coleridge
says
maxim
is
a
conclusion
upon
observation
of
matters
of
fact
and
is
speculative
a
principle
has
truth
in
itself
and
is
it
is
always
dangerous
to
generalize
upon
facts
observed
in
one
realm
of
investigation
and
then
to
allow
others
to
apply
these
general
statements
to
realms
as
diverse
from
the
original
field
of
observation
as
mind
or
spirit
is
from
matter
the
disciples
in
such
cases
always
manifest
the
hidden
weaknesses
in
the
system
of
their
master
they
rush
in
where
he
would
have
feared
to
tread
they
push
his
language
to
extremes
from
which
his
deeper
insight
broader
vision
and
larger
experience
would
have
caused
him
to
shrink
comenius
framed
the
maxim
from
the
observation
of
bodily
acts
some
seek
to
apply
it
to
every
form
of
human
activity
the
original
language
has
been
twisted
into
a
statement
that
sounds
paradoxical
learn
to
do
by
what
can
these
words
mean
if
we
do
a
given
thing
what
need
is
there
of
learning
to
do
that
thing
if
we
can
not
do
the
thing
to
be
learned
by
the
doing
of
it
how
can
any
doing
on
our
part
issue
in
learning
evidently
the
maxim
in
its
modern
form
if
it
is
at
all
valid
must
partake
of
the
nature
of
a
paradox
which
though
seemingly
absurd
is
yet
true
in
essence
or
fact
for
the
purpose
of
testing
the
validity
of
a
paradoxical
statement
there
is
no
better
way
than
to
ascertain
its
possible
meanings
to
eliminate
those
evidently
not
intended
and
finally
to
investigate
the
one
or
more
senses
or
interpretations
that
may
legitimately
be
put
upon
the
language
the
investigation
will
in
this
instance
reveal
the
relation
existing
between
doing
and
the
act
of
learning
sidenote
analysis
of
the
maxim
in
the
first
place
the
maxim
can
not
mean
that
we
learn
to
do
by
every
kind
of
doing
the
kind
of
doing
by
which
the
young
man
hoped
to
learn
medicine
and
surgery
was
ridiculed
centuries
ago
no
one
in
our
day
would
advocate
mere
blind
doing
as
a
means
of
learning
the
maxim
must
refer
to
doing
guided
by
an
intelligent
will
the
doing
must
be
guided
by
thinking
that
is
based
upon
correct
and
reliable
data
or
premises
again
the
maxim
can
not
mean
that
we
learn
one
thing
by
doing
another
the
maxim
was
emphasized
in
protest
against
the
absurdity
of
some
of
our
methods
of
teaching
it
may
happen
that
the
learner
accidentally
discovers
one
thing
while
seeking
to
find
out
some
other
thing
to
expect
that
this
shall
always
be
the
case
is
to
invite
disappointment
for
instance
pupils
do
not
learn
to
spell
while
studying
books
if
attention
is
absorbed
in
the
meaning
and
is
not
drawn
in
separate
exercises
to
the
correct
orthography
of
words
that
are
apt
to
be
misspelled
sidenote
fatigue
there
is
a
third
limitation
to
the
maxim
on
the
side
of
attention
how
for
instance
is
the
art
of
writing
acquired
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
a
boy
can
not
learn
to
write
without
himself
writing
it
is
equally
true
that
he
is
not
always
learning
or
improving
in
penmanship
while
he
is
practising
with
his
pen
upon
paper
from
the
teacher
or
the
copy
he
gets
a
concept
of
the
letters
to
be
made
the
first
efforts
at
imitation
are
fraught
with
defects
the
pupil
must
clearly
recognize
wherein
he
failed
and
earnestly
strive
to
remedy
the
defects
if
the
next
attempt
is
to
be
an
improvement
the
maxim
if
here
applied
must
mean
that
the
pupil
learns
to
do
by
continually
doing
as
nearly
as
he
can
the
thing
to
be
done
with
each
step
of
progress
his
concept
of
the
form
of
the
letters
and
how
to
make
them
becomes
more
accurate
or
in
other
words
his
power
and
skill
keep
pace
with
his
knowledge
finally
after
much
practice

rivet

lose

spring

to
be
conveyed
any

which
interferes
with

between
the

is
indescribably
bad
and
should
never

a
glimpse
from
the
point
of
view
is
here
very
interesting
a
pencil
fastened
to
the
end
of
a
ruler
revolving
around
a
fixed
point
will
describe
a
circle
if
the
pencil
be
fastened
to
the
end
of
a
second
ruler
revolving
around
the
end
of
the
first
while
the
first
revolves
around
the
original
centre
the
pencil
will
describe
a
very
complicated
curve
if
three
radii
revolving
in
this
way
be
joined
together
the
pencil
at
the
end
of
the
third
can
be
made
to
describe
the
cycles
and
epicycles
by
which
the
ancient
astronomers
explained
the
movements
of
the
planets
the
modern
mathematician
has
shown
that
by
annexing
a
fourth
a
fifth
and
a
sixth
radius
each
revolving
around
the
preceding
while
the
first
is
moving
around
the
original
centre
all
curves
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
orders
can
be
described
let
any
one
examine
his
right
arm
starting
from
the
shoulder
and
ending
with
the
fingers
and
he
will
find
that
since
infancy
he
has
had
this
mechanism
for
executing
curves
and
movements
has
been
using
this
wonderful
system
of
revolving
radii
to
express
thought
and
that
it
has
been
to
him
a
source
of
skill
in
thinking
and
doing
when
viewed
in
their
anatomical
and
physiological
aspects
human
arms
and
hands
are
seen
to
be
a
still
more
wonderful
mechanism
rivalled
only
by
the
tongue
in
capability
for
describing
any
curve
and
uttering
any
kind
of
thought
whilst
the
tongue
may
speak
many
oral
languages
the
hand
writes
them
all
and
supplies
additional
methods
for
expressing

if
questioned
with
reference
to
these
and
kindred
activities
the
physiologist
would
answer
that
the
repeated
action
of
the
nerves
and
muscles
in
specific
functions
fits
them
the
better
to
act
in
the
same
functions
and
that
the
effect
of
the
exercise
of
any
function
may
be
stored
up
so
as
to
increase
the
facility
of
the
nervous
structure
to
exercise
again
every
similar
function
the
psychologist
would
say
that
any
normal
act
performed
under
the
guidance
of
an
intelligent
will
leaves
as
its
enduring
result
an
increased
power
to

its

here

is
no
language
sufficiently
strong
to
condemn
the
spirit
of
the
professor

when
he
had
demonstrated
a

in

thanked
god
that
nobody

theories

sunder

an
education
that

can
not

severely
condemned
among

reasons

it
fails
to
lay
a

on
the

the
school
that
does
not
aim
at
something
higher

equally

in

of

says

indeed
the

transcending
the
possibilities
of
a
life
that
turns
upon
feasting
and
the
things
that
can
be
bought
with

it
must
be
admitted
that
the
exercise
of
the

carries
with
it
a
certain
feeling
of
discontent

it
is
a
feeling
that

tycho
brahe
unlike
tycho
kepler
had
no
talent
for
observation
and
experimentation
but
he
was
a
great
thinker
and
excelled
as
a
mathematician
he
absorbed
copernican
ideas
and
early
grappled
with
the
problem
of
determining
the
real
paths
of
the
planets
in
his
first
attempts
he
worked
on
the
dreams
of
the
pythagoreans
concerning
figure
and
number
intercourse
with
tycho
led
him
to
reject
such
mysticism
and
to
study
on
the
planets
recorded
by
his
master
he
took
the
planet
mars
and
found
that
no
combinations
of
circles
would
give
a
path
which
could
be
reconciled
with
the
observations
in
one
case
the
difference
between
the
observed
and
his
computed
values
was
eight
minutes
and
he
knew
that
so
accurate
an
observer
as
tycho
could
not
make
an
error
so
great
he
tried
an
oval
orbit
for
mars
and
rejected
it
he
tried
an
ellipse
and
it
fitted
thus
after
more
than
four
years
of
assiduous
computation
and
after
trying
nineteen
imaginary
paths
and
rejecting
each
because
it
was
inconsistent
with
observation
kepler
in
discovered
the
truth
an
ellipse
why
did
he
not
think
of
it
before
what
a
simple
the
puzzle
is
once
solved
he
worked
out
what
are
known
as
laws
which
accorded
with
observation
but
conflicted
with
the
ptolemaic
hypothesis
thus
the
old
system
was
logically
overthrown
but
not
until
after
a
bitter
struggle
between
science
and
theology
did
the
new
system

thus
the
movements
of
sirius
led
astronomers
peters

auwers
to
infer
the
existence
of
a
satellite

was
subsequently
discovered
by

son
through
the
glass
which
they
were
completing
for

observatory
similarly
professor
wright
of
oberlin
carefully
studied
the
trenton
deposits
and
their
relations
to
the
terrace

gravel
deposits
to
the
westward
and
predicted
that
similar
paleolithic
implements
would
be
found
in
ohio
two
years
afterwards
mertz
found
eight
feet
below

a
true
paleolith
of

flint
at

can
be
no
doubt
that
newton
was
an
alchemist
and
that
he
often
labored
night
and
day
at
alchemical
experiments
but
in
trying
to
discover
the
secret
by
which
gross
metals
might
be
rendered
noble
his
lofty
powers
of
deductive
investigation
were
wholly
useless
deprived
of
all
guiding
clues
his
experiments
were
like
those
of
all
the
alchemists
purely
haphazard
and
tentative
while
his
hypothetical
and
deductive
investigations
have
given
us
a
true
system
of
the
universe
and
opened
the
way
for
almost
all
the
great
branches
of
natural
philosophy
the
whole
results
of
his
tentative
experiments
are
comprehended
