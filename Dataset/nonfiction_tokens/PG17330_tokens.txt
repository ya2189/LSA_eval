preface
professor
maspero
closes
his
history
of
egypt
with
the
conquest
of
alexander
the
great
there
is
a
sense
of
dramatic
fitness
in
this
selection
for
with
the
coming
of
the
macedonians
the
sceptre
of
authority
passed
for
ever
out
of
the
hand
of
the
egyptian
for
several
centuries
the
power
of
the
race
had
been
declining
and
foreign
nations
had
contended
for
the
vast
of
egypt
alexander
found
the
persians
virtually
rulers
of
the
land
the
ancient
people
whose
fame
has
come
down
to
us
through
centuries
untarnished
had
been
forced
to
bow
beneath
the
yoke
of
foreign
masters
and
nations
of
alien
blood
were
henceforth
to
dominate
its
history
the
first
ptolemy
founded
a
macedonian
or
greek
dynasty
that
maintained
supremacy
in
egypt
until
the
year
his
successors
were
his
lineal
descendants
and
to
the
very
last
they
prided
themselves
on
their
greek
origin
but
the
government
which
they
established
was
essentially
oriental
in
character
the
names
of
ptolemy
and
cleopatra
convey
an
egyptian
rather
than
a
greek
significance
and
the
later
rulers
of
the
dynasty
were
true
egyptians
since
their
ancestors
had
lived
in
alexandria
for
three
full
centuries
in
the
year
augustus
cæsar
conquered
the
last
of
the
ptolemies
the
famous
cleopatra
augustus
made
egypt
virtually
his
private
province
and
drew
from
it
resources
that
were
among
the
chief
elements
of
his
power
after
augustus
the
romans
continued
in
control
until
the
coming
of
the
saracens
under
amr
in
the
seventh
century
various
dynasties
of
mohammedans
covering
a
period
of
several
centuries
maintained
control
until
the
mamluks
in
overthrew
the
legitimate
rulers
to
be
themselves
overthrown
three
centuries
later
by
the
turks
under
selim
turkish
rule
was
maintained
until
near
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
the
french
under
napoleon
bonaparte
invaded
egypt
in
after
the
expulsion
of
the
french
by
the
english
the
famous
mehemet
ali
destroyed
the
last
vestiges
of
mamluk
power
and
set
up
a
sovereignty
which
was
not
disturbed
until
toward
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
events
of
the
last
years
comprising
a
short
period
of
joint
control
of
egypt
by
the
french
and
english
followed
by
the
british
occupation
are
fresh
in
the
mind
of
the
reader
what
may
be
termed
the
modern
history
of
egypt
covers
a
period
of
more
than
centuries
during
this
time
the
native
egyptian
can
scarcely
be
said
to
have
a
national
history
but
the
land
of
egypt
and
the
races
who
have
become
acclimated
there
have
passed
through
many
interesting
phases
professor
maspero
completes
the
history
of
antiquity
in
that
dramatic
scene
in
which
the
ancient
egyptian
makes
his
last
futile
struggle
for
independence
but
the
nile
valley
has
remained
the
scene
of
the
most
important
events
where
the
strongest
nations
of
the
earth
contended
for
supremacy
it
is
most
interesting
to
note
that
the
invaders
of
egypt
while
impressing
their
military
stamp
upon
the
natives
have
been
mastered
in
a
very
real
sense
by
the
spell
of
greatness
but
the
language
the
key
to
ancient
learning
and
civilisation
still
remained
a
secret
here
and
there
one
of
the
ptolemies
or
greeks
thought
it
worth
his
while
to
master
the
hieroglyphic
writing
occasionally
a
roman
of
the
later
period
may
have
done
the
same
but
such
an
accomplishment
was
no
doubt
very
unusual
from
the
first
the
subordinated
egyptians
therefore
had
no
resource
but
to
learn
the
language
of
their
conquerors
and
presently
it
came
to
pass
that
not
even
the
native
egyptian
remembered
the
elusive
secrets
of
his
own
written
language
egyptian
as
a
spoken
tongue
remained
in
a
modified
form
as
koptic
but
at
about
the
beginning
of
our
era
the
classical
egyptian
had
become
a
dead
language
no
one
any
longer
wrote
in
the
hieroglyphic
hieratic
or
demotic
scripts
in
a
word
the
hieroglyphic
writing
was
forgotten
the
reader
of
professor
pages
has
had
opportunity
to
learn
how
this
secret
was
discovered
in
the
nineteenth
century
this
information
is
further
amplified
in
the
present
volumes
and
we
see
how
in
our
own
time
the
native
egyptian
has
regained
something
of
his
former
grandeur
through
the
careful
and
scientific
study
of
monuments
inscriptions
and
works
of
art
thus
it
will
appear
in
the
curious
rounding
out
of
the
enigmatic
story
that
the
most
ancient
history
of
civilisation
becomes
also
the
newest
and
most
modern
human
history
note
it
should
be
explained
that
doctor
rappoport
in
preparing
these
volumes
has
drawn
very
largely
upon
the
authorities
who
have
previously
laboured
in
the
same
field
and
in
particular
upon
the
works
of
creasy

when

bridged

and

the
greeks
had
attained
to
a
state
of
maturity
in
the
development
of
their
national
art
and
literature
greek
culture
and
civilisation
passing
beyond
the
boundaries
of
their
national
domain
crossed
this
bridge
and
spread
over
the
asiatic
world
to
perpetuate
his
name
the
great
macedonian
king
founded
a
city
and
selected
for
this
purpose
with
extraordinary
prescience
a
spot
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
which
on
account
of
its
geographical
position
was
destined
to
become
a
centre
not
only
of
international
commerce
and
an
entrepôt
between
asia
and
europe
but
also
a
centre
of
intellectual
culture
the
policy
of
alexander
to
remove
the
barriers
between
the
greeks
and
the
asiatics
and
to
pave
the
way
for
the
union
of
the
races
of
his
vast
empire
was
continued
by
the
lagidæ
dynasty
in
egypt
with
her
independence
and
native
dynasties
egypt
had
also
lost
her
political
strength
and
unity
she
retained
however
her
ancient
institutions
her
customs
and
religious
system
the
sway
of
persian
dominion
had
passed
over
her
without
overthrowing
this
huge
rock
of
sacerdotal
power
which
deeply
rooted
with
many
ramifications
seemed
to
mock
the
wave
of
time
out
of
the
ruins
of
political
independence
still
towered
the
monuments
of
civilisation
of
a
mighty
past
which
gave
to
this
country
moral
independence
and
prevented
the
obliteration
of
nationality
it
would
have
mattered
very
little
in
the
vast
empire
of
alexander
if
one
province
had
a
special
physiognomy
it
was
different
however
with
the
lagidæ
their
power
was
concentrated
in
egypt
and
they
were
therefore
compelled
to
obliterate
the
separation
existing
between
the
conquering
and
the
conquered
races
and
fuse
them
if
possible
into
one
a
great
obstacle
which
confronted
the
macedonian
rulers
in
egypt
was
the
religion
of
the
country
the
interest
and
the
policy
of
the
lagidæ
demanded
the
removal
of
this
obstacle
not
by
force
but
by
diplomacy
greek
gods
were
therefore
identified
with
egyptian
phtah
became
hephæstos
thot
hermes
ra
helios
amon
zeus
and
in
consequence
of
a
dream
which
commanded
him
to
offer
adoration
to
a
foreign
god
ptolemy
soter
created
a
new
greek
god
who
was
of
egyptian
origin
osiris
at
that
period
was
the
great
god
of
egypt
memphis
was
the
religious
centre
of
the
cult
of
apis
the
representative
of
osiris
and
who
when
living
was
called
and
when
dead
cambyses
had
killed
the
god
or
his
representative
it
was
a
bad
move
alexander
made
sacrifices
to
him
ptolemy
soter
did
more
he
endeavoured
to
persuade
the
egyptians
that
osirapi
or
was
also
sacred
to
the
greeks
and
to
identify
him
with
some
greek
divinity
there
was
a
greek
deity
known
as
serapis
identified
with
pluton
the
god
of
hades
serapis
by
a
clever
manouvre
a
de
was
identified
with
the
lingual
similarity
and
the
fact
that
osirapi
was
the
god
of
the
egyptian
hades
made
the
identification
acceptable
like
true
greek
princes
the
ptolemies
had
broad
views
and
were
very
tolerant
keeping
the
greek
religion
themselves
they
were
favourably
disposed
towards
the
creeds
of
other
nationalities
under
their
dominion
thanks
to
this
and
tolerance
which
had
become
traditional
in
the
lagidas
family
and
which
has
only
rarely
been
imitated
to
the
detriment
of
civilisation
in
the
history
of
european
dynasties
oriental
and
hellenic
culture
could
flourish
side
by
side
this
benign
government
attracted
many
scholars
scientists
poets
and
philosophers
alexandria
became
the
intellectual
metropolis
of
the
world
and
it
might
truly
be
said
to
have
been
the
paris
of
antiquity
at
the
courts
of
the
ptolemies
the
medicis
of
egypt
the
greatest
men
of
the
age
lived
and
taught
demetrius
phalerius
one
of
the
most
learned
and
cultured
men
of
an
age
of
learning
and
knowledge
when
driven
from
his
luxurious
palace
at
athens
found
hospitality
at
the
court
of
ptolemy
soter
the
foundation
of
the
famous
museion
and
library
of
alexandria
was
most
probably
due
to
his
influence
he
advised
the
first
ptolemy
to
found
a
building
where
poets
scholars
and
philosophers
would
have
facilities
for
study
research
and
speculation
the
museion
was
similar
in
some
respects
to
the
academy
of
plato
it
was
an
edifice
where
scholars
lived
and
worked
together
mental
qualification
was
the
only
requirement
for
admission
nationality
and
creed
were
no
obstacles
to
those
whose
learning
rendered
them
worthy
of
becoming
members
of
this
ideal
academy
and
of
being
received
among
the
immortals
of
antiquity
the
museion
was
in
no
sense
a
university
but
an
academy
for
the
cultivation
of
the
higher
branches
of
learning
it
might
be
compared
in
some
respects
to
the
college
de
france
or
regarded
as
a
development
of
the
system
under
which
scholars
had
already
lived
and
worked
together
in
the
ramesseum
under
ramses
ii
the
generosity
of
the
lagidas
provided
amply
for
this
new
centre
of
learning
and
study
free
from
worldly
cares
the
scholars
could
leisurely
gather
information
and
hand
down
to
posterity
the
fruits
of
their
researches
from
all
parts
of
the
world
men
flocked
to
this
centre
of
fashionable
learning
the
birthplace
of
modern
science
all
that
was
brilliant
and
cultured
all
the
coryphées
in
the
domain
of
intellect
were
attracted
by
that
splendid
court
in
the
shade
of
the
museion
a
brilliant
assembly
ptolemy
euclid
hipparchus
apollonius
and
eratosthenes
made
great
discoveries
and
added
materially
to
the
sum
of
human
knowledge
here
euclid
wrote
his
immortal
and
herophilos
the
father
of
surgery
added
valuable
information
to
the
knowledge
of
anatomy
the
art
and
process
of
embalming
in
such
vogue
among
the
egyptians
naturally
fostered
the
advance
of
this
science
whilst
alexandria
in
abstract
speculation
could
not
rival
greece
yet
it
became
the
home
of
the
pioneers
of
positive
science
who
left
a
great
and
priceless
legacy
to
modern
civilisation
the
importance
of
this
event
the
foundation
of
the
museion
says
draper
in
his
development
of
though
hitherto
little
understood
admits
of
no
exaggeration
so
far
as
the
intellectual
progress
of
europe
is
concerned
the
museum
made
an
impression
upon
the
intellectual
career
of
europe
so
powerful
and
enduring
that
we
still
enjoy
its
results
if
the
purely
literary
productions
of
that
age
have
sometimes
been
looked
upon
with
contempt
european
intellectual
culture
is
still
greatly
indebted
to
alexandria
and
especially
for
the
patronage
she
accorded
to
the
works
of
aristotle
whilst
the
speculative
mind
was
in
later
centuries
allured
by
the
supernatural
and
the
discussion
of
the
criterion
of
truth
and
the
principles
of
morality
ended
in
the
mystic
doctrines
of
the
practical
tendencies
of
the
great
alexandrine
scholars
were
instrumental
in
laying
the
foundations
of
science
to
the
museion
were
attached
the
libraries
one
in
the
museion
itself
and
another
in
the
quarter
rhacotis
in
the
temple
of
serapis
which
contained
about
volumes
new
books
were
continually
acquired
the
librarians
had
orders
to
pay
any
sum
for
the
original
of
the
works
of
great
masters
the
ptolemies
were
not
only
patrons
of
learning
but
were
themselves
highly
educated
ptolemy
soter
was
an
historian
of
no
mean
talent
and
his
son
philadelphus
as
a
pupil
of
the
poet
philetas
and
the
philosopher
strabo
was
a
man
of
great
learning
ptolemy
iii
was
a
mathematician
and
ptolemy
philopator
who
had
erected
and
dedicated
a
temple
to
homer
was
the
writer
of
a
tragedy
the
efforts
of
the
ptolemies
to
bring
the
two
nationalities
hellenic
and
egyptian
nearer
to
each
other
to
mould
and
weld
them
into
one
if
possible
to
mix
and
mingle
the
two
civilisations
and
thus
strengthen
their
own
power
was
greatly
aided
by
the
national
character
of
the
greeks
and
the
political
position
of
the
egyptians
the
greeks
found
in
egypt
a
national
culture
and
especially
a
religious
system
the
pliant
hellenic
genius
could
not
remain
insensible
to
that
ancient
and
marvellous
civilisation
with
its
sphinxes
and
hieroglyphics
its
pyramids
and
temples
its
learning
and
thought
so
strangely
perplexing
and
interesting
to
the
greek
mind
not
only
the
magnificence
of
egyptian
art
the
majesty
of
her
temples
and
palaces
but
the
wisdom
of
her
social
and
political
institutions
impressed
the
conquerors
they
made
themselves
acquainted
with
the
institutions
of
the
country
they
studied
its
history
and
took
an
interest
in
its
religion
and
mythology
similarly
the
conquered
egyptians
who
had
preferred
the
macedonian
ruler
to
their
persian
oppressors
exhibited
a
natural
desire
to
learn
the
languages
and
habits
of
their
rulers
to
make
themselves
acquainted
with
their
knowledge
and
phases
of
thought
and
art
and
science
the
interest
of
the
greeks
was
strengthened
by
this
and
the
egyptians
were
made
to
see
their
history
in
its
proper
light
to
this
endeavour
we
owe
the
history
of
manetho
but
in
spite
of
the
policy
of
the
ptolemies
the
impressionable
nature
of
the
hellenic
character
and
the
interest
of
the
egyptians
in
spite
of
all
that
tended
to
a
fusion
of
hellenism
and
orientalism
it
never
came
to
a
proper
amalgamation
the
contradiction
between
the
philosophy
of
greece
which
was
fast
outgrowing
its
polytheism
and
olympian
worship
and
the
deeply
rooted
sacerdotal
system
of
the
pharaonian
institutions
was
too
great
and
too
flagrant
thus
there
never
was
an
phase
of
thought
but
there
was
another
civilisation
of
great
antiquity
possessing
peculiar
features
not
less
interesting
for
the
greek
mind
than
that
of
egypt
itself
with
which
hellenism
found
itself
face
to
face
in
the
ancient
land
of
the
pharaohs
it
was
the
civilisation
of
judæa
between
which
and
greek
thought
a
greater
fusion
was
effected
ii
from
time
immemorial
the
hebrew
race
with
all
its
conservative
tendencies
in
religious
matters
has
been
amenable
to
the
influence
of
foreign
culture
and
civilian
egypt
and
phoenicia
babylonia
and
assyria
hellas
and
rome
have
exercised
an
immense
influence
over
it
it
still
is
and
always
has
been
endeavouring
to
bring
into
harmony
the
exclusiveness
of
its
national
religion
with
a
desire
to
adopt
the
habits
culture
language
and
manners
of
its
neighbours
an
attempt
in
which
it
may
be
apparently
successful
for
a
certain
period
at
least
but
which
must
always
have
a
tragic
end
it
is
impossible
to
be
conservative
and
progressive
at
the
same
time
to
be
both
national
and
cosmopolitan
the
attempts
to
reconcile
religious
formalism
and
free
reasoning
have
never
succeeded
in
the
history
of
human
thought
it
soon
led
to
the
conviction
that
one
factor
must
be
sacrificed
and
as
soon
as
this
was
perceived
the
party
of
zealots
was
quickly
at
hand
to
preach
reaction
in
the
times
of
the
successors
of
alexander
the
diadochæ
and
epigones
the
seleucidæ
and
the
lagidæ
who
had
divided
the
vast
dominion
among
them
greek
influence
had
spread
all
over
palestine
greek
towns
were
founded
theatres
and
gymnasia
established
greek
art
was
admired
and
her
philosophy
studied
the
hellenic
movement
was
paramount
and
the
aristocratic
families
did
their
best
to
further
it
even
the
high
priests
like
jason
and
menelaos
who
were
supposed
to
be
the
guardians
of
the
national
exclusive
movement
favoured
greek
culture
and
institutions
in
the
mother
country
however
the
germ
of
reaction
was
always
very
strong
a
constant
opposition
was
directed
against
the
influx
of
foreign
modes
of
life
and
thought
which
effaced
and
obliterated
the
intellectual
movement
it
was
different
however
in
the
other
countries
of
macedonian
dominion
and
especially
in
egypt
alexander
the
great
who
seems
to
have
been
favourably
inclined
towards
the
jews
settled
a
number
of
them
in
alexandria
his
policy
was
kept
up
by
the
descendants
of
lagos
that
great
general
of
alexander
who
made
himself
king
of
the
province
which
was
entrusted
to
the
care
of
his
administration
egypt
became
the
resort
of
many
refugees
from
judæa
who
gradually
came
under
the
influence
of
the
dazzling
greek
thought
and
culture
so
new
and
therefore
so
attractive
to
the
semitic
mind
hellenism
and
hebraism
had
known
each
other
for
some
time
for
phoenician
merchants
and
seafarers
had
carried
the
seed
of
oriental
wisdom
to
the
distant
west
the
acquaintance
however
was
a
slight
one
at
the
court
of
the
ptolemies
on
the
threshold
of
europe
and
asia
they
met
at
last
on
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
on
the
soil
where
lay
the
traces
of
the
ancient
egyptian
civilisation
in
the
silent
avenues
of
mysterious
sphinxes
amongst
obelisks
greek
and
hebrew
thought
stood
face
to
face
the
two
civilisations
embodied
the
principles
of
the
beautiful
and
the
sublime
of
morality
and
æstheticism
of
religious
and
philosophic
speculation
the
result
of
this
meeting
marks
a
glorious
page
in
the
annals
of
human
thought
among
the
monuments
of
a
great
historic
past
the
speculative
spirit
of
the
east
made
love
to
the
plastic
beauty
of
the
west
until
at
last
they
were
united
in
happy
union
hellenic
taste
and
sense
of
beauty
and
semitic
speculation
not
only
evolved
side
by
side
in
egypt
but
mixed
and
commingled
their
thoughts
were
intertwined
and
interwoven
giving
rise
to
a
new
intellectual
movement
a
new
philosophy
of
thought
the
alexandrian
culture
during
the
reign
of
the
ptolemies
is
the
offspring
of
a
mixed
marriage
between
two
parents
belonging
to
two
widely
different
races
and
as
a
cross
breed
is
endowed
with
many
qualities
it
had
the
seriousness
of
the
one
parent
and
the
delicacy
of
the
other
the
ptolemies
encouraged
the
movement
towards
fusion
the
result
was
that
the
jews
in
egypt
not
being
hampered
by
reactionary
endeavours
from
the
side
of
conservative
parties
and
with
an
adaptability
peculiar
to
their
race
soon
acquired
the
language
of
the
people
in
whose
midst
they
dwelt
they
conversed
and
wrote
in
greek
they
moulded
and
shaped
their
own
thoughts
into
greek
form
they
clothed
the
semitic
mode
of
thinking
in
hellenic
garb
the
immediate
result
was
the
translation
of
the
pentateuch
into
greek
vanity
of
which
no
individual
or
race
is
free
had
embellished
this
literary
production
which
has
acquired
a
high
degree
of
importance
alike
among
jews
and
christians
with
many
legends
this
translation
known
as
the
septuaginta
lxx
was
followed
by
independent
histories
relating
to
biblical
events
one
of
the
best
known
authors
is
the
chronographer
demetrius
who
lived
in
the
second
half
of
the
third
century
and
whose
work
flavius
josephus
is
supposed
to
have
utilised
not
to
speak
of
the
greek
authors
in
judæa
and
syria
we
may
mention
artapanos
who
following
the
fashion
of
the
day
wrote
history
in
the
form
of
a
romance
and
showed
traces
of
an
apologetic
character
he
endeavoured
to
attribute
all
that
was
great
in
egyptian
civilisation
to
moses
this
was
due
to
the
fact
that
manetho
the
egyptian
historian
and
others
following
his
example
had
spread
fables
and
venomous
tales
about
the
ancient
sojourn
and
exodus
of
the
hebrews
and
their
leader
to
counterbalance
these
accusations
fables
had
to
be
interwoven
into
history
and
history
became
romance
moses
was
thus
identified
with
hermes
and
made
out
to
be
the
father
of
egyptian
wisdom
but
if
the
close
acquaintanceship
of
hebraism
and
hellenism
began
with
a
mere
flirtation
encouraged
by
the
rulers
of
the
land
and
kept
up
by
the
jews
who
wished
to
gain
the
favour
of
the
conquering
race
and
to
show
themselves
and
their
history
in
as
favourable
a
light
as
possible
it
soon
ended
in
a
serious
attachment
the
hebrews
made
themselves
acquainted
with
hellenic
life
and
thought
they
studied
homer
and
hesiod
empedocles
and
parmenides
plato
and
aristotle
and
they
were
startled
by
the
discovery
that
in
greek
thought
there
were
many
elements
moral
and
religious
familiar
to
them
this
enhanced
the
attraction
the
narrowness
and
exclusiveness
to
which
strict
nationality
always
gives
rise
engendering
contempt
and
hatred
for
everything
foreign
which
made
even
the
greeks
with
all
their
intellectual
culture
draw
a
line
of
demarcation
between
greek
and
barbarian
gave
way
to
a
spirit
of
cosmopolitan
breadth
of
view
which
has
only
very
rarely
been
equalled
in
history
hellenic
and
hebrew
forms
of
thought
were
brought
into
friendly
union
and
gave
birth
to
ideas
and
aspirations
of
which
humanity
may
always
be
proud
greek
æsthetic
judgment
and
semitic
mysticism
different
phases
of
thought
in
themselves
were
welded
into
one
the
religious
conceptions
of
moses
and
the
prophets
were
expressed
in
the
language
of
the
philosophical
schools
an
attempt
was
made
to
bring
into
harmony
the
dogmas
of
supernatural
revelation
and
the
fruits
of
human
speculative
thought
such
an
attempt
is
a
great
undertaking
for
if
sincerely
and
relentlessly
pursued
it
must
end
in
breaking
down
the
barriers
of
separation
in
the
establishment
of
a
common
truth
and
in
the
sacrifice
of
cherished
ideals
and
convictions
which
prove
to
be
wrong
if
carried
to
its
logical
conclusion
such
a
cosmopolitan
such
a
of
intellectual
products
must
give
rise
to
the
ennobling
idea
that
there
is
only
one
truth
and
that
the
external
forms
are
only
fleeting
waves
upon
the
vast
ocean
of
human
ideals
the
attempt
was
made
in
alexandria
by
the
philosophers
unfortunately
however
the
hebrews
with
all
their
adaptability
have
not
yet
carried
this
attempt
to
its
logical
conclusion
the
spirit
of
reaction
has
ever
and
anon
been
ready
to
crush
in
its
infancy
the
endeavour
of
truth
and
sincerity
of
and
tolerance
when
placed
before
the
question
to
be
or
not
to
be
to
be
logical
or
illogical
it
has
chosen
the
latter
and
striven
after
the
impossible
the
reconciliation
of
what
can
not
be
reconciled
without
alterations
rejections
and
selections
the
happy
marriage
of
hellenism
and
hebraism
in
egypt
had
a
tragic
end
the
union
was
dissolved
not
however
without
having
produced
its
issue
the
alexandrian
culture
which
was
carried
to
rome
by
philo
judæus
and
thus
influenced
later
european
thought

alexandria
chapter
i
egypt
conquered
by
the
greeks
the
the
way
for
the
grecian
conquest
of
egypt
had
been
preparing
for
many
years
ever
since
the
memorable
march
of
xenophon
who
led
in
the
face
of
unknown
difficulties
ten
thousand
greeks
across
asia
minor
the
greek
statesman
had
suspected
that
the
hellenic
soldier
was
capable
of
undreamed
possibilities
when
the
young
alexander
succeeding
his
father
philip
on
the
throne
of
macedonia
got
himself
appointed
general
by
the
chief
of
the
greek
states
and
marched
against
darius
codomanus
king
of
persia
at
the
head
of
the
allied
armies
it
was
not
difficult
to
foresee
the
result
the
greeks
had
learned
the
weakness
of
the
persians
by
having
been
so
often
hired
to
fight
for
them
for
a
century
past
every
persian
army
had
had
a
body
of
ten
or
twenty
thousand
greeks
in
the
van
and
without
this
guard
the
persians
were
like
a
flock
of
sheep
without
the
dog
those
countries
which
had
trusted
to
greek
mercenaries
to
defend
them
could
hardly
help
falling
when
the
greek
states
united
for
their
conquest
alexander
defeated
the
persians
under
darius
in
a
great
and
memorable
battle
near
the
town
of
issus
at
the
foot
of
the
taurus
at
the
pass
which
divides
syria
from
asia
minor
and
then
instead
of
marching
upon
persia
he
turned
aside
to
the
easier
conquest
of
egypt
on
his
way
there
he
spent
seven
months
in
the
siege
of
the
wealthy
city
of
tyre
and
he
there
punished
with
death
every
man
capable
of
carrying
arms
and
made
slaves
of
the
rest
he
was
then
stopped
for
some
time
before
the
little
town
of
gaza
where
batis
the
brave
governor
had
the
courage
to
close
the
gates
against
the
greek
army
his
angry
fretfulness
at
being
checked
by
so
small
a
force
was
only
equalled
by
his
cruelty
when
he
had
overcome
it
he
tied
batis
by
the
heels
to
his
chariot
and
dragged
him
round
the
walls
of
the
city
as
achilles
had
dragged
the
body
of
hector
on
the
seventh
day
after
leaving
gaza
he
reached
pelusium
the
most
easterly
town
in
egypt
after
a
march
of
one
hundred
and
seventy
miles
along
the
coast
of
the
mediterranean
through
a
parched
glaring
desert
which
forms
the
natural
boundary
of
the
country
while
the
fleet
kept
close
to
the
shore
to
carry
the
stores
for
the
army
as
no
fresh
water
is
to
be
met
with
on
the
line
of
march
the
egyptians
did
not
even
try
to
hide
their
joy
at
his
approach
they
were
bending
very
unwillingly
under
the
heavy
and
hated
yoke
of
persia
the
persians
had
long
been
looked
upon
as
their
natural
enemies
and
in
the
pride
of
their
success
had
added
insults
to
the
other
evils
of
being
governed
by
the
satrap
of
a
conqueror
they
had
not
even
gained
the
respect
of
the
conquered
by
their
warlike
courage
for
egypt
had
in
a
great
part
been
conquered
and
held
by
greek
mercenaries
the
persian
forces
had
been
mostly
withdrawn
from
the
country
by
sabaces
the
satrap
of
egypt
to
be
led
against
alexander
in
asia
minor
and
had
formed
part
of
the
army
of
darius
when
he
was
beaten
near
the
town
of
issus
on
the
coast
of
cilicia
the
garrisons
were
not
strong
enough
to
guard
the
towns
left
in
their
charge
the
greek
fleet
easily
overpowered
the
egyptian
fleet
in
the
harbour
of
pelusium
and
the
town
opened
its
gates
to
alexander
here
he
left
a
garrison
and
ordering
his
fleet
to
meet
him
at
memphis
he
marched
along
the
bank
to
heliopolis
all
the
towns
on

approach
opened
their
gates
to
him

who
had
been
left
without

as
satrap
of

sabaces
led
the
troops
into

memphis
had
long
been

when
not
the

of
government
in
earlier
ages
when
the
warlike
virtues
of
the
thebans
had
made
egypt
the
greatest
kingdom
in

memphis

the

of
the
delta
paid
tribute
to
thebes
but
with
the
improvements
in
navigation
the
cities
on
the
coast
rose
in
importance
the
navigation
of
the
red
sea
though
always
dangerous
became
less
dreaded
and
thebes
lost
the
toll
on
the
carrying
trade
of
the
nile
wealth
alone
however
would
not
have
given
the
sovereignty
to
lower
egypt
had
not
the
greek
mercenaries
been
at
hand
to
fight
for
those
who
would
pay
them
the
kings
of
saïs
had
guarded
their
thrones
with
greek
shields
and
it
was
on
the
rash
but
praiseworthy
attempt
of
amasis
to
lessen
the
power
of
these
mercenaries
that
they
joined
cambyses
and
egypt
became
a
persian
province
in
the
struggles
of
the
egyptians
to
throw
off
the
persian
yoke
we
see
little
more
than
the
athenians
and
spartans
carrying
on
their
old
quarrels
on
the
coasts
and
plains
of
the
delta
and
the
athenians
who
counted
their
losses
by
ships
not
by
men
said
that
in
their
victories
and
defeats
together
egypt
had
cost
them
two
hundred
triremes
hence
when
alexander
by
his
successes
in
greece
had
put
a
stop
to
the
feuds
at
home
the
mercenaries
of
both
parties
flocked
to
his
conquering
standard
and
he
found
himself
on
the
throne
of
upper
and
lower
egypt
without
any
struggle
being
made
against
him
by
the
egyptians
the
greek
part
of
the
population
who
had
been
living
in
egypt
as
foreigners
now
found
themselves
masters
egypt
became
at
once
a
greek
kingdom
as
though
the
blood
and
language
of
the
people
were
changed
at
the
bidding

as
a
triumphant
general
gains
little
from
this
easy
conquest
of
an
unwarlike
country
and
the
overthrow
of
a
crumbling
monarchy
but
as
the
founder
of
a
new
macedonian
state

scattered

egypt
after

conquest
in

form
in
which
a
government
could
be
made
to
stand
he
deserves
to
be
placed
among
the

of

we
trace
his
march
not
by
the
ruin
misery
and
anarchy
which
usually
follow
in
the
rear
of
an
army
but
by
the
building
of
new
cities
the
more
certain
administration
of
justice
the
revival
of
trade
and
the
growth
of
learning
on
reaching
memphis
his
first
care
was
to
prove
to
the
egyptians
that
he
was
come
to
their
ancient
monarchy
he
went
in
state
to
the
temple
of
apis
and
sacrificed
to
the
sacred
bull
as
the
native
kings
had
done
at
their
coronations
and
gamed
the
of
the
crowd
by
games
and
music
performed
by
skilful
greeks
for
their
amusement
illustration
phtah
the
god
of
memphis
but
though
the
temple
of
phtah
at
memphis
in
which
the
state
ceremonies
were
performed
had
risen
in
beauty
and
importance
by
the
repeated
additions
of
the
later
kings
who
had
fixed
the
seat
of
government
in
lower
egypt
yet
the
sun
or
or
the
god
of
thebes
or
as
he
was
called
by
the
greeks
was
the
god
under
whose
spreading
wings
egypt
had
seen
its
proudest
days
every
egyptian
king
had
called
himself
son
of
the
sun
those
who
had
reigned
at
thebes
had
boasted
that
they
were
by
and
when
alexander
ordered
the
ancient
titles
to
be
used
towards
himself
he
wished
to
lay
his
offerings
in
the
temple
of
this
god
and
to
be
acknowledged
by
the
priests
as
his
son
as
a
reader
of
homer
and
the
pupil
of
aristotle
he
must
have
wished
to
see
the
wonders
of
thebes
the
proper
place
for
this
ceremony
and
it
could
only
have
been
because
as
a
general
he
had
not
time
for
a
march
of
five
hundred
miles
that
he
chose
the
nearer
and
less
known
temple
of
in
the
oasis
of
ammon
one
hundred
and
eighty
miles
from
the
coast
accordingly
he
floated
down
the
river
from
memphis
to
the
sea
taking
with
him
the
troops
and
the
royal
band
of
when
he
reached
canopus
he
sailed
westward
along
the
coast
and
landed
at
rhacotis
a
small
village
on
the
spot
where
alexandria
now
stands
here
he
made
no
stay
but
as
he
passed
through
it
he
must
have
seen
at
a
glance
for
he
was
never
there
a
second
time
that
the
place
was
formed
by
nature
to
be
a
great
harbour
and
that
with
a
little
help
from
art
it
would
be
the
port
of
all
egypt
the
mouths
of
the
nile
were
too
shallow
for
the
ever
increasing
size
of
the
merchant
vessels
which
were
then
being
built
and
the
engineers
found
the
deeper
water
which
was
wanted
between
the
village
of
rhacotis
and
the
little
island
of
pharos
it
was
all
that
he
had
seen
and
admired
at
tyre
but
it
was
on
a
larger
scale
and
with
deeper
water
it
was
the
very
spot
that
he
was
in
search
of
in
every
way
suitable
for
the
greek
colony
which
he
proposed
to
found
as
the
best
means
of
keeping
egypt
in
obedience
even
before
the
time
of
homer
the
island
of
pharos
had
given
shelter
to
the
greek
traders
on
that
coast
he
gave
his
orders
to
hinocrates
the
architect
to
improve
the
harbour
and
to
lay
down
the
plan
of
his
new
city
and
the
success
of
the
undertaking
proved
the
wisdom
both
of
the
statesman
and
of
the
builder
for
the
city
of
alexandria
subsequently
became
the
most
famous
of
all
the
commercial
and
intellectual
centres
of
antiquity
from
rhacotis
alexander
marched
along
the
coast
to
parastonium
a
distance
of
about
two
hundred
miles
through
the
desert
and
there
or
on
his
way
there
he
was
met
by
the
ambassadors
from
cyrene
who
were
sent
with
gifts
to
beg
for
peace
and
to
ask
him
to
honour
their
city
with
a
visit
alexander
graciously
received
the
gifts
of
the
cyrenæans
and
promised
them
his
friendship
but
could
not
spare
time
to
visit
their
city
and
without
stopping
he
turned
southward
to
the
oasis
at
memphis
alexander
received
the
ambassadors
that
came
from
greece
to
wish
him
joy
of
his
success
he
reviewed
his
troops
and
gave
out
his
plans
for
the
government
of
the
kingdom
he
threw
bridges
of
boats
over
the
nile
at
the
ford
below
memphis
and
also
over
the
several
branches
of
the
river
he
divided
the
country
into
two
nomarchies
or
judgeships
and
to
fill
these
two
offices
of
nomarchs
or
chief
judges
the
highest
civil
offices
in
the
kingdom
he
chose
doloaspis
and
petisis
two
egyptians
their
duty
was
to
watch
over
the
due
administration
of
justice
one
in
upper
and
the
other
in
lower
egypt
and
perhaps
to
hear
appeals
from
the
lower
judges
he
left
the
garrisons
in
the
command
of
his
own
greek
generals
pantaleon
commanded
the
counts
or
who
garrisoned
memphis
and
was
governor
of
pelusium
these
were
the
chief
fortresses
in
the
kingdom
memphis
overlooked
the
delta
the
navigation
of
the
river
and
the
pass
to
upper
egypt
pelusium
was
the
harbour
for
the
ships
of
war
and
the
frontier
town
on
the
only
side
on
which
egypt
could
be
attacked
the
other
cities
were
given
to
other
governors
licidas
commanded
the
mercenaries
peucestes
and
balacrus
the
other
troops
eugnostus
was
secretary
while
æschylus
and
ephippus
were
left
as
overlookers
or
perhaps
in
the
language
of
modern
governments
as
civil
commissioners
apollonius
was
made
prefect
of
libya
of
which
district
parætonium
was
the
capital
and
cleomenes
prefect
of
arabia
at
heroopolis
in
guard
of
that
frontier
orders
were
given
to
all
these
generals
that
justice
was
to
be
administered
by
the
egyptian
nomarchs
according
to
the
common
law
or
ancient
customs
of
the
land
petisis
however
either
never
entered
upon
his
office
or
soon
quitted
it
and
doloaspis
was
left
nomarch
of
all
egypt
alexander
sent
into
the
thebaid
a
body
of
seven
thousand
samaritans
whose
quarrels
with
the
jews
made
them
wish
to
leave
their
own
country
he
gave
them
lands
to
cultivate
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
which
had
gone
out
of
cultivation
with
the
gradual
decline
of
upper
egypt
and
he
employed
them
to
guard
the
province
against
invasion
or
rebellion
he
did
not
stay
in
egypt
longer
than
was
necessary
to
give
these
orders
but
hastened
towards
the
euphrates
to
meet
darius
in
his
absence
egypt
remained
quiet
and
happy
peucestes
soon
followed
him
to
babylon
with
some
of
the
troops
that
had
been
left
in
egypt
and
cleomenes
the
governor
of
heroopolis
was
then
made
collector
of
the
taxes
and
prefect
of
egypt
cleomenes
was
a
bad
man
he
disobeyed
the
orders
sent
from
alexander
on
the
indus
and
he
seems
to
have
forgotten
the
mild
feelings
which
guided
his
master
yet
upon
the
whole
after
the
galling
yoke
of
the
persians
the
egyptians
must
have
felt
grateful
for
the
blessings
of
justice
and
good
government
at
one
time
when
passing
through
the
thebaid
in
his
barge
on
the
nile
cleomenes
was
wrecked
and
one
of
his
children
bitten
by
a
crocodile
on
this
plea
he
called
together
the
priests
probably
of
crocodilopolis
where
this
animal
was
held
sacred
and
told
them
that
he
intended
to
revenge
himself
upon
the
crocodiles
by
having
them
all
caught
and
killed
and
he
was
only
bought
off
from
carrying
his
threat
into
execution
by
the
priests
giving
him
all
the
treasure
that
they
could
get
together
alexander
had
left
orders
that
the
great
market
should
be
moved
from
canopus
to
his
new
city
of
alexandria
as
soon
as
it
should
be
ready
to
receive
it
as
the
building
went
forward
the
priests
and
rich
traders
of
canopus
in
alarm
at
losing
the
advantages
of
their
port
gave
cleomenes
a
large
sum
of
money
for
leave
to
keep
their
market
open
this
sum
he
took
and
when
the
building
at
alexandria
was
finished
he
again
came
to
canopus
and
because
the
traders
would
not
or
could
not
raise
a
second
and
larger
sum
he
carried
orders
into
execution
and
closed
the
market
of
their
city
but
instances
such
as
these
of
a
public
officer
making
use
of
dishonest
means
to
increase
the
amount
of
the
revenue
which
it
was
his
duty
to
collect
might
unfortunately
be
found
even
in
countries
which
were
for
the
most
part
enjoying
the
blessings
of
wise
laws
and
good
government
and
it
is
not
probable
that
while
alexander
was
with
the
army
in
persia
the
acts
of
fraud
and
wrong
should
have
been
fewer
in
his
own
kingdom
of
macedonia
the
dishonesty
of
cleomenes
was
indeed
equally
shown
toward
the
macedonians
by
his
wish
to
cheat
the
troops
out
of
part
of
their
pay
the
pay
of
the
soldiers
was
due
on
the
first
day
of
each
month
but
on
that
day
he
took
care
to
be
out
of
the
way
and
the
soldiers
were
paid
a
few
days
later
and
by
doing
the
same
on
each
following
month
he
at
length
changed
the
to
the
last
day
of
the
month
and
cheated
the
army
out
of
a
whole
pay
another
act
for
which
cleomenes
was
blamed
was
not
so
certainly
wrong
one
summer
when
the
harvest
had
been
less
plentiful
than
usual
he
forbade
the
export
of
grain
which
was
a
large
part
of
the
trade
of
egypt
thereby
lowering
the
price
to
the
poor
so
far
as
they
could
afford
to
purchase
such
costly
food
but
injuring
the
landowners
on
this
the
heads
of
the
provinces
sent
to
him
in
alarm
to
say
that
they
should
not
be
able
to
get
in
the
usual
amount
of
tribute
he
therefore
allowed
the
export
as
usual
but
raised
the
duty
and
he
was
reproached
for
receiving
a
larger
revenue
while
the
landowners
were
suffering
from
a
smaller
crop

alexander
lost
his
friend
hephæstion
and
in
grief
for
his
death
he
sent
to
egypt
to
enquire
of
the
oracle
at
the
temple
of
kneph
in
the
oasis
of
ammon
what
honours
he
might
pay
to
the
deceased
the
messengers
brought
him
an
answer
that
he
might
declare
hephæstion
a
demigod
and
order
that
he
should
be
worshipped
accordingly
alexander
then
sent
an
express
command
to
cleomenes
that
he
should
build
a
temple
to
his
lost
favourite
in
his
new
city
of
alexandria
and
that
the
lighthouse
which
was
to
be
built
on
the
island
of
pharos
should
be
named
after
him
and
as
modern
insurances
against
risks
by
sea
usually
begin
with
the
words
the
name
of
god
amen
so
all
contracts
between
merchants
in
the
port
of
alexandria
were
to
be
written
solemnly
the
name
of
feeling
diffident
of
enforcing
obedience
at
the
mouth
of
the
nile
while
he
was
himself
writing
from
the
sources
of
the
indus
he
added
that
if
when
he
came
to
egypt
he
found
his
wish
carried
into
effect
he
would
pardon
cleomenes
for
those
acts
of
misgovernment
of
which
he
had
been
accused
and
for
any
others
which
might
then
come
to
his
ears
a
somatophylax
in
the
macedonian
army
was
no
doubt
at
first
as
the
word
means
one
of
the
officers
who
had
to
answer
for
the
safety
perhaps
in
modern
language
a
colonel
in
the
or
household
troops
but
as
in
unmixed
monarchies
the
faithful
officer
who
was
nearest
the
person
to
whose
watchfulness
he
trusted
in
the
hour
of
danger
often
found
himself
the
adviser
in
matters
of
state
so
in
the
time
of
alexander
the
title
of
somatophylax
was
given
to
those
generals
on
whose
wisdom
the
king
chiefly
leaned
and
by
whose
advice
he
was
usually
guided
among
these
and
foremost
in
love
and
esteem
was
ptolemy
the
son
of
lagus
philip
the
father
of
alexander
had
given
arsinoë
one
of
his
relations
in
marriage
to
lagus
and
her
eldest
son
ptolemy
born
soon
after
the
marriage
was
always
thought
to
be
the
son
though
never
so
acknowledged
as
he
grew
up
he
was
put
into
the
highest
offices
by
philip
without
raising
in
the
young
mind
the
distrust
which
might
have
been
felt
if
ptolemy
could
have
boasted
that
he
was
the
elder
brother
he
earned
the
good
opinion
of
alexander
by
his
military
successes
in
asia
and
gained
his
gratitude
by
saving
his
life
when
he
was
in
danger
among
the
oxydracæ
near
the
river
indus
and
moreover
alexander
looked
up
to
him
as
the
historian
whose
literary
powers
and
knowledge
of
military
tactics
were
to
hand
down
to
the
wonder
of
future
ages
those
conquests
which
he
witnessed
victories
over
darius
and
march
to
the
river
indus
are
no
part
of
this
history
it
is
enough
to
say
that
he
died
at
babylon
eight
years
after
he
had
entered
egypt
and
his
philip
arridæus
a
unambitious
young
man
was
declared
by
the
generals
assembled
at
babylon
to
be
his
successor
his
royal
blood
united
more
voices
in
the
army
in
his
favour
than
the
warlike
and
statesmanlike
character
of
any
one
of
the
rival
generals
they
were
forced
to
be
content
with
sharing
the
provinces
between
them
as
his
lieutenants
some
hoping
to
govern
by
their
power
over
the
weak
mind
of
arridæus
and
others
secretly
meaning
to
make
themselves
independent
in
this
weighty
matter
ptolemy
showed
the
wisdom
and
judgment
which
had
already
gained
him
his
high
character
though
his
military
rank
and
skill
were
equal
to
those
of
any
one
of
generals
and
his
claim
by
birth
perhaps
equal
to
that
of
arridæous
he
was
not
one
of
those
who
aimed
at
the
throne
nor
did
he
even
aim
at
the
second
place
but
left
to
perdiccas
the
regency
with
the
care
of
the
person
in
whose
name
that
ambitious
general
vainly
hoped
to
govern
the
whole
of
conquests
but
ptolemy
more
wisely
measuring
his
strength
with
the
several
tasks
chose
the
province
of
egypt
the
province
which
cut
off
as
it
was
from
the
rest
by
sea
and
desert
was
of
all
others
the
easiest
to
be
held
as
an
independent
kingdom
against
the
power
of
perdiccas
when
egypt
was
given
to
ptolemy
by
the
council
of
generals
cleomenes
was
at
the
same
time
and
by
the
same
power
made
second
in
command
and
he
governed
egypt
for
one
year
before
arrival
that
being
in
name
the
first
year
of
the
reign
of
philip
arridæus

who
at

he

in

was

no

with
the
fixed
purpose
of
making

the
thought
of
where

high
character

generosity

skill
had
gained

services
were
valuable
to
him
and
hence
crowds
flocked
to
his
standard
on
reaching
their
provinces
the
greek
soldiers
whether
spartans
or
athenians
forgetting
the
glories
of
thermopylæ
and
marathon
and
proud
of
their
wider
conquests
under
the
late
king
always
called
themselves
macedonians
they
pleased
themselves
with
the
thought
that
the
whole
of
the
conquered
countries
were
still
governed
by
the
brother
of
alexander
and
no
one
of
his
generals
in
his
wildest
thoughts
of
ambition
whether
aiming
like
ptolemy
at
founding
a
kingdom
or
like
perdiccas
at
the
government
of
the
world
was
unwise
enough
to
throw
off
the
title
of
lieutenant
to
philip
arridæus
and
to
forfeit
the
love
of
the
macedonian
soldiers
and
his
surest
hold
on
their
loyalty
the
first
act
of
ptolemy
was
to
put
to
death
cleomenes
who
had
been
made
of
egypt
by
the
same
council
of
generals
which
had
made
ptolemy
governor
this
act
may
have
been
called
for
by
the
dishonesty
and
crooked
dealing
which
cleomenes
had
been
guilty
of
in
collecting
taxes
but
though
the
whole
tenor
of
life
would
seem
to
disprove
the
charge
we
can
not
but
fear
that
he
was
in
part
led
to
this
deed
because
he
looked
upon
cleomenes
as
the
friend
of
perdiccas
or
because
he
could
not
trust
him
in
his
plans
for
making
himself
king
of
egypt
from
the
very
commencement
of
his
government
ptolemy
prepared
for
the
war
which
he
knew
must
follow
a
declaration
of
his
designs
perhaps
better
than
any
other
general
of
alexander
he
knew
how
to
win
the
favour
of
the
people
under
his
rule
the
condition
of
the
country
quickly
improved
under
his
mild
administration
the
growing
seaport
of
alexandria
was
a
good
market
for
a
country
rich
in
natural
produce
and
above
all
marvellously
good
geographical
position
stood
her
in
good
stead
in
time
of
war
surrounded
nearly
on
all
sides
by
desert
land
the
few
inhabitants
roving
bedouins
offered
no
danger
the
land
of
the
nile
was
accessible
to
an
enemy
in
one
direction
only
along
the
coast
of
syria
this
even
teemed
with
difficulties
transports
there
could
only
be
managed
with
the
greatest
ingenuity
and
in
case
of
defeat
retreat
was
almost
impossible
on
the
other
hand
the
egyptian
army
helped
by
all
the
advantages
of
a
land
irrigated
on
the
canal
system
and
which
could
be
flooded
at
will
had
only
to
act
on
the
defensive
to
be
certain
of
victory
the
country
is
perhaps
more
open
to
an
attack
from
the
sea
but
by
a
moderately
defensive
movement
the
enemy
could
be
kept
to
the
coast
even
the
landing
there
is
scarcely
possible
on
account
of
the
natural
difficulties
at
the
mouth
of
the
nile
the
one
easy
spot
alexandria
was
so
well
fortified
that
an
invader
had
but
little
chance
of
success
about
the
time
of
death
and
to
some
extent
brought
about
by
this
event
civil
war
broke
out
in
cyrenaica
in
consequence
of
which
the
followers
of
one
party
were
forced
out
of
the
town
of
cyrene
these
joined
themselves
with
the
exiles
of
the
town
of
barca
and
together
sought
help
of
foreigners
they
placed
themselves
under
the
leadership
of
the
spartan
thibron
formerly
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
begged
by
the
exiled
cyrenians
to
help
them
he
now
directed
his
forces
against
libya
fought
a
fierce
battle
and
took
possession
of
the
harbour
of
apollonia
two
miles
distant
from
the
town
he
then
besieged
the
town
of
cyrene
and
forced
the
cyrenians
at
last
to
sue
for
peace
they
were
obliged
to
make
a
payment
of
five
hundred
talents
and
to
take
back
the
exiles
messengers
were
sent
by
thibron
to
incite
the
other
towns
in
cyrenaica
to
join
him
and
to
help
him
conquer
their
neighbour
libya
followers
were
allowed
to
plunder
and
this
led
to
quarrels
desertions
treacherous
acts
and
the
recruiting
of
his
army
from
the
peloponnesus
after
varying
fortunes
of
war
in
the
spring
of
some
of
the
cyrenians
fled
to
egypt
and
related
to
ptolemy
what
had
occurred
in
cyrenaica
begging
him
to
help
them
back
to
their
homes
the
suggestion
was
welcome
to
him
for
victory
would
be
easy
over
these
struggling
factions
he
sent
a
strong
military
and
naval
force
under
ophelas
the
macedonian
to
cyrenaica
in
the
summer
when
these
were
seen
approaching
those
exiles
who
had
found
refuge
with
thibron
decided
to
join
them
their
plan
however
was
discovered
and
they
were
put
to
death
the
leader
of
the
rabble
in
cyrene
fearful
for
his
own
safety
now
that
the
exiles
who
had
fled
to
egypt
were
returning
made
overtures
of
peace
to
thibron
and
joined
with
him
to
repulse
ophelas
the
latter
worked
with
the
utmost
caution
sent
an
army
under
epicides
of
olynth
against
tancheira
whilst
he
himself
marched
against
cyrene
illustration
the
dôm
palm
he
met
thibron
in
a
fierce
fight
the
latter
was
completely
defeated
and
fled
towards
tancheira
where
he
hoped
to
find
help
but
instead
fell
into
hands
thibron
was
given
over
to
the
people
of
tancheira
for
punishment
he
was
cruelly
scourged
and
then
dragged
to
apollonia
where
he
was
crucified
ophelas
however
was
not
able
to
conquer
the
cyrenians
until
ptolemy
himself
arrived
with
fresh
troops
overpowered
the
town
and
joined
the
province
to
his
own
satrapy
the
conquest
of
this
greek
province
was
a
gain
equally
for
himself
and
for
the
greeks
he
put
an
end
to
the
horrible
anarchy
that
prevailed
there
and
proved
himself
their
saviour
as
well
as
their
conqueror
his
name
was
now
an
honoured
one
among
all
the
greeks
when
it
was
rumoured
that
war
was
likely
to
break
out
between
ptolemy
and
the
royal
party
the
macedonians
flocked
to
alexandria
man
ready
to
give
all
and
to
sacrifice
himself
in
order
to
help
his
a
popular
belief
of
the
day
was
that
although
ptolemy
was
known
as
the
son
of
lagos
he
was
in
reality
the
son
of
philip
and
indeed
much
in
his
manner
resembled
the
great
founder
of
the
macedonian
power
amongst
the
successors
of
alexander
not
one
understood
as
well
as
he
how
to
retain
and
increase
the
power
which
he
had
won
he
recognised
also
from
the
first
the
tendency
of
the
age
the
tendency
to
split
up
the
kingdom
into
different
states
and
he
had
made
this
the
basis
of
his
policy
it
was
under
him
that
the
first
state
in
the
new
sense
of
the
word
was
founded
he
was
the
leader
of
the
new
movement
that
soon
generated
disunity
and
to
this
end
he
made
a
secret
contract
with
antipatros
against
the
regent
perdiccas
about
this
time
also
misunderstandings
between
the
regent
and
the
rulers
in
the
west
began
to
take
a
serious
aspect
at
a
great
meeting
in
babylon
in
the
summer
of
the
year
it
was
decided
that
the
body
of
alexander
was
to
be
taken
with
great
solemnity
to
the
temple
of
amon
and
that
the
equipping
and
guidance
of
the
funeral
procession
should
be
entrusted
to
arridæus
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
necessary
preparations
were
finished
the
gigantic
funeral
car
that
was
to
carry
the
kingly
bier
had
been
decorated
with
unparalleled
magnificence
without
waiting
for
orders
from
the
regent
arridæus
started
with
the
funeral
procession
from
babylon
crowds
from
far
and
near
filled
the
streets
some
curious
to
see
the
magnificent
sight
others
eager
to
show
this
last
token
of
respect
to
the
dead
king
it
was
firmly
believed
amongst
the
macedonians
that
the
country
in
which
body
had
its
last
would
become
happy
and
powerful
above
all
countries
this
prophecy
was
uttered
by
the
old
seer
telmissus
soon
after
the
death
did
ptolemy
have
this
belief
or
did
he
wish
to
make
use
of
it
there
were
probably
other
reasons
which
had
caused
him
to
enter
into
an
understanding
with
arridæus
and
to
arrange
with
him
that
he
was
to
start
without
orders
from
the
regent
he
was
afraid
that
perdiccas
in
order
to
add
to
the
solemnity
of
the
procession
would
himself
accompany
the
body
with
the
imperial
army
to
egypt
ptolemy
felt
that
his
position
in
the
lands
entrusted
to
his
care
would
be
greatly
weakened
if
a
higher
authority
than
himself
could
appear
there
with
a
military
force
arridæus
led
the
funeral
train
to
damascus
as
had
been
arranged
before
with
ptolemy
it
was
in
vain
that
one
of
generals
who
was
in
the
neighbourhood
went
to
meet
him
he
was
able
to
obtain
no
aspect
for
the
express
order
of
the
regent
the
funeral
procession
passed
damascus
on
its
way
to
egypt
ptolemy
accompanied
the
body
with
his
army
as
far
as
syria
it
was
then
taken
on
to
memphis
to
rest
there
until
it
could
be
sheltered
by
that
beautiful
sepulchre
of
the
kings
at
alexandria
action
in
starting
without
permission
and
the
defiance
of
order
were
acts
of
open
revolt
against
the
higher
authority
of
the
kingdom
perdiccas
called
all
loyal
followers
to
the
council
of
war
ptolemy
he
said
had
defied
the
order
of
the
kings
in
his
behaviour
concerning
the
funeral
procession
and
he
had
also
given
shelter
to
the
exiled
satraps
of
phrygia
he
was
prepared
for
war
which
he
hoped
to
bring
about
it
was
for
them
the
loyal
ones
to
uphold
the
dignity
of
the
kingdom
they
must
try
to
take
him
unawares
and
to
overcome
them
individually
the
question
was
if
the
egyptians
or
the
macedonians
ought
to
be
first
attacked
in
the
end
plans
were
carefully
concerted
for
an
attack
on
egypt
and
the
protection
of
europe
in
the
early
spring
of
perdiccas
and
his
colleagues
set
out
for
egypt
with
the
imperial
army
ordering
the
fleet
to
follow
and
leaving
eumenes
with
skilled
officers
and
troops
in
general
command
of
asia
minor
for
the
purpose
of
guarding
the
hellespont
at
the
egyptian
frontier
perdiccas
summoned
the
army
together
that
the
men
themselves
should
give
judgment
in
the
case
of
the
satrap
of
egypt
in
the
same
way
as
in
the
preceding
autumn
they
had
given
judgment
in
the
case
of
antigones
he
expected
a
decision
which
would
enable
him
to
finish
what
he
had
already
begun
the
accusations
were
that
he
had
refused
obedience
to
the
kings
that
he
had
fought
against
and
overcome
the
greeks
of
cyrenaica
who
had
received
freedom
from
alexander
and
that
he
had
taken
possession
of
the
body
and
carried
it
to
memphis
according
to
the
single
account
which
tells
us
of
these
proceedings
ptolemy
himself
appeared
to
conduct
his
own
defence
before
the
assembled
warriors
he
had
good
reason
for
reckoning
on
the
impression
his
confidence
in
them
would
make
upon
them
and
on
the
love
that
he
knew
the
macedonians
bore
towards
him
he
knew
too
of
the
increasing
dislike
of
the
imperial
regent
his
defence
was
heard
with
growing
approval
and
the
judgment
was
in
spite
of
this
the
regent
kept
to
the
war
the
decision
of
the
troops
alienated
him
still
more
from
them
the
war
with
egypt
was
contrary
to
their
wishes
and
they
murmured
openly
perdiccas
sought
to
put
down
the
refractory
spirit
with
a
stern
military
hand
but
the
remonstrances
of
his
officers
were
in
vain
he
treated
the
first
in
the
land
in
an
inconsiderate
and
despotic
manner
removed
the
most
deserving
from
their
command
and
trusted
himself
alone
this
same
man
who
had
climbed
the
path
to
greatness
with
so
much
foresight
energy
and
statesmanship
seemed
now
the
nearer
he
grew
to
the
summit
of
his
ambition
to
lose
all
clearness
of
sight
and
moderation
which
traits
alone
could
help
him
to
take
this
last
and
dangerous
step
he
had
the
advantage
of
tried
troops
the
elephants
of
alexander
and
the
fleet
under
the
command
of
his
was
near
the
mouth
of
the
nile
but
he
had
overstepped
the
mark
just
at
this
time
the
news
reached
him
from
asia
minor
that
eumenes
had
conquered
neoptolemas
the
governor
of
armenia
who
had
taken
the
side
of
ptolemy
with
all
the
more
hope
perdiccas
went
to
meet
the
enemy
he
reached
pelusium
undisturbed
it
was
highly
necessary
that
the
army
should
cross
to
the
pelusaic
side
of
the
nile
for
there
were
several
secure
places
there
which
if
allowed
to
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
would
endanger
the
forward
movement
illustration
a
silhouette
on
the
nile
there
were
also
plentiful
supplies
of
provisions
within
the
delta
whilst
the
way
through
the
arabia
was
sparsely
inhabited
if
he
did
not
find
the
egyptians
there
perdiccas
would
install
himself
within
one
of
the
fortresses
on
that
side
and
thence
conduct
operations
against
them
and
at
the
same
time
remain
in
connection
with
his
fleet
on
which
he
could
fall
back
in
case
of
need
to
enable
the
crossing
to
be
accomplished
as
easily
as
possible
perdiccas
ordered
the
cleaning
out
of
an
old
and
canal
that
led
up
from
the
nile
the
work
was
evidently
begun
without
much
thought
for
the
fact
had
not
been
considered
that
at
the
rising
of
the
nile
the
canal
would
want
a
much
deeper
bed
than
the
present
stream
required
the
canal
had
only
just
been
opened
up
when
the
water
rose
with
unusual
force
and
rapidity
the
dam
was
completely
destroyed
and
many
workers
lost
their
lives
during
the
disturbance
many
officers
and
men
left
the
camp
and
hurried
to
ptolemy
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
egyptian
war
the
desertion
of
so
many
important
men
made
perdiccas
think
seriously
he
summoned
the
officers
of
the
army
spoke
to
them
with
much
condescension
gave
presents
to
some
honoured
others
with
promotion
and
begged
them
for
the
sake
of
their
honour
and
for
the
cause
of
their
kings
to
fight
their
hardest
against
this
rebel
and
with
the
order
to
hold
their
men
he
left
them
the
army
was
only
told
in
the
evening
at
the
signal
for
starting
where
they
were
to
march
perdiccas
feared
on
account
of
the
desertion
that
was
taking
place
in
his
army
that
his
march
might
be
discovered
by
the
enemy
they
marched
with
great
speed
through
the
night
and
camped
at
last
on
the
side
of
the
river
at
daybreak
after
the
troops
had
rested
perdiccas
gave
the
order
to
cross
first
came
the
elephants
then
the
light
infantry
next
the
storming
party
with
ladders
and
lastly
the
pick
of
the
cavalry
who
if
the
enemy
should
burst
out
during
the
storming
could
easily
drive
them
back
perdiccas
hoped
if
he
could
only
get
a
firm
footing
on
that
side
of
the
river
to
annihilate
the
egyptian
army
easily
with
his
superior
force
he
was
right
in
feeling
that
his
macedonian
troops
when
face
to
face
with
the
enemy
would
forget
their
antipathy
to
him
and
think
only
of
their
military
honour
when
about
half
the
army
had
crossed
and
just
as
the
elephants
were
moving
towards
the
fortress
the
enemy
were
seen
hurrying
thither
with
great
speed
their
and
even
were
heard
they
reached
the
fort
before
the
macedonians
and
withdrew
into
the
shelter
of
its
walls
not
discouraged
by
this
the
infantry
stormed
the
fort
ladders
were
placed
against
the
walls
the
elephants
driven
forward
and
palisades
taken
from
their
backs
to
attack
the
ramparts
ptolemy
in
the
dress
of
a
macedonian
soldier
stood
on
the
wall
surrounded
by
a
few
selected
men
he
was
first
in
the
fight
from
where
he
stood
he
pierced
with
his
lance
the
eyes
of
the
leading
elephant
and
stabbed
the
indian
on
its
back
and
he
wounded
many
and
killed
numbers
of
the
storming
party
his
officers
and
men
fought
with
the
greatest
spirit
the
driver
of
the
second
elephant
was
killed
and
the
infantry
were
driven
back
perdiccas
led
new
troops
to
the
attack
wishing
to
take
the

all
costs

word
and

ptolemy
urged
on
his
men
who
fought
with
marvellous
endurance
the
dreadful
battle
waged
the
whole
day
many
were
killed
and
wounded
evening
came
on
and
nothing
was
decided
perdiccas
ordered
a
retreat
and
returned
to
his
camp
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
again
started
with
his
army
hoping
that
ptolemy
would
stay
in
the
fort
with
his
troops
and
that
after
a
trying
march
of
some
miles
he
perdiccas
would
be
able
to
cross
the
river
more
easily
at
daybreak
he
found
himself
opposite
one
of
the
many
islands
of
the
nile
it
was
large
enough
for
the
camp
of
a
great
army
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
of
crossing
he
decided
to
encamp
his
army
there
the
water
reached
up
to
the
knees
and
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
they
kept
their
footing
against
the
force
of
the
current

break

perdiccas
ordered
the
elephants
into
the
river
to
stand
to
the
left
of
the
fording
party
he
ordered
the
horsemen
to
stand
at
the
other
end
to
help
those
across
that
were
driven
down
by
the
current
some
had
with
great
difficulty
managed
to
get
across
others
were
still
in
the
stream
when
it
was
noticed
that
the
water
was
becoming
deeper
the
heavily
armed
men
sank
and
the
elephants
and
horses
stood
deeper
and
deeper
in
the
water
a
fearful
panic
seized
the
army
they
called
out
that
the
enemy
had
closed
in
the
canals
and
that
the
gods
had
destined
bad
weather
in
the
upper
provinces
on
account
of
which
the
river
was
swollen
those
who
understood
saw
that
the
bed
of
the
river
had
become
deepened
by
the
crossing
of
so
great
a
cavalcade
it
was
impossible
for
the
remainder
to
cross
or
for
those
on
the
island
to
return
they
were
completely
cut
off
and
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
enemy
who
were
already
seen
approaching
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
order
them
to
get
back
as
well
as
they
could
lucky
indeed
were
those
who
could
swim
and
had
sufficient
strength
to
bring
them
across

burning
logs
of

to
show
honour
to

each

there
was
no

overcoming
this
dreadful
state

night
came
on
and
curses
and
complaints
were
heard
on
all
sides
the
lives
of
so
many
brave
men
had
been
sacrificed
for
nothing
it
was
bad
enough
to
lose
the
of
their
arms
but
now
through
the
stupidity
of
their
leader
their
lives
had
been
lost
and
to
be
swallowed
by
crocodiles
was
now
the
distinguished
death
of
macedonian
warriors
many
of
the
officers
went
to
the
tent
of
the
regent
and
told
him
openly
that
he
was
the
cause
of
this
calamity
outside
the
tent
the
macedonians
yelled
beside
themselves
with
rage
about
a
hundred
of
the
officers
headed
by
the
satrap
python
refused
to
share
further
responsibility
resigned
their
commissions
and
left
the
tent
the
excitement
grew

the
troops
in
ungovernable
rage
entered
the
tent
and
threw
themselves
upon
him

first
blow
others
followed
and
after
a
desperate
but
short
struggle
perdiccas
fell
to
the
ground
covered
with
wounds
thus
died
perdiccas
in
the
third
year
of
his
regency
his
great
idea
the
unity
of
the
kingdom
entrusted
to
his
care
should
have
made
him
worthy
of
more
success
had
he
given
himself
up
to
this
idea
with
more
conscientiousness
unfortunately
with
growing
power
he
became
despotic
and
unjust
he
was
not
great
enough
to
become
the
successor
of
alexander
to
be
another
of
the
this
last
step
the
one
which
was
to
lead
him
to
his
goal
led
him
instead
to
his
death
ptolemy
soon
heard
the
news
and
the
next
morning
he
crossed
the
river
and
came
to
the
camp
he
asked
to
be
taken
to
the
kings
presented
them
and
some
of
the
nobles
with
gifts
was
kind
and
considerate
to
all
and
was
greeted
with
great
joy
then
he
called
the
troops
together
and
spoke
to
them
he
told
the
macedonians
that
it
was
only
stern
necessity
that
caused
him
to
take
up
arms
against
his
old
comrades
no
man
regretted
more
than
he
the
untimely
death
of
so
many
heroes
perdiccas
was
the
cause
of
this
calamity
he
had
but
received
his
just
punishment
now
all
enmity
was
to
be
ended
he
had
saved
as
many
as
he
could
from
death
in
the
water
and
the
corpses
which
the
river
had
brought
to
the
shore
he
had
buried
with
all
honour
and
finally
he
told
them
that
he
had
given
orders
for
the
immediate
alleviation
of
the
want
which
he
knew
was
being
felt
in
the
camp
his
speech
was
received
with
loud
cheers
he
stood
there
unhurt
and
admired
before
the
macedonians
who
but
a
few
hours
earlier
had
been
his
bitterest
foes
now
they
looked
upon
him
as
their
saviour
they
all
acknowledged
him
as
the
conqueror
and
for
the
moment
he
stood
in
unequivocal
possession
of
that
power
for
which
perdiccas
had
worked
so
hard
and
which
he
had
so
much
abused
who
was
now
to
be
successor
and
to
manage
the
kingdom
in
the
name
of
the
kings
with
one
voice
the
people
begged
ptolemy
to
undertake
this
task
the
foresight
and
presence
of
mind
of
the
son
of
lagus
were
not
clouded
by
the
allurement
of
such
an
offer
gained
by
his
sudden
change
of
fortune
at
this
supreme
moment
he
acted
with
consummate
sagacity
he
divined
that
a
refusal
of
the
proffered
honour
would
make
him
in
reality
more
powerful
although
at
the
moment
he
would
seem
to
be
acting
in
an
unselfish
manner
he
recommended
to
the
army
as
a
favour
which
he
had
to
bestow
those
he
thought
worthy
of
his
thanks
they
were
python
the
median
strategist
who
had
taken
the
first
decisive
step
against
perdiccas
and
arridæus
who
in
spite
of
orders
had
taken
the
body
of
the
king
to
egypt
these
two
were
nominated
regents
with
loud
cheers
the
macedonian
army
accordingly
chose
python
and
arridæus
as
guardians
and
as
rulers
with
unlimited
power
over
the
whole
of
conquests
but
though
none
of
the
greek
generals
who
now
held
asia
minor
syria
babylonia
thrace
or
egypt
dared
to
acknowledge
it
to
the
soldiers
yet
in
reality
the
power
of
the
guardians
was
limited
to
the
little
kingdom
of
macedonia

the
death
of
perdiccas

the
withdrawal
of

were
left
unguarded

almost
without
a
master

that
egypt
might
take

universal
policy
ptolemy
felt
he
must
possess
syria
which
would
open
up
the
way
for
him
to
the
countries
along
the
euphrates
and
the
tigris
and
also
the
island
of
cyprus
where
he
would
be
near
the
coast
of
asia
minor
he
could
not
yet
think
of
conquering
cyprus
which
had
an
important
fleet
he
felt
that
if
he
annexed
syria
either
by
diplomacy
or
by
force
the
organisation
of
the
kingdom
and
the
territorial
division
of
power
would
be
changed
in
a
tangible
manner
the
egyptian
satraps
already
possessed
some
measure
of
authority
and
he
could
also
depend
upon
the
satrap
of
syria

him
perdiccas
had
bestowed
this
satrapy
upon
laomedon
the
amphysolite
who
had
taken
no
part
in
the
great
fight
between
perdiccas
and
ptolemy
ptolemy
now
informed
him
that
he
wished
to
possess
his
satrapy
but
was
ready
to
compensate
him
with
a
sum
of
money
laomedon
refused
this
offer
with

nicanor
says
the
historian
agathareides
seeing
that
on
every
seventh
day
the
garrison
withdrew
from
the
walls
chose
that
day
for
the
assault

thus
gained
the
city

then
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
the
native
rulers
with
whom
ptolemy
was
compared
were
the
kings
of

egypt
who
like
himself
were
surrounded
by
greek

who
never
rested

was
in
form
nearly
the

in
alexandria
as
in
the
rest
of
egypt
but
in
reality
it
was
wholly
different
his
sway
over
the
egyptians
was
supported
by
greek
force
but
over
the
greeks
it
rested
on
the
broad
base
of

had

of
bearing
arms
and

meeting
in

assembly
to
explain
a
grievance
and
petition
for
its
redress
the
citizens
and

were
the
same
body
of
men
they
at
the
same
time
held
the
force
and
had
the
spirit
to
use
it
but
they
had
no
senate
no
body
of
nobles
no
political
constitution
which
might
save
their
freedom
in
after
generations
from
the
ambitious
grasp
of
the
sovereign
or
from
their
own
degeneracy
while
claiming
to
be
equal
among
themselves
they
were
making
themselves
slaves
and
though
at
present
the
government
so
entirely
bore
the
stamp
of
their
own
will
that
they
might
fancy
they
enjoyed
a
democracy
yet
history
teaches
us
that
the
simple
paternal
form
of
government
never
fails
to
become
sooner
or
later
a
cruel
tyranny
the
building
of
alexandria
must
be
held
the
of
policy
by
which
egypt
was
kept
in
obedience
here
and
afterwards
in
a
few
other
cities
such
as
ptolemais
in
the
thebaid
and
parembole
in

the
greeks
lived
without
insulting
or
troubling
the
egyptians

by
their
numbers
held
the
country

so

troops
in
garrison
it
was
a
wise
policy
to
make
no
greater
change
than
necessary
in
the
kingdom
and
to
leave
the
egyptians
under
their
own
laws
and
magistrates
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
their
own
religion
and
yet
it
was
necessary
to
have
the
country
garrisoned
with
greeks
whose
presence
in
the
old
cities
could
not
but
be
extremely
galling
to
the
egyptians
this
was
done
by
means
of
these
new
greek
cities
where
the
power
by
which
egypt
was
governed
was
stronger
by
being
united
and
less
hateful
by
being
out
of
sight
seldom
or
never
was
so
great
a
monarchy
founded
with
so
little
force
and
so
little
crime
ptolemy
however
did
not
attempt
the
difficult
task
of
uniting
the
two
races
and
of
treating
the
conquered
and
the
conquerors
as
entitled
to
the
same
privileges
from
the
time
of
necho
and
psammetichus
many
of
the
greeks
who
settled
in
egypt
intermarried
with
the
natives
and
very
much
laid
aside
their
own
habits
and
sometimes
their
offspring
after
a
generation
or
two
became
wholly
egyptian
by
the
greek
laws
the
children
of
these
mixed
marriages
were
declared
to
be
barbarians
not
greeks
but
egyptians
and
were
brought
up
accordingly
they
left
the
worship
of
jupiter
and
juno
for
that
of
isis
and
osiris
and
perhaps
the
more
readily
for
the
greater
earnestness
with
which
the
egyptian
gods
were
worshipped
we
now
trace
their
descendants
by
the
form
of
their
skulls
even
into
the
priestly
families
and
of
one
hundred
mummies
covered
with
hieroglyphics
taken
up
from
the
catacombs
near
thebes
about
twenty
show
a
european
origin
while
of
those
from
the
tombs
near
memphis
seventy
out
of
every
hundred
have
lost
their
koptic
peculiarities
it
is
easy
to
foresee
that
an
important
change
would
have
been
wrought
in
the
character
of
the
people
and
in
their
political
institutions
if
the
greek
laws
had
been
humane
and
wise
enough
to
grant
to
the
children
of
mixed
marriages
the
privileges
the
education
and
thereby
the
moral
feelings
of
the
more
favoured
parent
and
it
is
not
too
much
to
suppose
if
the
greek
law
of
marriage
had
been
altered
by
ptolemy
that
within
three
centuries
above
half
the
nation
would
have
spoken
the
greek
language
and
boasted
of
its
greek
origin
illustration
the
god
serapis
the
stimulus
given
by
ptolemy
soter
to
the
culture
of
the
age
has
been
already
mentioned
the
founding
of
the
famous
museum
and
library
of
alexandria
may
be
perhaps
regarded
as
the
of
his
political
plans
for
the
consolidation
of
his
kingdom
alexandria
became
in
fact
not
only
a
centre
of
commerce
and
government
but
also
the
intellectual
capital
of
the
greeks
but
for
this
supreme
importance
of
the
city
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
descendants
of
ptolemy
lagus
could
have
continued
to
rule
the
valley
of
the
nile
in
return
for
the
literature
which
greece
then
gave
to
egypt
she
gained
the
knowledge
of
papyrus
a
tall
rush
which
grows
wild
near
the
sources
of
the
nile
and
was
then
cultivated
in
the
egyptian
marshes
before
that
time
books
had
been
written
on
linen
wax
bark
or
the
leaves
of
trees
and
public
records
on
stone
brass
or
lead
but
the
knowledge
of
papyrus
was
felt
by
all
men
of
letters
like
the
invention
of
printing
in
modern
europe
books
were
then
known
by
many
for
the
first
time
and
very
little
else
was
afterwards
used
in
greece
or
rome
for
when
parchment
was
made
about
two
centuries
later
it
was
too
costly
to
be
used
as
long
as
papyrus
was
within
reach
copies
were
multiplied
on
frail
strips
of
this
plant
and
it
was
found
that
mere
thoughts
when
worth
preserving
were
less
liable
to
be
destroyed
by
time
than
temples
and
palaces
of
the
hardest
stone
illustration
manuscript
on
papyrus
hieroglyphics
thebes
while
egypt
under
ptolemy
was
thus
enjoying
the
advantages
of
its
insulated
position
and
cultivating
the
arts
of
peace
the
other
provinces
were
being
harassed
by
the
unceasing
wars
of
generals
who
were
aiming
like
ptolemy
at
raising
their
own
power
many
changes
had
taken
place
among
them
in
the
short
space
of
eight
years
which
had
passed
since
the
death
of
alexander
philip
arridæus
in
whose
name
the
provinces
had
been
governed
had
been
put
to
death
antigonus
was
master
of
asia
minor
with
a
kingdom
more
powerful
though
not
so
easily
guarded
as
egypt
cassander
held
macedonia
and
had
the
care
of
the
young
alexander
ægus
who
was
then
called
the
heir
to
the
whole
of
his
wide
conquests
and
whose
life
like
that
of
arridæus
was
soon
to
end
with
his
minority
lysimachus
was
trying
to
form
a
kingdom
in
thrace
and
seleucus
had
for
a
brief
period
held
babylonia
ptolemy
bore
no
part
in
the
wars
which
brought
about
these
changes
beyond
being
once
or
twice
called
upon
to
send
troops
to
guard
his
province
of
illustration
alexander
adoring
horus
but
antigonus
in
his
ambitious
efforts
to
stretch
his
power
over
all
the
provinces
had
by
force
or
by
treachery
driven
seleucus
out
of
babylon
and
forced
him
to
seek
egypt
for
safety
where
ptolemy
received
him
with
the
kindness
and
good
policy
which
had
before
gained
so
many
friends
no
arguments
of
seleucus
were
wanting
to
persuade
ptolemy
that
antigonus
was
dreaming
of
universal
conquest
and
that
his
next
attack
would
be
upon
egypt
he
therefore
sent
ambassadors
to
make
treaties
of
alliance
with
cassander
and
lysimachus
who
readily
joined
him
against
the
common
enemy
the
large
fleet
and
army
which
antigonus
got
together
for
the
invasion
of
egypt
proved
his
opinion
of
the
strength
and
skill
of
ptolemy
all
syria
except
one
or
two
cities
laid
down
its
arms
before
him
on
his
approach
but
he
found
that
the
whole
of
the
fleet
had
been
already
removed
to
the
ports
of
egypt
and
he
ordered
phoenicia
to
furnish
him
with
eight
thousand
shipbuilders
and
carpenters
to
build
galleys
from
the
forests
of
lebanon
and
antilibanus
and
ordered
syria
to
send
four
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
medimni
or
nearly
three
millions
of
bushels
of
wheat
for
the
use
of
his
army
within
the
year
by
these
means
he
raised
his
fleet
to
two
hundred
and
long
galleys
or
ships
of
war
ptolemy
was
for
a
short
time
called
off
from
the
war
in
syria
by
a
rising
in
cyrene
the
cyrenians
who
clung
to
their
doric
love
of
freedom
and
were
latterly
smarting
at
its
loss
had
taken
arms
and
were
besieging
the
egyptian
or
as
they
would
have
called
themselves
the
macedonian
garrison
who
had
shut
themselves
up
in
the
citadel
he
at
first
sent
messengers
to
order
the
cyrenians
to
return
to
their
duty
but
his
orders
were
not
listened
to
the
rebels
no
doubt
thought
themselves
safe
as
his
armies
seemed
more
wanted
on
the
eastern
frontier
his
messengers
were
put
to
death
and
the
siege
of
the
citadel
pushed
forward
with
all
possible
speed
on
this
he
sent
a
large
land
force
followed
by
a
fleet
in
order
to
crush
the
revolt
at
a
single
blow
and
the
ringleaders
were
brought
to
alexandria
in
chains
magas
a
son
of
queen
berenicê
and
stepson
of
ptolemy
was
then
made
governor
of
cyrene
when
this
trouble
at
home
was
put
an
end
to
ptolemy
crossed
over
to
cyprus
to
punish
the
kings
of
the
little
states
on
that
island
for
having
joined
antigonus
for
now
that
the
fate
of
empires
was
to
be
settled
by
naval
battles
the
friendship
of
cyprus
became
very
important
to
the
neighbouring
states
the
large
and
safe
harbours
gave
to
this
island
a
great
value
in
the
naval
warfare
between
egypt
phoenicia
and
asia
minor
alexander
had
given
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
command
of
the
sea
went
with
the
island
of
cyprus
when
he
held
asia
minor
he
called
cyprus
the
key
to
egypt
and
with
still
greater
reason
might
ptolemy
looking
from
egypt
think
that
island
the
key
to
phoenicia
accordingly
he
landed
there
with
so
large
a
force
that
he
met
with
no
resistance
he
added
cyprus
to
the
rest
of
his
dominions
he
banished
the
kings
and
made
nicocreon
governor
of
the
whole
island
from
cyprus
ptolemy
landed
with
his
army
in
upper
syria
as
the
northern
part
of
that
country
was
called
while
the
part
nearer
to
palestine
was
called
here
he
took
the
towns
of
posideion
and
and
then
marching
hastily
into
asia
minor
he
took
malms
a
city
of
cilicia
having
rewarded
his
soldiers
with
the
booty
there
seized
he
again
embarked
and
returned
to
alexandria
this
inroad
seems
to
have
been
meant
to
draw
off
the
enemy
from
and
it
had
the
effect
for
demetrius
who
commanded
the
forces
of
his
father
antigonus
in
that
quarter
marched
northward
to
the
relief
of
cilicia
but
he
did
not
arrive
there
till
fleet
was
already
under
sail
for
its
return
journey
to
egypt
ptolemy
on
reaching
alexandria
set
his
army
in
motion
towards
pelusium
on
its
way
to
palestine
his
forces
were
eighteen
thousand
foot
and
four
thousand
horse
part
macedonians
as
the
greeks
living
in
egypt
were
always
called
and
part
mercenaries
followed
by
a
crowd
of
egyptians
of
whom
some
were
armed
for
battle
and
some
were
to
take
care
of
the
baggage
he
had
thousand
greeks
and
was
met
at
gaza
by
the
young
demetrius
with
an
army
of
eleven
thousand
foot
and
hundred
horse
followed
by
elephants
and
a
body
of
barbarians
who
like
the
egyptians
in
the
army
of
ptolemy
were
not
counted
but
the
youthful
courage
of
demetrius
was
no
match
for
the
cool
skill
and
larger
army
of
ptolemy
the
elephants
were
easily
stopped
by
iron
hurdles
and
the
egyptian
army
after
gaining
a
complete
victory
entered
gaza
while
demetrius
fled
to
azotus
ptolemy
in
his
victory
showed
a
generosity
unknown
in
modern
warfare
he
not
only
gave
leave
to
the
conquered
army
to
bury
their
dead
but
sent
back
the
whole
of
the
royal
baggage
which
had
fallen
into
his
hands
and
also
those
personal
friends
of
demetrius
who
were
found
among
the
prisoners
that
is
to
say
all
those
who
wished
to
depart
as
the
larger
part
of
these
greek
armies
were
equally
ready
to
fight
on
either
side
by
this
victory
the
whole
of
phoenicia
was
again
joined
to
egypt
and
seleucus
regained
babylonia
there
by
following
the
example
of
ptolemy
in
his
good
treatment
of
the
people
and
in
leaving
them
their
own
laws
and
religion
he
founded
a
monarchy
and
gave
his
name
to
a
race
of
kings
which
rivalled
even
the
lagidæ
he
raised
up
again
for
a
short
time
the
throne
of
nebuchadnezzar
but
it
was
only
for
a
short
time
the
and
assyrians
now
yielded
the
first
rank
to
the
greeks
who
had
settled
among
them
and
the
greeks
were
more
numerous
in
the
syrian
portion
of
his
empire
accordingly
seleucus
built
a
new
capital
on
the
river
orontes
and
named
it
antioch
after
his
father
babylon
then
yielded
the
same
obedience
to
this
new
greek
city
that
memphis
paid
to
alexandria
assyria
and
babylonia
became
subject
provinces
and
the
successors
of
seleucus
who
came
to
be
known
as
selucids
styled
themselves
not
kings
of
babylon
but
of
syria
when
antigonus
who
was
in
phrygia
on
the
other
side
of
his
kingdom
heard
that
his
son
demetrius
had
been
beaten
at
gaza
he
marched
with
all
his
forces
to
give
battle
to
ptolemy
he
soon
crossed
mount
taurus
the
lofty
range
which
divides
asia
minor
from
syria
and
mesopotamia
and
joined
his
camp
to
that
of
his
son
in
upper
syria
but
ptolemy
had
gone
through
life
without
ever
making
a
hazardous
move
not
indeed
without
ever
suffering
a
loss
but
without
ever
fighting
a
battle
when
its
loss
would
have
ruined
him
and
he
did
not
choose
to
risk
his
kingdom
against
the
far
larger
forces
of
antigonus
therefore
with
the
advice
of
his
council
of
generals
he
levelled
the
fortifications
of
acre
joppa
samaria
and
gaza
and
withdrew
his
forces
and
treasure
into
egypt
leaving
the
desert
between
himself
and
the
army
of
antigonus
antigonus
could
not
safely
attempt
to
march
through
the
desert
in
the
face
of
army
he
had
therefore
first
either
to
conquer
or
gain
the
friendship
of
the
nabatæans
a
warlike
race
of
arabs
who
held
the
north
of
arabia
and
then
he
might
march
by
petra
mount
sinai
and
the
coast
of
the
red
sea
without
being
in
want
of
water
for
his
army
the
nabatæans
were
the
tribe
at
an
earlier
time
called
edomites
but
they
lost
that
name
when
they
carried
it
to
the
southern
portion
of
judæa
then
called
idumæa
for
when
the
jews
regained
idumæa
they
called
these
edomites
of
the
desert
nebaoth
or
nabatæans
the
nabatæns
professed
neutrality
between
antigonus
and
ptolemy
the
two
contending
powers
but
the
mild
temper
of
ptolemy
had
so
far
gained
their
friendship
that
the
haughty
antigonus
though
he
did
not
refuse
their
pledges
of
peace
secretly
made
up
his
mind
to
conquer
them
petra
the
city
of
the
nabatæans
is
in
a
narrow
valley
between
steep
overhanging
rocks
so
difficult
of
approach
that
a
handful
of
men
could
guard
it
against
the
largest
army
not
more
than
two
horsemen
can
ride
abreast
through
the
chasm
in
the
rock
by
which
it
is
entered
from
the
east
while
the
other
entrance
from
the
west
is
down
a
hillside
too
steep
for
a
loaded
camel
illustration
on
the
coast
of
the
red
sea
the
eastern
proverb
reminds
us
that
is
the
chief
thing
and
a
large
stream
within
the
valley
in
addition
to
the
strength
of
the
fortress
made
it
a
favourite
for
caravans
which
whether
they
were
coming
from
tyre
or
jerusalem
were
forced
to
pass
by
this
city
in
their
way
to
the
incense
country
of
arabia
felix
or
to
the
elanitic
gulf
of
the
red
sea
and
for
other
caravans
from
egypt
to
dedam
on
the
persian
gulf
these
warlike
arabs
seem
to
have
received
a
toll
from
the
caravans
and
they
held
their
rocky
fastness
unconquered
by
the
great
nations
which
surrounded
them
their
temples
and
tombs
were
cut
out
of
the
live
rock
and
hence
the
city
was
by
the
jews
named
selah
the
rock
and
by
the
greeks
named
petra
from
which
last
the
country
was
sometimes
called
arabia
petræa
antigonus
heard
that
the
nabatæans
had
left
petra
less
guarded
than
usual
and
had
gone
to
a
neighbouring
fair
probably
to
meet
a
caravan
from
the
south
and
to
receive
spices
in
exchange
for
the
woollen
goods
from
tyre
he
therefore
sent
forward
four
thousand
foot
and
six
hundred
horse
who
overpowered
the
guard
and
seized
the
city
the
arabs
when
they
heard
of
what
had
happened
returned
in
the
night
surrounded
the
place
came
upon
the
greeks
from
above
by
paths
known
only
to
themselves
and
overcame
them
with
such
slaughter
that
out
of
the
four
thousand
six
hundred
men
only
fifty
returned
to
antigonus
to
tell
the
tale
the
nabatæans
then
sent
to
antigonus
to
complain
of
this
crafty
attack
being
made
upon
petra
after
they
had
received
from
him
a
promise
of
friendship
he
endeavoured
to
put
them
off
their
guard
by
disowning
the
acts
of
his
general
he
sent
them
home
with
promises
of
peace
but
at
the
same
time
sent
forward
his
son
demetrius
with
four
thousand
horse
and
four
thousand
foot
to
take
revenge
upon
them
and
again
seize
their
city
but
the
arabs
were
this
time
upon
their
guard
the
nature
of
the
place
was
as
unfavourable
to
the
greek
arms
and
warfare
as
it
was
favourable
to
the
arabs
and
these
eight
thousand
men
the
flower
of
the
army
under
brave
demetrius
were
unable
to
force
their
way
through
the
narrow
pass
into
this
remarkable
city
had
antigonus
been
master
of
the
sea
he
might
perhaps
have
marched
through
the
desert
along
the
coast
of
the
mediterranean
to
pelusium
with
his
fleet
to
wait
upon
his
army
as
perdiccas
had
done
but
without
this
the
only
way
that
he
could
enter
egypt
was
through
the
neighbourhood
of
petra
and
then
along
the
same
path
which
the
jews
are
supposed
to
have
followed
and
the
stop
thus
put
upon
the
invasion
of
egypt
by
this
little
city
shows
us
the
strength
of
eastern
frontier
antigonus
then
led
his
army
northward
leaving
the
kingdom
of
egypt
unattacked
this
retreat
was
followed
by
a
treaty
of
peace
between
these
generals
by
which
it
was
agreed
that
each
should
keep
the
country
that
he
then
held
that
should
govern
macedonia
until
alexander
ægus
the
son
of
alexander
the
great
should
be
of
age
that
lysimachus
should
keep
thrace
ptolemy
egypt
and
antigonus
asia
minor
and
palestine
and
each
wishing
to
be
looked
upon
as
the
friend
of
the
soldiers
by
whom
his
power
was
upheld
and
the
whole
of
these
wide
conquests
kept
in
awe
added
the
very
unnecessary
article
that
the
greeks
living
in
each
of
these
countries
should
be
governed
according
to
their
own
laws
all
the
provinces
held
by
these
generals
became
more
or
less
greek
kingdoms
yet
in
no
one
did
so
many
greeks
settle
as
in
lower
egypt
though
the
rest
of
egypt
was
governed
by
egyptian
laws
and
judges
the
city
of
alexandria
was
under
macedonian
law
it
did
not
form
part
of
the
nome
of
hermopolites
in
which
it
was
built
it
scarcely
formed
a
part
of
egypt
but
was
a
greek
state
in
its
neighbourhood
holding
the
egyptians
in
a
state
of
slavery
in
that
city
no
egyptian
could
live
without
feeling
himself
of
a
conquered
race
he
was
not
admitted
to
the
privileges
of
macedonian
citizenship
while
they
were
at
once
granted
to
every
greek
and
soon
to
every
jew
who
would
settle
there
by
the
treaty
just
spoken
of
ptolemy
in
the
thirteenth
year
after
the
death
of
alexander
was
left
undisputed
master
of
egypt
during
these
years
he
had
not
only
gained
the
love
of
the
egyptians
and
alexandrians
by
his
wise
and
just
government
but
had
won
their
respect
as
a
general
by
the
skill
with
which
he
had
kept
the
war
at
a
distance
he
had
lost
and
won
battles
in
syria
in
asia
minor
in
the
island
of
cyprus
and
at
sea
but
since
perdiccas
marched
against
him
before
he
had
a
force
to
defend
himself
with
no
foreign
army
had
drunk
the
sacred
waters
of
the
nile
it
was
under
the
government
of
ptolemy
that
the
wonders
of
upper
egypt
were
first
seen
by
any
greeks
who
had
leisure
a
love
of
knowledge
and
enough
of
literature
to
examine
carefully
and
to
describe
what
they
saw
loose
and
highly
coloured
accounts
of
the
wealth
of
thebes
had
reached
greece
even
before
the
time
of
homer
and
again
through
herodotus
and
other
travellers
in
the
delta
but
nothing
was
certainly
known
of
it
till
it
was
visited
by
hecatæus
of
abdera
who
among
other
works
wrote
a
history
of
the
hyperborean
or
northern
nations
and
also
a
history
or
rather
a
description
of
egypt
part
of
which
we
now
read
in
the
pages
of
siculus
when
he
travelled
in
upper
egypt
thebes
though
still
a
populous
city
was
more
thought
of
by
the
antiquary
than
by
the
statesman
its
wealth
however
was
still
great
and
when
under
the
just
government
of
ptolemy
it
was
no
longer
necessary
for
the
priests
to
hide
their
treasures
it
was
found
that
the
temples
still
held
the
very
large
sum
of
three
hundred
talents
of
gold
and
two
thousand
three
hundred
talents
of
silver
or
above
five
million
dollars
which
had
escaped
the
plundering
hands
of
the
persian
satraps
many
of
the
theban
tombs
which
are
sets
of
rooms
tunnelled
into
the
hills
on
the
libyan
side
of
the
nile
had
even
then
been
opened
to
gratify
the
curiosity
of
the
learned
or
the
greediness
of
the
conqueror
royal
tombs
were
mentioned
in
the
records
of
the
priests
of
which
the
entrances
had
been
covered
up
with
earth
and
hidden
in
the
sloping
sides
of
the
hills
in
the
hope
that
they
might
remain
undisturbed
and
unplundered
and
might
keep
safe
the
embalmed
bodies
of
the
kings
till
they
should
rise
again
at
the
end
of
the
world
and
seventeen
of
these
had
already
been
found
out
and
broken
open
hecatæus
was
told
that
the
other
tombs
had
been
before
destroyed
and
we
owe
it
perhaps
to
this
mistake
that
they
remained
unopened
for
more
than
two
thousand
years
longer
to
reward
the
searches
of
modern
travellers
and
to
unfold
to
us
the
history
of
their
builders
the
memnonium
the
great
palace
of
ramses
was
then
standing
and
though
it
had
been
plundered
by
the
persians
the
building
itself
was
unhurt
its
massive
walls
had
scarcely
felt
the
wear
of
the
centuries
which
had
rolled
over
them
hecataaus
measured
its
rooms
its
courtyards
and
its
avenue
of
sphinxes
and
by
his
measurements
we
can
now
distinguish
its
ruins
from
those
of
the
other
palaces
of
thebes
one
of
its
rooms
perhaps
after
the
days
of
its
builder
had
been
fitted
up
as
a
library
and
held
the
histories
and
records
of
the
priests
but
the
golden
zodiac
or
circle
on
which
were
engraved
the
days
of
the
year
with
the
celestial
bodies
seen
to
rise
at
sunrise
and
set
at
sunset
by
which
each
day
was
known
had
been
taken
away
by
cambyses
hecataaus
also
saw
the
three
other
of
thebes
which
we
now
call
by
the
names
of
the
villages
in
which
they
stand
namely
of
luxor
of
karnak
and
of
but
the
greeks
in
their
accounts
of
egypt
have
sadly
puzzled
us
by
their
careless
alteration
of
names
from
similarity
of
sound
to
miamun
ramses
they
gave
the
common
greek
name
memnon
and
the
city
of
hahiroth
they
called
heroopolis
as
if
it
meant
the
of
the
capital
of
upper
egypt
which
was
called
the
city
as
a
capital
is
often
called
or
in
koptic
or
they
named
thebes
and
in
their
mythology
they
confounded
it
with
thebes
in
bootia
the
city
of
the
god
kneph
they
called
canopus
and
said
it
was
so
named
after
the
pilot
of
menelaus
the
hill
of
toorah
opposite
memphis
they
called
the
trojan
mountain
one
of
the
oldest
cities
in
egypt
this
or
with
the
prefix
for
city
abouthis
they
called
abydos
and
then
said
that
it
was
colonised
by
milesians
from
abydos
in
asia
in
the
same
careless
way
have
the
greeks
given
us
an
account
of
the
egyptian
gods
they
thought
them
the
same
as
their
own
though
with
new
faces
and
instead
of
describing
their
qualities
they
have
in
the
main
contented
themselves
with
translating
their
names
if
ptolemy
did
not
make
his
government
as
much
feared
by
the
ethiopians
as
it
was
by
the
europeans
it
must
have
been
because
the
thebans
wished
to
guard
their
own
frontier
rather
than
because
his
troops
were
always
wanted
against
a
more
powerful
enemy
but
the
inroads
of
the
ethiopians
were
so
far
from
being
checked
that
the
country
to
the
south
of
thebes
was
unsafe
for
travellers
and
no
greek
was
able
to
reach
syênê
and
the
lower
cataracts
during
his
reign
the
trade
through
ethiopia
was
wholly
stopped
and
the
caravans
went
from
thebes
to
cosseir
to
meet
the
ships
which
brought
the
goods
of
arabia
and
india
from
the
opposite
coast
of
the
red
sea
in
the
wars
between
egypt
and
asia
minor
in
which
palestine
had
the
misfortune
to
be
the
prize
struggled
for
and
the
debatable
land
on
which
the
battles
were
fought
the
jews
were
often
made
to
smart
under
the
stern
pride
of
antigonus
and
to
rejoice
at
the
milder
temper
of
ptolemy
the
egyptians
of
the
delta
and
the
jews
had
always
been
friends
and
hence
when
ptolemy
promised
to
treat
the
jews
with
the
same
kindness
as
the
greeks
and
more
than
the
egyptians
and
held
out
all
the
rights
of
macedonian
citizenship
to
those
who
would
settle
in
his
rising
city
of
alexandria
he
was
followed
by
crowds
of
industrious
traders
manufacturers
and
men
of
letters
they
chose
to
live
in
egypt
in
peace
and
wealth
rather
than
to
stay
in
palestine
in
the
daily
fear
of
having
their
houses
sacked
and
burnt
at
every
fresh
quarrel
between
ptolemy
and
antigonus
in
alexandria
a
suburb
by
the
sea
on
the
east
side
of
the
city
was
allotted
for
their
use
which
was
afterwards
included
within
the
fortifications
and
thus
made
a
fifth
ward
of
the
lagid
metropolis
no
sooner
was
the
peace
agreed
upon
between
the
four
generals
who
were
the
most
powerful
kings
in
the
known
world
than
cassander
who
held
macedonia
put
to
death
both
the
queen
roxana
and
her
son
the
young
alexander
ægus
then
thirteen
years
old
in
whose
name
these
generals
had
each
governed
his
kingdom
with
unlimited
sway
and
who
was
then
of
an
age
that
the
soldiers
the
givers
of
all
power
were
already
planning
to
make
him
the
real
king
of
macedonia
and
of
his
wide
conquests
the
macedonian
phalanx
which
formed
the
pride
and
sinews
of
every
army
were
equally
held
by
their
loyalty
to
the
memory
of
alexander
whether
they
were
fighting
for
ptolemy
or
for
antigonus
and
equally
thought
that
they
were
guarding
a
province
for
his
heir
and
it
was
through
fear
of
loosening
their
hold
upon
the
faithfulness
of
these
their
best
troops
that
ptolemy
and
his
rivals
alike
chose
to
govern
their
kingdoms
under
the
unpretending
title
of
lieutenants
of
the
king
of
macedonia
hence
upon
the
death
of
alexander
ægus
there
was
a
throne
or
at
least
a
state
prison
left
empty
for
a
new
claimant
polysperchon
an
old
general
of
army
then
thought
that
he
saw
a
way
to
turn
cassander
out
of
macedonia
by
the
help
of
hercules
the
natural
son
of
alexander
by
barce
and
having
proclaimed
him
king
he
led
him
with
a
strong
army
against
cassander
but
polysperchon
wanted
either
courage
or
means
for
what
he
had
undertaken
and
he
soon
yielded
to
the
bribes
of
cassander
and
put
hercules
to
death
the
cities
on
the
southern
coast
of
asia
minor
yielded
to
antigonus
obedience
as
slight
as
the
ties
which
held
them
to
one
another
the
cities
of
pamphylia
and
cilicia
in
their
habits
as
in
their
situation
were
nearer
the
syrians
and
famous
for
their
shipping
they
all
enjoyed
a
full
share
of
the
trade
and
piracy
of
those
seas
and
were
a
tempting
prize
to
ptolemy
the
treaty
of
peace
between
the
generals
never
lessened
their
jealousy
nor
wholly
stopped
the
warfare
and
the
next
year
ptolemy
finding
that
his
troops
could
hardly
keep
their
possessions
in
cilicia
carried
over
an
army
in
person
to
attack
the
forces
of
antigonus
in
lycia
he
landed
at
phaselis
the
frontier
town
of
pamphylia
and
having
carried
that
by
storm
he
moved
westward
along
the
coast
of
lycia
he
made
himself
master
of
xanthus
the
capital
which
was
garrisoned
by
the
troops
of
antigonus
and
then
of
caunus
a
strong
place
on
the
coast
of
caria
with
two
citadels
one
of
which
he
gained
by
force
and
the
other
by
surrender
he
then
sailed
to
the
island
of
cos
which
he
gained
by
the
treachery
of
ptolemy
the
nephew
of
antigonus
who
held
it
for
his
uncle
but
who
went
over
to
the
egyptian
king
with
all
his
forces
by
this
success
he
gained
the
whole
southern
coast
of
asia
minor
the
brother
and
two
children
of
alexander
having
been
in
their
turns
as
we
have
seen
murdered
by
their
guardians
cleopatra
his
sister
and
thessalonica
his
niece
were
alone
left
alive
of
the
royal
family
of
macedonia
almost
every
one
of
the
generals
had
already
courted
a
marriage
with
cleopatra
which
had
either
been
refused
by
herself
or
hindered
by
his
rivals
and
lastly
ptolemy
now
that
by
the
death
of
her
nephews
she
brought
kingdoms
or
the
love
of
the
macedonian
mercenaries
which
was
worth
more
than
kingdoms
as
her
dower
sent
to
ask
her
hand
in
marriage
this
offer
was
accepted
by
cleopatra
but
on
her
journey
from
sardis
the
capital
of
lydia
to
egypt
on
her
way
to
join
her
future
husband
she
was
put
to
death
by
antigonus
the
niece
was
put
to
death
a
few
years
later
thus
every
one
who
was
of
the
family
of
alexander
paid
the
forfeit
of
life
for
that
honour
and
these
two
deaths
ended
the
macedonian
dynasty
with
a
double
tragedy
while
ptolemy
was
busy
in
helping
the
greek
cities
of
asia
to
gain
their
liberty
menelaus
his
brother
and
admiral
was
almost
driven
out
of
cyprus
by
demetrius
on
this
ptolemy
got
together
his
fleet
to
the
number
of
one
hundred
and
forty
long
galleys
and
two
hundred
transports
manned
with
not
less
than
ten
thousand
men
and
sailed
with
them
to
the
help
of
his
brother
this
fleet
under
the
command
of
menelaus
was
met
by
demetrius
with
the
fleet
of
antigonus
consisting
of
one
hundred
and
twelve
long
galleys
and
a
number
of
transports
and
the
egyptian
fleet
which
had
hitherto
been
master
of
the
sea
was
beaten
near
the
city
of
salamis
in
cyprus
by
the
smaller
fleet
of
demetrius
this
was
the
heaviest
loss
that
had
ever
befallen
ptolemy
eighty
long
galleys
were
sunk
and
forty
long
galleys
with
one
hundred
transports
and
eight
thousand
men
were
taken
prisoners
he
could
no
longer
hope
to
keep
cyprus
and
he
sailed
hastily
back
to
egypt
leaving
to
demetrius
the
garrisons
of
the
island
as
his
prisoners
all
of
whom
were
enrolled
in
the
army
of
antigonus
to
the
number
of
sixteen
thousand
foot
and
six
hundred
horse
this
naval
victory
gave
demetrius
the
means
of
unburdening
his
proud
mind
of
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
his
enemy
and
accordingly
remembering
what
ptolemy
had
done
after
the
battle
of
gaza
he
sent
back
to
egypt
unasked
for
and
unransomed
those
prisoners
who
were
of
high
rank
that
is
to
say
all
those
who
had
any
choice
about
which
side
they
fought
for
and
among
them
were
leontiscus
the
son
and
menelaus
the
brother
of
ptolemy
antigonus
was
overjoyed
with
the
news
of
his
victory
by
lessening
the
power
of
ptolemy
it
had
done
much
to
smooth
his
own
path
to
the
sovereignty
of
empire
which
was
then
left
without
an
heir
and
he
immediately
took
the
title
of
king
and
gave
the
same
title
to
his
son
demetrius
in
this
he
was
followed
by
ptolemy
and
the
other
generals
but
with
this
difference
that
while
antigonus
called
himself
king
of
all
the
provinces
ptolemy
called
himself
king
of
egypt
and
while
antigonus
gained
syria
and
cyprus
ptolemy
gained
the
friendship
of
every
other
kingdom
and
of
every
free
city
in
greece
they
all
looked
upon
him
as
their
best
ally
against
antigonus
the
common
enemy
the
next
year
antigonus
mustered
his
forces
in
and
got
ready
for
a
second
attack
upon
egypt
he
had
more
than
eighty
thousand
foot
accompanied
with
what
was
then
the
usual
proportion
of
cavalry
namely
eight
thousand
horse
and
elephants
demetrius
brought
with
him
from
cyprus
the
fleet
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
long
galleys
and
one
hundred
transports
laden
with
stores
and
engines
of
war
with
this
fleet
to
which
ptolemy
after
his
late
loss
had
no
ships
that
he
could
oppose
antigonus
had
no
need
to
ask
leave
of
the
arabs
of
the
little
city
of
petra
to
march
through
their
passes
but
he
led
his
army
straight
through
the
desert
to
pelusium
while
the
ships
of
burden
kept
close
to
the
shore
with
the
stores
the
pride
of
antigonus
would
not
let
him
follow
the
advice
of
the
sailors
and
wait
eight
days
till
the
north
winds
of
the
spring
equinox
had
passed
and
by
this
haste
many
of
his
ships
were
wrecked
on
the
coast
while
others
were
driven
into
the
nile
and
fell
into
the
hands
of
ptolemy
antigonus
himself
marching
with
the
land
forces
found
all
the
strong
places
well
guarded
by
the
egyptian
army
and
being
driven
back
at
every
point
discouraged
by
the
loss
of
his
ships
and
by
seeing
whole
bodies
of
his
troops
go
over
to
ptolemy
he
at
last
took
the
advice
of
his
officers
and
led
back
his
army
to
syria
while
ptolemy
returned
to
alexandria
to
employ
those
powers
of
mind
in
the
works
of
peace
which
he
had
so
successfully
used
in
his
various
wars
antigonus
then
turned
the
weight
of
his
mighty
kingdom
against
the
little
island
of
rhodes
which
though
in
sight
of
the
coast
of
asia
minor
held
itself
independent
of
him
and
in
close
friendship
with
ptolemy
the
dorian
island
of
rhodes
had
from
the
earliest
dawn
of
history
held
a
high
place
among
the
states
of
greece
and
in
all
the
arts
of
civilised
life
in
painting
sculpture
letters
and
commerce
it
had
been
lately
rising
in
rank
while
the
other
free
states
had
been
falling
its
maritime
laws
were
so
highly
thought
of
that
they
were
copied
by
most
other
states
and
being
afterwards
adopted
into
the
pandects
of
justinian
they
have
in
part
become
the
law
of
modern
europe
it
was
the
only
state
in
which
greek
liberty
then
kept
its
ground
against
the
great
empires
of
successors
against
this
little
state
demetrius
led
two
hundred
long
galleys
and
one
hundred
and
seventy
transports
with
more
than
forty
thousand
men
the
greek
world
looked
on
with
deep
interest
while
the
veterans
of
antigonus
were
again
and
again
driven
back
from
the
walls
of
the
blockaded
city
by
its
brave
and
virtuous
citizens
who
while
their
houses
were
burning
and
their
walls
crumbling
under
the
left
the
statues
of
antigonus
and
demetrius
standing
unhurt
in
the
saved
by
their
love
of
art
and
the
remembrance
of
former
kindness
which
with
a
true
greatness
of
mind
they
would
not
let
the
cruelties
of
the
siege
outweigh
the
galleys
of
ptolemy
though
unable
to
keep
at
sea
against
the
larger
fleet
of
demetrius
often
forced
their
way
into
the
harbour
with
the
welcome
supplies
of
grain
month
after
month
every
stratagem
and
machine
which
the
ingenuity
of
demetrius
could
invent
were
tried
and
failed
and
after
the
siege
had
lasted
more
than
a
year
he
was
glad
to
find
an
excuse
for
withdrawing
his
troops
and
the
rhodians
in
their
joy
hailed
ptolemy
with
the
title
of
soter
or
this
name
he
ever
afterwards
kept
though
by
the
greek
writers
he
is
more
often
called
ptolemy
the
son
of
lagus
if
we
search
the
history
of
the
world
for
a
second
instance
of
so
small
a
state
daring
to
withstand
the
armies
of
so
mighty
an
empire
we
shall
perhaps
not
find
any
one
more
remarkable
than
that
of
the
same
island
when
seventeen
hundred
years
afterwards
it
again
drew
upon
itself
the
eyes
of
the
world
while
it
beat
off
the
forces
of
the
ottoman
empire
under
mahomet
ii
and
standing
like
a
rock
in
front
of
christendom
it
rolled
back
for
years
the
tide
of
war
till
its
walls
were
at
last
crumbled
to
a
heap
of
ruins
by
suleiman
the
great
after
a
siege
of
many
months
the
next
of
conquests
was
and
soon
after
this
the
wars
between
these
successors
of
alexander
were
put
an
end
to
by
the
death
of
antigonus
whose
overtowering
ambition
was
among
the
chief
causes
of
quarrel
this
happened
at
the
great
battle
of
ipsus
in
phrygia
where
they
all
met
with
more
than
eighty
thousand
men
in
each
army
antigonus
king
of
asia
minor
was
accompanied
by
his
son
demetrius
and
by
pyrrhus
king
of
epirus
and
he
was
defeated
by
ptolemy
king
of
egypt
seleucus
king
of
babylon
lysimachus
king
of
thrace
and
cassander
king
of
macedonia
and
the
old
man
lost
his
life
fighting
bravely
after
the
battle
demetrius
fled
to
cyprus
and
yielded
to
the
terms
of
peace
which
were
imposed
on
him
by
the
four
allied
sovereigns
he
sent
his
friend
pyrrhus
as
a
hostage
to
alexandria
and
there
this
young
king
of
epirus
soon
gained
the
friendship
of
ptolemy
and
afterwards
his
stepdaughter
in
marriage
ptolemy
was
thus
left
master
of
the
whole
of
the
southern
coast
of
asia
minor
and
syria
indeed
of
the
whole
coast
of
the
eastern
end
of
the
mediterranean
from
the
island
of
cos
on
the
north
to
cyrene
on
the
south
during
these
formidable
wars
with
antigonus
ptolemy
had
never
been
troubled
with
any
serious
rising
of
the
conquered
egyptians
and
perhaps
the
wars
may
not
have
been
without
their
use
in
strengthening
his
throne
the
first
danger
to
a
successful
conqueror
is
from
the
avarice
and
disappointment
of
his
followers
who
usually
claim
the
kingdom
as
their
booty
and
who
think
themselves
wronged
and
their
past
services
forgotten
if
any
limit
is
placed
to
their
tyranny
over
the
conquered
but
these
foreign
wars
may
have
taught
the
alexandrians
that
ptolemy
was
not
strong
enough
to
the
egyptians
and
may
thus
have
saved
him
from
the
indiscretion
of
his
friends
and
from
their
reproaches
for
ingratitude
in
the
late
war
the
little
dorian
island
of
cos
on
the
coast
of
asia
minor
fell
as
we
have
seen
under
the
power
of
ptolemy
this
island
was
remarkable
as
being
the
first
spot
in
europe
into
which
the
manufacture
of
silk
was
introduced
which
it
probably
gained
when
under
the
power
of
persia
before
the
overthrow
of
darius
the
luxury
of
the
egyptian
ladies
who
affected
to
be
overheated
by
any
clothing
that
could
conceal
their
limbs
had
long
ago
introduced
a
tight
thin
dress
which
neither
our
climate
nor
notions
of
modesty
would
allow
and
for
this
dress
silk
when
it
could
be
obtained
was
much
valued
and
pamphila

cos
had
the
glory
of
having
woven
webs
so
transparent
that
the
egyptian
women
were
enabled
to
display
their
fair
forms
yet
more
openly
by
means
of
this

or
three
centuries

unknown

it
was
part
of
the
craft
to
endeavour
to
keep
each
branch
of
trade
to
themselves
by
concealing
the
channel
through
which
they
obtained
their
supply
of
goods

many
of
the
dresses
which
were
sold
in
rome
under
the
emperors
by
the
name

coan

have
been
brought
from
the
east
through
alexandria

of
the
most
valuable
gifts

egypt
owed
to

the
doubt

to
the
fineness
of
the

the
greek
merchants
who
crowded
the
markets
of
canopus

alexandria

have
filled
lower
egypt
with
the
coins
of
the
cities
from
whence
they
came
all
unlike
one
another
in
stamp
and
weight
but
while
every
little
city
or
even
colony
of
greece
had
its
own
coinage
egypt
had
as
yet
very
few
coins
of
its
own
we
are
even
doubtful
whether
we
know
by
sight
those
coined
by
the
persians
in
the
early
years
of
government
ptolemy
had
issued
a
very
few
coins
bearing
the
names
of
the
young
kings
in
whose
name
he
held
the
country
but
he
seems
not
to
have
coined
any
quantity
of
money
till
after
he
had
himself
taken
the
title
of
king
his
coins
are
of
gold
silver
and
bronze
and
are
in
a
fine
style
of
greek
workmanship
those
of
gold
and
silver
bear
on
one
side
the
portrait
of
the
king
without
a
beard
having
the
head
bound
with
the
royal
diadem
which
unlike
the
high
priestly
crown
of
the
native
egyptian
kings
or
the
modern
crown
of
gold
and
precious
stones
is
a
plain
riband
tied
in
a

the
other
side

have
the
name

ptolemy

egyptian
coinage
the
gold
coins
of
egypt
were
probably
made
in
alexandria
the
coins
are
not
of
the
same
weight
as
those
of
greece
but
ptolemy
followed
the
egyptian
standard
of
weight
which
was
that
to
which
the
jewish
shekel
was
adjusted
and
which
was
in
use

is
also
the
case
with
those
of

but
few
of
these
bronze
pieces
bear
any
marks
from
which
we
can
learn
the
reign
in
which
they
were

they

of
better

than
those
of

as
the
bronze
is
free
from
lead

more

the
historian
in
his
very
agreeable
labours
should
never
lose
sight
of
the
coins
they
teach
us
by
their
workmanship
the
state

the

and
by
their
weight

purity
of

the

also
teach

even
in
those
cases
where
they
seem
to
add
little
to
what
we
learn
from
other
sources
they
are
still
the
living
witnesses
to
which
we
appeal
to
prove
the
truth

the
authors

have
told

did

who
had
seen
them
to
surpass
any
that
had

had
quarrelled
with
ptolemy
who
had
known
him
well
when
he
was
the
friend
and
painter
of
alexander
once
when
he
was
at
alexandria
somebody
wickedly
told
him
that
he
was
invited
to
dine
at
the
royal
table
and
when
ptolemy
asked
who
it
was
that
had
sent
his
unwelcome
guest
apelles
drew
the
face
of
the
on
the
wall
and
he
was
known
to
all
the
court
by
the
likeness
it
was
perhaps
at
one
of
these
dinners
at
which
ptolemy
enjoyed
the
society
of
the
men
of
letters
or
perhaps
when
visiting
the
philosophers
in
their
schools
that
he
asked
euclid
if
he
could
not
show
him
a
shorter
and
easier
way
to
the
higher
truths
of
mathematics
than
that
by
which
he
led
the
pupils
in
the
museum
and
euclid
as
if
to
remind
him
of
the
royal
roads
of
persia
which
ran
by
the
side
of
the
highroads
but
were
kept
clear
and
free
for
the
own
use
made
him
the
answer
that
there
was
no
royal
road
to
geometry
ptolemy
lived
in
easy
familiarity
with
the
learned
men
of
alexandria
and
at
another
of
these
literary
dinners
when
diodorus
the
rhetorician
who
was
thought
to
have
been
the
inventor
of
the
dilemma
was
puzzled
by
a
question
put
to
him
by
stilpo
the
king
in
joke
said
that
his
name
should
be
cronus
a
god
who
had
been
laughed
at
in
the
comedies
indeed
he
was
so
teased
by
ptolemy
for
not
being
able
to
answer
it
that
he
got
up
and
left
the
room
he
afterwards
wrote
a
book
upon
the
subject
but
the
ridicule
was
said
to
have
embittered
the
rest
of
his
life
this
was
the
person
against
whom
callimachus
some
years
later
wrote
a
bitter
epigram
beginning
is
a
wise
diodorus
was
of
the
sceptical
school
of
philosophy
which
though
not
far
removed
from
the
cyrenaic
school
was
never
popular
in
alexandria
among
other
paradoxes
he
used
to
deny
the
existence
of
motion
he
argued
that
the
motion
was
not
in
the
place
where
the
body
moved
from
nor
in
the
place
that
the
body
moved
to
and
that
accordingly
it
did
not
exist
at
all
once
he
met
with
a
violent
fall
which
put
his
shoulder
out
of
joint
and
he
applied
to
herophilus
the
surgeon
to
set
it
herophilus
began
by
asking
him
where
the
fall
took
place
whether
in
the
place
where
the
shoulder
was
or
in
the
place
where
it
fell
to
but
the
smarting
philosopher
begged
him
to
begin
by
setting
his
limb
and
they
would
talk
about
the
existence
of
motion
after
the
operation
stilpo
was
at
this
time
only
on
a
visit
to
ptolemy
for
he
had
refused
his
offer
of
money
and
a
professorship
in
the
museum
and
had
chosen
to
remain
at
megara
where
he
was
the
ornament
of
his
birthplace
he
had
been
banished
from
athens
for
speaking
against
their
gods
and
for
saying
that
the
colossal
minerva
was
not
the
daughter
of
jupiter
but
of
phidias
the
sculptor
his
name
as
a
philosopher
stood
so
high
that
when
demetrius
in
his
late
wars
with
ptolemy
took
the
city
of
megara
by
storm
the
conqueror
bid
spare
the
house
of
stilpo
when
temple
and
tower
went
to
the
ground
and
when
demetrius
gave
orders
that
stilpo
should
be
repaid
for
what
he
had
lost
in
the
siege
the
philosopher
proudly
answered
that
he
had
lost
nothing
and
that
he
had
no
wealth
but
his
learning
the
historian
theopompus
of
chios
then
came
to
alexandria
and
wrote
an
account
of
the
wars
between
the
egyptians
and
the
persians
it
is
now
lost
but
it
contained
at
least
the
events
from
the
successful
invasion
by
artaxerxes
longimanus
till
the
unsuccessful
invasion
by
artaxerxes
mnemon
no
men
of
learning
in
alexandria
were
more
famous
than
the
physicians
erasistratus
of
cos
had
the
credit
of
having
once
cured
antiochus
afterwards
king
of
syria
he
was
the
grandson
of
aristotle
and
may
be
called
the
father
of
the
science
of
anatomy
his
writings
are
often
quoted
by
dioscorides
antiochus
in
his
youth
had
fallen
deeply
in
love
with
his
young
stepmother
and
was
pining
away
in
silence
and
despair
erasistratus
found
out
the
cause
of
his
illness
which
was
straightway
cured
by
seleucus
giving
up
his
wife
to
his
own
son
this
act
strongly
points
out
the
changed
opinions
of
the
world
as
to
the
matrimonial
relation
for
it
was
then
thought
the
best
title
to
the
name
of
nicator
he
had
before
conquered
his
enemies
but
he
then
conquered
himself
erasistratus
was
the
first
who
thought
that
a
knowledge
of
anatomy
should
be
made
a
part
of
the
healing
art
before
his
time
surgery
and
medicine
had
been
deemed
one
and
the
same
they
had
both
been
studied
by
the
slow
and
uncertain
steps
of
experience
unguided
by
theory
many
a
man
who
had
been
ill
whether
through
disease
or
wound
and
had
regained
his
health
thought
it
his
duty
to
esculapius
and
to
his
neighbours
to
write
up
in
the
temple
of
the
god
the
nature
of
his
ailings
and
the
simples
to
which
he
fancied
that
he
owed
his
cure
by
copying
these
loose
but
inscriptions
of
medical
cases
hippocrates
had
a
century
earlier
laid
the
foundations
of
the
science
but
nothing
further
was
added
to
it
till
erasistratus
setting
at
nought
the
prejudices
in
which
he
was
born
began
dissecting
the
human
body
in
the
schools
of
alexandria
there
the
mixing
together
of
greeks
and
egyptians
had
weakened
those
religious
feelings
of
respect
for
the
dead
which
are
usually
shocked
by
anatomy
and
this
study
flourished
from
the
low
tone
of
the
morality
as
much
as
from
the
encouragement
which
good
sense
should
grant
to
every
search
for
knowledge
herophilus
lived
about
the
same
time
with
erasistratus
and
was
like
him
famous
for
his
knowledge
of
the
anatomy
of
man
but
so
hateful
was
this
study
in
the
eyes
of
many
that
these
anatomists
were
charged
by
writers
who
ought
to
have
known
better
with
the
cruelty
of
cutting
men
open
when
alive
they
had
few
followers
in
the
hated
use
of
the
it
was
from
their
writings
that
galen
borrowed
the
anatomical
parts
of
his
work
and
thus
it
was
to
the
dissections
of
these
two
great
men
helped
indeed
by
opening
the
bodies
of
animals
that
the
world
owed
almost
the
whole
of
its
knowledge
of
the
anatomy
of
man
till
the
fifteenth
century
when
surgeons
were
again
bold
enough
to
face
the
outcry
of
the
mob
and
to
study
the
human
body
with
the
knife
hegesias
of
cyrene
was
an
early
lecturer
on
philosophy
at
alexandria
his
short
and
broken
sentences
are
laughed
at
by
cicero
yet
he
was
so
much
listened
to
when
lecturing
against
the
fear
of
death
and
showing
that
in
quitting
life
we
leave
behind
us
more
pains
than
pleasures
that
he
was
stopped
by
ptolemy
soter
through
fear
of
his
causing
among
his
hearers
he
then
wrote
a
book
upon
the
same
subject
for
though
the
state
watched
over
the
public
teaching
it
took
no
notice
of
books
writing
had
not
yet
become
the
mightiest
power
on
earth
the
miseries
however
of
this
world
which
he
so
eloquently
and
feelingly
described
in
his
lectures
and
writings
did
not
drive
him
to
put
an
end
to
his
own
life
philostephanus
of
cyrene
the
friend
of
callimachus
was
a
naturalist
who
wrote
upon
fishes
and
is
the
first
investigator
that
we
hear
of
who
thought
it
desirable
to
limit
his
studies
to
one
branch
of
the
science
of
natural
history
but
cyrene
did
not
send
all
its
great
men
to
alexandria
plato
had
studied
mathematics
there
under
theodorus
and
it
had
a
school
of
its
own
which
gave
its
name
to
the
cyrenaic
sect
the
founder
of
this
sect
was
aristippus
the
pupil
of
socrates
who
had
missed
the
high
honour
of
being
present
at
his
death
he
was
the
first
philosopher
who
took
money
from
his
pupils
and
used
to
say
that
they
valued
their
lessons
more
for
having
to
pay
for
them
but
he
was
blamed
by
his
brethren
for
thus
lowering
the
dignity
of
the
teacher
he
died
several
years
before
ptolemy
soter
came
into
egypt
the
cyrenaic
sect
thought
happiness
not
goodness
was
the
end
to
be
aimed
at
through
life
and
selfishness
rather
than
kindness
to
others
the
right
spring
of
actions
it
would
hardly
be
fair
to
take
their
opinions
from
the
mouths
of
their
enemies
and
the
dialogues
of
socrates
with
their
founder
as
told
to
us
by
would
prove
a
lower
tone
of
morality
than
he
is
likely
to
have
held
the
wish
for
happiness
and
the
philosophical
love
of
self
which
should
lead
to
goodness
though
a
far
worse
rule
of
life
than
the
love
of
goodness
for
its
own
sake
which
is
the
groundwork
of
religion
was
certainly
far
better
than
unguided
passion
and
the
love
of
pleasure
but
often
as
this
unsafe
rule
has
been
set
up
for
our
guidance
there
have
always
been
found
many
to
make
use
of
it
in
a
way
not
meant
by
the
teacher
the
cyrenaic
sect
soon
fell
into
the
disrepute
to
which
these
principles
were
likely
to
lead
it
and
wholly
ceased
when
epicurus
taught
the
same
opinions
more
philosophically
anniceris
of
cyrene
though
a
follower
of
aristippus
somewhat
improved
upon
the
philosophy
of
his
master
he
granted
that
there
were
many
things
worth
our
aim
which
could
not
be
brought
within
the
narrow
bounds
of
what
is
useful
he
did
not
overlook
friendship
kindness
honouring
our
parents
and
serving
our
country
and
he
thought
that
a
wise
man
would
undertake
many
labours
which
would
bring
him
no
return
in
the
things
which
were
alone
thought
happiness
the
chair
of
philosophy
at
cyrene
was
afterwards
filled
by
arete
the
daughter
of
aristippus
for
such
were
the
hindrances
in
the
way
of
gaining
knowledge
that
few
could
be
so
well
qualified
to
teach
as
the
daughter
books
were
costly
and
reading
by
no
means
a
cheap
amusement
she
was
followed
after
her
death
by
her
son
aristippus
who
having
been
brought
up
in
his
was
called
in
order
to
distinguish
him
from
his
grandfather
of
the
same
name
metrodidactus
or
history
has
not
told
us
whether
he
took
the
name
himself
in
gratitude
for
the
debt
which
he
owed
to
this
learned
lady
or
whether
it
was
given
him
by
his
pupils
but
in
either
case
it
was
a
sure
way
of
giving
to
the
mother
the
fame
which
was
due
to
her
for
the
education
of
her
son
for
no
one
could
fail
to
ask
who
was
the
mother
of
metrodidactus
theodorus
one
of
the
pupils
of
metrodidactus
though
at
one
time
banished
from
cyrene
rose
to
honour
under
soter
and
was
sent
by
him
as
ambassador
to
lysimachus
he
was
called
the
atheist
by
his
enemies
and
the
divine
by
his
friends
but
we
can
not
now
determine
which
title
he
best
deserved
it
was
then
usual
to
call
those
atheists
who
questioned
the
existence
of
the
pagan
gods
and
we
must
not
suppose
that
all
who
suffered
under
that
reproach
denied
that
the
world
was
governed
by
a
ruling
providence
the
disbeliever
in
the
false
religion
of
the
many

often
the
only
real
believer
in
a
god
theodorus
was
of
the
cold
school
of
philosophy
which
was
chiefly
followed
in
alexandria
it
was
earthly
lifeless
and
unpoetical
arising
from
the
successful
cultivation
of
the
physical
sciences
not
enough
counteracted
by
the
more
ennobling
pursuits
of
poetry
and
the
fine
arts
hence
while
commerce
and
the
arts
of
production
were
carried
to
higher
perfection
than
at
any
former
time
and
science
was
made
greatly
to
assist
in
the
supply
of
our
bodily
wants
the
arts
of
civilisation

by
no

neglected

cultivated
without

lofty
aim

any
true
knowledge

antiphilus
who
was
born
in

had
studied

to

showed
a
mean

accused
him
of
joining
in

plot
against
the
king
for
which
the
painter
narrowly
escaped
punishment
but
ptolemy
finding
that
the
charge
was
not
true
sent
apelles
a
gift
of
one
hundred
talents
to
make
amends
the
angry
feelings
of
apelles
were
by
no

cooled
by
this
gift

they
boiled

with

was
dragging
along

a

was
stretching
forth

to

calling
upon
the

to
bear
witness
that

ptolemy
soter
was
plain
in
his
manners
and
scarcely
surpassed
his
own
generals
in
the
costliness
of
his
way
of
life
he
often
dined
and
slept
at
the
houses
of
his
friends
and
his
own
house
had
so
little
of
the
palace
that
he
borrowed
dishes
and
tables
of
his
friends
when
he
asked
any
number
of
them
to
dine
with
him
in
return
saying
that
it
was
the
part
of
a
king
to
enrich
others
rather
than
to
be
rich
himself
before
he
took
the
title
of
king
he
styled
himself
and
was
styled
by
friendly
states
by
the
simple
name
of
ptolemy
the
macedonian
and
during
the
whole
of
his
reign
he
was
as
far
from
being
overbearing
in
his
behaviour
as
from
being
kinglike
in
his
dress
and
household
once
when
he
wished
to
laugh
at
a
boasting
antiquary
he
asked
him
what
he
knew
could
not
be
answered
who
was
the
father
of
peleus
and
the
other
let
his
wit
so
far
get
the
better
of
his
prudence
as
in
return
to
ask
the
king
who
had
perhaps
never
heard
the
name
of
his
own
grandfather
if
he
knew
who
was
the
father
of
lagus
but
ptolemy
took
no
further
notice
of
this
than
to
remark
that
if
a
king
can
not
bear
rude
answers
he
ought
not
to
ask
rude
questions
an
answer
which
ptolemy
once
made
to
a
soothsayer
might
almost
be
taken
as
the
proverb
which
had
guided
him
through
life
when
his
soldiers
met
with
an
anchor
in
one
of
their
marches
and
were
disheartened
on
being
told
by
the
soothsayer
that
it
was
a
proof
that
they
ought
to
stop
where
they
then
were
the
king
restored
their
courage
by
remarking
that
an
anchor
was
an
omen
of
safety
not
of
delay

afterwards

after

he
then
married
eurydice
the
daughter
of
antipater
by
whom
he
had
several
children
the
eldest
son
ptolemy
was
named
ceraunus
and
was
banished
by
his
father
from
alexandria
in
his
distress
he
fled
to
seleucus
by
whom
he
was
kindly
received
but
after
the
death
of
ptolemy
soter
he
basely
plotted
against
seleucus
and
put
him
to
death
he
then
defeated
in
battle
antigonus
the
son
of
demetrius
and
got
possession
of
macedonia
for
a
short
time
he
married
his
arsinoë
and
put
her
children
to
death
and
was
soon
afterwards
put
to
death
himself
by
the
gauls
who
were
either
fighting
against
him
or
were
mercenaries
in
his
own
army
another
son
of
ptolemy

eurydice
was
put
to
death
by
ptolemy
philadelphus
for
plotting
against
his
throne
to
which
as
the
elder
brother
he
might
have
thought
himself
the
best
entitled
their
daughter
lysander
married
agathocles
the
son
of
lysimachus
but
when
agathocles
was
put
to
death
by
his
father
she
fled
to
egypt
with
her
children
and
put
herself
under
care
ptolemy
then
as
we
have
seen
asked
in
marriage
the
hand
of
cleopatra
the
sister
of
alexander
but
on
her
death
he
married
berenicê
a
lady
who
had
come
into
egypt
with
eurydice
and
had
formed
part
of
her
household
she
was
the
widow
of
a
man
named
philip
and
she
had
by
her
first
husband
a
son
named
magas
whom
ptolemy
made
governor
of
cyrene
and
a
daughter
antigone
whom
ptolemy
gave
in
marriage
to
pyrrhus

that
young
king
was
living
in
alexandria
as
hostage
for
demetrius
mildness
and
goodness
of
heart

useful
in
softening
her
severity
once
when
ptolemy
was
unbending
his
mind
at
a
game
of
dice
with
her
one
of
his
officers
came
up
to
his
side
and
began
to
read
over
to
him
a
list
of
criminals
who
had
been
condemned
to
death
with
their
crimes
and
to
ask
his
pleasure
on
each
illustration
berenice
soter
ptolemy
continued
playing
and
gave
very
little
attention
to
the
unhappy
tale
but
feelings
overcame
the
softness
of
her
character
and
she
took
the
paper
out
of
the
hand
and
would
not
let
him
finish
reading
it
saying
it
was
very
unbecoming
in
the
king
to
treat
the
matter
so
lightly
as
if
he
thought
no
more
of
the
loss
of
a
life
than
the
loss
of
a
throw
with
berenicê
ptolemy
spent
the
rest
of
his
years
without
anything
to
trouble
the
happiness
of
his
family
he
saw
their
elder
son
ptolemy
whom
we
must
call
by
the
name
which
he
took
late
in
life
philadelphus
grow
up
everything
that
he
could
wish
him
to
be
and
moved
alike
by
his
love
for
the
mother
and
by
the
good
qualities
of
the
son
he
chose
him
as
his
successor
on
the
throne
instead
of
his
eldest
son
ptolemy
ceraunus
who
had
shown
by
every
act
in
his
life
his
unfitness
for
the
royal
position
his
daughter
arsinoë
married
lysimachus
in
his
old
age
and
urged
him
against
his
son
agathocles
the
husband
of
her
own
sister
she
afterwards
married
her
ptolemy
ceraunus
and
lastly
became
the
wife
of
her
brother
philadelphus
argzeus
the
youngest
son
of
ptolemy
was
put
to
death
by
philadelphus
on
a
charge
of
treason
of
his
youngest
daughter
philotera
we
know
nothing
except
that
her
brother
philadelphus
afterwards
named
a
city
on
the
coast
of
the
red
sea
after
her
after
the
last
battle
with
demetrius
ptolemy
had
regained
the
island
of
cyprus
and
including
judæa
and
his
throne
became
stronger
as
his
life
drew
to
an
end
with
a
wisdom
rare
in
kings
and
conquerors
he
had
never
let
his
ambition
pass
his
means
he
never
aimed
at
universal
power
and
he
was
led
both
by
his
kind
feelings
and
wise
policy
to
befriend
all
those
states
which
like
his
own
were
threatened
by
that
mad
ambition
in
others
his
history
of
wars
is
lost
and
we
therefore
can
not
judge
of
his
merits
as
an
author
but
we
may
still
point
out
with
pleasure
how
much
his
people
gained
from
his
love
of
letters
though
indeed
we
do
not
need
the
example
of
ptolemy
to
show
that
learning
and
philosophy
are
as
much
in
place
and
find
as
wide
a
field
of
usefulness
in
governing
a
kingdom
as
in
the
employments
of
the
teacher
the
lawyer
or
the
physician
who
so
often
claim
them
as
their
own
his
last
public
act
in
the
year
of
his
reign
was
ordered
by
the
same
forbearance
which
had
governed
every
part
of
his
life
feeling
the
weight
of
years
press
heavily
upon
him
that
he
was
less
able
than
formerly
to
bear
the
duties
of
his
office
and
wishing
to
see
his
son
firmly
seated
on
the
throne
he
laid
aside
his
diadem
and
his
title
and
without
consulting
either
the
army
or
the
capital
proclaimed
ptolemy
his
son
by
berenicê
king
and
contented
himself
with
the
modest
rank
of
somatophylax
or
satrap
to
his
successor
he
had
used
his
power
so
justly
that
he
was
not
afraid
to
lay
it
down
and
he
has
taught
us
how
little
of
true
greatness
there
is
in
rank
by
showing
how
much
more
there
is
in
resigning
it
this
is
perhaps
the
most
successful
instance
known
of
a
king
who
had
been
used
to
be
obeyed
by
armies
and
by
nations
willingly
giving
up
his
power
when
he
found
his
bodily
strength
no
longer
equal
to
it
ptolemy
soter
had
the
happiness
of
having
a
son
willing
to
follow
in
the
track
which
he
had
laid
down
for
him
and
of
living
to
see
the
wisdom
of
his
own
laws
proved
by
the
of
the
kingdom
under
his
son
and
successor
but
while
we
are
watching
the
success
of
plans
and
the
rise
of
this
greek
monarchy
at
alexandria
we
can
not
help
being
pained
with
the
thought
that
the
kopts
of
upper
egypt
are
forgotten
and
asking
whether
it
would
not
have
been
still
better
to
have
raised
thebes
to
the
place
which
it
once
held
and
to
have
recalled
the
days
of
ramses
instead
of
trying
what
might
seem
the
hopeless
task
of
planting
greek
arts
in
africa
but
a
review
of
this
history
will
show
that
as
far
as
human
forethought
can
judge
this
could
not
have
been
done
a
people
whose
religious
opinions
were
fixed
against
all
change
like
the
pillars
upon
which
they
were
carved
and
whose
philosophy
had
not
noticed
that
minds
were
made
to
move
forward
had
no
choice
but
to
be
left
behind
and
trampled
on
as
their
more
active
neighbours
marched
onwards
in
the
path
of
improvement
if
thebes
had
fallen
only
on
the
conquest
by
cambyses
if
the
rebellions
against
the
persians
had
been
those
of
kopts
throwing
off
their
chains
and
struggling
for
freedom
we
might
have
hoped
to
have
seen
egypt
on
the
fall
of
darius
again
rise
under
kings
of
the
blood
and
language
of
the
people
and
we
should
have
thought
the
gilded
and
chains
of
the
ptolemies
were
little
better
than
the
heavy
yoke
of
the
persians
this
however
is
very
far
from
having
been
the
case
we
first
see
the
kings
of
lower
egypt
guarding
their
thrones
at
saïs
by
greek
soldiers
and
then
that
every
struggle
of
inarus
of
nectanebo
and
of
tachos
against
the
persians
was
only
made
by
the
courage
and
arms
of
greeks
hired
in
the
delta
by
egyptian
gold
during
the
three
hundred
years
before
alexander
was
hailed
by
egypt
as
its
deliverer
scarcely
once
had
the
kopts
trusting
to
their
own
courage
stood
up
in
arms
against
either
persians
or
greeks
and
the
country
was
only
then
without
a
battle
because
the
power
and
arms
were
already
in
the
hands
of
the
greeks
because
in
the
mixed
races
of
the
delta
the
greeks
were
so
far
the
strongest
though
not
the
most
numerous
that
a
greek
kingdom
rose
there
with
the
same
ease
and
for
the
same
reasons
that
an
arab
kingdom
rose
in
the
same
place
nine
centuries
later

ptolemy

we
know
of
few
princes
who
ever
mounted
a
throne
with
such
fair
prospects
before
them
as
the
second
ptolemy
he
was
born
in
cos
an
island
on
the
coast
of
caria
which
the
ptolemies
kept
as
a
family
fortress
safe
from
egyptian
rebellion
and
alexandrian
rudeness
and
while
their
fleets
were
masters
of
the
sea
safe
from
foreign
armies
he
had
been
brought
up
with
great
care
and
being
a
younger
son
was
not
spoilt
by
that
flattery
which
in
all
courts
is
so
freely
offered
to
the
heir
he
first
studied
letters
and
philosophy
under
philetas
of

an
author
of
some
elegies
and
epigrams
now
lost
and
as
he
grew
up
he
found
himself
surrounded
by
all
the
philosophers
and
writers
with
whom
his
father
mixed
on
the
easiest
terms
of
friendship
during
the
long
reign
of
ptolemy

people
had
been
made
happy

was

that
the
prince
then
mounting

even
if

slightly

with
virtues
would
give
his
name
to
a
reign
which
could
not

otherwise
than
remarkable
in

philadelphus
though
like
his
father
he
was
not
free
from
the
vices
of
his
times
and
of
his
rank
had
more
of
wisdom
than
is
usually
the
lot
of
kings

we
can
not

see
that
he
was

gathering
the
fruit
where
his

had
planted

we
must
at
the

time
acknowledge
that
philadelphus
was
a
successor
worthy
of
ptolemy

he
may
have
been
in
the
year
of
his
age
when
his

gave
up
to
him
the
cares

of
royalty

first
act
of
his
reign

rather
the
last
of
his

proclamation

showing
the

the

was

that
was
costly

all
that
the
wealth
of
egypt
could
buy
or
the
gratitude
of
the
provinces
could
give
was
brought
forth
to
grace
this
religious
show
which
as
we
learn
from
the
sculptures
in
the
old
tombs
was
copied
rather
from

of

who

travelling
in

and
who
wrote
a
history
of
alexandria
ptolemy
soter
lived
two
years
after
he
had
withdrawn
himself
from
the
cares
of
government
and
the
weight
of
his
name
was
not
without
its
use
in
adding
steadiness
to
the
throne
of
his
successor
instead
of
parcelling
out
his
wide
provinces
among
his
sons
as
so
many
kingdoms
he
had
given
them
all
to
one
son
and
that
not
the
eldest
and
on
his
death
the
jealousy
of
those
who
had
been
disinherited
and
disappointed
broke
out
in
rebellion
it
is
with
peculiar
interest
that
we
hear
in
this
reign
for
the
first
time
that
the
bravery
and
rising
power
of
the
romans
had
forced
themselves
into
the
notice
of
philadelphus
pyrrhus
the
king
of
epirus
had
been
beaten
by
the
romans
and
driven
out
of
italy
and
the
king
of
egypt
thought
it
not
beneath
him
to
send
an
ambassador
to
the
senate
to
wish
them
joy
of
their
success
and
to
make
a
treaty
of
peace
with
the
republic
the
embassy
as
we
might
suppose
was
received
in
rome
with
great
joy
and
three
ambassadors
two
of
the
proud
name
of
fabius
with
quintus
ogulnius
were
sent
back
to
seal
the
treaty
philadelphus
gave
them
some
costly
gifts
probably
those
usually
given
to
ambassadors
but
rome
was
then
young
her
citizens
had
not
yet
made
gold
the
end
for
which
they
lived
and
the
ambassadors
returned
the
gifts
for
they
could
receive
nothing
beyond
the
thanks
of
the
senate
for
having
done
their
duty
this
treaty
was
never
broken
and
in
the
war
which
broke
out
in
the
middle
of
this
reign
between
rome
and
carthage
usually
called
the
first
punic
war
when
the
carthaginians
sent
to
alexandria
to
beg
for
a
loan
of
two
thousand
talents
philadelphus
refused
it
saying
that
he
would
help
them
against
his
enemies
but
not
against
his
friends
from
that
time
forward
we
find
egypt
in
alliance
with
rome
but
we
also
find
that
they
were
day
by
day
changing
place
with
one
another
egypt
soon
began
to
sink
while
rome
was
rising
in
power
egypt
soon
received
help
from
her
stronger
ally
and
at
last
became
a
province
of
the
roman
empire
at
the
time
of
this
embassy
when
greek
arts
were
nearly
unknown
to
the
romans
the
ambassadors
must
have
seen
much
that
was
new
to
them
and
much
that
was
worth
copying
and
three
years
afterwards
when
one
of
them
quintus

one
of
the
chief
troubles
in
the
reign
of
philadelphus
was
the
revolt
of
cyrene
the
government
of
that
part
of
africa
had
been
entrusted
to
magas
the
of
the
king
a
son
of
berenice
by
her
former
husband
berenice

had
been
successful
in
setting
aside
ceraunus
to
make
room
for
her
son
philadelphus

even
been
said
to
have
favoured
the
rebellious
and
ungrateful
efforts
of
her
elder
son
magas
to
make
himself
king
of
cyrene
magas
without
waiting
till
the
large
armies
of
egypt
were
drawn
together
to
crush
his
little
state
marched
hastily
towards
alexandria
in
the
hopes
of
being
joined
by
some
of
the
restless
thousands
of
that
crowded
city
but
he
was
quickly
recalled
to
cyrene
by
the
news
of
the
rising
of
the
marmaridas
the
race
of
libyan
herdsmen
that
had
been
driven
back
from
the
coast
by
the
greek
settlers
who
founded
cyrene
philadelphus
then
led
his
army
along
the
coast
against
the
rebels
but
he
was
in
the
same
way
stopped
by
the
fear
of
treachery
among
his
own
gallic
mercenaries
with
a
measured
cruelty
which
the
use
of
foreign
mercenaries
could
alone
have
taught
him
he
led
back
his
army
to
the
marshes
of
the
delta
and
entrapping
the
four
thousand
distrusted
on
one
of
the
small
islands
he
hemmed
them
in
between
the
water
and
the
spears
of
the
phalanx
and
they
all
died
miserably
by
famine
by
drowning
or
by
the
sword
it
is
not
known
for
certain
from
what
part
of
the
world
these
gauls
were
recruited
the
race
known
as
gallic
was
at
one
time
spread
over
a
wide
district
from
gallicia
in
the
east
to
gallia
in
the
west
magas
had
married
apime
the
daughter
of
antiochus
soter
king
of
syria
and
he
sent
to
his
to
beg
him
to
march
upon
and
palestine
to
call
off
the
army
of
philadelphus
from
cyrene
but
philadelphus
did
not
wait
for
this
attack
his
armies
moved
before
antiochus
was
ready
and
by
a
successful
inroad
upon
syria
he
prevented
any
relief
being
sent
to
magas
after
the
war
between
the
brothers
had
lasted
some
years
magas
made
an
offer
of
peace
which
was
to
be
sealed
by
betrothing
his
only
child
berenicê
to
the
son
of
philadelphus
to
this
offer
philadelphus
yielded
as
by
the
death
of
magas
who
was
already
worn
out
by
luxury
and
disease
cyrene
would
then
fall
to
his
own
son
magas
indeed
died
before
the
marriage
took
place
but
notwithstanding
the
efforts
made
by
his
widow
to
break
the
agreement
the
treaty
was
kept
and
on
this
marriage
cyrene
again
formed
part
of
the
ptolemaic
kingdom
of
egypt
the
black
spot
upon
the
character
of
philadelphus
which
all
the
blaze
of
science
and
letters
by
which
he
was
surrounded
can
not
make
us
overlook
is
the
death
of
two
of
his
brothers
a
son
of
eurydice
who
might
perhaps
have
thought
that
he
was
robbed
of
the
throne
of
egypt
by
his
younger
brother
and
who
was
unsuccessful
in
raising
the
island
of
cyprus
in
rebellion
and
a
younger
brother
argasus
who
was
also
charged
with
joining
in
a
plot
both
lost
their
lives
by
his
orders
it
was
only
in
the
beginning
of
this
reign
after
egypt
had
been
for
more
than
fifty
years
under
the
rule
of
the
macedonians
that
the
evils
which
often
follow
conquest
were
brought
to
an
end
before
this
reign
no
greek
was
ever
known
to
have
reached
elephantine
and
syênê
or
aswan
since
herodotus
made
his
hasty
tour
in
the
thebaid
and
during
much
of
the
last
reign
no
part
of
upper
egypt
was
safe
for
a
greek
traveller
if
he
were
alone
or
if
he
quitted
the
highroad
the
peasants
whose
feelings
of
hatred
we
can
hardly
wonder
at
waylaid
the
stragglers
and
as
the
greeks
said
or
as
it
would
be
wiser
to
say
often
put
them
to
death
in
cold
blood
but
a
long
course
of
good
government
had
at
last
quieted
the
whole
country
and
left
room
for
further
improvements
by
philadelphus
among
other
buildings
philadelphus
raised
a
temple
in
alexandria
to
the
honour
of
his
father
and
mother
and
placed
in
it
their
statues
made
of
ivory
and
gold
and
ordered
that
they
should
be
worshipped
like
the
gods
and
other
kings
of
the
country
he
also
built
a
temple
to
ceres
and
proserpine
and
then
the
eleusinian
mysteries
were
taught
in
alexandria
to
the
few
who
were
willing
and
worthy
to
be
admitted
the
southeast
quarter
of
the
city
in
which
this
temple
stood
was
called
the
eleusinis
and
here
the
troop
of
maidens
were
to
be
seen
carrying
the
sacred
basket
through
the
streets
and
singing
hymns
in
honour
of
the
goddess
while
they
charged
all
profane
persons
who
met
the
procession
to
keep
their
eyes
upon
the
ground
lest
they
should
see
the
basket
and
the
priestesses
who
were
too
pure
for
them
to
look
upon

this
reign

the
lighthouse
on
the
island
of
pharos

the
red
sea

which
the
wind
blows

north

nine
months
in
the
year

found
so
dangerous
by
the
little
vessels
from
the
south
of
arabia
that
they
always
chose
the
most
southerly
port
in
which
they
could
meet

egyptian
buyers
the
merchants

their
bales

through
the
desert

the
path
is
marked
only
by
the
skeletons
of
the
animals
that
have
died
upon
the
route
less
costly
than
a
coasting
voyage
hence
when
philadelphus
had
made
the
whole
of
upper
egypt
to
the
cataracts
at
aswan
syênê
as
quiet
and
safe
as
the
delta
he
made
a
new
port
on
the
rocky
coast
of
the
red
sea
nearly
two
hundred
miles
to
the
south
of
cosseir
and
named
it
berenicê
after
his
mother
he
also
built
four
public
inns
or
where
the
caravans
might
find
water
for
the
camels
and
shelter
from
the
noonday
sun
on
their
twelve
journey
through
the
desert
from
koptos
on
the
nile
to
this
new
port
he
rebuilt
and
at
the
same
time
renamed
the
old
port
of
cosseir
or
ænnum
as
it
was
before
called
and
named
it
philotera
after
his
younger
sister
the
trade
which
thus
passed
down
the
nile
from
syênê
from
berenicê
and
from
philotera
paid
a
toll
or
duty
at
the
station
of
phylake
a
little
below
lycopolis
on
the
west
bank
of
the
river
where
a
guard
of
soldiers
was
encamped
and
this
station
gradually
grew
into
a
town
illustration
rosetta
branch
of
the
nile
philadelphus
also
built
a
city
on
the
sands
at
the
head
of
the
red
sea
near
where
suez
now
stands
and
named
it
arsinoë
after
his
sister
and
he
again
opened
the
canal
which
necho
ii
and
darius
had
begun
by
which
ships
were
to
pass
from
the
nile
to
this
city
on
the
red
sea
this
canal
began
in
the
pelusiac
branch
of
the
river
a
little
above
bubastis
and
was
carried
to
the
lower
bitter
lakes
in
the
reign
of
darius
from
thence
philadelphus
wished
to
carry
it
forward
to
the
red
sea
near
the
town
of
arsinoë
and
moreover
cleared
it
from
the
sands
which
soon
overwhelmed
it
and
choked
it
up
whenever
it
was
neglected
by
the
government
but
his
undertaking
was
stopped
by
the
engineers
finding
the
waters
of
the
canal
several
feet
lower
than
the
level
of
the
red
sea
and
that
if
finished
it
would
become
a
canal
which
could
neither
water
the
fields
nor
give
drink
to
the
cities
in
the
valley
he
also
built
a
second
city
of
the
name
of
berenicê
called
the
berenicê
epidires
at
the
very
mouth
of
the
red
sea
on
a
point
of
land
where
abyssinia
is
hardly
more
than
fifteen
miles
from
the
opposite
coast
of
arabia
this
naming
of
cities
after
his
mother
and
sisters
was
no
idle
compliment
they
probably
received
the
crown
revenues
of
those
cities
for
their
personal
maintenance
with
a
view
further
to
increase
the
trade
with
the
east
philadelphus
sent
dionysius
on
an
expedition
overland
to
india
to
gain
a
knowledge
of
the
country
and
of
its
means
and
wants
he
went
by
the
way
of
the
caspian

through
bactria
in

he
dwelt
there
at

court
of

sovereign
soon
after
the
time
that
megasthenes
was
there
and
he
wrote
a
report
of
what
he
saw
and
learned
but
it
is
sad
to
find
in
our
search
for
what
is
valuable
in
the
history
of
past
times
that
the
information
gained
on
this
interesting
journey
of
discovery
is
wholly
lost
in
the
number
of
ports
which
were
then
growing
into
the
rank
of
cities
we
see
full
proof
of
the
great
trade
of
egypt
at
that
time
and
we
may
form
some
opinion
of
the
profit
which
was
gained
from
the
trade
of
the
red
sea
from
the
report
of
clitarchus
to
alexander
that
the
people
of
one
of
the
islands
would
give
a
talent
of
gold
for
a
horse
so
plentiful
with
them
was
gold

so
scarce
the
useful
animals
of
europe
and
one
of
the
three
towns
named
after
the
late
queen
on
that
coast
was
known
by
the
name
of
the
nubian
or
golden
berenicê

large
supply
of
gold

was
dug
from

the
new
city

however
was
little
more
than
a
post
from
which
the
hunting
parties
went
out
to
catch
elephants
for
the
armies
of
egypt
philadelphus
tried
to
command
to
persuade
and
to
bribe
the
neighbouring
tribes
not
to
kill
these
elephants
for
food
but
they
refused
all

him
these
zealous
huntsmen
answered
that
if

offered
them
the

all
its
wealth
they
would
not
give
up

pleasure
of
catching

were
able
to
supply
the

the

its

are

held
at

the

schools

for

medicine
the
four
branches
into
which
it
was
divided

library
soon
held
two
hundred
thousand
rolls
of
papyrus
which
however
could
hardly
have
been
equal
to
ten
thousand
printed
volumes
many
of
these
were
bought
by
philadelphus
in
athens
and
rhodes
and
his
copy
of
works
was
bought
of
the
philosopher
nileus
who
had
been
a
hearer
of
that
great
man
and
afterwards
inherited
his
books
through
theophrastus
to
whom
they
had
been
left
by

the
books
in

were
of
course
all

did
not
study
foreign

who
after
ruling
athens
with
great
praise
was
banished
from
his
country
and
fled
to
ptolemy
soter
under
whom
he
consoled
himself
for
the
loss
of
power
in
the
enjoyment
of
literary
leisure
he
was
at
the
same
time
the
most
learned
and
the
most
polished
of
orators
he
brought
learning
from
the
closet
into
the

turn
which
he
gave
to

thought
him
the
great
master
in
the
art
of
speaking
and
seems
to
have
taken
him
as
the
model
upon
which
he
wished
to
form
his
own
style
he
wrote
upon
philosophy
history
government
and
poetry
but
the
only
one
of
his
works
which
has
reached
our
time
is
his
treatise
on
elocution
and
the
careful
thought
which
he
there
gives
to
the
choice
of
words
and
to
the
form
of
a
sentence
and
even
the
parts
of
a
sentence
shows
the
value
then
set
upon
style
indeed
he
seems
rather
to
have
charmed
his
hearers
by
the
softness
of
his
words
than
to
have
roused
them
to
noble
deeds
by
the
strength
of
his
thoughts
he
not
only
advised
ptolemy
soter
what
books
he
should
buy
but
which
he
should
read
and
he
chiefly
recommended
those
on
government
and
policy
and
it
is
alike
to
the
credit
of
the
king
and
of
the
librarian
that
he
put
before
him
books
which
from
their
praise
of
freedom
and
hatred
of
tyrants
few
persons
would
even
speak
of
in
the
presence
of
a
king
but
demetrius
had
also
been
consulted
by
soter
about
the
choice
of
a
successor
and
had
given
his
opinion
that
the
crown
ought
to
be
left
to
his
eldest
son
and
that
wars
would
arise
between
his
children
if
it
were
not
so
left

we
can
hardly
wonder
that
on
the
death
of
soter
demetrius
should
have
lost
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
museum
and

say
in

the
education
of
his
children
he
is
also
known
as
the
first
of
those
alexandrian
critics
who
turned
their
thoughts
towards
mending
the
text
of
homer
and
to
whom
we
are
indebted
for
the
tolerably
correct
state
of
the
great
works
which
had
become
faulty
through
the
carelessness
of
the
copiers
zenodotus
was
soon
followed
by
other
critics
in
this
task
of
editing
homer
but
their
labours
were
not
approved
of
by
all
and
when
aratus
asked
timon
which
he
thought
the
best
edition
of
the
poet
the
philosopher
shrewdly
answered
which
has
been
least
at
the
head
of
the
mathematical
school
was
euclid
who
is
however
less
known
to
us
by
what
his
pupils
have
said
of
him
than
by
his
own
invaluable
work
on
geometry
this
is
one
of
the
few
of
the
scientific
writings
of
the
ancients
that
are
still
in
use
the
discoveries
of
the
man
of
science
are
made
use
of
by
his
successor
and
the
discoverer
perhaps
loses
part
of
his
reward
when
his
writings
are
passed
by
after
they
have
served
us
as
a
to
mount
by
if
he
wishes
his
works
to
live
with
those
of
the
poet
and
orator
he
must
like
them
cultivate
those
beauties
of
style
which
are
fitted
to
his
matter
euclid
did
so
and
his
elements
have
been
for
more
than
two
thousand
years
the
model
for
all
writers
on
geometry
he
begins
at
the
beginning
and
leads
the
learner
step
by
step
from
the
simplest
propositions
called
axioms
which
rest
upon
metaphysical
rather
than
mathematical
proof
to
high
geometrical
truths
the
mind
is
indeed
sometimes
wearied
by
being
made
to
stop
at
every
single
step
in
the
path
and
wishes
with
ptolemy
soter
for
a
shorter
road
but
upon
the
whole
clearness
has
never
been
equalled
ctesibus
wrote
on
the
theory
of
hydrostatics
and
was
the
inventor
of

application
of
mathematics
which
was
much
called
for
by
the
artificial
irrigation
of

among
the
best
known
of
the
men
of
letters
who
came
to
alexandria
to
enjoy
the
patronage
of
philadelphus
was
theocritus
many
of
his
poems
are
lost
but
his
pastoral
poems
though
too
rough
for
the
polished
taste
of
quintilian
and
perhaps
more
like
nature
than
we
wish
any
works
of
imitative
art
to
be
have
always
been
looked
upon
as
the
model
of
that
kind
of
poetry
if
his
shepherds
do
not
speak
the
language
of
courtiers
they
have
at
least
a
rustic
propriety
which
makes
us
admire
the
manners
and
thoughts
of
the
peasant
he
repaid
the
bounty
of
the
king
in
the
way
most
agreeable
to
him
he
speaks
of
him
as
one
to
freemen
kind
wise
fond
of
books
and
love
of
generous
mind
knows
well
his
friend
but
better
knows

foe

wealth

asked
he
says
no
but

xiv
theocritus
boasted
that
he
would
in
an
undying
poem
place
him
in
the
rank
of
the
demigods
and
writing
with
the
pyramids
and
the
memnonium
before
his
eyes
assured
him
that
generosity
towards
the
poets
would
do
more
to
make
his
name
live
for
ever
than
any
building
that
he
could
raise
in
a
back
street
of
alexandria
in
the
part
of
the
city
named
eleusinis
near
the
temple
of
ceres
and
proserpine
lived
the
poet
callimachus
earning
his
livelihood
by
teaching
but
the
writer
of
the
hymns
could
not
long
dwell
so
near
the
court
of
philadelphus
unknown
and
unhonoured
he
was
made
professor
of
poetry
in
the
museum
and
even
now
repays
the
king
and
patron
for
what
he
then
received
he
was
a
man
of
great
industry
and
wrote
in
prose
and
in
all
kinds
of
verse
but
of
these
only
a
few
hymns
and
epigrams
have
come
down
to
our
time
egypt
seems
to
have
been
the
birthplace
of
the
mournful
elegy
and
callimachus
was
the
chief
of
the
elegiac
poets
he
was
born
at
cyrene
and
though
from
the
language
in
which
he
wrote
his
thoughts
are
mostly
greek
yet
he
did
not
forget
the
place
of
his
birth
he
calls
upon
apollo
by
the
name
of
carneus
because
after
sparta
and
thera
cyrene
was
his
chosen
seat
he
paints
latona
weary
and
in
pain
in
the
island
of
delos
as
leaning
against
a
by
the
side
of
the
river
inopus
which
sinking
into
the
ground
was
to
rise
again
in
egypt
near
the
cataracts
of
syênê
and
prettily
pointing
to
philadelphus
he
makes
apollo
yet
unborn
ask
his
mother
not
to
give
birth
to
him
in
the
island
of
cos
because
that
island
was
already
chosen
as
the
birthplace
of
another
god
the
child
of
the
gods
soteres
who
would
be
the
copy
of
his
father
and
under
whose
diadem
both
egypt
and
the
islands
would
be
proud
to
be
governed
by
a
macedonian
illustration
the
cararact
on
the
aswan
the
poet
philastas
who
had
been
the
first
tutor
of
philadelphus
was
in
elegy
second
only
to
callimachus
but
quintilian
while
advising
us
about
books
to
read
much
but
not
many
does
not
rank
him
among
the
few
poets
by
whom
the
student
should
form
his
taste
and
his
works
are
now
lost
he
was
small
and
thin
in
person
and
it
was
jokingly
said
of
him
that
he
wore
leaden
soles
to
his
shoes
lest
he
should
be
blown
away
by
the
wind
but
in
losing
his
poetry
we
have
perhaps
lost
the
point
of
the
joke
while
these
three
theocritus
callimachus
and
philastas
were
writing
in
alexandria
the
museum
was
certainly
the
chief
seat
of
the
muses
athens
itself
could
boast
of
no
such
poet
but
menander
with
whom
attic
literature
ended
and
him
philadelphus
earnestly
invited
to
his
court
he
sent
a
ship
to
greece
on
purpose
to
fetch
him
but
neither
this
honour
nor
the
promised
salary
could
make
him
quit
his
mother
country
and
the
schools
of
athens
and
in
the
time
of
pausanias
his
tomb
was
still
visited
by
the
scholar
on
the
road
to
the
pmeus
and
his
statue
was
still
seen
in
the
theatre
strato
the
pupil
of
theophrastus
though
chiefly
known
for
his
writings
on
physics
was
also
a
writer
on
many
branches
of
knowledge
he
was
one
of
the
men
of
learning
who
had
taken
part
in
the
education
of
and
the
king
showed
his
gratitude
to
his
teacher
by
making
him
a
present
of
eighty
talents
or
sixty
thousand
dollars
he
was
for
eighteen
years
at
the
head
of
one
of
the
alexandrian
schools
timocharis
the
astronomer
made
some
of
his
observations
at
alexandria
in
the
last
reign
and
continued
them
through
half
of
this
reign
he
began
a
catalogue
of
the
fixed
stars
with
their
latitudes
and
their
longitudes
measured
from
the
equinoctial
point
by
the
help
of
which
hipparchus
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
afterwards
made
the
great
discovery
that
the
equinoctial
point
had
moved
he
has
left
an
observation
of
the
place
of
venus
on
the
seventeenth
day
of
the
month
of
mesore
in
the
thirteenth
year
of
this
reign
which
by
the
modern
tables
of
the
planets
is
known
to
have
been
on
the
eighth
day
of
october
from
which
we
learn
that
the
first
year
of
philadelphus
ended
in
october
and
the
first
year
of
ptolemy
soter
ended
in
october
thus
fixing
the
chronology
of
these
reigns
with
a
certainty
which
leaves
nothing
to
be
wished
for
also
made
some
observations
of
the
same
kind
at
alexandria
few
of
them
have
been
handed
down
to
us
but
they
were
made
use
of
by
hipparchus
aristarchus
the
astronomer
of
samos
most
likely
came
to
alexandria
in
the
last
reign
as
some
of
his
observations
were
made
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
reign
of
philadelphus
he
is
the
first
astronomer
who
is
known
to
have
taken
the
true
view
of
the
solar
system
he
said
that
the
sun
was
the
centre
round
which
the
earth
moved
in
a
circle
and
as
if
he
had
foreseen
that
even
in
after
ages
we
should
hardly
be
able
to
measure
the
distance
of
the
fixed
stars
he
said
that
the
yearly
path
bore
no
greater
proportion
to
the
hollow
globe
of
the
heavens
in
which
the
stars
were
set
than
the
point
without
size
in
the
centre
of
a
circle
does
to
its
circumference
but
the
work
in
which
he
proved
these
great
truths
or
perhaps
threw
out
these
happy
guesses
is
lost
and
the
astronomers
who
followed
him
clung
to
the
old
belief
that
the
earth
was
the
centre
round
which
the
sun
moved
the
only
writings
of
aristarchus
which
now
remain
are
his
short
work
on
the
distances
and
magnitude
of
the
sun
and
moon
in
which
the
error
in
his
results
arises
from
the
want
of
good
observations
rather
than
from
any
mistake
in
his
mathematical
principles
aratus
who
was
born
in
cilicia
is
sometimes
counted
among
the
pléiades
or
seven
stars
of
alexandria
his
is
a
short
astronomical
poem
without
life
or
feeling
which
scarcely
aims
at
any
of
the
grace
or
flow
of
poetry
it
describes
the
planets
and
the
constellations
one
by
one
and
tells
us
what
stars
are
seen
in
the
head
feet
and
other
parts
of
each
figure
and
then
the
seasons
and
the
stars
seen
at
night
at
each
time
of
the
year
when
maps
were
little
known
it
must
have
been
of
great
use
to
learners
and
its
being
in
verse
made
it
the
more
easy
to
remember
the
value
which
the
ancients
set
upon
this
poem
is
curiously
shown
by
the
number
of
latin
translations
which
were
made
from
it
cicero
in
his
early
youth
before
he
was
known
as
an
orator
or
philosopher
perhaps
before
he
himself
knew
in
which
path
of
letters
he
was
soon
to
take
the
lead
translated
this
poem
the
next
translation
is
by
germanicus
cæsar
whose
early
death
and
many
good
qualities
have
thrown
such
a
bright
light
upon
his
name
he
shone
as
a
general
as
an
orator
and
as
an
author
but
his
greek
comedies
his
latin
orations
and
his
poem
on
augustus
are
lost
while
his
translation
of
aratus
is
all
that
is
left
to
prove
that
this
high
name
in
literature
was
not
given
to
him
for
his
political
virtues
alone
lastly
avienus
a
writer
in
the
reign
of
diocletian
or
perhaps
of
theodosius
has
left
a
rugged
unpolished
translation
of
this
poem
aratus

poet

the
heavens

be
read

long
as
the

and

shall
shine
sosibius
was
one
of
the
rhetoricians
of
the
museum
who
lived
upon
the
bounty
of
philadelphus
the
king
wishing
to
laugh
at
his
habit
of
verbal
criticism
once
told
his
treasurer
to
refuse
his
salary
and
say
that
it
had
been
already
paid
sosibius
complained
to
the
king
and
the
book
of
receipts
was
sent
for
in
which
philadelphus
found
the
names
of
soter
sosigines
bion
and
apollonius
and
showing
to
the
critic
one
syllable
of
his
name
in
each
of
those
words
said
that
putting
them
together
they
must
be
taken
as
the
receipt
for
his
salary
other
authors
wrote
on
lighter
matters

philadelphus

greek
wines

the
italian

and
those
of
the

were
wholly
beneath
his
notice
while
the
vine
had
as
yet
hardly
been
planted
in
the
neighbourhood
of
alexandria
he
particularly
praised
the

but
above
all
these
he
placed
the

from
the
island
of
peparethus
a
wine
which
of
course
did
not
please
the
many
as
this
experienced
taster
acknowledges
that
nobody
is
likely
to
have
a
true
relish
for
it
till
after
six
acquaintance
such
were
the
greek
authors
who
basked
in
the
sunshine
of
royal
favour
at
alexandria
who
could
have
told
us
if
they
had
thought
it
worth
their
while
all
that
we
now
wish
to
know
of
the
trade
religion
language
and
early
history
of
egypt
but
they
thought
that
the
barbarians
were
not
worth
the
notice
of
men
who
called
themselves
macedonians
philadelphus
however
thought
otherwise
and
by
his
command
manetho
an
egyptian
wrote
in
greek
a
history
of
egypt
copied
from
the
hieroglyphical
writing
on
the
temples
and
he
dedicated
it
to
the
king
we
know
it
only
in
the
quotations
of
josephus
and
julius
africanus
and
what
we
have
is
little
more
than
a
list
of
names
he
was
a
priest
of
heliopolis
the
great
seat
of
egyptian
learning
the
general
correctness
of
history
which
runs
back
for
nearly
two
thousand
years
is
shown
by
our
finding
the
names
agree
with
many
egyptian
inscriptions
manetho
owes
his
reputation
to
the
merit
of
being
the
first
who
distinguished
himself
as
a
writer
and
critic
upon
religion
and
philosophy
as
well
as
chronology
and
history
using
the
greek
language
but
drawing
his
materials
from
native
sources
especially
the
sacred
books
that
he
was
in
greek
we
learn
from
josephus
who
also
declares
that
he
contradicted
many
of
erroneous
statements
manetho
was
better
suited
for
the
task
of
writing
a
history
of
egypt
than
any
of
his
contemporaries
as
an
egyptian
he
could
search
out
and
make
use
of
all
the
native
egyptian
sources
and
thanks
to
his
knowledge
of
greek
he
could
present
them
in
a
form
intelligible
to
the
hellenes
it
must
be
confessed
that
he
has
occasionally
fallen
into
the
error
of
allowing
greek
thoughts
and
traditions
to
slip
into
his
work
the
great
worth
in
work
lies
in
the
fact
that
he
relates
the
history
of
egypt
based
on
monumental
sources
and
charters
preserved
in
the
temples
moreover
he
treats
quite
impartially
the
times
of
the
foreign
rulers
which
the
form
of
the
egyptian
history
employed
by
diodorus
does
not
mention
but
above
all
manetho
gives
us
a
list
of
egyptian
rulers
arranged
according
to
a
regular
system
but
however
important
in
this
respect
work
may
be
it
must
not
be
forgotten
what
difficulties
he
had
to
contend
with
in
the
writing
of
it
and
what
unreliable
sources
lay
in
these
difficulties
he
could
not
use
the
sources
in
the
form
in
which
he
found
them
he
was
obliged
to
them
and
he
added
to
them
synchronisms
and
relations
to
other
peoples
which
necessarily
exposed
him
to
the
dangers
of
colouring
his
report
correspondingly
but
a
much
greater
difficulty
consisted
in
the
fact
that
the
chronological
reports
of
the
earlier
history
were
all
arranged
according
to
the
reigning
years
of
the
rulers
so
that
manetho
was
obliged
to
construct
an
era
for
his
work
boeckh
was
the
first
to
discover
with
certainty
the
existence
and
form
of
this
era
according
to
his
researches
the
whole
work
of
manetho
is
based
upon
sothicycles
of
julianic
years
the
egyptian
year
was
movable
and
did
not
need
the
extra
day
every
few
years
but
the
consequence
was
that
every
year
remained
a
quarter
of
a
day
behind
the
real
year
illustration
modern
face
when
years
had
elapsed
this
chronological
error
had
mounted
to
a
whole
year
and
so
the
movable
year
and
the
fixed
year
fell
together
again
it
is
this
sothic
period
which
manetho
has
employed
in
his
account
of
egyptian
history
besides
his
history
manetho
has
left
us
a
work
on
astrology
called
or
events
a
work
of
which
there
seems
no
reason
to
doubt
the
genuineness
it
is
a
poem
in
hexameter
verse
in
good
greek
addressed
to
king
ptolemy
in
which
he
calls
not
only
upon
apollo
and
the
muse
but
like
a
true
egyptian
upon
hermes
from
whose
darkly
worded
writings
he
had
gained
his
knowledge
he
says
that
the
greatness
might
have
been
foretold
from
the
places
of
mars
and
the
sun
at
the
time
of
his
birth
and
that
his
marriage
with
his
sister
arsinoë
arose
from
the
places
of
venus
and
saturn
at
the
same
time
but
while
we
smile
at
this
being
said
as
the
result
of
astronomical
calculations
we
must
remember
that
for
centuries
afterwards
almost
in
our
own
time
the
science
of
judicial
astrology
was
made
a
branch
of
astronomy
and
that
the
fault
lay
rather
in
the
age
than
in
the
man
and
we
have
the
pain
of
thinking
that
while
many
of
the
valuable
writings
by
manetho
are
lost
the
copiers
and
readers
of
manuscripts
have
carefully
saved
for
us
this
nearly
worthless
poem
on
astrology
petosiris
was
another
writer
on
astrology
and
astronomy
who
was
highly
praised
by
his
friend
manetho
and
his
calculations
on
the
distances
of
the
sun
and
planets
are
quoted
by
pliny
his
works
are
lost
but
his
name
calls
for
our
notice
as
he
must
have
been
a
native
egyptian
and
a
priest
like
manetho
he
also
wrote
on
the
calculation
of
nativities
and
the
later
greek
astrologers
when
what
they
had
foretold
did
not
come
to
pass
were
wont
to
lay
the
blame
on
petosiris
the
priests
were
believed
to
possess
these
and
other
supernatural
powers
and
to
help
their
claims
to
be
believed
many
of
them
practised
ventriloquism
timosthenes
the
admiral
under
philadelphus
must
not
be
forgotten
in
this
list
of
authors
for
though
his
verses
to
apollo
were
little
worth
notice
his
voyages
of
discovery
and
his
work
in
ten
books
on
harbours
placed
him
in
the
first
rank
among
geographers
colotes
a
pupil
and
follower
of
epicurus
dedicated
to
philadelphus
a
work
of
which
the
very
title
proves
the
nature
of
his
philosophy
and
how
soon
the
rules
of
his
master
had
fitted
themselves
to
the
habits
of
the
sensualist
its
title
was
it
is
impossible
even
to
support
life
according
to
the
philosophical
rules
of
any
but
the
it
was
a
good
deal
read
and
talked
about
and
three
hundred
years
afterwards
plutarch
thought
it
not
a
waste
of
time
to
write
against
it
at
some
length
at
a
time
when
books
were
few
and
far
too
dear
to
be
within
reach
of
the
many
and
indeed
when
the
number
of
those
who
could
read
must
have
been
small
other
means
were
of
course
taken
to
meet
the
thirst
after
knowledge
and
the
chief
of
these
were
the
public
readings
in
the
theatre
this
was
not
overlooked
by
who
employed
hegesias
to
read
herodotus
and
hermophantus
to
read
homer
the
earliest
historian
and
the
earliest
poet
the
two
authors
who
had
taken
deepest
root
in
the
minds
of
the
greeks
these
public
readings
which
were
common
throughout
greece
and
its
colonies
had
not
a
little
effect
on
the
authors
they
then
wrote
for
the
ear
rather
than
the
eye
to
be
listened
to
rather
than
to
be
read
which
was
one
among
the
causes
of
greek
elegance
and
simplicity
of
style
among
others
who
were
brought
to
alexandria
by
the
fame
of
bounty
was
zoilus
the
grammarian
whose
criticism
on
poems
had
earned
for
him
the
name
of
homeromastix
or
the
scourge
of
homer
he
read
his
criticisms
to
philadelphus
who
was
so
much
displeased
with
his
carping
and
unfair
manner
of
finding
fault
that
he
even
refused
to
relieve
him
when
in
distress
the
king
told
him
that
while
hundreds
had
earned
a
livelihood
by
pointing
out
the
beauties
of
the
iliad
and
odyssey
in
their
public
readings
surely
one
person
who
was
so
much
wiser
might
be
able
to
live
by
pointing
out
the
faults
timon
a
tragic
poet
was
also
one
of
the
visitors
to
this
court
but
as
he
was
more
fond
of
eating
and
drinking
than
of
philosophy
we
need
not
wonder
at
our
knowing
nothing
of
his
tragedies
or
at
his
not
being
made
a
professor
by
philadelphus
but
he
took
his
revenge
on
the
philosophers
of
the
court
in
a
poem
in
which
he
calls
them
literary
who
were
being
fattened
by
the
king
and
were
always
quarrelling
in
the
coops
of
the
museum
the
alexandrian
men
of
science
and
letters
maintained
themselves
some
few
by
fees
received
from
their
pupils
others
as
professors
holding
salaries
in
the
museum
and
others
by
civil
employments
under
the
government
there
was
little
to
encourage
in
them
the
feelings
of
noble
pride
or
independence
the
first
rank
in
alexandria
was
held
by
the
civil
and
military
servants
of
the
crown
who
enjoyed
the
lucrative
employments
of
receiving
the
taxes
hearing
the
lawsuits
by
appeal
and
repressing
rebellions
with
these
men
the
philosophers
mixed
not
as
equals
but
partaking
of
their
wealth
and
luxuries
and
paying
their
score
with
wit
and
conversation
there
were
no
landholders
in
the
city
as
the
soil
of
the
country
was
owned
by
egyptians
and
the
wealthy
trading
classes
of
all
nations
and
languages
could
bestow
little
patronage
on
greek
learning
and
therefore
little
independence
on
its
professors
philadelphus
was
not
less
fond
of
paintings
and
statues
than
of
books
and
he
seems
to
have
joined
the
achaian
league
as
much
for
the
sake
of
the
pictures
which
aratus
its
general
was
in
the
habit
of
sending
to
him
as
for
political
reasons
aratus
the
chief
of
sicyon
was
an
acknowledged
judge
of
paintings
and
sicyon
was
then
the
first
school
of
greece
the
pieces
which
he
sent
to
philadelphus
were
mostly
those
of
pamphilus
the
master
and
of
melanthius
the
of
apelles
pamphilus
was
famed
for
his
perspective
and
he
is
said
to
have
received
from
every
pupil
the
large
sum
of
ten
talents
or
seven
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
a
year
his
best
known
pieces
were
ulysses
in
his
ship
and
the
victory
of
the
athenians
near
the
town
of
phlius
it
was
through
pamphilus
that
at
first
in
sicyon
and
afterwards
throughout
all
greece
drawing
was
taught
to
boys
as
part
of
a
liberal
education
neacles
also
painted
for
aratus
and
we
might
almost
suppose
that
it
was
as
a
gift
to
the
king
of
egypt
that
he
painted
his
between
the
egyptians
and
the
persians
in
which
the
painter
shows
us
that
it
was
fought
within
the
mouth
of
the
nile
by
making
a
crocodile
bite
at
an
ass
drinking
on
the
shore
helena
the
daughter
of
timon
was
a
painter
of
some
note
at
this
time
at
alexandria
but
the
only
piece
of
hers
known
to
us
by
name
is
the
battle
of
issus
which
three
hundred
years
afterwards
was
hung
up
by
vespasian
in
the
temple
of
peace
at
rome
we
must
wonder
at
a
woman
choosing
to
paint
the
horrors
and
pains
of
a
but
as
we
are
not
told
what
point
of
time
was
chosen
we
may
hope
that
it
was
after
the
battle
when
alexander
in
his
tent
raised
up
from
their
knees
the
wife
and
lovely
daughter
of
darius
who
had
been
found
among
the
prisoners
as
for
the
egyptians
they
showed
no
taste
in
painting
illustration
method
of
egyptian
draftsmanship
their
method
of
drawing
the
human
figure
mathematically
by
means
of
squares
which
was
not
unsuitable
in
working
a
statue
sixty
feet
high
checked
all
flights
of
genius
and
it
afterwards
destroyed
greek
art
when
the
greek
painters
were
idle
enough
to
use
it
we
hear
but
little
of
the
statues
and
sculptures
made
for
philadelphus
but
we
can
not
help
remarking
that
while
the
public
places
of
athens
were
filled
with
the
statues
of
the
great
and
good
men
who
had
deserved
well
of
their
country
the
statues
which
were
most
common
in
alexandria
were
those
of
cline
a
favourite
damsel
who
filled
the
office
of
to
the
king
of
egypt
the
favour
shown
to
the
jews
by
ptolemy
soter
was
not
withdrawn
by
his
son
he
even
bought
from
his
own
soldiers
and
freed
from
slavery
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
of
that
nation
who
were
scattered
over
egypt
he
paid
for
each
out
of
the
royal
treasury
one
hundred
and
twenty
drachmas
or
about
fifteen
dollars
to
those
of
his
subjects
who
held
them
either
by
right
of
war
or
by
purchase
in
fixing
the
amount
of
the
ransom
the
king
would
seem
to
have
been
guided
by
his
jewish
advisers
as
this
is
exactly
equal
to
thirty
shekels
the
sum
fixed
by
the
jewish
law
as
the
price
of
a
slave
the
jews
who
lived
in
lower
egypt
in
the
enjoyment
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
looked
upon
that
country
as
their
home
they
had
already
a
greek
translation
of
either
the
whole
or
some
part
of
their
sacred
writings
which
had
been
made
for
those
whose
families
had
been
for
so
many
generations
in
egypt
that
they
could
not
read
the
language
of
their
forefathers
but
they
now
hoped
by
means
of
the
friendship
and
the
weight
which
his
wishes
must
carry
with
them
to
have
a
greek
translation
of
the
bible
which
should
bear
the
stamp
of
official
authority
accordingly
to
please
them
philadelphus
sent
a
man
whose
wisdom
had
gained
his
friendship
and
andrseus
a
captain
of
the
guard
both
of
them
greek
jews
with
costly
gifts
to
eleazer
the
high
priest
of
jerusalem
and
asked
him
to
employ
learned
and
fit
men
to
make
a
greek
translation
of
the
bible
for
the
library
at
alexandria
eleazer
so
runs
the
tradition
named
seventy
elders
to
undertake
the
task
who
held
their
first
sitting
on
the
business
at
the
when
menedemus
the
socratic
philosopher
the
pupil
of
plato
was
also
present
who
had
been
sent
to
philadelphus
as
ambassador
from
eubcea
the
translators
then
divided
the
work
among
themselves
and
when
each
had
finished
his
task
it
wras
laid
before
a
meeting
of
the
seventy
and
then
published
by
authority
thus
was
said
to
have
been
made
the
greek
translation
of
the
old
testament
which
from
the
number
of
the
translators
we
now
call
the
septuagint
but
a
doubt
is
thrown
upon
the
whole
story
by
the
fables
which
have
been
mingled
with
it
to
give
authority
to
the
translation
by
this
translation
the
bible
became
known
for
the
first
time
to
the
greek
philosophers
we
do
not
indeed
hear
that
they
immediately
read
it
or
noticed
it
we
do
not
find
it
quoted
till
after
the
spread
of
christianity
but
it
had
a
silent
effect
on
their
opinions
which
we
trace
in
the
new
school
of
platonists
soon
afterwards
rising
in
alexandria
when
aratus
of
sicyon
first
laid
a
plot
to
free
his
country
from
its
tyrant
who
reigned
by
the
help
of
the
king
of
macedonia
he
sent
to
philadelphus
to
beg
for
money
he
naturally
looked
to
the
king
of
egypt
for
help
when
entering
upon
a
struggle
against
their
common
rival
but
the
king
seems
to
have
thought
the
plans
of
this
young
man
too
wild
to
be
countenanced
aratus
however
soon
raised
sicyon
to
a
level
with
the
first
states
of
greece
and
made
himself
leader
of
the
achaian
league
under
which
band
and
name
the
greeks
were
then
struggling
for
freedom
against
macedonia
and
when
by
his
courage
and
success
he
had
shown
himself
worthy
of
the
proud
name
which
was
afterwards
given
him
of
the
of
the
greeks
philadelphus
like
other
patrons
gave
him
the
help
which
he
less
needed
aratus
as
we
have
seen
bought
his
friendship
with
pictures
the
gifts
of
all
others
the
most
welcome
and
when
he
went
to
egypt
philadelphus
gave
him
one
hundred
and
fifty
talents
or
thousand
dollars
and
joined
the
achaian
league
on
the
agreement
that
in
carrying
on
the
war
by
sea
and
land
they
should
obey
the
orders
from
alexandria
the
friendship
of
philadelphus
indeed
was
courted
by
all
the
neighbouring
states
the
little
island
of
delos
set
up
its
statue
to
him
and
the
cities
of
greece
vied
with
one
another
in
doing
him
honour
the
athenians
named
one
of
the
tribes
of
their
city
and
also
one
of
their
public
by
his
name
and
two
hundred
years
afterwards
when
cicero
and
his
friend
atticus
were
learning
wisdom
and
eloquence
from
the
lips
of
antiochus
in
athens
it
was
in
the
gymnasium
of
ptolemy
philadelphus
when
young
had
married
arsinoë
the
daughter
of
lysimachus
of
thrace
by
whom
he
had
three
children
ptolemy
who
succeeded
him
lysimachus
and
berenicê
but
having
found
that
his
wife
was
intriguing
with
amyntas
and
with
his
physician
chrysippus
of
rhodes
he
put
these
two
to
death
and
banished
the
queen
arsinoë
to
koptos
in
the
thebaid
he
then
took
arsinoë
his
own
sister
as
the
partner
of
his
throne
she
had
married
first
the
old
lysimachus
king
of
thrace
and
then
ceraunus
her
when
he
was
king
of
macedonia
as
they
were
not
children
of
the
same
mother
this
second
marriage
was
neither
illegal
nor
improper
in
macedonia
but
her
third
marriage
with
philadelphus
could
only
be
justified
by
the
laws
of
egypt
their
adopted
country
they
were
both
past
the
middle
age
and
whether
philadelphus
looked
upon
her
as
his
wife
or
not
at
any
rate
they
had
no
children
her
own
children
by
lysimachus
had
been
put
to
death
by
ceraunus
and
she
readily
adopted
those
of
her
brother
with
all
the
kindness
of
a
mother
she
was
a
woman
of
an
enlarged
mind
her
husband
and
her
stepchildren
alike
valued
her
and
eratosthenes
showed
his
opinion
of
her
learning
and
strong
sense
by
giving
the
name
of
arsinoë
to
one
of
his
works
which
perhaps
a
modern
writer
would
have
named
illustration
coin
with
the
heads
of
soter
and
philadelphus
and
arsinoë
this
seeming
marriage
however
between
brother
and
sister
did
not
escape
blame
with
the
greeks
of
alexandria
the
poet
sotades
whose
verses
were
as
licentious
as
his
life
wrote
some
coarse
lines
against
the
queen
for
which
he
was
forced
to
fly
from
egypt
and
being
overtaken
at
sea
he
was
wrapped
up
in
lead
and
thrown
overboard
in
the
egyptian
inscriptions
ptolemy
and
arsinoë
are
always
called
the
on
the
coins
they
are
called
adelphi
the
brothers
and
afterwards
the
king
took
the
name
of
philadelphus
or
by
which
he
is
now
usually
known
in
the
first
half
of
his
reign
philadelphus
dated
his
coins
from
the
year
that
his
father
came
to
the
throne
and
it
was
not
till
the
nineteenth
year
of
his
reign
soon
after
the
death
of
his
mother
that
he
made
an
era
of
his
own
and
dated
his
coins
by
the
year
of
his
own
reign
the
wealth
of
the
country
is
well
shown
by
the
great
size
of
those
most
in
use
which
were
in
gold
the
or
piece
of
eight
drachms
and
in
silver
the
or
piece
of
four
drachms
while
greece
had
hardly
seen
a
piece
of
gold
larger
than
the
single
stater
in
alexandrian
accounts
also
the
unit
of
money
was
the
silver
didrachm
and
thus
double
that
in
use
among
the
merchants
of
greece
illustration
coin
with
the
heads
of
soter
philadelphus
and
berenice
among
the
coins
is
one
with
the
heads
of
soter
and
philadelphus
on
the
one
side
and
the
head
of
berenicê
the
wife
of
the
one
and
mother
of
the
other
on
the
other
side
this
we
may
suppose
to
have
been
struck
during
the
first
two
years
of
his
reign
in
the
lifetime
of
his
father
another
bears
on
one
side
the
heads
of
ptolemy
soter
and
berenicê
with

called

set
up
in

the
architect
had
the
charge
of
moving

he
dug
a
canal
to
it
as
it
lay
upon
the
ground
and
moved
two
heavily
laden
barges
under
it
the
burdens
were
then
taken
out
of
the
barges
and
as
they
floated
higher
they
raised
the

off
the
ground
he
then
found
it
a
task
as
great
or
greater
to
set
it
up
in
its
place
and
this
greek
engineer
must
surely
have
looked
back
with
wonder
on
the
labour
and
knowledge
of
mechanics
which
must
have
been
used
in
setting
up
the
obelisks
colossal
statues
and
pyramids
which
he
saw
scattered
over

ornaments
the

satyrus
wrote
a

on

stones

he
also
carved

great
skill
but
his
works
are
known
only
in
the
following
lines
which
were
written
by
diodorus
on

in

to
trace

two

extant
one
with

and
his

and
the
other
with
the
heads
of
the

king
and
his
second
wife
arsinoë
it
is
not
impossible
that
one
or
both
of
them
may
be
the
work
of
satyrus
philadelphus
is
also
said
to
have
listened
to
the
whimsical
proposal
of
dinochares
the
architect
to
build
a
room
of
loadstone
in
tomb
so
that
an
iron
statue
of
the
queen
should
hang
in
the
air
between
the
floor
and
the
roof
but
the
death
of
the
king
and
of
the
architect
took
place
before
this
was
tried
he
set
up
there
however
her
statue
six
feet
high
carved
out
of
a
most
remarkable
block
of
topaz
which
had
been
presented
to
his
mother
by
philemon
the
prefect
of
the
troglodytic
coast
in
the
last
reign
philadelphus
lived
in
peace
with
ergamenes
king
of
meroë
or
upper
ethiopia
who
while
seeking
for
a
knowledge
of
philosophy
and
the
arts
of
life
from
his
greek
neighbours
seems
also
to
have
gained
a
love
of
despotism
and
a
dislike
of
that
control
with
which
the
priests
of
ethiopia
and
egypt
had
always
limited
the
power
of
their
kings
the
king
of
meroë
had
hitherto
reigned
like
amenôthes
or
thutmosis
of
old
as
the
head
of
the
priesthood
supported
and
controlled
by
the
priestly
aristocracy
by
which
he
was
surrounded
but
he
longed
for
the
absolute
power
of
philadelphus
accordingly
he
surrounded
the
golden
temple
with
a
chosen
body
of
troops
and
put
the
whole
of
the
priests
to
death
and
from
that
time
he
governed
ethiopia
as
an
autocrat
but
with
the
loss
of
their
liberties
the
ethiopians
lost
the
wish
to
guard
the
throne
by
grasping
at
more
power
their
sovereign
lost
what
he
already
possessed
and
in
the
next
reign
their
country
was
conquered
by
egypt
the
wars
between
philadelphus
and
his
great
neighbour
antiochus
theos
seem
not
to
have
been
carried
on
very
actively
though
they
did
not
wholly
cease
till
philadelphus
offered
as
a
bribe
his
daughter
berenicê
with
a
large
sum
of
money
under
the
name
of
a
dower
antiochus
was
already
married
to
laodice
whom
he
loved
dearly
and
by
whom
he
had
two
children
seleucus
and
antiochus
but
political
ambition
had
deadened
the
feelings
of
his
heart
and
he
agreed
to
declare
this
first
marriage
void
and
his
two
sons
illegitimate
and
that
his
children
if
any
should
be
born
to
him
by
berenicê
should
inherit
the
throne
of
babylon
and
the
east
philadelphus
with
an
equal
want
of
feeling
and
disregarding
the
consequences
of
such
a
marriage
led
his
daughter
to
pelusium
on
her
journey
to
her
betrothed
husband
and
sent
with
her
so
large
a
sum
of
gold
and
silver
that
he
was
nicknamed
the
the
peace
between
the
two
countries
lasted
as
long
as
philadelphus
lived
and
was
strengthened
by
kindnesses
which
each
did
to
the
other
ptolemy
when
in
syria
was
much
struck
by
the
beauty
of
a
statue
of
diana
and
begged
it
of
antiochus
as
an
ornament
for
alexandria
but
as
soon
as
the
statue
reached
egypt
arsinoë
fell
dangerously
ill
and
she
dreamed
that
the
goddess
came
by
night
and
told
her
that
the
illness
was
sent
to
her
for
the
wrong
done
to
the
statue
by
her
husband
and
accordingly
it
was
sent
back
with
many
gifts
to
the
temple
from
which
it
had
been
brought
while
berenicê
and
her
husband
lived
at
antioch
philadelphus
kindly
sent
there
from
time
to
time
water
from
the
sacred
nile
for
her
use
as
the
egyptians
believed
that
none
other
was
so
wholesome
antiochus
when
ill
sent
to
alexandria
for
a
physician
and
cleombrotus
of
cos
accordingly
went
by
command
of
ptolemy
to
syria
he
was
successful
in
curing
the
king
and
on
his
return
he
received
from
philadelphus
a
present
of
one
hundred
talents
or
thousand
dollars
as
a
fee
for
his
journey
philadelphus
was
a
weak
frame
of
body
and
had
delicate
health
and
though
a
lover
of
learning
beyond
other
kings
of
his
time
he
also
surpassed
them
in
his
unmeasured
luxury
and
love
of
pleasure
he
had
many
mistresses
egyptian
as
well
as
greek
and
the
names
of
some
of
them
have
been
handed
down
to
us
he
often
boasted
that
he
had
found
out
the
way
to
live
for
ever
but
like
other
he
was
sometimes
by
the
gout
in
his
feet
made
to
acknowledge
that
he
was
only
a
man
and
indeed
to
wish
that
he
could
change
places
with
the
beggar
whom
he
saw
from
his
palace
windows
eating
the
garbage
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
with
an
appetite
which
he
had
long
wanted
it
was
during
illness
that
he
found
most
time
for
reading
and
his
mind
most
open
to
the
truths
of
philosophy
and
he
chiefly
wooed
the
muses
when
ill
health
left
him
at
leisure
from
his
other
courtships
he
had
a
fleet
of
eight
hundred
state
barges
with
gilt
prows
and
poops
and
scarlet
awnings
upon
the
decks
which
were
used
in
the
royal
processions
and
religious
shows
and
which
usually
lay
in
dock
at
schedia
on
the
canopic
river
five
and
twenty
miles
from
alexandria
he
was
no
doubt
in
part
withheld
from
war
by
this
luxurious
love
of
ease
but
his
reign
taught
the
world
the
new
lesson
that
an
ambitious
monarch
may
gratify
his
wish
for
praise
and
gain
the
admiration
of
surrounding
nations
as
much
by
cultivating
the
blessed
arts
of
peace
as
by
plunging
his
people
into
the
miseries

him

hope

the

no

under
the
guidance

in

manned

egyptians

inland

wholly
unfitted
them
for

prejudices
made
them
feel
the
conscription
for

as

heavy
grievance
these

the
costly

of
an

so
drew
the

proverb
if
any

for

it

called

is
true
that
many
of

advantages
were
forced
in
the
hotbed
of
royal
patronage
that
the
navy
was
built
in
the

minor
and
that
the
men
of
letters
who
then
drew
upon
themselves
the
eyes
of
the
world
were
only
greek
settlers
whose
writings
could
have
done
little
to
raise
the
character
of
the
native
kopts

the
ptolemies
in
raising
this
building

own
were
not

on

freedom
and
even
if
the
greek
settlers
in

delta
had
formed
themselves
into
a
free
state
we
can
hardly
believe
that
the
egyptians
would
have
been
so
well
treated
as
they
were
by
this
military
despotism
from
the
temples
which
were
built
or
enlarged
in
upper
egypt
and
from
the
beauty
of
the
hieroglyphical
inscriptions
we
find
that
even
the
native
arts
were
more
flourishing
than
they
had
ever
been
since
the
fall
of
the
kings
of
thebes
and
we
may
almost
look
upon
the
greek
conquest
as
a
blessing
to
upper
egypt
philadelphus
though
weak
in
body
was
well
suited
by
his
and
intelligence
for
the
tasks
which
the
state
of
affairs
at
that
time
demanded
from
an
egyptian
king
he
was
a
diplomat
rather
than
a
warrior
and
that
was
exactly
what
egypt
needed
a
curious
anecdote
about
ptolemy
philadelphus
is
related
by
niebuhr
he
had
reached
the
zenith
of
his
glory
when
suddenly
he
was
attacked
by
a
species
of
insanity
consisting
of
an
indescribable
fear
of
death
chemical
artifices
were
practised
in
egypt
from
the
earliest
times
and
hence
ptolemy
took
every
imaginable
pains
to
find
the
elixir
of
life
but
it
was
all
in
vain
for
his
strength
was
rapidly
decreasing
once
like
louis
he
was
looking
from
a
window
of
his
palace
upon
the
seacoast
and
seriously
meditated
upon
the
subject
of
his
longing
it
must
have
been
in
when
the
sand
exposed
to
the
rays
of
the
sun
becomes
very
warm
he
saw
some
poor
boys
burying
themselves
in
the
warm
sand
and
screaming
with
delight
and
the
aged
king
began
bitterly
to
cry
seeing
the
ragged
urchins
enjoying
their
life
without
any
apprehension
of
losing
it
for
he
felt
that
with
all
his
riches
he
could
not
purchase
that
happiness
and
that
his
end
was
very
near
at
hand
he
died
in
the
year
of
his
reign
and
perhaps
the
of
his
age
he
left
the
kingdom
as
powerful
and
more
wealthy
than
when
it
came
to
him
from
his
father
and
he
had
the
happiness
of
having
a
son
who
would
carry
on

for

back
also
from
this
expedition
a
vast
number
of
other
works
of
art
for
the
museums
were
a
passion
with
the
ptolemies
the
asiatics
might
indeed
have
got
over
these
things
but
he
levied
in
addition
immense
contributions
from
the
asiatics
and
is
said
to
have
raised
over
forty
thousand
talents
on
his
march
homeward
he
laid
his
gifts
upon
the
altar
in
the
temple
of
jerusalem
and
there
returned
thanks
to
heaven
for
his
victories
he
had
been
taught
to
bow
the
knee
to
the
crowds
of
greek
and
egyptian
gods
and
as
palestine
was
part
of
his
kingdom
it
seemed
quite
natural
to
add
the
god
of
the
jews
to
the
list
of
the
insurrection
in
egypt
which
obliged
him
to
return
we
know
no
particulars
but
euergetes
seems
to
have
become
convinced
that
egypt
was
too
small
a
basis
for
such
an
empire
he
had
wished
to
retain
all
his
relates
the
chronicler
would
have
been
obliged
to
make
antioch
his
residence
and
this
would
weaken
the
ground
of
his
strength
he
moreover
appears
to
have
been
well
aware
that
the
conquests
had
been
made
too
he
accordingly
divided
them
retaining
for
himself
syria
as
far
as
euphrates
and
the
coast
districts
of
asia
minor
and
thrace
so
that
he
had
a
complete
maritime
empire
the
remaining
territories
he
divided
into
two
states
the
country
beyond
the
euphrates
was
given
according
to
jerome
to
one
xantippus
who
is
otherwise
unknown
and
western
asia
was
left
to
antiochus
hierax
it
would
seem
that
after
this
he
never
visited
those
countries
again
one
of
the
notable
incidents
of
the
war
against
syria
was
an
offer
of
help
to
egypt
from
the
romans
from
the
middle
of
the
reign
of
philadelphus
till
the
fifth
year
of
this
reign
for
years
the
romans
had
been
struggling
with
the
carthaginians
for
their
very
being
in
the
first
punic
war
which
they
had
just
brought
to
a
close
and
on
hearing
of
war
in
syria
they
sent
to
egypt
with
friendly
offers
of
help
but
their
ambassadors
did
not
reach
alexandria
before
peace
was
made
and
they
were
sent
home
with
many
thanks
the
event
serves
to
show
the
trend
of
the
aspirations
of
this
now
important
nation
which
was
afterwards
destined
to
engulf
the
kingdoms
of
egypt
and
syria
alike
after
euergetes
had
as
he
thought
established
his
authority
in
asia
a
party
hostile
to
him
came
forward
to
oppose
him
the
rhodians
with
their
wise
policy
who
had
hitherto
given
no
decided
support
to
either
empire
now
stepped
forward
setting
to
other
maritime
cities
the
example
of
joining
that
hostile
party
the
confederates
formed
a
fleet
with
the
assistance
of
which
and
supported
by
a
general
insurrection
of
the
asiatics
who
were
exasperated
against
the
egyptians
on
account
of
their
rapacity
seleucus
callinicus
rallied
again
illustration
an
abyssinian
slave
he
recovered
the
whole
of
upper
asia
and
for
a
time
he
was
united
with
his
brother
antiochus
hierax
the
insurrection
in
egypt
must
have
been
of
a
very
serious
nature
and
ptolemy
being
pressed
on
all
sides
concluded
a
truce
of
ten
years
with
seleucus
on
basis
of
both
parties
seem
to
have
retained
the
places
which
they
possessed
at
the
time
so
that
all
the
disadvantage
was
on
the
side
of
the
seleucidæ
for
the
fortified
town
of
seleucia
for
example
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
egyptians
whereby
the
capital
was
placed
in
a
dangerous
position
a
part
of
cilicia
the
whole
of
caria
the
ionian
cities
the
thracian
chersonesus
and
several
macedonian
towns
likewise
continued
to
belong
to
egypt
soon
after
his
in
egypt
euergetes
was
solicited
by
cleomenes
the
king
of
sparta
to
grant
the
assistance
of
his
arms
in
the
struggle
which
that
republic
was
then
supporting
with
antigonus
the
ruler
of
macedon
and
with
the
members
of
the
achaian
league
but
the
battle
of
sellasia
proved
that
the
aid
offered
was
inadequate
cleomenes
fled
to
the
banks
of
the
nile
where
he
found
his
august
ally
reposing
under
the
successful
banners
of
a
numerous
army
which
he
had
just
led
home
from
the
savage
mountains
of
ethiopia
whither
his
love
of
romantic
conquest
had
conducted
them
he
appears
to
have
penetrated
into
the
interior
provinces
of
abyssinia
and
to
have
subdued
the
rude
tribes
which
dwelt
on
the
shores
of
the
red
sea
levying
on
the
unfortunate
natives
the
most
oppressive
contributions
in
cattle
gold
perfumes
and
other
articles
belonging
to
that
valuable
merchandise
which
the
ethiopians
and
arabs
had
long
carried
on
with
their
egyptian
neighbours
at
adule
the
principal
seaport
of
abyssinia
he
collected
his
victorious
troops
and
made
them
a
speech
on
the
wonderful
exploits
which
they
had
achieved
under
his
auspices
and
on
the
numerous
benefits
which
they
had
thereby
secured
to
their
native
country
the
throne
on
which
he
sat
composed
of
white
marble
and
supported
by
a
slab
of
porphyry
was
consecrated
to
the
god
of
war
whom
he
chose
to
claim
for
his
father
and
patron
and
that
the
descendants
of
the
vanquished
ethiopians
might
not
be
ignorant
of
their
obligations
to
ptolemy
euergetes
king
of
egypt
he
gave
orders
that
his
name
and
principal
triumphs
should
be
inscribed
on
the
votive
chair
but
not
content
with
his
real
conquests
which
reached
from
the
hellespont
to
the
euphrates
he
added
like
ramsesr
that
he
had
conquered
thrace
persia
media
and
bactria
he
thus
teaches
us
that
monumental
inscriptions
though
read
with
difficulty
do
not
always
tell
the
truth
this
was
the
most
southerly
spot
to
which
the
kings
of
egypt
ever
sent
an
army
but
they
kept
no
hold
on
the
country
distance
had
placed
it
not
only
beyond
their
power
but
almost
beyond
their
knowledge
and
two
hundred
years
afterwards
when
the
geographer
strabo
was
making
inquiries
about
that
part
of
arabia
as
it
was
called
he
was
told
of
this
monument
as
set
up
by
the
hero
sesostris
to
whom
it
was
usual
to
give
the
credit
of
so
many
wonderful
works
these
inscriptions
it
is
worthy
of
remark
are
still
preserved
and
constitute
the
only
historical
account
that
has
reached
these
times
of
the
ethiopian
warfare
of
this
egyptian
monarch

seven
hundred
years

as
a

ever
recompensed
the

euergetes

the
fierce
barbarians

the

euergetes
as
part
of
his
general
policy
of
conciliating
the
egyptians
enlarged
the
great
temple
at
thebes
which
is
now
called
the
temple
of
karnak
on
the
walls
of
which
we
see
him
handing
an
offering
to
his
father
and
mother
the
in
one
place
he
is
in
a
greek
dress
which
is
not
common
on
the
ptolemaic
buildings
as
most
of
the
greek
kings
are
carved
upon
the
walls
in
the
dress
of
the
country
the
early
kings
had
often
shown
their
piety
to
a
temple
by
enlarging
the
sacred
area
and
adding
a
new
wall
and
gateway
in
front
of
the
former
and
this
custom
euergetes
followed
at
karnak
as
these
grand
stone
sculptured
gateways
belonged
to
a
wall
of
unbaked
bricks
which
has
long
since
crumbled
to
pieces
they
now
stand
apart
like
so
many
triumphal
arches

also
added

the
temple

gate
at
karnak
he
built
a
temple
to
osiris
at
canopus
on
the
mouth
of
the
nile
for
notwithstanding
the
large
number
of
greeks
and
strangers
who
had
settled
there
the
ancient
religion
was
not
yet
driven
out
of
the
delta
and
he
dedicated
it
to
the
god
in
a
greek
inscription
on
a
plate
of
gold
in
the
names
of
himself
and
berenicê
whom
he
called
his
wife
and
sister
she
is
also
called
the
sister
in
many
of
the
hieroglyphical
inscriptions
as
are
many
of
the
other
queens
of
the
ptolemies
who
were
not
so
related
to
their
husbands
this
custom
though
it
took
its
rise
in
the
egyptian
mythology
must
have
been
strengthened
by
the
marriages
of
philadelphus
and
some
of
his
successors
with
their
sisters
in
the
hieroglyphical
inscriptions
he
is
usually
called
by
phtah
the
god
of
memphis
an
addition
to
his
name
which
was
used
by
most
of
his
successors
during
this
century
the
greek
artists
in
egypt
as
indeed
elsewhere
adopted
in
their
style
an
affectation
of
antiquity
which
unless
seen
through
would
make
us
think
their
statues
older
than
they
really
are
they
sometimes
set
a
stiff
beard
upon
a
face
without
expression
or
arranged
the
hair
of
the
head
in
an
manner
and
while
making
the
drapery
fly
out
in
a
direction
opposed
to
that
of
the
figure
gave
to
it
formal
zigzag
lines
which
could
only
be
proper
if
it
were
hanging
down
in
quiet
at
other
times
while
they
gave
to
the
human
figure
all
the
truth
to
which
their
art
had
then
reached
they
yet
gave
to
the
drapery
these
stiff
zigzag
forms
illustration
ruins
of
sais
no
habit
of
mind
would
have
been
more
improving
to
the
alexandrian
character
than
a
respect
for
antiquity
but
this
respect
ought
to
be
shown
in
a
noble
rivalry
in
trying
to
surpass
those
who
have
gone
before
them
and
not
as
in
this
manner
by
copying
their
faults
hieroglyphics
seem
to
have
flourished
in
their
more
ancient
style
and
forms
under
the
generous
patronage
of
the
ptolemies
in
the
time
of
the
egyptian
kings
of
lower
egypt
we
find
new
grammatical
endings
to
the
nouns
and
more
letters
used
to
spell
each
word
than
under
the
kings
of
thebes
but
on
comparing
the
hieroglyphics
of
the
ptolemies
with
the
others
we
find
that
in
these
and
some
other
points
they
are
more
like
the
older
writings
under
the
kings
of
thebes
than
the
newer
under
the
kings
of
saïs
but
while
the
egyptians
were
flattered
and
no
doubt
raised
in
moral
worth
by
their
taking
up
the
religious
feelings
of
the
country
and
throwing
aside
some
of
the
greek
habits
of
his
father
and
grandfather
euergetes
was
sowing
the
seeds
of
a
greater
change
than
he
could
himself
have
been
aware
of
it
was
by
greek
arms
and
arts
of
war
that
egypt
then
held
its
place
among
nations
and
we
shall
see
in
the
coming
reigns
that
while
the
court
became
more
asiatic
and
less
european
the
army
and
government
did
not
retain
their
former
characteristics
since
and
judæa
were
by
the
first
ptolemy
made
a
province
of
egypt
the
jews
had
lived
in
unbroken
tranquillity
and
with
very
little
loss
of
freedom
the
kings
of
egypt
had
allowed
them
to
govern
themselves
to
live
under
their
own
laws
and
choose
their
own
high
priest
but
they
required
of
them
the
payment
to
alexandria
of
a
yearly
tribute
part
of
this
was
the
sacred
of
half
a
shekel
or
about
sixteen
cents
for
every
male
above
the
age
of
twenty
which
by
the
mosaic
law
they
had
previously
paid
for
the
service
of
the
temple
this
is
called
in
the
gospels
the
didrachms
though
the
alexandrian
translators
of
the
bible
altering
the
sum
either
through
mistake
or
on
purpose
have
made
it
in
the
greek
pentateuch
only
half
a
didrachm
or
about
eight
cents
this
yearly
tribute
from
the
temple
the
high
priest
of
jerusalem
had
been
usually
allowed
to
collect
and
farm
but
in
the
latter
end
of
this
reign
the
high
priest
onias
a
weak
and
covetous
old
man
refused
to
send
to
alexandria
the
twenty
talents
or
fifteen
thousand
dollars
at
which
it
was
then
valued
when
euergetes
sent
athenion
as
ambassador
to
claim
it
and
even
threatened
to
send
a
body
of
troops
to
fetch
it
still
the
tribute
was
not
paid
notwithstanding
the
fright
of
the
jews
the
priest
would
not
part
with
his
money
on
this
joseph
the
nephew
of
onias
set
out
for
egypt
to
try
and
turn
away
the
anger
he
went
to
memphis
and
met
euergetes
riding
in
his
chariot
with
the
queen
and
athenion
the
ambassador
the
king
when
he
knew
him
begged
him
to
get
into
the
chariot
and
sit
with
him
and
joseph
made
himself
so
agreeable
that
he
was
lodged
in
the
palace
at
memphis
and
dined
every
day
at
the
royal
table
while
he
was
at
memphis
the
revenues
of
the
provinces
for
the
coming
year
were
put
up
to
auction
and
the
farmers
bid
eight
thousand
talents
or
six
million
dollars
for
the
taxes
of
phoenicia
and
samaria
joseph
then
bid
double
that
sum
and
when
he
was
asked
what
security
he
could
give
he
playfully
said
that
he
was
sure
that
euergetes
and
the
queen
would
willingly
become
bound
for
his
honesty
and
the
king
was
so
much
pleased
with
him
that
the
office
was
at
once
given
to
him
and
he
held
it
for
years
among
the
men
of
letters
who
at
this
time
taught
in
the
alexandrian
schools
was
aristophanes
the
grammarian
who
afterwards
held
the
office
of
head
of
the
museum
at
one
of
the
public
sittings
at
which
the
king
was
to
hear
the
poems
and
other
writings
of
the
pupils
read
and
by
the
help
of
seven
men
of
letters
who
sat
with
him
as
judges
was
to
give
away
honours
and
rewards
to
the
best
authors
one
of
the
chairs
was
empty
one
of
the
judges
happened
not
to
be
there
the
king
asked
who
should
be
called
up
to
fill
his
place
and
after
thinking
over
the
matter
the
six
judges
fixed
upon
aristophanes
who
had
made
himself
known
to
them
by
being
seen
daily
studying
in
the
public
library
when
the
reading
was
over
the
king
the
public
and
the
six
other
judges
were
agreed
upon
which
was
the
best
piece
of
writing
but
aristophanes
was
bold
enough
to
think
otherwise
and
he
was
able
by
means
of
his
great
reading
to
find
the
book
in
the
library
from
which
the
pupil
had
copied
the
greater
part
of
his
work
the
king
was
much
struck
with
this
proof
of
his
learning
and
soon
afterwards
made
him
keeper
of
the
library
which
he
had
already
so
well
used
aristophanes
followed
zenodotus
in
his
critical
efforts
to
mend
the
text
of
poems
he
also
invented
the
several
marks
by
which
grammarians
now
distinguish
the
length
and
tone
of
a
syllable
and
the
breathing
of
a
vowel
that
is
the
marks
for
long
and
short
and
the
accents
and
aspirate
the
last
two
after
his
time
were
always
placed
over
greek
words
and
are
still
used
in
printed
books
eratosthenes
of

the
inventor
of

geography
was
at
this
time
the
head

mathematical
school

credit
for
being
the
first
to
calculate
the
circumference
of
the
earth
by
means
of
his
theory
of
shadows
as
a
poet
he
wrote
a
description
of
the
constellations
he
also
wrote
a
history
of

to
correct
the
errors
of

what
most
strikes
us
with
wonder
and
regret
is
that
of
these
two
writers

who
wrote

who
understood
something
of
egyptian
neither
of
them
took
the
trouble
to
lay
open
to
their
readers
the
peculiarities
of
the
hieroglyphics
through
all
these
reigns
the
titles
and
praises

the
ptolemies
were
carved
upon
the

sacred
characters
these
two
histories
were

inscriptions
we
even
now
read
the
names
of
the
kings
which
they
mention
carved
on
the
statues
and
temples
and
yet
the
language
of
the
hieroglyphics
still
remained
unknown
beyond
the
class
of
priests
such
was
the
want
of
curiosity
on
the
part
of
the
greek
grammarians
of
alexandria
such
we
may
add
was
their
want
of
respect
for
the
philosophy
of
the
egyptians
and
we
need
no
stronger
proof
that
the
philosophers
of
the
museum
had
hitherto
borrowed
none
of
the
doctrines
of
the
priests

euergetes
at

lycon
of
troas
was
another
settler
in
alexandria
he
followed
strato
at
the
head
of
one
of
the
schools
in
the
museum
he
was
very
successful
in
bringing
up
the
young
men
who
needed
he
used
to
say
modesty
and
the
love
of
praise
as
a
horse
needs
bridle
and
spur
his
eloquence
was
so
pleasing
that
he
was
wittily
called
glycon
or
the
sweet
carneades
of
cyrene
at
the
same
time
held
a
high
place
among
philosophers
but
as
he
had
removed
to
athens
where
he
was
at
the
head
of
a
school
and
was
even
sent
to
rome
as
the
ambassador
of
the
athenians
we
must
not
claim
the
whole
honour
of
him
for
the
ptolemies
under
whom
he
was
born
it
is
therefore
enough
to
say
of
him
that
though
a
follower
of
plato
he
made
such
changes
in
the
opinions
of
the
academy
by
not
wholly
throwing
off
the
evidence
of
the
senses
that
his
school
was
called
the
new
academy
apollonius
who
was
born
at
alexandria
but
is
commonly
called
apollonius
rhodius
because
he
passed
many
years
of
his
life
at
rhodes
had
been
like
eratosthenes
a
hearer
of
callimachus
his
only
work
which
we
now
know
is
his
a
poem
on
the
voyage
of
jason
to
colchis
in
search
of
the
golden
fleece
it
is
a
regular
epic
poem
in
imitation
of
homer
and
like
other
imitations
it
wants
the
interest
which
hangs
upon
reality
of
manners
and
story
in
the
iliad
callimachus
showed
his
dislike
of
his
young
rival
by
hurling
against
him
a
reproachful
poem
in
which
he
speaks
of
him
under
the
name
of
an
ibis
this
is
now
lost
but
it
was
copied
by
ovid
in
his
poem
of
the
same
name
and
from
the
roman
we
can
gather
something
of
the
dark
and
learned
style
in
which
callimachus
threw
out
his
biting
reproaches
we
do
not
know
from
what
this
quarrel
arose
but
it
seems
to
have
been
the
cause
of
apollonius
leaving
alexandria
he
removed
to
rhodes
where
he
taught
in
the
schools
during
all
the
reign
of
philopator
till
he
was
recalled
by
epiphanes
and
made
librarian
of
the
museum
in
his
old
age
on
the
death
of
eratosthenes
lycophron
the
tragic
writer
lived
about
this
time
at
alexandria
and
was
one
of
the
seven
men
of
letters
sometimes
called
the
alexandrian
pleiades
though
writers
are
not
agreed
upon
the
names
which
fill
up
the
list
his
tragedies
are
all
lost
and
the
only
work
of
his
which
we
now
have
is
the
dark
and
muddy
poem
of
alcandra
or
cassandra
of
which
the
lines
most
striking
to
the
historian
are
those
in
which
the
prophetess
foretells
the
coming
greatness
of
rome
that
the
children
of
æneas
will
raise
the
crown
upon
their
spears
and
seize
the
sceptres
of
sea
and
land
lycophron
was
the
friend
of
menedemus
and
aratus
and
it
is
not
easy
to
believe
that
these
lines
were
written
before
the
overthrow
of
hannibal
in
italy
and
of
the
greek
phalanx
at
cynocéphale
or
that
one
who
was
a
man
in
the
reign
of
philadelphus
should
have
foreseen
the
triumph
of
the
roman
arms
these
words
must
have
been
a
later
addition
to
the
poem
to
improve
the
prophecy
conon
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
alexandrian
astronomers
has
left
no
writings
for
us
to
judge
of
his
merits
though
they
were
thought
highly
of
and
made
great
use
of
by
his
successors
he
worked
both
as
an
observer
and
an
inquirer
mapping
out
the
heavens
by
his
observations
and
collecting
the
accounts
of
the
eclipses
which
had
been
before
observed
in
egypt
he
was
the
friend
of
archimedes
of
syracuse
to
whom
he
sent
his
problems
and
from
whom
he
received
that
great
writings
in
return
apollonius
of
perga
came
to
alexandria
in
this
reign
to
study
mathematics
under
the
pupils
of
euclid
he
is
well
known
for
his
work
on
conic
sections
and
he
may
be
called
the
founder
of
this
study
the
greek
mathematicians
sought
after
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
and
followed
up
those
branches
of
their
studies
which
led
to
no
end
that
could
in
the
narrow
sense
be
called
useful
with
the
same
zeal
that
they
did
other
branches
out
of
which
sprung
the
great
practical
truths
of
mechanics
astronomy
and
geography
they
found
reward
enough
in
the
enlargement
of
their
minds
and
in
the
beauty
of
the
truth
learnt
alexandrian
science
gained
in
loftiness
of
tone
what
its
poetry
and
philosophy
wanted
thus
the
properties
of
the
ellipse
the
hyperbola
and
the
parabola
continued
to
be
studied
by
after
mathematicians
but
no
use
was
made
of
this
knowledge
till
nearly
two
thousand
years
later
when
kepler
crowned
the
labours
of
apollonius
with
the
great
discovery
that
the
paths
of
the
planets
round
the
sun
were
conic
sections
the
egyptians
however
made
great
use
of
mathematical
knowledge
particularly
in
the
irrigation
of
their
fields
and
archimedes
of
syracuse
who
came
to
alexandria
about
this
time
to
study
under
conon
did
the
country
a
real
service
by
his
invention
of
the
cochlea
or
the
more
distant
fields
of
the
valley
of
the
nile
rising
above
the
level
of
the
inundation
have
to
be
watered
artificially
by
pumping
out
of
the
canals
into
ditches
at
a
higher
level
for
this
work
archimedes
proposed
a
spiral
tube
twisting
round
an
axis
which
was
to
be
put
in
motion
either
by
the
hand
or
by
the
force
of
the
stream
out
of
which
it
was
to
pump
and
this
was
found
so
convenient
that
it
soon
became
the
machine
most
in
use
throughout
egypt
for
irrigation
but
while
we
are
dazzled
by
the
brilliancy
of
these
clusters
of
men
of
letters
and
science
who
graced
the
court
of
alexandria
we
must
not
shut
our
eyes
to
those
faults
which
are
always
found
in
works
called
forth
rather
by
the
fostering
warmth
of
royal
pensions
than
by
a
love
of
knowledge
in
the
people
the
and
philosophers
of
the
museum
were
not
likely
to
overtake
the
mighty
men
of
athens
in
its
best
days
who
had
studied
and
taught
without
any
pension
from
the
government
without
taking
any
fee
from
their
pupils
who
were
urged
forward
towards
excellence
by
the
love
of
knowledge
and
of
honour
who
had
no
other
aim
than
that
of
being
useful
to
their
hearers
and
looked
for
no
reward
beyond
their
love
and
esteem
in

alexandria
made
no
attempts
whatever
it
is
a
branch
of
literature
not
likely
to
flourish
under
a
despotic
monarchy
in
athens
it
fell
with
the
loss
of
liberty
and
demetrius
phalereus
was
the
last
of
the
real
athenian
orators
after
his
time
the
orations
were
declamations
written
carefully
in
the
study
and
coldly
spoken
in
the
school
for
the
instruction
of
the
pupils
and
wholly
wanting
in
fire
and
genius
and
the
alexandrian
men
of
letters
forbore
to
copy
greece
in
its
lifeless
harangues
for
the
same
reasons
the
alexandrians
were
not
successful
in
history
a
species
of
writing
which
a
despot
requires
to
be
false
and
flattering
is
little
likely
to
flourish
and
hence
the
only
historians
of
the

were
chronologists

it
had
seen
three
kings
who
though
not

not

fit
to

many
of
his
boasted
victories
were
like
letters
written
in
the
sand
of
which
the
traces
were
soon
lost
yet
he
was
by
far
the
greatest
and
possibly
the
wisest
monarch
of
his
day
we
may
be
sure
that
in
these
prosperous
reigns
life
and
property
were
safe
and
justice
was
administered
fairly
by
judges
who
were
independent
of
the
crown
as
even
centuries
afterwards
we
find
that
it
was
part
of
a
oath
on
taking
office
that
if
he
were
ordered
by
the
king
to
do
what
was

he
would

though
trade

still
enriched

though
arts
and

did
not
quit
alexandria
we
have
from
this
time
forward
to
mark
the
growth
only
of
vice
and
luxury
and
to
measure
the
wisdom
of
ptolemy
soter
by
the
length
of
time
that
his
laws
and
institutions
were
able
to
bear
up
against
the
misrule
and
folly
of
his
descendants
ptolemy
the
eldest
son
of
euergetes
inherited
the
crown
of
his
forefathers
but
none
of
the
great
qualities
by
which
they
had
won
and
guarded
it
he
was
then
about
years
old
his
first
act
was
to
call
together
his
council
and
to
ask
their
advice
about
putting
to
death
his
mother
berenicê
and
his
brother
magas
their
crime
was
the
being
too
much
liked
by
the
army
and
the
council
was
called
upon
to
say
whether
it
would
be
safe
to
have
them
killed
cleomenes
the
banished
king
of
sparta
who
was
one
of
the
council
alone
raised
his
voice
against
their
murder
and
wisely
said
that
the
throne
would
be
still
safer
if
there
were
more
brothers
to
stand
between
the
king
and
the
daring
hopes
of
a
traitor
the
minister
sosibius
on
the
other
hand
said
that
the
mercenaries
could
not
be
trusted
while
magas
was
alive
but
cleomenes
remarked
to
him
that
more
than
three
thousand
of
them
were
peloponnesians
and
that
they
would
follow
him
sooner
than
they
would
follow
magas
berenicê
and
magas
were
however
put
to
death
but
the
speech
of
cleomenes
was
not
forgotten
if
his
popularity
with
the
mercenaries
could
secure
their
allegiance
he
could
when
he
chose
make
them
rebel
from
that
time
he
was
treated
rather
as
a
prisoner
than
as
a
friend
and
by
his
but
incautious
observation
he
lost
all
chance
of
being
helped
to
regain
his
kingdom
nothing
is
known
of
the
death
of
euergetes
the
late
king
and
there
is
no
proof
that
it
was
by
unfair
means
but
when
his
son
began
a
cruel
and
wicked
reign
by
putting
to
death
his
mother
and
brother
and
by
taking
the
name
of
philopator
or
the
world
seems
to
have
thought
that
he
was
the
murderer
of
his
father
and
had
taken
this
name
to
throw
a
cloak
over
the
deed
by
this
murder
of
his
brother
and
by
the
minority
both
of
antiochus
king
of
syria
and
of
philip
king
of
macedonia
philopator
found
himself
safe
from
enemies
either
at
home
or
abroad
and
he
gave
himself
up
to
a
life
of
thoughtlessness
and
pleasure
the
army
and
fleet
were
left
to
go
to
ruin
and
the
foreign
provinces
which
had
hitherto
been
looked
upon
as
the
bulwarks
of
egypt
were
only
but
the
throne
rested
on
the
virtues
of
his
forefathers
and
it
was
not
till
his
death
that
it
was
found
to
have
been
undermined
by
his
own
follies
and
vice
egypt
had
been
governed
by
kings
of
more
than
usual
wisdom
for
above
one
hundred
years
and
was
at
the
very
height
of
its
power
when
philopator
came
to
the
throne
he
found
himself
master
of
ethiopia

of

along

and

the
unwilling
obedience
of
distant
provinces
usually
costs
more
than
it
is
worth
but
many
of
these
possessions
across
the
mediterranean
had
put
themselves
willingly
into
the
power
of
his
predecessors
for
the
sake
of
their
protection
and
they
cost
little
more
than
a
message
to
warn
off
invaders
egypt
was
the
greatest
naval
power
in
the
world
having
the
command
of
the
sea
and
the
whole
of
the
coast
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
mediterranean
on
the
death
of
euergetes
the
happiness
of
the
people
came
to
an
end
the
first
trouble
arose
from
the
loose
and
vicious
habits
of
the
new
king
and
was
an
attempt
made
upon
his
life
by
cleomenes
who
found
the
palace
in
alexandria
had
now
become
a
prison
the
spartan
took
advantage
of
the
being
at
canopus
to
escape
from
his
guards
and
to
raise
a
riot
in
alexandria
but
not
being
able
to
gain
the
citadel
and
seeing
that
disgrace
and
death
must
follow
upon
his
failure
he
stabbed
himself
with
his
own
dagger
the
kingdom
of
syria
after
being
humbled
by
ptolemy
euergetes
had
risen
lately
under
the
able
rule
of
antiochus
son
of
seleucus
callinicus
he
was
a
man
possessed
of
abilities
of
a
high
order
his
energy
and
courage
soon
recovered
from
egypt
the
provinces
that
syria
had
before
lost
and
afterwards
gained
for
him
the
name
of
antiochus
the
great
he
made
himself
master
of
the
city
of
damascus
by
a
stratagem
soon
after
this
seleucia
the
capital
which
had
been
taken
by
euergetes
was
retaken
by
antiochus
or
rather
given
up
to
him
by
treachery
theodotus
also
the
alexandrian
governor
of
delivered
up
to
him
that
province
and
antiochus
marched
southward
and
had
taken
tyre
and
ptolemaïs
before
the
egyptian
army
could
be
brought
into
the
field
there
he
gained
forty
ships
of
war
of
which
twenty
were
decked
vessels
with
four
banks
of
oars
and
the
others
smaller
he
then
marched
towards
egypt
and
on
his
way
learned
that
ptolemy
was
at
memphis
on
his
arrival
at
pelusium
he
found
that
the
place
was
strongly
guarded
and
that
the
garrison
had
opened
the
from
the
neighbouring
lake
and
thereby
spoiled
the
fresh
water
of
all
the
neighbourhood
he
therefore
did
not
lay
siege
to
that
city
but
seized
many
of
the
open
towns
on
the
east
side
of
the
nile
on
this
philopator
roused
himself
from
his
idleness
and
got
together
his
forces
against
the
coming
danger
his
troops
consisted
of
greeks
egyptians
and
mercenaries
to
the
total
of

men
and
elephants
or
one
elephant
to
every
thousand
men
which
was
the
number
usually
allowed
to
the
armies
about
this
time
but
before
this
army
reached
pelusium
antiochus
had
led
back
his
forces
to
winter
in
seleucia
the
next
spring
antiochus
again
marched
towards
egypt
with
an
army
of
thousand
foot
six
thousand
horse
and
one
hundred
and
two
elephants
philopator
led
his
whole
forces
to
the
frontier
to
oppose
his
march
and
met
the
syrian
army
near
the
village
of
raphia
the
border
town
between
egypt
and
palestine
arsinoë
his
queen
and
sister
rode
with
him
on
horseback
through
the
ranks
and
called
upon
the
soldiers
to
fight
for
their
wives
and
children
at
first
the
egyptians
seemed
in
danger
of
being
beaten
as
the
armies
approached
one
another
the
ethiopian
elephants
trembled
at
the
very
smell
of
the
indian
elephants
and
shrunk
from
engaging
with
beasts
so
much
larger
than
themselves
on
the
charge
the
left
wing
of
each
army
was
routed
as
was
often
the
case
among
the
greeks
when
from
too
great
a
trust
in
the
shield
every
soldier
kept
moving
to
the
right
and
thus
left
the
left
wing
uncovered
but
before
the
end
of
the
day
the
invading
army
was
defeated
and
though
some
of
the
egyptian
officers
treacherously
left
their
posts
and
carried
their
troops
over
to
antiochus
yet
the
syrian
army
was
wholly
routed
and
arsinoë
enjoyed
the
knowledge
and
the
praise
of
having
been
the
chief
cause
of
her
success
the
king
in
gratitude
sacrificed
to
the
gods
the
unusual
offering
of
four
elephants
by
this
victory
philopator
regained
and
there
he
spent
three
months
he
then
made
a
hasty
and
if
we
judge
his
reasons
rightly
we
must
add
a
disgraceful
treaty
with
the
enemy
that
he
might
the
sooner
get
back
to
his
life
of
ease
before
going
home
he
passed
through
jerusalem
where
he
gave
thanks
and
sacrificed
to
the
hebrew
god
in
the
temple
of
the
jews
and
being
struck
with
the
beauty
of
the
building
asked
to
be
shown
into
the
inner
room
in
which
were
kept
the
ark
of
the
covenant
rod
that
budded
and
the
golden
pot
of
manna
with
the
tables
of
the
covenant
the
priests
told
him
of
their
law
by
which
every
stranger
every
jew
and
every
priest
but
the
high
priest
was
forbidden
to
pass
beyond
the
second
veil
but
philopator
roughly
answered
that
he
was
not
bound
by
the
jewish
laws
and
ordered
them
to
lead
him
into
the
holy
of
holies
the
city
was
thrown
into
alarm
by
this
wickedness
the
streets
were
filled
with
men
and
women
in
despair
the
air
was
rent
with
shrieks
and
cries
and
the
priests
prayed
to
javeh
to
guard
his
own
temple
from
the
stain
the
mind
however
was
not
to
be
changed
the
refusal
of
the
priests
only
strengthened
his
wish
and
all
struggle
was
useless
while
the
court
of
the
temple
was
filled
with
greek
soldiers
but
says
the
jewish
historian
the
prayer
of
the
priests
was
heard
the
king
fell
to
the
ground
in
a
fit
like
a
reed
broken
by
the
wind
and
was
carried
out
speechless
by
his
friends
and
generals
on
his
return
to
egypt
he
showed
his
hatred
of
the
nation
by
his
treatment
of
the
jews
in
alexandria
he
made
a
law
that
they
should
lose
the
rank
of
macedonians
and
be
enrolled
among
the
class
of
egyptians
he
ordered
them
to
have
their
bodies
marked
with
pricks
in
the
form
of
an
ivy
leaf
in
honour
of
bacchus
and
those
who
refused
to
have
this
done
were
outlawed
or
forbidden
to
enter
the
courts
of
justice
the
king
himself
had
an
ivy
leaf
marked
with
pricks
upon
his
forehead
from
which
he
received
the
nickname
of
gallus
this
custom
of
marking
the
body
had
been
forbidden
in
the
levitical
law
it
was
not
known
among
the
kopts
but
must
always
have
been
in
use
among
the
lower
egyptians
it
was
used
by
the
arab
prisoners
of
ramses
and
is
still
practiced
among
the
egyptian
arabs
of
the
present
day
he
also
ordered
the
jews
to
sacrifice
on
the
pagan
altars
and
many
of
them
were
sent
up
to
alexandria
to
be
punished
for
rebelling
against
his
decree
their
resolution
however
or
as
their
historian
asserts
a
miracle
from
heaven
changed
the
mind
they
expected
to
be
trampled
to
death
in
the
hippodrome
by
furious
elephants
but
after
some
delay
they
were
released
unhurt
the
history
of
their
escape
however
is
more
melancholy
than
the
history
of
their
danger
no
sooner
did
the
persecution
cease
than
they
turned
with
pharisaical
cruelty
against
their
weaker
brethren
who
had
yielded
to
the
storm
and
they
put
to
death
three
hundred
of
their
countrymen
who
in
the
hour
of
danger
had
yielded
to
the
threats
of
punishment
and
complied
with
the
ceremonies
required
of
them
the
egyptians
who
when
the
persians
were
conquered
by
alexander
could
neither
help
nor
hinder
the
greek
army
and
who
when
they
formed
part
of
the
troops
under
the
first
ptolemy
were
uncounted
and
unvalued
had
by
this
time
been
armed
and
disciplined
like
greeks
and
in
the
battle
of
raphia
the
egyptian
phalanx
had
shown
itself
not
an
unworthy
rival
of
the
macedonians
by
this
success
in
war
and
by
their
hatred
of
their
vicious
and
cruel
king
the
egyptians
were
now
for
the
first
time
encouraged
to
take
arms
against
the
greek
government
the
egyptian
phalanx
murmured
against
their
greek
officers
and
claimed
their
right
to
be
under
an
egyptian
general
but
history
has
told
us
nothing
more
of
the
rebellion
than
that
it
was
successfully
put
down
the
greeks
were
still
the
better
soldiers
the
ships
built
by
philopator
were
more
remarkable
for
their
unwieldy
size
their
luxurious
and
costly
furniture
than
for
their
fitness
for
war
one
was
four
hundred
and
twenty
feet
long
and
feet
wide
with
forty
banks
of
oars
the
longest
oars
were
feet
long
and
weighted
with
lead
at
the
handles
that
they
might
be
the
more
easily
moved
this
huge
ship
was
to
be
rowed
by
four
thousand
rowers
its
sails
were
to
be
shifted
by
four
hundred
sailors
and
three
thousand
soldiers
were
to
stand
in
ranks
upon
deck
there
were
seven
beaks
in
front
by
which
it
was
to
strike
and
sink
the
ships
of
the
enemy
the
royal
barge
in
which
the
king
and
court
moved
on
the
quiet
waters
of
the
nile
was
nearly
as
large
as
this
ship
of
war
it
was
three
hundred
and
thirty
feet
long
and
feet
wide
it
was
fitted
up
with
staterooms
and
private
rooms
and
was
nearly
sixty
feet
high
to
the
top
of
the
royal
awning
a
third
ship
which
even
surpassed
these
in
its
fittings
and
ornaments
was
given
to
philopator
by
hiero
king
of
syracuse
it
was
built
under
the
care
of
archimedes
and
its
timbers
would
have
made
sixty
triremes
beside
baths
and
rooms
for
pleasures
of
all
kinds
it
had
a
library
and
astronomical
instruments
not
only
for
navigation
as
in
modern
ships
but
for
study
as
in
an
observatory
it
was
a
ship
of
war
and
had
eight
towers
from
each
of
which
were
to
be
thrown
at
the
enemy
by
six
men
its
machines
like
modern
cannons
could
throw
stones
of
three
hundred
pounds
weight
and
arrows
of
eighteen
feet
in
length
it
had
four
anchors
of
wood
and
eight
of
iron
it
was
called
the
ship
of
syracuse
but
after
it
had
been
given
to
philopator
it
was
known
by
the
name
of
the
ship
of
alexandria
in
the
second
year
of
reign
the
romans
began
that
long
and
doubtful
war
with
hannibal
called
the
second
punic
war
and
in
the
twelfth
year
of
this
reign
they
sent
ambassadors
to
renew
their
treaty
of
peace
with
egypt
they
sent
as
their
gifts
robes
of
purple
for
philopator
and
arsinoë
and
for
philopator
a
chair
of
ivory
and
gold
which
was
the
usual
gift
of
the
republic
to
friendly
kings
the
alexandrians
kept
upon
good
terms
both
with
the
romans
and
the
carthaginians
during
the
whole
of
the
punic
wars
when
the
city
of
rhodes
which
had
long
been
joined
in
close
friendship
with
egypt
was
shaken
by
an
earthquake
that
threw
down
the
colossal
statue
of
apollo
together
with
a
large
part
of
the
city
walls
and
docks
philopator
was
not
behind
the
other
friendly
kings
and
states
in
his
gifts
and
help
he
sent
to
his
brave
allies
a
large
sum
of
money
with
grain
timber
and
hemp
on
the
birth
of
his
son
and
heir
in
ambassadors
crowded
to
alexandria
with
gifts
and
messages
of
joy
but
they
were
all
thrown
into
the
shade
by
hyrcanus
the
son
of
joseph
who
was
sent
from
jerusalem
by
his
father
and
who
brought
to
the
king
one
hundred
boys
and
one
hundred
girls
each
carrying
a
talent
of
silver
philopator
soon
after
the
birth
of
this
his
only
child
employed
philammon
at
the
bidding
of
his
mistress
to
put
to
death
his
queen
and
sister
arsinoë
or
eurydice
as
she
is
sometimes
called
he
had
already
forgotten
his
rank
and
his
name
ennobled
by
the
virtues
of
three
generations
and
had
given
up
his
days
and
nights
to
vice
and
riot
he
kept
in
his
pay
several
fools
or
as
they
were
then
called
who
were
the
chosen
companions
of
his
meals
and
he
was
the
first
who
brought
eunuchs
into
the
court
of
alexandria
his
mistress
agathoclea
her
brother
agathocles
and
their
mother
oenanthe
held
him
bound
by
those
chains
which
clever
worthless
and
selfish
favourites
throw
around
the
mind
of
a
weak
and
debauched
king
agathocles
who
never
left
his
side
was
his
adviser
in
matters
of
business
or
pleasure
and
governed
alike
the
army
the
courts
of
justice
and
the
women
thus
was
spent
a
reign
of
seventeen
years
during
which
the
king
had
never
but
once
when
he
met
antiochus
in
battle
roused
himself
from
his
life
of
sloth
the
misconduct
and
vices
of
agathocles
raised
such
an
outcry
against
him
that
philopator
without
giving
up
the
pleasure
of
his
company
was
forced
to
take
away
from
him
the
charge
of
receiving
the
taxes
that
high
post
was
then
given
to
tlepolemus
a
young
man
whose
strength
of
body
and
warlike
courage
had
made
him
the
darling
of
the
soldiers
another
charge
given
to
tlepolemus
was
that
of
watching
over
the
supply
and
price
of
corn
in
alexandria
the
wisest
statesmen
of
old
thought
it
part
of
a
duty
to
take
care
that
the
people
were
fed
and
seem
never
to
have
found
out
that
it
would
be
better
done
if
the
people
were
left
to
take
care
of
themselves
they
thought
it
moreover
a
piece
of
wise
policy
or
at
any
rate
of
clever
kingcraft
to
keep
down
the
price
of
food
in
the
capital
at
the
cost
of
the
rest
of
the
kingdom
and
even
sometimes
to
give
a
monthly
fixed
measure
of
corn
to
each
citizen
by
such
means
as
these
the
crowd
of
poor
and
restless
citizens

larger
in
alexandria
than
it
otherwise
would
have
been
and
the
danger
of
riot
which
it
was
meant
to
lessen
was
every
year
increased
sosibius
had
made
himself
more
hated
than
agathocles
he
had
been
the
ready
tool
in
all
his

he
had
been
stained

at

reproached
with

and
lastly

crimes
sosibius
was
forced
by
the
soldiers
to
give
up

what
in
modern
language
would
be
called
the
great
seal
of
the
kingdom

badge
of
office
by
which
egypt
was
governed
but
the
world
soon
saw
that
a
body
of
luxurious
mercenaries
were
as
little
able
to
choose
a
wise
statesman
as
the
king
had
been
illustration
temple
of

with
all
his
vices
philopator
had
yet
inherited
the
love
of
letters
which
has
thrown
so
bright
a
light
around
the
whole
of
the
family
and
to
his
other
luxuries

sometimes
added

invited
to
alexandria
sphærus
who
had
been
the
pupil
of
zeno
one
day
when
sphærus
was
dining
with
the
king
he
said
that
a
wise
man
should
never
guess
but
only
say
what
he
knows
philopator
wishing
to
tease
him
ordered
some
waxen
pomegranates
to
be
handed
to
him
and
when
sphærus
bit
one
of
them
he
laughed
at
him
for
guessing
that
it
was
real
fruit
but
the
stoic
answered
that
there
are
many
cases
in
which
our
actions
must
be
guided
by
what
seems
probable

a

it

alexandria
to
tell
them
of
the
death
of
philopator
and
to
show
them
their
young
king
he
went
to
the
meeting
followed
by
his
sister
agathoclea
and
the
young
ptolemy
afterwards
called
epiphanes
he
began
his
speech
men
of
macedonia
as
this
mixed
body
of
greeks
and
jews
was
always
called
he
wiped
his
eyes
in
grief
and
showed
them
the
new
king
who
had
been
trusted
he
said
by
his
father
to
the
motherly
care
of
agathoclea
and
to
their
loyalty
he
then
accused
tlepolemus
of
aiming
at
the
throne
and
brought
forward
a
creature
of
his
own
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
charge
but
his
voice
was
soon
drowned
in
the
loud
murmurs
of
the
citizens
they
had
smarted
too
long
under
his
tyranny
and
were
too
well
acquainted
with
his
falsehoods
to
listen
to
anything
that
he
could
say
against
his
rival
besides
tlepolemus
had
the
charge
of
supplying
alexandria
with
corn
a
duty
which
was
more
likely
to
gain
friends
than
the
pandering
to
the
vices
of
their
hated
tyrant
agathocles
soon
saw
that
his
life
was
in
danger
and
he
left
the
meeting
and
returned
to
the
palace
in
doubt
whether
he
should
seek
for
safety
in
flight
or
boldly
seize
the
power
which
he
was
craftily
aiming
at
and
rid
himself
of
his
enemies
by
their
murder
while
he
was
wasting
these
precious
minutes
in
doubt
the
streets
were
filled
with
groups
of
men
and
of
boys
who
always
formed
a
part
of
the
mobs
of
alexandria
they
sullenly
but
loudly
gave
vent
to
their
hatred
of
the
minister
and
if
they
had
but
found
a
leader
they
would
have
been
in
rebellion
in
a
little
while
the
crowd
moved
off
to
the
tents
of
the
macedonians
to
learn
their
feelings
on
the
matter
and
then
to
the
quarters
of
the
mercenaries
both
of
which
were
close
to
the
palace
and
the
mixed
mob
of
armed
and
unarmed
men
soon
told
the
fatal
news
that
the
soldiers
were
as
angry
as
the
citizens
but
they
were
still
without
a
leader
they
sent
messengers
to
tlepolemus
who
was
not
in
alexandria
and
he
promised
that
he
would
soon
be
there
but
perhaps
he
no
more
knew
what
to
do
than
his
guilty
rival
agathocles
in
his
doubt
did
nothing
he
sat
down
to
supper
with
his
friends
perhaps
hoping
that
the
storm
might
blow
over
of
itself
perhaps
trusting
to
chance
and
to
the
strong
walls
of
the
palace
his
mother
oenanthe
ran
to
the
temple
of
ceres
and
proserpine
and
sat
down
before
the
altar
in
tears
believing
that
the
sanctuary
of
the
temple
would
be
her
best
safeguard
as
if
the
laws
of
heaven
which
had
never
bound
her
would
bind
her
enemies
it
was
a
festal
day
and
the
women
in
the
temple
who
knew
nothing
of
the
storm
which
had
risen
in
the
forum
within
these
few
hours
came
forward
to
comfort
her
but
she
answered
them
with
curses
she
knew
that
she
was
hated
and
would
soon
be
despised
and
she
added
the
savage
prayer
that
they
might
have
to
eat
their
own
children
the
riot
did
not
lessen
at
sunset
men
women
and
boys
were
moving
through
the
streets
all
night
with
torches
the
crowds
were
greatest
in
the
stadium
and
in
the
theatre
of
bacchus
but
most
noisy
in
front
of
the
palace
agathocles
was
awakened
by
the
noise
and
in
his
fright
ran
to
the
bedroom
of
the
young
ptolemy
and
distrusting
the
palace
walls
hid
himself
with
his
own
family
the
king
and
two
or
three
guards
in
the
underground
passage
which
led
from
the
palace
to
the
theatre
the
night
however
passed
off
without
any
violence
but
at
daybreak
the
murmurs
became
louder
and
the
thousands
in
the
palace
yard
called
for
the
young
king
by
that
time
the
greek
soldiers
joined
the
mob
and
then
the
guards
within
were
no
longer
to
be
feared
the
gates
were
soon
burst
open
and
the
palace
searched
the
mob
rushed
through
the
halls
and
lobbies
and
learning
where
the
king
had
fled
hastened
to
the
underground
passage
it
was
guarded
by
three
doors
of
iron
grating
but
when
the
first
was
beaten
in
aristomenes
was
sent
out
to
offer
terms
of
surrender
agathocles
was
willing
to
give
up
the
young
king
his
misused
power
his
wealth
and
estates
he
asked
only
for
his
life
but
this
was
sternly
refused
and
a
shout
was
raised
to
kill
the
messenger
and
aristomenes
the
best
of
the
ministers
whose
only
fault
was
the
being
a
friend
of
agathocles
and
the
having
named
his
little
daughter
agathoclea
would
certainly
have
been
killed
upon
the
spot
if
somebody
had
not
reminded
them
that
they
wanted
to
send
back
an
answer
agathocles
seeing
that
he
could
hold
out
no
longer
then
gave
up
the
little
king
who
was
set
upon
a
horse
and
led
away
to
the
stadium
amid
the
shouts
of
the
crowd
there
they
seated
him
on
the
throne
and
while
he
was
crying
at
being
surrounded
by
strange
faces
the
mob
loudly
called
for
revenge
on
the
guilty
ministers
sosibius
the
somatophylax
the
son
of
the
former
general
of
that
name
seeing
no
other
way
of
stopping
the
fury
of
the
mob
and
the
sobs
asked
him
if
the
enemies
of
his
mother
and
of
his
throne
should
be
given
up
to
the
people
the
child
of
course
answered
without
understanding
what
was
meant
and
on
that
they
let
sosibius
take
him
to
his
own
house
to
be
out
of
the
uproar
agathocles
was
soon
led
out
bound
and
was
stabbed
by
those
who
two
days
before
would
have
felt
honoured
by
a
look
from
him
agathoclea
and
her
sister
were
then
brought
out
and
lastly
oenanthe
their
mother
was
dragged
away
from
the
altar
of
ceres
and
proserpine
some
bit
them
some
struck
them
with
sticks
some
tore
their
eyes
out
her
body
was
torn
to
pieces
and
her
limbs
scattered
among
the
crowd
to
such
lengths
of
madness
and
angry
cruelty
was
the
alexandrian
mob
sometimes
driven
in
the
meanwhile
some
of
the
women
called
to
mind
that
philammon
who
had
been
employed
in
the
murder
of
arsinoë
had
within
those
three
days
come
to
alexandria
and
they
made
a
rush
at
his
house
the
doors
quickly
gave
way
before
their
blows
and
he
was
killed
upon
the
spot
by
clubs
and
stones
his
little
son
was
strangled
by
these
raging
mothers
and
his
wife
dragged
naked
into
the
street
and
there
torn
to
pieces
thus
died
agathocles
and
all
his
family
and
the
care
of
the
young
king
then
fell
to
sosibius
and
to
aristomenes
who
had
already
gained
a
high
character
for
wisdom
and
firmness
while
egypt
was
thus
without
a
government
philip
of
macedonia
and
antiochus
of
syria
agreed
to
divide
the
foreign
provinces
between
them
and
antiochus
marched
against
and
phoenicia
the
guardians
of
the
young
ptolemy
sent
against
him
an
army
under
scopas
the
ætolian
who
was
at
first
successful
but
was
afterwards
beaten
by
antiochus
at
paneas
in
the
valley
of
the
jordan
three
and
twenty
miles
above
the
lake
of
tiberias
and
driven
back
into
egypt
in
these
battles
the
jews
who
had
not
forgotten
the
ill
treatment
that
they
had
received
from
philopator
joined
antiochus
after
having
been
under
the
government
of
egypt
for
exactly
one
hundred
years
and
in
return
antiochus
released
jerusalem
from
all
taxes
for
three
years
and
afterwards
from
of
the
taxes
he
also
sent
a
large
sum
of
money
for
the
service
of
the
temple
and
released
the
elders
priests
scribes
and
singing
men
from
all
taxes
for
the
future
the
alexandrian
statesmen
had
latterly
shown
themselves
in
their
foreign
policy
very
unworthy
pupils
of
ptolemy
soter
and
philadelphus
who
had
both
ably
trimmed
the
balance
of
power
between
the
several
successors
of
alexander
but
even
had
they
been
wiser
they
could
hardly
before
the
end
of
the
second
punic
war
have
foreseen
that
the
romans
would
soon
be
their
most
dangerous
enemies
the
overthrow
of
hannibal
however
might
perhaps
have
opened
their
eyes
but
it
was
then
too
late
egypt
was
too
weak
to
form
an
alliance
with
macedonia
or
syria
against
the
romans
about
this
time
also
the
romans
sent
to
alexandria
to
inform
the
king
that
they
had
conquered
hannibal
and
brought
to
a
close
the
second
punic
war
and
to
thank
him
for
the
friendship
of
the
egyptians
during
that
long
and
doubtful
struggle
of
eighteen
years
when
so
many
of
their
nearer
neighbours
had
joined
the
enemy
they
begged
that
if
the
senate
felt
called
upon
to
undertake
a
war
against
philip
who
though
no
friend
to
the
egyptians
had
not
yet
taken
arms
against
them
it
might
cause
no
breach
in
the
friendship
between
the
king
of
egypt
and
the
romans
in
answer
to
this
embassy
the
alexandrians
rushing
to
their
own
destruction
sent
to
rome
a
message
which
was
meant
to
place
the
kingdom
wholly
in
the
hands
of
the
senate
it
was
to
beg
them
to
undertake
the
guardianship
of
the
young
ptolemy
and
the
defence
of
the
kingdom
against
philip
and
antiochus
during
his
childhood
the
romans
in
return
gave
the
answer
they
sent
ambassadors
to
antiochus
and
philip
to
order
them
to
make
no
attack
upon
egypt
on
pain
of
falling
under
the
displeasure
of
the
senate
and
they
sent
marcus
lepidus
to
alexandria
to
accept
the
offered
prize
and
to
govern
the
foreign
affairs
of
the
kingdom
under
the
modest
name
of
tutor
to
the
young
king
this
high
honour
was
afterwards
mentioned
by
lepidus
with
pride
upon
the
coins
struck
when
he
was
consul
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
this
reign
they
have
the
city
of
alexandria
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
the
title
of
to
the
king
with
the
figure
of
the
roman
in
his
toga
putting
the
diadem
on
the
head
of
the
young
ptolemy
the
haughty
orders
of
the
senate
at
first
had
very
little
weight
with
the
two
kings
antiochus
conquered
phoenicia
and
and
he
was
then
met
by
a
second
message
from
the
senate
who
no
longer
spoke
in
the
name
of
their
ward
the
young
king
of
egypt
but
ordered
him
to
give
up
to
the
roman
people
the
states
which
he
had
seized
and
which
belonged
they
said
to
the
romans
by
the
right
of
war
illustration
roman
coin
issued
under
ptolemy
on
this
antiochus
made
peace
with
egypt
by
a
treaty
in
which
he
betrothed
his
daughter
cleopatra
to
the
young
ptolemy
and
added
the
disputed
provinces
of
phoenicia
and
as
a
dower
which
were
to
be
given
up
to
egypt
when
the
king
was
old
enough
to
be
married
philip
marched
against
athens
and
the
other
states
of
greece
which
had
heretofore
held
themselves
independent
and
in
alliance
with
egypt
and
when
the
athenian
embassy
came
to
alexandria
to
beg
for
the
usual
help
ministers
felt
themselves
so
much
in
the
power
of
the
senate
that
they
sent
to
rome
to
ask
whether
they
should
help
their
old
friends
the
athenians
against
philip
the
common
enemy
or
whether
they
should
leave
it
to
the
romans
to
help
them
and
these
haughty
republicans
who
wished
all
their
allies
to
forget
the
use
of
arms
who
valued
their
friends
not
for
their
strength
but
for
their
obedience
sent
them
word
that
the
senate
did
not
wish
them
to
help
the
athenians
and
that
the
roman
people
would
take
care
of
their
own
allies
the
alexandrians
looked
upon
the
proud
but
unlettered
romans
only
as
friends
as
allies
who
asked
for
no
pay
who
took
no
reward
who
fought
only
for
ambition
and
for
the
glory
of
their
country
soon
after
this
the
battle
of
cynocephake
in
thessaly
was
fought
between
philip
and
the
romans
in
which
the
romans
lost
only
seven
hundred
men
while
as
many
as
eight
thousand
macedonians
were
left
dead
upon
the
field
this
battle
though
only
between
rome
and
macedonia
must
not
be
passed
unnoticed
in
the
history
of
egypt
where
the
troops
were
armed
and
disciplined
like
macedonians
as
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
world
had
seen
the
macedonian
phalanx
routed
and
in
flight
before
any
troops
not
so
armed
the
phalanx
was
a
body
of
spearsmen
in
such
close
array
that
each
man
filled
a
space
of
only
one
square
yard
the
spear
was
seven
yards
long
and
when
held
in
both
hands
its
point
was
five
yards
in
front
of
the
breast
there
were
sixteen
ranks
of
these
men
and
when
the
first
five
ranks
lowered
their
spears
the
point
of
the
fifth
spear
was
one
yard
in
front
of
the
foremost
rank
the
romans
on
the
other
hand
fought
in
open
ranks
with
one
yard
between
each
or
each
man
filled
a
space
of
four
square
yards
and
in
a
charge
would
have
to
meet
ten
macedonian
spears
but
then
the
roman
soldiers
went
into
battle
with
much
higher
feelings
than
those
of
the
greeks
in
rome
arms
were
trusted
only
to
the
citizens
to
those
who
had
a
country
to
love
a
home
to
guard
and
who
had
some
share
in
making
the
laws
which
they
were
called
upon
to
obey
but
the
greek
armies
of
macedonia
egypt
and
syria
were
made
up
either
of
natives
who
bowed
their
necks
in
slavery
or
of
mercenaries
who
made
war
their
trade
and
rioted
in
its
lawlessness
both
of
whom
felt
that
they
had
little
to
gain
from
victory
and
nothing
to
lose
by
a
change
of
masters
moreover
the
warlike
skill
of
the
romans
was
far
greater
than
any
that
had
yet
been
brought
against
the
greeks
it
had
lately
been
improved
in
their
wars
with
hannibal
the
great
master
of
that
science
they
saw
that
the
phalanx
could
use
its
whole
strength
only
on
a
plain
that
a
wood
a
bog
a
hill
or
a
river
were
difficulties
which
this
close
body
of
men
could
not
always
overcome
a
charge
or
a
retreat
equally
lessened
its
force
the
phalanx
was
meant
to
stand
the
charge
of
others
the
romans
therefore
chose
their
own
time
and
their
own
ground
they
loosened
their
ranks
and
widened
their
front
avoided
the
charge
and
attacked
the
greeks
at
the
side
and
in
the
rear
and
the
fatal
discovery
was
at
last
made
that
the
macedonian
phalanx
was
not
unconquerable
and
that
closed
ranks
were
only
strong
against
barbarians
this
news
must
have
been
heard
by
every
statesman
of
egypt
and
the
east
with
alarm
the
were
now
their
equals
and
were
soon
to
be
their
masters
but
to
return
to
egypt
it
was
as
we
have
seen
a
country
governed
by
men
of
a
foreign
race
neither
the
poor
who
tilled
the
land
nor
the
rich
who
owned
the
estates
had
any
share
in
the
government
they
had
no
public
duty
except
to
pay
taxes
to
their
greek
masters
who
walked
among
them
as
superior
beings
marked
out
for
fitness
to
rule
by
greater
skill
in
the
arts
both
of
war
and
peace
the
greeks
by
their
arms
or
rather
by
their
military
discipline
had
enforced
obedience
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
and
as
they
had
at
the
same
time
checked
lawless
violence
made
life
and
property
safe
and
left
industry
to
enjoy
a
large
share
of
its
own
earnings
this
obedience
had
been
for
the
most
part
granted
to
them
willingly
they
had
even
trusted
the
egyptians
with
arms
but
none
are
able
to
command
unless
they
are
at
the
same
time
able
to
obey
the
alexandrians
were
now
almost
in
rebellion
against
their
young
king
and
his
ministers
and
the
greek
government
no
longer
gave
the
usual
advantages
in
return
for
the
obedience
which
it
tyrannically
enforced
confusion
increased
each
year
during
the
childhood
of
the
fifth
ptolemy
to
whom
alexandrian
flattery
gave
the
title
of
epiphanes
or
the
illustrious
the
egyptian
phalanx
had
in
the
last
reign
shown
signs
of
disobedience
and
at
length
it
broke
out
in
open
rebellion
the
discontented
party
strengthened
themselves
in
the
busirite
nome
in
the
middle
of
the
delta
and
fortified
the
city
of
lycopolis
against
the
government
and
a
large
supply
of
arms
and
warlike
stores
which
they
there
got
together
proved
the
length
of
time
that
they
had
been
preparing
for
resistance
the
royal
troops
laid
siege
to
the
city
in
due
form
they
surrounded
it
with
mounds
and
ditches
they
dammed
up
the
bed
of
the
river
on
each
side
of
it
and
being
helped
by
a
rise
in
the
nile
which
was
that
year
greater
than
usual
they
forced
the
rebels
to
surrender
on
the
promise
that
they
should
be
spared
but
ptolemy
was
not
bound
by
promises
he
was
as
false
and
cruel
as
he
was
weak
the
rebels
were
punished
and
many
of
the
troubles
in
his
reign
arose
from
his
discontented
subjects
not
being
able
to
rely
upon
his
word
the
rich
island
of
cyprus
also
which
had
been
left
by
philopator
under
the
command
of
polyerates
showed
some
signs
of
wishing
to
throw
off
the
egyptian
yoke
but
polyerates
was
true
to
his
trust
and
though
the
ministers
were
almost
too
weak
either
to
help
the
faithful
or
punish
the
treacherous
he
not
only
saved
the
island
for
the
minor
but
when
he
gave
up
his
government
to
ptolemy
of
megalopolis
he
brought
to
the
royal
treasury
at
alexandria
a
large
sum
from
the
revenues
of
his
province
by
this
faithful
conduct
he
gained
great
weight
in
the
alexandrian
councils
till
corrupted
by
the
poisonous
habits
of
the
place
he
gave
way
to
luxury
and
vice
about
the
same
time
scopas
who
had
lately
led
back
to
alexandria
his
ætolian
mercenaries
so
far
showed
signs
of
discontent
and
disobedience
that
the
minister
aristomenes
began
to
suspect
him
of
planning
resistance
to
the
government
scopas
was
greedy
of
money
nothing
would
satisfy
his
avarice

even
this
did
not
content
him
aristomenes
observed
that
he
was
collecting
his
friends
for
some
secret
purpose
and
in
frequent
consultation
with
them
he
therefore
summoned
him
to
the
presence
and
being
prepared
for
his
refusal
he
sent
a
large
force
to
fetch
him
fearing
that
the
mercenaries
might
support
their
general
aristomenes
had
even
ordered
out
the
elephants
and
prepared
for
battle

blow
came
upon

unexpectedly
no
resistance
was
made

was

aristomenes

did
not
immediately
venture
to
punish
him
but
wisely
summoned
the
ætolian
ambassadors
and
the
chiefs
of
the
mercenaries
to
his
trial
and
as
they
made
no
objection
he
then
had
him
poisoned
in
prison
no
sooner
was
this
rebellion
crushed
than
the
council
took
into
consideration
the
propriety
of
declaring
the
minority
at
an
end
as
the
best
means
of
the
royal
authority
and
they
thereupon
determined
shortly
to
celebrate
his
anacleteria
or
the
grand
ceremony
of
exhibiting
him
to
the
people
as
their
monarch
though
he
wanted
some
years
of
the
legal
age
and
accordingly
in
the
ninth
year
of
his
reign
the
young
king
was
crowned
with
great
pomp
at
memphis
the
ancient
capital
of
the
kingdom
on
this
occasion
he
came
to
memphis
by
barge
in
grand
state
where
he
was
met
by
the
priests
of
upper
and

egypt
and
crowned
in
the
temple
of
phtah
with
the
double
crown

after
the
ceremony

made

of

the

orders
that
the
statue
of

shall
be
worshipped
in

temple

be
carried
out
in

that
the

is
to
be
carved
at
the
foot
of
every
statue
of
the
king
in
sacred
in
common
and
in
greek
writing
it
is
to
this
stone
with
its
three
kinds
of
letters
and
to
the
skill
and
industry
of
thomas
young
and
of
the
french
scholar
champollion
that
we
now
owe
our
knowledge
of
hieroglyphics
the
greeks
of
alexandria
and
after
them
the
romans
who
might
have
learned
how
to
read
this
kind
of
writing
if
they
had
wished
seem
never
to
have
taken
the
trouble
it
fell
into
disuse
on
the
rise
of
christianity
in
egypt
and
it
was
left
for
an
englishman
to
unravel
the
hidden
meaning
after
it
had
been
forgotten
for
nearly
thirteen
centuries
the
preamble
of
this
decree
tells
us
also
that
during
the
minority
of
the
king
the
taxes
were
lessened
the
crown
debtors
were
forgiven
those
who
were
found
in
prison
charged
with
crimes
against
the
state
were
released
the
allowance
from
government
for
upholding
the
splendour
of
the
temples
was
continued
as
was
the
rent
from
land
belonging
to
the
priests
the
or
rather
the
coronation
money
a
tax
paid
by
the
priests
to
the
king
on
the
year
of
his
coming
to
the
throne
which
was
by
custom
allowed
to
be
less
than
what
the
law
ordered
was
not
increased
the
priests
were
relieved
from
the
heavy
burden
of
making
a
yearly
voyage
to
do
homage
at
alexandria
there
was
a
stop
put
to
the
impressing
men
for
the
navy
which
had
been
felt
as
a
great
cruelty
by
an
inland
people
whose
habits
and
religion
alike
made
them
hate
the
sea
and
this
was
a
boon
which
was
the
more
easily
granted
as
the
navy
of
alexandria
which
was
built
in
foreign
dockyards
and
steered
by
foreign
pilots
had
very
much
fallen
off
in
the
reign
of
philopator
the
duties
on
linen
cloth
which
was
the
chief
manufacture
of
the
kingdom
and
after
grain
the
chief
article
exported
were
lessened
the
priests
who
manufactured
linen
for
the
own
use
probably
for
the
clothing
of
the
army
and
the
sails
for
the
navy
were
not
called
upon
for
so
large
a
part
of
what
they
made
as
before
and
the
royalties
on
the
other
linen
manufactories
and
the
duties
on
the
samples
or
patterns
both
of
which
seem
to
have
been
unpaid
for
the
whole
of
the
eight
years
of
the
minority
were
wisely
forgiven
all
the
temples
of
egypt
and
that
of
apis
at
memphis
in
particular
were
enriched
by
his
gifts
in
which
pious
actions
in
grateful
remembrance
of
their
former
benefactor
and
with
a
marked
slight
to
philopator
they
said
that
he
was
following
the
wishes
of
his
grandfather
the
god
euergetes
from
this
decree
we
gain
some
little
insight
into
the
means
by
which
the
taxes
were
raised
under
the
ptolemies
and
we
also
learn
that
they
were
so
new
and
foreign
that
they
had
no
egyptian
word
by
which
they
could
speak
of
them
and
therefore
borrowed
the
greek
word
history
gives
us
many
examples
of
kings
who
like
epiphanes
gained
great
praise
for
the
mildness
and
weakness
of
the
government
during
their
minorities
aristomenes
the
minister
who
had
governed
egypt
for
epiphanes
fully
deserved
that
trust
while
the
young
king
looked
up
to
him
as
a
father
the
country
was
well
governed
and
his
orders
obeyed
but
as
he
grew
older
his
good
feelings
were
weakened
by
the
pleasures
which
usually
beset
youth
and
royalty
the
companions
of
his
vices
gained
that
power
over
his
mind
which
aristomenes
lost
and
it
was
not
long
before
this
wise
tutor
and
counsellor
was
got
rid
of
the
king
weary
perhaps
with
last
debauchery
had
one
day
fallen
asleep
when
he
should
have
been
listening
to
the
speech
of
a
foreign
ambassador
aristomenes
gently
shook
him
and
awoke
him
his
flatterers
when
alone
with
him
urged
him
to
take
this
as
an
affront
if
said
they
it
was
right
to
blame
the
king
for
falling
asleep
when
worn
out
with
business
and
the
cares
of
state
it
should
have
been
done
in
private
and
not
in
the
face
of
the
whole
court
so
aristomenes
was
put
to
death
by
being
ordered
to
drink
poison
epiphanes
then
lost
that
love
of
his
people
which
the
wisdom
of
the
minister
had
gained
for
him
and
he
governed
the
kingdom
with
the
cruelty
of
a
tyrant
rather
than
with
the
legal
power
of
a
king

was
of
the

age
as
himself
and
had
been
brought
up
as
his
playfellow
passed
him
in
the
manly
virtues
of
his
age
and
earned
the
praise
of
the
country
for
setting
him
a
good
example
and
checking
him
in
his
career
of
vice
in
the
thirteenth
year
of
his
reign

the
young
king
reached
the
age
of
eighteen
antiochus
the
great
sent
his
daughter
cleopatra
into
egypt
and
the
marriage
which
had
been
agreed
upon
six
years
before
was
then
carried
into
effect
and
the
provinces
of
phoenicia
and

which
had
been
promised
as

dower
were
in

handed
over
to
the

cleopatra
was
a
woman
of
strong
mind

hoped
that
by

of
the
power
which
she
would
have
over
the
weaker
mind
of
epiphanes
he
should
gain
more
than
he
lost
by
giving
up
and
phoenicia
but
she
acted
the
part
of
a
wife
and
a
queen
and
instead
of
betraying
her
husband
into
the
hands
of
her
father
she
was
throughout
the
reign
his
wisest
and
best
counsellor
antiochus
seems
never
to
have
given
up
his
hold
upon
the
provinces
which
had
been

countries
which
had
been
kept

six
years

cleopatra
had
been
betrothed
was
broken

she
was
married
the
war
was
still
going

neither
hired

fought
as
such
the
thirst
for
gold
had
not
yet
become
the
strongest
feeling
in

sent

money

promise

should
be
able

pay

was
getting
together

playfully
answered
that

his
joke
was
taken
in

were
afraid
of

taxes

fresh

died
in

year
of
his
age
after
a
reign
of
years

the

unmanned
the

in
disobedience
the

empty

the
whole
framework

out

just
before

death
he
had
sent
to
the
achaians
to
offer
to
send
ten

their

the
historian
to
whom
we
owe
so
much
of
our
knowledge
of
these
reigns
although
he
had
not
yet
reached
the
age
called
for
by
the
greek
law
was
sent
by
the
achaians
as
one
of
the
ambassadors
with
his
father
to
return
thanks
but
before
they
had
quitted
their
own
country
they
were
stopped
by
the
news
of
the
death
of
epiphanes
those
who
took
away
the
life
of
the
king
seem
to
have
had
no
thoughts
of
mending
the
form
of
government
nor
any
plan
by
which
they
might
lessen
the
power
of
his
successor
it
was
only
one
of
those
outbreaks
of
private
vengeance
which
have
often
happened
in
unmixed
monarchies
where
men
are
taught
that
the
only
way
to
check
the
tyranny
is
by
his
murder
and
the
little
notice
that
was
taken
of
it
by
the
people
proves
their
want
of
public
virtue
as
well
as
of
political
wisdom

the
alexandrians
had
sadly
felt
the
want

to
the

they
were
now
glad
to
copy
the
customs

left
behind

though
still
a
child
mounted

able
guardianship
of

took

the
age
at
which
his
minority
ceased
his
coronation
was
celebrated
with
great
pomp
ambassadors
from
several
foreign
states
were
sent
to
egypt
to
wish
the
king
joy
to
do
honour
to
the
day
and
to
renew

treaties
of

caius

and

others
were
sent
from

apollonius
the
son
of
mnestheus
was
sent
from
judæa
and
we
may
regret
with
polybius
that
he
himself
was
not
able
to
form
part
of
the
embassy
then
sent
from
the
achaians
that
he
might
have
seen
the
costly
and
curious
ceremony
and
given
us
an
account
of
it
while
cleopatra
lived
she
had
been
able
to
keep
her
son
at
peace
with
her
brother
antiochus

upon
her
death
leneus
and
the
eunuch
eulaius
who
then
had
the
care
of
the
young
king
sought
to
reconquer
and
they
embroiled
the
country
in
a
war
at
a
time
when
weakness
and
decay
might
have
been
seen
in
every
part
of
the
army
and
navy
and
when
there
was
the
greatest
need
of
peace
and
phoenicia
had
been
given
to
ptolemy
epiphanes
as
his
dower
but
when
philometor
seemed
too
weak
to
grasp
them
antiochus
denied
that
his
father
had
ever
made
such
a
treaty
and
got
ready
to
march
against
egypt
as
the
easiest
way
to
guard
by
this
time
the
statesmen
of
egypt
ought
to
have
learned
the
mistake
in
their
foreign
policy
by
widening
their
frontier
they
always
weakened
it
they
should
have
fortified
the
passes
between
the
red
sea
and
the
mediterranean
not
cities
in
asia
when
antiochus
entered
egypt
he
was
met
at
pelusium
by
the
army
of
philometor
which
he
at
once
routed
in
a
pitched
battle
the
whole
of
egypt
was
then
in
his
power
he
marched
upon
memphis
with
a
small
force
and
seized
it
without
having
to
strike
a
blow
helped
perhaps
by
the
plea
that
he
was
acting
on
behalf
of
his
nephew
ptolemy
philometor
who
then
fell
into
his
hands
on
this
the
younger
ptolemy
the
brother
of
philometor
who
was
with
his
sister
cleopatra
in
alexandria
and
was
about
fifteen
years
old
declared
himself
king
and
sent
ambassadors
to
rome
to
ask
for
help
against
antiochus
and
taking
the
name
of
the
most
popular
of
his
forefathers
he
called
himself
euergetes
he
is
however
better
known
in
history
as
ptolemy
physcon
or
a
nickname
which
was
afterwards
given
to
him
when
he
had
grown
fat
and
unwieldy
from
the
diseases
of
luxury
comanus
and
cineas
were
the
chief
advisers
of
the
young
euergetes
and
in
their
alarm
they
proposed
to
send
the
foreign
ambassadors
to
meet
the
invader
on
his
march
from
memphis
and
to
plead
for
peace
this
task
the
ambassadors
kindly
undertook
there
were
then
in
alexandria
two
embassies
from
the
achaians
one
to
renew
the
treaty
of
peace
and
one
to
settle
the
terms
of
the
coming
wrestling
match
there
were
there
three
embassies
from
athens
one
with
gifts
from
the
city
one
about
the
panathenaic
games
and
one
about
the
celebration
of
the
mysteries
there
was
also
an
embassy
from
miletus
and
one
from
clazomenæ
on
the
day
of
their
arrival
at
memphis
antiochus
feasted
these
numerous
ambassadors
in
grand
state
and
on
the
next
day
gave
them
an
audience
but
their
arguments
for
peace
carried
no
weight
with
him
and
he
denied
that
his
father
antiochus
the
great
had
ever
given
as
a
dower
with
his
daughter
cleopatra
to
epiphanes
to
gain
time
he
promised
the
ambassadors
that
he
would
give
them
an
answer
as
soon
as
his
own
ambassadors
returned
from
alexandria
and
in
the
meanwhile
he
carried
his
army
down
the
nile
to
naucratis
and
thence
marched
to
the
capital
to
begin
the
siege
antiochus
however
was
defeated
in
his
first
assault
upon
alexandria
and
finding
that
he
should
not
soon
be
able
to
bring
the
siege
to
an
end
he
sent
off
an
embassy
to
rome
with
a
hundred
and
fifty
talents
of
gold
fifty
as
a
present
to
the
senate
and
the
rest
to
be
divided
among
the
states
of
greece
whose
help
he
might
need
at
the
same
time
also
an
embassy
from
the
rhodians
arrived
in
the
port
of
alexandria
to
attempt
to
restore
peace
to
the
country
of
their
old
allies
antiochus
received
the
rhodian
ambassadors
in
his
tent
but
would
not
listen
to
the
long
speech
with
which
they
threatened
him
and
shortly
told
them
that
he
came
as
the
friend
of
his
elder
nephew
the
young
philometor
and
if
the
alexandrians
wished
for
peace
they
should
open
the
gates
to
their
rightful
king
antiochus
was
however
defeated
in
all
his
assaults
on
the
city
and
he
at
last
withdrew
his
army
and
returned
to
syria
he
left
euergetes
king
of
the
greeks
at
alexandria
and
philometor
at
memphis
king
of
the
rest
of
egypt
but
he
kept
pelusium
where
he
placed
a
strong
garrison
that
he
might
be
able
easily
to
egypt
whenever
he
chose
ptolemy
macron
the
alexandrian
governor
of
cyprus
added
to
the
troubles
of
the
country
by
giving
up
his
island
to
antiochus
but
he
met
with
the
usual
fate
of
traitors
he
was
badly
rewarded
and
when
he
complained
of
his
treatment
he
was
called
a
traitor
by
the
very
men
who
had
gained
by
his
treachery
and
he
poisoned
himself
in
the
bitterness
of
his
grief
antiochus
like
most
invaders
carried
off
whatever
treasure
fell
into
his
hands
egypt
was
a
sponge
which
had
not
lately
been
squeezed
and
his
court
and
even
his
own
then
shone
with
a
blaze
of
silver
and
gold
unknown
in
syria
before
this
inroad
into
egypt
by
these
acts
and
by
the
garrison
left
in
pelusium
the
eyes
of
philometor
were
opened
and
he
saw
that
his
uncle
had
not
entered
egypt
for
his
sake
but
to
make
it
a
province
of
syria
after
it
had
been
weakened
by
civil
war
he
therefore
wisely
forgave
his
rebellious
brother
and
sister
in
alexandria
and
sent
offers
of
peace
to
them
and
it
was
agreed
that
the
two
ptolemies
should
reign
together
and
turn
their
forces
against
the
common
enemy
it
was
most
likely
at
this
time
and
as
a
part
of
this
treaty
that
philometor
married
his
sister
cleopatra
it
was
mainly
by
her
advice
and
persuasion
that
the
quarrel
between
the
two
brothers
was
for
the
time
healed
on
this
treaty
between
the
brothers
the
year
was
called
the
twelfth
of
ptolemy
philometor
and
the
first
of
ptolemy
euergetes
and
the
public
deeds
of
the
kingdom
were
so
dated
the
next
year
antiochus
epiphanes
again
entered
egypt
claiming
the
island
of
cyprus
and
the
country
round
pelusium
as
the
price
of
his
forbearance
and
on
his
marching
forward
memphis
a
second
time
opened
its
gates
to
him
without
a
battle
he
came
down
by
slow
marches
towards
alexandria
and
crossed
the
canal
at
leucine
four
miles
from
the
city
there
he
was
met
by
the
roman
ambassadors
who
ordered
him
to
quit
the
country
on
his
hesitating
popilius
who
was
one
of
them
drew
a
circle
round
him
on
the
sand
with
his
stick
and
told
him
that
if
he
crossed
that
line
without
promising
to
leave
egypt
at
once
it
should
be
taken
as
a
declaration
of
war
against
rome
on
this
threat
antiochus
again
quitted
egypt
and
the
brothers
sent
ambassadors
to
rome
to
thank
the
senate
for
their
help
and
to
acknowledge
that
they
owed
more
to
the
roman
people
than
they
did
to
the
gods
or
to
their
forefathers
the
treaty
made
on
this
occasion
between
philometor
and
antiochus
was
written
by
heraclides
lembus
the
son
of
serapion
a
native
of
oxyrynchus
who
wrote
on
the
succession
of
the
philosophers
in
the
several
greek
schools
and
other
works
on
philosophy
but
whose
chief
work
was
a
history
named
the
lembeutic
history
four
years
afterwards
in
antiochus
epiphanes
died
and
the
jews
of
judæa
who
had
been
for
some
time
struggling
for
liberty
then
gained
a
short
rest
for
their
unhappy
country
judas
maccabæus
had
raised
his
countrymen
in
rebellion
against
the
foreigners
he
had
defeated
the
syrian
forces
in
several
battles
and
was
at
last
able
to
purify
the
temple
and
the
service
there
as
of
old
he
therefore
sent
to
the
jews
of
egypt
to
ask
them
to
join
their
hebrew
brethren
in
celebrating
the
feast
of
tabernacles
on
that
great
occasion
illustration
temple
of
hermonthis
the
unhappy
quarrels
between
the
egyptian
kings
soon
broke
out
again
and
as
the
party
of
euergetes
was
the
stronger
philometor
was
driven
from
his
kingdom
and
he
fled
to
rome
for
safety
and
for
help
he
entered
the
city
privately
and
took
up
his
lodgings
in
the
house
of
one
of
his
own
subjects
a
painter
of
alexandria
his
pride
led
him
to
refuse
the
offers
of
better
entertainment
which
were
made
to
him
by
demetrius
the
nephew
of
antiochus
who
like
himself
was
hoping
to
regain
his
kingdom
by
the
help
of
the
romans
the
kings
of
egypt
and
syria
the
two
greatest
kingdoms
in
the
world
were
at
the
same
time
asking
to
be
heard
at
the
bar
of
the
roman
senate
and
were
claiming
the
thrones
of
their
fathers
at
the
hands
of
men
who
could
make
and
unmake
kings
at
their
pleasure
as
soon
as
the
senate
heard
that
philometor
was
in
rome
they
lodged
him
at
the
cost
of
the
state
in
a
manner
becoming
his
high
rank
and
soon
sent
him
back
to
egypt
with
orders
that
euergetes
should
reign
in
cyrene
and
that
the
rest
of
the
kingdom
should
belong
to
philometor
this
happened
in
the
seventeenth
year
of
philometor
and
the
sixth
of
euergetes
which
was
the
last
year
that
was
named
after
the
two
kings
cassius
longinus
who
was
next
year
consul
at
rome
was
most
likely
among
the
ambassadors
who
replaced
philometor
on
the
throne
for
he
put
the
ptolemaic
eagle
and
thunderbolt
on
his
coins
as
though
to
claim
the
sovereignty
of
egypt
for
the
senate
to
these
orders
euergetes
was
forced
to
yield
but
the
next
year
he
went
himself
to
rome
to
complain
to
the
senate
that
they
had
made
a
very
unfair
division
of
the
kingdom
and
to
beg
that
they
would
add
the
island
of
cyprus
to
his
share
after
hearing
the
ambassadors
from
philometor
who
were
sent
to
plead
on
the
other
side
the
senate
granted
the
prayer
of
euergetes
and
sent
ambassadors
to
cyprus
with
orders
to
hand
that
island
over
to
euergetes
and
to
make
use
of
the
fleets
and
armies
of
the
republic
if
these
orders
were
disobeyed
euergetes
during
his
stay
in
rome
if
we
may
believe
plutarch
made
an
offer
of
marriage
to
cornelia
the
mother
of
the
gracchi
but
this
offer
of
a
throne
could
not
make
the
matron
quit
her
children
and
her
country
he
left
italy
with
the
roman
ambassadors
and
in
passing
through
greece
he
raised
a
large
body
of
mercenaries
to
help
him
to
wrest
cyprus
from
his
brother
as
it
would
seem
that
the
governor
faithful
to
his
charge
would
not
listen
to
the
commands
of
rome
but
the
ambassadors
had
been
told
to
conquer
cyprus
if
necessary
with
the
arms
of
the
republic
only
and
they
therefore
made
euergetes
disband
his
levies
they
sailed
for
alexandria
to
enforce
their
orders
upon
philometor
and
sent
euergetes
home
to
cyrene
philometor
received
the
roman
ambassadors
with
all
due
honours
he
sometimes
gave
them
fair
promises
and
sometimes
put
them
off
till
another
day
and
tried
to
spin
out
the
time
without
saying
either
yes
or
no
to
the
message
from
the
senate
euergetes
sent
to
alexandria
to
ask
if
they
had
gained
their
point
but
though
they
threatened
to
return
to
rome
if
they
were
not
at
once
obeyed
philometor
by
his
kind
treatment
and
still
kinder
words
kept
them
more
than
forty
days
longer
at
alexandria
at
last
the
roman
ambassadors
left
egypt
and
on
their
way
home
they
went
to
cyrene
to
let
euergetes
know
that
his
brother
had
disobeyed
the
orders
of
the
senate
and
would
not
give
up
cyprus
and
euergetes
then
sent
two
ambassadors
to
rome
to
beg
them
to
revenge
their
affronted
dignity
and
to
enforce
their
orders
by
arms
the
senate
of
course
declared
the
peace
with
egypt
at
an
end
and
ordered
the
ambassadors
from
philometor
to
quit
rome
within
five
days
and
sent
their
own
ambassadors
to
cyrene
to
tell
euergetes
of
their
decree
but
while
this
was
going
on
the
state
of
cyrene
had
risen
in
arms
against
euergetes
his
vices
and
cruelty
had
made
him
hated
they
had
gained
for
him
the
nicknames
of
kakergetes
or
and
physcon
or
and
while
wishing
to
gain
cyprus
he
was
in
danger
of
losing
his
own
kingdom
when
he
marched
against
the
rebels
he
was
beaten
and
wounded
either
in
the
battle
or
by
an
attack
upon
his
life
afterwards
and
his
success
was
for
some
time
doubtful
when
he
had
at
last
put
down
this
rising
he
sailed
for
rome
to
urge
his
complaints
against
philometor
upon
whom
he
laid
the
blame
of
the
late
rebellion
and
to
ask
for
help
the
senate
after
hearing
both
sides
sent
a
small
fleet
with
euergetes
not
large
enough
to
put
him
on
the
throne
of
cyprus
but
gave
him
what
they
had
before
refused
leave
to
levy
an
army
of
his
own
and
to
enlist
their
allies
in
greece
and
asia
as
mercenaries
under
his
standard
the
roman
troops
seem
not
to
have
helped
euergetes
but
he
landed
in
cyprus
with
his
own
mercenaries
and
was
there
met
by
philometor
who
had
brought
over
the
egyptian
army
in
person
euergetes
however
was
beaten
in
several
battles
he
was
soon
forced
to
shut
himself
up
in
the
city
of
lapitho
and
at
last
to
lay
down
his
arms
before
his
elder
brother
if
philometor
had
upon
this
put
his
brother
to
death
the
deed
would
have
seemed
almost
blameless
after
the
family
murders
already
related
in
this
history
but
with
a
goodness
of
heart
he
a
second
time
forgave
his
brother
all
that
had
passed
replaced
him
on
the
throne
of
cyrene
and
promised
to
give
him
his
daughter
in
marriage

heliopolis
we
are
not
told
whether
the
firmness
and
forgiving
mildness
of
philometor
had
turned
the
roman
senate
in
his
favour
but
their
troops
seemed
wanted
in
other
quarters
at
any
rate
they
left
off
trying
to
enforce
their
decree
philometor
kept
cyprus
and
sent
euergetes
a
yearly
gift
of
grain
from
alexandria
during
the
wars
in
syria
between
philometor
and
antiochus
epiphanes
at
the
beginning
of
this
reign
the
jews
were
divided
into
two
parties
one
favouring
the
egyptians
and
one
the
syrians
at
last
the
syrian
party
drove
their
enemies
out
of
jerusalem
and
onias
the
high
priest
with
a
large
body
of
jews
fled
to
egypt
there
they
were
well
received
by
philometor
who
allowed
them
to
dwell
in
the
neighbourhood
of
heliopolis
and
he
gave
them
leave
to
build
a
temple
and
ordain
priests
for
themselves
onias
built
his
temple
at
on
or
onion
a
city
about
miles
from
memphis
once
the
capital
of
the
district
of
heliopolis
it
was
on
the
site
of
an
old
egyptian
temple
of
the
goddess
pasht
which
had
fallen
into
disuse
and
decay
and
was
built
after
the
model
of
the
temple
of
jerusalem
though
by
the
jewish
law
there
was
to
be
no
second
temple
yet
onias
defended
himself
by
quoting
as
if
meant
for
his
own
times
the
words
of
isaiah
who
says
that
in
that
day
there
shall
be
an
altar
to
the
lord
in
the
midst
of
the
land
of
egypt
the
building
of
this
temple
and
the
celebrating
the
jewish
feasts
there
as
in
rivalry
to
the
temple
of
jerusalem
were
a
cause
of
quarrel
between
the
hebrew
and
the
greek
jews
they
each
altered
the
words
of
the
bible
to
make
it
speak
their
own
opinions
the
hebrew
bible
now
says
that
the
new
temple
was
in
the
city
of
destruction
and
the
greek
bible
says
that
it
was
in
the
city
of
righteousness
whereas
from
the
arabic
version
and
some
early
commentaries
it
seems
that
isaiah
was
speaking
of
the
city
of
heliopolis
where
there
had
been
of
old
an
altar
to
the
lord
the
leaders
of
the
greek
party
wished
the
jews
to
throw
aside
the
character
of
strangers
and
foreign
traders
to
be
at
home
and
to
become
owners
of
the
soil
not
laborious
work
says
the
son
of
sirach
husbandry
which
the
most
high
hath
about
the
same
time
the
jews
brought
before
ptolemy
as
a
judge
their
quarrel
with
the
samaritans
as
to
whether
according
to
the
law
of
moses
the
temple
ought
to
have
been
built
at
jerusalem
or
on
the
green
and
fertile
mount
gerizim
where
the
samaritans
built
their
temple
or
on
the
barren
white
crags
of
mount
ebal
where
the
hebrew
bible
says
that
it
should
be
built
and
as
to
which
nation
had
altered
their
copies
of
the
bible
in
the
chapter
of
deuteronomy
and
eighth
chapter
of
joshua
this
dispute
had
lately
been
the
cause
of
riots
and
rebellion
ptolemy
seems
to
have
decided
the
question
for
political
reasons
and
to
please
his
own
subjects
the
alexandrian
jews
and
without
listening
to
the
arguments
as
to
what
the
law
ordered
he
was
content
with
the
proof
that
the
temple
had
stood
at
jerusalem
for
about
eight
hundred
years
and
he
put
to
death
the
two
samaritan
pleaders
who
had
probably
been
guilty
of
some
outrage
against
the
jews
in
zeal
for
mount
gerizim
and
for
which
they
might
then
have
been
on
their
trial
onias
the
high
priest
was
much
esteemed
by
philometor
and
bore
high
offices
in
the
government
as
also
did
dositheus
another
jew
who
had
been
very
useful
in
helping
the
king
to
crush
a
rebellion
dositheus
called
himself
a
priest
and
a
levite
though
his
title
to
that
honour
seems
to
have
been
doubted
by
his
countrymen
he
had
brought
with
him
into
egypt
the
book
of
esther
written
in
greek
which
he
said
had
been
translated
out
of
the
hebrew
in
jerusalem
by
lysimachus
it
contained
some
additions
for
which
the
hebrew
has
never
been
brought
forward
and
which
are
now
placed
among
the
uncanonical
books
in
the
apocrypha
since
the
ptolemies
had
found
themselves
too
weak
to
hold
ethiopia
they
had
placed
a
body
of
soldiers
on
the
border
of
the
two
countries
to
guard
egypt
from
the
inroads
of
the
enemy
this
station
twelve
miles
to
the
south
of
syênê
had
by
degrees
grown
into
a
city
and
was
called
parembole
or
and
as
most
of
the
soldiers
were
greek
mercenaries
it
was
natural
that
the
temple
which
philometor
built
there
should
be
dedicated
in
the
greek
language
of
the
temples
hitherto
built
by
the
ptolemies
in
the
egyptian
cities
every
one
seems
to
have
had
the
name
and
titles
and
its
dedication
to
the
gods
carved
on
its
massive
portico
in
hieroglyphics
but
this
was
in
a
greek
city
and
it
was
dedicated
to
isis
and
serapis
on
behalf
of
philometor
and
his
queen
in
a
greek
inscription
illustration
temple
of
apollonopolis
philometor
also
built
a
temple
at
antseopolis
to
antaeus
a
god
of
whom
we
know
little
but
that
he
gave
his
name
to
the
city
and
another
to
aroëris
at
ombos
and
in
the
same
way
he
carved
the
dedications
on
the
porticoes
in
the
greek
language
this
custom
became
common
after
that
time
and
proves
both
the
lessened
weight
which
the
native
egyptians
bore
in
the
state
and
that
the
kings
had
forgotten
the
wise
rules
of
ptolemy
soter
in
regard
to
the
religious
feelings
of
the
people
they
must
have
been
greatly
shocked
by
this
use
of
foreign
writing
in
the
place
of
the
old
characters
of
the
country
which
from
having
been
used
in
the
temples
even
for
ages
beyond
the
reach
of
history
had
at
last
been
called
sacred
in
the
temple
at
antoopolis
we
note
a
marked
change
in
the
style
of
building
the
screen
in
front
of
the
great
portico
is
almost
removed
by
having
a
doorway
made
in
it
between
every
pair
of
columns
it
is
to
this
reign
also
that
we
seem
to
owe
the
great
temple
at
apollinopolis
magna
although
it
was
not
finished
till
one
or
two
reigns
later
it
is
one
of
the
largest
and
least
ruined
of
the
egyptian
temples
its
front
is
formed
of
two
huge
square
towers
with
sloping
sides
between
which
is
the
narrow
doorway
the
only
opening
in
its
massive
walls
through
this
the
worshipper
entered
a
spacious
courtyard
or
cloister
where
he
found
shade
from
the
sun
under
a
covered
walk
on
either
side
in
front
is
the
lofty
portico
with
six
large
columns
the
entrance
to
the
body
of
the
building
this
last
is
and
far
lower
than
the
grand
portico
which
hid
it
from
the
eyes
of
the
crowd
in
the
courtyard
the
staircases
in
the
towers
are
narrow
the
sacred
rooms
within
were
small
and
dark
with
only
a
glimmering
flame
here
and
there
before
an
altar
except
when
lighted
up
with
a
blaze
of
lamps
on
a
as
a
castle
it
must
have
had
great
strength
from
the
top
and
loopholes
of
the
two
towers
stones
and
darts
might
be
hurled
at
the
enemy
and
as
it
was
in
the
hands
of
the
egyptians
it
is
the
strongest
proof
that
they
were
either
not
distrusted
or
not
feared
by
their
greek
rulers
the
city
of
apollinopolis
stands
on
a
grand
and
lofty
situation
overlooking
the
river
and
the
valley
and
this
proud
temple
rising
over
all
can
only
have
been
planned
by
military
skill
as
a
fortress
to
command
the
whole
at
this
time
the
greeks
in
egypt
were
beginning
to
follow
the
custom
of
their
egyptian
brethren
to
take
upon
themselves
monastic
vows
and
to
shut
themselves
up
in
the
temples
in
religious
idleness
but
these
foreigners
were
looked
upon
with
jealousy
by
the
egyptian
monks
as
intruders
on
their
endowments
and
we
meet
with
a
petition
addressed
to
philometor
by
ptolemy
the
son
of
glaucias
a
monk
in
the
temple
of
serapis
at
memphis
who
styles
himself
a
macedonian
complaining
that
his
cell
had
been
violently
entered
and
himself
because
he
was
a
greek
and
reminding
the
king
that
last
year
when
the
king
visited
the
serapium
he
had
addressed
the
same
petition
to
him
through
the
bars
of
his
window
the
priests
in
temples
of
egypt
were
maintained
partly
by
their
own
estates
and
partly
by
the
offerings
of
the
pious
and
we
still
possess
a
deed
of
sale
made
in
this
reign
by
the
theban
priests
of
of
a
third
of
their
collections
for
the
dead
who
had
been
buried
in
thynabunum
the
libyan
suburb
of
thebes
this
sixth
share
of
the
collections
consisted
of
seven
or
eight
families
of
slaves
the
price
of
it
was
four
hundred
pieces
of
brass
the
bargain
was
made
in
the
presence
of
sixteen
witnesses
whose
names
are
given
and
the
deed
was
registered
and
signed
by
a
public
notary
in
the
city
of
thebes
the
custom
of
giving
offerings
to
the
priests
for
the
good
of
the
dead
would
seem
to
have
been
a
cause
of
some
wealth
to
the
temples
it
was
one
among
the
many
egyptian
customs
forbidden
by
the
law
of
moses
from
this
deed
of
sale
we
also
gain
some
knowledge
of
the
state
of
slavery
in
egypt
the
names
of
the
slaves
and
of
their
fathers
are
koptic
and
in
some
cases
borrowed
from
the
names
of
the
gods
hence
the
slaves
were
probably
of
the
same
religion
and
spoke
nearly
the
same
language
as
their
masters
they
sunk
into
that
low
state
rather
by
their
own
want
of
mind
than
by
their
power
in
each
case
the
slave
was
joined
in
the
same
lot
with
his
children
and
the
low
price
of
four
hundred
pieces
of
brass
perhaps
about
dollars
for
eight
families
or
even
if
it
be
meant
for
the
half
of
eight
families
proves
that
they
were
of
the
nature
of
serfs
and
that
the
master
either
by
law
or
custom
could
have
had
no
power
of
cruelly
overworking
them
on
the
other
hand
in
the
reign
of
philadelphus
the
prisoners
taken
in
battle
who
might
be
treated
with
greater
severity
were
ransomed
at
fifteen
dollars
each
we
see
by
the
monuments
that
there
were
also
a
few
negroes
in
the
same
unhappy
state
of
slavery
they
were
probably
not
treated
much
worse
than
the
lowest
class
of
those
born
on
the
soil
but
they
were
much
more
valuable
other
slaves
of
the
berber
race
were
brought
in
coasting
vessels
from
opone
on
the
incense
coast
near
to
the
island
of
dioscorides
aristarchus
who
had
been
the
tutor
of
euergetes
and
of
a
son
of
philometor
was
one
of
the
ornaments
of
this
reign
he
had
been
a
pupil
of
aristophanes
the
grammarian
and
had
then
studied
under
crates
at
pergamus
the
rival
school
to
alexandria
he
died
at
cyprus
whither
he
probably
withdrew
on
the
death
of
philometor
he
was
chiefly
known
for
his
critical
writings
in
which
his
opinions
of
poetry
were
thought
so
just
that
few
dared
to
disagree
with
them
and
his
name
soon
became
proverbial
for
a
critic
aristarchus
had
also
the
good
fortune
to
be
listened
to
in
his
by
one
whose
name
is
far
more
known
than
those
of
his
two
royal
pupils
moschus
of
syracuse
the
pastoral
poet
was
one
of
his
hearers
but
his
fame
must
not
be
claimed
for
alexandria
he
can
hardly
have
learned
from
the
critic
that
just
taste
by
which
he
joined
softness
and
sweetness
to
the
rude
plainness
of
the
doric
muse
indeed
in
this
he
only
followed
his
young
friend
bion
whose
death
he
so
beautifully
bewails
and
from
whose
poems
he
generously
owns
that
he
learned
so
much
it
may
be
as
well
to
add
that
the
lines
in
which
he
says
that
theocritus
who
had
been
dead
above
one
hundred
years
joined
with
him
in
his
sorrow
for
the
death
of
bion
are
later
additions
not
found
in
the
early
manuscripts
of
his
poems
from
our
slight
acquaintance
with
life
we
are
left
in
doubt
whether
he
accompanied
his
friend
moschus
to
the
court
of
alexandria
but
it
is
probable
that
he
did
in
his
beautiful
lamentation
for
the
death
of
adonis
we
have
an
imitation
of
the
melancholy
chant
of
the
egyptians
named
which
they
sang
through
the
streets
in
the
procession
on
the
feast
of
isis
when
the
crowd
joined
in
the
chorus
hapless
isis
osiris
is
no
the
tale
has
been
a
good
deal
changed
by
the
sicilian
muse
of
bion
but
in
the
boar
which
killed
adonis
we
have
the
wicked
typhon
as
carved
on
the
monuments
we
have
also
the
wound
in
the
thigh
and
the
consolations
of
the
priests
who
every
year
ended
their
mournful
song
with
advising
the
goddess
to
reserve
her
sorrow
for
another
year
when
on
the
return
of
the
festival
the
same
lament
would
be
again
celebrated
the
whole
poem
has
a
depth
and
earnestness
of
feeling
which
is
truly
egyptian
but
which
was
very
little
known
in
alexandria
to
the
alexandrian
grammarians
and
more
particularly
to
aristophanes
aristarchus
and
their
pupil
ammonius
we
are
indebted
for
our
present
copies
of
homer
these
critics
acted
like
modern
editors
each
publishing
an
edition
or
rather
writing
out
a
copy
which
was
then
in
the
museum
as
often
as
called
for
by
the
demands
of
the
purchasers
of
books
aristophanes
left
perhaps
only
one
such
copy
or
edition
while
aristarchus
in
his
efforts
to
correct
the
text
of
the
great
epic
poet
made
several
such
copies
these
were
in
the
hands
of
the
later
scholiasts
who
appealed
to
them
as
their
authority
and
ventured
to
make
no
further
alterations
we
therefore
now
read
the
iliad
and
odyssey
nearly
as
left
by
these
alexandrian
critics
they
no
doubt
took
some
liberties
in
altering
the
spelling
and
smoothing
the
lines
and
though
we
should
value
most
highly
a
copy
in
the
rougher
form
in
which
it
came
into
their
hands
yet
on
the
whole
we
must
be
great
gainers
by
their
labours
they
divided
the
iliad
and
odyssey
into
books
each
and
corrected
the
faulty
metres
but
one
of
their
chief
tasks
was
to
set
aside
or
put
a
mark
against
those
more
modern
lines
which
had
crept
into
the
ancient
poems
it
had
been
usual
to
call
every
old
verse
or
homeric
and
these
it
was
the
business
of
the
critic
to
mark
as
not
genuine
aristarchus
was
jocosely
said
to
have
called
every
line
spurious
which
he
did
not
like
but
everything
that
we
can
learn
of
him
leads
us
to
believe
that
he
executed
his
task
with
judgment
from
these
men
sprang
the
school
of
alexandrian
grammarians
who
for
several
centuries
continued
their
minute
and
often
unprofitable
studies
in
verbal
criticism
illustration
the
apotheosis
of
homer
these
were
the
palmy
days
of
criticism
never
before
or
since
have
critics
held
so
high
a
place
in
literature
the
world
was
called
upon
to
worship
and
do
honour
to
the
poet
but
chiefly
that
it
might
admire
the
skill
of
the
critic
who
could
name
the
several
sources
of
his
beauties
the
critic
now
ranked
higher
than
a
priest
at
the
foot
of
mount
parnassus
homer
was
lifted
to
the
skies
that
the
critic
might
stand
on
a
raised
pedestal
among
the
muses
such
seems
to
be
the
meaning
of
the
figures
on
the
upper
part
of
the
sculpture
called
the
apotheosis
of
homer
it
was
made
in
this
reign
and
at
the
foot
ptolemy
and
his
mother
in
the
characters
of
time
and
the
world
are
crowning
the
statue
of
the
poet
in
the
presence
of
ten
worshippers
who
represent
the
literary
excellences
which
shine
forth
in
his
poems
the
figures
of
the
iliad
and
odyssey
kneel
beside
his
seat
and
the
frogs
and
mice
creep
under
his
footstool
showing
that
the
latter
poem
was
already
written
and
called
the
work
of
homer
other
celebrities
who
flourished
under
the
fifth
ptolemy
were
pamphilius
an
alexandrian
physician
who
wrote
on
medical
plants
meander
a
poet
and
physician
who
studied
poisons
and
the
great
hipparchus
the
founder
of
mathematical
astronomy
hero
also
in
this
reign
invented
a
kind
of
primitive
illustration
rotating
steam
engine
these
men
and
their
contemporaries
were
in
the
habit
of
writing
their
scientific
observations
in
the
form
of
poetry
but
it
was
verse
without
earnestness
and
feeling
and
such
of
it
as
survives
is
valued
not
for
its
literary
qualities
or
charms
of
diction
but
for
the
it
throws
upon
the
manners
and
education
of
the
age
the
portrait
of
the
king
is
known
from
those
coins
which
bear
the
name
of
ptolemy
the
the
eagle
on
the
other
side
of
the
coins
has
a
phoenix
or
on
its
wing
or
by
its
side
which
may
be
supposed
to
mean
that
they
were
struck
in
phoenicia
we
have
not
before
met
with
the
title
of
on
the
coins
of
the
ptolemies
but
as
every
one
of
them
had
been
so
named
in
the
hieroglyphical
inscriptions
it
can
scarcely
be
called
new
when
philometor
quitted
the
island
of
cyprus
after
beating
his
brother
in
battle
he
left
archias
as
governor
who
entered
into
a
plot
to
give
it
up
to
demetrius
king
of
syria
for
the
sum
of
five
hundred
talents
but
the
plot
was
found
out
and
the
traitor
then
put
an
end
to
his
own
life
to
escape
from
punishment
and
by
this
treachery
of
demetrius
philometor
was
made
his
enemy
and
he
joined
attalus
king
of
pergamus
and
ariarathes
king
of
cappadocia
in
setting
up
alexander
balas
as
a
pretender
to
the
throne
of
syria
who
beat
demetrius
in
battle
and
put
him
to
death
philometor
two
years
afterwards
gave
his
elder
daughter
cleopatra
in
marriage
to
alexander
and
led
her
himself
to
ptolemaïs
or
acre
where
the
marriage
was
celebrated
with
great
pomp
but
even
in
ptolemaïs
the
city
in
which
alexander
had
been
so
covered
with
favours
philometor
was
near
falling
under
the
treachery
of
his
new
he
learned
that
a
plot
had
been
formed
against
his
life
by
ammonius
and
he
wrote
to
alexander
to
beg
that
the
traitor
might
be
given
up
to
justice
but
alexander
acknowledged
the
plot
as
his
own
and
refused
to
give
up
his
servant
on
this
philometor
recalled
his
daughter
and
turned
against
alexander
the
forces
which
he
had
led
into
syria
to
uphold
him
he
then
sent
to
the
young
demetrius
afterwards
called
nicator
the
son
of
his
late
enemy
to
offer
him
the
throne
and
wife
which
he
had
lately
given
to
alexander
balas
demetrius
was
equally
pleased
with
the
two
offers
philometor
then
entered
antioch
at
the
head
of
his
army
and
there
he
was
proclaimed
by
the
citizens
king
of
asia
and
egypt
but
with
a
forbearance
then
very
uncommon
he
called
together
the
council
of
the
people
and
refused
the
crown
and
persuaded
them
to
receive
demetrius
as
their
king
illustration
coin
of
ptolemy
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
alexander
balas
and
demetrius
nicator
each
in
his
turn
acknowledged
his
debt
to
the
king
of
egypt
by
putting
the
ptolemaic
eagle
on
his
coins
and
adjusting
them
to
the
egyptian
standard
of
weight
and
in
this
they
were
afterwards
followed
by
antiochus
the
son
of
demetrius
the
romans
on
the
other
hand
sometimes
used
the
same
eagle
in
boast
of
their
power
over
egypt
but
we
can
not
be
mistaken
in
what
was
meant
by
these
syrian
kings
who
none
of
them
when
their
coins
were
struck
were
seated
safely
on
the
throne
with
them
as
with
some
of
the
greek
cities
of
asia
minor
the
use
of
the
egyptian
eagle
on
the
coins
was
an
act
of
homage
philometor
and
demetrius
as
soon
as
the
latter
was
acknowledged
king
at
antioch
then
marched
against
alexander
routed
his
army
and
drove
him
into
arabia
but
in
this
battle
horse
was
frightened
by
the
braying
of
an
elephant
and
threw
the
king
into
the
ranks
of
the
enemy
and
he
was
taken
up
covered
with
wounds
he
lay
speechless
for
five
days
and
the
surgeons
then
endeavoured
to
cut
out
a
piece
of
the
broken
bone
from
his
skull
he
died
under
the
operation
but
not
before
the
head
of
alexander
had
been
brought
to
him
as
the
proof
of
his
victory
thus
fell
ptolemy
philometor
in
the
year
of
his
age
his
reign
began
in
trouble
before
he
reached
the
years
of
manhood
the
country
had
been
overrun
by
foreigners
and
torn
to
pieces
by
civil
war
but
he
left
the
kingdom
stronger
than
he
found
it
a
praise
which
he
alone
can
share
with
ptolemy
soter
he
was
alike
brave
and
mild
he
was
the
only
one
of
the
race
who
fell
in
battle
and
the
only
one
whose
hands
were
unstained
with
civil
blood
at
an
age
and
in
a
country
when
poison
and
the
dagger
were
too
often
the
means
by
which
the
authority
was
upheld
when
goodness
was
little
valued
and
when
conquests
were
thought
the
only
measure
of
greatness
he
spared
the
life
of
a
brother
taken
in
battle
he
refused
the
crown
of
syria
when
offered
to
him
and
not
only
no
one
of
his
friends
or
kinsmen
but
no
citizen
of
alexandria
was
put
to
death
during
the
whole
of
his
reign
we
find
grateful
inscriptions
to
his
honour
at
the
city
of
citium
in
cyprus
in
the
island
of
therse
and
at
methone
in
argolis
philometor
had
reigned
years
in
all
eleven
years
alone
partly
while
under
age
then
six
years
jointly
with
his
brother
euergetes
and
eighteen
more
alone
while
his
brother
reigned
in
cyrene
he
married
his
sister
cleopatra
and
left
her
a
widow
with
two
daughters
each
named
cleopatra
the
elder
daughter
we
have
seen
offered
to
euergetes
then
married
to
alexander
balas
and
lastly
to
demetrius
the
younger
daughter
afterwards
known
by
the
name
of
cleopatra
cocce
was
still
in
the
care
of
her
mother
he
had
most
likely
had
three
sons
one
perhaps
had
been
the
pupil
of
aristarchus
and
died
before
his
father
as
the
little
elegy
by
antipator
of
sidon
which
is
addressed
to
the
dead
child
on
the
grief
of
his
father
and
mother
would
seem
to
be
meant
for
a
son
of
philometor
a
second
son
was
murdered
and
a
third
lived
in
syria
on
the
death
of
philometor
his
widow
cleopatra
and
some
of
the
chief
men
of
alexandria
proclaimed
his
young
son
king
most
likely
under
the
name
of
ptolemy
eupator
but
euergetes
whose
claim
was
favoured
by
the
mob
marched
from
cyrene
to
alexandria
to
seize
the
crown
of
egypt
onias
the
jew
defended
the
city
for
cleopatra
but
a
peace
was
soon
made
by
the
help
of
thermus
the
roman
ambassador
and
on
this
the
gates
of
alexandria
were
opened
it
was
agreed
that
euergetes
should
be
king
and
marry
cleopatra
his
sister
and
his
widow
we
may
take
it
for
granted
that
one
article
of
the
treaty
was
that
her
son
should
reign
on
the
death
of
his
uncle
but
euergetes
forgetting
that
he
owed
his
own
life
to
philometor
and
also
disregarding
the
romans
who
were
a
party
to
the
treaty
had
the
boy
put
to
death
on
the
day
of
the
marriage
the
alexandrians
after
the
vices
and
murders
of
former
kings
could
not
have
been
much
struck
by
the
behaviour
of
euergetes
towards
his
family
but
he
was
not
less
cruel
towards
his
people
alexandria
which
he
had
entered
peaceably
was
handed
over
to
the
unbridled
cruelty
of
the
mercenaries
and
blood
flowed
in
every
street
the
anger
of
euergetes
fell
more
particularly
on
the
jews
for
the
help
which
they
had
given
to
cleopatra
and
he
threatened
them
with
utter
destruction
the
threat
was
not
carried
into
execution
but
such
was
the
alarm
that
they
celebrated
a
yearly
festival
in
alexandria
for
several
hundred
years
in
thankfulness
for
their
escape
from
it
the
population
of
the
city
who
looked
upon
it
less
as
a
home
than
as
a
place
of
trade
in
which
they
could
follow
their
callings
with
the
greatest
gain
seemed
to
quit
alexandria
as
easily
as
they
had
come
there
under
ptolemy
soter
and
euergetes
who
was
afraid
that
he
should
soon
be
left
to
reign
over
a
wilderness
made
new
laws
in
favour
of
trade
and
of
strangers
who
would
settle
there
in
the
lifetime
of
philometor
he
had
never
laid
aside
his
claim
to
the
throne
of
egypt
but
had
only
yielded
to
the
commands
of
rome
and
to
his
forces
and
he
now
numbered
the
years
of
his
reign
from
his
former
seizing
of
alexandria
he
had
reigned
six
years
with
his
brother
and
then
eighteen
years
in
cyrene
and
he
therefore
called
the
first
year
of
his
real
reign
the
in
the
next
year
he
went
to
memphis
to
be
crowned
and
while
the
pomps
and
rites
were
there
being
performed
his
queen
and
sister
bore
him
a
son
whom
from
the
place
and
to
please
the
people
he
named
memphites
but
his
queen
was
already
in
disgrace
and
some
of
those
very
friends
who
on
his
death
had
marched
with
him
against
alexandria
were
publicly
put
to
death
for
speaking
ill
of
his
mistress
irene
he
soon
afterwards
put
away
his
wife
and
married
her
younger
daughter
his
niece
cleopatra
cocce
the
divorced
cleopatra
was
allowed
to
keep
her
title
and
as
she
was
the
widow
of
the
late
king
she
held
a
rank
in
the
state
before
the
wife
of
the
reigning
king
thus
the
small
temple
of
hâthor
in
the
island
of
philæ
was
dedicated
to
the
goddess
in
the
name
of
king
ptolemy

of

him

with

pomp

received
him
with
all
the
honours
due
to
his
rank
and
the
whole
city
followed
him
in
crowds
through
the
streets
eager
to
catch
a
sight
of
the
conqueror
of
carthage
of
the
greatest
man
who
had
been
seen
in
alexandria
of
one
who
by
his
virtues
and
his
triumphs
had
added
a
new
glory
even
to
the
name
of
scipio
he
brought
with
him
as
his
friend
and
companion
in
the
case
of
a
modern
ambassador
we
should
say
as
his
chaplain
the
philosopher
pansetius
the
chief
of
the
stoics
who
had
gained
a
great
name
for
his
three
books
on
the
of
man
which
were
afterwards
copied
by
cicero
illustration
euergetes
showed
them
over
the
palace
and
the
treasury
but
though
the
romans
had
already
begun
to
run
the
race
of
luxury
in
which
the
egyptians
were
so
far
ahead
of
them
yet
scipio
who
held
to
the
old
fashions
and
plain
manners
of
the
republic
was
not
dazzled
by
mere
gold
and
purple
but
the
trade
of
alexandria
the
natural
harbour
the
forest
of
masts
and
the
lighthouse
the
only
one
in
the
world
surpassed
anything
that
his
mind
had
looked
for
he
went
by
boat
to
memphis
and
saw
the
rich
crops
on
either
bank
and
the
easy
navigation
of
the
nile
in
which
the
boats
were
sailing
up
the
river
by
the
force
of
the
wind
and
floating
down
by
the
force
of
the
stream
the
villages
on
the
river
side
were
large
and
thickly
set
each
in
the
bosom
of
its
own
grove
of
and
the
crowded
population
was
well
fed
and
well
clothed
the
roman
statesman
saw
that
nothing
was
wanting
but
a
good
government
to
make
egypt
what
it
used
to
be
the
greatest
kingdom
in
the
world
scipio
went
no
higher
than
memphis
the
buildings
of
upper
egypt
the
oldest
and
the
largest
in
the
world
could
not
draw
him
to
thebes
a
city
whose
trade
had
fallen
off
where
the
deposits
of
bullion
in
the
temples
had
lessened
and
whose
linen
manufacture
had
moved
towards
the
delta
had
this
great
statesman
been
a
greek
he
would
perhaps
have
gone
on
to
this
city
famous
alike
in
history
and
in
poetry
but
as
it
was
scipio
and
his
friends
then
sailed
for
cyprus
syria
and
the
other
provinces
or
kingdoms
under
the
power
of
rome
to
finish
this
tour
of
inspection
for
some
time
past
the
jews
taking
advantage
of
the
weakness
of
egypt
and
syria
had
been
struggling
to
make
themselves
free
and
at
the
beginning
of
this
reign
simon
maccabæus
the
high
priest
sent
an
embassy
to
rome
with
a
shield
of
gold
weighing
one
thousand
as
a
present
to
get
their
independence
acknowledged
by
the
romans
on
this
the
senate
made
a
treaty
of
alliance
with
the
family
of
the
maccabees
and
using
the
high
tone
of
command
to
which
they
had
for
some
time
past
been
accustomed
they
wrote
to
euergetes
and
the
king
of
syria
ordering
them
not
to
make
war
upon
their
friends
the
jews
but
in
an
after
decree
the
romans
recognise
the
close
friendship
and
the
trading
intercourse
between
egypt
and
judæa
and
when
they
declared
that
they
would
protect
the
jews
in
their
right
to
levy
duties
they
made
an
exception
in
favour
of
the
egyptian
trade
the
people
of
judæa
in
these
struggles
were
glad
to
forget
the
jealousy
which
had
separated
them
from
their
brethren
in
egypt
and
the
old
quarrel
between
the
hebrews
and
the
hellenists
the
sanhedrim
of
jerusalem
wrote
to
the
sanhedrim
of
alexandria
telling
them
that
they
were
going
to
keep
the
feast
of
the
tabernacles
in
solemn
thanksgiving
to
the
almighty
for
their
deliverance
and
begging
for
the
benefit
of
their
prayers
the
jews
however
of
judæa
on
their
gaining
their
former
place
as
a
nation
did
not
as
before
carry
forward
the
chain
of
history
in
their
sacred
books
while
they
had
been
under
the
yoke
of
the
babylonians
the
persians
and
the
syrians
their
language
had
undergone
some
changes
and
when
the
hebrew
of
the
old
testament
was
no
longer
the
spoken
language
they
perhaps
thought
it
unworthy
of
them
to
write
in
any
other
at
any
rate
it
is
to
their
greek
brethren
in
egypt
that
we
are
indebted
for
the
history
of
the
bravery
of
the
maccabees
jason
of
cyrene
wrote
the
history
of
the
maccabees
and
of
the
jewish
wars
against
antiochus
epiphanes
and
his
son
antiochus
eupator
this
work
which
was
in
five
books
is
lost
and
we
now
read
only
the
short
history
which
was
drawn
from
it
by
some
unknown
greek
writer
which
with
the
letter
from
the
jews
of
judaaa
to
their
brethren
of
egypt
forms
the
second
book
of
maccabees
in
the
list
of
alexandrian
authors
we
must
not
forget
to
mention
jesus
the
son
of
sirach
who
came
into
egypt
in
this
reign
and
translated
into
greek
the
hebrew
work
of
his
grandfather
jesus
which
is
named
the
book
of
wisdom
or
ecclesiasticus
it
is
written
in
imitation
of
the
proverbs
of
solomon
and
though
its
pithy
sayings
fall
far
short
of
the
deep
wisdom
and
lofty
thoughts
which
crowd
every
line
of
that
wonderful
work
yet
it
will
always
be
read
with
profit
and
pleasure
in
this
book
we
see
the
earliest
example
that
we
now
possess
of
a
jewish
writer
borrowing
from
the
greek
philosophers
though
how
far
the
greek
thoughts
were
part
of
the
original
hebrew
may
be
doubted
because
the
work
was
left
unfinished
by
jesus
the
grandfather
and
completed
by
the
alexandrian
translator
his
grandson
hereafter
we
shall
see
the
alexandrian
jews
engrafting
on
the
jewish
theology
more
and
more
of
the
platonic
philosophy
which
very
well
suited
the
serious
earnestness
of
their
character
and
which
had
a
most
remarkable
effect
in
making
their
writings
and
opinions
more
fitted
to
spread
into
the
ancient
schools
this
and
other
writings
of
the
alexandrian
jews
were
by
them
added
to
the
list
of
sacred
books
which
together
made
their
greek
bible
but
they
were
never
acknowledged
at
jerusalem
the
hebrew
books
of
the
law
and
the
prophets
were
first
gathered
together
by
nehemiah
after
the
return
of
the
hebrews
from
babylon
but
his
library
had
been
broken
up
during
the
syrian
wars
these
hebrew
books
with
some
few
which
had
since
been
written
were
again
got
together
by
judas
maccabaeus
and
after
his
time
nothing
more
seems
to
have
been
added
to
them
though
the
alexandrian
jews
continued
to
add
new
books
to
their
greek
bible
while
cultivating
the
platonic
philosophy
with
a
success
which
made
a
change
in
their
religious
opinions
it
was
in
alexandria
and
very
much
by
the
help
of
the
jews
that
eastern
and
western
opinions
now
met
each
made
some
change
in
the
other
and
on
the
union
of
the
two
alexandria

to
the

than

this
skill

found
in
the
general

was
one
of
those
men
whose
popular
manners

of
business
and
knowledge
of
war
make

had
been
turned
to

pleasures
and

hierax
brought
forward

could
bear

of
guarding

were
its
greatest
enemies
and
the
mob
rose
in

set
fire
to
the

to
leave

the
birthday
of

was
at

and
it
was
to
be
celebrated

pomp

in
the
midst
of
the
feast
when
the
nobles
and
ambassadors
were
making
their
accustomed

the
grief
of
cleopatra
was
only
equalled
by
the
anger
of
the
alexandrians

more

armed
themselves
under

defend
the
queen
against

then
showed
the
only
act
of
mercy
which
can
be
mentioned
to
his
praise
and
spared
the
life
of
a
prisoner
whom
he
thought
he
could
make

of

then
sent
to
syria
to
her
demetrius

for
help
which
was
at
first
readily
granted
but
demetrius
was
soon
called
home
again
by
a
rising
in
antioch
but
great
indeed
must
be
the
cruelty
which
a
people
will
not
bear
from
their
own
king
rather
than
call
in
a
foreign
master
to
relieve

the

of

hated
and
revengeful
euergetes
was
not
dreaded
so
much
by
the
alexandrians
as
the
being
made
a
province
of
syria
cleopatra
received
no
help
from
demetrius
but
she
lost
the
love
of
her
people
by
asking
for
it
and
she
was
soon
forced
to
fly
from
alexandria
she
put
her
treasures
on
board
a
ship
and
joined
her
son
ptolemy
and
her
demetrius
in
syria
while
euergetes
regained
his
throne
as
soon
as
euergetes

it

when

found
that
he
really
was
king
of
syria
he
would
no
longer
receive
orders
from
egypt
and
euergetes
found
that
the
same
plots
and
forces
were
then
wanted
to
put
down
this
puppet
which
he
had
before
used
to
set
him
up
he
began
by

peace
with
his

sons
of
demetrius
who
gladly
received
his
help
and
conquered

and
gained
the
throne
of
his
father
we
possess
a
curious
inscription
upon
an
obelisk
that
once
stood
in
the
island
of
philæ
recording
as
one
of
the
grievances
that
the
villagers
smarted
under
the
necessity
of
finding
supplies
for
the
troops
on
their
marches
and
also
for
all
the
government
messengers
and
public
servants
or
those
who
claimed
to
travel
as
such
the
cost
of
this
grievance
was
probably
greater
at
philæ
than
in
other
places
because
the
traveller
was
there
stopped
in
his
voyage
by
the
cataracts
on
the
nile
and
he
had
to
be
supplied
with
labourers
to
carry
his
luggage
where
the
navigation
was
interrupted
accordingly
the
priests
at
philæ
petitioned
the
king
that
their
temple
might
be
relieved
from
this
heavy
and
vexatious
charge
which
they
said
lessened
their
power
of
rightly
performing
their
appointed
sacrifices
and
they
further
begged
to
be
allowed
to
set
up
a
monument
to
record
the
grant
which
they
hoped
for
euergetes
granted
the
prayer
and
accordingly
they
set
up
a
small
obelisk
and
the
petition
and
the
answer
were
carved

the
base
of
this
monument

activity

were
there
condemned
to

lash

their
taskmasters

was
equal
to

imprisoned
in
these
caverns
tunnelled
under
the
sea
or
into
the
side
of
the
mountain
and
there
by
torchlight
they
suffered
the
cruel
tortures
of
their
overseers
without
having
power
to
make
their
groans
heard
above
ground
no
lot
upon
earth
could
be
more
wretched
than
that
of
these
unhappy
men
to
all
of
them

would
have
been
thought
a
boon
the
survey
of
the
coast
of
the
red
sea
which
was
undertaken
in
this
or
the
last
reign
did
not
reach
beyond
the
northern
half
of
that
sea
it
was
made
by
agatharcides
who
when
the
philosopher
heracleides
lembus
filled
the
office
of
secretary
to
the
government
under
philometor
had
been
his
scribe
and
reader
agatharcides
gives
a
curious
account
of
the
people
on
these
coasts
and
of
the
more
remarkable
animals
and
products
of
the
country
he
was
a
most
judicious
historian
and
gave
a
better
guess
than
many
at
the
true
cause
of
why
there
was
most
water
in
the
nile
in
the
dry
est
season
of
the
year
which
was
a
subject
of
inquiry
with
the
travellers
and
writers
on
physics
thaïes
said
that
its
waters
were
held
back
at
its
mouths
by
the
etesian
winds
which
blow
from
the
north
during
the
summer
months
and
democritus
of
abdera
said
that
these
winds
carried
heavy
to
ethiopia
whereas
the
north
winds
do
not
begin
to
blow
till
the
nile
has
risen
and
the
river
has
returned
to
its
usual
size
before
the
winds
cease
anaxagoras
who
was
followed
by
euripides
the
poet
thought
that
the
large
supply
of
water
came
from
the
melting
of
snow
in
ethiopia
ephorus
thought
that
there
were
deep
springs
in
the
bed
which
gushed
forth
with
greater
force
in
summer
than
in
winter
herodotus
and
oenopides
both
thought
that
the
river
was
in
its
natural
state
when
the
country
was
overflowed
and
the
former
said
that
its
waters
were
lessened
in
winter
by
the
attraction
of
the
sun
then
over
southern
ethiopia
and
the
latter
said
that
as
the
earth
grew
cool
the
waters
were
sucked
into
its
pores
the
sources
of
the
nile
were
hidden
by
the
barbarism
of
the
tribes
on
its
banks
but
by
this
time
travellers
had
reached
the
region
of
tropical
rains
and
agatharcides
said
that
the
overflow
in
egypt
arose
from
the
rains
in
upper
ethiopia
but
the
abyssinian
rains
begin
to
fall
at
midsummer
too
late
to
cause
the
inundation
in
egypt
and
therefore
the
truth
seemed
after
all
to
lie
with
the
priests
of
memphis
who
said
the
nile
rises
on
the
other
side
of
the
equator
and
the
rain
falling
in
what
was
winter
on
that
side
of
the
globe
made
the
nile
overflow
in
the
egyptian
summer
from
the
very
earliest
times
says
ebers
the
pharaohs
had
understood
the
necessity
of
measuring
exactly
the
amount
or
deficiency
of
the
inundations
of
the
nile
and
nilometers
are
preserved
which
were
erected
high
up
the
river
in
nubia
by
kings
of
the
old
empire
by
princes
that
is
to
say
who
reigned
before
the
invasion
of
the
hyksos
herodotus
tells
us
that
the
river
must
rise
sixteen
ells
for
the
inundation
to
be
considered
a
favourable
one
if
it
remained
below
this
mark
the
higher
fields
failed
in
obtaining
a
due
supply
of
water
and
a
dearth
was
the
result
if
it
greatly
exceeded
it
it
broke
down
the
dykes
damaged
the
villages
and
had
not
retired
into
its
bed
by
the
time

sowing
the
seed
thus
the
peasant
who
could
expect
no
rain
and
was
threatened
neither
by
frosts
nor
storms
could
have
his
prospects
of
a
good
or
bad
harvest
read
off
by
the
priests
with
perfect
certainty
by
the
scale
of
the
nilometer
and
not
by
the
servants
of
the
divinities
only
but
by
the
officers
of
the
realm
who
calculated
the
amount
of
taxes
to
be
paid
to
them
in
proportion
to
the
rising
of

of

their

fraud

which

government
endeavoured

year
to
secure
the
full
amount

held
from

remotest

present
time
customs
prevail
which
can
it
is
alleged
be
traced
by
direct
descent
to
the
times
of
the
pharaohs
and
yet
during
the
dominion
of
christianity
in
egypt
and
later
again
under
sovereigns
governing
a
nation
wholly
converted
to
islam
the
old
worship
of
the
nile
with
all
its
splendour
its
display
and
its
strange
ceremonies
was
extirpated
with
the
utmost
rigour
but
some
portion
of
every
discarded
religion
becomes
merged
in
the
new
one
that
has
supplanted
it
as
a
fresh
form
of
superstition
and
thus
we
discover
from
a
christian
document
dating
from
the
sixth
century
that
the
rising
of
the
nile
its
was
no
longer
attributed
to
osiris
but
to
a
certain
saint
orion
and
as
the
priest
of
antiquity
taught
that
a
tear
of
isis
led
to
the
overflowing
of
the
nile
so
we
hear
the
egyptians
of
the
present
day
say
that
divine
has
fallen
into
the
stream
and
caused
the
flood
the
trade
of
the
egyptians
had
given
them
very
little
knowledge
of
geography
indeed
the
whole
trade
of
the
ancients
was
carried
on
by
buying
goods
from
their
nearest
neighbours
on
one
side
and
selling
them
to
those
on
the
other
side
of
them
long
voyages
were
unknown

though
the
trading
wealth
of

had
mainly
arisen
from
carrying
the
merchandise
of
india
and
arabia
felix
from
the
ports
on
the
red
sea
to
the
ports
on

the

seem
to
have
gained

knowledge
of
the
countries

which
these
goods
came

desert
were
both
easier
and
cheaper
than
a
coasting
voyage
we
have
before
learned
from
thinking
it
worth
while
to
build
watering
and
in
the
desert
between
koptos
and
berenicê
to
save
the
voyage
between
berenicê
and
cosseir
india
seems
to
have
been
only
known
to
the
greeks
as
a
country
that
by
sea
was
to
be
reached
by
the
way
of
the
euphrates
and
the
persian
gulf
and
though
scylax
had
by
the
orders
of
darius
dropped
down
the
river
indus
coasted
arabia
and
thence
reached
the
red
sea
this
voyage
was
either
forgotten
or
disbelieved
and
in
the
time
of
the
ptolemies
it
seems
probable
that
nobody
thought
that
india
could
be
reached
by
sea
from
egypt
arrian
indeed
thought
that
the
difficulty
of
carrying
water
in
their
small
ships
with
large
crews
of
rowers
was
alone
great
enough
to
stop
a
voyage
of
such
a
length
along
a
desert
coast
that
could
not
supply
them
with
fresh
water
the
long
voyages
of
solomon
and
necho
had
been
limited
to
coasting
africa
the
voyage
of
alexander
the
great
had
been
from
the
indus
to
the
persian
gulf
hence
it
was
that
the
court
of
euergetes
was
startled
by
the
strange
news
that
the
arabian
guards
on
the
coast
of
the
red
sea
had
found
a
man
in
a
boat
by
himself
who
could
not
speak
koptic
but
who
they
afterwards
found
was
an
indian
who
had
sailed
straight
from
india
and
had
lost
his
shipmates
he
was
willing
to
show
any
one
the
route
by
which
he
had
sailed
and
eudoxus
of
cyzicus
in
asia
minor
came
to
alexandria
to
persuade
euergetes
to
give
him
the
command
of
a
vessel
for
this
voyage
of
discovery
a
vessel
was
given
him
and
though
he
was
but
badly
fitted
out
he
reached
a
country
which
he
called
india
by
sea
and
brought
back
a
cargo
of
spices
and
precious
stones
he
wrote
an
account
of
the
coasts
which
he
visited
and
it
was
made
use
of
by
pliny
but
it
is
more
than
probable
the
unknown
country
called
india
which
eudoxus
visited
was
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
abyssinia
was
often
called
india
by
the
ancients
in
these
attempts
at
maritime
discovery
and
efforts
after
a
cheaper
means
of
obtaining
the
indian
products
the
greek
sailors
of
euergetes
made
a
settlement
in
the
island
of
dioscorides
now
called
socotara
in
the
indian
ocean
forty
leagues
eastward
of
the
coast
of
africa
and
there
they
met
the
trading
vessels
from
india
and
ceylon
this
little
island
continued
a
greek
colony
for
upwards
of
seven
centuries
and
greek
was
the
only
language
spoken
there
till
it
fell
under
the
arabs
in
the
twilight
of
history
when
all
the
european
possessions
in
africa
were
overthrown
but
the
art
of
navigation
was
so
far
unknown
that
but
little
use
was
made
of
this
voyage
the
goods
of
india
which
were
all
costly
and
of
small
weight
were
still
for
the
most
part
carried
across
the
desert
on
backs
and
we
may
remark
that
at
a
later
period
hardly
more
than
twenty
small
vessels
ever
went
to
india
in
one
year
during
the
reigns
of
the
ptolemies
and
that
it
was
not
till
egypt
was
a
province
of
rome
that
the
across
the
arabian
sea
were
found
out
by
hippalus
a
pilot
in
the
indian
trade
the
voyage
was
little
known
in
the
time
of
pliny
even
the
learned
propertius
seems
to
have
thought
that
silk
was
a
product
of
arabia
and
palmyra
and
petra
the
two
chief
cities
in
the
desert
whose
whole
wealth
rested
and
whose
very
being
hung
upon
their
being
for
these
caravans
were
still
wealthy
cities
in
the
second
century
of
our
era
when
the
voyage
by
the
arabian
sea
became
for
the
first
time
easier
and
cheaper
than
the
journeys
across
the
desert
euergetes
had
been
a
pupil
of
aristobolus
a
learned
jew
a
writer
of
the
peripatetic
sect
of
philosophers
one
who
had
made
his
learning
respected
by
the
pagans
from
his
success
in
cultivating
their
philosophy
and
also
of
aristarchus
the
grammarian
the
editor
of
homer
and
though
the
king
had
given
himself
up
to
the
lowest
pleasures
yet
he
held
with
his
crown
that
love
of
letters
and
of
learning
which
had
ennobled
his
forefathers
he
was
himself
an
author
and
wrote
like
ptolemy
soter
his
memorabilia
or
an
account
of
what
he
had
seen
most
remarkable
in
his
lifetime
we
may
suppose
that
his
writings
were
not
of
a
very
high
order
they
were
quoted
by
athengeus
who
wrote
in
the
reign
of
marcus
aurelius
but
we
learn
little
else
from
them
than
the
names
of
the
mistresses
of
ptolemy
philadelphus
and
that
a
flock
of
pheasants
was
kept
in
the
palace
of
alexandria
he
also
wrote
a
commentary
on
homer
of
which
we
know
nothing
when
busy
upon
literature
he
would
allow
his
companions
to
argue
with
him
till
midnight
on
a
point
of
history
or
a
verse
of
poetry
but
not
one
of
them
ever
uttered
a
word
against
his
tyranny
or
argued
in
favour
of
a
less
cruel
treatment
of
his
enemies
in
this
reign
the
schools
of
alexandria
though
not
holding
the
rank
which
they
had
gained
under
philadelphus
were
still
highly
thought
of
the
king
still
gave
public
salaries
to
the
professors
and
panaretus
who
had
been
a
pupil
of
the
philosopher
arcesilaus
received
the
very
large
sum
of
twelve
talents
or
ten
thousand
dollars
a
year
sositheus
and
his
rival
the
younger
homer
the
tragic
poets
of
this
reign
have
even
been
called
two
of
the
pleiades
of
alexandria
but
that
was
a
title
given
to
many
authors
of
very
different
times
and
to
some
of
very
little
merit
such
indeed
was
the
want
of
merit
among
the
poets
of
alexandria
that
many
of
their
names
would
have
been
unknown
to
posterity
had
they
not
been
saved
in
the
pages
of
the
critics
and
grammarians
and
pieced
together
by
the
skill
of
nineteenth
century
investigators
illustration
temple
of
kom
ombo
but
unfortunately
the
larger
number
of
the
men
of
letters
had
in
the
late
wars
taken
part
with
against
the
cruel
and
luxurious
euergetes
hence
when
the
streets
of
alexandria
were
flowing
with
the
blood
of
those
whom
he
called
his
enemies
crowds
of
learned
men
left
egypt
and
were
driven
to
earn
a
livelihood
by
teaching
in
the
cities
to
which
they
then
fled
they
were
all
greeks
and
few
of
them
had
been
born
in
alexandria
they
had
been
brought
there
by
the
wealth
of
the
country
and
the
favour
of
the
sovereign
and
they
now
withdrew
when
these
advantages
were
taken
away
from
them
the
isles
and
coasts
of
the
mediterranean
were
so
filled
with
grammarians
philosophers
geometers
musicians
schoolmasters
painters
and
physicians
from
alexandria
that
the
cruelty
of
euergetes
like
the
taking
of
constantinople
by
the
turks
may
be
said
to
have
spread
learning
by
the
of
its
professors
the
city
which
was
then
rising
highest
in
arts
and
letters
was
pergamus
in
asia
minor
which
under
eumenes
and
attalus
was
almost
taking
the
place
which
alexandria
had
before
held
its
library
already
held
two
hundred
thousand
volumes
and
raised
a
jealousy
in
the
mind
of
euergetes
not
content
with
buying
books
and
adding
to
the
size
of
his
own
library
he
wished
to
lessen
the
libraries
of
his
rivals
and
nettled
at
the
number
of
volumes
which
eumenes
had
got
together
at
pergamus
he
made
a
law
forbidding
the
export
of
the
egyptian
papyrus
on
which
they
were
written
on
this
the
copiers
employed
by
eumenes
wrote
their
books
upon
sheepskins
which
were
called
or
parchment
from
the
name
of
the
city
in
which
they
were
written
thus
our
own
two
words
parchment
from
and
paper
from
remain
as
monuments
of
the
rivalry
in
between
the
two
kings
euergetes
was
so
bloated
with
disease
that
his
body
was
nearly
six
feet
round
and
he
was
made
weak
and
slothful
by
this
weight
of
flesh
he
walked
with
a
crutch
and
wore
a
loose
robe
like
a
which
reached
to
his
feet
and
hands
he
gave
himself
up
very
much
to
eating
and
drinking
and
on
the
year
that
he
was
chosen
priest
of
apollo
by
the
cyrenians
he
showed
his
pleasure
at
the
honour
by
a
memorable
feast
which
he
gave
in
a
costly
manner
to
all
those
who
had
before
filled
that
office
he
had
reigned
six
years
with
his
brother
then
eighteen
years
in
cyrene
and
lastly
years
after
the
death
of
his
brother
and
he
died
in
the
year
of
his
reign
and
perhaps
the
of
his
age
he
left
a
widow

two
sons

and
three
daughters
cleopatra
married
to
her

and

unmarried
and
also
a
natural
son
ptolemy
apion
to
whom
by
will
he
left
the
kingdom
of
cyrene
while
he
left
the
kingdom
of
egypt
to
his
widow
and
one
of
his
sons
giving
her
the
power
of
choosing
which
should
be
her
colleague
the
first
euergetes
earned
and
deserved
the
name
which
was
sadly
disgraced
by
the
second
but
such
was
the
fame
of
greatness
that
the
titles
of
its
kings
were
copied
in
nearly
every
greek
kingdom
we
meet
with
the
flattering
names
of
soter
philadelphus
euergetes
and
the
rest
on
the
coins
of
syria
parthia
cappadocia

then
a

for
her

throne
most
likely
because
it
would
have
been
longer
in
the
course
of
years
before
he
would
have
claimed
his
share
of
power
but
she
was
forced
by
a
threatened
rising
of
the
alexandrians
to
make
her
elder
son
king
before
however
she
would
do
this
she
made
a
treaty
with
him
which
would
strongly
prove
if
anything
were
still
wanting
the
vice
and
meanness
of
the
egyptian
court
it
was
that
although
married
to
his
sister
cleopatra
of
whom
he
was
very
fond
he
should
put
her
away
and
marry
his
younger
sister
selene
because
the
mother
hoped
that
selene
would
be
false
to
her
cause
and
weaken
his
party
in
the
state
by
her
treachery
ptolemy
took
the
name
of
soter
though
he
is
more
often
called
lathyrus
from
a
stain
upon
his
face
in
the
form
of
an
pricked
into
his
skin
in
honour
of
osiris
he
was
also
called
philometor
and
we
learn
from
an
inscription
on
a
temple
at
apollinopolis
parva
that
both
these
names
formed
part
of
the
style
in
which
the
public
acts
ran
in
this
reign
it
is
dedicated
by
queen
cleopatra
and
king
ptolemy
gods
philometores
soteres
and
his
children
without
mentioning
his
wife
here
as
in
persia
and
judaaa
the
mother
often
held
rank
above
his
wife
the
name
of
philometor
was
given
to
him
by
his
mother
because
though
he
had
reached
the
years
of
manhood
she
wished
to
act
as
his
guardian
but
her
unkindness
to
him
was
so
remarkable
that
historians
have
thought
that
it
was
a
nickname
the
mother
and
the
son
were
jointly
styled
sovereigns
of
egypt
but
they
lived
apart
and
in
distrust
of
one
another
each
surrounded
by
personal
friends
while
stronger
mind
and
greater
skill
in
kingcraft
gained
for
her
the
larger
share
of
power
and
the
effective
control
of
egypt
cleopatra
the
daughter
put
away
by
her
husband
at
the
command
of
her
mother
soon
made
a
treaty
of
marriage
with
antiochus
cyzicenus
the
friend
of
her
late
husband
who
was
struggling
for
the
throne
of
syria
with
his
brother
antiochus
grypus
the
husband
of
her
sister
tryphaana
and
on
her
way
to
syria
she
stopped
at
cyprus
where
she
raised
a
large
army
and
took
it
with
her
as
her
dower
to
help
her
new
husband
against
his
brother
and
her
sister
with
this
addition
to
his
army
cyzicenus
thought
his
forces
equal
to
those
of
his
brother
he
marched
against
him
and
gave
him
battle
but
he
was
beaten
and
he
fled
with
his
wife
cleopatra
and
they
shut
themselves
up
in
the
city
of
antioch
grypus
and
tryphaana
then
laid
siege
to
the
city
and
the
astute
tryphaana
soon
took
her
revenge
on
her
sister
for
coming
into
syria
to
marry
the
brother
and
rival
of
her
husband
the
city
was
taken
and
tryphaana
ordered
her
sister
to
be
torn
from
the
temple
into
which
she
had
fled
and
to
be
put
to
death
in
vain
grypus
urged
that
he
did
not
wish
his
victory
to
be
stained
by
the
death
of
a
sister
that
cleopatra
was
by
marriage
his
sister
as
well
as
hers
that
she
was
the
aunt
of
their
children
and
that
the
gods
would
punish
them
if
they
dragged
her
from
the
altar
but
tryphaana
was
merciless
and
unmoved
she
gave
her
own
orders
to
the
soldiers
and
cleopatra
was
killed
as
she
clung
with
her
arms
to
the
statue
of
the
goddess
this
cruelty
however
was
soon
overtaken
by
punishment
in
the
next
battle
cyzicenus
was
the
conqueror
and
he
put
tryphaana
to
death
to
quiet
as
was
said
the
ghost
of
her
murdered
sister
in
the
third
year
of
her
reign
cleopatra
cocce
gave
the
island
of
cyprus
to
her
younger
son
alexander
as
an
independent
kingdom
thinking
that
he
would
be
of
more
use
to
her
there
in
upholding
her
power
against
his
brother
lathyrus
than
he
could
be
at
alexandria
in
the
last
reign
eudoxus
had
been
entrusted
by
euergetes
with
a
vessel
and
a
cargo
for
a
trading
voyage
of
discovery
towards
india
and
in
this
reign
he
was
again
sent
by
cleopatra
down
the
red
sea
to
trade
with
the
unknown
countries
in
the
east
how
far
he
went
may
be
doubted
but
he
brought
back
with
him
from
the
coast
of
africa
the
prow
of
a
ship
ornamented
with
a
head
the
usual
figurehead
of
the
carthaginian
ships
this
he
showed
to
the
alexandrian
pilots
who
knew
it
as
belonging
to
one
of
the
phoenician
ships
of
cadiz
or
gibraltar
eudoxus
justly
argued
that
this
prow
proved
that
it
was
possible
to
sail
round
africa
and
to
reach
india
by
sea
from
alexandria
the
government
however
would
not
fit
him
out
for
a
third
voyage
but
his
reasons
were
strong
enough
to
lead
many
to
join
him
and
others
to
help
him
with
money
and
he
thereby
fitted
out
three
vessels
on
this
attempt
to
sail
round
africa
by
the
westward
voyage
he
passed
the
pillars
of
hercules
or
straits
of
gibraltar
and
then
turned
southward
he
even
reached
that
part
of
africa
where
the
coast
turns
eastward
here
he
was
stopped
by
his
ships
wanting
repair
the
only
knowledge
that
he
brought
back
for
us
is
that
the
natives
of
that
western
coast
were
of
nearly
the
same
race
as
the
ethiopians
on
the
eastern
coast
he
was
able
to
sail
only
part
of
the
way
back
and
he
reached
mauritania
with
difficulty
by
land
he
thence
returned
home
where
he
met
with
the
fate
not
unusual
to
early
travellers
his
whole
story
was
doubted
and
the
geographers
at
home
did
not
believe
that
he
had
ever
visited
the
countries
that
he
attempted
to
describe
the
people
of
lower
egypt
were
as
we
have
seen
of
several
races
and
as
each
of
the
surrounding
nations
was
in
its
turn
powerful
that
race

fall

kopts

delta
when
the
free
states
of
greece
held
the
first
rank
in
the
world
even
before
the
time

the
greeks
of
lower
egypt
were
masters
of
their
and
now
that
judæa
under
the
bravery
of
the
maccabees
had
gained
among
nations
a
rank
far
higher
than
what
its
size
entitled
it
to
the
egyptian
jews
found
that
they
had
in
the
same
way
gained

in
alexandria
cleopatra
had
given
the
command
of
her
army
to
two
jews
chelcias
and
ananias
the
sons
of
onias
the
priest
of
heliopolis
and
hence
when
the
civil
war
broke
out
between
the
jews
and
samaritans
cleopatra
helped
the
jews
and
perhaps
for
that
reason
lathyrus
helped
the
samaritans
he
sent
six
thousand
men
to
his
friend
antiochus
cyzicenus
to
be
led
against
the
jews
but
this
force
was
beaten
by
the
two
sons
of
hyrcanus
the
high
priest
by
this
act
lathyrus
must
have
lost
the
of
the
jews
of
lower
egypt
and
hence
cleopatra
again
ventured
to
choose
her
own
partner
on
the
throne
she
raised
a
riot
in
alexandria
against
him
in
the
tenth
year
of
their
reign
on
his
putting
to
death
some
of
her
friends
or
more
likely
as
pausanias
says
by
showing
to
the
people
some
of
her
eunuchs
covered
with
blood
who
she
said
were
wounded
by
him
and
she
forced
him
to
fly
from
egypt
she
took
from
him
his
wife
selene
whom
she
had
before
thrust
upon
him
and
who
had
borne
him
two
children
and
she
allowed
him
to
withdraw
to
the
kingdom
of
cyprus
from
which
place
she
recalled
her
favourite
son
alexander
to
reign

who
was
nearly
the

the
building
of
these
great
temples
did
not
cease
the
two
sons
were
so
far
puppets
in
the
hands
of
their
clever
mother
that
on
the
recall
of
alexander
no
change
was
seen
in

of
the
names
which
were
placed
at

of
the
public
acts
the
former
year
was
called
the
tenth
of
cleopatra
and
ptolemy

and
this
year
was
called
the
eleventh
of

of
ptolemy
alexander
as
alexander
counted
his
years
from
the
time
when
he
was
sent
with
the
title
of
king
to
cyprus
as
he
was
like
his
brother
under
the
guidance
of
his
mother
he
was
like
him
in
the
hieroglyphical
inscriptions
called
while
the
kingdoms
of
egypt
and
syria
were
alike
weakened
by
civil
wars
and
by
the
vices
of
their
kings
judæa
as
we
have
seen
had
risen
under
the
wise
government
of
the
maccabees
to
the
rank
of
an
independent
state
and
latterly
aristobulus
the
eldest
son
of
and
afterwards
alexander
jannseus
his
second
son
had
made
themselves
kings
but
gaza
ptolemaïs
and
some
other
cities
bravely
refused
to
part
with
their
liberty
and
sent
to
lathyrus
then
king
of
cyprus
for
help
this
was
not
however
done
without
many
misgivings
for
some
were
wise
enough
to
see
that
if
lathyrus
helped
them
cleopatra
would
on
the
other
hand
help
their
king
jannasus
and
when
lathyrus
landed
at
sicaminos
with
thirty
thousand
men
the
citizens
of
ptolemaïs
refused
even
to
listen
to
a
message
from
him
the
city
of
gaza
then
eagerly
sent
for
the
help
which
the
city
of
ptolemaïs
refused
lathyrus
drove
back
jannasus
and
marched
upon
asochis
a
city
of
galilee
where
he
scaled
the
walls
on
the
sabbath
day
and
took
ten
thousand
prisoners
and
a
large
booty
he
then
sat
down
before
the
city
of
saphoris
but
left
it
on
hearing
that
jannasus
was
marching
against
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
jordan
at
the
head
of
a
force
larger
than
his
own
he
crossed
the
river
in
face
of
the
jewish
army
and
routed
it
with
great
slaughter
the
jewish
historian
adds
that
between
thirty
and
fifty
thousand
men
were
slain
upon
the
field
of
battle
and
that
the
women
and
children
of
the
neighbouring
villages
were
cruelly
put
to
death
cleopatra
now
began
to
fear
that
her
son
lathyrus
would
soon
make
himself
too
powerful
if
not
checked
in
his
career
of
success
and
that
he
might
be
able
to
march
upon
egypt
she
therefore
mustered
her
forces
and
put
them
under
the
command
of
chelcias
and
ananias
her
jewish
generals
she
sent
her
treasure
her
will
and
the
children
of
alexander
to
the
island
of
cos
as
a
place
of
safety
and
then
marched
with
the
army
into
palestine
having
sent
forward
her
son
alexander
with
the
fleet
by
this
movement
lathyrus
was
unable
to
keep
his
ground
in
and
he
took
the
bold
step
of
marching
towards
egypt
but
he
was
quickly
followed
by
chelcias
and
his
army
was
routed
though
chelcias
lost
his
life
in
the
battle
cleopatra
after
taking
ptolemaïs
sent
part
of
her
army
to
help
that
which
had
been
led
by
chelcias
and
lathyrus
was
forced
to
shut
himself
up
in
gaza
soon
after
this
the
campaign
ended
by
lathyrus
returning
to
cyprus
and
cleopatra
to
egypt
on
this
success
cleopatra
was
advised
to
seize
upon
the
throne
of
jannseus
and
again
to
add
to
egypt
the
provinces
of
palestine
and
which
had
so
long
made
part
of
the
kingdom
of
her
forefathers
she
yielded
however
to
the
reasons
of
her
general
ananias
for
the
jews
of
lower
egypt
were
too
strong
to
be
treated
with
slight
it
was
by
the
help
of
the
jews
that
cleopatra
had
driven
her
son
lathyrus
out
of
egypt
they
formed
a
large
part
of
the
egyptian
armies
which
were
no
longer
even
commanded
by
greeks
and
it
must
have
been
by
these
clear
and
unanswerable
reasons
that
ananias
was
able
to
turn
the
queen
from
the
thoughts
of
this
conquest
and
to
renew
the
league
between
egypt
and
judæa
cleopatra
however
was
still
afraid
that
lathyrus
would
be
helped
by
his
friend
antiochus
cyzicenus
to
conquer
egypt
and
she
therefore
kept
up
the
quarrel
between
the
brothers
by
again
sending
troops
to
help
antiochus
grypus
and
lastly
she
gave
him
in
marriage
her
daughter
selene
whom
she
had
before
forced
upon
lathyrus
she
then
sent
an
army
against
cyprus
and
lathyrus
was
beaten
and
forced
to
fly
from
the
island
in
the
middle
of
this
reign
died
ptolemy
apion
king
of
cyrene
he
was
the
of
lathyrus
and
alexander
and
having
been
made
king
of
cyrene
by
his
father
euergetes
he
had
there
reigned
quietly
for
twenty
years
being
between
egypt
and
carthage
then
called
the
roman
province
of
africa
and
having
no
army
which
he
could
lead
against
the
roman
legions
he
had
placed
himself
under
the
guardianship
of
rome
he
had
bought
a
truce
during
his
lifetime
by
making
the
roman
people
his
heirs
in
his
will
so
that
on
his
death
they
were
to
have
his
kingdom
cyrene
had
been
part
of
egypt
for
above
two
hundred
years
and
was
usually
governed
by
a
younger
son
or
brother
of
the
king
but
on
the
death
of
ptolemy
apion
the
roman
senate
who
had
latterly
been
grasping
at
everything
within
their
reach
claimed
his
kingdom
as
their
inheritance
and
in
the
flattering
language
of
their
decree
by
which
the
country
was
enslaved
they
declared
cyrene
free
from
that
time
forward
it
was
practically
a
province
of
rome
ptolemy
alexander
who
had
been
a
mere
tool
in
the
hands
of
his
mother
was
at
last
tired
of
his
gilded
chains
but
he
saw
no
means
of
throwing
them
off
or
of
gaining
that
power
in
the
state
which
his
birth
and
title
and
the
age
which
he
had
then
reached
ought
to
have
given
him
the
army
was
in
favour
of
his
mother
and
an
unsuccessful
effort
would
certainly
have
been
punished
with
death
so
he
took
perhaps
the
only
path
open
to
him
he
left
egypt
by
stealth
and
chose
rather
to
quit
his
throne
and
palace
than
to
live
surrounded
by
the
creatures
of
his
mother
and
in
daily
fear
for
his
life
cleopatra
might
well
doubt
whether
she
could
keep
her
throne
against
both
her
sons
and
she
therefore
sent
messengers
with
fair
promises
to
alexander
to
ask
him
to
return
to
egypt
but
he
knew
his
mother
too
well
ever
again
to
trust
himself
in
her
hands
and
while
she
was
taking
steps
to
have
him
put
to
death
on
his
return
he
formed
a
plot
against
her
life
by
letters
in
this
double
game
alexander
had
the
advantage
of
his
mother
her
character
was
so
well
known
that
he
needed
not
to
be
told
of
what
was
going
on
while
she
perhaps
thought
that
the
son
whom
she
had
so
long
ruled
as
a
child
would
not
dare
to
act
as
a
man
plot
was
of
the
two
the
best
laid
and
on
his
reaching
egypt
his
mother
was
put
to
death
but
alexander
did
not
long
enjoy
the
fruits
of
his
murder
the
next
year
the
alexandrians
rose
against
him
in
a
fury
he
was
hated
not
so
much
perhaps
for
the
murder
of
his
mother
as
for
the
cruelties
which
he
had
been
guilty
of
or
at
least
had
to
bear
the
blame
of
while
he
reigned
with
her
his
own
soldiers
turned
against
him
and
he
was
forced
to
seek
his
safety
by
flying
on
board
a
vessel
in
the
harbour
and
he
left
egypt
with
his
wife
and
daughter
he
was
followed
by
a
fleet
under
the
command
of
tyrrhus
but
he
reached
myrse
a
city
of
lycia
in
safety
and
afterwards
in
crossing
over
to
cyprus
he
was
met
by
an
egyptian
fleet
under
chaereas
and
killed
in
battle
though
others
may
have
been
guilty
of
more
crimes
alexander
had
perhaps
the
fewest
good
qualities
of
any
of
the
family
of
the
lagidaa
during
his
idle
reign
of
twenty
years
in
which
the
crimes
ought
in
fairness
to
be
laid
chiefly
to
his
mother
he
was
wholly
given
up
to
the
lowest
and
worst
of
pleasures
by
which
his
mind
and
body
were
alike
ruined
he
was
so
bloated
with
vice
and
disease
that
he
seldom
walked
without
crutches
but
at
his
feasts
he
could
leap
from
his
raised
couch
and
dance
with
naked
feet
upon
the
floor
with
the
companions
of
his
vices
he
was
blinded
by
flattery
ruined
by
debauchery
and
hated
by
the
people
his
coins
are
not
easily
known
from
those
of
the
other
kings
which
also
bore
the
name
of
the
round
the
eagle
some
of
the
coins
of
his
mother
have
the
same
words
round
the
eagle
on
the
one
side
while
on
the
other
is
her
head
with
a
helmet

like
the
head
of
an
elephant

her
head

the
name

there
are
other
coins

head
of

joint
sovereignty
of
herself
and

the
reign

perhaps

never

a
dress
which
he
never
wore

eighteen
years
by
himself

cyprus

during
those
years
of
banishment
had
shown
a
wisdom
and
good
behaviour
which
must
have
won
the
esteem
of
the
alexandrians

overflowed

taking
advantage

the
revolutions
in

a

rose
in
rebellion
we
can
therefore
hardly
wonder
that
when
lathyrus
landed
in
egypt
and
tried
to
recall
the
troubled
cities
to
quiet
government
and
good
order
thebes
should

do
little
against

the
overthrow
of
the
massive
temple

and
the
utter
ruin
of
the
city
prove
how
slowly
they
yielded
to
greater
skill
and
numbers
and
mark
the
distrust
lest
the
temples
should
be
again

made
use
of
perhaps
the
only
time

when

had
been
stormed

a
long
siege

when
it
first
fell
under
the
persians
and
the
ruin
which
marked
the
footsteps
of
cambyses
had
never
been
wholly
repaired
but
the
wanton
cruelty
of
the
foreigners
did
little
mischief
when
compared
with
the
unpitying
and
unforgiving
distrust
of
the
native
conquerors
the
temples
of
tentyra
apollinopolis
latopolis
and
philæ
show
that
the
massive
egyptian
buildings
when
let
alone
can
withstand
the
wear
of
time
for
thousands
of
years
but
the
harder
hand
of
man
works
much
faster
and
the
wide
acres
of
theban
ruins
prove
alike
the
greatness
of
the
city
and
the
force
with
which
it
was
overthrown
and
this
is
the
last
time
that
egyptian
thebes
is
met
with
in
the
pages
of
history
the
traveller
whose
means
and
leisure
have
allowed
him
to
reach
the
spot
now
counts
the
arab
villages
which
have
been
built
within
the
bounds
and
perhaps
pitches
his
tent
in
the
open
space
in
the
middle
of
them
but
the
ruined
temples
still
stand
to
call
forth
his
wonder
they
have
seen
the
whole
portion
of
time
of
which
history
keeps
the
reckoning
roll
before
them
they
have
seen
kingdoms
and
nations
rise
and
fall
babylonians
assyrians
hebrews
persians
greeks
and
romans
they
have
seen
the
childhood
of
all
that
we
call
ancient
and
they
still
seem
likely
to
stand
to
tell
their
tale
to
those
who
will
hereafter
call
us
ancients
after
this
rebellion
lathyrus
reigned
in
quiet
and
was
even
able
to
be
of
use
to
his
greek
allies
and
the
athenians
in
gratitude
set
up
statues
of
bronze
to
him
and
berenicê
his
daughter
during
this
reign
the
romans
were
carrying
on
a
war
with
mithridates
king
of
pontus
in
asia
minor
and
sulla
who
was
then
at
the
head
of
the
republic
sent
lucullus
the
soldier
the
scholar
and
the
philosopher
as
ambassador
to
alexandria
to
ask
for
help
against
the
enemy
the
egyptian
fleet
moved
out
of
harbour
to
meet
him
a
pomp
which
the
kings
of
egypt
had
before
kept
for
themselves
alone
lathyrus
received
him
on
shore
with
the
greatest
respect
lodged
him
in
the
palace
and
invited
him
to
his
own
table
an
honour
which
no
foreigner
had
enjoyed
since
the
kings
of
egypt
had
thrown
aside
the
plain
manners
of
the
first
ptolemies
lucullus
had
brought
with
him
the
philosopher
antiochus
of
athens
who
had
been
the
pupil
of
philo
and
they
found
time
to
enjoy
the
society
of
dion
the
academic
philosopher
who
was
then
teaching
at
alexandria
and
there
they
might
have
been
seen
with
heraclitus
of
tyre
talking
together
about
the
changes
which
were
creeping
into
the
platonic
philosophy
and
about
the
two
newest
works
of
philo
which
had
just
come
to
alexandria
antiochus
could
not
read
them
without
showing
his
anger
such
sceptical
opinions
had
never
before
been
heard
of
in
the
academy
but
they
knew
the
handwriting
of
philo
they
were
certainly
his
selius
and
tetrilius
who
were
there
had
heard
him
teach
the
same
opinions
at
rome
whither
he
had
fled
and
where
he
was
then
teaching
cicero
the
next
day
the
matter
was
again
talked
over
with
lucullus
heraclitus
aristus
of
athens
ariston
and
dion
and
it
ended
in
antiochus
writing
a
book
which
he
named
sosus
against
those
new
opinions
of
his
old
master
against
the
new
academy
and
in
behalf
of
the
old
academy
lathyrus
understood
the
principles
of
the
balance
of
power
and
his
own
interest
too
well
to
help
the
romans
to
crush
mithridates
and
he
wisely
wished
not
to
quarrel
with
either
he
therefore
at
once
made
up
his
mind
not
to
grant
the
fleet
which
lucullus
had
been
sent
to
ask
for
it
had
been
usual
for
the
kings
of
egypt
to
pay
the
expenses
of
the
roman
ambassadors
while
living
in
alexandria
and
lathyrus
offered
four
times
the
usual
allowance
to
lucullus
beside
eighty
talents
of
silver
lucullus
however
would
take
nothing
beyond
his
expenses
and
returned
the
gifts
which
were
meant
as
a
civil
refusal
of
the
fleet
and
having
failed
in
his
embassy
he
sailed
hastily
for
cyprus
leaving
the
wonders
of
egypt
unvisited
lathyrus
sent
a
fleet
of
honour
to
accompany
him
on
his
voyage
and
gave
him
his
portrait
cut
in
an
emerald
mithridates
was
soon
afterwards
conquered
by
the
romans
and
it
was
only
by
skilful
embassies
and
bribes
that
lathyrus
was
able
to
keep
off
the
punishment
which
seemed
to
await
him
for
having
thus
disobeyed
the
orders
of
sulla
egypt
was
then
the
only
kingdom
to
the
west
of
persia
that
had
not
yet
bowed
its
neck
under
the
roman
yoke
the
coins
of
lathyrus
are
not
easily
or
certainly
known
from
those
of
the
other
ptolemies
but
those
of
his
second
wife
bear
her
head
on
the
one
side
with
the
name
of
selene
and
on
the
other
side
the
eagle
with
the
name
of
illustration
coin
of
ptolemy
lathyrus
and
selene
he
had
before
reigned
ten
years
with
his
mother
and
after
his
death
he
reigned
six
years
and
a
half
more
but
as
he
counted
the
years
that
he
had
reigned
in
cyprus
he
died
in
the
year
of
his
reign
he
left
a
daughter
named
berenicê
and
two
natural
sons
each
named
ptolemy
one
of
whom
reigned
in
cyprus
and
the
other
nicknamed
auletes
afterwards
gained
the
throne
of
egypt
on
the
death
of
lathyrus
or
ptolemy
soter
his
daughter
cleopatra
berenicê
the
widow
of
ptolemy
alexander
mounted
the
throne
of
egypt
in
but
it
was
also
claimed
by
her
stepson
the
young
alexander
who
was
then
living
in
rome
alexander
had
been
sent
to
the
island
of
cos
as
a
place
of
safety
when
his
grandmother
cleopatra
cocce
followed
her
army
into
but
as
the
egyptians
had
lost
the
command
of
the
sea
the
royal
treasure
in
cos
was
no
longer
out
of
danger
and
the
island
was
soon
afterwards
taken
by
mithridates
king
of
pontus
who
had
conquered
asia
minor
among
the
treasures
in
that
island
the
alexandrians
lost
one
of
the
sacred
relics
of
the
kingdom
the
chlamys
or
which
had
belonged
to
alexander
the
great
and
which
they
had
kept
with
religious
care
as
the
safeguard
of
the
empire
it
then
fell
into
the
hands
of
mithridates
and
on
his
overthrow
it
became
the
prize
of
pompey
who
wore
it
in
his
triumph
at
the
end
of
the
mithridatic
war
with
this
chlamys
as
had
always
been
foretold
by
the
believers
in
wonders
egypt
lost
its
rank
among
nations
and
the
command
of
the
world
passed
to
the
romans
who
now
possessed
this
symbol
of
sovereignty
alexander
also
at
that
time
fell
into
the
hands
of
mithridates
but
he
afterwards
escaped
and
reached
the
army
of
sulla
under
whose
care
he
lived
for
some
time
in
rome
the
alexandrian
prince
hoped
to
gain
the
throne
of
his
father
by
means
of
the
friendship
of
one
who
could
make
and
unmake
kings
at
his
pleasure
and
sulla
might
have
thought
that
the
wealth
of
egypt
would
be
at
his
command
by
means
of
his
young
friend
to
these
reasons
alexander
added
the
bribe
which
was
then
becoming
common
with
the
princes
who
held
their
thrones
by
the
help
of
rome
he
made
a
will
in
which
he
named
the
roman
people
as
his
heirs
and
the
senate
then
took
care
that
the
kingdom
of
egypt
should
be
a
part
of
the
wealth
which
was
afterwards
to
be
theirs
by
inheritance
after
berenicê
his
stepmother
had
been
queen
about
six
months
they
sent
him
to
alexandria
with
orders
that
he
should
be
received
as
king
and
to
soften
the
harshness
of
this
command
he
was
told
to
marry
berenicê
and
reign
jointly
with
her
the
orders
of
sulla
the
roman
dictator
were
of
course
obeyed
and
the
young
alexander
landed
at
alexandria
as
king
of
egypt
and
the
friend
of
rome
he
married
berenicê
and
on
the
nineteenth
day
of
his
reign
with
a
cruelty
unfortunately
too
common
in
this
history
he
put
her
to
death
the
marriage
had
been
forced
upon
him
by
the
romans
who
ordered
all
the
political
affairs
of
the
kingdom
but
as
they
took
no
part
in
the
civil
or
criminal
affairs
he
seems
to
have
been
at
liberty
to
murder
his
wife
but
alexander
was
hated
by
the
people
as
a
king
thrust
upon
them
by
foreign
arms
and
berenicê
whatever
they
might
have
before
thought
of
her
was
regretted
as
the
queen
of
their
choice
hence
his
crime
met
with
its
reward
his
own
guards
immediately
rose
upon
him
they
dragged
him
from
the
palace
to
the
gymnasium
and
there
put
him
to
death
though
the
romans
had
already
seized
the
smaller
kingdom
of
cyrene
under
the
will
of
ptolemy
apion
they
could
not
agree
among
themselves
upon
the
wholesale
robbery
of
taking
egypt
under
the
will
which
alexander
had
made
in
their
favour
they
seized
however
a
paltry
sum
of
money
which
he
had
left
at
tyre
as
a
place
of
safety
and
it
was
a
matter
of
debate
for
many
years
afterwards
in
rome
whether
they
should
not
claim
the
kingdom
of
egypt
but
the
nobles
of
rome
who
sold
their
patronage
to
kings
for
sums
equal
to
the
revenues
of
provinces
would
have
lost
much
by
handing
the
kingdom
over
to
the
senate
hence
the
egyptian
monarchy
was
left
standing
for
two
reigns
longer
on
the
death
of
ptolemy
alexander
the
alexandrians
might
easily
have
changed
their
weak
and
wicked
rulers
and
formed
a
government
for
themselves
if
they
had
known
how
the
legitimate
male
line
of
the
ptolemies
came
to
an
end
on
the
death
of
the
young
alexander
ii
the
two
natural
sons
of
soter
ii
were
then
the
next
in
succession
and
as
there
was
no
other
claimant
the
crown
fell
to
the
elder
he
was
young
perhaps
even
a
minor
under
the
age
of
fourteen
his
claims
had
been
wholly
overlooked
at
the
death
of
his
father
for
though
by
the
egyptian
law
every
son
was
held
to
be
equally
legitimate
it
was
not
so
by
the
macedonian
law
he
took
the
name
of
neus
dionysus
or
the
young
osiris
as
we
find
it
written
in
the
hieroglyphics
though
he
is
usually
called
auletes
a
name
afterwards
given
him
because
he
was
more
proud
of
his
skill
in
playing
on
the
flute
than
of
his
very
slender
knowledge
of
the
art
of
governing
it
was
in
this
reign
that
the
historian
diodorus
siculus
travelled
in
egypt
and
wrote
his
account
of
the
manners
and
religion
of
the
people
what
he
tells
us
of
the
early
egyptian
history
is
of
little
value
when
compared
with
the
history
by
manetho
who
was
a
native
of
the
country
and
could
read
the
hieroglyphic
records
or
even
with
that
by
herodotus
but
nevertheless
he
deserves
great
praise
and
our
warmest
thanks
for
being
nearly
the
first
greek
writer
when
egyptian
learning
could
no
longer
be
thought
valuable
when
the
religion
though
looked
down
upon
might
at
any
rate
be
studied
with
ease
for
being
nearly
the
first
writer
who
thought
the
manners
of
this
ancient
people
after
they
had
almost
passed
off
the
page
of
history
worth
the
notice
of
a
philosopher
diodorus
never
quotes
manetho
but
follows
herodotus
in
making
one
great
hero
for
the
chief
actions
of
antiquity
whom
he
calls
sesoosis
or
sesonchosis
to
him
he
assigns
every
great
work
of
which
the
author
was
unknown
the
canals
in
the
delta
the
statue
of
amenhôthes
the
obelisks
of
ramses
the
distant
navigation
under
necho
the
mounds
and
trenches
dug
against
assyrian
and
persian
invasion
and
even
the
great
ship
of
ptolemy
philopator
and
not
knowing
that
southern
arabia
and
even
ethiopia
had
by
the
alexandrians
been
sometimes
called
india
he
says
that
this
hero
conquered
even
india
beyond
the
ganges
on
the
other
hand
the
fabulous
conquest
of
the
great
serpent
the
enemy
of
the
human
race
which
we
see
sculptured
on
the
sarcophagus
of
oimenepthah
he
describes
as
an
historic
fact
of
the
reign
of
ptolemy
philadelphus
he
tells
us
how
this
huge
beast
feet
long
was
beaten
down
by
troops
of
archers
slingers
and
cavalry
and
brought
alive
in
a
net
to
alexandria
where
old
enemy
was
shown
in
a
cage
for
the
amusement
of
the
curious
citizens
memphis
was
then
a
great
city
in
its
crowded
streets
its
palaces
and
temples
it
was
second
only
to
alexandria
a
little
to
the
west
stood
the
pyramids
which
were
thought
one
of
the
seven
wonders
of
the
world
their
broad
bases
sloping
sides
and
solid
masonry
had
withstood
the
weather
for
ages
and
their
huge
unwieldy
stones
were
a
less
easy
quarry
for
after
builders
than
the
live
rock
when
nearer
to
the
side
the
priests
of
memphis
knew
the
names
of
the
kings
who
one
after
the
other
had
built
a
new
portico
to
their
great
temple
of
phtah
but
as
to
when
or
by
whom
the
pyramids
were
built
they
had
perhaps
less
knowledge
than
the
present
day
historian
the
modern
egyptologist
with
his
patient
investigation
assigns
the
largest
of
these
three
pyramids
to
khûfûi
or
kheops
a
famous
ruler
of
the
fourth
dynasty
and
the
others
were
erected
by
his
immediate
successors
the
temple
of
phtah
and
every
other
building
of
memphis
is
now
gone
and
near
the
spot
stands
the
great
city
of
cairo
whose
mosques
and
minarets
have
been
quarried
of
its
ruins
but
the
pyramids
still
stand
after
centuries
of
broken
and
changing
history
unbroken
and
unchanged
they
have
outlived
any
portion
of
time
that
their
builders
could
have
dreamed
of
but
their
worn
surface
no
longer
declares
to
us
their
names
and
history
their
sloping
sides
formed
to
withstand
attacks
have
not
saved
the
inscriptions
which
they
once
held
and
the
builders
in
thus
overlooking
the
reed
which
was
growing
in
their
marshes
the
papyrus
to
which
the
great
minds
of
greece
afterwards
trusted
their
undying
names
have
only
taught
us
how
much
safer
it
would
have
been
in
their
wish
to
be
thought
of
and
talked
of
in
after
ages
to
have
leaned
upon
the
poet
and
historian
the
beautiful
temples
of
dendera
and
latopolis
which
were
raised
by
the
untiring
industry
of
ages
and
finished
under
the
roman
emperors
were
begun
about
this
reign
though
some
of
the
temples
of
lower
egypt
had
fallen
into
decay
and
though
the
throne
was
then
tottering
to
its
fall
the
priests
in
upper
egypt
were
still
building
for
immortality
the
religion
of
the
kopts
was
still
flourishing
the
opinion
of
the
creation
was
the
growth
of
his
own
bank
the
thoughtful
man
who
saw
the
nile
every
year
lay
a
body
of
solid
manure
upon
his
field
was
able
to
measure
against
the
walls
of
the
old
temples
that
the
ground
was
slowly
but
certainly
rising
an
increase
of
the
earth
was
being
brought
about
by
the
river
hence
he
readily
believed
that
the
world
itself
had
of
old
been
formed
out
of
water
and
by
means
of
water
the
philosophers
were
nearly
of
the
same
opinion
they
held
that
matter
was
itself
eternal
like
the
other
gods
and
that
our
world
in
the
beginning
before
it
took
any
shape
upon
itself
was
like
thin
mud
or
a
mass
of
water
containing
all
things
that
were
afterwards
to
be
brought
forth
out
of
it
when
the
water
had
by
its
divine
will
separated
itself
from
the
earth
then
the
great
ra
the
sun
sent
down
his
quickening
heat
and
plants
and
animals
came
forth
out
of
the
as
the
insects
are
spawned
out
of
the
fields
before
the
eyes
of
the
husbandman
every
autumn
after
the
overflow
has
retreated
the
crafty
priests
of
the
nile
declared
that
they
had
themselves
visited
and
dwelt
in
the
caverns
beneath

that
they
might
spend
their
youth
in

retirement
and
as
it
was
said
in
these
caverns
beneath
his
waves
these
early
egyptian
myths
seem
to
have
influenced
the
compilers
of
the
hebrew
scriptures
the
author
of
the
book
of
genesis
tells
us
that
the
hebrew
god
formed
the
earth
and
its
inhabitants
by
dividing
the
land
from
the
water
and
then
commanding
them
both
to
bring
forth
living
creatures
and
again
one
of
the
psalmists
says
that
his
substance
while
yet
imperfect
was
by
the
creator
curiously
wrought
in
the
lowest
depths
of
the
earth
the
hebrew
writer
however
never
thinks
that
any
part
of
the
creation
was
its
own
creator
but
in
the
egyptian
philosophy
sunshine
and
the
river
nile
are
themselves
the
divine
agents
and
hence
fire
and
water
received
divine
honours
as
the
two
purest
of
the
elements
and
every
day
when
the
temple
of
serapis
in
alexandria
was
opened
the
singer
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
portico
sprinkled
water
over
the
marble
floor
while
he
held
forth
the
fire
to
the
people
and
though
he
and
most
of
his
hearers
were
greeks
he
called
upon
the
god
in
the
egyptian
language
the
inner
walls
of
the
temples
glittered
with
gold
and
silver
and
amber
and
sparkled
with
gems
from
ethiopia
and
india
and
the
recesses
were
veiled
with
rich
curtains
the
costliness
was
often
in
striking
contrast
with
the
chief
inmate
much
to
the
surprise
of
the
greek
traveller
who
having
leave
to
examine
a
temple
had
entered
the
sacred
rooms
and
asked
to
be
shown
the
image
of
the
god
for
whose
sake
it
was
built
one
of
the
priests
in
waiting
then
approached
with
a
solemn
look
chanting
a
hymn
and
pulling
aside
the
veil
allowed
him
to
peep
in
at
a
snake
a
crocodile
or
a
cat
or
some
other
beast
fitter
to
inhabit
a
bog
or
cavern
than
to
lie
on
a
purple
cushion
in
a
stately
palace
the
funerals
of
the
sacred
animals
were
celebrated
with
great
pomp
particularly
that
of
the
bull
apis
and
at
a
cost
in
one
case
of
one
hundred
talents
or
thousand
dollars
which
was
double
what
ptolemy
soter
in
his
wish
to
please
his
new
subjects
spent
upon
the
apis
of
his
day
after
the
funeral
the
priests
looked
for
a
calf
with
the
right
spots
and
when
they
had
found
one
they
fattened
it
for
forty
days
and
brought
it
to

a
boat
under
a

awning

lodged
it

the
religious

of
the
egyptians
were
much
warmer
and
stronger
than
those
of
the
greeks
or
romans
they
have
often
been
accused
of
eating
one
another
but
never
of
eating
a
sacred
animal
once
a
year
the
people
of
memphis
celebrated
the
birthday
of
apis
with
great
pomp
and
expense
and
one
of
the
chief
ceremonies
on
the
occasion
was
the
throwing
a
golden
dish
into
the
nile
during
the
week
that
these
rejoicings
lasted
while
the
sacred
river
was
appeased
by
gifts
the
crocodile
was
thought
to
lose
its
fierceness
its
teeth
were
harmless
and
it
never
attempted
to
bite
and
it
was
not
till
six
on
the
eighth
day
that
this
animal
again
became
an
object
of
fear
to
those
whose
occupations
brought
them
to
the
banks
of
the
nile
once
a
year
also
the
statues
of
the
gods
were
removed
from
their
pedestals
and
placed
in
barges
and
thus
carried
in
solemn
procession
along
the
nile
and
only
brought
back
to
the
temples
after
some
days
it
was
supposed
that
the
gods
were
passing
these
days
on
a
visit
to
the
righteous
ethiopians
the
cat
was
at
all
times
one
of
the
animals
held
most
sacred
by
the
egyptians
in
the
earliest
and
latest
times
we
find
the
statues
of
their
goddesses
with
heads
the
cats
of
alexandria
were
looked
upon
as
so
many
images
of
neith
or
the
minerva
of
saïs
a
goddess
worshipped
both
by
greeks
and
egyptians
and
it
passed
into
a
proverb
with
the
greeks
when
they
spoke
of
any
two
things
being
unlike
to
say
that
they
were
as
much
like
one
another
as
a
cat
was
to
minerva
it
is
to
alexandria
also
that
we
trace
the
story
of
a
cat
turned
into
a
lady
to
please
a
prince
who
had
fallen
in
love
with
it
the
lady
however
when
dressed
in
her
bridal
robes
could
not
help
scampering
about
the
room
after
a
mouse
seen
upon
the
floor
and
when
plutarch
was
in
egypt
it
had
already
become
a
proverb
that
any
one
in
too
much
finery
was
as
awkward
as
a
cat
in
a
robe
so
deeply
rooted
in
the
minds
of
the
egyptians
was
the
worship
of
these
animals
that
when
a
roman
soldier
had
killed
a
cat
unawares
though
the
romans
were
masters
of
the
country
the
people
rose
against
him
in
a
fury
in
vain
the
king
sent
a
message
to
quiet
the
mob
to
let
them
know
that
the
cat
was
killed
by
accident
and
though
the
fear
of
rome
would
most
likely
have
saved
a
roman
soldier
unharmed
whatever
other
crime
he
might
have
been
guilty
of
in
this
case
nothing
would
quiet
the
people
but
his
death
and
he
was
killed

the
eyes

so
much
from
its
greater
strength

skill

arms
as
from
its
higher
aim
and
stronger
wish
for
power
the
egyptians
we
see
had
not
lost
their
courage
and
when
the
occasion
called
them
out
they
showed
a
fearlessness
not
unworthy
of
their
theban
forefathers
on
seeing
a
dead
cat
in
the
streets
they
rose
against
the
orders
and
the
power
of
rome
had
they
thought
their
own
freedom
or
their
greatness
as
much
worth
fighting
for
they
could
perhaps
have
gained
them

but
the
egyptians
had
no
civil
laws
or
rights
that
they
cared
about
they
had
nothing
left
that
they
valued
but
their
religion
and
this
the
romans
took
good
care
not
to
meddle
with
had
the
romans
made
war
upon
the
priests
and
temples
as
the
persians
had
done
they
would
perhaps
in
the
same
way
have
been
driven
out
of
egypt
but
they
never
shocked
the
religious
feelings
of
the
people
and
even
after
egypt
had
become
a
roman
province
when
the
beautiful
temples
of
esne
dendera
and
other
cities
were
dedicated
in
the
names
of
the
roman
emperors
they
seldom
copied
the
example
of
philometor
and
put
greek
much
less
roman
writing
on
the
portico
but
continued
to
let
the
walls
be
covered
with
hieroglyphical
inscriptions
the
egyptians
when
rich
enough
to
pay
for
it
still
had
the
bodies
of
their
friends
embalmed
at
their
death
and
made
into
mummies
though
the
priests
to
save
part
of
the
cost
often
put
the
mummy
of
a
man
just
dead
into
a
which
had
been
made
and
used
in
the
reign
of
a
thûtmosis
or
an
amenhôthes
they
thought
that
every
man
at
his
death
took
upon
himself
the
character
of
osiris
that
the
nurses
who
laid
out
the
dead
body
represented
the
goddesses
isis
and
nepthys
while
the
man
who
made
the
mummy
was
supposed
to
be
the
god
anubis
when
the
embalming
was
finished
it
was
part
of
the
funeral
to
bring
the
dead
man
to
trial
for
what
he
had
done
when
living
and
thus
to
determine
whether
he
was
entitled
to
an
honourable
burial
the
mummy
was
ferried
across
the
lake
belonging
to
the
temple
and
taken
before
the
judge
osiris
a
pair
of
scales
was
brought
forth
by
the
anubis
and
the
horus
and
with
this
they
weighed
the
past
life
of
the
deceased
the
judge
with
the
advice
of
a
jury
of
then
pronounced
the
solemn
verdict
which
was
written
down
by
the
thot
but
human
nature
is
the
same
in
all
ages
and
in
all
countries
and
whatever
might
have
been
the
past
life
of
the
dead
the
judge
not
to
hurt
the
feelings
of
the
friends
always
declared
that
he
was
righteous
and
a
good
man
and
notwithstanding
the
show
of
truth
in
the
trial
it
passed
into
a
proverb
to
say
of
a
wicked
man
that
he
was
too
bad
to
be
praised
even
at
his
funeral
this
custom
of
embalming
was
thought
right
by
all
but
from
examining
the
mummies
that
have
come
down
to
us
it
would
seem
to
have
been
very
much
confined
to
the
priestly
families
and
seldom
used
in
the
case
of

the
mummies
however
were
highly
valued
by
the
survivors
of
the
family
and
when
from
poverty
any
man
was
driven
to
borrow
money
the

were
thought

by
the
lender

note

in

paid
by

this
was
at
a
time
when
the
foreign
trade
had
through
the
faults
of
the
government
sunk
down
to
its
lowest
ebb

sailed

the

that
it

than
three

what
it

even

is

reign
sobriety
was

crime

quiet
behaviour
was
thought
a
reproach
against
his
irregularities

platonic
philosopher
demetrius
was
in

being
put

seen
at
the
feast
of
bacchus
in
his
usual
dress
while
every
other
man
was
in
the
dress
of
a
woman
but
the
philosopher
was
allowed
to
disprove
the
charge
of
sobriety
or
at
least
to
make
amends
for
his
fault
and
on
the
king
sending
for
him
the
next
day
he
made
himself
drunk
publicly
in
the
sight
of
all
the
court
and
danced
with
cymbals
in
a
loose
dress
of
tarentine
gauze
but
so
few
are
the
deeds
worth
mentioning
in
the
falling
state
that
we
are
pleased
even
to
be
told
that
in
the
one
hundred
and
olympiad
strato
of
alexandria
conquered
in
the
olympic
games
and
was
crowned
in
the
same
day
for
wrestling
and
for
or
wrestling
and
boxing
joined
these
sports
being
considered
among
the
most
honourable
in
which
athletes
could
contend
in
the
thirteenth
year
of
this
reign
when
the
war
against
the
pirates
called
for
the
whole
naval
force
of
rome
pompey
sent
a
fleet
under
lentulus
marcellinus
to
clear
the
coast
and
creeks
of
egypt
from
these
robbers
the
egyptian
government
was
too
weak
to
guard
its
own
trade
and
lentulus
in
his
consulship
put
the
ptolemaic
eagle
and
thunderbolt
on
his
coins
to
show
that
he
had
exercised
an
act
of
sovereignty
three
years
later
we
again
meet
with
the
eagle
and
thunderbolt
on
the
consular
coins
of
aurelius
cotta
and
we
learn
from
cicero
that
in
that
year
it
was
found
necessary
to
send
a
fleet
to
alexandria
to
enforce
the
orders
of
the
senate
we
next
find
the
roman
senate
debating
whether
they
should
not
seize
the
kingdom
as
their
inheritance
under
the
wall
of
ptolemy
alexander
but
moved
by
the
bribes
of
auletes
and
perhaps
by
other
reasons
which
we
are
not
told
they
forbore
to
grasp
the
prize
in
this
difficulty
auletes
was
helped
by
the
great
pompey
to
whom
he
had
sent
an
embassy
with
a
golden
crown
wrorth
four
thousand
pieces
of
gold
which
met
him
at
damascus
on
his
syrian
campaign
he
then
formed
a
secret
treaty
with
mithridates
king
of
pontus
who
was
engaged
in
warfare
with
the
romans
their
common
enemy
auletes
was
now
a
widower
with
six
young
children
and
mithridates
had
two
daughters
and
accordingly
it
was
agreed
that
one
daughter
should
be
married
to
auletes
and
the
other
to
his
brother
the
king
of
cyprus
but
the
ruin
and
death
of
mithridates
broke
off
the
marriages
and
auletes
was
able
to
conceal
from
the
romans
that
he
had
ever
formed
an
alliance
with
their
enemy
in
the
year
which
was
made
famous
by
the
consulship
of
cicero
jerusalem
was
taken
by
the
roman
army
under
pompey
and
judæa
which
had
enjoyed
a
shortlived
freedom
of
less
than
one
hundred
years
under
the
maccabees
was
then
put
under
a
roman
governor
the
fortifications
of
the
temple
were
destroyed
this
was
felt
by
the
jews
of
lower
egypt
as
a
heavy
blow
and
from
this
time
their
sufferings
in
that
country
began
while
their
brethren
had
been
lords
of
judæa
they
had
held
up
their
heads
with
the
greeks
in
alexandria
but
upon
the
fall
of
jerusalem
they
sunk
down
to
the
rank
of
the
egyptians
they
thought
worse
of
themselves
and
they
were
thought
worse
of
by
others
the
egyptian
jews
were
very
closely
allied
to
the
people
of
the
delta
though
they
had
been
again
and
again
warned
by
their
prophets
not
to
mix
with
the
egyptians
they
seem
not
to
have
listened
to
the
warning
they
were
in
many
religious
points
less
strict
than
their
brethren
in
judæa
the
living
in
egypt
the
building
a
second
temple
and
the
using
a
greek
bible
were
all
breaches
if
not
of
the
law
at
least
of
the
tradition
they
surrounded
their
synagogues
with
sacred
groves
which
were
clearly
forbidden
by
moses
though
they
were
not
guilty
of
worshipping
images
yet
they
did
not
think
it
wrong
to
have
portraits
and
statues
of
themselves
in
their
dislike
of
pork
in
their
washings
and
in
other
eastern
customs
they
were
like
the
egyptians
and
hence
the
greeks
who
thought
them
both
barbarians
very
grudgingly
yielded
to
them
the
privileges
of
choosing
their
own
magistrates
of
having
their
own
courts
of
justice
and
the
other
rights
of
citizenship
which
the
policy
of
the
ptolemies
had
granted
the
jews
on
the
other
hand
in
whose
eyes
religion
was
everything
saw
the
greeks
and
egyptians
worshipping
the
same
gods
and
the
same
sacred
animals
and
felt
themselves
as
far
above
the
greeks
in
those
branches
of
philosophy
which
arise
out
of
religion
as
they
were
below
them
in
that
rank
which
is
gained
by
success
in
war
hence
it
was
with
many
heartburnings
and
not
without
struggles
which
shed
blood
in
the
streets
of
alexandria
that
they
found
themselves
in
the
years
which
ushered
in
the
christian
era
sinking
down
to
the
level
of
the
egyptians
and
losing
one
by
one
the
rights
of
macedonian
citizenship
during
these
years
auletes
had
been
losing
his
friends
and
weakening
his
government
and
at
last
when
he
refused
to
quarrel
with
the
senate
about
the
island
of
cyprus
the
egyptians
rose
against
him
in
arms
and
he
was
forced
to
fly
from
alexandria
he
took
ship
for
rome
and
in
his
way
there
he
met
cato
who
was
at
rhodes
on
his
voyage
to
cyprus
he
sent
to
cato
to
let
him
know
that
he
was
in
the
city
and
that
he
wished
to
see
him
but
the
roman
sent
word
back
that
he
was
unwell
and
that
if
the
king
wanted
to
speak
to
him
he
must
come
himself
this
was
not
a
time
for
auletes
to
quarrel
with
a
senator
when
he
was
on
his
way
to
rome
to
beg
for
help
against
his
subjects
so
he
was
forced
to
go
to
lodgings
who
did
not
even
rise
from
his
seat
when
the
king
entered
the
room
but
this
treatment
was
not
quite
new
to
auletes
in
his
flight
from
alexandria
in
disguise
and
without
a
servant
he
had
had
to
eat
brown
bread
in
the
cottage
of
a
peasant
and
he
now
learned
how
much
more
irksome
it
was
to
wait
upon
the
pleasure
of
a
roman
senator
cato
gave
him
the
best
advice
that
instead
of
going
to
rome
where
he
would
find
that
all
the
wealth
of
egypt
would
be
thought
a
bribe
too
small
for
the
greediness
of
the
senators
whose
votes
he
wanted
he
would
do
better
to
return
to
alexandria
and
make
peace
with
his
rebellious
subjects
auletes
however
went
on
to
italy
and
he
arrived
at
rome
in
the
year
of
his
reign
and
in
the
three
years
that
he
spent
there
in
courting
and
bribing
the
senators
he
learned
the
truth
of
statements
and
the
value
of
his
advice
his
brother
ptolemy
who
was
reigning
in
cyprus
was
not
even
so
well
treated
the
romans
passed
a
law
making
that
wealthy
island
a
roman
province
no
doubt
upon
the
plea
of
the
will
of
alexander
ii
and
the
illegitimacy
and
they
sent
cato
rather
against
his
will
to
turn
ptolemy
out
of
his
kingdom
ptolemy
gave
up
the
island
without
cato
being
called
upon
to
use
force
and
in
return
the
romans
made
him
high
priest
in
the
temple
of
the
paphian
venus
but
he
soon
put
himself
to
death
by
poison
canidius
crassus
who
had
been
employed
by
cato
in
this
affair
may
have
had
some
fighting
at
sea
with
the
egyptians
as
on
one
of
his
coins
we
see
on
one
side
a
crocodile
and
on
the
other
the
prow
of
a
ship
as
if
he
had
beaten
the
egyptian
fleet
in
the
mouth
of
the
nile
on
the
flight
of
their
king
the
rebellious
alexandrians
set
on
the
throne
the
two
eldest
of
his
daughters
cleopatra
tryphaena
and
berenicê
and
sent
an
embassy
at
the
head
of
which
was
dion
the
academic
philosopher
to
plead
their
cause
at
rome
against
the
king
but
the
gold
of
auletes
had
already
gained
the
senate
and
cicero
spoke
on
his
behalf
one
of
his
great
speeches
now
unfortunately
lost
in
which
he
rebutted
the
charge
that
auletes
was
at
all
to
be
blamed
for
the
death
of
alexander
whom
he
thought
justly
killed
by
his
guards
for
the
murder
of
his
queen
and
kinswoman
cæsar
whose
year
of
consulship
was
then
drawing
to
an
end
took
his
part
warmly
and
auletes
became
in
debt
to
him
in
the
sum
of
seventeen
million
drachmas
or
nearly
two
and
a
half
million
dollars
either
for
money
lent
to
bribe
the
senators
or
for
bonds
then
given
to
cæsar
instead
of
money
by
these
means
auletes
got
his
title
acknowledged
the
door
of
the
senate
was
shut
against
the
alexandrian
ambassadors
and
the
philosopher
dion
the
head
of
the
embassy
was
poisoned
in
rome
by
the
slaves
of
his
friend
lucceius
in
whose
house
he
was
dwelling
but
nevertheless
auletes
was
not
able
to
get
an
army
sent
to
help
him
against
his
rebellious
subjects
and
his
daughters
nor
was
cæsar
able
to
get
from
the
senate
for
the
employment
of
his
proconsular
year
the
task
of
replacing
auletes
on
the
throne
this
high
employment
was
then
sought
for
both
by
lentulus
and
by
pompey
the
senate
at
first
leaned
in
favour
of
the
former
and
he
would
perhaps
have
gained
it
if
the
roman
creditors
of
auletes
who
were
already
trembling
for
their
money
had
not
bribed
openly
in
favour
of
pompey
as
the
more
powerful
of
the
two
on
pompey
therefore
the
choice
of
the
senate
at
last
fell
pompey
then
took
auletes
into
his
house
as
his
friend
and
guest
and
would
have
got
orders
to
lead
him
back
into
his
kingdom
at
the
head
of
a
roman
army
had
not
the
tribunes
of
the
people
fearing
any
addition
to
great
power
had
recourse
to
their
usual
the
sibylline
books
and
the
pontifex
at
their
bidding
publicly
declared
that
it
was
written
in
those
sacred
pages
that
the
king
of
egypt
should
have
the
friendship
of
rome
but
should
not
be
helped
with
an
army
but
though
lentulus
and
pompey
were
each
strong
enough
to
stop
the
other
from
having
this
high
command
auletes
was
not
without
hopes
that
some
roman
general
would
be
led
by
the
promise
of
money
and
by
the
honour
to
undertake
his
cause
though
it
would
be
against
the
laws
of
rome
to
do
so
without
orders
from
the
senate
cicero
then
took
him
under
his
protection
and
carried
him
in
a
litter
of
state
to
his
villa
at
baiæ
and
wrote
to
lentulus
the
proconsul
of
cilicia
and
cyprus
strongly
urging
him
to
snatch
the
glory
of
replacing
auletes
on
the
throne
and
of
being
the
patron
of
the
king
of
egypt
but
lentulus
seems
not
to
have
chosen
to
run
the
risk
of
so
far
breaking
the
laws
of
his
country
auletes
then
went
with
pressing
letters
from
pompey
to
gabinius
the
proconsul
of
syria
and
offered
him
the
large
bribe
of
ten
thousand
talents
or
seven
and
a
half
million
dollars
if
he
would
lead
the
roman
army
into
egypt
and
replace
him
on
the
throne
most
of
the
officers
were
against
this
undertaking
but
the
letters
of
pompey
the
advice
of
mark
antony
the
master
of
the
horse
and
perhaps
the
greatness
of
the
bribe
outweighed
those
cautious
opinions
while
auletes
had
been
thus
pleading
his
cause
at
rome
and
with
the
army
cleopatra
tryphæna
the
elder
of
the
two
queens
had
died
and
as
no
one
of
the
other
children
of
auletes
was
old
enough
to
be
joined
with
berenicê
on
the
throne
the
alexandrians
sent
to
syria
for
seleucus
the
son
of
antiochus
grypus
and
of
selene
the
sister
of
lathyrus
to
come
to
egypt
and
marry
berenicê
he
was
in
all
his
pleasures
and
tastes
and
got
the
nickname
of
the
scullion
he
was
even
said
to
have
stolen
the
golden
sarcophagus
in
which
the
body
of
alexander
was
buried
and
was
so
much
disliked
by
his
young
wife
that
she
had
him
strangled
on
the
fifth
day
after
their
marriage
berenicê
then
married
archelaus
a
son
of
mithridates
eupator
king
of
pontus
and
she
had
reigned
one
year
with
her
sister
and
two
years
with
her
husbands
when
the
roman
army
brought
back
her
father
ptolemy
auletes
into
egypt
gabinius
on
marching
gave
out
as
an
excuse
for
quitting
the
province
entrusted
to
him
by
the
senate
that
it
was
in
and
that
syria
was
in
danger
from
the
egyptian
fleet
commanded
by
archelaus
he
was
accompanied
by
a
jewish
army
under
the
command
of
antipator
sent
by
hyrcanus
whom
the
romans
had
just
made
governor
of
judæa
mark
antony
was
sent
forward
with
the
horse
and
routed
the
egyptian
army
near
pelusium
and
then
entered
the
city
with
auletes
the
king
in
the
cruelty
of
his
revenge
wished
to
put
the
citizens
to
the
sword
and
was
only
stopped
by
forbidding
it
the
egyptian
army
was
at
this
time
in
the
lowest
state
of
discipline
it
was
the
only
place
where
the
sovereign
was
not
despotic
the
soldiers
who
prized
the
lawlessness
of
their
trade
even
more
than
its
pay
were
a
cause
of
fear
only
to
their
when
archelaus
led
them
out
against
the
romans
and
ordered
them
to
throw
up
a
trench
around
their
camp
they
refused
to
obey
they
said
that
was
not
work
for
soldiers
but
that
it
ought
to
be
done
at
the
cost
of
the
state
hence
when
on
this
first
success
gabinius
followed
with
the
body
of
the
army
he
easily
conquered
the
rest
of
the
country
and
put
to
death
berenicê
and
archelaus
he
then
led
back
the
army
into
his
province
of
syria
but
left
behind
him
a
body
of
troops
under
lucius
septimius
to
guard
the
throne
of
auletes
and
to
check
the
risings
of
the
alexandrians
gabinius
had
refused
to
undertake
this
affair
which
was
the
more
dangerous
because
against
the
laws
of
rome
unless
the
large
bribe
were
first
paid
down
in
money
he
would
take
no
promises
and
auletes
who
in
his
banishment
had
no
money
at
his
command
had
to
borrow
it
of
some
one
who
would
listen
to
his
large
promises
of
after
payment
he
found
this
person
in
rabirius
posthumus
who
had
before
lent
him
money
and
who
saw
that
it
would
be
all
lost
unless
auletes
regained
the
throne
rabirius
therefore
lent
him
all
he
was
worth
and
borrowed
the
rest
from
his
friends
and
as
soon
as
auletes
was
on
the
throne
he
went
to
alexandria
to
claim
his
money
and
his
reward
illustration
vocal
statue
of
memnon
while
auletes
still
stood
in
need
of
roman
help
and
saw
the
advantage
of
keeping
faith
with
his
foreign
creditors
rabirius
was
allowed
to
hold
the
office
of
royal
or
which
was
one
of
great
state
and
profit
and
one
by
which
he
could
in
time
have
repaid
himself
his
loan
he
wore
a
royal
robe
the
taxes
of
alexandria
went
through
his
hands
he
was
indeed
master
of
the
city
but
when
the
king
felt
safe
on
his
throne
he
sent
away
his
troublesome
creditor
who
returned
to
rome
with
the
loss
of
his
money
to
stand
his
trial
as
a
state
criminal
for
having
lent
it
rabirius
had
been
for
a
time
mortgagee
in
possession
of
the
revenues
of
egypt
and
auletes
had
felt
more
indebted
for
his
crown
to
a
roman
citizen
than
to
the
senate
but
in
the
dealings
of
rome
with
foreign
kings
these
evils
had
often
before
arisen
and
at
last
been
made
criminal
and
while
gabinius
was
tried
for
treason
for
leading
his
army
out
of

the

alexandria
had

a

place

settlement
for
such

either
through

were
forced
to
leave

found
a
place
of
safety
in
alexandria
and
by
enrolling
themselves
in
the
egyptian
army
they
joined
in
bonds
of
fellowship
with
thousands
like
themselves
who
made
it
a
point

honour
to
screen
one

from
being

with

bands

robbers
from
syria
and
cilicia
had
the
ranks
of
the
egyptian
army
latterly
been
recruited
these
were
now
joined
by
a
number
of
soldiers
and
officers
from
the
army
of
gabinius
who
liked
the
egyptian
high
pay
and
lawlessness
better
than
the
strict
discipline
of
the
romans
as
in
this
mixed
body
of
men
the
more
regular
courage
and
greater
skill
in
war
was
found
among
the
romans
they
were
chiefly
chosen
as
officers
and
the
whole
had
something
of
the
form
of
a
roman
army
these
soldiers
in
alexandria
were
above
all
law
and
discipline
the
laws
were
everywhere
badly
enforced
crimes
passed
unpunished
and
property
became
unsafe
robberies
were
carried
on
openly
and
the
only
hope
of
recovering
what
was
stolen
was
by
buying
it
back
from
the
thief
in
many
cases
whole
villages
lived
upon
plunder
and
for
that
purpose
formed
themselves
into
a
society
and
put
themselves
under
the
orders
of
a
chief
and
when
any
merchant
or
husbandman
was
robbed
he
applied
to
this
chief
who
usually
restored
to
him
the
stolen
property
on
payment
of
of
its
value
as
the
country
fell
off
in
wealth
power
and
population
the
schools
of
alexandria
fell
off
in
learning
and

meet
with
few
authors
whose
names

of

apollonius

zopyrus

wrote
a
treatise
on

dedicated
his

agreeably
to

he
had
sent
one
copy
of

pompey
in

for

power
was
by
that
time
drawing
to
an
end
and
the
votes
of
the

could
give
no
strength
to
the
weak
hence
the
eunuch
pothinus
who
had
the
care
of
the
elder
ptolemy
was
governor
of
egypt
and
his

act
was
to
declare

to
set
at

which
cleopatra
was

cleopatra
fled
into
syria
and
with
a
manly
spirit
which
showed
what
she
was
afterwards
to
be
raised
an
army
and
marched
back
to
the
borders
of
egypt
to
claim
her
rights
by
force
of
arms
it
was
in
the
fourth
year
of

the
egyptian
troops
were
moved

and
the

were
within

that
pompey

had
been
the
friend
of
auletes
when
the

landed
on
the

egypt
in
distress
and
almost
alone
his
army
had
just
been
beaten
at
pharsalia
and
he
was
flying
from
cæsar
and
he
hoped
to
receive
from
the
son
the
kindness
which
he
had
shown
to
the
father
but
gratitude
is
a
virtue
little
known
in
palaces
and
ptolemy
had
been
cradled
in
princely
selfishness
in
this
civil
war
between
pompey
and
cæsar
the
alexandrians
would
have
been
glad
to
be
the
friends
of
both
but
that
was
now
out
of
the
question
coming
made
it
necessary
for
them
to
choose

precluded
an
answer
to
the

how
cæsar
would
have
dealt
with
the
captive

but
while
the
human
sympathy
which
still
found
a
place
in
the
great
soul
of
cæsar
side
by
side
with
ambition
enjoined
that
he
should
spare
his
former
friend
his
interest
also
required
that
he
should
annihilate
pompey
otherwise
than
by
the
executioner
pompey
had
been
for
twenty
years
the
acknowledged
ruler
of
rome
a
dominion
so
deeply
rooted
does
not
end
with
the
death
the
death
of
pompey
did
not
break
up
the
pompeians
but
gave
to
them
instead
of
an
aged
incapable
and
chief
in
his
sons
gnacus
and
sextus
two
leaders
both
of
whom
were
young
and
active
and
the
second
of
them
of
decided
capacity
to
the
newly
founded
hereditary
monarchy
hereditary
pretendership
attached
itself
at
once
like
a
parasite
and
it
was
very
doubtful
whether
by
this
change
of
persons
cæsar
did
not
lose
more
than
he
gained
meanwhile
in
egypt
cæsar
had
now
nothing
further
to
do
and
the
romans
and
egyptians
expected
that
he
would
immediately
set
sail
and
apply
himself
to
the
subjugation
of
africa
and
to
the
huge
task
of
organisation
which
awaited
him
after
the
victory
but
cæsar
faithful
to
his
custom
wherever
he
found
himself
in
the
wide
empire
of
finally
regulating
matters
at
once
and
in
person
and
firmly
convinced
that
no
resistance
was
to
be
expected
either
from
the
roman
garrison
or
from
the
court
being
moreover
in
urgent
pecuniary
embarrassment
landed
in
alexandria
with
the
two
amalgamated
legions
accompanying
him
to
the
number
of
hundred
men
and
eight
hundred
celtic
and
german
cavalry
took
up
his
quarters
in
the
royal
palace
and
proceeded
to
collect
the
necessary
sums
of
money
and
to
regulate
the
egyptian
succession
without
allowing
himself
to
be
disturbed
by
the
saucy
remark
of
pothinus
that
cæsar
should
not
for
such
petty
matters
neglect
his
own
so
important
affairs
in
his
dealings
with
the
egyptians
he
was
just
and
even
indulgent
although
the
aid
which
they
had
given
to
pompey
justified
the
imposing
of
a
war
contribution
the
exhausted
land
was
spared
from
this
and
while
the
arrears
of
the
sums
stipulated
for
in
and
since
then
only
about
half
paid
were
remitted
there
was
required
merely
a
final
payment
of
ten
million
denarii
two
million
dollars
the
belligerent
brother
and

were
enjoined
immediately
to
suspend
hostilities
and
were
invited
to
have
their
dispute
investigated
and
decided
before
the
arbiter
they
submitted
the
royal
boy
was
already
in
the
palace
and
cleopatra
also
presented
herself
there
cæsar
adjudged
the
kingdom
of
egypt
agreeably
to
the
testament
of
auletes
to
the
intermarried
brother
and
sister
cleopatra
and
ptolomoreus
dionysus
and
further
gave
unasked
the
kingdom
of
cyprus
cancelling
the
earlier
act
of
annexation
as
the
appanage
of
the
of
egypt
to
the
younger
children
of
auletes
arsinoë
and
ptolemy
the
younger
but
a
storm
was
secretly
preparing
alexandria
was
a
cosmopolitan
city
as
well
as
rome
hardly
inferior
to
the
italian
capital
in
the
number
of
its
inhabitants
far
superior
to
it
in
stirring
commercial
spirit
in
skill
of
handicraft
in
taste
for
science
and
art
in
the
citizens
there
was
a
lively
sense
of
their
own
national
importance
and
if
there
was
no
political
sentiment
there
was
at
any
rate
a
turbulent
spirit
which
induced
them
to
indulge
in
their
street
riots
regularly
and
heartily
we
may
conceive
their
feeling
when
they
saw
the
roman
general
ruling
in
the
palace
of
the
lagids
and
their
kings
accepting
the
award
of
his
tribunal
pothinus
and
the
both
as
may
be
conceived
very
dissatisfied
at
once
with
the
peremptory
requisition
of
all
debts
and
with
the
intervention
in
the
which
could
only
issue
as
it
did
in
the
favour
of
cleopatra
sent
in
order
to
pacify
the
roman
demands
the
treasures
of
the
temple
and
the
gold
plate
of
the
king
with
intentional
ostentation
to
be
melted
at
the
mint
with
increasing
indignation
the
egyptians
who
were
pious
even
to
superstition
and
who
rejoiced
in
the
magnificence
of
their
court
as
if
it
were
a
possession
of
their
own
beheld
the
bare
walls
of
their
temples
and
the
wooden
cups
on
the
table
of
their
king
the
roman
army
of
occupation
also
which
had
been
essentially
denationalised
by
its
long
abode
in
egypt
and
the
many
intermarriages
between
the
soldiers
and
egyptian
women
and
which
moreover
numbered
a
multitude
of
the
old
soldiers
of
pompey
and
runaway
italian
criminals
and
slaves
in
its
ranks
was
indignant
at
cæsar
by
whose
orders
it
had
been
obliged
to
suspend
its
action
on
the
syrian
frontier
and
at
his
handful
of
haughty
legionaries
the
tumult
even
at
the
landing
when
the
multitude
saw
the
roman
axes
carried
into
the
old
palace
and
the
numerous
instances
in
which
his
soldiers
were
assassinated
in
the
city
had
taught
cæsar
the
immense
danger
in
which
he
was
placed
with
his
small
force
in
presence
of
the
exasperated
multitude
but
it
was
difficult
to
return
on
account
of
the
northwest
winds
prevailing
at
this
season
of
the
year
and
the
attempt
of
embarkation
might
easily
become
a
signal
for
the
outbreak
of
the
insurrection
besides
it
was
not
the
nature
of
cæsar
to
take
his
departure
without
having
accomplished
his
work
he
accordingly
ordered
up
at
once
reinforcements
from
asia
and
meanwhile
till
these
arrived
made
a
show
of
the
utmost
never
was
there
greater
gaiety
in
his
camp
than
during
this
rest
at
alexandria
and
while
the
beautiful
and
clever
cleopatra
was
not
sparing
of
her
charms
in
general
and
least
of
all
towards
her
judge
cæsar
also
appeared
among
all
his
victories
to
value
most
those
won
over
beautiful
women
it
was
a
merry
prelude
to
graver
scenes
under
the
leadership
of
achilles
and
as
was
afterwards
proved
by
the
secret
orders
of
the
king
and
his
guardian
the
roman
army
of
occupation
stationed
in
egypt
appeared
unexpectedly
in
alexandria
and
as
soon
as
the
citizens
saw
that
it
had
come
to
attack
cæsar
they
made
common
cause
with
the
soldiers
with
a
presence
of
mind
which
in
some
measure
justifies
his
foolhardiness
cæsar
hastily
collected
his
scattered
men
seized
the
persons
of
the
king
and
his
ministers
entrenched
himself
in
the
royal
residence
and
adjoining
theatre
and
gave
orders
as
there
was
no
time
to
place
in
safety
the
stationed
in
the
principal
harbour
immediately
in
front
of
the
theatre
that
it
should
be
set
on
fire
and
that
pharos
the
island
with
the
commanding
the
harbour
should
be
occupied
by
means
of
boats
thus
at
least
a
restricted
position
for
defence
was
secured
and
the
way
was
kept
open
to
procure
supplies
and
reinforcements
at
the
same
time
orders
were
issued
to
the
commandant
of
asia
minor
as
well
as
to
the
nearest
subject
countries
the
syrians
and
the
nabatæans
the
cretans
and
the
rhodians
to
send
men
and
ships
in
all
haste
to
egypt
the
insurrection
at
the
head
of
which
the
princess
arsinoë
and
her
confidant
the
eunuch
ganymedes
had
placed
themselves
meanwhile
had
free
course
in
all
egypt
and
in
the
greater
part
of
the
capital
in
the
streets
of
the
latter
there
was
daily
fighting
but
without
success
either
on
the
part
of
cæsar
in
gaining
freer
scope
and
breaking
through
to
the
fresh
water
lake
of
mariut
which
lay
behind
the
town
where
he
could
have
provided
himself
with
water
and
forage
or
on
the
part
of
the
alexandrians
in
acquiring
superiority
in
besieging
and
depriving
them
of
all
drinking
water
for
when
the
nile
canals
in
part
of
the
town
had
been
spoiled
by
the
introduction
of

drinkable
water
was
unexpectedly
found
in
wells
dug
on
the
beach
as
cæsar
was
not
to
be
overcome
from
the
landward
side
the
exertions
of
the
besiegers
were
directed
to
destroy
his
fleet
and
cut
him
off
from
the

by
which
supplies
reached
him

and
the
east
harbour
while
the
mole
and
the
west
harbour
were
in
possession
of
the
citizens
and
as
the
alexandrian
fleet
was
burnt
his
vessels
sailed
in
and
out
without
hindrance
the
alexandrians
after
having
vainly
attempted
to
introduce
from
the
western
into
the
eastern
harbour
equipped
with
the
remnant
of
their
arsenal
a
small
squadron
and
with
this
blocked
up
the
way
of
vessels
when
these
were
towing
in
a
fleet
of
transports
with
a
legion
that
had
arrived
from
asia
minor
but
the
excellent
rhodian
mariners
of
cæsar
mastered
the
enemy
not
long
afterwards
however
the
citizens
captured
the
and
from
that
point
totally
closed
the
narrow
and
rocky
mouth
of
the
east
harbour
for
larger
ships
so
that
fleet
was
compelled
to
take
its
station
in
the
open
roads
before
the
east
harbour
and
his
communication
with
the
sea
hung
only
on
a
weak
thread
fleet
attacked
in
that
roadstead
repeatedly
by
the
superior
naval
force
of
the
enemy
could
neither
shun
the
unequal
strife
since
the
loss
of
the
closed
the
inner
harbour
against
it
nor
yet
withdraw
for
the
loss
of
the
roadstead
would
have
debarred
cæsar
wholly
from
the
sea
though
the
brave
legionaries
supported
by
the
dexterity
of
the
rhodian
sailors
had
always
hitherto
decided
these
conflicts
in
favour
of
the
romans
the
alexandrians
renewed
and
augmented
their
naval
armaments
with
unwearied
perseverance
the
besieged
had
to
fight
as
often
as
it
pleased
the
besiegers
and
if
the
former
should
be
on
a
signal
occasion
vanquished
cæsar
would
be
totally
hemmed
in
and
probably
lost
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
make
an
attempt
to
recover
the
the
double
attack
which
was
made
by
boats
from
the
side
of
the
harbour
and
by
the
from
the
seaboard
in
reality
brought
not
only
the
island
but
also
the
lower
part
of
the
mole
into
his
power
it
was
only
at
the
second
of
the
mole
that
cæsar
ordered
the
attack
to
be
stopped
and
the
mole
to
be
there
closed
towards
the
city
by
a
transverse
wall
but
while
a
violent
conflict
arose
here
round
the
entrenchers
the
roman
troops
left
the
lower
part
of
the
mole
adjoining
the
island
bare
of
defenders
a
division
of
egyptians
landed
there
unexpectedly
attacked
in
the
rear
the
roman
soldiers
and
sailors
crowded
together
on
the
mole
of
the
transverse
wall
and
drove
the
whole
mass
in
wild
confusion
into
the
sea
a
part
were
taken
on
board
by
the
roman
ships
but
more
were
drowned
some
four
hundred
soldiers
and
a
still
greater
number
of
men
belonging
to
the
fleet
were
sacrificed
on
this
day
the
general
himself
who
had
shared
the
fate
of
his
men
had
been
obliged
to
seek
refuge
in
his
ship
and
when
this
sank
from
having
been
overloaded
with
men
he
had
to
save
himself
by
swimming
to
another
but
severe
as
was
the
loss
suffered
it
was
amply
compensated
by
the
recovery
of
the
which
along
with
the
mole
as
far
as
the
first
remained
in
the
hands
of
cæsar
at
length
the
relief
arrived
mithridates
of
pergamus
an
able
warrior
of
the
school
of
mithridates
eupator
whose
natural
son
he
claimed
to
be
brought
up
by
land
from
syria
a
motley
army
the
ituræans
of
the
prince
of
the
libanus
the
bedouins
of
jamblichus
son
of
sampsiceramus
the
jews
under
the
minister
antipater
and
the
contingents
generally
of
the
petty
chiefs
and
communities
of
cilicia
and
syria
from
pelusium
which
mithridates
had
the
fortune
to
occupy
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
he
took
the
great
road
towards
memphis
with
the
view
of
avoiding
the
intersected
ground
of
the
delta
and
crossing
the
nile
before
its
division
during
which
movement
his
troops
received
manifold
support
from
the
jewish
peasants
who
were
settled
in
this
part
of
egypt
the
egyptians
with
the
young
king
ptolemy
now
at
their
head
whom
cæsar
had
released
to
his
people
in
the
vain
hope
of
allaying
the
insurrection
by
his
means
despatched
an
army
to
the
nile
to
detain
mithridates
on
its
farther
bank
the
army
fell
in
with
the
enemy
even
beyond
memphis
at
the
camp
between
onion
and
heliopolis
nevertheless
mithridates
trained
in
the
roman
fashion
of
manoeuvring
and
encamping
amidst
successful
conflicts
gained
the
opposite
bank
at
memphis
cæsar
on
the
other
hand
as
soon
as
he
obtained
news
of
the
arrival
of
the
relieving
army
conveyed
a
part
of
his
troops
in
ships
to
the
end
of
the
lake
of
morea
to
the
west
of
alexandria
and
marched
round
this
lake
and
down
the
nile
to
meet
mithridates
advancing
up
the
river
the
junction
took
place
without
the
enemy
attempting
to
hinder
it
cæsar
then
marched
into
the
delta
whither
the
king
had
retreated
overthrew
notwithstanding
the
deeply
cut
canal
in
their
front
the
egyptian
vanguard
at
the
first
onset
and
immediately
stormed
the
egyptian
camp
itself
it
lay
at
the
foot
of
a
rising
ground
between
the
nile
from
which
only
a
narrow
path
separated
it
and
marshes
difficult
of
access
cæsar
caused
the
camp
to
be
assailed
simultaneously
from
the
front
and
from
the
flank
on
the
path
along
the
nile
and
during
this
assault
ordered
a
third
detachment
to
ascend
unseen
the
heights
of
the
camp
the
victory
was
complete
the
camp
was
taken
and
those
of
the
egyptians
who
did
not
fall
beneath
the
sword
of
the
enemy
were
drowned
in
the
attempt
to
escape
to
the
fleet
on
the
nile
with
one
of
the
boats
which
sank
overladen
with
men
the
young
king
also
disappeared
in
the
waters
of
his
native
stream
immediately
after
the
battle
cæsar
advanced
at
the
head
of
his
cavalry
from
the
land
side
straight
into
the
portion
of
the
capital
occupied
by
the
egyptians
in
mourning
attire
with
the
images
of
their
gods
in
their
hands
the
enemy
received
him
and
sued
for
peace
and
his
troops
when
they
saw
him
return
as
victor
from
the
side
opposite
to
that
by
which
he
had
set
forth
welcomed
him
with
boundless
joy
the
fate
of
the
town
which
had
ventured
to
thwart
the
plans
of
the
master
of
the
world
and
had
brought
him
within
a
of
destruction
lay
in
hands
but
he
was
too
much
of
a
ruler
to
be
sensitive
and
dealt
with
the
alexandrians
as
with
the
massiliots
cæsar
pointing
to
their
city
severely
devastated
and
deprived
of
its
granaries
of
its
library
and
of
other
important
public
buildings
on
the
occasion
of
the
burning
of
the
fleet
exhorted
the
inhabitants
in
future
earnestly
to
cultivate
the
arts
of
peace
alone
and
to
heal
the
wounds
inflicted
on
themselves
for
the
rest
he
contented
himself
with
granting
to
the
jews
settled
in
alexandria
the
same
rights
which
the
greek
population
of
the
city
enjoyed
and
with
placing
in
alexandria
instead
of
the
previous
roman
army
of
occupation
which
nominally
at
least
obeyed
the
kings
of
egypt
a
roman
garrison
two
of
the
legions
besieged
there
and
a
third
which
afterwards
arrived
from
syria
under
a
commander
nominated
by
himself
for
this
position
of
trust
a
man
was
purposely
selected
whose
birth
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
abuse
it
rufio
an
able
soldier
but
the
son
of
a
freed
man
cleopatra
and
her
younger
brother
ptolemy
obtained
the
sovereignty
of
egypt
under
the
supremacy
of
rome
the
princess
arsinoë
was
carried
off
to
italy
that
she
might
not
serve
once
more
as
a
pretext
for
insurrections
to
the
egyptians
who
were
after
the
oriental
fashion
quite
as
much
devoted
to
their
dynasty
as
they
were
indifferent
towards
the
individual
dynasts
and
cyprus
became
again
a
part
of
the
roman
province
of
cilicia
love
for
cleopatra
who
had
just
borne
him
a
son
named
cæsarion
was
not
so
strong
as
his
ambition
and
after
having
been
above
a
year
in
egypt
he
left
her
to
govern
the
kingdom
in
her
own
name
but
on
his
behalf
and
sailed
for
italy
taking
with
him
the
sixth
legion
while
engaged
in
this
warfare
in
alexandria
cæsar
had
been
appointed
dictator
in
rome
where
his
power
was
exercised
by
mark
antony
his
master
of
the
horse
and
for
above
six
months
he
had
not
written
one
letter
home
as
though
ashamed
to
write
about
the
foolish
difficulty
he
had
entangled
himself
in
until
he
had
got
out
of
it
on
reaching
rome
cæsar
amused
the
people
and
himself
with
a
grand
triumphal
show
in
which
among
the
other
prisoners
of
war
the
princess
arsinoë
followed
his
car
in
chains
and
among
the
works
of
art
and
nature
which
were
got
together
to
prove
to
the
gazing
crowd
the
greatness
of
his
conquests
was
that
remarkable
african
animal
the
camelopard
then
for
the
first
time
seen
in
rome
in
one
chariot
was
a
statue
of
the
nile
god
and
in
another
the
pharos
lighthouse
on
fire
with
painted
flames
nor
was
this
the
last
of
triumphs
for
soon
afterwards
cleopatra
and
her
brother
ptolemy
then
twelve
years
old
who
was
called
her
husband
came
to
rome
as
his
guests
and
dwelt
for
some
time
with
him
in
his
house
the
history
of
egypt
at
this
time
is
almost
lost
in
that
of
rome
within
five
years
of
landing
in
alexandria
and
finding
that
by
the
death
of
pompey
he
was
master
of
the
world
he
paid
his
own
life
as
the
forfeit
for
crushing
his
liberty
the
queen
of
egypt
with
her
infant
son
cæsarion
about
four
years
old
was
then
in
rome
living
with
cæsar
in
his
villa
on
the
farther
side
of
the
tiber
on
death
her
first
wish
was
to
get
the
child
acknowledged
by
the
roman
senate
as
her
colleague
on
the
throne
of
egypt
and
as
a
friend
of
the
roman
people
with
this
view
she
applied
to
cicero
for
help
making
him
an
offer
of
some
books
or
works
of
art
but
he
was
offended
at
her
haughtiness
and
refused
her
gifts
besides
she
was
more
likely
to
thwart
than
to
help
the
cause
for
which
he
was
struggling
he
was
alarmed
at
hearing
that
she
was
soon
to
give
birth
to
another
child
he
did
not
want
any
more
cæsars
he
hoped
she
would
miscarry
as
he
wished
she
had
before
miscarried
so
he
bluntly
refused
to
undertake
her
cause
on
this
she
thought
herself
unsafe
in
rome
she
fled
privately
and
reached
egypt
in
safety
with
cæsarion
but
we
hear
of
no
second
child
by
julius
the
romans
were
now
the
masters
of
egypt
and
cleopatra
could
hardly
hope
to
reign
but
by
the
help
of
one
of
the
great
generals
who
were
struggling
for
the
sovereignty
of
the
republic
among
these
was
the
young
sextus
pompeius
whose
large
fleet
made
him
for
a
time
master
of
sicily
and
of
the
sea
and
he
was
said
to
have
been
admitted
by
the
queen
of
egypt
as
a
lover
but
he
was
able
to
be
of
but
little
use
to
her
in
return
for
her
favours
as
his
fleet
was
soon
defeated
by
octavianus
cæsar
had
left
behind
him
in
the
neighbourhood
of
alexandria
a
large
body
of
roman
troops
in
the
pay
and
nominally
under
the
orders
of
cleopatra
but
in
reality
to
keep
egypt
in
obedience
there
they
lived
as
if
above
all
egyptian
law
or
roman
discipline
indulging
in
the
vices
of
that
luxurious
capital
when
some
of
them
in
a
riot
in
the
year
killed
two
sons
of
bibulus
the
consul
cleopatra
was
either
afraid
or
unable
to
punish
the
murderers
the
most
she
could
do
was
to
get
them
sent
in
chains
into
syria
to
the
grieving
father
who
with
true
greatness
of
mind
sent
them
back
to
the
egyptian
legions
saying
that
it
was
for
the
senate
to
punish
them
not
for
him
while
ptolemy
her
second
husband
was
a
boy
and
could
claim
no
share
of
the
government
he
was
allowed
to
live
with
all
the
outward
show
of
royalty
but
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
age
of
fifteen
in
at
which
he
might
call
himself
her
equal
and
would
soon
be
her
master
cleopatra
had
him
put
to
death
she
had
then
reigned
four
years
with
her
elder
brother
and
four
years
with
her
younger
brother
and
from
that
time
forward
she
reigned
alone
calling
her
child
by
cæsar
her
colleague
on
the
throne
at
a
time
when
vice
and
luxury
claimed
the
thoughts
of
all
who
were
not
busy
in
the
civil
wars
we
can
not
hope
to
find
the
fruits
of
genius
in
alexandria
but
the
mathematics
are
plants
of
a
hardy
growth
and
are
not
choked
so
easily
as
poetry
and
history
sosigenes
was
then
the
first
astronomer
in
egypt
and
julius
cæsar
was
guided
by
his
advice
in
setting
right
the
roman
calendar
he
was
a
careful
and
painstaking
mathematician
and
after
fixing
the
length
of
the
year
at
three
hundred
and
days
and
a
quarter
he
three
times
changed
the
beginning
of
the
year
in
his
doubts
as
to
the
day
on
which
the
equinox
fell
for
the
astronomer
could
then
only
make
two
observations
in
a
year
with
a
view
to
learn
the
time
of
the
equinox
by
seeing
when
the
sun
shone
in
the
plane
of
the
equator
photinus
the
mathematician
wrote
both
on
arithmetic
and
geometry
and
was
usually
thought
the
author
of
a
mathematical
work
published
in
the
name
of
the
queen
called
the
canon
of
cleopatra
didymus
was
another
of
the
writers
that
we
hear
of
at
that
time
he
was
a
man
of
great
industry
both
in
reading
and
writing
but
when
we
are
told
that
he
wrote
three
thousand
five
hundred
volumes
or
rolls
it
rather
teaches
us
that
a
great
many
rolls
of
papyrus
would
be
wanted
to
make
a
modern
book
than
what
number
of
books
he
wrote
these
writings
were
mostly
on
verbal
criticism
and
all
have
long
since
perished
except
some
notes
or
scholia
on
the
hiad
and
odyssey
which
bear
his
name
and
are
still
printed

editions

of

left
a
work
on
herbs
and

and
on
their
uses
in
medicine
also
on
poisons
and
poisonous
bites
to
these
he
has
added
a
list
of
prescriptions
his
works
have
been
much
read
in
all
ages
and
have
only
been
set
aside
by
the
discoveries
of
the
last
few
centuries

of
hermonthis
he
followed
medicine
rather
than
surgery
and
while
trusting
chiefly
to
his
experience
gained
in
clinical
or
bedside
practice
was
laughed
at
by
the
surgeons
as
an
empiric
the
small
temple
at
hermonthis
near
thebes
seems
to
have
been
built
in
this
reign
and
it
is
dedicated
to
mandoo
or
the
sun
in
the
name
of
cleopatra
and
cassation
it
is
unlike
the
older
egyptian
temples
in
being
much
less
of
a
fortress
for
what
in
them
is
a
strongly
walled
courtyard

narrow
doorway

here

small
space
between

double
rows

roofed
building
is
the
same
as
in
the
older
temples
near
it
is

small
pool
seventy
feet
square
with
stone
sides
which
was
used
in
the
funerals
and

rites
the
murder
of

did
not
raise
the
character
of

make
them
more
fit
for
it

followed
by
the
civil
war
and
when
by
the
battle
of
philippi
and
the
death
of
brutus
and

his
party
was
again
uppermost
the
romans
willingly
bowed
their
necks
to
his

it
is
not
easy
to
determine
which
side
cleopatra
meant
to
take
in
the
war
between
antony
and
the
murderers
of
cæsar
she
did
not
openly
declare
herself
and
she
probably
waited
to
join
that

been
sent
to
her
by
dolobella
to
ask
for
such
troops
as
she
could
spare
to
help
antony
and
he
led
a
little
army
of
four
roman
legions
out
of
egypt
into
syria
but
when
there
he
added
them
to
the
force
which
cassius
had
assembled
against
antony
whether
he
acted
through
treachery
to
the
queen
or
by
her
orders
is
doubtful
for
cassius
felt
more
gratitude
to
allienus
than
to
cleopatra
serapion
also
the
egyptian
governor
of
cyprus
joined
what
was
then
the
stronger
side
and
sent
all
the
ships
that
he
had
in
his
ports
to
the
assistance
of
cassius
cleopatra
herself
was
getting
ready
another
large
fleet
but
since
the
war
was
over
and
brutus
and
cassius
dead
before
it
sailed
she
said
it
was
meant
to
help
octavianus
and
antony
thus
by
the
acts
of
her
generals
and
her
own
hesitation
cleopatra
fairly
laid
herself
open
to
the
reproach
of
ingratitude
to
her
late
friend
cæsar
or
at
least
of
thinking
that
the
interests
of
his
son
cæsarion
were
opposed
to
those
of
his
nephew
octavianus
and
accordingly
as
antony
was
passing
through
cilicia
with
his
army
he
sent
orders
to
her
to
come
from
egypt
and
meet
him
at
tarsus
to
answer
the
charge
of
having
helped
brutus
and
cassius
in
the
late
military
campaign
dellius
the
bearer
of
the
message
showed
that
he
understood
the
meaning
of
it
by
beginning
himself
to
pay
court
to
her
as
his
queen
he
advised
her
to
go
like
juno
in
the
iliad
in
her
best
attire
and
told
her
that
she
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
kind
and
gallant
antony
on
this
she
sailed
for
cilicia
laden
with
money
and
treasures
for
presents
full
of
trust
in
her
beauty
and
power
of
pleasing
she
had
won
the
heart
of
cæsar
when
though
younger
she
was
less
skilled
in
the
arts
of
love
and
she
was
still
only
years
old
and
carrying
with
her
such
gifts
and
treasures
as
became
her
rank
she
entered
the
river
cydnus
with
the
egyptian
fleet
in
a
magnificent
galley
the
stern
was
covered
with
gold
the
sails
were
of
scarlet
cloth
and
the
silver
oars
beat
time
to
the
music
of
flutes
and
harps
the
queen
dressed
like
venus
lay
under
an
awning
embroidered
with
gold
while
pretty
dimpled
boys
like
cupids
stood
on
each
side
of
the
sofa
fanning
her
her
maidens
dressed
like
and
graces
handled
the
silken
tackle
and
steered
the
vessel
as
she
approached
the
town
of
tarsus
the
winds
wafted
the
perfumes
and
the
scent
of
the
burning
incense
to
the
shores
which
were
lined
with
crowds
who
had
come
out
to
see
her
land
and
antony
who
was
seated
on
the
tribunal
waiting
to
receive
her
found
himself
left
alone
tarsus
on
the
river
cydnus
was
situated
at
the
foot
of
the
wooded
slopes
of
mount
taurus
and
it
guarded
the
great
pass
in
that
range
between
the
phrygian
tribes
and
the
phoenician
tribes
it
was
a
city
and
and
had
from
the
earliest
days
been
famed
for
and
commerce
mount
taurus
supplied
it
with
timber
and
around
the
mouth
of
its
river
as
it
widens
into
a
quiet
lake
were
the
ancient
dockyards
which
had
made
the
ships
of
tarshish
proverbial
with
the
hebrew
writers
its
merchants
enriched
by
industry
and
enlightened
by
foreign
trade
had
ornamented
their
city
with
public
buildings
and
established
a
school
of
greek
learning
its
philosophers
however
were
more
known
as
travelling
teachers
than
as
scholars
no
learned
men
came
to
tarsus
but
it
sent
forth
its
rhetoricians
in
its
own
ships
who
spread
themselves
as
teachers
over
the
neighbouring
coasts
in
rome
there
were
more
professors
of
rhetoric
oratory
and
poetry
from
tarsus
than
from
alexandria
or
athens
athenodorus
cordylion
the

taught

the
son
of

taught
cæsar

a
little
later

young
marcellus
while
demetrius
was
one
of
the
first
men
of
learning
who
sailed
to
the
distant
island
of
britain
this
school
in
the
next
generation
sent
forth
the
apostle
paul
who
taught
christianity
throughout
the
same
coasts
tarsus
was
now
to
be
amused
by
the
costly
follies
and
extravagances
of
cleopatra
as
an
initial
display
soon
after
landing
she
invited
antony
and
his
generals
to
a
dinner
at
which
the
whole
of
the
dishes
placed
before
them
were
of
gold
set
with
precious
stones
and
the
room
and
the
twelve
couches
were
ornamented
with
purple
and
gold
on
his
praising
the
splendour
of
the
sight
as
passing
anything
he
had
before
seen
she
said
it
was
a
trifle
and
begged
that
he
would
take
the
whole
of
it
as
a
gift
from
her
the
next
day
he
again
dined
with
her
and
brought
a
larger
number
of
his
friends
and
generals
and
was
of
course
startled
to
see
a
costliness
which
made
that
of
the
day
before
seem
nothing
and
she
again
gave
him
the
whole
of
the
gold
upon
the
table
and
gave
to
each
of
his
friends
the
couch
upon
which
he
sat
these
costly
and
delicate
dinners
were
continued
every
day
and
one
evening
when
antony
playfully
blamed
her
wastefulness
and
said
that
it
was
not
possible
to
fare
in
a
more
costly
manner
she
told
him
that
the
dinner
of
the
next
day
should
cost
ten
thousand
or
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
this
he
would
not
believe
and
laid
her
a
wager
that
she
would
fail
in
her
promise
when
the
day
came
the
dinner
was
as
grand
and
dainty
as
those
of
the
former
days
but
when
antony
called
upon
her
to
count
up
the
cost
of
the
meats
and
wines
she
said
that
she
did
not
reckon
them
but
that
she
should
herself
soon
eat
and
drink
the
ten
thousand
sestertia
she
wore
in
her
ears
two
pearls
the
largest
known
in
the
world
which
like
the
diamonds
of
european
kings
had
come
to
her
with
her
crown
and
kingdom
and
were
together
valued
at
that
large
sum
illustration
egyptian
picture
of
cleopatra
on
the
servants
removing
the
meats
they
set
before
her
a
glass
of
vinegar
and
she
took
one
of
these
earrings
from
her
ear
and
dropped
it
into
the
glass
and
when
dissolved
drank
it
off
plancus
one
of
the
guests
who
had
been
made
judge
of
the
wager
snatched
the
other
from
the
ear
and
saved
it
from
being
drunk
up
like
the
first
and
then
declared
that
antony
had
lost
his
bet
the
pearl
which
was
saved
was
afterwards
cut
in
two
and
made
into
a
pair
of
earrings
for
the
statue
of
venus
in
the
pantheon
at
rome
and
the
fame
of
the
wager
may
be
said
to
have
made
the
two
half
pearls
at
least
as
valuable
as
the
two
whole
ones

beauty
sweetness
and
gaiety
of
this
young
queen

to
her
great
powers
of
mind
which
were
all
turned
to
the
art
of
pleasing
had
quite
overcome
antony
he
had
sent
for
her
as
her
master
but
he
was
now
her
slave
her
playful
wit
was
delightful
her
voice
was
as
an
instrument
of
many
strings
she
spoke
readily
to
every
ambassador
in
his
own
language
and
was
said
to
be
the
only
sovereign
of
egypt
who
could
understand
the
languages
of
all
her
subjects
greek
egyptian
ethiopie
troglodytic
hebrew
arabic
and
syriac
with
these
charms
at
the
age
of
the
luxurious
antony
could
deny
her
nothing
the
first
favour
which
she
asked
of
her
lover
equals
any
cruelty
that
we
have
met
with
in
this
history
it
was
that
he
would
have
her
sister
arsinoë
put
to
death
cæsar
had
spared
her
life
after
his
triumph
through
love
of
cleopatra
but
he
was
mistaken
in
the
heart
of
his
mistress
she
would
have
been
then
better
pleased
at
death
and
antony
at
her
bidding
had
her
murdered
in
the
temple
of
diana
at
ephesus
though
fulvia
the
faithful
wife
of
antony
could
scarcely
keep
together
his
party
at
rome
against
the
power
of
octavianus
his
colleague
in
the
triumvirate
and
though
labienus
with
the
parthian
legions
was
ready
to
march
into
syria
against
him
yet
he
was
so
entangled
in
the
artful
nets
of
cleopatra
that
she
led
him
captive
to
alexandria
and
there
the
old
warrior
fell
into
every
idle
amusement
and
offered
up
at
the
shrine
of
pleasure
one
of
the
greatest
of
sacrifices
the
sacrifice
of
his
time
the
lovers
visited
each
other
every
day
and
the
waste
of
their
entertainments
passed
belief
philotas
a
physician
who
was
following
his
studies
at
alexandria
told
grandfather
that
he
was
once
invited
to
see
dinner
cooked
and
among
other
meats
were
eight
wild
boars
roasting
whole
and
the
cook
explained
to
him
that
though
there
were
only
twelve
guests
yet
as
each
dish
had
to
be
roasted
to
a
single
turn
of
the
spit
and
antony
did
not
know
at
what
hour
he
should
dine
it
was
necessary
to
cook
at
least
eight
dinners
but
the
most
costly
of
the
luxuries
then
used
in
egypt
were
the
scents
and
the
ointments
gold
silver
and
jewels
as
pliny
remarks
will
pass
to
a
heirs
even
clothes
will
last
a
few
months
or
weeks
but
scents
fly
off
and
are
lost
at
the
first
moment
that
they
are
admired
and
yet
ointments
like
the
attar
of
roses
which
melted
and
gave
out
their
scent
and
passed
into
air
when
placed
upon
the
back
of
the
hand
as
the
coolest
part
of
the
body
were
sold
for
four
hundred
denarii
the
pound
but
the
ointment
was
not
meant
to
be
used
quite
so
wastefully
it
was
usually
sealed
up
in
small
alabaster
jars
which
were
made
in
the
town
of
alabastron
on
the
east
of
the
nile
and
thence
received
their
name
these
were
long
in
shape
without
a
foot
and
had
a
narrow
mouth
they
were
meant
never
to
be
opened
but
to
let
the
scent
escape
slowly
and
sparingly
through
the
porous
stone
in
these
egyptian
jars
scented
ointment
was
carried
by
trade
to
the
banks
of
the
tigris
and
to
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
the
tenth
and
eleventh
years
of
the
reign
were
marked
by
a
famine
through
the
land
caused
by
the
not
rising
to
the
height
and
by
the
want
of
the
usual
overflow
and
an
inscription
which
was
written
both
in
the
greek
and
egyptian
languages
declares
the
gratitude
of
the
theban
priests
and
elders
and
citizens
to
callimachus
the
prefect
of
the
theban
taxes
who
did
what
he
could
to
lessen
the
sufferings
in
that
city
the
citizens
of
alexandria
on
those
years
received
from
the
government
a
smaller
gift
of
corn
than
usual
and
the
jews
then
felt
their
altered
rank
in
the
state
they
were
told
that
they
were
not
citizens
and
accordingly
received
no
portion
whatever
out
of
the
public
granaries
but
were
left
like
the
egyptians
to
take
care
of
themselves
from
this
time
forward
there
was
an
unceasing
quarrel
between
greeks
and
jews
in
the
city
of
alexandria
cleopatra
who
held
her
power
at
the
pleasure
of
the
roman
legions
spared
no
pains
to
please
antony
she
had
borne
him
first
a
son
named
ptolemy
and
then
a
son
and
daughter
twins
alexander
helius
and
cleopatra
selene
or
and
she
gamed
she
drank
she
hunted
she
reviewed
the
troops
with
him
and
to
humour
his
coarser
tastes
she
followed
him
in
his
midnight
rambles
through
the
city
in
the
dress
of
a
servant
and
nothing
that
youth
beauty
wealth
and
elegance
could
do
to
throw
a
cloak
over
the
grossness
of
vice
and
crime
was
forgotten
by
her
the
biographer
thought
it
waste
of
time
to
mention
all
arts
and
follies
but
the
story
of
his
fishing
was
not
to
be
forgotten
one
day
when
sitting
in
the
boat
with
her
he
caught
but
little
and
was
vexed
at
her
seeing
his
want
of
success
so
he
ordered
one
of
his
men
to
dive
into
the
water
and
put
upon
his
hook
a
fish
which
had
been
before
taken
cleopatra
however
saw
what
was
being
done
and
quietly
took
the
hint
for
a
joke
of
her
own
the
next
day
she
brought
a
larger
number
of
friends
to
see
the
fishing
and
when
antony
let
down
his
line
she
ordered
one
of
her
divers
to
put
on
the
hook
a
salted
fish
the
line
was
then
drawn
up
and
the
fish
landed
amid
no
little
mirth
of
their
friends
and
cleopatra
playfully
consoled
him
saying
general
you
may
leave
fishing
to
us
petty
princes
of
pharos
and
canopus
your
game
is
cities
provinces
and
eldest
son
by
fulvia
came
to
alexandria
at
this
time
and
lived
in
the
same
princely
style
with
his
father
philotas
the
physician
lived
in
his
service
and
one
day
at
supper
when
philotas
silenced
a
tiresome
talker
with
a
foolish
sophism
the
young
antony
gave
him
as
a
reward
the
whole
sideboard
of
plate
but
in
the
middle
of
this
gaiety
and
feasting
antony
was
recalled
to
europe
by
letters
which
told
him
that
his
wife
and
brother
had
been
driven
out
of
rome
by
octavianus
before
however
he
reached
rome
his
wife
fulvia
was
dead
and
wishing
to
strengthen
his
party
he
at
once
married
octavia
the
sister
of
octavianus
and
widow
of
marcellus
in
that
year
herod
passed
through
egypt
on
his
way
to
rome
to
claim
judæa
as
his
kingdom
he
came
through
arabia
to
pelusium
and
thence
he
sailed
to
alexandria
cleopatra
who
wanted
his
services
gave
him
honourable
entertainment
in
her
capital
and
made
him
great
offers
in
order
to
persuade
him
to
take
the
command
of
her
army
but
the
jewish
prince
saw
that
a
kingdom
was
to
be
gained
by
offering
his
services
to
antony
and
octavianus
and
he
went
on
to
rome
there
through
the
friendship
of
antony
he
was
declared
king
of
judæa
by
the
senate
he
then
returned
to
syria
to
collect
an
army
and
to
win
the
kingdom
which
had
been
granted
to
him
and
by
the
help
of
sosius
lieutenant
he
had
conquered
jerusalem
when
the
war
broke
out
between
antony
and
octavianus
in
the
next
year
antony
was
himself
in
syria
carrying
on
the
war
which
ended
with
the
battle
of
actium
and
he
sent
to
alexandria
to
beg
cleopatra
to
join
him
there
on
her
coming
he
made
her
perhaps
the
largest
gift
which
lover
ever
gave
to
his
mistress
he
gave
her
the
wide
provinces
of
phoenicia
cyprus
part
of
cilicia
part
of
judæa
and
part
of
arabia
nabataea
these
large
gifts
only
made
her
ask
for
more
and
she
begged
him
to
put
to
death
herod
king
of
judæa
and
malichus
king
of
arabia
nabataea
the
former
of
whom
had
advised
antony
to
break
through
the
disgraceful
ties
which
bound
him
to
cleopatra
as
the
only
means
of
saving
himself
from
being
crushed
by
the
rising
power
of
octavianus
she
asked
to
have
the
whole
of
arabia
and
judæa
given
to
her
but
antony
had
not
so
far
forgotten
himself
as
to
yield
to
these
commands
and
he
only
gave
her
the
balsam
country
around
jericho
and
a
of
two
hundred
talents
or
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
a
year
on
the
revenues
of
judæa
on
receiving
this
large
addition
to
her
kingdom
and
perhaps
in
honour
of
antony
who
had
then
lost
all
power
in
italy
but
was
the
real
king
of
egypt
and
its
greek
provinces
cleopatra
began
to
count
the
years
of
her
reign
afresh
what
was
really
the
sixteenth
of
her
reign
and
had
been
called
the
sixteenth
of
ptolemy
her
elder
brother
she
called
the
first
of
her
own
reign
and
she
reckoned
them
in
the
same
way
till
her
death
cleopatra
had
accompanied
antony
on
his
expedition
against
armenia
as
far
as
the
river
euphrates
and
returned
through
damascus
to
judæa
there
she
was
politely
received
by
her
enemy
herod
who
was
too
much
in
fear
of
antony
to
take
his
revenge
on
her
she
farmed
out
to
him
the
revenues
of
her
parts
of
arabia
and
judæa
and
was
accompanied
by
him
on
her
way
towards
egypt
but
after
wondering
at
the
wasteful
feasts
and
gifts
in
which
pearls
and
provinces
were
alike
trifled
with
we
are
reminded
that
even
cleopatra
was
of
the
family
of
the
lagido
and
that
she
was
well
aware
how
much
the
library
of
the
museum
had
added
to
the
glory
of
alexandria
it
had
been
burnt
by
the
roman
troops
under
cæsar
and
to
make
amends
for
this
antony
gave
her
the
large
library
of
the
city
of
pergamus
by
which
eumenes
and
attalus
had
hoped
to
raise
a
school
that
should
equal
the
museum
of
alexandria
cleopatra
placed
these
two
hundred
thousand
volumes
in
the
temple
of
serapis
and
alexandria
again
held
the
largest
library
in
the
world
while
pergamus
ceased
to
be
a
place
of
learning
by
the
help
of
this
new
library
the
city
still
kept
its
trade
in
books
and
its
high
rank
as
a
school
of
letters
and
when
the
once
proud
kingdom
of
egypt
was
a
province
of
rome
and
when
almost
every
trace
of
the
monarchy
was
lost
and
half
a
century
afterwards
philo
the
jewish
philosopher
of
alexandria
asked
are
now
the
ptolemies
the
historian
could
have
found
an
answer
by
pointing
to
the
mathematical
schools
and
the
library
of
the
serapeum
but
to
return
to
our
history
when
antony
left
cleopatra
he
marched
against
the
parthians
and
on
his
return
he
again
entered
alexandria
in
triumph
leading
artavasdes
king
of
armenia
chained
behind
his
chariot
as
he
rode
in
procession
through
the
city
he
soon
afterwards
made
known
his
plans
for
the
government
of
egypt
and
the
provinces
he
called
together
the
alexandrians
in
the
gymnasium
and
seating
himself
and
cleopatra
on
two
golden
thrones
he
declared
her
son
cæsarion
her
colleague
and
that
they
should
hold
egypt
cyprus
africa
and
to
her
sons
by
himself
he
gave
the
title
of
kings
the
children
of
kings
and
to
alexander
though
still
a
child
he
gave
armenia
and
media
with
parthia
when
it
should
be
conquered
and
to
ptolemy
he
gave
phoenicia
syria
and
cilicia
cleopatra
wore
the
sacred
robe
of
isis
and
took
the
title
of
the
new
isis
while
the
young
alexander
wore
a
median
dress
with
turban
and
tiara
and
the
little
ptolemy
a
long
cloak
and
slippers
with
a
bonnet
encircled
by
a
diadem

the
successors
of
alexander
antony
himself
wore
an
eastern
scimetar
by
his
side
and
a
royal
diadem
round
ins
head
as
being
not
less
a
sovereign
than
cleopatra
to
cleopatra
he
then
gave
the
whole
of
his
parthian
booty
and
his
prisoner

illustration
coin

cleopatra
and
anthony
but
notwithstanding
love
for
cleopatra
her
falsehood
and
cruelty
were
such
that
when
his
power
in
rome
fell
he
could
no
longer
trust
her
he
even
feared
that
she
might
have
him
poisoned
and
would
not
eat
or
drink
in
her
palace
without
having
the
food
first
tasted
herself
but
she
had
no
such
thoughts
and
only
laughed
at
him
for
his
distrust
one
day
to
prove
her
power
and
at
the
same
time
her
good
faith
she
had
the
flowers
with
which
he
was
to
be
crowned
as
he
reclined
at
her

in
deadly
poison
antony
dined
with
these

his
head
while
she
wore
a
crown
of
fresh
flowers
during
the
dinner
cleopatra
playfully
took
off
her
garland
and
dipped
it
in
her
cup
to
flavour
the
wine
and
antony
did
the
same
with
his
poisoned
flowers
steeping
them
in
his
own
cup
of
wine
he
even
raised
it
to
his
lips
to
drink
when
she
hastily
caught
hold
of
his
hand
said
she
am
the
enemy
against
whom
you
have
latterly
been
so
careful
if
i
could
have
endured
to
live
without
you

draught
would
have
given
me

then
ordered
the
wine
to
be
taken
to
one
of
the
condemned
criminals
and
sent
antony
out
to
see
that
the
man
died
on
drinking
it
on
the
early
coins
of
cleopatra
we
see
her
head
on
the
one
side
and

eagle

the
other
side

with
hers
as
king
and

he
is
styled
and
she
young
cleopatra
was
perhaps
the
last
greek
sovereign
that
bore
the
title
of
god
nor
did
it
seem
unsuitable
to
her
so
common
had
the
greeks
of
asia
and
egypt
made
that
epithet
by
giving
it
to
their
kings
and
even
to
their
families
and
favourites
but
the
use
of
the
word
made
no
change
in
their
religious
opinions
they
never
for
a
moment
supposed
that
the
persons
whom
they
so
styled
had
any
share
in
the
creation
and
government
of
the

had
left
antony
with
the
chief
sway
in
the
roman
world
but
his
life
of
pleasure
in
egypt
had
done
much
to
forfeit
it
and
octavianus
afterwards
called
augustus
had
been
for
some
time
rising
in
power
against
him
his
party
however
was
still
strong
enough
in
rome
to
choose
for
consul
his
friend
soslus
who
put
the
head
of
antony
on
one
side
of
his
coins

the
egyptian

and

on

afterwards
antony
was
himself
chosen
as

for
the
coming
year
and
he
then
struck

side
the

entering
on

office
he
was

octavianus
however
would
not
declare
war
against
him
but
declared
war
against

rather
as
he
said
against

held

was

octavianus
held
rome
with
its
western
provinces
and
hardy
legions
while
antony
held
the
greek
kingdom
of
ptolemy
cleopatra
was
confident
of
success
and
as
boastful
as
she
was
confident
her
most
solemn
manner
of
promising
was
surely
as
i
shall
issue
my
decrees
from
the
roman
but
the
mind
of
antony
was
ruined
by
his
life
of
pleasure
he
carried
her
with
him
into
battle
at
once
his
strength
and
his
weakness
and
he
was
beaten
at
sea
by
octavianus
on
the
coast
of
epirus
near
actium
this
battle
which
sealed
the
fate
of
antony
of
egypt
and
of
rome
would
never
have
been
spoken
of
in
history
if
he
had
then
had
the
courage
to
join
his
land
forces
but
he
sailed
away
in
a
fright
with
cleopatra
leaving
an
army
larger
than
that
of
octavianus
which
would
not
believe
that
he
was
gone
they
landed
at
parastonium
in
libya
where
he
remained
in
the
desert
with
aristocrates
the
rhetorician
and
one
or
two
other
friends
and
sent
cleopatra
forward
to
alexandria
there
she
talked
of
carrying
her
ships
across
the
isthmus
to
the
head
of
the
red
sea
along
the
canal
from
bubastis
to
the
bitter
lakes
and
thence
flying
to
some
unknown
land
from
the
power
of
the
conqueror
antony
soon
however
followed
her
but
not
to
join
in
society
he
locked
himself
up
in
his
despair
in
a
small
fortress
by
the
side
of
the
harbour
which
he
named
his
timonium
after
timon
the
athenian
philosopher
who
forsook
the
society
of
men
when
the
news
however
arrived
that
his
land
forces
had
joined
octavianus
and
his
allies
had
deserted
him
he
came
out
of
his
timonium
and
joined
the
queen
in
alexandria
antony
and
cleopatra
only
so
far
regained
their
courage
as
to
forget
their
losses
and
to
plunge
into
the
same
round
of
costly
feasts
and
shows
that
they
had
amused
themselves
with
before
their
fall
but
while
they
were
wasting
these
few
weeks
in
pleasure
octavianus
was
moving
his
fleet
and
army
upon
egypt
when
he
landed
on
the
coast
egypt
held
three
millions
of
people
he
might
have
been
met
by
three
hundred
thousand
men
able
to
bear
arms

for
money
which
has
sometimes
been
called
the
sinews
of
war
though
there
might
have
been
none
in
the
treasury
yet
it
could
not
have
been
wanting
in
alexandria
but
the
egyptians
like
the
ass
in
the
fable
had
nothing
to
fear
from
a
change
of
masters
they
could
hardly
be
kicked
and
cuffed
worse
than
they
had
been
and
though
they
themselves
were
the
prize
struggled
for
they
looked
on
with
the
idle
stare
of
a
bystander
some
few
of
the
garrisons
made
a
show
of
holding
out
but
as
antony
had
left
the
whole
of
his
army
in
greece
when
he
fled
away
after
the
battle
of
actium
he
had
lost
all
chance
of
safety
when
pelusium
was
taken
it
was
said
by
some
that
seleucus
the
commander
had
given
it
up
by
orders
but
the
queen
to
justify
herself
put
the
wife
and
children
of
seleucus
into
the
hands
of
antony
to
be
punished
if
he
thought
fit
when
octavianus
arrived
in
front
of
alexandria
he
encamped
not
far
from
the
hippodrome
a
few
miles
from
the
canopic
or
eastern
gate
on
this

made
a
brisk
sally
and
routing
the
roman
cavalry
returned
to
the
city
in
triumph
on
his
way
to
the
palace
he
met
cleopatra
whom
he
kissed
armed
as
he
was
and
recommended
to
her
favour
a
brave
soldier
who
had
done
good
service
in
the
battle
she
gave
the
man
a
cuirass
and
helmet
of
gold
but
he
saw
that
cause
was
ruined
his
treasure
made
him
selfish
and
he
went
over
to
the
camp
that
very
night
the
next
morning
antony
ordered
out
his
forces
both
on
land
and
sea
to
engage
with
those
of
octavianus
but
he
was
betrayed
by
his
generals
his
fleet
and
cavalry
deserted
him
without
a
blow
being
struck
and
his
infantry
easily
routed
retreated
into
the
city
illustration
greek
picture
of

cleopatra
had
never
acted
justly
towards
her
jewish
subjects
and
during
a
late
famine
had
denied
to
them
their
share
of
the
wheat
distributed
out
of
the
public
granaries
to
the
citizens
of
alexandria
the
jews
in
return
showed
no
loyalty
to
cleopatra
nor
regret
at
her
success
and
on
this
defeat
of
her
troops
her
rage
fell
upon
them
she
made
a
boast
of
her
cruelty
towards
them
and
thought
if
she
could
have
killed
all
the
jews
with
her
own
hand
she
should
have
been
repaid
for
the
loss
of
the
city
on
the
other
hand
antony
thought
that
he
had
been
betrayed
by
cleopatra
as
she
had
received
many
messengers
from
octavianus
to
avoid
his
anger
therefore
she
fled
to
a
monument
which
she
had
built
near
the
temple
of
isis
and
in
which
she
had
before
placed
her
treasure

gold

and
cinnamon
together
with
a
large
quantity
of
flax
and
a
number
of
torches
as
though
to
burn
herself
and
her
wealth
in
one
flame
here
she
retired
with
two
of
her
women
and
secured
herself
with
bars
and
bolts
and
sent
word
to
antony
that
she
was
dead

he
heard
it
believing
that
she
had
killed
herself
and
wishing
not
to
be
outdone
in
courage
by
a
woman
plunged
his
sword
into
his
breast
but
the
wound
was
not
fatal
and
when
cleopatra
heard
of
it
she
sent
to
beg
that
he
would
come
to
her
accordingly
his
servants
carried
him
to
the
door
of
her
monument
but
the
queen
in
fear
of
treachery
would
not
suffer
the
door
to
be
opened
but
she
let
a
cord
down
from
the
window
and
she
with
her
two
women
drew
him
up

could
be
more
affecting
than
the
sight
to
all
who
were
near
antony
covered
with
blood
in
the
agonies
of
death
stretching
out
his
hands
to
cleopatra

she
straining
every
nerve
and
every
feature
of
her
face
with
the
effort
she
was
making
he
was
at
last
lifted
in
at
the
window
but
died
soon
afterwards
by
this
time

city
was
in
the
power
of
octavianus

had
not
found
it
necessary
to
storm
the
walls

troops
had
all
joined
him
and
he
sent
in
gallus
to
endeavour
to
take
cleopatra
alive

he
succeeded
in
doing
by
drawing
her
into
conversation
at
the
door
of
her
monument

men
scaled
the
window
and
snatched
out
of
her
hand

which
she
would
have
stabbed

promising
his
soldiers
two
hundred
and
fifty
drachmas
each
as

at

on

leaning
on
the

of

as
he
wished
to
be
thought
as
great
a
lover
of
learning
as
of
mercy
he
gave
out
that
he
spared
the
place
to
the
prayers
of
his
alexandrian
friend
he
called
the
greek
citizens
together
in
the
gymnasium
and
mounting
the
tribunal
promised
that
they
should
not
be

while
flying
towards

put
to
death

flatterers
of

of
course
say
that

was
not

of
ptolemy
the
elder
of
the
two
boys
who
had
been
called
husbands
the
feelings

might
have
answered
that
if
he
was
not
the
only
son
of
the
uncle
to
whom
octavianus
owed
everything
he
was
at
least
helpless
and
friendless
and
that
he
never
could
trouble
the
undisputed
master
of
the
world
but
augustus
with
the
heartless
cruelty
which
murdered
cicero
and
the
cold
caution
which
marked
his
character
through
life
listening
to
the
remark
of
arius
that
there
ought
not
to
be
two
cæsars
had
him
at
once
put
to
death
augustus
gave
orders
that
cleopatra
should
be
carefully
guarded
lest
she
should
put
an
end
to
her
own
life
he
wished
to
carry
her
with
him
to
rome
as
the
ornament
of
his
triumph
he
paid
her
a
visit
of
condolence
and
consolation
he
promised
her
she
should
receive
honourable
treatment
he
allowed
her
to
bury
antony
he
threatened
that
her
children
should
be
punished
if
she
hurt
herself
but
she
deceived
her
guards
and
put
herself
to
death
either
by
poison
or
as
was
more
commonly
thought
by
the
bite
of
an
asp
brought
to
her
in
a
basket
of
fruit
she
was
years
of
age
having
reigned
years
of
which
the
last
seven
were
in
conjunction
with
antony
and
she
was
buried
in
his
tomb
with
all
regal
splendour
the
death
of
cleopatra
was
hailed
at
rome
as
a
relief
from
a
sad
disgrace
by
others
besides
the
flatterers
of
the
conqueror
when
governed
by
julius
cæsar
and
afterwards
by
antony
the
romans
sometimes
fancied
they
were
receiving
orders
from
the
barbarian
queen
to
whom
their
master
was
a
slave
when
antony
was
in
arms
against
his
countrymen
they
were
not
without
alarm
at
boast
that
she
would
yet
make
her
power
felt
in
the
capitol
and
many
feared
that
even
when
antony
was
overthrown
the
conqueror
might
himself
be
willing
to
wear
her
chains
but
the
prudent
augustus
was
in
no
danger
of
being
dazzled
by
beauty
he
saw
clearly
all
that
was
within
his
reach
he
did
not
want
her
help
to
the
sovereignty
of
egypt
and
from
the
day
that
he
entered
the
empty
palace
in
alexandria
his
reign
began
as
sole
master
of
rome
and
its
dependent
provinces
while
we
have
in
this
history
been
looking
at
the
romans
from
afar
and
only
seen
their
dealings
with
foreign
kings
we
have
been
able
to
note
some
of
the
changes
in
their
manners
nearly
as
well
as
if
we
had
stood
in
the
forum
when
epiphanes
philometor
and
euergetes
ii
owed
their
crowns
to
roman
help
rome
gained
nothing
but
thanks
and
that
weight
in
their
councils
which
is
fairly
due
to
usefulness
the
senate
asked
for
no
tribute
and
the
citizens
took
no
bribes
but
with
the
growth
of
power
came
the
love
of
conquest
and
of
its
spoils
macedonia
was
conquered
in
what
might
be
called
in
the
reign
of
cleopatra
cocce
cyrene
was
won
by
fraud
and
cyprus
was
then
seized
without
a
plea
the
senators
were
even
more
eager
for
bribes
than
the
senate
for
provinces
the
nobles
who
governed
these
wide
provinces
grew
too
powerful
for
the
senate
and
found
that
they
could
heap
up
wealth
faster
by
patronising
kings
than
by
conquering
them
and
the
egyptian
monarchy
was
left
to
stand
in
the
reigns
of
auletes
and
cleopatra
because
the
romans
were
still
more
greedy
than
when
they
seized
cyrene
and
cyprus
and
lastly
when
the
romans
were
worn
out
by
quarrels
and
the
want
of
a
steady
government
and
were
ready
to
obey
any
master
who
could
put
a
stop
to
civil
bloodshed
they
made
octavianus
autocrat
of
rome
he
then
gained
for
himself
whatever
he
seized
in
the
name
of
the
republic
and
he
at
once
put
an
end
to
the
egyptian
monarchy
thus
fell
the
family
of
the
ptolemies
a
family
that
had
perhaps
done
more
for
arts
and
letters
than
any
that
can
be
pointed
out
in
history
like
other
kings
who
have
bought
the
praises
of
poets
orators
and
historians
they
may
have
misled
the
talents
which
they
wished
to
guide
and
have
smothered
the
fire
which
they
seemed
to
foster
but
in
rewarding
the
industry
of
the
mathematicians
and
anatomists
of
the
critics
commentators
and
compilers
they
seem
to
have
been
highly
successful
it
is
true
that
alexandria
never
sent
forth
works
with
the
high
tone
of
philosophy
the
lofty
moral
aim
and
the
pure
taste
which
mark
the
writings
of
greece
in
its
best
ages
and
which
ennoble
the
mind
and
mend
the
heart
but
it
was
the
school
to
which
the
world
long
looked
for
knowledge
in
all
those
sciences
which
help
the
body
and
improve
the
arts
of
life
and
which
are
sometimes
called
useful
knowledge
though
great
and
good
actions
may
not
have
been
unknown
in
alexandria
so
few
valued
them
that
none
took
the
trouble
to
record
them
the
writers
never
wrote
the
lives
of
the
ptolemies
the
muse
of
history
had
no
seat
in
the
museum
but
it
was
almost
the
birthplace
of
anatomy
geometry
conic
sections
geography
astronomy
and
hydrostatics
illustration
grand
column
at
karnak
if
we
retrace
the
steps
by
which
this
monarchy
rose
and
fell
we
shall
see
that
virtue
and
vice
wisdom
and
folly
care
and
thoughtlessness
were
for
the
most
part
followed
by
the
rewards
which
to
us
seem
natural
the
egyptian
gold
which
first
tempted
the
greeks
into
the
country
and
then
helped
their
energies
to
raise
the
monarchy
afterwards
undermined
those
same
energies
and
became
one
of
the
principal
causes
of
its
final
overthrow
in
ptolemy
soter
we
see
plain
manners
careful
plans
untiring
activity
and
a
wise
choice
of
friends
by
him
talents
were
highly
paid
wherever
they
were
found
no
service
left
unrewarded
the
people
trusted
and
taught
the
use
of
arms
their
love
gained
by
wise
laws
and
justice
docks
harbours
and
fortresses
built
schools
opened
and
by
these
means
a
great
monarchy
founded
ptolemy
was
eager
to
fill
the
ranks
of
his
armies
with
soldiers
and
his
new
city
with
traders
instead
of
trying
to
govern
against
the
will
of
the
people
to
thwart
or
overlook
their
wishes
and
feelings
his
utmost
aim
was
to
guide
them
and
to
make
alexandria
a
more
agreeable
place
of
settlement
than
the
cities
of
asia
minor
and
syria
for
the
thousands
who
were
then
pouring
out
of
greece
on
the
check
given
to
its
trading
industry
by
the
overthrow
of
its
freedom
though
every
thinking
man
might
have
seen
that
the
new
government
when
it
gained
shape
and
strength
would
be
a
military
despotism
yet
his
greek
subjects
must
have
felt
while
it
was
weak
and
resting
on
their
rather
than
on
their
habits
that
they
were
enjoying
many
of
the
blessings
of
freedom
had
they
then
claimed
a
share
in
the
government
they
would
most
likely
have
gained
it
and
thereby
they
would
have
handed
down
those
blessings
to
their
children
before
the
death
of
ptolemy
soter
the
habits
of
the
people
had
so
closely
entwined
themselves
round
the
throne
that
philadelphus
was
able
to
take
the
kingdom
and
the
whole
of
its
wide
provinces
at
the
hands
of
his
father
as
a
family
estate
he
did
nothing
to
mar
his
wise
plans
which
then
ripened
into
trade
crowded
the
harbours
and
markets
learning
filled
the
schools
conquests
rewarded
the
discipline
of
the
fleets
and
armies
power
wealth
and
splendour
followed
in
due
order
the
blaze
thus
cast
around
the
throne
would
by
many
kings
have
been
made
to
stand
in
the
place
of
justice
and
mildness
but
under
philadelphus
it
only
threw
a
light
upon
his
good
government
he
was
acknowledged
both
at
home
and
abroad
to
be
the
first
king
of
his
age
greece
and
its
philosophers
looked
up
to
him
as
a
friend
and
patron
and
though
as
a
man
he
must
take
rank
far
below
his
father
by
whose
wisdom
the
eminence
on
which
he
stood
was
raised
yet
in
all
the
gold
and
glitter
of
a
king
philadelphus
was
the
greatest
of
his
family
the
egyptians
had
been
treated
with
kindness
by
both
of
these
greek
kings
as
far
as
they
had
been
able
or
willing
to
copy
the
arts
of
greece
they
had
been
raised
to
a
level
with
the
macedonians
the
egyptian
worship
and
temples
had
been
upheld
as
if
in
obedience
to
the
answer
of
the
delphic
oracle
that
the
gods
should
everywhere
be
worshipped
according
to
the
laws
of
the
country
but
euergetes
was
much
more
of
an
egyptian
and
while
he
was
bringing
back
the
ancient
splendour
to
the
temples
the
priests
must
have
regained
something
of
their
former
rank
but
they
had
no
hold
on
the
minds
of
the
soldiers
had
the
mercenaries
upon
whom
the
power
of
the
king
rested
been
worshippers
in
the
egyptian
temples
the
priests
might
as
in
the
earlier
times
like
a
body
of
nobles
have
checked
his
power
when
too
great
and
at
other
times
upheld
it
but
it
was
not
so
and
upon
the
whole
little
seems
to
have
been
gained
by
the
court
becoming
more
egyptian
while
the
army
must
have
lost
something
of
its
greek
discipline
and
plainness
of
manners
but
in
the
next
reign
the
fruits
of
this
change
were
seen
to
be
most
unfortunate
philopator
was
an
eastern
despot
surrounded
by
eunuchs
and
drowned
in
pleasures
the
country
was
governed
by
his
women
and
vicious
favourites
the
army
which
at
the
beginning
of
his
reign
amounted
to
thousand
men
beside
the
garrisons
was
at
first
weakened
by
rebellion
and
before
the
end
of
his
reign
it
fell
to
pieces
nothing
however
happened
to
prove
his
weakness
to
surrounding
nations
egypt
was
still
the
greatest
of
kingdoms
though
rome
on
the
conquest
of
carthage
and
syria
under
antiochus
the
great
were
fast
gaining
ground
upon
it
but
he
left
to
his
infant
son
a
throne
shaken
to
the
very
foundations
the
ministers
of
epiphanes
the
infant
autocrat
found
the
government
without
a
head
and
without
an
army
the
treasury
without
money
and
the
people
without
virtue
or
courage
and
they
placed
the
kingdom
under
the
hands
of
the
romans
to
save
it
from
being
shared
between
the
kings
of
syria
and
macedonia
thus
passed
the
first
five
reigns
the
first
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
the
first
half
of
the
three
centuries
that
the
kingdom
of
the
ptolemies
lasted
it
was
then
rotten
at
the
core
with
vice
and
luxury
its
population
was
lessening
its
trade
falling
off
its
treasury
empty
its
revenue
too
small
for
the
wasteful
expenses
of
the
government
but
nevertheless
in
the
eyes
of
surrounding
nations
its
trade
and
wealth
seemed
boundless
illustration
needle
taste
genius
and
poetry
had
passed
away
but
mathematics
surgery
and
grammar
still
graced
the
museum
the
decline
of
art
is
shown
upon
the
coins
and
even
in
the
shape
of
the
letters
upon
the
coins
on
those
of
cleopatra
the

the

the

is
formed
like
an

reversed
during
the
reigns
of
the
later
ptolemies
the
kingdom
was
under
the
shield
but
also
under
the
sceptre
of
rome
its
kings
sent
to
rome
for
help
sometimes
against
their
enemies
and
sometimes
against
their
subjects
sometimes
they
humbly
asked
the
senate
for
advice
and
at
other
times
were
able
respectfully
to
disobey
the
roman
orders
one
by
one
the
senate
seized
the
provinces
the
coast
of
asia
minor
cyrene
and
the
island
of
cyprus
and
lastly
though
the
ptolemies
still
reigned
they
were
counted
among
the
clients
of
the
roman
patrician
to
whom
they
looked
up
for
patronage
from
this
low
state
egypt
could
scarcely
be
said
to
fall
when
it
became
a
part
of
the
great
empire
of
augustus
during
the
reigns
of
the
ptolemies
the
sculpture
the
style
of
building
the
religion
the
writing
and
the
language
of
the
kopts
in
the
thebaid
were
nearly
the
same
as
when
their
own
kings
were
reigning
in
thebes
with
even
fewer
changes
than
usually
creep
in
through
time
they
had
all
become
less
simple
and
though
it
would
be
difficult
and
would
want
a
volume
by
itself
to
trace
these
changes
and
to
show
when
they
came
into
use
yet
a
few
of
them
may
be
pointed
out
the
change
of
fashion
must
needs
be
slower
in
buildings
which
are
only
raised
by
the
untiring
labour
of
years
and
which
when
built
stand
for
ages
but
in
the
later
temples
we
find
less
strength
as
fortresses
few
obelisks
or
sphinxes
and
no
colossal
statues
we
no
longer
meet
with
vast
caves
or
pyramids
the
columns
in
a
temple
have
several
new
patterns
the
capitals
which
used
to
be
copied
from
the
papyrus
plant
are
now
formed
of
lotus
flowers
or
palm
branches
in
some
cases
with
a
sad
want
of
taste
the
weight
of
the
roof
rests
on
the
weak
head
of
a
woman
the
buildings
however
of
the
ptolemies
are
such
that
before
the
hieroglyphics
on
them
had
been
read
by
doctor
young
nobody
had
ever
guessed
that
they
were
later
than
the
time
of
cambyses
while
three
or
four
pillars
at
alexandria
were
almost
the
only
proof
that
the
country
had
ever
been
held
by
greeks
in
the
religion
we
find
many
new
gods
or
old
gods
in
new

were
more
words
spelled

the

more
crowded

the
titles

the
kings
within

became
much
longer
with
the

becoming
common
about

it
was
called
coming
into
use
in
which
there
were
few
symbols
and
most
of
the
words
were
spelt
with
letters
each
letter
was
of
the
easy
sloping
form
which
came
from
its
being
made
with
a
reed
or
pen
instead
of
the
stiff
form
of
the
hieroglyphics
which
were
mostly
cut
in
stone
but
there
is
a
want
of
neatness
which
has
thrown
a
difficulty
over
them
and
has
made
these
writings
less
easy
to
read
than
the
hieroglyphics
when
the
country
fell
into
the
hands
of
augustus
the
kopts
were
in
a
much
lower
state

alexander

very
little

all
respect

those

they
degrade
themselves
