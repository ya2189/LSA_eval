preface
the
title
i
have
given
my
black
heroine
in
this
second
edition
of
her
story
viz
the
moses
of
her
people
may
seem
a
little
ambitious
considering
that
this
moses
was
a
woman
and
that
she
succeeded
in
piloting
only
three
or
four
hundred
slaves
from
the
land
of
bondage
to
the
land
of
freedom
but
i
only
give
her
here
the
name
by
which
she
was
familiarly
known
both
at
the
north
and
the
south
during
the
years
of
terror
of
the
fugitive
slave
law
and
during
our
last
civil
war
in
both
of
which
she
took
so
prominent
a
part
and
though
the
results
of
her
unexampled
heroism
were
not
to
free
a
whole
nation
of
and
yet
this
object
was
as
much
the
desire
of
her
heart
as
it
was
of
that
of
the
great
leader
of
israel
her
cry
to
the
was
ever
like
his
to
pharaoh
let
my
people
go
and
not
even
he
imperiled
life
and
limb
more
willingly
than
did
our
courageous
and
friend
her
name
deserves
to
be
handed
down
to
posterity
side
by
side
with
the
names
of
jeanne
grace
darling
and
florence
nightingale
for
not
one
of
these
women
noble
and
brave
as
they
were
has
shown
more
courage
and
power
of
endurance
in
facing
danger
and
death
to
relieve
human
suffering
than
this
poor
black
woman
whose
story
i
am
endeavoring
in
a
most
imperfect
way
to
give
you
would
that
stowe
had
carried
out
the
plan
she
once
projected
of
being
the
historian
of
our
sable
friend
by
her
graphic
pen
the
incidents
of
such
a
life
might
have
been
wrought
up
into
a
tale
of
thrilling
interest
equaling
if
not
exceeding
her
world
renowned
uncle
tom
cabin
the
work
fell
to
humbler
hands
and
the
first
edition
of
this
story
under
the
title
of
harriet
tubman
was
written
in
the
greatest
possible
haste
while
the
writer
was
preparing
for
a
voyage
to
europe
there
was
pressing
need
for
this
book
to
save
the
poor
woman
little
home
from
being
sold
under
a
mortgage
and
letters
and
facts
were
penned
down
rapidly
as
they
came
in
the
book
has
now
been
in
part
and
the
letters
and
testimonials
placed
in
an
appendix
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
incredulous
and
there
will
naturally
be
many
such
when
so
strange
a
tale
is
repeated
to
them
i
will
here
state
that
so
far
as
it
has
been
possible
i
have
received
corroboration
of
every
incident
related
to
me
by
my
heroic
friend
i
did
this
for
the
satisfaction
of
others
not
for
my
own
no
one
can
hear
harriet
talk
and
not
believe
every
word
she
says
as
sanborn
says
of
her
she
is
too
a
person
not
to
be
true
many
incidents
quite
as
wonderful
as
those
related
in
the
story
i
have
rejected
because
i
had
no
way
in
finding
the
persons
who
could
speak
to
their
truth
this
woman
was
the
friend
of
william
seward
of
gerritt
smith
of
wendell
phillips
of
william
lloyd
garrison
and
of
many
other
distinguished
philanthropists
before
the
war
as
of
very
many
officers
of
the
union
army
during
the
conflict
after
her
almost
superhuman
efforts
in
making
her
own
escape
from
slavery
and
then
returning
to
the
south
and
bringing
away
with
her
over
three
hundred
fugitives
she
was
sent
by
governor
andrew
of
massachusetts
to
the
south
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
to
act
as
spy
and
scout
for
our
armies
and
to
be
employed
as
hospital
nurse
when
needed
here
for
four
years
she
labored
without
any
remuneration
and
during
the
time
she
was
acting
as
nurse
never
drew
but
twenty
days
rations
from
our
government
she
managed
to
support
herself
as
well
as
to
take
care
of
the
suffering
soldiers
secretary
seward
exerted
himself
in
every
possible
way
to
procure
her
a
pension
from
congress
but
proved
too
strong
even
for
him
and
her
case
was
rejected
because
it
did
not
come
under
any
recognized
law
the
first
edition
of
this
little
story
was
published
through
the
liberality
of
gerritt
smith
wendell
phillips
and
prominent
men
in
auburn
and
the
object
for
which
it
was
written
was
accomplished
but
that
book
has
long
been
out
of
print
and
the
facts
stated
there
are
all
unknown
to
the
present
generation
there
have
i
am
told
often
been
calls
for
the
book
which
could
not
be
answered
and
i
have
been
urged
by
many
friends
as
well
as
by
harriet
herself
to
prepare
another
edition
for
another
necessity
has
arisen
and
she
needs
help
again
not
for
herself
but
for
certain
helpless
ones
of
her
people
her
own
sands
are
nearly
run
but
she
hopes
she
goes
home
to
see
this
work
a
hospital
well
under
way
her
last
breath
and
her
last
efforts
will
be
spent
in
the
cause
of
those
for
whom
she
has
already
risked
so
much
for
them
her
tears
will
fall
for
them
her
prayers
ascend
to
them
her
toils
and
cares
be
given
till
toils
and
cares
shall
end
letter
from
oliver
johnson
for
the
second
edition
new
york
my
dear
madam
i
am
very
glad
to
learn
that
you
are
about
to
publish
a
revised
edition
of
your
life
of
that
heroic
woman
harriet
tubman
by
whose
assistance
so
many
american
slaves
were
enabled
to
break
their
bonds
during
the
period
of
my
official
connection
with
the
office
in
new
york
i
saw
her
frequently
when
she
came
there
with
the
companies
of
slaves
whom
she
had
successfully
piloted
away
from
the
south
and
often
listened
with
wonder
to
the
story
of
her
adventures
and
escapes
she
always
told
her
tale
with
a
modesty
which
showed
how
unconscious
she
was
of
having
done
anything
more
than
her
simple
duty
no
one
who
listened
to
her
could
doubt
her
perfect
truthfulness
and
integrity
her
shrewdness
in
planning
the
escape
of
slaves
her
skill
in
avoiding
arrest
her
courage
in
every
emergency
and
her
willingness
to
endure
hardship
and
face
any
danger
for
the
sake
of
her
poor
followers
was
phenomenal
i
regret
to
hear
that
she
is
poor
and
ill
and
hope
the
sale
of
your
book
will
give
her
the
relief
she
so
much
needs
and
so
well
deserves
yours
truly
oliver
johnson
auburn
theol
seminary
by
professor
hopkins
the
remarkable
person
who
is
the
subject
of
the
following
sketch
has
been
residing
mostly
ever
since
the
close
of
the
war
in
the
outskirts
of
the
city
of
auburn
during
all
which
time
i
have
been
well
acquainted
with
her
she
has
all
the
characteristics
of
the
pure
african
race
strongly
marked
upon
her
though
from
which
one
of
the
various
tribes
that
once
fed
the
barracoons
on
the
guinea
coast
she
derived
her
indomitable
courage
and
her
passionate
love
of
freedom
i
know
not
perhaps
from
the
fellatas
in
whom
those
traits
were
predominant
harriet
lives
upon
a
farm
which
the
twelve
hundred
dollars
given
her
by
bradford
from
the
proceeds
of
the
first
edition
of
this
little
book
enabled
her
to
redeem
from
a
mortgage
held
by
the
late
secretary
seward
her
household
is
very
likely
to
consist
of
several
old
black
people
bad
with
the
rheumatize
some
forlorn
wandering
woman
and
a
couple
of
small
images
of
god
cut
in
ebony
how
she
manages
to
feed
and
clothe
herself
and
them
the
lord
best
knows
she
has
too
much
pride
and
too
much
faith
to
beg
she
takes
thankfully
but
without
any
great
effusiveness
of
gratitude
whatever
messengers
bring
her
i
have
never
heard
that
she
absolutely
lacked
there
are
some
good
people
in
various
parts
of
the
country
into
whose
hearts
god
sends
the
thought
from
time
to
time
that
harriet
may
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
flour
sack
or
of
the
potatoes
and
the
help
in
time
of
need
comes
to
her
harriet
simplicity
and
ignorance
have
in
some
cases
been
imposed
upon
very
signally
in
one
instance
in
auburn
a
few
years
ago
but
nobody
who
knows
her
has
the
slightest
doubt
of
her
perfect
integrity
the
following
sketch
taken
by
bradford
chiefly
from
harriet
own
recollections
which
are
wonderfully
distinct
and
minute
but
also
from
other
corroborative
sources
gives
but
a
very
imperfect
account
of
what
this
woman
has
been
her
color
and
the
servile
condition
in
which
she
was
born
and
reared
have
doomed
her
to
obscurity
but
a
more
heroic
soul
did
not
breathe
in
the
bosom
of
judith
or
of
jeanne
no
fear
of
the
lash
the
or
the
fiery
stake
could
divert
her
from
her
task
of
leading
as
many
as
possible
of
her
people
from
the
land
of
egypt
from
the
house
of
bondage
the
book
is
good
literature
for
the
black
race
or
the
white
race
and
though
no
similar
conditions
may
arise
to
test
the
possibilities
that
are
in
any
of
them
yet
the
example
of
this
poor
slave
woman
may
well
stand
out
before
them
and
before
all
people
black
or
white
to
show
what
a
lofty
and
martyr
spirit
may
accomplish
struggling
against
overwhelming
obstacles
harriet
the
moses
of
her
people
on
a
hot
summer
day
perhaps
sixty
years
ago
a
group
of
merry
little
darkies
were
rolling
and
tumbling
in
the
sand
in
front
of
the
large
house
of
a
southern
planter
their
shining
skins
gleamed
in
the
sun
as
they
rolled
over
each
other
in
their
play
and
their
voices
as
they
chattered
together
or
shouted
in
glee
reached
even
to
the
cabins
of
the
negro
quarter
where
the
old
people
groaned
in
spirit
as
they
thought
of
the
future
of
those
unconscious
young
revelers
and
their
cry
went
up
o
lord
how
long
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
children
on
the
top
rail
of
a
fence
holding
tight
on
to
the
tall
gate
post
sat
a
little
girl
of
perhaps
thirteen
years
of
age
darker
than
any
of
the
others
and
with
a
more
decided
in
the
hair
a
pure
unmitigated
african
she
was
not
so
entirely
in
a
state
of
nature
as
the
rollers
in
the
dust
beneath
her
but
her
only
garment
was
a
short
woolen
skirt
which
was
tied
around
her
waist
and
reached
about
to
her
knees
she
seemed
a
dazed
and
stupid
child
and
as
her
head
hung
upon
her
breast
she
looked
up
with
dull
eyes
towards
her
young
brothers
and
sisters
without
seeming
to
see
them
bye
and
bye
the
eyes
closed
and
still
clinging
to
the
post
she
slept
the
other
children
looked
up
and
said
to
each
other
look
at
hatt
she
done
gone
off
agin
tired
of
their
present
play
ground
they
trooped
off
in
another
direction
but
the
girl
slept
on
heavily
never
losing
her
hold
on
the
post
or
her
seat
on
her
perch
behold
here
in
the
stupid
little
negro
girl
the
future
deliverer
of
hundreds
of
her
people
the
spy
and
scout
of
the
union
armies
the
devoted
hospital
nurse
the
protector
of
hunted
fugitives
the
eloquent
speaker
in
public
meetings
the
cunning
eluder
of
pursuing
the
heaven
guided
pioneer
through
dangers
seen
and
unseen
in
short
as
she
has
well
been
called
the
moses
of
her
people
here
in
her
thirteenth
year
she
is
just
recovering
from
the
first
terrible
effects
of
an
injury
inflicted
by
her
master
who
in
an
ungovernable
fit
of
rage
threw
a
heavy
weight
at
the
unoffending
child
breaking
in
her
skull
and
causing
a
pressure
upon
her
brain
from
which
in
her
old
age
she
is
suffering
still
this
pressure
it
was
which
caused
the
fits
of
somnolency
so
frequently
to
come
upon
her
and
which
gave
her
the
appearance
of
being
stupid
and
in
those
early
years
but
that
brain
which
seemed
so
dull
was
full
of
busy
thoughts
and
her
life
problem
was
already
trying
to
work
itself
out
there
she
had
heard
the
shrieks
and
cries
of
women
who
were
being
flogged
in
the
negro
quarter
she
had
listened
to
the
groaned
out
prayer
oh
lord
have
mercy
she
had
already
seen
two
older
sisters
taken
away
as
part
of
a
chain
gang
and
they
had
gone
no
one
knew
whither
she
had
seen
the
agonized
expression
on
their
faces
as
they
turned
to
take
a
last
look
at
their
old
cabin
home
and
had
watched
them
from
the
top
of
the
fence
as
they
went
off
weeping
and
lamenting
till
they
were
hidden
from
her
sight
forever
she
saw
the
hopeless
grief
of
the
poor
old
mother
and
the
silent
despair
of
the
aged
father
and
already
she
began
to
revolve
in
her
mind
the
question
why
should
such
things
be
is
there
no
deliverance
for
my
people
the
sun
shone
on
and
harriet
still
slept
seated
on
the
fence
rail
they
those
others
had
no
anxious
dreams
of
the
future
and
even
the
occasional
sufferings
of
the
present
time
caused
them
but
a
temporary
grief
plenty
to
eat
and
warm
sunshine
to
bask
in
were
enough
to
constitute
their
happiness
harriet
however
was
not
one
of
these
god
had
a
great
work
for
her
to
do
in
the
world
and
the
discipline
and
hardship
through
which
she
passed
in
her
early
years
were
only
preparing
her
for
her
after
life
of
adventure
and
trial
and
through
these
to
come
out
as
the
savior
and
deliverer
of
her
people
when
she
came
to
years
of
womanhood
as
yet
she
had
seen
no
visions
and
heard
no
voices
no
foreshadowing
of
her
life
of
toil
and
privation
of
flight
before
human
of
watchings
and
hidings
of
perils
by
land
and
perils
by
sea
yea
and
of
perils
by
false
brethren
or
of
miraculous
deliverance
had
yet
come
to
her
no
hint
of
the
great
mission
of
her
life
to
guide
her
people
from
the
land
of
bondage
to
the
land
of
freedom
but
why
should
such
things
be
and
is
there
no
help
these
were
the
questions
of
her
waking
hours
the
dilapidated
state
of
things
about
the
great
house
told
truly
the
story
of
waning
fortunes
and
poverty
was
pressing
upon
the
master
one
by
one
the
slaves
disappeared
some
were
sold
others
hired
to
other
masters
no
questions
were
asked
no
information
given
they
simply
disappeared
a
lady
for
so
she
was
designated
came
driving
up
to
the
great
house
one
day
to
see
if
she
could
find
there
a
young
girl
to
take
care
of
a
baby
the
lady
wished
to
pay
low
wages
and
so
the
most
stupid
and
the
most
incapable
of
the
children
on
the
plantation
was
chosen
to
go
with
her
harriet
who
could
command
less
wages
than
any
other
child
of
her
age
on
the
plantation
was
therefore
put
into
the
wagon
without
a
word
of
explanation
and
driven
off
to
the
lady
house
it
was
not
a
very
fine
house
but
harriet
had
never
before
been
in
any
dwelling
better
than
the
cabins
of
the
negro
quarter
she
was
engaged
as
child
nurse
but
she
soon
found
that
she
was
expected
to
be
maid
of
all
work
by
day
as
well
as
child
nurse
by
night
the
first
task
that
was
set
her
was
that
of
sweeping
and
dusting
a
parlor
no
information
was
vouchsafed
as
to
the
manner
of
going
about
this
work
but
she
had
often
swept
out
the
cabin
and
this
part
of
her
task
was
successfully
accomplished
then
at
once
she
took
the
dusting
cloth
and
wiped
off
tables
chairs
and
the
dust
as
dust
will
do
when
it
has
nowhere
else
to
go
at
once
settled
again
and
chairs
and
tables
were
soon
covered
with
a
white
coating
telling
a
terrible
tale
against
harriet
when
her
mistress
came
in
to
see
how
the
work
progressed
reproaches
and
savage
words
fell
upon
the
ears
of
the
frightened
child
and
she
was
commanded
to
do
the
work
all
over
again
it
was
done
in
precisely
the
same
way
as
before
with
the
same
result
then
the
whip
was
brought
into
requisition
and
it
was
laid
on
with
no
light
hand
five
times
before
breakfast
this
process
was
repeated
when
a
new
actor
appeared
upon
the
scene
miss
emily
a
sister
of
the
mistress
had
been
roused
from
her
morning
slumber
by
the
sound
of
the
whip
and
the
screams
of
the
child
and
being
of
a
less
imperious
nature
than
her
sister
she
had
come
in
to
try
to
set
matters
right
why
do
you
whip
the
child
susan
for
not
doing
what
she
has
never
been
taught
to
do
leave
her
to
me
a
few
minutes
and
you
will
see
that
she
will
soon
learn
how
to
sweep
and
dust
a
room
then
miss
emily
instructed
the
child
to
open
the
windows
and
sweep
then
to
leave
the
room
and
set
the
table
while
the
dust
settled
and
after
that
to
return
and
wipe
it
off
there
was
no
more
trouble
of
that
kind
a
few
words
might
have
set
the
matter
right
before
but
in
those
days
many
a
poor
slave
suffered
for
the
stupidity
and
obstinacy
of
a
master
or
mistress
more
stupid
than
themselves
when
the
labors
unremitted
for
a
moment
of
the
long
day
were
over
for
this
mistress
was
an
economical
woman
and
intended
to
get
the
worth
of
her
money
to
the
uttermost
farthing
there
was
still
no
rest
for
the
weary
child
for
there
was
a
cross
baby
to
be
rocked
continuously
lest
it
should
wake
and
disturb
the
mother
rest
the
black
child
sat
beside
the
cradle
of
the
white
child
so
near
the
bed
that
the
lash
of
the
whip
would
reach
her
if
she
ventured
for
a
moment
to
forget
her
fatigues
and
sufferings
in
sleep
the
mistress
reposed
upon
her
bed
with
the
whip
on
a
little
shelf
over
her
head
people
of
color
are
unfortunately
so
constituted
that
even
if
the
pressure
of
a
broken
skull
does
not
cause
a
sleep
like
the
sleep
of
the
dead
the
need
of
rest
and
the
refreshment
of
slumber
after
a
day
of
toil
were
often
felt
by
them
no
doubt
this
was
a
great
wrong
to
their
masters
and
a
cheating
them
of
time
which
belonged
to
them
but
their
slaves
did
not
always
look
upon
it
in
that
light
and
tired
nature
would
demand
her
rights
and
so
nature
and
the
mistress
had
a
fight
for
it
rock
rock
went
the
cradle
and
mother
and
child
slept
but
alas
the
little
black
hand
would
sometimes
slip
down
and
the
head
would
droop
and
a
dream
of
home
and
mother
would
visit
the
weary
one
only
to
be
roughly
dispelled
by
the
swift
descent
of
the
stinging
lash
for
the
baby
had
cried
out
and
the
mother
had
been
awakened
this
is
no
fictitious
tale
that
poor
neck
is
even
now
covered
with
the
scars
which
sixty
years
of
life
have
not
been
able
to
efface
it
may
be
that
she
was
thus
being
prepared
by
the
long
habit
of
enforced
wakefulness
for
the
night
watches
in
the
woods
and
in
dens
and
caves
of
the
earth
when
the
pursuers
were
on
her
track
and
the
terrified
ones
were
trembling
in
her
shadow
we
do
not
thank
for
this
cruel
woman
for
if
you
did
her
a
service
you
did
it
ignorantly
and
only
for
your
own
gratification
but
harriet
powers
of
endurance
failed
at
last
and
she
was
returned
to
her
master
a
poor
scarred
wreck
nothing
but
skin
and
bone
with
the
words
that
she
was
worth
a
sixpence
the
poor
old
mother
nursed
her
back
to
life
and
her
naturally
good
constitution
asserted
itself
so
that
as
she
grew
older
she
began
to
show
signs
of
the
wonderful
strength
which
in
after
years
when
the
fugitive
slave
law
was
in
operation
in
new
york
state
enabled
her
to
seize
a
man
from
the
officers
who
had
him
in
charge
and
while
numbers
were
pursuing
her
and
the
shot
was
flying
like
hail
about
her
head
to
bear
him
in
her
own
strong
arms
beyond
the
reach
of
danger
as
soon
as
she
was
strong
enough
for
work
harriet
was
hired
out
to
a
man
whose
tyranny
was
worse
if
possible
than
that
of
the
woman
she
had
left
now
it
was
out
of
door
drudgery
which
was
put
upon
her
the
labor
of
the
horse
and
the
ox
the
lifting
of
barrels
of
flour
and
other
heavy
weights
were
given
to
her
and
powerful
men
often
stood
astonished
to
see
this
woman
perform
feats
of
strength
from
which
they
shrunk
incapable
this
cruelty
she
looks
upon
as
a
blessing
in
disguise
a
very
questionable
shape
the
blessing
took
methinks
for
by
it
she
was
prepared
for
after
needs
still
the
pressure
upon
the
brain
continued
and
with
the
weight
half
lifted
she
would
drop
off
into
a
state
of
insensibility
from
which
even
the
lash
in
the
hand
of
a
strong
man
could
not
rouse
her
but
if
they
had
only
known
it
the
touch
of
a
gentle
hand
upon
her
shoulder
and
her
name
spoken
in
tones
of
kindness
would
have
accomplished
what
cruelty
failed
to
do
the
day
work
must
be
accomplished
whether
the
head
was
racked
with
pain
and
the
frame
was
consumed
by
fever
or
not
but
the
day
came
at
length
when
poor
harriet
could
work
no
more
the
sting
of
the
lash
had
no
power
to
rouse
her
now
and
the
new
master
finding
her
a
dead
weight
on
his
hands
returned
the
useless
piece
of
property
to
him
who
was
called
her
owner
and
while
she
lay
there
helpless
this
man
was
bringing
other
men
to
look
at
her
and
offering
her
for
sale
at
the
lowest
possible
price
at
the
same
time
setting
forth
her
capabilities
if
once
she
were
strong
and
well
again
harriet
religious
character
i
have
not
yet
touched
upon
brought
up
by
parents
possessed
of
strong
faith
in
god
she
had
never
known
the
time
i
imagine
when
she
did
not
trust
him
and
cling
to
him
with
an
confidence
she
seemed
ever
to
feel
the
divine
presence
near
and
she
talked
with
god
as
a
man
talketh
with
his
friend
hers
was
not
the
religion
of
a
morning
and
evening
prayer
at
stated
times
but
when
she
felt
a
need
she
simply
told
god
of
it
and
trusted
him
to
set
the
matter
right
and
so
she
said
to
me
as
i
lay
so
sick
on
my
bed
from
christmas
till
march
i
was
always
praying
for
poor
ole
master
like
i
did
do
nothing
but
pray
for
ole
master
lord
convert
ole
master
dear
lord

dat
man
heart
and
make
him
a
christian
and
all
the
time
he
was
bringing
men
to
look
at
me
and
dey
stood
there
saying
what
dey
would
give
and
what
dey
would
take
and
all
i
could
say
was
lord
convert
ole
master
den
i
heard
dat
as
soon
as
i
was
able
to
move
i
was
to
be
sent
with
my
brudders
in
the
to
de
far
south
then
i
changed
my
prayer
and
i
said
if

going
to
change
dat
man
heart
lord
and
take
him
out
of
de
way
so
he
wo
do
no
more
mischief
next
ting
i
heard
ole
master
was
dead
and
he
died
just
as
he
had
lived
a
wicked
bad
man
oh
den
it
like
i
would
give

of
silver
and
gold
if
i
had
it
to
bring
dat
pore
soul
back
i
would
give
i
would
give
eberyting
but
he
was
gone
i
pray
for
him
no
more
as
she
recovered
from
this
long
illness
a
deeper
religious
spirit
seemed
to
take
possession
of
her
than
she
had
ever
experienced
before
she
literally
prayed
without
ceasing
like
i
prayed
all
de
time
she
said
about
my
work
eberywhere
i
was
always
talking
to
de
lord
when
i
went
to
the
to
wash
my
face
and
took
up
de
water
in
my
hands
i
said
lord
wash
me
make
me
clean
when
i
took
up
de
towel
to
wipe
my
face
and
hands
i
cried
lord
for
jesus
sake
wipe
away
all
my
sins
when
i
took
up
de
broom
and
began
to
sweep
i
groaned
lord
whatsoebber

dere
be
in
my
heart
sweep
it
out
lord
clar
and
clean
but
i
ca
pray
no
more
for
pore
ole
master
no
words
can
describe
the
pathos
of
her
tones
as
she
broke
into
these
words
of
earnest
supplication
what
was
to
become
of
the
slaves
on
this
plantation
now
that
the
master
was
dead
were
they
all
to
be
scattered
and
sent
to
different
parts
of
the
country
harriet
had
many
brothers
and
sisters
all
of
whom
with
the
exception
of
the
two
who
had
gone
south
with
the
were
living
on
this
plantation
or
were
hired
out
to
planters
not
far
away
the
word
passed
through
the
cabins
that
another
owner
was
coming
in
and
that
none
of
the
slaves
were
to
be
sold
out
of
the
state
this
assurance
satisfied
the
others
but
it
did
not
satisfy
harriet
already
the
inward
monitor
was
whispering
to
her
arise
flee
for
your
life
and
in
the
visions
of
the
night
she
saw
the
horsemen
coming
and
heard
the
shrieks
of
women
and
children
as
they
were
being
torn
from
each
other
and
hurried
off
no
one
knew
whither
and
beckoning
hands
were
ever
motioning
her
to
come
and
she
seemed
to
see
a
line
dividing
the
land
of
slavery
from
the
land
of
freedom
and
on
the
other
side
of
that
line
she
saw
lovely
white
ladies
waiting
to
welcome
her
and
to
care
for
her
already
in
her
mind
her
people
were
the
israelites
in
the
land
of
egypt
while
far
away
to
the
north
was
the
land
of
canaan
but
had
she
as
yet
any
prevision
that
was
to
be
the
moses
who
was
to
be
their
leader
through
clouds
of
darkness
and
fear
and
fires
of
tribulation
to
that
promised
land
this
she
never
said
one
day
there
were
scared
faces
seen
in
the
negro
quarter
and
hurried
whispers
passed
from
one
to
another
no
one
knew
how
it
had
come
out
but
some
one
had
heard
that
harriet
and
two
of
her
brothers
were
very
soon
perhaps
perhaps
to
be
sent
far
south
with
a
gang
bought
up
for
plantation
work
harriet
was
about
twenty
or
years
old
at
this
time
and
the
constantly
recurring
idea
of
escape
at
took
sudden
form
that
day
and
with
her
usual
promptitude
of
action
she
was
ready
to
start
at
once
she
held
a
hurried
consultation
with
her
brothers
in
which
she
so
wrought
upon
their
fears
that
they
expressed
themselves
as
willing
to
start
with
her
that
very
night
for
that
far
north
where
could
they
reach
it
in
safety
freedom
awaited
them
but
she
must
first
give
some
intimation
of
her
purpose
to
the
friends
she
was
to
leave
behind
so
that
even
if
not
understood
at
the
time
it
might
be
remembered
afterward
as
her
intended
farewell
slaves
must
not
be
seen
talking
together
and
so
it
came
about
that
their
communication
was
often
made
by
singing
and
the
words
of
their
familiar
hymns
telling
of
the
heavenly
journey
and
the
land
of
canaan
while
they
did
not
attract
the
attention
of
the
masters
conveyed
to
their
brethren
and
sisters
in
bondage
something
more
than
met
the
ear
and
so
she
sang
accompanying
the
words
when
for
a
moment
unwatched
with
a
meaning
look
to
one
and
another
when
dat
ar
ole
chariot
comes
i
gwine
to
lebe
you
i
boun
for
de
promised
land
frien
i
gwine
to
lebe
you
again
as
she
passed
the
doors
of
the
different
cabins
she
lifted
up
her
voice
and
many
a
dusky
face
appeared
at
door
or
window
with
a
wondering
or
scared
expression
and
thus
she
continued
i
sorry
frien
to
lebe
you
farewell
oh
farewell
but
i
meet
you
in
de
mornin
farewell
oh
farewell
i
meet
you
in
de
mornin
when
you
reach
de
promised
land
on
de
oder
side
of
jordan
for
i
boun
for
de
promised
land
the
brothers
started
with
her
but
the
way
was
strange
the
north
was
far
away
and
all
unknown
the
masters
would
pursue
and
recapture
them
and
their
fate
would
be
worse
than
ever
before
and
so
they
broke
away
from
her
and
bidding
her
goodbye
they
hastened
back
to
the
known
horrors
of
slavery
and
the
dread
of
that
which
was
worse
harriet
was
now
left
alone
but
after
watching
the
retreating
forms
of
her
brothers
she
turned
her
face
toward
the
north
and
fixing
her
eyes
on
the
guiding
star
and
committing
her
way
unto
the
lord
she
started
again
upon
her
long
lonely
journey
her
farewell
song
was
long
remembered
in
the
cabins
and
the
old
mother
sat
and
wept
for
her
lost
child
no
intimation
had
been
given
her
of
harriet
intention
for
the
old
woman
was
of
a
most
impulsive
disposition
and
her
cries
and
lamentations
would
have
made
known
to
all
within
hearing
harriet
intended
escape
and
so
with
only
the
north
star
for
her
guide
our
heroine
started
on
the
way
to
liberty
for
said
she
i
had
reasoned
dis
out
in
my
mind
there
was
one
of
two
things
i
had
a
to
liberty
or
death
if
i
could
not
have
one
i
would
have
de
oder
for
no
man
should
take
me
alive
i
should
fight
for
my
liberty
as
long
as
my
strength
lasted
and
when
de
time
came
for
me
to
go
de
lord
would
let
dem
take
me
and
so
without
money
and
without
friends
she
started
on
through
unknown
regions
walking
by
night
hiding
by
day
but
always
conscious
of
an
invisible
pillar
of
cloud
by
day
and
of
fire
by
night
under
the
guidance
of
which
she
journeyed
or
rested
without
knowing
whom
to
trust
or
how
near
the
pursuers
might
be
she
carefully
felt
her
way
and
by
her
native
cunning
or
by
god
given
wisdom
she
managed
to
apply
to
the
right
people
for
food
and
sometimes
for
shelter
though
often
her
bed
was
only
the
cold
ground
and
her
watchers
the
stars
of
night
after
many
long
and
weary
days
of
travel
she
found
that
she
had
passed
the
magic
line
which
then
divided
the
land
of
bondage
from
the
land
of
freedom
but
where
were
the
lovely
white
ladies
whom
in
her
visions
she
had
seen
who
with
arms
outstretched
welcomed
her
to
their
hearts
and
homes
all
these
visions
proved
deceitful
she
was
more
alone
than
ever
but
she
had
crossed
the
line
no
one
could
take
her
now
and
she
would
never
call
any
man
master
more
i
looked
at
my
hands
she
said
to
see
if
i
was
de
same
person
now
i
was
free
dere
was
such
a
glory
ober
eberything
de
sun
came
like
gold
trou
de
trees
and
ober
de
fields
and
i
felt
like
i
was
in
heaven
but
then
came
the
bitter
drop
in
the
cup
of
joy
she
was
alone
and
her
kindred
were
in
slavery
and
not
one
of
them
had
the
courage
to
dare
what
she
had
dared
unless
she
made
the
effort
to
liberate
them
she
would
never
see
them
more
or
even
know
their
fate
i
knew
of
a
man
she
said
who
was
sent
to
the
state
prison
for
years
all
these
years
he
was
always
thinking
of
his
home
and
counting
by
years
months
and
days
the
time
till
he
should
be
free
and
see
his
family
and
friends
once
more
the
years
roll
on
the
time
of
imprisonment
is
over
the
man
is
free
he
leaves
the
prison
gates
he
makes
his
way
to
his
old
home
but
his
old
home
is
not
there
the
house
in
which
he
had
dwelt
in
his
childhood
had
been
torn
down
and
a
new
one
had
been
put
up
in
its
place
his
family
were
gone
their
very
name
was
forgotten
there
was
no
one
to
take
him
by
the
hand
to
welcome
him
back
to
life
so
it
was
wid
me
said
harriet
i
had
crossed
de
line
of
which
i
had
so
long
been
dreaming
i
was
free
but
dere
was
no
one
to
welcome
me
to
de
land
of
freedom
i
was
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
and
my
home
after
all
was
down
in
de
old
cabin
quarter
wid
de
ole
folks
and
my
brudders
and
sisters
but
to
dis
solemn
resolution

make
a
home
for

in
de
north
and
de
lord
helping

i
would
bring

all
dere
oh
how
i
prayed
den
lying
all
alone
on
de
cold
damp
ground
dear
lord
i
said
haint
got
no
friend
but
come
to
my
help
lord
for
i
in
trouble
it
would
be
impossible
here
to
give
a
detailed
account
of
the
journeys
and
labors
of
this
intrepid
woman
for
the
redemption
of
her
kindred
and
friends
during
the
years
that
followed
those
years
were
spent
in
work
almost
by
night
and
day
with
the
one
object
of
the
rescue
of
her
people
from
slavery
all
her
wages
were
laid
away
with
this
sole
purpose
and
as
soon
as
a
sufficient
amount
was
secured
she
disappeared
from
her
northern
home
and
as
suddenly
and
mysteriously
she
appeared
some
dark
night
at
the
door
of
one
of
the
cabins
on
a
plantation
where
a
trembling
band
of
fugitives
forewarned
as
to
time
and
place
were
anxiously
awaiting
their
deliverer
then
she
piloted
them
north
traveling
by
night
hiding
by
day
scaling
the
mountains
fording
the
rivers
threading
the
forests
lying
concealed
as
the
pursuers
passed
them
she
carrying
the
babies
drugged
with
paregoric
in
a
basket
on
her
arm
so
she
went
times
and
so
she
brought
away
over
three
hundred
pieces
of
living
and
breathing
property
with
god
given
souls
the
way
was
so
toilsome
over
the
rugged
mountain
passes
that
often
the
who
followed
her
would
give
out
and
and
bleeding
they
would
drop
on
the
ground
groaning
that
they
could
not
take
another
step
they
would
lie
there
and
die
or
if
strength
came
back
they
would
return
on
their
steps
and
seek
their
old
homes
again
then
the
revolver
carried
by
this
bold
and
daring
pioneer
would
come
out
while
pointing
it
at
their
heads
she
would
say
dead
niggers
tell
no
tales
you
go
on
or
die
and
by
this
heroic
treatment
she
compelled
them
to
drag
their
weary
limbs
along
on
their
northward
journey
but
the
pursuers
were
after
them
a
reward
of
was
offered
by
the
of
the
region
from
whence
so
many
slaves
had
been
spirited
away
for
the
head
of
the
woman
who
appeared
so
mysteriously
and
enticed
away
their
property
from
under
the
very
eyes
of
its
owners
our
sagacious
heroine
has
been
in
the
car
having
sent
her
frightened
party
round
by
some
railway
and
has
heard
this
advertisement
which
was
posted
over
her
head
read
by
others
of
the
passengers
she
never
could
read
or
write
herself
but
knowing
that
suspicion
would
be
likely
to
fall
upon
any
black
woman
traveling
north
she
would
turn
at
the
next
station
and
journey
towards
the
south
who
would
suspect
a
fugitive
with
such
a
price
set
upon
her
head
of
rushing
at
railway
speed
into
the
jaws
of
destruction
with
a
daring
almost
heedless
she
went
even
to
the
very
village
where
she
would
be
most
likely
to
meet
one
of
the
masters
to
whom
she
had
been
hired
and
having
stopped
at
the
market
and
bought
a
pair
of
live
fowls
she
went
along
the
street
with
her
well
over
her
face
and
with
the
bent
and
decrepit
air
of
an
aged
woman
suddenly
on
turning
a
corner
she
spied
her
old
master
coming
towards
her
she
pulled
the
string
which
tied
the
legs
of
the
chickens
they
began
to
flutter
and
scream
and
as
her
master
passed
she
was
stooping
and
busily
engaged
in
attending
to
the
fluttering
fowls
and
he
went
on
his
way
little
thinking
that
he
was
brushing
the
very
garments
of
the
woman
who
had
dared
to
steal
herself
and
others
of
his
belongings
at
one
time
the
pursuit
was
very
close
and
vigorous
the
woods
were
scoured
in
all
directions
every
house
was
visited
and
every
person
stopped
and
questioned
as
to
a
band
of
black
fugitives
known
to
be
fleeing
through
that
part
of
the
country
harriet
had
a
large
party
with
her
then
the
children
were
sleeping
the
sound
sleep
that
opium
gives
but
all
the
others
were
on
the
alert
each
one
hidden
behind
his
own
tree
and
silent
as
death
they
had
been
long
without
food
and
were
nearly
famished
and
as
the
pursuers
seemed
to
have
passed
on
harriet
decided
to
make
the
attempt
to
reach
a
certain
station
of
the
underground
railroad
well
known
to
her
and
procure
food
for
her
starving
party
under
cover
of
the
darkness
she
started
leaving
a
cowering
and
trembling
group
in
the
woods
to
whom
a
fluttering
leaf
or
a
moving
animal
were
a
sound
of
dread
bringing
their
hearts
into
their
throats
how
long
she
is
away
has
she
been
caught
and
carried
off
and
if
so
what
is
to
become
of
them
hark
there
is
a
sound
of
singing
in
the
distance
coming
nearer
and
nearer
and
these
are
the
words
of
the
unseen
singer
which
i
wish
i
could
give
you
as
i
have
so
often
heard
them
sung
by
herself
hail
oh
hail
ye
happy
spirits
death
no
more
shall
make
you
fear
grief
nor
sorrow
pain
nor
anguish
shall
no
more
distress
you
dere
around
him
are
ten
thousand
angels
always
ready
to
obey
command
dey
are
always
hovering
round
you
till
you
reach
de
heavenly
land
jesus
jesus
will
go
wid
you
he
will
lead
you
to
his
throne
he
who
died
has
gone
before
you
trod
de
all
alone
he
whose
thunders
shake
creation
he
who
bids
de
planets
roll
he
who
rides
upon
the
tempest
and
whose
scepter
sways
de
whole
dark
and
thorny
is
de
pathway
where
de
pilgrim
makes
his
ways
but
beyond
dis
vale
of
sorrow
lie
de
fields
of
endless
days
the
air
sung
to
these
words
was
so
wild
so
full
of
plaintive
minor
strains
and
unexpected
quavers
that
i
would
defy
any
white
person
to
learn
it
and
often
as
i
heard
it
it
was
to
me
a
constant
surprise
up
and
down
the
road
she
passes
to
see
if
the
coast
is
clear
and
then
to
make
them
certain
that
it
is
leader
who
is
coming
she
breaks
out
into
the
plaintive
strains
of
the
song
forbidden
to
her
people
at
the
south
but
which
she
and
her
followers
delight
to
sing
together
oh
go
down
moses
way
down
into
egypt
land
tell
old
pharaoh
let
my
people
go
oh
pharaoh
said
he
would
go
cross
let
my
people
go
and
do
get
lost
in
de
wilderness
let
my
people
go
oh
go
down
moses
way
down
into
egypt
land
tell
old
pharaoh
let
my
people
go
you
may
hinder
me
here
but
you
ca
up
dere
let
my
people
go
he
sits
in
de
hebben
and
answers
prayer
let
my
people
go
oh
go
down
moses
way
down
into
egypt
land
tell
old
pharaoh
let
my
people
go
and
then
she
enters
the
recesses
of
the
wood
carrying
hope
and
comfort
to
the
anxious
watchers
there
one
by
one
they
steal
out
from
their
hiding
places
and
are
fed
and
strengthened
for
another
night
journey
and
so
by
night
travel
by
signals
by
threatenings
by
encouragement
through
watchings
and
fastings
and
i
may
say
by
direct
interpositions
of
providence
and
miraculous
deliverances
she
brought
her
people
to
what
was
then
their
land
of
canaan
the
state
of
new
york
but
alas
this
state
did
not
continue
to
be
their
refuge
for
in
i
think
the
fugitive
slave
law
was
put
in
force
which
bound
the
people
north
of
mason
and
dixon
line
to
return
to
bondage
any
fugitive
found
in
their
territories
after
that
said
harriet
i
would
trust
uncle
sam
wid
my
people
no
longer
but
i
brought
all
clar
off
to
canada
on
her
seventh
or
eighth
journey
she
brought
with
her
a
band
of
fugitives
among
whom
was
a
very
remarkable
man
whom
i
knew
only
by
the
name
of
joe
joe
was
a
noble
specimen
of
a
negro
enormously
tall
and
of
splendid
muscular
development
he
had
been
hired
out
by
his
master
to
another
planter
for
whom
he
had
worked
for
six
years
saving
him
all
the
expense
of
an
overseer
and
taking
all
trouble
off
from
his
hands
he
was
such
a
very
valuable
piece
of
property
and
had
become
so
absolutely
necessary
to
the
planter
to
whom
he
was
hired
that
he
determined
to
buy
him
at
any
cost
his
old
master
held
him
proportionately
high
but
by
paying
one
thousand
dollars
down
and
promising
to
pay
another
thousand
in
a
certain
time
the
purchase
was
made
and
this
chattel
passed
over
into
the
hands
of
a
new
owner
the
morning
after
the
purchase
was
completed
the
new
master
came
riding
down
on
a
tall
powerful
horse
into
the
negro
quarter
with
a
strong
new
rawhide
in
his
hand
and
stopping
before
joe
cabin
called
to
him
to
come
out
joe
was
just
eating
his
breakfast
but
with
ready
obedience
he
hastened
out
at
the
summons
slave
as
he
was
and
accustomed
to
scenes
of
brutality
he
was
surprised
when
the
order
came
now
joe
strip
and
take
a
licking
naturally
enough
he
demurred
at
first
and
thought
of
resisting
the
order
but
he
called
to
mind
a
scene
he
had
witnessed
a
few
days
before
in
the
field
the
particulars
of
which
are
too
horrible
to
be
given
here
and
he
thought
it
the
wisest
course
to
submit
but
first
he
tried
a
gentle
remonstrance
said
he
hab
i
always
been
faithful
to
you
hab
i
worked
through
sun
an
rain
early
in
de
mornin
an
late
at
night
hab
i
saved
you
an
oberseer
by
doin
his
work
hab
you
anything
to
complain
agin
me
no
joe
i
have
no
complaint
to
make
of
you
you
a
good
nigger
an
you
always
worked
well
but
you
belong
to
now
you
nigger
and
the
first
lesson
my
niggers
have
to
learn
is
that
i
am
master
and
they
belong
to
me
and
are
never
to
resist
anything
i
order
them
to
do
so
i
always
begin
by
giving
them
a
good
licking
now
strip
and
take
it
joe
saw
that
there
was
no
help
for
him
and
that
for
the
time
he
must
submit
he
stripped
off
his
clothing
and
took
his
flogging
without
a
word
but
as
he
drew
his
shirt
up
over
his
torn
and
bleeding
back
he
said
to
himself
dis
is
de
first
an
de
last
as
soon
as
he
was
able
he
took
a
boat
and
under
cover
of
the
night
rowed
down
the
river
and
made
his
way
to
the
cabin
of
old
ben
harriet
father
and
said
to
him
nex
time
comes
let
me
know
it
was
not
long
after
this
time
that
the
mysterious
woman
appeared
the
woman
on
whom
no
one
could
lay
his
finger
and
men
women
and
children
began
to
disappear
from
the
plantations
one
fine
morning
joe
was
missing
and
call
as
loud
as
he
might
the
master
voice
had
no
power
to
bring
him
forth
joe
had
certainly
fled
and
his
brother
william
was
gone
and
peter
and
eliza
from
other
plantations
other
slaves
were
missing
and
before
their
masters
were
awake
to
the
fact
the
party
of
fugitives
following
their
intrepid
leader
were
far
on
their
way
towards
liberty
the
adventures
of
this
escaping
party
would
of
themselves
fill
a
volume
they
hid
in
potato
holes
by
day
while
their
pursuers
passed
within
a
few
feet
of
them
they
were
passed
along
by
friends
in
various
disguises
they
scattered
and
separated
some
traveling
by
boat
some
by
wagons
some
by
cars
others
on
foot
to
meet
at
some
specified
station
of
the
railroad
they
met
at
the
house
of
sam
green
a
the
man
who
was
afterwards
sent
to
prison
for
ten
years
for
having
a
copy
of
uncle
cabin
in
his
house
and
so
hunted
and
hiding
and
wandering
they
found
themselves
at
last
at
the
entrance
of
the
long
bridge
which
crosses
the
river
at
wilmington
delaware
footnote
a
in
mentioning
to
me
the
circumstances
of
sam
imprisonment
harriet
who
had
no
acquaintance
with
books
merely
mentioned
the
fact
as
it
had
come
to
her
own
knowledge
but
i
have
lately
come
across
a
book
in
the
astor
library
which
confirms
the
story
precisely
as
she
stated
it
it
is
in
a
book
by
rev
john
dixon
long
of
philadelphia
he
says
samuel
green
a
free
colored
man
of
dorchester
county
maryland
was
sentenced
to
ten
years
confinement
in
the
maryland
state
prison
at
the
spring
term
of
the
county
court
held
in
cambridge
md
what
was
the
crime
imputed
to
this
man
born
on
american
soil
a
man
of
good
moral
character
a
local
preacher
in
the
methodist
episcopal
church
a
husband
and
a
father
simply
this
a
copy
of
tom
cabin
been
found
in
his
it
was
not
proved
that
he
had
ever
read
it
to
the
colored
people
no
time
had
been
lost
in
posting
up
advertisements
and
offering
rewards
for
the
capture
of
these
fugitives
for
joe
in
particular
the
reward
offered
was
very
high
first
a
thousand
dollars
then
fifteen
hundred
and
then
two
thousand
an
all
expenses
clar
clean
for
his
body
in
easton
jail
this
high
reward
stimulated
the
efforts
of
the
officers
who
were
usually
on
the
lookout
for
escaping
fugitives
and
the
added
rewards
for
others
of
the
party
and
the
high
price
set
on
harriet
head
filled
the
woods
and
highways
with
eager
hunters
after
human
prey
when
harriet
and
her
companions
approached
the
long
wilmington
bridge
a
warning
was
given
them
by
some
secret
friend
that
the
advertisements
were
up
and
the
bridge
was
guarded
by
police
officers
quick
as
lightning
the
plans
were
formed
in
her
ready
brain
and
the
terrified
party
were
separated
and
hidden
in
the
houses
of
different
friends
till
her
arrangements
for
their
further
journey
were
completed
there
was
at
that
time
residing
in
wilmington
an
old
quaker
whom
i
may
call
friend
for
though
i
never
saw
his
face
i
have
had
correspondence
with
him
in
reference
to
harriet
and
her
followers
this
man
whose
name
was
thomas
garrett
and
who
was
well
known
in
those
days
to
the
friends
of
the
slave
was
a
man
of
a
wonderfully
large
and
generous
heart
through
whose
hands
during
those
days
of
distress
and
horror
no
less
than
three
thousand
men
women
and
children
passed
on
their
way
to
freedom
he
gave
heart
hand
and
means
to
aid
these
poor
fugitives
and
to
our
brave
harriet
he
often
rendered
most
efficient
help
in
her
journeys
back
and
forth
he
was
the
proprietor
of
a
very
large
shoe
establishment
and
not
one
of
these
poor
travelers
aver
left
his
house
without
a
present
of
a
new
pair
of
shoes
and
other
needed
help
no
sooner
had
this
good
man
received
intelligence
of
the
condition
of
these
poor
creatures
than
he
devised
a
plan
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
the
officers
in
pursuit
and
bring
harriet
and
her
party
across
the
bridge
two
wagons
filled
with
bricklayers
were
engaged
and
sent
over
this
was
a
common
sight
there
and
caused
no
remark
they
went
across
the
bridge
singing
and
shouting
and
it
was
not
an
unexpected
thing
that
they
should
return
as
they
went
after
nightfall
and
fortunately
the
night
was
very
dark
the
same
wagons
recrossed
the
bridge
but
with
an
addition
to
their
party
the
fugitives
were
lying
close
together
on
the
bottom
of
the
wagons
the
bricklayers
were
on
the
seats
still
singing
and
shouting
and
so
they
passed
the
guards
who
were
all
unsuspicious
of
the
nature
of
the
load
contained
in
the
wagons
or
of
the
amount
of
property
thus
escaping
their
hands
the
good
man
thomas
garrett
who
was
in
a
very
feeble
state
of
health
when
he
last
wrote
me
and
has
now
gone
to
his
reward
supplied
them
with
all
needed
comforts
and
sent
them
on
their
way
refreshed
and
with
renewed
courage
and
harriet
here
set
up
her
ebenezer
saying
thus
far
hath
the
lord
helped
me
but
many
a
danger
and
many
a
fright
and
many
a
deliverance
awaited
them
before
they
reached
the
city
of
new
york
and
even
there
they
were
not
safe
for
the
fugitive
slave
law
was
in
operation
and
their
only
refuge
was
canada
which
was
now
their
promised
land
they
finally
reached
new
york
in
safety
and
this
goes
almost
without
saying
for
i
may
as
well
mention
here
that
of
the
three
hundred
and
more
fugitives
whom
harriet
piloted
from
slavery
not
one
was
ever
recaptured
though
all
the
cunning
and
skill
of
white
men
backed
by
offered
rewards
of
large
sums
of
money
were
brought
into
requisition
for
their
recovery
as
they
entered
the
office
in
new
york
oliver
johnson
rose
up
and
exclaimed
well
joe
i
am
glad
to
see
the
man
who
is
worth
to
his
master
at
this
joe
heart
sank
oh
how
did
you
know
me
he
panted
here
is
the
advertisement
in
our
office
said
johnson
and
the
description
is
so
close
that
no
one
could
mistake
it
and
had
he
come
through
all
these
perils
had
he
traveled
by
day
and
night
and
suffered
cold
and
hunger
and
lived
in
constant
fear
and
dread
to
find
that
far
off
here
in
new
york
state
he
was
recognized
at
once
by
the
advertisement
how
then
was
he
ever
to
reach
canada
and
how
far
off
is
canada
he
asked
he
was
shown
the
map
of
new
york
state
and
the
track
of
the
railroad
for
more
than
three
hundred
miles
to
niagara
where
he
would
cross
the
river
and
be
free
but
the
way
seemed
long
and
full
of
dangers
they
were
surely
safer
on
their
own
tired
feet
where
they
might
hide
in
forests
and
ditches
and
take
refuge
in
the
friendly
underground
stations
but
here
where
this
large
party
would
be
together
in
the
cars
surely
suspicion
would
fall
upon
them
and
they
would
be
seized
and
carried
back
but
harriet
encouraged
him
in
her
cheery
way
he
must
not
give
up
now
de
lord
had
been
with
them
in
six
troubles
and
he
would
not
desert
them
in
de
seventh
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
go
on
as
moses
spoke
to
the
children
of
israel
when
compassed
before
and
behind
by
dangers
so
she
spake
to
her
people
that
they
should
go
forward
up
to
this
time
as
they
traveled
they
had
talked
and
sung
hymns
together
like
pilgrim
and
his
friends
and
joe
voice
was
the
loudest
and
sweetest
among
them
but
now
he
hanged
his
harp
upon
the
willows
and
could
sing
the
lord
songs
no
more
from
dat
time
in
harriet
language
joe
was
silent
he
talked
no
more
he
sang
no
more
he
sat
wid
his
head
on
his
hand
nobody
could
him
nor
make
him
take
any
intrust
in
anything
they
passed
along
in
safety
through
new
york
state
and
at
length
found
themselves
approaching
the
suspension
bridge
they
could
see
the
promised
land
on
the
other
side
the
uninviting
plains
of
canada
seemed
to
them
sweet
fields
beyond
the
swelling
flood
all
dressed
in
living
green
but
they
were
not
safe
yet
until
they
reached
the
center
of
the
bridge
they
were
still
in
the
power
of
their
pursuers
who
might
at
any
pause
enter
the
car
and
armed
with
the
power
of
the
law
drag
them
back
to
slavery
the
rest
of
the
party
were
happy
and
excited
they
were
simple
ignorant
creatures
and
having
implicit
trust
in
their
leader
they
felt
safe
when
with
her
and
no
immediate
danger
threatened
them
but
joe
was
of
a
different
mould
he
sat
silent
and
sad
always
thinking
of
the
horrors
that
awaited
him
if
recaptured
as
it
happened
all
the
other
passengers
were
people
who
sympathized
with
them
understanding
them
to
be
a
band
of
fugitives
and
they
listened
with
tears
as
harriet
and
all
except
poor
joe
lifted
up
their
voices
and
sang
i
on
the
way
to
canada
that
cold
and
dreary
land
de
sad
effects
of
slavery
i
ca
no
longer
stand
i
served
my
master
all
my
days
widout
a
dime
reward
and
now
i
forced
to
run
away
to
flee
de
lash
abroad
farewell
ole
master
do
think
hard
of
me
i
traveling
on
to
canada
where
all
de
slaves
are
free
de
hounds
are
baying
on
my
track
ole
master

behind
resolved
that
he
will
bring
me
back
before
i
cross
the
line
i
now
embarked
for
yonder
shore
where
a
man
by
law
de
iron
horse
will
bear
me
to
shake
de
lion
paw
oh
righteous
father
wilt
thou
not
pity
me
and
help
me
on
to
canada
where
all
de
slaves

i
heard
queen
victoria
say
that
if
we
would
forsake
our
native
land
of
slavery
and
come
across
de
lake
dat
she
was
standing
on
de
shore
wid
arms
extended
wide
to
give
us
all
a
peaceful
home
beyond
de
rolling
tide
farewell
ole
master
do
think
hard
of
me
i
traveling
on
to
canada
where
all
de
slaves
are
free
no
doubt
the
simple
creatures
with
her
expected
to
cross
a
wide
lake
instead
of
a
rapid
river
and
to
see
queen
victoria
with
her
crown
upon
her
head
waiting
with
arms
extended
wide
to
fold
them
all
in
her
embrace
there
was
now
but
one
wide
river
to
cross
and
the
cars
rolled
on
to
the
bridge
in
the
distance
was
heard
the
roar
of
the
mighty
cataract
and
now
as
they
neared
the
center
of
the
bridge
the
falls
might
be
clearly
seen
harriet
was
anxious
to
have
her
companions
see
this
wonderful
sight
and
succeeded
in
bringing
all
to
the
windows
except
joe
but
joe
still
sat
with
his
head
on
his
hands
and
not
even
the
wonders
of
niagara
could
draw
him
from
his
melancholy
musings
at
length
as
harriet
knew
by
the
rise
of
the
center
of
the
bridge
and
the
descent
immediately
after
the
line
of
danger
was
passed
she
sprang
across
to
joe
side
of
the
car
and
shook
him
almost
out
of
his
seat
as
she
shouted
joe
you
shook
de
lion
paw
this
was
her
phrase
for
having
entered
on
the
dominions
of
england
but
joe
did
not
understand
this
figurative
expression
then
she
shook
him
again
and
put
it
more
plainly
joe
you
in
queen
victoria
dominions
you
a
free
man
then
joe
arose
his
head
went
up
he
raised
his
hands
on
high
and
his
eyes
streaming
with
tears
to
heaven
and
then
he
began
to
sing
and
shout
glory
to
god
and
jesus
too
one
more
soul
got
safe
oh
go
and
carry
the
news
one
more
soul
got
safe
joe
come
and
look
at
the
falls
glory
to
god
and
jesus
too
one
more
soul
got
safe
joe
it
your
last
chance
come
and
see
de
falls
glory
to
god
and
jesus
too
one
more
soul
got
safe
and
this
was
all
the
answer
the
train
stopped
on
the
other
side
and
the
first
feet
to
touch
british
soil
after
those
of
the
conductor
were
those
of
poor
joe
loud
roared
the
waters
of
niagara
but
louder
still
ascended
the
anthem
of
praise
from
the
overflowing
heart
of
the
freeman
and
can
we
doubt
that
the
strain
was
taken
up
by
angel
voices
and
echoed
and
through
the
vaults
of
heaven
glory
to
god
in
the
highest
glory
to
god
and
jesus
too
for
all
these
souls
now
safe
the
white
ladies
and
gentlemen
gathered
round
him
said
harriet
till
i
could
see
joe
for
the
crowd
only
i
heard
his
voice
singing
to
god
and
jesus
too
louder
than
ever
a
sweet
young
lady
reached
over
her
fine
cambric
handkerchief
to
him
and
as
joe
wiped
the
great
tears
off
his
face
he
said
tank
de
lord
dere
only
one
more
journey
for
me
now
and
dat
to
hebben
as
we
bid
farewell
to
joe
here
i
may
as
well
say
that
harriet
saw
him
several
times
after
that
a
happy
and
industrious
freeman
in
canada
b
footnote
b
in
my
recent
interview
with
oliver
johnson
he
told
me
of
an
interesting
incident
in
the
life
of
the
good
man
thomas
garrett
he
was
tried
twice
for
assisting
in
the
escape
of
fugitive
slaves
and
was
fined
so
heavily
that
everything
he
possessed
was
taken
from
him
and
sold
to
pay
the
fine
at
the
age
of
sixty
he
was
left
without
a
penny
but
he
went
bravely
to
work
and
in
some
measure
regained
his
fortune
all
the
time
aiding
in
every
way
possible
all
stray
fugitives
who
applied
to
him
for
help
again
he
was
arrested
tried
and
heavily
fined
and
as
the
judge
of
the
united
states
court
pronounced
the
sentence
he
said
in
a
solemn
manner
garrett
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
not
to
interfere
hereafter
with
the
cause
of
justice
by
helping
off
runaway
negroes
the
old
man
who
had
stood
to
receive
his
sentence
here
raised
his
head
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
court
he
said
judge
thee
has
left
me
a
dollar
but
i
wish
to
say
to
thee
and
to
all
in
this
court
room
that
if
anyone
knows
of
a
fugitive
who
wants
a
shelter
and
a
friend
him
to
thomas
and
he
will
befriend
him
not
luther
before
the
council
at
worms
was
grander
than
this
brave
old
man
in
his
unswerving
adherence
to
principle
in
those
days
that
tried
men
souls
there
were
many
men
like
this
old
quaker
and
many
women
too
who
would
have
gone
cheerfully
to
the
fire
and
the
stake
for
the
cause
of
suffering
humanity
men
and
women
of
whom
the
world
was
not
worthy
on
one
of
her
journeys
to
the
north
as
she
was
piloting
a
company
of
refugees
harriet
came
just
as
morning
broke
to
a
town
where
a
colored
man
had
lived
whose
house
had
been
one
of
her
stations
of
the
or
unseen
railroad
they
reached
the
house
and
leaving
her
party
huddled
together
in
the
middle
of
the
street
in
a
pouring
rain
harriet
went
to
the
door
and
gave
the
peculiar
rap
which
was
her
customary
signal
to
her
friends
there
was
not
the
usual
ready
response
and
she
was
obliged
to
repeat
the
signal
several
times
at
length
a
window
was
raised
and
the
head
of
a
appeared
with
the
gruff
question
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
harriet
asked
after
her
friend
and
was
told
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
leave
for
harboring
niggers
here
was
an
unforeseen
trouble
day
was
breaking
and
daylight
was
the
enemy
of
the
hunted
and
flying
fugitives
their
faithful
leader
stood
one
moment
in
the
street
and
in
that
moment
she
had
flashed
a
message
quicker
than
that
of
the
telegraph
to
her
unseen
protector
and
the
answer
came
as
quickly
in
a
suggestion
to
her
of
an
almost
forgotten
place
of
refuge
outside
of
the
town
there
was
a
little
island
in
a
swamp
where
the
grass
grew
tall
and
rank
and
where
no
human
being
could
be
suspected
of
seeking
a
hiding
place
to
this
spot
she
conducted
her
party
she
waded
the
swamp
carrying
in
a
basket
two
babies
these
were
a
pair
of
little
twins
whom
i
have
since
seen
well
grown
young
women
and
the
rest
of
the
company
following
she
ordered
them
to
lie
down
in
the
tall
wet
grass
and
here
she
prayed
again
and
waited
for
deliverance
the
poor
creatures
were
all
cold
and
wet
and
hungry
and
harriet
did
not
dare
to
leave
them
to
get
supplies
for
no
doubt
the
man
at
whose
house
she
had
knocked
had
given
the
alarm
in
the
town
and
officers
might
be
on
the
watch
for
them
they
were
truly
in
a
wretched
condition
but
faith
never
wavered
her
silent
prayer
still
ascended
and
she
confidently
expected
help
from
some
quarter
or
other
it
was
after
dusk
when
a
man
came
slowly
walking
along
the
solid
pathway
on
the
edge
of
the
swamp
he
was
clad
in
the
garb
of
a
quaker
and
proved
to
be
a
friend
in
need
and
indeed
he
seemed
to
be
talking
to
himself
but
ears
quickened
by
sharp
practice
caught
the
words
he
was
saying
my
wagon
stands
in
the
of
the
next
farm
across
the
way
the
horse
is
in
the
stable
the
harness
hangs
on
a
nail
and
the
man
was
gone
night
fell
and
harriet
stole
forth
to
the
place
designated
not
only
a
wagon
but
a
wagon
well
provisioned
stood
in
the
yard
and
before
many
minutes
the
party
were
rescued
from
their
wretched
position
and
were
on
their
way
rejoicing
to
the
next
town
here
dwelt
a
quaker
whom
harriet
knew
and
he
readily
took
charge
of
the
horse
and
wagon
and
no
doubt
returned
them
to
their
owner
how
the
good
man
who
thus
came
to
their
rescue
had
received
any
intimation
of
their
being
in
the
neighborhood
harriet
never
knew
but
these
sudden
deliverances
never
seemed
to
strike
her
as
at
all
strange
or
mysterious
her
prayer
was
the
prayer
of
faith
and
she
an
answer
at
one
time
as
she
was
on
her
way
south
for
a
party
of
slaves
she
was
stopped
not
far
from
the
southern
shore
of
the
chesapeake
bay
by
a
young
woman
who
had
been
for
some
days
in
hiding
and
was
anxiously
watching
for
moses
who
was
soon
expected
to
pass
that
way
this
girl
was
a
young
and
pretty
mulatto
named
tilly
she
had
been
lady
maid
and
dressmaker
for
her
mistress
she
was
engaged
to
a
young
man
from
another
plantation
but
he
had
joined
one
of
harriet
parties
and
gone
north
tilly
was
to
have
gone
also
at
that
time
but
had
found
it
impossible
to
get
away
now
she
had
learned
that
it
was
her
master
intention
to
give
her
to
a
negro
of
his
own
for
his
wife
and
in
fear
and
desperation
she
made
a
strike
for
freedom
friends
had
concealed
her
and
all
had
been
on
the
watch
for
moses
the
distress
and
excitement
of
the
poor
creature
was
so
great
and
she
begged
and
implored
in
such
agonized
tones
that
harriet
would
just
see
her
safe
to
baltimore
where
she
knew
of
friends
who
would
harbor
her
and
help
her
on
her
way
that
harriet
determined
to
turn
about
and
endeavor
to
take
the
poor
girl
thus
far
on
her
northward
journey
they
reached
the
shore
of
chesapeake
bay
too
late
to
leave
that
night
and
were
obliged
to
hide
for
a
night
and
day
in
the
loft
of
an
old
where
every
sound
caused
poor
tilly
to
tremble
as
if
she
had
an
ague
fit
when
the
time
for
the
boat
to
leave
arrived
a
sad
disappointment
awaited
them
the
boat
on
which
they
had
expected
to
leave
was
disabled
and
another
boat
was
to
take
its
place
at
that
time
according
to
the
law
of
slavery
no
negro
could
leave
his
master
land
or
travel
anywhere
without
a
pass
properly
signed
by
his
owner
of
course
this
poor
fugitive
had
no
pass
and
harriet
passes
were
her
own
wits
but
among
her
many
friends
there
was
one
who
seemed
to
have
influence
with
the
clerk
of
the
boat
on
which
she
expected
to
take
passage
and
she
was
the
bearer
of
a
note
requesting
or
commanding
him
to
take
these
two
women
to
the
end
of
his
route
asking
no
questions
now
here
was
an
unforeseen
difficulty
the
boat
was
not
going
the
clerk
was
not
there
all
on
the
other
boat
were
strangers
but
forward
they
must
go
trusting
in
providence
as
they
walked
down
to
the
boat
a
gang
of
lazy
white
men
standing
together
began
to
make
comments
on
their
appearance
too
many
likely
looking
niggers
traveling
north
about
these
days
wonder
if
these
wenches
have
got
a
pass
where
you
going
you
two
tilly
trembled
and
cowered
and
clung
to
her
protector
but
harriet
put
on
a
bold
front
and
holding
the
note
given
her
by
her
friend
in
her
hand
and
supporting
her
terrified
charge
she
walked
by
the
men
taking
no
notice
of
their
insults
they
joined
the
stream
of
people
going
up
to
get
their
tickets
but
when
harriet
asked
for
hers
the
clerk
eyed
her
suspiciously
and
said
you
just
stand
aside
you
two
i
attend
to
your
case
bye
and
bye
harriet
led
the
young
girl
to
the
bow
of
the
boat
where
they
were
alone
and
here
having
no
other
help
she
as
was
her
custom
addressed
herself
to
the
lord
kneeling
on
the
seat
and
supporting
her
head
on
her
hands
and
fixing
her
eyes
on
the
waters
of
the
bay
she
groaned
oh
lord
you
been
wid
me
in
six
troubles
desert
me
in
the
seventh
moses
moses
cried
tilly
pulling
her
by
the
sleeve
do
go
and
see
if
you
ca
get
tickets
now
oh
lord
you
been
wid
me
in
six
troubles
desert
me
in
the
seventh
and
so
harriet
story
goes
on
in
her
peculiarly
graphic
manner
till
at
length
in
terror
tilly
exclaimed
oh
moses
the
man
is
coming
what
shall
we
do
oh
lord
you
been
wid
me
in
six
troubles
here
the
clerk
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
and
tilly
thought
their
time
had
come
but
all
he
said
was
you
can
come
now
and
get
your
tickets
and
their
troubles
were
over
what
changed
this
man
from
his
former
suspicious
and
antagonistic
aspect
harriet
never
knew
of
course
she
said
it
was
de
lord
but
as
to
the
agency
he
used
she
never
troubled
herself
to
inquire
she
deliverance
when
she
prayed
unless
the
lord
had
ordered
otherwise
and
in
that
case
she
was
perfectly
willing
to
accept
the
divine
decree
when
surprise
was
expressed
at
her
courage
and
daring
or
at
her
unexpected
deliverances
she
would
always
reply
do
i
tell
you
missus
was
jes
so
long
as
he
wanted
to
use
me
he
would
take
keer
of
me
an
when
he
want
me
no
longer
i
was
ready
to
go
i
always
tole
him
i
gwine
to
hole
stiddy
on
to
you
an
you
got
to
see
me
trou
there
came
a
time
when
harriet
who
had
already
brought
away
as
many
of
her
family
as
she
could
reach
besides
all
others
who
would
trust
themselves
to
her
care
became
much
troubled
in
spirit
about
three
of
her
brothers
having
had
an
intimation
of
some
kind
that
danger
was
impending
over
them
with
her
usual
wonderful
cunning
she
employed
a
friend
to
write
a
letter
for
her
to
a
man
named
jacob
jackson
who
lived
near
the
plantation
where
these
brothers
were
at
that
time
the
hired
slaves
jacob
jackson
was
a
free
negro
who
could
both
read
and
write
and
who
was
under
suspicion
just
then
of
having
a
hand
in
the
disappearance
of
colored
property
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
exercise
great
caution
in
writing
to
him
on
his
own
account
as
well
as
that
of
the
writer
and
those
whom
she
wished
to
aid
jacob
had
an
adopted
son
william
henry
jackson
also
free
who
had
come
north
harriet
determined
to
sign
her
letter
with
william
henry
name
feeling
sure
that
jacob
would
be
clever
enough
to
understand
by
her
peculiar
phraseology
the
meaning
she
intended
to
convey
therefore
after
speaking
of
indifferent
matters
the
letter
went
on
read
my
letter
to
the
old
folks
and
give
my
love
to
them
and
tell
my
brothers
to
be
always
unto
and
when
good
old
ship
of
zion
comes
along
to
be
ready
to
step
on
this
letter
was
signed
william
henry
jackson
jacob
was
not
allowed
to
have
his
letters
in
those
days
until
the
inspectors
of
correspondence
had
had
the
perusal
of
them
and
consulted
over
their
secret
meaning
these
therefore
assembled
wiped
their
glasses
carefully
put
them
on
and
proceeded
to
examine
this
suspicious
document
what
it
meant
they
could
not
imagine
william
henry
jackson
had
no
parents
or
brothers
and
the
letter
was
incomprehensible
study
as
they
might
no
light
dawned
upon
them
but
their
suspicions
became
stronger
and
they
were
sure
the
letter
meant
mischief
white
genius
having
exhausted
itself
black
genius
was
brought
into
requisition
jacob
was
sent
for
and
the
letter
was
placed
in
his
hands
he
read
between
the
lines
and
comprehended
the
hidden
meaning
at
once
moses
had
dictated
this
letter
and
moses
was
coming
the
brothers
must
be
on
the
watch
and
ready
to
join
her
at
a
moment
warning
but
moses
must
hurry
for
the
word
had
gone
forth
that
the
brothers
were
to
be
sent
south
and
the
was
being
collected
jacob
read
the
letter
slowly
threw
it
down
and
said
dat
letter
ca
be
meant
for
me
no
how
i
ca
make
head
or
tail
of
it
and
he
walked
off
and
took
immediate
measures
to
let
brothers
know
that
she
was
on
the
way
and
they
must
be
ready
at
the
given
signal
to
start
for
the
north
it
was
the
day
before
christmas
when
harriet
arrived
and
the
brothers
were
to
have
started
on
the
day
after
christmas
for
the
south
they
started
on
but
with
their
faces
turned
in
another
direction
and
instead
of
the
and
the
whip
they
had
the
north
star
for
their
guide
and
the
moses
of
her
people
for
their
leader
as
usual
this
mysterious
woman
appeared
suddenly
and
word
was
conveyed
to
the
brothers
that
they
were
to
be
at
old
ben
cabin
on
saturday
night
ready
to
start
old
ben
was
their
father
and
as
the
parents
were
not
of
much
use
now
harriet
was
pretty
certain
that
they
would
not
be
sent
away
and
so
she
left
them
till
she
had
rescued
the
younger
and
more
valuable
members
of
the
family
quite
a
number
had
assembled
at
the
cabin
when
the
hour
came
for
starting
but
one
brother
was
missing
something
had
detained
john
but
when
the
time
for
starting
had
struck
harriet
word
was
forward
and
she
nebber
waited
for
no
one
poor
john
was
ready
to
start
from
his
cabin
in
the
negro
quarter
when
his
wife
was
taken
ill
and
in
an
hour
or
two
another
little
heir
to
the
blessings
of
slavery
had
come
into
the
world
john
must
go
off
for
a
granny
and
being
a
faithful
affectionate
creature
he
could
not
leave
his
wife
under
the
present
circumstances
after
the
birth
of
the
child
he
determined
to
start
the
north
and
freedom
or
the
south
and
slavery
were
the
alternatives
before
him
and
this
was
his
last
chance
if
he
once
reached
the
north
he
hoped
with
the
help
of
moses
to
bring
his
wife
and
children
there
again
and
again
he
tried
to
start
out
of
the
door
but
a
watchful
eye
was
on
him
and
he
was
always
arrested
by
the
question
where
you
gwine
john
his
wife
had
not
been
informed
of
the
danger
hanging
over
his
head
but
she
knew
he
was
uneasy
and
she
feared
he
was
meditating
a
plan
of
escape
john
told
her
he
was
going
to
try
to
get
hired
out
on
christmas
to
another
man
as
that
was
the
day
on
which
such
changes
were
made
he
left
the
house
but
stood
near
the
window
listening
he
heard
his
wife
sobbing
and
moaning
and
not
being
able
to
endure
it
he
went
back
to
her
oh
john
she
cried
you
gwine
to
lebe
me
i
know
it
but
wherebber
you
go
john
do
forgit
me
an
de
little
children
john
assured
her
that
wherever
he
went
she
should
come
he
might
not
come
for
her
but
he
would
send
moses
and
then
he
hurried
away
he
had
many
miles
to
walk
to
his
old
father
cabin
where
he
knew
the
others
would
be
waiting
for
him
and
at
daybreak
he
overtook
them
in
the
fodder
house
not
far
from
the
home
of
the
old
people
at
that
time
harriet
had
not
seen
her
mother
for
six
years
but
she
did
not
dare
to
let
her
know
that
four
of
her
children
were
so
near
her
on
their
way
to
the
north
for
she
would
have
raised
such
an
uproar
in
her
efforts
to
detain
them
that
the
whole
neighborhood
would
have
been
aroused
the
poor
old
woman
had
been
expecting
her
sons
to
spend
christmas
with
her
as
usual
she
had
been
hard
at
work
in
preparation
for
their
arrival
the
fatted
pig
had
been
killed
and
had
been
converted
into
every
form
possible
to
the
flesh
of
swine
pork
bacon
and
sausages
were
ready
but
the
boys
did
not
come
and
there
she
sat
watching
and
waiting
in
the
night
when
harriet
with
two
of
her
brothers
and
two
other
fugitives
who
had
joined
them
arrived
at
the
fodder
house
they
were
exhausted
and
famished
they
sent
the
two
strange
men
up
to
the
cabin
to
try
to
rouse
old
ben
but
not
to
let
their
mother
know
that
her
children
were
so
near
her
the
men
succeeded
in
rousing
old
ben
who
came
out
quietly
and
as
soon
as
he
heard
their
story
went
back
into
the
house
gathered
together
a
quantity
of
provisions
and
came
down
to
the
fodder
house
he
placed
the
provisions
inside
the
door
saying
a
few
words
of
welcome
to
his
children
but
taking
care
to
see
i
know
what
come
of
dis
he
said
an
i
ai
gwine
to
see
my
chillen
no
how
the
close
espionage
under
which
these
poor
creatures
dwelt
engendered
in
them
a
cunning
and
artifice
which
to
them
seemed
only
a
fair
and
right
attempt
on
their
part
to
cope
with
power
and
cruelty
constantly
in
force
against
them
up
among
the
ears
of
corn
lay
the
old
man
children
and
one
of
them
he
had
not
seen
for
six
years
it
rained
in
torrents
all
that
sunday
and
there
they
lay
among
the
corn
for
they
could
not
start
till
night
at
about
daybreak
john
had
joined
them
there
were
wide
chinks
in
the
boards
of
the
fodder
house
and
through
these
they
could
see
the
cabin
of
the
old
folks
now
quite
alone
in
their
old
age
all
day
long
every
few
minutes
they
would
see
the
old
woman
come
out
and
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
take
a
long
look
down
the
road
to
see
if
de
boys
were
coming
and
then
with
a
sad
and
disappointed
air
she
would
turn
back
into
the
cabin
and
they
could
almost
hear
her
sigh
as
she
did
so
what
had
become
of
the
boys
had
they
been
sold
off
down
south
had
they
tried
to
escape
and
been
retaken
would
she
never
see
them
or
hear
of
them
more
i
have
often
heard
it
said
by
southern
people
that
niggers
had
no
feeling
they
did
not
care
when
their
children
were
taken
from
them
i
have
seen
enough
of
them
to
know
that
their
love
for
their
offspring
is
quite
equal
to
that
of
the
superior
race
and
it
is
enough
to
hear
the
tale
of
harriet
endurance
and
to
rescue
her
brothers
and
sisters
to
convince
one
that
a
heart
truer
and
more
loving
than
that
of
many
a
white
woman
dwelt
in
her
bosom
i
am
quite
willing
to
acknowledge
that
she
was
almost
an
anomaly
among
her
people
but
i
have
known
many
of
her
family
and
so
far
as
i
can
judge
they
all
seem
to
be
peculiarly
intelligent
upright
and
religious
people
and
to
have
a
strong
feeling
of
family
affection
there
may
be
many
among
the
colored
race
like
them
certainly
all
should
not
be
judged
by
the
idle
miserable
darkies
who
have
swarmed
about
washington
and
other
cities
since
the
war
two
or
three
times
while
the
group
of
fugitives
were
concealed
in
this
loft
of
the
fodder
house
the
old
man
came
down
and
pushed
food
inside
the
door
and
after
nightfall
he
came
again
to
accompany
his
children
as
far
as
he
dared
upon
their
journey
when
he
reached
the
fodder
house
he
tied
a
handkerchief
tight
about
his
eyes
and
one
of
his
sons
taking
him
by
one
arm
and
harriet
taking
him
by
the
other
they
went
on
their
way
talking
in
low
tones
together
asking
and
answering
questions
as
to
relatives
and
friends
the
time
of
parting
came
and
they
bade
him
farewell
and
left
him
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
when
he
could
no
longer
hear
their
footsteps
he
turned
back
and
taking
the
handkerchief
from
his
eyes
he
hastened
home
but
before
harriet
and
her
brothers
left
they
had
gone
up
to
the
cabin
during
the
evening
to
take
a
silent
farewell
of
the
poor
old
mother
through
the
little
window
of
the
cabin
they
saw
her
sitting
by
the
fire
her
head
on
her
hand
rocking
back
and
forth
as
was
her
way
when
she
was
in
great
trouble
praying
no
doubt
and
wondering
what
had
become
of
her
children
and
what
new
evil
had
befallen
them
with
streaming
eyes
they
watched
her
for
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
but
time
was
precious
and
they
must
reach
their
next
station
before
daylight
and
so
they
turned
sadly
away
when
christmas
was
over
and
the
men
had
not
returned
there
began
to
be
no
small
stir
in
the
plantation
from
which
they
had
escaped
the
first
place
to
search
of
course
was
the
home
of
the
old
people
at
the
big
house
nothing
had
been
seen
of
them
the
master
said
they
had
generally
come
up
there
to
see
the
house
servants
when
they
came
for
christmas
but
this
time
they
been
round
at
all
better
go
down
to
old
ben
and
ask
him
they
went
to
old
ben
no
one
was
at
home
but
old
kit
the
mother
she
said
not
one
of
came
dis
christmas
she
was
looking
for
all
day
an
her
heart
was
mos
broke
about
old
ben
was
found
and
questioned
about
his
sons
old
ben
said
he
had
of
dis
christmas
with
all
his
deep
religious
feeling
old
ben
thought
that
in
such
a
case
as
this
it
was
enough
for
him
to
keep
to
the
and
let
the
man
hunters
find
his
sons
if
they
could
old
ben
knew
the
old
testament
stories
well
perhaps
he
thought
of
rahab
who
hid
the
spies
and
received
a
commendation
for
it
perhaps
of
jacob
and
abraham
and
some
of
their
rather
questionable
proceedings
he
knew
the
new
testament
also
but
i
think
perhaps
he
thought
the
kind
and
loving
saviour
would
have
said
to
him
neither
do
i
condemn
thee
i
doubt
if
he
had
read
opie
and
i
wonder
what
judgment
that
excellent
woman
would
have
given
in
a
case
like
this
these
poor
fugitives
hunted
like
partridges
upon
the
mountains
or
like
the
timid
fox
by
the
eager
sportsman
were
obliged
in
to
meet
cunning
with
cunning
and
to
borrow
from
the
birds
and
animals
their
mode
of
eluding
their
pursuers
by
any
device
which
in
the
exigency
of
the
case
might
present
itself
to
them
they
had
a
creed
of
their
own
and
a
code
of
morals
which
we
dare
not
criticise
till
we
find
our
own
lives
and
those
of
our
dear
ones
similarly
imperiled
one
of
harriet
other
brothers
had
long
been
attached
to
a
pretty
mulatto
girl
named
catherine
who
was
owned
by
another
master
but
this
man
had
other
views
for
her
and
would
not
let
her
marry
william
henry
on
one
of
harriet
journeys
this
brother
had
made
up
his
mind
to
make
one
of
her
next
party
to
the
north
and
that
catherine
should
go
also
he
went
to
a
tailor
and
bought
a
new
suit
of
clothes
for
a
small
person
and
concealed
them
inside
the
fence
of
the
garden
of
catherine
master
this
garden
ran
down
to
the
bank
of
a
little
stream
and
catherine
had
been
notified
where
to
find
the
clothes
when
the
time
came
to
get
ready
catherine
boldly
walked
down
to
the
foot
of
the
garden
took
up
the
bundle
and
hiding
under
the
bank
she
put
on
the
man
garments
and
sent
her
own
floating
down
the
stream
she
was
soon
missed
and
all
the
girls
in
the
house
were
set
to
looking
for
catherine
presently
they
saw
coming
up
from
the
river
a
little
darkey
boy
and
they
all
ceased
looking
for
catherine
and
stared
at
him
he
walked
directly
by
them
round
the
house
and
out
of
the
gate
without
the
slightest
suspicion
being
excited
as
to
who
he
was
in
a
few
weeks
from
that
time
this
party
were
all
safe
in
canada
william
henry
died
in
canada
but
i
have
seen
and
talked
with
catherine
at
harriet
house
i
am
not
quite
certain
which
company
it
was
that
was
under
her
guidance
on
their
northward
way
but
at
one
time
when
a
number
of
men
were
following
her
she
received
one
of
her
sudden
intimations
that
danger
was
ahead
chillen
she
said
we
must
stop
here
and
cross
dis
ribber
they
were
on
the
bank
of
a
stream
of
some
width
and
apparently
a
deep
and
rapid
one
the
men
were
afraid
to
cross
there
was
no
bridge
and
no
boat
but
like
her
great
pattern
she
went
forward
into
the
waters
and
the
men
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
followed
but
with
fear
and
trembling
the
stream
did
not
divide
to
make
a
way
for
them
to
cross
over
but
to
her
was
literally
fulfilled
the
promise
when
through
the
deep
waters
i
cause
thee
to
go
the
rivers
of
sorrow
shall
not
overflow
for
said
she
missus
de
water
never
came
above
my
chin
when
we
thought
surely
we
were
all
going
under
it
became
shallower
and
shallower
and
we
came
out
safe
on
the
odder
side
then
there
was
another
stream
to
cross
which
was
also
passed
in
safety
they
found
afterward
that
a
few
rods
ahead
of
them
the
advertisement
of
these
escaping
fugitives
was
posted
up
and
the
officers
forewarned
of
their
coming
were
waiting
for
them
but
though
the
lord
thus
marvelously
protected
her
from
capture
she
did
not
always
escape
the
consequences
of
exposure
like
this
it
was
in
march
that
this
passage
of
the
streams
was
effected
and
the
weather
was
raw
and
cold
harriet
traveled
a
long
distance
in
her
wet
clothing
and
was
afterward
very
ill
for
a
long
time
with
a
very
severe
cold
i
have
often
heard
her
tell
this
story
but
some
of
the
incidents
particularly
that
of
her
illness
were
not
mentioned
by
herself
but
were
written
me
by
friend
garrett
i
hardly
know
how
to
approach
the
subject
of
the
spiritual
experiences
of
my
sable
heroine
they
seem
so
to
enter
into
the
realm
of
the
supernatural
that
i
can
hardly
wonder
that
those
who
never
knew
her
are
ready
to
throw
discredit
upon
the
story
ridicule
has
been
cast
upon
the
whole
tale
of
her
adventures
by
the
advocates
of
human
slavery
and
perhaps
by
those
who
would
tell
with
countenance
some
tale
of
ghostly
visitation
or
spiritual
manifestation
at
a
dimly
lighted
had
i
not
known
so
well
her
deeply
religious
character
and
her
conscientious
veracity
and
had
i
not
since
the
war
and
when
she
was
an
inmate
of
my
own
house
seen
such
remarkable
instances
of
what
seemed
to
be
her
direct
intercourse
with
heaven
i
should
not
dare
to
risk
my
own
character
for
veracity
by
making
these
things
public
in
this
manner
but
when
i
add
that
i
have
the
strongest
testimonials
to
her
character
for
integrity
from
william
seward
gerritt
smith
wendell
phillips
fred
douglass
and
my
brother
hopkins
who
has
known
her
for
many
years
i
do
not
fear
to
brave
the
incredulity
of
any
reader
governor
seward
wrote
of
her
i
have
known
harriet
long
and
a
nobler
higher
spirit
or
a
truer
seldom
dwells
in
human
form
gerritt
smith
the
distinguished
philanthropist
was
so
kind
as
to
write
me
expressing
his
gratification
that
i
had
undertaken
this
work
and
added
i
have
often
listened
to
harriet
with
delight
on
her
visits
to
my
family
and
i
am
convinced
that
she
is
not
only
truthful
but
that
she
has
a
rare
discernment
and
a
deep
and
sublime
philanthropy
wendell
phillips
wrote
me
mentioning
that
in
boston
harriet
earned
the
confidence
and
admiration
of
all
those
who
were
working
for
freedom
and
speaking
of
her
labors
during
the
war
he
added
in
my
opinion
there
are
few
captains
perhaps
few
colonels
who
have
done
more
for
the
loyal
cause
since
the
war
began
and
few
men
who
did
more
before
that
time
for
the
colored
race
than
our
fearless
and
sagacious
friend
many
other
letters
i
received
from
sanborn
secretary
of
the
massachusetts
board
of
charities
from
fred
douglass
from
rev
henry
fowler
and
from
union
officers
at
the
south
during
the
war
all
speaking
in
the
highest
praise
and
admiration
of
the
character
and
labors
of
my
black
heroine
many
of
her
passes
also
were
sent
me
in
which
she
is
spoken
of
as
moses
for
by
that
name
she
was
universally
known
for
the
story
of
her
heroic
deeds
had
gone
before
her
and
the
testimony
of
all
who
knew
her
accorded
with
the
words
of
seward
the
cause
of
freedom
owes
her
much
the
country
owes
her
much
and
yet
the
country
was
not
willing
to
pay
her
anything
seward
efforts
seconded
by
other
distinguished
men
to
get
a
pension
for
her
were
sneered
at
in
congress
as
absurd
and
quixotic
and
the
effort
failed
secretary
seward
from
whom
harriet
purchased
her
little
place
near
auburn
died
the
place
had
been
mortgaged
when
this
noble
woman
left
her
home
and
threw
herself
into
the
work
needed
for
the
union
cause
the
mortgage
was
to
be
foreclosed
the
old
parents
then
nearly
approaching
their
centennial
year
were
to
be
turned
out
to
die
in
a
when
the
sudden
determination
was
taken
to
send
out
a
little
sketch
of
her
life
to
the
benevolent
public
in
the
hope
of
redeeming
the
little
home
this
object
through
the
kindness
of
friends
was
accomplished
the
old
people
died
in
harriet
own
home
breathing
blessings
upon
her
for
her
devotion
to
them
now
another
necessity
has
arisen
and
our
sable
friend
who
never
has
been
known
to
beg
for
herself
asks
once
more
for
help
in
accomplishing
a
favorite
project
for
the
good
of
her
people
this
as
she
says
is
her
last
work
and
she
only
prays
de
lord
to
let
her
live
till
it
is
well
started
and
den
she
is
ready
to
go
this
work
is
the
building
of
a
hospital
for
old
and
disabled
colored
people
and
in
this
she
has
already
had
the
sympathy
and
aid
of
the
good
people
of
auburn
the
mayor
and
his
noble
wife
having
given
her
great
assistance
in
the
meetings
she
has
held
in
aid
of
this
object
it
is
partly
to
aid
her
in
this
work
on
which
she
has
so
set
her
heart
that
this
story
of
her
life
and
labors
is
being
at
one
time
when
she
felt
called
upon
to
go
down
for
some
company
of
slaves
she
was
as
she
knew
watched
for
everywhere
for
there
had
been
an
excited
meeting
of
and
they
were
determined
to
catch
her
dead
or
alive
her
friends
gathered
round
her
imploring
her
not
to
go
on
in
the
face
of
danger
and
death
for
they
were
sure
she
would
never
be
allowed
to
return
and
this
was
her
answer
now
look
yer
john
saw
de
city
did
he
yes
john
saw
de
city
well
what
did
he
see
he
saw
twelve
gates
did
he
three
of
dose
gates
was
on
de
north
three
of
was
on
de
east
an
three
of
was
on
de
west
but
dere
was
three
more
an
dem
was
on
de
an
i
reckon
if
dey
kill
me
down
dere
git
into
one
of
dem
gates
do
you
whether
harriet
ideas
of
the
geographical
bearings
of
the
gates
of
the
celestial
city
as
seen
in
the
apocalyptic
vision
were
correct
or
not
we
can
not
doubt
that
she
was
right
in
the
deduction
her
faith
drew
from
them
and
that
somewhere
whether
north
east
south
or
west
to
our
dim
vision
there
is
a
gate
that
will
be
opened
for
our
good
harriet
where
the
welcome
will
be
given
come
in
thou
blessed
of
my
father
it
is
a
peculiarity
of
harriet
that
she
had
seldom
been
known
to
intimate
a
wish
that
anything
should
be
given
to
herself
but
when
her
people
are
in
need
no
scruples
of
delicacy
stand
in
the
way
of
her
petitions
nay
almost
her
for
help
when
after
rescuing
so
many
others
and
all
of
her
brothers
and
sisters
that
could
be
reached
with
their
children
she
received
an
intimation
in
some
mysterious
or
supernatural
way
that
the
old
people
were
in
trouble
and
needed
her
she
asked
the
lord
where
she
should
go
for
the
money
to
enable
her
to
go
for
them
she
was
in
some
way
as
she
supposed
directed
to
the
office
of
a
certain
gentleman
a
friend
of
the
slaves
in
new
york
when
she
left
the
house
of
the
friends
with
whom
she
was
staying
she
said
gwine
to
office
an
i
ai
gwine
to
lebe
dere
i
ai
gwine
to
eat
or
drink
till
i
get
money
enough
to
take
me
down
after
de
ole
people
she
went
into
this
gentleman
office
how
do
you
do
harriet
what
do
you
want
was
the
first
greeting
i
want
some
money
sir
how
much
do
you
want
i
want
twenty
dollars
sir
who
told
you
to
come
here
for
twenty
dollars
de
lord
tole
me
sir
he
did
well
i
guess
the
lord
mistaken
this
time
no
sir
de
lord
nebber
mistaken
anyhow
i
gwine
to
sit
here
till
i
get
it
so
she
sat
down
and
went
to
sleep
all
the
morning
and
all
the
afternoon
she
sat
there
still
sometimes
sleeping
sometimes
rousing
up
often
finding
the
office
full
of
gentlemen
sometimes
finding
herself
alone
many
fugitives
were
passing
through
new
york
at
this
time
and
those
who
came
in
supposed
her
to
be
one
of
them
tired
out
and
resting
sometimes
she
would
be
roused
up
with
the
words
come
harriet
you
had
better
go
there
no
money
for
you
here
no
sir
i
not
gwine
to
stir
from
here
till
i
git
my
twenty
dollars
she
does
not
know
all
that
happened
for
deep
sleep
fell
upon
her
probably
one
of
the
turns
of
somnolency
to
which
she
has
always
been
subject
but
without
doubt
her
story
was
whispered
from
one
to
another
and
as
her
name
and
exploits
were
well
known
to
many
persons
the
sympathies
of
some
of
those
visitors
to
the
office
were
aroused
at
all
events
she
came
to
full
consciousness
at
last
to
find
herself
the
happy
possessor
of
the
contribution
of
these
strangers
she
went
on
her
way
rejoicing
to
bring
her
old
parents
from
the
land
of
bondage
when
she
reached
their
home
she
found
that
her
old
father
was
to
be
tried
the
next
monday
for
helping
off
slaves
and
so
as
she
says
in
her
forcible
language
i
just
removed
my
father
trial
to
a
higher
court
and
brought
him
off
to
canada
the
manner
of
their
escape
is
detailed
in
the
following
letter
from
friend
garrett
wilmington
my
friend
thy
favor
of
the
reached
me
yesterday
requesting
such
reminiscences
as
i
could
give
respecting
the
remarkable
labors
of
harriet
tubman
in
aiding
her
colored
friends
from
bondage
i
may
begin
by
saying
living
as
i
have
in
a
slave
state
and
the
laws
being
very
severe
where
any
proof
could
be
made
of
any
one
aiding
slaves
on
their
way
to
freedom
i
have
not
felt
at
liberty
to
keep
any
written
word
of
harriet
or
my
own
labors
except
in
numbering
those
whom
i
have
aided
for
that
reason
i
can
not
furnish
so
interesting
an
account
of
harriet
labors
as
i
otherwise
could
and
now
would
be
glad
to
do
for
in
truth
i
never
met
with
any
person
of
any
color
who
had
more
confidence
in
the
voice
of
god
as
spoken
direct
to
her
soul
she
has
frequently
told
me
that
she
talked
with
god
and
he
talked
with
her
every
day
of
her
life
and
she
has
declared
to
me
that
she
felt
no
more
fear
of
being
arrested
by
her
former
master
or
any
other
person
when
in
his
immediate
neighborhood
than
she
did
in
the
state
of
new
york
or
canada
for
she
said
she
never
ventured
only
where
god
sent
her
and
her
faith
in
the
supreme
power
truly
was
great
i
have
now
been
confined
to
my
room
with
indisposition
more
than
four
weeks
and
can
not
sit
to
write
much
but
i
feel
so
much
interested
in
harriet
that
i
will
try
to
give
some
of
the
most
remarkable
incidents
that
now
present
themselves
to
my
mind
the
date
of
the
commencement
of
her
labors
i
can
not
certainly
give
but
i
think
it
must
have
been
about
from
that
time
till
i
think
she
must
have
brought
from
the
neighborhood
where
she
had
been
held
as
a
slave
from
to
persons
c
from
maryland
some
miles
from
here
no
slave
who
placed
himself
under
her
care
was
ever
arrested
that
i
have
heard
of
she
mostly
had
her
regular
stopping
places
on
her
route
but
in
one
instance
when
she
had
several
stout
men
with
her
some
miles
below
here
she
said
that
god
told
her
to
stop
which
she
did
and
then
asked
him
what
she
must
do
he
told
her
to
leave
the
road
and
turn
to
the
left
she
obeyed
and
soon
came
to
a
small
stream
of
tide
water
there
was
no
boat
no
bridge
she
again
inquired
of
her
guide
what
she
was
to
do
she
was
told
to
go
through
it
was
cold
in
the
month
of
march
but
having
confidence
in
her
guide
she
went
in
the
water
came
up
to
her
armpits
the
men
refused
to
follow
till
they
saw
her
safe
on
the
opposite
shore
they
then
followed
and
if
i
mistake
not
she
had
soon
to
wade
a
second
stream
soon
after
which
she
came
to
a
cabin
of
colored
people
who
took
them
all
in
put
them
to
bed
and
dried
their
clothes
ready
to
proceed
next
night
on
their
journey
harriet
had
run
out
of
money
and
gave
them
some
of
her
underclothing
to
pay
for
their
kindness
when
she
called
on
me
two
days
after
she
was
so
hoarse
she
could
hardly
speak
and
was
also
suffering
with
violent
toothache
the
strange
part
of
the
story
we
found
to
be
that
the
masters
of
these
men
had
put
up
the
previous
day
at
the
railroad
station
near
where
she
left
an
advertisement
for
them
offering
a
large
reward
for
their
apprehension
but
they
made
a
safe
exit
she
at
one
time
brought
as
many
as
seven
or
eight
several
of
whom
were
women
and
children
she
was
well
known
here
in
chester
county
and
philadelphia
and
respected
by
all
true
abolitionists
i
had
been
in
the
habit
of
furnishing
her
and
those
who
accompanied
her
as
she
returned
from
her
acts
of
mercy
with
new
shoes
and
on
one
occasion
when
i
had
not
seen
her
for
three
months
she
came
into
my
store
i
said
harriet
i
am
glad
to
see
thee
i
suppose
thee
wants
a
pair
of
new
shoes
her
reply
was
i
want
more
than
that
i
in
jest
said
i
have
always
been
liberal
with
thee
and
wish
to
be
but
i
am
not
rich
and
can
not
afford
to
give
much
her
reply
was
god
tells
me
you
have
money
for
me
i
asked
her
if
god
never
deceived
her
she
said
no
well
how
much
does
thee
want
after
studying
a
moment
she
said
about
dollars
i
then
gave
her
dollars
and
some
odd
cents
the
net
proceeds
of
five
pounds
sterling
received
through
eliza
wigham
of
scotland
for
her
i
had
given
some
accounts
of
harriet
labor
to
the
society
of
edinburgh
of
which
eliza
wigham
was
secretary
on
the
reading
of
my
letter
a
gentleman
present
said
he
would
send
harriet
four
pounds
if
he
knew
of
any
way
to
get
it
to
her
eliza
wigham
offered
to
forward
it
to
me
for
her
and
that
was
the
first
money
ever
received
by
me
for
her
some
twelve
months
after
she
called
on
me
again
and
said
that
god
told
her
i
had
some
money
for
her
but
not
so
much
as
before
i
had
a
few
days
previous
received
the
net
proceeds
of
one
pound
ten
shillings
from
europe
for
her
to
say
the
least
there
was
something
remarkable
in
these
facts
whether
clairvoyance
or
the
divine
impression
on
her
mind
from
the
source
of
all
power
i
can
not
tell
but
certain
it
was
she
had
a
guide
within
herself
other
than
the
written
word
for
she
never
had
any
education
she
brought
away
her
aged
parents
in
a
singular
manner
they
started
with
an
old
horse
fitted
out
in
primitive
style
with
a
a
pair
of
old
chaise
wheels
with
a
board
on
the
axle
to
sit
on
another
board
swung
with
ropes
fastened
to
the
axle
to
rest
their
feet
on
she
got
her
parents
who
were
both
slaves
belonging
to
different
masters
on
this
rude
vehicle
to
the
railroad
put
them
in
the
cars
turned
jehu
herself
and
drove
to
town
in
a
style
that
no
human
being
ever
did
before
or
since
but
she
was
happy
at
having
arrived
safe
next
day
i
furnished
her
with
money
to
take
them
all
to
canada
i
afterward
sold
their
horse
and
sent
them
the
balance
of
the
proceeds
i
believe
that
harriet
succeeded
in
freeing
all
her
relatives
but
one
sister
and
her
three
children
etc
thy
friend
thos
garrett
footnote
c
friend
garrett
probably
refers
here
to
those
who
passed
through
his
hands
harriet
was
obliged
to
come
by
many
different
routes
on
her
different
journeys
and
though
she
never
counted
those
whom
she
brought
away
with
her
it
would
seem
by
the
computation
of
others
that
there
must
have
been
somewhat
over
three
hundred
brought
by
her
to
the
northern
states
and
canada
as
i
have
before
stated
with
all
harriet
reluctance
to
ask
for
anything
for
herself
no
matter
how
great
her
needs
may
be
no
such
scruples
trouble
her
if
any
of
her
people
are
in
need
she
never
hesitates
to
call
upon
her
kind
friends
in
auburn
and
in
other
places
for
help
when
her
people
are
in
want
at
one
time
when
some
such
emergency
had
arisen
she
went
to
see
her
friend
governor
seward
and
boldly
presented
her
case
to
him
harriet
he
said
you
have
worked
for
others
long
enough
if
you
would
ever
ask
anything
for
yourself
i
would
gladly
give
it
to
you
but
i
will
not
help
you
to
rob
yourself
for
others
any
longer
in
spite
of
this
apparent
roughness
we
may
be
sure
harriet
did
not
leave
this
noble
man
house
empty
handed
and
here
i
am
reminded
of
a
touching
little
circumstance
that
occurred
at
the
funeral
of
secretary
seward
the
great
man
lay
in
his
coffin
friends
children
and
admirers
were
gathered
there
everything
that
love
and
wealth
could
do
had
been
done
around
him
were
floral
emblems
of
every
possible
shape
and
design
that
human
ingenuity
could
suggest
or
money
could
purchase
just
before
the
coffin
was
to
be
closed
a
woman
black
as
night
stole
quietly
in
and
laying
a
wreath
of
field
flowers
his
as
quietly
glided
out
again
this
was
the
simple
tribute
of
our
sable
friend
and
her
last
token
of
love
and
gratitude
to
her
kind
benefactor
i
think
he
would
have
said
this
woman
hath
done
more
than
ye
all
while
preparing
this
second
edition
of
harriet
story
i
have
been
much
pleased
to
find
that
that
good
man
oliver
johnson
is
still
living
and
in
new
york
city
and
i
have
just
returned
from
a
very
pleasant
interview
with
him
he
remembers
harriet
with
great
pleasure
though
he
has
not
seen
her
for
many
years
he
speaks
as
all
who
knew
her
do
of
his
entire
confidence
in
her
truthfulness
and
in
the
perfect
integrity
of
her
character
he
remembered
her
coming
into
his
office
with
joe
as
i
have
stated
it
and
said
he
wished
he
could
recall
to
me
other
incidents
connected
with
her
but
during
those
years
there
were
such
numbers
of
fugitive
slaves
coming
into
the
office
that
he
might
not
tell
the
incidents
of
any
one
group
correctly
no
records
were
kept
as
that
would
be
so
unsafe
for
the
poor
creatures
and
those
who
aided
them
he
said
you
know
harriet
never
spoke
of
anything
she
had
done
as
if
it
was
at
all
remarkable
or
as
if
it
deserved
any
commendation
but
i
remember
one
day
when
she
came
into
the
office
there
was
a
boston
lady
there
a
impulsive
woman
who
was
engaged
heart
and
hand
in
the
cause
harriet
was
telling
in
her
simple
way
the
story
of
her
last
journey
a
party
of
fugitives
were
to
meet
her
in
a
wood
that
she
might
conduct
them
north
for
some
unexplained
reason
they
did
not
come
night
came
on
and
with
it
a
blinding
snow
storm
and
a
raging
wind
she
protected
herself
behind
a
tree
as
well
as
she
could
and
remained
all
night
alone
exposed
to
the
fury
of
the
storm
harriet
said
this
lady
you
almost
feel
when
you
were
lying
alone
as
if
there
was
no
missus
said
harriet
looking
up
in
her
simple
way
jest
asked
jesus
to
take
keer
of
me
an
he
never
let
me
git
one
bit
in
the
first
gun
was
fired
from
fort
sumter
and
this
was
the
signal
for
a
rush
to
arms
at
the
north
and
the
south
and
the
war
of
the
rebellion
was
begun
troops
were
hurried
off
from
the
north
to
the
west
and
the
south
and
battles
raged
in
every
part
of
the
southern
states
by
land
and
by
sea
and
on
the
southern
rivers
the
conflict
raged
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
brave
men
shed
their
blood
for
what
was
maintained
by
each
side
to
be
the
true
principle
this
war
our
brave
heroine
had
expected
and
its
result
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
three
years
before
while
staying
with
the
rev
henry
highland
garnet
in
new
york
a
vision
came
to
her
in
the
night
of
the
emancipation
of
her
people
whether
a
dream
or
one
of
those
glimpses
into
the
future
which
sometimes
seem
to
have
been
granted
to
her
no
one
can
say
but
the
effect
upon
her
was
very
remarkable
she
rose
singing
people
are
free
my
people
are
she
came
down
to
breakfast
singing
the
words
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
she
could
not
eat
the
dream
or
vision
filled
her
whole
soul
and
physical
needs
were
forgotten
garnet
said
to
her
oh
harriet
harriet
you
come
to
torment
us
before
the
time
do
cease
this
noise
my
grandchildren
may
see
the
day
of
the
emancipation
of
our
people
but
you
and
i
will
never
see
it
i
tell
you
sir
you
see
it
and
you
see
it
soon
my
people
are
free
my
people
are
free
when
three
years
later
president
lincoln
proclamation
of
emancipation
was
given
forth
and
there
was
a
great
jubilee
among
the
friends
of
the
slaves
harriet
was
continually
asked
why
do
you
not
join
with
the
rest
in
their
rejoicing
oh
she
answered
i
had
jubilee
three
years
ago
i
rejoiced
all
i
could
den
i
ca
rejoice
no
more
in
some
of
the
southern
states
spies
and
scouts
were
needed
to
lead
our
armies
into
the
interior
the
ignorant
and
degraded
slaves
feared
the
yankee
buckra
more
than
they
did
their
own
masters
and
after
the
proclamation
of
president
lincoln
giving
freedom
to
the
slaves
a
person
in
whom
these
poor
creatures
could
trust
was
needed
to
assure
them
that
these
white
northern
men
were
friends
and
that
they
would
be
safe
trusting
themselves
in
their
hands
in
the
early
days
of
the
war
governor
andrew
of
massachusetts
knowing
well
the
brave
and
sagacious
character
of
harriet
sent
for
her
and
asked
her
if
she
could
go
at
a
moment
notice
to
act
as
spy
and
scout
for
our
armies
and
if
need
be
to
act
as
hospital
nurse
in
short
to
be
ready
to
give
any
required
service
to
the
union
cause
there
was
much
to
be
thought
of
there
were
the
old
folks
in
the
little
home
up
in
auburn
there
was
the
little
farm
of
which
she
had
taken
the
sole
care
there
were
many
dependents
for
whom
she
had
provided
by
her
daily
toil
what
was
to
become
of
them
all
if
she
deserted
them
but
the
cause
of
the
union
seemed
to
need
her
services
and
after
a
few
moments
of
reflection
she
determined
to
leave
all
else
and
go
where
it
seemed
that
duty
called
her
during
those
few
years
the
wants
of
the
old
people
and
of
harriet
other
dependents
were
attended
to
by
the
kind
people
of
auburn
at
that
time
i
often
saw
the
old
people
and
wrote
letters
for
them
to
officers
at
the
south
asking
from
them
tidings
of
harriet
i
received
many
letters
in
reply
all
testifying
to
her
faithfulness
and
bravery
and
her
untiring
zeal
for
the
welfare
of
our
soldiers
black
and
white
she
was
often
under
fire
from
both
armies
she
led
our
forces
through
the
jungle
and
the
swamp
guided
by
an
unseen
hand
she
gained
the
confidence
of
the
slaves
by
her
cheery
words
and
songs
and
sacred
hymns
and
obtained
from
them
much
valuable
information
she
nursed
our
soldiers
in
the
hospitals
and
knew
how
when
they
were
dying
by
numbers
of
some
malignant
disease
with
cunning
skill
to
extract
from
roots
and
herbs
which
grew
near
the
source
of
the
disease
the
healing
draught
which
allayed
the
fever
and
restored
numbers
to
health
it
is
a
shame
to
our
government
that
such
a
valuable
helper
as
this
woman
was
not
allowed
pay
or
pension
but
even
was
obliged
to
support
herself
during
those
days
of
incessant
toil
officers
and
men
were
paid
indeed
many
enlisted
from
no
patriotic
motive
but
because
they
were
insured
a
support
which
they
could
not
procure
for
themselves
at
home
but
this
woman
sacrificed
everything
and
left
her
nearest
and
dearest
and
risked
her
life
hundreds
of
times
for
the
cause
of
the
union
without
one
cent
of
recompense
she
returned
at
last
to
her
little
home
to
find
it
a
scene
of
desolation
her
little
place
about
to
be
sold
to
satisfy
a
mortgage
and
herself
without
the
means
to
redeem
it
harriet
was
one
of
john
brown
men
his
brave
and
daring
spirit
found
ready
sympathy
in
her
courageous
heart
she
sheltered
him
in
her
home
in
canada
and
helped
him
to
plan
his
campaigns
i
find
in
the
life
and
letters
of
this
remarkable
man
written
by
sanborn
occasional
mention
of
harriet
and
her
deep
interest
in
captain
brown
enterprises
at
one
time
he
writes
to
his
son
from
catherine
canada
i
came
on
here
the
day
after
you
left
rochester
i
am
succeeding
to
all
appearance
beyond
my
expectations
harriet
tubman
on
her
whole
team
at
he
harriet
is
the
most
of
a
man
naturally
that
i
ever
met
with
there
is
abundant
material
here
and
of
the
right
quality
she
suggested
the
of
july
to
him
as
the
time
to
begin
operations
and
sanborn
adds
it
was
about
the
of
july
as
harriet
the
african
sybil
had
suggested
that
brown
first
showed
himself
in
the
counties
of
washington
and
jefferson
on
opposite
sides
of
the
lordly
potomac
i
find
among
her
papers
many
of
which
are
defaced
by
being
carried
about
with
her
for
years
portions
of
these
letters
addressed
to
myself
by
persons
at
the
south
and
speaking
of
the
valuable
assistance
harriet
was
rendering
our
soldiers
in
the
hospital
and
our
armies
in
the
field
at
this
time
her
manner
of
life
as
related
by
herself
was
this
well
missus
i
go
to
de
hospital
i
would
early
mornin
i
get
a
big
chunk
of
ice
i

basin
and
fill
it
with

de
fust
ones
black
an
thick
as
eber
in
this
way
she
worked
day
after
day
till
late
at
night
then
she
went
home
to
her
little
cabin
and
made
about
fifty
pies
a
great
quantity
of
and
two
casks
of
root
beer
these
she
would
hire
some
contraband
to
sell
for
her
through
the
camps
and
thus
she
would
provide
her
support
for
another
day
for
this
woman
never
received
pay
or
pension
and
never
drew
for
herself
but
twenty
days
rations
during
the
four
years
of
her
labors
at
one
time
she
was
called
away
from
hilton
head
by
one
of
our
officers
to
come
to
fernandina
where
the
men
were
dying
off
like
sheep
from
dysentery
harriet
had
acquired
quite
a
reputation
for
her
skill
in
curing
this
disease
by
a
medicine
which
she
prepared
from
roots
which
grew
near
the
waters
which
gave
the
disease
here
she
found
thousands
of
sick
soldiers
and
contrabands
and
immediately
gave
up
her
time
and
attention
to
them
at
another
time
we
find
her
nursing
those
who
were
down
by
hundreds
with
and
malignant
fevers
she
had
never
had
these
diseases
but
she
seems
to
have
no
more
fear
of
death
in
one
form
than
another
de
lord
would
take
keer
of
her
till
her
time
came
an
den
she
was
ready
to
go
when
our
armies
and
first
appeared
in
any
part
of
the
south
many
of
the
poor
negroes
were
as
much
afraid
of
de
yankee
buckra
as
of
their
own
masters
it
was
almost
impossible
to
win
their
confidence
or
to
get
information
from
them
but
to
harriet
they
would
tell
anything
and
so
it
became
quite
important
that
she
should
accompany
expeditions
going
up
the
rivers
or
into
unexplored
parts
of
the
country
to
control
and
get
information
from
those
whom
they
took
with
them
as
guides
general
hunter
asked
her
at
one
time
if
she
would
go
with
several
up
the
combahee
river
the
object
of
the
expedition
being
to
take
up
the
torpedoes
placed
by
the
rebels
in
the
river
to
destroy
railroads
and
bridges
and
to
cut
off
supplies
from
the
rebel
troops
she
said
she
would
go
if
colonel
montgomery
was
to
be
appointed
commander
of
the
expedition
colonel
montgomery
was
one
of
john
brown
men
and
was
well
known
to
harriet
accordingly
colonel
montgomery
was
appointed
to
the
command
and
harriet
with
several
men
under
her
the
principal
of
whom
was
plowden
whose
pass
i
have
accompanied
the
expedition
harriet
describes
in
the
most
graphic
manner
the
appearance
of
the
plantations
as
they
passed
up
the
river
the
frightened
negroes
leaving
their
work
and
taking
to
the
woods
at
sight
of
the
then
coming
to
peer
out
like
startled
deer
and
scudding
away
like
the
wind
at
the
sound
of
the
well
said
one
old
negro
said
de
yankees
had
horns
and
tails
but
i
nebber
beliebed
it
till
now
but
the
word
was
passed
along
by
the
mysterious
telegraphic
communication
existing
among
these
simple
people
that
these
were
lincoln
come
to
set
them
free
in
vain
then
the
drivers
used
their
whips
in
their
efforts
to
hurry
the
poor
creatures
back
to
their
quarters
they
all
turned
and
ran
for
the
they
came
down
every
road
across
every
field
just
as
they
had
left
their
work
and
their
cabins
women
with
children
clinging
around
their
necks
hanging
to
their
dresses
running
behind
all
making
at
full
speed
for
lincoln
eight
hundred
poor
wretches
at
one
time
crowded
the
banks
with
their
hands
extended
toward
their
deliverers
and
they
were
all
taken
off
upon
the
and
carried
down
to
beaufort
i
nebber

harriet

jeff

sometimes

like

taggin
behin
all
loaded

squealin
chickens
screamin
young

squallin
and
so
they
came
pouring
down
to
the
when
they
stood
on
the
shore
and
the
small
boats
put
out
to
take
them
off
they
all
wanted
to
get
in
at
once
after
the
boats
were
crowded
they
would
hold
on
to
them
so
that
they
could
not
leave
the
shore
the
oarsmen
would
beat
them
on
their
hands
but
they
would
not
let
go
they
were
afraid
the
would
go
off
and
leave
them
and
all
wanted
to
make
sure
of
one
of
these
arks
of
refuge
at
length
colonel
montgomery
shouted
from
the
upper
deck
above
the
clamor
of
appealing
tones
moses
you
have
to
give
em
a
song
then
harriet
lifted
up
her
voice
and
sang
of
all
the
whole
creation
in
the
east
or
in
the
west
the
glorious
yankee
nation
is
the
greatest
and
the
best
come
along
come
along
do
be
alarmed
uncle
sam
is
rich
enough
to
give
you
all
a
farm
at
the
end
of
every
verse
the
negroes
in
their
enthusiasm
would
throw
up
their
hands
and
shout
glory
and
the
would
take
that
opportunity
to
push
off
and
so
at
last
they
were
all
brought
on
board
the
masters
fled
houses
and
barns
and
railroad
bridges
were
burned
tracks
torn
up
torpedoes
destroyed
and
the
object
of
the
expedition
was
fully
accomplished
this
fearless
woman
was
often
sent
into
the
rebel
lines
as
a
spy
and
brought
back
valuable
information
as
to
the
position
of
armies
and
batteries
she
has
been
in
battle
when
the
shot
was
falling
like
hail
and
the
bodies
of
dead
and
wounded
men
were
dropping
around
her
like
leaves
in
autumn
but
the
thought
of
fear
never
seems
to
have
had
place
for
a
moment
in
her
mind
she
had
her
duty
to
perform
and
she
expected
to
be
taken
care
of
till
it
was
done
would
that
instead
of
taking
them
in
this
poor
way
at
my
readers
could
hear
this
woman
graphic
accounts
of
scenes
she
herself
witnessed
could
listen
to
her
imitations
of
negro
preachers
in
their
own
very
peculiar
dialect
her
singing
of
hymns
her
account
of
experience
meetings
her
imitations
of
the
dances
and
the
funeral
ceremonies
of
these
simple
people
why
der
language
down
dar
in
de
far
south
is
as
different
from
ours
in
maryland
as
you
can
tink
said
she
dey
laughed
when
dey
heard
me
talk
an
i
could
not
understand
dem
no
how
she
described
a
midnight
funeral
which
she
attended
for
the
slaves
never
having
been
allowed
to
bury
their
dead
in
the
continued
the
custom
of
night
funerals
from
habit
the
corpse
was
laid
upon
the
ground
and
the
people
all
sat
round
the
group
being
lighted
up
by
pine
torches
the
old
negro
preacher
began
by
giving
out
a
hymn
which
was
sung
by
all
an
oh

wish

the
old
preacher
began
his
sermon
by
pointing
to
the
dead
man
who
lay
in
a
rude
box
on
the
ground
before
him
now
i

this
was
the
burden
of
a
very
long
sermon
after
which
the
whole
congregation
went
round
in
a
sort
of
solemn
dance
called
the
spiritual
shuffle
shaking
hands
with
each
other
and
calling
each
other
by
name
as
they
sang

company
when
they
came
to
harriet
who
was
a
stranger
they
sang
eberybody
boun
to

the
body
was
then
placed
in
a
government
wagon
and
by
the
light
of
the
pine
torches
the
strange
dark
procession
moved
along
singing
a
rude
funeral
hymn
till
they
reached
the
place
of
burial
harriet
account
of
her
interview
with
an
old
negro
she
met
at
hilton
head
is
amusing
and
interesting

footnote
d
the
the
following
account
of
the
subject
of
this
memoir
is
cut
from
the
of
kindly
sent
the
writer
by
sanborn
it
was
said
long
ago
that
the
true
romance
of
america
was
not
in
the
fortunes
of
the
indian
where
cooper
sought
it
nor
in
new
england
character
where
judd
found
it
nor
in
the
social
contrasts
of
virginia
planters
as
thackeray
imagined
but
in
the
story
of
the
fugitive
slaves
the
observation
is
as
true
now
as
it
was
before
war
with
swift
gigantic
hand
sketched
the
vast
shadows
and
dashed
in
the
high
lights
in
which
romance
loves
to
lurk
and
flash
forth
but
the
stage
is
enlarged
on
which
these
dramas
are
played
the
whole
world
now
sit
as
spectators
and
the
desperation
or
the
magnanimity
of
a
poor
black
woman
has
power
to
shake
the
nation
that
so
long
was
deaf
to
her
cries
we
write
of
one
of
these
heroines
of
whom
our
slave
annals
are
full
a
woman
whose
career
is
as
extraordinary
as
the
most
famous
of
her
sex
can
show
araminta
ross
now
known
by
her
married
name
of
tubman
with
her
sounding
christian
name
changed
to
harriet
is
the
of
a
slave
imported
from
africa
and
has
not
a
drop
of
white
blood
in
her
veins
her
parents
were
benjamin
ross
and
harriet
greene
both
slaves
but
married
and
faithful
to
each
other
they
still
live
in
old
age
and
poverty
e
but
free
on
a
little
property
at
auburn
which
their
daughter
purchased
for
them
from
seward
the
secretary
of
state
she
was
born
as
near
as
she
can
remember
in
or
in
in
dorchester
county
on
the
eastern
shore
of
maryland
and
not
far
from
the
town
of
cambridge
she
had
ten
brothers
and
sisters
of
whom
three
are
now
living
all
at
the
north
and
all
rescued
from
slavery
by
harriet
before
the
war
she
went
back
just
as
the
south
was
preparing
to
secede
to
bring
away
a
fourth
but
before
she
could
reach
her
she
was
dead
three
years
before
she
had
brought
away
her
old
father
and
mother
at
great
risk
to
herself
footnote
e
both
dead
for
some
years
when
harriet
was
six
years
old
she
was
taken
from
her
mother
and
carried
ten
miles
to
live
with
james
cook
whose
wife
was
a
weaver
to
learn
the
trade
of
weaving
while
still
a
mere
child
cook
set
her
to
watching
his
traps
which
compelled
her
to
wade
through
the
water
it
happened
that
she
was
once
sent
when
she
was
ill
with
the
measles
and
taking
cold
from
wading
in
the
water
in
this
condition
she
grew
very
sick
and
her
mother
persuaded
her
master
to
take
her
away
from
cook
until
she
could
get
well
another
attempt
was
made
to
teach
her
weaving
but
she
would
not
learn
for
she
hated
her
mistress
and
did
not
want
to
live
at
home
as
she
would
have
done
as
a
weaver
for
it
was
the
custom
then
to
weave
the
cloth
for
the
family
or
a
part
of
it
in
the
house
soon
after
she
entered
her
teens
she
was
hired
out
as
a
field
hand
and
it
was
while
thus
employed
that
she
received
a
wound
which
nearly
proved
fatal
from
the
effects
of
which
she
still
suffers
in
the
fall
of
the
year
the
slaves
there
work
in
the
evening
cleaning
up
wheat
husking
corn
etc
on
this
occasion
one
of
the
slaves
of
a
farmer
named
barrett
left
his
work
and
went
to
the
village
store
in
the
evening
the
overseer
followed
him
and
so
did
harriet
when
the
slave
was
found
the
overseer
swore
he
should
be
whipped
and
called
on
harriet
among
others
to
help
tie
him
she
refused
and
as
the
man
ran
away
she
placed
herself
in
the
door
to
stop
pursuit
the
overseer
caught
up
a
weight
from
the
counter
and
threw
it
at
the
fugitive
but
it
fell
short
and
struck
harriet
a
stunning
blow
on
the
head
it
was
long
before
she
recovered
from
this
and
it
has
left
her
subject
to
a
sort
of
stupor
or
lethargy
at
times
coming
upon
her
in
the
midst
of
conversation
or
whatever
she
may
be
doing
and
throwing
her
into
a
deep
slumber
from
which
she
will
presently
rouse
herself
and
go
on
with
her
conversation
or
work
after
this
she
lived
for
five
or
six
years
with
john
stewart
where
at
first
she
worked
in
the
house
but
afterward
her
time
and
thompson
son
of
her
master
guardian
for
her
that
is
was
her
surety
for
the
payment
of
what
she
owed
she
employed
the
time
thus
hired
in
the
rudest
labors
drove
oxen
carted
plowed
and
did
all
the
work
of
a
man
sometimes
earning
money
enough
in
a
year
beyond
what
she
paid
her
master
buy
a
pair
of
steers
worth
forty
dollars
the
amount
exacted
of
a
woman
for
her
time
was
fifty
or
sixty
dollars
of
a
man
one
hundred
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
frequently
harriet
worked
for
her
father
who
was
a
timber
inspector
and
superintended
the
cutting
and
hauling
of
great
quantities
of
timber
for
the
baltimore
stewart
his
temporary
master
was
a
builder
and
for
the
work
of
ross
used
to
receive
as
much
as
five
dollars
a
day
sometimes
he
being
a
superior
workman
while
engaged
with
her
father
she
would
cut
wood
haul
logs
etc
her
usual
was
half
a
cord
of
wood
in
a
day
harriet
was
married
somewhere
about
to
a
free
colored
man
named
john
tubman
but
she
had
no
children
for
the
last
two
years
of
slavery
she
lived
with
thompson
before
mentioned
her
own
master
not
being
yet
of
age
and
father
being
his
guardian
as
well
as
the
owner
of
her
own
father
in
the
young
man
died
and
the
slaves
were
to
be
sold
though
previously
set
free
by
an
old
will
harriet
resolved
not
to
be
sold
and
so
with
no
knowledge
of
the
north
having
only
heard
of
pennsylvania
and
new
jersey
she
walked
away
one
night
alone
she
found
a
friend
in
a
white
lady
who
knew
her
story
and
helped
her
on
her
way
after
many
adventures
she
reached
philadelphia
where
she
found
work
and
earned
a
small
stock
of
money
with
this
money
in
her
purse
she
traveled
back
to
maryland
for
her
husband
but
she
found
him
married
to
another
woman
and
no
longer
caring
to
live
with
her
this
however
was
not
until
two
years
after
her
escape
for
she
does
not
seem
to
have
reached
her
old
home
in
the
first
two
expeditions
in
december
she
had
visited
baltimore
and
brought
away
her
sister
and
two
children
who
had
come
up
from
cambridge
in
a
boat
under
charge
of
her
sister
husband
a
free
black
a
few
months
after
she
had
brought
away
her
brother
and
two
other
men
but
it
was
not
till
the
fall
of
that
she
found
her
husband
and
learned
of
his
infidelity
she
did
not
give
way
to
rage
or
grief
but
collected
a
party
of
fugitives
and
brought
them
safely
to
philadelphia
in
december
of
the
same
year
she
returned
and
led
out
a
party
of
eleven
among
them
her
brother
and
his
wife
with
these
she
journeyed
to
canada
and
there
spent
the
winter
for
this
was
after
the
enforcement
of
mason
fugitive
slave
bill
in
philadelphia
and
boston
and
there
was
no
safety
except
the
paw
of
the
british
lion
as
she
quaintly
said
but
the
first
winter
was
terribly
severe
for
these
poor
runaways
they
earned
their
bread
by
chopping
wood
in
the
snows
of
a
canadian
forest
they
were
hungry
and
naked
harriet
was
their
good
angel
she
kept
house
for
her
brother
and
the
poor
creatures
boarded
with
her
she
worked
for
them
begged
for
them
prayed
for
them
with
the
strange
familiarity
of
communion
with
god
which
seems
natural
to
these
people
and
carried
them
by
the
help
of
god
through
the
hard
winter
in
the
spring
she
returned
to
the
states
and
as
usual
earned
money
by
working
in
hotels
and
families
as
a
cook
from
cape
may
in
the
fall
of
she
went
back
once
more
to
maryland
and
brought
away
nine
more
fugitives
up
to
this
time
she
had
expended
chiefly
her
own
money
in
these
expeditions
money
which
she
had
earned
by
hard
work
in
the
drudgery
of
the
kitchen
never
did
any
one
more
exactly
fulfill
the
sense
of
george
herbert
servant
with
this
clause
makes
drudgery
divine
but
it
was
not
possible
for
such
virtues
long
to
remain
hidden
from
the
keen
eyes
of
the
abolitionists
she
became
known
to
thomas
garrett
the
quaker
of
wilmington
who
has
aided
the
escape
of
three
thousand
fugitives
she
found
warm
friends
in
philadelphia
and
new
york
and
wherever
she
went
these
gave
her
money
which
he
never
spent
for
her
own
use
but
laid
up
for
the
help
of
her
people
and
especially
for
her
journeys
back
to
the
of
egypt
as
she
called
her
old
home
by
reason
of
her
frequent
visits
there
always
carrying
away
some
of
the
oppressed
she
got
among
her
people
the
name
of
which
it
seems
she
still
retains
between
and
she
made
but
two
of
these
journeys
in
consequence
partly
of
the
increased
vigilance
of
the
who
had
suffered
so
much
by
the
loss
of
their
property
a
great
reward
was
offered
for
her
capture
and
she
several
times
was
on
the
point
of
being
taken
but
always
escaped
by
her
quick
wit
or
by
from
heaven
for
it
is
time
to
notice
one
singular
trait
in
her
character
she
is
the
most
shrewd
and
practical
person
in
the
world
yet
she
is
a
firm
believer
in
omens
dreams
and
warnings
she
declares
that
before
her
escape
from
slavery
she
used
to
dream
of
flying
over
fields
and
towns
and
rivers
and
mountains
looking
down
upon
them
a
bird
and
reaching
at
last
a
great
fence
or
sometimes
a
river
over
which
she
would
try
to
fly
it
like
i
would
hab
de
strength
and
jes
as
i
was
sinkin
down
dere
would
be
ladies
all
drest
in
white
ober
dere
and
dey
would
put
out
dere
arms
and
pull
me
there
is
nothing
strange
in
this
perhaps
but
she
declares
that
when
she
came
north
she
remembered
these
very
places
as
those
she
had
seen
in
her
dreams
and
many
of
the
ladies
who
befriended
her
were
those
she
had
been
helped
by
in
her
vision
then
she
says
she
always
knows
when
there
is
danger
near
her
she
does
not
know
how
exactly
but
pears
like
my
heart
go
flutter
flutter
and
den
dey
may
say
peace
peace
as
much
as
dey
likes
know
its
gwine
to
be
she
is
very
firm
on
this
point
and
ascribes
to
this
her
great
impunity
in
spite
of
the
lethargy
before
mentioned
which
would
seem
likely
to
throw
her
into
the
hands
of
her
enemies
she
says
she
inherited
this
power
that
her
father
could
always
predict
the
weather
and
that
he
foretold
the
mexican
war
in
she
made
her
most
venturesome
journey
for
she
brought
with
her
to
the
north
her
old
parents
who
were
no
longer
able
to
walk
such
distances
as
she
must
go
by
night
consequently
she
must
hire
a
wagon
for
them
and
it
required
all
her
ingenuity
to
get
them
through
maryland
and
delaware
safe
she
accomplished
it
however
and
by
the
aid
of
her
friends
she
brought
them
safe
to
canada
where
they
spent
the
winter
her
account
of
their
sufferings
there
of
her
mother
complaining
and
her
own
philosophy
about
it
is
a
lesson
of
trust
in
providence
better
than
many
sermons
but
she
decided
to
bring
them
to
a
more
comfortable
place
and
so
she
negotiated
with
seward
then
in
the
senate
for
a
little
patch
of
ground
to
the
credit
of
the
secretary
of
state
it
should
be
said
that
he
sold
her
the
property
on
very
favorable
terms
and
gave
her
some
time
for
payment
to
this
house
she
removed
her
parents
and
set
herself
to
work
to
pay
for
the
purchase
it
was
on
this
errand
that
she
first
visited
boston
we
believe
in
the
winter
of
she
brought
a
few
letters
from
her
friends
in
new
york
but
she
could
herself
neither
read
nor
write
and
she
was
obliged
to
trust
to
her
wits
that
they
were
delivered
to
the
right
persons
one
of
them
as
it
happened
was
to
the
present
writer
who
received
it
by
another
hand
and
called
to
see
her
at
her
it
was
curious
to
see
the
caution
with
which
she
received
her
visitor
until
she
felt
assured
that
there
was
no
mistake
one
of
her
means
of
security
was
to
carry
with
her
the
daguerreotypes
of
her
friends
and
show
them
to
each
new
person
if
they
recognized
the
likeness
then
it
was
all
right
pains
were
taken
to
secure
her
the
attention
to
which
her
great
services
of
humanity
entitled
her
and
she
left
new
england
with
a
handsome
sum
of
money
toward
the
payment
of
her
debt
to
seward
before
she
left
however
she
had
several
interviews
with
captain
brown
then
in
boston
he
is
supposed
to
have
communicated
his
plans
to
her
and
to
have
been
aided
by
her
in
obtaining
recruits
and
money
among
her
people
at
any
rate
he
always
spoke
of
her
with
the
greatest
respect
and
declared
that
tubman
as
he
styled
her
was
a
better
officer
than
most
whom
he
had
seen
and
could
command
an
army
as
successfully
as
she
had
led
her
small
parties
of
fugitives
her
own
veneration
for
captain
brown
has
always
been
profound
and
since
his
murder
has
taken
the
form
of
a
religion
she
had
often
risked
her
own
life
for
her
people
and
she
thought
nothing
of
that
but
that
a
white
man
and
a
man
so
noble
and
strong
should
so
take
upon
himself
the
burden
of
a
despised
race
she
could
not
understand
and
she
took
refuge
from
her
perplexity
in
the
mysteries
of
her
fervid
religion
again
she
laid
great
stress
on
a
dream
which
she
had
just
before
she
met
captain
brown
in
canada
she
thought
she
was
in
wilderness
sort
of
place
all
full
of
rocks
and
bushes
when
she
saw
a
serpent
raise
its
head
among
the
rocks
and
as
it
did
so
it
became
the
head
of
an
old
man
with
a
long
white
beard
gazing
at
her
like
jes
as
ef
he
war
gwine
to
speak
to
me
and
then
two
other
heads
rose
up
beside
him
younger
than
he
and
as
she
stood
looking
at
them
and
wondering
what
they
could
want
with
her
a
great
crowd
of
men
rushed
in
and
struck
down
the
younger
heads
and
then
the
head
of
the
old
man
still
looking
at
her
so
this
dream
she
had
again
and
again
and
could
not
interpret
it
but
when
she
met
captain
brown
shortly
after
behold
he
was
the
very
image
of
the
head
she
had
seen
but
still
she
could
not
make
out
what
her
dream
signified
till
the
news
came
to
her
of
the
tragedy
of
harper
ferry
and
then
she
knew
the
two
other
heads
were
his
two
sons
she
was
in
new
york
at
that
time
and
on
the
day
of
the
affair
at
harper
ferry
she
felt
her
usual
warning
that
something
was
wrong
she
could
not
tell
what
finally
she
told
her
hostess
that
it
must
be
captain
brown
who
was
in
trouble
and
that
they
should
soon
hear
bad
news
from
him
the
next
day
newspaper
brought
tidings
of
what
had
happened
her
last
visit
to
maryland
was
made
after
this
in
december
and
in
spite
of
the
agitated
condition
of
the
country
and
the
greater
watchfulness
of
the
she
brought
away
seven
fugitives
one
of
them
an
infant
which
must
be
drugged
with
opium
to
keep
it
from
crying
on
the
way
and
so
revealing
the
of
the
party
in
the
spring
of
harriet
tubman
was
requested
by
gerrit
smith
to
go
to
boston
to
attend
a
large
meeting
on
her
way
she
stopped
at
troy
to
visit
a
cousin
and
while
there
the
colored
people
were
one
day
startled
with
the
intelligence
that
a
fugitive
slave
by
the
name
of
charles
nalle
had
been
followed
by
his
master
who
was
his
younger
brother
and
not
one
grain
whiter
than
he
and
that
he
was
already
in
the
hands
of
the
officers
and
was
to
be
taken
back
to
the
south
the
instant
harriet
heard
the
news
she
started
for
the
office
of
the
united
states
commissioner
scattering
the
tidings
as
she
went
an
excited
crowd
was
gathered
about
the
office
through
which
harriet
forced
her
way
and
rushed
up
stairs
to
the
door
of
the
room
where
the
fugitive
was
detained
a
wagon
was
already
waiting
before
the
door
to
carry
off
the
man
but
the
crowd
was
even
then
so
great
and
in
such
a
state
of
excitement
that
the
officers
did
not
dare
to
bring
the
man
down
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
stood
the
colored
people
watching
the
window
where
they
could
see
harriet
and
feeling
assured
that
so
long
as
she
stood
there
the
fugitive
was
still
in
the
office
time
passed
on
and
he
did
not
appear
they
taken
him
out
another
way
depend
upon
that
said
some
of
the
colored
people
no
replied
others
there
stands
yet
and
as
long
as
she
is
there
he
is
safe
harriet
now
seeing
the
necessity
for
a
tremendous
effort
for
his
rescue
sent
out
some
little
boys
to
cry
the
bells
rang
the
crowd
increased
till
the
whole
street
was
a
dense
mass
of
people
again
and
again
the
officers
came
out
to
try
and
clear
the
stairs
and
make
a
way
to
take
their
captive
down
others
were
driven
down
but
harriet
stood
her
ground
her
head
bent
and
her
arms
folded
come
old
woman
you
must
get
out
of
this
said
one
of
the
officers
i
must
have
the
way
cleared
if
you
ca
get
down
alone
some
one
will
help
you
harriet
still
putting
on
a
greater
appearance
of
decrepitude
twitched
away
from
him
and
kept
her
place
offers
were
made
to
buy
charles
from
his
master
who
at
first
agreed
to
take
twelve
hundred
dollars
for
him
but
when
this
was
subscribed
he
immediately
raised
the
price
to
fifteen
hundred
the
crowd
grew
more
excited
a
gentleman
raised
a
window
and
called
out
two
hundred
dollars
for
his
rescue
but
not
one
cent
to
his
master
this
was
responded
to
by
a
roar
of
satisfaction
from
the
crowd
below
at
length
the
officers
appeared
and
announced
to
the
crowd
that
if
they
would
open
a
lane
to
the
wagon
they
would
promise
to
bring
the
man
down
the
front
way
the
lane
was
opened
and
the
man
was
brought
out
a
tall
handsome
intelligent
man
with
his
wrists
manacled
together
walking
between
the
marshal
and
another
officer
and
behind
him
his
brother
and
his
master
so
like
him
that
one
could
hardly
be
told
from
the
other
the
moment
they
appeared
harriet
roused
from
her
stooping
posture
threw
up
a
window
and
cried
to
her
friends
here
he
comes
take
him
and
then
darted
down
the
stairs
like
a
she
seized
one
officer
and
pulled
him
down
then
another
and
tore
him
away
from
the
man
and
keeping
her
arms
about
the
slave
she
cried
to
her
friends
drag
us
out
drag
him
to
the
river
drown
him
but
do
let
them
have
him
they
were
knocked
down
together
and
while
down
she
tore
off
her
and
tied
it
on
the
head
of
the
fugitive
when
he
rose
only
his
head
could
be
seen
and
amid
the
surging
mass
of
people
the
slave
was
no
longer
recognized
while
the
master
appeared
like
the
slave
again
and
again
they
were
knocked
down
the
poor
slave
utterly
helpless
with
his
manacled
wrists
streaming
with
blood
harriet
outer
clothes
were
torn
from
her
and
even
her
stout
shoes
were
pulled
from
her
feet
yet
she
never
relinquished
her
hold
of
the
man
till
she
had
dragged
him
to
the
river
where
he
was
tumbled
into
a
boat
harriet
following
in
a
to
the
other
side
but
the
telegraph
was
ahead
of
them
and
as
soon
as
they
landed
he
was
seized
and
hurried
from
her
sight
after
a
time
some
school
children
came
hurrying
along
and
to
her
anxious
inquiries
they
answered
he
is
up
in
that
house
in
the
third
story
harriet
rushed
up
to
the
place
some
men
were
attempting
to
make
their
way
up
the
stairs
the
officers
were
firing
down
and
two
men
were
lying
on
the
stairs
who
had
been
shot
over
their
bodies
our
heroine
rushed
and
with
the
help
of
others
burst
open
the
door
of
the
room
and
dragged
out
the
fugitive
whom
harriet
carried
down
stairs
in
her
arms
a
gentleman
who
was
riding
by
with
a
fine
horse
stopped
to
ask
what
the
disturbance
meant
and
on
hearing
the
story
his
sympathies
seemed
to
be
thoroughly
aroused
he
sprang
from
his
wagon
calling
out
that
is
a
drive
him
till
he
drops
the
poor
man
was
hurried
in
some
of
his
friends
jumped
in
after
him
and
drove
at
the
most
rapid
rate
to
schenectady
this
is
the
story
harriet
told
to
the
writer
by
some
persons
it
seemed
too
wonderful
for
belief
and
an
attempt
was
made
to
corroborate
it
rev
henry
fowler
who
was
at
the
time
at
saratoga
kindly
volunteered
to
go
to
troy
and
ascertain
the
facts
his
report
was
that
he
had
had
a
long
interview
with
townsend
who
acted
during
the
trial
as
counsel
for
the
slave
that
he
had
given
him
a
rich
narration
which
he
would
write
out
the
next
week
for
this
little
book
but
before
he
was
to
begin
his
generous
labor
and
while
engaged
in
some
kind
efforts
for
the
prisoners
at
auburn
he
was
stricken
down
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
was
for
a
long
time
debarred
from
labor
this
good
man
died
not
long
after
and
the
promised
narration
was
never
written
but
a
statement
by
townsend
was
sent
me
which
i
copy
here
made
by
martin
townsend
of
troy
who
was
counsel
for
the
fugitive
charles
nalle
is
an
octoroon
his
wife
has
the
same
infusion
of
caucasian
blood
she
was
the
daughter
of
her
master
and
had
with
her
sister
been
bred
by
him
in
his
family
as
his
own
child
when
the
father
died
both
of
these
daughters
were
married
and
had
large
families
of
children
under
the
highly
christian
national
laws
of
old
virginny
these
children
were
the
slaves
of
their
grandfather
the
old
man
died
leaving
a
will
whereby
he
manumitted
his
daughters
and
their
children
and
provided
for
the
purchase
of
the
freedom
of
their
husbands
the
manumission
of
the
children
and
grandchildren
took
effect
but
the
estate
was
insufficient
to
purchase
the
husbands
of
his
daughters
and
the
fathers
of
his
grandchildren
the
manumitted
by
another
christian
conservative
and
national
provision
of
law
were
forced
to
leave
the
state
while
the
slave
husbands
remained
in
slavery
nalle
and
his
were
allowed
for
a
while
to
visit
their
families
outside
virginia
about
once
a
year
but
were
at
length
ordered
to
provide
themselves
with
new
wives
as
they
would
be
allowed
to
visit
their
former
ones
no
more
it
was
after
this
that
nalle
and
his
started
for
the
land
of
freedom
guided
by
the
steady
light
of
the
north
star
thank
god
neither
family
now
need
fear
any
earthly
master
or
the
bay
of
the
dogging
their
fugitive
steps
nalle
returned
to
troy
with
his
family
about
july
and
resided
with
them
there
for
more
than
seven
years
they
are
all
now
residents
of
the
city
of
washington
nalle
and
his
family
are
persons
of
refined
manners
and
of
the
highest
respectability
several
of
his
children
are
and
a
stranger
would
discover
no
trace
of
african
blood
in
their
complexions
or
features
it
was
the
head
of
this
family
whom
averill
proposed
to
doom
to
returnless
exile
and
slavery
when
nalle
was
brought
from
commissioner
beach
office
into
the
street
harriet
tubman
who
had
been
standing
with
the
excited
crowd
rushed
amongst
the
foremost
to
nalle
and
running
one
of
her
arms
around
his
manacled
arm
held
on
to
him
without
ever
loosening
her
hold
through
the
more
than
struggle
to
judge
gould
office
and
from
judge
gould
office
to
the
dock
where
nalle
liberation
was
accomplished
in
the
she
was
repeatedly
beaten
over
the
head
with
policemen
clubs
but
she
never
for
a
moment
released
her
hold
but
cheered
nalle
and
his
friends
with
her
voice
and
struggled
with
the
officers
until
they
were
literally
worn
out
with
their
exertions
and
nalle
was
separated
from
them
true
she
had
strong
and
earnest
helpers
in
her
struggle
some
of
whom
had
white
faces
as
well
as
human
hearts
and
are
now
in
heaven
but
she
exposed
herself
to
the
fury
of
the
sympathizers
with
slavery
without
fear
and
suffered
their
blows
without
flinching
harriet
crossed
the
river
with
the
crowd
in
the
and
when
the
men
who
led
the
assault
upon
the
door
of
judge
stewart
office
were
stricken
down
harriet
and
a
number
of
other
colored
women
rushed
over
their
bodies
brought
nalle
out
and
putting
him
in
the
first
wagon
passing
started
him
for
the
west
a
lively
team
driven
by
a
colored
man
was
immediately
sent
on
to
relieve
the
other
and
nalle
was
seen
about
troy
no
more
until
he
returned
a
free
man
by
purchase
from
his
master
harriet
also
disappeared
and
the
crowd
dispersed
how
she
came
to
be
in
troy
that
day
is
entirely
unknown
to
our
citizens
and
where
she
hid
herself
after
the
rescue
is
equally
a
mystery
but
her
struggle
was
in
the
sight
of
a
thousand
perhaps
of
five
thousand
spectators
on
asking
harriet
particularly
as
to
the
age
of
her
mother
she
answered
well
i
tell
you
missus
years
ago
in
maryland
i
paid
a
lawyer
five
dollars
to
look
up
the
will
of
my
mother
first
master
he
looked
back
sixty
years
and
said
it
was
time
to
give
up
i
told
him
to
go
back
furder
he
went
back
years
and
there
he
found
the
will
giving
the
girl
ritty
to
his
mary
patterson
to
serve
her
and
her
offspring
till
she
was
years
of
age
this
died
soon
after
unmarried
and
as
there
was
no
provision
for
ritty
in
case
of
her
death
she
was
actually
emancipated
at
that
time
but
no
one
informed
her
of
the
fact
and
she
and
her
dear
children
remained
in
bondage
till
emancipated
by
the
courage
and
determination
of
this
heroic
daughter
and
sister
the
old
woman
must
then
it
seems
be
years
of
age
f
and
the
old
man
has
probably
numbered
as
many
years
and
yet
these
old
people
living
out
beyond
the
on
the
south
street
road
auburn
come
in
every
sunday
more
than
a
mile
to
the
central
church
to
be
sure
deep
slumbers
settle
down
upon
them
as
soon
as
they
are
seated
which
continue
undisturbed
till
the
congregation
is
dismissed
but
they
have
done
their
best
and
who
can
doubt
that
they
receive
a
blessing
immediately
after
this
they
go
to
at
the
methodist
church
then
they
wait
for
a
third
service
and
after
that
start
out
home
again
footnote
f
this
was
written
in
the
year
and
the
old
people
both
lived
several
years
after
that
time
harriet
supposes
that
the
whole
family
were
actually
free
and
were
kept
wrongfully
in
a
state
of
slavery
all
those
long
years
but
she
simply
states
the
fact
without
any
mourning
or
lamenting
over
the
wrong
and
the
misery
of
it
all
accepting
it
as
the
will
of
god
and
therefore
not
to
be
rebelled
against
this
woman
of
whom
you
have
been
reading
is
now
old
and
feeble
suffering
from
the
effects
of
her
life
of
unusual
labor
and
hardship
as
well
as
from
repeated
injuries
but
she
is
still
at
work
for
her
people
for
many
years
even
long
before
the
war
her
little
home
has
been
the
refuge
of
the
hunted
and
the
homeless
for
whom
she
had
provided
and
i
have
seen
as
many
as
eight
or
ten
dependents
upon
her
care
at
one
time
living
there
it
has
always
been
a
hospital
but
she
feels
the
need
of
a
large
one
and
only
prays
to
see
this
her
last
work
completed
ere
she
goes
hence
without
claiming
any
of
my
dear
old
harriet
prophetic
vision
i
seem
to
see
a
future
day
when
the
wrongs
of
earth
will
be
righted
and
justice
long
delayed
will
assert
itself
i
seem
to
see
that
our
poor
harriet
has
passed
within
one
of
dem
gates
and
has
received
the
welcome
come
thou
blessed
of
my
father
for
i
was
hungry
and
you
gave
me
meat
i
was
thirsty
and
you
gave
me
drink
i
was
a
stranger
and
you
took
me
in
naked
and
you
clothed
me
sick
and
in
prison
and
you
visited
me
and
when
she
asks
lord
when
did
i
do
all
this
he
answers
inasmuch
as
you
did
it
unto
one
of
the
least
of
these
you
did
it
unto
me
and
as
she
stands
in
her
modest
way
just
within
the
celestial
gate
i
seem
to
see
a
kind
hand
laid
upon
her
dark
head
and
to
hear
a
gentle
voice
saying
in
her
ear
friend
come
up
higher
some
additional
incidents
in
the
life
of
harriet
the
story
of
this
remarkable
black
woman
has
been
attracting
renewed
interest
of
late
and
i
have
often
been
asked
to
publish
another
edition
of
the
book
and
to
add
some
interesting
and
amusing
incidents
which
i
have
related
to
my
friends
harriet
is
very
old
and
feeble
now
she
does
not
know
how
old
but
probably
between
eighty
and
ninety
her
years
of
toil
and
adventure
have
told
upon
her
and
she
may
not
last
much
longer
if
she
does
she
will
still
need
help
which
she
would
never
ask
for
herself
but
which
this
little
book
may
give
her
when
she
dies
it
may
aid
in
putting
up
a
fitting
monument
to
her
memory
which
should
always
be
kept
green
as
time
goes
on
the
horrors
of
the
days
of
slavery
are
by
many
forgotten
and
the
children
who
have
been
born
since
the
war
of
the
rebellion
know
of
that
fearful
straggle
and
of
the
causes
that
led
to
it
only
as
a
tradition
of
long
ago
even
in
the
city
where
harriet
has
so
long
lived
her
quiet
and
unobtrusive
life
it
is
not
an
uncommon
thing
to
meet
a
young
person
who
has
never
even
heard
her
name
those
who
know
the
principal
facts
of
her
eventful
history
may
be
interested
to
read
these
few
added
incidents
which
she
has
related
to
me
from
time
to
time
a
year
or
two
ago
as
i
was
staying
at
the
summer
home
of
my
brother
professor
hopkins
on
owasco
lake
harriet
came
up
to
see
us
it
was
after
lunch
and
my
brother
ordered
a
table
to
be
set
for
her
on
the
broad
shaded
piazza
and
waited
on
her
himself
bringing
her
cups
of
tea
and
other
good
things
as
if
it
were
a
pleasure
and
an
honor
to
serve
her
there
is
a
quiet
dignity
about
harriet
that
makes
her
superior
or
indifferent
to
all
surrounding
circumstances
whether
seated
at
the
hospitable
board
of
gerrit
smith
or
any
other
white
gentleman
as
she
often
was
or
sent
to
the
kitchen
where
the
white
domestics
refused
to
eat
with
a
nigger
it
was
all
the
same
to
harriet
she
was
never
elated
or
humiliated
she
took
everything
as
it
came
making
no
comments
or
complaints
and
so
she
sat
quietly
eating
her
lunch
and
talking
with
us
after
the
lunch
was
over
as
we
sat
on
the
piazza
waiting
for
the
steamboat
to
take
her
back
to
auburn
she
said
i
often
think
missus
of
things
i
wish
i
had
told
you
before
you
wrote
de
book
now
as
i
come
up
on

to
me
when

i
was

a
bowl
of
lumps
of
white
sugar
my
missus
got
into
a
great
quarrel
wid
her
husband
she
had
an
awful
temper
an
she
would
scole
an
storm

call
him
all
sorts
of
names
now
you
know
missus
i
never
had
nothing

by
me
did
look
so

an
my
missus
back

turned
to
me
while

passed
many
a
house
but
i
did
dar
to
stop
for
dey
all

my
missus
dey
would
send
me

an
by
when

big
dar

an
perhaps
eight

but
i
tumbled
ober
de
high
board
an
fell

on
de
ground
i
was
so

i
went

and
she
gave
you
an
awful
flogging
i
suppose
harriet
no
missus
but
did
this
was
all
that
was
said
but
probably
that
flogging
left
some
of
those
scars
which
cover
her
neck
and
back
to
this
day
think
of
a
poor
little
helpless
thing
seven
years
old
enduring
all
this
terror
and
suffering
and
yet
few
people
are
as
charitable
to
the
as
harriet
dey
don
know
no
better
missus
it
de
way
dey
was
brought
up
de
little
nigs
min
you
or
flog
was
what
was
said
to
de
chillen
and
dey
was
brought
up
wid
de
whip
in
der
hand
now
min
you
missus
dat
was
de
way
on
all
de
plantations
dere
was
good
marsters
an
missuses
as
i
heard
tell
but
i
did
happen
to
come
across
there
is
frequent
mention
made
in
the
memoir
of
harriet
firm
and
unwavering
trust
in
god
in
times
of
great
perplexity
or
deadly
peril
when
she
often
had
occasion
to
say
vain
is
the
help
of
man
but
in
god
is
my
help
i
have
never
known
another
instance
of
such
implicit
trust
and
confidence
very
soon
after
the
civil
war
her
house
was
turned
into
a
hospital
and
no
poor
helpless
creature
of
her
race
was
ever
turned
from
her
door
indeed
all
through
the
war
and
through
the
cruel
reign
of
the
fugitive
slave
law
her
house
was
one
of
the
depots
of
the
underground
railway
as
that
secret
and
unseen
mode
of
conveying
the
hunted
fugitives
was
called
and
when
the
war
was
over
she
established
a
hospital
which
for
many
years
indeed
till
she
was
too
ill
herself
to
take
charge
of
it
has
been
the
refuge
of
the
sufferers
of
her
race
who
had
no
earthly
dependence
but
harriet
very
often
this
woman
except
for
her
trust
in
de
lawd
had
had
no
idea
where
the
next
meal
was
to
come
from
but
she
troubled
herself
no
more
about
it
than
if
she
had
been
a
vanderbilt
or
an
astor
de
lawd
will
provide
was
her
motto
and
he
never
failed
her
one
day
in
passing
through
auburn
i
was
impelled
to
stop
over
a
train
and
drive
out
to
see
what
were
the
needs
of
my
colored
friend
and
to
take
her
some
supplies
her
little
house
was
always
neat
and
comfortable
and
the
small
parlor
was
nicely
and
rather
prettily
furnished
the
lame
the
halt
and
the
blind
the
bruised
and
crippled
little
children
and
one
crazy
woman
were
all
brought
in
to
see
me
and
the
blind
woman
she
seemed
to
have
no
other
name
a
very
old
woman
who
had
been
harriet
care
for
eighteen
years
was
led
into
the
room
an
interesting
and
pathetic
group
on
leaving
i
said
to
her
if
you
will
come
out
to
the
carriage
harriet
there
are
some
provisions
there
for
you
she
turned
to
one
of
her
poor
dependents
and
said
what
did
you
say
to
me
dis
mornin
you
said
had
got
nothin
to
eat
in
de
house
and
what
did
i
say
to
you
i
said
got
a
rich
father
nothing
that
comes
to
this
remarkable
woman
ever
surprises
her
she
says
very
little
in
the
way
of
thanks
except
to
the
giver
of
all
good
how
the
knowledge
comes
to
her
no
one
can
tell
but
she
seems
always
to
know
when
help
is
coming
and
she
is
generally
on
hand
to
receive
it
though
it
is
never
for
herself
she
wants
it
but
only
for
those
under
her
care
i
must
not
forget
to
mention
the
indian
girls
of
the
fort
wrangel
school
who
having
read
a
little
notice
of
harriet
in
the
evangelist
went
to
work
and
by
their
daily
labor
raised
dollars
which
they
sent
to
me
for
harriet
and
this
school
has
been
disbanded
and
these
educated
girls
have
been
sent
back
to
their
wretched
homes
because
our
government
could
not
afford
to
support
it
any
longer
pundita
ramabai
went
about
this
time
to
see
harriet
and
they
had
an
interesting
talk
together
here
was
a
remarkable
trio
taking
hold
of
hands
the
woman
from
east
india
the
indian
girl
from
the
far
west
and
the
black
woman
from
the
southern
states
only
two
removes
from
an
african
savage
once
when
she
came
to
new
york
where
she
had
not
been
in
twenty
years
and
was
starting
off
alone
to
find
some
friends
miles
away
in
a
part
of
the
city
which
she
had
never
seen
we
remonstrated
with
her
telling
her
she
would
surely
be
lost
now
missus
she
said
do
you
dis
ole
head
dat
done
de
navigatin
down
in
egypt
can
do
de
navigatin
up
here
in
new
york
and
she
walked
many
miles
scorning
a
cyar
and
found
all
the
people
she
wished
to
see
harriet
was
known
by
various
names
among
her
southern
friends
one
of
these
was
ole
chariot
perhaps
as
a
rhyme
to
the
name
by
which
they
called
her
and
so
often
when
she
went
to
bring
away
a
band
of
refugees
she
would
sing
as
she
walked
the
dark
country
roads
by
night
when
dat
ar
ole
chariot
comes
who
gwine
wid
me
and
from
some
unseen
singer
would
come
the
response
when
dat
ar
ole
chariot
comes
gwine
wid
you
and
by
some
wireless
telegraphy
known
only
to
the
initiated
it
would
be
made
known
in
one
cabin
or
another
where
their
deliverer
was
waiting
concealed
and
when
she
would
be
ready
to
pilot
them
on
their
long
journey
to
freedom
a
woman
suffrage
meeting
was
held
in
rochester
a
year
or
two
ago
and
harriet
came
to
attend
it
she
generally
attended
every
meeting
of
women
on
whatever
subject
if
possible
to
do
so
she
was
led
into
the
church
by
an
adopted
daughter
whom
she
had
rescued
from
death
when
a
baby
and
had
brought
up
as
her
own
the
church
was
warm
and
harriet
was
tired
and
soon
after
she
entered
deep
sleep
fell
upon
her
susan
anthony
and
stanton
were
on
the
platform
and
after
speeches
had
been
made
and
business
accomplished
one
of
these
ladies
said
friends
we
have
in
the
audience
that
wonderful
woman
harriet
tubman
from
whom
we
should
like
to
hear
if
she
will
kindly
come
to
the
platform
people
looked
around
at
harriet
but
harriet
was
fast
asleep
mother
mother
said
the
young
girl
they
are
calling
for
you
but
it
was
some
time
before
harriet
could
be
made
to
understand
where
she
was
or
what
was
wanted
of
her
at
length
she
was
led
out
into
the
aisle
and
was
assisted
by
one
of
these
kind
ladies
on
to
the
platform
harriet
looked
around
wondering
why
so
many
white
ladies
were
gathered
there
i
think
it
was
miss
anthony
who
led
her
forward
saying
ladies
i
am
glad
to
present
to
you
harriet
tubman
conductor
of
the
underground
railroad
yes
ladies
said
harriet
i
was
de
conductor
ob
de
underground
railroad
for
eight
years
an
i
can
say
what
mos
conductors
say
i
nebber
run
my
train
off
de
track
an
i
nebber
los
a
passenger
the
audience
laughed
and
applauded
and
harriet
was
emboldened
to
go
on
and
relate
portions
of
her
interesting
history
which
were
most
kindly
received
by
the
assembled
ladies
after
the
passage
of
the
iniquitous
fugitive
slave
law
harriet
removed
all
her
dependents
to
canada
and
here
john
brown
and
some
of
his
followers
took
refuge
with
her
and
she
was
his
helper
and
adviser
in
many
of
his
schemes
the
papers
of
that
time
tell
of
her
helping
him
with
his
plans
and
of
his
dependence
upon
her
judgment
in
one
of
his
letters
he
says
harriet
has
hitched
on
and
with
all
her
might
she
is
a
whole
team
for
this
large
party
added
to
her
own
family
of
several
persons
she
worked
day
and
night
in
her
usual
manner
her
old
father
and
mother
were
with
her
and
the
mother
nearly
a
hundred
years
old
and
enfeebled
in
mind
was
querulous
and
exacting
and
most
unreasonable
in
her
temper
often
reproaching
this
faithful
daughter
as
the
israelites
did
moses
of
old
for
bringing
them
up
into
the
wilderness
to
die
there
of
hunger
there
came
a
day
when
everything
eatable
was
exhausted
and
the
prospect
was
dark
indeed
the
old
mother
had
no
tobacco
and
no
tea
and
these
were
more
essential
to
her
comfort
than
food
or
clothing
then
reproaches
thick
and
fast
fell
upon
harriet
she
made
no
reply
but
went
into
her
closet
and
shut
the
door
when
she
came
out
she
had
a
large
basket
on
her
arm
catharine
she
said
take
off
dat
small
pot
an
put
on
a
large
one
but
harriet
der
ai
in
de
house
to
eat
put
on
de
large
pot
catharine
we
gwine
to
have
soup
and
harriet
started
for
the
market
the
day
was
nearly
over
and
the
were
anxious
to
be
rid
of
their
wares
and
were
offering
them
very
cheap
harriet
walked
along
with
the
basket
on
her
arm
old
woman
do
you
want
a
nice
piece
of
meat
called
out
one
and
another
here
a
nice
piece
only
ten
cents
take
this
you
can
have
it
for
five
cents
but
harriet
had
not
five
cents
at
length
a
butcher
judging
of
the
trouble
from
her
face
said
look
here
old
woman
you
look
like
an
honest
woman
take
this
and
pay
me
when
you
get
some
money
then
another
said
take
this
and
others
piled
on
pieces
of
meat
till
the
basket
was
full
harriet
passed
on
and
when
she
came
to
the
vegetables
she
exchanged
some
of
the
meat
for
potatoes
cabbage
and
onions
and
the
big
pot
was
in
requisition
when
she
reached
home
harriet
had
not
gone
into
her
closet
and
shut
the
door
for
nothing
i
hope
i
may
be
excused
for
sometimes
telling
my
story
in
the
first
person
as
i
can
not
conveniently
do
it
in
any
other
way
in
getting
ready
a
thanksgiving
box
to
send
to
harriet
a
few
years
ago
i
had
ordered
a
turkey
to
be
sent
for
it
but
as
the
weather
grew
quite
warm
i
was
advised
to
send
a
ham
instead
that
box
was
lost
for
three
weeks
and
when
i
saw
harriet
again
and
told
her
that
i
had
intended
to
send
a
turkey
in
it
she
said
wal
dere
was
a
clar
providence
in
dat
dere
missus
a
friend
hearing
that
i
was
preparing
a
christmas
box
in
new
york
for
this
needy
household
sent
me
a
quantity
of
clothing
and
ten
dollars
for
them
as
my
box
was
not
quite
full
i
expended
three
dollars
of
that
money
in
groceries
and
sent
seven
dollars
to
a
lady
in
auburn
who
acted
as
treasurer
for
harriet
giving
her
money
as
it
was
needed
for
harriet
heart
is
so
large
and
her
feelings
are
so
easily
wrought
upon
that
it
was
never
wise
to
give
her
more
than
enough
for
present
needs
not
long
after
i
received
a
letter
from
a
physician
a
woman
in
auburn
in
which
she
said
i
want
to
tell
you
something
about
harriet
she
came
to
me
last
friday
and
said
i
have
got
my
taxes
and
insurance
to
pay
and
i
have
a
cent
would
you
lend
me
seven
dollars
till
next
chuesday
more
to
try
her
than
anything
else
i
said
harriet
i
a
poor
woman
myself
how
do
you
know
you
pay
me
seven
dollars
next
tuesday
doctah
i
ca
jes
tell
you
how
but
i
pay
you
next
chuesday
on
tuesday
my
letter
with
seven
dollars
enclosed
arrived
in
auburn
and
harriet
took
the
money
to
the
friend
who
had
lent
it
to
her
others
thought
this
strange
but
there
was
nothing
strange
about
it
to
her
a
few
years
ago
when
harriet
called
on
the
writer
she
was
introduced
to
the
husband
of
one
of
her
daughters
lately
married
he
told
her
how
glad
he
was
to
see
her
as
he
had
heard
so
much
about
her
she
made
one
of
her
humble
courtesies
and
said
pleased
to
see
you
sir
it
de
first
time
i
hed
de
pleasure
makin
yo
since
you
was
into
my
when
the
turns
of
somnolence
come
upon
harriet
her
sperrit
as
she
says
goes
away
from
her
body
and
visits
other
scenes
and
places
and
if
she
ever
really
sees
them
afterwards
they
are
perfectly
familiar
to
her
and
she
can
find
her
way
about
alone
instances
of
this
kind
have
lately
been
mentioned
in
some
of
the
magazines
but
harriet
had
never
heard
of
them
sitting
in
her
house
one
day
deep
sleep
fell
upon
her
and
in
a
dream
or
vision
she
saw
a
chariot
in
the
air
going
south
and
empty
but
soon
it
returned
and
lying
in
it
cold
and
stiff
was
the
body
of
a
young
lady
of
whom
harriet
was
very
fond
whose
home
was
in
auburn
but
who
had
gone
to
washington
with
her
father
a
distinguished
officer
of
the
government
there
g
footnote
g
william
h
seward
the
shock
roused
harriet
from
her
sleep
and
she
ran
into
auburn
to
the
house
of
her
minister
crying
out
oh
miss
fanny
is
dead
and
the
news
had
just
been
received
she
woke
from
a
sleep
one
day
in
great
agitation
and
ran
to
the
houses
of
her
colored
neighbors
exclaiming
that
a
drefful
was
happenin
somewha
de
ground
was
openin
an
de
houses
were
fallin
in
and
de
people
bein
killed
faster
dey
was
in
de
wah
faster
dey
was
in
de
wah
at
that
very
time
or
near
it
an
earthquake
was
occurring
in
the
northern
part
of
south
america
for
the
telegram
came
that
day
though
why
a
vision
of
it
should
be
sent
to
harriet
no
one
can
divine
her
expressions
are
often
very
peculiar
some
ladies
of
a
certain
church
who
had
become
interested
in
her
wished
to
see
her
and
she
was
invited
to
come
to
their
city
and
attended
the
sewing
circle
where
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
were
gathered
together
they
asked
her
many
questions
and
she
told
stories
sang
songs
danced
and
imitated
the
talk
of
the
southern
negroes
and
went
away
loaded
with
many
tokens
of
the
kind
interest
of
these
ladies
on
the
way
home
she
said
what
nice
ladies
dem
was
missus
i
looked
in
all
dere
faces
an
i
did
see
nothin
venomous
in
one
of
as
has
been
said
harriet
can
neither
read
nor
write
her
letters
are
all
written
by
an
amanuensis
and
she
seems
to
have
an
idea
that
by
laying
her
hand
on
this
person
her
feelings
may
be
transmitted
to
the
one
to
whom
she
is
writing
these
feelings
are
sometimes
very
poetically
expressed
i
have
by
me
some
of
those
letters
in
one
of
them
she
says
i
lay
my
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
writer
of
this
letter
and
i
wish
for
you
and
all
your
offsprings
a
through
ticket
in
the
gospel
train
to
glory
in
another
letter
she
has
dictated
this
sentence
i
ask
of
my
heavenly
father
that
when
the
last
trump
sounds
and
my
name
is
called
i
may
stand
close
by
your
side
to
answer
to
the
call
probably
many
of
her
friends
and
correspondents
might
contribute
facts
and
incidents
in
harriet
life
quite
as
interesting
as
any
i
have
mentioned
but
i
have
no
way
of
getting
at
them
harriet
had
long
cherished
the
idea
of
having
her
hospital
incorporated
and
placed
in
charge
of
the
zion
african
methodist
church
of
auburn
and
she
was
particularly
anxious
to
come
into
possession
of
a
lot
of
acres
of
land
near
her
own
home
to
present
to
it
as
a
little
farm
this
lot
was
to
be
sold
at
auction
and
on
the
day
of
the
sale
harriet
appeared
with
a
very
little
money
and
a
determination
to
have
the
land
cost
what
it
might
dey
was
all
white
folks
but
me
dere
missus
and
dere
i
was
like
a
blackberry
in
a
pail
ob
milk
but
i
hid
down
in
a
corner
and
no
one
know
who
was
biddin
de
man
began
down
pretty
low
and
i
kept
goin
up
by
fifties
he
got
up
to
twelve
hundred
thirteen
hundred
fourteen
hundred
and
still
dat
voice
in
the
corner
kept
goin
up
by
fifties
at
last
it
got
up
to
fourteen
hundred
and
fifty
an
den
oders
stopped
biddin
an
de
man
said
done
who
is
de
buyer
tubman
i
shouted
dat
ole
nigger
dey
said
woman
how
you
ebber
gwine
to
pay
fer
dat
lot
ob
land
gwine
home
to
tell
de
lawd
jesus
all
about
it
i
said
after
telling
the
lord
jesus
all
about
it
harriet
went
down
to
a
bank
obtained
the
money
by
mortgaging
the
land
and
then
requested
to
have
a
deed
made
out
making
the
land
over
to
the
zion
african
methodist
church
and
her
mind
is
easy
about
her
hospital
though
with
many
persons
the
trouble
would
be
but
just
beginning
as
there
is
interest
on
the
mortgage
to
be
paid
though
the
hospital
is
no
longer
on
her
hands
you
will
never
find
her
without
several
poor
creatures
under
her
care
when
i
last
saw
her
she
was
providing
for
five
sick
and
injured
ones
a
blind
woman
came
one
day
to
her
door
led
by
four
little
children
her
husband
had
turned
her
out
of
his
house
and
like
all
other
poor
distressed
black
people
who
could
get
there
she
made
her
way
to
harriet
before
the
next
morning
a
fifth
was
added
to
the
group
as
soon
as
it
was
possible
harriet
dressed
the
whole
six
in
white
and
took
them
to
a
methodist
church
and
had
them
baptized
a
little
account
of
this
was
sent
to
the
evangelist
and
the
almost
immediate
response
was
dollars
which
was
of
great
benefit
in
providing
for
the
needs
of
the
growing
family
this
faithful
creature
will
probably
not
live
much
longer
and
her
like
will
not
be
seen
again
but
through
the
sale
of
the
last
edition
of
her
memoir
and
some
other
sources
of
income
her
wants
will
be
abundantly
supplied
harriet
friends
will
be
glad
to
learn
that
she
has
lately
been
for
some
time
in
boston
where
a
surgical
operation
was
performed
upon
her
head
the
skull
which
was
crushed
by
a
weight
thrown
by
her
master
more
than
seventy
years
before
being
successfully
raised
harriet
account
of
this
operation
is
rather
amusing

new
lease
of
life

say

very
feeble

much
longer
her
through
ticket

long
been
ready
for
her
and
when
her
last
journey
is
accomplished

we
doubt
that
she
will
be
welcomed
to

of
those
many
mansions
prepared
for
those
who

spent
their
lives

dear
madame
i
am
happy
to
learn
that
you
are
to
speak
to
the
public
of
harriet
tubman
of
the
remarkable
events
of
her
life
i
have
no
knowledge
but
of
the
truth
of
them
as
she
describes
them
i
have
no
doubt
i
have
often
listened
to
her
in
her
visits
to
my
family
and
i
am
confident
that
she
is
not
only
truthful
but
that
she
has
a
rare
discernment
and
a
deep
and
sublime
philanthropy
with
great
respect
your
friend
gerrit
smith
from
wendell
dear
madame
the
last
time
i
ever
saw
john
brown
was
under
my
own
roof
as
he
brought
harriet
tubman
to
me
saying
phillips
i
bring
you
one
of
the
best
and
bravest
persons
on
this
continent
tubman
as
we
call
her
he
then
went
on
to
recount
her
labors
and
sacrifices
in
behalf
of
her
race
after
that
harriet
spent
some
time
in
boston
earning
the
confidence
and
admiration
of
all
those
who
were
working
for
freedom
with
their
aid
she
went
to
the
south
more
than
once
returning
always
with
a
squad
of
men
women
and
children
for
whom
her
marvelous
skill
had
opened
the
way
of
escape
after
the
war
broke
out
she
was
sent
with
indorsements
from
governor
andrew
and
his
friends
to
south
carolina
where
in
the
service
of
the
nation
she
rendered
most
important
and
efficient
aid
to
our
army
in
my
opinion
there
are
few
captains
perhaps
few
colonels
who
have
done
more
for
the
loyal
cause
since
the
war
began
and
few
men
who
did
before
that
time
more
for
the
colored
race
than
our
fearless
and
most
sagacious
friend
harriet
faithfully
yours
wendell
phillips
from
frederick
rochester
dear
harriet
i
am
glad
to
know
that
the
story
of
your
eventful
life
has
been
written
by
a
kind
lady
and
that
the
same
is
soon
to
be
published
you
ask
for
what
you
do
not
need
when
you
call
upon
me
for
a
word
of
commendation
i
need
such
words
from
you
far
more
than
you
can
need
them
from
me
especially
where
your
superior
labors
and
devotion
to
the
cause
of
the
lately
enslaved
of
our
land
are
known
as
i
know
them
the
difference
between
us
is
very
marked
most
that
i
have
done
and
suffered
in
the
service
of
our
cause
has
been
in
public
and
i
have
received
much
encouragement
at
every
step
of
the
way
you
on
the
other
hand
have
labored
in
a
private
way
i
have
wrought
in
the
day
you
in
the
night
i
have
had
the
applause
of
the
crowd
and
the
satisfaction
that
comes
of
being
approved
by
the
multitude
while
the
most
that
you
have
done
has
been
witnessed
by
a
few
trembling
scarred
and
bondmen
and
women
whom
you
have
led
out
of
the
house
of
bondage
and
whose
heartfelt
bless
has
been
your
only
reward
the
midnight
sky
and
the
silent
stars
have
been
the
witnesses
of
your
devotion
to
freedom
and
of
your
heroism
excepting
john
brown
of
sacred
memory
i
know
of
no
one
who
has
willingly
encountered
more
perils
and
hardships
to
serve
our
enslaved
people
than
you
have
much
that
you
have
done
would
seem
improbable
to
those
who
do
not
know
you
as
i
know
you
it
is
to
me
a
great
pleasure
and
a
great
privilege
to
bear
testimony
to
your
character
and
your
works
and
to
say
to
those
to
whom
you
may
come
that
i
regard
you
in
every
way
truthful
and
trustworthy
your
friend
frederick
douglass
from
a
letter
written
by
sanborn
secretary
of
the
massachusetts
board
of
state
my
dear
madame
phillips
has
sent
me
your
note
asking
for
reminiscences
of
harriet
tubman
and
testimonials
to
her
extraordinary
story
which
all
her
new
england
friends
will
i
am
sure
be
glad
to
furnish
i
never
had
reason
to
doubt
the
truth
of
what
harriet
said
in
regard
to
her
own
career
for
i
found
her
singularly
truthful
her
imagination
is
warm
and
rich
and
there
is
a
whole
region
of
the
marvelous
in
her
nature
which
has
manifested
itself
at
times
remarkably
her
dreams
and
visions
misgivings
and
forewarnings
ought
not
to
be
omitted
in
any
life
of
her
particularly
those
relating
to
john
brown
she
was
in
his
confidence
in
and
he
had
a
great
regard
for
her
which
he
often
expressed
to
me
she
aided
him
in
his
plans
and
expected
to
do
so
still
further
when
his
career
was
closed
by
that
wonderful
campaign
in
virginia
the
first
time
she
came
to
my
house
in
concord
after
that
tragedy
she
was
shown
into
a
room
in
the
evening
where
brackett
bust
of
john
brown
was
standing
the
sight
of
it
which
was
new
to
her
threw
her
into
a
sort
of
ecstacy
of
sorrow
and
admiration
and
she
went
on
in
her
rhapsodical
way
to
pronounce
his
apotheosis
she
has
often
been
in
concord
where
she
resided
at
the
houses
of
emerson
alcott
the
whitneys
the
brooks
family
horace
mann
and
other
persons
they
all
admired
and
respected
her
and
nobody
doubted
the
reality
of
her
adventures
she
was
too
a
person
to
be
suspected
in
i
think
it
was
she
went
from
boston
to
port
royal
under
the
advice
and
encouragement
of
garrison
governor
andrew
howe
and
other
leading
people
her
career
in
south
carolina
is
well
known
to
some
of
our
officers
and
i
think
to
colonel
higginson
now
of
newport
and
colonel
james
montgomery
of
kansas
to
both
of
whom
she
was
useful
as
a
spy
and
guide
if
i
mistake
not
i
regard
her
as
on
the
whole
the
most
extraordinary
person
of
her
race
i
have
ever
met
she
is
a
negro
of
pure
or
almost
pure
blood
can
neither
read
nor
write
and
has
the
characteristics
of
her
race
and
condition
but
she
has
done
what
can
scarcely
be
credited
on
the
best
authority
and
she
has
accomplished
her
purposes
with
a
coolness
foresight
patience
and
wisdom
which
in
a
would
have
raised
him
to
the
highest
pitch
of
reputation
i
am
dear
madame
very
truly

believes
she
has
a
claim
for
faithful
services
to
the
command
in
south
carolina
with

you

she
thinks
that
you
would
be
disposed

see
her
claim
justly
settled

nobler
higher

mentioning
the
case
of
an
old
slave
mother
whom
he
vainly
endeavored
to
assist
her
son
in
buying
from
her
master
says
i
did
not
until
four
years
after
know
that
remarkable
woman
harriet
or
i
might
have
engaged
her
services
in
the
assurance
that
she
would
have
bought
off
the
old
woman
without
for
her
inalienable
right
her
liberty
may
in
another
place
says
of
harriet
that
she
deserves
to
be
placed
on
the
list
of
american
heroines
and
then
proceeds
to
give
a
short
account
of
her
labors
varying
very
little
from
that
given
in
this
book
fugitive
slave
rescue
in
troy
from
the
april
yesterday
afternoon
the
streets
of
this
city
and
west
troy
were
made
the
scenes
of
unexampled
excitement
for
the
first
time
since
the
passage
of
the
fugitive
slave
law
an
attempt
was
made
here
to
carry
its
provisions
into
execution
and
the
result
was
a
terrific
encounter
between
the
officers
and
the
prisoner
friends
the
triumph
of
mob
law
and
the
final
rescue
of
the
fugitive
our
city
was
thrown
into
a
grand
state
of
turmoil
and
for
a
time
every
other
topic
was
forgotten
to
give
place
to
this
new
excitement
people
did
not
think
last
evening
to
ask
who
was
nominated
at
charleston
or
whether
the
news
of
the
heenan
and
sayers
battle
had
arrived
everything
was
merged
into
the
fugitive
slave
case
of
which
it
seems
the
end
is
not
yet
charles
nalle
the
fugitive
who
was
the
cause
of
all
this
excitement
was
a
slave
on
the
plantation
of
hansborough
in
culpepper
county
virginia
till
the
of
october
when
he
made
his
escape
and
went
to
live
in
columbia
pennsylvania
a
wife
and
five
children
are
residing
there
now
not
long
since
he
came
to
sandlake
in
this
county
and
resided
in
the
family
of
crosby
until
about
three
weeks
ago
since
that
time
he
has
been
employed
as
coachman
by
uri
gilbert
of
this
city
he
is
about
thirty
years
of
age
tall
quite
and
he
is
said
to
have
been
an
excellent
and
faithful
servant
at
sandlake
we
understand
that
nalle
was
often
seen
by
one
averill
formerly
connected
with
one
of
the
papers
of
this
city
who
communicated
with
his
reputed
owner
in
virginia
and
gave
the
information
that
led
to
a
knowledge
of
the
whereabouts
of
the
fugitive
averill
wrote
letters
for
him
and
thus
obtained
an
acquaintance
with
his
history
hansborough
sent
on
an
agent
henry
j
wall
by
whom
the
necessary
papers
were
got
out
to
arrest
the
fugitive
yesterday
morning
about
charles
nalle
was
sent
to
procure
some
bread
for
the
family
by
whom
he
was
employed
he
failed
to
return
at
the
baker
he
was
arrested
by
deputy
united
states
marshal
holmes
and
immediately
taken
before
united
states
commissioner
miles
beach
the
son
of
gilbert
thinking
it
strange
that
he
did
not
come
back
sent
to
the
house
of
william
henry
on
division
street
where
he
boarded
and
his
whereabouts
was
discovered
the
examination
before
commissioner
beach
was
quite
brief
the
evidence
of
averill
and
the
agent
was
taken
and
the
commissioner
decided
to
remand
nalle
to
virginia
the
necessary
papers
were
made
out
and
given
to
the
marshal
by
this
time
it
was
two
and
the
fact
began
to
be
noised
abroad
that
there
was
a
fugitive
slave
in
beach
office
corner
of
state
and
first
streets
people
in
knots
of
ten
or
twelve
collected
near
the
entrance
looking
at
nalle
who
could
be
seen
at
an
upper
window
william
henry
a
colored
man
with
whom
nalle
boarded
commenced
talking
from
the
in
a
loud
voice
to
the
crowd
he
uttered
such
sentences
as
there
is
a
fugitive
slave
in
that
office
pretty
soon
you
will
see
him
come
forth
he
is
going
to
be
taken
down
south
and
you
will
have
a
chance
to
see
him
he
is
to
be
taken
to
the
depot
to
go
to
virginia
in
the
first
train
keep
watch
of
those
stairs
and
you
will
have
a
sight
a
number
of
women
kept
shouting
crying
and
by
loud
appeals
excited
the
colored
persons
assembled
still
the
crowd
grew
in
numbers
wagons
halted
in
front
of
the
locality
and
were
soon
piled
with
spectators
an
alarm
of
fire
was
sounded
and
hose
carriages
dashed
through
the
ranks
of
men
women
and
boys
but
they
closed
again
and
kept
looking
with
expectant
eyes
at
the
window
where
the
negro
was
visible
meanwhile
angry
discussions
commenced
some
persons
agitated
a
rescue
and
others
favored
law
and
order
brockway
a
lawyer
had
his
coat
torn
for
expressing
his
sentiments
and
other
kept
the
interest
alive
all
at
once
there
was
a
wild
halloo
and
every
eye
was
turned
up
to
see
the
legs
and
part
of
the
body
of
the
prisoner
protruding
from
the
second
story
window
at
which
he
was
endeavoring
to
escape
then
arose
a
shout
drop
him
catch
him
hurrah
but
the
attempt
was
a
fruitless
one
for
somebody
in
the
office
pulled
nalle
back
again
amid
the
shouts
of
a
hundred
pairs
of
lungs
the
crowd
at
this
time
numbered
nearly
a
thousand
persons
many
of
them
were
black
and
a
good
share
were
of
the
female
sex
they
blocked
up
state
street
from
first
street
to
the
alley
and
kept
surging
to
and
fro
martin
townsend
who
acted
as
counsel
for
the
fugitive
did
not
arrive
in
the
commissioner
office
until
a
decision
had
been
rendered
he
immediately
went
before
judge
gould
of
the
supreme
court
and
procured
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
usual
form
immediately
this
was
given
nathaniel
upham
who
at
once
proceeded
to
commissioner
office
and
served
it
on
holmes
very
injudiciously
the
officers
proceeded
at
once
to
judge
gould
office
although
it
was
evident
they
would
have
to
pass
through
an
excited
unreasonable
crowd
as
soon
as
the
officers
and
their
prisoner
emerged
from
the
door
an
old
negro
who
had
been
standing
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
shouted
here
they
come
and
the
crowd
made
a
terrific
rush
at
the
party
from
the
office
of
commissioner
beach
in
the
mutual
building
to
that
of
judge
gould
in
congress
street
is
less
than
two
blocks
but
it
was
made
a
regular
battlefield
the
moment
the
prisoner
emerged
from
the
doorway
in
custody
of
upham
chief
of
police
quin
officers
cleveland
and
holmes
the
crowd
made
one
grand
charge
and
those
nearest
the
prisoner
seized
him
violently
with
the
intention
of
pulling
him
away
from
the
officers
but
they
were
foiled
and
down
first
to
congress
street
and
up
the
latter
in
front
of
judge
gould
chambers
went
the
surging
mass
exactly
what
did
go
on
in
the
crowd
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
the
pulling
hauling
mauling
and
shouting
gave
evidences
of
frantic
efforts
on
the
part
of
the
rescuers
and
a
stern
resistance
from
the
conservators
of
the
law
in
front
of
judge
gould
office
the
combat
was
at
its
height
no
stones
or
other
missiles
were
used
the
battle
was
fist
to
fist
we
believe
an
order
was
given
to
take
the
prisoner
the
other
way
and
there
was
a
grand
rush
towards
the
west
past
first
and
river
streets
as
far
as
dock
street
all
this
time
there
was
a
continual
many
of
the
officers
were
hurt
among
them
upham
whose
object
was
solely
to
do
his
duty
by
taking
nalle
before
judge
gould
in
accordance
with
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
a
number
in
the
crowd
were
more
or
less
hurt
and
it
is
a
wonder
that
these
were
not
badly
injured
as
pistols
were
drawn
and
chisels
used
the
battle
had
raged
as
far
as
the
corner
of
dock
and
congress
streets
and
the
victory
remained
with
the
rescuers
at
last
the
officers
were
completely
worn
out
with
their
exertions
and
it
was
impossible
to
continue
their
hold
upon
him
any
longer
nalle
was
at
liberty
his
friends
rushed
him
down
dock
street
to
the
lower
ferry
where
there
was
a
skiff
lying
ready
to
start
the
fugitive
was
put
in
the
ferryman
rowed
off
and
amid
the
shouts
of
hundreds
who
lined
the
banks
of
the
river
nalle
was
carried
into
albany
county
as
the
skiff
landed
in
west
troy
a
negro
sympathizer
waded
up
to
the
waist
and
pulled
nalle
out
of
the
boat
he
went
up
the
hill
alone
however
and
there
who
should
he
meet
but
constable
becker
the
latter
official
seeing
a
man
with
manacles
on
considered
it
his
duty
to
arrest
him
he
did
so
and
took
him
in
a
wagon
to
the
office
of
justice
stewart
on
the
second
floor
of
the
corner
building
near
the
ferry
the
justice
was
absent
when
the
crowd
on
the
troy
bank
had
seen
nalle
safely
landed
it
was
suggested
that
he
might
be
recaptured
then
there
was
another
rush
made
for
the
steam
which
carried
over
about
persons
and
left
as
many
more
a
few
of
the
latter
being
soused
in
their
efforts
to
get
on
the
boat
on
landing
in
west
troy
there
sure
enough
was
the
prisoner
locked
up
in
a
strong
office
protected
by
officers
becker
brown
and
morrison
and
the
door
barricaded
not
a
moment
was
lost
up
stairs
went
a
score
or
more
of
resolute
men
the
rest
piling
in
promiscuously
shouting
and
execrating
the
officers
soon
a
stone
flew
against
the
door
then
another
and
bang
bang
went
off
a
couple
of
pistols
but
the
officers
who
fired
them
took
good
care
to
aim
pretty
high
the
assailants
were
forced
to
retreat
for
a
moment
they
got
pistols
said
one
who
cares
was
the
reply
they
can
only
kill
a
dozen
of
us
come
on
more
stones
and
more
ensued
at
last
the
door
was
pulled
open
by
an
immense
negro
and
in
a
moment
he
was
felled
by
a
hatchet
in
the
hands
of
morrison
but
the
body
of
the
fallen
man
blocked
up
the
door
so
that
it
could
not
be
shut
and
a
friend
of
the
prisoner
pulled
him
out
poor
fellow
he
might
well
say
save
me
from
my
friends
amid
the
pulling
and
hauling
the
iron
had
cut
his
arms
which
were
bleeding
profusely
and
he
could
hardly
walk
owing
to
fatigue
he
has
since
arrived
safely
in
canada
the
end
