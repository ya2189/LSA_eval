foreword
if
lady
duff
from
the
are
less
familiar
to
the
present
generation
of
readers
than
those
of
the
lady
anne
barnard
the
neglect
is
due
in
great
part
to
the
circumstances
of
their
publication
after
appearing
in
a
miscellany
of
victorian
travel
third
series
where
their
simplicity
and
delicate
unprofessional
candour
gave
them
a
brief
hour
of
public
esteem
they
were
first
issued
separately
as
a
supplement
to
lady
duff
letters
from
occupying
the
latter
portion
of
a
volume
to
which
the
daughter
ross
contributed
a
short
but
vivid
memoir
which
touched
but
lightly
on
her
south
african
experiences
and
they
have
never
appeared
we
believe
in
any
other
form
yet
they
are
inferior
in
nothing
but
political
interest
to
those
of
the
authoress
of
robin
indeed
in
her
intellectual
equipment
her
temperament
and
her
gift
of
style
lady
duff
gordon
was
a
far
rarer
creature
than
the
jovial
and
managing
scotswoman
who
was
the
correspondent
of
dundas
and
in
human
quality
that
has
kept
lady
anne
letters
duff
gordon
shows
a
still
wider
range
and
a
yet
keener
sensibility
her
letters
are
the
fine
flower
of
the
english
epistolary
literature
of
the
cape
few
books
of
their
class
have
better
deserved
reprinting
the
daughter
of
john
and
sarah
austin
ran
every
risk
of
growing
up
a
yet
she
escaped
every
danger
of
the
proximity
of
bentham
her
childish
friendships
with
henry
reeve
and
the
mills
and
the
formidable
presence
of
the
learned
friends
of
both
her
the
force
of
a
triumphant
naturalness
and
humour
which
remained
with
her
to
the
end
of
her
life
although
her
schooling
was
in
germany
and
her
sympathy
with
german
character
was
remarkable
her
own
personality
was
rather
french
in
its
grace
and
gaiety
it
was
characteristic
of
her
then
to
defend
as
she
did
vieille
gaiet√©
against
heine
on
his
but
the
truth
is
that
her
sympathies
were
nearly
perfect
she
was
one
of
those
rare
characters
that
see
the
best
in
every
nationality
without
aping
cosmopolitanism
simply
because
they
are
content
everywhere
to
be
human
convention
and
prejudice
vex
them
as
little
as
pedantry
can
their
clear
eyes
look
out
each
morning
on
a
fresh
world
and
their
experiences
are
a
perpetual
school
of
sympathy
and
never
the
sad
routine
of
disillusionment
when
lady
duff
gordon
came
to
the
cape
in
search
of
health
in
she
brought
with
her
young
though
she
was
a
wealth
of
recollection
and
experience
such
as
perhaps
no
other
observer
of
south
africa
has
known
she
had
been
the
friend
of
nearly
every
prominent
from
rogers
to
tennyson
she
was
intimate
with
half
the
intellectual
world
of
england
and
germany
and
admired
for
her
beauty
and
grace
of
character
in
the
salons
of
paris
as
much
as
in
the
of
london
and
she
had
shown
the
quality
of
her
womanly
sympathy
in
the
most
famous
of
her
literary
friendships
that
with
heinrich
heine
when
she
visited
the
poet
and
soothed
him
in
his
last
sad
days
in
episode
perhaps
better
known
to
readers
from
story
of
mattrass
than
in
the
moving
narrative
of
lady
duff
gordon
herself
on
which
the
story
is
based
it
was
into
the
little
world
of
caledon
and
simonstown
and
worcester
drowsy
villages
of
the
old
cape
town
had
little
attraction
for
her
and
the
climate
proved
this
rare
and
exquisite
being
descended
but
the
test
of
the
true
the
of
genius
is
the
skill
and
ease
with
which
he
brings
variety
out
of
seeming
monotony
the
letters
of
lady
duff
gordon
answer
this
test
she
had
not
been
many
days
in
the
country
before
she
had
discovered
if
she
required
to
discover
the
excellent
principle
in
dealing
with
the
and
by
the
time
she
reaches
caledon
she
is
on
the
best
of
terms
with
her
new
friends
postmaster
heer
klein
and
his
old
pylades
heer
ley
are
great
cronies
of
old
toddling
down
the
hill
together
i
sometimes
go
and
sit
on
the
stoep
with
the
two
old
bachelors
and
they
take
it
as
a
great
compliment
and
heer
klein
gave
me
my
letters
all
decked
with
flowers
and
wished
tydings
most
she
has
a
keen
eye
for
the
fine
shades
of
national
character
and
the
modifications
that
spring
from
differences
of
upbringing
the
english
farmer
in
the
young
dutch
doctor
with
english
manners
the
german
wife
in
cape
town
a
whole
chapter
might
be
written
on
her
friendship
with
the
malays
whose
hearts
she
won
as
completely
as
she
afterwards
did
those
of
their
mohammedan
brothers
in
egypt
ian
colvin
has
since
opened
up
afresh
the
field
she
was
here
almost
the
first
to
survey
in
another
direction
in
her
remarks
on
the
eastern
province
jew
of
lady
duff
gordon
has
given
us
some
notes
which
are
of
distinct
value
for
social
history
the
following
passage
for
example
deserves
to
be
quoted
as
a
de
in
the
evolution
of
a
type
colonial
the
a
new
to
me
they
have
the
features
of
their
race
but
many
of
their
peculiarities
are
gone
who
is
very
handsome
and
gentlemanly
eats
ham
and
patronises
a
good
breed
of
pigs
on
the
on
which
he
spends
his
money
he
is
he
says
a
thorough
jew
in
faith
and
evidently
in
charitable
works
but
he
wants
to
say
his
prayers
in
english
and
not
to
himself
in
a
veil
and
phylacteries
for
the
purpose
and
he
and
his
wife
talk
of
england
as
and
care
as
much
for
jerusalem
as
their
neighbours
they
have
not
forgotten
the
old
persecutions
and
are
civil
to
the
coloured
people
and
speak
of
them
in
quite
a
different
tone
from
other
english
colonists
moreover
they
are
far
better
mannered
and
more
in
the
german
sense
of
the
word
in
all
respects
in
short
less
it
was
a
lady
of
this
party
who
described
prince
funeral
to
lady
duff
gordon
people
mourned
for
much
as
for
hezekiah
and
indeed
he
deserved
it
a
great
deal
there
is
not
much
attempt
to
describe
scenery
in
lady
duff
letters
but
just
enough
to
show
that
her
eye
was
as
sensitive
to
landscape
as
to
the
shades
of
racial
character
and
feeling
she
indicates
delicately
yet
effectively
the
difference
between
the
atmosphere
at
the
coast
and
that
inland
is
the
difference
between
a
pretty
pompadour
beauty
and
a
greek
statue
those
pale
opal
mountains
as
distinct
in
every
detail
as
the
map
on
your
table
and
so
cheerful
and
serene
no
melodramatic
effects
of
clouds
and
but
as
a
rule
it
is
the
human
pageant
that
engrosses
her
and
here
her
sense
of
values
is
extraordinarily
keen
there
is
no
better
instance
than
the
portrait
of
the
german
wife
who
confided
to
the
writer
her
timidity
on
landing
in
africa
had
out
of
the
city
of
berlin
and
knew
she
spoke
of
the
natives
as
and
lady
duff
comment
is
use
of
the
word
was
characteristic
she
could
recognize
an
not
of
but
one
might
quote
from
every
second
page
of
these
letters
lady
duff
gordon
was
less
than
a
year
in
south
africa
but
in
that
time
she
brought
more
happiness
to
those
around
her
than
many
have
done
in
a
lifetime
and
her
bounties
live
after
her
a
last
remark
may
not
be
out
of
place
here
although
it
will
doubtless
occur
to
every
reader
who
approaches
these
letters
with
sympathy
and
discretion
they
must
be
read
as
true
letters
and
the
spontaneous
delineation
of
a
personality
and
not
as
a
considered
contribution
to
south
african
history
freer
even
than
stevenson
himself
from
romantisme
des
and
singularly
in
all
that
comes
under
her
personal
observation
lady
duff
gordon
does
not
wholly
escape
the
nemesis
which
overtakes
the
traveller
who
accepts
his
history
from
hearsay
and
in
south
africa
as
we
know
such
nemesis
is
unfailing
few
however
have
been
the
travellers
as
the
following
pages
will
show
who
could
meet
such
a
charge
with
so
great
evidence
of
candour
disinterestedness
and
love
of
human
nature
in
its
simplest
and
most
innocent
forms
introductory
the
following
letters
were
written
as
the
reader
will
readily
perceive
without
the
remotest
view
to
publication
they
convey
in
the
most
unreserved
manner
the
fresh
and
vivid
impressions
of
the
moment
to
the
two
persons
with
whom
of
all
others
the
writer
felt
the
least
necessity
for
reserve
in
the
expression
of
her
thoughts
or
care
about
the
form
in
which
those
thoughts
were
conveyed
such
letters
can
not
be
expected
to
be
free
from
mistakes
the
writer
is
misinformed
or
her
imagination
powerfully
acted
upon
by
new
and
strange
objects
colours
and
magnifies
to
a
certain
extent
what
she
sees
if
these
are
valid
objections
they
are
equally
so
to
every
description
of
a
country
that
has
not
been
corrected
by
long
experience
it
has
been
thought
however
that
their
obvious
and
absolute
genuineness
and
a
certain
frank
and
originality
hardly
to
be
found
in
what
is
written
for
the
public
would
recommend
them
to
the
taste
of
many
but
this
was
not
the
strongest
motive
to
their
publication
the
tone
of
english
travellers
is
too
frequently
arrogant
and
contemptuous
even
towards
peoples
whose
pretensions
on
the
score
of
civilization
are
little
inferior
to
their
own
when
they
come
in
contact
with
communities
or
races
inferior
to
them
in
natural
organization
or
in
acquired
advantages
the
feeling
of
a
common
humanity
often
seems
entirely
to
disappear
no
attempt
is
made
to
search
out
under
external
differences
the
proofs
of
a
common
nature
no
attempt
to
trace
the
streams
of
human
affections
in
their
course
through
channels
unlike
those
marked
out
among
ourselves
no
attempt
to
discover
what
there
may
be
of
good
mingled
with
obvious
evil
or
concealed
under
appearances
which
excite
our
surprise
and
antipathy
it
is
the
entire
absence
of
the
exclusive
and
supercilious
spirit
which
characterizes
dominant
races
the
rare
power
of
entering
into
new
trains
of
thought
and
sympathizing
with
unaccustomed
feelings
the
tender
pity
for
the
feeble
and
subject
and
the
courteous
respect
for
their
prejudices
the
large
and
purely
human
sympathies
far
more
than
any
literary
or
graphic
merits
are
the
qualities
which
have
induced
the
possessors
of
the
few
following
letters
to
give
them
to
the
public
they
show
what
a
series
of
letters
from
egypt
since
received
from
the
same
writer
prove
yet
more
conclusively
that
even
among
barbarians
are
to
be
found
hearts
that
open
to
every
touch
of
kindness
and
respond
to
every
expression
of
respect
and
sympathy
if
they
should
awaken
any
sentiments
like
those
which
inspired
them
on
behalf
of
races
of
men
who
come
in
contact
with
civilization
only
to
feel
its
resistless
force
and
its
haughty
indifference
or
contempt
it
will
be
some
consolation
to
those
who
are
enduring
the
bitterness
of
the
separation
to
which
they
owe
their
existence

i
the
voyage
wednesday
july
off
the
scilly
isles
when
i
wrote
last
sunday
we
put
our
pilot
on
shore
and
went
down
channel
it
soon
came
on
to
blow
and
all
night
was
squally
and
rough
captain
on
deck
all
night
monday
i
went
on
deck
at
eight
lovely
weather
but
the
ship
pitching
as
you
never
saw
a
ship
under
water
by
two
a
gale
came
on
all
ordered
below
captain
left
dinner
and
about
six
a
sea
struck
us
on
the
weather
side
and
washed
a
good
many
unconsidered
trifles
overboard
and
stove
in
three
windows
on
the
poop
nurse
and
four
children
in
fits
and
babies
afloat
but
as
usual
and
i
picked
up
children
and
bullied
nurse
and
helped
to
bale
cabin
cuddy
window
stove
in
and
we
were
wetted
went
to
bed
at
nine
could
not
undress
it
pitched
so
and
had
to
call
doctor
to
help
me
into
cot
slept
sound
the
gale
continues
my
cabin
is
as
to
big
splashes
but
damp
and
dribbling
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
like
such
miseries
so
much
the
forecastle
is
under
water
with
every
lurch
and
the
motion
quite
incredible
to
one
only
acquainted
with
steamers
if
one
can
sit
this
ship
which
bounds
like
a
tiger
one
should
sit
a
leap
over
a
haystack
evidently
i
can
never
be
but
holding
on
is
hard
work
and
writing
harder
life
is
thus
cuddy
tea
for
and
milk
for
me
at
six
turns
out
when
she
is
dressed
i
turn
out
and
sing
out
for
avery
who
takes
down
my
cot
and
brings
a
bucket
of
salt
water
in
which
i
wash
with
vast
danger
and
difficulty
get
dressed
and
go
on
deck
at
eight
ladies
not
allowed
there
earlier
breakfast
solidly
at
nine
deck
again
gossip
pretend
to
read
beer
and
biscuit
at
twelve
the
faithful
avery
brings
mine
on
deck
dinner
at
four
do
a
little
carpentering
in
cabin
all
the
work
having
broken
loose
i
am
now
in
the
cabin
writing
we
have
the
wind
as
ever
dead
against
us
and
as
soon
as
we
get
unpleasantly
near
scilly
we
shall
tack
and
stand
back
to
the
french
coast
where
we
were
last
night
three
soldiers
able
to
answer
all
the
rest
utterly
sick
three
middies
helpless
several
of
crew
ditto
passengers
very
fairly
plucky
but
only
i
and
one
other
woman
who
never
was
at
sea
before
well
the
food
on
board
our
ship
is
good
as
to
meat
bread
and
beer
everything
else
bad
port
and
sherry
of
british
manufacture
and
the
water
with
an
incredible
essence
of
tar
so
that
tea
and
coffee
are
but
derisive
names
the
air
is
quite
saturated
with
wet
and
i
put
on
my
clothes
damp
when
i
dressed
and
have
felt
so
ever
since
i
am
so
glad
i
was
not
persuaded
out
of
my
cot
it
is
the
whole
difference
between
rest
and
holding
on
for
life
no
one
in
a
bunk
slept
at
all
on
monday
night
but
then
it
blew
as
heavy
a
gale
as
it
can
blow
and
we
had
the
cornish
coast
under
our
lee
so
we
tacked
and
tumbled
all
night
the
ship
being
new
too
has
the
rigging
all
wrong
and
the
confusion
and
disorder
are
beyond
description
the
officers
are
very
good
fellows
the
mizen
is
entirely
worked
by
the
so
we
never
see
the
sailors
and
at
present
are
not
allowed
to
go
forward
all
lights
are
put
out
at
ten
and
no
food
allowed
in
the
cabin
but
the
latter
article
my
friend
avery
makes
light
of
and
brings
me
anything
when
i
am
laid
up
the
young
bawl
for
him
with
expletives
but
he
says
with
a
snigger
to
me
just
wait
till
their
betters
the
ladies
is
looked
i
will
write
again
some
day
soon
and
take
the
chance
of
meeting
a
ship
you
may
be
amused
by
a
little
scrawl
though
it
will
probably
be
very
stupid
and
for
it
is
not
easy
to
see
or
to
guide
a
pen
while
i
hold
on
to
the
table
with
both
legs
and
one
arm
and
am
first
on
my
back
and
then
on
my
nose
adieu
till
next
time
i
have
had
a
good
taste
of
the
humours
of
the
channel
i
wrote
last
i
thought
we
had
had
our
share
of
contrary
winds
and
foul
weather
ever
since
we
have
beaten
about
the
bay
with
the
variety
of
a
favourable
gale
one
night
for
a
few
hours
and
a
dead
calm
yesterday
in
which
we
almost
rolled
our
masts
out
of
the
ship
however
the
sun
was
hot
and
i
sat
and
basked
on
deck
and
we
had
morning
service
it
was
a
striking
sight
with
the
sailors
seated
on
oars
and
buckets
covered
with
signal
flags
and
with
their
clean
frocks
and
faces
is
so
cold
that
i
dare
not
go
on
deck
and
am
writing
in
my
of
a
cabin
in
a
green
light
with
the
sun
blinking
through
the
waves
as
they
rush
over
my
port
and
scuttle
the
captain
is
much
vexed
at
the
loss
of
time
i
persist
in
thinking
it
a
very
pleasant
but
utterly
lazy
life
i
sleep
a
great
deal
but
eat
much
and
my
cough
has
been
bad
but
considering
the
real
hardship
of
the
cold
queer
food
and
bad
think
i
am
better
when
we
can
get
past
finisterre
i
shall
do
very
well
i
doubt
not
the
children
swarm
on
board
and
cry
unceasingly
a
is
no
place
for
children
our
poor
ship
will
lose
her
character
by
the
weather
as
she
can
not
fetch
up
ten
lost
time
but
she
is
evidently
a
we
overhaul
everything
we
see
at
a
wonderful
rate
and
the
speed
is
exciting
and
pleasant
but
the
next
long
voyage
i
make
try
for
a
good
wholesome
old
tub
which
will
roll
along
on
the
top
of
the
water
instead
of
cutting
through
it
with
the
waves
curling
in
at
the
cuddy
skylights
we
tried
to
signal
a
barque
yesterday
and
send
home
word
but
the
brutes
understood
nothing
but
russian
and
excited
our
indignation
by
talking
to
us
which
we
resented
with
true
british
spirit
as
became
us
it
is
now
blowing
hard
again
and
we
have
just
been
taken
right
aback
luckily
i
had
lashed
my
desk
to
my
or
that
would
have
flown
off
as
i
did
off
my
chair
i
think
i
shall
know
what
to
make
of
solid
ground
under
my
feet
the
rolling
and
pitching
of
a
ship
of
this
size
with
such
tall
masts
is
quite
unlike
the
little
niggling
sort
of
work
on
a
is
the
difference
between
grinding
along
a
bad
road
in
a
and
riding
well
to
hounds
in
a
close
country
on
a
good
hunter
i
was
horribly
tired
for
about
five
days
but
now
i
rather
like
it
and
never
know
whether
it
blows
or
not
in
the
night
i
sleep
so
soundly
the
noise
is
beyond
all
belief
the
creaking
trampling
shouting
clattering
it
is
an
incessant
storm
we
have
not
yet
got
our
masts
quite
safe
the
new
stretches
more
than
was
anticipated
of
course
and
our
is
shaky
the
crew
have
very
hard
work
as
incessant
tacking
is
added
to
all
the
extra
work
incident
to
a
new
ship
on
saturday
morning
everybody
was
shouting
for
the
carpenter
my
cabin
was
flooded
by
a
leak
and
i
superintended
the
baling
and
swabbing
from
my
cot
and
dressed
sitting
on
my
big
box
however
i
got
the
leak
stopped
and
cabin
dried
and
no
harm
done
as
i
had
put
everything
up
off
the
floor
the
night
before
suspicious
of
a
dribble
which
came
in
then
my
cot
frame
was
broken
by
my
cuddy
boy
and
i
lurching
over
against
bunk
in
taking
it
down
the
carpenter
has
given
me
his
own
and
takes
my
broken
one
for
himself
board
ship
is
a
famous
place
for
tempers
being
easily
satisfied
i
get
all
i
want
and
plenty
of
attention
and
kindness
but
i
can
not
prevail
on
my
cuddy
boy
to
refrain
from
violent
with
a
tin
tray
just
at
the
ear
of
a
lady
who
worries
him
the
young
too
i
hear
mentioned
as
lazy
and
they
struggle
for
water
and
tea
in
the
morning
long
after
mine
has
come
we
have
now
been
ten
days
at
sea
and
only
three
on
which
we
could
eat
without
the
transverse
pieces
of
wood
to
prevent
the
dishes
from
falling
off
smooth
water
will
seem
quite
strange
to
me
i
fear
the
poor
people
in
the
forecastle
must
be
very
wet
and
miserable
as
the
sea
is
constantly
over
it
not
in
spray
but
in
tons
of
green
water
had
two
days
of
dead
calm
then
one
or
two
of
a
very
light
favourable
breeze
and
yesterday
we
ran
miles
with
the
wind
right
aft
we
saw
several
ships
which
signalled
us
but
we
would
not
answer
as
we
had
our
spars
down
for
repairs
and
looked
like
a
wreck
and
fancied
it
would
be
a
pity
to
frighten
you
all
with
a
report
to
that
effect
last
night
we
got
all
right
and
spread
out
immense
we
are
now
bowling
along
wind
right
aft
dipping
our
booms
into
the
water
at
every
roll
the
weather
is
still
surprisingly
cold
though
very
fine
and
i
have
to
come
below
quite
early
out
of
the
evening
air
the
sun
sets
before
seven
i
still
cough
a
good
deal
and
the
bad
food
and
drink
are
trying
but
the
life
is
very
enjoyable
and
as
i
have
the
run
of
the
charts
and
ask
all
sorts
of
questions
i
get
plenty
of
amusement
is
an
excellent
traveller
no
grumbling
and
no
gossiping
which
on
board
a
ship
like
ours
is
a
great
merit
for
there
is
of
both
is
writing
a
charade
in
which
i
have
agreed
to
take
a
part
to
prevent
squabbling
he
wanted
to
start
a
daily
paper
but
the
captain
wisely
forbade
it
as
it
must
have
led
to
personalities
and
quarrels
and
suggested
a
play
instead
my
little
white
maltese
goat
is
very
well
and
gives
plenty
of
milk
which
is
a
great
resource
as
the
tea
and
coffee
are
abominable
avery
brings
it
me
at
six
in
a
tin
pannikin
and
again
in
the
evening
the
chief
officer
is
and
agreeable
and
indeed
all
the
young
gentlemen
are
wonderfully
good
specimens
of
their
class
the
captain
is
a
burly
foremast
man
in
manner
with
a
heart
of
wax
and
every
feeling
of
a
gentleman
he
was
in
california
with
dana
and
he
says
every
line
of
years
before
the
is
true
he
went
through
it
all
himself
he
says
that
i
am
a
great
help
to
him
as
a
pattern
of
discipline
and
punctuality
people
are
much
inclined
to
miss
meals
and
then
want
things
at
odd
hours
and
make
the
work
quite
impossible
to
the
cook
and
servants
of
course
i
get
all
i
want
in
time
as
i
try
to
save
my
man
trouble
and
the
carpenter
leaves
my
scuttle
open
when
no
one
else
gets
it
quite
willing
to
get
up
in
his
time
of
sleep
to
close
it
if
it
comes
on
to
blow
a
maid
is
really
a
superfluity
on
board
ship
as
the
men
rather
like
being
petits
the
boatswain
came
the
other
day
to
say
that
he
had
a
nice
carpet
and
a
good
pillow
did
i
want
anything
of
the
sort
he
would
be
proud
that
i
should
use
anything
of
his
you
would
delight
in
avery
my
cuddy
man
who
is
as
quick
as
and
full
of
fun
his
misery
is
my
want
of
appetite
and
his
efforts
to
cram
me
are
very
droll
the
days
seem
to
slip
away
one
tell
how
i
sit
on
deck
from
breakfast
at
nine
till
dinner
at
four
and
then
again
till
it
gets
cold
and
then
to
bed
we
are
now
about
miles
from
madeira
and
shall
have
to
run
inside
it
as
we
were
thrown
so
far
out
of
our
course
by
the
foul
weather
under
a
vertical
sun
lat
or
thereabouts
we
saw
madeira
at
a
distance
like
a
cloud
since
then
we
had
about
four
days
trade
wind
and
then
failing
or
contrary
breezes
we
have
sailed
so
near
the
african
shore
that
we
get
little
good
out
of
the
trades
and
suffer
much
from
the
african
climate
fancy
a
sky
like
a
pale
february
sky
in
london
no
sun
to
be
seen
and
a
heat
coming
one
tell
from
whence
the
sun
is
vertical
and
invisible
the
sea
glassy
and
heaving
i
have
been
ill
again
and
obliged
to
lie
still
yesterday
and
the
day
before
in
the
cabin
in
my
own
as
we
have
the
ports
open
and
the
maindeck
is
cooler
than
the
upper
the
men
have
just
been
holystoning
here
singing
away
lustily
in
chorus
last
night
i
got
leave
to
sling
my
cot
under
the
main
hatchway
as
my
cabin
must
have
killed
me
from
suffocation
when
shut
up
most
of
the
men
stayed
on
deck
but
that
is
dangerous
after
sunset
on
this
african
coast
on
account
of
the
heavy
dew
and
fever
they
tell
me
that
the
open
sea
is
quite
different
certainly
nothing
can
look
duller
and
dimmer
than
this
specimen
of
the
tropics
the
few
days
of
trade
wind
were
beautiful
and
cold
with
sparkling
sea
and
fresh
air
and
bright
sun
and
we
galloped
along
merrily
we
are
now
close
to
the
cape
de
verd
islands
and
shall
go
inside
them
about
lat
we
expect
to
catch
the
trade
wind
when
it
will
be
cold
again
in
lat
the
day
before
we
entered
the
tropics
i
sat
on
deck
in
a
coat
and
cloak
the
heat
is
quite
sudden
and
only
lasts
a
week
or
so
the
sea
is
littered
all
round
the
ship
with
our
floating
rubbish
so
we
have
not
moved
at
all
i
constantly
long
for
you
to
be
here
though
i
am
not
sure
you
would
like
the
life
as
well
as
i
do
all
your
ideas
of
it
are
wrong
the
confinement
to
the
poop
and
the
stringent
regulations
would
bore
you
but
then
sitting
on
deck
in
fine
weather
is
pleasure
enough
without
anything
else
in
a
ship
a
yacht
or
a
merchantman
with
fewer
passengers
it
must
be
a
delightful
existence
i
wrote
last
we
got
into
the
monsoon
for
one
day
and
i
sat
up
by
the
steersman
in
intense
bright
sun
and
glittering
blue
sea
and
we
tore
along
pitching
and
tossing
the
water
up
like
mad
it
was
glorious
at
night
i
was
calmly
reposing
in
my
cot
in
the
middle
of
the
steerage
just
behind
the
main
hatchway
when
i
heard
a
crashing
of
rigging
and
a
violent
noise
and
confusion
on
deck
the
captain
screamed
out
orders
which
informed
me
that
we
were
in
the
thick
of
a
course
i
lay
still
and
waited
till
the
row
or
the
ship
went
down
i
found
myself
next
day
looked
upon
as
no
better
than
a
heathen
by
all
the
women
because
i
had
been
cool
and
declined
to
get
up
and
make
a
noise
presently
the
officers
came
and
told
me
that
a
big
ship
had
borne
down
on
were
on
the
starboard
tack
and
all
off
our
flying
and
whisker
the
sort
of
yard
to
the
bowsprit
the
captain
says
he
was
never
in
such
imminent
danger
in
his
life
as
she
threatened
to
swing
round
and
to
crush
into
our
waist
which
would
have
been
certain
destruction
the
little
dandy
behaved
capitally
he
turned
his
men
up
in
no
time
and
had
them
all
ready
he
said
you
know
i
must
see
that
my
fellows
go
down
was
as
cool
as
an
icicle
offered
me
my
which
i
declined
as
it
would
be
of
no
use
for
me
to
go
off
in
boats
even
supposing
there
were
time
and
i
preferred
going
down
comfortably
in
my
cot
finding
she
was
of
no
use
to
me
she
took
a
yelling
maid
in
custody
and
was
thought
a
brute
for
begging
her
to
hold
her
noise
the
first
lieutenant
who
looks
on
passengers
as
odious
cargo
has
utterly
mollified
to
me
since
this
adventure
i
heard
him
report
to
the
captain
that
i
was
all
and
never
sung
out
nor
asked
a
question
the
this
he
called
next
day
we
got
light
wind
which
ought
to
be
the
trades
and
the
weather
has
been
beyond
all
description
lovely
ever
since
cool
but
soft
sunny
and
short
perfect
only
the
sky
is
so
pale
last
night
the
sunset
was
a
vision
of
loveliness
a
sort
of
pompadour
paradise
the
sky
seemed
full
of
and
the
moon
wore
a
veil
of
bright
pink
cloud
all
so
light
so
airy
so
brilliant
and
so
fleeting
that
it
was
a
kind
of
intoxication
it
is
far
less
grand
than
northern
colour
but
so
lovely
so
shiny
then
the
flying
fish
skimmed
like
silver
swallows
over
the
blue
water
such
a
sight
also
i
saw
a
whale
spout
like
a
very
tiny
garden
fountain
the
southern
cross
is
a
delusion
and
the
tropical
moon
no
better
than
a
parisian
one
at
present
we
are
now
in
lat
about
and
have
been
driven
halfway
to
rio
by
this
sweet
southern
breeze
i
have
never
yet
sat
on
deck
without
a
cloth
jacket
or
shawl
and
the
evenings
are
chilly
i
no
longer
believe
in
tropical
heat
at
sea
even
during
the
calm
it
was
not
so
hot
as
i
have
often
felt
it
in
that
under
a
vertical
sun
the
ship
that
nearly
ran
us
and
herself
down
must
have
kept
no
and
refused
to
answer
our
hail
she
is
supposed
to
be
from
glasgow
by
her
looks
we
may
speak
a
ship
and
send
letters
on
board
so
excuse
scrawl
and
confusion
it
is
so
difficult
to
write
at
all
lat
and
very
much
to
the
west
we
have
had
all
sorts
of
beautiful
some
very
rough
but
always
contrary
got
within
miles
of
the
coast
of
south
america
we
now
have
a
milder
breeze
from
the
after
a
with
cape
pigeons
and
mollymawks
a
small
albatross
not
to
compare
with
our
gulls
we
had
private
theatricals
last
acted
but
beautifully
got
up
as
far
as
the
sailors
were
concerned
i
did
not
act
as
i
did
not
feel
well
enough
but
i
put
a
bit
for
neptune
into
the
prologue
and
made
the
mate
speak
it
to
make
up
for
the
absence
of
any
shaving
at
the
line
which
the
captain
prohibited
altogether
i
thought
it
hard
the
men
should
not
get
their
the
mate
dressed
and
spoke
it
admirably
and
the
old
carpenter
sang
a
famous
comic
song
dressed
to
perfection
as
a
ploughboy
i
am
disappointed
in
the
tropics
as
to
warmth
our
thermometer
stood
at
one
day
only
under
the
vertical
sun
of
the
line
the
line
at
and
at
sea
it
colder
than
it
is
i
have
never
been
hot
except
for
two
days
of
the
line
and
now
it
is
very
cold
but
it
is
very
invigorating
all
day
long
it
looks
and
feels
like
early
morning
the
sky
is
pale
blue
with
light
broken
clouds
the
sea
an
inconceivably
pure
opaque
lazuli
but
far
brighter
i
saw
a
lovely
dolphin
three
days
ago
his
body
five
feet
long
some
said
more
is
of
a
and
his
huge
tail
golden
bronze
i
was
glad
he
scorned
the
bait
and
escaped
the
hook
he
was
so
beautiful
this
is
the
sea
from
which
venus
rose
in
her
youthful
glory
all
is
young
fresh
serene
beautiful
and
cheerful
we
have
not
seen
a
sail
for
weeks
but
the
life
at
sea
makes
amends
for
anything
to
my
mind
i
am
never
tired
of
the
calms
and
i
enjoy
a
stiff
gale
like
a
mother
chicken
so
long
as
i
can
be
on
deck
or
in
the
cabin
between
decks
it
is
very
close
and
suffocating
in
rough
weather
as
all
is
shut
up
we
shall
be
still
three
weeks
before
we
reach
the
cape
and
now
the
sun
sets
with
a
sudden
plunge
before
six
and
the
evenings
are
growing
too
cold
again
for
me
to
go
on
deck
after
dinner
as
long
as
i
could
i
spent
fourteen
hours
out
of
the
in
my
quiet
corner
by
the
wheel
basking
in
the
tropical
sun
never
again
will
i
believe
in
the
tales
of
a
burning
sun
the
vertical
sun
just
kept
me
more
in
two
days
we
shall
be
bitterly
cold
again
immediately
after
writing
the
above
it
began
to
blow
a
gale
favourable
indeed
but
more
furious
than
the
captain
had
ever
known
in
these
seas
lat
and
long
for
three
days
we
ran
under
four
reefs
topsails
before
a
sea
the
gale
in
the
bay
of
biscay
was
a
little
shaking
up
in
a
puddle
a
dirty
one
compared
to
that
glorious
south
atlantic
in
all
its
majestic
fury
the
intense
blue
waves
crowned
with
fantastic
crests
of
bright
emeralds
and
with
the
spray
blowing
about
like
wild
dishevelled
hair
came
after
us
to
swallow
us
up
at
a
mouthful
but
took
us
up
on
their
backs
and
hurried
us
along
as
if
our
ship
were
a
cork
then
the
gale
slackened
and
we
had
a
dead
calm
during
which
the
waves
banged
us
about
frightfully
and
our
masts
were
in
much
jeopardy
then
a
foul
wind
increased
into
a
gale
lasting
five
days
during
which
orders
were
given
in
dumb
show
as
no
voice
could
be
heard
through
it
we
fought
and
laboured
and
dipped
under
water
and
i
only
had
my
dry
corner
by
the
wheel
where
the
kind
pleasant
little
third
officer
lashed
me
tight
it
was
far
more
formidable
than
the
first
gale
but
less
beautiful
and
we
made
so
much
that
we
lost
ten
days
and
only
arrived
here
yesterday
i
recommend
a
heavy
gale
in
the
south
atlantic
as
a
cure
for
a
state
of
mind
it
can
not
be
described
the
sound
the
sense
of
being
hurled
along
without
the
smallest
regard
to
side
the
beauty
of
the
whole
scene
and
the
occasional
crack
and
of
sails
and
spars
the
officer
trying
to
quite
in
vain
and
the
whistle
scarcely
audible
i
remained
near
the
wheel
every
day
for
as
long
as
i
could
bear
it
and
was
enchanted
then
the
mortal
perils
of
eating
drinking
moving
sitting
lying
standing
be
done
even
by
the
sailors
without
holding
on
night
of
the
gale
my
cot
twice
touched
the
beams
of
the
ship
above
me
i
asked
the
captain
if
i
had
dreamt
it
but
he
said
it
was
quite
possible
he
had
never
seen
a
ship
so
completely
on
her
beam
ends
come
up
all
right
masts
and
yards
all
sound
there
is
a
middy
about
half
size
a
very
tiny
who
has
been
my
delight
he
is
so
completely
officer
and
the
my
maternal
entrails
turned
like
old
alvarez
when
that
baby
lay
out
on
the
very
end
of
the
yard
to
reef
in
the
gale
it
was
quite
voluntary
and
the
other
newcomers
all
declined
i
always
called
him
and
asked
his
leave
gravely
or
on
occasions
his
protection
and
assistance
and
his
little
dignity
was
lovely
he
is
polite
to
the
ladies
and
slightly
distant
to
the
bigger
than
himself
whom
he
orders
off
dangerous
places
come
out
of
that
be
a
few
days
before
landing
i
caught
a
bad
cold
and
kept
my
bed
i
caught
this
cold
by
with
a
damp
man
in
my
as
some
one
said
during
the
last
gale
the
cabin
opposite
mine
was
utterly
swamped
and
i
found
the
irish
of
a
little
officer
of
eighteen
in
despair
the
poor
lad
had
got
ague
and
eight
inches
of
water
in
his
bed
and
two
feet
in
the
cabin
i
looked
in
and
said
stay
him
into
my
cabin
and
lay
him
in
the
which
he
did
with
tears
running
down
his
honest
old
face
so
we
got
the
boy
into
bed
and
cured
his
fever
and
ague
caught
under
canvas
in
romney
marsh
meantime
had
to
sleep
in
a
chair
and
to
undress
in
the
wet
cabin
as
a
token
of
gratitude
he
sent
me
a
poodle
pup
born
on
board
very
handsome
the
artillery
officers
were
generally
the
men
deserters
and
ruffians
sent
out
as
drivers
we
have
had
five
and
two
floggings
in
eight
weeks
among
seventy
men
they
were
pampered
with
food
and
porter
and
would
not
pull
a
rope
or
get
up
at
six
to
air
their
quarters
the
sailors
are
an
excellent
set
of
men
when
we
parted
the
first
lieutenant
said
to
me
a
wonderful
idee
of
discipline
for
a
leddy
i
will
say
never
been
reported
but
once
and
that
was
on
sick
leave
for
your
light
and
all
in
cape
town
we
anchored
yesterday
morning
and
captain
the
port
captain
came
off
with
a
most
kind
letter
from
sir
baldwin
walker
his
gig
and
a
boat
and
crew
for
and
the
baggage
so
i
was
whipped
over
the
side
in
a
chair
and
have
come
to
a
boarding
house
where
the
live
i
was
tired
and
dizzy
and
landsick
and
lay
down
and
went
to
sleep
after
an
hour
or
so
i
woke
hearing
a
little
like
that
of
chimney
swallows
on
opening
my
eyes
i
beheld
four
demons
of
the
obedient
each
bearing
an
article
of
furniture
and
holding
converse
over
me
in
the
language
of
nephelecoecygia
why
has
no
one
ever
mentioned
the
curious
little
soft
voices
of
these
coolies
hear
them
with
the
naked
ear
three
feet
off
the
most
hideous
demon
whose
complexion
had
not
only
the
colour
but
the
precise
metallic
lustre
of
an
ill
stove
at
last
chirruped
a
wish
for
orders
which
i
gave
i
asked
the
pert
active
cockney
housemaid
what
i
ought
to
pay
them
as
being
a
stranger
they
might
overcharge
me
her
scorn
was
sublime
nasty
blacks
never
asks
more
than
their
regular
so
i
asked
the
demon
who
demanded
shilling
each
horse
in
and
a
dollar
each
he
then
glided
with
fiendish
noiselessness
about
the
room
arranged
the
furniture
to
his
own
taste
and
finally
said
missus
then
more
chirruping
among
themselves
and
finally
a
fearful
gesture
of
incantation
accompanied
by
bless
poor
missus
soon
well
the
wrath
of
the
cockney
housemaid
became
majestic
you
see
how
saucy
they
have
nasty
black
heathen
mohamedan
a
blessing
of
a
white
christian
these
men
are
the
auvergnats
of
africa
i
was
assured
that
bankers
entrust
them
with
large
sums
in
gold
which
they
carry
some
hundred
and
twenty
miles
by
unknown
tracks
for
a
small
gratuity
the
pretty
graceful
malays
are
no
honester
than
ourselves
but
are
excellent
workmen
my
linen
will
go
to
a
ravine
in
the
giant
mountain
at
my
back
and
there
be
scoured
in
a
clear
spring
by
brown
women
bleached
on
the
mountain
top
and
carried
back
all
those
long
miles
on
their
heads
as
it
went
up
my
landlady
is
dutch
the
waiter
is
an
africander
half
dutch
half
malay
very
handsome
and
exactly
like
a
french
gentleman
and
as
civil
enter
lad
with
a
nosegay
only
one
flower
that
i
the
vegetation
is
lovely
the
freshness
of
spring
and
the
richness
of
summer
the
leaves
on
the
trees
are
in
all
the
beauty
of
spring
brought
me
a
plate
of
oranges
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
oh
how
good
they
were
better
even
than
the
maltese
they
are
going
out
and
a
penny
very
large
and
delicious
i
am
wild
to
get
out
and
see
the
glorious
scenery
and
the
hideous
people
the
wind
has
been
a
cold
and
i
have
not
been
out
my
windows
look
and
so
i
get
all
the
sun
and
warmth
the
beauty
of
table
bay
is
astounding
fancy
the
undercliff
in
the
isle
of
wight
magnified
a
with
clouds
floating
halfway
up
the
mountain
the
hottentot
mountains
in
the
distance
have
a
fantastic
jagged
outline
which
hardly
looks
real
the
town
is
like
those
in
the
south
of
europe
flat
roofs
and
all
unfinished
roads
are
simply
at
the
doors
sat
brown
women
with
black
hair
that
shone
like
metal
very
handsome
they
are
malays
and
their
men
wear
conical
hats
of
turbans
and
are
the
chief
artisans
at
the
end
of
the
pier
sat
a
mozambique
woman
in
white
drapery
and
the
most
majestic
attitude
like
a
roman
matron
her
features
large
and
strong
and
harsh
but
fine
and
her
skin
blacker
than
night
i
have
got
a
couple
of
cape
pigeons
the
of
the
south
atlantic
for
hat
they
followed
us
several
thousand
miles
and
were
hooked
for
their
pains
the
albatrosses
did
not
come
within
hail
the
little
maltese
goat
gave
a
pint
of
milk
night
and
morning
and
was
a
great
comfort
to
the
cow
she
did
not
like
the
land
or
the
grass
at
first
and
is
to
be
thrown
out
of
milk
now
she
is
much
admired
and
petted
by
the
young
africander
my
room
is
at
least
eighteen
feet
high
and
contains
exactly
a
bedstead
one
straw
mattrass
one
rickety
table
one
two
chairs
and
broken
no
carpet
and
a
hiatus
of
three
inches
between
the
floor
and
the
door
but
all
very
clean
and
excellent
food
i
have
not
made
a
bargain
yet
but
i
dare
say
i
shall
stay
here
have
just
received
your
letter
where
it
has
been
hiding
i
conceive
is
cold
and
foggy
like
a
baddish
day
in
june
with
you
no
colder
if
so
cold
still
i
did
not
venture
out
the
fog
rolls
so
heavily
over
the
mountain
well
i
must
send
off
this
yarn
which
is
as
interminable
as
the
and
which
i
twisted
with
the
mids
letter
ii
cape
town
i
came
on
shore
on
a
very
fine
day
but
the
weather
changed
and
we
had
a
fortnight
of
cold
and
damp
and
wind
equivalent
to
our
east
wind
such
as
the
never
experienced
and
i
have
had
as
bad
an
attack
of
bronchitis
as
ever
i
remember
having
been
in
bed
till
yesterday
i
had
a
very
good
doctor
half
italian
half
dane
born
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
educated
at
edinburgh
named
chiappini
he
has
a
son
studying
medicine
in
london
whose
mother
is
dutch
such
is
the
mixture
of
bloods
here
yesterday
the
wind
went
to
the
the
blessed
sun
shone
out
and
the
weather
was
lovely
at
once
the
mountain
threw
off
his
cloak
of
cloud
and
all
was
bright
and
warm
i
got
up
and
sat
in
the
verandah
over
the
stoep
a
kind
of
terrace
in
front
of
every
house
here
they
brought
me
a
tortoise
as
big
as
half
a
crown
and
as
lively
as
a
cricket
to
look
at
and
a
chameleon
like
a
fairy
green
fellow
five
inches
long
with
no
claws
on
his
feet
but
suckers
like
a
most
engaging
little
beast
he
sat
on
my
finger
and
caught
flies
with
great
delight
and
dexterity
and
i
longed
to
send
him
to
i
went
a
long
drive
with
captain
and
we
went
to
rondebosch
and
country
rather
like
herefordshire
red
earth
and
miles
of
the
road
were
like
on
a
large
scale
and
looked
quite
english
only
here
and
there
a
hedge
of
prickly
pear
or
the
big
white
aruns
in
the
ditches
told
a
different
tale
and
the
scarlet
geraniums
and
myrtles
growing
wild
puzzled
one
and
then
came
rattling
along
a
light
rough
but
cart
with
an
arab
screw
driven
by
a
malay
in
a
great
hat
on
his
kerchiefed
head
and
his
wife
with
her
neat
dress
glossy
black
hair
and
great
gold
earrings
they
were
coming
with
fish
which
he
had
just
caught
at
kalk
bay
and
was
going
to
sell
for
the
dinners
of
the
capetown
folk
you
pass
neat
villas
with
pretty
gardens
and
stoeps
gay
with
flowers
and
at
the
doors
of
several
neat
malay
girls
are
lounging
they
are
the
best
servants
here
for
the
emigrants
mostly
drink
then
you
see
a
group
of
children
at
play
some
as
black
as
coals
some
brown
and
very
pretty
a
little
black
girl
about
age
has
carefully
tied
what
little
petticoat
she
has
in
a
tight
coil
round
her
waist
and
displays
the
most
darling
little
round
legs
and
behind
which
it
would
be
a
real
pleasure
to
slap
it
is
so
shiny
and
round
and
she
runs
and
stands
so
strongly
and
gracefully
here
comes
another
malay
with
a
pair
of
baskets
hanging
from
a
stick
across
his
shoulder
like
those
in
chinese
pictures
which
his
hat
also
resembles
another
cart
full
of
working
men
with
a
malay
driver
and
inside
are
jumbled
some
english
navvies
with
the
ugliest
mozambiques
blacker
than
erebus
and
with
faces
all
knobs
and
corners
like
a
crusty
loaf
as
we
drive
home
we
see
a
span
of
sixteen
noble
oxen
in
the
and
on
the
ground
squats
the
hottentot
driver
his
face
no
words
can
are
up
under
his
hat
and
his
chin
halfway
down
to
his
waist
his
eyes
have
the
dull
look
of
a
and
his
skin
is
dirty
and
sallow
but
not
darker
than
a
dirty
capetown
is
rather
pretty
but
beyond
words
untidy
and
out
of
repair
as
it
is
neither
drained
nor
paved
it
do
in
hot
weather
and
i
shall
migrate
to
a
dutch
village
who
is
dutch
herself
tells
me
that
one
may
board
in
a
dutch
very
cheaply
and
with
great
comfort
of
course
eating
with
the
family
and
that
they
will
drive
you
about
the
country
and
tend
your
horses
for
nothing
if
you
are
friendly
and
treat
them
with
packet
came
in
last
night
but
just
in
time
to
save
the
fine
of
per
diem
and
i
got
your
welcome
letter
this
morning
i
have
been
coughing
all
this
time
but
i
hope
i
shall
improve
i
came
out
at
the
very
worst
time
of
year
and
the
weather
has
been
of
course
bad
and
changeable
but
when
it
fine
it
is
quite
celestial
so
clear
so
dry
so
light
then
comes
a
cloud
over
table
mountain
like
the
sugar
on
a
which
tumbles
down
in
splendid
waterfalls
and
vanishes
unaccountably
halfway
and
then
you
run
indoors
and
shut
doors
and
windows
or
it
portends
a
a
hurricane
and
capetown
disappears
in
impenetrable
clouds
of
dust
but
this
wind
coming
off
the
hills
and
fields
of
ice
is
the
cape
doctor
and
keeps
away
cholera
fever
of
every
sort
and
all
malignant
or
infectious
diseases
most
of
them
are
unknown
here
never
was
so
healthy
a
place
but
the
remedy
is
of
the
heroic
nature
and
very
disagreeable
the
stones
rattle
against
the
windows
and
omnibuses
are
blown
over
on
the
rondebosch
road
a
few
days
ago
i
drove
to
farm
imagine
hill
and
the
most
beautiful
bits
of
it
sloping
gently
up
to
table
mountain
with
its
grey
precipices
and
intersected
with
scotch
burns
which
water
it
all
the
year
round
as
they
come
from
the
living
rock
and
sprinkled
with
oranges
pomegranates
and
camelias
in
abundance
you
drive
through
a
mile
or
two
as
described
and
arrive
at
a
square
planted
with
rows
of
fine
oaks
close
together
at
the
upper
end
stands
the
house
all
on
the
but
on
a
high
stoep
rooms
eighteen
feet
high
the
old
slave
quarters
on
each
side
stables
opposite
the
square
as
big
as
belgrave
square
and
the
buildings
in
the
old
french
style
we
then
went
on
to
newlands
a
still
more
beautiful
place
immense
trenching
and
draining
going
foreman
a
caffre
black
as
ink
six
feet
three
inches
high
and
broad
in
proportion
with
a
staid
dignified
air
and
englishmen
working
under
him
at
the
streamlets
there
are
the
inevitable
groups
of
malay
women
washing
clothes
and
brown
babies
sprawling
about
yesterday
i
should
have
bought
a
black
woman
for
her
beauty
had
it
been
still
possible
she
was
carrying
an
immense
weight
on
her
head
and
was
far
gone
with
child
but
such
stupendous
physical
perfection
i
never
even
imagined
her
jet
black
face
was
like
the
sphynx
with
the
same
mysterious
smile
her
shape
and
walk
were
and
the
lustre
of
her
skin
teeth
and
eyes
showed
the
fulness
of
health
of
course
i
walked
after
her
as
far
as
her
swift
pace
would
let
me
in
envy
and
admiration
of
such
stately
humanity
the
ordinary
blacks
or
mozambiques
as
they
call
them
are
hideous
malay
here
seems
equivalent
to
mohammedan
they
were
originally
malays
but
now
they
include
every
shade
from
the
blackest
nigger
to
the
most
blooming
english
woman
yes
indeed
the
have
been
known
to
turn
and
get
thereby
husbands
who
know
not
billiards
and
two
diseases
of
capetown
they
risked
a
plurality
of
wives
and
professed
islam
but
they
got
fine
clothes
and
industrious
husbands
they
wear
a
very
pretty
dress
and
all
have
a
great
air
of
independence
and
and
the
real
malays
are
very
handsome
i
am
going
to
see
one
of
the
mollahs
soon
and
to
look
at
their
schools
and
mosque
which
to
the
distraction
of
the
scotch
they
call
their
i
asked
a
malay
if
he
would
drive
me
in
his
cart
with
the
six
or
eight
mules
which
he
agreed
to
do
for
thirty
shillings
and
his
dinner
a
share
of
my
dinner
on
the
road
when
i
asked
how
long
it
would
take
he
said
is
which
meant
i
found
that
it
depended
on
the
state
of
the
only
road
for
half
the
way
the
sun
moon
and
stars
are
different
beings
from
those
we
look
upon
not
only
are
they
so
large
and
bright
but
you
that
the
moon
and
stars
are
and
that
the
sky
is
endless
beyond
them
on
the
other
hand
the
clear
dry
air
dwarfs
table
mountain
as
you
seem
to
see
every
detail
of
it
to
the
very
top
capetown
is
very
picturesque
the
old
dutch
buildings
are
very
handsome
and
peculiar
but
are
falling
to
decay
and
dirt
in
the
hands
of
their
present
possessors
the
few
dutch
ladies
i
have
seen
are
very
pleasing
they
are
gentle
and
simple
and
naturally
some
of
the
malay
women
are
very
handsome
and
the
little
children
are
darlings
a
little
group
of
every
shade
from
ebony
to
golden
hair
and
blue
eyes
were
at
play
in
the
street
yesterday
and
the
majority
were
pretty
especially
the
most
of
the
caffres
i
have
seen
look
like
the
perfection
of
human
physical
nature
and
seem
to
have
no
diseases
two
days
ago
i
saw
a
hottentot
girl
of
seventeen
a
housemaid
here
you
would
be
enchanted
by
her
superfluity
of
flesh
the
face
was
very
queer
and
ugly
and
yet
pleasing
from
the
sweet
smile
and
the
rosy
cheeks
which
please
one
much
in
contrast
to
all
the
pale
yellow
as
some
of
them
are
i
wish
i
could
send
the
six
chameleons
which
a
parson
brought
me
in
his
hat
and
a
queer
lizard
in
his
pocket
the
chameleons
are
charming
so
and
so
they
sit
on
my
breakfast
tray
and
catch
flies
and
hang
in
a
bunch
by
their
tails
and
reach
out
after
my
hand
i
have
had
a
very
kind
letter
from
lady
walker
and
shall
go
and
stay
with
them
at
bay
as
soon
as
i
feel
up
to
the
miles
along
the
beaches
and
bad
roads
in
the
with
three
horses
the
teams
of
mules
i
beg
pardon
spans
would
delight
ten
twelve
even
sixteen
sleek
handsome
beasts
and
oh
such
oxen
noble
beasts
with
humps
and
hump
is
very
good
to
eat
too
mail
goes
out
so
i
must
finish
this
letter
i
feel
better
than
i
have
yet
felt
in
spite
of
the
yours
letter
iii
i
wrote
we
have
had
more
really
cold
weather
but
yesterday
the
summer
seems
to
have
begun
the
air
is
as
light
and
clear
as
if
were
and
the
sun
hot
but
i
walk
in
it
and
do
not
find
it
oppressive
all
the
household
groans
and
perspires
but
i
am
very
comfortable
yesterday
i
sat
in
the
full
broil
for
an
hour
or
more
in
the
hot
dust
of
the
malay
they
buried
the
head
butcher
of
the
mussulmans
and
a
most
strange
poetical
scene
it
was
the
is
on
the
side
of
the
lion
the
overlooks
the
whole
bay
part
of
the
town
and
the
most
superb
mountain
panorama
beyond
i
never
saw
a
view
within
miles
of
it
for
beauty
and
grandeur
far
down
a
fussy
english
steamer
came
puffing
and
popping
into
the
deep
blue
bay
and
the
cabs
went
tearing
down
to
the
landing
place
and
round
me
sat
a
crowd
of
grave
brown
men
chanting
il
to
the
most
monotonous
but
musical
air
and
with
the
most
perfect
voices
the
chant
seemed
to
swell
and
then
fade
like
the
wind
in
the
trees
i
went
in
after
the
procession
which
consisted
of
a
bier
covered
with
three
common
paisley
shawls
of
gay
colours
no
one
looked
at
me
and
when
they
got
near
the
grave
i
kept
at
a
distance
and
sat
down
when
they
did
but
a
man
came
up
and
said
are
so
i
went
close
and
saw
the
whole
ceremony
they
took
the
corpse
wrapped
in
a
sheet
out
of
the
bier
and
lifted
it
into
the
grave
where
two
men
received
it
then
a
sheet
was
held
over
the
grave
till
they
had
placed
the
dead
man
and
then
flowers
and
earth
were
thrown
in
by
all
present
the
grave
filled
in
watered
out
of
a
brass
kettle
and
decked
with
flowers
then
a
fat
old
man
in
printed
calico
shirt
sleeves
and
a
plaid
waistcoat
and
corduroy
trousers
pulled
off
his
shoes
squatted
on
the
grave
and
recited
endless
many
reciting
after
him
then
they
chanted
for
twenty
minutes
i
think
then
prayers
with
and
again
then
all
jumped
up
and
walked
off
there
were
eighty
or
a
hundred
men
no
women
and
five
or
six
draped
in
beautiful
eastern
dresses
and
looking
very
supercilious
the
whole
party
made
less
noise
in
moving
and
talking
than
two
englishmen
a
man
spoke
to
me
in
excellent
english
which
few
of
them
speak
and
was
very
communicative
and
civil
he
told
me
the
dead
man
was
his
and
he
himself
the
barber
i
hoped
i
had
not
taken
a
liberty
no
poor
malays
were
proud
when
noble
english
persons
showed
such
respect
to
their
religion
the
young
prince
had
done
so
too
and
allah
would
not
forget
to
protect
him
he
also
did
not
laugh
at
their
prayers
praise
be
to
god
i
had
already
heard
that
prince
alfred
is
quite
the
darling
of
the
malays
he
insisted
on
accepting
their
which
the
capetown
people
had
snubbed
i
have
a
friendship
with
one
abdul
jemaalee
and
his
wife
betsy
a
couple
of
old
folks
who
were
slaves
to
dutch
owners
and
now
keep
a
of
a
rough
sort
with
fruiterer
painted
on
the
back
of
an
old
tin
tray
and
hung
up
by
the
door
of
the
house
abdul
first
bought
himself
and
then
his
wife
betsy
whose
generously
threw
in
her
mother
he
is
a
fine
handsome
old
man
and
has
confided
to
me
that
would
not
buy
what
he
is
worth
now
i
have
also
read
the
letters
written
by
his
son
young
abdul
rachman
now
a
student
at
cairo
who
has
been
away
five
at
mecca
the
young
theologian
writes
to
his
eerbare
a
fond
request
for
money
and
promises
to
return
soon
i
am
invited
to
the
feast
wherewith
he
will
be
welcomed
old
abdul
jemaalee
thinks
it
will
divert
my
mind
and
prove
to
me
that
allah
will
take
me
home
safe
to
my
children
about
whom
he
and
his
wife
asked
many
questions
moreover
he
compelled
me
to
drink
herb
tea
compounded
by
a
malay
doctor
for
my
cough
i
declined
at
first
and
the
poor
old
man
looked
hurt
gravely
assured
me
that
it
was
not
true
that
malays
always
poisoned
christians
and
drank
some
himself
thereupon
i
was
obliged
of
course
to
drink
up
the
rest
it
certainly
did
me
good
and
i
have
drunk
it
since
with
good
effect
it
is
intensely
bitter
and
rather
sticky
the
white
servants
and
the
dutch
landlady
where
i
lodge
shake
their
heads
ominously
and
hope
it
poison
me
a
year
hence
nasty
malays
can
make
it
work
months
after
you
take
they
also
possess
the
evil
eye
and
a
talent
for
love
potions
as
the
men
are
very
handsome
and
neat
i
incline
to
believe
that
part
of
it
halfway
drove
out
here
yesterday
in
captain
drag
which
he
kindly
brought
into
capetown
for
me
he
and
his
wife
and
children
came
for
a
change
of
air
for
whooping
cough
and
advised
me
to
come
too
as
my
cough
continues
though
less
troublesome
it
is
a
lovely
spot
six
miles
from
constantia
ten
from
capetown
and
twelve
from
bay
i
intend
to
stay
here
a
little
while
and
then
to
go
to
kalk
bay
six
miles
from
hence
this
inn
was
excellent
i
hear
the
old
dutch
now
it
is
kept
by
a
young
englishman
and
his
wife
and
is
dirty
and
disorderly
i
pay
twelve
shillings
a
day
for
and
self
without
a
and
my
bed
is
a
straw
paillasse
but
the
food
is
plentiful
and
not
very
bad
that
is
the
cheapest
rate
of
living
possible
here
and
every
trifle
costs
double
what
it
would
in
england
except
wine
which
is
very
fair
at
fivepence
a
kind
of
hock
the
landlord
pays
a
day
rent
for
this
house
which
is
the
great
resort
of
the
capetown
people
for
sundays
and
for
change
of
air
rude
kind
of
richmond
his
cook
gets
a
month
besides
food
for
himself
and
wife
and
beer
and
sugar
the
two
white
housemaids
get
and
respectively
everything
by
the
month
fresh
butter
is
a
pound
mutton
washing
very
dear
cabbages
my
host
sells
at
a
piece
and
pumpkins
he
has
a
fine
garden
and
pays
a
gardener
a
day
and
black
labourers
work
three
days
a
week
then
they
buy
rice
and
a
coarse
fish
and
lie
in
the
sun
till
it
is
eaten
while
their
darling
little
fat
black
babies
play
in
the
dust
and
their
black
wives
make
battues
in
the
covers
in
their
woolly
heads
but
the
little
black
girl
who
cleans
my
room
is
far
the
best
servant
and
smiles
and
speaks
like
lalage
herself
ugly
as
the
poor
drudge
is
the
voice
and
smile
of
the
negroes
here
is
bewitching
though
they
are
hideous
and
neither
nor
i
have
yet
heard
a
black
child
cry
or
seen
one
naughty
or
quarrelsome
you
would
want
to
lay
out
a
fortune
in
woolly
babies
yesterday
i
had
a
dreadful
heartache
after
my
darling
on
her
little
birthday
and
even
the
lovely
ranges
of
distant
mountains
coloured
like
opals
in
the
sunset
did
not
delight
me
this
is
a
dreary
place
for
strangers
abdul
tisanne
and
a
banana
which
he
gave
me
each
time
i
went
to
his
shop
are
the
sole
offer
of
you
take
something
or
even
the
sole
attempt
at
a
civility
that
i
have
received
except
from
the
who
are
very
civil
and
kind
when
i
have
done
my
visit
to
bay
i
will
go
to
stellenbosch
paarl
and
worcester
perhaps
if
i
can
find
people
going
in
a
i
will
join
them
it
costs
a
day
and
goes
twenty
miles
if
money
were
no
object
i
would
hire
one
with
caffres
to
hunt
as
well
as
outspan
and
drive
and
take
a
there
is
plenty
of
pleasure
to
be
had
in
travelling
here
if
you
can
afford
it
the
scenery
is
quite
beyond
anything
you
can
imagine
in
beauty
i
went
to
a
country
house
at
rondebosch
with
the
and
i
never
saw
so
lovely
a
spot
the
possessor
had
done
his
best
to
spoil
it
and
to
destroy
the
handsome
dutch
house
and
fountains
and
aqueducts
but
nature
was
too
much
for
him
and
the
place
lovely
in
neglect
and
shabbiness
now
i
will
tell
you
my
impressions
of
the
state
of
society
here
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
make
out
by
playing
the
inquisitive
traveller
i
dare
say
the
statements
are
exaggerated
but
i
do
not
think
they
are
wholly
devoid
of
truth
the
dutch
round
capetown
i
know
anything
of
are
sulky
and
dispirited
they
regret
the
slave
days
and
bear
to
pay
wages
they
have
sold
all
their
fine
houses
in
town
to
merchants
and
let
their
handsome
country
places
go
to
pieces
and
their
land
lie
fallow
rather
than
hire
the
men
they
used
to
own
they
hate
the
malays
who
were
their
slaves
and
whose
annoys
them
and
they
like
the
vulgar
bustling
english
the
english
complain
that
the
dutch
die
and
that
they
are
the
curse
of
the
colony
a
statement
for
which
they
can
never
give
a
reason
but
they
too
curse
the
emancipation
long
to
flog
the
niggers
and
hate
the
malays
who
work
harder
and
drink
and
who
are
the
only
masons
tailors
and
earn
from
to
a
day
the
malays
also
have
almost
a
monopoly
of
and
an
englishman
charges
or
for
a
carriage
to
do
what
a
malay
will
do
quicker
in
a
light
cart
for
says
english
here
think
the
coloured
people
ought
to
do
the
work
and
they
to
get
the
wages
nothing
less
would
satisfy
wages
are
high
but
other
wages
not
much
higher
than
in
england
yet
industrious
people
invariably
make
fortunes
or
at
least
competencies
even
when
they
begin
with
nothing
but
few
of
the
english
will
do
anything
but
lounge
while
they
abuse
the
dutch
as
lazy
and
the
malays
as
thieves
and
feel
their
fingers
itch
to
be
at
the
blacks
the
africanders
dutch
and
negro
mixed
in
various
proportions
are
more
or
less
lazy
dirty
and
dressy
and
the
beautiful
girls
wear
hats
and
look
very
winning
and
rather
fierce
but
to
them
the
philanthropists
at
home
have
provided
formidable
rivals
by
emptying
a
shipload
of
young
ladies
from
a
into
the
streets
of
capetown
i
am
puzzled
what
to
think
of
the
climate
here
for
invalids
the
air
is
dry
and
clear
beyond
conception
and
light
but
the
sun
is
scorching
while
the
wind
blows
an
icy
hurricane
and
the
dust
obscures
the
sky
these
winds
last
all
the
summer
till
february
or
march
i
am
told
when
they
blow
it
is
heavenly
though
still
cold
in
the
mornings
and
evenings
no
one
must
be
out
at
or
after
sunset
the
chill
is
so
sudden
many
of
the
people
here
declare
that
it
is
death
to
weak
lungs
and
send
their
to
madeira
or
the
south
of
france
they
also
swear
the
climate
is
enervating
but
their
looks
and
above
all
the
blowsy
cheeks
and
hearty
play
of
the
english
children
disprove
that
and
those
who
come
here
consumptive
get
well
in
spite
of
the
doctors
who
allow
it
possible
i
believe
it
is
a
climate
which
requires
great
care
from
invalids
but
that
with
care
it
is
good
because
it
is
bracing
as
well
as
warm
and
dry
it
is
not
nearly
so
warm
as
i
expected
the
southern
icebergs
are
at
no
great
distance
and
they
ice
the
wind
for
us
if
it
were
not
so
violent
it
would
be
delicious
and
there
are
no
unhealthy
like
our
east
wind
the
people
here
grumble
at
the
which
sometimes
brings
rain
and
call
it
damp
which
as
they
know
what
damp
is
is
excusable
it
feels
like
a
in
england
it
is
however
quite
a
delusion
to
think
of
living
out
of
doors
here
the
keep
one
in
nearly
if
not
quite
half
time
and
in
summer
they
say
the
sun
is
too
hot
to
be
out
except
morning
and
evening
but
i
doubt
that
for
they
make
an
outcry
about
heat
as
soon
as
it
is
not
cold
the
transitions
are
so
sudden
that
with
the
thermometer
at
you
must
not
go
out
without
taking
a
thick
warm
cloak
you
may
walk
into
a
round
the
first
spur
of
the
mountain
and
be
cut
in
two
in
short
the
air
is
cold
and
bracing
and
the
sun
blazing
hot
those
whom
that
suits
will
do
well
i
should
like
a
softer
air
but
i
may
be
wrong
when
there
is
only
a
moderate
wind
it
is
delicious
you
walk
in
the
hot
sun
which
makes
you
perspire
a
very
little
but
you
dry
as
you
go
the
air
is
so
dry
and
you
come
in
untired
i
speak
of
slow
walking
there
are
no
diseases
no
dysentery
fever
came
on
here
in
a
cart
as
i
felt
ill
from
the
return
of
the
cold
weather
while
at
rathfelder
we
had
a
superb
day
and
the
drove
me
over
to
constantia
which
deserves
all
its
reputation
for
beauty
what
a
divine
spot
kloofs
with
silver
rills
running
down
them
it
is
useless
to
describe
scenery
it
was
a
sort
of
glorified
scotland
with
sunshine
flowers
and
we
got
home
hungry
and
tired
but
in
great
spirits
alas
next
day
came
the
colder
more
cutting
than
lasted
a
week
the
walkers
came
over
on
horseback
and
pressed
me
to
go
to
them
they
are
most
kind
and
agreeable
people
the
drive
to
bay
was
lovely
along
the
coast
and
across
five
beaches
of
sand
which
look
like
winter
landscapes
and
the
mountains
and
bay
are
lovely
living
is
very
dear
and
washing
travelling
enormous
thirty
shillings
a
cart
and
horse
from
rathfelder
miles
and
then
the
young
english
host
wanted
me
to
hire
another
cart
for
one
box
and
one
bath
but
i
would
not
and
my
obstinacy
was
stoutest
if
i
want
cart
or
waggon
again
deal
with
a
malay
only
the
fellows
drive
with
forty
up
and
down
the
mountains
a
madagascar
woman
offered
to
give
me
her
orphan
grandchild
a
sweet
brown
fairy
six
years
old
with
long
silky
black
hair
and
gorgeous
eyes
the
child
hung
about
me
incessantly
all
the
time
i
was
at
rathfelder
and
i
had
a
great
mind
to
her
she
used
to
laugh
like
baby
and
was
like
her
altogether
only
prettier
and
very
brown
and
when
i
told
her
she
was
like
my
own
little
child
she
danced
about
and
laughed
like
mad
at
the
idea
that
she
could
look
like
white
she
was
mighty
proud
of
her
needlework
and
a
b
c
performances
it
is
such
a
luxury
to
sleep
on
a
real
stuffed
with
dirty
straw
to
eat
clean
food
and
live
in
a
nice
room
but
my
cough
is
very
bad
and
the
cruel
wind
blows
on
and
on
i
saw
the
doctor
of
the
naval
hospital
here
if
i
mend
i
will
try
his
advice
and
go
northward
for
warmth
if
you
can
find
an
old
mulready
envelope
send
it
here
to
miss
walker
who
collects
stamps
and
has
not
got
it
and
write
and
thank
dear
good
lady
walker
for
her
kindness
to
me
you
will
get
this
about
the
new
year
god
bless
you
all
and
send
us
better
days
in
letter
iv
journey
to
caledon
caledon
i
did
not
feel
at
all
well
at
bay
which
is
a
land
of
hurricanes
we
had
a
for
fourteen
days
without
an
lull
even
the
had
no
communication
with
the
shore
for
eight
days
the
good
old
naval
surgeon
there
ordered
me
to
start
off
for
this
high
district
and
arranged
my
departure
for
the
first
day
he
made
a
bargain
for
me
with
a
dutchman
for
a
light
malay
cart
a
capital
vehicle
with
two
wheels
and
four
horses
for
a
days
to
caledon
from
bay
about
a
hundred
miles
or
so
and
one
day
of
back
fare
to
his
home
in
capetown
luckily
on
saturday
the
wind
dropped
and
we
started
at
nine
drove
to
a
place
about
four
miles
from
capetown
when
we
turned
off
on
the
and
outspanned
at
a
kept
by
a
nice
old
german
with
a
dutch
wife
once
well
out
of
capetown
people
are
civil
but
inquisitive
i
was
strictly
and
proved
so
satisfactory
that
the
old
man
wished
to
give
me
some
english
porter
gratis
we
then
jogged
along
again
at
a
very
good
pace
to
another
wayside
public
where
we
outspanned
again
and
ate
and
were
again
questioned
and
again
made
much
of
by
six
we
got
to
the
eerste
river
having
gone
forty
miles
or
so
in
the
day
it
was
a
beautiful
day
and
very
pleasant
travelling
we
had
three
good
little
bays
and
one
brute
of
a
grey
as
who
fell
down
continually
but
a
malay
driver
works
miracles
and
no
harm
came
of
it
the
cart
is
small
with
a
permanent
tilt
at
top
and
moveable
curtains
of
waterproof
all
round
harness
of
raw
leather
very
prettily
put
together
by
malay
workmen
we
sat
behind
and
our
brown
coachman
with
his
mushroom
hat
in
front
with
my
bath
and
box
and
a
miniature
of
himself
about
seven
years
nephew
small
and
handy
that
he
would
be
worth
his
weight
in
jewels
as
a
tiger
at
eerste
river
we
slept
in
a
pretty
old
dutch
house
kept
by
an
english
woman
and
called
the
fox
and
hound
sound
like
home
my
very
nice
and
comfortable
it
was
i
started
next
day
at
ten
and
never
shall
i
forget
that
journey
the
beauty
of
the
country
exceeds
all
description
ranges
of
mountains
beyond
belief
fantastic
in
shape
and
between
them
a
rolling
country
desolate
and
wild
and
covered
with
gorgeous
flowers
among
the
first
we
came
to
holland
now
called
somerset
west
the
loveliest
little
old
dutch
village
with
trees
and
little
canals
of
bright
clear
mountain
water
and
groves
of
orange
and
pomegranate
and
white
houses
with
incredible
gable
ends
we
tried
to
stop
here
but
forage
was
ninepence
a
bundle
and
the
true
malay
would
rather
die
than
pay
more
than
he
can
help
so
we
pushed
on
to
the
foot
of
the
mountains
and
bought
forage
forage
is
oats
straw
and
all
the
only
feed
known
here
where
there
is
no
grass
or
hay
at
a
farm
kept
by
english
people
who
all
talked
dutch
together
only
one
girl
of
the
family
could
speak
english
they
were
very
civil
asked
us
in
and
gave
us
unripe
apricots
and
the
girl
came
down
with
seven
flounces
to
talk
with
us
forage
was
still
a
dollar
a
choslullah
jaamee
groaned
over
it
and
said
the
horses
must
have
less
forage
and
plenty
a
roll
in
the
dust
is
often
the
only
refreshment
offered
to
the
beasts
and
seems
to
do
great
good
we
got
to
caledon
at
eleven
and
drove
to
the
place
the
doctor
a
country
house
of
the
dutch
governor
it
is
in
a
lovely
spot
but
do
you
remember
the
schloss
in
neuer
m√ºnchausen
well
it
is
that
a
ruin
half
broken
and
boarded
up
the
handsome
steps
in
front
fallen
in
and
all
the
rooms
i
saw
were
large
and
airy
but
mud
floors
walls
one
chair
one
stump
bedstead
and
it
has
a
sort
of
wild
romantic
look
i
hear
too
it
is
wonderfully
healthy
and
not
so
bad
as
it
looks
the
long
corridor
is
like
the
entrance
to
a
great
stable
or
some
such
thing
earth
floors
and
open
to
all
winds
but
you
imagine
it
however
i
may
describe
it
is
so
huge
and
strange
and
ruinous
finding
that
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
ill
and
nothing
ready
for
our
reception
i
drove
on
to
the
inn
rain
like
a
scotch
mist
came
on
just
as
we
arrived
and
it
is
damp
and
chilly
to
the
delight
of
all
the
dwellers
in
the
land
who
love
bad
weather
it
makes
me
cough
a
little
more
but
they
say
it
is
quite
unheard
of
and
last
altogether
i
suppose
this
summer
here
is
as
that
of
was
in
england
i
forgot
in
describing
my
journey
the
caffre
housemaid
at
eerste
river
a
dear
good
creature
the
landlady
said
and
oh
such
a
a
cotton
handkerchief
folded
tight
like
a
cravat
and
tied
round
her
head
with
a
bow
behind
and
the
short
curly
wool
sticking
up
in
the
middle
looked
like
a
royal
diadem
on
her
solemn
brow
she
stepped
like
juno
with
a
huge
tub
full
to
the
brim
and
holding
several
pailfuls
on
her
head
and
a
pailful
in
each
hand
bringing
water
for
the
stables
from
the
river
across
a
large
field
there
is
nothing
like
a
caffre
for
power
and
grace
and
the
face
though
very
african
has
a
sort
of
grandeur
which
makes
it
utterly
unlike
that
of
the
negro
that
bust
and
waist
were
beauty
itself
the
caffres
are
also
very
clean
and
very
clever
as
servants
i
hear
learning
cookery
in
a
wonderfully
short
time
when
they
have
saved
money
enough
to
buy
cattle
in
kaffraria
off
they
go
cast
aside
civilization
and
clothes
and
enjoy
life
in
naked
luxury
i
tell
you
how
i
longed
for
you
in
my
journey
you
would
have
been
so
delighted
with
the
country
and
the
queer
wild
little
horses
and
the
polite
and
moslem
driver
his
description
of
his
sufferings
from
when
he
slept
in
a
dutch
farm
were
pathetic
and
ever
since
he
sleeps
in
his
cart
with
the
little
boy
and
they
bathe
in
the
nearest
river
and
eat
their
lawful
food
and
drink
their
water
out
of
doors
they
declined
beer
or
meat
which
had
been
unlawfully
killed
in
capetown
meat
is
killed
by
malays
and
has
the
proper
prayer
spoken
over
it
and
they
will
eat
no
other
i
was
offered
a
fowl
at
a
farm
but
choslullah
thought
it
much
money
for
and
only
accepted
some
eggs
he
was
gratified
at
my
recognising
the
propriety
of
his
saying
over
any
animal
killed
for
food
some
drink
beer
and
drink
a
good
deal
but
choslullah
thought
it
wrong
for
malay
people
and
not
good
for
christian
people
to
be
drunk
beasties
wine
or
beer
good
for
christians
but
not
too
plenty
i
gave
him
ten
shillings
for
himself
at
which
he
was
enchanted
and
again
begged
me
to
write
to
his
master
for
him
when
i
wanted
to
leave
caledon
and
to
be
sure
to
say
send
same
he
planned
to
drive
me
back
through
worcester
burnt
vley
paarl
and
longer
round
but
he
could
do
it
in
three
days
well
so
as
cost
missus
more
and
see
a
different
country
this
place
is
curiously
like
rochefort
in
the
ardennes
only
the
hills
are
mountains
and
the
sun
is
far
hotter
not
so
the
air
which
is
fresh
and
pleasant
i
am
in
a
very
nice
inn
kept
by
an
english
who
went
through
the
caffre
war
and
found
his
pay
insufficient
for
the
wants
of
a
numerous
family
i
quite
admire
his
wife
who
cooks
cleans
nurses
her
babes
gives
singing
and
music
lessons
as
merrily
as
if
she
liked
it
i
dine
with
them
at
two
and
captain
has
a
at
seven
for
travellers
i
pay
only
a
day
for
myself
and
this
includes
all
but
wine
or
beer
the
air
is
very
clear
and
fine
and
my
cough
is
already
much
better
i
shall
stay
here
as
long
as
it
suits
me
and
does
me
good
and
then
i
am
to
send
for
choslullah
again
and
go
back
by
the
road
he
proposed
it
rains
here
now
and
then
and
blows
a
good
deal
but
the
wind
has
lost
its
bitter
chill
and
depressing
quality
i
hope
soon
to
ride
a
little
and
see
the
country
which
is
beautiful
the
is
all
red
from
the
iron
stone
and
there
are
hot
chalybeate
springs
up
the
mountain
which
are
very
good
for
rheumatism
and
very
strengthening
i
am
told
the
boots
here
is
a
mantatee
very
black
and
called
kleenboy
because
he
is
so
little
he
is
the
only
sleek
black
i
have
seen
here
but
looks
heavy
and
downcast
one
maid
is
irish
they
make
the
best
servants
here
a
very
nice
clean
girl
and
the
other
a
brown
girl
of
fifteen
whose
father
is
english
and
married
to
her
mother
food
here
is
scarce
all
but
bread
and
mutton
both
good
butter
is
a
pound
fruit
and
vegetables
only
to
be
had
by
chance
i
miss
the
oranges
and
lemons
sadly
poultry
and
milk
uncertain
the
bread
is
good
everywhere
from
the
fine
wheat
in
the
country
it
is
brownish
and
sweet
the
wine
here
is
execrable
this
is
owing
to
the
prevailing
indolence
for
there
is
excellent
wine
made
from
the
rhenish
grape
rather
like
sauterne
with
a
of
manzanilla
flavour
the
sweet
constantia
is
also
very
good
indeed
not
the
expensive
sort
which
is
made
from
grapes
half
dried
and
is
a
liqueur
but
a
light
sweet
wine
which
even
i
liked
we
drank
nothing
else
at
the
the
kind
old
sailor
has
given
me
a
dozen
of
wine
which
is
coming
up
here
in
a
waggon
and
will
be
most
welcome
i
tell
you
how
kind
he
and
lady
walker
were
i
was
there
three
weeks
and
hope
to
go
again
when
the
season
is
over
and
i
can
get
out
a
little
i
could
not
leave
the
house
at
all
and
even
lady
walker
and
the
girls
who
are
very
energetic
got
out
but
little
they
are
a
charming
family
i
have
no
doubt
that
shea
was
right
and
that
one
must
leave
the
coast
to
get
a
fine
climate
here
it
seems
to
me
nearly
windy
for
my
pleasure
but
then
the
sun
would
be
overpowering
without
a
fresh
breeze
every
one
agrees
in
saying
that
the
winter
in
capetown
is
a
fine
english
summer
in
november
the
begin
and
they
are
this
year
they
began
in
september
the
mornings
here
are
always
fresh
not
to
say
cold
the
afternoons
from
one
to
three
broiling
then
delightful
till
sunset
which
is
deadly
cold
for
of
an
hour
the
night
is
lovely
the
wind
rises
and
falls
with
the
sun
that
is
the
general
course
of
things
now
and
then
it
rains
and
this
year
there
is
a
little
which
is
quite
unusual
and
not
odious
as
it
is
near
the
sea
and
there
is
seldom
a
hot
wind
from
the
north
i
am
promised
that
on
or
about
then
doors
and
windows
are
shut
and
you
gasp
hitherto
we
have
had
nothing
nearly
so
hot
as
paris
in
summer
or
as
the
summer
of
in
england
and
they
say
it
is
no
hotter
except
when
the
hot
wind
blows
which
is
very
rare
up
here
snow
sometimes
lies
in
winter
on
the
mountain
tops
but
ice
is
unknown
and
table
mountain
is
never
covered
with
snow
the
flies
are
noisy
intrusive
and
oh
such
swarms
fleas
and
bugs
not
half
so
bad
as
in
france
as
far
as
my
experience
goes
and
i
have
poked
about
in
queer
places
i
get
up
at
five
and
walk
in
the
early
morning
before
the
sun
and
wind
begin
to
be
oppressive
it
is
then
dry
calm
and
beautiful
then
i
sleep
like
a
dutchman
in
the
middle
of
the
day
at
present
it
tires
me
but
i
shall
get
used
to
it
soon
the
dutch
doctor
here
advised
me
to
do
so
to
avoid
the
wind
when
all
was
settled
we
climbed
the
mountains
by
sir
pass
a
long
curve
round
two
and
what
a
view
bay
opening
out
far
below
and
range
upon
range
of
crags
on
one
side
with
a
wide
fertile
plain
in
which
lies
holland
at
feet
the
road
is
just
wide
enough
for
one
waggon
very
narrow
where
the
smooth
rock
came
through
choslullah
gave
a
little
grunt
and
the
three
bays
went
off
like
hippogriffs
dragging
the
grey
with
them
by
this
time
my
confidence
in
his
driving
was
boundless
or
i
should
have
expected
to
find
myself
in
atoms
at
the
bottom
of
the
precipice
at
the
top
of
the
pass
we
turned
a
sharp
corner
into
a
scene
like
the
crater
of
a
volcano
only
reaching
miles
away
all
round
and
we
descended
a
very
little
and
drove
on
along
great
rolling
waves
of
country
with
the
mountain
tops
all
crags
and
ruins
to
our
left
at
three
we
reached
palmiet
river
full
of
palmettos
and
bamboos
and
there
the
horses
had
little
and
choslullah
and
his
miniature
washed
in
the
river
and
prayed
and
ate
dry
bread
and
drank
their
tepid
water
out
of
a
bottle
with
great
good
breeding
and
cheerfulness
three
had
outspanned
and
the
dutch
boers
and
bastaards
half
hottentots
were
all
drunk
we
went
into
a
neat
little
and
had
porter
and
ham
sandwiches
for
which
i
paid
to
a
english
woman
who
was
afraid
of
her
tipsy
customers
we
got
to
houw
hoek
a
pretty
valley
at
the
entrance
of
a
mountain
gorge
about
five
and
drove
up
to
a
mud
cottage
half
inn
half
farm
kept
by
a
german
and
his
wife
it
looked
mighty
queer
but
choslullah
said
the
host
was
a
good
old
man
and
all
clean
so
we
cheered
up
and
asked
for
food
while
the
neat
old
woman
was
cooking
it
up
galloped
five
fine
lads
and
two
pretty
girls
with
real
german
faces
on
wild
little
horses
and
one
girl
tucked
up
her
habit
and
waited
at
table
while
another
waved
a
green
bough
to
drive
off
the
swarms
of
flies
the
chops
were
excellent
ditto
bread
and
butter
and
the
tea
tolerable
the
parlour
was
a
tiny
room
with
a
mud
floor
door
into
the
front
and
the
two
bedrooms
still
tinier
and
darker
each
with
two
huge
beds
which
filled
them
entirely
but
choslullah
was
right
they
were
perfectly
clean
with
heaps
of
beautiful
pillows
and
not
only
none
of
the
creatures
of
which
he
spoke
with
infinite
terror
but
even
no
fleas
the
man
was
delighted
to
talk
to
me
his
wife
had
almost
forgotten
german
and
the
children
did
not
know
a
word
of
it
but
spoke
dutch
and
english
a
fine
healthy
happy
family
it
was
a
pretty
picture
of
emigrant
life
cattle
pigs
sheep
and
poultry
and
pigeons
innumerable
all
picked
up
their
own
living
and
cost
nothing
and
vegetables
and
fruit
grow
in
rank
abundance
where
there
is
water
i
asked
for
a
book
in
the
evening
and
the
man
gave
me
a
volume
of
schiller
a
good
breakfast
we
paid
ninepence
for
all
this
morning
we
started
before
eight
as
it
looked
gloomy
and
came
through
a
superb
mountain
defile
out
on
to
a
rich
hillocky
country
covered
with
miles
of
corn
all
being
cut
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
we
passed
several
circular
where
the
horses
tread
out
the
grain
each
had
a
few
mud
hovels
near
it
for
the
farmers
and
men
to
live
in
during
harvest
altogether
i
was
most
lucky
had
two
beautiful
days
and
enjoyed
the
journey
immensely
it
was
most
the
light
cart
with
four
wild
little
horses
and
the
marvellous
brown
driver
who
seemed
to
be
always
going
to
perdition
but
made
the
horses
do
apparently
impossible
things
with
absolute
certainty
and
the
pretty
tiny
boy
who
came
to
help
his
uncle
and
was
so
clever
and
so
preternaturally
quiet
and
so
very
small
then
the
road
through
the
mountain
passes
seven
or
eight
feet
wide
with
a
precipice
above
and
below
up
which
the
little
horses
scrambled
while
big
lizards
with
green
heads
and
chocolate
bodies
looked
pertly
at
us
and
a
big
bright
cobra
as
handsome
as
he
is
deadly
wriggled
across
into
a
hole
nearly
all
the
people
in
this
village
are
dutch
there
is
one
malay
tailor
here
but
he
is
obliged
to
be
a
christian
at
caledon
though
choslullah
told
me
with
a
grin
he
was
a
very
good
malay
when
he
went
to
capetown
he
did
not
seem
much
shocked
at
this
double
religion
staunch
mussulman
as
he
was
himself
i
suppose
the
blacks
are
what
dutch
slavery
made
and
sulky
the
real
hottentot
is
extinct
i
believe
in
the
colony
what
one
now
sees
are
all
the
dutch
name
for
their
own
descendants
by
hottentot
women
these
mongrel
hottentots
who
do
all
the
work
are
an
affliction
to
and
with
drink
and
drunk
all
day
long
sullen
wretched
unlike
the
bright
malays
and
cheery
pleasant
blacks
and
browns
of
capetown
who
never
pass
you
without
a
kind
word
and
sunny
smile
or
broad
african
grin
their
colour
and
shape
of
face
i
look
back
fondly
to
the
gracious
malagasse
woman
who
used
to
give
me
a
chair
under
the
big
tree
near
rathfelders
and
a
cup
of
herb
tea
and
talk
so
prettily
in
her
soft
voice
is
such
a
contrast
to
these
poor
animals
who
glower
at
one
quite
unpleasantly
all
the
hovels
i
was
in
at
capetown
were
very
fairly
clean
and
i
went
into
numbers
they
almost
all
contained
a
handsome
bed
with
at
least
eight
pillows
if
you
only
look
at
the
door
with
a
friendly
glance
you
are
implored
to
come
in
and
sit
down
and
usually
offered
a
cup
of
herb
tea
which
they
are
quite
grateful
to
one
for
drinking
i
never
saw
or
heard
a
hint
of
nor
did
i
ever
give
it
on
principle
and
i
was
always
recognised
and
invited
to
come
again
with
the
greatest
eagerness
indulgence
of
from
an
english
seemed
the
height
of
gratification
and
the
pride
and
pleasure
of
giving
hospitality
a
sufficient
reward
but
here
it
is
quite
different
i
suppose
the
benefits
of
the
emancipation
were
felt
at
capetown
sooner
than
in
the
country
and
the
malay
population
there
furnishes
a
strong
element
of
sobriety
and
respectability
which
sets
an
example
to
the
other
coloured
people
harvest
is
now
going
on
and
the
hottentots
are
earning
a
day
with
rations
and
wine
but
all
the
money
goes
at
the
in
drink
and
the
poor
wretched
men
and
women
look
wasted
and
degraded
the
children
are
pretty
and
a
few
of
them
are
girls
who
do
very
well
unless
a
white
man
admires
them
and
then
they
think
it
quite
an
honour
to
have
a
child
which
happens
at
about
fifteen
by
which
age
they
look
full
twenty
we
had
very
good
snipe
and
wild
duck
the
other
day
which
capt
brought
home
from
a
shooting
party
i
have
got
the
wings
of
a
golden
snipe
for
hat
and
those
of
a
beautiful
they
got
no
because
of
the
violent
which
blew
where
they
were
the
game
is
fast
decreasing
but
still
very
abundant
i
saw
plenty
of
partridges
on
the
road
but
was
not
early
enough
to
see
boks
who
only
show
at
dawn
neither
have
i
seen
baboons
i
will
try
to
bring
home
some
cages
of
canaries
and
red
bills
darling
little
things
the
which
are
the
of
africa
could
not
be
fed
but
caffre
finks
which
weave
the
pendent
nests
are
hardy
and
easily
fed
the
post
for
england
leaves
caledon
so
i
must
conclude
this
yarn
i
wish
could
have
seen
the
the
mountain
deer
of
south
africa
which
capt
brought
in
to
show
me
such
a
lovely
little
beast
as
big
as
a
small
kid
with
eyes
and
ears
like
a
hare
and
a
nose
so
small
and
dainty
it
was
quite
tame
and
saucy
and
belonged
to
some
man
for
capetown
letter
v
caledon
caledon
i
am
beginning
now
really
to
feel
better
i
think
my
cough
is
less
and
i
eat
a
great
deal
more
they
cook
nice
clean
food
here
and
have
some
good
claret
which
i
have
been
extravagant
enough
to
drink
much
to
my
advantage
the
cape
wine
is
all
so
fiery
the
climate
is
improving
too
the
glorious
african
sun
blazes
and
roasts
one
and
the
cool
fresh
breezes
prevent
one
from
feeling
languid
i
walk
from
six
till
eight
or
nine
breakfast
at
ten
and
dine
at
three
in
the
afternoon
it
is
generally
practicable
to
saunter
again
now
the
weather
is
warmer
i
sleep
from
twelve
till
two
on
it
was
so
warm
that
i
lay
in
bed
with
the
window
wide
open
and
the
stars
blazing
in
such
stars
they
are
much
brighter
than
our
moon
the
dutchmen
held
high
jinks
in
the
hall
and
danced
and
made
a
great
noise
on
new
they
will
have
another
ball
and
i
shall
look
in
was
the
hottest
the
only
day
we
have
i
could
not
make
it
out
at
all
or
fancy
you
all
cold
at
home
i
wish
you
were
here
to
see
the
curious
ways
and
new
aspect
of
everything
this
village
which
as
i
have
said
is
very
like
rochefort
but
hardly
so
large
is
the
of
a
district
the
size
of
of
england
a
civil
commander
resides
here
a
sort
of
and
there
is
an
embryo
with
a
bell
hanging
in
a
brick
arch
when
a
waggon
arrives
with
goods
it
draws
up
there
they
ring
the
bell
everybody
goes
to
see
what
is
for
sale
and
the
goods
are
sold
by
auction
my
host
bought
potatoes
and
brandy
the
other
day
and
is
looking
out
for
ostrich
feathers
for
me
out
of
the
hats
the
other
day
while
we
sat
at
dinner
all
the
bells
began
to
ring
furiously
and
capt
jumped
up
and
shouted
fire
rushed
off
for
a
stout
leather
hat
and
ran
down
the
street
out
came
all
the
population
black
white
and
brown
awfully
excited
for
it
was
blowing
a
furious
right
up
the
town
and
the
fire
was
at
the
bottom
and
as
every
house
is
thatched
with
a
dry
brown
thatch
we
might
all
have
to
turn
out
and
see
the
place
in
ashes
in
less
than
an
hour
luckily
it
was
put
out
directly
it
is
supposed
to
have
been
set
on
fire
by
a
hottentot
girl
who
has
done
the
same
thing
once
before
on
being
scolded
there
is
no
water
but
what
runs
down
the
streets
in
the
a
paved
channel
which
brings
the
water
from
the
mountain
and
supplies
the
houses
and
gardens
a
garden
is
impossible
without
irrigation
of
course
as
it
never
rains
but
with
it
you
may
have
everything
all
the
year
round
the
people
however
are
too
careless
to
grow
fruit
and
vegetables
how
the
cattle
live
is
a
standing
marvel
to
me
the
whole
common
which
extends
all
over
the
country
just
dotted
with
a
few
square
miles
of
corn
here
and
there
is
covered
with
a
low
thin
scrub
about
eighteen
inches
high
called
like
meagre
arbor
vit√¶
or
pale
juniper
the
cattle
and
sheep
will
not
touch
this
nor
the
juicy
hottentot
fig
but
under
each
little
bush
i
fancy
they
crop
a
few
blades
of
grass
and
on
this
they
keep
in
very
good
condition
the
noble
oxen
with
their
huge
horns
nine
or
ten
feet
from
tip
to
tip
are
never
fed
though
they
work
hard
nor
are
the
sheep
the
horses
get
a
little
forage
oats
straw
and
all
i
should
like
you
to
see
eight
or
ten
of
these
swift
wiry
little
horses
harnessed
to
a
waggon
mere
flat
platform
on
wheels
in
front
stands
a
hottentot
all
patches
and
feathers
and
drives
them
best
pace
all
using
a
whip
like
a
with
which
he
touches
them
not
savagely
but
with
a
skill
which
would
make
an
old
burst
with
envy
to
behold
this
morning
out
on
the
veld
i
watched
the
process
of
a
couple
of
colts
who
were
harnessed
after
many
struggles
second
and
fourth
in
a
team
of
ten
in
front
stood
a
tiny
foal
cuddling
its
mother
one
of
the
leaders
when
they
started
the
foal
had
its
neck
through
the
bridle
and
i
hallooed
in
a
fright
but
the
hottentot
only
laughed
and
in
a
minute
it
had
disengaged
itself
quite
coolly
and
capered
alongside
the
colts
tried
to
plunge
but
were
whisked
along
and
and
then
they
stuck
out
all
four
feet
and
along
a
bit
but
the
rhenoster
bushes
tripped
them
up
people
drive
regardless
of
roads
and
they
shook
their
heads
and
trotted
along
quite
subdued
without
a
blow
or
a
word
for
the
drivers
never
speak
to
the
horses
only
to
the
oxen
colts
here
get
no
other
breaking
and
therefore
have
no
paces
or
action
to
the
eye
but
their
speed
and
endurance
are
wonderful
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
in
the
country
and
the
waggon
teams
of
wiry
little
thoroughbreds
half
arab
look
very
strange
to
our
eyes
going
full
tilt
there
is
a
terrible
murrain
called
the
among
horses
and
oxen
here
every
four
or
five
years
but
it
never
touches
those
that
are
stabled
however
exposed
to
wet
or
wind
on
the
roads
i
must
describe
the
house
i
inhabit
as
all
are
much
alike
it
is
whitewashed
with
a
door
in
the
middle
and
two
windows
on
each
side
those
on
the
left
are
bed
and
sitting
rooms
on
the
right
is
a
large
room
which
is
mine
in
the
middle
of
the
house
is
a
spacious
hall
with
doors
into
other
rooms
on
each
side
and
into
the
kitchen
there
is
a
yard
behind
and
a
staircase
up
to
the
or
loft
under
the
thatch
with
partitions
where
the
servants
and
children
and
sometimes
guests
sleep
there
are
no
ceilings
the
floor
of
the
zolder
is
made
of
yellow
wood
and
resting
on
beams
forms
the
ceiling
of
my
room
and
the
thatch
alone
covers
that
no
moss
ever
grows
on
the
thatch
which
is
brown
with
white
ridges
in
front
is
a
stoep
with
australian
in
front
of
it
where
i
sit
till
twelve
when
the
sun
comes
on
it
these
trees
prevail
here
greatly
as
they
want
neither
water
nor
anything
else
and
grow
with
incredible
rapidity
we
have
got
a
new
all
coloured
servants
are
remnant
of
slavery
and
he
is
the
type
of
the
nigger
slave
a
thief
a
liar
a
glutton
a
you
resent
it
he
has
a
buffoonery
a
total
want
of
which
disarms
you
i
sent
him
to
the
post
to
inquire
for
letters
and
the
postmaster
had
been
tipsy
and
was
not
awake
jack
came
back
spluttering
threats
against
domned
dutchman
me
no
like
him
me
go
and
kick
up
row
what
for
he
no
give
missis
letter
i
begged
him
to
be
patient
on
which
he
bonneted
himself
in
a
violent
way
and
started
off
at
a
pantomime
walk
jack
is
the
product
of
slavery
he
pretends
to
be
a
simpleton
in
order
to
do
less
work
and
eat
and
drink
and
sleep
more
than
a
reasonable
being
and
he
knows
his
buffoonery
will
get
him
out
of
scrapes
withal
thoroughly
and
obliging
and
perfectly
honest
except
where
food
and
drink
are
concerned
which
he
pilfers
like
a
monkey
he
worships
and
allow
her
to
carry
anything
or
to
dirty
her
hands
if
he
is
in
the
way
to
do
it
some
one
suggested
to
him
to
kiss
her
but
he
declined
with
terror
and
said
he
should
be
hanged
by
my
orders
if
he
did
he
is
a
hideous
little
negro
with
a
head
every
colour
of
the
rainbow
on
his
clothes
and
a
power
of
making
faces
which
would
enchant
a
schoolboy
the
height
of
his
ambition
would
be
to
go
to
england
with
me
an
old
woman
married
to
the
malay
tailor
here
explained
to
me
my
popularity
with
the
coloured
people
as
set
forth
by
malay
my
driver
he
told
them
he
was
sure
i
was
a
great
because
of
my
good
that
i
spoke
to
him
just
as
to
a
white
gentleman
and
did
not
and
talk
nonsense
say
you
black
dat
the
english
when
they
mean
to
be
are
generally
offensively
familiar
and
nonsense
imitate
the
dutch
english
of
the
malays
and
blacks
the
latter
feel
it
the
greatest
compliment
to
be
treated
and
spoken
to
in
good
english
theory
was
that
i
must
be
related
to
the
queen
in
consequence
of
my
not
bad
the
malays
who
are
intelligent
and
proud
of
course
feel
the
annoyance
of
vulgar
familiarity
more
than
the
blacks
who
are
rather
by
civility
though
they
like
and
admire
it
tells
me
that
the
coloured
with
all
their
faults
are
immaculately
honest
in
these
parts
and
indeed
as
every
door
and
window
is
always
left
open
even
when
every
soul
is
out
and
nothing
locked
up
there
must
be
no
thieves
captain
told
me
he
had
been
in
remote
dutch
farmhouses
where
rouleaux
of
gold
were
ranged
under
the
thatch
on
the
top
of
the
low
wall
the
doors
being
always
left
open
and
everywhere
the
dutch
boers
keep
their
money
by
them
in
coin
have
had
tremendous
festivities
ball
on
new
and
another
on
the
of
the
shooting
for
prince
rifle
yesterday
the
difficulty
of
music
for
the
ball
was
solved
by
the
arrival
of
two
malay
bricklayers
to
build
the
new
parsonage
and
i
heard
with
my
own
ears
the
proof
of
what
i
had
been
told
as
to
their
extraordinary
musical
gifts
when
i
went
into
the
hall
a
dutchman
was
a
concertina
hideously
presently
in
walked
a
yellow
malay
with
a
blue
cotton
handkerchief
on
his
head
and
a
of
negro
blood
very
dark
brown
with
a
red
handkerchief
and
holding
a
rough
tambourine
the
handsome
yellow
man
took
the
concertina
which
seemed
so
discordant
and
the
touch
of
his
dainty
fingers
transformed
it
to
harmony
he
played
dances
with
a
precision
and
feeling
quite
unequalled
except
by
band
and
a
variety
which
seemed
endless
i
asked
him
if
he
could
read
music
at
which
he
laughed
heartily
and
said
music
came
into
the
ears
not
the
eyes
he
had
picked
it
all
up
from
the
bands
in
capetown
or
elsewhere
it
was
a
strange
sight
picturesque
group
and
the
contrast
between
the
quiet
manners
of
the
true
malay
and
the
grotesque
fun
of
the
the
latter
made
his
tambourine
do
duty
as
a
drum
rattled
the
bits
of
brass
so
as
to
produce
an
indescribable
effect
nodded
and
grinned
in
wild
excitement
and
drank
beer
while
his
comrade
took
water
the
dancing
was
uninteresting
enough
the
dutchmen
danced
badly
and
said
not
a
word
but
plodded
on
so
as
to
get
all
the
dancing
they
could
for
their
money
i
went
to
bed
at
eleven
but
the
ball
went
on
till
four
next
night
there
was
genteeler
company
and
i
did
not
go
in
but
lay
in
bed
listening
to
the
playing
he
had
quite
a
fresh
set
of
tunes
of
which
several
were
from
the
yesterday
was
a
real
african
day
the
had
a
tent
and
an
awning
one
for
food
and
the
other
for
drink
on
the
ground
where
the
shooting
took
place
at
twelve
went
down
to
sell
cold
chickens
and
i
went
with
her
and
sat
under
a
tree
in
the
bed
of
the
little
stream
now
nearly
dry
the
sun
was
such
as
in
any
other
climate
would
strike
you
down
but
here
de
is
unknown
it
broils
you
till
your
shoulders
ache
and
your
lips
crack
but
it
does
not
make
you
feel
the
least
languid
and
you
perspire
very
little
nor
does
it
tan
the
skin
as
you
would
expect
the
light
of
the
sun
is
by
no
means
is
pure
the
slightest
shade
of
a
tree
or
bush
affords
a
delicious
temperature
so
light
and
fresh
is
the
air
they
said
the
thermometer
was
at
about
where
i
was
walking
yesterday
but
barring
the
scorch
i
could
not
have
believed
it
it
was
a
very
amusing
day
the
great
tall
dutchmen
came
in
to
shoot
and
did
but
moderately
i
thought
the
longest
range
was
five
hundred
yards
and
at
that
they
shot
well
at
shorter
ranges
poorly
enough
the
best
man
made
ten
points
but
oh
what
figures
were
there
of
negroes
and
coloured
people
i
longed
for
a
photographer
some
coloured
lads
were
exquisitely
graceful
and
composed
beautiful
after
a
poor
little
very
old
bosjesman
crept
up
and
was
jeered
and
bullied
i
scolded
the
lad
who
abused
him
for
being
rude
to
an
old
man
whereupon
the
poor
little
old
creature
squatted
on
the
ground
close
by
for
which
he
would
have
been
kicked
but
for
me
took
off
his
ragged
hat
and
sat
staring
and
nodding
his
small
grey
woolly
head
at
me
and
jabbering
some
little
soliloquy
very
there
was
something
shocking
in
the
timidity
with
which
he
took
the
plate
of
food
i
gave
him
and
in
the
way
in
which
he
ate
it
with
the
side
of
his
little
yellow
hand
like
a
monkey
a
black
who
had
helped
to
fetch
the
hamper
suggested
to
me
to
give
him
wine
instead
of
meat
and
bread
and
make
him
drunk
the
blacks
and
hottentots
copy
the
white
manners
when
they
get
hold
of
a
bosjesman
to
practise
upon
but
upon
this
a
handsome
west
indian
black
who
had
been
cooking
pies
fired
up
and
told
him
he
was
a
black
rascal
and
a
dutchman
to
to
insult
a
lady
and
an
old
man
at
once
if
you
could
see
the
difference
between
one
negro
and
another
you
would
be
quite
convinced
that
education
circumstances
makes
the
race
it
was
hardly
conceivable
that
the
hideous
dirty
ragged
creature
who
looked
down
on
the
bosjesman
and
the
smart
fellow
with
his
fine
eyes
jaunty
red
cap
and
shirt
and
trousers
alert
as
the
best
german
kellner
were
of
the
same
blood
nothing
but
the
colour
was
alike
then
came
a
dutchman
and
asked
for
six
of
en
and
haggled
for
beer
and
englishmen
who
bought
chickens
and
champagne
without
asking
the
price
one
rich
old
boer
got
three
lunches
and
then
made
off
without
paying
at
all
then
came
a
hottentot
stupidly
drunk
with
a
fiddle
and
was
beaten
by
a
little
scotchman
and
his
fiddle
smashed
the
hottentot
hit
at
his
aggressor
who
then
declared
he
a
policeman
and
insisted
on
taking
him
into
custody
and
to
the
prison
on
his
own
authority
but
was
in
turn
sent
flying
by
a
gigantic
irishman
who
see
the
poor
baste
the
irishman
was
a
farmer
i
never
saw
such
a
beaming
with
fun
and
good
nature
he
was
very
civil
and
answered
my
questions
and
talked
like
an
intelligent
man
but
when
captain
asked
him
with
an
air
of
some
anxiety
if
he
was
coming
to
the
hotel
he
replied
sir
no
i
be
guilty
of
such
a
misdemeanour
i
am
aware
that
i
was
a
disgrace
and
opprobrium
to
your
house
sir
last
time
i
was
there
sir
no
sir
i
shall
sleep
in
my
cart
and
not
come
into
the
presence
of
hereupon
he
departed
and
i
was
informed
that
he
had
been
drunk
for
seventeen
days
on
his
last
visit
to
caledon
however
he
kept
quite
sober
on
this
occasion
and
amused
himself
by
making
the
little
blackies
scramble
for
halfpence
in
the
pools
left
in
the
bed
of
the
river
among
our
customers
was
a
very
handsome
black
man
with
high
straight
nose
eyes
and
a
small
mouth
smartly
dressed
in
a
white
felt
hat
paletot
and
trousers
he
is
the
shoemaker
and
is
making
a
pair
of
for
you
which
you
will
delight
in
they
are
what
the
rough
boers
and
hottentots
wear
barbarously
tanned
and
shaped
and
as
soft
as
woollen
socks
the
name
is
moor
and
his
father
told
him
he
came
of
a
that
was
all
he
knew
a
very
pleasing
english
farmer
who
had
been
educated
in
belgium
came
and
ordered
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
shyly
begged
me
to
drink
a
glass
whereupon
we
talked
of
crops
and
the
like
and
an
excellent
specimen
of
a
colonist
he
appeared
very
gentle
and
unaffected
with
homely
good
sense
and
real
good
a
contrast
to
the
pert
airs
and
vulgarity
of
capetown
and
of
the
people
in
colonial
high
places
finding
we
had
no
carriage
he
posted
off
and
borrowed
a
cart
of
one
man
and
harness
of
another
and
put
his
and
his
riding
horses
to
it
to
take
and
me
home
as
it
was
still
early
he
took
us
a
and
oh
ye
gods
what
a
terrific
and
dislocating
pleasure
was
that
at
a
hard
gallop
with
the
mildest
and
steadiest
air
and
with
perfect
safety
took
us
right
across
country
it
is
true
there
were
no
fences
but
over
bushes
ditches
lumps
of
rock
watercourses
we
jumped
flew
and
bounded
and
up
every
hill
we
went
racing
pace
i
arrived
at
home
much
bewildered
and
feeling
more
like
lenore
than
anything
else
till
i
saw
steady
pleasant
face
quite
undisturbed
and
was
informed
that
such
was
the
way
of
driving
of
cape
farmers
we
found
the
luckless
jack
in
such
a
state
of
furious
drunkenness
that
he
had
to
be
dismissed
on
the
spot
not
without
threats
of
the
and
once
more
kleenboy
fills
the
office
of
boots
he
returned
in
a
ludicrous
state
of
penitence
and
emaciation
frankly
admitting
that
it
was
better
to
work
hard
and
get
than
to
work
less
and
get
none
however
protesting
against
work
at
all
the
last
four
days
it
has
again
been
blowing
a
wintry
hurricane
every
one
says
that
the
continuance
of
these
winds
so
late
into
the
summer
this
answers
to
july
is
unheard
of
and
cease
soon
in
table
bay
i
hear
a
good
deal
of
mischief
has
been
done
to
the
shipping
i
hope
my
long
yarns
bore
you
i
put
down
what
seems
new
and
amusing
to
me
at
the
moment
but
by
the
time
it
reaches
you
it
will
seem
very
dull
and
commonplace
i
hear
that
the
scotchman
who
attacked
poor
aria
the
crazy
hottentot
is
a
and
was
exhorting
him
to
break
his
fiddle
and
come
to
the
phrase
is
a
i
beg
to
observe
and
the
saints
are
indignant
that
after
executing
the
pious
purpose
as
far
as
the
fiddle
went
he
was
prevented
by
the
chief
constable
from
dragging
him
to
the
tronk
the
mania
has
broken
out
rather
violently
in
some
places
the
infection
was
brought
from
helena
i
am
told
at
capetown
old
abdool
jemaalee
told
me
that
english
christians
were
getting
more
like
malays
and
had
begun
to
hold
at
bay
these
are
festivals
in
which
mussulman
fanatics
run
knives
into
their
flesh
go
into
convulsions
c
to
the
sound
of
music
like
the
arab
described
by
houdin
of
course
the
poor
blacks
go
quite
demented
i
intend
to
stay
here
another
two
or
three
weeks
and
then
to
go
to
a
bit
paarl
ditto
stellenbosch
go
to
capetown
early
in
march
and
in
april
to
embark
for
home
mail
in
yet
we
have
had
beautiful
weather
the
last
three
days
captain
has
been
in
capetown
and
bought
a
horse
which
he
rode
home
miles
in
a
day
and
a
half
beast
none
the
worse
nor
tired
i
am
to
ride
him
and
so
shall
see
the
country
if
the
vile
cold
winds
keep
off
this
morning
i
walked
on
the
veld
and
met
a
young
black
shepherd
leading
his
sheep
and
goats
and
playing
on
a
guitar
composed
of
an
old
tin
mug
covered
with
a
bit
of
sheepskin
and
a
handle
of
rough
wood
with
pegs
and
three
strings
of
i
asked
him
to
sing
and
he
flung
himself
at
my
feet
in
an
attitude
that
would
make
watts
crazy
with
delight
and
queer
little
mournful
ditties
i
gave
him
sixpence
and
told
him
not
to
get
drunk
he
said
no
i
will
buy
bread
enough
to
make
my
belly
almost
never
had
my
belly
he
likewise
informed
me
he
had
just
been
in
the
tronk
prison
and
on
my
asking
why
replied
for
fighting
and
telling
lies
die
liebe
unschuld
dear
innocence
hottentot
figs
are
rather
green
thing
containing
about
a
spoonful
of
insipid
glue
which
you
suck
out
this
does
not
sound
nice
but
it
is
the
plant
has
a
thick
succulent
triangular
leaf
creeping
on
the
ground
and
growing
anywhere
without
earth
or
water
figs
proper
are
common
here
but
tasteless
and
the
people
pick
all
their
fruit
green
and
eat
it
so
too
the
children
are
all
crunching
hard
peaches
and
plums
just
now
particularly
some
little
near
here
who
are
frightfully
ugly
fancy
the
children
of
a
black
woman
and
a
man
the
little
monsters
are
as
black
as
the
mother
and
have
never
saw
so
diabolical
an
appearance
some
of
the
coloured
people
are
very
pretty
for
example
a
girl
of
seventeen
and
my
washerwoman
who
is
brown
they
are
wonderfully
slender
and
agile
and
quite
old
women
have
waists
you
could
span
they
never
grow
thick
and
square
like
europeans
i
could
write
a
volume
on
cape
horses
such
valiant
little
beasts
and
so
composed
in
temper
i
never
saw
they
are
nearly
all
few
very
dark
grey
which
are
esteemed
few
white
or
light
grey
i
have
seen
no
black
and
only
one
dark
chestnut
they
are
not
cobs
and
look
little
of
and
have
no
beauty
but
one
of
these
little
brutes
ungroomed
seldom
stabled
will
carry
a
dutchman
sixty
miles
a
day
day
after
day
at
a
shuffling
easy
canter
six
miles
an
hour
you
every
three
hours
and
let
him
roll
you
also
let
him
drink
all
he
can
get
his
coat
shines
and
his
eye
is
bright
and
unsoundness
is
very
rare
they
are
never
properly
broke
and
the
colts
are
sometimes
made
vicious
by
the
cruel
bits
and
heavy
hands
but
by
nature
their
temper
is
perfect
every
morning
all
the
horses
in
the
village
are
turned
loose
and
a
general
gallop
takes
place
to
the
water
tank
where
they
drink
and
lounge
a
little
and
the
young
ones
are
fetched
home
by
their
niggers
while
the
old
stagers
know
they
will
be
wanted
and
saunter
off
by
themselves
i
often
attend
the
houyhnhnm
at
the
tank
at
about
seven
and
am
amused
by
their
behaviour
and
i
continually
wish
i
could
see
face
on
witnessing
many
equine
proceedings
here
to
see
a
farmer
outspan
and
turn
the
team
of
active
little
beasts
loose
on
the
boundless
veld
to
amuse
themselves
for
an
hour
or
two
sure
that
they
will
all
be
there
would
astonish
him
a
little
and
then
to
offer
a
horse
nothing
but
a
roll
in
the
dust
to
refresh
himself
withal
one
unpleasant
sight
here
is
the
skeletons
of
horses
and
oxen
along
the
roadside
or
at
times
a
fresh
carcase
surrounded
by
a
convocation
of
huge
carrion
crows
with
neat
white
the
skeletons
look
like
wrecks
and
make
you
feel
very
lonely
on
the
wide
veld
in
this
district
and
in
most
i
believe
the
roads
are
mere
tracks
over
the
hard
level
earth
and
very
good
they
are
when
one
gets
rutty
you
drive
parallel
to
it
till
the
bush
is
worn
out
and
a
new
track
is
formed
weather
all
the
week
summer
well
set
in
letter
vi
caledon
caledon
january
dearest
mother
till
this
last
week
the
weather
was
pertinaciously
cold
and
windy
and
i
had
resolved
to
go
to
worcester
which
lies
in
a
and
is
really
hot
but
now
the
glorious
african
summer
is
come
and
i
believe
this
is
the
weather
of
paradise
i
got
up
at
four
this
morning
when
the
dutchmen
who
had
slept
here
were
starting
in
their
carts
and
waggons
it
was
quite
light
but
the
moon
shone
brilliantly
still
and
had
put
on
a
bright
veil
borrowed
from
the
rising
sun
on
the
opposite
horizon
the
freshness
without
a
shadow
of
cold
or
damp
of
the
air
was
dew
was
on
the
ground
i
went
up
the
along
the
channel
which
supplies
all
our
water
into
the
between
the
mountains
and
clambered
up
to
the
from
which
natural
window
the
view
is
very
fine
the
flowers
are
all
gone
and
the
grass
all
dead
rhenoster
boschjes
and
hottentot
fig
are
green
everywhere
and
among
the
rocks
all
manner
of
shrubs
and
far
too
much
een
a
a
sort
of
series
of
natural
which
try
the
robustest
patience
between
seven
and
eight
the
sun
gets
rather
hot
and
i
came
in
and
and
sat
on
the
stoep
a
sort
of
terrace
in
front
of
every
house
in
south
africa
i
breakfast
at
nine
sit
on
the
stoep
again
till
the
sun
comes
round
and
then
retreat
behind
closed
shutters
from
the
stinging
sun
the
is
fresh
and
light
all
day
though
the
sun
is
tremendous
but
one
has
no
languid
feeling
or
desire
to
lie
about
unless
one
is
sleepy
we
dine
at
two
or
and
at
four
or
five
the
heat
is
over
and
one
puts
on
a
shawl
to
go
out
in
the
afternoon
breeze
the
nights
are
cool
so
as
always
to
want
one
blanket
i
still
have
a
cough
but
it
is
getting
better
so
that
i
can
always
eat
and
walk
mine
host
has
just
bought
a
horse
which
he
is
going
to
try
with
a
petticoat
and
if
he
goes
well
i
shall
ride
i
like
this
because
i
see
all
the
and
i
like
far
better
than
the
of
capetown
i
have
given
letters
to
england
to
a
who
is
to
europe
the
of
his
race
since
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
when
some
poor
refugees
were
inveigled
hither
by
the
dutch
governor
and
oppressed
worse
than
the
hottentots
de
villiers
has
had
no
education
and
has
worked
and
traded
and
farmed
the
breed
tells
he
is
a
pure
and
thorough
frenchman
unable
to
speak
a
word
of
french
when
i
went
in
to
dinner
he
rose
and
gave
me
a
chair
with
a
bow
which
with
his
appearance
made
me
ask
vient
this
at
once
put
him
out
and
pleased
him
he
is
very
unlike
a
dutchman
if
you
think
that
any
of
the
french
will
feel
as
i
felt
to
this
brother
of
theirs
pray
give
him
a
few
letters
but
remember
that
he
can
speak
only
english
and
dutch
and
a
little
german
here
his
name
is
but
i
told
him
to
drop
that
barbarism
in
europe
de
villiers
ought
to
speak
for
itself
he
says
they
came
from
the
neighbourhood
of
bordeaux
the
postmaster
heer
klein
and
his
old
pylades
heer
ley
are
great
cronies
of
old
greybeards
toddling
down
the
hill
together
i
sometimes
go
and
sit
on
the
stoep
with
the
two
old
bachelors
and
they
take
it
as
a
great
compliment
and
heer
klein
gave
me
my
letters
all
decked
with
flowers
and
wished
tydings
mevrouw
most
heartily
he
has
also
made
his
tributary
hottentots
bring
from
various
higher
mountain
ranges
the
beautiful
everlasting
flowers
which
will
make
pretty
wreaths
for
when
i
went
to
his
house
to
thank
him
i
found
a
handsome
malay
with
a
basket
of
a
much
esteemed
here
old
klein
told
me
they
were
sent
him
by
a
malay
who
was
born
in
his
house
a
slave
and
had
been
and
now
the
slave
is
far
richer
than
the
old
young
master
and
no
waggon
comes
without
a
little
fish
when
klein
goes
to
capetown
the
old
malay
seats
him
in
a
grand
chair
and
sits
on
a
little
wooden
stool
at
his
feet
klein
begs
him
as
to
sit
properly
but
wilhem
ik
zal
niet
ik
kan
niet
boy
said
old
klein
people
the
it
is
a
relief
after
the
horrors
one
has
heard
of
dutch
cruelty
to
see
such
an
i
have
heard
other
instances
of
the
same
fidelity
from
malays
but
they
were
utterly
unappreciated
and
only
told
to
prove
the
excellence
of
slavery
and
well
the
rascals
must
have
been
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
a
hottentot
baby
here
her
mother
is
all
black
with
a
broad
face
and
soft
spaniel
eyes
and
the
father
is
bastaard
but
the
baby
a
girl
nine
months
old
has
walked
out
of
one
of
leonardo
da
pictures
i
never
saw
so
beautiful
a
child
she
has
huge
eyes
with
the
spiritual
look
he
gives
to
them
and
is
exquisite
in
every
way
when
the
hottentot
blood
is
handsome
it
is
beautiful
there
is
a
delicacy
and
softness
about
some
of
the
women
which
is
very
pretty
and
the
eyes
are
those
of
a
dog
most
of
them
are
hideous
and
nearly
all
drink
but
they
are
very
clean
and
honest
their
cottages
are
far
superior
in
cleanliness
to
anything
out
of
england
except
in
picked
places
like
some
parts
of
belgium
and
they
wash
as
much
as
they
can
with
the
bad
and
the
english
outcry
if
they
strip
out
of
doors
to
bathe
compared
to
french
peasants
they
are
very
clean
indeed
and
even
the
children
are
far
more
decent
and
cleanly
in
their
habits
than
those
of
france
the
woman
who
comes
here
to
clean
and
scour
is
a
model
of
neatness
in
her
work
and
her
person
quite
black
but
she
gets
helplessly
drunk
as
soon
as
she
has
a
penny
to
buy
a
glass
of
wine
for
a
penny
a
tumbler
of
very
strong
and
remarkably
nasty
wine
is
sold
at
the
canteens
i
have
many
more
to
tell
but
can
show
you
all
the
long
story
i
have
written
i
hope
it
does
not
seem
very
stale
and
all
being
new
and
curious
to
the
eye
here
one
becomes
about
mere
trifles
one
small
thing
more
the
first
few
shillings
that
a
coloured
woman
has
to
spend
on
her
cottage
go
do
you
think
grand
toilet
table
of
worked
muslin
over
pink
all
set
out
with
little
as
they
are
if
there
is
nothing
else
there
is
that
here
as
at
capetown
and
all
along
to
bay
now
what
is
the
use
or
comfort
of
a
to
a
hottentot
family
i
shall
never
see
those
toilets
again
without
thinking
of
a
baroque
association
of
ideas
i
intend
in
a
day
or
two
to
go
over
to
the
moravian
missionary
station
founded
in
gemeinde
von
how
little
did
i
think
to
see
it
when
we
smiled
at
the
phrase
in
old
sermon
years
ago
in
london
the
hottentots
are
not
as
it
is
said
thought
well
even
tipsier
than
the
rest
but
i
may
see
a
one
and
even
a
true
bosjesman
which
is
worth
a
couple
of
drive
and
the
place
is
said
to
be
beautiful
this
climate
is
evidently
a
styptic
of
great
power
i
shall
write
a
few
lines
to
the
about
caledon
and
its
hot
as
the
germans
at
houw
hoek
call
it
the
baths
do
not
concern
me
as
they
are
chalybeate
but
they
seem
very
effectual
in
many
cases
yet
english
people
never
come
here
they
stay
at
capetown
which
must
be
a
furnace
now
or
at
wynberg
which
is
damp
and
chill
comparatively
at
most
they
get
to
stellenbosch
i
mean
visitors
not
settlers
are
everywhere
i
look
the
colour
of
a
hottentot
now
i
leave
off
your
most
affectionate
letter
vii
gnadenthal
caledon
well
i
have
been
to
gnadenthal
and
seen
the
and
a
lovely
spot
it
is
a
large
village
nestled
in
a
deep
valley
surrounded
by
high
mountains
on
three
sides
and
a
lower
range
in
front
we
started
early
on
saturday
and
drove
over
a
mighty
queer
road
and
through
a
river
oh
ye
gods
what
a
shaking
and
pounding
we
were
rattled
up
like
dice
in
a
box
nothing
but
a
cape
cart
cape
horses
and
a
hottentot
driver
above
all
could
have
accomplished
it
captain
rode
and
had
the
best
of
it
on
the
road
we
passed
three
or
four
farms
at
all
which
horses
were
the
grain
or
men
were
winnowing
it
by
tossing
it
up
with
wooden
shovels
to
let
the
wind
blow
away
the
chaff
we
did
the
miles
up
and
down
the
mountain
roads
in
two
hours
and
a
half
with
our
valiant
little
pair
of
horses
it
is
incredible
how
they
go
we
stopped
at
a
nice
cottage
on
the
hillside
belonging
to
a
slave
one
christian
rietz
a
man
with
brown
woolly
hair
sharp
features
grey
eyes
and
woolly
moustaches
he
said
he
was
a
and
bon
sang
for
a
more
thriving
shrewd
sensible
fellow
i
never
saw
his
and
master
had
had
to
let
him
go
when
all
slaves
were
emancipated
and
he
had
come
to
gnadenthal
he
keeps
a
little
inn
in
the
village
and
a
shop
and
a
fine
garden
the
cottage
we
lodged
in
was
on
the
mountain
side
and
had
been
built
for
his
son
who
was
dead
and
his
adopted
daughter
a
pretty
coloured
girl
exactly
like
a
southern
frenchwoman
waited
on
us
assisted
by
about
six
or
seven
other
women
who
came
chiefly
to
stare
vrouw
rietz
was
as
black
as
a
coal
but
pretty
dear
soft
sleek
old
lady
with
beautiful
eyes
and
the
kind
pleasant
ways
which
belong
to
nice
blacks
and
though
old
and
fat
still
graceful
and
lovely
in
face
hands
and
arms
the
cottage
was
thus
large
hall
my
bedroom
on
the
right
on
the
left
the
kitchen
behind
me
miss
rietz
behind
mud
floors
daintily
washed
over
with
fresh
ceiling
of
big
rafters
just
as
they
had
grown
on
which
rested
bamboo
canes
close
together
the
rafters
and
bound
together
between
each
with
transverse
pretty
effect
at
top
mud
again
and
then
a
high
thatched
roof
and
a
loft
or
zolder
for
forage
the
walls
of
course
mud
very
thick
and
whitewashed
the
bedrooms
tiny
beds
clean
sweet
melies
maize
straw
with
clean
sheets
and
eight
good
pillows
on
each
glass
windows
a
great
distinction
exquisite
cleanliness
and
hearty
civility
good
food
well
cooked
horrid
tea
and
coffee
and
hardly
any
milk
no
end
of
fruit
in
all
the
gardens
it
hung
on
the
trees
thicker
than
the
leaves
never
did
i
behold
such
a
profusion
of
fruit
and
vegetables
but
first
i
must
tell
what
struck
me
most
i
asked
one
of
the
herrenhut
brethren
whether
there
were
any
hottentots
and
he
said
one
and
next
morning
as
i
sat
waiting
for
early
prayers
under
the
big
in
the
plaats
square
he
came
up
followed
by
a
tiny
old
man
hobbling
along
with
a
long
stick
to
support
him
said
he
the
hottentot
he
is
a
hundred
and
seven
years
old
and
lives
all
i
looked
on
the
little
wizened
yellow
face
and
was
shocked
that
he
should
be
dragged
up
like
a
wild
beast
to
be
stared
at
a
feeling
of
pity
which
felt
like
remorse
fell
upon
me
and
my
eyes
filled
as
i
rose
and
stood
before
him
so
tall
and
like
a
tyrant
and
oppressor
while
he
uncovered
his
poor
little
old
head
and
peered
up
in
my
face
i
led
him
to
the
seat
and
helped
him
to
sit
down
and
said
in
dutch
i
hope
you
are
not
tired
you
are
he
saw
and
heard
as
well
as
ever
and
spoke
good
dutch
in
a
firm
voice
i
am
above
a
hundred
years
old
and
i
sat
beside
him
and
he
put
his
head
on
one
side
and
looked
curiously
up
at
me
with
his
faded
but
still
piercing
little
wild
eyes
perhaps
he
had
a
perception
of
what
i
i
hardly
think
so
perhaps
he
thought
i
was
in
trouble
for
he
crept
close
up
to
me
and
put
one
tiny
brown
paw
into
my
hand
which
he
stroked
with
the
other
and
asked
like
most
coloured
people
if
i
had
children
i
said
at
home
in
england
and
he
patted
my
hand
again
and
said
bless
them
it
was
a
relief
to
feel
that
he
was
pleased
for
i
should
have
felt
like
a
murderer
if
my
curiosity
had
added
a
pain
to
so
tragic
a
fate
this
may
sound
like
sentimentalism
but
you
can
not
conceive
the
effect
of
looking
on
the
last
of
a
race
once
the
owners
of
all
this
land
and
now
utterly
gone
his
look
was
not
quite
human
physically
speaking
good
head
small
eyes
piercing
and
restless
strangely
high
and
prominent
nose
flat
mouth
rather
wide
thin
shapeless
lips
and
an
indescribably
small
long
pointed
chin
with
just
a
very
little
soft
white
woolly
beard
his
head
covered
with
extremely
short
close
white
wool
which
ended
round
the
poll
in
little
ringlets
hands
and
feet
like
an
english
child
of
seven
or
eight
and
person
about
the
size
of
a
child
of
eleven
he
had
all
his
teeth
and
though
shrunk
to
nothing
was
very
little
wrinkled
in
the
face
and
not
at
all
in
the
hands
which
were
dark
brown
while
his
face
was
yellow
his
manner
and
way
of
speaking
were
like
those
of
an
old
peasant
in
england
only
his
voice
was
clearer
and
stronger
and
his
perceptions
not
blunted
by
age
he
had
travelled
with
one
of
the
missionaries
in
the
year
or
thereabouts
and
remained
with
them
ever
since
i
went
into
the
large
clean
rather
handsome
building
consecrated
in
heard
a
very
good
sort
of
litany
mixed
with
such
singing
as
only
black
voices
can
produce
the
organ
was
beautifully
played
by
a
bastaard
lad
the
herrenhuters
use
very
fine
chants
and
the
perfect
ear
and
heavenly
voices
of
a
large
congregation
about
six
hundred
all
coloured
people
made
music
more
beautiful
than
any
i
ever
heard
prayers
lasted
half
an
hour
then
the
congregation
turned
out
of
doors
and
the
windows
were
opened
some
of
the
people
went
away
and
others
waited
for
the
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
a
much
larger
congregation
than
the
first
assembled
the
girls
all
with
tied
round
their
heads
so
as
to
look
exactly
like
the
ancient
greek
with
a
double
very
prettiest
and
neatest
coiffure
i
ever
saw
the
gowns
were
made
like
those
of
english
girls
of
the
same
class
but
far
smarter
cleaner
and
gayer
in
and
green
and
yellow
and
bright
blue
several
were
all
in
white
with
white
gloves
the
men
and
women
sit
separate
and
the
side
was
a
bed
of
tulips
the
young
fellows
were
very
smart
indeed
with
muslin
or
gauze
either
white
pink
or
blue
rolled
round
their
hats
that
is
universal
here
on
account
of
the
sun
the
hottentots
as
they
are
is
those
of
mixed
dutch
and
hottentot
origin
correctly
a
sort
of
blackguard
elegance
in
their
gait
and
figure
which
is
peculiar
to
them
a
mixture
of
negro
or
mozambique
blood
alters
it
altogether
the
girls
have
the
elegance
without
the
blackguard
look
are
slender
most
are
tall
all
graceful
all
have
good
hands
and
feet
some
few
are
handsome
in
the
face
and
many
very
the
complexion
is
a
pale
and
the
hair
more
or
less
woolly
face
flat
and
cheekbones
high
eyes
small
and
bright
these
are
by
far
the
most
indeed
to
whites
a
mixture
of
black
blood
often
gives
real
beauty
but
takes
off
from
the
and
generally
from
the
talent
but
then
the
blacks
are
so
pleasant
and
the
hottentots
are
taciturn
and
reserved
the
old
women
of
this
breed
are
the
grandest
hags
i
ever
saw
they
are
clean
and
well
dressed
and
tie
up
their
old
faces
in
white
handkerchiefs
like
corpses
like
those
of
andrea
del
old
women
they
are
splendid
also
they
are
very
clean
people
addicted
to
tubbing
more
than
any
others
the
who
lounges
about
your
breakfast
table
in
rags
and
dishevelled
hair
has
been
in
the
river
before
you
were
awake
or
if
that
was
too
far
off
in
a
tub
they
are
also
far
cleaner
in
their
huts
than
any
but
the
english
poor
the
was
delivered
after
more
singing
by
a
missionary
in
dutch
very
ranting
and
not
very
wise
the
congregation
was
singularly
decorous
and
attentive
but
did
not
seem
at
all
excited
or
like
a
audience
only
rather
more
attentive
the
service
lasted
of
an
hour
including
a
short
prayer
and
two
hymns
the
people
came
out
and
filed
off
in
total
silence
and
very
quickly
the
tall
graceful
girls
draping
their
gay
silk
shawls
beautifully
there
are
seven
missionaries
all
in
orders
but
one
the
blacksmith
and
all
married
except
the
resident
director
of
the
there
is
a
doctor
a
carpenter
a
a
and
a
very
agreeable
man
who
had
been
missionary
in
greenland
and
labrador
and
interpreter
to
macclure
there
is
one
all
are
germans
and
so
are
their
wives
my
friend
the
storekeeper
married
without
having
ever
beheld
his
wife
before
they
met
at
the
altar
and
came
on
board
ship
at
once
with
her
he
said
it
was
as
good
a
way
of
marrying
as
any
other
and
that
they
were
happy
together
she
was
lying
in
so
i
did
not
see
her
at
eight
years
old
their
children
are
all
sent
home
to
germany
to
be
educated
and
they
seldom
see
them
again
on
each
side
of
the
church
are
schools
and
next
to
them
the
houses
on
one
side
of
the
square
and
on
the
other
a
row
of
workshops
where
the
hottentots
are
taught
all
manner
of
trades
i
have
got
a
couple
of
knives
made
at
gnadenthal
for
the
children
the
girls
occupy
the
school
in
the
morning
and
the
boys
in
the
afternoon
half
a
day
is
found
quite
enough
of
lessons
in
this
climate
the
infant
school
was
of
both
sexes
but
a
different
set
morning
and
afternoon
the
children
were
in
the
infant
school
and
behind
the
little
blonde
german
three
jet
black
niggerlings
rolled
over
each
other
like
and
grinned
and
care
a
straw
for
the
spelling
while
the
dingy
yellow
little
bastaards
were
straining
their
black
eyes
out
with
eagerness
to
answer
the
questions
he
and
the
mistress
were
both
bastaards
and
he
seemed
an
excellent
teacher
the
girls
were
learning
writing
from
a
master
and
bible
history
from
a
mistress
also
people
of
colour
and
the
stupid
set
mostly
black
were
having
spelling
hammered
into
their
thick
skulls
by
another
yellow
mistress
in
another
room
at
the
boarding
school
were
twenty
lads
from
thirteen
up
to
twenty
in
training
for
at
different
stations
gnadenthal
supplies
the
church
of
england
with
them
as
well
as
their
own
stations
there
were
caffres
fingoes
a
mantatee
one
boy
evidently
of
some
oriental
blood
with
glossy
smooth
hair
and
a
copper
the
rest
bastaards
of
various
hues
some
mixed
with
black
probably
mozambique
the
caffre
lads
were
splendid
young
they
had
just
printed
the
first
book
in
the
caffre
language
got
it
for
hawtrey
from
the
new
testament
i
made
them
read
the
sheets
they
were
going
to
bind
it
is
a
beautiful
language
like
spanish
in
tone
only
with
a
queer
in
it
the
boys
drew
like
chinese
from
and
wrote
like
they
sang
some
of
choruses
from
splendidly
the
caffres
rolling
out
soft
rich
bass
voices
like
melodious
thunder
they
are
clever
at
handicrafts
and
fond
of
geography
and
natural
history
incapable
of
mathematics
quick
at
languages
utterly
incurious
about
other
nations
and
would
all
rather
work
in
the
fields
than
learn
anything
but
music
good
boys
honest
but
so
much
for
caffres
fingoes
the
bastaards
are
as
clever
as
whites
and
more
the
told
me
the
boy
who
played
the
organ
sang
the
like
an
angel
and
played
us
a
number
of
waltzes
and
other
things
on
the
piano
but
he
was
too
shy
to
talk
while
the
caffres
crowded
round
me
and
chattered
away
merrily
the
mantatees
whom
i
can
not
distinguish
from
caffres
are
scattered
all
over
the
colony
and
rival
the
english
as
workmen
and
stalwart
industrious
fellows
our
little
kleenboy
hires
a
room
for
fifteen
shillings
a
month
and
takes
in
his
compatriots
as
lodgers
at
half
a
crown
a
usurious
little
rogue
his
chief
one
james
is
a
bricklayer
here
and
looks
and
behaves
like
a
prince
it
is
fine
to
see
his
black
arms
ornamented
with
silver
bracelets
hurling
huge
stones
about
all
gnadenthal
is
wonderfully
fruitful
being
well
watered
but
it
is
not
healthy
for
whites
i
imagine
too
hot
and
damp
there
are
three
or
four
thousand
coloured
people
there
under
the
control
of
the
missionaries
who
allow
no
canteens
at
all
the
people
may
have
what
they
please
at
home
but
no
public
is
allowed
and
we
had
to
take
our
own
beer
and
wine
for
the
three
days
the
gardens
and
are
beautiful
and
the
square
is
entirely
shaded
by
about
ten
or
twelve
superb
oaks
nothing
prettier
can
be
conceived
it
is
not
popular
in
the
neighbourhood
see
it
makes
the
niggers
to
have
homes
of
their
the
girls
are
said
to
be
immoral
as
to
that
there
are
no
among
the
coloured
people
and
how
or
why
should
there
it
is
an
honour
to
one
of
these
girls
to
have
a
child
by
a
white
man
and
it
is
a
degradation
to
him
to
marry
a
dark
girl
a
pious
stiff
old
dutchwoman
who
came
here
the
other
day
for
the
sacrament
which
takes
place
twice
a
year
had
one
girl
with
her
big
with
child
by
her
son
who
also
came
for
the
sacrament
and
two
in
the
straw
at
home
by
the
other
son
this
caused
her
exactly
as
much
emotion
as
i
feel
when
my
cat
kittens
no
one
takes
any
notice
either
to
blame
or
to
nurse
the
poor
scramble
through
it
as
pussy
does
the
english
are
almost
equally
contemptuous
but
there
is
one
great
difference
my
host
for
instance
always
calls
a
black
but
if
that
nigger
is
wronged
or
oppressed
he
fights
for
him
or
bails
him
out
of
the
tronk
and
an
english
jury
gives
a
just
verdict
while
a
dutch
one
simply
finds
for
a
dutchman
against
any
one
else
and
against
a
dark
man
i
believe
this
to
be
true
from
what
i
have
seen
and
heard
and
certainly
the
coloured
people
have
a
great
preference
for
the
english
i
am
persecuted
by
the
ugliest
and
blackest
mozambiquer
i
have
yet
seen
a
labourer
who
can
speak
english
and
says
he
was
servant
to
an
english
a
good
fellow
he
was
only
dead
he
now
insists
on
my
taking
him
as
a
servant
dessay
your
man
at
home
is
a
good
chap
and
be
a
good
boy
and
cook
very
he
is
and
short
and
strong
nature
has
adorned
him
with
a
cock
eye
and
a
yard
of
mouth
and
art
with
a
prodigiously
tall
white
hat
with
the
crown
out
a
cotton
nightcap
and
a
wondrous
congeries
of
rags
he
professes
to
be
cook
groom
and
and
is
sure
you
would
be
pleased
with
his
attentions
well
to
go
back
to
gnadenthal
i
wandered
all
over
the
village
on
sunday
afternoon
and
peeped
into
the
cottages
all
were
neat
and
clean
with
good
dressers
of
crockery
the
poorest
like
the
worst
in
weybridge
sandpits
but
they
had
no
glass
windows
only
a
wooden
shutter
and
no
doors
a
calico
curtain
or
a
sort
of
hurdle
supplying
its
place
the
people
nodded
and
said
day
but
took
no
further
notice
of
me
except
the
poor
old
hottentot
who
was
seated
on
a
doorstep
he
rose
and
hobbled
up
to
meet
me
and
take
my
hand
again
he
seemed
to
enjoy
being
helped
along
and
seated
down
carefully
and
shook
and
patted
my
hand
repeatedly
when
i
took
leave
of
him
at
this
the
people
stared
a
good
deal
and
one
woman
came
to
talk
to
me
in
the
evening
i
sat
on
a
bench
in
the
square
and
saw
the
people
go
in
to
the
church
was
lighted
and
as
i
sat
there
and
heard
the
lovely
singing
i
thought
it
was
impossible
to
conceive
a
more
romantic
scene
on
monday
i
saw
all
the
schools
and
then
looked
at
the
great
strong
caffre
lads
playing
in
the
square
one
of
them
stood
to
be
pelted
by
five
or
six
others
and
as
the
stones
came
he
twisted
and
turned
and
jumped
and
was
hardly
ever
hit
and
when
he
was
he
care
though
the
others
hurled
like
catapults
it
was
the
most
wonderful
display
of
activity
and
grace
and
quite
incredible
that
such
a
huge
fellow
should
be
so
quick
and
light
when
i
found
how
comfortable
dear
old
rietz
made
me
i
was
sorry
i
had
hired
the
cart
and
kept
it
to
take
me
home
for
i
would
gladly
have
stayed
longer
and
the
heat
did
me
no
harm
but
i
did
not
like
to
throw
away
a
pound
or
two
and
drove
back
that
evening
rietz
told
me
her
mother
was
a
mozambiquer
your
father
said
i
i
know
mother
was
only
a
she
too
was
a
slave
but
said
she
knew
her
was
so
good
a
dutch
lady
at
a
farm
i
had
passed
on
the
road
who
had
a
hundred
and
fifty
slaves
i
liked
my
hottentot
hut
amazingly
and
the
sweet
brown
bread
and
the
dinner
cooked
so
cleanly
on
the
bricks
in
the
kitchen
the
walls
were
whitewashed
and
adorned
with
wreaths
of
everlasting
flowers
and
some
quaint
old
prints
from
subjects
not
exactly
edifying
well
i
have
prosed
unconscionably
so
adieu
for
the
present
happy
returns
of
your
birthday
dear
i
had
a
bottle
of
champagne
to
drink
your
health
and
partly
to
swell
the
bill
which
these
good
people
make
so
moderate
that
i
am
half
ashamed
i
get
everything
that
caledon
can
furnish
for
myself
and
for
a
month
on
saturday
we
got
the
sad
news
of
prince
death
and
it
created
real
consternation
here
what
a
thoroughly
unexpected
calamity
every
one
is
already
dressed
in
deep
mourning
it
is
more
general
than
in
a
village
of
the
same
size
at
how
i
have
caught
the
colonial
trick
of
always
saying
for
england
dutchmen
who
can
barely
speak
english
and
never
did
or
will
see
england
equally
talk
of
from
it
also
seems
by
the
papers
of
the
of
december
which
came
by
a
steamer
the
other
day
that
war
is
imminent
i
shall
have
to
wait
for
convoy
i
suppose
as
i
object
to
walking
the
plank
from
a
yankee
privateer
i
shall
wait
here
for
the
next
mail
and
then
go
back
to
capetown
stopping
by
the
way
so
as
to
get
there
early
in
march
and
arrange
for
my
voyage
the
weather
had
a
relapse
into
cold
and
an
attempt
at
rain
pity
it
failed
for
the
drought
is
dreadful
this
year
chiefly
owing
to
the
unusual
quantity
of
sharp
drying
most
unlucky
summer
for
the
country
and
for
me
my
old
friend
klein
who
told
me
several
instances
of
the
kindness
and
gratitude
of
former
slaves
poured
out
to
me
the
misery
he
had
undergone
from
the
of
a
certain
rosina
a
of
his
she
was
in
her
youth
handsome
clever
the
best
horsebreaker
and
driver
and
hardest
worker
in
the
district
she
had
two
children
by
klein
then
a
young
fellow
six
by
another
white
man
and
a
few
more
by
two
husbands
of
her
own
race
but
she
was
of
a
rebellious
spirit
and
took
to
drink
after
the
emancipation
she
used
to
go
in
front
of
windows
and
read
the
statute
in
a
loud
voice
on
every
anniversary
of
the
day
and
as
if
that
did
not
enrage
him
enough
she
pertinaciously
whenever
she
was
a
little
drunk
kissed
him
by
main
force
every
time
she
met
him
in
the
street
exclaiming
when
i
young
and
pretty
you
make
kiss
me
then
now
i
ugly
drunk
dirty
old
devil
and
free
woman
i
kiss
you
frightful
retributive
justice
i
struggled
hard
to
keep
my
countenance
but
the
fat
old
rueful
face
was
too
much
for
me
his
tormentor
is
dead
but
he
retains
a
painful
impression
of
her
our
little
mantatee
has
again
like
jeshurun
fat
and
as
soon
as
he
had
eaten
enough
to
be
once
more
plump
and
shiny
after
his
hungry
period
he
took
to
squatting
on
the
stoep
just
in
front
of
the
and
altogether
declining
to
do
anything
so
he
is
superseded
by
an
equally
ugly
little
englishman
the
irish
housemaid
has
married
the
german
baker
a
fine
match
for
her
and
a
dour
little
scotch
presbyterian
has
come
up
from
capetown
in
her
place
such
are
the
vicissitudes
of
colonial
the
only
is
the
old
soldier
of
captain
regiment
who
is
barman
in
the
canteen
and
not
likely
to
leave
and
the
coloured
girl
who
improves
on
acquaintance
she
wants
to
ingratiate
herself
with
me
and
get
taken
to
england
her
father
is
an
englishman
and
of
course
the
brown
mother
and
her
large
family
always
live
in
the
fear
of
his
and
ignoring
their
existence
a
with
the
mother
of
his
children
would
be
too
much
degradation
for
him
to
submit
to
few
of
the
coloured
people
are
ever
married
but
they
separate
oftener
than
married
folks
bill
the
handsome
west
indian
black
married
my
pretty
washerwoman
rosalind
and
was
thought
rather
assuming
because
he
was
asked
in
church
and
lawfully
married
and
she
wore
a
handsome
lilac
silk
gown
and
a
white
wreath
and
veil
and
very
well
she
looked
in
them
she
had
a
child
of
two
years
old
which
did
not
at
all
disconcert
bill
but
he
continues
to
be
dignified
and
let
her
go
and
wash
clothes
in
the
river
because
the
hot
sun
makes
her
ill
and
it
is
not
fit
work
for
women
night
a
dance
took
place
in
a
house
next
door
to
this
and
a
party
of
boers
attempted
to
go
in
but
were
repulsed
by
a
sortie
of
the
young
men
within
some
of
the
more
peaceable
boers
came
in
here
and
wanted
ale
which
was
refused
as
they
were
already
very
so
they
imbibed
whereof
one
drank
bottles
to
his
own
share
inspired
by
this
drink
they
began
to
quarrel
and
were
summarily
turned
out
they
spent
the
whole
night
till
five
this
morning
scuffling
and
vociferating
in
the
street
the
constables
discreetly
stayed
in
bed
displaying
the
true
dogberry
spirit
which
leads
them
to
take
up
hottentots
drunk
or
sober
to
show
their
zeal
but
carefully
to
avoid
meddling
with
stalwart
boers
from
six
to
six
and
a
half
feet
high
and
strong
in
proportion
the
jabbering
of
dutch
brings
to
mind
demosthenes
trying
to
outroar
a
stormy
sea
with
his
mouth
full
of
pebbles
the
hardest
blows
are
those
given
with
the
tongue
though
much
pulling
of
hair
and
scuffling
takes
place
schmeerlap
and
bliksem
am
i
a
verdomde
schmeerlap
u
is
i
could
not
help
laughing
heartily
as
i
lay
in
bed
at
hearing
the
gambols
of
these
titan
cubs
for
this
is
a
notion
of
enjoying
himself
this
morning
i
hear
the
street
was
strewn
with
the
hair
they
had
pulled
out
of
each
heads
all
who
come
here
make
love
to
not
by
describing
their
tender
feelings
but
by
enumerating
the
oxen
sheep
horses
land
money
of
which
they
are
possessed
and
whereof
by
the
law
of
this
colony
she
would
become
on
marriage
there
is
a
fine
handsome
van
steen
who
is
very
persevering
but
does
not
seem
to
fancy
becoming
mevrouw
at
all
the
demand
for
english
girls
as
wives
is
wonderful
here
the
nasty
cross
little
ugly
scotch
maid
has
had
three
offers
already
in
one
fortnight
expect
to
receive
the
letters
by
the
english
mail
morning
and
to
go
to
worcester
on
thursday
on
saturday
the
young
jolly
big
young
me
with
his
pretty
little
greys
over
to
two
farms
at
one
i
ate
half
a
huge
melon
and
at
the
other
uncounted
grapes
we
poor
europeans
know
what
fruit
i
must
admit
the
melon
was
a
foretaste
of
paradise
and
the
grapes
made
fingers
as
sticky
as
honey
and
had
a
muscat
fragrance
quite
inconceivable
they
looked
like
amber
eggs
the
best
of
it
is
too
that
in
this
climate
are
not
we
all
eat
grapes
peaches
and
figs
all
day
long
old
klein
sends
me
for
my
own
daily
consumption
about
thirty
peaches
three
pounds
of
grapes
and
apples
pears
and
figs
a
little
taste
of
only
here
they
will
pick
it
all
unripe
post
came
in
late
last
night
and
old
klein
kindly
sent
me
my
letters
at
near
midnight
the
post
goes
out
this
evening
and
the
hot
wind
is
blowing
so
i
can
only
write
to
you
and
a
line
to
my
mother
i
feel
really
better
now
i
think
the
constant
eating
of
grapes
has
done
me
much
good
the
dutch
was
so
extortionate
that
i
am
going
to
wait
a
few
days
and
write
to
my
dear
malay
to
come
up
and
drive
me
back
it
is
better
than
having
to
fight
the
dutch
monopolist
in
every
village
and
getting
drunken
drivers
and
bad
carts
after
all
i
shall
go
round
all
the
same
the
weather
has
been
beautiful
there
is
a
wind
which
comes
about
two
or
three
times
in
the
year
it
is
not
depressing
but
hot
and
a
bore
because
one
must
shut
every
window
or
be
stifled
with
dust
the
people
are
burning
the
veld
all
about
and
the
lurid
smoke
by
day
and
flaming
by
night
are
very
striking
the
ashes
of
the
bosh
serve
as
manure
for
the
young
grass
which
will
sprout
in
the
autumn
rains
such
nights
such
a
moon
i
walk
out
after
dark
when
it
is
mild
and
clear
and
can
read
any
print
by
the
moonlight
and
see
the
distant
landscape
as
well
as
by
day
old
klein
has
just
sent
me
a
haunch
of
bok
and
the
skin
and
hoofs
which
are
pretty
letter
viii
caledon
sunday
you
must
have
fallen
into
second
childhood
to
think
of
such
rambling
hasty
scrawls
as
i
write
i
never
could
write
a
good
letter
and
unless
i
gallop
as
hard
as
i
can
and
stop
to
think
i
can
say
nothing
so
all
is
confused
and
unconnected
only
i
fancy
will
be
amused
by
some
of
my
i
have
written
to
my
mother
an
accurate
account
of
my
health
i
am
dressed
and
out
of
doors
never
later
than
six
now
the
weather
makes
it
possible
it
is
surprising
how
little
sleep
one
wants
i
go
to
bed
at
ten
and
often
am
up
at
four
i
made
friends
here
the
other
day
with
a
lively
little
old
irishman
who
came
out
at
seven
years
old
a
he
has
made
a
fortune
by
on
as
thus
he
charters
two
waggons
twelve
oxen
each
and
two
hottentots
to
each
waggon
leader
and
driver
the
waggons
he
fills
with
cotton
hardware
ambulatory
village
goes
about
fifteen
miles
a
day
on
and
on
into
the
far
interior
swapping
baftas
calico
punjums
loose
trowsers
and
voerschitz
cotton
gownpieces
pronounced
against
oxen
and
sheep
when
all
is
gone
he
swaps
his
waggons
against
more
oxen
and
a
horse
and
he
and
his
four
drive
home
the
spoil
and
he
has
doubled
or
trebled
his
venture
home
each
day
they
kill
a
sheep
and
eat
it
says
i
whole
bit
i
always
take
one
leg
and
the
liver
for
myself
and
the
totties
roast
the
rest
and
melt
all
the
fat
and
entrails
down
in
an
iron
pot
and
eat
it
with
a
wooden
revenais
the
whole
leg
and
liver
at
one
meal
bit
ay
and
do
the
same
if
you
were
no
bread
no
salt
no
and
water
the
old
fellow
was
quite
poetic
and
heroic
in
describing
the
joys
and
perils
of
togt
i
said
i
should
like
to
go
too
and
he
bewailed
having
settled
a
year
ago
in
a
store
at
swellendam
fitted
up
a
waggon
all
nice
and
snug
for
me
and
shown
me
what
going
on
togt
was
like
nothing
like
it
for
the
health
and
beautiful
my
friend
had
in
gold
in
a
carpet
bag
without
a
lock
lying
about
on
the
stoep
right
nobody
steals
money
or
such
like
here
going
to
pay
bills
in
tell
my
mother
that
a
man
would
get
from
to
a
month
wages
with
board
lodging
all
found
and
his
wife
from
to
a
month
and
everything
found
according
to
abilities
and
testimonials
wages
are
enormous
and
servants
at
famine
price
emigrant
ships
are
in
three
days
and
every
ragged
irish
girl
in
place
somewhere
four
pounds
a
month
and
food
for
self
husband
and
children
is
no
uncommon
pay
for
a
good
cook
and
after
all
her
cookery
may
be
poor
enough
my
landlady
at
capetown
gave
that
the
housemaid
had
a
month
but
told
me
herself
she
had
taken
in
one
week
in
she
was
an
excellent
servant
up
country
here
the
wages
are
less
but
the
comfort
greater
and
the
chances
of
much
increased
but
i
believe
algoa
bay
or
grahamstown
are
by
far
the
best
fields
for
new
colonists
and
i
am
assured
the
best
climate
for
lung
diseases
the
wealthy
english
merchants
of
port
elizabeth
algoa
bay
pay
best
it
seems
to
me
as
far
as
i
can
learn
that
every
really
man
or
woman
can
thrive
here
my
german
host
at
houw
hoek
came
out
years
ago
he
told
me
without
a
and
is
now
the
owner
of
cattle
and
land
and
horses
to
a
large
amount
but
then
the
germans
work
while
the
dutch
dawdle
and
the
english
drink
is
a
penny
a
glass
half
a
pint
enough
to
blow
your
head
off
and
brandy
like
vitriol
ninepence
a
is
the
real
calamity
if
the
cape
had
the
grape
disease
as
badly
as
madeira
it
would
be
the
making
of
the

i
received
a
message
from
my
malay
friends
abdool
jemaalee
and
betsy
anxious
to
know
the
misses
had
good
news
of
her
children
for
bad
news
would
make
her
old
betsy
and
i
used
to
prose
about
young
abdurrachman
and
his
studies
at
mecca
and
about
my
children
with
more
real
heartiness
than
you
can
fancy
we
were
not
afraid
of
boring
each
other
and
pious

sat

nodded

letter

this
post
brought
your
packet
and
the
announcement
of
an
extra
mail
i
can
send
you
a
i
hear
that
capetown
has
been
pestilential
and
as
hot
as
calcutta
it
is
totally
undrained
and
the
mozambiquers
are
beginning
to
object
to
acting
as
scavengers
to
each
separate
house
the
are
more
barbarous
even
than
in
paris
without
the
or
they
must
have
fevers
and
though
too
rough
a
practitioner
for
me
he
benefits
the
general
health
next
month
the
winds
abate
but
last
week
an
omnibus
was
blown
over
on
the
rondebosch
road
which
is
the
most
sheltered
spot
and
inhabited
by
capetown
merchants
i
have
received
all
the
quite
safe
likewise
the
books
letters
and
the
novel
i
have
written
for
my
dear
choslullah
to
fetch
me
the
dutch
farmers
know
how
to
charge
enough
moreover
the
hottentot
drivers
get
drunk
and
for
two
lone
women
that
is
not
the
thing
i
pay
my
gentle
malay
thirty
shillings
a
day
which
for
a
cart
and
four
and
such
a
jewel
of
a
driver
is
not
outrageous
and
i
had
better
pay
that
for
the
few
days
i
wait
on
the
road
than
risk
bad
carts
tipsy
hottentots
and
extortionate
boers
this
intermediate
country
between
the
african
and
capetown
has
been
little
frequented
i
went
to
the
church
mission
school
with
the
english
clergyman
yesterday
you
know
i
believe
in
every
kind
of
missionaries
but
i
do
believe
that
in
these
districts
kind
judicious
english
clergymen
are
of
great
value
the
dutch
pastors
still
remember
the
distinction
between
and
but
the
church
mission
schools
teach
the
anglican
catechism
to
every
child
that
will
learn
and
the
congregation
is
as
piebald
as
jacket
a
pretty
coloured
lad
about
eleven
years
old
answered
my
questions
in
geography
with
great
quickness
and
some
wit
i
said
me
the
country
you
belong
he
pointed
to
england
and
when
i
laughed
to
the
cape
is
where
we
are
but
that
is
the
country
i
i
asked
him
how
we
were
governed
and
he
answered
quite
right
is
the
cape
governed
we
have
a
parliament
too
and
silberbauer
is
the
man
boys
and
girls
of
all
ages
were
mixed
but
no
blacks
i
think
they
will
learn
except
on
compulsion
as
at
gnadenthal
i
regret
to
say
that
wife
has
broken
his
head
with
a
bottle
at
the
end
of
the
honeymoon
i
fear
the
innovation
of
being
at
has
not
had
a
good
effect
and
that
his
neighbours
may
quote
peachum
i
was
offered
a
young
lion
yesterday
but
i
hardly
think
it
would
be
an
agreeable
addition
to
the
household
at
esher
i
hear
that
worcester
paarl
and
stellenbosch
are
beautiful
and
the
road
very
desolate
and
grand
one
mountain
pass
takes
six
hours
to
cross
i
should
not
return
to
capetown
so
early
but
poor
captain
has
had
his
leg
smashed
and
amputated
so
i
must
look
out
for
myself
in
the
matter
of
ships
whenever
it
is
hot
i
am
well
for
the
heat
here
is
so
and
dry
the
wind
tries
me
but
we
have
little
here
compared
to
the
coast
i
hope
that
the
voyage
home
will
do
me
still
more
good
but
i
will
not
sail
till
april
so
as
to
arrive
in
june
may
in
the
channel
would
not
do
how
i
wish
i
could
send
you
the
fruit
now
on
my
grapes
yellow
waxen
apples
streaked
with
vermillion
in
fine
little
lines
huge
peaches
and
tiny
green
figs
i
must
send
dear
old
klein
a
little
present
from
england
to
show
that
i
forget
my
dutch
adorer
i
wish
i
could
bring
you
the
he
sent
or
bok
dried
in
the
sun
in
strips
and
slightly
salted
you
may
carry
enough
in
your
pocket
to
live
on
for
a
fortnight
and
it
is
very
good
as
a
little
the
partridges
also
have
been
welcome
and
we
shall
eat
the
tiny
haunch
of
bok
is
gone
to
capetown
to
get
servants
the
scotch
girl
having
carried
on
her
amours
too
flagrantly
and
will
return
in
my
cart
is
still
keeping
house
meanwhile
much
perturbed
by
the
placid
indolence
of
the
brown
girl
the
stableman
cooks
and
very
well
too
this
is
colonial
series
of
makeshifts
and
difficulties
but
the
climate
is
fine
people
feel
well
and
make
money
and
i
think
it
is
not
an
unhappy
life
i
have
been
most
fortunate
in
my
abode
and
can
say
without
speaking
cynically
that
i
have
found
warmest
welcome
at
an
mine
host
is
a
rough
soldier
but
the
very
soul
of
good
nature
and
good
feeling
and
his
wife
is
a
very
nice
cheerful
clever
and
kindhearted
i
should
like
to
bring
home
the
little
madagascar
girl
from
rathfelders
or
a
dear
little
mulatto
who
nurses
a
brown
baby
here
and
is
so
clean
and
careful
and
it
would
be
a
great
risk
the
brown
babies
are
fat
and
jolly
and
funny
one
great
charm
of
the
people
here
is
that
no
one
expects
money
or
gifts
and
that
all
civility
is
gratis
many
a
time
i
finger
small
coin
secretly
in
my
pocket
and
refrain
from
giving
it
for
fear
of
spoiling
this
innocence
i
have
not
once
seen
a
implying
and
begging
is
unknown
but
the
people
are
reserved
and
silent
and
have
not
the
attractive
manners
of
the
darkies
of
capetown
and
the
neighbourhood
letter
x
caledon
yesterday
captain
gave
me
a
very
nice
caross
of
blessbok
skins
which
he
got
from
some
travelling
trader
the
excellence
of
the
caffre
and
sewing
is
i
fancy
unequalled
the
are
as
soft
as
a
kid
glove
and
have
no
smell
at
all
in
the
afternoon
the
young
doctor
drove
me
in
his
little
and
pair
the
lightest
and
swiftest
of
conveyances
to
see
a
the
people
were
not
at
work
but
we
saw
the
tubs
and
vats
and
drank
the
grapes
are
simply
trodden
by
a
hottentot
in
a
tub
with
a
sort
of
strainer
at
the
bottom
and
then
stalks
and
vats
where
the
juice
ferments
for
twice
hours
after
which
it
is
run
into
casks
which
are
left
with
the
bung
out
for
eight
days
then
the
wine
is
drawn
off
into
another
cask
a
little
sulphur
and
brandy
are
added
to
it
and
it
is
bunged
down
nothing
can
be
conceived
so
barbarous
i
have
promised
to
procure
and
send
him
an
exact
account
of
the
process
in
spain
it
might
be
a
real
service
to
a
most
worthy
and
amiable
man
also
would
be
glad
of
a
copy
they
literally
know
nothing
about
here
and
with
such
matchless
grapes
i
am
sure
it
ought
to
be
good
altogether
alte
prevails
at
the
cape
to
an
incredible
degree
if
two
call
on
you
please
be
civil
to
them
i
know
them
personally
but
their
brother
is
the
doctor
here
and
the
most
young
fellow
i
ever
saw
if
i
were
returning
by
somerset
instead
of
worcester
i
might
put
up
at
their
house
and
be
sure
of
a
welcome
and
i
can
tell
you
civility
to
strangers
is
by
no
means
of
course
here
i
wonder
at
it
for
the
old
dutch
families
of
the
good
dull
old
school
and
the
english
colonists
can
scarcely
suit
them
in
the
few
instances
in
which
i
have
succeeded
in
a
dutchman
i
have
found
him
wonderfully
and
the
different
manner
in
which
i
was
greeted
when
in
company
with
the
young
doctor
showed
the
feeling
at
once
the
dirt
of
a
dutch
house
is
not
to
be
conceived
i
have
had
sights
in
bedrooms
in
very
respectable
houses
which
i
dare
not
describe
the
coloured
people
are
just
as
clean
the
young
doctor
who
is
much
anglicised
tells
me
that
in
illness
he
has
to
break
the
windows
in
the
are
built
not
to
open
the
boers
are
below
the
english
in
manners
and
intelligence
and
hate
them
for
their
ways
though
seem
slow
enough
to
me
as
to
drink
i
fancy
it
is
six
of
one
and
half
a
dozen
of
the
other
but
the
english
are
more
given
to
eternal
drams
and
the
dutch
to
solemn
drinking
bouts
i
understand
either
in
this
climate
which
is
so
stimulating
that
i
more
often
drink
or
water
than
bottle
of
sherry
lasted
me
a
fortnight
though
i
was
ordered
to
drink
it
somehow
i
had
no
mind
to
it
cart
could
not
be
got
till
the
day
before
yesterday
and
yesterday
arrived
in
it
with
two
new
irish
maids
it
saved
her
and
i
must
have
paid
equally
the
horses
were
very
tired
having
been
hard
at
work
carrying
malays
all
the
week
to
constantia
and
back
on
a
pilgrimage
to
the
tomb
of
a
mussulman
saint
so
they
rest
and
i
go
to
villiersdorp
choslullah
has
been
appointed
driver
of
a
he
tried
hard
to
be
allowed
to
pay
a
and
to
fetch
but
was
refused
leave
and
so
a
smaller
and
blacker
malay
has
come
whom
choslullah
threatened
to
curse
heavily
if
he
failed
to
take
great
care
of
and
be
a
ramadan
begins
on
sunday
and
my
poor
driver
even
prepare
for
it
by
a
good
feast
as
no
fowls
are
to
be
had
here
just
now
and
he
eat
meat
some
pious
christian
has
tried
to
burn
a
mussulman
tomb
at
eerste
river
and
there
were
fears
the
malays
might
indulge
in
a
little
revenge
but
they
keep
quiet
i
am
to
go
with
my
driver
to
eat
some
of
the
feast
of
bairam
is
it
not
at
his
when
ramadan
ends
if
i
am
in
capetown
and
also
am
asked
to
a
wedding
at
a
relation
of
it
was
quite
a
pleasure
to
hear
the
kindly
mussulman
talk
after
these
silent
hottentots
the
malays
have
such
agreeable
manners
so
civil
without
the
least
cringing
or
indian
obsequiousness
i
dare
say
they
can
be
very
on
provocation
but
i
have
always
found
among
them
manners
like
french
ones
but
quieter
and
they
have
an
affectionate
way
of
saying
when
they
know
one
which
is
very
nice
to
hear
it
is
getting
quite
chilly
here
already
night
and
morning
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
descend
off
this
plateau
into
the
warmer
regions
of
worcester
i
have
just
bought
splendid
ostrich
feathers
for
of
my
old
togthandler
friend
in
england
they
would
cost
from
eighteen
to
shillings
each
i
have
got
a
reebok
and
a
klipspringer
skin
for
you
the
latter
makes
a
which
defies
sore
backs
they
were
given
me
by
klein
and
a
farmer
at
palmiet
river
the
flesh
was
poor
stuff
white
and
papery
the
hottentots
the
skins
as
the
caffres
do
and
the
woman
who
did
mine
asked
me
for
a
trifle
beforehand
and
got
so
drunk
that
she
let
them
dry
halfway
in
the
process
consequently
they
look
so
well
worcester
sunday
march
oh
such
a
journey
such
country
pearly
mountains
and
deep
blue
sky
and
an
impassable
pass
to
walk
down
and
baboons
and
secretary
birds
and
tortoises
i
sleep
for
it
all
last
night
tired
as
i
was
with
the
unutterably
bad
road
or
track
rather
well
we
left
caledon
on
friday
at
ten
and
though
the
weather
had
been
cold
and
unpleasant
for
two
days
i
had
a
lovely
morning
and
away
we
went
to
villiersdorp
pronounced
filjeesdorp
it
is
quite
a
tiny
village
in
a
sort
of
valley
we
were
four
hours
on
the
road
winding
along
the
side
of
a
mountain
ridge
which
we
finally
crossed
with
a
splendid
view
of
the
sea
at
the
end
of
a
huge
amphitheatre
formed
by
two
ridges
of
mountains
and
on
the
other
side
the
descent
into
filjeesdorp
the
whole
way
we
saw
no
human
being
or
habitation
except
one
shepherd
from
the
time
we
passed
kraal
about
two
miles
out
of
caledon
the
little
would
not
hold
travellers
so
i
went
to
the
house
of
the
storekeeper
as
the
clergyman
of
caledon
had
told
me
i
might
and
found
a
most
kind
reception
our
host
was
english
an
old
man
with
a
gentle
kindly
dutch
wife
and
the
children
i
have
seen
in
the
colony
they
gave
us
clean
comfortable
beds
and
a
good
dinner
and
wine
ten
years
in
the
cellar
in
short
the
best
of
hospitality
i
made
an
effort
to
pay
for
the
entertainment
next
morning
when
after
a
good
breakfast
we
started
loaded
with
fruit
but
the
kind
people
would
not
hear
of
it
and
bid
me
like
old
friends
at
the
end
of
the
valley
we
went
a
little
and
then
found
ourselves
at
the
top
of
a
pass
down
into
the
level
below
and
i
burst
out
with
one
voice
beautiful
sabaal
our
driver
thought
the
exclamation
was
an
ironical
remark
on
the
road
which
indeed
appeared
to
be
exclusively
intended
for
goats
i
suggested
walking
down
to
which
for
a
wonder
the
malay
agreed
i
was
really
curious
to
see
him
get
down
with
two
wheels
and
four
horses
where
i
had
to
lay
hold
from
time
to
time
in
walking
the
track
was
excessively
steep
barely
wide
enough
and
as
slippery
as
a
flagstone
pavement
being
the
naked
which
is
bare
rock
however
all
went
perfectly
right
how
shall
i
describe
the
view
from
that
pass
in
front
was
a
long
long
level
valley
perhaps
three
to
five
miles
broad
i
judge
distance
in
this
atmosphere
a
house
that
looks
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
is
two
miles
distant
at
the
extreme
end
in
a
little
gap
between
two
low
brown
hills
that
crossed
each
other
one
could
just
see
drive
off
behind
it
and
on
each
side
the
plain
mountains
of
every
conceivable
shape
and
colour
the
strangest
cliffs
and
peaks
and
crags
toppling
every
way
and
tinged
with
all
the
colours
of
opal
chiefly
delicate
pale
lilac
and
peach
colour
but
varied
with
red
brown
and
titian
green
in
spite
of
the
drought
water
sparkled
on
the
in
little
glittering
threads
and
here
and
there
in
the
plain
and
pretty
farms
were
dotted
on
either
side
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
slopes
toward
the
the
sky
of
such
a
blue
it
is
deeper
now
by
far
than
earlier
in
the
year
in
short
i
never
did
see
anything
so
beautiful
it
even
surpassed
holland
on
we
went
straight
along
the
valley
crossing
drift
after
drift
drift
is
the
bed
of
a
stream
more
or
less
dry
in
which
sometimes
you
are
drowned
sometimes
only
as
was
our
hap
the
track
was
incredibly
bad
except
for
short
bits
where
ironstone
prevailed
however
all
went
well
and
on
the
road
i
chased
and
captured
a
pair
of
remarkably
swift
and
handsome
little
that
you
may
duly
appreciate
such
a
feat
of
valour
and
activity
i
will
inform
you
that
their
english
name
is
on
the
strength
of
this
effort
we
drank
a
bottle
of
beer
as
it
was
very
hot
and
sandy
and
our
malay
was
a
enough
mussulman
to
take
his
full
share
in
a
modest
way
though
he
declined
wine
or
smoke
drams
with
aversion
no
sooner
had
we
got
under
weigh
again
than
sabaal
pulled
up
and
said
the
baviƒÅans
missis
want
to
see
and
so
they
were
at
some
distance
by
the
river
was
a
great
brute
bigger
than
a
newfoundland
dog
stalking
along
with
the
hideous
baboon
walk
and
tail
vehemently
cocked
up
a
troop
followed
at
a
distance
hiding
and
dodging
among
the
palmiets
they
were
evidently
to
rob
a
garden
close
to
them
and
had
sent
a
great
stout
fellow
ahead
to
reconnoitre
see
missis
and
feel
sure
she
not
got
a
gun
if
man
come
on
horseback
you
see
run
like
we
had
not
that
pleasure
and
left
them
on
felonious
thoughts
intent
the
road
got
more
and
more
beautiful
as
we
neared
worcester
and
the
mountains
grew
higher
and
craggier
presently
a
huge
bird
like
a
stork
on
the
wing
pounced
down
close
by
us
he
was
a
and
had
caught
sight
of
a
snake
we
passed
or
hot
spring
where
bubbles
up
in
a
basin
some
thirty
feet
across
and
ten
or
twelve
deep
the
water
is
clear
as
crystal
and
is
hot
enough
just
to
boil
an
egg
i
was
told
at
last
one
reaches
the
little
gap
between
the
brown
hills
which
one
has
seen
for
four
hours
and
drives
through
it
into
a
wide
wide
flat
with
still
craggier
and
higher
mountains
all
round
and
worcester
in
front
at
the
foot
of
a
towering
cliff
the
town
is
not
so
pretty
to
my
taste
as
the
little
villages
the
streets
are
too
wide
and
the
too
large
which
always
looks
dreary
but
the
houses
and
gardens
individually
are
charming
our
inn
is
a
very
nice
handsome
old
dutch
house
but
we
have
got
back
to
and
the
horrid
attempts
at
which
belong
to
capetown
the
landlord
and
lady
are
too
genteel
to
appear
at
all
and
the
hottentots
who
are
disguised
according
to
their
sexes
in
pantry
jacket
and
flounced
petticoat
understand
a
word
of
english
or
of
real
dutch
at
gnadenthal
they
understood
dutch
and
spoke
it
tolerably
but
here
as
in
most
places
it
is
hottentot
and
then
they
affect
to
understand
english
and
bring
everything
wrong
and
are
sulky
but
the
rooms
are
very
comfortable
the
change
of
climate
is
summer
was
over
at
caledon
and
here
we
are
into
it
most
delicious
air
one
can
conceive
it
must
have
been
a
perfect
oven
six
weeks
ago
the
birds
are
singing
away
merrily
still
the
approach
of
autumn
does
not
silence
them
here
the
canaries
have
a
very
pretty
song
like
our
linnet
only
sweeter
the
rest
are
very
inferior
to
ours
the
is
delicious
when
close
by
but
his
pipe
is
too
soft
to
be
heard
at
any
distance
to
those
who
think
voyages
and
travels
tiresome
my
delight
in
the
new
birds
and
beasts
and
people
must
seem
very
stupid
i
help
it
if
it
does
and
am
not
ashamed
to
confess
that
i
feel
the
old
sort
of
enchanted
wonder
with
which
i
used
to
read
voyages
and
the
like
as
a
child
it
is
very
coarse
and
unintellectual
of
me
but
i
would
rather
see
this
now
at
my
age
than
italy
the
fresh
new
beautiful
nature
is
a
second
vous
we
shall
cross
the
highest
pass
i
have
yet
crossed
and
sleep
at
stellenbosch
then
capetown
for
any
one
of
health
and
pocket
i
should
certainly
prescribe
the
purchase
of
a
waggon
and
team
of
six
horses
and
a
long
slow
progress
in
south
africa
one
can
not
walk
in
the
midday
sun
but
driving
with
a
very
light
roof
over
head
is
quite
delicious
when
i
looked
back
upon
my
dreary
lonely
prison
at
ventnor
i
wondered
i
had
survived
it
at
all
capetown
march
after
writing
last
we
drove
out
on
sunday
afternoon
to
a
deep
alpine
valley
to
see
a
great
marvel
apparently
the
old
spanish
joe
miller
about
selling
the
bridge
to
buy
water
occurred
to
me
and
made
sabaal
laugh
immensely
the
dutch
farmers
were
tearing
home
from
kerk
in
their
folks
with
capital
horses
such
lovely
farms
snugly
nestled
in
orange
and
pomegranate
groves
it
is
of
no
use
to
describe
this
scenery
it
is
always
mountains
and
always
beautiful
opal
mountains
quite
without
the
gloom
of
european
mountain
scenery
the
atmosphere
must
make
the
charm
i
hear
that
an
english
traveller
went
the
same
journey
and
found
all
barren
from
dan
to
beersheba
sorry
for
him
in
the
morning
of
sunday
early
i
walked
along
the
road
with
sabaal
and
saw
a
picture
i
shall
never
forget
a
little
malabar
girl
had
just
been
bathing
in
the
sloot
and
had
put
her
scanty
shift
on
her
lovely
little
wet
brown
body
she
stood
in
the
water
with
the
drops
glittering
on
her
brown
skin
and
black
satin
hair
the
perfection
of
youthful
naiad
of
ten
years
old
when
the
shape
and
features
are
as
hers
were
the
shows
it
better
than
our
colour
on
account
of
its
perfect
the
dead
white
of
marble
i
shall
never
forget
her
as
she
stood
playing
with
the
leaves
of
the
which
hung
over
her
and
gazing
with
her
glorious
eyes
so
placidly
on
monday
morning
i
walked
off
early
to
the
old
house
found
an
old
gentleman
who
turned
out
to
be
the
owner
and
who
asked
me
my
name
and
all
the
rest
of
the
dutch
of
questions
and
showed
me
the
pretty
old
dutch
garden
and
the
very
handsome
one
i
walked
back
to
breakfast
and
thought
worcester
the
prettiest
place
i
had
ever
seen
we
then
started
for
paarl
and
drove
through
a
splendid
four
long
constant
driving
it
was
glorious
but
more
like
what
one
had
seen
in
deep
narrow
gorge
almost
dark
in
places
and
to
my
mind
lacked
the
of
the
drive
though
it
is
perhaps
grander
but
the
view
which
bursts
on
one
at
the
top
and
the
descent
winding
down
the
open
is
too
fine
to
describe
table
mountain
like
a
stronghold
seen
far
distant
with
an
immense
plain
half
fertile
half
white
sand
to
the
left
vley
and
further
on
the
paarl
lying
scattered
on
the
slope
of
a
mountain
topped
with
two
just
the
shape
of
the
cup
which
lais
it
presented
to
the
temple
of
venus
moulded
on
her
breast
the
horses
were
tired
so
we
stopped
at
valley
or
wellington
as
the
english
try
to
get
it
called
and
found
ourselves
in
a
true
flemish
village
and
under
the
roof
of
a
jolly
dutch
hostess
who
gave
us
divine
coffee
and
which
seemed
ambrosia
after
being
deprived
of
those
luxuries
for
almost
three
months
also
new
milk
in
abundance
besides
fruit
of
all
kinds
in
vast
heaps
and
pomegranates
off
the
tree
i
asked
her
to
buy
me
a
few
to
take
in
the
cart
and
got
a
the
third
of
a
sack
for
a
shilling
with
a
bill
bekomt
muid
granaeten
dat
kostet
the
old
lady
would
walk
out
with
me
and
take
me
into
the
shops
to
show
the
uit
to
her
friends
it
was
a
lovely
place
intensely
hot
all
glowing
with
sunshine
then
the
sun
went
down
and
the
high
mountains
behind
us
were
precisely
the
colour
of
a
venice
ruby
truly
and
literally
purple
not
crimson
but
glowing
the
and
below
looked
green
and
the
houses
it
was
a
less
i
saw
hottentots
again
four
of
them
from
some
remote
corner
so
the
race
is
not
quite
extinct
these
were
youngish
two
men
and
two
women
quite
light
yellow
not
darker
than
europeans
and
with
little
tiny
black
knots
of
wool
scattered
over
their
heads
at
intervals
they
are
hideous
in
face
but
exquisitely
very
small
though
one
of
the
men
was
drunk
poor
wretch
and
looked
the
picture
of
misery
you
can
see
the
fineness
of
their
senses
by
the
way
in
which
they
dart
their
glances
and
prick
their
ears
every
one
agrees
that
when
tamed
they
make
the
best
of
clever
and
honest
but
the
wine
they
resist
unless
when
caught
and
tamed
young
they
work
in
the
fields
or
did
so
as
long
as
any
were
left
but
even
here
i
was
told
it
was
a
wonder
to
see
them
we
went
on
through
the
paarl
a
sweet
pretty
place
reminding
one
vaguely
of
bonchurch
and
still
through
fine
mountains
with
scotch
firs
growing
like
italian
stone
pines
and
farms
and
vineyard
upon
vineyard
at
stellenbosch
we
stopped
i
had
been
told
it
was
the
prettiest
town
in
the
colony
and
it
very
pretty
with
all
along
the
street
like
those
at
paarl
and
wagenmakkers
vley
but
i
was
disappointed
it
was
less
beautiful
than
what
i
had
seen
besides
the
evening
was
dull
and
cold
the
greeted
us
here
and
i
could
not
go
out
all
the
afternoon
the
inn
was
called
and
kept
by
low
coarse
english
people
who
gave
us
a
filthy
dinner
dirty
sheets
and
an
atrocious
breakfast
and
charged
for
the
same
meals
and
time
as
old
vrow
langfeldt
had
charged
for
and
had
given
civility
cleanliness
and
abundance
of
excellent
food
which
she
fed
sabaal
gratis
and
these
people
fleeced
him
as
they
did
me
so
next
morning
we
set
off
less
pleasantly
disposed
for
capetown
over
the
flat
which
is
dreary
enough
and
had
a
horrid
we
started
early
and
got
in
before
the
wind
became
a
hurricane
which
it
did
later
we
were
warmly
welcomed
by
and
here
i
am
in
my
old
room
looking
over
the
beautiful
bay
quite
at
home
again
it
blew
all
yesterday
and
having
rather
a
i
stayed
in
bed
and
is
all
bright
and
beautiful
but
capetown
looks
murky
after
caledon
and
worcester
there
is
to
my
eyes
quite
a
haze
over
the
mountains
and
they
look
far
off
and
indistinct
all
is
comparative
in
this
world
even
african
skies
at
caledon
the
most
distant
mountains
as
far
as
your
eye
can
reach
look
as
clear
in
every
detail
as
the
map
on
your
appearance
utterly
new
to
european
eyes
i
gave
sabaal
for
his
eight
service
as
driver
as
a
drinkgelt
and
the
worthy
fellow
was
in
ecstasies
of
gratitude
next
morning
early
he
appeared
with
a
present
of
bananas
and
his
little
girl
dressed
from
head
to
foot
in
clothes
bought
out
of
my
money
with
her
wool
screwed
up
extremely
tight
in
little
knots
on
her
black
little
head
evidently
her
mother
is
the
blackest
of
caffres
or
mozambiques
the
child
looked
like
a
caffre
and
her
father
considers
her
quite
a
pearl
i
had
her
in
and
admired
the
little
thing
loud
enough
for
him
to
hear
outside
as
i
lay
in
bed
you
see
i
too
was
to
have
my
share
in
the
pleasure
of
the
new
clothes
this
readiness
to
believe
that
one
will
sympathize
with
them
is
very
pleasing
in
the
malays
march
i
went
to
see
my
old
malay
friends
and
to
buy
a
they
were
in
all
the
misery
of
ramadan
betsy
and
pretty
nassirah
very
thin
and
miserable
and
the
pious
old
abdool
sitting
on
a
little
barrel
waiting
for
sunset
to
fall
to
on
the
supper
which
old
betsy
was
setting
out
he
was
silent
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
were
drawn
down
just
like
at
an
evening
party
i
shall
go
to
bid
the
at
wynberg
i
was
to
have
spent
a
few
days
there
but
wynberg
is
cold
at
night
and
dampish
so
i
declined
that
she
is
a
nice
and
so
innocent
and
frank
and
she
has
been
at
cold
bokke
veld
and
shocked
her
puritanical
host
by
admiring
the
naked
caffres
who
worked
on
his
farm
he
wanted
them
to
wear
clothes
we
have
been
amused
by
the
airs
of
a
naval
captain
and
his
wife
who
are
just
come
here
they
complained
that
the
officers
spoke
to
their
children
on
board
when
i
think
of
the
excellent
modest
manly
young
fellows
who
talked
very
familiarly
and
pleasantly
to
me
on
board
the
i
long
to
reprimand
these
foolish
people
am
just
come
from
prayer
at
the
mosque
in
chiappini
street
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
a
most
striking
sight
a
large
room
like
a
county
with
glass
chandeliers
carpeted
with
common
carpet
all
but
a
space
at
the
entrance
railed
off
for
shoes
the
caaba
and
pulpit
at
one
end
over
the
niche
a
crescent
painted
and
over
the
entrance
door
a
crescent
an
arabic
inscription
and
the
royal
arms
of
england
a
fat
jolly
mollah
looked
amazed
as
i
ascended
the
steps
but
when
i
touched
my
forehead
and
said
he
laughed
and
said
salaam
come
in
come
the
faithful
poured
in
all
neatly
dressed
in
their
loose
drab
trousers
blue
jackets
and
red
handkerchiefs
on
their
heads
they
left
their
wooden
clogs
in
company
with
my
shoes
and
proceeded
as
it
appeared
to
strip
off
went
jackets
waistcoats
and
trousers
with
the
dexterity
of
a
pantomime
transformation
the
red
handkerchief
was
replaced
by
a
white
skullcap
and
a
long
large
white
shirt
and
full
white
drawers
flowed
around
them
how
it
had
all
been
stuffed
into
the
trim
jacket
and
trousers
one
could
not
conceive
gay
sashes
and
scarves
were
pulled
out
of
a
little
bundle
in
a
clean
silk
handkerchief
and
a
towel
served
as
in
a
moment
the
whole
scene
was
as
oriental
as
if
the
hansom
cab
i
had
come
in
existed
no
more
women
suckled
their
children
and
boys
played
among
the
clogs
and
shoes
all
the
time
and
i
sat
on
the
floor
in
a
remote
corner
the
chanting
was
very
fine
and
the
whole
ceremony
very
decorous
and
solemn
it
lasted
an
hour
and
then
the
little
heaps
of
garments
were
put
on
and
the
congregation
dispersed
each
man
first
laying
a
penny
on
a
very
curious
little
old
heavy
chest
which
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
i
have
just
heard
that
the
post
closes
and
must
say
letter
xi
capetown
march
dearest
mother
shea
says
he
fears
i
must
not
winter
in
england
yet
but
that
i
am
greatly
indeed
i
could
tell
him
he
is
another
of
the
kind
i
have
met
with
he
came
all
the
way
from
bay
to
see
me
and
then
said
nonsense
is
that
when
i
offered
him
a
fee
this
is
a
very
nice
place
up
in
the
quite
out
of
the
town
and
very
comfortable
but
i
regret
caledon
will
show
you
my
account
of
my
beautiful
journey
back
worcester
is
a
and
then
to
catch
tortoises
walking
about
and
to
see
and
snakes
and
secretary
birds
eating
them
and
then
people
have
the
impudence
to
think
i
must
have
been
dull
that
it
is
who
are
dull
dear
hawtrey
he
must
have
died
just
as
i
was
packing
up
the
first
caffre
testament
for
him
i
felt
his
death
very
much
in
connexion
with
my
father
their
regard
for
each
other
was
an
honour
to
both
i
have
the
letter
he
wrote
me
on
marriage
and
a
charming
one
it
is
i
took
a
drive
in
a
hansom
cab
out
to
wynberg
to
see
my
friends
captain
and
who
have
a
cottage
under
table
mountain
in
a
spot
like
the
best
of
hill
very
dull
too
but
as
she
is
really
a
lady
it
suits
her
and
capetown
does
not
i
was
to
have
stayed
with
them
but
wynberg
is
cold
at
night
poor
wife
is
very
ill
and
leave
capetown
for
a
day
the
people
here
are
for
that
a
lady
born
here
and
with
a
year
has
never
been
further
than
stellenbosch
about
twenty
miles
i
am
asked
how
i
lived
and
what
i
ate
during
my
little
excursion
as
if
i
had
been
to
lake
ngami
if
only
i
had
known
how
easy
it
all
is
i
would
have
gone
by
sea
to
east
london
and
seen
the
knysna
and
george
district
and
the
prim√¶val
african
forest
the
yellow
wood
and
other
giant
trees
however
what
i
have
received
no
one
can
conceive
what
it
is
after
two
years
of
prison
and
utter
languor
to
stand
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
pass
and
enjoy
physical
existence
for
a
few
hours
at
a
time
i
felt
as
if
it
was
quite
selfish
to
enjoy
anything
so
much
when
you
were
all
so
anxious
about
me
at
home
but
as
that
is
the
best
symptom
of
all
i
do
not
repent
has
been
an
excellent
travelling
servant
and
really
a
better
companion
than
many
more
educated
people
for
she
is
always
amused
and
curious
and
is
friendly
with
the
coloured
people
she
is
quite
recovered
it
is
a
wonderful
que
cel√†
it
feels
chilly
and
it
blows
horridly
and
does
not
seem
genial
but
it
gives
new
life
i
am
going
with
old
abdool
jemaalee
to
prayers
at
the
mosque
and
shall
see
a
school
kept
by
a
malay
priest
it
is
now
ramadan
and
my
muslim
friends
are
very
thin
and
look
glum
choslullah
sent
a
message
to
ask
he
see
the
missis
once
more
he
should
pray
all
the
time
she
was
on
the
some
pious
christians
here
would
expect
such
horrors
to
sink
the
ship
i
think
why
mussulmans
are
always
gentlemen
the
malay
coolies
have
a
grave
courtesy
which
contrasts
most
strikingly
with
both
european
vulgarity
and
negro
jollity
it
is
very
curious
for
they
only
speak
dutch
and
know
nothing
of
oriental
manners
i
fear
i
shall
not
see
the
walkers
again
bay
is
too
far
to
go
and
come
in
a
day
as
one
can
not
go
out
before
ten
or
eleven
and
must
be
in
by
five
or
those
hours
are
gloriously
bright
and
hot
but
morning
and
night
are
cold
i
am
so
happy
in
the
thought
of
sailing
now
so
very
soon
and
seeing
you
all
again
that
i
can
settle
to
nothing
for
five
minutes
i
now
feel
how
anxious
and
uneasy
i
have
been
and
how
i
shall
rejoice
to
get
home
i
shall
leave
a
letter
for
to
go
in
april
and
tell
him
and
you
what
ship
i
am
in
i
shall
choose
the
so
as
not
to
reach
england
and
face
the
channel
before
june
if
possible
so
be
alarmed
if
i
do
not
arrive
till
late
in
june
till
then
and
god
bless
you
dearest

letter

capetown
sunday
march
it
has
been
a
hot
day
and
threatened
an
earthquake
and
a
thunderstorm
but
nothing
has
come
of
it
beyond
sheet
lightning
which
is
splendid
over
the
bay
and
looks
as
if
repeated
in
a
grand
on
the
hills
opposite
the
sunset
was
glorious
that
rarest
of
insects
the
praying
mantis
has
just
dropped
upon
my
paper
i
am
thankful
that
not
being
an
entomologist
i
am
dispensed
from
the
sacred
duty
of
impaling
the
lovely
green
creature
who
sits
there
looking
quite
wise
and
human
fussy
little
brown
beetles
as
big
as
two
keep
flying
into
my
eyes
and
the
musquitoes
are
rejoicing
loudly
in
the
prospect
of
a
feast
you
will
understand
by
this
that
both
windows
are
wide
open
into
the
great
verandah
unusual
in
this
land
of
cold
nights
have
been
trying
in
vain
to
get
a
passage
home
the
has
not
come
in
short
i
am
waiting
for
a
chance
vessel
and
shall
pack
up
now
and
be
ready
to
go
on
board
at
a
notice
i
went
on
the
last
evening
of
ramadan
to
the
mosque
having
heard
there
was
a
grand
but
there
were
only
little
boys
lying
about
on
the
floor
some
on
their
stomachs
some
on
their
backs
if
it
be
not
profane
to
apply
the
phrase
to
young
islam
all
shouting
their
prayers
tue
priests
men
women
and
english
crowded
in
and
out
in
the
exterior
division
the
english
behaved
each
other
laughed
sneered
and
made
a
disgusting
display
of
themselves
i
asked
a
stately
priest
in
a
red
turban
to
explain
the
affair
to
me
and
in
a
few
minutes
found
myself
supplied
by
one
mollah
with
a
chair
and
by
another
with
a
cup
of
in
short
in
the
midst
of
a
malay
they
spoke
english
very
little
but
made
up
for
it
by
their
usual
good
breeding
and
intelligence
on
monday
i
am
going
to
see
the
school
which
the
priest
keeps
at
his
house
and
to
his
house
by
my
the
delight
they
show
at
any
friendly
interest
taken
in
them
is
wonderful
of
course
i
am
supposed
to
be
poisoned
a
widow
here
gravely
asserts
that
her
husband
went
mad
after
drinking
a
cup
of
coffee
handed
to
him
by
a
malay
in
consequence
of
drinking
it
it
is
exactly
like
the
medi√¶val
feeling
about
the
jews
i
saw
that
it
was
quite
a
that
i
drank
up
the
tea
unhesitatingly
considering
that
the
malays
drank
it
themselves
my
courage
deserves
less
admiration
but
it
was
a
quaint
sensation
to
sit
in
a
mosque
behaving
as
if
at
an
evening
party
in
a
little
circle
of
poor
moslim
priests
i
am
going
to
have
a
photograph
of
my
cart
done
i
was
to
have
gone
to
the
place
but
when
choslullah
whom
i
sent
for
to
complete
the
picture
found
out
what
i
wanted
he
implored
me
to
put
it
off
till
monday
that
he
might
be
better
dressed
and
was
so
unhappy
at
the
notion
of
being
immortalized
in
an
old
jacket
that
i
agreed
to
the
delay
such
a
handsome
fellow
may
be
allowed
a
little
vanity
the
colony
is
torn
with
dissensions
as
to
sunday
trains
some
of
the
dutch
clergy
are
even
more
absurd
than
our
own
on
that
point
a
certain
van
der
lingen
at
stellenbosch
calls
europe
vast
and
so
forth
there
is
altogether
a
nice
kettle
of
religious
hatred
brewing
here
the
english
bishop
of
capetown
appoints
all
the
english
clergy
and
is
absolute
monarch
of
all
he
surveys
and
he
and
his
clergy
are
carrying
matters
with
a
high
hand
the
chaplain
told
that
she
could
not
hope
for
salvation
in
the
dutch
church
since
her
clergy
were
not
ordained
by
any
bishop
and
therefore
they
could
only
administer
the
sacrament
all
the
physicians
in
a
body
english
as
well
as
dutch
have
withdrawn
from
the
dispensary
because
it
was
used
as
a
means
of
pressure
to
draw
the
coloured
people
from
the
dutch
to
the
english
church
this
tyranny
can
not
go
on
long
catholics
there
are
few
but
their
bishop
plays
the
same
game
and
it
is
a
losing
one
the
irish
maid
at
the
caledon
inn
was
driven
by
her
bishop
to
be
married
at
the
lutheran
church
just
as
a
young
englishman
i
know
though
a
fervent
puseyite
was
driven
to
be
married
at
the
scotch
kirk
the
colonial
bishops
are
despots
in
their
own
churches
and
there
is
no
escape
from
their
tyranny
but
by
dissent
the
admiral
and
his
family
have
been
anathematized
for
going
to
a
fancy
bazaar
given
by
the
wesleyans
for
their
chapel
i
failed
about
my
cart
photograph
first
the
owner
had
sent
away
the
cart
and
when
choslullah
came
dressed
in
all
his
best
clothes
with
a
lovely
blue
handkerchief
setting
off
his
beautiful
face
he
had
to
rush
off
to
try
to
borrow
another
cart
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
he
met
a
young
with
no
front
teeth
and
a
hideous
wen
on
his
eyebrow
who
informed
the
priest
of
impious
purpose
and
came
with
him
to
see
that
he
did
sit
for
his
portrait
i
believe
it
was
half
envy
for
my
handsome
driver
was
as
pleased
and
then
as
disappointed
as
a
young
lady
about
her
first
ball
and
obviously
had
no
religious
scruples
of
his
own
on
the
subject
the
weather
is
very
delightful
but
beautiful
and
the
though
violent
are
short
and
not
cold
as
in
all
other
countries
autumn
is
the
best
time
of
year
letters
arrived
yesterday
to
my
great
delight
i
have
been
worrying
about
a
ship
and
was
very
near
sailing
by
the
of
the
at
notice
but
i
have
resolved
to
wait
for
the
the
of
the
is
a
steamer
is
odious
for
they
pitch
the
coal
all
over
the
lower
deck
so
that
you
breathe
for
the
first
ten
days
then
she
was
one
cabin
vacant
and
that
small
and
on
the
lower
children
on
board
moreover
she
will
probably
get
to
england
too
soon
so
i
resign
myself
to
wait
the
has
only
cabins
and
i
shall
have
fresh
air
i
am
not
as
well
as
i
was
at
caledon
so
i
am
all
the
more
anxious
to
have
a
voyage
likely
to
do
me
good
instead
of
harm
i
got
my
cart
and
choslullah
photographed
after
all
choslullah
came
next
day
having
got
rid
of
his
pious
friend
quite
resolved
that
should
take
his
portrait
so
i
will
send
or
bring
a
few
copies
of
my
beloved
cart
after
the
photograph
was
done
we
drove
round
the
kloof
between
table
and
lion
mountain
the
road
is
cut
on
the
side
of
lion
mountain
and
overhangs
the
sea
at
a
great
height
camp
bay
which
lies
on
the
further
side
of
the
is
most
lovely
never
was
sea
so
deeply
blue
rocks
so
warmly
brown
or
sand
and
foam
so
glittering
white
and
down
at
the
the
bright
green
of
the
orange
and
pomegranate
trees
throws
it
all
out
in
greater
relief
but
the
atmosphere
here
do
after
that
of
the
as
the
caledon
line
of
country
is
called
i
shall
never
lose
the
impression
of
the
view
i
had
when
morkel
drove
me
out
on
a
where
the
view
seemed
endless
and
without
a
vestige
of
life
and
yet
in
every
valley
there
were
farms
but
it
looked
a
vast
utter
solitude
and
without
the
least
haze
you
know
what
that
utter
clearness
distinctness
is
quite
awful
here
it
is
always
slightly
hazy
very
pretty
and
warm
but
it
takes
off
from
the
grandeur
it
is
the
difference
between
a
pretty
pompadour
beauty
and
a
greek
statue
those
pale
opal
mountains
as
distinct
in
every
detail
as
the
map
on
your
table
are
so
cheerful
and
serene
no
melodramatic
effects
of
clouds
and
gloom
i
suppose
it
is
not
really
so
beautiful
as
it
seemed
to
me
for
other
people
say
it
is
bare
and
desolate
and
certainly
it
is
but
it
seemed
to
me
anything
but
dreary
i
am
persuaded
that
capetown
is
not
healthy
indeed
the
town
be
from
its
stench
and
dirt
but
i
believe
the
whole
seashore
is
more
or
less
bad
compared
to
the
upper
plateaux
of
which
i
know
only
the
first
i
should
have
gone
back
to
paarl
only
that
ships
come
and
go
within
hours
so
one
has
the
pleasure
of
living
in
constant
expectation
with
packed
trunks
wondering
when
one
shall
get
away
a
clever
who
has
lived
india
and
is
going
back
to
singapore
with
his
wife
and
child
are
now
in
the
house
and
some
very
pleasant
jews
bound
for
british
of
them
has
a
lovely
little
wife
and
three
children
she
is
very
full
of
prince
death
and
says
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
in
the
synagogues
in
london
which
were
all
hung
with
black
on
the
day
of
his
funeral
and
prayer
went
on
the
whole
day
mourned
for
him
as
much
as
for
hezekiah
and
indeed
he
deserved
it
a
great
deal
better
was
her
rather
unorthodox
conclusion
these
colonial
jews
are
a
new
to
me
they
have
the
features
of
their
race
but
many
of
their
peculiarities
are
gone
who
is
very
handsome
and
gentlemanly
eats
ham
and
patronises
a
good
breed
of
pigs
on
the
on
which
he
spends
his
money
he
is
he
says
a
thorough
jew
in
faith
and
evidently
in
charitable
works
but
he
wants
to
say
his
prayers
in
english
and
not
to
himself
in
a
veil
and
phylacteries
for
the
purpose
and
he
and
his
wife
talk
of
england
as
and
care
as
much
for
jerusalem
as
their
neighbours
they
have
not
forgotten
the
old
persecutions
and
are
civil
to
the
coloured
people
and
speak
of
them
in
quite
a
different
tone
from
other
english
colonists
moreover
they
are
far
better
mannered
and
more
in
the
german
sense
of
the
word
in
all
respects
short
less
i
have
bought
some
cape
apricots
salted
and
then
sugared
called
also
pickled
peaches
and
quince
jelly
i
have
a
notion
of
some
cherupiga
wine
for
ourselves
i
will
inquire
the
cost
of
bottling
packing
it
is
about
one
shilling
and
fourpence
a
bottle
here
sweet
red
wine
unlike
any
other
i
ever
drank
and
i
think
very
good
it
is
very
tempting
to
bring
a
few
things
so
unknown
in
england
i
have
a
glorious
for
you
a
blanket
of
nine
damara
sheepskins
sewn
by
the
damaras
and
dressed
so
that
moths
and
fleas
stay
near
them
it
will
make
a
grand
railway
rug
and
covering
the
hunters
use
them
for
sleeping
out
of
doors
i
have
bought
three
and
a
springbok
caross
for
somebody
winter
has
set
in
it
rains
steadily
at
the
rate
of
the
heaviest
bit
of
the
heaviest
shower
in
england
and
is
as
cold
as
a
bad
day
early
in
september
one
can
just
sit
without
a
fire
presently
all
will
be
green
and
gay
for
winter
is
here
the
season
of
flowers
and
the
heaths
will
cover
the
country
with
a
vast
turkey
carpet
already
the
green
is
appearing
where
all
was
brown
yesterday
is
good
friday
and
if
christmas
seemed
odd
at
midsummer
easter
in
autumn
seems
positively
unnatural
our
jewish
party
made
their
exodus
by
the
little
coasting
steamer
to
algoa
bay
i
rather
condoled
with
the
pretty
little
woman
about
her
long
rough
journey
with
three
babies
but
she
laughed
and
said
they
had
had
time
to
get
used
to
it
ever
since
the
days
of
moses
all
she
grieved
over
was
not
being
able
to
keep
passover
and
she
described
their
domestic
ceremonies
quite
poetically
we
heard
from
our
former
housemaid
annie
the
other
day
announcing
her
marriage
and
her
she
wrote
such
a
pretty
merry
letter
to
saying
more
she
tried
not
to
like
him
the
better
she
loved
him
and
had
to
say
annie
caught
at
a
year
and
a
half
is
a
long
time
to
remain
single
in
this
country
mail
goes
out
in
an
hour
so
i
will
just
add
the
winter
is
now
fairly
set
in
and
i
long
to
be
off
i
fear
i
shall
have
a
desperately
cold
week
or
so
at
first
sailing
till
we
catch
the
trades
this
weather
is
beautiful
in
itself
but
i
feel
it
from
the
suddenness
of
the
change
we
passed
in
one
night
from
hot
summer
to
winter
which
is
like
english
april
or
october
only
brighter
than
anything
in
europe
there
is
properly
no
autumn
or
spring
here
only
hot
dry
brown
summer
with
its
cold
wind
at
times
and
fresh
green
winter
all
fragrance
and
flowers
and
much
less
wind
of
whom
i
told
you
has
been
in
every
corner
of
the
far
sumatra
is
extremely
amusing
he
has
brought
his
wife
here
for
her
health
and
is
as
glad
to
talk
as
i
am
the
conversation
of
an
educated
clever
person
is
quite
a
new
and
delightful
sensation
to
me
now
he
appears
to
have
held
high
posts
under
the
east
india
company
is
learned
in
oriental
languages
and
was
last
resident
at
singapore
he
says
that
no
doubt
java
is
paradise
it
is
so
lovely
and
such
a
climate
but
he
does
not
look
as
if
it
had
agreed
with
him
i
feel
quite
at
seeing
these
letters
go
off
before
me
instead
of
leaving
them
behind
as
i
had
hoped
well
i
must
say
rather
god
knows
how
glad
i
shall
be
when
that
day
comes
letter
xiii
capetown
april
dearest
mother
here
i
am
waiting
for
a
ship
the
steamer
was
too
horrid
and
i
look
so
much
to
the
good
to
be
gained
by
the
voyage
that
i
did
not
like
to
throw
away
the
chance
of
two
months
at
sea
at
this
favourable
time
of
year
and
under
favourable
circumstances
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
see
you
all
a
month
later
the
sea
just
off
the
cape
is
very
very
cold
less
so
now
than
in
spring
i
dare
say
the
weather
is
just
like
warm
april
at
sunshiny
and
fragrant
most
lovely
it
is
so
odd
to
see
an
autumn
without
dead
leaves
only
the
oaks
lose
theirs
the
old
ones
drop
without
turning
brown
and
the
trees
bud
again
at
once
the
rest
put
on
a
darker
green
dress
for
winter
and
now
the
flowers
will
begin
i
have
got
a
picture
for
you
of
my
and
with
sedate
choslullah
and
dear
little
mohammed
the
former
wants
to
go
with
me
as
he
placidly
said
be
the
what
a
sensation
his
thatchlike
hat
and
handsome
face
would
make
at
esher
such
a
stalwart
henchman
would
be
very
creditable
i
shall
grieve
to
think
i
shall
never
see
my
malay
friends
again
they
are
the
only
people
here
who
are
really
interesting
i
think
they
must
be
like
the
turks
in
manner
as
they
have
all
the
eastern
gentlemanly
ease
and
politeness
and
no
eastern
obsequiousness
and
no
idea
of
baksheesh
withal
frugal
industrious
and
to
an
astonishing
degree
the
priest
is
a
bit
of
a
proselytiser
and
amused
me
much
with
an
account
of
how
he
had
converted
english
girls
from
their
evil
courses
and
made
them
good
i
never
heard
a
and
sincere
account
of
conversions
christianity
before
and
i
must
own
it
was
much
milder
than
the
exeter
hall
style
i
have
heard
a
great
many
expressions
of
sorrow
for
the
queen
from
the
malays
and
always
with
the
the
people
will
take
much
care
of
her
now
she
is
of
course
prince
albert
was
only
the
husband
to
them
and
all
their
feeling
is
about
her
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
anything
of
them
for
they
want
nothing
of
you
and
expect
nothing
but
dislike
and
contempt
it
would
take
a
long
time
to
make
many
friends
as
they
are
naturally
distrustful
i
found
that
eating
or
drinking
anything
if
they
offer
it
made
most
way
as
they
know
they
are
accused
of
poisoning
all
christians
indiscriminately
of
course
therefore
they
are
shy
of
offering
things
i
drank
tea
in
the
mosque
at
the
end
of
ramadan
and
was
surrounded
by
delighted
faces
as
i
sipped
the
little
boy
who
waits
in
this
house
here
had
followed
us
and
was
horrified
he
is
still
waiting
to
see
the
poison
work
no
one
can
conceive
what
has
become
of
all
the
ships
that
usually
touch
here
about
this
time
i
was
promised
my
choice
of
and
and
now
only
the
heavy
old
is
expected
with
rice
from
moulmein
a
lady
now
here
who
has
been
heaven
only
knows
praises
alexandria
above
all
other
places
after
suez
her
lungs
are
bad
and
she
swears
by
suez
which
she
says
is
the
dreariest
and
healthiest
for
lungs
place
in
the
world
you
think
how
soon
one
learns
to
if
not
time
in
thoughts
by
daily
reading
advertisements
for
every
port
in
india
america
australia
and
conversing
with
people
who
have
just
come
from
the
of
the
meanwhile
i
fear
i
shall
have
to
fly
from
next
winter
again
and
certainly
will
go
with
to
egypt
which
seems
to
me
like
next
door
i
have
run
on
and
not
thanked
you
for
your
letter
and
beautiful
of
hallam
which
pleased
me
greatly
i
wish
englishmen
could
learn
to
speak
with
the
same
good
taste
and
wodehouse
who
has
been
very
civil
to
me
kindly
tried
to
get
me
a
passage
home
in
a
french
frigate
lying
here
but
in
vain
i
am
now
sorry
i
let
the
jack
tars
here
persuade
me
not
to
go
in
the
little
barque
but
they
talked
so
much
of
the
heat
and
damp
of
such
tiny
cabins
in
an
iron
vessel
that
i
gave
her
up
though
i
liked
the
idea
of
a
good
tossing
in
such
a
tiny
cockboat
i
will
leave
a
letter
for
the
may
mail
unless
i
sail
within
a
week
of
or
go
by
the
which
would
be
home
far
sooner
than
the
mail
i
only
hope
you
and
be
uneasy
the
worst
that
can
happen
is
delay
and
the
long
voyage
will
be
all
gain
to
health
which
would
not
be
the
case
in
a
steamer
all
i
hear
of
makes
me
wild
to
see
her
again
the
little
darkies
are
the
only
pleasing
children
here
and
a
fat
black
toddling
thing
is
i
know
a
boy
of
four
literally
jet
black
whom
i
long
to
steal
as
he
follows
his
mother
up
to
the
mountain
to
little
malays
are
lovely
but
and
quiet
i
tried
to
get
a
real
or
but
the
people
were
too
drunk
to
remember
where
they
had
left
their
child
assez
that
i
should
have
had
no
scruple
in
buying
it
for
a
bottle
of
the
spirit
made
from
grape
husks
they
are
clever
and
affectionate
when
they
have
a
chance
poor
things
so
strange
to
look
at
by
the
bye
a
bonn
man
bleek
called
here
with
from
our
old
friends
professor
mendelssohn
and
his
wife
he
is
devoting
himself
to
hottentot
and
aboriginal
literature
has
actually
mastered
the
caffre
which
i
vainly
practised
under
tuition
he
wanted
to
teach
me
to
say
which
means
or
have
in
shooting
or
throwing
a
stone
curious
combination
of
meanings
he
taught
me
to
throw
stones
or
a
stick
at
him
which
he
always
avoided
however
close
they
fell
and
cried
the
caffres
ask
for
a
present
gift
for
the
farnese
hercules
is
a
living
i
saw
him
in
the
street
two
days
ago
and
he
was
a
caffre
coolie
the
proportions
of
the
head
and
throat
were
more
wonderful
in
flesh
or
muscle
rather
than
in
marble
i
know
a
caffre
girl
of
thirteen
who
is
a
noble
model
of
strength
and
beauty
such
an
than
any
white
such
a
dimple
in
her
elbow
and
a
wrist
and
hand
which
no
glove
is
small
enough
to
a
noble
countenance
too
she
is
a
name
for
temporary
slavery
and
is
highly
spoken
of
as
a
servant
as
the
caffres
always
are
they
are
a
majestic
race
but
with
just
the
stupid
conceit
of
a
certain
sort
of
englishmen
the
women
and
girls
seem
charming
weather
continues
beautifully
clear
and
bright
like
the
finest
european
spring
it
seems
so
strange
for
the
floral
season
to
be
the
winter
but
as
the
wind
blows
the
air
is
quite
cold
nevertheless
i
feel
much
better
the
last
two
days
the
brewing
of
the
rain
made
the
air
very
oppressive
and
heavy
for
three
weeks
but
now
it
is
as
light
as
possible
i
must
say
as
the
mail
closes
morning
easter
in
autumn
is
preposterous
only
the
autumn
looks
like
spring
the
consumptive
young
girl
whom
i
packed
off
to
the
cape
and
her
sister
are
about
to
be
course
annie
has
had
a
touch
of
algoa
bay
fever
a
mild
kind
of
ague
but
no
sign
of
chest
disease
or
even
delicacy
my
her
which
some
people
thought
so
cruel
has
saved
her
whoever
comes
recovers
but
for
people
far
gone
it
is
too
bracing
letter
xiv
capetown
saturday
may
dearest
mother
after
five
weeks
of
waiting
and
worry
i
have
at
last
sent
my
goods
on
board
the
ship
now
discharging
her
cargo
and
about
to
take
a
small
party
of
passengers
from
the
cape
i
offered
to
take
a
cabin
in
a
swedish
ship
bound
for
falmouth
but
the
captain
could
not
decide
whether
he
would
take
a
passenger
and
while
he
hesitated
the
old
came
in
i
have
the
best
cabin
after
the
stern
cabins
which
are
occupied
by
the
captain
and
his
wife
and
the
of
capetown
who
is
much
liked
the
other
passengers
are
quiet
people
and
few
of
them
and
the
captain
has
a
high
character
so
i
may
hope
for
a
comfortable
though
slow
passage
i
will
let
you
know
the
day
i
sail
and
leave
this
letter
to
go
by
post
i
may
be
looked
for
three
weeks
or
so
after
this
letter
i
am
crazy
to
get
home
now
after
the
period
was
over
for
which
i
had
made
up
my
mind
began
has
offered
me
a
darling
tiny
monkey
which
loves
me
but
i
fear
would
send
me
away
again
if
i
returned
with
her
in
my
pocket
nassirah
old
pretty
granddaughter
brought
me
a
pair
of
malay
shoes
or
clogs
as
a
parting
gift
the
resident
at
singapore
tells
me
that
his
wife
a
malay
lady
has
made
an
excellent
translation
of
the
from
arabic
into
malay
her
husband
is
an
indian
mussulman
who
said
was
one
of
the
ablest
men
he
ever
knew
curious
i
sat
yesterday
for
an
hour
in
the
stall
of
a
poor
german
who
had
been
long
in
his
wife
a
berlinerin
was
very
intelligent
and
her
account
of
her
life
here
most
entertaining
as
showing
the
different
natural
to
germans
had
she
said
out
of
the
city
of
berlin
and
compare
with
london
cockney
or
genuine
parisian
thence
her
fear
on
landing
at
algoa
bay
and
seeing
swarms
of
naked
black
men
that
she
had
come
to
a
country
where
no
clothes
were
to
be
had
and
what
should
she
do
when
hers
were
worn
out
they
had
a
grant
of
land
at
fort
peddie
and
she
dug
while
her
husband
made
baskets
of
cane
and
carried
them
hundreds
of
miles
for
sale
sleeping
and
eating
in
caffre
huts
they
are
good
honest
people
and
very
though
they
go
as
naked
as
god
made
them
the
girls
are
pretty
and
very
delicate
and
they
think
no
harm
of
it
the
dear
if
their
cattle
strayed
it
was
always
brought
back
and
they
received
every
sort
of
kindness
madam
it
is
shocking
how
people
here
treat
the
blacks
they
call
quite
an
old
man
and
speak
so
scornfully
and
yet
the
blacks
have
very
nice
manners
i
assure
when
i
looked
at
the
poor
little
wizened
pale
sickly
berliner
and
fancied
him
a
guest
in
a
caffre
hut
it
seemed
an
odd
picture
but
he
spoke
as
coolly
of
his
long
lonely
journeys
as
possible
and
seemed
to
think
black
friends
quite
as
good
as
white
ones
the
use
of
the
words
and
by
a
woman
who
spoke
very
good
german
were
characteristic
she
could
recognise
an
of
berlin
i
need
not
say
that
the
germans
are
generally
liked
by
the
coloured
people
choslullah
was
astonished
and
pleased
at
my
talking
german
he
evidently
had
a
preference
for
germans
and
put
up
wherever
he
could
at
german
inns
and
i
went
on
to
bid
wodehouse
we
talked
of
our
dear
old
cornish
friends
the
governor
and
wodehouse
have
been
very
kind
to
me
i
dined
there
twice
last
time
with
all
the
dear
good
walkers
i
missed
seeing
the
opening
of
the
colonial
parliament
by
a
mistake
about
a
ticket
which
i
am
sorry
for
if
i
could
have
dreamed
of
waiting
here
so
long
i
would
have
run
up
to
algoa
bay
or
east
london
by
sea
and
had
a
glimpse
of
caffreland
capetown
makes
me
very
is
something
depressing
in
the
my
cough
is
much
better
i
walk
here
without
feeling
and
is
so
dear
and
somehow
nothing
is
worth
while
when
one
is
waiting
from
day
to
day
so
i
have
spent
more
money
than
when
i
was
most
amused
in
being
bored
drove
me
to
the
capetown
races
at
green
point
on
friday
as
races
they
were
but
a
little
cape
horse
ridden
by
a
hottentot
beat
the
english
crack
racer
ridden
by
a
english
jockey
in
an
unaccountable
way
twice
over
the
malays
are
passionately
fond
of
and
the
crowd
was
fully
half
malay
there
were
dozens
of
carts
crowded
with
the
women
in
petticoats
of
every
most
brilliant
colour
white
muslin
jackets
and
gold
daggers
in
their
great
coils
of
shining
black
hair
all
most
as
they
always
are
their
pleasure
is
driving
about
the
men
have
no
separate
amusements
every
spare
corner
in
the
cart
is
filled
by
the
little
soft
round
faces
of
the
quiet
children
who
seem
amused
and
happy
and
never
make
a
noise
or
have
the
fidgets
i
can
not
make
out
why
they
are
so
well
behaved
it
favours
theory
of
the
expediency
of
utter
spoiling
for
one
never
hears
any
educational
process
going
on
tiny
mohammed
never
spoke
but
when
he
was
spoken
to
and
was
always
happy
and
alert
i
observed
that
his
uncle
spoke
to
him
like
a
grown
man
and
never
ordered
him
about
or
rebuked
him
in
the
least
i
like
to
go
up
the
hill
and
meet
the
black
women
coming
home
in
troops
from
the
washing
place
most
of
them
with
a
fat
black
baby
hanging
to
their
backs
asleep
and
a
few
rather
older
trotting
alongside
and
if
small
holding
on
by
the
gown
she
poor
soul
carries
a
bundle
on
her
head
which
few
men
could
lift
if
i
admire
the
babies
the
poor
women
are
enchanted
if
you
look
at
blacks
of
any
age
or
sex
they
grin
and
nod
as
a
dog
must
wag
his
tail
they
help
it
the
blacks
here
except
a
very
few
caffres
are
from
the
short
ugly
race
with
wool
in
huge
masses
but
here
and
there
one
sees
a
very
pretty
face
among
the
women
the
men
are
beyond
belief
hideous
there
are
all
possible
mozambique
hottentot
and
english
then
here
and
there
you
see
that
a
chinese
or
a
bengalee
pass√©
par
the
malays
are
also
a
mixed
race
like
the
they
marry
women
of
all
sorts
and
colours
provided
they
will
embrace
islam
a
very
nice
old
fellow
who
waits
here
occasionally
is
married
to
an
englishwoman
to
a
wife
i
fancy
too
they
brought
some
chinese
blood
with
them
from
java
i
think
the
population
of
capetown
must
be
the
most
motley
crew
in
the
world
may
sail
on
saturday
and
go
on
board
so
as
not
to
be
hurried
off
in
the
early
fog
how
glad
i
am
to
be
at
last
i
can
not
say
i
am
very
well
and
have
every
prospect
of
a
pleasant
voyage
we
are
sure
to
be
well
found
as
the
is
on
board
and
is
a
very
great
man
terror
and
here
says
we
certainly
put
in
at
helena
so
make
up
your
minds
not
to
see
me
till
i
know
when
she
has
been
on
board
fitting
up
the
cabin
i
have
a
rug
for
a
mosaic
of
skins
as
fine
as
marqueterie
done
by
damara
women
and
really
beautiful
and
a
blanket
for
you
the
essence
of
warmth
and
softness
i
shall
sleep
in
mine
and
dream
of
african
wrapt
in
a
the
poor
little
have
been
killed
by
drought
and
i
get
any
but
i
have
the
two
of
my
own
catching
for
dearest
mother
you
would
have
been
moved
by
poor
old
abdool
solemn
benediction
when
i
took
leave
he
accompanied
it
with
a
gross
of
oranges
and
lemons
letter
xv
capetown
thursday
may
at
last
after
no
end
of
and
i
shall
sail
on
saturday
the
per
ship
for
east
india
docks
these
weary
six
weeks
have
cost
no
end
of
money
and
temper
i
have
been
eating
my
heart
out
at
the
delay
but
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
go
by
any
of
the
indian
ships
they
say
there
have
never
been
so
few
ships
sailing
from
the
cape
as
this
year
yet
crowds
were
expected
on
account
of
the
exhibition
the
goes
by
our
ship
so
we
are
sure
of
good
usage
and
i
hear
he
is
very
agreeable
i
have
the
best
cabin
next
to
the
stern
cabin
in
both
senses
of
has
come
back
from
the
ship
where
she
has
spent
the
day
with
the
carpenter
and
i
am
to
go
on
board
will
you
ask
to
cause
inquiries
to
be
made
among
the
mollahs
of
cairo
for
a
hadji
by
name
abdool
rachman
the
son
of
abdool
jemaalee
of
capetown
and
if
possible
to
get
the
inclosed
letter
sent
him
the
poor
people
are
in
sad
anxiety
for
their
son
of
whom
they
have
not
heard
for
four
months
and
that
from
an
old
letter
henry
will
thus
have
a
part
of
all
the
blessings
which
were
solemnly
invoked
on
me
by
poor
old
abdool
who
is
getting
very
infirm
but
toddled
up
and
cracked
his
old
fingers
over
my
head
and
invoked
the
protection
of
allah
with
all
form
besides
that
betsy
sent
me
twelve
dozen
oranges
and
lemons
abdool
rachman
is
about
a
malay
of
capetown
speaks
dutch
and
english
and
is
supposed
to
be
studying
theology
at
cairo
the
letter
is
written
by
the
prettiest
malay
girl
in
capetown
i
enter
upon
my
longings
to
be
home
again
and
to
see
you
all
i
must
now
see
to
my
last
commissions
and
things
and
send
this
to
go
by
next
mail
god
bless
you
all
and
kiss

letter
xvi
friday
may
on
board
the
good
ship
miles
of
i
embarked
this
day
week
and
found
a
good
airy
cabin
and
all
very
comfortable
next
day
i
got
the
services
by
being
on
board
before
all
the
rest
and
relashed
and
cleeted
everything
which
the
of
course
had
left
so
as
to
get
adrift
the
first
breeze
at
two
the
porter
came
on
board
escorted
by
bands
of
music
and
all
the
volunteers
of
capetown
pars
maxima
colonel
it
was
quite
what
the
yankees
call
an
the
ship
was
all
decked
with
flags
and
altogether
there
was
diable
√†
the
consequence
was
that
three
signals
went
adrift
in
the
scuffle
and
when
a
frenchman
signalled
us
we
had
to
pass
for
because
we
could
not
reply
i
found
means
to
supply
the
deficiency
by
the
lining
of
that
very
ancient
anonymous
cloak
which
did
the
red
while
a
bandanna
handkerchief
of
the
furnished
the
yellow
to
the
immense
amusement
on
him
i
bestowed
the
blue
outside
of
the
cloak
for
a
pair
of
dungaree
trowsers
and
in
signalling
now
it
is
go
and
my
cloak
which
is
we
have
had
lovely
weather
and
on
sunday
such
a
glorious
farewell
sight
of
table
mountain
and
my
dear
old
hottentot
hills
and
of
kaap
goed
hoop
itself
there
was
little
enough
wind
till
yesterday
when
a
fair
southerly
breeze
sprang
up
and
we
are
rolling
along
merrily
and
the
fat
old
roll
like
an
honest
old
tub
as
she
is
it
is
quite
a
for
me
to
have
been
forced
to
wait
for
her
for
we
have
had
a
wonderful
spell
of
fine
weather
and
the
ship
is
the
plus
of
comfort
we
are
only
twelve
passengers
the
captain
is
a
delightful
fellow
with
a
very
charming
young
wife
there
is
only
one
child
a
great
comfort
a
capital
cook
and
universal
civility
and
quietness
it
is
like
a
private
house
compared
to
a
railway
hotel
six
of
the
passengers
are
invalids
more
or
less
porter
going
home
for
health
to
ireland
two
men
both
with
delicate
chests
and
one
poor
young
fellow
from
capetown
in
a
consumption
who
i
fear
will
not
outlive
the
voyage
the
doctor
is
very
civil
and
very
kind
to
the
sick
but
i
stick
to
the
cook
and
am
quite
greedy
over
the
good
fare
after
the
atrocious
food
of
the
cape
said
cook
is
a
portuguese
a
distinguished
artist
and
a
great
one
can
wander
all
over
the
ship
here
instead
of
being
a
prisoner
on
the
poop
and
i
even
have
paid
my
footing
on
the
forecastle
clambers
up
like
a
lively
youngster
you
may
fancy
what
the
weather
is
that
i
have
only
closed
my
once
during
half
of
a
very
damp
night
but
no
one
else
is
so
airy
the
little
goat
was
as
rejoiced
to
be
afloat
again
as
her
mistress
and
is
a
regular
pet
on
board
with
the
run
of
the
she
still
gives
perfect
amalth√¶a
the
butcher
who
has
the
care
of
her
cockers
her
up
with
dainties
and
she
begs
biscuit
of
the
cook
i
pay
nothing
for
her
fare
tortoises
are
in
my
cabin
and
seem
very
happy
poor
porter
is
very
sick
and
so
are
the
two
or
three
coloured
passengers
who
an
at
all
the
wife
a
young
cape
lady
and
i
are
the
only
of
the
party
the
other
day
we
saw
a
shoal
of
porpoises
amounting
to
many
hundreds
if
not
some
thousands
who
came
frisking
round
the
ship
when
we
first
saw
them
they
looked
like
a
line
of
breakers
they
made
such
a
splash
and
they
jumped
right
out
of
the
water
three
feet
in
height
and
ten
or
twelve
in
distance
glittering
green
and
bronze
in
the
sun
such
a
pretty
merry
set
of
fellows
we
shall
touch
at
helena
where
i
shall
leave
this
letter
to
go
by
the
mail
steamer
that
you
may
know
a
few
weeks
before
i
arrive
how
comfortably
my
voyage
has
begun
we
see
no
cape
pigeons
they
only
visit
outward
not
that
strange
many
more
albatrosses
than
in
coming
and
we
also
enjoy
the
advantage
of
seeing
all
the
ships
as
they
all
humiliating
fact
the
captain
laughed
heartily
because
i
said
all
right
i
shall
have
the
more
sea
for
my
the
prospect
of
a
slow
voyage
was
discussed
it
is
very
provoking
to
be
so
much
longer
separated
from
you
all
than
i
had
hoped
but
i
really
believe
that
the
bad
air
and
discomfort
of
the
other
ships
would
have
done
me
serious
injury
while
here
i
have
every
chance
of
benefiting
to
the
utmost
and
having
mild
weather
the
whole
way
besides
the
utmost
amount
of
comfort
possible
on
board
ship
there
are
some
cockroaches
indeed
but
that
is
the
only
drawback
the
is
fourteen
years
old
and
was
the
crack
ship
to
india
in
her
day
now
she
takes
cargo
and
only
and
of
course
only
gets
invalids
and
people
who
care
more
for
comfort
than
speed
may
we
are
working
away
still
to
reach
helena
we
got
the
tail
of
a
terrific
gale
and
a
tremendous
sea
all
night
in
our
teeth
which
broke
up
the
trades
for
a
week
now
it
is
all
smooth
and
fair
with
a
light
breeze
again
right
aft
the
old
trade
again
yesterday
a
large
shark
paid
us
a
visit
with
his
suite
of
three
pretty
little
striped
like
zebras
who
swam
just
over
his
back
he
tried
on
a
cap
which
fell
overboard
tossed
it
away
contemptuously
snuffed
at
the
fat
pork
with
which
a
hook
was
baited
and
would
none
of
it
and
finally
ate
the
fresh
which
the
butcher
had
in
tow
to
clean
it
previous
to
putting
it
away
as
a
perquisite
it
is
a
beautiful
fish
in
shape
and
very
graceful
in
motion
a
barque
from
algoa
bay
came
close
to
us
and
talked
with
the
speaking
trumpet
she
was
a
pretty
craft
but
had
made
a
slower
run
even
than
ourselves
i
dare
say
we
shall
have
her
company
for
a
long
time
as
she
is
bound
for
helena
and
london
my
poor
goat
died
suddenly
the
other
day
to
the
general
grief
of
the
ship
also
one
of
the
tortoises
the
poor
consumptive
lad
is
wonderfully
better
but
all
the
passengers
were
very
sick
during
the
rough
weather
except
and
i
who
are
quite
old
salts
last
week
we
saw
a
young
whale
a
baby
about
thirty
feet
long
and
had
a
good
view
of
him
as
he
played
round
the
ship
we
shall
probably
be
at
helena
on
wednesday
but
i
can
not
write
from
thence
as
if
there
is
time
i
shall
get
a
run
on
shore
while
the
ship
takes
in
water
but
this
letter
will
tell
you
of
my
so
far
and
in
about
six
weeks
after
the
date
of
it
i
hope
to
be
with
you
i
hope
you
expect
too
much
in
the
way
of
improvement
in
my
health
i
look
forward
oh
so
eagerly
to
be
with
you
again
and
with
my
brats
big
and
little
god
bless
you
all
yours
ever
morning
off
helena
james

such
a
lovely
view
of
