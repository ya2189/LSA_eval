preface
this
book
was
written
primarily
for
students
of
forestry
to
whom
a
knowledge
of
the
technical
properties
of
wood
is
essential
the
mechanics
involved
is
reduced
to
the
simplest
terms
and
without
reference
to
higher
mathematics
with
which
the
students
rarely
are
familiar
the
intention
throughout
has
been
to
avoid
all
unnecessarily
technical
language
and
descriptions
thereby
making
the
readily
available
to
every
one
interested
in
wood
part
i
is
devoted
to
a
discussion
of
the
mechanical
properties
of
wood
the
relation
of
wood
material
to
stresses
and
strains
much
of
the
is
merely
elementary
mechanics
of
materials
in
general
though
written
with
reference
to
wood
in
particular
numerous
tables
are
included
showing
the
various
strength
values
of
many
of
the
more
important
american
woods
part
ii
deals
with
the
factors
affecting
the
mechanical
properties
of
wood
this
is
a
subject
of
interest
to
all
who
are
concerned
in
the
rational
use
of
wood
and
to
the
forester
it
also
by
retrospection
suggests
ways
and
means
of
regulating
his
forest
product
through
control
of
the
conditions
of
production
attempt
has
been
made
in
the
light
of
all
data
at
hand
to
answer
many
moot
questions
such
as
the
effect
on
the
quality
of
wood
of
rate
of

season
of

heartwood
and

describes
methods
of
timber
testing
they
are
for
the
most
part
those
followed
by
the
forest
service
in
schools
equipped
with
the
necessary
machinery
the
instructions
will
serve
to
direct
the
tests
in
others
a
study
of
the
text
with
reference
to
the
illustrations
should
give
an
adequate
conception
of
the
methods
employed
in
this
most
important
line
of
research
the
appendix
contains
a
copy
of
the
working
plan
followed
by
the
forest
service
in
the
extensive
investigations
covering
the
mechanical
properties
of
the
woods
grown
in
the
united
states
it
contains
many
valuable
suggestions
for
the
independent
investigator
in
addition
four
tables
of
strength
values
for
structural
timbers
both
green
and
are
included
the
relation
of
the
stresses
developed
in
different
structural
forms
to
those
developed
in
the
small
clear

is
given
in
the
bibliography
attempt
was
made
to
list
all
of
the
important
publications
and
articles
on
the
mechanical
properties
of
wood
and
timber
testing
while
admittedly
incomplete
it
should
prove
of
assistance
to
the
student
who
desires
a
fuller
knowledge
of
the
subject
than
is
presented
here
the
writer
is
indebted
to
the
forest
service
for
nearly
all
of
his
tables
and
photographs
as
well
as
many
of
the
data
upon
which
the
book
is
based
since
only
the
government
is
able
to
conduct
the
extensive
investigations
essential
to
a
thorough
understanding
of
the
subject
more
than
eighty
thousand
tests
have
been
made
at
the
madison
laboratory
alone
and
the
work
is
far
from
completion
the
writer
also

the
mechanical
properties
of
wood
introduction
the
mechanical
properties
of
wood
are
its
fitness
and
ability
to
resist
applied
or
external
forces
by
external
force
is
meant
any
force
outside
of
a
given
piece
of
material
which
tends
to
deform
it
in
any
manner
it
is
largely
such
properties
that
determine
the
use
of
wood
for
structural
and
building
purposes
and
innumerable
other
uses
of
which
furniture
vehicles
implements
and
tool
handles
are
a
few
common
examples
knowledge
of
these
properties
is
obtained
through
experimentation
either
in
the
employment
of
the
wood
in
practice
or
by
means
of
special
testing
apparatus
in
the
laboratory
owing
to
the
wide
range
of
variation
in
wood
it
is
necessary
that
a
great
number
of
tests
be
made
and
that
so
far
as
possible
all
disturbing
factors
be
eliminated
for
comparison
of
different
kinds
or
sizes
a
standard
method
of
testing
is
necessary
and
the
values
must
be
expressed
in
some
defined
units
for
these
reasons
laboratory
experiments
if
properly
conducted
have
many
advantages
over
any
other
method
one
object
of
such
investigation
is
to
find
unit
values
for
strength
and
stiffness
etc
these
because
of
the
complex
structure
of
wood
can
not
have
a
constant
value
which
will
be
exactly
repeated
in
each
test
even
though
no
error
be
made
the
most
that
can
be
accomplished
is
to
find
average
values
the
amount
of
variation
above
and
below
and
the
laws
which
govern
the
variation
on
account
of
the
great
variability
in
strength
of
different
specimens
of
wood
even
from
the
same
stick
and
appearing
to
be
alike
it
is
important
to
eliminate
as
far
as
possible
all
extraneous
factors
liable
to
influence
the
results
of
the
tests
the
mechanical
properties
of
wood
considered
in
this
book
are
stiffness
and
elasticity
tensile
strength
compressive
or
crushing
strength
shearing
strength
transverse
or
bending
strength
toughness
hardness
cleavability
resilience
in
connection
with
these
associated
properties
of
importance
are
briefly
treated
in
making
use
of
figures
indicating
the
strength
or
other
mechanical
properties
of
wood
for
the
purpose
of
comparing
the
relative
merits
of
different
species
the
fact
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
there
is
a
considerable
range
in
variability
of
each
individual
material
and
that
small
differences
such
as
a
few
hundred
pounds
in
values
of
pounds
can
not
be
considered
as
a
criterion
of
the
quality
of
the
timber
in
testing
material
of
the
same
kind
and
grade
differences
of
per
cent
between
individual
specimens
may
be
expected
in
conifers
and
per
cent
or
even
more
in
hardwoods
the
figures
given
in
the
tables
should
be
taken
as
indications
rather
than
fixed
values
and
as
applicable
to
a
large
number
collectively
and
not
to
individual
pieces
fundamental
considerations
and
definitions
study
of
the
mechanical
properties
of
a
material
is
concerned
mostly
with
its
behavior
in
relation
to
stresses
and
strains
and
the
factors
affecting
this
behavior
a
is
a
distributed
force
and
may
be
defined
as
the
mutual
action
of
one
body
upon
another
or
of
one
part
of
a
body
upon
another
part
in
the
first
case
the
stress
is
in
the
other
the
same
stress
may
be
internal
from
one
point
of
view
and
external
from
another
an
external
force
is
always
balanced
by
the
internal
stresses
when
the
body
is
in
equilibrium
if
no
external
forces
act
upon
a
body
its
particles
assume
certain
relative
positions
and
it
has
what
is
called
its
shape
and
if
sufficient
external
force
is
applied
the
natural
shape
and
size
will
be
changed
this
distortion
or
deformation
of
the
material
is
known
as
the
every
stress
produces
a
corresponding
strain
and
within
a
certain
limit
see
in
fundamental
considerations
and
definitions
above
the
strain
is
directly
proportional
to
the
stress
producing
it
the
same
intensity
of
stress
however
does
not
produce
the
same
strain
in
different
materials
or
in
different
qualities
of
the
same
material
no
strain
would
be
produced
in
a
perfectly
rigid
body
but
such
is
not
known
to
exist
footnote
this
is
in
accordance
with
the
discovery
made
in
by
robert
hooke
and
is
known
as
stress
is
measured
in
pounds
or
other
unit
of
weight
or
force
a
is
the
stress
on
a
unit
of
the
sectional
p
area
unit
stress
for
instance
if
a
load
p
of
one
a
hundred
pounds
is
uniformly
supported
by
a
vertical
post
with
a
area
a
of
ten
square
inches
the
unit
compressive
stress
is
ten
pounds
per
square
inch
strain
is
measured
in
inches
or
other
linear
unit
a
is
the
strain
per
unit
of
length
thus
if
a
post
inches
long
before
compression
is
inches
long
under
the
compressive
stress
the
total
strain
is
inch
and
the
unit
l
strain
is
inch
per
inch
of
length
l
as
the
stress
increases
there
is
a
corresponding
increase
in
the
strain
this
ratio
may
be
graphically
shown
by
means
of
a
diagram
or
curve
plotted
with
the
increments
of
load
or
stress
as
ordinates
and
the
increments
of
strain
as
abscissæ
this
is
known
as
the
within
the
limit
mentioned
above
the
diagram
is
a
straight
line
see
fig
if
the
results
of
similar
experiments
on
different
specimens
are
plotted
to
the
same
scales
the
diagrams
furnish
a
ready
means
for
comparison
the
greater
the
resistance
a
material
offers
to

the
steeper
or

will
be

of

respectively
there
are
three
kinds
of
internal
stresses
namely
and
when
external
forces
act
upon
a
bar
in
a
direction
away
from
its
ends
or
a

the
stress
is
a

stress
when
toward

or
a
direct
push
compressive
stress
in
the
first
instance
the
strain
is
an
in
the
second
a
whenever
the
forces
tend
to
cause
one
portion
of
the
material
to
slide
upon
another
adjacent
to
it
the
action
is
called
a
the
action
is
that
of
an
ordinary
pair
of
shears
when
riveted
plates
slide
on
each
other
the
rivets
are
sheared
off
these
three
simple
stresses
may
act
together
producing
compound
stresses
as
in
flexure
when
a
bow
is
bent
there
is
a
compression
of
the
fibres
on
the
inner
or
concave
side
and
an
elongation
of
the
fibres
on
the
outer
or
convex
side
there
is
also
a
tendency
of
the
various
fibres
to
slide
past
one
another
in
a
longitudinal
direction
if
the
bow
were
made
of
two
or
more
separate
pieces
of
equal
length
it
would
be
noted
on
bending
that
slipping
occurred
along
the
surfaces
of

the

just

the

by
means
of
which
a
body
acted
upon
by
external
forces
tends
to
retain
its
natural
size
and

or

deformation
thus
a
material
that

difficult
to
bend

otherwise
deform
is
stiff
one
that
is
easily
bent
or
otherwise
deformed
is
flexibility
is
not
the
exact
counterpart
of
stiffness
as
it
also
involves
toughness
and
pliability
if
successively
larger
loads
are
applied
to
a
body
and
then
removed
it
will
be
found
that
at
first
the
body
completely
regains
its

the

so
under
small

eventually
a
point
will
be
reached
where
the

of
the

is

this
point
is
known
as
the
which
may
be
defined
as
the
limit
beyond
which
it
is
impossible
to
carry

of

without
producing
a
permanent
alteration
in

after
this

has
been
exceeded
the
size
and
shape
of
the
specimen
after
removal
of
the

will
not
be
the

as
before
and
the
difference
or
amount
of
change
is
known
as
the
elastic

as
measured
in

and
used
in

may
be
defined
as
that

at
which
the

the

perhaps
the
best

of
the

quality
though
it

not
synonymous
with

permanent

the
of

a

lead

moist
clay
are
nearly
plastic
and
wood
possesses
this
property
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
the
plasticity
of
wood
is
increased
by
wetting
heating
and
especially
by
steaming
and
boiling
were
it
not
for
this
property
it
would
be
impossible
to
dry
wood
without
destroying
completely
its
cohesion
due
to
the
irregularity
of
shrinkage
a
substance
that
can
undergo
little
change
in
shape
without
breaking
or
rupturing
is
chalk
and
glass
are
common
examples
of
brittle
materials
sometimes
the
word
is
used
to
describe
this
condition
in
wood
a
brittle
wood
breaks
suddenly
with
a
clean
instead
of
a
splintery
fracture
and
without
warning
such
woods
are
unfitted
to
resist
shock
or
sudden
application
of

the
measure
of
the
stiffness
of
wood
is
termed
the
of

of

is
the
ratio
of

a

stiffness
not

within

it
is
nearly
the

whether
derived
from
compression
tests
or
from

a
large

indicates

thus
in

results
when
a

force
is
applied
to
opposite
ends
of
a
body
this
external
pull
is
communicated
to
the
interior
so
that
any
portion
of
the
material
exerts
a
pull
or
tensile
force
upon
the
remainder
the
ability
to
do
so
depending
upon
the
property
of
cohesion
the
result
is
an
elongation
or
stretching
of
the
material
in
the
direction
of
the
applied
force
the
action
is
the
opposite
of
compression
wood
exhibits
its
greatest
strength
in
tension
parallel
to
the
grain
and
it
is
very
uncommon
in
practice
for
a
specimen
to
be
pulled
in
two
lengthwise
this
is
due
to
the
difficulty
of
making
the
end
fastenings
secure
enough
for
the
full
tensile
strength
to
be
brought
into
play
before
the
fastenings
shear
off
longitudinally
this
is
not
the
case
with
metals
and
as
a
result
they
are
used
in
almost
all
places
where
tensile
strength
is
particularly
needed
even
though
the
remainder
of
the
structure
such
as
sills
beams
joists
posts
and
flooring
may
be
of
wood
thus
in
a
wooden
truss
bridge
the
tension
members
are
steel
rods
the
tensile
strength
of
wood
parallel
to
the

depends
upon
the
strength
of
the
fibres
and
is
affected
not
only
by
the
nature
and
dimensions
of
the
wood
elements
but
also
by
their
arrangement
it
is

in

effect
of

across
the

is
to
compact
the
fibres
the
load
gradually
but
irregularly
increasing
as
the
density
of
the
material
is
increased
if
the
specimen
lies
on

see

the
irregularities
in

are
due
to

fact
that
the

collapse
a
few
at

the
projection
of

increases
the
strength
of
the
material

beneath

its

this

explained
on

that
the

by

might

in

imposition
of

without

thus
in
the
case
of
placing
a
load
on
a
beam
if
the
load
be
brought
into
contact
with
the
beam
but
its
weight
sustained
by
external
means
as
by
a
cord
and
then
this
external
support
be
instantaneously
removed
as
by
quickly
cutting
the
cord
then
although
the
load
is
already
touching
the
beam
and
hence
there
is
no
real
impact
yet
the
beam
is
at
first
offering
no
resistance
as
it
has
yet
suffered
no
deformation
furthermore
as
the
beam
deflects
the
resistance
increases
but
does
not
come
to
be
equal
to
the
load
until
it
has
attained
its
normal
deflection
in
the
meantime
there
has
been
an
unbalanced
force
of
gravity
acting
of
a
constantly
diminishing
amount
equal
at
first
to
the
entire
load
at
the
normal
deflection
but
at
this
instant
the
load
and
the
beam
are
in
motion
the
hitherto
unbalanced
force
having
produced
an
accelerated
velocity
and
this
velocity
of
the
weight
and
beam
gives
to
them
an
energy
or
which
must
now
spend
itself
in
overcoming
an
of
resistance
over
and
above
the
imposed
load
and
the
whole
mass
will
not
stop
until
the
deflection
as
well
as
the
resistance
has
come
to
be
equal
to
that
corresponding
to
the
static
load
imposed
hence
we
say
the
effect
of
a
suddenly
imposed
load
is
to
produce
twice
the
deflection
and
stress
of
the
same
load
statically
applied
it
must
be
evident
however
that
this
case
has
nothing
in
common
with

of

great
that

as
in

a
common
method
of

to

complicated
by
the
fact
that
there
are
various
ways
in

it
produces
a
local

of

in

the
compression
of
the
substance
of

may
be
neglected
since
the

is
very
hard
in
comparison
with
the
wood
in
addition
to
the
compression
of

at

offered
by

at

often
entirely
out
of

to
the
compression

would
result
from
the
action
of
a
static

of
the
same
magnitude
it
frequently
exceeds
the

at

sense
that
is
for

the
ability

woods

treatment
yet
this
test
is
one
of
the
most
important
made
on
wood
as
it
brings
out
properties
not
evident
from
other
tests
defects
and
brittleness
are
revealed
by
impact
better
than
by
any
other
kind
of

all
external
stresses
are
of
the
nature
of
impact
in
fact
no
two
moving
bodies
can
come
together
without
impact
stress
impact
is
therefore
the
commonest
form
of
applied
stress
although
the
most
difficult
to
measure
in
timber
if
a
beam
is
loaded
too
heavily
it
will
break
or
fail
in
some
characteristic
manner
these
failures
may
be
classified
according
to
the
way
in
which
they
develop
as
tension
compression
and
horizontal
shear
and
according
to
the
appearance
of
the
broken
surface
as
brash
and
fibrous
a
number
of
forms
may
develop
if
the
beam
is
completely
ruptured
since
the
tensile
strength
of
wood
is
on
the
average
about
three
times
as
great
as
the
compressive
strength
a
beam
should
therefore
be
expected
to
fail
by
the
formation
in
the
first
place
of
a
fold
on
the
compression
side
due
to
the
crushing
action
followed
by
failure
on
the
tension
side
this
is
usually
the
case
in
green
or
moist
wood
in
dry
material
the
first
visible
failure
is
not
infrequently
on
the
lower
or
tension
side
and
various
attempts
have
been
made
to
explain
why
such
is
the
case

may
occur
partially
in

bundles

some
time
before
the
final
failure
takes
place
one
reason
why
the
failure
of
a
dry
beam
is
different
from
one
that
is
moist
is
that
drying
increases
the
stiffness
of
the
fibres
so
that
they
offer
more
resistance
to
crushing
while
it
has
much
less
effect
upon
the
tensile
strength
there
is
considerable
variation
in
tension
failures
depending
upon
the
toughness

the
brittleness
of
the
wood
the
arrangement
of
the
grain
defects
making
further
classification
desirable
the
four
most
common
forms
are
tension
in
which
there
is
a
direct
pulling
in

of
the
wood

under
side

a
tensile
stress

common
form

toughness
torsion
toughness
is
a
term
applied
to
more
than
one
property
of
wood
thus
wood
that
is
difficult
to
split
is
said
to
be
tough
again
a
tough
wood
is
one
that
will
not
rupture
until
it
has
deformed
considerably
under
loads
at
or
near
its
maximum
strength
or
one
which
still
hangs
together
after
it
has
been
ruptured
and
may
be
bent
back
and
forth
without
breaking
apart
toughness
includes
flexibility
and
is
the
reverse
of
brittleness
in
that
tough
woods
break
gradually
and
give
warning
of
failure
tough
woods
offer
great
resistance
to
impact
and
will
permit
rougher
treatment
in
manipulations
attending
manufacture
and
use
toughness
is
dependent
upon
the
strength
cohesion
quality
length
and
arrangement
of
fibre
and
the
pliability
of
the
wood
coniferous
woods
as
a
rule
are
not
as
tough
as
hardwoods
of
which
hickory
and
elm
are
the
best
examples
the
torsion
or
twisting
test
is
useful
in
determining
the
toughness
of
wood
if
the
ends
of
a
shaft
are
turned
in
opposite
directions
or
one
end
is
turned
and
the
other
is
fixed
all
of
the
fibres
except
those
at
the
axis
tend
to
assume
the
form
of
helices
see

the
strain
produced
by
torsion
or
twisting
is
essentially
shear
transverse
and
parallel
to
the
fibres
combined
with
longitudinal
tension
and
transverse
compression
within
the
elastic
limit
the
strains
increase
directly
as
the
distance
from
the
axis
of
the
specimen
the
outer
elements
are
subjected
to
tensile
stresses
and
as
they
become
twisted
tend
to
compress
those
near
the
axis
the
elongated
elements
also
contract
laterally
cross
sections
which
were
originally
plane
become
warped
with
increasing
strain
the
lateral
adhesion
of
the
outer
fibres
is
destroyed
allowing
them
to
slide
past
each
other
and
reducing
greatly
their
power
of
resistance
in
this
way
the
strains
on
the
fibres
nearer
the
axis
are
progressively
increased
until
finally
all
of
the
elements
are
sheared
apart
it
is
only
in
the
toughest
materials
that
the
full

of
this
action

hardness
the
term
is
used
in
two
senses
namely
resistance
to
indentation
and
resistance
to
abrasion
or
scratching
in
the
latter
sense
hardness
combined
with
toughness
is
a
measure
of
the
wearing
ability
of
wood
and
is
an
important
consideration
in
the
use
of
wood
for
floors
paving
blocks
bearings
and
rollers
while
resistance
to
indentation
is
dependent
mostly
upon
the
density
of
the
wood
the
wearing
qualities
may
be
governed
by
other
factors
such
as
toughness
and
the
size
cohesion
and
arrangement
of
the
fibres
in
use
for
floors
some
woods
tend
to
compact
and
wear
smooth
while
others
become
splintery
and
rough
this
feature
is
affected
to
some
extent
by
the
manner
in
which
the
wood
is
sawed
thus
pine

is
much
better

cleavability

the
term
used
to
denote
the
facility
with

this
property
of
wood
is
very
important
in
certain
uses
such
as
firewood
fence
rails
billets
and

resistance
to
splitting
or
low
cleavability
is
desirable
where

must
hold

splits
more
readily
along
the
radius
than
parallel
to
the

rings
though
exceptions
occur
as
in
the
case
of

grain
splitting
involves
transverse
tension
but
only
a

of
the
fibres
are
under
stress
at
a
time
a
wood
of
little
stiffness
and
strong
cohesion
across
the

is
difficult
to
split
while
one
with
great
stiffness
such
as
longleaf
pine
is
easily
split
the
form

and
the

factors
affecting
the

properties
of
wood
introduction
wood
is
an
organic
product
a
structure
of
infinite
variation
of
detail
and
design
it
is
on
this
account
that
no
two
woods
are
alike
in
reality
no
two
specimens
from
the
same
log
are
identical
there
are
certain
properties
that
characterize
each
species
but
they
are
subject
to
considerable
variation
oak
for
example
is
considered
hard
heavy
and
strong
but
some
pieces
even
of
the
same
species
of
oak
are
much
harder
heavier
and
stronger
than
others
with
hickory
are
associated
the
properties
of
great
strength
toughness
and
resilience
but
some
pieces
are
comparatively
weak
and
brash
and
for
the
exacting
demands
for
which
good
hickory
is
peculiarly
adapted

it
follows
that
no

can
be
assigned
to
the

of
any

that

with

knowledge
of

it
becomes
possible
to
infer
from
the

its
probable

from
the

as
yet
too
little
is

rate
of
growth
to
understand
the
effect
of
variations
in
the
rate
of
growth
it
is
first
necessary
to
know
how
wood
is
formed
a
tree
increases
in
diameter
by
the
formation
between
the
old
wood
and
the
inner
bark
of
new
woody
layers
which
envelop
the
entire
stem
living
branches
and
roots
under
ordinary
conditions
one
layer
is
formed
each
year
and
in
cross
section
as
on
the
end
of
a
log
they
appear
as
rings
often
spoken
of
as
these
growth
layers
are
made
up
of
wood
cells
of
various
kinds
but
for
the
most
part
fibrous
in
timbers
like
pine
spruce
hemlock
and
other
coniferous
or
softwood
species
the
wood
cells
are
mostly
of
one
kind
and
as
a
result
the
material
is
much
more
uniform
in
structure
than
that
of
most
hardwoods
see

there
are
no
vessels

in

into
two
large
classes
and
see
fig
in

such
as
oak

the
larger
vessels

pores
as
cross
sections
of
vessels
are
called
become
localized
in
one
part
of
the
growth
ring
thus
forming
a
region
of
more
or
less
open
and
porous
tissue
the
rest
of
the
ring
is
made
up
of
smaller
vessels
and
a
much
greater
proportion
of
wood
fibres
these
fibres
are
the
elements
which
give
strength
and
toughness
to
wood
while
the
vessels
are
a
source
of
weakness
in
woods
the
pores
are
scattered
throughout
the
growth
ring
instead
of
being
collected
in
a
band
or
row
examples
of
this
kind
of
wood
are

some
species
such
as
walnut
and
cherry
are
on
the
border
between
the
two
classes
forming
a
sort
of
intermediate
group
if
one
examines
the
smoothly
cut
end
of
a
stick
of
almost
any
kind
of
wood
he
will
note
that
each
growth
ring
is
made
up
of
two
more
or
less
parts
that
originally
nearest
the
centre
of
the
tree
is
more
open
textured
and
almost
invariably
lighter
in
color
than
that
near
the
outer
portion
of
the
ring
the
inner
portion
was
formed
early
in
the
season
when
growth
was
comparatively
rapid
and
is
known
as
also
spring
wood
the
outer
portion
is
the
being
produced
in
the
summer
or
early
fall
in
soft
pines
there
is
not
much
contrast
in
the
different
parts
of
the
ring
and
as
a
result
the
wood
is
very
uniform
in
texture
and
is
easy
to
work
in
hard
pine
on
the
other
hand
the
late
wood
is
very
dense
and
is
presenting
a
very
decided
contrast
to
the
soft
early
wood
see
fig
in

each
season
growth
is
always
well
defined
because
the
large
pores
of
the
spring
abut
on
the
denser
tissue
of
the
fall
before
in
the
the
demarcation
between
rings
is
not

in
not
a

if
one
compares
a
heavy
piece
of
pine
with
a
light
specimen
it
will
be
seen
at
once
that
the
heavier
one
contains
a
larger
proportion
of
late
wood
than
the
other
and
is
therefore
considerably
darker
the
late
wood
of
all
species
is
denser
than
that
formed
early
in
the
season
hence
the
greater
the
proportion
of
late
wood
the
greater
the
density
and
strength
when
examined
under
a
microscope
the
cells
of
the
late
wood
are
seen
to
be
very
and
with
very
small
cavities
while
those
formed
first
in
the
season
have
thin
walls
and
large
cavities
the
strength
is
in
the
walls
not
the

in
choosing
a
piece
of
pine
where
strength
or
stiffness
is
the
important
consideration
the
principal
thing
to
observe
is
the
comparative
amounts
of
early

late
wood
the
width
of
ring
that
is
the
number
per
inch
is
not
nearly
so
important
as
the
proportion
of
the
late
wood
in
the
ring
it
is
not
only
the
proportion
of
late
wood
but
also
its
quality
that
counts
in
specimens
that
show
a
very
large
proportion
of
late
wood
it
may
be
noticeably
more
porous
and
weigh
considerably
less
than
the
late
wood
in
pieces
that
contain
but
little
one
can
judge
comparative
density
and
therefore
to
some
extent
weight
and
strength
by
visual
inspection
the
conclusions
of
the
forest
service
regarding
the
effect
of
rate
of
growth
on
the
properties
of
douglas
fir
are
summarized
as
follows
in
general
rapidly
grown
wood
less
than
eight
rings
per
inch
is
relatively
weak
a
study
of
the
individual
tests
upon
which
the
average
points
are
based
shows
however
that
when
it
is
not
associated
with
light
weight
and
a
small
proportion
of
summer
wood
rapid
growth
is
not
indicative
of
weak
wood
an
average
rate
of
growth
indicated
by
from
to
rings
per
inch
seems
to
produce
the
best
material
in
rates
of
growths
lower
than
rings
per
inch
the
average
strength
of
the
material
decreases
apparently
approaching
a
uniform
condition
above
rings
per
inch
in
such
slow
rates
of
growth
the
texture
of
the
wood
is
very
uniform
and
naturally
there
is
little
variation
in
weight
or
strength
an
analysis
of
tests
on
large
beams
was
made
to
ascertain
if
average
rate
of
growth
has
any
relation
to
the
mechanical
properties
of
the
beams
the
analysis
indicated
conclusively
that
there
was
no
such
relation
average
rate
of
growth
without
consideration
also
of
density
therefore
has
little
significance
in
grading
structural
timber
this
is

no

can
as

be
given
for
the
real
causes
underlying
the
formation
of
early
and
late
wood
several
factors
may
be
involved
in
conifers
at
least
rate
of
growth
alone
does
not
determine
the
proportion
of
the
two
portions
of
the
ring
for
in
some
cases
the
wood
of
slow
growth
is
very
hard
and
heavy
while
in
others
the
opposite
is
true
the
quality
of
the
site
where
the
tree
grows
undoubtedly
affects
the
character
of
the
wood
formed
though
it
is
not
possible
to
formulate
a
rule
governing
it
in
general
however
it
may
be
said
that
where
strength
or
ease
of
working
is
essential
woods
of
moderate
to
slow
growth
should
be
chosen
but
in
choosing
a
particular
specimen
it
is
not
the
width
of
ring
but
the
proportion
and
character
of
the
late
wood
which
should
govern
in
the
case
of
the
hardwoods
there
seems
to
exist
a
pretty
definite
relation
between
the
rate
of
growth
of
timber
and
its
properties
this
may
be
briefly
summed
up
in
the
general
statement
that
the
more
rapid
the
growth
or
the
wider
the
rings
of
growth
the
heavier
harder
stronger
and
stiffer
the
wood
this
it
must
be
remembered
applies

to

such
as
oak
ash
hickory
and
others
of
the

wood

called
because
the
growth

young
timber
in

after
the
old
trees
have
been
removed
is
more
rapid
than
in
trees
in
the
forest
and
in
the
manufacture
of
articles
where
strength
is
an
important
consideration
such
hardwood
material
is
preferred
this
is
particularly
the
case
in
the
choice
of
hickory
for
handles
and

here
not
only
strength
but
toughness
and
resilience
are
important
the
results
of
a

of

that
the
work

ability
is
greatest
in
wood
that
has
from
to
rings
per
inch
is
fairly
constant
from
to
rings
and
decreases
rapidly
from
to
rings
the
strength
at
maximum
load
is
not
so
great
with
the
most
wood
it
is
maximum
with
from
to
rings
per
inch
and
again
becomes
less
as
the
wood
becomes
more
closely
ringed
the
natural
deduction
is
that
wood
of
mechanical
value
shows
from
to
rings
per
inch
and
that
slower
growth
yields
poorer
stock
thus
the
inspector
or
buyer
of
hickory
should
discriminate
against
timber
that
has
more
than
rings

exceptions
exist
however

by

as
follows
when

changes

little
with

that
the

broadening
of

is
always
at
the
expense

the
narrow

therefore

have
more

agrees

are
to
conduct

an
inner

becomes
inactive

ceases
to
function
this
inert
or
dead
portion
is
called
heartwood
deriving
its
name
solely
from
its
position
and
not
from
any
vital
importance
to
the
tree
as
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
a
tree
can
thrive
with
its

decayed

to
form
heartwood
very
early
in

in

thick
sapwood
is
the
rule
there
is
no
definite
relation
between
the
annual
rings
of
growth
and
the
amount
of
sapwood
within
the
same
species
the
area
of
the
sapwood
is
roughly
proportional
to
the
size
of
the
crown
of
the
tree
if
the
rings
are
narrow
more
of
them
are
required
than
where
they
are
wide
as
the
tree
gets
larger
the
sapwood
must
necessarily
become
thinner
or
increase
materially
in
volume
sapwood
is
thicker
in
the
upper
portion
of
the
trunk
of
a
tree
than
near
the
base
because
the
age
and
the
diameter
of
the
upper
sections
are
less
when
a
tree
is
very
young
it
is
covered
with
limbs
almost
if
not
entirely
to
the
ground
but
as
it
grows
older
some
or
all
of
them
will
eventually
die
and
be
broken
off
subsequent
growth
of
wood
may
completely
conceal
the
stubs
which
however
will
remain
as
knots
no
matter
how
smooth
and
clear
a
log
is
on
the
outside
it
is
more
or
less
knotty
near
the
middle
consequently
the
sapwood
of
an
old
tree
and
particularly
of
a
tree
will
be
freer
from
knots
than
the
heartwood
since
in
most
uses
of
wood
knots
are
defects
that
weaken
the
timber
and
interfere
with
its
ease
of
working
and
other
properties
it
follows
that
sapwood
because
of
its
position
in
the
tree
may
have
certain
advantages
over
heartwood
it
is
really
remarkable
that
the
inner
heartwood
of
old
trees
remains
as
sound
as
it
usually
does
since
in
many
cases
it
is
hundreds
of
years
and
in
a
few
instances
thousands
of
years
old
every
broken
limb
or
root
or
deep
wound
from
fire
insects
or
falling
timber
may
afford
an
entrance
for
decay
which
once
started
may
penetrate
to
all
parts
of
the
trunk
the
larvæ
of
many
insects
bore
into
the
trees
and
their
tunnels
remain
indefinitely
as
sources
of
weakness
whatever
advantages
however
that
sapwood
may
have
in
this
connection
are
due
solely
to
its
relative
age
and
position
if
a
tree
grows
all
its
life
in
the
open
and
the
conditions
of
soil
and
site
remain
unchanged
it
will
make
its
most
rapid
growth
in
youth
and
gradually
decline
the
annual
rings
of
growth
are
for
many
years
quite
wide
but
later
they
become
narrower
and
narrower
since
each
succeeding
ring
is
laid
down
on
the
outside
of
the
wood
previously
formed
it
follows
that
unless
a
tree
materially
increases
its
production
of
wood
from
year
to
year
the
rings
must
necessarily
become
thinner
as
a
tree
reaches
maturity
its
crown
becomes
more
open
and
the
annual
wood
production
is
lessened
thereby
reducing
still
more
the
width
of
the
growth
rings
in
the
case
of
trees
so
much
depends
upon
the
competition
of
the
trees
in
their
struggle
for
light
and
nourishment
that
periods
of
rapid
and
slow
growth
may
alternate
some
trees
such
as
southern
oaks
maintain
the
same
width
of
ring
for
hundreds
of
years
upon
the
whole
however
as
a
tree
gets
larger
in
diameter
the
width
of
the
growth
rings
decreases
it
is
evident
that
there
may
be
decided
differences
in
the
grain
of
heartwood
and
sapwood
cut
from
a
large
tree

one
that
is

stated
that

rule
the
wood
laid
on
late
in
the
life
of
a

is
softer
lighter
weaker
and
more
than
that
produced
earlier
it
follows
that
in
a
large
log
the
sapwood
because
of
the
time
in
the
life
of
the
tree
when
it
was
grown
may
be
inferior
in
hardness
strength
and
toughness
to
equally
sound
heartwood

tests
on
a

the

as

sapwood

go

it

it

cross
grain
is
a
very
common
defect
in
timber
one
form
of
it
is
produced
in
lumber
by
the
method
of
sawing
and
has
no
reference
to
the
natural
arrangement
of
the
wood
elements
thus
if
the
plane
of
the
saw
is
not
approximately
parallel
to
the
axis
of
the
log
the
grain
of
the
lumber
cut
is
not
parallel
to
the
edges
and
is
termed
diagonal
this
is
likely
to
occur
where
the
logs
have
considerable
taper
and
in
this
case
may
be
produced
if
sawed
parallel
to
the
axis
of
growth
instead
of
parallel
to
the
growth
rings
lumber
and
timber
with
diagonal
grain
is
always
weaker
than
material
the
extent
of
the
defect
varying
with
the
degree
of
the
angle
the
fibres
make
with
the
axis
of
the
stick
in
the
vicinity
of
large
knots
the
grain
is
likely
to
be
cross
the
defect
is
most
serious
where
wood
is
subjected
to
flexure
as
in
beams
is
a
very
common
defect
in
a
tree
and
when
excessive
renders
the
timber
valueless
for
use
except
in
the
round
it
is
produced
by
the
arrangement
of
the
wood
fibres
in
a
spiral
direction
about
the
axis
instead
of
exactly
vertical
timber
with
spiral
grain
is
also
known
as
torse
wood
spiral
grain
usually
can
not
be
detected
by
casual
inspection
of
a
stick
since
it
does
not
show
in
the
visible
grain
of
the
wood
by
which
is
commonly
meant
a
sectional
view
of
the
annual
rings
of
growth
cut
longitudinally
it
is
accordingly
very
easy
to
allow
material
to
pass
inspection
thereby
introducing
an
element
of
weakness
in
a
structure
there
are
methods
for
readily
detecting
spiral
grain
the
simplest
is
that
of
splitting
a
small
piece
radially
it
is
necessary
of
course
that
the
split
be
radial
that
is
in
a
plane
passing
through
the
axis
of
the
log
and
not
tangentially
in
the
latter
case
it
is
quite
probable
that
the
wood
would
split
straight
the
line
of
cleavage
being
between
the
growth
rings
in
inspection
the
elements
to
examine
are
the
rays
in
the
case
of
oak
and
certain
other
hardwoods
these
rays
are
so
large
that
they
are
readily
seen
not
only
on
a
radial
surface
but
on
the
tangential
as
well
on
the
former
they
appear
as
flakes
on
the
latter
as
short
lines
since
these
rays
are
between
the
fibres
it
naturally
follows
that
they
will
be
vertical
or
inclined
according
as
the
tree
is
or
while
they
are
not
conspicuous
in
the
softwoods
they
can
be
seen
upon
close
scrutiny
and
particularly
so
if
a
small
hand
magnifier
is
used
when
wood
has
begun
to
dry
and
check
it
is
very
easy
to
see
whether
or
not
it
is
or
since
the
checks
will
for
the
most
part
follow
along
the
rays
if
one
examines
a
row
of
telephone
poles
for
example
he
will
probably
find
that
most
of
them
have
checks
running
spirally
around
them
if
boards
were
sawed
from
such
a
pole
after
it
was
badly
checked
they
would
fall
to
pieces
of
their
own
weight
the
only
way
to
get
straight
material
would
be
to
split
it
out
it
is
for
this
reason
that
split
billets
and
squares
are
stronger
than
most
sawed
material
the
presence
of
the
spiral
grain
has
little
if
any
effect
on
the
timber
when
it
is
used
in
the
round
but
in
sawed
material
the
greater
the
pitch
of
the
spiral
the
greater
is
the
defect

lumber
but
in
timber
the
damage
is
much
greater
when
shake
consists
of
several
radial
clefts
it
is
termed
in
some
instances
one
or
more
of
these
clefts
may
extend
nearly
to
the
bark
in
felled
or
converted
timber
clefts
due
to
heart
shake
may
be
distinguished
from
seasoning
cracks
by
the
darker
color
of
the
exposed
surfaces
such
clefts
however
tend
to
open
up
more
and
more
as
the
timber
seasons
or
results
from
the
pulling
apart
of
two
or
more
growth
rings
it
is
one
of
the
most
serious
defects
to
which
sound
timber
is
subject
as
it
seriously
reduces
the
technical
properties
of
wood
it
is
very
common
in
sycamore
and
in
western
larch
particularly
in
the
butt
portion
its
occurrence
is
most
frequent
at
the
junction
of
two
growth
layers
of
very
unequal
thickness
consequently
it
is
likely
to
occur
in
trees
which
have
grown
slowly
for
a
time
then
abruptly
increased
due
to
improved
conditions
of
light
and
food
as
in
thinning
old
timber
is
more
subject
to
it
than
young
trees
the
damage
is
largely
confined
to
the
butt
log
cup
shake
is
often
associated
with
other
forms
of
shake
and
not
infrequently
shows
traces
of
decay
the
causes
of
cup
shake
are
uncertain
the
swaying
action
of
the
wind
may
result
in
shearing
apart
the
growth
layers
especially
in
trees
growing
in
exposed
places
frost
may
in
some
instances
be
responsible
for
cup
shake
or
at
least
a
contributing
factor
although
trees
growing
in
regions
free
from
frost
often
have
ring
shake
shrinkage
of
the
heartwood
may
be
concentric
as
well
as
radial
in
its
action
thus
producing
cup
shake
instead
of
or
in
connection
with
heart
shake
a
local
defect
somewhat
similar
in
effect
to
cup
shake
is
known
as
if
the
cambium
layer
is
exposed
by
the
removal
of
the
entire
bark
or
rind
it
will
die
subsequent
growth
over
the
damaged
portion
does
not
cohere
with
the
wood
previously
formed
by
the
old
cambium
the
defect
resulting
is
termed
rind
gall
the
most
common
causes
of
it
are
fire
gnawing
blazing
chipping
sun
scald
lightning
and
abrasions
is
a
term
applied
to
areas
of
compression
failure
along
the
grain
found
in
occasional
logs
sometimes
these
breaks
are
invisible
until
the
wood
is
manufactured
into
the
finished
article
the
occurrence
of
this
defect
is
mostly
limited
to
the
dense
hardwoods
such
as
hickory
and
to
heavy
tropical
species
it
is
the
source
of
considerable
loss
in
the
fancy
veneer
industry
as
the
veneer
from
valuable
logs
so
affected
drops
to
pieces
the
cause
of
heart
break
is
not
positively
known
it
is
highly
probable
however
that
when
the
tree
is
felled
the
trunk
strikes
across
a
rock
or
another
log
and
the
impact
causes
actual
failure
in
the
log
as
in
a
beam
or
are
of
common
occurrence
in
the
wood
of
larch
spruce
fir
and
especially
of
longleaf
and
other
hard
pines
they
are
due
to
accumulations
of
resin
in
openings
between
adjacent
layers
of
growth
they
are
more
frequent
in
trees
growing
alone
than
in
those
of
dense
stands
the
pockets
are
usually
a
few
inches
in
greatest
dimension
and
affect
only
one
or
two
growth
layers
they
are
hidden
until
exposed
by
the
saw
rendering
it
impossible
to
cut
lumber
with
reference
to
their
position
often
several
boards
are
damaged
by
a
single

are
constantly
being
destroyed

almost
invariably
they
are
confined
to
salt
water
and
all
the
woods
commonly
used
for

are
subject
to
their
attacks
there
are
two
genera
of
mollusks
and
and
three
of

and
that
do
serious

in
many
places
along
both

these
mollusks
which
are
popularly
known
as
shipworms
are
much
alike
in
structure
and
mode
of
life
they
attack
the
exposed
surface
of

and
immediately
begin
to
bore
the
tunnels

the
sole
object
of

the

both
the

pine
the
locality
where

appears
to
have

little

on

there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
longleaf
pine
from
one
state
is
better
than
that
from
any
other
since
such
variations
as
are
claimed
can
be
found
on
any
lot
of
timber
in
any
state
but
with
loblolly
and
still
more
with
shortleaf
this
seems
not
to
be
the
case
being
widely
distributed
over
many
localities
different
in
soil
and
climate
the
growth
of
the
shortleaf
pine
seems
materially
influenced
by
location
the
wood
from
the
southern
coast
and
gulf
region
and
even
arkansas
is
generally
heavier
than
the
wood
from
localities
farther
north
very
light
and
wood
is
seldom
met
near
the
southern
limit
of
the
range
while
it
is
almost
the
rule
in
missouri
where
forms
resembling
the
norway
pine
are
by
no
means
rare
the
loblolly
occupying
both
wet
and
dry
soils
varies
accordingly
cir
no
it
is
clear
that
as
all
localities
have
their
heavy
and
their
light
timber
so
they
all
share
in
strong
and
weak
hard
and
soft
material
and
the
difference
in
quality
of
material
is
evidently
far
more
a
matter
of
individual
variation
than
of
soil
or
climate
a
representative
committee
of
the
carriage
association
had
publicly
declared
that
this
important
industry
could
not
depend
upon
the
supplies
of
southern
timber
as
the
oak
grown
in
the
south
lacked
the
necessary
qualities
demanded
in
carriage
construction
without
experiment
this
statement
could
be
little
better
than
a
guess
and
was
doubly
unwarranted
since
it
condemned
an
enormous
amount
of
material
and
one
produced
under
a
great
variety
of
conditions
and
by
at
least
a
dozen
species
of
trees
involving
therefore
a
complexity
of
problems
difficult
enough
for
the
careful
investigator
and
entirely
beyond
the
few
unsystematic
observations
of
the
members
of
a
committee
on
a
flying
trip
through
one
of
the
greatest
timber
regions
of
the
world
a
number
of
samples
were
at
once
collected
part
of
them
supplied
by
the
carriage
builders
committee
and
the
fallacy
of
the
broad
statement
mentioned
was
fully
demonstrated
by
a
short
series
of
tests
and
a
more
extensive
study
into
structure
and
weight
of
these
materials
from
these
tests
it
appears
that
pieces
of

from

excelled

strength
fully
equal

being
as
against

the
trees
had
about
twice
as
many
rings
per

as

from

this
however
is
not
very
significant
as
trees
of
the
same
species
age
and
size
growing
side
by
side
under
the
same
conditions
of
soil
and
situation
show
great
variation
in
their
technical
value
it
is
hard
to
account
for
this
difference
but
it
seems
that
trees
growing
in
wet
or
moist
situations
are
rather
inferior
to
those
growing
on
fresher
soil
also
it
is
claimed
by
many
hickory
users
that
the
wood
from
limestone
soils
is
superior
to
that
from
sandy
soils
one
of
the
moot
questions
among
hickory
men
is
the
relative
value
of
northern
and
southern
hickory
the
impression
prevails
that
southern
hickory
is
more
porous
and
brash
than
hickory
from
the
north
the
tests
indicate
that
southern
hickory
is
as
tough
and
strong
as
northern
hickory
of
the
same
age
but
the
southern
hickories
have
a
greater
tendency
to
be
shaky
and
this
results
in
much
waste
in
trees
from
southern
river
bottoms
the
loss
through
shakes
and
in
many
cases
amounts
to
as
much
as
per
cent
it
is
clear
therefore
that
the
difference
in
northern
and
southern
hickory
is
not
due
to
geographic
location
but
rather
to
the
character
of
timber
that
is
being
cut
nearly
all
of
that
from
southern
river
bottoms
and
from
the
cumberland
mountains
is
from
large
trees
that
from
the
north
is
from
younger
trees
which
are
grown
under
more
favorable
conditions
and
it
is
due
simply
to
the
greater
age
of
the
southern
trees
that
hickory
from
that
region
is
lighter
and
more
brash
than
that
from
the
north
bul
pp
season
of
cutting
it
is
generally
believed
that
timber
has
decided
advantages
over
that
cut
at
other
seasons
of
the
year
and
to
that
cause
alone
are
frequently
ascribed
much
greater
durability
less
liability
to
check
and
split
better
color
and
even
increased
strength
and
toughness
the
conclusion
from
the
various
experiments
made
on
the
subject
is
that
while
the
time
of
felling
may
and
often
does
affect
the
properties
of
wood
such
result
is
due
to
the
weather
conditions
rather
than
to
the
condition
of
the
wood
there
are
two
phases
of
this
question
one
is
concerned
with
the
physiological
changes
which
might
take
place
during
the
year
in
the
wood
of
a
living
tree
the
other
deals
with
the
purely
physical
results
due
to
the
weather
as
differences
in
temperature
humidity
moisture
and
other
features
to
be
mentioned
later
those
who
adhere
to
the
first
view
maintain
that
wood
cut
in
summer
is
quite
different
in
composition
from
that
cut
in
winter
one
opinion
is
that
in
summer
the
sap
is
up
while
in
winter
it
is
down
consequently
timber
is
drier
a
variation
of
this
belief
is
that
in
summer
the
sap
contains
certain
chemicals
which
affect
the
properties
of
wood
and
does
not
contain
them
in
winter
again
it
is
sometimes
asserted
that
wood
is
actually
denser
in
winter
than
in
summer
as
part
of
the
wood
substance
is
dissolved
out
in
the
spring
and
used
for
plant
food
being
restored
in
the
fall
it
is
obvious
that
such
views
could
apply
only
to
sapwood
since
it
alone
is
in
living
condition
at
the
time
of
cutting
heartwood
is
dead
wood
and
has
almost
no
function
in
the
existence
of
the
tree
other
than
the
purely
mechanical
one
of
support
heartwood
does
undergo
changes
but
they
are
gradual
and
almost
entirely
independent
of
the
seasons
sapwood
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
respond
to
seasonal
changes
and
to
some
extent
it
does
just
beneath
the
bark
there
is
a
thin
layer
of
cells
which
during
the
growing
season
have
not
attained
their
greatest
density
with
the
exception
of
this
one
annual
ring
or
portion
of
one
the
density
of
the
wood
substance
of
the
sapwood
is
nearly
the
same
the
year
round
slight
variations
may
occur
due
to
impregnation
with
sugar
and
starch
in
the
winter
and
its
dissolution
in
the
growing
season
the
time
of
cutting
can
have
no
material
effect
on
the
inherent
strength
and
other
mechanical
properties
of
wood
except
in
the
outermost
annual
ring
of
growth
the
popular
belief
that
sap
is
up
in
the
spring
and
summer
and
is
down
in
the
winter
has
not
been
substantiated
by
experiment
there
are
seasonal
differences
in
the
composition
of
sap
but
so
far
as
the
amount
of
sap
in
a
tree
is
concerned
there
is
fully
as
much
if
not
more
during
the
winter
than
in
summer
wood
is
not
drier
to
begin
with
than
in

it
is
likely
to

the
important
consideration
in
regard
to
this
question
is
the
series
of
circumstances
attending
the
handling
of
the
timber
after
it
is
felled
wood
dries
more
rapidly
in
summer
than
in
winter
not
because
there
is
less
moisture
at
one
time
than
another
but
because
of
the
higher
temperature
in
summer
this
greater
heat
is
often
accompanied
by
low
humidity
and
conditions
are
favorable
for
the
rapid
removal
of
moisture
from
the
exposed
portions
of
wood
wood
dries
by
evaporation
and
other
things
being
equal
this
will
proceed
much
faster
in
hot
weather
than
in
cold
it
is
a
matter
of
common
observation
that
when
wood
dries
it
shrinks
and
if
shrinkage
is
not
uniform
in
all
directions
the
material
pulls
apart
causing
season
checks
see
fig
if
evaporation
proceeds
more
rapidly
on
the
outside
than
inside
the
greater
shrinkage
of
the
outer
portions
is
bound
to
result
in
many
checks
the
number
and
size
increasing
with
the
degree
of
inequality
of
drying
in
cold
weather
drying
proceeds
slowly
but
uniformly
thus
allowing
the
wood
elements
to
adjust
themselves
with
the
least
amount
of
rupturing
in
summer
drying
proceeds
rapidly
and
irregularly
so
that
material
seasoned
at
that
time
is
more
likely
to
split
and
check
there
is
less
danger
of
sap
rot
when
trees
are
felled
in
winter
because
the
fungus
does
not
grow
in
the
very
cold
weather
and
the
lumber
has
a
chance
to
season
to
below
the
danger
point
before
the
fungus
gets
a
chance
to
attack
it
if
the
logs
in

at
once
evident
that
this
fact
makes
shrinkage
more
irregular
for
wherever
cells
cross
each
other
at
a
decided
angle
they
will
tend
to
pull
apart
upon
drying
this
occurs
wherever
pith
rays
and
wood
fibres
meet
a
considerable
portion
of
every
wood
is
made
up
of
these
rays
which
for
the
most
part
have
their
cells
lying
in
a
radial
direction
instead
of
longitudinally
see
frontispiece
in
pine
over
of
these
occur
on
a
square
inch
of
a
tangential
section
and
even
in
oak
the
very
large
rays
which
are
readily
visible
to
the
eye
as
flakes
on
material
represent
scarcely
one
per
cent
of
the
number
which
the
microscope
reveals
a
pith
ray
shrinks
in
height
and
width
that
is
vertically
and
tangentially
as
applied
to
the
position
in
a
standing
tree
but
very
little
in
length
or
radially
the
other
elements
of
the
wood
shrink
radially
and
tangentially
but
almost
none
lengthwise
or
vertically
as
applied
to
the
tree
here
then
we
find
the
shrinkage
of
the
rays
tending
to
shorten
a
stick
of
wood
while
the
other
cells
resist
it
and
the
tendency
of
a
stick
to
get
smaller
in
circumference
is
resisted
by
the
endwise
reaction
or
thrust
of
the
rays
only
in
a
tangential
direction
or
around
the
stick
in
direction
of
the
annual
rings
of
growth
do
the
two
forces
coincide
another
factor
to
the
same
end
is
that
the
denser
bands
of
late
wood
are
continuous
in
a
tangential
direction
while
radially
they
are
separated
by
alternate
zones
of
less
dense
early
wood
consequently
the
shrinkage
along
the
rings
tangential
is
fully
twice
as
much
as
toward
the
centre
radial
see
table
xiv
this
explains
why
some
cracks
open
more
and
more
as
drying
advances
see
fig
although
actual
shrinkage
in
length
is
small
nevertheless
the
tendency
of
the
rays
to
shorten
a
stick
produces
strains
which
are
responsible
for
some
of
the
splitting
open
of
ties
posts
and
sawed
timbers
with
box
heart
at
the
very
centre
of
a
tree
the
wood
is
light
and
weak
while
farther
out
it
becomes
denser
and
stronger
longitudinal
shrinkage
is
accordingly
least
at
the
centre
and
greater
toward
the
outside
tending
to
become
greatest
in
the
sapwood
when
a
round
or
a
timber
dries
fast
it
splits
radially
and
as
drying
continues
the
cleft
widens
partly
on
account
of
the
greater
tangential
shrinkage
and
also
because
the
greater
contraction
of
the
outer
fibres
warps
the
sections
apart
if
a
small
hardwood
stem
is
split
while
green
for
a
short
distance
at
the
end
and
placed
where
it
can
dry
out
rapidly
the
sections
will
become
with
the
concave
sides
out
these
various
facts
taken
together
explain
why
for
example
an
oak
tie
pole
or
log
may
split
open
its
entire
length
if
drying
proceeds
rapidly
and
far
enough
initial
stresses
in
the
living
trees
produce
a
similar
effect
when
the
log
is
sawn
into
boards
this
is
especially
so
in

to
a
less
extent
with
any
rapidly
grown
wood
the
use
of
thin
steel
clamps
to
prevent
large
checks

splits
is
now
a
common
practice
in
this
country

poles

it
has
been
for
a
long
time
in
european
countries
these
devices
are
driven
into

butts
of

timbers

as
to
cross

checks

prevent

another

of
about

in

is
very
carefully
determined
and
stated
with
the
results
in
the
tables
size
of
test
specimens
the
size
of
the
test
specimen
must
be
governed
largely
by
the
purpose
for
which
the
test
is
made
if
the
effect
of
a
single
factor
such
as
moisture
is
the
object
of
experiment
it
is
necessary
to
use
small
pieces
of
wood
in
order
to
eliminate
so
far
as
possible
all
disturbing
factors
if
the
specimens
are
too
large
it
is
impossible
to
secure
enough
perfect
pieces
from
one
tree
to
form
a
series
for
various
tests
moreover
the
drying
process
with
large
timbers
is
very
difficult
and
irregular
and
requires
a
long
period
of
time
besides
causing
checks
and
internal
stresses
which
may
obscure
the
results
obtained
on
the
other
hand
the
smaller
the
dimensions
of
the
test
specimen
the
greater
becomes
the
relative
effect
of
the
inherent
factors
affecting
the
mechanical
properties
for
example
the
effect
of
a
knot
of
given
size
is
more
serious
in
a
small
stick
than
in
a
large
one
moreover
the
smaller
the
specimen
the
fewer
growth
rings
it
contains
hence
there
is
greater
opportunity
for
variation
due
to
irregularities
of
grain
tests
on
large
timbers
are
considered
necessary
to
furnish
designers
data
on
the
probable
strength
of
the
different
sizes
and
grades
of
timber
on
the
market
their
coefficients
of
elasticity
under
bending
since
the
stiffness
rather
than
the
strength
often
determines
the
size
of
a
beam
and
the
manner
of
failure
whether
in
bending
fibre
stress
or
horizontal
shear
it
is
believed
that
this
information
can
only
be
obtained
by
direct
tests
on
the
different
grades
of
car
sills
stringers
and
other
material
in
common
use
when
small
pieces
are
selected
for
test
they
very
often
are
clear
and
and
thus
of
so
much
better
grade
than
the
large
sticks
that
tests
upon
them
may
not
yield
unit
values
applicable
to
the
larger
sizes
extensive
experiments
show
however
that
the
modulus
of
elasticity
is
approximately
the
same
for
large
timbers
as
for
small
clear
specimens
cut
from
them
and
that
the
fibre
stress
at
elastic
limit
for
large
beams
is

a
comparison

with
those
from

shows
that
without
exception
the

is
increased
by
lowering
the
moisture
content
but
that
increase
in
strength
of

sizes
is
much
more
erratic
some
specimens
in
fact
show
an
apparent
loss
in
strength
due
to
seasoning
if
structural
timbers
are
seasoned
slowly
in
order
to
avoid
excessive
checking
there
should
be
an
increase
in

in
the

it
